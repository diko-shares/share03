00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:48.474
<i>NEW YORK CITY...</i>

2
00:00:48.498 --> 00:00:50.443
<i>NO MATTER HOW WELL
YOU THINK YOU KNOW IT,</i>

3
00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:54.169
<i>THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEWHERE
OR SOMEONE NEW TO DISCOVER.</i>

4
00:00:54.238 --> 00:00:57.523
<i>I WAS ON MY SECOND DATE WITH
RAY KING, WHO LIVED IN QUEENS,</i>

5
00:00:57.591 --> 00:00:59.991
<i>ALTHOUGH IT FELT LIKE OUR
SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH DATE</i>

6
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:02.594
<i>BECAUSE WE'D BEEN TO
THREE JAZZ CLUBS IN ONE NIGHT.</i>

7
00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:05.531
I CAN'T SING FOR SHIT,
BUT DAMN, CAN I CHOP.

8
00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:07.660
AND WHERE DOES ONE
LEARN THIS SKILL?

9
00:01:07.684 --> 00:01:08.750
JERSEY SHORE.

10
00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:09.863
OH, IS THAT WHERE
YOU'RE FROM...

11
00:01:09.887 --> 00:01:10.969
LISTEN.

12
00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:12.237
THIS LICK RIGHT HERE

13
00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:13.706
IS WHY I WANTED
TO PLAY THE BASS.

14
00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:17.025
MAN...

15
00:01:17.094 --> 00:01:18.326
HOW ABOUT THAT?

16
00:01:19.196 --> 00:01:21.529
JESUS, THAT'S SWEET.

17
00:01:21.598 --> 00:01:23.398
LISTEN TO
THAT AGAIN.

18
00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:34.475
YEAH, YEAH?

19
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.500
HOW ABOUT THAT?

20
00:01:45.756 --> 00:01:47.789
THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD
TIME TO TELL YOU...

21
00:01:48.926 --> 00:01:50.458
I DON'T LIKE JAZZ.

22
00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:57.699
WHY WOULD YOU SAY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

23
00:01:57.768 --> 00:01:59.579
I DUNNO, YOU
CAN'T FOLLOW IT

24
00:01:59.603 --> 00:02:01.853
AND THERE'S NO MELODY.

25
00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:04.321
AND IT'S JUST...
IT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE.

26
00:02:04.358 --> 00:02:07.675
CARRIE, YOU GOTTA STOP TRYING
TO MAKE IT BE SOMETHING ELSE

27
00:02:07.745 --> 00:02:10.045
AND APPRECIATE IT
FOR WHAT IT IS.

28
00:02:10.114 --> 00:02:11.947
DAMN, I WISH
I HAD MY BASS.

29
00:02:13.617 --> 00:02:16.418
COME HERE, YOU
BE THE BASS.

30
00:02:16.486 --> 00:02:18.931
DON'T I HAVE TO BE IN
THE MUSICIAN'S UNION
OR SOMETHING?

31
00:02:18.955 --> 00:02:20.088
AH, AH, AH.

32
00:02:20.156 --> 00:02:21.701
DO YOU PLAY ALL
THOSE INSTRUMENTS?

33
00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:22.868
"PLAY" IS
A LITTLE STRONG.

34
00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:25.527
I LEARN A FEW NOTES,
I GET BORED, I MOVE ON.

35
00:02:26.296 --> 00:02:28.096
LISTEN TO THE BASS.

36
00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.199
THE BEAUTY OF JAZZ...

37
00:02:31.268 --> 00:02:33.668
IS THAT IT CAN
GO ANYWHERE.

38
00:02:33.737 --> 00:02:35.503
IT CAN GO
FROM HERE...

39
00:02:37.374 --> 00:02:38.707
TO HERE...

40
00:02:40.944 --> 00:02:42.310
TO HERE...

41
00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.717
<i>IT WAS RIGHT ABOUT THAT TIME
THAT I STARTED TO APPRECIATE</i>

42
00:02:48.785 --> 00:02:51.586
<i>A LITTLE TYPE OF
MUSIC WE CALL JAZZ.</i>

43
00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:57.337
SO WHAT DID YOU DO
LAST NIGHT, CARRIE?

44
00:02:57.361 --> 00:02:58.993
I LISTENED TO JAZZ.

45
00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.529
WHAT IS SO FUNNY
ABOUT JAZZ?

46
00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:06.551
OKAY, HERE IT IS.

47
00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:10.422
LAST NIGHT,
WITH RAY...

48
00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:12.890
I HAD...

49
00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:18.296
THE MOST INTENSE ORGASM
OF MY ENTIRE LIFE.

50
00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:21.494
I DID MY LAUNDRY...

51
00:03:21.518 --> 00:03:22.850
CONTINUE.

52
00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.019
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE,
I BARELY KNOW HIM.

53
00:03:25.088 --> 00:03:26.688
WE'VE ONLY BEEN
ON TWO DATES.

54
00:03:26.774 --> 00:03:28.401
AND YET YOU HAD
SEX WITH HIM.

55
00:03:28.425 --> 00:03:31.693
CAN EVERYONE PLEASE LET
CARRIE TALK ABOUT THE SEX?

56
00:03:31.762 --> 00:03:33.795
THE MIND-BLOWING SEX.

57
00:03:33.864 --> 00:03:35.097
NOW...

58
00:03:35.165 --> 00:03:38.499
I REALIZE THAT
THIS NEXT STATEMENT

59
00:03:38.568 --> 00:03:40.836
MAKES ME A BIT OF
A FREAK, BUT, UM...

60
00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:45.657
I USUALLY HAVE TO BE
IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE

61
00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:47.793
TO HAVE THAT
KIND OF ORGASM.

62
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:49.589
YOU MIGHT WANT TO SEE
SOMEONE ABOUT THAT.

63
00:03:49.613 --> 00:03:51.963
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

64
00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:53.776
MAYBE RAY IS
"THE ONE."

65
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.528
YOUR CLITORIS
SEEMS TO THINK SO.

66
00:03:55.552 --> 00:03:57.452
IT WAS PROBABLY
JUST A FLUKE.

67
00:03:57.521 --> 00:03:59.521
I'M GOING BACK
TOMORROW TO FIND OUT.

68
00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:01.990
I, ON THE OTHER HAND,
AM ON STRIKE.

69
00:04:02.058 --> 00:04:03.324
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

70
00:04:03.393 --> 00:04:05.861
IT MEANS I'M NOT
HAVING ANY MORE SEX.

71
00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:08.210
THAT'S NOT A STRIKE,
HONEY, THAT'S A SLUMP.

72
00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.299
NO, IT MIGHT HAVE
STARTED AS A SLUMP,

73
00:04:10.367 --> 00:04:12.012
BUT I'M IN CONTROL
OF IT NOW.

74
00:04:12.036 --> 00:04:14.386
I'VE MADE THE CONSCIOUS
DECISION NOT TO HAVE SEX

75
00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:15.965
UNTIL CONDITIONS
IMPROVE.

76
00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.109
AND HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL BE
AFFECTED BY THIS STRIKE?

77
00:04:18.141 --> 00:04:21.542
UM, SO FAR, JUST THE ONE,
BUT I'M OPTIMISTIC.

78
00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:23.559
THE THING IS,

79
00:04:23.613 --> 00:04:27.281
I CAN'T GO ON ANY
MORE BAD DATES.

80
00:04:27.351 --> 00:04:30.251
I WOULD RATHER BE HOME ALONE
THAN OUT WITH SOME GUY

81
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.732
WHO SELLS SOCKS
ON THE INTERNET.

82
00:04:32.756 --> 00:04:35.106
WELL, I'M DATING
SOMEONE.

83
00:04:36.126 --> 00:04:38.038
SOMEONE I
ACTUALLY LIKE.

84
00:04:38.062 --> 00:04:39.342
WOW!

85
00:04:39.896 --> 00:04:41.063
MARIA.

86
00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:47.385
MARIA, MARIA, MY MARIA,
FROM THE GALLERY?

87
00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:50.288
WELL, SHE'S MY MARIA
NOW, WE'RE HAVING A...

88
00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:51.556
RELATIONSHIP.

89
00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:55.193
YES, LADIES,
I'M A LESBIAN.

90
00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.430
WAIT A SECOND.

91
00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:01.466
YOU'RE IN
A RELATIONSHIP?

92
00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:03.001
YES...

93
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.519
AND SHE JUST
WALKED IN,

94
00:05:04.588 --> 00:05:06.321
SO, PLEASE GET THOSE
LOOKS OFF YOUR FACES.

95
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.789
MARIA!

96
00:05:13.597 --> 00:05:14.607
HELLO.

97
00:05:14.631 --> 00:05:15.964
YOU KNOW
CHARLOTTE.

98
00:05:16.033 --> 00:05:17.093
OH, YEAH, SURE.

99
00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:18.900
AND THIS IS
CARRIE AND MIRANDA.

100
00:05:21.505 --> 00:05:23.372
I SEE YOU TOLD THEM.

101
00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:27.008
HOW DOES THAT WORK?

102
00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:29.288
YOU GO TO BED ONE
NIGHT, YOU WAKE UP
THE NEXT MORNING,

103
00:05:29.312 --> 00:05:30.724
AND POOF,
YOU'RE A LESBIAN?

104
00:05:30.748 --> 00:05:32.659
OH, I FORGOT TO TELL YOU,
I'M A FIRE HYDRANT.

105
00:05:32.683 --> 00:05:34.761
YEAH, I'M A SHOE.

106
00:05:34.785 --> 00:05:38.086
I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE ONE,
AND, POOF, NOW I AM.

107
00:05:38.154 --> 00:05:40.989
I DON'T THINK SHE'S
A LESBIAN, I THINK SHE
JUST RAN OUT OF MEN.

108
00:05:41.057 --> 00:05:43.892
THEN YOU GO ON STRIKE,
YOU DON'T EAT PUSSY.

109
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.960
EW!

110
00:05:44.995 --> 00:05:46.461
DID YOU JUST SAY...

111
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.029
"EAT PUSSY"?

112
00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:50.231
I DID, BUT JUST
FOR EMPHASIS.

113
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.537
YOU KNOW, THE TRULY
AMAZING THING IS,

114
00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:57.250
I HAD THE NEWS
TONIGHT.

115
00:05:57.274 --> 00:05:59.974
I HAD THE MOST INTENSE...

116
00:06:00.043 --> 00:06:01.721
"MIND-BLOWING,"
I BELIEVE WAS THE WORD.

117
00:06:01.745 --> 00:06:03.311
ORGASM OF MY LIFE,

118
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.415
AND SAMANTHA STILL
MANAGED TO UP-SEX ME.

119
00:06:12.989 --> 00:06:15.590
THEY MET AT MY GALLERY.
I INTRODUCED THEM.

120
00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:17.992
POOF, YOU'RE A PIMP.

121
00:06:18.061 --> 00:06:19.844
<i>LATER THAT NIGHT,</i>

122
00:06:19.913 --> 00:06:22.858
<i>INSPIRED BY</i>
<i>SAMANTHA'S WILLINGNESS</i>
<i>TO EXPLORE NEW TERRITORY,</i>

123
00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:26.484
<i>CHARLOTTE FELT IT</i>
<i>WAS TIME TO CONQUER</i>
<i>SOME OLD TERRITORY.</i>

124
00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:28.353
<i>THE BED,</i>

125
00:06:28.422 --> 00:06:31.472
<i>WHERE SHE AND TREY</i>
<i>HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE</i>
<i>AS MAN AND WIFE.</i>

126
00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:32.821
HERE WE ARE.

127
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.442
YEP.

128
00:06:35.846 --> 00:06:38.258
SHOULD WE HAVE A GLASS
OF WINE FIRST?

129
00:06:38.282 --> 00:06:39.514
I'M FINE, UNLESS YOU...

130
00:06:39.582 --> 00:06:41.382
NO, NO, I'M OKAY.

131
00:06:47.157 --> 00:06:48.623
IF YOU DON'T
FEEL READY...

132
00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:02.298
<i>JUST BECAUSE
SHE WAS ON STRIKE</i>

133
00:07:02.322 --> 00:07:04.489
<i>DIDN'T MEAN SHE
HAD TO DO WITHOUT.</i>

134
00:07:06.893 --> 00:07:09.927
<i>THAT'S HOW MIRANDA DISCOVERED
THE PERFECT RELATIONSHIP...</i>

135
00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:14.465
<i>JON STEWART AND
CHOCOLATE ECLAIRS.</i>

136
00:07:14.534 --> 00:07:17.413
<i>Be here today and she is,
from what I understand,</i>

137
00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:20.004
<i>in love with me.</i>

138
00:07:20.073 --> 00:07:22.907
<i>THAT NIGHT, CHARLOTTE AND
TREY ENJOYED A SWEET ENDING</i>

139
00:07:22.976 --> 00:07:24.575
<i>TO THEIR EVENING AS WELL.</i>

140
00:07:26.146 --> 00:07:27.578
NOT BAD, HUH?

141
00:07:29.883 --> 00:07:32.617
IT WAS ALMOST
"MIND-BLOWING".

142
00:07:32.685 --> 00:07:34.585
<i>CHARLOTTE WAS RELIEVED.</i>

143
00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:37.333
<i>NOW THAT THEY HAD</i>
<i>FIXED THEIR PROBLEM</i>
<i>IN THE BEDROOM,</i>

144
00:07:37.357 --> 00:07:40.524
<i>SHE WAS READY TO</i>
<i>MOVE BACK INTO THE</i>
<i>OTHER ROOMS AS WELL.</i>

145
00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:42.574
SO...

146
00:07:44.064 --> 00:07:46.798
WHAT ARE
YOU THINKING?

147
00:07:46.867 --> 00:07:51.402
I'M THINKING I'VE NEVER SEEN
MY JOHN THOMAS SO HARD.

148
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.704
I SWEAR, CHARLOTTE,
AT TIMES I FELT LIKE

149
00:07:53.774 --> 00:07:55.573
IT WAS GONNA
ROCKET RIGHT OFF.

150
00:07:57.343 --> 00:07:58.843
WHAT WERE
YOU THINKING?

151
00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:02.747
I DON'T KNOW. UM...

152
00:08:05.385 --> 00:08:06.665
SHOULD I...

153
00:08:11.257 --> 00:08:12.537
DO YOU...

154
00:08:15.762 --> 00:08:17.162
ARE WE READY TO...

155
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.530
GO AGAIN?

156
00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:24.735
HOUSTON, WE DON'T
HAVE A PROBLEM.

157
00:08:26.173 --> 00:08:28.573
THREE-TWO-ONE,

158
00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:29.652
BLASTOFF!

159
00:08:33.697 --> 00:08:34.862
WHO IS IT?

160
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:36.397
<i>It's Ray.</i>

161
00:08:36.466 --> 00:08:38.532
OH, HI,
COME ON UP.

162
00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:40.835
OH, SHIT.

163
00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:45.941
HELLO?

164
00:08:45.976 --> 00:08:48.093
SO, DID YOU
AND THE GIRLS

165
00:08:48.161 --> 00:08:50.128
RUN DOWN THE STREET
TALKING ABOUT ME?

166
00:08:50.197 --> 00:08:51.112
MAYBE.

167
00:08:51.181 --> 00:08:52.480
<i>How many blocks?</i>

168
00:08:52.549 --> 00:08:56.651
UH, TWO,
OKAY, NINE.

169
00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.637
HONESTLY, I'M
A LITTLE HURT.

170
00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:00.683
I MEAN, AFTER ALL THE HOURS
I'VE SPENT LISTENING

171
00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:02.867
TO YOU PEOPLE TALK
ABOUT <i>YOUR</i> RELATIONSHIPS.

172
00:09:04.011 --> 00:09:05.276
YOU DO THAT?

173
00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:06.978
<i>I make the courtesy call.</i>

174
00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:09.580
"DO YOU THINK YOU LOVE
HIM? BLAH, BLAH, BLAH."

175
00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:12.250
WELL, YOU JUST CAUGHT
US A LITTLE OFF GUARD

176
00:09:12.319 --> 00:09:13.559
WITH THE LESBIAN THING.

177
00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:16.020
THAT'S JUST A LABEL,
LIKE GUCCI OR VERSACE.

178
00:09:16.089 --> 00:09:17.488
OR BIRKENSTOCK.

179
00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:20.025
THIS IS NOT ABOUT BEING
GAY OR STRAIGHT.

180
00:09:20.093 --> 00:09:22.309
<i>Maria is an incredible woman.</i>

181
00:09:22.378 --> 00:09:24.712
SHE'S GOT PASSION,
AND TALENT,

182
00:09:24.781 --> 00:09:25.830
<i>intelligence...</i>

183
00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.499
A VAGINA.

184
00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:29.401
OH, VAGINA SCHMAGINA.

185
00:09:29.469 --> 00:09:30.969
"SCHMAGINA"?

186
00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:33.555
IS THAT WHAT THE LESBIANS
ARE CALLING IT?

187
00:09:33.623 --> 00:09:36.107
FOR YOUR INFORMATION, WE
HAVEN'T EVEN HAD SEX YET.

188
00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:39.244
WOW, YOU REALLY ARE
IN A RELATIONSHIP.

189
00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:42.981
<i>Yes, I am, Carrie, life
is not all about sex.</i>

190
00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:45.850
TRY TELLING THAT
TO HER SCHMAGINA.

191
00:09:45.902 --> 00:09:48.603
I WANT A BOURBON AND I
WANT TO GO DOWN ON YOU.

192
00:09:49.573 --> 00:09:51.889
NOT NECESSARILY
IN THAT ORDER.

193
00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.524
<i>The truth is...</i>

194
00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:56.377
I REALLY WANT IT TO BE
SPECIAL THE FIRST TIME.

195
00:09:56.446 --> 00:09:59.614
WELL, I'M SURE THAT
IT WILL BE SPECIAL.

196
00:09:59.683 --> 00:10:04.853
I'M SURE IT WILL BE
SPECIAL, BECAUSE...

197
00:10:04.921 --> 00:10:07.188
<i>Is Ray there?</i>

198
00:10:07.256 --> 00:10:09.256
NO, NO, NO, SAMANTHA,
I'M LISTENING...

199
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.827
I'M LISTENING.

200
00:10:12.896 --> 00:10:15.341
<i>THE NEXT DAY, I THOUGHT
ABOUT WHAT SAMANTHA SAID.</i>

201
00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:17.097
<i>SHE WASN'T HAVING SEX</i>

202
00:10:17.166 --> 00:10:18.911
<i>BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP,</i>

203
00:10:18.935 --> 00:10:20.680
<i>AND I WAS HAVING
MIND-BLOWING SEX,</i>

204
00:10:20.704 --> 00:10:23.003
<i>HOPING TO TURN IT
INTO A RELATIONSHIP.</i>

205
00:10:23.073 --> 00:10:24.405
<i>SO THERE YOU HAVE IT.</i>

206
00:10:24.474 --> 00:10:26.624
<i>WE'VE GOT A RELATIONSHIP
WITHOUT SEX</i>

207
00:10:26.693 --> 00:10:28.387
<i>AND SEX WITHOUT
A RELATIONSHIP.</i>

208
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:31.129
<i>WHICH HAD A BETTER
SHOT AT SURVIVAL?</i>

209
00:10:31.197 --> 00:10:32.608
<i>I COULDN'T HELP
BUT WONDER...</i>

210
00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:35.233
<i>WHAT COMES FIRST, THE
CHICKEN OR THE SEX?</i>

211
00:10:36.536 --> 00:10:39.704
<i>THAT NIGHT I DECIDED
TO REALLY TALK TO RAY.</i>

212
00:10:39.772 --> 00:10:43.474
<i>I FIGURED WE NEEDED TO</i>
<i>CATCH THE RELATIONSHIP</i>
<i>UP TO THE SEX.</i>

213
00:10:43.543 --> 00:10:45.910
<i>WELL, THAT
WAS THE PLAN.</i>

214
00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:49.314
WAIT, WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

215
00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:52.717
I ASKED YOU A QUESTION.
WHERE DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL?

216
00:10:53.386 --> 00:10:54.386
ALL OVER.

217
00:10:55.889 --> 00:10:58.389
OH, FRECKLES
ON THE LEGS,

218
00:10:58.458 --> 00:11:00.524
NOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT.

219
00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:03.261
<i>IT WAS MY BEST
RELATIONSHIP EVER.</i>

220
00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:07.732
<i>MEANWHILE, OVER AT
CASA DE LESBO...</i>

221
00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:09.745
THAT COQ AU VIN
WAS AMAZING.

222
00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:13.971
YOU CAN PAINT,
YOU CAN COOK, YOU
CAN DO EVERYTHING.

223
00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:23.715
BUT YOU BROUGHT THE MOST
INCREDIBLE DESSERT.

224
00:11:25.652 --> 00:11:27.017
WANNA BITE?

225
00:11:32.258 --> 00:11:35.159
<i>SAMANTHA DECIDED IF
SHE WAS GOING TO BE GAY,</i>

226
00:11:35.228 --> 00:11:37.194
<i>SHE'D BE GAY
ALL THE WAY.</i>

227
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:46.337
I MIGHT NOT BE MUCH
IN THE KITCHEN,

228
00:11:46.406 --> 00:11:49.139
BUT I'M MORE THAN
ENOUGH IN THE BEDROOM.

229
00:12:00.754 --> 00:12:02.034
OH, BABY.

230
00:12:02.538 --> 00:12:05.456
SAMANTHA.

231
00:12:05.525 --> 00:12:07.758
IT'S NOT REALLY
WORKING FOR ME.

232
00:12:09.162 --> 00:12:10.461
<i>IT WAS A PHRASE</i>

233
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.264
<i>SAMANTHA HAD NEVER
HEARD IN BED BEFORE.</i>

234
00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:17.035
WELL, HONEY, I'VE NEVER
GOTTEN ANY COMPLAINTS
FROM THE MEN.

235
00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:21.105
WELL, MEN...

236
00:12:23.043 --> 00:12:26.610
I WANT YOU TO
LOOK AT ME...

237
00:12:28.648 --> 00:12:30.614
CONNECT WITH ME.

238
00:12:32.552 --> 00:12:35.219
THIS IS LOVEMAKING.

239
00:12:35.288 --> 00:12:36.820
IT'S NOT
A PORNO FLICK.

240
00:12:38.491 --> 00:12:39.940
I WANT TO SHOW YOU.

241
00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.542
I'M GONNA LAY DOWN

242
00:12:41.611 --> 00:12:44.044
AND I WANT YOU TO
LOOK AT MY <i>BOCETA.</i>

243
00:12:46.066 --> 00:12:48.799
IT'S A PORTUGUESE
WORD FOR "PUSSY."

244
00:12:57.693 --> 00:12:58.904
<i>MEANWHILE, MIRANDA,</i>

245
00:12:58.928 --> 00:13:00.806
<i>STILL OFF SEX
AND ON CHOCOLATE,</i>

246
00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.941
<i>COULDN'T BRING HERSELF TO
ORDER THE SEVEN ECLAIRS</i>

247
00:13:02.965 --> 00:13:04.265
<i>SHE REALLY WANTED.</i>

248
00:13:04.334 --> 00:13:06.334
<i>SO SHE ASKED
FOR JUST ONE.</i>

249
00:13:06.402 --> 00:13:09.537
ONE CAKE, PLEASE.

250
00:13:09.606 --> 00:13:10.882
WHICH DO YOU
RECOMMEND?

251
00:13:10.906 --> 00:13:12.384
I'D GO WITH
THE LOUVRE.

252
00:13:12.408 --> 00:13:14.975
MONSIEUR PAYARD'S
SIGNATURE CHOCOLATE CAKE.

253
00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:16.210
WOW.

254
00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:17.679
SOLD.

255
00:13:17.747 --> 00:13:20.164
OKAY, THAT'LL
BE $74.50.

256
00:13:20.232 --> 00:13:22.800
AS IN 74 DOLLARS
AND 50 CENTS?

257
00:13:22.869 --> 00:13:24.335
YES.

258
00:13:24.404 --> 00:13:27.305
<i>MIRANDA DECIDED SHE DIDN'T
NEED A CAKE THAT BADLY...</i>

259
00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:34.194
<i>ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE</i>
<i>COULD MAKE ONE FOR</i>
<i>UNDER FIVE DOLLARS.</i>

260
00:13:34.264 --> 00:13:37.498
<i>EVERY ONCE IN</i>
<i>A WHILE, A GIRL HAS</i>
<i>TO INDULGE HERSELF.</i>

261
00:13:45.275 --> 00:13:46.307
OH!

262
00:13:56.335 --> 00:13:57.335
OH!

263
00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:03.518
TREY, I'M ON
THE MALLARD!

264
00:14:03.542 --> 00:14:04.741
SORRY.

265
00:14:55.561 --> 00:14:57.612
HE STILL HASN'T ASKED
ME TO MOVE BACK IN.

266
00:14:57.681 --> 00:15:00.259
WE MAKE LOVE ALL
OVER THE APARTMENT, AND
THEN IN THE MORNING

267
00:15:00.283 --> 00:15:02.060
I GET UP AND GET
IN A CAB AND GO HOME

268
00:15:02.084 --> 00:15:03.346
JUST LIKE
A PARK AVENUE HOOKER!

269
00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:04.563
CAN'T <i>YOU</i>
BRING IT UP?

270
00:15:04.587 --> 00:15:05.653
NO!

271
00:15:05.722 --> 00:15:06.932
WE FINALLY GOT
THE PENIS WORKING,

272
00:15:06.956 --> 00:15:08.673
I DON'T WANT
TO SCARE IT.

273
00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:10.886
WHY CAN'T I HAVE
THE RELATIONSHIP
AND THE SEX?

274
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.187
WHY IS IT ONE
OR THE OTHER?

275
00:15:12.211 --> 00:15:13.255
YOU GOT <i>ME.</i>

276
00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:14.378
I WANNA ORDER.

277
00:15:14.447 --> 00:15:15.927
WHERE'S THE LESBIAN
<i>DU JOUR</i>?

278
00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:18.615
OH, LISTEN, YOU GUYS,
WHEN SHE GETS HERE,

279
00:15:18.685 --> 00:15:21.130
WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT
HER RELATIONSHIP.

280
00:15:21.154 --> 00:15:23.499
SHE WAS KIND OF MAD
WE DIDN'T TAKE IT
SERIOUSLY LAST TIME.

281
00:15:23.523 --> 00:15:24.622
OH, PLEASE.

282
00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:25.935
SHE ISN'T HAVING
A RELATIONSHIP

283
00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:27.203
SHE'S JUST DOING
THIS TO BUG US.

284
00:15:27.227 --> 00:15:28.304
I DON'T KNOW.

285
00:15:28.328 --> 00:15:30.555
THEY HAVEN'T EVEN
HAD SEX YET.

286
00:15:30.579 --> 00:15:32.908
SHE SAID SHE WANTS
IT TO BE SPECIAL.

287
00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:33.932
REALLY?

288
00:15:33.967 --> 00:15:35.550
YEAH.

289
00:15:35.618 --> 00:15:37.835
WELL, THEN WE SHOULD
BE SUPPORTIVE.

290
00:15:37.904 --> 00:15:40.482
THIS IS THE HEALTHIEST
THING SAMANTHA'S DONE
IN A LONG TIME.

291
00:15:40.506 --> 00:15:42.626
DOES ANYBODY WANT TO SPLIT
THE CHOCOLATE PUDDING?

292
00:15:43.392 --> 00:15:44.875
MORNING, LADIES.

293
00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.878
MORNING.
HI!

294
00:15:50.082 --> 00:15:51.727
TELL US ABOUT
YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

295
00:15:51.751 --> 00:15:53.617
HOW IS EVERYTHING
GOING WITH MARIA?

296
00:15:53.686 --> 00:15:54.796
WELL...

297
00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.053
DID YOU KNOW

298
00:15:56.106 --> 00:15:58.089
THAT WHEN A VAGINA
GETS ENGORGED

299
00:15:58.157 --> 00:16:00.290
IT EXPANDS TO THE
SIZE OF A FIST?

300
00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:02.392
IT'S LIKE
A FABULOUS CAVE.

301
00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:04.006
I GUESS
THEY'VE HAD SEX.

302
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:05.329
APPARENTLY SO.

303
00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:07.431
AND WE HAVE <i>THREE</i>
HOLES DOWN THERE.

304
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.912
OKAY, STOP TALKING
ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

305
00:16:09.936 --> 00:16:11.252
BUT IT'S FASCINATING!

306
00:16:11.321 --> 00:16:13.265
THERE ARE PLACES
A DICK JUST CAN'T GO.

307
00:16:13.289 --> 00:16:15.690
SOME DICKS
MANAGE JUST FINE.

308
00:16:15.758 --> 00:16:18.318
PLEASE, MARIA
HAS <i>10</i> DICKS.

309
00:16:18.377 --> 00:16:20.244
FOR THE RECORD,
YOU STARTED THIS.

310
00:16:21.114 --> 00:16:22.513
I AM SORRY,

311
00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:25.949
BUT A FINGER
IS NOT A DICK.

312
00:16:26.019 --> 00:16:28.285
YES, A FINGER IS MORE
LIKE A THIRD OF A DICK,

313
00:16:28.354 --> 00:16:31.322
SO TECHNICALLY, MARIA ONLY
HAS THREE AND A THIRD DICKS.

314
00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:32.830
I CAN TELL YOU
RIGHT NOW,

315
00:16:32.858 --> 00:16:34.057
THIS...

316
00:16:35.611 --> 00:16:38.645
IS NOT THE SAME
AS THIS...

317
00:16:38.714 --> 00:16:40.747
OKAY, PUT THAT AWAY.

318
00:16:40.816 --> 00:16:44.246
I'M JUST SAYING,
SIZE HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

319
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.037
WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO YOU?

320
00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:48.384
I'M GETTING
AN EDUCATION.

321
00:16:48.408 --> 00:16:51.069
NOT ONLY DO I NOW
KNOW EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW

322
00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:53.338
ABOUT THE GLORIOUS
<i>BOCETA...</i>

323
00:16:53.362 --> 00:16:54.956
THAT'S PORTUGUESE
FOR "PUSSY."

324
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.508
<i>"BOCETA,</i>
SCHMAGINA,

325
00:16:56.532 --> 00:16:58.244
"LET'S CALL THE
WHOLE THING OFF."

326
00:16:58.268 --> 00:16:59.666
THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING

327
00:16:59.735 --> 00:17:03.404
IS THAT MARIA HAS TAUGHT ME
HOW TO CONNECT DURING SEX.

328
00:17:03.472 --> 00:17:05.306
IT'S NOT JUST
SOME ANIMAL ACT...

329
00:17:06.675 --> 00:17:09.676
IT'S ABOUT TWO
PEOPLE MAKING LOVE.

330
00:17:11.347 --> 00:17:12.446
YEAH.

331
00:17:14.417 --> 00:17:15.549
YEAH.

332
00:17:18.838 --> 00:17:20.804
HEY.
HI.

333
00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:22.251
I COULDN'T
PICK A SHIRT.

334
00:17:22.275 --> 00:17:23.507
RED, BLUE,
I DIDN'T KNOW.

335
00:17:23.576 --> 00:17:25.876
COME ON IN, I'M
MAKING MARGARITAS.

336
00:17:25.945 --> 00:17:27.077
HEY!

337
00:17:27.146 --> 00:17:29.586
LOOK WHAT
I BOUGHT TODAY.

338
00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:31.482
MY FIRST JAZZ CD.

339
00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:33.134
NO, NO, NO, NO.

340
00:17:34.203 --> 00:17:35.236
NO.

341
00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:37.338
YOU GOTTA HEAR
THAT ON VINYL.

342
00:17:39.358 --> 00:17:40.892
WAIT, RAY.

343
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.910

344
00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:45.963
RAY, STOP, DON'T

346
00:17:49.969 --> 00:17:51.235
COULD WE...

349

ARE YOU FROM?

354
00:18:11.123 --> 00:18:12.890
YOU SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT THE JERSEY SHORE.

355
00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:15.120
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
I SPENT A COUPLE
SUMMERS THERE.

356
00:18:15.144 --> 00:18:17.006

361
00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:25.814

362
00:18:25.838 --> 00:18:27.115
I LOVE THE SKEET.

363
00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:28.517

369
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:37.398

JUVENILE, I KNOW.

392
