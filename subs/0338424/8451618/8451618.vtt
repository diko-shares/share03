man: Oh, God!

00:03:33.016 --> 00:03:35.370
Oh, God. Come on.

00:03:35.394 --> 00:03:36.330
Melinda!

00:03:36.354 --> 00:03:38.439
Open up! It's me!

10
00:03:40.816 --> 00:03:42.085
Man: Hey, asshole!

11
00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.403
Use the door knocker.

12
00:03:45.404 --> 00:03:47.156
Oh.

13
00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:51.994
Oh! Oh, I love you!

14
00:03:59.169 --> 00:03:59.938
Melinda!

15
00:03:59.963 --> 00:04:01.796
Are you all right?!

16
00:04:01.838 --> 00:04:05.133
Oh, God! Danny, it's him!

17
00:04:05.175 --> 00:04:06.235
He followed us here!

18
00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:09.113
Hey, there is
somebody else in there!

19
00:04:09.137 --> 00:04:10.598
Open this door!

20
00:04:12.891 --> 00:04:15.478
Melinda! I...

21
00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:18.583
aah!

22
00:04:18.607 --> 00:04:21.234
Hey, hey, hey!

23
00:04:22.318 --> 00:04:23.254
Aah!

24
00:04:23.278 --> 00:04:26.215
Call the police!

25
00:04:26.239 --> 00:04:28.384
Unh!

26
00:04:28.408 --> 00:04:30.553
Hey, asshole, try the doorknob!

27
00:04:30.577 --> 00:04:33.205
Let me in!

28
00:04:35.165 --> 00:04:38.519
Get your hands off her!

29
00:04:38.543 --> 00:04:39.813
You.

30
00:04:39.837 --> 00:04:41.522
What? Meli...

31
00:04:41.546 --> 00:04:42.608
Jesus chr...

32
00:04:42.632 --> 00:04:45.068
you're screwing your husband?!

33
00:04:45.092 --> 00:04:45.945
Your husband.

34
00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:47.363
He followed me here,

35
00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:48.197
and we realized

36
00:04:48.222 --> 00:04:49.240
we deserve each other.

37
00:04:49.264 --> 00:04:51.450
Isn't that romantic, Dr. Klink?

38
00:04:51.474 --> 00:04:52.826
Roger.

39
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.203
Call me Roger, for Christ sakes.

40
00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:56.497
Maybe you should try going home

41
00:04:56.521 --> 00:04:58.415
and working it out
with your wife.

42
00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:00.835
Go to hell, Roger.

43
00:05:00.859 --> 00:05:03.212
Ex-wife, ex-home, ok?

44
00:05:03.236 --> 00:05:04.506
Melinda: I understand now

45
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.218
that I was transgressing
my love for Dan onto you,

46
00:05:08.242 --> 00:05:11.054
and you were
countertransgressing.

47
00:05:11.078 --> 00:05:13.122
Transferring! Bullshit!

48
00:05:13.164 --> 00:05:14.725
Yeah, any time a shrink

49
00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:16.309
is thinking about a patient
more than he normally does,

50
00:05:16.333 --> 00:05:17.895
he should ask himself,
"am I countertransferring?"

51
00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.064
Shut up. You can't even
get an erection, for God s...

52
00:05:21.088 --> 00:05:22.965
I just had one, buddy.

53
00:05:27.262 --> 00:05:30.241
Hair! Hair!

54
00:05:30.265 --> 00:05:31.492
He's biting!

55
00:05:31.516 --> 00:05:33.912
Dan: I got him!

56
00:05:33.936 --> 00:05:37.648
Melinda: Dr. Paige,
thank God you're here.

57
00:05:39.525 --> 00:05:41.711
3 peas in a pod.

58
00:05:41.735 --> 00:05:43.880
Emily, they were fornicating
like a couple of honeymooners.

59
00:05:43.904 --> 00:05:45.174
Dr. Paige, Melinda and I

60
00:05:45.198 --> 00:05:47.051
have worked through our problem.

61
00:05:47.075 --> 00:05:48.302
Shut up. You...

62
00:05:48.326 --> 00:05:50.220
aah! Dr. Paige!

63
00:05:50.244 --> 00:05:51.263
Aah!

64
00:05:51.287 --> 00:05:52.347
It's all right! It's ok! Sorry!

65
00:05:52.371 --> 00:05:53.390
It has a hair trigger. It's ok.

66
00:05:53.414 --> 00:05:55.959
Hey, hey, put the
gun down, Dr. Paige.

67
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.895
Shoot them, Emily.

68
00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:58.020
This is all your fault, Roger!

69
00:05:58.044 --> 00:06:01.631
Everything could've
been so different!

70
00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:04.235
Oh, sorry. Sorry. It's touchy.

71
00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:05.928
It's touchy.

72
00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:09.556
Melinda, come back in here!

73
00:06:13.352 --> 00:06:15.038
Emily, I understand
you're upset.

74
00:06:15.062 --> 00:06:18.500
Sometimes you just
have to let it out.

75
00:06:18.524 --> 00:06:19.626
Just try and let it out.

76
00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.422
Save your
engaging devices, Roger.

77
00:06:23.446 --> 00:06:25.132
No more bullshit!

78
00:06:25.156 --> 00:06:26.634
None!

79
00:06:26.658 --> 00:06:28.177
I've come for us!

80
00:06:28.201 --> 00:06:31.055
Sorry! Sorry.

81
00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:32.474
Over here! Over here!

82
00:06:32.498 --> 00:06:35.584
Hurry! Hurry! Over here!

83
00:06:38.462 --> 00:06:41.149
Hurry! Dr. Paige has a gun.

84
00:06:41.173 --> 00:06:42.776
Who's Dr. Paige?

85
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.444
Our marriage counselor.
She's gonna kill

86
00:06:44.468 --> 00:06:46.530
my husband and Dr. Klink.

87
00:06:46.554 --> 00:06:48.657
Your marriage counselor's
gonna kill your husband?

88
00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:49.658
And Dr. Klink.

89
00:06:49.682 --> 00:06:50.452
Dr. Paige, hi.

90
00:06:50.476 --> 00:06:51.619
Uh, I wanna thank you

91
00:06:51.643 --> 00:06:53.371
for giving Melinda and I the...

92
00:06:53.395 --> 00:06:55.105
the tools to help communicate
and share our feelings.

93
00:06:55.147 --> 00:06:56.582
Shut up! Ok.

94
00:06:56.606 --> 00:06:58.042
Emily, you're very upset.

95
00:06:58.066 --> 00:06:59.502
Sometimes we can feel
as if our lives

96
00:06:59.526 --> 00:07:01.611
are just spiraling
out of control,

97
00:07:01.654 --> 00:07:02.506
just spiraling.

98
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.923
Save your psychobabble

99
00:07:03.947 --> 00:07:05.299
for your little
Doe-eyed patients, Roger.

100
00:07:05.323 --> 00:07:06.342
Ok. Ok, terrific.

101
00:07:06.367 --> 00:07:07.345
You two obviously
have some issues

102
00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:08.387
you need to work through.

103
00:07:08.411 --> 00:07:09.346
Thank God.

104
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.306
No. No. Wait. Move it, klink.

105
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.292
Out of my way!
Mel, it's me! Open up!

106
00:07:16.627 --> 00:07:18.355
Dan: Somebody help me!

107
00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:21.465
Melinda: Don't worry, Danny!

108
00:07:21.966 --> 00:07:23.694
Wow. What do we got, sir?

109
00:07:23.718 --> 00:07:26.531
Hostage situation.
2 therapists.

110
00:07:26.555 --> 00:07:29.284
Domestic or international?

111
00:07:29.308 --> 00:07:31.619
Therapists. Shrinks.

112
00:07:31.643 --> 00:07:32.745
Shrinks?

113
00:07:32.769 --> 00:07:34.455
It's a joke, right?

114
00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:36.499
Some kind of surprise party?

115
00:07:36.523 --> 00:07:38.501
It's not a goddamn party.
It's very serious.

116
00:07:38.526 --> 00:07:40.504
Her marriage counselor's
threatening to kill

117
00:07:40.528 --> 00:07:42.339
her husband and her therapist.

118
00:07:42.363 --> 00:07:45.509
He's not technically
my therapist.

119
00:07:45.533 --> 00:07:48.554
Hey, you're the lady
from those sex tapes.

120
00:07:48.578 --> 00:07:50.139
Sex tapes? What sex tapes?

121
00:07:50.163 --> 00:07:52.123
His hands were under my dress,

122
00:07:52.165 --> 00:07:54.560
firmly holding on to my hips,

123
00:07:54.584 --> 00:07:57.522
moving me back and forth
away from him.

124
00:07:57.546 --> 00:08:00.107
Ok, maybe I better
start at the beginning.

125
00:08:00.131 --> 00:08:02.610
About 2 years ago,
Danny lost his erection.

126
00:08:02.634 --> 00:08:04.571
You gotta see these tapes, sir.

127
00:08:04.595 --> 00:08:06.198
Pretty soon, Danny and me

128
00:08:06.222 --> 00:08:07.574
weren't even talking, and then.

129
00:08:07.598 --> 00:08:09.534
Danny slept with
that cocktail waitress.

130
00:08:09.558 --> 00:08:12.495
I thought he couldn't
get an erection.

131
00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:13.497
So did I. Right.

132
00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:14.790
Our marriage was doomed.

133
00:08:14.814 --> 00:08:17.250
Then I saw Dr. Paige's ad

134
00:08:17.274 --> 00:08:18.294
on a bus bench.

135
00:08:18.318 --> 00:08:19.611
"Save your marriage today."

136
00:08:20.528 --> 00:08:23.281
"Tomorrow will be too late."

137
00:08:23.323 --> 00:08:26.201
Her big deal is honesty.

138
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.435
Honesty first.

139
00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:36.128
The key is honesty.

140
00:08:38.797 --> 00:08:40.692
Marriage is hard.

141
00:08:40.716 --> 00:08:42.611
I know. I've been
married 3 times.

142
00:08:42.635 --> 00:08:44.196
You're divorced?

143
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.740
3 times. That's why I
speak from experience...

144
00:08:45.764 --> 00:08:49.034
what kind of track record is
that for a marriage counselor?

145
00:08:49.058 --> 00:08:50.244
Dan! Dan? What, "Dan"?

146
00:08:50.268 --> 00:08:52.287
Come on. We're taking
marriage advice

147
00:08:52.311 --> 00:08:54.164
from somebody
that's been divorced

148
00:08:54.188 --> 00:08:57.293
and advertises
on bus benches. Wh-what?

149
00:08:57.317 --> 00:08:59.611
Stay with us, Dan.

150
00:09:01.655 --> 00:09:04.116
You know the story

151
00:09:04.158 --> 00:09:06.619
about the guy who goes
to the barbershop.

152
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:09.556
There are 2 barbers,
both available.

153
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.559
One barber has
a terrific haircut.

154
00:09:12.583 --> 00:09:16.313
The other barber's hair
looks just awful.

155
00:09:16.337 --> 00:09:18.524
Which barber would you go to?

156
00:09:18.548 --> 00:09:21.610
You'd go to the barber
with the bad haircut,

157
00:09:21.634 --> 00:09:24.781
not the barber with
the good haircut, see?

158
00:09:24.805 --> 00:09:28.326
The bad haircut cuts
the other one's hair,

159
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:29.452
and vice versa.

160
00:09:29.476 --> 00:09:32.080
That is why it is
actually a plus

161
00:09:32.104 --> 00:09:34.523
that I'm thrice divorced.

162
00:09:38.485 --> 00:09:40.404
Ok.

163
00:09:44.367 --> 00:09:45.511
Let's start over.

164
00:09:45.535 --> 00:09:48.764
What do you want
out of this therapy?

165
00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:50.558
We...

166
00:09:50.582 --> 00:09:52.459
I wanna save our marriage.

167
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.520
Uh, yeah. Me... me, too, yeah.

168
00:09:54.544 --> 00:09:55.646
Great.

169
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:56.773
Now talking about our problems

170
00:09:56.797 --> 00:09:58.441
is the first step.

171
00:09:58.465 --> 00:10:00.234
You can tell me anything,

172
00:10:00.258 --> 00:10:02.111
and hopefully you two can learn

173
00:10:02.135 --> 00:10:05.156
to communicate honestly
with each other.

174
00:10:05.181 --> 00:10:06.616
What's the problem?

175
00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.827
Well, uh...

176
00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:12.206
Danny and me...

177
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:15.417
We haven't been...

178
00:10:15.441 --> 00:10:18.921
Familiar with each other
in a while.

179
00:10:18.945 --> 00:10:20.673
"Familiar"?

180
00:10:20.697 --> 00:10:22.217
Intimate.

181
00:10:22.241 --> 00:10:23.718
No sexual intercourse?

182
00:10:23.742 --> 00:10:24.969
Jesus, lady.

183
00:10:24.993 --> 00:10:26.262
What about oral sex
or mutual masturbation?

184
00:10:26.286 --> 00:10:28.639
Oh, my God, Mel.
Let's get outta here.

185
00:10:28.663 --> 00:10:31.392
We don't need to see
some shrink.

186
00:10:31.416 --> 00:10:33.394
No. I think we do, Dan.

187
00:10:33.418 --> 00:10:34.855
He has a problem with...

188
00:10:34.879 --> 00:10:36.732
don't. Come on. Why?

189
00:10:36.756 --> 00:10:38.799
Mr. Happy.

190
00:10:40.801 --> 00:10:41.820
"Mr. Happy"?

191
00:10:41.844 --> 00:10:42.904
His penis.

192
00:10:42.928 --> 00:10:43.947
My... just say it! Penis!

193
00:10:43.972 --> 00:10:46.658
I can't get my penis
to stand up.

194
00:10:46.682 --> 00:10:48.327
I-I-I'm impotent or something.

195
00:10:48.351 --> 00:10:49.787
I can't wake the baby.

196
00:10:49.811 --> 00:10:51.998
I-I've... I can't get a hard-on!

197
00:10:52.022 --> 00:10:54.709
Is everybody happy now?!
Can we go?

198
00:10:54.733 --> 00:10:56.586
Dan is impotent.

199
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:57.444
Only with me.

200
00:10:57.486 --> 00:10:58.588
That was an accident.

201
00:10:58.612 --> 00:10:59.756
Dan accidentally screwed
that cocktail waitress!

202
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.675
I thought Dan couldn't
get an erection.

203
00:11:02.699 --> 00:11:03.760
So did I.

204
00:11:03.784 --> 00:11:04.803
Well, Melinda's been
so damn depressed

205
00:11:04.827 --> 00:11:05.638
lately, you know?

206
00:11:05.662 --> 00:11:07.264
It's pretty depressing

207
00:11:07.288 --> 00:11:10.500
when you can't excite
your own husband.

208
00:11:12.168 --> 00:11:13.836
Great. We have made
some real progress.

209
00:11:25.015 --> 00:11:28.811
All those in favor,
raise your hands.

210
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.669
Dr. Paige.

211
00:11:35.693 --> 00:11:38.779
You may rejoin the group.

212
00:11:51.084 --> 00:11:53.854
Dr. Paige, it is the duty
of this committee

213
00:11:53.878 --> 00:11:56.774
to defend the integrity
of the psychiatric arts

214
00:11:56.798 --> 00:12:01.071
in the Boise, nampa,
Caldwell tri-city area.

215
00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:03.406
Dr. Paige...

216
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.742
if we allow bus bench
advertising, what's next?

217
00:12:05.766 --> 00:12:08.287
Billboards?

218
00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:08.978
Cable TV?

219
00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:12.333
Following our bylaws

220
00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:13.834
pertaining
to outdoor advertising,

221
00:12:13.859 --> 00:12:17.112
the fine is set at $250.

222
00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.302
Roger!

223
00:12:23.327 --> 00:12:24.387
Huh? Oh.

224
00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:25.621
Hello, Emily.

225
00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:27.682
Sorry about the fine.

226
00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:29.517
Ah, it's only 250 bucks.

227
00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:30.685
I'll write it off. Oh.

228
00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:33.563
Besides, I already got
a couple of clients

229
00:12:33.587 --> 00:12:35.190
from the bus bunch.

230
00:12:35.214 --> 00:12:36.817
It's funny.
I was thinking about you

231
00:12:36.841 --> 00:12:37.860
the other day.

232
00:12:37.884 --> 00:12:39.487
Me? Really?

233
00:12:39.511 --> 00:12:41.447
Are you seeing anyone new?

234
00:12:41.471 --> 00:12:43.949
Oh, I'm s-still married.

235
00:12:43.973 --> 00:12:45.493
I... I meant patients.

236
00:12:45.517 --> 00:12:47.078
Th-there's a woman
I'd like you to see.

237
00:12:47.102 --> 00:12:48.955
She's very, very depressed.

238
00:12:48.979 --> 00:12:51.750
I think her depression
is at the root

239
00:12:51.774 --> 00:12:53.776
of her sexual problems
with her husband.

240
00:12:53.817 --> 00:12:55.754
You could really help her.

241
00:12:55.778 --> 00:12:57.714
I've been scaling back.
I'm not really adding patients.

242
00:12:57.738 --> 00:13:00.091
Well, we talked about
how great it would be

243
00:13:00.115 --> 00:13:01.009
to collaborate sometime,

244
00:13:01.033 --> 00:13:01.950
and this couple's perfect.

245
00:13:01.992 --> 00:13:03.428
Uh, marriage is on the rocks.

246
00:13:03.452 --> 00:13:05.597
I'll take the boy.
You take the girl.

247
00:13:05.621 --> 00:13:06.932
We can confer and strategize,

248
00:13:06.956 --> 00:13:10.435
see if together we can
help save their marriage.

249
00:13:10.459 --> 00:13:12.104
How's your wife?

250
00:13:12.128 --> 00:13:13.814
Ok.

251
00:13:13.838 --> 00:13:15.733
And your husband?

252
00:13:15.757 --> 00:13:17.610
Uh, th-the new one.

253
00:13:17.634 --> 00:13:18.778
He's my new ex.

254
00:13:18.802 --> 00:13:20.655
I moved out last weekend.

255
00:13:20.679 --> 00:13:22.949
Really? Just...

256
00:13:22.973 --> 00:13:23.866
Like that.

257
00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:24.869
Just like that.

258
00:13:24.893 --> 00:13:26.452
It's for the best.

259
00:13:26.476 --> 00:13:27.663
So what do you say?

260
00:13:27.687 --> 00:13:29.772
There's nothing else to say.

261
00:13:29.814 --> 00:13:31.732
Dan's gone off me.

262
00:13:31.857 --> 00:13:34.503
This is a waste of time.

263
00:13:34.527 --> 00:13:36.046
Ok, I feel like we're stuck.

264
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.050
Melinda, I want you
to see a colleague of mine.

265
00:13:39.074 --> 00:13:40.592
You're giving up on me?

266
00:13:40.616 --> 00:13:42.594
I want you to see Dr. Klink.

267
00:13:42.618 --> 00:13:44.806
He's something
of a depression expert

268
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:45.890
from the old school.

269
00:13:45.914 --> 00:13:49.793
What's a depression expert?

270
00:14:06.185 --> 00:14:07.830
What a cliché.

271
00:14:07.854 --> 00:14:10.040
First the affair in Denver.

272
00:14:10.064 --> 00:14:11.667
Then the red corvette.

273
00:14:11.691 --> 00:14:15.504
What's next,
face-lifts and liposuction?

274
00:14:15.528 --> 00:14:17.948
"Desire fades."

275
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.008
Pssh. That's a...

276
00:14:19.032 --> 00:14:21.636
Who is she? Hmm?

277
00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.096
Hmm?

278
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.099
Is it your new receptionist?

279
00:14:26.123 --> 00:14:27.934
You think I need liposuction?

280
00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:31.730
You're not rehashing
Denver, are you?

281
00:14:31.754 --> 00:14:32.856
Are you?

282
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.024
Are you screwing
Dr. Rice again?!

283
00:14:34.048 --> 00:14:36.760
No! There's no one! There w...

284
00:14:38.469 --> 00:14:41.473
We're not happy.

285
00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:44.768
Go to hell, Roger.

286
00:15:29.732 --> 00:15:31.859
Asshole.

287
00:15:33.611 --> 00:15:35.279
Door, please.

288
00:15:45.748 --> 00:15:48.711
Unsafe at any speed.

289
00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:53.149
Oh, the elevator?

290
00:15:53.173 --> 00:15:55.277
No, your corvette.

291
00:15:55.301 --> 00:15:58.887
"Unsafe at any speed."

292
00:16:01.975 --> 00:16:05.979
That's a corvair,
"unsafe at any speed."

293
00:16:08.022 --> 00:16:09.858
It looks just like a corvette.

294
00:16:14.613 --> 00:16:17.217
Funky elevator.

295
00:16:17.241 --> 00:16:19.826
I try not to speak ill of it.
I got stuck once.

296
00:16:19.869 --> 00:16:21.805
By yourself?

297
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:23.807
Yeah.

298
00:16:23.831 --> 00:16:25.225
How boring.

299
00:16:25.249 --> 00:16:26.751
Heh.

300
00:16:27.752 --> 00:16:30.921
Is that why you carry
a change of clothes?

301
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.884
Oh, this. No.

302
00:16:40.766 --> 00:16:44.770
I left my wife just now,
this morning.

303
00:16:48.857 --> 00:16:50.025
You're kidding.

304
00:17:06.042 --> 00:17:07.811
Is this your floor?

305
00:17:07.835 --> 00:17:09.021
Yes.

306
00:17:09.045 --> 00:17:10.273
I'm here to see Dr. Klick.

307
00:17:10.297 --> 00:17:13.734
He's an old-fashioned
depression expert.

308
00:17:13.757 --> 00:17:16.279
You mean Dr. Klink?

309
00:17:16.303 --> 00:17:17.781
Yes.

310
00:17:17.805 --> 00:17:19.157
I'm Dr. Klink.

311
00:17:19.181 --> 00:17:21.284
You're Dr. Klink? Heh.

312
00:17:21.308 --> 00:17:23.787
You're kidding.

313
00:17:23.811 --> 00:17:26.331
I pictured a bald head,
long face, pointy beard.

314
00:17:26.355 --> 00:17:29.024
Who called me old-fashioned?

315
00:17:29.733 --> 00:17:31.360
Dr. Paige.

316
00:17:32.195 --> 00:17:34.739
Y-you mean Emily?

317
00:17:35.824 --> 00:17:40.638
Well, anyway,
I'll see you inside.

318
00:17:40.661 --> 00:17:42.973
Inside and out, I suppose.

319
00:17:42.997 --> 00:17:45.226
On the ins...

320
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.294
ins... in... in my office.

321
00:18:03.103 --> 00:18:05.164
This is my door.

322
00:18:05.187 --> 00:18:06.772
Oh.

323
00:18:07.189 --> 00:18:10.861
Patients go in
that door over there.

324
00:18:15.782 --> 00:18:16.760
Wait.

325
00:18:16.784 --> 00:18:19.346
Your tie's crooked.

326
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:21.889
I guess your wife
didn't check you

327
00:18:21.914 --> 00:18:24.707
before you left the house.

328
00:18:33.385 --> 00:18:35.678
Just go right in.

329
00:18:42.019 --> 00:18:43.412
Tuesday, June 16...

330
00:18:43.436 --> 00:18:44.831
Testing 1, 2.1, 2.

331
00:18:44.854 --> 00:18:46.249
Test... goddamn.

332
00:18:46.273 --> 00:18:48.960
Dr. Klink.

333
00:18:48.983 --> 00:18:49.712
Yes?

334
00:18:49.736 --> 00:18:50.962
Your 9:45 is here.

335
00:18:50.985 --> 00:18:52.839
O... yes. Yes.

336
00:18:52.862 --> 00:18:56.176
Test 1, 2.1, 2.

337
00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.119
Test 1, 2, 3.

338
00:18:59.537 --> 00:19:00.830
Shit.

339
00:19:01.496 --> 00:19:03.934
Sorry. Test 1, 2, 1, 2.

340
00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:04.770
Test...

341
00:19:04.794 --> 00:19:06.335
come in.

342
00:19:13.218 --> 00:19:14.862
It's very cold in here.

343
00:19:14.885 --> 00:19:18.533
Well, you'll need to...

344
00:19:18.557 --> 00:19:19.993
Remember a sweater.

345
00:19:20.016 --> 00:19:21.953
No, no. I meant the decor.

346
00:19:21.977 --> 00:19:25.189
It's... it's so blue.

347
00:19:26.941 --> 00:19:28.919
Alrighty.

348
00:19:28.943 --> 00:19:31.547
Mrs. Carmichael,
would you like to sit here.

349
00:19:31.571 --> 00:19:33.990
Is that where you
want me to sit?

350
00:19:34.031 --> 00:19:37.553
I don't want you to
sit anywhere. I mean...

351
00:19:37.577 --> 00:19:39.180
I see.

352
00:19:39.204 --> 00:19:40.807
What happened
to that friendly man

353
00:19:40.831 --> 00:19:43.083
I met on the elevator?

354
00:19:45.502 --> 00:19:49.149
Look, uh, we had
an inappropriate debut,

355
00:19:49.172 --> 00:19:49.984
but I...

356
00:19:50.008 --> 00:19:51.902
is that what we had?

357
00:19:51.925 --> 00:19:53.927
Yes, we... please.

358
00:20:02.229 --> 00:20:06.000
So, um...

359
00:20:06.024 --> 00:20:07.376
Why are you here?

360
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.587
I'm trying to save my marriage.

361
00:20:09.611 --> 00:20:10.964
Ah.

362
00:20:10.988 --> 00:20:12.548
I've been so depressed lately.

363
00:20:12.571 --> 00:20:14.425
I keep thinking it'll pass,

364
00:20:14.448 --> 00:20:15.510
but it doesn't.

365
00:20:15.534 --> 00:20:16.595
You're a little hangdog
one morning.

366
00:20:16.619 --> 00:20:20.205
Then suddenly you're
on a shrink's lap.

367
00:20:20.623 --> 00:20:21.559
Chair. Heh.

368
00:20:21.583 --> 00:20:24.084
Heh heh heh.

369
00:20:28.631 --> 00:20:30.400
Well, you don't...

370
00:20:30.424 --> 00:20:32.945
Seem very depressed
right this moment.

371
00:20:32.968 --> 00:20:33.988
I'm not.

372
00:20:34.012 --> 00:20:35.448
I was.

373
00:20:35.471 --> 00:20:36.907
I almost didn't get
off the elevator.

374
00:20:36.931 --> 00:20:38.576
It's pretty depressing to think

375
00:20:38.599 --> 00:20:40.870
you need to see
a depression expert.

376
00:20:40.894 --> 00:20:44.480
My marriage expert's
been divorced 3 times.

377
00:20:44.523 --> 00:20:47.002
You must be really depressed.

378
00:20:47.026 --> 00:20:49.194
Let's...

379
00:20:51.155 --> 00:20:57.953
Um, so, w-why don't you, um,
tell me more about you?

380
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:04.585
I'm married to a man who
doesn't get turned on by me.

381
00:21:05.671 --> 00:21:08.005
Ah.

382
00:21:09.006 --> 00:21:10.192
Do you blame me?

383
00:21:10.216 --> 00:21:11.986
Why would I blame you?

384
00:21:12.009 --> 00:21:13.946
Not me. Uh, him.

385
00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:15.907
I... I di... I... I asked
if you blamed your husband.

386
00:21:15.931 --> 00:21:17.951
No, you said, "me."
"Do you blame me?"

387
00:21:17.975 --> 00:21:20.143
No, I di... I... I meant...

388
00:21:22.063 --> 00:21:24.041
Your husband, of course.

389
00:21:24.065 --> 00:21:25.083
Of course.

390
00:21:25.107 --> 00:21:26.334
Dan started sleeping

391
00:21:26.358 --> 00:21:27.628
in the living room on the couch

392
00:21:27.651 --> 00:21:30.005
that's the beginning of the end,

393
00:21:30.028 --> 00:21:31.489
don't you think?

394
00:21:36.203 --> 00:21:39.015
It certainly suggests

395
00:21:39.038 --> 00:21:41.560
a lack of intimacy.

396
00:21:41.584 --> 00:21:45.564
We stopped being intimate
almost 2 years ago.

397
00:21:45.588 --> 00:21:48.024
I shouldn't tell you this.

398
00:21:48.047 --> 00:21:49.108
No, no.

399
00:21:49.133 --> 00:21:51.176
You just... no, no.

400
00:21:52.261 --> 00:21:52.989
Dr. Klink.

401
00:21:53.013 --> 00:21:54.573
No, no, no. I'm s...

402
00:21:54.597 --> 00:21:56.599
please, sit down.

403
00:21:57.141 --> 00:21:59.494
I...

404
00:21:59.518 --> 00:22:02.623
You can tell me anything that...

405
00:22:02.647 --> 00:22:04.399
Really. It's...

406
00:22:10.655 --> 00:22:13.969
One night, I get up
to use the bathroom,

407
00:22:13.993 --> 00:22:15.511
and I looked in on Dan.

408
00:22:15.535 --> 00:22:19.600
He sleeps in his boxers,
and it was a hot night,

409
00:22:19.624 --> 00:22:21.142
and the covers were off,

410
00:22:21.166 --> 00:22:24.396
and so I could see his...

411
00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.213
Mr. Happy.

412
00:22:26.672 --> 00:22:27.942
Mr. Happy?

413
00:22:27.965 --> 00:22:29.151
His thingy.

414
00:22:29.175 --> 00:22:30.402
His pe...

415
00:22:30.426 --> 00:22:32.071
uh, member.

416
00:22:32.094 --> 00:22:33.823
Peeking out.

417
00:22:33.846 --> 00:22:35.575
So I decided to try
a little experiment

418
00:22:35.598 --> 00:22:37.619
to see if Dan was broken

419
00:22:37.643 --> 00:22:40.372
or if he'd just gone off me.

420
00:22:40.396 --> 00:22:41.479
An experiment?

421
00:22:45.651 --> 00:22:48.380
I snuck up...

422
00:22:48.404 --> 00:22:50.590
On my knees,

423
00:22:50.613 --> 00:22:55.638
and with my mouth, I...

424
00:22:55.662 --> 00:22:58.682
Kissed...

425
00:22:58.706 --> 00:23:01.459
Mr. Happy.

426
00:23:04.671 --> 00:23:06.005
Ohh.

427
00:23:07.675 --> 00:23:09.318
But when I tried to make love,

428
00:23:09.342 --> 00:23:11.154
he... his...

429
00:23:11.178 --> 00:23:13.072
It fizzled away

430
00:23:13.096 --> 00:23:15.033
when he woke up and
realized it was me.

431
00:23:15.057 --> 00:23:16.660
Dan's gone off me.

432
00:23:16.684 --> 00:23:19.413
Desire fades.

433
00:23:19.437 --> 00:23:22.166
That... that is
a depressing thought.

434
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:24.317
Yes. It I...

435
00:23:25.651 --> 00:23:28.196
I'm sorry.

436
00:23:28.738 --> 00:23:30.966
I'm sorry.

437
00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.219
I'm in a transitional
phase in my life,

438
00:23:33.243 --> 00:23:34.994
and I...

439
00:23:35.704 --> 00:23:36.722
I'm not taking...

440
00:23:36.746 --> 00:23:38.641
taking on any more patients.

441
00:23:38.664 --> 00:23:40.685
But see, you helped me already.

442
00:23:40.709 --> 00:23:42.729
Really, I can't.

443
00:23:42.753 --> 00:23:44.981
If there were 2 shrinks
in a small town

444
00:23:45.005 --> 00:23:46.650
and one was crazy
and the other sane,

445
00:23:46.673 --> 00:23:50.237
which one would you go to see,
the crazy one or the sane one?

446
00:23:50.261 --> 00:23:51.780
I've never heard of
this one before.

447
00:23:51.803 --> 00:23:53.282
You'd go to the crazy one.

448
00:23:53.305 --> 00:23:54.783
'Cause if there were
only two in the town,

449
00:23:54.806 --> 00:23:57.494
you'd wanna see the one
who helped the other one.

450
00:23:57.518 --> 00:24:00.622
O... you mean if there
were just the two

451
00:24:00.647 --> 00:24:02.625
and they were each... I see.

452
00:24:02.649 --> 00:24:04.043
Dr. Klink,

453
00:24:04.066 --> 00:24:05.795
your 10:30's here.

454
00:24:05.818 --> 00:24:07.589
You hear that?
Do you hear that?

455
00:24:07.613 --> 00:24:09.299
I mean, I...

456
00:24:09.322 --> 00:24:11.676
Would love to just sit...

457
00:24:11.699 --> 00:24:16.639
just to s-sit here
and talk with you...

458
00:24:16.663 --> 00:24:18.290
All afternoon.

459
00:24:21.377 --> 00:24:24.482
But if I run even 5 minutes
over on one session,

460
00:24:24.506 --> 00:24:27.485
my whole week
could be thrown off.

461
00:24:27.509 --> 00:24:29.653
Hell, the rest of my life.

462
00:24:29.677 --> 00:24:31.530
You know...

463
00:24:31.554 --> 00:24:34.743
I'd gladly recommend
to you someone else.

464
00:24:34.767 --> 00:24:38.287
Um, this is a list of qualified

465
00:24:38.311 --> 00:24:42.231
mental health
professionals in Boise.

466
00:25:03.838 --> 00:25:05.840
Meli...

467
00:25:07.258 --> 00:25:09.445
Dr. Klink, what are you doing?

468
00:25:09.469 --> 00:25:11.197
I'm chasing after you.

469
00:25:11.221 --> 00:25:12.448
What about your 10:30?

470
00:25:12.472 --> 00:25:15.141
No, just... I just, uh...

471
00:25:18.313 --> 00:25:20.291
Well, I...

472
00:25:20.315 --> 00:25:22.668
I left my wife, and...

473
00:25:22.692 --> 00:25:26.153
Since you're not my... my patient

474
00:25:26.196 --> 00:25:27.298
and since this...

475
00:25:27.322 --> 00:25:31.302
Well, since this
isn't my office,

476
00:25:31.326 --> 00:25:33.536
I...

477
00:25:50.888 --> 00:25:53.600
It's stuck again.

478
00:25:54.683 --> 00:25:56.204
Mmm. Dr. Klink...

479
00:25:56.228 --> 00:25:57.122
no. Roger.

480
00:25:57.146 --> 00:25:58.456
That was so therapeutic.

481
00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.210
Listen, we... you shouldn't
call me Dr. Klink.

482
00:26:02.234 --> 00:26:05.171
It might give people
the wrong impression.

483
00:26:05.194 --> 00:26:06.590
I... mmm.

484
00:26:06.614 --> 00:26:09.634
But I... I feel so free and open.

485
00:26:09.658 --> 00:26:11.678
I wish Dan had come with me.

486
00:26:11.701 --> 00:26:14.556
I mean, maybe he could
benefit from your expertise.

487
00:26:14.579 --> 00:26:16.766
I don't feel depressed at all!

488
00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:17.727
Hello!

489
00:26:17.751 --> 00:26:19.753
Shh. Don't talk.

490
00:26:22.631 --> 00:26:24.399
Dispatch: Breaker 1-12...

491
00:26:24.423 --> 00:26:26.842
Uh...

492
00:26:27.677 --> 00:26:30.198
Are you folks ok?
You seem flushed

493
00:26:30.221 --> 00:26:31.699
and out of breath. No.

494
00:26:31.722 --> 00:26:33.659
See you next week, Dr. Klink.

495
00:26:33.683 --> 00:26:35.560
Uh, Roger.

496
00:26:37.646 --> 00:26:42.358
I-I'm not actually
her doctor. It's a...

497
00:26:44.654 --> 00:26:47.573
A figure of speech.

498
00:26:52.828 --> 00:26:55.599
Melinda: He's a genius.

499
00:26:55.622 --> 00:26:57.018
His method is so subtle.

500
00:26:57.042 --> 00:26:59.920
It sneaked right up on me.

501
00:27:00.045 --> 00:27:01.856
What did he do, exactly?

502
00:27:01.879 --> 00:27:04.317
He got me to talk.

503
00:27:04.341 --> 00:27:05.652
Sort of.

504
00:27:05.676 --> 00:27:06.968
How many sessions have you had?

505
00:27:07.009 --> 00:27:08.696
Just the one.

506
00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.806
What a man.

507
00:27:11.682 --> 00:27:12.951
He is a genius.

508
00:27:12.975 --> 00:27:15.370
Dan: Hey, uh, hi.

509
00:27:15.393 --> 00:27:17.498
What about my needs?

510
00:27:17.521 --> 00:27:19.648
Am I a part of this
therapy stuff, or what?

511
00:27:24.737 --> 00:27:26.757
"Mas... mastering masturbation"?

512
00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.927
Oh, it's a wonderful guide...

513
00:27:28.951 --> 00:27:30.469
techniques, fantasy games,

514
00:27:30.493 --> 00:27:32.972
lubricants, all in
historical context.

515
00:27:32.996 --> 00:27:36.459
Did you know that Edison
was an avid masturbator?

516
00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.792
It's where he got
his best ideas.

517
00:27:37.835 --> 00:27:40.980
No, e-Edison stole
his best ideas.

518
00:27:41.004 --> 00:27:43.775
Whatever.
Maybe it was Einstein.

519
00:27:43.798 --> 00:27:44.777
Heh heh.

520
00:27:44.801 --> 00:27:46.970
You look fabulous.

521
00:27:54.685 --> 00:27:57.623
Possible dissertation subject...
orgasms and happiness.

522
00:27:57.647 --> 00:28:00.691
Why is it all the world
seems rosy...

523
00:28:02.652 --> 00:28:04.570
It's Dr. Paige,
regarding Melinda.

524
00:28:06.322 --> 00:28:07.634
I'll call her back.

525
00:28:07.658 --> 00:28:09.511
She's on her way in.

526
00:28:09.535 --> 00:28:11.597
You son of a bitch.
I cannot believe

527
00:28:11.621 --> 00:28:13.599
what you did with
Melinda Carmichael.

528
00:28:13.623 --> 00:28:14.766
She told you?

529
00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:17.353
Told me?!
It's all over her face.

530
00:28:17.377 --> 00:28:19.771
I never took any money,
and all I did

531
00:28:19.795 --> 00:28:21.899
was a preliminary interview,
so technically she...

532
00:28:21.923 --> 00:28:25.968
it's absolutely wonderful.

533
00:28:26.637 --> 00:28:28.030
Really?

534
00:28:28.054 --> 00:28:29.449
Now the big challenge
is to somehow

535
00:28:29.472 --> 00:28:30.908
get these 2 people to reconnect

536
00:28:30.932 --> 00:28:32.785
emotionally and sexually.

537
00:28:32.809 --> 00:28:34.371
Can I buy you lunch?

538
00:28:34.395 --> 00:28:36.456
Today? Uh...

539
00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.500
Well, I'm seeing
Mrs. Carmichael.

540
00:28:38.524 --> 00:28:40.794
During lunchtime.

541
00:28:40.818 --> 00:28:42.796
Ohh! Oh, Dr. Klink,

542
00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.798
Roger. Roger.

543
00:28:44.822 --> 00:28:46.884
Call me Roger.

544
00:28:46.908 --> 00:28:48.552
Ohh. Ohh!

545
00:28:48.576 --> 00:28:51.680
Oh! Oh, Dr. Klink!

546
00:28:51.704 --> 00:28:52.931
Ohh! Look!

547
00:28:52.955 --> 00:28:55.625
Ohh! A helicopter.

548
00:29:03.801 --> 00:29:05.111
Wow.

549
00:29:05.135 --> 00:29:09.574
Maybe it was a transplant.

550
00:29:09.598 --> 00:29:10.784
What?

551
00:29:10.808 --> 00:29:12.619
The helicopter...

552
00:29:12.643 --> 00:29:17.124
Was carrying a little
white ice chest

553
00:29:17.148 --> 00:29:19.585
with a red cross on it.

554
00:29:19.609 --> 00:29:21.378
Imagine waking up

555
00:29:21.403 --> 00:29:24.882
with a whole new heart,
Dr. Klink.

556
00:29:24.906 --> 00:29:28.136
Please, call me Roger.

557
00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.722
Ohh. Danny and me used to have

558
00:29:31.746 --> 00:29:33.850
so much in common.

559
00:29:33.874 --> 00:29:36.102
Everything we did together

560
00:29:36.126 --> 00:29:40.106
was making love, not just sex,

561
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:42.609
but cooking together.

562
00:29:42.633 --> 00:29:46.863
And then we took a trip
to salt lake city,

563
00:29:46.887 --> 00:29:51.118
and he was like
my... my big brother

564
00:29:51.142 --> 00:29:52.995
and my friend and...

565
00:29:53.019 --> 00:29:54.747
I... Lover all rolled into...

566
00:29:54.771 --> 00:29:56.583
I don't... ok. We have to talk.

567
00:29:56.607 --> 00:30:01.671
I just... I've gotta listen
to patients all afternoon.

568
00:30:01.695 --> 00:30:04.091
I'm just trying to tell you...

569
00:30:04.115 --> 00:30:06.844
that I felt so good

570
00:30:06.868 --> 00:30:09.179
since last week's session

571
00:30:09.203 --> 00:30:12.057
that I told Danny about us.

572
00:30:12.081 --> 00:30:14.435
You what? Yes.

573
00:30:14.459 --> 00:30:16.812
You... you told your husband
about us?!

574
00:30:16.836 --> 00:30:19.940
Ohh! Oh, my God!

575
00:30:19.964 --> 00:30:22.818
It was amazing and spontaneous,

576
00:30:22.842 --> 00:30:24.904
like we used to be.

577
00:30:24.928 --> 00:30:26.948
What the hell did I do
to deserve this?!

578
00:30:26.972 --> 00:30:28.950
You screwed
that cocktail waitress.

579
00:30:28.974 --> 00:30:32.912
But it wasn't
spontaneous or amazing!

580
00:30:32.936 --> 00:30:33.955
Aah!

581
00:30:33.979 --> 00:30:34.998
You shouldn't have told him.

582
00:30:35.022 --> 00:30:36.666
But you... you talked
about honesty.

583
00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:38.793
No. No, no, no. Dr. Paige
talks about honesty.

584
00:30:38.817 --> 00:30:42.006
I'm still on the fence.
Some lying is good.

585
00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:44.591
You didn't give him the details.

586
00:30:44.615 --> 00:30:46.552
Wow. Elevator sex.

587
00:30:46.576 --> 00:30:50.598
Damn. I've always
admired Melinda's spunk.

588
00:30:50.622 --> 00:30:51.807
Larry!

589
00:30:51.831 --> 00:30:52.999
Now you're even, bro.

590
00:30:53.833 --> 00:30:55.520
How did he take it?

591
00:30:55.544 --> 00:30:56.522
He followed me here.

592
00:30:56.546 --> 00:30:59.173
He what? Shh, shh. Shh, shh.

593
00:31:03.803 --> 00:31:06.764
I don't notice... is... ahh?

594
00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:16.816
Oh, g... je...

595
00:31:17.901 --> 00:31:19.586
Melinda, I...

596
00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:22.823
it's over, you and me. It's...

597
00:31:22.989 --> 00:31:24.842
Dan needs you. He loves you.

598
00:31:24.866 --> 00:31:27.845
He followed you here.
Isn't that romantic?

599
00:31:27.869 --> 00:31:30.056
Listen...

600
00:31:30.081 --> 00:31:32.267
Take what you've gotten
out of our time together.

601
00:31:32.291 --> 00:31:34.793
Focus it back on Dan.

602
00:31:34.836 --> 00:31:35.795
Are you saying that

603
00:31:35.837 --> 00:31:37.940
as my lover or my therapist?

604
00:31:37.964 --> 00:31:40.317
Therapist.

605
00:31:40.341 --> 00:31:42.653
I mean, if I was your therapist,
which I'm not, but...

606
00:31:42.677 --> 00:31:44.905
You know, we have
nothing in common.

607
00:31:44.929 --> 00:31:46.615
This isn't a relationship

608
00:31:46.639 --> 00:31:47.658
based on mutual respect

609
00:31:47.682 --> 00:31:49.077
or understanding
or common interests.

610
00:31:49.101 --> 00:31:52.205
It's based on sex.
That's all. Ahh.

611
00:31:52.229 --> 00:31:53.957
Take it. Uhh.

612
00:31:53.981 --> 00:31:55.750
Oh, my God. We come
from different worlds.

613
00:31:55.774 --> 00:31:57.836
I've got a phd, for God sakes.

614
00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:00.797
You probably barely
graduated from high school.

615
00:32:00.821 --> 00:32:01.840
I have an a.A.

616
00:32:01.864 --> 00:32:03.007
From Boise community college

617
00:32:03.031 --> 00:32:04.843
and a... and a certificate

618
00:32:04.867 --> 00:32:06.511
of physical therapy!

619
00:32:06.535 --> 00:32:08.180
Exactly. The two of you
are more suited.

620
00:32:08.204 --> 00:32:09.974
You're p-perfect
for one anoth...

621
00:32:09.998 --> 00:32:13.769
go home to what's his... Dan.

622
00:32:13.793 --> 00:32:15.629
Mmm!

623
00:32:22.552 --> 00:32:24.530
Divorced?

624
00:32:24.554 --> 00:32:26.574
But you two were
doing much better.

625
00:32:26.598 --> 00:32:29.995
I wish you'd never sent me
to see Dr. Klink.

626
00:32:30.019 --> 00:32:33.749
Mmm. Therapy can
be very intense.

627
00:32:33.773 --> 00:32:34.708
Especially oral therapy.

628
00:32:34.732 --> 00:32:35.627
Dan, don't be crass.

629
00:32:35.651 --> 00:32:36.793
Crass? It's pretty damn crass

630
00:32:36.817 --> 00:32:38.629
without me saying
anything about it.

631
00:32:38.653 --> 00:32:40.922
You had... they had sex
in an elevator.

632
00:32:40.946 --> 00:32:42.758
What? Who did?

633
00:32:42.782 --> 00:32:44.343
Dr. Klink and me.

634
00:32:44.367 --> 00:32:45.928
You slept with Dr. Klink
in an elevator?

635
00:32:45.952 --> 00:32:47.346
Oh, yeah, they slept.

636
00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:48.789
Like a couple of dogs
in heat, they slept.

637
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:50.683
You're disgusting!
At least I didn't have to

638
00:32:50.707 --> 00:32:52.852
bend over backwards
to get him aroused.

639
00:32:52.876 --> 00:32:55.772
Oh, I thought that's
exactly what you did do

640
00:32:55.796 --> 00:32:57.732
bastard!
I wanted this to work out.

641
00:32:57.756 --> 00:33:00.568
Was the elevator
your idea or his?

642
00:33:00.592 --> 00:33:01.945
Dan: Does it matter?

643
00:33:01.969 --> 00:33:02.696
Heh.

644
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.322
You son of a bitch!

645
00:33:04.346 --> 00:33:07.618
In the elevator.
In the elevator.

646
00:33:07.642 --> 00:33:08.620
Emily, it just happened.

647
00:33:08.644 --> 00:33:10.829
She wasn't technically
my patient.

648
00:33:10.853 --> 00:33:12.290
Oh, save it for the board!

649
00:33:12.314 --> 00:33:13.832
You didn't tell the board.

650
00:33:13.856 --> 00:33:16.818
Of course I told the board.

651
00:33:16.984 --> 00:33:18.879
This is outrageous!

652
00:33:18.904 --> 00:33:20.799
Kindly keep your voice down.

653
00:33:20.823 --> 00:33:23.677
The amount is regulated
by the bylaws.

654
00:33:23.701 --> 00:33:28.264
Specifically number 47
calls for fines of up to $25

655
00:33:28.288 --> 00:33:29.308
for inappropriate behavior.

656
00:33:29.332 --> 00:33:30.850
Inappropriate behavior?!

657
00:33:30.874 --> 00:33:32.352
He was having sex
with his patient

658
00:33:32.376 --> 00:33:34.313
in an elevator.

659
00:33:34.337 --> 00:33:36.297
Ah. She wasn't
technically his patient.

660
00:33:36.339 --> 00:33:38.192
The minute she walked
into his office,

661
00:33:38.216 --> 00:33:39.234
she was his patient.

662
00:33:39.258 --> 00:33:40.277
No, no. Technically she was

663
00:33:40.301 --> 00:33:41.779
your patient, Dr. Paige.

664
00:33:41.803 --> 00:33:42.947
My patient?!

665
00:33:42.971 --> 00:33:44.114
I think the fine is fair.

666
00:33:44.138 --> 00:33:45.866
I was fined 250 bucks

667
00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:46.992
for advertising on a bus bench.

668
00:33:47.016 --> 00:33:50.663
He's fined $25 for
screwing in an elevator.

669
00:33:50.687 --> 00:33:53.249
Byline 17 is very specific

670
00:33:53.273 --> 00:33:54.417
with regards to

671
00:33:54.441 --> 00:33:55.626
permissible outdoor advertising.

672
00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:57.670
A hooker costs more than that.

673
00:33:57.695 --> 00:33:59.047
Dr. Paige, that's enough.

674
00:33:59.071 --> 00:34:01.174
It is more than enough.

675
00:34:01.198 --> 00:34:03.301
Who should I make
the check out to?

676
00:34:03.325 --> 00:34:04.553
You hurt me, Roger.

677
00:34:04.577 --> 00:34:05.803
All you had to do was call me.

678
00:34:05.828 --> 00:34:07.139
Why didn't you just call me?

679
00:34:07.163 --> 00:34:08.289
I'm sorry, Emily.

680
00:34:08.331 --> 00:34:10.041
You will be.

681
00:34:14.838 --> 00:34:16.131
Heh.

682
00:34:18.884 --> 00:34:20.318
I really am sorry, Emily.

683
00:34:20.343 --> 00:34:21.904
Let bygones be bygones?

684
00:34:21.928 --> 00:34:23.472
Listen, Buster.
You're not off the hook.

685
00:34:23.514 --> 00:34:26.475
You're going down.
You will lose everything...

686
00:34:26.517 --> 00:34:28.912
money, your license.

687
00:34:28.936 --> 00:34:31.330
By the time this is over,
you will never practice again.

688
00:34:31.355 --> 00:34:33.332
What are you gonna do?

689
00:34:33.357 --> 00:34:34.335
Nosta.

690
00:34:34.359 --> 00:34:36.277
Nosta.

691
00:34:41.073 --> 00:34:43.910
What the heck is a nosta?

692
00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:47.806
The national organization
to stop therapist abuse.

693
00:34:47.831 --> 00:34:48.974
National? I don't know

694
00:34:48.999 --> 00:34:51.435
if this is
the right thing to do.

695
00:34:51.459 --> 00:34:53.146
I really just want Danny back.

696
00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:56.149
We need to teach
Dr. Klink a lesson.

697
00:34:56.173 --> 00:34:56.941
Danny.

698
00:34:56.965 --> 00:34:57.902
Hi, Mel.

699
00:34:57.925 --> 00:34:59.528
Ok, let me do all the talking.

700
00:34:59.552 --> 00:35:03.448
Wait, what law school was it
you said you went to?

701
00:35:03.472 --> 00:35:04.365
Careful, toots.

702
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:05.285
You're the one who sent

703
00:35:05.308 --> 00:35:06.576
my vulnerable sister-in-law

704
00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.869
into the arms of
that Dr. Krink.

705
00:35:07.894 --> 00:35:10.121
It's klink, Larry, and shut up!

706
00:35:10.146 --> 00:35:11.957
You should have talked to me

707
00:35:11.981 --> 00:35:13.918
before you called anyone.

708
00:35:13.942 --> 00:35:15.920
We're gonna nail
that son of a bitch.

709
00:35:15.944 --> 00:35:17.404
There she is.

710
00:35:18.447 --> 00:35:19.840
Consuela Ann barker, esquire,

711
00:35:19.864 --> 00:35:21.551
of barker, barker,
beacons & Bauer,

712
00:35:21.575 --> 00:35:23.469
who represent nosta.

713
00:35:23.493 --> 00:35:25.430
I'm the second barker.
You can call me Connie.

714
00:35:25.454 --> 00:35:26.932
You must be the victim.

715
00:35:26.956 --> 00:35:29.100
Lawrence p. Carmichael,
esquire, a.B.D.

716
00:35:29.124 --> 00:35:30.893
I'll be handling
all negotiations.

717
00:35:30.918 --> 00:35:32.770
We'll hear your proposal.

718
00:35:32.795 --> 00:35:34.606
Let me remind you you are

719
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:36.442
the very first national
abuse group we've contacted,

720
00:35:36.466 --> 00:35:38.945
so we're looking for
a competitive preemptive figure

721
00:35:38.969 --> 00:35:42.239
which will act as a deterrent
to other advocacy groups

722
00:35:42.263 --> 00:35:45.242
which we may be inclined to go.

723
00:35:45.266 --> 00:35:46.184
To.

724
00:35:48.562 --> 00:35:50.206
All but degree. My client...

725
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:51.499
take a powder, Lawrence.

726
00:35:51.523 --> 00:35:53.292
This is a serious situation.

727
00:35:53.317 --> 00:35:55.111
You are way out of your league.

728
00:35:56.737 --> 00:35:57.922
Take your pet monkey with you.

729
00:35:57.947 --> 00:35:58.549
Just a second.

730
00:35:58.573 --> 00:36:00.217
That's my husband.

731
00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:01.926
I need to speak
to you privately,

732
00:36:01.951 --> 00:36:03.553
without the peanut gallery.

733
00:36:03.578 --> 00:36:05.138
Connie: It's precisely
these gray-zone cases

734
00:36:05.162 --> 00:36:06.223
that we must win.

735
00:36:06.247 --> 00:36:07.932
We need to send a message,

736
00:36:07.957 --> 00:36:08.933
a strong message.

737
00:36:08.958 --> 00:36:09.959
We'll have to prove the doctor

738
00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:11.229
took advantage
of your fragile ego

739
00:36:11.253 --> 00:36:12.271
and lured you into

740
00:36:12.295 --> 00:36:14.439
psychosexual emotional bondage.

741
00:36:14.464 --> 00:36:15.690
Psycho what?

742
00:36:15.715 --> 00:36:16.942
He is a master manipulator.

743
00:36:16.967 --> 00:36:18.987
It is that quiet,
lost puppy quality.

744
00:36:19.011 --> 00:36:21.280
I felt an attraction
for Dr. Klink.

745
00:36:21.304 --> 00:36:23.449
Transference refers
to strong feelings

746
00:36:23.474 --> 00:36:24.534
that the patient... you...

747
00:36:24.558 --> 00:36:26.201
erroneously transfers
to a therapist...

748
00:36:26.227 --> 00:36:28.372
Dr. Klink... but which
in fact originated

749
00:36:28.396 --> 00:36:29.830
out of earlier relationships.

750
00:36:29.855 --> 00:36:32.275
You mean like with
my husband, maybe?

751
00:36:34.861 --> 00:36:38.907
Perhaps an even earlier
relationship.

752
00:36:41.117 --> 00:36:42.344
Ahh. Hot.

753
00:36:42.369 --> 00:36:43.453
Melinda, where did this

754
00:36:43.495 --> 00:36:44.846
immoral congress transpire?

755
00:36:44.871 --> 00:36:45.599
Immoral congress?

756
00:36:45.623 --> 00:36:46.932
In a goddamn elevator.

757
00:36:46.956 --> 00:36:47.934
Elevator sex. Whew.

758
00:36:47.958 --> 00:36:49.101
And in his office.

759
00:36:49.126 --> 00:36:50.102
On his couch?

760
00:36:50.127 --> 00:36:51.021
And on the desk.

761
00:36:51.045 --> 00:36:51.981
Mmm. And why did you go

762
00:36:52.005 --> 00:36:53.398
to Dr. Klink
in the first place?

763
00:36:53.422 --> 00:36:55.942
Dr. Paige sent me to him.

764
00:36:55.966 --> 00:36:58.511
She said he would take care
of me the old-fashioned way.

765
00:36:59.136 --> 00:37:02.949
He's... he's a specialist,
a depression expert.

766
00:37:02.973 --> 00:37:04.951
We met at a communication
conference, and...

767
00:37:04.975 --> 00:37:07.038
we'll get it all
in the deposition.

768
00:37:07.062 --> 00:37:07.622
My deposition?

769
00:37:07.646 --> 00:37:08.956
You're a key witness.

770
00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:11.624
Ok, let's, uh, skip
the elevator for now.

771
00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:13.443
Take me through
this couch coupling.

772
00:37:13.484 --> 00:37:16.338
Well, it's... it's
a little embarrassing.

773
00:37:16.362 --> 00:37:18.925
Um, we started on the desk.

774
00:37:18.949 --> 00:37:21.093
Have you ever heard
the name ezri stovall?

775
00:37:21.118 --> 00:37:24.932
He is the malpractice
insurance go-to guy

776
00:37:24.956 --> 00:37:26.765
in this region.

777
00:37:26.791 --> 00:37:28.601
He rarely loses, never settles.

778
00:37:28.625 --> 00:37:31.270
He will be ruthless.

779
00:37:31.295 --> 00:37:33.106
Now, I know this is difficult,

780
00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:35.400
but it's important
that you recall

781
00:37:35.425 --> 00:37:37.195
the exact details

782
00:37:37.219 --> 00:37:38.987
and specific sequence of events.

783
00:37:39.011 --> 00:37:41.991
Well, um, it's a little hazy,

784
00:37:42.015 --> 00:37:44.910
but I know he, Dr. Klink,

785
00:37:44.935 --> 00:37:45.913
went down on me.

786
00:37:45.937 --> 00:37:47.246
Cunnilingus. You ok?

787
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:48.914
What else did he do?

788
00:37:48.939 --> 00:37:50.273
I went down on him.

789
00:37:50.315 --> 00:37:51.250
Fellatio!

790
00:37:51.274 --> 00:37:52.275
You know, I don't think

791
00:37:52.317 --> 00:37:54.379
we wanna play
this oral sex card.

792
00:37:54.403 --> 00:37:56.297
It's illegal in this state.

793
00:37:56.322 --> 00:37:57.091
It is?

794
00:37:57.115 --> 00:37:58.093
It's sodomy.

795
00:37:58.116 --> 00:37:59.843
Oral sex is sodomy?

796
00:37:59.867 --> 00:38:01.636
"To carnally know any
male or female person

797
00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.179
by the anus or mouth."

798
00:38:03.204 --> 00:38:04.473
It's a class-a misdemeanor.

799
00:38:04.497 --> 00:38:06.182
I don't wanna hurt Dr. Klink.

800
00:38:06.207 --> 00:38:08.102
I just wanted
to save my marriage.

801
00:38:08.126 --> 00:38:09.979
Being with Dr. Klink
made me realize

802
00:38:10.003 --> 00:38:12.482
how much Danny and me
have in common.

803
00:38:12.506 --> 00:38:14.316
We will crush Dr. Klink.

804
00:38:14.341 --> 00:38:18.029
Look at you.
My God, just look at you.

805
00:38:18.053 --> 00:38:19.196
Dr. Paige is right.

806
00:38:19.221 --> 00:38:20.948
You poor, pathetic woman.

807
00:38:20.973 --> 00:38:23.100
He's destroyed you.

808
00:38:27.355 --> 00:38:28.374
Nice shot.

809
00:38:28.398 --> 00:38:30.483
Hey. Hi.

810
00:38:31.317 --> 00:38:32.295
Mind if I sit?

811
00:38:32.319 --> 00:38:35.321
It's a free bar. Heh heh.

812
00:38:36.614 --> 00:38:38.591
That lady lawyer
thinks a divorce

813
00:38:38.616 --> 00:38:40.594
would be great for our case.

814
00:38:40.619 --> 00:38:43.139
I don't want a divorce, Mel.

815
00:38:43.163 --> 00:38:44.598
No?

816
00:38:44.623 --> 00:38:47.351
No.

817
00:38:47.376 --> 00:38:50.104
I... I just want you
to stop seeing him.

818
00:38:50.129 --> 00:38:52.274
I'm not seeing him.

819
00:38:52.298 --> 00:38:55.527
So you don't want to split up?

820
00:38:55.551 --> 00:38:57.320
No. No, not at all.

821
00:38:57.344 --> 00:38:58.530
We can't split up, Mel.

822
00:38:58.554 --> 00:39:01.616
You and I, we're like...
we're like a team.

823
00:39:01.641 --> 00:39:04.953
Siegfried & Roy,
hall & oates, ham and cheese.

824
00:39:04.977 --> 00:39:06.621
I'm sorry I strayed,

825
00:39:06.646 --> 00:39:08.748
but you kind of opened the door.

826
00:39:08.773 --> 00:39:11.126
I wanted to talk
to you about that.

827
00:39:11.151 --> 00:39:12.087
The truth is, Mel, I...

828
00:39:12.111 --> 00:39:13.421
shh. Let's not talk about it.

829
00:39:13.445 --> 00:39:17.157
Water down the drain, Dan.
Water down the drain.

830
00:39:26.542 --> 00:39:28.062
Hey, how's that divorce coming?

831
00:39:28.086 --> 00:39:31.022
Uh, please, counsel,
let's not lose sight

832
00:39:31.047 --> 00:39:34.275
of the human element
in this tragedy.

833
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:36.778
You know, a divorce
would really help our case.

834
00:39:36.803 --> 00:39:39.615
I'm working on it.

835
00:39:39.639 --> 00:39:41.099
This is Joel Johnson Jr.

836
00:39:41.141 --> 00:39:43.328
He's with beerquist,
angsthall & Cox.

837
00:39:43.352 --> 00:39:46.730
Joel is our point man here in...

838
00:39:48.107 --> 00:39:49.084
Boise.

839
00:39:49.108 --> 00:39:50.086
Boise.

840
00:39:50.109 --> 00:39:51.377
Boise.

841
00:39:51.401 --> 00:39:52.670
Joel's come up with a figure.

842
00:39:52.695 --> 00:39:56.699
How much money were
you hoping to see?

843
00:40:04.707 --> 00:40:07.269
$30,000.

844
00:40:07.293 --> 00:40:08.771
Heh. Million.

845
00:40:08.795 --> 00:40:11.733
It's $30 million.

846
00:40:11.757 --> 00:40:13.401
$30 million?

847
00:40:13.425 --> 00:40:14.652
$30 million?

848
00:40:14.676 --> 00:40:16.613
You've hit the jackpot, Melinda.

849
00:40:16.637 --> 00:40:18.197
Whoo-hoo! Yeah.

850
00:40:18.222 --> 00:40:20.699
Dr. Klink doesn't
have $30 million.

851
00:40:20.724 --> 00:40:23.161
No, Dr. Klink has
malpractice insurance,

852
00:40:23.185 --> 00:40:25.204
and they've got $30 million.

853
00:40:25.229 --> 00:40:26.956
Emily: Dear God.

854
00:40:26.981 --> 00:40:28.708
I had no idea
it would be so much.

855
00:40:28.733 --> 00:40:31.586
There's not a better person
she could have screwed.

856
00:40:31.611 --> 00:40:32.671
Except her priest.

857
00:40:32.695 --> 00:40:33.756
Catholics pay
a shitload of money

858
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:35.465
to keep this kind of crap down.

859
00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:37.510
I'm gonna get $30 million

860
00:40:37.534 --> 00:40:39.619
for having sex with Dr. Klink?

861
00:40:39.661 --> 00:40:40.620
In an elevator.

862
00:40:40.662 --> 00:40:41.789
And on his desk.

863
00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:43.182
$30 million.

864
00:40:43.206 --> 00:40:45.184
Minus 30% contingency,

865
00:40:45.208 --> 00:40:47.437
50% if we win on appeal.

866
00:40:47.461 --> 00:40:49.689
How much more do you think

867
00:40:49.713 --> 00:40:51.799
a divorce might net?

868
00:41:05.689 --> 00:41:08.625
Why the hell are you suing me?

869
00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:09.835
Um...

870
00:41:09.859 --> 00:41:12.629
Because...

871
00:41:12.654 --> 00:41:15.675
You took advantage
of my fragile ego

872
00:41:15.699 --> 00:41:18.260
and got me in a psychoemotional,

873
00:41:18.285 --> 00:41:19.846
sexual thing.

874
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:21.013
What?

875
00:41:21.038 --> 00:41:22.139
Why don't you
take a walk, klink,

876
00:41:22.164 --> 00:41:23.434
before I call the cops.

877
00:41:23.458 --> 00:41:24.685
Oh, if it isn't
the erectionless wonder,

878
00:41:24.709 --> 00:41:26.562
Mr. Happy!

879
00:41:26.586 --> 00:41:28.189
You told him about Mr. Happy?

880
00:41:28.213 --> 00:41:30.732
Dr. Klink, I told
you that in therapy.

881
00:41:30.756 --> 00:41:32.985
First of all, it's Roger.

882
00:41:33.009 --> 00:41:35.278
Secondly, it wasn't therapy.
You were never my patient.

883
00:41:35.303 --> 00:41:38.807
Why don't you tell it
to the judge, Mr. Majestic?

884
00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:41.744
You told him
about Mr. Majestic?

885
00:41:41.768 --> 00:41:42.663
Dan is my husband.

886
00:41:42.687 --> 00:41:44.663
I tell him everything.

887
00:41:44.688 --> 00:41:46.665
Are you screwing yet?

888
00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:48.667
There's more to our
relationship than sex.

889
00:41:48.692 --> 00:41:50.712
There better be
with Mr. Limpy here.

890
00:41:50.736 --> 00:41:52.630
You son of a...

891
00:41:52.655 --> 00:41:54.741
Unh! Danny!

892
00:41:55.491 --> 00:41:57.970
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

893
00:41:57.994 --> 00:41:58.971
Come on.

894
00:41:58.995 --> 00:41:59.889
Come on.

895
00:41:59.913 --> 00:42:01.931
I hope you fight better than...

896
00:42:01.956 --> 00:42:03.791
aah! Aah!

897
00:42:04.667 --> 00:42:06.436
Let go! No.

898
00:42:06.461 --> 00:42:08.731
Come on, honey. Come on.

899
00:42:08.756 --> 00:42:11.275
Why'd you have to
tell him about Mr. Happy?

900
00:42:11.299 --> 00:42:12.652
It's ok. He's a doctor.

901
00:42:12.676 --> 00:42:14.445
Don't sue me, Melinda.

902
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:16.280
I'll lose my license.
It's all I have.

903
00:42:16.304 --> 00:42:19.243
I'm sorry. Good-bye, Dr. Klink.

904
00:42:19.267 --> 00:42:20.785
Come on. Roger.

905
00:42:20.809 --> 00:42:22.853
Call me Roger.

906
00:42:25.857 --> 00:42:31.738
Ezri stovall will
crush her like a bug.

907
00:42:35.492 --> 00:42:37.344
We've gotta nip this kind

908
00:42:37.369 --> 00:42:39.930
of frivolous litigation
in the bud.

909
00:42:39.954 --> 00:42:41.892
People have to start

910
00:42:41.916 --> 00:42:43.851
taking responsibility
for their actions.

911
00:42:43.876 --> 00:42:45.795
Why'd you stop
sleeping together?

912
00:42:45.836 --> 00:42:47.855
Makes it seem like

913
00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:49.924
you thought you were
doing something wrong.

914
00:42:50.049 --> 00:42:51.902
It was an absolute taboo.

915
00:42:51.926 --> 00:42:53.803
A therapist can never
have sex with a patient.

916
00:42:53.844 --> 00:42:55.697
The moment you two screwed,

917
00:42:55.721 --> 00:42:57.783
she became your lover,

918
00:42:57.807 --> 00:43:00.411
thereby making it impossible

919
00:43:00.435 --> 00:43:03.790
for her to ever be your patient.

920
00:43:03.814 --> 00:43:04.792
Where'd you bone her?

921
00:43:04.815 --> 00:43:06.918
We made love in an elevator.

922
00:43:06.942 --> 00:43:08.877
Elevator sex. I... pssh.

923
00:43:08.902 --> 00:43:11.423
You're kidding me.

924
00:43:11.447 --> 00:43:13.882
I'm in elevators all the time.

925
00:43:13.907 --> 00:43:16.594
I know. I'm sorry.

926
00:43:16.618 --> 00:43:18.931
How long would something
like that take?

927
00:43:18.955 --> 00:43:20.790
It was over pretty quickly.

928
00:43:20.832 --> 00:43:22.016
Mechanical failure?

929
00:43:22.041 --> 00:43:24.293
Oh, no. She hit the stop.

930
00:43:24.335 --> 00:43:27.690
Or, uh, m-maybe I did.

931
00:43:27.714 --> 00:43:30.443
Is this really important?

932
00:43:30.467 --> 00:43:32.736
Every detail is important.

933
00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.637
You need booze?

934
00:43:35.055 --> 00:43:36.699
Juries are fickle.

935
00:43:36.723 --> 00:43:38.408
Something could
come out at the trial,

936
00:43:38.433 --> 00:43:41.580
and you'll be screwed.

937
00:43:41.604 --> 00:43:42.706
Any witnesses?

938
00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:43.998
Other passengers?

939
00:43:44.022 --> 00:43:45.291
No, of c... no, of course not.

940
00:43:45.316 --> 00:43:46.792
How about a surveillance camera?

941
00:43:46.817 --> 00:43:48.753
Oh, Jesus.

942
00:43:48.777 --> 00:43:52.757
Well, there may not be one
if the elevator's old enough.

943
00:43:52.781 --> 00:43:54.509
Please, God.

944
00:43:54.533 --> 00:43:58.830
Ok, so, you're ballin' her.

945
00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:01.016
Did you ejaculate?

946
00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.853
W... uh, is there any way not to?

947
00:44:03.877 --> 00:44:06.755
Not that I've found.

948
00:44:08.548 --> 00:44:11.903
Did she mention any other
therapists she's slept with?

949
00:44:11.927 --> 00:44:14.740
Other members
of the hippocratic arts?

950
00:44:14.764 --> 00:44:17.868
Orthodontists? Podiatrists?

951
00:44:17.892 --> 00:44:19.370
Clergy?

952
00:44:19.394 --> 00:44:20.912
I don't know. I don't think so.

953
00:44:20.936 --> 00:44:22.789
What about you?

954
00:44:22.813 --> 00:44:24.957
How many other
nonpatient patients

955
00:44:24.982 --> 00:44:26.543
have you banged? None.

956
00:44:26.567 --> 00:44:28.086
You banging your receptionist?

957
00:44:28.111 --> 00:44:29.797
Tiff... no.

958
00:44:29.821 --> 00:44:33.825
Well, let ezri stovall
get to work.

959
00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.393
Clammy.

960
00:44:41.417 --> 00:44:42.751
Heh heh heh heh heh heh.

961
00:44:46.505 --> 00:44:49.008
Don't answer it, baby.

962
00:44:53.012 --> 00:44:54.972
Oh.

963
00:44:56.808 --> 00:44:57.744
Hello.

964
00:44:57.768 --> 00:44:58.911
Helen, ezri.

965
00:44:58.935 --> 00:45:00.454
Hi. What's up?

966
00:45:00.478 --> 00:45:02.873
I've got something
for you. You free?

967
00:45:02.898 --> 00:45:04.708
Available. Never free.

968
00:45:04.733 --> 00:45:07.527
Ha ha!
Never give it away, baby.

969
00:45:08.737 --> 00:45:09.964
Is that that sumbitch stovall?

970
00:45:09.988 --> 00:45:11.466
She's spoken for!

971
00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:13.133
Shh. This is business.

972
00:45:13.158 --> 00:45:14.136
Ahh. Ahh.

973
00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.886
I'm defending a headshrinker

974
00:45:15.911 --> 00:45:18.807
who put his pecker
where he shouldn't have.

975
00:45:18.831 --> 00:45:20.809
And she's suing him.

976
00:45:20.834 --> 00:45:21.750
Bingo.

977
00:45:22.794 --> 00:45:24.771
D-don't get it, baby.

978
00:45:24.796 --> 00:45:25.649
Please. Hold on.

979
00:45:25.673 --> 00:45:27.774
We haven't worked in a month.

980
00:45:27.799 --> 00:45:29.150
I can't... I'm gonna...

981
00:45:29.175 --> 00:45:30.885
Oww! Oh.

982
00:45:36.891 --> 00:45:37.828
Hello.

983
00:45:37.852 --> 00:45:39.454
Is Felix Potter in?

984
00:45:39.478 --> 00:45:41.832
He sure is.

985
00:45:41.856 --> 00:45:44.900
Ahh. Goddamn.

986
00:45:46.736 --> 00:45:47.672
Yeah, hello.

987
00:45:47.696 --> 00:45:48.880
Felix Potter. Uh-huh.

988
00:45:48.904 --> 00:45:50.114
Connie barker out of Chicago.

989
00:45:50.156 --> 00:45:50.966
Joel Johnson of

990
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.843
beerquist, angsthall & Cox

991
00:45:51.866 --> 00:45:53.176
gave me your number. Uh-huh.

992
00:45:53.201 --> 00:45:55.471
I'm looking for
a private investigator.

993
00:45:55.495 --> 00:45:56.805
I'm representing the victim

994
00:45:56.830 --> 00:45:58.766
in a therapist abuse case.

995
00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:00.308
What do you got, ezri?

996
00:46:00.333 --> 00:46:01.853
I need to find out if
there's anything in his past

997
00:46:01.877 --> 00:46:04.481
that might hurt us.
We're just starting depositions.

998
00:46:04.505 --> 00:46:05.689
Ahh. Ahh.

999
00:46:05.714 --> 00:46:06.899
Ezri and Connie:
What's the matter?

1000
00:46:06.923 --> 00:46:07.776
Nothing. Nothing.

1001
00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.527
Radio.

1002
00:46:09.551 --> 00:46:11.279
Connie: His name
is klink, Roger klink.

1003
00:46:11.303 --> 00:46:12.990
She's Melinda Carmichael.
The shrink is Roger klink.

1004
00:46:13.014 --> 00:46:13.950
Dr. Klink? Yep.

1005
00:46:13.974 --> 00:46:15.117
What's her name?

1006
00:46:15.141 --> 00:46:16.284
Connie and Helen:
Melinda Carmichael.

1007
00:46:16.308 --> 00:46:17.451
We're on the same case.

1008
00:46:17.476 --> 00:46:18.828
Ezri: You'll get
your usual fee, Helen.

1009
00:46:18.853 --> 00:46:21.123
I'd like to put you
on a retainer, Felix.

1010
00:46:21.147 --> 00:46:23.751
I need some dirt on Dr. Klink.

1011
00:46:23.775 --> 00:46:24.877
Uh-huh.

1012
00:46:24.901 --> 00:46:26.003
Fax me everything you got.

1013
00:46:26.027 --> 00:46:26.963
Uh-huh. Ok, ezri?

1014
00:46:26.987 --> 00:46:28.631
I gotta go. I'm there.

1015
00:46:28.655 --> 00:46:32.802
Interesting.
50 bucks an hour, plus expenses.

1016
00:46:32.826 --> 00:46:34.763
Fax me at this number.

1017
00:46:34.787 --> 00:46:36.765
Fax me. Fax...

1018
00:46:36.789 --> 00:46:39.667
ahh!

1019
00:46:40.918 --> 00:46:43.854
We're working
the same job again.

1020
00:46:43.879 --> 00:46:48.509
You show me yours,
I'll show you mine.

1021
00:46:50.804 --> 00:46:53.073
Ezri: Have you ever had
your deposition

1022
00:46:53.097 --> 00:46:54.909
taken before, Mrs. Carmichael?

1023
00:46:54.933 --> 00:46:55.767
No.

1024
00:46:55.809 --> 00:46:56.911
Do you understand

1025
00:46:56.935 --> 00:46:58.913
that your testimony here today

1026
00:46:58.937 --> 00:47:00.039
is given under oath

1027
00:47:00.063 --> 00:47:02.499
and done just like in court?

1028
00:47:02.524 --> 00:47:05.795
So despite the informal setting,

1029
00:47:05.819 --> 00:47:07.047
you are testifying

1030
00:47:07.071 --> 00:47:11.116
under penalty of perjury.

1031
00:47:12.743 --> 00:47:13.721
I'm sorry. The tape jammed.

1032
00:47:13.745 --> 00:47:16.872
I'll need a minute.

1033
00:47:18.249 --> 00:47:21.252
It's his first day.

1034
00:47:25.841 --> 00:47:28.777
Is he gonna be here every day?

1035
00:47:28.802 --> 00:47:31.096
It's his right.

1036
00:47:33.974 --> 00:47:35.726
Videographer: Got it.

1037
00:47:36.643 --> 00:47:37.995
Now, Mrs. Carmichael,

1038
00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:39.747
were you carnally intimate

1039
00:47:39.771 --> 00:47:40.749
with Roger klink?

1040
00:47:40.773 --> 00:47:42.709
Carnally intimate?

1041
00:47:42.733 --> 00:47:43.836
Sexually intimate.

1042
00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:46.589
Melinda: Um, I guess so.

1043
00:47:46.613 --> 00:47:49.216
I mean, we had sex.

1044
00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:52.845
Would you please describe
in specific detail

1045
00:47:52.869 --> 00:47:53.847
the first of these

1046
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:55.639
decorous unions
with Roger klink?

1047
00:47:55.663 --> 00:47:57.850
Indecorous unions, counsel.

1048
00:47:57.874 --> 00:48:00.019
Consenting adults
engaged in fornication...

1049
00:48:00.043 --> 00:48:02.647
what could be
more decorous, counsel?

1050
00:48:02.671 --> 00:48:05.816
How about if, for the purposes
of this deposition,

1051
00:48:05.841 --> 00:48:08.528
we let the noun stand alone,
unqualified?

1052
00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:11.114
Union, plain and simple.

1053
00:48:11.139 --> 00:48:12.448
Fine.

1054
00:48:12.473 --> 00:48:13.783
Mrs. Carmichael,
would you please

1055
00:48:13.807 --> 00:48:18.079
walk me through
this initial union?

1056
00:48:18.104 --> 00:48:19.455
What?

1057
00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:20.832
Mr. Stovall would
like you to describe

1058
00:48:20.857 --> 00:48:23.276
your first encounter
with Dr. Klink.

1059
00:48:23.317 --> 00:48:25.086
Roger klink.

1060
00:48:25.111 --> 00:48:26.838
He is a doctor, counsel.

1061
00:48:26.863 --> 00:48:30.092
Yes, counsel,
but not her doctor.

1062
00:48:30.117 --> 00:48:31.427
How about if,

1063
00:48:31.451 --> 00:48:32.762
for the purposes
of this deposition,

1064
00:48:32.786 --> 00:48:37.017
we let the klink stand
alone, unqualified?

1065
00:48:37.041 --> 00:48:38.959
Fine.

1066
00:48:40.795 --> 00:48:41.813
Mrs. Carmichael,

1067
00:48:41.837 --> 00:48:44.965
when you're ready.

1068
00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:49.655
Well, we had, um...

1069
00:48:49.679 --> 00:48:54.285
Sex in the elevator
of his building

1070
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:56.603
between floors.

1071
00:48:56.645 --> 00:49:00.207
And would you describe
this union as standard?

1072
00:49:00.231 --> 00:49:01.834
What are you
getting at, counsel?

1073
00:49:01.858 --> 00:49:03.752
I'm trying to establish the mode

1074
00:49:03.777 --> 00:49:05.629
by which they carnally
expressed themselves.

1075
00:49:05.654 --> 00:49:08.883
Oh, you mean the way in which
they were carnally expressive.

1076
00:49:08.908 --> 00:49:09.760
Precisely.

1077
00:49:09.784 --> 00:49:12.011
Missionary? Front door?

1078
00:49:12.036 --> 00:49:14.347
Back door?

1079
00:49:14.371 --> 00:49:16.641
Roundy-round?
Were you prostrate?

1080
00:49:16.666 --> 00:49:17.726
Plumb?

1081
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:18.728
Ingénue?

1082
00:49:18.752 --> 00:49:20.270
Cou...

1083
00:49:20.295 --> 00:49:21.771
well, he, um...

1084
00:49:21.796 --> 00:49:23.066
He, um...

1085
00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:25.484
Stopped the elevator,

1086
00:49:25.508 --> 00:49:27.903
and we just kind of
moved at each other.

1087
00:49:27.928 --> 00:49:28.762
Uh...

1088
00:49:28.804 --> 00:49:30.740
Did he stop the elevator,

1089
00:49:30.764 --> 00:49:32.325
or did you?

1090
00:49:32.349 --> 00:49:35.035
One of us did.
I-it's a little hazy.

1091
00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:38.289
Ok, but you made the first move.

1092
00:49:38.314 --> 00:49:39.874
You're leading
the plaintiff, counsel.

1093
00:49:39.898 --> 00:49:43.087
We both moved at the same time,

1094
00:49:43.111 --> 00:49:45.947
grabbed at each other. Doct...

1095
00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:53.246
he was very excited.

1096
00:49:54.205 --> 00:49:56.892
Klink told you he was excited?

1097
00:49:56.916 --> 00:49:57.811
No.

1098
00:49:57.835 --> 00:50:00.938
But... but I could feel his...

1099
00:50:00.963 --> 00:50:02.899
Well, his...

1100
00:50:02.923 --> 00:50:06.068
Mr. Happy was pressing up
against me.

1101
00:50:06.093 --> 00:50:07.319
Mr. Happy?

1102
00:50:07.344 --> 00:50:11.181
Well, that's what
my husband calls his...

1103
00:50:12.057 --> 00:50:13.494
Johnson.

1104
00:50:13.518 --> 00:50:15.311
Yes, counsel?

1105
00:50:17.397 --> 00:50:18.375
Not you.

1106
00:50:18.398 --> 00:50:20.752
I'm, uh, referring to.

1107
00:50:20.776 --> 00:50:23.420
Melinda's husband's Johnson.

1108
00:50:23.444 --> 00:50:26.007
Klink's Johnson...
klink's penis.

1109
00:50:26.031 --> 00:50:27.090
Could we stay focused

1110
00:50:27.115 --> 00:50:30.201
on klink's penis
and not the husband's?

1111
00:50:30.911 --> 00:50:32.930
Uh, Mrs. Carmichael,

1112
00:50:32.954 --> 00:50:35.249
perhaps there's another
term we could use

1113
00:50:35.291 --> 00:50:38.961
to describe Roger klink's penis.

1114
00:50:41.255 --> 00:50:44.842
Mr. Majestic.
That's what he calls it.

1115
00:50:45.802 --> 00:50:48.863
Why didn't you tell me
your pecker has a name?

1116
00:50:48.888 --> 00:50:49.989
Ehh... and that she knows it?

1117
00:50:50.014 --> 00:50:52.367
I didn't think
it would come up, so...

1118
00:50:52.392 --> 00:50:54.369
ohh!

1119
00:50:54.394 --> 00:50:56.271
I, uh...

1120
00:50:57.898 --> 00:51:00.334
Had an affair 3 years ago.

1121
00:51:00.358 --> 00:51:03.463
I mean, it was
a doctor in Denver.

1122
00:51:03.487 --> 00:51:05.173
It was a seminal relationship.

1123
00:51:05.197 --> 00:51:06.841
If I hadn't had the affair,
I never would've

1124
00:51:06.865 --> 00:51:08.427
bought the corvette
or left my wife.

1125
00:51:08.451 --> 00:51:09.885
Are you still seeing him?

1126
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:11.430
Him? No.

1127
00:51:11.454 --> 00:51:12.973
It was a... a her.
Uh, she, doctor.

1128
00:51:12.997 --> 00:51:15.100
Oh, right.

1129
00:51:15.124 --> 00:51:17.210
It doesn't have any bearing
on this case.

1130
00:51:17.586 --> 00:51:21.297
It better not.

1131
00:51:24.634 --> 00:51:26.821
Back on the record, please.

1132
00:51:26.845 --> 00:51:29.991
Ok, so you could
feel Dr. Majestic.

1133
00:51:30.015 --> 00:51:33.244
I think it's
Mr. Majestic, counsel.

1134
00:51:33.268 --> 00:51:38.459
Right. Uh, you could
feel Mr. Majestic

1135
00:51:38.483 --> 00:51:40.918
pressing up against you.

1136
00:51:40.943 --> 00:51:43.921
What happened next?

1137
00:51:43.946 --> 00:51:46.968
Um, we started kissing
and grabbing,

1138
00:51:46.992 --> 00:51:54.182
and he was bumping himself
up against me,

1139
00:51:54.207 --> 00:51:58.230
kissing my neck, and...

1140
00:51:58.254 --> 00:52:02.191
He slid his hands
under my blouse

1141
00:52:02.216 --> 00:52:07.405
and was caressing
my breasts in circles,

1142
00:52:07.429 --> 00:52:10.182
tiny, little circles.

1143
00:52:12.602 --> 00:52:14.997
And one thing led to another,

1144
00:52:15.021 --> 00:52:18.126
and I just...

1145
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:23.446
Took Mr. Majestic, um...

1146
00:52:26.909 --> 00:52:28.035
In my mouth.

1147
00:52:30.203 --> 00:52:31.931
Ehh.

1148
00:52:31.955 --> 00:52:33.933
Both: You son of a bitch!

1149
00:52:33.957 --> 00:52:35.351
Dan: Aah!

1150
00:52:35.376 --> 00:52:36.602
Whaah!

1151
00:52:36.627 --> 00:52:37.480
Dr. Paige!

1152
00:52:37.504 --> 00:52:40.399
Danny! Danny! Danny, stop!

1153
00:52:40.423 --> 00:52:43.609
You son of a bitch!
How dare you?!

1154
00:52:43.635 --> 00:52:45.344
How dare you?!

1155
00:52:46.721 --> 00:52:48.073
Melinda: Dr. Klink, are you ok?

1156
00:52:48.097 --> 00:52:49.866
Emily: You son of a bitch!

1157
00:52:49.891 --> 00:52:50.992
Ok, I'm all right.
I'm all right.

1158
00:52:51.017 --> 00:52:53.103
I'm all right.
I'm all right now.

1159
00:52:53.145 --> 00:52:54.438
Out! Out! Out!

1160
00:52:54.479 --> 00:52:56.498
I'm sorry.

1161
00:52:56.523 --> 00:52:58.919
Ahh!

1162
00:52:58.943 --> 00:53:01.296
You pathetic,
immature peckerwoods!

1163
00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:03.965
Oh, the hilarity.

1164
00:53:03.989 --> 00:53:06.634
She kissed his pee-pee.

1165
00:53:06.659 --> 00:53:09.596
Grow up!

1166
00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:13.350
This is serious
goddamn business!

1167
00:53:13.374 --> 00:53:14.977
Salacious, yes.

1168
00:53:15.001 --> 00:53:16.603
Scandalous, of course.

1169
00:53:16.627 --> 00:53:17.896
Titillating, possibly.

1170
00:53:17.921 --> 00:53:19.941
But my client's career hangs on.

1171
00:53:19.965 --> 00:53:23.611
Ms. Barker's client's
most intimate testimonial.

1172
00:53:23.635 --> 00:53:25.654
Get out and stay out

1173
00:53:25.679 --> 00:53:28.282
until it's time
for your depositions!

1174
00:53:28.307 --> 00:53:29.951
My... why would I need to do one?

1175
00:53:29.975 --> 00:53:32.036
Because you're
the flaccid bastard

1176
00:53:32.061 --> 00:53:33.913
that started this whole mess.

1177
00:53:33.938 --> 00:53:34.914
Now beat it!

1178
00:53:34.939 --> 00:53:35.667
He's... that's...

1179
00:53:35.691 --> 00:53:37.541
ditto! Amscray!

1180
00:53:37.567 --> 00:53:39.443
I'm... I'm going.

1181
00:53:43.698 --> 00:53:47.010
Beautifully expressed, counsel.

1182
00:53:47.035 --> 00:53:49.121
Oh, yeah.

1183
00:53:56.128 --> 00:53:57.396
That shit's hot.

1184
00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:59.189
Shut up, Larry!

1185
00:53:59.214 --> 00:54:00.984
You're not looking
at the big picture.

1186
00:54:01.008 --> 00:54:02.402
The 3, zero, zero

1187
00:54:02.426 --> 00:54:05.571
zero, zero, zero,
zero, zero dollar picture.

1188
00:54:05.596 --> 00:54:07.532
Enough. Enough! Give it a rest.

1189
00:54:07.556 --> 00:54:10.935
Give it a rest,
Larry, ok, please?

1190
00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:14.581
This is all your fault.

1191
00:54:14.606 --> 00:54:15.916
My fault?

1192
00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:17.293
You're the one that sent...

1193
00:54:17.317 --> 00:54:18.628
you're the one that sent my wife

1194
00:54:18.652 --> 00:54:20.045
to that sex fiend.

1195
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:21.463
I'll catch you
later, bro. I, uh...

1196
00:54:21.488 --> 00:54:23.258
I... I forgot something.

1197
00:54:23.282 --> 00:54:25.051
Well, maybe if you'd been
able to deliver the goods,

1198
00:54:25.075 --> 00:54:27.219
your wife wouldn't
have been so damn horny

1199
00:54:27.244 --> 00:54:28.846
that she threw herself

1200
00:54:28.871 --> 00:54:30.472
on Dr. Klink
in a goddamn elevator!

1201
00:54:30.497 --> 00:54:31.683
Fuck you, Dr. Paige!

1202
00:54:31.707 --> 00:54:33.601
Fuck me.

1203
00:54:33.626 --> 00:54:35.586
How you gonna do that, Dan,
with Dr. Klink's help?

1204
00:54:36.712 --> 00:54:38.274
No.

1205
00:54:38.298 --> 00:54:39.982
Heh.

1206
00:54:40.008 --> 00:54:41.652
Hey, we came to you guys
'cause we wanted help.

1207
00:54:41.676 --> 00:54:43.070
We wanted to save our marriage.

1208
00:54:43.094 --> 00:54:44.696
You guys are supposed
to be professionals.

1209
00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:46.264
You guys don't know anything!

1210
00:54:46.306 --> 00:54:47.741
You wanna know why

1211
00:54:47.766 --> 00:54:49.201
you can't get an erection
with Melinda?

1212
00:54:49.225 --> 00:54:50.994
Hey. Hey, not so loud.

1213
00:54:51.019 --> 00:54:52.079
No protection, no erection.

1214
00:54:52.103 --> 00:54:54.582
No diaphragm,
Mr. Happy gets sad.

1215
00:54:54.606 --> 00:54:57.085
Wife wants children.
Husband doesn't.

1216
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:58.336
Wife forces the issue.

1217
00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:02.090
It is a classic
Venus and Mars dynamic.

1218
00:55:02.114 --> 00:55:03.967
Now, generally we like patients

1219
00:55:03.991 --> 00:55:06.679
to come to certain conclusions
on their own.

1220
00:55:06.703 --> 00:55:10.098
But what the hell? There it is,

1221
00:55:10.122 --> 00:55:11.266
free of charge.

1222
00:55:11.291 --> 00:55:12.435
I'm not ready to be a father.

1223
00:55:12.459 --> 00:55:13.768
Great! And what
does Melinda say?

1224
00:55:13.793 --> 00:55:15.688
We don't ever talk about it.

1225
00:55:15.712 --> 00:55:17.606
We use birth control.
What is there to say?

1226
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:18.691
Isn't that what marriage is,

1227
00:55:18.715 --> 00:55:20.568
you know, uh,
knowing without saying?

1228
00:55:20.592 --> 00:55:21.736
Fantasyland, Dan.

1229
00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:26.240
All relationships
are killed by dishonesty,

1230
00:55:26.264 --> 00:55:30.161
repressed feelings,
things left unsaid.

1231
00:55:30.186 --> 00:55:32.663
Honesty first.

1232
00:55:32.688 --> 00:55:34.415
"No protection, no erection."

1233
00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.418
You're good.

1234
00:55:35.442 --> 00:55:37.318
I'm the best.

1235
00:55:38.611 --> 00:55:40.505
No protection, no erection.

1236
00:55:40.529 --> 00:55:42.257
Mm-hmm, yeah.

1237
00:55:42.281 --> 00:55:45.118
Back on the record, please.

1238
00:55:45.494 --> 00:55:47.513
I'm trying to picture this.

1239
00:55:47.537 --> 00:55:48.723
Y-you were kneeling?

1240
00:55:48.747 --> 00:55:51.642
No. I was standing up,

1241
00:55:51.666 --> 00:55:57.381
bent over, with him in my mouth.

1242
00:55:58.132 --> 00:56:01.528
So, he was
a passive participant?

1243
00:56:01.552 --> 00:56:03.070
No.

1244
00:56:03.095 --> 00:56:05.741
His hand was under my skirt,

1245
00:56:05.765 --> 00:56:09.120
and he started to touch me...

1246
00:56:09.144 --> 00:56:11.687
Rub my...

1247
00:56:12.105 --> 00:56:15.066
Mrs. Happy.

1248
00:56:15.358 --> 00:56:18.170
Yes, and, um, let's see.

1249
00:56:18.194 --> 00:56:19.713
With his other hand,

1250
00:56:19.738 --> 00:56:23.217
he was still
touching my breast...

1251
00:56:23.242 --> 00:56:24.636
Very gently,

1252
00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:29.748
slowly tracing tiny
circles around my nipple,

1253
00:56:29.791 --> 00:56:33.210
around and around...

1254
00:56:33.586 --> 00:56:36.355
Around and around

1255
00:56:36.381 --> 00:56:39.443
and up and down on Mrs. Happy.

1256
00:56:39.467 --> 00:56:42.612
Up and down...

1257
00:56:42.637 --> 00:56:46.141
And around and around.

1258
00:56:51.104 --> 00:56:52.372
Off the record a second.

1259
00:56:52.397 --> 00:56:55.335
Uh, counsel, excuse me.
Would you mind...

1260
00:56:55.359 --> 00:56:57.653
Would you object
to a 10-minute recess?

1261
00:56:59.738 --> 00:57:01.865
Quite the contrary, counsel.

1262
00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:19.819
I'm just trying
to tell the truth.

1263
00:57:19.843 --> 00:57:21.863
You're making it sound

1264
00:57:21.887 --> 00:57:23.865
like you had wonderful sex
with a terrific lover.

1265
00:57:23.889 --> 00:57:26.326
We're trying to sue him,
remember?

1266
00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:29.479
We're not writing
an erotic novel.

1267
00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:33.774
That circle stuff sounded great.

1268
00:57:38.989 --> 00:57:42.993
Where'd you come up with
that circle business?

1269
00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:45.638
Circle business?

1270
00:57:45.662 --> 00:57:47.706
Around her nipple?

Heh.

1279
00:58:23.702 --> 00:58:25.639
Excuse me. Heh heh.

1280
00:58:25.663 --> 00:58:28.392
Nice... nice camerawork. Here.

1281
00:58:28.416 --> 00:58:31.603
I thought they
kicked you out of here.

1282
00:58:31.627 --> 00:58:33.898
"Lawrence Carmichael, esq."

1283
00:58:33.922 --> 00:58:35.691
It's esquire.

1284
00:58:35.715 --> 00:58:36.776
Attorney.

1285
00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:38.426
You're a lawyer?

1286
00:58:39.803 --> 00:58:42.448
How would you kids like to earn

1287
00:58:42.472 --> 00:58:45.910
a little extra scratch
on the side?

1288
00:58:45.934 --> 00:58:47.937
Scratch?

1289
00:59:00.825 --> 00:59:03.262
Time sort of stood still.

1290
00:59:03.286 --> 00:59:06.974
I remember becoming
aware of pounding

1291
00:59:06.998 --> 00:59:09.727
and people's voices...

1292
00:59:09.751 --> 00:59:10.770
Hello!

1293
00:59:10.794 --> 00:59:13.064
And then the phone
started to ring,

1294
00:59:13.088 --> 00:59:14.941
And that's when

1295
00:59:14.965 --> 00:59:16.984
he, uh...

1296
00:59:17.008 --> 00:59:19.737
Put his, uh...

1297
00:59:19.761 --> 00:59:21.573
Mr. Majestic.

1298
00:59:21.597 --> 00:59:24.076
Into my...

1299
00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:25.078
Mrs. Happy.

1300
00:59:25.102 --> 00:59:26.936
And there was this pounding

1301
00:59:26.978 --> 00:59:29.372
and shouting and ringing,

1302
00:59:29.396 --> 00:59:31.584
and we got into
this amazing rhythm.

1303
00:59:31.608 --> 00:59:34.295
It was all over
in about a minute,

1304
00:59:34.319 --> 00:59:37.071
minute and a half.

1305
00:59:38.781 --> 00:59:41.427
Did klink arrive at emission?

1306
00:59:41.451 --> 00:59:42.346
Yes.

1307
00:59:42.370 --> 00:59:43.888
I wasn't using any protection,

1308
00:59:43.912 --> 00:59:46.474
so at the last minute,
we pulled apart,

1309
00:59:46.498 --> 00:59:48.935
and I finished him with my hand.

1310
00:59:48.959 --> 00:59:50.437
You did?

1311
00:59:50.461 --> 00:59:51.938
Yes, and the other time, too.

1312
00:59:51.962 --> 00:59:53.547
Really?

1313
00:59:55.591 --> 00:59:59.779
Off the record for a second.

1314
00:59:59.803 --> 01:00:02.825
Is it hot in here, counsel?

1315
01:00:02.849 --> 01:00:03.827
Mm-hmm-hmm.

1316
01:00:03.851 --> 01:00:05.327
It's almost 11:00.

1317
01:00:05.351 --> 01:00:06.829
Uh, I'd like to break
early for lunch.

1318
01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:08.789
This is the first day
of deposition.

1319
01:00:08.813 --> 01:00:12.585
Given the exhaustive nature
of today's testimony, I...

1320
01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:15.088
perhaps a discontinuation...

1321
01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:17.090
Is counsel requesting a recess?

1322
01:00:17.114 --> 01:00:20.927
What would counsel's inclination
be to such a request?

1323
01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:23.120
R-request granted.

1324
01:00:45.727 --> 01:00:47.771
Uh...

1325
01:00:50.942 --> 01:00:53.837
Does counsel have
plans for lunch?

1326
01:00:53.861 --> 01:00:58.616
Counsel's going back
to the hotel for a cold shower.

1327
01:01:01.118 --> 01:01:03.472
Howdy, ezri.

1328
01:01:03.496 --> 01:01:04.890
Howdy, partner.

1329
01:01:04.914 --> 01:01:06.749
How are you?

1330
01:01:16.844 --> 01:01:17.761
Oh.

1331
01:01:27.897 --> 01:01:30.918
Heh.

1332
01:01:30.942 --> 01:01:33.987
You've got a great memory
for details.

1333
01:01:36.906 --> 01:01:39.784
It's like being
on truth serum in there.

1334
01:01:39.826 --> 01:01:42.579
Everything comes flooding out.

1335
01:01:45.791 --> 01:01:47.769
Melinda, why are you suing me?

1336
01:01:47.793 --> 01:01:51.607
It's... this is so humiliating
for both of us,

1337
01:01:51.631 --> 01:01:53.775
and if it goes to trial, this...

1338
01:01:53.799 --> 01:01:57.779
everyone in Boise
will find out about...

1339
01:01:57.803 --> 01:01:59.156
It.

1340
01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:00.532
I think I'm gonna drop the suit.

1341
01:02:00.556 --> 01:02:01.951
I don't wanna go
any further with it.

1342
01:02:01.975 --> 01:02:03.035
What? R-really?

1343
01:02:03.059 --> 01:02:07.456
No. Uh, y-you should get...

1344
01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:10.066
Something.

1345
01:02:11.485 --> 01:02:14.988
Do you love me, Dr. Klink?

1346
01:02:15.781 --> 01:02:17.634
S...

1347
01:02:17.658 --> 01:02:19.845
Do I love you?

1348
01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:20.763
Yes.

1349
01:02:20.788 --> 01:02:22.955
Do you love me?

1350
01:02:25.124 --> 01:02:27.209
I could love you.

1351
01:02:28.002 --> 01:02:29.879
Could?

1352
01:02:31.964 --> 01:02:33.776
Thanks, ezri.

1353
01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:35.635
Get that bite looked at.

1354
01:02:36.636 --> 01:02:38.990
What is it with you
and elevators?

1355
01:02:39.014 --> 01:02:40.033
You know, it's...

1356
01:02:40.057 --> 01:02:41.575
take the goddamn stairs.

1357
01:02:41.599 --> 01:02:44.203
I wanted to talk to you.

1358
01:02:44.227 --> 01:02:46.831
You know, maybe we could...
I mean, I was thinking we...

1359
01:02:46.855 --> 01:02:51.944
I... I really wanna settle
out of court, if...

1360
01:02:52.861 --> 01:02:54.048
Aah! Eesh.

1361
01:02:54.072 --> 01:02:56.258
Let me set you straight.

1362
01:02:56.282 --> 01:02:59.887
First, ezri stovall
has never settled.

1363
01:02:59.911 --> 01:03:00.971
Well, that's fine...

1364
01:03:00.995 --> 01:03:03.766
he either wins...

1365
01:03:03.790 --> 01:03:08.104
Or he goes down
kicking and biting.

1366
01:03:08.128 --> 01:03:10.565
2...

1367
01:03:10.589 --> 01:03:13.026
2! Ezri stovall makes
the recommendation

1368
01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:14.485
to the insurance company

1369
01:03:14.509 --> 01:03:17.155
to go to court,
to settle, et cetera.

1370
01:03:17.179 --> 01:03:19.765
If you don't heed his advice,

1371
01:03:19.807 --> 01:03:21.934
you will be settling
on your own,

1372
01:03:21.976 --> 01:03:24.270
without the insurance company.

1373
01:03:26.063 --> 01:03:30.110
Uh, I have
malpractice insurance.

1374
01:03:30.861 --> 01:03:31.820
Ehh.

1375
01:03:32.946 --> 01:03:35.174
Fine print, elevator boy.

1376
01:03:35.198 --> 01:03:38.886
Your policy guarantees
you a defense.

1377
01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:42.932
It doesn't say it'll
pay out if you lose

1378
01:03:42.956 --> 01:03:48.771
or if it finds that you
have acted criminally...

1379
01:03:48.796 --> 01:03:50.941
Criminally? I never
acted criminally.

1380
01:03:50.965 --> 01:03:51.860
Or unethically...

1381
01:03:51.884 --> 01:03:54.319
She wasn't even my patient.

1382
01:03:54.343 --> 01:03:56.763
Or if you decide to...
and I quote...

1383
01:03:56.804 --> 01:03:58.782
"if you decide to act against

1384
01:03:58.806 --> 01:04:02.935
insurance carrier's
appointed counsel."

1385
01:04:03.895 --> 01:04:06.815
You mean if I settle, I pay?

1386
01:04:07.565 --> 01:04:08.776
Yep.

1387
01:04:08.817 --> 01:04:11.779
Dan: Hey, Mel.

1388
01:04:11.945 --> 01:04:13.548
Hey, hey, uh...

1389
01:04:13.572 --> 01:04:15.908
I got you some arby's.

1390
01:04:17.826 --> 01:04:20.097
Thanks.

1391
01:04:20.121 --> 01:04:21.765
Hey.

1392
01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:23.582
Ok.

1393
01:04:32.342 --> 01:04:33.260
I've been thinking, Mel.

1394
01:04:33.302 --> 01:04:35.011
I know what our problem was.

1395
01:04:35.053 --> 01:04:36.763
Me, too. You cheated with
that cocktail waitress.

1396
01:04:36.805 --> 01:04:37.907
I didn't cheat with the co...

1397
01:04:37.931 --> 01:04:39.784
I mean, I was gonna,
but I didn't.

1398
01:04:39.808 --> 01:04:41.744
You lied to me about
sleeping with her.

1399
01:04:41.769 --> 01:04:42.913
You and I weren't exactly...

1400
01:04:42.937 --> 01:04:44.497
because you couldn't...

1401
01:04:44.521 --> 01:04:46.082
I couldn't because you
wanted a baby, all right?

1402
01:04:46.106 --> 01:04:48.126
Dr. Paige spelled it
all out for me.

1403
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:49.169
No protection, no erection.

1404
01:04:49.193 --> 01:04:50.587
I just wasn't ready yet,

1405
01:04:50.611 --> 01:04:52.047
but hell, if you
really want a baby,

1406
01:04:52.071 --> 01:04:53.590
we'll have one. I don't care,

1407
01:04:53.614 --> 01:04:55.342
especially with the
money we got coming in.

1408
01:04:55.366 --> 01:04:57.929
I don't wanna
make a baby, not yet.

1409
01:04:57.953 --> 01:04:59.221
Yeah, you do. No, I don't.

1410
01:04:59.245 --> 01:05:01.724
Yes, you do. Dr. Paige
said it was classic

1411
01:05:01.748 --> 01:05:02.749
the way you lost your diaphragm.

1412
01:05:02.791 --> 01:05:04.268
Well, she's wrong.
I didn't lose it.

1413
01:05:04.292 --> 01:05:08.064
I just didn't use it, because
you wanted me to get pregnant.

1414
01:05:08.088 --> 01:05:09.982
I wanted you to get pregnant?

1415
01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:10.943
Yes. No, you... no, wait.

1416
01:05:10.967 --> 01:05:12.944
You wanted to get pregnant.

1417
01:05:12.968 --> 01:05:14.947
No way. I am not ready
to have a baby.

1418
01:05:14.971 --> 01:05:16.114
You're not. Uh-uh.

1419
01:05:16.138 --> 01:05:17.240
That means together
we're both not ready.

1420
01:05:17.264 --> 01:05:18.909
You don't understand.
This is awesome!

1421
01:05:18.933 --> 01:05:20.994
Oh, my God, I thought
if I even mentioned

1422
01:05:21.018 --> 01:05:22.996
that I didn't want to have kids,

1423
01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:24.081
you'd divorce me.

1424
01:05:24.105 --> 01:05:24.958
Really? Yeah.

1425
01:05:24.982 --> 01:05:26.375
Me, too. Oh, my God.

1426
01:05:26.399 --> 01:05:27.876
Honesty first. That's the key.

1427
01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:30.254
I feel like
a weight's been lifted.

1428
01:05:30.278 --> 01:05:32.340
That Dr. Paige is a genius.

1429
01:05:32.364 --> 01:05:33.757
I love you, Mel.

1430
01:05:33.781 --> 01:05:35.802
I love you, Danny.

1431
01:05:35.826 --> 01:05:37.804
I missed you holding me
and holding my hand

1432
01:05:37.828 --> 01:05:38.930
and touching my back.

1433
01:05:38.954 --> 01:05:40.247
This is what I wanted all along.

1434
01:05:40.288 --> 01:05:43.184
Me, too. Oh, we could
do this every day if we want.

1435
01:05:43.208 --> 01:05:46.230
We could do this all day,
every day, whenever we want.

1436
01:05:46.254 --> 01:05:48.023
With the money we got coming in,

1437
01:05:48.047 --> 01:05:49.399
we could do whatever we want.

1438
01:05:49.423 --> 01:05:50.943
You should see the... the things.

1439
01:05:50.967 --> 01:05:52.152
Larry has lined up...
the brochures,

1440
01:05:52.176 --> 01:05:55.239
the... the telemarketing,
uh, opportunities.

1441
01:05:55.263 --> 01:05:56.949
The... the real estate invest...

1442
01:05:56.973 --> 01:05:57.951
there's fun stuff, too...

1443
01:05:57.975 --> 01:05:59.494
jai alai and, you know, boxing.

1444
01:05:59.518 --> 01:06:00.995
What's Larry have to do
with any of this?

1445
01:06:01.019 --> 01:06:02.747
Well, he's our...
he works for us.

1446
01:06:02.771 --> 01:06:03.956
You know, he quit his job.

1447
01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:05.250
Larry's never had a job.

1448
01:06:05.274 --> 01:06:07.460
No, he has one now,
'cause he works for us.

1449
01:06:07.484 --> 01:06:09.087
He's gonna get 10%
of whatever we win.

1450
01:06:09.111 --> 01:06:11.464
This isn't a jackpot, Dan.
This is our life.

1451
01:06:11.488 --> 01:06:13.049
Look, I was stupid before, ok?

1452
01:06:13.073 --> 01:06:14.843
I was really dumb.
You go in there.

1453
01:06:14.867 --> 01:06:16.387
You say whatever
you have to say.

1454
01:06:16.411 --> 01:06:17.971
It's just words to me now, baby.

1455
01:06:17.995 --> 01:06:19.890
I don't even care...
where you going?

1456
01:06:19.914 --> 01:06:22.101
I want out!
I want it all to go away...

1457
01:06:22.125 --> 01:06:24.103
the doctors and
the lawyers and you!

1458
01:06:24.127 --> 01:06:26.230
Me?! What did I do?

1459
01:06:26.254 --> 01:06:27.899
I don't like you, Danny!

1460
01:06:27.923 --> 01:06:30.067
You're a big, bad devil!

1461
01:06:30.091 --> 01:06:33.429
What? What'd I do?

1462
01:06:39.851 --> 01:06:41.329
Connie: No! No!

1463
01:06:41.353 --> 01:06:44.249
Ohh! You wanna
drop the lawsuit?!

1464
01:06:44.273 --> 01:06:46.251
Yes. It's not worth it.

1465
01:06:46.275 --> 01:06:48.837
I never liked this case
to begin with.

1466
01:06:48.861 --> 01:06:51.256
Oh, this one looked
better on paper.

1467
01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:52.990
Mmm.

1468
01:06:58.871 --> 01:07:00.433
Fine.

1469
01:07:00.457 --> 01:07:02.060
Fine. Just write us
a check for all

1470
01:07:02.084 --> 01:07:03.227
our out-of-pocket legal fees.

1471
01:07:03.251 --> 01:07:05.563
Fine. How much will that be?

1472
01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:08.650
Joel: Well, let's see.

1473
01:07:08.674 --> 01:07:11.778
We have Ms. Barker's fees,
plus expenses and per diem,

1474
01:07:11.802 --> 01:07:13.112
times 10 days,

1475
01:07:13.136 --> 01:07:15.407
plus first-class airfare

1476
01:07:15.431 --> 01:07:17.076
and her support staff
in Chicago.

1477
01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:21.121
Then of course there's me
and my staff here in Boise,

1478
01:07:21.145 --> 01:07:24.291
plus one private detective
at $50 an hour,

1479
01:07:24.315 --> 01:07:26.919
plus xeroxing, postage,

1480
01:07:26.943 --> 01:07:29.839
various office expenses.

1481
01:07:29.863 --> 01:07:32.133
Comes to just under $75,000.

1482
01:07:32.157 --> 01:07:35.303
$75,000?

1483
01:07:35.327 --> 01:07:36.804
Just under.

1484
01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:40.141
I don't have that kind of money.

1485
01:07:40.165 --> 01:07:43.002
Guess we'll stay the course.

1486
01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:49.134
Never forget
you're the victim here.

1487
01:07:59.603 --> 01:08:01.271
Hmm.

1488
01:08:03.106 --> 01:08:05.293
Tiff...

1489
01:08:05.317 --> 01:08:06.919
who are you?
Wh-where's Tiffany?

1490
01:08:06.943 --> 01:08:08.630
Oh.

1491
01:08:08.654 --> 01:08:10.340
Helen dalrymple,
private investigator.

1492
01:08:10.364 --> 01:08:12.950
Your receptionist let me in.

1493
01:08:14.035 --> 01:08:15.053
Look, I-I don't know

1494
01:08:15.077 --> 01:08:17.014
who you work for, but could...

1495
01:08:17.037 --> 01:08:18.891
I work for you, asshole.

1496
01:08:18.914 --> 01:08:19.975
Ezri stovall hired me.

1497
01:08:19.999 --> 01:08:21.894
Is Dr. Rice in this picture?

1498
01:08:21.917 --> 01:08:23.187
Come again?

1499
01:08:23.211 --> 01:08:24.480
That's what she said. Heh heh.

1500
01:08:24.504 --> 01:08:27.566
Look, ezri said you banged
some shrink at a conference.

1501
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:28.568
He... Dr. Rice.

1502
01:08:28.592 --> 01:08:30.945
Are you still
in contact with her?

1503
01:08:30.969 --> 01:08:32.155
Uh, no. Dr. Rice

1504
01:08:32.178 --> 01:08:34.490
is no longer in the picture.

1505
01:08:34.514 --> 01:08:36.868
She... could...

1506
01:08:36.892 --> 01:08:39.227
please... could you
please not touch my...

1507
01:08:39.270 --> 01:08:43.065
or Tiffany's things?

1508
01:08:43.107 --> 01:08:46.045
Did Ms. Carmichael
mention any other affairs?

1509
01:08:46.068 --> 01:08:47.236
Other doctors she screwed?

1510
01:08:47.278 --> 01:08:50.406
Dentists, podiatrists, clergy?

1511
01:08:50.447 --> 01:08:51.466
Clerg... no.

1512
01:08:51.490 --> 01:08:53.886
I mean, I told
Mr. Stovall everything,

1513
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:58.474
and anything
she told me is confidential.

1514
01:08:58.498 --> 01:08:59.892
Right. Don't wanna abuse

1515
01:08:59.916 --> 01:09:03.063
that doctor-patient
relationship.

1516
01:09:03.086 --> 01:09:05.065
Wait, wait. I...

1517
01:09:05.088 --> 01:09:09.069
Must insist that you leave.

1518
01:09:09.092 --> 01:09:10.904
Don't get lippy with me, doc.

1519
01:09:10.928 --> 01:09:13.365
I didn't screw my patient.

1520
01:09:13.389 --> 01:09:16.016
She w...

1521
01:09:18.269 --> 01:09:20.497
Heh. In an elevator?
Are you kidding me?

1522
01:09:20.521 --> 01:09:22.291
Ha ha!

1523
01:09:22.315 --> 01:09:24.067
We are talking about
stodger Roger, right?

1524
01:09:24.108 --> 01:09:26.253
Heh. Good, old Mr. By the book.

1525
01:09:26.277 --> 01:09:29.424
Ah heh heh. You know,
when I met him,

1526
01:09:29.448 --> 01:09:31.301
he was a 23-year-old virgin,

1527
01:09:31.325 --> 01:09:33.470
and, uh, the morning

1528
01:09:33.493 --> 01:09:36.056
after we had sex
for the first time,

1529
01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.225
I get a call out of the blue

1530
01:09:38.248 --> 01:09:40.936
from an ex-boyfriend
who proposes to me.

1531
01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:41.896
Really?

1532
01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.647
Roger, bless his heart,

1533
01:09:43.671 --> 01:09:45.357
in a fit of jealousy,
jumps up and says,

1534
01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:46.692
"I would marry you."

1535
01:09:46.716 --> 01:09:50.363
Years later, I found out
what he meant...

1536
01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:53.074
Was "could," not "would."

1537
01:09:53.098 --> 01:09:57.245
So, what, you got married
on a grammatical error?

1538
01:09:57.268 --> 01:09:59.663
All I know is, um...

1539
01:09:59.688 --> 01:10:01.415
We were never very happy.

1540
01:10:01.439 --> 01:10:05.003
Uh, has he had many affairs,
your husband?

1541
01:10:05.026 --> 01:10:08.298
Well, there was
that otapi conference

1542
01:10:08.322 --> 01:10:10.384
in Denver a couple of years ago.

1543
01:10:10.407 --> 01:10:13.553
Otapi. That's some kind
of antelope, right?

1544
01:10:13.577 --> 01:10:15.722
What?

1545
01:10:15.746 --> 01:10:18.142
Otapi, the organization

1546
01:10:18.165 --> 01:10:20.603
of therapists, analysts,
blah, blah, blah.

1547
01:10:20.627 --> 01:10:22.021
Come on. Right.

1548
01:10:22.044 --> 01:10:23.439
I shouldn't be
telling you any of this.

1549
01:10:23.463 --> 01:10:25.233
I've had too many of these.

1550
01:10:25.257 --> 01:10:27.443
Darlin', uh...

1551
01:10:27.467 --> 01:10:31.031
You could tell me anything.

1552
01:10:31.054 --> 01:10:33.074
Well...

1553
01:10:33.098 --> 01:10:34.743
He comes back from Denver,

1554
01:10:34.767 --> 01:10:36.577
and he's a changed man.

1555
01:10:36.602 --> 01:10:41.542
All of a sudden,
he is Mr. Oral sex.

1556
01:10:41.565 --> 01:10:46.172
Up until then, Roger
had very rarely, uh...

1557
01:10:46.195 --> 01:10:48.049
Cunnilinged me.

1558
01:10:48.072 --> 01:10:50.676
Can you say, uh, "cunnilinged"?

1559
01:10:50.699 --> 01:10:52.720
Well, I don't know.

1560
01:10:52.744 --> 01:10:55.723
What's the verb for cunnilingus?

1561
01:10:55.747 --> 01:10:57.266
Cunnilingated.

1562
01:10:57.290 --> 01:10:58.643
Stop it.

1563
01:10:58.667 --> 01:10:59.977
Cunnilingual.

1564
01:11:00.001 --> 01:11:00.688
That a verb?

1565
01:11:00.712 --> 01:11:04.256
I don't know, but I like it.

1566
01:11:05.007 --> 01:11:08.070
Anyway, he comes
back from Denver,

1567
01:11:08.093 --> 01:11:09.219
and suddenly he's an expert.

1568
01:11:09.261 --> 01:11:12.557
Oh, yes. He's slow.
He's sensual.

1569
01:11:12.598 --> 01:11:16.226
He's circular.

1570
01:11:17.728 --> 01:11:20.731
Am I boring you?

1571
01:11:21.399 --> 01:11:23.234
Not a bit.

1572
01:11:26.071 --> 01:11:27.340
Salty.

1573
01:11:27.363 --> 01:11:29.217
Oh, and he started
doing this, um,

1574
01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:31.010
this circle thing,
you know, with the...

1575
01:11:31.034 --> 01:11:33.513
with his hands
on my... on my breasts,

1576
01:11:33.537 --> 01:11:37.016
kind of like... like that.

1577
01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:39.061
Really? Yeah.

1578
01:11:39.085 --> 01:11:40.145
Whoa. Heh.

1579
01:11:40.169 --> 01:11:42.189
And, uh... Wow.

1580
01:11:42.213 --> 01:11:44.215
I let the whole thing
drop, and then, uh,

1581
01:11:44.256 --> 01:11:45.776
oh, about 5, 6 months later,

1582
01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:49.721
he got a card in the
mail from a Dr. Rice.

1583
01:11:49.762 --> 01:11:51.407
Looked like an invitation.

1584
01:11:51.431 --> 01:11:52.409
Who's Dr. Rice?

1585
01:11:52.433 --> 01:11:55.035
Exactly what I said,

1586
01:11:55.059 --> 01:11:56.371
you know, very nicely,

1587
01:11:56.394 --> 01:11:57.705
and, uh, Roger
got very flustered.

1588
01:11:57.729 --> 01:12:00.375
And stammered something
about it obviously

1589
01:12:00.398 --> 01:12:03.777
being addressed
to the wrong Dr. Klink.

1590
01:12:07.197 --> 01:12:14.663
Is Dr. Rice a boy doctor
or a girl doctor?

1591
01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:18.251
A girl doctor.

1592
01:12:19.585 --> 01:12:20.563
Are you sure?

1593
01:12:20.587 --> 01:12:23.065
Heh. Well, who else but a girl

1594
01:12:23.089 --> 01:12:24.067
could have taught him

1595
01:12:24.091 --> 01:12:27.612
all those good things
that he knew?

1596
01:12:27.636 --> 01:12:28.738
Well, thank you...

1597
01:12:28.762 --> 01:12:31.723
Heh. For your help.

1598
01:12:32.641 --> 01:12:35.871
We, um... we are
separated, you know.

1599
01:12:35.895 --> 01:12:36.790
Mmm.

1600
01:12:36.814 --> 01:12:39.750
Uh, do you live alone?

1601
01:12:39.774 --> 01:12:41.835
I, um...

1602
01:12:41.859 --> 01:12:43.336
Have a roommate.

1603
01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:46.257
But, uh, listen,
uh, here's my card,

1604
01:12:46.281 --> 01:12:49.927
and, uh, if you can
think of anything else,

1605
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:51.804
why, uh, you can call me.

1606
01:12:51.827 --> 01:12:53.556
Oh. Day and night.

1607
01:12:53.579 --> 01:12:54.516
Thank you.

1608
01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:56.207
Ma'am.

1609
01:12:59.795 --> 01:13:01.880
I'll see you.

1610
01:13:22.944 --> 01:13:23.922
No!

1611
01:13:23.946 --> 01:13:25.966
What's going on?

1612
01:13:25.989 --> 01:13:27.467
Good morning, counsel.

1613
01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:30.744
Hi, counsel. How's it hanging?

1614
01:13:31.286 --> 01:13:32.764
Connie: Better put that
animal of yours in a cage,

1615
01:13:32.788 --> 01:13:35.767
or I'll have to get
a restraining order.

1616
01:13:35.791 --> 01:13:37.894
Ezri: Your client
has violated rules

1617
01:13:37.918 --> 01:13:41.589
regarding ex parte propinquity.

1618
01:13:41.922 --> 01:13:45.009
I'll squeeze in here with you.

1619
01:13:45.718 --> 01:13:48.012
Let's take the stairs.

1620
01:13:49.263 --> 01:13:53.267
I get an erection just
thinking about elevators.

1621
01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:56.914
We were by the door,
standing up.

1622
01:13:56.938 --> 01:13:58.500
He was hugging me,

1623
01:13:58.523 --> 01:14:00.710
moving his hands over my dress

1624
01:14:00.734 --> 01:14:01.878
and then under my dress.

1625
01:14:01.902 --> 01:14:04.464
I wasn't wearing any underwear.

1626
01:14:04.488 --> 01:14:05.781
Oh, baby!

1627
01:14:10.786 --> 01:14:11.847
Hey, Dan, over here.

1628
01:14:11.871 --> 01:14:13.807
Hey. Hey, Larry, what's up?

1629
01:14:13.831 --> 01:14:14.892
You seen Melinda?

1630
01:14:14.915 --> 01:14:17.103
Haven't seen her, bro.

1631
01:14:17.127 --> 01:14:19.313
But you don't think this money's
goin' to her head, do you?

1632
01:14:19.337 --> 01:14:20.398
No, I don't think so.

1633
01:14:20.421 --> 01:14:21.775
In fact, I don't even think

1634
01:14:21.798 --> 01:14:23.567
she's 100% into the whole thing.

1635
01:14:23.591 --> 01:14:25.904
We were talking last...
last... is... this is...

1636
01:14:25.927 --> 01:14:27.864
Larry, this is Melinda naked.

1637
01:14:27.888 --> 01:14:29.783
I took her head

1638
01:14:29.806 --> 01:14:31.034
off last year's Christmas card,

1639
01:14:31.057 --> 01:14:32.827
downloaded the body
off the Internet.

1640
01:14:32.851 --> 01:14:34.829
The rest is
the magic of Photoshop.

1641
01:14:34.853 --> 01:14:36.873
But goddamn, Larry,
she's still naked.

1642
01:14:36.897 --> 01:14:38.667
I-it's not her body.

1643
01:14:38.690 --> 01:14:41.045
With sexy artwork
on the video box,

1644
01:14:41.068 --> 01:14:42.880
I can get double per unit.

1645
01:14:42.904 --> 01:14:44.590
What are you talking about?

1646
01:14:44.614 --> 01:14:45.800
Yee-ha!

1647
01:14:45.823 --> 01:14:47.885
I put my hands in his pants.

1648
01:14:47.909 --> 01:14:49.512
Oh, my God. Larry...

1649
01:14:49.536 --> 01:14:51.431
ok, that's my little surprise.

1650
01:14:51.454 --> 01:14:53.558
Melinda is hot, bro.

1651
01:14:53.581 --> 01:14:55.143
Is that... are those...

1652
01:14:55.167 --> 01:14:56.727
would you look
at this crowd? Heck,

1653
01:14:56.751 --> 01:14:58.772
we could sell
her deposition tapes

1654
01:14:58.796 --> 01:15:00.899
to every bar in town.

1655
01:15:00.923 --> 01:15:02.984
I've got a buddy in salt lake
working on the website.

1656
01:15:03.008 --> 01:15:06.071
Wha... Larry, I am trying
to get back with her.

1657
01:15:06.094 --> 01:15:08.949
...being up on his desk,

1658
01:15:08.972 --> 01:15:10.867
on all fours.

1659
01:15:10.891 --> 01:15:11.910
Whoo! Whoo!

1660
01:15:11.935 --> 01:15:13.871
Larry, have you
seen your brother?

1661
01:15:13.895 --> 01:15:16.940
Speak of the devil.
Hey, Melinda.

1662
01:15:17.941 --> 01:15:19.043
What's this?

1663
01:15:19.067 --> 01:15:20.878
Don't worry.
It's not your body.

1664
01:15:20.902 --> 01:15:22.922
Boo-yah. Why don't we

1665
01:15:22.946 --> 01:15:24.948
turn it off, huh?
I think the game's on.

1666
01:15:26.074 --> 01:15:27.385
...his other hand,

1667
01:15:27.409 --> 01:15:28.720
he was very gently...

1668
01:15:28.743 --> 01:15:30.597
That's me on TV.

1669
01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:33.433
...around and around and around

1670
01:15:33.457 --> 01:15:36.937
and up and down on...

1671
01:15:36.961 --> 01:15:38.439
Mrs. Happy! Mrs. Happy!

1672
01:15:38.463 --> 01:15:40.899
Turn it off! Turn it off!

1673
01:15:40.923 --> 01:15:42.943
Whoo hoo! Whee-hah!

1674
01:15:42.967 --> 01:15:43.903
Danny?

1675
01:15:43.927 --> 01:15:46.905
Uh, oh, Mel, oh, shit.

1676
01:15:46.930 --> 01:15:47.741
How could you?

1677
01:15:47.765 --> 01:15:49.533
I didn't. I swear.

1678
01:15:49.557 --> 01:15:50.618
How could you?

1679
01:15:50.641 --> 01:15:51.703
I didn't. Mel, I swear.

1680
01:15:51.727 --> 01:15:54.748
Mel, I swear to God
I didn't. Mel.

1681
01:15:54.771 --> 01:15:56.500
All right, look, why don't we...

1682
01:15:56.523 --> 01:15:57.460
look, that's my wife!

1683
01:15:57.484 --> 01:15:58.960
Can we please turn it off?

1684
01:15:58.984 --> 01:15:59.962
Hey! Hey, everybody!

1685
01:15:59.986 --> 01:16:01.945
It's Mr. Happy!

1686
01:16:04.656 --> 01:16:05.717
Hey, come on, buddy!

1687
01:16:05.741 --> 01:16:06.719
Hey, hey, hey...

1688
01:16:06.743 --> 01:16:09.704
the best part! Get down, now!

1689
01:16:09.746 --> 01:16:11.056
Get him off of there.

1690
01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:12.058
Get off me!

1691
01:16:12.082 --> 01:16:15.543
Unh!

1692
01:16:28.015 --> 01:16:30.934
Yes.

1693
01:16:31.977 --> 01:16:33.705
You're kidding.

1694
01:16:33.729 --> 01:16:35.582
That's not so bad.

1695
01:16:35.606 --> 01:16:36.940
When?

1696
01:16:38.776 --> 01:16:40.629
Good idea.

1697
01:16:40.653 --> 01:16:42.131
Time is of the essence.

1698
01:16:42.155 --> 01:16:43.841
Get hold of Dr. Paige
and warn her.

1699
01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:48.995
No, no. I-I'll convey
the message to Mr. Stovall.

1700
01:16:53.833 --> 01:16:55.019
What's up?

1701
01:16:55.043 --> 01:16:56.479
Good news for our team.

1702
01:16:56.503 --> 01:16:58.023
Carmichaels are
splitting up for good.

1703
01:16:58.047 --> 01:17:01.609
Melinda's at some hotel
by the highway.

1704
01:17:01.633 --> 01:17:03.696
She's very upset.

1705
01:17:03.719 --> 01:17:06.114
I'd like to give her
a day's rest.

1706
01:17:06.138 --> 01:17:11.060
Johnson thinks we should move on
to Dr. Paige's deposition.

1707
01:17:11.894 --> 01:17:15.833
I'm not sure I'm
prepared for Dr. Paige.

1708
01:17:15.856 --> 01:17:17.460
Ezri...

1709
01:17:17.483 --> 01:17:21.029
It would mean
an awful lot to me.

1710
01:17:33.876 --> 01:17:36.713
Max, you ever think
about the other road,

1711
01:17:36.754 --> 01:17:39.716
the one you didn't walk down?

1712
01:17:39.966 --> 01:17:42.487
The one you stood
at the mouth of,

1713
01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:45.823
but were afraid to walk down,
afraid to...

1714
01:17:45.847 --> 01:17:48.891
Let down your hair and run?

1715
01:17:51.061 --> 01:17:52.956
Ah, I'm waxing rhetorical,

1716
01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:55.792
not looking for an answer,
just a little...

1717
01:17:55.816 --> 01:17:58.861
Anonymous companionship.

1718
01:18:00.195 --> 01:18:01.298
Here, doc,

1719
01:18:01.322 --> 01:18:02.424
compliments of the ladies

1720
01:18:02.448 --> 01:18:04.908
at the end of the bar.

1721
01:18:06.910 --> 01:18:10.832
It's the corvette, Max.
The women love it.

1722
01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:12.852
To Dr. Majestic.

1723
01:18:12.876 --> 01:18:14.854
Women: Dr. Majestic.

1724
01:18:14.878 --> 01:18:16.814
Who told you that?

1725
01:18:16.838 --> 01:18:18.858
That's con...
that's confidential

1726
01:18:18.882 --> 01:18:22.654
uh, doctor-cli...
uh, attorney...

1727
01:18:22.677 --> 01:18:24.721
Ahh! Ahh.

1728
01:18:26.681 --> 01:18:28.683
Hey, doc, you forgot
your picture.

1729
01:18:57.964 --> 01:18:59.359
Oh.

1730
01:18:59.383 --> 01:19:00.735
Man: ♪ bingo
was his name-o... ♪

1731
01:19:00.759 --> 01:19:01.820
Hi.

1732
01:19:01.844 --> 01:19:04.198
Uh, is Felix in?

1733
01:19:04.221 --> 01:19:06.701
He's in the shower.

1734
01:19:06.724 --> 01:19:09.161
Oh, you're the roommate.

1735
01:19:09.185 --> 01:19:11.581
Oh, ha ha ha! He said
he had a roommate.

1736
01:19:11.604 --> 01:19:12.707
I totally for...

1737
01:19:12.730 --> 01:19:14.834
Did he? And you must be...

1738
01:19:14.857 --> 01:19:17.420
I'm... I'm Jennifer.

1739
01:19:17.444 --> 01:19:20.006
I'm, uh, the almost
ex-Mrs. Dr. Klink.

1740
01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:21.758
Right.

1741
01:19:21.782 --> 01:19:23.051
And you're here because...

1742
01:19:23.075 --> 01:19:24.803
Well, ah heh heh.

1743
01:19:24.827 --> 01:19:28.056
I have a very valuable
piece of evidence

1744
01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:33.812
to help screw my future
ex-husband, and, um...

1745
01:19:33.836 --> 01:19:36.565
I'd really like
to give it to Felix.

1746
01:19:36.589 --> 01:19:38.943
Well, we're not just roommates.

1747
01:19:38.967 --> 01:19:39.986
We're partners.

1748
01:19:40.009 --> 01:19:42.029
Oh. Perfect. Ok.

1749
01:19:42.053 --> 01:19:44.073
So what happened is
a got a call from Max,

1750
01:19:44.097 --> 01:19:46.784
the bartender down
at the wild bill lounge.

1751
01:19:46.808 --> 01:19:49.704
He didn't know
Roger and I had split,

1752
01:19:49.728 --> 01:19:52.165
so he called the house,
and, uh... heh.

1753
01:19:52.189 --> 01:19:54.292
Looky what my husband

1754
01:19:54.316 --> 01:19:56.920
left behind-y in the bar.

1755
01:19:56.944 --> 01:20:00.215
I've seen this picture before.
What's the big deal?

1756
01:20:00.239 --> 01:20:03.260
Wh... that's Dr. Rice
next to my husband.

1757
01:20:03.283 --> 01:20:05.971
Ex! Ex-husband. Uhh!
Ex-husband.

1758
01:20:05.995 --> 01:20:09.850
I mean, look at
their hands. It's...

1759
01:20:09.874 --> 01:20:12.668
That's Dr. Rice?

1760
01:20:14.004 --> 01:20:17.108
"To a great orator, love, E.R."

1761
01:20:17.132 --> 01:20:21.237
Dr. Rice taught Roger the, uh,

1762
01:20:21.261 --> 01:20:23.990
cunnilingual arts,
as Felix put it.

1763
01:20:24.014 --> 01:20:25.992
Isn't that funny? Ha ha ha ha!

1764
01:20:26.016 --> 01:20:28.144
Is that how he put it?

1765
01:20:31.272 --> 01:20:34.627
♪ There was

1766
01:20:34.651 --> 01:20:36.921

01:20:39.947 --> 01:20:44.887
Does Felix take long showers?

1769
01:20:44.911 --> 01:20:49.059
We're lovers, not just partners.

1770
01:20:49.082 --> 01:20:50.977
Oh, yes. Ok.

1771
01:20:51.001 --> 01:20:52.938
Well, I never would
have, uh, ahem,

1772
01:20:52.961 --> 01:20:55.065
I mean, look at me. It's...

1773
01:20:55.088 --> 01:20:56.733
A lot of fringe and... ok.

1774
01:20:56.757 --> 01:20:58.985
Well, he'd... he'd called
you his roommate,

1775
01:20:59.009 --> 01:21:00.987
just... just so you know that.

1776
01:21:01.011 --> 01:21:02.114
Sorry.

1777
01:21:02.138 --> 01:21:03.199
Oh, that's ok.

1778
01:21:03.222 --> 01:21:05.034
That's ok.

1779
01:21:05.058 --> 01:21:06.869
This, um... this is
an Idaho chardonnay,

1780
01:21:06.893 --> 01:21:08.705
if you wanna...

1781
01:21:08.728 --> 01:21:09.956
I'm gonna go.

1782
01:21:09.979 --> 01:21:12.374
Uh, keep the photo.

1783
01:21:12.398 --> 01:21:15.044
Keep this. Heh.

1784
01:21:15.068 --> 01:21:17.004
And, uh...

1785
01:21:17.028 --> 01:21:19.906
Bust his balls
for me, would you?

1786
01:21:19.948 --> 01:21:23.077
Don't worry.

1787
01:21:54.276 --> 01:21:56.088
This better be good.

1788
01:21:56.112 --> 01:21:59.383
I found a picture of klink
with Dr. Rice.

1789
01:21:59.406 --> 01:22:00.926
Meaningless. Good-bye.

1790
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:04.120
Guess who Dr. Rice is.

1791
01:22:05.455 --> 01:22:08.250
Really?

1792
01:22:08.958 --> 01:22:10.019
Are you sure?

1793
01:22:10.042 --> 01:22:12.462
Positive.

1794
01:22:14.965 --> 01:22:17.425
I'll call you back.

1795
01:22:32.358 --> 01:22:36.255
Conthuela, that was amathing.

1796
01:22:36.279 --> 01:22:39.533
That was a class-a misdemeanor.

1797
01:22:40.450 --> 01:22:42.429
My dear...

1798
01:22:42.452 --> 01:22:44.013
That was a felony.

1799
01:22:44.037 --> 01:22:45.265
You know what I hate?

1800
01:22:45.289 --> 01:22:48.018
I hate that one of us
has to lose.

1801
01:22:48.042 --> 01:22:50.961
I wish we could both win.

1802
01:22:53.964 --> 01:22:55.483
Ohh. Ok.

1803
01:22:55.507 --> 01:22:58.028
Ok.

1804
01:22:58.052 --> 01:23:00.906
Ok. Ha.

1805
01:23:00.930 --> 01:23:01.908
Ah ha!

1806
01:23:01.932 --> 01:23:03.266
Ha ha ha!

1807
01:23:05.185 --> 01:23:07.080
Ezri: Exhibit "a"
is a group photograph

1808
01:23:07.103 --> 01:23:09.248
from the otapi
shrink convention,

1809
01:23:09.272 --> 01:23:12.085
Denver, 1999.

1810
01:23:12.108 --> 01:23:13.920
Do you recognize the woman

1811
01:23:13.944 --> 01:23:16.988
standing next to Roger klink?

1812
01:23:18.239 --> 01:23:19.551
Of course I do.

1813
01:23:19.575 --> 01:23:20.927
Would you please read

1814
01:23:20.951 --> 01:23:24.580
what's written on
the back of the photo.

1815
01:23:26.123 --> 01:23:30.086
"To a great orator, love, E.R."

1816
01:23:30.127 --> 01:23:31.106
Who's E.R.?

1817
01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:33.548
Emily rice.

1818
01:23:33.965 --> 01:23:36.486
Ezri: Who is Emily rice?

1819
01:23:36.509 --> 01:23:39.364
Me. I am. Uh...

1820
01:23:39.387 --> 01:23:40.948
I was.

1821
01:23:40.973 --> 01:23:45.036
My second former husband
was Eugene rice.

1822
01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:48.915
What did you mean,
"a great orator"?

1823
01:23:48.939 --> 01:23:50.917
It's double entendre.

1824
01:23:50.941 --> 01:23:53.003
It... no big deal.

1825
01:23:53.026 --> 01:23:55.589
It refers to oral sex.

1826
01:23:55.613 --> 01:23:57.365
We had a fling in Denver.

1827
01:23:58.491 --> 01:23:59.593
We hardly left the room
for 3 days,

1828
01:23:59.617 --> 01:24:01.971
although it was
more of a workshop,

1829
01:24:01.995 --> 01:24:04.348
considering Roger was
a sexual fledgling.

1830
01:24:04.372 --> 01:24:05.183
I object!

1831
01:24:05.207 --> 01:24:07.083
It's the truth.

1832
01:24:07.125 --> 01:24:08.978
I tutored him in various
sexual techniques.

1833
01:24:09.002 --> 01:24:11.087
Granted, he...
he was a quick learner.

1834
01:24:11.129 --> 01:24:14.984
He made the greatest strides
in the oral disciplines,

1835
01:24:15.008 --> 01:24:16.403
hence "a great orator."

1836
01:24:16.426 --> 01:24:18.947
Oral? You and Dr. Klink?

1837
01:24:18.971 --> 01:24:21.074
I named his penis Mr. Majestic.

1838
01:24:21.098 --> 01:24:23.243
To boost his confidence.

1839
01:24:23.267 --> 01:24:24.119
Oh, Jesus...

1840
01:24:24.143 --> 01:24:24.996
oh, God! Oh, man.

1841
01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:27.205
Should I go off record?

1842
01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:28.124
Don't you dare.

1843
01:24:28.148 --> 01:24:30.042
I showed him everything.

1844
01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:31.960
I crammed 6 months
of training into 3 days.

1845
01:24:31.984 --> 01:24:34.422
Oh, and we had
an elevator in Denver.

1846
01:24:34.445 --> 01:24:36.925
You two had sex in an elevator?

1847
01:24:36.948 --> 01:24:38.509
Well... well, he was too timid.

1848
01:24:38.533 --> 01:24:40.428
"What if someone comes?
I'm so scared."

1849
01:24:40.451 --> 01:24:42.931
You were like
a supercharged sex instructor!

1850
01:24:42.954 --> 01:24:44.080
A square-dance caller!

1851
01:24:44.122 --> 01:24:45.183
"Roll over.

1852
01:24:45.206 --> 01:24:46.560
"Rub here. Touch this.

1853
01:24:46.583 --> 01:24:48.937
On your back. On your knees."

1854
01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:51.481
Uhh! It was like
sexual boot camp.

1855
01:24:51.505 --> 01:24:54.258
You loved it,
and then you have the nerve

1856
01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:57.196
to share my advanced
circle technique with her.

1857
01:24:57.219 --> 01:24:59.114
Those circles are mine!

1858
01:24:59.138 --> 01:25:00.491
I gave him that technique.

1859
01:25:00.515 --> 01:25:03.453
But that's all it is
to you, technique

1860
01:25:03.476 --> 01:25:04.954
and disciplines, maneuvers.

1861
01:25:04.977 --> 01:25:07.082
I mean, if you had
just shut up once

1862
01:25:07.105 --> 01:25:09.125
during the whole weekend
and let me be me,

1863
01:25:09.149 --> 01:25:11.336
I might never have
gone back to my wife.

1864
01:25:11.359 --> 01:25:14.422
You should've
told me, Dr. Paige.

1865
01:25:14.446 --> 01:25:15.423
It had no bearing.

1866
01:25:15.447 --> 01:25:16.425
You pressed me to sue him.

1867
01:25:16.449 --> 01:25:18.677
You wanted to nail the bastard.

1868
01:25:18.701 --> 01:25:21.388
You used me to get
back at Dr. Klink!

1869
01:25:21.412 --> 01:25:23.139
How could you?

1870
01:25:23.164 --> 01:25:24.933
You, you stole the circles
from Dr. Paige!

1871
01:25:24.957 --> 01:25:27.979
Hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

1872
01:25:28.002 --> 01:25:30.106
No, no! I was trying to help!

1873
01:25:30.129 --> 01:25:32.233
You used Mrs. Carmichael,

1874
01:25:32.256 --> 01:25:33.610
a broken woman.

1875
01:25:33.633 --> 01:25:34.986
Who was unable to defend herself

1876
01:25:35.009 --> 01:25:37.929
from the advances
of this sexual predator.

1877
01:25:37.971 --> 01:25:42.077
Predator? He's a leaf-eater,
a sexual herbivore.

1878
01:25:42.101 --> 01:25:43.661
I object. Th...

1879
01:25:43.685 --> 01:25:45.288
a predator created
by Dr. Paige.

1880
01:25:45.312 --> 01:25:49.084
Oh, but then... but then
her creation spurned her.

1881
01:25:49.108 --> 01:25:50.919
So you set out to destroy him,

1882
01:25:50.943 --> 01:25:54.047
and this innocent woman
just got in your way.

1883
01:25:54.071 --> 01:25:55.090
None of this is true!

1884
01:25:55.114 --> 01:25:57.260
You have ruined
my life, Dr. Paige.

1885
01:25:57.283 --> 01:25:58.594
My marriage is over,

1886
01:25:58.618 --> 01:25:59.928
Dan's become a greedy asshole,

1887
01:25:59.952 --> 01:26:01.514
and his shit brother is selling

1888
01:26:01.537 --> 01:26:04.100
the deposition tapes
at local bars!

1889
01:26:04.124 --> 01:26:06.126
Wha...

1890
01:26:07.002 --> 01:26:09.105
I did it!

1891
01:26:09.129 --> 01:26:10.774
Oh, you're fired.

1892
01:26:10.797 --> 01:26:12.466
You can't fire her.
She's pregnant.

1893
01:26:14.134 --> 01:26:16.070
Uhh. The tapes
are meaningless now.

1894
01:26:16.094 --> 01:26:18.597
Remember your wish
last night, consuela?

1895
01:26:18.639 --> 01:26:20.450
Last night?

1896
01:26:20.474 --> 01:26:22.351
That both of us
could win this case.

1897
01:26:22.518 --> 01:26:24.246
That isn't possible,

1898
01:26:24.270 --> 01:26:25.998
but I've come up with
the next best thing.

1899
01:26:26.022 --> 01:26:28.668
First, you drop
your suit against klink.

1900
01:26:28.691 --> 01:26:29.461
Do what?

1901
01:26:29.485 --> 01:26:30.670
Drop the suit? Never!

1902
01:26:30.693 --> 01:26:32.422
You file a suit on behalf

1903
01:26:32.445 --> 01:26:34.257
of Mrs. Carmichael and klink,

1904
01:26:34.281 --> 01:26:36.717
the real victims in this case,

1905
01:26:36.741 --> 01:26:38.761
against the real villain,

1906
01:26:38.785 --> 01:26:44.392
the conniving and
vengeful Dr. Paige.

1907
01:26:44.416 --> 01:26:46.102
This'll never hold up in court.

1908
01:26:46.126 --> 01:26:48.188
It won't have to. You'll settle

1909
01:26:48.211 --> 01:26:49.606
out of court for 5 million,

1910
01:26:49.630 --> 01:26:51.066
which the company will agree to.

1911
01:26:51.089 --> 01:26:55.154
And Melinda and klink
will split 5 million.

1912
01:26:55.178 --> 01:26:56.073
Minus 30%.

1913
01:26:56.097 --> 01:26:57.156
Everyone's a winner.

1914
01:26:57.180 --> 01:26:59.098
Well, not everyone.

1915
01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:00.284
According to the settlement,

1916
01:27:00.308 --> 01:27:03.102
Dr. Paige will
lose her license.

1917
01:27:03.144 --> 01:27:04.747
Lose my license?

1918
01:27:04.771 --> 01:27:06.440
But there is an island
in the Caribbean

1919
01:27:06.481 --> 01:27:08.501
where you do not need a license

1920
01:27:08.525 --> 01:27:10.420
to practice
the psychiatric arts.

1921
01:27:10.444 --> 01:27:12.112
Ahh!

1922
01:27:12.696 --> 01:27:13.756
Grand Cayman.

1923
01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:15.258
The Caribbean?

1924
01:27:15.282 --> 01:27:18.136
Brilliant. It's a happy ending.

1925
01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:19.787
You are the greatest.

1926
01:27:25.251 --> 01:27:27.730
Ezri: Come here, you big lug.

1927
01:27:27.753 --> 01:27:32.318
Melinda, Roger, congratulations!

1928
01:27:32.342 --> 01:27:34.028
We won! We're rich!

1929
01:27:34.052 --> 01:27:36.823
Emily: This is insane!

1930
01:27:36.847 --> 01:27:39.683
I won't agree. I wanna
speak to my attorney.

1931
01:27:43.061 --> 01:27:44.605
I'm your attorney.

1932
01:27:46.357 --> 01:27:49.044
Every shrink
in the great state of Idaho

1933
01:27:49.068 --> 01:27:52.715
has the same malpractice plan
and the same lawyer,

1934
01:27:52.739 --> 01:27:54.091
ezri stovall.

1935
01:27:54.115 --> 01:27:56.719
As your attorney
and the one voice

1936
01:27:56.743 --> 01:27:58.303
the insurance company
listens to,

1937
01:27:58.328 --> 01:28:00.598
I recommend we settle
out of court.

1938
01:28:00.622 --> 01:28:05.085
But... but you never
settle out of court.

1939
01:28:08.797 --> 01:28:12.425
I will for you.

1940
01:28:15.303 --> 01:28:17.598
Love means making sacrifices.

1941
01:28:21.769 --> 01:28:22.747
I'm sorry, Emily.

1942
01:28:22.771 --> 01:28:24.856
Would you like some champagne?

1943
01:28:26.107 --> 01:28:29.086
No? Melinda?

1944
01:28:29.110 --> 01:28:32.113
Aah! Goddamn lawyers
and doctors, go to hell!

1945
01:28:33.782 --> 01:28:35.867
Melinda?

1946
01:28:36.785 --> 01:28:38.763
Melinda, wait!

1947
01:28:38.787 --> 01:28:41.248
Ahh! Gahh!

1948
01:28:41.581 --> 01:28:42.725
Roger! Wait!

1949
01:28:42.749 --> 01:28:43.769
Roger!

1950
01:28:43.793 --> 01:28:46.879
Roger! Roger!

1951
01:28:47.755 --> 01:28:51.234
And when did you
come up with all of this?

1952
01:28:51.258 --> 01:28:52.861
After you fell asleep.

1953
01:28:52.885 --> 01:28:53.946
I fell asleep?

1954
01:28:53.969 --> 01:28:54.948
Mm-hmm.

1955
01:28:54.972 --> 01:28:56.949
So we didn't...

1956
01:28:56.972 --> 01:28:59.577
No.

1957
01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:00.787
I missed it.

1958
01:29:00.811 --> 01:29:01.871
I took the liberty

1959
01:29:01.895 --> 01:29:04.540
of rescheduling you for 3:00.

1960
01:29:04.565 --> 01:29:06.918
It's time!

1961
01:29:06.942 --> 01:29:08.670
T-time?

1962
01:29:08.694 --> 01:29:10.922
Uh-huh. The baby.

1963
01:29:10.946 --> 01:29:12.989
Ohh.

1964
01:29:36.890 --> 01:29:38.892
Melinda! I'll follow.

1965
01:29:41.937 --> 01:29:43.415
Roger! Roger!

1966
01:29:43.439 --> 01:29:45.274
Get back here!

1967
01:29:58.872 --> 01:30:00.392
Pull over!

1968
01:30:00.415 --> 01:30:02.667
We need to talk!

1969
01:30:09.633 --> 01:30:11.551
Ohh! Roger!

1970
01:30:11.927 --> 01:30:13.739
Roger!

1971
01:30:13.763 --> 01:30:15.305
Brother, Emily.

1972
01:30:16.015 --> 01:30:17.535
Roger!

1973
01:30:17.558 --> 01:30:21.312
Roger, for the love...

1974
01:30:28.945 --> 01:30:31.782
Come on. Come on.

1975
01:30:59.602 --> 01:31:00.788
Go away! Ohh!

1976
01:31:00.812 --> 01:31:02.665
Guhh. Ok. All right.

1977
01:31:02.689 --> 01:31:04.584
Listen, I must've been crazy

1978
01:31:04.607 --> 01:31:06.002
to risk losing you, ok?

1979
01:31:06.026 --> 01:31:07.879
Screw the money.
Screw the lawyers.

1980
01:31:07.903 --> 01:31:09.923
Screw Larry.
Sc-screw the shrinks.

1981
01:31:09.947 --> 01:31:11.800
I j... I just want you.

1982
01:31:11.824 --> 01:31:13.677
I'm begging you, please.
I'm begging you.

1983
01:31:13.701 --> 01:31:15.929
I need you.
We're a team, remember?

1984
01:31:15.953 --> 01:31:17.764
Siegfried & Roy, ham and cheese.

1985
01:31:17.788 --> 01:31:19.851
You don't care about the money?

1986
01:31:19.874 --> 01:31:21.435
I don't need money
to be happy, Mel.

1987
01:31:21.459 --> 01:31:24.814
I just need you. That's it.

1988
01:31:24.838 --> 01:31:30.111
I missed you so much.

1989
01:31:30.134 --> 01:31:32.095
Kiss me.

1990
01:31:35.849 --> 01:31:38.078
I lied to you.

1991
01:31:38.102 --> 01:31:40.330
I didn't throw
my diaphragm away or lose it.

1992
01:31:40.354 --> 01:31:40.938
You didn't?

1993
01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:42.415
It's here in my purse.

1994
01:31:42.439 --> 01:31:46.379
And do you... do you have
any of that, uh, sauce?

1995
01:31:46.402 --> 01:31:47.921
Spermicidal gel?

1996
01:31:47.945 --> 01:31:49.006
Say it again.

1997
01:31:49.029 --> 01:31:51.574
Spermicidal gel.

1998
01:31:53.784 --> 01:31:55.513
Go get it, Mel.
We're in business.

1999
01:31:55.536 --> 01:31:56.680
Mr. Happy!

2000
01:31:56.704 --> 01:31:57.891
Let's not call it that anymore.

2001
01:31:57.914 --> 01:31:59.643
What should we call it?!

2002
01:31:59.666 --> 01:32:01.435
I'll think of something.
Let's... come on.

2003
01:32:01.459 --> 01:32:02.354
Ok, ok. All right.

2004
01:32:02.378 --> 01:32:04.606
All right. I'll be right back.

2005
01:32:04.630 --> 01:32:06.047
Oh, my God.

2006
01:32:08.592 --> 01:32:11.053
Oh, God.

2007
01:32:13.639 --> 01:32:14.575
Heh heh.

2008
01:32:14.599 --> 01:32:16.451
Oh, my God.

2009
01:32:16.475 --> 01:32:18.412
Oh, I love birth control.

2010
01:32:18.435 --> 01:32:19.080
Heh heh heh.

2011
01:32:19.104 --> 01:32:20.706
Why are you laughing?

2012
01:32:20.730 --> 01:32:21.999
We're rich.

2013
01:32:22.023 --> 01:32:23.584
There was a settlement,

2014
01:32:23.608 --> 01:32:28.048
and we get almost $2 million.

2015
01:32:28.071 --> 01:32:29.757
We're rich.

2016
01:32:29.781 --> 01:32:31.802
Yeah.

2017
01:32:31.825 --> 01:32:33.804
Ah. We can afford
one of those tract houses.

2018
01:32:33.827 --> 01:32:35.871
Mm-hmm.

2019
01:32:36.038 --> 01:32:37.122
Dan: Oh, God.

2020
01:32:48.051 --> 01:32:48.927
Oh, God! Oh, God!

2021
01:32:49.844 --> 01:32:52.824
Melinda, are you all right?!

2022
01:32:52.847 --> 01:32:55.767
Oh, God. Danny, it's him!

2023
01:32:57.226 --> 01:32:58.663
And that's how we got here.

2024
01:32:58.687 --> 01:33:00.915
Klink, Paige, rice.

2025
01:33:00.939 --> 01:33:02.542
Need a goddamn program.

2026
01:33:02.566 --> 01:33:04.109
Yeah.

2027
01:33:04.526 --> 01:33:05.545
Deputy: Hey.

2028
01:33:05.569 --> 01:33:06.570
Turn that damn thing off.

2029
01:33:06.611 --> 01:33:07.905
All right, I've had
about enough.

2030
01:33:07.947 --> 01:33:11.051
Get yourself in position
near the door. We're going in.

2031
01:33:11.075 --> 01:33:12.886
Deputy: Here.

2032
01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:14.888
Thank you, little lady.

2033
01:33:14.912 --> 01:33:16.807
Dan: Hurry!

2034
01:33:16.831 --> 01:33:18.726
Oh, God! I love you, Danny!

2035
01:33:18.749 --> 01:33:20.394
I love you, too, baby!

2036
01:33:20.418 --> 01:33:24.941
Wait! Let me try
talking to them.

2037
01:33:24.965 --> 01:33:28.069
Melinda, on bullhorn:
Dr. Paige.

2038
01:33:28.093 --> 01:33:29.863
Dr. Klink.

2039
01:33:29.886 --> 01:33:33.408
Honesty first, right?

2040
01:33:33.432 --> 01:33:36.995
I mean, Dr. Paige, what do
you want from Dr. Klink,

2041
01:33:37.018 --> 01:33:38.872
and vice versa?

2042
01:33:38.895 --> 01:33:41.000
Danny and me took your advice.

2043
01:33:41.023 --> 01:33:44.920
We were finally honest
with each other.

2044
01:33:44.944 --> 01:33:46.631
It worked.

2045
01:33:46.654 --> 01:33:47.840
Yeah, a-all relationships

2046
01:33:47.864 --> 01:33:49.133
are killed by, uh, dishonesty,

2047
01:33:49.156 --> 01:33:51.010
repressed feelings,
things left unsaid...

2048
01:33:51.033 --> 01:33:52.720
things like that, you know?

2049
01:33:52.744 --> 01:33:54.847
Come on, you guys.
Honesty first, huh?

2050
01:33:54.871 --> 01:33:57.558
Emily, I wanted to be
with you so bad,

2051
01:33:57.582 --> 01:34:00.668
I was sick after
the otapi conference.

2052
01:34:01.544 --> 01:34:03.314
Roger, I want you.

2053
01:34:03.338 --> 01:34:05.066
I've wanted to be
close to you since Denver.

2054
01:34:05.090 --> 01:34:06.902
It's all I've ever wanted.

2055
01:34:06.925 --> 01:34:08.404
My wife and I were married

2056
01:34:08.427 --> 01:34:09.905
because of a grammatical
misunderstanding.

2057
01:34:09.928 --> 01:34:11.573
She thought I proposed.

2058
01:34:11.597 --> 01:34:13.034
I only meant.

2059
01:34:13.057 --> 01:34:14.493
I could hypothetically
marry her.

2060
01:34:14.517 --> 01:34:15.912
I only married Mr. Paige
to make you jealous.

2061
01:34:15.935 --> 01:34:17.454
I... I fantasized that you

2062
01:34:17.478 --> 01:34:18.998
would burst into the church
and stop it.

2063
01:34:19.022 --> 01:34:20.082
That was my fantasy.

2064
01:34:20.106 --> 01:34:22.084
I wanted to, but I was afraid.

2065
01:34:22.108 --> 01:34:24.003
Oh, Roger, let's start over,
honesty first.

2066
01:34:24.027 --> 01:34:27.215
I... I was thinking
there's gotta be a need

2067
01:34:27.239 --> 01:34:29.967
for couples counseling
on grand Cayman, right?

2068
01:34:29.991 --> 01:34:32.804
That's what I was thinking.

2069
01:34:32.827 --> 01:34:34.955
I love you, Emily.

2070
01:34:35.497 --> 01:34:38.709
Ohh. I love you, Roger.

2071
01:34:41.712 --> 01:34:42.898
Aah! Don't shoot me!

2072
01:34:42.922 --> 01:34:44.900
Oh, God! Danny!

2073
01:34:44.924 --> 01:34:46.235
Aah!

2074
01:34:46.259 --> 01:34:48.029
Aah!

2075
01:34:48.053 --> 01:34:48.928
Medic: What the?

2076
01:34:51.514 --> 01:34:54.118
Melinda! Melinda!

2077
01:34:54.142 --> 01:34:55.870
Melinda!

2078
01:34:55.894 --> 01:34:58.707
Go evasive! Go evasive!

2079
01:34:58.730 --> 01:34:59.542
Are you shot?

2080
01:34:59.566 --> 01:35:00.875
No. It's champagne.

2081
01:35:00.899 --> 01:35:01.877
Champagne?

2082
01:35:01.901 --> 01:35:05.112
Get in there, trousdale.

2083
01:35:08.282 --> 01:35:10.076
Aw, shit.

2084
01:35:19.627 --> 01:35:21.838
Careful, trousdale.

2085
01:35:25.175 --> 01:35:27.677
Well?

2086
01:35:29.054 --> 01:35:31.950
Ohh. Ohh, in circles. Ohh.

2087
01:35:31.974 --> 01:35:34.703
The crisis will be resolved

2088
01:35:34.727 --> 01:35:38.314
in about 30 seconds, sir.

2089
01:35:40.983 --> 01:35:44.797
Goddamn it, you two
better hold on tight this time.

2090
01:35:44.821 --> 01:35:47.549
There isn't anybody else
in the world

2091
01:35:47.573 --> 01:35:48.885
that could love you.

2092
01:35:48.908 --> 01:35:49.887
Yes, sir.

2093
01:35:49.911 --> 01:35:52.579
Heh. Don't worry.

2094
01:36:07.052 --> 01:36:11.265
Consuela, we're
just getting started.

2095
01:36:15.311 --> 01:36:18.273
God, I love a happy ending.

2096
01:36:42.965 --> 01:36:46.969
Lucky Larry's lift.
Come down and get lucky.
