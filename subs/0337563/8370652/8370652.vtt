1
00:01:06.984 --> 00:01:09.028
Move it, dorkus.

2
00:01:12.823 --> 00:01:15.659
Okay, I think you're next.
I'll take your ticket.

3
00:01:16.494 --> 00:01:19.121
Come right around this way.
Keep your back straight.

4
00:01:19.288 --> 00:01:20.998
Put your books down on your lap.

5
00:01:21.165 --> 00:01:25.127
Now, look right up at the camera,
okay? Nice smile. Here we go.

6
00:01:25.294 --> 00:01:28.798
Let me focus right over here.
Okay. Get you in.

7
00:01:28.964 --> 00:01:30.257
That's good.

8
00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:32.843
Swing around this way
just a little bit, Gina.

9
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.137
- It's Jenna.
- Look over here, Gina.

10
00:01:35.304 --> 00:01:37.056
It's Jenna!

11
00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:51.362
Oh, God.

12
00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:54.198
Oh, no.

13
00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:03.582
I've had enough already.

14
00:02:13.551 --> 00:02:15.553
Hey, Jenna.

15
00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.638
Matt, please. No more pictures.

16
00:02:17.805 --> 00:02:21.058
Come on. It's your 13th birthday.
We gotta document it.

17
00:02:31.277 --> 00:02:33.904
- Hi, Tom-Tom.
- Hey, Jenna.

18
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:36.490
Hi, Beaver.
How's everything at the dam?

19
00:02:38.242 --> 00:02:40.619
- So how'd yours come out, Rink?
- Not so good.

20
00:02:40.786 --> 00:02:42.746
Yeah, mine aren't so hot either.

21
00:02:42.913 --> 00:02:46.584
- Tom-Tom, yours are great!
- Yours are the best.

22
00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:49.420
God, you're so photogenic.

23
00:02:49.587 --> 00:02:50.963
I'll meet you out front.

24
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.592
Do whatever you want. It's not
like she needs a play-by-play.

25
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.264
- Freakazoid.
- See you.

26
00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:04.101
Jenna, could I talk to you
a tiny sec?

27
00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:09.189
I told Chris Grandy me and the
Six Chicks were going to your party.

28
00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:12.318
- And he said he wanted to come with.
- Really?

29
00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:15.905
Yeah, it's too bad we can't make it,
because we really wanted to.

30
00:03:16.155 --> 00:03:17.615
- Didn't we, girls?
- Totally.

31
00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:19.909
- So, so much.
- We're so sorry.

32
00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:22.912
Miss Measly's up our butts
with this group project...

33
00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:25.122
and Chris is gonna help us out...

34
00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:28.125
so I guess he can't come either.

35
00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:34.214
- I could write your report for you.
<i>- Fabuloso.</i>

36
00:03:42.598 --> 00:03:46.185
You know, I can't believe
you invited those clones.

37
00:03:46.352 --> 00:03:47.978
They're my friends.

38
00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:50.689
Six Chicks are not your friends, okay?

39
00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:53.400
Well, almost. And someday
I'm gonna be a Six Chick.

40
00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:57.613
There's six of them. That's the point.
There can't be a seventh Six Chick.

41
00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.657
It's just mathematically impossible.

42
00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:02.326
You're cooler than they are.
They're unoriginal.

43
00:04:02.493 --> 00:04:05.579
I don't wanna be original, Matty,
I wanna be cool.

44
00:04:06.997 --> 00:04:09.833
- Want some Razzles?
- Razzles are for kids.

45
00:04:10.668 --> 00:04:12.419
Exactly.

46
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.510
<i>- Arrivederci.
- Au revoir.</i>

47
00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:01.760
- Hey, sweetie.
- Happy birthday!

48
00:05:01.927 --> 00:05:04.179
Tell us about your new
life as a teenager.

49
00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:06.724
What did you do?
Are you wearing a bra?

50
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.769
- Go away!
- Oh, honey, what's wrong?

51
00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:13.480
Wayne. Self-image.

52
00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:17.443
- Jenna, it's going to be all right.
- It is not, Mom! Look at me!

53
00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:22.197
- This is not okay. This is fatal.
- It's not fatal, honey. It's realistic.

54
00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:23.699
I hate my life.

55
00:05:23.866 --> 00:05:26.201
You don't look like girls
in <i>Poise </i>magazine...

56
00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:29.246
but you're beautiful
in your own way.

57
00:05:29.413 --> 00:05:31.707
I don't wanna be beautiful
in my own way.

58
00:05:31.874 --> 00:05:34.293
I wanna look like these people.

59
00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:37.421
Oh, those aren't people, honey.
Those are models.

60
00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:43.010
"Thirty, flirty and thriving. Why the
30s are the best years of your life."

61
00:05:43.177 --> 00:05:44.678
I wanna be 30.

62
00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:47.556
Well, you will be, honey.

63
00:05:47.723 --> 00:05:50.893
But right now you're my
beautiful 13-year-old.

64
00:06:22.758 --> 00:06:24.426
- Happy birthday!
- Oh, my God.

65
00:06:24.593 --> 00:06:28.639
This is just part one of your present.
I got something else to give you later.

66
00:06:28.931 --> 00:06:30.474
What is it?

67
00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:35.062
You know how you always
wanted a Barbie Dream House?

68
00:06:35.312 --> 00:06:41.235
Well, I decided to make you
your own Jenna Dream House.

69
00:06:44.822 --> 00:06:49.284
- You made all this? Oh, Matty.
- Yeah.

70
00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:54.289
See, that's you in your bubble bath,
reading your favorite magazine.

71
00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:57.876
And there's your bedroom,
with a massive stereo...

72
00:06:58.043 --> 00:07:00.337
and every record ever made.

73
00:07:00.504 --> 00:07:01.964
The good ones.

74
00:07:02.131 --> 00:07:07.553
And there's that bum Rick Springfield
loafing on the couch.

75
00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:13.058
And there I am, to make sure the
creep keeps his hands to himself.

76
00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:18.605
Oh, almost forgot. Wishing dust.

77
00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:23.443
It says, "This wishing dust knows
what's in your heart of hearts.

78
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.113
It'll make all your dreams
come true."

79
00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:49.469
They're here.

80
00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:51.430
What do we do?

81
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.059
Oh, my God. Matt, I'm just
gonna put this away, okay?

82
00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:58.187
So there's room to dance.

83
00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:03.192
Put some music on.

84
00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:09.740
Dad, you promised you were
gonna stay upstairs. Go!

85
00:08:13.577 --> 00:08:15.829
Hi, guys. The party's downstairs.

86
00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.674
<i>Fabuloso</i>.

87
00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:15.806
- What is this?
- I'm not sure. It's Matt's.

88
00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:28.068
Sorry, Beave-head. Majority rules.

89
00:09:29.528 --> 00:09:33.490
Narrow, man.
Narrow, hopeless people.

90
00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:36.243
- Freak.
- Robot.

91
00:09:41.123 --> 00:09:43.292
I'm gonna go next door
and get my Casio.

92
00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:46.795
Do whatever you want, Matt.
It's not like I need a play-by-play.

93
00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:50.674
See you, loser.

94
00:09:55.846 --> 00:09:58.390
Hey, I have an idea, girls.

95
00:09:58.557 --> 00:10:00.892
Let's play
Seven Minutes in Heaven.

96
00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:03.520
You can go first,
because you're the birthday girl.

97
00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:05.397
How does that one go, again?

98
00:10:05.564 --> 00:10:09.359
Well, you go in the closet, and some
lucky guy's gonna go in there...

99
00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:13.989
and do whatever he wants
with you for seven whole minutes.

100
00:10:15.282 --> 00:10:16.992
And guess who wants to go first.

101
00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:19.036
- Who?
- Chris Grandy.

102
00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:21.663
- No way.
- Way.

103
00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:32.132
Before I forget,
where's our project proposal?

104
00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:34.468
- On the table.
- Thanks.

105
00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:37.888
Remember, no peeking.
Keep that blindfold on.

106
00:10:38.889 --> 00:10:42.392
And just so you know,
Chris loves going for second base.

107
00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:57.783
Let's go. I think I can get
my brother to buy us some beer.

108
00:11:05.499 --> 00:11:08.418
- I got the cheez doodles.
- Wait, give me that drink.

109
00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:11.213
Thank you. Leave it, George.
Come on.

110
00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:19.096
- What's going on?
- Jenna's waiting for you in the closet.

111
00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.618
I thought you weren't gonna come.

112
00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:52.295
Where are you?

113
00:11:58.135 --> 00:11:59.469
Oh, Chris.

114
00:12:00.554 --> 00:12:03.640
- It's not Chris, it's Matt.
- What are you doing here?

115
00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:07.727
- Where's Chris?
- He's gone. Everybody left.

116
00:12:11.022 --> 00:12:12.732
- What'd you do?
- Nothing!

117
00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:15.110
- Yes, you did!
- I just went to get my Casio!

118
00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:17.946
- Get out!
- Wait! Jenna, let me talk to you!

119
00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:20.490
- Get out! No!
- Jenna, please, just come out!

120
00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:23.326
I hate you! I hate me!
I hate everybody!

121
00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.496
- Jenna, what are you talking about?
- I wanna be 30!

122
00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:29.958
Just let me play you this song, okay?
It'll make you feel better.

123
00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:35.255
I wanna be 30.
Thirty and flirty and thriving.

124
00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:39.468
Thirty and flirty and thriving.

125
00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:44.639
Thirty and flirty and thriving.
Thirty and flirty and thriving.

126
00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:49.686
Thirty and flirty and thriving.
Thirty and flirty and thriving.

127
00:12:49.853 --> 00:12:53.273
Thirty and flirty and thriving.

128
00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:48.161
Mom?

129
00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:57.796
Mom?

130
00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.260
Dad?

131
00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:51.474
What is happening?

132
00:14:52.434 --> 00:14:57.230
Oh, what is happening?
What is going on?

133
00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:15.123
"Jenna Rink."

134
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:19.878
"Jenna Rink.
Jenna Rink, Jenna Rink."

135
00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:21.838
I live here.

136
00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:29.804
- <i>Hi. Sorry we missed your call.</i>
- Dad?

137
00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:32.641
<i>Well, not that sorry,
because we're in the Caribbean.</i>

138
00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:37.395
<i>So we'll be back on the 18th,
so call us then. Have a good day.</i>

139
00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:40.732
You went on a cruise without me?

140
00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:47.614
Oh, this is a dream.
This is a really weird dream.

141
00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:11.638
- Hey, sweet bottom!
- Oh, my God.

142
00:16:19.062 --> 00:16:23.191
I know you're there! And my parents
are totally gonna be home any minute!

143
00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:26.778
Hey, where's the conditioner?

144
00:16:27.362 --> 00:16:30.323
- You're naked!
- Well, not yet.

145
00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:36.079
You could join me if you want.

146
00:16:38.248 --> 00:16:39.999
Sweet bottom!

147
00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:48.258
Can you hear that music?

148
00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:51.010
Jenna? Can you hurry up
a little bit, please?

149
00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:53.805
He made a commitment.
Jenna? Can you come over here?

150
00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:56.808
I don't care if you have to
grab him by his testicles...

151
00:16:56.975 --> 00:16:59.144
I want him in New York
in 12 hours.

152
00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.604
He needs to be at the party.
Hold on a second.

153
00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:04.607
- Get in the car.
- I don't get in the car with strangers.

154
00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:06.776
Get in the car.
We're gonna be late.

155
00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:09.112
- I don't know you.
- Just get in the car.

156
00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:11.781
- Not with strangers!
- You're being paranoid.

157
00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:15.076
Sweet bottom! Don't make me
come down there and grab you.

158
00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:18.913
Lucy Wyman. He has my number.
Could you please get in the car?

159
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.707
- Jenna!
- We are gonna be late.

160
00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:25.420
Look, he made a commitment. He has
my number. My name is Lucy Wyman.

161
00:17:25.587 --> 00:17:26.796
Just go away!

162
00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:34.262
Honey, I know I'm your best friend,
but the slip dress is a little '97.

163
00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:37.891
- Unless it's retro.
- Are you really my best friend?

164
00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:41.311
- You're pregnant.
- Oh, no! Oh, my God, no!

165
00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:44.481
Thank God. You scared me.
What did you do last night?

166
00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:47.942
See, that's the thing. Something
really strange is happening.

167
00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:50.820
I slept in an apartment
I've never seen before...

168
00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:54.324
and there was a naked man
in my shower and I saw his thingy.

169
00:17:54.491 --> 00:17:56.117
Oh, God. Not his thingy.

170
00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:59.287
Driver, could you please pull over,
since we're here?

171
00:17:59.454 --> 00:18:01.998
- Stop!
- Wait. I don't wanna get out of the...

172
00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:05.168
I don't think you're listening.
Wait, hang on.

173
00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:09.422
Wait, listen to me. I'm 13.

174
00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:12.550
If you're gonna start lying about
your age, I'd go with 27.

175
00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:16.262
Wait! I know it sounds strange,
but some weird dream is... Like that!

176
00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:18.473
Do you hear it? Did you hear that?

177
00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.811
Would you stop being ridiculous?
It's probably just Richard.

178
00:18:24.354 --> 00:18:26.981
- Who's Richard?
- You drink too much.

179
00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:29.025
Richard, your boss.

180
00:18:29.192 --> 00:18:32.862
Brown, curly hair. British. Richard.

181
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:34.697
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, sweet bottom.</i>

182
00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:39.285
You. You. Put on your pants
and stop calling me "sweet bottom."

183
00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:41.538
- <i>Look, baby...</i>
- And get out of my house!

184
00:18:41.704 --> 00:18:43.206
Who is that?

185
00:18:43.373 --> 00:18:46.417
I don't know his name.
I don't know what's happening.

186
00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:49.462
Okay, Jenna. Jenna.
Just calm down, okay?

187
00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:54.217
We have a meeting in 10 minutes.
I'll tell you what to do. Repeat after me:

188
00:18:54.384 --> 00:18:57.887
I am Jenna Rink,
bigtime magazine editor.

189
00:18:58.054 --> 00:19:00.557
- I am?
- Repeat it.

190
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:04.686
I am Jenna Rink,
bigtime magazine editor.

191
00:19:04.853 --> 00:19:06.062
I'm a tough bitch.

192
00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:13.820
- Say it.
- I am a tough bitch.

193
00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:17.323
I'm gonna walk into that office,
I won't let anyone know I'm hung-over.

194
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.993
But that's not the point.
I'm not hung-over...

195
00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:23.705
I'll walk into that office and
not let anyone know I'm hung-over.

196
00:19:23.872 --> 00:19:28.251
Because the future of <i>Poise</i>
depends on me.

197
00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:30.920
<i>Poise?</i>

198
00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:34.382
Oh, jeez.

199
00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:40.930
<i>Poise </i>magazine<i>. Thank you.</i>

200
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.057
Good morning, Miss Rink,
Miss Wyman.

201
00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:46.269
- Good morning. What's her name?
- Who cares?

202
00:19:46.769 --> 00:19:49.272
Jenna. Please don't yell at me,
it's not my fault.

203
00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:51.608
They need a decision right now.

204
00:19:51.774 --> 00:19:53.943
- Just pick one.
- That one.

205
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.653
Love. Knew it. Genius.

206
00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.448
Eminem's on the phone.
He wants a decision now.

207
00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:00.783
Plain.

208
00:20:02.285 --> 00:20:04.787
Peanut. Plain.

209
00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:09.292
There's the dynamic duo! I trust my
executive editors are late again...

210
00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:12.045
because they were out
promoting us at parties.

211
00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:14.923
- You got it, Richard.
- Richard. You're my boss.

212
00:20:15.089 --> 00:20:17.508
That's right, baby.
Who's your daddy?

213
00:20:17.675 --> 00:20:18.927
Wayne Rink.

214
00:20:19.677 --> 00:20:21.304
Morning.

215
00:20:24.933 --> 00:20:27.310
Two words: summer, Saint Barts.

216
00:20:27.477 --> 00:20:30.146
Oh, you're not gonna go
to Fire Island this summer?

217
00:20:30.313 --> 00:20:33.066
- Are you insinuating I'm gay?
- It's a joke.

218
00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:45.161
Is there anything else you
need from me, Miss Rink?

219
00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:49.999
You mean like a favor?

220
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.835
Sure. Like a favor.

221
00:20:53.002 --> 00:20:55.463
- I need to find this guy in New Jersey.
- Okay.

222
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.006
I have his number.

223
00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:04.347
- Arlene, will you leave us, please?
- Sorry.

224
00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.942
Jenna's a little hung-over today.

225
00:21:17.694 --> 00:21:19.696
Rough.

226
00:21:19.862 --> 00:21:22.198
Okay, children.

227
00:21:35.044 --> 00:21:38.923
I wonder which one
Holly Housewife is going to go for.

228
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:42.051
The 10th or the 11th secret?

229
00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:55.398
Seven months in a row now
they scoop us.

230
00:21:55.565 --> 00:22:00.028
I mean, it's like they've got
<i>Sparkle</i>-cams hidden in all our walls.

231
00:22:00.194 --> 00:22:03.239
Richard, we're installing passwords.

232
00:22:03.406 --> 00:22:05.575
We're building firewalls
on all the computers.

233
00:22:05.742 --> 00:22:08.036
- Jenna fired Charlotte yesterday.
- Did you?

234
00:22:10.038 --> 00:22:12.749
I guarantee she has friends
at<i> Sparkle. </i>She always took notes.

235
00:22:12.915 --> 00:22:15.418
- She was a secretary.
- Yeah, whatever.

236
00:22:17.253 --> 00:22:20.882
Our party tonight is now huge.

237
00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:23.176
We need to make
an unequivocal statement...

238
00:22:23.342 --> 00:22:25.553
that <i>Poise</i> is still hot
and happening.

239
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.015
Now, we need a newsstand
circ analysis done immediately.

240
00:22:29.182 --> 00:22:32.977
I also strongly suggest we take apart
our F.O.B., overhaul the B.O.B...

241
00:22:33.144 --> 00:22:36.355
think about new heads, decks
and slugs. Jenna, what do you think?

242
00:22:38.316 --> 00:22:39.776
Can I go to the bathroom?

243
00:23:09.388 --> 00:23:11.766
It's the naked guy.

244
00:23:20.817 --> 00:23:25.655
"Jenna, girl, margaritas anytime.
Love you, Madonna."

245
00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:29.200
I'm friends with Madonna?

246
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:38.793
Here are your messages.

247
00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.129
And your mother called
from Barbados.

248
00:23:41.295 --> 00:23:43.631
My mom called?
I wish you'd told me.

249
00:23:43.798 --> 00:23:46.008
Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Rink.

250
00:23:46.175 --> 00:23:49.178
I thought you said never
to bother you with family calls.

251
00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:52.682
- I did? I said that?
- Please don't fire me.

252
00:23:52.849 --> 00:23:56.102
No, no, I won't. It's not your fault.
I forgot that I said that.

253
00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:58.271
Next time my mom calls,
let me know.

254
00:23:58.437 --> 00:23:59.897
Yes, ma'am.

255
00:24:00.064 --> 00:24:03.860
Oh, I have that information
that you asked for.

256
00:24:04.277 --> 00:24:06.028
Matt!

257
00:24:06.863 --> 00:24:09.157
The phone number
you gave me was his parents'.

258
00:24:09.323 --> 00:24:12.785
I told them that I worked for Visa
and he's in a lot of trouble.

259
00:24:12.952 --> 00:24:15.329
You lied to the Flamhaffs!

260
00:24:15.496 --> 00:24:20.209
He's in the Village.
212 Bank Street, apartment 2B.

261
00:24:20.751 --> 00:24:23.754
- Which village?
- The... Greenwich Village.

262
00:24:23.921 --> 00:24:26.549
Oh, right. Cool.

263
00:24:28.301 --> 00:24:30.553
Wait! Should I cancel
your 2:30 meeting?

264
00:24:35.057 --> 00:24:36.475
Sorry.

265
00:24:38.394 --> 00:24:40.229
Excuse me?

266
00:24:41.105 --> 00:24:42.690
Sir?

267
00:24:45.902 --> 00:24:47.111
Hello?

268
00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:15.848
<i>Yeah, yeah. Hello. Yeah.</i>

269
00:25:16.015 --> 00:25:18.226
Hi, this is Jenna
and I'm looking for Matt.

270
00:25:18.476 --> 00:25:21.687
I don't know if you're him,
but if you lived on Spruce Street...

271
00:25:21.854 --> 00:25:25.524
and if your favorite shirt is a gray
velour one, I need to speak to you.

272
00:25:25.691 --> 00:25:29.695
<i>Hello? Hello? Hello?
You know what? I got none of that.</i>

273
00:25:29.862 --> 00:25:34.283
<i>If you're here from Ming Gardens,
ring twice. If not, I really don't want it.</i>

274
00:25:42.583 --> 00:25:45.002
You're not Chinese.

275
00:25:45.294 --> 00:25:47.755
- Matt?
- Yeah.

276
00:25:49.632 --> 00:25:53.219
You're tall. You're different.

277
00:25:54.053 --> 00:25:57.265
- Yeah.
- You don't know me?

278
00:25:57.431 --> 00:25:59.767
That's weird, because
yesterday you were there.

279
00:25:59.934 --> 00:26:02.311
No, it wasn't yesterday,
because I'm not 13.

280
00:26:02.478 --> 00:26:04.605
- Jenna.
- Yes!

281
00:26:04.772 --> 00:26:07.566
- Jenna Rink.
- Yes! Matt, it's me!

282
00:26:15.032 --> 00:26:17.868
- Hey.
- Oh, Matty!

283
00:26:18.035 --> 00:26:19.870
Come on in.

284
00:26:25.501 --> 00:26:26.836
You still take pictures?

285
00:26:27.003 --> 00:26:30.840
Yeah. You know, it pays the bills.

286
00:26:31.007 --> 00:26:33.175
Hey, Jenna, what are...?
Why are you here?

287
00:26:33.342 --> 00:26:37.054
Matty, I told you. Something
really weird is happening.

288
00:26:37.221 --> 00:26:40.391
Yesterday was my 13th birthday
and then....

289
00:26:40.558 --> 00:26:43.185
And then today I woke up
and I'm this.

290
00:26:43.352 --> 00:26:46.188
And you... I mean, you're that.
You get it?

291
00:26:46.355 --> 00:26:51.110
Are you high? You been smoking pot?
Doing X? Falling into a K-hole?

292
00:26:51.277 --> 00:26:56.073
- Are you doing drugs?
- No. No. Look...

293
00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:00.619
I was sitting in my closet
and I skipped everything.

294
00:27:00.786 --> 00:27:03.914
I mean, it's like a weird dream.
I can't remember my life.

295
00:27:04.081 --> 00:27:06.042
You need to help me
remember my life.

296
00:27:06.208 --> 00:27:08.419
- Me? I can't do that.
- Why not?

297
00:27:09.837 --> 00:27:12.214
I don't know anything
about you, all right?

298
00:27:12.381 --> 00:27:15.217
I haven't seen you
since high school.

299
00:27:15.968 --> 00:27:19.930
- What?
- We're not friends anymore, Jenna.

300
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:23.809
- Matty, you're my best friend.
- No.

301
00:27:26.228 --> 00:27:28.731
Okay. It's cool.

302
00:27:29.732 --> 00:27:31.692
- It's cool.
- Is it warm in here?

303
00:27:31.859 --> 00:27:35.571
It's... Maybe I should open
a window.

304
00:27:35.738 --> 00:27:38.908
I need fresh air and a glass
of water and a fluffy pillow.

305
00:27:39.075 --> 00:27:42.244
Have a seat. I'll get you some...
You want a glass of water?

306
00:27:42.411 --> 00:27:45.039
- You want ice in that?
- I want a fluffy pillow!

307
00:27:45.206 --> 00:27:48.250
A fluffy pillow, coming right up.
Sorry.

308
00:27:51.128 --> 00:27:52.755
You all right?

309
00:27:55.049 --> 00:27:59.887
Jenna, I think you should go back to
your apartment. I'll help you find it.

310
00:28:02.014 --> 00:28:05.810
We went separate ways. We went
to different colleges, different careers.

311
00:28:05.976 --> 00:28:09.105
Well, what about Christmas?
Didn't you wanna see me then?

312
00:28:10.523 --> 00:28:13.692
I think I saw you through a frosted
window once, six years ago.

313
00:28:13.859 --> 00:28:16.070
- Six years ago?
- Yeah.

314
00:28:16.237 --> 00:28:18.322
Wasn't I home last Christmas?

315
00:28:18.489 --> 00:28:21.742
I don't know. Doesn't your crowd
do Saint Barts for Christmas?

316
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:23.702
I don't know.

317
00:28:23.994 --> 00:28:26.122
Is this you?

318
00:28:26.288 --> 00:28:30.292
Yeah. This is where I live now.

319
00:28:36.674 --> 00:28:39.635
Okay, so, nice seeing you.

320
00:28:42.179 --> 00:28:43.764
Good luck.

321
00:28:45.307 --> 00:28:48.018
- Okay?
- Okay.

322
00:28:48.185 --> 00:28:51.147
- Bye.
- Bye.

323
00:28:55.067 --> 00:28:56.527
Matt.

324
00:28:57.987 --> 00:29:00.030
Who is Saint Bart?

325
00:29:06.954 --> 00:29:11.250
The most depressing years of my life.
Our high-school yearbook.

326
00:29:11.417 --> 00:29:12.835
Matt, was I a Six Chick?

327
00:29:13.002 --> 00:29:15.713
Yeah, you were
pretty much their leader.

328
00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:22.094
There's Tom-Tom.
I wonder what happened to her.

329
00:29:22.261 --> 00:29:26.098
Last I heard, you were still good
friends. I think you even work together.

330
00:29:26.265 --> 00:29:29.101
Lucy. Oh, my God, yes.

331
00:29:29.268 --> 00:29:33.355
She's Lucy Wyman now.
She looks so different.

332
00:29:33.522 --> 00:29:37.693
Yeah, she's pretty big into the
whole plastic surgery movement.

333
00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.571
- I was the prom queen.
- Yep.

334
00:29:40.738 --> 00:29:44.366
- And I went with Chris Grandy.
- Yep.

335
00:29:44.533 --> 00:29:48.746
Oh, this is incredible. I can't believe it.
I got everything I ever wanted.

336
00:29:49.205 --> 00:29:52.833
Yeah, Jenna, you got it all.
Congratulations.

337
00:29:55.377 --> 00:29:57.087
It's your phone.

338
00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.014
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, Gramercy calling to confirm...</i>

339
00:30:07.181 --> 00:30:09.517
<i>your limousine pickup
for 8:30 this evening.</i>

340
00:30:09.683 --> 00:30:13.312
My...? Yes, my limousine for 8:30.

341
00:30:13.479 --> 00:30:15.940
I will be prepared to take
my ride at that time.

342
00:30:16.106 --> 00:30:18.234
Oh, can you tell me where
I'm going?

343
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:22.696
- <i>The Palace, 27 Wall Street.</i>
- Thank you.

344
00:30:22.863 --> 00:30:26.367
I'm going to a party in a limo!

345
00:30:27.785 --> 00:30:31.580
Great. Looks like you're back to
your old self. I should probably go.

346
00:30:31.747 --> 00:30:35.125
- You don't wanna go to the party?
- No, I gotta work. Thanks.

347
00:30:35.292 --> 00:30:37.670
Shoot, I forgot you have a job.

348
00:30:37.836 --> 00:30:40.756
- It's kind of cool we both have jobs.
- Totally.

349
00:30:41.006 --> 00:30:45.427
Well, if you decide you want to come,
it's gonna be fun. 27 Wall Street.

350
00:30:45.594 --> 00:30:48.931
Okay, great. Thanks, Jenna.
Bye-bye.

351
00:30:49.598 --> 00:30:51.225
Matt.

352
00:30:52.309 --> 00:30:56.188
- Yeah.
- What if this isn't just a dream?

353
00:30:56.897 --> 00:31:00.067
What if what I wished for
actually happened?

354
00:31:00.943 --> 00:31:04.863
Then you got everything you ever
wanted. You might as well enjoy it.

355
00:31:06.198 --> 00:31:08.117
All right, Jenna.

356
00:31:13.205 --> 00:31:15.708
- Matty.
- Yeah.

357
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.545
<i>- Arrivederci.</i>
- I'll see you.

358
00:31:19.712 --> 00:31:22.256
- Matt.
- Yeah.

359
00:31:23.674 --> 00:31:24.967
<i>Au revoir.</i>

360
00:32:59.103 --> 00:33:02.856
- I'm Jenna, by the way.
- Yeah, I know. I'm Becky.

361
00:33:03.023 --> 00:33:05.067
How old are you, anyway?

362
00:33:05.234 --> 00:33:07.903
- Thirteen.
- Me too.

363
00:33:08.237 --> 00:33:10.322
Used to be.

364
00:33:13.409 --> 00:33:15.244
Why are you talking to me?

365
00:33:15.744 --> 00:33:19.748
- Why not? We are neighbors, right?
- But you usually ignore me.

366
00:33:22.543 --> 00:33:26.088
- I like your shoes.
- Thanks.

367
00:33:26.255 --> 00:33:27.548
I like your dress.

368
00:33:27.715 --> 00:33:31.218
It's because I've got these
incredible boobs to fill it out.

369
00:33:33.595 --> 00:33:35.139
- I like your bag.
- Thanks.

370
00:33:35.305 --> 00:33:38.183
You should come by sometime.
I've got a zillion of them.

371
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:41.395
- Really?
- Yeah, it'd be totally cool.

372
00:33:41.562 --> 00:33:43.772
Hey, Becky?

373
00:33:43.939 --> 00:33:47.234
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah, sure.

374
00:33:47.401 --> 00:33:50.738
Can you tell I'm wearing underwear?
Because I totally am.

375
00:33:50.904 --> 00:33:54.450
I think that's kind of the point.

376
00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:21.268
Try it. It's soft-shell crab.

377
00:34:34.281 --> 00:34:35.824
Thanks.

378
00:34:49.004 --> 00:34:50.339
Hi, Tom-Tom.

379
00:34:50.506 --> 00:34:53.592
Oh, God, no one's called me that
since I had my nose job.

380
00:34:53.759 --> 00:34:56.678
- You had a nose job?
- Yeah, and yours is better.

381
00:34:56.845 --> 00:34:59.139
Anything to drink, ladies?

382
00:34:59.306 --> 00:35:03.185
- An apple martini.
- Can I have a lemonade, please?

383
00:35:03.352 --> 00:35:07.481
Oh, wait. Make it
a piña colada, not virgin.

384
00:35:07.648 --> 00:35:09.858
Do you wanna see my ID?
Totally have it.

385
00:35:10.025 --> 00:35:11.777
There you two are.

386
00:35:11.944 --> 00:35:14.822
Lucy, very nice.

387
00:35:14.988 --> 00:35:17.032
Sort of a dangerous mermaid look.

388
00:35:17.199 --> 00:35:20.202
And you.... Barbie meets Britney.

389
00:35:20.369 --> 00:35:22.538
You look just
"scrum-didlee-umpcious"!

390
00:35:22.704 --> 00:35:24.623
I know. I mean, thank you.

391
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:27.876
Everybody Wang Chung tonight,
right?

392
00:35:30.504 --> 00:35:32.464
Here you go.

393
00:35:36.134 --> 00:35:38.262
Thank you.

394
00:35:39.304 --> 00:35:42.057
- I'm sorry, it's late.
- We're keeping you up, are we?

395
00:35:42.224 --> 00:35:44.685
It's only 11:00. Stay a while.

396
00:35:52.109 --> 00:35:55.279
It's 11:00 on a school night,
and I'm at a party. It's so cool.

397
00:35:55.445 --> 00:35:59.074
It's 11:00 and people are leaving.
This is a disaster.

398
00:35:59.241 --> 00:36:00.701
It is?

399
00:36:00.868 --> 00:36:03.704
Speaking of disasters,
what is she doing here?

400
00:36:03.871 --> 00:36:06.248
- Who?
- <i>Sparkle</i>'s editor in chief, Trish Sackett.

401
00:36:06.415 --> 00:36:08.959
Twelve o'clock and headed our way.

402
00:36:10.127 --> 00:36:14.548
Hi, girls. Our J. Lo issue is selling
like hotcakes. How's yours doing?

403
00:36:14.715 --> 00:36:18.802
My God, are things so bad you had
to come to our party to eat free food?

404
00:36:18.969 --> 00:36:21.013
Put some crab
in your purse for later.

405
00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:24.850
You might want to keep some
of that biting wit for your magazine.

406
00:36:25.017 --> 00:36:28.186
Or you could change the name
to something more appropriate...

407
00:36:28.353 --> 00:36:32.691
like <i>Poison</i> or Pitiful.
Whatever's more pathetic.

408
00:36:32.858 --> 00:36:34.359
You know what?

409
00:36:34.526 --> 00:36:39.740
You are rude and mean and sloppy
and frizzy. I don't like you at all.

410
00:36:40.115 --> 00:36:42.618
Well, fortunately,
I don't care about being liked.

411
00:36:42.784 --> 00:36:45.120
- I care about winning.
- This is delicious.

412
00:36:47.831 --> 00:36:49.666
Ladies.

413
00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:58.133
Do I smell?

414
00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.302
Do I have bad breath?

415
00:37:00.469 --> 00:37:05.265
- Am I malodorous in any way?
- No.

416
00:37:05.682 --> 00:37:09.227
People seem to be running for the exit
like someone set off a stink bomb.

417
00:37:09.394 --> 00:37:10.646
I don't smell anything.

418
00:37:10.812 --> 00:37:12.981
I think he means
the party is a stinker.

419
00:37:13.148 --> 00:37:17.653
A dud. A flop. A zero
on a scale of one to 10.

420
00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.822
Maybe if somebody
played something else.

421
00:37:20.989 --> 00:37:23.492
- Something with a melody.
- Play whatever you want.

422
00:37:23.659 --> 00:37:28.163
All I know is if those people don't
start dancing really, really soon....

423
00:37:29.247 --> 00:37:32.042
Here's to early retirement.

424
00:38:48.243 --> 00:38:50.162
Matty! Matty, come here.

425
00:38:51.079 --> 00:38:55.417
- Hey.
- Matty, come here.

426
00:38:55.584 --> 00:38:57.669
"Thriller." Matty.

427
00:38:57.836 --> 00:39:00.756
Me? No, no, no.
Take that thing away.

428
00:39:01.214 --> 00:39:03.925
- "Thriller." Come on.
- No way.

429
00:39:04.092 --> 00:39:06.011
Come on, man! Go!

430
00:39:06.762 --> 00:39:08.180
Jenna, no way.

431
00:39:08.346 --> 00:39:10.098
Come on, let's go.

432
00:39:10.265 --> 00:39:11.933
I don't remember those moves.

433
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:15.771
I haven't done this in 15 years.
What are you, crazy?

434
00:39:22.652 --> 00:39:24.446
Tear it up, dude!

435
00:39:31.578 --> 00:39:33.872
- Come on, Matty.
- All right, all right.

436
00:39:37.334 --> 00:39:39.711
Okay, here we go.

437
00:39:56.228 --> 00:39:58.313
Go, Arlene!

438
00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.612
Come on, let's go!
Let's go, Jenna!

439
00:40:30.178 --> 00:40:32.347
Go, Richard!

440
00:40:51.449 --> 00:40:54.703
- Jenna. I'm sorry, I gotta go.
- What do you...?

441
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:57.455
- I'm sorry.
- Wait. Don't.

442
00:40:57.956 --> 00:40:59.833
Matt.

443
00:41:00.208 --> 00:41:03.545
Groove on, baby!

444
00:41:08.717 --> 00:41:11.219
I adore you!

445
00:41:34.242 --> 00:41:38.538
- Miss Rink! Miss Rink!
- Your credit card. Your credit card!

446
00:42:19.204 --> 00:42:21.665
- Thank you.
- To being 30.

447
00:42:21.831 --> 00:42:24.751
- I've decided it's gonna be awesome.
- Of course it is.

448
00:42:24.918 --> 00:42:28.296
You're thin, you're hot, you can
get any guy you want, "biatch."

449
00:42:28.463 --> 00:42:32.300
Not to mention, biatch, the hottest
magazine editor in the world.

450
00:42:32.467 --> 00:42:34.135
Second hottest.

451
00:42:34.803 --> 00:42:36.429
- Tied for first?
- Deal.

452
00:42:37.681 --> 00:42:40.016
And speaking of hot....

453
00:42:40.183 --> 00:42:44.271
Mr. Hotty behind you is totally
scamming on you right now.

454
00:42:53.947 --> 00:42:57.659
He is not. He's totally cute.

455
00:42:57.826 --> 00:43:00.578
- Should I go talk to him?
- You're not married.

456
00:43:04.708 --> 00:43:06.334
Good.

457
00:43:16.011 --> 00:43:17.595
Hi.

458
00:43:19.639 --> 00:43:21.933
Could I borrow your ketchup?

459
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:23.768
Sure.

460
00:43:26.479 --> 00:43:28.940
I actually came over here...

461
00:43:29.107 --> 00:43:31.359
because I think you're really cute.

462
00:43:33.028 --> 00:43:37.115
- So do you wanna go out sometime?
- Yeah. Can you drive?

463
00:43:37.282 --> 00:43:41.244
Time to go. What, do you wanna
go to jail? I meant that guy.

464
00:43:41.411 --> 00:43:43.204
The man? Oh, gross.

465
00:43:43.872 --> 00:43:47.125
No more daiquiris for you tonight.

466
00:43:47.292 --> 00:43:50.128
You can never find a taxi
in this neighborhood.

467
00:43:50.295 --> 00:43:52.964
Oh, my God. It's the naked man.

468
00:43:53.131 --> 00:43:55.592
- Hey, beautiful.
- He thinks I'm beautiful?

469
00:43:55.759 --> 00:44:00.180
- Well, he should. He's your boyfriend.
- My boyfriend?

470
00:44:01.931 --> 00:44:04.601
Why is that lady asking
for my boyfriend's autograph?

471
00:44:04.768 --> 00:44:06.061
Thank you so much.

472
00:44:06.227 --> 00:44:08.229
He may not be
the best New York Ranger...

473
00:44:08.396 --> 00:44:10.565
but he's the Ranger
with the best ass.

474
00:44:12.442 --> 00:44:13.735
Jenna?

475
00:44:14.361 --> 00:44:16.738
- Oh, my God. Matt. Hi!
- Hey.

476
00:44:17.572 --> 00:44:19.574
How are you?

477
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.911
I'm sorry about the other night.

478
00:44:23.078 --> 00:44:26.581
- Beaver, is that you?
- Hey, Tom-Tom. How are you?

479
00:44:26.748 --> 00:44:28.875
You lost all your baby fat.

480
00:44:29.042 --> 00:44:32.837
- How does the Beave stay warm?
- Yeah, it's good to see you again too.

481
00:44:33.004 --> 00:44:35.715
I almost didn't recognize you.
Did you get a nose job?

482
00:44:35.882 --> 00:44:38.259
I can't believe you're here.
What are you doing?

483
00:44:38.426 --> 00:44:42.764
I'm... I'm actually... I'm doing
some shopping with my....

484
00:44:42.931 --> 00:44:45.183
Jenna, this is Wendy, my fiancée.

485
00:44:47.435 --> 00:44:49.187
- I'm Jenna.
- Matt told me all about...

486
00:44:49.354 --> 00:44:53.024
his blast from the past.
It was really sweet of you to stop by.

487
00:44:53.191 --> 00:44:56.403
Matty's the sweet one. I don't know
what I would've done without him.

488
00:44:56.569 --> 00:44:59.364
- I'm sure you'll be fine.
- Are you a photographer too?

489
00:44:59.531 --> 00:45:02.325
I see you guys have spent
so much time talking about me.

490
00:45:02.492 --> 00:45:04.869
- Wendy's an anchorwoman.
- Anchorperson.

491
00:45:05.036 --> 00:45:07.831
I do the weather for WWEN
in Chicago.

492
00:45:07.997 --> 00:45:11.876
Matt and I were just talking about him
finally joining me in the Windy City.

493
00:45:13.461 --> 00:45:16.714
- You're moving to Chicago?
- We were just discu...

494
00:45:16.881 --> 00:45:19.217
We haven't really...
Is that Alex Carlson?

495
00:45:19.384 --> 00:45:22.220
Jenna, sorry. Sorry I'm late.

496
00:45:22.387 --> 00:45:23.721
Well, hi.

497
00:45:24.639 --> 00:45:26.391
- Hey. Who are you folks?
- Hey.

498
00:45:26.558 --> 00:45:30.061
I'm sorry. This is my good friend Matt
and this is his friend Wendy.

499
00:45:30.228 --> 00:45:36.317
- Fiancée.
- Right. So weird. And this is....

500
00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:40.905
You're Alex Carlson. Nice to meet you.
You're a great hockey player.

501
00:45:41.072 --> 00:45:42.574
- I'm a big fan.
- Thank you.

502
00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:47.245
You want me to sign your shirt or
your forehead? Now, I don't do butts.

503
00:45:48.329 --> 00:45:49.747
I'm just joshing you. Sorry.

504
00:45:49.914 --> 00:45:54.002
I crack a lot of jokes after we win, on
account of I'm in such a good mood.

505
00:45:56.838 --> 00:45:59.966
Okay, well, we should
probably get going.

506
00:46:00.133 --> 00:46:02.635
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to see you folks.

507
00:46:02.802 --> 00:46:05.930
Nice to see you folks. Bye.

508
00:46:09.684 --> 00:46:12.103
You mind if I steal her
from you for the night?

509
00:46:12.395 --> 00:46:15.356
Nope. I had my eye on
something a little better inside...

510
00:46:15.523 --> 00:46:19.027
so I'll see you guys later.
Have a good night.

511
00:46:19.194 --> 00:46:21.905
Excuse me one second. Lucy?

512
00:46:23.865 --> 00:46:26.326
Should I go to his place alone?

513
00:46:26.493 --> 00:46:30.747
Yeah. Why not?
Go play. You deserve it.

514
00:46:30.914 --> 00:46:33.750
Play. You mean
like games and stuff?

515
00:46:33.917 --> 00:46:40.340
Yeah, games. All kinds of games.

516
00:46:52.727 --> 00:46:55.063
I couldn't wait to see you tonight.

517
00:46:56.397 --> 00:46:58.274
You wanna play a game?

518
00:46:58.441 --> 00:47:01.486
- Do you have Battleship?
- Yeah, I have Battleship.

519
00:47:01.653 --> 00:47:04.572
I'll show you my destroyer.

520
00:47:04.739 --> 00:47:08.576
- I call the red board.
- Well, I call the blue board.

521
00:47:17.085 --> 00:47:18.920
What?

522
00:47:23.424 --> 00:47:26.427
Okay. I know. I forgot.

523
00:47:29.013 --> 00:47:31.182
I owe you one raunchy striptease.

524
00:47:41.985 --> 00:47:43.611
Oh, God.

525
00:47:44.445 --> 00:47:46.864
Oh, gross.

526
00:47:52.787 --> 00:47:58.376
Who's got the moves
on the ice and off the ice, ice, baby?

527
00:47:58.543 --> 00:48:02.880
Wait! Wait! Wait! I don't wanna see
that thing again. Put it away.

528
00:48:03.047 --> 00:48:04.882
Put it away!

529
00:48:05.049 --> 00:48:07.093
God.

530
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:16.644
We can play Monopoly!
We can play Parcheesi!

531
00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:20.398
He didn't have Battleship.
He didn't have any games.

532
00:48:20.565 --> 00:48:22.108
Boys are so stupid.

533
00:48:22.275 --> 00:48:24.986
Becky, it's even worse
than you think.

534
00:48:25.153 --> 00:48:27.780
How come the ones
that you like never like you?

535
00:48:27.947 --> 00:48:32.201
Well, you have to fight for what
you want. Rule number one:

536
00:48:32.368 --> 00:48:34.662
Love is a battlefield.

537
00:48:34.829 --> 00:48:38.958
That's deep. Really deep.

538
00:48:39.125 --> 00:48:42.879
- Good luck with fractions.
- Have fun at work.

539
00:48:44.589 --> 00:48:46.674
To the office, Tom.

540
00:48:48.676 --> 00:48:52.347
"Fifty-seven ways to have an orgasm."

541
00:48:53.264 --> 00:48:56.893
- I didn't know there were 57.
- "Touch-her-there underwear."

542
00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:59.270
No.

543
00:48:59.437 --> 00:49:01.856
"He loves you, but...."

544
00:49:02.023 --> 00:49:04.400
- "He loves your butt."
- Yes.

545
00:49:04.567 --> 00:49:07.320
- "He lies, he cheats...
- So typical.

546
00:49:07.487 --> 00:49:10.406
what are you doing wrong?"

547
00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:18.831
There's no easy way of saying this,
so I'm just gonna come out with it.

548
00:49:21.042 --> 00:49:24.671
The circs are in.
Our numbers are dismal.

549
00:49:24.837 --> 00:49:30.218
We're below 600,000 total circulation.
<i>Sparkle </i>is closing in on a million.

550
00:49:30.385 --> 00:49:36.474
I've come off the phone with corporate,
and they have dropped the R word.

551
00:49:36.641 --> 00:49:38.768
Redesign?

552
00:49:38.935 --> 00:49:40.812
Redesign <i>Poise?</i>

553
00:49:40.978 --> 00:49:43.564
Wait.<i> Sparkle</i> copies everything
we come up with...

554
00:49:43.731 --> 00:49:45.942
and we have to redesign?
That's bullshit.

555
00:49:46.109 --> 00:49:52.073
Well, either we redesign and bring up
our numbers, or they pull the plug.

556
00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:54.575
Richard, redesign is a death sentence.

557
00:49:54.742 --> 00:49:58.579
No, it's not. It's a chance
to have some fun.

558
00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:03.918
Let <i>Sparkle</i> have all our
secondhand, stale, grody ideas.

559
00:50:04.085 --> 00:50:06.796
We'll open up the F.O.B.,
overhaul the B.O.B.

560
00:50:06.963 --> 00:50:10.091
It's time for us to prove
we have some poise left.

561
00:50:10.258 --> 00:50:15.263
Well, I shall be leaving it
to my dynamic duo...

562
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:17.932
to come up with something
utterly fabulous.

563
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:24.355
We have two weeks,
four hours and 30 minutes.

564
00:50:25.022 --> 00:50:28.109
- I have your urgent messages.
- Let's hear them.

565
00:50:28.276 --> 00:50:30.486
Well, okay.

566
00:50:30.653 --> 00:50:33.364
Emily Pratt called
and wanted me to tell you:

567
00:50:33.531 --> 00:50:37.410
"I can't believe you scooped my story
on Vivienne Tam, you backbiting bitch.

568
00:50:37.577 --> 00:50:39.829
That was a new level
of sleaze, even for you.

569
00:50:39.996 --> 00:50:42.331
I hope you die in one
of her casual pantsuits."

570
00:50:42.498 --> 00:50:45.501
Oh, my God, that was so mean.

571
00:50:45.668 --> 00:50:49.922
Miss Lewis called. She said,
"I hope you choke on your own bile...

572
00:50:50.089 --> 00:50:54.051
you pretentious, conniving snake."

573
00:50:54.218 --> 00:50:56.471
- Maybe I should read them myself.
- Good.

574
00:50:56.637 --> 00:50:59.140
Oh, great.

575
00:51:03.311 --> 00:51:06.314
- Miss Rink's line.
<i>- Put that little bitch on the phone now.</i>

576
00:51:06.481 --> 00:51:09.275
Please don't take that tone.
I'm just her assistant.

577
00:51:09.442 --> 00:51:10.651
<i>Tell her to call Todd.</i>

578
00:51:11.903 --> 00:51:17.158
"Sweet bottom, you seem uptight.
Let me come over and give you my...."

579
00:51:25.333 --> 00:51:28.127
- Yes.
- Alex is on line one, Miss Rink.

580
00:51:28.294 --> 00:51:32.131
<i>Oh, gag me. Can you
please tell him I'm busy?</i>

581
00:51:32.298 --> 00:51:36.010
Okay, but he wants to know
what time would be good for dinner.

582
00:51:36.177 --> 00:51:39.597
How about in 10 zillion years?
Ask him how that works.

583
00:51:39.764 --> 00:51:43.017
<i>- Okay, I'll ask.</i>
- Okay.

584
00:51:47.188 --> 00:51:49.357
- Yeah?
<i>- I'm sorry to bother you again.</i>

585
00:51:49.524 --> 00:51:51.859
<i>- Pete Hansen is here to see you.</i>
- Who?

586
00:51:52.026 --> 00:51:55.321
<i>Tracy from the
art department's husband.</i>

587
00:51:55.905 --> 00:51:58.241
Oh, okay. Sure.

588
00:52:08.835 --> 00:52:13.381
I was just dropping off Tracy's lunch,
thought I'd say hello.

589
00:52:15.925 --> 00:52:19.220
You brought Tracy her lunch?
That's so sw...

590
00:52:22.557 --> 00:52:24.559
What are you doing?

591
00:52:24.725 --> 00:52:26.477
What's wrong, pooky?

592
00:52:26.644 --> 00:52:28.354
"Pooky"?

593
00:52:28.521 --> 00:52:32.066
Pukey. You're married,
and to a girl I work with.

594
00:52:32.233 --> 00:52:36.070
Well, that didn't stop us from rattling
some desk drawers loose last week.

595
00:52:36.487 --> 00:52:40.575
So come on.
Lie down and take a memo.

596
00:52:49.166 --> 00:52:53.212
Listen, hire the best photographer,
and I don't want Jenna to find out.

597
00:52:53.379 --> 00:52:55.381
- No. Roger that.
- Okay?

598
00:52:55.548 --> 00:52:59.510
God, what is up with her lately,
anyway? I mean, she seems so lost.

599
00:52:59.677 --> 00:53:03.139
I have no idea. I'm getting
so sick of having her around...

600
00:53:03.306 --> 00:53:05.600
with this crazy new act
she has going on.

601
00:53:05.766 --> 00:53:08.853
You know how she stole
Charlotte's idea and then fired her?

602
00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:11.314
I say we go ahead
with our own presentation...

603
00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.274
and let her fall on her ass.

604
00:53:13.441 --> 00:53:15.651
Oh, God, yeah.

605
00:53:46.974 --> 00:53:49.560
Okay, you're not Cajun.

606
00:53:51.437 --> 00:53:54.649
- Wanna go for a walk?
- Sure.

607
00:54:02.073 --> 00:54:04.325
I still can't believe
you're getting married.

608
00:54:04.492 --> 00:54:07.328
In two weeks.

609
00:54:09.914 --> 00:54:12.833
Is she your soul mate, Wendy?

610
00:54:13.834 --> 00:54:18.965
My soul mate? I don't know if I believe
in those. I think that's kind of naive.

611
00:54:19.507 --> 00:54:23.552
But you get goose bumps
when you're around her...

612
00:54:23.719 --> 00:54:25.763
and butterflies?

613
00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:31.018
No, I haven't gotten crazy like that
about a girl since high school.

614
00:54:31.644 --> 00:54:33.646
Matty.

615
00:54:36.232 --> 00:54:38.734
What...? What happened to us?

616
00:54:38.901 --> 00:54:41.362
I mean, how come
we never stayed friends?

617
00:54:43.698 --> 00:54:45.574
I don't know. I forget.

618
00:54:45.741 --> 00:54:48.160
No, what happened?

619
00:54:49.537 --> 00:54:53.082
I don't know. I can pretty much
peg it to your 13th birthday party...

620
00:54:53.249 --> 00:54:55.876
when you were playing that game.
Spin the Rapist?

621
00:54:56.043 --> 00:54:58.212
Seven Minutes in Heaven.
Everybody ditched.

622
00:54:58.379 --> 00:55:00.715
And that is the last thing I remember.

623
00:55:01.716 --> 00:55:04.385
We don't have to get into this.
It's a long time ago.

624
00:55:04.552 --> 00:55:07.555
- It really doesn't matter anymore.
- It matters to me.

625
00:55:07.722 --> 00:55:09.682
Just tell me.

626
00:55:12.935 --> 00:55:14.520
You came out of the closet...

627
00:55:14.687 --> 00:55:18.024
and I started to sing
my birthday song to you.

628
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:21.235
And then you picked up
and threw at me...

629
00:55:21.402 --> 00:55:23.404
with impressive force, I might add...

630
00:55:23.571 --> 00:55:27.033
the dream house that I spent
three weeks building for you.

631
00:55:27.199 --> 00:55:30.369
And then you just stopped
being my friend...

632
00:55:30.536 --> 00:55:34.415
and you never spoke to me
again after that, ever.

633
00:55:37.918 --> 00:55:40.087
I'm so sorry.

634
00:55:40.671 --> 00:55:43.716
Forget it, Jenna. It was a long
time ago. It doesn't matter.

635
00:55:43.883 --> 00:55:47.428
Matt, stop being so nice to me.
I don't deserve it.

636
00:55:49.096 --> 00:55:51.098
Do you know what
kind of person I am now?

637
00:55:51.265 --> 00:55:54.226
Do you know who I am right now? I....

638
00:55:56.395 --> 00:55:59.231
I don't have any real friends. I....

639
00:55:59.398 --> 00:56:02.318
I did something bad
with a married guy.

640
00:56:02.485 --> 00:56:05.446
I don't talk to my mom and dad.

641
00:56:06.238 --> 00:56:09.241
I'm not a nice person.
And the thing is...

642
00:56:10.785 --> 00:56:12.953
I'm not 13 anymore.

643
00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:19.376
Jenna.

644
00:56:35.893 --> 00:56:37.812
Behind you.

645
00:58:11.113 --> 00:58:13.908
Oh, it's good to be home.

646
00:58:23.459 --> 00:58:25.294
- Daddy.
- Jenna?

647
00:58:25.461 --> 00:58:27.922
What in the world?

648
00:58:28.839 --> 00:58:30.841
- Sweetheart.
- I missed you guys so much.

649
00:58:31.008 --> 00:58:33.427
Are you all right?

650
00:59:37.324 --> 00:59:39.576
Mom.

651
00:59:40.202 --> 00:59:43.163
Do you ever wish you could go back...

652
00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:44.999
like to another time?

653
00:59:45.165 --> 00:59:48.544
I wouldn't mind giving back
some of these wrinkles.

654
00:59:49.503 --> 00:59:51.505
Okay.

655
00:59:52.423 --> 00:59:57.594
If you were given one do-over,
anything in your life, what would it be?

656
01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.519
Nothing.

657
01:00:05.686 --> 01:00:08.731
- Really?
- Really.

658
01:00:08.897 --> 01:00:11.400
But did you ever make
a big mistake?

659
01:00:11.567 --> 01:00:15.070
Or a huge one that could
change your life? What about that?

660
01:00:15.237 --> 01:00:17.990
Well, Jenna, I know
I made a lot of mistakes...

661
01:00:18.157 --> 01:00:20.701
but I don't regret
making any of them.

662
01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:22.786
How come?

663
01:00:23.579 --> 01:00:25.622
Because if I hadn't have
made them...

664
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:28.709
I wouldn't have learned
how to make things right.

665
01:00:37.217 --> 01:00:40.054
I'm sorry I missed last Christmas.

666
01:01:20.969 --> 01:01:23.472
Carrie, I'm heading out, okay?

667
01:01:26.225 --> 01:01:28.102
I'm so exhausted.

668
01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:30.104
- Jenna's working late.
- She has been.

669
01:01:40.906 --> 01:01:42.908
- Hey.
- Hey.

670
01:01:43.075 --> 01:01:46.745
I was gonna stop by your office.
I tried to call you a bunch of times.

671
01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:50.874
- I didn't get any messages.
- I was in a hurry.

672
01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:53.293
But I did try to reach you.

673
01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:57.798
I actually wanted to talk to you
about this whole redesign thing.

674
01:01:57.965 --> 01:02:01.385
I hope you don't mind, but I've been
working on something on my own.

675
01:02:01.552 --> 01:02:04.346
It's really last-minute.

676
01:02:04.513 --> 01:02:08.225
- I hope you don't mind.
- No, of course not...

677
01:02:08.392 --> 01:02:10.853
because I'm doing the same thing.

678
01:02:23.115 --> 01:02:26.410
- Hey, Jenna.
- Hey.

679
01:02:26.577 --> 01:02:29.455
Someone's got
a big photo shoot going on.

680
01:02:29.621 --> 01:02:31.331
- Yeah.
- What's happening?

681
01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:34.418
- Did you bring them?
- Oh, yeah, I got a few.

682
01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:37.087
- What are you doing?
- I'm hiring you.

683
01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:40.466
Actually, <i>Poise</i>
is hiring you for the week.

684
01:02:41.008 --> 01:02:42.885
Here.

685
01:02:49.725 --> 01:02:52.352
This is the first half.
The rest when we finish.

686
01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:55.856
I could really use this, but you
don't need to do me any favors.

687
01:02:56.023 --> 01:02:59.151
I'm asking you to do me a favor.
I love your work.

688
01:03:00.194 --> 01:03:01.945
I hope you'll do this with me.

689
01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:09.536
You know, I've seen your magazine.
My stuff is not your style at all.

690
01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:13.874
Exactly.

691
01:03:14.917 --> 01:03:17.336
Who gets Francis?

692
01:03:17.878 --> 01:03:21.048
There we go.
Okay, let's do it.

693
01:03:21.215 --> 01:03:23.425
Up, up!

694
01:03:23.592 --> 01:03:26.303
- Okay, everybody.
- Okay, everybody, climb up there.

695
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:28.222
Lots of energy.

696
01:03:28.388 --> 01:03:31.808
- All right. Nice. You're the real deal.
- Keep up the flag.

697
01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:36.104
All right. Jenna, this is
your class of 2004.

698
01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:38.565
All right, guys. Ready?

699
01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:52.079
Very good. Very good.

700
01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:22.210
- They're beautiful.
- Yeah, they came out okay, huh?

701
01:05:22.377 --> 01:05:23.754
- I think so.
- Yeah.

702
01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.548
- Do you?
- I do, yeah.

703
01:05:35.474 --> 01:05:37.809
Yeah, it's getting late.
I should get home.

704
01:05:37.976 --> 01:05:40.062
It's getting pretty late here.

705
01:05:40.228 --> 01:05:43.231
You know what I wish I had
right now?

706
01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:45.192
No, what?

707
01:05:45.359 --> 01:05:47.444
Razzles.

708
01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:49.655
Razzles?

709
01:05:49.821 --> 01:05:53.200
I haven't had Razzles...

710
01:05:54.242 --> 01:05:56.078
- in 15 years.
- Remember...

711
01:05:56.244 --> 01:05:59.039
- they're both a candy and a gum.
- That's incredible.

712
01:05:59.206 --> 01:06:02.459
I can't believe they had them.
Okay, don't waste a minute.

713
01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:05.587
It's been a long time. Careful.

714
01:06:07.047 --> 01:06:08.715
Yeah.

715
01:06:11.093 --> 01:06:12.928
What are you laughing at?

716
01:06:13.095 --> 01:06:14.680
I don't know.

717
01:06:14.846 --> 01:06:18.892
Life. Timing. Being here with you,
eating Razzles.

718
01:06:23.563 --> 01:06:26.483
I've had a really great time
working with you this week.

719
01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:27.943
- Me too.
- And everything.

720
01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:29.736
Yeah.

721
01:06:31.947 --> 01:06:33.532
Hey, Matty.

722
01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:36.910
Tell me something.

723
01:06:37.077 --> 01:06:39.204
What color is my tongue?

724
01:06:39.371 --> 01:06:41.623
- What?
- What color is my tongue?

725
01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:43.750
It's red. I don't know. Red.

726
01:06:43.917 --> 01:06:46.086
"Red" red? Or tongue red?

727
01:06:46.712 --> 01:06:48.505
Razzle red.

728
01:06:48.672 --> 01:06:50.173
- Show me yours.
- What?

729
01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:53.218
- Your tongue. I showed you mine.
- I'm not showing you.

730
01:06:53.385 --> 01:06:55.429
Show me your tongue.
I showed you mine.

731
01:06:55.595 --> 01:06:58.765
- I didn't ask to see yours.
- Matty, I need to see your tongue.

732
01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:03.228
Razzle red.

733
01:07:06.857 --> 01:07:08.775
You wanna know a secret?

734
01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:11.903
Yeah.

735
01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:14.406
You're the sweetest guy
I've ever known.

736
01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:21.538
I bet I can still beat you off the jump.

737
01:07:25.333 --> 01:07:27.878
Whoever goes the furthest,
the other owes a drink.

738
01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:30.213
- An Orange Julius.
- Upping the stakes.

739
01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:33.467
And dinner Friday night at 8:00...

740
01:07:33.633 --> 01:07:36.094
at the 24th Street Diner...

741
01:07:36.261 --> 01:07:38.805
to celebrate our redesign
being chosen.

742
01:07:38.972 --> 01:07:41.266
Deal. One.

743
01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:45.312
- Two.
- Two.

744
01:07:46.313 --> 01:07:48.023
- Three!
- Three!

745
01:07:51.151 --> 01:07:52.569
Are you okay?

746
01:07:52.736 --> 01:07:54.863
I should've tucked and rolled.

747
01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:56.656
I'm getting old.

748
01:07:56.823 --> 01:07:58.825
No, you're not,
because that means I am.

749
01:07:58.992 --> 01:08:00.452
Well?

750
01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:08.001
- Hey.
- Yeah?

751
01:08:08.168 --> 01:08:10.128
You got arm hair.

752
01:08:11.755 --> 01:08:14.341
It's never quite got
that reaction before.

753
01:08:47.999 --> 01:08:50.085
<i>It was like it wasn't even me.</i>

754
01:08:50.252 --> 01:08:52.212
<i>Like I had just...</i>

755
01:08:52.379 --> 01:08:55.715
<i>watched us down below, kissing.</i>

756
01:08:57.217 --> 01:08:59.970
Then I just floated home on a cloud.

757
01:09:02.264 --> 01:09:04.724
That is so romantic.

758
01:09:08.186 --> 01:09:10.313
- Look.
- You've got goose bumps.

759
01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:13.108
I totally know. They won't go away.

760
01:09:13.984 --> 01:09:15.527
Do you love him?

761
01:09:15.694 --> 01:09:17.571
Duh.

762
01:09:18.238 --> 01:09:19.990
When will you see him again?

763
01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:22.742
I don't know, actually.
I don't know if I can.

764
01:09:22.909 --> 01:09:26.246
- What? Why?
- It's complicated.

765
01:09:26.413 --> 01:09:28.540
It's a grownup thing.

766
01:09:29.791 --> 01:09:32.794
Well, at least you have
someone to dream about.

767
01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:35.922
Guys don't wanna jump your bones
when you're a metal-mouth.

768
01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:39.175
What is that attitude?
We are young.

769
01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:44.055
Heartache to heartache, we stand.

770
01:09:44.222 --> 01:09:47.684
Love is a battlefield.

771
01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.637
But I like it like this,
with freckle girl and the dog.

772
01:10:24.471 --> 01:10:27.474
- These photos are unbelievable, Jen.
- Okay, here's the dog.

773
01:10:27.641 --> 01:10:30.352
- Francis is the dog's name.
- Okay. What do you think?

774
01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:34.981
Well, I think I'm gonna start reading
<i>Poise </i>for the first time in my life.

775
01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:54.250
No, I got a place I rent in Brooklyn.

776
01:10:54.668 --> 01:10:59.172
That'll work? All right,
I'll see you then. Bye-bye.

777
01:11:03.176 --> 01:11:07.013
Hey. I wasn't expecting to see you...

778
01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:09.975
Wendy. I thought you were
flying in tomorrow.

779
01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:12.727
What, are you expecting
someone else?

780
01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:14.771
No. Hi.

781
01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:16.856
I wanna take you to lunch. Hungry?

782
01:11:17.023 --> 01:11:20.443
Yeah, yeah. What a surprise.

783
01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.195
Okay, where do you...?

784
01:11:22.362 --> 01:11:24.698
- How was your flight?
- It was good.

785
01:11:24.864 --> 01:11:27.701
<i>You can take pictures of
vitamin bottles anywhere.</i>

786
01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:31.079
And I was just thinking that we
should try to resolve this now.

787
01:11:31.246 --> 01:11:36.209
Instead of being a commuter couple
during our first year of marriage.

788
01:11:37.877 --> 01:11:39.587
What?

789
01:11:39.754 --> 01:11:41.715
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

790
01:11:41.881 --> 01:11:44.467
Could you...? I missed that.

791
01:11:45.719 --> 01:11:47.846
- Arlene, do you have any more...?
- Jenna.

792
01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:51.307
My balls, excuse my French,
are in an iron vice.

793
01:11:51.474 --> 01:11:55.228
Corporate are twisting like a bunch
of dominatrixes on steroids.

794
01:11:55.395 --> 01:11:58.732
Now Lucy's presenting her own
redesign. Tell me what's going on.

795
01:11:58.898 --> 01:12:01.317
What is going on is you
will have more choices.

796
01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:05.405
All respect to Lucy, I'm more anxious
to know what you're working on.

797
01:12:05.572 --> 01:12:07.574
- Thank you.
- I'm not complimenting you...

798
01:12:07.741 --> 01:12:09.325
I'm trying to pressure you.

799
01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:12.245
How long until your balls
get totally squished?

800
01:12:12.412 --> 01:12:15.248
Hopefully never. I'm really rather
attached to my balls.

801
01:12:15.415 --> 01:12:17.417
Can they hang in there till 5?

802
01:12:18.293 --> 01:12:20.587
Jenna, you are not yourself
at the moment.

803
01:12:20.754 --> 01:12:25.091
Since when do you keep me out of
the loop? I'm really freaking out here.

804
01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:28.136
- The rest of the prints are ready.
- Goody. Hang in there.

805
01:12:28.303 --> 01:12:30.263
Why does nobody listen
to a word I say?

806
01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:32.849
Arlene, aren't you coming?

807
01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:36.436
Oh, you're invited, are you?
Okay, bye-bye.

808
01:12:36.603 --> 01:12:39.105
Oh, no, excuse me.
Go ahead.

809
01:12:40.023 --> 01:12:41.983
You know, what am I?
I'm just the...

810
01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:45.945
editor in chief. Whatever.

811
01:12:46.112 --> 01:12:50.450
We've gotta go to 23rd, please,
between 5th and 6th.

812
01:12:50.617 --> 01:12:54.120
- It's 29 West 23rd.
- You got it, lady.

813
01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:59.667
The new and improved <i>Poise</i>
will explore the last frontier.

814
01:12:59.834 --> 01:13:02.462
It will go heroin chic one better.

815
01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:04.214
It will OD.

816
01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:07.175
It will kill.

817
01:13:07.342 --> 01:13:10.512
Cause of death? Chicness.

818
01:13:10.678 --> 01:13:16.017
The new <i>Poise</i> will go farther than
any fashion magazine ever before.

819
01:13:16.184 --> 01:13:19.312
It will be deadly serious.

820
01:13:19.479 --> 01:13:22.023
Fashion suicide.

821
01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:27.821
So, what do you think?

822
01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:39.666
Thank you, sir.

823
01:13:39.833 --> 01:13:42.627
- How much time do we have?
- We have two minutes. Hurry.

824
01:13:48.842 --> 01:13:51.010
Jeez. Such a bitch.

825
01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.522
I know this is different.

826
01:14:02.689 --> 01:14:05.316
I mean, from anything
we've ever done.

827
01:14:05.483 --> 01:14:10.155
And I know you might hate it
and think I'm completely crazy.

828
01:14:11.156 --> 01:14:13.867
But I won't care, even if I get fired.

829
01:14:14.033 --> 01:14:18.872
And I don't mean that disrespectfully,
it's just that I've realized something.

830
01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.209
Who are these women?

831
01:14:23.376 --> 01:14:25.086
Does anyone know?

832
01:14:25.253 --> 01:14:27.839
I don't recognize any of them.

833
01:14:32.719 --> 01:14:34.804
I wanna see...

834
01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:38.099
my best friend's big sister...

835
01:14:40.018 --> 01:14:42.687
and the girls from the
soccer team.

836
01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:45.398
My next-door neighbor.

837
01:14:45.565 --> 01:14:48.902
Real women who are smart and pretty
and happy to be who they are.

838
01:14:49.068 --> 01:14:51.529
These are the women
to look up to.

839
01:14:56.409 --> 01:14:59.579
Let's put life back
into the magazine.

840
01:15:00.663 --> 01:15:04.375
And fun and laughter and silliness.

841
01:15:05.585 --> 01:15:10.548
I think we all... I think all of us
wanna feel something...

842
01:15:11.591 --> 01:15:14.928
that we've forgotten
or turned our backs on.

843
01:15:15.845 --> 01:15:20.099
Because maybe we didn't realize
how much we were leaving behind.

844
01:15:26.606 --> 01:15:29.901
We need to remember
what used to be good.

845
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:38.910
If we don't...

846
01:15:39.077 --> 01:15:43.039
we won't recognize it
even if it hits us between the eyes.

847
01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:48.294
I just....

848
01:15:51.506 --> 01:15:53.967
Bravo!

849
01:15:58.137 --> 01:16:00.640
Brilliant.

850
01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:07.105
We will present this to corporate
first thing tomorrow morning.

851
01:16:11.734 --> 01:16:15.488
- So who's this mystery photographer?
- Matt Flamhaff.

852
01:16:15.655 --> 01:16:17.573
Is he Arthur or Martha?

853
01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.409
Matt. He's Matt.

854
01:16:19.575 --> 01:16:23.121
No, no. Is he gay?

855
01:16:23.288 --> 01:16:25.665
Are you gay?

856
01:17:35.943 --> 01:17:37.904
- <i>City and listing?</i>
- Manhattan.

857
01:17:38.071 --> 01:17:41.199
<i>Sparkle </i>magazine on Park Avenue.

858
01:17:42.075 --> 01:17:44.744
<i>- </i>Sparkle <i>magazine.</i>
- Trish Sackett, please.

859
01:17:57.924 --> 01:18:02.220
Jenna, I'm sorry to barge in on you like
this, but I really have to talk to you...

860
01:18:02.387 --> 01:18:04.931
Hey, Beaver.

861
01:18:05.098 --> 01:18:07.767
I mean Matt. I'm sorry.

862
01:18:07.934 --> 01:18:09.435
Old habits die hard, you know.

863
01:18:09.602 --> 01:18:10.895
Fine. Is Jenna around?

864
01:18:11.062 --> 01:18:14.440
Are you here about your photos?

865
01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:17.860
No, actually, I'm not.

866
01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:20.113
I guess I should just tell you...

867
01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:23.533
that Jenna's decided to go
in a different direction...

868
01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:27.912
with a more established
photographer.

869
01:18:28.079 --> 01:18:33.793
She's gonna use the guy who shoots
the official photos of her sweetie pie.

870
01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:37.630
So don't take it personally,
because there's just a little bias.

871
01:18:37.797 --> 01:18:41.300
I'm sorry to be so honest
with you, because...

872
01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:44.137
I think your pictures
are really cute.

873
01:18:44.303 --> 01:18:46.097
It was nice talking to you.

874
01:18:46.264 --> 01:18:49.976
Hey, Matt. While I've got you here,
do you wanna sign a general release?

875
01:18:50.143 --> 01:18:52.478
Maybe we can use your
pictures in a catalog.

876
01:18:52.645 --> 01:18:54.439
Fine.

877
01:19:56.626 --> 01:19:57.877
Hi.

878
01:19:58.044 --> 01:20:01.214
- Jenny, right?
- Jenna.

879
01:20:02.215 --> 01:20:03.466
I was looking for Matt.

880
01:20:03.633 --> 01:20:07.011
I wanted to tell him some really great
news about his photographs.

881
01:20:07.178 --> 01:20:08.387
Everybody loved them.

882
01:20:08.554 --> 01:20:12.266
That's great. I'll tell him when he gets
back. He's out getting his tux.

883
01:20:12.433 --> 01:20:15.269
- His tux?
- I know. Men.

884
01:20:15.436 --> 01:20:17.188
Everything's the last minute.

885
01:20:17.355 --> 01:20:19.732
I mean, hello. We're getting
married tomorrow.

886
01:20:19.899 --> 01:20:24.278
This'll be the cutest little backyard
wedding since I don't know when.

887
01:20:24.487 --> 01:20:27.406
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. I'll tell Matt you stopped by.

888
01:20:27.573 --> 01:20:29.784
- Okay.
- Bye.

889
01:20:39.710 --> 01:20:44.048
We wanna feel something
again that we've forgotten.

890
01:20:44.215 --> 01:20:47.593
Because we didn't stop to notice
how much we were leaving behind.

891
01:20:48.427 --> 01:20:51.806
We need to remember
what used to be good.

892
01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:57.061
You ready?

893
01:20:59.105 --> 01:21:01.023
The meeting's cancelled, Jenna.

894
01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:02.817
What, until tomorrow?

895
01:21:02.984 --> 01:21:04.443
It's over.

896
01:21:06.112 --> 01:21:07.738
It's over?

897
01:21:08.948 --> 01:21:10.908
Lucy....

898
01:21:11.075 --> 01:21:14.287
She took all your designs
to <i>Sparkle. </i>Everything.

899
01:21:14.453 --> 01:21:16.497
She's their new editor in chief.

900
01:21:16.706 --> 01:21:19.250
Your photos showed up
in <i>Sparkle Online</i> last night.

901
01:21:19.417 --> 01:21:21.002
They're in outdoor ads everywhere.

902
01:21:21.168 --> 01:21:23.504
She can't take Matt's pictures.
Those belong to us.

903
01:21:23.671 --> 01:21:26.882
- She can't do it!
- She can, and she is.

904
01:21:27.049 --> 01:21:29.552
She got him to sign this.

905
01:21:36.017 --> 01:21:37.643
Lucy, you stole Matt's pictures.

906
01:21:38.144 --> 01:21:41.439
Oh, which one do you wanna be
today, the pot or the kettle?

907
01:21:41.606 --> 01:21:43.691
If you don't mind,
I'd like to be the pot.

908
01:21:43.858 --> 01:21:46.902
Maybe the kettle. It doesn't really
matter. They're both black.

909
01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:50.615
- What are you talking about?
- I found this in your office yesterday.

910
01:21:50.781 --> 01:21:53.242
Does it look familiar?
It has your name on it.

911
01:21:53.409 --> 01:21:56.537
- You went through my things?
- Oh, give me a break.

912
01:21:56.704 --> 01:21:59.373
How horrible. How terrible.
I can't believe I did it.

913
01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:01.000
What is this?

914
01:22:01.167 --> 01:22:04.170
You can wipe off the "Bambi
watching her mother get shot...

915
01:22:04.337 --> 01:22:07.256
and strapped to the back of
a van" look from your face.

916
01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:09.508
I talked to Trish Sackett yesterday.

917
01:22:09.675 --> 01:22:12.762
It's okay, Jenna. I know all
about your little deal.

918
01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:14.930
It's a sweet little deal, actually.

919
01:22:15.097 --> 01:22:17.808
Editor in chief if you help them
hit a million copies?

920
01:22:17.975 --> 01:22:19.852
- So you'd give them tips.
- Oh, my God.

921
01:22:20.019 --> 01:22:23.898
Not bad. I just wish I would
have thought of it.

922
01:22:24.065 --> 01:22:26.859
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

923
01:22:27.026 --> 01:22:30.154
Only, now I'm taking your job,
you stay here with the magazine...

924
01:22:30.321 --> 01:22:32.448
you single-handedly flushed
down the toilet.

925
01:22:32.907 --> 01:22:34.450
What about Matt?

926
01:22:34.617 --> 01:22:36.994
Why did he sign this?
What did you say to him?

927
01:22:37.161 --> 01:22:39.330
Let's see. I think that I told him...

928
01:22:39.497 --> 01:22:42.375
you had decided to go
in a different direction.

929
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:44.543
Which you are now.

930
01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:51.676
I might have told him something else,
too, but I just can't remember.

931
01:24:04.248 --> 01:24:08.043
George Washington Bridge,
New Jersey.

932
01:24:19.305 --> 01:24:20.639
Jenna.

933
01:24:20.806 --> 01:24:23.642
- Jenna Rink.
- Yeah?

934
01:24:23.809 --> 01:24:26.228
Chris Grandy.

935
01:24:26.395 --> 01:24:28.481
So, what are you doing?
Are you married?

936
01:24:28.647 --> 01:24:32.318
Because if you're single,
I definitely want a number.

937
01:24:32.485 --> 01:24:33.778
We could get together.

938
01:24:33.944 --> 01:24:35.654
I'm still living at home...

939
01:24:35.821 --> 01:24:37.865
- Come on, Grandy! Come on.
- Holy Christ!

940
01:24:38.032 --> 01:24:42.328
This is the tune we first
tangled tongues to.

941
01:24:42.495 --> 01:24:44.830
What's the dude who sings this?

942
01:24:44.997 --> 01:24:48.334
- Rick Springsteen.
- It's Springfield, Grandy.

943
01:24:48.501 --> 01:24:50.169
I'm out of here.

944
01:24:50.336 --> 01:24:53.798
I thought you wanted my number.

945
01:25:18.322 --> 01:25:20.199
I'll take these.

946
01:25:22.201 --> 01:25:23.619
Good afternoon.

947
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:27.081
You remember, Wayne.

948
01:25:27.248 --> 01:25:30.876
It was with the Flamhaffs
at San Ysidro Ranch.

949
01:25:31.043 --> 01:25:33.796
San Ysidro Ranch.

950
01:25:34.463 --> 01:25:38.926
It's so pretty. It's perfect.
It looks great.

951
01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:55.693
Hi.

952
01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:57.444
Hey.

953
01:26:03.242 --> 01:26:07.162
I don't know what Lucy said to you
about me, but I want you to know...

954
01:26:07.329 --> 01:26:10.207
that whoever that was she
was talking about...

955
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.043
wasn't me.

956
01:26:15.713 --> 01:26:17.381
It doesn't matter what Lucy said.

957
01:26:17.548 --> 01:26:21.343
I stopped trusting her after she stole
my Pop Rocks in the third grade.

958
01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:24.930
Matt.

959
01:26:26.891 --> 01:26:32.271
I am not the awful person
that I know that I was.

960
01:26:32.438 --> 01:26:34.732
I don't even know that person.

961
01:26:36.233 --> 01:26:38.861
And I'd like to believe....

962
01:26:39.028 --> 01:26:42.740
I have to believe
that if you knew that...

963
01:26:42.907 --> 01:26:46.952
if in your heart, you really,
really knew that...

964
01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:50.831
you wouldn't be getting ready
to marry someone now.

965
01:26:50.998 --> 01:26:54.710
Unless that someone were me.

966
01:27:07.181 --> 01:27:11.018
Jenna, I'm not gonna lie to you.

967
01:27:13.562 --> 01:27:16.065
I have felt things...

968
01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:18.525
these past few weeks...

969
01:27:19.652 --> 01:27:22.988
that I didn't know I could
feel anymore.

970
01:27:23.948 --> 01:27:27.910
But I have realized
in these past few days...

971
01:27:29.954 --> 01:27:33.165
you can't just turn back time.

972
01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:37.127
Why not?

973
01:27:37.294 --> 01:27:38.921
I moved on.

974
01:27:39.088 --> 01:27:40.506
You moved on.

975
01:27:40.839 --> 01:27:44.093
We've gone down different paths
for so long.

976
01:27:44.259 --> 01:27:46.971
We made choices.

977
01:27:47.137 --> 01:27:49.974
I chose Wendy.

978
01:27:51.809 --> 01:27:54.603
That's her family down there.

979
01:27:55.187 --> 01:27:57.856
We care about each other,
you know?

980
01:27:59.692 --> 01:28:04.196
You don't always get the dream
house, but you get awfully close.

981
01:28:08.158 --> 01:28:10.494
Please don't cry, Jenna.

982
01:28:10.661 --> 01:28:13.539
Oh, I'll be fine, I promise.

983
01:28:43.902 --> 01:28:45.946
Matty, can I have it?

984
01:28:46.113 --> 01:28:47.781
Please?

985
01:28:47.948 --> 01:28:50.242
- You're not gonna whip it at me?
- No.

986
01:28:57.916 --> 01:29:01.253
Look, I won't have you be late.
Just go.

987
01:29:01.712 --> 01:29:05.174
Go on. I'm fine. I'm just crying
because I'm happy.

988
01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:08.427
I want you to be so, so happy.

989
01:29:10.929 --> 01:29:13.098
I love you, Matt.

990
01:29:16.435 --> 01:29:18.228
You're my best friend.

991
01:29:20.856 --> 01:29:23.025
Jenna, I....

992
01:29:24.193 --> 01:29:26.737
I've always loved you.

993
01:31:29.151 --> 01:31:32.070
Jenna's waiting for you in the closet.

994
01:31:43.123 --> 01:31:45.000
Matty.

995
01:31:51.924 --> 01:31:54.218
You really know what you're doing.

996
01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:57.012
Come on.

997
01:31:58.138 --> 01:32:00.891
- Sorry, I forgot my scarf.
- You know what?

998
01:32:01.058 --> 01:32:05.229
You can be the pot and kettle
all by yourself from now on, biatch.

999
01:32:05.395 --> 01:32:06.813
Come on, Matt.

1000
01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:09.233
- What did you call me?
- We're gonna be late.

1001
01:32:09.399 --> 01:32:11.276
- For what?
- You'll see.

1002
01:33:04.788 --> 01:33:06.665
A Razzle, Mr. Flamhaff?

1003
01:33:06.832 --> 01:33:09.209
Thank you, Mrs. Flamhaff.
