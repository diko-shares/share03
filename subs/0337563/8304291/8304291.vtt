830
00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:28.000
the dream house that I spent
three weeks building for you.

831
00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:31.330
And then you just stopped
being my friend...

832
00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:35.410
and you never spoke to me
again after that, ever.

833
00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:41.070
I'm so sorry.

834
00:55:41.650 --> 00:55:44.670
Forget it, Jenna. It was a long
time ago. It doesn't matter.

835
00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:48.380
Matt, stop being so nice to me.
I don't deserve it.

836

kind of person I am now?

837

Do you know who I am right now? I...

838
00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:00.200
I don't have any real friends. I...

839
00:56:00.370 --> 00:56:03.300
I did something bad
with a married guy.

840
00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:06.400
I don't talk to my mom and dad.

841
00:56:07.210 --> 00:56:10.200
I'm not a nice person.
And the thing is...

842
00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:13.940

It's red. I don't know. Red.

999
01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:47.070
Red red? Or tongue red?

-Your tongue. I showed you mine.
-I'm not showing you.

1003

I showed you mine.

-I didn't ask to see yours.
-Matty, I need to see your tongue.

Yeah.

You're the sweetest guy
I've ever known.

01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:39.355

Are you okay?

1019
01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:55.840
I should've tucked and rolled.

1020
01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:57.640
I'm getting old.

1021
01:07:57.820 --> 01:07:59.810
No, you're not,
because that means I am.

1022
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:01.420
Well?

1023
01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:08.960
-Hey.
-Yeah?

1024
01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:11.100
You got arm hair.

1025
01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:15.330

that reaction before.

1029
01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:00.940
Then I just floated home on a cloud.

1030
01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:05.720
That is so romantic.

1031
01:09:09.150 --> 01:09:11.280
-Look.
-You've got goose bumps.

1032
01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:14.090
I totally know. They won't go away.

1033
01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:16.490
Do you love him?

1034
01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:18.530
Duh.

1035
01:09:19.230 --> 01:09:20.960
When will you see him again?

1036
01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:23.690
I don't know, actually.
I don't know if I can.

1037
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:27.200
-What? Why?
-It's complicated.

1038
01:09:27.370 --> 01:09:29.500
It's a grownup thing.

1039
01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:33.770
Well, at least you have
someone to dream about.

1040
01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:36.880
Guys don't wanna jump your bones
when you're a metal-mouth.

What is that attitude?
We are young.

will have more choices.

it's just that I've realized something.

1117
01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:28.800

wanna feel something...

that we've forgotten
or turned our backs on.

1128
01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:21.090
Because maybe we didn't realize
how much we were leaving behind.

1129
01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:30.860
We need to remember
what used to be good.

1131
01:15:40.050 --> 01:15:44.000

No, actually, I'm not.

1152

I guess I should just tell you...

1153
01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:24.500
that Jenna's decided to go
in a different direction...

1154
01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:28.870
with a more established
photographer.

1155
01:18:29.050 --> 01:18:34.750
She's gonna use the guy who shoots
the official photos of her sweetie pie.

1156
01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:38.580
So don't take it personally,
because there's just a little bias.

1157
01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:42.280
I'm sorry to be so honest
with you, because...

1158
01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:45.120
I think your pictures
are really cute.

1159
01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:47.060
It was nice talking to you.

1160
01:18:47.230 --> 01:18:50.960
Hey, Matt. While I've got you here,
do you wanna sign a general release?

1161
01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:53.430
Maybe we can use your
pictures in a catalog.

Hi.

1164
01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:02.170
-Jenny, right?
-Jenna.

1165
01:20:03.210 --> 01:20:04.440
I was looking for Matt.

1166
01:20:04.610 --> 01:20:07.980
I wanted to tell him some really great
news about his photographs.

1167
01:20:08.150 --> 01:20:09.380
Everybody loved them.

1168
01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:13.250
That's great. I'll tell him when he gets
back. He's out getting his tux.

1169
01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:16.250
-His tux?
-I know. Men.

1170
01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:18.150
Everything's the last minute.

1171
01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:20.690
I mean, hello. We're getting
married tomorrow.

1172
01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:25.260
This'll be the cutest little backyard
wedding since I don't know when.

1173
01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:28.400
-Congratulations.
-Thanks. I'll tell Matt you stopped by.

1174
01:20:28.570 --> 01:20:30.760
-Okay.
-Bye.

1175
01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:45.010
JENNA: We wanna feel something again
that we've forgotten.

1176
01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:48.590
Because we didn't stop to notice
how much we were leaving behind.

1177
01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:53.700
-We need to remember what used to be good.

1180
01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:02.000
The meeting's cancelled, Jenna.

1181
01:21:02.170 --> 01:21:03.790
What, until tomorrow?

1182
01:21:03.970 --> 01:21:05.440
It's over.

1183
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:08.700
It's over?

1184
01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:11.880
Lucy...

1185
01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:15.240
She took all your designs
to <i>Sparkle.</i> Everything.

1186
01:21:15.410 --> 01:21:17.470
She's their new editor in chief.

1187
01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:20.210
Your photos showed up
in <i>Sparkle Online</i> last night.

1188
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:22.110
They're in outdoor ads everywhere.

1189
01:21:22.290 --> 01:21:24.450
She can't take Matt's pictures.
Those belong to us.

1190
01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:27.850
-She can't do it!
-She can, and she is.

1191
01:21:28.030 --> 01:21:30.520
She got him to sign this.

1192
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.590
Lucy, you stole Matt's pictures.

1193
01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:42.400
Oh, which one do you wanna be
today, the pot or the kettle?

1194
01:21:42.570 --> 01:21:44.670
If you don't mind,
I'd like to be the pot.

1195
01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:47.870
Maybe the kettle. It doesn't really matter.
They're both black.

1196
01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:51.570
-What are you talking about?
-I found this in your office yesterday.

1197
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:54.220
Does it look familiar?
It has your name on it.

1198
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:57.520
-You went through my things?
-Oh, give me a break.

1199
01:21:57.690 --> 01:22:00.350
How horrible. How terrible.
I can't believe I did it.

1200
01:22:00.530 --> 01:22:01.960
What is this?

1201
01:22:02.130 --> 01:22:05.150

1203
01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:10.460
I talked to Trish Sackett yesterday.

1204
01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:13.730
It's okay, Jenna. I know all about
your little deal.

1205
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:15.900
It's a sweet little deal, actually.

1206
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:18.770
Editor in chief if you help them
hit a million copies?

1207
01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:20.810
-So you'd give them tips.
-Oh, my God.

1208
01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:24.880
Not bad. I just wish I would
have thought of it.

1209
01:22:25.050 --> 01:22:27.810
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.

1210
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:31.150
Only, now I'm taking your job,

1211

down the toilet.

1212
01:22:33.890 --> 01:22:35.420
What about Matt?

1213
01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:37.960
Why did he sign this?
What did you say to him?

1214
01:22:38.130 --> 01:22:40.290
Let's see. I think that I told him...

1215
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:43.370
you had decided to go
in a different direction.

1216
01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:45.500
Which you are now.

1217
01:22:47.610 --> 01:22:52.630
I might have told him something else,
too, but I just can't remember.

So, what are you doing?
Are you married?

1223
01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:33.270
Because if you're single,
I definitely want a number.

1224
01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:34.740

I don't know what Lucy said to you
about me, but I want you to know...

1248
01:26:08.310 --> 01:26:11.170
that whoever that was she
was talking about...

1249
01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:14.000
wasn't me.

I don't even know that person.

And I'd like to believe...

1256
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.700
I have to believe
that if you knew that...

1257
01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:47.940
if in your heart, you really,
really knew that...

1258
01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:51.810
you wouldn't be getting ready
to marry someone now.

1262
01:27:17.210 --> 01:27:19.510
these past few weeks...

1263
01:27:20.650 --> 01:27:23.950
that I didn't know I could
feel anymore.

1264
01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:28.880

in these past few days...

you can't just turn back time.

for so long.

We made choices.

01:27:48.110 --> 01:27:50.940

1272
01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:55.580
