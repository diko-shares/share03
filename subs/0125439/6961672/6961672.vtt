You couldn't help me with an
incredibly important decision, could you?

37
00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:55.485
Is this important in comparison to, let's say,

38
00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.237
whether they should cancel
Third World debt?

39
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.782
That's right. I'm at last going out
on a date with the great Janine

40
00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:02.909
and I just wanna be sure
I've picked the right T-shirt.

41
00:04:02.993 --> 00:04:05.495
-What are the choices?
-Well, wait for it.

42
00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:16.298
First there's this one. Cool, huh?

43
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.802
Yeah, it might make it hard
to strike a really romantic note.

44
00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:23.096
Point taken. Don't despair.

45
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.808
If it's romance we're looking for
I believe I have just the thing.

46
00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:35.275
Yeah, well, there again, she might not think
you had true love on your mind.

47
00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:37.736
Right. Just one more.

48
00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:45.827
True love here I come.

49
00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:55.462
Well, yeah. Yeah, that's, that's perfect.

50
00:04:56.797 --> 00:05:00.091
Great. Thanks. Wish me luck.

51
00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:02.135

<i>never suspecting that this was the day
that was gonna change my life forever.</i>

55
00:05:17.943 --> 00:05:20.904
<i>This is work, by the way,
my little travel bookshop.</i>

56
00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:24.699
-Morning, Martin.
-Morning, <i>Monseigneur.</i>

<i>Which, well, sells travel books</i>

58
00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:31.748

61
00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:47.430
Shall I go and get you a cappuccino?

62
00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:50.559
-You know, ease the pain a bit.
-Yeah. Yeah.

63
00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:53.186
Better make it a half. All I can afford.

64
00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:56.940
Get your logic. Demi-cappu coming right up.

65
00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:25.343
Can I help you at all?

66
00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:29.055
No, thanks, I'll just look around.

67
00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:32.183
Fine.

68
00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:42.152
That book's really not great.

69
00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:46.489
Just in case browsing turned to buying,
you'd be wasting your money.

70
00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:52.245
But if it's Turkey you're interested in,
this one, on the other hand, is very good.

71
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.584
I think the man who wrote it
has actually been to Turkey, which helps.

72
00:06:57.876 --> 00:07:00.670
There's also a very amusing incident
with a kebab

73
00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:03.590
which is one of many amusing incidents.

74
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.342
Thanks, I'll think about it.

75
00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:08.178
Or, in the bigger hard-back variety, there's...

76
00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:11.514
I'm sorry, can you just give me a second?

77
00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:16.686
Excuse me.

78
00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:19.522
-Yes?
-Bad news.

79
00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:21.608
What?

80
00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:24.653
We've got a security camera
in this bit of the shop.

81
00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:26.237
So?

82
00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:28.949
So I saw you
put that book down your trousers.

83
00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:33.828
-What book?
-The one down your trousers.

84
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.374
I don't have a book down my trousers.

85
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.587
Right, I tell you what, I'll call the police

86
00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:46.091
and what can I say, if I'm wrong about
the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario,

87
00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:47.634
I really apologise.

88
00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:52.097
Okay. What if
I did have a book down my trousers?

89
00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:55.225
Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk

90
00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:59.062
you'd remove the <i>Cadogan Guide to Bali</i>
from your trousers

91
00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:02.941
and either wipe it and put it back or buy it.

92
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.735
I'll see you in a sec.

93
00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:08.446
I'm sorry about that.

94
00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:10.615
No, it's fine.

95
00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:14.703
I was gonna steal one
but now I've changed my mind.

96
00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:17.872
Signed by the author, I see.

97
00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:21.334
Yeah, couldn't stop him.

98
00:08:21.418 --> 00:08:24.963
If you can find an unsigned one,
it's worth an absolute fortune.

99
00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:27.799
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

100
00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:29.592
Can I have your autograph?

101
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:32.429
-Sure.
-Here.

102
00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:35.974
-What's your name?
-Rufus.

103
00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:44.524
What does it say?

104
00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:49.195
That's my signature, and above it,
it says "Dear Rufus, you belong in jail."

105
00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:50.780
Good one.

106
00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:54.576
Do you want my phone number?

107
00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:58.246
Tempting, but no.

108
00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:00.248
Thank you.

109
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.503
I will take this one.

110
00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:07.338
Oh, right, right.

111
00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:12.093
So, well, on second thoughts
maybe it's not that bad after all.

112
00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:15.472
Actually it's a sort of classic, really.

113
00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:19.809
None of those childish kebab stories
you find in so many books these days.

114
00:09:21.352 --> 00:09:23.563
I tell you what,
I'll throw in one of those for free.

115
00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:28.526
Useful for lighting fires, wrapping fish,
that sort of thing.

116
00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:34.491
-Thanks.
-Pleasure.

Thanks.

120
00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:15.448
I don't think
you'll believe who was just in here.

121
00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:17.867
Who? Was it someone famous?

122
00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:21.704
No, no, no.

123
00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:25.875
Would be exciting though, wouldn't it,
if someone famous came into the shop?

124
00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:32.173
Do you know, this is pretty amazing
actually, but I once saw Ringo Starr.

125
00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:35.426
-Where was that?
-Kensington High Street.

126
00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.511
At least I think it was Ringo.

127
00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:40.056
It might have been that man
from <i>Fiddler On The Roof.</i>

128
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.392
-You know, Toppy.
-Topol.

129
00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:45.478
Yes, that's right. Topol.

130
00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:51.568
Actually, Ringo Starr
doesn't look at all like Topol.

131
00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:54.362
Yeah, but he was
quite a long way away from me.

132
00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:57.615
So actually
it could've been neither of them?

133
00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:00.160
Yes, I suppose so, yes.

134
00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:04.455
-It's not a classic anecdote, is it?
-Not a classic, no. No.

135
00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:10.837
Another one?

136
00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:16.176
Yes. No! Let's go crazy.
I'll have an orange juice.

137
00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:25.143
-Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.
-See you later.

-Here let me...
-Get your hands off!

142
00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:43.203
I'm really sorry. I live just over the street.

143
00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:46.372
I have water and soap.
You can get cleaned up.

144
00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:49.209
No, thank you.
I just need to get my car back.

145
00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:50.543
I also have a phone.

146
00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:52.170
I'm confident that in five minutes

147
00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:54.839
we can have you spick and span
and back on the street again.

148
00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:57.258
In the non-prostitute sense, obviously.

149
00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:02.472
All right.

150
00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:07.060
Well, what do you mean
"just over the street"? Give it to me in yards.

151
00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:10.855
Eighteen yards. That's my house there
with the blue front door.

152
00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:17.820
Come on in. I'll just, I'll just...

(MUMBLING)

154
00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:24.369
Right. Right.

155
00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:29.499
Come in.
It's not quite as tidy as it normally is, I fear.

156
00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:35.004
But the bathroom's on the top floor.
And the telephone's just up here.

157

straight on, straight on up.

Would you like something to eat?

171
00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:50.038
Something to nibble?
Apricots soaked in honey?

172
00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:52.332
Quite why, no one knows,

173
00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:56.794
because it stops them tasting of apricots
and makes them taste like honey,

174
00:13:57.587 --> 00:14:01.549
and if you wanted honey
you'd just buy honey instead of apricots.

175
00:14:03.426 --> 00:14:06.846
But nevertheless, there we go,
they're yours if you want them.

No.

179
00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:24.364

I'll just take my one chance to say it.

After you've read that terrible book

184
00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:39.796
you're certainly
not gonna be coming back to the shop.

00:14:43.007 --> 00:14:45.968

190
00:15:18.459 --> 00:15:20.920

to write down all your messages?

Okay. Who are the ones
that you didn't write down from?

-No one else?
-Absolutely no one else.

247
00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:56.672
Though if we're going for this obsessive
writing-down-alI-the-message thing,

248
00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:59.675
some American girl called Anna
called a few days ago.

249
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:06.974
What did she say?

250
00:21:07.057 --> 00:21:08.559
Well, it was genuinely bizarre.

251
00:21:08.642 --> 00:21:13.856
She said, "Hi, it's Anna."
Then she said, "Call me at The Ritz."

252
00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:18.110
And then gave herself
a completely different name.

253
00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:21.363
-Which was?
-Absolutely no idea.

254

255
00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:28.954
No, I know that. She said that.
I know she's using another name.

256
00:21:29.038 --> 00:21:32.291
The problem is
she left the message with my flatmate

257
00:21:32.374 --> 00:21:34.460
which was a very serious mistake.

-Try Flintstone.

-Sorry. What?
-I think she said her name was Flintstone.

265
00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:03.989
I don't suppose Flintstone rings any bells,
does it?

deserves a little bit more consideration

Well?

Perfect. Absolutely perfect.

854
01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:06.092
And?

855
01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:12.432
You see, I think you've forgotten
what an unusual situation you two have.

856
01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.478
To find someone you actually love,

857
01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:20.732
who'll love you, I mean,
the chances are always minuscule.

858
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:26.196
Look at me. Apart from the American,

859
01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:28.782
I've only loved two girls,
both total disasters.

860
01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:30.367
-That's not fair.
-No, really.

861
01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:34.662
One of them marries me then leaves me
faster than you can say "Indiana Jones."

862
01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:38.166
And the other,
who seriously ought to have known better,

863
01:04:38.249 --> 01:04:40.377
casually marries my best friend.

864
01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:41.711
She still loves you though.

865
01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:44.297
Yeah, in a depressingly asexual way.

866
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:49.052
I never fancied you much, actually.

I loved you, you were terribly funny,
but all that kissing my ears...

I don't believe it. This is just getting worse.

But I was poor and it happens a lot.

That's not an excuse. I just...

888
01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:18.701
But to make matters worse,
it now appears as though

889
01:07:20.119 --> 01:07:23.998
someone was filming me as well.

890
01:07:24.082 --> 01:07:29.879
So what was a stupid photo shoot
now looks like a porn film.

891
01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:37.178
And the pictures have been sold,
and they're just everywhere.

In fact, I had no idea
if he was ever gonna fly in again.

Listen, it's not often
one has the opportunity to

918

<i>adiós</i> the plates
of a major Hollywood film star.

919
01:09:55.566 --> 01:09:58.277

It just got to the point
where I couldn't remember

01:10:13.126 --> 01:10:15.878
any of the reasons why we were together.

924
01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:19.382

l have thought about you.

927

It's just that any time I've tried to keep

928
01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:47.285
anything normal
with a person that was normal,

929
01:10:47.368 --> 01:10:49.245
it's just been a disaster.

Yeah, no, listen,

to take you through your lines?

"Message from Command,
would you like them to send in the HK's?"

941
01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:28.326
No. Turn over four TRS's

942
01:11:28.409 --> 01:11:32.205
and tell them we need radar feedback
before the KFT's return at 19:00.

Then inform the Pentagon we need

I promised little Jimmy
I'd be home for his birthday,

953
01:11:53.392 --> 01:11:55.770
so could you get a message to him
that I may be a little late?

954
01:11:55.853 --> 01:11:58.648
"Certainly." And little Johnny?

-My son's name is Johnny?
-Yeah.

956
01:12:00.942 --> 01:12:02.568
Well, then get a message to him, too.

957
01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:05.404
"I'll do what I can, Captain,
but I can't promise anything."

958
01:12:05.488 --> 01:12:07.448

Gripping. You know, it's not Jane Austen.

962
01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:17.083
It's not Henry James. But it's gripping.

963
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:19.252
Think I should do Henry James instead?

964
01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:21.003
Well, I think you would be brilliant
in Henry James

965
01:12:21.087 --> 01:12:24.507

966
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:26.425
They're pretty damn good, too.

01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:29.053

in <i>Wings of the Dove</i> saying,

"Inform the Pentagon,
we need Black Star cover."

01:12:31.806 --> 01:12:34.934

the book is the poorer for it.

when it comes to nudity clauses.

985
01:13:57.475 --> 01:14:00.519
You actually have clauses in your contract
about nudity?

986
01:14:00.603 --> 01:14:02.104
Definitely.

You may show the dent of the top
of the artist's buttocks but neither cheek.

988

Or, if there's a stunt bottom being used,
artist must have full consultation.

You have a stunt bottom?

990
01:14:14.075 --> 01:14:17.203
Well, I could have a stunt bottom, yes.

better bottoms than their own.

992

What, the ice cream
or Mel Gibson's bottom?

1000
01:14:43.646 --> 01:14:46.315
Both. Equally.

1001
01:14:46.399 --> 01:14:49.068
But you wouldn't necessarily lick both?

-Right.
-I don't want to interfere or nothing,

Why some of us get lucky, and some of us...

1190
01:31:28.566 --> 01:31:30.360
-Get fired.
-What?

1191
01:31:30.902 --> 01:31:33.905
Yeah, well, it seems
they're shifting the whole outfit

1192
01:31:33.989 --> 01:31:36.700
much more towards the emerging markets.

1193
01:31:37.409 --> 01:31:40.495
And of course, well, I was total crap, so...

1194
01:31:40.578 --> 01:31:43.498
A toast to Bernie,
the worst stockbroker in the whole world.

1195
01:31:43.581 --> 01:31:46.292
I thank you.
And Tony, the worst restaurateur.

1196
01:31:46.376 --> 01:31:49.963
WILLIAM: Tony and Bernie. Both crap.
BELLA: The terrible two.

1197
01:31:50.046 --> 01:31:52.090
In their own special ways.

1198
01:31:54.509 --> 01:31:59.055
Since it's an evening of announcements,
I've also got one.

1199
01:32:01.558 --> 01:32:03.852
I've decided to get engaged.

1200
01:32:03.935 --> 01:32:07.939
I've found myself a nice,
slightly odd-looking bloke.

1201
01:32:09.274 --> 01:32:12.986
Who I know is gonna make me happy
for the rest of my life.

1202
01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:16.823
Well, wait a sec. I mean...

1203
01:32:16.906 --> 01:32:19.451
I'm your brother.
I don't know anything about this.

1204
01:32:19.534 --> 01:32:23.038
Is he...
I don't know, is he financially viable?

1205
01:32:23.121 --> 01:32:24.205
(CHUCKLING)

1206
01:32:24.289 --> 01:32:27.167
He's an artist with brilliant prospects.

1207
01:32:29.919 --> 01:32:31.463
This is a secret
you've been keeping from me?

1208
01:32:31.546 --> 01:32:33.214
BELLA: No. No. I swear.

1209
01:32:33.298 --> 01:32:35.133
By the way, it's you.

1210
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:39.512
Me?

1211
01:32:40.555 --> 01:32:42.265
What do you think?

1212
01:32:43.058 --> 01:32:44.476
Well, yeah.

1213
01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.772
Groovy.

1214
01:32:50.732 --> 01:32:54.986
Excuse me,
are there any more announcements?

1215
01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:57.113
Well, actually, yes.

1216
01:32:57.197 --> 01:33:01.993
I feel I should apologise to everyone
for my behaviour over the last six months.

1217
01:33:02.494 --> 01:33:05.830
I have, as you know,
been somewhat down in the mouth.

1218
01:33:05.914 --> 01:33:08.500
Well, there's an understatement.
There are dead people on better form.

1219
01:33:09.834 --> 01:33:13.421
But I just wish to make it clear
that I've turned a corner,

1220
01:33:13.505 --> 01:33:17.467
and henceforward
intend to be impressively happy.

1221
01:33:22.847 --> 01:33:24.641
(PIANO PLAYING)

1222
01:33:25.016 --> 01:33:27.560
(SINGING SLOW SONG)

1223
01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:42.450
Oh, God, I'm horribly drunk.

1224
01:33:43.576 --> 01:33:44.869
Me, too.

1225
01:33:45.286 --> 01:33:46.621
Come here.

1226
01:33:50.834 --> 01:33:52.836
So you've laid the ghost?

1227
01:33:55.004 --> 01:33:56.673
I believe I have.

1228
01:33:56.881 --> 01:33:59.634
Don't give a damn about the famous girl?

1229
01:34:00.677 --> 01:34:03.721
No. No, I don't think I do.

1230
01:34:05.306 --> 01:34:08.226
Which means you won't be distracted by
the fact that she's back in London,

1231
01:34:08.309 --> 01:34:09.727
grasping her Oscar,

1232
01:34:09.811 --> 01:34:13.857
and currently to be found filming,
most days, on Hampstead Heath.

1233
01:34:14.732 --> 01:34:16.234
Oh, God, no.

1234
01:34:20.196 --> 01:34:22.532
So, not over her, in fact.

1235
01:35:00.612 --> 01:35:01.738
(MAN LAUGHING)

1236
01:35:06.242 --> 01:35:08.286
-Can I help you?
-Yeah.

1237
01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:10.705
I'm looking for Anna Scott.

1238
01:35:10.788 --> 01:35:13.166
-Does she know you're coming?
-No.

1239
01:35:13.291 --> 01:35:15.460
No, she doesn't.

1240
01:35:15.543 --> 01:35:17.462
I'm afraid I can't let you through, sir.

1241
01:35:17.545 --> 01:35:22.008
Right. I mean, I am actually a friend.
I'm not a lunatic.

1242
01:35:23.927 --> 01:35:27.096
-But no, you basically...
-Can't let you through, sir.

1243
01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:10.265
Well, this is...

1244
01:36:10.348 --> 01:36:13.184
I only found out you were here yesterday.

1245
01:36:14.477 --> 01:36:17.438
-Well, I was going to call, but I...
-WOMAN: Anna.

1246
01:36:17.522 --> 01:36:18.564
Yes.

1247
01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:22.110
Things aren't going very well
and it's our last day.

1248
01:36:22.193 --> 01:36:24.612
Absolutely, yeah, you're clearly very busy.

1249
01:36:24.696 --> 01:36:30.034
But if you could wait,
there are things to say.

1250
01:36:35.039 --> 01:36:36.165
Okay.

1251
01:36:38.543 --> 01:36:41.170
Drink tea. There's lots of tea.

1252
01:36:48.553 --> 01:36:50.388
Come and have a look.

1253
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:56.561
Are you a fan of Henry James?

1254
01:36:57.228 --> 01:36:59.939
-This is a Henry James film?
-Yeah.

1255
01:37:08.573 --> 01:37:09.657
This is Harry.

1256
01:37:09.741 --> 01:37:13.036
He'll give you a pair of headphones,
so you can hear the dialogue.

1257
01:37:13.119 --> 01:37:14.704
-Thank you very much.
-No problem.

1258
01:37:14.787 --> 01:37:18.750
-Hi.
-Hi, here we go. Volume's on the side.

1259
01:37:18.916 --> 01:37:21.210
-There. Have a seat.
-Thank you.

1260
01:37:29.802 --> 01:37:33.097
MAN: <i>We are living in cloud cuckoo land.
We'll never get this done today.</i>

1261
01:37:33.181 --> 01:37:35.016
ANNA: <i>Well, we've got to.
I have to be in New York on Thursday.</i>

1262
01:37:35.099 --> 01:37:36.768
Stop showing off.

1263
01:37:38.061 --> 01:37:39.812
God, that's an enormous arse.

1264
01:37:39.896 --> 01:37:41.606
ANNA: <i>I'm not listening.</i>

1265
01:37:41.731 --> 01:37:43.691
<i>No, but seriously, it's not fair.</i>

1266
01:37:43.775 --> 01:37:46.694
So many tragic young teenagers
with anorexia,

1267
01:37:46.778 --> 01:37:48.863
and that girl has an arse she could
perfectly well share around

1268
01:37:48.946 --> 01:37:52.492
with at least 10 other women,
and still be big bottomed.

1269
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:54.994
I would think,
looking at something nice like that,

1270
01:37:55.078 --> 01:38:01.042
you and your bony little excuse for an arse
would be well advised to keep quiet.

1271
01:38:02.168 --> 01:38:04.379
Now, down to business,
the end of the scene.

1272
01:38:04.462 --> 01:38:07.799
I ask you when you're telling everyone,
and you say...

1273
01:38:08.966 --> 01:38:11.302
"Tomorrow will be soon enough."

1274
01:38:11.594 --> 01:38:14.097
And then I... Right, okay.

1275
01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:18.184
So who was that rather diffident chap
I saw you talking to round the back?

1276
01:38:18.267 --> 01:38:19.477
No one.

1277
01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:23.689
Just some guy from the past.

1278
01:38:24.315 --> 01:38:28.986
It's a bit of an awkward situation really.
I don't know what he's doing here.

1279
01:38:45.336 --> 01:38:46.671
Of course.

1280
01:38:48.548 --> 01:38:49.882
(SIGHING)

1281
01:38:53.386 --> 01:38:57.348
-Thanks, I've got to...
-Any time.

1282
01:39:07.859 --> 01:39:11.195
MAN: <i>Ladies and gentlemen, can we have
you all on your first marks, please.</i>

1283
01:39:11.279 --> 01:39:13.030
<i>On your first marks.</i>

1284
01:39:26.210 --> 01:39:28.921
I do hate to disturb you
whilst you're cooking the books,

1285
01:39:29.046 --> 01:39:31.382
but there's a delivery for you.

1286
01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:34.927
Martin, really, can't you just do it yourself?

1287
01:39:35.011 --> 01:39:38.473
But you see, this is not for the shop.
This is for you.

1288
01:39:40.850 --> 01:39:42.101
Right, okay.

1289
01:39:42.185 --> 01:39:47.106
Now tell me, if I employed a wet rag,
would I have to pay it as much as I pay you?

1290
01:39:50.818 --> 01:39:51.819
Hi.

1291
01:39:53.905 --> 01:39:55.072
Hello.

1292
01:39:55.948 --> 01:39:57.950
You disappeared.

1293
01:39:58.034 --> 01:40:01.287
Yeah. Yeah, I had to leave.

1294
01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:04.165
I didn't want to disturb.

1295
01:40:04.248 --> 01:40:06.250
How have you been?

1296
01:40:06.334 --> 01:40:07.585
Fine. Fine.

1297
01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:09.128
I don't know, everything much the same,
you know.

1298
01:40:09.212 --> 01:40:13.007
When they change the law,
Spike and I wiII marry immediately.

1299
01:40:13.591 --> 01:40:17.345
Whereas you, I've watched in wonder.
Awards, glory.

1300
01:40:17.637 --> 01:40:21.349
Oh, no, it's all nonsense, believe me.

1301
01:40:21.933 --> 01:40:26.521
I'd no idea how much nonsense it was,
but nonsense it all is.

1302
01:40:29.857 --> 01:40:33.945
Well, yesterday was our last day of filming,

1303
01:40:35.404 --> 01:40:36.614
so I'm leaving.

1304
01:40:38.491 --> 01:40:39.700
But...

1305
01:40:42.912 --> 01:40:47.375
I brought this for you from home.
So I thought I'd give it to you.

1306
01:40:50.127 --> 01:40:51.462
Thank you.

1307
01:40:54.090 --> 01:40:55.800
-Shall I...
-Oh, no, don't open it now,

1308
01:40:55.883 --> 01:40:57.635
I'll be embarrassed.

1309
01:40:59.804 --> 01:41:03.641
Well, thank you. I don't know
what it's for, but thanks anyway.

1310
01:41:03.724 --> 01:41:07.603
I actually had it in my apartment.
I thought you...

1311
01:41:10.606 --> 01:41:12.233
But when it came to it,

1312
01:41:12.316 --> 01:41:15.820
I didn't know how to call,
having behaved so badly.

1313
01:41:16.529 --> 01:41:17.738
Twice.

1314
01:41:19.824 --> 01:41:22.868
So it's just been sitting in the hotel.

1315
01:41:24.328 --> 01:41:27.957
Then you came, and I figured...

1316
01:41:32.336 --> 01:41:33.879
The thing is...

1317
01:41:35.339 --> 01:41:36.882
The thing is...

1318
01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:41.721
What? What is the thing?

1319
01:41:43.681 --> 01:41:47.101
Don't even think about it.
Go away, immediately. Go away.

1320
01:41:47.184 --> 01:41:49.186
Right. Sorry.

1321
01:41:53.608 --> 01:41:55.234
You were saying?

1322
01:41:57.612 --> 01:41:58.696
Yes.

1323
01:42:01.407 --> 01:42:05.703
I have to go away today,
but I wondered if I didn't,

1324
01:42:07.705 --> 01:42:10.708
whether you might let me see you a little,

1325
01:42:11.876 --> 01:42:14.629
or a lot, maybe.

1326
01:42:18.299 --> 01:42:20.635
See if you could like me again.

1327
01:42:21.886 --> 01:42:23.929
But yesterday that actor asked you
who I was

1328
01:42:24.013 --> 01:42:26.682
and you just dismissed me out of hand.

1329
01:42:27.808 --> 01:42:29.060
I heard.

1330
01:42:30.978 --> 01:42:33.981
You had a microphone, I had headphones.

1331
01:42:34.065 --> 01:42:36.484
What, you expect me
to tell the truth about my life

1332
01:42:36.567 --> 01:42:39.236
to the most indiscreet man in England?

1333
01:42:41.572 --> 01:42:44.533
Excuse me. It's your mother on the phone.

1334
01:42:48.079 --> 01:42:50.498
Will you tell her I'll ring her back, please?

1335
01:42:50.581 --> 01:42:53.459
I've actually tried that tack,
but she said you've said that once before,

1336
01:42:53.542 --> 01:42:55.378
and it's now been about 24 hours

1337
01:42:55.461 --> 01:42:58.881
and the foot that was purple
is now sort of blackish in colour and...

1338
01:42:58.964 --> 01:43:02.426
Right, right, yeah. Perfect timing as ever.

1339
01:43:04.804 --> 01:43:07.139
Martin, hold the fort a second.

1340
01:43:08.933 --> 01:43:10.476
Yes, all right.

1341
01:43:14.939 --> 01:43:16.440
(MARTIN STUTTERING)

1342
01:43:16.982 --> 01:43:22.196
Could I just say, I thought <i>Ghost</i>
was the most wonderful film.

1343
01:43:24.073 --> 01:43:25.533
Is that right?

1344
01:43:25.616 --> 01:43:26.826
Oh, yes.

1345
01:43:31.664 --> 01:43:36.919
I've always wondered
what Patrick Swayze's like in real life.

1346
01:43:38.212 --> 01:43:40.715
I can't say that I know Patrick all that well.

1347
01:43:40.798 --> 01:43:43.384
What, he wasn't that friendly during filming?

1348
01:43:43.467 --> 01:43:48.764
Well, I'm sure he was friendly to Demi Moore
who acted with him in <i>Ghost.</i>

1349
01:43:52.977 --> 01:43:54.645
Oh, right. Sorry.

1350
01:43:55.521 --> 01:43:58.566
Right. Always been a bit of an ass.

1351
01:44:02.153 --> 01:44:05.906
Anyway, well, it was lovely to meet you.

1352
01:44:06.031 --> 01:44:11.120
I'm a huge fan of yours.
And Demi's of course.

1353
01:44:14.248 --> 01:44:15.916
Sorry about that.

1354
01:44:17.084 --> 01:44:18.169
That's fine.

1355
01:44:18.252 --> 01:44:22.673
