1
00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:52.468
Come, sorrow.
We welcome thee.

2
00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.972
Let us join in grief,
rejoice in despair

3
00:00:56.973 --> 00:01:00.267
and honor
the fortunate dead.

4
00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:02.395
Dearly beloved.

5
00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:07.734
Shh!

6
00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:49.776
Good show, old man.

7
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.819
Gomez.

8
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.694
<i>Cara mia?</i>

9
00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:56.449
Marvelous news.
I'm going to have a baby

10
00:01:57.408 --> 00:01:58.827
right now.

11
00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:07.084
Nurse, how close
are the contractions?

12
00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:08.418
Every 15 seconds, Doctor.

13
00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.170
Are you
in unbearable pain?

14
00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:13.967
Is it inhuman?
My darling, is it torture?

15
00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:15.760
<i>Oui.</i>

16
00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:21.974
And then Mommy kissed
Daddy, and the angel told the stork

17
00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:24.059
and the stork flew down
from heaven

18
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.939
and left a diamond under a
leaf in the cabbage patch

19
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.025
and the diamond turned
into a baby.

20
00:02:32.026 --> 00:02:35.279
Our parents are having
a baby, too.

21
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.198
They had sex.

22
00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:40.409
Push, Mrs. Addams.

23
00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:43.496
- Forceps!
- Forceps.

24
00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:46.249
Forceps.

25
00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.463
Mrs. Addams,
would you like anesthesia?

26
00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:56.508
No, thank you.
But do ask the children.

27
00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.261
<i>Cara mia.</i>

28
00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:00.429
<i>Mon cher.</i>

29
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.348
Mrs. Addams, the baby?

30
00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:03.473
<i>Pardon.</i>

31
00:03:03.474 --> 00:03:06.686
- It's a boy.
- It's a girl.

32
00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:09.354
- Gomez!
- What news?

33
00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:11.024
Father,
what is it?

34
00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:12.942
It's an Addams!

35
00:03:56.653 --> 00:04:00.322
I've arranged a little
surprise, my dearest.

36
00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.367
I hope you like it.

37
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.931
Oh, Gomez, it's dark,
it's depressing, it's desolate.

38
00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:29.434
- It says, "toddler."
- It's a dream.

39
00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:31.521
Come,<i>cara mia.</i>

40
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.109
The Addams' cradle.

41
00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:52.791
Welcome home, my son.

42
00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:55.961
That's not true.

43
00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.170
It is so.
Everyone knows it.

44
00:04:57.171 --> 00:05:01.633
When you have a new baby,
one of the other children has to die.

45
00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:03.969
- Really?
- It's a tradition.

46
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.805
One of us has to go.

47
00:05:06.597 --> 00:05:07.431
Which one?

48
00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:10.852
Well, they only
need one boy.

49
00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:15.981
He has
my father's eyes.

50
00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:19.152
Gomez, take those
out of his mouth.

51
00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.447
A baby
in the house.

52
00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:27.117
It's about time.
Hey, kiddo.

53
00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:31.455
Did you see that?

54
00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.918
He's a real devil.

55
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.387
Pugsley, the baby weighs
10 pounds.

56
00:05:47.388 --> 00:05:49.306
The cannonball
weighs 20 pounds.

57
00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:51.641
Which will hit
the stone walkway first?

58
00:05:51.642 --> 00:05:55.730
- I'm still on fractions.
- Which do you think?

59
00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:56.646
The cannonball?

60
00:05:56.647 --> 00:06:00.109
Very good.
But which one will bounce?

61
00:06:01.652 --> 00:06:02.527
The baby?

62
00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:05.198
There's only one way
to find out.

63
00:06:05.406 --> 00:06:06.866
Ready?

64
00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:12.371
One, two, three.

65
00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.541
What a glorious evening.

66
00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.167
Rain.

67
00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:25.467
<i>Cara mia.</i>

68
00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:26.886
Oh, dear.

69
00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:35.227
Children,
why do you hate the baby?

70
00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:36.520
We don't hate him.

71
00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:38.355
We just want
to play with him.

72
00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:39.564
Especially his head.

73
00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:43.485
Children, do you think we love
the baby more than we love you?

74
00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:44.403
- Yes.
- Yes.

75
00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.363
Do you think that when
a new baby arrives

76
00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:48.949
one of the other children
has to die?

77
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:49.825
- Yes.
- Yes.

78
00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:52.787
Well,
that's just not true.

79
00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:55.831
Not anymore.

80
00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:58.542
It's just sibling rivalry.

81
00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:02.754
Gomez, do you remember
what we were like?

82
00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:05.215
- I hated you!
- I despised you.

83
00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:08.885
I choked him
until he lost consciousness

84
00:07:08.886 --> 00:07:11.221
and had to be put
on a respirator.

85
00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:11.930
I tied him to a tree

86
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:15.767
and pulled out four
of his permanent teeth.

87
00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:16.852
When he was asleep,

88
00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:21.148
I opened his skull
and removed his brains.

89
00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:22.774
You did?

90
00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:28.865
Brother!

91
00:07:30.074 --> 00:07:31.534
Brother!

92
00:07:42.086 --> 00:07:44.421
Children, you see?

93
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:12.950
"Death! Death to the enemies
of the people of the Republic."

94
00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:14.910
Hurrah!

95
00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:16.870
Justice is served.

96
00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:19.123
Bring forward
the evil one.

97
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.855
You have betrayed
the people of France.

98
00:08:43.856 --> 00:08:46.024
You are evil incarnate.

99
00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:47.484
How do you plead?

100
00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:49.444
Guilty.

101
00:08:49.445 --> 00:08:51.988
Guilty by her
own admission.

102
00:08:51.989 --> 00:08:53.490
The sentence is death.

103
00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:57.245
Executioner,
place her on the block.

104
00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:11.217
One,

105
00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:12.259
two...

106
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.136
Children,
what are you doing in there?

107
00:09:15.137 --> 00:09:17.097
- Playing!
- Playing!

108
00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:18.724
Three!

109
00:09:22.144 --> 00:09:24.397
Woe to the Republic.

110
00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:27.315
Look at you.

111
00:09:27.316 --> 00:09:30.695
Midnight, moonlight,

112
00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:33.030
surrounded by death.

113
00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:35.241
It's been too long.

114
00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:37.200
Do it!

115
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:37.909
Hold him still!

116
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.830
You missed.

117
00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:46.918
Here, catch!

118
00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:48.253
I don't want him!

119
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.549
One house,
three children.

120
00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:52.924
So many windows.

121
00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:55.594
My darling,
it's you I'm worried about.

122
00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:58.138
The stress,
all this squabbling.

123
00:09:58.139 --> 00:09:58.763
Oh, I'll be fine.

124
00:09:58.764 --> 00:10:02.225
I'm just like any modern woman
trying to have it all.

125
00:10:02.226 --> 00:10:04.686
Loving husband, a family.

126
00:10:04.687 --> 00:10:07.063
It's just I wish
I had more time

127
00:10:07.064 --> 00:10:12.111
to seek out the dark forces
and join their hellish crusade.

128
00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:13.486
That's all.

129
00:10:13.487 --> 00:10:17.282
You can. You shall.
So it must be.

130
00:10:19.243 --> 00:10:20.702
But how?

131
00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:22.912
Children, as your new nanny,

132
00:10:22.913 --> 00:10:28.502
I know that we're all concerned
about the environment.

133
00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:30.253
So, this morning,

134
00:10:30.254 --> 00:10:34.300
let's discuss how
to prevent forest fires.

135
00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:36.093
Prevent them?

136
00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:40.305
All right, children,
I've had it up to here.

137
00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:44.393
Now you just answer
one simple question.

138
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.979
Where is that baby?

139
00:10:47.229 --> 00:10:48.438
Which part?

140
00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:49.522
<i>Hello, kiddies.</i>

141
00:10:49.523 --> 00:10:53.485
I'm Polly the puppet.
What shall we do today?

142
00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:57.657
I know.
Let's all clean our rooms.

143
00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:00.450
Hello, Polly.

144
00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:05.665
I'll clean my room in exchange
for your immortal soul.

145
00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:16.132
Hi. Addams residence?

146
00:11:16.133 --> 00:11:18.511
Ooh. It's old.

147
00:11:21.597 --> 00:11:23.182
And big.

148
00:11:23.599 --> 00:11:25.226
Lurch.

149
00:11:25.726 --> 00:11:30.397
Hi! Hi. I'm Debbie
Jellinsky from the agency.

150
00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:31.439
The agency?

151
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.150
But they claimed
no one else was available.

152
00:11:34.151 --> 00:11:35.568
They suggested a Doberman.

153
00:11:35.569 --> 00:11:38.863
Surprise!
I've been out of town.

154
00:11:38.864 --> 00:11:39.906
Are you the mom?

155
00:11:39.907 --> 00:11:41.616
I am Mrs. Addams.

156
00:11:41.617 --> 00:11:45.662
I love your dress.
It's so tight.

157
00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:47.123
Thank you.

158
00:11:47.748 --> 00:11:48.873
Gomez.

159
00:11:48.874 --> 00:11:52.252
I believe we may have
a new nanny,

160
00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:53.838
Miss Jellinsky.

161
00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:55.297
Deb.

162
00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:58.216
Isn't he a lady-killer?

163
00:11:58.217 --> 00:11:59.927
Acquitted.

164
00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:01.594
I can show you
all my references

165
00:12:01.595 --> 00:12:03.680
so you know
I'm not a homicidal maniac.

166
00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:07.058
- Of course you're not.
- You're too young.

167
00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:10.311
Welcome to our home.

168
00:12:10.312 --> 00:12:12.731
There's a belfry,
a swamp

169
00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:15.150
and the dungeon
down below.

170
00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:17.695
- Cable?
- Of course.

171
00:12:18.237 --> 00:12:20.239
Debbie.

172
00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:26.619
Oh, is that
the little critter?

173
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.954
Oh, no.
This is our baby.

174
00:12:27.955 --> 00:12:32.208
He's adorable. He's perfect.
What's his name?

175
00:12:32.209 --> 00:12:32.751
It was agony.

176
00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:36.212
We went through all the books,
all the usual baby names.

177
00:12:36.213 --> 00:12:38.047
- Lucifer.
- Benito.

178
00:12:38.048 --> 00:12:38.340
Mao.

179
00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:39.632
And then
we came to our senses.

180
00:12:39.633 --> 00:12:43.845
Something simple,
something a child could live with.

181
00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:45.389
Pubert.

182
00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.266
Pubert.

183
00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:48.683
I like it.

184
00:12:48.684 --> 00:12:50.560
It's filthy.

185
00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:51.686
May I?

186
00:12:51.687 --> 00:12:53.104
Your dress,
is it flammable?

187
00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:57.359
You've had your shots,
measles, mumps, rabies?

188
00:13:01.864 --> 00:13:03.365
Oh!

189
00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:08.328
Oh, I just adore
little babies.

190
00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:10.121
I just want to grab 'em
and squeeze 'em

191
00:13:10.122 --> 00:13:13.792
till there's not a breath left
in their tiny, little bodies.

192
00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:17.338
Hello, Pubert.

193
00:13:17.546 --> 00:13:19.298
I love you.

194
00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:27.722
Children, this is Miss
Jellinsky, our new nanny.

195
00:13:27.723 --> 00:13:28.807
What do we say?

196
00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:31.977
Be afraid.
Be very afraid.

197
00:13:33.729 --> 00:13:34.646
Look at you,

198
00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:39.317
all cooped up in this house
with a new baby.

199
00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:41.946
That's not easy, is it?

200
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:42.987
No.

201
00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:47.660
Why, I bet sometimes you wish it
was still just the two of you.

202
00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:49.954
Or less.

203
00:13:50.454 --> 00:13:52.497
Well, don't you worry.

204
00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:56.335
Everything's going to be
just fine.

205
00:13:58.003 --> 00:13:59.087
I love them.

206
00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:03.716
Thing, stop that.

207
00:14:03.717 --> 00:14:05.344
He likes you.

208
00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:15.687
I'm good with my hands.

209
00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:19.983
What a wonderful family.

210
00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:24.780
Although there's one fellow
I haven't met yet.

211
00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:26.573
Hi, there, mister.

212
00:14:27.741 --> 00:14:29.075
- Your nephew?
- My brother.

213
00:14:29.076 --> 00:14:32.078
- No!
- Fester, come out here.

214
00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:33.037
He's very shy.

215
00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:37.625
Fester, this is Miss
Jellinsky, our new nanny.

216
00:14:37.626 --> 00:14:39.712
Hello, Fester.

217
00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:45.174
These Addams men,
where do you find them?

218
00:14:45.175 --> 00:14:47.136
It has to be damp.

219
00:14:48.095 --> 00:14:49.178
I can't wait.

220
00:14:49.179 --> 00:14:51.765
I'll start first thing
tomorrow.

221
00:14:54.935 --> 00:14:57.229
Why not tonight?

222
00:15:04.945 --> 00:15:06.821
Good night, Debbie.

223
00:15:06.822 --> 00:15:07.906
Good night!

224
00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:10.701
Scream if
you need anything.

225
00:15:10.993 --> 00:15:13.286
So we've hired
Miss Jellinsky.

226
00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:16.915
- She's a gem, don't you think?
- She's perfect.

227
00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:20.168
Oh, Fester,
I'm such a lucky man.

228
00:15:20.169 --> 00:15:24.130
I hope that someday you'll
know the indescribable joy

229
00:15:24.131 --> 00:15:25.173
of having children,

230
00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:27.008
and of paying someone else
to raise them.

231
00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:29.052
But first,
wouldn't I have to get married?

232
00:15:29.053 --> 00:15:34.515
Oh, but you're just a boy.
There's plenty of time.

233
00:15:34.516 --> 00:15:36.976
You'll meet someone,
someone very special.

234
00:15:36.977 --> 00:15:41.690
- Someone who won't press charges.
- Oh, I'd like that.

235
00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:44.443
You rascal.

236
00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:48.280
Oh!

237
00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:50.616
And what's this?

238
00:15:54.536 --> 00:15:56.288
- Mom.
- Mom.

239
00:16:02.586 --> 00:16:06.422
<i>Tonight on</i> America's Most
Disgusting Unsolved Crimes

240
00:16:06.423 --> 00:16:10.094
<i>we investigate
the case of Ursula,</i>

241
00:16:10.719 --> 00:16:12.178
<i>Carmen</i>

242
00:16:12.179 --> 00:16:13.513
<i>and Nadine.</i>

243
00:16:13.514 --> 00:16:17.684
Three very different women
with one thing in common.

244
00:16:17.685 --> 00:16:18.185
<i>Murder!</i>

245
00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:19.727
<i>And they're all
the same woman.</i>

246
00:16:19.728 --> 00:16:22.397
<i>She's known by the police
as a black widow.</i>

247
00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:24.983
<i>She mates, then she kills.</i>

248
00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:26.484
<i>She investigates wealthy men,</i>

249
00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:29.112
<i>finding the richest,
loneliest bachelors,</i>

250
00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:31.864
<i>gaining their trust
and their love</i>

251
00:16:31.865 --> 00:16:33.616
<i>and finally she marries them.</i>

252
00:16:33.617 --> 00:16:38.079
<i>Then on the wedding night,
she kills them.</i>

253
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:38.913
The deaths appear accidental.

254
00:16:38.914 --> 00:16:42.750
<i>Then after the funeral,
she disappears, cash in hand.</i>

255
00:16:42.751 --> 00:16:44.127
<i>But the money never lasts,</i>

256
00:16:44.128 --> 00:16:46.921
<i>and soon the black widow
is hungry again.</i>

257
00:16:46.922 --> 00:16:48.673
<i>Hungry for cash,
hungry for love.</i>

258
00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:53.594
<i>A mistress of disguise,
she has eluded the authorities for years.</i>

259
00:16:53.595 --> 00:16:54.095
<i>Who is she,</i>

260
00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:58.057
<i>and what seemingly innocent
pose will she next assume?</i>

261
00:16:58.058 --> 00:17:00.810
<i>All we can say is,</i>

262
00:17:00.811 --> 00:17:02.729
<i>bachelors, beware.</i>

263
00:17:35.095 --> 00:17:37.305
We'll be going out
for most of the morning.

264
00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:42.853
All the important numbers,
police, fire department, morgue.

265
00:17:45.189 --> 00:17:47.483
Fester, come along!

266
00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:50.693
Goodbye, Fester.

267
00:17:50.694 --> 00:17:53.155
Say goodbye to Debbie.

268
00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:00.536
Have fun!

269
00:18:05.209 --> 00:18:08.128
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

270
00:18:08.462 --> 00:18:12.382
Fester Addams. My, my.

271
00:18:12.466 --> 00:18:15.301
Stocks and bonds,

272
00:18:15.302 --> 00:18:16.804
deeds,

273
00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:19.013
gold bullion.

274
00:18:29.441 --> 00:18:31.067
Treasury bills,

275
00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:32.235
IRAs.

276
00:18:37.282 --> 00:18:39.952
What a strange, old house.

277
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.911
It's so drafty.

278
00:18:41.912 --> 00:18:45.124
It's really no place
for children.

279
00:18:50.045 --> 00:18:52.256
No place at all.

280
00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:57.009
Hold still, you little brat.

281
00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:58.846
He's not a brat.

282
00:19:00.222 --> 00:19:04.476
Of course not.
He's an adorable, little baby.

283
00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:05.685
Fine. Rub it in.

284
00:19:05.686 --> 00:19:10.189
We're getting him all ready
for a nice, little walk.

285
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.649
Would you like to come?

286
00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.902
Are you really a nanny?

287
00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:16.154
What a question.

288
00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:18.157
Why did you come here?

289
00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:21.910
Why, to take care of you,

290
00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:25.038
all of you.

291
00:19:25.247 --> 00:19:27.583
Especially my uncle?

292
00:19:34.923 --> 00:19:36.883
I shouldn't be
telling you this.

293
00:19:36.884 --> 00:19:40.970
They swore me to secrecy,
the little angels.

294
00:19:40.971 --> 00:19:44.974
But they want to go.
It's all they talked about all morning.

295
00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:46.934
They're just afraid
to ask you.

296
00:19:46.935 --> 00:19:51.064
They're afraid you'll think
that they don't love you.

297
00:19:51.148 --> 00:19:52.565
The poor things.

298
00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:55.651
- It is a bizarre request.
- It's horrifying.

299
00:19:55.652 --> 00:19:57.320
They have their hearts
set on it.

300
00:19:57.321 --> 00:20:01.908
I knew you'd want to know
as concerned, caring parents.

301
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:04.160
Oh, Gomez,
what shall we do?

302
00:20:04.161 --> 00:20:05.453
How can we say no?

303
00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:07.747
Don't even
mention it to them.

304
00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:08.956
Just do it.

305
00:20:08.957 --> 00:20:13.211
I'm sure they'll deny
everything, but they want to go.

306
00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:15.214
God love 'em.

307
00:20:16.757 --> 00:20:19.134
- Summer camp.
- Summer camp.

308
00:20:21.428 --> 00:20:23.095
Camp Chippewa.

309
00:20:23.096 --> 00:20:24.680
How charming.

310
00:20:24.681 --> 00:20:25.723
What's a Chippewa?

311
00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:27.850
It's an old
Indian word.

312
00:20:27.851 --> 00:20:29.686
It means orphan.

313
00:20:32.189 --> 00:20:36.108
Fresh air,
the scent of pine.

314
00:20:36.109 --> 00:20:38.694
Wednesday,
look at all of the other children,

315
00:20:38.695 --> 00:20:44.826
their freckles, their bright, little
eyes, their eager, friendly smiles.

316
00:20:45.535 --> 00:20:46.535
Help them.

317
00:20:46.536 --> 00:20:49.664
Hi. I'm Amanda Buckman.

318
00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:51.791
Why are you
dressed like that?

319
00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:52.333
Like what?

320
00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:54.252
Like you're going
to a funeral.

321
00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:57.380
Why are you dressed
like somebody died?

322
00:20:57.381 --> 00:20:58.757
Wait.

323
00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:00.549
Hi. Don Buckman.

324
00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:04.637
Isn't this place something else?
Very exclusive.

325
00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:05.429
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

326
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.765
A kid has to be extra
special to get in here.

327
00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:08.849
Gifted, exceptional.

328
00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:11.602
Our Amanda's already
skipped two grades.

329
00:21:11.603 --> 00:21:13.104
How about your boy?

330
00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:14.564
Probation.

331
00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.315
We just love Chippewa.

332
00:21:16.316 --> 00:21:20.278
Amanda couldn't wait.
It's all she talked about.

333
00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:23.156
She's got
a whole new wardrobe.

334
00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:25.074
And this little lady?

335
00:21:25.075 --> 00:21:27.535
Oh, Wednesday's
at that very special age

336
00:21:27.536 --> 00:21:30.789
when a girl has only
one thing on her mind.

337
00:21:31.164 --> 00:21:32.748
Boys?

338
00:21:32.749 --> 00:21:34.293
Homicide.

339
00:21:36.837 --> 00:21:39.297
Attention!
Hey, listen up, everybody.

340
00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:40.548
I'm Gary Granger!

341
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:44.343
And I'm
Becky Martin-Granger.

342
00:21:44.886 --> 00:21:47.305
We're the owners and
directors here at Camp Chippewa,

343
00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:51.475
America's foremost facility
for privileged young adults!

344
00:21:51.476 --> 00:21:55.771
And we're all here
to learn, to grow

345
00:21:55.772 --> 00:21:57.773
and to just
plain have fun!

346
00:21:57.774 --> 00:22:01.110
'Cause that's what being
privileged is all about.

347
00:22:04.865 --> 00:22:05.865
- Buffy!
- Debbie!

348
00:22:05.866 --> 00:22:08.659
I'm fine. How are you?

349
00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.453
How are you doing?

350
00:22:11.913 --> 00:22:14.498
Mom, I don't... I don't
think I like it here.

351
00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:15.750
Oh, will you
stop already?

352
00:22:15.751 --> 00:22:17.168
Do you know
how dirty you are?

353
00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:19.045
Selma,
please leave him alone.

354
00:22:19.046 --> 00:22:19.628
I can't breathe.

355
00:22:19.629 --> 00:22:22.131
Oh, stop it, Joel, please.
Now stand up straight.

356
00:22:22.132 --> 00:22:24.050
This is why
he's sick all the time.

357
00:22:24.051 --> 00:22:25.760
Oh, Dell, don't start
with me on that, please.

358
00:22:25.761 --> 00:22:30.181
This is it, you did this.
This has nothing to do with allergies.

359
00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:32.683
You did this.
You did this.

360
00:22:32.684 --> 00:22:34.101
Can you breathe?
Can you breathe?

361
00:22:34.102 --> 00:22:36.355
Stand up straight.
Stand up straight.

362
00:22:36.646 --> 00:22:37.605
"Everyone at the ball

363
00:22:37.606 --> 00:22:40.024
"turned and stared
at Cinderella.

364
00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:43.819
"'Who is that beautiful
woman?', everyone asked.

365
00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:47.239
"Even Prince Charming noticed
the new arrival.

366
00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.701
"'Who are you?, '
he asked Cinderella.

367
00:22:53.246 --> 00:22:57.584
"'My name is Cinderella, '
she said to the prince.

368
00:22:57.959 --> 00:22:59.418
"'Could you tell me,

369
00:22:59.419 --> 00:23:02.380
"'who is that man
over by the punch bowl?'"

370
00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:05.634
"That fascinating man,

371
00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:09.346
"that oddly sensual man.

372
00:23:09.429 --> 00:23:14.893
"That man who makes me quiver
under my bodice.

373
00:23:15.894 --> 00:23:18.187
"That bald man."

374
00:23:24.569 --> 00:23:26.654
She's driving me wild!

375
00:23:26.655 --> 00:23:28.281
- Who?
- Debbie!

376
00:23:28.448 --> 00:23:28.907
Debbie.

377
00:23:28.908 --> 00:23:32.535
Even the sound of her name.
Debbie.

378
00:23:32.536 --> 00:23:34.078
Isn't it beautiful?

379
00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:38.040
She makes me think of vinyl.
Chemicals!

380
00:23:38.041 --> 00:23:41.669
Truly, Fester, has it finally
happened at long last?

381
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:42.962
I don't know.
I think so.

382
00:23:42.963 --> 00:23:46.006
All these years
I've watched you and Morticia

383
00:23:46.007 --> 00:23:49.093
through windows,
doorways, keyholes.

384
00:23:49.094 --> 00:23:50.761
I've been so happy for you.

385
00:23:50.762 --> 00:23:53.848
But I have to confess,
I've been jealous, too.

386
00:23:53.849 --> 00:23:59.270
I've dreamed that sometime maybe
there might be someone for me.

387
00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:02.314
- There's Thing.
- Oh, I know, I know.

388
00:24:02.315 --> 00:24:04.066
But I want more!

389
00:24:04.067 --> 00:24:07.737
Legs, elbows, a head.

390
00:24:08.238 --> 00:24:09.613
Two legs?

391
00:24:09.614 --> 00:24:10.239
Dare I...

392
00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.534
Dare I ask
Debbie to dinner?

393
00:24:13.535 --> 00:24:16.370
What if she says no?
What if she says yes?

394
00:24:16.371 --> 00:24:19.206
Oh, Gomez, if I asked her,
would you come?

395
00:24:19.207 --> 00:24:23.044
- You and Morticia.
- Of course.

396
00:24:30.677 --> 00:24:31.385
Lifesaving.

397
00:24:31.386 --> 00:24:33.721
Now I know we're all
top-notch, little swimmers,

398
00:24:33.722 --> 00:24:35.389
but now we get
to show our stuff

399
00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:39.060
and earn
those certificates!

400
00:24:39.686 --> 00:24:43.772
Hey, how about our first little
pair of lifesaving buddies?

401
00:24:43.773 --> 00:24:46.109
Amanda, Wednesday.

402
00:24:46.276 --> 00:24:47.902
Is that your
bathing suit?

403
00:24:47.903 --> 00:24:49.278
Is that your overbite?

404
00:24:49.279 --> 00:24:51.363
Now one of you will be
the drowning victim,

405
00:24:51.364 --> 00:24:55.618
and the other one
gets to be our lifesaver.

406
00:24:55.619 --> 00:24:57.161
I'll be the victim.

407
00:24:57.162 --> 00:24:58.204
All your life.

408
00:24:58.205 --> 00:25:00.749
I'm going to be
an actress.

409
00:25:01.583 --> 00:25:02.000
<i>Brava!</i>

410
00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:06.087
Now, Amanda, jump in,
swim out a few yards and start drowning.

411
00:25:10.217 --> 00:25:12.218
Help me! Help me!

412
00:25:12.219 --> 00:25:15.721
I'm drowning! Help me!

413
00:25:15.722 --> 00:25:17.682
I'm dying!

414
00:25:19.267 --> 00:25:21.186
I can't swim.

415
00:25:47.128 --> 00:25:51.340
It's our favorite bistro.
We've been coming here for years.

416
00:25:51.341 --> 00:25:54.386
Of course,
it has been redone.

417
00:25:55.053 --> 00:25:57.055
Oh, it's just lovely.

418
00:25:57.347 --> 00:25:59.391
Isn't it, Fester?

419
00:26:01.643 --> 00:26:02.978
Fester.

420
00:26:08.984 --> 00:26:11.277
It's a quaint
French custom,

421
00:26:11.278 --> 00:26:13.529
sharing half-eaten bread.

422
00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.322
Fester is
truly continental.

423
00:26:15.323 --> 00:26:17.199
He spent
many years abroad.

424
00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.160
He speaks 12 languages
fluently.

425
00:26:20.161 --> 00:26:20.703
I could tell.

426
00:26:20.704 --> 00:26:24.873
You know, when I first saw him,
I thought he was from Europe.

427
00:26:25.625 --> 00:26:28.253
- You did?
- It's true.

428
00:26:28.378 --> 00:26:30.297
But I took a bath.

429
00:26:36.136 --> 00:26:40.931
Fester's really a wonderful man.
He's just terribly shy.

430
00:26:40.932 --> 00:26:44.602
Really, I just can't tell.
Does he like me at all?

431
00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:47.813
Of course, he does.
He vomited.

432
00:26:47.814 --> 00:26:48.606
That's true.

433
00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:51.984
Does he always do that
with women he likes?

434
00:26:51.985 --> 00:26:54.821
Oh, no. Just you.

435
00:26:56.489 --> 00:26:58.449
Do you think she minded?

436
00:26:58.450 --> 00:26:59.617
Of course not.

437
00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:00.492
She adores you.

438
00:27:00.493 --> 00:27:03.955
Ugh! I'm making
such a mess of things.

439
00:27:04.497 --> 00:27:07.666
Gomez, how do you do it?

440
00:27:07.667 --> 00:27:10.294
How can I be like you?

441
00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:12.755
How can I be suave?

442
00:27:12.756 --> 00:27:14.465
Woo her, admire her.

443
00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:19.678
Make her feel like she's the
most sublime creature on earth.

444
00:27:19.679 --> 00:27:21.931
Yes. That's it?

445
00:27:22.349 --> 00:27:24.016
We're back.

446
00:27:24.017 --> 00:27:26.269
Noses powdered.

447
00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:32.150
Perfection achieved.

448
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.445
We are the luckiest
brothers on earth.

449
00:27:36.446 --> 00:27:39.615
We are unworthy
of such splendor,

450
00:27:39.616 --> 00:27:43.078
undeserving
of such radiance.

451
00:27:47.666 --> 00:27:48.749
That's right.

452
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:52.629
We should have
ugly girls.

453
00:30:40.338 --> 00:30:43.131
And then the ghost said,

454
00:30:43.132 --> 00:30:46.802
"And I will haunt you
forever."

455
00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:52.851
Wednesday, you have to
continue the ghost story.

456
00:30:52.934 --> 00:30:53.809
This is dumb.

457
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:56.521
Well, if you can't do it...

458
00:31:02.235 --> 00:31:03.861
And so the next night,

459
00:31:03.862 --> 00:31:07.114
the ghost returned
to the haunted cabin,

460
00:31:07.115 --> 00:31:09.366
and he said to the campers,

461
00:31:09.367 --> 00:31:12.202
"None of you really
believe in me,

462
00:31:12.203 --> 00:31:15.206
"so I'll have to prove
my power."

463
00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:19.878
And the next morning,
when the campers woke up,

464
00:31:20.378 --> 00:31:24.339
all of their old noses
had grown back.

465
00:31:47.238 --> 00:31:50.825
Oh, Fester,
how you must hate me.

466
00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:52.744
What?

467
00:31:53.286 --> 00:31:57.998
Here you are,
a debonair man of the world.

468
00:31:57.999 --> 00:32:00.500
How I must bore you.

469
00:32:00.501 --> 00:32:02.378
Oh, never.

470
00:32:02.962 --> 00:32:07.257
Fester, before we go
any further,

471
00:32:07.258 --> 00:32:08.926
I have a confession,

472
00:32:08.927 --> 00:32:11.596
something I must tell you.

473
00:32:15.183 --> 00:32:17.267
I'm a virgin.

474
00:32:17.268 --> 00:32:19.519
- You are?
- Yes.

475
00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.397
What's that?

476
00:32:22.106 --> 00:32:27.111
It-it's someone
who's never experienced

477
00:32:27.528 --> 00:32:29.489
physical love.

478
00:32:29.656 --> 00:32:31.823
Oh...

479
00:32:31.824 --> 00:32:34.285
You mean,
with another person.

480
00:32:36.204 --> 00:32:40.959
Then, Debbie,
I have a confession to make as well.

481
00:32:41.292 --> 00:32:43.211
I'm one, too.

482
00:32:43.461 --> 00:32:45.379
You? You?

483
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.338
Yes.

484
00:32:46.339 --> 00:32:49.174
But with your looks,
your charm,

485
00:32:49.175 --> 00:32:51.635
women must follow you
everywhere.

486
00:32:51.636 --> 00:32:53.805
Store detectives.

487
00:32:54.055 --> 00:32:55.263
Oh, Fester.

488
00:32:55.264 --> 00:33:00.520
I always dreamed of meeting
someone untouched,

489
00:33:00.603 --> 00:33:02.145
someone pure,

490
00:33:02.146 --> 00:33:05.482
someone just like you.

491
00:33:05.483 --> 00:33:07.234
You'll meet him.

492
00:33:07.235 --> 00:33:11.697
And... And I dreamed
that when I met him,

493
00:33:11.698 --> 00:33:15.659
that we would wait
until our wedding night

494
00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.786
to give ourselves
to one another,

495
00:33:17.787 --> 00:33:21.708
to make
the ultimate sacrifice.

496
00:33:22.333 --> 00:33:23.835
A goat?

497
00:33:24.419 --> 00:33:27.921
Until now I thought
it was impossible.

498
00:33:27.922 --> 00:33:30.299
But, Fester Addams,

499
00:33:30.383 --> 00:33:32.343
I love you.

500
00:33:33.845 --> 00:33:34.678
You do?

501
00:33:34.679 --> 00:33:38.433
Please, be brutally honest.
I have to know how you feel about me.

502
00:33:39.434 --> 00:33:41.184
I love you.

503
00:33:41.185 --> 00:33:45.188
I worship you.
I'd do anything for you.

504
00:33:45.189 --> 00:33:46.858
I'd pay.

505
00:33:47.191 --> 00:33:48.567
Fester!

506
00:33:48.568 --> 00:33:50.028
Debbie!

507
00:34:00.496 --> 00:34:02.122
Look at him.

508
00:34:02.123 --> 00:34:03.916
So peaceful.

509
00:34:04.542 --> 00:34:08.003
This evening as I watched
Fester and Debbie,

510
00:34:08.004 --> 00:34:10.630
I kept my fingers crossed.

511
00:34:10.631 --> 00:34:12.799
- I hoped.
- I prayed.

512
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.217
Let them fall in love.

513
00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:16.261
Let them know happiness.

514
00:34:16.262 --> 00:34:17.847
Let them adopt.

515
00:34:18.056 --> 00:34:21.808
Gomez, Morticia,
great news.

516
00:34:21.809 --> 00:34:24.895
Something impossible,
a miracle.

517
00:34:24.896 --> 00:34:27.190
- The rash!
- It's gone.

518
00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.734
I'm engaged.

519
00:34:32.987 --> 00:34:35.781
- That ring.
- It was our mother's.

520
00:34:35.782 --> 00:34:37.617
She was buried with it.

521
00:34:47.335 --> 00:34:48.168
Mail call!

522
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:50.712
- Addams.
- Barkley, Castleman,

523
00:34:50.713 --> 00:34:53.965
Calloway, Dexter, Donman,

524
00:34:53.966 --> 00:34:55.884
Edwards, Evans,

525
00:34:55.885 --> 00:34:59.471
Finley, Fisher,
Framingham...

526
00:34:59.472 --> 00:35:01.389
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

527
00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:02.557
This is
unspeakable.

528
00:35:02.558 --> 00:35:04.768
Is something wrong,
Wednesday?

529
00:35:04.769 --> 00:35:05.644
Bad news?

530
00:35:05.645 --> 00:35:07.521
This is the worst thing
that has ever happened

531
00:35:07.522 --> 00:35:09.773
in the history
of human events.

532
00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:11.691
Uncle Fester
is getting married.

533
00:35:11.692 --> 00:35:15.070
A wedding?
But that's great news.

534
00:35:15.071 --> 00:35:16.071
To whom?

535
00:35:16.072 --> 00:35:17.114
The nanny.

536
00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:18.490
Get out of the cabin.

537
00:35:18.491 --> 00:35:21.868
I mean, I'll kill myself.
The help?

538
00:35:21.869 --> 00:35:25.038
I'm sure she's
a very nice lady.

539
00:35:25.039 --> 00:35:26.248
I think that's disgusting.

540
00:35:26.249 --> 00:35:30.293
I think their whole family's like
some weird medical experiment.

541
00:35:30.294 --> 00:35:33.421
I think they're like
circus people.

542
00:35:33.422 --> 00:35:36.342
- What did you say?
- Tempers!

543
00:35:36.759 --> 00:35:38.469
Group hug.

544
00:35:44.684 --> 00:35:46.352
Wednesday,

545
00:35:48.229 --> 00:35:49.814
Pugsley,

546
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.732
will a hug hurt us?

547
00:35:52.733 --> 00:35:53.817
We don't hug.

548
00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:56.403
Oh! They're
just shy.

549
00:35:56.404 --> 00:35:59.824
- We're not shy.
- We're contagious.

550
00:36:01.617 --> 00:36:05.203
I'm sensing
some friction here,

551
00:36:05.204 --> 00:36:07.539
something not
quite Chippewa.

552
00:36:08.416 --> 00:36:09.291
But, hey, no problemo.

553
00:36:09.292 --> 00:36:13.086
All they need are
good friends, good fun and

554
00:36:13.087 --> 00:36:16.090
a little time
in the harmony hut.

555
00:36:18.843 --> 00:36:22.180
How long
do we have to stay in here?

556
00:36:22.221 --> 00:36:24.223
Until we crack.

557
00:36:26.851 --> 00:36:28.477
Have fun.

558
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:30.645
What are you in for?

559
00:36:30.646 --> 00:36:33.732
I wouldn't go
horseback riding.

560
00:36:33.733 --> 00:36:35.192
That's all?

561
00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:38.612
And I wouldn't make
a bird house.

562
00:36:38.613 --> 00:36:39.738
Why not?

563
00:36:39.739 --> 00:36:41.364
I just wanted to read.

564
00:36:41.365 --> 00:36:43.825
Not on my time,
four eyes.

565
00:36:55.588 --> 00:36:56.463
Hurry up.

566
00:36:56.464 --> 00:36:58.549
I'm coming.

567
00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:00.884
- Wait.
- Who's there?

568
00:37:00.885 --> 00:37:03.762
Be careful. Tetanus.

569
00:37:04.305 --> 00:37:07.599
There they are! I saw them sneak out.

570
00:37:12.021 --> 00:37:13.855
Children,
what do you think you're doing?

571
00:37:13.856 --> 00:37:17.525
We have to see our family.
It's very important.

572
00:37:17.526 --> 00:37:20.070
More important
than a summer of fun?

573
00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:22.530
More important
than making new friends?

574
00:37:22.531 --> 00:37:24.407
More important
than sharing?

575
00:37:24.408 --> 00:37:28.704
And, Joel Glicker,
I'm surprised at you.

576
00:37:28.871 --> 00:37:31.998
I-I have to get out of here.
I have allergies.

577
00:37:31.999 --> 00:37:33.583
Oh, you're allergic?

578
00:37:33.584 --> 00:37:36.711
To sunshine
and archery and crafts?

579
00:37:36.712 --> 00:37:37.379
Yes.

580
00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.881
I think
they should be punished.

581
00:37:39.882 --> 00:37:40.382
Punished!

582
00:37:40.383 --> 00:37:42.342
Punished! Punished!

583
00:37:42.343 --> 00:37:45.220
Punished! Punished!

584
00:37:45.221 --> 00:37:48.181
No! No!
We are not here to punish.

585
00:37:48.182 --> 00:37:50.225
We are here to inspire.

586
00:37:50.226 --> 00:37:52.352
Campers,
do you know what I think

587
00:37:52.353 --> 00:37:54.062
our little ninja friends
here need?

588
00:37:54.063 --> 00:37:55.897
Do you know what just
might turn their sad

589
00:37:55.898 --> 00:37:59.277
and potentially wasted
little lives right on around?

590
00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:01.487
What?

591
00:38:02.571 --> 00:38:06.951
<i>♪ Kumbaya, my Lord</i>

592
00:38:07.034 --> 00:38:09.620
<i>♪ Kumbaya</i>

593
00:38:09.912 --> 00:38:12.956
<i>♪ Kumbaya, my Lord</i>

594
00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:15.793
<i>♪ Kumbaya</i>

595
00:38:16.127 --> 00:38:19.296
<i>♪ Kumbaya, my Lord</i>

596
00:38:19.297 --> 00:38:21.673
<i>♪ Kumbaya</i>

597
00:38:21.674 --> 00:38:25.845
<i>♪ Oh Lord, kumbaya ♪</i>

598
00:38:32.476 --> 00:38:34.936
Now, Debbie,
have you met everyone?

599
00:38:34.937 --> 00:38:38.190
- Morticia.
- Margaret.

600
00:38:39.191 --> 00:38:42.068
Margaret, this is
our bride-to-be.

601
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.986
Welcome to our family.

602
00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:47.782
I can't tell you what it's meant
to me joining the Addams clan.

603
00:38:47.783 --> 00:38:50.785
Have you met my husband,
Cousin Itt?

604
00:38:50.786 --> 00:38:52.287
Cousin Itt?

605
00:38:52.288 --> 00:38:53.496
We've been so happy.

606
00:38:53.497 --> 00:38:55.832
And just as little
Pubert arrived,

607
00:38:55.833 --> 00:39:01.422
we were blessed with our
own little bundle of joy.

608
00:39:07.553 --> 00:39:08.595
What.

609
00:39:08.596 --> 00:39:09.846
Oh, I didn't say anything.

610
00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:13.808
No, that's the baby's
nickname, What.

611
00:39:13.809 --> 00:39:15.977
From the obstetrician.

612
00:39:15.978 --> 00:39:17.937
Isn't he precious?

613
00:39:17.938 --> 00:39:19.105
We've had offers.

614
00:39:19.106 --> 00:39:23.443
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow

615
00:39:23.444 --> 00:39:27.448
<i>♪ Which nobody can deny ♪</i>

616
00:39:27.782 --> 00:39:31.159
You guys are
the best bunch of friends

617
00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.078
a fellow could hope for.

618
00:39:34.121 --> 00:39:35.497
What a party!

619
00:39:35.498 --> 00:39:40.168
And now,
for the <i>piece de resistance!</i>

620
00:39:46.133 --> 00:39:47.885
Ta-da!

621
00:39:56.018 --> 00:39:58.354
Ta-da!

622
00:40:11.575 --> 00:40:13.076
That poor girl.

623
00:40:13.077 --> 00:40:17.622
Lurch, was she in there
before you baked?

624
00:40:25.923 --> 00:40:27.591
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

625
00:40:32.638 --> 00:40:34.305
Are you
really allergic?

626
00:40:34.306 --> 00:40:37.435
Uh-huh.
To almost everything.

627
00:40:37.643 --> 00:40:40.311
- No, you're not.
- Am, too.

628
00:40:40.312 --> 00:40:43.690
I can't have dairy products,
or wear wool,

629
00:40:43.691 --> 00:40:45.692
or drink
fluoridated water.

630
00:40:45.693 --> 00:40:50.030
Do you know what happens if
my mom uses a fabric softener?

631
00:40:50.489 --> 00:40:51.865
What?

632
00:40:51.866 --> 00:40:53.409
I die.

633
00:41:04.003 --> 00:41:05.336
Where are you?

634
00:41:05.337 --> 00:41:06.671
Over here.

635
00:41:06.672 --> 00:41:07.422
Where?

636
00:41:07.423 --> 00:41:09.008
By the skeleton.

637
00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:16.222
I-I got your message
inside my cutlet.

638
00:41:16.223 --> 00:41:18.683
I need to ask you
something.

639
00:41:18.684 --> 00:41:19.184
What?

640
00:41:19.185 --> 00:41:22.605
Do you believe
in the existence of evil?

641
00:41:23.022 --> 00:41:24.689
Well, did you meet my mom?

642
00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:31.237
My uncle Fester's about to get married
to this woman in a white uniform.

643
00:41:31.238 --> 00:41:32.780
A radiologist.

644
00:41:32.781 --> 00:41:33.531
A nanny.

645
00:41:33.532 --> 00:41:35.283
But I have to go
to the wedding.

646
00:41:35.284 --> 00:41:39.288
I have a pass.
Do you want to come?

647
00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:42.874
You mean, like, on a date?

648
00:41:42.875 --> 00:41:44.126
No.

649
00:41:44.543 --> 00:41:46.003
I'd love to.

650
00:42:53.445 --> 00:42:56.656
I, Fester Addams,

651
00:42:56.657 --> 00:43:01.245
do hereby declare
my unending love.

652
00:43:03.455 --> 00:43:06.250
I will worship you forever.

653
00:43:07.668 --> 00:43:09.335
I will devote

654
00:43:09.336 --> 00:43:13.464
my every waking moment

655
00:43:13.465 --> 00:43:15.800
to your happiness alone.

656
00:43:18.887 --> 00:43:19.637
Oh!

657
00:43:19.638 --> 00:43:23.182
Henceforth,
I am your eternal

658
00:43:23.183 --> 00:43:25.436
and helpless slave.

659
00:43:28.314 --> 00:43:29.815
Nice.

660
00:43:31.775 --> 00:43:33.109
Ditto.

661
00:43:46.123 --> 00:43:49.500
You're going to have
a wonderful life together.

662
00:43:49.501 --> 00:43:50.752
Yes, I am.

663
00:43:50.753 --> 00:43:54.922
Come, darling,
let's see who's the next happy bride.

664
00:43:54.923 --> 00:43:56.049
Come on!

665
00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:57.425
Here, Debbie!

666
00:43:57.426 --> 00:43:58.635
To me!

667
00:43:58.636 --> 00:43:59.636
To me! Me!

668
00:43:59.637 --> 00:44:00.928
- I have it!
- No, I have it!

669
00:44:00.929 --> 00:44:04.808
- No! I have it!
- It's mine! I got it!

670
00:44:05.893 --> 00:44:07.935
Now you have
to get married.

671
00:44:07.936 --> 00:44:10.606
- It's not binding.
- Tramp.

672
00:44:10.856 --> 00:44:12.231
Bye!

673
00:44:12.232 --> 00:44:13.816
Congratulations!

674
00:44:13.817 --> 00:44:15.193
Congratulations!

675
00:44:15.194 --> 00:44:17.071
<i>Bon voyage!</i>

676
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:33.461
The key ingredient

677
00:44:33.462 --> 00:44:36.798
to a successful
Hawaiian honeymoon

678
00:44:36.799 --> 00:44:39.801
is romantic music.

679
00:44:42.888 --> 00:44:46.391
I ordered this cassette
from <i>Time Life.</i>

680
00:44:46.392 --> 00:44:51.312
5,000 of the world's
most romantic melodies.

681
00:44:51.313 --> 00:44:53.398
It's superb.

682
00:44:53.399 --> 00:44:55.024
What do you call this?

683
00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:57.236
Number 438.

684
00:44:57.569 --> 00:45:01.699
So, do you like
romantic living?

685
00:45:01.824 --> 00:45:04.075
I do, so far.

686
00:45:04.076 --> 00:45:05.785
I love romantic living.

687
00:45:05.786 --> 00:45:09.330
Oh, Fester,
how much do you love me?

688
00:45:09.331 --> 00:45:10.707
With all my soul.

689
00:45:10.708 --> 00:45:13.000
Would you do anything for me?

690
00:45:13.001 --> 00:45:14.001
Anything.

691
00:45:14.002 --> 00:45:16.212
Would you die for me?

692
00:45:16.213 --> 00:45:17.381
Yes.

693
00:45:18.173 --> 00:45:19.717
Promise?

694
00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:34.440
Pumpkin?

695
00:45:37.443 --> 00:45:39.611
Muffin.

696
00:45:45.492 --> 00:45:49.704
Darling,
I know you're nervous.

697
00:45:49.705 --> 00:45:51.789
So am I.

698
00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:55.209
I'm not nervous.
I'm upset.

699
00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:58.338
Because of the bathtub?

700
00:46:01.049 --> 00:46:02.925
That was an accident.

701
00:46:02.926 --> 00:46:03.968
I know.

702
00:46:03.969 --> 00:46:05.762
- I'm fine.
- I know.

703
00:46:05.763 --> 00:46:08.264
Don't give it
another thought.

704
00:46:08.265 --> 00:46:13.979
Don't be frightened.
This is as new to me as it is to you.

705
00:46:15.397 --> 00:46:18.317
Have you really
never had sex?

706
00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:19.942
Never.

707
00:46:19.943 --> 00:46:22.195
Well, then how do you know
we're not having it right now?

708
00:46:22.196 --> 00:46:26.783
Sweetheart, we'll be just
like Gomez and Morticia.

709
00:46:26.784 --> 00:46:29.327
Pretend we're at home
in my room,

710
00:46:29.328 --> 00:46:33.331
Granny down the hallway,
Lurch by the door.

711
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:35.625
Oh, my God.

712
00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:39.588
Please, what is it?
What do you need?

713
00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:47.304
Only you, my dearest.

714
00:46:50.599 --> 00:46:52.183
Really?

715
00:46:52.184 --> 00:46:54.852
Fester, I'm ready.

716
00:46:56.021 --> 00:46:57.355
Just one thing.

717
00:46:57.356 --> 00:46:59.315
Gomez told me.
No giggling.

718
00:46:59.316 --> 00:47:01.067
- And?
- No hand puppets.

719
00:47:01.068 --> 00:47:01.859
- And?
- What?

720
00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:06.615
After we've made love,
you can never see your family again.

721
00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:08.950
What?

722
00:47:08.951 --> 00:47:12.286
Otherwise,
I could never really enjoy myself.

723
00:47:12.287 --> 00:47:16.374
I could never
give myself completely.

724
00:47:16.375 --> 00:47:19.043
Unless I never see
my family again?

725
00:47:19.044 --> 00:47:22.046
Yes. If I picture them
in our lives,

726
00:47:22.047 --> 00:47:26.260
I could never achieve,
you know.

727
00:47:28.053 --> 00:47:29.262
Never?

728
00:47:29.263 --> 00:47:31.180
Don't you love me?

729
00:47:31.181 --> 00:47:32.181
Of course.

730
00:47:32.182 --> 00:47:34.016
Don't you want me?

731
00:47:34.017 --> 00:47:35.352
Yes.

732
00:47:37.896 --> 00:47:39.356
Never?

733
00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:43.151
Stud.

734
00:48:00.085 --> 00:48:03.796
It's so odd we haven't
heard from Fester and Debbie.

735
00:48:03.797 --> 00:48:05.381
It's been almost a week.

736
00:48:05.382 --> 00:48:07.091
Hasn't it, little fellow?

737
00:48:08.218 --> 00:48:09.385
Look at him.

738
00:48:09.386 --> 00:48:12.306
Too much fun
at that reception.

739
00:48:17.853 --> 00:48:19.730
Hair of the pup.

740
00:48:24.318 --> 00:48:26.444
Excellent, Amanda!

741
00:48:26.445 --> 00:48:28.447
Thank you.

742
00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:29.990
Next!

743
00:48:32.284 --> 00:48:34.076
"Dear Wednesday
and Pugsley,

744
00:48:34.077 --> 00:48:38.415
"I love you dearly but I
can never see you again."

745
00:48:39.207 --> 00:48:41.376
Glicker, go!

746
00:48:42.002 --> 00:48:43.754
Good try!

747
00:48:45.964 --> 00:48:48.257
"When you are grown up
and very lonely,

748
00:48:48.258 --> 00:48:52.804
"you will understand.
Love, Uncle Fester."

749
00:48:53.847 --> 00:48:55.933
He's a dead man.

750
00:48:56.141 --> 00:48:57.601
Go!

751
00:49:03.815 --> 00:49:07.234
It's an American
bald eagle!

752
00:49:07.235 --> 00:49:09.111
But aren't they extinct?

753
00:49:09.112 --> 00:49:10.739
They are now.

754
00:49:14.284 --> 00:49:15.993
- Mrs. Addams?
- Yes?

755
00:49:15.994 --> 00:49:17.995
Your hearse, ma'am.
Where's the body?

756
00:49:17.996 --> 00:49:20.915
- He's right there.
- But he's alive.

757
00:49:20.916 --> 00:49:22.584
Tell me about it!

758
00:49:30.801 --> 00:49:33.928
Fester, we may be together
for a while.

759
00:49:33.929 --> 00:49:36.555
All our lives,<i>cara mia.</i>

760
00:49:36.556 --> 00:49:37.848
- What?
<i>- Mon cher.</i>

761
00:49:37.849 --> 00:49:39.308
- Speak English.
- Pumpkin.

762
00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:44.064
And if I have to be seen with
you, we need to make some changes.

763
00:49:44.272 --> 00:49:45.816
Changes?

764
00:49:58.996 --> 00:50:01.789
Be careful!
It's a credenza!

765
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:05.543
These are beautiful things.
They're from catalogs.

766
00:50:06.503 --> 00:50:09.506
Fester, get over here!

767
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.927
It itches.

768
00:50:13.928 --> 00:50:15.886
Don't touch it,
not until the scab falls off.

769
00:50:15.887 --> 00:50:20.057
Pumpkin, do you think
these clothes are really me?

770
00:50:20.058 --> 00:50:21.475
Of course not.
That's the point.

771
00:50:21.476 --> 00:50:22.893
Ma'am, where do you
want this thing?

772
00:50:22.894 --> 00:50:24.937
The second floor
boudoir.

773
00:50:24.938 --> 00:50:25.855
And be careful.

774
00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:28.232
- I'm her husband.
- Fester!

775
00:50:28.233 --> 00:50:29.525
Give me a kiss.

776
00:50:29.526 --> 00:50:30.484
Give me a 20.

777
00:50:30.485 --> 00:50:31.819
Watch it!

778
00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:35.866
That's a Queen Anne
chandelier!

779
00:50:36.241 --> 00:50:37.950
<i>"Hawaii is wonderful.</i>

780
00:50:37.951 --> 00:50:43.289
"I wish you were here
and I can never see you again!

781
00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:45.916
"PS, Debbie says hi."

782
00:50:45.917 --> 00:50:47.376
I don't understand.

783
00:50:47.377 --> 00:50:50.546
For weeks not a word,
and now this.

784
00:50:50.547 --> 00:50:52.423
Darling, come to bed.

785
00:50:52.424 --> 00:50:53.382
He can't be serious.

786
00:50:53.383 --> 00:50:56.302
Have I done something,
said something?

787
00:50:56.303 --> 00:50:58.721
Why does my brother
despise me?

788
00:50:58.722 --> 00:50:59.722
He adores you.

789
00:50:59.723 --> 00:51:01.182
I'd do anything for him.

790
00:51:01.183 --> 00:51:04.852
At his request,
I would rip out my eyes.

791
00:51:04.853 --> 00:51:08.939
At his command,
I would crawl on my belly

792
00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:12.359
through hot coals
and broken glass.

793
00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:13.444
Why wait?

794
00:51:13.445 --> 00:51:14.987
Has Fester gone mad?

795
00:51:14.988 --> 00:51:17.698
This is all just
some sort of phase.

796
00:51:17.699 --> 00:51:21.787
Post-honeymoon <i>malaise.</i>
It's very common.

797
00:51:22.496 --> 00:51:25.248
Do you remember
our honeymoon?

798
00:51:25.624 --> 00:51:28.042
That glorious cruise.

799
00:51:28.043 --> 00:51:29.585
No calls.

800
00:51:29.586 --> 00:51:31.420
No cares.

801
00:51:31.421 --> 00:51:33.256
No survivors.

802
00:51:34.674 --> 00:51:36.425
<i>Cara mia.</i>

803
00:51:36.426 --> 00:51:41.597
So, you still desire me
after all these years?

804
00:51:41.598 --> 00:51:43.808
The old ball and chain?

805
00:51:43.809 --> 00:51:45.143
Forever.

806
00:51:45.852 --> 00:51:47.854
I'll get them.

807
00:51:50.023 --> 00:51:50.648
Heads up, campers!

808
00:51:50.649 --> 00:51:54.485
Jamboree's only two weeks away,
and you know what that means.

809
00:51:54.486 --> 00:51:55.903
Clean cabins.

810
00:51:55.904 --> 00:51:56.862
Creating with clay.

811
00:51:56.863 --> 00:51:59.115
And canoes,
canoes, canoes!

812
00:51:59.116 --> 00:52:02.618
So we better get cracking, huh?
'Cause it's gonna be one...

813
00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:06.080
Look at this.
I got them.

814
00:52:06.081 --> 00:52:08.666
Schizos and serial killers.

815
00:52:08.667 --> 00:52:10.042
I have almost
the whole series.

816
00:52:10.043 --> 00:52:14.296
I'm only missing Jack the
Ripper and that Zodiac guy.

817
00:52:14.297 --> 00:52:15.589
But look.

818
00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:17.174
"The Black Widow."

819
00:52:17.175 --> 00:52:19.510
It might be Debbie.

820
00:52:19.511 --> 00:52:24.640
At least three
rich husbands, all dead.

821
00:52:24.641 --> 00:52:27.477
- I'll trade you.
- For what?

822
00:52:30.063 --> 00:52:31.188
Amy Fisher.

823
00:52:31.189 --> 00:52:36.443
Each year, we conclude our summer
with a very special presentation.

824
00:52:36.444 --> 00:52:38.946
Book, music
and lyrics by...

825
00:52:38.947 --> 00:52:40.866
Gary Granger!

826
00:52:41.533 --> 00:52:46.328
And this year, the old bean has come
up with something pretty exciting.

827
00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:50.207
My own personal salute
to the first Thanksgiving.

828
00:52:50.208 --> 00:52:53.335
Now we have thought
long and hard

829
00:52:53.336 --> 00:52:56.589
about choosing
just the right little actress

830
00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:58.716
for the leading role
of Sarah Miller,

831
00:52:58.717 --> 00:53:02.304
our beautiful
and kindly pilgrim lady.

832
00:53:02.387 --> 00:53:05.515
And we have selected

833
00:53:07.559 --> 00:53:09.143
Amanda Buckman!

834
00:53:10.562 --> 00:53:14.107
And in the roles
of her pilgrim pals,

835
00:53:14.149 --> 00:53:18.778
Lily, Jennifer, Tiffany, Missy, Michelle and Melissa!

836
00:53:20.238 --> 00:53:25.242
But, of course,
not everyone can be a star.

837
00:53:25.243 --> 00:53:25.577
No.

838
00:53:25.578 --> 00:53:29.205
Let's not forget
our cheery, little Chippewas,

839
00:53:29.206 --> 00:53:32.417
Mordecai, Yang,

840
00:53:32.626 --> 00:53:34.084
Esther,

841
00:53:34.085 --> 00:53:35.879
um...

842
00:53:35.962 --> 00:53:39.674
Consuela, Irwin

843
00:53:39.758 --> 00:53:40.883
and, um...

844
00:53:40.884 --> 00:53:44.553
I'm still not sure just
how to pronounce this.

845
00:53:44.554 --> 00:53:46.889
Jamil? Jamel?

846
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:48.432
Jamal.

847
00:53:48.433 --> 00:53:49.725
Whatever.

848
00:53:49.726 --> 00:53:51.810
And as their leader
in the secondary,

849
00:53:51.811 --> 00:53:56.148
but still compellingly
written role of Pocahontas,

850
00:53:56.149 --> 00:53:57.900
guess who we have
in mind?

851
00:53:57.901 --> 00:54:02.113
Our own little
brunette outcast,

852
00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:04.908
Wednesday Addams.

853
00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:21.716
We want to see
Debbie and Fester.

854
00:54:23.343 --> 00:54:25.469
Miss Debbie!

855
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:27.097
Debra!

856
00:54:29.015 --> 00:54:31.225
Gomez, where are we?

857
00:54:31.226 --> 00:54:33.102
It looks familiar.

858
00:54:33.103 --> 00:54:36.940
Of course,
the gates of hell.

859
00:54:37.691 --> 00:54:39.608
Welcome to my home.

860
00:54:39.609 --> 00:54:40.693
Might we see
my brother?

861
00:54:40.694 --> 00:54:44.990
No. He doesn't want to see
you, any of you or that.

862
00:54:46.491 --> 00:54:47.449
Why not?

863
00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:48.325
Because he's in love.

864
00:54:48.326 --> 00:54:52.121
He's wrapped in a gossamer
blanket of ecstasy,

865
00:54:52.122 --> 00:54:53.956
and he hates your guts.

866
00:54:53.957 --> 00:54:54.374
But why?

867
00:54:54.375 --> 00:54:59.086
Because you flaunted yourselves,
your great love affair.

868
00:54:59.087 --> 00:55:03.048
You kept him a child.
I've made him a man.

869
00:55:03.049 --> 00:55:05.926
Let me hear this
from his own lips.

870
00:55:05.927 --> 00:55:08.012
His lips are busy.

871
00:55:08.013 --> 00:55:12.392
- You want to talk to these people?
- Debbie.

872
00:55:16.896 --> 00:55:17.771
Go away!

873
00:55:17.772 --> 00:55:19.690
That is not my brother!

874
00:55:19.691 --> 00:55:21.900
- Sorry.
- You have enslaved him.

875
00:55:21.901 --> 00:55:26.363
You have placed Fester under
some strange sexual spell.

876
00:55:26.364 --> 00:55:27.573
I respect that.

877
00:55:27.574 --> 00:55:29.908
But, please,
may we see him?

878
00:55:29.909 --> 00:55:31.785
Don't even think about it.

879
00:55:31.786 --> 00:55:32.703
You have gone too far.

880
00:55:32.704 --> 00:55:36.749
You have married Fester,
you have destroyed his spirit,

881
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:38.334
you have taken him from us.

882
00:55:38.335 --> 00:55:42.796
All that I could forgive,
but, Debbie...

883
00:55:42.797 --> 00:55:44.174
What?

884
00:55:44.674 --> 00:55:46.300
Pastels?

885
00:55:46.301 --> 00:55:48.302
Get out of my house!

886
00:55:48.303 --> 00:55:48.969
Hit the road!

887
00:55:48.970 --> 00:55:52.931
And if you ever show
your faces around here again,

888
00:55:52.932 --> 00:55:57.394
I'll have you locked up
for trying to visit.

889
00:55:57.395 --> 00:55:58.479
Right, Fessie?

890
00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.023
Right!

891
00:56:08.656 --> 00:56:13.827
Luxor, nexor,
burst and burn!

892
00:56:13.828 --> 00:56:14.495
What is she doing?

893
00:56:14.496 --> 00:56:18.249
Just a curse.
Have a nice day.

894
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:24.630
I demand justice!

895
00:56:24.631 --> 00:56:27.424
Someone has married
my brother.

896
00:56:27.425 --> 00:56:28.175
No.

897
00:56:28.176 --> 00:56:29.718
She took him to Hawaii.

898
00:56:29.719 --> 00:56:30.260
Get out of here.

899
00:56:30.261 --> 00:56:33.138
They have moved into a large,
expensive home

900
00:56:33.139 --> 00:56:35.849
where they make love
constantly.

901
00:56:35.850 --> 00:56:37.393
I hate when that happens.

902
00:56:37.394 --> 00:56:39.520
Arrest her at once
without delay.

903
00:56:39.521 --> 00:56:40.729
- Who?
- Debbie.

904
00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:45.192
My brother's wife,
the temptress of Waikiki.

905
00:56:45.193 --> 00:56:48.529
Who are you? What are you?
Who moved the rock?

906
00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:53.951
Officer, you must issue a subpoena.
I believe they own...

907
00:56:53.952 --> 00:56:55.619
- Gomez, no!
- ...A Buick!

908
00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:58.539
Just leave.
Leave quietly. Leave now.

909
00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:02.168
Don't make me call
Ringling Brothers.

910
00:57:02.544 --> 00:57:05.754
Has the planet
gone mad?

911
00:57:05.755 --> 00:57:08.549
My brother,
passion's hostage!

912
00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:10.593
I seek justice!

913
00:57:10.635 --> 00:57:12.095
Denied!

914
00:57:12.178 --> 00:57:15.973
I shall not submit!
I shall conquer! I shall rise!

915
00:57:15.974 --> 00:57:21.604
My name is Gomez Addams,
and I have seen evil!

916
00:57:22.021 --> 00:57:24.857
I have seen horror!

917
00:57:26.359 --> 00:57:28.861
I have seen
the unholy maggots

918
00:57:28.862 --> 00:57:32.030
which feast
in the dark recesses

919
00:57:32.031 --> 00:57:34.533
of the human soul!

920
00:57:34.534 --> 00:57:35.868
They're at camp.

921
00:57:35.869 --> 00:57:38.370
I have seen
all this, Officer.

922
00:57:38.371 --> 00:57:43.960
But until today,
I had never seen

923
00:57:45.879 --> 00:57:47.213
you!

924
00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:51.259
Hook him, book him,
cook him. Now!

925
00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:53.552
Next in line.

926
00:57:53.553 --> 00:57:56.305
Yes, I'd like to renew
my passport, please.

927
00:57:56.306 --> 00:57:58.765
I'll be leaving the country
very shortly.

928
00:57:58.766 --> 00:58:00.225
Will you be
traveling alone?

929
00:58:00.226 --> 00:58:01.936
Yes. I'll be a widow.

Here they are!

943
00:58:37.764 --> 00:58:39.890
We caught them
by the pay phone.

944
00:58:39.891 --> 00:58:40.974
We were calling the FBI.

945
00:58:40.975 --> 00:58:43.644
Their uncle is in trouble.
We were running a check.

946
00:58:43.645 --> 00:58:45.521
And you are late
for your fittings.

947
00:58:45.522 --> 00:58:47.064
I don't want to be
in the pageant.

948
00:58:47.065 --> 00:58:49.733
Don't you wanna help me
realize my vision?

949
00:58:49.734 --> 00:58:51.902
Your work is puerile
and under-dramatized.

950
00:58:51.903 --> 00:58:56.573
You lack any sense of structure,
character or the Aristotelian unities.

951
00:58:56.574 --> 00:59:01.537
Young lady, I am getting just a
tad tired of your attitude problem.

952
00:59:01.538 --> 00:59:06.250
Everyone, campers!
I have a wonderful idea.

953
00:59:06.251 --> 00:59:09.169
Wednesday and Pugsley
and young Mr. Glicker here,

954
00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:14.591
well, they have just never quite
latched on to the Chippewa spirit,

955
00:59:14.592 --> 00:59:18.096
nor have some
of their little comrades.

956
00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:20.347
Isn't that sad?

957
00:59:20.348 --> 00:59:21.056
Yes!

958
00:59:21.057 --> 00:59:23.016
Don't we just hate that?

959
00:59:23.017 --> 00:59:23.476
Yes!

960
00:59:23.477 --> 00:59:26.061
Don't we wish
they would just die?

961
00:59:26.062 --> 00:59:26.937
Yes!

962
00:59:26.938 --> 00:59:27.604
Oh, no, we don't.

963
00:59:27.605 --> 00:59:29.982
But you know
what we're gonna do with them?

964
00:59:29.983 --> 00:59:33.068
We're going to make
an example.

989

Yes.

990
01:01:05.537 --> 01:01:08.623

might that be?

991
01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:14.878

You do?

995
01:01:21.886 --> 01:01:26.515
I want to smile

997
01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:33.106
Oh, darling,
do you really mean it?

998
01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:53.250

Well, he's stubborn.

01:06:50.589 --> 01:06:54.343
But you'll be right back,
won't you?

1082
01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.387
Of course.

1083
01:07:04.478 --> 01:07:08.523
I am so glad
we invited the Chippewas

1084
01:07:08.524 --> 01:07:10.775
to join us
for this holiday meal.

1085
01:07:10.776 --> 01:07:14.821
Remember,
these savages are our guests.

1086
01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:18.867
We must not be surprised at
any of their strange customs.

1087
01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:22.787
After all,
they have not had our advantages,

1088
01:07:22.788 --> 01:07:25.373
such as fine schools,

1089
01:07:25.374 --> 01:07:29.294
libraries full of books,
shampoo.

1090
01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:32.006
How.

1091
01:07:32.007 --> 01:07:35.050
I am Pocahontas,
a Chippewa maiden.

1092
01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:36.301
An Indian.

1093
01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:37.010
Enough said.

1094
01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:41.766
And I am Running Bear,
betrothed to Pocahontas.

1095
01:07:42.141 --> 01:07:42.974
In the play.

1096
01:07:42.975 --> 01:07:46.978
20 grand for summer camp,
he's Mr. Woo Woo.

1097
01:07:46.979 --> 01:07:51.358
We have brought a special gift
for this holiday feast.

1098
01:07:57.323 --> 01:07:59.741
I am a turkey. Kill me.

1099
01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:03.537
What a thoughtful gift!

1100
01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:09.000
Why, you are
as civilized as we,

1101
01:08:09.001 --> 01:08:11.753
except we wear shoes
and have last names.

1102
01:08:12.255 --> 01:08:16.382
Welcome to our table,
our new primitive friends.

1103
01:08:16.383 --> 01:08:17.383
Thank you, Sarah Miller.

1104
01:08:17.384 --> 01:08:20.428
You're the most beautiful
person I've ever seen.

1105
01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:22.055
Your hair is
the color of the sun.

1106
01:08:22.056 --> 01:08:27.393
Your skin is like fresh
milk, and everyone loves you.

1107
01:08:27.394 --> 01:08:30.106
Stop! Sit.

1108
01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:32.148
- Wait.
- What?

1109
01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:34.485
We cannot break bread
with you.

1110
01:08:35.194 --> 01:08:36.027
Huh?

1111
01:08:36.028 --> 01:08:37.529
Becky, what's going on?

1112
01:08:37.530 --> 01:08:38.655
Wednesday.

1113
01:08:38.656 --> 01:08:43.119
You have taken the land
which is rightfully ours.

1114
01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:45.328
Years from now,

1115
01:08:45.329 --> 01:08:49.207
my people will be forced to live
in mobile homes on reservations.

1116
01:08:49.208 --> 01:08:52.836
Your people will wear
cardigans and drink highballs.

1117
01:08:52.837 --> 01:08:55.755
We will sell our bracelets
by the roadsides.

1118
01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:59.384
You will play golf
and enjoy hot hors d'oeuvres.

1119
01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:02.637
My people will have pain
and degradation.

1120
01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:05.140
Your people will have
stick shifts.

1121
01:09:05.141 --> 01:09:06.933
The gods of my tribe
have spoken.

1122
01:09:06.934 --> 01:09:10.436
They have said,
"Do not trust the pilgrims,

1123
01:09:10.437 --> 01:09:13.148
"especially Sarah Miller."

1124
01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:15.275
Gary, she's changing
the words.

1125
01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:20.364
And for all these reasons,
I have decided to scalp you

1126
01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:23.826
and burn your village
to the ground.

1127
01:09:34.044 --> 01:09:35.003
Children!
Campers!

1128
01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:37.548
Stop it!
You're destroying my text!

1129
01:09:45.472 --> 01:09:46.222
He's not a team player.

1130
01:09:46.223 --> 01:09:49.058
Well, he's a special child,
but he needs friends.

1131
01:09:49.059 --> 01:09:51.729
He needs
friends like this?

1132
01:10:17.713 --> 01:10:19.548
Uh, I beg your pardon.

1133
01:10:24.136 --> 01:10:26.429
Do something!

1134
01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:17.272
<i>♪ Macho, macho man</i>

1135
01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:21.067

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:33.454
6:25.

1141
01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:35.790
Oops! Got to go.

1142
01:11:35.791 --> 01:11:37.083
- No! No!
- Wait!

1143
01:11:37.084 --> 01:11:41.337
Wait here. It's my anniversary.
I'll be right back.

1144
01:11:41.338 --> 01:11:44.590
Oh, your husband
is a very lucky man.

1145
01:11:44.591 --> 01:11:46.802
Don't say that!

1146
01:11:48.178 --> 01:11:51.347

01:11:59.565 --> 01:12:01.108
Cheers.

1149
01:12:01.608 --> 01:12:03.152
No, no.

1150
01:12:16.915 --> 01:12:18.917
And, Officer,

1151
01:12:19.918 --> 01:12:23.296
my husband was in that house.

1152
01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:45.527
Happy anniversary, Debbie.

1153
01:13:24.316 --> 01:13:27.569
Help. Help.

1154
01:13:38.163 --> 01:13:42.542
Sweetheart!
Did you get the champagne?

1155
01:13:42.543 --> 01:13:43.919
Freeze!

1156
01:13:45.796 --> 01:13:47.089
Pookie?

1157
01:13:47.172 --> 01:13:48.673
I tried to make it look
like an accident.

1158
01:13:48.674 --> 01:13:53.344
I tried to give you some dignity.
But, oh, no. Not you.

1159
01:13:53.345 --> 01:13:54.178
What are you saying?

1160
01:13:54.179 --> 01:13:58.099
I'm saying, I want you dead,
and I want your money.

1161
01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:01.395
But... But...
Don't you love me?

1162
01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:07.024
Is that a no?

1163
01:14:07.025 --> 01:14:09.569
Do I love you?
Look at yourself!

1164
01:14:09.570 --> 01:14:12.071
You're a nightmare!
You're the missing link!

1165
01:14:12.072 --> 01:14:14.907
You shouldn't be married!
You should be studied!

1166
01:14:14.908 --> 01:14:17.577
You're a big, dumb,
weird thing!

1167
01:14:17.578 --> 01:14:20.621
No woman in her right mind
could love you!

1168
01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:24.668
Thing!

1169
01:14:34.219 --> 01:14:38.556
I'll get you!
And your little hand, too!

1170
01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:13.633
Come on.

1171
01:15:13.634 --> 01:15:16.886
No. I have to go back.
For the others.

1172
01:15:16.887 --> 01:15:18.012
You're very brave.

1173
01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:21.599
And to watch the place burn.
You go.

1174
01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:22.600
Save your uncle.

1175
01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:25.520
Joel, I may never
see you again.

1176
01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:26.145
I know.

1177
01:15:26.146 --> 01:15:28.523
There are forces
tearing us apart,

1178
01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:32.569
Gary, Debbie,
seventh grade.

1179
01:15:34.613 --> 01:15:36.822
I'll never forget you.

1180
01:15:36.823 --> 01:15:38.115
You won't?

1181
01:15:38.116 --> 01:15:39.325
You're too weird.

1182
01:15:39.326 --> 01:15:43.037
We'll always have today
and Chippewa.

1183
01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:44.706
And this.

1184
01:15:46.625 --> 01:15:47.792
What is it?

1185
01:15:47.793 --> 01:15:50.045
Amanda's retainer.

1186
01:15:51.129 --> 01:15:52.922
<i>Cara mia.</i>

1187
01:15:52.923 --> 01:15:54.550
<i>Mon cher.</i>

1188
01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:05.060
Come on!

1189
01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:22.869
Move it!

1190
01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:26.956
Move out of the way!

1191
01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:38.594
"We looked!
Then we saw him step in on the mat!

1192
01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:42.431
"We looked! And we saw him!

1193
01:16:42.848 --> 01:16:45.183
"The Cat in the Hat!"

1194
01:16:45.976 --> 01:16:48.186
Are you enjoying this?

1195
01:16:49.938 --> 01:16:54.359
To think, a child of mine.

1196
01:16:55.569 --> 01:17:00.239
"I know it is wet,
and the sun is not sunny,

1197
01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:06.288
"but we can have lots
of good fun that is funny."

1198
01:17:13.337 --> 01:17:14.630
Oh, no.

1199
01:17:15.505 --> 01:17:17.132
He lives.

1200
01:17:17.299 --> 01:17:20.469
Come on! It's Gomez!

<i>♪ Swing low ♪</i>

1205
01:17:35.525 --> 01:17:40.905
My baby is ill,
and my husband is dying.

1206
01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:45.743
Oh, Mama, what shall I do?

1207
01:17:45.744 --> 01:17:48.579
Well, you have a black dress.

1208
01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:00.925
Gomez!

1209
01:18:00.926 --> 01:18:02.093
- Fester!
- Fester!

1210
01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:04.011
Fester? Where is Fester?

1211
01:18:04.012 --> 01:18:06.806
He's right here,<i>mon cher.</i>

1212
01:18:06.807 --> 01:18:08.391
It's me, Gomez.

1213
01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:11.602
I've tried to be
someone I'm not.

1214
01:18:11.603 --> 01:18:13.897
I live in shame

1215
01:18:14.106 --> 01:18:15.106
and the suburbs!

1216
01:18:15.107 --> 01:18:20.903
But you belong to Debbie.
You're Debbie's love toy.

1217
01:18:20.904 --> 01:18:25.659
You are Mr. Debbie!

1218
01:18:25.742 --> 01:18:28.077
I am an Addams!

1219
01:18:28.078 --> 01:18:29.663
Fester!

1220
01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:35.210
Uncle Fester!

1221
01:18:35.293 --> 01:18:36.795
Children!

1222
01:18:39.673 --> 01:18:42.008
You sent us to camp.

1223
01:18:42.759 --> 01:18:44.970
They made us sing.

1224
01:18:51.601 --> 01:18:54.062
My own dear family.

1225
01:18:57.232 --> 01:19:00.068
How I've missed you all.

1226
01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:04.363
Our whole family,
together at last.

1227
01:19:04.364 --> 01:19:08.326
Three generations
above ground.

1228
01:19:08.702 --> 01:19:10.579
In-laws!

1229
01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:19.628
I don't want
to hurt anybody.

1230
01:19:19.629 --> 01:19:21.922
I don't enjoy hurting anybody.

1231
01:19:21.923 --> 01:19:25.217
I don't like guns, or bombs,
or electric chairs.

1232
01:19:25.218 --> 01:19:31.475
But sometimes people just won't
listen, and so I have to use persuasion

1233
01:19:31.892 --> 01:19:33.267
and slides.

1234
01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:35.895
My parents, Sharon and Dave.

1235
01:19:35.896 --> 01:19:39.690
Generous, doting,
or were they?

1236
01:19:39.691 --> 01:19:44.445
All I ever wanted
was a Ballerina Barbie

1237
01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:46.530
in her pretty pink tutu.

1238
01:19:46.531 --> 01:19:47.865
My birthday.

1239
01:19:47.866 --> 01:19:52.037
I was 10,
and do you know what they got me?

1240
01:19:52.496 --> 01:19:57.875
Malibu Barbie.

1241
01:19:57.876 --> 01:19:59.084
The nightmare.

1242
01:19:59.085 --> 01:20:00.211
The nerve.

1243
01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:04.423
That's not what I wanted.
That's not who I was.

1244
01:20:04.424 --> 01:20:10.388
I was a ballerina.
Graceful, delicate.

1245
01:20:10.555 --> 01:20:12.599
They had to go.

1246
01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:30.991
My first husband,
the heart surgeon.

1247
01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:34.787
All day long,
coronaries, transplants.

1248
01:20:34.788 --> 01:20:36.247
What about your needs?

1249
01:20:36.248 --> 01:20:41.336
"Sorry about dinner, Deb.
The Pope has a cold."

1250
01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:46.925
An axe.
That takes me back.

1251
01:21:03.775 --> 01:21:06.235
Husband number two,
the senator.

1252
01:21:06.236 --> 01:21:09.738
He loved his state.
He loved his country.

1253
01:21:09.739 --> 01:21:11.282
What about Debbie?

1254
01:21:11.283 --> 01:21:15.035
"Sorry, Debbie.
No Mercedes this year.

1255
01:21:15.036 --> 01:21:17.706
"We have to set an example."

1256
01:21:17.998 --> 01:21:20.709
Oh, yeah? Set this!

1257
01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:39.310
My latest husband.

1258
01:21:39.311 --> 01:21:43.064
My late husband, Fester.

1259
01:21:43.356 --> 01:21:44.690
The fool.

1260
01:21:44.691 --> 01:21:46.568
The corpse.

1261
01:21:46.651 --> 01:21:49.403
And his adorable family.

1262
01:21:49.404 --> 01:21:53.283
You took me in.
You accepted me.

1263
01:21:53.408 --> 01:21:56.201
But did any of you
love me?

1264
01:21:56.202 --> 01:21:58.121
Really love me?

1265
01:21:58.455 --> 01:21:59.915
Hands.

1266
01:22:14.346 --> 01:22:16.347
So I... I killed.

1267
01:22:16.348 --> 01:22:17.222
So I maimed.

1268
01:22:17.223 --> 01:22:22.979
So I destroyed one innocent
life after another.

1269
01:22:23.063 --> 01:22:27.149
Aren't I a human being?

1270
01:22:27.150 --> 01:22:28.984
Don't I yearn

1271
01:22:28.985 --> 01:22:32.948
and ache and shop?

1272
01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:38.954
Don't I deserve love

1273
01:22:40.705 --> 01:22:42.540
and jewelry?

1274
01:23:06.314 --> 01:23:08.023
Adieu, mon cher.

1275
01:23:08.024 --> 01:23:08.941
<i>Adios, cara mia.</i>

1276
01:23:08.942 --> 01:23:13.404
Debbie, let them go.
Take me and my money.

1277
01:23:13.405 --> 01:23:16.491
For what I've done,
I deserve to die.

1278
01:23:16.866 --> 01:23:18.159
Sorry.

1279
01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:42.851
Goodbye, everybody.

1280
01:23:43.184 --> 01:23:44.685
Wish me luck.

1281
01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:46.730
Good luck.

1282
01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:45.120
A birthday party!
What a treat!

1283
01:24:45.121 --> 01:24:48.415
And to think
I might have missed all this.

1284
01:24:48.416 --> 01:24:50.960
What was I thinking of?

1285
01:24:51.294 --> 01:24:53.170
Physical pleasure.

1286
01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:56.965
Uncle Fester,
do you miss Debbie?

1287
01:24:56.966 --> 01:25:00.594
Well, sometimes,
late at night.

1288
01:25:00.595 --> 01:25:03.722
I remember how she used
to turn to me and say,

1289
01:25:03.723 --> 01:25:07.434
"Jesus, Fester,
go back to your room."

1290
01:25:10.522 --> 01:25:12.898
Yoo-hoo.

1291
01:25:15.652 --> 01:25:16.819
Are we late?

1292
01:25:18.071 --> 01:25:20.614
Not at all.
We're just getting started.

1293
01:25:20.615 --> 01:25:24.159
I hope no one minds.
We brought along a guest.

1294
01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:28.706
This is our new nanny,
Dementia.

1295
01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:34.294
Dementia.

1296
01:25:34.295 --> 01:25:37.005
What a beautiful name.

1297
01:25:37.006 --> 01:25:39.175
It means insanity.

1298
01:25:39.509 --> 01:25:44.472
My name's Fester.
It means to rot.

1299
01:25:45.265 --> 01:25:46.808
A toast.

1300
01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:49.852
To the glorious mysteries
of life.

1301
01:25:49.853 --> 01:25:53.272
To all that binds
a family as one.

1302
01:25:53.273 --> 01:25:57.776
To mirth, to merriment,
to manslaughter.

1303
01:25:57.777 --> 01:25:59.987
Hear, hear.

1304
01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:01.572
To dear friends.

1305
01:26:05.785 --> 01:26:07.829
To new friends.

1306
01:26:10.081 --> 01:26:11.540
To youth.

1307
01:26:11.541 --> 01:26:14.711
- How do I look?
- Disturbing.

1308
01:26:15.795 --> 01:26:17.588
To passion.

1309
01:26:17.589 --> 01:26:18.964
To paradise.

1310
01:26:18.965 --> 01:26:20.675
To pain.

1311
01:26:20.925 --> 01:26:22.510
Tonight.

1312
01:26:25.388 --> 01:26:29.142
Make way for
the birthday boy!

1313
01:26:31.686 --> 01:26:34.564
Thing, will you do
the honors?

1314
01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:48.785
Your family
is really interesting.

1315
01:26:48.786 --> 01:26:53.041
Your parents are so
involved with each other.

1316
01:26:55.126 --> 01:26:58.712
Wednesday, do you think,
like, maybe someday

1317
01:26:58.713 --> 01:27:02.550
you might want to get
married and have kids?

1318
01:27:03.009 --> 01:27:04.302
No.

1319
01:27:04.636 --> 01:27:07.179
But what if you met
just the right man

1320
01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:11.934
who worshiped and adored you,
who'd do anything for you,

1321
01:27:11.935 --> 01:27:14.478
who'd be your
devoted slave?

1322
01:27:14.479 --> 01:27:16.898
Then what
would you do?

1323
01:27:17.106 --> 01:27:19.025
I'd pity him.

1324
01:27:27.533 --> 01:27:29.910
Poor Debbie.
She was sick.

1325
01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:32.080
She wasn't sick.

1326
01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:34.456
She was sloppy.

1327
01:27:34.457 --> 01:27:35.916
What do you mean?

1328
01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:37.918
If I wanted
to kill my husband,

1329
01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:42.131
I'd do it,
and I wouldn't get caught.

1330
01:27:42.173 --> 01:27:43.340
How?

1331
01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:45.927
I'd scare him to death.

1332
01:27:46.886 --> 01:27:48.930
No, you wouldn't.

1333
01:27:49.264 --> 01:27:52.474
We're all
very sorry, Debbie.

1334
01:27:52.475 --> 01:27:55.853
We wish you
only the best.
