1
00:00:49.555 --> 00:00:52.890
Come, sorrow.
We welcome thee.

2
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.987
Let us join in grief,

3
00:00:55.064 --> 00:00:57.260
rejoice in despair,

4
00:00:57.334 --> 00:00:59.997
and honor
the fortunate dead.

5
00:01:00.071 --> 00:01:03.042
Dearly beloved...

6
00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:07.879
Shh!

7
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:10.113
Tsk tsk tsk.

8
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.379
Good show, old man.

9
00:01:50.452 --> 00:01:51.452
Gomez.

10
00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:53.079
Cara mia?

11
00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:54.350
Marvelous news.

12
00:01:54.424 --> 00:01:56.916
I'm going to have a baby...

13
00:01:56.996 --> 00:01:58.258
right now.

14
00:02:04.407 --> 00:02:06.842
Nurse, how close
are the contractions?

15
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.572
Every 15 seconds,
Doctor.

16
00:02:08.646 --> 00:02:10.478
Are you in
unbearable pain?

17
00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.543
Is it inhuman?
My darling, is it torture?

18
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:15.055
Oui.

19
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.660
And then mommy
kissed daddy,

20
00:02:19.731 --> 00:02:21.757
and the angel
told the stork.

21
00:02:21.834 --> 00:02:23.860
The stork
flew down from heaven

22
00:02:23.937 --> 00:02:28.377
and left a diamond under a leaf
in the cabbage patch,

23
00:02:28.445 --> 00:02:32.178
and the diamond
turned into a baby.

24
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:35.188
Our parents
are having a baby, too.

25
00:02:35.256 --> 00:02:37.782
They had sex.

26
00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.350
Push, Mrs. Addams.

27
00:02:41.498 --> 00:02:42.966
Forceps!

28
00:02:43.034 --> 00:02:44.059
Forceps.

29
00:02:44.136 --> 00:02:46.105
Forceps!

30
00:02:46.173 --> 00:02:47.173
Aah!

31
00:02:51.314 --> 00:02:53.579
Would you like
anesthesia?

32
00:02:53.651 --> 00:02:56.315
No, thank you.
But ask the children.

33
00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:57.823
Cara mia.

34
00:02:57.891 --> 00:03:00.258
Mon cher.

35
00:03:00.328 --> 00:03:01.762
Mrs. Addams, the baby?

36
00:03:01.831 --> 00:03:03.891
Pardon.

37
00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:06.130
- It's a boy.
- It's a girl.

38
00:03:07.206 --> 00:03:09.141
- Gomez!
- What news?

39
00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.336
Father,
what is it?

40
00:03:10.411 --> 00:03:13.007
It's an Addams!

41
00:03:57.151 --> 00:03:59.849
I've arranged a little surprise,
my dearest.

42
00:03:59.923 --> 00:04:02.484
I hope you like it.

43
00:04:21.757 --> 00:04:26.458
Oh, Gomez, it's dark,
it's depressing, it's desolate.

44
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:28.261
It says, "toddler."

45
00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:29.666
It's a dream.

46
00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:31.204
Come, cara mia.

47
00:04:33.141 --> 00:04:36.306
The Addams cradle.

48
00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.969
Welcome home, my son.

49
00:04:54.643 --> 00:04:56.407
That's not true.

50
00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.345
Everyone knows it is.

51
00:04:58.415 --> 00:05:01.875
When you have a new baby,
one of the other children has to die.

52
00:05:01.954 --> 00:05:05.392
- Really?
- It's a tradition. One of us has to go.

53
00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:08.487
Which one?

54
00:05:08.564 --> 00:05:10.590
Well, they only need
one boy.

55
00:05:14.573 --> 00:05:16.474
He has
my father's eyes.

56
00:05:16.543 --> 00:05:19.378
Gomez, take those
out of his mouth.

57
00:05:19.448 --> 00:05:21.246
Coochie coochie coo.

58
00:05:21.318 --> 00:05:23.754
A baby in the house.

59
00:05:23.822 --> 00:05:27.453
It's about time.
Hey, kiddo.

60
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.156
Did you see that?

61
00:05:34.739 --> 00:05:38.199
He's a real devil.

62
00:05:44.755 --> 00:05:47.224
Pugsley, the baby
weighs 10 pounds.

63
00:05:47.292 --> 00:05:49.352
The cannonball
weighs 20 pounds.

64
00:05:49.428 --> 00:05:51.921
Which will hit
the stone walkway first?

65
00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:53.729
I'm still on fractions.

66
00:05:53.802 --> 00:05:55.634
Which do you think?

67
00:05:55.705 --> 00:05:57.071
The cannonball?

68
00:05:57.141 --> 00:06:00.806
Very good.
But which one will bounce?

69
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.815
The baby?

70
00:06:02.883 --> 00:06:05.410
There's only one way
to find out.

71
00:06:05.488 --> 00:06:07.116
Ready?

72
00:06:08.693 --> 00:06:09.819
1...

73
00:06:09.894 --> 00:06:11.055
2...

74
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.224
3.

75
00:06:13.299 --> 00:06:15.131
What a glorious evening.

76
00:06:15.202 --> 00:06:17.229
Rain.

77
00:06:24.184 --> 00:06:25.412
Cara mia.

78
00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:26.485
Oh, dear.

79
00:06:32.496 --> 00:06:35.558
Children,
why do you hate the baby?

80
00:06:35.635 --> 00:06:38.629
We just want
to play with him.

81
00:06:38.706 --> 00:06:40.675
Especially his head.

82
00:06:40.743 --> 00:06:43.543
Do you think we love the baby
more than you?

83
00:06:43.614 --> 00:06:44.707
- Yes.
- Yes.

84
00:06:44.783 --> 00:06:47.275
Do you think when
a new baby arrives,

85
00:06:47.353 --> 00:06:48.946
another child
has to die?

86
00:06:49.023 --> 00:06:50.321
- Yes.
- Yes.

87
00:06:50.392 --> 00:06:52.554
Well,
that's just not true.

88
00:06:54.198 --> 00:06:55.496
Not anymore.

89
00:06:55.567 --> 00:06:58.402
It's just
sibling rivalry.

90
00:06:58.472 --> 00:07:02.934
Gomez, do you remember
what we were like?

91
00:07:03.011 --> 00:07:05.709
- I hated you!
- I despised you.

92
00:07:05.783 --> 00:07:09.186
I choked him
till he lost consciousness

93
00:07:09.255 --> 00:07:11.554
and had to be put
on a respirator.

94
00:07:11.625 --> 00:07:13.457
I tied him to a tree

95
00:07:13.528 --> 00:07:16.055
and pulled out four
of his permanent teeth.

96
00:07:16.132 --> 00:07:17.998
When he was asleep,

97
00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:21.802
I opened his skull
and removed his brains.

98
00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:23.173
You did?

99
00:07:26.382 --> 00:07:29.876
A brother!

100
00:07:29.954 --> 00:07:31.183
Brother!

101
00:07:41.606 --> 00:07:44.371
Children, you see?

102
00:08:09.016 --> 00:08:11.281
"Death! Death
to the enemies

103
00:08:11.353 --> 00:08:13.413
of the people
of the republic."

104
00:08:13.489 --> 00:08:15.082
Hoorah!

105
00:08:15.159 --> 00:08:17.094
Justice is served.

106
00:08:17.162 --> 00:08:19.530
Bring forward
the evil one.

107
00:08:41.066 --> 00:08:43.798
You have betrayed
the people of France.

108
00:08:43.871 --> 00:08:45.635
You are evil incarnate.

109
00:08:45.707 --> 00:08:47.699
How do you plead?

110
00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:49.678
Guilty.

111
00:08:49.747 --> 00:08:52.115
Guilty
by her own admission.

112
00:08:52.184 --> 00:08:53.742
The sentence is death.

113
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.314
Executioner,
place her on the block.

114
00:09:09.177 --> 00:09:10.975
1...

115
00:09:11.048 --> 00:09:12.846
2...

116
00:09:12.917 --> 00:09:15.443
Children,
what are you doing?

117
00:09:15.521 --> 00:09:16.682
- Playing!
- Playing!

118
00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:17.756
3!

119
00:09:21.464 --> 00:09:24.229
Woe to the republic.

120
00:09:25.437 --> 00:09:27.463
Look at you.

121
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.705
Midnight, moonlight,

122
00:09:30.778 --> 00:09:33.613
surrounded by death.

123
00:09:33.683 --> 00:09:35.515
It's been too long.

124
00:09:35.586 --> 00:09:38.215
Do it!
Hold him still!

125
00:09:39.592 --> 00:09:40.617
You missed.

126
00:09:45.602 --> 00:09:46.573
Here, catch!

127
00:09:46.603 --> 00:09:48.799
I don't want him!

128
00:09:50.075 --> 00:09:51.941
One house,
three children.

129
00:09:52.011 --> 00:09:53.570
So many windows.

130
00:09:53.647 --> 00:09:56.243
My darling, it's you
I'm worried about,

131
00:09:56.319 --> 00:09:57.947
the stress,
all this squabbling.

132
00:09:58.021 --> 00:09:59.887
Oh, I'll be fine.

133
00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:03.521
I'm just like any modern woman,
trying to have it all...

134
00:10:03.597 --> 00:10:05.259
loving husband, a family.

135
00:10:05.333 --> 00:10:07.929
It's just
I wish I had more time

136
00:10:08.004 --> 00:10:10.030
to seek out
the dark forces

137
00:10:10.107 --> 00:10:14.045
and join their hellish crusade,
that's all.

138
00:10:14.113 --> 00:10:17.573
You can! You shall!
So it must be!

139
00:10:18.854 --> 00:10:20.891
But how?

140
00:10:21.024 --> 00:10:23.289
Children,
as your new nanny,

141
00:10:23.361 --> 00:10:26.059
I know that we're
all concerned

142
00:10:26.133 --> 00:10:27.624
about the environment,

143
00:10:27.702 --> 00:10:31.663
so this morning,
let's discuss

144
00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:33.836
how to prevent
forest fires.

145
00:10:33.912 --> 00:10:35.642
Prevent them?

146
00:10:36.749 --> 00:10:38.149
All right, children,

147
00:10:38.218 --> 00:10:40.278
I've had it
up to here.

148
00:10:40.355 --> 00:10:44.089
Now you just answer
one simple question.

149
00:10:44.162 --> 00:10:46.631
Where is that baby?

150
00:10:46.698 --> 00:10:47.996
Which part?

151
00:10:48.067 --> 00:10:49.865
Hello, kiddies.

152
00:10:49.937 --> 00:10:51.735
I'm Polly the puppet.

153
00:10:51.806 --> 00:10:54.332
What shall we do today?

154
00:10:54.411 --> 00:10:58.440
I know.
Let's all clean our rooms.

155
00:10:58.517 --> 00:11:00.509
Hello, Polly.

156
00:11:00.587 --> 00:11:02.613
I'll clean my room

157
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:05.684
in exchange
for your immortal soul.

158
00:11:14.108 --> 00:11:15.770
Hi. Addams residence?

159
00:11:15.844 --> 00:11:18.370
Ooh, it's old.

160
00:11:20.752 --> 00:11:22.983
And big.

161
00:11:23.056 --> 00:11:24.957
Lurch.

162
00:11:26.361 --> 00:11:30.129
Hi! Hi. I'm Debbie Jellinsky
from the agency.

163
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.395
The agency?

164
00:11:31.469 --> 00:11:34.031
But they claimed
no one else was available.

165
00:11:34.107 --> 00:11:36.042
They suggested
a Doberman.

166
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.511
Surprise!
I've been out of town.

167
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:39.946
Are you the mom?

168
00:11:40.016 --> 00:11:41.541
I am Mrs. Addams.

169
00:11:41.619 --> 00:11:45.421
I love your dress.
It's so tight.

170
00:11:45.491 --> 00:11:46.652
Thank you.

171
00:11:46.727 --> 00:11:49.288
Gomez.

172
00:11:49.364 --> 00:11:51.857
I believe we may have
a new nanny...

173
00:11:51.935 --> 00:11:53.403
Miss Jellinsky.

174
00:11:53.471 --> 00:11:55.804
Deb.

175
00:11:55.874 --> 00:11:57.809
Isn't he a lady-killer?

176
00:11:57.877 --> 00:12:00.211
Acquitted.

177
00:12:00.282 --> 00:12:02.308
I'll show you
all my references

178
00:12:02.385 --> 00:12:04.183
so you'll know
I'm not a homicidal maniac.

179
00:12:04.254 --> 00:12:06.553
- Of course you're not.
- You're too young.

180
00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:10.056
Welcome to our home.

181
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:13.192
There's a belfry,
a swamp,

182
00:12:13.268 --> 00:12:15.260
and a dungeon down below.

183
00:12:15.339 --> 00:12:18.241
- Cable?
- Of course.

184
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:19.642
Debbie.

185
00:12:24.153 --> 00:12:26.782
Oh, is that
the little critter?

186
00:12:26.856 --> 00:12:29.918
Oh, no.
This is our baby.

187
00:12:29.995 --> 00:12:32.521
He's adorable. He's perfect.
What's his name?

188
00:12:32.599 --> 00:12:34.089
It was agony.

189
00:12:34.168 --> 00:12:36.604
We went through
all the usual baby names...

190
00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:37.672
Lucifer...

191
00:12:37.707 --> 00:12:38.707
Benito...

192
00:12:38.742 --> 00:12:39.903
Mao.

193
00:12:39.977 --> 00:12:41.707
Then we came
to our senses,

194
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.544
something a child
could live with...

195
00:12:43.616 --> 00:12:44.709
Pubert.

196
00:12:44.785 --> 00:12:46.913
Pubert...

197
00:12:46.988 --> 00:12:48.422
I like it.

198
00:12:48.491 --> 00:12:50.323
It's filthy.

199
00:12:50.394 --> 00:12:51.521
May I?

200
00:12:51.596 --> 00:12:53.622
Your dress,
is it flammable?

201
00:12:53.699 --> 00:12:54.997
You've had your shots...

202
00:12:55.068 --> 00:12:57.663
measles, mumps, rabies?

203
00:13:04.082 --> 00:13:08.680
Oh, I just adore
little babies.

204
00:13:08.757 --> 00:13:12.593
I just want to squeeze them
till there's not a breath left

205
00:13:12.662 --> 00:13:14.528
in their tiny little bodies.

206
00:13:14.599 --> 00:13:16.966
Hello, Pubert.

207
00:13:17.035 --> 00:13:19.004
I love you.

208
00:13:24.213 --> 00:13:27.446
Children, this is Miss Jellinsky,
our new nanny.

209
00:13:27.519 --> 00:13:29.215
What do we say?

210
00:13:29.288 --> 00:13:31.622
Be afraid.
Be very afraid.

211
00:13:33.028 --> 00:13:35.293
Look at you...

212
00:13:35.365 --> 00:13:38.859
all cooped up in this house
with a new baby.

213
00:13:38.937 --> 00:13:41.601
That's not easy,
is it?

214
00:13:41.675 --> 00:13:43.667
No.

215
00:13:43.745 --> 00:13:45.338
Why, I bet sometimes

216
00:13:45.414 --> 00:13:48.043
you wish it was
still just the two of you.

217
00:13:48.118 --> 00:13:49.518
Or less.

218
00:13:49.587 --> 00:13:52.956
Well, don't you worry.

219
00:13:53.026 --> 00:13:56.088
Everything's
going to be just fine.

220
00:13:58.201 --> 00:14:01.001
I love them.

221
00:14:01.072 --> 00:14:02.370
Thing...

222
00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:03.412
stop that.

223
00:14:03.442 --> 00:14:05.070
He likes you.

224
00:14:05.145 --> 00:14:06.977
Heh heh heh heh.

225
00:14:13.992 --> 00:14:16.827
I'm good with my hands.

226
00:14:16.897 --> 00:14:20.232
What a wonderful family,

227
00:14:20.302 --> 00:14:25.140
although there's one fella
I haven't met yet.

228
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.679
Hi there, mister.

229
00:14:27.747 --> 00:14:28.719
Your nephew?

230
00:14:28.749 --> 00:14:29.749
My brother.

231
00:14:29.784 --> 00:14:30.784
No!

232
00:14:30.819 --> 00:14:31.946
Fester,
come out here.

233
00:14:32.021 --> 00:14:33.785
He's very shy.

234
00:14:33.857 --> 00:14:37.386
Fester, this is Miss Jellinsky,
our new nanny.

235
00:14:37.463 --> 00:14:39.455
Hello, Fester.

236
00:14:42.471 --> 00:14:45.066
These Addams men,
where do you find them?

237
00:14:45.141 --> 00:14:46.974
It has to be damp.

238
00:14:48.146 --> 00:14:49.580
I can't wait.

239
00:14:49.649 --> 00:14:51.811
I'll start first thing
tomorrow.

240
00:14:54.256 --> 00:14:56.725
Why not tonight?

241
00:15:05.106 --> 00:15:06.267
Good night, Debbie.

242
00:15:06.342 --> 00:15:07.935
Good night!

243
00:15:08.011 --> 00:15:11.004
Scream if you need
anything.

244
00:15:11.083 --> 00:15:13.450
So we've hired
Miss Jellinsky.

245
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.046
She's a gem,
don't you think?

246
00:15:16.123 --> 00:15:17.284
She's perfect.

247
00:15:17.359 --> 00:15:20.922
Oh, Fester,
I'm such a lucky man.

248
00:15:20.998 --> 00:15:24.060
I hope that someday you'll know
the indescribable joy

249
00:15:24.136 --> 00:15:25.968
of having children

250
00:15:26.039 --> 00:15:29.101
and of paying someone else
to raise them.

251
00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:31.113
First wouldn't I
have to get married?

252
00:15:31.181 --> 00:15:35.177
You're just a boy.
There's plenty of time.

253
00:15:35.254 --> 00:15:38.156
You'll meet someone,
someone very special,

254
00:15:38.225 --> 00:15:40.251
someone
who won't press charges.

255
00:15:40.329 --> 00:15:42.161
Oh, I'd like that.

256
00:15:42.232 --> 00:15:44.064
You rascal.

257
00:15:46.405 --> 00:15:50.708
Oh, and what's this?

258
00:15:54.218 --> 00:15:56.551
- Mom.
- Mom.

259
00:16:02.497 --> 00:16:06.834
Tonight on America's
Most Disgusting Unsolved Crimes,

260
00:16:06.904 --> 00:16:10.899
we investigate
the case of Ursula...

261
00:16:10.977 --> 00:16:11.977
Carmen...

262
00:16:12.046 --> 00:16:13.446
and Nadine...

263
00:16:13.515 --> 00:16:17.476
three very different women
with one thing in common...

264
00:16:17.554 --> 00:16:18.749
murder!

265
00:16:18.823 --> 00:16:21.486
And they're all
the same woman.

266
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.360
She's known by the police
as the Black Widow.

267
00:16:24.432 --> 00:16:26.230
She mates,
then she kills.

268
00:16:26.301 --> 00:16:27.792
She investigates
wealthy men,

269
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.862
finding the richest,
loneliest bachelors,

270
00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.502
gaining their trust
and their love,

271
00:16:32.578 --> 00:16:35.241
and finally,
she marries them.

272
00:16:35.315 --> 00:16:37.785
Then, on the wedding night,
she kills them.

273
00:16:37.853 --> 00:16:40.516
The deaths
appear accidental.

274
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:43.083
After the funeral,
she disappears, cash in hand,

275
00:16:43.161 --> 00:16:45.323
but the money
never lasts.

276
00:16:45.398 --> 00:16:48.426
Soon the Black Widow
is hungry again,

277
00:16:48.503 --> 00:16:51.030
hungry for cash,
hungry for love.

278
00:16:51.108 --> 00:16:54.237
A mistress of disguise,
she's eluded the authorities for years.

279
00:16:54.312 --> 00:16:55.974
Who is she,

280
00:16:56.048 --> 00:16:59.110
and what seemingly innocent pose
will she next assume?

281
00:16:59.186 --> 00:17:00.654
All we can say is...

282
00:17:00.722 --> 00:17:02.520
bachelors, beware.

283
00:17:35.644 --> 00:17:38.581
We'll be going out
for most of the morning.

284
00:17:38.649 --> 00:17:40.140
All the important numbers...

285
00:17:40.218 --> 00:17:42.207
police, fire department,
morgue.

286
00:17:44.645 --> 00:17:46.477
Fester, come along.

287
00:17:47.782 --> 00:17:49.547
Goodbye, Fester.

288
00:17:49.619 --> 00:17:52.555
Say goodbye to Debbie.

289
00:17:58.233 --> 00:17:59.723
Have fun!

290
00:18:04.242 --> 00:18:08.010
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm!

291
00:18:08.081 --> 00:18:11.981
Fester Addams. My, my.

292
00:18:12.148 --> 00:18:14.174
Stocks and bonds...

293
00:18:14.251 --> 00:18:16.413
deeds...

294
00:18:16.487 --> 00:18:17.819
gold bullion.

295
00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:30.199
Treasury bills...

296
00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:31.904
IRAs.

297
00:18:36.319 --> 00:18:39.586
What a strange old house.

298
00:18:39.658 --> 00:18:41.354
It's so drafty.

299
00:18:41.427 --> 00:18:44.420
It's really no place
for children.

300
00:18:48.538 --> 00:18:51.099
No place at all.

301
00:18:53.346 --> 00:18:55.338
Hold still,
you little brat.

302
00:18:55.416 --> 00:18:57.078
He's not a brat.

303
00:18:59.922 --> 00:19:03.382
Of course not.
He's an adorable little baby.

304
00:19:03.461 --> 00:19:05.089
Fine. Rub it in.

305
00:19:05.164 --> 00:19:06.928
We're getting him
all ready

306
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.936
for a nice little walk.

307
00:19:09.004 --> 00:19:10.973
Would you like to come?

308
00:19:11.041 --> 00:19:12.771
Are you really a nanny?

309
00:19:12.843 --> 00:19:15.312
What a question.

310
00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.973
Why did you come here?

311
00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:21.990
Why, to take care of you...

312
00:19:22.058 --> 00:19:24.152
all of you.

313
00:19:24.227 --> 00:19:26.129
Especially my uncle?

314
00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.813
I shouldn't be
telling you this.

315
00:19:36.881 --> 00:19:38.873
They swore me
to secrecy,

316
00:19:38.951 --> 00:19:40.613
the little angels,

317
00:19:40.687 --> 00:19:42.178
but they want to go.

318
00:19:42.256 --> 00:19:44.748
It's all they talked about
all morning.

319
00:19:44.827 --> 00:19:46.820
They're just afraid
to ask you.

320
00:19:46.897 --> 00:19:49.833
They're afraid you'll think
they don't love you.

321
00:19:49.901 --> 00:19:51.665
The poor things.

322
00:19:51.738 --> 00:19:53.434
It's a bizarre request.

323
00:19:53.507 --> 00:19:55.032
It's horrifying.

324
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.580
They have their hearts
set on it.

325
00:19:57.647 --> 00:19:59.673
I knew
you'd want to know

326
00:19:59.751 --> 00:20:01.652
as concerned,
caring parents.

327
00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.712
Oh, Gomez,
what shall we do?

328
00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:05.281
How can we say no?

329
00:20:05.359 --> 00:20:06.759
Don't even mention it.

330
00:20:06.828 --> 00:20:08.558
Just do it.

331
00:20:08.631 --> 00:20:10.623
I'm sure
they'll deny everything,

332
00:20:10.701 --> 00:20:12.728
but they want to go,

333
00:20:12.805 --> 00:20:14.067
God love them.

334
00:20:15.943 --> 00:20:18.242
- Summer camp.
- Summer camp.

335
00:20:20.984 --> 00:20:22.384
"Camp Chippewa."

336
00:20:22.453 --> 00:20:23.614
How charming.

337
00:20:23.688 --> 00:20:25.520
What's a chippewa?

338
00:20:25.591 --> 00:20:27.583
It's an old
Indian word.

339
00:20:27.661 --> 00:20:29.095
It means orphan.

340
00:20:31.434 --> 00:20:32.561
Fresh air...

341
00:20:32.636 --> 00:20:35.539
the scent of pine.

342
00:20:35.607 --> 00:20:39.101
Wednesday,
look at all of the other children...

343
00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.776
their freckles,
their bright little eyes,

344
00:20:41.851 --> 00:20:43.752
their eager,
friendly smiles.

345
00:20:43.821 --> 00:20:46.120
Help them.

346
00:20:46.191 --> 00:20:47.682
Hi. I'm Amanda Buckman.

347
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.093
Why are you dressed
like that?

348
00:20:50.163 --> 00:20:51.426
Like what?

349
00:20:51.499 --> 00:20:53.730
Like you're going
to a funeral.

350
00:20:53.802 --> 00:20:56.329
Why are you dressed
like somebody died?

351
00:20:56.407 --> 00:20:57.568
Wait.

352
00:20:58.677 --> 00:21:00.669
Hi. Don Buckman.

353
00:21:00.747 --> 00:21:02.511
Isn't this place
something else?

354
00:21:02.584 --> 00:21:03.881
Very exclusive.

355
00:21:03.952 --> 00:21:07.014
A kid has to be
extra special to get in,

356
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:08.251
gifted, exceptional.

357
00:21:08.326 --> 00:21:10.625
Our Amanda's already
skipped two grades.

358
00:21:10.696 --> 00:21:12.460
How about your boy?

359
00:21:12.532 --> 00:21:14.364
Probation.

360
00:21:14.435 --> 00:21:16.268
We just love Chippewa.

361
00:21:16.339 --> 00:21:17.772
Amanda couldn't wait.

362
00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.833
It's all
she talked about.

363
00:21:19.911 --> 00:21:22.437
She's got
a whole new wardrobe.

364
00:21:22.515 --> 00:21:24.143
And this little lady?

365
00:21:24.217 --> 00:21:26.186
Wednesday's at
that very special age

366
00:21:26.254 --> 00:21:29.623
when a girl has
only one thing on her mind.

367
00:21:29.692 --> 00:21:31.787
Boys?

368
00:21:31.863 --> 00:21:33.160
Homicide.

369
00:21:35.536 --> 00:21:36.536
Attention!

370
00:21:36.603 --> 00:21:38.435
Hey! Listen up,
everybody.

371
00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:40.202
I'm Gary Granger!

372
00:21:40.276 --> 00:21:43.874
And I'm
Becky Martin-Granger.

373
00:21:45.217 --> 00:21:47.983
We're the owners and directors
here at Camp Chippewa,

374
00:21:48.055 --> 00:21:49.318
America's foremost
facility for...

375
00:21:49.391 --> 00:21:51.223
privileged young adults.

376
00:21:51.294 --> 00:21:55.062
And we're all here
to learn, to grow,

377
00:21:55.133 --> 00:21:58.195
and to just plain
have fun!

378
00:21:58.271 --> 00:22:01.106
'Cause that's what being
privileged is all about.

379
00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.212
Buffy!

380
00:22:05.282 --> 00:22:06.614
How are you?

381
00:22:06.685 --> 00:22:08.483
I'm fine.
How are you?

382
00:22:08.554 --> 00:22:10.022
How are you doing?

383
00:22:12.093 --> 00:22:14.585
I don't think
I like it here.

384
00:22:14.663 --> 00:22:17.156
Do you know
how dirty you are?

385
00:22:17.234 --> 00:22:18.793
Please leave him alone.

386
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.304
I can't breathe.

387
00:22:20.373 --> 00:22:21.898
Stand up straight,
please.

388
00:22:21.976 --> 00:22:24.502
This is why
he's always sick.

389
00:22:24.579 --> 00:22:26.741
Don't start with me.

390
00:22:26.816 --> 00:22:29.753
This has nothing to do
with allergies.

391
00:22:29.821 --> 00:22:31.084
You did this.

392
00:22:31.156 --> 00:22:32.818
Can you breathe?

393
00:22:32.892 --> 00:22:34.952
Stand up straight.
Stand up straight.

394
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:36.895
"Everyone at the ball

395
00:22:36.965 --> 00:22:39.765
"turned and stared
at Cinderella.

396
00:22:39.837 --> 00:22:43.502
"Who is that beautiful woman?
everyone asked.

397
00:22:43.576 --> 00:22:46.741
"Even Prince Charming
noticed the new arrival.

398
00:22:46.814 --> 00:22:49.580
"Who are you?
he asked Cinderella.

399
00:22:53.091 --> 00:22:57.223
"My name is Cinderella,
she said to the prince.

400
00:22:57.297 --> 00:22:59.129
"Could you tell me

401
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.037
"who is that man
over by the punch bowl,

402
00:23:03.107 --> 00:23:05.133
"that fascinating man,

403
00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:08.841
"that oddly sensual man,

404
00:23:08.916 --> 00:23:14.516
"that man who makes me
quiver under my bodice,

405
00:23:14.591 --> 00:23:16.993
that baldman?"

406
00:23:24.374 --> 00:23:26.002
She's driving me wild!

407
00:23:26.077 --> 00:23:27.077
Who?

408
00:23:27.145 --> 00:23:28.442
Debbie.
Debbie.

409
00:23:28.513 --> 00:23:30.881
Even the sound
of her name...

410
00:23:30.951 --> 00:23:31.975
Debbie.

411
00:23:32.052 --> 00:23:33.543
Isn't it beautiful?

412
00:23:33.621 --> 00:23:36.820
She makes me think of vinyl.
Chemicals!

413
00:23:36.893 --> 00:23:38.259
Truly, Fester,

414
00:23:38.329 --> 00:23:40.821
has it finally happened,
at long last?

415
00:23:40.899 --> 00:23:42.766
I don't know.
I think so.

416
00:23:42.837 --> 00:23:46.434
All these years
I've watched you and Morticia

417
00:23:46.509 --> 00:23:47.943
through windows,
doorways,

418
00:23:48.011 --> 00:23:49.011
keyholes.

419
00:23:49.079 --> 00:23:51.845
I've been so happy
for you,

420
00:23:51.917 --> 00:23:54.979
but I have to confess
I've been jealous, too.

421
00:23:55.056 --> 00:23:56.888
I've dreamed
that sometime

422
00:23:56.959 --> 00:23:59.053
there might be
someone for me.

423
00:23:59.129 --> 00:24:00.129
There's Thing.

424
00:24:00.197 --> 00:24:03.430
I know,
but I want more...

425
00:24:03.503 --> 00:24:05.165
legs, elbows,

426
00:24:05.239 --> 00:24:06.832
a head.

427
00:24:06.908 --> 00:24:09.104
Two legs?

428
00:24:09.178 --> 00:24:13.116
Dare I ask Debbie
to dinner?

429
00:24:13.184 --> 00:24:14.777
What if she says no?

430
00:24:14.853 --> 00:24:16.219
What if she says yes?

431
00:24:16.289 --> 00:24:19.454
If I asked her,
would you come,

432
00:24:19.528 --> 00:24:20.962
you and Morticia?

433
00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:22.362
Of course.

434
00:24:30.011 --> 00:24:31.138
Life saving.

435
00:24:31.213 --> 00:24:33.512
We're all
top-notch swimmers.

436
00:24:33.583 --> 00:24:35.814
Now we show our stuff

437
00:24:35.886 --> 00:24:38.857
and earn
those certificates.

438
00:24:38.925 --> 00:24:41.623
How about
our first little pair

439
00:24:41.696 --> 00:24:43.426
of life saving buddies?

440
00:24:43.499 --> 00:24:45.127
Amanda, Wednesday.

441
00:24:45.202 --> 00:24:47.398
Is that
your bathing suit?

442
00:24:47.471 --> 00:24:49.337
Is that your over bite?

443
00:24:49.408 --> 00:24:52.470
One of you will be
the drowning victim.

444
00:24:52.546 --> 00:24:54.777
The other one
will be our lifesaver.

445
00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:56.682
I'll be the victim.

446
00:24:56.753 --> 00:24:58.015
All your life.

447
00:24:58.088 --> 00:24:59.886
I'm going to be
an actress.

448
00:24:59.958 --> 00:25:01.951
Brava!

449
00:25:02.028 --> 00:25:05.123
Now jump in,
swim out a few yards,

450
00:25:05.199 --> 00:25:07.396
and start drowning.

451
00:25:09.573 --> 00:25:10.734
Help me!

452
00:25:10.809 --> 00:25:11.969
Help me!

453
00:25:12.043 --> 00:25:13.443
I'm drowning!

454
00:25:13.512 --> 00:25:14.844
Help me!

455
00:25:14.915 --> 00:25:16.907
I'm dying!

456
00:25:18.554 --> 00:25:20.318
I can't swim.

457
00:25:47.833 --> 00:25:49.426
It's our favorite bistro.

458
00:25:49.503 --> 00:25:50.596
We've been coming here
for years.

459
00:25:50.672 --> 00:25:53.141
Of course,
it has been redone.

460
00:25:53.208 --> 00:25:54.642
Oh, it's just...

461
00:25:54.711 --> 00:25:55.940
lovely.

462
00:25:56.013 --> 00:25:58.141
Isn't it, Fester?

463
00:26:00.286 --> 00:26:01.652
Fester.

464
00:26:08.333 --> 00:26:10.963
It's a quaint
French custom...

465
00:26:11.037 --> 00:26:12.596
sharing half-eaten bread.

466
00:26:12.673 --> 00:26:15.108
Fester is truly
continental.

467
00:26:15.177 --> 00:26:17.305
He spent
many years abroad.

468
00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.782
He speaks 12 languages
fluently.

469
00:26:19.851 --> 00:26:21.149
I could tell.

470
00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.086
When I first
saw him,

471
00:26:23.156 --> 00:26:24.988
I thought
he was from Europe.

472
00:26:25.059 --> 00:26:26.151
You did?

473
00:26:26.227 --> 00:26:27.286
It's true.

474
00:26:27.363 --> 00:26:29.925
But I took a bath.

475
00:26:35.976 --> 00:26:37.968
Fester's really
a wonderful man.

476
00:26:38.046 --> 00:26:40.642
He's just terribly shy.

477
00:26:40.717 --> 00:26:42.379
I just can't tell...

478
00:26:42.453 --> 00:26:44.820
does he like me
at all?

479
00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:46.358
Of course he does.

480
00:26:46.426 --> 00:26:47.621
He vomited.

481
00:26:47.695 --> 00:26:50.757
Does he always do that
with women he likes?

482
00:26:50.833 --> 00:26:52.131
Oh, no.

483
00:26:52.202 --> 00:26:53.829
Just you.

484
00:26:53.905 --> 00:26:55.999
Ah.

485
00:26:56.075 --> 00:26:57.839
Do you think she minded?

486
00:26:57.911 --> 00:26:59.539
Of course not.

487
00:26:59.614 --> 00:27:00.946
She adores you.

488
00:27:01.016 --> 00:27:04.215
I'm making
such a mess of things.

489
00:27:04.288 --> 00:27:07.053
Gomez, how do you do it?

490
00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:09.493
How can I be like you?

491
00:27:09.563 --> 00:27:12.226
How can I be suave?

492
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.462
Woo her, admire her,

493
00:27:14.538 --> 00:27:19.706
make her feel like she's
the most sublime creature on Earth.

494
00:27:19.779 --> 00:27:22.271
Yes. That's it?

495
00:27:22.349 --> 00:27:23.476
We're back,

496
00:27:23.552 --> 00:27:25.248
noses powdered.

497
00:27:28.693 --> 00:27:31.322
Perfection
achieved.

498
00:27:33.166 --> 00:27:36.331
We are the luckiest
brothers on Earth.

499
00:27:36.405 --> 00:27:39.843
We are unworthy
of such splendor,

500
00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:42.745
undeserving
of such radiance.

501
00:27:46.921 --> 00:27:48.184
Uh, that's right.

502
00:27:48.257 --> 00:27:52.594
We should have...
ugly girls.

503
00:29:56.326 --> 00:29:57.988
Hah!

504
00:30:40.162 --> 00:30:42.757
And then
the ghost said,

505
00:30:42.832 --> 00:30:46.235
"And I will
haunt you forever."

506
00:30:46.304 --> 00:30:47.966
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

507
00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.338
Wednesday,

508
00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:52.404
you have to continue
the ghost story.

509
00:30:52.481 --> 00:30:53.642
This is dumb.

510
00:30:53.717 --> 00:30:56.346
Well, if you
can't do it...

511
00:31:01.562 --> 00:31:03.794
And, so, the next night,

512
00:31:03.866 --> 00:31:06.859
the ghost returned
to the haunted cabin,

513
00:31:06.937 --> 00:31:09.567
and he said
to the campers,

514
00:31:09.642 --> 00:31:12.009
"None of you
really believe in me,

515
00:31:12.078 --> 00:31:14.674
so I'll have
to prove my power."

516
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:16.548
And the next morning,

517
00:31:16.619 --> 00:31:19.852
when the campers woke up,

518
00:31:19.925 --> 00:31:23.624
all of their old noses
had grown back.

519
00:31:23.697 --> 00:31:29.731
- Aah!
- Aah!

520
00:31:47.068 --> 00:31:48.593
Oh, Fester,

521
00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:50.935
how you
must hate me.

522
00:31:51.007 --> 00:31:53.238
What?

523
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:54.869
Here you are,

524
00:31:54.946 --> 00:31:57.576
a debonair
man of the world.

525
00:31:57.651 --> 00:32:00.086
How I must bore you.

526
00:32:00.154 --> 00:32:02.590
Oh, never.

527
00:32:02.659 --> 00:32:06.290
Fester, before
we go any further,

528
00:32:06.365 --> 00:32:08.630
I have a confession,

529
00:32:08.701 --> 00:32:10.727
something
I must tell you.

530
00:32:14.711 --> 00:32:16.907
I'm a virgin.

531
00:32:16.981 --> 00:32:18.108
You are?

532
00:32:18.183 --> 00:32:19.275
Yes.

533
00:32:19.351 --> 00:32:20.512
What's that?

534
00:32:22.323 --> 00:32:23.586
It... It's someone

535
00:32:23.659 --> 00:32:28.497
who's never experienced
physical love.

536
00:32:28.567 --> 00:32:31.366
Oh.

537
00:32:31.437 --> 00:32:33.566
You mean,
with another person.

538
00:32:36.646 --> 00:32:38.079
Then, Debbie,

539
00:32:38.148 --> 00:32:41.210
I have a confession
to make, as well.

540
00:32:41.286 --> 00:32:42.652
I'm one, too.

541
00:32:42.722 --> 00:32:44.918
You? You?

542
00:32:44.992 --> 00:32:46.051
Yes.

543
00:32:46.127 --> 00:32:49.428
But with your looks,
your charm,

544
00:32:49.499 --> 00:32:51.730
women must
follow you everywhere.

545
00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:53.294
Store detectives.

546
00:32:53.372 --> 00:32:55.238
Oh, Fester,

547
00:32:55.308 --> 00:32:56.742
I always dreamed

548
00:32:56.811 --> 00:32:59.873
of meeting
someone untouched,

549
00:32:59.949 --> 00:33:01.941
someone pure,

550
00:33:02.019 --> 00:33:04.854
someone...
just like you.

551
00:33:04.924 --> 00:33:06.620
You'll meet him.

552
00:33:06.693 --> 00:33:11.895
And... And I dreamed
that when I met him,

553
00:33:11.968 --> 00:33:15.497
that we would wait
until our wedding night

554
00:33:15.574 --> 00:33:17.976
to give ourselves
to one another,

555
00:33:18.045 --> 00:33:21.277
to make
the ultimate sacrifice.

556
00:33:21.349 --> 00:33:23.148
A goat?

557
00:33:24.889 --> 00:33:27.358
Until now I thought
it was impossible,

558
00:33:27.426 --> 00:33:29.657
but, Fester Addams,

559
00:33:29.729 --> 00:33:31.698
I love you.

560
00:33:33.301 --> 00:33:35.271
You do?

561
00:33:35.339 --> 00:33:39.141
Please, I have to know
how you feel about me.

562
00:33:39.211 --> 00:33:41.510
I love you.

563
00:33:41.581 --> 00:33:42.981
I worship you.

564
00:33:43.051 --> 00:33:44.781
I'd do anything for you.

565
00:33:44.853 --> 00:33:46.185
I'd pay.

566
00:33:46.256 --> 00:33:47.781
Fester!

567
00:33:47.858 --> 00:33:48.858
Debbie!

568
00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.565
Oh.

569
00:33:55.637 --> 00:33:57.162
Oh.

570
00:33:57.239 --> 00:33:58.730
Oh.

571
00:33:58.809 --> 00:34:00.004
Oh.

572
00:34:00.078 --> 00:34:01.478
Look at him.

573
00:34:01.547 --> 00:34:03.743
So peaceful.

574
00:34:05.252 --> 00:34:08.314
This evening
as I watched Fester and Debbie,

575
00:34:08.391 --> 00:34:10.622
I kept
my fingers crossed.

576
00:34:10.694 --> 00:34:11.787
I hoped...

577
00:34:11.863 --> 00:34:12.955
I prayed.

578
00:34:13.031 --> 00:34:15.058
Let them
fall in love.

579
00:34:15.135 --> 00:34:16.967
Let them know happiness.

580
00:34:17.038 --> 00:34:18.164
Let them adopt.

581
00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:20.334
Gomez, Morticia,

582
00:34:20.410 --> 00:34:22.140
great news...

583
00:34:22.213 --> 00:34:24.682
Something impossible,
a miracle.

584
00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:26.480
- The rash...
- It's gone.

585
00:34:26.552 --> 00:34:29.250
I'm engaged.

586
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:34.058
That ring...

587
00:34:34.132 --> 00:34:36.863
It was our mother's.
She was buried with it.

588
00:34:46.284 --> 00:34:48.276
Mail call.

589
00:34:48.354 --> 00:34:49.515
Addams.

590
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:51.490
Barkley,
Castleman, Calloway,

591
00:34:51.559 --> 00:34:53.721
Dexter, Donman,

592
00:34:53.796 --> 00:34:56.027
Edwards, Evans,

593
00:34:56.099 --> 00:34:58.899
Finley, Fisher,
Framingham...

594
00:34:58.970 --> 00:34:59.995
Oh, no.

595
00:35:00.072 --> 00:35:01.665
What is it?

596
00:35:01.742 --> 00:35:03.218
This is unspeakable.

597
00:35:03.385 --> 00:35:05.251
Is something wrong?
Bad news?

598
00:35:05.321 --> 00:35:09.123
It's the worst thing ever
in the history of human events.

599
00:35:09.194 --> 00:35:11.561
Uncle Fester
is getting married.

600
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:12.723
A wedding?

601
00:35:12.799 --> 00:35:14.267
But that's
great news.

602
00:35:14.335 --> 00:35:15.394
To whom?

603
00:35:15.471 --> 00:35:16.563
The nanny.

604
00:35:16.638 --> 00:35:19.006
Get out of the cabin.

605
00:35:19.076 --> 00:35:20.305
I'd kill myself.

606
00:35:20.378 --> 00:35:21.538
The help?

607
00:35:21.613 --> 00:35:24.379
I'm sure
she's a very nice lady.

608
00:35:24.451 --> 00:35:26.716
I think
that's disgusting.

609
00:35:26.788 --> 00:35:28.051
Their whole family's

610
00:35:28.123 --> 00:35:30.558
like some weird
medical experiment.

611
00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:32.961
I think they're
like circus people.

612
00:35:33.031 --> 00:35:34.397
What did you say?

613
00:35:34.467 --> 00:35:36.163
Tempers.

614
00:35:36.237 --> 00:35:37.397
Group hug.

615
00:35:43.715 --> 00:35:45.650
Wednesday.

616
00:35:47.387 --> 00:35:48.719
Pugsley.

617
00:35:50.425 --> 00:35:52.656
Will a hug hurt us?

618
00:35:52.729 --> 00:35:53.992
We don't hug.

619
00:35:54.064 --> 00:35:56.158
Oh, they're
just shy.

620
00:35:56.234 --> 00:35:57.668
We're not shy.

621
00:35:57.737 --> 00:35:59.137
We're contagious.

622
00:36:00.775 --> 00:36:04.838
I'm sensing
some friction here,

623
00:36:04.915 --> 00:36:06.817
something
not quite Chippewa.

624
00:36:06.885 --> 00:36:07.943
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

625
00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:09.318
Hey, no problem-o.

626
00:36:09.389 --> 00:36:12.588
All they need are
good friends, good fun,

627
00:36:12.661 --> 00:36:15.860
and a little time
in the harmony hut.

628
00:36:18.603 --> 00:36:21.472
How long do we have
to stay in here?

629
00:36:21.541 --> 00:36:23.032
Until we crack.

630
00:36:26.249 --> 00:36:28.411
Have fun.

631
00:36:28.485 --> 00:36:30.716
What are you in for?

632
00:36:30.789 --> 00:36:32.691
I wouldn't go
horseback riding.

633
00:36:32.759 --> 00:36:34.523
That's all?

634
00:36:34.596 --> 00:36:37.897
And I wouldn't
make a bird house.

635
00:36:37.968 --> 00:36:39.094
Why not?

636
00:36:39.169 --> 00:36:41.035
I just wanted to read.

637
00:36:41.105 --> 00:36:44.042
Not on my time,
four-eyes.

638
00:36:48.751 --> 00:36:50.310
Aah!

639
00:36:50.387 --> 00:36:53.620
Aah aah aah!

640
00:36:55.028 --> 00:36:56.188
Hurry up.

641
00:36:56.262 --> 00:36:57.457
I'm coming.

642
00:36:58.567 --> 00:37:00.399
Wait.

643
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:01.732
Be careful.

644
00:37:01.804 --> 00:37:02.829
Tetanus.

645
00:37:04.376 --> 00:37:05.503
There they are!

646
00:37:05.578 --> 00:37:07.706
I saw them
sneak out.

647
00:37:12.288 --> 00:37:14.154
What do you think
you're doing?

648
00:37:14.225 --> 00:37:16.126
We have to see
our family.

649
00:37:16.194 --> 00:37:17.252
It's important.

650
00:37:17.329 --> 00:37:19.697
More important
than summer fun?

651
00:37:19.767 --> 00:37:22.328
More important
than making new friends?

652
00:37:22.404 --> 00:37:25.273
More important
than sharing?

653
00:37:25.342 --> 00:37:28.313
Joel Glicker,
I'm surprised at you.

654
00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.679
I have to
get out of here.

655
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:32.150
I have allergies.

656
00:37:32.219 --> 00:37:33.653
Oh, you're allergic?

657
00:37:33.722 --> 00:37:35.714
To sunshine,
archery, and crafts?

658
00:37:35.792 --> 00:37:37.090
Yes.

659
00:37:37.161 --> 00:37:39.392
I think
they should be punished.

660
00:37:39.464 --> 00:37:41.262
Punished! Punished!

661
00:37:41.333 --> 00:37:42.596
Punished! Punished!

662
00:37:42.669 --> 00:37:45.037
Punished! Punished!

663
00:37:45.107 --> 00:37:48.442
No! We are not here
to punish.

664
00:37:48.512 --> 00:37:51.277
We are here to inspire.

665
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:54.320
Know what our little
ninja friends need?

666
00:37:54.388 --> 00:37:58.451
Know what might turn
their sad, wasted lives around?

667
00:37:58.527 --> 00:38:00.690
What?

668
00:38:03.135 --> 00:38:06.436
~ Kumbaya, my Lord ~

669
00:38:06.507 --> 00:38:08.874
~ Kumbaya ~

670
00:38:08.944 --> 00:38:12.404
~ Kumbaya, my Lord ~

671
00:38:12.483 --> 00:38:14.179
~ Kumbaya ~

672
00:38:16.022 --> 00:38:18.719
~ Kumbaya, my Lord ~

673
00:38:18.793 --> 00:38:21.662
~ Kumbaya ~

674
00:38:21.731 --> 00:38:26.398
~ Oh, Lord, Kumbaya ~~

675
00:38:32.181 --> 00:38:34.810
Now, Debbie,
have you met everyone?

676
00:38:34.885 --> 00:38:36.114
Morticia.

677
00:38:36.187 --> 00:38:37.416
Margaret.

678
00:38:38.758 --> 00:38:41.626
Margaret, this is
our bride-to-be.

679
00:38:41.695 --> 00:38:44.063
Welcome
to our family.

680
00:38:44.133 --> 00:38:46.125
I can't tell you
what it's meant

681
00:38:46.203 --> 00:38:48.035
joining
the Addams clan.

682
00:38:48.106 --> 00:38:50.166
Have you met my husband
Cousin Itt?

683
00:38:50.242 --> 00:38:51.801
Cousin Itt?

684
00:38:51.878 --> 00:38:54.007
We've been so happy,

685
00:38:54.082 --> 00:38:56.711
and, just as little
Pubert arrived,

686
00:38:56.786 --> 00:39:00.554
we were blessed with
our own little bundle of joy.

687
00:39:06.135 --> 00:39:08.070
What?

688
00:39:08.138 --> 00:39:10.937
Oh, I didn't say anything.

689
00:39:11.008 --> 00:39:14.241
That's the baby's
nickname... What?

690
00:39:14.314 --> 00:39:15.543
From
the obstetrician.

691
00:39:15.616 --> 00:39:17.585
Isn't he precious?

692
00:39:17.652 --> 00:39:19.678
We've had offers.

693
00:39:19.756 --> 00:39:23.592
~ For he's
a jolly good fellow ~

694
00:39:23.662 --> 00:39:27.361
~ Which nobody
can deny ~~

695
00:39:27.435 --> 00:39:30.998
You guys are the best
bunch of friends

696
00:39:31.074 --> 00:39:33.305
a fella could hope for.

697
00:39:33.377 --> 00:39:34.902
What a party!

698
00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:39.784
And now for
the piece de resistance.

699
00:39:45.296 --> 00:39:47.060
Ta-da!

700
00:39:54.711 --> 00:39:57.705
Ta-da!

701
00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:12.832
That poor girl.

702
00:40:12.906 --> 00:40:17.039
Lurch, was she in there
before you baked?

703
00:40:23.524 --> 00:40:25.584
So, so, so.

704
00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:26.752
C'est la vie.

705
00:40:28.297 --> 00:40:30.893
Ha ha ha ha!

706
00:40:32.137 --> 00:40:33.833
Are you really allergic?

707
00:40:33.907 --> 00:40:35.101
Uh-huh.

708
00:40:35.175 --> 00:40:36.871
To almost
everything.

709
00:40:36.944 --> 00:40:38.776
No, you're not.

710
00:40:38.847 --> 00:40:39.940
Am, too.

711
00:40:40.016 --> 00:40:42.212
I can't have
dairy products

712
00:40:42.286 --> 00:40:43.754
or wear wool

713
00:40:43.822 --> 00:40:45.552
or drink
fluoridated water.

714
00:40:45.624 --> 00:40:47.286
You know
what happens

715
00:40:47.361 --> 00:40:50.196
if my mom uses
a fabric softener?

716
00:40:50.265 --> 00:40:51.265
What?

717
00:40:51.334 --> 00:40:52.596
I die.

718
00:41:02.752 --> 00:41:04.015
Where are you?

719
00:41:04.087 --> 00:41:05.350
Over here.

720
00:41:05.423 --> 00:41:06.686
Where?

721
00:41:06.759 --> 00:41:08.625
By the skeleton.

722
00:41:12.901 --> 00:41:15.770
I got your message
inside my cutlet.

723
00:41:15.839 --> 00:41:17.865
I need to ask you
something.

724
00:41:17.942 --> 00:41:19.137
What?

725
00:41:19.211 --> 00:41:22.808
Do you believe
in the existence of evil?

726
00:41:22.884 --> 00:41:25.684
Well, did you meet
my mom?

727
00:41:25.755 --> 00:41:28.316
My Uncle Fester's
about to get married

728
00:41:28.392 --> 00:41:30.692
to this woman
in a white uniform.

729
00:41:30.763 --> 00:41:31.923
A radiologist.

730
00:41:31.998 --> 00:41:33.489
A nanny.

731
00:41:33.567 --> 00:41:36.094
I have to go
to the wedding.

732
00:41:36.172 --> 00:41:38.801
I have a pass.
Want to come?

733
00:41:38.875 --> 00:41:42.210
You mean like...
on a date?

734
00:41:42.281 --> 00:41:43.442
No.

735
00:41:43.516 --> 00:41:45.246
I'd love to.

736
00:42:53.727 --> 00:42:54.698
I,

737
00:42:54.728 --> 00:42:56.526
Fester Addams,

738
00:42:56.598 --> 00:43:00.867
do hereby declare
my unending love.

739
00:43:03.509 --> 00:43:05.741
I will worship you forever.

740
00:43:07.649 --> 00:43:09.242
I will devote...

741
00:43:09.319 --> 00:43:13.223
my every waking moment

742
00:43:13.291 --> 00:43:15.226
to your happiness alone.

743
00:43:18.366 --> 00:43:19.493
Oh.

744
00:43:19.568 --> 00:43:23.028
Henceforth,
I am your eternal

745
00:43:23.107 --> 00:43:24.905
and helpless slave.

746
00:43:27.915 --> 00:43:29.041
Nice.

747
00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:32.785
Ditto.

748
00:43:45.909 --> 00:43:49.244
You're going to have a
wonderful life together.

749
00:43:49.315 --> 00:43:50.908
Yes, I am.

750
00:43:50.984 --> 00:43:52.384
Come, darling,

751
00:43:52.453 --> 00:43:55.583
let's see who's
the next happy bride.

752
00:43:55.659 --> 00:43:56.990
Here, Debbie!

753
00:43:57.061 --> 00:43:58.927
- To me!
- Me!

754
00:43:58.997 --> 00:44:00.863
Oh, I have it!

755
00:44:00.933 --> 00:44:03.995
- No! I have it!
- It's mine!

756
00:44:05.975 --> 00:44:08.137
Now you have
to get married.

757
00:44:08.211 --> 00:44:09.372
It's not binding.

758
00:44:09.447 --> 00:44:10.471
Tramp.

759
00:44:10.548 --> 00:44:13.451
- Bye!
- Congratulations!

760
00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:16.514
- Congratulations!
- Bon voyage!

761
00:44:31.682 --> 00:44:33.674
The key ingredient

762
00:44:33.752 --> 00:44:37.019
to a successful
Hawaiian honeymoon

763
00:44:37.091 --> 00:44:39.185
is romantic music.

764
00:44:42.933 --> 00:44:46.200
I ordered this cassette
from Time-Life.

765
00:44:46.271 --> 00:44:50.266
5,000 of the World's
Most Romantic Melodies.

766
00:44:50.344 --> 00:44:52.814
It's superb.

767
00:44:52.882 --> 00:44:54.817
What do you
call this?

768
00:44:54.885 --> 00:44:57.047
Number 438.

769
00:44:57.122 --> 00:44:58.784
So...

770
00:44:58.858 --> 00:45:01.021
do you like
romantic living?

771
00:45:01.095 --> 00:45:03.826
I do, so far.

772
00:45:03.899 --> 00:45:06.165
I love romantic living.

773
00:45:06.237 --> 00:45:09.207
Oh, Fester, how much
do you love me?

774
00:45:09.274 --> 00:45:10.867
With all my soul.

775
00:45:10.943 --> 00:45:12.673
Would you do
anything for me?

776
00:45:12.746 --> 00:45:14.009
Anything.

777
00:45:14.082 --> 00:45:15.550
Would you die for me?

778
00:45:15.618 --> 00:45:16.916
Yes.

779
00:45:16.987 --> 00:45:19.753
Promise?

780
00:45:19.825 --> 00:45:22.260
Aah!

781
00:45:22.328 --> 00:45:25.731
Aah aah!

782
00:45:25.801 --> 00:45:29.830
Aah aah aah aah!

783
00:45:31.977 --> 00:45:33.741
Pumpkin?

784
00:45:36.884 --> 00:45:39.150
Muffin.

785
00:45:45.465 --> 00:45:50.269
Darling, I know
you're nervous.

786
00:45:50.339 --> 00:45:52.035
So am I.

787
00:45:52.108 --> 00:45:53.508
I'm not nervous.

788
00:45:53.578 --> 00:45:54.944
I'm upset.

789
00:45:55.013 --> 00:45:57.745
Because of the bathtub?

790
00:45:57.818 --> 00:45:59.149
Th-Th...

791
00:46:00.789 --> 00:46:02.724
That was an accident.

792
00:46:02.793 --> 00:46:03.953
I know.

793
00:46:04.027 --> 00:46:05.256
I'm fine.

794
00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:06.457
I know.

795
00:46:06.532 --> 00:46:08.763
Don't give it
another thought.

796
00:46:08.835 --> 00:46:10.861
Don't be frightened.

797
00:46:10.938 --> 00:46:14.900
This is as new to me
as it is to you.

798
00:46:14.979 --> 00:46:17.949
Have you really
never had sex?

799
00:46:18.016 --> 00:46:19.484
Never.

800
00:46:19.552 --> 00:46:24.151
Then how do you know we're
not having it right now?

801
00:46:24.226 --> 00:46:26.821
We'll be just like
Gomez and Morticia.

802
00:46:26.897 --> 00:46:30.096
Pretend we're
at home in my room...

803
00:46:30.168 --> 00:46:31.966
Granny down the hallway,

804
00:46:32.038 --> 00:46:33.700
Lurch by the door.

805
00:46:33.774 --> 00:46:35.710
Oh, my God.

806
00:46:35.778 --> 00:46:37.406
Please, what is it?

807
00:46:37.481 --> 00:46:39.177
What do you need?

808
00:46:43.223 --> 00:46:46.786
Only you, my dearest.

809
00:46:50.568 --> 00:46:52.093
Really?

810
00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:54.538
Fester, I'm ready.

811
00:46:56.544 --> 00:46:59.378
- Just one thing...
- Gomez told me. No giggling.

812
00:46:59.448 --> 00:47:01.007
- And?
- No hand puppets.

813
00:47:01.084 --> 00:47:02.985
- And...
- What?

814
00:47:03.054 --> 00:47:04.784
after we've made love,

815
00:47:04.857 --> 00:47:07.759
you can never see
your family again.

816
00:47:07.828 --> 00:47:09.023
What?

817
00:47:09.097 --> 00:47:12.626
Otherwise, I could never
really enjoy myself.

818
00:47:12.703 --> 00:47:16.038
I could never
give myself completely.

819
00:47:16.108 --> 00:47:19.273
Unless I never see
my family again?

820
00:47:19.347 --> 00:47:22.477
Yes. If I picture them
in our lives,

821
00:47:22.552 --> 00:47:25.785
I could never achieve...
you know.

822
00:47:27.893 --> 00:47:29.020
Never?

823
00:47:29.096 --> 00:47:30.860
Don't you love me?

824
00:47:30.932 --> 00:47:32.194
Of course.

825
00:47:32.266 --> 00:47:34.099
Don't you want me?

826
00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:35.262
Yes.

827
00:47:37.141 --> 00:47:38.507
Never.

828
00:47:41.415 --> 00:47:42.609
Stud.

829
00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.621
Whoa!

830
00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:48.921
Uh...

831
00:47:48.993 --> 00:47:51.520
ahh...

832
00:48:00.945 --> 00:48:03.939
It's so odd we haven't heard
from Fester and Debbie.

833
00:48:04.017 --> 00:48:07.113
It's been almost a week.
Hasn't it, little fellow?

834
00:48:07.189 --> 00:48:09.317
Look at him.

835
00:48:09.392 --> 00:48:12.557
Too much fun
at that reception.

836
00:48:17.906 --> 00:48:19.738
Hair of the pup.

837
00:48:24.116 --> 00:48:26.085
Excellent, Amanda!

838
00:48:26.152 --> 00:48:27.745
Thank you.

839
00:48:27.822 --> 00:48:29.663
Next!

840
00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.700
"Dear Wednesday and Pugsley,

841
00:48:34.771 --> 00:48:36.433
"I love you dearly,

842
00:48:36.507 --> 00:48:38.874
but I can never
see you again."

843
00:48:38.944 --> 00:48:41.608
Glicker, go!

844
00:48:41.682 --> 00:48:43.878
Good try!

845
00:48:46.055 --> 00:48:48.491
"When you are grown-up
and very lonely,

846
00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:50.425
"you'll understand.

847
00:48:50.496 --> 00:48:53.227
Love, Uncle Fester."

848
00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:55.133
He's a dead man.

849
00:48:55.203 --> 00:48:58.071
Go!

850
00:49:03.649 --> 00:49:06.677
It's an American
bald eagle!

851
00:49:06.754 --> 00:49:08.586
But aren't
they extinct?

852
00:49:08.657 --> 00:49:10.216
They are now.

853
00:49:13.899 --> 00:49:14.871
Mrs. Addams?

854
00:49:14.901 --> 00:49:15.873
Yes?

855
00:49:15.903 --> 00:49:17.667
Your hearse.
Where's the body?

856
00:49:17.739 --> 00:49:18.710
Right there.

857
00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:20.174
But he's alive.

858
00:49:20.242 --> 00:49:21.642
Tell me about it!

859
00:49:31.227 --> 00:49:33.719
Fester, we may be
together for a while...

860
00:49:33.797 --> 00:49:35.857
All our lives,
cara mia.

861
00:49:35.934 --> 00:49:36.934
What?

862
00:49:36.969 --> 00:49:37.969
Mon cher.

863
00:49:38.004 --> 00:49:39.199
- Speak English.
- Pumpkin?

864
00:49:40.274 --> 00:49:43.210
If I have to be seen with you,
we need to make some changes.

865
00:49:43.279 --> 00:49:45.180
Changes?

866
00:49:59.304 --> 00:50:02.798
Be careful!
It's a credenza!

867
00:50:02.877 --> 00:50:04.505
These are
beautiful things.

868
00:50:04.579 --> 00:50:06.104
They're
from catalogues.

869
00:50:06.182 --> 00:50:09.084
Fester,
get over here!

870
00:50:12.358 --> 00:50:13.849
It itches.

871
00:50:13.927 --> 00:50:16.989
Don't touch it,
not until the scab falls off.

872
00:50:17.066 --> 00:50:20.128
Pumpkin, do you think
these clothes are really me?

873
00:50:20.204 --> 00:50:22.503
Of course not.
That's the point.

874
00:50:22.574 --> 00:50:26.343
- Where do you want this?
- The second floor boudoir.

875
00:50:26.414 --> 00:50:27.642
I'm her husband.

876
00:50:27.715 --> 00:50:28.687
Fester!

877
00:50:28.717 --> 00:50:30.151
Give me a kiss.

878
00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:32.655
Give me a 20.
Watch it!

879
00:50:32.723 --> 00:50:34.989
That's a Queen Anne
chandelier!

880
00:50:36.396 --> 00:50:38.228
"Hawaii is wonderful.

881
00:50:38.299 --> 00:50:40.292
"I wish you were here,

882
00:50:40.369 --> 00:50:44.137
"and I can never
see you again!

883
00:50:44.209 --> 00:50:45.871
P.S., Debbie says hi."

884
00:50:45.945 --> 00:50:50.441
I don't understand.
For weeks not a word, and now this.

885
00:50:50.519 --> 00:50:53.546
Darling, come to bed.
He can't be serious.

886
00:50:53.623 --> 00:50:55.991
Have I done something,
said something?

887
00:50:56.061 --> 00:50:58.428
Why does my brother
despise me?

888
00:50:58.498 --> 00:51:00.330
He adores you.

889
00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.870
I'd do anything for him.

890
00:51:02.938 --> 00:51:06.000
At his request,
I would rip out my eyes.

891
00:51:06.077 --> 00:51:09.138
At his command,
I would crawl on my belly

892
00:51:09.214 --> 00:51:11.878
through hot coals
and broken glass.

893
00:51:11.952 --> 00:51:13.045
Why wait?

894
00:51:13.121 --> 00:51:14.919
Has Fester gone mad?

895
00:51:14.991 --> 00:51:18.121
This is all just
some sort of phase.

896
00:51:18.196 --> 00:51:19.356
Post-honeymoon malaise.

897
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:22.230
It's very common.

898
00:51:22.302 --> 00:51:24.828
Do you remember
our honeymoon?

899
00:51:24.906 --> 00:51:27.672
That glorious cruise.

900
00:51:27.744 --> 00:51:29.508
No quarrels.

901
00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:30.843
No cares.

902
00:51:30.916 --> 00:51:33.614
No survivors.

903
00:51:33.687 --> 00:51:36.714
Cara mia.

904
00:51:36.791 --> 00:51:38.453
So...

905
00:51:38.527 --> 00:51:41.157
you still desire me
after all these years?

906
00:51:41.232 --> 00:51:43.201
The old ball and chain?

907
00:51:43.268 --> 00:51:44.327
Forever.

908
00:51:45.471 --> 00:51:47.064
I'll get them.

909
00:51:50.012 --> 00:51:52.379
Heads up, campers.
Thejamboree's only two weeks away.

910
00:51:52.449 --> 00:51:55.511
And you know what that means...
clean cabins.

911
00:51:55.588 --> 00:51:57.454
Creating with clay and...

912
00:51:57.524 --> 00:51:59.356
Canoes, canoes, canoes!

913
00:51:59.428 --> 00:52:02.421
So we better
get cracking, huh?

914
00:52:02.498 --> 00:52:05.560
Look at this.
I've got them.

915
00:52:05.637 --> 00:52:07.572
Schizos and Serial Killers.

916
00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:10.167
I have almost
the whole series.

917
00:52:10.245 --> 00:52:14.013
I'm only missing Jack the Ripper
and that Zodiac guy.

918
00:52:14.084 --> 00:52:15.084
But look.

919
00:52:15.152 --> 00:52:16.984
"The Black Widow."

920
00:52:17.055 --> 00:52:18.717
It might be Debbie.

921
00:52:18.791 --> 00:52:22.388
At least three rich husbands...

922
00:52:22.464 --> 00:52:24.262
all dead.

923
00:52:24.333 --> 00:52:25.926
I'll trade you.

924
00:52:26.003 --> 00:52:27.062
For what?

925
00:52:29.942 --> 00:52:31.843
Amy Fischer.

926
00:52:31.911 --> 00:52:34.279
Each year,
we conclude our summer

927
00:52:34.349 --> 00:52:36.875
with a very special
presentation.

928
00:52:36.953 --> 00:52:38.615
Book, music,
and lyrics by...

929
00:52:38.689 --> 00:52:40.590
Gary Granger!

930
00:52:42.194 --> 00:52:43.890
And this year,

931
00:52:43.964 --> 00:52:47.231
the old bean has come up
with something pretty exciting...

932
00:52:47.303 --> 00:52:49.899
my own personal salute
to the first Thanksgiving.

933
00:52:49.974 --> 00:52:53.173
Now, we have thought
long and hard

934
00:52:53.246 --> 00:52:56.376
about choosing
just the right little actress

935
00:52:56.451 --> 00:52:59.444
for the leading role
of Sarah Miller,

936
00:52:59.522 --> 00:53:01.719
our beautiful
and kindly pilgrim lady,

937
00:53:01.793 --> 00:53:04.695
and we have selected...

938
00:53:07.034 --> 00:53:10.597
Amanda Buckman!

939
00:53:10.673 --> 00:53:13.906
And in the roles
of her pilgrim pals...

940
00:53:13.978 --> 00:53:15.776
Lily, Jennifer,
Tiffany, Missy,

941
00:53:15.848 --> 00:53:19.217
Michelle, and Melissa!

942
00:53:21.056 --> 00:53:25.324
But, of course,
not everyone can be a star.

943
00:53:25.396 --> 00:53:28.890
Let's not forget
our cheery little Chippewas

944
00:53:28.969 --> 00:53:31.632
Mordecai, Yang,

945
00:53:31.706 --> 00:53:34.541
Esther...

946
00:53:34.611 --> 00:53:35.611
um...

947
00:53:35.679 --> 00:53:39.618
Consuela, Irwin...

948
00:53:39.686 --> 00:53:40.948
and, um...

949
00:53:41.021 --> 00:53:44.389
I'm still not sure just
how to pronounce this.

950
00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:46.258
Jam-il? Jame-il?

951
00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:47.330
Jamal.

952
00:53:47.398 --> 00:53:48.798
Whatever.

953
00:53:48.867 --> 00:53:52.430
And as their leader
in the secondary

954
00:53:52.506 --> 00:53:56.103
but still compellingly
written role of Pocahontas,

955
00:53:56.178 --> 00:53:59.308
guess who we have in mind.

956
00:53:59.383 --> 00:54:02.411
Our own little
brunette outcast...

957
00:54:02.488 --> 00:54:04.423
Wednesday Addams.

958
00:54:18.847 --> 00:54:22.250
We want to see
Debbie and Fester.

959
00:54:22.319 --> 00:54:25.381
Miss Debbie!

960
00:54:25.458 --> 00:54:26.687
Debra!

961
00:54:28.696 --> 00:54:29.755
Gomez...

962
00:54:29.832 --> 00:54:31.664
where are we?

963
00:54:31.734 --> 00:54:33.930
It looks familiar.

964
00:54:34.004 --> 00:54:36.338
Of course...
the gates of hell.

965
00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:39.737
Welcome to my home.

966
00:54:39.814 --> 00:54:41.373
Might we see my brother?

967
00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:46.185
No. He doesn't want to see
any of you or that.

968
00:54:46.257 --> 00:54:47.316
Why not?

969
00:54:47.392 --> 00:54:49.293
Because he's in love.

970
00:54:49.362 --> 00:54:51.696
He's wrapped in a gossamer
blanket of ecstasy,

971
00:54:51.766 --> 00:54:53.530
and he hates your guts.

972
00:54:53.603 --> 00:54:54.865
But why?

973
00:54:54.937 --> 00:54:56.804
Because you've
flaunted yourselves,

974
00:54:56.875 --> 00:54:59.003
your great love affair.

975
00:54:59.078 --> 00:55:01.547
You kept him a child.

976
00:55:01.615 --> 00:55:03.447
I've made him a man.

977
00:55:03.518 --> 00:55:06.011
Let me hear this
from his own lips.

978
00:55:06.089 --> 00:55:08.490
His lips are busy.

979
00:55:08.559 --> 00:55:10.586
You want to talk
to these people?

980
00:55:10.663 --> 00:55:11.663
Debbie.

981
00:55:15.703 --> 00:55:16.703
Oh.

982
00:55:16.739 --> 00:55:17.739
Go away!

983
00:55:17.807 --> 00:55:19.742
That is not my brother.

984
00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:21.005
Sorry.

985
00:55:21.079 --> 00:55:22.911
You have
enslaved him.

986
00:55:22.982 --> 00:55:24.848
You have
placed Fester

987
00:55:24.919 --> 00:55:26.581
under some strange
sexual spell.

988
00:55:26.655 --> 00:55:30.058
I respect that.
But, please, may we see him?

989
00:55:30.127 --> 00:55:31.755
Don't even
think about it.

990
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:33.354
You have gone
too far.

991
00:55:33.432 --> 00:55:34.923
You have
married Fester.

992
00:55:35.001 --> 00:55:36.492
You have destroyed
his spirit.

993
00:55:36.571 --> 00:55:39.097
You have taken him
from us.

994
00:55:39.174 --> 00:55:40.665
All that
I could forgive.

995
00:55:40.743 --> 00:55:42.041
But, Debbie...

996
00:55:42.112 --> 00:55:43.512
What?

997
00:55:44.783 --> 00:55:45.910
Pastels?

998
00:55:45.985 --> 00:55:48.147
Get out of my house!

999
00:55:48.221 --> 00:55:50.053
Hit the road!

1000
00:55:50.124 --> 00:55:53.357
And if you ever
show your faces around here again,

1001
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:57.335
I'll have you locked up
for trying to visit.

1002
00:55:57.403 --> 00:55:58.529
Right, Fessie?

1003
00:55:58.605 --> 00:55:59.605
Right!

1004
00:56:09.155 --> 00:56:13.321
Luxor, nexor,
burst, and burn!

1005
00:56:13.395 --> 00:56:15.261
What is she doing?

1006
00:56:15.331 --> 00:56:17.961
Just a curse.
Have a nice day.

1007
00:56:22.776 --> 00:56:24.973
I demand justice!

1008
00:56:25.047 --> 00:56:27.346
Someone has married
my brother.

1009
00:56:27.417 --> 00:56:28.851
No.

1010
00:56:28.919 --> 00:56:30.751
She took him to Hawaii.

1011
00:56:30.822 --> 00:56:33.884
They have moved into
a large, expensive home

1012
00:56:33.961 --> 00:56:35.759
where they make love
constantly.

1013
00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:37.560
I hate
when that happens.

1014
00:56:37.633 --> 00:56:39.568
Arrest her at once
without delay.

1015
00:56:39.636 --> 00:56:41.571
- Who?
- Debbie.

1016
00:56:41.639 --> 00:56:45.703
My brother's wife,
the temptress of Waikiki.

1017
00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:46.974
Who are you?

1018
00:56:47.049 --> 00:56:49.484
What are you?
Who moved the rock?

1019
00:56:49.552 --> 00:56:51.544
Officer,
you must issue a subpoena.

1020
00:56:51.622 --> 00:56:53.591
I believe they own...

1021
00:56:53.658 --> 00:56:54.683
Gomez, no!

1022
00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:55.732
A Buick!

1023
00:56:55.762 --> 00:56:57.788
Just leave.
Leave quietly. Leave now.

1024
00:56:57.865 --> 00:57:01.098
Don't make me call
Ringling Brothers.

1025
00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:04.966
Has the planet gone mad?

1026
00:57:06.713 --> 00:57:08.682
My brother... passion's hostage.

1027
00:57:08.749 --> 00:57:10.377
I seek justice.

1028
00:57:10.452 --> 00:57:12.182
Denied.

1029
00:57:12.254 --> 00:57:17.058
I shall not submit.
I shall conquer. I shall rise.

1030
00:57:17.129 --> 00:57:22.536
My name is Gomez Addams,
and I have seen evil!

1031
00:57:22.604 --> 00:57:24.505
I have seen horror!

1032
00:57:26.443 --> 00:57:29.437
I have seen
the unholy maggots

1033
00:57:29.515 --> 00:57:34.148
which feast in the dark recesses
of the human soul!

1034
00:57:34.223 --> 00:57:35.714
They're at camp.

1035
00:57:35.792 --> 00:57:38.455
I have seen all this,
Officer.

1036
00:57:38.529 --> 00:57:40.395
But until today,

1037
00:57:40.466 --> 00:57:43.868
I had never seen...

1038
00:57:45.674 --> 00:57:46.732
you!

1039
00:57:47.811 --> 00:57:52.341
Hook him, book him,
cook him. Now!

1040
00:57:52.417 --> 00:57:54.250
Next in line.

1041
00:57:54.321 --> 00:57:56.847
Yes, I'd like to renew
my passport, please.

1042
00:57:56.925 --> 00:57:58.985
I'll be leaving the country
very shortly.

1043
00:57:59.061 --> 00:58:00.324
Traveling alone?

1044
00:58:00.397 --> 00:58:03.459
Yes. I'll be a widow.

1045
00:58:08.043 --> 00:58:10.012
~ Happy, happy turkey day ~

1046
00:58:10.079 --> 00:58:12.241
~ Hunger pains will go away ~

1047
00:58:12.316 --> 00:58:13.841
~ When you hear
the pilgrims say ~

1048
00:58:13.919 --> 00:58:15.979
~ It's happy turkey day ~

1049
00:58:16.055 --> 00:58:17.956
~ Happy, happy turkey day ~

1050
00:58:18.025 --> 00:58:20.427
~ Let's all eat
the Indian way ~

1051
00:58:20.496 --> 00:58:22.488
~ As Bastille
and Cape Cod day ~

1052
00:58:22.566 --> 00:58:25.765
~ On happy turkey day ~~

1053
00:58:25.838 --> 00:58:30.869
Look at you.
Oh, Amanda, you look perfect!

1054
00:58:30.946 --> 00:58:34.281
You're just the prettiest pilgrim
I've ever seen!

1055
00:58:34.351 --> 00:58:36.912
Gar, come and take
a look at this.

1056
00:58:36.988 --> 00:58:38.479
Here they are!

1057
00:58:38.557 --> 00:58:40.025
They were
by the phone.

1058
00:58:40.093 --> 00:58:41.584
We were calling the FBI.

1059
00:58:41.662 --> 00:58:43.153
Their uncle's in trouble.

1060
00:58:43.232 --> 00:58:45.360
You're late for your fittings.

1061
00:58:45.435 --> 00:58:47.667
I don't want to be
in the pageant.

1062
00:58:47.739 --> 00:58:50.368
You won't help me
realize my vision?

1063
00:58:50.443 --> 00:58:53.005
Your work is puerile
and under-dramatized.

1064
00:58:53.081 --> 00:58:55.880
You lack any sense
of structure, character,

1065
00:58:55.951 --> 00:58:57.783
or the Aristotelian unities.

1066
00:58:57.854 --> 00:59:00.416
Young lady,
I am getting just a tad tired

1067
00:59:00.492 --> 00:59:02.256
of your attitude problem.

1068
00:59:02.328 --> 00:59:04.456
Everyone, campers!

1069
00:59:04.531 --> 00:59:07.195
I have a wonderful idea.

1070
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:10.435
Wednesday and Pugsley
and young Mr. Glicker here,

1071
00:59:10.508 --> 00:59:13.638
well, they have just
never quite latched on

1072
00:59:13.713 --> 00:59:14.941
to the Chippewa spirit,

1073
00:59:15.015 --> 00:59:17.542
nor have some oftheir
little comrades.

1074
00:59:17.619 --> 00:59:20.351
Isn't that sad?

1075
00:59:20.424 --> 00:59:21.395
- Yes!
- Yes!

1076
00:59:21.425 --> 00:59:22.893
Don't we just
hate that?

1077
00:59:22.961 --> 00:59:23.933
- Yes!
- Yes!

1078
00:59:23.963 --> 00:59:25.829
Don't we wish
they'd just die?

1079
00:59:25.899 --> 00:59:26.899
- Yes!
- Yes!

1080
00:59:26.967 --> 00:59:28.196
We don't.

1081
00:59:28.269 --> 00:59:31.331
But you know what
we'll do with them?

1082
00:59:31.408 --> 00:59:33.775
We're going to make
an example.

1083
00:59:33.844 --> 00:59:36.508
We are going to show
that anyone,

1084
00:59:36.582 --> 00:59:39.644
no matter how odd
or pale or chubby,

1085
00:59:39.721 --> 00:59:42.783
can still have
a darn good time.

1086
00:59:42.859 --> 00:59:44.885
Whether they
like it or not.

1087
00:59:44.963 --> 00:59:47.728
What are you going to do?

1088
00:59:48.902 --> 00:59:50.996
Yes, indeedy,
just the ticket.

1089
00:59:51.072 --> 00:59:52.233
Bambi.

1090
00:59:52.307 --> 00:59:54.503
Lassie Come Home.

1091
00:59:54.577 --> 00:59:56.547
The Little Mermaid.

1092
00:59:56.614 --> 00:59:57.614
Stop it.

1093
00:59:57.649 --> 00:59:59.743
He's only a child.

1094
01:00:01.521 --> 01:00:04.788
Don't worry.
We're getting out of here.

1095
01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:06.989
But...

1096
01:00:07.064 --> 01:00:08.760
it's Disney.

1097
01:00:08.834 --> 01:00:10.233
Yes.

1098
01:00:13.474 --> 01:00:16.445
~ The hillsare alive ~

1099
01:00:16.512 --> 01:00:21.145
~ With the sound of music ~

1100
01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:23.621
~ With songs they have sung ~

1101
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:25.488
~ For a thousand years... ~~

1102
01:00:25.559 --> 01:00:29.828
~ And they knew that it was
much more than a hunch ~

1103
01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:33.303
~ That this group must
somehow form a family ~

1104
01:00:33.372 --> 01:00:36.866
~ That's the way we all
became the BradyBunch... ~~

1105
01:00:36.944 --> 01:00:41.042
~ You're always a day ~

1106
01:00:41.117 --> 01:00:46.559
~ A-way ~~

1107
01:00:58.813 --> 01:01:00.007
Well...

1108
01:01:00.081 --> 01:01:02.278
good evening.

1109
01:01:02.351 --> 01:01:04.718
Is there anything
you'd like to say to everyone?

1110
01:01:04.788 --> 01:01:06.017
Yes.

1111
01:01:06.091 --> 01:01:09.153
And just what
might that be?

1112
01:01:12.968 --> 01:01:14.800
I'm not perky.

1113
01:01:15.906 --> 01:01:17.396
That's for damn sure.

1114
01:01:17.476 --> 01:01:19.570
But I want to be.

1115
01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.109
You do?

1116
01:01:22.182 --> 01:01:24.014
I want to smile

1117
01:01:24.085 --> 01:01:26.988
and sing and dance

1118
01:01:27.057 --> 01:01:29.526
and be Pocahontas
in Gary's vision.

1119
01:01:29.595 --> 01:01:32.827
Oh, darling,
do you really mean it?

1120
01:01:51.629 --> 01:01:53.325
Isn't she pretty?

1121
01:01:53.398 --> 01:01:55.094
She's scaring me!

1122
01:01:55.168 --> 01:01:56.227
Oh, Gar.

1123
01:01:56.303 --> 01:01:57.303
Yeah.

1124
01:01:59.642 --> 01:02:01.838
Aah!

1125
01:02:01.912 --> 01:02:03.312
Stay back!

1126
01:02:03.381 --> 01:02:06.011
He's very sick.

1127
01:02:10.927 --> 01:02:12.691
My baby!

1128
01:02:17.036 --> 01:02:19.335
Lumbar, dison...

1129
01:02:19.406 --> 01:02:21.239
pox and thither,

1130
01:02:21.310 --> 01:02:23.472
curad, brattle,

1131
01:02:23.546 --> 01:02:26.608
bone and brine!

1132
01:02:28.688 --> 01:02:31.089
Bone and brine!

1133
01:02:33.295 --> 01:02:34.853
Well, he's stubborn.

1134
01:02:34.930 --> 01:02:36.923
It works on cats.

1135
01:02:37.001 --> 01:02:39.095
- What are we going to do?
- Is it hopeless?

1136
01:02:41.541 --> 01:02:43.373
Here it is.

1137
01:02:43.444 --> 01:02:46.040
"Chapter 18.
Infant possessions."

1138
01:02:46.115 --> 01:02:47.174
He's possessed?

1139
01:02:47.251 --> 01:02:48.650
"Warning signs...

1140
01:02:48.719 --> 01:02:52.556
"severe alterations
in appearance and personality.

1141
01:02:52.626 --> 01:02:55.357
Such alterations
can become permanent."

1142
01:02:55.429 --> 01:02:58.332
Permanent?
Those golden curls?

1143
01:02:58.401 --> 01:02:59.835
Those rosy cheeks?

1144
01:02:59.903 --> 01:03:00.875
That smile?

1145
01:03:00.905 --> 01:03:02.497
"These terrifying changes

1146
01:03:02.575 --> 01:03:06.980
"are most often the result
of a troubled family life.

1147
01:03:07.048 --> 01:03:08.048
Separations..."

1148
01:03:08.117 --> 01:03:09.175
You mean...

1149
01:03:09.251 --> 01:03:10.251
Fester!

1150
01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.811
Bingo! This kid knows

1151
01:03:11.889 --> 01:03:14.917
that something is not
right around here.

1152
01:03:14.994 --> 01:03:17.987
Unless Fester comes back,
we're talking dimples.

1153
01:03:18.066 --> 01:03:19.898
Not in this house.

1154
01:03:19.969 --> 01:03:23.737
He could stay this way
for years. Forever.

1155
01:03:23.808 --> 01:03:26.779
He could become...

1156
01:03:26.846 --> 01:03:27.938
a lawyer...

1157
01:03:28.014 --> 01:03:29.414
I won't listen!

1158
01:03:29.483 --> 01:03:31.315
An orthodontist...

1159
01:03:31.386 --> 01:03:32.752
Mama, stop!

1160
01:03:34.425 --> 01:03:35.654
President.

1161
01:03:38.164 --> 01:03:41.966
Please! I beg you!

1162
01:03:42.036 --> 01:03:43.629
Take me!

1163
01:03:47.901 --> 01:03:50.029
Each summer we take
this occasion

1164
01:03:50.104 --> 01:03:53.166
to celebrate a seminal event
in American history.

1165
01:03:53.242 --> 01:03:55.677
This year, we depict

1166
01:03:55.746 --> 01:03:59.446
perhaps the most important day
in our shared past...

1167
01:03:59.519 --> 01:04:01.351
the first Thanksgiving!

1168
01:04:01.422 --> 01:04:02.913
A day for maize,

1169
01:04:02.991 --> 01:04:05.517
the Native American
word for corn,

1170
01:04:05.595 --> 01:04:07.461
a terrific turkey dinner,

1171
01:04:07.531 --> 01:04:10.525
and brotherhood!

1172
01:04:10.603 --> 01:04:14.564
So, white meat
and dark meat,

1173
01:04:14.642 --> 01:04:17.545
take it away!

1174
01:04:36.444 --> 01:04:40.542
~ Eat us, hey,
it's Thanksgiving day ~

1175
01:04:40.617 --> 01:04:43.850
~ Eat us,
we make a nice buffet ~

1176
01:04:43.922 --> 01:04:47.656
~ We lost the race
with Farmer Ed ~

1177
01:04:47.729 --> 01:04:50.927
~ Eat us 'cause
we're good and dead ~

1178
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.468
~ White man or red man ~

1179
01:04:52.536 --> 01:04:54.529
~ From East, North,
or South ~

1180
01:04:54.606 --> 01:04:56.164
~ Chop off our legs ~

1181
01:04:56.242 --> 01:04:58.643
~ And put 'em
in your mouth ~

1182
01:04:58.712 --> 01:05:00.203
~ Eat me ~

1183
01:05:00.282 --> 01:05:01.773
~ Sauteed or barbecued ~

1184
01:05:01.851 --> 01:05:03.615
~ Eat me ~

1185
01:05:03.687 --> 01:05:05.986
~ We once were pets,
but now we're food ~

1186
01:05:06.057 --> 01:05:09.586
~ We won't stay fresh
for very long ~

1187
01:05:09.663 --> 01:05:12.600
~ So eat us before
we finish this song ~

1188
01:05:12.668 --> 01:05:16.800
~ Eat us before
we finish this song ~~

1189
01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.255
Thank you.

1190
01:05:26.323 --> 01:05:28.792
It was a senseless tragedy.

1191
01:05:34.101 --> 01:05:35.194
Ha ha!

1192
01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:58.063
Angel, I'm going out
for just a minute.

1193
01:05:58.139 --> 01:06:00.871
I forgot the champagne.

1194
01:06:00.944 --> 01:06:04.746
Our three-week anniversary!
I'll go.

1195
01:06:04.816 --> 01:06:07.878
No, no.
You're working hard enough.

1196
01:06:07.955 --> 01:06:11.791
I'll just put your present
on the table.

1197
01:06:11.861 --> 01:06:13.854
Don't peek!

1198
01:06:13.932 --> 01:06:17.461
Oh, please, please!

1199
01:06:17.537 --> 01:06:19.403
What is it?

1200
01:06:19.473 --> 01:06:21.135
Is it string?

1201
01:06:21.209 --> 01:06:22.700
You never know.

1202
01:06:22.779 --> 01:06:25.806
Uh...
is it a dog toy?

1203
01:06:25.884 --> 01:06:27.819
Just you wait.

1204
01:06:30.257 --> 01:06:32.089
It's a bomb.

1205
01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:33.160
What?

1206
01:06:33.195 --> 01:06:36.928
I know.
Wait for my birthday.

1207
01:06:37.001 --> 01:06:38.469
Fester...

1208
01:06:38.537 --> 01:06:40.904
let me look at you.

1209
01:06:40.974 --> 01:06:46.472
I want to remember you
just this way.

1210
01:06:46.550 --> 01:06:48.212
What do you mean?

1211
01:06:48.286 --> 01:06:50.812
Rich. Will you miss me?

1212
01:06:50.889 --> 01:06:53.860
But you'll be right back,
won't you?

1213
01:06:53.928 --> 01:06:55.988
Of course.

1214
01:06:58.134 --> 01:06:59.762
Whoo!

1215
01:06:59.837 --> 01:07:03.970
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

1216
01:07:04.044 --> 01:07:07.675
I am so glad we invited
the Chippewas

1217
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:10.549
to join us
for this holiday meal.

1218
01:07:10.621 --> 01:07:14.081
Remember, these savages
are our guests.

1219
01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.686
We must not be surprised

1220
01:07:16.764 --> 01:07:19.029
at any of their
strange customs.

1221
01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:22.299
After all, they have not
had our advantages,

1222
01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:25.434
such as fine schools,

1223
01:07:25.511 --> 01:07:27.343
libraries full of books,

1224
01:07:27.414 --> 01:07:29.212
shampoo.

1225
01:07:31.053 --> 01:07:34.252
How. I am Pocahontas,
a Chippewa maiden.

1226
01:07:34.324 --> 01:07:35.553
An Indian.

1227
01:07:35.627 --> 01:07:36.788
Enough said.

1228
01:07:36.862 --> 01:07:39.229
And I am Running Bear,

1229
01:07:39.299 --> 01:07:41.097
betrothed to Pocahontas.

1230
01:07:41.169 --> 01:07:43.001
In the play.

1231
01:07:43.072 --> 01:07:45.565
20 grand for summer camp,

1232
01:07:45.643 --> 01:07:46.975
he's Mr. Woo-Woo.

1233
01:07:47.045 --> 01:07:51.177
We have brought a special gift
for this holiday feast.

1234
01:07:56.893 --> 01:07:59.455
I am a turkey. Kill me.

1235
01:07:59.531 --> 01:08:03.299
What a thoughtful gift!

1236
01:08:06.008 --> 01:08:09.035
Why, you are
as civilized as we,

1237
01:08:09.113 --> 01:08:12.711
except we wear shoes
and have last names.

1238
01:08:12.786 --> 01:08:16.018
Welcome to our table,
our new primitive friends.

1239
01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:17.752
Thank you,
Sarah Miller.

1240
01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:20.388
You're the most beautiful person
I've ever seen.

1241
01:08:20.464 --> 01:08:22.991
Your hair is the color
of the sun,

1242
01:08:23.069 --> 01:08:25.095
your skin is like fresh milk,

1243
01:08:25.172 --> 01:08:27.004
and everyone loves you.

1244
01:08:27.075 --> 01:08:29.408
Stop! Sit.

1245
01:08:29.478 --> 01:08:31.106
Wait.

1246
01:08:31.181 --> 01:08:32.153
What?

1247
01:08:32.183 --> 01:08:34.948
We cannot break
bread with you.

1248
01:08:35.021 --> 01:08:37.820
Huh? Becky,
what's going on?

1249
01:08:37.892 --> 01:08:39.155
Wednesday!

1250
01:08:39.227 --> 01:08:40.991
You have taken the land

1251
01:08:41.063 --> 01:08:43.966
which is
rightfully ours.

1252
01:08:44.035 --> 01:08:46.561
Years from now,
my people will be forced

1253
01:08:46.639 --> 01:08:49.303
to live in mobile homes
on reservations.

1254
01:08:49.377 --> 01:08:51.608
Your people
will wear cardigans

1255
01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:53.410
and drink highballs.

1256
01:08:53.483 --> 01:08:56.045
We will sell our bracelets
by the roadsides.

1257
01:08:56.121 --> 01:08:57.453
You will play golf

1258
01:08:57.523 --> 01:08:59.458
and enjoy
hot hors d'oeuvres.

1259
01:08:59.526 --> 01:09:02.462
My people will have pain
and degradation.

1260
01:09:02.530 --> 01:09:05.592
Your people
will have stick shifts.

1261
01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:08.071
The gods of my tribe
have spoken.

1262
01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:10.939
They have said,
"Do not trust the pilgrims,

1263
01:09:11.010 --> 01:09:12.876
especially Sarah Miller."

1264
01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:15.315
Gary, she's changing the words.

1265
01:09:15.384 --> 01:09:17.649
And for all these reasons,

1266
01:09:17.721 --> 01:09:20.749
I have decided to scalp you

1267
01:09:20.826 --> 01:09:23.319
and burn your village
to the ground.

1268
01:09:30.442 --> 01:09:32.536
Aah!

1269
01:09:33.647 --> 01:09:34.647
Children! Campers!

1270
01:09:34.715 --> 01:09:36.707
Stop!
You're destroying my text!

1271
01:09:43.562 --> 01:09:45.394
Aah! Aah!

1272
01:09:45.465 --> 01:09:47.901
He's not a team player.

1273
01:09:47.969 --> 01:09:49.061
He needs friends.

1274
01:09:49.138 --> 01:09:52.074
He needs friends like this?

1275
01:09:52.142 --> 01:09:53.440
- Aah!
- Oh!

1276
01:10:07.099 --> 01:10:09.125
Aah!

1277
01:10:17.683 --> 01:10:19.982
Uh, I beg your pardon.

1278
01:10:23.124 --> 01:10:25.150
Do something!

1279
01:11:13.872 --> 01:11:15.898
~ Macho, macho man ~

1280
01:11:15.975 --> 01:11:17.807
~ Feel my muscles ~

1281
01:11:17.878 --> 01:11:20.872
~ I've got to be a macho man ~

1282
01:11:20.949 --> 01:11:24.580
~ Mucho, mucho, macho, macho ~

1283
01:11:24.655 --> 01:11:26.521
~ I got to be a macho ~

1284
01:11:26.591 --> 01:11:28.890
~ Hey, hey, hey, hey ~

1285
01:11:28.961 --> 01:11:32.091
Hey! Wait!
What time is it, Jorge?

1286
01:11:32.167 --> 01:11:33.601
Ah, 6:25.

1287
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:35.661
Oops. Got to go.

1288
01:11:35.739 --> 01:11:37.766
- No!
- Wait!

1289
01:11:37.843 --> 01:11:40.506
Wait here.
It's my anniversary.

1290
01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:41.878
I'll be right back.

1291
01:11:41.949 --> 01:11:44.248
Your husband
is a very lucky man.

1292
01:11:44.319 --> 01:11:46.482
Don't say that!

1293
01:11:46.557 --> 01:11:48.116
~ Hey, hey, hey ~

1294
01:11:48.193 --> 01:11:51.790
~ Hey, macho, macho man ~

1295
01:11:51.865 --> 01:11:55.030
~ I got to be a macho man ~~

1296
01:11:59.176 --> 01:12:01.008
Cheers.

1297
01:12:01.079 --> 01:12:03.014
Oh, no, no.

1298
01:12:16.937 --> 01:12:19.840
But, Officer...

1299
01:12:19.909 --> 01:12:23.039
my husband
was in that house.

1300
01:12:41.075 --> 01:12:45.139
Happy anniversary, Debbie.

1301
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:26.712
Help. Help.

1302
01:13:38.433 --> 01:13:41.996
Sweetheart!
Did you get the champagne?

1303
01:13:42.072 --> 01:13:43.232
Freeze!

1304
01:13:45.544 --> 01:13:47.206
Pookie?

1305
01:13:47.281 --> 01:13:50.183
I tried to make it
look like an accident.

1306
01:13:50.252 --> 01:13:52.414
I tried to give you some dignity,
but, oh, no, not you.

1307
01:13:52.489 --> 01:13:54.651
What are you saying?

1308
01:13:54.725 --> 01:13:58.094
I want you dead,
and I want your money.

1309
01:13:58.164 --> 01:14:00.828
But... But...
don't you love me?

1310
01:14:04.841 --> 01:14:06.673
Is that a no?

1311
01:14:06.744 --> 01:14:09.510
Oh, do I love you.
Look at yourself!

1312
01:14:09.582 --> 01:14:12.143
You're a nightmare.
You're the missing link.

1313
01:14:12.219 --> 01:14:14.689
You shouldn't be married.
You should be studied.

1314
01:14:14.757 --> 01:14:17.283
You're a big,
dumb, weird thing.

1315
01:14:17.361 --> 01:14:20.594
No woman in her right mind
could love you.

1316
01:14:20.666 --> 01:14:21.666
Yeow!

1317
01:14:21.735 --> 01:14:23.670
Thing!

1318
01:14:34.788 --> 01:14:38.351
I'll get you!
And your little hand, too!

1319
01:14:42.534 --> 01:14:44.526
Aah!

1320
01:15:12.581 --> 01:15:13.879
Come on.

1321
01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:17.012
No. I have to go back.
For the others.

1322
01:15:17.089 --> 01:15:18.250
You're very brave.

1323
01:15:18.324 --> 01:15:21.453
And to watch the place burn.
You go.

1324
01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:23.122
Save your uncle.

1325
01:15:23.198 --> 01:15:25.395
I may never
see you again.

1326
01:15:25.469 --> 01:15:26.595
I know.

1327
01:15:26.670 --> 01:15:28.503
There are forces
tearing us apart...

1328
01:15:28.574 --> 01:15:32.012
Gary, Debbie,
seventh grade.

1329
01:15:34.883 --> 01:15:36.408
I'll never forget you.

1330
01:15:36.486 --> 01:15:37.681
You won't?

1331
01:15:37.755 --> 01:15:39.656
You're too weird.

1332
01:15:39.724 --> 01:15:42.718
We'll always have today
and Chippewa.

1333
01:15:42.796 --> 01:15:44.162
And this.

1334
01:15:46.402 --> 01:15:48.371
What is it?

1335
01:15:48.438 --> 01:15:49.929
Amanda's retainer.

1336
01:15:51.276 --> 01:15:52.504
Cara mia.

1337
01:15:52.579 --> 01:15:54.275
Mon cher.

1338
01:16:02.995 --> 01:16:04.121
Come on!

1339
01:16:21.257 --> 01:16:22.589
Move it!

1340
01:16:25.297 --> 01:16:26.594
Move out of the way!

1341
01:16:33.242 --> 01:16:35.302
"We looked,

1342
01:16:35.379 --> 01:16:39.148
"then we saw him
step in on the mat.

1343
01:16:39.219 --> 01:16:42.520
"We looked,
and we saw him...

1344
01:16:42.591 --> 01:16:45.857
the cat in the hat."

1345
01:16:45.929 --> 01:16:48.058
Are you enjoying this?

1346
01:16:49.402 --> 01:16:52.304
To think...

1347
01:16:52.372 --> 01:16:54.204
a child of mine.

1348
01:16:56.011 --> 01:16:58.106
"I know it is wet,

1349
01:16:58.182 --> 01:17:00.845
"and the sun is not sunny,

1350
01:17:00.919 --> 01:17:04.220
"but we can have
lots of good fun,

1351
01:17:04.291 --> 01:17:05.816
that is funny."

1352
01:17:12.972 --> 01:17:15.374
Oh, no.

1353
01:17:15.443 --> 01:17:17.241
He lives.

1354
01:17:17.312 --> 01:17:19.907
Come on! It's Gomez!

1355
01:17:21.118 --> 01:17:24.419
~ Swing low ~

1356
01:17:24.490 --> 01:17:27.893
~ Sweet chariot ~

1357
01:17:27.962 --> 01:17:33.460
~ Coming for
to carry me home ~

1358
01:17:33.537 --> 01:17:36.099
~ Swing low ~~

1359
01:17:36.175 --> 01:17:38.804
My baby is ill,

1360
01:17:38.879 --> 01:17:41.041
and my husband
is dying.

1361
01:17:42.351 --> 01:17:45.481
Oh, mama,
what shall I do?

1362
01:17:45.556 --> 01:17:48.391
Well, you have
a black dress.

1363
01:17:59.845 --> 01:18:00.845
Gomez!

1364
01:18:00.914 --> 01:18:02.143
- Fester!
- Fester!

1365
01:18:02.216 --> 01:18:04.048
Fester? Where is Fester?

1366
01:18:04.119 --> 01:18:05.610
He's right here,
mon cher.

1367
01:18:05.689 --> 01:18:08.922
It's me, Gomez.

1368
01:18:08.994 --> 01:18:11.964
I've tried to be
someone I'm not.

1369
01:18:12.031 --> 01:18:14.126
I live in shame...

1370
01:18:14.202 --> 01:18:15.932
and the suburbs!

1371
01:18:16.005 --> 01:18:18.031
But you belong to Debbie.

1372
01:18:18.108 --> 01:18:20.772
You're Debbie's love toy.

1373
01:18:20.846 --> 01:18:25.547
You are Mr. Debbie!

1374
01:18:25.619 --> 01:18:27.520
I am an Addams!

1375
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:29.286
Fester!

1376
01:18:33.032 --> 01:18:34.466
Uncle Fester!

1377
01:18:34.534 --> 01:18:36.230
Children!

1378
01:18:39.776 --> 01:18:41.540
You sent us to camp.

1379
01:18:43.013 --> 01:18:44.413
They made us sing.

1380
01:18:51.928 --> 01:18:53.863
My own dear family.

1381
01:18:57.737 --> 01:19:00.172
How I've missed you all.

1382
01:19:00.241 --> 01:19:04.874
Our whole family...
together at last.

1383
01:19:04.948 --> 01:19:06.917
Three generations...

1384
01:19:06.985 --> 01:19:08.647
above ground.

1385
01:19:08.721 --> 01:19:10.030
In-laws!

1386
01:19:16.907 --> 01:19:19.275
I don't want
to hurt anybody.

1387
01:19:19.345 --> 01:19:21.814
I don't enjoy
hurting anybody.

1388
01:19:21.882 --> 01:19:26.082
I don't like guns or bombs
or electric chairs,

1389
01:19:26.156 --> 01:19:28.387
but sometimes
people just won't listen,

1390
01:19:28.459 --> 01:19:31.224
and so I have to use
persuasion...

1391
01:19:31.298 --> 01:19:33.062
and slides.

1392
01:19:33.134 --> 01:19:35.968
My parents...
Sharon and Dave.

1393
01:19:36.038 --> 01:19:37.631
Generous, doting...

1394
01:19:37.707 --> 01:19:39.505
or were they?

1395
01:19:39.576 --> 01:19:44.016
All I ever wanted
was a ballerina Barbie

1396
01:19:44.084 --> 01:19:46.178
in her pretty pink tutu.

1397
01:19:46.254 --> 01:19:47.654
My birthday.

1398
01:19:47.723 --> 01:19:49.123
I was 10,

1399
01:19:49.192 --> 01:19:52.095
and do you know
what they got me?

1400
01:19:52.164 --> 01:19:55.533
Malibu Barbie.

1401
01:19:55.602 --> 01:19:57.298
Malibu Barbie.

1402
01:19:57.372 --> 01:19:58.498
The nightmare.

1403
01:19:58.573 --> 01:19:59.734
The nerve.

1404
01:19:59.809 --> 01:20:02.176
That's not
what I wanted.

1405
01:20:02.245 --> 01:20:04.272
That's not who I was.

1406
01:20:04.350 --> 01:20:06.819
I was a ballerina...

1407
01:20:06.886 --> 01:20:10.153
graceful, delicate.

1408
01:20:10.225 --> 01:20:12.023
They had to go.

1409
01:20:28.019 --> 01:20:31.218
My first husband,
the heart surgeon.

1410
01:20:31.291 --> 01:20:34.262
All day long,
coronaries, transplants.

1411
01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:35.958
What about your needs?

1412
01:20:36.032 --> 01:20:38.628
"Sorry about dinner, Deb.

1413
01:20:38.704 --> 01:20:40.400
The pope has a cold."

1414
01:20:42.610 --> 01:20:43.942
An axe.

1415
01:20:44.012 --> 01:20:46.311
That takes me back.

1416
01:21:03.576 --> 01:21:06.172
Husband number two...
the senator.

1417
01:21:06.247 --> 01:21:09.149
He loved his state.
He loved his country.

1418
01:21:09.218 --> 01:21:11.211
What about Debbie?

1419
01:21:11.289 --> 01:21:14.487
"Sorry, Debbie.
No Mercedes this year.

1420
01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:16.723
We have to set an example."

1421
01:21:16.797 --> 01:21:20.326
Oh, yeah? Set this!

1422
01:21:37.230 --> 01:21:39.028
My latest husband.

1423
01:21:39.099 --> 01:21:42.628
My late husband Fester.

1424
01:21:42.705 --> 01:21:44.173
The fool.

1425
01:21:44.241 --> 01:21:46.142
The corpse.

1426
01:21:46.210 --> 01:21:48.941
And his adorable family.

1427
01:21:49.014 --> 01:21:52.383
You took me in.
You accepted me.

1428
01:21:52.453 --> 01:21:55.947
But did any of you love me?

1429
01:21:56.026 --> 01:21:57.357
Really love me?

1430
01:21:57.427 --> 01:21:59.225
Hands.

1431
01:22:14.021 --> 01:22:15.853
So I... I killed.

1432
01:22:15.924 --> 01:22:17.722
So I maimed.

1433
01:22:17.793 --> 01:22:23.029
So I destroyed one
innocent life after another.

1434
01:22:23.101 --> 01:22:26.595
Aren't I a human being?

1435
01:22:26.674 --> 01:22:32.378
Don't I yearn and...
ache and shop?

1436
01:22:33.585 --> 01:22:38.855
Don't I deserve love...

1437
01:22:40.362 --> 01:22:42.331
and jewelry?

1438
01:23:06.036 --> 01:23:07.664
Adieu, mon cher.

1439
01:23:07.739 --> 01:23:09.537
Adios, cara mia.

1440
01:23:09.608 --> 01:23:13.513
Debbie, let them go.
Take me and my money.

1441
01:23:13.582 --> 01:23:15.710
For what I've done,
I deserve to die.

1442
01:23:15.785 --> 01:23:17.515
Sorry.

1443
01:23:40.490 --> 01:23:42.652
Goodbye, everybody.

1444
01:23:42.727 --> 01:23:44.093
Wish me luck.

1445
01:23:44.163 --> 01:23:45.654
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

1446
01:24:42.255 --> 01:24:45.249
A birthday party!
What a treat!

1447
01:24:45.326 --> 01:24:48.764
And to think I might
have missed all this.

1448
01:24:48.832 --> 01:24:50.801
What was I thinking of?

1449
01:24:50.868 --> 01:24:52.496
Physical pleasure.

1450
01:24:52.571 --> 01:24:53.766
Oh...

1451
01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:56.810
Uncle Fester,
do you miss Debbie?

1452
01:24:56.878 --> 01:25:00.941
Well, sometimes,
late at night.

1453
01:25:01.018 --> 01:25:03.989
I remember
how she'd turn to me

1454
01:25:04.056 --> 01:25:07.892
and say "Jesus, Fester,
go back to your room."

1455
01:25:10.432 --> 01:25:12.732
Yoo-hoo!

1456
01:25:15.106 --> 01:25:16.540
Are we late?

1457
01:25:18.078 --> 01:25:20.981
Not at all.
We'rejust getting started.

1458
01:25:21.050 --> 01:25:23.986
I hope no one minds.
We brought along a guest.

1459
01:25:24.054 --> 01:25:28.050
This is our new nanny...
Dementia.

1460
01:25:30.831 --> 01:25:32.459
Oh...

1461
01:25:32.534 --> 01:25:34.298
Dementia.

1462
01:25:34.370 --> 01:25:36.636
What a beautiful name.

1463
01:25:36.708 --> 01:25:38.700
It means insanity.

1464
01:25:39.745 --> 01:25:44.583
My name's Fester.
It means to rot.

1465
01:25:44.653 --> 01:25:47.021
A toast.

1466
01:25:47.091 --> 01:25:50.152
To the glorious
mysteries of life.

1467
01:25:50.228 --> 01:25:53.997
To all that binds
a family as one.

1468
01:25:54.068 --> 01:25:57.562
To mirth, to merriment,
to manslaughter.

1469
01:25:57.641 --> 01:25:59.473
Hear, hear.

1470
01:25:59.543 --> 01:26:01.011
To dear friends.

1471
01:26:04.785 --> 01:26:07.779
To new friends.

1472
01:26:08.925 --> 01:26:11.054
To youth.

1473
01:26:11.129 --> 01:26:13.064
How do I look?

1474
01:26:13.132 --> 01:26:14.623
Disturbing.

1475
01:26:14.701 --> 01:26:16.795
To passion.

1476
01:26:16.871 --> 01:26:18.305
To paradise.

1477
01:26:18.373 --> 01:26:19.932
To pain.

1478
01:26:20.009 --> 01:26:22.342
Tonight.

1479
01:26:24.215 --> 01:26:28.314
Ha ha! Make way
for the birthday boy!

1480
01:26:31.761 --> 01:26:33.662
Thing, will you
do the honors?

1481
01:26:45.850 --> 01:26:49.253
Your family
is really interesting.

1482
01:26:49.322 --> 01:26:52.623
Your parents are so
involved with each other.

1483
01:26:55.465 --> 01:26:58.766
Wednesday, do you think,
like, maybe someday

1484
01:26:58.837 --> 01:27:02.570
you might want to get
married and have kids?

1485
01:27:02.643 --> 01:27:03.643
No.

1486
01:27:05.014 --> 01:27:08.679
But what if you met
just the right man

1487
01:27:08.753 --> 01:27:10.779
who worshipped
and adored you,

1488
01:27:10.856 --> 01:27:12.518
who'd do anything
for you,

1489
01:27:12.592 --> 01:27:14.185
who'd be
your devoted slave?

1490
01:27:14.261 --> 01:27:15.752
What would you do?

1491
01:27:17.133 --> 01:27:18.465
I'd pity him.

1492
01:27:27.582 --> 01:27:30.051
Poor Debbie.
She was sick.

1493
01:27:30.119 --> 01:27:32.248
She wasn't sick.

1494
01:27:32.323 --> 01:27:33.757
She was sloppy.

1495
01:27:33.826 --> 01:27:36.125
What do you mean?

1496
01:27:36.196 --> 01:27:41.466
If I wanted to kill my husband,
I'd do it, and I wouldn't get caught.

1497
01:27:41.538 --> 01:27:42.767
How?

1498
01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:45.605
I'd scare him to death.

1499
01:27:46.646 --> 01:27:49.344
No, you wouldn't.

1500
01:27:49.417 --> 01:27:51.852
We're all very sorry, Debbie.

1501
01:27:51.921 --> 01:27:54.892
We wish you only the best.

1502
01:27:56.395 --> 01:28:01.563
Aah! Aah!

1503
01:28:01.636 --> 01:28:03.161
Aah!

1504
01:28:08.904 --> 01:28:11.100

1529
01:28:56.011 --> 01:28:57.912
~ They're creepy, kooky,
mysterious, spooky ~

1530
01:28:57.981 --> 01:28:59.609
~ As loony as can be
when you see the movie ~

1531
01:28:59.684 --> 01:29:01.711

the madness won't stop ~

01:29:38.078 --> 01:29:40.047
~ Nanny's got a plot
to get the family money ~

1553
01:29:40.115 --> 01:29:41.606
~ Makes Fester
fall for her ~

1554

1555
01:29:43.553 --> 01:29:45.044
~ The family
comes to Fester's aid ~

1556
01:29:45.123 --> 01:29:47.092
~ The plot is foiled,
no one gets paid ~

1557
01:29:47.159 --> 01:29:49.094

runnin' things ~

01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:10.852

just strange ~

1570
01:30:10.930 --> 01:30:12.455
~ Some say loco,
insane to the brain ~

1571
01:30:12.533 --> 01:30:13.933
~ But you know
that you love 'em ~

1572
01:30:14.002 --> 01:30:15.002
~ In a class
by theirselves ~

1573
01:30:15.070 --> 01:30:16.231
~ None below,
none above 'em ~

1574
01:30:16.305 --> 01:30:18.069
~ It ain't nothing
to be ashamed of~

1575
01:30:18.141 --> 01:30:19.871

like Cube and get with it ~

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:39.833
~ Props to the number one
family of horror ~

1587
01:30:39.909 --> 01:30:41.775
~ This song's for the movie
and the dance floor ~

1588
01:30:41.846 --> 01:30:43.371
~ Tag team
always delivers the funk ~

1589
01:30:43.448 --> 01:30:45.349

with the bump for the trunk ~

1590
01:30:45.418 --> 01:30:47.250
