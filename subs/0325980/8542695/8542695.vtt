5
00:00:56.296 --> 00:00:58.672
Cursed pirates sail these waters.

6
00:00:58.756 --> 00:01:01.007
You don't want to bring
them down on us, do ya?

7
00:01:01.092 --> 00:01:02.885
Mr. Gibbs, that will do.

8
00:01:03.678 --> 00:01:05.555
She was singing about pirates!

9
00:01:05.597 --> 00:01:07.722
Bad luck to be singing about pirates

10
00:01:07.807 --> 00:01:10.977
with us mired in this unnatural fog,
mark my words.

11
00:01:11.061 --> 00:01:12.395
Consider them marked.

12
00:01:14.148 --> 00:01:16.565
- On your way.
- Aye, lieutenant.

13
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.734
It's bad luck to have
a woman on board too.

14
00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:21.027
Even a miniature one.

15
00:01:22.154 --> 00:01:24.614
I think it'd be rather exciting
to meet a pirate.

16
00:01:26.326 --> 00:01:28.411
Think again, Miss Swann.

17
00:01:28.495 --> 00:01:31.330
Vile and dissolute creatures,
the lot of 'em.

18
00:01:31.414 --> 00:01:34.542
I intend to see to it that any man
who sails under a pirate flag

19
00:01:34.584 --> 00:01:37.210
or wears a pirate brand
gets what he deserves.

20
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.590
A short drop and a sudden stop.

21
00:01:44.635 --> 00:01:47.262
Lieutenant Norrington,
I appreciate your fervor,

22
00:01:47.305 --> 00:01:51.934
but I'm concerned about the effect
this subject will have upon my daughter.

23
00:01:52.018 --> 00:01:53.810
My apologies, Governor Swann.

24
00:01:53.895 --> 00:01:56.105
Actually, I find it all fascinating.

25
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.938
Yes. That's what concerns me.

26
00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.637
Look! A boy!
There's a boy in the water!

27
00:02:31.098 --> 00:02:33.058
Man overboard!

28
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.019
Man the ropes!
Fetch a hook!

29
00:02:36.854 --> 00:02:38.188
Haul him aboard!

30
00:02:46.738 --> 00:02:48.657
He's still breathing.

31
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.992
Mary, Mother of God!

32
00:02:57.458 --> 00:02:59.001
What happened here?

33
00:03:00.502 --> 00:03:04.213
Most likely the powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

34
00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:07.840
Lot of good it did them.

35
00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:10.512
Everyone's thinking it,
I'm just saying it.

36
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.597
Pirates!

37
00:03:12.682 --> 00:03:15.517
There's no proof of that!

38
00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:17.100
It was probably an accident.

39
00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:20.479
Rouse the captain.

40
00:03:20.522 --> 00:03:22.439
- Aye, sir.
- Heave to and take in sail.

41
00:03:22.524 --> 00:03:24.191
- Launch the boats.
- Heave to!

42
00:03:26.362 --> 00:03:28.697
Elizabeth, I want you
to accompany the boy.

43
00:03:29.864 --> 00:03:31.199
He'll be in your charge.

44
00:03:31.242 --> 00:03:32.909
Take care of him.

45
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.887
It's OK.

46
00:03:53.972 --> 00:03:56.724
My name's Elizabeth Swann.

47
00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:59.477
Will Turner.

48
00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:02.397
I'm watching over you, Will.

49
00:04:15.202 --> 00:04:17.161
You're a pirate!

50
00:04:17.245 --> 00:04:19.164
Has he said anything?

51
00:04:19.248 --> 00:04:20.832
His name's William Turner.

52
00:04:20.916 --> 00:04:22.416
That's all I found out.

53
00:04:23.418 --> 00:04:25.628
Take him below.

54
00:05:35.031 --> 00:05:36.824
Elizabeth!

55
00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:39.827
Are you all right?

56
00:05:41.247 --> 00:05:42.371
Are you decent?

57
00:05:42.998 --> 00:05:43.998
Yes.

58
00:05:44.041 --> 00:05:45.040
Yes?

59
00:05:46.543 --> 00:05:48.002
Still in bed at this hour?

60
00:05:50.046 --> 00:05:52.339
It's a beautiful day.

61
00:05:53.841 --> 00:05:55.427
I have a gift for you.

62
00:05:58.388 --> 00:06:01.347
- Oh, it's beautiful!
- Isn't it?

63
00:06:03.018 --> 00:06:05.437
May I inquire as to the occasion?

64
00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:08.938
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

65
00:06:09.022 --> 00:06:11.066
Go on.

66
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.029
Actually, I...

67
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.325
I had hoped you might wear it
for the ceremony today.

68
00:06:20.368 --> 00:06:21.660
Ceremony?

69
00:06:21.703 --> 00:06:24.121
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.

70
00:06:24.205 --> 00:06:25.372
I knew it!

71
00:06:25.457 --> 00:06:28.750
Commodore Norrington,
as he's about to become.

72
00:06:28.835 --> 00:06:30.752
A fine gentleman, don't you think?

73
00:06:31.546 --> 00:06:33.046
He fancies you, you know.

74
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.133
Elizabeth?

75
00:06:35.217 --> 00:06:36.884
How's it coming?

76
00:06:36.968 --> 00:06:39.553
It's difficult to say.

77
00:06:39.637 --> 00:06:41.889
I'm told it's
the latest fashion in London.

78
00:06:41.931 --> 00:06:43.306
Well, women in London

79
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.058
must've learned not to breathe!

80
00:06:47.228 --> 00:06:48.897
My Lord, you have a visitor.

81
00:07:07.207 --> 00:07:08.415
Ah, Mr. Turner.

82
00:07:08.458 --> 00:07:09.917
Good to see you again.

83
00:07:10.001 --> 00:07:11.835
Good day, sir.

84
00:07:12.753 --> 00:07:13.920
I have your order.

85
00:07:19.427 --> 00:07:20.594
Well...

86
00:07:20.678 --> 00:07:22.429
The blade is folded steel.

87
00:07:22.514 --> 00:07:25.515
That's gold filigree
laid into the handle.

88
00:07:26.226 --> 00:07:27.476
If I may?

89
00:07:29.646 --> 00:07:31.103
Perfectly balanced.

90
00:07:31.897 --> 00:07:34.191
The tang is nearly
the full width of the blade.

91
00:07:37.111 --> 00:07:39.279
Impressive. Very impressive.

92
00:07:39.322 --> 00:07:40.656
Very nice.

93
00:07:41.324 --> 00:07:44.325
Commodore Norrington's going
to be very pleased with this.

94
00:07:45.452 --> 00:07:47.955
Do pass my compliments
onto your master.

95
00:07:50.123 --> 00:07:51.123
I shall.

96
00:07:52.584 --> 00:07:55.921
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

97
00:07:57.422 --> 00:08:00.925
Elizabeth!
You look absolutely stunning.

98
00:08:00.968 --> 00:08:02.802
Will.

99
00:08:03.136 --> 00:08:05.972
It's so good to see you.

100
00:08:06.056 --> 00:08:07.723
I had a dream about you last night.

101
00:08:07.808 --> 00:08:08.808
About me?

102
00:08:08.892 --> 00:08:10.561
Is it entirely proper for you...?

103
00:08:10.645 --> 00:08:12.436
About the day we met.
Do you remember?

104
00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:15.314
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

105
00:08:15.357 --> 00:08:17.859
How many times must I ask you
to call me Elizabeth?

106
00:08:17.944 --> 00:08:20.237
At least once more, Miss Swann.

107
00:08:20.321 --> 00:08:22.154
As always.

108
00:08:22.196 --> 00:08:23.490
Now, you see?

109
00:08:23.533 --> 00:08:25.825
At least the boy
has a sense of propriety.

110
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:27.160
We really must be going.

111
00:08:27.203 --> 00:08:28.203
Come on.

112
00:08:29.539 --> 00:08:30.830
Good day, Mr. Turner.

113
00:08:32.415 --> 00:08:33.417
Come along!

114
00:08:36.796 --> 00:08:38.003
Good day...

115
00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:42.342
...Elizabeth.

116
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.725
Hold up there, you!

117
00:10:16.394 --> 00:10:19.729
It's a shilling to tie up
your boat to the dock.

118
00:10:21.732 --> 00:10:23.441
And I shall need to know your name.

119
00:10:26.113 --> 00:10:28.406
What do you say to three shillings,

120
00:10:28.448 --> 00:10:29.699
and we forget the name?

121
00:10:33.161 --> 00:10:35.370
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.

122
00:11:11.825 --> 00:11:13.658
Two paces... march!

123
00:11:16.203 --> 00:11:18.206
Right about... face!

124
00:11:20.751 --> 00:11:23.502
Present... arms!

125
00:11:47.777 --> 00:11:50.529
This dock is off-limits to civilians.

126
00:11:50.614 --> 00:11:52.363
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.

127
00:11:52.406 --> 00:11:55.117
If I see one,
I shall inform you immediately.

128
00:11:58.704 --> 00:12:02.331
Apparently, there's some high-toned
and fancy to-do up at the fort, eh?

129
00:12:02.373 --> 00:12:05.544
How could it be two upstanding
gentlemen, such as yourselves,

130
00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.588
did not merit an invitation?

131
00:12:07.672 --> 00:12:10.841
Someone has to make sure this dock
stays off-limits to civilians.

132
00:12:10.884 --> 00:12:13.261
It's a fine goal, to be sure.

133
00:12:13.344 --> 00:12:15.304
But it seems to me, a...

134
00:12:15.388 --> 00:12:17.138
A ship like that...

135
00:12:17.223 --> 00:12:20.226
...makes this one here
a bit superfluous, really.

136
00:12:20.268 --> 00:12:23.394
Oh, the Dauntless is the power
in these waters, true enough,

137
00:12:23.437 --> 00:12:27.398
but there's no ship that can match
the Interceptor for speed.

138
00:12:27.441 --> 00:12:28.525
I've heard of one.

139
00:12:28.567 --> 00:12:31.236
It's supposed to be very fast,
nigh uncatchable.

140
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.072
The Black Pearl.

141
00:12:35.617 --> 00:12:37.115
There's no real ship

142
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.869
that can match the Interceptor.

143
00:12:40.539 --> 00:12:42.581
The Black Pearl is a real ship.

144
00:12:42.624 --> 00:12:44.249
No. No, it's not.

145
00:12:44.291 --> 00:12:45.625
Yes, it is. I've seen it!

146
00:12:46.376 --> 00:12:47.461
You've seen it?

147
00:12:47.546 --> 00:12:50.422
- Yes.
- You haven't seen it!

148
00:12:50.507 --> 00:12:53.214
- Yes, I have!
- You've seen a ship

149
00:12:53.257 --> 00:12:55.262
with black sails,

150
00:12:55.346 --> 00:12:57.012
that's crewed by the damned,

151
00:12:57.097 --> 00:12:59.597
and captained by a man so evil

152
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.267
that hell itself spat him back out?

153
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.311
No.

154
00:13:06.063 --> 00:13:08.480
But I have seen a ship
with black sails.

155
00:13:08.565 --> 00:13:11.442
Oh... And no ship that's
not crewed by the damned,

156
00:13:11.527 --> 00:13:14.279
and captained by a man so evil
that hell spat him back out

157
00:13:14.321 --> 00:13:15.947
could possibly have black sails,

158
00:13:16.031 --> 00:13:18.283
therefore couldn't possibly
be any other ship

159
00:13:18.325 --> 00:13:21.785
than the Black Pearl,
is that what you're saying?

160
00:13:21.828 --> 00:13:22.954
No.

161
00:13:22.997 --> 00:13:24.288
Like I said,

162
00:13:24.372 --> 00:13:27.584
there's no real ship
that can match the Interceptor...

163
00:13:30.046 --> 00:13:31.044
Hey!

164
00:13:32.508 --> 00:13:33.506
You!

165
00:13:34.008 --> 00:13:35.675
Get away from there!

166
00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:38.135
You don't have permission
to be aboard there!

167
00:13:38.177 --> 00:13:39.889
Sorry. It's such a pretty boat.

168
00:13:39.972 --> 00:13:40.971
Ship!

169
00:13:41.725 --> 00:13:42.724
What's your name?

170
00:13:42.807 --> 00:13:43.807
Smith!

171
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:45.602
Or Smithy, if you like.

172
00:13:45.644 --> 00:13:48.939
What's your purpose in Port Royal,
Mr. Smith?

173
00:13:48.982 --> 00:13:49.981
Yeah, and no lies!

174
00:13:50.065 --> 00:13:51.525
All right then.

175
00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:52.609
I confess.

176
00:13:53.026 --> 00:13:56.321
It is my intention to commandeer
one of these ships, pick up a crew

177
00:13:56.404 --> 00:13:59.823
in Tortuga to rape, pillage, and pilfer
my weasely black guts out.

178
00:13:59.866 --> 00:14:01.783
I said, no lies!

179
00:14:01.826 --> 00:14:03.746
I think he's telling the truth.

180
00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.371
If he were telling the truth,

181
00:14:05.456 --> 00:14:06.707
he wouldn't have told us.

182
00:14:07.666 --> 00:14:11.210
Unless he knew you wouldn't believe
the truth, even if he told it to you.

183
00:14:21.931 --> 00:14:23.306
May I have a moment?

184
00:14:32.274 --> 00:14:34.024
You look lovely, Elizabeth.

185
00:14:34.067 --> 00:14:35.861
Yes.

186
00:14:36.946 --> 00:14:39.614
I apologize if I seem forward,

187
00:14:39.698 --> 00:14:41.784
but I must speak my mind.

188
00:14:44.663 --> 00:14:47.664
This promotion throws into sharp relief

189
00:14:47.706 --> 00:14:50.665
that which I have not yet achieved.

190
00:14:53.127 --> 00:14:54.880
A marriage to a fine woman.

191
00:14:56.423 --> 00:14:59.092
You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.

192
00:14:59.676 --> 00:15:01.052
I can't breathe.

193
00:15:01.136 --> 00:15:02.928
Yes, I...

194
00:15:03.012 --> 00:15:04.514
I'm a bit nervous myself.

195
00:15:07.392 --> 00:15:09.101
And then they made me their chief.

196
00:15:12.064 --> 00:15:13.106
Elizabeth?

197
00:15:15.817 --> 00:15:16.818
Elizabeth!

198
00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:21.780
The rocks!
Sir, it's a miracle she missed them!

199
00:15:24.283 --> 00:15:26.578
- Will you be saving her, then?
- I can't swim!

200
00:15:28.747 --> 00:15:30.747
Pearl of the King's Navy, you are!

201
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:32.500
Do not lose these!

202
00:15:46.973 --> 00:15:48.182
What was that?

203
00:16:22.842 --> 00:16:24.467
Make way!

204
00:16:31.016 --> 00:16:32.016
I got her!

205
00:16:33.395 --> 00:16:34.561
She's not breathing!

206
00:16:34.646 --> 00:16:35.646
Move!

207
00:16:42.737 --> 00:16:44.488
I never would've thought of that.

208
00:16:44.572 --> 00:16:46.822
Clearly you've never been to Singapore.

209
00:16:52.413 --> 00:16:54.040
Where did you get that?

210
00:16:56.251 --> 00:16:58.461
On your feet.

211
00:16:59.837 --> 00:17:01.088
Elizabeth!

212
00:17:02.423 --> 00:17:04.423
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

213
00:17:09.388 --> 00:17:11.973
- Shoot him!
- Father! Commodore...

214
00:17:12.016 --> 00:17:14.058
...do you intend to kill my rescuer?

215
00:17:21.442 --> 00:17:23.235
I believe thanks are in order.

216
00:17:27.865 --> 00:17:30.700
Had a brush with the East India
Trading Company, did we?

217
00:17:30.743 --> 00:17:32.034
Pirate?

218
00:17:33.288 --> 00:17:34.579
Hang him.

219
00:17:34.664 --> 00:17:37.414
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

220
00:17:38.668 --> 00:17:40.002
Well, well.

221
00:17:40.045 --> 00:17:42.546
Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

222
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.257
Captain Jack Sparrow,
if you please, sir.

223
00:17:45.341 --> 00:17:47.218
Well, I don't see your ship...

224
00:17:47.261 --> 00:17:48.426
...captain.

225
00:17:48.511 --> 00:17:50.887
I'm in the market, as it were.

226
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:52.931
He said he'd come to commandeer one.

227
00:17:53.014 --> 00:17:55.809
I told you he was telling the truth.
These are his, sir.

228
00:17:59.272 --> 00:18:02.399
No additional shots nor powder.

229
00:18:04.235 --> 00:18:06.070
A compass that doesn't point north.

230
00:18:11.075 --> 00:18:13.743
And I half expected it
to be made of wood.

231
00:18:16.247 --> 00:18:19.166
You are, without doubt,
the worst pirate I've heard of.

232
00:18:20.168 --> 00:18:21.584
But you have heard of me.

233
00:18:24.546 --> 00:18:27.089
Commodore, I really must protest!

234
00:18:27.174 --> 00:18:28.757
Carefully, lieutenant.

235
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.093
Pirate or not, this man saved my life!

236
00:18:31.137 --> 00:18:34.640
One good deed is not enough to redeem
a man of a lifetime of wickedness!

237
00:18:34.725 --> 00:18:36.432
But it seems enough to condemn him.

238
00:18:36.516 --> 00:18:37.976
Indeed.

239
00:18:39.519 --> 00:18:41.229
Finally.

240
00:18:41.272 --> 00:18:43.606
Wait, don't shoot!

241
00:18:43.648 --> 00:18:44.982
I knew you'd warm up to me.

242
00:18:45.066 --> 00:18:47.862
Commodore Norrington,
my effects, please.

243
00:18:47.946 --> 00:18:49.613
And my hat.

244
00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.572
Commodore.

245
00:18:54.117 --> 00:18:57.454
- Elizabeth. It is Elizabeth, isn't it?
- It's Miss Swann.

246
00:18:57.496 --> 00:19:00.123
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.

247
00:19:00.166 --> 00:19:02.793
Come, dear, we don't have all day.

248
00:19:04.128 --> 00:19:05.546
Now, if you'll be very kind.

249
00:19:22.563 --> 00:19:23.979
Easy on the goods, darling.

250
00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.815
You're despicable.

251
00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.944
Sticks and stones, love.

252
00:19:28.986 --> 00:19:30.569
I saved your life, you save mine.

253
00:19:30.654 --> 00:19:31.654
We're square.

254
00:19:32.657 --> 00:19:33.863
Gentlemen...

255
00:19:33.948 --> 00:19:35.408
...my lady...

256
00:19:35.493 --> 00:19:38.827
...you will always remember this
as the day you almost caught...

257
00:19:38.912 --> 00:19:41.331
...Captain Jack Sparrow!

258
00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:59.849
Whoa!

259
00:19:59.934 --> 00:20:01.392
Now, will you shoot him?

260
00:20:01.476 --> 00:20:03.144
Open fire!

261
00:20:04.896 --> 00:20:06.064
Ahh!

262
00:20:10.444 --> 00:20:11.860
Burn his heels!

263
00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:21.997
Take steady aim.

264
00:20:22.039 --> 00:20:23.371
Fire!

265
00:20:27.294 --> 00:20:29.296
Take cover, men!

266
00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.297
Gillette...

267
00:20:31.382 --> 00:20:34.217
...Mr. Sparrow has a dawn
appointment with the gallows.

268
00:20:34.594 --> 00:20:36.593
I would hate for him to miss it.

269
00:20:40.598 --> 00:20:42.016
Search upstairs!

270
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.561
Look lively, men!

271
00:21:26.686 --> 00:21:28.062
Whoa!

272
00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.947
Right where I left you.

273
00:22:26.497 --> 00:22:28.330
Not where I left you.

274
00:22:38.924 --> 00:22:40.759
You're the one they're hunting.

275
00:22:41.761 --> 00:22:42.928
The pirate!

276
00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.807
You seem somewhat familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

277
00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:49.519
I make a point of avoiding
familiarity with pirates.

278
00:22:49.602 --> 00:22:50.643
Ah...

279
00:22:50.686 --> 00:22:53.354
It would be a shame to put
a black mark on your record.

280
00:22:53.439 --> 00:22:54.940
So if you'll excuse me...

281
00:22:58.445 --> 00:23:00.611
Do you think this wise, boy?

282
00:23:01.573 --> 00:23:04.740
Crossing blades with a pirate?

283
00:23:04.825 --> 00:23:06.201
You threatened Miss Swann.

284
00:23:09.246 --> 00:23:10.581
Only a little.

285
00:23:24.179 --> 00:23:27.347
You know what you're doing,
I'll give you that. Excellent form.

286
00:23:28.223 --> 00:23:29.932
But how's your footwork?

287
00:23:30.017 --> 00:23:32.102
If I step here...

288
00:23:33.481 --> 00:23:34.897
Very good.

289
00:23:34.939 --> 00:23:37.024
And now I step again.

290
00:23:41.737 --> 00:23:43.071
Ta.

291
00:24:02.967 --> 00:24:04.634
That is a wonderful trick.

292
00:24:05.929 --> 00:24:09.598
Except, once again,
you are between me and my way out.

293
00:24:09.682 --> 00:24:10.806
And now...

294
00:24:11.435 --> 00:24:12.850
...you have no weapon.

295
00:24:35.207 --> 00:24:36.832
Who makes all these?

296
00:24:38.292 --> 00:24:39.629
I do.

297
00:24:39.672 --> 00:24:41.963
And I practice with them...

298
00:24:42.506 --> 00:24:43.632
...three hours a day.

299
00:24:45.466 --> 00:24:47.635
You need to find yourself a girl, mate.

300
00:24:54.308 --> 00:24:57.228
Or... perhaps the reason
you practice three hours a day

301
00:24:57.312 --> 00:24:59.147
is that you already found one,

302
00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:02.818
and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

303
00:25:02.902 --> 00:25:05.320
You're not a eunuch, are you?

304
00:25:05.405 --> 00:25:08.365
I practice three hours a day
so that when I meet a pirate,

305
00:25:08.449 --> 00:25:09.824
I can kill him!

306
00:26:27.069 --> 00:26:28.111
You cheated.

307
00:26:28.196 --> 00:26:29.444
Pirate.

308
00:26:33.034 --> 00:26:35.076
- Move away!
- No.

309
00:26:35.118 --> 00:26:36.494
Please move?

310
00:26:36.578 --> 00:26:37.579
No!

311
00:26:37.622 --> 00:26:40.415
I cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

312
00:26:42.959 --> 00:26:44.959
This shot is not meant for you.

313
00:26:55.306 --> 00:26:57.306
There he is! Over here!

314
00:26:59.308 --> 00:27:01.266
Excellent work, Mr. Brown.

315
00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:05.147
You've assisted in the capture
of a dangerous fugitive.

316
00:27:05.232 --> 00:27:07.524
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

317
00:27:08.525 --> 00:27:11.112
I trust you will always remember
that this is the day

318
00:27:11.154 --> 00:27:14.615
Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.

319
00:27:14.658 --> 00:27:16.408
Take him away.

320
00:27:20.705 --> 00:27:23.623
- Come here, boy!
- Smell it?

321
00:27:23.666 --> 00:27:27.002
- Come here, boy!
- You want a nice, juicy bone?

322
00:27:27.087 --> 00:27:29.213
- Hey!
- Come here, boy!

323
00:27:29.296 --> 00:27:31.798
- Come here, boy!
- You can keep doing that forever.

324
00:27:31.883 --> 00:27:34.092
The dog is never going to move.

325
00:27:34.135 --> 00:27:38.430
Well, excuse us if we haven't resigned
ourselves to the gallows just yet!

326
00:27:39.474 --> 00:27:40.891
Come on!

327
00:27:45.147 --> 00:27:46.438
There you go, miss.

328
00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.275
It was a difficult day for you,
I'm sure.

329
00:27:49.317 --> 00:27:51.986
I suspected Commodore Norrington
would propose,

330
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.655
but I must admit,
I wasn't entirely prepared for it.

331
00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.991
I meant you being
threatened by that pirate!

332
00:27:57.033 --> 00:27:58.283
Sounds terrifying!

333
00:27:59.034 --> 00:28:01.787
Oh... Yes, it was terrifying.

334
00:28:01.831 --> 00:28:03.831
But... the Commodore proposed!

335
00:28:03.915 --> 00:28:05.498
Fancy that.

336
00:28:05.583 --> 00:28:07.167
Now that's a smart match, miss,

337
00:28:07.251 --> 00:28:09.377
if it's not too bold to say.

338
00:28:09.463 --> 00:28:10.838
It is a smart match.

339
00:28:12.006 --> 00:28:13.798
He's a fine man.

340
00:28:15.092 --> 00:28:17.596
He's what any woman
should dream of marrying.

341
00:28:18.679 --> 00:28:20.806
Well, that Will Turner,

342
00:28:20.848 --> 00:28:23.016
he's a fine man too.

343
00:28:23.058 --> 00:28:24.852
That is too bold.

344
00:28:24.936 --> 00:28:27.021
Well, beggin' your pardon, miss.

345
00:28:27.063 --> 00:28:28.730
It was not my place.

346
00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.782
Has my daughter given
you an answer yet?

347
00:29:20.866 --> 00:29:22.573
No, she hasn't.

348
00:29:22.616 --> 00:29:24.953
Well, she has had a very trying day.

349
00:29:26.623 --> 00:29:28.789
Ghastly weather, don't you think?

350
00:29:28.873 --> 00:29:30.750
Bleak. Really bleak.

351
00:29:32.546 --> 00:29:33.545
What's that?

352
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:36.506
Cannon fire!

353
00:29:37.882 --> 00:29:39.759
Return fire!

354
00:29:39.802 --> 00:29:42.846
I know those guns!

355
00:29:47.809 --> 00:29:49.811
It's the Pearl!

356
00:29:49.894 --> 00:29:51.605
Black Pearl?

357
00:29:54.107 --> 00:29:55.733
I've heard stories.

358
00:29:55.776 --> 00:29:59.778
She's been preying on ships and
settlements for near ten years.

359
00:29:59.863 --> 00:30:01.448
Never leaves any survivors.

360
00:30:01.533 --> 00:30:02.949
No survivors.

361
00:30:02.992 --> 00:30:05.827
Then where do the stories
come from, I wonder?

362
00:30:15.129 --> 00:30:16.882
Clear the dock!

363
00:30:30.435 --> 00:30:32.102
Mama!

364
00:30:38.694 --> 00:30:40.320
Hoist your oars!

365
00:30:45.283 --> 00:30:47.577
Come on, you!

366
00:31:38.336 --> 00:31:40.171
Sight the muzzle flash.

367
00:31:40.214 --> 00:31:41.214
Aim for the flashes.

368
00:31:41.298 --> 00:31:43.383
I need a full spread, fore and aft.

369
00:31:43.425 --> 00:31:45.092
Mr. Stevens, more cartridges!

370
00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:49.097
Governor!
Barricade yourself in my office.

371
00:31:50.056 --> 00:31:51.056
Good God!

372
00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.724
That's an order.

373
00:32:09.659 --> 00:32:11.953
Don't!

374
00:32:12.745 --> 00:32:13.912
Hello, chum.

375
00:32:18.168 --> 00:32:19.711
Up there! Go!

376
00:32:29.512 --> 00:32:32.140
Miss! They've come to kidnap you!

377
00:32:32.224 --> 00:32:34.766
- What?
- You're the governor's daughter!

378
00:32:34.851 --> 00:32:36.019
In here!

379
00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:42.024
They haven't seen you. Hide, and the
first chance you get, run to the fort!

380
00:32:51.534 --> 00:32:53.160
Got ya! Haven't I?

381
00:32:56.664 --> 00:33:00.166
No! No! It's hot!

382
00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:02.128
- I'm burning!
- Come on!

383
00:33:06.591 --> 00:33:07.924
Come on, me lads!

384
00:33:35.161 --> 00:33:37.120
Come out.

385
00:33:46.088 --> 00:33:48.923
We know you're here, poppet.

386
00:33:50.009 --> 00:33:51.175
Poppet.

387
00:33:51.259 --> 00:33:52.302
Come out...

388
00:33:53.221 --> 00:33:55.431
...and we promise we won't hurt you.

389
00:33:55.516 --> 00:33:56.765
Eh?

390
00:33:58.517 --> 00:34:00.519
We will find you, poppet.

391
00:34:01.561 --> 00:34:03.980
You've got something of ours,

392
00:34:04.023 --> 00:34:05.815
and it calls to us.

393
00:34:11.531 --> 00:34:14.032
The gold calls to us.

394
00:34:15.075 --> 00:34:16.243
The gold.

395
00:34:22.375 --> 00:34:24.416
Hello, poppet.

396
00:34:24.961 --> 00:34:25.962
Parley!

397
00:34:26.671 --> 00:34:27.879
What?

398
00:34:27.921 --> 00:34:29.089
Parley.

399
00:34:29.173 --> 00:34:30.589
I invoke the right of parley.

400
00:34:30.674 --> 00:34:34.594
According to the code of Brethren, set
down by pirates Morgan and Bartholomew,

401
00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:37.764
- you have to take me to your captain.
- I know the code.

402
00:34:37.849 --> 00:34:40.557
If an adversary demands parley,
you can do them no harm

403
00:34:40.599 --> 00:34:43.394
- until the parley is complete.
- To blazes with the code!

404
00:34:43.478 --> 00:34:45.437
She wants to be taken to the captain.

405
00:34:46.941 --> 00:34:49.234
And she'll go, without a fuss.

406
00:34:50.277 --> 00:34:53.319
We must honor the code.

407
00:35:03.958 --> 00:35:05.332
Say goodbye!

408
00:35:10.048 --> 00:35:11.297
Goodbye.

409
00:35:15.426 --> 00:35:17.221
- Come on!
- Elizabeth!

410
00:35:18.722 --> 00:35:19.849
Well!

411
00:35:26.647 --> 00:35:28.229
Out of my way, scum!

412
00:35:40.869 --> 00:35:43.786
My sympathies, friend.
You've no manner of luck at all.

413
00:36:06.354 --> 00:36:09.564
Come on, doggy!
It's just you and me now.

414
00:36:09.649 --> 00:36:12.024
It's you and old Jack.
Come on.

415
00:36:12.108 --> 00:36:13.818
Come on. That's a boy!

416
00:36:13.861 --> 00:36:16.028
Good boy. Come get your bone!

417
00:36:16.112 --> 00:36:19.990
That's a good boy.
Come on, a bit closer, a bit closer.

418
00:36:20.075 --> 00:36:22.117
That's it! That's it, doggy!

419
00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.580
Come on, you filthy,
slimy, mangy cur!

420
00:36:26.832 --> 00:36:28.499
Don't do that. No, no, no!

421
00:36:28.541 --> 00:36:30.209
I didn't mean it! I didn't...

422
00:36:37.092 --> 00:36:38.634
This ain't the armory!

423
00:36:40.345 --> 00:36:41.554
Well, well, well.

424
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.515
Look what we have here, Twigg.

425
00:36:44.599 --> 00:36:46.685
Captain Jack Sparrow.

426
00:36:47.852 --> 00:36:50.019
Last time I saw you,

427
00:36:50.062 --> 00:36:51.855
you were all alone

428
00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:54.692
on a godforsaken island,

429
00:36:54.734 --> 00:36:56.945
shrinking into the distance.

430
00:36:57.029 --> 00:36:59.529
His fortunes aren't improved much.

431
00:36:59.613 --> 00:37:03.034
Worry about your own fortunes,
gentlemen.

432
00:37:03.077 --> 00:37:06.120
The deepest circle of hell
is reserved for betrayers

433
00:37:06.204 --> 00:37:07.746
and mutineers.

434
00:37:11.876 --> 00:37:13.377
So there is a curse.

435
00:37:15.087 --> 00:37:16.463
That's interesting.

436
00:37:16.549 --> 00:37:18.800
You know nothing of hell.

437
00:37:27.474 --> 00:37:29.475
That's very interesting.

438
00:38:04.929 --> 00:38:07.472
I didn't know we was takin' on captives.

439
00:38:07.557 --> 00:38:10.601
She's invoked the right of parley
with Captain Barbossa.

440
00:38:10.685 --> 00:38:14.520
- I am here to negotia...
- You will speak when spoken to!

441
00:38:15.523 --> 00:38:17.608
And ye will not lay a hand on those

442
00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:20.068
under the protection of parley.

443
00:38:20.695 --> 00:38:21.862
Aye, sir.

444
00:38:24.574 --> 00:38:26.492
My apologies, miss.

445
00:38:27.577 --> 00:38:28.911
Captain Barbossa,

446
00:38:28.953 --> 00:38:33.374
I am here to negotiate the cessation
of hostilities against Port Royal.

447
00:38:34.459 --> 00:38:38.504
A lot of long words in there, miss.
We are naught but humble pirates.

448
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:41.174
What is it that you want?

449
00:38:41.258 --> 00:38:43.550
I want you to leave
and never come back.

450
00:38:46.012 --> 00:38:48.639
I'm disinclined
to acquiesce to your request.

451
00:38:50.225 --> 00:38:52.558
Means "no."

452
00:38:53.978 --> 00:38:54.978
Very well.

453
00:38:57.690 --> 00:38:59.566
I'll drop it.

454
00:39:03.613 --> 00:39:08.241
Me holds are burstin' with swag!
That bit of shine matters to us?

455
00:39:08.325 --> 00:39:09.368
Why?

456
00:39:10.495 --> 00:39:12.788
It's what you've been searching for.

457
00:39:12.831 --> 00:39:14.497
I recognize the ship.

458
00:39:14.581 --> 00:39:17.458
I saw it eight years ago
on the crossing from England!

459
00:39:17.501 --> 00:39:18.670
Did you now?

460
00:39:21.672 --> 00:39:22.672
Fine.

461
00:39:23.674 --> 00:39:25.259
I suppose if it is worthless,

462
00:39:25.343 --> 00:39:27.177
then there's no point in me keeping it.

463
00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:28.512
No!

464
00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.524
You have a name, missy?

465
00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:43.693
Elizabeth...

466
00:39:43.777 --> 00:39:45.111
...Turner.

467
00:39:46.238 --> 00:39:48.323
I'm a maid in the governor's household.

468
00:39:51.618 --> 00:39:53.036
Miss Turner!

469
00:39:54.247 --> 00:39:55.496
Turner!

470
00:39:55.539 --> 00:39:56.956
Bootstrap!

471
00:40:01.003 --> 00:40:03.671
And how does a maid come
to own a trinket such as that?

472
00:40:03.714 --> 00:40:06.299
Family heirloom, perhaps?

473
00:40:06.383 --> 00:40:08.886
I didn't steal it,
if that's what you mean.

474
00:40:10.472 --> 00:40:13.555
Very well. You hand it over,
we'll put your town to our rudder,

475
00:40:13.639 --> 00:40:14.849
and ne'er return.

476
00:40:28.572 --> 00:40:29.571
Our bargain?

477
00:40:32.576 --> 00:40:34.411
Still the guns and stow 'em.

478
00:40:34.454 --> 00:40:37.289
Signal the men, set the flags
and make good to clear port.

479
00:40:37.373 --> 00:40:39.081
Wait! You have to take me to shore.

480
00:40:39.124 --> 00:40:41.751
According to the code of
the order of the Brethren...

481
00:40:41.835 --> 00:40:45.505
Your return to shore was not part
of our negotiations nor our agreements,

482
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:46.757
so I must do nothin'.

483
00:40:46.841 --> 00:40:49.927
Secondly, you must be a pirate
for the pirate's code to apply,

484
00:40:49.969 --> 00:40:51.594
and you're not, and thirdly...

485
00:40:51.637 --> 00:40:54.389
...the code is more of what
you'd call a guideline,

486
00:40:54.432 --> 00:40:55.932
instead of actual rules.

487
00:40:55.974 --> 00:40:58.391
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,

488
00:40:58.434 --> 00:40:59.936
Miss Turner.

489
00:41:20.623 --> 00:41:23.041
They've taken her!
They've taken Elizabeth!

490
00:41:23.125 --> 00:41:25.213
Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.

491
00:41:26.296 --> 00:41:28.381
We have to hunt them down!
We must save her!

492
00:41:28.465 --> 00:41:30.506
And where do you propose we start?

493
00:41:31.761 --> 00:41:35.428
If you have any information concerning
my daughter, please share it.

494
00:41:37.724 --> 00:41:39.475
That Jack Sparrow!

495
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.812
He talked about the Black Pearl.

496
00:41:41.854 --> 00:41:43.771
Mentioned it is more what he did.

497
00:41:45.356 --> 00:41:48.484
Ask him where it is! Make a deal
with him, he could lead us to it.

498
00:41:48.527 --> 00:41:50.027
No.

499
00:41:50.112 --> 00:41:53.406
The pirates who invaded this fort
left Sparrow locked in his cell,

500
00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:56.491
ergo they are not his allies.

501
00:41:56.534 --> 00:41:59.537
Governor, we will establish
their most likely course...

502
00:41:59.621 --> 00:42:01.497
That's not good enough!

503
00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:03.499
Mr. Turner...

504
00:42:03.542 --> 00:42:07.086
...you are not a military man,
you are not a sailor.

505
00:42:08.128 --> 00:42:09.506
You are a blacksmith.

506
00:42:09.549 --> 00:42:12.383
And this is not the moment
for rash actions!

507
00:42:14.678 --> 00:42:17.679
Do not make the mistake of thinking
you are the only man here

508
00:42:17.763 --> 00:42:19.266
who cares for Elizabeth.

509
00:42:25.272 --> 00:42:27.022
Please...

510
00:42:31.402 --> 00:42:32.612
You! Sparrow!

511
00:42:32.696 --> 00:42:33.696
Aye?

512
00:42:33.739 --> 00:42:36.364
You are familiar with that ship,
the Black Pearl?

513
00:42:36.407 --> 00:42:37.782
I've heard of it.

514
00:42:37.867 --> 00:42:40.536
Where does it make berth?

515
00:42:41.538 --> 00:42:43.496
Have you not heard the stories?

516
00:42:45.207 --> 00:42:47.168
Captain Barbossa

517
00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:48.961
and his crew of miscreants

518
00:42:49.046 --> 00:42:51.631
sail from the dreaded Isla de Muerte.

519
00:42:51.715 --> 00:42:54.509
It's an island that
cannot be found, except

520
00:42:54.552 --> 00:42:57.636
by those who already know where it is.

521
00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.387
The ship's real enough,

522
00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:02.891
therefore its anchorage must be
a real place. Where is it?

523
00:43:03.894 --> 00:43:05.061
Why ask me?

524
00:43:05.729 --> 00:43:07.313
Because you're a pirate.

525
00:43:07.396 --> 00:43:10.066
And you want to turn
pirate yourself. ls that it?

526
00:43:11.317 --> 00:43:12.318
Never!

527
00:43:16.071 --> 00:43:17.740
They took Miss Swann.

528
00:43:17.783 --> 00:43:19.617
Oh. So it is that you found a girl!

529
00:43:19.701 --> 00:43:21.493
I see.

530
00:43:21.577 --> 00:43:24.331
If you're intending to brave all,
hasten to her rescue,

531
00:43:24.415 --> 00:43:26.374
and so win fair lady's heart...

532
00:43:26.416 --> 00:43:29.043
...you'll have to do it alone, mate.

533
00:43:29.086 --> 00:43:31.169
I see no profit in it for me.

534
00:43:32.254 --> 00:43:33.506
I can get you out of here.

535
00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:35.256
How's that? The key's run off.

536
00:43:35.299 --> 00:43:36.925
I helped build these cells.

537
00:43:37.009 --> 00:43:39.762
These are half-pin barrel hinges.

538
00:43:41.056 --> 00:43:44.349
With the right leverage,
and the proper application of strength,

539
00:43:45.476 --> 00:43:46.894
the door will lift free.

540
00:43:49.272 --> 00:43:50.522
What's your name?

541
00:43:50.606 --> 00:43:52.524
Will Turner.

542
00:43:53.818 --> 00:43:56.153
That would be short for William,
I imagine.

543
00:43:56.238 --> 00:43:57.404
Good, strong name.

544
00:43:58.406 --> 00:44:00.322
No doubt named for your father?

545
00:44:01.953 --> 00:44:03.034
Yes.

546
00:44:03.119 --> 00:44:05.036
Uh-huh.

547
00:44:05.913 --> 00:44:07.247
Well, Mr. Turner,

548
00:44:07.288 --> 00:44:08.498
I've changed me mind.

549
00:44:09.167 --> 00:44:12.168
If you spring me from this cell,
I swear, on pain of death,

550
00:44:12.253 --> 00:44:14.462
I shall take you to the Black Pearl,

551
00:44:14.505 --> 00:44:16.172
and your bonny lass.

552
00:44:16.258 --> 00:44:18.259
Do we have an accord?

553
00:44:21.762 --> 00:44:23.596
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

554
00:44:23.639 --> 00:44:24.806
Get me out.

555
00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:32.105
- Hurry! Someone will have heard that.
- Not without my effects.

556
00:44:38.696 --> 00:44:40.196
We're going to steal the ship?

557
00:44:41.991 --> 00:44:42.991
That ship?

558
00:44:43.075 --> 00:44:44.907
Commandeer.

559
00:44:44.992 --> 00:44:47.245
We're going to commandeer that ship.

560
00:44:47.329 --> 00:44:48.414
Nautical term.

561
00:44:49.083 --> 00:44:51.166
One question about your business, boy,

562
00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:52.667
or there's no use going.

563
00:44:52.752 --> 00:44:54.251
This girl...

564
00:44:54.335 --> 00:44:57.045
...how far are you willing to go
to save her?

565
00:44:57.130 --> 00:44:58.466
I'd die for her.

566
00:44:58.508 --> 00:44:59.715
Oh, good.

567
00:44:59.799 --> 00:45:01.801
No worries then.

568
00:45:20.822 --> 00:45:23.364
This is either madness or brilliance.

569
00:45:24.159 --> 00:45:27.786
It's remarkable how often
those two traits coincide.

570
00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:01.236
Everyone stay calm!
We're taking over the ship.

571
00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:03.029
Aye! Avast!

572
00:46:06.242 --> 00:46:08.576
This ship cannot be crewed by two men.

573
00:46:09.453 --> 00:46:11.248
You'll never make it out of the bay.

574
00:46:11.289 --> 00:46:12.914
Son...

575
00:46:13.956 --> 00:46:16.792
...I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

576
00:46:16.876 --> 00:46:18.420
Savvy?

577
00:46:21.923 --> 00:46:22.923
Commodore!

578
00:46:22.966 --> 00:46:25.592
- Sir!
- They're taking the Dauntless!

579
00:46:27.264 --> 00:46:28.346
Commodore!

580
00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:30.765
They're taking the ship!

581
00:46:31.517 --> 00:46:34.102
Sparrow and Turner!
They're taking the Dauntless!

582
00:46:34.144 --> 00:46:35.602
Rash, Turner.

583
00:46:35.687 --> 00:46:37.271
Too rash.

584
00:46:38.815 --> 00:46:43.028
That is, without doubt,
the worst pirate I have ever seen.

585
00:46:46.324 --> 00:46:47.615
Here they come.

586
00:46:52.454 --> 00:46:54.705
Bring her around!
Bring her around!

587
00:47:01.254 --> 00:47:04.424
Search every cabin, every hold,
down to the bilges.

588
00:47:17.563 --> 00:47:20.356
Check the aft!

589
00:47:20.441 --> 00:47:22.816
Sailors, back to the Interceptor!
Now!

590
00:47:22.859 --> 00:47:24.235
Quickly, men

591
00:47:25.613 --> 00:47:26.904
Whoa!

592
00:47:29.323 --> 00:47:33.245
Thank you, commodore,
for getting us ready to make way.

593
00:47:33.329 --> 00:47:35.913
We'd have had a hard time
of it by ourselves.

594
00:47:39.168 --> 00:47:41.209
Set topsails and clear up this mess.

595
00:47:41.294 --> 00:47:43.837
With the wind a quarter astern,
we won't catch them!

596
00:47:43.922 --> 00:47:46.841
I don't need to. Just get them
in range of the long nines.

597
00:47:46.926 --> 00:47:49.009
Hands, come about! Run out the guns!

598
00:47:49.052 --> 00:47:50.428
Bring out the guns!

599
00:47:50.512 --> 00:47:53.097
We are to fire on our own ship, sir?

600
00:47:53.181 --> 00:47:57.017
I'd rather see her at the bottom of the
ocean than in the hands of a pirate.

601
00:47:58.311 --> 00:48:01.647
Commodore! He's disabled
the rudder chain, sir.

602
00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:07.361
Abandon ship!

603
00:48:11.199 --> 00:48:13.616
Let go the gear
and sheet home.

604
00:48:13.701 --> 00:48:16.161
That's got to be the best pirate
I've ever seen.

605
00:48:17.373 --> 00:48:19.999
So it would seem.

606
00:48:28.466 --> 00:48:30.549
When I was a lad,
living in England,

607
00:48:30.634 --> 00:48:32.511
my mother raised me by herself.

608
00:48:32.596 --> 00:48:34.554
After she died, I came out here,

609
00:48:34.639 --> 00:48:36.473
looking for my father.

610
00:48:37.933 --> 00:48:39.059
Is that so?

611
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:41.812
My father,

612
00:48:41.896 --> 00:48:43.271
Bill Turner?

613
00:48:43.356 --> 00:48:46.943
At the jail, it was only after you
learned my name that you agreed to help.

614
00:48:47.027 --> 00:48:49.736
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.

615
00:48:49.779 --> 00:48:51.362
I'm not a simpleton, Jack.

616
00:48:51.405 --> 00:48:53.406
You knew my father.

617
00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:00.621
I knew him.

618
00:49:00.706 --> 00:49:03.625
Probably one of the few
who knew him as William Turner.

619
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:07.129
Everyone else just called him
"Bootstrap," or "Bootstrap Bill."

620
00:49:07.212 --> 00:49:08.212
Bootstrap?

621
00:49:09.216 --> 00:49:11.633
Good man.
Good pirate.

622
00:49:11.718 --> 00:49:13.803
I swear, you look just like him.

623
00:49:13.887 --> 00:49:14.928
It's not true.

624
00:49:14.971 --> 00:49:16.764
He was a merchant sailor.

625
00:49:16.849 --> 00:49:19.099
A good, respectable man
who obeyed the law.

626
00:49:19.183 --> 00:49:21.350
He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.

627
00:49:22.728 --> 00:49:25.439
My father was not a pirate!

628
00:49:26.607 --> 00:49:28.607
Put it away, son.

629
00:49:28.692 --> 00:49:30.609
It's not worth you getting beat again.

630
00:49:30.694 --> 00:49:31.821
You didn't beat me.

631
00:49:31.905 --> 00:49:35.240
You ignored the rules of engagement.
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.

632
00:49:35.282 --> 00:49:38.117
That's not much incentive
for me to fight fair, is it?

633
00:49:45.459 --> 00:49:48.713
Now as long as you're just
hanging there, pay attention.

634
00:49:48.797 --> 00:49:51.298
The only rules
that really matter are these:

635
00:49:51.383 --> 00:49:55.260
What a man can do,
and what a man can't do.

636
00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:57.137
For instance,

637
00:49:57.221 --> 00:50:00.347
you can accept that your father
was a pirate and a good man,

638
00:50:00.432 --> 00:50:01.475
or you can't.

639
00:50:01.517 --> 00:50:05.062
Pirate is in your blood, boy, so
you'll have to square with that someday.

640
00:50:05.937 --> 00:50:08.105
Now, me, for example.
I could let you drown,

641
00:50:08.148 --> 00:50:12.651
but I can't bring this ship into Tortuga
all by me onesies. Savvy?

642
00:50:12.986 --> 00:50:13.987
So...

643
00:50:19.034 --> 00:50:22.369
Can you sail under
the command of a pirate?

644
00:50:23.624 --> 00:50:24.955
Or can you not?

645
00:50:27.667 --> 00:50:28.709
Tortuga?

646
00:50:28.795 --> 00:50:30.544
Tortuga.

647
00:50:52.608 --> 00:50:55.028
More importantly, it is indeed

648
00:50:55.071 --> 00:50:56.947
a sad life that has never
breathed deep

649
00:50:57.031 --> 00:51:00.198
the sweet, proliferous bouquet
that is Tortuga. Savvy?

650
00:51:01.953 --> 00:51:03.077
What do you think?

651
00:51:07.374 --> 00:51:08.458
It'll linger.

652
00:51:08.543 --> 00:51:12.545
I'll tell you, mate, if every town
in the world were like this one,

653
00:51:12.629 --> 00:51:15.089
no man would ever feel unwanted.

654
00:51:17.051 --> 00:51:18.135
Scarlett!

655
00:51:20.054 --> 00:51:21.387
Not sure I deserved that.

656
00:51:23.181 --> 00:51:24.349
Giselle!

657
00:51:24.392 --> 00:51:25.390
Who was she?

658
00:51:25.474 --> 00:51:26.476
What?

659
00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:30.062
I may have deserved that.

660
00:51:32.316 --> 00:51:35.442
Curse you for breathing,
you slack-jawed idiot!

661
00:51:37.778 --> 00:51:39.905
Mother's love!

662
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.990
Jack!

663
00:51:41.992 --> 00:51:45.120
You should know better than to
wake a man when he's sleepin'.

664
00:51:45.204 --> 00:51:49.082
- It's bad luck.
- Fortunately, I know how to counter it.

665
00:51:49.167 --> 00:51:52.459
The man who did the waking buys
the man who was sleeping a drink,

666
00:51:52.544 --> 00:51:55.963
and the man who was sleeping drinks
it while listening to a proposition

667
00:51:56.047 --> 00:51:57.756
from the man who did the waking.

668
00:51:59.925 --> 00:52:01.761
Aye, that'll about do it.

669
00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:08.852
Blast! I'm already awake!

670
00:52:08.936 --> 00:52:10.311
That was for the smell.

671
00:52:13.607 --> 00:52:14.606
Eh...

672
00:52:20.781 --> 00:52:22.280
Keep a sharp eye.

673
00:52:29.413 --> 00:52:30.497
Now...

674
00:52:30.582 --> 00:52:33.043
...what's the nature
of this venture of your'n?

675
00:52:34.877 --> 00:52:39.299
I'm going after the Black Pearl.

676
00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:42.301
I know where it's going to be,

677
00:52:42.345 --> 00:52:44.135
and I'm gonna take it.

678
00:52:45.179 --> 00:52:46.181
Jack,

679
00:52:46.265 --> 00:52:48.557
it's a fool's errand!

680
00:52:48.642 --> 00:52:51.978
Well, you know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl!

681
00:52:52.021 --> 00:52:54.563
That's why I know
what Barbossa is up to.

682
00:52:55.149 --> 00:52:56.482
All I need is a crew.

683
00:52:57.192 --> 00:52:59.192
What I hear tell of Captain Barbossa,

684
00:52:59.276 --> 00:53:02.279
he's not a man to suffer fools,
nor strike a bargain with one!

685
00:53:02.322 --> 00:53:04.530
I'd say it's a good thing
I'm not a fool then.

686
00:53:04.616 --> 00:53:05.741
Prove me wrong!

687
00:53:06.407 --> 00:53:09.746
What makes you think Barbossa
will give up his ship to you?

688
00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:13.165
Let's just say
it's a matter of leverage, eh?

689
00:53:16.544 --> 00:53:17.836
Hm?

690
00:53:20.006 --> 00:53:21.048
Mm.

691
00:53:21.132 --> 00:53:22.507
Huh?

692
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:23.676
Hm...

693
00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:24.760
Mm-hm-hm.

694
00:53:29.391 --> 00:53:30.391
The kid?

695
00:53:31.977 --> 00:53:34.979
That is the child
of Bootstrap Bill Turner.

696
00:53:36.064 --> 00:53:38.525
His only child. Savvy?

697
00:53:38.609 --> 00:53:40.526
Is he now?

698
00:53:43.489 --> 00:53:45.865
Leverage, says you.

699
00:53:45.949 --> 00:53:48.534
I think I feel
a change in the wind, says I.

700
00:53:48.617 --> 00:53:50.369
- Mm.
- I'll find us a crew.

701
00:53:50.412 --> 00:53:53.329
There's bound to be some sailors
on this rock, crazy as you.

702
00:53:53.373 --> 00:53:55.749
One can only hope.

703
00:53:55.834 --> 00:53:58.583
- Take what you can!
- Give nothin' back!

704
00:54:23.444 --> 00:54:25.237
You'll be dining with the captain,

705
00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:27.656
and he requests you wear this.

706
00:54:28.615 --> 00:54:32.202
Tell the captain I'm "disinclined
to acquiesce to his request."

707
00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:35.622
He said you'd say that.

708
00:54:35.707 --> 00:54:38.083
He also said, if that be the case...

709
00:54:38.168 --> 00:54:39.917
...you'll be dining with the crew,

710
00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.795
and you'll be naked.

711
00:54:48.219 --> 00:54:49.344
Fine.

712
00:55:05.986 --> 00:55:09.574
There's no need to stand on ceremony
no call to impress anyone.

713
00:55:09.617 --> 00:55:11.992
You must be hungry.

714
00:55:29.426 --> 00:55:30.634
Try the wine.

715
00:55:35.474 --> 00:55:38.476
And the apples. One of those next.

716
00:55:46.777 --> 00:55:48.444
It's poisoned.

717
00:55:49.988 --> 00:55:52.323
There would be no sense
to be killing you.

718
00:55:52.366 --> 00:55:55.826
Then release me. You have your trinket.
I'm of no further value to you.

719
00:55:59.833 --> 00:56:01.874
You don't know what this is,

720
00:56:01.959 --> 00:56:03.335
do you?

721
00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:05.669
It's a pirate medallion.

722
00:56:05.711 --> 00:56:07.796
This is Aztec gold.

723
00:56:08.674 --> 00:56:11.466
One of 882 identical pieces

724
00:56:11.509 --> 00:56:15.096
they delivered in a stone chest
to Cortés himself.

725
00:56:16.182 --> 00:56:20.393
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

726
00:56:20.477 --> 00:56:24.313
But the greed of Cortés was insatiable.

727
00:56:24.356 --> 00:56:27.857
So the heathen gods
placed upon the gold...

728
00:56:29.737 --> 00:56:31.363
...a terrible curse.

729
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:37.242
Any mortal that removes but
a single piece from that stone chest...

730
00:56:38.245 --> 00:56:40.704
...shall be punished for eternity.

731
00:56:42.999 --> 00:56:46.377
I hardly believe in ghost stories
any more, Captain Barbossa.

732
00:56:46.462 --> 00:56:47.713
Aye.

733
00:56:48.506 --> 00:56:52.049
That's exactly what I thought
when we were first told the tale.

734
00:56:52.092 --> 00:56:55.011
Buried on an Isle of the Dead
what cannot be found,

735
00:56:55.053 --> 00:56:56.930
except for those who know where it is.

736
00:56:58.639 --> 00:56:59.973
Find it, we did.

737
00:57:01.643 --> 00:57:02.976
There be the chest.

738
00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:04.855
Inside be the gold.

739
00:57:05.813 --> 00:57:08.231
And we took 'em all!

740
00:57:08.275 --> 00:57:10.276
We spent 'em and traded 'em,

741
00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:12.028
and frittered 'em away

742
00:57:12.070 --> 00:57:14.821
on drink and food
and pleasurable company.

743
00:57:14.905 --> 00:57:16.908
The more we gave 'em away,

744
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:19.619
the more we came to realize...

745
00:57:20.913 --> 00:57:23.080
...the drink would not satisfy.

746
00:57:24.333 --> 00:57:27.084
Food turned to ash in our mouths...

747
00:57:27.752 --> 00:57:30.337
...and all the pleasurable company
in the world

748
00:57:30.421 --> 00:57:32.423
could not slake our lust.

749
00:57:34.301 --> 00:57:37.094
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

750
00:57:38.848 --> 00:57:41.517
Compelled by greed we were, but now...

751
00:57:41.601 --> 00:57:44.935
...we are consumed by it.

752
00:57:56.114 --> 00:57:59.032
There is one way we can end our curse.

753
00:58:03.121 --> 00:58:06.081
All the scattered pieces
of the Aztec gold

754
00:58:06.123 --> 00:58:07.541
must be restored,

755
00:58:07.625 --> 00:58:10.044
and the blood repaid.

756
00:58:12.798 --> 00:58:14.173
Thanks to ye,

757
00:58:14.258 --> 00:58:16.385
we have the final piece.

758
00:58:18.428 --> 00:58:20.720
And the... blood to be repaid?

759
00:58:20.805 --> 00:58:23.307
That's why there's no sense
to be killing ya.

760
00:58:24.101 --> 00:58:25.100
Yet.

761
00:58:27.144 --> 00:58:28.646
Apple?

762
00:58:31.192 --> 00:58:33.651
Ha-ha. Hah!

763
00:58:33.694 --> 00:58:36.611
Arrgh!

764
00:58:36.654 --> 00:58:38.197
No!

765
00:58:45.497 --> 00:58:46.497
I'm curious.

766
00:58:46.582 --> 00:58:49.499
After killing me, what is it
you're planning on doing next?

767
00:59:53.065 --> 00:59:55.274
Look!

768
00:59:55.359 --> 00:59:58.277
The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

769
00:59:59.069 --> 01:00:02.323
We are not among the living
and so we cannot die.

770
01:00:02.407 --> 01:00:04.073
But neither are we dead.

771
01:00:05.326 --> 01:00:09.121
For too long I've been parched of thirst
and unable to quench it.

772
01:00:09.206 --> 01:00:11.581
Too long I've been starvin' to death,

773
01:00:11.666 --> 01:00:13.291
and haven't died!

774
01:00:13.917 --> 01:00:15.711
I feel nothing.

775
01:00:16.504 --> 01:00:19.422
Not the wind on my face,
nor the spray of the sea...

776
01:00:20.841 --> 01:00:23.008
...nor the warmth of a woman's flesh.

777
01:00:24.011 --> 01:00:28.516
You best start believing
in ghost stories, Miss Turner.

778
01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:29.598
You're in one!

779
01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:50.620
What are you looking at?
Back to work!

780
01:00:59.839 --> 01:01:01.506
Feast your eyes, captain.

781
01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:04.508
All of them,
faithful hands before the mast.

782
01:01:04.592 --> 01:01:07.803
Every man worth his salt...

783
01:01:07.846 --> 01:01:09.889
...and crazy to boot.

784
01:01:09.974 --> 01:01:12.809
So this is your able-bodied crew?

785
01:01:18.649 --> 01:01:19.649
You, sailor!

786
01:01:19.734 --> 01:01:21.109
Cotton, sir.

787
01:01:21.152 --> 01:01:22.943
Mr. Cotton.

788
01:01:22.986 --> 01:01:26.321
Do you have the courage and fortitude
to follow orders and stay true

789
01:01:26.406 --> 01:01:27.991
in the face of danger and death?

790
01:01:28.033 --> 01:01:29.742
Mr. Cotton!

791
01:01:29.825 --> 01:01:30.952
Answer, man!

792
01:01:30.995 --> 01:01:32.412
He's a mute, sir.

793
01:01:32.496 --> 01:01:34.206
Poor devil had his tongue cut out.

794
01:01:34.291 --> 01:01:36.331
So he trained the parrot
to talk for him.

795
01:01:36.416 --> 01:01:38.294
No one's yet figured how.

796
01:01:41.504 --> 01:01:43.131
Mr. Cotton's parrot.

797
01:01:44.132 --> 01:01:45.633
Same question.

798
01:01:45.676 --> 01:01:48.428
- Wind in your sails.
- Wind in your sails.

799
01:01:49.556 --> 01:01:51.638
Mostly, we figure that means "yes."

800
01:01:51.681 --> 01:01:53.185
Of course it does.

801
01:01:53.267 --> 01:01:54.267
Satisfied?

802
01:01:55.227 --> 01:01:57.228
Well, you've proved they're mad!

803
01:01:57.313 --> 01:01:59.189
And what's the benefit for us?

804
01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:10.783
Anamaria!

805
01:02:12.703 --> 01:02:15.038
I suppose you didn't deserve
that one, either.

806
01:02:15.122 --> 01:02:17.039
No, that one I deserved.

807
01:02:17.081 --> 01:02:18.833
You stole my boat!

808
01:02:18.876 --> 01:02:19.958
Actually...

809
01:02:22.046 --> 01:02:24.422
Borrowed. Borrowed, without permission,

810
01:02:24.508 --> 01:02:27.090
but with every intention
of bringing it back to you.

811
01:02:27.175 --> 01:02:28.592
But you didn't!

812
01:02:28.676 --> 01:02:30.052
You'll get another one!

813
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:32.430
I will!

814
01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:33.889
A better one.

815
01:02:33.973 --> 01:02:35.890
A better one!

816
01:02:35.974 --> 01:02:37.560
- That one!
- What one?

817
01:02:40.272 --> 01:02:41.439
That one?

818
01:02:44.901 --> 01:02:46.611
Aye. That one.

819
01:02:46.695 --> 01:02:48.278
- What say you?
- Aye!

820
01:02:48.363 --> 01:02:49.738
Aye!

821
01:02:49.823 --> 01:02:51.823
Anchors away!

822
01:02:51.907 --> 01:02:54.117
No, no, no, no, no!
It's frightful bad luck

823
01:02:54.202 --> 01:02:55.703
to bring a woman aboard, sir.

824
01:02:55.746 --> 01:02:58.413
It'll be far worse not to have her.

825
01:03:32.116 --> 01:03:35.158
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find,

826
01:03:35.243 --> 01:03:37.703
with a compass that doesn't work?

827
01:03:37.787 --> 01:03:39.747
Aye, the compass doesn't point north,

828
01:03:39.790 --> 01:03:42.623
but we're not trying
to find north, are we?

829
01:03:53.303 --> 01:03:55.679
We should drop canvas, sir.

830
01:03:55.763 --> 01:03:57.805
She can hold a bit longer.

831
01:04:00.017 --> 01:04:03.563
What's in your head that's put you
in such a fine mood, captain?

832
01:04:03.647 --> 01:04:05.647
We're catching up.

833
01:04:20.664 --> 01:04:22.664
Time to go, poppet.

834
01:05:18.221 --> 01:05:22.640
Dead men tell no tales...

835
01:05:25.185 --> 01:05:27.854
Puts a chill in the bones,
how many honest sailors

836
01:05:27.897 --> 01:05:29.730
have been claimed by this passage.

837
01:05:45.205 --> 01:05:47.581
How is it that Jack
came by that compass?

838
01:05:47.624 --> 01:05:50.835
Not a lot's known about Jack Sparrow
'fore he showed up in Tortuga

839
01:05:50.919 --> 01:05:53.588
with a mind to go after
the treasure of Isla de Muerte.

840
01:05:53.673 --> 01:05:54.922
That was before I met him,

841
01:05:55.007 --> 01:05:57.173
back when he was captain
of the Black Pearl.

842
01:05:58.051 --> 01:05:59.052
What?

843
01:06:02.724 --> 01:06:04.182
He failed to mention that.

844
01:06:04.266 --> 01:06:06.517
He plays things closer to the vest now.

845
01:06:06.601 --> 01:06:08.687
And a hard-learned lesson it was.

846
01:06:08.771 --> 01:06:11.648
Three days out on the venture,
the first mate says,

847
01:06:11.732 --> 01:06:14.817
"Everything's an equal share.
That should mean the location

848
01:06:14.901 --> 01:06:18.280
of the treasure too,"
so Jack gives up the bearings.

849
01:06:18.448 --> 01:06:20.615
That night, there was a mutiny.

850
01:06:21.658 --> 01:06:24.327
They marooned Jack on an island
and left him to die.

851
01:06:24.412 --> 01:06:27.080
But not before he'd
gone mad with the heat.

852
01:06:28.790 --> 01:06:30.459
Ah...

853
01:06:31.169 --> 01:06:33.588
So that's the reason for all the...

854
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:37.339
Reason's got nothing to do with it.

855
01:06:38.301 --> 01:06:40.469
Now, Will, when a pirate's marooned,

856
01:06:40.553 --> 01:06:43.305
he's given a pistol with a single shot.
One shot...

857
01:06:43.347 --> 01:06:46.682
Well, that won't do much good hunting,
nor to be rescued.

858
01:06:46.767 --> 01:06:49.978
But after three weeks
of a starving belly and thirst,

859
01:06:50.021 --> 01:06:53.398
that pistol starts to look
real friendly.

860
01:06:53.483 --> 01:06:55.484
But Jack, he escaped the island,

861
01:06:55.568 --> 01:06:57.151
and still has that single shot.

862
01:06:57.235 --> 01:06:59.820
Oh, he won't use it, though,
save on one man.

863
01:07:00.822 --> 01:07:02.865
His mutinous first mate.

864
01:07:02.949 --> 01:07:04.909
- Barbossa.
- Aye.

865
01:07:06.161 --> 01:07:09.122
- How did Jack get off the island?
- Well, I'll tell ye.

866
01:07:09.165 --> 01:07:11.292
He waded out into the shallows,

867
01:07:11.335 --> 01:07:13.918
and he waited there three days
and three nights,

868
01:07:14.003 --> 01:07:17.839
till all manner of sea creatures
came acclimated to his presence.

869
01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.383
And on the fourth morning,

870
01:07:20.468 --> 01:07:24.596
he roped a couple of sea turtles,
lashed them together and made a raft.

871
01:07:26.849 --> 01:07:29.265
- He roped a couple of sea turtles.
- Aye.

872
01:07:29.350 --> 01:07:30.644
Sea turtles!

873
01:07:32.897 --> 01:07:34.897
What did he use for rope?

874
01:07:39.862 --> 01:07:41.445
Human hair.

875
01:07:42.447 --> 01:07:43.864
From my back.

876
01:07:45.032 --> 01:07:46.409
Let go the anchor!

877
01:07:46.494 --> 01:07:48.869
Lower the anchor line!

878
01:07:48.954 --> 01:07:51.371
Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore.

879
01:07:51.997 --> 01:07:53.125
Captain.

880
01:07:53.209 --> 01:07:54.917
What if the worst should happen?

881
01:07:55.795 --> 01:07:58.296
- Keep to the code.
- Aye. The code.

882
01:08:24.115 --> 01:08:25.281
Move.

883
01:08:25.365 --> 01:08:27.366
Ten years of hoarding swag!

884
01:08:27.409 --> 01:08:29.909
And now we finally get to spend it!

885
01:08:32.748 --> 01:08:33.748
Oh.

886
01:08:37.252 --> 01:08:40.046
Once we're quit of the curse,
we'll be rich men...

887
01:08:40.756 --> 01:08:44.465
...and you can buy an eye what
actually fits and is made of glass.

888
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:47.470
This one does splinter
something terrible!

889
01:08:47.555 --> 01:08:49.764
Stop rubbing it!

890
01:08:50.890 --> 01:08:52.016
Oh!

891
01:09:09.409 --> 01:09:12.453
What code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

892
01:09:12.495 --> 01:09:14.787
The pirates' code.

893
01:09:14.873 --> 01:09:16.289
Any man who falls behind...

894
01:09:16.332 --> 01:09:18.666
...is left behind.

895
01:09:20.003 --> 01:09:22.296
No heroes amongst thieves, eh?

896
01:09:23.008 --> 01:09:26.091
You know, for having
such a bleak outlook on pirates,

897
01:09:26.134 --> 01:09:29.052
you're well on your way
to becoming one.

898
01:09:29.554 --> 01:09:31.138
Sprung a man from jail...

899
01:09:32.474 --> 01:09:34.974
...commandeered a ship of the fleet,

900
01:09:35.017 --> 01:09:37.561
sailed with a buccaneer crew
out of Tortuga...

901
01:09:39.731 --> 01:09:42.982
...and you're completely
obsessed with treasure!

902
01:09:45.737 --> 01:09:46.862
That's not true.

903
01:09:47.572 --> 01:09:49.322
I am not obsessed with treasure.

904
01:09:56.539 --> 01:09:59.290
Not all treasure
is silver and gold, mate.

905
01:09:59.333 --> 01:10:01.377
Gentlemen, the time has come!

906
01:10:01.461 --> 01:10:02.671
Hurrah!

907
01:10:02.755 --> 01:10:04.880
Salvation is nigh!

908
01:10:04.965 --> 01:10:06.381
Yeah!

909
01:10:06.465 --> 01:10:09.176
- Our torment is near an end!
- Elizabeth.

910
01:10:09.844 --> 01:10:12.721
For ten years,
we've been tested and tried,

911
01:10:12.805 --> 01:10:14.431
and each man-jack of you here

912
01:10:14.516 --> 01:10:17.518
has proved his mettle 100 times over.

913
01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:19.853
And 100 times again!

914
01:10:19.896 --> 01:10:21.980
Yeah!

915
01:10:22.022 --> 01:10:23.607
Suffered, I have!

916
01:10:24.358 --> 01:10:26.193
Punished, we were,

917
01:10:26.236 --> 01:10:27.777
the lot of us,

918
01:10:27.861 --> 01:10:31.197
disproportionate to our crime!

919
01:10:31.283 --> 01:10:33.075
Right!

920
01:10:33.159 --> 01:10:34.367
Here it is!

921
01:10:38.038 --> 01:10:41.667
The cursed treasure of Cortés himself.

922
01:10:43.668 --> 01:10:46.213
Every last piece that went astray,

923
01:10:46.256 --> 01:10:48.007
we have returned.

924
01:10:48.049 --> 01:10:49.757
Save for this!

925
01:10:49.842 --> 01:10:51.260
- Yeah!
- Jack!

926
01:10:51.344 --> 01:10:53.971
Not yet!

927
01:10:54.055 --> 01:10:56.556
We'll wait for the opportune moment.

928
01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.391
...Despairing
of ever finding the lass.

929
01:10:59.434 --> 01:11:01.271
When's that?

930
01:11:01.355 --> 01:11:04.064
When it's of greatest profit to you?

931
01:11:04.107 --> 01:11:05.440
May I ask you something?

932
01:11:06.817 --> 01:11:09.152
Have I ever given you
reason not to trust me?

933
01:11:10.530 --> 01:11:11.529
Do us a favor.

934
01:11:11.572 --> 01:11:13.698
I know it's difficult for you,

935
01:11:13.741 --> 01:11:15.783
but please, stay here,

936
01:11:15.868 --> 01:11:18.745
and try not to do anything stupid.

937
01:11:21.415 --> 01:11:23.917
And who among us
has paid the blood sacrifice

938
01:11:24.002 --> 01:11:26.253
- owed to the heathen gods?
- Aye!

939
01:11:26.338 --> 01:11:29.173
And whose blood must yet be paid?

940
01:11:29.257 --> 01:11:30.923
Hers!

941
01:11:33.093 --> 01:11:37.679
You know the first thing I'm going
to do after the curse is lifted?

942
01:11:40.017 --> 01:11:43.436
Eat a whole bushel of apples!

943
01:11:51.195 --> 01:11:53.196
Begun by blood,

944
01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:55.282
by blood undone.

945
01:11:59.744 --> 01:12:00.788
Sorry, Jack.

946
01:12:00.872 --> 01:12:03.413
I'm not going to be your leverage.

947
01:12:12.632 --> 01:12:14.800
That's it?

948
01:12:14.842 --> 01:12:16.512
Waste not.

949
01:12:54.508 --> 01:12:55.842
Did it work?

950
01:12:55.884 --> 01:12:58.761
- I don't feel no different.
- How do we tell?

951
01:13:05.852 --> 01:13:07.353
You're not dead!

952
01:13:08.397 --> 01:13:10.898
No.

953
01:13:10.983 --> 01:13:12.315
He shot me!

954
01:13:12.358 --> 01:13:15.903
It didn't work!
The curse is still upon us!

955
01:13:20.993 --> 01:13:23.454
You! Maid! Your father,
what was his name?

956
01:13:23.538 --> 01:13:25.788
Was your father William Turner?

957
01:13:26.123 --> 01:13:27.372
No.

958
01:13:27.415 --> 01:13:30.918
Where's his child? The child that sailed
from England eight years ago?

959
01:13:31.003 --> 01:13:34.046
The child in whose veins flows
the blood of William Turner?

960
01:13:34.130 --> 01:13:35.381
Where?

961
01:13:41.762 --> 01:13:42.930
You two!

962
01:13:44.055 --> 01:13:46.142
- You brought us the wrong person!
- Yeah!

963
01:13:47.101 --> 01:13:48.101
No!

964
01:13:48.855 --> 01:13:51.563
She had the medallion!
She's the proper age!

965
01:13:51.648 --> 01:13:54.275
She said her name
was Turner. You heard her!

966
01:13:56.153 --> 01:13:58.821
- I think she lied to us!
- Yeah!

967
01:14:00.072 --> 01:14:02.407
You brought us here for nothing!

968
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:06.578
I won't take questionin' or second
guesses, not from you, Mr. Twigg!

969
01:14:06.621 --> 01:14:10.918
Who's to blame him? Every decision
you made has led us from bad to worse!

970
01:14:13.128 --> 01:14:15.713
It was you who sent
Bootstrap to the depths!

971
01:14:15.756 --> 01:14:16.755
Yeah!

972
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:22.135
And it's you who brought us
here in the first place!

973
01:14:23.931 --> 01:14:26.598
If any coward here dare challenge me,
let him speak!

974
01:14:28.893 --> 01:14:30.811
I say, we cut her throat,

975
01:14:30.896 --> 01:14:32.521
and spill all her blood!

976
01:14:32.605 --> 01:14:33.606
Just in case.

977
01:14:33.649 --> 01:14:35.106
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

978
01:14:35.191 --> 01:14:37.734
Yeah!

979
01:14:43.699 --> 01:14:44.950
The medallion!

980
01:14:44.992 --> 01:14:46.285
She's taken it!

981
01:14:46.327 --> 01:14:50.831
Get after her,
you feckless pack of ingrates!

982
01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:59.422
- Where's the oars?
- There's no oars!

983
01:14:59.465 --> 01:15:02.301
The oars have gone missing!
Find them!

984
01:15:11.394 --> 01:15:13.145
You!

985
01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:16.148
You're supposed to be dead!

986
01:15:16.191 --> 01:15:17.525
Am I not?

987
01:15:19.485 --> 01:15:20.485
Oh.

988
01:15:27.577 --> 01:15:29.034
Puh-la-lem.

989
01:15:30.415 --> 01:15:32.665
Puh-la-lie-lay-lool.

990
01:15:35.252 --> 01:15:36.876
Pah-lee-nee...

991
01:15:36.961 --> 01:15:39.713
...parsnip... par-sley...

992
01:15:39.798 --> 01:15:41.798
...par... partner, pardoner...

993
01:15:41.841 --> 01:15:42.840
Parley?

994
01:15:42.924 --> 01:15:44.759
That's the one! Parley!

995
01:15:45.511 --> 01:15:46.512
Parley!

996
01:15:46.555 --> 01:15:47.847
Parley?!

997
01:15:49.098 --> 01:15:52.893
Damn to the depths whatever
muttonhead thought up parley!

998
01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:56.813
That would be the French.

999
01:16:08.618 --> 01:16:09.827
Not more pirates!

1000
01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:11.911
Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

1001
01:16:12.873 --> 01:16:14.079
Mr. Gibbs?

1002
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:16.082
Hey, boy, where be Jack?

1003
01:16:17.209 --> 01:16:19.712
Jack? Jack Sparrow?

1004
01:16:20.962 --> 01:16:22.464
He fell behind.

1005
01:16:30.013 --> 01:16:31.557
Keep to the code!

1006
01:16:32.808 --> 01:16:35.601
- Weigh anchor!
- Hoist the sails!

1007
01:16:35.685 --> 01:16:37.354
Split-quick, you dibbies!

1008
01:16:43.568 --> 01:16:46.613
How the blazes
did you get off that island?

1009
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:51.450
When you marooned me on
that godforsaken spit of land,

1010
01:16:51.534 --> 01:16:53.913
you forgot one
very important thing, mate.

1011
01:16:55.497 --> 01:16:57.915
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

1012
01:16:57.957 --> 01:17:01.586
Ah, well, I won't be
making that mistake...

1013
01:17:01.629 --> 01:17:02.838
...again.

1014
01:17:03.631 --> 01:17:07.091
Gents, you all remember
Captain Jack Sparrow?

1015
01:17:07.175 --> 01:17:08.384
Aye.

1016
01:17:09.137 --> 01:17:10.137
Kill him.

1017
01:17:11.305 --> 01:17:13.972
The girl's blood didn't work, did it?

1018
01:17:16.644 --> 01:17:17.810
Hold your fire!

1019
01:17:24.442 --> 01:17:26.986
You know whose blood we need?

1020
01:17:28.698 --> 01:17:30.572
I know whose blood you need.

1021
01:17:37.707 --> 01:17:40.289
What sort of a man
trades a man's life for a ship?

1022
01:17:40.374 --> 01:17:41.626
A pirate.

1023
01:17:42.793 --> 01:17:44.130
Here.

1024
01:17:44.214 --> 01:17:45.922
Let me.

1025
01:17:45.965 --> 01:17:47.466
Thank you.

1026
01:17:48.843 --> 01:17:51.427
You said you gave Barbossa
my name as yours.

1027
01:17:53.305 --> 01:17:54.305
Why?

1028
01:17:57.642 --> 01:17:58.933
I don't know.

1029
01:18:00.896 --> 01:18:03.106
I'm sorry. A blacksmith's hands.

1030
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:07.736
- I know they're rough.
- No... I mean, yes, they are, but...

1031
01:18:10.196 --> 01:18:11.989
But don't stop.

1032
01:18:20.498 --> 01:18:21.915
Elizabeth!

1033
01:18:37.850 --> 01:18:39.184
It's yours.

1034
01:18:43.605 --> 01:18:47.025
I thought I'd lost it
the day they rescued me.

1035
01:18:47.067 --> 01:18:48.525
It was a gift from my father.

1036
01:18:48.568 --> 01:18:50.695
He sent it to me.

1037
01:18:56.368 --> 01:18:57.910
Why did you take it?

1038
01:19:00.038 --> 01:19:02.790
Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.

1039
01:19:04.375 --> 01:19:06.168
That would've been awful.

1040
01:19:09.631 --> 01:19:11.423
It wasn't your blood they needed.

1041
01:19:14.219 --> 01:19:16.471
It was my father's blood.

1042
01:19:18.932 --> 01:19:21.517
My blood.

1043
01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:27.815
The blood of a pirate.

1044
01:19:27.899 --> 01:19:30.025
Will, I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me.

1045
01:19:43.374 --> 01:19:47.000
So you expect to leave me standin' on
some beach, with nothing but a name

1046
01:19:47.085 --> 01:19:52.422
and your word it's the one I need,
and watch you sail away in my ship?

1047
01:19:52.507 --> 01:19:53.674
No.

1048
01:19:53.758 --> 01:19:57.886
I expect to leave you standing on some
beach with absolutely no name at all,

1049
01:19:57.929 --> 01:20:00.014
watching me sail away on my ship,

1050
01:20:00.099 --> 01:20:02.975
and then I'll shout
the name back to you.

1051
01:20:03.059 --> 01:20:04.393
Savvy?

1052
01:20:04.435 --> 01:20:07.479
That still leaves the problem
of me standing on some beach,

1053
01:20:07.564 --> 01:20:11.400
with naught but a name and your word
it's the one I need.

1054
01:20:12.442 --> 01:20:13.777
Of the two of us,

1055
01:20:13.862 --> 01:20:17.656
I am the only one who
hasn't committed mutiny.

1056
01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:21.742
Therefore, my word is
the one we'll be trusting.

1057
01:20:21.785 --> 01:20:23.538
Although...

1058
01:20:23.622 --> 01:20:26.248
I suppose I should be thanking you
because, in fact,

1059
01:20:26.291 --> 01:20:28.583
if you hadn't betrayed me
and left me to die,

1060
01:20:29.626 --> 01:20:33.923
I would have an equal share
in that curse, same as you.

1061
01:20:33.966 --> 01:20:35.340
Funny ol' world, isn't it?

1062
01:20:35.424 --> 01:20:36.757
Hm.

1063
01:20:39.345 --> 01:20:41.846
Captain! We're coming up
on the Interceptor.

1064
01:20:54.986 --> 01:20:57.028
I'm having a thought here, Barbossa.

1065
01:20:57.696 --> 01:20:59.488
What say we run up a flag of truce,

1066
01:20:59.573 --> 01:21:01.366
I scurry over to the Interceptor,

1067
01:21:01.450 --> 01:21:04.912
and I negotiate the return of your
medallion. What say you to that?

1068
01:21:05.872 --> 01:21:09.374
You see, Jack, that's exactly
the attitude that lost you the Pearl.

1069
01:21:09.459 --> 01:21:12.377
People are easier to search
when they're dead.

1070
01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:14.755
Lock him in the brig.

1071
01:21:27.017 --> 01:21:29.476
Hands aloft to loose ta'gallants!

1072
01:21:29.518 --> 01:21:32.813
With this wind dead astern,
she'll carry every sail we've got.

1073
01:21:32.856 --> 01:21:35.316
- What's happening?
- The Black Pearl!

1074
01:21:35.359 --> 01:21:36.566
She's gaining on us!

1075
01:21:41.157 --> 01:21:43.533
This is the fastest ship
in the Caribbean!

1076
01:21:43.618 --> 01:21:46.370
You can tell them that
after they've caught us!

1077
01:21:46.412 --> 01:21:48.329
We're shallower on the draft, right?

1078
01:21:48.372 --> 01:21:49.373
Aye.

1079
01:21:49.457 --> 01:21:51.539
Can't we lose them amongst those shoals?

1080
01:21:53.002 --> 01:21:54.710
We don't have to outrun 'em long.

1081
01:21:54.753 --> 01:21:56.047
Just long enough.

1082
01:21:56.090 --> 01:21:57.380
Lighten the ship!

1083
01:21:57.464 --> 01:21:58.631
Stem to stern!

1084
01:21:58.715 --> 01:22:01.802
Anything we can afford to lose,
see that it's lost!

1085
01:22:11.228 --> 01:22:13.230
Apparently, there's a leak.

1086
01:22:27.911 --> 01:22:31.081
Haul on the main brace!
Make ready the guns!

1087
01:22:31.124 --> 01:22:33.332
And run out the sweeps.

1088
01:23:01.569 --> 01:23:03.237
We're gonna need that.

1089
01:23:11.914 --> 01:23:14.707
It was a good plan, up till now.

1090
01:23:14.792 --> 01:23:16.250
Gibbs!

1091
01:23:16.293 --> 01:23:17.710
We have to make a stand.

1092
01:23:17.794 --> 01:23:19.212
We must fight!

1093
01:23:20.130 --> 01:23:22.256
- Load the guns!
- With what?

1094
01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:24.050
Anything! Everything!

1095
01:23:24.134 --> 01:23:25.843
Anything we have left!

1096
01:23:27.889 --> 01:23:29.847
Load the guns!

1097
01:23:29.931 --> 01:23:31.640
Case shot and langrage!

1098
01:23:31.725 --> 01:23:33.309
Nails and crushed glass!

1099
01:23:35.853 --> 01:23:37.022
With a will!

1100
01:23:58.334 --> 01:24:01.170
The Pearl's gonna luff up
on our port quarter!

1101
01:24:01.254 --> 01:24:03.839
She'll rake us without ever
presenting a target!

1102
01:24:03.881 --> 01:24:05.966
Lower the anchor on the right side.

1103
01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:07.968
On the starboard side!

1104
01:24:09.013 --> 01:24:12.140
- It has the element of surprise.
- You're daft, lady!

1105
01:24:12.183 --> 01:24:13.182
You both are!

1106
01:24:13.265 --> 01:24:14.683
Daft like Jack!

1107
01:24:15.394 --> 01:24:16.894
Lower the starboard anchor!

1108
01:24:17.522 --> 01:24:21.064
Do it, you gobs, or it's you
we'll load into the cannons!

1109
01:24:21.148 --> 01:24:22.691
Aye!

1110
01:24:39.543 --> 01:24:40.793
Let go!

1111
01:24:47.385 --> 01:24:49.051
They're club haulin'!

1112
01:24:49.136 --> 01:24:51.886
Hard a port!
Rack the starboard oars!

1113
01:24:51.971 --> 01:24:53.722
Hard a port!

1114
01:25:05.109 --> 01:25:06.360
Keep her steady, man.

1115
01:25:13.409 --> 01:25:14.409
Now!

1116
01:25:14.493 --> 01:25:16.787
Fire!

1117
01:25:26.547 --> 01:25:28.548
Stop blowing holes in my ship!

1118
01:26:15.137 --> 01:26:17.306
We could use a few more ideas, lass!

1119
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:18.973
It's your turn!

1120
01:26:19.016 --> 01:26:20.808
We need us a devil's dowry!

1121
01:26:20.851 --> 01:26:22.184
We'll give them her!

1122
01:26:23.188 --> 01:26:24.687
She's not what they're after.

1123
01:26:27.274 --> 01:26:28.608
The medallion!

1124
01:26:50.713 --> 01:26:53.299
Strike your colors,
you bloomin' cockroaches!

1125
01:26:53.342 --> 01:26:56.094
Hands, grapnels, at the ready!

1126
01:26:56.178 --> 01:26:58.013
Prepare to board!

1127
01:27:05.646 --> 01:27:06.852
Ahh!

1128
01:27:32.339 --> 01:27:35.173
Pistols and cutlasses, men!

1129
01:27:35.216 --> 01:27:37.510
Koehler and Twigg
to the powder magazine!

1130
01:27:37.553 --> 01:27:40.888
And the rest of you,
bring me the medallion!

1131
01:27:50.441 --> 01:27:52.860
Hey! Hey!

1132
01:28:08.668 --> 01:28:11.295
Hey! Below!

1133
01:28:31.106 --> 01:28:32.607
Thanks very much.

1134
01:28:35.943 --> 01:28:37.529
Ha-haa!

1135
01:28:41.909 --> 01:28:44.534
Whoa!

1136
01:28:45.997 --> 01:28:46.996
Jack!

1137
01:28:48.374 --> 01:28:50.165
Bloody empty!

1138
01:29:06.098 --> 01:29:07.976
That's not very nice.

1139
01:29:12.606 --> 01:29:13.814
Where is the medallion?

1140
01:29:13.856 --> 01:29:14.942
Wretch!

1141
01:29:16.693 --> 01:29:17.902
Ah...

1142
01:29:17.986 --> 01:29:19.319
Where is dear William?

1143
01:29:21.531 --> 01:29:22.781
Will!

1144
01:29:24.992 --> 01:29:27.202
- Will!
- Elizabeth!

1145
01:29:30.166 --> 01:29:31.290
Monkey!

1146
01:29:37.965 --> 01:29:39.799
I can't move it!

1147
01:29:41.175 --> 01:29:42.175
Will!

1148
01:29:42.218 --> 01:29:43.344
Elizabeth!

1149
01:29:43.386 --> 01:29:44.469
Will!

1150
01:29:55.566 --> 01:29:57.691
Why, thank you, Jack.

1151
01:29:57.775 --> 01:29:59.401
You're welcome.

1152
01:29:59.485 --> 01:30:02.072
Not you. We named the monkey Jack.

1153
01:30:03.281 --> 01:30:06.199
Gents! Our hope is restored!

1154
01:30:06.284 --> 01:30:07.702
Yeah!

1155
01:30:42.236 --> 01:30:46.239
Any of you so much
as thinks the word parley,

1156
01:30:46.324 --> 01:30:49.075
I'll have your guts for garters!

1157
01:30:56.959 --> 01:30:58.376
Will!

1158
01:30:58.419 --> 01:31:00.420
Stop it! Stop it!

1159
01:31:01.297 --> 01:31:03.255
Welcome back, miss.

1160
01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:06.091
You took advantage of
our hospitality last time.

1161
01:31:06.134 --> 01:31:09.472
It holds fair now
that you return the favor!

1162
01:31:09.890 --> 01:31:12.766
No! No!

1163
01:31:15.436 --> 01:31:16.521
Barbossa!

1164
01:31:18.481 --> 01:31:19.482
Will.

1165
01:31:22.276 --> 01:31:23.276
She goes free!

1166
01:31:24.402 --> 01:31:26.113
What's in your head, boy?

1167
01:31:27.490 --> 01:31:28.782
She goes free.

1168
01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:32.495
You've only got one shot,
and we can't die.

1169
01:31:32.579 --> 01:31:34.579
Don't do anything stupid!

1170
01:31:37.543 --> 01:31:38.792
You can't.

1171
01:31:38.876 --> 01:31:40.292
I can.

1172
01:31:42.005 --> 01:31:43.629
Like that.

1173
01:31:44.676 --> 01:31:45.966
Who are you?

1174
01:31:46.008 --> 01:31:47.510
No one! He's no one!

1175
01:31:48.261 --> 01:31:51.263
A distant cousin of my aunt's
nephew, twice removed.

1176
01:31:51.305 --> 01:31:53.807
- Lovely singing voice, though.
- Eunuch!

1177
01:31:53.849 --> 01:31:55.516
My name is Will Turner!

1178
01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:58.311
My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner.

1179
01:31:58.354 --> 01:32:00.314
His blood runs in my veins.

1180
01:32:01.024 --> 01:32:03.316
It's the spitting image
of ol' Bootstrap Bill,

1181
01:32:03.401 --> 01:32:05.192
come back to haunt us!

1182
01:32:05.277 --> 01:32:07.280
On my word, do as I say,

1183
01:32:07.322 --> 01:32:09.197
or I'll pull this trigger,

1184
01:32:09.282 --> 01:32:11.490
and be lost to Davy Jones' locker!

1185
01:32:12.534 --> 01:32:14.828
Name your terms, Mr. Turner.

1186
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:16.037
Elizabeth goes free!

1187
01:32:16.123 --> 01:32:17.747
Yes, we know that one.

1188
01:32:17.832 --> 01:32:18.832
Anything else?

1189
01:32:21.501 --> 01:32:22.795
And the crew!

1190
01:32:22.838 --> 01:32:24.796
The crew are not to be harmed!

1191
01:32:29.553 --> 01:32:31.343
Agreed.

1192
01:32:37.559 --> 01:32:41.021
Go on, poppet. Walk the plank.

1193
01:32:50.531 --> 01:32:52.199
Barbossa, you lying bastard!

1194
01:32:52.283 --> 01:32:54.868
You swore she'd go free!

1195
01:32:54.952 --> 01:32:57.204
Don't dare impugn me honor, boy!

1196
01:32:57.288 --> 01:32:58.954
I agreed she'd go free.

1197
01:32:59.039 --> 01:33:02.042
It was you who failed to specify
when or where.

1198
01:33:07.757 --> 01:33:11.718
Though it does seem a shame to lose
something so fine, don't it, lads?

1199
01:33:11.761 --> 01:33:12.761
Aye.

1200
01:33:13.763 --> 01:33:16.931
So I'll be havin' that dress
back before you go.

1201
01:33:21.269 --> 01:33:23.397
I always liked you.

1202
01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:28.735
Goes with your black heart!

1203
01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:31.487
Mm. It's still warm.

1204
01:33:34.866 --> 01:33:36.910
Off you go!

1205
01:33:36.993 --> 01:33:38.328
Come on!

1206
01:33:41.957 --> 01:33:43.123
Too long!

1207
01:33:54.261 --> 01:33:56.762
I really rather hoped
we were past all this.

1208
01:33:58.349 --> 01:33:59.765
Jack.

1209
01:33:59.808 --> 01:34:00.893
Jack!

1210
01:34:02.644 --> 01:34:04.104
Did ya not notice?

1211
01:34:04.188 --> 01:34:08.440
That be the same island we made you
governor of on our last little trip.

1212
01:34:09.734 --> 01:34:11.402
I did notice.

1213
01:34:11.444 --> 01:34:15.614
Perhaps you'll be able to conjure up
another miraculous escape,

1214
01:34:15.657 --> 01:34:17.283
but I doubt it.

1215
01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:21.662
Off you go.

1216
01:34:22.664 --> 01:34:25.290
Last time you left me
a pistol with one shot.

1217
01:34:25.375 --> 01:34:26.959
By the powers, you're right!

1218
01:34:27.042 --> 01:34:29.171
Where be Jack's pistol?

1219
01:34:29.255 --> 01:34:30.422
Bring it forward.

1220
01:34:33.592 --> 01:34:36.386
Seeing as there's two of us,
a gentleman...

1221
01:34:37.095 --> 01:34:38.888
...would give us a pair of pistols.

1222
01:34:38.973 --> 01:34:40.681
It'll be one pistol, as before,

1223
01:34:40.765 --> 01:34:43.558
and you can be the gentleman
and shoot the lady,

1224
01:34:43.642 --> 01:34:45.478
and starve to death yourself!

1225
01:35:09.836 --> 01:35:13.380
That's the second time I've had to watch
that man sail away with my ship.

1226
01:35:15.843 --> 01:35:18.510
You were marooned on this island
before, weren't you?

1227
01:35:18.594 --> 01:35:20.180
We can escape the same way!

1228
01:35:20.222 --> 01:35:22.348
To what point and purpose, young missy?

1229
01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:24.850
The Black Pearl is gone,

1230
01:35:24.893 --> 01:35:28.353
and unless you have a rudder and
a lot of sails hidden in that bodice...

1231
01:35:28.438 --> 01:35:30.856
Unlikely...

1232
01:35:30.899 --> 01:35:33.858
Young Mr. Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

1233
01:35:36.529 --> 01:35:38.864
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow!

1234
01:35:38.907 --> 01:35:43.327
You vanished from under the eyes of
seven agents of the East India Company!

1235
01:35:43.369 --> 01:35:46.122
You sacked Nassau Port
without even firing a shot!

1236
01:35:46.207 --> 01:35:48.457
Are you the pirate
I've read about or not?

1237
01:35:51.002 --> 01:35:52.503
How did you escape last time?

1238
01:35:59.344 --> 01:36:01.219
Last time...

1239
01:36:01.261 --> 01:36:04.055
...I was here a grand total
of three days, all right?

1240
01:36:05.058 --> 01:36:06.058
Last time...

1241
01:36:08.102 --> 01:36:11.396
...the rum runners used this island
as a cache.

1242
01:36:11.439 --> 01:36:13.898
They came by and I was able
to barter passage off.

1243
01:36:13.982 --> 01:36:15.735
From the looks of things,

1244
01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:18.028
they've long been out of business.

1245
01:36:18.071 --> 01:36:23.200
You probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.

1246
01:36:23.243 --> 01:36:24.784
So that's it then?

1247
01:36:26.078 --> 01:36:29.915
That's the secret, grand adventure
of the infamous Jack Sparrow!

1248
01:36:30.918 --> 01:36:32.709
You spent three days,

1249
01:36:32.752 --> 01:36:35.087
lying on a beach, drinking rum.

1250
01:36:37.466 --> 01:36:41.259
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

1251
01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:51.477
♪ We're devils
We're black sheep

1252
01:36:51.562 --> 01:36:52.729
♪ We're really bad eggs

1253
01:36:52.772 --> 01:36:55.398
♪ Drink up, me hearties
Yo ho

1254
01:36:55.441 --> 01:36:59.402
♪ Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate's life for me

1255
01:36:59.444 --> 01:37:01.280
I love this song!

1256
01:37:04.283 --> 01:37:06.450
Really bad eggs!

1257
01:37:07.871 --> 01:37:09.872
Ooh...

1258
01:37:11.330 --> 01:37:13.332
When I get the Pearl back,

1259
01:37:13.416 --> 01:37:15.918
I'm gonna teach it to the whole crew,

1260
01:37:15.961 --> 01:37:17.504
and we'll sing it all the time!

1261
01:37:17.589 --> 01:37:21.382
And you will be positively the most
fearsome pirates in the Spanish Main!

1262
01:37:21.466 --> 01:37:23.301
Not just the Spanish Main, love.

1263
01:37:24.345 --> 01:37:26.053
The entire ocean!

1264
01:37:26.138 --> 01:37:27.890
The entire world!

1265
01:37:28.807 --> 01:37:30.808
Wherever we want to go, we go.

1266
01:37:30.851 --> 01:37:32.435
That's what a ship is, you know.

1267
01:37:32.477 --> 01:37:35.314
It's not just a keel and a hull
and a deck and sails.

1268
01:37:35.398 --> 01:37:36.899
That's what a ship needs.

1269
01:37:36.983 --> 01:37:38.984
But what a ship is...

1270
01:37:40.361 --> 01:37:43.321
What the Black Pearl really is...

1271
01:37:44.782 --> 01:37:48.034
...is freedom.

1272
01:37:49.035 --> 01:37:50.120
Jack...

1273
01:37:50.163 --> 01:37:54.917
It must be really terrible for you
to be trapped on this island.

1274
01:37:55.708 --> 01:37:56.919
Oh, yes.

1275
01:37:57.003 --> 01:37:59.839
But the company is...

1276
01:37:59.882 --> 01:38:02.674
...infinitely better than last time,
and the...

1277
01:38:04.468 --> 01:38:08.179
...scenery has definitely improved.
- Mr. Sparrow!

1278
01:38:08.221 --> 01:38:12.267
I'm not entirely sure I've had
enough rum to allow that kind of talk.

1279
01:38:13.894 --> 01:38:15.687
I know exactly what you mean, love.

1280
01:38:23.195 --> 01:38:24.739
To freedom!

1281
01:38:27.491 --> 01:38:29.033
To the Black Pearl.

1282
01:38:45.634 --> 01:38:48.678
Hm?

1283
01:38:58.563 --> 01:38:59.649
No!

1284
01:38:59.733 --> 01:39:02.526
Not good! Stop!

1285
01:39:02.567 --> 01:39:03.776
Not good!

1286
01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:04.860
What are you doing?

1287
01:39:04.903 --> 01:39:06.989
You've burned all the food, the shade...

1288
01:39:07.073 --> 01:39:09.324
...the rum!
- Yes, the rum is gone.

1289
01:39:09.409 --> 01:39:10.657
Why is the rum gone?

1290
01:39:11.117 --> 01:39:12.993
One, because it is a vile drink

1291
01:39:13.077 --> 01:39:15.998
that turns even the most respectable
men into scoundrels.

1292
01:39:16.082 --> 01:39:19.167
Two, that signal
is over 1,000 feet high.

1293
01:39:19.252 --> 01:39:21.460
The entire Royal Navy
is out looking for me.

1294
01:39:21.545 --> 01:39:23.921
Do you think there is even
the slightest chance

1295
01:39:23.964 --> 01:39:25.131
they won't see it?

1296
01:39:25.215 --> 01:39:27.048
But why is the rum gone?

1297
01:39:28.135 --> 01:39:29.593
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.

1298
01:39:29.636 --> 01:39:31.431
You give it one hour, maybe two,

1299
01:39:31.515 --> 01:39:36.433
keep a weather eye open, and you
will see white sails on that horizon.

1300
01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:44.942
"Must've been terrible for you
to be trapped here, Jack."

1301
01:39:44.985 --> 01:39:48.070
"Must've been terrible for you..."
Well, it bloody is now!

1302
01:39:55.453 --> 01:39:57.704
There'll be no
living with her after this.

1303
01:39:58.706 --> 01:40:02.292
- We've got to save Will!
- No! You're safe now.

1304
01:40:02.376 --> 01:40:04.462
We will return to
Port Royal immediately,

1305
01:40:04.546 --> 01:40:06.506
not go gallivanting after pirates!

1306
01:40:06.591 --> 01:40:08.508
Then we condemn him to death!

1307
01:40:09.594 --> 01:40:12.302
The boy's fate is regrettable...

1308
01:40:12.386 --> 01:40:14.972
...but then, so was his decision
to engage in piracy.

1309
01:40:15.057 --> 01:40:18.309
To rescue me! To prevent anything
from happening to me!

1310
01:40:18.393 --> 01:40:22.230
If I may be so bold as to interject
my professional opinion,

1311
01:40:22.315 --> 01:40:25.483
the Pearl was listing
near to scuppers after the battle.

1312
01:40:25.525 --> 01:40:28.443
It's very unlikely she'd be able
to make good time.

1313
01:40:28.486 --> 01:40:29.820
Think about it.

1314
01:40:29.905 --> 01:40:32.114
The Black Pearl.

1315
01:40:32.157 --> 01:40:36.660
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

1316
01:40:36.703 --> 01:40:38.663
How can you pass that up?

1317
01:40:40.832 --> 01:40:43.667
By remembering that I serve others,
Mr. Sparrow,

1318
01:40:43.710 --> 01:40:46.212
- not only myself.
- Commodore, I beg you!

1319
01:40:46.297 --> 01:40:47.295
Please do this!

1320
01:40:47.338 --> 01:40:48.963
For me!

1321
01:40:49.006 --> 01:40:51.175
As a wedding gift.

1322
01:40:51.258 --> 01:40:52.425
Elizabeth?

1323
01:40:53.512 --> 01:40:56.055
Are you accepting
the commodore's proposal?

1324
01:40:58.474 --> 01:40:59.517
I am.

1325
01:41:00.352 --> 01:41:02.019
A wedding! I love weddings!

1326
01:41:02.104 --> 01:41:03.854
Drinks all around!

1327
01:41:06.148 --> 01:41:08.901
I know. "Clap him in irons," right?

1328
01:41:11.447 --> 01:41:12.612
Mr. Sparrow...

1329
01:41:13.949 --> 01:41:16.283
...you will accompany
these fine men to the helm

1330
01:41:16.369 --> 01:41:18.869
and provide us with a bearing
to Isla de Muerta.

1331
01:41:18.912 --> 01:41:22.832
You'll then spend the rest of the voyage
contemplating all possible meanings

1332
01:41:22.874 --> 01:41:25.375
of the phrase "silent as the grave."

1333
01:41:25.417 --> 01:41:27.000
Do I make myself clear?

1334
01:41:27.043 --> 01:41:29.131
Inescapably clear.

1335
01:41:33.135 --> 01:41:35.386
Shiver me timbers!

1336
01:41:36.178 --> 01:41:37.805
Cotton says you missed a bit.

1337
01:41:42.809 --> 01:41:44.185
You knew William Turner?

1338
01:41:46.064 --> 01:41:48.149
Old Bootstrap Bill.

1339
01:41:48.233 --> 01:41:49.233
We knew him.

1340
01:41:50.234 --> 01:41:54.237
Never sat well with Bootstrap,
what we did to Jack Sparrow,

1341
01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:56.365
the mutiny and all.

1342
01:41:56.948 --> 01:41:58.951
He said it wasn't right with the code.

1343
01:42:00.035 --> 01:42:03.205
That's why he sent off a piece
of the treasure to you, as it were.

1344
01:42:03.248 --> 01:42:06.875
He said we deserved to be cursed...

1345
01:42:08.462 --> 01:42:10.546
...and remain cursed.

1346
01:42:10.589 --> 01:42:11.629
Stupid blighter!

1347
01:42:11.714 --> 01:42:13.547
Good man.

1348
01:42:13.591 --> 01:42:18.846
But, as you can imagine, that
didn't sit too well with the captain.

1349
01:42:18.929 --> 01:42:22.183
That didn't sit too well
with the captain at all!

1350
01:42:22.267 --> 01:42:25.894
- Tell him what Barbossa did.
- I'm telling the story!

1351
01:42:28.439 --> 01:42:32.524
So... what the captain did...

1352
01:42:32.609 --> 01:42:35.195
...he strapped a cannon
to Bootstrap's bootstraps.

1353
01:42:35.279 --> 01:42:36.780
Bootstrap's bootstraps.

1354
01:42:36.823 --> 01:42:39.825
Last we saw of ol' Bill Turner...

1355
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:42.368
...he was sinking to
the crushin' black oblivion

1356
01:42:42.453 --> 01:42:45.581
of Davy Jones' locker!

1357
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.083
'Course it was only after that
we learned we needed his blood

1358
01:42:49.126 --> 01:42:50.335
to lift the curse.

1359
01:42:50.419 --> 01:42:53.464
That's what you'd call ironic.

1360
01:42:57.635 --> 01:42:59.261
Bring him!

1361
01:43:06.476 --> 01:43:08.479
I don't care for the situation.

1362
01:43:09.022 --> 01:43:12.106
Any attempt to storm the caves
could turn into an ambush.

1363
01:43:12.149 --> 01:43:15.486
Not if you're the one
doing the ambushing.

1364
01:43:15.570 --> 01:43:19.238
I go in and convince Barbossa to send
his men out in their little boats.

1365
01:43:19.322 --> 01:43:22.158
You and your men
return to the Dauntless

1366
01:43:22.201 --> 01:43:25.454
and blast the bejesus out of them
with your little cannons.

1367
01:43:25.497 --> 01:43:26.746
What do you have to lose?

1368
01:43:27.832 --> 01:43:30.335
Nothing I'd lament being rid of.

1369
01:43:32.002 --> 01:43:33.878
Now, to be quite honest with you,

1370
01:43:33.963 --> 01:43:36.924
there's still a slight risk
to those aboard the Dauntless,

1371
01:43:37.008 --> 01:43:40.802
which includes
the future Mrs. Commodore.

1372
01:43:40.844 --> 01:43:43.930
- It's for your safety!
- Don't care what the Commodore ordered!

1373
01:43:44.015 --> 01:43:45.014
I have to tell him!

1374
01:43:45.057 --> 01:43:48.059
The pirates! They're cursed!
They can't be killed!

1375
01:43:48.143 --> 01:43:50.687
Don't worry, miss.
He's already informed of that.

1376
01:43:50.729 --> 01:43:54.439
A little mermaid flopped up on deck
and told him the whole story!

1377
01:43:54.524 --> 01:43:56.608
This is Jack Sparrow's doing!

1378
01:44:08.081 --> 01:44:09.539
No reason to fret.

1379
01:44:09.623 --> 01:44:12.208
Just a prick of the finger,
a few drops of blood...

1380
01:44:12.251 --> 01:44:14.252
No mistakes this time.

1381
01:44:14.336 --> 01:44:16.045
He's only half Turner.

1382
01:44:16.130 --> 01:44:17.547
We spill it all!

1383
01:44:19.966 --> 01:44:22.885
Guess there is reason to fret.

1384
01:44:35.732 --> 01:44:37.609
Beg your pardon, mate.
Beg your pardon.

1385
01:44:37.694 --> 01:44:39.736
- Begun by blood...
- Excuse me.

1386
01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:42.530
By blood un...

1387
01:44:44.908 --> 01:44:45.907
Jack!

1388
01:44:46.952 --> 01:44:48.034
It's not possible!

1389
01:44:48.076 --> 01:44:50.246
Not probable.

1390
01:44:50.289 --> 01:44:52.082
Where's Elizabeth?

1391
01:44:53.459 --> 01:44:55.709
She's safe, just like I promised.

1392
01:44:55.752 --> 01:44:58.712
She's all set to marry Norrington,
just like she promised,

1393
01:44:58.755 --> 01:45:01.131
and you get to die for her,
just like you promised.

1394
01:45:01.215 --> 01:45:03.342
So we're all men of our word, really.

1395
01:45:03.426 --> 01:45:06.721
Except for Elizabeth,
who is, in fact, a woman.

1396
01:45:06.764 --> 01:45:08.181
Shut up! You're next!

1397
01:45:11.727 --> 01:45:14.604
You don't want to be doing that, mate.

1398
01:45:14.646 --> 01:45:16.605
No, I really think I do.

1399
01:45:18.399 --> 01:45:20.276
Your funeral.

1400
01:45:23.447 --> 01:45:25.447
And why don't I want to be doing it?

1401
01:45:25.490 --> 01:45:27.158
Oh, because...

1402
01:45:28.159 --> 01:45:30.494
Because the HMS Dauntless,

1403
01:45:30.578 --> 01:45:32.996
the pride of the Royal Navy,

1404
01:45:33.081 --> 01:45:36.333
is floating just off shore,

1405
01:45:36.417 --> 01:45:38.251
waiting for you.

1406
01:45:46.303 --> 01:45:47.470
What we doing here?

1407
01:45:49.389 --> 01:45:52.808
The pirates come out,
unprepared and unawares.

1408
01:45:52.850 --> 01:45:54.936
We catch 'em in a crossfire,

1409
01:45:54.978 --> 01:45:57.813
and send 'em down to see Old Hob.

1410
01:45:59.108 --> 01:46:01.484
I know why we're here. I meant...

1411
01:46:01.568 --> 01:46:03.443
...why aren't we doing what it was...

1412
01:46:03.486 --> 01:46:05.319
What Mr. Sparrow said we should do?

1413
01:46:05.362 --> 01:46:06.864
With the cannons and all?

1414
01:46:06.949 --> 01:46:09.991
Because it was Mr. Sparrow who said it.

1415
01:46:12.619 --> 01:46:15.205
You think he wasn't telling the truth?

1416
01:46:15.289 --> 01:46:17.166
Just hear me out, mate.

1417
01:46:17.251 --> 01:46:21.002
You order your men to row out to the
Dauntless, they do what they do best...

1418
01:46:22.089 --> 01:46:26.508
Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your aunt.
There you are with two ships.

1419
01:46:26.592 --> 01:46:29.010
The makings of your very own fleet.

1420
01:46:29.095 --> 01:46:32.682
'Course, you'll take the grandest
as your flagship, and who's to argue?

1421
01:46:32.766 --> 01:46:34.182
But what of the Pearl?

1422
01:46:35.809 --> 01:46:37.145
Name me captain.

1423
01:46:37.187 --> 01:46:40.646
I'll sail under your colors,
I'll give you ten percent of me plunder,

1424
01:46:40.689 --> 01:46:42.898
and you'll get to
introduce yourself as...

1425
01:46:43.483 --> 01:46:46.361
...Commodore Barbossa.

1426
01:46:46.404 --> 01:46:47.487
Savvy?

1427
01:46:47.530 --> 01:46:49.739
I suppose, in exchange, you'll be

1428
01:46:49.823 --> 01:46:52.659
- wanting me not to kill the whelp.
- No. Not at all!

1429
01:46:52.702 --> 01:46:54.369
By all means, kill the whelp!

1430
01:46:54.412 --> 01:46:56.830
Just not yet.

1431
01:46:56.873 --> 01:46:59.041
Wait to lift the curse

1432
01:46:59.083 --> 01:47:01.751
until the opportune moment.

1433
01:47:05.214 --> 01:47:06.841
For instance...

1434
01:47:08.718 --> 01:47:11.970
...after you've killed Norrington's men.

1435
01:47:12.054 --> 01:47:13.638
Every...

1436
01:47:13.723 --> 01:47:15.390
...last...

1437
01:47:15.433 --> 01:47:16.893
...one.

1438
01:47:26.528 --> 01:47:28.862
You've been planning this
from the beginning!

1439
01:47:28.906 --> 01:47:30.489
Ever since you learned my name!

1440
01:47:31.324 --> 01:47:32.323
Yeah.

1441
01:47:34.658 --> 01:47:36.786
I want 50 percent of your plunder.

1442
01:47:36.872 --> 01:47:37.871
- 15!
- 40!

1443
01:47:37.914 --> 01:47:38.915
25!

1444
01:47:40.082 --> 01:47:41.416
And I'll buy you the hat.

1445
01:47:41.459 --> 01:47:43.460
A really big one.

1446
01:47:44.253 --> 01:47:45.421
Commodore.

1447
01:47:48.549 --> 01:47:49.757
We have an accord.

1448
01:47:51.428 --> 01:47:53.720
All hands to the boats!

1449
01:47:54.723 --> 01:47:55.847
Apologies.

1450
01:47:55.932 --> 01:47:57.599
You give the orders.

1451
01:47:58.936 --> 01:47:59.935
Gents...

1452
01:48:00.938 --> 01:48:02.311
...take a walk!

1453
01:48:07.150 --> 01:48:08.485
Not to the boats?

1454
01:49:07.879 --> 01:49:10.797
Hold fire!

1455
01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:15.634
This is just like what
the Greeks done at Troy!

1456
01:49:17.013 --> 01:49:18.638
'Cept they was in a horse,

1457
01:49:18.681 --> 01:49:20.140
instead of dresses.

1458
01:49:20.850 --> 01:49:22.224
Wooden horse.

1459
01:49:35.196 --> 01:49:36.197
A moment, please.

1460
01:49:40.369 --> 01:49:41.367
Elizabeth?

1461
01:49:44.623 --> 01:49:46.415
I just want you to know, I...

1462
01:49:47.542 --> 01:49:50.002
I believe you made a very
good decision today.

1463
01:49:50.836 --> 01:49:52.839
Couldn't be more proud of you!

1464
01:49:53.341 --> 01:49:54.466
But, you know,

1465
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:57.468
even a good decision,
if made for the wrong reasons,

1466
01:49:57.552 --> 01:49:59.054
can be a wrong decision.

1467
01:50:08.065 --> 01:50:09.063
Lieutenant.

1468
01:50:15.987 --> 01:50:18.405
Yoo-hoo.

1469
01:50:28.249 --> 01:50:29.417
Elizabeth?

1470
01:50:31.586 --> 01:50:32.836
Are you there?

1471
01:50:35.089 --> 01:50:37.716
Elizabeth, are you even listening to me?

1472
01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:06.913
Oh, what have you done?

1473
01:51:06.956 --> 01:51:10.541
- Yoo-hoo.
- Stop that! I already feel like a fool!

1474
01:51:11.584 --> 01:51:14.086
Look nice, though.

1475
01:51:17.465 --> 01:51:19.883
Do I look nice now?!

1476
01:51:55.837 --> 01:51:57.087
I must admit, Jack.

1477
01:51:57.172 --> 01:51:59.089
I thought I had you figured.

1478
01:51:59.174 --> 01:52:02.342
But it turns out you're
a hard man to predict.

1479
01:52:02.427 --> 01:52:04.385
Me, I'm dishonest.

1480
01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:07.307
And a dishonest man you can
always trust to be dishonest.

1481
01:52:07.349 --> 01:52:08.599
Honestly...

1482
01:52:08.683 --> 01:52:11.309
...it's the honest ones
you want to watch out for.

1483
01:52:11.351 --> 01:52:13.644
'Cause you can never predict

1484
01:52:13.687 --> 01:52:16.982
when they're going to do
something incredibly...

1485
01:52:17.025 --> 01:52:18.024
...stupid.

1486
01:52:35.667 --> 01:52:36.834
Ha-ha!

1487
01:52:36.877 --> 01:52:37.919
Ha-ha!

1488
01:52:38.003 --> 01:52:39.338
Ha!

1489
01:52:51.184 --> 01:52:53.392
You're off the edge of the map, mate.

1490
01:52:53.477 --> 01:52:55.520
Here, there be monsters!

1491
01:53:03.404 --> 01:53:05.487
What would you pick to eat first?

1492
01:53:05.571 --> 01:53:07.491
I think we should decide now,

1493
01:53:07.575 --> 01:53:09.743
just so we're ready when the time comes!

1494
01:53:34.812 --> 01:53:35.935
What was that?

1495
01:53:40.439 --> 01:53:41.483
Oh.

1496
01:53:54.163 --> 01:53:56.413
Shh!

1497
01:53:58.876 --> 01:53:59.876
It's Elizabeth!

1498
01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:22.149
Make for the ship! Move!

1499
01:54:26.321 --> 01:54:27.736
Ahh!

1500
01:54:31.575 --> 01:54:33.367
To the ship!

1501
01:54:36.164 --> 01:54:39.291
Marines, arms!

1502
01:55:15.744 --> 01:55:17.495
You can't beat me, Jack.

1503
01:55:41.769 --> 01:55:43.312
That's interesting!

1504
01:55:54.198 --> 01:55:56.074
I couldn't resist, mate.

1505
01:56:18.140 --> 01:56:20.391
Oh, no.

1506
01:57:02.475 --> 01:57:03.683
Sorry!

1507
01:57:12.778 --> 01:57:14.445
So, what now, Jack Sparrow?

1508
01:57:14.488 --> 01:57:17.156
Are we to be two immortals,
locked in an epic battle

1509
01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:19.574
until Judgment Day,
when the trumpets sound?

1510
01:57:19.658 --> 01:57:20.658
Hm?

1511
01:57:20.701 --> 01:57:22.119
Or you could surrender.

1512
01:57:30.879 --> 01:57:34.214
Ahh!

1513
01:57:34.298 --> 01:57:36.133
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha.

1514
01:57:49.438 --> 01:57:50.647
All of you with me!

1515
01:57:50.689 --> 01:57:52.774
Will is in that cave,
and we must save him!

1516
01:57:52.858 --> 01:57:55.443
Ready, and... heave!

1517
01:58:02.034 --> 01:58:04.035
Please, I need your help! Come on!

1518
01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:06.871
Any port in a storm.

1519
01:58:06.956 --> 01:58:09.041
Cotton's right. We've got the Pearl!

1520
01:58:09.125 --> 01:58:11.376
What about Jack?
Are you just gonna leave him?

1521
01:58:11.459 --> 01:58:13.253
Jack owes us a ship!

1522
01:58:13.336 --> 01:58:14.880
There's the code to consider.

1523
01:58:15.466 --> 01:58:16.589
The code?

1524
01:58:18.343 --> 01:58:20.801
You're pirates!
Hang the code

1525
01:58:20.885 --> 01:58:22.555
and hang the rules!

1526
01:58:22.597 --> 01:58:25.015
They're more like guidelines, anyway.

1527
01:58:28.811 --> 01:58:30.980
Bloody pirates!

1528
01:58:40.574 --> 01:58:42.322
- Oi!
- What?

1529
01:58:42.407 --> 01:58:44.576
Is it supposed to be doing that?

1530
01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:46.870
They're stealing our ship!

1531
01:58:47.330 --> 01:58:48.996
Bloody pirates!

1532
01:58:51.084 --> 01:58:52.919
Boarders away!

1533
01:59:01.134 --> 01:59:03.135
Come on!

1534
01:59:28.329 --> 01:59:30.370
No! Me eye!

1535
01:59:31.457 --> 01:59:33.165
No!

1536
01:59:47.473 --> 01:59:49.014
Ha!

1537
01:59:50.308 --> 01:59:52.392
I'm gonna teach you the meaning of pain!

1538
01:59:52.477 --> 01:59:54.020
You like pain?

1539
01:59:55.856 --> 01:59:57.232
Try wearing a corset.

1540
02:00:07.617 --> 02:00:09.244
Whose side is Jack on?

1541
02:00:09.328 --> 02:00:12.373
At the moment?

1542
02:00:46.573 --> 02:00:48.448
No fair!

1543
02:01:12.473 --> 02:01:14.308
Ten years you carry that pistol,

1544
02:01:14.392 --> 02:01:16.727
and now you waste your shot!

1545
02:01:17.729 --> 02:01:20.689
He didn't waste it.

1546
02:01:45.340 --> 02:01:46.841
I feel...

1547
02:01:51.430 --> 02:01:52.722
...cold.

1548
02:02:22.835 --> 02:02:25.838
Oh... Ugh! Oh!

1549
02:02:54.991 --> 02:02:57.451
Parley?

1550
02:02:57.494 --> 02:02:59.372
The ship is ours, gentlemen.

1551
02:02:59.456 --> 02:03:01.833
Huzzah! Huzzah!

1552
02:03:10.633 --> 02:03:13.511
Huzzah!

1553
02:03:47.711 --> 02:03:50.046
We should return to the Dauntless.

1554
02:03:52.593 --> 02:03:56.219
Your fiancé will be wanting
to know you're safe.

1555
02:04:05.898 --> 02:04:09.191
If you were waiting for
the opportune moment...

1556
02:04:10.192 --> 02:04:11.526
...that was it.

1557
02:04:12.986 --> 02:04:15.155
Now if you'd be so kind,
I'd be much obliged

1558
02:04:15.239 --> 02:04:18.074
if you'd drop me off at my ship.

1559
02:04:22.663 --> 02:04:24.831
I'm sorry, Jack.

1560
02:04:26.751 --> 02:04:28.959
They done what's right by them.

1561
02:04:29.044 --> 02:04:30.796
Can't expect more than that.

1562
02:04:46.395 --> 02:04:47.728
Jack Sparrow!

1563
02:04:47.771 --> 02:04:51.858
- We have learned that you...
- Captain! Captain Jack Sparrow.

1564
02:04:52.568 --> 02:04:55.820
...For your willful commission
of crimes against the crown.

1565
02:04:55.904 --> 02:04:59.616
Said crimes being numerous in quantity,

1566
02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:01.242
and sinister in nature.

1567
02:05:01.911 --> 02:05:03.410
The most egregious of these

1568
02:05:03.453 --> 02:05:05.664
to be cited herewith:

1569
02:05:05.749 --> 02:05:09.500
- Piracy, smuggling...
- This is wrong.

1570
02:05:10.502 --> 02:05:13.504
Commodore Norrington
is bound by the law,

1571
02:05:13.588 --> 02:05:16.131
as are we all.

1572
02:05:16.174 --> 02:05:18.884
...Impersonating an officer
of the Spanish Royal Navy,

1573
02:05:18.969 --> 02:05:22.055
impersonating a cleric
of the Church of England...

1574
02:05:22.139 --> 02:05:23.263
Oh, yes!

1575
02:05:23.305 --> 02:05:25.307
Sailing under false colors,

1576
02:05:25.392 --> 02:05:29.603
arson, kidnapping, looting, poaching,

1577
02:05:29.647 --> 02:05:35.609
brigandage, pilfering,
depravity, depredation,

1578
02:05:35.652 --> 02:05:37.445
and general lawlessness.

1579
02:05:38.862 --> 02:05:40.532
And for these crimes,

1580
02:05:40.616 --> 02:05:43.158
you have been sentenced to be,
on this day,

1581
02:05:43.202 --> 02:05:46.955
hung by the neck, until dead.

1582
02:05:46.998 --> 02:05:49.291
May God have mercy on your soul.

1583
02:05:49.333 --> 02:05:50.874
Governor Swann.

1584
02:05:50.959 --> 02:05:52.878
Commodore.

1585
02:05:54.379 --> 02:05:55.379
Elizabeth.

1586
02:05:56.840 --> 02:05:59.676
I should've told you every day,
from the moment I met you.

1587
02:06:02.470 --> 02:06:04.013
I love you.

1588
02:06:18.570 --> 02:06:20.322
Oi, watch yourself!

1589
02:06:20.364 --> 02:06:21.489
Marines!

1590
02:06:21.532 --> 02:06:23.073
I can't breathe!

1591
02:06:24.869 --> 02:06:25.908
Elizabeth!

1592
02:06:28.997 --> 02:06:30.040
Move!

1593
02:06:30.915 --> 02:06:33.207
Goodness sake!

1594
02:06:40.925 --> 02:06:43.134
You men! With me!

1595
02:06:54.397 --> 02:06:55.564
Move!

1596
02:07:05.324 --> 02:07:06.909
Come on!

1597
02:07:17.004 --> 02:07:18.127
Come on, men!

1598
02:07:43.739 --> 02:07:47.740
I thought we might have to endure some
manner of ill-conceived escape attempt.

1599
02:07:48.576 --> 02:07:50.159
But not from you.

1600
02:07:50.244 --> 02:07:54.081
On our return to Port Royal,
I granted you clemency.

1601
02:07:54.124 --> 02:07:55.790
And this is how you thank me?

1602
02:07:55.833 --> 02:07:57.917
By throwing in your lot with him?

1603
02:07:57.960 --> 02:07:59.544
He's a pirate!

1604
02:07:59.629 --> 02:08:01.589
And a good man.

1605
02:08:02.381 --> 02:08:04.633
If all I've achieved here
is that the hangman

1606
02:08:04.676 --> 02:08:06.802
will own two pairs
of boots instead of one,

1607
02:08:06.886 --> 02:08:08.512
so be it.

1608
02:08:08.596 --> 02:08:10.472
At least my conscience will be clear.

1609
02:08:10.515 --> 02:08:13.476
You forget your place, Turner.

1610
02:08:15.018 --> 02:08:16.645
It's right here,

1611
02:08:16.688 --> 02:08:18.147
between you and Jack.

1612
02:08:22.153 --> 02:08:23.819
As is mine.

1613
02:08:23.903 --> 02:08:25.278
Elizabeth!

1614
02:08:26.740 --> 02:08:27.904
Lower your weapons.

1615
02:08:28.700 --> 02:08:30.700
For goodness sake, put them down!

1616
02:08:35.791 --> 02:08:38.710
So this is where
your heart truly lies, then.

1617
02:08:40.335 --> 02:08:41.837
It is.

1618
02:08:50.344 --> 02:08:53.974
Well! I'm actually feeling
rather good about this.

1619
02:08:54.017 --> 02:08:56.559
I think we've all arrived
at a very special place, eh?

1620
02:08:56.643 --> 02:08:57.936
- Oh.
- Spiritually.

1621
02:08:58.020 --> 02:09:00.021
Ecumenically.

1622
02:09:00.106 --> 02:09:02.190
Grammatically.

1623
02:09:02.774 --> 02:09:05.358
I want you to know that
I was rooting for you, mate.

1624
02:09:06.654 --> 02:09:07.654
Know that.

1625
02:09:11.659 --> 02:09:13.160
Elizabeth.

1626
02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:17.705
It would never have worked
between us, darling.

1627
02:09:19.166 --> 02:09:21.043
I'm sorry.

1628
02:09:23.171 --> 02:09:24.171
Will!

1629
02:09:26.466 --> 02:09:28.133
Nice hat.

1630
02:09:30.094 --> 02:09:31.677
Friends!

1631
02:09:33.597 --> 02:09:36.391
This the day that you will always

1632
02:09:36.434 --> 02:09:39.061
remember as the day that...

1633
02:09:44.025 --> 02:09:46.692
Idiot! He's nowhere to go
but back to the noose!

1634
02:09:49.113 --> 02:09:50.948
Sail ho!

1635
02:09:58.499 --> 02:10:01.125
What's your plan of action?

1636
02:10:01.875 --> 02:10:02.875
Sir?

1637
02:10:07.257 --> 02:10:09.714
Perhaps on the rare occasion

1638
02:10:09.757 --> 02:10:13.637
pursuing the right course
demands an act of piracy,

1639
02:10:13.721 --> 02:10:17.516
piracy itself can be the right course?

1640
02:10:21.770 --> 02:10:23.063
Mr. Turner!

1641
02:10:29.153 --> 02:10:31.988
I will accept the consequences
of my actions.

1642
02:10:37.953 --> 02:10:39.579
This is a beautiful sword.

1643
02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:43.791
I would expect the man who made it

1644
02:10:43.834 --> 02:10:48.630
to show the same care and devotion
in every aspect of his life.

1645
02:10:50.674 --> 02:10:52.426
Thank you.

1646
02:10:55.304 --> 02:10:56.344
Commodore!

1647
02:10:56.429 --> 02:10:58.140
What about Sparrow?

1648
02:11:00.057 --> 02:11:02.976
Oh, I think we can afford
to give him one day's head start.

1649
02:11:09.483 --> 02:11:11.153
So...

1650
02:11:12.236 --> 02:11:15.323
This is the path you've chosen, is it?

1651
02:11:16.699 --> 02:11:18.991
After all...

1652
02:11:19.034 --> 02:11:20.579
...he is a blacksmith.

1653
02:11:21.580 --> 02:11:22.831
No.

1654
02:11:27.544 --> 02:11:29.838
He's a pirate.

1655
02:11:54.862 --> 02:11:56.529
Heave!

1656
02:12:06.082 --> 02:12:08.667
Thought you were supposed
to keep to the code, eh?

1657
02:12:08.709 --> 02:12:11.378
We figured they were more actual...

1658
02:12:11.462 --> 02:12:13.422
...guidelines.

1659
02:12:17.552 --> 02:12:19.261
Thank you.

1660
02:12:20.388 --> 02:12:21.764
Captain Sparrow.

1661
02:12:26.060 --> 02:12:27.644
The Black Pearl is yours!

1662
02:12:43.452 --> 02:12:45.079
On deck, you scabrous dogs!

1663
02:12:45.163 --> 02:12:46.831
Hands to braces!

1664
02:12:46.915 --> 02:12:48.999
Let go and haul to run free.

1665
02:12:50.669 --> 02:12:52.461
Now...

1666
02:12:52.546 --> 02:12:54.380
Bring me that horizon.
