Subtitling made
possible by Acorn Media

2
00:01:09.857 --> 00:01:12.019
Blast.

3
00:01:13.694 --> 00:01:15.094
Godfrey!

4
00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:27.165
Godfrey!

5
00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:30.409
Very sorry, sir. The
power seems to be out.

6
00:01:30.477 --> 00:01:31.809
Yes, that's evident.

7
00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:32.903
Dreadful night.

8
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:33.913
Indeed.

9
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:35.813
That will be all, Godfrey.

10
00:01:35.883 --> 00:01:37.283
Of course, sir.

11
00:01:48.162 --> 00:01:49.892
Damn it.

12
00:01:58.038 --> 00:02:00.337
Oh, it can't be. Timothy?

13
00:02:00.407 --> 00:02:02.342
Oh, dear God. Please don't.

14
00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.969
I'm sorry. I'm so
very sorry, Timothy.

15
00:02:05.045 --> 00:02:06.741
Timothy!

16
00:02:33.207 --> 00:02:34.402
William.

17
00:02:34.475 --> 00:02:35.636
Hello.

18
00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.372
I came to see that
you were all right.

19
00:02:38.445 --> 00:02:40.641
The electricity is
out everywhere.

20
00:02:40.714 --> 00:02:42.046
It's only darkness, William.

21
00:02:42.116 --> 00:02:43.414
It's quite lovely, actually.

22
00:02:43.484 --> 00:02:45.851
We never get to see
the city like this anymore.

23
00:02:47.554 --> 00:02:49.523
How was your day?

24
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.991
Fine.

25
00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:53.425
And?

26
00:02:53.494 --> 00:02:56.658
It was fine. And yours?

27
00:02:58.565 --> 00:03:01.228
Also fine.

28
00:03:11.078 --> 00:03:12.011
Sir.

29
00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.672
Doctor.

30
00:03:13.747 --> 00:03:15.079
Rotten old night out there.

31
00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:17.084
The rain's got the
sewer backed up.

32
00:03:17.151 --> 00:03:19.518
There's rats as big as
pumpkins roaming the street.

33
00:03:19.586 --> 00:03:21.646
What brings you here, George?

34
00:03:21.722 --> 00:03:24.715
Uh, sir, there's been
a suspicious death

35
00:03:24.792 --> 00:03:26.090
at Beaton Manor.

36
00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:39.472
Well, Chauncey
Beaton's neck was broken.

37
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.099
In two places it feels like.

38
00:03:41.175 --> 00:03:44.543
It appears he fell
from that window.

39
00:03:44.611 --> 00:03:46.102
Well, that would do it.

40
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.876
Was it accidental, then?

41
00:03:47.948 --> 00:03:49.814
Or was it suicide?

42
00:03:49.883 --> 00:03:51.044
Or was he pushed?

43
00:03:51.118 --> 00:03:53.110
I'll tell you what killed
him. It was this house.

44
00:03:53.187 --> 00:03:54.985
What do you mean, ma'am?

45
00:03:55.055 --> 00:03:56.387
Claire.

46
00:03:56.457 --> 00:03:58.926
I'll say it aloud. What
we've all said in whispers.

47
00:03:58.992 --> 00:04:00.483
That house is cursed.

48
00:04:00.561 --> 00:04:02.621
That house killed
Master Chauncey.

49
00:04:07.434 --> 00:04:09.562
What do you mean the
house killed him, ma'am?

50
00:04:09.636 --> 00:04:11.070
I mean it as I say it.

51
00:04:11.138 --> 00:04:12.902
It is cursed by voodoo.

52
00:04:12.973 --> 00:04:14.066
Bad magic.

53
00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:15.165
Very bad.

54
00:04:15.242 --> 00:04:16.835
That's enough, Claire.
Please go inside.

55
00:04:20.247 --> 00:04:23.376
You'll have to excuse her.
She's very superstitious.

56
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.577
And you are?

57
00:04:24.651 --> 00:04:25.584
William Godfrey.

58
00:04:25.652 --> 00:04:28.087
The butler. I found the body.

59
00:04:28.155 --> 00:04:30.886
Mr. Godfrey put
the call in to us, sir.

60
00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:31.958
Ah, yes.

61
00:04:31.992 --> 00:04:34.154
You mentioned you thought
the death was suspicious.

62
00:04:34.228 --> 00:04:35.161
What did you mean?

63
00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:36.229
I don't know.

64
00:04:36.296 --> 00:04:38.060
I thought I saw something.

65
00:04:38.132 --> 00:04:39.409
It may have been
a trick of the mind.

66
00:04:39.433 --> 00:04:40.833
What did you see?

67
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:44.668
As I was standing over
Master Chauncey's body,

68
00:04:44.738 --> 00:04:48.675
I thought I saw someone
standing in that window.

69
00:04:48.742 --> 00:04:50.836
Oh, my lord, sir.

70
00:04:50.911 --> 00:04:51.935
He's still there!

71
00:04:52.012 --> 00:04:53.605
George!

72
00:05:00.687 --> 00:05:03.179
Detective Murdoch,
Toronto Constabulary.

73
00:05:03.257 --> 00:05:04.384
Identify yourself.

74
00:05:04.458 --> 00:05:06.393
Ronald Beaton.

75
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.453
Brother of the deceased.

76
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.195
I take it he is... deceased.

77
00:05:14.268 --> 00:05:16.760
I'm sorry for your
loss, Mr. Beaton,

78
00:05:16.837 --> 00:05:18.863
but where were you at
the time of the incident?

79
00:05:20.274 --> 00:05:21.503
Strange question.

80
00:05:21.575 --> 00:05:24.306
I had assumed
Chauncey killed himself.

81
00:05:24.378 --> 00:05:26.074
Why assume that?

82
00:05:26.146 --> 00:05:27.944
Suicide runs in the family.

83
00:05:28.015 --> 00:05:30.780
Please, sir. Your whereabouts.

84
00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:34.379
I was asleep in my room.

85
00:05:34.454 --> 00:05:35.581
Can anyone vouch for this?

86
00:05:36.757 --> 00:05:40.592
I didn't push my brother
out a window, Detective.

87
00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:43.426
The exertion would
have killed me first.

88
00:05:43.497 --> 00:05:44.497
How so?

89
00:05:44.565 --> 00:05:46.466
I have a bad heart.

90
00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:47.967
Two attacks already.

91
00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:51.005
The doctors say the
next will be my last.

92
00:05:51.071 --> 00:05:55.702
What do the, um,
staff say it was?

93
00:05:55.776 --> 00:05:57.745
They believe the
house is cursed.

94
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:03.109
It's not the house.

95
00:06:03.183 --> 00:06:05.584
This whole family is cursed.

96
00:06:05.652 --> 00:06:08.417
Sir, we've had reports of...

97
00:06:08.488 --> 00:06:09.421
Oh, look at that.

98
00:06:09.489 --> 00:06:11.424
Uh, several witnesses
report hearing shouting

99
00:06:11.491 --> 00:06:13.084
just before the
victim fell, sir.

100
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.890
Ah.

101
00:06:14.962 --> 00:06:17.090
Well, that must have
been what awakened me.

102
00:06:18.732 --> 00:06:21.702
George, gather all
the staff and residents

103
00:06:21.768 --> 00:06:23.202
in the drawing room.

104
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.466
Sir.

105
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.080
Who heard shouting

106
00:06:34.114 --> 00:06:36.447
in the moments before
Chauncey Beaton fell?

107
00:06:39.353 --> 00:06:40.878
And who was shouting?

108
00:06:40.954 --> 00:06:42.183
Master Chauncey.

109
00:06:42.256 --> 00:06:43.485
What was he saying?

110
00:06:43.557 --> 00:06:45.423
He was shouting
Master Timothy's name.

111
00:06:45.492 --> 00:06:47.324
That would be our half-brother.

112
00:06:47.394 --> 00:06:49.386
And where is he?

113
00:06:49.463 --> 00:06:51.830
In that jar on the mantel.

114
00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:53.458
His ashes.

115
00:06:53.533 --> 00:06:55.968
He killed himself last February.

116
00:06:56.036 --> 00:06:58.335
Oh, yes. I believe
that was in the papers.

117
00:06:58.405 --> 00:07:00.601
My condolences.

118
00:07:00.674 --> 00:07:03.974
There are just two of us now.

119
00:07:04.044 --> 00:07:05.842
- Yourself and...
- Byron.

120
00:07:05.913 --> 00:07:07.142
My husband.

121
00:07:07.214 --> 00:07:09.649
He should be home shortly.

122
00:07:09.716 --> 00:07:12.117
Why would your brother Chauncey

123
00:07:12.185 --> 00:07:15.246
be shouting your
dead brother's name?

124
00:07:15.322 --> 00:07:17.757
Perhaps he felt guilty.

125
00:07:17.824 --> 00:07:19.122
Guilty for what?

126
00:07:23.363 --> 00:07:25.229
Byron, it's awful.

127
00:07:25.299 --> 00:07:29.031
So it's true, then.
Chauncey's dead?

128
00:07:29.102 --> 00:07:31.196
This is Detective Murdoch.

129
00:07:31.271 --> 00:07:32.534
A detective?

130
00:07:32.606 --> 00:07:34.666
I'm sorry to ask
at this time, sir,

131
00:07:34.741 --> 00:07:37.040
but where were you
this evening at 8:00?

132
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.136
On my way to meet a
business acquaintance.

133
00:07:39.212 --> 00:07:40.874
They can confirm this?

134
00:07:40.948 --> 00:07:42.507
Actually, no.

135
00:07:42.582 --> 00:07:44.483
He never arrived.

136
00:07:44.551 --> 00:07:46.110
Not surprising
on a night like this.

137
00:07:48.221 --> 00:07:50.486
You're not suggesting
that I had anything to do...

138
00:07:50.557 --> 00:07:52.526
For God sakes,
man, it was a suicide.

139
00:07:52.592 --> 00:07:53.855
Who told you that?

140
00:07:56.129 --> 00:07:57.129
I just assumed.

141
00:07:57.197 --> 00:07:58.825
It's the curse.

142
00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:00.390
Who said that?

143
00:08:00.467 --> 00:08:02.527
The next person
to breathe that word

144
00:08:02.602 --> 00:08:04.127
will be on a boat back to Haiti.

145
00:08:04.204 --> 00:08:05.228
Is that understood?

146
00:08:06.473 --> 00:08:09.409
No more of this mumbo
jumbo about voodoo and ghosts.

147
00:08:11.078 --> 00:08:12.078
If you'll excuse me,

148
00:08:12.145 --> 00:08:14.273
I have to change out
of these damp clothes.

149
00:08:14.348 --> 00:08:15.839
A word, Mr. Beaton.

150
00:08:15.916 --> 00:08:19.250
George, I want statements
from everyone here, please.

151
00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:20.719
Sir.

152
00:08:25.792 --> 00:08:29.695
My apologies for that
outburst, Detective.

153
00:08:29.763 --> 00:08:33.962
These people cling to
the same superstitions

154
00:08:34.034 --> 00:08:36.833
their ancestors
brought from Africa.

155
00:08:40.273 --> 00:08:42.333
It's a bloody disgrace.

156
00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:44.310
Sir, why would you assume

157
00:08:44.378 --> 00:08:47.280
that your brother
committed suicide?

158
00:08:47.347 --> 00:08:51.011
Chauncey was a troubled soul.

159
00:08:51.084 --> 00:08:52.950
Was his soul troubled

160
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.548
by the suicide of
your brother Timothy?

161
00:08:56.623 --> 00:08:59.787
Chauncey was heard
yelling Timothy's name

162
00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.694
shortly before he
fell to his death.

163
00:09:02.763 --> 00:09:04.595
Ah, yes.

164
00:09:04.664 --> 00:09:06.565
Chauncey never got over it.

165
00:09:06.633 --> 00:09:07.862
None of us have.

166
00:09:07.934 --> 00:09:08.958
My poor wife.

167
00:09:09.036 --> 00:09:11.801
She found Timothy's
body in the pool, you know.

168
00:09:11.872 --> 00:09:13.238
We were all devastated.

169
00:09:13.306 --> 00:09:17.141
Did Chauncey feel guilt
over Timothy's death?

170
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.008
I suppose we all did.

171
00:09:19.079 --> 00:09:23.414
Before Timothy did himself
in, he wrote letters to each of us

172
00:09:23.483 --> 00:09:26.180
detailing the wrongs
we'd committed

173
00:09:26.253 --> 00:09:28.245
against him and his mother.

174
00:09:29.656 --> 00:09:30.715
Are these...

175
00:09:30.791 --> 00:09:32.760
Death masks, yes.

176
00:09:32.826 --> 00:09:34.294
A Beaton tradition.

177
00:09:34.361 --> 00:09:36.592
Death becomes us, you might say.

178
00:09:36.663 --> 00:09:38.359
I see.

179
00:09:39.533 --> 00:09:42.332
And what of these wrongs
that Timothy wrote about?

180
00:09:42.402 --> 00:09:43.961
Did you ever meet Timothy?

181
00:09:44.037 --> 00:09:45.061
No.

182
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.074
This was his final portrait.

183
00:09:53.146 --> 00:09:56.310
Yes, he was a mulatto.

184
00:09:56.383 --> 00:09:57.817
After our mother died,

185
00:09:57.884 --> 00:10:01.218
Father took up with a
member of the household staff.

186
00:10:01.288 --> 00:10:05.282
Ah, and Timothy was
the product of that union.

187
00:10:05.358 --> 00:10:07.122
My brothers and
I didn't take well

188
00:10:07.194 --> 00:10:09.356
to having a brown
bastard sharing our name,

189
00:10:09.429 --> 00:10:10.453
as you might imagine.

190
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.159
Why would I imagine that, sir?

191
00:10:13.233 --> 00:10:15.259
We treated him rather badly.

192
00:10:15.335 --> 00:10:17.361
His mother, too, I'm afraid.

193
00:10:17.437 --> 00:10:18.564
And where is she?

194
00:10:18.638 --> 00:10:20.937
Chanté died last
year of pneumonia.

195
00:10:21.007 --> 00:10:23.033
Timothy blamed me for that.

196
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:27.013
Apparently, the doctor I
brought in was inadequate.

197
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.209
And what wrongs had
Chauncey committed?

198
00:10:30.283 --> 00:10:33.742
They'd quarreled the
night before he died.

199
00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.949
His last words to
Timothy were harsh.

200
00:10:37.023 --> 00:10:39.288
I know Chauncey
felt terrible about it.

201
00:10:39.359 --> 00:10:41.453
Enough for Chauncey
to take his own life?

202
00:10:41.528 --> 00:10:46.694
Perhaps something about these
walls drives men to madness.

203
00:10:48.235 --> 00:10:49.669
That's rubbish!

204
00:10:49.736 --> 00:10:51.637
You're telling me that
this Chauncey fellow

205
00:10:51.705 --> 00:10:53.571
calls his brother
Timothy a few names,

206
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.041
then feels so bad that he
throws himself out of a window?

207
00:10:56.109 --> 00:10:57.839
Sir, Timothy Beaton
did kill himself.

208
00:10:57.911 --> 00:10:59.607
Possibly as a
result of that quarrel.

209
00:10:59.679 --> 00:11:01.705
Perhaps it was too much
for Chauncey to bear.

210
00:11:01.781 --> 00:11:03.249
Six months later?

211
00:11:03.316 --> 00:11:05.148
I understand regrets, Murdoch.

212
00:11:05.218 --> 00:11:07.016
I've had a few myself, but...

213
00:11:07.087 --> 00:11:09.022
I agree it seems
somewhat unlikely.

214
00:11:09.089 --> 00:11:13.151
But Chauncey was heard
calling Timothy's name as he fell.

215
00:11:13.226 --> 00:11:15.559
Perhaps he was announcing
his imminent arrival

216
00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:16.562
in the afterlife.

217
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.531
I don't know, but
perhaps there is something

218
00:11:18.598 --> 00:11:19.598
to this curse business.

219
00:11:19.633 --> 00:11:20.657
Curse?

220
00:11:20.734 --> 00:11:23.727
Yes, Beaton Manor
is said to be cursed.

221
00:11:23.803 --> 00:11:26.398
Oh, well, that's it, then.
Good work, Crabtree.

222
00:11:26.473 --> 00:11:28.339
A curse. Of course. Bloody hell.

223
00:11:28.408 --> 00:11:30.570
Clearly, we need to know
more about this family.

224
00:11:30.644 --> 00:11:33.079
George, find out everything
you can about the Beatons.

225
00:11:33.146 --> 00:11:34.079
Right away, sir.

226
00:11:34.147 --> 00:11:35.843
And the curse as well.

227
00:11:35.916 --> 00:11:37.782
But that's not to be
your focus, George.

228
00:11:37.851 --> 00:11:39.649
Sir.

229
00:11:39.719 --> 00:11:41.745
You're just encouraging
him, you know.

230
00:11:41.821 --> 00:11:45.155
Superstition has been used
to cover up murder in the past.

231
00:11:45.225 --> 00:11:47.387
Perhaps someone
is doing that now.

232
00:11:50.263 --> 00:11:53.062
Chauncey Beaton's skull
was shattered in the fall,

233
00:11:53.133 --> 00:11:54.795
and his neck was indeed broken.

234
00:11:54.868 --> 00:11:56.393
He could have died on impact.

235
00:11:56.469 --> 00:11:58.199
Could have?

236
00:11:58.271 --> 00:12:00.740
It wasn't necessarily
the fall that killed him.

237
00:12:00.807 --> 00:12:05.211
In the seconds before, he
suffered a massive heart attack.

238
00:12:05.946 --> 00:12:07.881
But to fall out a window.

239
00:12:07.948 --> 00:12:09.712
Surely, a heart attack
would have dropped him

240
00:12:09.783 --> 00:12:10.783
right there on the floor.

241
00:12:10.817 --> 00:12:14.049
Yes, unlikely he'd think to
step onto a window ledge.

242
00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.053
Point taken.

243
00:12:15.121 --> 00:12:17.522
Any idea what could
cause a heart attack

244
00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:19.389
in a man barely 30 years of age?

245
00:12:19.459 --> 00:12:21.325
A number of things, really.

246
00:12:21.394 --> 00:12:24.421
Birth defect, weak
arteries, extreme shock.

247
00:12:24.497 --> 00:12:27.626
Like an attack by an
assailant intent on murder.

248
00:12:27.701 --> 00:12:29.693
Perhaps.

249
00:12:30.837 --> 00:12:33.272
Did you know them
at all? The Beatons?

250
00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.672
Not well.

251
00:12:34.741 --> 00:12:37.609
I met Timothy on a
number of social occasions.

252
00:12:37.677 --> 00:12:38.610
Sweet man.

253
00:12:38.678 --> 00:12:40.237
But tormented, I sensed.

254
00:12:40.313 --> 00:12:42.407
You're aware he
committed suicide.

255
00:12:42.482 --> 00:12:43.482
Yes.

256
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:44.813
Do you have any idea why?

257
00:12:44.884 --> 00:12:46.876
It was rumored that
the woman he loved

258
00:12:46.953 --> 00:12:48.353
married one of his brothers.

259
00:12:48.421 --> 00:12:51.914
Byron, I believe.

260
00:12:51.992 --> 00:12:53.654
What have you learned, George?

261
00:12:53.727 --> 00:12:55.218
Quite a lot, actually, sir.

262
00:12:55.295 --> 00:12:56.695
Would you like to
ask me questions,

263
00:12:56.763 --> 00:12:58.391
or shall I regale you?

264
00:12:58.465 --> 00:13:01.230
I sense you're in
a regaling mood.

265
00:13:01.301 --> 00:13:03.327
You would be correct, so...

266
00:13:03.403 --> 00:13:05.235
The Beatons are
not actually Beatons.

267
00:13:05.305 --> 00:13:07.171
Their original family
name was Bitton.

268
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.209
- French.
- Then Haitian.

269
00:13:09.276 --> 00:13:12.906
They held large plantations in
what was then St. Dominique.

270
00:13:12.979 --> 00:13:15.778
They fled during the
slave rebellion in 1791

271
00:13:15.849 --> 00:13:17.374
but couldn't go back to France

272
00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:20.010
because they were still
lopping off heads there,

273
00:13:20.086 --> 00:13:21.315
so they came to Canada.

274
00:13:21.388 --> 00:13:23.032
I understand they made
their fortune in rubber trees?

275
00:13:23.056 --> 00:13:23.989
That's right, sir.

276
00:13:24.057 --> 00:13:25.923
They purchased large
holdings in the Congo

277
00:13:25.992 --> 00:13:27.153
just before the rubber boom.

278
00:13:27.227 --> 00:13:28.786
Not so cursed after all.

279
00:13:28.862 --> 00:13:31.229
Oh, sir, I believe
they're cursed.

280
00:13:31.298 --> 00:13:33.767
Over the last century,
only a single Beaton man

281
00:13:33.833 --> 00:13:35.825
has ever survived
past the age of 50.

282
00:13:35.902 --> 00:13:38.462
Really? How did they die?

283
00:13:38.538 --> 00:13:41.269
Seven sudden deaths.
Probably heart attacks.

284
00:13:41.341 --> 00:13:43.936
Five suicides and
three accidental deaths,

285
00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.104
two of which involved a horse...

286
00:13:46.179 --> 00:13:47.841
or horses.

287
00:13:47.914 --> 00:13:50.247
If that's not cursed,
I don't know what is.

288
00:13:50.317 --> 00:13:52.650
I suspect this curse is
nothing more than bad luck

289
00:13:52.719 --> 00:13:55.712
coupled with the melancholy
of having too much money

290
00:13:55.789 --> 00:13:57.121
and too little purpose.

291
00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:59.022
Who was the one lucky survivor?

292
00:13:59.092 --> 00:14:02.153
Henry Beaton, the
father of the four brothers.

293
00:14:02.228 --> 00:14:05.960
He died at the age of 60
three years ago from a...

294
00:14:06.032 --> 00:14:07.091
Heart attack.

295
00:14:07.167 --> 00:14:08.567
Most likely, sir.

296
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:11.665
Does it strike you as odd

297
00:14:11.738 --> 00:14:13.900
that the brothers all
lived at Beaton Manor?

298
00:14:13.973 --> 00:14:15.100
Odd indeed, sir.

299
00:14:15.175 --> 00:14:16.234
Peculiar even.

300
00:14:21.915 --> 00:14:23.008
What have we here?

301
00:14:23.083 --> 00:14:25.450
I would have spoken
to you last night.

302
00:14:25.518 --> 00:14:26.451
I meant to,

303
00:14:26.519 --> 00:14:29.512
but after Master Byron's
outburst, I felt that...

304
00:14:29.589 --> 00:14:31.683
Say what you came
to say, Mr. Godfrey.

305
00:14:31.758 --> 00:14:35.024
Well, how does
one say such a thing

306
00:14:35.095 --> 00:14:37.530
without being judged insane?

307
00:14:37.597 --> 00:14:40.260
I promise no such judgment.

308
00:14:42.569 --> 00:14:45.038
Over the last two weeks,

309
00:14:45.105 --> 00:14:48.234
my niece Claire and
other members of my staff

310
00:14:48.308 --> 00:14:50.777
have reported
seeing an apparition

311
00:14:50.844 --> 00:14:53.814
wandering through the
halls of Beaton Manor.

312
00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.880
A ghost?

313
00:14:56.249 --> 00:14:58.684
I dismissed this, of course.

314
00:14:58.752 --> 00:15:01.881
Until last night,
after you left,

315
00:15:01.955 --> 00:15:03.548
I saw him myself.

316
00:15:03.623 --> 00:15:06.752
It was the man I'd seen
in the tower window

317
00:15:06.826 --> 00:15:09.261
just after Master Chauncey died.

318
00:15:09.329 --> 00:15:11.889
Did you recognize this man?

319
00:15:15.001 --> 00:15:17.937
As God is my witness, sir,

320
00:15:18.004 --> 00:15:19.802
it was Timothy Beaton.

321
00:15:24.844 --> 00:15:25.937
Who here believes

322
00:15:26.012 --> 00:15:27.640
they've seen the ghost
of Timothy Beaton?

323
00:15:29.883 --> 00:15:31.476
No one?

324
00:15:31.551 --> 00:15:35.249
You can all rest assured that
no matter what you say here,

325
00:15:35.321 --> 00:15:36.619
your jobs are safe.

326
00:15:36.689 --> 00:15:38.658
Isn't that right, Mr. Beaton?

327
00:15:38.725 --> 00:15:39.658
Yes, of course.

328
00:15:39.726 --> 00:15:41.490
So I'll ask again.

329
00:15:41.561 --> 00:15:44.656
Who here has seen this ghost?

330
00:15:46.232 --> 00:15:47.962
Last week in the east wing.

331
00:15:48.034 --> 00:15:49.468
He had on the
clothes he was wearing

332
00:15:49.536 --> 00:15:50.936
when they pulled
him from the pool.

333
00:15:51.004 --> 00:15:53.940
We've heard footsteps, too.

334
00:15:54.007 --> 00:15:55.703
But there's never anybody there.

335
00:15:55.775 --> 00:15:57.471
This is absurd.

336
00:15:57.544 --> 00:15:58.944
Ghosts don't exist.

337
00:15:59.012 --> 00:16:00.947
How do you know that, Byron?

338
00:16:01.014 --> 00:16:05.145
Don't souls arise
from their bodies?

339
00:16:05.218 --> 00:16:06.258
They don't linger, Ronald.

340
00:16:06.286 --> 00:16:07.286
Maybe some do.

341
00:16:07.353 --> 00:16:10.346
The tormented souls
with unfinished business,

342
00:16:10.423 --> 00:16:12.392
like vengeance for wrongs done.

343
00:16:12.459 --> 00:16:14.485
You've been drinking.

344
00:16:14.561 --> 00:16:15.893
With good reason.

345
00:16:15.962 --> 00:16:18.955
Did we not deny
Timothy his blood right?

346
00:16:19.032 --> 00:16:20.609
Did we not hound his
mother to an early grave?

347
00:16:20.633 --> 00:16:21.532
Not in front of the staff.

348
00:16:21.601 --> 00:16:23.467
Did you not steal the
only woman he ever loved

349
00:16:23.536 --> 00:16:25.027
and drive him to
take his own life?

350
00:16:28.274 --> 00:16:29.902
- How dare you?
- Gentlemen.

351
00:16:31.511 --> 00:16:34.413
If I were Timothy, I'd
find my way back to us

352
00:16:34.481 --> 00:16:37.041
if I had to pass
through hell to do it.

353
00:16:37.116 --> 00:16:40.086
George, I want a
record of every sighting.

354
00:16:40.153 --> 00:16:42.452
Who, what, where, and when.

355
00:16:42.522 --> 00:16:43.820
Sir.

356
00:16:59.873 --> 00:17:02.433
Mrs. Beaton.

357
00:17:04.344 --> 00:17:06.336
Thank you.

358
00:17:08.081 --> 00:17:11.051
I understand you were
once courted by Timothy.

359
00:17:15.021 --> 00:17:18.890
Everything Ronald said is true.

360
00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:21.518
Timothy killed
himself because of me.

361
00:17:21.594 --> 00:17:23.722
You can't possibly know that.

362
00:17:23.796 --> 00:17:24.855
No?

363
00:17:24.931 --> 00:17:29.164
He wrote a letter the day
he died telling me as much.

364
00:17:32.272 --> 00:17:34.104
I searched for him.

365
00:17:34.173 --> 00:17:37.075
I was frantic.

366
00:17:37.143 --> 00:17:41.843
Yes. Your husband
mentioned you found the body.

367
00:17:42.615 --> 00:17:45.744
Timothy was at the
bottom of the courtyard pool.

368
00:17:45.818 --> 00:17:49.220
He'd tied a sack of
rocks about his waist.

369
00:17:49.289 --> 00:17:53.852
He'd had to smash through
the ice with a sledgehammer

370
00:17:53.927 --> 00:17:54.927
to do it.

371
00:17:54.961 --> 00:17:57.726
Mrs. Beaton, if you don't mind,

372
00:17:57.797 --> 00:17:59.925
who signed Timothy's
death certificate?

373
00:18:01.601 --> 00:18:02.728
Dr. Gladsford?

374
00:18:02.802 --> 00:18:04.896
He's highly reputable, William.

375
00:18:04.971 --> 00:18:06.064
I was just wondering

376
00:18:06.139 --> 00:18:08.574
if he may have been
hasty in his conclusions.

377
00:18:08.641 --> 00:18:11.668
You think Timothy
Beaton is still alive?

378
00:18:11.744 --> 00:18:13.645
I'm asking if it's possible.

379
00:18:13.713 --> 00:18:16.114
It would explain why
people keep seeing him.

380
00:18:16.182 --> 00:18:19.311
Unless he really is a ghost.

381
00:18:19.385 --> 00:18:20.978
Julia.

382
00:18:21.054 --> 00:18:23.421
William.

383
00:18:25.291 --> 00:18:27.624
I have Dr. Gladsford's
report here.

384
00:18:27.694 --> 00:18:30.163
If you wouldn't mind.

385
00:18:31.664 --> 00:18:34.133
Well, there were no vital signs.

386
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.762
No heartbeat or breathing.
His skin was cold to the touch.

387
00:18:37.837 --> 00:18:39.829
These observations
were taken a full hour

388
00:18:39.906 --> 00:18:41.875
after Timothy was
pulled from the water.

389
00:18:41.941 --> 00:18:43.102
I wouldn't call this hasty.

390
00:18:43.176 --> 00:18:46.112
So, the report is unassailable?

391
00:18:46.179 --> 00:18:48.546
Given these facts, I would
have drawn the same conclusion.

392
00:18:48.615 --> 00:18:51.312
Timothy Beaton is dead, William.

393
00:18:51.384 --> 00:18:54.786
Whatever's stalking the
halls of the manor, it isn't him.

394
00:18:56.356 --> 00:18:57.551
So, you're from Haiti, then?

395
00:18:57.624 --> 00:18:59.217
No.

396
00:18:59.292 --> 00:19:01.784
Master Timothy
used to take us there.

397
00:19:01.861 --> 00:19:04.387
He said it was our
family's true home.

398
00:19:04.464 --> 00:19:05.464
Family?

399
00:19:05.498 --> 00:19:09.060
So, you and
Timothy were related?

400
00:19:09.135 --> 00:19:12.128
Well, he was my
cousin's son, you know.

401
00:19:12.205 --> 00:19:14.333
Her name was Chanté.

402
00:19:14.407 --> 00:19:16.740
Ma'am, forgive me for asking,

403
00:19:16.809 --> 00:19:18.778
but if the Beaton family

404
00:19:18.845 --> 00:19:21.246
mistreated Timothy
and your cousin,

405
00:19:21.314 --> 00:19:22.646
why did you stay on?

406
00:19:22.715 --> 00:19:28.677
Well, despite everything,
they loved the manor house.

407
00:19:28.755 --> 00:19:30.519
It's where they belonged.

408
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:32.889
It's where I belong.

409
00:19:32.959 --> 00:19:36.487
So, someone's been impersonating
Timothy Beaton's ghost.

410
00:19:36.562 --> 00:19:38.588
There's no other
explanation, sir.

411
00:19:38.665 --> 00:19:40.327
Pardon me, sirs, but there is.

412
00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.733
Perhaps it's time to
consider the unthinkable.

413
00:19:42.802 --> 00:19:45.738
That Timothy Beaton's ghost
is wandering Beaton Manor.

414
00:19:45.805 --> 00:19:47.239
I know how that sounds,

415
00:19:47.306 --> 00:19:50.208
but what do we really
know about the afterlife?

416
00:19:50.276 --> 00:19:52.871
People say there's a heaven,
but nobody's ever seen it.

417
00:19:52.945 --> 00:19:56.177
People have seen ghosts
and not just at Beaton Manor.

418
00:19:56.249 --> 00:19:58.514
My Aunt Primrose saw the
ghost of my Uncle Percy...

419
00:19:58.584 --> 00:20:00.553
Not your bloody aunts again.

420
00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.715
The constabulary will not
go chasing after goblins.

421
00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:04.849
Not goblins, sir.

422
00:20:04.924 --> 00:20:07.155
Goblins are small
gnomish creatures

423
00:20:07.226 --> 00:20:08.626
that dwell deep within...

424
00:20:08.695 --> 00:20:10.323
Whatever our
beliefs or disbeliefs,

425
00:20:10.396 --> 00:20:12.058
something happened
at Beaton Manor.

426
00:20:12.131 --> 00:20:13.409
Now, George, you've made
a list of the occurrences?

427
00:20:13.433 --> 00:20:14.433
Sir.

428
00:20:16.069 --> 00:20:17.469
Sightings in red.

429
00:20:17.537 --> 00:20:21.633
Audible events, footsteps
and whatnot, marked in blue.

430
00:20:21.708 --> 00:20:23.734
Each numbered in
chronological order,

431
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:25.403
beginning with November the 8th.

432
00:20:25.478 --> 00:20:27.322
- This all started 10 days ago.
- Yes.

433
00:20:27.346 --> 00:20:28.370
Always at night.

434
00:20:28.448 --> 00:20:30.815
Usually between
midnight and 3:00 a.m.

435
00:20:30.883 --> 00:20:31.816
Nine incidents.

436
00:20:31.884 --> 00:20:33.546
That's one per night.

437
00:20:33.619 --> 00:20:34.552
Right.

438
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.465
We're going to be spending
the night at the manor.

439
00:20:36.489 --> 00:20:37.923
Sir?

440
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:40.960
If there is a ghost, I want
it haunting my jail cell.

441
00:20:41.027 --> 00:20:43.155
Understand?

442
00:20:45.665 --> 00:20:47.998
You'll be fine, George.

443
00:20:48.067 --> 00:20:50.832
I appreciate that you're
conducting an investigation,

444
00:20:50.903 --> 00:20:52.132
Detective,

445
00:20:52.205 --> 00:20:53.696
but the hour is late.

446
00:20:53.773 --> 00:20:56.106
Both of the masters of
the house are asleep.

447
00:20:56.175 --> 00:20:58.303
It's not our intention
to disturb them.

448
00:20:58.377 --> 00:20:59.845
Very well, then.

449
00:20:59.912 --> 00:21:01.540
I'll be in the
servants' quarters

450
00:21:01.614 --> 00:21:02.741
if you require anything.

451
00:21:02.815 --> 00:21:04.477
- Thank you.
- Good night.

452
00:21:08.287 --> 00:21:09.482
Right, then, George.

453
00:21:09.555 --> 00:21:11.023
You and Higgins
take the east wing.

454
00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:12.888
The inspector and I
will take the west wing,

455
00:21:12.959 --> 00:21:15.121
and we'll reconvene
here in the morning.

456
00:21:15.194 --> 00:21:16.594
And keep the chat down.

457
00:21:16.662 --> 00:21:17.873
We don't want to
scare the ghost away.

458
00:21:17.897 --> 00:21:20.457
Oh, sir, I suspect the
reverse is more likely.

459
00:21:20.533 --> 00:21:22.593
Just get to it, Crabtree.

460
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:25.831
He's still watching us.

461
00:21:25.905 --> 00:21:27.806
Yes.

462
00:21:28.674 --> 00:21:30.734
It's quite unnerving.

463
00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.439
Six months after
my Uncle Percy died,

464
00:21:33.513 --> 00:21:35.448
my Aunt Primrose
awoke to find him standing

465
00:21:35.515 --> 00:21:36.539
at the foot of the bed.

466
00:21:36.616 --> 00:21:38.050
Maybe she was still dreaming.

467
00:21:38.117 --> 00:21:40.746
I once awoke to find a group
of dwarves staring down at me,

468
00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.083
and I was terrified.

469
00:21:42.155 --> 00:21:45.125
I must admit I find them
a bit unnerving myself.

470
00:21:45.191 --> 00:21:46.625
Anyways, once I awoke fully,

471
00:21:46.692 --> 00:21:49.161
I realized it was nothing
but piles of clothing

472
00:21:49.228 --> 00:21:50.161
I'd strewn about.

473
00:21:50.229 --> 00:21:52.198
I appreciate your
point, Higgins,

474
00:21:52.265 --> 00:21:53.790
but my aunt wasn't dreaming.

475
00:21:53.866 --> 00:21:55.357
When Uncle Percy turned around,

476
00:21:55.434 --> 00:21:57.699
she saw a slit down
the middle of his jacket.

477
00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:58.703
So?

478
00:21:58.771 --> 00:22:01.297
So, it turns out my Uncle
Percy had put on a few pounds

479
00:22:01.374 --> 00:22:02.307
before he died.

480
00:22:02.375 --> 00:22:05.709
The undertaker had to cut
his jacket to fit him into it.

481
00:22:05.778 --> 00:22:07.542
The thing is, my
aunt didn't know that.

482
00:22:07.613 --> 00:22:09.639
Really?

483
00:22:09.715 --> 00:22:10.808
God's truth.

484
00:22:10.883 --> 00:22:12.681
That is spooky.

485
00:22:12.752 --> 00:22:13.811
If you want spooky,

486
00:22:13.886 --> 00:22:16.321
I've been reading about
this Haitian voodoo.

487
00:22:16.389 --> 00:22:18.358
They have creatures
called zombies.

488
00:22:18.424 --> 00:22:19.687
They're the living dead.

489
00:22:19.759 --> 00:22:22.752
How can they be alive and dead?

490
00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.572
What is it, sir?

491
00:22:36.642 --> 00:22:39.077
I hear footsteps.

492
00:22:41.447 --> 00:22:44.713
They're coming from up ahead.

493
00:22:49.455 --> 00:22:52.857
Whoever it was must have
gone into one of these rooms.

494
00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:05.463
Empty.

495
00:23:05.538 --> 00:23:06.972
The same.

496
00:23:07.039 --> 00:23:09.304
Bloody hell. Maybe
there is a ghost.

497
00:23:09.375 --> 00:23:11.207
Sir, you don't really
believe that, do you?

498
00:23:11.277 --> 00:23:12.802
I grew up near the
Yorkshire moors.

499
00:23:12.879 --> 00:23:14.142
There's more ghosts than sheep.

500
00:23:14.213 --> 00:23:16.307
I don't believe
in ghosts per se.

501
00:23:16.382 --> 00:23:18.112
But who's to say what goes on?

502
00:23:18.184 --> 00:23:19.982
The George Crabtree philosophy.

503
00:23:20.052 --> 00:23:21.281
Very funny, Murdoch.

504
00:23:22.955 --> 00:23:25.117
More footsteps, sir.

505
00:23:25.191 --> 00:23:28.355
Coming from behind us.

506
00:23:29.795 --> 00:23:31.991
Mr. Godfrey.

507
00:23:32.064 --> 00:23:33.828
I'm going to bed shortly.

508
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.391
Is there anything you require?

509
00:23:35.468 --> 00:23:37.528
No, thank you, Mr. Godfrey.

510
00:23:37.603 --> 00:23:38.662
Good night.

511
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.540
- Did you just shiver?
- Yes.

512
00:23:49.615 --> 00:23:51.311
They say that when
you shiver suddenly,

513
00:23:51.384 --> 00:23:53.182
it means a ghost just
passed through you.

514
00:23:53.252 --> 00:23:56.051
How do they know that?

515
00:23:56.122 --> 00:23:59.149
I don't know.

516
00:23:59.225 --> 00:24:01.888
Sounds speculative.

517
00:24:01.961 --> 00:24:04.453
Perhaps.

518
00:24:11.437 --> 00:24:12.905
What was that?

519
00:24:12.972 --> 00:24:14.600
It came from...

520
00:24:15.775 --> 00:24:18.506
This is the room
Chauncey Beaton fell from.

521
00:24:19.211 --> 00:24:20.211
Who's there?

522
00:24:20.246 --> 00:24:22.147
Show yourself!

523
00:24:25.084 --> 00:24:27.110
It was just a cat, Crabtree.

524
00:24:27.186 --> 00:24:30.918
In Haiti, black cats have a
certain dark magic about them.

525
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:32.788
Mojo, I believe it's called.

526
00:24:32.858 --> 00:24:33.791
Mojo.

527
00:24:33.859 --> 00:24:36.385
I don't like the sound of that.

528
00:24:36.462 --> 00:24:37.395
Oh, that's nothing.

529
00:24:37.463 --> 00:24:39.455
They have these dolls
that you stick pins into...

530
00:24:42.134 --> 00:24:45.070
What's with these windows?

531
00:24:49.141 --> 00:24:51.542
That's him. That's the ghost.

532
00:24:55.147 --> 00:24:56.171
There he goes.

533
00:25:00.152 --> 00:25:01.984
Where'd he go?

534
00:25:03.756 --> 00:25:06.658
Higgins, fetch
Detective Murdoch.

535
00:25:07.893 --> 00:25:09.953
By myself, George?

536
00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:11.861
Just go, Henry.

537
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:20.330
This ghost impersonator escaped
out the window, right, Murdoch?

538
00:25:20.406 --> 00:25:22.534
Oh, sir, it's three
stories straight down.

539
00:25:22.608 --> 00:25:24.668
A man doesn't simply
disappear, George.

540
00:25:24.744 --> 00:25:26.508
Yes, but if it's not a man, sir.

541
00:25:26.579 --> 00:25:30.414
Sirs, perhaps he went
into his death mask.

542
00:25:30.483 --> 00:25:31.593
Perhaps you're right, Higgins.

543
00:25:31.617 --> 00:25:33.128
Perhaps this is
where his soul resides.

544
00:25:33.152 --> 00:25:34.450
Aah!

545
00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.853
Bloody hell, it's back there.

546
00:25:36.922 --> 00:25:38.481
You two stay here.

547
00:25:38.557 --> 00:25:40.389
And keep an eye open.

548
00:25:46.365 --> 00:25:48.163
Well?

549
00:25:48.234 --> 00:25:50.794
He's dead, sir.

550
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:52.429
Oh, Murdoch.

551
00:25:52.505 --> 00:25:56.067
What in God's name is
going on in this house?

552
00:26:00.479 --> 00:26:03.108
How did this happen?
Right under our very noses?

553
00:26:03.182 --> 00:26:05.174
Sir, we don't know
what happened.

554
00:26:05.251 --> 00:26:07.880
For all we know, Ronald
Beaton died of natural causes.

555
00:26:07.953 --> 00:26:09.649
You don't believe that, do you?

556
00:26:09.722 --> 00:26:10.849
I can't say that I do, sir.

557
00:26:10.923 --> 00:26:11.923
Right.

558
00:26:11.991 --> 00:26:13.721
- Theories?
- Facts, sir.

559
00:26:13.793 --> 00:26:15.523
Three of the four
Beaton brothers have died

560
00:26:15.594 --> 00:26:16.671
within the last six months.

561
00:26:16.695 --> 00:26:17.906
Two within the last three days.

562
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:19.421
All heirs to a fortune,

563
00:26:19.498 --> 00:26:21.660
with just one
brother left standing.

564
00:26:21.734 --> 00:26:23.600
Let's get Byron Beaton in.

565
00:26:23.669 --> 00:26:25.331
Yes, sir.

566
00:26:27.006 --> 00:26:28.133
Who is that, sir?

567
00:26:28.207 --> 00:26:29.800
The Beaton family lawyer.

568
00:26:29.875 --> 00:26:31.503
I thought I'd have a chat.

569
00:26:31.577 --> 00:26:33.443
Ah, very good.

570
00:26:33.512 --> 00:26:35.003
It's an unusual will

571
00:26:35.081 --> 00:26:37.915
in that the estate
in its entirety

572
00:26:37.983 --> 00:26:40.714
was passed down to all four sons

573
00:26:40.786 --> 00:26:43.119
in the form of a joint tenancy.

574
00:26:43.189 --> 00:26:44.122
What's that?

575
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.716
Well, Inspector,

576
00:26:46.792 --> 00:26:50.752
it's a form of estate
common to married couples.

577
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:52.196
Upon the death of one,

578
00:26:52.264 --> 00:26:54.665
it automatically
passes to the other.

579
00:26:54.733 --> 00:26:57.635
Except in this case it passes
to the surviving brothers.

580
00:26:57.703 --> 00:26:59.604
Very good.

581
00:26:59.672 --> 00:27:01.766
Why would old man
Beaton do it like that?

582
00:27:01.841 --> 00:27:03.469
Two reasons.

583
00:27:03.542 --> 00:27:05.033
One is Beaton Manor itself.

584
00:27:05.111 --> 00:27:08.775
The house and the property
alone are worth close to $60,000.

585
00:27:08.848 --> 00:27:11.443
And that's not
counting the furnishings.

586
00:27:11.517 --> 00:27:12.517
Right.

587
00:27:12.585 --> 00:27:15.020
You can't divide up
a property like that.

588
00:27:15.087 --> 00:27:16.749
Well, you could if you sold it,

589
00:27:16.822 --> 00:27:19.291
but then it would no
longer be Beaton Manor,

590
00:27:19.358 --> 00:27:20.792
would it, Inspector?

591
00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.056
I suppose not, Mr. Aylmer.

592
00:27:23.129 --> 00:27:25.325
What's the second reason?

593
00:27:25.397 --> 00:27:26.888
There was a concern,

594
00:27:26.966 --> 00:27:29.561
expressed by
one of the siblings,

595
00:27:29.635 --> 00:27:31.297
that the youngest son,

596
00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:34.135
the, um the mulatto...

597
00:27:34.206 --> 00:27:35.071
Timothy.

598
00:27:35.141 --> 00:27:39.078
That Timothy intended
to bequeath his portion

599
00:27:39.145 --> 00:27:41.011
to the household servants.

600
00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.744
Which might be fine if
he were the last to survive,

601
00:27:44.817 --> 00:27:48.652
but I trust you can see
the implications if he wasn't.

602
00:27:48.721 --> 00:27:50.019
I'll do my best.

603
00:27:50.089 --> 00:27:53.287
Which brother
expressed this concern?

604
00:27:53.359 --> 00:27:55.828
The eldest, Byron.

605
00:27:55.895 --> 00:27:58.126
You're aware
you stand to inherit

606
00:27:58.197 --> 00:27:59.529
the entire Beaton fortune?

607
00:27:59.598 --> 00:28:01.658
Of course I'm aware.
I'm not an idiot.

608
00:28:01.734 --> 00:28:03.032
And wasn't it at your urging

609
00:28:03.102 --> 00:28:05.571
that the estate be
bequeathed as a joint tenancy?

610
00:28:05.638 --> 00:28:07.106
That was to prevent Timothy

611
00:28:07.173 --> 00:28:09.506
from making a mockery
of the Beaton name.

612
00:28:09.575 --> 00:28:11.567
He despised us.

613
00:28:11.644 --> 00:28:14.204
Even his suicide
was an act of hatred.

614
00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.681
I'm not convinced
it was a suicide.

615
00:28:16.749 --> 00:28:17.682
I beg your pardon?

616
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:20.242
Anyone could have tied
the weights around his waist,

617
00:28:20.319 --> 00:28:22.447
broken through the ice.

618
00:28:22.521 --> 00:28:24.251
For all I know, he
was dead already.

619
00:28:25.858 --> 00:28:27.383
You're suggesting
I killed Timothy?

620
00:28:27.459 --> 00:28:28.392
No.

621
00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:31.624
No, I'm suggesting you
killed all three of your brothers.

622
00:28:31.697 --> 00:28:34.963
One by one.

623
00:28:35.034 --> 00:28:36.866
I'm sorry.

624
00:28:36.936 --> 00:28:40.930
This line of questioning is
too offensive to continue.

625
00:28:41.006 --> 00:28:43.305
You have no alibi for
Chauncey's murder.

626
00:28:43.375 --> 00:28:45.139
What about Ronald's death?

627
00:28:45.211 --> 00:28:46.941
I was sleeping in my bed.

628
00:28:47.012 --> 00:28:47.945
Ah.

629
00:28:48.013 --> 00:28:49.982
I assume your wife
can attest to this?

630
00:28:51.417 --> 00:28:53.045
No, I'm afraid I can't.

631
00:28:53.118 --> 00:28:55.713
Last night, we went
to sleep together,

632
00:28:55.788 --> 00:28:59.088
but he snores.

633
00:28:59.158 --> 00:29:02.492
I asked him to sleep in
the guest room next to ours.

634
00:29:02.561 --> 00:29:06.089
But I can assure you he was
in that room when Ronald died.

635
00:29:06.165 --> 00:29:07.793
How can you be certain?

636
00:29:07.866 --> 00:29:10.563
When I awoke to
Ronald's screams,

637
00:29:10.636 --> 00:29:13.504
I went into the
hall to investigate.

638
00:29:13.572 --> 00:29:15.507
Byron's door was still locked.

639
00:29:15.574 --> 00:29:17.543
He didn't come out
into the hall as well?

640
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.636
He sleeps soundly.

641
00:29:19.712 --> 00:29:22.181
But he did emerge when
Godfrey pounded on the door

642
00:29:22.248 --> 00:29:23.181
to awaken him.

643
00:29:23.249 --> 00:29:27.243
You say you awoke to the
sound of Ronald screaming.

644
00:29:27.319 --> 00:29:29.185
That's right.

645
00:29:29.255 --> 00:29:31.281
From the time you
heard the screams

646
00:29:31.357 --> 00:29:33.485
to the time you
exited into the hall,

647
00:29:33.559 --> 00:29:35.027
how much time had elapsed?

648
00:29:36.729 --> 00:29:38.925
Two minutes at the most.

649
00:29:38.998 --> 00:29:41.934
In two minutes, Byron
would have had to travel

650
00:29:42.001 --> 00:29:43.765
from where he
was in the west wing

651
00:29:43.836 --> 00:29:45.930
all the way to the
room that he slept in

652
00:29:46.005 --> 00:29:47.029
on the second floor.

653
00:29:47.106 --> 00:29:48.106
I've paced it out.

654
00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:49.417
How long did it take you?

655
00:29:49.441 --> 00:29:50.500
Just under a minute.

656
00:29:50.576 --> 00:29:53.102
Our boy could have covered
that distance in half the time

657
00:29:53.178 --> 00:29:54.840
if he'd put a bit
of sauce into it.

658
00:29:54.913 --> 00:29:56.153
What if he encountered someone?

659
00:29:56.181 --> 00:29:57.261
People heard Ronald scream.

660
00:29:57.316 --> 00:29:58.807
They were coming
out of their rooms.

661
00:29:58.884 --> 00:30:00.284
Yes, that is a problem.

662
00:30:00.352 --> 00:30:02.116
But it is possible, in theory.

663
00:30:02.187 --> 00:30:04.053
Sir, surely the ghost
was instrumental

664
00:30:04.123 --> 00:30:05.182
in Mr. Beaton's death.

665
00:30:05.257 --> 00:30:06.452
It was, George.

666
00:30:06.525 --> 00:30:07.525
What?

667
00:30:07.559 --> 00:30:08.686
But the ghost was Timothy.

668
00:30:08.761 --> 00:30:10.957
I saw it. It looked right at me.

669
00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:13.431
I believe the ghost was Byron.

670
00:30:13.499 --> 00:30:17.129
And I intend to
demonstrate how he did it.

671
00:31:04.283 --> 00:31:05.216
William.

672
00:31:05.284 --> 00:31:06.946
Come in, come in.

673
00:31:07.019 --> 00:31:09.181
I see you've completed the mold.

674
00:31:09.254 --> 00:31:10.950
Latex rubber, you say?

675
00:31:11.023 --> 00:31:11.956
Yes.

676
00:31:12.024 --> 00:31:14.550
Recent additives have
made it pliable and strong.

677
00:31:14.626 --> 00:31:16.492
The process would
have been familiar

678
00:31:16.562 --> 00:31:18.531
to a rubber magnate
like Byron Beaton.

679
00:31:18.597 --> 00:31:19.530
Speaking of,

680
00:31:19.598 --> 00:31:22.625
I've completed the
postmortem on young Ronald.

681
00:31:22.701 --> 00:31:23.896
Heart attack?

682
00:31:23.969 --> 00:31:27.133
Massive. Almost
goes without saying.

683
00:31:29.708 --> 00:31:32.075
Very good, William.

684
00:31:34.346 --> 00:31:38.249
You'll need to shade in
the eyebrows and so forth.

685
00:31:38.317 --> 00:31:39.250
And color the skin.

686
00:31:39.318 --> 00:31:40.318
Yes.

687
00:31:40.352 --> 00:31:43.845
I'll need to cut holes
for the eyes and nostrils.

688
00:31:43.922 --> 00:31:45.049
Wouldn't there be a gap

689
00:31:45.124 --> 00:31:47.593
between the the mask and
the skin around the eyes?

690
00:31:47.659 --> 00:31:51.653
I believe that Byron
glued the mask to his face.

691
00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:53.665
Try it on.

692
00:31:53.732 --> 00:31:55.132
Oh, I...

693
00:31:56.735 --> 00:31:59.136
Well, all right.

694
00:32:02.441 --> 00:32:05.172
Oh, William. You are a sport.

695
00:32:06.078 --> 00:32:08.172
By the way, there's
a lecture tonight

696
00:32:08.247 --> 00:32:10.011
on the Michelson-Morley
experiment.

697
00:32:10.082 --> 00:32:11.015
7:00.

698
00:32:11.083 --> 00:32:13.177
Ah, yes, I'd love to, but...

699
00:32:13.252 --> 00:32:14.276
Yes, I know.

700
00:32:14.353 --> 00:32:17.653
It's last minute, but
I'll drop by anyway.

701
00:32:17.723 --> 00:32:18.763
If you're free, we can go.

702
00:32:18.824 --> 00:32:20.168
Murdoch, I've been thinking.

703
00:32:20.192 --> 00:32:22.161
Oh, bloody hell!

704
00:32:22.227 --> 00:32:23.251
Good God, man.

705
00:32:23.328 --> 00:32:24.819
That's quite effective.

706
00:32:24.897 --> 00:32:27.025
Is this how Byron did it, then?

707
00:32:27.099 --> 00:32:28.192
Yes.

708
00:32:28.267 --> 00:32:30.293
Well, the mask would
need a few more details,

709
00:32:30.369 --> 00:32:31.369
but I believe so, yes.

710
00:32:31.437 --> 00:32:33.872
All you have to do
now is find that mask.

711
00:32:35.607 --> 00:32:37.075
Is this absolutely necessary?

712
00:32:37.142 --> 00:32:39.270
I'm afraid it is, Mr. Godfrey.

713
00:32:39.344 --> 00:32:40.778
Stop this.

714
00:32:40.846 --> 00:32:41.870
Stop this now!

715
00:32:41.947 --> 00:32:44.178
Not until we find
what we're looking for.

716
00:32:44.249 --> 00:32:45.877
By whose authority?

717
00:32:48.187 --> 00:32:49.849
We've found nothing, sir.

718
00:32:49.922 --> 00:32:51.857
I'll have your badge, Murdoch.

719
00:32:51.924 --> 00:32:52.857
Ah, yes.

720
00:32:52.925 --> 00:32:55.394
Just give me a
moment, Mr. Beaton.

721
00:32:57.629 --> 00:32:59.825
You've checked
everywhere, George?

722
00:32:59.898 --> 00:33:02.197
Sir. Floor to
ceiling. Wall to wall.

723
00:33:02.267 --> 00:33:04.395
Then it must be
behind the walls.

724
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:05.403
Behind, sir?

725
00:33:05.471 --> 00:33:07.030
Think, George.

726
00:33:07.105 --> 00:33:09.472
This so-called ghost
that you followed,

727
00:33:09.541 --> 00:33:11.100
he didn't simply disappear.

728
00:33:11.176 --> 00:33:14.078
He had to have some
means of escaping undetected.

729
00:33:14.146 --> 00:33:16.206
Isn't that right, Mr. Beaton?

730
00:33:16.281 --> 00:33:18.341
I don't know what
you're talking about.

731
00:33:18.417 --> 00:33:20.028
There are secret passageways
throughout this house,

732
00:33:20.052 --> 00:33:21.213
are there not?

733
00:33:22.988 --> 00:33:24.581
Fine. George, please
fetch a crowbar.

734
00:33:24.656 --> 00:33:26.648
I won't have you
destroying my house!

735
00:33:26.725 --> 00:33:29.820
Then tell me where the
entrance to the passageway is.

736
00:34:10.235 --> 00:34:13.467
George, fetch the
lanterns, please.

737
00:34:20.312 --> 00:34:21.610
After you, Mr. Godfrey.

738
00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.115
Sir?

739
00:34:24.182 --> 00:34:26.811
Go ahead.

740
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.132
Do these passageways go
throughout the whole house?

741
00:34:31.156 --> 00:34:32.488
Yes.

742
00:34:32.558 --> 00:34:35.551
Emery Beaton and his
family escaped with their lives

743
00:34:35.627 --> 00:34:38.392
through secret passageways
built in their house

744
00:34:38.463 --> 00:34:41.433
during the slave
rebellions in St. Dominique.

745
00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.765
Advantageous to
have a ready escape

746
00:34:43.835 --> 00:34:45.997
in the event your slaves
rise up against you.

747
00:34:46.071 --> 00:34:47.004
Sir, this must be

748
00:34:47.072 --> 00:34:49.564
where the footfalls you
heard last night came from.

749
00:34:49.641 --> 00:34:52.008
Yes, George, I believe
we heard Byron on his way

750
00:34:52.077 --> 00:34:54.512
to make his ghostly
appearance to you and Henry.

751
00:34:56.515 --> 00:34:59.644
I'm sure you're mistaken, sir.

752
00:35:01.219 --> 00:35:03.984
Careful, here. Some of
these boards are loose.

753
00:35:10.095 --> 00:35:12.030
George.

754
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:33.883
Sir, that must be the
mask the killer used.

755
00:35:33.952 --> 00:35:35.545
Yes, George.

756
00:35:35.621 --> 00:35:37.715
Arrest Byron Beaton.

757
00:35:45.163 --> 00:35:46.603
What are you thinking, sir?

758
00:35:50.235 --> 00:35:52.329
This is a quality piece of work.

759
00:35:52.404 --> 00:35:53.463
Very detailed.

760
00:35:53.538 --> 00:35:55.564
They've even sewn the eyebrows.

761
00:35:55.641 --> 00:35:57.837
What did they use for
the eyes? Stained glass?

762
00:35:57.909 --> 00:35:59.571
Easier to see
through, I suppose.

763
00:35:59.645 --> 00:36:01.307
Why not just cut
out the eye holes?

764
00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:03.224
He would have needed glue,
then, to hold the mask on.

765
00:36:03.248 --> 00:36:05.513
Not enough time, I suppose.

766
00:36:05.584 --> 00:36:07.382
Well, congratulations, Murdoch.

767
00:36:07.452 --> 00:36:08.647
Another one solved.

768
00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.120
Perhaps.

769
00:36:10.188 --> 00:36:11.349
"Perhaps"?

770
00:36:11.423 --> 00:36:13.153
Perhaps, what does that mean?

771
00:36:13.225 --> 00:36:17.060
Sir, this mask could
hang Byron Beaton.

772
00:36:17.129 --> 00:36:19.325
Why did he not just
throw it in the fire

773
00:36:19.398 --> 00:36:20.923
when he returned to his room?

774
00:36:20.999 --> 00:36:23.025
He couldn't have
expected us to find it

775
00:36:23.101 --> 00:36:24.364
in the secret passageway.

776
00:36:24.436 --> 00:36:27.201
But, then, why appear to you
and Higgins as Timothy's ghost?

777
00:36:27.272 --> 00:36:28.740
What was to be gained from that?

778
00:36:28.807 --> 00:36:30.051
You're overthinking
this, Murdoch.

779
00:36:30.075 --> 00:36:31.907
No, sir, I don't believe I am.

780
00:36:31.977 --> 00:36:33.912
The killer wanted us to
find those passageways

781
00:36:33.979 --> 00:36:35.174
and the mask.

782
00:36:35.247 --> 00:36:36.340
Why?

783
00:36:36.415 --> 00:36:39.180
Because it explains the
appearance of Timothy's ghost

784
00:36:39.251 --> 00:36:41.743
and points the finger
directly at Byron as the killer.

785
00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.083
A frame-up?

786
00:36:43.155 --> 00:36:44.088
Possibly.

787
00:36:44.156 --> 00:36:47.593
Then, if it wasn't Byron,
who else could it have been?

788
00:36:47.659 --> 00:36:51.096
Who first introduced us
to the notion of a ghost?

789
00:36:51.163 --> 00:36:53.029
Godfrey.

790
00:36:53.098 --> 00:36:54.964
Yes, but he was
disingenuous about it,

791
00:36:55.033 --> 00:36:57.468
even dismissing his niece
Claire for being superstitious.

792
00:36:57.536 --> 00:36:58.902
But why?

793
00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:00.836
What did he have
against the brothers?

794
00:37:00.906 --> 00:37:02.465
Did you say Claire
was his niece?

795
00:37:02.541 --> 00:37:03.873
Yes.

796
00:37:03.942 --> 00:37:08.073
Claire told me that she and
Timothy's mother, Chanté,

797
00:37:08.146 --> 00:37:09.307
were cousins.

798
00:37:09.381 --> 00:37:10.974
They were?

799
00:37:11.049 --> 00:37:14.144
But if they were cousins

800
00:37:14.219 --> 00:37:17.087
and Claire is Godfrey's niece...

801
00:37:17.155 --> 00:37:18.282
You're mad!

802
00:37:18.356 --> 00:37:21.053
Why would I impersonate a ghost?

803
00:37:21.126 --> 00:37:23.459
Vengeance, Mr. Godfrey.

804
00:37:23.528 --> 00:37:25.895
Did you murder Chauncey Beaton?

805
00:37:25.964 --> 00:37:28.399
Did you frighten
Ronald Beaton to death?

806
00:37:28.467 --> 00:37:29.467
For what reason?

807
00:37:29.534 --> 00:37:31.503
The Beatons have
always been good to me.

808
00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:33.664
But they treated Timothy badly.

809
00:37:33.739 --> 00:37:36.174
They treated his
mother even worse.

810
00:37:36.241 --> 00:37:37.937
And what concern
would that be to me?

811
00:37:38.009 --> 00:37:41.036
Because your daughter
was Timothy's mother,

812
00:37:41.113 --> 00:37:43.241
which means Timothy
was your grandson.

813
00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:50.579
Yes.

814
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:56.691
But I swear to you, I wasn't
the one wearing that mask.

815
00:37:56.762 --> 00:37:58.196
I didn't kill anyone.

816
00:37:58.263 --> 00:37:59.196
Mr. Godfrey.

817
00:37:59.264 --> 00:38:02.359
I didn't kill anyone!

818
00:38:02.434 --> 00:38:05.871
We encountered
Godfrey here at 1:14 a.m.,

819
00:38:05.937 --> 00:38:08.805
and George and Henry
found the "ghost" here

820
00:38:08.874 --> 00:38:10.866
at 1:20 a.m.

821
00:38:10.942 --> 00:38:13.262
Which gave him six minutes
to change into Timothy's clothes

822
00:38:13.311 --> 00:38:15.551
and scare the living bejesus
out of Crabtree and Higgins.

823
00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:18.482
It's tight, Murdoch, and
he's not a young man.

824
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:19.745
No.

825
00:38:19.818 --> 00:38:21.286
- Sirs.
- Yes, George.

826
00:38:21.353 --> 00:38:22.286
Bad news, I'm afraid.

827
00:38:22.354 --> 00:38:23.413
No less than three maids

828
00:38:23.488 --> 00:38:25.457
swear they saw Godfrey
come out of his room

829
00:38:25.524 --> 00:38:27.459
moments after Ronald's
screams were heard.

830
00:38:27.526 --> 00:38:28.686
Out of his room. You're sure?

831
00:38:28.727 --> 00:38:30.093
Sir.

832
00:38:30.162 --> 00:38:32.563
That's down in the
servants' quarters.

833
00:38:32.631 --> 00:38:34.600
A man can't be in two
places at once, Murdoch.

834
00:38:34.666 --> 00:38:38.159
So, what's your theory now?

835
00:38:43.408 --> 00:38:44.569
Murdoch.

836
00:38:44.643 --> 00:38:45.804
Murdoch!

837
00:38:45.877 --> 00:38:47.004
Sir.

838
00:38:48.079 --> 00:38:51.914
George, you said the
ghost looked directly at you?

839
00:38:51.983 --> 00:38:52.848
That's right.

840
00:38:52.918 --> 00:38:56.980
Gentlemen, I believe we
have to return to Beaton Manor.

841
00:39:02.627 --> 00:39:04.926
And this is exactly
as you saw him.

842
00:39:04.996 --> 00:39:07.830
Um... yes.

843
00:39:07.899 --> 00:39:09.299
But?

844
00:39:09.367 --> 00:39:11.734
Well, it's hard to explain, sir.

845
00:39:11.803 --> 00:39:15.069
The ghost looked at me.

846
00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:16.073
And these eyes
stare straight ahead.

847
00:39:16.141 --> 00:39:16.904
Exactly.

848
00:39:16.975 --> 00:39:19.843
Now you're saying that the
killer never wore a mask?

849
00:39:19.911 --> 00:39:21.607
That's right, sir.

850
00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:22.857
Because he couldn't
look Crabtree in the eye.

851
00:39:22.881 --> 00:39:25.248
Sir, eye contact
is unmistakable.

852
00:39:25.317 --> 00:39:26.317
It's powerful.

853
00:39:26.351 --> 00:39:29.480
One can always tell when
someone is looking at them.

854
00:39:29.554 --> 00:39:32.285
But only seeing eyes
are capable of this.

855
00:39:32.357 --> 00:39:35.350
The eyes of the mask are
dead. They don't connect.

856
00:39:37.028 --> 00:39:38.963
So Timothy did it?

857
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:40.464
Except that he's good and dead.

858
00:39:40.532 --> 00:39:43.366
So it was either his ghost or
his twin, which he didn't have,

859
00:39:43.435 --> 00:39:45.233
so we're back to the ghost.

860
00:39:45.303 --> 00:39:47.499
Or perhaps it was his zombie.

861
00:39:47.572 --> 00:39:49.700
It wasn't his bloody
zombie either.

862
00:39:49.774 --> 00:39:50.867
What is a zombie anyway?

863
00:39:50.942 --> 00:39:53.468
Sir, it's a man who
wakes from the dead

864
00:39:53.545 --> 00:39:55.309
after a certain voodoo spell.

865
00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.612
And did he reconstitute himself
from his burned ashes as well?

866
00:40:00.151 --> 00:40:04.213
George, where did you
learn about these zombies?

867
00:40:04.289 --> 00:40:06.258
From my reading, sir.

868
00:40:06.324 --> 00:40:09.761
But the maid, Claire, knows
more about them than I do.

869
00:40:09.828 --> 00:40:10.761
Readings.

870
00:40:10.829 --> 00:40:13.458
I don't know much
about it, Mr. Murdoch.

871
00:40:13.531 --> 00:40:15.966
I stay away from
that kind of magic.

872
00:40:16.034 --> 00:40:19.527
Tell me what you
do know, Miss Claire.

873
00:40:19.604 --> 00:40:24.304
The bokor, he's a
magic man, a sorcerer.

874
00:40:24.376 --> 00:40:26.902
He rubs some kind of
magic powder into you,

875
00:40:26.978 --> 00:40:28.742
and it kills you dead.

876
00:40:28.813 --> 00:40:30.748
But you don't stay dead.

877
00:40:30.815 --> 00:40:35.185
When you wake up, your
soul is gone and it stays gone.

878
00:40:35.253 --> 00:40:38.485
That's all I know.

879
00:40:38.556 --> 00:40:40.422
It's a shame Master
Timmy's dead.

880
00:40:40.492 --> 00:40:42.393
He could have
told you everything.

881
00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:43.484
He knew about this?

882
00:40:43.561 --> 00:40:44.995
Every time we'd go to Haiti,

883
00:40:45.063 --> 00:40:47.294
he'd go to bokors
to learn their secrets.

884
00:40:47.365 --> 00:40:50.961
I think he wanted to
be a bokor himself.

885
00:40:51.036 --> 00:40:54.837
Turn his brothers into zombies.

886
00:40:54.906 --> 00:40:57.205
A powder? What sort of powder?

887
00:40:57.275 --> 00:40:59.403
All I know is that when
taken into the body,

888
00:40:59.477 --> 00:41:02.413
the poison induces
a death-like trance

889
00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.472
from which the person
eventually awakens.

890
00:41:04.549 --> 00:41:07.212
And you think Timothy
could have taken this powder

891
00:41:07.285 --> 00:41:08.480
to fake his own death?

892
00:41:08.553 --> 00:41:11.580
Yes. Do you think it's possible?

893
00:41:11.656 --> 00:41:14.455
William, I haven't even
had my morning tea.

894
00:41:14.526 --> 00:41:16.392
Yes, I'm aware of that, but...

895
00:41:16.461 --> 00:41:20.091
Well, I suppose it's
possible, in theory.

896
00:41:20.165 --> 00:41:23.624
The poison of the puffer fish
can paralyze the diaphragm

897
00:41:23.702 --> 00:41:26.467
and slow the heart
rate to almost zero.

898
00:41:26.538 --> 00:41:28.871
The puffer fish is
from the Caribbean.

899
00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:30.533
I believe so.

900
00:41:30.608 --> 00:41:33.840
Could this poison have
constituted the bokor's powder?

901
00:41:33.912 --> 00:41:38.213
I suppose it's possible.

902
00:41:38.283 --> 00:41:40.548
But you can't just slow
the body's heart rate down

903
00:41:40.618 --> 00:41:42.052
without consequences.

904
00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:45.420
The brain requires a
constant flow of oxygen.

905
00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:47.322
Or tea.

906
00:41:47.392 --> 00:41:50.521
The maid also said that
when these zombies awoke,

907
00:41:50.595 --> 00:41:52.029
their souls were gone.

908
00:41:52.097 --> 00:41:54.896
Perhaps what they
perceive as a lack of a soul

909
00:41:54.966 --> 00:41:56.525
is actually brain damage.

910
00:41:57.702 --> 00:42:00.399
Could this be done without
suffering such damage?

911
00:42:00.472 --> 00:42:03.931
Well, you'd have to slow
the body's metabolic function.

912
00:42:04.009 --> 00:42:07.946
To do that, you'd need to cool
the body to just above freezing.

913
00:42:08.013 --> 00:42:13.316
By plunging it into a
frozen pool in February?

914
00:42:13.718 --> 00:42:14.777
Puffer fish?

915
00:42:14.853 --> 00:42:17.755
There's a fish that's
actually called puffer?

916
00:42:17.822 --> 00:42:18.983
Yes, sir.

917
00:42:19.057 --> 00:42:22.221
The effects of the fish's poison
last approximately 12 hours.

918
00:42:22.293 --> 00:42:24.853
Long enough to get
a declaration of death

919
00:42:24.929 --> 00:42:26.591
and to make a death mask.

920
00:42:26.664 --> 00:42:28.792
How did Timothy
avoid being cremated?

921
00:42:28.867 --> 00:42:30.665
I suppose he snuck
out of the casket

922
00:42:30.735 --> 00:42:32.465
when he was sure
no one was around.

923
00:42:32.537 --> 00:42:35.371
Would have been some
trick to find a stiff for the coffin

924
00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.772
before it went up in smoke.

925
00:42:36.841 --> 00:42:37.841
Not for a man of means.

926
00:42:37.909 --> 00:42:39.935
Cadavers have been
bought and sold in the past.

927
00:42:40.011 --> 00:42:42.378
He couldn't have
done all this by himself.

928
00:42:42.447 --> 00:42:43.791
No. I believe he
had an accomplice.

929
00:42:43.815 --> 00:42:44.748
Who?

930
00:42:44.816 --> 00:42:47.479
I've given this
some thought, sir.

931
00:42:47.552 --> 00:42:48.713
Timothy may be alive,

932
00:42:48.787 --> 00:42:51.518
but he can't very well
collect on his inheritance.

933
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:53.820
No, it all goes to
Byron at this point.

934
00:42:53.892 --> 00:42:54.825
That's right.

935
00:42:54.893 --> 00:42:56.293
And if Byron is to hang,

936
00:42:56.361 --> 00:42:58.887
then who would collect
once he was dead?

937
00:42:58.963 --> 00:43:00.625
- The wifey.
- That's right.

938
00:43:00.698 --> 00:43:02.997
The same woman who
discovered Timothy's body.

939
00:43:03.068 --> 00:43:07.335
The same woman who
was once courted by Timothy.

940
00:43:07.405 --> 00:43:10.500
And that should
be the last of it.

941
00:43:12.477 --> 00:43:13.968
Going on a trip, Mrs. Beaton?

942
00:43:14.045 --> 00:43:15.604
Yes, Detective.

943
00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:18.309
I'm going to Montreal for...

944
00:43:18.383 --> 00:43:21.046
Well, I don't know how long.

945
00:43:21.119 --> 00:43:24.351
I just know that if I stay
in this house another day,

946
00:43:24.422 --> 00:43:25.355
I'll go mad.

947
00:43:25.423 --> 00:43:27.324
Ah, yes. I understand.

948
00:43:27.392 --> 00:43:28.451
Bad memories.

949
00:43:28.526 --> 00:43:32.691
My husband murdered
his own brothers.

950
00:43:32.764 --> 00:43:34.596
What could make
him do such a thing?

951
00:43:37.535 --> 00:43:40.767
There must be some
kind of evil in these walls.

952
00:43:40.839 --> 00:43:43.138
Is this a permanent move, then?

953
00:43:44.476 --> 00:43:45.535
I don't know.

954
00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:47.044
And what of the estate?

955
00:43:47.112 --> 00:43:49.138
Let the lawyers have it.

956
00:43:49.214 --> 00:43:51.843
I want nothing to do with it.

957
00:43:51.916 --> 00:43:56.650
As far as I'm
concerned, it's all cursed.

958
00:43:56.721 --> 00:43:58.690
Good day, Detective.

959
00:43:58.756 --> 00:44:01.954
Good day, Mrs. Beaton.

960
00:44:02.026 --> 00:44:04.689
Sir, you're not just
going to let her leave.

961
00:44:04.762 --> 00:44:06.424
She's not leaving us, George.

962
00:44:06.498 --> 00:44:09.468
She's leading us.

963
00:44:30.555 --> 00:44:33.115
I won't be long, Tom.

964
00:44:34.692 --> 00:44:35.625
Hello.

965
00:44:35.693 --> 00:44:38.288
- Good day, sir.
- How can I help you?

966
00:44:38.363 --> 00:44:42.164
I'm looking for Rowena Beaton.
I'm told she's staying here.

967
00:44:42.233 --> 00:44:45.635
Yes, but I didn't know
she was expecting visitors.

968
00:44:45.703 --> 00:44:47.171
Let me call for her.

969
00:44:49.707 --> 00:44:51.938
Rowena?

970
00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:55.344
A gentleman is here to see you.

971
00:44:55.413 --> 00:44:57.075
And your name, sir?

972
00:44:57.148 --> 00:44:58.172
Aldington Bird.

973
00:44:58.249 --> 00:44:59.740
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Bird.

974
00:44:59.817 --> 00:45:00.944
The same.

975
00:45:01.019 --> 00:45:02.419
And you are?

976
00:45:02.487 --> 00:45:04.422
Detective William Murdoch...

977
00:45:06.824 --> 00:45:09.225
of the Toronto Constabulary.

978
00:45:15.066 --> 00:45:16.398
Damn you.

979
00:45:23.942 --> 00:45:26.036
It was all a sham, then?

980
00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:28.909
Every caress, every
sigh of affection.

981
00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:30.539
I'm afraid so.

982
00:45:30.615 --> 00:45:34.052
Rowena was a willing pawn
in your brother's revenge.

983
00:45:34.118 --> 00:45:36.246
Whatever compassion
she had for you

984
00:45:36.321 --> 00:45:39.086
was subverted by her
desire to be with Timothy.

985
00:45:39.157 --> 00:45:40.648
It was my fault.

986
00:45:40.725 --> 00:45:43.957
Would it have been so hard
to treat him with respect?

987
00:45:44.028 --> 00:45:45.860
Something to contemplate.

988
00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:48.900
I actually felt triumphant
when I stole Rowena from him.

989
00:45:48.967 --> 00:45:51.027
Or thought I had.

990
00:45:51.569 --> 00:45:54.004
Shameful. I've deserved this.

991
00:45:54.072 --> 00:45:57.304
Begging your pardon,
sir. No one deserved this.

992
00:45:57.375 --> 00:46:00.243
What would they have
done with the estate?

993
00:46:00.311 --> 00:46:02.371
I suppose sell off Beaton Manor.

994
00:46:02.447 --> 00:46:04.177
I should probably
sell it myself.

995
00:46:04.249 --> 00:46:05.308
But who would want it?

996
00:46:05.383 --> 00:46:06.908
The cursed house
of a cursed family.

997
00:46:06.985 --> 00:46:09.682
An all-too-human curse.

998
00:46:09.754 --> 00:46:12.155
No ghosts, no magic.

999
00:46:12.223 --> 00:46:14.124
I suppose you're right.

1000
00:46:14.192 --> 00:46:16.718
Dwelling on it is not worth it.

1001
00:46:16.794 --> 00:46:19.389
Perhaps I'll open our
doors to the public.

1002
00:46:19.464 --> 00:46:22.127
People love these
so-called haunted houses.

1003
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.429
An intriguing idea.

1004
00:46:23.501 --> 00:46:26.903
I might haunt it when I die.

1005
00:46:26.971 --> 00:46:30.305
Which, given my family
history, could be any day now.

1006
00:46:33.478 --> 00:46:36.676
That was a joke, Detective.

1007
00:46:36.748 --> 00:46:38.376
I'm glad to hear it.

1008
00:46:38.449 --> 00:46:40.748
Well...

1009
00:46:40.818 --> 00:46:43.583
thank you for everything.

1010
00:46:43.655 --> 00:46:45.317
Good day, Mr. Beaton.

1011
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:47.154
And superstition be damned.

1012
00:46:47.225 --> 00:46:48.318
Good luck.

1013
00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:03.806
Mr. Beaton?

1014
00:47:03.875 --> 00:47:05.673
Mr. Beaton?

1015
00:47:05.743 --> 00:47:08.736
