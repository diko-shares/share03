00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:56.263
I WASN'T ASLEEP, BABY.

328
00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:56.263
I WAS CLOSING MY EYES

329
00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:56.263
AND VISUALIZING YOUR WORDS.

330
00:09:56.263 --> 00:09:58.139
OH, REALLY?

LET ME ASK YOU GUYS

346
00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:17.033
A QUESTION.

347
00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:18.993
WHEN THE CHIEF GOES

349
00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:22.289
WHICH ONE OF YOU GUYS

351
00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:22.289
AND WHICH ONE WIPES?

352
00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:24.040
NOW, THAT'S THE BALL HOLDER,

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.377
YEAH, YOU CAN TELL

355
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.377
BY THE LITTLE CUP IN HIS HAND.

356
00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:29.921

365
00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:40.557
WHAT'S THAT?

366
00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:42.642
WHY, I THINK I HEAR

367
00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:42.642

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:44.978
WE BETTER GET GOING.

369
00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:44.978
WHO'S TURN IS IT TO WIPE?

370
00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:47.230

376
00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:51.151
THAT'S RIGHT.

377
00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:56.906
(Chief)

378
00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:56.906

00:49:19.123 --> 00:49:22.084
OK, YOU GUYS.

1921
00:49:19.123 --> 00:49:22.084
WHAT DOES IT MEAN

1922
00:49:22.084 --> 00:49:25.671
WHEN A GUY IS IN

1923
00:49:22.084 --> 00:49:25.671
A REALLY BAD RELATIONSHIP

1924
00:49:25.671 --> 00:49:29.467
AND IT'S REALLY, REALLY

1925
00:49:25.671 --> 00:49:29.467

1926
00:49:25.671 --> 00:49:29.467
TO BE WITH YOU,

1927
00:49:29.467 --> 00:49:32.845
BUT HE JUST CAN'T

1928
00:49:29.467 --> 00:49:32.845
SEEM TO BREAK UP

1929
00:49:29.467 --> 00:49:32.845
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND?

1930
00:49:32.845 --> 00:49:35.139
IT MEANS YOU'RE

1931
00:49:32.845 --> 00:49:35.139

00:49:39.226 --> 00:49:40.895
WELL, YOU SAID IT.

1936
00:49:40.895 --> 00:49:43.773
YOU KNOW,

1937
00:49:40.895 --> 00:49:43.773
SOMETIMES YOU SOUND

1938
00:49:40.895 --> 00:49:43.773
JUST LIKE A MAN.

1939
00:49:43.773 --> 00:49:45.524
SO I'VE BEEN TOLD.

1940
00:49:45.524 --> 00:49:46.943
[giggling]

1941
00:49:46.943 --> 00:49:49.111
WHAT SHE MEANS

1942
00:49:46.943 --> 00:49:49.111
TO SAY, HONEY,

1943
00:49:49.111 --> 00:49:51.196
IS MAYBE YOU'RE JUST

1944
00:49:49.111 --> 00:49:51.196
MAKING YOURSELF

1945
00:49:51.196 --> 00:49:54.158
JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO,

1946
00:49:51.196 --> 00:49:54.158
LIKE, AVAILABLE, YOU KNOW?

1947
00:49:54.158 --> 00:49:56.243
OH, COME ON, YOU GUYS.

1948
00:49:56.243 --> 00:49:59.580
DON'T ACT LIKE YOU

1949
00:49:56.243 --> 00:49:59.580
HAVEN'T DONE IT BEFORE.

1950
00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:02.708
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS

1951
00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:02.708
WHEN YOU REALLY

1952
00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:02.708
CARE ABOUT SOMEONE.

1953
00:50:02.708 --> 00:50:04.543
I MEAN, YOU CALL THEM

1954
00:50:02.708 --> 00:50:04.543
ALL DAY LONG

1955
00:50:04.543 --> 00:50:07.045
BECAUSE YOU JUST WANNA

1956
00:50:04.543 --> 00:50:07.045
KNOW HOW THEIR DAY

1957
00:50:04.543 --> 00:50:07.045
IS GOING, YOU KNOW,

1958
00:50:07.045 --> 00:50:08.965
AND--AND WHAT

1959
00:50:07.045 --> 00:50:08.965
THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT,

1960
00:50:08.965 --> 00:50:12.008
AND IF THEY'RE

1961
00:50:08.965 --> 00:50:12.008
THINKING ABOUT YOU.

1962
00:50:12.008 --> 00:50:15.220
YOU SPEND ALL DAY TRYING

1963
00:50:12.008 --> 00:50:15.220
TO FIND THE PERFECT OUTFIT.

1964
00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:16.889
YOU EVEN CHANGE

1965
00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:16.889
YOUR HAIRSTYLE

1966
00:50:16.889 --> 00:50:18.933
JUST SO HE'LL

1967
00:50:16.889 --> 00:50:18.933
TAKE A SECOND LOOK.

1968
00:50:18.933 --> 00:50:20.768
BUT THEY NEVER NOTICE.

1969
00:50:20.768 --> 00:50:23.980
SOMETIMES I JUST WISH

1970
00:50:20.768 --> 00:50:23.980
THAT THEY COULD

1971
00:50:20.768 --> 00:50:23.980
TRADE PLACES WITH US

1972
00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:26.607
SO THAT THEY WOULD KNOW

1973
00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:26.607
HOW IT FEELS. YOU KNOW?

1974
00:50:28.526 --> 00:50:30.945
OH, MY GOD, LOOK.

1975
00:50:28.526 --> 00:50:30.945
IT'S MEGAN'S COMMERCIAL.

1976
00:50:33.322 --> 00:50:36.241
I WON'T LET

1977
00:50:33.322 --> 00:50:36.241
GENITAL HERPES

1978
00:50:33.322 --> 00:50:36.241
SLOW  ME  DOWN.

1979
00:50:36.241 --> 00:50:38.034
THAT'S WHY I USE VALTRUM.

1980
00:50:38.034 --> 00:50:40.872
HEY. YOU WANNA

1981
00:50:38.034 --> 00:50:40.872
PLAY WITH  ME?

1982
00:50:40.872 --> 00:50:42.080

1983
00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:45.376
I WON'T TELL IF YOU WON'T.

1984
00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:45.376
SHH.

1985
00:50:45.376 --> 00:50:47.336
I  SO  COULD HAVE DONE THAT PART.

1986
00:50:47.336 --> 00:50:49.421
SHE DOESN'T EVEN  HAVE  HERPES.

1987
00:50:49.421 --> 00:50:50.923
UHH.

1988
00:50:52.174 --> 00:50:53.258

00:50:53.258 --> 00:50:55.177
YEAH.

1991
00:50:55.177 --> 00:50:58.472
OH, MY GOD!

YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

1994
00:51:00.182 --> 00:51:02.935
I THINK YOU MIGHT

1995
00:51:00.182 --> 00:51:02.935
HAVE BEEN BLACK

1996
00:51:00.182 --> 00:51:02.935

2031
00:51:54.152 --> 00:51:59.825

00:52:50.417 --> 00:52:53.504
THAT'S EIGHTIES.

2068
00:52:50.417 --> 00:52:53.504
YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO OUT

2069
00:52:50.417 --> 00:52:53.504
AND BUY A TRANS-AM.

2070
00:52:53.504 --> 00:52:56.590

YOU LOOK HIM DEAD IN THE EYE

2080
00:53:07.351 --> 00:53:10.354
