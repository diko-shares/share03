00:06:59.155 --> 00:07:00.923
-I could show you around.
-Hmm?

181
00:07:00.956 --> 00:07:03.459
I mean, this is
pretty much it, but...

182
00:07:03.492 --> 00:07:05.061
Mmm. Thanks.

183
00:07:05.094 --> 00:07:07.196
But we're just passing by
on our way down south.

184
00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:08.497
We're gonna spend
the winter there.

185
00:07:08.531 --> 00:07:09.598
Where are you guys going?

186
00:07:09.632 --> 00:07:11.033
We spend winter here

187
00:07:11.067 --> 00:07:12.335
to avoid psycho killers
like your...

188
00:07:12.368 --> 00:07:14.203
-Sorry. Wart.
-(Gwen yelling, sputtering)

189
00:07:14.236 --> 00:07:17.540
Wait. So you don't go anywhere
for the winter?

190
00:07:17.573 --> 00:07:19.041
Uh, nope.

191
00:07:19.075 --> 00:07:21.344
(gasps) You should
totally come with us.

192
00:07:21.377 --> 00:07:23.145
-What? Really?
-(Gwen gasps, coughs)

193
00:07:23.179 --> 00:07:25.314
Yes! Your flock could
totally join ours.

194
00:07:25.348 --> 00:07:27.116
Oh, my gosh,
this will be so cool.

195
00:07:27.149 --> 00:07:29.618
You will love migrating.
The sun, the sand.

196
00:07:29.652 --> 00:07:31.454
Wait. Do you like tropical food?

197
00:07:31.487 --> 00:07:33.155
-What's your take on bananas?
-Oh. I don't...

198
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:34.657
Ah, you're gonna love 'em!

199
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.559
You hold this.
I'll go ask my dad.

200
00:07:36.592 --> 00:07:37.927
Dad! Dad!

201
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.428
-What just happened?
-Dad!

202
00:07:39.462 --> 00:07:41.630
I don't know,
but you're in trouble.

203
00:07:41.664 --> 00:07:43.299
MACK:
Dax! Gwen!

204
00:07:43.332 --> 00:07:46.168
Are you crazy? You can't
just take off like that.

205
00:07:46.202 --> 00:07:48.404
-He made me do it!
-What?

206
00:07:48.437 --> 00:07:50.639
And he talked to a girl.

207
00:07:50.673 --> 00:07:52.308
-A girl?
-Gwen!

208
00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:54.677
Yeah, and he told her
he wants to marry her.

209
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.979
What? I didn't say that!

210
00:07:57.012 --> 00:07:58.314
You said it with your eyes.

211
00:07:58.347 --> 00:08:00.316
Dad, he's hitting me!
He's hitting me!

212
00:08:00.349 --> 00:08:01.951
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Enough! Enough!

213
00:08:01.984 --> 00:08:04.453
-Sibling cruelty!
-Enough.

214
00:08:04.487 --> 00:08:05.988
Okay. Hello.

215
00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:07.490
Hi. Hi. Big hellos.

216
00:08:07.523 --> 00:08:08.924
And we're good. Let's go.

217
00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.259
-Mack.
-What? I said hi.

218
00:08:10.292 --> 00:08:11.927
I smiled. I made eye contact.

219
00:08:11.961 --> 00:08:13.396
I checked all the boxes.

220
00:08:13.429 --> 00:08:14.296
Hey there.

221
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.665
I hear you want to join
our migration.

222
00:08:16.699 --> 00:08:18.567
Sorry?

223
00:08:18.601 --> 00:08:20.536
Oh, we're going back to Jamaica.

224
00:08:20.569 --> 00:08:21.704
Have you ever been?

225
00:08:21.737 --> 00:08:23.406
No.

226
00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:25.274
Oh, it's just magical.

227
00:08:25.307 --> 00:08:27.676
I swear, there's even
a luminous lagoon

228
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.111
where the water glows.

229
00:08:29.145 --> 00:08:31.414
Oh, wow. Oh, I really
want to see that.

230
00:08:31.447 --> 00:08:33.282
(chuckling):
Well, then it is settled.

231
00:08:33.315 --> 00:08:35.418
Your whole flock can join us.

232
00:08:35.451 --> 00:08:36.585
This is gonna be great.

233
00:08:36.619 --> 00:08:38.087
Oh, gosh. That's...

234
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.655
(laughing):
That's just so nice of you.

235
00:08:39.688 --> 00:08:41.323
Wait, wait, wait. (chuckles)

236
00:08:41.357 --> 00:08:44.026
I think there's a slight
misunderstanding here.

237
00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:46.162
Unfortunately,
we're just slammed this winter.

238
00:08:46.195 --> 00:08:47.663
Aren't we, Pam?

239
00:08:47.696 --> 00:08:49.698
'Cause we've got the thing,
and then the... (stammering)

240
00:08:49.732 --> 00:08:52.968
We got the thing after that.
So, you know what? We can't go.

241
00:08:53.002 --> 00:08:54.437
But you guys go.

242
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.538
Have a great time.

243
00:08:55.571 --> 00:08:59.275
And, you know, tell
the glowing water we said hi.

244
00:09:00.609 --> 00:09:03.112
Uh, well, maybe next year, then?

245
00:09:03.145 --> 00:09:05.181
MACK:
You got it. Next year!

246
00:09:05.214 --> 00:09:10.219
Uh, well, I guess
it's time for us to go.

247
00:09:13.689 --> 00:09:16.225
Uh, have a nice trip.

248
00:09:17.092 --> 00:09:18.594
Thanks. (chuckles)

249
00:09:18.627 --> 00:09:21.363
Have a nice... pond.

250
00:09:29.572 --> 00:09:32.475
I'm so sorry you can't
have babies with her.

251
00:09:33.108 --> 00:09:35.511
(ducks squawking in distance)

252
00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:41.550
That was so... rude!

253
00:09:41.584 --> 00:09:42.718
I know.

254
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:44.487
"Have a nice pond."

255
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.688
Who says that?

256
00:09:45.721 --> 00:09:47.356
That's just poor parenting.

257
00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:49.191
Not them. You.

258
00:09:49.225 --> 00:09:51.760
-Me?
-Yes, you.

259
00:09:51.794 --> 00:09:54.663
Okay. So I got
a little carried away.

260
00:09:54.697 --> 00:09:56.532
(chuckles):
But migration?

261
00:09:56.565 --> 00:09:58.067
What a stupid idea.

262
00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.302
-Ugh. Okay. You're impossible.
-Why?

263
00:10:00.336 --> 00:10:02.304
Because I found
a safe place for us to live

264
00:10:02.338 --> 00:10:04.273
and we're happy here?

265
00:10:04.306 --> 00:10:06.308
You mean you're happy here.

266
00:10:06.342 --> 00:10:07.510
What?

267
00:10:07.543 --> 00:10:10.145
I-I want us to get out
and see the world.

268
00:10:10.179 --> 00:10:11.514
-Me, too, Dad.
-Yeah.

269
00:10:11.547 --> 00:10:14.250
I want to go to Jamai...
Jam... J...

270
00:10:14.283 --> 00:10:16.085
where they make jam.

271
00:10:16.118 --> 00:10:18.454
You-you really want
those things?

272
00:10:18.487 --> 00:10:19.755
ALL:
Yes.

273
00:10:19.788 --> 00:10:22.157
-Really?
-ALL: Yes.

274
00:10:22.191 --> 00:10:23.292
No home improvements?

275
00:10:23.325 --> 00:10:24.793
-PAM and DAX: No!
-GWEN: Yes.

276
00:10:24.827 --> 00:10:26.695
I mean... I mean no.

277
00:10:26.729 --> 00:10:29.265
D-Do you know what can happen
on a trip that long?

278
00:10:29.298 --> 00:10:30.533
What sort of father would I be

279
00:10:30.566 --> 00:10:32.434
if I put my young fowl
in harm's way

280
00:10:32.468 --> 00:10:35.638
for no reason except a chance
at a Caribbean vacation?

281
00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:37.706
A father who knows
it's important for his kids

282
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.542
to see other parts of the world.

283
00:10:39.575 --> 00:10:41.443
Mack, I don't want
to miss out on life

284
00:10:41.477 --> 00:10:43.679
because you're afraid
to leave this pond.

285
00:10:43.712 --> 00:10:46.248
This isn't about migration.

286
00:10:46.282 --> 00:10:49.285
It's about adventure.

287
00:10:49.318 --> 00:10:52.421
Seeing what else
life has to offer.

288
00:10:52.454 --> 00:10:54.723
Is that a little scary? Sure.

289
00:10:54.757 --> 00:10:57.092
But isn't it worth it?

290
00:10:58.427 --> 00:10:59.828
No, Pam.

291
00:10:59.862 --> 00:11:01.697
Not really.

292
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.233
(Pam sighs)

293
00:11:05.134 --> 00:11:09.271
You really need to open
your eyes, Mack,

294
00:11:09.305 --> 00:11:12.174
before you miss it all.

295
00:11:12.207 --> 00:11:14.176
Come on, kids.

296
00:11:15.778 --> 00:11:18.180
♪ ♪

297
00:11:26.755 --> 00:11:28.624
-(snoring)
-Hmm?

298
00:11:29.892 --> 00:11:31.460
Huh? Huh?

-(screams)

300
00:11:33.228 --> 00:11:34.863
Uncle Dan,
what are you doing here?

(coughing)

302
00:11:36.632 --> 00:11:38.334
(groans) I don't know.

303
00:11:38.367 --> 00:11:41.236
I must have drifted
from my nest again.

(grunting)

305
00:11:43.472 --> 00:11:45.407
Be a good boy
and get me back there.

306
00:11:45.441 --> 00:11:46.910
Give me a little push.

307
00:11:46.943 --> 00:11:49.244
(grunting):
All right.

308
00:11:50.312 --> 00:11:53.148
(muffled yelling, sputtering)

309
00:11:56.585 --> 00:11:58.487
Thank you. (sighs)

310
00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.223
I heard the little family tiff.

311
00:12:01.256 --> 00:12:03.225
I got to say...

312
00:12:03.258 --> 00:12:04.627
you're right.

313
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.495
Wha... I am?

314
00:12:06.528 --> 00:12:07.496
(scoffs) Please.

315
00:12:07.529 --> 00:12:09.231
What's all the travel talk?

316
00:12:09.264 --> 00:12:11.333
I mean,
why can't we be satisfied

317
00:12:11.367 --> 00:12:13.235
with what we already have?

318
00:12:13.268 --> 00:12:15.237
Well, yeah.

319
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.505
I mean, you got food right here.

320
00:12:16.538 --> 00:12:18.874
We got a pond right here.
Right?

321
00:12:18.908 --> 00:12:21.176
Yeah. Food, the pond.

322
00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:22.878
Why go anywhere else?

323
00:12:22.912 --> 00:12:24.513
Stick to your beliefs, kid.

324
00:12:24.546 --> 00:12:27.282
-Don't change for anyone.
-Exactly.

325
00:12:27.316 --> 00:12:28.952
And you'll end up just like me.

326
00:12:28.985 --> 00:12:30.786
-Happy.
-Yeah.

327
00:12:30.819 --> 00:12:31.955
-Healthy.
-Yeah.

328
00:12:31.988 --> 00:12:33.622
And totally alone!

329
00:12:33.656 --> 00:12:35.658
Yeah! Wait, what?

330
00:12:35.691 --> 00:12:37.226
That's right.

331
00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:40.229
You'll be living the dream.

332
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.399
Whoa, that was exhausting.

333
00:12:43.432 --> 00:12:45.601
I'm gonna just rest here.

334
00:12:49.939 --> 00:12:51.941
Rise and shine, Mallards!

335
00:12:51.975 --> 00:12:53.642
We're burning daylight.

336
00:12:53.676 --> 00:12:54.944
Up and at 'em.

337
00:12:54.978 --> 00:12:56.578
Let's go, go, go!

338
00:12:56.612 --> 00:12:58.414
Here's breakfast.

339
00:12:58.447 --> 00:13:00.416
Dad, what are you doing?

340
00:13:00.449 --> 00:13:01.985
Getting your sorry feathers
out of bed.

341
00:13:02.018 --> 00:13:03.920
Come on. We got to get ready.

342
00:13:03.953 --> 00:13:06.355
Mack, ready for what?

343
00:13:06.388 --> 00:13:08.357
Nothing. Just, you know,

344
00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:12.294
for our big,
super fun family migration!

345
00:13:12.327 --> 00:13:13.562
What?

346
00:13:13.595 --> 00:13:15.864
Ha! Bet you didn't
see that coming.

347
00:13:15.898 --> 00:13:17.599
-Are-are you serious?
-Yep.

348
00:13:17.633 --> 00:13:20.970
An adventure into
the totally unknown.

349
00:13:21.004 --> 00:13:22.705
And I'm gonna love it.

350
00:13:22.738 --> 00:13:25.307
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. I-Is this real?

351
00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:26.709
What do you mean,
"Is this real?"

352
00:13:26.742 --> 00:13:27.810
We're really going?

353
00:13:27.843 --> 00:13:28.945
-Yes.
-On a migration?

354
00:13:28.978 --> 00:13:30.446
-Mm-hmm.
-To Jamaica?

355
00:13:30.479 --> 00:13:31.780
-Yeah.
-Together?

356
00:13:31.814 --> 00:13:32.848
-Yes.
-Like, everyone?

357

897

A-A chef?

898
00:36:00.662 --> 00:36:01.998
Yeah. A-A chef.

899
00:36:02.031 --> 00:36:04.699
Like a predator
except instead of eating you,

900
00:36:04.733 --> 00:36:07.203
he feeds you to a group
of much lazier predators.

901
00:36:07.236 --> 00:36:09.172
(chuckles) Right this way.

902
00:36:16.979 --> 00:36:18.780

00:36:18.814 --> 00:36:20.983

Hey, Delroy.

911
00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:43.705
How's it going?
It's been a while.

912
00:36:43.738 --> 00:36:45.707
You look good.
Slip me some feather.

913
00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.642
I brought you
a nice family of mallards.

914
00:36:47.676 --> 00:36:49.644
They need to ask you something.

915
00:36:49.678 --> 00:36:51.646
(Delroy groans)

916
00:36:53.282 --> 00:36:57.220
Oh. Well, Mr. Delroy,

917
00:36:57.253 --> 00:36:59.989

CHUMP:
Told ya.

922
00:37:08.797 --> 00:37:09.999
He's a little sensitive
about it.

923
00:37:10.032 --> 00:37:12.235
He was born and raised there.

924
00:37:12.268 --> 00:37:13.835
What happened?

925
00:37:13.869 --> 00:37:16.771
The chef snatched him up
in the middle of the night.

926
00:37:16.805 --> 00:37:20.376
Next day, old Del's gone
from free bird to jailbird.

927
00:37:20.409 --> 00:37:21.810
Come on, D.

928
00:37:21.843 --> 00:37:23.879
Just tell them how to get there.

929
00:37:23.913 --> 00:37:26.149
(Delroy takes a deep breath)

930
00:37:26.182 --> 00:37:29.018
Fly to the big green statue,
fly due south for three miles,

931
00:37:29.051 --> 00:37:31.853
then due east for one mile,
due west for ten miles,

932
00:37:31.887 --> 00:37:33.122
then you southwest for one mile,

933

934
00:37:34.823 --> 00:37:37.260
