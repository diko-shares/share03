00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:22.690
Hello?

2
00:00:22.773 --> 00:00:24.734
-Hello.
-Yes?

3
00:00:24.817 --> 00:00:26.068
Who is this?

4
00:00:26.152 --> 00:00:27.570
Who are you trying to reach?

5
00:00:27.653 --> 00:00:28.905
What number is this?

6
00:00:28.988 --> 00:00:30.740
What number are you trying to reach?

7
00:00:30.823 --> 00:00:31.949
I don't know.

8
00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:33.701
Well, I think you have the wrong number.

9
00:00:33.784 --> 00:00:36.078
-Do I?
-It happens. Take it easy.

10
00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:46.130
Hello?

11
00:00:46.214 --> 00:00:48.716
I'm sorry.
I guess I dialed the wrong number.

12
00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:50.593
Well, so why'd you dial it again?

13
00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:52.303
To apologize.

14
00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:54.180
You're forgiven. Bye now.

15
00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:55.932
Wait. Wait. Don't hang up.

16
00:00:56.015 --> 00:00:58.309
-What?
-/ want to talk fo you for a second.

17
00:00:58.893 --> 00:01:01.062
They've got 900 numbers for that. See ya.

18
00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:23.876
Hello?

19
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.962
Why don't you want to talk to me?

20
00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:27.046
Who is this?

21
00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:29.215
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.

22
00:01:30.174 --> 00:01:31.384
I don't think so.

23
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.220
What's that noise?

24
00:01:34.303 --> 00:01:36.347
-Popcorn.
-You're making popcorn?

25
00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:39.183
I only eat popcorn at the movies.

26
00:01:39.267 --> 00:01:41.185
Well, I'm getting ready to watch a video.

27
00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:42.687
Really? What?

28
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.939
Oh, just some scary movie.

29
00:01:45.022 --> 00:01:46.565
You like scary movies?

30
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.151
What's your favorite scary movie?

31
00:01:49.735 --> 00:01:50.778
I don't know.

32
00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:53.364
You have to have a favorite.
What comes fo mind?

33
00:01:55.283 --> 00:01:56.325
Halloween.

34
00:01:56.867 --> 00:01:58.744
You know, the one
with the guy in the white mask

35
00:01:58.828 --> 00:02:00.913
who walks around and stalks babysitters.

36
00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:03.499
-Yeah.
-What's yours?

37
00:02:03.582 --> 00:02:04.625
Guess.

38
00:02:06.752 --> 00:02:08.337
Nightmare on Elm Street.

39
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:10.965
Is that the one
where the guy had knives for fingers?

40
00:02:11.048 --> 00:02:12.300
Yeah, Freddy Krueger.

41
00:02:12.383 --> 00:02:15.970
Freddy. That's right.
I like that movie. If was scary.

42
00:02:16.053 --> 00:02:18.514
Well, the first one was,
but the rest sucked.

43
00:02:18.597 --> 00:02:20.641
So, you got a boyfriend?

44
00:02:21.434 --> 00:02:24.103
Why? You wanna ask me out on a date?

45
00:02:24.186 --> 00:02:26.647
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?

46
00:02:27.606 --> 00:02:29.900
-No.
-You never fold me your name.

47
00:02:30.401 --> 00:02:31.694
Why do you want to know my name?

48
00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:33.696
â€˜Cause I want to know who I'm looking at.

49
00:02:35.698 --> 00:02:36.824
What did you say?

50
00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.244
I want to know who I'm talking fo.

51
00:02:40.328 --> 00:02:41.579
That's not what you said.

52
00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:42.913
What do you think I said?

53
00:02:46.167 --> 00:02:47.418
What?

54
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:49.962
Hello?

55
00:02:51.297 --> 00:02:52.923
Look, I gotta go.

56
00:02:53.007 --> 00:02:54.842
Wait. I thought we were gonna go out.

57
00:02:55.384 --> 00:02:57.303
Nah, I don't think so.

58
00:02:57.386 --> 00:02:58.596
Don't hang up on me.

59
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.564
Shit.

60
00:03:10.358 --> 00:03:11.359
Yes?

61
00:03:11.442 --> 00:03:14.195
I told you not fo hang up on me.

62
00:03:14.278 --> 00:03:16.197
-What do you want?
-To talk.

63
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.532
Well, dial someone else, okay?

64
00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:29.377
Listen, asshole--

65
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.003
No, you listen, you little bitch!

66
00:03:31.087 --> 00:03:34.215
You hang up on me again,
I'll gut you like a fish, understand?

67
00:03:36.634 --> 00:03:38.010
Yeah.

68
00:03:38.094 --> 00:03:40.054
Is this some kind of joke?

69
00:03:40.137 --> 00:03:42.473
More of a game, really.

70
00:03:44.392 --> 00:03:45.976
Can you handle that...

71
00:03:48.062 --> 00:03:49.188
blondie?

72
00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:01.784
Can you see me?

73
00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:09.291
Listen. I am two seconds away
from calling the police.

74
00:04:09.375 --> 00:04:13.629
They'd never make it in time.
We're out in the middle of nowhere.

75
00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:15.339
What do you want?

76
00:04:15.423 --> 00:04:18.676
To see what your insides look like.

77
00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:28.102
Who's there?

78
00:04:29.395 --> 00:04:30.521
Who's there?

79
00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:33.149
I'm calling the police.

80
00:04:36.402 --> 00:04:38.195
You should never say, "Who's there?"

81
00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:40.906
Don't you watch scary movies?
It's a death wish.

82
00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.119
You might as well come out here fo
investigate a strange noise or something.

83
00:04:46.162 --> 00:04:47.163
Look...

84
00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:51.500
you've had your fun now, so I think
you'd better just leave or else.

85
00:04:51.584 --> 00:04:53.169
Or else what?

86
00:04:53.252 --> 00:04:55.629
Or else my boyfriend
will be here any second,

87
00:04:55.713 --> 00:04:57.965
and he'll be pissed when he finds out.

88
00:04:58.048 --> 00:04:59.592
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.

89
00:04:59.675 --> 00:05:02.052
I lied! I do have a boyfriend,

90
00:05:02.136 --> 00:05:04.430
and he'll be here any second,
SO your ass better be gone.

91
00:05:04.513 --> 00:05:05.598
Sure.

92
00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:07.850
I swear.

93
00:05:09.393 --> 00:05:13.898
He's big, and he plays football,
and he'll kick the shit out of you!

94
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:15.608
I'm getting scared.

95
00:05:15.691 --> 00:05:17.234
I'm shaking in my boots.

96
00:05:18.027 --> 00:05:20.029
So you'd better just leave.

97
00:05:20.112 --> 00:05:21.947
His name wouldn't be. ..

98
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:23.532
Steve, would it?

99
00:05:25.868 --> 00:05:27.620
How do you know his name?

100
00:05:28.162 --> 00:05:30.039
Turn on the patio lights...

101
00:05:30.915 --> 00:05:31.916
again.

102
00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:45.012
Oh, God!

103
00:05:46.013 --> 00:05:47.681
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

104
00:05:47.765 --> 00:05:49.683
-Where are you? Where are you?
-Guess.

105
00:05:49.767 --> 00:05:51.227
Please don't hurt him.

106
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.853
That all depends on you.

107
00:05:52.937 --> 00:05:54.522
Why are you doing this?

108
00:05:54.605 --> 00:05:57.066
-/ want to play a game.
-No.

109
00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:59.735
-Then he dies right now.
-No! No!

110
00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:01.028
Which is it?

111
00:06:02.196 --> 00:06:03.697
Which is it?

112
00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:08.244
What kind of game?

113
00:06:08.327 --> 00:06:12.331
Turn off the light.
You'll see what kind of game.

114
00:06:13.207 --> 00:06:14.333
Just do it!

115
00:06:17.294 --> 00:06:20.256
Casey! No! No!

116
00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.383
No! Casey!

117
00:06:22.466 --> 00:06:24.218
Here's how we play.

118
00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:28.806
I ask a question.
If you get it right, Steve lives.

119
00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.100
-Please don't do this.
-Come on. It'll be fun.

120
00:06:31.183 --> 00:06:34.937
-Please. Please.
-It's an easy category. Movie trivia.

121
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.147
I'll even give you a warm-up question.

122
00:06:37.231 --> 00:06:38.524
Don't do this. I can't--

123
00:06:38.607 --> 00:06:41.735
-Name the killer in Halloween.
-No.

124
00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:44.905
Come on. It's your favorite
scary movie, remember?

125
00:06:44.989 --> 00:06:47.408
He had a white mask.
He stalked the babysitters.

126
00:06:47.491 --> 00:06:49.451
-I don't know.
-Come on. Yes, you do.

127
00:06:49.535 --> 00:06:52.871
-No. Please.
-What's his name?

128
00:06:52.955 --> 00:06:55.916
-I can't think.
-Steve's counting on you.

129
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.129
Michael. Michael Myers.

130
00:07:00.212 --> 00:07:02.715
Yes! Very good.

131
00:07:02.798 --> 00:07:04.508
Now for the real question.

132
00:07:04.592 --> 00:07:07.011
-No!
-But you're doing so well.

133
00:07:07.553 --> 00:07:08.887
We can't stop now.

134
00:07:08.971 --> 00:07:10.514
Stop! Leave us alone.

135
00:07:10.598 --> 00:07:13.267
Then answer the question. Same category.

136
00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:16.437
Oh, please, stop.

137
00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:20.274
Name the killer in Friday the 13th.

138
00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:22.860
Jason! Jason! Jason!

139
00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:25.738
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.

140
00:07:26.572 --> 00:07:29.199
No, it's not! No, it's not. It was Jason!

141
00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:31.827
Afraid not. No way.

142
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.414
Listen. It was Jason.
I saw that movie 20 goddamn times!

143
00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:38.751
Then you should know Jason's mother,
Mrs. Voorhees was the original killer.

144
00:07:38.834 --> 00:07:41.337
Jason didn't show up until the sequel.

145
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.173
I'm afraid that was a wrong answer.

146
00:07:44.256 --> 00:07:45.716
You tricked me.

147
00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:52.014
Lucky for you, there's a bonus round,
but poor Steve. I'm afraid he's out.

148
00:08:17.289 --> 00:08:20.542
Hey, we're not finished yet.

149
00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:24.880
Final question. Are you ready?

150
00:08:27.049 --> 00:08:29.385
Please. Please leave me alone.

151
00:08:29.468 --> 00:08:31.178
Answer the question, and I will.

152
00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:35.849
What door am I at?

153
00:08:36.392 --> 00:08:37.559
What?

154
00:08:37.643 --> 00:08:41.605
There are two main doors fo your house,
a front door and the patio doors.

155
00:08:41.689 --> 00:08:44.441
If you answer correctly, you live.

156
00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:45.776
Very simple.

157
00:08:46.485 --> 00:08:48.487
Don't do this. I can't. I won't

158
00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:51.156
Your call.

159
00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:16.426
Did you water over here today?

160
00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:18.887
No, it was just that water from the rain.

161
00:11:18.971 --> 00:11:20.138
They look great, don't they?

162
00:11:20.222 --> 00:11:21.723
Don't they smell strong?

163
00:11:21.807 --> 00:11:23.183
I told you we could send it back.

164
00:11:26.228 --> 00:11:27.688
Mom.

165
00:11:29.565 --> 00:11:31.108
-Jesus!
-What is it?

166
00:11:44.955 --> 00:11:46.039
Casey!

167
00:11:49.293 --> 00:11:51.086
Oh, God! Oh, God!

168
00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.925
Casey? Casey?

169
00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:58.719
Casey!

170
00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:03.140
-Where is she?
-Call the police.

171
00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:09.396
Casey!

172
00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:11.690
-Casey, you upstairs?
-Oh, my God.

173
00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:13.191
Casey, baby?

174
00:12:13.275 --> 00:12:15.611
-Where is she?
-She's here.

175
00:12:15.694 --> 00:12:18.488
-Mom... Mom...
-Oh, my God. I can hear her.

176
00:12:19.823 --> 00:12:20.991
Where is she?

177
00:12:23.827 --> 00:12:25.203
Oh, my God. I can hear her.

178
00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:31.585
Get in the car.

179
00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:34.338
Drive down to the Mackenzies.

180
00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:36.381
No, not my daughter.

181
00:12:36.465 --> 00:12:38.091
-Just go.
-Not my daughter.

182
00:12:38.175 --> 00:12:39.384
Call the police.

183
00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:25.973
-It's just me.
-Billy, what the-- What're you doing here?

184
00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:27.432
-Sorry. Don't hate me.
-Oh, my God.

185
00:13:27.516 --> 00:13:28.892
What, you sleep in that?

186
00:13:28.976 --> 00:13:32.187
Yes, I sleep in this. My dad is
in the other room. You can't be in here.

187
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.147
-I'll just stay a sec.
-No, you can't--

188
00:13:34.231 --> 00:13:36.358
Oh, no. You gotta go. Go. Go.

189
00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:37.943
What's going on in there?

190
00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:40.570
-Are you okay?
-Can you knock?

191
00:13:40.654 --> 00:13:42.489
-I heard screaming.
-No, you didn't.

192
00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:43.573
No?

193
00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:46.702
Oh, well.

194
00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:50.580
I'm hitting the sack. My flight
leaves first thing in the morning.

195
00:13:50.664 --> 00:13:53.542
Now, the expo runs all weekend,
so I won't be back till Sunday.

196
00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:56.044
There's cash on the table,
and I'm staying at--

197
00:13:56.128 --> 00:13:58.130
-The Hilton.
-Out at the airport, so call if--

198
00:13:58.213 --> 00:14:01.425
-If I need anything. Yeah, I got it.
-I could've sworn I heard screaming.

199
00:14:03.969 --> 00:14:05.387
Have a good trip, okay?

200
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:06.680
Sleep tight, sweetie.

201
00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:13.895
Close call.

202
00:14:13.979 --> 00:14:16.148
Billy, what are you doing here?

203
00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:18.316
Well, it occurred to me that...

204
00:14:19.109 --> 00:14:21.028
I've never snuck through
your bedroom window.

205
00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:23.697
Right, and now
that it's out of your system--

206
00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.699
I was home watching television, and...

207
00:14:26.575 --> 00:14:29.619
The Exorcistwas on.
Got me thinking of you.

208
00:14:31.163 --> 00:14:32.164
It did?

209
00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:34.708
Yeah. It was edited for TV.

210
00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:36.793
You know, all the good stuff
was cut out and...

211
00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:39.463
it got me thinking of us.

212
00:14:41.048 --> 00:14:43.675
How two years ago,
we started off hot and heavy.

213
00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:48.096
Nice, solid R rating,
on our way to an NC-17.

214
00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:53.060
And how things have changed, and...

215
00:14:58.732 --> 00:15:01.568
Lately, we're just
sort of edited for television.

216
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.031
So, you thought
you would climb in my window,

217
00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:08.575
and we'd have a little raw footage?

218
00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:11.578
No, no. I wouldn't dream
of breaking your underwear rule.

219
00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:15.290
I just...

220
00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:18.460
I thought maybe we could do
a little on top of the clothes stuff.

221
00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:22.547
Okay.

222
00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:25.425
Yeah?

223
00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:27.177
Yeah.

224
00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:42.692
Hey.

225
00:15:57.999 --> 00:16:01.211
Okay. Okay, okay. Time's up, stud bucket.

226
00:16:02.546 --> 00:16:04.172
You see what you do to me?

227
00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:07.717
You know what my dad will do to you?

228
00:16:09.052 --> 00:16:10.053
Yeah.

229
00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:13.140
-I'm going.
-Okay.

230
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.271
Bye.

231
00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:25.193
You know,
I appreciate the romantic gesture.

232
00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:30.949
Hey, about the sex stuff?

233
00:16:31.575 --> 00:16:33.827
You know,
I'm not trying to rush you at all.

234
00:16:34.411 --> 00:16:35.745
I was only half-serious.

235
00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:38.832
Okay.

236
00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:48.717
Hey, Billy.

237
00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:53.054
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?

238
00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:54.931
What's that?

239
00:17:01.438 --> 00:17:04.691
My God. You're just a tease.

240
00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:17.120
35-14... Situation under control.

241
00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:20.415
Roger, dispatch. 35, I copy.

242
00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:24.377
All right.

243
00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:42.354
...are dealing drugs,
that they are high in the classrooms,

244
00:17:42.437 --> 00:17:44.397
and that they are involved in the occult.

245
00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:45.482
Occult?

246
00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:50.278
The small town of Woodsboro, California
was devastated last night

247
00:17:50.362 --> 00:17:53.156
when two young teenagers
were found brutally murdered.

248
00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.743
Authorities have yet to issue a statement,
but our sources tell us

249
00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:59.496
that no arrest has been made,
and the murderer could strike again...

250
00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:02.415
-Do you believe this shit?
-Tatum, what is going on?

251
00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:03.833
-You don't know?
-No.

252
00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:07.629
Casey Becker and Steve Orth
were killed last night.

253
00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:09.047
What? No way.

254
00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.133
And we're not just talking killed,
we're talking splatter-movie killed,

255
00:18:12.217 --> 00:18:14.386
ripped open from end to end.

256
00:18:14.469 --> 00:18:16.972
Casey Becker?
She sits next to me in English.

257
00:18:17.055 --> 00:18:18.181
Not anymore.

258
00:18:18.265 --> 00:18:21.351
It's so sad. Her mom and dad
found her hanging from a tree,

259
00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:22.727
her insides on the outside.

260
00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:25.772
Oh, my God. Do they know who did it?

261
00:18:26.481 --> 00:18:29.484
Fucking clueless. I mean,
they're interrogating the entire school,

262
00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:30.902
teachers, students, janitors.

263
00:18:30.986 --> 00:18:33.321
-They think it's school-related?
-They don't know.

264
00:18:33.405 --> 00:18:36.950
Dewey was saying this is the worst crime
they've seen in years, even worse than--

265
00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:39.327
Well...

266
00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.162
It's bad.

267
00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:48.420
-Here you go, Mrs. Taylor.
-Thank you, Jimmy.

268
00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:53.383
Sidney?

269
00:18:54.843 --> 00:18:57.095
It would appear to be your turn.

270
00:19:00.724 --> 00:19:02.058
Who's up next?

271
00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:03.351
-Sidney Prescott.
-Prescott.

272
00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:06.062
She was daughter of...

273
00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:11.151
-Sidney. Thank you.
-Okay.

274
00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:12.319
Hi, Sidney.

275
00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:14.988
Sheriff Burke. Dewey.

276
00:19:15.864 --> 00:19:17.949
That's Deputy Riley today, Sid.

277
00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:21.119
How is everything?

278
00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:22.203
Good.

279
00:19:22.287 --> 00:19:24.372
And your dad? How's he doing?

280
00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:26.291
We're fine, thanks.

281
00:19:26.374 --> 00:19:28.293
We're gonna keep this very brief, Sidney.

282
00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:31.087
The police just wanna ask you
a few questions. You okay?

283
00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:35.383
Sidney, were you very close
to Casey Becker?

284
00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:39.471
Remember, your principal loves you,
and I want you to be safe.

285
00:19:39.554 --> 00:19:43.224
All students are encouraged fo return to
their homes promptly from school grounds.

286
00:19:43.308 --> 00:19:45.143
Avoid strangers
and walk in twos and threes...

287
00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:48.438
-How many questions did they ask you, Sid?
-Well, they asked me if I knew Casey.

288
00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:51.316
-Yeah, they asked me that, too.
-Hey, did they ask if you like to hunt?

289
00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:53.026
Yeah, they did. They ask you?

290
00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:56.196
Hunt? Why would they ask you
if you like to hunt?

291
00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:57.906
Because their bodies were gutted.

292
00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:00.367
Thank you, Randy.

293
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.993
They didn't ask me if I liked to hunt.

294
00:20:02.077 --> 00:20:04.120
That's â€˜cause there's no way
a girl could've killed them.

295
00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:05.205
That is so sexist.

296
00:20:05.288 --> 00:20:07.832
The killer could easily be female.
Basic Instinct?

297
00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:10.251
That was an ice pick.
Not exactly the same thing.

298
00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:12.879
Yeah, Casey and Steve
were completely hollowed out.

299
00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:16.007
And the fact is, it takes a man
to do something like that.

300
00:20:16.091 --> 00:20:17.467
Or a man's mentality.

301
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.011
How do you gut someone?

302
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.058
You take a knife...

303
00:20:25.892 --> 00:20:28.770
and you slit them from groin to sternum.

304
00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:31.523
Hey, it's called tact, you fuckrag.

305
00:20:32.315 --> 00:20:34.651
Hey, Stu, didn't you used to date Casey?

306
00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:36.903
Yeah, for, like, two seconds.

307
00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:38.905
Before she dumped him for Steve.

308
00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:41.574
-I thought you dumped her for me?
-I did. He's full of shit.

309
00:20:41.658 --> 00:20:43.451
Are the police aware
that you dated the victim?

310
00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:46.663
Hey, what are you saying?
That I killed her?

311
00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:48.706
It would certainly improve
your high school "Q."

312
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.418
Stu was with me last night. Okay?

313
00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:52.627
Yeah, I was.

314
00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.256
Was that before or after
he sliced and diced?

315
00:20:56.339 --> 00:20:58.383
Fuck you, nutcase.
Where were you last night?

316
00:20:58.466 --> 00:20:59.926
Working, thank you.

317
00:21:00.009 --> 00:21:02.303
At the video store?
I thought they fired your sorry ass.

318
00:21:02.387 --> 00:21:03.471
Twice.

319
00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:06.599
I didn't kill anybody.

320
00:21:06.683 --> 00:21:08.268
Nobody said you did.

321
00:21:09.018 --> 00:21:10.019
Thanks, buddy.

322
00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:15.150
Besides, it takes a man
to do something like that.

323
00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:17.610
Yo, I'm gonna gut your ass
in a second, kid.

324
00:21:17.694 --> 00:21:20.822
Tell me something, did you really put
her liver in the mailbox?

325
00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:23.116
â€˜Cause I heard that they found her liver
in the mailbox

326
00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:24.784
next to her spleen and her pancreas.

327
00:21:24.868 --> 00:21:27.412
Randy, you goon-fuck,
I'm trying to eat here.

328
00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:29.038
She's getting mad, Randy.

329
00:21:29.581 --> 00:21:31.082
You better "liver" alone.

330
00:21:33.877 --> 00:21:35.420
Liver alone!

331
00:21:40.717 --> 00:21:43.136
Liver, liver! Live? It was a joke.

332
00:21:49.058 --> 00:21:50.268
See you, Sidney.

333
00:21:50.351 --> 00:21:51.769
I'll talk to you tomorrow, Sid.

334
00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:18.630
So you sure I can stay over?
â€˜Cause my dad won't be back till Sunday.

335
00:22:19.172 --> 00:22:21.174
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.

336
00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:24.052
You okay?

337
00:22:26.346 --> 00:22:28.890
It's just, you know,
the police and reporters and everything,

338
00:22:28.973 --> 00:22:31.184
it's like dÃ©ja vu all over again.

339
00:22:31.267 --> 00:22:33.645
I'll be there by 7:00, I promise.

340
00:22:33.728 --> 00:22:35.563
-Thanks, Tatum.
-Later.

341
00:23:23.945 --> 00:23:27.657
...the bodies of 17-year-old Casey Becker
and her 18-year-old boyfriend Steven Orth

342
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.784
were discovered late last night
by the girl's--

343
00:23:29.867 --> 00:23:31.786
The Woodsboro double-murder case.

344
00:23:31.869 --> 00:23:34.622
Authorities are baffled
by the lack of clues and the savage--

345
00:23:35.456 --> 00:23:38.459
The fown's in shock, and no one
can quite believe what has happened here.

346
00:23:39.085 --> 00:23:42.046
Although this is not the first time
this small community of Woodsboro

347
00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:43.965
has endured such tragedy.

348
00:23:44.048 --> 00:23:46.968
Only a year ago, Maureen Prescott,
wife and mother,

349
00:23:47.051 --> 00:23:50.805
was found raped and murdered
not far from this peaceful town square.

350
00:25:01.668 --> 00:25:02.752
Hello?

351
00:25:02.835 --> 00:25:04.879
Practice ran late. I'm on my way, okay?

352
00:25:07.548 --> 00:25:09.050
It's past 7:00.

353
00:25:09.133 --> 00:25:11.761
Don't worry. Casey and Steve
didn't bite it till way after 10:00.

354
00:25:13.554 --> 00:25:15.098
That's comforting.

355
00:25:15.181 --> 00:25:16.891
I'm gonna swing by the video store.

356
00:25:16.974 --> 00:25:19.060
I was thinking Tom Cruise
In All the Right Moves.

357
00:25:19.143 --> 00:25:21.854
You know, if you pause it just right,
you can see his penis.

358
00:25:21.938 --> 00:25:23.773
Whatever. Just hurry, okay?

359
00:25:23.856 --> 00:25:25.066
Ta-ta, Sid.

360
00:25:35.952 --> 00:25:37.412
Tatum, just get in the car--

361
00:25:37.495 --> 00:25:38.621
Hello, Sidney.

362
00:25:42.458 --> 00:25:44.001
Hi. Who is this?

363
00:25:44.085 --> 00:25:45.211
You fell me.

364
00:25:48.381 --> 00:25:50.383
Well, I have no idea.

365
00:25:50.466 --> 00:25:52.135
Scary night, isn't it?

366
00:25:52.218 --> 00:25:56.472
With the murders and all, it's like
right out of a horror movie or something.

367
00:25:58.015 --> 00:25:59.517
Randy, you gave yourself away.

368
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.186
Are you calling from work?
â€˜Cause Tatum's on her way over.

369
00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:05.273
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?

370
00:26:05.356 --> 00:26:07.525
I like that thing you're doing
with your voice, Randy.

371
00:26:07.608 --> 00:26:08.901
It's sexy.

372
00:26:08.985 --> 00:26:11.487
What's your favorite scary movie?

373
00:26:11.571 --> 00:26:13.406
Oh, come on.
You know I don't watch that shit.

374
00:26:13.489 --> 00:26:15.450
Why not? Too scared?

375
00:26:15.533 --> 00:26:18.411
No. No. It's just, what's the point?
They're all the same.

376
00:26:18.494 --> 00:26:21.414
Some stupid killer stalking some
big-breasted girl who can't act,

377
00:26:21.497 --> 00:26:22.749
who's always running up the stairs

378
00:26:22.832 --> 00:26:25.001
when she should be going out
the front door. It's insulting.

379
00:26:25.501 --> 00:26:28.463
Are you alone in the house?

380
00:26:28.546 --> 00:26:31.382
Randy, that's so unoriginal.
I'm disappointed in you.

381
00:26:31.466 --> 00:26:34.635
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.

382
00:26:42.477 --> 00:26:43.811
So, who are you?

383
00:26:43.895 --> 00:26:49.233
The question isn't, "Who am I?"
The question is, "Where am I?"

384
00:26:50.985 --> 00:26:53.404
So, where are you?

385
00:26:53.488 --> 00:26:55.239
Your front porch.

386
00:26:59.744 --> 00:27:02.246
Why would you be calling
from my front porch?

387
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:04.248
That's the original part.

388
00:27:06.417 --> 00:27:07.460
Oh, yeah?

389
00:27:11.756 --> 00:27:12.965
Well, I call your bluff.

390
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.688
So where are you?

391
00:27:27.772 --> 00:27:29.106
Right here.

392
00:28:02.139 --> 00:28:03.474
Can you see me right now?

393
00:28:05.226 --> 00:28:07.395
Okay. What am I doing?

394
00:28:10.273 --> 00:28:12.608
What am I doing? Hello?

395
00:28:15.027 --> 00:28:16.070
Nice try, Randy.

396
00:28:16.153 --> 00:28:18.406
Tell Tatum to hurry up, okay? Bye, now.

397
00:28:18.489 --> 00:28:21.158
If you hang up on me,
you'll die, just like your mother!

398
00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:25.621
Do you want to die, Sidney?

399
00:28:25.705 --> 00:28:27.957
Your mother sure didn't.

400
00:28:29.292 --> 00:28:31.002
Fuck you, you cretin.

401
00:29:00.573 --> 00:29:02.158
No!

402
00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:30.061
Come on.

403
00:29:32.188 --> 00:29:33.230
Shit!

404
00:29:49.288 --> 00:29:50.915
Billy!

405
00:29:50.998 --> 00:29:53.167
Door's locked.
I heard screaming. You all right?

406
00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:55.294
The killer's here. He's in the house.

407
00:29:55.378 --> 00:29:58.130
No, he's in the house.
He's gonna... He's gonna kill us.

408
00:29:58.214 --> 00:29:59.507
He's gone.

409
00:30:00.174 --> 00:30:01.175
He's gone.

410
00:30:01.676 --> 00:30:02.802
It's all right.

411
00:30:13.729 --> 00:30:14.730
What?

412
00:30:18.859 --> 00:30:19.860
Sid, what?

413
00:30:23.197 --> 00:30:24.198
Wait, wait, wait!

414
00:30:24.281 --> 00:30:26.158
Sidney, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

415
00:30:26.242 --> 00:30:28.577
Come on! Sidney, come back!

416
00:30:29.245 --> 00:30:30.371
Sidney!

417
00:30:35.292 --> 00:30:37.586
Sorry. I found this.

418
00:30:38.421 --> 00:30:39.755
Come on!

419
00:30:39.839 --> 00:30:41.173
All right, hold your hands together!

420
00:30:41.257 --> 00:30:43.426
Do you wish to give up
your right to remain silent?

421
00:30:43.509 --> 00:30:44.635
I didn't do anything.

422
00:30:44.719 --> 00:30:46.971
Do you wish to give up
your right to speak to an attorney

423
00:30:47.054 --> 00:30:48.764
and have him present during questioning?

424
00:30:48.848 --> 00:30:50.141
Ask her. She'll tell you.

425
00:30:51.017 --> 00:30:52.935
-Ask her.
-What have you got, Dewey?

426
00:30:53.019 --> 00:30:54.186
-I caught him, Sheriff.
-Wait!

427
00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:55.938
-Who is that?
-Billy Loomis.

428
00:30:56.022 --> 00:30:59.233
Sir... Sheriff, call these guys off.
I didn't do it.

429
00:31:00.985 --> 00:31:03.738
Sheriff, wait, wait. Listen. Call my dad.

430
00:31:03.821 --> 00:31:06.490
Please call him.
He'll tell you. Just call him.

431
00:31:06.574 --> 00:31:09.535
Sidney! Sidney!

432
00:31:09.618 --> 00:31:11.662
-How's she doing?
-Sid's tougher than she looks.

433
00:31:12.538 --> 00:31:14.582
You'd have to be,
all the shit she's been through.

434
00:31:14.665 --> 00:31:16.042
Sid!

435
00:31:16.709 --> 00:31:18.836
Well, we're seeing a lot of you today.

436
00:31:19.712 --> 00:31:22.631
You gonna be able to come to the station
and answer a few questions, Sid?

437
00:31:22.715 --> 00:31:24.050
Oh, shit. Sidney!

438
00:31:24.133 --> 00:31:26.218
God, Sid, I'm so sorry I was late.
Are you all right?

439
00:31:26.302 --> 00:31:28.471
Tatum, you can't be here.
This is an official crime scene.

440
00:31:28.554 --> 00:31:29.722
It's okay.

441
00:31:29.805 --> 00:31:32.349
Her dad's out of town, all right?
She's staying with us tonight.

442
00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:35.352
-Does Mom know?
-Yes, doofus.

443
00:31:35.436 --> 00:31:37.563
-Let's get you out of here.
-She'll be okay.

444
00:31:38.272 --> 00:31:40.441
-Come on, Sid.
-You won't believe this.

445
00:31:40.524 --> 00:31:41.567
What?

446
00:31:44.653 --> 00:31:45.780
Creepy, huh?

447
00:31:55.206 --> 00:31:56.457
-I'll be damned.
-What?

448
00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.250
Jesus, the camera! Hurry!

449
00:31:58.334 --> 00:31:59.877
My name isn't Jesus.

450
00:32:02.254 --> 00:32:03.798
Sidney, is that you in there?

451
00:32:03.881 --> 00:32:05.841
Excuse me, is that Sidney Prescott
they took away?

452
00:32:05.925 --> 00:32:07.093
I'm not talking to you.

453
00:32:07.176 --> 00:32:09.261
-What happened to her?
-None of your damn business.

454
00:32:09.345 --> 00:32:11.806
I heard something about a costume.
Is that true?

455
00:32:11.889 --> 00:32:13.599
Can you tell me anything?

456
00:32:13.682 --> 00:32:17.103
Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass.
Leave Sid alone.

457
00:32:18.145 --> 00:32:19.271
Where's she going?

458
00:32:21.232 --> 00:32:23.734
-Look... Kenny?
-Yeah?

459
00:32:23.818 --> 00:32:26.445
I know that you're about
50 pounds overweight,

460
00:32:26.529 --> 00:32:28.239
but when I say hurry,

461
00:32:28.322 --> 00:32:32.868
please interpret that as
move your fat, tub-of-lard ass now!

462
00:32:36.539 --> 00:32:37.623
Did you find him?

463
00:32:39.125 --> 00:32:40.459
You're sure it was the Hilton?

464
00:32:41.043 --> 00:32:42.169
At the airport.

465
00:32:44.296 --> 00:32:45.631
He's not registered there.

466
00:32:47.508 --> 00:32:49.135
Could he have stayed somewhere else?

467
00:32:50.219 --> 00:32:52.263
I don't know. I guess.

468
00:32:54.557 --> 00:32:55.558
Don't worry, Sid.

469
00:32:56.267 --> 00:32:57.393
We'll find him.

470
00:32:57.476 --> 00:32:58.853
Dewey, they got that mask in.

471
00:33:00.146 --> 00:33:02.189
-Roger, dispatch.
-I'll be right back.

472
00:33:10.406 --> 00:33:12.032
Let me ask you this,

473
00:33:12.116 --> 00:33:14.410
what are you doing
with a cellular telephone, Son?

474
00:33:15.286 --> 00:33:16.954
Everybody's got one, Sheriff.

475
00:33:17.997 --> 00:33:19.999
I didn't make those calls. I swear.

476
00:33:20.082 --> 00:33:23.127
Why don't you check the phone bill,
for Christ's sake. Call Vital Phone Comp.

477
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:26.547
-They got records of every number dialed.
-Thanks, Hank. We're on top of it.

478
00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:30.301
What were you doing over
at Sidney's house tonight?

479
00:33:31.218 --> 00:33:32.887
I wanted to see her, that's all.

480
00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:36.724
And last night? Sidney said you crawled
through her window last night, too.

481
00:33:36.807 --> 00:33:38.142
You went out last night?

482
00:33:40.019 --> 00:33:43.772
I was watching TV. I got bored.
I decided to go for a ride.

483
00:33:43.856 --> 00:33:45.649
You happen to ride by
Casey Becker's house?

484
00:33:45.733 --> 00:33:48.485
No. No, I didn't.

485
00:33:48.569 --> 00:33:50.779
Sheriff, I didn't kill anybody.

486
00:33:56.118 --> 00:33:59.205
We're gonna have to hold you, Son,
till we get those phone records.

487
00:34:02.458 --> 00:34:03.667
This is crazy.

488
00:34:05.336 --> 00:34:07.755
You know that? I didn't do it.

489
00:34:19.225 --> 00:34:20.559
-Camera two!
-No, I do!

490
00:34:20.643 --> 00:34:21.727
-Okay!
-Yeah.

491
00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:23.437
Are there any more donuts in there?

492
00:34:24.188 --> 00:34:25.397
Move it, Kenny.

493
00:34:25.481 --> 00:34:27.858
-They're not letting anybody in.
-I'm not just anyone.

494
00:34:28.609 --> 00:34:29.610
Bitch goddess.

495
00:34:29.693 --> 00:34:31.362
-Kenny, are we on?
-Yeah, go.

496
00:34:31.445 --> 00:34:34.281
Hi. Gale Weathers reporting live
from the Woodsboro Police Station,

497
00:34:34.365 --> 00:34:36.617
where we hope to get a glimpse
of Sidney Prescott.

498
00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:37.785
Hey, watch her, Larry!

499
00:34:37.868 --> 00:34:40.204
Hey, watch the hand.
You know who you're dealing with here?

500
00:34:40.287 --> 00:34:43.290
Tell them. Come on, Dad. Tell them.

501
00:34:43.874 --> 00:34:45.668
-Sidney--
-Just wait for the lawyer, Billy.

502
00:34:45.751 --> 00:34:48.003
-Sidney, come on. You know me.
-Come on, come on.

503
00:34:48.087 --> 00:34:50.256
-Sidney, look at me!
-Don't give us any trouble.

504
00:34:50.923 --> 00:34:51.924
Come on!

505
00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:01.433
Sid, I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?
You okay?

506
00:35:03.602 --> 00:35:06.939
They sell this costume
in every five-and-dime in the state.

507
00:35:07.022 --> 00:35:09.066
There's no way to track the purchase.

508
00:35:10.359 --> 00:35:12.027
What about that cellular phone bill?

509
00:35:12.111 --> 00:35:14.196
Well, we're pulling Loomis's account.

510
00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:16.282
We won't know anything until the morning.

511
00:35:16.365 --> 00:35:17.449
Oh, come on!

512
00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:20.452
You think he did it?

513
00:35:20.536 --> 00:35:23.539
Twenty years ago,
I would've said not a chance.

514
00:35:23.622 --> 00:35:25.374
But these kids today...

515
00:35:26.917 --> 00:35:28.002
damned if I know.

516
00:35:28.085 --> 00:35:29.837
Hey, Dewey, can we go now?

517
00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.297
Hold on a second.

518
00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.048
Goddamn it, Dewey!

519
00:35:33.674 --> 00:35:35.009
What did Mom tell you?

520
00:35:35.092 --> 00:35:37.428
When I wear this badge,
you treat me like a man of the law.

521
00:35:37.511 --> 00:35:41.223
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey boy,
but we're ready to go. Now, okay?

522
00:35:43.225 --> 00:35:45.728
Take them out the back way.
Avoid that circus out there.

523
00:35:46.437 --> 00:35:47.563
Go on, big brother.

524
00:35:47.646 --> 00:35:49.231
-Come on.
-Don't touch me.

525
00:35:50.024 --> 00:35:51.150
He's my superior.

526
00:35:51.233 --> 00:35:52.985
The janitor's your superior.

527
00:35:56.071 --> 00:35:57.614
Let's get back to work!

528
00:36:03.746 --> 00:36:05.789
Isn't there a back way out of this place?

529
00:36:05.873 --> 00:36:07.791
Yeah. Down that alley, I think.

530
00:36:12.212 --> 00:36:14.131
You guys just stay here.
I'm gonna get the car.

531
00:36:14.214 --> 00:36:15.716
Don't move. Don't make a sound.

532
00:36:18.552 --> 00:36:20.220
There she is. Sidney!

533
00:36:21.555 --> 00:36:24.475
Hi. Some night. What happened?
Are you all right?

534
00:36:24.558 --> 00:36:26.602
She's not answering any questions.
Leave us alone.

535
00:36:26.685 --> 00:36:29.438
No. No, Tatum. It's okay.
She's just doing her job, right, Gale?

536
00:36:29.521 --> 00:36:31.148
Yes, that's right.

537
00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:32.941
So how's the book?

538
00:36:33.525 --> 00:36:34.985
Well, it'll be out later this year.

539
00:36:36.195 --> 00:36:37.363
I'll look for it.

540
00:36:37.446 --> 00:36:38.989
I'll send you a copy.

541
00:36:41.158 --> 00:36:42.159
Geez.

542
00:36:43.744 --> 00:36:45.162
-Nice shot.
-Bitch.

543
00:36:45.245 --> 00:36:48.374
-No, I mean, the camera. Nice shot.
-Where'd you learn to punch like that?

544
00:36:48.999 --> 00:36:53.170
God, I loved it. "I'll send you a copy."
Bam! Bitch went down.

545
00:36:53.879 --> 00:36:59.343
"I'll send you a copy." Bam!
Sid, superbitch! You are so cool.

546
00:36:59.426 --> 00:37:01.553
Thought you might want some ice
for that right hook.

547
00:37:02.596 --> 00:37:03.597
Thanks.

548
00:37:04.348 --> 00:37:07.518
I'll be right next door.
Try to get some sleep.

549
00:37:07.601 --> 00:37:08.727
Yeah, yeah.

550
00:37:14.942 --> 00:37:16.610
Do you really think Billy did it?

551
00:37:18.195 --> 00:37:19.363
He was there, Tatum.

552
00:37:21.365 --> 00:37:24.451
He was destined to have a flaw.
I knew he was too perfect.

553
00:37:26.912 --> 00:37:27.913
Telephone, honey.

554
00:37:27.996 --> 00:37:29.706
-Who is it?
-It's for Sid.

555
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:30.791
My dad?

556
00:37:31.375 --> 00:37:32.835
I don't think so.

557
00:37:32.918 --> 00:37:35.629
-Take a message.
-No. I'll get it.

558
00:37:39.967 --> 00:37:41.176
How's she doing?

559
00:37:45.055 --> 00:37:46.098
Hello?

560
00:37:46.181 --> 00:37:48.225
Hello, Sidney.

561
00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:50.686
No!

562
00:37:50.769 --> 00:37:52.813
Poor Billy boyfriend.

563
00:37:52.896 --> 00:37:55.482
An innocent guy
doesn't stand a chance with you.

564
00:37:55.566 --> 00:37:56.817
Leave me alone!

565
00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.069
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy...

566
00:37:59.153 --> 00:38:00.279
-Dewey!
-...again.

567
00:38:00.362 --> 00:38:01.738
-Who are you?
-Dewey!

568
00:38:01.822 --> 00:38:05.576
-Hang up, Sid.
-Don't worry. You'll find out soon enough.

569
00:38:05.659 --> 00:38:07.244
-/ promise.
-Dewey!

570
00:38:10.205 --> 00:38:11.248
What?

571
00:38:14.126 --> 00:38:15.836
-"What?"
-What?

572
00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.801
Hello?

573
00:38:33.979 --> 00:38:37.858
Sidney Prescott, who escaped
a vicious attack last night,

574
00:38:37.941 --> 00:38:41.487
Is the daughter of Maureen Prescott,
who was brutally killed last year

575
00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:44.406
when convicted murderer Cotton Weary
broke info their home

576
00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:46.825
and savagely raped and tortured
the deceased.

577
00:38:47.534 --> 00:38:50.913
Cotton Weary is currently awaiting appeal
for the death sentence handed down

578
00:38:50.996 --> 00:38:53.624
after the young Sidney
testified against him.

579
00:38:53.707 --> 00:38:56.335
She was the key witness
in the state's case against the--

580
00:38:59.046 --> 00:39:01.215
It's never gonna stop, is it?

581
00:39:02.591 --> 00:39:04.009
Billy was released.

582
00:39:05.219 --> 00:39:08.639
His cellular bill was clean.
He didn't make those calls.

583
00:39:08.722 --> 00:39:11.517
We're checking every cellular account
in the county.

584
00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:15.103
Any calls made to you or Casey Becker
are being cross-referenced.

585
00:39:15.812 --> 00:39:18.398
It's gonna take some time,
but we'll find him.

586
00:39:20.192 --> 00:39:21.193
Okay?

587
00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:40.254
Don't worry, Sid. It's school.
You'll be safe here.

588
00:39:40.963 --> 00:39:43.006
How does it feel
to be almost brutally butchered?

589
00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:44.424
Hey! Hey, now, leave her alone.

590
00:39:44.508 --> 00:39:46.385
People want to know!
They have a right to know!

591
00:39:46.468 --> 00:39:48.136
-Leave her alone.
-How does it feel?

592
00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:51.014
She just wants to get an education.
Turn that thing off.

593
00:39:52.849 --> 00:39:53.934
What?

594
00:39:56.228 --> 00:39:57.229
Just a sec.

595
00:40:08.407 --> 00:40:09.533
Stop right there.

596
00:40:09.616 --> 00:40:11.910
I'm not here to fight.
I just need to talk.

597
00:40:11.994 --> 00:40:13.787
Kenny, camera, now.

598
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:15.622
-Off the record. No cameras.
-Forget it.

599
00:40:15.706 --> 00:40:17.749
Please? You owe me.

600
00:40:17.833 --> 00:40:19.042
I owe you shit.

601
00:40:19.126 --> 00:40:20.294
You owe my mother!

602
00:40:23.005 --> 00:40:26.049
Your mother's murder
was last year's hottest court case.

603
00:40:26.133 --> 00:40:27.759
Somebody was gonna write a book about it.

604
00:40:27.843 --> 00:40:30.178
Right. It had to be you
with your lies and bullshit theories.

605
00:40:30.262 --> 00:40:33.056
What is your problem?
You got what you wanted.

606
00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:35.684
Cotton Weary's in jail.
They're gonna gas him.

607
00:40:35.767 --> 00:40:37.352
A book is not gonna change that.

608
00:40:41.398 --> 00:40:43.900
-Do you still think he's innocent?
-Your testimony put him away.

609
00:40:43.984 --> 00:40:45.485
It doesn't really matter what I think.

610
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:49.531
During the trial, you did all those
stories about me. You called me a liar.

611
00:40:49.615 --> 00:40:51.783
I think you falsely identified him, yes.

612
00:40:52.868 --> 00:40:54.953
-Have you talked to Cotton?
-Many times.

613
00:40:56.121 --> 00:40:58.498
-And has his story changed?
-Not one word.

614
00:40:59.333 --> 00:41:02.044
He admits to having sex with your mother,
but that's all.

615
00:41:02.127 --> 00:41:04.630
He's lying.
She never would've touched him.

616
00:41:04.713 --> 00:41:06.506
He raped her, and then...

617
00:41:07.591 --> 00:41:09.801
he butchered her.
Her blood was all over his coat.

618
00:41:09.885 --> 00:41:11.178
He was drunk that night.

619
00:41:11.803 --> 00:41:14.598
He left his coat at your house
after your mother seduced him.

620
00:41:14.681 --> 00:41:16.183
I saw him leave wearing it.

621
00:41:16.266 --> 00:41:18.852
No, you saw someone leave
wearing that coat,

622
00:41:19.686 --> 00:41:23.231
the same someone who planted it
in Cotton's car, framing him.

623
00:41:25.651 --> 00:41:26.652
No.

624
00:41:27.527 --> 00:41:29.071
Cotton murdered my mother.

625
00:41:31.823 --> 00:41:33.492
You're not so sure anymore, are you?

626
00:41:35.243 --> 00:41:38.163
Nice welt, sweetie. Let's go, Sid.

627
00:41:38.955 --> 00:41:40.832
The killer's still on the loose, isn't he?

628
00:41:40.916 --> 00:41:41.958
Come on, Sid.

629
00:41:42.042 --> 00:41:43.335
Those murders are related.

630
00:41:44.586 --> 00:41:46.213
I'm sorry I mangled your face.

631
00:41:46.296 --> 00:41:47.464
Wait. Sidney, don't go.

632
00:41:47.547 --> 00:41:49.383
Just stop, all right?

633
00:41:55.347 --> 00:41:56.848
Jesus Christ.

634
00:41:56.932 --> 00:41:59.893
An innocent man on death row.
A killer still on the loose.

635
00:41:59.976 --> 00:42:01.103
Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.

636
00:42:01.186 --> 00:42:02.938
-You want to go live?
-No, no. Not so fast.

637
00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:06.274
-We don't have anything concrete.
-This is huge. You can't just sit on it.

638
00:42:06.358 --> 00:42:08.902
I know. That's why we need proof.

639
00:42:09.611 --> 00:42:12.489
If I'm right about this,
I could save a man's life.

640
00:42:13.657 --> 00:42:15.617
Do you know what that
could do for my book sales?

641
00:42:17.077 --> 00:42:19.538
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.

642
00:42:20.747 --> 00:42:22.999
I want you to meet me
right here after class. Okay, Sid?

643
00:42:24.292 --> 00:42:25.335
All right.

644
00:42:26.795 --> 00:42:31.007
Hey, I haven't seen Billy around.
Is he really pissed?

645
00:42:31.091 --> 00:42:33.468
You mean after you branded him
the Candy Man?

646
00:42:33.552 --> 00:42:35.262
-No. His heart's broken.
-Stul

647
00:42:44.938 --> 00:42:46.356
Why are they doing this?

648
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:50.068
Are you kidding me?
Look at this place. It's like Christmas.

649
00:42:50.152 --> 00:42:52.863
-Stupidity leak!
-Easy!

650
00:42:52.946 --> 00:42:54.030
Sidney!

651
00:42:56.283 --> 00:42:57.409
Jesus! Shit!

652
00:42:58.326 --> 00:42:59.411
It's just me.

653
00:43:02.873 --> 00:43:04.249
You still think it's me.

654
00:43:04.332 --> 00:43:06.752
No. No, I don't.

655
00:43:06.835 --> 00:43:09.629
It's just... somebody was there...

656
00:43:09.713 --> 00:43:10.839
Hey, Christie, wait up.

657
00:43:10.922 --> 00:43:12.340
Billy, someone tried to kill me.

658
00:43:12.424 --> 00:43:14.801
I know. I know.
The cops said I scared them away.

659
00:43:14.885 --> 00:43:16.344
It wasn't me, Sid.

660
00:43:17.429 --> 00:43:20.807
I know. He called me again last night
at Tatum's house.

661
00:43:20.891 --> 00:43:24.644
You see? Couldn't have been me.
I was in jail. Remember?

662
00:43:27.647 --> 00:43:30.567
I'm so... sorry. Please understand.

663
00:43:31.276 --> 00:43:32.486
Understand what?

664
00:43:33.153 --> 00:43:35.280
That I have a girlfriend
who would rather accuse me

665
00:43:35.363 --> 00:43:37.908
of being a psychopathic killer
than touch me?

666
00:43:39.993 --> 00:43:41.119
You know that's not true.

667
00:43:41.203 --> 00:43:42.245
Then what is it?

668
00:43:42.329 --> 00:43:44.331
What... is it?

669
00:43:44.414 --> 00:43:46.833
Billy, I was attacked
and nearly filleted last night.

670
00:43:46.917 --> 00:43:48.126
I mean between us.

671
00:43:49.044 --> 00:43:50.921
I mean, you haven't been the same since...

672
00:43:53.757 --> 00:43:54.758
since your mother died.

673
00:43:54.841 --> 00:43:58.553
Is your brain leaking? My mom was killed.
I can't believe you're bringing this up!

674
00:43:58.637 --> 00:43:59.971
No, it's been a year.

675
00:44:00.055 --> 00:44:02.307
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.

676
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:04.351
I know. I think it's time
you got over that.

677
00:44:04.434 --> 00:44:07.354
I mean, when my mom left my dad,
I accepted it.

678
00:44:07.437 --> 00:44:10.190
It's the way it is. She's not coming back.

679
00:44:10.273 --> 00:44:13.443
Your parents split up.
This is not the same thing.

680
00:44:13.527 --> 00:44:15.904
Your mom left town.
She's not lying in a coffin somewhere.

681
00:44:15.987 --> 00:44:19.491
Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.
It's... it's a bad analogy.

682
00:44:20.659 --> 00:44:21.827
It's just that...

683
00:44:23.078 --> 00:44:24.913
I want my girlfriend back.

684
00:44:27.999 --> 00:44:29.125
Sid!

685
00:44:29.209 --> 00:44:31.086
I am sorry if my traumatized life

686
00:44:31.169 --> 00:44:34.130
is an inconvenience to you
and your perfect existence.

687
00:44:34.214 --> 00:44:37.384
What? What are you--
Nobody said that! Sid!

688
00:44:39.427 --> 00:44:41.054
Stupid.

689
00:44:41.137 --> 00:44:43.390
You make me so sick.

690
00:44:43.473 --> 00:44:47.936
Your entire havoc-inducing, thieving,
whoring generation disgusts me.

691
00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:54.609
So, two of your fellow students
were just savagely murdered,

692
00:44:54.693 --> 00:44:57.404
and this is the way that you show
your compassion and sensitivity, huh?

693
00:44:57.487 --> 00:44:58.864
Let me tell you something...

694
00:44:59.865 --> 00:45:01.324
You're both expelled. Get out!

695
00:45:02.409 --> 00:45:05.370
-Come on, Mr. Himbry! It was just a joke!
-That's not fair!

696
00:45:10.125 --> 00:45:12.502
You're absolutely right. It is not fair.

697
00:45:12.586 --> 00:45:17.132
Fairness would be to rip your insides out,
hang you from a tree so we can expose you

698
00:45:17.215 --> 00:45:20.176
for the heartless,
desensitized little shits that you are.

699
00:45:32.564 --> 00:45:35.191
She was never attacked.
I think she made it all up.

700
00:45:35.275 --> 00:45:36.526
Why would she lie about it?

701
00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:39.237
For attention.
The girl has some serious issues.

702
00:45:45.994 --> 00:45:48.079
What if she did it?

703
00:45:48.163 --> 00:45:50.457
What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?

704
00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.292
And why would she do that?

705
00:45:52.375 --> 00:45:55.921
Maybe she had the hots for Steve
and killed them both in a jealous rage.

706
00:45:56.004 --> 00:45:58.131
What would Sidney want with Steve?

707
00:45:58.214 --> 00:46:00.842
She has her own
bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.

708
00:46:01.635 --> 00:46:04.304
Maybe she's a slut just like her mother.

709
00:46:04.387 --> 00:46:07.933
-You're evil.
-Please. It's a common fact.

710
00:46:08.016 --> 00:46:09.434
Her mother was a tramp.

711
00:46:09.517 --> 00:46:11.519
Cut some slack.
She watched her mom get butchered.

712
00:46:11.603 --> 00:46:13.980
Yeah, and it fucked her up royally.
Think about it.

713
00:46:14.064 --> 00:46:16.650
Her mother's death
leaves her disturbed and hostile

714
00:46:16.733 --> 00:46:19.069
in a cruel and inhumane world.

715
00:46:19.152 --> 00:46:23.281
She's delusional. "Where's God?"
Et cetera. Completely suicidal.

716
00:46:23.365 --> 00:46:26.326
One day, she snaps.
She wants to kill herself,

717
00:46:26.409 --> 00:46:29.579
but she realizes that teen suicide
is out this year,

718
00:46:29.663 --> 00:46:33.667
and homicide is a much healthier,
therapeutic expression.

719
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:35.585
Where do you get this shit?

720
00:46:35.669 --> 00:46:36.670
Ricki Lake.

721
00:46:37.504 --> 00:46:39.381
You are pathetic!

722
00:46:52.894 --> 00:46:54.020
"Pathetic."

723
00:46:55.855 --> 00:46:57.857
Sidney.

724
00:47:22.757 --> 00:47:24.509
Sidney.

725
00:47:30.015 --> 00:47:31.057
Is someone there?

726
00:48:11.389 --> 00:48:13.016
In what appears fo be a prank,

727
00:48:13.099 --> 00:48:15.560
several students were seen
wearing scary masks.

728
00:48:15.643 --> 00:48:17.395
School officials have yet to comment,

729
00:48:17.479 --> 00:48:21.608
but this is known to be the same costume
worn by the Killer.

730
00:48:21.691 --> 00:48:24.444
Seventeen-year-old Casey Becker
and her boyfriend Steven Orth

731
00:48:24.527 --> 00:48:27.530
have already lost their lives. Who's next?

732
00:48:27.614 --> 00:48:31.576
You can literally feel
the fear on this campus.

733
00:48:31.659 --> 00:48:34.996
Hi. Gale Weathers,
field correspondent, 7op Story.

734
00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:38.333
I know who you are, Miss Weathers.
How's the eye?

735
00:48:38.416 --> 00:48:41.044
It's productive.
Is there a problem on campus?

736
00:48:41.127 --> 00:48:43.254
No. Everything's under control.

737
00:48:43.338 --> 00:48:44.839
Well, of course. You're here.

738
00:48:45.465 --> 00:48:46.758
You're not supposed to be here.

739
00:48:46.841 --> 00:48:49.552
I know. I should be in New York
covering the Sharon Stone stalker,

740
00:48:49.636 --> 00:48:50.970
but who knew?

741
00:48:52.305 --> 00:48:54.432
You look awfully young
to be a police officer.

742
00:48:55.642 --> 00:48:57.102
I'm 25 years old.

743
00:48:57.185 --> 00:48:58.686
You know, in a demographic study,

744
00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:01.981
I proved to be most popular
amongst males 11 to 24.

745
00:49:02.816 --> 00:49:03.817
Guess I just missed you.

746
00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:07.112
Of course, you don't look a day over 12,

747
00:49:07.195 --> 00:49:09.989
except in that upper-torso area.

748
00:49:10.073 --> 00:49:12.450
-Does the force require you to work out?
-No, ma'am.

749
00:49:13.743 --> 00:49:15.245
â€˜Cause of my boyish good looks,

750
00:49:15.328 --> 00:49:18.790
muscle mass has increased my acceptance
as a serious police officer.

751
00:49:19.582 --> 00:49:21.501
I need your attention now, kids.

752
00:49:21.584 --> 00:49:23.628
Due fo the recent events
that have occurred,

753
00:49:23.711 --> 00:49:27.715
effective immediately, all classes
are suspended until further nofice.

754
00:49:29.008 --> 00:49:32.428
The Woodsboro Police Department
has issued a citywide curfew

755
00:49:32.512 --> 00:49:35.265
beginning at nine o'clock tonight.

756
00:49:36.266 --> 00:49:38.268
Looks like we've got
a serial killer on our hands.

757
00:49:38.351 --> 00:49:40.603
Well, a serial killer
is not really accurate.

758
00:49:40.687 --> 00:49:43.106
Gotta knock off a couple more
to get that title.

759
00:49:43.189 --> 00:49:44.607
Well, we can help, can't we?

760
00:49:46.317 --> 00:49:48.570
I mean, we certainly don't have any leads.

761
00:49:48.653 --> 00:49:50.613
Have you located Sidney's father yet?

762
00:49:51.489 --> 00:49:52.574
No, not yet.

763
00:49:52.657 --> 00:49:54.242
Well, he's not a suspect, is he?

764
00:49:54.325 --> 00:49:56.703
We haven't ruled him out as a possibility.

765
00:49:58.037 --> 00:50:00.790
-If you'll excuse me.
-I'm sorry. Am I keeping you?

766
00:50:01.624 --> 00:50:03.418
If I may say so, Miss Weathers...

767
00:50:05.795 --> 00:50:07.547
you are much prettier in person.

768
00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:11.217
So you do watch the show.

769
00:50:13.094 --> 00:50:16.931
I'm 25. I was 24 for a whole year.

770
00:50:18.558 --> 00:50:20.018
Please, call me Gale.

771
00:50:21.436 --> 00:50:23.771
It was just some sick fuck
having a laugh, Sidney.

772
00:50:23.855 --> 00:50:26.107
No, it was him, Tatum. I know it.

773
00:50:26.191 --> 00:50:30.278
You're not to be alone anymore, right?
If you pee, I pee. Is that clear?

774
00:50:30.361 --> 00:50:32.780
Kizool, 'cause schizzool is izzout.

775
00:50:32.864 --> 00:50:35.909
I don't know what you did, Sidney,
but on behalf of the entire student body,

776
00:50:35.992 --> 00:50:38.286
-we all say thank you!
-Stop it, Stu.

777
00:50:38.369 --> 00:50:42.373
No, I say impromptu party tonight,
my house,

778
00:50:42.457 --> 00:50:44.417
to celebrate this little siesta.
What do you say?

779
00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:45.627
Are you serious?

780
00:50:46.461 --> 00:50:47.712
Parents are out of town,

781
00:50:47.795 --> 00:50:50.924
and if this little vixen doesn't invite
the entire world, we'll be fine.

782
00:50:51.007 --> 00:50:53.259
Intimate gathering, intimate friends.

783
00:50:53.343 --> 00:50:56.971
What do you say, Sid?
I mean, pathos could have its perks.

784
00:50:57.055 --> 00:50:59.599
Totally protected. Yo, I am so buff.

785
00:50:59.682 --> 00:51:01.601
-I got you covered, girl.
-No...

786
00:51:02.477 --> 00:51:04.020
Come on, Sid.

787
00:51:04.103 --> 00:51:05.813
For me? It could be fun.

788
00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.816
Okay, whatever.

789
00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:10.526
Yeah? Nice.

790
00:51:11.152 --> 00:51:12.779
Cool. You guys bring food, all right?

791
00:51:31.047 --> 00:51:32.215
Yes?

792
00:51:33.258 --> 00:51:34.300
Hello?

793
00:51:50.608 --> 00:51:51.609
Damn it.

794
00:52:10.044 --> 00:52:12.130
-Damn little shits.
-What'd you call me?

795
00:52:13.673 --> 00:52:15.591
-Not you, Fred.
-Prick.

796
00:53:28.623 --> 00:53:31.042
What if Cotton Weary is telling the truth?

797
00:53:31.125 --> 00:53:34.629
Maybe he was having an affair
with your mom.

798
00:53:34.712 --> 00:53:37.215
I mean, your dad was always
out of town on business. Maybe...

799
00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:41.928
maybe your mom
was just a very unhappy woman.

800
00:53:42.011 --> 00:53:43.846
If they were having an affair,

801
00:53:43.930 --> 00:53:46.015
then how come
Cotton couldn't prove it in court?

802
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:50.895
Well, you can't prove a rumor.
That's why it's a rumor.

803
00:53:50.978 --> 00:53:55.024
Right, created by
that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.

804
00:53:56.567 --> 00:53:58.403
It goes further back, Sid.

805
00:54:00.238 --> 00:54:01.948
There's been talk about other men.

806
00:54:02.532 --> 00:54:03.658
And you believe it?

807
00:54:05.118 --> 00:54:06.119
Well...

808
00:54:07.286 --> 00:54:09.497
I mean, you can only hear
that Richard Gere gerbil story

809
00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:12.542
SO many times
before you have to start believing it.

810
00:54:18.256 --> 00:54:19.298
I'm sorry.

811
00:54:22.635 --> 00:54:24.762
You know, if I was wrong
about Cotton Weary,

812
00:54:24.846 --> 00:54:27.223
then the killer's still out there.

813
00:54:27.306 --> 00:54:28.391
Don't go there, Sid.

814
00:54:28.474 --> 00:54:31.436
You're starting to sound like
some Wes Carpenter flick or something.

815
00:54:31.519 --> 00:54:34.272
Don't freak yourself out, okay?
We've got a long night ahead of us.

816
00:54:35.189 --> 00:54:36.190
Okay?

817
00:54:37.817 --> 00:54:38.860
Let's boogie.

818
00:54:43.239 --> 00:54:44.991
It's alive!

819
00:54:45.867 --> 00:54:47.493
In the name of God!

820
00:54:52.832 --> 00:54:54.292
-Watch it, jerk.
-I'm sorry.

821
00:54:59.005 --> 00:55:00.006
Dork.

822
00:55:01.466 --> 00:55:03.759
Jesus, this place is packed tonight, man.

823
00:55:04.427 --> 00:55:06.220
We had a run in the mass murder section.

824
00:55:06.304 --> 00:55:07.722
Coming to my fiesta?

825
00:55:07.805 --> 00:55:10.600
-Yeah, I'm off early. Curfew, you know?
-Cool.

826
00:55:10.683 --> 00:55:13.269
What's that werewolf movie
with ET's mom in it?

827
00:55:13.352 --> 00:55:14.979
The Howling. Horror, straight ahead.

828
00:55:15.062 --> 00:55:16.397
Okay, thanks.

829
00:55:18.274 --> 00:55:20.234
Oh, now, that's in poor taste.

830
00:55:20.318 --> 00:55:21.611
What?

831
00:55:22.445 --> 00:55:25.031
If you were the only suspect
in a senseless bloodbath,

832
00:55:25.781 --> 00:55:27.783
would you being standing
in the horror section?

833
00:55:28.284 --> 00:55:30.786
Well, it was just a misunderstanding.

834
00:55:31.412 --> 00:55:32.580
He didn't do anything.

835
00:55:32.663 --> 00:55:34.540
You're such a little lap dog.

836
00:55:34.624 --> 00:55:36.751
He's got "killer"
printed all over his forehead.

837
00:55:36.834 --> 00:55:39.504
Okay, really?

838
00:55:39.587 --> 00:55:41.881
Why'd the cops let him go, smart guy?

839
00:55:41.964 --> 00:55:44.008
Because obviously
they don't watch enough movies.

840
00:55:44.091 --> 00:55:46.052
This is standard horror movie stuff.

841
00:55:46.135 --> 00:55:47.678
Prom Night revisited, man.

842
00:55:47.762 --> 00:55:50.765
Yeah? Why would he want to kill
his own girlfriend?

843
00:55:50.848 --> 00:55:53.893
There's always some stupid bullshit reason
to kill your girlfriend.

844
00:55:54.685 --> 00:55:57.104
That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity.

845
00:55:57.772 --> 00:56:01.275
Besides, if it gets too complicated,
you'll lose your target audience.

846
00:56:01.359 --> 00:56:03.402
Well, what's his reason?

847
00:56:04.153 --> 00:56:05.947
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.

848
00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:08.950
What, is she saving herself for you?

849
00:56:09.033 --> 00:56:11.035
Maybe. Now that Billy
tried to mutilate her...

850
00:56:11.994 --> 00:56:13.788
do you think Sid would go out with me?

851
00:56:19.794 --> 00:56:22.129
No, I don't, at all. No.

852
00:56:22.713 --> 00:56:23.714
Know who I think it is?

853
00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:27.343
You know, I think it's her father.

854
00:56:28.344 --> 00:56:30.555
Why can't they find her pops, man?

855
00:56:30.638 --> 00:56:32.932
Because he's probably dead.

856
00:56:33.849 --> 00:56:36.561
His body will come popping up
in the last reel somewhere,

857
00:56:36.644 --> 00:56:39.855
eyes gouged out, fingers cut off,
teeth knocked out!

858
00:56:40.648 --> 00:56:42.984
See, the police are always
off track with this shit.

859
00:56:43.067 --> 00:56:45.069
If they watched Prom Night,
they'd save time.

860
00:56:45.152 --> 00:56:48.364
There's a formula to it,
a very simple formula!

861
00:56:48.447 --> 00:56:49.907
Everybody's a suspect!

862
00:56:55.955 --> 00:56:58.040
I'm telling you, the dad's a red herring.
It's Billy.

863
00:57:00.209 --> 00:57:01.919
How do we know you're not the killer?

864
00:57:04.755 --> 00:57:05.756
Hi, Billy.

865
00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:08.092
Maybe your movie-freaked mind
lost its reality button.

866
00:57:08.175 --> 00:57:09.176
Ever think of that?

867
00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:11.470
You're absolutely right.
I'm the first to admit it.

868
00:57:11.554 --> 00:57:14.015
If this were a scary movie,
I'd be the prime suspect.

869
00:57:14.098 --> 00:57:15.099
That's right.

870
00:57:15.182 --> 00:57:16.976
And what would be your motive?

871
00:57:17.935 --> 00:57:19.103
It's the millennium.

872
00:57:20.271 --> 00:57:21.939
Motives are incidental.

873
00:57:22.023 --> 00:57:23.107
Millennium?

874
00:57:24.191 --> 00:57:25.568
Millennium, I like that.

875
00:57:25.651 --> 00:57:28.362
That's good. "It's the millennium."

876
00:57:29.572 --> 00:57:30.656
Good kid.

877
00:57:32.867 --> 00:57:35.077
"Millennium." Good word, my man.

878
00:57:35.745 --> 00:57:37.705
Now, you're telling me
that's not a killer?

879
00:58:22.667 --> 00:58:23.834
Sure is quiet.

880
00:58:25.836 --> 00:58:29.173
God, look at this place.
It's The Town That Dreaded Sundown.

881
00:58:29.256 --> 00:58:32.301
Yeah, I saw that movie.
It's about a killer in Texas, huh?

882
00:58:33.386 --> 00:58:35.471
Hey, Sid, just think,
if they make a movie about you,

883
00:58:35.554 --> 00:58:36.847
who's gonna play you?

884
00:58:36.931 --> 00:58:38.683
I shudder to think.

885
00:58:38.766 --> 00:58:41.018
I see you as a young Meg Ryan, myself.

886
00:58:41.102 --> 00:58:43.521
Thanks, Dewey. With my luck,
they'd cast Tori Spelling.

887
00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:46.399
I'm just gonna be a few minutes.

888
00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:49.151
You girls don't go too far.

889
00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:53.531
Is Billy gonna be there tonight?

890
00:58:53.614 --> 00:58:56.575
He better not be.
I told Stu to keep his mouth shut.

891
00:58:56.659 --> 00:58:59.245
I think we can live without
the endorphin rush for one night.

892
00:59:01.872 --> 00:59:05.000
Billy's right, you know. Whenever
he touches me, I just can't relax.

893
00:59:05.084 --> 00:59:08.879
So you have a few intimacy issues as
a result of your mother's untimely death.

894
00:59:08.963 --> 00:59:11.257
It's no big deal, Sid. You'll thaw out.

895
00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:14.802
Yeah, but he has been so patient with me,
you know, with all this sex stuff.

896
00:59:14.885 --> 00:59:17.555
How many guys will put up
with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?

897
00:59:18.806 --> 00:59:20.975
Billy and his penis
don't deserve you, all right?

898
00:59:30.818 --> 00:59:32.153
Dewey, where the hell you been?

899
00:59:32.236 --> 00:59:34.029
I was keeping an eye on Sidney.

900
00:59:36.449 --> 00:59:37.575
Thought you quit.

901
00:59:38.242 --> 00:59:40.035
I did, but damn it...

902
00:59:41.662 --> 00:59:44.373
Dewey, Vital Phone just faxed us.

903
00:59:45.166 --> 00:59:48.919
Those calls are listed to Neil Prescott,
Sidney's father.

904
00:59:49.503 --> 00:59:52.298
He made the calls with a cellular phone.
It's been confirmed.

905
00:59:53.883 --> 00:59:56.135
Well, there's no way his cellular
could've been cloned?

906
00:59:56.761 --> 00:59:59.221
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is?

907
00:59:59.847 --> 01:00:02.183
The anniversary of his wife's death.

908
01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:07.980
We'll keep the roadblocks and the curfew
in effect through the night.

909
01:00:08.063 --> 01:00:10.775
If he's not picked up by morning,
then we'll do a house-to-house.

910
01:00:12.735 --> 01:00:13.736
Where's Sidney?

911
01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.363
She's with my sister.
You want me to bring her in?

912
01:00:18.157 --> 01:00:23.037
Not just yet. Let's find Neil first,
make sure he's our man.

913
01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:33.506
You stay close to Sidney.

914
01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:35.674
Don't let her out of your sight.

915
01:00:35.758 --> 01:00:36.842
Yes, sir.

916
01:01:13.087 --> 01:01:14.672
All right. You girls have fun.

917
01:01:15.548 --> 01:01:17.466
Not too much fun, or I'll bust ya.

918
01:01:19.718 --> 01:01:21.178
-Bye.
-Bye, Sid.

919
01:01:34.692 --> 01:01:35.860
We are here.

920
01:01:35.943 --> 01:01:37.403
Yeah!

921
01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:40.781
Oh, that's superb.

922
01:01:40.865 --> 01:01:43.325
You guys are tardy for the party
so we started without you.

923
01:01:43.409 --> 01:01:45.160
My man! Yeah!

924
01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:05.973
Well, were we spotted?

925
01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:08.559
I don't think so. Now get the camera.

926
01:02:08.642 --> 01:02:09.852
Ma'am...

927
01:02:11.103 --> 01:02:12.396
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

928
01:02:13.188 --> 01:02:14.440
Deputy, that's okay.

929
01:02:15.232 --> 01:02:16.692
What brings you to these parts?

930
01:02:17.276 --> 01:02:20.905
Well, you just never know
when or where a story will break.

931
01:02:21.697 --> 01:02:25.034
Not much of a story here.
Just a bunch of kids cutting it loose.

932
01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.828
Then what are you doing here?

933
01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:31.957
Just keeping an eye on things.

934
01:02:32.875 --> 01:02:34.168
I'm gonna check the party out.

935
01:02:36.045 --> 01:02:37.296
Do you mind if I join you?

936
01:02:38.339 --> 01:02:39.381
Not at all.

937
01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:41.884
Let me just get my coat.

938
01:02:49.016 --> 01:02:50.017
All right.

939
01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.435
Yeah, I'm fine.

940
01:02:52.686 --> 01:02:53.854
Oh, yeah.

941
01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:57.483
How many Evil Dead?

942
01:02:58.108 --> 01:03:00.235
-Yeah!
-How many Hellraiser?

943
01:03:00.319 --> 01:03:01.862
Hellraiser right here.

944
01:03:01.946 --> 01:03:04.949
The Fog, Terror Train, Prom Night.

945
01:03:05.032 --> 01:03:07.743
How come Jamie Lee Curtis
is in all of these movies?

946
01:03:08.369 --> 01:03:10.996
She's the... scream queen.

947
01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.207
I mean, with a set of lungs like that,
she should be.

948
01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:14.291
Yeah.

949
01:03:14.375 --> 01:03:15.918
Tits. See?

950
01:03:16.752 --> 01:03:17.753
I'll get it.

951
01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.257
Hey, Tate, grab me another beer,
would you?

952
01:03:22.341 --> 01:03:24.009
There's beer in the garage.

953
01:03:24.093 --> 01:03:25.719
What am I, the beer wench?

954
01:03:25.803 --> 01:03:27.096
She was nominated.

955
01:03:27.805 --> 01:03:30.766
-She was nominated for Terror Train.
-You are not gonna believe who's here.

956
01:03:30.849 --> 01:03:32.101
It's that chick from 7op Story.

957
01:03:32.184 --> 01:03:33.268
-Gale Weathers?
-Here.

958
01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:37.940
You're underage, son.

959
01:03:38.691 --> 01:03:41.193
I'm kidding. Have a good time.
Watch the driving.

960
01:03:41.819 --> 01:03:43.112
-Dewey?
-Hi.

961
01:03:43.821 --> 01:03:44.822
Dewey?

962
01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:47.992
What is she doing here?

963
01:03:48.075 --> 01:03:49.410
She's with me.

964
01:03:49.493 --> 01:03:51.120
I'm just checking things out.

965
01:03:51.203 --> 01:03:55.499
So you did. Now leave.
And take your media muff with you.

966
01:03:57.835 --> 01:04:00.421
-I just think you're awesome.
-Thank you very much.

967
01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:02.589
-I watch your show religiously.
-That's great.

968
01:04:02.673 --> 01:04:04.258
-Hey.
-Hey.

969
01:04:05.092 --> 01:04:06.260
I'm getting a camera.

970
01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:11.056
-Have you found my father?
-I'm afraid not.

971
01:04:12.850 --> 01:04:14.309
Should I be worried?

972
01:04:14.393 --> 01:04:15.394
Not yet.

973
01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:07.071
Jesus!

974
01:05:10.324 --> 01:05:12.034
Tatum, it's okay.

975
01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:23.128
Shit.

976
01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:29.676
Hey, shitheads!

977
01:05:31.887 --> 01:05:32.971
Hello?

978
01:05:35.307 --> 01:05:36.850
Shit. Piss.

979
01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:56.912
Is that you, Randy?

980
01:05:59.498 --> 01:06:02.918
Cute. And what movie is this from?
I Spit On Your Garage?

981
01:06:04.336 --> 01:06:06.547
Lose the outfit.
If Sidney sees it, she'll flip.

982
01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:09.591
You wanna play psycho killer?

983
01:06:10.801 --> 01:06:12.511
Can I be the helpless victim?

984
01:06:13.554 --> 01:06:17.391
Okay, let's see.
No, please don't kill me, Mr. Ghostface.

985
01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:18.934
I want to be in the sequel.

986
01:06:21.603 --> 01:06:23.897
Cut, Casper. That's a wrap.

987
01:06:26.608 --> 01:06:28.235
Randy, what the hell are you doing?

988
01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:30.571
Don't-- What?

989
01:06:32.865 --> 01:06:33.866
Stop!

990
01:06:49.298 --> 01:06:50.799
Fucker!

991
01:07:26.627 --> 01:07:28.420
No! No!

992
01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.396
Happy curfew.

993
01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:47.731
Nice party, Stu.

994
01:07:48.273 --> 01:07:49.441
Tatum, come on!

995
01:07:49.524 --> 01:07:51.235
Nobody here but us chickens!

996
01:07:51.318 --> 01:07:53.362
-Do you know where she is?
-No, I haven't seen her.

997
01:07:57.407 --> 01:07:58.700
Billy, hey.

998
01:07:58.784 --> 01:08:01.286
Billy. What are you doing here?

999
01:08:01.954 --> 01:08:03.580
I was hoping I could talk to Sid alone.

1000
01:08:04.289 --> 01:08:06.792
You know, if Tatum sees you here,
she'll draw blood.

1001
01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:09.253
Tell you what, why don't you guys
go up to my parents' room?

1002
01:08:09.336 --> 01:08:11.004
You know, you guys can talk...

1003
01:08:11.964 --> 01:08:13.340
whatever.

1004
01:08:14.132 --> 01:08:15.801
"Subtlety," Stu, you should look it up.

1005
01:08:17.886 --> 01:08:19.930
No, it's okay. We do need to talk.

1006
01:08:30.023 --> 01:08:31.692
What's Leatherface doing here?

1007
01:08:31.775 --> 01:08:33.402
He came to make up.

1008
01:08:34.069 --> 01:08:36.405
There goes my chance with Sid. Damn it.

1009
01:08:37.197 --> 01:08:40.242
As if. That's all I'm saying. As if.

1010
01:08:41.285 --> 01:08:42.661
Oh, really, Alicia?

1011
01:08:44.288 --> 01:08:45.580
As if.

1012
01:08:45.664 --> 01:08:47.124
I'm gonna go check on them.

1013
01:08:47.207 --> 01:08:48.333
Come on!

1014
01:08:48.917 --> 01:08:50.794
Okay, everyone.
It was nice to meet all of you.

1015
01:08:50.877 --> 01:08:51.878
Thank you.

1016
01:08:53.505 --> 01:08:54.715
You're a genius.

1017
01:08:56.174 --> 01:08:58.093
-Oh, shit.
-What?

1018
01:08:58.719 --> 01:09:01.013
-I got a delay.
-How long is it?

1019
01:09:01.096 --> 01:09:04.141
I don't know. What'd it take you
to walk from the house, 30 seconds?

1020
01:09:04.224 --> 01:09:05.726
It'll be fine. Just record it.

1021
01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:07.644
-All right.
-The placement is perfect.

1022
01:09:08.312 --> 01:09:09.896
Tell me, Kenneth,

1023
01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:12.983
has a cheesy tabloid journalist
ever won the Pulitzer?

1024
01:09:13.692 --> 01:09:15.027
First time for everything.

1025
01:09:15.694 --> 01:09:16.820
You're damn right.

1026
01:09:24.244 --> 01:09:25.287
So...

1027
01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:29.541
So...

1028
01:09:33.045 --> 01:09:34.129
Look, I'm sorry.

1029
01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:37.799
I've been selfish...

1030
01:09:38.884 --> 01:09:40.177
and I want to apologize.

1031
01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:42.596
No. Billy, I'm...

1032
01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:47.059
the one who's been selfish
and self-absorbed

1033
01:09:47.142 --> 01:09:49.478
with all this post-traumatic stress.

1034
01:09:50.854 --> 01:09:51.855
You lost your mom.

1035
01:09:51.938 --> 01:09:53.774
Yeah, I know, but you're right.

1036
01:09:54.524 --> 01:10:00.614
Enough is enough. I can't wallow
in the grief process forever, and...

1037
01:10:04.076 --> 01:10:08.455
And I can't keep lying to myself
about who my mom was.

1038
01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:15.379
Yeah, I think I'm really...

1039
01:10:18.006 --> 01:10:19.049
scared...

1040
01:10:20.384 --> 01:10:22.844
that I'm gonna turn out just like her,
you know?

1041
01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:27.057
Like the bad seed or something.

1042
01:10:28.433 --> 01:10:30.769
And I know it doesn't make sense.

1043
01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:33.688
Yeah, it does.

1044
01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:42.030
It's like Jodie Foster
in Silence of the Lambs

1045
01:10:42.114 --> 01:10:45.867
when she keeps having flashbacks
of her dead father.

1046
01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:47.327
But this is life.

1047
01:10:48.412 --> 01:10:49.538
This isn't a movie.

1048
01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:51.373
Sure it is, Sid.

1049
01:10:52.707 --> 01:10:55.419
It's all... it's all a movie. It's all...

1050
01:10:56.628 --> 01:10:58.255
one great big movie.

1051
01:11:05.137 --> 01:11:07.431
Only you can't pick your genre.

1052
01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.334
Why can't I be a Meg Ryan movie?

1053
01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:41.965
Or even a good porno?

1054
01:11:46.386 --> 01:11:48.513
-What?
-You heard me.

1055
01:11:57.814 --> 01:11:59.024
Are you sure?

1056
01:12:01.193 --> 01:12:02.194
Yeah.

1057
01:12:03.445 --> 01:12:04.613
I think so.

1058
01:12:21.755 --> 01:12:23.256
Look, look. Here it comes.

1059
01:12:25.342 --> 01:12:27.677
Oh, man,
the color of the blood is all wrong.

1060
01:12:27.761 --> 01:12:30.305
Now why do they do that? It's too red!

1061
01:12:30.388 --> 01:12:32.015
Wait, here comes another one.

1062
01:12:32.098 --> 01:12:33.850
Here, here...

1063
01:12:34.434 --> 01:12:36.019
Yes! Yes!

1064
01:12:36.102 --> 01:12:38.313
Predictable. I knew he was gonna bite it.

1065
01:12:38.396 --> 01:12:40.148
How can you watch this shit over and over?

1066
01:12:40.899 --> 01:12:43.443
When do we see breasts?
I want to see Jamie Lee's breasts.

1067
01:12:43.527 --> 01:12:45.487
-When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
-Yes. Yes!

1068
01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:48.740
Breasts? Not until 7rading Places in '83.

1069
01:12:48.823 --> 01:12:51.159
Jamie Lee was always the virgin
in horror movies.

1070
01:12:51.243 --> 01:12:53.703
She never showed her tits
till she went legits.

1071
01:12:53.787 --> 01:12:55.455
Could afford a decent pair.

1072
01:12:55.539 --> 01:12:56.831
What'd you say?

1073
01:12:56.915 --> 01:13:00.001
That's why she always outsmarted
the killer in the chase scene at the end.

1074
01:13:00.085 --> 01:13:02.379
Only virgins can do that.
Don't you know the rules?

1075
01:13:02.462 --> 01:13:03.755
What rules?

1076
01:13:03.838 --> 01:13:04.839
You don't--

1077
01:13:07.384 --> 01:13:09.636
Jesus Christ! You don't know the rules?

1078
01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:11.763
Have an aneurysm, why don't you?

1079
01:13:11.846 --> 01:13:14.558
There are certain rules
that one must abide by

1080
01:13:14.641 --> 01:13:17.143
in order to successfully survive
a horror movie.

1081
01:13:17.227 --> 01:13:20.814
For instance, number one,
you can never have sex.

1082
01:13:21.690 --> 01:13:22.857
No! No!

1083
01:13:23.525 --> 01:13:25.193
Big no-no! Big no-no!

1084
01:13:25.277 --> 01:13:27.070
I'd be a dead man.

1085
01:13:27.153 --> 01:13:29.072
Sex equals death, okay?

1086
01:13:29.155 --> 01:13:32.242
Number two,
you can never drink or do drugs.

1087
01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:37.122
No, the sin factor.

1088
01:13:37.205 --> 01:13:39.499
This is sin.
It's an extension of number one.

1089
01:13:39.583 --> 01:13:43.837
And number three, never, ever, ever,
under any circumstances, say,

1090
01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.839
"I'll be right back,"
â€˜cause you won't be back.

1091
01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:47.757
I'm getting another beer. You want one?

1092
01:13:47.841 --> 01:13:50.176
-Yeah, sure.
-I'll be right back!

1093
01:13:52.971 --> 01:13:55.682
You see, you push the laws,
and you end up dead, okay?

1094
01:13:55.765 --> 01:13:57.392
I'll see you in the kitchen with a knife.

1095
01:13:57.475 --> 01:14:00.770
Only virgins can outsmart the killer
in the big chase scene at the end.

1096
01:14:00.854 --> 01:14:02.230
Don't you know the rules?

1097
01:14:02.314 --> 01:14:04.983
-What rules?
-You don't know the rules?

1098
01:14:05.066 --> 01:14:08.486
There are certain rules that one must
abide by in order to successfully survive...

1099
01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:09.571
Boring.

1100
01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:14.993
The sheriff just radioed.

1101
01:14:15.076 --> 01:14:17.203
Somebody reported a car in the bushes
down the road.

1102
01:14:17.287 --> 01:14:19.789
I'm gonna go check it out.
You care to join me?

1103
01:14:20.582 --> 01:14:21.708
I'd love to.

1104
01:14:22.292 --> 01:14:23.877
If you're sure it's all right.

1105
01:14:24.878 --> 01:14:27.464
Ma'am, I'm the deputy of this town.

1106
01:14:29.966 --> 01:14:31.217
Be right back.

1107
01:14:34.596 --> 01:14:37.682
You see, you push the laws
and you end up dead, okay?

1108
01:14:37.766 --> 01:14:38.808
Excuse me, ma'am.

1109
01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:41.811
I thought maybe we'd walk.

1110
01:14:43.647 --> 01:14:45.273
It's such a nice night out.

1111
01:14:46.107 --> 01:14:47.692
I got a flashlight.

1112
01:14:50.111 --> 01:14:51.655
You're not scared, are you?

1113
01:14:51.738 --> 01:14:52.739
No.

1114
01:14:53.698 --> 01:14:55.700
-All right.
-Great.

1115
01:15:00.246 --> 01:15:02.290
Do you know what that constellation is?

1116
01:15:02.374 --> 01:15:03.416
No. What is it?

1117
01:15:04.542 --> 01:15:06.628
I don't know. That's why I was asking you.

1118
01:15:09.589 --> 01:15:11.383
Take it easy, guys. You guys drive safe.

1119
01:15:11.466 --> 01:15:14.344
-So what happened to Tatum, Stu?
-Probably got pissed at me and bailed.

1120
01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:15.512
-Bye.
-Bye.

1121
01:15:18.223 --> 01:15:19.933
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding you.

1122
01:15:28.316 --> 01:15:29.317
Hey.

1123
01:15:36.491 --> 01:15:39.244
Look! Here comes the obligatory tit shot.

1124
01:15:43.164 --> 01:15:44.749
-Yes!
-Lovely!

1125
01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:48.378
Oh, my God.

1126
01:15:48.461 --> 01:15:49.879
I'll leave you guys alone.

1127
01:15:51.172 --> 01:15:52.590
You are so...

1128
01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:55.552
amazing.

1129
01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:03.101
Hello?

1130
01:16:03.643 --> 01:16:04.644
Yeah.

1131
01:16:09.524 --> 01:16:11.192
Holy shit.

1132
01:16:13.194 --> 01:16:14.195
No...

1133
01:16:15.655 --> 01:16:16.990
Listen up.

1134
01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:18.908
They found Principal Himbry dead.

1135
01:16:19.993 --> 01:16:22.954
He was gutted and hung
from the goalpost on the football field.

1136
01:16:23.037 --> 01:16:24.330
What are we waiting for?

1137
01:16:24.414 --> 01:16:26.583
Let's go over there
before they pry him down.

1138
01:16:27.417 --> 01:16:28.418
Hey.

1139
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:30.670
Hey.

1140
01:16:30.754 --> 01:16:32.172
Hey, where'd he say he was?

1141
01:16:32.255 --> 01:16:34.048
The football field! Come on!

1142
01:16:34.758 --> 01:16:35.925
Where you guys going?

1143
01:16:38.261 --> 01:16:40.013
We were just getting to the good part.

1144
01:16:41.055 --> 01:16:42.265
Hello?

1145
01:16:42.348 --> 01:16:43.349
Yeah.

1146
01:17:07.999 --> 01:17:09.334
Come on! Let's go!

1147
01:17:10.251 --> 01:17:12.128
So, is Dewey your real name?

1148
01:17:13.004 --> 01:17:14.547
No, it's Dwight.

1149
01:17:14.631 --> 01:17:15.632
Dwight?

1150
01:17:16.257 --> 01:17:18.468
-I'm sorry.
-It's all right.

1151
01:17:19.093 --> 01:17:21.679
Dewey's just something I got stuck with
a long time ago.

1152
01:17:22.764 --> 01:17:23.932
Well, I like it.

1153
01:17:25.725 --> 01:17:26.726
Sexy.

1154
01:17:27.268 --> 01:17:28.353
Sexy?

1155
01:17:30.188 --> 01:17:32.899
It's just this town's way
of not taking me serious.

1156
01:17:33.566 --> 01:17:35.068
What about Gale Weathers?

1157
01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:38.863
Sounds like I'm a meteorologist
or something.

1158
01:17:40.532 --> 01:17:44.410
People treat me like I'm the Antichrist
of television journalism.

1159
01:17:45.662 --> 01:17:47.038
I don't think you're that bad.

1160
01:17:47.121 --> 01:17:48.206
-No?
-No.

1161
01:17:48.289 --> 01:17:50.250
I think that's just â€˜cause
you kind of like me.

1162
01:17:50.917 --> 01:17:53.962
They sure are coming fast.
Slow down. Freeze!

1163
01:17:59.551 --> 01:18:00.552
I'm sorry.

1164
01:18:01.094 --> 01:18:02.554
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1165
01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:16.401
I'm sorry.

1166
01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:18.069
I'm on duty.

1167
01:18:26.995 --> 01:18:28.413
Is that what you're looking for?

1168
01:18:29.497 --> 01:18:30.540
My whole life.

1169
01:18:36.588 --> 01:18:37.964
-Damn.
-What?

1170
01:18:38.965 --> 01:18:40.925
-What is it?
-This is Neil Prescott's car.

1171
01:18:41.009 --> 01:18:42.635
-Sidney's father?
-Yeah.

1172
01:18:44.846 --> 01:18:46.431
Jesus. What's he doing here?

1173
01:18:48.349 --> 01:18:49.434
We got to get back.

1174
01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:54.981
Are you okay?

1175
01:18:57.483 --> 01:18:58.484
Yeah.

1176
01:18:59.527 --> 01:19:00.612
Yeah, I'm fine.

1177
01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:13.166
Who'd you call?

1178
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.043
What?

1179
01:19:15.919 --> 01:19:17.795
Well, I don't know. When you're arrested,

1180
01:19:17.879 --> 01:19:21.257
you're allowed one phone call,
so I was just curious. Who'd you call?

1181
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:25.678
I called my dad.

1182
01:19:28.473 --> 01:19:31.726
No. Sheriff Burke called your dad.
I saw him.

1183
01:19:34.729 --> 01:19:38.066
Yeah. But when I called,
I didn't get an answer.

1184
01:19:49.786 --> 01:19:51.788
You don't still think it was me, do you?

1185
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.001
No.

1186
01:19:58.753 --> 01:19:59.754
No.

1187
01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:01.839
I was just thinking if it were you,

1188
01:20:01.923 --> 01:20:04.968
it'd be a very clever way
to throw me off track.

1189
01:20:05.051 --> 01:20:06.886
You know, using your one phone call
to call me

1190
01:20:06.970 --> 01:20:09.222
so that I wouldn't think it was you.
That's all.

1191
01:20:10.974 --> 01:20:12.016
Really?

1192
01:20:20.024 --> 01:20:24.404
What do I have to do to prove to you
that I'm not a killer?

1193
01:20:26.239 --> 01:20:27.281
Oh, my God.

1194
01:20:30.201 --> 01:20:31.661
-Oh, my God!
-Sidney.

1195
01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:32.745
Billy, watch out!

1196
01:20:43.256 --> 01:20:44.257
Sid.

1197
01:21:21.878 --> 01:21:22.879
Shit.

1198
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:31.804
Help me, somebody! Help me!

1199
01:21:50.281 --> 01:21:51.282
Help me!

1200
01:22:22.647 --> 01:22:23.940
No, Jamie.

1201
01:22:25.858 --> 01:22:27.068
Watch out.

1202
01:22:27.610 --> 01:22:29.779
Watch out, Jamie. You know he's around.

1203
01:22:29.862 --> 01:22:31.072
You-- You know--

1204
01:22:33.366 --> 01:22:36.828
There he is. I told you.
I told you. He's right around the corner.

1205
01:22:38.204 --> 01:22:40.248
Jamie... Jamie.

1206
01:22:41.666 --> 01:22:46.045
Jamie, look behind you.
Look behind you. Turn around.

1207
01:22:47.255 --> 01:22:49.423
Behind you. Turn--

1208
01:22:50.258 --> 01:22:51.676
Behind you.

1209
01:22:52.510 --> 01:22:54.053
Behind you, Jamie.

1210
01:22:54.887 --> 01:22:59.058
Jamie, turn around.
All right! You turned around.

1211
01:22:59.142 --> 01:23:00.768
Help me! Help!

1212
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:15.116
Let me in!

1213
01:23:17.410 --> 01:23:19.370
-The killer's after me. He's in the house.
-Where?

1214
01:23:19.453 --> 01:23:21.622
Wait a minute.
There's a camera in the house. Look.

1215
01:23:21.706 --> 01:23:24.208
Behind you!

1216
01:23:25.084 --> 01:23:26.169
-Oh, shit.
-No.

1217
01:23:27.003 --> 01:23:28.421
Jamie, Jamie...

1218
01:23:28.504 --> 01:23:29.505
-Behind you, kid!
-Randy!

1219
01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:33.134
-Behind you!
-Look around.

1220
01:23:35.887 --> 01:23:37.138
Shit.

1221
01:23:37.221 --> 01:23:38.931
-What?
-We're on a 30-second delay.

1222
01:23:39.807 --> 01:23:40.808
Oh, my God.

1223
01:24:34.237 --> 01:24:35.905
-Is there a phone in the van?
-Yeah.

1224
01:24:37.698 --> 01:24:40.159
Lock yourself in it.
Call the sheriff for backup.

1225
01:24:42.662 --> 01:24:43.663
Be careful.

1226
01:24:57.677 --> 01:24:58.678
Neil?

1227
01:25:05.142 --> 01:25:06.310
Mr. Prescott?

1228
01:25:27.164 --> 01:25:28.708
Kenny, I need the cellular!

1229
01:25:33.170 --> 01:25:34.213
Kenny!

1230
01:25:36.048 --> 01:25:37.049
Kenny!

1231
01:26:02.742 --> 01:26:04.243
-911.
-What's going on?

1232
01:26:18.924 --> 01:26:19.925
Oh, God.

1233
01:26:36.609 --> 01:26:39.904
Oh, God, Kenny, I'm sorry,
but get off my fucking windshield!

1234
01:26:45.034 --> 01:26:46.369
Stop!

1235
01:26:55.294 --> 01:26:56.420
No!

1236
01:27:06.722 --> 01:27:07.723
Dewey!

1237
01:27:09.266 --> 01:27:10.434
Dewey, where are you?

1238
01:27:13.312 --> 01:27:14.313
Dewey!

1239
01:27:16.357 --> 01:27:17.400
Sidney?

1240
01:27:23.072 --> 01:27:24.073
Dewey!

1241
01:27:52.643 --> 01:27:53.644
Shit.

1242
01:28:24.383 --> 01:28:27.344
Hello? Help me, please.
I'm at Stu Macher's house on Turner Lane.

1243
01:28:27.428 --> 01:28:31.223
It's 261 Turner Lane. Please!
He's gonna try and kill me!

1244
01:28:31.765 --> 01:28:33.225
Oh, God!

1245
01:28:54.205 --> 01:28:55.831
Sidney!

1246
01:28:56.957 --> 01:28:59.919
Sidney, Jesus,
we got to get the fuck out of here!

1247
01:29:00.002 --> 01:29:01.837
-Stop right there!
-Don't shoot! It's me!

1248
01:29:01.921 --> 01:29:04.381
I found Tatum.
She's dead! I think Stu did it.

1249
01:29:04.465 --> 01:29:06.425
-Don't listen to him, Sidney!
-Stay back.

1250
01:29:06.509 --> 01:29:08.344
-Stu did it!
-He killed Billy.

1251
01:29:08.427 --> 01:29:10.721
-He killed my Tatum. He killed Billy.
-Stu did it.

1252
01:29:10.804 --> 01:29:12.348
-No, I didn't!
-He's lying!

1253
01:29:12.431 --> 01:29:16.101
Sidney, baby, please give me that gun.
Give me that gun! He killed Billy.

1254
01:29:16.185 --> 01:29:19.230
No, I didn't, Sid. He did it!

1255
01:29:19.313 --> 01:29:20.898
He did it, Sidney!

1256
01:29:20.981 --> 01:29:22.858
Please, I didn't do it. He did it. Please!

1257
01:29:22.942 --> 01:29:25.444
-Please, Sidney!
-Fuck you both!

1258
01:29:25.528 --> 01:29:26.570
-Please.
-No! No!

1259
01:29:26.654 --> 01:29:27.696
Sidney!

1260
01:29:28.948 --> 01:29:31.200
-Open up, Sid!
-We won't make it!

1261
01:29:32.868 --> 01:29:34.745
Help me, he's gone crazy!

1262
01:29:35.663 --> 01:29:37.289
-Sidney!
-Go away!

1263
01:29:37.998 --> 01:29:38.999
Sidney?

1264
01:29:40.125 --> 01:29:41.502
Leave me alone.

1265
01:29:47.758 --> 01:29:49.093
-Sid.
Billy.

1266
01:29:56.725 --> 01:29:59.103
-Billy! Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

1267
01:29:59.186 --> 01:30:01.355
Oh, God. I thought you were dead.

1268
01:30:01.438 --> 01:30:03.816
No. I mean, I got stuck pretty bad...

1269
01:30:04.441 --> 01:30:05.442
Get up.

1270
01:30:06.610 --> 01:30:08.571
-You okay?
-You're bleeding.

1271
01:30:09.989 --> 01:30:11.240
-Oh, my God.
-Gotta get help.

1272
01:30:11.323 --> 01:30:12.408
No! He's out there!

1273
01:30:12.491 --> 01:30:16.495
No. Give me the gun. Give me the gun.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1274
01:30:17.538 --> 01:30:18.539
Careful.

1275
01:30:20.583 --> 01:30:22.459
-Please help me!
-Get in. Get in.

1276
01:30:23.127 --> 01:30:25.421
Stu's flipped out! He's gone mad!

1277
01:30:27.923 --> 01:30:30.009
We all go a little mad sometimes.

1278
01:30:30.092 --> 01:30:31.677
-No, Billy!
-Oh, fuck!

1279
01:30:38.934 --> 01:30:40.853
Anthony Perkins, Psycho.

1280
01:30:48.235 --> 01:30:49.612
Corn syrup.

1281
01:30:49.695 --> 01:30:52.031
Same stuff they used
for pig's blood in Carrie.

1282
01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:54.742
No. No.

1283
01:30:56.201 --> 01:30:58.579
Stu, help me, please.

1284
01:31:01.498 --> 01:31:03.417
Surprise, Sidney.

1285
01:31:07.713 --> 01:31:09.340
No!

1286
01:31:10.424 --> 01:31:11.425
Oh, now.

1287
01:31:15.512 --> 01:31:18.307
What's the matter, Sidney?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

1288
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:20.893
Why are you doing this?

1289
01:31:20.976 --> 01:31:23.145
It's all part of the game, Sidney.

1290
01:31:23.228 --> 01:31:25.981
-It's called Guess How I'm Gonna Die!
-Fuck you!

1291
01:31:26.065 --> 01:31:29.860
No, no, no, no. We already played
that game, remember?

1292
01:31:30.736 --> 01:31:32.237
You lost.

1293
01:31:32.321 --> 01:31:33.781
See, fun and games, Sidney.

1294
01:31:33.864 --> 01:31:36.659
See, we ask you a question.
If you get it wrong...

1295
01:31:38.077 --> 01:31:39.078
you die.

1296
01:31:39.161 --> 01:31:41.372
If you get it right, you die.

1297
01:31:42.289 --> 01:31:43.916
You're crazy, both of you.

1298
01:31:43.999 --> 01:31:46.126
Actually we prefer the term psychotic.

1299
01:31:46.210 --> 01:31:47.586
You'll never get away with this.

1300
01:31:48.671 --> 01:31:49.672
Oh, no?

1301
01:31:50.881 --> 01:31:52.508
Tell that to Cotton Weary.

1302
01:31:53.258 --> 01:31:55.969
You wouldn't believe
how easy he was to frame.

1303
01:31:56.637 --> 01:31:59.098
Watch a few movies, take a few notes.

1304
01:32:00.099 --> 01:32:01.350
It was fun.

1305
01:32:01.975 --> 01:32:03.977
" -No!
here you going?

1306
01:32:05.938 --> 01:32:06.939
Why?

1307
01:32:08.732 --> 01:32:10.109
Why did you kill my mother?

1308
01:32:10.192 --> 01:32:11.485
Why?

1309
01:32:11.568 --> 01:32:12.653
Why?

1310
01:32:14.697 --> 01:32:16.657
You hear that, Stu?
I think she wants a motive.

1311
01:32:18.867 --> 01:32:20.160
I don't believe in motives, Sid.

1312
01:32:20.244 --> 01:32:22.663
-I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
-No.

1313
01:32:22.746 --> 01:32:25.290
Did they ever really decide why
Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people?

1314
01:32:25.374 --> 01:32:26.917
Don't think so.

1315
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.628
See, it's a lot scarier
when there's no motive, Sid.

1316
01:32:30.963 --> 01:32:32.381
We did your mom a favor, Sid.

1317
01:32:32.464 --> 01:32:35.092
That woman was a slutbag whore
who flashed her shit all over town

1318
01:32:35.175 --> 01:32:37.052
like she was Sharon Stone or something.

1319
01:32:37.136 --> 01:32:39.596
Yeah, we put her out of her misery,
â€˜cause let's face it, Sidney,

1320
01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:41.932
your mother was no Sharon Stone.

1321
01:32:48.063 --> 01:32:49.606
Is that motive enough for you?

1322
01:32:52.735 --> 01:32:54.027
How about this?

1323
01:32:55.696 --> 01:32:59.324
Your slut mother was fucking my father...

1324
01:33:01.326 --> 01:33:04.329
and she's the reason
my mom moved out and abandoned me.

1325
01:33:07.207 --> 01:33:08.667
How's that for a motive?

1326
01:33:10.419 --> 01:33:12.796
Maternal abandonment
causes serious deviant behavior.

1327
01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:15.507
Certainly fucked you up.
It made you have sex with a psychopath.

1328
01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:18.302
That's right. You gave it up.

1329
01:33:18.385 --> 01:33:20.053
Now you're no longer a virgin.

1330
01:33:20.721 --> 01:33:21.889
I said "virgin."

1331
01:33:22.806 --> 01:33:25.768
Now you gotta die. Those are the rules.

1332
01:33:25.851 --> 01:33:27.936
Just pretend it's all a scary movie, Sid.

1333
01:33:28.645 --> 01:33:29.980
How do you think it's gonna end?

1334
01:33:34.318 --> 01:33:36.904
This is the greatest part!
You're gonna love this.

1335
01:33:36.987 --> 01:33:38.781
We got a surprise for you, Sidney.

1336
01:33:39.364 --> 01:33:42.367
Yeah, you're gonna love this one.
It's a scream, baby!

1337
01:33:42.451 --> 01:33:44.620
Hold on a sec. I'll be right back.

1338
01:33:46.455 --> 01:33:47.790
Know what time it is, Sid?

1339
01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:49.625
It's after midnight.

1340
01:33:50.334 --> 01:33:52.085
It's your mom's anniversary.

1341
01:33:52.836 --> 01:33:56.423
Congratulations. We killed her exactly
one year ago today.

1342
01:33:57.299 --> 01:33:58.675
Attention.

1343
01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:01.762
What do we have
behind door number three, Sidney?

1344
01:34:01.845 --> 01:34:04.640
-Daddy!
-Hold it. That's enough.

1345
01:34:06.016 --> 01:34:08.685
Guess we won't be needing
this anymore, huh?

1346
01:34:08.769 --> 01:34:10.854
And, oh, look at this. Ring, ring.

1347
01:34:10.938 --> 01:34:12.064
Won't need this.

1348
01:34:12.147 --> 01:34:13.732
Got the ending figured out yet, Sid?

1349
01:34:13.816 --> 01:34:15.984
Come on, Sidney,
you think about it now, huh?

1350
01:34:16.068 --> 01:34:19.029
Your daddy's the chief suspect.
We cloned his cellular.

1351
01:34:19.112 --> 01:34:21.073
Evidence is all right there, baby.

1352
01:34:21.156 --> 01:34:23.659
What if your father snapped,
your mother's anniversary set him off,

1353
01:34:23.742 --> 01:34:25.911
and he went on a murder spree
killing everyone?

1354
01:34:25.994 --> 01:34:28.247
Except for Billy and me.
We were left for dead.

1355
01:34:28.330 --> 01:34:33.210
Then he kills you
and shoots himself in the head.

1356
01:34:34.127 --> 01:34:35.212
Perfect ending.

1357
01:34:35.295 --> 01:34:37.089
I thought of that.

1358
01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:38.966
Watch this.

1359
01:34:43.846 --> 01:34:45.180
-You ready?
-Yeah.

1360
01:34:45.264 --> 01:34:49.393
Yeah! I'm ready, baby! Hit it!

1361
01:34:49.476 --> 01:34:52.271
Giddyap! Yeah, man! Giddyap! Hit it!

1362
01:34:57.067 --> 01:34:59.653
Good one, man! Jesus!

1363
01:34:59.736 --> 01:35:02.239
Oh, shit! My turn.

1364
01:35:06.285 --> 01:35:08.912
Don't forget.
Stay to the side and don't go too deep.

1365
01:35:10.247 --> 01:35:12.541
Okay. I'll remember.

1366
01:35:14.376 --> 01:35:15.502
Fuck!

1367
01:35:17.129 --> 01:35:19.047
Fuck! God damn it, Stu!

1368
01:35:19.715 --> 01:35:22.759
Sorry, Billy.
I guess I got a little too zealous, huh?

1369
01:35:24.052 --> 01:35:25.888
-Give me the knife.
-No.

1370
01:35:27.097 --> 01:35:28.307
Give me the knife!

1371
01:35:31.685 --> 01:35:33.020
Now!

1372
01:35:35.856 --> 01:35:40.652
You see, Sid? Everybody dies, but us.
Everybody dies, but us!

1373
01:35:40.736 --> 01:35:43.280
We get to carry on and plan the sequel

1374
01:35:43.363 --> 01:35:47.659
â€˜cause let's face it, baby,
these days, you gotta have a sequel!

1375
01:35:50.704 --> 01:35:53.290
You sick fucks.
You've seen one too many movies.

1376
01:35:53.373 --> 01:35:55.709
No, Sid, don't you blame the movies!

1377
01:35:55.792 --> 01:35:59.671
Movies don't create psychos.
Movies make psychos more creative!

1378
01:36:01.632 --> 01:36:04.551
Stop it, man, would you? All right?
I can't take any more.

1379
01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:07.471
I'm feeling a little woozy here!

1380
01:36:09.973 --> 01:36:10.974
All right.

1381
01:36:12.768 --> 01:36:15.896
You get the gun,
and I'll untie Pops, okay?

1382
01:36:19.316 --> 01:36:20.317
Now!

1383
01:36:21.485 --> 01:36:22.486
Okay.

1384
01:36:34.289 --> 01:36:37.918
Houston, we have a problem here.

1385
01:36:39.962 --> 01:36:41.046
What?

1386
01:36:41.129 --> 01:36:45.008
The gun, man. The gun.
I put it right here, and it's not there.

1387
01:36:46.259 --> 01:36:47.678
Where the fuck is it?

1388
01:36:47.761 --> 01:36:48.971
Right here, asshole.

1389
01:36:51.807 --> 01:36:55.894
-Man, I thought she was dead.
-She looked dead, man. Still does.

1390
01:36:55.978 --> 01:36:57.479
I've got an ending for you.

1391
01:36:57.562 --> 01:37:00.023
"The reporter left for dead
in the news van

1392
01:37:00.607 --> 01:37:05.070
comes to, stumbles on you two dipshits,

1393
01:37:05.946 --> 01:37:10.409
finds the gun,
foils your plan, and saves the day."

1394
01:37:12.244 --> 01:37:13.620
I like that ending.

1395
01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:17.165
I know something you don't.

1396
01:37:26.008 --> 01:37:27.217
Yeah, man!

1397
01:37:28.385 --> 01:37:29.386
Yeah.

1398
01:37:31.513 --> 01:37:32.848
So sweet.

1399
01:37:37.269 --> 01:37:39.438
Works better without the safety on.

1400
01:37:48.238 --> 01:37:50.449
"This is Gale Weathers, signing off."

1401
01:37:50.532 --> 01:37:52.617
Baby, you are gonna love this.

1402
01:37:54.786 --> 01:37:55.912
Shit.

1403
01:37:58.498 --> 01:37:59.499
What?

1404
01:38:06.214 --> 01:38:07.758
Where are they? Where are they?

1405
01:38:08.425 --> 01:38:10.635
I don't know, Billy, but I'm hurting, man!

1406
01:38:10.719 --> 01:38:11.762
Fuck!

1407
01:38:14.222 --> 01:38:15.807
Should I let the machine get it?

1408
01:38:17.851 --> 01:38:19.770
-Hello?
-Are you alone in the house?

1409
01:38:20.645 --> 01:38:23.023
Bitch! You bitch! Where the fuck are you?

1410
01:38:23.106 --> 01:38:25.859
Not so fast.
We're gonna play a little game.

1411
01:38:25.942 --> 01:38:27.652
It's called
Guess Who Just Called the Police

1412
01:38:27.736 --> 01:38:29.821
and Reported Your Sorry Motherfucking Ass!

1413
01:38:30.489 --> 01:38:32.365
Find her, you dipshit! Get up!

1414
01:38:32.449 --> 01:38:36.578
I can't, Billy. You cut me too deep.
I think I'm dying here, man.

1415
01:38:40.082 --> 01:38:41.917
Talk to her. Talk to her.

1416
01:38:49.091 --> 01:38:50.300
Hello?

1417
01:38:50.383 --> 01:38:54.471
Aw, Stu, Stu, Stu.
What's your motive? Billy's got one.

1418
01:38:54.554 --> 01:38:56.848
The police are on their way.
What are you gonna tell them?

1419
01:38:56.932 --> 01:38:59.309
Peer pressure. I'm far too sensitive--

1420
01:38:59.392 --> 01:39:02.020
I'm gonna rip you up, you bitch!
Just like your fucking mother!

1421
01:39:02.104 --> 01:39:04.564
You've gotta find me first,
you pansy-ass mama's boy!

1422
01:39:04.648 --> 01:39:05.649
Fuck!

1423
01:39:06.274 --> 01:39:08.568
Fucking hit me with the phone, dick!

1424
01:39:09.694 --> 01:39:10.862
Fucker, where are you?

1425
01:39:13.448 --> 01:39:14.449
You fuck!

1426
01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:18.411
Did you really call the police?

1427
01:39:18.495 --> 01:39:20.038
You bet your sorry ass I did.

1428
01:39:20.997 --> 01:39:24.334
My mom and dad are gonna be so mad at me.

1429
01:39:25.752 --> 01:39:26.753
Bitch!

1430
01:40:24.311 --> 01:40:25.312
My eyes!

1431
01:40:33.570 --> 01:40:35.989
I always had a thing for you, Sid!

1432
01:40:39.326 --> 01:40:40.535
God.

1433
01:40:41.703 --> 01:40:42.662
Bitch.

1434
01:40:43.747 --> 01:40:44.831
In your dreams.

1435
01:41:09.898 --> 01:41:11.733
Sid! I'm sorry. It's all right.

1436
01:41:11.816 --> 01:41:13.902
Oh, my God, Randy.
I thought you were dead.

1437
01:41:13.985 --> 01:41:16.947
I probably should be. I never thought
I'd be so happy to be a virgin.

1438
01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:19.241
Fucker!

1439
01:41:26.289 --> 01:41:27.832
Say hello to your mother.

1440
01:42:03.493 --> 01:42:04.494
It's okay.

1441
01:42:08.373 --> 01:42:11.167
Guess I remembered the safety that time,
you bastard.

1442
01:42:23.805 --> 01:42:24.806
Careful.

1443
01:42:25.390 --> 01:42:29.144
This is the moment when the supposedly
dead killer comes back to life

1444
01:42:29.227 --> 01:42:30.603
for one last scare.

1445
01:42:36.192 --> 01:42:37.569
Not in my movie.

1446
01:42:43.658 --> 01:42:44.784
Dad.

1447
01:42:45.869 --> 01:42:47.412
Randy, help me out.

1448
01:42:52.042 --> 01:42:53.084
Are you okay?

1449
01:42:56.171 --> 01:42:57.797
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1450
01:42:59.674 --> 01:43:01.509
-Hang in there, buddy.
-All right.

1451
01:43:03.470 --> 01:43:05.388
-It collapses.
-Where's Gale?

1452
01:43:06.514 --> 01:43:09.184
Okay, I think it's gonna go
something like this. Just stay with me.

1453
01:43:11.353 --> 01:43:14.731
Hi. This is Gale Weathers
with an exclusive eyewitness account

1454
01:43:14.814 --> 01:43:16.733
of this amazing breaking story.

1455
01:43:17.901 --> 01:43:22.364
Several more local teens are dead,
bringing to an end the harrowing mystery

1456
01:43:22.447 --> 01:43:25.784
of the mass killing
that has terrified this peaceful community

1457
01:43:25.867 --> 01:43:27.952
like the plot of some scary movie.

1458
01:43:28.661 --> 01:43:31.247
It all began with a scream over 911

1459
01:43:31.331 --> 01:43:35.001
and ended in a bloodbath
that has rocked the town of Woodsboro,

1460
01:43:35.627 --> 01:43:38.088
all played out here
in this peaceful farmhouse,

1461
01:43:38.171 --> 01:43:40.924
far from the crimes and the sirens
of the larger cities

1462
01:43:41.007 --> 01:43:42.926
that its residents have fled.

1463
01:43:43.009 --> 01:43:44.511
Okay, let's take it back to one.

1464
01:43:44.594 --> 01:43:47.222
Come on. Move it.
This is my big shot. Let's go.
