00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.920
Although your diplomas
are equally specific,

2
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.000
remember, you are all
going out into the world

3
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.240
as individuals.

4
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.640
I now proudly present

5
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.320
this year's
Woodrow Wilson School

and International Affairs

7
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.920
graduating class.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.480
<i>(all chant)</i>

10
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.800
Whoo!

11
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.160
Bye! We love you.

12
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.040
Write.
You have to write.

13
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.720
Thank your mom
for the cookies, OK?
Of course.

14
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.160
I'm very proud of you.

15
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.840
<i>(Mia) Dear Diary...</i>

16
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.520
<i>Well, it's me,</i>

17
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.240
<i>brand-new college graduate</i>
<i>slash princess.</i>

18
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.320
<i>Oh, I can't believe</i>
<i>it's been five years</i>

19
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.360
<i>since Grandma told me</i>
<i>that I was a princess.</i>

20
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.640
Me? A... A princess?

21
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.240
Shut up!

22
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.480
<i>And right after that,</i>
<i>my mother surprised me</i>

23
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.480
<i>by marrying</i>
<i>my high school teacher,</i>

24
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.840
<i>Patrick O'Connell.</i>

25
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.720
<i>It must be going well,</i>
<i>because they are now</i>
<i>expecting a baby.</i>

26
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.520
<i>Lilly's remained the same,</i>

27
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.360
as she continues
to cause turmoil,

28
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.200
<i>but now as a graduate student</i>
<i>at Berkeley,</i>

29
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.240
<i>which she calls "Berserkely."</i>

30
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.040
<i>How's Michael, you may ask?</i>

31
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.240
<i>Well, we're just friends now,</i>

32
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.240
<i>as he went off</i>
<i>to tour the country</i>
<i>with his band.</i>

33
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.640
Princess Mia,
look out the window

34
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.880
and welcome back
to Genovia.

35
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.680
<i>Oh, there it is,</i>
<i>my beautiful Genovia.</i>

36
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.240
<i>Of course</i>
<i>I'm completely excited</i>
<i>to be going back,</i>

37
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.240
<i>but I'm also a bit nervous.</i>

38
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.400
<i>(pilot over PA)</i>
<i>Genovia One has landed.</i>

39
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.640
<i>(Mia) Grandma Clarisse</i>
<i>will step down by the end</i>
<i>of this year as queen,</i>

40
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.560
<i>and I'll be taking over,</i>
<i>since I'm now 21.</i>

41
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.600
<i>Mira! La Princesa Mia!</i>

42
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.200
It's the princess
from America! Hi!

43
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.360
<i>(man) Mira!</i>
<i>La princesa!</i>

44
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.360
<i>I know I studied diplomacy</i>
<i>and political science</i>
<i>at school,</i>

45
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.680
<i>but there was</i>
<i>no course in "Queen"</i>

46
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.080
<i>or "How to Run a Country 101."</i>

47
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.080
<i>But Grandma's</i>
<i>going to help me,</i>

48
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.280
<i>and I'll take over</i>
<i>when she thinks I'm ready.</i>

49
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.680
<i>Of course, I wonder...</i>

50
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.840
<i>will I ever be ready?</i>

51
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.640
<i>In the meantime, I'm going to</i>
<i>live in a beautiful palace,</i>

52
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.280
<i>like in a fairy tale,</i>
<i>and eventually sit on a throne</i>

53
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.800
<i>and rule the people</i>
<i>of Genovia.</i>

54
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.160
<i>Is that scary or what?</i>

55
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.160
<i>Well, maybe Fat Louie</i>
<i>can give me some help.</i>

56
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.480
<i>(majordomo)</i>
Her Royal Highness,

57
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.640
Princess Amelia Mignonette
Thermopolis Renaldi,

58
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.240
has arrived.

59
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.600
Welcome home,
Princess.

60
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.160
<i>(meows)</i>

61
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.320
And her royal pussycat,
Sir Fat Louie.

62
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.120
<i>The one downer</i>
<i>in my fairy tale is...</i>

63
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.600
<i>I've never been in love.</i>

64
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.120
<i>(majordomo)</i>
Countess Puck of Austria.

65
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.800
<i>However, this evening is</i>
<i>my 21st birthday party,</i>

66
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.200
<i>and our tradition says</i>

67
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.240
<i>I have to dance with all</i>
<i>the eligible bachelors</i>
<i>in Genovia,</i>

68
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.840
<i>so maybe I'll meet</i>
<i>my Prince Charming tonight.</i>

69
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.280
The queen is coming.

70
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.160
Here she comes.
Look alive.

71
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.160
Places.

72
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.200
She'll have
a double-door entrance.

73
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.560
The eagle is flying.
Repeat, the eagle
is flying.

74
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.680
She's in the foyer.

75
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.920
Beautiful...

76
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.640
but you're late,
Your Majesty.

77
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.360
A queen is never late.

78
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.680
Everyone else
is simply early.

79
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.680
Of course.

80
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.640
<i>(majordomo)</i> Her Majesty,
Clarisse Renaldi,

81
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.720
Queen of Genovia.

<i>(laughs)</i>

84
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.800
Greetings, good friends.

85
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.920
I am delighted
to welcome you here
this evening.

86
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.720
Thanks for askin'.

87
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.840
Thank you.

88
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.400
I hope they have
string cheese.

89
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.880
Ah, good.

90
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.720
Many of you will remember

91
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.680
King Rupert's
and my granddaughter,
Princess Mia.

92
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.960
<i>(all)</i> King Rupert,
may he rest in peace.

93
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.000
Will you please
raise your glasses
in celebration

94
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.600
of Princess Mia's
21st birthday.

95
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.920
<i>(majordomo)</i> Presenting

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.760
Princess of Genovia.

98
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.320
<i>(drumroll)</i>

99
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.680
To Princess Mia.

100
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.920
<i>(all)</i> To Princess Mia.

101
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.880
It happens
all the time.

102

Ohh.

103
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.720
And happy birthday.
Thank you.

104
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.840

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.960
Oh, I don't speak Greek.

<i>(speaks Greek)</i>

108
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.720
And you obviously
don't speak English.

109
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.320
<i>(speaks Greek)</i>

110
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.480

1, 2...
Ohh!

114
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.320
Oh. Sorry.

115
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.080
<i>(speaking German)</i>

116
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.880
<i>(♪ jazz)</i>

117
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.840
Have you met
the princess yet?

118
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.040
Briefly, but she wasn't
very friendly.

119
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.320
<i>(Russian accent)</i> I got
a hello and a goodbye.

120
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.360
Is this
an American custom?

121
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.000
I saw that.

122
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.840
Um...

123
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.320
<i>(both squeal)</i>

124
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.840
Oh, how I've missed you!

125
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.720
Sebastian.
Your Majesty.

126
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.840
Sheila.
Majesty.

127
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.640
What have you been up to?

128
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.960
Just partying, girl,
you know.

129
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.920
Ohh! Oh, your foot!

130
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.600
I'm so sorry. Are y...
Are you all right?

131
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.680
I'll survive, Your Highness.

132
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.360
The fault was
entirely my own.

133
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.040
I apologize.

134
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.040
Are you sure you don't want
to exchange licenses

135
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.840
and proof of insurance?

136
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.400
No, no, these shoes
were a little big anyway,

137
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.440
and swelling should
help them fit better.

138
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.120
<i>(♪ tango)</i>

139
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.440
Whoa!

140
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.920
Aha.

141
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.040
Get a load
of this guy.

142
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.640
<i>(both giggle)</i>

143
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.880
Shimmy-shim.

144
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:52.400
Whoa, hey.
Hey, hey, hey...

145
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.400
You are
a beautiful dancer...

146
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.040
Oh, why,
thank you so much.

147
00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.600
...like a deer or a chipmunk
in the forest.

148
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.720
Looks like he's trying
to land a plane.

149
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.600
Woodland animals
are a lovely thing
to be compared to.

150
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.800
May I?

151
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.600
Your timing is impeccable.
Thank you.

152
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.080
You're welcome,
Your Highness.

153
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.760
Mia. I like
to be called Mia.
Mm.

154
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.760
And you are...?

155
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.960
Nicholas.
Just Nicholas.

156
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.960
Well, I'm very glad
to see that my clumsiness
hasn't affected your dancing.

157
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.760
I'm sorry I stepped
on your foot.

158
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.920
You can step on my foot
any time.

159
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.680
<i>(both)</i> Ohh.

160
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.760
It is
Prince Jacques' turn.

161
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.200
Your Highness.

162
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:56.640
If this were my party,
we'd be kissing by now.

163
00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.440
That's Prince Jacques.

164
00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.440
He's about 12 years old.

165
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.760
He's a very
precocious prince.

166
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.800
He wears aftershave
to make people think
that he's older.

167
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.720
May I blow in your ear?

168
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.040
Can you reach it?

169
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.520
Princess...
Hmm?

170
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.800
There's someone
from Parliament
you should meet, hmm?

171
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.920
Charlotte, how many members
of Parliament are there?

172
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.040
Only two left,
Your Highness.

173
00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.480
Ah. Hmm?

174
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.480
Aah! Oh, dear.
Your Highness,
pardon me.

175
00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.720
I am so sorry.
It was only an accident.

176
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.720
It's fine, it's fine.
No harm, no foul, no bruise.

177
00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.160
<i>(laughs)</i>
Thank you so much.

178
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.240
You should be more careful,
Your Royal Highness.

179
00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:39.160
Somebody might try
to take that away from you.

180
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.880
Oh, I hope not,
but thank you so much
for all your help.

181
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.040
Someone like me.

182
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.680
<i>Welcome back</i>
<i>to</i> Eggs With Elsie.

183
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.920
<i>I'm Elsie Kentworthy,</i>
<i>and today's topic</i>
<i>is Princess Mia...</i>

184
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.160
Oh, hi.
How's it going?

185
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.840
<i>(turns off TV)</i>

186
00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.840
I'm so sorry.
I thought I was alone.

187
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.680
No, miss. I'm Brigitte,
if it pleases you,
at your service.

188
00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.200
And I'm Brigitta,
miss.

189
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.160
Brigitte and Brigitta?

190
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.640
I'm Mia, and, please,
don't curtsy like that.

191
00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.840
Not like this?
How do you like it?
Like this, maybe?

192
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.640
No, no, no,
I didn't mean like,
you know, this...

193
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.880
No, no, not that way.
I didn't mean at, um...

194
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.160
The queen bids you
good morning, Princess.

195
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.160
She's in session
with Parliament.
OK.

196
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.000
I see you've met
your lady's maids.

197
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.280
Yeah. Um...
<i>(laughs)</i>

198
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.880
<i>(whispers)</i> How do you
turn off the curtsies?

199
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.880
Oh. Enough bowing.
Back to your chores.

200
00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.960
Her Majesty will meet you
in one hour at
the throne room.

201
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.160
OK.
I'm sorry your suite
isn't ready yet,

202
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.880
but you're welcome to stay
here in Her
Majesty's suite...

203
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.320
No, no, no, it's fine.

204
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.880
Hey, can I explore
the palace a little bit?

205
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.200
Of course.
<i>(dog barks)</i>

206
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.280
Well, you've met
Maurice.

207
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.640
<i>(barks)</i>

208
00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.160
Hey, Mo.

209
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.160
The throne room in an hour?

210
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.720
<i>(man)</i> The parliament
of Genovia is in session,

211
00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.280
Prime Minister Motaz
presiding.

212
00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.200
Viscount Mabrey,
you have the floor.

213
00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.840
<i>(man #2)</i> Sir Mabrey,
<i>s'il vous plait.</i>

214
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.080
As we all know,
the 21st birthday...

215
00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.240
<i>(snoring)</i>
...of an heir to
the Genovian bloodline

216
00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.200
is indeed a matter
of great public significance.

217
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.840
It signifies
that this young person

218
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.160
is eligible
to assume the crown.

219
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.240
Indeed, we are well aware
of this, Viscount.

220
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.760
The queen has
already indicated

221
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.040
that Princess Mia intends
to learn more at her side

222
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.640
before assuming the throne.

223
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.960
It was not Princess Mia
to whom I was referring.

224
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.080
Oh, wow.

225
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.680
King Chevalier was

226
00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:09.040
the great-great-
great-grandfather of...

227
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.800
Hello?

228
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.640
Uh... oh.

229
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.800
<i>(clears throat)</i>

230
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.080
Proceed.

231
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.080
<i>(gasps)</i>

232
00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.720
Nice.

233
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.240
Hello!

234
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.160
<i>(squeals)</i> OK.

235
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.840
Ooh.

236
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:59.720
<i>(Viscount Mabrey)</i> So,
as of the 20th of October
last year,

237
00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:04.200
on the occasion
of his 21st birthday,

238
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.720
another Genovian
of the royal bloodline

239
00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.120
became eligible
to assume the throne.

240
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.720
What?

241
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.040
My nephew,

242
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.720
Lord Devereaux.

243
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.200
I beg your pardon.

244
00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:21.200
My nephew's mother
was my wife's sister,

245
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.920
and therefore, Your Majesty,

246
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.040
I am pleased to say

247
00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.760
that my nephew is ready
to take his place

248
00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.280
as Genovia's rightful king.

249
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.480
Shut up.

250
00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.120
I beg your pardon?

251
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.360
I mean, um...

252
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.080
Uh, "shut up"
doesn't always mean...

253
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.480
shut up.

254
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.960
<i>(speaking</i>
<i>French)</i>

255
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.960
In America,
it's like
"Oh, my,"

256
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.120
"Gee whiz,"
"Wow."

257
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.280
Thank you,
Mr. Prime Minister.

258
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.320
But isn't Princess Mia
first in line to ascend
the throne?

259
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.880
Not yet.

260
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.520
Genovian law states

261
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.240
that a princess must marry
before she can
take the throne.

262
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.120
We have never enforced
that law.

263
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.880
A man doesn't have to marry
to be king.

264
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.000
This is the 21st century,
for heaven's sake.

265
00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.920
My granddaughter should be
given the same
rights as any man.

266
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.520
Yeah! <i>(gasps)</i>

267
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.760
Genovia shall have
no queen

268
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.480
lest she be bound
in matrimony.

269
00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.240
Lord Palimore.

270
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:34.960
That is the law of Genovia
for the last 300 years.

271
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.240
Princess Mia
is not qualified to rule
because she is unmarried.

272
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.960
And forgive me,
Your Majesty.

273
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.120
Not all of us are sure
that the princess

274
00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:50.800
is the most suitable choice
to govern our great nation.

275
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.800
<i>(men)</i> Ooh.

276
00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.880
Now, now, gentlemen,
gentlemen, please.

277
00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.480
I suggest
this honored body

278
00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.120
allow Princess Mia
one year,

279
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.200
during which time
she must marry,

280
00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.840
or she forfeits
the throne of Genovia

281
00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.840
to young Lord Devereaux.

282
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.000
What? No.

283
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.920
I object.
I object most strongly.

284
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.600
60 days.
2 months.

285
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.000
<i>(man)</i> 60 days?

286
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.560
30 days.

287
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.320
How could Parliament expect me
to fall in love in 30 days?

288
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.200
It's like...
It's like it's a big trick

289
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.000
to get me to have
an arranged marriage or...

290
00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.040
No. No, there's no...

291
00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.920
That's it. There's no or.

292
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.520
An arranged marriage
is my only choice.

293
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.920
What kind of person agrees
to an arranged marriage?

294
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.560
Uh... well, you agreed
to an arranged marriage.

295
00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.040
Right.

296
00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.960
Yes, I did,

297
00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.520
and it turned out
quite splendidly.

298
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.960
He was my best friend.

299
00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.360
We grew very fond
of each other.

300
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.960
Yeah, I'm sure, Grandma,
but...

301
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.360
I dream of love,
not fondness.

302
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.400
But you don't have to
do this, Mia.

303
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.720
You don't have to
become queen.

304
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.360
It's just so unfair.

305
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.600
<i>Amelia...</i>

306
00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.600
<i>(together)</i> ...courage is not
the absence of fear...

307
00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.600
<i>(Mia)</i> ...but rather
the judgment

308
00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.560
that something else
is more important

309
00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.040
than the fear.

310
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.320
There are 550 years
of Renaldis

311
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.640
on these walls,

312
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.080
and I will be up there
next to my father.

313
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:55.080
I'm sure I want my chance
to make a difference
as a ruler.

314
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.360
Spoken like a true queen.

315
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.920
You, my boy,

316
00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.280
a true-born Genovian,

317
00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.360
you should be our king.

318
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.240
I agree,

319
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.960
but... how can we
make it happen?

320
00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.960
Give me one of your arrows.

321
00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.240
I'm going to show you
a trick that I learnt

322
00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.560
from an old
Italian philosopher,

323
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.280
Niccolo Machiavelli.

324
00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.280
I can make this dart

325
00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:31.120
hit the bull's-eye every time.

326
00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.160
Haah!

327
00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.080
Yes, but...
that is cheating.

328
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.400
You've got it.

329
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.240
Lord Devereaux will be
arriving shortly,
Mrs. Cout,

330
00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.240
with his snake
of an uncle.
Yes, Your Majesty.

331
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.160
Your Majesty...
Hmm?

332
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.160
I know Lionel is
the Prime Minister's nephew,

333
00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.160
and he's interning
for the summer

334
00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.080
because he wants to learn
about security,

335
00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.760
but he never leaves my side.

336
00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.760
He sticks to me
like Velcro, madam.

337
00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.760
It won't last very long.

338
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.000
He returns to school
in the autumn.

339
00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.000
He wants an audience
with you.

340
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.560
What, now?
Now.

341
00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.600
Lionel?

342
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.760
Short.

343
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.560
I don't know if you've met
Mrs. Cout, our housekeeper,

344
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.080
and Priscilla and Olivia,
my lady's maids.

345
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.360
I'm doing a background check
on Olivia.

346
00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.640
Oh, that's not necessary,
Lionel.

347
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.640
Everybody in this room
has high-priority clearance.

348
00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.080
Of course, of course.

349
00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.640
Your Majesty.
Hmm?

350
00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.280
I would gladly
take a bullet for you.

351
00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.280
Oh, how brave.

352
00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.680
Most interns don't even want
to fetch me my tea.

353
00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.200
The limousine
is at the gates, madam.

354
00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.240
The viscount is not staying.
Just the nephew.

355
00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.240
Joseph, I want you
to protect him

356
00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.640
and keep your eye on him
at all times.

357
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.720
Of course.
Lionel.
Oh, hello.

358
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.240
So is this all right

359
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.680
to welcome the viscount
and his nephew?

360
00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.560
Very appropriate
and pretty.

361
00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.280
Oh, I can't believe Parliament
invited the guy who's trying
to steal the throne

362
00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.720
to stay here with us
at the palace.

363
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.720
Oh, no, Parliament
didn't invite him.

364
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.160
I did.
Wh...?

365
00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.680
I offered to have him
hung by his toes

366
00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.600
in our courtyard.

367
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.240
Excuse me.
Yeah. What about
Joe's suggestion?

368
00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.800
No. If there's any
mischief going on,

369
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.880
I'd prefer it be
right under my nose.

370
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.680
It's not a very difficult
job, you know.

371
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.680
You just have to open the door
before the passenger dies
of old age.

372
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.080
Hello. I'm here
to welcome you.

373
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.760
Your staff is incompetent
and unreliable.

374
00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.640
I just so don't want
to be nice to this guy.

375
00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.560
He is rude, he's arrogant
and self-centered, he's...

376
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.120
Have you met him?

377
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.640
I j... No.

378
00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.840
Neither have I.

379
00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.200
Yeah, but he probably is,
Grandma.

380
00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.840
I mean, like now,
all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

381
00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.200
he wants to be
the King of Genovia?

382
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.680
What is that about?

383
00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.400
Ohh, tush.

384
00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.440
Whatever he is,
we will be charm itself.

385
00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.200
We will present ourselves
with grace and poise.

Of course.

409
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.840
She's training to be
a flamenco dancer.

410
00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:36.320
Would you care to explain
what was going on out there?

411
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.760
Sorry.

412
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.360
I, uh, have met Lord Nicholas.

413
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.320
Actually, yep,
at the ball. Mm-hmm.

414
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.920
Didn't know who he was,
so, you know, we...
we danced,

415
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.360
and I flirted.

416
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.760
I feel so stupid right now.

417
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.720
I see.
Well, as your queen,

418
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.880
I absolutely
cannot condone it.

419
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.320

420
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.400

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.720
Now, if you'll come with me,
I have something to show you.

Oh, OK.

423
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.840
I think you could
leave that right there.

424
00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.080

we asked Rupert's cousin

429

to do the bathroom.

430

It's a good lesson.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.120
The wedding invitations
have been sent out.
Yes.

699
00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:55.840
She and Andrew
make a fine pair, I think.

700
00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.160
She's very set on it,
you know.

701
00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.560
Clarisse, my dear,
forget the wedding
for a moment.

702
00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.640
<i>(clears throat)</i>

703
00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.640
In less than a month,
you will no longer
be queen,

704
00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:11.080
and I will no longer be
your head of security.

705
00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:15.520
I think it's time
we bring our friendship
out of the shadows.

706
00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:19.040
Oh, Joseph, I...
Yes.

707
00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.880
Yes, my dear, I would kneel
if it weren't for my
knee replacement.

708
00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:27.720
Ohh... Oh, Joseph,
there's a wedding
to be planned.

709
00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.200
Mia needs to win over
the people of Genovia,

710
00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.680
all in less than 30 days.

711
00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.680
Perhaps
it's time to consider

712
00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.680
the duty you have
to yourself.

713
00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.280
Ohh...

714
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.880
Clarisse...

715
00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.560
my darling,
please think about it.

716
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.360
Please.

717
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.200

So, what are we

746
00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.080
We are learning
the art of the fan.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.160
Fascinating.
Yes.

748
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.120
Get up. We only have about
ten minutes in which
to communicate this.

749
00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.640
Now, first of all,

750
00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.800
one handles a fan
very deliberately.

751
00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.600
It's a tremendous tool
of communication.

752
00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.760
That's it.
You can say things like,

753
00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.840
"I'm feeling flirtatious.
Come hither."

754
00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.880
You can say, "I never wish
to speak to you again.

755
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.640
Go away."

756
00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.800
You can say, "I'm feeling
terribly shy today."

Oh, this is also a way

Yeah.

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.880
I can't ride

No, no, no, I couldn't

Oh, no, it's
a centuries-old idea.

823

Exactly.

Our ancestors knew
a thing or two, right?

so let's get it
really spooked, shall we?

833
00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.240
This is a fake snake.

835

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.200
No, you're not.

871
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.680
You never think about
anyone but yourself,
so just this once,

872
00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:05.680
can you please
let me be miserable

873
00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.320
and not make me feel worse
about myself?

874
00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.200
Just go away.
Go away from me.
Mia...

875
00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.520
Princess, excuse me.

876
00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.520
The queen has arrived.

877
00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.640
Yes.

878
00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:29.480
Nicholas, am I going to be
disappointed in you?

879
00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.400
<i>(footsteps)</i>

880
00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:34.480
Unfortunate incident, that.

881
00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:37.480
I'm just leaving.
You going to come
and see me off?

882
00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:40.640
I'd like to speak
with your uncle alone,
Nicholas, please.

883
00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:51.360
Viscount, you may not be aware
of what my job entails

884
00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:52.640
as the royal head of security.

885
00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.680
My job is to
protect the crown,

886
00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:58.120
to make sure no harm comes
to the crown,

887
00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:01.680
to step in when someone toys
with the crown's emotions,
you see.

888
00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:03.760
I think the entire country
understands

889
00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:06.720
how well you cater
for the crown's emotions.

890
00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.320
If you hurt my girl,

891
00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:14.720
you will answer
directly to me,

892
00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:18.120
and whatever crimes I commit
against you, remember,

893
00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:21.440
I have diplomatic immunity
in 46 countries,

894
00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.440
including Puerto Rico.

895
00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.600
Sir, you will find
that the word "fear"

896
00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:27.440
is not in my vocabulary.

897
00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.600
Perhaps...
but it's in your eyes.

898
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.440
You forgot something.

899
00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:42.280
<i>Au revoir, Pierre.</i>
<i>Remercie beaucoup.</i>

900
00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:43.600
<i>Tres bien,</i> Majesty.

901
00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:47.240
Nicholas, I... I want
to ask you a question.

902
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.640
Of course, Majesty.

903
00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:54.720
Why are you so against
Princess Mia being queen?

904
00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:57.600
My uncle feels
that Princess Mia
doesn't know the people.

905
00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.520
And you feel you do?
Know the people?

906
00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:03.280
Yes. I was born here,
I went to primary school here.

907
00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.440
I am a true Genovian.

908
00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:08.440
Mia didn't even know
she was Genovian
until high school,

909
00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.120
and to be frank, she's spent
little time here since then.

910
00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.280
Well, I happen to feel

911
00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:15.560
that she'll make
a great ruler.

912
00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:19.480
She's terribly bright,
sensitive, caring.

913
00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:22.280
I know that.
You do?

914
00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.760
Yes. Yes, I do,

915
00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:27.160
but, well, how can one
rule the people

916
00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:28.680
if they do not know
the people?

917
00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:32.360
Touch. That's
a very good question.

918
00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.320
<i>(♪ piano)</i>

919
00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.440
<i>(woman singing opera)</i>

920
00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:15.360
Opera's new rising star,
Anna Netrebko.

921
00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.560
Looks good enough to eat.

922
00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:19.680
<i>(laughter)</i>

923
00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:30.560
How are your grandchildren
Willy, Charlotte and Sam?

924
00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:32.720
They're wonderful.
Thank you for remembering.

925
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:36.400
How are you?
Good to see you.

926
00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.400
How's your dachshund?
Maury, right?

927
00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:42.400
He is great.
You remember him
from last time?

928
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.600
<i>Dobar dan,</i>
Lady Zrinka.

929
00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.200
<i>Dobar dan,</i>
Princess Mia.

930
00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.400
Mia's doing well.

931
00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:51.720
Some major mingling,
I see.

932
00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:56.400
A little higher,
Olivia.

933
00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.760
Mia, do you happen
to see who's here?

934
00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.480
No. Who?

935
00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:06.240
The king wannabe
with Lady Elissa.

936
00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:10.560
Oh. Is she his... girlfriend?

937
00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:12.560
Nicholas doesn't have
girlfriends.

938
00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:15.960
He has dates,
but attractive ones.

939
00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:17.960
You talk to him much?

940
00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:20.680
Uh, we acknowledge
each other.

941
00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:25.960
Andrew?

942
00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:27.520
Yes, dear. Coming.

943
00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.480
Guck.

944
00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:33.720
Well, the camera's
all ready to go, so...

945
00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:36.960
All right. Um...
let's go this way.
OK.

946
00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.360
Oh, well struck.

947
00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:42.320
You did very well, Mia.
Very charming.
Aw, thank you.

948
00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.600
Wait, wait, wait.
The light is perfect.
Just one more...

949
00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.800
Please, no more pictures.
Come on, please.

950
00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:50.240
It's very flattering,
but...
Mia, one more picture.

951
00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:51.400
<i>(camera beeps)</i>

952
00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:54.360
Ah.

953
00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.800
Hello. Uh, I'm, uh,
Andrew Jacoby.

954
00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.360
Oh, hello.
Lady Elissa.

955
00:47:58.480 --> 00:47:59.360
Pleasure.

956
00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:00.400
Lady Elissa.

957
00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.640
Your Highness.

958
00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:02.800
Hello.

959
00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:04.800
Elissa and I
were just discussing

960
00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.520
her latest achievement.

961
00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:08.440
She's received
the Rhodes scholarship.

962
00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:09.800
Nicholas, please.
Why not brag?

963
00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:11.520
You're an amazing woman.

964
00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:13.640
Elissa, congratulations.

965
00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:17.800
You know, Andrew has a PhD
in anthropology from Oxford.

966
00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:19.320
Fantastic.

967
00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:21.280
Elissa was in the Peace Corps.

968
00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:22.520
Really?

969
00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.560
Andrew spent four months
in Papua New Guinea

970
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.560
studying the bark
of a yam tree.

971
00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:28.720
Uh, Andrew...
Elissa
single-handedly...

972
00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:31.680
Elissa is actually trying
to say something.
Yes, Lady Elissa?

973
00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.680
Andrew, would you like
to get a drink?

974
00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.680
I have a feeling
they're going to start

975
00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.520
a "my horse is bigger
than your horse" run.

976
00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.600
I would absolutely love to.
Excuse us.

977
00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.600
No, her horse
actually is very huge.

978
00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.520
<i>(Elissa)</i> Oh, really?
Yes.

979
00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:48.040
S... Mm.

980
00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.440
Fantastic party.
It is.

981
00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:52.320
You two make
such a lovely couple.

982
00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:54.320
We do, yeah.

983
00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:56.640
It's a shame you're not
attracted to him.
I know. It...

984
00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:59.680
You... I...

You can't just say
something like that
and walk away.

991
00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:28.000
I will have you know
that I am very attracted
to Andrew.

992
00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.520
Well, obviously.

993
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:30.880
I am. He's...

994
00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:33.720
We are perfect
for each other.
He understands me.

995
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:36.520
Understands you?
Wow. What passion.

996
00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:38.560
I didn't hear you
mention love.

997
00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:40.560
You are so jealous.

998
00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.560
Why would I be jealous
of Andrew?

999
00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:46.080
He's got to spend
the rest of his life
married to you.

1000
00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:47.840
I loathe you.

What... What are you doing?
What is wrong with you?

1006
00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:07.000
You can't just go around
kissing people,

1007
00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:08.760
particularly not
engaged people.

1008
00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.480
You enjoyed it.
You wanna kiss again?
Well, I... No!

1009
00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.080
Stop trying
to confuse me.

1010
00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.480
What's confusing
about a kiss?

1011
00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.480
You're just trying
to make me like you

1012
00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:18.480
so that I won't want
to marry Andrew

1013
00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.080
and so that you
can have the crown. Ah!

1014
00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.120
Well, maybe I am and...

1015
00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:24.120
maybe I just
like kissing you.

1016
00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:26.600
You... You stay away
from me! Aah!

1017
00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.240
Aah!

1018
00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:31.680
Mia...

1019
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.520
You know what?
I have an idea.

1020
00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.120
I have a great idea.

1021
00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:38.120
Why don't you go underwater,
and I'll count to a million.

1022
00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.160
Mia, careful. Mia.

1023
00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:49.800
Do I want to know?

1024
00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:53.040
I don't think so.
Mm.

1025
00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:57.720
I'll be two seconds, Mia.

1026
00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.560
She's going to be
a handful, isn't she?

1027
00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.480
You'll never be bored,
Andrew.

1028
00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:04.720
Yes.

1029
00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:09.720
Olivia, enough goodbyes.
Yes, ma'am.

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:11.720
Eagle is leaving.
Eagle is leaving.

1031
00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:13.600
In hushed tones, Lionel.

1032
00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:15.680
Hushed tones.

1033
00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:23.680
When are you going to start
acting responsibly?

1034
00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:27.560
Hiding in a closet with a man
who is not your betrothed?

1035
00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:30.520
Coming out of a fountain
dripping wet

1036
00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:33.680
with the same man
who is not your betrothed?

1037
00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.160
Do you think I plan for
this kind of stuff to happen?

1038
00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:38.560
I lost it.
Sometimes you just lose it.

1039
00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:41.240
You can't afford to lose it.
Other people lose it.

1040
00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:43.160
We're supposed to find it.

1041
00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.840
People look up to us,

1042
00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:47.480
and we're held to
higher standards of behavior.

1043
00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:50.120
Can you try to grasp
that concept?

1044
00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.240
The concept is grasped.

1045
00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:55.240
The execution is...
a little elusive.

1046
00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:57.640
I would say so.

You'll want to look fresh
for the parade tomorrow.

it's just you and I.

1057

Big parade day.

Why do you talk
like that?

1064
00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:52.600
I'm... Captain Kip Kelly
of the Royal Guard.

1065
00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:54.600
What if we all talked
like that?

1066
00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:55.760
Lilly Moscovitz,

Flag? Welcome.

1074
00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:16.600
Welcome, Viscount Mabrey.
May I offer you a flag?

1075
00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:18.840
Thank you. I am not
a waving aficionado.

1076
00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:23.120
But I will wave
our national flag

1077
00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:28.040
when a true Genovian king
once again sits on the throne.

1078
00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:30.880
King Nicholas, hmm?

1079
00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:32.200
Flag?

1080
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:34.320
How do you feel today,
my dear?

1081
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:37.360
Honestly, Joe,
not that great.

1082
00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:40.320
Would you feel better
if you called me Joey?

1083
00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:42.640
No, Joe.
Good.

1084
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.320
Come on, Joseph,
we're already late.

1085
00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.320
Her Majesty is ready.

1086
00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:49.640
Can't keep
the people of Genovia
waiting any longer.

1087
00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:53.800
Happy Independence Day,
Genovia.

1088
00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:55.840
Here we are in Pyris,
capital of Genovia,

1089
00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:57.320
for the big annual parade.

1090
00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.160

the Lippitz

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:52.720

the parade.

00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:54.200

What's your name?

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.160
Carolina.

Blake.
John.

1120
00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:17.320
Did I see you messing
with Carolina?

1121
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:19.760
They were tugging
on my braids.

1122
00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:21.680
Mm.

1123

Excuse me.
These children are...?

1124
00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.360
Most of them are orphans.

1125
00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.320
We care for as many
as possible.

1126
00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:29.360
Oh.

1127
00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:34.080
Kissing children.

1128
00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:35.720
Hugging orphans.

1129
00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:39.800
What a vulgar,
low, despicable
political trick.

1130
00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:42.800
Carolina...

1131
00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.160
would you like to be
a princess today?

1132
00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:48.160
I can't. I'm too little,
too <i>piccola.</i>

1133
00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:50.200
Oh, no, because I declare

1134
00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:53.360
that anyone can be
a princess today.

1135
00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.120
Well, why don't we
get you a tiara,

1136
00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:58.160
and you can wave
and march in the parade.

1137
00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:00.760
In fact, why don't you
all take tiaras?

1138
00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:03.400
All? Give them all
free tiaras?

1139
00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.760

Of course, of course.

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:27.120
We could always use
more princes in the world.

1150
00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:28.920
OK, so...

1151
00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:31.480
to be a princess,

1152
00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:35.160
you have to believe
that you're a princess.

1153
00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:38.400
You've gotta walk the way
you think a princess
would walk,

1154
00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:39.400
so think tall.

1155
00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:42.160
You've gotta smile and wave

1156
00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:43.160
and just have fun.

1157
00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:44.240

<i>(Mia)</i> And so, gentlemen,
the children from the shelter

at the winter castle

1195
00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.200
in the mountains of Libbet.

1196
00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:10.200
The use of the castle
as a resort

1197
00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:13.520
is sort of a perk
for Parliament members
and dignitaries.

1198
00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:15.440
Exactly.
Ah.

1199
00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:17.600
Well, I'm going
to de-perk it

1200
00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:19.640
and convert it
into a children's shelter

1201
00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:22.080
until money can be raised
for one of their own.

1202
00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:24.640
I feel guilty
having two homes
while they have none.

00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:31.080
I don't speak
to my brother.

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.520
Gretchen, hot water.

1387
01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:24.440
What are you saying?

1388
01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.800
She's... she's smart,

1389
01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:28.080
and she really
cares about Genovia.

1390
01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:30.520
Maybe... well, maybe
it wouldn't be so bad

1391
01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.560
if she ran the country.

1392
01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.520
Are you mad?

1393
01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:37.080
She believes in Genovia so
much that she's
convinced herself

1394
01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.720
to marry someone that she
knows she can never love.

1395
01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.520
I can't believe
that I'm hearing this.

1396
01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:44.400
You want her to rule?

1397
01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:48.480
After all the effort
that we have put in,
to end up with nothing?

1398
01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:49.760
It wouldn't be nothing.

1399
01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:51.760
Genovia would be
in good hands,

1400
01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.640
and she would be happy.

1401
01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:58.000
Ah... you've
fallen in love
with her.

1402
01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.400
No. No.

1403
01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:01.600
Uncle, all that I ask...

1404
01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:05.600
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You listen.

1405
01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.600
What do you think
will happen, hmm?

1406
01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.600
That she will leave Andrew
and marry you?

1407
01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.600
I put in the effort
to make you a king,

1408
01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:15.600
not to have you marry a queen.
I will not have it, sir.

1409
01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:18.080
Don't worry, Uncle.
That will never happen.

1410
01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.080
Mia doesn't care for me
that way.

1411
01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.800
Oh, but you care for her.

1412
01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:25.000
Uncle, I just want us to stop
trying to sabotage her.

1413
01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.640
That's all.

1414
01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.640
All right.

1415
01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:34.520
If that's what
you really want.

1416
01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.760
I just want your happiness,
my boy.

1417
01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:44.560
Go to her, hmm?

1418
01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.480
Congratulate her

1419
01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.640
and tell her
that we surrender.

1420
01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:51.480
Thank you, Uncle.

1421
01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:05.280

1438
01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:01.640
Andrew, why don't you
go introduce Lilly
to your parents?

1439
01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.080
Just tell them
I'll be up for brunch
in a second.

1440
01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:07.240
Yeah, I'd love to meet
Susan and Arnold.

We can have those tasty

Would you like some help?

1443
01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:14.640
He's not the one
she's marrying, is he?

1444
01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:16.640
Would you please try
to keep up, Brigitta?

1445
01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:19.120

Relax this hand.

give them some privacy.

I think it's time
I bowed out gracefully.

Could I see you one more time

01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:14.200
Good. Sit up.

1730
01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:16.640
She kinda does look
like a poodle.

1731
01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:20.120
I like it.

1732
01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:26.600
This time I'm so sure,
I use my own pictures.

1733
01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:30.320
So, <i>un, deux, trois.</i>

1734
01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:33.440
<i>(Mabrey)</i> Gretchen,
I can't find my gloves.

1735
01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:35.600
You go on.

1736
01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:38.360
I think it would be better
if I didn't go to the wedding.

1737
01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:41.200
My boy.

1738
01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:43.360
Don't give up so easily.

1739
01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:45.360
Come to church.
Sweep her off her feet.

1740
01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:48.080
In a week or two,
she'll be yours.

1741
01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:51.200
The game is over, Uncle.
She's going to marry Andrew.

1742
01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:52.720
Ah, you're so right.

1743
01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:55.120
Ah, well, this is
a disaster in the making.

1744
01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:56.800
Wouldn't miss
a moment of it.

1745
01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:02.720
I'll try to catch
the garter. Ha-ha!

1746
01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:05.280
The royal carriage approaches!

1747
01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:06.840
What did he say, Artie?

1748
01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:09.200
The princess is coming.
Show time.

1749
01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:13.680
Suki Sanchez here
from the USA.

1750
01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:16.320
a long way from home,
but happily following

1751
01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:18.360
a story that started
in the streets of
San Francisco

1752
01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:20.440
and is about to have
a happy ending here

1753
01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:24.160
in the small beautiful land
of Genovia.

1754
01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:27.920
<i>(captain)</i> Prepare
for the arrival
of Princess Mia!

1755
01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:34.320
Psst.

1756
01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:36.160
Sir...

1757
01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:38.240
I don't mean
to talk out of school,

1758
01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:42.120
but there's something
you must know.

1759
01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:46.640
Your uncle called Elsie
and set you up
with that video.

1760
01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:50.240
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I should have known.

1761
01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:52.120
He's up to something.

1762
01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:55.120
He was much too delighted
that you aren't going
to that wedding.

1763
01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:57.120
I must get to that church.
Yes, yes, but how?

1764
01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:00.120
Everything on four wheels
is already rented
for the wedding.

1765
01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:01.840
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I'll run.

1766
01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:03.320
No. No, it's too far.

1767
01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:06.360
No. You'll take the bike.

1768
01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:08.720
The bike? Gretchen, what bike?
We don't have a bike.

1769
01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:11.800
Your grandfather's bike.

1770
01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:21.400
<i>Buenas tardes,</i>
Tanya.

1771
01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:23.240
<i>Buenas tardes,</i>
<i>Su Majestad.</i>

1772
01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:26.320
<i>Aqu le presento mi tio</i>
<i>que noviecita de Rosario.</i>

1773
01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:27.720
Oh, how do you do,
seor?

1774
01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:30.320
Oh, I do better
if you and I
get married.

1775
01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.840
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

1776
01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:33.880
I'm sorry.

1777
01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:36.240
My uncle
learned his English

1778
01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:37.880
watching the old
<i>Three Stooges</i> movies.

1779
01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:38.960
Sorry.
Ooh!

1780
01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:45.360
Yes, well...

1781
01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:46.800
What...?

1782
01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:49.440
You're not going
to believe this.

1783
01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:51.880
Lord Devereaux is riding
up the road on a bicycle.

1784
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.360
Sir! Sir, may I borrow
your horse?

1785
01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:56.880
Oh, he needs my horse.

1786
01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:00.240
My bike is yours.

1787
01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:03.040
How am I supposed
to herd sheep
with a bike?

1788
01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:11.280
<i>(♪ processional music)</i>

1789
01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:25.720
Outspoken American activist
Lilly Moscovitz,

1790
01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:27.360
the maid of honor,

1791
01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:30.960
glides forward
as a vision in pink.

1792
01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:35.240
I'm a girl who loves black
and is wearing pink.

1793
01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:37.920
Aw.
Ohh.

1794
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.400
<i>(Elsie)</i> And Duke Andrew's
little nephew Viscount Ludlow,

affectionately known
as James of the cherub cheeks,

1796
01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:48.760
comes down the aisle
as the royal ring bearer.

1797
01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:54.000
<i>(whispers)</i> Hey, Joe.
Hmm?

1798
01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:57.960
I just wanted to say
before I do this,

1799
01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:00.640
I'm sorry you're retiring.

1800
01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:02.440
Who told you that?

1801
01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.640
The maids know everything.

1802
01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:07.040
Mm.

1803
01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:08.960
Well, the heart
does things for reasons

1804
01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:11.040
that reason
cannot understand.

1805
01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:15.040
You're preaching
to the choir.

1806
01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:18.080
<i>(knocks)</i>

1807
01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:19.080
Princess?

1808
01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:21.920
Yes?

1809
01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:26.080
Then you should know
that Nicholas did not
set you up at the lake.

1810
01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.920
You're sure?

1811
01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:34.000
The maids know everything.

1812
01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:38.040
We're ready
when she is.

1813
01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:43.120

No.

a minute or two.

01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:54.760
Thank you, Your Highness.

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:04.760
Let me.

Honey, I'll be right back.

1832
01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:18.720
I gotta change
Trevor's diaper.

1833
01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:20.760
Please be seated.

1834
01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:22.760
There'll just be
a momentary interlude.

1835
01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:23.920
Thank you.

1836
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.520
Do we
rush after her?

1837
01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:28.720
No, we never rush.
We hasten.

1838
01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:30.400
You'll take care of them.

Oh, my dear. Mia.

No, Grandma, I'm sorry.

1846
01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:49.920
I'm so sorry.
I-I-I just need a minute.

1847
01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:51.080
No.
I can do this.

No.

01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:54.920
I can't do this.
I know.

1850
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Darling,
listen to me.

1851
01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:01.680
I made my choice...

1852
01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:04.240
duty to my country
over love.

1853
01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:06.960
It's what I've always done,
it seems.

1854
01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:09.200
It was drummed into me
my whole life.

1855
01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:12.840
Now I've lost the only man
I ever really loved.

Mia, I want you to make
your choices as a woman.

Don't make
the same mistakes I did.

Make your own mistakes.

1861
01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:27.680
There'll be plenty
of them, believe me.

1862
01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:29.920
Now, you can go back
into that church
and get married,

1863
01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:31.000
or you can walk away.

1864

is tell Mummy.

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.920
I have to tell everyone else.

Welcome.

1891
01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:03.920
A few moments ago,
I realized the only reason

1892
01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.720
I was getting married
was because of a law,

1893
01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:09.120
and that didn't seem
like a good enough reason,

1894
01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:12.320
so I won't be
getting married today.

1895
01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:15.960
Sit. Sit.
There may be a dinner.

1896
01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:22.960
My grandmother has ruled
without a man at her side
for quite some time,

1897
01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:27.640
and I think she rocks at it.

1898
01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:30.560
so as the granddaughter
of Queen Clarisse

1899
01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:31.880

01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:35.080
<i>(all)</i> King Rupert,
may he rest in peace.

1901
01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:37.800
...I ask the members
of Parliament to...

1902
01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:40.560
to think about your daughters,

1903
01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:42.920
your nieces, sisters

1904
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.800
and granddaughters,

1905
01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:47.880
and ask yourselves...

1906
01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:49.920
would you force them to do

1907
01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.600
what you're trying
to make me do?

1908
01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:58.800
I believe I will be
a great queen.

1909
01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:00.800
<i>I understand Genovia</i>
<i>to be a land</i>

1910
01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:02.800
<i>that combines</i>
<i>the beauty of the past</i>

1911
01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:05.880
<i>with all the best hope</i>
<i>of the future.</i>

1912
01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:07.800
Not now.
<i>(women)</i> Shh!

1913
01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:09.800
<i>I feel in my heart and soul</i>

1914
01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:12.560
that I can rule Genovia.

1915
01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:14.960
I... I love Genovia.

1916
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.520
Do you think that I would
be up here in a wedding dress
if I didn't?

1917
01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:20.560
<i>(laughter)</i>

1918
01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:23.800
I stand here...

1919
01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:27.760
ready to take my place
as your queen...

1920
01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:30.640
without a husband.

1921
01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:33.040
<i>(woman) Viva, Mia!</i>

1922
01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:43.680
Every time...

1923
01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:48.000
Every time this charming
young lady opens her mouth,

1924
01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:51.680
she demonstrates a contempt

1925
01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:54.000
for the customs of Genovia.

1926
01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:56.840
The law clearly states

1927
01:35:56.920 --> 01:36:01.520
an unmarried woman
cannot be queen.

1928
01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:03.840
Fortunately,

1929
01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:06.640
there is another heir.

1930
01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:08.480
No, there is not.

1931
01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:10.560
<i>(crowd murmuring)</i>

1932
01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:11.800
I decline.

1933
01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:13.800
I refuse to be king.

1934
01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:16.560
Ladies and gentlemen,

1935
01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:19.560
it is Princess Mia
who should have the crown.

1936
01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:22.680
She is bright
and she is caring,

1937
01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:25.880
but more importantly,
she has a vision,

1938
01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:27.840
one that will
take Genovia forward,

1939
01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:30.560
and if the Parliament
were astute,

1940
01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:32.440
they would name her queen.

1941
01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:33.960
Listen to her.

1942
01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:37.480
She'll lead us
into the 21st century.

1943
01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:39.480
And besides,

1944
01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:42.560
just think
how lovely she'll look
on our postage stamp.

1945
01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:43.960
<i>(laughter)</i>

1946
01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:47.000
Lovely on a postage stamp?!

1947
01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:49.800
You would look lovely
on a postage stamp!

1948
01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:51.560
And don't you walk
away from me, sir!

1949
01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:53.760
You have a duty, sir,
to Genovia!

1950
01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:59.560
He's, uh,
he is very distressed.

1951
01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:01.880
Your duty, sir,
to the country,
to me, sir!

1952
01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:04.880
To Genovia!

1953
01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:06.240
To your father!

1954
01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:07.600
Nicholas!

1955
01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:10.920
The door.
Shut the doors, quickly.

1956
01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:13.600
Nicholas! Nicholas!

1957
01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:16.880
Nicholas, I cannot have you
giving all-all this up
just for a girl.

1958
01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:19.680
Now-Now, we can...
Enough, Uncle.

1959
01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:21.800
We're finished.

1960
01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:26.000
What is happening here?

1961
01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:28.720
Who's next in line
for the throne,
the Von Trokens?

1962
01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:29.880
We accept!

1963
01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:31.960
Sit down!

1964
01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:36.960
<i>(coughs)</i> Make a motion.

1965
01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:38.720
Are you OK?

1966
01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.120
Make a motion!
<i>(coughs)</i>

1967
01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:43.600
Ah, um, Prime Minister...

1968
01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:45.280
Yes, Princess?

1969
01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:48.080
I move to abolish
the marriage law

1970
01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:53.000
as it applies to present
and future queens of Genovia.

1971
01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:56.920
Will anyone second my motion?

1972
01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:59.920
Just keep
eye contact with them.

1973
01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:02.600
Stare them down.

1974
01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:06.040
N-N-N... soften,
soften. Good.

1975
01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:15.960
Ahem. I second the motion.

1976
01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:21.680
It's time we had
a new tradition.
I like change.

1977
01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:23.720
I may grow a moustache.

1978
01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:25.720
I think you'd
look marvelous
with a moustache.

1979
01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:27.080
My father always favored
a Van Dyke....

1980
01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:28.840
Gentlemen, please.

1981
01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:30.840
All those in favor

1982
01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:33.320
of abolishing
the marriage rule,

1983
01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:34.920
say, "Aye."

1984
01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:39.280
Aye.

1985
01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:42.000
Aye.

1986
01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:43.000
Aye.

1987
01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:44.840
Aye.

1988
01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:47.600
You're not in Parliament.
Sit down.
Someday.

1989
01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:49.680
<i>(all)</i> Aye.

1990
01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:52.600
The "ayes" have it.

1991
01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:55.360
Congratulations, Princess.

1992
01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:58.440
If I may say so myself,
you rule!

1993
01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:10.800
Lionel...

1994
01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:14.280
Your Majesty...

1995
01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:15.800
Hmm?

1996
01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:18.800
The princess
would like a word.

1997
01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:22.800
Oh. Um...

1998
01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:30.720
Grandma... just because I
didn't get my
fairy-tale ending

1999
01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:32.800
doesn't mean you shouldn't.

2000
01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:37.880
Oh, uh, did you hear that?

2001
01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:40.840
Not if you didn't
want me to.

2002
01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:42.800
Oh, Charlotte.
Uh...

2003
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.400
Oh...

2004
01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:48.920
Ahem... well...

2005
01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:57.000
Joseph...

2006
01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:58.880
Your Majesty.

2007
01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:03.080
Dear Joseph...

2008
01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:09.280
Am I too late to ask you

2009
01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:13.680
to accept
my hand in marriage?

2010
01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:14.760
Ahem.

2011
01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:19.320
Well, I thought
you'd never ask.

2012
01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:23.920
Shades, you're in charge now.

2013
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.040
Good luck with Lionel.

2014
01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:28.960
I'm going to a wedding.

2015
01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:31.280
Open up, I say!
The door is shut!

2016
01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:33.440
<i>Let me in!</i>

2017
01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:35.760
<i>(Gretchen laughs)</i>

2018
01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:38.000
<i>Put me down. Put me down!</i>

2019
01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:46.480
Ha-ha-ha.

2020
01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:50.120
I know it was
short notice,

2021
01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:52.840
but you were all dressed.

2022
01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:54.800
<i>(guests murmur)</i>

2023
01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.720
My Lord Archbishop,

2024
01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:03.760
I would like to take this man
as my husband, if you please.

2025
01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:05.840
Finally.

2026
01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:10.080
We have come together
for a different wedding.

2027
01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:11.760
What did I miss?
She's not getting married.

2028
01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:13.000
She's not getting married?
No.

2029
01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:19.480
With this ring,
I thee... finally wed.

2030
01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:21.000
Now the queen's
getting married.

2031
01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:22.800
The queen's getting married?
Yeah, to Joe.

2032
01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:26.480
I pronounce you
man and wife.

2033
01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:28.840
You may kiss the bride.

2034
01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:32.440
<i>(organ plays/choir sings)</i>

2035
01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:33.120
<i>(applause)</i>

2036
01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:37.920
Whoo-hoo!
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

2037
01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:49.760
<i>(majordomo)</i> The ceremonial

through the coronation ring.

2039
01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:21.200
Good morning.
It's been almost a week
since the almost-wedding,

2040
01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:24.200
and busy workers are setting
up for Genovia's grand day,

2041
01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:27.080
the coronation
of a new queen.

2042
01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:29.440
Somewhere in the palace,
Princess Mia's getting ready

2043
01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:33.120
for the ceremony that will
change her life forever.

2044
01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:38.720
So what do you say, Fat Louie?

2045
01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:41.080
You think I'll make
a good queen?

2046
01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:44.720
Indeed you will.

2047
01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:48.400
If I may be so bold,

2048
01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:51.040
I would like an audience
with Your Highness.

2049
01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:52.120
Uh...

2050
01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:00.440
What is your dilemma,
young man?

2051
01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:03.680
You are, in fact.

2052
01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:10.960
I am in love
with the queen-to-be,

2053
01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:14.120
and I am inquiring
if she loves me, too.

2054
01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:19.600
Do you have a chicken
for my table?

2055
01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:24.320
No, no. My kitchen
is out of chickens.

2056
01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:26.400
Ah... hmm.

2057
01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:36.720
Mia.

2058
01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:57.600
<i>(captain)</i> Company, attention!

2059
01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:01.040

01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:25.360
I heard you're going back
to Berkeley to finish up
graduate school.

2067
01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:26.600
You heard right.

2068
01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:29.480
May I call you
in California?

2069
01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:33.200
I think I can hear you
without a phone, but, uh...

2070
01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:44.160
The sparrow is taking off.

2071
01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:48.760
The eagle is flying
for the last time.

2072
01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:49.560
She looks beautiful.

2073
01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:51.560
<i>(breaking up)</i>
They both do.

01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:01.600
