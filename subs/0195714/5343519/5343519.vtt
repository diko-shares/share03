1
00:03:02.427 --> 00:03:03.394
Alex.

2
00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:08.388
Tod and George's dad just called.
He's picking you up at 3:30 tomorrow,

3
00:03:08.433 --> 00:03:11.402
and the bus leaves the high school
for the airport around 5.

4
00:03:11.436 --> 00:03:14.405
How's my suitcase working out for you?

5
00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.407
Momma, Momma, you gotta leave that on.

6
00:03:16.441 --> 00:03:19.410
Yeah, it's like, you know....

7
00:03:19.444 --> 00:03:21.412
Tag made the last flight without
the plane crashing or anything,

8
00:03:21.446 --> 00:03:26.406
so I figured it's gotta be
on the bag or at least with the bag...

9
00:03:26.451 --> 00:03:27.418
for luck.

10
00:03:27.452 --> 00:03:30.421
Where would you get
a nut ball idea like that?

11
00:03:30.455 --> 00:03:32.423
I'm still here.

12
00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:40.420
So... 17 on the loose.

13
00:03:40.465 --> 00:03:45.425
Senior trip with your friends in Paris,
10 days in the springtime.

14
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.430
Live it up, Alex.
You got your whole life ahead of you.

15
00:04:34.452 --> 00:04:37.421
<i>Alex?
Alex?</i>

16
00:04:56.474 --> 00:04:59.443
<i>The white zone is for
immediate loading and</i>

17
00:04:59.477 --> 00:05:03.379
<i>unloading of passengers only.
No parking.</i>

18
00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.387
- Hey, Hitchcock.
- What?

19
00:05:10.421 --> 00:05:12.389
- Lemme give you a hand with this, man.
- No, I...

20
00:05:12.423 --> 00:05:14.391
- There you go.
- Carter, you dick.

21
00:05:14.925 --> 00:05:15.892
Good one.

22
00:05:17.428 --> 00:05:20.397
- You left this on the bus.
- Oh, thanks.

23
00:05:20.431 --> 00:05:22.399
Come on, let's get your stuff together.

24
00:05:22.433 --> 00:05:25.402
Hey, Christa.
Hi, Blake.

25
00:05:25.436 --> 00:05:28.405
- What are you doing?
- He's the man, the man!

26
00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:32.398
- All right, you guys got everything?
- Yeah, yeah, Dad, we're all set.

27
00:05:32.443 --> 00:05:35.412
<i>Les eudiants, allons-y en France.</i>

28
00:05:35.446 --> 00:05:37.414
Does that mean go?

29
00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.417
Don't know.

30
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:43.420
Look, this is for both of you.
All right?

31
00:05:43.454 --> 00:05:45.422
- Have a great time.
- Thanks, Dad.

32
00:05:45.456 --> 00:05:46.423
- Yeah.
- Both of us.

33
00:05:46.457 --> 00:05:47.424
- Let's go.
- Okay?

34
00:05:47.458 --> 00:05:48.425
- Alex.
- Yes.

35
00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:51.428
- You take care of 'em.
- I will.

36
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.371
I didn't think anything could
look worse than my yearbook photo.

37
00:06:02.407 --> 00:06:05.376
How do you think I feel
having to look at you all the time?

38
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.379
<i>Avis aux passagers.
Avis aux passagers.</i>

39
00:06:08.413 --> 00:06:11.382
<i>Les enfants. Ecoutez.
Excusez-moi. Ecoutez.</i>

40
00:06:11.416 --> 00:06:14.385
<i>Qu'est ce que c'est I'annonce?</i>

41
00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.387
What the fuck does he want?

42
00:06:16.421 --> 00:06:19.390
<i>Cet aeoport n'est pas reponsable
pour leurs activite. Merci.</i>

43
00:06:21.426 --> 00:06:24.395
The airport does not endorse solicitors.

44
00:06:24.429 --> 00:06:26.397
<i>Tre bien, Clear. C'est correct.</i>

45
00:06:26.431 --> 00:06:30.390
<i>Alors, suivez-moi.
On va en France.</i>

46
00:06:33.438 --> 00:06:35.406
Death is not the end.

47
00:06:37.442 --> 00:06:40.411
It will be for you
if you harass my students.

48
00:06:40.445 --> 00:06:41.412
<i>Hare Rama.</i>

49
00:06:41.446 --> 00:06:43.414
<i>Fuck off.</i>

50
00:06:48.453 --> 00:06:52.423
I have to ask you
a few questions this evening...

52
00:06:53.457 --> 00:06:58.418
Have your belongings remained
in your possession the entire time?

53
00:07:00.465 --> 00:07:03.366
- Mr. Browning?
- Oh, yeah.

54
00:07:04.402 --> 00:07:09.362
Have you received any packages
from persons unknown to you?

55
00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:24.388
- Same as your birthday.
- What?

56
00:07:24.422 --> 00:07:27.391
September 25, 925.

57
00:07:27.425 --> 00:07:32.385
Your birthday's the same
as your departure time.

58
00:07:46.444 --> 00:07:49.413
Hey. Hey, George, Dad said "both",
both of us, all right?

59
00:07:49.447 --> 00:07:51.415
Man, come on, just give me some cash.

60
00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:53.417
Hey, knock it off!

63
00:07:55.453 --> 00:07:57.421
You asshole.

64
00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:10.367
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

65
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:42.399
Alex... let's go take a shit.

66
00:08:42.433 --> 00:08:44.401
Dude, why don't you go take
a shit by yourself?

67
00:08:44.435 --> 00:08:45.402
No, no, no, dude.

68
00:08:45.436 --> 00:08:47.404
Listen, okay?
Listen, take some knowledge.

69
00:08:47.438 --> 00:08:49.406
We're about to board a 7-hour flight.

70
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.408
The toilets in coach are barely
ventilated closets,

71
00:08:51.442 --> 00:08:54.411
if that, now, let's say halfway
through the flight, right?

72
00:08:54.445 --> 00:08:56.413
Your body wants that airplane food out.

73
00:08:56.447 --> 00:08:59.416
You gotta go torque a wicked cable,
and then right after you...

74
00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:03.352
like directly after you,
walks in Christa or Blake.

75
00:09:04.388 --> 00:09:07.857
Do you want them to associate you
with that watery sting in their eye,

76
00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:11.350
that reflexive gag
at the back of their throat?

77
00:09:31.415 --> 00:09:33.383
Died in a plane crash.

78
00:09:33.417 --> 00:09:35.385
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.</i>

79
00:09:35.419 --> 00:09:38.178
<i>At this time we would like to
begin preboarding of</i>

80
00:09:38.223 --> 00:09:43.382
<i>Vole Air flight 180
to Paris through gate 46.</i>

81
00:09:53.437 --> 00:09:57.396
Anyone seen Billy Hitchcock!?
How did we lose him?

82
00:09:57.441 --> 00:09:58.408
<i>Vingt-et-un,</i>

83
00:09:58.442 --> 00:10:00.410
<i>vingt-deux, vingt-trois...</i>

84
00:10:04.448 --> 00:10:08.407
<i>Vingt-quatre... vingt-cinq.</i>

85
00:10:32.476 --> 00:10:33.443
Go.

87
00:10:35.479 --> 00:10:37.447
That hurt.

88
00:10:52.496 --> 00:10:54.464
My little baby.

89
00:10:54.498 --> 00:10:56.466
That's a good sign.
The younger the better,

90
00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:00.459
it'd be a fucked-up God
to take down this plane.

91
00:11:04.442 --> 00:11:06.410
A really fucked-up God.

92
00:11:09.447 --> 00:11:10.414
- Hi.
- Hey, Tod.

93
00:11:10.448 --> 00:11:12.416
How you doin'?

94
00:11:28.466 --> 00:11:31.435
Can you... switch seats with Christa?

95
00:11:31.469 --> 00:11:35.428
Ah, God. You know, I would,
but I got a bladder thing.

96
00:11:35.473 --> 00:11:38.442
It's a urinary tract infection.

97
00:11:39.477 --> 00:11:41.445
Let's go ask Alex.

98
00:11:48.486 --> 00:11:49.453
Alex?

99
00:11:49.487 --> 00:11:52.456
Could you trade seats with Blake,
so she and I could sit together?

100
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:57.450
She asked Tod, but he said he had
some sort of medical thing.

101
00:11:57.495 --> 00:12:01.398
- Please?
- Yeah.

102
00:12:04.435 --> 00:12:06.403
You're so sweet.
Thanks, Alex.

103
00:12:06.437 --> 00:12:08.405
Thank you, Alex.

104
00:12:08.439 --> 00:12:13.399
You're welcome.
You're welcome.

105
00:12:15.446 --> 00:12:19.405
Did you... believe we're gonna
titty-fuck 'em over Greenland?

106
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:25.411
You know, because of you, I gotta
sit here and watch fucking Stuart Little.

107
00:12:26.457 --> 00:12:29.426
Thank you.
Thanks, man, that's great.

108
00:12:31.462 --> 00:12:34.431
Sorry I'm late.
That's my seat right there.

109
00:12:34.465 --> 00:12:35.432
Thanks.

110
00:12:36.467 --> 00:12:37.434
Hello?

111
00:12:37.468 --> 00:12:39.436
I'm going away.

112
00:13:31.455 --> 00:13:34.424
<i>Attention. Notre voyage</i>

113
00:13:34.458 --> 00:13:36.426

114
00:13:44.468 --> 00:13:46.436
All right.

115
00:13:52.476 --> 00:13:54.444
Whatever.

116
00:14:06.423 --> 00:14:08.391
<i>It's okay.</i>

117
00:14:12.429 --> 00:14:14.397
It's fine.

118
00:14:22.439 --> 00:14:24.407
It's okay, honey. I...

119
00:14:50.467 --> 00:14:52.435
Everybody!
<i>les estudiants!</i>

121
00:15:44.255 --> 00:15:45.422
Alex?

122
00:15:45.456 --> 00:15:48.425
Could you trade seats with Blake,
so she and I could sit together?

123
00:15:48.459 --> 00:15:51.428
She asked Tod, but he said he had
some sort of medical thing.

124
00:15:51.462 --> 00:15:53.430
Please?

125
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:01.438
What's up, dude?

126
00:16:05.109 --> 00:16:07.878
- Is there a problem, sir?
- What's your fuckin' problem?

127
00:16:07.912 --> 00:16:09.079
<i>Alex, qu'est-ce que c'est?</i>

128
00:16:09.113 --> 00:16:11.381
<i>Qu'est-ce que c'est!?</i>
The fuckin' plane's gonna explode!

129
00:16:11.415 --> 00:16:13.383
- Shut up, Browning.
- You're so not funny.

130
00:16:13.417 --> 00:16:16.386
- If this is your idea of a joke...
- It's not a joke! It's not a joke!

131
00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.388
Alex, take it easy.

132
00:16:18.422 --> 00:16:20.390
- The plane is going down!
- Don't worry.

133
00:16:20.424 --> 00:16:22.392
We'll remove you from
this aircraft, if this continues.

134
00:16:22.426 --> 00:16:24.394
- I'll fucking remove myself!
- Excuse me.

135
00:16:24.428 --> 00:16:26.396
Get off him!

136
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.399
That's my seat right there.

137
00:16:29.433 --> 00:16:31.401
Everybody in the aisle, off the plane.

138
00:16:31.435 --> 00:16:34.404
Everybody, just stay where you are
and just sit tight!

139
00:16:34.438 --> 00:16:37.407
Fuckin' plane is going down...

140
00:16:37.441 --> 00:16:41.400
- Go check him out, see how he's doin'.
- Okay.

141
00:16:49.453 --> 00:16:51.421
I didn't do anything,
I got my plane ticket right here!

142
00:16:51.955 --> 00:16:55.425
Let go! Jerk!
Hey!

144
00:16:55.459 --> 00:16:56.426
You got this?

145
00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.428
No one gets back on board.

146
00:16:58.462 --> 00:17:00.430
That's my call.

147
00:17:00.464 --> 00:17:03.365
Wait, please. I've got 40
students going to Paris. Please.

148
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.368
Look, you must understand my position.

149
00:17:05.402 --> 00:17:07.370
I understand your position
and I apologize for Alex.

150
00:17:07.404 --> 00:17:09.372
But one of us needs to be on that plane.

151
00:17:09.406 --> 00:17:12.375
I cannot let all those students
go to Paris for 10 days without...

152
00:17:12.409 --> 00:17:16.368
- Carter, no!
- Sit the fuck down, Carter!

153
00:17:16.413 --> 00:17:19.382
One of you can go on the flight,
and that's it.

155
00:17:19.416 --> 00:17:20.383
Larry.

156
00:17:22.419 --> 00:17:25.388
Look, the airline's not taking this
very well, they'll let one of us back on.

157
00:17:25.422 --> 00:17:28.391
The rest of us can take an 11:10 flight,
it gets in 3 hours later

158
00:17:28.425 --> 00:17:30.393
- at de Gaulle...
- I'll stay.

159
00:17:30.427 --> 00:17:34.386
No, you know the whole French thing,
get on the plane, it's fine. It's fine.

160
00:17:34.431 --> 00:17:39.391
Hi, Mr. Murnau. I was in the bathroom
and the lock, it was stuck, and...

161
00:17:39.436 --> 00:17:42.405
Wait, I didn't fight with anyone!

162
00:17:42.439 --> 00:17:43.406
Damn!

163
00:17:44.441 --> 00:17:45.408
Thanks.

164
00:17:50.948 --> 00:17:54.908
Just... called your parents,
they're on their way.

165
00:18:03.394 --> 00:18:06.363
Alex, talk to me, tell me what happened.

166
00:18:06.397 --> 00:18:13.058
I saw it. Like, I don't know. I saw it
on the runway, I saw it take off,

167
00:18:13.105 --> 00:18:16.373
I saw, out my window,
I saw the ground and...

168
00:18:16.407 --> 00:18:19.377
- No, Carter.
- The cabin, it starts to shake, right?

170
00:18:19.411 --> 00:18:23.380
And the left side blows up and
then the whole plane just explodes.

171
00:18:23.414 --> 00:18:26.082
And it was so real, just like
how everything happens, you know?

172
00:18:26.116 --> 00:18:27.784
You been on a lot of planes that blew up?

173
00:18:27.818 --> 00:18:30.387
You must've fallen asleep.

174
00:18:30.421 --> 00:18:34.380
We get thrown off the plane,
we blow, what? A half a day in Paris?

175
00:18:34.425 --> 00:18:37.394
All because Browning has
a bad fuckin' dream?

176
00:18:37.428 --> 00:18:38.395
"But wait,

177
00:18:38.429 --> 00:18:40.397
but the plane, it's gonna blow up!
It's gonna blow up!"

178
00:18:40.431 --> 00:18:42.399
- Hey, fuck you, Horton.
- Tod.

179
00:18:42.433 --> 00:18:45.402
The only trip you're taking
is to the fuckin' hospital!

181
00:18:45.436 --> 00:18:46.403
Get off him!

182
00:18:46.437 --> 00:18:49.406
Hey, Alex, stop it!

184
00:18:52.443 --> 00:18:55.412
There they go.
Here we stay.

185
00:18:57.448 --> 00:18:59.116
You're paying for my trip, Browning.

186
00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.418
- Wish you were on that plane!
- You fuckin' prick!

187
00:19:01.452 --> 00:19:03.352
Oh, shit!

188
00:20:05.449 --> 00:20:09.408
You're lookin' at me as if I caused this.

189
00:20:11.455 --> 00:20:13.423
I didn't cause this.

190
00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:18.428
Are there any survivors?

191
00:20:24.468 --> 00:20:26.436
How should I know?

192
00:20:29.473 --> 00:20:34.433
- What? You think I'm some sort of...
- He's not a witch.

193
00:20:38.482 --> 00:20:42.441
Hello, I'm Howard Seigel.
National Transportation and Safety Board.

194
00:20:42.486 --> 00:20:45.455
We've contacted all your families,
they are on the way.

195
00:20:45.489 --> 00:20:47.457
Is there anyone here who...

196
00:20:47.491 --> 00:20:50.460
feels they might need
a little medical attention

197
00:20:50.494 --> 00:20:52.462
or... spiritual counseling at this time?

198
00:20:52.496 --> 00:20:56.455
What's going on?
Are there any survivors?

199
00:20:57.501 --> 00:21:00.470
Well, the cause for the explosion
is still undetermined.

200
00:21:00.504 --> 00:21:03.405
The Nassau County authorities
are on the scene.

201
00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.408
Naval search and rescue on route.

202
00:21:05.442 --> 00:21:07.410
- We...
- Excuse me.

203
00:21:07.444 --> 00:21:11.403
I'm Agent Weine, this is Agent Schreck.
We're with the FBI.

204
00:21:11.448 --> 00:21:14.417
Now I understand how y'all
must be feelin' right now...

205
00:21:14.451 --> 00:21:17.420
it's gonna be difficult, but we're
gonna need to ask you a couple of

206
00:21:17.454 --> 00:21:20.423
questions regarding today's event
while they're still fresh in your mind.

207
00:21:20.457 --> 00:21:23.426
I'm sure this will prove invaluable
to our rescue attempts and

208
00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:27.419
any potential criminal investigation.

209
00:21:29.466 --> 00:21:31.434
You said, "Listen to me,

210
00:21:31.468 --> 00:21:36.428
this plane will explode on take off.".
How did you know that?

211
00:21:36.473 --> 00:21:38.441
I got this feeling.

212
00:21:39.476 --> 00:21:41.444
This weird feeling.

213
00:21:41.478 --> 00:21:44.447
Did you take any sedatives
before boarding the plane, or onboard,

214
00:21:44.481 --> 00:21:47.450
did you take any sleeping pills, 
any narcotics, any hallucinogens?

215
00:21:47.484 --> 00:21:50.453
- Alex, do you take any drugs?
- No.

216
00:21:51.488 --> 00:21:53.456
I saw it.

217
00:21:55.492 --> 00:21:59.451
I saw it happen.
I saw the plane explode.

218
00:21:59.496 --> 00:22:01.464
Did the weird feelings have
anything to do with your saying

219
00:22:01.498 --> 00:22:07.403
that you wished that Carter was
on the plane... just before it exploded?

220
00:22:07.437 --> 00:22:10.406
- No.
- Then why'd you say it?

221
00:22:11.441 --> 00:22:13.409
'Cause I didn't think it was gonna happen.

222
00:22:13.443 --> 00:22:19.404
If that's the case, Alex.
Then why did you really get off the plane?

223
00:22:21.451 --> 00:22:27.412
My brother, George, he told me to go
and keep an eye on Alex.

224
00:22:28.458 --> 00:22:31.427
And so he stayed and...

225
00:22:37.467 --> 00:22:40.436
he told me to get off the plane.

226
00:22:41.471 --> 00:22:44.440
Larry Murnau said
I should get back on, but I...

227
00:22:44.474 --> 00:22:49.434
I told him that he should go.

228
00:22:49.479 --> 00:22:52.448
I sent him back on the plane.

229
00:22:54.484 --> 00:22:58.443
All right... nobody forced
you off the plane.

230
00:22:58.488 --> 00:23:02.390
You said you weren't friends
with those that were.

231
00:23:02.426 --> 00:23:06.385
So Clear, why did you get off the plane?

232
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:09.399
Because I saw and I heard Alex.

233
00:23:13.437 --> 00:23:15.405
I believed him.

234
00:23:37.962 --> 00:23:39.930
There he is.

235
00:24:06.423 --> 00:24:08.391
Thank you for the ride.

236
00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.388
<i>You are looking at the 1st piece of debris</i>

237
00:25:12.422 --> 00:25:15.391
<i>to wash ashore from Vole Air flight 180</i>

238
00:25:15.425 --> 00:25:18.694
<i>which erupted shortly
after a 9:25 pm takeoff</i>

239
00:25:18.728 --> 00:25:21.397
<i>from John F. Kennedy Airport in New York.</i>

240
00:25:21.431 --> 00:25:23.399
<i>There are no known survivors.</i>

241
00:25:23.433 --> 00:25:26.402
<i>However, Coast Guard and
Naval search and rescue efforts</i>

242
00:25:26.436 --> 00:25:31.396
<i>are continuing at this moment, even as
jet fuel burns on the ocean's surface.</i>

243
00:25:31.441 --> 00:25:35.400
<i>Authorities are pessimistic about
the possibility of finding anyone alive</i>

244
00:25:35.445 --> 00:25:37.413
<i>from the ill-fated flight.</i>

245
00:25:37.447 --> 00:25:41.406
<i>All 287 passengers are feared dead.</i>

246
00:25:41.451 --> 00:25:45.410
<i>Amongst the travelers, a class of 40
students and 4 teachers</i>

247
00:25:45.455 --> 00:25:48.424
<i>from Mount Abraham High School
in southeast New York,</i>

248
00:25:48.458 --> 00:25:50.426
<i>on route to Paris on a field trip.</i>

249
00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.419
<i>There're reports that several students
were removed from the aircraft</i>

250
00:25:54.464 --> 00:25:56.432
<i>moments before departure.</i>

251
00:25:56.466 --> 00:26:00.425
<i>However, investigators remain guarded
about the specifics of this incident.</i>

252
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:04.372
<i>Authorities from the National
Transportation and Safety Board and</i>

253
00:26:04.407 --> 00:26:09.367
<i>the FBI have arrived at JFK
to begin the initial investigation.</i>

255
00:26:09.412 --> 00:26:12.381
<i>Eyewitnesses at the airport,
as well as on Long Island</i>

256
00:26:12.415 --> 00:26:15.384
<i>report seeing the plane explode.</i>

257
00:26:15.418 --> 00:26:18.387
<i>No other aircraft were visibly
near flight 180.</i>

258
00:26:18.421 --> 00:26:22.380
<i>At JFK, air traffic controllers are
corroborating these eyewitness accounts.</i>

259
00:26:22.425 --> 00:26:24.393
<i>After the explosion,</i>

260
00:26:24.427 --> 00:26:28.386
<i>debris apparently rained into
the Atlantic Ocean for several miles.</i>

261
00:26:28.431 --> 00:26:32.390
<i>However, investigators are cautious
about verifying these accounts,</i>

262
00:26:32.435 --> 00:26:35.404
<i>believing they'll learn more...</i>

263
00:26:55.458 --> 00:27:02.364
39 days have passed since we lost
our 39 loved ones, friends and teachers.

264
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:07.359
As each day passes without
a determining cause for the accident,

265
00:27:07.404 --> 00:27:10.373
we ask ourselves, "Why?".

266
00:27:11.408 --> 00:27:14.377
Ecclesiastes tells us,

267
00:27:14.411 --> 00:27:17.380
"Man no more knows his own time

268
00:27:17.414 --> 00:27:20.383
than fish taken in the fatal net

269
00:27:20.417 --> 00:27:23.386
or birds trapped in the snare.

270
00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.389
Like these, the children of men caught,

271
00:27:26.423 --> 00:27:30.382
when the time falls suddenly upon them.".

272
00:27:30.427 --> 00:27:32.395
And so, before we can heal,

273
00:27:32.429 --> 00:27:37.389
before we can escape
the presence of death and time,

274
00:27:37.434 --> 00:27:40.403
we must mourn and celebrate theirs...

275
00:27:40.437 --> 00:27:42.405
with this memorial.

276
00:28:27.117 --> 00:28:29.385
Hope you don't think, Browning,
because my name ain't up

277
00:28:29.419 --> 00:28:32.388
on this wall, that I owe you anything.

278
00:28:32.422 --> 00:28:33.389
I don't.

279
00:28:33.423 --> 00:28:37.382
'Cause all I owe are these people,
to live my life to the fullest.

280
00:28:37.427 --> 00:28:40.396
Why don't you stay off the J.D.
then, Carter?

281
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.399
Listen, don't you ever fuckin'
tell me what to do, all right?

282
00:28:43.433 --> 00:28:46.402
- I control my life, not you!
- Carter!

283
00:28:48.438 --> 00:28:50.406
I'm never gonna die.

284
00:28:59.449 --> 00:29:03.351
- Hey, Alex. Hey.
- Hey.

285
00:29:03.386 --> 00:29:06.355
I took my driver's test
last week at the DMV.

286
00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:09.358
Got a 70. It's the lowest score
you can get, but I passed.

287
00:29:09.392 --> 00:29:11.360
The thing is when I was done
with the test,

288
00:29:11.394 --> 00:29:14.363
you know the guy that drives with you,
you know, during the test?

289
00:29:14.397 --> 00:29:17.366
Yeah, well, anyways, he goes...
"Young man,

291
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.369
you're gonna die at a very young age.".

292
00:29:20.403 --> 00:29:24.362
Yeah.
Is that true?

293
00:29:24.407 --> 00:29:28.366
Not now, not here, not ever, Billy.

294
00:29:30.413 --> 00:29:33.872
If I ask out Cynthia Paster,
will she say no?

295
00:29:33.917 --> 00:29:35.384
Fuck.

296
00:29:35.418 --> 00:29:36.385
Okay.

297
00:29:36.419 --> 00:29:38.387
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

298
00:29:45.428 --> 00:29:46.395
Miss Lewton.

299
00:29:46.429 --> 00:29:50.388
Don't talk to me,
you scare the hell out of me.

300
00:29:51.434 --> 00:29:53.402
I'm gonna go up.

301
00:30:00.443 --> 00:30:01.410
Hey.

302
00:30:02.445 --> 00:30:03.412
Hey.

303
00:30:05.448 --> 00:30:08.417
Listen, I don't want you to take
this the wrong way, man, I... 

304
00:30:08.451 --> 00:30:11.420
miss you, you know.

305
00:30:12.455 --> 00:30:17.415
Yeah, I miss you too. But my father,
you know, he doesn't understand.

306
00:30:17.961 --> 00:30:19.428
Yeah.

307
00:30:20.463 --> 00:30:24.422
Hey, look, when he gets over
this thing... you and me...

308
00:30:24.467 --> 00:30:28.426
we're gonna trip to the city, you know?
Catch the Yanks.

309
00:30:28.471 --> 00:30:31.440
Yeah...
Yeah, all right, we'll do that.

310
00:30:34.477 --> 00:30:36.445
"Could better go."

311
00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.448
This thing Miss Lewton showed me in class,

312
00:30:39.482 --> 00:30:44.442
they're gonna let me read it.
It says what I'm feeling.

313
00:30:45.488 --> 00:30:47.456
Take care, man.

314
00:30:56.499 --> 00:30:59.468
Because of you, I'm still alive.

315
00:31:02.438 --> 00:31:04.406
Thank you.

316
00:31:10.446 --> 00:31:15.406
We say that the hour of death
cannot be forecast.

317
00:31:15.451 --> 00:31:19.410
But... but when we say this,

318
00:31:19.455 --> 00:31:22.424
we imagine that the hour
is placed in an obscure...

319
00:31:22.458 --> 00:31:24.426
and distant future.

320
00:31:25.461 --> 00:31:28.430
Never occurs to us that
it has any connection

321
00:31:28.464 --> 00:31:31.433
with the day already begun...

322
00:31:31.467 --> 00:31:35.426
or that death could arrive
this same afternoon...

323
00:31:35.471 --> 00:31:39.430
<i>this afternoon which is so certain...</i>

324
00:31:39.475 --> 00:31:44.435
<i>and which has every hour...
filled in advance.</i>

325
00:37:28.424 --> 00:37:30.392
What happened?

326
00:37:31.427 --> 00:37:33.395
Where's Tod?

327
00:37:35.732 --> 00:37:37.399
Alex!

328
00:37:38.434 --> 00:37:40.402
Get outta here!

329
00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:57.419
- Didn't you see it?
- What happened?

330
00:37:57.453 --> 00:38:02.356
You caused Tod so much guilt
over George staying on the plane...

331
00:38:02.391 --> 00:38:05.360
- he took his own life.
- No.

332
00:38:08.397 --> 00:38:11.366
Look... he wouldn't do that.

333
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.369
He said to me we'd be friends
again after you got better.

334
00:38:14.403 --> 00:38:18.373
Why would he make plans with me
if he was thinking about killing himself?

336
00:38:18.407 --> 00:38:20.375
Mr. Waggner.

337
00:38:22.411 --> 00:38:24.379
Mr. Waggner!

338
00:38:24.413 --> 00:38:25.380
Easy.

339
00:38:26.415 --> 00:38:28.383
All right.

340
00:38:28.417 --> 00:38:30.385
Here we go.

341
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.368
Almost autumn.

342
00:39:20.403 --> 00:39:23.372
It's only the end of June.

343
00:39:23.406 --> 00:39:26.375
Yeah, but everything's
always in transition.

344
00:39:26.409 --> 00:39:28.377
If you focus even now,
just 1 week into summer,

345
00:39:28.411 --> 00:39:31.380
you can almost feel autumn coming.

346
00:39:31.414 --> 00:39:34.383
I like bein' able to see the future.

347
00:39:34.417 --> 00:39:38.376
Why were you at Tod's house last night?

348
00:39:39.422 --> 00:39:44.382
I've seen enough TV to know that
the FBI doesn't investigate teen suicide.

349
00:39:44.427 --> 00:39:46.395
They were there last night,
that means 1:

350
00:39:46.429 --> 00:39:48.397
They still don't have a clue
what caused the crash.

351
00:39:48.431 --> 00:39:50.399
2: They haven't ruled out anything,

352
00:39:50.433 --> 00:39:53.402
and the fact that 7 people got off
the plane is probably weird enough.

353
00:39:53.436 --> 00:39:57.395
Not to mention that one of
those people had a vision or whatever,

354
00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.409
of the plane exploding minutes
before it actually did explode,

355
00:40:00.443 --> 00:40:01.410
is highly suspicious.

356
00:40:01.444 --> 00:40:07.405
And it doesn't help that the visionary's
friend just committed suicide.

357
00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:10.419
Why were you there last night?

358
00:40:14.457 --> 00:40:17.426
Do you know what this is?

359
00:40:19.462 --> 00:40:21.430
This is a...

360
00:40:23.466 --> 00:40:26.435
Who's this spring-head guy?

361
00:40:26.469 --> 00:40:28.437
It's you.

362
00:40:28.471 --> 00:40:31.440
Not a likeness.

363
00:40:31.474 --> 00:40:35.433
It's how you make me feel, Alex.

364
00:40:36.479 --> 00:40:38.447
I'm sorry.

365
00:40:38.481 --> 00:40:43.441
No, like you, this sculpture doesn't
even know what or why it is.

366
00:40:43.486 --> 00:40:48.446
It's reluctant to take form
and yet creating an absolute...

367
00:40:48.491 --> 00:40:51.460
but incomprehensible attraction.

368
00:40:53.496 --> 00:40:57.455
In 4 years of high school,
we haven't said one word to each other.

369
00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:00.469
At that moment, on the plane,
I felt what you felt.

370
00:41:00.503 --> 00:41:03.404
I didn't even know where those emotions
were coming from until you started

371
00:41:03.439 --> 00:41:09.900
freaking out... Okay,
I didn't see what you saw, I felt it.

372
00:41:10.446 --> 00:41:13.415
You can still feel it, can't you?

373
00:41:13.449 --> 00:41:17.408
Something from that day is still with you.

374
00:41:18.454 --> 00:41:25.915
I know because I can still feel you.
That's why I was there last night.

375
00:41:28.464 --> 00:41:32.423
You know, I've never dealt
with death before.

376
00:41:32.468 --> 00:41:35.437
This could all be in our head.

377
00:41:35.471 --> 00:41:40.431
- It just feels like it's all around us.
- It?

378
00:41:42.478 --> 00:41:45.447
What if Tod was just the first...

379
00:41:45.481 --> 00:41:47.449
of us?

380
00:41:47.483 --> 00:41:50.452
Is that something that you're feeling?

381
00:41:51.487 --> 00:41:54.456
I don't know. You know,
I just wish I could see him again.

382
00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:58.449
One last time.
So maybe I would know.

383
00:41:59.495 --> 00:42:02.396
Then let's go see him.

384
00:42:31.961 --> 00:42:33.428
Easy.

385
00:42:35.464 --> 00:42:37.432
Gives me a rush.

386
00:42:39.468 --> 00:42:41.436
This place?

387
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:44.439
Doing something I'm not supposed to do.

388
00:42:47.476 --> 00:42:49.444
Come on.

389
00:42:53.482 --> 00:42:55.450
<i>Hurry up.</i>

390
00:43:09.431 --> 00:43:11.399
Is that him?

391
00:43:11.433 --> 00:43:16.393
I think. Why did they make him up
like Michael Jackson?

392
00:43:16.438 --> 00:43:18.406
Yeah, that's him.

393
00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:23.400
Whatever it was, that made him,
Tod is definitely gone.

394
00:43:24.747 --> 00:43:27.415
Holy Christ!

395
00:43:29.451 --> 00:43:33.410
Please.
You'll wake the dead.

396
00:43:44.667 --> 00:43:47.435
- Why did his hand do that?
- Chemicals...

397
00:43:47.469 --> 00:43:51.428
in the vascular,
flush create cadaveric spasms.

398
00:43:51.473 --> 00:43:52.440
Look,

399
00:43:53.475 --> 00:43:57.434
- I was his friend, and...
- I know who you are.

400
00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.448
What are all those tiny marks?

401
00:44:00.482 --> 00:44:04.384
Cuticle lacerations
from pulling at the wire.

402
00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:06.388
Pulling at the wire?

403
00:44:06.422 --> 00:44:09.391
He was pulling at the wire,
he wasn't trying to kill himself.

404
00:44:09.425 --> 00:44:13.384
- It was an accident.
- In death... there are no accidents,

405
00:44:13.429 --> 00:44:16.398
no coincidences, no mishaps,

406
00:44:16.432 --> 00:44:18.400
and no escapes.

407
00:44:20.436 --> 00:44:23.405
What you have to realize
is that we're all just...

408
00:44:23.439 --> 00:44:26.408
a mouse that a cat has by the tail.

409
00:44:26.442 --> 00:44:31.402
Every single move we make,
from the mundane to the monumental,

410
00:44:31.447 --> 00:44:34.416
the red light that we stop at or run,

411
00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:37.419
the people we have sex with,
or won't with us,

412
00:44:37.453 --> 00:44:40.422
the airplanes that
we ride or... walk out of...

413
00:44:40.456 --> 00:44:45.416
It's all part of death's sadistic design,
leading to the grave.

414
00:44:46.462 --> 00:44:48.430
Design...

415
00:44:49.465 --> 00:44:51.433
Does that mean if...

416
00:44:51.467 --> 00:44:54.436
if you figure out the design,
you can cheat death?

417
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:55.437
Alex...

418
00:44:56.472 --> 00:45:00.431
you've already done that
by walking off the plane.

419
00:45:00.476 --> 00:45:03.377
Your friend's departure shows that death

420
00:45:03.412 --> 00:45:06.381
has a new design, for all of you.

421
00:45:07.416 --> 00:45:09.384
Now you have to figure out

422
00:45:09.418 --> 00:45:13.377
how and when it's coming back at you.

423
00:45:14.423 --> 00:45:16.391
Play your hunch, Alex...

424
00:45:16.425 --> 00:45:19.394
if you think you can get away with it.

425
00:45:19.428 --> 00:45:24.388
But remember,
the risk of cheating the plan...

426
00:45:24.433 --> 00:45:27.402
of disrespecting the design...

427
00:45:27.436 --> 00:45:32.396
could incite a fury that could
terrorize even the Grim Reaper.

428
00:45:33.442 --> 00:45:38.402
And you don't even wanna
fuck with that Mack Daddy.

429
00:45:42.451 --> 00:45:44.419
Okay, then, well...

430
00:45:44.453 --> 00:45:47.422
Yeah, I'm sorry we broke in, and...

431
00:45:47.456 --> 00:45:50.425
No harm... no foul.

432
00:45:54.463 --> 00:45:56.431
I'll see you soon.

433
00:46:02.404 --> 00:46:05.373
The mortician said that
death has a design.

434
00:46:05.407 --> 00:46:06.374
Okay...

435
00:46:07.409 --> 00:46:09.377
I'm talkin' about omens.

436
00:46:09.411 --> 00:46:14.371
How do we know that just by sitting here,
by sipping this coffee... or

437
00:46:14.416 --> 00:46:18.375
breathin' the air, or even crossing the
intersection that we haven't started...

438
00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:21.389
in motion, the events that will
someday lead to our death

439
00:46:21.423 --> 00:46:25.382
40 years from now,
10 years from now, tomorrow.

440
00:46:25.427 --> 00:46:32.389
We don't, unless we open ourselves up
to the signs it's willing to show us.

442
00:46:35.437 --> 00:46:39.396
I don't understand.
Did you see Tod die?

443
00:46:39.441 --> 00:46:41.409
Did it happen again?

444
00:46:41.443 --> 00:46:43.411
- Like on the plane?
- No.

445
00:46:43.445 --> 00:46:47.404
No, it didn't, but I mean,
it might as well have.

446
00:46:47.449 --> 00:46:49.417
This is a message from something, Clear.

447
00:46:49.451 --> 00:46:52.420
Or someone hinting at a design.

448
00:46:52.454 --> 00:46:56.413
Total bullshit. I mean, you can find
death omens anywhere you want to.

449
00:46:56.458 --> 00:47:00.417
Coffee... starts with a "C"
and ends with an "E".

450
00:47:00.462 --> 00:47:04.364
So does the word "choke". So what?
We're gonna choke to death?

451
00:47:04.399 --> 00:47:06.367
I wanna hear you.

452
00:47:06.401 --> 00:47:09.370
We'll go nuts if you start with this shit.

453
00:47:09.404 --> 00:47:13.363
Mortician said that
death has a design... right?

454
00:47:13.408 --> 00:47:16.377
What if you, me, Tod, Carter,

455
00:47:16.411 --> 00:47:19.380
Terry, Billy, Mrs. Lewton
messed up that design?

456
00:47:19.414 --> 00:47:24.374
For whatever reason, I saw
death's plan... then we cheated it.

457
00:47:24.419 --> 00:47:26.387
But what if it was our time?

458
00:47:26.421 --> 00:47:29.390
What if we were not meant
to get off that plane?

459
00:47:29.424 --> 00:47:32.393
What if it still is our time?

460
00:47:32.427 --> 00:47:35.396
If it is, then it's not finished.

461
00:47:36.431 --> 00:47:39.400
And we will die... now, not later.

462
00:47:40.435 --> 00:47:41.902
Unless...

463
00:47:42.938 --> 00:47:46.897
unless we find the patterns
and cheat it again.

464
00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:58.419
After hearing you, I do believe...

465
00:47:59.454 --> 00:48:01.422
that Tod killed himself.

466
00:48:34.423 --> 00:48:36.391
Hey, baby, come on, not now.

467
00:48:37.426 --> 00:48:38.393
Carter.

468
00:48:39.428 --> 00:48:41.396
Looks like we have
a bit of a reunion here.

469
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:42.397
Let it go.

470
00:48:42.431 --> 00:48:45.400
- When are you... moving?
- A couple weeks.

471
00:48:45.434 --> 00:48:47.402
- That's too bad.
- Carter, you dick!

472
00:48:47.436 --> 00:48:49.404
- Losin' our favorite teacher.
- Baby, come on.

473
00:48:49.438 --> 00:48:51.406
Look, guys, there's something
I need to tell you, okay?

474
00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:54.409
- Alex.
- And lived here your whole life.

476
00:48:54.443 --> 00:48:56.411
- And now she's gotta move...
- Would you listen to...

477
00:48:56.445 --> 00:48:58.413
- all because of Browning!
- Enough!

478
00:48:58.447 --> 00:49:02.349
Both of you.
They died and we lived.

479
00:49:02.384 --> 00:49:04.352
Get over it.

480
00:49:04.386 --> 00:49:10.358
I'll not let this plane crash be the
most important thing in my life! God!

482
00:49:10.392 --> 00:49:12.360
I'm moving on, Carter.

483
00:49:12.394 --> 00:49:15.363
And if you wanna waste your life

484
00:49:15.397 --> 00:49:18.366
beating the shit out of Alex
every time you see him...

485
00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:21.369
then you can just drop fuckin' dead.

490
00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:49.397
<i>Hello?</i>

491
00:49:49.431 --> 00:49:51.399
Is Alex there?

492
00:49:51.433 --> 00:49:54.402
<i>Oh, hi, Clear.
Yeah, just a minute.</i>

493
00:49:54.436 --> 00:49:58.395
It's Clear, again.
You wanna talk to her?

494
00:50:01.443 --> 00:50:05.402
<i>Clear, he's in the shower.
Can I get him to call you back?</i>

495
00:50:05.447 --> 00:50:07.415
Sure... Bye.

496
00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:12.409
She's concerned about you.
I'm concerned about you.

497
00:50:12.454 --> 00:50:16.413
Why won't you talk to her?
Or me?

498
00:50:19.461 --> 00:50:22.430
Dad, you and Mom have both
been a big help.

499
00:50:22.464 --> 00:50:26.423
But there's something I need to
understand before I can talk...

500
00:50:26.468 --> 00:50:28.436
to anyone.

501
00:50:29.471 --> 00:50:31.439
<i>The National Transportation Safety Board

502
00:50:31.473 --> 00:50:35.432
<i>has a new theory tonight
on the possible cause of the explosion</i>

503
00:50:35.477 --> 00:50:39.436
<i>of Vole Air flight 180. Officials
believe deterioration of silicone</i>

504
00:50:39.481 --> 00:50:42.450
<i>insulation on an electrical connector
to the scavenger pump...</i>

505
00:50:42.484 --> 00:50:45.453
<i>may have leaked combustible fluids.
A spark in the fuel</i>

506
00:50:45.487 --> 00:50:47.455
- <i>switch beneath the coach cabin in</i>
- That's Tod's seat.

507
00:50:47.489 --> 00:50:51.448
<i>the fuselage may have ignited the
fuel line and proceeded to the fuel pump</i>

508
00:50:51.493 --> 00:50:56.453
<i>which would have set off the
catastrophic explosion.</i>

509
00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:28.429
Path of the explosion.

510
00:51:28.463 --> 00:51:30.431
Okay, the first was Tod.

511
00:51:30.465 --> 00:51:32.433
Then it was Terry.

512
00:51:32.467 --> 00:51:35.436
They're dying in the order
they would have died.

513
00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:37.438
That's death's design.

514
00:51:37.472 --> 00:51:39.440
Miss Lewton's next.

515
00:51:41.476 --> 00:51:46.436
<i>And whenever I can fall asleep
I just... I see Terry Chaney.</i>

516
00:51:46.481 --> 00:51:48.449
And in the day, out of nowhere,

517
00:51:48.483 --> 00:51:52.442
I hear the sound of my own voice
in my head, saying to Larry Murnau,

518
00:51:52.487 --> 00:51:56.446
"No, you know the whole French
thing, get on the plan.".

519
00:51:56.491 --> 00:51:59.460
Everything reminds me of that day.

520
00:52:01.496 --> 00:52:06.399
Right. Yeah, I'm hoping a change
will help. It's just that...

521
00:52:07.436 --> 00:52:10.405
I've... I've lived here my whole life,

522
00:52:10.439 --> 00:52:13.402
you know? And everywhere
I look are great memories.

523
00:52:13.442 --> 00:52:19.402
And now, I see is Larry and
those... those kids, you know?

525
00:52:20.449 --> 00:52:26.410
Just... lookin' at my own front yard
makes me feel nothing but fear.

526
00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:35.419
Laura, I'm gonna have to
call you back. Right.

527
00:52:35.464 --> 00:52:37.432
Oh, fuck.

528
00:52:44.473 --> 00:52:48.432
Hi, this is Valerie Lewton,
I need Agent Schreck.

529
00:53:13.435 --> 00:53:15.403
What are you doin' here?

530
00:53:16.438 --> 00:53:18.406
I was just...

531
00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:21.409
I was checkin' the air in the tire
to make sure it's safe.

532
00:53:21.443 --> 00:53:23.411
Get in the car.

533
00:53:35.457 --> 00:53:37.425
Put on your seat belt.

534
00:53:59.481 --> 00:54:01.449
I believe that...

535
00:54:03.418 --> 00:54:06.387
That Miss Lewton is next.

536
00:54:06.421 --> 00:54:08.389
- Next?
- Yes.

537
00:54:09.424 --> 00:54:11.392
Yeah, next, because...

538
00:54:11.426 --> 00:54:14.395
there's this pattern... that's occurring.

539
00:54:14.429 --> 00:54:19.389
Oh, right, a pattern, yeah.
You noticed that too.

540
00:54:34.449 --> 00:54:36.417
Mom's favorite.

541
00:54:58.473 --> 00:55:00.441
So, what about this pattern, Alex?

542
00:55:00.475 --> 00:55:03.376
Did you see it in another one
of your visions?

543
00:55:03.411 --> 00:55:06.380
Did you catch it in some TV static?

544
00:55:07.415 --> 00:55:11.374
You know, I never asked for
what happened on the plane.

545
00:55:11.419 --> 00:55:14.388
And you guys are gonna sit there
in your little chairs and make fun of me.

546
00:55:14.422 --> 00:55:16.390
Whatever, fine.

547
00:55:16.424 --> 00:55:20.383
But I saved 6 lives on that plane.
6 lives and

548
00:55:20.428 --> 00:55:23.397
everybody in my entire school
thinks I'm a freak.

549
00:55:23.431 --> 00:55:27.390
And I'm not... suffering from
post-traumatic stress,

550
00:55:27.435 --> 00:55:30.404
I don't have a narcissistic deity complex.

551
00:55:30.438 --> 00:55:34.897
I'm not goin' Dahmer on you guys.
This just is.

552
00:55:36.444 --> 00:55:38.412
There is a pattern for us all.

553
00:55:38.446 --> 00:55:41.415
There's a pattern for you.
There is a pattern for you,

554
00:55:41.449 --> 00:55:44.418
there's a design for everyone,
and I don't know how yet...

555
00:55:44.452 --> 00:55:47.421
but I'm gonna break this one.

556
00:57:06.401 --> 00:57:09.370
Alex you came to our attention
at first because you were under

557
00:57:09.404 --> 00:57:11.372
suspicion in this plane explosion.

558
00:57:11.406 --> 00:57:16.366
Now... I know you didn't
blow up the plane.

559
00:57:16.411 --> 00:57:18.880
And we were ready to move on...

560
00:57:18.914 --> 00:57:21.382
but then the other survivors
started to die.

561
00:57:21.416 --> 00:57:23.384
First, your friend, Tod.

562
00:57:23.418 --> 00:57:25.386
Then Terry Chaney, while you were
there, while you were at the scene,

563
00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:28.389
and now, tonight, we pick you up
at Val Lewton's house.

564
00:57:28.423 --> 00:57:30.391
Alex, nobody has control
over life and death

565
00:57:30.425 --> 00:57:34.384
unless they are taking lives
and causing death.

566
00:57:34.429 --> 00:57:38.388
Now, can you promise me that
no one else is gonna die?

567
00:57:38.433 --> 00:57:44.394
No, I can't. As long as I'm in here,
it's out of my control, I'm sorry.

568
00:57:49.444 --> 00:57:53.403
Okay.
Go ahead, get outta here.

569
00:57:54.449 --> 00:57:56.417
Thank you.

570
00:58:04.392 --> 00:58:06.360
That kid gives me the creeps.

571
00:58:06.394 --> 00:58:08.362
What are we gonna do?
We got nothin' to hold him on.

572
00:58:08.396 --> 00:58:10.364
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

573
00:58:10.398 --> 00:58:16.359
There were a couple of moments there...
where I almost believed him.

574
00:58:17.405 --> 00:58:20.374
Can I tell you somethin'?
Don't take this the wrong way...

575
00:58:20.408 --> 00:58:23.377
but sometimes, you give me the creeps.

576
00:58:40.428 --> 00:58:43.397
You've got to stop this,
stop this, it's a stupid mug.

577
00:58:43.431 --> 00:58:48.391
You're outta here, pretty soon
you'll be gone... You'll be gone.

578
01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.468
Miss Lewton!

579
01:01:09.444 --> 01:01:11.412
Miss Lewton.

580
01:01:13.448 --> 01:01:15.416
Okay.
All right.

581
01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:19.409
Just... just stay still, okay?

582
01:01:26.461 --> 01:01:29.430
Oh, God, Miss Lewton.

583
01:01:43.478 --> 01:01:45.446
Hey, Alex.

584
01:02:05.433 --> 01:02:06.400
Dude.

585
01:02:09.437 --> 01:02:13.396
I don't know where he is.
He's not talking to me.

586
01:02:13.441 --> 01:02:16.410
- Why?
- Because I didn't believe him.

587
01:02:16.444 --> 01:02:18.412
If he does contact you,

588
01:02:18.446 --> 01:02:22.405
I think that it would be in the best
interest of your safety if you called us.

589
01:02:22.450 --> 01:02:24.418
Here's my card.

590
01:02:24.452 --> 01:02:26.420
Toll-free number.

591
01:02:30.458 --> 01:02:32.426
Interesting work.

592
01:02:43.471 --> 01:02:45.439
Carter, you dick!

593
01:03:01.489 --> 01:03:03.389
What are you doing?

594
01:03:05.426 --> 01:03:08.395
Terry's name should be on this wall.

595
01:03:10.431 --> 01:03:12.399
Shit.

596
01:03:13.434 --> 01:03:16.403
Why'd you want us to
meet you here anyway, huh?

597
01:03:16.437 --> 01:03:19.406
'Cause they're watching me...
see if I go to Alex.

598
01:03:18.439 --> 01:03:19.406

599
01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:24.400
- That's why you're taking me.
- Why would I wanna see him?

600
01:03:24.445 --> 01:03:28.404
Because he knows which one of us is next.

601
01:03:40.461 --> 01:03:43.430
So, drive the speed limit, okay?

602
01:03:43.464 --> 01:03:46.433
Oh, and, don't pass on the right.

603
01:03:47.468 --> 01:03:51.427
Billy, wait a minute here,
I'm... I'm gettin' a vision.

604
01:03:51.472 --> 01:03:53.440
You're the next one, man.

605
01:03:53.474 --> 01:03:55.442
Hey, man, why'd you say that?

606
01:03:55.476 --> 01:04:00.436
Because if you say another word,
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

607
01:04:00.481 --> 01:04:01.448
Okay.

608
01:04:19.433 --> 01:04:21.401
He could be anywhere from here
to a mile down the road,

609
01:04:21.435 --> 01:04:23.403
so you guys drive down there
and start that way,

610
01:04:23.437 --> 01:04:27.407
and we'll meet back around the middle.
All right? It'll take half the time.

612
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:59.439
Do you think they're still up there?

613
01:05:00.474 --> 01:05:04.376
Somehow... flight 180,
are they still in flight?

614
01:05:04.412 --> 01:05:07.381
Somewhere... are they safe?

615
01:05:10.418 --> 01:05:14.377
When I was a kid... like 6 or 7,

616
01:05:14.422 --> 01:05:18.381
Used to worry so much
about my parents dying.

617
01:05:18.426 --> 01:05:21.395
Lying awake at night, just worrying.

618
01:05:21.429 --> 01:05:23.397
Most kids do, I guess.

619
01:05:23.431 --> 01:05:26.400
Most kids never have it happen.

620
01:05:30.438 --> 01:05:34.397
When I was 10, my dad went into
a 7-11 for cigarettes.

621
01:05:34.442 --> 01:05:37.411
I guess that he heard someone say,
"Don't turn around.",

622
01:05:37.445 --> 01:05:42.405
so on reflex or thinkin' it was
a friend joking, he did...

623
01:05:42.450 --> 01:05:45.419
and a guy blew his head off.

624
01:05:45.453 --> 01:05:48.422
Life became shit after that.

625
01:05:48.456 --> 01:05:51.425
My mom just couldn't deal anymore.

626
01:05:51.459 --> 01:05:55.418
She married this asshole who my mom
with my real dad would have crossed

627
01:05:55.463 --> 01:05:58.432
the street to avoid this guy.

628
01:05:58.466 --> 01:06:03.369
He didn't really want a kid,
so my mom didn't either anymore.

629
01:06:04.405 --> 01:06:08.364
If that was the design
for my father and my family...

630
01:06:08.409 --> 01:06:10.377
then fuck death!

631
01:06:12.413 --> 01:06:16.372
I have thought a lot about
that "somewhere", Alex.

632
01:06:16.417 --> 01:06:19.876
It exists, that place,
where my dad is still safe...

633
01:06:19.921 --> 01:06:24.380
where he had a full pack of cigarettes
that night and just kept driving...

634
01:06:24.425 --> 01:06:27.394
where me and my mom and
my dad are still together,

635
01:06:27.428 --> 01:06:30.397
and have no idea about this life here...

636
01:06:32.433 --> 01:06:35.402
where our friends are still in the sky...

637
01:06:35.436 --> 01:06:39.395
where everyone gets a 2nd chance.

638
01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:43.399
Alex, we can't give up.

639
01:06:47.448 --> 01:06:49.416
Look, I can't go home.
All right?

640
01:06:49.450 --> 01:06:51.418
Because after Miss Lewton,
they're gonna be looking for me.

641
01:06:51.452 --> 01:06:53.420
No, we're taking you to
my dad's cabin in the woods,

642
01:06:53.454 --> 01:06:55.422
it's only a couple miles from my house.

643
01:06:55.456 --> 01:06:58.425
All right, Browning,
you fuckin' warlock...

644
01:06:58.459 --> 01:07:01.428
did you hear about Miss Lewton or what?

645
01:07:01.462 --> 01:07:03.362
Why do you think I was hiding?

646
01:07:03.397 --> 01:07:06.366
Billy told the FBI he saw you
running from her house.

647
01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.368
I was running 'cause
they blame me for everything.

648
01:07:08.402 --> 01:07:10.370
They blame me for Tod,
they blame me for her,

649
01:07:10.404 --> 01:07:12.372
they blame me for
the fuckin' plane crash, Billy.

650
01:07:12.406 --> 01:07:15.875
Fire like, caramelized her blood, Alex.
Your shoe prints were in it.

651
01:07:15.909 --> 01:07:17.377
Your fingerprints were on the knives.

652
01:07:17.411 --> 01:07:19.379
I told you, Billy!
I told you they were not...

653
01:07:19.413 --> 01:07:21.381
I'm not talkin' about whether
not or you did it, all right?

654
01:07:21.415 --> 01:07:24.384
Or even if you knew she was dead...

655
01:07:24.418 --> 01:07:28.377
did you know she was gonna be next...
before she was?

656
01:07:33.427 --> 01:07:35.395
Yeah, I did.

657
01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:37.397
I knew.

658
01:07:40.434 --> 01:07:43.893
Out of us... who's next to see it?

659
01:07:43.938 --> 01:07:48.397
Please... tell me I'm gonna get to
see the Jets win a Super Bowl.

660
01:07:48.442 --> 01:07:50.410
It's me, right?

661
01:07:50.444 --> 01:07:53.413
That's why you're not sayin'.

662
01:07:53.447 --> 01:07:56.416
All right. I knew I should've felt up
Tammy in the pool that time.

663
01:07:56.450 --> 01:07:58.418
Hey, what are you whining about!?
He said I'm next!

664
01:07:58.452 --> 01:08:01.421
He didn't say anything.
Just drive.

665
01:08:01.455 --> 01:08:04.356
See, you have responsibility to tell me!

666
01:08:04.392 --> 01:08:09.352
You think it's gonna make it
easier to know, Carter?

667
01:08:09.397 --> 01:08:12.366
It's not, it's gonna make it
fuckin' harder.

668
01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.368
You get off havin' control over me?

669
01:08:14.402 --> 01:08:16.370
You let me decide how to deal with it.

670
01:08:16.404 --> 01:08:19.373
It doesn't matter who's next!

671
01:08:19.407 --> 01:08:23.366
'Cause we're all
on the same list, all of us!

672
01:08:24.412 --> 01:08:27.381
Fuck... really?

673
01:08:34.422 --> 01:08:37.391
All right, then why bother?
I mean, what's the fuckin' point, right?

674
01:08:37.425 --> 01:08:39.393
Me and Terry, we'll be back
together on the other side,

675
01:08:39.427 --> 01:08:41.395
so why wait any longer?

676
01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:45.399
Carter, what are you doin'?

677
01:08:46.434 --> 01:08:49.403
Carter, slow down.
Slow down, Carter!

678
01:08:49.437 --> 01:08:51.405
Fuck you!

679
01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:54.408
- Knock it off!
- Why!?

680
01:08:54.442 --> 01:08:56.110
May as well go out
on my own free will, right!?

681
01:08:56.144 --> 01:08:59.413
Not with us in the fucking car!

682
01:09:04.385 --> 01:09:06.353
Jesus, turn right!

683
01:09:07.388 --> 01:09:08.656
Carter, stop the car!

684
01:09:08.690 --> 01:09:10.858
What's with the fuckin' worry
if it ain't your time, huh?

685
01:09:10.892 --> 01:09:13.360
I can get nailed runnin' this next
red light, you all woudn't give a shit!

686
01:09:13.394 --> 01:09:15.362
- Right? It's only me!
- It doesn't work that way, Carter.

687
01:09:25.406 --> 01:09:28.375
I fuckin' hated French class!

688
01:09:28.409 --> 01:09:30.377
- Get control of yourself.
- That's what I'm doin'.

689
01:09:30.411 --> 01:09:33.380
I know what you're doing and
it's all right to be scared, Carter.

690
01:09:33.414 --> 01:09:36.383
I'm not afraid! All right?
I decide when it's time.

691
01:09:36.417 --> 01:09:39.386
I control my life, I control my death.

692
01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:44.380
Not to prove us how big
your balls are, not now!

693
01:09:45.426 --> 01:09:47.394
Carter, stop driving like such an asshole.

694
01:09:47.428 --> 01:09:49.396
What are you doin'?

695
01:09:50.431 --> 01:09:52.399
- Stop the fucking car!
- what are you doing!?

696
01:09:52.433 --> 01:09:54.401
Carter, put your hands back on the wheel!

697
01:09:54.435 --> 01:09:56.403
- Carter, stop!
- Put your hands on the wheel, Carter!

698
01:09:58.439 --> 01:10:00.407
Oh, shit.

699
01:10:02.443 --> 01:10:04.411
Okay, Carter, easy.

700
01:10:04.445 --> 01:10:09.405
I am so close to puking right now,
you don't even wanna know.

701
01:10:09.450 --> 01:10:12.419
We're afraid too, Carter,
but we're not going to quit.

702
01:10:12.453 --> 01:10:15.422
Stop what you're doing and
stop this fucking car!

703
01:10:15.456 --> 01:10:16.423
Damn it, Carter!

704
01:10:16.457 --> 01:10:20.416
I want you to stop this car right now!

705
01:10:37.478 --> 01:10:39.446
- Billy.
- Move it.

706
01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:42.449
- Open the door, Billy.
- You move the fucking car!

707
01:10:42.483 --> 01:10:45.452
- Open the fucking door.
- Move the car.

708
01:10:45.486 --> 01:10:48.455
- Can't you open the door?
- Easy. Open the fuckin' door.

709
01:10:48.489 --> 01:10:50.457
- Open the door!
- Billy, open the fuckin' door!

710
01:10:50.491 --> 01:10:52.459
- Billy, open it!
- Billy, open the door!

711
01:10:52.493 --> 01:10:54.461
Open the door!

712
01:10:57.999 --> 01:11:01.468
Carter, listen to me, don't do this.

713
01:11:05.439 --> 01:11:08.408
Goddamn it!
Get out of the fucking car.

714
01:11:08.442 --> 01:11:10.410
Carter, listen to me!

715
01:11:10.444 --> 01:11:15.404
This isn't the way. It's not the way,
get out of the car, come on!

716
01:11:15.449 --> 01:11:17.417
It's coming, it's coming!

717
01:11:20.454 --> 01:11:23.423
- Carter!
- It ain't my time.

718
01:11:34.468 --> 01:11:35.435
Oh, shit.

719
01:11:35.469 --> 01:11:39.428
Carter, listen to me. This isn't
the way, get out of the car, Carter!

720
01:11:39.473 --> 01:11:41.441
Carter, get out of the car!

721
01:11:41.475 --> 01:11:44.444
Come on!
Get out!

722
01:11:51.485 --> 01:11:55.444
I can't... I can't get out!


723
01:11:55.489 --> 01:11:56.456
Alex!

724
01:11:57.491 --> 01:11:58.458
No!

725
01:12:05.432 --> 01:12:07.400
Man, he really is next.

726
01:12:08.435 --> 01:12:10.403
Get out!

727
01:12:34.461 --> 01:12:37.430
All right, I saw it!
I saw the belt!

728
01:12:37.464 --> 01:12:39.432
- Scared now?
- It broke!

729
01:12:39.466 --> 01:12:42.435
Bullshit.
He saved your life again.

730
01:12:43.470 --> 01:12:46.439
That's right!
You're next, Carter!

731
01:12:46.473 --> 01:12:49.442
- I'm staying the fuck away from you!
- Shut up, Billy.

732
01:12:49.476 --> 01:12:51.444
Billy, we don't need this shit right now.

733
01:12:51.478 --> 01:12:54.447
I don't need it ever! What're you doin'?
Get away from him, he's next!

734
01:12:54.481 --> 01:12:56.449
Hey, fuck you, Billy!
I'm not dead!

735
01:12:56.483 --> 01:13:00.442
You will be.
You're dead. You're dead!

736
01:13:00.487 --> 01:13:03.388
And you ain't takin' me with you!

737
01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:21.408
Christ.

738
01:13:22.443 --> 01:13:24.411
You should've been next.
You should've been next

739
01:13:24.445 --> 01:13:26.914
after Lewton, that's the plan,
that's the design!

740
01:13:26.948 --> 01:13:29.917
- You should be fuckin' dead!
- Well, then you're the fuckin' devil!

741
01:13:29.951 --> 01:13:32.419
I saw the seat belt, I knew it would rip!

742
01:13:32.453 --> 01:13:35.422
That's how I saved him, just like
the plane, just like the explosion!

743
01:13:35.456 --> 01:13:37.424
- The police are coming.
- Fuck, I saved him!

744
01:13:37.458 --> 01:13:39.426
And because I saved him, it skipped Carter

745
01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:42.429
and went to the next person
in the path of the explosion: Billy!

746
01:13:42.463 --> 01:13:46.422
I have to see it.
And if I see it, then I intervene,

747
01:13:46.467 --> 01:13:48.435
and if I intervene, I cheat the design.

748
01:13:48.469 --> 01:13:51.438
What? Intervene?
What are you, God now!?

749
01:13:51.472 --> 01:13:55.431
God's not afraid to die!
Gods don't die! We do!

750
01:13:55.476 --> 01:13:57.444
- You know?
- Baby, you are losing it.

751
01:13:57.478 --> 01:14:00.447
Okay? The police will be here.
We have to get you back to my cabin,

752
01:14:00.481 --> 01:14:03.382
where you can hide out there and
get your head together. Okay?

753
01:14:03.417 --> 01:14:07.376
Okay, after Billy, I'm next.
I'm next.

754
01:14:07.421 --> 01:14:09.389
Then me.

755
01:14:09.423 --> 01:14:11.391
Hey-Hey-Hey, listen.

756
01:14:11.425 --> 01:14:14.394
I'm not gonna let it happen, okay?
Listen to me.

757
01:14:14.428 --> 01:14:15.395
- All right?
- Hey, hey!

758
01:14:15.429 --> 01:14:19.388
Why don't you two just
get the fuck outta here?

759
01:17:12.106 --> 01:17:13.373
Rusted.

760
01:17:14.408 --> 01:17:16.376
Tetanus.

761
01:17:17.411 --> 01:17:19.379
Nice one.

762
01:17:20.414 --> 01:17:22.382
I overlooked it.

763
01:17:23.417 --> 01:17:27.376
Tried to capitalize but I caught you.

764
01:17:27.421 --> 01:17:29.389
You fuck!

765
01:17:29.423 --> 01:17:31.391
I can beat you.

766
01:17:32.426 --> 01:17:34.394
Yeah. You're not forever.

767
01:17:34.428 --> 01:17:38.387
But I got this cabin rigged
to beat you now!

768
01:18:29.416 --> 01:18:31.384
She was there a minute ago.

769
01:18:31.418 --> 01:18:33.386
What are you talkin' about?

770
01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:35.388
I'm not turning him in.

771
01:18:36.423 --> 01:18:40.382
It's too dangerous for him
out there alone.

772
01:18:41.428 --> 01:18:44.397
- I go with you.
- You can't.

773
01:18:47.434 --> 01:18:50.403
Clear, you just tell us where he is.
Wait at home,

774
01:18:50.437 --> 01:18:56.398
I give you my word that we'll bring him
in safely, in protective custody.

775
01:19:24.404 --> 01:19:26.372
I never moved.

776
01:19:27.407 --> 01:19:30.376
Christa asked me to change seats,
but I never moved.

777
01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:33.379
I would've been up next to Tod.

778
01:19:33.413 --> 01:19:36.382
Fuck, why didn't I remember that!?

779
01:19:36.416 --> 01:19:40.375
I never moved, Clear's seat was
in front of mine.

780
01:19:55.435 --> 01:19:57.403
She's next.

781
01:20:35.475 --> 01:20:36.442
Alex!

782
01:20:38.478 --> 01:20:39.445
Alex!

783
01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:42.448
Go. Come on, get in the car!

784
01:20:42.482 --> 01:20:44.450
We're goin' around!
Schreck, get in the car!

785
01:20:44.484 --> 01:20:46.452
Come on!
Let's go!

786
01:21:51.985 --> 01:21:55.944
- There!
- Come on, let's go! Through here!

787
01:21:58.491 --> 01:21:59.458
Alex!

788
01:22:00.493 --> 01:22:03.394
Alex, we're trying to help you!

789
01:22:05.432 --> 01:22:07.400
Get away from it!

790
01:22:19.847 --> 01:22:22.415
Come on!

791
01:22:25.452 --> 01:22:26.419
Alex!

792
01:22:51.879 --> 01:22:53.446
Run!

793
01:23:39.459 --> 01:23:40.426
We lost him.

794
01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:43.429
From the direction,
there's only one place he's headed.

795
01:23:43.463 --> 01:23:45.431
Oh, shit.

796
01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:14.387
Clear!

797
01:25:27.434 --> 01:25:28.401
No.

798
01:25:34.441 --> 01:25:36.409
Oh, my God!

799
01:25:41.448 --> 01:25:43.416
Don't move! Stay there!

800
01:25:45.452 --> 01:25:47.420
Don't move! Don't move!
Don't touch anything!

801
01:25:47.454 --> 01:25:50.423
You're grounded by the tires, okay!?

802
01:26:19.419 --> 01:26:21.387
The car's gonna explode!

803
01:26:25.425 --> 01:26:28.394
I can only hold on for so long,
you know what to do.

804
01:26:28.428 --> 01:26:29.395
Don't!

805
01:26:29.429 --> 01:26:32.398
When I do this, it'll skip you
and it'll all be over.

806
01:26:32.432 --> 01:26:35.401
It's the only way
we can cheat death again.

807
01:26:35.435 --> 01:26:36.402
No, don't!

808
01:26:36.436 --> 01:26:41.396
Clear, I am not gonna let it beat us both.
You know what to do.

809
01:26:42.442 --> 01:26:45.411
I'll always be with you.

810
01:26:48.448 --> 01:26:49.415
No!

811
01:26:53.453 --> 01:26:56.422
- Alex!
- Alex, get away from there!

812
01:26:57.457 --> 01:26:58.424
No!

813
01:27:17.410 --> 01:27:18.377
Alex.

814
01:27:22.415 --> 01:27:25.384
Damn it!
You can't do this to me.

815
01:27:25.418 --> 01:27:28.387
Come on, baby.
Come on!

816
01:27:29.422 --> 01:27:30.389
Alex.

817
01:27:32.425 --> 01:27:34.393
Shit, he's not breathing.

818
01:27:34.427 --> 01:27:37.396
Hold on, Alex, come on!
Stay with me.

819
01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:10.351
<i>Au revoir. Bienvenue en France.
Bonjour. Bienvenue en France. Merci.</i>

821
01:28:10.396 --> 01:28:12.364
<i>Bonjour. Bienvenue en France.</i>

822
01:28:12.398 --> 01:28:14.366
Well, we made it.

823
01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:16.368
Paris... I can't believe it.

824
01:28:16.402 --> 01:28:19.371
You know, I just can't believe
we got on a plane again.

825
01:28:19.405 --> 01:28:21.373
You know what I'm sayin'?

826
01:28:43.930 --> 01:28:45.397
<i>Voila.</i>

827
01:28:45.431 --> 01:28:46.398
<i>Merci.</i>

828
01:28:48.434 --> 01:28:51.403
Wow. It's weird being here, huh?

829
01:28:51.437 --> 01:28:54.406
We finally completed a puzzle.

830
01:28:55.441 --> 01:28:59.400
It's just there's something missing,
you know.

831
01:29:01.447 --> 01:29:03.347
- To Terry.
- Yeah.

832
01:29:03.383 --> 01:29:04.350
To Tod.

833
01:29:04.384 --> 01:29:06.352
To all of our friends that can't be here.

834
01:29:06.386 --> 01:29:08.354
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

835
01:29:12.392 --> 01:29:13.359
What?

836
01:29:13.393 --> 01:29:16.362
If you would've told me 6 months ago...

837
01:29:16.396 --> 01:29:19.365
three of us would be
sitting here having a drink...

838
01:29:19.399 --> 01:29:20.366
Yeah.

839
01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:23.369
I don't know. I mean... sometimes
it just feels like the two of you are

840
01:29:23.403 --> 01:29:27.362
the only ones who can really understand.

841
01:29:29.409 --> 01:29:31.377
You were right, Browning.

842
01:29:31.411 --> 01:29:34.380
It did skip us, there was a design.

843
01:29:34.414 --> 01:29:36.382
We beat it. You know, we won.

844
01:29:36.416 --> 01:29:41.376
I think the only thing we won,
Carter, is a chance at a full life.

845
01:29:41.421 --> 01:29:44.390
A chance that I won't ever waste.

846
01:29:45.425 --> 01:29:50.886
Yeah. There's just somethin', you know?
Somethin' I can't figure out.

847
01:29:50.931 --> 01:29:53.399
- About what?
- About the design.

848
01:29:53.433 --> 01:29:56.402
Alex, just let it go, all right?

849
01:29:56.436 --> 01:30:00.395
So... just hear me out, all right?

850
01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:03.409
- Oh, my God.
- Just, listen, now.

851
01:30:03.443 --> 01:30:06.412
The path of the explosion determined
the order of our deaths, right?

852
01:30:06.446 --> 01:30:09.415
When I intervened and saved Carter,

853
01:30:09.449 --> 01:30:12.418
it skipped him and went to the next person
in the path and went to Billy.

854
01:30:12.452 --> 01:30:16.411
All right? And then it was Clear.
But I intervened and saved her,

855
01:30:16.456 --> 01:30:18.424
so it went to me, but in my case...

856
01:30:18.458 --> 01:30:20.426
no one intervened, right?

857
01:30:21.461 --> 01:30:24.430
I was thrown from that power line
by the explosion.

858
01:30:24.464 --> 01:30:27.433
So why did it skip you? right?

859
01:30:27.467 --> 01:30:30.436
How do we know that this isn't
exactly what was meant to happen?

860
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:33.439
That out of everyone on flight 180,

861
01:30:33.473 --> 01:30:35.441
you, me and Carter were meant to live.

862
01:30:35.475 --> 01:30:38.444
Maybe that was the design all along.

863
01:30:38.478 --> 01:30:42.437
- Or you could still be next.
- Shut up, Carter.

864
01:30:42.482 --> 01:30:44.450
What? I didn't make up the rules.

865
01:30:44.484 --> 01:30:46.452
I mean, somebody's gotta intervene
before death, can skip them.

866
01:30:46.486 --> 01:30:50.445
Alex proved that 3 times,
on the plane, me, you.

867
01:30:50.490 --> 01:30:54.449
For all I know, it could
circle back and get us all again.

868
01:30:54.494 --> 01:30:57.463
But I am the safest fucker in the world,

869
01:30:57.497 --> 01:30:59.465
because you're still... next.

870
01:31:04.437 --> 01:31:06.405
Can we just stop talking about this?

871
01:31:06.439 --> 01:31:11.399
<i>Let's figure out what we're gonna do
tomorrow. I've always wanted...</i>

872
01:31:24.457 --> 01:31:26.425
I'm gonna meet you guys back
at the hotel, okay?

873
01:31:26.459 --> 01:31:29.428
- Just wait, I'll go with you.
- No-No, just...

874
01:31:29.462 --> 01:31:32.431
just stay here, okay?
Clear, just stay here. All right?

875
01:31:32.465 --> 01:31:35.434
See? It's true.
I told you you were next, man.

876
01:31:35.468 --> 01:31:38.437
Stop it, Carter.
Alex, wait.

877
01:31:38.471 --> 01:31:41.940
No, Clear, stay there, Okay?
Stay away.

878
01:31:49.983 --> 01:31:51.450
Alex!

880
01:32:09.936 --> 01:32:11.403
Alex!

881
01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:16.408
I told you were next.

882
01:32:16.442 --> 01:32:18.410
Then it just skipped me.

883
01:32:18.444 --> 01:32:20.412
So who's next?
