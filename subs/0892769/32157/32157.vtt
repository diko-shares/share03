{36199}{36285}THAT'S IT! NO OFFICERS, NO ORDERS.|EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF.
{36285}{36319}THAT AIN'T THE WAY, BROWN.
{36339}{36384}NEVER DID NOTHIN' FOR NOBODY.
{36395}{36446}NOW, SHIP'S SPLIT...
{36446}{36507}BUT THE BULKHEAD'S SEPERATING THE TANKS, 8 AND 9.
{36507}{36578}AND MR.SYBERT SAYS THAT THE OTHER|TANKS ARE NOT FRACTURED, SO...
{36582}{36640}THE AIR IN THE BALLAST TANKS|SHOULD KEEP US AFLOAT.
{36640}{36756}BUT MR.SYBERT ALSO SAYS THAT...|MR.SYBERT SAYS THIS, MR.SYBERT SAYS THAT.
{36756}{36820}HE'S A BIG BOY. LET HIM SAY IT HIMSELF.|HE IS RIGHTHERE.
{36860}{36889}GO AHEAD.
{37033}{37091}AH..AH, WE'RE SINKING.
{37150}{37194}YEAH, BUT THE WHISTLE WORKS.
{37199}{37303}SO WE SHOULD KEEP BLOWIN' THAT.|MAYBE SOMEBODY WILL HEAR IT.
{37343}{37419}I DO NOT KNOW, BUT WE'RE DEFINITELY SINKING.
{37419}{37497}BECAUSE THE CRACK IN THE ENGINE ROOM|IS TAKIN' ON TOO MUCH WATER.
{37567}{37605}PUMPS CAN'T KEEP UP.
{37605}{37699}IF THE WATER REACHES THE AIR INTAKE IN THE ENGINE,|WE GONNA EH, LOSE ALL THE POWER.
{37700}{37768}IF WE LOSE ALL THE POWER, WE LOSE THE PUMPS.|WE LOSE THE PUMPS...
{37795}{37843}THEN WE GONNA DROP REALLY QUICK.
{37845}{37902}HOW LONG WE GOT BEFORE THAT HAPPENS?
{37954}{38007}FOUR, MAYBE FIVE HOURS.
{38045}{38099}WE NEED TO BUY OURSELVES SOME TIME.
{38121}{38171}SO SOMEBODY CAN FIND US.
{38172}{38208}IF ANYBODY IS EVEN LOOKIN'.
{38209}{38298}EVEN IF THEY DO KNOW WE'RE HERE,|THE SEA IS BIG ENOUGH.
{38310}{38360}I MEAN, IT RIPPED THIS THING IN HALF.
{38365}{38411}HOW WILL THEY HELL ARE WE GONNA GET OUT?
{38411}{38477}THAT'S WHY I'M SAYIN' WE GOTTA LAUNCH THE LIFEBOATS.
{38477}{38551}OUR LUCKS RUNNIN' OUT.|I DON'T BELIEVE IN LUCK, BROOM.
{38557}{38660}PUT THOSE LIFEBOATS OUT THERE IN THE SEAS,|WON'T LAST 12 SECONDS.
{38660}{38724}YOU AND QUIREY...BOTH JUST WANNA SIT AROUND DO NOTHIN.
{38724}{38817}YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA, SYBERT,|OR YOU JUST GONNA HIDE DOWN BELOW?
{39001}{39042}WE'LL RUN HER GROUND.
{39059}{39088}WHAT? DO WHAT?
{39089}{39142}YOU WANNA RUN HER GROUND, SYBERT?
{39146}{39208}EVEN IF IT COULD WITH HALF A SHIP, WHY WOULD YA?
{39208}{39282}THIS WILL BREAK APART AND|DUMP US ALL OUT IN THE SEA.
{39282}{39366}IT'S OUR ONLY CHOICE.|WE FIND A SOFT SHORE AND LAY HER UP.
{39366}{39406}SLOW THE WATER THAT'S COMIN' IN,
{39406}{39458}STAY IN THE SAME SPOT AND BLOW THE WHISTLE,
{39458}{39517}WILL GIVE US A CHANCE FOR SOMEONE|TRYING TO TO LOOK FOR US TO FIND US.
{39517}{39573}YOU GONNA STAY ON THE SHIP WITHOUT HYDRAULICS?
{39589}{39637}THAT'S YOUR PLAN?|HOW'S THAT GONNA WORK?
{39656}{39700}WE'LL BUILD A MANUAL TILLER.
{39700}{39749}HEY SYBERT, WHY...WHY SHOULD WE EVEN LISTEN TO YOU?
{39749}{39796}ALL YOU EVER CARED ABOUT, WAS THIS SHIP.

{39859}{39907}ME? I WANNA GO IN A LIFEBOAT.
{39924}{39948}LOOK.
{40003}{40080}INSERT A STEEL BEAM INTO THIS STEERING QUADRANT.
{40114}{40177}WE PUT PULLEYS ON THE END OF IT FOR LEVERAGE.
{40229}{40276}AND WE WILL MOVE IT MANUALLY.
