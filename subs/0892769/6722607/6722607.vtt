00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:36.287
<i>[boy] This is Berk.</i>

2
00:00:36.454 --> 00:00:38.414
<i>It's twelve days north of hopeless</i>

3
00:00:38.581 --> 00:00:41.209
<i>and a few degrees south
of freezing to death.</i>

4
00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:44.754
<i>It's located solidly
on the meridian of misery.</i>

5
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.634
<i>My village. In a word, sturdy.</i>

6
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.639
<i>It's been here for seven generations,
but every single building is new.</i>

7
00:00:54.805 --> 00:00:58.851
<i>We have fishing, hunting
and a charming view of the sunsets.</i>

8
00:00:59.018 --> 00:01:01.729
<i>The only problems are the pests.</i>

9
00:01:03.064 --> 00:01:06.442
<i>You see, most places
have mice or mosquitoes.</i>

10
00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:08.361
<i>We have...</i>

11
00:01:11.656 --> 00:01:13.074
...dragons.

12
00:01:14.116 --> 00:01:16.786
<i>[boy] Most people would leave. Not us.</i>

13
00:01:16.953 --> 00:01:20.373
<i>We're Vikings.
We have stubbornness issues.</i>

14
00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:23.709
<i>My name is Hiccup.</i>

15
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.421
<i>Great name, I know.
But it's not the worst.</i>

16
00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:30.883
<i>Parents believe a hideous name
will frighten off gnomes and trolls.</i>

17
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.427
<i>Like our charming Viking
demeanour wouldn't do that.</i>

18
00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:35.763
[roars] Morning!

19
00:01:38.057 --> 00:01:39.892
- What are you doing here?!
- Get inside!

20
00:01:40.059 --> 00:01:43.020
- What are you doing out?!
- Get back inside!

21
00:01:45.106 --> 00:01:47.441
Hiccup! What is he doing...?

22
00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:49.735
What are you doing out?!
Get inside!

23
00:01:49.902 --> 00:01:53.739
<i>[Hiccup] That's Stoick the Vast,
chief of the tribe.</i>

24
00:01:53.906 --> 00:01:58.953
<i>They say when he was a baby, he popped
a dragon's head clean off its shoulders.</i>

25
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.871
<i>Do I believe it?
Yes, I do.</i>

26
00:02:01.038 --> 00:02:02.081
What have we got?

27
00:02:02.248 --> 00:02:03.958
Gronckles. Nadders.
Zipplebacks.

28
00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:06.752
Oh, and Hoark saw
a Monstrous Nightmare.

29
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.588
- Any Night Furies?
- [man] None so far.

30
00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:12.174
- Good.
- [man 2] Hoist the torches!

31
00:02:12.842 --> 00:02:14.218
[grunts]

32
00:02:18.306 --> 00:02:20.349
Oh! Nice of you to join the party!

33
00:02:20.516 --> 00:02:22.184
I thought you'd been carried off!

34
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:26.772
Who, me? Come on,
I'm way too muscular for their taste.

35
00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.942
They wouldn't know
what to do with all this.

36
00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.194
They need toothpicks, don't they?

37
00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:36.490
<i>[Hiccup] The meathead with attitude
and interchangeable hands is Gobber.</i>

38
00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:38.784
<i>I've been his apprentice
since I was little.</i>

39
00:02:38.951 --> 00:02:41.120
<i>Well, littler.</i>

40
00:02:41.287 --> 00:02:45.291
Move to the lower defences.
We'll counterattack with the catapults.

41
00:02:47.585 --> 00:02:50.921
<i>See? Old village,
lots and lots of new houses.</i>

42
00:02:51.088 --> 00:02:53.632
- Fire!
- [girl] Let's go!

43
00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.552
<i>[Hiccup] That's Fishlegs, Snotlout,</i>

44
00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:58.471
<i>the twins: Ruffnut and Tuffnut...</i>

45
00:02:58.637 --> 00:02:59.889
<i>...and...</i>

46
00:03:01.724 --> 00:03:04.143
<i>...Astrid.</i>

47
00:03:13.611 --> 00:03:15.905
<i>Oh, their job is so much cooler.</i>

48
00:03:16.072 --> 00:03:19.033
- Eh!
- Come on. Let me out, please.

49
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.493
I need to make my mark.

50
00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.412
You've made plenty of marks,
all in the wrong places.

51
00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.539
Please, two minutes. I'll kill a dragon.

52
00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:28.751
My life will get infinitely better.
I might even get a date.

53
00:03:28.918 --> 00:03:31.545
You can't lift a hammer.
You can't swing an axe.

54
00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:33.381
You can't even throw one of these!

55
00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:38.677
OK, fine, but this will throw it for me.

56
00:03:38.844 --> 00:03:40.262
- Ohh!
- [groans]

57
00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:42.973
See? Now this right here
is what I'm talking about!

58
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.102
- [stammers] Mild calibration issue...
- Hiccup!

59
00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:48.938
If you ever want to get
out there to fight dragons...

60
00:03:49.105 --> 00:03:51.857
...you need to stop all this.

61
00:03:52.024 --> 00:03:54.068
But you just pointed to all of me.

62
00:03:54.235 --> 00:03:57.029
Yes, that's it!
Stop being all of you.

63
00:03:57.196 --> 00:03:59.740
- Ohh...
- Oh, yes.

64
00:03:59.907 --> 00:04:02.326
You, sir, are playing
a dangerous game.

65
00:04:02.493 --> 00:04:07.123
Keeping this much
raw Vikingness contained?

66
00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:09.750
- There will be consequences!
- I'll take my chances.

67
00:04:09.917 --> 00:04:12.086
Sword. Sharpen. Now.

68
00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:16.132
<i>[Hiccup] One day, I'll get out there.</i>

69
00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:18.050
<i>Because killing a dragon...</i>

70
00:04:18.217 --> 00:04:21.095
<i>...is everything around here.</i>

71
00:04:21.262 --> 00:04:24.807
<i>A Nadder head is sure
to get me at least noticed.</i>

72
00:04:24.974 --> 00:04:27.393
<i>Gronckles are tough.
Taking down one of those</i>

73
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.979
<i>would definitely get me a girlfriend.</i>

74
00:04:30.146 --> 00:04:31.647
<i>A Zippleback?</i>

75
00:04:31.814 --> 00:04:33.190
- [spits]
- [people scream]

76
00:04:33.357 --> 00:04:35.818
<i>[Hiccup] Exotic. Two heads,
twice the status.</i>

77
00:04:35.985 --> 00:04:37.361
They found the sheep!

78
00:04:37.528 --> 00:04:39.780
Concentrate fire over the lower bank.

79
00:04:40.698 --> 00:04:41.991
- Fire!
- [grunts]

80
00:04:42.158 --> 00:04:44.702
<i>And then there's
the Monstrous Nightmare.</i>

81
00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:47.997
<i>Only the best Vikings go after those.</i>

82
00:04:48.164 --> 00:04:51.542
<i>They have this nasty habit
of setting themselves on fire.</i>

83
00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:53.627
[snarling]

84
00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:56.172
Reload! I'll take care of this.

85
00:04:57.673 --> 00:05:01.260
<i>But the ultimate prize
is the dragon no one's ever seen.</i>

86
00:05:01.427 --> 00:05:04.013
<i>- We call it the...</i>
- Night Fury!

87
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.931
- Get down!
- [screams]

88
00:05:08.392 --> 00:05:09.894
Jump!

89
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.440
<i>This thing never steals food,
never shows itself, and...</i>

90
00:05:16.317 --> 00:05:17.860
<i>...never misses.</i>

91
00:05:18.027 --> 00:05:20.446
<i>No one has ever killed a Night Fury.</i>

92
00:05:20.613 --> 00:05:22.907
<i>That's why I'm going to be the first.</i>

93
00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:26.118
Man the fort, Hiccup.
They need me out there.

94
00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:30.289
Stay. Put. There.

95
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.793
You know what I mean. [yells]

96
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.213
- [man] Where are you going?
- Yeah, I know!

97
00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.131
- [woman] Hiccup!
- Be right back!

98
00:05:39.882 --> 00:05:41.675
[sheep braying]

99
00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:45.596
[man] Let's get 'em!

100
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.765
[Stoick] Mind yourselves!

101
00:05:47.932 --> 00:05:49.850
The devils still have
some juice in them!

102
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.937
[grunts]

103
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.277
[dragon roars in distance]

104
00:06:00.444 --> 00:06:02.321
Come on.
Give me something to shoot at.

105
00:06:02.488 --> 00:06:05.407
- Give me something to shoot at.
- [dragon roars]

106
00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.746
[dragon approaching]

107
00:06:13.624 --> 00:06:15.167
[dragon divebombing]

108
00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:20.089
- [weapon fires]
- Aah!

109
00:06:21.632 --> 00:06:24.343
[dragon roars]

110
00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:28.847
I hit it. Yes, I hit it!

111
00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:31.016
- Did anybody see that?
- [growls]

112
00:06:32.518 --> 00:06:33.602
Except for you.

113
00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:37.690
[Hiccup screaming]

114
00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:41.819
- [sighs] Do not let them escape!
- [man] Right!

115
00:06:41.986 --> 00:06:43.612
- [dragon growling]
- [screams]

116
00:06:45.656 --> 00:06:46.949
[panting]

117
00:06:47.366 --> 00:06:48.617
[dragon growls]

118
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:57.418
[roars]

119
00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:02.381
- [burps]
- You're all out.

120
00:07:02.548 --> 00:07:04.592
[grunting]

121
00:07:08.262 --> 00:07:11.223
<i>[Hiccup] Oh, and there's
one more thing you need to know.</i>

122
00:07:15.227 --> 00:07:16.520
[screams]

123
00:07:18.314 --> 00:07:20.649
- [woman yells]
- [metal torch clanging]

124
00:07:20.816 --> 00:07:23.819
- [glass breaks]
- Sorry, Dad.

125
00:07:23.986 --> 00:07:25.779
[screaming]

126
00:07:25.946 --> 00:07:29.575
- [sheep braying]
- [dragons growling]

127
00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:34.705
OK, but I hit a Night Fury. Aah!

128
00:07:35.247 --> 00:07:37.541
It's not like the last few times, Dad!

129
00:07:37.708 --> 00:07:39.293
I really, actually hit it!

130
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.087
You guys were busy.
I had a very clear shot.

131
00:07:42.254 --> 00:07:45.424
It went down off Raven Point.
Let's get a search party...

132
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:49.219
Stop! Just stop.

133
00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:52.723
Every time you step outside,
disaster follows.

134
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.017
Can you not see that
I have bigger problems?

135
00:07:55.184 --> 00:07:58.479
Winter is almost here and I have
an entire village to feed!

136
00:07:59.563 --> 00:08:03.651
Between you and me, the village could do
with a little less feeding.

137
00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.486
This isn't a joke, Hiccup!

138
00:08:05.653 --> 00:08:09.114
[groans] Why can't you
follow the simplest orders?

139
00:08:09.281 --> 00:08:14.161
I can't stop myself. I see a dragon
and I have to just kill it.

140
00:08:14.328 --> 00:08:16.038
It's who I am, Dad.

141
00:08:16.205 --> 00:08:18.415
Oh, you're many things, Hiccup.

142
00:08:18.582 --> 00:08:21.460
But a dragon killer is not one of them.

143
00:08:21.627 --> 00:08:24.880
Get back to the house.
Make sure he gets there.

144
00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:27.966
I have his mess to clean up.

145
00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:30.803
- [girl laughing]
- Quite the performance.

146
00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:33.514
I've never seen anyone
mess up that badly. That helped.

147
00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:36.266
Thank you, thank you. I was trying.

148
00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:38.018
Ow! [grunts]

149
00:08:40.062 --> 00:08:42.231
- I really did hit one.
- [Gobber] Sure, Hiccup.

150
00:08:42.398 --> 00:08:44.191
- He never listens.
- It runs in the family.

151
00:08:44.358 --> 00:08:47.403
When he does, it's with
this disappointed scowl,

152
00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:49.697
like someone skimped
on meat in his sandwich.

153
00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:51.407
[mimics Stoick]
"Excuse me, barmaid.

154
00:08:51.573 --> 00:08:53.909
I'm afraid you brought me
the wrong offspring.

155
00:08:54.076 --> 00:08:56.704
I ordered an extra-large boy
with beefy arms,

156
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.872
extra guts and glory on the side.

157
00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:01.917
This here, this is a talking fishbone."

158
00:09:02.084 --> 00:09:04.044
You're thinking about this wrong.

159
00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:06.004
It's not so much what you look like,

160
00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:09.466
it's what's inside that he can't stand.

161
00:09:09.633 --> 00:09:11.468
Thank you for summing that up.

162
00:09:11.635 --> 00:09:15.514
Look, the point is, stop trying so hard
to be something you're not.

163
00:09:15.681 --> 00:09:17.766
I just want to be one of you guys.

164
00:09:18.684 --> 00:09:20.561
- [door closes]
- [sighs]

165
00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:31.071
[Stoick] Either we finish them
or they'll finish us!

166
00:09:31.238 --> 00:09:33.866
It's the only way we'll be rid of them.

167
00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:36.118
If we find the nest and destroy it,

168
00:09:36.285 --> 00:09:39.288
the dragons will leave.
They'll find another home!

169
00:09:39.455 --> 00:09:42.040
One more search before the ice sets in.

170
00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:44.168
Those ships never come back.

171
00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:48.839
We're Vikings. It's an occupational
hazard. Now who's with me?!

172
00:09:49.006 --> 00:09:50.048
[man] Count me out.

173
00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:52.342
- Today's no good for me.
- I have to do my axe returns.

174
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:55.512
All right. Those who stay
will look after Hiccup.

175
00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:58.474
- [woman] To the ships!
- Aye. That's more like it.

176
00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:01.894
Right. I'll pack my undies.

177
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.938
No, I need you to stay
and train some new recruits.

178
00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:09.610
Perfect. And, while I'm busy,
Hiccup can cover the stall.

179
00:10:09.777 --> 00:10:12.946
Molten steel, razor-sharp blades,
lots of time to himself.

180
00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:15.032
What could possibly go wrong?

181
00:10:15.199 --> 00:10:17.326
[groans] What am I going
to do with him, Gobber?

182
00:10:17.493 --> 00:10:18.827
Put him in training.

183
00:10:18.994 --> 00:10:21.205
- No, I'm serious.
- So am I.

184
00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:24.249
He'd be killed before
the first dragon is out of its cage.

185
00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:25.959
- You don't know that.
- I do, actually.

186
00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:27.586
- No, you don't.
- No, I do.

187
00:10:27.753 --> 00:10:29.129
No, you don't.

188
00:10:29.296 --> 00:10:30.923
Listen, you know what he's like.

189
00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:34.843
From the time he could crawl,
he's been... different.

190
00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:39.306
[sighs] He doesn't listen.
He has the attention span of a sparrow.

191
00:10:39.473 --> 00:10:43.352
I take him fishing and
he goes hunting for trolls!

192
00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:46.313
Trolls exist.
They steal your socks.

193
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.233
But only the left ones.
What's with that?

194
00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:50.692
- When I was a boy...
- Here we go.

195
00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:53.987
...my father told me to bang my head
against a rock and I did it.

196
00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:56.698
I thought it was crazy,
but I didn't question him.

197
00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:58.867
- And you know what happened?
- You got a headache.

198
00:10:59.034 --> 00:11:01.411
That rock split in two.

199
00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:04.248
It taught me what
a Viking could do, Gobber.

200
00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:08.585
He could crush mountains,
level forests, tame seas!

201
00:11:09.753 --> 00:11:13.382
Even as a boy, I knew what I was,
what I had to become.

202
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.510
Hiccup is not that boy.

203
00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:18.887
You can't stop him, Stoick.

204
00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:21.223
You can only prepare him.

205
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.811
I know it seems hopeless, but you won't
always be around to protect him.

206
00:11:25.978 --> 00:11:29.398
He's going to get out there again.
He's probably out there now.

207
00:11:31.984 --> 00:11:33.777
[birds singing in distance]

208
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:40.200
[deep breath]

209
00:11:40.659 --> 00:11:42.077
[exhales]

210
00:11:46.874 --> 00:11:49.960
[sighs] Oh, the gods hate me.

211
00:11:50.127 --> 00:11:53.672
Some people lose their knife
or their mug. Not me.

212
00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:56.133
I manage to lose an entire dragon.

213
00:11:57.801 --> 00:11:58.886
Ow!

214
00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:00.178
[bird calling, faint]

215
00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:23.452
[gasps, pants]

216
00:12:33.337 --> 00:12:35.839
[sighs, gasps]

217
00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:48.644
Oh, wow. I did it.

218
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:52.564
Ohh, I did it. This...
This fixes everything! Yes!

219
00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:54.942
I have brought down
this mighty beast!

220
00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:56.777
[dragon bellows]

221
00:12:56.944 --> 00:12:58.612
[heavy breathing]

222
00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:16.088
[guttural growl]

223
00:13:18.674 --> 00:13:20.300
[exhales]

224
00:13:21.093 --> 00:13:24.972
[exhales] I'm going to kill you, dragon.

225
00:13:25.973 --> 00:13:30.102
Then I'll cut out your heart
and take it to my father.

226
00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:33.897
I am a Viking. I am a Viking!

227
00:13:34.648 --> 00:13:36.108
[grunts]

228
00:13:36.817 --> 00:13:39.194
[deep breathing]

229
00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:51.790
[moans]

230
00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:09.516
I did this.

231
00:14:19.651 --> 00:14:20.902
[knife saws rope]

232
00:14:26.158 --> 00:14:28.285
- [growling]
- [gasps]

233
00:14:29.995 --> 00:14:32.080
[low growl]

234
00:14:32.998 --> 00:14:35.375
[panting] Uh...

235
00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:43.925
[snarls]

236
00:14:45.677 --> 00:14:47.929
[roaring]

237
00:14:50.682 --> 00:14:53.101
[roaring]

238
00:14:53.268 --> 00:14:54.936
[panting]

239
00:14:56.938 --> 00:14:59.024
- [dragon thumping]
- [growling]

240
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.986
[wailing]

241
00:15:08.075 --> 00:15:09.618
[moans]

242
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.873
[door opens]

243
00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:27.135
- Hiccup.
- Dad, uh...

244
00:15:27.302 --> 00:15:29.262
...I have to talk to you, Dad.

245
00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:31.389
I need to speak with you, too, son.

246
00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:36.561
- I don't want to fight dragons.
- It's time you learn to fight dragons.

247
00:15:36.728 --> 00:15:39.439
- Uh, you go first.
- No, you go first.

248
00:15:39.606 --> 00:15:41.233
All right. [sighs]

249
00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:42.692
You get your wish.

250
00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:45.195
Dragon training...
you start in the morning.

251
00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:47.572
Oh, man, I should have
gone first. Uh...

252
00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:49.449
I was thinking, you know,

253
00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:52.702
we have a surplus
of dragon-fighting Vikings,

254
00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:56.748
but do we have enough bread-making
Vikings or small-home-repair Vikings?

255
00:15:56.915 --> 00:15:58.792
- You'll need this.
- [grunts]

256
00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:00.794
I don't want to fight dragons.

257
00:16:00.961 --> 00:16:03.755
- [chuckles] Come on. Yes, you do.
- Rephrase.

258
00:16:03.922 --> 00:16:06.424
Dad, I can't kill dragons.

259
00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:08.343
But you will kill dragons.

260
00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.096
No, I'm really very extra-sure
that I won't.

261
00:16:11.263 --> 00:16:13.598
- It's time, Hiccup.
- Can you not hear me?

262
00:16:13.765 --> 00:16:15.892
This is serious, son.

263
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:21.356
When you carry this axe,
you carry all of us with you.

264
00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:25.152
Which means you walk like us,
you talk like us...

265
00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:27.237
...you think like us.

266
00:16:27.404 --> 00:16:29.531
No more of... this.

267
00:16:29.698 --> 00:16:31.616
You just gestured to all of me.

268
00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:35.078
- Deal?
- This conversation is very one-sided.

269
00:16:35.245 --> 00:16:39.249
- Deal?
- [sighs] Deal.

270
00:16:41.168 --> 00:16:43.378
Good.

271
00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:45.213
Train hard.

272
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.841
I'll be back. Probably.

273
00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:50.177
And I'll be here.

274
00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:52.304
Maybe.

275
00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:55.724
Welcome to dragon training!

276
00:16:55.891 --> 00:16:57.976
No turning back.

277
00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:17.537
I hope I get some serious burns.

278
00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:21.374
I'm hoping for some mauling,
like on my shoulder or back.

279
00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:23.835
Yeah, it's only fun
if you get a scar out of it.

280
00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:27.380
Yeah, no kidding, right?
Pain. Love it.

281
00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:29.257
Oh, great. Who let him in?

282
00:17:29.424 --> 00:17:31.885
Let's get started!
The recruit who does best

283
00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:35.096
will win the honour of
killing his first dragon

284
00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:36.806
in front of the entire village.

285
00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:40.810
Hiccup already killed a Night Fury,
so does that disqualify him?

286
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.605
Can I transfer to the class
with the cool Vikings?

287
00:17:43.772 --> 00:17:46.316
Don't worry.
You're small and weak...

288
00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:48.276
that'll make you less of a target.

289
00:17:48.443 --> 00:17:50.320
They'll see you as sick or insane

290
00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:53.698
and go after the more Viking-like
teens instead. [laughs]

291
00:17:53.865 --> 00:17:57.160
Behind these doors are just
a few of the many species

292
00:17:57.327 --> 00:17:58.453
you will learn to fight!

293
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.122
- The Deadly Nadder!
- Speed 8, armour 16.

294
00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:04.167
- The Hideous Zippleback.
- Plus 11 stealth. Times 2.

295
00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:06.336
- The Monstrous Nightmare.
- Firepower 15.

296
00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:08.755
- The Terrible Terror.
- Attack 8, venom 12.

297
00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:10.382
Can you stop that?!

298
00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:13.426
And the Gronckle.

299
00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:15.679
- [whispers] Jaw strength 8.
- Whoa! Whoa!

300
00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:17.347
Wait, aren't you gonna teach us first?

301
00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:20.058
I believe in learning on the job.

302
00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:22.102
[snarling]

303
00:18:22.269 --> 00:18:24.980
[Gobber] Today is about survival.
If you get blasted...

304
00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:28.942
...you're dead!
What's the first thing you'll need?

305
00:18:29.109 --> 00:18:30.652
- A doctor?
- Plus 5 speed?

306
00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:33.196
- A shield.
- Shields. Go!

307
00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:37.033
Your most important piece
of equipment is your shield!

308
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.870
If you must choose between a sword
or a shield, take the shield!

309
00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:43.081
- Let go of my shield!
- There are a million shields!

310
00:18:43.248 --> 00:18:45.792
Take that one. It has a flower...
girls like flowers. Aah!

311
00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:48.253
Oops, this one has blood on it.

312
00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:51.673
- [Gobber] Tuffnut, Ruffnut! You're out!
- What?

313
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.134
Shields are good for another thing.

314
00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:58.054
Noise! Make lots of it
to throw off a dragon's aim!

315
00:18:58.221 --> 00:19:00.598
- [growls]
- [Gobber] All dragons have

316
00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:04.102
a limited number of shots.
How many does a Gronckle have?

317
00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:05.562
- Five?
- No, six!

318
00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:07.731
[Gobber] Correct, six!
That's one for each of you!

319
00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:10.400
- Fishlegs, out!
- Aaah!

320
00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:13.403
- Hiccup, get in there!
- Aaah!

321
00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:17.157
- [snarls]
- I moved into my parents' basement.

322
00:19:17.324 --> 00:19:19.284
Come by sometime and work out.

323
00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:22.787
- You look like you work out. Aah!
- [Gobber] Snotlout! You're done!

324
00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:25.790
- So it's just you and me, huh?
- Nope, just you.

325
00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:29.669
- [Gobber] One shot left!
- [panting]

326
00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:32.005
Hiccup!

327
00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:36.176
- [gasping]
- [snarls]

328
00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:41.556
And that's six.

329
00:19:41.723 --> 00:19:44.934
Go back to bed, you overgrown sausage!

330
00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:49.647
You'll get another chance,
don't you worry.

331
00:19:49.814 --> 00:19:52.859
Remember, a dragon will always,

332
00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:56.404
always go for the kill.

333
00:19:56.571 --> 00:19:58.490
- [door rattles]
- [dragon growls]

334
00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.247
So... why didn't you?

335
00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.351
[chirping]

336
00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:34.776
This was stupid.

337
00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:42.784
- [gasps]
- [dragon growls]

338
00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:44.536
[scraping]

339
00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:47.914
[growling]

340

[bellows, growls]

345
00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:20.864
Why don't you just fly away?

346

[low growl]

351
00:21:57.066 --> 00:21:59.736
<i>[Gobber] Where did Astrid
go wrong in the ring today?</i>

352
00:21:59.903 --> 00:22:02.655
[Astrid] I mistimed my somersault dive.
It was sloppy.

353
00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:05.283
- It threw off my reverse tumble.
- [Ruffnut] Yeah, we noticed.

354
00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.619
No, no, you were great.
That was so "Astrid."

355
00:22:07.785 --> 00:22:10.455
She's right. You have to be
tough on yourselves.

356
00:22:10.622 --> 00:22:12.207
Where did Hiccup go wrong?

357
00:22:12.373 --> 00:22:14.667
- Uh, he showed up.
- He didn't get eaten.

358
00:22:14.834 --> 00:22:16.753
He's never where he should be.

359
00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.630
Thank you, Astrid.

360
00:22:18.796 --> 00:22:23.510
You need to live and breathe this stuff.
The dragon manual.

361
00:22:23.676 --> 00:22:27.931
Everything we know about
every dragon we know of.

362
00:22:28.097 --> 00:22:30.099
- [thunder rumbles]
- Ah.

363
00:22:30.266 --> 00:22:32.560
No attacks tonight. Study up.

364
00:22:32.727 --> 00:22:34.354
Wait, you mean read?

365
00:22:34.521 --> 00:22:35.730
While we're still alive?

366
00:22:35.897 --> 00:22:37.982
Why read words when you
can just kill the stuff

367
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:39.692
the words tell you stuff about?

368
00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:42.779
I've read it seven times.
There's this water dragon

369
00:22:42.946 --> 00:22:46.533
that sprays boiling water at your face.
And there's this other one...

370
00:22:46.699 --> 00:22:48.284
Yeah. That sounds great.

371
00:22:48.451 --> 00:22:51.663
- There was a chance I'd read it...
- But now...

372
00:22:51.829 --> 00:22:53.623
You guys read. I'll go kill stuff.

373
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:55.792
Another one has spines like trees.

374
00:22:55.959 --> 00:22:58.461
- So I guess we'll share?
- Read it.

375
00:22:58.628 --> 00:23:03.383
Uh, all mine, then. Wow.
So, OK, I'll see you...

376
00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:05.385
- [door slams]
- ...tomorrow.

377
00:23:11.266 --> 00:23:12.767
[thunder rumbles]

378
00:23:15.436 --> 00:23:17.480
Dragon classifications.

379
00:23:17.647 --> 00:23:21.067
Strike class.
Fear class. Mystery class.

380
00:23:21.234 --> 00:23:23.278
- [thunder rumbles]
- Thunderdrum.

381
00:23:23.444 --> 00:23:26.823
This reclusive dragon inhabits sea caves
and dark tide pools.

382
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:29.867
When startled, the Thunderdrum
produces a concussive sound

383
00:23:30.034 --> 00:23:31.703
that can kill a man at close range.

384
00:23:31.869 --> 00:23:34.956
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.

385
00:23:35.123 --> 00:23:38.751
Timberjack. This gigantic creature
has razor-sharp wings

386
00:23:38.918 --> 00:23:40.920
that can slice through full-grown trees.

387
00:23:41.087 --> 00:23:44.132
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.

388
00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:47.677
Scauldron. Sprays scalding
water at its victim.

389
00:23:47.844 --> 00:23:49.053
Extremely dangerous.

390
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.722
- [thunderclap]
- [gasps]

391
00:23:54.892 --> 00:23:59.397
Changewing. Even newly hatched dragons
can spray acid. Kill on sight.

392
00:23:59.564 --> 00:24:03.109
Gronckle. Zippleback. The Skrill.

393
00:24:03.276 --> 00:24:06.654
Bone Knapper. Whispering Death.

394
00:24:08.031 --> 00:24:09.949
Burns its victims.
Buries its victims.

395
00:24:10.116 --> 00:24:13.244
Chokes its victims.
Turns its victims inside out.

396
00:24:13.411 --> 00:24:16.080
Extremely dangerous.
Extremely dangerous.

397
00:24:16.247 --> 00:24:19.667
Kill on sight.
Kill on sight. Kill on sight.

398
00:24:21.794 --> 00:24:23.421
Night Fury.

399
00:24:23.588 --> 00:24:27.592
Speed unknown.
Size unknown.

400
00:24:27.759 --> 00:24:31.763
The unholy offspring
of lightning and death itself.

401
00:24:31.929 --> 00:24:33.848
Never engage this dragon.

402
00:24:34.015 --> 00:24:35.850
Your only chance:

403
00:24:36.017 --> 00:24:38.186
hide and pray it does not find you.

404
00:24:52.116 --> 00:24:54.035
[Stoick] I can almost smell them.

405
00:24:54.202 --> 00:24:55.912
They're close.

406
00:24:56.954 --> 00:24:58.498
Steady.

407
00:25:09.008 --> 00:25:10.468
Take us in.

408
00:25:10.635 --> 00:25:13.471
Hard to port.
For Helheim's Gate.

409
00:25:13.638 --> 00:25:15.390
[man] Hard to port!

410
00:25:18.893 --> 00:25:20.561
[Stoick] Steady!

411
00:25:31.656 --> 00:25:32.907
[roaring]

412
00:25:33.074 --> 00:25:35.368
Hey, you know,
I just happened to notice

413
00:25:35.535 --> 00:25:37.370
the book had nothing on Night Furies.

414
00:25:37.537 --> 00:25:39.706
Is there another book, or a sequel?

415
00:25:39.872 --> 00:25:42.041
Maybe a Night Fury pamphlet?

416
00:25:43.167 --> 00:25:45.086
- Whoa!
- [Gobber] Focus, Hiccup!

417
00:25:45.253 --> 00:25:46.587
You're not even trying!

418
00:25:48.256 --> 00:25:51.384
- Today it's all about attack!
- [roars]

419
00:25:51.551 --> 00:25:54.303
Nadders are quick
and light on their feet.

420
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:57.348
Your job is to be quicker and lighter!

421
00:25:59.434 --> 00:26:01.728
I'm really beginning to question
your teaching methods!

422
00:26:01.894 --> 00:26:04.647
Look for its blind spot!
Every dragon has one.

423
00:26:04.814 --> 00:26:07.316
Find it, hide in it and strike!

424
00:26:07.483 --> 00:26:08.943
- [snarls]
- [groans] Ohh!

425
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:10.737
[Ruffnut] Do you ever bathe?

426
00:26:10.903 --> 00:26:13.531
If you don't like it,
then just get your own blind spot.

427
00:26:13.698 --> 00:26:15.908
- How about I give you one?
- [Nadder growls]

428
00:26:17.326 --> 00:26:20.204
Blind spot, yes.
Deaf spot, not so much.

429
00:26:20.371 --> 00:26:21.789
[chuckles]

430
00:26:21.956 --> 00:26:24.083
How would one
sneak up on a Night Fury?

431
00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:27.795
No one's ever met one and lived
to tell the tale. Get in there!

432
00:26:27.962 --> 00:26:30.298
- I know, I know, but hypothetically...
- [Astrid] Hiccup!

433
00:26:30.465 --> 00:26:31.924
Get down.

434
00:26:33.384 --> 00:26:34.802
[growling]

435
00:26:41.267 --> 00:26:42.477

[roars]

437
00:26:45.938 --> 00:26:47.315
Watch out, babe.
I'll take care of this.

438
00:26:49.692 --> 00:26:52.069
- The sun was in my eyes, Astrid.
- [Nadder roars]

439
00:26:52.236 --> 00:26:54.405
What do you want me to do,
block the sun?

440
00:26:54.572 --> 00:26:56.199
I could do that
but I don't have time!

441
00:26:56.365 --> 00:26:58.117
[Hiccup] They probably...

442
00:26:58.284 --> 00:27:01.704
...take the daytime off,
right? Like a cat.

443
00:27:02.246 --> 00:27:05.416
- Has anyone ever seen one napping?
- Hiccup!

444
00:27:07.585 --> 00:27:08.711
Hiccup!

445
00:27:11.297 --> 00:27:13.716
Ooh! Love on the battlefield.

446
00:27:13.883 --> 00:27:17.303
- [Ruffnut] She could do better.
- Let me... Why don't you...? Aaah!

447
00:27:19.472 --> 00:27:20.973
Ow! Ow! Ow!

448
00:27:25.895 --> 00:27:27.855
- [panting]
- [Gobber] Well done, Astrid.

449
00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.984
Is this some kind of a joke to you?

450
00:27:32.527 --> 00:27:35.613
Our parents' war
is about to become ours.

451
00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.782
Figure out which side you're on.

452
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:20.950

00:28:58.738 --> 00:29:00.615
[chuckles] Toothless.

460
00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:03.534
I could have sworn you had...

461
00:29:03.701 --> 00:29:05.286
[gasps]

462
00:29:06.913 --> 00:29:08.539
...teeth.

463
00:29:09.916 --> 00:29:11.125
Uh... [stammers]

464
00:29:12.001 --> 00:29:13.794
No, no, no.

465
00:29:13.961 --> 00:29:16.464
I... I don't have any more!

466
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:23.763
Ugh!

467
00:29:42.949 --> 00:29:44.659
[sighs]

468
00:29:46.577 --> 00:29:47.912
Uh...

469
00:29:49.538 --> 00:29:51.332
- Mmm!
- [low growl]

470
00:29:52.041 --> 00:29:53.292
Mm-hmm.

[snarls]

492
00:33:12.992 --> 00:33:17.246
[Gobber] And with one twist,
he took my hand and swallowed it whole!

493
00:33:17.413 --> 00:33:20.791
I saw the look on his face...
I was delicious.

494
00:33:20.958 --> 00:33:23.127
He must have passed the word,
because it wasn't a month

495
00:33:23.294 --> 00:33:25.421
before another one of them took my leg.

496
00:33:26.964 --> 00:33:29.675
Isn't it weird to think
your hand was inside a dragon?

497
00:33:29.842 --> 00:33:31.969
Like if your mind was still
in control of it,

498
00:33:32.136 --> 00:33:35.598
you could have killed the dragon
from inside by crushing his heart.

499
00:33:35.764 --> 00:33:40.811
I swear, I'm so angry. I'll avenge your
beautiful hand and your beautiful foot.

500
00:33:40.978 --> 00:33:44.732
I'll chop off the legs of every dragon
I fight, with my face.

501
00:33:44.899 --> 00:33:48.319
Mm-mmm, no. It's the wings
and tail you really want.

502
00:33:48.485 --> 00:33:51.071
If it can't fly, it can't get away.

503
00:33:51.238 --> 00:33:55.618
A downed dragon is a dead dragon.

504
00:33:55.784 --> 00:33:57.369
[yawns]

505
00:33:57.536 --> 00:34:00.372
All right, I'm off to bed.
You should be, too.

506
00:34:00.539 --> 00:34:03.834
Tomorrow we get to the big boys,
slowly but surely

507
00:34:04.001 --> 00:34:07.129
making our way up
to the Monstrous Nightmare.

508
00:34:07.296 --> 00:34:09.840
But who'll win the honour of killing it?

509
00:34:10.007 --> 00:34:12.927
It's gonna be me.
It's my destiny. See?

510
00:34:13.093 --> 00:34:15.596
[gasps] Your mom let you get a tattoo?

511
00:34:15.763 --> 00:34:17.723
[Tuffnut] It's not a tattoo,
it's a birthmark.

512
00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:19.558
[Ruffnut] OK, I've been stuck
with you since birth,

513
00:34:19.725 --> 00:34:21.310
and that was never there before.

514
00:34:21.477 --> 00:34:24.563
[Tuffnut] Yes, it was. You've just
never seen me from the left side.

515
00:34:48.087 --> 00:34:49.338
[sizzles]

516
00:35:04.812 --> 00:35:07.523
[Hiccup] Hey, Toothless.

517
00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:12.069
I brought breakfast. I hope...
I hope you're hungry.

518
00:35:12.236 --> 00:35:14.989
OK, that's disgusting.

519
00:35:15.614 --> 00:35:18.575
We've got some salmon,
some nice Icelandic cod...

520
00:35:18.742 --> 00:35:20.577
...and a whole smoked eel.

521
00:35:20.744 --> 00:35:22.079
[snarls]

522
00:35:25.374 --> 00:35:28.794
- [roars]
- No, no, no, no, no! It's OK.

523
00:35:30.004 --> 00:35:32.047
Yeah, I don't really
like eel much, either.

524
00:35:35.426 --> 00:35:36.885
OK, that's it.

525
00:35:37.052 --> 00:35:40.055
That's it. Just stick
with the good stuff.

526
00:35:40.222 --> 00:35:43.517
And don't you mind me.
I'll just be back here,

527
00:35:43.684 --> 00:35:46.895
minding my own business.

528
00:35:56.071 --> 00:35:57.364
- [grunts]
- [Toothless growls]

529
00:35:58.574 --> 00:36:00.659
[gasps] It's OK.

530
00:36:00.826 --> 00:36:02.077
[grunting]

531
00:36:10.294 --> 00:36:12.087
OK.

532
00:36:15.049 --> 00:36:17.176
[guttural growl]

533
00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:27.728
That's not too bad. It works.

534
00:36:28.854 --> 00:36:31.148
Whoa! Whooaa!

535
00:36:33.233 --> 00:36:34.902
No, no, no, no!

536
00:36:39.073 --> 00:36:40.616
Whoa!

537
00:36:45.746 --> 00:36:47.414
Oh, my...! It's working!

538
00:36:54.088 --> 00:36:55.923
Yes, yes! I did it!

539
00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.594
Aaah!

540
00:37:01.345 --> 00:37:02.721
[shrieks]

541
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:11.230
- [Hiccup] Yeah!
<i>- [Gobber] Today is about teamwork.</i>

542
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:17.361
Now, a wet dragon head
can't light its fire.

543
00:37:17.528 --> 00:37:21.698
The Hideous Zippleback
is extra tricky.

544
00:37:21.865 --> 00:37:26.120
One head breathes gas,
the other head lights it.

545
00:37:26.286 --> 00:37:29.206
Your job is to know which is which.

546
00:37:29.373 --> 00:37:32.918
Razor-sharp serrated teeth
that inject venom for pre-digestion.

547
00:37:33.085 --> 00:37:35.170
Prefers ambush attack,
crushing its victims...

548
00:37:35.337 --> 00:37:36.547
Will you please stop that?!

549
00:37:36.713 --> 00:37:38.715
[dragon, gurgling]

550
00:37:41.009 --> 00:37:44.721
If that dragon shows either
of his faces, I'm gonna...

551
00:37:44.888 --> 00:37:46.181
There!

552
00:37:46.348 --> 00:37:49.560
Hey, it's us, idiots!

553
00:37:49.726 --> 00:37:52.396
Your butts are getting bigger.
We thought you were a dragon.

554
00:37:52.563 --> 00:37:55.816
Not that there's anything wrong
with a dragonesque figure... Ow!

555
00:37:58.068 --> 00:38:00.654
- [shouting]
- Wait.

556
00:38:00.821 --> 00:38:02.698
- [Tuffnut yelling]
- [dragon shrieks]

557
00:38:02.865 --> 00:38:06.368
Oh, I'm hurt!
I am very much hurt!

558
00:38:06.535 --> 00:38:09.079
Chances of survival are
dwindling to single digits now.

559
00:38:09.246 --> 00:38:11.081
[gurgles, sniffs]

560
00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.376
Whoa, whoa! [stammering]

561
00:38:15.627 --> 00:38:17.713
Oh. Heh! Wrong head.

562
00:38:18.672 --> 00:38:20.841
- Fishlegs!
- [screaming]

563
00:38:21.008 --> 00:38:23.844
- [gurgles, sparking]
- [Gobber] Now, Hiccup!

564
00:38:26.889 --> 00:38:28.515
Oh, come on.

565
00:38:28.682 --> 00:38:31.685
[snarling, roars]

566
00:38:33.437 --> 00:38:35.230
- Hiccup!
- [dragon shrieks]

567
00:38:36.315 --> 00:38:39.151
Back, back, back!

568
00:38:39.693 --> 00:38:43.489
Now, don't you make me
tell you again! Yes, that's right.

569
00:38:43.655 --> 00:38:47.826
Back into your cage.
Now think about what you've done.

570
00:38:52.915 --> 00:38:54.791
[growling, muffled]

571
00:38:57.878 --> 00:38:59.838
OK, so are we done?

572
00:39:00.005 --> 00:39:03.008
'Cause I've got some things I need to...

573
00:39:03.175 --> 00:39:05.928
Yep, I'll see you tomorrow!

574
00:39:15.854 --> 00:39:18.607
- [growls]
- Hey!

575
00:39:18.774 --> 00:39:20.067
[growls]

576
00:39:28.116 --> 00:39:30.494

00:39:44.132 --> 00:39:46.134
- [dragon snarls]
- [Snotlout] Whoa!

579
00:39:49.179 --> 00:39:51.056
[sniffing]

580
00:39:57.938 --> 00:40:00.190
I've never seen a Gronckle do that.

581
00:40:00.357 --> 00:40:01.817
I left my axe back in the ring.

582
00:40:01.984 --> 00:40:04.778
You guys go on ahead.
I'll catch up with you.

583
00:40:06.405 --> 00:40:08.365
[guttural growls]

584
00:40:11.493 --> 00:40:12.911

[Astrid yells]

587
00:40:34.725 --> 00:40:37.352
[clamouring]

588
00:40:44.651 --> 00:40:46.903
[Gobber] Meet the Terrible Terror.

589
00:40:48.697 --> 00:40:50.449
[scoffs] It's like the size of my...

590
00:40:50.616 --> 00:40:53.493
- [crowd groans]
- [Tuffnut] Get it off! [groans]

591
00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:56.455
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!

592
00:40:58.165 --> 00:41:01.293
- [grunts]
- Wow! He's better than you ever were.

593

[purrs, growls]

596
00:41:46.338 --> 00:41:47.839
[Hiccup] Oh, great.

597
00:41:48.799 --> 00:41:49.966
Hiccup.

598
00:42:02.396 --> 00:42:03.897
[metal clatters]

599
00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.401
[Astrid] Hiccup? Are you in there?

600
00:42:09.027 --> 00:42:10.654
Astrid. Hey.

601
00:42:10.821 --> 00:42:13.407
Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid.

602
00:42:13.573 --> 00:42:16.410
I normally don't care what people do,
but you're acting weird.

603
00:42:16.576 --> 00:42:19.413
- Ohh! [nervous chuckle]
- Well, weirder.

604
00:42:28.171 --> 00:42:30.257
- [sea birds cawing]
- [Vikings moaning]

605
00:42:48.191 --> 00:42:49.901
I trust you found the nest, at least?

606
00:42:50.068 --> 00:42:51.486
Not even close.

607
00:42:51.653 --> 00:42:52.904
Oh. Excellent.

608
00:42:53.071 --> 00:42:55.282
I hope you had more success than me.

609
00:42:55.449 --> 00:42:59.745
If by success, you mean
your parenting troubles are over, yes.

610
00:42:59.911 --> 00:43:03.749
Congratulations, Stoick!
Everyone is so relieved!

611
00:43:03.915 --> 00:43:05.584
Out with the old
and in with the new, right?

612
00:43:05.751 --> 00:43:09.045
- No one will miss that nuisance!
- We're throwing a party to celebrate!

613
00:43:09.212 --> 00:43:10.964
- Come over here.
- Hurry!

614
00:43:11.131 --> 00:43:12.966
He's gone?

615
00:43:13.133 --> 00:43:16.511
Yeah. Most afternoons,
but who can blame him?

616
00:43:16.678 --> 00:43:18.472
The life of a celebrity
is very rough.

617
00:43:18.638 --> 00:43:22.392
He can barely walk through the village
without being swarmed by his new fans.

618
00:43:22.559 --> 00:43:24.728
- Hiccup?
- Who would have thought it, eh?

619
00:43:24.895 --> 00:43:27.439
He has this way with the beasts.

620
00:43:35.697 --> 00:43:39.326
OK, bud. We're gonna
take this nice and slow.

621
00:43:39.493 --> 00:43:41.203
Here we go. Here we go.
Position...

622
00:43:41.369 --> 00:43:43.580
...three... no, four.

623
00:44:03.183 --> 00:44:05.393
All right, it's go time.
It's go time.

[Toothless growls]

625

Come on, buddy! Come on, buddy!

626
00:44:21.618 --> 00:44:23.161
Yes, it worked!

627
00:44:27.082 --> 00:44:29.000
- [growls]
- Sorry!

628
00:44:30.919 --> 00:44:32.879
- [growls]
- It was my fault.

629
00:44:34.339 --> 00:44:37.676
Yeah, I'm on it.
Position four. Uh, three.

630
00:44:41.263 --> 00:44:43.139
Yeah! Go, baby!

631
00:44:43.306 --> 00:44:44.850
Yes!

632
00:44:45.016 --> 00:44:46.852
Oh, this is amazing!

633
00:44:47.018 --> 00:44:50.063
The wind in my... cheat sheet!
Stop!

634
00:44:53.692 --> 00:44:55.277
- No!
- [roars]

635
00:44:57.946 --> 00:45:01.575
Oh, gosh! Oh, gods! Oh, no!

636
00:45:01.741 --> 00:45:04.494
All right, OK, you've gotta
kind of angle yourself.

637
00:45:04.661 --> 00:45:08.164
OK, no, no, no. Come back down
towards me! Come back down... Ow!

638
00:45:13.962 --> 00:45:15.297
[roars]

00:45:49.706 --> 00:45:51.666
Yeah!

641
00:45:53.126 --> 00:45:54.836
Oh, come on.

642
00:45:57.672 --> 00:45:59.507
[Toothless chomping]

643
00:46:02.093 --> 00:46:04.888
Uh... No, thanks. I'm good.

Huh. Not so fireproof
on the inside, are you?

652
00:46:45.512 --> 00:46:46.930
Here you go.

[purring]

654
00:47:03.238 --> 00:47:06.992
Everything we know
about you guys is wrong.

[footsteps approach]

656
00:47:17.502 --> 00:47:19.045
Dad! You're back!

657
00:47:19.212 --> 00:47:21.673
- Uh, Gobber's not here so...
- [Stoick] I know.

658
00:47:23.216 --> 00:47:25.510
I came looking for you.

659
00:47:25.677 --> 00:47:26.928
You did?

660
00:47:27.095 --> 00:47:28.722
You've been keeping secrets.

661
00:47:28.888 --> 00:47:30.473
[stammers] I have?

662
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.851
Just how long did you think
you could hide it?

663
00:47:33.018 --> 00:47:36.146
I... I...
I don't know what you're...

664
00:47:36.312 --> 00:47:40.275
Nothing happens on this island
without me hearing about it.

665
00:47:40.442 --> 00:47:42.610
- Oh?
- So...

666
00:47:43.319 --> 00:47:44.821
...let's talk...

667
00:47:44.988 --> 00:47:46.448
...about that dragon.

668
00:47:46.614 --> 00:47:49.034
Oh, gods.

669
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.870
Dad, I'm so sorry.
I... I was going to tell you.

670
00:47:52.037 --> 00:47:54.414
- I just didn't know how to...
- [chuckling]

671

- [laughing]
- [nervous laughter]

672
00:47:59.085 --> 00:48:01.379
You're... You're not upset?

673
00:48:01.546 --> 00:48:03.965
What?! I was hoping for this!

674
00:48:04.132 --> 00:48:05.467
Uh... You were?

675
00:48:05.633 --> 00:48:07.802
And believe me,
it only gets better!

676
00:48:07.969 --> 00:48:10.638
Wait till you spill
a Nadder's guts the first time!

677
00:48:10.805 --> 00:48:13.433
And mount your first
Gronckle head on a spear!

678
00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:17.395
What a feeling!
You really had me going there, son!

679
00:48:17.562 --> 00:48:21.733
All those years of the worst Viking
Berk has ever seen.

680
00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:25.445
Odin, it was rough.
I almost gave up on you.

681
00:48:25.612 --> 00:48:27.822
And all the while
you were holding out on me!

682
00:48:27.989 --> 00:48:31.076
Oh, Thor Almighty! [sighs]

683
00:48:31.242 --> 00:48:33.620
With you doing so well in the ring...

684
00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:37.832
...we finally have
something to talk about.

685
00:48:50.303 --> 00:48:51.888
Oh.

686
00:48:52.055 --> 00:48:54.849
Here, I, uh, I brought you something,

687
00:48:55.016 --> 00:48:58.186
to keep you safe in the ring.

688
00:48:58.353 --> 00:49:00.396
Wow. Thanks.

689
00:49:00.563 --> 00:49:02.857
Your mother would have
wanted you to have it.

690
00:49:03.024 --> 00:49:06.861
- It's half of her breastplate.
- [nervous chuckle]

691
00:49:07.028 --> 00:49:10.782
Matching set.
It keeps her close, you know.

692
00:49:11.783 --> 00:49:14.327
Wear it proudly. You deserve it.

693
00:49:14.494 --> 00:49:16.579
You've held up your end of the deal.

694
00:49:21.584 --> 00:49:24.712
[yawns] I should really get to bed.

695
00:49:24.879 --> 00:49:27.048
Yes, good. OK, good talk.

696
00:49:27.215 --> 00:49:29.134
I'll see you back at the house.

697
00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:30.718
Thanks for stopping by...

698
00:49:30.885 --> 00:49:33.555
- ...and for the breast hat.
- I hope you like the hat.

699
00:49:33.721 --> 00:49:35.223
[clears throat]

700
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:37.684
Well, uh... Yep. Good night.

701
00:49:39.686 --> 00:49:42.480
- [sighs]
- [exhales]

702
00:49:47.193 --> 00:49:49.237
[cheering]

703
00:49:52.782 --> 00:49:55.243
Stay out of my way!
I'm winning this thing.

704
00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:58.079
Please, by all means.

705
00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:00.915
[dragon growls]

706
00:50:10.466 --> 00:50:12.635
This time, this time for sure!

707
00:50:14.053 --> 00:50:16.139
[screams]

708
00:50:17.515 --> 00:50:19.976
- [snoring]
- [crowd cheering]

709
00:50:21.144 --> 00:50:24.189
No! No, son of a half-troll,

710
00:50:24.355 --> 00:50:27.275
- rat-eating, munge-bucket!
- Wait! Wait.

711
00:50:27.442 --> 00:50:29.652
- So, later.
- Oh! Not so fast.

712
00:50:29.819 --> 00:50:31.654
- I'm kind of late for...
- What?!

713
00:50:31.821 --> 00:50:34.199
Late for what, exactly?

714
00:50:34.365 --> 00:50:37.202
Quiet down! The elder has decided.

715
00:50:40.163 --> 00:50:42.832
[crowd gasps, murmurs]

716
00:50:45.919 --> 00:50:48.504
[crowd cheering]

717
00:50:48.671 --> 00:50:52.300
You've done it, Hiccup!
You get to kill the dragon!

718
00:50:52.467 --> 00:50:54.594
- [cheering]
- Yeah!

719
00:50:56.137 --> 00:50:57.347
That's my boy!

720
00:50:57.513 --> 00:51:01.184
Yeah. Yes. I can't wait. I am so...

721
00:51:01.351 --> 00:51:03.311
...leaving! We're leaving.

722
00:51:03.478 --> 00:51:05.230
Let's pack up.

723
00:51:05.396 --> 00:51:08.107
Looks like you and me are
taking a little vacation.

724
00:51:08.274 --> 00:51:09.984
Forever.

725
00:51:12.528 --> 00:51:14.239
[sighs] Oh, man.

726
00:51:15.907 --> 00:51:18.993
[gasps] What the...?!
[stammers] What are you doing here?

727
00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.329
I want to know what's going on.

728
00:51:22.413 --> 00:51:26.542
No one just gets as good as you do.
Especially you.

729
00:51:26.709 --> 00:51:29.837
Start talking!
Are you training with someone?

730
00:51:30.004 --> 00:51:32.548
- Training? [stammers]
- It better not involve this.

731
00:51:32.715 --> 00:51:35.510
I know this looks really bad,
but you see...

732
00:51:35.677 --> 00:51:37.512
- [twig snaps]
- This is, uh... Aaah!

733
00:51:38.972 --> 00:51:41.140
You're right. You're right.
You're right.

734
00:51:41.307 --> 00:51:42.934
I'm through with the lies.

735
00:51:43.101 --> 00:51:46.145
I've been making outfits.
So you got me.

736
00:51:46.312 --> 00:51:49.107
It's time everyone knew.
Drag me back, go ahead.

737
00:51:49.274 --> 00:51:52.610
Here we go... Ow!
Why would you do that?!

738
00:51:52.777 --> 00:51:56.823
That's for the lies.
And that's for everything else.

739
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:58.908
- [Toothless roars]
- [Hiccup] Oh, man.

740
00:51:59.826 --> 00:52:01.035
[gasps] Get down!

741
00:52:01.202 --> 00:52:04.289
- [roars]
- Run, run!

742
00:52:05.456 --> 00:52:09.127
No! It's OK! It's OK.

743
00:52:09.294 --> 00:52:10.586
She's a friend.

744
00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:14.215
You just scared him.

745
00:52:14.382 --> 00:52:16.843
- I scared him?!
- [Toothless growls]

746
00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:19.595
- Who is "him?"
- Uh...

747
00:52:19.762 --> 00:52:23.308
Astrid, Toothless.
Toothless, Astrid.

748
00:52:23.474 --> 00:52:25.310
[snarls]

749
00:52:28.479 --> 00:52:30.606
[mimics fanfare] We're dead.

750
00:52:31.774 --> 00:52:34.068
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where do you think you're going?

751
00:52:34.235 --> 00:52:35.653
[panting]

752
00:52:40.158 --> 00:52:43.119
Oh, great Odin's ghost!
Oh, this is it!

753
00:52:52.378 --> 00:52:53.963
[panting]

754
00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:56.299
Hiccup, get me down from here!

755
00:52:56.466 --> 00:52:58.593
You have to give me a chance to explain.

756
00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:01.429
I am not listening
to anything you have to say!

757
00:53:01.596 --> 00:53:05.016
Then I won't speak.
Just let me show you.

758
00:53:06.267 --> 00:53:07.977
Please, Astrid.

759
00:53:08.603 --> 00:53:10.605
- [grunts]
- [branches creak]

760
00:53:14.734 --> 00:53:16.736
[growls]

761
00:53:23.993 --> 00:53:25.036
Now get me down.

762
00:53:25.203 --> 00:53:28.122
Toothless, down. Gently.

763
00:53:29.665 --> 00:53:32.085
See? Nothing to be afraid of.

764
00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:35.296
Whaaah!

765
00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.173
Toothless!

766
00:53:38.216 --> 00:53:40.676
What is wrong with you?! Bad dragon!

767
00:53:40.843 --> 00:53:44.514
[nervous laugh] He's not
usually like this.

768
00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:47.100
- Oh, no.
- [screaming]

769
00:53:50.895 --> 00:53:53.606
Toothless, what are you doing?
We need her to like us!

770
00:53:57.151 --> 00:53:59.737
- And now the spinning.
- [Astrid screaming]

771
00:53:59.904 --> 00:54:02.698
Thank you for nothing,
you useless reptile.

772
00:54:03.783 --> 00:54:06.953
OK, I am sorry! I'm sorry.

773
00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.746
Just get me off this thing.

774
00:55:55.478 --> 00:55:58.856
All right, I admit it.
This is pretty cool.

775
00:55:59.690 --> 00:56:01.526
It's amazing.

776
00:56:02.485 --> 00:56:03.986
He's amazing.

777
00:56:06.614 --> 00:56:08.366
So what now?

778
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:12.036
Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow.

779
00:56:12.203 --> 00:56:13.996
You know you'll have to kill...

780
00:56:14.163 --> 00:56:16.082
- [dragon growls, faint]
- ...kill a dragon.

781
00:56:16.249 --> 00:56:18.376
- Don't remind me.
- [both scream]

782
00:56:18.543 --> 00:56:20.253
[Hiccup] Toothless, what's happening?

783
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:26.676
- Whoa! What is it?
- [dragons roaring]

784
00:56:26.842 --> 00:56:27.969
Get down!

785
00:56:31.222 --> 00:56:33.015
[roaring]

786
00:56:45.236 --> 00:56:46.946
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

787
00:56:47.113 --> 00:56:49.031
Toothless, you got to
get us out of here, bud.

788
00:56:49.198 --> 00:56:50.241
[snarls]

789
00:56:52.702 --> 00:56:55.162
[Hiccup] It looks like
they're hauling in their kill.

790
00:56:55.329 --> 00:56:57.540
Uh... what does that make us?

791
00:57:18.603 --> 00:57:20.896
[dragons snarling, roaring]

792
00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:43.377
What my dad wouldn't give to find this.

793
00:58:00.186 --> 00:58:03.564
It's satisfying to know all our food
has been dumped down a hole.

794
00:58:03.731 --> 00:58:06.442
- [dragon shrieks]
- They're not eating any of it.

795
00:58:12.114 --> 00:58:13.324
[shudders]

796
00:58:19.538 --> 00:58:21.123
[growling]

797
00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:23.668
- [gasps]
- What is that?

798
00:58:23.834 --> 00:58:25.878
[roars]

799
00:58:30.883 --> 00:58:33.928
All right, bud, we got
to get out of here... now!

800
00:58:42.812 --> 00:58:46.982
[Astrid] No, it totally makes sense.
It's like a giant beehive.

801
00:58:47.149 --> 00:58:49.193
They're the workers
and that's their queen.

802
00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:51.946
It controls them.
Let's find your dad.

803
00:58:52.113 --> 00:58:53.280
No! No.

804
00:58:54.156 --> 00:58:57.201
No, not yet.
They'll kill Toothless.

805
00:58:57.368 --> 00:59:00.454
We have to think this
through carefully.

806
00:59:00.621 --> 00:59:03.708
Hiccup, we just discovered
the dragons' nest,

807
00:59:03.874 --> 00:59:06.794
the thing we've been after
since Vikings first sailed here,

808
00:59:06.961 --> 00:59:08.671
and you want to keep it a secret?

809
00:59:08.838 --> 00:59:12.133
To protect your pet dragon?
Are you serious?

810
00:59:14.051 --> 00:59:15.511
Yes.

811
00:59:22.977 --> 00:59:25.521
OK. Then what do we do?

812
00:59:25.688 --> 00:59:29.442
Just give me until tomorrow.
I'll figure something out.

813
00:59:29.608 --> 00:59:31.569
OK.

814
00:59:32.862 --> 00:59:34.280
That's for kidnapping me.

815
00:59:35.072 --> 00:59:36.490
[growls]

816
00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:43.372
That's for everything else.

817
00:59:52.923 --> 00:59:54.884
What are you looking at?

818
00:59:55.801 --> 00:59:58.262
[crowd] Hiccup! Hiccup!
Hiccup! Hiccup!

819
01:00:02.767 --> 01:00:05.728
Well, I can show my face
in public again! [laughs]

820
01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:10.983
If someone had told me
that in a few short weeks

821
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:13.652
Hiccup would go from, well,

822
01:00:13.819 --> 01:00:16.030
being, uh, Hiccup

823
01:00:16.197 --> 01:00:19.033
to placing first in dragon training,

824
01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:23.621
I'd have tied him to a mast and
shipped him off for fear he'd gone mad!

825
01:00:23.788 --> 01:00:26.957
- [cheering]
- And you know it! [laughs]

826
01:00:27.124 --> 01:00:31.837
But here we are.
And no one is more surprised

827
01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.090
or more proud than I am.

828
01:00:36.467 --> 01:00:39.345
Today, my boy becomes a Viking.

829
01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:43.849
- Today, he becomes one of us!
- [crowd cheers]

830
01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.687
Be careful with that dragon.

831
01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:51.273
It's not the dragon
I'm worried about.

832
01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:55.486
- [Astrid] What are you going to do?
- Put an end to this. I have to try.

833
01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:59.782
Astrid, if something goes wrong,

834
01:00:59.949 --> 01:01:02.159
just make sure they
don't find Toothless.

835
01:01:02.326 --> 01:01:06.372
I will. Just promise me
it won't go wrong.

836
01:01:06.539 --> 01:01:10.668
It's time, Hiccup.
Knock 'em dead.

837
01:01:10.835 --> 01:01:12.878
[crowd chanting, applause]

838
01:01:15.923 --> 01:01:18.467
Yeah! Show 'em how it's done.

839
01:01:18.634 --> 01:01:21.887
Hiccup! Hiccup!
Hiccup! Hiccup!

840
01:01:33.858 --> 01:01:35.943
Hmm, I'd have gone for the hammer.

841
01:01:38.237 --> 01:01:39.905
[deep breath, exhales]

842
01:01:40.072 --> 01:01:41.156
I'm ready.

843
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:48.372
- [shrieking]
- [crowd gasps]

844
01:01:49.248 --> 01:01:50.708
[growling]

845
01:02:05.306 --> 01:02:08.058
[man] Go on, Hiccup. Give it to him!

846
01:02:12.521 --> 01:02:13.606
What is he doing?

847
01:02:13.772 --> 01:02:15.024
[murmuring]

848
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:18.777
Hey, it's OK. It's OK.

849
01:02:26.994 --> 01:02:29.163
I'm not one of them.

850
01:02:32.541 --> 01:02:34.418
- [gasps]
- What's he thinking?

851
01:02:34.585 --> 01:02:36.503
- Stop the fight.
- [Hiccup] No!

852
01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:38.839
I need you all to see this.

853
01:02:39.924 --> 01:02:42.426
They're not what we think they are.

854
01:02:42.593 --> 01:02:44.553
We don't have to kill them.

855
01:02:46.263 --> 01:02:48.223
I said, stop the fight!

856
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:50.017
- [crowd gasps]
- Aaah!

857
01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:57.024
Out of my way!

858
01:02:57.191 --> 01:02:58.233
Hiccup!

859
01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.530
[growling]

860
01:03:08.327 --> 01:03:09.370
Aaah!

861
01:03:18.963 --> 01:03:20.005
Hiccup!

862
01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:25.511
[growls]

863
01:03:27.471 --> 01:03:29.223
This way!

864
01:03:34.979 --> 01:03:37.314
- [snarling]
- [Toothless divebombs]

865
01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:39.024
[shrieks]

866
01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:43.612
[clamouring]

867
01:03:48.951 --> 01:03:50.077
Night Fury!

868
01:04:04.008 --> 01:04:05.843
[roars]

869
01:04:08.762 --> 01:04:10.472
All right, Toothless, go.
Get out of here.

870
01:04:12.391 --> 01:04:15.102
- Go, go!
- [Astrid] Stoick, no!

871
01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:16.562
- Dad, he won't hurt you!
- [growls]

872
01:04:17.646 --> 01:04:20.149
No, don't! You're only making it worse!

873
01:04:21.859 --> 01:04:23.527
Toothless, stop!

874
01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:25.946
No! No!

875
01:04:28.115 --> 01:04:29.867
- [moans]
- [panting]

876
01:04:30.034 --> 01:04:31.118
[man] Get him!

877
01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:36.623
No, no! Please don't hurt him!

878
01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:38.000
Please don't hurt him.

879
01:04:38.167 --> 01:04:39.710
[grunting]

880
01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:47.217
Put it with the others.

881
01:04:50.054 --> 01:04:52.514
I should have known.
I should have seen the signs.

882
01:04:52.681 --> 01:04:54.558
- Dad?
- We had a deal!

883
01:04:54.725 --> 01:04:58.729
I know we did. That was before...
Aw, it's all so messed up.

884
01:04:58.896 --> 01:05:02.316
So everything in the ring, a trick?
A lie?

885
01:05:02.483 --> 01:05:06.153
I screwed up. I should have
told you before now. I just...

886
01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:10.324
Take this out on me, be mad at me,
but please, just don't hurt Toothless.

887
01:05:10.491 --> 01:05:13.535
The dragon? That's what
you're worried about?

888
01:05:13.702 --> 01:05:15.537
Not the people you almost killed?

889
01:05:15.704 --> 01:05:18.123
He was protecting me!
He's not dangerous.

890
01:05:18.290 --> 01:05:20.292
They've killed hundreds of us!

891
01:05:20.459 --> 01:05:22.127
And we've killed thousands of them!

892
01:05:22.294 --> 01:05:24.797
They defend themselves, that's all!

893
01:05:24.963 --> 01:05:27.591
They raid us because they have to.

894
01:05:27.758 --> 01:05:31.637
If they don't bring enough food back,
they're eaten themselves.

895
01:05:31.804 --> 01:05:36.100
There's something else on their island.
It's a dragon like...

896
01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:38.977
Their island?
So you've been to the nest?

897
01:05:39.144 --> 01:05:40.938
- Did I say nest?
- How did you find it?

898
01:05:41.105 --> 01:05:43.649
What? No, I didn't. Toothless did.

899
01:05:43.816 --> 01:05:46.276
Only a dragon can find the island.

900
01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:50.948
No, no, no. No, Dad. No, please,
it's not what you think.

901
01:05:51.115 --> 01:05:55.452
You don't know what you're up against.
It's like nothing you've ever seen.

902
01:05:55.619 --> 01:05:58.038
Dad, please. I promise you,
you can't win this one!

903
01:05:58.205 --> 01:06:00.624
No, Dad. No.

904
01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:03.544
For once in your life,
would you please just listen to me?!

905
01:06:06.588 --> 01:06:11.093
You've thrown your lot in with them.
You're not a Viking.

906
01:06:13.345 --> 01:06:15.305
You're not my son.

907
01:06:18.517 --> 01:06:19.852
Ready the ships!

908
01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:33.073
[man] This way.

909
01:06:54.553 --> 01:06:56.221
[growls]

910
01:06:58.765 --> 01:07:00.100
[Toothless growling]

911
01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.197
[roaring]

912
01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:17.075
Set sail!

913
01:07:17.242 --> 01:07:19.203
We head for Helheim's Gate.

914
01:07:28.086 --> 01:07:30.214
Lead us home, devil.

915
01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:52.986
It's a mess.

916
01:07:54.238 --> 01:07:57.574
You must feel horrible.
You've lost everything:

917
01:07:57.741 --> 01:08:00.744
your father, your tribe,
your best friend.

918
01:08:00.911 --> 01:08:02.871
Thank you for summing that up.

919
01:08:04.206 --> 01:08:06.250
Why couldn't I have killed that dragon

920
01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:08.085
when I found him in the woods?

921
01:08:08.252 --> 01:08:10.003
Would have been better for everyone.

922
01:08:10.170 --> 01:08:12.047
Yep. The rest of us would've done it.

923
01:08:13.173 --> 01:08:15.133
So why didn't you?

924
01:08:18.095 --> 01:08:19.429
Why didn't you?

925
01:08:19.596 --> 01:08:20.889
I don't know.

926
01:08:21.056 --> 01:08:23.642
- I couldn't.
- That's not an answer.

927
01:08:23.809 --> 01:08:26.144
Why is this so important to you
all of a sudden?

928
01:08:26.311 --> 01:08:29.564
Because I want to remember
what you say right now.

929
01:08:29.731 --> 01:08:31.942
Oh, for the love of...
I was a coward.

930
01:08:32.109 --> 01:08:34.736
I was weak. I wouldn't kill a dragon.

931
01:08:34.903 --> 01:08:38.365
- You said "wouldn't" that time.
- Whatever! I wouldn't!

932
01:08:38.532 --> 01:08:42.369
Three hundred years, and I'm the first
Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon.

933
01:08:47.249 --> 01:08:49.001
First to ride one, though.

934
01:08:51.503 --> 01:08:52.546
So...?

935
01:08:55.507 --> 01:08:58.760
I wouldn't kill him because
he looked as frightened as I was.

936
01:08:58.927 --> 01:09:03.432
I looked at him and I saw myself.

937
01:09:05.309 --> 01:09:07.561
I bet he's really frightened now.

938
01:09:08.145 --> 01:09:09.896
What are you going to do about it?

939
01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:13.942
Eh, probably something stupid.

940
01:09:14.109 --> 01:09:15.944
Good, but you've already done that.

941
01:09:17.612 --> 01:09:19.364
Then something crazy.

942
01:09:20.407 --> 01:09:22.200
That's more like it.

943
01:09:31.168 --> 01:09:34.379
[Stoick] Sound your positions.
Stay within earshot.

944
01:09:34.546 --> 01:09:36.631
- [man] Here!
- [man 2] One length to your stern.

945
01:09:36.798 --> 01:09:42.304
Stoick, I was overhearing some of the
men just now, and, well, some of them

946
01:09:42.471 --> 01:09:46.099
are wondering what it is
we're up to here. Not me, of course.

947
01:09:46.266 --> 01:09:48.810
I know you're always the man
with the plan. But some, not me,

948
01:09:48.977 --> 01:09:51.980
are wondering if there is,
in fact, a plan at all

949
01:09:52.147 --> 01:09:54.566
and what it might be.

950
01:09:54.733 --> 01:09:56.151
Find the nest and take it.

951
01:09:56.318 --> 01:09:58.570
Oh, of course.
Send them running.

952
01:09:58.737 --> 01:10:00.655
The old Viking fallback.
Nice and simple.

953
01:10:00.822 --> 01:10:02.032
- [gurgling]
- Shh, shh!

954
01:10:02.199 --> 01:10:03.950
[gurgling]

955
01:10:10.624 --> 01:10:12.167
Step aside.

956
01:10:25.389 --> 01:10:27.432
Bear to port.

957
01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:35.440
If you're planning on getting eaten,
I'd definitely go with the Gronckle.

958
01:10:36.817 --> 01:10:40.695
You were wise to seek help
from the world's most deadly weapon.

959
01:10:40.862 --> 01:10:41.947
- Uh...
- It's me.

960
01:10:42.114 --> 01:10:44.658
- I love this plan.
- I didn't...

961
01:10:44.825 --> 01:10:47.369
You're crazy. [whispers] I like that.

962
01:10:47.536 --> 01:10:50.455
So, what is the plan?

963
01:11:00.841 --> 01:11:03.802
- That's not really encouraging.
- Oh.

964
01:11:03.969 --> 01:11:06.430
[chuckles] I was wondering
where that went.

965
01:11:10.308 --> 01:11:12.185
[chains rattle]

966
01:11:12.352 --> 01:11:13.854
[sniffing]

967
01:11:17.649 --> 01:11:21.695
- [clamour]
- Stay low and ready your weapons.

968
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:27.200
[growls, roars]

969
01:11:30.328 --> 01:11:32.456
[animal noises, distant]

970
01:11:38.003 --> 01:11:39.045
We're here.

971
01:11:41.965 --> 01:11:43.216
[animal noises stop]

972
01:11:49.389 --> 01:11:50.557
[exhales]

973
01:11:53.852 --> 01:11:55.604
- [gasps]
- Oh...

974
01:12:03.445 --> 01:12:04.821
Uh-uh.

975
01:12:12.245 --> 01:12:14.289
- Wait! What are you...?
- Shh! Relax.

976
01:12:14.456 --> 01:12:17.000
It's OK. It's OK.

977
01:12:20.795 --> 01:12:23.089
[guttural purr]

978
01:12:28.637 --> 01:12:29.679
Where are you going?

979
01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:32.390
You're gonna need something
to help you hold on.

980
01:12:41.566 --> 01:12:45.862
When we crack this mountain open,
all hell is going to break loose.

981
01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:48.740
In my undies.
Good thing I brought extras.

982
01:12:48.907 --> 01:12:52.035
No matter how this ends, it ends today.

983
01:12:58.416 --> 01:13:01.044
- [rumbling]
- [stone cracking]

984
01:13:04.589 --> 01:13:06.007
[Vikings cheering, distant]

985
01:13:18.103 --> 01:13:20.772
[dragons shrieking, growling]

986
01:13:24.067 --> 01:13:26.653
- [screams]
- [dragons roaring]

987
01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:43.837
[whimpering growl]

988
01:13:47.257 --> 01:13:49.050
Is that it?

989
01:13:53.597 --> 01:13:56.766
- [Gobber] We've done it!
- [cheering]

990
01:13:56.933 --> 01:13:59.227
[dragon roaring, muted]

991
01:14:03.898 --> 01:14:08.361
This isn't over!
Form your ranks! Hold together!

992
01:14:08.528 --> 01:14:11.781
- [rumbling]
- [cracking]

993
01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:13.867
[dragon roaring]

994
01:14:15.577 --> 01:14:17.746
[dragon snarling]

995
01:14:21.041 --> 01:14:23.126
- Get clear!
- [gasps]

996
01:14:23.293 --> 01:14:25.962
- [growling]
- [Vikings yelling]

997
01:14:32.552 --> 01:14:35.055
Beard of Thor! What is that?!

998
01:14:39.142 --> 01:14:41.019
Odin help us.

999
01:14:41.186 --> 01:14:43.521
[roaring]

1000
01:14:45.774 --> 01:14:48.109
- Catapults!
- [man] Fire!

1001
01:14:56.701 --> 01:14:58.870
- Get to the ships!
- No! No!

1002
01:15:02.666 --> 01:15:04.167
[Vikings screaming]

1003
01:15:10.090 --> 01:15:11.216
[roars]

1004
01:15:11.383 --> 01:15:13.802
- Smart, that one.
- I was a fool.

1005
01:15:13.968 --> 01:15:15.845
Lead the men to the far side
of the island!

1006
01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:17.389
- Right!
- Gobber, go with the men!

1007
01:15:17.555 --> 01:15:20.350
I think I'll stay, in case you're
thinking of doing something crazy.

1008
01:15:20.517 --> 01:15:23.853
I can buy them a few minutes
if I give that thing someone to hunt!

1009
01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.689
Then I can double that time.

1010
01:15:28.358 --> 01:15:31.486
- Here!
- Oh, no! Here!

1011
01:15:40.537 --> 01:15:44.916
- [snarling]
- Come on! Fight me!

1012
01:15:45.083 --> 01:15:47.419
- No, me!
- [growls]

1013
01:15:51.131 --> 01:15:52.757
- [dragons roaring]
- [roars]

1014
01:15:53.633 --> 01:15:57.512
Ruff, Tuff! Watch your backs!
Move, Fishlegs!

1015
01:15:58.304 --> 01:16:02.225
[Tuffnut] Look at us! We're on a dragon.
We're on dragons! All of us!

1016
01:16:04.102 --> 01:16:06.438
[Hiccup] Up! Let's move it!

1017
01:16:06.604 --> 01:16:11.067
Every bit the boar-headed
stubborn Viking you ever were!

1018
01:16:12.777 --> 01:16:14.446
- Fishlegs, break it down!
- OK.

1019
01:16:14.612 --> 01:16:17.323
Heavily armoured skull and tail
made for bashing and crushing!

1020
01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:20.285
Steer clear of both.
Small eyes, large nostrils!

1021
01:16:20.452 --> 01:16:22.954
- Relies on hearing and smell!
- OK, Lout, Legs!

1022
01:16:23.121 --> 01:16:25.123
Hang in its blind spot,
keep it confused!

1023
01:16:25.290 --> 01:16:29.002
Ruff, Tuff, find out if it has
a shot limit! Make it mad!

1024
01:16:29.169 --> 01:16:31.087
- That's my specialty!
- Since when?!

1025
01:16:31.254 --> 01:16:34.048
Everyone knows
I'm more irritating! See?

1026
01:16:34.215 --> 01:16:37.761
Just do what I told you!
I'll be back as soon as I can!

1027
01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:39.429
Don't worry!
We got it covered!

1028
01:16:39.596 --> 01:16:41.806
- [Fishlegs] Yeah!
- [Ruffnut] Whoo!

1029
01:16:49.355 --> 01:16:51.316
- Troll! Bride of Grendel!
