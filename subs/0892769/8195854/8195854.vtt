00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:36.745
<i>This is Berk.</i>

2
00:00:36.912 --> 00:00:41.291
<i>It's twelve days north of hopeless and a
few degrees south of freezing to death.</i>

3
00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:45.212
<i>It's located solidly
on the meridian of misery.</i>

4
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:49.800
<i>My village. In a word, sturdy.</i>

5
00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:54.638
<i>It's been here for seven generations,
but every single building is new.</i>

6
00:00:54.805 --> 00:00:58.850
<i>We have fishing, hunting
and a charming view of the sunsets.</i>

7
00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:02.020
<i>The only problems are the pests.</i>

8
00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:06.441
<i>You see, most places
have mice or mosquitoes.</i>

9
00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:08.777
<i>We have...</i>

10
00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:13.073
...dragons.

11
00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:16.660
<i>Most people would leave. Not us.</i>

12
00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:20.455
<i>We're Vikings.
We have stubbornness issues.</i>

13
00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:23.625
<i>My name is Hiccup.</i>

14
00:01:24.543 --> 00:01:27.170
<i>Great name, I know.
But it's not the worst.</i>

15
00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:31.008
<i>Parents believe a hideous name
will frighten off gnomes and trolls.</i>

16
00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:33.510
<i>Like our charming Viking demeanor
wouldn't do that.</i>

17
00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:35.679
Morning!

18
00:01:37.848 --> 00:01:39.683
- What are you doing here?!
- Get inside!

19
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.644
- What are you doing out?!
- Get back inside!

20
00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:49.735
Hiccup! What is he doing...?
What are you doing out?! Get inside!

21
00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:53.530
<i>That's Stoick the Vast,
chief of the tribe.</i>

22
00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:58.535
<i>When he was a baby, he popped
a dragon's head clean of fits shoulders.</i>

23
00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:00.787
<i>Do I believe it? Yes, I do.</i>

24
00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:01.955
What have we got?

25
00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:05.917
Gronckles. Nadders. Zipplebacks.
Hoark saw a Monstrous Nightmare.

26
00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:09.504
- Any Night Furies?
- None so far.

27
00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:10.714
Good.

28
00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:12.716
Hoist the torches!

29
00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:21.558
Nice of you to join the party!
I thought you'd been carried off!

30
00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:26.563
Who, me? No, come on,
I'm way too muscular for their taste.

31
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.900
They wouldn't know
what to do with all this.

32
00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:31.902
They need toothpicks, don't they?

33
00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:36.281
<i>The meathead with attitude
and interchangeable hands is Gobber.</i>

34
00:02:36.448 --> 00:02:40.911
<i>I've been his apprentice
since I was little. Well, littler.</i>

35
00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:45.082
Move to the lower defenses.
We'll counterattack with the catapults.

36
00:02:45.248 --> 00:02:46.375
Hurry!

37
00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.754
<i>See? Old village,
lots and lots of new houses.</i>

38
00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:52.255
Fire!

39
00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:53.715
Let's go!

40
00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:58.470
<i>That's Fishlegs, Snotlout, the twins:
Ruff nut and Tuffnut...</i>

41
00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.222
<i>...and...</i>

42
00:03:01.932 --> 00:03:03.433
<i>...Astrid.</i>

43
00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:15.821
<i>Their job is so much cooler.</i>

44
00:03:16.947 --> 00:03:20.367
Come on. Let me out, please.
I need to make my mark.

45
00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:23.453
You've made plenty of marks,
all in the wrong places.

46
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.455
Please, two minutes. I'll kill a dragon.

47
00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:28.792
My life will get infinitely better.
I might even get a date.

48
00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.628
You can't lift a hammer.
You can't swing an axe.

49
00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:33.338
You can't even throw one of these!

50
00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:38.677
OK, fine,
but this will throw it for me.

51
00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:43.223
See? Now this right here
is what I'm talking about!

52
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.434
- Mild calibration issue...
- Hiccup!

53
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.645
If you ever want to get out there
to fight dragons...

54
00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:51.815
...you need to stop all this.

55
00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:54.067
But you just pointed to all of me.

56
00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:57.612
Yes, that's it!
Stop being all of you.

57
00:03:58.655 --> 00:03:59.781
Oh, yes.

58
00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:02.659
You, sir,
are playing a dangerous game.

59
00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:06.830
Keeping this much
raw Vikingness contained?

60
00:04:06.997 --> 00:04:08.665
There will be consequences!

61
00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:12.294
I'll take my chances.
Sword. Sharpen. Now.

62
00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:18.008
<i>One day, I'll get out there.
Because killing a dragon...</i>

63
00:04:18.175 --> 00:04:20.010
<i>...is everything around here.</i>

64
00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:24.681
<i>A Nadder head is sure
to get me at least noticed.</i>

65
00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:26.266
<i>Gronckles are tough.</i>

66
00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:29.686
<i>Taking down one of those
would definitely get me a girlfriend.</i>

67
00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:31.813
<i>A Zippleback?</i>

68
00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:35.776
<i>Exotic. Two heads, twice the status.</i>

69
00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.194
They found the sheep!

70
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.529
Concentrate fire over the lower bank.

71
00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:41.364
- Hurry up!
- Fire!

72
00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:44.701
<i>And then there's
the Monstrous Nightmare.</i>

73
00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:47.746
<i>Only the best Vikings go after those.</i>

74
00:04:47.913 --> 00:04:51.875
<i>They have this nasty habit
of setting themselves on fire.</i>

75
00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:56.213
Reload! I'll take care of this.

76
00:04:57.631 --> 00:05:01.718
<i>But the ultimate prize
is the dragon no one's ever seen.</i>

77
00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:03.887
<i>- We call it the...</i>
- Night Fury!

78
00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:05.388
Get down!

79
00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:09.893
Jump!

80
00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:14.439
<i>This thing never steals food,
never shows itself and...</i>

81
00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:17.692
<i>...never misses.</i>

82
00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:22.614
<i>No one has ever killed a Night Fury.
That's why I'm going to be the first.</i>

83
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:25.909
Man the fort, Hiccup.
They need me out there.

84
00:05:27.536 --> 00:05:30.288
Stay. Put. There.

85
00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:33.458
You know what I mean.

86
00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:37.087
- Where are you going?
- Yeah, I know!

87
00:05:37.254 --> 00:05:38.630
- Hiccup!
- Be right back!

88
00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:45.762
Let's get him!

89
00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:47.764
Mind yourselves!

90
00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:49.933
The devils still have
some juice in them!

91
00:05:59.985 --> 00:06:03.280
Come on. Give me something to
shoot at. Give me something to shoot at.

92
00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:28.638
I hit it. Yes, I hit it!

93
00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:30.849
Did anybody see that?

94
00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:33.518
Except for you.

95
00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:41.902
- Do not let them escape!
- Right!

96
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.339
You're all out.

97
00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:11.014
<i>Oh, and there's one more thing
you need to know.</i>

98
00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:23.485
Sorry, Dad.

99
00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:34.704
OK, but I hit a Night Fury.

100
00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:39.292
It's not like the last few times, Dad!
I really, actually hit it!

101
00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.711
You guys were busy.
I had a very clear shot.

102
00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:45.382
It went down off Raven Point.
Let's get a search party...

103
00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:46.841
Stop!

104
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.052
Just stop.

105
00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:52.430
Every time you step outside,
disaster follows.

106
00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:54.641
Can you not see that
I have bigger problems?

107
00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:58.395
Winter is almost here
and I have an entire village to feed!

108
00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:03.650
Between you and me, the village
could do with a little less feeding.

109
00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.735
This isn't a joke, Hiccup!

110
00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:09.072
Why can't you follow
the simplest orders?

111
00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:13.868
I can't stop myself. I see a dragon
and I have to just kill it.

112
00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:16.037
It's who I am, Dad.

113
00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:21.418
You're many things, Hiccup.
But a dragon killer is not one of them.

114
00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:23.378
Get back to the house.

115
00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:25.505
Make sure he gets there.

116
00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:28.299
I have his mess to clean up.

117
00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:30.552
Quite the performance.

118
00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:33.513
I've never seen anyone
mess up that badly. That helped.

119
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.307
Thank you, thank you. I was trying.

120
00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:41.771
- I really did hit one.
- Sure, Hiccup.

121
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.190
- He never listens.
- It runs in the family.

122
00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:47.110
When he does,
it's with this disappointed scowl,

123
00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:49.696
like someone skimped on meat
in his sandwich.

124
00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:53.908
"Excuse me, barmaid.
You brought me the wrong offspring.

125
00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:58.830
I ordered an extra-large boy with beefy
arms, extra guts and glory on the side.

126
00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:01.750
This here, this is a talking fish bone."

127
00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:03.960
You're thinking about this wrong.

128
00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:08.590
It's not so much what you look like,
it's what's inside that he can't stand.

129
00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:11.134
Thank you for summing that up.

130
00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:15.513
Look, the point is, stop trying
so hard to be something you're not.

131
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.016
I just want to be one of you guys.

132
00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:31.112
Either we finish them
or they'll finish us!

133
00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:33.823
It's the only way
we'll be rid of them.

134
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.992
If we find the nest and destroy it,

135
00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:39.329
the dragons will leave.
They'll find another home!

136
00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:41.998
One more search
before the ice sets in.

137
00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:44.167
Those ships never come back.

138
00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:48.797
We're Vikings. It's an occupational
hazard. Now who's with me?!

139
00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:49.964
Count me out.

140
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:52.217
- Today's no good for me.
- I have to do my axe returns.

141
00:09:52.383 --> 00:09:55.512
All right. Those who stay
will look after Hiccup.

142
00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:57.263
- To the ships!
- I'm with you!

143
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:58.515
That's more like it.

144
00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:01.851
I'll pack my undies.

145
00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:04.938
No, I need you to stay
and train some new recruits.

146
00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:09.526
Perfect. And, while I'm busy,
Hiccup can cover the stall.

147
00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:12.862
Molten steel, razor-sharp blades,
lots of time to himself.

148
00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:15.031
What could possibly go wrong?

149
00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:17.325
What am I going
to do with him, Gobber?

150
00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:18.827
Put him in training.

151
00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:21.204
- No, I'm serious.
- So am I.

152
00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:24.207
He'd be killed before
the first dragon is out of its cage.

153
00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:25.959
- You don't know that.
- I do, actually.

154
00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:27.585
- No, you don't.
- No, I do.

155
00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:28.962
No, you don't.

156
00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:30.880
Listen, you know what he's like.

157
00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:35.009
From the time he could crawl,
he's been... different.

158
00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:39.681
He doesn't listen. He has
the attention span of a sparrow.

159
00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:43.351
I take him fishing
and he goes hunting for trolls!

160
00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:46.062
Trolls exist. They steal your socks.

161
00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:49.232
But only the left ones.
What's with that?

162
00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:50.650
- When I was a boy...
- Here we go.

163
00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:53.695
...my father told me to bang
my head against a rock and I did it.

164
00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:56.656
I thought it was crazy,
but I didn't question him.

165
00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:58.992
- And you know what happened?
- You got a headache.

166
00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:01.119
That rock split in two.

167
00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:04.372
It taught me what
a Viking could do, Gobber.

168
00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:08.543
He could crush mountains,
level forests, tame seas!

169
00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:13.756
Even as a boy, I knew what I was,
what I had to become.

170
00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:16.426
Hiccup is not that boy.

171
00:11:16.593 --> 00:11:18.887
You can't stop him, Stoick.

172
00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:21.222
You can only prepare him.

173
00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:25.602
I know it seems hopeless, but you won't
always be around to protect him.

174
00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:29.856
He's going to get out there again.
He's probably out there now.

175
00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:50.293
Oh, the gods hate me.

176
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.630
Some people lose their knife
or their mug. Not me.

177
00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:56.799
I manage to lose an entire dragon.

178
00:12:46.015 --> 00:12:48.309
Oh, wow. I did it.

179
00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:52.397
I did it. This fixes everything! Yes!

180
00:12:52.563 --> 00:12:54.899
I have brought down
this mighty beast!

181
00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:25.305
I'm going to kill you, dragon.

182
00:13:25.763 --> 00:13:29.726
Then I'll cut out your heart
and take it to my father.

183
00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:33.187
I am a Viking. I am a Viking!

184
00:14:07.388 --> 00:14:09.307
I did this.

185
00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:24.632
Hiccup.

186
00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:26.509
Dad...

187
00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:29.178
...I have to talk to you, Dad.

188
00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:31.514
I need to speak with you, too, son.

189
00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:35.393
- I don't want to fight dragons.
- It's time you learn to fight dragons.

190
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.561
- What?
- What?

191
00:15:36.727 --> 00:15:39.439
- You go first.
- No, you go first.

192
00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:40.690
All right.

193
00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:45.194
You get your wish. Dragon training...
you start in the morning.

194
00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:47.363
Oh, man, I should have gone first.

195
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.282
I was thinking, you know,

196
00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:52.452
we have a surplus
of dragon-fighting Vikings,

197
00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:57.206
but do we have enough bread-making
Vikings or small-home-repair Vikings?

198
00:15:57.373 --> 00:15:58.374
You'll need this.

199
00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:00.751
I don't want to fight dragons.

200
00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:02.336
Come on. Yes, you do.

201
00:16:02.503 --> 00:16:06.382
Rephrase. Dad, I can't kill dragons.

202
00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:08.342
But you will kill dragons.

203
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:11.512
No, I'm really very extra-sure
that I won't.

204
00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:13.556
- It's time, Hiccup.
- Can you not hear me?

205
00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:15.892
This is serious, son.

206
00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:21.314
When you carry this axe,
you carry all of us with you.

207
00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:25.151
Which means you walk like us,
you talk like us...

208
00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:27.195
...you think like us.

209
00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:29.530
No more of... this.

210
00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:31.657
You just gestured to all of me.

211
00:16:32.074 --> 00:16:35.119
- Deal?
- This conversation is very one-sided.

212
00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:36.579
Deal?

213
00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:39.582
Deal.

214
00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:42.210
Good.

215
00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:45.087
Train hard.

216
00:16:45.463 --> 00:16:47.757
I'll be back. Probably.

217
00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:50.468
And I'll be here.

218
00:16:50.801 --> 00:16:52.261
Maybe.

219
00:16:54.138 --> 00:16:55.765
Welcome to dragon training!

220
00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:58.351
No turning back.

221
00:17:15.743 --> 00:17:17.620
I hope I get some serious burns.

222
00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:21.374
I'm hoping for some mauling,
like on my shoulder or back.

223
00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:23.793
Yeah, it's only fun if you get
a scar out of it.

224
00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.211
Yeah, no kidding, right?

225
00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:27.380
Pain. Love it.

226
00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:29.257
Oh, great. Who let him in?

227
00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:32.134
Let's get started!
The recruit who does best

228
00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:34.929
will win the honor
of killing his first dragon

229
00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:36.806
in front of the entire village.

230
00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:41.477
Hiccup already killed a Night Fury,
so does that disqualify him?

231
00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:44.146
Can I transfer to the class
with the cool Vikings?

232
00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:48.317
Don't worry. You're small and weak...
that'll make you less of a target.

233
00:17:48.484 --> 00:17:50.236
They'll see you as sick or insane

234
00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:53.573
and go after the more
Viking-like teens instead.

235
00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:57.285
Behind these doors
are just a few of the many species

236
00:17:57.451 --> 00:17:58.452
you will learn to fight!

237
00:17:58.619 --> 00:18:01.122
- The Deadly Nadder!
- Speed 8, armor 16.

238
00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:02.623
The Hideous Zippleback.

239
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:04.166
Plus 11 stealth. Times 2.

240
00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:06.335
- The Monstrous Nightmare.
- Firepower 15.

241
00:18:06.502 --> 00:18:08.504
- The Terrible Terror.
- Attack 8, venom 12.

242
00:18:08.671 --> 00:18:10.381
Can you stop that?!

243
00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:13.426
And the Gronckle.

244
00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:15.678
Jaw strength 8.

245
00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:17.346
Wait, aren't you gonna teach us first?

246
00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:20.016
I believe in learning on the job.

247
00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:24.854
Today is about survival.
If you get blasted...

248
00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:27.148
...you're dead!

249
00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:28.941
What's the first thing you'll need?

250
00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:30.860
- A doctor?
- Plus 5 speed?

251
00:18:31.193 --> 00:18:33.237
- A shield.
- Shields. Go!

252
00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:36.699
Your most important piece of equipment
is your shield!

253
00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:40.870
If you must choose between
a sword or a shield, take the shield!

254
00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:43.039
- Let go of my shield!
- There are a million shields!

255
00:18:43.205 --> 00:18:45.249
Take that one. It has a flower...
girls like flowers.

256
00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.585
Oops, this one has blood on it.

257
00:18:49.712 --> 00:18:51.672
- Tuffnut, Ruff nut! You're out!
- What?

258
00:18:51.839 --> 00:18:53.507
Shields are good for another thing.

259
00:18:53.674 --> 00:18:57.928
Noise! Make lots of it
to throw off a dragon's aim!

260
00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:01.724
All dragons have
a limited number of shots.

261
00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:04.101
How many does a Gronckle have?

262
00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:05.561
- Five?
- No, six!

263
00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:07.897
Correct, six!
That's one for each of you!

264
00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:10.399
Fishlegs, out!

265
00:19:10.566 --> 00:19:12.610
Hiccup, get in there!

266
00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:18.908
I moved into my parents' basement.
Come by sometime and work out.

267
00:19:19.283 --> 00:19:20.701
You look like you work out.

268
00:19:20.868 --> 00:19:22.745
Snotlout! You're done!

269
00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:24.580
So it's just you and me, huh?

270
00:19:24.747 --> 00:19:26.374
Nope, just you.

271
00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:29.251
One shot left!

272
00:19:30.544 --> 00:19:31.629
Hiccup!

273
00:19:39.762 --> 00:19:41.639
And that's six.

274
00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:44.850
Go back to bed,
you overgrown sausage!

275
00:19:46.769 --> 00:19:49.563
You'll get another chance,
don't you worry.

276
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.733
Remember, a dragon will always,

277
00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:56.445
always go for the kill.

278
00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:05.663
So... why didn't you?

279
00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:34.692
This was stupid.

280
00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:20.905
Why don't you just fly away?

281
00:21:57.066 --> 00:21:59.735
<i>All right, where did Astrid go wrong
in the ring today?</i>

282
00:21:59.902 --> 00:22:02.655
<i>I mistimed my somersault dive.
It was sloppy.</i>

283
00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:05.407
<i>- It threw off my reverse tumble.
- Yeah, we noticed.</i>

284
00:22:05.574 --> 00:22:07.576
No, no, you were great.
That was so "Astrid."

285
00:22:07.743 --> 00:22:10.287
She's right. You have to be
tough on yourselves.

286
00:22:10.454 --> 00:22:12.206
Where did Hiccup go wrong?

287
00:22:12.373 --> 00:22:14.875
- He showed up.
- He didn't get eaten.

288
00:22:15.042 --> 00:22:16.752
He's never where he should be.

289
00:22:16.919 --> 00:22:18.838
Thank you, Astrid.

290
00:22:19.088 --> 00:22:23.592
You need to live and breathe
this stuff. The dragon manual.

291
00:22:24.426 --> 00:22:27.972
Everything we know about
every dragon we know of.

292
00:22:30.599 --> 00:22:32.560
No attacks tonight. Study up.

293
00:22:32.726 --> 00:22:34.353
Wait, you mean read?

294
00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.771
While we're still alive?

295
00:22:35.938 --> 00:22:37.857
Why read words
when you can just kill the stuff

296
00:22:38.023 --> 00:22:39.692
the words tell you stuff about?

297
00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:42.778
I've read it seven times.
There's this water dragon

298
00:22:42.945 --> 00:22:46.240
that sprays boiling water at your
face. And there's this other one...

299
00:22:46.657 --> 00:22:48.075
Yeah. That sounds great.

300
00:22:48.242 --> 00:22:51.453
- There was a chance I'd read it...
- But now...

301
00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.205
You guys read. I'll go kill stuff.

302
00:22:53.622 --> 00:22:56.500
Another one has spines like trees.

303
00:22:56.667 --> 00:22:58.836
- So I guess we'll share?
- Read it.

304
00:22:59.128 --> 00:23:03.799
All mine, then. Wow.
So, OK, I'll see you...

305
00:23:04.133 --> 00:23:05.593
...tomorrow.

306
00:23:15.686 --> 00:23:17.563
Dragon classifications.

307
00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:20.983
Strike class.
Fear class. Mystery class.

308
00:23:21.859 --> 00:23:26.655
Thunderdrum. This reclusive dragon
inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools.

309
00:23:26.822 --> 00:23:29.825
When startled, the Thunderdrum
produces a concussive sound

310
00:23:29.992 --> 00:23:31.744
that can kill a man at close range.

311
00:23:31.911 --> 00:23:34.830
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.

312
00:23:34.997 --> 00:23:38.834
Timber jack. This gigantic creature
has razor-sharp wings

313
00:23:39.001 --> 00:23:40.961
that can slice through full-grown trees.

314
00:23:41.128 --> 00:23:44.131
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.

315
00:23:44.298 --> 00:23:49.136
Scauldron. Sprays scalding water
at its victim. Extremely dangerous.

316
00:23:55.059 --> 00:23:59.229
Changewing. Even newly hatched
dragons can spray acid. Kill on sight.

317
00:23:59.521 --> 00:24:03.067
Gronckle. Zippleback. The Skrill.

318
00:24:03.525 --> 00:24:06.695
Bone Knapper. Whispering Death.

319
00:24:07.988 --> 00:24:09.865
Burns its victims. Buries its victims.

320
00:24:10.032 --> 00:24:12.993
Chokes its victims.
Turns its victims inside out.

321
00:24:13.243 --> 00:24:15.996
Extremely dangerous.
Extremely dangerous.

322
00:24:16.246 --> 00:24:19.875
Kill on sight.
Kill on sight. Kill on sight.

323
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:23.045
Night Fury.

324
00:24:23.712 --> 00:24:27.257
Speed unknown. Size unknown.

325
00:24:27.716 --> 00:24:31.887
The unholy offspring
of lightning and death itself.

326
00:24:32.054 --> 00:24:33.847
Never engage this dragon.

327
00:24:34.014 --> 00:24:38.185
Your only chance: hide and pray
it does not find you.

328
00:24:52.116 --> 00:24:54.076
I can almost smell them.

329
00:24:54.243 --> 00:24:55.869
They're close.

330
00:24:56.912 --> 00:24:58.330
Steady.

331
00:25:09.091 --> 00:25:10.342
Take us in.

332
00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:13.262
Hard to port. For Helheim's Gate.

333
00:25:13.595 --> 00:25:15.264
Hard to port!

334
00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:20.769
Steady!

335
00:25:33.073 --> 00:25:37.286
Hey, you know, I just happened to notice
the book had nothing on Night Furies.

336
00:25:37.578 --> 00:25:42.124
Is there another book, or a sequel?
Maybe a Night Fury pamphlet?

337
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.503
Focus, Hiccup!
You're not even trying!

338
00:25:48.255 --> 00:25:51.383
Today it's all about attack!

339
00:25:51.842 --> 00:25:54.261
Nadders are quick and light
on their feet.

340
00:25:54.428 --> 00:25:57.139
Your job is to be quicker and lighter!

341
00:25:59.433 --> 00:26:02.144
I'm really beginning to question
your teaching methods!

342
00:26:02.311 --> 00:26:04.772
Look for its blind spot!
Every dragon has one.

343
00:26:04.938 --> 00:26:07.858
Find it, hide in it and strike!

344
00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:10.778
Do you ever bathe?

345
00:26:10.944 --> 00:26:13.530
If you don't like it, then
just get your own blind spot.

346
00:26:13.697 --> 00:26:15.657
How about I give you one?

347
00:26:17.326 --> 00:26:20.245
Blind spot, yes.
Deaf spot, not so much.

348
00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:24.124
Hey, so, how would one sneak up
on a Night Fury?

349
00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:27.795
No one's ever met one and lived
to tell the tale. Get in there!

350
00:26:27.961 --> 00:26:30.297
- I know, I know, but hypothetically...
- Hiccup!

351
00:26:30.464 --> 00:26:31.799
Get down.

352
00:26:45.938 --> 00:26:47.940
Watch out, babe.
I'll take care of this.

353
00:26:49.108 --> 00:26:51.944
The sun was in my eyes, Astrid.

354
00:26:52.236 --> 00:26:54.071
What do you want me to do,
block out the sun?

355
00:26:54.238 --> 00:26:56.156
I could do that but I don't have time!

356
00:26:56.323 --> 00:26:58.117
They probably...

357
00:26:58.283 --> 00:27:02.079
...take the daytime off, right?
Like a cat.

358
00:27:02.246 --> 00:27:04.373
Has anyone ever seen one napping?

359
00:27:04.873 --> 00:27:05.999
Hiccup!

360
00:27:07.376 --> 00:27:08.710
Hiccup!

361
00:27:11.421 --> 00:27:13.715
Love on the battlefield.

362
00:27:13.882 --> 00:27:14.925
She could do better.

363
00:27:15.092 --> 00:27:16.718
Let me... Why don't you...?

364
00:27:26.186 --> 00:27:27.521
Well done, Astrid.

365
00:27:29.523 --> 00:27:32.234
Is this some kind of a joke to you?

366
00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.487
Our parents' war
is about to become ours.

367
00:27:35.654 --> 00:27:37.865
Figure out which side you're on.

368
00:28:59.321 --> 00:29:01.156
Toothless.

369
00:29:01.323 --> 00:29:03.533
I could have sworn you had...

370
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:07.871
...teeth.

371
00:29:12.084 --> 00:29:13.126
No, no, no.

372
00:29:15.045 --> 00:29:16.505
I don't have any more!

373
00:33:13.158 --> 00:33:17.287
And with one twist, he took my hand
and swallowed it whole!

374
00:33:17.454 --> 00:33:20.582
I saw the look on his face...
I was delicious.

375
00:33:20.749 --> 00:33:22.042
He must have passed the word,

376
00:33:22.209 --> 00:33:25.754
because it wasn't a month before
another one of them took my leg.

377
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:29.591
Isn't it weird to think
your hand was inside a dragon?

378
00:33:29.758 --> 00:33:31.968
Like if your mind was still
in control of it,

379
00:33:32.135 --> 00:33:35.680
you could have killed the dragon
from inside by crushing his heart.

380
00:33:35.847 --> 00:33:40.602
I swear, I'm so angry. I'll avenge your
beautiful hand and your beautiful foot.

381
00:33:40.769 --> 00:33:44.773
I'll chop off the legs of every dragon
I fight, with my face.

382
00:33:46.274 --> 00:33:48.443
It's the wings and the tails
you really want.

383
00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:51.071
If it can't fly, it can't get away.

384
00:33:51.238 --> 00:33:54.533
A downed dragon is a dead dragon.

385
00:33:57.661 --> 00:34:00.372
All right, I'm off to bed.
You should be, too.

386
00:34:00.539 --> 00:34:03.792
Tomorrow we get to the big boys,
slowly but surely

387
00:34:03.959 --> 00:34:07.170
making our way up
to the Monstrous Nightmare.

388
00:34:07.337 --> 00:34:09.839
But who'll win the honor of killing it?

389
00:34:10.006 --> 00:34:13.260
It's gonna be me. It's my destiny. See?

390
00:34:13.426 --> 00:34:15.512
Your mom let you get a tattoo?

391
00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:17.389
It's not a tattoo, it's a birthmark.

392
00:34:17.556 --> 00:34:21.309
OK, I've been stuck with you since
birth, and that was never there before.

393
00:34:21.476 --> 00:34:24.312
Yes, it was. You've just never
seen me from the left side.

394
00:35:04.811 --> 00:35:07.522
Hey, Toothless.

395
00:35:07.689 --> 00:35:11.526
I brought breakfast. I hope...
I hope you're hungry.

396
00:35:12.652 --> 00:35:14.654
OK, that's disgusting.

397
00:35:14.904 --> 00:35:18.575
We've got some salmon,
some nice Icelandic cod...

398
00:35:18.742 --> 00:35:20.910
...and a whole smoked eel.

399
00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:29.252
No, no, no, no, no!
No, it's OK.

400
00:35:29.794 --> 00:35:32.005
Yeah, I don't really like
eel much, either.

401
00:35:35.634 --> 00:35:36.926
That's it.

402
00:35:37.677 --> 00:35:39.804
That's it.
Just stick with the good stuff.

403
00:35:40.263 --> 00:35:43.933
And don't you mind me.
I'll just be back here,

404
00:35:44.392 --> 00:35:46.936
minding my own business.

405
00:35:59.407 --> 00:36:00.700
It's OK.

406
00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:12.045
OK.

407
00:36:26.434 --> 00:36:27.769
That's not too bad. It works.

408
00:36:33.316 --> 00:36:35.318
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

409
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.872
Oh, my...! It's working!

410
00:36:54.087 --> 00:36:55.964
Yes, yes! I did it!

411
00:37:08.226 --> 00:37:09.227
Yeah!

412
00:37:09.394 --> 00:37:11.354
<i>Today is about teamwork.</i>

413
00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:17.569
Now, a wet dragon head
can't light its fire.

414
00:37:17.819 --> 00:37:21.698
The Hideous Zippleback
is extra tricky.

415
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:25.326
One head breathes gas,
the other head lights it.

416
00:37:26.494 --> 00:37:29.289
Your job is to know which is which.

417
00:37:29.456 --> 00:37:32.625
Razor-sharp serrated teeth
that inject venom for pre-digestion.

418
00:37:32.792 --> 00:37:35.128
Prefers ambush attack,
crushing its victims...

419
00:37:35.295 --> 00:37:36.588
Will you please stop that?!

420
00:37:40.842 --> 00:37:44.679
If that dragon shows
either of his faces, I'm gonna...

421
00:37:44.846 --> 00:37:46.055
There!

422
00:37:47.015 --> 00:37:49.559
Hey, it's us, idiots!

423
00:37:49.726 --> 00:37:52.479
Your butts are getting bigger.
We thought you were a dragon.

424
00:37:52.687 --> 00:37:56.024
Not that there's anything wrong
with a dragonesque figure.

425
00:37:59.736 --> 00:38:00.737
Wait.

426
00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.992
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!

427
00:38:06.159 --> 00:38:09.037
Chances of survival are
dwindling to single digits now.

428
00:38:16.628 --> 00:38:18.046
Wrong head.

429
00:38:18.671 --> 00:38:19.672
Fishlegs!

430
00:38:22.884 --> 00:38:23.885
Now, Hiccup!

431
00:38:26.888 --> 00:38:28.765
Oh, come on.

432
00:38:33.436 --> 00:38:34.771
Hiccup!

433
00:38:36.523 --> 00:38:39.067
Back, back, back!

434
00:38:39.692 --> 00:38:43.863
Now, don't you make me tell you again!
Yes, that's right.

435
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:47.867
Back into your cage.
Now think about what you've done.

436
00:38:57.877 --> 00:39:02.924
OK, so are we done? 'Cause I've got
some things I need to...

437
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:05.802
Yep, I'll see you tomorrow!

438
00:39:57.937 --> 00:39:59.856
I've never seen a Gronckle do that.

439
00:40:00.023 --> 00:40:04.903
I left my axe back in the ring. You guys
go on ahead. I'll catch up with you.

440
00:40:44.692 --> 00:40:47.070
Meet the Terrible Terror.

441
00:40:49.322 --> 00:40:50.531
It's like the size of my...

442
00:40:51.908 --> 00:40:53.076
Get it off!

443
00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:56.579
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!

444
00:40:59.374 --> 00:41:01.668
Wow! He's better than you ever were.

445
00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:47.922
Oh, great.

446
00:41:48.965 --> 00:41:50.049
Hiccup.

447
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:07.525
Hiccup? Are you in there?

448
00:42:09.277 --> 00:42:10.653
Astrid. Hey.

449
00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.406
Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid.

450
00:42:13.573 --> 00:42:16.492
I normally don't care what people do,
but you're acting weird.

451
00:42:18.119 --> 00:42:19.370
Well, weirder.

452
00:42:48.024 --> 00:42:51.736
- I trust you found the nest, at least?
- Not even close.

453
00:42:51.903 --> 00:42:52.904
Excellent.

454
00:42:53.071 --> 00:42:55.281
I hope you had more success than me.

455
00:42:55.448 --> 00:42:59.786
Well, if by success, you mean that
your parenting troubles are over, yes.

456
00:42:59.994 --> 00:43:03.289
Congratulations, Stoick!
Everyone is so relieved!

457
00:43:03.456 --> 00:43:05.583
Out with the old and
in with the new, right?

458
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:09.128
- No one will miss that nuisance!
- We're throwing a party to celebrate!

459
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:10.838
- Come over here.
- Hurry!

460
00:43:11.005 --> 00:43:12.006
He's gone?

461
00:43:14.175 --> 00:43:18.096
Most afternoons, but who can blame
him? The life of a celebrity's rough.

462
00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:22.016
He can barely walk through the village
without being swarmed by his new fans.

463
00:43:22.183 --> 00:43:23.184
Hiccup?

464
00:43:23.351 --> 00:43:27.480
Who would have thought it?
He has this way with the beasts.

465
00:43:35.696 --> 00:43:39.325
OK, bud.
We're gonna take this nice and slow.

466
00:43:39.492 --> 00:43:41.244
Here we go. Here we go. Position...

467
00:43:41.911 --> 00:43:43.913
...three... no, four.

468
00:44:03.182 --> 00:44:05.810
All right, it's go time. It's go time.

469
00:44:11.899 --> 00:44:13.818
Come on, buddy! Come on, buddy!

470
00:44:21.826 --> 00:44:23.411
Yes, it worked!

471
00:44:28.082 --> 00:44:29.375
Sorry!

472
00:44:31.836 --> 00:44:33.045
It was my fault.

473
00:44:34.255 --> 00:44:36.382
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it. Position four.

474
00:44:36.883 --> 00:44:37.884
Three.

475
00:44:41.095 --> 00:44:43.097
Yeah! Go, baby!

476
00:44:43.848 --> 00:44:44.849
Yes!

477
00:44:45.016 --> 00:44:49.187
Oh, this is amazing!
The wind in my... cheat sheet!

478
00:44:49.353 --> 00:44:50.855
Stop!

479
00:44:53.566 --> 00:44:54.859
No!

480
00:44:57.945 --> 00:45:01.324
Oh, gosh! Oh, gods! Oh, no!

481
00:45:01.741 --> 00:45:04.869
All right, OK, you've gotta
kind of angle yourself.

482
00:45:05.036 --> 00:45:07.830
OK, no, no, no. Come back down
towards me! Come back down...

483
00:45:49.664 --> 00:45:51.290
Yeah!

484
00:45:53.125 --> 00:45:54.210
Come on.

485
00:46:03.261 --> 00:46:05.179
No, thanks. I'm good.

486
00:46:42.216 --> 00:46:45.344
Not so fireproof
on the inside, are you?

487
00:46:45.511 --> 00:46:46.637
Here you go.

488
00:47:03.195 --> 00:47:07.325
Everything we know
about you guys is wrong.

489
00:47:17.543 --> 00:47:20.504
Dad! You're back!
Gobber's not here so...

490
00:47:20.671 --> 00:47:21.672
I know.

491
00:47:24.258 --> 00:47:27.094
- I came looking for you.
- You did?

492
00:47:27.261 --> 00:47:28.763
You've been keeping secrets.

493
00:47:29.096 --> 00:47:30.473
I have?

494
00:47:30.639 --> 00:47:33.267
Just how long did you think
you could hide it?

495
00:47:33.434 --> 00:47:36.103
I don't know what you're...

496
00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:40.691
Nothing happens on this island
without me hearing about it.

497
00:47:41.484 --> 00:47:42.777
So...

498
00:47:43.486 --> 00:47:45.404
...let's talk...

499
00:47:45.571 --> 00:47:47.448
...about that dragon.

500
00:47:47.615 --> 00:47:51.786
Oh, gods. Dad, I'm so sorry.
I was going to tell you.

501
00:47:52.119 --> 00:47:54.372
I just didn't know how to...

502
00:47:59.168 --> 00:48:01.295
You're not upset?

503
00:48:01.462 --> 00:48:04.090
What?! I was hoping for this!

504
00:48:04.965 --> 00:48:07.635
- You were?
- And believe me, it only gets better!

505
00:48:07.802 --> 00:48:10.554
Wait till you spill
a Nadder's guts the first time!

506
00:48:10.721 --> 00:48:13.432
And mount your first
Gronckle head on a spear!

507
00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:17.395
What a feeling!
You really had me going there, son!

508
00:48:17.561 --> 00:48:21.732
All those years of the worst Viking
Berk has ever seen.

509
00:48:21.899 --> 00:48:25.194
Odin, it was rough.
I almost gave up on you.

510
00:48:25.361 --> 00:48:27.613
And all the while
you were holding out on me!

511
00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:29.657
Oh, Thor Almighty!

512
00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:33.828
With you doing so well in the ring...

513
00:48:35.162 --> 00:48:37.832
...we finally have something
to talk about.

514
00:48:51.554 --> 00:48:55.182
Here, I brought you something,

515
00:48:55.433 --> 00:48:58.144
to keep you safe in the ring.

516
00:48:58.310 --> 00:49:00.396
Wow. Thanks.

517
00:49:00.563 --> 00:49:05.443
Your mother would have wanted you to
have it. It's half of her breastplate.

518
00:49:07.027 --> 00:49:10.865
Matching set.
It keeps her close, you know.

519
00:49:11.574 --> 00:49:16.579
Wear it proudly. You deserve it.
You've held up your end of the deal.

520
00:49:22.209 --> 00:49:26.547
- I should really get to bed.
- Yes, good. OK, good talk.

521
00:49:26.714 --> 00:49:29.133
- I'll see you back at the house. Great.
- We should do this again.

522
00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:30.509
Thanks for stopping by...

523
00:49:30.676 --> 00:49:33.721
- ...and for the breast hat.
- I hope you like the hat.

524
00:49:35.723 --> 00:49:37.600
Well... Yep. Good night.

525
00:49:52.573 --> 00:49:55.576
Stay out of my way!
I'm winning this thing.

526
00:49:55.743 --> 00:49:58.454
Please, by all means.

527
00:50:10.508 --> 00:50:12.593
This time, this time for sure!

528
00:50:21.435 --> 00:50:24.188
No! No, son of a half-troll,

529
00:50:24.355 --> 00:50:27.358
- rat-eating, munge-bucket!
- Wait, wait.

530
00:50:27.525 --> 00:50:29.360
- So, later.
- Not so fast.

531
00:50:29.527 --> 00:50:31.487
- I'm kind of late for...
- What?!

532
00:50:31.654 --> 00:50:34.198
Late for what, exactly?

533
00:50:34.365 --> 00:50:37.201
Quiet down! The elder has decided.

534
00:50:48.629 --> 00:50:52.883
You've done it, Hiccup!
You get to kill the dragon!

535
00:50:56.178 --> 00:50:57.346
That's my boy!

536
00:50:57.513 --> 00:51:01.225
Yeah. Yes. I can't wait. I am so...

537
00:51:01.392 --> 00:51:03.310
...leaving! We're leaving.

538
00:51:03.477 --> 00:51:07.940
Let's pack up. Looks like you and me
are taking a little vacation.

539
00:51:08.399 --> 00:51:09.650
Forever.

540
00:51:12.403 --> 00:51:13.946
Oh, man.

541
00:51:15.906 --> 00:51:18.993
What the...?!
What are you doing here?

542
00:51:19.827 --> 00:51:22.246
I want to know what's going on.

543
00:51:22.413 --> 00:51:26.500
No one just gets as good as you do.
Especially you.

544
00:51:26.667 --> 00:51:29.503
Start talking!
Are you training with someone?

545
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:30.713
Training?

546
00:51:30.879 --> 00:51:32.506
It better not involve this.

547
00:51:32.673 --> 00:51:36.302
I know this looks really bad,
but you see...

548
00:51:38.679 --> 00:51:40.681
You're right. You're right.
You're right.

549
00:51:40.848 --> 00:51:45.978
I'm through with the lies.
I've been making outfits. So you got me.

550
00:51:46.312 --> 00:51:50.274
It's time everyone knew.
Drag me back, go ahead. Here we go.

551
00:51:50.858 --> 00:51:52.401
Why would you do that?!

552
00:51:52.568 --> 00:51:56.989
That's for the lies.
And that's for everything else.

553
00:51:57.781 --> 00:51:58.782
Oh, man.

554
00:52:00.242 --> 00:52:01.243
Get down!

555
00:52:03.203 --> 00:52:04.580
Run, run!

556
00:52:07.207 --> 00:52:09.001
It's OK! It's OK.

557
00:52:09.335 --> 00:52:10.711
She's a friend.

558
00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.214
You just scared him.

559
00:52:14.381 --> 00:52:15.883
I scared him?!

560
00:52:16.884 --> 00:52:18.510
Who is "him"?

561
00:52:19.595 --> 00:52:23.599
Astrid, Toothless. Toothless, Astrid.

562
00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:30.898
We're dead.

563
00:52:31.899 --> 00:52:34.026
Where do you think you're going?

564
00:52:40.157 --> 00:52:43.035
Oh, great Odin's ghost! This is it!

565
00:52:53.921 --> 00:52:56.256
Hiccup, get me down from here!

566
00:52:56.423 --> 00:52:58.592
You have to give me a chance to explain.

567
00:52:58.759 --> 00:53:01.428
I am not listening
to anything you have to say!

568
00:53:01.595 --> 00:53:05.057
Then I won't speak.
Just let me show you.

569
00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:07.976
Please, Astrid.

570
00:53:23.951 --> 00:53:25.035
Now get me down.

571
00:53:25.202 --> 00:53:27.955
Toothless, down. Gently.

572
00:53:29.748 --> 00:53:32.459
See? Nothing to be afraid of.

573
00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:37.339
Toothless!

574
00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:41.343
What is wrong with you?! Bad dragon!

575
00:53:42.469 --> 00:53:45.347
He's not usually like this.
Oh, no.

576
00:53:50.894 --> 00:53:54.022
Toothless, what are you doing?
We need her to like us!

577
00:53:57.025 --> 00:53:59.027
And now the spinning.

578
00:53:59.903 --> 00:54:03.073
Thank you for nothing,
you useless reptile.

579
00:54:03.824 --> 00:54:06.827
OK, I am sorry! I'm sorry.

580
00:54:07.119 --> 00:54:08.829
Just get me off of this thing.

581
00:55:55.519 --> 00:55:59.231
All right, I admit it.
This is pretty cool.

582
00:55:59.565 --> 00:56:02.109
It's amazing.

583
00:56:02.442 --> 00:56:03.986
He's amazing.

584
00:56:06.655 --> 00:56:08.782
So what now?

585
00:56:08.949 --> 00:56:11.785
Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow.

586
00:56:12.077 --> 00:56:14.079
You know you'll have to kill...

587
00:56:14.663 --> 00:56:15.789
...kill a dragon.

588
00:56:15.956 --> 00:56:17.666
Don't remind me.

589
00:56:18.792 --> 00:56:20.210
Toothless, what's happening?

590
00:56:22.671 --> 00:56:24.089
What is it?

591
00:56:26.884 --> 00:56:27.968
Get down!

592
00:56:45.235 --> 00:56:46.987
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

593
00:56:47.154 --> 00:56:50.157
Toothless, you gotta get us
out of here, bud.

594
00:56:52.701 --> 00:56:55.120
It looks like
they're hauling in their kill.

595
00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:57.831
What does that make us?

596
00:57:40.749 --> 00:57:43.251
What my dad wouldn't give
to find this.

597
00:58:00.185 --> 00:58:03.647
It's satisfying to know that all of
our food has been dumped down a hole.

598
00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:06.650
They're not eating any of it.

599
00:58:22.124 --> 00:58:23.750
What is that?

600
00:58:30.882 --> 00:58:33.885
All right, bud,
we got to get out of here... now!

601
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:47.065
It totally makes sense.
It's like a giant beehive.

602
00:58:47.232 --> 00:58:49.234
They're the workers
and that's their queen.

603
00:58:49.401 --> 00:58:51.945
It controls them. Let's find your dad.

604
00:58:52.112 --> 00:58:53.363
No! No.

605
00:58:53.697 --> 00:58:57.784
No, not yet. They'll kill Toothless.

606
00:58:57.951 --> 00:59:00.662
We have to think this through
carefully.

607
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:03.749
Hiccup, we just discovered
the dragons' nest,

608
00:59:03.915 --> 00:59:06.626
the thing we've been after
since Vikings first sailed here,

609
00:59:06.793 --> 00:59:09.087
and you want to keep it a secret?

610
00:59:09.254 --> 00:59:12.174
To protect your pet dragon?
Are you serious?

611
00:59:14.301 --> 00:59:15.510
Yes.

612
00:59:22.976 --> 00:59:25.479
OK. Then what do we do?

613
00:59:25.645 --> 00:59:29.399
Just give me until tomorrow.
I'll figure something out.

614
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:31.318
OK.

615
00:59:32.861 --> 00:59:34.154
That's for kidnapping me.

616
00:59:41.161 --> 00:59:43.872
That's for everything else.

617
00:59:53.048 --> 00:59:55.050
What are you looking at?

618
00:59:55.801 --> 00:59:59.930
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

619
01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:06.144
I can show my face in public again!

620
01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:11.566
If someone had told me
that in a few short weeks

621
01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:16.321
Hiccup would go from, well,
being Hiccup

622
01:00:16.488 --> 01:00:20.992
to placing first in dragon training,
well, I would have tied him to a mast

623
01:00:21.159 --> 01:00:23.745
and shipped him off
for fear he'd gone mad!

624
01:00:24.412 --> 01:00:25.747
And you know it!

625
01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:32.712
But here we are.
And no one is more surprised

626
01:00:32.879 --> 01:00:35.882
or more proud than I am.

627
01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:39.803
Today, my boy becomes a Viking.

628
01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:43.181
Today, he becomes one of us!

629
01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:49.062
Be careful with that dragon.

630
01:00:49.229 --> 01:00:52.649
- It's not the dragon I'm worried about.
- What are you going to do?

631
01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:55.902
Put an end to this. I have to try.

632
01:00:56.611 --> 01:01:00.031
Astrid, if something goes wrong,

633
01:01:00.198 --> 01:01:02.242
just make sure
they don't find Toothless.

634
01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:06.454
I will. Just promise me
it won't go wrong.

635
01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:10.458
It's time, Hiccup. Knock 'em dead.

636
01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:18.466
Yeah! Show 'em how it's done.

637
01:01:18.633 --> 01:01:21.887
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

638
01:01:34.399 --> 01:01:35.942
I would have gone for the hammer.

639
01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:41.281
I'm ready.

640
01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:07.933
Go on, Hiccup. Give it to him!

641
01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:13.688
What is he doing?

642
01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:19.110
Hey, it's OK. It's OK.

643
01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:28.161
I'm not one of them.

644
01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:34.542
What's he thinking?

645
01:02:35.126 --> 01:02:36.586
- Stop the fight.
- No!

646
01:02:37.045 --> 01:02:39.464
I need you all to see this.

647
01:02:40.382 --> 01:02:42.509
They're not what we think they are.

648
01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.678
We don't have to kill them.

649
01:02:46.179 --> 01:02:48.390
I said, stop the fight!

650
01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:57.148
Out of my way!

651
01:02:57.399 --> 01:02:58.483
Hiccup!

652
01:03:19.337 --> 01:03:20.463
Hiccup!

653
01:03:27.262 --> 01:03:28.555
This way!

654
01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:50.160
Night Fury!

655
01:04:08.762 --> 01:04:10.555
Toothless, go. Get out of here.

656
01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:13.933
Go, go!

657
01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:15.101
Stoick, no!

658
01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:16.644
Dad, he won't hurt you!

659
01:04:17.645 --> 01:04:20.690
No, don't!
You're only making it worse!

660
01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:22.817
Toothless, stop!

661
01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:26.446
No! No!

662
01:04:30.075 --> 01:04:31.076
Get him!

663
01:04:34.662 --> 01:04:36.664
No, no! Please just don't hurt him!

664
01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:38.792
Please don't hurt him.

665
01:04:45.757 --> 01:04:47.258
Put it with the others.

666
01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:52.514
I should have known.
I should have seen the signs.

667
01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.516
- Dad?
- We had a deal!

668
01:04:54.682 --> 01:04:58.728
I know we did. That was before...
It's all so messed up.

669
01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:02.315
So everything in the ring,
a trick? A lie?

670
01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:06.611
I screwed up. I should have
told you before now. I just...

671
01:05:06.778 --> 01:05:10.323
Take this out on me, be mad at me,
but please, just don't hurt Toothless.

672
01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:13.660
The dragon?
That's what you're worried about?

673
01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:15.537
Not the people you almost killed?

674
01:05:15.703 --> 01:05:18.123
He was protecting me!
He's not dangerous.

675
01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:20.291
They've killed hundreds of us!

676
01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:22.168
And we've killed thousands of them!

677
01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:27.590
They defend themselves, that's all!
They raid us because they have to.

678
01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:31.594
If they don't bring enough food back,
they'll be eaten themselves.

679
01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:36.057
There's something else
on their island. It's a dragon like...

680
01:05:36.224 --> 01:05:38.977
Their island?
So you've been to the nest?

681
01:05:39.144 --> 01:05:40.937
- Did I say nest?
- How did you find it?

682
01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:43.648
What? No, I didn't. Toothless did.

683
01:05:43.815 --> 01:05:46.526
Only a dragon can find the island.

684
01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:50.989
No, no, no. No, Dad.
No, please, it's not what you think.

685
01:05:51.156 --> 01:05:54.200
You don't know what you're up against.
It's like nothing you've ever seen.

686
01:05:54.367 --> 01:05:58.288
Dad, please. I promise you,
you can't win this one!

687
01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:00.498
No, Dad. No.

688
01:06:00.665 --> 01:06:03.626
For once in your life,
would you please just listen to me?!

689
01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:11.176
You've thrown your lot in with them.
You're not a Viking.

690
01:06:13.428 --> 01:06:15.305
You're not my son.

691
01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:19.767
Ready the ships!

692
01:06:31.779 --> 01:06:32.989
This way.

693
01:07:15.323 --> 01:07:16.866
Set sail!

694
01:07:17.242 --> 01:07:19.619
We head for Helheim's Gate.

695
01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:30.463
Lead us home, devil.

696
01:07:51.359 --> 01:07:52.860
It's a mess.

697
01:07:54.195 --> 01:07:57.448
You must feel horrible.
You've lost everything:

698
01:07:57.615 --> 01:08:00.493
your father, your tribe,
your best friend.

699
01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.829
Thank you for summing that up.

700
01:08:04.664 --> 01:08:08.167
Why couldn't I have killed that dragon
when I found him in the woods?

701
01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:12.630
- Would have been better for everyone.
- Yep. The rest of us would've done it.

702
01:08:13.506 --> 01:08:15.341
So why didn't you?

703
01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:20.805
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know.

704
01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:23.683
- I couldn't.
- That's not an answer.

705
01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:26.144
Why is this so important
to you all of a sudden?

706
01:08:26.311 --> 01:08:29.522
Because I want to remember
what you say right now.

707
01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:34.736
For the love of... I was a coward.
I was weak. I wouldn't kill a dragon.

708
01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:36.154
You said "wouldn't".

709
01:08:36.321 --> 01:08:38.489
Whatever! I wouldn't!

710
01:08:38.656 --> 01:08:42.535
Three hundred years and I'm the first
Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon.

711
01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.958
First one to ride one, though.

712
01:08:51.419 --> 01:08:52.420
So?

713
01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:58.760
I wouldn't kill him because
he looked as frightened as I was.

714
01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:03.431
I looked at him and I saw myself.

715
01:09:05.266 --> 01:09:09.937
I bet he's really frightened now.
What are you going to do about it?

716
01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:15.902
- Probably something stupid.
- Good, but you've already done that.

717
01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:19.530
Then something crazy.

718
01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:22.533
That's more like it.

719
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.253
Sound your positions.
Stay within earshot.

720
01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:36.923
- Here!
- One length to your stern.

721
01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:42.303
Listen, Stoick, I was overhearing some
of the men and, well, some of them

722
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:46.099
are wondering what it is
we're up to here. Not me, of course.

723
01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:48.768
I know you're always the man
with the plan. But some,

724
01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:52.438
not me, are wondering if there is
in fact a plan at all

725
01:09:52.605 --> 01:09:56.234
- and what it might be.
- Find the nest and take it.

726
01:09:56.401 --> 01:09:58.528
Of course. Send them running.

727
01:09:58.695 --> 01:10:01.447
The old Viking fallback.
Nice and simple.

728
01:10:10.373 --> 01:10:12.041
Step aside.

729
01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:26.514
Bear to port.

730
01:10:31.477 --> 01:10:35.815
If you're planning on getting eaten,
I'd definitely go with the Gronckle.

731
01:10:36.941 --> 01:10:40.987
You were wise to seek help
from the world's most deadly weapon.

732
01:10:41.154 --> 01:10:42.155
It's me.

733
01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:44.699
- I love this plan.
- I didn't...

734
01:10:44.866 --> 01:10:47.744
You're crazy. I like that.

735
01:10:48.202 --> 01:10:50.580
So, what is the plan?

736
01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:02.508
That's not really encouraging.

737
01:11:04.886 --> 01:11:06.971
I was wondering where that went.

738
01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:22.195
Stay low and ready your weapons.

739
01:11:37.877 --> 01:11:39.170
We're here.

740
01:12:12.119 --> 01:12:14.622
- Wait! What are you...?
- Relax.

741
01:12:14.789 --> 01:12:16.999
It's OK. It's OK.

742
01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:29.679
Where are you going?

743
01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:32.473
You'll need something
to help you hold on.

744
01:12:41.566 --> 01:12:45.736
When we crack this mountain open,
all hell is going to break loose.

745
01:12:45.903 --> 01:12:48.865
In my undies.
Good thing I brought extras.

746
01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:52.285
No matter how this ends,
it ends today.

747
01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:49.008
Is that it?

748
01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:55.014
We've done it!

749
01:14:03.898 --> 01:14:08.069
This isn't over!
Form your ranks! Hold together!

750
01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:22.875
Get clear!

751
01:14:32.385 --> 01:14:34.929
Beard of Thor! What is that?!

752
01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:41.018
Odin help us.

753
01:14:45.815 --> 01:14:46.899
Catapults!

754
01:14:56.575 --> 01:14:58.953
- Get to the ships!
- No! No!

755
01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:13.759
- Smart, that one.
- I was a fool.

756
01:15:13.926 --> 01:15:16.095
Lead the men
to the far side of the island!

757
01:15:16.262 --> 01:15:17.430
Gobber, go with the men!

758
01:15:17.596 --> 01:15:20.558
I think I'll stay, in case your
thinking of doing something crazy.

759
01:15:20.725 --> 01:15:23.853
I can buy them a few minutes
if I give that thing someone to hunt!

760
01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.563
Then I can double that time.

761
01:15:28.274 --> 01:15:31.610
- Here!
- Oh, no! Here!

762
01:15:41.746 --> 01:15:44.915
Come on! Fight me!

763
01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:46.959
No, me!

764
01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:55.801
Ruff, Tuff! Watch your backs!

765
01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:58.137
Move, Fishlegs!

766
01:15:58.304 --> 01:16:02.141
Look at us! We're on a dragon.
We're on dragons! All of us!

767
01:16:03.809 --> 01:16:06.103
Up! Let's move it!

768
01:16:06.604 --> 01:16:11.025
Every bit the boar-headed
stubborn Viking you ever were!

769
01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:14.445
- Fishlegs, break it down!
- OK.

770
01:16:14.612 --> 01:16:17.406
Heavily armored skull and tail
made for bashing and crushing!

771
01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:21.577
Steer clear of both. Small eyes, large
nostrils! Relies on hearing and smell!

772
01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:25.122
OK, Lout, Legs! Hang in its blind spot,
make noise, keep it confused!

773
01:16:25.289 --> 01:16:29.001
Ruff, Tuff, find out
if it has a shot limit! Make it mad!

774
01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:30.544
That's my specialty!

775
01:16:30.711 --> 01:16:34.006
Since when?! Everyone knows
I'm more irritating! See.

776
01:16:34.173 --> 01:16:37.426
Just do what I told you!
I'll be back as soon as I can!

777
01:16:37.843 --> 01:16:40.346
- Don't worry! We got it covered!
- Yeah!

778
01:16:49.355 --> 01:16:50.397
- Troll!
- Butt elf!

779
01:16:50.564 --> 01:16:52.108
Bride of Grendel!

780
01:16:57.905 --> 01:17:00.366
This thing doesn't have a blind spot!

781
01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.161
There!

782
01:17:12.628 --> 01:17:13.796
Go help the others!

783
01:17:15.673 --> 01:17:17.049
OK, hold on. Hold on.

784
01:17:21.011 --> 01:17:23.472
- It's working!
- Yeah, it's working!

785
01:17:33.107 --> 01:17:36.485
I've lost power on the Gronckle!
Snotlout, do something!

786
01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:41.448
I'm OK!

787
01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:43.075
Less OK!

788
01:17:45.744 --> 01:17:49.456
I can't miss! What's wrong, buddy?
Something in your eye?

789
01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:55.337
Yeah! You're the Viking!

790
01:18:33.083 --> 01:18:34.210
Dad?

791
01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:54.396
You got it, bud.

792
01:18:57.233 --> 01:18:58.359
Hiccup!

793
01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:04.073
I'm sorry... for everything.

794
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:05.574
Yeah. Me, too.

795
01:19:05.991 --> 01:19:07.618
You don't have to go up there.

796
01:19:08.327 --> 01:19:11.664
We're Vikings.
It's an occupational hazard.

797
01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:16.001
I'm proud to call you my son.

798
01:19:17.419 --> 01:19:18.420
Thanks, Dad.

799
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:25.803
He's up!

800
01:19:28.681 --> 01:19:30.224
Get Snotlout out of there.

801
01:19:30.391 --> 01:19:31.642
- I'm on it!
- I'm on it first!

802
01:19:31.809 --> 01:19:33.352
- Hey, let me drive!
- I'm ahead of you.

803
01:19:33.519 --> 01:19:34.979
No, this way.

804
01:19:35.145 --> 01:19:37.356
- Don't push me!
- I'll take your teeth out!

805
01:19:41.402 --> 01:19:43.153
I can't believe that worked!

806
01:19:50.369 --> 01:19:51.704
Night Fury!

807
01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:53.622
Get down!

808
01:20:03.507 --> 01:20:04.550
Did you get her?

809
01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:16.061
Go.

810
01:20:16.228 --> 01:20:20.607
That thing has wings.
OK, let's see if it can use them!

811
01:20:36.582 --> 01:20:38.584
You think that did it?

812
01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:45.257
Well, he can fly.

813
01:21:06.111 --> 01:21:08.822
OK, Toothless, time to disappear.

814
01:21:08.989 --> 01:21:10.240
Come on, bud!

815
01:21:16.288 --> 01:21:17.956
Here it comes!

816
01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:11.635
Watch out!

817
01:22:13.804 --> 01:22:16.140
OK, time's up! Let's see if this works.

818
01:22:18.934 --> 01:22:20.936
Come on! Is that the best you can do?!

819
01:22:38.829 --> 01:22:41.206
Stay with me, buddy.
Just a bit longer.

820
01:22:45.878 --> 01:22:47.504
Hold, Toothless.

821
01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:49.423
Now!

822
01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:14.531
No.

823
01:23:15.032 --> 01:23:16.408
No!

824
01:23:32.132 --> 01:23:33.467
Hiccup!

825
01:23:34.593 --> 01:23:36.261
Hiccup!

826
01:23:37.554 --> 01:23:38.805
Son!

827
01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:42.935
Hiccup.

828
01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:06.375
Oh, son.

829
01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:09.419
I did this.

830
01:24:39.199 --> 01:24:42.494
Oh, son, I'm so sorry.

831
01:24:49.167 --> 01:24:50.168
Hiccup!

832
01:24:56.967 --> 01:24:59.970
He's alive.
You brought him back alive.

833
01:25:16.987 --> 01:25:19.906
Thank you for saving my son.

834
01:25:20.699 --> 01:25:23.702
Well, you know... most of him.

835
01:25:42.012 --> 01:25:43.597
Hey, Toothless.

836
01:25:44.473 --> 01:25:46.725
I'm happy to see you, too.

837
01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:52.481
I'm in my house.

838
01:25:53.607 --> 01:25:55.484
You're in my house.

839
01:25:55.734 --> 01:25:57.402
Does my dad know you're here?

840
01:25:57.569 --> 01:25:59.738
What? OK, OK.

841
01:26:00.238 --> 01:26:02.324
Toothless, no. No, Toothless.

842
01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:04.618
Toothless! Oh, come on.

843
01:26:43.365 --> 01:26:45.867
OK. Thanks, bud.

844
01:26:56.545 --> 01:27:00.090
- Toothless, stay here.
- Come on, guys. Get ready!

845
01:27:00.257 --> 01:27:01.508
Hold on tight! Here we go!

846
01:27:04.761 --> 01:27:05.887
What?

847
01:27:14.146 --> 01:27:16.356
I knew it. I'm dead.

848
01:27:17.482 --> 01:27:21.486
No, but you gave it your best shot.
So, what do you think?

849
01:27:21.653 --> 01:27:23.321
Hey, look, it's Hiccup!

850
01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:25.991
It's Hiccup!

851
01:27:27.826 --> 01:27:31.663
Turns out all we needed
was a little more of this.

852
01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:33.915
You just gestured to all of me.

853
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.128
Well, most of you.
That bit's my handiwork.

854
01:27:38.587 --> 01:27:41.798
With a little Hiccup flair thrown in.
You think it'll do?

855
01:27:42.174 --> 01:27:44.259
I might make a few tweaks.

856
01:27:46.136 --> 01:27:47.971
That's for scaring me.

857
01:27:48.138 --> 01:27:50.682
What is it always going
to be this way? 'Cause...

858
01:27:53.268 --> 01:27:54.811
...I could get used to it.

859
01:27:58.023 --> 01:27:59.858
Welcome home.

860
01:28:00.025 --> 01:28:02.319
- Night Fury!
- Get down!

861
01:28:13.455 --> 01:28:14.456
You ready?

862
01:28:16.583 --> 01:28:19.085
<i>This is Berk.</i>

863
01:28:19.544 --> 01:28:23.340
<i>It snows nine months of the year
and hails the other three.</i>

864
01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:28.637
<i>Any food that grows here
is tough and tasteless.</i>

865
01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:33.308
<i>The people that grow here
are even more so.</i>

866
01:28:37.187 --> 01:28:39.314
<i>The only upsides are the pets.</i>

867
01:28:42.234 --> 01:28:45.987
<i>While other places
have ponies or parrots...</i>

868
01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:48.865
<i>...we have...</i>

869
01:28:49.908 --> 01:28:51.326
<i>...dragons.</i>
