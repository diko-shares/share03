WEBVTT

1
00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:16.409
So we keep heading east?

2
00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:20.079
Yeah, that's the idea.

3
00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:23.291
- Stay out of the big cities?
- Uh-huh.

4
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:29.297
I think I'm tired.

5
00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:31.424
Yeah.

6
00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:33.509
Me too.

7
00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:39.932
Here.

8
00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:43.811
Bring it on up to the office.

9
00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.607
- I'm gonna go check us out.
- All right.

10
00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:13.860
What took you so long?

11
00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:15.611
Nothing.

12
00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:24.287
I had a little trouble with the maid,
but everything's fine now.

13
00:03:31.003 --> 00:03:32.920
Damn.

14
00:03:34.131 --> 00:03:37.800
Eight. It's already this hot.

15
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.635
Yep.

16
00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:42.805
How are we fixed for water?

17
00:03:42.973 --> 00:03:45.099
Probably not enough.

18
00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:47.101
Yeah.

19
00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:58.821
There's a cooler in the back,
in the office.

20
00:05:41.425 --> 00:05:42.842
Hey.

21
00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:58.107
Shh.

22
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.165
Sarah, honey, what's wrong, huh?

23
00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:17.043
What is it, sweetie? Hmm?

24
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.711
- Daddy.
- Yeah?

25
00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:21.797
- Daddy.
- Daddy's here.

26
00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:25.593
- Daddy's here.
- There were monsters.

27
00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:29.305
No, sweetie.
There's no such thing as monsters.

28
00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.557
You were just having a bad dream.

29
00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:33.726
What's wrong, Dad?

30
00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:38.230
Hi, kiddo.
Sarah's just having a bad dream.

31
00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:39.732
Oh.

32
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.817
I saw monsters, Jack.

33
00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:45.404
Aah. Monsters? What kind?

34
00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:48.074
I don't know.
They came out of my closet...

35
00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:49.825
...and then they were in the shadows.

36
00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:52.328
Mm. Shadow monsters.

37
00:06:52.496 --> 00:06:55.623
Well, they look pretty scary,
but they really can't do anything...

38
00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:59.043
...especially when the lights are on.
They're scared of the light.

39
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:00.503
What happened, baby?

40
00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.923
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

41
00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:06.842
Sarah had a bad dream
about monsters.

42
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.720
And I was telling her that
there's no such thing as monsters.

43
00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:11.180
Oh.

44
00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:13.849
I'm going to turn on my night-light
just in case.

45
00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:17.353
That sounds like a brilliant solution.

46
00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:26.946
- Hey, Jack?
- Hey, Mom?

47
00:07:27.114 --> 00:07:28.739
Morning.

48
00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:31.492
Good morning, baby.

49
00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:37.289
Hon, the pickup still won't start.
Mind dropping me off on the way in?

50
00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:38.958
Sure.

51
00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:43.838
- Did you feed Burrow?
- Yeah, I fed him.

52
00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:46.173
Okay. Good.

53
00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:49.385
Night-light worked, didn't it?

54
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.015
I got it, Dad.

55
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:03.065
What do you got going today, Jack?

56
00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:06.152
Uh, nothing much.
A math test in a few days...

57
00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:09.405
...and I think we're playing baseball
in gym class today...

58
00:08:09.573 --> 00:08:12.324
...so I can look forward
to sucking hard in right field.

59
00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:16.495
Well, just remember, don't let
the hitter get the ball over your head.

60
00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:19.081
Unless it's out of the park.

61
00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:21.792
Well, yeah.

62
00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:48.694
Bye.

63
00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:52.364
I get off early today.

64
00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:55.701
All I have is the Watsons' will
and Dave Bryant's tractor sale.

65
00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.953
You want me to pick you up?

66
00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:00.039
Yeah.

67
00:09:00.207 --> 00:09:03.459
Then we can go to the drive-in
and make out tonight.

68
00:09:03.627 --> 00:09:06.879
There hasn't been a drive-in here
since the early '70s, but...

69
00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:12.384
- I love you.
- I love you.

70
00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:15.137
- Have a good one.
- You too.

71
00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:27.942
- Morning.
- Derek.

72
00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:31.111
- Hi, Tom.
- Good morning, Joseph.

73
00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:44.792
It's wild.

74
00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:47.836
- Hey, Tom.
- Morning, Pat.

75
00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:50.005
- Hey, Mick.
- Tom.

76
00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:52.049
Charlotte's gonna be late this morning.

77
00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:54.510
- Was she drunk again?
- Yeah, I guess.

78
00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:58.013
Hey, who's the craziest woman
you ever dated?

79
00:09:58.223 --> 00:09:59.390
- Me?
- Yeah.

80
00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:02.309
Mick and me were talking
about some girls we went with.

81
00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:06.772
He once dated a girl who used
to attack him in the middle of the night.

82
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.275
- She what?
- Yeah.

83
00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:11.527
She used to have
these crazy goddamn dreams...

84
00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:14.488
...where, instead of her boyfriend,
I was a demented killer.

85
00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:17.866
I woke up one night, she stuck
a goddamn fork in my shoulder.

86
00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:20.786
- You're kidding me.
- No.

87
00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:22.705
I'm spurting blood...

88
00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:26.458
...she's sitting there crying,
going, "Baby, I love you, I love you."

89
00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:31.046
So, what happened?
You broke up with her, right?

90
00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:32.965
No, I married her.

91
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.011
Hey, it lasted six years.

92
00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:39.638
Nobody's perfect, Tom.

93
00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:42.016
I guess not.

94
00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:49.565
- Strike this guy out.
- We got them. Let's go.

95
00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:53.027
Yeah.

96
00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:54.987
Two outs.

97
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.244
One winning run
coming right up, boys.

98
00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:04.246
Go, Bobby!

99
00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:05.956
It's all right, brother.

100
00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:10.044
Look alive, look alive.

101
00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:16.467
Let's get them!

102
00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:20.220
- Ball.
- Yeah, that's it.

103
00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:24.600
- He's got nothing. He's got nothing.
- Let's go, let's go. One more. Come on.

104
00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:29.188
- Come on.
- Come on, Bobby.

105
00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:31.607
Yeah. He's yours, he's yours.

106
00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:37.112
- Woo!
- Easy, Jack. Come on, Jack.

107
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.448
- Don't drop it, Jack!
- That's yours.

108
00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:41.408
Jinx, Jackie boy!

109
00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:42.785
Oh.

110
00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:45.079
Game over. Yellows win.

111
00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:48.290
Let's go, guys. Taylor, Dietrich,
you're on equipment. Let's go.

112
00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:54.922
Guys, come on. Let's go.

113
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.299
- Good try, Bobby.
- Thanks a lot, Bobby.

114
00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:59.635
Everyone hit the showers.

115
00:11:59.803 --> 00:12:01.512
- Awesome.
- Nice.

116
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.308
Stall. Good job on that.

117
00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:21.407
Guess you think
you're hot shit, huh, Stall?

118
00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:24.993
What? Uh, no, I don't.

119
00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:28.956
Little hero here, huh?
Little superstar here.

120
00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:31.917
Little hero saves the day
at the last minute, right?

121
00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:36.088
Bobby, it's just a game, okay?
It's just stupid gym class.

122
00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.966
Who you calling stupid?

123
00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:43.095
Ahem. No, I said gym class was stupid.

124
00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:46.598
"No, I said gym class was--"
Listen to this little faggot.

125
00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:50.602
Yeah. You're right.

126
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.273
I'm both little and a faggot.

127
00:12:54.441 --> 00:12:56.650
You got me dead to rights.

128
00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:58.694
Come on, chicken shit, let's do this.

129
00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.030
What would be the point?

130
00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:04.992
I mean, you win. You win, you win.

131
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.203
You've established
your alpha-male standing.

132
00:13:09.038 --> 00:13:12.541
You've established my unworthiness.

133
00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:15.210
But doing violence to me
just seems, ahem...

134
00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:18.088
...pointless and cruel, don't you think?

135
00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:20.215
Let's do this, you punk bitch.

136
00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:24.428
Shouldn't that be "little punk-ass
chicken-shit faggot bitch"?

137
00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:28.891
"Chicken-shit faggot bitch."

138
00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:35.898
God!

139
00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:44.490
Bobby's a chicken shit.

140
00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:07.679
Hey, good-looking.

141
00:14:14.437 --> 00:14:16.605
Where are we going?

142
00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:21.610
Well, Jack's studying
over at Judy Danvers'...

143
00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:25.239
...and Martha's taking care of Sarah.

144
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.534
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

145
00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:33.080
So where we going?

146
00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:39.086
We never got to be teenagers together.

147
00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:41.713
Uh-huh.

148
00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:44.424
I'm gonna fix that.

149
00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:28.677
What's going on in there?

150
00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:31.972
Keep your shirt on. I'm coming.

151
00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:48.488
Holy cow.

152
00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:51.992
What?

153
00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:01.710
Do you need some help with that,
big boy?

154
00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:04.087
Uh...

155
00:16:04.255 --> 00:16:05.839
Maybe.

156
00:16:09.677 --> 00:16:12.304
Oh, my God.

157
00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:24.066
What have you done with my wife?

158
00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:26.568
Ready? Okay!

159
00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:29.738
Go, Wildcats!

160
00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:34.660
No wives in here, mister.

161
00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:42.959
Wow.

162
00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:46.672
Quiet. My parents are
in the next room.

163
00:16:58.226 --> 00:16:59.559
You're naughty.

164
00:17:28.005 --> 00:17:30.340
What are you doing?

165
00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:33.969
Nothing.

166
00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:39.307
You are such a bad boy.

167
00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:40.809
Mm-hm.

168
00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:44.271
Rah-rah-sis-boom-bah.

169
00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:51.987
Oh.

170
00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:56.491
There wasn't much of that
in high school.

171
00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.437
What is it?

172
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.024
Huh?

173
00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:33.695
I remember the moment I knew
you were in love with me.

174
00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:39.409
I saw it in your eyes.

175
00:18:42.497 --> 00:18:45.040
I can still see it.

176
00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:50.045
Of course you can.

177
00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:01.431
I still love you.

178
00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:15.570
I'm the luckiest son of a bitch alive.

179
00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:22.244
You are the best man
I've ever known.

180
00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:25.747
There's no luck involved.

181
00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.720
You wanna go down
and get some food or something?

182
00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:45.433
You ever wonder what kids did for fun
on a Saturday night 100 years ago?

183
00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:48.186
I don't know.

184
00:19:48.354 --> 00:19:50.939
I always figured they got into
their parents' wagon...

185
00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:53.108
...and went cruising up
their main drag...

186
00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:56.570
...playing loud banjo music
and acting like idiots.

187
00:19:58.364 --> 00:20:01.491
So you think this is
as good as it gets?

188
00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:04.870
For us? Yeah.

189
00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:06.705
For now.

190
00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:11.543
Eventually, we grow up,
we get jobs, we have affairs...

191
00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:13.712
...and we become alcoholics.

192
00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:24.514
You know,
sometimes you depress me.

193
00:20:27.935 --> 00:20:29.477
Hey, that's what I'm good at.

194
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.772
All right, give me that.

195
00:20:39.822 --> 00:20:41.573
Give me that.

196
00:20:43.784 --> 00:20:46.453
Hey, isn't that that Stall faggot?

197
00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:48.496
Yeah.

198
00:20:49.332 --> 00:20:51.291
You should go kick his ass.

199
00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:54.002
I'm going to.

200
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.647
Who the fuck was that?

201
00:21:13.814 --> 00:21:16.566
I don't know,
and I don't wanna know.

202
00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:23.615
Can I just say how sick I am
of these Podunk towns...

203
00:21:23.783 --> 00:21:26.534
...and the goddamn Podunks
who live in them?

204
00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:30.205
Do you think if you keep saying that
it's actually gonna change anything?

205
00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:32.207
I am so sick of this shit.

206
00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:36.503
Yeah, you made that clear
about 10,000 miles ago.

207
00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:41.174
Now, if you haven't got a better idea,
I don't wanna hear about it any more.

208
00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:44.135
We are so goddamn broke.

209
00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:47.389
Yeah, well...

210
00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:49.557
...that's easy to fix.

211
00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:53.853
- No way. Uh-uh.
- Come on.

212
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.314
You gonna go shoot pool with Jerry?

213
00:21:56.482 --> 00:21:58.149
- Maybe.
Ha-ha-ha.

214
00:21:58.317 --> 00:22:00.360
- Thanks, Tom.
- Thanks, Mick. Good as ever.

215
00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:03.113
There you go.

216
00:22:04.156 --> 00:22:06.741
- See you in church.
- Yep. Have a good evening.

217
00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:08.743
You too. See you tonight, Charlotte.

218
00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:10.662
Yeah. See you.

219
00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:13.248
Oh, I'm sorry.

220
00:22:13.416 --> 00:22:15.500
It's all right, old fella.

221
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.170
Just closing up, fellas.

222
00:22:24.927 --> 00:22:28.763
- Coffee, black.
- The same.

223
00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:32.267
I'll have some pie.
Some of that lemon meringue pie.

224
00:22:32.435 --> 00:22:36.021
Guys, guys, I'm sorry. We're closed.

225
00:22:37.606 --> 00:22:39.274
I said, coffee!

226
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.613
Okay.

227
00:22:47.491 --> 00:22:50.076
I guess we can handle that.

228
00:22:53.372 --> 00:22:55.749
It's not very fresh.

229
00:23:02.798 --> 00:23:04.299
You can go home now, Charlotte.

230
00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:07.218
Just leave the pie.

231
00:23:08.471 --> 00:23:09.971
Okay.

232
00:23:15.686 --> 00:23:17.687
Billy.

233
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:26.112
You're gonna be sticking around
for a while, honey.

234
00:23:28.324 --> 00:23:29.824
Tom?

235
00:23:33.954 --> 00:23:36.414
Don't fucking move.

236
00:23:46.008 --> 00:23:48.927
Sir, we don't--
We don't carry much cash here.

237
00:23:49.095 --> 00:23:51.346
You gentlemen
are certainly welcome to all of it.

238
00:23:51.514 --> 00:23:53.932
Oh, I know that, asshole, believe me.

239
00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.809
I do know that.

240
00:23:55.976 --> 00:23:57.852
- Aah!
- Shut up, bitch!

241
00:24:02.775 --> 00:24:04.526
Okay, Billy...

242
00:24:04.735 --> 00:24:07.362
...let's show this asshole
we mean business.

243
00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:09.489
What? Her?

244
00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.324
Yes, her.

245
00:24:11.867 --> 00:24:13.993
Do her!

246
00:25:06.714 --> 00:25:09.424
I'm telling you, those men were--
They were gonna kill us.

247
00:25:09.592 --> 00:25:11.009
They were gonna kill us.

248
00:25:11.385 --> 00:25:14.095
And if it weren't for Tom...
He's a hero.

249
00:25:15.014 --> 00:25:17.682
- -In conjunction with
several murders in those states.

250
00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:22.061
Now, Tom Stall is a family man with
long-standing ties to this community.

251
00:25:22.229 --> 00:25:26.566
Tom Stall was just another hard-working
small-business owner and operator...

252
00:25:26.734 --> 00:25:29.027
...in Millbrook, Indiana, but now--

253
00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:34.240
Um, one of the guys had
a gun to my head...

254
00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:37.243
...and Tom-- He was amazing. He--

255
00:25:42.625 --> 00:25:44.542
Hi, baby.

256
00:25:45.461 --> 00:25:47.712
- Hey, honey.
- How you doing?

257
00:25:48.214 --> 00:25:50.423
How are you?

258
00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:55.345
Are you as sick of hearing about me
as I am?

259
00:25:55.763 --> 00:25:58.806
No, I kind of like it.

260
00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:01.559
Look. Your picture's in the paper.

261
00:26:18.994 --> 00:26:20.745
Oh, God.

262
00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:22.997
Careful.

263
00:26:27.378 --> 00:26:29.796
- Hi, guys.
- Mom.

264
00:26:29.964 --> 00:26:32.674
Can I-- Can I get up now?

265
00:26:33.133 --> 00:26:34.676
- You got it, Dad?
- Yeah.

266
00:26:34.843 --> 00:26:38.179
- Way to go, Tommy.
- We're all here for you, Tom.

267
00:26:39.556 --> 00:26:41.140
- Way to go, Tom.
- Hi, sweetie.

268
00:26:41.308 --> 00:26:43.810
Oh, that's so nice.

269
00:26:44.436 --> 00:26:47.689
Thank you so much for coming.

270
00:26:49.692 --> 00:26:53.528
We're in Millbrook, just outside the home
of American hero Tom Stall...

271
00:26:53.696 --> 00:26:57.615
...who's just now returning
from the hospital with his family.

272
00:27:00.452 --> 00:27:03.204
Mr. Stall, Jenny Wyeth, WRPK News.

273
00:27:03.414 --> 00:27:04.998
I have a few questions for you.

274
00:27:05.165 --> 00:27:09.544
How did it feel when you saw the guns
of those ruthless killers pointed at you?

275
00:27:09.712 --> 00:27:12.380
- How'd it feel?
- Yeah.

276
00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:19.679
Not very good.

277
00:27:19.847 --> 00:27:23.266
Were you surprised, though,
by your own reaction to the situation?

278
00:27:23.434 --> 00:27:24.892
Uh...

279
00:27:25.644 --> 00:27:27.186
What I did was...

280
00:27:27.354 --> 00:27:30.398
I mean, anybody would have
done that.

281
00:27:30.566 --> 00:27:33.693
It was just a terrible thing.

282
00:27:33.861 --> 00:27:36.738
I think we'll all be better off
when we get past it.

283
00:27:36.947 --> 00:27:39.032
But you really went
beyond what the average--

284
00:27:39.199 --> 00:27:41.909
I need to--
I really need to be with my family.

285
00:27:42.077 --> 00:27:43.578
Thanks.

286
00:27:45.122 --> 00:27:48.124
I'm Jenny Wyeth in Millbrook,
and that was Tom Stall.

287
00:27:48.292 --> 00:27:51.753
American hero, man of few words.

288
00:27:53.088 --> 00:27:55.340
Well, I guess that's
all we're gonna get.

289
00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.638
Man, it's good to be home.

290
00:28:02.806 --> 00:28:05.516
I hope there won't be
too much more of that.

291
00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:12.732
Dad, they all just wanna
interview you because of what you did.

292
00:28:14.109 --> 00:28:16.778
You're a hero, Dad. Ha, ha.

293
00:28:16.945 --> 00:28:18.905
No, I'm not.

294
00:28:19.073 --> 00:28:20.907
I just got lucky. Very lucky.

295
00:28:21.075 --> 00:28:24.118
This will all blow over as soon as
they find some other hot story.

296
00:28:24.286 --> 00:28:27.789
Yeah. Maybe the Lydons
will have another two-headed cow.

297
00:28:27.998 --> 00:28:29.749
You guys aren't thinking big enough.

298
00:28:29.917 --> 00:28:32.043
You could probably do
Larry King Live, Dad.

299
00:28:32.211 --> 00:28:34.462
- Oh, you stop it. Stop it.
- That would be cool.

300
00:28:36.006 --> 00:28:37.548
Look at this. More reporters.

301
00:28:39.134 --> 00:28:40.426
Are they still there?

302
00:28:40.803 --> 00:28:44.472
Yeah, there's some car parked across
the road. They're just sitting there.

303
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.766
- Does anyone want some tea?
- I'll take some.

304
00:28:46.934 --> 00:28:48.601
Yes, please.

305
00:28:50.145 --> 00:28:52.063
Jeez.

306
00:29:10.833 --> 00:29:13.334
- Hey, Edie.
- Hi. How are you?

307
00:29:13.502 --> 00:29:14.961
- Gonna go to the shop?
- Sure.

308
00:29:15.421 --> 00:29:17.672
Hello. Hey, Bill.

309
00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.173
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, baby.

310
00:29:19.341 --> 00:29:22.969
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm all right. What brings you by?

311
00:29:23.137 --> 00:29:24.679
Wanted to see how you were doing.

312
00:29:24.847 --> 00:29:27.181
Doing good. Business is great.
Just can't keep up.

313
00:29:27.349 --> 00:29:29.517
Yeah, it's busy.

314
00:29:29.685 --> 00:29:32.770
Oh, look, more reporters. Nice.

315
00:29:33.814 --> 00:29:36.482
They don't look like reporters.

316
00:29:37.359 --> 00:29:39.735
Grilled cheese is ready.

317
00:29:39.903 --> 00:29:43.448
Got, uh, fries and a strawberry shake.

318
00:29:46.076 --> 00:29:48.202
Hello. Welcome to Stall's.

319
00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:50.872
Would you gentlemen
like some coffee?

320
00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:52.123
You're the hero.

321
00:29:54.126 --> 00:29:56.961
- I don't know, sir. I was just--
- No, you're the big hero.

322
00:29:57.671 --> 00:30:00.298
You sure took care
of those two bad men.

323
00:30:01.383 --> 00:30:04.218
I really don't like talking about it, sir.

324
00:30:04.386 --> 00:30:06.345
We're trying to get back
to normal here.

325
00:30:06.513 --> 00:30:08.431
So can I offer you gentlemen
some coffee?

326
00:30:08.599 --> 00:30:11.142
Sure. Give me some coffee.
Make it black...

327
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:13.603
- Yes, sir.
- ...Joey.

328
00:30:16.023 --> 00:30:18.232
And, uh...? And your friends?

329
00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:23.070
They don't drink coffee.
It doesn't agree with them...

330
00:30:23.322 --> 00:30:24.906
...Joey.

331
00:30:26.116 --> 00:30:28.326
- Who's Joey?
- You are.

332
00:30:32.164 --> 00:30:34.999
- My name's Tom, sir.
- Of course it is.

333
00:30:42.591 --> 00:30:45.426
Mm. That's good coffee.

334
00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:48.012
Thank you, sir.

335
00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:51.557
Hard to find coffee this good
in Philadelphia.

336
00:30:51.725 --> 00:30:53.935
But you know that, don't you, Tom?

337
00:30:57.564 --> 00:31:01.609
No, actually, I don't.
I've never been to Philadelphia.

338
00:31:01.777 --> 00:31:04.195
Pennsylvania?
Is that where you gentlemen are from?

339
00:31:04.363 --> 00:31:06.614
Yeah, like you don't know.

340
00:31:08.534 --> 00:31:11.118
I'm sorry. Do--?
Did we know each other?

341
00:31:21.463 --> 00:31:23.422
You tell me.

342
00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.467
No.

343
00:31:26.635 --> 00:31:29.303
- We don't know each other.
- Come on, Joey. Cut the crap.

344
00:31:29.721 --> 00:31:31.138
My name is Tom.

345
00:31:31.306 --> 00:31:35.810
Joey Cusack. Your name is Joey Cusack.

346
00:31:35.978 --> 00:31:37.687
You're from Philly.

347
00:31:40.691 --> 00:31:42.608
Okay. Whatever.

348
00:31:45.112 --> 00:31:47.822
Excuse me, gentlemen.
If you're not gonna order anything...

349
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:50.199
...we'd appreciate it
if you'd be on your way.

350
00:31:50.367 --> 00:31:52.660
We ate on the road.

351
00:31:53.203 --> 00:31:54.662
It's all right.

352
00:31:55.289 --> 00:31:56.956
It's okay.

353
00:31:57.124 --> 00:32:01.627
We really are very busy here today,
as you can see.

354
00:32:01.837 --> 00:32:05.464
Um, so if you gentlemen
aren't gonna be eating...

355
00:32:05.632 --> 00:32:08.968
...I really should offer your seats
to paying customers.

356
00:32:09.511 --> 00:32:10.970
Huh.

357
00:32:12.723 --> 00:32:14.640
Well...

358
00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:19.937
...now we're paying customers.

359
00:32:22.024 --> 00:32:24.817
- I can't take this.
- It shouldn't be a problem for you.

360
00:32:25.152 --> 00:32:26.611
What is that supposed to mean?

361
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:29.614
Mr. Fogarty's
just making conversation here.

362
00:32:30.198 --> 00:32:32.783
Whatever you wanna call it,
this conversation is over.

363
00:32:33.619 --> 00:32:35.703
I think he wants us to leave,
Mr. Fogarty.

364
00:32:35.871 --> 00:32:38.205
You know what he does
when he don't like people?

365
00:32:38.373 --> 00:32:40.333
Yeah. I'm scared.

366
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.793
We should leave
before he goes all Dirty Harry on us.

367
00:32:45.839 --> 00:32:48.466
I wanna thank you for the coffee, Joey.

368
00:32:48.634 --> 00:32:50.926
It really is very good.

369
00:32:51.094 --> 00:32:53.846
It's Tom. My name's Tom Stall.

370
00:33:10.405 --> 00:33:12.239
Excuse me.

371
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:18.371
What are you doing?
Who are you calling?

372
00:33:18.538 --> 00:33:21.582
Hi, Molly. This is Edie Stall. ls he in?

373
00:33:21.792 --> 00:33:23.000
I'm fine, thanks.

374
00:33:23.418 --> 00:33:26.170
- You're calling Sam?
- Yes.

375
00:34:01.123 --> 00:34:04.291
Is there a problem
with my driving, officer?

376
00:34:04.459 --> 00:34:06.419
Can I see your license, sir?

377
00:34:06.586 --> 00:34:08.546
Sure.

378
00:34:12.843 --> 00:34:14.969
I thought I was under the limit.

379
00:34:17.597 --> 00:34:19.765
Is there some problem
I should know about?

380
00:34:20.892 --> 00:34:22.810
What's your business in Millbrook, sir?

381
00:34:22.978 --> 00:34:24.603
We're tourists.

382
00:34:25.981 --> 00:34:28.816
And what business did you have
at Stall's Diner today?

383
00:34:29.234 --> 00:34:31.068
We heard the coffee was terrific.

384
00:34:32.237 --> 00:34:35.322
Let me make something clear to you...

385
00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:36.741
...and to Mr. Mulligan.

386
00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:38.242
Uh-huh?

387
00:34:39.161 --> 00:34:41.287
This is a nice town.

388
00:34:41.455 --> 00:34:43.789
We have nice people here.

389
00:34:43.957 --> 00:34:46.584
We take care of our nice people.

390
00:34:46.752 --> 00:34:48.502
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah, sure.

391
00:34:50.172 --> 00:34:52.465
Don't let me see you around again.

392
00:34:52.632 --> 00:34:54.592
You keep up the good work, officer.

393
00:35:09.191 --> 00:35:10.983
Charles Roarke, Philadelphia.

394
00:35:11.151 --> 00:35:13.944
Indicted on three counts of murder.

395
00:35:15.197 --> 00:35:17.490
Frank Mulligan, out of New York.

396
00:35:17.657 --> 00:35:20.034
Indicted on one count of murder...

397
00:35:20.202 --> 00:35:23.996
...questioned in relation to
dozens of acts of violence...

398
00:35:24.164 --> 00:35:26.665
...that you don't wanna hear about.

399
00:35:27.334 --> 00:35:29.752
Both men work for Carl Fogarty.

400
00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.420
He's the fella with the eye.

401
00:35:31.797 --> 00:35:34.715
He spent 15 years in prison
on several counts of assault.

402
00:35:34.925 --> 00:35:38.135
He's suspected
in half a dozen murders...

403
00:35:38.303 --> 00:35:40.471
...and more disappearances.

404
00:35:40.639 --> 00:35:44.642
Tom, these guys are organized crime
from the East Coast.

405
00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:47.478
Now, they're the real thing.
They're bad men.

406
00:35:48.647 --> 00:35:51.065
Jesus. Jesus, honey.

407
00:35:53.026 --> 00:35:55.820
Look, I have to ask you a question.

408
00:35:59.241 --> 00:36:02.243
Are you in some kind of
witness-protection plan?

409
00:36:02.619 --> 00:36:04.954
- Sam.
- Some kind of what?

410
00:36:05.413 --> 00:36:09.250
- This is no laughing matter, Edie.
- Of course he's not, Sam.

411
00:36:09.417 --> 00:36:12.545
I'd just like to hear Tom say that.

412
00:36:17.926 --> 00:36:22.596
Okay. No. No,
I'm not in a witness program.

413
00:36:22.848 --> 00:36:24.765
Those men just have the wrong guy.

414
00:36:24.975 --> 00:36:27.393
They must've seen me on TV,
and I guess...

415
00:36:27.561 --> 00:36:29.270
...I reminded them
of this Johnny guy.

416
00:36:29.437 --> 00:36:31.605
- Joey.
- Joey somebody.

417
00:36:31.773 --> 00:36:34.650
I mean, good Lord. The idea of me--

418
00:36:34.818 --> 00:36:38.070
I never honestly believed it,
but I had to ask.

419
00:36:39.406 --> 00:36:43.534
I've done some research
on this Joey Cusack.

420
00:36:43.702 --> 00:36:45.578
I didn't find anything.

421
00:36:46.037 --> 00:36:49.707
But there is a Richie Cusack
in Philadelphia.

422
00:36:49.875 --> 00:36:51.625
Apparently, he's the head...

423
00:36:51.793 --> 00:36:55.629
...of some kind of crime syndicate
in that city.

424
00:36:55.797 --> 00:36:59.133
Men like this come to our town
and start harassing a citizen...

425
00:36:59.301 --> 00:37:00.968
...we have to take them seriously.

426
00:37:01.136 --> 00:37:02.636
Sure.

427
00:37:03.889 --> 00:37:07.766
All right. So if you folks see them
coming around, you let me know.

428
00:37:08.894 --> 00:37:10.644
Will do.

429
00:37:10.979 --> 00:37:13.564
I'm sorry, Sam. Do you want
a piece of pie or something?

430
00:37:13.732 --> 00:37:15.024
No, thanks, Edie.

431
00:37:15.191 --> 00:37:17.693
I'd love to,
but I gotta get back to work.

432
00:37:17.861 --> 00:37:19.528
Thank you. Thanks for coming.

433
00:37:20.447 --> 00:37:22.615
Sam? Thank you.

434
00:37:22.782 --> 00:37:25.409
It's good to know
you're watching out for us.

435
00:37:25.744 --> 00:37:27.411
Come on, Tom.

436
00:37:27.579 --> 00:37:29.622
You know we look out
for our own here.

437
00:37:30.457 --> 00:37:32.833
- Good night.
- Good night.

438
00:37:33.668 --> 00:37:35.169
See you. Thanks.

439
00:37:51.186 --> 00:37:53.270
Don't worry.

440
00:37:54.606 --> 00:37:56.690
They're as good as gone.

441
00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:06.325
Sorry. Sorry.

442
00:38:10.372 --> 00:38:12.623
It's over and done with.

443
00:38:16.544 --> 00:38:18.379
Okay.

444
00:39:19.941 --> 00:39:21.442
Honey. Can you get that, hon?

445
00:39:21.901 --> 00:39:23.694
Come on, come on!

446
00:39:27.699 --> 00:39:28.741
Hello?

447
00:39:28.908 --> 00:39:30.659
The shotgun, Edie. Get the shotgun.

448
00:39:30.827 --> 00:39:32.119
Tom, Tom, what's wrong?

449
00:39:32.287 --> 00:39:34.955
- They're coming to the house.
- Who's coming to the house?

450
00:39:35.123 --> 00:39:36.623
Just grab it! Do it and be ready.

451
00:39:36.791 --> 00:39:40.044
- Okay, stop. Are you serious?
- I'll be there as soon as I can.

452
00:39:44.966 --> 00:39:46.467
Shit.

453
00:39:57.187 --> 00:39:58.896
Come on.

454
00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.196
Oh, shit.

455
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:09.990
Oh, come on.

456
00:40:17.749 --> 00:40:18.957
Come on.

457
00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:45.317
Fuck. Tom!

458
00:40:47.403 --> 00:40:51.949
Tom. Tom, what's going on? Huh?

459
00:40:52.117 --> 00:40:53.367
I don't know, baby.

460
00:40:53.952 --> 00:40:55.536
Jesus.

461
00:40:56.454 --> 00:40:57.788
What's going on?

462
00:40:58.498 --> 00:41:01.041
I don't-- I don't know. Ugh.

463
00:41:02.168 --> 00:41:03.502
Let me call Sam, all right?

464
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:06.046
- No, don't.
- Okay.

465
00:41:06.214 --> 00:41:08.507
I-- I don't even know--

466
00:41:08.675 --> 00:41:11.552
- I don't know why I thought--
- What?

467
00:41:12.512 --> 00:41:14.054
- All right.
- Mom?

468
00:41:14.389 --> 00:41:16.348
It's okay, baby.

469
00:41:22.522 --> 00:41:23.897
Yeah.

470
00:41:29.195 --> 00:41:30.779
I think I'm losing my mind.

471
00:41:30.947 --> 00:41:33.282
No, no, no. Okay.
You're not losing your mind.

472
00:41:33.449 --> 00:41:35.909
You've been through
some serious trauma. All right?

473
00:41:36.077 --> 00:41:38.370
I'm here for you, baby.
We're all here for you.

474
00:41:38.538 --> 00:41:40.414
It's all right. It's gonna be okay.

475
00:41:40.582 --> 00:41:44.501
Mom? You haven't forgotten
about our new shoes, have you?

476
00:41:44.669 --> 00:41:47.045
Gosh, no.
It's my top priority for the day.

477
00:41:47.213 --> 00:41:49.756
- How could I forget? You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

478
00:41:49.924 --> 00:41:51.341
Hi. Hi, sweetie.

479
00:41:51.968 --> 00:41:54.928
Get ready for school.
I'll speak to you afterwards, all right?

480
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:57.181
Okay.

481
00:41:58.183 --> 00:42:00.392
Come on.

482
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.519
Let's go shopping.

483
00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:20.329
Hey.

484
00:42:20.705 --> 00:42:22.789
Careful, it's loaded.

485
00:42:34.844 --> 00:42:37.721
Why was Mom running
around the house with that?

486
00:42:38.848 --> 00:42:40.390
What's going on, Dad?

487
00:42:40.975 --> 00:42:42.935
False alarm.

488
00:42:43.519 --> 00:42:45.646
Nothing to worry about.

489
00:42:46.814 --> 00:42:48.482
I am worried.

490
00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:51.485
You're sweating. You're soaked, Dad.

491
00:42:51.653 --> 00:42:53.153
What kind of false alarm?

492
00:42:53.321 --> 00:42:56.073
What did you mean,
you think you're losing your mind?

493
00:42:58.243 --> 00:43:00.994
Some Mob guys
showed up at the diner.

494
00:43:02.247 --> 00:43:04.206
They saw me on TV...

495
00:43:04.374 --> 00:43:06.792
...and they came by
to take a look at me.

496
00:43:07.543 --> 00:43:11.672
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that. So...

497
00:43:11.923 --> 00:43:13.966
They thought they knew me.

498
00:43:15.677 --> 00:43:17.302
They thought...

499
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:19.137
...I was somebody else.

500
00:43:19.639 --> 00:43:20.973
That's weird.

501
00:43:21.182 --> 00:43:24.268
Yeah. Weird.

502
00:43:24.686 --> 00:43:26.812
Yeah, and I guess...

503
00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:30.691
Well, I guess they don't like this guy
they think you are.

504
00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:34.861
- Apparently not.
- And...

505
00:43:35.029 --> 00:43:36.947
And I guess I--

506
00:43:37.115 --> 00:43:38.532
I guess--

507
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.201
I guess they wanna kill this guy
they think you are?

508
00:43:42.412 --> 00:43:44.705
See, that's the "losing my mind" part.

509
00:43:44.872 --> 00:43:47.708
I mean, I have no reason to think that.

510
00:43:48.084 --> 00:43:49.334
I was just...

511
00:43:49.502 --> 00:43:52.838
...down at work, and, you know,
suddenly I thought maybe--

512
00:43:53.715 --> 00:43:55.799
Maybe...

513
00:43:56.551 --> 00:43:59.011
...they'd come looking around.

514
00:43:59.178 --> 00:44:00.637
You know?

515
00:44:03.057 --> 00:44:04.808
And, uh...

516
00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.353
And you came running
back here to save us?

517
00:44:09.105 --> 00:44:12.024
Yeah, something silly like that.

518
00:44:13.693 --> 00:44:15.402
I'm sorry.

519
00:44:16.446 --> 00:44:18.322
What if you're right?

520
00:44:22.618 --> 00:44:24.745
Then we deal with it.

521
00:44:58.988 --> 00:45:00.364
Come with me.

522
00:45:15.797 --> 00:45:17.130
Now look what I just found.

523
00:45:17.298 --> 00:45:20.217
It's my last pair in this style
and it's exactly your size.

524
00:45:20.385 --> 00:45:23.303
Just try these on.
They should fit like a dream.

525
00:45:24.347 --> 00:45:26.932
- How do they feel?
- Good.

526
00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:28.308
Yeah, I think I like them.

527
00:45:28.476 --> 00:45:31.478
- I have a pair of these.
- They look great and they really last.

528
00:45:31.646 --> 00:45:34.064
Really? Okay. I'll take them.

529
00:45:34.232 --> 00:45:36.983
And I need a new pair
for her as well.

530
00:45:38.319 --> 00:45:39.919
Sarah?

531
00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:47.119
- Ma'am--
- I have to find my daughter.

532
00:45:47.286 --> 00:45:50.747
- I can't let you leave with the shoes.
- Okay, okay, okay. Sarah!

533
00:45:52.542 --> 00:45:54.142
Sarah?

534
00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.852
Sarah. Sarah.

535
00:46:12.061 --> 00:46:14.855
- Don't ever do that again, okay?
- I'm sorry, Mommy.

536
00:46:15.022 --> 00:46:17.023
But look.
They have the new Vespa dolls.

537
00:46:17.191 --> 00:46:20.610
Nothing to worry about, Mrs. Stall.
I've been watching over her.

538
00:46:20.778 --> 00:46:23.655
You stay the fuck away from my family,
you son of a bitch.

539
00:46:23.823 --> 00:46:27.659
There's no need for
that kind of language, Mrs. Stall.

540
00:46:28.286 --> 00:46:31.204
Listen. I don't know what you want
and I don't really care.

541
00:46:31.497 --> 00:46:33.707
You should care about
what I want, Mrs. Stall...

542
00:46:33.875 --> 00:46:36.084
...because I want something
from your husband...

543
00:46:36.252 --> 00:46:40.297
...that might affect you.
It might change your life.

544
00:46:40.506 --> 00:46:42.674
My husband does not know you.

545
00:46:42.842 --> 00:46:44.718
He wouldn't know you,
somebody like you.

546
00:46:44.886 --> 00:46:48.221
Oh, he knows Carl Fogarty, all right.

547
00:46:48.389 --> 00:46:50.724
He knows me intimately.

548
00:46:51.476 --> 00:46:55.854
See? This isn't a completely dead eye.

549
00:46:56.022 --> 00:46:58.565
It still works a bit.

550
00:46:58.733 --> 00:47:01.902
The problem is, the only thing
I can see with it is Joey Cusack.

551
00:47:03.154 --> 00:47:05.697
And it can see right through him.

552
00:47:05.907 --> 00:47:08.492
Right through your husband, Edie.

553
00:47:08.659 --> 00:47:12.162
See what's inside him,
what makes him tick.

554
00:47:12.705 --> 00:47:15.332
- He's still the same guy.
- No.

555
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.418
He's still crazy fucking Joey.

556
00:47:18.586 --> 00:47:20.212
And you know it, don't you?

557
00:47:21.422 --> 00:47:23.757
I know my husband is Tom Stall.
That's what I know.

558
00:47:23.925 --> 00:47:25.258
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

559
00:47:25.426 --> 00:47:28.470
Well, why don't you ask Tom
about his older brother Richie?

560
00:47:28.638 --> 00:47:33.350
Ask Tom about how he tried
to rip my eye out with barbed wire.

561
00:47:34.268 --> 00:47:36.353
And ask him, Edie...

562
00:47:36.521 --> 00:47:41.566
...how come he's so good
at killing people?

563
00:47:42.235 --> 00:47:45.570
If I see you within 500 feet of me...

564
00:47:45.738 --> 00:47:47.948
...or my children or my husband,
I'll have you arrested.

565
00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:52.118
Can I possibly make myself
any clearer than that?

566
00:47:52.286 --> 00:47:56.248
No, no, Mrs. Stall, you can't.
I thank you for your time.

567
00:47:56.415 --> 00:47:58.875
You have an enchanting daughter.

568
00:48:00.378 --> 00:48:02.462
And, Mrs. Stall...

569
00:48:02.672 --> 00:48:04.673
...don't forget your shoes.

570
00:48:07.677 --> 00:48:09.177
So how's your dad?

571
00:48:09.345 --> 00:48:11.471
Oh, I don't know. A little weird.

572
00:48:11.639 --> 00:48:16.142
Well, after what he went through?
I mean, actually killing someone?

573
00:48:16.310 --> 00:48:19.479
I mean, that's enough
to freak anybody out.

574
00:48:19.647 --> 00:48:21.982
Yeah. I guess.

575
00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:27.737
So your old man's
some kind of tough guy, huh?

576
00:48:28.698 --> 00:48:30.323
What's he think of his wimp son?

577
00:48:30.491 --> 00:48:33.243
You think he'd take this shit?
You think he'd make jokes?

578
00:48:33.411 --> 00:48:35.287
Go on, bitch. Say something funny.

579
00:48:35.913 --> 00:48:39.332
- Bobby, leave him alone.
- Shut up, skank.

580
00:48:40.001 --> 00:48:43.003
Uh-oh. He's getting mad.

581
00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:45.005
Jack, let's just get out of here, okay?

582
00:48:46.924 --> 00:48:48.842
Jack, he's an asshole. You know that.

583
00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.595
He doesn't mean shit. Let's just go.

584
00:48:51.762 --> 00:48:54.347
- Let's just get out of here, okay?
- Yeah, puss.

585
00:48:55.433 --> 00:48:56.850
Run away.

586
00:48:57.018 --> 00:48:59.811
Goddamn, I bet your dad
would be real shamed by you.

587
00:49:01.355 --> 00:49:03.148
Go ahead, bitch. Say something funny.

588
00:49:03.983 --> 00:49:05.859
Make me laugh.

589
00:49:25.713 --> 00:49:27.255
Okay, you motherfucker!

590
00:49:27.423 --> 00:49:30.634
Get over there,
you little son of a bitch!

591
00:49:32.136 --> 00:49:35.221
Come here. Are you laughing?
Are you laughing now...

592
00:49:35.389 --> 00:49:39.684
...you motherfucking
cock-sucking piece of shit?!

593
00:49:45.733 --> 00:49:47.817
What the hell were you thinking?

594
00:49:47.985 --> 00:49:50.320
- I wasn't thinking.
- Obviously not.

595
00:49:50.988 --> 00:49:53.907
Bobby's been riding me all year, Dad.
He's a jerk.

596
00:49:55.326 --> 00:49:58.411
- He's a jerk?
- Yeah. He's a jerk.

597
00:49:58.579 --> 00:50:00.330
That's no excuse.

598
00:50:00.539 --> 00:50:02.874
Stand up to him.
You don't put him in the hospital.

599
00:50:03.042 --> 00:50:06.836
Oh, big deal. It's the best thing
anyone could've done to him.

600
00:50:07.046 --> 00:50:08.672
Besides, I only got suspended.

601
00:50:08.881 --> 00:50:12.342
It is a big deal.
His parents say they might sue us.

602
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:14.219
There could be assault charges.

603
00:50:14.595 --> 00:50:16.930
We can't afford that.
We don't have the money.

604
00:50:17.098 --> 00:50:19.599
Oh, what?
Mom's not gonna take the case?

605
00:50:19.767 --> 00:50:21.893
- Oh, whatever, Dad--
- Listen, smart mouth!

606
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:26.272
In this family, we do not solve
our problems by hitting people!

607
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.608
No, in this family, we shoot them!

608
00:50:36.325 --> 00:50:37.909
Jack.

609
00:50:48.587 --> 00:50:50.964
Honey, have you seen Jack?

610
00:50:54.969 --> 00:50:56.219
What?

611
00:50:57.805 --> 00:50:59.973
What's wrong, baby?

612
00:51:03.602 --> 00:51:06.146
Fogarty and his men
followed us to the mall.

613
00:51:06.397 --> 00:51:07.647
He what?

614
00:51:10.359 --> 00:51:12.944
Call Sam. Should we call Sam?

615
00:51:13.112 --> 00:51:16.114
- We should call--
- I already took care of it, honey.

616
00:51:16.282 --> 00:51:19.743
I went down to the courthouse,
got a restraining order.

617
00:51:20.327 --> 00:51:21.828
A lot of good that'll do.

618
00:51:22.496 --> 00:51:24.581
Well, it's something.

619
00:51:25.666 --> 00:51:29.169
At least we can have him arrested
if he ever comes around here again.

620
00:51:31.756 --> 00:51:33.631
You're right.

621
00:51:36.385 --> 00:51:37.969
But I have to tell you something.

622
00:51:40.431 --> 00:51:41.848
What?

623
00:51:42.683 --> 00:51:45.727
This man Fogarty really believes...

624
00:51:45.895 --> 00:51:48.480
...that you're this Joey Cusack.

625
00:51:50.524 --> 00:51:53.276
I mean, the things that he told me
this afternoon--

626
00:51:53.444 --> 00:51:55.779
- What things?
- Things. Just bullshit.

627
00:51:57.031 --> 00:52:01.326
But he's... He's sure that it's you.

628
00:52:01.869 --> 00:52:03.953
And we have to convince him
that it's not.

629
00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:09.000
Well, I don't think he's interested
in examining my DNA.

630
00:52:30.356 --> 00:52:33.066
- Get off our property.
- We'll go, Joey.

631
00:52:33.609 --> 00:52:35.485
We just want you to come with us.

632
00:52:35.653 --> 00:52:38.321
Come back to Philly, see some people.

633
00:52:39.031 --> 00:52:41.533
I told you, I have never been
to Philadelphia.

634
00:52:42.368 --> 00:52:44.869
You almost believe
your own crap, don't you?

635
00:52:45.037 --> 00:52:48.248
You know, you're trying so hard
to be this other guy.

636
00:52:48.499 --> 00:52:50.834
It's painful to watch.

637
00:52:52.795 --> 00:52:54.504
- Charlie.
- Hey.

638
00:52:55.381 --> 00:52:57.257
Look what we found.

639
00:52:57.424 --> 00:53:00.343
Come on. Eh? Ha.

640
00:53:00.553 --> 00:53:01.845
- Mom!
- Jack!

641
00:53:02.012 --> 00:53:03.930
- No! Edie! Edie!
- Mom!

642
00:53:04.098 --> 00:53:06.266
- Edie! No! No!
- Jack!

643
00:53:06.767 --> 00:53:10.270
- Let me go, you son of a bitch!
- Come here.

644
00:53:11.689 --> 00:53:12.897
Wait.

645
00:53:14.149 --> 00:53:15.859
Mom.

646
00:53:16.902 --> 00:53:18.611
Don't make us hurt the kid, Joey.

647
00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:22.574
We just want you to come for
a little trip with us down memory lane.

648
00:53:23.784 --> 00:53:26.119
Put the popgun down,
come over and talk to us.

649
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:28.246
- My baby.
- Wait.

650
00:53:28.414 --> 00:53:31.499
Edie, I will get him.

651
00:53:31.959 --> 00:53:34.460
I'll get him. Please.

652
00:53:34.628 --> 00:53:36.087
Go up to Sarah.

653
00:53:36.255 --> 00:53:39.299
Go up to her. Do it.

654
00:53:47.766 --> 00:53:49.225
Put the gun down.

655
00:53:54.982 --> 00:53:57.150
Put it down, Joey.

656
00:54:02.573 --> 00:54:04.407
Come closer.

657
00:54:10.289 --> 00:54:12.332
A little further.

658
00:54:18.839 --> 00:54:20.673
Come on.

659
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:36.689
Go back to the house, Jack.

660
00:54:41.028 --> 00:54:42.195
Go on.

661
00:54:53.082 --> 00:54:56.793
You see how cozy it can be
when you decide to play nice?

662
00:54:58.087 --> 00:55:00.463
Now, come on, Joey. Get in the car.

663
00:55:00.631 --> 00:55:03.591
You won't need your toothbrush.
We'll take care of everything.

664
00:55:04.343 --> 00:55:06.844
I think it'd be better
if you'd just leave now.

665
00:55:12.768 --> 00:55:14.477
Joey.

666
00:55:25.155 --> 00:55:27.240
Come on, Joey, let's go.

667
00:55:41.922 --> 00:55:43.506
Tom!

668
00:55:49.346 --> 00:55:50.430
Fuck.

669
00:55:53.308 --> 00:55:54.517
Mommy, what's wrong?

670
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:05.403
It's okay.

671
00:56:09.908 --> 00:56:13.745
You got anything to say before I blow
your brains out, you miserable prick?

672
00:56:16.457 --> 00:56:19.375
I should've killed you back in Philly.

673
00:56:24.757 --> 00:56:26.758
Yeah, Joey...

674
00:56:27.718 --> 00:56:29.260
...you should have.

675
00:58:10.529 --> 00:58:12.196
Edie.

676
00:58:19.204 --> 00:58:20.538
Honey, are you okay?

677
00:58:23.083 --> 00:58:24.500
Tell me the truth.

678
00:58:27.838 --> 00:58:29.589
The truth?

679
00:58:32.676 --> 00:58:35.595
Please. You can do that, can't you?

680
00:58:39.057 --> 00:58:42.226
You can do that, can't you? Please?

681
00:58:42.728 --> 00:58:44.312
What do you think you heard?

682
00:58:44.771 --> 00:58:47.190
It's not what I heard...

683
00:58:47.608 --> 00:58:48.941
...it's what I saw.

684
00:58:53.447 --> 00:58:55.364
I saw Joey.

685
00:58:56.450 --> 00:59:00.703
I saw you turn into Joey
right before my eyes.

686
00:59:01.705 --> 00:59:05.583
I saw a killer,
the one Fogarty warned me about.

687
00:59:06.585 --> 00:59:10.421
You did kill men
back in Philly, didn't you?

688
00:59:13.091 --> 00:59:16.093
Did you do it for money
or did you do it because you enjoyed it?

689
00:59:16.261 --> 00:59:19.764
Joey did, both. I didn't--

690
00:59:20.098 --> 00:59:21.307
Tom Stall didn't.

691
00:59:28.815 --> 00:59:30.399
Oh, God.

692
00:59:31.318 --> 00:59:33.236
Oh, my God.

693
00:59:43.872 --> 00:59:46.374
Oh, God, it's really happening.

694
00:59:49.461 --> 00:59:52.964
What are you, like,
some multiple-personality schizoid?

695
00:59:53.173 --> 00:59:55.675
It's like flipping a switch
back and forth for you?

696
00:59:55.884 --> 00:59:58.469
I never expected to see Joey again.

697
00:59:58.637 --> 01:00:01.264
Oh, yeah. Joey.

698
01:00:01.682 --> 01:00:03.391
What, was he in hiding? Was he dead?

699
01:00:03.558 --> 01:00:06.852
I thought he was.
I thought I killed Joey Cusack.

700
01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.855
- I went out to the desert and I killed him.
- Oh, my God.

701
01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:14.193
I spent three years becoming Tom Stall.

702
01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:17.113
Edie, you have to know this.

703
01:00:17.281 --> 01:00:20.449
I wasn't really born again until I met you.

704
01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:23.536
I was nothing.

705
01:00:26.164 --> 01:00:28.541
I don't believe you.

706
01:00:30.168 --> 01:00:33.504
I can't believe this is happening.
I can't believe this is happening.

707
01:00:33.672 --> 01:00:37.216
I can't believe
this is fucking happening!

708
01:00:39.177 --> 01:00:42.138
You didn't grow up in Portland.

709
01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:45.474
And you never talk about
your adopted parents...

710
01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:47.727
...because you don't have any!

711
01:00:49.396 --> 01:00:53.566
And our name. Jesus Christ, my name.

712
01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:56.694
Jack's name. Sarah's name?

713
01:00:56.862 --> 01:01:00.990
Stall? Tom Stall?

714
01:01:02.701 --> 01:01:04.994
Did you just make that up?

715
01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:07.955
Where did that name come from?

716
01:01:09.583 --> 01:01:11.667
I mean...

717
01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:15.212
...it was available.

718
01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:17.590
Yeah.

719
01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:29.977
I guess I was available too.

720
01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:12.645
Hey, Jack.

721
01:02:15.774 --> 01:02:18.609
What am I supposed to call you now?

722
01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:24.990
You're supposed to call me Dad.
That's what I am, your dad.

723
01:02:25.409 --> 01:02:27.284
Are you really?

724
01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:32.164
So you're some kind of
closet-mobster dad?

725
01:02:32.332 --> 01:02:33.874
If I rob Millikan's drug store...

726
01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:37.002
...will you ground me if I don't
give you a piece of the action?

727
01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:39.588
What, Dad? You tell me.

728
01:02:40.465 --> 01:02:41.841
Please, son. Don't.

729
01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:44.677
If I talk to Sam about you...

730
01:02:44.845 --> 01:02:46.345
...will you have me whacked?

731
01:02:50.183 --> 01:02:52.101
Jack.

732
01:03:52.412 --> 01:03:54.205
Tom?

733
01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:56.499
Hey, Sam. How are you doing?

734
01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:59.585
- Good to see you up and around.
- Yeah.

735
01:03:59.753 --> 01:04:01.128
You had her running yet?

736
01:04:01.546 --> 01:04:03.839
Yeah, for a second there.

737
01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:06.425
She's coming back to life.

738
01:04:07.427 --> 01:04:09.595
Shit.

739
01:04:11.598 --> 01:04:13.140
Tom...

740
01:04:15.435 --> 01:04:17.102
...I got a problem.

741
01:04:19.272 --> 01:04:21.398
Wanna come inside for a minute?

742
01:04:27.447 --> 01:04:30.449
I've been running through it all
for the last couple days.

743
01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:35.246
It just doesn't fit.

744
01:04:37.457 --> 01:04:39.750
- What doesn't fit?
- None of it.

745
01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:47.091
Is that Edie coming home?

746
01:04:47.968 --> 01:04:49.760
Yeah.

747
01:04:50.679 --> 01:04:53.305
Well, we don't have to do this now.

748
01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:56.559
Might as well.

749
01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:03.440
Hi, Sam.

750
01:05:04.109 --> 01:05:06.986
Edie. How you doing?

751
01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:09.780
I'm okay.

752
01:05:11.783 --> 01:05:14.118
- You want some coffee?
- No, I'm good.

753
01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:19.498
So, what brings you out here?

754
01:05:19.708 --> 01:05:21.834
Well, Tom and I were just
talking about that.

755
01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:25.170
Mm. I'd like to hear it.

756
01:05:27.632 --> 01:05:29.633
Well, it's just that...

757
01:05:31.678 --> 01:05:34.513
...none of this makes any sense.
- Hmm.

758
01:05:34.681 --> 01:05:36.515
These are serious, secretive men.

759
01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:39.518
They wouldn't have come out here,
gone through all this...

760
01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:41.353
...exposed themselves like this...

761
01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:44.189
...unless they were dead certain
they had the right man.

762
01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:48.819
So, what are you saying, Sam?

763
01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:55.034
I'm saying I think
I need to hear the truth.

764
01:05:57.495 --> 01:05:59.163
The truth?

765
01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:06.712
The truth.

766
01:06:14.846 --> 01:06:17.556
Sam, you've got too much time
on your hands.

767
01:06:18.892 --> 01:06:20.684
I'm sorry?

768
01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:24.355
Tom is...

769
01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:29.318
Tom is who he says he is.
That's all that really matters.

770
01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:33.238
Sam, hasn't this family suffered enough?

771
01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:39.536
Well...

772
01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:42.373
Goddamn.

773
01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:48.295
- Edie...
- it's okay.

774
01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:53.884
I guess I'll be going.

775
01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:03.435
You folks give me a ring
if you need anything.

776
01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.442
Anything at all, understand?

777
01:07:21.579 --> 01:07:23.372
Thanks.

778
01:07:27.627 --> 01:07:29.294
Edie.

779
01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:30.796
Edie!

780
01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:32.631
Get off of me!

781
01:07:37.137 --> 01:07:39.555
Fuck you, Joey!

782
01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:43.475
Get-- Get off!

783
01:09:07.852 --> 01:09:09.061
Oh, God.

784
01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:12.731
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

785
01:10:51.331 --> 01:10:52.748
Hello.

786
01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:55.334
Hey, bro-heem.

787
01:10:55.543 --> 01:10:58.170
You're still pretty good with the killing.

788
01:10:58.338 --> 01:11:00.339
That's exciting.

789
01:11:01.132 --> 01:11:02.799
Richie.

790
01:11:02.967 --> 01:11:06.011
- Yeah, it's Richie.
- What do you say, Joey?

791
01:11:06.179 --> 01:11:08.305
Are you gonna come see me?

792
01:11:08.473 --> 01:11:11.016
Or do I have to come see you?

793
01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:49.132
Genny Cream.

794
01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:51.093
Bottle.

795
01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:33.343
Are you Ruben?

796
01:14:34.053 --> 01:14:36.847
Yeah. You Joey?

797
01:14:48.734 --> 01:14:50.193
Yeah, I'm Joey.

798
01:14:53.865 --> 01:14:55.907
So, what do we do now?

799
01:14:58.286 --> 01:15:00.287
You finish your beer...

800
01:15:00.705 --> 01:15:03.707
...then I take you to see Richie
in the Escalade.

801
01:15:25.188 --> 01:15:27.189
Nice houses.

802
01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:30.734
Richie's a very upscale kind of guy.

803
01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:48.752
Nice gate.

804
01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:50.337
Yeah.

805
01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:25.580
We're here.

806
01:16:25.873 --> 01:16:28.291
Home sweet home.

807
01:16:58.906 --> 01:17:00.198
Gotta frisk you.

808
01:17:00.491 --> 01:17:03.493
I'll save you the trouble.
I'm not packing.

809
01:17:05.705 --> 01:17:07.539
I gotta frisk you.

810
01:17:10.042 --> 01:17:11.835
All right.

811
01:17:12.003 --> 01:17:13.712
I don't smell very good.

812
01:17:13.879 --> 01:17:18.216
Been driving pretty much nonstop,
15 to 16 hours.

813
01:17:18.384 --> 01:17:20.510
I'll hold my nose.

814
01:17:31.814 --> 01:17:36.401
Can you believe that place
is still standing, the Track & Turf?

815
01:17:43.326 --> 01:17:45.201
Didn't you bang Jill Levy there...

816
01:17:45.369 --> 01:17:47.746
...right on the bar in front of everybody?

817
01:17:48.539 --> 01:17:50.415
I never banged Jill Levy.

818
01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:54.753
Well, you should've. She was...

819
01:17:55.379 --> 01:17:56.921
She was something.

820
01:18:05.723 --> 01:18:08.016
How you doing, Richie?

821
01:18:27.953 --> 01:18:32.374
Yeah. It's been a long,
long time, bro-heem.

822
01:18:43.302 --> 01:18:45.303
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

823
01:18:46.472 --> 01:18:47.639
Come with me.

824
01:19:00.319 --> 01:19:01.945
You want anything?

825
01:19:02.113 --> 01:19:03.822
No.

826
01:19:08.828 --> 01:19:11.955
So you like that farm life?

827
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:14.916
Milking cows and shit?

828
01:19:16.127 --> 01:19:18.002
I don't have a farm.

829
01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:20.338
No?

830
01:19:20.673 --> 01:19:24.259
Fogarty thought you lived
on some kind of farm.

831
01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:30.056
Said you could smell pig.

832
01:19:30.641 --> 01:19:33.768
How that old fart would know
what a pig smells like, I don't know...

833
01:19:33.936 --> 01:19:36.354
...but that's what he said.

834
01:19:41.944 --> 01:19:45.071
- Do you like being married?
- What?

835
01:19:45.448 --> 01:19:47.198
Do you like being married?

836
01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:51.703
Does it work for you?

837
01:19:51.954 --> 01:19:54.706
I can't see it working for me.

838
01:19:55.374 --> 01:19:57.375
I never felt the urge, you know?

839
01:19:57.543 --> 01:19:59.836
A lot of great-looking women
in the world.

840
01:20:00.713 --> 01:20:04.215
I never met one made me wanna
give up all the others.

841
01:20:04.717 --> 01:20:06.092
Sure, you can fuck around...

842
01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:08.803
...but it's so much goddamn work,
you know?

843
01:20:08.971 --> 01:20:13.057
Keeping it quiet.
It's not worth the effort.

844
01:20:14.226 --> 01:20:15.852
I don't see the upside.

845
01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:18.396
You see the upside, Joey?

846
01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:22.317
Yeah, Richie, I do.

847
01:20:23.569 --> 01:20:25.069
I do now.

848
01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:31.034
I'm pretty pissed at you, bro-heem.

849
01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:34.871
You could've called.

850
01:20:35.039 --> 01:20:38.750
You could've dropped
a postcard in the mail.

851
01:20:39.835 --> 01:20:42.420
We're brothers.
What'd you think would happen?

852
01:20:56.769 --> 01:20:59.270
I thought that business would come first.

853
01:20:59.730 --> 01:21:01.940
Well, yeah.

854
01:21:02.608 --> 01:21:04.943
Yeah, I know.

855
01:21:05.778 --> 01:21:08.071
I know.

856
01:21:10.449 --> 01:21:12.033
What am I gonna do?

857
01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:15.453
You bust up a made man's place.

858
01:21:15.663 --> 01:21:17.330
You killed some of his guys.

859
01:21:17.498 --> 01:21:19.791
You take his eye.

860
01:21:19.959 --> 01:21:24.087
Jesus, Joey, you took his eye.

861
01:21:24.255 --> 01:21:26.631
Barbed wire, wasn't it?

862
01:21:26.799 --> 01:21:29.884
That's disgusting.
You always were the crazy one.

863
01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:33.137
- Not any more.
- Yeah, I heard.

864
01:21:33.305 --> 01:21:36.891
You're living the American dream.
You really bought into it, didn't you?

865
01:21:37.059 --> 01:21:41.771
You've been this other guy
almost as long as you been yourself.

866
01:21:45.276 --> 01:21:48.820
Hey. When you dream...

867
01:21:49.446 --> 01:21:51.698
...are you still Joey?

868
01:21:53.826 --> 01:21:55.618
Joey's been dead a long time.

869
01:21:55.828 --> 01:21:58.621
And yet here you sit...

870
01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:01.332
...big as life.

871
01:22:04.461 --> 01:22:06.004
You know you cost me...

872
01:22:06.839 --> 01:22:10.049
...a lot of time and money.

873
01:22:10.217 --> 01:22:12.594
Before you pulled that shit
with Fogarty...

874
01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:16.014
...I was a shoo-in to take over
when the boss croaked.

875
01:22:16.181 --> 01:22:18.349
A shoo-in.

876
01:22:19.184 --> 01:22:21.603
It was made very clear to me, Joey.

877
01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:23.688
I had to clean up your mess...

878
01:22:23.981 --> 01:22:27.108
...or nothing was ever
gonna happen for me.

879
01:22:27.985 --> 01:22:31.154
You got no idea
how much shit I had to pull...

880
01:22:31.322 --> 01:22:34.532
...to get back in with those guys.

881
01:22:36.702 --> 01:22:38.995
You cost me...

882
01:22:41.498 --> 01:22:45.043
...a hell of a lot, Joey, a hell of a lot.

883
01:22:47.463 --> 01:22:49.797
It looks like you're doing
all right over here.

884
01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:54.052
Yeah, I am, I am.

885
01:22:54.219 --> 01:22:57.305
I'm still behind the eight ball...

886
01:22:58.140 --> 01:22:59.682
...because of you.

887
01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:04.312
There's a certain lack of respect,
a certain lack of trust.

888
01:23:07.483 --> 01:23:11.569
The boys in Boston
are just waiting for me to go down.

889
01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:19.911
You always were
a problem for me, Joey.

890
01:23:20.079 --> 01:23:22.205
When Mom brought you home
from the hospital...

891
01:23:22.373 --> 01:23:25.083
...I tried to strangle you in your crib.

892
01:23:25.292 --> 01:23:28.419
I guess all kids try to do that.

893
01:23:28.587 --> 01:23:30.505
She caught me...

894
01:23:30.673 --> 01:23:33.383
...whacked the daylights out of me.

895
01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:36.260
I've heard that story.

896
01:23:40.099 --> 01:23:42.725
Well, what do you think?

897
01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:48.731
Better late than never?

898
01:23:49.316 --> 01:23:50.775
Richie...

899
01:23:52.903 --> 01:23:55.530
...I'm here to make peace.

900
01:23:55.906 --> 01:23:59.117
Tell me what I gotta do
to make things right.

901
01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:03.538
You could do something, I guess.

902
01:24:09.336 --> 01:24:11.337
You could die, Joey.

903
01:25:08.187 --> 01:25:10.396
How do you fuck that up?

904
01:25:11.774 --> 01:25:15.902
How do you fuck that up?!

905
01:25:33.796 --> 01:25:36.130
What are you gonna do,
give him mouth-to-mouth?

906
01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:38.633
Did you see my brother?

907
01:25:38.842 --> 01:25:43.638
Fucking leave this,
and let's just kill that little fuck!

908
01:26:45.284 --> 01:26:47.618
Jesus, Joey.

909
01:27:10.934 --> 01:27:13.436
Jesus, Richie.
