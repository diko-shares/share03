00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.707
<i>There we are,
floating peacefully in the sky.</i>

2
00:01:30.774 --> 00:01:33.610
<i>Metro City, the jewel in the crown.</i>

3
00:01:34.068 --> 00:01:37.361
<i>Beautiful, isn't it?
But how did we get here?</i>

4
00:01:37.812 --> 00:01:40.582
<i>A century ago,
the founders of Metro City...</i>

5
00:01:40.623 --> 00:01:42.442
<i>seeing our world was changing...</i>

6
00:01:42.607 --> 00:01:46.536
<i>took Mount and lifted it out of the Earth
and into the sky.</i>

7
00:01:48.355 --> 00:01:50.628
<i>a floating paradise.</i>

8
00:01:52.488 --> 00:01:54.637
<i>We don't really know
what happens in these days...</i>

9
00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.903
<i>on the strange and mysterious surface
we left behind.</i>

10
00:01:58.068 --> 00:02:01.003
<i>But life in Metro City is better than ever.</i>

11
00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:04.600
<i>Thanks to our friends, the Robots.</i>

12
00:02:05.096 --> 00:02:06.833
<i>Robots do our shopping.</i>

13
00:02:07.908 --> 00:02:09.478
<i>They cook for us.</i>

14
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.025
<i>They serve our meals.
They take good care of us.</i>

15
00:02:14.356 --> 00:02:16.713
<i>They even do the really
important things like...</i>

16
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.730
<i>reminding us to call Momma on her birthday.</i>

17
00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:22.955
<i>What else, raising our children,
building our buildings...</i>

18
00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:24.319
<i>taking care of our city...</i>

19
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:26.757
<i>or making sure we were all fit and healthy.</i>

20
00:02:26.963 --> 00:02:30.188
<i>For these guys... no job is too big.</i>

21
00:02:31.428 --> 00:02:32.835
<i>Or too small.</i>

22
00:02:33.083 --> 00:02:36.018
<i>First, Robots do a all of things
that frankly,</i>

23
00:02:36.102 --> 00:02:38.416
<i>We didn't just don't wanted to do anymore.</i>

24
00:02:39.243 --> 00:02:40.110
Oh, no!

25
00:02:40.235 --> 00:02:41.516
<i>No worries, folks.</i>

26
00:02:41.724 --> 00:02:43.417
<i>That street will get cleaned.</i>

27
00:02:43.624 --> 00:02:46.971
<i>The best and brightest are then
get picked for the more exciting tasks.</i>

28
00:02:47.262 --> 00:02:50.611
<i>This lucky guy is starting
his first day at his new job.</i>

29
00:02:53.834 --> 00:02:56.439
<i>And it's all thanks to this man.</i>

30
00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:01.937
<i>Dr. Tenma, head of the Ministry of Science
and father of Modern Robotics.</i>

31
00:03:02.227 --> 00:03:04.791
<i>Thanks to him and
the incredible innovations...</i>

32
00:03:04.872 --> 00:03:08.097
Hey, Toby, isn't that your dad?
- It sure is.

33
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.925
Hush!

34
00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:11.363
<i>Our friends the Robots helps us.</i>

35
00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.389
<i>Thousands are created every day...</i>

36
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.825
<i>and thousands are disposed of...</i>

37
00:03:14.835 --> 00:03:16.819
<i>in the great and never ending cycle that...</i>

38
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.340
<i>substains life in our great city.</i>

39
00:03:19.548 --> 00:03:21.367
<i>Thanks for everything, guys.</i>

40
00:03:21.573 --> 00:03:23.558
<i>May you rust in peace!</i>

41
00:03:24.781 --> 00:03:27.200
Okay, students.
Ready for our pop quiz?

42
00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:28.910
What?
- No!

43
00:03:28.994 --> 00:03:30.286
Begin!

44
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.749
I'm so busted!

45
00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:47.511
Yes, Toby?

46
00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:49.722
Is there a problem?
- There's no problem.

47
00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:52.557
I'm just finished and I'd like to leave.
- Finished?

48
00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:56.061
The rocket science
wasn't excatly rocket science.

49
00:03:56.186 --> 00:03:59.730
Well, I don't suppose there's much
point in you staying.

50
00:04:00.398 --> 00:04:01.983
Good luck, guys.

51
00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:09.156
Just like his father.

52
00:04:09.865 --> 00:04:11.574
Hello, Master Toby!

53
00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:13.994
Did you have a good day?
- The best, Orrin.

54
00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:16.371
Thank you, Master Toby.

55
00:04:16.455 --> 00:04:18.873
Very good throw.

56
00:04:21.335 --> 00:04:23.045
Hello, son.
- Hello, sir.

57
00:04:23.087 --> 00:04:24.503
How was school?
- Oh, great!

58
00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:26.923
Mr. Pistachio dropped a
pop quiz on us but...

59
00:04:27.006 --> 00:04:28.716
I'm pretty sure, I got a 100 %.

60
00:04:28.799 --> 00:04:30.801
That's good, son.
Very good.

61
00:04:30.843 --> 00:04:33.387
But I don't want you to become complacent.

62
00:04:33.554 --> 00:04:35.555
It's important to keep studying.

63
00:04:35.722 --> 00:04:37.725
Onward and upward, Toby!

64
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.143
Sure, Dad.

65
00:04:40.937 --> 00:04:44.689
I'm very sad, I'd take you that
symposium on quantum mechanics...

66
00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:47.067
But I'm afraid, I'd have to take
a rain check again.

67
00:04:47.234 --> 00:04:48.818
You... you promised!

68
00:04:48.902 --> 00:04:51.321
I'm sorry, Toby, but it's unavoidable.

69
00:04:51.446 --> 00:04:54.199
President Stone's work for
the unveiling of the "Peacekeeper".

70
00:04:54.241 --> 00:04:55.408
"The Peacekeeper"?

71
00:04:55.534 --> 00:04:58.162
You gotta be kidding me!
- I never kid.

72
00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:00.079
Goodbye, son.

73
00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:03.873
"The Peacekeeper", huh?

74
00:05:04.041 --> 00:05:06.335
Hey, Orrin, change of plan.

75
00:05:06.377 --> 00:05:08.046
Take me to the Ministry of Science.

76
00:05:08.088 --> 00:05:09.630
I'm sorry, Master Toby...

77
00:05:09.672 --> 00:05:12.717
but you father gave me
strict instructions to...

78
00:05:12.842 --> 00:05:15.468
Stop it!
What are you doing back there?

79
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.095
Hey! Hey!

80
00:05:17.471 --> 00:05:20.097
Next stop, Ministry of Science!

81
00:05:29.356 --> 00:05:31.735
Are you ready to blow me way today, Tenma?

82
00:05:31.777 --> 00:05:34.736
To make my hairs stand up?
To knock my socks off?

83
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.113
Yes, yes...

84
00:05:36.197 --> 00:05:38.824
Metaphorically speaking.
- Oh, that's the spirit.

85
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.660
Dr. Elefun is an esteem colleague
of mine, Mr. President.

86
00:05:41.702 --> 00:05:44.538
He may be resistant to
having his discoveries used...

87
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.748
for military purposes.

88
00:05:45.831 --> 00:05:47.791
Oh, you leave Dr. Elefun to me.

89
00:05:47.832 --> 00:05:48.708
Dad!

90
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.042
Hold it!
- Hold it!

91
00:05:50.334 --> 00:05:51.502
What are you doing here?

92
00:05:51.627 --> 00:05:53.754
I gave Orrin specific instructions to...

93
00:05:55.465 --> 00:05:57.468
I wanted to see the demonstration.

94
00:05:57.634 --> 00:05:59.553
You're always talking
about "The Peacemaker"...

95
00:05:59.594 --> 00:06:01.304
Really, Toby?
- Your boy?

96
00:06:01.471 --> 00:06:03.890
Yes, sir.
- Well, let him tag along.

97
00:06:03.973 --> 00:06:05.224
Releasing the potential threat.

98
00:06:05.266 --> 00:06:07.558
It will be good for him.
Good education.

99
00:06:07.684 --> 00:06:08.852
Yes, sir.

100
00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:11.730
So you are interested in robots, son?

101
00:06:11.897 --> 00:06:14.024
Robot weapons?
- Absolutely.

102
00:06:14.274 --> 00:06:15.307
Though, I'm sure you'll agree...

103
00:06:15.317 --> 00:06:18.319
the latest D-Class Interceptor
targeting system...

104
00:06:18.445 --> 00:06:19.946
is quite old fashioned.

105
00:06:21.824 --> 00:06:23.533
Nobody likes a smarty pants!

106
00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:25.994
Take this boy to a safe place
and keep him there.

107
00:06:26.036 --> 00:06:28.664
What? Dad!
- I think for the best, Toby.

108
00:06:28.747 --> 00:06:30.582
But you said, I could see the Peacekeeper!

109
00:06:30.665 --> 00:06:31.958
You still can...

110
00:06:32.208 --> 00:06:34.752
on tonight's news, like everybody else.

111
00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:36.670
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

112
00:06:36.754 --> 00:06:38.463
allow me to present...

113
00:06:38.714 --> 00:06:40.715
Blue core energy!

114
00:06:41.717 --> 00:06:43.552
Blue core energy!

115
00:06:43.718 --> 00:06:46.262
A new self-sustaining power source.

116
00:06:46.388 --> 00:06:48.599
Much stronger than nuclear energy...

117
00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:50.767
and infinitely cleaner.

118
00:06:50.934 --> 00:06:53.228
The raw materials came from space.

119
00:06:53.437 --> 00:06:55.021
A fragment of a star.

120
00:06:55.147 --> 00:06:58.441
Millions of light years away,
but no longer even exists.

121
00:06:58.524 --> 00:07:01.486
This is now all that's left of it.

122
00:07:01.736 --> 00:07:05.113
Properly harnessed, this small sphere...

123
00:07:05.197 --> 00:07:07.991
could transform not only Metro City...

124
00:07:08.033 --> 00:07:10.994
but life of those on the surface as well.

125
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.708
Imagine cleaning Earth's water...

126
00:07:16.875 --> 00:07:18.669
Imagine bringing back the forests.

127
00:07:18.878 --> 00:07:21.921
Imagine overcoming the effects of
centuries of pollution.

128
00:07:22.047 --> 00:07:23.631
I know, he's bit of a dreamer,

129
00:07:23.714 --> 00:07:25.717
but he's a brilliant scientist.

130
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.346
He's a dangerous idiot
who happens to have a high IQ.

131
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:31.848
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

132
00:07:31.931 --> 00:07:35.434
When we extract the depositive
blue energy from the fragment...

133
00:07:35.475 --> 00:07:38.855
we'll be left with this
highly unstable by product...

134
00:07:39.022 --> 00:07:40.481
negative red energy!

135
00:07:40.564 --> 00:07:41.940
Oh, I like that one.

136
00:07:41.982 --> 00:07:44.820
Women voters are partial
to the colour red, you know?

137
00:07:44.986 --> 00:07:47.697
Until we discover,
how to safelty dispose it...

138
00:07:47.822 --> 00:07:49.405
What?
What are you doing?

139
00:07:49.447 --> 00:07:50.448
Stop!

140
00:07:50.615 --> 00:07:53.034
Keep the cores apart
or you will kill us all!

141
00:07:53.117 --> 00:07:54.702
Do as he says.

142
00:07:55.744 --> 00:07:57.330
This is outrageous!

143
00:07:57.455 --> 00:07:59.456
What are you intending to do with it?

144
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.504
I'm gonna give the people of the city
a reason to re-elect me.

145
00:08:03.587 --> 00:08:04.338
How?

146
00:08:04.421 --> 00:08:06.130
There's only one way you can, doctor.

147
00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:08.340
I'm gonna kick some butt.

148
00:08:12.219 --> 00:08:13.678
This is so unfair.

149
00:08:13.887 --> 00:08:15.597
Now cool off, hot shot.

150
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:17.006
Please don't leave me in here, sir.

151
00:08:17.016 --> 00:08:19.560
I can't stand small places
anywhere but here.

152
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.227
Easy, kid!
You're like 13 yrs old.

153
00:08:22.269 --> 00:08:24.105
It's time, you grew backbone.

154
00:08:25.064 --> 00:08:26.356
Thanks for the life lesson...

155
00:08:26.523 --> 00:08:28.109
and thank you for this!

156
00:08:28.526 --> 00:08:30.779
As one friend to another,
don't do this, Tenma.

157
00:08:30.821 --> 00:08:32.239
Oh, come on, Elefun.

158
00:08:32.322 --> 00:08:34.741
You know it as well as I do,
without military funding...

159
00:08:34.782 --> 00:08:35.951
all of our research,

160
00:08:36.034 --> 00:08:38.578
including yours, would grind to a halt!

161
00:08:38.952 --> 00:08:40.120
Start it up!

162
00:08:56.594 --> 00:08:58.179
I told, President Stone...

163
00:08:58.262 --> 00:09:00.389
You gotta bring up the big guns!

164
00:09:00.472 --> 00:09:02.309
I've heard enough for Toby!

165
00:09:02.559 --> 00:09:04.394
Now, the blue core.

166
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:12.775
Hold on!

167
00:09:12.817 --> 00:09:16.070
This blue core
is all sweetness and light, right?

168
00:09:16.153 --> 00:09:19.116
Like, "Save the Dolphins"
and "Give Peace A Chance"?

169
00:09:19.158 --> 00:09:21.577
It's pure positive energy.

170
00:09:21.911 --> 00:09:23.370
Call me a dreamer, but...

171
00:09:23.412 --> 00:09:26.957
I think we'll get a bit more
bank rob using the red one.

172
00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:29.125
Oh, you're not joking!

173
00:09:29.209 --> 00:09:32.043
Sir, we're not putting something
that dangerous...

174
00:09:32.168 --> 00:09:34.005
into something that dangerous.

175
00:09:34.088 --> 00:09:37.007
Listen, Tenma!
I gotta an election to win!

176
00:09:37.049 --> 00:09:40.594
I need my robot to be fighter
and not a lover!

177
00:09:40.719 --> 00:09:43.013
Load the red one.
- I won't.

178
00:09:43.096 --> 00:09:44.265
Hm, then I'll do it.

179
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.226
Move over, sweetheart!
- Hey!

180
00:09:46.267 --> 00:09:47.559
No!

181
00:09:49.061 --> 00:09:51.479
It's like a videogame!

182
00:09:58.612 --> 00:10:00.613
Core loaded.

183
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.323
Piece of cake!

184
00:10:02.698 --> 00:10:04.407
<i>Activate weapon drones!</i>

185
00:10:11.123 --> 00:10:12.709
I hate this job!

186
00:10:15.627 --> 00:10:16.378
Wow!

187
00:10:16.628 --> 00:10:18.339
I gotta get a better look.

188
00:10:18.464 --> 00:10:21.091
I've been checking the classifieds.
- I hear you.

189
00:10:28.097 --> 00:10:30.057
He's using that drone
against the other drones.

190
00:10:30.098 --> 00:10:30.975
How could that be possible?

191
00:10:31.017 --> 00:10:34.144
It's called adaptive technology.
You can absorb and control anything.

192
00:10:34.186 --> 00:10:35.897
Well, I may have flunked out of college...

193
00:10:35.939 --> 00:10:37.732
but I was right about the red core!

194
00:10:37.774 --> 00:10:40.901
He'll say anything, you're
the only one's with the brains.

195
00:10:44.655 --> 00:10:45.948
Sir?

196
00:10:59.084 --> 00:11:00.253
Dad?

197
00:11:00.628 --> 00:11:02.630
Dad!
- Toby!

198
00:11:03.965 --> 00:11:06.592
I can't open it!
I can't open it!

199
00:11:07.385 --> 00:11:08.385
Help me!

200
00:11:08.428 --> 00:11:09.888
Dad, help!
- Toby!

201
00:11:10.013 --> 00:11:12.431
Dad!
- It's going to be okay, Toby!

202
00:11:12.556 --> 00:11:14.140
I'm going to get you out!

203
00:11:14.432 --> 00:11:16.018
Everything's going to be fine!

204
00:11:16.143 --> 00:11:17.727
I promise!

205
00:11:25.403 --> 00:11:26.987
Toby!

206
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:34.034
Burn out!

207
00:12:02.853 --> 00:12:04.688
Whe... Where is Toby?

208
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.066
Where's my son?

209
00:12:08.608 --> 00:12:10.903
I'm so sorry, Tenma.

210
00:12:21.329 --> 00:12:22.914
Toby.

211
00:12:27.086 --> 00:12:29.087
It's all my fault!

212
00:14:07.429 --> 00:14:09.974
He hasn't eaten or slept for days.
- I know.

213
00:14:10.057 --> 00:14:11.892
He's gone crazy, hasn't he?

214
00:14:12.017 --> 00:14:13.685
If you lose your son like that...

215
00:14:13.727 --> 00:14:15.563
and you don't regret,

216
00:14:15.813 --> 00:14:17.814
you're not a human being.

217
00:14:18.106 --> 00:14:19.690
Clear the lab.

218
00:14:36.081 --> 00:14:37.499
He looks just like him!

219
00:14:37.583 --> 00:14:38.917
Doesn't it?

220
00:14:39.501 --> 00:14:41.336
A perfect replica.

221
00:14:41.503 --> 00:14:45.089
Plus, I have uploaded
all of Toby's memories.

222
00:14:45.591 --> 00:14:49.345
It'll think it is Toby.
- Don't expect too much, Tenma.

223
00:14:49.721 --> 00:14:53.599
It has the most advanced
defense systems ever created.

224
00:14:53.682 --> 00:14:55.517
I won't lose him again.

225
00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.685
Did you bring what I asked?

226
00:14:57.977 --> 00:15:00.813
I couldn't refuse a grieving father.

227
00:15:05.735 --> 00:15:08.029
The core is unpredictable.

228
00:15:08.071 --> 00:15:11.030
I can't guarantee, what effect...
- It's gonna make it perfect!

229
00:15:11.364 --> 00:15:12.657
Perfect!

230
00:15:13.159 --> 00:15:14.868
Just like Toby was.

231
00:16:21.681 --> 00:16:22.975
Dad?

232
00:16:23.433 --> 00:16:24.726
Toby!

233
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.193
Dad!

234
00:16:33.734 --> 00:16:35.444
Welcome back, son!

235
00:16:35.946 --> 00:16:37.238
Thank you, Elefun!

236
00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:38.698
I'm gonna take it...

237
00:16:38.865 --> 00:16:40.866
him, home now.

238
00:16:41.033 --> 00:16:43.119
Quality time! Bonding!

239
00:16:43.202 --> 00:16:44.620
All the good things!

240
00:16:44.953 --> 00:16:46.371
Bye, Dr. Elefun.

241
00:16:46.955 --> 00:16:48.707
Bye, Toby!

242
00:16:50.542 --> 00:16:52.210
Incredible!

243
00:17:13.188 --> 00:17:14.481
Dad?

244
00:17:16.691 --> 00:17:18.401
Good morning, son.

245
00:17:19.151 --> 00:17:20.571
How do you feel?

246
00:17:21.363 --> 00:17:22.949
Kinda weird.

247
00:17:24.033 --> 00:17:25.450
Have I been sick or something?

248
00:17:25.617 --> 00:17:28.453
No, you're fine, Toby.
You're perfect.

249
00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:29.621
You are wonderful.

250
00:17:29.704 --> 00:17:31.831
Oh, that's great, because...

251
00:17:38.796 --> 00:17:40.382
Are you okay?

252
00:17:44.384 --> 00:17:45.384
No!

253
00:17:45.427 --> 00:17:48.263
Uh, I must be malfunctioning!
Wires crossing, huh?

254
00:17:48.806 --> 00:17:49.973
It can't be you!

255
00:17:50.223 --> 00:17:51.808
You are...

256
00:17:52.977 --> 00:17:54.562
Oh, my gosh!

257
00:17:54.812 --> 00:17:55.688
You are...

258
00:17:55.813 --> 00:17:58.064
You are...
- Hey, Orrin, you okay?

259
00:17:58.106 --> 00:18:01.650
You're... gonna be
late for school.

260
00:18:04.152 --> 00:18:06.572
Well, I... I must say it...

261
00:18:06.947 --> 00:18:09.783
it's very nice to see you again.

262
00:18:10.243 --> 00:18:11.661
Sit down, Toby.

263
00:18:11.787 --> 00:18:13.788
I want to talk to you.
- Sure, Dad.

264
00:18:13.955 --> 00:18:15.539
It's about school.

265
00:18:15.831 --> 00:18:18.792
I have decided
you shouldn't go anymore, son.

266
00:18:18.959 --> 00:18:20.669
I'm gonna teach you at home.

267
00:18:21.044 --> 00:18:23.170
Myself!
- Sounds good to me.

268
00:18:23.337 --> 00:18:26.175
Hey, Orrin, looks like
we're gonna be hanging out together.

269
00:18:26.341 --> 00:18:28.051
Together? Oh!

270
00:18:28.218 --> 00:18:32.721
Wow, that would be very nice, Master Toby!

271
00:18:33.138 --> 00:18:34.306
Oh, dear!

272
00:18:34.514 --> 00:18:37.226
Please, Toby,
just let the robot do it's things.

273
00:18:37.309 --> 00:18:38.478
Sorry.

274
00:18:39.353 --> 00:18:41.397
Hey, if you're gonna be home as well as me.

275
00:18:41.481 --> 00:18:43.482
What about the ministry, your job?

276
00:18:43.607 --> 00:18:44.901
My job now...

277
00:18:45.068 --> 00:18:47.361
is to be your father.

278
00:18:48.404 --> 00:18:50.697
I'm so freaked!

279
00:18:52.949 --> 00:18:54.950
Let's start with something familiar.

280
00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.621
Four natural calculus.
It's your favorite.

281
00:18:59.455 --> 00:19:00.414
I guess it is.

282
00:19:00.456 --> 00:19:04.962
If, sir wishes perhaps
I could help Master Toby with...

283
00:19:05.253 --> 00:19:07.671
Oh, bad idea.
Bad idea.

284
00:19:07.796 --> 00:19:09.924
I'm a robot.
What am I thinking?

285
00:19:11.551 --> 00:19:13.135
Wrong way!

286
00:19:13.969 --> 00:19:15.137
Okay...

287
00:19:15.262 --> 00:19:16.430
Here.

288
00:19:17.765 --> 00:19:18.932
Excellent.

289
00:19:19.933 --> 00:19:21.142
Yeah!

290
00:19:21.684 --> 00:19:23.394
Interesting solution.

291
00:19:24.061 --> 00:19:26.063
Good! Good!

292
00:19:29.485 --> 00:19:32.737
Bravo, wonderful, excellent... Toby!
First grades on first day!

293
00:19:32.779 --> 00:19:34.363
You ain't seen nothing yet.

294
00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:42.830
<i>Howdy?</i>

295
00:19:51.672 --> 00:19:53.382
Let's get back to basics.

296
00:19:53.799 --> 00:19:55.384
Remember this one?

297
00:19:55.551 --> 00:19:57.551
Kant's "Critique of pure reason".

298
00:19:57.636 --> 00:20:00.471
I used to read to you in bed
when you were little.

299
00:20:00.681 --> 00:20:03.308
To put me to sleep?
- Yes!

300
00:20:03.391 --> 00:20:05.393
You asked for it every night!

301
00:20:06.477 --> 00:20:09.313
That's not quite what I...
- Just try rereading these.

302
00:20:09.396 --> 00:20:11.940
To get the old brain humming again.

303
00:20:12.232 --> 00:20:13.652
More!

304
00:20:30.334 --> 00:20:31.625
Next!

305
00:20:51.812 --> 00:20:52.980
Beautiful!

306
00:20:53.271 --> 00:20:54.856
I got it! I got it!

307
00:20:56.857 --> 00:20:59.152
Sweet, Orrin!
You're the man!

308
00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.614
Yes! You know,
I haven't had this much fun since...

309
00:21:02.697 --> 00:21:03.990
Well, ever!

310
00:21:04.198 --> 00:21:05.616
Check this out!

311
00:21:13.749 --> 00:21:15.042
I'm impressed!

312
00:21:15.334 --> 00:21:17.754
Not knocked out, but impressed.

313
00:21:17.879 --> 00:21:19.881
That's nothing!
Watch this!

314
00:21:26.427 --> 00:21:30.348
Now that is impressive, Master Toby!

315
00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:32.434
Just Toby is fine, Orrin.

316
00:21:38.648 --> 00:21:39.898
Toby!

317
00:21:43.319 --> 00:21:44.653
What are you doing?

318
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.281
I said to read these books,
not destroy them.

319
00:21:47.364 --> 00:21:50.910
I... I just wanted to test
Da Vinci's theories.

320
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.537
I, perhaps...

321
00:21:53.662 --> 00:21:55.246
encouraged...

322
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:56.914
Master Toby,

323
00:21:57.039 --> 00:21:58.333
sir.

324
00:22:01.877 --> 00:22:05.423
You should not be wearing that hat.

325
00:22:06.257 --> 00:22:09.094
A robot should not be wearing my son's...

326
00:22:09.427 --> 00:22:11.179
Toby's hat.

327
00:22:19.269 --> 00:22:20.854
Dad, it's fine.

328
00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.689
I don't even like that hat.

329
00:22:27.277 --> 00:22:28.863
I think you should go to your room.

330
00:22:28.946 --> 00:22:31.280
But, Dad...
- Do as what you're told!

331
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:46.710
Tenma?

332
00:22:46.794 --> 00:22:48.129
What's wrong?

333
00:22:48.421 --> 00:22:50.132
I think I made a terrible mistake.

334
00:22:50.216 --> 00:22:53.051
I thought he would be like Toby!

335
00:22:53.301 --> 00:22:54.303
But it's not!

336
00:22:54.387 --> 00:22:56.805
It is strange.
he's very strange.

337
00:22:56.972 --> 00:22:58.139
Strange?

338
00:22:58.223 --> 00:23:00.517
Strangish, how?
- He's brilliant!

339
00:23:00.601 --> 00:23:03.227
As Toby was, but different.

340
00:23:03.393 --> 00:23:05.854
Well, you can't expect him
to be a carbon copy.

341
00:23:05.938 --> 00:23:08.774
Give time for him, Tenma!
- You don't understand!

342
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.401
He was made to replace Toby!

343
00:23:11.693 --> 00:23:13.112
But everytime I look at him...

344
00:23:13.154 --> 00:23:16.407
it just reminds me that Toby is gone!

345
00:23:18.158 --> 00:23:19.994
He's never coming back.

346
00:23:29.252 --> 00:23:30.544
What's different?

347
00:23:31.128 --> 00:23:33.131
I haven't seen dad angry before.

348
00:23:39.429 --> 00:23:41.848
Look at the haircut on that one!

349
00:23:42.098 --> 00:23:44.934
It's like he got horns!
- Horns? Good one!

350
00:23:44.976 --> 00:23:47.102
What you mean, horns?
It's gel.

351
00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.187
Wait!

352
00:23:49.396 --> 00:23:51.398
I can understand you?
- Wow, that's creepy!

353
00:23:51.482 --> 00:23:54.109
What is?
- Looks like he can understand us!

354
00:23:54.275 --> 00:23:56.694
Don't be a dummy.
- I can hear what you're saying.

355
00:23:56.986 --> 00:23:58.696
It is as if he can hear what we're saying.

356
00:23:58.780 --> 00:23:59.780
There's no way!

357
00:23:59.864 --> 00:24:01.157
He is a human!

358
00:24:01.532 --> 00:24:04.368
Come on, let's go and clean some statues.

359
00:24:04.911 --> 00:24:06.079
Okey-dokey!

360
00:24:07.956 --> 00:24:09.791
How can I understand what you're saying?

361
00:24:09.874 --> 00:24:12.001
You are robots!
- You don't want any trouble.

362
00:24:12.126 --> 00:24:14.128
Wait up! I just wanna know
what's going on?

363
00:24:14.211 --> 00:24:15.379
What's happening to me?

364
00:24:21.634 --> 00:24:22.927
Okay, guys.

365
00:24:23.387 --> 00:24:26.348
Let's back up, very carefully.

366
00:24:28.057 --> 00:24:29.349
Oh, no!

367
00:24:30.602 --> 00:24:32.729
<i>Do not go so fast!
We're coming!</i>

368
00:24:39.861 --> 00:24:41.696
That's weirdy for me!

369
00:25:13.309 --> 00:25:15.311
Wait, this steak is undercooked.

370
00:26:49.024 --> 00:26:50.609
This is so cool!

371
00:26:51.527 --> 00:26:53.236
I gotta show dad.

372
00:26:59.743 --> 00:27:02.579
How can my approval ratings be this low?

373
00:27:02.662 --> 00:27:04.247
I was very popular in high school.

374
00:27:04.331 --> 00:27:07.291
I've cut taxes for a lot of
very influential friends.

375
00:27:07.417 --> 00:27:08.834
What more do you people want!?

376
00:27:08.918 --> 00:27:10.712
We're tracking an unidentified object...

377
00:27:10.753 --> 00:27:12.380
flying over Metro City, sir!

378
00:27:12.463 --> 00:27:14.298
The surface fellas are firing at us?

379
00:27:14.381 --> 00:27:15.831
Oh, this is what I've been waiting for.

380
00:27:15.841 --> 00:27:17.135
Declare war on them.

381
00:27:17.218 --> 00:27:18.927
This is gonna get me re-elected!

382
00:27:18.969 --> 00:27:21.596
This didn't come from the surface, sir!
- Then, it's my opponent.

383
00:27:21.763 --> 00:27:23.807
He's taking the golves off,
he's playing hardball.

384
00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:26.517
It's blue core energy, sir!
- What?

385
00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.896
Elefun, told me that
the blue core was destroyed.

386
00:27:28.979 --> 00:27:30.898
Give me a location, alert all units.

387
00:27:31.023 --> 00:27:32.858
I must have that thing now!

388
00:27:34.775 --> 00:27:36.361
<i>I got here as fast as I could.</i>

389
00:27:37.153 --> 00:27:37.904
Where is he?

390
00:27:37.945 --> 00:27:39.947
Where's Toby?
- I sent him to his room.

391
00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:42.658
Please, just deactivate him
and take him away!

392
00:27:42.741 --> 00:27:46.412
I can't bare to see his face again.

393
00:27:46.829 --> 00:27:47.830
Come on, Tenma!

394
00:27:47.871 --> 00:27:49.915
You can't just throw him away
like a piece of junk.

395
00:27:49.999 --> 00:27:51.166
Dad?

396
00:27:53.335 --> 00:27:54.628
What's going on?

397
00:27:54.712 --> 00:27:56.296
Why you're talking about me like this?

398
00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:59.215
Toby, there's been
a bit of a misunderstanding.

399
00:27:59.382 --> 00:28:03.595
You are not actually,
an entirely ordinary boy.

400
00:28:03.845 --> 00:28:05.263
I know!

401
00:28:05.347 --> 00:28:06.931
Dad, I can fly!

402
00:28:07.015 --> 00:28:09.641
I can drill my way through solid rock,
it's amazing!

403
00:28:10.309 --> 00:28:12.310
How did I think, this could work?

404
00:28:12.977 --> 00:28:15.939
What's wrong with me?
Why don't you love me anymore?

405
00:28:16.106 --> 00:28:19.235
He's programmed with the memories
of your own son, Tenma!

406
00:28:19.277 --> 00:28:22.113
Programmed?
- Doesn't that mean anything to you?

407
00:28:23.531 --> 00:28:25.240
But he isn't my son.

408
00:28:26.407 --> 00:28:27.575
Dad!

409
00:28:28.159 --> 00:28:30.453
I'm... I'm not your dad.

410
00:28:30.661 --> 00:28:32.371
You're not Toby.

411
00:28:32.663 --> 00:28:34.666
You are a copy of Toby.

412
00:28:35.375 --> 00:28:37.376
Not my son, a robot!

413
00:28:37.502 --> 00:28:39.211
And... and I...

414
00:28:40.171 --> 00:28:42.797
don't want you...

415
00:28:43.131 --> 00:28:46.093
anymore!
- No! No!

416
00:28:47.011 --> 00:28:48.303
Toby, wait!

417
00:28:48.513 --> 00:28:51.056
I can't see into the future,
but I'm sure...

418
00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.768
there's a place for you,
you just have to find it.

419
00:28:53.809 --> 00:28:55.227
He's my father!

420
00:28:55.519 --> 00:28:57.103
This is my house!

421
00:28:57.229 --> 00:29:01.106
It's all I know.
- Everyone has a destiny, Toby.

422
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.819
Didn't you hear?
I'm not Toby.

423
00:29:05.111 --> 00:29:06.529
Please Elefun.

424
00:29:33.303 --> 00:29:34.722
It's true!

425
00:29:35.598 --> 00:29:36.766
What?

426
00:29:38.643 --> 00:29:41.104
<i>Sir, we've located
the signal source, but...</i>

427
00:29:41.145 --> 00:29:42.563
<i>It... it's a child.</i>

428
00:29:42.646 --> 00:29:44.649
<i>Readings for the core are off the chart!</i>

429
00:29:44.691 --> 00:29:46.692
Is that Tenma's boy?

430
00:29:46.734 --> 00:29:48.151
Of course not.

431
00:29:48.443 --> 00:29:49.737
Holy cow!

432
00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.948
Tenma must have lost his mind!
Bring it in!

433
00:29:53.156 --> 00:29:55.575
<i>This is Stinger one,
set weapons to capture.</i>

434
00:29:55.908 --> 00:29:57.077
Oh, no!

435
00:29:59.538 --> 00:30:01.248
Woah! He just took off!

436
00:30:01.331 --> 00:30:04.584
Commander, engage the subject
with intend to capture.

437
00:30:12.466 --> 00:30:13.884
What you guys want?

438
00:30:14.051 --> 00:30:16.345
Command center, we have him in our sight!

439
00:30:37.741 --> 00:30:38.909
Ta-da!

440
00:30:39.242 --> 00:30:40.410
Aah! Oh, my God!

441
00:30:40.743 --> 00:30:43.370
I'm... just gonna take
these things back.

442
00:30:43.412 --> 00:30:45.413
I'm getting married!

443
00:30:46.081 --> 00:30:47.374
Get him!

444
00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:52.879
Where'd he go? Huh?

445
00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:54.840
What!?

446
00:31:11.314 --> 00:31:13.316
<i>We got him, we're coming home.</i>

447
00:31:54.479 --> 00:31:56.773
No! No! No!

448
00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.067
Oh, no!

449
00:32:08.409 --> 00:32:10.410
Send in the "Spirit of Freedom".

450
00:32:10.995 --> 00:32:13.415
Destroy the robot and collect the core.

451
00:32:15.666 --> 00:32:16.959
You're safe.

452
00:32:19.128 --> 00:32:20.129
Again?

453
00:32:20.212 --> 00:32:22.630
What's with you, guys?
- I love you.

454
00:32:24.007 --> 00:32:25.299
Come on, then!

455
00:32:43.943 --> 00:32:45.111
Fire!

456
00:33:03.503 --> 00:33:04.671
Finish it.

457
00:33:12.428 --> 00:33:13.845
Touch down!

458
00:33:19.642 --> 00:33:22.271
Hey, where's he going?
- He's falling to the surface, sir.

459
00:33:22.313 --> 00:33:23.606
Get him back!

460
00:33:23.814 --> 00:33:26.233
I'm declaring a
state of national emergency.

461
00:33:26.358 --> 00:33:28.986
Leave for all military personnel
is cancelled...

462
00:33:29.236 --> 00:33:31.529
until Tenma's boy is found.

463
00:33:54.093 --> 00:33:56.094
Welcome to your new home, kid.

464
00:33:57.554 --> 00:33:58.721
Hello!

465
00:33:59.556 --> 00:34:02.601
Batteries!
He's got new batteries.

466
00:34:02.684 --> 00:34:06.354
Can I've few volts for better...
- Batteries?

467
00:34:06.521 --> 00:34:09.064
Help me son, I'm afraid and...

468
00:34:10.941 --> 00:34:13.486
Table for only one?
Smoking or non smoking?

469
00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:16.197
Smoking! I'm smoking!
I'm definitely smoking.

470
00:34:16.573 --> 00:34:18.867
You're one of us now,
and happy to meet you.

471
00:34:18.951 --> 00:34:20.368
Oh, no, I'm...

472
00:34:20.493 --> 00:34:23.745
No! No, I'm not one of you guys.
- You're a robot, ain't you?

473
00:34:24.412 --> 00:34:27.040
Yes, but...
- Welcome to the scrappy.

474
00:34:27.123 --> 00:34:29.667
This is where we all end up,
sooner or later.

475
00:34:29.709 --> 00:34:31.753
No way!
I'm not ready yet.

476
00:34:31.879 --> 00:34:34.548
Hey! Hey, get off me!
What are you doing?

477
00:34:34.631 --> 00:34:36.049
Get off!

478
00:34:36.424 --> 00:34:38.426
Incoming!

479
00:34:54.525 --> 00:34:56.108
What do I do?

480
00:34:58.111 --> 00:34:59.445
Dad.

481
00:35:02.906 --> 00:35:04.744
Who... Who's there?

482
00:35:13.333 --> 00:35:14.668
You like me, huh?

483
00:35:15.668 --> 00:35:16.668
Trash Can.

484
00:35:16.754 --> 00:35:19.006
So, are you lost, Trash Can?

485
00:35:20.007 --> 00:35:21.675
I know, I sure am.

486
00:35:23.094 --> 00:35:24.345
What is it, boy?

487
00:35:24.845 --> 00:35:26.263
Someone's in trouble?

488
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:28.181
Oh, no!

489
00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:31.935
Trash Can, wait up!

490
00:35:34.437 --> 00:35:35.438
Over here?

491
00:35:35.523 --> 00:35:36.690
Whoa!

492
00:35:37.441 --> 00:35:40.026
Is this, it?
Hello?

493
00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.696
It could be miles down.
The hole looks pretty...

494
00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:45.031
deep!

495
00:35:48.282 --> 00:35:50.119
Quick, get those strings on.

496
00:35:50.327 --> 00:35:52.370
Hurry!
- Good work, boy.

497
00:35:52.537 --> 00:35:53.537
Here, for you.

498
00:35:54.039 --> 00:35:56.084
Hey! Hey, knock it off!

499
00:35:57.877 --> 00:36:00.295
That's not a robot.
- It's a kid.

500
00:36:00.462 --> 00:36:04.548
Huh, that's... that's right,
I'm a kid.

501
00:36:04.632 --> 00:36:06.300
Like you.
- What?

502
00:36:06.384 --> 00:36:09.345
We want robots, not kids!
Stupid garbage eater!

503
00:36:09.429 --> 00:36:13.223
So where you from non-robot?
- I'm from Metro City.

504
00:36:13.265 --> 00:36:16.101
Metro City!
Can you beleive it, guys?

505
00:36:16.185 --> 00:36:18.603
He comes from Metro City
and he's actually talking to me.

506
00:36:18.645 --> 00:36:21.482
Are you feeling okay?
- Oh, my God, he talked to me twice.

507
00:36:21.566 --> 00:36:23.400
This is definitely going in my diary...

508
00:36:23.484 --> 00:36:25.319
as the most exciting day of my life.

509
00:36:25.402 --> 00:36:26.403
Okay, I get it.

510
00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:28.405
You don't like people from Metro City.

511
00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:32.075
Metro City...
robots with hand and foot.

512
00:36:32.158 --> 00:36:34.994
I would love to visit, just for one day.

513
00:36:35.286 --> 00:36:36.662
They wouldn't let you in.

514
00:36:36.747 --> 00:36:40.291
They've strict "No losers
from the surface allowed" policy.

515
00:36:40.416 --> 00:36:42.251
Anyway, why would you wanna go some place...

516
00:36:42.293 --> 00:36:44.127
where people think you are garbage?

517
00:36:44.754 --> 00:36:46.881
I mean, look at this...

518
00:36:47.215 --> 00:36:49.508
Can you beleive,
someone just threw it away?

519
00:36:50.134 --> 00:36:51.551
Finders-Keepers!

520
00:36:52.094 --> 00:36:54.388
So what are you doing down here?

521
00:36:54.972 --> 00:36:58.516
I don't know yet.
Looking for something, I guess.

522
00:36:58.976 --> 00:37:00.977
Somewhere.
- Did you ran away?

523
00:37:01.436 --> 00:37:02.603
Not exactly.

524
00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:05.898
They sorta suggested that
I'd find a new place.

525
00:37:06.399 --> 00:37:07.566
Whatever that means.

526
00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:09.945
Dude, it means that they kicked you out.

527
00:37:10.112 --> 00:37:13.072
Well, I...
- I'm Zane.

528
00:37:13.448 --> 00:37:15.032
I'm Widget.
- Hi, I'm Sludge.

529
00:37:15.116 --> 00:37:16.825
And I'm older than her.
- By 90 seconds.

530
00:37:16.992 --> 00:37:18.828
And I am Cora.
What's your name?

531
00:37:18.995 --> 00:37:20.287
Oh, it's...

532
00:37:20.788 --> 00:37:23.081
Viva la robot revolution!

533
00:37:23.248 --> 00:37:24.542
What just happened?

534
00:37:26.586 --> 00:37:28.711
Did you see the human's face?

535
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.548
They were quaking
in their capitalistic boots.

536
00:37:33.341 --> 00:37:35.050
Don't worry, brother.
You are safe.

537
00:37:35.135 --> 00:37:36.969
You've been rescued by...

538
00:37:37.596 --> 00:37:40.015
The Robot Revolutionary Front.

539
00:37:41.224 --> 00:37:45.853
I'm Sparx, the brightest.
- And I'm Robotsky, the muscle.

540
00:37:46.061 --> 00:37:47.646
I'm Mike, the fridge.

541
00:37:48.271 --> 00:37:49.439
I'm the fridge.

542
00:37:49.939 --> 00:37:53.193
You are now liberated.
Go ahead, comrade.

543
00:37:53.318 --> 00:37:56.447
Take your first step as a free robot.

544
00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:58.115
Take it! Take it!

545
00:38:01.285 --> 00:38:03.120
It feels different, doesn't it?

546
00:38:03.995 --> 00:38:07.373
It feels wetter.
- It feels wetter!

547
00:38:07.415 --> 00:38:09.250
Liberation!

548
00:38:10.334 --> 00:38:12.962
Yeah!
- What are you doing?

549
00:38:14.005 --> 00:38:15.297
Sorry.

550
00:38:16.257 --> 00:38:19.384
I'll... I'll pick it up.
- Yes, please.

551
00:38:20.426 --> 00:38:23.388
You look like a pretty advanced model,
if I may say so, robot.

552
00:38:23.471 --> 00:38:25.922
Just out of interest, there's no
peculiar reason for me asking...

553
00:38:25.932 --> 00:38:28.060
are you...
Laws of Robotics?

554
00:38:28.143 --> 00:38:29.562
Hm, remind me?

555
00:38:29.687 --> 00:38:31.522
A robot cannot harm a human...

556
00:38:31.564 --> 00:38:33.690
be the cause of any harm to a human.

557
00:38:33.732 --> 00:38:36.025
Blah, blah, blah, boring, boring, boring.

558
00:38:36.192 --> 00:38:38.610
Well, I don't really wanna harm anybody.

559
00:38:38.736 --> 00:38:39.903
Nonsense!

560
00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:44.117
The RRF is dedicated to freeing
robot kind from human's slavery,

561
00:38:44.158 --> 00:38:46.160
by any means necessary.

562
00:38:46.201 --> 00:38:49.580
Any means!
Any means necessary.

563
00:38:49.663 --> 00:38:51.499
What is your name, comrade?

564
00:38:52.499 --> 00:38:54.209
Toby.
- Toby?

565
00:38:54.293 --> 00:38:57.546
That's not much of a name,
now you must add bit more to it.

566
00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:59.339
Something like...
The Ice Maker!

567
00:38:59.423 --> 00:39:01.425
Yeah!
Or The Annihilator.

568
00:39:01.759 --> 00:39:03.176
Or Pauline.

569
00:39:03.969 --> 00:39:05.136
Well, I guess...

570
00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:07.639
Hey, we haven't come up
with a new name for you yet.

571
00:39:07.681 --> 00:39:09.265
What about...

572
00:39:11.975 --> 00:39:15.021
What about Astro?
- Oh, be quiet!

573
00:39:15.104 --> 00:39:17.106
If you can't come up
with a sensible suggestion...

574
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:19.066
then kindly, mind your own business.

575
00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:21.778
Sorry.
- Think. Think.

576
00:39:21.861 --> 00:39:22.945
I got it!
- What?

577
00:39:22.987 --> 00:39:25.405
Astro!
- Oh, that's marvellous. That is...

578
00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:27.657
It's modern, little space age.
I love it.

579
00:39:27.699 --> 00:39:29.743
Thanks, guys.
Well, I'd better get going.

580
00:39:29.826 --> 00:39:32.245
Show, Astro, the plan.

581
00:39:32.411 --> 00:39:33.997
As you wish, comrade.

582
00:39:34.331 --> 00:39:36.040
This is the Ham Egg.

583
00:39:38.667 --> 00:39:41.504
Nice.
- The likes of him enslave our kind.

584
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:43.505
We need to make an example of Ham Egg.

585
00:39:43.588 --> 00:39:47.135
We wanna do something so horrible,
so frightening, so shocking...

586
00:39:47.302 --> 00:39:50.429
that the humans will be forced
to free all the robots.

587
00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:53.015
What are you gonna do?
- We're gonna sneak into town...

588
00:39:53.099 --> 00:39:55.725
And lie and wait for Ham Egg.
- And?

589
00:39:55.809 --> 00:39:58.520
And when he shows...
- Yes?

590
00:39:58.562 --> 00:40:01.814
Let me remind that we're forced
to follow the Laws of Robotics.

591
00:40:01.898 --> 00:40:03.899
Okay.
- We're gonna...

592
00:40:04.149 --> 00:40:06.277
just tickle him with a feather!

593
00:40:06.694 --> 00:40:09.781
Viva la robot revolution!
- That's the plan?

594
00:40:09.822 --> 00:40:12.117
We are ready to go
in purchasing the feather.

595
00:40:12.325 --> 00:40:14.952
Oh, bloody!
- You okay?

596
00:40:15.036 --> 00:40:17.038
How did you find our secret hideout?

597
00:40:17.121 --> 00:40:19.999
You guys really need to work
on your camouflage skills.

598
00:40:20.124 --> 00:40:23.084
Don't make us dismantle you,
we just want the kid back.

599
00:40:23.168 --> 00:40:25.462
Kid? What're you talking about?
He is a...

600
00:40:26.713 --> 00:40:28.297
You want a piece of me, Tin Man?

601
00:40:28.381 --> 00:40:29.006
Be cool.

602
00:40:29.048 --> 00:40:30.885
I'm a undercover robot from Metro City.

603
00:40:30.968 --> 00:40:33.804
Yeah, I knew it!
Viva la robot revolution!

604
00:40:34.512 --> 00:40:36.097
These guys aren't doing any harm.

605
00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:38.808
Let's just leave them.
- Whatever you say.

606
00:40:40.393 --> 00:40:44.063
Thank you, brother.
The RRF are forever in your debt.

607
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:47.900
So, what is your name?

608
00:40:48.943 --> 00:40:52.070
Toby, but...
that's not who I really am.

609
00:40:52.195 --> 00:40:54.197
You see...
- Dude, it's a simple question.

610
00:40:55.866 --> 00:40:57.993
My name is Astro.

611
00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.744
Call me Astro.
- Cool!

612
00:40:59.828 --> 00:41:02.457
Sounds modern.
- Little space age, I love it.

613
00:41:03.458 --> 00:41:05.459
<i>Hold on, I'll be right there.</i>

614
00:41:05.668 --> 00:41:07.502
Good afternoon.
- Excuse me, robot, thank you.

615
00:41:07.586 --> 00:41:09.879
Search the apartment,
leave no stone upturned.

616
00:41:10.046 --> 00:41:12.339
Arrest this man.
- Yes, sir.

617
00:41:12.381 --> 00:41:15.426
What are you doing? Stop!
- Where is Tenma's robot-son?

618
00:41:15.551 --> 00:41:18.512
He isn't here.
- What is the meaning of this?

619
00:41:18.637 --> 00:41:21.599
You put the core from my "Peacemaker"
into your robot.

620
00:41:21.891 --> 00:41:24.185
I'm running for re-election
incase you haven't noticed.

621
00:41:24.269 --> 00:41:25.967
And we're in an arms race with the surface.

622
00:41:25.977 --> 00:41:28.397
An arms race?
What, nonsense!

623
00:41:30.023 --> 00:41:31.858
It was a stupid mistake.

624
00:41:32.525 --> 00:41:34.820
When I lost my son I thought...

625
00:41:35.863 --> 00:41:37.280
I would be able to...

626
00:41:37.572 --> 00:41:38.740
I thought...

627
00:41:38.823 --> 00:41:41.785
I know, I hate loosing too.

628
00:41:41.952 --> 00:41:44.411
If you want proof of that,
you can ask any of my wives.

629
00:41:44.494 --> 00:41:47.539
But we gotta get over
our own personal stuff, Tenma.

630
00:41:47.581 --> 00:41:49.626
You're head of the Ministry of Science.

631
00:41:49.751 --> 00:41:51.127
It's time to move on.

632
00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:53.672
Get the core back,
get it in "The Peacemaker".

633
00:41:53.755 --> 00:41:56.173
Let's some good come from all this mess.

634
00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:03.887
When you find the robot,
I'll deactivate it.

635
00:42:04.556 --> 00:42:06.975
And give you the core.
- Good man.

636
00:42:07.309 --> 00:42:08.476
Let him go.

637
00:42:11.478 --> 00:42:13.774
Let's hope, you'll never find him.

638
00:42:15.192 --> 00:42:17.609
So, there's actually people
living in these ruins?

639
00:42:17.734 --> 00:42:18.902
Ruins?

640
00:42:18.986 --> 00:42:21.823
Hey, it may not look much
to a Metro City kid...

641
00:42:21.864 --> 00:42:23.866
but this place is home to us.

642
00:42:23.949 --> 00:42:25.368
Here we are.

643
00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.664
Come on, Astro.

644
00:42:37.753 --> 00:42:39.340
Alright.

645
00:42:45.595 --> 00:42:47.221
What's the password?

646
00:42:47.305 --> 00:42:49.139
Don't make me hurt you.

647
00:42:49.765 --> 00:42:51.350
Close enough.

648
00:43:00.692 --> 00:43:01.859
Four!

649
00:43:02.193 --> 00:43:04.320
Five!
- You're out!

650
00:43:04.572 --> 00:43:07.199
We are out of apples,
we're gonna use grapes.

651
00:43:07.782 --> 00:43:09.992
Hey, Cora, did you bring me back something?

652
00:43:10.076 --> 00:43:12.704
A perfect gift for a sweet little girl.

653
00:43:13.538 --> 00:43:14.955
Thanks!

654
00:43:15.206 --> 00:43:16.498
Be careful!

655
00:43:17.041 --> 00:43:18.334
Too late!

656
00:43:19.668 --> 00:43:21.670
Are you okay?
- Sure.

657
00:43:21.753 --> 00:43:24.047
We need ten sets of eyes around here.

658
00:43:30.346 --> 00:43:31.764
Hey, Ham Egg!

659
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:37.018
Aha, back so soon?

660
00:43:37.144 --> 00:43:39.438
You guys find anything good to me today?

661
00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.273
I don't know, kids.

662
00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:45.401
Lot of dead batteries, lot of elbows here.

663
00:43:45.776 --> 00:43:48.612
The knee joint's of
a toilet cleaning robot?

664
00:43:48.696 --> 00:43:51.948
I told ya, I need hands.
- We'd have got better stuff but this...

665
00:43:57.205 --> 00:43:59.498
Well, well.
- His name is Astro.

666
00:43:59.664 --> 00:44:03.126
He is from Metro City.
- Metro City? Wow!

667
00:44:03.251 --> 00:44:05.378
I used to work there, once upon a time.

668
00:44:05.461 --> 00:44:06.629
Really?

669
00:44:07.087 --> 00:44:09.508
Why am I running a crummy
body repair shop down here...

670
00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:12.510
when I could be creating
state of the art robots in Metro City?

671
00:44:12.552 --> 00:44:14.970
Well, no, I didn't mean to...
- Relax, son.

672
00:44:15.012 --> 00:44:18.306
We are a family here,
we're allowed to ask questions.

673
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:19.682
The answer is...

674
00:44:19.849 --> 00:44:21.435
I love robots!

675
00:44:21.519 --> 00:44:23.145
Especially the discarded ones.

676
00:44:23.228 --> 00:44:25.523
The more banged up they are,
the more abused...

677
00:44:25.565 --> 00:44:28.401
the more I like
getting them back on their feet.

678
00:44:30.444 --> 00:44:31.736
Oh, wow!

679
00:44:31.986 --> 00:44:34.114
It's almost a religious thing with me,

680
00:44:34.197 --> 00:44:37.074
kind of like the way,
saints feel about the poor,

681
00:44:37.158 --> 00:44:39.284
or what women feel about shoes,

682
00:44:39.368 --> 00:44:41.413
or fat people feel about donuts,

683
00:44:41.496 --> 00:44:42.914
or, uh...

684
00:44:43.581 --> 00:44:45.165
I'll stop with fat people and donuts.

685
00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:48.128
So you're not into enslaving robots?

686
00:44:48.211 --> 00:44:50.629
What?
- He ran into the RRF.

687
00:44:51.546 --> 00:44:55.092
I don't enslave robots.

688
00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:57.136
I love robots!

689
00:44:57.219 --> 00:44:58.512
They're our friends...

690
00:44:58.679 --> 00:45:01.640
and we rely on them for our daily bread.

691
00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:04.726
Speaking of which,
are any of you misfits hungry?

692
00:45:06.769 --> 00:45:07.769
Let me guess...

693
00:45:07.811 --> 00:45:09.938
take a pizza again?

694
00:45:10.021 --> 00:45:12.651
More like, taken out of trash again.

695
00:45:12.735 --> 00:45:15.987
Picky, picky!
It's only a couple of days old.

696
00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:18.490
Look, this one still has toppings.

697
00:45:20.491 --> 00:45:23.326
Hey, haven't you forgotten something?

698
00:45:24.619 --> 00:45:26.454
What they've forgotten, son?

699
00:45:27.623 --> 00:45:29.749
Grace?
- Exactly.

700
00:45:30.166 --> 00:45:32.085
Grace!
- What?

701
00:45:32.169 --> 00:45:34.295
Turn on the TV, sweetheart.
Would you please?

702
00:45:34.379 --> 00:45:35.546
That's my girl.

703
00:45:37.424 --> 00:45:39.425
Well, bon appetit!

704
00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:41.844
Yo, new guy, you're gonna eat that?

705
00:45:41.927 --> 00:45:43.221
You can have it if you want it.

706
00:45:43.262 --> 00:45:45.890
Don't be so nice,
you're gonna starve to death.

707
00:45:46.557 --> 00:45:48.684
Or be the only survivor.

708
00:45:48.934 --> 00:45:52.063
So tell me, Astro,
do your folks know where you are?

709
00:45:52.646 --> 00:45:54.064
I don't have any parents.

710
00:45:54.147 --> 00:45:57.275
Oh, I'm very sorry.
Did you lose them?

711
00:45:57.358 --> 00:45:59.903
Or even sadder, did they lose you?

712
00:45:59.986 --> 00:46:01.404
No...

713
00:46:02.072 --> 00:46:04.908
The truth is, I'm actually a...

714
00:46:05.492 --> 00:46:07.077
I'm a...

715
00:46:07.494 --> 00:46:08.911
A what?

716
00:46:09.454 --> 00:46:10.330
Don't worry, son.

717
00:46:10.455 --> 00:46:12.165
We are all orphans down here.

718
00:46:12.248 --> 00:46:14.249
Nothing to be ashamed about.

719
00:46:15.292 --> 00:46:19.380
So none of you have parents?
- Parents? Are you kidding me?

720
00:46:22.215 --> 00:46:24.051
This whole place is a parent-free zone.

721
00:46:24.092 --> 00:46:25.927
I was born in the scrappy.

722
00:46:26.219 --> 00:46:28.221
I was raised by wild dogs.
- Really?

723
00:46:28.305 --> 00:46:30.307
Are you sure, it wasn't wild pigs?

724
00:46:49.158 --> 00:46:51.826
Feeling homesick for Metro City, Astro?

725
00:46:53.245 --> 00:46:55.373
No.
- Me neither.

726
00:46:57.624 --> 00:47:01.421
I was the head of Advanced Robotics
at the Ministry of Science.

727
00:47:01.963 --> 00:47:06.340
Oh, yeah, right up there with Tenma
and other monkey.

728
00:47:06.715 --> 00:47:09.469
What happened?
- What always happens to geniuses.

729
00:47:09.552 --> 00:47:12.679
They were intimidated by
my talents, my ideas...

730
00:47:12.929 --> 00:47:16.058
Though, they threw me away
like an old battery.

731
00:47:17.393 --> 00:47:18.687
I'm sorry.

732
00:47:19.062 --> 00:47:20.064
Not your problem.

733
00:47:20.147 --> 00:47:23.690
You know, I got a hunch about you, Astro...

734
00:47:23.774 --> 00:47:26.610
there's always room for a
good kid in this family.

735
00:47:27.653 --> 00:47:29.487
Now, how about getting some shine?

736
00:47:30.405 --> 00:47:32.825
Good night... son.

737
00:47:34.076 --> 00:47:35.911
Good night, Ham Egg.

738
00:47:39.205 --> 00:47:42.874
I'm gonna tell them, just...
not yet, okay?

739
00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:54.095
Hey, quit bugging me.
I said, I would.

740
00:47:54.178 --> 00:47:56.471
I just wanted to get used to me first.

741
00:47:59.307 --> 00:48:02.685
What is Ham Egg want all these parts for?
- He's a genius.

742
00:48:02.768 --> 00:48:06.398
He can make cool robots
from pretty much any old scrap.

743
00:48:06.481 --> 00:48:09.610
And then he puts them into
Ham Egg's Robot Games!

744
00:48:09.693 --> 00:48:12.320
Robot Games?
- There are tradition down here.

745
00:48:12.403 --> 00:48:16.073
It's kind of a Roman thing.
- And it's pretty cool.

746
00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:17.950
You're not gonna find much here.

747
00:48:18.034 --> 00:48:19.619
It's a graveyard.

748
00:48:19.786 --> 00:48:22.913
Mr. Metro City's first day
and he's already an expert.

749
00:48:22.997 --> 00:48:25.958
You'd be surprised,
I know a thing or two about robots.

750
00:48:26.041 --> 00:48:27.876
Hey, guys, I think we got something!

751
00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.960
See?
Coming!

752
00:48:31.837 --> 00:48:33.840
Hey, what's the matter, boy?

753
00:48:43.642 --> 00:48:45.934
Unless, makes me a wish, I could read.

754
00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:49.062
Nice try, Rust Bucket!

755
00:48:50.648 --> 00:48:51.274
Whoa!

756
00:48:51.357 --> 00:48:53.984
Cora! Hey!
I think I found something!

757
00:48:57.779 --> 00:48:59.782
That's just an old robot construction...

758
00:48:59.865 --> 00:49:02.493
it fell to the surface,
like a 100 years ago.

759
00:49:02.618 --> 00:49:04.035
Do you think Ham Egg could use it?

760
00:49:04.118 --> 00:49:05.745
Yeah, if he had a robot like that...

761
00:49:05.786 --> 00:49:08.916
he'd make a fortune in the game,
but it's just junk.

762
00:49:09.041 --> 00:49:11.084
We used to have picnics in it's head.

763
00:49:11.167 --> 00:49:14.253
Just give me a minute.
- It weighs hundreds of tons!

764
00:49:14.336 --> 00:49:16.964
What you're gonna do?
Put it in your backpack?

765
00:49:18.424 --> 00:49:20.716
She'd flip if she knew what I could carry.

766
00:49:41.821 --> 00:49:42.989
Zog!

767
00:49:43.322 --> 00:49:44.907
I know, you're not dead.

768
00:49:45.074 --> 00:49:46.658
You're just pretending.

769
00:50:05.009 --> 00:50:06.428
Come on, big guy.

770
00:50:07.262 --> 00:50:08.722
Time to wake up.

771
00:50:23.068 --> 00:50:25.363
Zog, let me help you.

772
00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:28.407
Come on!

773
00:50:41.587 --> 00:50:43.880
Okay, Tiger, show me what you got.

774
00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:49.301
Hold it right there, Twinkle-Toes!

775
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:51.219
What are you?
Some kind of ice skater?

776
00:50:51.304 --> 00:50:53.931
You're planning on ballroom-dancing
with this guy?

777
00:50:54.014 --> 00:50:55.725
Or you're gonna fight him?

778
00:50:56.016 --> 00:50:58.436
That's better!
Now, hit him below the belt!

779
00:50:58.769 --> 00:51:00.896
Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!

780
00:51:00.979 --> 00:51:02.396
Now, get him in a headlock.

781
00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:04.190
And pound him! Pound him!

782
00:51:04.357 --> 00:51:05.776
Use your thumbs!

783
00:51:05.984 --> 00:51:07.152
Great! Great!

784
00:51:07.277 --> 00:51:10.112
And I think you have
the makings of a champion.

785
00:51:16.452 --> 00:51:17.871
Hi, Ham Egg!

786
00:51:17.954 --> 00:51:19.663
Sorry about your robot.

787
00:51:20.872 --> 00:51:23.292
What? Oh, him?

788
00:51:23.667 --> 00:51:25.251
He wasn't really working out, anyway.

789
00:51:25.335 --> 00:51:29.130
But, hey, this guy, is something else!

790
00:51:29.255 --> 00:51:31.968
Look at the size of it's feet.
Look at those feet!

791
00:51:32.051 --> 00:51:35.012
Not your carbon fibre
plastic junk on this guy.

792
00:51:35.095 --> 00:51:36.805
That's solid pig iron!

793
00:51:37.514 --> 00:51:38.514
Astro got it running.

794
00:51:38.598 --> 00:51:40.256
But I'm still having trouble believing it.

795
00:51:40.266 --> 00:51:43.020
Oh, it's been dead for at least a century.

796
00:51:43.103 --> 00:51:44.104
How did you do it?

797
00:51:44.187 --> 00:51:47.565
Please tell me.
How did you do it?

798
00:51:47.648 --> 00:51:50.776
I just kicked it, you know,
like a vending machine.

799
00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:52.443
Give me back my money!

800
00:51:52.819 --> 00:51:54.570
It was nothing.
- You hear that, kids?

801
00:51:54.612 --> 00:51:56.030
A genius... modesty.

802
00:51:56.072 --> 00:51:58.367
I didn't think it occured in nature.

803
00:51:58.743 --> 00:52:01.286
You're almost too good to be true, kid.

804
00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:04.206
Keep this up and
I may just have to adopt you.

805
00:52:07.542 --> 00:52:08.710
Holy cow!

806
00:52:08.877 --> 00:52:11.503
This thing's got enough to run a city.

807
00:52:12.045 --> 00:52:15.008
Whoa, what's that?
- Oh, nothing, son.

808
00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.718
Just another machine with mind of it's own.

809
00:52:20.303 --> 00:52:22.057
<b>Alright performed by Supergrass</b>

810
00:52:23.141 --> 00:52:24.142
Ready, guys?

811

And you were...

827
00:53:51.807 --> 00:53:53.100
How did you do that?

828
00:53:53.183 --> 00:53:54.476
I'm faster than I look.

Everybody's saying,

832
00:54:09.073 --> 00:54:10.367
Limburger!

833
00:54:19.584 --> 00:54:21.293
Good night, Zog.

834
00:54:22.754 --> 00:54:24.172
Hey, Trash Can.

835
00:54:25.171 --> 00:54:26.464
You wanna play?

836
00:54:28.842 --> 00:54:30.427
Fetch!

837
00:54:32.345 --> 00:54:33.513
Oops!

838
00:54:40.687 --> 00:54:41.854
Hey!

839
00:54:42.647 --> 00:54:45.482
Hey, are you there?

840
00:54:49.487 --> 00:54:53.031
Hey, you should not scare people!

841
00:54:53.115 --> 00:54:56.369
How is your head?
- I think it's fine.

842
00:54:57.036 --> 00:55:01.915
Sometimes, when the sky is clear,
you can call Metro City.

843
00:55:01.998 --> 00:55:04.000
You call Metro City?

844
00:55:04.375 --> 00:55:07.755
Yes, haven't you ever call and hang up?

845
00:55:08.547 --> 00:55:12.091
This phone is not working!

846
00:55:13.009 --> 00:55:16.136
I will try...
- Okay, try...

847
00:55:20.641 --> 00:55:22.644
Okay, take it.

848
00:55:22.727 --> 00:55:25.146
It's not like new, but it has a signal...

849
00:55:26.188 --> 00:55:29.025
It's not bad.
You are talanted.

850
00:55:29.108 --> 00:55:30.818
Oh, yes.

851
00:55:32.402 --> 00:55:34.404
Oh, please pick up.

852
00:55:35.154 --> 00:55:37.282
That's me, Cora...

853
00:55:38.908 --> 00:55:40.660
I miss you...

854
00:55:42.703 --> 00:55:45.540
Is everything okay?
- Sometimes it's interesting to know...

855
00:55:45.707 --> 00:55:47.709
If they've noticed that I've left?

856
00:55:47.792 --> 00:55:51.336
Who?
- My parents.

857
00:55:51.503 --> 00:55:55.049
Parents?
- Exactly!

858
00:55:55.216 --> 00:55:57.217
Now you know the truth.

859
00:55:57.592 --> 00:56:01.054
What are you waiting for?
Go tell the others,

860
00:56:01.096 --> 00:56:05.600
that Cora is trying to call home.

861
00:56:05.684 --> 00:56:08.811
To find her nanny's address.

862
00:56:11.649 --> 00:56:13.233
Everyone has secrets.

863
00:56:13.358 --> 00:56:15.193
I won't tell anynody.

864
00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:16.777
You can trust me.

865
00:56:16.944 --> 00:56:20.073
I know.
You're a good guy, Astro.

866
00:56:21.532 --> 00:56:23.533
Can... can I tell you something?

867
00:56:24.201 --> 00:56:26.036
My secret.
- Sure.

868
00:56:26.286 --> 00:56:28.288
That's what friends are for, right?

869
00:56:28.955 --> 00:56:31.583
Do you ever feel like, you just don't fit?

870
00:56:32.459 --> 00:56:34.460
Like you're different to everbody else?

871
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:36.129
Kind of an outsider.

872
00:56:36.296 --> 00:56:39.842
Of course, everyone feels
like that sometimes.

873
00:56:40.009 --> 00:56:42.843
Well, the last few days
have been different for me.

874
00:56:43.177 --> 00:56:46.556
I mean, being with all you guys
and Ham Egg.

875
00:56:47.556 --> 00:56:49.850
The thing I need to tell you is, I'm a...

876
00:56:50.977 --> 00:56:52.811
I'm kind of a...

877
00:56:54.187 --> 00:56:56.816
I'm a...
- Yeah?

878
00:56:56.983 --> 00:57:01.236
I'm a... really starting to like it
here with you.

879
00:57:02.153 --> 00:57:04.448
With you guys.
- Yeah?

880
00:57:06.116 --> 00:57:08.242
Well, we like you too, Astro.

881
00:57:10.746 --> 00:57:12.456
Hey, Trash Can.

882
00:57:17.168 --> 00:57:18.585
I know, it's not the same thing...

883
00:57:18.627 --> 00:57:21.754
but isn't Ham Egg sorta like our dad now?

884
00:57:22.423 --> 00:57:24.424
Yeah, I guess.

885
00:57:31.515 --> 00:57:33.224
Robot Revolutionary Front...

886
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:34.768
transform!

887
00:57:49.823 --> 00:57:51.242
He knocked me.

888
00:57:51.408 --> 00:57:54.370
Which part of being a ninja
that you didn't understand?

889
00:57:54.537 --> 00:57:56.121
What's a ninja?

890
00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:59.542
Bring out the secret weapon.

891
00:58:11.843 --> 00:58:13.555
I've been looking for that.

892
00:58:14.848 --> 00:58:15.848
Yeah!

893
00:58:16.975 --> 00:58:18.560
Viva la robot revolution!

894
00:58:20.354 --> 00:58:22.479
<i>Today is the day,
we've all been waiting for.</i>

895
00:58:22.729 --> 00:58:25.857
Give them a hand, folks.
The kid in the red boots.

896
00:58:25.941 --> 00:58:29.069
He's the one who got this
killing machine up and running.

897
00:58:29.236 --> 00:58:31.238
Look at him... Ham Egg!

898
00:58:34.449 --> 00:58:37.076
You're a golden child.
Ham Egg really likes you.

899
00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:38.578
I like him too.

900
00:58:38.703 --> 00:58:40.704
What's he mean by "Killing Machine"?

901
00:58:40.788 --> 00:58:43.249
Well, the robots fights
until one of them is destroyed.

902
00:58:43.332 --> 00:58:45.169
What?
- Don't worry.

903
00:58:45.419 --> 00:58:46.837
Zog is gonna crush them all.

904
00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:48.755
That's what happens at the Robot Games?

905
00:58:48.838 --> 00:58:51.048
Then what did you expect?
Rock, Paper, Scissors?

906
00:58:51.132 --> 00:58:53.259
Who is the robot?
- I'm the robot!

907
00:58:53.343 --> 00:58:57.011
Who is the robot?
- I'm the robot!

908
00:58:57.094 --> 00:58:59.932
No mercy.
- No mercy!

909
00:59:00.015 --> 00:59:01.850
No mercy!
No mercy!

910
00:59:05.812 --> 00:59:08.107
Mercy?
- Nice knowing you, kid.

911
00:59:08.273 --> 00:59:10.108
I thought it was a show, not a slaughter.

912
00:59:10.191 --> 00:59:11.610
They are just robots, son.

913
00:59:11.777 --> 00:59:13.777
I thought you liked robots.
- I do.

914
00:59:13.819 --> 00:59:17.199
But at the end of the day,
they're junk waiting to happen.

915
00:59:17.282 --> 00:59:18.575
Huh?
- I know.

916
00:59:18.616 --> 00:59:21.744
Some of those most
advanced robots from Metro City...

917
00:59:21.827 --> 00:59:25.080
programmed to smile and laugh just like us.

918
00:59:25.164 --> 00:59:26.582
Really?
- Oh, yeah.

919
00:59:26.623 --> 00:59:29.042
Unfortunately, they don't have
real emotions.

920
00:59:29.292 --> 00:59:32.421
Which is why I don't have
no problem doing this!

921
00:59:38.343 --> 00:59:40.470
It works! I don't beleive it!
- What are you doing?

922
00:59:40.595 --> 00:59:42.013
I stole this from
Dr. Tenma...

923
00:59:42.054 --> 00:59:43.922
after he fired me
from the Ministry of Science!

924
00:59:43.932 --> 00:59:46.226
Oh, who cares?
Why did you do that to Astro?

925
00:59:46.268 --> 00:59:48.394
He's our friend!
- I thought, I raised you well!

926
00:59:48.435 --> 00:59:50.563
Are you blind?
He's a robot!

927
00:59:50.646 --> 00:59:51.647
He is...

928
00:59:51.981 --> 00:59:53.565
That's not true.

929
00:59:54.065 --> 00:59:54.941
It can't be true!

930
00:59:55.024 --> 00:59:57.235
Somebody programmed him to be nice.

931
00:59:57.319 --> 00:59:58.696
He's not really nice...

932
00:59:58.738 --> 01:00:01.281
he's just an incredibly powerful machine.

933
01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:04.201
But he was so...
- I know, sweetheart.

934
01:00:04.409 --> 01:00:05.994
It's gonna be tough.

935
01:00:06.244 --> 01:00:09.539
What are you gonna do with him?
- Take a wild guess.

936
01:00:16.504 --> 01:00:18.506
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!
Boys and girls!</i>

937
01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:22.134
And all you, tramps, walking in
without buying your tickets!

938
01:00:22.217 --> 01:00:26.722
Allow me to present Astro Boy!

939
01:00:29.183 --> 01:00:31.309
<i>I know... I know,
you're wondering...</i>

940
01:00:31.393 --> 01:00:34.355
<i>what a nice looking kid like that
doing in a place like this?</i>

941
01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:38.357
<i>That ain't no kid, folks.
That's a robot!</i>

942
01:00:38.566 --> 01:00:41.110
From Metro City.

943
01:00:41.361 --> 01:00:45.280
Get this, folks!
Astro personally told me...

944
01:00:45.489 --> 01:00:48.869
he doesn't think much
of our fighting robots.

945
01:00:49.953 --> 01:00:52.080
Thanks to all, bunch of sissies.

946
01:00:52.247 --> 01:00:54.666
Thinks, they're all trailer butt trash.

947
01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.208
He didn't say that.

948
01:00:56.375 --> 01:00:58.209
He didn't say, he was a robot either.

949
01:00:58.293 --> 01:01:00.921
That is what we've all been waiting for.

950
01:01:01.129 --> 01:01:05.217
A fight between the surface and Metro City!

951
01:01:06.052 --> 01:01:07.636
Let's get it on!

952
01:01:14.809 --> 01:01:16.394
I'm not fighting.

953
01:01:25.152 --> 01:01:26.446
I'm not doing this.

954
01:01:52.095 --> 01:01:53.388
Go, Astro!

955
01:02:00.894 --> 01:02:03.520
Bring out the Little Stinker.

956
01:02:07.484 --> 01:02:09.486
Wanna play with us?

957
01:02:09.653 --> 01:02:12.072
Us?
- Yes, us!

958
01:02:28.503 --> 01:02:29.798
Hey, fella!

959
01:02:36.928 --> 01:02:39.556
I have a boom-boom!

960
01:02:45.269 --> 01:02:46.020
Get him!

961
01:02:46.187 --> 01:02:48.606
Get him! Get him!
Get him! Get him!

962
01:02:55.405 --> 01:02:57.823
Stand back! We got a feather.
- What are you doing?

963
01:02:57.907 --> 01:03:00.033
And we're not afraid to use it.

964
01:03:02.703 --> 01:03:04.705
Am I spoken in haste?

965
01:03:21.137 --> 01:03:24.265
Why fight, brothers?
A great robot once said...

966
01:03:24.432 --> 01:03:26.017
Aah, my nose!

967
01:03:54.752 --> 01:03:56.588
We've located Tenma's son, sir.

968
01:03:57.713 --> 01:03:58.881
I win again.

969
01:03:59.132 --> 01:04:02.092
And now, the final challenger!

970
01:04:02.258 --> 01:04:05.929
A robot so fierce, so powerful...

971
01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:07.972
even I'm afraid of him.

972
01:04:08.764 --> 01:04:13.396
I give you... the mighty Zog!

973
01:04:13.938 --> 01:04:14.938
Oh, no!

974
01:04:15.105 --> 01:04:18.149
Let's see how Astro Boy
does aganist a robot...

975
01:04:18.233 --> 01:04:21.777
powered with same energy he's got.

976
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:24.070
I'm not fighting you, Zog.

977
01:04:27.491 --> 01:04:29.910
I mean it.
I won't fight.

978
01:04:35.122 --> 01:04:36.541
Oh, no!

979
01:04:49.679 --> 01:04:52.389
Great, I love you!
So big finale!

980
01:04:52.431 --> 01:04:54.140
I said fight!

981
01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:58.103
I won't fight.

982
01:04:58.228 --> 01:04:59.521
Fight!

983
01:04:59.772 --> 01:05:02.191
That's enough!
- What's the matter with you?

984
01:05:02.233 --> 01:05:04.527
They are just machines,
they'll do what I tell them.

985
01:05:04.610 --> 01:05:05.930
What?
I'm gonna get embarrassed...

986
01:05:05.986 --> 01:05:08.822
by some suited up hot shot from Metro City?

987
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:12.575
A 100 years old bulldozer from New Jersey?

988
01:05:12.741 --> 01:05:14.577
I don't think so!

989
01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:17.163
I'm turning your bolts off!

990
01:05:23.461 --> 01:05:24.045
Stop!

991
01:05:24.128 --> 01:05:25.546
The laws of robotics...

992
01:05:25.796 --> 01:05:30.009
you can't hurt a human.
It's been that way for 50 years.

993
01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:32.386
I'm old school!

994
01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:36.932
Look.

995
01:05:44.313 --> 01:05:46.941
What kind of robot are you?

996
01:05:49.569 --> 01:05:51.862
We failed to recruit the big pirate!

997
01:06:05.834 --> 01:06:07.544
What are they doing here?

998
01:06:07.878 --> 01:06:10.713
Seize the robot and secure the area.

999
01:06:10.797 --> 01:06:12.214
Hey!

1000
01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:14.926
Zog, stop, stop!

1001
01:06:15.093 --> 01:06:16.678
Put them down.

1002
01:06:18.888 --> 01:06:20.474
Doesn't matter anymore.

1003
01:06:22.475 --> 01:06:24.310
Okay.
- Okay.

1004
01:06:29.565 --> 01:06:33.111
I'm sorry, I tried to tell you.
- Keep moving.

1005
01:06:34.528 --> 01:06:36.362
Trash Can, no!

1006
01:06:37.363 --> 01:06:39.991
Hey, get off me, you dumb robot!

1007
01:06:40.074 --> 01:06:41.909
Get off!

1008
01:06:42.451 --> 01:06:44.287
It's okay, Trash Can.

1009
01:06:49.168 --> 01:06:51.794
<i>President Stone's approval ratings
reached new low today...</i>

1010
01:06:51.878 --> 01:06:55.047
<i>when he failed to show up for his
televised debate with Robert Logan.</i>

1011
01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:58.676
<i>The man, many have been thinking
as next President of Metro City.</i>

1012
01:06:59.343 --> 01:07:01.761
No dime dirty hippie is
gonna sit in my Oval office...

1013
01:07:01.845 --> 01:07:04.682
eat mung beans and
stinking of patchouli oil.

1014
01:07:04.766 --> 01:07:06.350
I've got the blue core.

1015
01:07:06.517 --> 01:07:09.644
My Peacemaker's gonna start
a war with the surface.

1016
01:07:09.936 --> 01:07:12.355
It's bound to get me re-elected.

1017
01:07:13.315 --> 01:07:15.608
Why the long-face, robot boy?

1018
01:07:15.983 --> 01:07:18.403
We're taking you home to your dad.

1019
01:07:18.904 --> 01:07:20.489
Care for a drink?

1020
01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.242
<i>Very funny, Mr. President.</i>

1021
01:07:32.790 --> 01:07:34.794
The experiment is over.

1022
01:07:35.044 --> 01:07:38.923
I want the blue core removed
transferred into the Peacemaker, now!

1023
01:07:39.131 --> 01:07:41.133
Will you help me unplug him?

1024
01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:43.008
This is where we created him.

1025
01:07:43.051 --> 01:07:45.595
Well, "uncreate" him!
Unplug him!

1026
01:07:45.761 --> 01:07:47.596
It's a matter of national security.

1027
01:07:47.763 --> 01:07:49.599
Let me talk to him first.

1028
01:07:52.977 --> 01:07:55.270
Hello, Dr. Elefun.
- Hello, Toby.

1029
01:07:55.646 --> 01:07:58.774
Toby? Nobody has called me
that for a while.

1030
01:07:58.857 --> 01:08:00.984
This isn't your fault, you know?

1031
01:08:01.151 --> 01:08:02.570
You're fantastic.

1032
01:08:02.736 --> 01:08:06.115
Absolutely first class, superb, wonderful.

1033
01:08:06.198 --> 01:08:07.366
Thank you.

1034
01:08:07.491 --> 01:08:10.452
You know, I tried to find
my place in the world.

1035
01:08:10.619 --> 01:08:12.913
I... I thought
I'd found it.

1036
01:08:13.079 --> 01:08:16.624
But I guess fitting in can be
a lot more complicated than it seems. huh?

1037
01:08:16.665 --> 01:08:19.084
Dear boy, if you only knew...

1038
01:08:19.459 --> 01:08:22.422
I think maybe, this is
what supposed to happen.

1039
01:08:22.714 --> 01:08:24.716
This is my destiny.

1040
01:08:26.259 --> 01:08:28.553
Buhuhu.

1041
01:08:28.678 --> 01:08:32.555
It's a machine, come on,
let's get moving people.

1042
01:08:32.722 --> 01:08:34.850
This is wrong, Tenma, you know it.

1043
01:08:35.016 --> 01:08:39.521
The President is right.
It's just a machine!

1044
01:08:40.689 --> 01:08:42.274
Goodbye, Dr. Elefun.

1045
01:08:42.983 --> 01:08:44.583
Load the blue core into The Peacekeeper.

1046
01:08:44.609 --> 01:08:47.570
I got a press conference
scheduled in ten minutes.

1047
01:09:29.109 --> 01:09:30.402
I'm sorry.

1048
01:09:30.735 --> 01:09:31.904
Don't be.

1049
01:09:32.154 --> 01:09:35.281
I'm sorry, I couldn't have been
a better Toby for you...

1050
01:09:36.115 --> 01:09:37.700
dad.

1051
01:09:40.829 --> 01:09:43.790
Well, Tenma.
Is it done?

1052
01:09:47.877 --> 01:09:49.587
It's done.

1053
01:09:55.843 --> 01:09:57.011
Good man.

1054
01:09:57.177 --> 01:10:00.013
When I'm re-elected,
you can have the funding...

1055
01:10:00.055 --> 01:10:03.015
to make as many little toys as you want.

1056
01:10:03.558 --> 01:10:04.976
No!

1057
01:10:05.728 --> 01:10:08.146
If you want the core,
you're gonna have to kill me.

1058
01:10:09.647 --> 01:10:11.943
Tenma!
- No! I created the core.

1059
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:13.527
They're gonna have to kill me.

1060
01:10:13.736 --> 01:10:16.863
Well, I think Metro City can learn
to cope without you.

1061
01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:18.239
Hand it over.

1062
01:10:20.157 --> 01:10:21.992
It appears, I don't have it!

1063
01:10:22.159 --> 01:10:23.577
Tenma!

1064
01:10:26.998 --> 01:10:28.999
Tenma, open this!

1065
01:10:30.251 --> 01:10:31.836
Open that door!

1066
01:10:32.544 --> 01:10:34.379
Oh, please.

1067
01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.009
I said, open that door!

1068
01:10:40.176 --> 01:10:42.179
Never!
- Now!

1069
01:10:44.556 --> 01:10:45.557
Lost.

1070
01:10:45.724 --> 01:10:48.683
If you want something done right,
you gotta do it yourself.

1071
01:10:54.022 --> 01:10:56.442
Wow! What...
what are you doing?

1072
01:10:56.776 --> 01:10:58.486
You may not be Toby...

1073
01:10:58.570 --> 01:11:00.154
but you're still my son.

1074
01:11:00.404 --> 01:11:01.698
Dad.

1075
01:11:06.159 --> 01:11:08.578
Now, fly.
Fly!

1076
01:11:17.128 --> 01:11:19.964
No!
No!

1077
01:11:21.925 --> 01:11:24.760
Arrest them immediately.
I want them shot for treason.

1078
01:11:25.010 --> 01:11:27.570
We're gonna have to use the Peacemaker
to get the blue core back.

1079
01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:29.057
Don't use the red core.

1080
01:11:29.099 --> 01:11:31.392
The negative energy,
we can't know how it will behave.

1081
01:11:31.559 --> 01:11:34.687
After many conflicts between
positive and negative energy...

1082
01:11:34.812 --> 01:11:36.814
the negative always prevails.

1083
01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:39.273
Look at Human history.
Look at me.

1084
01:11:39.356 --> 01:11:40.775
My point, excat!

1085
01:11:40.858 --> 01:11:42.651
Turn this thing on.
- I won't.

1086
01:11:42.693 --> 01:11:44.904
I have 50 reporters waiting outside!

1087
01:11:44.946 --> 01:11:47.575
Turn it on.
- You don't understand the technology!

1088
01:11:47.616 --> 01:11:48.784
Technology?

1089
01:11:48.826 --> 01:11:50.660
Who cares about technology?

1090
01:11:50.702 --> 01:11:52.412
Who understands technology?

1091
01:11:52.453 --> 01:11:55.081
It's a robot, it will do what I say.

1092
01:11:56.998 --> 01:11:58.833
Red core loaded.

1093
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.003
You ready to do as you're told?

1094
01:12:01.170 --> 01:12:03.172
You ready to rock and roll?

1095
01:12:03.213 --> 01:12:04.214
Sir?

1096
01:12:04.422 --> 01:12:08.802
Destroy the boy robot,
bring back the blue core.

1097
01:12:12.764 --> 01:12:13.932
What are you? Deaf?

1098
01:12:14.098 --> 01:12:16.518
I told you to destroy the boy robot...

1099
01:12:18.687 --> 01:12:21.648
And bring back the blue core.

1100
01:12:21.939 --> 01:12:23.941
Everybody out!
Now!

1101
01:12:25.235 --> 01:12:26.235
Move it!

1102
01:12:33.867 --> 01:12:35.160
Uh, sorry, guys...

1103
01:12:35.201 --> 01:12:38.164
I'm getting word that President Stone
may be slightly delayed.

1104
01:12:47.797 --> 01:12:49.382
Is this thing on?

1105
01:12:51.634 --> 01:12:53.344
What? Where are you going?

1106
01:12:53.511 --> 01:12:56.346
Come back!
- Monster, stand down!

1107
01:12:56.471 --> 01:12:58.891
By order of President Stone.

1108
01:13:02.479 --> 01:13:05.731
This is the life, buddy.
Smooth sail.

1109
01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:10.152
Sorry, guys.
- Oh, no!

1110
01:13:10.235 --> 01:13:14.447
It's that crazy flying kid again!
- I'm a robot, just like you.

1111
01:13:15.114 --> 01:13:16.564
What are you doing all the way out here?

1112
01:13:16.574 --> 01:13:19.119
We got tried of the rat-race.
We dropped out.

1113
01:13:19.161 --> 01:13:21.995
We're trying to live more naturally,
you know, like real birds.

1114
01:13:23.664 --> 01:13:26.083
What's that?
- You know what humans are like!

1115
01:13:26.208 --> 01:13:29.170
New Year's? 4th of July?
Mother's Day?

1116
01:13:29.337 --> 01:13:31.630
We gotta do something!
- What? Help the humans?

1117
01:13:31.714 --> 01:13:33.131
We are robots.
It's not our problem.

1118
01:13:33.173 --> 01:13:36.302
Yeah, forget about them.
What ever they did for us?

1119
01:13:43.433 --> 01:13:44.434
He's right.

1120
01:13:44.517 --> 01:13:47.144
According to the laws of robotics,
we gotta go help.

1121
01:13:47.686 --> 01:13:51.899
A Squeezy bottle's gotta do,
what a Squeezy bottle's gotta do.

1122
01:13:57.446 --> 01:13:59.573
<i>Where you are?</i>

1123
01:14:08.457 --> 01:14:12.001
<i>Where are you, robot boy?</i>

1124
01:14:15.713 --> 01:14:17.131
Oh, no!

1125
01:14:21.387 --> 01:14:23.221
There you are.

1126
01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:35.565
What?
But...

1127
01:14:36.483 --> 01:14:38.068
Huh, cool!

1128
01:14:50.287 --> 01:14:51.873
That has to be Astro.

1129
01:14:51.998 --> 01:14:53.708
I don't care if he's a robot.

1130
01:14:53.875 --> 01:14:56.169
I miss him.
- I hear ya.

1131
01:14:59.130 --> 01:15:02.091
When the going gets tough,
smart people take a hike.

1132
01:15:02.174 --> 01:15:03.466
Bye-bye, kids.

1133
01:15:03.966 --> 01:15:05.552
What do you want?
An apology?

1134
01:15:05.635 --> 01:15:09.723
Nope, just the car.
- I would love oblige you, but...

1135
01:15:12.768 --> 01:15:15.604
Come on, I love you, guys.
Please.

1136
01:15:16.313 --> 01:15:18.148
Freaking robots!

1137
01:15:22.902 --> 01:15:23.903
Gotcha!

1138
01:15:32.786 --> 01:15:35.206
The city elected me!

1139
01:15:35.372 --> 01:15:38.208
I own it.
It's mine!

1140
01:15:47.842 --> 01:15:49.718
Hey! I'm voting for
the other guy!

1141
01:15:49.761 --> 01:15:50.762
What?

1142
01:15:57.101 --> 01:15:59.102
Thank you.
Anytime you need me.

1143
01:16:12.657 --> 01:16:13.950
What?

1144
01:16:15.577 --> 01:16:18.955
I got machine guns... in my butt?

1145
01:16:21.498 --> 01:16:22.917
You gotta be kidding me.

1146
01:16:23.042 --> 01:16:24.335
Batter up!

1147
01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:30.675
Homerun!

1148
01:16:50.192 --> 01:16:52.486
Astro?
- Cora!

1149
01:16:53.571 --> 01:16:54.989
Thanks, guys.

1150
01:16:55.156 --> 01:16:57.159
Hey, who's driving?

1151
01:17:05.165 --> 01:17:07.000
Trash can, faster!

1152
01:17:08.376 --> 01:17:09.669
Move over!

1153
01:17:35.568 --> 01:17:37.862
Are we going up?
- No, the city is falling down.

1154
01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:41.575
Cora, I've to take care of this.
- Astro, no.

1155
01:17:42.158 --> 01:17:43.452
Astro!

1156
01:17:49.666 --> 01:17:50.959
Look.

1157
01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:06.014
Fighting comrades, to arms!

1158
01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.725
I've got three arms.

1159
01:18:23.448 --> 01:18:24.449
Where is he?

1160
01:18:24.616 --> 01:18:27.450
Is he really be okay?
- I hope so.

1161
01:18:33.458 --> 01:18:35.167
Hey, ugly!

1162
01:18:36.001 --> 01:18:37.295
Down here.

1163
01:18:37.670 --> 01:18:40.339
We demand immediately that
you cease oppressing...

1164
01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:41.965
our Comrade Astro.

1165
01:18:42.048 --> 01:18:44.050
We may not be allowed to harm humans...

1166
01:18:44.091 --> 01:18:44.967
but there's nothing that say...

1167
01:18:45.009 --> 01:18:48.679
we can't do some
serious damage to a monster.

1168
01:18:48.721 --> 01:18:50.432
Aye, comrades?

1169
01:18:53.976 --> 01:18:55.686
Oh, look over there.

1170
01:18:57.439 --> 01:19:01.317
Where are you, robot boy?
I know you're still alive.

1171
01:19:01.567 --> 01:19:03.569
You can't hide from...

1172
01:19:07.781 --> 01:19:09.366
That all you got?

1173
01:19:17.332 --> 01:19:18.499
Come here!

1174
01:19:21.627 --> 01:19:25.715
The party's over, kid.
Blue core obtained.

1175
01:19:46.693 --> 01:19:47.861
Toby!

1176
01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:50.447
Dad.

1177
01:19:51.739 --> 01:19:54.701
I don't understand.
Why didn't it absorb me?

1178
01:19:54.784 --> 01:19:55.785
Because it can't.

1179
01:19:55.868 --> 01:19:59.413
If the red and blue core
come together, well...

1180
01:19:59.664 --> 01:20:01.248
you both die.

1181
01:20:02.624 --> 01:20:05.294
Come on, son, we need to get far away.

1182
01:20:06.129 --> 01:20:07.837
Where are you, Astro?

1183
01:20:10.089 --> 01:20:12.717
Where is your robot friend?
Where is he?

1184
01:20:14.094 --> 01:20:17.638
I got an election to win.
And I want that core.

1185
01:20:21.268 --> 01:20:23.270
Where is he hiding?
Tell me!

1186
01:20:23.478 --> 01:20:25.480
You hear me?
Where is he?

1187
01:20:25.771 --> 01:20:28.607
We have to go.
- This is it.

1188
01:20:29.149 --> 01:20:31.150
This is what I was created for.

1189
01:20:31.276 --> 01:20:33.695
This... is my destiny.

1190
01:20:33.862 --> 01:20:35.030
Toby, now!

1191
01:20:35.197 --> 01:20:37.491
I'm sorry, but this is who I am.

1192
01:20:37.992 --> 01:20:39.536
Onward and upward...

1193
01:20:40.453 --> 01:20:41.328
Dad.

1194
01:20:41.453 --> 01:20:42.620
No!

1195
01:20:44.373 --> 01:20:46.666
Huh, you're back for more?

1196
01:20:54.215 --> 01:20:56.842
Wait, wait!
No-no... wait, wait!

1197
01:21:00.345 --> 01:21:01.512
No!

1198
01:21:11.816 --> 01:21:13.525
My son.
- Dad.

1199
01:21:20.489 --> 01:21:22.616
Get out of me.
No!

1200
01:21:23.827 --> 01:21:25.411
Get out!

1201
01:21:25.870 --> 01:21:27.996
Get us out of here.
- I'm trying.

1202
01:21:30.167 --> 01:21:31.876
No! No!

1203
01:21:33.627 --> 01:21:35.461
Oh, nuts!

1204
01:21:44.012 --> 01:21:45.305
Son.

1205
01:22:06.324 --> 01:22:07.784
Guards, seize this girl immediately!

1206
01:22:07.867 --> 01:22:09.828
She kicked me.
She kept kicking me.

1207
01:22:09.870 --> 01:22:12.163
President Stone, sir.
You're under arrest.

1208
01:22:12.247 --> 01:22:15.500
No, you can't do this to me.
I got an election to win.

1209
01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:17.085
Astro?
- Astro?

1210
01:22:17.210 --> 01:22:19.629
Astro?
- Astro?

1211
01:22:22.507 --> 01:22:24.217
Astro!

1212
01:22:26.719 --> 01:22:28.304
Oh, no!

1213
01:22:31.265 --> 01:22:33.267
Oh, Astro.

1214
01:22:34.185 --> 01:22:37.020
Who was he?
- That robot saved the Metro city.

1215
01:22:37.104 --> 01:22:38.521
Why would he care?

1216
01:22:38.688 --> 01:22:41.233
Because that robot had more humanity...

1217
01:22:41.316 --> 01:22:42.901
than most of us.

1218
01:22:43.317 --> 01:22:45.737
Who are you?
- I'm a friend of his.

1219
01:22:45.988 --> 01:22:48.949
From the surface.
- You're from the surface?

1220
01:22:53.745 --> 01:22:56.873
Can you fix him?
- No. I'm afraid, no.

1221
01:22:57.039 --> 01:22:59.667
His blue core was unique.

1222
01:23:00.334 --> 01:23:03.795
Now it's died with him.
- It's not fair.

1223
01:23:03.962 --> 01:23:05.798
All he ever did was help people.

1224
01:23:05.881 --> 01:23:07.882
Not just people.

1225
01:23:09.592 --> 01:23:11.597
Astro brought Zog back to life.

1226
01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:14.306
How?
- The blue stuff.

1227
01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:18.393
Do... do you have any of that
blue stuff left?

1228
01:23:19.644 --> 01:23:22.605
Do you think, you could spare
some for our friend here?

1229
01:23:58.181 --> 01:23:59.348
Dad!

1230
01:23:59.473 --> 01:24:00.641
Cora!

1231
01:24:00.976 --> 01:24:03.103
What happened?
Is the Peacekeeper gone?

1232
01:24:03.145 --> 01:24:04.437
Yes.

1233
01:24:09.107 --> 01:24:11.234
But... How am I still...

1234
01:24:15.865 --> 01:24:18.700
Thank you, Zog.
- No big deal.

1235
01:24:26.832 --> 01:24:27.833
Astro...

1236
01:24:27.916 --> 01:24:31.296
I think you finally found
your place in the world.

1237
01:24:31.463 --> 01:24:35.675
You are a hero.
A robot with the heart of a lion.

1238
01:24:35.758 --> 01:24:37.760
And everyone finally knows it.

1239
01:24:45.225 --> 01:24:47.853
I love happy endings.

1240
01:24:48.562 --> 01:24:50.563
Would you?
- Sure.

1241
01:24:50.897 --> 01:24:52.065
Thanks.

1242
01:24:52.607 --> 01:24:54.193
Cora?

1243
01:24:54.526 --> 01:24:56.110
Cora!
- Cora!

1244
01:24:56.277 --> 01:24:58.695
Mom? Dad?
- Where have you been, sweetie?

1245
01:24:58.779 --> 01:25:01.408
We've searched high and low for you.
- Really?

1246
01:25:06.453 --> 01:25:08.581
Viva la robot revolution!

1247
01:25:09.081 --> 01:25:11.082
It's looks-like all the
interesting stuff's over.

1248
01:25:11.124 --> 01:25:14.085
How typical! Just typical.
- Thanks for your help, guys.

1249
01:25:14.126 --> 01:25:17.256
Oh, it was nothing.
- Yeah, when you think about it, Sparxy.

1250
01:25:17.297 --> 01:25:19.591
It really was nothing.

1251
01:25:19.675 --> 01:25:21.802
Are you trying to upset me?

1252
01:25:22.969 --> 01:25:25.263
Will you be wanting the car, sir?

1253
01:25:25.346 --> 01:25:28.182
I don't want you to
call me "Sir" anymore, Orrin.

1254
01:25:28.224 --> 01:25:29.808
In fact, take the day off.

1255
01:25:29.891 --> 01:25:33.437
Go on and enjoy yourself
with the robot ladies.

1256
01:25:33.854 --> 01:25:35.981
Thank you, Dr. Tenma.

1257
01:25:36.023 --> 01:25:37.732
Call me Bill.

1258
01:25:39.693 --> 01:25:41.695
I'm so freaked right now.

1259
01:25:46.658 --> 01:25:47.951
Everybody, take cover!

1260
01:25:47.993 --> 01:25:49.994
We're under an alien attack!

1261
01:25:52.164 --> 01:25:54.791
Wait! Are you sure
you're ready for this, Astro?

1262
01:25:54.874 --> 01:25:56.875
I was made ready!
