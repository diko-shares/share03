WEBVTT

1
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:47,958
We shall go on to the end,

2
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:50,316
we shall fight in France,

3
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:52,244
we shall fight on the seas and oceans,

4
00:00:53,207 --> 00:00:58,042
we shall fight with growing confidence
and growing strength in the air,

5
00:00:58,087 --> 00:01:02,239
we shall defend our island,
whatever the cost may be,

6
00:01:02,287 --> 00:01:04,403
we shall fight on the beaches,

7
00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:07,041
we shall fight on the landing grounds,

8
00:01:07,087 --> 00:01:10,682
we shall fight in the fields
and in the streets,

9
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:13,764
we shall fight in the hills,
we shall never surrender.

10
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:40,163
lt's January 28th 2008
and l'm at Stansted Airport in England.

11
00:03:40,207 --> 00:03:44,120
l'm here because my favourite band,
lron Maiden, has invited us

12
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:47,796
to film the first leg of their
Somewhere Back ln Time world tour.

13
00:03:47,847 --> 00:03:52,045
This tour is based on the classic
World Slavery tour from 1985,

14
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:54,442
which is back when l first became a fan.

15
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:57,558
That's a thing of beauty.

16
00:03:57,607 --> 00:04:00,917
Over the next six weeks,
we'll travel 40,000 miles

17
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:05,722
on lron Maiden's
private 757, Ed Force One,

18
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:09,885
and watch them play 21 cities
in 12 countries across 4 continents.

19
00:04:09,927 --> 00:04:14,045
That's an average distance
of 2,000 miles between each show.

20
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,964
And what's even more impressive

21
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:19,079
is that lead singer Bruce Dickinson
is flying the plane.

22
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:23,040
The aeroplane idea started off
as a crazy gleam in my eye.

23
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:28,639
l went, ''Wow, if you could get
all your gear into an aeroplane,

24
00:04:28,687 --> 00:04:32,680
''you could cut down hugely on the amount
of dead space we have in touring.''

25
00:04:32,727 --> 00:04:34,763
So l said, ''What if you join up

26
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:39,642
''all the countries that accountants say,
'You can't go there, it costs too much'?''

27
00:04:39,687 --> 00:04:42,360
And we just join them up. And we go...

28
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,683
Yes, we can,
'cause we've got our own magic carpet.

29
00:04:45,727 --> 00:04:48,161
The idea of especially modifying a plane

30
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:52,280
to take the band, 70 crew,
and over 12 tons of equipment,

31
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:53,999
has never been attempted before.

32
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:58,120
This could be the most ambitious tour
in rock history

33
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:01,284
and everyone seems a little nervous
to see if they can pull it off.

34
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:04,399
When you're going round the world
and you're trying to combine

35
00:05:04,447 --> 00:05:06,756
passenger and freight on the same plane,

36
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,002
on that level it's very hard.

37
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:12,596
We knew what we had to do,
we had to get the engineers involved,

38
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:14,399
to make sure the plane
could stand that stress,

39
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,517
of flying with that much freight in the back.

40
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,603
To get all of that together took a year.

41
00:05:18,647 --> 00:05:22,765
Everything else was in place.
We'd got the visas and the equipment.

42
00:05:22,807 --> 00:05:26,083
The only thing we hadn't got
was the authorization to fly the plane.

43
00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:29,642
l was the nut in the nutcracker, as it were.

44
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:31,837
Because when it came to that morning,

45
00:05:31,887 --> 00:05:37,086
and we still hadn't signed the papers
we needed to get the aeroplane airborne,

46
00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:40,437
l was in a stressful place.

47
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:44,079
Tire was a little bit flat this morning.
Not dangerously so

48
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:47,324
but just as a precaution
we put a new wheel on it.

49
00:05:49,207 --> 00:05:51,596
lt's not like Formula One.

50
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:53,638
ls that the young man
who brought the wine?

51
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:54,676
Yeah.

52
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:57,161
Take your hands out of your pocket.

53
00:05:57,207 --> 00:05:59,243
How come we shouldn't have
our hands in our pockets?

54
00:05:59,287 --> 00:06:01,847
'Cause it shows a slovenly attitude,

55
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:07,439
the type of attitude that is easily
displayed by ex-colonialists like you lot.

56
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:09,762
lan, what did you tell me to do

57
00:06:09,807 --> 00:06:13,641
with the documentary people
if they annoyed me?

58
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:15,882
He said l've got to be nice to you.

59
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:20,478
lron Maiden's always been a band that's
maintained their privacy over the years.

60
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:25,396
They've never had a camera crew
come into their lives, who are outsiders.

61
00:06:25,447 --> 00:06:28,405
And we don't really know what to expect.

62
00:06:32,247 --> 00:06:33,566
Turn that off.

63
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,958
Good morning. Welcome to Stansted.

64
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:41,327
Who's he? Who are you?

65
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:45,998
As we drove into the airport

66
00:06:46,047 --> 00:06:49,357
there was you guys with the cameras

67
00:06:49,407 --> 00:06:51,875
and Rob was telling us to be nice to you.

68
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:53,883
''Get that camera out of my face!''

69
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:56,282
Right, come here!

70
00:06:57,327 --> 00:06:59,363
l didn't sleep a lot the night before.

71
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:02,843
lt's like going on holiday
when you were a kid,

72
00:07:02,887 --> 00:07:06,357
and getting anxious and don't want
to go to bed, just want to go away.

73
00:07:06,407 --> 00:07:09,399
Oh, yes, here we go! Ed Force One!

74
00:07:09,447 --> 00:07:10,436
You all right?

75
00:07:10,487 --> 00:07:12,125
You frickin' beauty!

76
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:14,635
And you've got a whole case on there.

77
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,645
l must admit l was a bit sceptical about it all.

78
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,520
The idea of band and crew
travelling on the same plane.

79
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:24,355
lt's like a trip away in a coach,
a few cans of beer in the back,

80
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:29,037
like a day trip,
except that it lasted six weeks.

81
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:32,602
The only time we'd ever travelled with
a crew was back in the late '70s,

82
00:07:32,647 --> 00:07:35,957
where, basically,
there was only one crew member.

83
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:37,565
There was the band and one guy.

84
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:40,167
l think it's something to look forward to.

85
00:07:40,207 --> 00:07:43,756
All crews are maniacs, and ours have
got their share of characters.

86
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:45,763
No interviews. Tax purposes.

87
00:07:45,807 --> 00:07:50,164
You're not allowed in this section.
l'm sorry. You haven't got a special pass.

88
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:52,323
They got the rubber stamp of approval.

89
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:54,756
Yeah, we're all strapped down

90
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:59,085
and palleted and fire-bagged
and everything else.

91
00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:02,721
- And we're good to go.
- We're good to go.

92
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:05,406
Everything was just going swimmingly

93
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:07,119
and l was sat on the flight deck going,

94
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,239
''There are so many things
that could go wrong.

95
00:08:10,287 --> 00:08:14,599
''Just take a deep breath
and wait till they close all the holds.''

96
00:08:14,647 --> 00:08:18,003
And then we can go.
Four hours 45 is the flying time.

97
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:19,605
A bit windy when we get to Baku.

98
00:08:19,647 --> 00:08:24,721
And then a stonking power wind'll take us
to Mumbai. Three hours 47 to Mumbai.

99
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:27,486
Plenty of time to drink
Nicko's bottles of wine.

100
00:08:27,527 --> 00:08:31,361
See you later, and we'll get ourselves
under way. All right? Bye for now.

101
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:34,205
..and you know you are!

102
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:37,319
You're shit and you know you are!

103
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:41,163
Five star 666 to Sierra 1 .
Clear for takeoff.

104
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:42,959
Wind 290. Ten knots.

105
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,805
Clear for takeoff, Flight 666.

106
00:08:57,007 --> 00:08:59,396
l've done plenty of take-offs in Boeing 757 s,

107
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:02,359
but this particular one was rather special.

108
00:09:02,407 --> 00:09:06,082
l was so glad to get the wheels up
and get under way.

109
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:09,881
London five star 666 passing 2,800 feet.

110
00:09:09,927 --> 00:09:12,680
Everybody was chuffed to bits
on the aeroplane.

111
00:09:12,727 --> 00:09:16,356
The seats were all comfy and
the road crew couldn't believe the leg room

112
00:09:16,407 --> 00:09:20,036
and then the cabin crew
started serving the drinks and the grub.

113
00:09:20,087 --> 00:09:24,000
Everybody was like, ''Yeah, great!
This is the way to do it!''

114
00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:42,486
Since getting here on Thursday,

115
00:09:42,527 --> 00:09:47,476
the band's been mobbed by young rock
fans keen to get a look at their heroes.

116
00:09:47,527 --> 00:09:50,917
Although lron Maiden struggle to get
any radio airplay back home,

117
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:53,322
they still fill stadiums around the world.

118
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:56,723
This new plane means
they can play more shows in more countries

119
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:58,564
than any other group can.

120
00:09:58,607 --> 00:10:00,245
Despite being around for decades,

121
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:04,485
lron Maiden are spearheading
a new wave of hard rock in lndia.

122
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:07,519
Teenagers fed up
with mass-market Bollywood music

123
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:10,525
are buying into heavy metal in a big way.

124
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:12,717
Sky News, Mumbai.

125
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:15,327
Are you happy?

126
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:17,198
lt's not even funny, man!

127
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,125
Shit. Shit, man.

128
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:33,237
Maiden!

129
00:10:35,127 --> 00:10:36,924
This tour for us

130
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:41,882
is a retrospective look
at a classic period in the band's history.

131
00:10:41,927 --> 00:10:44,725
We're playing songs
we haven't played in 23 years.

132
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:47,076
But, most importantly, for an audience

133
00:10:47,127 --> 00:10:51,757
which has never seen us
perform these songs,

134
00:10:51,807 --> 00:10:53,126
this is a real treat.

135
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:57,638
lt's every guy's dream to be a rock star
and you guys are living that dream.

136
00:10:57,687 --> 00:11:02,920
So can you give us a little insight
about what it's like backstage on tour,

137
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:05,765
the kind of stuff
you wouldn't want us to know?

138
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:09,277
lf we told you,
then you'd know, wouldn't you?

139
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:13,998
Yeah, we could tell you
but we'd have to kill you.

140
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:25,356
So how did you first discover lron Maiden?

141
00:11:25,407 --> 00:11:27,967
At my friend's uncle's place.

142
00:11:28,007 --> 00:11:32,125
l saw this Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son
cassette box over there.

143
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:35,125
And l just freaked out on the artwork,
to be honest.

144
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:40,400
lt was love at first listen. l just got hooked
onto Maiden, just like that.

145
00:11:40,447 --> 00:11:43,519
And l haven't looked behind ever since.

146
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:45,046
Maiden!

147
00:11:46,447 --> 00:11:49,519
The first time we played in lndia
was in Bangalore

148
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:53,003
and we were absolutely
knocked sideways by the reaction.

149
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:56,960
lt's a 20,000-seat outdoor venue, and
there were 50,000 people wanting to get in.

150
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,805
lt was reminiscent of 1984,

151
00:11:59,847 --> 00:12:02,202
when we played behind the lron Curtain
for the first time

152
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:03,521
and we were besieged.

153
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:07,037
This is the first major metal band
which has played in lndia.

154
00:12:07,087 --> 00:12:10,079
The crowd are waiting here
from six o'clock in the morning.

155
00:12:10,127 --> 00:12:13,597
More and more kids
get inspired by the metal scene.

156
00:12:13,647 --> 00:12:16,844
They start getting into playing guitar,
drums and forming bands,

157
00:12:16,887 --> 00:12:19,321
and something will come out of it
in years to come.

158
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:20,641
Bruce, you rock!

159
00:12:20,687 --> 00:12:25,078
Best band in the world.
Always will be. Up the lrons.

160
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:14,083
- Nice one, mate.
- Painless sound check.

161
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,276
That worked nice, didn't it?

162
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:18,637
- lt went really nice.
- l can really hear you well now.

163
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:21,645
l'll keep it, though,
cos it really is a fail-safe.

164
00:13:21,687 --> 00:13:23,006
l'll turn it up if you like.

165
00:13:23,047 --> 00:13:26,403
The first show was lndia.
What were your feelings going into that?

166
00:13:26,447 --> 00:13:30,884
To be totally honest with you, l was
more frightened of getting up on that stage

167
00:13:30,927 --> 00:13:34,237
than l was getting inside a 757
with a bunch of hooligans

168
00:13:34,287 --> 00:13:35,766
and all our gear in the back.

169
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:38,401
We got to the venue
and the stage was built from wood.

170
00:13:38,447 --> 00:13:41,678
The stage was lashed-together bamboo.

171
00:13:41,727 --> 00:13:45,117
We were going round testing it
but it was really solid.

172
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:50,525
The backstage thing where everything's
like red carpets and great big tents,

173
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:52,956
it's almost like
being back in the Raj or something.

174
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,759
Maiden! Maiden! Maiden!

175
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:22,441
All right?

176
00:16:22,487 --> 00:16:25,445
Can we switch the air conditioning off,
please?

177
00:16:25,487 --> 00:16:26,920
Let's go.

178
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:31,636
l'll tell you what amazed me.
Madness went down a storm.

179
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:34,679
l know, l know. Which is unusual.

180
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,558
Beer!

181
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,280
Obviously got very good taste in music.

182
00:16:41,327 --> 00:16:44,478
Five beers is not enough
for an hour journey.

183
00:16:44,527 --> 00:16:49,317
l said to the tour manager, ''Five beers for
five people for an hour journey isn't enough.

184
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:50,686
''lt's pathetic.''

185
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:52,797
- l'm sure we can afford it.
- Note to self.

186
00:16:52,847 --> 00:16:55,919
l can't talk very well
'cause my mouth's so dry.

187
00:16:57,247 --> 00:16:58,919
So bear with me.

188
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:02,118
Look, boys and girls,
this is what it's like after a gig in a van.

189
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:06,638
We post-mortem the gig for ten seconds,
make apologies to one another...

190
00:17:06,687 --> 00:17:07,676
Then we argue.

191
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:11,117
And then we argue about ice cream vans
and stuff!

192
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,283
lt was a little jagged tonight. Got through it.

193
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:18,162
l thought l might collapse halfway through.
l ran out of steam. l'm an old man.

194
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:21,845
Oh, dear. We've still got the police escort.

195
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:24,447
He's the only vehicle holding us up.

196
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:27,482
Oh, man.

197
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:40,516
Passengers travelling
on lron Maiden Flight AEU666

198
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:43,843
kindly board the aircraft
at gate number four, thank you.

199
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:46,720
That's what l'm saying. l don't...

200
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:52,243
..will be served in-flight.
Please observe the fasten seat belt signs

201
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:54,960
and no smoking signs...

202
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:59,206
You're shit and you know you are!

203
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:03,003
You're shit and you know you are!

204
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:06,001
You're shit and you know you are!

205
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:09,479
You're shit and you know you are!

206
00:18:21,287 --> 00:18:24,165
l've got to slow down
'cause the arm's hanging off now.

207
00:18:33,287 --> 00:18:35,801
lt's like watching a rare wild animal.

208
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:39,203
Even in its sleep, it snarls and it growls,

209
00:18:39,247 --> 00:18:42,444
unaware of the presence of the cameras.

210
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:45,240
Rod is the best rock and roll manager
in the world,

211
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:48,836
who is not just about the money
and the fame and the bullshit.

212
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:51,879
lt's about integrity and, ''We did it our way.''

213
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:54,999
He's such a bombastic guy,
which is what you want as a manager.

214
00:18:55,047 --> 00:18:58,676
Sometimes he's bombastic
with us as well at times.

215
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:01,241
We all moan about him
but we love him dearly,

216
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:03,847
and he's a very hard-edged person.

217
00:19:03,887 --> 00:19:08,597
He's a Yorkshireman.
''Don't bloody talk about that! Come here!''

218
00:19:10,087 --> 00:19:12,317
Bloody Roderick Smallwood!

219
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:14,835
He's brilliant when he bursts into the room.

220
00:19:15,927 --> 00:19:17,758
l thought that was him.

221
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:20,676
And it's awake. We've woken it up.

222
00:19:23,847 --> 00:19:25,599
Fat chance of sleeping.

223
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:19,157
Saxon's radar, good afternoon...

224
00:20:21,327 --> 00:20:23,318
Could you sign this?

225
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,962
- Maiden! Maiden!
- All right?

226
00:20:31,127 --> 00:20:32,276
So where are we?

227
00:20:32,327 --> 00:20:35,717
We're at the Corner Hotel in Australia
for the lron Maiden Melbourne meet-up.

228
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,565
So why do you have
these pre-show events?

229
00:20:38,607 --> 00:20:42,316
Just to get together, have fun, have
some drinks and enjoy the atmosphere.

230
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,245
'Cause we're all pumped for Maiden.

231
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:48,165
This is David from Melbourne,
mate, a real fucking Maiden fan.

232
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:53,964
lt's not so much about identity or whatever
social culture you think you fit into.

233
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:57,317
lf you could see all these different types
of people that come along to gigs

234
00:20:57,367 --> 00:20:59,961
and worship upon the altar
that is lron Maiden,

235
00:21:00,007 --> 00:21:03,886
they have this ability to really hit your heart

236
00:21:03,927 --> 00:21:08,364
and either that or it makes you want
to headbang and go fucking wild.

237
00:21:08,407 --> 00:21:10,398
How long have you been Maiden fans?

238
00:21:10,447 --> 00:21:13,325
Since l was fucking born, man!

239
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:15,676
Fucking day 666!

240
00:21:17,727 --> 00:21:19,957
lt's been 15 years
since we played Australia.

241
00:21:20,007 --> 00:21:23,556
Everywhere we go,
the fans are so keen to have us back.

242
00:21:23,607 --> 00:21:26,758
Some people never saw us,
some people saw us on earlier tours.

243
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:29,526
But absolutely incredible everywhere.

244
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:31,398
We're bigger than ever.

245
00:21:31,447 --> 00:21:34,962
Our heyday was the mid-'80s,
which is what this tour is all about.

246
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:36,804
We're 24, 25 years older,

247
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:41,796
but we get up on stage and l look out
and l see the kids and they haven't aged.

248
00:21:41,847 --> 00:21:43,360
lt's really weird.

249
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:47,923
l go, ''Look. They're the same kids that were
around in front of the stage 20 years ago.''

250
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:52,802
Why is it that Maiden appeals
to Mom and Dad and all the kids?

251
00:21:52,847 --> 00:21:53,836
Because they're cool.

252
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:56,321
Because they're fucking awesome, man!
Come on!

253
00:21:56,367 --> 00:22:00,804
l believe lron Maiden are playing here
tonight. Giddy the fuck up!

254
00:22:00,847 --> 00:22:03,077
Steve's probably flat out in bed.

255
00:22:03,127 --> 00:22:04,606
He's also down still?

256
00:22:04,647 --> 00:22:08,560
Steve's down big-time.
Yeah. He's looking really ill.

257
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:13,522
We all picked up a little bug from lndia.
Steve and l probably more so.

258
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:16,161
l mean, we didn't eat for four days.

259
00:22:16,207 --> 00:22:19,643
By the time we'd arrived in Australia
and we turned up at the sound check,

260
00:22:19,687 --> 00:22:23,999
we'd start a song, someone would be off
to the bathroom, come back and we'd start,

261
00:22:24,047 --> 00:22:26,436
and people were just off everywhere.

262
00:22:26,487 --> 00:22:30,002
We're all pretty jet-lagged still.
That jet lag is a killer.

263
00:22:30,047 --> 00:22:34,643
You've got to be ready for that concert
because those kids want a good show.

264
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:38,396
We've had buckets for both ends on stage
during some of the shows.

265
00:22:38,447 --> 00:22:42,201
Ten out of ten to the band for putting up
with that pressure and that illness,

266
00:22:42,247 --> 00:22:45,080
and going out on stage
with those conditions.

267
00:22:50,207 --> 00:22:52,926
There's always a shithouse
that you can sing in somewhere.

268
00:22:56,927 --> 00:22:59,521
Scream for me, Melbourne!

269
00:23:01,687 --> 00:23:05,316
l can't fucking hear you!
Scream for me, Melbourne!

270
00:25:06,207 --> 00:25:08,596
The ship is fucking sinking.

271
00:25:09,727 --> 00:25:13,925
Yeah, it's a bit better.
A bit better is better than worse.

272
00:25:13,967 --> 00:25:16,845
None of the places you play
are designed for music

273
00:25:16,887 --> 00:25:19,685
so you always have sound problems.

274
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:22,287
You have to just be prepared for the worst,

275
00:25:22,327 --> 00:25:27,321
and if it sounds great, all the better,
but you can't let it throw you off.

276
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:32,521
People who've paid to see you don't
give a shit if it doesn't sound good on stage.

277
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:36,242
They want to have a good time, and that's
what you've got to try and put across.

278
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:41,156
Adrian has always been a stickler
for getting the tones right that he wants.

279
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,516
He's meticulous.
He's like that in his playing.

280
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:46,764
When you listen to his guitar solos,
they're very precise.

281
00:25:46,807 --> 00:25:49,480
Adrian's guitar playing is the stitching,

282
00:25:49,527 --> 00:25:53,042
it's the texture, the fabric
that covers all the structures.

283
00:25:53,087 --> 00:25:56,204
Nothing Adrian does is aggressive, like...

284
00:25:57,647 --> 00:26:00,878
Everything lopes.
He picks notes out of the air like that.

285
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:04,966
And how he does it, no one knows,
only Adrian. 'Cause nobody else can do it.

286
00:26:07,287 --> 00:26:10,085
l'm trying to be all serious.
l probably look...

287
00:26:11,127 --> 00:26:12,719
Sorry.

288
00:26:13,727 --> 00:26:19,006
l felt like shit before l went on, and then l
got some adrenaline going and l enjoyed it.

289
00:26:19,047 --> 00:26:20,560
Contrary to belief, boys and girls,

290
00:26:20,607 --> 00:26:25,044
Harris don't smack the shit
out of his bass guitar strings, he tickles 'em.

291
00:26:25,087 --> 00:26:29,478
And l have it on good authority
he's a good tickler.

292
00:26:29,527 --> 00:26:31,438
You are talking a load of bollocks.

293
00:26:31,487 --> 00:26:34,285
More shit comes out of your mouth
than your arse, mate.

294
00:26:34,327 --> 00:26:35,680
More shit?

295
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:36,716
Actually...

296
00:26:39,527 --> 00:26:40,880
Are you coming for a drink, Steve?

297
00:26:40,927 --> 00:26:42,838
Got some nice chilli.

298
00:26:42,887 --> 00:26:45,196
Just about full.

299
00:26:45,247 --> 00:26:47,920
You're fired. You can go home.

300
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:52,046
l thought you were gonna come with me
and film me in the bloody bath.

301
00:26:52,087 --> 00:26:53,918
l have my limits.

302
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:55,366
You ought to do, mate.

303
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:56,920
Go on, bugger off, you.

304
00:26:56,967 --> 00:26:59,003
See you later.

305
00:26:59,047 --> 00:27:01,686
- Can't beat them.
- Bugger off.

306
00:27:06,247 --> 00:27:08,886
l don't like being part of the group
all the time.

307
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:11,760
You need to be out, be an individual.
lt keeps you fresh.

308
00:27:11,807 --> 00:27:15,959
So when you've got the show the next day,
you're not all hung-over.

309
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:18,603
There he is.

310
00:27:18,647 --> 00:27:20,922
Oh, my God.

311
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:22,605
How are you, mate?

312
00:27:24,527 --> 00:27:27,758
l reckon l've known the guys for 25 years.

313
00:27:27,807 --> 00:27:33,518
Their first tour here in Australia, Number
Of The Beast, we played tennis with them.

314
00:27:34,967 --> 00:27:38,004
We've been friends ever since, really.

315
00:27:38,647 --> 00:27:40,683
This is not easy.

316
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:43,685
Again.

317
00:27:44,727 --> 00:27:46,797
Adrian a worthy opponent there, Pat?

318
00:27:46,847 --> 00:27:49,680
A much better tennis player
than l am a guitarist.

319
00:27:49,727 --> 00:27:51,365
We got a chance to play Pat Cash,

320
00:27:51,407 --> 00:27:55,480
we had also Wayne Arthurs.
He had the fastest serve record for a while.

321
00:27:55,527 --> 00:27:59,076
l had the audacity
to try and return one of his serves.

322
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:05,037
l was put firmly in my place.

323
00:28:05,087 --> 00:28:07,123
That's in the movie.

324
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:14,797
Now, didn't you?

325
00:28:16,047 --> 00:28:18,083
l'm gonna get your camera.

326
00:28:19,647 --> 00:28:21,956
When you're on the road
as much as we are,

327
00:28:22,007 --> 00:28:25,602
you don't want to sit in your hotel room
and mope or watch movies.

328
00:28:25,647 --> 00:28:30,038
Everyone has their own activities
that they do. l think it keeps you sane.

329
00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:33,841
Get out of the bloody way!
Get out of the bloody line!

330
00:28:33,887 --> 00:28:38,039
A lot of bands go out there and put on
this image of staying up all night partying.

331
00:28:38,087 --> 00:28:40,601
You can't go out and go crazy every night,

332
00:28:40,647 --> 00:28:43,639
because the performance
for the next show would suffer.

333
00:28:43,687 --> 00:28:45,962
lnstead of spending six hours in the bar,

334
00:28:46,007 --> 00:28:48,441
you can spend six hours on the golf course.

335
00:28:48,487 --> 00:28:51,718
And then maybe an hour in the bar.

336
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:54,156
Not bad, Dave.
A bit hanging on the right side.

337
00:28:54,207 --> 00:28:55,845
That kind of hurt.

338
00:28:55,887 --> 00:28:58,401
Davey is the backbone of the band.

339
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:00,836
You can have a chat about things
and he won't say anything

340
00:29:00,887 --> 00:29:03,640
and then he comes out
with these amazing words of wisdom.

341
00:29:03,687 --> 00:29:05,643
Dave is the wise counsel.

342
00:29:05,687 --> 00:29:08,201
He doesn't say much.
Day-to-day problems?

343
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,078
Not bothered. Major crises?

344
00:29:10,127 --> 00:29:11,799
Somebody will ask Dave what he thinks.

345
00:29:11,847 --> 00:29:14,441
''l think this.'' And it's like ''Whoo!''

346
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:18,480
We should have got that out of him
two hours ago, you know?

347
00:29:18,527 --> 00:29:20,597
- lt's good night from him.
- And it's good night from him.

348
00:29:20,647 --> 00:29:22,444
- And it's...
- Adiós, amigos.

349
00:29:22,487 --> 00:29:25,081
Toodle-oo. Bye-bye, boys and girls.

350
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:27,885
All aboard the Skylark.

351
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:35,235
How many you got to sign there?

352
00:29:35,287 --> 00:29:36,879
This is the second boxload

353
00:29:36,927 --> 00:29:40,886
and there's another four boxloads
in the back that l ain't done yet.

354
00:29:40,927 --> 00:29:43,521
A lot of musicians that tour the world
won't bring their kids,

355
00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:45,762
but you have them with you.

356
00:29:45,807 --> 00:29:47,559
l was the first one
to take my kids on the road

357
00:29:47,607 --> 00:29:51,282
and l think that's been
the hardest part of touring,

358
00:29:51,327 --> 00:29:53,079
being away from your family.

359
00:29:53,127 --> 00:29:54,480
They enjoy being on the road

360
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:58,440
and they still say, ''Dad, when can
we go back and go on the bus again?''

361
00:29:58,487 --> 00:30:00,045
We used to have our own bus.

362
00:30:00,087 --> 00:30:03,284
We were separate from all the mayhem
when we were younger.

363
00:30:03,327 --> 00:30:06,478
l used to like sleeping in the tour bus,
rather than being in hotels.

364
00:30:06,527 --> 00:30:09,200
How would you describe your dad
to other people?

365
00:30:09,247 --> 00:30:10,521
Quiet.

366
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:11,886
Shy.

367
00:30:11,927 --> 00:30:14,566
He keeps himself to himself.
He's quite private.

368
00:30:14,607 --> 00:30:17,724
l think he's kept us really grounded.

369
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:20,201
'Cause we could have been a nightmare.

370
00:30:20,247 --> 00:30:22,442
So is this the last tour you're gonna do?

371
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,636
Yes.

372
00:30:23,687 --> 00:30:24,756
Are you sure?

373
00:30:24,807 --> 00:30:25,842
Positive.

374
00:30:25,887 --> 00:30:27,764
What do you plan to do with your time off?

375
00:30:27,807 --> 00:30:29,718
Grow vegetables.

376
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:34,682
l'll miss two things. Abusing people,
and the sense of humour on the road.

377
00:30:34,727 --> 00:30:36,479
ln the event we land in the water,

378
00:30:36,527 --> 00:30:39,837
remove the jacket from the container,
pull it over your head,

379
00:30:39,887 --> 00:30:41,400
fold the tapes around your waist,

380
00:30:41,447 --> 00:30:45,122
and tie them securely in a double knot
on the left-hand side.

381
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:46,646
l thought it were a single knot.

382
00:30:46,687 --> 00:30:48,723
No, it's a double.

383
00:31:01,607 --> 00:31:05,156
Scream for me, Sydney!

384
00:31:08,527 --> 00:31:10,882
Let me see those hands out there!

385
00:31:10,927 --> 00:31:12,280
Sydney!

386
00:31:12,327 --> 00:31:14,682
Oh, yeah!

387
00:31:14,727 --> 00:31:17,287
Take a look at yourselves.

388
00:31:58,247 --> 00:32:00,636
How you doing? All right, Sydney?

389
00:33:43,407 --> 00:33:46,683
The flying thing was in my bones
from when l was little.

390
00:33:46,727 --> 00:33:48,524
Two members of my family
were in the RAF

391
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:51,127
so l was brought up with aeroplanes.

392
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:55,604
lt shocked me, the experience of getting
in an aeroplane and actually flying.

393
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:57,922
You can never be the master of it.

394
00:33:57,967 --> 00:34:02,358
You can control it to an extent, but
you have to submit to some of its realities.

395
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:05,046
lt's a very humbling experience.

396
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:08,557
Bruce is just full-on.
l mean, the energy of the man.

397
00:34:08,607 --> 00:34:11,519
l wish l had a serum, get some out of him,
stick it into me.

398
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:14,286
He's able to juggle lots of things at once.

399
00:34:14,327 --> 00:34:16,636
He has a perpetual flood of ideas.

400
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,598
His enthusiasm rubs off.

401
00:34:18,647 --> 00:34:23,277
lf he gets excited about something
he really follows it through.

402
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:25,761
Like now, he's flying planes on days off.

403
00:34:25,807 --> 00:34:28,844
We'd be doing a European tour
and we'd fly home after the show

404
00:34:28,887 --> 00:34:30,479
then he'd be flying to North Africa.

405
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:34,998
You think, ''Christ, at his age, he should
slow down a bit.'' But, no, not a bit of it.

406
00:34:35,047 --> 00:34:37,766
Passed our second Equal Time Point.

407
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:43,320
So now we are absolutely
committed to going to Narita.

408
00:34:43,367 --> 00:34:47,645
This is in fact my first time
flying into Japan.

409
00:34:47,687 --> 00:34:50,804
l'd say it's a very wonderful experience
so far.

410
00:35:03,447 --> 00:35:06,439
Take me back to the first time
you played in Japan.

411
00:35:06,487 --> 00:35:08,205
l was excited to come to Japan

412
00:35:08,247 --> 00:35:10,442
because it's somewhere
l'd always wanted to visit.

413
00:35:10,487 --> 00:35:12,523
l was intrigued with all the shogun stuff.

414
00:35:14,247 --> 00:35:17,956
Notice.
l got a Yakuza samurai. Look, see?

415
00:35:20,007 --> 00:35:24,603
Back then you'd turn up in a hotel, they'd
be there and they'd be giving you presents,

416
00:35:24,647 --> 00:35:27,002
little stuffed toys, little cards,

417
00:35:27,047 --> 00:35:29,003
and they'd make you feel really welcome.

418
00:35:29,047 --> 00:35:30,526
lt was the only place in the world

419
00:35:30,567 --> 00:35:34,924
where we physically got mobbed
by teenage girls.

420
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:37,765
Hello. My name is Maria.

421
00:35:37,807 --> 00:35:40,879
Japanese Maiden girl number one!

422
00:35:40,927 --> 00:35:43,964
Welcome to Japan, lron Maiden, OK?

423
00:35:44,007 --> 00:35:47,522
l would like to become
Steve Harris' daughter.

424
00:35:50,687 --> 00:35:52,006
We'll have to work on that.

425
00:35:52,047 --> 00:35:53,400
Stay heavy.

426
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:07,079
lron Maiden's having a massive resurgence.
ls that what's happening in Japan?

427
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:38,842
So focused.

428
00:36:38,887 --> 00:36:40,002
l've never seen anything like it.

429
00:36:40,047 --> 00:36:42,038
l just blocked it out.

430
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:47,282
Get rid of that one.
Pull this back. Pull everything back.

431
00:36:47,327 --> 00:36:49,557
Twenty-six people
to put a black drape in here.

432
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:53,441
Ninety-four people to lay a carpet.
Got to love Japan.

433
00:36:53,487 --> 00:36:56,399
Bring the gear on the stage.

434
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:59,678
Being with lron Maiden, you work
your ass off. There are no days off.

435
00:36:59,727 --> 00:37:02,082
You are on 24/7.

436
00:37:02,127 --> 00:37:05,597
On a good day l start at 7
and l finish at 2am.

437
00:37:05,647 --> 00:37:09,925
The crew are the biggest partiers l know,
but they always come in and do their gig.

438
00:37:09,967 --> 00:37:13,846
When you're in the lron Maiden family,
you're in the lron Maiden family.

439
00:37:13,887 --> 00:37:16,162
You've got to screw up to get kicked out.

440
00:37:16,207 --> 00:37:19,199
ls there any chance we could get a drink
before we finish the set?

441
00:37:19,247 --> 00:37:22,557
- No. You'll wait!
- Just a couple of vodkas.

442
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,120
He's a slave-driver.

443
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:26,761
We need two Laurens
and one support manager.

444
00:37:26,807 --> 00:37:30,197
Wine and food, please.

445
00:37:41,007 --> 00:37:43,840
l'll send the old man back here
to come and get you.

446
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:44,876
The Old Man And The Sea.

447
00:37:44,927 --> 00:37:47,316
His last term.

448
00:37:47,367 --> 00:37:50,757
lt is. lt's his last go.
How many times has he retired?

449
00:37:50,807 --> 00:37:52,843
He'll be back. This is the fourth time.

450
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:54,206
At least twice.

451
00:37:54,247 --> 00:37:57,398
Dick Bell and l go back
way before l joined the band.

452
00:37:57,447 --> 00:38:01,326
He's a phenomenal production manager
and he's part of the family.

453
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:04,643
He used to come round and hit you
on the arm, like ''Come here!''

454
00:38:04,687 --> 00:38:08,077
He's a bit of a bastard.
He knows where to clump you.

455
00:38:08,127 --> 00:38:11,005
And now he's retiring again
after tomorrow.

456
00:38:11,047 --> 00:38:13,197
Let's go.

457
00:38:13,247 --> 00:38:15,283
Not even dressed yet.

458
00:38:21,207 --> 00:38:25,120
OK, Dickie, we're looking at ten minutes.
Are you good?

459
00:38:25,167 --> 00:38:27,203
OK, always good.

460
00:38:30,327 --> 00:38:31,521
We're on.

461
00:40:57,607 --> 00:40:59,518
l know!

462
00:40:59,567 --> 00:41:02,206
That was brilliant. That is so good.

463
00:41:03,207 --> 00:41:05,198
Less of the ''young''.

464
00:41:08,407 --> 00:41:09,840
See you somewhere in Spain.

465
00:41:09,887 --> 00:41:12,401
Everything's done.

466
00:41:14,287 --> 00:41:17,006
lt is a big bastard, isn't it?

467
00:41:20,207 --> 00:41:21,481
Carry on.

468
00:41:21,527 --> 00:41:26,362
lf you are carrying a mobile telephone
or any other electronic equipment

469
00:41:26,407 --> 00:41:29,683
these should be switched off, as these
items may interfere with the air force...

470
00:41:29,727 --> 00:41:31,126
air pressure...

471
00:41:32,927 --> 00:41:35,521
You're shit and you know you are!

472
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:39,322
You're shit and you know you are!

473
00:41:58,447 --> 00:42:03,202
By the time this tour is over,
lron Maiden will have played in 21 cities,

474
00:42:03,247 --> 00:42:06,159
travelled over 50,000 miles in 45 days,

475
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:09,597
something considered nearly impossible
by rock tour standards

476
00:42:09,647 --> 00:42:13,799
until this band figured out a way to pull it off
and created Ed Force One.

477
00:42:13,847 --> 00:42:15,883
Laura lngle, Fox News.

478
00:42:33,807 --> 00:42:36,924
- We made it to sunny LA.
- Yeah, but it is sunny. l mean...

479
00:42:40,487 --> 00:42:43,240
We flew from Japan
after a couple of days there

480
00:42:43,287 --> 00:42:44,959
up through Anchorage to LA.

481
00:42:45,007 --> 00:42:47,521
When we got to LA,
Steve got straight off the plane.

482
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:49,239
To Steve the music comes first.

483
00:42:49,287 --> 00:42:51,926
Off the plane.
Straight down the studio with Kevin.

484
00:42:57,767 --> 00:43:00,486
You might want to leave it up a bit.

485
00:43:00,527 --> 00:43:03,837
Just on that bit.
l'd like to try Jan's guitar, leaving it up.

486
00:43:03,887 --> 00:43:06,606
l don't think Maiden ever cares
about being relevant,

487
00:43:06,647 --> 00:43:09,286
and that's one of the things
that makes them relevant.

488
00:43:09,327 --> 00:43:11,363
We like eight-minute songs.

489
00:43:11,407 --> 00:43:14,956
Slow intros and outros.
The gallop in the middle.

490
00:43:15,007 --> 00:43:18,795
So we've got ten songs like that.
We don't give a fuck.

491
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:23,238
Steve is obviously the anchor of the band.
He writes a lot of the songs.

492
00:43:23,287 --> 00:43:26,563
lf he doesn't write the songs,
he has a say in the way they get arranged.

493
00:43:26,607 --> 00:43:28,120
You know, it's Steve's band.

494
00:43:28,167 --> 00:43:30,158
We have this sixth sense
with one another.

495
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:33,722
He doesn't have to say something.
l can tell what he wants. And likewise.

496
00:43:33,767 --> 00:43:37,680
There are a handful of bass players that
play our sort of music that are that good.

497
00:43:37,727 --> 00:43:41,686
And l'm playing with one
l think is the best in the world.

498
00:43:41,727 --> 00:43:44,639
Steve is the musical basis of Maiden

499
00:43:44,687 --> 00:43:48,077
and it's something l can say,
all the band would agree with that,

500
00:43:48,127 --> 00:43:49,924
that everything gets Steve-ized.

501
00:43:49,967 --> 00:43:54,722
The spirit of Maiden comes from
his musical focus on what he thinks is right,

502
00:43:54,767 --> 00:43:57,406
and he's completely incorruptible.

503
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:11,722
Maiden! Maiden! Maiden!

504
00:44:15,447 --> 00:44:17,756
This way.

505
00:44:17,807 --> 00:44:19,479
My pass sucks.

506
00:44:19,527 --> 00:44:21,518
Your pass is golden.

507
00:44:21,567 --> 00:44:23,558
How did that happen?

508
00:44:23,607 --> 00:44:25,165
He's a big fan.

509
00:44:25,207 --> 00:44:27,767
- All right.
- Thank you, man.

510
00:44:27,807 --> 00:44:31,880
l wore out Piece Of Mind.
l wore that out. l listened to it all day.

511
00:44:31,927 --> 00:44:36,842
At night-time l put the headphones on
and listened to it some more.

512
00:44:36,887 --> 00:44:38,684
Did Smith and Murray
influence your guitar playing?

513
00:44:38,727 --> 00:44:42,003
l was always a fan of the twin axe attack

514
00:44:42,047 --> 00:44:45,357
but, myself, l never wanted to share.

515
00:44:46,927 --> 00:44:51,637
When Steve Harris's foot goes up
on the monitor, and he starts singing along,

516
00:44:51,687 --> 00:44:54,326
l'm gonna be very excited tonight.

517
00:44:54,367 --> 00:44:58,280
l remember one thing
that made quite an impact on me

518
00:44:58,327 --> 00:45:01,364
was on the Number Of The Beast Tour
at Long Beach Arena

519
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,841
we always looked to lron Maiden
for inspiration.

520
00:45:03,887 --> 00:45:08,358
They always had the cooler records,
the cooler album covers,

521
00:45:08,407 --> 00:45:10,523
the cooler stage shows.

522
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:12,637
They just were cooler than everybody else.

523
00:45:12,687 --> 00:45:14,325
ls Nicko an influence on you?

524
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:17,200
Yeah, absolutely.
He's got such a great vibe.

525
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:21,399
One day he's gonna realize
that if he got some smaller drums

526
00:45:21,447 --> 00:45:23,802
you could actually see what he was doing.

527
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:28,398
lt was like ''Nicko, man, come on,
l want to see what the fuck you're doing!''

528
00:45:32,247 --> 00:45:35,000
l have an audience here.

529
00:45:35,047 --> 00:45:37,083
Hiya.

530
00:45:37,127 --> 00:45:39,243
l'm trying to learn something.

531
00:45:40,567 --> 00:45:44,799
Let him who hath understanding
reckon the number of the beast,

532
00:45:44,847 --> 00:45:47,600
for it is a human number.

533
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:51,401
lts number is six hundred and sixty six.

534
00:49:13,047 --> 00:49:16,164
Twenty to eight, so just under six hours.

535
00:49:17,247 --> 00:49:20,000
Still don't quite understand
how l managed to get it all in

536
00:49:20,047 --> 00:49:22,607
but it fits, just about.

537
00:49:31,447 --> 00:49:33,722
Going all the way round the time zones,

538
00:49:33,767 --> 00:49:35,678
halfway round the world, up to Japan,

539
00:49:35,727 --> 00:49:37,479
from summer to winter,

540
00:49:37,527 --> 00:49:40,485
not just across a date line,
backwards a day,

541
00:49:40,527 --> 00:49:41,960
but going back a whole season.

542
00:49:42,007 --> 00:49:45,841
That was a huge chunk of jet lag,
just non-stop.

543
00:49:45,887 --> 00:49:50,039
But when we left LA there was
certainly a slightly sombre mood

544
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:53,841
because there was a feeling that,
''Guys, the holiday bit is over.''

545
00:49:53,887 --> 00:49:58,517
The adventure was really about to begin
because when we hit Latin America,

546
00:49:58,567 --> 00:50:03,561
you get this idea that you're on the edge
of something exploding.

547
00:50:03,607 --> 00:50:07,964
Climb to 5300 and clear direct
to tango tango mike. Five star 666.

548
00:50:08,007 --> 00:50:10,760
- Six six six, the number of the beast.
- You got it.

549
00:50:53,287 --> 00:50:56,802
Welcome home, Monterrey!

550
00:51:00,127 --> 00:51:03,597
lt's great to be in Mexico.

551
00:51:04,047 --> 00:51:06,038
lt is.

552
00:51:06,087 --> 00:51:07,918
And you know what?

553
00:51:07,967 --> 00:51:12,643
Every time we go south of the border,
the hotter it fucking gets.

554
00:51:35,847 --> 00:51:39,806
lron Maiden used to tour in the toughest
areas of Manchester, Liverpool.

555
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:41,439
We're all working-class guys

556
00:51:41,487 --> 00:51:45,241
and we have this kind of a credibility
with the fans, a connection.

557
00:51:45,287 --> 00:51:47,005
Music meant a lot to people.

558
00:51:47,047 --> 00:51:48,924
lt was a way out. lt was a release.

559
00:51:48,967 --> 00:51:52,357
lt's the same in Mexico.
lt's like playing to a soccer crowd.

560
00:51:52,407 --> 00:51:56,241
They're singing, they're chanting
all the words, and it's a real tribal thing.

561
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:59,757
Latin American audiences,
you know they're gonna be great.

562
00:51:59,807 --> 00:52:02,401
The anxiety is, ''Are we gonna be
as good as the audience?''

563
00:52:02,447 --> 00:52:05,041
We're just gonna give 150 per cent.

564
00:52:05,087 --> 00:52:08,238
We've really got to deliver
a passionate performance

565
00:52:08,287 --> 00:52:11,324
that justifies our existence
in front of this audience.

566
00:54:10,967 --> 00:54:12,639
Five quid. That's ten dollars.

567
00:54:14,887 --> 00:54:16,286
All right, eight.

568
00:54:16,327 --> 00:54:18,397
Beautiful.

569
00:54:18,447 --> 00:54:19,516
350 dollars.

570
00:54:19,567 --> 00:54:21,603
- You're joking.
- Look at the work.

571
00:54:21,647 --> 00:54:25,037
lt's very nice.
l've seen work like that before for a fiver.

572
00:54:25,087 --> 00:54:27,806
That is beautiful.
Thank you so much. That's lovely.

573
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,838
Look at that, boys and girls.

574
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:34,915
This is gonna look great on my mantelpiece
at home next to the one l got here last time.

575
00:54:34,967 --> 00:54:36,241
We've lost Janick.

576
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:39,802
As you may have gathered
from what you've seen so far,

577
00:54:39,847 --> 00:54:42,202
Janick's a little bit of a lone soldier.

578
00:54:42,247 --> 00:54:44,681
He runs off and disappears
and does his own thing.

579
00:54:44,727 --> 00:54:47,082
Normally you find him
in an lrish bar somewhere.

580
00:54:47,127 --> 00:54:51,279
As there's no lrish bar here,
he's decided to go off on his own anyway.

581
00:54:51,327 --> 00:54:54,717
Last time we saw him,
he was heading over there.

582
00:54:54,767 --> 00:54:55,756
There he is.

583
00:54:55,807 --> 00:54:56,796
Where?

584
00:54:56,847 --> 00:54:57,836
ln front of us.

585
00:54:57,887 --> 00:55:02,165
He's come back. l was just telling him
you went off on your own.

586
00:55:02,207 --> 00:55:04,675
Yes, there he is. He's back, boys and girls.

587
00:55:04,727 --> 00:55:07,036
Couldn't find the lrish pub
so he came back.

588
00:55:07,087 --> 00:55:11,365
Janick is the jester. He's so funny.
He's a party animal as well.

589
00:55:11,407 --> 00:55:15,559
Out he goes strutting around
and he enjoys his life very much.

590
00:55:15,607 --> 00:55:18,201
Jan is someone
l can bounce a lot of stuff off

591
00:55:18,247 --> 00:55:20,966
and we can talk for hours
about the band, about music.

592
00:55:21,007 --> 00:55:24,238
He won't tell you this,
he's got a degree in sociology.

593
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:25,766
He's a very educated guy.

594
00:55:25,807 --> 00:55:28,844
There's two sides to Janick.
Janick can be quite outgoing.

595
00:55:28,887 --> 00:55:31,799
He loves going to lrish bars
and mixing with people

596
00:55:31,847 --> 00:55:33,997
and other times he'll go out strutting,

597
00:55:34,047 --> 00:55:37,722
like now he'll probably be out
strutting on his own somewhere.

598
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:40,679
He's a free spirit.
He plays guitar like a free spirit.

599
00:55:40,727 --> 00:55:43,002
He never plays the same thing twice.

600
00:55:43,047 --> 00:55:47,518
Sometimes the other guys in the band are
looking over going, ''What are you doing?''

601
00:55:47,567 --> 00:55:49,523
Shall we leave this downstairs?

602
00:55:49,567 --> 00:55:52,445
Wow. Fantastic. Careful, Janick.

603
00:55:53,447 --> 00:55:56,041
We've got to mind our heads here.

604
00:55:56,087 --> 00:56:00,080
We've got to go through
a very low passageway, boys and girls.

605
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:05,242
Shit.

606
00:56:05,287 --> 00:56:08,279
We are under the Sun Pyramid

607
00:56:08,327 --> 00:56:13,765
and we're probably about 50 feet,
60 feet into the Pyramid so far.

608
00:56:14,887 --> 00:56:18,038
- So it's...
- l wondered why it was so dark.

609
00:56:30,727 --> 00:56:34,606
We know that the medicine tradition,
healers,

610
00:56:34,647 --> 00:56:38,720
decide this day
for you to deliver the holy fire

611
00:56:38,767 --> 00:56:41,281
to share it with your brothers
on the holy road,

612
00:56:41,327 --> 00:56:45,957
take all the love to the people that that's
the way how you want to heal the people.

613
00:56:46,007 --> 00:56:48,601
Any message you want to deliver
and share with them?

614
00:56:48,647 --> 00:56:52,799
l share this medicine of the spirits
with my friends,

615
00:56:52,847 --> 00:56:57,045
and wish them health,
happiness, love, friendship,

616
00:56:57,087 --> 00:57:00,363
cherish the spirit and the bond
we have here today.

617
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:44,805
That was fucking insane.

618
00:59:45,647 --> 00:59:48,115
You came in the wrong door.
You've got to go back.

619
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:49,839
l have never seen anything like that.

620
00:59:55,887 --> 01:00:00,039
When the promoter suggested Costa Rica,
l thought, like, 7,000 capacity hall.

621
01:00:00,087 --> 01:00:03,397
He said, ''No, we're doing football stadium.''
l said, ''You sure?''

622
01:00:03,447 --> 01:00:06,803
lt ended up being the biggest gig ever
in Central America.

623
01:00:06,847 --> 01:00:09,202
lt was sold out way upfront, 27,000

624
01:00:09,247 --> 01:00:11,078
and anybody else they could cram in.

625
01:00:11,127 --> 01:00:14,358
lt was the biggest show they'd had
in Costa Rica,

626
01:00:14,407 --> 01:00:15,999
and we'd never been there before.

627
01:00:16,047 --> 01:00:19,881
So it was new territory
for us to go in and Maidenize.

628
01:00:19,927 --> 01:00:23,044
lt was like finding some weird tribe
in the middle of the jungle

629
01:00:23,087 --> 01:00:26,875
and they all come out and go,
''Fear Of The Dark, favourite album!''

630
01:00:26,927 --> 01:00:27,916
''What?''

631
01:00:43,087 --> 01:00:48,161
Children Of The Damned!

632
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:54,199
When l was 1 4 or 15,
l heard lron Maiden for the first time.

633
01:00:54,247 --> 01:00:57,876
''This is amazing. lron Maiden.
Can you imagine to see them live?

634
01:00:57,927 --> 01:01:00,282
''No. Shame we live in the ass of the world.''

635
01:01:00,327 --> 01:01:03,797
A lot of people have come here.
People from El Salvador. Honduras.

636
01:01:03,847 --> 01:01:06,884
Nicaragua.
From South America like Ecuador.

637
01:01:06,927 --> 01:01:08,485
This is once in a lifetime.

638
01:01:08,527 --> 01:01:11,917
l have a friend who quit his job
to be here today.

639
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:14,162
This is the thing, you know.
This is the thing.

640
01:01:21,727 --> 01:01:24,195
Maiden! Maiden!

641
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:27,125
Maiden! Maiden! Maiden!

642
01:01:32,567 --> 01:01:36,162
We decided to go and play golf
in Costa Rica.

643
01:01:36,207 --> 01:01:40,120
So we get out on the first tee,
tee off and get down to the first green.

644
01:01:40,167 --> 01:01:42,601
A fucking golf ball hit me on my wrist.

645
01:01:42,647 --> 01:01:46,276
Within two minutes
it had swollen up, black and blue.

646
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:48,966
My main concern was,
''l'm not gonna be able to play tonight.''

647
01:01:49,647 --> 01:01:51,763
l'm a wounded soldier in battle.

648
01:01:52,967 --> 01:01:55,481
Yeah, it's gonna swell up a bit more.

649
01:01:55,527 --> 01:01:58,917
The doc's saying it'll be a couple of days
it'll go up your arm.

650
01:01:58,967 --> 01:02:01,720
See, boys and girls?
That's what a golf ball can do for you.

651
01:02:01,767 --> 01:02:04,122
Max-Fly number three.
Low compression, though.

652
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:07,000
- lt was a shit ball, thank goodness.
- Dangerous game, isn't it?

653
01:02:07,047 --> 01:02:10,596
- No, not at all.
- You're banned. Are you all right?

654
01:02:10,647 --> 01:02:12,877
Thank the Lord that it wasn't an inch lower.

655
01:02:13,527 --> 01:02:15,961
Because we would have been going home.

656
01:02:16,007 --> 01:02:20,444
lt's ironic that with all the planning and
the huge setup and the massive logistics,

657
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:22,955
the half-an-inch trajectory of a golf ball...

658
01:02:23,007 --> 01:02:25,521
And it would be Nicko, of course.

659
01:02:26,767 --> 01:02:29,520
lt could have brought
the whole thing to an end.

660
01:02:29,567 --> 01:02:31,637
Your face. ''You'd better be able to play.''

661
01:02:31,687 --> 01:02:33,917
You'd better be able to play.

662
01:02:33,967 --> 01:02:35,320
lt'll be fine.

663
01:03:32,007 --> 01:03:34,646
Scream for me, Costa Rica!

664
01:04:45,247 --> 01:04:47,238
Scream for me, Costa Rica!

665
01:04:50,247 --> 01:04:53,603
Scream for me, Costa Rica!

666
01:05:46,087 --> 01:05:50,000
lf it's like this at lmmigration, what's it
going to be like in the rest of the country?

667
01:06:10,327 --> 01:06:12,397
Good afternoon, everybody.
How are you?

668
01:06:12,447 --> 01:06:16,486
The show last night, phenomenal.
Absolutely phenomenal.

669
01:06:16,527 --> 01:06:18,245
As Bruce said when we were in Mexico,

670
01:06:18,287 --> 01:06:22,405
the further south we come down
into South America, the hotter it gets.

671
01:06:22,447 --> 01:06:24,677
And it became pretty hot last night.

672
01:06:24,727 --> 01:06:28,561
The show was really good
and the audience were phenomenal.

673
01:06:28,607 --> 01:06:32,998
So the Columbian audience tomorrow night,
you have something to live up to.

674
01:06:33,047 --> 01:06:35,242
Nicko's a larger-than-life character.

675
01:06:35,287 --> 01:06:38,006
You send him into a room or a party,

676
01:06:38,047 --> 01:06:41,039
he batters his way through
and goes schmoozing in there.

677
01:06:41,087 --> 01:06:43,726
Then l just walk in behind him
and pick up the pieces.

678
01:06:43,767 --> 01:06:47,680
Nicko is the social side of Maiden
because he's so gregarious and fun.

679
01:06:47,727 --> 01:06:51,720
We will go in the room, and sometimes
you've got to say hello to people.

680
01:06:51,767 --> 01:06:54,281
But he's a totally genuine, full-on...

681
01:06:54,327 --> 01:06:56,716
and, again, a great part of the team.

682
01:06:56,767 --> 01:06:58,678
They broke the mould
when they made Nicko.

683
01:06:58,727 --> 01:07:02,481
He's one of these people, the first time
you meet him, you love him for life.

684
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:05,280
What can you say about Nick?
lt's best left unsaid.

685
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:10,115
Yeah, that'll do, won't it?

686
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:29,641
We'd never been to Columbia before

687
01:07:29,687 --> 01:07:32,326
and we were playing this massive park

688
01:07:32,367 --> 01:07:34,927
and all the way along there were tents,
three miles of it.

689
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:38,437
They'd been out for a week, ten days,
so they could get nearer the stage.

690
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:41,001
l've never seen that before, ever.

691
01:07:41,047 --> 01:07:46,599
Seeing that, your pulse rate goes up
and you get a huge adrenaline rush.

692
01:07:59,047 --> 01:08:01,436
Columbia was one of the places

693
01:08:01,487 --> 01:08:04,399
that l was slightly apprehensive
about going to, l guess,

694
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:08,042
because of the idea that
if some kind of event kicked off offstage,

695
01:08:08,087 --> 01:08:10,203
that it could get nasty.

696
01:08:10,247 --> 01:08:12,078
Even though everybody was very happy,

697
01:08:12,127 --> 01:08:15,642
you got the impression
that they lived with the military presence

698
01:08:15,687 --> 01:08:18,155
and tolerated it on a day-to-day basis.

699
01:08:18,207 --> 01:08:21,802
We've been here the whole week
but we don't have any food right now.

700
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:25,476
They just take away everything,
food, cameras, all that stuff.

701
01:08:25,527 --> 01:08:28,041
- So it's pretty heavy security.
- lt's heavy security.

702
01:08:42,807 --> 01:08:46,595
The atmosphere was charged.
lt was all brewing up.

703
01:08:46,647 --> 01:08:51,004
lt was only going to take a small thing
for things to get out of control.

704
01:08:51,047 --> 01:08:53,607
There is no fucking use to it.

705
01:08:53,647 --> 01:08:56,161
They are fucking assholes.

706
01:08:56,207 --> 01:08:59,165
They don't like metal, man.
They are mistreating the metal in here.

707
01:08:59,207 --> 01:09:03,678
The world knows that Columbia
has a very serious social problem.

708
01:09:03,727 --> 01:09:06,400
But here the metal music is alive.

709
01:09:06,447 --> 01:09:10,235
This is the main dream
for every rocker here in Columbia.

710
01:09:10,287 --> 01:09:12,198
l think that l'm going to cry here.

711
01:09:12,247 --> 01:09:15,557
l may sound very emotional
but l think that l'm going to cry there

712
01:09:15,607 --> 01:09:19,202
because l grew up listening to lron Maiden.

713
01:09:33,447 --> 01:09:35,881
Tell you what, the old altitude is...

714
01:09:36,847 --> 01:09:38,166
You feeling it?

715
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:41,643
Big difference.
l woke up this morning in bed,

716
01:09:41,687 --> 01:09:43,643
which is a good place to wake up.

717
01:09:43,687 --> 01:09:45,439
But l was out of breath.

718
01:09:45,487 --> 01:09:49,560
You're just in bed.
lt was shallow breathing and stuff. Bizarre.

719
01:09:49,607 --> 01:09:52,997
Oxygen stage right,
and oxygen by the drummer.

720
01:10:03,607 --> 01:10:05,438
l've got one on my jacket.

721
01:10:05,487 --> 01:10:07,478
No, no, no!

722
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:11,119
Bruce, when you need oxygen,
it's over stage right.

723
01:10:11,167 --> 01:10:14,603
l could have done with oxygen last night.
l've got a shocking hangover.

724
01:12:59,127 --> 01:13:01,083
Come on!

725
01:14:34,007 --> 01:14:35,963
Have a nice bottle of white, mate.

726
01:14:37,247 --> 01:14:41,286
Look at that. Loads of that funny cheese
in there, l bet.

727
01:14:48,087 --> 01:14:49,406
lt's not bad.

728
01:14:49,447 --> 01:14:53,122
l don't like the sweaty-feet cheese
or the strong cheese.

729
01:14:53,167 --> 01:14:55,761
But this ain't bad.
Anyone fancy a chunk of pizza?

730
01:14:55,807 --> 01:14:58,446
No, but nine o'clock is early to leave.

731
01:14:58,487 --> 01:14:59,761
ls that the time we're leaving?

732
01:14:59,807 --> 01:15:01,718
That's a 7:30 wake-up.

733
01:15:01,767 --> 01:15:03,758
Eight o'clock, mate, pack up.

734
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:08,676
You've got to do the three S's. l can do them
in 15 minutes and be downstairs.

735
01:15:08,727 --> 01:15:10,604
l have the shave first, then the shower.

736
01:15:10,647 --> 01:15:14,401
Then the shit. l can't even say it.

737
01:15:14,447 --> 01:15:16,722
Does it confuse you if anything's
out of sequence?

738
01:15:16,767 --> 01:15:17,802
lt does sometimes.

739
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:21,999
Like you wipe your bum with your razor
or something like that?

740
01:15:40,367 --> 01:15:43,837
Please take a seat.
We are cleared for landing.

741
01:15:57,247 --> 01:16:00,637
Brazil, for us, is where Latin America
started, when we did Rock ln Rio.

742
01:16:00,687 --> 01:16:04,726
We went down there just for one show,
and the experience was unbelievable.

743
01:16:04,767 --> 01:16:05,961
Life-changing.

744
01:16:16,407 --> 01:16:19,638
Run To The Hills!

745
01:16:21,487 --> 01:16:23,523
The Rock ln Rio in '85 was fantastic.

746
01:16:23,567 --> 01:16:26,639
We flew in especially for one show,
about 300,000 people,

747
01:16:26,687 --> 01:16:29,679
and it was being televised live
throughout South America.

748
01:16:29,727 --> 01:16:32,082
The whole of South America
suddenly went Maiden.

749
01:16:37,807 --> 01:16:40,560
We came from upstate New York.
lt was freezing cold.

750
01:16:40,607 --> 01:16:43,997
Went down to Rio.
l'd never been to a hot country before.

751
01:16:44,487 --> 01:16:47,524
Certainly not South America.
So it was all wide-eyed.

752
01:16:47,567 --> 01:16:48,761
lt was all a bit of a shock.

753
01:16:48,807 --> 01:16:53,483
Excitable, passionate fans, and people
jumping up and down chanting ''Maiden!''

754
01:16:53,527 --> 01:16:57,725
Being British, we're not used to that.
You don't get that excited.

755
01:16:57,767 --> 01:17:02,363
But the amazing thing is that it goes on
undiminished every time we go back.

756
01:17:07,647 --> 01:17:09,877
You got both signed. Are you happy?

757
01:17:09,927 --> 01:17:12,999
Very happy, man.
Heavy metal. The lrons, man.

758
01:17:13,047 --> 01:17:14,844
lron Maiden is my religion.

759
01:17:14,887 --> 01:17:19,165
ln Brazil, similar to Scandinavia,
it's got the Maiden religion,

760
01:17:19,207 --> 01:17:22,279
because it means so much
to so many people in those areas.

761
01:17:22,327 --> 01:17:24,887
But in some instances
it can get very exaggerated.

762
01:17:24,927 --> 01:17:27,521
There's a priest
an hour and a half out of São Paulo

763
01:17:27,567 --> 01:17:32,004
who does sermons sometimes
around the morality of Maiden lyrics.

764
01:18:18,607 --> 01:18:22,725
Could you describe for us
some of your tattoos?

765
01:22:41,327 --> 01:22:43,682
They are crazy.

766
01:22:43,727 --> 01:22:45,763
With the success of the band
in South America,

767
01:22:45,807 --> 01:22:48,321
you do get the corollary,
the price of fame,

768
01:22:48,367 --> 01:22:52,440
which is that you're really
just stuck inside the hotel.

769
01:22:52,487 --> 01:22:56,321
You can't just go and amble out
and take a stroll.

770
01:22:59,167 --> 01:23:01,840
Argentina was just a bit less subtle.

771
01:23:01,887 --> 01:23:03,684
lt was just 24/7.

772
01:23:06,047 --> 01:23:07,719
The fans do get a bit much sometimes,

773
01:23:07,767 --> 01:23:10,725
when you've been travelling
and people expect you to stop and sign

774
01:23:10,767 --> 01:23:13,361
and have photos and look all cheerful.

775
01:23:13,407 --> 01:23:16,877
Once you're in a hotel,
that's my home away from home.

776
01:23:16,927 --> 01:23:20,806
Outside the hotel, we're fair game.

777
01:25:26,407 --> 01:25:27,840
Argentina!

778
01:27:36,367 --> 01:27:40,679
..Santiago, where the local time
is five to one in the afternoon.

779
01:27:40,727 --> 01:27:43,605
Maiden! Maiden! Maiden!

780
01:28:17,687 --> 01:28:21,521
This was the most out-of-control reception
that we've had in Chile.

781
01:28:21,567 --> 01:28:24,525
lt's ironic that we're in that situation now

782
01:28:24,567 --> 01:28:28,003
because we were banned initially.

783
01:28:33,727 --> 01:28:38,517
The once all-powerful Catholic church
took exception to our ''Satanic'' lyrics

784
01:28:38,567 --> 01:28:41,604
and, unbelievably,
they stopped us coming to Chile.

785
01:28:41,647 --> 01:28:43,797
Maiden!

786
01:29:01,087 --> 01:29:04,523
All they wanted to do was see the band.
That was it. End of story.

787
01:29:04,567 --> 01:29:06,000
They didn't want to start a revolution.

788
01:29:06,047 --> 01:29:09,881
They just wanted to go and see
a heavy metal band.

789
01:29:19,207 --> 01:29:22,244
Scream for me, Santiago!

790
01:30:32,087 --> 01:30:34,726
Santiago, Chile!

791
01:30:37,127 --> 01:30:39,277
l want you.

792
01:30:41,927 --> 01:30:44,395
And l want you!

793
01:30:46,127 --> 01:30:48,083
And you!

794
01:30:48,847 --> 01:30:51,725
And you down here, my friends.

795
01:30:56,367 --> 01:30:58,961
lron Maiden's gonna get you!

796
01:31:01,847 --> 01:31:07,956
lron Maiden's gonna get all of you!

797
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:19,515
This time around, you're playing
essentially a classic lron Maiden set.

798
01:32:19,567 --> 01:32:23,799
lt's like saying to the fans,
at least the fans in America,

799
01:32:23,847 --> 01:32:25,803
''We're gonna revisit the catalogue.''

800
01:32:25,847 --> 01:32:26,836
No.

801
01:32:26,887 --> 01:32:29,003
- Not at all?
- No. Not at all.

802
01:32:29,047 --> 01:32:32,676
We're not some old fossil dragging
the bones of old songs around.

803
01:32:32,727 --> 01:32:36,242
What you'll see tonight
is not just a celebration of old songs.

804
01:32:36,287 --> 01:32:39,006
lt's the celebration
of a lot of young new fans,

805
01:32:39,047 --> 01:32:41,003
who have never seen us
play these songs.

806
01:32:41,047 --> 01:32:44,403
Any time you go out and you play songs
that you've played before,

807
01:32:44,447 --> 01:32:48,725
there's going to be an element of people
going, ''l've heard these songs before.''

808
01:32:48,767 --> 01:32:51,804
But the purpose of this tour
was really very different,

809
01:32:51,847 --> 01:32:54,645
because our entire audience
for the last eight years

810
01:32:54,687 --> 01:32:56,996
has been getting steadily younger.

811
01:32:57,047 --> 01:32:58,605
So, as a big thank you,

812
01:32:58,647 --> 01:33:02,242
large Christmas present
wrapped up in a box with a big bow on top,

813
01:33:02,287 --> 01:33:05,040
here, have a classic
World Slavery Tour.

814
01:33:05,087 --> 01:33:07,555
And that's why l get bent out of shape

815
01:33:07,607 --> 01:33:10,883
any time anybody tries to play
''Pin the tail on the donkey''

816
01:33:10,927 --> 01:33:12,997
and the tail they're trying to pin on us

817
01:33:13,047 --> 01:33:17,199
is that this is some kind
of revival antique show.

818
01:33:17,247 --> 01:33:19,158
And it's not that.

819
01:33:19,207 --> 01:33:22,483
ls there a song or two
that you most look forward to doing again?

820
01:33:22,527 --> 01:33:23,516
Tonight?

821
01:33:23,567 --> 01:33:24,966
ln general.

822
01:33:25,007 --> 01:33:28,044
Tonight or as part of this current
Somewhere Back ln Time tour.

823
01:33:28,087 --> 01:33:29,156
Ancient Mariner.

824
01:33:29,207 --> 01:33:32,722
- ls it really?
- Mariner. Yeah, by far.

825
01:37:05,767 --> 01:37:07,837
Once that plane landed in Toronto,

826
01:37:07,887 --> 01:37:11,880
we knew the show would go ahead,
we'd done it, and that was a great feeling.

827
01:37:11,927 --> 01:37:15,203
And if you look back
over six and a half weeks,

828
01:37:15,247 --> 01:37:17,886
we played 21 cities, 23 shows.

829
01:37:17,927 --> 01:37:22,205
lt's the equivalent of playing
a major concert every alternate day,

830
01:37:22,247 --> 01:37:24,966
except those concerts
are 3,000 kilometres apart.

831
01:37:25,007 --> 01:37:26,963
And we pulled it off.

832
01:37:27,007 --> 01:37:31,683
There was a sense of elation
that, ''Wow, here we are.''

833
01:37:31,727 --> 01:37:34,958
And then l just thought,
''Christ, it's bloody cold.''

834
01:37:37,567 --> 01:37:39,159
Maiden!

835
01:37:40,207 --> 01:37:42,437
Maiden! Maiden!

836
01:37:48,727 --> 01:37:51,161
Definitely in the great white north now.

837
01:37:51,207 --> 01:37:55,325
You see the kids outside queuing up and
they're not wearing much more than l am.

838
01:37:55,367 --> 01:37:56,800
ln the snow.

839
01:37:56,847 --> 01:37:58,724
They're tough up here, man.

840
01:37:58,767 --> 01:38:00,200
Looking forward to going home?

841
01:38:00,247 --> 01:38:02,158
Yes, l am, l must say.

842
01:38:02,967 --> 01:38:06,198
Just having my little bit of space.

843
01:38:06,247 --> 01:38:09,683
One less documentary crew to contend with.

844
01:38:09,727 --> 01:38:13,117
l think you guys
have been pretty cool, really.

845
01:38:13,167 --> 01:38:15,761
l was dreading it, actually.

846
01:38:15,807 --> 01:38:17,923
- So another successful tour?
- Yes.

847
01:38:17,967 --> 01:38:18,956
Quite gruelling.

848
01:38:19,007 --> 01:38:23,046
lt's been amazing. lt's been gruelling.
lt's been one of the hardest.

849
01:38:23,087 --> 01:38:24,122
Yeah.

850
01:38:24,167 --> 01:38:26,397
ln terms of audience...

851
01:38:27,447 --> 01:38:29,358
it's been one of the best.

852
01:38:29,407 --> 01:38:30,476
Yeah.

853
01:38:30,527 --> 01:38:32,165
- How are you, Steve?
- l'm all right.

854
01:38:32,207 --> 01:38:34,641
- Final show.
- Yeah.

855
01:38:34,687 --> 01:38:35,802
We made it.

856
01:38:35,847 --> 01:38:37,963
Finally we made it, yeah.

857
01:38:38,007 --> 01:38:41,522
Feels like we've been out about six months,
doesn't it?

858
01:38:41,567 --> 01:38:45,003
Dear boy, you must be happy
to be home on terra firma.

859
01:38:45,047 --> 01:38:47,561
lndeed l am, thank you.

860
01:38:47,607 --> 01:38:52,044
One more flight tomorrow.
l'll be home in sunny Florida.

861
01:38:52,087 --> 01:38:56,160
And l shall be getting my sticks out
and going to get some lessons.

862
01:38:56,207 --> 01:38:57,799
Have fun!

863
01:38:57,847 --> 01:38:59,599
Thank you!

864
01:38:59,647 --> 01:39:01,603
..fight on the beaches,

865
01:39:01,647 --> 01:39:04,286
we shall fight on the landing grounds,

866
01:39:04,327 --> 01:39:07,603
we shall fight in the fields
and in the streets,

867
01:39:07,647 --> 01:39:11,117
we shall fight in the hills,
we shall never surrender.

868
01:39:11,167 --> 01:39:15,001
l think the essence of us
hasn't changed that much as people.

869
01:39:15,047 --> 01:39:17,641
We do the music
'cause we love doing the music.

870
01:39:17,687 --> 01:39:20,281
lt's not about money.
lt's nice to make money but...

871
01:39:20,327 --> 01:39:23,319
You can see we mean it and we enjoy it.

872
01:39:23,367 --> 01:39:26,086
lt's all about the music
and l think people know that.

873
01:39:26,127 --> 01:39:30,086
We've done it our way.
We do it without radio, without any media.

874
01:39:30,127 --> 01:39:33,881
We haven't become celebrities. We still go
and have a drink in the pub with our mates.

875
01:39:33,927 --> 01:39:36,236
Nobody has to bow down to us.
We're just musicians.

876
01:39:36,287 --> 01:39:39,359
We play music, we enjoy it,
and if you like our music, God bless you.

877
01:39:39,407 --> 01:39:42,717
And if you don't like it, you know what?
God bless you too.

878
01:39:42,767 --> 01:39:45,440
lt's a beautiful thing
that we're still here in 2008,

879
01:39:45,487 --> 01:39:47,762
doing the biggest tour we've ever done.

880
01:39:47,807 --> 01:39:50,002
This is bigger than the '80s.

881
01:39:50,047 --> 01:39:52,436
l'm doing something that l love doing,

882
01:39:52,487 --> 01:39:57,197
being able to play music, travel
round the world, and have a great life,

883
01:39:57,247 --> 01:40:01,923
and that sort of thing you never take
for granted, and enjoy every moment.

884
01:40:01,967 --> 01:40:05,437
We've got a bunch
of your fellow countrymen out with us,

885
01:40:05,487 --> 01:40:07,443
making a documentary

886
01:40:07,487 --> 01:40:11,799
on the madness
that follows us around the world.

887
01:40:11,847 --> 01:40:14,805
So l'm putting them on fair warning now.

888
01:40:14,847 --> 01:40:16,883
They've been well behaved so far.

889
01:40:16,927 --> 01:40:19,236
They've said all the right things.
They've been nice.

890
01:40:19,287 --> 01:40:21,801
We've even bought them drinks.

891
01:40:24,207 --> 01:40:27,279
But you know where they fucking live.
Right?

892
01:40:27,327 --> 01:40:29,283
That's all l'm saying.

893
01:40:29,327 --> 01:40:31,557
lt's fitting that we should end up

894
01:40:31,607 --> 01:40:34,679
with the last bit of the tour
that's been done round the world

895
01:40:34,727 --> 01:40:36,319
in this crazy schedule

896
01:40:36,367 --> 01:40:38,085
in a place that we love,

897
01:40:38,127 --> 01:40:42,279
in a place that embraced lron Maiden
before America ever knew we existed.

898
01:40:43,327 --> 01:40:45,921
Having gone through
the gamut of so many countries,

899
01:40:45,967 --> 01:40:50,563
and generating so much hope in people,

900
01:40:50,607 --> 01:40:53,519
it's starting to occur to me now
that we are actually...

901
01:40:53,567 --> 01:40:57,162
What's that expression?
Being thrust onto the tip of the spear

902
01:40:57,207 --> 01:40:59,846
in terms of putting
some kind of message out there.

903
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:03,038
All people need is something
to hang onto that's real.

904
01:41:03,087 --> 01:41:07,080
Somewhere there's something that you
can rely on and they won't let you down.

905
01:41:07,127 --> 01:41:11,518
And if Maiden fulfil that for people,
l think that would be a remarkable thing.

906
01:41:11,567 --> 01:41:14,843
We might all end up retiring
at some point in the future,

907
01:41:14,887 --> 01:41:17,481
having actually achieved something.

908
01:41:17,527 --> 01:41:19,358
Wow.

909
01:45:31,047 --> 01:45:34,278
Scream for me, Toronto!

910
01:45:34,847 --> 01:45:37,042
Scream for me, Toronto!

911
01:48:47,607 --> 01:48:48,756
Thank you, Toronto!

912
01:48:48,807 --> 01:48:51,719
Thank you, Canada!
We'll see you later, my friends!

913
01:48:52,407 --> 01:48:54,762
See you in the summer!

914
01:51:34,887 --> 01:51:36,605
Give us a kiss!

915
01:51:42,647 --> 01:51:45,923
You just missed the best piece
out of the whole fucking tour.

916
01:51:45,967 --> 01:51:49,676
We need to get Rod Smallwood
in a barrel over there.

917
01:51:49,727 --> 01:51:52,116
lt's bloody nothing, this! l've done worse!

918
01:51:52,167 --> 01:51:54,123
Wankers.

919
01:51:56,327 --> 01:51:58,079
One, two, three.

920
01:52:02,647 --> 01:52:04,444
Tell me to fuck off!

921
01:52:11,527 --> 01:52:14,325
Why don't you lot just fuck off
and go home?
