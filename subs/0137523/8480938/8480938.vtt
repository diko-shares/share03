00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.369
<i>People always ask me</i>
<i>if I know Tyler Durden.</i>

2
00:02:08.636 --> 00:02:10.238
Three minutes.

3
00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:12.674
This is it. Ground zero.

4
00:02:12.807 --> 00:02:16.344
Want to say a few words
for the occasion?

5
00:02:16.477 --> 00:02:19.847
<i>With a gun barrel between your teeth,</i>
<i>you speak only in vowels.</i>

6
00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:21.516
I can't think of anything.

7
00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:25.687
<i>For a second, I forget about</i>
<i>Tyler's controlled demolition thing</i>

8
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.822
<i>and I wonder how clean that gun is.</i>

9
00:02:27.956 --> 00:02:29.958
It's getting exciting now.

10
00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:33.361
<i>That old saying,</i>
<i>how you always hurt the one you love </i>-

11
00:02:33.494 --> 00:02:35.430
<i>well, it works both ways.</i>

12
00:02:35.563 --> 00:02:39.701
<i>We have front-row seats</i>
<i>for this theater of mass destruction.</i>

13
00:02:39.834 --> 00:02:42.337
<i>The Demolitions Committee</i>
<i>of Project Mayhem</i>

14
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.674
<i>wrapped the foundation columns of</i>
<i>a dozen buildings with blasting gelatin.</i>

15
00:02:46.808 --> 00:02:49.611
<i>In two minutes,</i>
<i>primary charges will blow base charges</i>

16
00:02:49.744 --> 00:02:53.681
<i>and a few square blocks will be reduced</i>
<i>to smoldering rubble.</i>

17
00:02:53.815 --> 00:02:56.784
<i>I know this because Tyler knows this.</i>

18
00:02:56.918 --> 00:03:00.355
Two and a half.
Think of everything we've accomplished.

19
00:03:00.488 --> 00:03:05.727
<i>Suddenly I realize that all of this </i>-
<i>the gun, the bombs, the revolution </i>-

20
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.564
<i>has got something to do</i>
<i>with a girl named Marla Singer.</i>

21
00:03:11.432 --> 00:03:13.935
<i>Bob. Bob had bitch tits.</i>

22
00:03:14.268 --> 00:03:18.339
<i>This was a support group</i>
<i>for men with testicular cancer.</i>

23
00:03:18.473 --> 00:03:21.676
<i>The big moosie slobbering all over me,</i>
<i>that was Bob.</i>

24
00:03:22.443 --> 00:03:23.845
We're still men.

25
00:03:23.978 --> 00:03:26.280
Yes, we're men.

26
00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:28.483
Men is what we are.

27
00:03:28.616 --> 00:03:32.854
<i>Bob had had his testicles removed.</i>
<i>Then hormone therapy.</i>

28
00:03:32.987 --> 00:03:35.957
<i>He developed bitch tits</i>
<i>cos his testosterone was too high</i>

29
00:03:36.291 --> 00:03:37.992
<i>and his body upped the estrogen.</i>

30
00:03:38.325 --> 00:03:42.396
- That was where I fit.
- They'll have to drain my pecs again.

31
00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:44.464
<i>Between those huge, sweating tits</i>

32
00:03:44.598 --> 00:03:47.834
<i>that hung enormous,</i>
<i>the way you'd think of God's as big.</i>

33
00:03:47.968 --> 00:03:50.971
OK, you cry now.

34
00:03:51.305 --> 00:03:54.574
<i>No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.</i>

35
00:03:55.008 --> 00:03:57.678
<i>For six months, I couldn't sleep.</i>

36
00:03:57.811 --> 00:04:00.380
<i>I couldn't sleep...</i>

37
00:04:00.514 --> 00:04:02.649
<i>With insomnia, nothing's real.</i>

38
00:04:03.684 --> 00:04:05.552
<i>Everything's far away.</i>

39
00:04:05.686 --> 00:04:07.954
<i>Everything's a copy of a copy</i>

40
00:04:08.088 --> 00:04:10.090
<i>of a copy.</i>

41
00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.931
<i>When deep-space exploration ramps up,</i>
<i>it'll be corporations that name everything.</i>

42
00:04:18.065 --> 00:04:20.434
<i>The IBM Stellar Sphere.</i>

43
00:04:20.567 --> 00:04:22.602
<i>The Microsoft Galaxy.</i>

44
00:04:22.736 --> 00:04:24.738
<i>The Planet Starbucks.</i>

45
00:04:25.405 --> 00:04:28.408
I need you out of town this week
to cover some red flags.

46
00:04:28.542 --> 00:04:31.945
<i>It must have been Tuesday.</i>
<i>He had on his cornflower-blue tie.</i>

47
00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:36.717
You want me to deprioritize my reports
until you advise of a status upgrade?

48
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.455
Prioritize these. Here's your flight
coupons. Call me if there's any snags.

49
00:04:41.588 --> 00:04:45.425
<i>He was full of pep.</i>
<i>Must have had his grande latte enema.</i>

50
00:04:47.594 --> 00:04:52.833
<i>Like so many others, I had become</i>
<i>a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.</i>

51
00:04:52.966 --> 00:04:57.437
- I'd like Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.
- Please hold.

52
00:04:57.571 --> 00:05:03.043
<i>If I saw something clever, a coffee table in</i>
<i>the shape of a yin-yang, I had to have it.</i>

53
00:05:04.077 --> 00:05:06.546
<i>The Klipsk personal office unit.</i>

54
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.082
<i>The Hovetrekke home exerbike.</i>

55
00:05:09.416 --> 00:05:13.086
<i>Or the Ohamshab sofa</i>
<i>with the Strinne green stripe pattern.</i>

56
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.425
<i>Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of</i>
<i>environmentally friendly paper.</i>

57
00:05:18.558 --> 00:05:24.464
<i>I'd flip through catalogs and wonder:</i>
<i>"What kind of dining set defines me?"</i>

58
00:05:24.598 --> 00:05:29.169
<i>I had it all. Even the glass dishes</i>
<i>with tiny bubbles and imperfections,</i>

59
00:05:29.503 --> 00:05:34.508
<i>proof they were crafted by the honest,</i>
<i>hard-working, indigenous peoples of...</i>

60
00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:37.577
- <i>Please hold.</i>
- ..<i>wherever.</i>

61
00:05:37.978 --> 00:05:40.046
<i>We used to read pornography.</i>

62
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.182
<i>Now it was the Horchow collection.</i>

63
00:05:42.516 --> 00:05:47.087
- No. You can't die from insomnia.
- What about narcolepsy?

64
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.057
I nod off, I wake up in strange places.
I have no idea how I got there.

65
00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:55.028
- You need to lighten up.
- Can you please give me something?

66
00:05:55.162 --> 00:05:58.832
<i>Red and blue Tuinals,</i>
<i>lipstick-red Seconals...</i>

67
00:05:58.965 --> 00:06:03.135
No. You need healthy, natural sleep.

68
00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:06.806
Chew some valerian root
and get more exercise.

69
00:06:09.842 --> 00:06:13.579
- Hey, come on. I'm in pain.
- You wanna see pain?

70
00:06:13.712 --> 00:06:18.851
Swing by First Methodist, Tuesdays.
See the guys with testicular cancer.

71
00:06:18.984 --> 00:06:21.020
That's pain.

72
00:06:36.468 --> 00:06:40.472
I always wanted three kids.
Two boys and a girl.

73
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.909
Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.

74
00:06:44.043 --> 00:06:46.779
We never could agree on anything.

75
00:06:47.813 --> 00:06:51.851
Well, she had her first child last week.

76
00:06:51.984 --> 00:06:54.019
A girl.

77
00:06:54.854 --> 00:06:57.223
With her... with her new husband.

78
00:07:01.594 --> 00:07:03.996
And thank God. You know?

79
00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:05.798
I-I'm glad for her.

80
00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:10.970
Because she deserves it.

81
00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:17.142
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.

82
00:07:17.276 --> 00:07:19.712
Thank you, Thomas.

83
00:07:19.845 --> 00:07:22.882
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of courage.

84
00:07:23.015 --> 00:07:25.017
And that gives me strength.

85
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.553
We give each other strength.

86
00:07:27.686 --> 00:07:29.622
It's time for the one-on-ones.

87
00:07:29.755 --> 00:07:34.860
So let's all of us follow Thomas's
example and really open ourselves up.

88
00:07:34.994 --> 00:07:37.563
Could you find a partner?

89
00:07:39.732 --> 00:07:42.301
<i>And this is how I met the big moosie.</i>

90
00:07:43.802 --> 00:07:47.206
<i>His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.</i>

91
00:07:49.141 --> 00:07:52.611
<i>Knees together.</i>
<i>Those awkward little steps.</i>

92
00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.319
- My name is Bob.
- Bob?

93
00:08:00.653 --> 00:08:03.055
<i>Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.</i>

94
00:08:03.188 --> 00:08:06.625
<i>You know that chest expansion</i>
<i>program on late-night TV?</i>

95
00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:08.127
<i>That was his idea.</i>

96
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.696
I was a juicer.

97
00:08:10.829 --> 00:08:13.966
You know - using steroids.

98
00:08:14.099 --> 00:08:18.070
Diabonal and... Wisterol.

99
00:08:18.203 --> 00:08:22.608
Oh, they use that on racehorses,
for Chrissakes.

100
00:08:22.741 --> 00:08:27.012
And now I'm bankrupt, I'm divorced,

101
00:08:28.346 --> 00:08:33.351
my two grown kids
won't even return my phone calls.

102
00:08:34.819 --> 00:08:39.190
<i>Strangers with this kind of honesty</i>
<i>make me go a big, rubbery one.</i>

103
00:08:41.726 --> 00:08:44.329
Go ahead... Cornelius.

104
00:08:44.662 --> 00:08:46.698
You can cry.

105
00:09:01.012 --> 00:09:05.049
<i>And then... something happened.</i>
<i>I let go.</i>

106
00:09:05.183 --> 00:09:06.851
That's really good.

107
00:09:06.985 --> 00:09:08.820
<i>Lost in oblivion.</i>

108
00:09:08.953 --> 00:09:11.923
<i>Dark and silent and complete.</i>

109
00:09:13.791 --> 00:09:15.960
<i>I found freedom.</i>

110
00:09:16.094 --> 00:09:19.364
<i>Losing all hope was freedom.</i>

111
00:09:20.298 --> 00:09:22.367
It's OK.

112
00:09:24.769 --> 00:09:27.238
<i>Babies don't sleep this well.</i>

113
00:09:30.642 --> 00:09:33.111
<i>I became addicted.</i>

114
00:09:46.858 --> 00:09:51.729
<i>If I didn't say anything,</i>
<i>people always assumed the worst.</i>

115
00:09:55.433 --> 00:09:58.670
<i>They cried harder... then I cried harder.</i>

116
00:10:07.712 --> 00:10:12.116
Now we're going to open the green door,
the heart chakra...

117
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.285
<i>I wasn't really dying.</i>

118
00:10:14.419 --> 00:10:18.022
<i>I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.</i>

119
00:10:18.156 --> 00:10:22.026
<i>I was the warm little center that</i>
<i>the life of this world crowded around.</i>

120
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:27.098
Imagine your pain
as a white ball of healing light.

121
00:10:27.231 --> 00:10:31.135
It moves over your body, healing you.

122
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:34.272
Now keep this going.
Remember to breathe.

123
00:10:34.405 --> 00:10:38.242
And step forward
through the back door of the room.

124
00:10:38.376 --> 00:10:40.812
Where does it lead?

125
00:10:40.945 --> 00:10:43.047
To your cave.

126
00:10:43.181 --> 00:10:46.984
Step forward into your cave.

127
00:10:47.118 --> 00:10:49.120
That's right.

128
00:10:49.253 --> 00:10:53.256
<i>You're going deeper into your cave,</i>

129
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:57.761
<i>and you're going to find</i>
<i>your power animal.</i>

130
00:10:59.863 --> 00:11:01.131
Slide.

131
00:11:12.209 --> 00:11:14.277
<i>Every evening I died.</i>

132
00:11:15.412 --> 00:11:18.515
<i>And every evening I was born again.</i>

133
00:11:18.849 --> 00:11:20.884
<i>Resurrected.</i>

134
00:11:22.886 --> 00:11:27.057
<i>Bob loved me because he thought</i>
<i>my testicles were removed too.</i>

135
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:32.095
<i>Being there, pressed against his tits,</i>
<i>ready to cry.</i>

136
00:11:32.229 --> 00:11:34.865
<i>This was my vacation.</i>

137
00:11:38.001 --> 00:11:41.371
<i>And she... ruined everything.</i>

138
00:11:41.505 --> 00:11:43.807
This is cancer, right?

139
00:11:46.543 --> 00:11:51.481
<i>This chick, Marla Singer,</i>
<i>did not have testicular cancer.</i>

140
00:11:51.815 --> 00:11:53.817
<i>She was a liar.</i>

141
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.952
<i>She had no diseases at all.</i>

142
00:11:56.086 --> 00:11:59.856
<i>I had seen her at Free And Clear,</i>
<i>my blood parasites group, Thursdays.</i>

143
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:03.827
<i>Then at Hope,</i>
<i>my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.</i>

144
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.899
<i>And again at Seize The Day,</i>
<i>my tuberculosis, Friday night.</i>

145
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:14.437
<i>Marla, the big tourist.</i>

146
00:12:14.571 --> 00:12:17.140
<i>Her lie reflected my lie.</i>

147
00:12:17.274 --> 00:12:19.943
<i>And suddenly, I felt nothing.</i>

148
00:12:20.076 --> 00:12:25.815
<i>I couldn't cry.</i>
<i>So once again, I couldn't sleep.</i>

149
00:12:36.927 --> 00:12:39.496
<i>Next group, after guided meditation,</i>

150
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:42.866
<i>after we open our heart chakras,</i>
<i>when it's time to hug,</i>

151
00:12:42.999 --> 00:12:45.368
<i>I'll grab that bitch Marla Singer</i>
<i>and scream:</i>

152
00:12:45.502 --> 00:12:49.472
Marla, you liar! You big tourist!
I need this! Now, get out!

153
00:12:51.541 --> 00:12:54.010
<i>I hadn't slept in four days.</i>

154
00:12:54.144 --> 00:12:55.979
<i>We'll just let that dry...</i>

155
00:12:56.112 --> 00:12:59.549
<i>When you have insomnia,</i>
<i>you're never really asleep</i>

156
00:12:59.883 --> 00:13:02.085
<i>and you're never really awake.</i>

157
00:13:04.254 --> 00:13:09.459
To begin tonight's communion,
Chloe would like to say a few words.

158
00:13:09.593 --> 00:13:11.628
<i>Oh, yeah. Chloe.</i>

159
00:13:12.862 --> 00:13:15.632
<i>Chloe looked the way</i>
<i>Meryl Streep's skeleton would look</i>

160
00:13:15.966 --> 00:13:20.002
<i>if you made it walk around a party</i>
<i>being extra nice to everybody.</i>

161
00:13:20.135 --> 00:13:22.371
Well, I'm still here.

162
00:13:22.504 --> 00:13:25.341
But I don't know for how long.

163
00:13:25.474 --> 00:13:29.178
That's as much certainty
as anyone can give me.

164
00:13:29.311 --> 00:13:31.981
But I've got some good news.

165
00:13:32.114 --> 00:13:35.017
I no longer have any fear of death.

166
00:13:38.387 --> 00:13:42.191
But... I am in a pretty lonely place.

167
00:13:43.225 --> 00:13:45.527
No one will have sex with me.

168
00:13:46.428 --> 00:13:51.433
I'm so close to the end, and all I want
is to get laid for the last time.

169
00:13:51.567 --> 00:13:54.970
I have pornographic movies
in my apartment,

170
00:13:55.104 --> 00:13:59.008
- and lubricants and amyl nitrite.
- Thank you, Chloe.

171
00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:01.977
Everyone, let's thank Chloe.

172
00:14:02.111 --> 00:14:04.913
Thank you, Chloe.

173
00:14:06.315 --> 00:14:10.419
Now, let's ready ourself
for guided meditation.

174
00:14:12.254 --> 00:14:15.591
You're standing
at the entrance of your cave.

175
00:14:15.924 --> 00:14:18.961
You step inside your cave
and you walk...

176
00:14:19.094 --> 00:14:23.399
<i>If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.</i>

177
00:14:23.532 --> 00:14:25.167
<i>Marla.</i>

178
00:14:25.301 --> 00:14:27.303
<i>The scratch on the roof of your mouth</i>

179
00:14:27.436 --> 00:14:30.673
<i>that would heal if you could stop</i>
<i>tonguing it, but you can't.</i>

180
00:14:31.006 --> 00:14:35.577
..deeper into your cave as you walk.

181
00:14:35.711 --> 00:14:40.015
<i>You feel</i>
<i>a healing energy all around you.</i>

182
00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:44.086
<i>Now find your power animal.</i>

183
00:14:47.489 --> 00:14:49.058
Slide.

184
00:14:52.962 --> 00:14:55.731
OK. Let's partner up.

185
00:14:56.065 --> 00:14:58.300
Pick someone special to you tonight.

186
00:15:04.473 --> 00:15:06.008
Hey.

187
00:15:07.042 --> 00:15:09.111
- We need to talk.
- Sure.

188
00:15:14.283 --> 00:15:15.985
- I'm onto you.
- What?

189
00:15:16.118 --> 00:15:19.688
Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.

190
00:15:20.022 --> 00:15:21.056
Sorry?

191
00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:25.594
In the Tibetan-philosophy, Sylvia
Plath sense, I know we're all dying.

192
00:15:25.728 --> 00:15:29.331
But you're not dying
the way Chloe back there is dying.

193
00:15:29.465 --> 00:15:31.200
So?

194
00:15:31.333 --> 00:15:33.335
So you're a tourist.

195
00:15:33.469 --> 00:15:37.673
I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,
I saw you at tuberculosis.

196
00:15:38.007 --> 00:15:40.009
I saw you at testicular cancer!

197
00:15:40.142 --> 00:15:42.143
I saw you practicing this.

198
00:15:42.276 --> 00:15:44.212
- Practicing what?
- Telling me off.

199
00:15:44.345 --> 00:15:48.182
Is it going as well as you hoped...
"Rupert"?

200
00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:51.652
- I'll expose you.
- Go ahead. I'll expose you.

201
00:15:51.786 --> 00:15:55.723
Come together. Let yourselves cry.

202
00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:07.301
- Oh, God. Why are you doing this?
- Cheaper than a movie and coffee's free.

203
00:16:07.435 --> 00:16:12.707
Look, this is important. These are my
groups. I've been coming for over a year.

204
00:16:13.041 --> 00:16:16.144
- Why do you do it?
- I don't know.

205
00:16:16.277 --> 00:16:20.148
When people think you're dying,
they really listen to you instead of...

206
00:16:20.281 --> 00:16:23.384
Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.

207
00:16:24.419 --> 00:16:26.821
Yeah. Yeah.

208
00:16:27.622 --> 00:16:30.525
Share yourself, completely.

209
00:16:31.359 --> 00:16:34.429
You don't want to get into this.
It becomes an addiction.

210
00:16:34.562 --> 00:16:36.731
- Really?
- I'm not kidding.

211
00:16:37.065 --> 00:16:40.168
I can't cry if another faker is present,
and I need this.

212
00:16:40.301 --> 00:16:42.737
So you gotta find somewhere else to go.

213
00:16:43.071 --> 00:16:46.507
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.
It's not my problem.

214
00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.312
Wait a second. Hold on.

215
00:16:51.446 --> 00:16:55.516
We'll split up the week, OK?
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.

216
00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:58.586
You take tuberculosis.
My smoking doesn't go over at all.

217
00:16:58.719 --> 00:17:02.256
Good. Fine.
Testicular cancer should be no contest.

218
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:06.160
Technically, I have more right to be
there. You still have your balls.

219
00:17:06.294 --> 00:17:09.130
- You're kidding.
- I dunno. Am I?

220
00:17:09.263 --> 00:17:10.565
No. No.

221
00:17:10.698 --> 00:17:13.334
- What do you want?
- I'll take the parasites.

222
00:17:13.468 --> 00:17:16.237
You can't have both.
Take the blood parasites.

223
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:20.575
- I want brain parasites.
- I'll take blood, I want brain dementia.

224
00:17:20.708 --> 00:17:23.444
- I want that.
- You can't have the whole brain.

225
00:17:23.578 --> 00:17:26.114
So far, you have four. I only have two.

226
00:17:26.247 --> 00:17:30.118
OK. Take both the parasites.
They're yours.

227
00:17:30.251 --> 00:17:32.453
Now we both have three...

228
00:17:36.124 --> 00:17:38.459
Hey! You left half your clothes.

229
00:17:54.375 --> 00:17:58.613
- What, are you selling those?
- Yes, I'm selling some clothes.

230
00:17:58.746 --> 00:18:03.351
We each have three. That's six. What about
the seventh day? I want bowel cancer.

231
00:18:03.484 --> 00:18:05.486
<i>The girl had done her homework.</i>

232
00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:10.757
- No. No. I want bowel cancer.
- That's your favorite too?

233
00:18:10.891 --> 00:18:14.794
- Tried to slip it by me, eh?
- Look, we'll split it.

234
00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:18.198
Take the first and third Sunday
of the month.

235
00:18:20.267 --> 00:18:22.335
Deal.

236
00:18:23.904 --> 00:18:27.641
- Looks like this is goodbye.
- Let's not make a big thing out of it.

237
00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:30.343
How's this for not making a big thing?

238
00:18:34.814 --> 00:18:37.350
Hey, Marla! Marla!

239
00:18:38.885 --> 00:18:42.422
- Maybe we should exchange numbers.
- Should we?

240
00:18:42.556 --> 00:18:44.658
We might wanna switch nights.

241
00:18:45.892 --> 00:18:47.294
OK.

242
00:18:52.699 --> 00:18:54.868
<i>This is how I met Marla Singer.</i>

243
00:18:56.636 --> 00:19:00.440
<i>Marla's philosophy of life</i>
<i>was that she might die at any moment.</i>

244
00:19:00.574 --> 00:19:02.909
<i>The tragedy, she said,</i>
<i>was that she didn't.</i>

245
00:19:03.243 --> 00:19:05.612
It doesn't have your name!
Who are you?

246
00:19:05.745 --> 00:19:11.484
Cornelius? Rupert? Travis? Any of
the stupid names you give each night?

247
00:19:14.721 --> 00:19:17.290
<i>You wake up at SeaTac.</i>

248
00:19:17.424 --> 00:19:19.593
<i>SFO. LAX.</i>

249
00:19:20.727 --> 00:19:26.299
<i>You wake up at O'Hare.</i>
<i>Dallas Fort Worth. BWI.</i>

250
00:19:26.433 --> 00:19:30.003
<i>Pacific. Mountain. Central.</i>
<i>Lose an hour. Gain an hour.</i>

251
00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:33.440
Check-in for that flight
isn't for another two hours.

252
00:19:33.573 --> 00:19:37.477
<i>This is your life,</i>
<i>and it's ending one minute at a time.</i>

253
00:19:37.611 --> 00:19:40.580
<i>You wake up at Air Harbor International.</i>

254
00:19:41.915 --> 00:19:45.752
<i>If you wake up at a different time,</i>
<i>in a different place,</i>

255
00:19:45.885 --> 00:19:48.588
<i>could you wake up as a different person?</i>

256
00:19:49.656 --> 00:19:52.959
<i>Everywhere I travel, tiny life.</i>

257
00:19:53.293 --> 00:19:57.631
<i>Single-serving sugar, single-serving</i>
<i>cream, single pat of butter.</i>

258
00:19:58.331 --> 00:20:00.533
<i>The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.</i>

259
00:20:00.667 --> 00:20:06.539
<i>Shampoo-conditioner combos. Sample</i>
<i>package mouthwash. Tiny bars of soap.</i>

260
00:20:07.907 --> 00:20:12.712
<i>The people I meet on each flight,</i>
<i>they're single-serving friends.</i>

261
00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:18.752
<i>Between takeoff and landing, we have</i>
<i>our time together, but that's all we get.</i>

262
00:20:18.885 --> 00:20:20.787
<i>Welcome!</i>

263
00:20:22.656 --> 00:20:26.960
<i>On a long enough time line, the</i>
<i>survival rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>

264
00:20:27.294 --> 00:20:30.829
<i>I was a recall coordinator.</i>
<i>My job was to apply the formula.</i>

265
00:20:30.963 --> 00:20:34.066
The infant went through the windshield.
Three points.

266
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.437
<i>A new car built by my company</i>
<i>leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.</i>

267
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.639
<i>The rear differential locks up.</i>

268
00:20:40.773 --> 00:20:45.744
The teenager's braces are stuck to the
ashtray. Make a good anti-smoking ad.

269
00:20:45.878 --> 00:20:48.881
<i>The car crashes and burns</i>
<i>with everyone trapped inside.</i>

270
00:20:49.014 --> 00:20:51.717
<i>Now, should we initiate a recall?</i>

271
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:57.089
Father must've been huge. See where the
fat burned to the seat? Polyester shirt?

272
00:20:57.423 --> 00:20:58.924
Very modern art.

273
00:20:59.058 --> 00:21:01.827
<i>Take the number of vehicles</i>
<i>in the field, A.</i>

274
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.663
<i>Multiply it by the probable rate</i>
<i>of failure, B.</i>

275
00:21:04.797 --> 00:21:08.567
<i>Multiply the result by</i>
<i>the average out-of-court settlement, C.</i>

276
00:21:08.701 --> 00:21:10.803
<i>A x B x C...</i>

277
00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:12.438
equals X.

278
00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:17.710
If X is less than the cost of a recall,
we don't do one.

279
00:21:18.544 --> 00:21:22.915
- Are there a lot of these accidents?
- You wouldn't believe.

280
00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:26.952
Which car company do you work for?

281
00:21:28.053 --> 00:21:30.122
A major one.

282
00:21:31.657 --> 00:21:35.561
<i>Every time the plane banked too sharply</i>
<i>on takeoff or landing,</i>

283
00:21:35.694 --> 00:21:39.064
<i>I prayed for a crash</i>
<i>or a midair collision.</i>

284
00:21:39.398 --> 00:21:40.999
<i>Anything.</i>

285
00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:53.746
<i>Life insurance pays off triple</i>
<i>if you die on a business trip.</i>

286
00:21:56.715 --> 00:22:00.753
"If you are seated
in an emergency exit row

287
00:22:00.886 --> 00:22:05.657
and feel unable or unwilling to perform
the duties listed on the safety card,

288
00:22:05.791 --> 00:22:10.062
please ask a flight attendant
to reseat you."

289
00:22:10.396 --> 00:22:14.133
- It's a lot of responsibility.
- Wanna switch seats?

290
00:22:14.466 --> 00:22:17.770
No. I'm not sure
I'm the man for that particular job.

291
00:22:17.903 --> 00:22:22.141
An exit-door procedure at 30,000 feet.
Mm-hm.

292
00:22:22.474 --> 00:22:25.043
The illusion of safety.

293
00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:27.713
Yeah. I guess so.

294
00:22:27.846 --> 00:22:30.549
You know why
they put oxygen masks on planes?

295
00:22:30.682 --> 00:22:34.486
- So you can breathe.
- Oxygen gets you high.

296
00:22:35.587 --> 00:22:38.991
In a catastrophic emergency,
you take giant panic breaths.

297
00:22:39.124 --> 00:22:44.596
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.
You accept your fate.

298
00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.765
It's all right here.

299
00:22:47.533 --> 00:22:49.902
Emergency water landing, 600mph.

300
00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:52.905
Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.

301
00:22:53.772 --> 00:22:56.073
That's, um...

302
00:22:56.207 --> 00:22:58.609
That's an interesting theory.

303
00:23:00.945 --> 00:23:03.481
- What do you do?
- What do you mean?

304
00:23:03.614 --> 00:23:08.052
- What do you do for a living?
- So you can pretend you're interested?

305
00:23:10.788 --> 00:23:12.123
OK.

306
00:23:12.456 --> 00:23:15.126
You have a kind of
sick desperation in your laugh.

307
00:23:18.529 --> 00:23:20.598
We have the exact same briefcase.

308
00:23:22.099 --> 00:23:23.234
Soap.

309
00:23:23.568 --> 00:23:27.071
- Sorry?
- I make and I sell soap.

310
00:23:27.205 --> 00:23:30.007
The yardstick of civilization.

311
00:23:30.141 --> 00:23:32.043
<i>And this is how I met...</i>

312
00:23:32.176 --> 00:23:33.978
"Tyler Durden."

313
00:23:34.111 --> 00:23:39.250
You know if you mix gasoline and frozen
orange juice, you can make napalm?

314
00:23:39.584 --> 00:23:42.486
- No, I did not. Is that true?
- That's right.

315
00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:46.057
One can make all kinds of explosives
using simple household items.

316
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.893
- Really?
- If one were so inclined.

317
00:23:53.865 --> 00:23:58.936
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting
single-serving friend I've ever met.

318
00:24:00.538 --> 00:24:04.909
- Everything on a plane's single-serving.
- Oh, I get it. Very clever.

319
00:24:05.042 --> 00:24:06.677
Thank you.

320
00:24:07.511 --> 00:24:09.614
How's that working out for you?

321
00:24:09.747 --> 00:24:11.716
- What?
- Being clever.

322
00:24:12.783 --> 00:24:17.121
- Great.
- Keep it up, then. Keep it right up.

323
00:24:18.256 --> 00:24:23.661
Now, a question of etiquette. As I pass,
do I give you the ass or the crotch?

324
00:24:30.701 --> 00:24:32.937
<i>How I came to live with Tyler is...</i>

325
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:37.241
<i>Airlines have this policy</i>
<i>about vibrating luggage.</i>

326
00:24:44.949 --> 00:24:46.284
Was it ticking?

327
00:24:46.617 --> 00:24:49.687
Throwers don't worry.
Modern bombs don't tick.

328
00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.924
- Sorry. Throwers?
- Baggage handlers.

329
00:24:53.791 --> 00:24:57.995
But when a suitcase vibrates,
the throwers have to call the police.

330
00:24:58.129 --> 00:25:00.598
My suitcase was vibrating?

331
00:25:00.731 --> 00:25:06.203
Nine times out of ten it's an electric
razor, but... every once in a while...

332
00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.008
it's a dildo.

333
00:25:11.809 --> 00:25:15.846
It's company policy never to imply
ownership in the event of a dildo.

334
00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:21.952
We have to use the indefinite article -
"a dildo", never "your dildo".

335
00:25:22.085 --> 00:25:24.120
I don't own...

336
00:25:26.856 --> 00:25:33.163
<i>I had everything in that suitcase. My</i>
<i>CK shirts. My DKNY shoes. My AX ties.</i>

337
00:25:34.898 --> 00:25:37.167
<i>Never mind.</i>

338
00:25:39.069 --> 00:25:41.838
Hey! That's my car!

339
00:25:48.678 --> 00:25:53.783
<i>Home was on the 15th floor of a filing</i>
<i>cabinet for widows, young professionals.</i>

340
00:25:53.917 --> 00:25:55.919
<i>The walls were solid concrete.</i>

341
00:25:56.052 --> 00:25:59.689
<i>A foot of concrete's important</i>
<i>when your next-door neighbor</i>

342
00:25:59.823 --> 00:26:02.325
<i>has to watch game shows at full volume.</i>

343
00:26:02.659 --> 00:26:06.296
<i>Or when a blast of debris</i>
<i>that used to be your personal effects</i>

344
00:26:06.629 --> 00:26:10.633
<i>blows out of your windows</i>
<i>and sails flaming into the night.</i>

345
00:26:17.007 --> 00:26:19.242
<i>I suppose these things happen.</i>

346
00:26:32.122 --> 00:26:34.157
There's... nothing up there.

347
00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:37.761
You can't go into the unit. Police orders.

348
00:26:46.302 --> 00:26:49.672
Do you have somebody you can call?

349
00:26:49.806 --> 00:26:54.077
<i>How embarrassing.</i>
<i>A houseful of condiments and no food.</i>

350
00:27:04.187 --> 00:27:11.194
<i>Police later told me the pilot light might</i>
<i>have gone out, letting out a bit of gas.</i>

351
00:27:11.327 --> 00:27:16.099
<i>That could have slowly filled the condo</i>
<i>- 1700 square feet with high ceilings </i>-

352
00:27:16.232 --> 00:27:18.101
<i>for days and days.</i>

353
00:27:25.341 --> 00:27:29.179
<i>Then the refrigerator's compressor</i>
<i>could have clicked on.</i>

354
00:27:30.947 --> 00:27:32.315
<i>Yeah?</i>

355
00:27:35.385 --> 00:27:38.154
<i>I can hear you breathing, you...</i>

356
00:27:47.329 --> 00:27:51.200
<i>If you ask me now,</i>
<i>I couldn't tell you why I called him.</i>

357
00:28:33.342 --> 00:28:35.511
- Hello?
- <i>Who's this?</i>

358
00:28:37.479 --> 00:28:39.948
- Tyler?
- <i>Who is this?</i>

359
00:28:40.082 --> 00:28:41.316
Um...

360
00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:43.552
We met... we met on the airplane.

361
00:28:43.886 --> 00:28:46.421
We had the same suitcase?

362
00:28:46.555 --> 00:28:50.526
- Uh... the clever guy.
- <i>Oh, yeah. Right.</i>

363
00:28:52.528 --> 00:28:56.431
I called a second ago. There was
no answer. I'm at a payphone.

364
00:28:56.565 --> 00:28:59.835
<i>Yeah, I *69'd you.</i>
<i>I never pick up my phone.</i>

365
00:29:02.304 --> 00:29:04.373
- <i>So what's up?</i>
- Uh...

366
00:29:05.107 --> 00:29:07.109
Well...

367
00:29:07.242 --> 00:29:09.211
You're not gonna believe this.

368
00:29:11.847 --> 00:29:13.515
It could be worse.

369
00:29:13.849 --> 00:29:18.220
A woman could cut off your penis
while you sleep and toss it out of a car.

370
00:29:18.353 --> 00:29:20.522
There's always that.

371
00:29:20.856 --> 00:29:23.859
It's just, when you buy furniture,
you tell yourself:

372
00:29:23.992 --> 00:29:29.898
"That's the last sofa I'll need. Whatever
happens, I got that sofa problem handled."

373
00:29:30.032 --> 00:29:33.335
I had it all.
I had a stereo that was very decent.

374
00:29:33.468 --> 00:29:36.171
A wardrobe that was getting
very respectable.

375
00:29:36.305 --> 00:29:38.941
I was close to being complete.

376
00:29:39.074 --> 00:29:43.011
- Shit, man. And now it's all gone.
- All gone.

377
00:29:43.145 --> 00:29:44.847
All gone.

378
00:29:46.381 --> 00:29:49.117
Do you know what a duvet is?

379
00:29:49.251 --> 00:29:52.521
- A comforter.
- It's a blanket. Just a blanket.

380
00:29:52.855 --> 00:29:55.090
Why do guys like us know
what a duvet is?

381
00:29:55.224 --> 00:29:59.494
Is this essential to our survival
in the hunter-gatherer sense?

382
00:29:59.628 --> 00:30:01.363
No.

383
00:30:01.496 --> 00:30:05.868
- What are we, then?
- I dunno. Consumers.

384
00:30:06.001 --> 00:30:08.003
Right. We're consumers.

385
00:30:08.136 --> 00:30:11.906
We are by-products of a lifestyle
obsession.

386
00:30:12.039 --> 00:30:15.543
Murder, crime, poverty.
These things don't concern me.

387
00:30:15.877 --> 00:30:18.913
What concerns me are celebrity
magazines,

388
00:30:19.046 --> 00:30:21.048
television with 500 channels,

389
00:30:21.182 --> 00:30:23.184
some guy's name on my underwear.

390
00:30:23.317 --> 00:30:25.987
Rogaine. Viagra. Olestra.

391
00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.923
- Martha Stewart.
- Fuck Martha Stewart.

392
00:30:29.056 --> 00:30:32.393
She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.
It's all going down.

393
00:30:32.526 --> 00:30:37.031
So fuck off with your sofa units
and Strinne green stripe patterns.

394
00:30:37.164 --> 00:30:39.567
I say never be complete.

395
00:30:39.901 --> 00:30:41.669
I say stop being perfect.

396
00:30:42.003 --> 00:30:43.971
I say let's evolve.

397
00:30:44.105 --> 00:30:46.307
Let the chips fall where they may.

398
00:30:48.442 --> 00:30:52.613
But that's me, and I could be wrong.
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.

399
00:30:52.947 --> 00:30:55.283
It's just stuff. It's not a tragedy.

400
00:30:55.416 --> 00:30:59.153
You did lose a lot of versatile solutions
for modern living.

401
00:30:59.287 --> 00:31:02.523
Fuck, you're right.
No, I don't smoke.

402
00:31:05.226 --> 00:31:09.030
My insurance is probably gonna cover it,
so...

403
00:31:12.466 --> 00:31:16.671
- What?
- Things you own end up owning you.

404
00:31:20.141 --> 00:31:22.209
But do what you like, man.

405
00:31:22.977 --> 00:31:25.346
Oh, it's late.

406
00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.050
- Hey, thanks for the beer.
- Yeah, man.

407
00:31:29.183 --> 00:31:31.285
I should find a hotel.

408
00:31:31.419 --> 00:31:33.587
- Oh!
- What?

409
00:31:33.721 --> 00:31:34.956
What?

410
00:31:35.089 --> 00:31:37.058
- A hotel?
- Yeah.

411
00:31:37.191 --> 00:31:40.194
- Just ask, man.
- What are you talking about?

412
00:31:40.328 --> 00:31:44.598
Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer
and you still can't ask.

413
00:31:46.567 --> 00:31:49.370
- What?
- You called cos you need a place to stay.

414
00:31:49.503 --> 00:31:52.974
- Oh, hey. No, no, no.
- Yes, you did. So just ask.

415
00:31:53.107 --> 00:31:55.543
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.

416
00:31:57.378 --> 00:31:59.547
Would... would that be a problem?

417
00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.083
Is it a problem for you to ask?

418
00:32:03.117 --> 00:32:06.387
- Can I stay at your place?
- Yeah.

419
00:32:07.154 --> 00:32:09.223
Thanks.

420
00:32:12.593 --> 00:32:15.563
- I want you to do me a favor.
- Yeah, sure.

421
00:32:15.696 --> 00:32:18.232
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

422
00:32:19.166 --> 00:32:24.438
- What?
- I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

423
00:32:24.572 --> 00:32:27.141
<i>Let me tell you a little</i>
<i>about Tyler Durden.</i>

424
00:32:28.109 --> 00:32:32.046
Tyler was a night person.
While the rest of us slept, he worked.

425
00:32:32.179 --> 00:32:35.248
He had one part-time job
as a projectionist.

426
00:32:35.382 --> 00:32:38.318
A movie doesn't come all on
one big reel. It comes on a few.

427
00:32:38.451 --> 00:32:42.155
So someone has to switch the projectors
at the exact moment

428
00:32:42.288 --> 00:32:44.591
that one reel ends
and the next one begins.

429
00:32:44.724 --> 00:32:49.429
If you look, you can see little dots come
into the upper right corner of the screen.

430
00:32:49.562 --> 00:32:52.465
In the industry,
we call them cigarette burns.

431
00:32:52.599 --> 00:32:54.401
That's the cue for a changeover.

432
00:32:54.534 --> 00:32:59.472
He flips the projectors, movie keeps
going and the audience has no idea.

433
00:32:59.606 --> 00:33:04.778
- Why would anyone want this shit job?
- It affords him interesting opportunities.

434
00:33:05.111 --> 00:33:08.214
Like splicing a frame of pornography
into family films.

435
00:33:08.348 --> 00:33:14.287
When the snooty cat and the courageous
dog with the celebrity voices first meet,

436
00:33:14.421 --> 00:33:17.824
you'll catch a flash
of Tyler's contribution to the film.

437
00:33:24.697 --> 00:33:30.103
- Nobody knows they saw it, they did.
- A nice big cock.

438
00:33:34.741 --> 00:33:37.577
Even a hummingbird
couldn't catch Tyler at work.

439
00:33:42.816 --> 00:33:47.854
Tyler also worked sometimes as a
banquet waiter at the Pressman Hotel.

440
00:33:52.592 --> 00:33:56.596
He was the guerrilla terrorist
of the food service industry.

441
00:33:56.729 --> 00:33:59.099
Do not watch.
I cannot go when you watch.

442
00:33:59.232 --> 00:34:03.770
Apart from seasoning lobster bisque, he
farted on meringues, sneezed on endives...

443
00:34:04.104 --> 00:34:06.206
As for the cream of mushroom soup...

444
00:34:06.339 --> 00:34:10.376
- Go ahead, tell 'em.
- You get the idea.

445
00:34:10.643 --> 00:34:13.713
- You just want me to hit you?
- Come on. Do me this one favor.

446
00:34:13.847 --> 00:34:17.283
- Why?
- Don't know. Never been in a fight. You?

447
00:34:17.417 --> 00:34:21.354
- No. But that's a good thing.
- You can't know yourself if you haven't.

448
00:34:21.488 --> 00:34:23.690
I don't wanna die without any scars.

449
00:34:23.823 --> 00:34:28.261
- Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.
- Oh, God. This is crazy.

450
00:34:28.394 --> 00:34:30.497
So go crazy! Let it rip.

451
00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:33.299
- I don't know about this.
- I don't either.

452
00:34:33.433 --> 00:34:36.436
Who gives a shit? No one's watching.
What do you care?

453
00:34:36.569 --> 00:34:38.872
This is crazy. You want me to hit you?

454
00:34:39.205 --> 00:34:41.207
That's right.

455
00:34:41.341 --> 00:34:44.477
- Where? Like, in the face?
- Surprise me.

456
00:34:46.613 --> 00:34:48.681
This is so fucking stupid.

457
00:34:59.591 --> 00:35:03.829
Motherfucker!
You hit me in the ear!

458
00:35:04.163 --> 00:35:07.266
- Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.
- Ow! Christ!

459
00:35:07.399 --> 00:35:08.767
Why the ear, man?

460
00:35:08.901 --> 00:35:11.236
- I fucked it up.
- No, that was perfect.

461
00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:13.605
Ugh! Agh!

462
00:35:24.183 --> 00:35:26.285
No, it's all right.

463
00:35:26.952 --> 00:35:29.488
It really hurts.

464
00:35:29.621 --> 00:35:31.657
Right.

465
00:35:31.924 --> 00:35:36.461
- Hit me again.
- No, you hit me. Come on!

466
00:35:53.412 --> 00:35:55.814
We should do this again sometime.

467
00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:10.829
- Where's your car?
- What car?

468
00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:25.978
<i>I don't know how Tyler found that house,</i>
<i>but he said he'd been there for a year.</i>

469
00:36:26.311 --> 00:36:28.947
<i>It looked like it was waiting</i>
<i>to be torn down.</i>

470
00:36:29.281 --> 00:36:31.550
<i>Most of the windows were boarded up.</i>

471
00:36:31.683 --> 00:36:36.888
<i>There was no lock on the front door from</i>
<i>when the police, or whoever, kicked it in.</i>

472
00:36:37.022 --> 00:36:39.024
<i>The stairs were ready to collapse.</i>

473
00:36:39.358 --> 00:36:44.429
<i>I didn't know if he owned it or was</i>
<i>squatting. Neither would've surprised me.</i>

474
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:47.366
Yep. That's you.

475
00:36:47.499 --> 00:36:49.901
That's me. That's the toilet. Good?

476
00:36:50.035 --> 00:36:52.738
Yeah, thanks.

477
00:36:52.871 --> 00:36:55.607
<i>What a shithole.</i>

478
00:36:55.741 --> 00:36:57.909
<i>Nothing worked.</i>

479
00:37:00.279 --> 00:37:03.749
<i>Turning on one light meant</i>
<i>another light in the house went out.</i>

480
00:37:03.882 --> 00:37:07.619
<i>There were no neighbors.</i>
<i>Just warehouses and a paper mill.</i>

481
00:37:07.753 --> 00:37:11.723
<i>That fart smell of steam.</i>
<i>The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.</i>

482
00:37:13.525 --> 00:37:15.827
Hey. What have we here?

483
00:37:30.675 --> 00:37:32.777
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

484
00:37:44.588 --> 00:37:47.625
<i>Every time it rained,</i>
<i>we had to kill the power.</i>

485
00:37:47.758 --> 00:37:51.028
<i>By the end of the first month,</i>
<i>I didn't miss TV.</i>

486
00:37:52.063 --> 00:37:55.533
<i>I didn't even mind the warm,</i>
<i>stale refrigerator.</i>

487
00:38:08.679 --> 00:38:11.082
Can I be next?

488
00:38:14.685 --> 00:38:16.454
All right, man.

489
00:38:16.587 --> 00:38:18.622
Lose the tie.

490
00:38:22.793 --> 00:38:26.931
<i>At night, Tyler and I were alone</i>
<i>for half a mile in every direction.</i>

491
00:38:32.503 --> 00:38:36.407
<i>Rain trickled down through</i>
<i>the plaster and the light fixtures.</i>

492
00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:39.143
<i>Everything wooden swelled and shrank.</i>

493
00:38:39.477 --> 00:38:42.580
<i>Everywhere were rusted nails</i>
<i>to snag your elbow on.</i>

494
00:38:42.713 --> 00:38:45.983
<i>The previous occupant</i>
<i>had been a bit of a shut-in.</i>

495
00:38:46.117 --> 00:38:48.519
- What are you reading?
- Listen to this.

496
00:38:48.652 --> 00:38:51.822
It's an article written
by an organ in the first person.

497
00:38:51.956 --> 00:38:53.958
"I am Jack's medulla oblongata."

498
00:38:54.091 --> 00:38:58.863
"Without me, Jack could not regulate his
heart rate, blood pressure or breathing."

499
00:38:58.996 --> 00:39:00.998
There's a whole series of these.

500
00:39:01.132 --> 00:39:05.569
"I Am Jill's Nipples."
"I Am Jack's Colon."

501
00:39:05.703 --> 00:39:08.639
Yeah. "I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack."

502
00:39:09.907 --> 00:39:11.742
Whoop! Agh!

503
00:39:11.876 --> 00:39:15.813
<i>After fighting, everything else in life</i>
<i>got the volume turned down.</i>

504
00:39:15.946 --> 00:39:19.417
What?

505
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:22.953
- <i>You could deal with anything.</i>
- Have you finished those reports?

506
00:39:28.492 --> 00:39:31.028
If you could choose,
who would you fight?

507
00:39:31.162 --> 00:39:32.930
I'd fight my boss, probably.

508
00:39:33.063 --> 00:39:35.065
Really?

509
00:39:35.199 --> 00:39:38.869
- Yeah. Why? Who would you fight?
- I'd fight my dad.

510
00:39:39.003 --> 00:39:40.771
I don't know my dad.

511
00:39:40.905 --> 00:39:44.675
I mean, I know him, but he left
when I was, like, six years old.

512
00:39:44.809 --> 00:39:49.112
Married this other woman and had some
other kids. He did this every six years.

513
00:39:49.446 --> 00:39:54.083
- He moves city and starts a new family.
- Fucker's setting up franchises.

514
00:39:55.718 --> 00:39:59.522
My dad never went to college,
so it was real important that I go.

515
00:39:59.656 --> 00:40:00.990
That sounds familiar.

516
00:40:01.124 --> 00:40:04.961
So I graduate. I call him up long-
distance and say, "Dad, now what?"

517
00:40:05.094 --> 00:40:07.230
- He says, "Get a job."
- Same here.

518
00:40:07.564 --> 00:40:12.101
Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.
"Dad, now what?"

519
00:40:12.235 --> 00:40:14.771
He says, "I dunno. Get married."

520
00:40:16.639 --> 00:40:18.908
You can't get married.

521
00:40:19.042 --> 00:40:21.044
I'm a 30-year-old boy.

522
00:40:21.177 --> 00:40:24.247
We're a generation of men
raised by women.

523
00:40:24.581 --> 00:40:28.818
I'm wondering if another woman
is really the answer we need.

524
00:40:34.023 --> 00:40:37.193
<i>Most of the week,</i>
<i>we were Ozzie and Harriet.</i>

525
00:40:38.661 --> 00:40:42.732
<i>But every Saturday night,</i>
<i>we were finding something out.</i>

526
00:40:42.866 --> 00:40:46.202
<i>We were finding out more and more</i>
<i>that we were not alone.</i>

527
00:40:50.139 --> 00:40:54.844
<i>It used to be when I came home angry</i>
<i>or depressed, I'd just clean my condo,</i>

528
00:40:54.978 --> 00:40:56.980
<i>polish my Scandinavian furniture.</i>

529
00:40:57.113 --> 00:41:02.085
<i>I should've been looking for a new condo,</i>
<i>haggling with my insurance company.</i>

530
00:41:02.218 --> 00:41:07.590
<i>I should have been upset about</i>
<i>my nice flaming little shit - but I wasn't.</i>

531
00:41:07.724 --> 00:41:11.594
The premise of cybernetting an office
is make things more efficient.

532
00:41:11.728 --> 00:41:14.731
<i>Monday mornings,</i>
<i>all I thought about was next week.</i>

533
00:41:14.864 --> 00:41:17.834
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?

534
00:41:17.967 --> 00:41:19.002
Absolutely.

535
00:41:19.135 --> 00:41:22.272
Efficiency is priority No.1, people.

536
00:41:22.605 --> 00:41:25.208
Because waste is a thief.

537
00:41:25.542 --> 00:41:28.578
I showed this to my man here.
You liked it, didn't you?

538
00:41:32.715 --> 00:41:36.886
<i>You can swallow a pint of blood</i>
<i>before you get sick.</i>

539
00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:41.691
<i>It was right in everyone's face.</i>
<i>Tyler and I just made it visible.</i>

540
00:41:41.824 --> 00:41:46.729
<i>It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.</i>
<i>Tyler and I just gave it a name.</i>

541
00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:00.743
Come on, people, you've gotta go home!

542
00:42:21.897 --> 00:42:25.000
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.

543
00:42:46.054 --> 00:42:49.391
<i>Every week, Tyler gave the rules</i>
<i>that he and I decided.</i>

544
00:42:49.725 --> 00:42:51.693
Gentlemen!

545
00:42:51.827 --> 00:42:53.862
Welcome to Fight Club.

546
00:42:55.964 --> 00:43:00.636
The first rule of Fight Club is
you do not talk about Fight Club.

547
00:43:00.769 --> 00:43:03.639
The second rule of Fight Club is...

548
00:43:03.772 --> 00:43:07.075
you do not talk about Fight Club!

549
00:43:07.209 --> 00:43:12.280
Third rule of Fight Club:
someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,

550
00:43:12.414 --> 00:43:14.683
the fight is over.

551
00:43:14.816 --> 00:43:17.686
Fourth rule: only two guys to a fight.

552
00:43:17.819 --> 00:43:22.257
Fifth rule: one fight at a time, fellas.

553
00:43:22.391 --> 00:43:24.926
Sixth rule: no shirts, no shoes.

554
00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:29.865
Seventh rule: fights will go on
as long as they have to.

555
00:43:31.833 --> 00:43:38.840
And the eighth and final rule: if this is
your first night, you have to fight.

556
00:43:43.945 --> 00:43:45.981
<i>This kid from work, Ricky,</i>

557
00:43:46.114 --> 00:43:50.686
<i>couldn't remember whether</i>
<i>you ordered pens with blue ink or black.</i>

558
00:43:51.687 --> 00:43:56.858
<i>Ricky was a god for ten minutes when</i>
<i>he trounced the maitre d' of a food court.</i>

559
00:43:59.261 --> 00:44:04.433
<i>Sometimes, all you could hear were the</i>
<i>flat, hard packing sounds over the yelling.</i>

560
00:44:07.402 --> 00:44:10.706
<i>Or the wet choke</i>
<i>when someone gasped and sprayed...</i>

561
00:44:10.839 --> 00:44:12.708
Stop!

562
00:44:12.841 --> 00:44:15.477
<i>You weren't alive anywhere</i>
<i>like you were there.</i>

563
00:44:15.811 --> 00:44:21.183
<i>But Fight Club only exists in the hours</i>
<i>between when Fight Club starts and ends.</i>

564
00:44:21.316 --> 00:44:26.088
<i>Even if I could tell someone they had a good</i>
<i>fight, I wouldn't be talking to the same man.</i>

565
00:44:26.221 --> 00:44:30.492
<i>Who you were in Fight Club is not</i>
<i>who you were in the rest of the world.</i>

566
00:44:30.826 --> 00:44:34.996
<i>A guy came to Fight Club for the first</i>
<i>time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.</i>

567
00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:37.965
<i>After a few weeks,</i>
<i>he was carved out of wood.</i>

568
00:44:38.833 --> 00:44:41.969
If you could fight any celebrity,
who would you fight?

569
00:44:42.103 --> 00:44:46.006
- Alive or dead?
- Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?

570
00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:49.210
Hemingway. You?

571
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:53.047
Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.

572
00:44:54.982 --> 00:44:58.352
<i>We all started seeing things differently.</i>

573
00:44:58.486 --> 00:45:02.423
<i>Everywhere we went,</i>
<i>we were sizing things up.</i>

574
00:45:05.893 --> 00:45:08.295
<i>I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,</i>

575
00:45:08.429 --> 00:45:12.433
<i>trying to look like how Calvin Klein</i>
<i>or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.</i>

576
00:45:12.766 --> 00:45:15.469
Is that what a man looks like?

577
00:45:15.803 --> 00:45:18.405
Ah, self-improvement is masturbation.

578
00:45:18.539 --> 00:45:20.541
Now, self-destruction...

579
00:45:20.875 --> 00:45:22.843
Excuse me.

580
00:45:57.344 --> 00:46:00.114
<i>Fight Club wasn't about</i>
<i>winning or losing.</i>

581
00:46:00.247 --> 00:46:02.583
<i>It wasn't about words.</i>

582
00:46:04.552 --> 00:46:10.191
<i>The hysterical shouting was in tongues,</i>
<i>like at a Pentecostal church.</i>

583
00:46:14.828 --> 00:46:16.864
- Is that it?
- Stop!

584
00:46:16.997 --> 00:46:19.833
<i>When the fight was over,</i>
<i>nothing was solved.</i>

585
00:46:19.967 --> 00:46:21.835
<i>But nothing mattered.</i>

586
00:46:21.969 --> 00:46:24.004
Cool.

587
00:46:25.573 --> 00:46:28.042
<i>Afterwards, we all felt saved.</i>

588
00:46:28.175 --> 00:46:31.412
Hey, man. How about next week?

589
00:46:31.545 --> 00:46:33.547
How about next month?

590
00:46:33.881 --> 00:46:37.218
Irvine, you're in the middle.
New guy, you too.

591
00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.188
<i>Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.</i>

592
00:46:41.322 --> 00:46:43.924
He fell down some stairs.

593
00:46:44.058 --> 00:46:46.093
I fell down some stairs.

594
00:46:48.262 --> 00:46:52.466
<i>Fight Club became the reason to cut</i>
<i>your hair short or trim your fingernails.</i>

595
00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:55.202
OK. Any historical figure.

596
00:46:55.936 --> 00:46:59.506
- I'd fight Gandhi.
- Good answer.

597
00:47:00.441 --> 00:47:02.642
- How about you?
- Lincoln.

598
00:47:02.976 --> 00:47:04.978
- Lincoln?
- Mm-hm.

599
00:47:05.111 --> 00:47:09.015
Big guy, big reach.
Skinny guys fight till they're burger.

600
00:47:09.148 --> 00:47:11.184
Fuck!

601
00:47:12.385 --> 00:47:16.022
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.

602
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:28.101
- Hello?
- <i>Where've you been the last eight weeks?</i>

603
00:47:28.234 --> 00:47:29.435
<i>Marla?</i>

604
00:47:32.672 --> 00:47:35.541
- How did you find me?
- <i>You left a forwarding number.</i>

605
00:47:35.675 --> 00:47:39.012
I haven't seen you
at any support groups.

606
00:47:39.145 --> 00:47:42.015
<i>We split 'em up.</i>
<i>That was the idea. Remember?</i>

607
00:47:42.148 --> 00:47:44.951
Yeah, but you haven't been
going to yours.

608
00:47:45.084 --> 00:47:48.421
- How do you know?
- I cheated.

609
00:47:48.554 --> 00:47:50.390
I found a new one.

610
00:47:51.024 --> 00:47:53.226
- Really?
- It's for men only.

611
00:47:53.359 --> 00:47:54.961
Like the testicle thing?

612
00:47:55.094 --> 00:47:57.130
Wah!

613
00:47:59.465 --> 00:48:03.236
- Look, this is a bad time.
- I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.

614
00:48:03.369 --> 00:48:06.239
- Some really fucked-up people.
- I'm on my way out.

615
00:48:06.372 --> 00:48:09.309
Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.

616
00:48:09.442 --> 00:48:13.446
I took what was left of a bottle.
It might have been too much.

617
00:48:13.579 --> 00:48:17.517
<i>Picture Marla Singer throwing herself</i>
<i>around her crummy apartment.</i>

618
00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:22.188
This isn't a for-real suicide.
It's probably a cry for help.

619
00:48:22.322 --> 00:48:23.589
<i>This could go on for hours.</i>

620
00:48:23.723 --> 00:48:28.995
- So you're staying in tonight?
- Do you wanna hear me describe death?

621
00:48:29.128 --> 00:48:32.665
<i>Do you wanna listen</i>
<i>and see if my spirit can use a phone?</i>

622
00:48:34.734 --> 00:48:37.603
<i>Have you ever heard</i>
<i>a death rattle before?</i>

623
00:49:03.429 --> 00:49:08.701
<i>Tyler's door was closed. I'd been here for</i>
<i>two months, his door was never closed.</i>

624
00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:20.279
- You won't believe the dream I had last night.
- I hardly believe anything from last night.

625
00:49:30.122 --> 00:49:32.090
What are you doing here?

626
00:49:36.228 --> 00:49:39.364
- What?
- This is my house. What're you doing here?

627
00:49:41.666 --> 00:49:43.668
Fuck you!

628
00:49:58.383 --> 00:50:01.653
Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!

629
00:50:02.654 --> 00:50:05.791
Limber, though. Silly cooze.

630
00:50:07.459 --> 00:50:11.396
I come in last night. Phone's off the
hook. Guess who's on the other end.

631
00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:14.199
<i>I knew the story before he told me.</i>

632
00:50:17.068 --> 00:50:20.071
<i>Have you ever heard</i>
<i>a death rattle before?</i>

633
00:50:20.205 --> 00:50:22.808
Do you think it'll live up to its name?

634
00:50:23.141 --> 00:50:27.112
<i>Or will it just be a death hairball?</i>

635
00:50:30.115 --> 00:50:34.085
<i>Prepare to evacuate soul.</i>

636
00:50:34.219 --> 00:50:38.557
<i>Ten, nine, eight...</i>

637
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:42.260
<i>How could Tyler, of all people,</i>
<i>think it was a bad thing</i>

638
00:50:42.394 --> 00:50:44.796
<i>that Marla Singer was about to die?</i>

639
00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:49.734
..<i>five, four, three...</i>

640
00:50:49.868 --> 00:50:52.103
Hang on.

641
00:50:56.575 --> 00:50:58.844
You got here fast.

642
00:51:01.179 --> 00:51:03.548
Did I call you?

643
00:51:03.682 --> 00:51:05.383
Huh?

644
00:51:13.492 --> 00:51:16.428
The mattress is all sealed
in slippery plastic.

645
00:51:19.598 --> 00:51:22.767
Don't worry. It's not a threat to you.

646
00:51:25.403 --> 00:51:28.807
Oh, fuck! Somebody called the cops.

647
00:51:40.752 --> 00:51:44.356
- Hey, where's 513?
- End of the hall.

648
00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:48.860
The girl who lives there
used to be a charming, lovely girl.

649
00:51:49.194 --> 00:51:51.262
She has lost faith in herself.

650
00:51:51.395 --> 00:51:54.198
- Miss Singer, let us help you!
- She's a monster!

651
00:51:54.331 --> 00:51:58.369
- You have every reason to live.
- She's infectious human waste!

652
00:51:58.502 --> 00:52:02.306
- Miss Singer!
- Good luck trying to save her!

653
00:52:06.944 --> 00:52:11.582
If I fall asleep, I'm done for.

654
00:52:12.883 --> 00:52:15.686
You're gonna have to keep me up...

655
00:52:15.819 --> 00:52:17.821
all night.

656
00:52:17.955 --> 00:52:20.357
Un-fucking-believable.

657
00:52:20.491 --> 00:52:22.560
<i>He was obviously able to handle it.</i>

658
00:52:22.693 --> 00:52:27.197
- You know what I mean. You fucked her.
- No, I didn't.

659
00:52:27.331 --> 00:52:30.301
- Never?
- No.

660
00:52:30.434 --> 00:52:33.704
- You're not into her, are you?
- No! God, not at all.

661
00:52:33.837 --> 00:52:36.473
<i>I am Jack's raging bile duct.</i>

662
00:52:36.607 --> 00:52:40.311
- Are you sure? You can tell me.
- Believe me, I'm sure.

663
00:52:40.444 --> 00:52:43.781
- <i>Put a gun to my head, spray my brains.</i>
- That's good.

664
00:52:43.914 --> 00:52:48.552
She's a predator posing as a house pet.
Stay away from that one.

665
00:52:48.686 --> 00:52:52.356
The shit that came out of
this woman's mouth, I had never heard!

666
00:52:52.489 --> 00:52:53.958
My God.

667
00:52:54.291 --> 00:52:57.528
I haven't been fucked like that
since grade school.

668
00:52:57.661 --> 00:52:59.964
- Eugh!
- How could Tyler not go for that?

669
00:53:00.297 --> 00:53:03.667
<i>The other night, he was</i>
<i>splicing sex organs into "Cinderella".</i>

670
00:53:03.801 --> 00:53:06.570
Marla doesn't need a lover,
just a caseworker.

671
00:53:06.704 --> 00:53:09.340
And a wash.
This isn't love, it's sport fucking.

672
00:53:09.473 --> 00:53:12.843
<i>She invaded my support groups</i>
<i>and now my home.</i>

673
00:53:12.977 --> 00:53:15.012
Hey, hey. Sit down.

674
00:53:19.249 --> 00:53:22.920
- I can't have you talking to her about me.
- Why would I talk to her?

675
00:53:23.253 --> 00:53:29.360
You say anything about me or what goes
on in this house to anybody, we're done.

676
00:53:29.493 --> 00:53:31.261
- Now, promise me.
- OK.

677
00:53:31.395 --> 00:53:32.896
- You promise?
- I promise.

678
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:35.566
- Promise.
- I just said, I promise! What...

679
00:53:35.699 --> 00:53:38.602
That's three times you promised.

680
00:53:39.603 --> 00:53:43.641
<i>If only I had wasted a couple of minutes</i>
<i>and gone to watch Marla Singer die,</i>

681
00:53:43.774 --> 00:53:45.476
<i>none of this would've happened.</i>

682
00:53:50.414 --> 00:53:53.884
Yes! Oh, harder, harder!

683
00:54:00.891 --> 00:54:03.427
<i>I could have moved to another room.</i>

684
00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:07.398
<i>On the third floor</i>
<i>where I might not have heard them.</i>

685
00:54:08.032 --> 00:54:10.300
<i>But I didn't.</i>

686
00:54:29.986 --> 00:54:31.754
Ow!

687
00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:37.794
- What are you doing?
- Just going to bed.

688
00:54:38.795 --> 00:54:41.898
- You wanna finish her off?
- Ooh!

689
00:54:42.832 --> 00:54:46.502
- No. No, thank you.
- I found the cigarettes.

690
00:54:47.503 --> 00:54:49.806
- Who were you talking to?
- Shut up.

691
00:54:49.939 --> 00:54:53.743
<i>I became the calm little center</i>
<i>of the world.</i>

692
00:54:53.876 --> 00:54:55.912
<i>I was the Zen master.</i>

693
00:55:01.017 --> 00:55:03.619
<i>I wrote little haiku poems.</i>

694
00:55:03.753 --> 00:55:06.856
<i>I emailed them to everyone.</i>

695
00:55:06.989 --> 00:55:09.559
Is that your blood?

696
00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:11.928
Some of it, yeah.

697
00:55:12.061 --> 00:55:14.797
You can't smoke in here.

698
00:55:15.965 --> 00:55:19.569
Take the rest of the day off.
Come back Monday with clean clothes.

699
00:55:19.702 --> 00:55:21.537
Get yourself together.

700
00:55:21.671 --> 00:55:26.776
<i>I got right in everyone's hostile face.</i>
"<i>Yes, these are bruises from fighting."</i>

701
00:55:26.909 --> 00:55:31.114
"<i>Yes, I'm comfortable with that.</i>
<i>I am enlightened."</i>

702
00:55:33.049 --> 00:55:37.754
<i>You give up the condo life and</i>
<i>all your flaming worldly possessions,</i>

703
00:55:37.887 --> 00:55:41.491
<i>go live in a dilapidated house</i>
<i>in a toxic-waste part of town,</i>

704
00:55:41.624 --> 00:55:45.495
and you have to come home to this.

705
00:55:56.005 --> 00:56:00.409
- Hello?
- This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.

706
00:56:00.543 --> 00:56:04.447
<i>We have new information about</i>
<i>the incident at your former condo.</i>

707
00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:06.916
- Yes?
- I don't know if you're aware,

708
00:56:07.049 --> 00:56:10.052
but someone sprayed Freon
into your front-door lock.

709
00:56:10.186 --> 00:56:13.422
<i>They used a chisel</i>
<i>to shatter the cylinder.</i>

710
00:56:13.556 --> 00:56:16.993
- No, I wasn't aware of that.
- <i>I am Jack's cold sweat.</i>

711
00:56:17.126 --> 00:56:21.697
- Does this sound strange to you?
- Yes, sir. Very strange.

712
00:56:21.831 --> 00:56:23.466
- The dynamite...
- Dynamite?

713
00:56:23.599 --> 00:56:27.703
..left a residue of ammonium
oxalate potassium perchloride.

714
00:56:27.837 --> 00:56:31.140
- Do you know what this means?
- No. What does it mean?

715
00:56:31.474 --> 00:56:33.209
It means it was home-made.

716
00:56:34.477 --> 00:56:37.613
I'm sorry. This is just coming
as quite a shock to me, sir.

717
00:56:37.747 --> 00:56:43.118
Whoever set this dynamite could've blown
your pilot light days before the explosion.

718
00:56:43.451 --> 00:56:46.454
- The gas was just a detonator.
- Who'd do such a thing?

719
00:56:46.588 --> 00:56:49.090
- <i>I'll ask the questions.</i>
- Tell him.

720
00:56:49.224 --> 00:56:53.028
"The liberator who destroyed my
property realigned my perceptions."

721
00:56:53.161 --> 00:56:58.133
- Excuse me. Are you there?
- Yes. Hard to know what to make of this.

722
00:56:58.466 --> 00:57:02.771
Have you recently made enemies who might
have access to home-made dynamite?

723
00:57:02.904 --> 00:57:05.073
- Enemies?
- "I reject civilization,

724
00:57:05.207 --> 00:57:07.209
especially material possessions."

725
00:57:07.542 --> 00:57:10.178
- <i>Son, this is serious.</i>
- Yes, I know it's serious.

726
00:57:10.512 --> 00:57:12.914
- I mean that.
- Yes, it's very serious.

727
00:57:13.048 --> 00:57:19.554
Look, nobody takes this more seriously
than me. That condo was my life. OK?

728
00:57:19.688 --> 00:57:22.224
I loved every stick of furniture
in that place.

729
00:57:22.557 --> 00:57:25.527
<i>That was not just a bunch of stuff</i>
<i>that got destroyed.</i>

730
00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:27.996
- It was me!
- I thank the Academy.

731
00:57:28.129 --> 00:57:32.601
- <i>Is this not a good time for you?</i>
- Just tell him you fucking did it!

732
00:57:32.734 --> 00:57:36.571
Tell him you blew it all up!
That's what he wants to hear.

733
00:57:36.705 --> 00:57:40.775
- Are you still there?
- Are you saying that I'm a suspect?

734
00:57:40.909 --> 00:57:45.614
No. I may need to talk to you, so you
let me know if you're gonna leave town.

735
00:57:45.747 --> 00:57:48.016
- <i>OK?</i>
- OK.

736
00:57:51.286 --> 00:57:55.257
<i>Except for their humping, Tyler</i>
<i>and Marla were never in the same room.</i>

737
00:57:55.590 --> 00:57:58.593
<i>My parents pulled</i>
<i>this exact same act for years.</i>

738
00:57:58.727 --> 00:58:02.264
The condom is the glass slipper
of our generation.

739
00:58:02.597 --> 00:58:05.267
You slip one on
when you meet a stranger.

740
00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:10.105
You dance all night,
then you throw it away.

741
00:58:10.238 --> 00:58:13.041
The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.

742
00:58:14.075 --> 00:58:15.677
What?

743
00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:23.151
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.

744
00:58:23.285 --> 00:58:25.120
It was worth every penny.

745
00:58:25.253 --> 00:58:27.289
It's a bridesmaid's dress.

746
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:33.295
Someone loved it intensely for one day,

747
00:58:34.329 --> 00:58:35.864
then tossed it.

748
00:58:37.766 --> 00:58:39.801
Like a Christmas tree.

749
00:58:39.935 --> 00:58:42.003
So special.

750
00:58:42.871 --> 00:58:45.307
Then... bam!

751
00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:48.009
It's on the side of the road.

752
00:58:48.143 --> 00:58:50.745
Tinsel still clinging to it.

753
00:58:52.247 --> 00:58:59.254
Like a sex-crime victim, underwear
inside out, bound with electrical tape.

754
00:58:59.788 --> 00:59:02.257
Well, then, it suits you.

755
00:59:02.591 --> 00:59:04.858
You can borrow it sometime.

756
00:59:11.765 --> 00:59:13.934
Get rid of her.

757
00:59:14.068 --> 00:59:16.704
- What? You get rid of her!
- Don't mention me.

758
00:59:16.837 --> 00:59:20.941
<i>I am six years old again,</i>
<i>passing messages between parents.</i>

759
00:59:24.044 --> 00:59:26.981
- It's time you left.
- Don't worry, I'm leaving.

760
00:59:27.114 --> 00:59:32.019
- Not that we don't love your visits.
- You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.

761
00:59:36.323 --> 00:59:37.758
Thanks. Bye.

762
00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:55.643
You kids!

763
00:59:55.776 --> 00:59:58.679
Why do you still waste time with her?

764
00:59:59.713 --> 01:00:03.250
I'll say this about Marla.
At least she's trying to hit bottom.

765
01:00:03.384 --> 01:00:04.785
And I'm not?

766
01:00:04.918 --> 01:00:08.422
Sticking feathers up your butt
does not make you a chicken.

767
01:00:08.756 --> 01:00:10.324
What are we doing tonight?

768
01:00:10.658 --> 01:00:13.694
Tonight... we make soap.

769
01:00:13.827 --> 01:00:17.798
- Really?
- To make soap, first we render fat.

770
01:00:37.117 --> 01:00:42.690
The salt balance has to be just right, the
best fat for soap comes from humans.

771
01:00:42.823 --> 01:00:46.427
- Wait. What is this place?
- A liposuction clinic.

772
01:00:53.967 --> 01:00:55.969
Aha! Pay dirt!

773
01:00:56.103 --> 01:01:00.974
Richest, creamiest fat in the world.
The fat of the land!

774
01:01:06.013 --> 01:01:09.083
No! Don't pull it.

775
01:01:13.754 --> 01:01:16.323
- Oh, God!
- I'll get another one.

776
01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:27.768
As the fat renders, the tallows float
to the surface. Like in Boy Scouts.

777
01:01:27.901 --> 01:01:31.504
- It's hard to imagine you a Boy Scout.
- Keep stirring.

778
01:01:33.973 --> 01:01:37.376
Once the tallow hardens,
you skim off a layer of glycerin.

779
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:39.979
Add nitric acid, you got nitroglycerin.

780
01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:44.917
If you then add sodium nitrate
and sawdust, you got dynamite.

781
01:01:45.051 --> 01:01:47.854
With enough soap,
one could blow up anything.

782
01:01:47.987 --> 01:01:49.989
<i>Tyler was full of useful information.</i>

783
01:01:50.123 --> 01:01:54.393
Ancient peoples found clothes got cleaner
when washed in one part of the river.

784
01:01:54.527 --> 01:01:56.129
- You know why?
- No.

785
01:01:59.966 --> 01:02:02.835
Humans were once sacrificed
on the hills above.

786
01:02:02.969 --> 01:02:07.039
Bodies burnt, water seeped
through the ashes to create lye.

787
01:02:07.173 --> 01:02:09.108
This is lye. The crucial ingredient.

788
01:02:09.242 --> 01:02:13.379
Once it mixed with the melted body fat,
a soapy discharge crept into the river.

789
01:02:13.513 --> 01:02:15.548
May I see your hand, please?

790
01:02:23.055 --> 01:02:24.223
What is this?

791
01:02:24.357 --> 01:02:26.959
- This is a chemical burn.
- Agh! Aaagh!

792
01:02:27.093 --> 01:02:30.429
It'll hurt more than you've ever
been burned and leave a scar.

793
01:02:30.563 --> 01:02:34.000
<i>If meditation worked for cancer,</i>
<i>it could work for this.</i>

794
01:02:34.133 --> 01:02:36.903
- Don't shut the pain out.
- Oh, God!

795
01:02:37.537 --> 01:02:42.074
The first soap was made from heroes' ashes,
like the first monkey shot into space.

796
01:02:42.208 --> 01:02:45.144
Without pain or sacrifice,
we would have nothing.

797
01:02:45.278 --> 01:02:48.147
<i>I tried not to think</i>
<i>of the words "searing" or "flesh".</i>

798
01:02:48.281 --> 01:02:51.350
Stop it! This is your pain,
this is your burning hand.

799
01:02:51.484 --> 01:02:54.420
I'm going to my cave
to find my power animal.

800
01:02:54.554 --> 01:02:58.257
No! Don't deal with this
the way those dead people do! Come on!

801
01:02:58.391 --> 01:03:02.361
- I get the point!
- No! You're feeling premature enlightenment.

802
01:03:05.965 --> 01:03:09.235
It's the greatest moment of your life,
and you're missing it!

803
01:03:09.368 --> 01:03:10.903
I am not...

804
01:03:11.037 --> 01:03:13.973
Shut up! Our fathers
were our models for God.

805
01:03:14.106 --> 01:03:18.144
If our fathers bailed,
what does that tell you about God?

806
01:03:18.845 --> 01:03:24.016
Listen to me. You have to consider the
possibility that God does not like you.

807
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:27.520
He never wanted you.
In all probability, he hates you.

808
01:03:27.854 --> 01:03:31.257
This is not the worst thing
that can happen. We don't need him!

809
01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:34.293
- I agree!
- Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.

810
01:03:34.427 --> 01:03:36.963
We are God's unwanted children?
So be it!

811
01:03:37.096 --> 01:03:41.100
- I'm getting water!
- You can use water and make it worse or...

812
01:03:41.234 --> 01:03:42.468
Look at me!

813
01:03:42.602 --> 01:03:46.172
- ..or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.
- Please let me up!

814
01:03:46.305 --> 01:03:48.307
First, you have to give up.

815
01:03:48.441 --> 01:03:51.143
First, you have to know - not fear -

816
01:03:51.277 --> 01:03:54.212
know that someday, you're gonna die.

817
01:03:54.346 --> 01:03:56.481
You don't know how this feels!

818
01:04:01.386 --> 01:04:06.591
It's only after we've lost everything
that we're free to do anything.

819
01:04:06.925 --> 01:04:08.960
OK.

820
01:04:22.974 --> 01:04:27.212
Congratulations.
You're one step closer to hitting bottom.

821
01:04:29.681 --> 01:04:35.020
<i>Tyler sold his soap to department stores at</i>
<i>$20 a bar. God knows what they charged.</i>

822
01:04:35.153 --> 01:04:39.124
- This is the best soap.
- Why, thank you, Susan.

823
01:04:39.257 --> 01:04:40.692
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

824
01:04:41.026 --> 01:04:44.696
<i>We were selling rich women</i>
<i>their own fat asses back to them.</i>

825
01:04:46.197 --> 01:04:47.933
<i>He was wearing his yellow tie.</i>

826
01:04:48.066 --> 01:04:50.468
<i>I didn't even wear a tie to work anymore.</i>

827
01:04:50.602 --> 01:04:54.005
"The first rule of Fight Club
is don't talk about Fight Club"?

828
01:04:54.139 --> 01:04:57.509
<i>I'm half-asleep again.</i>
<i>I must have left it in the copy machine.</i>

829
01:04:57.642 --> 01:05:00.645
"The second rule..." Is this yours?

830
01:05:00.979 --> 01:05:02.013
Huh?

831
01:05:02.147 --> 01:05:05.517
Pretend you're me.
Make a managerial decision.

832
01:05:05.650 --> 01:05:08.186
You find this. What would you do?

833
01:05:12.691 --> 01:05:14.659
Well, I gotta tell you,

834
01:05:14.993 --> 01:05:18.363
I'd be very, very careful
who you talk to about that.

835
01:05:18.496 --> 01:05:21.967
Because the person who wrote that
is dangerous.

836
01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:26.438
And this button-down, Oxford-cloth
psycho might just snap

837
01:05:26.571 --> 01:05:29.407
and then stalk from office to office

838
01:05:29.541 --> 01:05:34.512
with an Armalite AR10 carbine
gas-powered semiautomatic weapon,

839
01:05:34.646 --> 01:05:39.617
pumping round after round
into colleagues and co-workers.

840
01:05:39.751 --> 01:05:43.188
This might be someone
you've known for years.

841
01:05:43.321 --> 01:05:47.225
Someone very, very close to you.

842
01:05:47.359 --> 01:05:49.761
<i>Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.</i>

843
01:05:51.329 --> 01:05:53.365
<i>And I used to be such a nice guy.</i>

844
01:05:53.498 --> 01:05:57.102
Or maybe you shouldn't bring me
every piece of trash you pick up.

845
01:06:00.472 --> 01:06:03.775
- Compliance and Liability.
- My tit's gonna rot off.

846
01:06:05.643 --> 01:06:08.413
Will you excuse me? I need to take this.

847
01:06:14.119 --> 01:06:18.089
- What do you mean?
- I need you to check for a lump in my breast.

848
01:06:18.223 --> 01:06:22.593
- Go to a hospital.
- I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.

849
01:06:22.726 --> 01:06:25.095
I don't know about this, Marla.

850
01:06:25.229 --> 01:06:26.296
Please?

851
01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:30.401
<i>She didn't call Tyler.</i>
<i>I'm neutral in her book.</i>

852
01:06:32.436 --> 01:06:36.440
That's nice. Taking food
to Mrs... Haniver and Mrs. Raines.

853
01:06:36.573 --> 01:06:38.575
Where are they, exactly?

854
01:06:38.709 --> 01:06:42.746
Tragically, they're dead.
I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?

855
01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.082
- No, no.
- I got one for you.

856
01:06:45.215 --> 01:06:47.251
Thanks for the thought.

857
01:06:48.552 --> 01:06:50.754
What happened to your hand?

858
01:06:51.088 --> 01:06:53.190
Oh, nothing.

859
01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:56.260
- Right there?
- Mm.

860
01:06:56.393 --> 01:06:59.063
- Feel anything?
- No.

861
01:06:59.196 --> 01:07:01.832
Well, make sure.

862
01:07:02.166 --> 01:07:05.402
- OK, I'm pretty sure.
- You feel nothing?

863
01:07:06.336 --> 01:07:08.405
No, nothing.

864
01:07:09.406 --> 01:07:12.509
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.

865
01:07:13.644 --> 01:07:16.780
- No problem.
- I wish I could return the favor.

866
01:07:17.114 --> 01:07:19.116
Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.

867
01:07:19.249 --> 01:07:22.586
- I could check your prostate.
- I think I'm OK.

868
01:07:22.719 --> 01:07:24.755
Well, thanks, anyway.

869
01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:32.262
- Are we done?
- Yeah, we're done.

870
01:07:32.396 --> 01:07:34.465
See you... around.

871
01:07:51.615 --> 01:07:53.650
Cornelius?

872
01:07:53.784 --> 01:07:56.220
Cornelius!

873
01:07:56.353 --> 01:07:58.856
It's me! Bob!

874
01:07:59.189 --> 01:08:00.524
Hey, Bob.

875
01:08:04.361 --> 01:08:07.464
- We all thought you were dead.
- No, no. Still here.

876
01:08:07.598 --> 01:08:11.235
- How are you, Bob?
- Better than I've been in my whole life.

877
01:08:11.368 --> 01:08:16.540
- Really? Still Remaining Men Together?
- No. I got something much better now.

878
01:08:16.673 --> 01:08:19.243
Really? What is it?

879
01:08:19.376 --> 01:08:21.211
Well...

880
01:08:21.345 --> 01:08:26.150
The first rule is,
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

881
01:08:26.283 --> 01:08:27.651
And the second rule is...

882
01:08:27.784 --> 01:08:29.586
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

883
01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:33.657
- And the third rule is...
- Bob, Bob. I'm a member.

884
01:08:34.391 --> 01:08:36.460
Look at my face, Bob.

885
01:08:38.295 --> 01:08:40.531
That's fucking great.

886
01:08:40.664 --> 01:08:44.367
- I've never seen you there.
- I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.

887
01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:47.770
- I go Saturday.
- Congratulations.

888
01:08:48.771 --> 01:08:50.806
Yeah. Hey, to both of us, right?

889
01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:53.609
Have you heard about the guy
that invented it?

890
01:08:53.743 --> 01:08:56.612
- Yeah, actually...
- I hear all kinds of things.

891
01:08:56.746 --> 01:09:00.816
Supposedly,
he was born in a mental institution

892
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:04.587
and he sleeps only one hour a night.

893
01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:07.790
- He's a great man.
- Oh...

894
01:09:07.924 --> 01:09:10.660
Do you know about Tyler Durden?

895
01:09:34.850 --> 01:09:37.420
I didn't hurt you, did I?

896
01:09:37.553 --> 01:09:39.855
Actually, you did.

897
01:09:39.989 --> 01:09:43.626
Thank you for this.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

898
01:09:43.759 --> 01:09:45.995
<i>Fight Club.</i>

899
01:09:46.329 --> 01:09:48.364
<i>This was mine and Tyler's gift.</i>

900
01:09:48.631 --> 01:09:50.666
<i>Our gift to the world.</i>

901
01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.869
I look around, I look around,
I see a lot of new faces.

902
01:09:55.571 --> 01:09:57.740
Shut up!

903
01:09:58.808 --> 01:10:04.280
Which means a lot of people have been
breaking the first rules of Fight Club.

904
01:10:10.953 --> 01:10:15.625
I see in Fight Club the strongest
and smartest men who've ever lived.

905
01:10:15.758 --> 01:10:20.463
I see all this potential.
And I see it squandered.

906
01:10:21.297 --> 01:10:24.433
Goddammit,
an entire generation pumping gas,

907
01:10:24.567 --> 01:10:26.269
or waiting tables.

908
01:10:26.402 --> 01:10:28.671
Slaves with white collars.

909
01:10:30.806 --> 01:10:33.843
Advertising has us chasing cars
and clothes,

910
01:10:33.976 --> 01:10:38.514
working jobs we hate
so we can buy shit we don't need.

911
01:10:41.284 --> 01:10:45.988
We're the middle children of history,
men. No purpose or place.

912
01:10:46.322 --> 01:10:48.357
We have no Great War,

913
01:10:48.491 --> 01:10:50.526
no Great Depression.

914
01:10:52.328 --> 01:10:54.864
Our great war is a spiritual war.

915
01:10:54.997 --> 01:10:57.967
Our great depression is our lives.

916
01:11:02.071 --> 01:11:05.841
We've all been raised on TV to believe
that one day we'd be millionaires

917
01:11:05.975 --> 01:11:07.976
and movie gods and rock stars.

918
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:10.312
But we won't.

919
01:11:10.445 --> 01:11:13.048
We're slowly learning that fact.

920
01:11:13.381 --> 01:11:16.051
And we're very, very pissed off.

921
01:11:16.384 --> 01:11:18.420
Yeah!

922
01:11:20.889 --> 01:11:24.492
First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...

923
01:11:29.864 --> 01:11:31.866
Who are you?

924
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.669
- Who am I?
- Yeah.

925
01:11:35.937 --> 01:11:39.407
There's a sign on the front
that says Lou's Tavern.

926
01:11:39.541 --> 01:11:43.445
I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?

927
01:11:43.978 --> 01:11:45.547
Tyler Durden.

928
01:11:48.650 --> 01:11:51.653
Who told you motherfuckers
you could use my place?

929
01:11:51.786 --> 01:11:54.556
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

930
01:11:54.689 --> 01:11:59.828
Irvine's at home with a broken
collarbone. He don't own this place. I do.

931
01:12:02.130 --> 01:12:04.999
- How much money does he get?
- There is no money.

932
01:12:05.133 --> 01:12:06.935
- Really?
- Free to all.

933
01:12:07.068 --> 01:12:09.838
- Ain't that something.
- It is, actually.

934
01:12:09.971 --> 01:12:12.474
Look, stupid fuck!

935
01:12:12.607 --> 01:12:18.480
- I want everybody out of here right now.
- Hey! You should join our club.

936
01:12:18.613 --> 01:12:21.916
- Did you hear what I just said?
- You and your friend.

937
01:12:23.852 --> 01:12:26.921
You hear me now?

938
01:12:28.089 --> 01:12:30.158
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.

939
01:12:36.765 --> 01:12:38.466
Still not getting it.

940
01:12:39.834 --> 01:12:41.603
Agh! OK, OK, I got it.

941
01:12:41.736 --> 01:12:44.072
I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.

942
01:12:45.807 --> 01:12:47.976
Back! All of you!

943
01:12:48.777 --> 01:12:50.845
Everybody back!

944
01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:00.522
Ah, Lou!

945
01:13:00.655 --> 01:13:04.159
Come on, man!
We really like this place.

946
01:13:13.968 --> 01:13:17.172
- That's right, Lou. Get it out.
- Shut the fuck up.

947
01:13:17.505 --> 01:13:20.775
Oh, yeah!

948
01:13:23.044 --> 01:13:25.113
Is that fucking funny?

949
01:13:34.054 --> 01:13:37.458
Fucking guy's a loony, I'm telling you.

950
01:13:38.125 --> 01:13:39.893
Unbelievable.

951
01:13:44.064 --> 01:13:47.000
- You don't know where I've been, Lou.
- Oh, my God!

952
01:13:47.134 --> 01:13:50.003
You don't know where I've been!

953
01:13:53.073 --> 01:13:56.109
Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!

954
01:13:56.243 --> 01:14:01.715
- Fucking use the basement! Christ!
- I want your word! I want your word!

955
01:14:01.849 --> 01:14:03.817
On my mother's eyes.

956
01:14:12.926 --> 01:14:14.995
Thanks, Lou.

957
01:14:16.263 --> 01:14:18.532
You too, big guy.

958
01:14:22.503 --> 01:14:24.571
We'll see you next week.

959
01:14:39.987 --> 01:14:44.858
This week, each one of you
has a homework assignment.

960
01:14:44.992 --> 01:14:49.563
You're gonna go out. You're gonna
start a fight with a total stranger.

961
01:14:51.798 --> 01:14:54.601
You're gonna start a fight,

962
01:14:54.735 --> 01:14:56.837
and you're gonna lose.

963
01:14:58.972 --> 01:15:00.874
Excellent choice, sir.

964
01:15:02.676 --> 01:15:05.746
Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!

965
01:15:05.879 --> 01:15:08.949
<i>Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.</i>

966
01:15:11.718 --> 01:15:13.654
What... Son of a bitch!

967
01:15:13.787 --> 01:15:18.859
<i>Most people - normal people </i>-
<i>do just about anything to avoid a fight.</i>

968
01:15:19.893 --> 01:15:21.328
Excuse me!

969
01:15:21.662 --> 01:15:23.664
You sprayed me with your hose.

970
01:15:23.797 --> 01:15:25.165
That's not necessary.

971
01:15:25.299 --> 01:15:27.200
Jay! Go call 911!

972
01:15:30.003 --> 01:15:32.005
Put the hose down.

973
01:15:32.139 --> 01:15:34.174
Stop it! Stop it!

974
01:15:36.777 --> 01:15:37.811
Sorry.

975
01:15:45.152 --> 01:15:47.588
You bastard!

976
01:15:53.226 --> 01:15:55.796
We need to talk.

977
01:15:57.597 --> 01:15:59.665
OK.

978
01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:02.168
Where to begin?

979
01:16:02.301 --> 01:16:04.971
With your constant absenteeism?

980
01:16:05.104 --> 01:16:07.907
With your unpresentable appearance?

981
01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:12.645
- You're up for review.
- I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.

982
01:16:12.778 --> 01:16:14.647
- What?
- Let's pretend.

983
01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:18.184
You're the Department
of Transportation, OK?

984
01:16:18.317 --> 01:16:23.289
Someone informs you that this company
installs front-seat mounting brackets

985
01:16:23.623 --> 01:16:25.358
that never pass collision tests,

986
01:16:25.691 --> 01:16:28.961
brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,

987
01:16:29.095 --> 01:16:34.200
and fuel injectors
that explode and burn people alive.

988
01:16:34.333 --> 01:16:36.168
What then?

989
01:16:36.302 --> 01:16:38.838
- Are you threatening me?
- No...

990
01:16:38.971 --> 01:16:42.375
- Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!
- I have a better solution.

991
01:16:42.708 --> 01:16:45.978
Keep me on the payroll
as an outside consultant

992
01:16:46.112 --> 01:16:52.318
in exchange for my salary, my job will be
never to tell people things that I know.

993
01:16:52.652 --> 01:16:57.089
I don't even have to come into the office.
I can do this job from home.

994
01:16:57.223 --> 01:17:02.194
Who... who the fuck do you think
you are, you crazy little shit?

995
01:17:06.298 --> 01:17:09.935
- Security!
- <i>I am Jack's smirking revenge.</i>

996
01:17:16.676 --> 01:17:18.044
Agh!

997
01:17:19.211 --> 01:17:21.013
What the hell are you doing?

998
01:17:30.156 --> 01:17:32.792
That hurt.

999
01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:36.262
Why would you do that?

1000
01:17:36.395 --> 01:17:39.365
Oh, my God! No! Please stop!

1001
01:17:49.909 --> 01:17:51.944
What are you doing?

1002
01:17:52.078 --> 01:17:54.080
Oh, God, no! Please! No!

1003
01:17:54.213 --> 01:17:58.217
<i>For some reason,</i>
<i>I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.</i>

1004
01:17:58.350 --> 01:18:00.019
No!

1005
01:18:24.309 --> 01:18:28.880
<i>Under and behind and inside</i>
<i>everything this man took for granted,</i>

1006
01:18:29.013 --> 01:18:32.317
<i>something horrible had been growing.</i>

1007
01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:38.289
Look. Just give me the paychecks, like I
asked, and you won't ever see me again.

1008
01:18:38.423 --> 01:18:43.228
<i>And right then,</i>
<i>at our most excellent moment together...</i>

1009
01:18:44.262 --> 01:18:48.066
Thank God!
Please don't hit me again.

1010
01:18:48.199 --> 01:18:54.873
<i>Telephone, computer, fax, 52 weekly</i>
<i>paychecks and 48 airline flight coupons.</i>

1011
01:18:55.006 --> 01:18:57.308
<i>We now had corporate sponsorship.</i>

1012
01:18:57.442 --> 01:19:02.213
<i>This is how Tyler and I were able to have</i>
<i>Fight Club every night of the week.</i>

1013
01:19:04.048 --> 01:19:08.419
<i>Now, nobody was the center of Fight</i>
<i>Club except the two men fighting.</i>

1014
01:19:09.154 --> 01:19:13.792
<i>The leader walked through the crowd,</i>
<i>out in the darkness.</i>

1015
01:19:13.925 --> 01:19:17.529
<i>Tyler was now involved in a lawsuit</i>
<i>with the Pressman Hotel</i>

1016
01:19:17.862 --> 01:19:20.799
<i>over the urine content of their soup.</i>

1017
01:19:25.937 --> 01:19:28.940
<i>I am Jack's wasted life.</i>

1018
01:19:36.514 --> 01:19:38.583
Thank you, sir.

1019
01:19:40.185 --> 01:19:43.154
<i>Tyler dreamed up</i>
<i>new homework assignments.</i>

1020
01:19:43.288 --> 01:19:45.890
<i>He handed them out in sealed envelopes.</i>

1021
01:20:25.463 --> 01:20:28.566
- There's a Fight Club in Delaware City.
- Yeah, I heard.

1022
01:20:30.401 --> 01:20:35.006
There's one in Penns Grove, too.
Bob even found one up in New Castle.

1023
01:20:35.139 --> 01:20:38.142
- Did you start that one?
- No, I thought you did.

1024
01:20:38.276 --> 01:20:40.645
No.

1025
01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.662
- Stop.
- What are we doing?

1026
01:21:31.995 --> 01:21:33.964
- Turn around.
- What are we doing?

1027
01:21:34.097 --> 01:21:36.366
- Homework assignment.
- What kind?

1028
01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:38.468
Human sacrifice.

1029
01:21:38.602 --> 01:21:43.540
- Is that a gun? Please tell me it's not.
- It's a gun. Meet me in the back.

1030
01:21:43.674 --> 01:21:46.710
- Don't fuck around!
- Meet me in the back.

1031
01:21:47.044 --> 01:21:51.615
<i>On a long enough time line, the survival</i>
<i>rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>

1032
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:56.687
- Stop. What are you doing?
- Hands behind your back.

1033
01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:58.522
Give me your wallet.

1034
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:05.529
Raymond K Hessel. 1320 SE Banning,
Apartment A. Cramped basement apartment?

1035
01:22:05.662 --> 01:22:10.067
- How did you know?
- They give shitty apartments letters.

1036
01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:13.236
Raymond! You're going to die.

1037
01:22:13.370 --> 01:22:14.671
No!

1038
01:22:15.005 --> 01:22:19.076
Is that your mom and dad? They're
gonna have to call the kindly doctor.

1039
01:22:19.209 --> 01:22:21.345
Pick up your dental records. Know why?

1040
01:22:21.478 --> 01:22:25.082
- There'll be nothing left of your face.
- Come on!

1041
01:22:25.215 --> 01:22:29.619
An expired community college student
ID. What did you study, Raymond?

1042
01:22:29.753 --> 01:22:32.189
- S-Stuff.
- Stuff?

1043
01:22:32.322 --> 01:22:34.358
Were the midterms hard?

1044
01:22:35.459 --> 01:22:38.395
- I asked you what you studied!
- Biology, mostly.

1045
01:22:38.528 --> 01:22:41.598
- Why?
- I don't know.

1046
01:22:41.732 --> 01:22:44.668
What did you wanna be,
Raymond K Hessel?

1047
01:22:46.203 --> 01:22:51.041
The question, Raymond, was:
what did you want to be?

1048
01:22:52.309 --> 01:22:53.744
Answer him, Raymond! Jesus!

1049
01:22:54.077 --> 01:22:56.346
- Veterinarian. Veterinarian.
- Animals.

1050
01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:59.383
- Yeah. Animals and stuff.
- Stuff. Yeah, I got that.

1051
01:22:59.516 --> 01:23:02.119
- So you need more schooling.
- Too much school.

1052
01:23:02.252 --> 01:23:04.554
- Would you rather be dead?
- No, please...

1053
01:23:04.688 --> 01:23:09.192
You'd rather die here, on your knees,
in the back of a convenience store?

1054
01:23:09.326 --> 01:23:12.261
No. Please, no.

1055
01:23:15.498 --> 01:23:18.234
I'm keeping your license.

1056
01:23:18.367 --> 01:23:22.138
Gonna check in on you.
I know where you live.

1057
01:23:22.271 --> 01:23:26.542
If you're not on your way to being a
veterinarian in six weeks, you will be dead.

1058
01:23:29.178 --> 01:23:31.447
Now, run on home.

1059
01:23:35.384 --> 01:23:37.386
Run, Forrest, run!

1060
01:23:39.088 --> 01:23:41.157
I feel ill.

1061
01:23:42.525 --> 01:23:46.495
- Imagine how he feels.
- Come on, this isn't funny!

1062
01:23:46.629 --> 01:23:49.131
What the fuck was the point of that?

1063
01:23:49.265 --> 01:23:52.735
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day
of Raymond K Hessel's life.

1064
01:23:53.069 --> 01:23:57.339
His breakfast will taste better than
any meal you and I have ever tasted.

1065
01:23:58.674 --> 01:24:00.709
<i>You had to give it to him.</i>

1066
01:24:00.843 --> 01:24:03.279
- Come on.
- <i>He had a plan.</i>

1067
01:24:03.412 --> 01:24:06.682
<i>And it started to make sense</i>
<i>in a Tyler sort of way.</i>

1068
01:24:06.816 --> 01:24:09.785
<i>No fear. No distractions.</i>

1069
01:24:10.119 --> 01:24:14.323
<i>The ability to let that which</i>
<i>does not matter truly slide.</i>

1070
01:24:27.636 --> 01:24:29.738
<i>You are not your job.</i>

1071
01:24:31.674 --> 01:24:35.177
You're not how much money
you have in the bank.

1072
01:24:36.745 --> 01:24:39.348
You're not the car you drive.

1073
01:24:39.482 --> 01:24:43.185
You're not the contents of your wallet.

1074
01:24:43.319 --> 01:24:45.688
You're not your fucking khakis.

1075
01:24:47.490 --> 01:24:51.627
You are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1076
01:24:59.869 --> 01:25:02.304
I'll be out of your way in a sec.

1077
01:25:03.139 --> 01:25:05.207
You don't have to go.

1078
01:25:06.609 --> 01:25:08.677
Whatever.

1079
01:25:09.478 --> 01:25:12.848
No, I mean... It's OK.

1080
01:25:22.491 --> 01:25:25.227
Are you still going to groups?

1081
01:25:25.361 --> 01:25:27.396
Yeah.

1082
01:25:28.764 --> 01:25:30.799
Chloe's dead.

1083
01:25:30.933 --> 01:25:33.802
Wow. Chloe.

1084
01:25:33.936 --> 01:25:36.271
When did that happen?

1085
01:25:36.404 --> 01:25:38.640
Do you care?

1086
01:25:38.773 --> 01:25:41.442
I dunno. I haven't thought about it
in a while.

1087
01:25:41.576 --> 01:25:43.778
Yeah, well...

1088
01:25:43.912 --> 01:25:46.948
It was the smart move on her part.

1089
01:25:48.816 --> 01:25:50.919
Listen, um...

1090
01:25:51.252 --> 01:25:53.688
What are you getting out of all this?

1091
01:25:53.821 --> 01:25:55.823
What?

1092
01:25:55.957 --> 01:25:58.927
I mean, all this. Why do you keep...?

1093
01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:01.296
Is this making you happy?

1094
01:26:02.764 --> 01:26:04.832
Yeah, well, sometimes.

1095
01:26:06.601 --> 01:26:08.670
I don't know. I don't understand.

1096
01:26:08.803 --> 01:26:14.542
Why does a weaker person need to latch
on to a strong person? What is that?

1097
01:26:14.676 --> 01:26:16.778
What do you get out of it?

1098
01:26:18.746 --> 01:26:23.751
No... That's not the same thing at all.
It's totally different with us.

1099
01:26:23.885 --> 01:26:25.587
"Us"?

1100
01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:29.457
- What do you mean by "us"?
- I'm sorry. Do you hear this?

1101
01:26:29.591 --> 01:26:32.227
- Hear what?
- All that noise. Hold on.

1102
01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:35.597
No, wait! Don't change the subject!
I want to talk about this.

1103
01:26:35.730 --> 01:26:38.499
- You're not talking about me, are you?
- No.

1104
01:26:38.633 --> 01:26:41.936
- What?
- You playing doctor. What was going on?

1105
01:26:42.270 --> 01:26:45.406
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1106
01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:47.542
- I don't think so.
- What do you want?

1107
01:26:47.675 --> 01:26:49.978
- Look at me.
- No. What?

1108
01:26:51.479 --> 01:26:54.382
- What is that?
- It's nothing. Don't worry.

1109
01:26:54.515 --> 01:26:57.352
- My God. Who did this?
- A person.

1110
01:26:57.485 --> 01:26:58.653
Guy or girl?

1111
01:26:58.786 --> 01:27:01.322
- What do you care?
- What do you care if I ask?

1112
01:27:01.456 --> 01:27:03.458
- Leave me alone.
- You're afraid to say.

1113
01:27:03.591 --> 01:27:05.860
- I am not. Let me go.
- No! Talk to me.

1114
01:27:05.994 --> 01:27:07.629
Let go of me. Leave me alone!

1115
01:27:07.762 --> 01:27:09.897
- This conversation...
- This conversation...

1116
01:27:10.031 --> 01:27:12.600
- ..is over.
- ..is over.

1117
01:27:14.502 --> 01:27:17.272
I just can't win with you, can I?

1118
01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:29.651
Hey, this is getting a little old!

1119
01:27:29.784 --> 01:27:31.653
What is... what is all this?

1120
01:27:31.786 --> 01:27:34.422
What do you think?

1121
01:27:34.856 --> 01:27:37.058
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?

1122
01:27:37.392 --> 01:27:38.426
Hey!

1123
01:27:45.867 --> 01:27:48.836
Too young. Sorry.

1124
01:27:49.737 --> 01:27:51.472
What's all that?

1125
01:27:51.606 --> 01:27:54.876
Tell the applicant
if he's too young, too old or too fat.

1126
01:27:55.009 --> 01:27:56.344
Applicant?

1127
01:27:56.477 --> 01:28:02.416
If the applicant waits three days without food
or shelter, he may enter and begin training.

1128
01:28:02.549 --> 01:28:04.418
Training for what?

1129
01:28:09.856 --> 01:28:14.428
You think this is a game? You're
too young to train here, end of story.

1130
01:28:14.561 --> 01:28:17.898
Quit wasting our time.
Get the fuck out of here.

1131
01:28:21.535 --> 01:28:23.870
Bad news, friend.

1132
01:28:24.004 --> 01:28:26.707
It's not gonna happen.

1133
01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:28.975
Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.

1134
01:28:29.109 --> 01:28:32.612
It's not the end of the world.
Just... go away.

1135
01:28:33.814 --> 01:28:35.515
Go.

1136
01:28:35.649 --> 01:28:40.020
You're trespassing
and I will have to call the police.

1137
01:28:43.423 --> 01:28:47.728
Don't you look at me! You're
never getting in this fucking house!

1138
01:28:47.861 --> 01:28:51.098
Never. Now get the fuck off my porch!
Get off my porch!

1139
01:28:51.431 --> 01:28:54.468
<i>Sooner or later, we all became</i>
<i>what Tyler wanted us to be.</i>

1140
01:28:54.601 --> 01:28:57.771
I'm gonna go inside
and I'm gonna get a shovel.

1141
01:29:05.412 --> 01:29:09.483
Got two black shirts?
Two pair of black pants?

1142
01:29:09.616 --> 01:29:12.419
- Yes, sir.
- One pair black boots? Black socks?

1143
01:29:12.552 --> 01:29:13.987
- Sir.
- One black jacket?

1144
01:29:14.121 --> 01:29:16.456
- Sir.
- $300 personal burial money?

1145
01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:18.091
Yes, sir.

1146
01:29:20.427 --> 01:29:22.496
All right.

1147
01:29:32.506 --> 01:29:34.574
You're too old, fat man.

1148
01:29:35.542 --> 01:29:38.812
Your tits are too big.
Get the fuck off my porch.

1149
01:29:45.952 --> 01:29:48.021
Bob! Bob!

1150
01:30:03.503 --> 01:30:06.039
Like a monkey
ready to be shot into space.

1151
01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:08.475
Space monkey.

1152
01:30:09.176 --> 01:30:12.712
Ready to sacrifice himself
for the greater good.

1153
01:30:18.118 --> 01:30:21.488
You are too fucking old, fatty!

1154
01:30:21.621 --> 01:30:26.125
And you... You're too fucking blond!

1155
01:30:26.458 --> 01:30:28.727
Get out of here, the both of you!

1156
01:30:29.094 --> 01:30:30.696
<i>And so it went.</i>

1157
01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:33.032
Listen up, maggots.

1158
01:30:33.165 --> 01:30:35.568
You are not special.

1159
01:30:35.701 --> 01:30:39.538
You are not a beautiful
or unique snowflake.

1160
01:30:39.672 --> 01:30:43.242
You are the same decaying organic
matter as everything else.

1161
01:30:43.576 --> 01:30:45.711
<i>Tyler built himself an army.</i>

1162
01:30:45.845 --> 01:30:49.915
<i>We are the all-singing,</i>
<i>all-dancing crap of the world.</i>

1163
01:30:50.049 --> 01:30:53.652
<i>We are all part of the same</i>
<i>compost heap.</i>

1164
01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:58.557
<i>Why was Tyler Durden building an army?</i>

1165
01:30:58.691 --> 01:31:02.094
<i>To what purpose?</i>
<i>For what greater good?</i>

1166
01:31:05.564 --> 01:31:07.633
<i>In Tyler we trusted.</i>

1167
01:31:10.970 --> 01:31:17.977
No, no, no, no. When he was, like, "You
are not your job," I was, like, "Yeah!"

1168
01:31:20.546 --> 01:31:23.883
- Hey, what's all this?
- Hey!

1169
01:31:25.284 --> 01:31:27.086
OK!

1170
01:31:27.219 --> 01:31:29.555
- What's going on?
- We're celebrating.

1171
01:31:29.688 --> 01:31:32.057
- What are we celebrating?
- Go on.

1172
01:31:36.128 --> 01:31:38.197
- Hey.
- Let me get that for you.

1173
01:31:42.868 --> 01:31:46.772
<i>Same great taste.</i>
<i>Pepsi. Generation Next.</i>

1174
01:31:47.573 --> 01:31:49.909
Shh!

1175
01:31:50.042 --> 01:31:54.780
<i>Investigators are on the scene.</i>
<i>The police commissioner has arrived.</i>

1176
01:31:54.914 --> 01:31:58.117
<i>Could you tell us</i>
<i>what you think has happened here?</i>

1177
01:31:58.250 --> 01:32:02.054
<i>We believe this is one of many</i>
<i>recent acts of vandalism around the city</i>

1178
01:32:02.187 --> 01:32:05.991
<i>somehow related to</i>
<i>underground boxing clubs.</i>

1179
01:32:06.125 --> 01:32:09.929
<i>We will be coordinating</i>
<i>a rigorous investigation.</i>

1180
01:32:10.062 --> 01:32:13.332
<i>That was Commissioner Jacobs</i>
<i>who just arrived on the scene</i>

1181
01:32:13.666 --> 01:32:18.771
- of a four-alarm fire that broke out...
- She's hot.

1182
01:32:18.904 --> 01:32:20.739
<i>Back to you in the studio.</i>

1183
01:32:21.707 --> 01:32:23.108
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1184
01:32:24.643 --> 01:32:26.712
- Holy shit!
- Yeah!

1185
01:32:33.619 --> 01:32:35.955
What the fuck did you guys do?

1186
01:32:36.088 --> 01:32:40.125
<i>Arson investigators</i>
<i>are on the premises...</i>

1187
01:32:44.964 --> 01:32:49.301
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions, sir.

1188
01:32:51.970 --> 01:32:55.273
<i>Police Commissioner Jacobs</i>
<i>is on the scene...</i>

1189
01:32:55.606 --> 01:32:59.277
The victory in the war against crime
will not come overnight.

1190
01:32:59.610 --> 01:33:03.982
It will take dedication and commitment
and, most of all, cooperation.

1191
01:33:04.115 --> 01:33:08.119
Streets are safer now.
There is hope in the inner city.

1192
01:33:08.252 --> 01:33:11.889
- However...
- I gotta take a piss.

1193
01:33:12.023 --> 01:33:17.128
These are the first steps in a long journey.
That is why we created Project Hope...

1194
01:33:17.261 --> 01:33:18.329
Bob.

1195
01:33:18.663 --> 01:33:22.367
..helping others
with prevention and enforcement.

1196
01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:27.405
Project Hope'll be a joint effort between
the police and community leaders.

1197
01:33:27.739 --> 01:33:31.843
It will be a powerful new weapon
in the war against crime.

1198
01:34:17.889 --> 01:34:22.760
- Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack.
- Man! His balls are ice-cold.

1199
01:34:23.728 --> 01:34:26.764
Hi. You're gonna call off
your rigorous investigation.

1200
01:34:26.898 --> 01:34:29.801
You will publicly state
there is no underground group,

1201
01:34:29.934 --> 01:34:32.470
or these guys are gonna take your balls.

1202
01:34:33.371 --> 01:34:37.208
They'll send one to the New York Times
and one to the LA Times.

1203
01:34:38.309 --> 01:34:41.979
Look, the people you are after
are the people you depend on.

1204
01:34:42.113 --> 01:34:45.917
We cook your meals. We haul your trash.
We connect your calls.

1205
01:34:46.050 --> 01:34:49.987
We drive your ambulances.
We guard you while you sleep.

1206
01:34:54.158 --> 01:34:56.994
Do not fuck with us.

1207
01:35:05.937 --> 01:35:07.738
Ball check!

1208
01:35:22.085 --> 01:35:23.987
Bob, this way.

1209
01:35:24.888 --> 01:35:26.323
Let's go.

1210
01:35:27.324 --> 01:35:30.527
<i>I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.</i>

1211
01:35:30.861 --> 01:35:32.896
Hey!

1212
01:35:47.277 --> 01:35:48.512
Yeah!

1213
01:36:21.411 --> 01:36:27.150
<i>I felt like putting a bullet in every panda</i>
<i>that wouldn't screw to save its species.</i>

1214
01:36:29.519 --> 01:36:32.355
<i>I wanted to open</i>
<i>the dump valves on oil tankers</i>

1215
01:36:32.489 --> 01:36:36.026
<i>and smother all those French beaches</i>
<i>I'd never see.</i>

1216
01:36:40.130 --> 01:36:42.566
<i>I wanted to breathe smoke.</i>

1217
01:36:59.182 --> 01:37:01.585
Where did you go, psycho boy?

1218
01:37:03.053 --> 01:37:05.989
I felt like destroying
something beautiful.

1219
01:37:10.093 --> 01:37:13.563
- Get him to a fucking hospital.
- Yeah.

1220
01:37:24.374 --> 01:37:28.945
Don't worry, Mr. Durden.
Airport parking. Long term.

1221
01:37:29.079 --> 01:37:31.114
After you, Mr. Durden.

1222
01:37:32.082 --> 01:37:34.150
After you.

1223
01:37:51.967 --> 01:37:54.403
- Something on your mind, dear?
- No.

1224
01:37:54.536 --> 01:37:57.339
Yeah. Why wasn't I told
about Project Mayhem?

1225
01:37:57.473 --> 01:38:01.377
First rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions.

1226
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:05.180
- Why wasn't I included in the beginning?
- Fight Club was the beginning.

1227
01:38:05.314 --> 01:38:08.350
Now it's left the basements
and it's Project Mayhem.

1228
01:38:08.484 --> 01:38:13.122
We started Fight Club together. Remember?
It's as much mine as it is yours.

1229
01:38:13.255 --> 01:38:17.393
- Is this about you and me?
- Yeah. Weren't we doing this together?

1230
01:38:17.526 --> 01:38:19.528
This does not belong to us.

1231
01:38:19.662 --> 01:38:23.465
- We are not special.
- Fuck that. You should have told me.

1232
01:38:24.333 --> 01:38:26.335
Hey, Tyler!

1233
01:38:28.203 --> 01:38:30.239
- Goddammit, Tyler!
- What do you want?

1234
01:38:30.372 --> 01:38:33.208
A statement of purpose?
Should I email you?

1235
01:38:33.342 --> 01:38:36.011
- Look...
- You decide your level of involvement!

1236
01:38:36.145 --> 01:38:38.614
I will! I wanna know certain things first!

1237
01:38:38.947 --> 01:38:41.417
- The first rule of Project Mayhem...
- Shut up!

1238
01:38:42.685 --> 01:38:47.022
- I wanna know what you're thinking.
- Fuck what you know!

1239
01:38:47.156 --> 01:38:50.426
Forget about what you think you know
about life, friendship,

1240
01:38:50.559 --> 01:38:52.594
and especially about you and me.

1241
01:38:54.196 --> 01:38:57.132
What is that supposed to mean? What...?

1242
01:38:59.368 --> 01:39:01.503
What are you doing?

1243
01:39:02.971 --> 01:39:05.207
What'll you wish you'd done
before you die?

1244
01:39:05.341 --> 01:39:08.143
- Paint a self-portrait.
- Build a house.

1245
01:39:08.277 --> 01:39:10.279
- And you?
- I don't know. Nothing.

1246
01:39:10.412 --> 01:39:13.115
- Get in the right lane.
- You have to know!

1247
01:39:13.248 --> 01:39:15.718
If you died now,
how would you feel about your life?

1248
01:39:16.051 --> 01:39:20.022
I don't know! Nothing good.
Is that what you want to hear me say?

1249
01:39:20.155 --> 01:39:22.324
- Come on!
- Not good enough.

1250
01:39:22.458 --> 01:39:24.993
Stop fucking around! Tyler!

1251
01:39:26.195 --> 01:39:28.397
Jesus Christ!

1252
01:39:29.198 --> 01:39:31.700
Goddammit! Goddammit! Fuck you!

1253
01:39:32.034 --> 01:39:36.205
Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!
I am sick of all your shit!

1254
01:39:37.172 --> 01:39:39.241
OK, man. OK.

1255
01:39:40.042 --> 01:39:42.444
- Quit screwing around. Steer!
- Look at you!

1256
01:39:42.578 --> 01:39:45.314
- Steer!
- Look at you! You're fucking pathetic!

1257
01:39:45.447 --> 01:39:50.519
- Why? What are you talking about?
- Why'd you think I blew up your condo?

1258
01:39:51.587 --> 01:39:52.621
What?

1259
01:39:52.755 --> 01:39:57.159
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.
It's not a goddamn seminar.

1260
01:39:57.292 --> 01:40:00.496
Stop trying to control everything
and just let go!

1261
01:40:03.364 --> 01:40:06.300
- Let go!
- All right. Fine.

1262
01:40:07.201 --> 01:40:09.137
Fine.

1263
01:41:07.428 --> 01:41:10.731
<i>I'd never been in a car accident.</i>

1264
01:41:10.865 --> 01:41:13.568
<i>This must have been</i>
<i>what all those people felt like</i>

1265
01:41:13.701 --> 01:41:16.804
<i>before I filed them</i>
<i>as statistics in my reports.</i>

1266
01:41:17.138 --> 01:41:19.173
Goddamn!

1267
01:41:22.410 --> 01:41:25.546
We've just had a near-life experience!

1268
01:41:30.451 --> 01:41:35.590
In the world I see, you're stalking elk
through the damp canyon forests

1269
01:41:35.723 --> 01:41:38.459
around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.

1270
01:41:40.461 --> 01:41:45.166
You'll wear leather clothes
that will last you the rest of your life.

1271
01:41:45.299 --> 01:41:50.338
You'll climb the thick kudzu vines
that wrap the Sears Tower.

1272
01:41:50.471 --> 01:41:54.809
And when you look down,
you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,

1273
01:41:55.142 --> 01:42:01.816
laying strips of venison in the empty car-pool
lane of some abandoned superhighway.

1274
01:42:13.561 --> 01:42:15.763
Feel better, champ.

1275
01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:34.915
<i>And then...</i>

1276
01:42:35.248 --> 01:42:36.550
Tyler?

1277
01:42:36.683 --> 01:42:38.718
..<i>Tyler was gone.</i>

1278
01:42:46.793 --> 01:42:48.862
<i>Was I asleep?</i>

1279
01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:51.364
<i>Had I slept?</i>

1280
01:42:51.498 --> 01:42:54.467
You are not
a beautiful, unique snowflake...

1281
01:42:54.601 --> 01:42:57.470
<i>The house had become a living thing,</i>

1282
01:42:57.604 --> 01:43:00.540
<i>wet inside from so many people</i>
<i>sweating and breathing.</i>

1283
01:43:00.674 --> 01:43:06.846
- We're all part of the same compost heap...
- <i>So many people moving, the house moved.</i>

1284
01:43:07.948 --> 01:43:09.716
<i>Planet Tyler.</i>

1285
01:43:09.849 --> 01:43:14.621
<i>I had to hug the walls, trapped inside</i>
<i>this clockwork of space monkeys.</i>

1286
01:43:14.754 --> 01:43:17.924
You can't be smoking!
You know how much ether is in here?

1287
01:43:18.258 --> 01:43:21.628
<i>Cooking and working</i>
<i>and sleeping in teams.</i>

1288
01:43:24.331 --> 01:43:25.899
Hang on a second.

1289
01:43:45.685 --> 01:43:48.555
It's under control, sir.

1290
01:43:50.457 --> 01:43:51.791
Where's Tyler?

1291
01:43:51.925 --> 01:43:54.861
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not...

1292
01:43:54.995 --> 01:43:56.930
Right. OK.

1293
01:43:59.466 --> 01:44:01.534
<i>I'm all alone.</i>

1294
01:44:01.668 --> 01:44:05.372
<i>My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.</i>

1295
01:44:05.505 --> 01:44:07.674
<i>I am Jack's broken heart.</i>

1296
01:44:11.845 --> 01:44:16.516
<i>What comes next in Project Mayhem,</i>
<i>only Tyler knows.</i>

1297
01:44:16.650 --> 01:44:20.420
<i>The second rule</i>
<i>is you do not ask questions.</i>

1298
01:44:22.622 --> 01:44:25.392
Get the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away!

1299
01:44:26.559 --> 01:44:28.962
Who are all these people?

1300
01:44:32.932 --> 01:44:35.735
The Paper Street Soap Company.

1301
01:44:37.871 --> 01:44:39.506
Can I come in?

1302
01:44:42.776 --> 01:44:44.844
He's not here.

1303
01:44:44.978 --> 01:44:46.479
What?

1304
01:44:47.547 --> 01:44:50.984
Tyler isn't here.

1305
01:44:51.317 --> 01:44:53.585
Tyler went away.

1306
01:44:53.719 --> 01:44:55.754
Tyler's gone.

1307
01:45:11.670 --> 01:45:14.540
Jesus! Get some help!

1308
01:45:26.351 --> 01:45:30.589
Two gunshot wounds coming through!
Make some fucking room!

1309
01:45:30.723 --> 01:45:32.558
What happened? What happened?

1310
01:45:32.691 --> 01:45:37.096
We were on assignment. We were
supposed to kill two birds with one stone.

1311
01:45:37.429 --> 01:45:39.431
Destroy a piece of corporate art...

1312
01:45:39.565 --> 01:45:41.967
Operation Latte Thunder. Go!

1313
01:45:43.869 --> 01:45:45.804
..and trash a franchise coffee bar.

1314
01:45:52.144 --> 01:45:54.613
We had it all worked out, sir.

1315
01:46:02.755 --> 01:46:05.958
- It went smooth until...
- Police! Freeze!

1316
01:46:06.091 --> 01:46:08.861
- What?
- They shot Bob.

1317
01:46:10.462 --> 01:46:13.398
- They shot him in the head.
- Fucking pigs!

1318
01:46:18.103 --> 01:46:20.105
Oh, God!

1319
01:46:20.439 --> 01:46:24.109
- Those motherfuckers!
- You morons.

1320
01:46:24.443 --> 01:46:27.446
You run around in ski masks
trying to blow things up?

1321
01:46:27.579 --> 01:46:30.582
What did you think was gonna happen?

1322
01:46:33.085 --> 01:46:36.655
OK, quick! We gotta
get rid of the evidence - this body!

1323
01:46:36.789 --> 01:46:38.957
- Bury him.
- What?

1324
01:46:39.091 --> 01:46:41.927
Take him to the garden and bury him.

1325
01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:46.632
- Come on, people, let's go!
- Get the fuck off! Get away from him!

1326
01:46:46.765 --> 01:46:50.869
What are you talking about? This
isn't fucking evidence. This is a person.

1327
01:46:51.003 --> 01:46:54.106
He's my friend and you're
not burying him in the garden!

1328
01:46:54.439 --> 01:46:57.176
He was killed
serving Project Mayhem, sir.

1329
01:46:57.509 --> 01:46:59.478
- This is Bob.
- But, sir, in...

1330
01:46:59.611 --> 01:47:02.080
in Project Mayhem, we have no names.

1331
01:47:02.214 --> 01:47:08.153
You listen to me. This is a man and he
has a name, it's Robert Paulsen, OK?

1332
01:47:08.487 --> 01:47:09.521
Robert Paulsen?

1333
01:47:09.655 --> 01:47:14.660
He's a man, and he's dead now because
of us. Do you understand that?

1334
01:47:14.793 --> 01:47:16.128
I understand.

1335
01:47:18.529 --> 01:47:24.702
In death, a member of Project Mayhem
has a name.

1336
01:47:24.836 --> 01:47:27.004
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1337
01:47:27.538 --> 01:47:29.607
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1338
01:47:30.241 --> 01:47:32.977
His name... is Robert Paulsen.

1339
01:47:34.178 --> 01:47:36.881
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1340
01:47:37.014 --> 01:47:42.753
- Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.
- His name is Robert Paulsen.

1341
01:47:42.887 --> 01:47:45.923
Shut up! This is all over with!

1342
01:48:21.192 --> 01:48:24.829
- Tyler?
- No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit.

1343
01:48:24.962 --> 01:48:26.631
I need to see you...

1344
01:48:31.002 --> 01:48:35.773
<i>I went to all the cities on Tyler's</i>
<i>used ticket stubs, bar-hopping.</i>

1345
01:48:35.907 --> 01:48:40.578
<i>I didn't know how, but I could look at 50</i>
<i>different bars, and somehow I just knew.</i>

1346
01:48:40.711 --> 01:48:44.649
I'm looking for Tyler Durden.
It's very important that I talk to him.

1347
01:48:45.049 --> 01:48:47.118
I wish I could help you,

1348
01:48:47.251 --> 01:48:48.753
sir.

1349
01:48:54.692 --> 01:48:57.595
<i>Every city I went to,</i>

1350
01:48:57.728 --> 01:48:59.997
<i>as soon as I set foot off the plane,</i>

1351
01:49:00.131 --> 01:49:02.566
<i>I knew a Fight Club was close.</i>

1352
01:49:03.267 --> 01:49:05.102
Hey! Hey!

1353
01:49:05.236 --> 01:49:06.837
Taxi!

1354
01:49:06.971 --> 01:49:11.676
Look at my face. I'm a member. Now,
I just need to know if you've seen Tyler.

1355
01:49:11.809 --> 01:49:15.313
I'm not exposed to bespeak
any such information to you,

1356
01:49:15.646 --> 01:49:20.184
nor would I, even if I had said
information at this juncture, be able.

1357
01:49:21.752 --> 01:49:24.722
- You're a moron.
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1358
01:49:25.957 --> 01:49:30.995
<i>Tyler had been busy, setting</i>
<i>up franchises all over the country.</i>

1359
01:49:33.798 --> 01:49:38.135
<i>Was I asleep? Had I slept?</i>

1360
01:49:38.269 --> 01:49:41.838
<i>Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?</i>

1361
01:49:41.972 --> 01:49:44.374
- We've just heard the stories.
- What stories?

1362
01:49:44.708 --> 01:49:49.245
- Nobody knows what he looks like.
- He has plastic surgery every three years.

1363
01:49:49.379 --> 01:49:51.781
That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.

1364
01:49:51.915 --> 01:49:56.653
- Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?
- Is Mr. Durden building an army?

1365
01:49:56.786 --> 01:50:01.024
<i>I was living in a state</i>
<i>of perpetual déjà vu.</i>

1366
01:50:01.157 --> 01:50:04.728
<i>Everywhere I went,</i>
<i>I felt I'd already been there.</i>

1367
01:50:04.861 --> 01:50:07.764
<i>It was like following an invisible man.</i>

1368
01:50:08.832 --> 01:50:10.934
<i>The smell of dried blood.</i>

1369
01:50:12.002 --> 01:50:14.971
<i>Dirty, bare footprints circling each other.</i>

1370
01:50:15.105 --> 01:50:18.408
<i>That aroma of old sweat,</i>
<i>like fried chicken.</i>

1371
01:50:18.742 --> 01:50:22.946
<i>The feel of a floor still warm</i>
<i>from a fight the night before.</i>

1372
01:50:23.079 --> 01:50:25.982
<i>I was always just one step behind Tyler.</i>

1373
01:50:28.685 --> 01:50:33.923
His name is Robert Paulsen.
His name is Robert Paulsen. His...

1374
01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:38.928
Welcome back, sir.

1375
01:50:39.963 --> 01:50:41.865
How have you been?

1376
01:50:42.866 --> 01:50:44.868
Do you know me?

1377
01:50:45.001 --> 01:50:48.438
- Is this a test, sir?
- No. This is not a test.

1378
01:50:49.439 --> 01:50:52.175
You were in here last Thursday.

1379
01:50:52.308 --> 01:50:54.044
Thursday?

1380
01:50:54.177 --> 01:50:58.848
You were standing where you are now,
asking how good security is.

1381
01:50:58.982 --> 01:51:01.418
It's tight as a drum, sir.

1382
01:51:03.119 --> 01:51:05.288
Who do you think I am?

1383
01:51:05.922 --> 01:51:09.993
- Are you sure this isn't a test?
- No, this is not a test.

1384
01:51:10.994 --> 01:51:13.430
You're Mr. Durden.

1385
01:51:13.763 --> 01:51:16.132
You're the one who gave me this.

1386
01:51:17.033 --> 01:51:21.938
<i>Please return your seat backs</i>
<i>to their full upright and locked position.</i>

1387
01:51:32.382 --> 01:51:33.917
- Yeah?
- <i>Marla, it's me.</i>

1388
01:51:34.050 --> 01:51:36.186
- Have we ever done it?
- Done what?

1389
01:51:36.319 --> 01:51:39.756
- Had sex.
- What kind of stupid question is that?

1390
01:51:39.889 --> 01:51:42.492
Stupid because the answer's yes
or because it's no?

1391
01:51:42.826 --> 01:51:44.828
- Is this a trick?
- No. I need to know...

1392
01:51:44.961 --> 01:51:48.832
You wanna know if I think
we were just having sex or making love?

1393
01:51:49.365 --> 01:51:52.202
- We did make love?
- Is that what you're calling it?

1394
01:51:52.335 --> 01:51:55.472
Just answer the question!
Did we do it or not?

1395
01:51:55.805 --> 01:51:58.341
You fuck me, then snub me.
You love me, you hate me.

1396
01:51:58.475 --> 01:52:01.244
You're sensitive,
then you turn into an asshole.

1397
01:52:01.377 --> 01:52:03.913
Does that describe our relationship,
Tyler?

1398
01:52:04.047 --> 01:52:06.349
<i>We have just lost cabin pressure.</i>

1399
01:52:06.482 --> 01:52:08.817
- What did you say?
- What is wrong with you?

1400
01:52:08.951 --> 01:52:10.953
- Say my name!
- Tyler Durden.

1401
01:52:11.086 --> 01:52:13.856
Tyler Durden, you fucking freak!
What's going on?

1402
01:52:13.989 --> 01:52:16.024
- I'm coming over!
- I'm not there!

1403
01:52:18.026 --> 01:52:20.062
You broke your promise.

1404
01:52:20.195 --> 01:52:22.531
- Jesus, Tyler.
- You talked to her about me.

1405
01:52:22.865 --> 01:52:27.436
- What the fuck is going on?
- I ask you for one thing. One thing.

1406
01:52:27.769 --> 01:52:30.906
Why do people think that I'm you?

1407
01:52:31.039 --> 01:52:33.075
Answer me!

1408
01:52:36.211 --> 01:52:37.279
Sit.

1409
01:52:40.482 --> 01:52:43.852
Answer me.
Why do people think I'm you?

1410
01:52:43.986 --> 01:52:45.521
I think you know.

1411
01:52:45.854 --> 01:52:47.789
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

1412
01:52:47.923 --> 01:52:51.293
Why would anyone
possibly confuse you with me?

1413
01:52:51.426 --> 01:52:53.395
I... I don't know.

1414
01:52:58.200 --> 01:53:00.502
- You got it.
- No.

1415
01:53:00.836 --> 01:53:03.272
- Do not fuck with us!
- Say it.

1416
01:53:04.573 --> 01:53:06.842
Because...

1417
01:53:08.110 --> 01:53:09.244
Say it!

1418
01:53:11.079 --> 01:53:13.949
Because we're the same person.

1419
01:53:14.082 --> 01:53:15.117
That's right.

1420
01:53:15.250 --> 01:53:17.352
We are the all-singing, all-dancing...

1421
01:53:17.486 --> 01:53:21.190
- I don't understand this.
- You wanted a way to change your life.

1422
01:53:21.323 --> 01:53:23.559
You could not do this on your own.

1423
01:53:23.892 --> 01:53:28.030
All the ways you wish you could be -
that's me.

1424
01:53:28.163 --> 01:53:30.599
I look like you wanna look,
fuck like you wanna fuck,

1425
01:53:30.933 --> 01:53:35.971
I am smart, capable, most importantly,
I'm free in all the ways that you are not.

1426
01:53:36.104 --> 01:53:37.139
Oh, no.

1427
01:53:37.272 --> 01:53:40.108
- Tyler's not here. Tyler went away.
- What?

1428
01:53:40.242 --> 01:53:44.546
- This is impossible. This is crazy.
- People do it every day.

1429
01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:48.483
They talk to themselves.
They see themselves as they'd like to be.

1430
01:53:48.617 --> 01:53:51.553
They don't have the courage you have
to just run with it.

1431
01:53:55.357 --> 01:53:58.627
You still wrestle with it,
so sometimes you're still you.

1432
01:53:58.961 --> 01:54:00.562
We should do this again sometime.

1433
01:54:00.896 --> 01:54:03.498
Other times,
you imagine you're watching me.

1434
01:54:03.632 --> 01:54:06.168
If this is your first time,
you have to fight.

1435
01:54:06.301 --> 01:54:10.973
Little by little,
you're just letting yourself become...

1436
01:54:12.007 --> 01:54:13.342
Tyler Durden.

1437
01:54:13.475 --> 01:54:16.245
You are not your job
or how much money you have!

1438
01:54:16.378 --> 01:54:18.647
- No. You have a house.
- Rented in your name.

1439
01:54:18.981 --> 01:54:22.417
- You have jobs, a life.
- You work nights because you can't sleep.

1440
01:54:22.551 --> 01:54:26.188
- Or you stay up and make soap.
- You're fucking Marla, Tyler.

1441
01:54:26.321 --> 01:54:29.391
Technically, you are.
But it's all the same to her.

1442
01:54:31.525 --> 01:54:33.928
Oh, my God.

1443
01:54:34.061 --> 01:54:36.230
Now you see our dilemma.

1444
01:54:36.364 --> 01:54:38.566
She knows too much.

1445
01:54:39.433 --> 01:54:44.605
I think we're gonna have to talk about
how this might compromise our goals.

1446
01:54:44.939 --> 01:54:46.974
What... what are you saying?

1447
01:54:47.108 --> 01:54:51.245
This is bullshit. This is bullshit!
I'm not listening to this.

1448
01:54:51.379 --> 01:54:54.048
- You are insane!
- No. You're insane.

1449
01:54:54.181 --> 01:54:56.951
And we simply do not have time
for this crap.

1450
01:54:59.186 --> 01:55:05.993
<i>It's called a changeover. The movie goes</i>
<i>on, nobody in the audience has any idea.</i>

1451
01:55:18.973 --> 01:55:22.476
- Sir! Are you checking out?
- Yeah. Bill me.

1452
01:55:22.610 --> 01:55:26.347
I need you to initial
this list of phone calls, please.

1453
01:55:29.450 --> 01:55:33.487
- When were these made?
- Between 2:00 and 3:30 this morning.

1454
01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:43.464
<i>Have I been going to bed earlier every</i>
<i>night? Have I been sleeping later?</i>

1455
01:55:44.999 --> 01:55:48.436
<i>Have I been Tyler longer and longer?</i>

1456
01:55:51.639 --> 01:55:53.708
Is anybody here?

1457
01:55:55.710 --> 01:55:58.179
<i>Déjà vu, all over again.</i>

1458
01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:02.283
With enough soap,
one could blow up anything.

1459
01:56:05.186 --> 01:56:07.154
Oh, my God.

1460
01:56:10.257 --> 01:56:12.593
- <i>1888.</i>
- Who am I calling?

1461
01:56:12.727 --> 01:56:16.530
<i>1888 Franklin. This is Maintenance.</i>

1462
01:56:16.664 --> 01:56:19.200
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

1463
01:56:19.333 --> 01:56:22.036
1888 Franklin Street?

1464
01:56:22.169 --> 01:56:24.205
<i>Yes. Can I help you?</i>

1465
01:56:26.574 --> 01:56:29.210
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Yeah, yeah.

1466
01:56:29.343 --> 01:56:31.712
I need to talk to your supervisor
right away.

1467
01:56:32.046 --> 01:56:34.048
- Speaking.
- OK, listen to me.

1468
01:56:34.181 --> 01:56:37.251
Something terrible
is about to happen to your building.

1469
01:56:37.385 --> 01:56:39.687
<i>It's under control, sir.</i>

1470
01:56:40.021 --> 01:56:43.424
- Excuse me?
- Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.

1471
01:56:56.603 --> 01:56:59.205
Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!

1472
01:57:00.607 --> 01:57:03.643
Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!

1473
01:57:03.777 --> 01:57:08.181
Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking
broom! They almost broke my arm!

1474
01:57:08.314 --> 01:57:11.084
They were burning their fingertips
with lye.

1475
01:57:11.217 --> 01:57:14.687
It'll take a tremendous act of faith
on your part, but hear me out.

1476
01:57:14.821 --> 01:57:18.792
- Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
- A little more faith than that.

1477
01:57:23.129 --> 01:57:27.233
- I don't wanna hear anything you have to say.
- You have every right to be...

1478
01:57:27.367 --> 01:57:29.302
I'll just have a coffee, thanks.

1479
01:57:29.436 --> 01:57:32.839
Sir, anything you order
is free of charge, sir.

1480
01:57:33.173 --> 01:57:35.608
- Why is it free of charge?
- Don't ask.

1481
01:57:35.742 --> 01:57:37.210
Whatever.

1482
01:57:37.343 --> 01:57:42.215
I'll have the clam chowder, fried chicken,
a baked potato, chocolate chiffon pie.

1483
01:57:42.348 --> 01:57:44.350
Clean food, please.

1484
01:57:44.484 --> 01:57:47.454
In that case, sir,
I advise against the clam chowder.

1485
01:57:47.587 --> 01:57:49.622
No clam chowder. Thank you.

1486
01:57:51.191 --> 01:57:53.426
You got about 30 seconds.

1487
01:57:56.129 --> 01:57:58.765
I know I've been acting very strange,
OK?

1488
01:57:59.099 --> 01:58:03.837
- I know it seems there's two sides to me...
- Two sides? You're Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jackass.

1489
01:58:04.170 --> 01:58:07.207
I deserved that.
But I realized something important.

1490
01:58:07.340 --> 01:58:08.341
What?

1491
01:58:08.475 --> 01:58:13.746
The full extent of our relationship wasn't clear
to me until now, for reasons I won't go into.

1492
01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:16.483
- I know I haven't treated you well.
- Whatever.

1493
01:58:16.616 --> 01:58:21.521
No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!
Fifteen seconds, don't open your mouth.

1494
01:58:21.654 --> 01:58:23.756
I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.

1495
01:58:23.890 --> 01:58:28.328
What I've come to realize
is that I really like you, Marla.

1496
01:58:29.429 --> 01:58:31.831
- You do?
- I really do.

1497
01:58:32.165 --> 01:58:37.337
I care about you, I don't want anything
bad to happen to you because of me.

1498
01:58:37.470 --> 01:58:39.672
Your life is in danger.

1499
01:58:41.207 --> 01:58:43.843
- What?
- You need to leave town for a while.

1500
01:58:44.177 --> 01:58:48.348
- Get out of any major city. Go camping...
- You're an insane person.

1501
01:58:48.481 --> 01:58:51.784
- I've involved you in something terrible.
- No. Shut up!

1502
01:58:51.918 --> 01:58:54.521
- You're not safe.
- Shut up!

1503
01:58:56.656 --> 01:59:00.693
- Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.
- I know you did.

1504
01:59:00.827 --> 01:59:06.633
There are things about you I like.
You're smart, funny, spectacular in bed.

1505
01:59:06.766 --> 01:59:09.836
But... you're intolerable.

1506
01:59:10.170 --> 01:59:15.708
You have very serious emotional problems
for which you should seek professional help.

1507
01:59:15.842 --> 01:59:20.445
- I know, and I'm sorry.
- You're sorry, I'm sorry, everyone's sorry.

1508
01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:24.216
I can't do this anymore.

1509
01:59:24.349 --> 01:59:26.818
I can't. I won't.

1510
01:59:28.520 --> 01:59:33.792
- I'm gone.
- You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!

1511
01:59:36.528 --> 01:59:38.897
- Marla, you don't understand!
- Leave me alone!

1512
01:59:39.231 --> 01:59:40.732
I am trying to protect you!

1513
01:59:40.866 --> 01:59:43.869
- I never want to see you again!
- If that's what it takes...

1514
01:59:44.203 --> 01:59:46.238
Wait right here.

1515
01:59:50.209 --> 01:59:52.611
Hold it right there! Shut up!

1516
01:59:52.744 --> 01:59:56.982
Take this money and get on this bus.
I promise I will never bother you again.

1517
01:59:57.316 --> 01:59:58.617
Shut up!

1518
01:59:58.750 --> 02:00:01.887
Please get on the bus.
Please get on the bus.

1519
02:00:03.722 --> 02:00:06.625
- Why are you doing this?
- They think you're a threat.

1520
02:00:06.758 --> 02:00:10.829
I can't explain now. Trust me. If I see
where you're going, you won't be safe.

1521
02:00:10.963 --> 02:00:13.765
I'm not paying this back.
I consider it asshole tax.

1522
02:00:13.899 --> 02:00:17.536
Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities
for a couple of days, OK?

1523
02:00:17.669 --> 02:00:19.771
Tyler...

1524
02:00:20.339 --> 02:00:24.309
You're the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

1525
02:00:37.689 --> 02:00:40.392
Hello. I need you to arrest me.

1526
02:00:40.525 --> 02:00:43.262
I am the leader
of a terrorist organization

1527
02:00:43.395 --> 02:00:48.300
responsible for numerous acts of
vandalism and assault all over this city.

1528
02:00:48.433 --> 02:00:52.271
In the metropolitan area,
we had probably 200 members.

1529
02:00:52.404 --> 02:00:56.008
Chapters have sprung up
in five or six other major cities already.

1530
02:00:56.341 --> 02:00:59.344
This is a tightly regimented organization

1531
02:00:59.478 --> 02:01:04.950
with many cells capable of operating
independent of central leadership.

1532
02:01:05.284 --> 02:01:10.889
Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street.
That's our headquarters.

1533
02:01:11.023 --> 02:01:16.795
In the back, buried in the garden,
you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.

1534
02:01:17.596 --> 02:01:19.865
In the basement, you'll find bathtubs

1535
02:01:19.998 --> 02:01:25.604
that have been used very recently
to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.

1536
02:01:25.737 --> 02:01:30.442
I believe the plan is to blow up the
headquarters of these credit-card companies

1537
02:01:30.575 --> 02:01:32.611
and the TRW building.

1538
02:01:33.979 --> 02:01:37.416
Why these buildings?
Why credit-card companies?

1539
02:01:37.549 --> 02:01:41.787
If you erase the debt record,
then we all go back to zero.

1540
02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:43.955
You'll create total chaos.

1541
02:01:45.623 --> 02:01:49.860
Keep him talking.
I need to make a phone call.

1542
02:01:59.737 --> 02:02:02.606
I really admire what you're doing.

1543
02:02:03.441 --> 02:02:06.877
- What?
- You're a brave man to order this.

1544
02:02:07.011 --> 02:02:08.779
You're a genius, sir.

1545
02:02:08.913 --> 02:02:13.951
You said if anyone ever interferes
with Project Mayhem, even you,

1546
02:02:14.085 --> 02:02:16.754
we gotta get his balls.

1547
02:02:16.887 --> 02:02:19.957
- Don't fight.
- It's a powerful gesture, Mr. Durden.

1548
02:02:20.091 --> 02:02:23.461
- It'll set quite an example.
- You're making a big mistake!

1549
02:02:23.594 --> 02:02:25.996
- You said you'd say that.
- I'm not Tyler Durden!

1550
02:02:26.130 --> 02:02:28.632
You told us you'd say that too.

1551
02:02:28.766 --> 02:02:30.768
All right. I am Tyler Durden.

1552
02:02:30.901 --> 02:02:35.473
Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct
order. We're aborting this mission now.

1553
02:02:35.606 --> 02:02:38.442
You said you would definitely say that.

1554
02:02:39.844 --> 02:02:41.579
Let me go!

1555
02:02:42.813 --> 02:02:46.817
Are you fucking out of your minds?
You're police officers!

1556
02:02:48.052 --> 02:02:49.754
Is somebody timing this?

1557
02:02:49.887 --> 02:02:52.790
Keep your mouth shut.

1558
02:02:52.923 --> 02:02:54.959
Shit!

1559
02:02:57.661 --> 02:03:00.865
- Some of this information checks out.
- Uh-huh?

1560
02:03:00.998 --> 02:03:04.668
- Let's go to that house on Paper Street.
- Be right there.

1561
02:03:04.802 --> 02:03:06.170
Hey, wait!

1562
02:03:06.504 --> 02:03:07.571
- Got him?
- I got him.

1563
02:03:07.705 --> 02:03:09.540
Sir, we have to do this.

1564
02:03:09.673 --> 02:03:12.009
- Stop fighting!
- Where's the rubber band?

1565
02:03:12.143 --> 02:03:14.745
Get away from me!
Drop that fucking knife!

1566
02:03:18.516 --> 02:03:21.719
Back up.
Face down on the floor right now!

1567
02:03:24.054 --> 02:03:26.123
Get down on the floor!

1568
02:03:30.561 --> 02:03:34.698
First person that comes out this door
gets a lead salad! Understand?

1569
02:03:58.956 --> 02:04:01.625
Get away! Stay away!

1570
02:04:14.571 --> 02:04:16.973
<i>I ran.</i>

1571
02:04:17.106 --> 02:04:22.612
<i>I ran until my muscles burned</i>
<i>and my veins pumped battery acid.</i>

1572
02:04:23.913 --> 02:04:25.982
<i>Then I ran some more.</i>

1573
02:05:07.257 --> 02:05:12.028
What are you doing, running around
in your underpants? You look crazy!

1574
02:05:12.161 --> 02:05:15.164
No. I'm onto you.
I know what's going on here.

1575
02:05:15.298 --> 02:05:20.236
Come on, then. I got us a great place
to watch from. It'll be like pay-per-view.

1576
02:06:08.184 --> 02:06:10.019
Oh, Christ.

1577
02:06:10.153 --> 02:06:12.055
Now what are you doing?

1578
02:06:12.188 --> 02:06:14.257
- I'm stopping this.
- Why?

1579
02:06:14.591 --> 02:06:18.595
- The greatest thing you've ever done.
- I can't let this happen.

1580
02:06:18.728 --> 02:06:21.097
There are 10 other bombs
in 10 other buildings.

1581
02:06:21.230 --> 02:06:23.666
Since when is Project Mayhem
about murder?

1582
02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:28.671
The buildings are empty. We're not
killing anyone. We're setting 'em free!

1583
02:06:28.805 --> 02:06:32.141
Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.

1584
02:06:32.275 --> 02:06:34.943
You wanna make an omelet,
you gotta break eggs.

1585
02:06:35.077 --> 02:06:38.714
I'm not listening to you.
You're not even there.

1586
02:06:45.220 --> 02:06:48.991
Wouldn't do that. Not unless
I knew which wires were what.

1587
02:06:49.124 --> 02:06:50.892
If you know, then I know.

1588
02:06:56.365 --> 02:07:01.970
Or maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent
all day thinking about the wrong ones.

1589
02:07:09.311 --> 02:07:10.379
You think?

1590
02:07:12.347 --> 02:07:14.650
Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.

1591
02:07:15.083 --> 02:07:18.353
Pull any one but the green one.

1592
02:07:22.658 --> 02:07:25.794
I asked you not to do that!

1593
02:07:27.663 --> 02:07:29.131
Fuck!

1594
02:07:30.065 --> 02:07:32.200
Tyler, get away from the van.

1595
02:07:34.336 --> 02:07:37.806
Tyler, I'm not kidding!
Get away from the van!

1596
02:07:37.939 --> 02:07:39.307
Goddammit!

1597
02:07:40.375 --> 02:07:43.011
Whoa! Whoa!

1598
02:07:45.681 --> 02:07:46.948
OK.

1599
02:07:47.082 --> 02:07:50.318
You are now firing a gun
at your imaginary friend

1600
02:07:50.452 --> 02:07:53.121
near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!

1601
02:07:55.257 --> 02:07:57.059
Cool it, Tyler!

1602
02:08:10.439 --> 02:08:13.408
Aw, come on! Don't go!

1603
02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:53.281
What?

1604
02:09:39.126 --> 02:09:42.530
Three minutes. This is it.

1605
02:09:42.863 --> 02:09:44.832
The beginning.

1606
02:09:44.965 --> 02:09:46.867
Ground zero.

1607
02:09:47.001 --> 02:09:51.806
- <i>I think this is about where we came in.</i>
- Want to say a few words for the occasion?

1608
02:09:51.939 --> 02:09:54.909
I'm sorry?

1609
02:09:55.042 --> 02:09:57.845
I still can't think of anything.

1610
02:09:59.113 --> 02:10:01.182
Ah. Flashback humor.

1611
02:10:06.821 --> 02:10:09.323
It's getting exciting now.

1612
02:10:10.391 --> 02:10:14.328
Two and a half.
Think of everything we've accomplished.

1613
02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:19.934
Out these windows, we will view
the collapse of financial history.

1614
02:10:20.067 --> 02:10:23.037
One step closer
to economic equilibrium.

1615
02:10:37.885 --> 02:10:40.988
- Why is she here?
- I'm tying up loose ends.

1616
02:10:41.121 --> 02:10:44.124
Put me down, you bald-headed fuck!

1617
02:10:44.258 --> 02:10:49.263
- I'm begging you, please don't do this.
- I'm not doing this. We are doing this.

1618
02:10:49.396 --> 02:10:52.333
- This is what we want.
- No. I don't want this.

1619
02:10:52.466 --> 02:10:58.172
Right. Except "you" is meaningless now.
We have to forget about you.

1620
02:10:58.305 --> 02:11:01.108
- You're a voice in my head.
- You're a voice in mine!

1621
02:11:01.242 --> 02:11:03.978
You're a hallucination.
Why can't I get rid of you?

1622
02:11:04.111 --> 02:11:07.047
- You need me.
- No. I don't. I really don't any more.

1623
02:11:07.181 --> 02:11:11.352
You created me. I didn't create some
loser alter ego to make me feel better.

1624
02:11:11.485 --> 02:11:13.954
- Take some responsibility.
- I do.

1625
02:11:14.088 --> 02:11:17.258
I am responsible for all of it,
and I accept that.

1626
02:11:17.391 --> 02:11:21.428
So, please, I'm begging you,
please call this off.

1627
02:11:23.397 --> 02:11:25.598
Have I ever let us down?

1628
02:11:27.100 --> 02:11:29.402
How far have you come because of me?!

1629
02:11:35.275 --> 02:11:37.310
I will bring us through this.

1630
02:11:37.443 --> 02:11:41.214
As always, I will carry you
kicking and screaming,

1631
02:11:41.347 --> 02:11:43.683
and in the end you will thank me.

1632
02:11:44.250 --> 02:11:46.619
Tyler. Tyler.

1633
02:11:46.953 --> 02:11:50.356
I'm grateful to you
for everything that you've done for me.

1634
02:11:50.490 --> 02:11:53.126
But this is too much. I don't want this.

1635
02:11:53.259 --> 02:11:58.097
What do you want? Your shit job back?
Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?

1636
02:11:58.231 --> 02:12:00.300
Fuck you! I won't do it.

1637
02:12:01.467 --> 02:12:05.571
- This can't be happening.
- It's already done, so shut up!

1638
02:12:05.705 --> 02:12:09.275
- 60 seconds till CRI.
- No.

1639
02:12:11.044 --> 02:12:14.213
I can figure this out. This isn't even real.

1640
02:12:14.347 --> 02:12:18.184
You're not real. That gun...
that gun isn't even in your hand.

1641
02:12:19.218 --> 02:12:21.287
The gun's in my hand.

1642
02:12:26.626 --> 02:12:29.228
Good for you. It doesn't change a thing.

1643
02:12:38.171 --> 02:12:40.673
Why do you wanna
put a gun to your head?

1644
02:12:41.541 --> 02:12:43.509
Not my head, Tyler.

1645
02:12:43.643 --> 02:12:45.511
Our head.

1646
02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:49.148
Interesting.

1647
02:12:52.418 --> 02:12:54.721
Where are you going with this,
IKEA boy?

1648
02:13:01.260 --> 02:13:04.263
Hey. It's you and me.

1649
02:13:07.767 --> 02:13:09.736
Friends?

1650
02:13:10.636 --> 02:13:12.271
Tyler,

1651
02:13:15.375 --> 02:13:17.710
I want you to really listen to me.

1652
02:13:18.578 --> 02:13:20.346
OK.

1653
02:13:21.714 --> 02:13:23.783
My eyes are open.

1654
02:13:41.134 --> 02:13:43.302
What's that smell?

1655
02:14:03.522 --> 02:14:07.292
- Where is everybody?
- Oh, no. What's going on?

1656
02:14:07.426 --> 02:14:09.127
Mr. Durden!

1657
02:14:09.261 --> 02:14:11.129
Oh, my God!

1658
02:14:11.696 --> 02:14:13.265
Sir!

1659
02:14:16.401 --> 02:14:19.538
Are you... are you all right, sir?

1660
02:14:19.671 --> 02:14:23.575
- Oh, yeah, I'm OK.
- You look terrible, sir. What happened?

1661
02:14:23.708 --> 02:14:27.646
- Oh, nothing. It's no problem.
- No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.

1662
02:14:27.779 --> 02:14:31.716
- You look awful. You need assistance.
- I'm fine.

1663
02:14:31.850 --> 02:14:34.553
Look, I'm fine. Everything's fine.

1664
02:14:36.555 --> 02:14:38.723
Ow! Stop it!

1665
02:14:38.857 --> 02:14:41.760
- Let her go.
- Christ Almighty!

1666
02:14:42.594 --> 02:14:43.862
You!

1667
02:14:44.563 --> 02:14:46.531
Hi, Marla.

1668
02:14:47.232 --> 02:14:50.202
Leave her with me.
I'll meet you downstairs.

1669
02:14:50.335 --> 02:14:53.572
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1670
02:14:55.140 --> 02:14:59.311
You fucker! What sick fucking game
are you playing at, putting me on a...?

1671
02:14:59.444 --> 02:15:01.546
Oh, my God, your face!

1672
02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:03.281
Yeah, I know.

1673
02:15:08.620 --> 02:15:11.156
- What happened?
- Don't ask.

1674
02:15:11.289 --> 02:15:13.291
- You're shot.
- Yes, I'm shot.

1675
02:15:13.425 --> 02:15:15.160
Oh, my God.

1676
02:15:15.293 --> 02:15:18.296
- I can't believe he's standing.
- Tough motherfucker.

1677
02:15:22.634 --> 02:15:24.603
Who did this?

1678
02:15:24.736 --> 02:15:26.838
I did, actually.

1679
02:15:27.172 --> 02:15:29.207
Find some gauze.

1680
02:15:29.875 --> 02:15:34.679
- You shot yourself?
- Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me.

1681
02:15:34.813 --> 02:15:37.182
I'm really OK.

1682
02:15:37.782 --> 02:15:41.253
Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine.

1683
02:15:53.865 --> 02:15:57.836
You met me
at a very strange time in my life.
