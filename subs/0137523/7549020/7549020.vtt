00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.470
<font color=#80ffff><i>People are always ask me
if I know Tyler Durden.</i></font>

2
00:02:08.507 --> 00:02:09.463
Three minutes.

3
00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:10.973
This is it.

4
00:02:11.248 --> 00:02:12.374
Ground zero.

5
00:02:13.042 --> 00:02:15.201
Do you have a speech for the occasion?

6
00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.862
<font color=#80ffff><i>With a gun barrel between your teeth,
you speak only in vowels.</i></font>

7
00:02:19.995 --> 00:02:21.409
I can't think of anything.

8
00:02:21.573 --> 00:02:25.906
<font color=#80ffff><i>For a second, I totally forget about
Tyler's controlled demolition thing</i></font>

9
00:02:25.965 --> 00:02:28.125
<font color=#80ffff><i>and I wonder how clean that gun is.</i></font>

10
00:02:28.227 --> 00:02:29.486
It's getting exciting now.

11
00:02:30.155 --> 00:02:32.866
<font color=#80ffff><i>That old thing,
how you always hurt the one you love.</i></font>

12
00:02:33.346 --> 00:02:34.860
<font color=#80ffff><i>Well, it works both ways.</i></font>

13
00:02:35.974 --> 00:02:39.395
<font color=#80ffff><i>We have frontrow seats
for this theater of mass destruction.</i></font>

14
00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:42.534
<font color=#80ffff><i>The Demolitions Committee
of Project Mayhem</i></font>

15
00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:45.996
<font color=#80ffff><i>wrapped the foundation columns
of a dozen buildings with blasting gelatin.</i></font>

16
00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:49.759
<font color=#80ffff><i>And a few square blocks will be reduced
to smouldering rubble.</i></font>

17
00:02:49.784 --> 00:02:52.767
<font color=#80ffff><i>And a few blocks will be reduced
to smouldering rubble.</i></font>

18
00:02:53.748 --> 00:02:54.683
<font color=#80ffff><i>I know this...</i></font>

19
00:02:54.973 --> 00:02:56.407
<font color=#80ffff><i>because Tyler knows this.</i></font>

20
00:02:57.004 --> 00:02:57.936
Two and a half.

21
00:02:58.347 --> 00:03:00.406
Think of everything we have accomplished.

22
00:03:00.448 --> 00:03:03.025
<font color=#80ffff><i>And suddenly I realize that all of this,</i></font>

23
00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.483
<font color=#80ffff><i>the gun, the bombs, the revolution,</i></font>

24
00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:09.070
<font color=#80ffff><i>has got something to do
with a girl named Marla Singer.</i></font>

25
00:03:11.365 --> 00:03:11.909
<font color=#80ffff><i>Bob.</i></font>

26
00:03:12.623 --> 00:03:13.876
<font color=#80ffff><i>Bob had bitch tits.</i></font>

27
00:03:14.596 --> 00:03:16.090
<font color=#80ffff><i>This was a support group,</i></font>

28
00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:18.010
<font color=#80ffff><i>for men with testicular cancer.</i></font>

29
00:03:18.747 --> 00:03:20.834
<font color=#80ffff><i>The big moosie slobbering all over me,</i></font>

30
00:03:20.858 --> 00:03:21.982
<font color=#80ffff><i>that was Bob.</i></font>

31
00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:23.722
We are still men.

32
00:03:24.352 --> 00:03:25.762
Yes, we are men.

33
00:03:26.194 --> 00:03:28.108
Men is what we are.

34
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.803
<font color=#80ffff><i>Eight months ago,
Bob's testicles were removed.</i></font>

35
00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:32.533
<font color=#80ffff><i>Then hormone therapy.</i></font>

36
00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:36.340
<font color=#80ffff><i>He developed bitch tits
because his testosterone was too high</i></font>

37
00:03:36.365 --> 00:03:37.832
<font color=#80ffff><i>and his body upped the oestrogen.</i></font>

38
00:03:38.225 --> 00:03:39.541
<font color=#80ffff><i>Then now that was where I fit.</i></font>

39
00:03:39.543 --> 00:03:42.549
I think they are gonna have to open up
my pecs again and drain the fluid.

40
00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:44.469
<font color=#80ffff><i>Between those huge, sweating tits</i></font>

41
00:03:44.494 --> 00:03:45.984
<font color=#80ffff><i>that hung enormous,</i></font>

42
00:03:46.008 --> 00:03:47.924
<font color=#80ffff><i>the way you would think of God's as big.</i></font>

43
00:03:48.112 --> 00:03:48.904
Ok.

44
00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:50.451
You cry now.

45
00:03:51.604 --> 00:03:53.017
<font color=#80ffff><i>No, wait. Back up.</i></font>

46
00:03:53.293 --> 00:03:54.390
<font color=#80ffff><i>Let me start earlier.</i></font>

47
00:03:55.244 --> 00:03:56.245
<font color=#80ffff><i>For six months,</i></font>

48
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.564
<font color=#80ffff><i>I couldn't sleep.</i></font>

49
00:03:57.677 --> 00:03:58.757
<font color=#80ffff><i>I couldn't sleep...</i></font>

50
00:03:58.797 --> 00:03:59.924

52
00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.090

53
00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.089
<font color=#80ffff><i>Everything is a copy,</i></font>

54
00:04:07.415 --> 00:04:08.201
<font color=#80ffff><i>of a copy,</i></font>

55
00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:09.479

<font color=#80ffff><i>The Planet Starbucks.</i></font>

61
00:04:25.508 --> 00:04:27.104
I need you out of town
a little more this week.

62
00:04:27.128 --> 00:04:28.469
We have got some red flags to cover.

63
00:04:28.522 --> 00:04:29.903
<font color=#80ffff><i>It must have been Tuesday.</i></font>

<font color=#80ffff><i>He was wearing his cornflower blue tie.</i></font>

65
00:04:32.162 --> 00:04:34.908
You want me to deprioritise my current reports,
Yep.

66
00:04:34.932 --> 00:04:36.863
Until you advise of a status upgrade?

67
00:04:36.888 --> 00:04:38.370
Make these your primary action items.

68
00:04:38.825 --> 00:04:39.788
Here is your flight coupons.

69
00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:41.259
Call me from the road if there is any snags.

70
00:04:41.438 --> 00:04:42.666

71
00:04:43.257 --> 00:04:45.347

<font color=#80ffff><i>to the Ikea nesting instinct.</i></font>

74
00:04:52.137 --> 00:04:53.552
<i>Good morning.</i>
Yes.

75
00:04:53.576 --> 00:04:56.557
I would like to order Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.

76
00:04:56.581 --> 00:04:57.349
<i>Please hold.</i>

00:04:57.422 --> 00:05:00.296

79
00:05:02.033 --> 00:05:03.269
<font color=#80ffff><i>I had to have it.</i></font>

85
00:05:18.592 --> 00:05:20.499
<font color=#80ffff><i>I'd flip through catalogues and wonder</i></font>

86
00:05:20.605 --> 00:05:23.599
<font color=#80ffff><i>What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?</i></font>

87
00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:25.959
<font color=#80ffff><i>I had it all.</i></font>

88
00:05:25.983 --> 00:05:29.208
<font color=#80ffff><i>Even the glass dishes

93
00:05:35.864 --> 00:05:36.887
I was holding.

94
00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:38.279
<i>Your call is important to us.</i>

95

<font color=#80ffff><i>Now it was the Horchow collection.</i></font>

97
00:05:42.392 --> 00:05:42.893
No.

98
00:05:43.172 --> 00:05:45.145
You can't die from insomnia.

99
00:05:45.235 --> 00:05:46.865
What about narcolepsy?

100
00:05:47.252 --> 00:05:51.412
I nod off, I wake up in strange places.
I have no idea how I got there.

101
00:05:51.578 --> 00:05:53.195
You need to lighten up.

102
00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:55.339
Can you please just give me something?

103
00:05:55.525 --> 00:05:56.949
<font color=#80ffff><i>Red and blue Tuinals,</i></font>

105
00:05:59.049 --> 00:05:59.701
No.

106
00:06:00.436 --> 00:06:02.339
You need healthy, natural sleep.

107
00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:06.708
Chew some valerian root
and get more exercise.

108
00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:10.754
Hey, come on.

109
00:06:10.778 --> 00:06:12.005
I am in pain.

110
00:06:12.268 --> 00:06:13.559
You wanna see pain?

111
00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:16.134
Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.

112
00:06:16.158 --> 00:06:18.439
See the guys with testicular cancer.

113
00:06:19.106 --> 00:06:20.093
That's pain.

114
00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:38.073
I always wanted three kids.

115
00:06:39.008 --> 00:06:40.262
Two boys and a girl.

116
00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:43.379
Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.

117
00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:45.880
We never could agree on anything.

118
00:06:47.906 --> 00:06:48.876
Well, she had...

119
00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:51.156
she had her first child last week...

120
00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:52.832
a girl.

121
00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:55.716
With her...

122
00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:57.173
with her new husband.

123
00:07:01.645 --> 00:07:02.893
And thank God. You know?

124
00:07:04.162 --> 00:07:05.602
I. I am glad for her.

125
00:07:07.378 --> 00:07:09.995
Bec... because she deserves it.

126
00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:17.250
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.

127
00:07:17.742 --> 00:07:19.157
Thank you, Thomas.

128
00:07:19.915 --> 00:07:22.957
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of courage.

129
00:07:23.404 --> 00:07:25.048
And that gives me strength.

130
00:07:25.588 --> 00:07:27.228
We give each other strength.

131
00:07:27.944 --> 00:07:29.484
It's time for the one on ones.

132
00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:32.762
So let's all of us follow
Thomas good example and...

133
00:07:33.007 --> 00:07:34.568
really open ourselves up.

134
00:07:35.212 --> 00:07:36.581
Could you find a partner?

135
00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:41.949
<font color=#80ffff><i>And this is how I met the big moosie.</i></font>

136
00:07:43.811 --> 00:07:46.256
<font color=#80ffff><i>His eyes already shrinkwrapped in tears.</i></font>

137
00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:50.812
<font color=#80ffff><i>Knees together.</i></font>

138
00:07:50.982 --> 00:07:52.567
<font color=#80ffff><i>Those awkward little steps.</i></font>

139
00:07:58.032 --> 00:07:59.798
My name is Bob.
Bob?

140
00:08:00.864 --> 00:08:02.931
<font color=#80ffff><i>Bob had been a champion body builder.</i></font>

141
00:08:03.324 --> 00:08:06.431
<font color=#80ffff><i>You know that chest expansion
program you see on late night TV?</i></font>

142
00:08:06.784 --> 00:08:08.154
<font color=#80ffff><i>That was his idea.</i></font>

143
00:08:08.386 --> 00:08:09.479
I was a juicer.

144
00:08:10.662 --> 00:08:12.752
You know, using steroids.

145
00:08:14.059 --> 00:08:15.504
Diabonal and...

146
00:08:16.931 --> 00:08:17.859
Wisterol.

147
00:08:18.752 --> 00:08:21.252
They use that on racehorses,
for Christ is sakes.

148
00:08:22.855 --> 00:08:23.679
And now I am...

149
00:08:24.349 --> 00:08:25.180
bankrupt...

150
00:08:25.784 --> 00:08:26.864
I am divorced,

151
00:08:28.569 --> 00:08:29.893
my two grown kids,

152
00:08:31.757 --> 00:08:33.686
won't even return my phone calls.

153
00:08:34.948 --> 00:08:38.513
<font color=#80ffff><i>Strangers with this kind of honesty
make me go a big, rubbery one.</i></font>

154
00:08:41.629 --> 00:08:42.531
Go ahead...

155
00:08:42.795 --> 00:08:43.624
Cornelius.

156
00:08:44.775 --> 00:08:45.815
You can cry.

157
00:09:00.939 --> 00:09:02.134
<font color=#80ffff><i>And then...</i></font>

158
00:09:02.158 --> 00:09:03.427
<font color=#80ffff><i>something happened.</i></font>

159
00:09:04.379 --> 00:09:06.012
<font color=#80ffff><i>I let go.</i></font>
That's really good.

160
00:09:07.039 --> 00:09:08.259
<font color=#80ffff><i>Lost in oblivion.</i></font>

161
00:09:09.249 --> 00:09:11.499
<font color=#80ffff><i>Dark and silent and complete.</i></font>

162
00:09:13.805 --> 00:09:15.029
<font color=#80ffff><i>I found freedom.</i></font>

163
00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:18.460
<font color=#80ffff><i>Losing all hope was freedom.</i></font>

164
00:09:20.329 --> 00:09:21.253
It's ok.

165
00:09:25.155 --> 00:09:26.835
<font color=#80ffff><i>Babies don't sleep this well.</i></font>

166
00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:32.875
<font color=#80ffff><i>I became addicted.</i></font>

167
00:09:46.855 --> 00:09:48.305
<font color=#80ffff><i>If I didn't say anything,</i></font>

168
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:51.289
<font color=#80ffff><i>people always assumed the worst.</i></font>

169
00:09:55.442 --> 00:09:56.669
<font color=#80ffff><i>They cried harder...</i></font>

170
00:09:57.699 --> 00:09:58.949
<font color=#80ffff><i>then I cried harder.</i></font>

171
00:10:07.669 --> 00:10:10.327
Now we are going to open the green door,

172
00:10:10.444 --> 00:10:11.972
the heart chakra...

173
00:10:12.139 --> 00:10:13.822
<font color=#80ffff><i>I was not really dying.</i></font>

174
00:10:14.469 --> 00:10:17.037
<font color=#80ffff><i>I was not host to cancer or parasites.</i></font>

175
00:10:18.181 --> 00:10:22.150
<font color=#80ffff><i>I was the warm little centre
that the life of this world crowded around.</i></font>

176
00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:24.174
Imagine your pain,

177
00:10:24.384 --> 00:10:26.705
as a white ball of healing light.

178
00:10:27.582 --> 00:10:30.662
It moves over your body, healing you.

179
00:10:31.379 --> 00:10:32.891
Now keep this going.

180
00:10:32.915 --> 00:10:34.169
Remember to breathe.

181
00:10:34.409 --> 00:10:37.699
And step forward
through the back door of the room.

182
00:10:38.699 --> 00:10:40.062
Where does it lead?

183
00:10:40.955 --> 00:10:42.585
To your cave.

184
00:10:43.169 --> 00:10:46.419
Step forward into your cave.

185
00:10:47.379 --> 00:10:48.839
That's right.

186
00:10:49.209 --> 00:10:52.509
<i>You are going deeper into your cave,</i>

187
00:10:53.049 --> 00:10:55.038
<i>and you are going to find...</i>

188
00:10:55.735 --> 00:10:57.575
<i>your power animal.</i>

189
00:11:00.099 --> 00:11:01.479
Slide.

190
00:11:12.445 --> 00:11:14.219
<font color=#80ffff><i>Every evening I died.</i></font>

191
00:11:15.582 --> 00:11:17.918
<font color=#80ffff><i>And every evening I was born again.</i></font>

192
00:11:18.739 --> 00:11:19.835
<font color=#80ffff><i>Resurrected.</i></font>

193
00:11:22.909 --> 00:11:26.422
<font color=#80ffff><i>Bob loved me because he thought
my testicles were removed too.</i></font>

194
00:11:27.079 --> 00:11:28.321
<font color=#80ffff><i>Being there,</i></font>

195
00:11:28.625 --> 00:11:30.282
<font color=#80ffff><i>pressed against his tits,</i></font>

196
00:11:30.439 --> 00:11:31.682
<font color=#80ffff><i>ready to cry.</i></font>

197
00:11:32.129 --> 00:11:33.859
<font color=#80ffff><i>This was my vacation.</i></font>

198
00:11:37.929 --> 00:11:39.040
<font color=#80ffff><i>And she...</i></font>

199
00:11:39.442 --> 00:11:41.599
<font color=#80ffff><i>ruined everything.</i></font>

200
00:11:41.679 --> 00:11:43.122
This is cancer, right?

201
00:11:46.939 --> 00:11:48.966
<font color=#80ffff><i>This chick, Marla Singer,</i></font>

202
00:11:48.991 --> 00:11:51.109
<font color=#80ffff><i>did not have testicular cancer.</i></font>

203
00:11:51.689 --> 00:11:53.066
<font color=#80ffff><i>She was a liar.</i></font>

204
00:11:53.439 --> 00:11:55.523
<font color=#80ffff><i>She had no diseases at all.</i></font>

205
00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:57.851
<font color=#80ffff><i>I had seen her at Free and Clear,</i></font>

206
00:11:57.875 --> 00:11:59.909
<font color=#80ffff><i>my blood parasites group, Thursdays.</i></font>

207
00:11:59.989 --> 00:12:01.021
<font color=#80ffff><i>Then at Hope,</i></font>

208
00:12:01.212 --> 00:12:03.286
<font color=#80ffff><i>my bimonthly sicklecell circle.</i></font>

209
00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:05.984
<font color=#80ffff><i>And again at Seize the Day,</i></font>

210
00:12:06.194 --> 00:12:08.015
<font color=#80ffff><i>my tuberculosis, Friday night.</i></font>

211
00:12:11.129 --> 00:12:12.157
<font color=#80ffff><i>Marla,</i></font>

212
00:12:12.589 --> 00:12:14.099
<font color=#80ffff><i>the big tourist.</i></font>

213
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:16.789
<font color=#80ffff><i>Her lie reflected my lie.</i></font>

214
00:12:17.129 --> 00:12:18.246
<font color=#80ffff><i>And suddenly,</i></font>

215
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.719
<font color=#80ffff><i>I felt nothing.</i></font>

216
00:12:19.799 --> 00:12:21.249
<font color=#80ffff><i>I couldn't cry.</i></font>

217
00:12:21.742 --> 00:12:23.168
<font color=#80ffff><i>So once again,</i></font>

218
00:12:23.418 --> 00:12:24.655
<font color=#80ffff><i>I couldn't sleep.</i></font>

219
00:12:36.819 --> 00:12:37.807
<font color=#80ffff><i>Next group,</i></font>

220
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:39.498
<font color=#80ffff><i>after guided meditation,</i></font>

221
00:12:39.804 --> 00:12:41.645
<font color=#80ffff><i>after we open our heart chakras,</i></font>

222
00:12:41.669 --> 00:12:42.917
<font color=#80ffff><i>when it's time to hug,</i></font>

223
00:12:43.017 --> 00:12:45.749
<font color=#80ffff><i>I'm gonna grab that bitch Marla Singer
and scream</i></font>

224
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:47.234
Marla, you liar!

225
00:12:47.258 --> 00:12:49.895
You big tourist! I need this! Now, get out!

226
00:12:51.709 --> 00:12:53.829
<font color=#80ffff><i>I hadn't slept in four days.</i></font>

227
00:12:56.085 --> 00:12:58.582
<font color=#80ffff><i>When you have insomnia,
you are never really asleep</i></font>

228
00:12:59.719 --> 00:13:01.441
<font color=#80ffff><i>and you are never really awake.</i></font>

229
00:13:04.269 --> 00:13:06.127
To begin tonight's communion,

230
00:13:06.151 --> 00:13:08.349
Chloe would like to say a few words.

231
00:13:09.479 --> 00:13:10.548
<font color=#80ffff><i>Oh, yeah.</i></font>

232
00:13:11.072 --> 00:13:11.842
<font color=#80ffff><i>Chloe.</i></font>

233
00:13:13.185 --> 00:13:15.507
<font color=#80ffff><i>Chloe looked the way
Meryl Streep is skeleton would look</i></font>

234
00:13:15.532 --> 00:13:19.245
<font color=#80ffff><i>if you made it smile and walk around
a party being extra nice to everybody.</i></font>

235
00:13:20.115 --> 00:13:21.572
Well, I am still here.

236
00:13:22.636 --> 00:13:24.482
But I don't know for how long.

237
00:13:25.652 --> 00:13:28.122
That's as much certainty
as anyone can give me.

238
00:13:29.415 --> 00:13:31.089
But I have got some good news.

239
00:13:32.038 --> 00:13:34.348
I no longer have any fear of death.

240
00:13:38.299 --> 00:13:38.994
But...

241
00:13:39.266 --> 00:13:42.012
I am in a pretty lonely place.

242
00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:45.406
No one will have sex with me.

243
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:47.870
I am so close to the end,

244
00:13:47.895 --> 00:13:50.205
and all I want is to get laid for
the last time.

245
00:13:51.903 --> 00:13:55.135
I have pornographic movies
in my apartment and...

246
00:13:55.232 --> 00:13:58.009
lubricants and amyl nitrite.
Thank you, Chloe.

247
00:13:58.989 --> 00:14:00.098
Everyone let's...

248
00:14:00.368 --> 00:14:01.355
thank Chloe.

249
00:14:02.009 --> 00:14:04.069
Thank you, Chloe.

250
00:14:06.289 --> 00:14:07.564
Now let's...

251
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.995
ready ourself for guided meditation.

252
00:14:12.249 --> 00:14:14.830
You are standing at the entrance
of your cave.

253
00:14:15.799 --> 00:14:19.009
You step inside your cave and you walk...

254
00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:20.827
<font color=#80ffff><i>if I did have a tumour,</i></font>

255
00:14:21.317 --> 00:14:22.777
<font color=#80ffff><i>I'd name it Marla.</i></font>

256
00:14:23.759 --> 00:14:24.688
<font color=#80ffff><i>Marla.</i></font>

257
00:14:25.261 --> 00:14:27.354
<font color=#80ffff><i>The little scratch on the roof
of your mouth</i></font>

258
00:14:27.379 --> 00:14:29.794
<font color=#80ffff><i>that would heal if you could stop
tonguing it,</i></font>

259
00:14:30.013 --> 00:14:30.897
<font color=#80ffff><i>but you can't.</i></font>

260
00:14:30.922 --> 00:14:34.302
Deeper into your cave as you walk.

261
00:14:35.968 --> 00:14:39.298
<i>You feel the healing energy of
this place all around you.</i>

262
00:14:41.029 --> 00:14:43.109
<i>Now find your power animal.</i>

263
00:14:47.492 --> 00:14:48.644
Slide.

264
00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:53.693
Ok.

265
00:14:53.969 --> 00:14:55.482
Let's partner up.

266
00:14:55.922 --> 00:14:58.249
Pick someone special to you tonight.

267
00:15:04.469 --> 00:15:05.264
Hey.

268
00:15:07.122 --> 00:15:09.042
We need to talk.
Sure.

269
00:15:14.189 --> 00:15:15.215
I am onto you.

270
00:15:15.487 --> 00:15:17.092
What?
Yeah.

271
00:15:17.116 --> 00:15:19.289
You are a faker. You are not dying.

272
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.899
Sorry?

273
00:15:20.924 --> 00:15:22.545
In the Tibetan philosophy,

274
00:15:22.569 --> 00:15:25.504
Sylvia Plath sense, I know we are all dying.

275
00:15:25.659 --> 00:15:28.052
Alright, but you are not dying
the way Chloe back there is dying.

276
00:15:29.489 --> 00:15:30.265
So?

277
00:15:31.249 --> 00:15:32.672
So you are a tourist.

278
00:15:33.459 --> 00:15:34.567
I have seen you.

279
00:15:34.591 --> 00:15:36.486
I saw you at melanoma,

280
00:15:36.789 --> 00:15:38.028
I saw you at tuberculosis.

281
00:15:38.053 --> 00:15:40.069
I saw you at testicular cancer!

282
00:15:40.094 --> 00:15:41.539
I saw you practising this.

283
00:15:42.349 --> 00:15:44.069
Practising what?
Telling me off.

284
00:15:44.545 --> 00:15:46.371
Is it going as well as you hoped...

285
00:15:46.921 --> 00:15:47.735
Rupert?

286
00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:49.833
I will expose you.

287
00:15:49.857 --> 00:15:51.540
Go ahead. I will expose you.

288
00:15:51.849 --> 00:15:54.995
Alright, come together.
Let yourselves cry.

289
00:16:02.859 --> 00:16:04.505
Oh, God. Why are you doing this?

290
00:16:04.764 --> 00:16:07.072
It's cheaper than a movie
and there is free coffee's.

291
00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:08.101
Look...

292
00:16:08.459 --> 00:16:10.103
this is important. Ok.

293
00:16:10.127 --> 00:16:11.132
These are my groups.

294
00:16:11.157 --> 00:16:13.011
I have been coming for over a year.

295
00:16:13.199 --> 00:16:14.357
Why do you do it?

296
00:16:15.207 --> 00:16:16.209
I don't know.

297
00:16:16.344 --> 00:16:20.184
When people think you are dying, then they
really really listen to you instead of just...

298
00:16:20.209 --> 00:16:22.622
Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.

299
00:16:24.502 --> 00:16:25.285
Yeah.

300
00:16:26.222 --> 00:16:26.956
Yeah.

301
00:16:27.772 --> 00:16:30.352
Share yourself, completely.

302
00:16:31.639 --> 00:16:34.465
Look, you don't want to get into this.
It becomes an addiction.

303
00:16:34.565 --> 00:16:35.420
Really?

304
00:16:36.138 --> 00:16:37.964
I am not kidding. I can't cry,

305
00:16:37.988 --> 00:16:40.149
if another faker is present,
and I need this.

306
00:16:40.229 --> 00:16:42.195
So you gotta find somewhere else to go.

307
00:16:43.092 --> 00:16:44.554
Candystripe a cancer ward.

308
00:16:44.578 --> 00:16:45.852
It's not my problem.

309
00:16:48.989 --> 00:16:50.018
Wait, wait, wait.

310
00:16:50.815 --> 00:16:52.015
Hold on. Hold on. I will tell you.

311
00:16:52.075 --> 00:16:53.730
We are gonna split up the week, ok?

312
00:16:53.754 --> 00:16:55.804
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.

313
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:58.499
You take tuberculosis.
My smoking doesn't go over at all.

314
00:16:58.579 --> 00:17:00.111
Ok. Good. Fine.

315
00:17:00.135 --> 00:17:02.255
Testicular cancer should be no contest, ok.

316
00:17:02.335 --> 00:17:04.991
Technically, I have more
right to be there than you.

317
00:17:05.015 --> 00:17:06.129
You still have your balls.

318
00:17:06.219 --> 00:17:07.827
You are kidding.
I don't know.

319
00:17:07.851 --> 00:17:08.589
Am I?

320
00:17:09.016 --> 00:17:10.129
No. No.

321
00:17:10.205 --> 00:17:11.581
What do you want?

322
00:17:11.956 --> 00:17:13.125
I will take the parasites.

323
00:17:13.509 --> 00:17:16.469
You can't have both the parasites, but
why don't you take the blood parasites.

324
00:17:16.496 --> 00:17:17.679
I want brain parasites.

325
00:17:17.769 --> 00:17:21.060
I will take the blood parasites, but
I am gonna take the organic brain dementia.

326
00:17:21.085 --> 00:17:22.008
I want that.

327
00:17:22.032 --> 00:17:23.608
You can't have the whole brain.

328
00:17:23.642 --> 00:17:24.719
So far, you have four.

329
00:17:24.743 --> 00:17:26.029
I only have two.

330
00:17:26.278 --> 00:17:26.804
Ok.

331
00:17:27.511 --> 00:17:29.865
Take both the parasites. they are yours.

332
00:17:30.319 --> 00:17:31.805
Now we both have three...

333
00:17:36.068 --> 00:17:38.069
Hey! You left half your clothes.

334
00:17:54.559 --> 00:17:56.584
What, are you selling those?
Yes,

335
00:17:56.608 --> 00:17:58.158
I am selling some clothes.

336
00:17:58.765 --> 00:17:59.462
So,

337
00:17:59.892 --> 00:18:00.957
we each have three. That's six.

338
00:18:00.982 --> 00:18:03.229
What about the seventh day?
I want ascending bowel cancer.

339
00:18:03.309 --> 00:18:05.309
<font color=#80ffff><i>The girl had done her homework.</i></font>

340
00:18:05.648 --> 00:18:06.844
No. No. I want...

341
00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:08.304
I want bowel cancer.

342
00:18:09.142 --> 00:18:10.502
That's your favourite too?

343
00:18:10.859 --> 00:18:12.517
Tried to slip it by me?

344
00:18:13.119 --> 00:18:14.489
Look, we are gonna split it. Ok?

345
00:18:14.869 --> 00:18:16.805
Take the first and third Sunday
of the month.

346
00:18:20.119 --> 00:18:20.926
Deal.

347
00:18:23.959 --> 00:18:25.363
Looks like this is goodbye.

348
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.880
Well, let's not make
a big thing out of it, ok.

349
00:18:27.935 --> 00:18:29.633
How is this for not making a big thing?

350
00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:35.915
Hey, Marla!

351
00:18:36.312 --> 00:18:37.245
Marla!

352
00:18:39.115 --> 00:18:40.877
Maybe we should exchange numbers.

353
00:18:41.432 --> 00:18:42.535
Should we?

354
00:18:42.599 --> 00:18:44.267
We might wanna switch nights.

355
00:18:46.218 --> 00:18:46.934
Ok.

356
00:18:52.659 --> 00:18:54.557
<font color=#80ffff><i>This is how I met Marla Singer.</i></font>

357
00:18:56.492 --> 00:18:59.991
<font color=#80ffff><i>Marla's philosophy of life
is that she might die at any moment.</i></font>

358
00:19:00.449 --> 00:19:01.941
<font color=#80ffff><i>The tragedy she said,</i></font>

359
00:19:01.965 --> 00:19:02.999
<font color=#80ffff><i>was that she didn't.</i></font>

360
00:19:03.134 --> 00:19:05.288
It doesn't have your name!
Who are you?

361
00:19:05.588 --> 00:19:06.779
Cornelius?

362
00:19:06.803 --> 00:19:07.780
Rupert?

363
00:19:07.804 --> 00:19:08.582
Travis?

364
00:19:08.879 --> 00:19:11.213
Any of the stupid names
you give each night?

365
00:19:14.792 --> 00:19:16.433
<font color=#80ffff><i>You wake up at SeaTac.</i></font>

373
00:19:30.384 --> 00:19:33.420
Check in for that flight
doesn't begin for another two hours, sir.

374
00:19:33.605 --> 00:19:34.557
<font color=#80ffff><i>This is your life,</i></font>

376
00:19:37.919 --> 00:19:40.024
<font color=#80ffff><i>You wake up at Air Harbour International.</i></font>

377

379
00:19:45.789 --> 00:19:47.885
<font color=#80ffff><i>could you wake up as a different person?</i></font>

380
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:51.115
<font color=#80ffff><i>Everywhere I travel,</i></font>

381

390
00:20:10.733 --> 00:20:12.365
<font color=#80ffff><i>they're single serving friends.</i></font>

391
00:20:13.785 --> 00:20:16.391
<font color=#80ffff><i>Between take off and landing,
we have our time together,</i></font>

392
00:20:16.594 --> 00:20:17.785
<font color=#80ffff><i>but that's all we get.</i></font>

393
00:20:19.199 --> 00:20:20.449
<i>Welcome!</i>

394
00:20:22.619 --> 00:20:23.962
<font color=#80ffff><i>On a long enough time line,</i></font>

395
00:20:23.987 --> 00:20:26.622
<font color=#80ffff><i>the survival rate for

396
00:20:27.362 --> 00:20:28.820
<font color=#80ffff><i>I was a recall coordinator.</i></font>

397
00:20:28.882 --> 00:20:30.919
<font color=#80ffff><i>My job was to apply the formula.</i></font>

398
00:20:31.141 --> 00:20:34.377
The infant went through the windshield.
Three points.

399
00:20:34.402 --> 00:20:38.142
<font color=#80ffff><i>A new car built by my company

<font color=#80ffff><i>The rear differential locks up.</i></font>

401
00:20:40.719 --> 00:20:43.599
The teenager's braces
are wrapped around the backseat ashtray.

402
00:20:43.679 --> 00:20:45.889
Might make a good antismoking ad.

403
00:20:45.979 --> 00:20:48.849
<font color=#80ffff><i>The car crashes and burns
with everyone trapped inside.</i></font>

404
00:20:48.939 --> 00:20:49.696
<font color=#80ffff><i>Now,</i></font>

405
00:20:49.914 --> 00:20:51.554
<i>should we initiate a recall?</i>

406
00:20:51.801 --> 00:20:53.216
The father must have been huge.

407
00:20:53.241 --> 00:20:56.412
See where the fat is burned to the seat?
The polyester shirt?

408
00:20:57.082 --> 00:20:58.782
Very modern art.

409
00:20:59.178 --> 00:21:01.754
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Take the number of vehicles in the field. A.</i></font>

410
00:21:01.779 --> 00:21:04.665
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Multiply it by the probable rate of failure. B.</i></font>

411
00:21:04.765 --> 00:21:08.152
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Then multiply the result by
the average outofcourt settlement. C.</i></font>

412
00:21:08.329 --> 00:21:10.854
<font color="#80ffff"><i>A x B x C...</i></font>

413
00:21:10.879 --> 00:21:12.041
equals X.

414
00:21:12.647 --> 00:21:13.531
If X,

415
00:21:13.555 --> 00:21:15.509
is less than the cost of a recall,

416
00:21:15.925 --> 00:21:17.191
we don't do one.

417
00:21:18.299 --> 00:21:20.885
Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?

418
00:21:21.096 --> 00:21:22.572
You would not believe.

419
00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:26.632
Which car company do you work for?

420
00:21:27.979 --> 00:21:29.349
A major one.

421
00:21:32.019 --> 00:21:35.479
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Every time the plane banked too sharply
on take off or landing,</i></font>

422
00:21:35.569 --> 00:21:37.221

423

<font color="#80ffff"><i>or a midair collision.</i></font>

424
00:21:39.149 --> 00:21:40.269
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Anything.</i></font>

425
00:21:50.209 --> 00:21:53.429
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Life insurance pays off triple
if you die on a business trip.</i></font>

426
00:21:56.822 --> 00:21:59.202
If you are seated
in an emergency exit row,

427
00:21:59.429 --> 00:22:00.202
you know,

428
00:22:01.009 --> 00:22:05.262
and feel you would be unable or unwilling
to perform the duties listed on the safety card,

429
00:22:05.849 --> 00:22:08.462
please ask a flight attendant
to reseat you.

430
00:22:10.139 --> 00:22:11.839
It's a lot of responsibility.

431
00:22:13.108 --> 00:22:14.359
You want switch seats?

432
00:22:14.439 --> 00:22:17.405
No. I am not sure
I am the man for that particular job.

433
00:22:18.176 --> 00:22:20.452
An exit door procedure at 30,000 feet.

434
00:22:22.739 --> 00:22:24.210
The illusion of safety.

435
00:22:25.206 --> 00:22:26.866
Yeah. I guess so.

436
00:22:27.619 --> 00:22:29.937
You know why
they put oxygen masks on planes?

437
00:22:30.539 --> 00:22:31.818
So you can breathe.

438
00:22:32.461 --> 00:22:34.485
Oxygen gets you high.

439
00:22:35.599 --> 00:22:39.069
In a catastrophic emergency,
you are taking giant panic breaths.

440
00:22:39.259 --> 00:22:40.952
Suddenly you become euphoric,

441
00:22:41.096 --> 00:22:41.953
docile.

442
00:22:42.057 --> 00:22:43.288
You accept your fate.

443
00:22:44.599 --> 00:22:45.898
It's alright here.

444
00:22:47.498 --> 00:22:50.018
Emergency water landing, 600mph.

445
00:22:50.191 --> 00:22:52.791
Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.

446
00:22:53.599 --> 00:22:54.738
That's...

447
00:22:56.448 --> 00:22:58.085
That's an interesting theory.

448
00:23:00.899 --> 00:23:01.848
What do you do?

449
00:23:02.198 --> 00:23:03.125
What do you mean?

450
00:23:03.529 --> 00:23:04.949
What do you do for a living?

451
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.768
Why?

452
00:23:06.479 --> 00:23:08.155
So you can pretend like you are interested?

453
00:23:11.662 --> 00:23:12.249
Ok.

454
00:23:12.369 --> 00:23:14.753
You have a kind of sick desperation
in your laugh.

455
00:23:18.669 --> 00:23:20.501
We have the exact same briefcase.

456
00:23:22.219 --> 00:23:23.001
Soap.

457
00:23:23.588 --> 00:23:24.245
Sorry?

458
00:23:24.707 --> 00:23:26.661
I make and I sell soap.

459
00:23:27.687 --> 00:23:29.293
The yardstick of civilization.

460
00:23:30.513 --> 00:23:31.980
<font color=#80ffff><i>And this is how I met...</i></font>

461
00:23:32.398 --> 00:23:33.447
Tyler Durden.

462
00:23:34.229 --> 00:23:36.254
Did you know if you mixed equal parts of gasoline

463
00:23:36.279 --> 00:23:38.713
and frozen orange juice concentrate,
you can make napalm?

464
00:23:39.649 --> 00:23:42.319
No, I did not know that. Is that true?
That's right.

465
00:23:42.399 --> 00:23:45.859
One can make all kinds of explosives
using simple household items.

466
00:23:46.069 --> 00:23:46.893
Really?

467
00:23:46.917 --> 00:23:48.362
If one were so inclined.

468
00:23:53.829 --> 00:23:55.318
Tyler, you are by far...

469
00:23:55.468 --> 00:23:58.395
the most interesting single serving friend
I have ever met.

470
00:24:00.379 --> 00:24:01.324
See everything,

471
00:24:01.348 --> 00:24:03.047
everything on a plane is single serving.

472
00:24:03.211 --> 00:24:04.759
I get it. It's very clever.

473
00:24:05.219 --> 00:24:06.132
Thank you.

474
00:24:07.589 --> 00:24:08.875
How is that working out for you?

475
00:24:09.422 --> 00:24:11.172
What?
Being clever.

476
00:24:12.809 --> 00:24:13.635
Great.

477
00:24:14.749 --> 00:24:15.546
Keep it up, then.

478
00:24:16.234 --> 00:24:17.342
Keep it right up.

479
00:24:19.317 --> 00:24:20.357
Now, a question of etiquette.

480
00:24:20.382 --> 00:24:22.812
As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?

481
00:24:30.724 --> 00:24:32.820
<font color=#80ffff><i>How I came to live with Tyler is...</i></font>

482
00:24:33.246 --> 00:24:36.692
<font color=#80ffff><i>Airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage.</i></font>

483
00:24:44.719 --> 00:24:46.219
Was it ticking?

484
00:24:46.299 --> 00:24:49.589
Actually, throwers don't worry about
ticking because modern bombs don't tick.

485
00:24:49.679 --> 00:24:51.040
Sorry. Throwers?

486
00:24:51.264 --> 00:24:52.509
Baggage handlers.

487
00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:55.628
But when a suitcase vibrates,

488
00:24:56.092 --> 00:24:57.706
then the throwers got to call the police.

489
00:24:57.965 --> 00:24:59.173
My suitcase...

490
00:24:59.864 --> 00:25:00.740
was vibrating?

491
00:25:00.765 --> 00:25:03.219
Nine times out of ten
it's an electric razor, but...

492
00:25:04.505 --> 00:25:05.992
every once in a while...

493
00:25:08.909 --> 00:25:10.085
it's a dildo.

494
00:25:11.805 --> 00:25:14.078
Of course it's company policy never to...

495
00:25:14.185 --> 00:25:16.094
imply ownership in the event of a dildo.

496
00:25:16.119 --> 00:25:17.817
We have to use the indefinite article,

497
00:25:17.841 --> 00:25:19.193
a dildo never...

498
00:25:20.141 --> 00:25:21.841
your dildo.

499
00:25:21.955 --> 00:25:23.467
I don't own...

500
00:25:26.907 --> 00:25:28.828
<font color=#80ffff><i>I had everything in that suitcase.</i></font>

501
00:25:29.071 --> 00:25:30.371
<font color=#80ffff><i>My CK shirts.</i></font>

502
00:25:30.568 --> 00:25:32.039
<font color=#80ffff><i>My DKNY shoes.</i></font>

503
00:25:32.395 --> 00:25:33.808
<font color=#80ffff><i>My AX ties.</i></font>

504
00:25:35.179 --> 00:25:36.179
<font color=#80ffff><i>Never mind.</i></font>

505
00:25:38.809 --> 00:25:41.439
Hey! That's my car!

506
00:25:48.615 --> 00:25:51.628
<font color=#80ffff><i>Home was a condo on
the 15th floor of a filing cabinet</i></font>

507
00:25:51.715 --> 00:25:53.508
<font color=#80ffff><i>for widows and young professionals.</i></font>

508
00:25:53.829 --> 00:25:55.829
<font color=#80ffff><i>The walls were solid concrete.</i></font>

509
00:25:56.069 --> 00:25:57.648
<font color=#80ffff><i>A foot of concrete is important,</i></font>

510
00:25:57.672 --> 00:25:59.652
<font color=#80ffff><i>when your next door neighbour
lets her hearing aid go</i></font>

511
00:25:59.677 --> 00:26:02.029
<font color=#80ffff><i>and has to watch game shows
at full volume.</i></font>

512
00:26:02.209 --> 00:26:04.238
<font color=#80ffff><i>Or when a volcanic blast </i></font>

513
00:26:04.262 --> 00:26:06.841
<font color=#80ffff><i>and debris that used to be
your furniture and personal effects </i></font>

514
00:26:06.888 --> 00:26:10.379
<font color=#80ffff><i>blows out of your floor to ceiling windows
and sails flaming into the night.</i></font>

515
00:26:16.996 --> 00:26:18.916
<font color=#80ffff><i>I suppose these things happen.</i></font>

516
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:34.035
There is nothing up there.

517
00:26:34.239 --> 00:26:36.353
You can't go into the unit.

518
00:26:36.423 --> 00:26:37.535
Police orders.

519
00:26:46.568 --> 00:26:48.429
Do you have somebody you can call?

520
00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:51.160
<font color=#80ffff><i>How embarrassing.</i></font>

521
00:26:51.644 --> 00:26:54.030
<font color=#80ffff><i>A houseful of
condiments and no food.</i></font>

522
00:27:04.229 --> 00:27:07.281
<font color=#80ffff><i>The police would later tell me that
the pilot light might have gone out,</i></font>

523
00:27:08.302 --> 00:27:10.282
<font color=#80ffff><i>letting out just a little bit of gas.</i></font>

524
00:27:11.262 --> 00:27:13.609
<font color=#80ffff><i>That gas could have
slowly filled the condo,</i></font>

525
00:27:13.879 --> 00:27:16.414
<font color=#80ffff><i>1700 square feet with high ceilings,</i></font>

526
00:27:16.439 --> 00:27:17.592
<font color=#80ffff><i>for days and days.</i></font>

527
00:27:25.553 --> 00:27:28.247
<font color=#80ffff><i>Then the refrigerator's compressor
could have clicked on.</i></font>

528
00:27:31.262 --> 00:27:31.985
<i>Yeah?</i>

529
00:27:35.219 --> 00:27:36.871
<i>I can hear you breathing, you...</i>

530
00:27:47.462 --> 00:27:50.225
<i>if you ask me now,
I couldn't tell you why I called him.</i>

531
00:28:33.399 --> 00:28:34.346
Hello?

532
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:35.492
<i>Who is this?</i>

533
00:28:37.359 --> 00:28:38.142
Tyler?

534
00:28:39.478 --> 00:28:40.379
<i>Who is this?</i>

535
00:28:41.799 --> 00:28:43.265
We met... We met on the airplane.

536
00:28:44.096 --> 00:28:45.385
We had the same suitcase.

537
00:28:46.699 --> 00:28:48.152
The... the clever guy.

538
00:28:49.772 --> 00:28:50.776
<i>Oh, yeah. Right.</i>

539
00:28:52.251 --> 00:28:54.325
<i>Ok.</i>
I called a second ago.

540
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.760
There was no answer. I am at a payphone.

541
00:28:56.785 --> 00:28:59.111
<i>Yeah, I star 69 you.
I never pick up my phone.</i>

542
00:29:02.139 --> 00:29:03.125
<i>So what is up?</i>

543
00:29:05.272 --> 00:29:05.938
Well...

544
00:29:07.365 --> 00:29:08.678
You are not gonna believe this.

545
00:29:11.899 --> 00:29:13.519
You know man, it could be worse.

546
00:29:13.829 --> 00:29:15.930
A woman could cut off
your penis while you sleeping,

547
00:29:15.954 --> 00:29:17.855
and toss it out the window of a moving car.

548
00:29:18.815 --> 00:29:19.949
There is always that.

549
00:29:20.819 --> 00:29:21.810
And now it's just...

550
00:29:21.878 --> 00:29:23.905
when you buy furniture,
you tell yourself

551
00:29:23.982 --> 00:29:26.339
That's it. That's the last sofa
I will gonna need.

552
00:29:26.425 --> 00:29:27.608
Whatever else happens,

553
00:29:27.918 --> 00:29:29.718
I have got that sofa problem handled.

554
00:29:30.129 --> 00:29:33.495
I had it all.
I had a stereo that was very decent.

555
00:29:33.549 --> 00:29:36.089
A wardrobe that was
getting very respectable.

556
00:29:36.502 --> 00:29:37.534
I was close...

557
00:29:37.695 --> 00:29:38.984
to being complete.

558
00:29:39.009 --> 00:29:40.746
Shit man, and now it's all gone.

559
00:29:41.036 --> 00:29:42.355
All gone.

560
00:29:43.108 --> 00:29:44.115
All gone.

561
00:29:46.615 --> 00:29:48.088
Do you know what a duvet is?

562
00:29:49.139 --> 00:29:50.089
It's a comforter.

563
00:29:50.113 --> 00:29:52.359
It's a blanket. Just a blanket.

564
00:29:52.744 --> 00:29:55.164
Why do guys like us
know what a duvet is?

565
00:29:55.249 --> 00:29:57.388
Is this essential to our survival,

566
00:29:57.412 --> 00:29:59.359
in the hunter-gatherer sense of the word?

567
00:29:59.609 --> 00:30:00.482
No.

568
00:30:01.535 --> 00:30:02.476
What are we, then?

569
00:30:03.361 --> 00:30:04.478
I don't know.

570
00:30:04.502 --> 00:30:05.705
Consumers.

571
00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:06.894
Right.

572
00:30:07.247 --> 00:30:09.900
We are consumers.
We are by products of a...

573
00:30:09.924 --> 00:30:11.317
lifestyle obsession.

574
00:30:12.204 --> 00:30:15.330
Murder, crime, poverty.
These things don't concern me.

575
00:30:15.468 --> 00:30:16.865
What concerns me,

576
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:18.798
are celebrity magazines,

577
00:30:18.879 --> 00:30:21.368
television with 500 channels,

578
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.073
some guy's name on my underwear.

579
00:30:23.253 --> 00:30:24.790
Rogaine. Viagra.

580
00:30:24.973 --> 00:30:25.879
Olestra.

581
00:30:25.918 --> 00:30:27.042
Martha Stewart.

582
00:30:27.191 --> 00:30:28.386
Fuck Martha Stewart.

583
00:30:28.889 --> 00:30:31.088
Martha's polishing
the brass on the Titanic.

584
00:30:31.112 --> 00:30:32.439
It's all going down, man.

585
00:30:32.778 --> 00:30:34.258
So fuck off with your...

586
00:30:34.378 --> 00:30:36.729
sofa units and Strinne green stripe patterns.

587
00:30:37.152 --> 00:30:39.452
I say never be complete.

588
00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:41.368
I say stop being perfect.

589
00:30:41.992 --> 00:30:44.032
I say let's... let's evolve.

590
00:30:44.218 --> 00:30:45.772
Let the chips fall where they may.

591
00:30:48.579 --> 00:30:50.858
But that's me, and I could be wrong.

592
00:30:50.882 --> 00:30:52.499
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.

593
00:30:52.579 --> 00:30:53.986
It's just stuff.

594
00:30:54.445 --> 00:30:55.987
It's not a tragedy.
Well,

595
00:30:56.074 --> 00:30:59.007
you did lose a lot of versatile solutions
for modern living.

596
00:30:59.575 --> 00:31:01.754
Fuck, you are right. No, I don't smoke.

597
00:31:05.599 --> 00:31:08.426
My insurance is probably
gonna cover it, so...

598
00:31:12.382 --> 00:31:13.182
What?

599
00:31:14.598 --> 00:31:15.632
The things you own,

600
00:31:15.829 --> 00:31:17.122
end up owning you.

601
00:31:19.979 --> 00:31:21.161
But do what you like, man.

602
00:31:24.678 --> 00:31:25.472
It's late.

603
00:31:26.484 --> 00:31:28.178
Hey, thanks for the beer.
Yeah, man.

604
00:31:29.159 --> 00:31:30.565
I should find a hotel.

605
00:31:32.188 --> 00:31:33.068
What?

606
00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:34.561
What?

607
00:31:35.112 --> 00:31:36.652
A hotel?
Yeah.

608
00:31:36.944 --> 00:31:37.905
Just ask, man.

609
00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.126
What are you talking about?

610
00:31:40.151 --> 00:31:40.991
Oh, God.

611
00:31:41.388 --> 00:31:43.364
Three pitchers of beer
and you still can't ask.

612
00:31:46.469 --> 00:31:47.122
What?

613
00:31:47.146 --> 00:31:49.162
You called me because
you need a place to stay.

614
00:31:49.682 --> 00:31:51.710
Oh, hey. No, no, no.
Yes, you did.

615
00:31:52.022 --> 00:31:53.019
So just ask.

616
00:31:53.262 --> 00:31:55.088
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.

617
00:31:57.454 --> 00:31:59.101
Would... Would that be a problem?

618
00:31:59.842 --> 00:32:01.341
Is it a problem for you to ask?

619
00:32:02.972 --> 00:32:05.168
Can I stay at your place?
Yeah.

620
00:32:06.989 --> 00:32:07.969
Thanks.

621
00:32:12.699 --> 00:32:14.108
I want you to do me a favour.

622
00:32:14.357 --> 00:32:15.247
Yeah, sure.

623
00:32:15.975 --> 00:32:17.573
I want you to hit me
as hard as you can.

624
00:32:19.222 --> 00:32:19.947
What?

625
00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.947
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

626
00:32:24.747 --> 00:32:26.966
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Let me tell you a little bit
about Tyler Durden.</i></font>

627
00:32:28.009 --> 00:32:29.498
Tyler was a night person.

628
00:32:29.815 --> 00:32:31.822
While the rest of us were sleeping,
he worked.

629
00:32:32.099 --> 00:32:34.458
He had one part-time job
as a projectionist.

630
00:32:35.019 --> 00:32:37.464
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.

631
00:32:37.488 --> 00:32:38.519
It comes on a few.

632
00:32:38.775 --> 00:32:41.135
So someone has to be there to switch
the projectors,

633
00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:44.442
at the exact moment that one
reel ends and the next one begins.

634
00:32:44.649 --> 00:32:46.723
If you look for them,
you can see little dots,

635
00:32:46.754 --> 00:32:49.016
come into the upper right corner
of the screen.

636
00:32:49.882 --> 00:32:51.520
In the industry we call them,

637
00:32:51.544 --> 00:32:52.529
cigarette burns.

638
00:32:52.912 --> 00:32:54.432
That's the cue for a changeover.

639
00:32:54.612 --> 00:32:55.816
He flips the projectors,

640
00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.316
movie keeps right on going and
nobody in the audience has any idea.

641
00:32:59.705 --> 00:33:01.962
Why would anyone want this shit job?

642
00:33:02.129 --> 00:33:04.856
Because it affords him other
interesting opportunities.

643
00:33:05.129 --> 00:33:08.002
Like splicing a frame of pornography
into family films.

644
00:33:08.282 --> 00:33:10.880
So when the snooty cat
and the courageous dog

645
00:33:10.905 --> 00:33:14.133
with the celebrity voices meet
for the first time in reel three,

646
00:33:14.212 --> 00:33:17.633
that's when you will catch a flash
of Tyler's contribution to the film.

647
00:33:25.239 --> 00:33:27.423
Nobody knows
that they saw it but they did.

648
00:33:27.702 --> 00:33:29.562
Nice big cock.

649
00:33:34.739 --> 00:33:37.409
Even a humming bird
couldn't catch Tyler at work.

650
00:33:42.972 --> 00:33:47.722
Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet
waiter at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.

651
00:33:52.939 --> 00:33:56.205
He was the guerrilla terrorist
of the food service industry.

652
00:33:57.112 --> 00:33:59.164
Do not watch.
I cannot go when you watch.

653
00:33:59.339 --> 00:34:01.200
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,

654
00:34:01.394 --> 00:34:02.633
he farted on meringues,

655
00:34:02.657 --> 00:34:04.029
sneezed on braised endives...

656
00:34:04.054 --> 00:34:06.167
As for the cream of mushroom soup, well...

657
00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:07.888
Go ahead, tell them.

658
00:34:09.107 --> 00:34:10.386
You get the idea.

659
00:34:10.559 --> 00:34:12.178
What do you want me to do?
You just want me to hit you?

660
00:34:12.232 --> 00:34:13.692
Come on. Do me this one favour.

661
00:34:13.953 --> 00:34:14.599
Why?

662
00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:17.178
Why? I don't know why. I don't know.
Never been in a fight. You?

663
00:34:17.203 --> 00:34:18.772
No. But that's a good thing.

664
00:34:18.798 --> 00:34:21.505
No it is not. How much can you know about
yourself if you have never been in a fight?

665
00:34:21.709 --> 00:34:23.571
I don't wanna die without any scars.

666
00:34:24.111 --> 00:34:25.781
Come on. Hit me before I lose my nerve.

667
00:34:26.324 --> 00:34:28.432
Oh, God. This is crazy.

668
00:34:28.457 --> 00:34:30.064
So go crazy! Let her rip.

669
00:34:30.552 --> 00:34:31.870
I don't know about this.

670
00:34:32.785 --> 00:34:33.805
I don't either.

671
00:34:33.838 --> 00:34:35.249
Who gives a shit? No one's watching.

672
00:34:35.273 --> 00:34:36.198
What do you care?

673
00:34:36.223 --> 00:34:38.553
Hey, this is crazy.
You want me to hit you?

674
00:34:39.059 --> 00:34:40.176
That's right.

675
00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:42.798
Where? Like, in the face?

676
00:34:43.735 --> 00:34:44.588
Surprise me.

677
00:34:46.569 --> 00:34:48.609
This is so fucking stupid.

678
00:34:59.289 --> 00:35:01.065
Motherfucker!

679
00:35:02.769 --> 00:35:04.037
You hit me in the ear!

680
00:35:04.062 --> 00:35:06.196
Well, Jesus, I am sorry.

681
00:35:06.589 --> 00:35:07.474
Christ!

682
00:35:07.499 --> 00:35:09.024
Why the ear, man?

683
00:35:09.049 --> 00:35:10.158
I fucked it up.

684
00:35:10.182 --> 00:35:11.522
No, that was perfect.

685
00:35:24.019 --> 00:35:25.512
No, it's alright.

686
00:35:27.399 --> 00:35:28.785
It really hurts.

687
00:35:29.529 --> 00:35:30.485
Right.

688
00:35:31.949 --> 00:35:33.098
Hit me again.

689
00:35:34.875 --> 00:35:36.548
No, you hit me. Come on!

690
00:35:53.259 --> 00:35:55.299
We should do this again sometime.

691
00:36:08.712 --> 00:36:10.345
Where is your car?
What car?

692
00:36:21.879 --> 00:36:24.107
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I don't know how
Tyler found that house,</i></font>

693
00:36:24.131 --> 00:36:25.999
<font color="#80ffff"><i>but he said he'd
been there for a year.</i></font>

694
00:36:26.212 --> 00:36:28.585
<font color="#80ffff"><i>It looked like it was
waiting to be torn down.</i></font>

<font color="#80ffff"><i>I didn't know if he owned it
or if he was squatting.</i></font>

700
00:36:42.312 --> 00:36:43.838
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Neither would have surprised me.</i></font>

701
00:36:45.019 --> 00:36:45.796
Yep.

702
00:36:46.213 --> 00:36:46.992
That's you.

703
00:36:47.645 --> 00:36:48.548
That's me.

704
00:36:48.792 --> 00:36:50.167
That's the toilet. Good?

705
00:36:50.192 --> 00:36:51.305
Yeah, thanks.

706
00:36:52.905 --> 00:36:54.252
<font color="#80ffff"><i>What a shithole.</i></font>

707
00:36:55.748 --> 00:36:56.959
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Nothing worked.</i></font>

708
00:37:00.372 --> 00:37:03.292
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Turning on one light meant

710
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:07.575
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Just some warehouses
and a paper mill.</i></font>

711
00:37:07.685 --> 00:37:11.482
<font color="#80ffff"><i>That fart smell of steam.
The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.</i></font>

712
00:37:13.419 --> 00:37:15.419
Hey. What have we here?

713
00:37:30.689 --> 00:37:32.209
Hey, guys.
Hey.

714
00:37:44.429 --> 00:37:46.982
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Every time it rained,
we had to kill the power.</i></font>

715
00:37:47.998 --> 00:37:50.435
<font color="#80ffff"><i>By the end of the first month,
I didn't miss TV.</i></font>

716
00:37:52.249 --> 00:37:54.991
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I didn't even mind the warm,
stale refrigerator.</i></font>

717
00:38:08.679 --> 00:38:09.744
Can I be next?

718
00:38:14.689 --> 00:38:15.642
Alright, man.

719
00:38:16.519 --> 00:38:17.569
Lose the tie.

720
00:38:22.682 --> 00:38:26.375
<font color="#80ffff"><i>At night, Tyler and I were alone
for half a mile in every direction.</i></font>

726
00:38:46.231 --> 00:38:47.501
Hey man, what are you reading?

727
00:38:47.525 --> 00:38:48.531
Listen to this.

728
00:38:48.578 --> 00:38:51.751
It's an article written
by an organ in the first person.

729
00:38:52.078 --> 00:38:54.309
I am Jack's Medulla Oblongata.

730
00:38:54.399 --> 00:38:56.532
Without me, Jack could not regulate

731
00:38:56.557 --> 00:38:58.679
his heart rate,
blood pressure or breathing.

732
00:38:58.939 --> 00:39:01.069
There is a whole series of these.

733
00:39:01.329 --> 00:39:02.974
I am Jill's Nipples.

734
00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:05.775
I am Jack's Colon.

735
00:39:05.802 --> 00:39:08.382
Yeah. I get cancer. I kill Jack.

736
00:39:12.136 --> 00:39:16.008
<font color="#80ffff"><i>After fighting, everything else in
your life got the volume turned down.</i></font>

737
00:39:18.975 --> 00:39:19.797
What?

738
00:39:19.822 --> 00:39:21.368
<font color="#80ffff"><i>You could deal with anything.</i></font>

739
00:39:21.392 --> 00:39:23.422
Have you finished those reports?

740
00:39:28.259 --> 00:39:30.099
If you could fight anyone,
who would you fight?

741
00:39:31.232 --> 00:39:32.579
I would fight my boss, probably.

742
00:39:33.099 --> 00:39:34.025
Really?

743
00:39:35.269 --> 00:39:36.842
Yeah. Why? Who would you fight?

744
00:39:37.061 --> 00:39:38.127
I would fight my dad.

745
00:39:38.939 --> 00:39:40.267
I don't know my dad.

746
00:39:40.867 --> 00:39:42.013
I mean, I know him but...

747
00:39:42.594 --> 00:39:44.707
he left when I was like six years old.

748
00:39:44.747 --> 00:39:47.069
Married this other woman
and had some other kids.

749
00:39:47.458 --> 00:39:49.328
He like did this every six years.

750
00:39:49.412 --> 00:39:51.481
He moves city and starts a new family.

751
00:39:51.637 --> 00:39:53.117
Fucker is setting up franchises.

752
00:39:55.817 --> 00:39:57.320
My dad never went to college,

753
00:39:57.483 --> 00:39:59.336
so it was real important that I go.

754
00:39:59.629 --> 00:40:01.049
That sounds familiar.

755
00:40:01.256 --> 00:40:02.284
So I graduate.

756
00:40:02.308 --> 00:40:04.743
I call him up long distance
and say Dad, now what?

757
00:40:05.049 --> 00:40:06.288
He says, get a job.

758
00:40:06.878 --> 00:40:08.582
Same here.
Now I am 25.

759
00:40:08.606 --> 00:40:10.049
Make my yearly call again.

760
00:40:10.612 --> 00:40:12.052
Dad, now what?

761
00:40:12.278 --> 00:40:13.461
He says, I don't know.

762
00:40:13.745 --> 00:40:14.878
Get married.

763
00:40:16.769 --> 00:40:18.058
You can't get married.

764
00:40:19.149 --> 00:40:20.718
I am a 30-year-old boy.

765
00:40:21.291 --> 00:40:23.644
We are a generation of men
raised by women.

766
00:40:24.359 --> 00:40:27.784
I am wondering if another woman
is really the answer we need.

767
00:40:33.959 --> 00:40:36.335
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Most of the week,
we were Ozzie and Harriet.</i></font>

768
00:40:38.625 --> 00:40:40.238
<font color="#80ffff"><i>But every Saturday night,</i></font>

769
00:40:40.615 --> 00:40:42.238
<font color="#80ffff"><i>we were finding something out.</i></font>

770
00:40:42.959 --> 00:40:46.152
<font color="#80ffff"><i>We were finding out more and more
that we were not alone.</i></font>

771
00:40:50.555 --> 00:40:53.126
<font color="#80ffff"><i>It used to be that when
I came home angry or depressed,</i></font>

772
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:54.608
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I should just clean my condo.</i></font>

773
00:40:54.721 --> 00:40:56.808
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Polish my Scandinavian furniture.</i></font>

774
00:40:57.435 --> 00:40:59.315
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I should have been
looking for a new condo.</i></font>

775
00:40:59.689 --> 00:41:02.109
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I should have been haggling
with my insurance company.</i></font>

776
00:41:02.359 --> 00:41:05.764
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I should have been upset about
my nice, neat, flaming little shit,</i></font>

777
00:41:06.103 --> 00:41:07.464
<font color="#80ffff"><i>but I was not.</i></font>

778
00:41:07.683 --> 00:41:10.268
Basic premise of cybernetting an office,

779
00:41:10.292 --> 00:41:11.496
is make things more efficient.

780
00:41:11.649 --> 00:41:14.569
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Monday mornings, all I can do is
thinking about next week.</i></font>

781
00:41:14.789 --> 00:41:17.659
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?

782
00:41:17.827 --> 00:41:18.849
Absolutely.

783
00:41:19.769 --> 00:41:22.039
Efficiency is priority no. 1, people.

784
00:41:22.379 --> 00:41:24.669
Because waste is a thief.

785
00:41:25.459 --> 00:41:27.494
I showed this already to my man here.

786
00:41:27.611 --> 00:41:28.872
You liked it, didn't you?

787
00:41:32.832 --> 00:41:35.359
<font color="#80ffff"><i>You can swallow a pint of blood

<font color="#80ffff"><i>It was right in everyone's face.</i></font>

789
00:41:39.919 --> 00:41:41.692
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Tyler and I just made it visible.</i></font>

790
00:41:41.729 --> 00:41:43.885
<font color="#80ffff"><i>It was on the tip of
everyone's tongue.</i></font>

791
00:41:44.225 --> 00:41:45.894
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Tyler and I just gave it a name.</i></font>

792
00:41:57.574 --> 00:42:00.414
Come on people, you have gotta go home!

793
00:42:21.969 --> 00:42:24.069
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.

794
00:42:46.089 --> 00:42:47.157
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Every week,</i></font>

795
00:42:47.181 --> 00:42:49.549
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Tyler gave the rules
that he and I decided.</i></font>

796
00:42:49.629 --> 00:42:50.695
Gentlemen!

797
00:42:51.719 --> 00:42:53.095
Welcome to Fight Club.

798
00:42:56.219 --> 00:42:58.001
The first rule of Fight Club is...

799
00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:00.229
you do not talk about Fight Club.

800
00:43:01.092 --> 00:43:03.065
The second rule of Fight Club is...

801
00:43:03.836 --> 00:43:06.699
you do not talk about Fight Club!

802
00:43:07.699 --> 00:43:08.954
Third rule of Fight Club

803
00:43:09.212 --> 00:43:10.597
someone yells stop,

804
00:43:10.621 --> 00:43:12.489
goes limp, taps out,

805
00:43:12.905 --> 00:43:14.052
the fight is over.

806
00:43:14.765 --> 00:43:15.643
Fourth rule.

807
00:43:15.812 --> 00:43:17.385
Only two guys to a fight.

808
00:43:17.949 --> 00:43:19.064
Fifth rule.

809
00:43:19.565 --> 00:43:21.032
One fight at a time, fellas.

810
00:43:22.159 --> 00:43:25.025
Sixth rule, no shirts, no shoes.

811
00:43:25.338 --> 00:43:26.488
Seventh rule.

812
00:43:26.679 --> 00:43:29.376
Fights will go on as long as they have to.

813
00:43:31.629 --> 00:43:33.703
And the eighth and final rule.

814
00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:36.598
If this is your first night at Fight Club,

815
00:43:38.317 --> 00:43:39.304
you have to fight.

816
00:43:44.282 --> 00:43:45.507
<font color="#80ffff"><i>This kid from work,</i></font>

817
00:43:45.531 --> 00:43:49.168
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Ricky, couldn't remember whether
you ordered pens with blue ink or black.</i></font>

818
00:43:51.529 --> 00:43:53.530
<font color="#80ffff"><i>But Ricky was a god for ten minutes</i></font>

819
00:43:53.555 --> 00:43:56.121
<font color="#80ffff"><i>when he trounced
the maître D' of a local food court.</i></font>

820
00:43:59.509 --> 00:44:01.297
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Sometimes,
all you could hear were the flat,</i></font>

821
00:44:01.322 --> 00:44:03.442
<font color="#80ffff"><i>hard, packing sounds over the yelling.</i></font>

822
00:44:07.589 --> 00:44:10.892
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Or the wet choke when someone
caught their breath and sprayed...</i></font>

823
00:44:10.985 --> 00:44:11.985
Stop!

824
00:44:12.786 --> 00:44:14.992
<font color="#80ffff"><i>You were not alive anywhere
like you were there.</i></font>

825
00:44:15.545 --> 00:44:17.539
<font color="#80ffff"><i>But Fight Club only exists in the hours</i></font>

826
00:44:17.563 --> 00:44:20.385
<font color="#80ffff"><i>between when Fight Club
starts and when Fight Club ends.</i></font>

827
00:44:21.505 --> 00:44:23.834
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Even if I could tell someone
they had a good fight,</i></font>

828
00:44:24.034 --> 00:44:25.914
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I would not be talking
to the same man.</i></font>

829
00:44:26.189 --> 00:44:27.519
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Who you were in Fight Club</i></font>

830
00:44:27.544 --> 00:44:29.801
<font color="#80ffff"><i>is not who you were
in the rest of the world.</i></font>

831
00:44:30.775 --> 00:44:32.971
<font color="#80ffff"><i>A guy came to Fight Club for the first
time.</i></font>

832
00:44:32.995 --> 00:44:34.899
<font color="#80ffff"><i>His ass was a wad of cookie dough.</i></font>

833
00:44:34.924 --> 00:44:37.715
<font color="#80ffff"><i>After a few weeks,
he was carved out of wood.</i></font>

834
00:44:39.142 --> 00:44:41.015
If you could fight any celebrity,
who would you fight?

835
00:44:41.909 --> 00:44:43.064
Alive or dead?

836
00:44:43.581 --> 00:44:44.935
Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?

837
00:44:46.119 --> 00:44:47.068
Hemingway.

838
00:44:48.212 --> 00:44:48.925
You?

839
00:44:50.052 --> 00:44:51.030
Shatner.

840
00:44:51.406 --> 00:44:52.891
I would fight William Shatner.

841
00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:57.505
<font color="#80ffff"><i>We all started seeing things differently.</i></font>

842
00:44:58.478 --> 00:45:01.559
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Everywhere we went,
we were sizing things up.</i></font>

843
00:45:06.015 --> 00:45:08.354
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,</i></font>

844
00:45:08.379 --> 00:45:10.605
<font color="#80ffff"><i>trying to look like how Calvin Klein</i></font>

845
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:12.419
<font color="#80ffff"><i>or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.</i></font>

846
00:45:12.529 --> 00:45:14.312
Is that what a man looks like?

847
00:45:16.085 --> 00:45:18.109
Self-improvement is masturbation.

848
00:45:18.529 --> 00:45:20.159
Now, self destruction...

849
00:45:20.819 --> 00:45:21.892
Excuse me.

850
00:45:57.399 --> 00:45:59.825
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Fight Club was not about winning or losing.</i></font>

851
00:46:00.209 --> 00:46:01.765
<font color="#80ffff"><i>It was not about words.</i></font>

852
00:46:04.659 --> 00:46:07.132
<font color="#80ffff"><i>The hysterical shouting was in tongues,</i></font>

853
00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:09.645
<font color="#80ffff"><i>like at a Pentecostal Church.</i></font>

854
00:46:14.549 --> 00:46:16.339
Is that it?
Stop! Stop!

855
00:46:16.799 --> 00:46:18.284
<font color="#80ffff"><i>When the fight was over,</i></font>

856
00:46:18.815 --> 00:46:19.978
<font color="#80ffff"><i>nothing was solved.</i></font>

857
00:46:20.179 --> 00:46:21.609
<font color="#80ffff"><i>But nothing mattered.</i></font>

858
00:46:21.929 --> 00:46:22.842
Cool.

859
00:46:25.389 --> 00:46:27.889
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Afterwards, we all felt saved.</i></font>

860
00:46:27.979 --> 00:46:30.389
Hey, man. How about next week?

861
00:46:31.479 --> 00:46:32.965
How about next month?

862
00:46:33.729 --> 00:46:34.926
Irvine, you are in the middle.

863
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:36.518
New guy, you too.

864
00:46:39.491 --> 00:46:41.185
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.</i></font>

865
00:46:41.392 --> 00:46:42.918
He fell down some stairs.

866
00:46:43.989 --> 00:46:45.603
I fell down some stairs.

867
00:46:48.048 --> 00:46:52.418
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Fight Club became the reason to cut
your hair short or trim your fingernails.</i></font>

868
00:46:52.709 --> 00:46:53.528
Ok.

869
00:46:53.818 --> 00:46:54.975
Any historical figure.

870
00:46:55.789 --> 00:46:57.115
I would fight Gandhi.

871
00:46:58.983 --> 00:46:59.711
Good answer.

872
00:47:00.419 --> 00:47:01.452
How about you?

873
00:47:01.692 --> 00:47:02.379
Lincoln.

874
00:47:02.945 --> 00:47:03.759
Lincoln?

875
00:47:05.009 --> 00:47:06.249
Big guy, big reach.

876
00:47:06.273 --> 00:47:08.032
Skinny guys fight till they are burger.

877
00:47:09.019 --> 00:47:09.819
Fuck!

878
00:47:12.519 --> 00:47:13.256
Hey,

879
00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:14.933
even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.

880
00:47:24.199 --> 00:47:25.114
Hello?

881
00:47:25.452 --> 00:47:27.341
<i>Where have you been the last eight weeks?</i>

882
00:47:28.628 --> 00:47:29.449
<i>Marla?</i>

883
00:47:32.829 --> 00:47:35.444
How did you find me?
<i>You left a forwarding number.</i>

884
00:47:36.152 --> 00:47:38.452
I have not seen you at any support groups.

885
00:47:39.138 --> 00:47:42.058
<i>We split them up.
That was the idea. Remember?</i>

886
00:47:42.299 --> 00:47:44.583
Yeah, but you have not been going to yours.

887
00:47:45.372 --> 00:47:46.414
How do you know?

888
00:47:46.905 --> 00:47:47.905
I cheated.

889
00:47:49.179 --> 00:47:50.272
I found a new one.

890
00:47:51.232 --> 00:47:51.919
Really?

891
00:47:52.035 --> 00:47:53.335
It's for men only.

892
00:47:53.479 --> 00:47:55.059
Like the testicle thing?

893
00:47:59.695 --> 00:48:00.970
Look, this is a bad time.

894
00:48:00.994 --> 00:48:03.149
I have been going to Debtors Anonymous.

895
00:48:03.239 --> 00:48:06.367
<i>You wanna see some really fucked up people...</i>
I am just on my way out.

896
00:48:06.392 --> 00:48:09.192
Me too. I have got a stomach full of Xanax.

897
00:48:09.449 --> 00:48:11.356
I took what was left of a bottle.

898
00:48:12.183 --> 00:48:13.705
It might have been too much.

899
00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:17.407
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Just picture watching Marla Singer throw herself
around her crummy apartment.</i></font>

900
00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:19.739
This is not a for-real suicide thing.

901
00:48:19.763 --> 00:48:21.616
This is probably just a cry for help things.

902
00:48:22.234 --> 00:48:23.896
<font color="#80ffff"><i>This could go on for hours.</i></font>

903
00:48:23.921 --> 00:48:25.787
So you are staying in tonight then?
Do you wanna wait...

904
00:48:26.181 --> 00:48:27.889
and hear me describe death?

905
00:48:29.014 --> 00:48:30.249
<i>Do you wanna listen,</i>

906
00:48:30.699 --> 00:48:32.814
<i>and see if my spirit can use a phone?</i>

907
00:48:34.759 --> 00:48:37.399
<i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>

908
00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:05.186
<i>Tyler's door was closed.</i>

909
00:49:05.888 --> 00:49:09.058
<i>I would been living here for two months
and Tyler's door was never closed.</i>

910
00:49:14.849 --> 00:49:16.931
You won't believe the dream
I had last night.

911
00:49:17.168 --> 00:49:19.823
I can hardly believe
anything from last night.

912
00:49:30.369 --> 00:49:31.623
What are you doing here?

913
00:49:36.335 --> 00:49:37.950
What?
This is my house.

914
00:49:37.975 --> 00:49:39.313
What are you doing in my house?

915
00:49:41.879 --> 00:49:42.987
Fuck you!

916
00:49:58.655 --> 00:50:01.745
Oh, you have got some fucked up friends!
I am telling you.

917
00:50:02.689 --> 00:50:03.843
Limber, though.

918
00:50:04.529 --> 00:50:05.662
Silly cooze.

919
00:50:07.592 --> 00:50:08.931
So I come in last night.

920
00:50:08.955 --> 00:50:10.016
Phone is off the hook.

921
00:50:10.073 --> 00:50:11.392
Guess who is on the other end.

922
00:50:11.572 --> 00:50:14.054
<font color="#000000"><i>I already knew the story
before he told it to me.</i></font>

923
00:50:17.095 --> 00:50:20.002
<i>Have you ever heard
a death rattle before?</i>

924
00:50:20.619 --> 00:50:22.729
Do you think it will live up to its name?

925
00:50:23.669 --> 00:50:25.615
<i>Or will it just be a death,</i>

926
00:50:25.865 --> 00:50:26.949
<i>hairball?</i>

927
00:50:30.091 --> 00:50:31.077
<i>Prepare...</i>

928
00:50:31.551 --> 00:50:33.478
<i>to evacuate soul.</i>

929
00:50:34.075 --> 00:50:34.916
<i>Ten.</i>

930
00:50:35.988 --> 00:50:36.792
<i>Nine.</i>

931
00:50:37.821 --> 00:50:38.661
<i>Eight.</i>

932
00:50:38.975 --> 00:50:42.393
<i>Now how could Tyler, of all people,
think it was a bad thing</i>

933
00:50:42.418 --> 00:50:44.241
<i>that Marla Singer was about to die?</i>

934
00:50:45.222 --> 00:50:45.927
<i>Five.</i>

935
00:50:46.835 --> 00:50:48.098
<i>Four.</i>

936
00:50:49.043 --> 00:50:49.917
<i>Three.</i>

937
00:50:50.148 --> 00:50:51.158
<i>Hang on.</i>

938
00:50:56.779 --> 00:50:58.705
You got here fast.

939
00:51:01.119 --> 00:51:02.669
Did I call you?

940
00:51:13.469 --> 00:51:16.599
The mattress is all sealed
in slippery plastic.

941
00:51:19.645 --> 00:51:20.711
Don't worry.

942
00:51:20.735 --> 00:51:22.315
It's not a threat to you.

943
00:51:25.505 --> 00:51:26.801
Oh, fuck!

944
00:51:26.991 --> 00:51:29.340
Somebody called the cops.

945
00:51:41.079 --> 00:51:42.567
513. Hey, where is 513?

946
00:51:42.731 --> 00:51:44.351
End of the hall.

947
00:51:45.419 --> 00:51:48.845
The have a girl who lives there
used to be a charming, lovely girl.

948
00:51:49.058 --> 00:51:50.838
She has lost faith in herself.

949
00:51:51.542 --> 00:51:53.286
Miss Singer, let us help you!

950
00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:54.183
She is a monster!

951
00:51:54.208 --> 00:51:56.080
You have every reason to live.

952
00:51:56.104 --> 00:51:58.090
She is infectious human waste!

953
00:51:58.515 --> 00:52:01.435
Miss Singer!
Good luck trying to save her!

954
00:52:07.622 --> 00:52:09.510
If I fall asleep,

955
00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:11.433
I am done for.

956
00:52:12.899 --> 00:52:15.240
You are gonna have to keep me up...

957
00:52:15.966 --> 00:52:17.840
all night.

958
00:52:17.949 --> 00:52:19.782
Un fucking believable.

959

<font color="#80ffff"><i>He was obviously able to handle it.</i></font>

960
00:52:22.462 --> 00:52:23.858
You know what I mean. You fucked her.

961
00:52:25.155 --> 00:52:26.155
No, I didn't.

962
00:52:27.395 --> 00:52:28.725
Never?
No.

963
00:52:30.299 --> 00:52:31.574
You are not into her, are you?

964
00:52:31.945 --> 00:52:33.589
No! God, not at all.

966

Are you sure?

967
00:52:37.772 --> 00:52:39.685
You can tell me.
Believe me, I am sure.

968
00:52:40.152 --> 00:52:41.259
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Put a gun to my head</i></font>

969

<font color="#80ffff"><i>and paint the walls with my brains.</i></font>

970
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.762
That's good.

971
00:52:43.787 --> 00:52:45.755
Because she is a predator
posing as a house pet.

972
00:52:45.912 --> 00:52:47.089
Stay away from her.

973
00:52:49.882 --> 00:52:52.479
Shit came out of this woman's mouth,
I had never heard!

974
00:52:52.569 --> 00:52:53.906
My God.

975
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:56.746
I have not been fucked like that
since grade school.

976
00:52:58.737 --> 00:53:00.369
<font color="#80ffff"><i>How could Tyler not go for that?</i></font>

977

<font color="#80ffff"><i>The night before last, he was splicing
sex organs into Cinderella.</i></font>

978

Marla doesn't need a lover,
she needs a fucking caseworker.

979
00:53:06.553 --> 00:53:07.652
She needs a wash.

980
00:53:07.755 --> 00:53:09.359
This is not love, it's sport fucking.

981

<font color="#80ffff"><i>She invaded my support groups

Hey, hey. Sit down.

983
00:53:19.179 --> 00:53:20.185
Now listen,

984
00:53:20.805 --> 00:53:22.458
I can't have you talking to her about me.

985
00:53:22.482 --> 00:53:24.809
Why would I talk to her?
You say anything about me

986
00:53:24.885 --> 00:53:27.046
or what goes on in this
house to her or anybody,

987
00:53:27.536 --> 00:53:28.511
we are done.

988
00:53:29.149 --> 00:53:30.341
Now promise me.

989
00:53:30.365 --> 00:53:31.232
Ok.

990
00:53:31.439 --> 00:53:32.385
You promise?

991
00:53:32.409 --> 00:53:33.294
Yeah, I promise.

992
00:53:33.319 --> 00:53:34.011
Promise.

993
00:53:34.035 --> 00:53:36.004
I just said, I promise! What...

994
00:53:36.029 --> 00:53:37.525
That's three times you promised.

Harder!

999
00:53:52.638 --> 00:53:53.712
Harder, yes!

00:54:08.059 --> 00:54:09.180
<font color="#80ffff"><i>But I didn't.</i></font>

1003
00:54:33.752 --> 00:54:34.864
What are you doing?

1004
00:54:36.251 --> 00:54:37.217
Just going to bed.

1005
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:39.995
You wanna finish her off?

1006
00:54:42.719 --> 00:54:43.497
No.

1007
00:54:44.147 --> 00:54:45.932
No, thank you.
I found a cigarette.

1008
00:54:47.389 --> 00:54:49.579
Who were you talking to?
Shut up.

1009
00:54:50.689 --> 00:54:53.229
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I became the calm
little centre of the world.</i></font>

1010
00:54:53.939 --> 00:54:55.769
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I was the Zen master.</i></font>

1011
00:55:01.069 --> 00:55:03.001
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I wrote little haiku poems.</i></font>

1012
00:55:03.975 --> 00:55:05.941
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I emailed them to everyone.</i></font>

1013
00:55:06.989 --> 00:55:08.699
Is that your blood?

1014
00:55:10.869 --> 00:55:11.912
Some of it, yeah.

1015
00:55:12.169 --> 00:55:13.619
You can't smoke in here.

1016
00:55:15.999 --> 00:55:19.177
Take the rest of the day off.
Come back Monday with some clean clothes.

1017
00:55:19.709 --> 00:55:21.057
Get yourself together.

1018
00:55:21.689 --> 00:55:24.371
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I got right in everyone's
hostile little face.</i></font>

1019
00:55:24.501 --> 00:55:26.715
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Yes, these are bruises from fighting.</i></font>

1020
00:55:26.759 --> 00:55:28.709
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Yes, I am comfortable with that.</i></font>

1021
00:55:29.099 --> 00:55:30.755
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I am enlightened.</i></font>

1022
00:55:33.152 --> 00:55:34.924
<font color="#80ffff"><i>You give up the condo life,</i></font>

1023
00:55:35.028 --> 00:55:37.544
<font color="#80ffff"><i>give up all your flaming
worldly possessions,</i></font>

1024
00:55:37.819 --> 00:55:41.609
<font color="#80ffff"><i>go live in a dilapidated house

1026
00:55:43.626 --> 00:55:44.525
<font color="#80ffff"><i>to this.</i></font>

1027
00:55:55.669 --> 00:55:56.669
Hello?

1028
00:55:56.749 --> 00:55:59.839
<i>Yes, this is Detective Stern
with the Arson Unit.</i>

1029
00:56:00.379 --> 00:56:04.007
<i>We have new information about
the incident at your former condo.</i>

1030
00:56:04.567 --> 00:56:05.412
Yes?

1031
00:56:05.436 --> 00:56:07.164
I don't know if you are aware,
but it seems,

1032
00:56:07.188 --> 00:56:10.349
someone sprayed Freon
into your front-door lock.

1033
00:56:10.562 --> 00:56:13.349
<i>Then tapped it with a chisel
to shatter the cylinder.</i>

1034
00:56:13.439 --> 00:56:15.297
No, I was not aware of that at all.

1035
00:56:15.321 --> 00:56:17.106
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I am Jack's cold sweat.</i></font>

1036
00:56:17.386 --> 00:56:19.009
Does this sound strange to you?

1037
00:56:19.426 --> 00:56:21.551
<i>Yes, sir. Strange. Very strange.</i>

1038
00:56:22.012 --> 00:56:23.587
The dynamite, dynamite?

1039
00:56:23.612 --> 00:56:27.729
Left a residue of ammonium
oxalate potassium perchloride.

1040
00:56:28.175 --> 00:56:29.395
<i>Do you know what this means?</i>

1041
00:56:29.909 --> 00:56:31.262
No. What does it mean?

1042
00:56:31.705 --> 00:56:33.135
It means it was home-made.

1043
00:56:34.409 --> 00:56:35.442
I am sorry.

1044
00:56:35.466 --> 00:56:37.484
This is just coming
as quite a shock to me, sir.

1045
00:56:37.584 --> 00:56:39.571
See whoever set this oh mighty dynamite

1046
00:56:39.804 --> 00:56:43.379
could have blown out your pilot
light days before the actual explosion.

1047
00:56:43.644 --> 00:56:44.994
<i>The gas was just a detonator.</i>

1048
00:56:45.184 --> 00:56:46.592
Who'd go and do such a thing?

1049
00:56:46.632 --> 00:56:47.955
<i>I will ask the questions.</i>

1050
00:56:47.979 --> 00:56:49.052
Tell him.

1051
00:56:49.364 --> 00:56:52.932
Tell him the liberator who destroyed my property
realigned my perceptions.

1052
00:56:53.294 --> 00:56:54.947
<i>Excuse me. Are you there?</i>

1053
00:56:54.972 --> 00:56:58.513
Hello, I am listening, it's a little hard to know
what to make of all this.

1054
00:56:58.538 --> 00:57:00.666
Have you recently made enemies with anyone

1055
00:57:00.691 --> 00:57:02.872
who might have access
to home made dynamite?

1056
00:57:02.952 --> 00:57:05.641
Enemies?
I reject the basic assumption civilization,

1057
00:57:05.666 --> 00:57:07.621
especially the importance
of material possessions.

1058
00:57:07.646 --> 00:57:10.387
<i>Son, this is serious.</i>
Yes, I know it's serious.

1059
00:57:10.412 --> 00:57:11.312
<i>I mean that.</i>

1060
00:57:11.336 --> 00:57:13.079
Yes, it's very serious.

1061
00:57:13.159 --> 00:57:19.127
Look, nobody takes this more seriously
than me. That condo was my life. Ok?

1062
00:57:19.674 --> 00:57:22.519
I loved every stick
of furniture in that place.

1063
00:57:22.544 --> 00:57:25.710
<i>That was not just a bunch of stuff
that got destroyed.</i>

1064
00:57:25.737 --> 00:57:26.844
It was me!

1065
00:57:26.869 --> 00:57:28.064
<i>I would like to thank the Academy.</i>

1066
00:57:28.089 --> 00:57:29.872
<i>Is this not a good time for you?</i>

1067
00:57:30.056 --> 00:57:31.722
Just tell him you fucking did it!

1068
00:57:32.734 --> 00:57:34.335
Tell him you blew it all up!

1069
00:57:34.359 --> 00:57:36.172
That's what he wants to hear.

1070
00:57:36.849 --> 00:57:38.756
<i>Are you still there?</i>
Wait.

1071
00:57:39.432 --> 00:57:40.997
Are you saying that I am a suspect?

1072
00:57:41.022 --> 00:57:43.630
No, no. I may need to talk to you first,

1073
00:57:43.654 --> 00:57:45.755
how about you just let me know
if you are gonna leave town.

1074
00:57:46.352 --> 00:57:46.972
<i>Ok?</i>

1075
00:57:47.322 --> 00:57:48.098
Ok.

1076
00:57:51.319 --> 00:57:52.664
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Except for their humping,</i></font>

1077
00:57:52.689 --> 00:57:55.069
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Tyler and Marla were never
in the same room.</i></font>

1078
00:57:55.582 --> 00:57:58.535
<font color="#80ffff"><i>My parents pulled
this exact same act for years.</i></font>

1079
00:57:58.589 --> 00:58:01.742
The condom is the glass slipper
of our generation.

1080
00:58:02.539 --> 00:58:05.379
You slip one on when you meet a stranger.

1081
00:58:05.689 --> 00:58:07.701
You dance all night,

1082
00:58:08.408 --> 00:58:09.399
then you throw it away.

1083
00:58:10.259 --> 00:58:11.622
The condom, I mean.

1084
00:58:11.646 --> 00:58:13.009
Not the stranger.

1085
00:58:14.389 --> 00:58:15.200
What?

1086
00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:23.149
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.

1087
00:58:23.229 --> 00:58:25.019
It was worth every penny.

1088
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:27.330
It's a bridesmaid's dress.

1089
00:58:29.199 --> 00:58:33.246
Someone loved it intensely for one day,

1090
00:58:34.369 --> 00:58:35.586
then tossed it.

1091
00:58:37.579 --> 00:58:39.409
Like a Christmas tree.

1092
00:58:40.085 --> 00:58:41.733
So special.

1093
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:44.749
Then... bam!

1094
00:58:45.629 --> 00:58:47.449
It's on the side of the road.

1095
00:58:48.431 --> 00:58:50.561
Tinsel still clinging to it.

1096
00:58:52.469 --> 00:58:54.456
Like a sex crime victim,

1097
00:58:55.215 --> 00:58:57.084
underwear inside out,

1098
00:58:58.035 --> 00:58:59.702
bound with electrical tape.

1099
00:58:59.889 --> 00:59:01.004
Well then it suits you.

1100
00:59:02.515 --> 00:59:04.091
You can borrow it sometime.

1101
00:59:11.741 --> 00:59:12.694
Get rid of her.

1102
00:59:13.788 --> 00:59:15.602
What? You get rid of her!

1103
00:59:15.626 --> 00:59:16.587
Don't mention me.

1104
00:59:16.786 --> 00:59:20.482
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I am six years old again,
passing messages between parents.</i></font>

1105
00:59:24.209 --> 00:59:26.155
You know what? I really think
it's time you got out of here.

1106
00:59:26.179 --> 00:59:27.190
Don't worry, I am leaving.

1107
00:59:27.215 --> 00:59:28.615
Not that we don't love your little visits.

1108
00:59:28.639 --> 00:59:31.541
You know, you are such a nutcase.
I can't even began to keep up.

1110
00:59:36.432 --> 00:59:37.432

1113
00:59:52.819 --> 00:59:54.069
You kids!

1114
00:59:55.094 --> 00:59:57.804
Why do you still waste time with her?

1115
00:59:59.659 --> 01:00:00.981
I will say this about Marla.

1116
01:00:01.005 --> 01:00:02.789
At least she is trying to hit bottom.

1117
01:00:02.869 --> 01:00:04.289
What, and I am not?

1118
01:00:04.612 --> 01:00:07.127
Sticking feathers up your butt
does not make you a chicken.

1119
01:00:08.669 --> 01:00:09.927
What are we doing tonight?

1120
01:00:10.795 --> 01:00:11.950
Tonight...

1121
01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:13.002
we make soap.

1122
01:00:13.799 --> 01:00:14.703
Really?

1123
01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:17.405
To make soap, first we render fat.

1124
01:00:37.549 --> 01:00:38.959
The salt balance has to be just right,

1125
01:00:39.015 --> 01:00:41.568
so the best fat for making soap
comes from humans.

1126
01:00:42.826 --> 01:00:44.024
Wait. What is this place?

1127
01:00:44.268 --> 01:00:45.647
A liposuction clinic.

1128
01:00:54.579 --> 01:00:55.351
Pay dirt!

1129
01:00:56.526 --> 01:00:58.705
Richest, creamiest fat in the world.

1130
01:00:59.182 --> 01:01:00.545
The fat of the land!

1131
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.964
No!

1132
01:01:07.927 --> 01:01:08.782
Don't pull it.

1133
01:01:13.439 --> 01:01:14.555
Oh, God!

1134
01:01:14.932 --> 01:01:16.212
Give me another one.

1135
01:01:23.478 --> 01:01:25.858
As the fat renders, the tallows float
to the surface.

1136
01:01:26.112 --> 01:01:27.492
Like in Boy Scouts.

1137
01:01:28.125 --> 01:01:30.028
It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.

1138
01:01:30.052 --> 01:01:31.065
Keep stirring.

1139
01:01:34.339 --> 01:01:36.979
Once the tallow hardens,
you skim off a layer of glycerine.

1140
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:39.839
If you would add nitric acid,
you got nitroglycerin.

1141
01:01:39.929 --> 01:01:41.369
If you then add sodium nitrate,

1142
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:42.583
and a dash of sawdust,

1143
01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:44.402
you got dynamite.

1144
01:01:45.139 --> 01:01:47.889
Yeah, with enough soap,
one could blow up just about anything.

1145
01:01:47.979 --> 01:01:50.242
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Tyler was full of useful information.</i></font>

1146
01:01:50.275 --> 01:01:54.302
Now ancient peoples found their clothes got cleaner
when washed in a certain point of the river.

1147
01:01:54.679 --> 01:01:56.312
You know why?
No.

1148
01:01:59.859 --> 01:02:02.699
Because human sacrifices were once made
on the hills above this river.

1149
01:02:03.005 --> 01:02:03.896
Bodies burned,

1150
01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.299
water seeped through the wooden ashes
to create lye.

1151
01:02:07.039 --> 01:02:08.108
This is lye.

1152
01:02:08.132 --> 01:02:09.334
The crucial ingredient.

1153
01:02:09.359 --> 01:02:11.278
Once it mixed with the melted fat
of the bodies,

1154
01:02:11.302 --> 01:02:13.724
thick white soapy discharge
crept into the river.

1155
01:02:13.839 --> 01:02:15.165
May I see your hand, please?

1156
01:02:23.099 --> 01:02:24.429
What is this?

1157
01:02:24.509 --> 01:02:26.182
This is a chemical burn.

1158
01:02:27.562 --> 01:02:29.909
It will hurt more than you have ever
been burned and you will have a scar.

1159
01:02:29.934 --> 01:02:30.696
What are you doing?

1160
01:02:30.995 --> 01:02:33.495
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Kind of meditation worked for cancer,
it could work for this.</i></font>

1161
01:02:34.212 --> 01:02:35.819
Stay with the pain. Don't shut this out.

1162
01:02:35.845 --> 01:02:37.239
No God! God!

1163
01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:38.565
Look at your hand.

1164
01:02:38.619 --> 01:02:40.525
The first soap was made
from the ashes of heroes,

1165
01:02:40.619 --> 01:02:42.385
like the first monkey shot into space.

1166
01:02:42.512 --> 01:02:44.645
Without pain, without sacrifice,

1167
01:02:44.669 --> 01:02:45.685
we would have nothing.

1168
01:02:45.738 --> 01:02:48.289
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I tried not to think
of the words searing or flesh.</i></font>

1170
01:02:50.174 --> 01:02:51.746
this is your burning hand.
It's right here.

1171
01:02:51.771 --> 01:02:52.475
I am going to my cave.

1172
01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.117
I am going to my cave
to find my power animal.

1173
01:02:54.539 --> 01:02:57.783
No! Don't deal with this
the way those dead people do!

1174
01:02:57.807 --> 01:02:58.419
Come on!

1175
01:02:58.444 --> 01:02:59.517
I get the point! Ok, please!
No!

1176
01:02:59.597 --> 01:03:01.550
What you are feeling
is premature enlightenment.

1177
01:03:06.265 --> 01:03:08.126
It's the greatest moment of your life, man,

1178
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:09.965
and you are off somewhere missing it!
I am not...

1179
01:03:11.189 --> 01:03:12.339
Shut up!

1180
01:03:12.762 --> 01:03:14.309
Our fathers were our models for God.

1181
01:03:14.369 --> 01:03:17.375
If our fathers bailed,
what does that tell you about God?

1182
01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.069
No, no, I...

1183
01:03:18.882 --> 01:03:19.782
Listen to me.

1184
01:03:20.802 --> 01:03:23.859
You have to consider the possibility
that God does not like you.

1185
01:03:23.989 --> 01:03:25.352
He never wanted you.

1186
01:03:25.535 --> 01:03:27.710
In all probability, he hates you.

1187
01:03:27.764 --> 01:03:29.231
This is not the worst thing
that can happen.

1188
01:03:29.256 --> 01:03:30.084
What is it?

1189
01:03:30.163 --> 01:03:31.365
We don't need him!

1190
01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:32.734
We don't! I agree! I gotta go!

1191
01:03:32.758 --> 01:03:34.490
Fuck damnation man, fuck redemption.

1192
01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:36.071
We are God's unwanted children?

1193
01:03:36.095 --> 01:03:37.024
So be it!

1194
01:03:37.049 --> 01:03:38.073
I am getting water!

1195
01:03:38.097 --> 01:03:39.199
Listen!

1196
01:03:39.223 --> 01:03:41.095
You can use water over
your head and make it worse or...

1197
01:03:41.308 --> 01:03:42.268
Look at me!

1198
01:03:42.784 --> 01:03:44.871
Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.

1199
01:03:44.895 --> 01:03:46.005
Please let me have it, please!

1200
01:03:46.136 --> 01:03:47.612
First, you have to give up.

1201
01:03:48.712 --> 01:03:50.043
First, you have to know,

1202
01:03:50.067 --> 01:03:51.060
not fear,

1203
01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.760
know that someday, you are gonna die.

1204
01:03:54.495 --> 01:03:55.933
You don't know how this feels!

1205
01:04:01.439 --> 01:04:04.621
It's only after we have lost everything
that we are free to do anything.

1206
01:04:06.467 --> 01:04:07.319
Ok.

1207
01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:24.244
Congratulations.

1208
01:04:24.634 --> 01:04:26.585
You are one step closer to hitting bottom.

1209
01:04:29.878 --> 01:04:33.172
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Tyler sold his soap to department stores
at $20 a bar.</i></font>

1210
01:04:33.623 --> 01:04:35.133
<font color="#80ffff"><i>God knows what they charged.</i></font>

1211
01:04:35.158 --> 01:04:36.631
This is the best soap.

1212
01:04:37.822 --> 01:04:38.998
Why, thank you, Susan.

1213
01:04:39.269 --> 01:04:40.483

1217
01:04:50.935 --> 01:04:54.062
The first rule of Fight Club
is you don't talk about Fight Club?

1218
01:04:54.668 --> 01:04:56.026
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I am half asleep again.</i></font>

1219
01:04:56.050 --> 01:04:58.017
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I must have left the original
in the copy machine.</i></font>

1220
01:04:58.042 --> 01:05:00.103
The second rule of Fight... Is this yours?

1221
01:05:02.299 --> 01:05:03.450
Pretend you are me.

1222
01:05:03.474 --> 01:05:05.379
Make a managerial decision.

1223
01:05:05.469 --> 01:05:07.529
You find this. What would you do?

1224
01:05:12.849 --> 01:05:14.118
Well, I gotta tell you,

1225
01:05:15.002 --> 01:05:18.302
I would be very, very careful
who you talk to about that.

1226
01:05:18.374 --> 01:05:20.175
Because the person who wrote that...

1227
01:05:20.427 --> 01:05:21.774
is dangerous.

1228
01:05:22.014 --> 01:05:26.520
And this button-down,
Oxford-cloth psycho might just snap

1229
01:05:26.587 --> 01:05:29.391
and then stalk from office to office

1230
01:05:29.471 --> 01:05:34.585
with an Armalite AR10 carbine
gas-powered semi-automatic weapon,

1231
01:05:34.869 --> 01:05:38.499
pumping round after round
into colleagues and co-workers.

1232
01:05:40.169 --> 01:05:42.787
This might be someone
you have known for years.

1233
01:05:43.209 --> 01:05:46.784
Someone very, very close to you.

1234
01:05:47.438 --> 01:05:49.837
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.</i></font>

1235
01:05:51.569 --> 01:05:53.489
<font color="#80ffff"><i>And I used to be such a nice guy.</i></font>

1236
01:05:53.536 --> 01:05:56.916
Or maybe you should not bring me every
little piece of trash you happened to pick up.

1237
01:06:00.519 --> 01:06:01.758
Compliance and Liability.

1238
01:06:02.335 --> 01:06:03.772
My tit is gonna rot off.

1239
01:06:05.902 --> 01:06:07.549
Will you excuse me?
I need to take this.

1240
01:06:14.128 --> 01:06:15.178
What are you talking about.

1241
01:06:15.285 --> 01:06:17.678
I need you to check and see if there is
a lump in my breast.

1242
01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:19.276
Go to a hospital.

1243
01:06:19.353 --> 01:06:21.468
I can't afford to throw money on a doctor.

1244
01:06:22.884 --> 01:06:24.361
I don't know about this, Marla.

1245
01:06:25.264 --> 01:06:26.117
Please?

1246
01:06:26.829 --> 01:06:28.368
<font color="#80ffff"><i>She didn't call Tyler.</i></font>

1247
01:06:28.505 --> 01:06:30.112
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I'm neutral in her book.</i></font>

1248
01:06:32.349 --> 01:06:33.415
That's nice.

1249
01:06:33.882 --> 01:06:35.083
Taking food to Mrs...

1250
01:06:35.448 --> 01:06:36.654
Haniver and Mrs. Raines.

1251
01:06:36.679 --> 01:06:38.348
Where are they, exactly?

1252
01:06:38.559 --> 01:06:39.921
Tragically, they are dead.

1253
01:06:40.081 --> 01:06:41.756
I am alive and I am in poverty.

1254
01:06:41.987 --> 01:06:43.082
You want any?

1255
01:06:43.229 --> 01:06:44.954
No, no.
I got one for you.

1256
01:06:45.248 --> 01:06:46.621
Thanks for the thought.

1257
01:06:48.399 --> 01:06:49.968
What happened to your hand?

1258
01:06:51.136 --> 01:06:52.174
Oh, nothing.

1259
01:06:53.942 --> 01:06:54.715
Right there?

1260
01:06:56.409 --> 01:06:57.439
Feel anything?

1261
01:06:58.435 --> 01:06:59.054
No.

1262
01:06:59.079 --> 01:07:00.195
Well, make sure.

1263
01:07:02.059 --> 01:07:03.320
Ok, I am pretty sure.

1264
01:07:04.492 --> 01:07:05.322
You feel nothing?

1265
01:07:06.249 --> 01:07:07.385
No, nothing.

1266
01:07:09.419 --> 01:07:10.911
Well, that's a relief.

1267
01:07:11.465 --> 01:07:12.275
Thank you.

1268
01:07:12.806 --> 01:07:13.678
I... I mean...

1269
01:07:13.679 --> 01:07:14.706
No problem.

1270
01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:16.365
I wish I could return the favour.

1271
01:07:16.929 --> 01:07:19.513
There is not a lot of breast cancer
in the men of my family.

1272
01:07:19.615 --> 01:07:20.712
I could check your prostate.

1273
01:07:20.996 --> 01:07:22.433
I think I am ok.

1274
01:07:23.193 --> 01:07:24.733
Well, thanks, anyway.

1275
01:07:29.819 --> 01:07:30.805
Are we done?

1276
01:07:31.379 --> 01:07:32.292
Yeah, we are done.

1277
01:07:32.459 --> 01:07:33.965
See you... around.

1278
01:07:51.629 --> 01:07:52.897
Cornelius?

1279
01:07:53.917 --> 01:07:55.044
Cornelius!

1280
01:07:56.349 --> 01:07:57.582
It's me!

1281
01:07:57.962 --> 01:07:58.719
Bob!

1282
01:07:59.049 --> 01:08:00.289
Hey, Bob.

1283
01:08:04.482 --> 01:08:06.862
We all thought you were dead.
No, no. Still here.

1284
01:08:07.642 --> 01:08:08.762
How are you, Bob?

1285
01:08:09.777 --> 01:08:11.497
Better than I have ever
been in my whole life.

1286
01:08:11.522 --> 01:08:13.912
Really? Still Remaining Men Together?

1287
01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:16.359
No, no.
I got something so much better now.

1288
01:08:16.449 --> 01:08:17.912
Really, what is it?

1289
01:08:19.405 --> 01:08:20.278
Well...

1290
01:08:21.249 --> 01:08:22.732
The first rule is,

1291
01:08:23.375 --> 01:08:25.055
I am not supposed to talk about it.

1292
01:08:26.355 --> 01:08:27.789
And the second rule is...

1293
01:08:27.879 --> 01:08:29.539
I am not supposed to talk about it.

1294
01:08:29.822 --> 01:08:31.616
And the third rule is...
Bob, Bob.

1295
01:08:32.086 --> 01:08:33.328
I am a member.

1296
01:08:34.179 --> 01:08:35.688
Look at my face, Bob.

1297
01:08:38.179 --> 01:08:40.469
Oh, that's fucking... Fucking great.

1298
01:08:40.699 --> 01:08:42.377
I have never seen you there.

1299
01:08:42.854 --> 01:08:44.405
I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.

1300
01:08:45.022 --> 01:08:46.237
I go Saturday.

1301
01:08:46.481 --> 01:08:47.862
Congratulations.

1302
01:08:49.015 --> 01:08:50.815
Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?

1303
01:08:50.849 --> 01:08:52.975
Have you heard about the guy
that invented this thing?

1304
01:08:53.819 --> 01:08:55.989
Yeah, actually...
I hear all kinds of things.

1305
01:08:56.282 --> 01:08:57.851
Yeah.
Supposedly,

1306
01:08:58.349 --> 01:09:00.622
he was born in a mental institution,

1307
01:09:00.909 --> 01:09:02.314
and he sleeps,

1308
01:09:02.622 --> 01:09:03.989
only one hour a night.

1309
01:09:04.822 --> 01:09:06.335
He is a great man.

1310
01:09:07.709 --> 01:09:09.492
Do you know about Tyler Durden?

1311
01:09:35.485 --> 01:09:36.859
I didn't hurt you, did I?

1312
01:09:37.592 --> 01:09:39.005
Actually, you did.

1313
01:09:40.069 --> 01:09:41.311
Thank you for this.

1314
01:09:41.739 --> 01:09:43.831
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1316
01:09:45.445 --> 01:09:46.518

1319
01:09:51.178 --> 01:09:54.115
I look around, I look around,
I see a lot of new faces.

1320
01:09:56.009 --> 01:09:57.488
Shut up!

1321
01:09:58.925 --> 01:10:01.975
Which means a lot of people have been
breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.

1322
01:10:10.979 --> 01:10:14.705
Man, I see in Fight Club the strongest
and smartest men who've ever lived.

1323
01:10:15.658 --> 01:10:17.263
I see all this potential.

1324
01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:19.311
And I see it squandered.

1325
01:10:21.206 --> 01:10:24.133
Goddamn it,
an entire generation pumping gas.

1326
01:10:24.626 --> 01:10:25.939
Waiting tables.

1327
01:10:26.442 --> 01:10:28.332
Slaves with white collars.

1328
01:10:30.959 --> 01:10:33.715
Advertising has us chasing
cars and clothes.

1329
01:10:34.152 --> 01:10:37.395
Working jobs we hate
so we can buy shit we don't need.

1330
01:10:41.359 --> 01:10:43.373
We are the middle children of history, men.

1331
01:10:43.885 --> 01:10:45.689
No purpose or place.

1332
01:10:46.459 --> 01:10:47.985
We have no great war.

1333
01:10:48.479 --> 01:10:49.850
No great depression.

1334
01:10:52.377 --> 01:10:54.363
Our great war is a spiritual war.

1335
01:10:55.323 --> 01:10:56.636
Our great depression...

1336
01:10:57.246 --> 01:10:58.445
is our lives.

1337
01:11:02.526 --> 01:11:04.008
We have all been raised on television

1338
01:11:04.033 --> 01:11:06.001
to believe that one day
we could all be millionaires

1339
01:11:06.026 --> 01:11:08.119
and movie gods and rock stars.

1340
01:11:08.386 --> 01:11:09.719
But we won't.

1341
01:11:10.462 --> 01:11:12.148
We are slowly learning that fact.

1342
01:11:13.462 --> 01:11:14.404
And we are very,

1343
01:11:14.428 --> 01:11:16.068
very pissed off.

1344
01:11:16.249 --> 01:11:17.948
Yeah!

1345
01:11:21.014 --> 01:11:22.787
First rule of Fight Club is,

1346
01:11:22.997 --> 01:11:24.614
you do not talk about...

1347
01:11:30.139 --> 01:11:31.259
Who are you?

1348
01:11:32.349 --> 01:11:33.548
Who am I?

1349
01:11:33.572 --> 01:11:34.538
Yeah.

1350
01:11:36.199 --> 01:11:38.885
There is a sign on the front
that says Lou's Tavern.

1351
01:11:39.609 --> 01:11:41.055
I am fucking Lou.

1352
01:11:42.099 --> 01:11:43.465
Who the fuck are you?

1353
01:11:44.029 --> 01:11:45.209
Tyler Durden.

1354
01:11:48.917 --> 01:11:51.837
Who told you motherfuckers
that you could use my place?

1355
01:11:51.862 --> 01:11:53.422
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

1356
01:11:53.862 --> 01:11:54.698
Irvine?

1357
01:11:55.008 --> 01:11:56.571
Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.

1358
01:11:57.202 --> 01:11:58.573
He don't own this place.

1359
01:11:59.004 --> 01:11:59.656
I do.

1360
01:12:02.315 --> 01:12:04.037
How much money does he get for this?

1361
01:12:04.061 --> 01:12:05.049
There is no money.

1362
01:12:05.139 --> 01:12:06.122
Really?

1363
01:12:06.454 --> 01:12:07.197
Free to all.

1364
01:12:07.222 --> 01:12:08.124
Ain't that something.

1365
01:12:08.442 --> 01:12:09.588
It is, actually.

1366
01:12:10.219 --> 01:12:12.068
Look, stupid fuck!

1367
01:12:12.535 --> 01:12:14.714
I want everybody out of here right now.

1368
01:12:14.738 --> 01:12:17.359
Hey! You should join our club.

1369
01:12:18.665 --> 01:12:20.261
Did you hear what I just said?

1370
01:12:20.285 --> 01:12:21.463
You and your friend.

1371
01:12:25.155 --> 01:12:26.695
You hear me now?

1372
01:12:28.239 --> 01:12:29.966
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.

1373
01:12:36.959 --> 01:12:38.056
Still not getting it.

1374
01:12:40.530 --> 01:12:41.756
Ok, ok, ok, I got it.

1375
01:12:41.943 --> 01:12:44.316
I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.

1376
01:12:45.889 --> 01:12:47.395
Back! All of you!

1377
01:12:48.892 --> 01:12:50.242
Everybody back!

1378
01:12:58.741 --> 01:12:59.889
Lou!

1379
01:13:01.165 --> 01:13:02.387
Come on, man!

1380
01:13:03.138 --> 01:13:04.745
We really like this place.

1381
01:13:13.949 --> 01:13:16.238
That's right, Lou. Get it out.
Shut the fuck up.

1382
01:13:16.619 --> 01:13:18.209
Oh, yeah!

1383
01:13:22.799 --> 01:13:24.394
That's fucking funny?

1384
01:13:34.179 --> 01:13:36.457
Fucking guy's a loony, I am telling you.

1385
01:13:37.979 --> 01:13:39.205
Unbelievable.

1386
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:46.529
You don't know where I have been, Lou.
Oh, my God!

1387
01:13:47.699 --> 01:13:49.809
You don't know where I have been!

1388
01:13:53.329 --> 01:13:56.249
Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!

1389
01:13:56.329 --> 01:13:58.589
Fucking use the basement! Christ!

1390
01:13:58.614 --> 01:14:01.442
I want your word, Lou! I want your word!

1391
01:14:01.625 --> 01:14:03.375
On my mother's eyes.

1392
01:14:12.849 --> 01:14:13.995
Thanks, Lou.

1393
01:14:16.599 --> 01:14:17.849
You too, big guy.

1394
01:14:22.399 --> 01:14:23.849
We'll see you next week.

1395
01:14:40.039 --> 01:14:41.235
This week,

1396
01:14:41.859 --> 01:14:43.845
each one of you
has a homework assignment.

1397
01:14:45.165 --> 01:14:46.115
You are gonna go out.

1398
01:14:46.139 --> 01:14:47.325
You are gonna start a fight,

1399
01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:48.679
with a total stranger.

1400
01:14:51.889 --> 01:14:53.405
You are gonna start a fight,

1401
01:14:54.599 --> 01:14:56.052
and you are gonna lose.

1402
01:14:59.229 --> 01:15:00.505
Excellent choice, sir.

1403
01:15:02.729 --> 01:15:05.439
Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!

1404
01:15:05.729 --> 01:15:08.149
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.</i></font>

1405
01:15:11.659 --> 01:15:13.699
What... Son of a bitch!

1406
01:15:13.826 --> 01:15:15.228
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Most people,</i></font>

1407
01:15:15.252 --> 01:15:18.406
<font color="#80ffff"><i>normal people, do just
about anything to avoid a fight.</i></font>

1408
01:15:19.999 --> 01:15:21.499
Excuse me!

1409
01:15:21.579 --> 01:15:22.925
You sprayed me with your hose.

1410
01:15:23.919 --> 01:15:25.419
That's not necessary.

1411
01:15:25.499 --> 01:15:27.499
Jay! Go call 911!

1412
01:15:30.009 --> 01:15:31.169
Put the hose down.

1413
01:15:32.142 --> 01:15:33.972
Stop it! Stop it!

1414
01:15:37.059 --> 01:15:38.032
Sorry.

1415
01:15:46.616 --> 01:15:47.696
You bastard!

1416
01:15:53.449 --> 01:15:54.802
We need to talk.

1417
01:15:58.055 --> 01:15:58.975
Ok.

1418
01:16:00.909 --> 01:16:02.119
Where to begin?

1419
01:16:02.289 --> 01:16:04.742
With your constant absenteeism?

1420
01:16:05.355 --> 01:16:07.055
With your unpresentable appearance?

1421
01:16:08.024 --> 01:16:09.365
You are up for review.

1422
01:16:09.389 --> 01:16:12.734
I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.

1423
01:16:12.759 --> 01:16:13.599
What?

1424
01:16:13.769 --> 01:16:14.719
Let's pretend.

1425
01:16:14.955 --> 01:16:16.815
You are the Department of Transportation,

1426
01:16:17.175 --> 01:16:17.832
Ok?

1427
01:16:18.482 --> 01:16:20.626
Someone informs you that...

1428
01:16:20.768 --> 01:16:23.576
this company installs front seat
mounting brackets,

1429
01:16:23.716 --> 01:16:25.649
that never pass collision tests,

1430
01:16:25.729 --> 01:16:28.899
brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,

1431
01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:33.167
and fuel injectors that explode
and burn people alive.

1432
01:16:34.319 --> 01:16:35.327
What then?

1433
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:37.769
Are you threatening me?

1434
01:16:38.228 --> 01:16:39.109
No...

1435
01:16:39.134 --> 01:16:40.772
Get the fuck out of here. You are fired!

1436
01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:41.870
I have a better solution.

1437
01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:45.789
You keep me on the payroll
as an outside consultant

1438
01:16:46.349 --> 01:16:47.943
and in exchange for my salary,

1439
01:16:47.968 --> 01:16:51.535
my job will be never to tell people
these things that I know.

1440
01:16:52.524 --> 01:16:54.535
I don't even have to come into the office.

1441
01:16:54.559 --> 01:16:56.168
I can do this job from home.

1442
01:16:57.358 --> 01:16:59.957
Who... Who the fuck do you think you are?
You...

1443
01:17:00.207 --> 01:17:01.835
crazy little shit?

1444
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:07.215
Security!

1445
01:17:07.851 --> 01:17:10.551
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I am Jack's smirking revenge.</i></font>

1446
01:17:19.565 --> 01:17:20.969
What the hell are you doing?

1447
01:17:30.249 --> 01:17:31.419
That hurt.

1448
01:17:34.439 --> 01:17:35.652
Why would you do that?

1449
01:17:36.589 --> 01:17:39.545
Oh, my God! No! Please stop!

1450
01:17:49.729 --> 01:17:50.984
What are you doing?

1451
01:17:52.377 --> 01:17:54.417
Oh, God, no! Please! No!

1452
01:17:54.442 --> 01:17:56.639
<font color="#80ffff"><i>For some reason,
I thought of my first fight,</i></font>

1454
01:17:58.109 --> 01:17:59.081
No!

<font color="#80ffff"><i>Under and behind and inside
everything this man took for granted,</i></font>

<font color="#80ffff"><i>something horrible had been growing.</i></font>

1457
01:18:32.439 --> 01:18:33.259
Look.

1458
01:18:33.559 --> 01:18:35.843
Give me the pay cheques,
like I asked,

1459
01:18:36.125 --> 01:18:38.483
and you won't ever see me again.

1460
01:18:38.562 --> 01:18:41.961
<font color="#80ffff"><i>And right then,
at our most excellent moment together...</i></font>

1461
01:18:45.329 --> 01:18:46.397
Thank God!

1462
01:18:46.542 --> 01:18:47.982
Please don't hit me again.

1463
01:18:48.119 --> 01:18:50.770
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Telephone, computer, fax machine,</i></font>

1477
01:20:25.639 --> 01:20:27.832
Did you know there is a Fight
Club up in Delaware City.

1478
01:20:27.856 --> 01:20:28.905
Yeah, I heard.

1479
01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:32.420
There is one in Penns Grove too.

1480
01:20:32.445 --> 01:20:33.264
Leave it.

1481
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:35.139
Bob even found one up in New Castle.

1482
01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:36.590
Yeah, did you start that one?

1483
01:20:37.015 --> 01:20:38.924
No, I thought you did.
No.

1484
01:21:30.302 --> 01:21:32.095
Stop for a second.
Hey, what are we doing?

1485
01:21:32.168 --> 01:21:33.590
Turn around.
What are we doing?

1486
01:21:33.675 --> 01:21:34.899
Homework assignment.

1487
01:21:35.282 --> 01:21:36.654
What kind of homework assignment?

1488
01:21:36.679 --> 01:21:38.105
Human sacrifice.

1489
01:21:38.499 --> 01:21:39.737
Hey! Is that a gun?

1490
01:21:39.761 --> 01:21:41.304
Please!
Please tell me that's not a gun.

1491
01:21:41.306 --> 01:21:42.239
It's a gun.

1492
01:21:42.263 --> 01:21:43.340
Meet me in the back.

1493
01:21:43.419 --> 01:21:44.700
No, no! Hey! Don't fuck around!

1494
01:21:44.817 --> 01:21:46.222
Meet me in the back.

1495

Stop. What are you doing? Come on.

1498
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:56.065
Hands behind your back.

1499
01:21:56.849 --> 01:21:57.985
Give me your wallet.

1500
01:22:00.592 --> 01:22:03.551
Raymond K. Hessel.
1320 SE Banning, Apartment A.

1501
01:22:03.859 --> 01:22:05.739
Small cramped basement apartment?

1502
01:22:05.810 --> 01:22:06.538
How did you know?

1503
01:22:06.563 --> 01:22:09.299
Because they give shitty basement apartments
letters instead of numbers.

1504
01:22:09.869 --> 01:22:10.976
Raymond!

1505
01:22:12.075 --> 01:22:13.197
You are going to die.

1506
01:22:13.222 --> 01:22:14.095
No!

1507
01:22:15.289 --> 01:22:16.539
Is that your mom and dad?

1508
01:22:16.839 --> 01:22:19.269
Mom and dad are gonna have to call
the kindly doctor service over

1509
01:22:19.395 --> 01:22:21.222
to pick up your dental records.
You want to know why?

1510
01:22:21.582 --> 01:22:23.447
Because there will be
nothing left of your face.

1511
01:22:23.598 --> 01:22:25.075
Oh, come on! Come on!

1512
01:22:25.169 --> 01:22:27.827
An expired community college student ID.

1513
01:22:28.090 --> 01:22:29.448
What did you study, Raymond?

1514
01:22:29.725 --> 01:22:32.225
S... Stuff.
Stuff?

1515
01:22:32.429 --> 01:22:33.781
Were the midterms hard?

1516
01:22:35.639 --> 01:22:37.211
I asked you what you studied!

1517
01:22:37.235 --> 01:22:38.349
Biology, mostly.

1518
01:22:38.439 --> 01:22:39.338
Why?

1519
01:22:39.507 --> 01:22:41.729
I don't know.

1520
01:22:41.754 --> 01:22:44.037
What did you wanna be,
Raymond K. Hessel?

1521
01:22:46.109 --> 01:22:47.304
The question,

1522
01:22:47.441 --> 01:22:50.570
Raymond, was what did you want to be?

1523
01:22:52.471 --> 01:22:53.891
Answer him, Raymond! Jesus!

1524
01:22:53.972 --> 01:22:56.459
Veterinarian. Veterinarian.
Animals.

1525
01:22:56.585 --> 01:22:59.039
Yeah. Animal and stuff.
Stuff. Yeah, I got that.

1526
01:22:59.119 --> 01:23:00.972
That means that you
have to get more schooling.

1527
01:23:01.099 --> 01:23:02.209
Too much school.

1528
01:23:02.379 --> 01:23:04.503
Would you rather be dead?
No, please...

1529
01:23:04.528 --> 01:23:06.157
You would rather die, here,

1530
01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:08.522
on your knees,
in the back of a convenience store?

1531
01:23:09.589 --> 01:23:11.679
No. God please, no.

1532
01:23:15.509 --> 01:23:16.809
I am keeping your license.

1533
01:23:18.059 --> 01:23:19.632
Gonna check in on you.

1534
01:23:19.657 --> 01:23:21.212
I know where you live.

1535
01:23:22.349 --> 01:23:25.059
If you are not on your way to becoming
a veterinarian in six weeks,

1536
01:23:25.149 --> 01:23:26.399
you will be dead.

1537
01:23:29.029 --> 01:23:30.255
Now run on home.

1538
01:23:35.535 --> 01:23:37.495
Run, Forrest, run!

1539
01:23:38.949 --> 01:23:40.238
I feel ill.

1540
01:23:42.619 --> 01:23:44.028
Imagine how he feels.

1541
01:23:44.052 --> 01:23:45.789
Come on, this is not funny!

1542
01:23:45.879 --> 01:23:48.366
That was not funny.
What the fuck was the point of that?

1543
01:23:49.169 --> 01:23:52.215
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day
of Raymond K. Hessel's life.

1544
01:23:53.049 --> 01:23:56.322
His breakfast will taste better
than any meal you and I have ever tasted.

1545
01:23:58.639 --> 01:24:00.408
<font color="#80ffff"><i>You had to give it to him.</i></font>

1546
01:24:01.229 --> 01:24:03.022
Come on.
<font color="#80ffff"><i>He had a plan.</i></font>

1547
01:24:03.522 --> 01:24:06.368
<font color="#80ffff"><i>And it started to make sense
in a Tyler sort of way.</i></font>

1548
01:24:06.729 --> 01:24:07.885
<font color="#80ffff"><i>No fear.</i></font>

1549
01:24:08.309 --> 01:24:09.635
<font color="#80ffff"><i>No distractions.</i></font>

1550
01:24:10.369 --> 01:24:13.098
<font color="#80ffff"><i>The ability to let that
which does not matter,</i></font>

1551
01:24:13.208 --> 01:24:14.747
<font color="#80ffff"><i>in truly slide.</i></font>

1552
01:24:27.835 --> 01:24:29.181
<font color="#80ffff"><i>You are not your job.</i></font>

1553
01:24:31.925 --> 01:24:33.725
You are not how much money
you have in the bank.

1554
01:24:37.285 --> 01:24:38.425
You are not the car you drive.

1555
01:24:39.495 --> 01:24:41.325
You are not the contents of your wallet.

1556
01:24:43.269 --> 01:24:45.055
You are not your fucking khakis.

1557
01:24:47.479 --> 01:24:49.995
You are the all singing,
all dancing crap of the world.

1558
01:24:59.995 --> 01:25:01.635
I will be out of your way in a sec.

1559
01:25:03.119 --> 01:25:04.469
You don't have to go.

1560
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:07.622
Whatever.

1561
01:25:09.419 --> 01:25:10.614
No, I mean...

1562
01:25:12.211 --> 01:25:13.085
it's ok.

1563
01:25:22.708 --> 01:25:24.021
Are you still going to groups?

1564
01:25:25.599 --> 01:25:26.428
Yeah.

1565
01:25:28.899 --> 01:25:29.954
Chloe is dead.

1566
01:25:31.552 --> 01:25:32.372
Chloe.

1567
01:25:33.939 --> 01:25:35.132
When did that happen?

1568
01:25:36.452 --> 01:25:37.612
Do you care?

1569
01:25:38.779 --> 01:25:40.879
I don't know.
I have not thought about it in a while.

1570
01:25:41.838 --> 01:25:42.972
Yeah, well...

1571
01:25:44.132 --> 01:25:46.592
it was the smart move on her part.

1572
01:25:48.861 --> 01:25:49.942
Listen...

1573
01:25:51.039 --> 01:25:53.162
What... What are you getting out of all this?

1574
01:25:53.966 --> 01:25:54.875
What?

1575
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:58.135
I mean, all this. Why do you keep...

1576
01:25:59.139 --> 01:26:00.942
Is this making you happy?

1577
01:26:03.059 --> 01:26:04.551
Yeah, well, sometimes.

1578
01:26:06.671 --> 01:26:08.534
What... I don't know. I don't understand.

1579
01:26:08.731 --> 01:26:09.965
Why... Why does a...

1580
01:26:10.411 --> 01:26:13.344
weaker person need to latch on
to a strong person? What the...

1581
01:26:13.368 --> 01:26:14.391
What is that?

1582
01:26:14.729 --> 01:26:16.211
What do you get out of it?

1583
01:26:18.739 --> 01:26:21.727
No... That's not the same thing at all.
I mean it were...

1584
01:26:21.751 --> 01:26:23.124
It's totally different with us.

1585
01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:24.551
We... We...
Us?

1586
01:26:25.699 --> 01:26:27.232
What do you mean by us?

1587
01:26:27.256 --> 01:26:28.882
I am sorry. Do you hear this?

1588
01:26:29.595 --> 01:26:30.361
Hear what?

1589
01:26:30.385 --> 01:26:32.236
You are not hearing all that
noise? Hold on a second.

1590
01:26:32.421 --> 01:26:33.947
No, wait! What were you saying?

1591
01:26:33.971 --> 01:26:35.821
Don't change the subject!
I want to talk about this.

1592
01:26:35.974 --> 01:26:37.701
You are not talking about me, are you?

1593
01:26:37.725 --> 01:26:38.467
No.

1594
01:26:38.679 --> 01:26:39.038
What?

1595
01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:41.930
That day you came over to my place,
playing doctor. What was going on there?

1596
01:26:42.349 --> 01:26:43.791
What are you talking about?

1597
01:26:43.815 --> 01:26:45.389
Nothing. Nothing.

1598
01:26:45.469 --> 01:26:47.602
I don't think so.
Oh, come on. What do you want?

1599
01:26:47.829 --> 01:26:49.152
Look at me.
No. What?

1600
01:26:49.177 --> 01:26:50.055
Look at me.

1601
01:26:51.439 --> 01:26:52.716
What is that?

1602
01:26:52.913 --> 01:26:54.487
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

1603
01:26:54.512 --> 01:26:56.220
My God. Who did this?

1604
01:26:56.244 --> 01:26:57.189
A person.

1605
01:26:57.319 --> 01:26:58.500
Guy or girl?

1606
01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.471
What do you care if it's a guy or a girl?

1607
01:27:00.496 --> 01:27:01.751
What do you care if I ask?

1608
01:27:01.776 --> 01:27:03.378
It's none of your business. Leave me alone.
You are afraid to say.

1609
01:27:03.403 --> 01:27:05.270
I am not afraid to say. Let me go.
No. No!

1610
01:27:05.294 --> 01:27:06.198
Talk to me.

1611
01:27:06.223 --> 01:27:08.016
Let go of me. Leave me alone!
No!

1612
01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:10.211
This conversation...
This conversation...

1613
01:27:10.236 --> 01:27:12.459
is over.
Is over.

1614
01:27:14.459 --> 01:27:16.559
I just can't win with you, can I?

1615
01:27:25.589 --> 01:27:27.526
Hey, this is getting a little old!

1616
01:27:29.729 --> 01:27:31.302
What is... What is all this?

1617
01:27:31.839 --> 01:27:32.825
What do you think?

1618
01:27:34.729 --> 01:27:36.632
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?

1619
01:27:37.474 --> 01:27:38.238
Hey!

1620
01:27:46.052 --> 01:27:46.895
Too young.

1621
01:27:47.272 --> 01:27:48.032
Sorry.

1622
01:27:49.699 --> 01:27:51.289
What's all that? What...

1623
01:27:51.582 --> 01:27:54.027
Right, if that applicant is young,
tell him he is too young,

1624
01:27:54.051 --> 01:27:55.142
old too old, fat too fat.

1625
01:27:55.215 --> 01:27:56.209
Applicant?

1626
01:27:56.339 --> 01:27:58.824
If the applicant then waits for three days
without food,

1627
01:27:58.848 --> 01:28:00.068
shelter or encouragement,

1628
01:28:00.176 --> 01:28:02.087
he may then enter and begin his training.

1629
01:28:02.689 --> 01:28:03.968
Training for what?

1630
01:28:09.969 --> 01:28:11.348
You think this is a game?

1631
01:28:11.652 --> 01:28:13.902
You are too young to train here,
end of story.

1632
01:28:14.269 --> 01:28:16.643
Quit wasting our time.
Get the fuck out of here.

1633
01:28:21.609 --> 01:28:22.855
Bad news, friend.

1634
01:28:24.415 --> 01:28:25.789
It's not gonna happen.

1635
01:28:26.989 --> 01:28:28.842
Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.

1636
01:28:29.039 --> 01:28:30.856
It's not the end of the world.
Just...

1637
01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.154
go away.

1638
01:28:33.789 --> 01:28:34.668
Go.

1639
01:28:35.829 --> 01:28:38.662
You are trespassing
and I will have to call the police.

1640
01:28:43.328 --> 01:28:44.536
Don't you look at me!

1641
01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:46.258
You think you are ever getting in this house?

1642
01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:47.760
You are never getting
in this fucking house!

1643
01:28:47.849 --> 01:28:49.792
Never. Now get the fuck off my porch!

1644
01:28:49.816 --> 01:28:51.179
Get off my porch!

Tyler wanted us to be.</i></font>

1647
01:28:54.569 --> 01:28:56.542
I am gonna go inside
and I am gonna get a shovel.

1648
01:29:05.569 --> 01:29:06.835
Got two black shirts?

1649
01:29:07.795 --> 01:29:09.529
Sir?
Two pairs of black pants?

1650
01:29:09.554 --> 01:29:11.130
Yes, sir.
One pair black boots?

1651
01:29:11.154 --> 01:29:12.554
Sir.
Two pairs of black socks?

1652
01:29:12.579 --> 01:29:14.039
Sir.
One black jacket?

1653
01:29:14.119 --> 01:29:16.329
Sir.
$300 personal burial money?

1654
01:29:16.419 --> 01:29:17.337
Yes sir.

1655
01:29:20.299 --> 01:29:21.277
Alright.

1656
01:29:32.429 --> 01:29:33.920
You are too old fat man.

1657
01:29:35.495 --> 01:29:36.672
Your tits are too big.

1658
01:29:36.696 --> 01:29:38.325
Get the fuck off my porch.

1659
01:29:46.152 --> 01:29:47.532
Bob! Bob!

1660
01:30:03.629 --> 01:30:06.075
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.

1661
01:30:07.142 --> 01:30:08.328
Space monkey.

1662
01:30:09.179 --> 01:30:11.665
Ready to sacrifice himself
for the greater good.

1663
01:30:18.265 --> 01:30:20.585
You are too fucking old, fatty!

1664
01:30:21.589 --> 01:30:22.551
And you...

1665
01:30:23.162 --> 01:30:26.302
You are too fucking blond!

1666
01:30:26.442 --> 01:30:28.202
Get out of here, the both of you!

01:30:30.719 --> 01:30:32.131

01:30:33.119 --> 01:30:34.644

1670

No, no, no...

1680
01:31:12.029 --> 01:31:15.187
When he was like,
You are not your job,

1681
01:31:15.557 --> 01:31:17.697
I was like... Yeah!

1682
01:31:20.419 --> 01:31:21.693
Hey, what is all this?

1683
01:31:22.076 --> 01:31:22.898
Hey!

1684
01:31:25.642 --> 01:31:26.471
Ok!

1685
01:31:27.582 --> 01:31:29.419
What's going on?
We are celebrating.

1686
01:31:29.509 --> 01:31:31.022
What are we celebrating?
Go on.

1687
01:31:36.548 --> 01:31:37.167
Hey.

1688
01:31:37.344 --> 01:31:38.828
Let me get that for you.

1689
01:31:43.149 --> 01:31:44.549
<i>Same great taste.</i>

1690
01:31:44.573 --> 01:31:46.399
<i>Pepsi. Generation Next.</i>

1691
01:31:50.062 --> 01:31:52.139
<i>Investigators are on
the scene right now.</i>

1692
01:31:52.238 --> 01:31:54.660
<i>Hold on, Police Commissioner
Jacobs has just arrived.</i>

1693
01:31:54.779 --> 01:31:55.887
<i>Commissioner, please.</i>

1694
01:31:55.912 --> 01:31:58.085
<i>Could you please tell us what you think
has happened here?</i>

1695
01:31:58.272 --> 01:32:02.178
<i>We believe this is one of many
recent acts of vandalism around the city</i>

1696
01:32:02.345 --> 01:32:04.194
<i>somehow related to underground...</i>

1697
01:32:04.451 --> 01:32:05.778
<i>boxing clubs.</i>

1698
01:32:06.185 --> 01:32:09.249
<i>We will be coordinating
a rigorous investigation.</i>

1699
01:32:10.232 --> 01:32:13.529
<i>That was Police Commissioner Jacobs
who just arrived on the scene,</i>

1700
01:32:13.555 --> 01:32:16.430
<i>here of a four alarm fire that
broke out about an hour ago.</i>

1701
01:32:16.564 --> 01:32:18.237
<i>Live from the Parker Morris Building,</i>
she is hot.

1702
01:32:18.271 --> 01:32:19.317
<i>Lauren Sanchez.</i>

1703
01:32:19.375 --> 01:32:20.675
<i>Back to you in the studio.</i>

1704
01:32:21.559 --> 01:32:23.139
Yeah!
Yeah!

1705
01:32:24.649 --> 01:32:25.841
Holy shit!

1706
01:32:26.498 --> 01:32:27.202
Yeah!

1707
01:32:30.562 --> 01:32:31.176
Yeah.

1708
01:32:33.569 --> 01:32:35.288
What the fuck did you guys do?

1709
01:32:35.313 --> 01:32:36.309
<i>How the blaze started,</i>

1710
01:32:36.365 --> 01:32:38.745
<i>but arson investigators
are on the premises...</i>

1711
01:32:45.058 --> 01:32:48.359
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions, sir.

1712
01:32:55.582 --> 01:32:57.581
<i>The victory in the war against crime,</i>

1713
01:32:57.605 --> 01:32:59.122
<i>will not come overnight.</i>

1714
01:32:59.672 --> 01:33:01.668
<i>It will take dedication and commitment,</i>

1715
01:33:01.804 --> 01:33:04.244
<i>and most of all, cooperation.</i>

1716
01:33:04.269 --> 01:33:05.556
<i>Streets are safer now.</i>

1717
01:33:06.170 --> 01:33:07.729
<i>There is hope in the inner city.</i>

1718
01:33:08.382 --> 01:33:11.302
<i>However, this is only the beginning.</i>
I gotta take a piss.

1719
01:33:11.979 --> 01:33:13.764
<i>These are the first steps,</i>

1720
01:33:13.788 --> 01:33:15.075
<i>in a long journey.</i>

1721
01:33:15.659 --> 01:33:18.369
<i>That is why we have created Project Hope.</i>
Bob.

1722
01:33:18.572 --> 01:33:19.561
<i>Helping others,</i>

1723
01:33:19.585 --> 01:33:21.619
<i>with prevention and enforcement.</i>

1724
01:33:22.499 --> 01:33:24.699
<i>Project Hope will be a joint effort</i>

1725
01:33:24.935 --> 01:33:27.169
<i>between the police
and community leaders.</i>

1726
01:33:27.942 --> 01:33:29.715
<i>It will be a powerful new weapon</i>

1727
01:33:29.929 --> 01:33:31.499
<i>in the war against crime.</i>

1728
01:34:17.944 --> 01:34:21.797
Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack, Bob.
Man! His balls are ice-cold.

1729
01:34:23.719 --> 01:34:24.626
Hi.

1730
01:34:24.897 --> 01:34:26.849
You are gonna call off
your rigorous investigation.

1731
01:34:27.095 --> 01:34:29.689
You are gonna publicly state that
there is no underground group

1732
01:34:29.901 --> 01:34:30.590
or,

1733
01:34:31.141 --> 01:34:32.867
these guys are gonna take your balls.

1734
01:34:33.041 --> 01:34:33.629
No!

1735
01:34:33.654 --> 01:34:37.127
They are gonna send one to the New York Times
and one to the LA Times. Press release style.

1736
01:34:38.204 --> 01:34:39.099
Look.

1737
01:34:39.123 --> 01:34:41.323
The people you are after
are the people you depend on.

1738
01:34:42.054 --> 01:34:43.186
We cook your meals.

1739
01:34:43.463 --> 01:34:44.646
We haul your trash.

1740
01:34:44.903 --> 01:34:46.054
We connect your calls.

1741
01:34:46.299 --> 01:34:47.607
We drive your ambulances.

1742
01:34:48.099 --> 01:34:49.899
We guard you while you sleep.

1743
01:34:54.249 --> 01:34:56.049
Do not fuck with us.

1744
01:35:05.938 --> 01:35:06.732
Ball check!

1745
01:35:21.949 --> 01:35:23.109
Bob, this way.

1746
01:35:24.699 --> 01:35:25.772
Let's go.

1747
01:35:27.369 --> 01:35:30.079
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.</i></font>

1748
01:35:30.869 --> 01:35:31.772
Hey!

1749
01:35:47.599 --> 01:35:48.849
Yeah!

1750
01:36:21.592 --> 01:36:26.682
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of
every panda that would not screw to save its species.</i></font>

1751
01:36:29.679 --> 01:36:32.660
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I wanted to open
the dump valves on oil tankers</i></font>

1752
01:36:32.685 --> 01:36:35.562
<font color="#80ffff"><i>and smother all those French beaches
I would never see.</i></font>

1753
01:36:40.069 --> 01:36:42.090
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I wanted to breathe smoke.</i></font>

1754
01:36:59.209 --> 01:37:00.955
Where did you go, psycho boy?

1755
01:37:03.215 --> 01:37:05.135
I felt like destruct something beautiful.

1756
01:37:10.059 --> 01:37:12.145
Get him to a fucking hospital.
Yeah.

1757
01:37:24.569 --> 01:37:25.849
Don't worry, Mr. Durden.

1758
01:37:25.873 --> 01:37:27.609
Airport parking. Long term.

1759
01:37:29.079 --> 01:37:30.515
After you, Mr. Durden.

1760
01:37:32.329 --> 01:37:33.472
After you.

1761
01:37:51.679 --> 01:37:53.419
Something on your mind, dear?
No.

1762
01:37:54.624 --> 01:37:57.374
Alright, yeah. Why was not I told
about Project Mayhem?

1763
01:37:57.399 --> 01:38:00.759
First rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions.

1764
01:38:00.783 --> 01:38:01.630
What are you talking about?

1765
01:38:01.736 --> 01:38:03.345
Why didn't you include me
in the beginning?

1766
01:38:03.369 --> 01:38:05.029
Fight Club was the beginning.

1767
01:38:05.109 --> 01:38:08.143
Now it's moved out of the basements
and it's called Project Mayhem.

1768
01:38:08.595 --> 01:38:10.560
You and I started Fight Club together.

1769
01:38:10.584 --> 01:38:11.429
You remember that?

1770
01:38:11.549 --> 01:38:13.275
It's as much mine as it is yours.
You know?

1771
01:38:13.375 --> 01:38:14.630
Is this about you and me?

1772
01:38:14.632 --> 01:38:17.250
Yeah. I thought we were doing this together.
You are missing the point.

1773
01:38:17.329 --> 01:38:19.459
This does not belong to us.

1774
01:38:19.539 --> 01:38:21.321
We are not special.
Fuck that.

1775
01:38:21.345 --> 01:38:22.588
You should have told me.

1776
01:38:24.625 --> 01:38:25.532
Hey, Tyler!

1777
01:38:28.049 --> 01:38:30.139
Goddamn it, Tyler!
What do you want?

1778
01:38:30.219 --> 01:38:32.207
A statement of purpose?
Should I email you?

1779
01:38:32.231 --> 01:38:33.694
Should I put this on your action item list?

1780
01:38:33.719 --> 01:38:36.139
Oh, look...
You decide your own level of involvement!

1781
01:38:36.439 --> 01:38:38.479
I will! I wanna know certain things first!

1782
01:38:38.559 --> 01:38:41.165
The first rule of Project Mayhem...
Shut up!

1783
01:38:42.819 --> 01:38:44.976
I wanna know what you are thinking.
Fuck what you know!

1784
01:38:45.096 --> 01:38:47.276
You need to forget about what you know.
That's your problem.

1785
01:38:47.301 --> 01:38:49.349
Forget about what you thinking know
about life,

1786
01:38:49.572 --> 01:38:50.557
about friendship,

1787
01:38:50.582 --> 01:38:52.342
and especially about you and me.

1788
01:38:54.239 --> 01:38:56.299
What? What is that supposed to mean?
What...

1789
01:38:59.329 --> 01:39:00.529
What are you doing?

1790
01:39:03.199 --> 01:39:05.159
Guys, what will you wish you would done
before you die?

1791
01:39:05.275 --> 01:39:07.545
Paint a self portrait.
Build a house.

1792
01:39:08.049 --> 01:39:08.952
And you?

1793
01:39:08.976 --> 01:39:10.498
I don't know. Nothing. Nothing.

1794
01:39:10.572 --> 01:39:12.984
Get in the right lane.
You have to know the answer to this question!

1795
01:39:13.009 --> 01:39:16.017
If you died right now,
how would you feel about your life?

1796
01:39:16.042 --> 01:39:18.400
I don't know! I would not feel
anything good about my life.

1797
01:39:18.425 --> 01:39:20.198
Is that what you want to hear me say?
Fine.

1798
01:39:20.505 --> 01:39:22.099
Come on!
Not good enough.

1799
01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:24.645
Stop fucking around! Tyler!

1800
01:39:27.489 --> 01:39:29.109
Jesus Christ!

1801
01:39:29.199 --> 01:39:31.945
Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Fuck you!

1802
01:39:31.999 --> 01:39:35.579
Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!
I am sick of all your shit!

1803
01:39:37.079 --> 01:39:38.985
Ok, man. Ok.

1804
01:39:39.999 --> 01:39:41.401
Quit screwing around.

1805
01:39:41.425 --> 01:39:42.459
Take the wheel!
Oh, look at you!

1806
01:39:42.592 --> 01:39:43.778
Take the wheel!
Look at you!

1807
01:39:44.365 --> 01:39:45.563
You are fucking pathetic!

1808
01:39:45.729 --> 01:39:47.532
Why? Why? What are you talking about?

1809
01:39:47.848 --> 01:39:49.988
Why do you think I blew up your condo?

1810
01:39:51.704 --> 01:39:52.469
What?

1811
01:39:52.549 --> 01:39:54.664
Hitting bottom is not a weekend retreat.

1812
01:39:54.688 --> 01:39:56.397
It's not a goddamn seminar.

1813
01:39:57.059 --> 01:40:00.229
Stop trying to control everything
and just let go!

1814
01:40:03.475 --> 01:40:04.591
Let go!

1815
01:40:04.615 --> 01:40:05.775
Alright. Fine.

1816
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:08.142
Fine.

1817
01:41:07.499 --> 01:41:09.605
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I had never been in a car accident.</i></font>

1818
01:41:11.129 --> 01:41:13.454
<font color="#80ffff"><i>This must have been
what all those people felt like</i></font>

1819
01:41:13.479 --> 01:41:16.429
<font color="#80ffff"><i>before I filed them
as statistics in my reports.</i></font>

1820
01:41:17.219 --> 01:41:18.319
Goddamn!

1821
01:41:22.825 --> 01:41:24.825
We have just had a near life experience!

1822
01:41:30.609 --> 01:41:32.095
In the world I see,

1823
01:41:32.862 --> 01:41:35.489
you are stalking elk
through the Grand Canyon forests

1824
01:41:35.569 --> 01:41:38.279
around the ruins of Rockefeller Centre.

1825
01:41:40.482 --> 01:41:43.697
You will wear leather clothes
that will last you the rest of your life.

1826
01:41:45.209 --> 01:41:48.679
You will climb the great thick Kudzu vines
that wrap the Sears Tower.

1827
01:41:50.552 --> 01:41:54.392
And when you look down,
you will see tiny figures pounding corn,

1828
01:41:54.969 --> 01:41:56.467
laying strips of venison

1829
01:41:56.492 --> 01:42:00.152
in the empty car pool lane
of some abandoned superhighway.

1830
01:42:13.529 --> 01:42:14.955
Feel better, champion?

1831
01:42:33.709 --> 01:42:34.678
<font color="#80ffff"><i>And then...</i></font>

1832
01:42:35.209 --> 01:42:36.105
Tyler?

1833
01:42:36.719 --> 01:42:37.938
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Tyler was gone.</i></font>

1834
01:42:46.849 --> 01:42:48.161
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Was I asleep?</i></font>

1835
01:42:50.349 --> 01:42:51.630
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Had I slept?</i></font>

1836
01:42:51.809 --> 01:42:54.582
You are not a beautiful, unique snowflake,
you understand me?

1837
01:42:54.835 --> 01:42:56.962
<font color="#80ffff"><i>The house had become a living thing,</i></font>

1838
01:42:57.569 --> 01:43:00.909
<font color="#80ffff"><i>wet inside from so many people
sweating and breathing.</i></font>

1839
01:43:00.989 --> 01:43:02.569
We are all part
of the same compost heap...

1840
01:43:02.659 --> 01:43:04.892
<font color="#80ffff"><i>So many people moving, the house moved.</i></font>

1841
01:43:08.119 --> 01:43:09.312
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Planet Tyler.</i></font>

1842
01:43:09.919 --> 01:43:11.361
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I had to hug the walls,</i></font>

1843
01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:14.813
<font color="#80ffff"><i>trapped inside
this clockwork of space monkeys.</i></font>

1844
01:43:14.919 --> 01:43:16.324
You can't be smoking in here!

1845
01:43:16.377 --> 01:43:18.335
You know how much ether
is in this fucking house?

1846
01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:21.009
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Cooking and working
and sleeping in teams.</i></font>

1847
01:43:24.259 --> 01:43:25.623
Hang on a second.

1848
01:43:45.925 --> 01:43:47.425
It's under control, sir.

1849
01:43:50.459 --> 01:43:51.564
Where is Tyler?

1850
01:43:52.134 --> 01:43:54.934
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not...

1851
01:43:54.959 --> 01:43:56.573
Right. Ok.

1852
01:43:59.469 --> 01:44:00.969
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I am all alone.</i></font>

1853
01:44:01.709 --> 01:44:03.229
<font color="#80ffff"><i>My father dumped me.</i></font>

<font color="#80ffff"><i>Tyler dumped me.</i></font>

1855
01:44:05.662 --> 01:44:07.662
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I am Jack's broken heart.</i></font>

1856
01:44:12.185 --> 01:44:14.340
<font color="#80ffff"><i>What comes next in Project Mayhem</i></font>

1857
01:44:14.524 --> 01:44:15.895
<font color="#80ffff"><i>only Tyler knows.</i></font>

1858
01:44:16.706 --> 01:44:19.362
<font color="#80ffff"><i>The second rule is,
you do not ask questions.</i></font>

1859
01:44:22.609 --> 01:44:25.529
Get the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away from me!

1860
01:44:26.502 --> 01:44:27.988
Who are all these people?

1861
01:44:33.079 --> 01:44:34.672
The Paper Street Soap Company.

1862
01:44:37.879 --> 01:44:38.987
Can I come in?

1863
01:44:42.669 --> 01:44:43.965
He is not here.

1864
01:44:45.135 --> 01:44:46.015
What?

1865
01:44:47.679 --> 01:44:48.666
Tyler...

1866
01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:50.722
is not here.

1867
01:44:51.679 --> 01:44:53.265
Tyler went away.

1868
01:44:53.862 --> 01:44:54.965
Tyler is gone.

1869
01:45:11.659 --> 01:45:13.636
Jesus! Get some help!

1870
01:45:26.389 --> 01:45:28.569
Two gunshot wounds coming through!

1871
01:45:28.625 --> 01:45:30.115
Make some fucking room!

1872
01:45:30.855 --> 01:45:32.362
What happened? What happened?

1873
01:45:32.559 --> 01:45:33.849
We were on assignment.

1874
01:45:33.929 --> 01:45:36.280
We were supposed to kill
two birds with one stone.

1875
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:39.200
Destroy a piece of corporate art...

1876
01:45:40.088 --> 01:45:41.507
Operation Latte Thunder. Go!

1877
01:45:43.939 --> 01:45:45.859
And trash a franchise coffee bar.

1878
01:45:52.239 --> 01:45:53.779
We had it all worked out, sir.

1879
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:04.158
It went smooth until...

1880
01:46:04.182 --> 01:46:05.969
Police! Freeze!

1881
01:46:06.049 --> 01:46:06.786
What?

1882
01:46:07.892 --> 01:46:09.026
They shot Bob.

1883
01:46:10.429 --> 01:46:11.666
They shot him in the head.

1884
01:46:12.017 --> 01:46:13.012
Fucking pigs!

1885
01:46:18.509 --> 01:46:19.409
Oh, God!

1886
01:46:19.819 --> 01:46:21.384
Those motherfuckers!

1887
01:46:22.275 --> 01:46:23.895
You morons.

1888
01:46:24.279 --> 01:46:27.513
You run around in ski masks
trying to blow things up?

1889
01:46:27.538 --> 01:46:29.309
What did you think was gonna happen?

1890
01:46:33.119 --> 01:46:34.146
Ok, quick!

1891
01:46:34.409 --> 01:46:35.690
We gotta get rid of the evidence.

1892
01:46:35.714 --> 01:46:36.937
We gotta get rid of his body!

1893
01:46:36.962 --> 01:46:37.984
Bury him.

1894
01:46:38.475 --> 01:46:39.082
What?

1895
01:46:39.199 --> 01:46:41.282
Take him to the garden and bury him.

1896
01:46:42.434 --> 01:46:45.508
Come on, people, let's go!
Get the fuck off!

1897
01:46:45.533 --> 01:46:46.495
Get away from him!

1898
01:46:47.068 --> 01:46:48.249
What are you talking about?

1899
01:46:48.274 --> 01:46:50.204
This is not fucking piece of evidence.

1900
01:46:50.228 --> 01:46:51.215
This is a person.

1901
01:46:51.328 --> 01:46:54.594
He is a friend of mine and you are not
gonna bury him in the fucking garden!

1902
01:46:54.619 --> 01:46:57.441
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.

1903
01:46:57.466 --> 01:46:59.850
This is Bob.
But sir in...

1904
01:46:59.979 --> 01:47:02.229
In Project Mayhem, we have no names.

1905
01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:03.649
Now, you listen to me.

1906
01:47:03.729 --> 01:47:05.678
This is a man and he has a name,

1907
01:47:05.702 --> 01:47:07.305
and it's Robert Paulsen.

1908
01:47:07.329 --> 01:47:08.127
Ok?

1909
01:47:08.604 --> 01:47:09.684
Robert Paulsen?

1910
01:47:09.809 --> 01:47:12.110
He is a man,
and he is dead now because of us.

1911
01:47:12.135 --> 01:47:13.648
Alright? Do you understand that?

1912
01:47:14.941 --> 01:47:16.022
Yes.
I understand.

1913
01:47:18.579 --> 01:47:19.525
In death,

1914
01:47:20.432 --> 01:47:22.069
a member of Project Mayhem,

1915
01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:23.318
has a name.

1916
01:47:24.799 --> 01:47:26.538
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1917
01:47:27.669 --> 01:47:29.522
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1918
01:47:30.429 --> 01:47:31.329
His name...

1919
01:47:31.935 --> 01:47:33.299
is Robert Paulsen.

1920
01:47:34.259 --> 01:47:35.207
His name...

1921
01:47:35.535 --> 01:47:36.929
is Robert Paulsen.

1922
01:47:37.019 --> 01:47:40.229
Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1923
01:47:40.511 --> 01:47:42.875
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1924
01:47:43.098 --> 01:47:45.801
His name is Robert Paulsen.
Shut up! This is all over with!

1925
01:47:45.848 --> 01:47:47.707
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1926
01:47:47.793 --> 01:47:50.285
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1927
01:47:50.364 --> 01:47:52.809
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1928
01:47:52.856 --> 01:47:55.152
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1929
01:47:55.309 --> 01:47:57.340
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1930
01:47:57.575 --> 01:47:59.675

01:48:10.497 --> 01:48:12.497
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1936
01:48:21.059 --> 01:48:21.978
Tyler?

1937
01:48:22.189 --> 01:48:24.868
No, this is Detective Stern
of the Arson Unit.

1938
01:48:25.085 --> 01:48:26.585
<i>I need to see you in my office...</i>

1939
01:48:31.069 --> 01:48:34.016
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I went to all the cities
on Tyler's used ticket stubs,</i></font>

1940
01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:35.215
<font color="#80ffff"><i>bar hopping.</i></font>

1941
01:48:36.014 --> 01:48:37.404
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I didn't know how, of why</i></font>

1942
01:48:37.429 --> 01:48:40.534
<font color="#80ffff"><i>but I could look at 50 different bars,
and somehow I just knew.</i></font>

1943
01:48:40.714 --> 01:48:42.149
I am looking for Tyler Durden.

1944
01:48:42.173 --> 01:48:44.287
It's very important that I talk to him.

1945
01:48:45.039 --> 01:48:46.347
I wish I could help you,

1946
01:48:47.334 --> 01:48:48.120
sir.

1947
01:48:54.761 --> 01:48:56.212
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Every city I went to,</i></font>

1948
01:48:57.599 --> 01:48:59.836
<font color="#80ffff"><i>as soon as I set foot off the plane,</i></font>

1949
01:49:00.139 --> 01:49:02.109
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I knew a Fight Club was close.</i></font>

1950
01:49:03.259 --> 01:49:04.309
Hey! Hey!

1951
01:49:05.439 --> 01:49:06.599
Taxi!

1952
01:49:06.769 --> 01:49:08.477
Look at my face. I am a member.

1953
01:49:08.502 --> 01:49:11.169
Now, I just need to know
if you have seen Tyler.

1954
01:49:11.749 --> 01:49:13.222
I am not exposed to...

1955
01:49:13.815 --> 01:49:15.490
bespeak any such information to you,

1956
01:49:15.515 --> 01:49:18.811
nor would I, even if I had said information
you want at this juncture,

1957
01:49:18.961 --> 01:49:19.908
be able.

1958
01:49:21.789 --> 01:49:22.773
You are a moron.

1959
01:49:22.797 --> 01:49:24.289
I am afraid I have to ask you to leave.

1960
01:49:25.959 --> 01:49:27.361
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Tyler had been busy,</i></font>

1961
01:49:28.306 --> 01:49:31.049
<font color="#80ffff"><i>setting up franchises
all over the country.</i></font>

1962
01:49:33.839 --> 01:49:35.077
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Was I asleep?</i></font>

1963
01:49:36.541 --> 01:49:37.561
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Had I slept?</i></font>

1964
01:49:38.259 --> 01:49:40.969
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?</i></font>

1965
01:49:42.202 --> 01:49:44.615
We have just heard the stories.
What kind of stories?

1966
01:49:44.715 --> 01:49:46.380
Like nobody knows what he looks like.

1967
01:49:46.404 --> 01:49:49.248
He has facial reconstructive
surgery every three years.

1968
01:49:49.559 --> 01:49:51.689
That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.

1969
01:49:51.779 --> 01:49:53.637
Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?

1970
01:49:54.348 --> 01:49:56.303
Is Mr. Durden building an army?

1971
01:49:56.989 --> 01:50:00.119
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I was living in a state
of perpetual déjà vu.</i></font>

1972
01:50:00.989 --> 01:50:02.438
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Everywhere I went,</i></font>

1973
01:50:02.462 --> 01:50:04.159
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I felt I would already been there.</i></font>

1974
01:50:04.909 --> 01:50:07.291
<font color="#80ffff"><i>It was like following an invisible man.</i></font>

1975
01:50:08.829 --> 01:50:10.821
<font color="#80ffff"><i>The smell of dried blood.</i></font>

1976
01:50:11.999 --> 01:50:14.681
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Dirty, bare footprints circling each other.</i></font>

1977
01:50:15.049 --> 01:50:17.969
<font color="#80ffff"><i>That aroma of old sweat,
like fried chicken.</i></font>

1978
01:50:18.832 --> 01:50:22.304
<font color="#80ffff"><i>The feel of a floor still warm
from a fight the night before.</i></font>

1979
01:50:23.198 --> 01:50:25.739
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I was always just one step behind Tyler.</i></font>

1980
01:50:28.769 --> 01:50:30.674
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1981
01:50:31.237 --> 01:50:33.135
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1982
01:50:33.419 --> 01:50:34.295
His...

1983
01:50:36.859 --> 01:50:38.211
Welcome back, sir.

1984
01:50:39.989 --> 01:50:41.059
How have you been?

1985
01:50:42.779 --> 01:50:43.825
Do you know me?

1986
01:50:44.869 --> 01:50:46.148
Is this a test, sir?

1987
01:50:46.432 --> 01:50:48.129
No. This is not a test.

1988
01:50:49.539 --> 01:50:51.166
You were here last Thursday.

1989
01:50:52.379 --> 01:50:53.212
Thursday?

1990
01:50:54.169 --> 01:50:58.339
You were standing exactly where you are now,
asking how good security is.

1991
01:50:58.879 --> 01:51:00.301
It's tight as a drum, sir.

1992
01:51:03.049 --> 01:51:04.457
Who do you think I am?

1993
01:51:05.719 --> 01:51:07.461
Are you sure this is not a test?

1994
01:51:07.797 --> 01:51:09.411
No, this is not a test.

1995
01:51:10.979 --> 01:51:12.317
You are Mr. Durden.

1996
01:51:13.569 --> 01:51:15.794
You are the one who gave me this.

1997
01:51:16.989 --> 01:51:20.821
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Please return your seat backs
to their full upright and locked position.</i></font>

1998
01:51:32.499 --> 01:51:34.127
Yeah?
<i>Marla, it's me.</i>

1999
01:51:34.307 --> 01:51:35.406
Have we ever done it?

2000
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:36.334
<i>Done what?</i>

2001
01:51:36.414 --> 01:51:37.741
Have we ever had sex.

2002
01:51:38.039 --> 01:51:39.653
What kind of stupid question is that?

2003
01:51:39.678 --> 01:51:42.284
Is it stupid because the answer is yes
or because the answer is no?

2004
01:51:42.719 --> 01:51:43.706
Is this a trick?

2005
01:51:43.730 --> 01:51:44.919
<i>No, Marla. I need to know...</i>

2006
01:51:44.944 --> 01:51:47.459
You mean you want to know if I think
we were just having sex

2007
01:51:47.483 --> 01:51:48.864
or making love?

2008
01:51:49.389 --> 01:51:50.754
We did make love?

2009
01:51:50.778 --> 01:51:52.117
<i>Is that what you are calling it?</i>

2010
01:51:52.269 --> 01:51:55.734
Just answer the question, Marla, please!
Did we do it or not?

2011
01:51:55.759 --> 01:51:57.136
You fuck me, then snub me.

2012
01:51:57.160 --> 01:51:58.540
You love me, you hate me.

2013
01:51:58.565 --> 01:52:01.310
You show me your sensitive side,
then you turn into a totally asshole.

2014
01:52:01.335 --> 01:52:04.005
Is that a pretty accurate description
of our relationship, Tyler?

2015
01:52:04.449 --> 01:52:06.529
<font color="#80ffff"><i>We have just lost cabin pressure.</i></font>

2016
01:52:06.699 --> 01:52:07.855
What did you just say?

2017
01:52:07.879 --> 01:52:08.740
What is wrong with you?

2018
01:52:08.765 --> 01:52:10.149
What did you just call me? Say my name!

2019
01:52:10.254 --> 01:52:11.260
Tyler Durden.

2020
01:52:11.285 --> 01:52:13.499
<i>Tyler Durden, you fucking freak!
What's going on?</i>

2021
01:52:13.861 --> 01:52:15.901
I am coming over!
No wait, Marla, I am not there!

2022
01:52:18.081 --> 01:52:19.341
You broke your promise.

2023
01:52:20.482 --> 01:52:22.569
Jesus, Tyler.
You fucking talked to her about me.

2024
01:52:22.642 --> 01:52:24.417
Tyler, what the fuck is going on here?

2025
01:52:24.442 --> 01:52:26.081
I ask you for one thing.

2026
01:52:26.388 --> 01:52:27.800
One simple thing.

2027
01:52:27.825 --> 01:52:29.282
Why do people think that I am you?

2028
01:52:30.679 --> 01:52:31.718
Answer me!

2029
01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:36.925
Sit.

2030
01:52:40.529 --> 01:52:42.906
Answer me. Why do people
think that I am you?

2031
01:52:43.819 --> 01:52:45.013
I think you know.

2032
01:52:45.766 --> 01:52:47.739
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.

2033
01:52:47.829 --> 01:52:50.509
Why would anyone
possibly confuse you with me?

2034
01:52:52.289 --> 01:52:53.549
I... I don't know.

2035
01:52:58.499 --> 01:52:59.531
You got it.

2036
01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:00.664
No.

2037
01:53:00.769 --> 01:53:03.212
Do not fuck with us!
Say it.

2038
01:53:04.879 --> 01:53:05.865
Because...

2039
01:53:08.009 --> 01:53:09.047
Say it!

2040
01:53:11.345 --> 01:53:12.880
Because we are the same person.

2041
01:53:13.769 --> 01:53:14.849
That's right.

2042
01:53:14.939 --> 01:53:17.265
<i>We are the all singing, all dancing...</i>

2043
01:53:17.609 --> 01:53:19.093
I don't understand this.

2044
01:53:19.117 --> 01:53:21.089
You were looking for a way
to change your life.

2045
01:53:21.399 --> 01:53:23.162
You could not do this on your own.

2046
01:53:23.826 --> 01:53:25.599
All the ways you wish you could be,

2047
01:53:26.356 --> 01:53:27.459
that's me.

2048
01:53:28.119 --> 01:53:29.436
I look like you wanna look,

2049
01:53:29.688 --> 01:53:30.739
I fuck like you wanna fuck,

2050
01:53:30.764 --> 01:53:31.689
I am smart,

2051
01:53:31.713 --> 01:53:33.274
capable and most importantly,

2052
01:53:33.772 --> 01:53:35.732
I am free in all the ways that you are not.

2053
01:53:35.959 --> 01:53:36.898
Oh, no.

2054
01:53:37.144 --> 01:53:38.988
Tyler's not here. Tyler went away.

2055
01:53:39.012 --> 01:53:40.314
Tyler's gone.
What?

2056
01:53:40.339 --> 01:53:41.448
This is not possible.

2057
01:53:41.472 --> 01:53:43.033
No, this is crazy.

2058
01:53:43.170 --> 01:53:44.457
People do it every day.

2059
01:53:44.839 --> 01:53:46.120
They talk to themselves.

2060
01:53:46.144 --> 01:53:48.309
They see themselves as they'd like to be.

2061
01:53:48.719 --> 01:53:50.332
They don't have
the courage you have,

2062
01:53:50.356 --> 01:53:51.592
to just run with it.

2063
01:53:55.099 --> 01:53:57.089
Naturally you are still wrestling with it, so...

2064
01:53:57.268 --> 01:53:58.884
sometimes you are still you.

2065
01:53:58.909 --> 01:54:00.559
We should do this again sometime.

2066
01:54:00.875 --> 01:54:03.142
Other times,
you imagine yourself watching me.

2067
01:54:03.255 --> 01:54:05.939
This is your first night in fight club,
you have to fight.

2068
01:54:06.029 --> 01:54:07.266
Little by little,

2069
01:54:08.142 --> 01:54:09.699
you are just letting yourself become...

2070
01:54:12.034 --> 01:54:12.829
Tyler Durden.

2071
01:54:13.060 --> 01:54:14.690
You are not your job,

2072
01:54:14.714 --> 01:54:16.459
or how much money you have to fight!

2073
01:54:16.869 --> 01:54:18.789
No. You have a house.
Rented in your name.

2074
01:54:18.814 --> 01:54:20.622
You have jobs, you have a whole life.

2075
01:54:20.646 --> 01:54:22.394
You have night job because you can't sleep.

2076
01:54:22.419 --> 01:54:24.074
Or you stay up and make soap.

2077
01:54:24.098 --> 01:54:25.874
Molly you are fucking Marla, Tyler.

2078
01:54:26.339 --> 01:54:27.995
Technically, you are fucking Marla.

2079
01:54:28.019 --> 01:54:29.378
But it's all the same to her.

2080
01:54:31.549 --> 01:54:32.892
Oh, my God.

2081
01:54:33.929 --> 01:54:35.418
Now you see our dilemma.

2082
01:54:36.599 --> 01:54:37.998
She knows too much.

2083
01:54:39.472 --> 01:54:42.682
I think we are gonna have to talk about
how this might compromise our goals.

2084
01:54:44.779 --> 01:54:45.980
What... What are you saying?

2085
01:54:47.109 --> 01:54:48.682
This is... This is bullshit.

2086
01:54:49.540 --> 01:54:51.247
This is bullshit!
I am not listening to this.

2087
01:54:51.380 --> 01:54:52.770
You are insane!
No.

2088
01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:54.100
You are insane.

2089
01:54:54.289 --> 01:54:56.990
And we simply
do not have time for this crap.

2090
01:54:59.169 --> 01:55:00.663
<font color="#80ffff"><i>It's called a changeover.</i></font>

2091

2092
01:55:02.930 --> 01:55:05.209
<font color="#80ffff"><i>and nobody in the audience has any idea.</i></font>

2093
01:55:18.979 --> 01:55:19.922
Sir!

2094
01:55:19.946 --> 01:55:20.964
Are you checking out?

2095
01:55:21.575 --> 01:55:22.790
Yeah. Bill me.

2096
01:55:22.815 --> 01:55:25.425
I need you to initial
this list of phone calls, please.

2097
01:55:29.649 --> 01:55:30.724
When were these made?

2098
01:55:30.748 --> 01:55:33.629
It says right there, sir.
Between 2:00 and 3:30 this morning.

2099
01:55:38.829 --> 01:55:40.943
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Have I been going to bed earlier

2103
01:55:51.679 --> 01:55:52.879

2105

<font color="#80ffff"><i>all over again.</i></font>

2106
01:55:59.349 --> 01:56:02.389
Yeah, with enough soap,
one could blow up just about anything.

2107
01:56:05.149 --> 01:56:06.349
Oh, my God.

2108
01:56:10.359 --> 01:56:12.359
<i>1888.</i>
Who am I calling?

2109
01:56:12.779 --> 01:56:15.212
<i>1888 Franklin. This is maintenance.</i>

2110
01:56:16.579 --> 01:56:17.479
<i>Hello?</i>

2111
01:56:18.539 --> 01:56:19.410
<i>Hello?</i>

2112
01:56:19.435 --> 01:56:21.055
1888 Franklin Street?

2113
01:56:22.039 --> 01:56:22.860
<i>Yes.</i>

2114
01:56:23.276 --> 01:56:24.391
<i>Can I help you?</i>

2115
01:56:26.589 --> 01:56:27.406
<i>Hello?</i>

2116
01:56:28.279 --> 01:56:29.345
Yeah, yeah.

2117
01:56:29.709 --> 01:56:31.702
I need to talk to your supervisor
right away.

2118
01:56:32.024 --> 01:56:32.786
<i>Speaking.</i>

2119
01:56:32.810 --> 01:56:33.882
Ok, listen to me.

2120
01:56:34.009 --> 01:56:36.929
I think something really terrible is about
to happen to your building.

2121
01:56:36.954 --> 01:56:38.422
You have got...
<i>It's under control, sir.</i>

2122
01:56:39.849 --> 01:56:40.919
Excuse me?

2123
01:56:40.943 --> 01:56:42.463
<i>Don't worry about us, sir.</i>

2124
01:56:42.489 --> 01:56:43.502
<i>We are solid.</i>

2125
01:56:47.319 --> 01:56:48.399
<i>2160.</i>

2126
01:56:56.829 --> 01:56:59.621
Marla! Marla! Hey, Marla, wait!

2127
01:57:00.734 --> 01:57:02.649
Marla, wait! I gotta talk to you!

2128
01:57:02.793 --> 01:57:03.989
Marla! Marla!

2129
01:57:04.014 --> 01:57:06.434
Your whack out bald freaks hit me
with a fucking broom!

2130
01:57:06.459 --> 01:57:08.354
I know, I am sorry. I kinda warn you...
They almost broke my arm!

2131
01:57:08.379 --> 01:57:10.099
They were burning their finger tips with lye.

2132
01:57:10.129 --> 01:57:11.241
The stink was unbelievable.

2133
01:57:11.265 --> 01:57:12.039
Look, look, listen to me.

2134
01:57:12.064 --> 01:57:15.041
It will take a tremendous act of faith
on your part, but you gotta hear me out.

2135
01:57:15.066 --> 01:57:16.663
Ok, here comes an avalanche of bullshit.

2136
01:57:16.946 --> 01:57:18.505
A little more faith than that.

2137
01:57:22.979 --> 01:57:25.138
Well listen, I don't wanna hear
anything you have to say.

2138
01:57:25.163 --> 01:57:26.483
You have every right to be...

2139
01:57:27.963 --> 01:57:29.255
I will just have a coffee, thanks.

2140
01:57:29.525 --> 01:57:32.025
Sir, anything you order is free of charge, sir.

2141
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:34.389
Why is it free of charge?

2142
01:57:34.413 --> 01:57:35.779
Don't, don't, don't ask.

2143
01:57:35.989 --> 01:57:36.918
Whatever.

2144
01:57:37.319 --> 01:57:38.999
I will have the clam chowder,

2145
01:57:39.024 --> 01:57:41.754
the fried chicken with a baked potato
with everything and chocolate chiffon pie.

2146
01:57:42.461 --> 01:57:43.754
Clean food, please.

2147
01:57:44.459 --> 01:57:47.311
In that case sir, may I advise against
the lady eating the clam chowder.

2148
01:57:47.336 --> 01:57:49.108
No clam chowder. Thank you.

2149
01:57:52.144 --> 01:57:53.456
You got about 30 seconds.

2150
01:57:56.007 --> 01:57:57.980
I know that I have been acting
very very strange,

2151
01:57:58.271 --> 01:57:59.024
ok?

2152
01:57:59.187 --> 01:58:01.291
I... I know that it's gotta seem
like there is two sides

2153
01:58:01.315 --> 01:58:02.251
to me when you with...
Two sides?

2154
01:58:02.275 --> 01:58:03.886
You are Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jackass.

2155
01:58:03.953 --> 01:58:05.003
I deserved that but...

2156
01:58:05.027 --> 01:58:07.373
look I have come to realise
something very very important.

2157
01:58:07.527 --> 01:58:08.293
What?

2158
01:58:08.439 --> 01:58:10.551
The full extent of our relationship
was not really...

2159
01:58:10.758 --> 01:58:12.058
clear to me up until now,

2160
01:58:12.083 --> 01:58:14.205
for reasons I am not gonna go into.
But the important things are...

2161
01:58:14.230 --> 01:58:16.698
I know I have not been treating you so nice.
Yeah, whatever.

2162
01:58:16.723 --> 01:58:18.908
No, no, no, no.
15 seconds, 15 seconds, please!

2163
01:58:18.948 --> 01:58:20.941
Please 15 seconds,
don't open your mouth to me.

2164
01:58:21.449 --> 01:58:23.315
I am trying to tell you that I am sorry.

2165
01:58:23.659 --> 01:58:25.148
Because what I have come to realize,

2166
01:58:25.492 --> 01:58:27.291
is that I really like you, Marla.

2167
01:58:29.499 --> 01:58:30.320
You do?

2168
01:58:30.444 --> 01:58:31.585
I really do.

2169
01:58:32.049 --> 01:58:35.765
I care about you and I don't want anything
bad to happen to you because of me.

2170
01:58:36.549 --> 01:58:37.369
Marla,

2171
01:58:37.393 --> 01:58:39.479
your life is in danger.

2172
01:58:41.009 --> 01:58:41.790
What?

2173
01:58:41.814 --> 01:58:43.627
You need to leave town for a while.

2174
01:58:44.087 --> 01:58:46.637
Get out of any major city.
And just go camping or something...

2175
01:58:46.662 --> 01:58:48.059
You are an insane person.

2176
01:58:48.084 --> 01:58:50.004
No, no. I have involved you in
something terrible.

2177
01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:51.091
That's about to happen...
No.

2178
01:58:51.175 --> 01:58:52.387
You are not...
Shut up!

2179
01:58:52.412 --> 01:58:53.578
Safe.
Shut up!

2180
01:58:56.755 --> 01:58:58.223
Listen, I tried Tyler.

2181
01:58:58.722 --> 01:58:59.850
I really tried.

2182
01:58:59.874 --> 01:59:00.902
I know you did.

2183
01:59:00.989 --> 01:59:02.519
There are things about you I like.

2184
01:59:02.849 --> 01:59:04.563
You are smart, you are funny,

2185
01:59:04.900 --> 01:59:06.346
you are spectacular in bed.

2186
01:59:06.885 --> 01:59:07.608
But...

2187
01:59:08.379 --> 01:59:09.608
you are intolerable.

2188
01:59:10.024 --> 01:59:12.362
You have very serious emotional problems,

2189
01:59:13.051 --> 01:59:15.115
deep-seeded problems
for which you should seek,

2190
01:59:15.139 --> 01:59:16.533
professional help.
I know.

2191
01:59:16.557 --> 01:59:17.618
And I, I am sorry.

2192
01:59:17.642 --> 01:59:19.577
You are sorry, I am sorry,
everyone is sorry but...

2193
01:59:21.429 --> 01:59:22.890
I can't do this anymore.

2194
01:59:24.259 --> 01:59:25.083
I can't.

2195
01:59:25.773 --> 01:59:26.723
I won't.

2196
01:59:28.599 --> 01:59:29.590
I am gone.

2197
01:59:30.928 --> 01:59:32.105
You can't leave, Marla!

2198
01:59:32.129 --> 01:59:33.138
You are not safe!

2199
01:59:36.689 --> 01:59:38.615
Marla, wait you got to understand!
No, leave me alone!

2200
01:59:38.715 --> 01:59:41.090
Marla, I am trying to protect you!
Just go. Look, just go away.

2201
01:59:41.115 --> 01:59:42.976
I don't ever want to see you again!
That's fine.

2202
01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:44.069
If that's what it takes...

2203
01:59:44.449 --> 01:59:45.363
Hey wait, wait right here.

2204
01:59:50.192 --> 01:59:52.792
Hold it right there! Shut up! Shut up!

2205
01:59:53.209 --> 01:59:54.321
Take this money

2206
01:59:54.465 --> 01:59:57.841
and get on this bus. And I promise you I will
never bother you again if that's what you want.

2207
01:59:57.919 --> 01:59:59.019
Shut up!

2208
01:59:59.299 --> 02:00:00.494
Please get on the bus.

2209
02:00:00.871 --> 02:00:02.259
Please get on the bus.

2210
02:00:03.799 --> 02:00:05.165
Why are you doing this?

2211
02:00:05.189 --> 02:00:06.937
Because they think you
are some kind of a threat.

2212
02:00:06.962 --> 02:00:09.063
I... I can't explain it right now.
Just trust me.

2213
02:00:09.088 --> 02:00:10.937
If I see where you are going,
you will not be safe.

2214
02:00:10.962 --> 02:00:12.381
I am not paying this back.

2215
02:00:12.405 --> 02:00:13.788
I consider it asshole tax.

2216
02:00:13.813 --> 02:00:17.504
That's fine. Remember, stay out of major cities
for at least a couple of days.

2217
02:00:17.529 --> 02:00:18.589
Ok?
Tyler...

2218
02:00:20.426 --> 02:00:22.549
You are the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

2219
02:00:37.692 --> 02:00:38.532
Hello.

2220
02:00:39.085 --> 02:00:40.459
I need you to arrest me.

2221
02:00:40.734 --> 02:00:43.134
I am the leader
of a terrorist organization,

2222
02:00:43.222 --> 02:00:45.747
responsible for numerous acts
of vandalism,

2223
02:00:45.771 --> 02:00:47.334
and assault all over this city.

2224
02:00:48.171 --> 02:00:49.751
In the metropolitan area,

2225
02:00:49.775 --> 02:00:51.631
we had probably
a couple hundred members.

2226
02:00:52.179 --> 02:00:54.047
Chapters have sprung up in

2227
02:00:54.071 --> 02:00:56.345
five or six other major cities already.

2228
02:00:56.399 --> 02:00:59.492
This is a tightly regimented organization

2229
02:00:59.585 --> 02:01:03.834
with many cells capable of operating
completely independent of central leadership.

2230
02:01:05.402 --> 02:01:06.852
Look, go to the house, ok?

2231
02:01:06.876 --> 02:01:09.034
1537 Paper Street.

2232
02:01:09.449 --> 02:01:10.943
That's our headquarters.

2233
02:01:11.359 --> 02:01:13.650
In the back, buried in the garden,

2234
02:01:14.176 --> 02:01:16.199
you will find the body of Robert Paulsen.

2235
02:01:17.650 --> 02:01:18.822
In the basement,

2236
02:01:18.846 --> 02:01:20.212
you are gonna find some bathtubs

2237
02:01:20.237 --> 02:01:24.164
that have been used very recently
to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.

2238
02:01:25.589 --> 02:01:27.038
I believe the plan is...

2239
02:01:27.695 --> 02:01:30.349
is to blow up the headquarters
of these credit-card companies

2240
02:01:30.429 --> 02:01:32.109
and the TRW building.

2241
02:01:33.979 --> 02:01:35.422
Why these buildings?

2242
02:01:35.446 --> 02:01:37.349
Why credit-card companies?

2243
02:01:37.921 --> 02:01:40.974
If you erase the debt record then
we all go back to zero.

2244
02:01:42.301 --> 02:01:43.847
You will create total chaos.

2245
02:01:46.892 --> 02:01:49.279
Keep him talking.
I need to make a phone call.

2246
02:02:00.008 --> 02:02:01.564
I really admire what you are doing.

2247
02:02:03.379 --> 02:02:04.201
What?

2248
02:02:04.611 --> 02:02:06.345
You are a brave man to order this.

2249
02:02:07.049 --> 02:02:08.452
You are a genius, sir.

2250
02:02:09.162 --> 02:02:13.162
You said if anyone ever interferes
with Project Mayhem, even you,

2251
02:02:14.059 --> 02:02:15.850
we gotta get his balls.

2252
02:02:16.729 --> 02:02:17.923
It's useless to fight.

2253
02:02:17.947 --> 02:02:19.995
It's really a powerful gesture, Mr. Durden.

2254
02:02:20.536 --> 02:02:23.844
It will set quite an example.
You are making a big mistake! Fellas.

2255
02:02:23.869 --> 02:02:26.067
You said you would say that.
I am not Tyler Durden!

2256
02:02:26.092 --> 02:02:27.617
You told us you would say that too.

2257
02:02:28.659 --> 02:02:30.370
Alright. I am Tyler Durden.

2258
02:02:30.850 --> 02:02:31.895
Listen to me.

2259
02:02:31.919 --> 02:02:33.419
I am giving you a direct order.

2260
02:02:33.772 --> 02:02:35.652
We are aborting
this mission right now.

2261
02:02:35.762 --> 02:02:37.618
You said you would definitely say that.

2262
02:02:39.959 --> 02:02:40.987
Let me go!

2263
02:02:41.983 --> 02:02:42.724
Hold on.

2264
02:02:42.942 --> 02:02:45.805
Are you fucking out of your minds?
You are police officers!

2265
02:02:48.219 --> 02:02:49.512
Is somebody timing this?
Oh no, no.

2266
02:02:49.537 --> 02:02:52.472
No. No.
Keep your mouth shut.

2267
02:02:52.849 --> 02:02:53.929
Shit!

2268
02:02:57.067 --> 02:02:57.753
Yeah!

2269
02:02:57.778 --> 02:03:00.380
Hey, you know,
some of this information checks out.

2270
02:03:01.105 --> 02:03:03.301
Let's go over to that house on Paper Street.

2271
02:03:03.478 --> 02:03:04.599
Be right there.
Ok.

2272
02:03:05.189 --> 02:03:06.092
Hey, wait!

2273
02:03:06.439 --> 02:03:07.689
You got him?
I got him.

2274
02:03:07.965 --> 02:03:09.585
Sir, we have to do this, Mr Durden.

2275
02:03:09.725 --> 02:03:12.085
Stop fighting!
Where is the rubber band?

2276
02:03:12.149 --> 02:03:13.353
Get away from me!

2277
02:03:13.377 --> 02:03:15.025
Drop that fucking knife! Drop it!

2278
02:03:18.562 --> 02:03:19.317
Back up.

2279
02:03:20.014 --> 02:03:21.860
Face down on the floor,
both of you right now!

2280
02:03:24.335 --> 02:03:25.593
Get down on the floor!

2281
02:03:30.469 --> 02:03:32.998
First person comes out
this fucking door gets a...

2282
02:03:33.022 --> 02:03:34.742
gets a lead salad! You understand?

2283
02:03:59.409 --> 02:04:01.522
Get away! Stay away!

2284
02:04:14.469 --> 02:04:15.456
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I ran.</i></font>

2285
02:04:17.139 --> 02:04:21.019
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I ran until my muscles burned
and my veins pumped battery acid.</i></font>

2286
02:04:23.769 --> 02:04:25.285
<font color="#80ffff"><i>Then I ran some more.</i></font>

2287
02:05:07.359 --> 02:05:09.010
What the fuck are you doing,

2288
02:05:09.305 --> 02:05:10.652
running around in your underpants?

2289
02:05:10.719 --> 02:05:12.345
Man, you look like a crazy person.

2290
02:05:12.485 --> 02:05:13.807
No. I am onto you.

2291
02:05:13.831 --> 02:05:15.172
I know what is going on here.

2292
02:05:15.604 --> 02:05:18.186
Come on, then. I got us a great place
to watch from.

2293
02:05:19.148 --> 02:05:20.351
It will be like pay-per-view.

2294
02:06:09.238 --> 02:06:10.169
Oh, Christ.

2295
02:06:10.249 --> 02:06:11.524
Now what are you doing?

2296
02:06:12.169 --> 02:06:13.366
I am stopping this.

2297
02:06:13.557 --> 02:06:14.426
Why?

2298
02:06:14.799 --> 02:06:16.536
The greatest thing you have ever done, man.
No,

2299
02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:17.862
I can't let this happen.

2300
02:06:18.679 --> 02:06:20.866
You know there are 10 other bombs
in 10 other buildings.

2301
02:06:21.170 --> 02:06:23.673
Goddamn it! Since when is Project Mayhem
about murder?

2302
02:06:23.853 --> 02:06:24.961
The buildings are empty.

2303
02:06:24.985 --> 02:06:26.779
Security, maintenance, all our people.

2304
02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:28.850
We are not killing anyone, man.
We are setting them free!

2305
02:06:29.239 --> 02:06:30.341
Bob is dead.

2306
02:06:30.365 --> 02:06:31.729
They shot him in the head.

2307
02:06:32.359 --> 02:06:34.439
You wanna make an omelet,
you gotta break eggs.

2308
02:06:34.775 --> 02:06:36.431
No. I am not listening to you.

2309
02:06:36.455 --> 02:06:37.839
You are not even there.

2310
02:06:45.199 --> 02:06:46.441
Would not do that.

2311
02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:48.607
Not unless I knew which wires were what.

2312
02:06:49.209 --> 02:06:50.606
If you know, then I know.

2313
02:06:56.509 --> 02:06:57.410
Or...

2314
02:06:57.747 --> 02:07:00.937
maybe I knew you would know, so I spent
the whole day thinking about the wrong ones.

2315
02:07:09.729 --> 02:07:10.840
You think?

2316
02:07:12.399 --> 02:07:14.240
Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.

2317
02:07:15.222 --> 02:07:16.773
Pull any one but the green one.

2318
02:07:22.579 --> 02:07:24.359
I asked you not to do that!

2319
02:07:27.559 --> 02:07:28.192
Fuck!

2320
02:07:29.882 --> 02:07:31.412
Tyler, get away from the van.

2321
02:07:34.265 --> 02:07:35.698
Tyler, I am not kidding!

2322
02:07:36.102 --> 02:07:37.495
Get away from the van!

2323
02:07:37.969 --> 02:07:39.231
Goddamn it!

2324
02:07:46.019 --> 02:07:46.908
Ok.

2325
02:07:47.521 --> 02:07:50.479
You are now firing a gun
at your imaginary friend

2326
02:07:50.559 --> 02:07:53.229
near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!

2327
02:07:55.569 --> 02:07:57.098
Cool it, Tyler! Tyler!

2328
02:08:00.669 --> 02:08:01.656
God!

2329
02:08:11.385 --> 02:08:12.235
Come on.

2330
02:08:12.505 --> 02:08:13.575
Don't go!

2331
02:08:52.598 --> 02:08:53.325
What?

2332
02:09:39.169 --> 02:09:40.448
Three minutes.

2333
02:09:40.908 --> 02:09:42.089
This is it.

2334
02:09:43.248 --> 02:09:44.328
The beginning.

2335
02:09:45.455 --> 02:09:46.509
Ground zero.

2336
02:09:46.878 --> 02:09:48.759
<font color="#80ffff"><i>I think this is about where we came in.</i></font>

2337
02:09:48.945 --> 02:09:50.978
Would you like to say a few words
to mark the occasion?

2338
02:09:54.099 --> 02:09:55.084
I am sorry?

2339
02:09:55.388 --> 02:09:57.262
I still can't think of anything.

2340
02:09:59.901 --> 02:10:01.161
Flashback humour.

2341
02:10:06.779 --> 02:10:08.383
It's getting exciting now.

2342
02:10:10.369 --> 02:10:11.604
Two and a half.

2343
02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:13.839
Think of everything
we have accomplished, man.

2344
02:10:15.924 --> 02:10:19.499
Out these windows, we will view
the collapse of financial history.

2345
02:10:20.206 --> 02:10:22.482
One step closer to economic equilibrium.

2346
02:10:37.809 --> 02:10:38.965
Why is she here?

2347
02:10:39.275 --> 02:10:40.557
Tying up loose ends.

2348
02:10:41.269 --> 02:10:44.050
Put me down, you bald headed fuck!

2349
02:10:44.779 --> 02:10:46.597
I am begging you, please don't do this.

2350
02:10:46.621 --> 02:10:49.060
I am not doing this. We are doing this.

2351
02:10:49.239 --> 02:10:50.494
This is what we want.

2352
02:10:50.518 --> 02:10:52.512
No. I don't want this.

2353
02:10:52.615 --> 02:10:54.355
Right. Except you...

2354
02:10:54.578 --> 02:10:55.815
is meaningless now.

2355
02:10:55.839 --> 02:10:57.301
We have to forget about you.

2356
02:10:58.268 --> 02:10:59.902
You are a voice in my head.

2357
02:10:59.926 --> 02:11:01.107
You are a voice in mine!

2358
02:11:01.247 --> 02:11:02.995
You are a fucking hallucination.

2359
02:11:03.020 --> 02:11:04.816
Why can't I get rid of you?
You need me.

2360
02:11:04.955 --> 02:11:07.089
No. I don't. I really don't anymore.

2361
02:11:07.114 --> 02:11:08.355
Hey, you created me.

2362
02:11:08.482 --> 02:11:11.204
I didn't create some loser alter ego
to make me feel better.

2363
02:11:11.709 --> 02:11:13.709
Take some responsibility.
I do.

2364
02:11:14.169 --> 02:11:17.349
I am responsible for all of it,
and I accept that.

2365
02:11:17.612 --> 02:11:19.464
So, please, I am begging you,

2366
02:11:19.827 --> 02:11:21.299
please call this off.

2367
02:11:23.768 --> 02:11:25.238
Have I ever let us down?

2368
02:11:27.539 --> 02:11:29.275
How far have you come because of me?

2369
02:11:35.409 --> 02:11:37.062
I will bring us through this.

2370
02:11:37.665 --> 02:11:38.900
As always,

2371
02:11:39.198 --> 02:11:41.625
I will carry you kicking and screaming,

2372
02:11:41.751 --> 02:11:42.737
and in the end,

2373
02:11:42.761 --> 02:11:44.018
you will thank me.

2374
02:11:44.249 --> 02:11:45.239
Tyler.

2375
02:11:45.691 --> 02:11:46.749
Tyler.

2376
02:11:46.879 --> 02:11:48.117
I am grateful to you

2377
02:11:48.524 --> 02:11:50.384
for everything that you have done for me.

2378
02:11:50.839 --> 02:11:52.080
But this is too much.

2379
02:11:52.377 --> 02:11:53.482
I don't want this.

2380
02:11:53.535 --> 02:11:54.499
What do you want?

2381
02:11:54.655 --> 02:11:56.167
You wanna go back to your shit job?

2382
02:11:56.256 --> 02:11:58.204
Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?

2383
02:11:58.415 --> 02:12:00.222
Fuck you! I won't do it.

2384
02:12:00.575 --> 02:12:02.632
Oh my God, this can't be happening.

2385
02:12:03.482 --> 02:12:05.241
It's already done, so shut up!

2386
02:12:05.862 --> 02:12:07.595
60 seconds till CRI.

2387
02:12:08.185 --> 02:12:08.908
No.

2388
02:12:10.899 --> 02:12:12.225
I can figure this out.

2389
02:12:12.249 --> 02:12:14.085
I can figure this out.
This is not even real.

2390
02:12:14.359 --> 02:12:15.812
You are not real. That gun is...

2391
02:12:16.495 --> 02:12:18.039
That gun is not even in your hand.

2392
02:12:19.362 --> 02:12:20.702
The gun's in my hand.

2393
02:12:27.169 --> 02:12:29.049
Hey good for you.
That doesn't change a thing.

2394
02:12:38.285 --> 02:12:40.081
Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?

2395
02:12:41.639 --> 02:12:43.035
Not my head, Tyler.

2396
02:12:43.849 --> 02:12:44.942
Our head.

2397
02:12:47.399 --> 02:12:48.535
Interesting.

2398
02:12:52.526 --> 02:12:54.372
Where are you going with this, Ikea boy?

2399
02:13:01.501 --> 02:13:02.150
Hey?

2400
02:13:03.026 --> 02:13:04.227
It's you and me.

2401
02:13:07.959 --> 02:13:08.941
Friends?

2402
02:13:10.709 --> 02:13:11.618
Tyler,

2403
02:13:15.665 --> 02:13:17.217
I want you to really listen to me.

2404
02:13:18.752 --> 02:13:19.497
Ok.

2405
02:13:21.949 --> 02:13:23.397
My eyes are open.

2406
02:13:41.119 --> 02:13:42.724
What's that smell?

2407
02:14:03.559 --> 02:14:04.754
Where is everybody?

2408
02:14:04.778 --> 02:14:06.412
Oh, no. What's going on?

2409
02:14:07.399 --> 02:14:08.512
Mr. Durden!

2410
02:14:09.269 --> 02:14:10.459
Oh, my God!

2411
02:14:11.779 --> 02:14:12.665
Sir!

2412
02:14:16.279 --> 02:14:17.433
Are you...

2413
02:14:18.112 --> 02:14:19.449
Are you alright, sir?

2414
02:14:19.869 --> 02:14:21.270
Oh, yeah, I am ok.

2415
02:14:21.294 --> 02:14:23.443
You look terrible, sir. What happened?

2416
02:14:23.909 --> 02:14:25.650
Oh, nothing, it's no problem.

2417
02:14:25.674 --> 02:14:27.883
No, no, no, sir. He is not kidding.

2418
02:14:27.908 --> 02:14:29.111
You look really awful.

2419
02:14:29.135 --> 02:14:31.014
You need medical assistance.
I am fine.

2420
02:14:31.799 --> 02:14:32.949
Look, I am fine.

2421
02:14:33.406 --> 02:14:34.692
Everything's fine.

2422
02:14:37.932 --> 02:14:39.219
Eat my shit.

2423
02:14:39.432 --> 02:14:40.665
Let her go.

2424
02:14:40.783 --> 02:14:41.986
Christ Almighty!

2425
02:14:42.639 --> 02:14:43.618
You!

2426
02:14:44.639 --> 02:14:45.732
Hi, Marla.

2427
02:14:47.479 --> 02:14:48.714
Leave her with me.

2428
02:14:48.738 --> 02:14:50.550
Get your stuff. Meet me downstairs.

2429
02:14:50.574 --> 02:14:51.596
Are you sure?

2430
02:14:51.728 --> 02:14:53.136
Yes, I am sure.

2431
02:14:55.149 --> 02:14:56.335
You fucker!

2432
02:14:56.482 --> 02:14:58.590
What kind of sick fucking game
are you playing at,

2433
02:14:58.614 --> 02:14:59.430
putting me on a fucki...

2434
02:14:59.455 --> 02:15:01.468
Oh, my God, your face!

2435
02:15:01.869 --> 02:15:02.928
Yeah, I know.

2436
02:15:08.829 --> 02:15:09.860
What happened?

2437
02:15:10.129 --> 02:15:11.039
Don't ask.

2438
02:15:11.129 --> 02:15:12.238
You are shot.

2439
02:15:12.262 --> 02:15:13.282
Yes, I am shot.

2440
02:15:13.449 --> 02:15:14.411
Oh, my God.

2441
02:15:15.308 --> 02:15:16.867
I can't believe he is standing.

2442
02:15:16.891 --> 02:15:18.648
One tough motherfucker.

2443
02:15:22.639 --> 02:15:23.817
Who did this?

2444
02:15:24.719 --> 02:15:26.244
I did actually.

2445
02:15:27.059 --> 02:15:28.430
Find some gauze.

2446
02:15:30.399 --> 02:15:32.008
You shot yourself?

2447
02:15:32.032 --> 02:15:33.301
Yes, but it's ok.

2448
02:15:33.325 --> 02:15:34.578
Marla, look at me.

2449
02:15:34.879 --> 02:15:36.151
I am really ok.

2450
02:15:37.965 --> 02:15:39.181
Trust me.

2451
02:15:39.545 --> 02:15:40.965
Everything's gonna be fine.

2452
02:15:54.129 --> 02:15:56.709
You met me at a very strange time in my life.
