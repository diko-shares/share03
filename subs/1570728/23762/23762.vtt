1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,400
- Are we home?
- I think so.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,910
I wanted a family, so that's
what the house made for me.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,650
Jules, he's in the house.

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,069
You're not supposed to be here!

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,449
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- You followed us out?

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,669
Don't you want to find some way

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,559
where we can still be a family?

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,079
Well, there's a guaranteed way to get him

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,259
back inside the House.

10
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,640
It's if you go with him.

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,680
I'm not stepping foot back in that place.

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,380
Margot!

13
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,460
No more. Please, I'll go! I'll go!

14
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,460
You're starving.

15
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,840
I can wait another day.

16
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,470
It's been long enough.

17
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,920
It's okay. I wrote it down.

18
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,060
There was this lake that we
would go to in the summer.

19
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:56,010
And when the light started to go away,

20
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,460
we would walk out into this big field,

21
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,590
and we would look for UFOs.

22
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,770
And you would say,

23
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,990
"It's getting dark.

24
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,730
It's time to go home."

25
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,860
You picked up an apple and said,

26
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,000
if ever an apple just like this.

27
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,420
"Rolls out of the lake,

28
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,440
"Don't take a bite.

29
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,740
The fish might be fishing for us."

30
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,470
What was that?

31
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,970
A few afternoons.

32
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,730
Hey. You were looking for me?

33
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,080
Yeah. You've been going
on a lot of walks lately.

34
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,390
Yeah. I was just trying to clear my head.

35
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,890
You know they're suffering. It's not fair.

36
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,430
Well, I don't have anything
left to feed them.

37
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,220
I already gave them everything
I don't want to remember.

38
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,440
I just got so dizzy.

39
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
What?

40
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,570
What?

41
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,570
Wait... that wasn't there before.

42
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,600
The world just rearranged itself.

43
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,280
So, the house showed up somewhere new?

44
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,850
Somewhere they speak French.

45
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,570
How'd you hear about this place?

46
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,960
My friends came last year.

47
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,480
Everybody's like, "It'll change your life!"

48
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,580
Hey, Jules.

49
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,470
You can relax.

50
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,870
It's not gonna come while you're with me.

51
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,420
Whatever it is, it likes to
get you alone, doesn't it?

52
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,370
Yeah. I figured it might've
starved to death by now.

53
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,400
No. They don't starve to death.

54
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,290
Not while their food
source is still out there.

55
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,480
They just hungrier and hungrier.

56
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,890
- You have to be careful.
- Wait.

57
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,500
- I'm just trying to help you.
- Don't.

58
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,220
Whatever it is...

59
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,140
Don't.

60
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,380
Whatever it is,

61
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,950
it hasn't eaten in so long
that if it does get you...

62
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,610
it's gonna take everything.

63
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,940
So, just...

64
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,210
Just keep your eyes open, all right?

65
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,569
Wait. This... this wasn't on the way

66
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,680
from the NoEnd House to Margot's last time.

67
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,050
Yeah, well, it is now,

68
00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:43,770
'cause everything got changed around.

69
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,520
It's only a couple blocks away.

70
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,939
It's a little close for
comfort... believe me...

71
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,770
But I... you know, not really my call.

72
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,210
What?

73
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:09,650
What you don't understand is
that this house is an organism.

74
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,670
It has instincts.

75
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,130
It has an appetite.

76
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,410
It has a will to survive.

77
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,920
And the more I understand it,

78
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,960
the more I admire it.

79
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,410
I wish you would, too.

80
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,930
What is that? A sales pitch?

81
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,809
You sound psychotic, okay?

82
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,089
And I'm not buying

83
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,710
whatever it is that you're selling.

84
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,029
I came here to get Margot out,

85
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,930
and that is exactly what I am going to do,

86
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,650
so fu... you, and fu... the House!

87
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,930
Now take me to her.

88
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,410
All right.

89
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,610
All right.

90
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,110
Another walk?

91
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,310
Yeah. Everything's different now.

92
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,240
You hungry?

93
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,370
I was thinking about something.

94
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,150
Yeah?

95
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,460
We should close the door.

96
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,290
What do you mean?

97
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,090
Well, to the House.

98
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,830
Popped up somewhere new out
there to lure people in,

99
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,929
and... lock the door, or bar it,
or set the house on fire.

100
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,069
Whatever this thing is, it's...

101
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,870
It's evolved into it, so I just...

102
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,989
I... I don't know if
it's gonna be that easy.

103
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,480
But what if it is? We should at least try

104
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,329
so people don't come in and...

105
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,330
No!

106
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,770
No.

107
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,840
Motherfu... er.

108
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,700
Come here.

109
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,130
Come closer.

110
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,070
Come closer.

111
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,810
Touch her.

112
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,330
What are you?

113
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,190
Some psychological tumor?

114
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,160
What does it matter?

115
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,260
I'm not the same person.

116
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,489
Hey, um, just tried you
a couple times already.

117
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,190
Just wanted to see how
orientation is going.

118
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,049
I just really need you right now,

119
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,840
so if you could give me a call...

120
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,880
Margot?

121
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,920
Touch me.

122
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,749
Just call me, Jules! Hey...

123
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,569
I know you want to, so I'm
giving you permission

124
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,450
to run away... you're really
fu... ing good at it!

125
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,740
I'm sure you're busy with
your new life or whatever.

126
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,350
Give me a call. I know you want to,

127
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,069
so I'm giving you permission to run away!

128
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,070
You're really fu... ing good at it!

129
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,210
- Give me a call.
- Jules.

130
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,750
Jules?

131
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,150
What are you doing?

132
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,770
I'm still thinking about closing the door.

133
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,130
You know what I think?

134
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,020
What?

135
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,370
I think you care about other people

136
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,290
more than you care about yourself.

137
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,530
Trust me.

138
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,110
I know you.

139
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,540
I can see the real you.

140
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,520
You can always count on one thing...

141
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,360
As long as you're here, I will always,

142
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,720
always be there for you.

143
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,530
Come on. Let's go inside.

144
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,450
Let me out!

145
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,370
Let me out!

146
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,920
Is Seth coming back soon?

147
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,630
John?

148
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,430
Yes?

149
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,689
Listen. Margot's got this
really crazy idea in her head.

150
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,320
I'm a little worried.

151
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,630
Is it crazy?

152
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,829
I just don't think it's a
good idea to do anything

153
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,219
here that, you know, could
upset the ecosystem.

154
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,560
You know what I mean?

155
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,130
No, not really.

156
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,990
I'm worried that she's gonna
try and do something stupid

157
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,429
like burn the house down or something.

158
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,289
I... I... and, you know, that doesn't work.

159
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,210
I've seen people try it.

160
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,399
Keeping other people from
getting trapped in here

161
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,160
sounds like a pretty good idea to me.

162
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,680
Well, no, it's not.

163
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,099
I mean, if the House doesn't eat,

164
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,099
then... I don't know.

165
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,689
It might die.

166
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,509
And you... you're a part of the House,

167
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,820
so I'm just trying to look out for you.

168
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,500
I'm gonna die anyway.

169
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,679
Margot's gonna get hollowed out,

170
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,550
so she might as well be dead.

171
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,400
And as for you,

172
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,120
well, we all have to make
sacrifices, now, don't we?

173
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,210
Do you remember me?

174
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,280
Yeah. You're literally the
last thing I'd ever forget.

175
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,500
What happened?

176
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,960
I'm here to take you home.

177
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,740
Margot?

178
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,680
What?

179
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,390
Um, well, it's not that easy.

180
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,039
Yes, Margot. Yes, it is.

181
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,400
Come on. Let's go.

182
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,870
And we got to go now.

183
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,580
No, Jules. I live here.

184
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,090
I... I would have to...

185
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,660
What? Tell them? No.

186
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,370
This is a prison break, Margot.

187
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,750
Look. I don't remember out there.

188
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,949
I mean, I know it exists,

189
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,949
but it's just this big, dark thing.

190
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:27,040
I remember you, and I remember
the two people in this house.

191
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,740
Margot, I have to show you something.

192
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,240
Okay. What?

193
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,530
Come on.

194
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,730
Come on.

195
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,570
No. Come on. Let's go.

196
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,520
Margot?

197
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,090
Margot!

198
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,110
What are we doing here?

199
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,720
There's something you
need to know about Seth.

200
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,200
Who's here?

201
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,470
Who are you?

202
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:08,209
She's another you. Seth brought her here,

203
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,500
and he let the House hollow her out.

204
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,610
How long has she been in the House?

205
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,690
She doesn't even know she's
in the NoEnd House anymore.

206
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,660
What are you guys talking about?

207
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,210
Is Seth coming back soon?

208
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:41,750
Pretty soon, you'll be
just as hollow as she is.

209
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,300
And then he'll replace you, too.

210
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:02,170
Margot, are you gonna come home now?

211
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,310
You're coming with me now, right?

212
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,460
Right?

213
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:08,930
Let's go.

214
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,670
Let's go!

215
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,580
All right. I know what I have to do.

216
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,470
You're gonna wait here.

217
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,560
Okay? Okay.

218
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,079
Wait. Where are you going?

219
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,260
Wait here.

220
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,500
- I thought...
- You thought what?

221
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,080
What's going on?

222
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,580
You tell me.

223
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:20,510
You're gonna have to be a
little more helpful than that.

224
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,240
Who lives here?

225
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,270
You met her?

226
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,100
I met something that used to be a person.

227
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,630
We came in in the same group.

228
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,619
She didn't last very long. She was young.

229
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,640
There's less memories to steal.

230
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,409
I swear to God, Margot,

231
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,100
I just come to check on her sometimes.

232
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,340
So you came in together.

233
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,330
Margot, look at you. You're all worried.

234
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,470
Your dad and I want you to come home.

235
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,520
Remember,

236
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,770
as long as you're here...

237
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:20,550
I'll be there for you.

238
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,439
I promise, Martian.

239
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,870
Don't touch me!

240
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,760
Seth?

241
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,540
Seth?

242
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,000
Are you all right?

243
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,790
You're here for Margot.

244
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,100
That's right.

245
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,640
And you think that if I'm out of the way,

246
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,790
that it'll be easier for you
to get her to go with you.

247
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,720
You're right.

248
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:54,930
Do it.

249
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,940
I know what I am.

250
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,160
And I have no problem with not existing.

251
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,710
I guess I haven't been totally honest.

252
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,890
Seth, these are people...

253
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,089
Like me, that went into that house

254
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,710
and never came out.

255
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,180
You know, sometimes...

256
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,979
Sometimes I think you don't recognize

257
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,330
how special this place is.

258
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,560
Yeah, maybe I keep forgetting.

259
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,199
You know, honestly, I
feel like I'm seeing you

260
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,289
for the first time, and you're
not who I thought you were.

261
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:51,090
No. Don't say that.

262
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,200
I'm what I always told you I was.

263
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,699
I'm someone that has
never belonged anywhere

264
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,589
until this place took me in,

265
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,590
and it saved me.

266
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,669
It's one thing for you to
figure out how to live here,

267
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,360
and it's another thing for
you to take other people

268
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,570
and feed them to a house every year.

269
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,420
A house?

270
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,630
A house?

271
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,280
God! I keep waiting

272
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:21,340
for one of you to understand

273
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:24,680
how magnificent this place is!

274
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,260
All the gifts that it can give you!

275
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:34,390
Because memory is a disease!

276
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,429
And then this house is the cure!

277
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,860
How can you not see that?

278
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,930
But if you don't want to use it...

279
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:54,630
Maybe you're not who I thought you were.

280
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:00,890
Maybe you are just like everybody else.

281
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,060
Disappointing.

282
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,850
Well, if memory's a
disease, then what's love?

283
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,590
An infection?

284
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,480
I did love you.

285
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,760
I still do love you.

286
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,770
I just loved them first.

287
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,249
Yeah, until the House
turned them into husks

288
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:35,120
and you put them back in their boxes.

289
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,880
All right. Well, I'm not a serial killer.

290
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:43,710
I'm just a serial monogamist.

291
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,410
They're not mutually exclusive.

292
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,830
Grow up, Margot.

293
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,350
You're not some helpless little girl.

294
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,900
No, I'm not.

295
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,470
Margot, come on.

296
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,410
Margot.

297
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,710
Let's go home.

298
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,170
Margot! Margot!

299
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,530
Margot!

300
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:33,539
No! No! No!

301
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,229
No, Margot! No!

302
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,709
Margot, no!

303
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,999
No! Please! Margot!

304
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,159
Margot, no!

305
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,049
No! No!

306
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,749
No! No!

307
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:47,729
No! No!

308
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:50,180
No! No!

309
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,080
No! No!

310
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,310
Thank you.

311
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,570
I wanted to protect you.

312
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,110
I know.

313
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:24,960
You ready to go?

314
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,670
Yeah, I'm ready.
