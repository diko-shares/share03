Dad, dad!

3
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,114
Bring a bucket o f water, son.
There's no time to lose.

4
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,038
This watch is unique.

5
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,429
Take it eas y.

6
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,553
Dad, when will the watch be ready?

7
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,557
How many times must l ask you not to
shout, while l'm speaking on the phone.

8
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,838
lt must soak in sweet water
for 2 4 hours.

9
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,556
Then we must find new parts.

10
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,870
lt's difficult to say...

11
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,236
Dad! His ship is leaving tonight.

12
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,229
One moment, one moment.

13
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,835
Don't yell while l'm on the phone!

14
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,270
lf he wants to take the ruined parts
with him, he can. l won't stop him.

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,994
Mas o minos

17
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,714
Boatswain!

18
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,755
Lyrvang!

19
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,154
Kare Lyrvang!

20
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,429
Where did you come from?

21
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,996
Shit!
lt had to be a Norwegian!

22
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,752
Almar.

00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,112

24
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,791
-C afe.
-Grac ias.

25
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,358
l hope the fellow
doesn't get pissed o ff.

26
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,630
lt will ruin the business.

27
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,679
Up with your chin,
hold it that way.

28
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,074
Keep your mouths shut!

29
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,073
lt's not finished yet.

30
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,748
lt doesn't matter.

31
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,953
But it isn't finished!

32
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,395
Me? Do l have a gold tooth?
Or side burns.

33
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,634
l won't pay for it.

34
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,915
l won't argue anymore.
Give me the money and it's okey.

35
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,274
C erveza.

36
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,435
Grac ias.

37
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,955
Sailor?

38
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,239
Dad!
He is asking for his watch.

39
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,037
l guess you're in a hurry now.

40
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,920
How can l make you understand-

41
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,713
-that this watch is the result-

42
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,277
-o f many centuries o f research.

43
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,553
Years o f work,

44
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,072
The anchor is broken.

45
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,831
But you do not know-

46
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,151
-what an anchor is.
Do you sailor?

47
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,873
l have to get one from a colleague-

48
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,640
-in Santiago de Compostela.

49
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,638
Maybe he'll find one. We must try.

50
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,591
That's what we are here for.

51
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,878
Hey, boy s! How are you?

52
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,400
Excuse me, but l've just been eating.

53
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,032
l've got gas.

54
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,639
Almar doesn't understand spanish.
He is a Norwegian sailor.

55
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,757
A Norwegian sailor!
Terrific!

56
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,158
l used to be a sailor my self,
on a Norwegian whaler.

57
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,077
Will you translate, Windy?
l don't remember any Norwegian.

58
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,192
The captain's name-

59
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,192
The captain's name-

60
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,310
-was Olsen something.

61
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,835
The chie f engineer's name was-

62
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,393
-Ola.

63
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,070
We were great friends.

64
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,910
When we parted i Durban he gave
me a calypso record.

65
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,157
Norwegian calypso, dammit!

66
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,439
''A gay...

67
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,800
...calypso in springtime''

68
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,192
Ola alway s put it on,
when he was a little drunk.

69
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,277
The tit...the tit l've had...

70
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,953
-is my life and nourishment-

71
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,998
-and if Molina sings for me-

72
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,474
-sings that he's a miner.

73
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,353
Almar.

74
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,190
You're rested. Why don't you go
to the kitchen and get us some beers,-

75
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,279
-while we finish.

76
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,151
Come on, Windy. Almar.

77
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,195
They must be cold, really cold.

78
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,393
Bring three.

79
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,239
Hey, boy s!

80
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,515
What are you doing here
without food and drink? Windy!

81
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,272
Yes, o f course.

82
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,590
Tonight we'll go out to sea.

83
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,191
l like crab fishing...

84
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,396
...when l've cut my hair.

85
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,357
You will never understand
the flamenco, Windy.

86
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,708
You whoring bastard!

87
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,799
Uncle Alberto! Here is the part we've
been looking for.

88
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,719
Now he's asleep again.

89
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,399
He's had a long trip from Santiago.

90
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,036
Son, take his glass away from him,
so that he won't break it once more.

91
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,916
Sailor, look here.

92
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,553
This part is a pre fect match.

93
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,395
l'm thirsty.

94
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,990
Somebody has taken my glass.

95
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,669
Yes, yes-

96
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,389
-someone has taken your glass.

97
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,510
Jesus, turn on the music,
so that everybody doesn't leave again!

98
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,429
What the hell is it?

99
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,317
The boy is ill.

100
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,959
The part doesn't arrive.

101
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,310
Maybe tomorrow. Take it eas y.

102
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,312
l see. But the watch
is not leaving this store!

103
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,157
ls that so damned
difficult to understand?!''

104
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,154
l am not a swindler, if you think so.

105
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,228
l'm a watchmaker.
Look here.

106
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,075
This is my certificate.

107
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,555
Wait, take it eas y.

108
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,237
This is my father's certificate.

109
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,832
l just want you to understand-

110
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,556
-that soul o f the men
who made this watch-

111
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,753
-is in every stone-

112
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,833
- every cogwheel and spring.

113
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,670
They put all their time into this.

114
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,271
But l just want my watch back.

115
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,315
Chie f!
Red wine!

116
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,031
When you pay what you owe me!

117
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,309
But, the ham...

118
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,071
You have at least been
drinking a whole pig!

119
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:05,113
A bottle o f your best house wine.

120
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,435
Make it fast.

121
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:10,951
Can't you wait a second.
l just sat down!

122
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,238
Manana otro dia.

123
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:21,795
Octopus!

124
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,956
Octopus, o f course.

125
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,313
How are you today, boy s?

126
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,073
Dammit, what happened, Molina?

127
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,836
Some men came and told me
that the rope was theirs.

128
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,350
l told them that l didn't
know anything about it.

129
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,630
Take it eas y, Windy,
l'm prepared now!

130
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,520
What the hell is it?

131
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,873
A gun!

132
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,640
Stay away from them-

133
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:56,279
-they are liable to do anything!

134
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,475
So am l

135
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:01,433
May l keep the car
a while longer?

136
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:06,033
Yes, but don't say or
do anything stupid. Neither must you.

137
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:08,156
No, no, don't you worry.

138
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,436
Damned shit in hell!

139
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,917
Damned shit in hell
Marta
