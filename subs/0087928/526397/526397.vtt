00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.406
Hello...

2
00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:03.951
...Tackleberry.

3
00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:10.378
We're all gonna miss you around here.

4
00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:13.540
The Police Academy's getting itself
a real fine recruit.

5
00:02:16.345 --> 00:02:18.086
May I, uh...

6
00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:20.008
...go now?

7
00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:22.799
Affirmative, sir.

8
00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.055
Ten-four.

9
00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:29.438
Yes, of course. Ten-four.

10
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:48.893
You guys.

11
00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:51.812
Surprise.

12
00:03:55.736 --> 00:03:57.193
Lot's full, mister.

13
00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:01.568
Look, don't give me that crap.

14
00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:04.655
- You've got a space.
- The lot's full, sir, really.

15
00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:07.070
Find a spot, dickhead.

16
00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:10.244
- Dickhead?
- That's right. Where's the manager?

17
00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:11.578
Dickhead?

18
00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:13.835
Park the car, butt breath.

19
00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:16.166
- Butt breath?
- Yeah.

20
00:04:17.174 --> 00:04:20.338
Wait a minute. Hold everything.
That's a wig, isn't it?

21
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.718
- Ahem. Park the car.
- Yeah, that's a wig.

22
00:04:22.888 --> 00:04:25.301
Wig! Wig! Dong-dong-dong!

23
00:04:25.474 --> 00:04:28.262
- Wig alert! Wig alert! Dong-dong-dong!
- Park the car, asshole. Shut up.

24
00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:30.222
Girls. It's a rug.

25
00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.974
What the hell's going on here? Hi, Lou.

26
00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:36.645
- Lou?
- This rude little punk won't park my car.

27
00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:38.525
Mahoney, park this car.

28
00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.027
If you can find a spot--

29
00:04:40.197 --> 00:04:43.361
Do it now or you're fired.
You understand? Fired.

30
00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:46.822
Fired? That's not fair,
the guy has a bad attitude.

31
00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:48.406
Do it, okay?

32
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.449
I want you to apologize to this man,
then park his car.

33
00:04:54.503 --> 00:04:56.210
Yes, sir.

34
00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.540
- I'm sorry.
- Get out of here.

35
00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:02.629
And clean the ashtray while you're at it.

36
00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:12.098
Yeah, I'm sorry, Lou. You just can't get
good help these days.

37
00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.560
--respect for anything.
They don't respect customers.

38
00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:19.601
They don't respect property.
They don't respect respect.

39
00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:23.487
Holy shit. Jesus.

40
00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:33.073
It fits. Damn thing fits.

41
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.664
I thought there were no more spaces.
Am I an idiot or what?

42
00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:44.379
Hi, fellas.

43
00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:54.639
Hey, guys, just--

44
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.187
Hey, hey!

45
00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:15.661
Guys, I don't think I'm supposed
to get the photos wet.

46
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.424
You're going to pay for this.
Mark my words.

47
00:06:28.597 --> 00:06:31.715
And you want to know why? Huh?

48
00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:39.646
I'll let you know why. It's no secret.
Everybody knows.

49
00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:42.149
I'm joining the police force. Ha, ha!

50
00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.481
What do you think of that, huh? Huh?

51
00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:46.111
Now who's in charge?

52
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.822
Hey, sarge, it's him again.

53
00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:58.457
I'll call Captain Reed.
Sit over there, Mahoney.

54
00:06:58.627 --> 00:07:00.289
All right, let's go.

55
00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:07.458
Sit. And stay there.

56
00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:21.480
- What are you in for?
- I'll show you.

57
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:28.528
Goddamn it! Stop that!

58
00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:30.155
Oh, no, sir. No, not you.

59
00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:32.066
That's terrific. Really.

60
00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:36.371
- What's your name?
- Jones. Larvell Jones.

61
00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:38.952
Monsignor Larvell Jones.

62
00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:40.206
M.D.

63
00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:42.494
- Let's go, Mahoney.
- See you around, monsignor.

64
00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:45.038
Doctor monsignor.

65
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.388
Why can't you stay out of trouble?

66
00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:00.185
I mean...

67
00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:04.565
What's wrong with you?
Last week: disturbing the peace.

68
00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:08.398
Week before that:
destroying private property.

69
00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:12.235
And I'm getting tired of saving your butt.

70
00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:16.201
I only do it because of your father.

71
00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:20.535
- He was a good friend.
- Yeah, I know.

72
00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:23.247
Now, Mahoney, I've made a decision.

73
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.787
I ain't gonna help you this time.

74
00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:28.832
You're going to the county lockup.

75
00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:30.875
- Lockup?
- Mm-hm.

76
00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:35.012
Why? I didn't do anything really major.

77
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.969
- Then I'll make a deal with you.
- Anything.

78
00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:40.977
I want you to go to the Police Academy.

79
00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:42.933
The Police Academy?

80
00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:46.144
Even if you never graduate,
the training will be good for you.

81
00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:47.853
Wait a minute.

82
00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:49.985
Wait a minute. Reed?

83
00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:53.694
Listen, you've seen the commercials on TV.

84
00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:57.653
The Academy's taking all kinds these days.

85
00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:00.447
Anybody can get in.

86
00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:02.873
Even you.

87
00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.371
No deal. That's nuts.

88
00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:08.288
Well, it's either that or the lockup.

89
00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:12.129
- Police Academy or jail.
- Will I get my own squad car?

90
00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:15.966
You'll get 14 weeks of Academy training
and discipline...

91
00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:19.223
- ...starting Monday morning.
- Fourteen weeks.

92
00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:21.600
Oh, they can throw you out.

93
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.683
But you can't quit.
You quit, and you're back in jail.

94
00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:26.939
That's the deal.

95
00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:29.434
- Can I bring a friend?
- Who?

96
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:31.728
Monsignor Larvell Jones,
my personal physician.

97
00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:34.734
You decide.

98
00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:39.073
Honey, please don't go. I love you.
I don't want to see you hurt.

99
00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:41.487
I worry about you.
You're so accident-prone.

100
00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:44.122
And the Police Academy
is such a dangerous place.

101
00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:47.706
- Honey, don't worry. I'll be okay.
- Unh!

102
00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:49.245
Everything'll be okay.

103
00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:51.789
You start that car
and you're a dead man, buster.

104
00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:53.332
Honey, I'm late.

105
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:57.845
You pull out of that driveway
and I'll have your head on a pole.

106
00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:02.926
Come back here, you turkey!

107
00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:37.339
You move this car an inch
and you're finished, mister. You hear me?

108
00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:49.393
Of all the things that you could be
in this world, why a policeman?

109
00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:52.730
A policewoman, mother.

110
00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:55.148
But why?

111
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.483
Because it's exciting, it's different.

112
00:10:57.657 --> 00:11:00.240
It'll give me a chance to meet
interesting and unusual people.

113
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.402
--right now! If you don't pull over--

114
00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:05.162
People who aren't like you and me.

115
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.617
- Hey, look, it's the chief.
- Really?

116
00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:53.456
Hey, mention my name.

117
00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:00.588
Cadet Kyle Blankes reporting for duty, sir.

118
00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:02.879
Get away from me, you asshole.

119
00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:04.388
Yes, sir.

120
00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:26.114
- Where are we, man?
- Ecuador.

121
00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:34.456
Okay! Oh, here we are.
I got to go now. Bye.

122
00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:37.793
- Bye, sweet-pea. Bye, cutie-pie.
- We'll miss you.

123
00:12:37.966 --> 00:12:40.333
- Okay.
- Bye!

124
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:44.049
Okay, girls. Remember, I love yous.

125
00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:47.010
- Bye!
- Introduce yourself around, man.

126
00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:53.475
Bye! Bye, babies. Goodbye.

127
00:12:54.857 --> 00:12:55.893
Hey, excuse me.

128
00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:57.683
- Do you know all those women?
- Sure.

129
00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.601
- They're my girlfriends.
- All of them?

130
00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.566
- Yeah.
- Carey Mahoney.

131
00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:03.230
I'm George Martin, Carey.

132
00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:05.570
We should be pals.
You're an interesting guy.

133
00:13:05.743 --> 00:13:07.200
You a cadet?

134
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.487
I am until I can get myself
thrown out of here.

135
00:13:09.664 --> 00:13:10.700
I'll be gone by 10:00.

136
00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:13.365
You, like, joined the Academy
to get thrown out?

137
00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:14.579
That's right.

138
00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:17.495
Hey, you're a pretty interesting guy
yourself.

139
00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.672
Look at that.

140
00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:31.638
Just look at that.

141
00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:35.855
Look at that scum.
When I went through this academy...

142
00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:38.892
...every cadet was the right weight,
the right height, color...

143
00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:41.606
...and they all had Johnsons, Lassard.

144
00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:43.941
Every single one of them.

145
00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:45.151
Johnsons?

146
00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:47.567
You know...

147
00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:50.493
Oh, yes.

148
00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:55.541
Back in the old days, there were Johnsons
as far as the eye could see.

149
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.578
And what a lovely sight it was.

150
00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:01.918
Have you seen these applications?

151
00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:07.295
Have you seen what our new lady mayor
has brought us?

152
00:14:07.472 --> 00:14:09.589
Do you know she is attempting
to dismantle...

153
00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:13.180
...one of this country's great institutions
of law and order?

154
00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:15.766
What do you say to that, Lassard?

155
00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:17.938
The bitch.

156
00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:21.149
- Commandant?
- Yes, chief.

157
00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:24.938
The mayor says we've got
to take this flotsam.

158
00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:28.778
But that doesn't mean
we have to put them on the force.

159
00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:30.738
You get my drift?

160
00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:34.451
Weed the undesirables out.

161
00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:37.116
- Get rid of them.
- No problem, chief.

162
00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:39.205
We'll start washing them out this morning.

163
00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:41.086
We don't throw them out.

164
00:14:41.255 --> 00:14:44.589
They must be encouraged to quit
on their own.

165
00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:48.753
- Do you understand?
- I think I understand, sir.

166
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.423
Thank you, Lieutenant Harris,
I'm sure you do.

167
00:14:53.684 --> 00:14:55.220
- Lassard?
- What?

168
00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:57.557
Do you understand?

169
00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.723
- It's clear as glass, chief.
- Good.

170
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.608
Then we all know what to do.

171
00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:31.545
That's it...

172
00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:35.640
There sure are a lot of spades around here.

173
00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:45.268
Which I think is good.

174
00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:47.607
Very good for the Academy.

175
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.488
What the hell are you doing here?

176
00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:53.734
I want to be a police officer.

177
00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:57.871
What? I can't hear you.

178
00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:02.368
I want to be a police officer.

179
00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:07.172
- Don't unpack.
- Well...

180
00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:09.207
...time to get thrown out.

181
00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:13.132
Princess. Princess! Prin--!

182
00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:17.057
- What's your name, Cadet?
- Thompson, sir.

183
00:16:17.226 --> 00:16:18.842
- You live around here?
- No, sir.

184
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.932
What's your telephone number,
Thompson?

185
00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:23.392
Come on, eyes front. Telephone number.

186
00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:25.899
5-5-5 2-4-6-7, sir.

187
00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:28.981
Okay, let's see the thighs.

188
00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:33.240
Come on, come on. I haven't got all day.
The thighs.

189
00:16:34.869 --> 00:16:37.987
- What in the hell are you doing?
- Meeting women, sir.

190
00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:40.622
What's your name, dirtbag?

191
00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:42.874
- Dirtbag?
- Your name?

192
00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:44.706
Mahoney, sir.

193
00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:46.120
Back in line, Mahoney.

194
00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:49.540
Sir, can I have a second with you?
Um, listen. Uh...

195
00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:51.800
I don't really belong here.
I'm not right for this.

196
00:16:51.969 --> 00:16:56.555
Get back in line.

197
00:16:57.683 --> 00:16:59.424
Now!

198
00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:04.101
Mom, it's all right. Don't worry.
Come here, Princess.

199
00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:38.969
My name is Commandant Lassard.
Welcome to the new police force.

200
00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:42.263
Your training time here will last...

201
00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:44.970
<i>Fourteen.</i>

202
00:17:45.147 --> 00:17:47.104
...fourteen weeks.

203
00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:51.565
You will be schooled in firearms,
police procedures, local laws...

204
00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:53.603
...and many, many other things.

205
00:17:53.781 --> 00:17:57.149
After those 12 weeks,
some of you will be police officers...

206
00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:58.908
...and some of you will not.

207
00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:00.319
Some of you will be--

208
00:18:02.164 --> 00:18:03.700
Here at the Academy...

209
00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:06.788
Here at the Academy...

210
00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:08.748
...you will learn...

211
00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:10.537
You will learn...

212
00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:13.082
Princess. Princess. Come here.

213
00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:15.546
Princess?
Looks more like a prince to me.

214
00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:20.301
- Give me that dog.
- Uh-- Ahem. But he's mine, sir.

215
00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:21.681
He's a queer.

216
00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:26.437
Cadets, proceed to the supply room
and draw your uniforms.

217
00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:30.725
Fall out. Let's go. Move it.
Move it, move it, move it.

218
00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:38.653
- Next.
- What about guns? When do we get guns?

219
00:18:38.826 --> 00:18:40.317
Next.

220
00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:44.371
- I'm a size 9, sometimes a size 10.
- Next.

221
00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:56.417
Hey! You three dirtbags report
to the Academy barber...

222
00:18:56.594 --> 00:18:58.085
...before you do anything else.

223
00:18:58.262 --> 00:18:59.673
Where's that?

224
00:18:59.847 --> 00:19:02.260
Find it, rat face.

225
00:19:02.433 --> 00:19:03.799
Rat face?

226
00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:06.889
- He probably meant the other guy.
- Oh. Oh, okay.

227
00:19:07.063 --> 00:19:09.146
- What's that?
- That's where the commandant...

228
00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:11.398
- ...and his wife live.
- Nice.

229
00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:13.980
Oh. Excuse me.
Do you know where we get our clothes?

230
00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:17.237
Yeah. You gotta go right over there.

231
00:19:17.406 --> 00:19:18.897
- Here? Okay, thanks.
- Mm-hm.

232
00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:22.113
- Go in and tell them Mahoney sent you.
- Got it.

233
00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:25.992
- Be out of here by 3:00.
- Move it, dirtbag. I'm first.

234
00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:28.248
And I'm next.

235
00:19:29.126 --> 00:19:32.790
For important guys like you, I'll wait.

236
00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:39.085
Okay, let's go. Take it all off.

237
00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:40.468
You got it.

238
00:19:57.071 --> 00:19:58.152
Hello?

239
00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:32.313
- Ah. Just a little off the side, please.
- You bet.

240
00:20:32.481 --> 00:20:36.816
- You can do that?
- Sure. This ain't the Army, you know.

241
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:45.826
Let's go, let's go! We've got to find
you little babies a place to sleep.

242
00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:48.703
Better listen up, you fart-blossoms.

243
00:20:48.873 --> 00:20:52.708
- You sure you said Mahoney?
- Yeah, I even spelled it to her.

244
00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:54.584
- Copeland and Blankes, in here.
- Sir.

245
00:20:54.754 --> 00:20:57.667
This man is my personal physician.
I can't live without him, sir.

246
00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.583
Right down here,
I want Fackler and Martin.

247
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.342
I've known him since childhood--

248
00:21:02.511 --> 00:21:07.302
- Right here, Mahoney and Tackleberry.
- Yes, sir! Thank you, sir!

249
00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:11.434
Thank you.
I've always wanted to live with a nut.

250
00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:13.846
My pleasure.

251
00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:16.853
- Mahoney, is it?
- Yes, sir. I'd like to say one more--

252
00:21:17.026 --> 00:21:21.020
The rest of you wimps come with me.
Move it, move it, move it.

253
00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:22.483
Wimps?

254
00:21:27.077 --> 00:21:29.410
- You're married, huh?
- Yeah.

255
00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:31.863
That's beautiful, man.

256
00:21:32.041 --> 00:21:34.203
To me, marriage is a sacred institution.

257
00:21:35.252 --> 00:21:36.709
So tell me.

258
00:21:36.879 --> 00:21:39.587
You and the wife do it doggie-style
or what?

259
00:21:56.482 --> 00:21:58.769
Room ready for inspection, sir.

260
00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:01.977
Good haircuts, men.

261
00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:04.020
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

262
00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.402
Damn good haircuts.

263
00:22:06.575 --> 00:22:08.316
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

264
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.241
Men...

265
00:22:16.418 --> 00:22:18.626
...I've got a little problem.

266
00:22:19.129 --> 00:22:22.713
It seems I've got a squad
full of scumbuckets.

267
00:22:22.883 --> 00:22:25.045
A whole big bunch of losers.

268
00:22:25.719 --> 00:22:29.133
And I was kind of hoping
that you two fine, young cadets...

269
00:22:29.974 --> 00:22:32.933
...might help me to just get rid of
a few of them.

270
00:22:33.477 --> 00:22:37.391
What do you say?
Will you help me out?

271
00:22:38.691 --> 00:22:41.434
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

272
00:22:43.571 --> 00:22:47.656
- Good.
- I'm Copeland, sir. Chad Copeland.

273
00:22:48.534 --> 00:22:50.150
Good for you.

274
00:22:53.247 --> 00:22:56.331
Hi, I'm Douglas Fackler.
I always wanted to be a cop.

275
00:23:12.725 --> 00:23:15.012
<i>Lieutenant Hoffman, Lieutenant Hoffman...</i>

276
00:23:15.185 --> 00:23:17.268
<i>...report immediately to the infirmary.</i>

277
00:23:17.813 --> 00:23:19.805
Hey, Thompson. Well?

278
00:23:19.982 --> 00:23:22.645
- How do I look?
- That wasn't very funny this morning.

279
00:23:22.818 --> 00:23:25.310
Wasn't funny.
I'd give anything to see your thighs.

280
00:23:25.487 --> 00:23:27.570
Don't suppose you'd describe them for me.

281
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:32.280
Well, they're tan, of course.
Very supple, well-rounded...

282
00:23:32.453 --> 00:23:35.321
...and luxuriant to the touch.

283
00:23:35.497 --> 00:23:36.578
Mm.

284
00:23:36.749 --> 00:23:39.583
Absolute silence!

285
00:23:44.798 --> 00:23:49.168
My name is Lt. Harris...

286
00:23:49.345 --> 00:23:51.712
...in case you missed it.

287
00:23:55.643 --> 00:23:59.057
This is Sgt. Callahan...

288
00:23:59.229 --> 00:24:01.391
...in case you missed it.

289
00:24:01.565 --> 00:24:05.684
We are the meanest instructors here.

290
00:24:05.861 --> 00:24:11.778
We've got you because
you are the worst people here.

291
00:24:13.786 --> 00:24:16.574
You people are D-Squad.

292
00:24:16.747 --> 00:24:19.285
D for dirtbags.

293
00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:24.374
When I say, "Hey, dirtbags,"
that means you.

294
00:24:24.546 --> 00:24:29.041
You people are going to hate my guts
for the rest of your lives.

295
00:24:29.218 --> 00:24:34.304
I am going to make you sorry
that you ever came here.

296
00:24:34.682 --> 00:24:38.471
Now, it is traditional here at the Academy
for each squad...

297
00:24:38.644 --> 00:24:41.011
...to have two student squad-leaders.

298
00:24:41.188 --> 00:24:46.024
I have chosen Cadets Blankes
and Dopeland. Step out, men.

299
00:24:46.735 --> 00:24:50.228
If these two cadets give you an order...

300
00:24:50.823 --> 00:24:54.066
...obey it.

301
00:24:55.786 --> 00:24:59.245
Now, I thought it would be nice...

302
00:24:59.415 --> 00:25:03.284
...if we were to close out
our first afternoon together...

303
00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:07.670
...with a nice little stroll
around the campus.

304
00:25:12.845 --> 00:25:16.338
Move out, maggots!

305
00:25:22.855 --> 00:25:26.940
- Holy, shit.
- This is definitely not Ecuador.

306
00:25:30.821 --> 00:25:32.938
Get up, Barbara. Get up. Get up.

307
00:25:33.115 --> 00:25:34.606
Move it, move it, move it.

308
00:25:34.783 --> 00:25:38.242
I could show a movie on your butt, fatso.

309
00:25:38.412 --> 00:25:40.904
Nineteen. Twenty!

310
00:25:42.875 --> 00:25:46.915
More! I want more!

311
00:25:47.087 --> 00:25:49.545
Fifteen.

312
00:25:49.715 --> 00:25:51.752
Sixteen.

313
00:25:51.925 --> 00:25:54.133
Seventeen.

314
00:25:54.303 --> 00:25:59.094
Eighteen. Let's go. Let's go.

315
00:25:59.266 --> 00:26:03.476
Nine. Ten.

316
00:26:06.356 --> 00:26:09.520
<i>Attention. Lights out in 10 minutes.</i>

317
00:26:09.693 --> 00:26:12.652
<i>Lights out in 10 minutes.</i>

318
00:26:46.605 --> 00:26:49.063
Game over.

319
00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.657
Asshole.

320
00:27:00.911 --> 00:27:04.655
Police work...

321
00:27:04.832 --> 00:27:07.870
...is what...

322
00:27:08.043 --> 00:27:10.205
...you are...

323
00:27:10.379 --> 00:27:14.373
...here for.

324
00:27:15.175 --> 00:27:18.168
Arrest...

325
00:27:18.345 --> 00:27:22.840
...procedures...

326
00:27:23.016 --> 00:27:27.556
...traffic violations...

327
00:27:27.729 --> 00:27:30.016
...high-speed...

328
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:32.352
...driving...

329
00:27:32.526 --> 00:27:34.609
...self-defense.

330
00:27:34.778 --> 00:27:40.524
And you will have many examinations...

331
00:27:40.701 --> 00:27:44.240
...which you must pass.

332
00:27:44.913 --> 00:27:46.495
Plus...

333
00:27:46.999 --> 00:27:51.369
...you will endure an extremely rigorous
physical training program.

334
00:27:51.545 --> 00:27:54.583
Do you know what that means, Hooks?

335
00:27:55.883 --> 00:27:58.216
I'm not sure, sir.

336
00:27:58.385 --> 00:28:00.001
What?

337
00:28:02.514 --> 00:28:04.801
Voice commands.

338
00:28:04.975 --> 00:28:08.935
We will learn to use our voices
with authority.

339
00:28:09.104 --> 00:28:11.096
Won't we, Hooks?

340
00:28:14.443 --> 00:28:19.780
Now, have any of you
had any military training?

341
00:28:22.784 --> 00:28:23.774
Mm-hm?

342
00:28:23.952 --> 00:28:28.287
I served with the U.S. Army
Airborne 209th Special Forces Unit.

343
00:28:28.665 --> 00:28:30.076
Anybody else?

344
00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:31.536
<i>What?</i>

345
00:28:32.252 --> 00:28:35.836
You have had prior
military training, Mahoney?

346
00:28:36.006 --> 00:28:39.170
- Well, yes, but not in this life, sir.
- What?

347
00:28:39.343 --> 00:28:42.381
In a previous life, I served
with Her Majesty's Forces in India.

348
00:28:42.554 --> 00:28:46.218
- Interesting sideline--
- If you're trying to get thrown out...

349
00:28:46.391 --> 00:28:48.553
...I'm afraid that's quite impossible.

350
00:28:48.727 --> 00:28:51.094
Impossible?
What the hell's going on here?

351
00:28:51.271 --> 00:28:53.263
I'll have to see the commandant about this.

352
00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:59.607
You will also learn the Municipal Code.
And you will learn them by heart.

353
00:29:00.197 --> 00:29:01.608
<i>Cadet Mahoney. Cadet Mahoney.</i>

354
00:29:01.782 --> 00:29:05.526
<i>Report immediately to the commandant's
office. Cadet Mahoney.</i>

355
00:29:05.702 --> 00:29:11.664
Okay, Mahoney, get going. On the double.
Move it. Move it. Move it.

356
00:29:13.961 --> 00:29:14.997
Now--

357
00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:16.957
<i>Lieutenant Harris, Lieutenant Harris...</i>

358
00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:20.043
<i>...report immediately to the firing range.
Lieutenant Harris.</i>

359
00:29:21.969 --> 00:29:23.676
Excuse me.

360
00:29:24.137 --> 00:29:25.469
Callahan, take over.

361
00:29:28.809 --> 00:29:30.300
Howdy.

362
00:29:30.644 --> 00:29:32.977
- No one's allowed in here.
- Listen.

363
00:29:33.146 --> 00:29:35.513
- I got a problem, chief.
- It's commandant.

364
00:29:35.691 --> 00:29:38.525
Commandant, I'm sorry.
Is that your fish?

365
00:29:38.694 --> 00:29:40.811
- No, it belongs to a friend.
- Very pretty.

366
00:29:40.988 --> 00:29:43.605
- What do you want?
- I want out of here. Right now.

367
00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:46.900
- Out of this office?
- No, out of the Academy.

368
00:29:47.077 --> 00:29:49.990
- That's no problem. You can just quit.
- I can't quit.

369
00:29:50.163 --> 00:29:52.871
Of course you can.
Many, many wonderful people...

370
00:29:53.041 --> 00:29:55.078
- ...have quit many, many--
- Commandant?

371
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:57.160
Do you know Capt. Reed?

372
00:29:57.337 --> 00:30:01.923
Oh, yes. Capt. Reed. You're Mahoney.

373
00:30:03.719 --> 00:30:07.258
Mahoney. Mahoney. Mahoney.

374
00:30:08.473 --> 00:30:11.261
- You're a special case. You can't quit.
- I know that.

375
00:30:11.435 --> 00:30:14.553
- On the other hand, I can't throw you out.
- Why not?

376
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:18.724
I promised Capt. Reed. I promised
I'd keep you here the full 24 weeks.

377
00:30:19.526 --> 00:30:23.019
You what? You what? You told--?

378
00:30:23.196 --> 00:30:25.779
He told me that I could...

379
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:31.573
- I'm trapped here?
- Well, yes. We all are.

380
00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:36.203
Pick it up, pick it up.
Keep moving up that hill.

381
00:30:38.503 --> 00:30:39.914
Put some muscle in it.

382
00:30:40.088 --> 00:30:42.922
Get those knees up.
Get those knees up, come on!

383
00:30:54.603 --> 00:30:55.969
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

384
00:30:56.146 --> 00:30:57.978
This is definitely not for me.

385
00:31:03.779 --> 00:31:04.860
Keep going!

386
00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:22.795
Come on, Hooks, get over the wall.
Move it, move it, move it.

387
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:26.674
Come on, Hooks, get up.

388
00:31:26.843 --> 00:31:30.837
Skip it. Go around. You'll never make it.
Why don't you quit now?

389
00:31:31.014 --> 00:31:33.927
Quit, quit, quit. You'll never make it.

390
00:31:34.101 --> 00:31:39.142
Sir, I'm terribly sorry,
but I seem to have ripped my pants.

391
00:31:44.319 --> 00:31:46.356
Don't try me, punk.

392
00:31:47.614 --> 00:31:49.776
Now, wise guy...

393
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:52.033
...you run, don't trot...

394
00:31:52.202 --> 00:31:56.537
...to the supply room,
and you get a new pair.

395
00:31:57.207 --> 00:31:59.620
Yes, sir. I'll be back later in the day.

396
00:31:59.793 --> 00:32:03.161
Be back in five minutes!

397
00:32:03.338 --> 00:32:06.172
Yes, sir. Shit, I'm deaf.

398
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:19.347
Hey, you got any brown shoe-polish?

399
00:32:19.521 --> 00:32:21.103
I've got cordovan. Who's it for?

400
00:32:21.273 --> 00:32:23.185
Lieutenant Harris.

401
00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:43.539
Sir! Look, sir, new pants.

402
00:32:43.712 --> 00:32:45.669
What are you doing--? Give me that.

403
00:32:45.839 --> 00:32:49.924
All right, you scumbags, you have
30 minutes to shower and get to class.

404
00:32:50.093 --> 00:32:52.676
Let's go. Move it. Move it. Move it.

405
00:32:52.846 --> 00:32:55.008
Pick it up. Pick it up.

406
00:32:55.182 --> 00:32:58.050
Pick it up, assholes.

407
00:33:05.859 --> 00:33:08.602
So far, nobody's quit.

408
00:33:08.778 --> 00:33:09.859
But they will.

409
00:33:33.762 --> 00:33:36.129
Well, well, well.

410
00:33:37.015 --> 00:33:40.099
I told you not to try me, boy.

411
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:42.760
Stand up.

412
00:33:44.856 --> 00:33:47.644
Now, I want you two squad leaders...

413
00:33:47.817 --> 00:33:50.935
...to take Mr. Mahoney here
and run him until he throws up.

414
00:33:51.112 --> 00:33:52.148
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

415
00:33:52.322 --> 00:33:55.531
And then, just after he throws up...

416
00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.032
...run him some more.

417
00:33:57.202 --> 00:33:58.909
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

418
00:34:01.498 --> 00:34:04.366
You are going to learn, Mahoney...

419
00:34:04.793 --> 00:34:06.785
...that nobody...

420
00:34:07.921 --> 00:34:10.129
...nobody...

421
00:34:10.298 --> 00:34:12.460
...screws...

422
00:34:13.051 --> 00:34:14.792
...with me.

423
00:34:15.512 --> 00:34:18.004
- Pick it up, pick it up! Come on!
- Hey, this is great.

424
00:34:18.181 --> 00:34:19.968
- Two assholes, no waiting.
- Move it!

425
00:34:20.141 --> 00:34:23.555
Chad, would you please just let me
yell at him without interrupting?

426
00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:27.096
- Sure.
- Come on, Mahoney! Move it, move it!

427
00:35:16.823 --> 00:35:18.359
Bang!

428
00:35:28.501 --> 00:35:31.869
Son, where did you get this gun?

429
00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:34.998
- My mom gave it to me.
- Ah.

430
00:35:35.175 --> 00:35:37.963
Can I borrow it for a little while?

431
00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:40.002
Sure.

432
00:35:41.556 --> 00:35:47.052
Left, left right left.
Left, left, left right left.

433
00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:53.900
You will learn to defend yourselves
without stick or firearm.

434
00:35:55.028 --> 00:35:56.564
I need a volunteer.

435
00:35:56.738 --> 00:35:59.822
- Barbara, get out here.
- I just ate.

436
00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:04.110
Right where I'm standing.
Right here. Right now.

437
00:36:06.706 --> 00:36:09.540
All right, come at me
with an imaginary knife.

438
00:36:09.709 --> 00:36:10.916
Do I have to?

439
00:36:11.086 --> 00:36:14.579
Yes, you do. I'm not joking.

440
00:36:14.756 --> 00:36:17.499
Come on. Come on.

441
00:36:17.676 --> 00:36:20.464
- Now!
- Aah!

442
00:36:20.637 --> 00:36:22.879
Ouch! Ouch!

443
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:30.474
Okay. That's how it's done. Who's next?

444
00:36:30.647 --> 00:36:32.764
- Pick me!
- I'd love it. I'd love to go.

445
00:36:32.941 --> 00:36:35.183
I'd love to go. We'll both go.

446
00:36:35.443 --> 00:36:37.605
You have 20 minutes to complete the test.

447
00:36:37.779 --> 00:36:40.988
Try to answer as many questions
as possible.

448
00:36:41.157 --> 00:36:43.524
All right, start.

449
00:36:54.462 --> 00:36:58.502
<i>All right, here we go.
The count's at two. Here's the pitch.</i>

450
00:36:58.967 --> 00:37:00.378
<i>Swung on and missed!</i>

451
00:37:02.137 --> 00:37:03.844
<i>Struck out.</i>

452
00:37:17.819 --> 00:37:21.813
<i>Well, it was Saturday night
And I was feeling all right</i>

453
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:23.822
<i>Looking for my buttercup</i>

454
00:37:24.951 --> 00:37:28.740
<i>They were dancing next door
On the thirteenth floor</i>

455
00:38:06.326 --> 00:38:07.737
You know, Mahoney...

456
00:38:07.911 --> 00:38:12.372
...I'd like to spend the next month
breaking you into little pieces.

457
00:38:13.333 --> 00:38:14.949
But I won't...

458
00:38:15.168 --> 00:38:17.205
...because you're bad.

459
00:38:17.378 --> 00:38:19.870
You're bad for morale, Mahoney.

460
00:38:20.632 --> 00:38:23.625
You look like the sweet little boy
from next door.

461
00:38:23.802 --> 00:38:26.010
Ha. But you don't fool me. Oh, no.

462
00:38:26.179 --> 00:38:29.547
No, you're the devil,
and you're rotten to the core.

463
00:38:29.724 --> 00:38:31.386
And you're ruining my chances...

464
00:38:31.559 --> 00:38:34.472
...of training some men
who might make pretty good cops.

465
00:38:34.646 --> 00:38:36.228
I agree. I've been saying that.

466
00:38:36.397 --> 00:38:39.481
- You make me sick.
- Thank you, sir. I make everybody sick.

467
00:38:39.651 --> 00:38:43.395
We're going to pick up this telephone
and call your buddy Capt. Reed.

468
00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:48.066
And you. You are going to help me
talk him out of this terrible mistake.

469
00:38:48.743 --> 00:38:50.075
Terrific. I'll do my part.

470
00:38:50.245 --> 00:38:52.362
You're damn right you will.

471
00:38:54.874 --> 00:38:56.240
Ha.

472
00:38:59.754 --> 00:39:03.873
This is the Academy.
I'd like to speak to a Capt. Reed.

473
00:39:04.801 --> 00:39:06.918
Reed!

474
00:39:10.557 --> 00:39:13.891
Captain Reed? Uh, yes, sir.
How are you, sir?

475
00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:17.929
This is Lt. Harris, Lt. Thaddeus Harris
out at the Police Academy.

476
00:39:18.106 --> 00:39:20.974
I'm so sorry to disturb you, sir...

477
00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:25.110
...but your friend Cadet Mahoney
would like to speak with you.

478
00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:28.193
Just one moment, please. Mahoney.

479
00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:31.234
- Mahoney!
- Oh, yeah.

480
00:39:31.953 --> 00:39:34.445
Hi, Captain Reed? Can I get out of here?

481
00:39:34.622 --> 00:39:36.329
No? Okay.

482
00:39:36.499 --> 00:39:38.286
I tried.

483
00:39:40.044 --> 00:39:43.458
Captain Reed, um, thank you so much.

484
00:39:43.631 --> 00:39:45.372
Yes. Goodbye. Yes.

485
00:39:47.969 --> 00:39:50.086
I don't know what you're trying to do.

486
00:39:50.263 --> 00:39:52.255
I don't know why you're here.

487
00:39:52.432 --> 00:39:55.220
But you'll never be a cop
as long as I live.

488
00:39:55.393 --> 00:39:57.180
- Don't want to be.
- Get your butt off my desk.

489
00:39:57.353 --> 00:39:59.265
And get out of here!

490
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:02.806
Mahoney!

491
00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:05.692
I've already told you once.

492
00:40:05.862 --> 00:40:08.696
Nobody screws with me.

493
00:40:09.324 --> 00:40:12.158
Well, maybe you'll meet the right girl
and all that'll change.

494
00:40:12.327 --> 00:40:14.785
Get out of here now!

495
00:40:18.458 --> 00:40:21.201
Come on, Mahoney.
Harris said you had to do a hundred.

496
00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:26.626
Hey, Mahoney.

497
00:40:26.799 --> 00:40:29.837
Here's a pair of my old sweat socks.
I wore them all day.

498
00:40:30.011 --> 00:40:32.173
That should help you to get up.

499
00:40:41.189 --> 00:40:42.851
You did it.

500
00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.108
You son of a bitch.

501
00:41:07.131 --> 00:41:09.965
This is a hell of a way
to spend my evenings.

502
00:41:12.762 --> 00:41:14.674
I can't feel my arms anymore.

503
00:41:19.102 --> 00:41:21.094
Hey, Barbara, come here.

504
00:41:21.521 --> 00:41:22.762
- Me?
- Yeah, come here.

505
00:41:22.939 --> 00:41:25.306
- What?
- Come on, right here.

506
00:41:27.402 --> 00:41:29.485
- I want you to give me your best shot.
- What?

507
00:41:29.654 --> 00:41:31.111
I want you to hit me. Best shot.

508
00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.612
- Hit you?
- Yeah, come on.

509
00:41:32.782 --> 00:41:35.274
- Ha, ha. No, really, I--
- Hit me.

510
00:41:35.451 --> 00:41:37.568
- Really, when I--
- Do it now. Come on.

511
00:41:37.745 --> 00:41:40.658
- I can't. Because when I--
- Do it. Give me your--

512
00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:43.532
How was that? Was that okay?

513
00:41:44.419 --> 00:41:45.910
Yeah.

514
00:41:46.087 --> 00:41:48.170
Yeah, that's good.

515
00:41:53.803 --> 00:41:58.138
This weekend is your first leave
from the Academy.

516
00:41:58.307 --> 00:42:03.348
When you go, wherever it is
you filthbags go...

517
00:42:03.521 --> 00:42:07.606
...do take note of how nice things are
on the outside.

518
00:42:07.775 --> 00:42:12.145
Do give serious consideration
to not coming back.

519
00:42:12.321 --> 00:42:14.438
Four of you have already quit.

520
00:42:14.615 --> 00:42:17.574
And that's just the beginning.

521
00:42:18.286 --> 00:42:20.573
Ten-hut!

522
00:42:21.122 --> 00:42:22.158
Dismissed.

523
00:42:22.331 --> 00:42:25.620
Heard him, dismissed! Let's go.

524
00:42:25.793 --> 00:42:29.582
They'll get together for a party.
They always do.

525
00:42:29.756 --> 00:42:31.622
You go with them.

526
00:42:32.133 --> 00:42:36.047
Whenever they get out of line,
give me a ring.

527
00:42:42.018 --> 00:42:44.226
Hi, Leslie.

528
00:42:46.105 --> 00:42:47.641
Studying hard?

529
00:42:48.149 --> 00:42:49.185
Yup.

530
00:42:49.484 --> 00:42:51.897
Where's the party going to be this weekend?

531
00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:53.481
Party?

532
00:42:53.654 --> 00:42:55.771
Party? I don't know anything
about a party.

533
00:42:55.948 --> 00:42:58.486
I'm going home for the weekend
and visit my mom and dad.

534
00:42:58.659 --> 00:43:01.948
Now, if you don't mind,
I do have to study.

535
00:43:02.121 --> 00:43:05.865
You know, Chad?
I don't think we've got his full attention.

536
00:43:06.042 --> 00:43:09.535
So why don't you take his books
and throw them out the window?

537
00:43:09.712 --> 00:43:12.500
My pleasure, Kyle.

538
00:43:22.683 --> 00:43:25.050
Find out where the party is.

539
00:43:25.228 --> 00:43:28.062
- How?
- Ask Mahoney.

540
00:43:28.231 --> 00:43:30.439
- Mahoney.
- Mahoney.

541
00:43:30.608 --> 00:43:34.147
Thousand eleven, 1012, 1013...

542
00:43:35.738 --> 00:43:38.025
Mahoney.

543
00:43:38.199 --> 00:43:40.532
Could I speak to you outside
for just a second?

544
00:43:40.701 --> 00:43:42.192
Yeah.

545
00:43:45.164 --> 00:43:47.076
- What's up?
- Um...

546
00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:49.207
Uh, Mahoney. Uh...

547
00:43:50.795 --> 00:43:52.286
Is there a party this weekend?

548
00:43:52.672 --> 00:43:54.914
Yeah, of course there is.
Do you want to come?

549
00:43:55.091 --> 00:43:57.083
No. No, I can't. Uh...

550
00:43:58.052 --> 00:44:00.760
I just need to know where it is.
Sorry to be asking.

551
00:44:01.556 --> 00:44:02.842
Then why are you asking?

552
00:44:03.558 --> 00:44:06.050
Some people want to know.

553
00:44:06.227 --> 00:44:09.720
Okay, yeah. It's no big secret.
It's at the, uh, Blue Oyster bar.

554
00:44:09.897 --> 00:44:12.264
<i>It's on Howell.</i>

555
00:44:32.336 --> 00:44:34.373
<i>Hey, big boy
Why don't you come up</i>

556
00:44:34.547 --> 00:44:36.038
<i>And see me sometime?</i>

557
00:44:39.552 --> 00:44:41.509
<i>Hey, big boy</i>

558
00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:02.739
So, what about you, Hightower?
What are you doing at the Academy?

559
00:45:02.909 --> 00:45:05.071
I got bored with my chosen profession.

560
00:45:05.244 --> 00:45:07.861
- What was that?
- I was a florist.

561
00:45:08.039 --> 00:45:09.075
A florist?

562
00:45:09.248 --> 00:45:11.956
You know, flowers and shit.

563
00:45:12.793 --> 00:45:14.625
Oh, yeah.

564
00:46:06.931 --> 00:46:09.514
- Hi.
- Hi.

565
00:46:11.811 --> 00:46:15.600
- I didn't think you'd show up.
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.

566
00:46:27.368 --> 00:46:30.281
- Do you want to go for a walk?
- Hmm?

567
00:46:30.454 --> 00:46:31.865
- Walk.
- Oh, yeah.

568
00:46:32.039 --> 00:46:34.031
Are you kidding? Of course.

569
00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:56.182
- Can you tell me something?
- Yeah?

570
00:46:56.397 --> 00:46:58.639
Why do you want to be a cop?

571
00:47:02.945 --> 00:47:05.733
I like to dress like a man.

572
00:47:07.366 --> 00:47:08.982
Me too.

573
00:47:12.705 --> 00:47:17.825
<i>Tonight you're mine completely</i>

574
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:25.416
<i>You give your love so sweetly</i>

575
00:47:25.843 --> 00:47:32.807
<i>Tonight the light of love is in your eyes</i>

576
00:47:33.768 --> 00:47:39.605
<i>But will you love me tomorrow?</i>

577
00:47:40.858 --> 00:47:46.399
<i>Is this a lasting treasure</i>

578
00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:53.827
<i>Or just a moment's pleasure?</i>

579
00:48:04.757 --> 00:48:09.548
Okay, let's go. Move it. Move it. Let's go.

580
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:16.595
Two lines, right here.

581
00:48:16.769 --> 00:48:19.512
The first one on the step,
the second one off.

582
00:48:22.358 --> 00:48:25.817
I said two lines, dummy!
Now step it up, step it up, let's go.

583
00:48:25.986 --> 00:48:27.227
Hey.

584
00:48:28.322 --> 00:48:30.655
Why didn't you call me this weekend?

585
00:48:33.327 --> 00:48:36.365
Well, uh, nothing really happened, sir.

586
00:48:36.539 --> 00:48:39.202
There was a party, wasn't there?

587
00:48:40.251 --> 00:48:41.742
Yes, sir.

588
00:48:42.336 --> 00:48:43.872
Well, what went on?

589
00:48:46.173 --> 00:48:48.005
Dancing, sir.

590
00:48:48.467 --> 00:48:49.628
Mostly dancing.

591
00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:57.091
Dancing?

592
00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:04.685
Hightower, you're first. Let's go.

593
00:49:14.994 --> 00:49:16.656
Come with me.

594
00:49:40.394 --> 00:49:41.885
Uh...

595
00:49:43.397 --> 00:49:45.229
Ready now, sir.

596
00:49:49.236 --> 00:49:51.694
Uh, thank you.

597
00:49:52.698 --> 00:49:54.234
I got him.

598
00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:03.407
Tackleberry. You're next.

599
00:50:18.432 --> 00:50:19.923
Come with me.

600
00:50:26.649 --> 00:50:29.687
- Hey!
- Tackleberry!

601
00:51:01.767 --> 00:51:03.429
Holy shit.

602
00:51:06.188 --> 00:51:08.305
Get back here.

603
00:51:15.322 --> 00:51:17.530
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, ma'am.

604
00:51:20.327 --> 00:51:23.320
- Don't worry, I can explain everything.
- Shut up.

605
00:51:23.497 --> 00:51:26.990
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, ma'am.

606
00:51:27.167 --> 00:51:28.658
Yes, ma'am.

607
00:51:29.211 --> 00:51:32.921
You've been sneaking in here
every night for weeks.

608
00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:34.956
What? No.

609
00:51:35.134 --> 00:51:39.048
What do you think I ought to do about this?

610
00:51:39.221 --> 00:51:41.884
Well, let's see. Uh...

611
00:51:47.354 --> 00:51:48.970
My God.

612
00:51:52.067 --> 00:51:53.854
Sir.

613
00:51:55.112 --> 00:51:56.694
Ma'am.

614
00:52:07.458 --> 00:52:11.702
A police officer must generate
respect and confidence.

615
00:52:11.879 --> 00:52:14.713
His or her voice, Hooks...

616
00:52:14.882 --> 00:52:18.592
...has a great deal to do with that.
Hooks, get up. Stand right over here.

617
00:52:18.761 --> 00:52:20.844
Today, Hooks.

618
00:52:22.014 --> 00:52:26.008
Now, here is the house.

619
00:52:26.185 --> 00:52:28.302
Here is the window.

620
00:52:28.479 --> 00:52:31.392
And I am a burglar.

621
00:52:32.024 --> 00:52:34.892
I am coming out of the window...

622
00:52:35.069 --> 00:52:38.403
...with a stolen stereo in my hand.

623
00:52:38.572 --> 00:52:41.906
I'm coming out of the window,
over the hedge...

624
00:52:42.076 --> 00:52:44.318
...and you are the arresting officer.

625
00:52:44.495 --> 00:52:46.157
What do you say, Hooks?

626
00:52:46.747 --> 00:52:49.956
Don't move! This is a stickup.

627
00:52:51.752 --> 00:52:53.084
Stickup?

628
00:52:53.253 --> 00:52:56.712
I mean, police-- Police officer. Stop.

629
00:52:57.508 --> 00:53:00.125
Sit down, Hooks.

630
00:53:00.594 --> 00:53:01.801
Sit, sit, sit.

631
00:53:04.306 --> 00:53:07.470
Tackleberry, you try it. Same situation.

632
00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:11.140
All right. Here is the house.
Here is the window.

633
00:53:11.313 --> 00:53:15.432
I'm the burglar. I'm coming out
of the house, over the hedge...

634
00:53:15.609 --> 00:53:17.817
...I've got the stolen stereo in my hands.

635
00:53:17.986 --> 00:53:22.151
Drop that stereo before I blow
your goddamn nuts off, asshole!

636
00:53:26.286 --> 00:53:30.200
Tackleberry, we really need to talk.

637
00:53:31.125 --> 00:53:33.663
Mahoney, let me ask you a question.

638
00:53:33.836 --> 00:53:35.043
Hmm?

639
00:53:35.212 --> 00:53:37.829
Have you ever had a woman just...

640
00:53:38.006 --> 00:53:41.545
...throw you down
and screw your goddamn brains out?

641
00:53:41.719 --> 00:53:43.051
Uh, no.

642
00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:45.633
It happened to me last night.

643
00:53:45.806 --> 00:53:48.924
Really? How was it?

644
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:51.767
I think, uh...

645
00:53:53.355 --> 00:53:55.312
...I'm in love.

646
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:57.186
Wow.

647
00:53:58.569 --> 00:54:00.481
- How many girls were there?
- Just one.

648
00:54:00.654 --> 00:54:02.190
Just one?

649
00:54:03.323 --> 00:54:06.031
You made love to just one girl?

650
00:54:06.201 --> 00:54:07.692
That's disgusting.

651
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:09.577
Yeah, I know.

652
00:54:10.998 --> 00:54:14.787
- Hey, George, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

653
00:54:16.295 --> 00:54:18.787
Every now and then, uh...

654
00:54:18.964 --> 00:54:21.502
...you seem to lose your Spanish accent.

655
00:54:21.675 --> 00:54:23.587
What's up?

656
00:54:23.761 --> 00:54:26.674
Yeah. Every now and then.

657
00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:30.302
Can you keep a secret?

658
00:54:30.476 --> 00:54:31.842
Oh, yeah.

659
00:54:32.019 --> 00:54:34.727
I'm not really George Martin.

660
00:54:34.897 --> 00:54:39.688
I'm just plain old George Martin,
fourth-generation American. Ha, ha.

661
00:54:40.068 --> 00:54:42.606
- Really?
- I just use the accent to get the girls.

662
00:54:44.531 --> 00:54:47.114
- Does it work?
- Eh.

663
00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:54.698
- Barbara!
- Uh, he's in the gym.

664
00:54:54.875 --> 00:54:57.242
You're gonna pay for sending us
to the wrong party.

665
00:54:57.419 --> 00:55:00.207
- I'll tell him.
- Not just pushups, either, Leslie.

666
00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:04.044
We're gonna get your fat ass
thrown out of here. That's a promise!

667
00:55:04.218 --> 00:55:05.754
- How?
- How?

668
00:55:05.928 --> 00:55:07.044
You'll find out.

669
00:55:07.221 --> 00:55:09.804
Mahoney isn't the only one here
who can play tricks.

670
00:55:09.973 --> 00:55:12.181
Hey, hey. Take it easy.
These ain't track shoes.

671
00:55:12.351 --> 00:55:13.637
Yeah, I know. Just hurry up.

672
00:55:13.811 --> 00:55:17.475
I'm as anxious as you.
I'm not comfortable in these surroundings.

673
00:55:17.648 --> 00:55:19.605
- Yeah, well, come on up.
- Up here?

674
00:55:19.775 --> 00:55:22.438
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hey, listen, when do I get my money?

675
00:55:22.611 --> 00:55:24.568
When the job's over,
for crying out loud.

676
00:55:33.956 --> 00:55:37.950
That's good, Hightower.
Why don't you just sit down over there?

677
00:55:41.463 --> 00:55:44.922
All right, you scumballs,
30 minutes to room inspection.

678
00:55:45.092 --> 00:55:47.926
Move it. Move it. Move it.

679
00:55:49.096 --> 00:55:53.056
- Hi, honey.
- Hi. Uh...

680
00:55:57.229 --> 00:56:00.438
- Got a light?
- Uh...

681
00:56:00.607 --> 00:56:05.272
I don't smoke. Ha, ha.
I have a friend who smokes. I'll go get him.

682
00:56:08.282 --> 00:56:10.399
Mahoney, major problem.

683
00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:18.619
Well, my goodness.

684
00:56:23.881 --> 00:56:28.216
Would you please just calm down
and take it easy?

685
00:56:30.345 --> 00:56:34.259
I just like to do it in strange places,
that's all. Okay?

686
00:56:34.433 --> 00:56:35.890
Why the hell didn't you say so?

687
00:56:37.144 --> 00:56:40.933
You'll find this academy one of the most
comprehensive in the country.

688
00:56:41.106 --> 00:56:45.646
I could point out many,
many, many features to you. Um...

689
00:56:47.154 --> 00:56:49.271
- Squeeze in here. Yeah.
- In here?

690
00:56:49.448 --> 00:56:51.485
- You want to do it in a podium?
- All my life.

691
00:56:51.658 --> 00:56:53.524
- Right. Where you going?
- I'll be back.

692
00:56:53.702 --> 00:56:57.616
I'm not the customer. The real customer
will be here any second now, okay?

693
00:56:57.789 --> 00:56:59.621
Oh, okay.

694
00:56:59.791 --> 00:57:01.953
Gentlemen, please follow me.

695
00:57:02.127 --> 00:57:04.665
We have a very, very fine...

696
00:57:04.838 --> 00:57:07.171
...slide presentation for you.

697
00:57:08.342 --> 00:57:10.334
Please take your seats.

698
00:57:10.677 --> 00:57:13.761
I think you'll find
there's plenty of room for everybody.

699
00:57:14.765 --> 00:57:16.176
Thank you.

700
00:57:20.854 --> 00:57:23.471
First of all, I'd like to say
how sorry I am...

701
00:57:23.649 --> 00:57:25.891
...that everybody could not make it today.

702
00:57:26.068 --> 00:57:30.529
For those here, I think you'll find
the presentation interesting...

703
00:57:30.697 --> 00:57:33.360
...as well as very, very stimulating.

704
00:57:42.542 --> 00:57:45.205
Could we have the lights turned down?

705
00:57:46.505 --> 00:57:49.213
Now, this first slide...

706
00:57:49.841 --> 00:57:51.958
...shows a very...

707
00:57:52.594 --> 00:57:54.301
...very interesting thing:

708
00:57:55.222 --> 00:57:57.179
Our main building.

709
00:57:58.725 --> 00:58:01.889
In slide two...

710
00:58:04.398 --> 00:58:06.185
...we see...

711
00:58:07.234 --> 00:58:08.896
...another view...

712
00:58:09.069 --> 00:58:11.436
...of it.

713
00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:15.398
Oh, my God. You wouldn't believe it.

714
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:27.790
Let us look at this slide for a moment,
without comment.

715
00:58:27.963 --> 00:58:30.205
I think it speaks for itself.

716
00:58:45.355 --> 00:58:47.017
Could we have the lights, please?

717
00:58:51.278 --> 00:58:52.689
Well.

718
00:58:53.238 --> 00:58:57.608
I hope this was as much fun for you
as it was for me.

719
00:58:59.786 --> 00:59:02.119
Let's have lunch, shall we?

720
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:06.703
And maybe, smoke a cigarette.

721
00:59:29.316 --> 00:59:31.057
Good speech.

722
01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:03.598
What do you intend to do about Mahoney?

723
01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.679
- What's he done?
- What's he done?

724
01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:09.971
I'll tell you what he's done. He...

725
01:00:13.652 --> 01:00:14.984
Yes, sir?

726
01:00:15.153 --> 01:00:17.361
He did a very, very bad thing.

727
01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:20.152
To whom, sir?

728
01:00:20.325 --> 01:00:22.237
To whom?

729
01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:27.697
Yes, sir.

730
01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:31.500
Well, I don't know.

731
01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:34.245
Are you all right, sir?

732
01:00:34.422 --> 01:00:37.460
No, not really. May I go?

733
01:00:38.426 --> 01:00:40.918
- Of course, sir.
- Thank you.

734
01:00:41.096 --> 01:00:42.837
You're welcome.

735
01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:50.224
Left, right, left. Left. Left.

736
01:00:59.531 --> 01:01:01.944
Left, right, left. Left.

737
01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:21.293
Left, right, left.
Left. Left. Left, right, left.

738
01:01:21.469 --> 01:01:26.055
From now on, part of your training
will be to ride, from time to time...

739
01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:29.638
...in actual squad cars
with actual police officers...

740
01:01:29.811 --> 01:01:31.598
...in actual situations.

741
01:01:31.771 --> 01:01:34.639
And you'd better actually
keep your mouths shut.

742
01:01:34.816 --> 01:01:37.274
And your eyes and your ears open.

743
01:01:37.444 --> 01:01:41.108
Say, Mahoney,
why don't you ride with me?

744
01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:48.198
Well, move it, cretins!
Move it, move it, move it!

745
01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:52.285
Lieutenant Harris, I've changed
my mind. I want to be a cop.

746
01:01:52.459 --> 01:01:55.418
- Never, punk.
- Why not? All I have to do is behave--

747
01:01:55.587 --> 01:01:57.624
Get out of this car, Mahoney.
You hear me?

748
01:01:57.797 --> 01:02:02.258
You get. Get, Mahoney.
You get out there and you follow me.

749
01:02:02.427 --> 01:02:04.965
You stay right behind me, punk.

750
01:02:11.645 --> 01:02:14.058
Oh, how I love a ride in the country.

751
01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:25.614
Officer. Officer.

752
01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:28.618
Can you get my kitty-cat out of the tree?

753
01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.413
No problem, ma'am.

754
01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.494
Oh, no. No, wait.

755
01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:44.258
What the hell is this?

756
01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:54.511
I'll be right back. I'm sorry.

757
01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:05.863
What the hell is going on down there?

758
01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:08.278
Move it!

759
01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:12.361
Assholes.

760
01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:14.993
Hey! Hey, you, give me that bike.

761
01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:19.456
Come on, move it. This is official
police business. Move it out. Let's go.

762
01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:22.042
- It's new.
- Don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt it.

763
01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:26.668
Whoa!

764
01:03:40.692 --> 01:03:42.558
My God.

765
01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:45.068
Someone call a veterinarian.

766
01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:53.239
Your new hat, sir.

767
01:04:07.218 --> 01:04:09.255
You told no one?

768
01:04:09.429 --> 01:04:11.341
Not a soul.

769
01:05:13.618 --> 01:05:17.111
Hightower? Hightower?

770
01:05:17.288 --> 01:05:18.529
I need to talk.

771
01:05:18.706 --> 01:05:20.743
That's terrific, Hightower, but it's, uh...

772
01:05:21.209 --> 01:05:24.418
It's 2:30 in the morning.

773
01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:27.671
- The driving course is tomorrow.
- So?

774
01:05:27.841 --> 01:05:29.628
I haven't driven a car since I was 12.

775
01:05:29.801 --> 01:05:31.417
Really? You're kidding.

776
01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:36.339
If I don't pass this driving course,
they're gonna kick me out. Harris said so.

777
01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:41.643
All right. Let's go.

778
01:05:43.064 --> 01:05:45.226
Sleeping is for fags.

779
01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:49.519
First thing we gotta do is steal a car.
Copeland's should do.

780
01:05:53.867 --> 01:05:55.779
Okay, your turn.

781
01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:58.490
Now, you've got to remember
to drive defensively...

782
01:05:58.663 --> 01:06:03.203
...or offensively, depending
on your needs. Let's go.

783
01:06:11.342 --> 01:06:13.004
Comfy?

784
01:06:13.553 --> 01:06:14.885
- No.
- All right.

785
01:06:15.054 --> 01:06:17.387
Let's just move the seat back a little.

786
01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:21.050
On second thought, let's rip
the front seats out and sit in the back.

787
01:06:36.534 --> 01:06:39.368
I was kidding about the front seat.
But this is good.

788
01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:41.870
It's different. Comfort's important.

789
01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:50.330
Put it into first. Right. Little more.
Okay, you can go a little faster now.

790
01:06:51.424 --> 01:06:56.761
Yeah. Yeah, you're doing beautifully.
You feel it? You feel what's going on?

791
01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:59.547
You can even
turn off the windshield wipers.

792
01:07:00.475 --> 01:07:02.432
Yeah, that's it.

793
01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:05.974
Okay, now there's another car.

794
01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:09.852
Hightower?

795
01:07:11.236 --> 01:07:14.729
Hightow--? What--?
You didn't hit the brakes.

796
01:07:14.906 --> 01:07:17.023
You didn't tell me to.

797
01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.782
You idiot!

798
01:07:18.952 --> 01:07:22.070
You bastard! You dumb shit!

799
01:07:33.508 --> 01:07:36.376
- Pull over and let me drive for a while.
- No, not now.

800
01:07:36.553 --> 01:07:38.169
This is fun.

801
01:07:41.015 --> 01:07:43.723
- Pull over.
- No, I'm getting out of here.

802
01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:13.499
Holy shit!

803
01:08:37.655 --> 01:08:38.987
Attaboy, Hightower.

804
01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.377
Taught him everything he knows.

805
01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:07.091
Not bad.

806
01:09:07.352 --> 01:09:08.934
Not bad.

807
01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:12.062
Miss Hooks, you're next.

808
01:09:12.231 --> 01:09:13.392
Hurry up!

809
01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:16.058
Thanks, Mahoney. You saved my life.

810
01:09:16.235 --> 01:09:18.818
- Maybe someday you'll save mine.
- Any time.

811
01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:21.150
You're next. Yellow line. Yellow line.

812
01:09:21.699 --> 01:09:24.066
<i>You better not cry</i>

813
01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:28.738
<i>You better not pout
I'm telling you why</i>

814
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:49.925
Wee!

815
01:09:50.103 --> 01:09:51.435
Oh, this is fun.

816
01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:58.066
Ow! Ow! Ow!

817
01:09:58.236 --> 01:10:00.102
What is it? What is it?

818
01:10:00.279 --> 01:10:02.236
She ran over my feet.

819
01:10:02.407 --> 01:10:04.774
I'm sorry. I really am.

820
01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:08.865
Sorry? You dumb, fat jigaboo!

821
01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:14.074
Oh, shit.

822
01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:20.798
Oh, shit.

823
01:10:20.967 --> 01:10:23.300
- At ease, Hightower. At ease.
- It's okay, Hightower.

824
01:10:23.469 --> 01:10:26.837
- He didn't mean it. He was joking.
- Take it easy, now. Hightower!

825
01:10:27.014 --> 01:10:28.505
Hightower, don't do that.

826
01:10:28.683 --> 01:10:33.803
If you don't stop, you are out of here.
I am warning you, Hightower!

827
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:46.824
You messed up big, mister.

828
01:10:46.993 --> 01:10:51.328
Now you get your stuff
and get out of here, right now.

829
01:10:52.331 --> 01:10:53.617
Get!

830
01:10:57.003 --> 01:10:59.541
<i>Attention,
applications for motorcycle service...</i>

831
01:10:59.714 --> 01:11:03.048
<i>...should be turned in
at the Administration building by Friday.</i>

832
01:11:03.217 --> 01:11:05.925
<i>Applications for motorcycle service
should be turned in...</i>

833
01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:09.088
One down, several to go.

834
01:11:16.481 --> 01:11:18.939
Copeland, get out of that car.

835
01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:29.699
Mahoney.

836
01:11:32.163 --> 01:11:33.995
It's got to be Mahoney.

837
01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:39.619
I know, I know. Come on.

838
01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:47.339
Out of all the people I thought would
make it, Hightower was the one.

839
01:11:47.845 --> 01:11:51.213
I mean, if all the cops looked like him,
there'd be no crime at all.

840
01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:54.057
I'm getting sick of this place.

841
01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:57.061
How're you doing, "Ma-homo"?

842
01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:59.221
Don't fool with me.
Not in the mood.

843
01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:00.889
You wrecked my car.

844
01:12:01.067 --> 01:12:04.731
No, Hightower did. Why don't you
go see him? That'd be a matchup.

845
01:12:04.904 --> 01:12:07.021
Because we want you.

846
01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:11.071
Okay, how about, uh, 12:00 midnight?
Nine o'clock on the coast.

847
01:12:11.244 --> 01:12:15.614
No, no. I'm talking right now, Mahoney.
Let's go. You throw the first punch.

848
01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:17.330
Cadet could get thrown out...

849
01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.992
- ...for hitting another cadet.
- Oh, really?

850
01:12:20.545 --> 01:12:23.208
I thought you wanted to get thrown out.

851
01:12:23.381 --> 01:12:25.247
Here's your chance.

852
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:28.967
No.

853
01:12:30.388 --> 01:12:34.598
Now, Mahoney, I'm going to rub this
right in your face.

854
01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:36.349
On your mark...

855
01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:38.385
...get set--

856
01:12:50.616 --> 01:12:53.199
- Wait, you guys! Wait!
- What the hell--?

857
01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:56.157
Who threw the first punch?

858
01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:58.743
- That's all I want to know.
- Barbara did.

859
01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:01.579
- Barbara?
- That's right, sir.

860
01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:05.666
Then he's out of here.
Him and his queer dog.

861
01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:09.129
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Barbara didn't throw the first punch.

862
01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:10.793
- He did so.
- I threw the punch.

863
01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:13.178
Mahoney, you're out
of your mind. Lieutenant--

864
01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:17.432
- Blankes, who'd you rather have out?
- Is that true, Blankes?

865
01:13:19.145 --> 01:13:21.512
Did Mahoney start it?

866
01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:26.976
Yes, sir. Mahoney started it.

867
01:13:28.112 --> 01:13:32.026
Then, Mahoney, my little piss-ant...

868
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:35.863
...you are out of the Academy...

869
01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:37.986
...forever.

870
01:13:39.874 --> 01:13:41.706
Get your stuff.

871
01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:44.251
And get out.

872
01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:47.003
Too bad, so sad, bye-bye.

873
01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:03.849
Does the radio bother you?

874
01:14:07.026 --> 01:14:09.063
I could turn it down.

875
01:14:16.369 --> 01:14:18.452
Here, I brought you an apple.

876
01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:21.408
Thanks.

877
01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:28.829
Hey, man, what--?

878
01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:32.333
Whoa!

879
01:14:49.694 --> 01:14:52.402
My God. Here, take this.

880
01:14:52.571 --> 01:14:55.154
Hey, free TV's.

881
01:15:00.371 --> 01:15:03.364
Hey, everybody! There's a riot going on.

882
01:15:08.963 --> 01:15:11.831
My livelihood! You're ruining me!

883
01:15:12.008 --> 01:15:14.921
What do you got there?
What are you doing with that TV?

884
01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:24.551
- Hi. Want a ride?
- No, thanks.

885
01:15:39.285 --> 01:15:40.821
Hey, did you two hear the news...

886
01:15:40.995 --> 01:15:42.486
- ...on the radio?
- No.

887
01:15:42.663 --> 01:15:45.622
- A riot's broken out downtown.
- How come?

888
01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:47.578
Who knows how these things get started?

889
01:15:47.752 --> 01:15:49.994
<i>Attention! All cadets report immediately...</i>

890
01:15:50.171 --> 01:15:51.787
<i>...to the parking lot in full riot gear.</i>

891
01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:55.958
<i>Repeat, all cadets report immediately
to the parking lot in full riot gear.</i>

892
01:15:56.135 --> 01:15:57.296
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

893
01:15:57.470 --> 01:16:00.304
- Jones! Was that you?
- No, man.

894
01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:04.050
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

895
01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:08.937
Get out there fast!
Move it, move it, move it!

896
01:16:09.648 --> 01:16:11.105
Let's go, let's go.

897
01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:28.536
This is it. This is the big one.

898
01:16:29.293 --> 01:16:31.034
It's time this cop...

899
01:16:31.212 --> 01:16:33.374
...met the public.

900
01:16:39.178 --> 01:16:42.842
All right, listen up.
Here's the situation. There is a state...

901
01:16:43.015 --> 01:16:46.224
...of general disorder
in the Oakfield section of town.

902
01:16:46.393 --> 01:16:48.510
Real police are handling the problem.

903
01:16:48.687 --> 01:16:51.851
We are being sent
to a peripheral safe area.

904
01:16:52.024 --> 01:16:55.859
Our job will be merely to divert traffic
away from the trouble zone...

905
01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:58.315
...and to protect public property.

906
01:16:58.489 --> 01:17:00.105
You will have live ammunition...

907
01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:02.194
...but there will be no call to use it.

908
01:17:02.368 --> 01:17:06.203
Tackleberry, do you understand,
numb nuts?

909
01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:07.908
Yes, sir.

910
01:17:15.756 --> 01:17:17.543
Come on!

911
01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:24.838
We are now entering
the expressway at Belmont.

912
01:17:25.432 --> 01:17:28.391
Very good. Your bus is to deploy
on Sixteenth Street...

913
01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:30.518
<i>...between 4th and 8th Avenues.</i>

914
01:17:30.688 --> 01:17:33.021
Sixteenth Street? Are you sure, sir?

915
01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:35.648
Of course I'm sure.
I never forget a number.

916
01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:38.272
Yes, sir.

917
01:17:38.445 --> 01:17:40.357
There's nobody around.

918
01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:43.906
I guess they're hiding.

919
01:17:56.213 --> 01:17:59.377
All right, let's go, dirtbags, unload it.
Let's move it.

920
01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:02.293
I want two lines right here.
Come on, dummies.

921
01:18:02.469 --> 01:18:05.837
Let's go, let's go.

922
01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:11.760
You, one block over, one block up.

923
01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:14.145
You, one block down.

924
01:18:15.399 --> 01:18:18.642
You, one block up. You, one block over.

925
01:18:18.819 --> 01:18:23.109
You, one block over. Let's go. Let's go.

926
01:18:23.282 --> 01:18:25.490
If you have to make an arrest...

927
01:18:25.659 --> 01:18:28.276
...do it as quietly as possible.

928
01:18:30.831 --> 01:18:33.289
Boy, it sure is quiet around here, huh?

929
01:18:48.974 --> 01:18:51.307
Hey, Fackler. How's it going?

930
01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:53.343
Oh, just fine, thanks.

931
01:18:56.148 --> 01:18:59.312
- What the hell are you doing here?
- We're from the Academy.

932
01:18:59.485 --> 01:19:03.399
You're supposed to be blocks away.
The damn riot's right down this street.

933
01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:05.438
We're pulling out.

934
01:19:07.701 --> 01:19:11.741
I love sushi. I'm into back-rubs,
all kinds of Japanese stuff.

935
01:19:11.914 --> 01:19:14.156
My car stereo, it's a Sony.

936
01:19:14.333 --> 01:19:17.576
I got a good friend, his father was killed
at Pearl Harbor.

937
01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:21.497
Hey, maybe your family had
something to do with it?

938
01:19:21.674 --> 01:19:23.506
You know sake? The wine?

939
01:19:23.676 --> 01:19:27.545
I know a place where they heat it up
before they serve it.

940
01:19:28.472 --> 01:19:30.088
Holy shit.

941
01:19:30.266 --> 01:19:32.508
I got to go now.

942
01:19:41.068 --> 01:19:42.809
Run!

943
01:20:11.515 --> 01:20:15.350
Hello, men. I thought I'd come by
for a personal inspection.

944
01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:18.478
- Okay if we get in, sir?
- I guess so.

945
01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:21.731
Sure, why not?
Well, men, how's it going?

946
01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.813
I want you to give me a fix
on the entire situation.

947
01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:26.603
Not that good, sir.

948
01:20:27.072 --> 01:20:30.656
Oh, so this is very, very, very bad.

949
01:20:31.785 --> 01:20:33.902
The main thing is not to panic.

950
01:20:39.585 --> 01:20:41.952
Attention! Attention, everybody.

951
01:20:42.129 --> 01:20:47.249
Attention. This is Commandant
Eric Lassard of the Police Academy.

952
01:20:47.426 --> 01:20:50.635
If you do not disperse immediately,
my men will have to arrest you.

953
01:20:50.804 --> 01:20:56.766
You have five seconds to move away.
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

954
01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:01.266
Give me the thing.

955
01:21:37.309 --> 01:21:39.596
You should park cars for a living, sir.

956
01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:48.393
Anybody want any of this?

957
01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:50.232
You want this? You'd die for this.

958
01:21:50.406 --> 01:21:52.398
- You're not so tough now.
- Come and take it.

959
01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:54.907
- How about you? You want this?
- What's the matter?

960
01:21:55.077 --> 01:21:59.287
- I'm talking to you, twerp.
- Just too dumb to talk, huh?

961
01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:29.980
Damn it. Look, in here.

962
01:22:32.489 --> 01:22:34.071
Try this one.

963
01:22:41.373 --> 01:22:45.913
Help. Help.
This is Cadet Leslie Barbara. Help.

964
01:22:46.086 --> 01:22:49.124
Barbara, this is Lt. Harris.

965
01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:50.539
Just calm down.

966
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:53.917
I'm being chased by 30 rioters.

967
01:22:55.512 --> 01:22:57.549
Barbara, just tell me where you are.

968
01:22:57.723 --> 01:22:59.840
I'm passing you now, sir.

969
01:23:04.521 --> 01:23:06.638
Holy shit.

970
01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:14.066
Hi.

971
01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:21.035
Get the cops!

972
01:23:38.514 --> 01:23:39.550
Uh...

973
01:23:42.601 --> 01:23:45.344
Okay. Hold it right there, guys.

974
01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:47.433
Why, if it isn't Leslie Barbara...

975
01:23:47.606 --> 01:23:50.098
- ...the police officer.
- Yeah.

976
01:23:50.901 --> 01:23:53.143
Come on, Les,
you're not going to shoot us.

977
01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:56.404
You wouldn't shoot old friends,
would you?

978
01:24:01.954 --> 01:24:03.536
No.

979
01:24:04.456 --> 01:24:05.947
Les.

980
01:24:06.959 --> 01:24:09.201
Get lost. We're busy.

981
01:24:26.812 --> 01:24:31.603
Now, get the furniture back up there
and get out of the area.

982
01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:34.358
But it's our furniture.

983
01:24:35.696 --> 01:24:37.153
Oh.

984
01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:39.526
Sorry.

985
01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:54.458
Callahan calling Harris. Come in, please.

986
01:24:54.631 --> 01:24:56.213
Harris, come in.

987
01:24:59.219 --> 01:25:00.585
Where the hell is Harris?

988
01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:02.845
- I don't know.
- What?

989
01:25:03.015 --> 01:25:05.098
- She doesn't know.
- I heard her.

990
01:25:08.186 --> 01:25:09.722
Run!

991
01:25:19.531 --> 01:25:21.067
Why don't you shoot back?

992
01:25:25.871 --> 01:25:27.954
- Are those gunshots?
- Fucking A.

993
01:25:30.167 --> 01:25:32.750
Shoot back. Come on.

994
01:25:34.671 --> 01:25:37.334
Look up there. See? See?

995
01:25:37.507 --> 01:25:39.840
That looks like Harris up there.

996
01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:41.842
Should we shoot back?

997
01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:45.050
Hmm.

998
01:25:46.266 --> 01:25:47.882
Hmm.

999
01:25:48.727 --> 01:25:50.434
I don't think so.

1000
01:25:54.232 --> 01:25:55.768
Come on!

1001
01:25:58.528 --> 01:25:59.860
Stay there.

1002
01:26:01.073 --> 01:26:02.530
Mahoney!

1003
01:26:03.075 --> 01:26:05.442
Oh, shit. Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.

1004
01:26:06.953 --> 01:26:09.787
I'll bet there's a back door to this place.

1005
01:26:09.956 --> 01:26:13.165
Hooks. Hooks!
Hooks, get the hell back here.

1006
01:26:13.335 --> 01:26:15.201
That's an order.

1007
01:27:09.015 --> 01:27:10.472
Freeze!

1008
01:27:11.852 --> 01:27:13.809
Oh, shit.

1009
01:27:40.839 --> 01:27:42.501
Don't move, you bastard.

1010
01:27:42.674 --> 01:27:45.792
Run, Thompson! Run!

1011
01:27:47.888 --> 01:27:48.924
Put the gun down.

1012
01:27:50.348 --> 01:27:52.431
Let's say you put your gun down.

1013
01:27:55.854 --> 01:27:59.768
Lieutenant Harris, any last-minute
tips or suggestions?

1014
01:28:02.152 --> 01:28:03.893
Nothing really comes to mind.

1015
01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:08.072
What's it gonna be?

1016
01:28:12.162 --> 01:28:14.199
Throw your gun over the ledge.

1017
01:28:16.541 --> 01:28:18.282
I got two piglet-wigglets.

1018
01:28:20.670 --> 01:28:22.377
Hey!

1019
01:28:22.881 --> 01:28:24.213
What do you want?

1020
01:28:25.175 --> 01:28:27.462
I want to watch you off these pigs.

1021
01:28:33.642 --> 01:28:36.225
Sure. Ha, ha. Sure.

1022
01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:45.817
- Which one do we do first?
- Hmm.

1023
01:28:54.454 --> 01:28:56.286
I believe I'd shoot this one.

1024
01:28:56.456 --> 01:28:57.697
Yeah, the old one.

1025
01:29:06.925 --> 01:29:11.545
- Looks like cadet revolvers to me.
- I know those guys.

1026
01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:18.638
Don't move, dirtbag!

1027
01:29:44.963 --> 01:29:47.171
Hey. Aw. Hey, hey.

1028
01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:49.423
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What's wrong with this man?

1029
01:29:49.593 --> 01:29:52.256
There was gunplay, sir, and he missed it.

1030
01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:07.024
- Lieutenant Harris? Captain Reed.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

1031
01:30:07.193 --> 01:30:10.311
Thank you. I also want to thank you
for looking out for Mahoney.

1032
01:30:10.488 --> 01:30:12.901
It was an honor and a pleasure, sir.

1033
01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:15.111
Thank you, sir. Ha, ha.

1034
01:30:21.958 --> 01:30:23.995
- Could you just--?
- This woman bothering you?

1035
01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:27.207
What? Uh, no. This is my mother.

1036
01:30:28.465 --> 01:30:30.798
Ten-four. Carry on.

1037
01:30:30.967 --> 01:30:32.754
- Oh, my precious--
- Mom, would--?

1038
01:30:33.136 --> 01:30:35.298
- Then at 8:00 you'll meet my mother.
- Right.

1039
01:30:35.472 --> 01:30:38.010
- You'd better have some flowers.
- Flowers, check.

1040
01:30:41.978 --> 01:30:43.435
You men, stop that.

1041
01:30:47.776 --> 01:30:49.733
Oh, well, ha, ha.

1042
01:30:49.903 --> 01:30:51.565
That's more like it, Mahoney.

1043
01:30:52.364 --> 01:30:54.731
Good man. Keep up the good work.

1044
01:30:55.408 --> 01:30:56.865
Thank you, sir.

1045
01:30:57.035 --> 01:31:01.245
Ladies and gentlemen, the commandant
of the Academy, Eric Lassard.

1046
01:31:08.004 --> 01:31:11.418
So many unusual events have happened
to this graduating class...

1047
01:31:11.591 --> 01:31:13.298
...and to me, also.

1048
01:31:13.468 --> 01:31:16.927
I could tell you many, many stories,
but instead...

1049
01:31:17.097 --> 01:31:19.305
...I have a presentation to make.

1050
01:31:19.474 --> 01:31:23.013
No Academy cadet has ever received
the highest award...

1051
01:31:23.186 --> 01:31:25.143
...this police department has to make.

1052
01:31:25.647 --> 01:31:27.764
Today, there are two:

1053
01:31:27.941 --> 01:31:31.309
Officers Moses Hightower...

1054
01:31:32.195 --> 01:31:34.152
...and Carey Mahoney.

1055
01:31:34.322 --> 01:31:36.564
Gentlemen, please step forward.

1056
01:32:12.152 --> 01:32:14.565
You are both expected
to make a few short remarks.

1057
01:32:17.782 --> 01:32:20.274
Officer Hightower.

1058
01:32:25.957 --> 01:32:27.448
Thanks.

1059
01:32:29.919 --> 01:32:32.787
That was very, very, very good.

1060
01:32:33.298 --> 01:32:35.290
Officer Mahoney.

1061
01:32:40.722 --> 01:32:43.965
Thank you, Commandant Lassard,
Chief Hurnst...

1062
01:32:44.142 --> 01:32:46.600
...Madam Mayor, Mr. President...

1063
01:32:46.770 --> 01:32:50.309
...His Holiness the Pope,
the King of Norway...

1064
01:32:50.482 --> 01:32:52.474
...and our other honored guests.
