00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.938
Hello...

2
00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.379
Tackleberry.

3
00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.539
We're all gonna miss you around here.

4
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.579
The Police Academy's getting itself
a real fine recruit.

5
00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.939
May I...

6
00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:09.778
go now?

7
00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.459
Affirmative, sir.

8
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.578
Ten-four.

9
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.818
Yes, of course. Ten-four.

10
00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.019
You guys.

11
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.818
Surprise.

12
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.979
Lot's full, mister.

13
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.178
Look, don't give me that crap.

14
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.139
- You've got a space.
- The lot's full, sir, really.

15
00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.459
Find a spot, dickhead.

16
00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:55.499
- Dickhead?
- That's right. Where's the manager?

17
00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:56.778
Dickhead?

18
00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.938
Park the car, butt breath.

19
00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.178
- Butt breath?
- Yeah.

20
00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.179
Wait a minute. Hold everything.
That's a wig, isn't it?

21
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.458
- Park the car.
- Yeah, that's a wig.

22
00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:09.938
Wig! Wig! Dong-dong-dong!

23
00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.779
- Wig alert! Wig alert! Dong-dong-dong!
- Park the car, asshole. Shut up.

24
00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.659
Girls. It's a rug.

25
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.299
What the hell's going on here?
Hi, Lou.

26
00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:20.819
- Lou?
- This rude little punk won't park my car.

27
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.619
Mahoney, park this car.

28
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.058
Take a look.
If you can find a spot...

29
00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:27.259
Do it now or you're fired.
You understand? Fired.

30
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.579
Fired? That's not fair,
the guy has a bad attitude.

31
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.099
Do it, okay?

32
00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.978
I want you to apologize to this man,
then park his car.

33
00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:39.578
Yes, sir.

34
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.739
- I'm sorry.
- Get out of here.

35
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.738
And clean the ashtray while you're at it.

36
00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:54.819
Yeah, I'm sorry, Lou. You just can't get
good help these days.

37
00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.099
Respect for anything.
They don't respect customers.

38
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.018
They don't respect property.
They don't respect respect.

39
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.738
Holy shit. Jesus.

40
00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:14.938
It fits. Damn thing fits.

41
00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.378
I thought there were no more spaces.
Am I an idiot or what?

42
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.778
Hi, fellas.

43
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.618
Hey, guys, just...

44
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.059
Hey, hey!

45
00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:55.778
Guys, I don't think I'm supposed
to get the photos wet.

46
00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:08.018
You're going to pay for this.
Mark my words.

47
00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:11.008
And you want to know why?

48
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.779
I'll let you know why. It's no secret.
Everybody knows.

49
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.078
I'm joining the police force.

50
00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.119
What do you think of that, huh?

51
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.979
Now who's in charge?

52
00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:34.299
Hey, sarge, it's him again.

53
00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:36.818
I'll call Captain Reed.
Sit over there, Mahoney.

54
00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:38.578
All right, let's go.

55
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.458
Sit. And stay there.

56
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.898
- What are you in for?
- I'll show you.

57
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.659
Goddamn it! Stop that!

58
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.219
Oh, no, sir. No, not you.

59
00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:09.058
That's terrific. Really.

60
00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:13.178
- What's your name?
- Jones. Larvell Jones.

61
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.659
Monsignor Larvell Jones.

62
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:16.858
M.D.

63
00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:19.058
- Let's go, Mahoney.
- See you around, monsignor.

64
00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:21.498
Doctor monsignor.

65
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.298
Why can't you stay out of trouble?

66
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.019
I mean...

67
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.219
What's wrong with you?
Disturbing the peace.

68
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.898
Destroying private property.

69
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.578
And I'm getting tired of saving your butt.

70
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.379
I only do it because of your father.

71
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.538
- He was a good friend.
- Yeah, I know.

72
00:07:55.699 --> 00:07:58.138
Now, Mahoney, I've made a decision.

73
00:07:58.299 --> 00:08:00.578
I ain't gonna help you this time.

74
00:08:00.739 --> 00:08:03.498
You're going to the county lockup.

75
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.459
Lockup?

76
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.419
Why? I didn't do anything really major.

77
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.258
- Then I'll make a deal with you.
- Anything.

78
00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:15.138
I want you to go to the Police Academy.

79
00:08:15.299 --> 00:08:17.019
The Police Academy?

80
00:08:17.179 --> 00:08:20.098
Even if you never graduate,
the training will be good for you.

81
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.738
Wait a minute.

82
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.778
Wait a minute. Reed?

83
00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:27.338
Listen, you've seen the commercials
on TV.

84
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.139
The Academy's taking
all kinds these days.

85
00:08:31.899 --> 00:08:33.818
Anybody can get in.

86
00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.138
Even you.

87
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.539
No deal. That's nuts.

88
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.338
Well, it's either that or the lockup.

89
00:08:41.739 --> 00:08:45.018
- Police Academy or jail.
- Will I get my own squad car?

90
00:08:45.179 --> 00:08:48.699
You'll get 14 weeks of Academy training
and discipline...

91
00:08:48.859 --> 00:08:51.819
- Starting Monday morning.
- Fourteen weeks.

92
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.098
Oh, they can throw you out.

93
00:08:54.259 --> 00:08:57.059
But you can't quit.
You quit, and you're back in jail.

94
00:08:57.219 --> 00:08:59.219
That's the deal.

95
00:08:59.699 --> 00:09:01.618
- Can I bring a friend?
- Who?

96
00:09:01.779 --> 00:09:03.818
Monsignor Larvell Jones,
my personal physician.

97
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.698
You decide.

98
00:09:07.819 --> 00:09:10.859
Honey, please don't go. I love you.
I don't want to see you hurt.

99
00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.178
I worry about you.
You're so accident-prone.

100
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.699
And the Police Academy
is such a dangerous place.

101
00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.139
Honey, don't worry. I'll be okay.

102
00:09:19.299 --> 00:09:20.619
Everything'll be okay.

103
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.059
You start that car
and you're a dead man, buster.

104
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.538
Honey, I'm late.

105
00:09:24.699 --> 00:09:28.859
You pull out of that driveway
and I'll have your head on a pole.

106
00:09:30.979 --> 00:09:33.738
Come back here, you turkey!

107
00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.739
You move this car an inch
and you're finished, mister. You hear me?

108
00:10:14.059 --> 00:10:18.298
Of all the things that you could be
in this world, why a policeman?

109
00:10:18.459 --> 00:10:21.499
A policewoman, mother.

110
00:10:22.819 --> 00:10:23.819
But why?

111
00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.059
Because it's exciting, it's different.

112
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.698
It'll give me a chance to meet
interesting and unusual people.

113
00:10:28.859 --> 00:10:30.778
Right now! If you don't pull over...

114
00:10:30.939 --> 00:10:33.419
People who aren't like you and me.

115
00:11:15.459 --> 00:11:17.978
- Hey, look, it's the chief.
- Really?

116
00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.738
Hey, mention my name.

117
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.578
Cadet Kyle Blankes
reporting for duty, sir.

118
00:11:26.739 --> 00:11:28.778
Get away from me, you asshole.

119
00:11:28.939 --> 00:11:30.219
Yes, sir.

120
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:51.059
- Where are we, man?
- Ecuador.

121
00:11:54.699 --> 00:11:59.059
Okay! Oh, here we are.
I got to go now. Bye.

122
00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:02.258
- Bye, sweet-pea. Bye, cutie-pie.
- We'll miss you.

123
00:12:02.419 --> 00:12:04.698
- Okay.
- Bye!

124
00:12:04.859 --> 00:12:08.258
Okay, girls. Remember, I love yous.

125
00:12:08.419 --> 00:12:11.099
- Bye!
- Introduce yourself around, man.

126
00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:17.299
Bye! Bye, babies. Goodbye.

127
00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:19.619
Hey, excuse me.

128
00:12:19.779 --> 00:12:21.338
- Do you know all those women?
- Sure.

129
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.179
- They're my girlfriends.
- All of them?

130
00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.059
- Yeah.
- Carey Mahoney.

131
00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.658
I'm George Martin, Carey.

132
00:12:26.819 --> 00:12:28.899
We should be pals.
You're an interesting guy.

133
00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.459
You a cadet?

134
00:12:30.619 --> 00:12:32.659
I am until I can get myself
thrown out of here.

135
00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:33.818
I'll be gone by 10:00.

136
00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.378
You, like, joined the Academy
to get thrown out?

137
00:12:36.539 --> 00:12:37.539
That's right.

138
00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.339
Hey, you're a pretty interesting guy
yourself.

139
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.058
Look at that.

140
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.899
Just look at that.

141
00:12:54.379 --> 00:12:57.938
Look at that scum.
When I went through this academy...

142
00:12:58.099 --> 00:13:00.859
every cadet was the right weight,
the right height, color...

143
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.459
and they all had Johnsons, Lassard.

144
00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.699
Every single one of them.

145
00:13:05.859 --> 00:13:06.858
Johnsons?

146
00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.178
You know...

147
00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:11.979
Oh, yes.

148
00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:16.819
Back in the old days, there were Johnsons
as far as the eye could see.

149
00:13:16.979 --> 00:13:19.738
And what a lovely sight it was.

150
00:13:20.859 --> 00:13:22.939
Have you seen these applications?

151
00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.098
Have you seen what our new lady mayor
has brought us?

152
00:13:28.259 --> 00:13:30.298
Do you know she is attempting
to dismantle...

153
00:13:30.459 --> 00:13:33.738
one of this country's great institutions
of law and order?

154
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.218
What do you say to that, Lassard?

155
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.299
The bitch.

156
00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.378
- Commandant?
- Yes, chief.

157
00:13:41.539 --> 00:13:45.019
The mayor says we've got
to take this flotsam.

158
00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.698
But that doesn't mean
we have to put them on the force.

159
00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.578
You get my drift?

160
00:13:50.739 --> 00:13:54.138
Weed the undesirables out.

161
00:13:54.299 --> 00:13:56.699
- Get rid of them.
- No problem, chief.

162
00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.698
We'll start washing them out
this morning.

163
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.499
We don't throw them out.

164
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.859
They must be encouraged to quit
on their own.

165
00:14:04.019 --> 00:14:07.858
- Do you understand?
- I think I understand, sir.

166
00:14:08.019 --> 00:14:11.379
Thank you, Lieutenant Harris,
I'm sure you do.

167
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.058
- Lassard?
- What?

168
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.299
Do you understand?

169
00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.339
- It's clear as glass, chief.
- Good.

170
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.099
Then we all know what to do.

171
00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:48.898
That's it...

172
00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.819
There sure are a lot
of spades around here.

173
00:15:00.139 --> 00:15:02.058
Which I think is good.

174
00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.299
Very good for the Academy.

175
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.059
What the hell are you doing here?

176
00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.179
I want to be a police officer.

177
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:14.138
What? I can't hear you.

178
00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:18.459
I want to be a police officer.

179
00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.059
- Don't unpack.
- Well...

180
00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.019
Time to get thrown out.

181
00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.778
Princess. Princess! Prin...!

182
00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.539
- What's your name, Cadet?
- Thompson, sir.

183
00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.258
- You live around here?
- No, sir.

184
00:15:34.419 --> 00:15:36.259
What's your telephone number,
Thompson?

185
00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.619
Come on, eyes front. Telephone number.

186
00:15:38.779 --> 00:15:41.018
5-5-5-2-4-6-7, sir.

187
00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.979
Okay, let's see the thighs.

188
00:15:44.139 --> 00:15:48.059
Come on, come on. I haven't got all day.
The thighs.

189
00:15:49.619 --> 00:15:52.619
- What in the hell are you doing?
- Meeting women, sir.

190
00:15:52.779 --> 00:15:55.138
What's your name, dirtbag?

191
00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.298
- Dirtbag?
- Your name?

192
00:15:57.459 --> 00:15:59.059
Mahoney, sir.

193
00:15:59.219 --> 00:16:00.419
Back in line, Mahoney.

194
00:16:00.579 --> 00:16:03.699
Sir, can I have a second with you?
Listen...

195
00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.859
I don't really belong here.
I'm not right for this.

196
00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:10.419
Get back in line.

197
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.179
Now!

198
00:16:14.619 --> 00:16:17.659
Mom, it's all right. Don't worry.
Come here, Princess.

199
00:16:47.099 --> 00:16:51.098
My name is Commandant Lassard.
Welcome to the new police force.

200
00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.259
Your training time here will last...

201
00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.858
Fourteen.

202
00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.898
Fourteen weeks.

203
00:16:59.059 --> 00:17:03.179
You will be schooled in firearms,
police procedures, local laws...

204
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.139
and many, many other things.

205
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.539
After those 12 weeks,
some of you will be police officers...

206
00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.219
and some of you will not.

207
00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.579
Some of you will be...

208
00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.818
Here at the Academy...

209
00:17:16.059 --> 00:17:17.779
Here at the Academy...

210
00:17:17.939 --> 00:17:19.659
you will learn...

211
00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.378
you will learn...

212
00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.819
Princess. Princess. Come here.

213
00:17:23.979 --> 00:17:26.178
Princess?
Looks more like a prince to me.

214
00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.739
- Give me that dog.
- But he's mine, sir.

215
00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.058
He's a queer.

216
00:17:32.219 --> 00:17:36.618
Cadets, proceed to the supply room
and draw your uniforms.

217
00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.738
Fall out. Let's go. Move it.
Move it, move it, move it.

218
00:17:45.659 --> 00:17:48.339
- Next.
- What about guns? When do we get guns?

219
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.939
Next.

220
00:17:50.859 --> 00:17:53.819
- I'm a size 9, sometimes a size 10.
- Next.

221
00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:05.378
Hey! You three dirtbags report
to the Academy barber...

222
00:18:05.539 --> 00:18:06.979
before you do anything else.

223
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.499
Where's that?

224
00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.979
Find it, rat face.

225
00:18:11.139 --> 00:18:12.459
Rat face?

226
00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.418
- He probably meant the other guy.
- Oh, oh, okay.

227
00:18:15.579 --> 00:18:17.579
- What's that?
- That's where the commandant...

228
00:18:17.739 --> 00:18:19.739
- and his wife live.
- Nice.

229
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.219
Oh, excuse me.
Do you know where we get our clothes?

230
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.339
Yeah. You gotta go right over there.

231
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.938
Here? Okay, thanks.

232
00:18:27.099 --> 00:18:30.019
- Go in and tell them Mahoney sent you.
- Got it.

233
00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.739
- Be out of here by 3:00.
- Move it, dirtbag. I'm first.

234
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.899
And I'm next.

235
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:40.258
For important guys like you, I'll wait.

236
00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:46.298
Okay, let's go. Take it all off.

237
00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:47.618
You got it.

238
00:19:03.539 --> 00:19:04.579
Hello?

239
00:19:32.219 --> 00:19:37.339
- Just a little off the side, please.
- You bet.

240
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.658
- You can do that?
- Sure. This ain't the Army, you know.

241
00:19:45.659 --> 00:19:50.298
Let's go, let's go! We've got to find
you little babies a place to sleep.

242
00:19:50.459 --> 00:19:53.058
Better listen up, you fart-blossoms.

243
00:19:53.219 --> 00:19:56.898
- You sure you said Mahoney?
- Yeah, I even spelled it to her.

244
00:19:57.059 --> 00:19:58.698
- Copeland and Blankes, in here.
- Sir.

245
00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.659
This man is my personal physician.
I can't live without him, sir.

246
00:20:01.819 --> 00:20:04.458
Right down here,
I want Fackler and Martin.

247
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.139
I've known him since childhood...

248
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:10.898
- Right here, Mahoney and Tackleberry.
- Yes, sir! Thank you, sir!

249
00:20:12.979 --> 00:20:14.858
Thank you.
I've always wanted to live with a nut.

250
00:20:15.019 --> 00:20:17.178
My pleasure.

251
00:20:17.619 --> 00:20:20.058
- Mahoney, is it?
- Yes, sir. I'd like to say one more...

252
00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:24.058
The rest of you wimps come with me.
Move it, move it, move it.

253
00:20:24.219 --> 00:20:25.459
Wimps?

254
00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.099
- You're married, huh?
- Yeah.

255
00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.458
That's beautiful, man.

256
00:20:34.619 --> 00:20:36.698
To me, marriage is a sacred institution.

257
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.099
So tell me.

258
00:20:39.259 --> 00:20:41.858
You and the wife do it doggie-style
or what?

259
00:20:58.059 --> 00:21:00.258
Room ready for inspection, sir.

260
00:21:02.019 --> 00:21:03.339
Good haircuts, men.

261
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.299
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

262
00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.579
Damn good haircuts.

263
00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.419
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

264
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.018
Men...

265
00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.298
I've got a little problem.

266
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.219
It seems I've got a squad
full of scumbuckets.

267
00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.459
A whole big bunch of losers.

268
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.379
And I was kind of hoping
that you two fine, young cadets...

269
00:21:30.179 --> 00:21:33.018
might help me to just get rid of
a few of them.

270
00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:37.298
What do you say?
Will you help me out?

271
00:21:38.539 --> 00:21:41.179
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

272
00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:47.138
- Good.
- I'm Copeland, sir. Chad Copeland.

273
00:21:47.979 --> 00:21:49.539
Good for you.

274
00:21:52.499 --> 00:21:55.459
Hi, I'm Douglas Fackler.
I always wanted to be a cop.

275
00:22:11.179 --> 00:22:13.378
Lieutenant Hoffman, Lieutenant Hoffman...

276
00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.538
report immediately to the infirmary.

277
00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.979
Hey, Thompson. Well?

278
00:22:18.139 --> 00:22:20.699
- How do I look?
- That wasn't very funny this morning.

279
00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:23.258
Wasn't funny.
I'd give anything to see your thighs.

280
00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.418
Don't suppose you'd
describe them for me.

281
00:22:25.579 --> 00:22:29.938
Well, they're tan, of course.
Very supple, well-rounded...

282
00:22:30.099 --> 00:22:32.858
and luxuriant to the touch.

283
00:22:34.219 --> 00:22:36.938
Absolute silence!

284
00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:46.138
My name is Lt. Harris...

285
00:22:46.299 --> 00:22:48.578
in case you missed it.

286
00:22:52.339 --> 00:22:55.618
This is Sgt. Callahan...

287
00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.859
in case you missed it.

288
00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:01.979
We are the meanest instructors here.

289
00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:07.818
We've got you because
you are the worst people here.

290
00:23:09.739 --> 00:23:12.419
You people are D-Squad.

291
00:23:12.579 --> 00:23:15.019
D for dirtbags.

292
00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:19.898
When I say, hey, dirtbags,
that means you.

293
00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:24.378
You people are going to hate my guts
for the rest of your lives.

294
00:23:24.539 --> 00:23:29.419
I am going to make you sorry
that you ever came here.

295
00:23:29.779 --> 00:23:33.419
Now, it is traditional here at the Academy
for each squad...

296
00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:35.859
to have two student squad-leaders.

297
00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:40.659
I have chosen Cadets Blankes
and Dopeland. Step out, men.

298
00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.698
If these two cadets give you an order...

299
00:23:45.259 --> 00:23:48.378
obey it.

300
00:23:50.019 --> 00:23:53.338
Now, I thought it would be nice...

301
00:23:53.499 --> 00:23:57.219
if we were to close out
our first afternoon together...

302
00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:01.418
with a nice little stroll
around the campus.

303
00:24:06.379 --> 00:24:09.739
Move out, maggots!

304
00:24:15.979 --> 00:24:19.899
- Holy, shit.
- This is definitely not Ecuador.

305
00:24:23.619 --> 00:24:25.659
Get up, Barbara. Get up. Get up.

306
00:24:25.819 --> 00:24:27.259
Move it, move it, move it.

307
00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.739
I could show a movie on your butt, fatso.

308
00:24:30.899 --> 00:24:34.299
Nineteen. Twenty!

309
00:24:35.179 --> 00:24:39.059
More! I want more!

310
00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.579
Fifteen.

311
00:24:41.739 --> 00:24:43.699
Sixteen.

312
00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.978
Seventeen.

313
00:24:46.139 --> 00:24:50.739
Eighteen. Let's go. Let's go.

314
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:54.938
Nine. Ten.

315
00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.739
Attention. Lights out in 10 minutes.

316
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.739
Lights out in 10 minutes.

317
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.778
Asshole.

318
00:25:50.019 --> 00:25:53.618
Police work...

319
00:25:53.779 --> 00:25:56.699
is what...

320
00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:58.938
you are...

321
00:25:59.099 --> 00:26:02.938
here for.

322
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.579
Arrest...

323
00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:11.059
procedures...

324
00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:15.578
traffic violations...

325
00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.939
high-speed...

326
00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.179
driving...

327
00:26:20.339 --> 00:26:22.339
self-defense.

328
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:28.018
And you will have many examinations...

329
00:26:28.179 --> 00:26:31.578
which you must pass.

330
00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.739
Plus...

331
00:26:34.219 --> 00:26:38.419
you will endure an extremely rigorous
physical training program.

332
00:26:38.579 --> 00:26:41.498
Do you know what that means, Hooks?

333
00:26:42.739 --> 00:26:44.979
I'm not sure, sir.

334
00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.698
What?

335
00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.299
Voice commands.

336
00:26:51.459 --> 00:26:55.259
We will learn to use our voices
with authority.

337
00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:57.339
Won't we, Hooks?

338
00:27:00.539 --> 00:27:05.659
Now, have any of you
had any military training?

339
00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:13.818
I served with the U.S. Army
Airborne 209th Special Forces Unit.

340
00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:15.539
Anybody else?

341
00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:16.939
What?

342
00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:21.059
You have had prior
military training, Mahoney?

343
00:27:21.219 --> 00:27:24.258
- Well, yes, but not in this life, sir.
- What?

344
00:27:24.419 --> 00:27:27.339
In a previous life, I served
with Her Majesty's Forces in India.

345
00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:31.019
- Interesting sideline...
- If you're trying to get thrown out...

346
00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:33.259
I'm afraid that's quite impossible.

347
00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.699
Impossible?
What the hell's going on here?

348
00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.779
I'll have to see
the commandant about this.

349
00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:43.858
You will also learn the Municipal Code.
And you will learn them by heart.

350
00:27:44.419 --> 00:27:45.778
Cadet Mahoney. Cadet Mahoney.

351
00:27:45.939 --> 00:27:49.539
Report immediately to the commandant's
office. Cadet Mahoney.

352
00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:55.418
Okay, Mahoney, get going. On the double.
Move it. Move it. Move it.

353
00:27:57.619 --> 00:27:58.619
Now...

354
00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.499
Lieutenant Harris, Lieutenant Harris...

355
00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.458
report immediately to the firing range.
Lieutenant Harris.

356
00:28:05.299 --> 00:28:06.938
Excuse me.

357
00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.659
Callahan, take over.

358
00:28:11.859 --> 00:28:13.299
Howdy.

359
00:28:13.619 --> 00:28:15.859
- No one's allowed in here.
- Listen.

360
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.298
- I got a problem, chief.
- It's commandant.

361
00:28:18.459 --> 00:28:21.178
Commandant, I'm sorry.
Is that your fish?

362
00:28:21.339 --> 00:28:23.378
- No, it belongs to a friend.
- Very pretty.

363
00:28:23.539 --> 00:28:26.059
- What do you want?
- I want out of here. Right now.

364
00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.219
- Out of this office?
- No, out of the Academy.

365
00:28:29.379 --> 00:28:32.179
- That's no problem. You can just quit.
- I can't quit.

366
00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:34.939
Of course you can.
Many, many wonderful people...

367
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.058
- have quit many, many...
- Commandant?

368
00:28:37.619 --> 00:28:39.059
Do you know Capt. Reed?

369
00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:43.619
Oh, yes. Capt. Reed. You're Mahoney.

370
00:28:45.339 --> 00:28:48.738
Mahoney. Mahoney. Mahoney.

371
00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.578
- You're a special case. You can't quit.
- I know that.

372
00:28:52.739 --> 00:28:55.738
- On the other hand, I can't throw you out.
- Why not?

373
00:28:55.899 --> 00:28:59.738
I promised Capt. Reed. I promised
I'd keep you here the full 24 weeks.

374
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:03.859
You what? You what? You told...?

375
00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:06.499
He told me that I could...

376
00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:12.058
- I'm trapped here?
- Well, yes. We all are.

377
00:29:13.699 --> 00:29:16.499
Pick it up, pick it up.
Keep moving up that hill.

378
00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.059
Put some muscle in it.

379
00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:22.939
Get those knees up.
Get those knees up, come on!

380
00:29:34.139 --> 00:29:35.459
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

381
00:29:35.619 --> 00:29:37.379
This is definitely not for me.

382
00:29:42.939 --> 00:29:43.979
Keep going!

383
00:29:56.300 --> 00:30:01.178
Come on, Hooks, get over the wall.
Move it, move it, move it.

384
00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.899
Come on, Hooks, get up.

385
00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:08.899
Skip it. Go around. You'll never make it.
Why don't you quit now?

386
00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.858
Quit, quit, quit. You'll never make it.

387
00:30:12.019 --> 00:30:16.859
Sir, I'm terribly sorry,
but I seem to have ripped my pants.

388
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.778
Don't try me, punk.

389
00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:27.058
Now, wise guy...

390
00:30:27.219 --> 00:30:29.219
you run, don't trot...

391
00:30:29.379 --> 00:30:33.538
to the supply room,
and you get a new pair.

392
00:30:34.179 --> 00:30:36.499
Yes, sir. I'll be back later in the day.

393
00:30:36.659 --> 00:30:39.899
Be back in five minutes!

394
00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.779
Yes, sir. Shit, I'm deaf.

395
00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.419
Hey, you got any brown shoe-polish?

396
00:30:55.579 --> 00:30:57.098
I've got cordovan. Who's it for?

397
00:30:57.259 --> 00:30:59.099
Lieutenant Harris.

398
00:31:16.179 --> 00:31:18.618
Sir! Look, sir, new pants.

399
00:31:18.779 --> 00:31:20.659
What are you doing...? Give me that.

400
00:31:20.819 --> 00:31:24.739
All right, you scumbags, you have
30 minutes to shower and get to class.

401
00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.379
Let's go. Move it. Move it. Move it.

402
00:31:27.539 --> 00:31:29.618
Pick it up. Pick it up.

403
00:31:29.779 --> 00:31:32.539
Pick it up, assholes.

404
00:31:40.019 --> 00:31:42.658
So far, nobody's quit.

405
00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:43.858
But they will.

406
00:32:06.779 --> 00:32:09.059
Well, well, well.

407
00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.859
I told you not to try me, boy.

408
00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.418
Stand up.

409
00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.098
Now, I want you two squad leaders...

410
00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:23.258
to take Mr. Mahoney here
and run him until he throws up.

411
00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:24.419
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

412
00:32:24.579 --> 00:32:27.659
And then, just after he throws up...

413
00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.099
run him some more.

414
00:32:29.259 --> 00:32:30.898
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

415
00:32:33.379 --> 00:32:36.138
You are going to learn, Mahoney...

416
00:32:36.539 --> 00:32:38.458
that nobody...

417
00:32:39.539 --> 00:32:41.659
nobody...

418
00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.899
screws...

419
00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:46.138
with me.

420
00:32:46.819 --> 00:32:49.219
- Pick it up, pick it up! Come on!
- Hey, this is great.

421
00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:51.098
- Two assholes, no waiting.
- Move it!

422
00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:54.539
Chad, would you please just let me
yell at him without interrupting?

423
00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.938
- Sure.
- Come on, Mahoney! Move it, move it!

424
00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.099
Bang!

425
00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:00.058
Son, where did you get this gun?

426
00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.058
My mom gave it to me.

427
00:34:03.219 --> 00:34:05.899
Can I borrow it for a little while?

428
00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.858
Sure.

429
00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:14.618
Left, left right left.
Left, left, left right left.

430
00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:21.178
You will learn to defend yourselves
without stick or firearm.

431
00:34:22.259 --> 00:34:23.739
I need a volunteer.

432
00:34:23.899 --> 00:34:26.859
- Barbara, get out here.
- I just ate.

433
00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:30.979
Right where I'm standing.
Right here. Right now.

434
00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:36.179
All right, come at me
with an imaginary knife.

435
00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.498
Do I have to?

436
00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:41.019
Yes, you do. I'm not joking.

437
00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:43.818
Come on. Come on.

438
00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.658
Now!

439
00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:56.258
Okay. That's how it's done.
Who's next?

440
00:34:56.419 --> 00:34:58.458
- Pick me!
- I'd love it. I'd love to go.

441
00:34:58.619 --> 00:35:00.779
I'd love to go. We'll both go.

442
00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:03.099
You have 20 minutes
to complete the test.

443
00:35:03.259 --> 00:35:06.339
Try to answer as many questions
as possible.

444
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.778
All right, start.

445
00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:23.138
All right, here we go.
The count's at two. Here's the pitch.

446
00:35:23.579 --> 00:35:24.938
Swung on and missed!

447
00:35:26.619 --> 00:35:28.258
Struck out.

448
00:35:41.659 --> 00:35:45.498
Well, it was Saturday night
and I was feeling all right

449
00:35:45.659 --> 00:35:47.418
Looking for my buttercup

450
00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:52.139
They were dancing next door
on the thirteenth floor

451
00:36:28.179 --> 00:36:29.538
You know, Mahoney...

452
00:36:29.699 --> 00:36:33.979
I'd like to spend the next month
breaking you into little pieces.

453
00:36:34.899 --> 00:36:36.459
But I won't...

454
00:36:36.659 --> 00:36:38.618
because you're bad.

455
00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:41.178
You're bad for morale, Mahoney.

456
00:36:41.899 --> 00:36:44.778
You look like the sweet little boy
from next door.

457
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.059
But you don't fool me. Oh, no.

458
00:36:47.219 --> 00:36:50.459
No, you're the devil,
and you're rotten to the core.

459
00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:52.219
And you're ruining my chances...

460
00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:55.178
of training some men
who might make pretty good cops.

461
00:36:55.339 --> 00:36:56.858
I agree. I've been saying that.

462
00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.978
- You make me sick.
- Thank you, sir. I make everybody sick.

463
00:37:00.139 --> 00:37:03.739
We're going to pick up this telephone
and call your buddy Capt. Reed.

464
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:08.218
And you. You are going to help me
talk him out of this terrible mistake.

465
00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.138
Terrific. I'll do my part.

466
00:37:10.299 --> 00:37:12.338
You're damn right you will.

467
00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:23.379
This is the Academy.
I'd like to speak to a Capt. Reed.

468
00:37:24.259 --> 00:37:26.298
Reed!

469
00:37:29.779 --> 00:37:32.979
Captain Reed? Yes, sir.
How are you, sir?

470
00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:36.858
This is Lt. Harris, Lt. Thaddeus Harris
out at the Police Academy.

471
00:37:37.019 --> 00:37:39.778
I'm so sorry to disturb you, sir...

472
00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:43.738
but your friend Cadet Mahoney
would like to speak with you.

473
00:37:43.899 --> 00:37:46.699
Just one moment, please. Mahoney.

474
00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.618
- Mahoney!
- Oh, yeah.

475
00:37:50.299 --> 00:37:52.699
Hi, Captain Reed? Can I get out of here?

476
00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.499
No? Okay.

477
00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.378
I tried.

478
00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:01.339
Captain Reed, thank you so much.

479
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.179
Yes. Goodbye. Yes.

480
00:38:05.659 --> 00:38:07.699
I don't know
what you're trying to do.

481
00:38:07.859 --> 00:38:09.778
I don't know why you're here.

482
00:38:09.939 --> 00:38:12.619
But you'll never be a cop
as long as I live.

483
00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:14.499
- Don't want to be.
- Get your butt off my desk.

484
00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:16.498
And get out of here!

485
00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.899
Mahoney!

486
00:38:20.899 --> 00:38:22.658
I've already told you once.

487
00:38:22.819 --> 00:38:25.538
Nobody screws with me.

488
00:38:26.139 --> 00:38:28.858
Well, maybe you'll meet the right girl
and all that'll change.

489
00:38:29.019 --> 00:38:31.379
Get out of here now!

490
00:38:34.899 --> 00:38:37.539
Come on, Mahoney.
Harris said you had to do a hundred.

491
00:38:41.499 --> 00:38:42.739
Hey, Mahoney.

492
00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:45.819
Here's a pair of my old sweat socks.
I wore them all day.

493
00:38:45.979 --> 00:38:48.058
That should help you to get up.

494
00:38:56.699 --> 00:38:58.299
You did it.

495
00:38:59.299 --> 00:39:01.419
You son of a bitch.

496
00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:24.299
This is a hell of a way
to spend my evenings.

497
00:39:26.979 --> 00:39:28.819
I can't feel my arms anymore.

498
00:39:33.059 --> 00:39:34.978
Hey, Barbara, come here.

499
00:39:35.379 --> 00:39:36.578
- Me?
- Yeah, come here.

500
00:39:36.739 --> 00:39:39.019
- What?
- Come on, right here.

501
00:39:41.019 --> 00:39:43.019
- I want you to give me your best shot.
- What?

502
00:39:43.179 --> 00:39:44.578
I want you to hit me. Best shot.

503
00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.019
- Hit you?
- Yeah, come on.

504
00:39:46.179 --> 00:39:48.579
- No, really, I...
- Hit me.

505
00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:50.779
- Really, when I...
- Do it now. Come on.

506
00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:53.738
- I can't. Because when I...
- Do it. Give me your...

507
00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:56.498
How was that? Was that okay?

508
00:39:57.339 --> 00:39:58.779
Yeah.

509
00:39:58.939 --> 00:40:00.939
Yeah, that's good.

510
00:40:06.339 --> 00:40:10.498
This weekend is your first leave
from the Academy.

511
00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:15.499
When you go, wherever it is
you filthbags go...

512
00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:19.579
do take note of how nice things are
on the outside.

513
00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:23.938
Do give serious consideration
to not coming back.

514
00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:26.138
Four of you have already quit.

515
00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.138
And that's just the beginning.

516
00:40:29.819 --> 00:40:32.018
Ten-hut!

517
00:40:32.539 --> 00:40:33.538
Dismissed.

518
00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.859
Heard him, dismissed! Let's go.

519
00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:40.658
They'll get together for a party.
They always do.

520
00:40:40.819 --> 00:40:42.619
You go with them.

521
00:40:43.099 --> 00:40:46.859
Whenever they get out of line,
give me a ring.

522
00:40:52.579 --> 00:40:54.699
Hi, Leslie.

523
00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:57.979
Studying hard?

524
00:40:58.459 --> 00:40:59.458
Yup.

525
00:40:59.739 --> 00:41:02.058
Where's the party going to be
this weekend?

526
00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:03.578
Party?

527
00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:05.779
Party? I don't know anything
about a party.

528
00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:08.378
I'm going home for the weekend
and visit my mom and dad.

529
00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:11.699
Now, if you don't mind,
I do have to study.

530
00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:15.458
You know, Chad?
I don't think we've got his full attention.

531
00:41:15.619 --> 00:41:18.979
So why don't you take his books
and throw them out the window?

532
00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:21.818
My pleasure, Kyle.

533
00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:33.858
Find out where the party is.

534
00:41:34.019 --> 00:41:36.738
- How?
- Ask Mahoney.

535
00:41:36.899 --> 00:41:39.019
- Mahoney.
- Mahoney.

536
00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:42.579
1011, 1012, 1013...

537
00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:46.299
Mahoney.

538
00:41:46.459 --> 00:41:48.698
Could I speak to you outside
for just a second?

539
00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:50.298
Yeah.

540
00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:54.378
What's up?

541
00:41:55.139 --> 00:41:57.018
Mahoney...

542
00:41:58.539 --> 00:41:59.979
Is there a party this weekend?

543
00:42:00.339 --> 00:42:02.498
Yeah, of course there is.
Do you want to come?

544
00:42:02.659 --> 00:42:04.578
No. No, I can't...

545
00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:08.099
I just need to know where it is.
Sorry to be asking.

546
00:42:08.859 --> 00:42:10.099
Then why are you asking?

547
00:42:10.779 --> 00:42:13.179
Some people want to know.

548
00:42:13.339 --> 00:42:16.699
Okay, yeah. It's no big secret.
It's at the Blue Oyster bar.

549
00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:19.138
It's on Howell.

550
00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:40.339
Hey, big boy,
why don't you come up

551
00:42:40.499 --> 00:42:41.939
And see me sometime?

552
00:42:45.299 --> 00:42:47.179
Hey, big boy

553
00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:07.538
So, what about you, Hightower?
What are you doing at the Academy?

554
00:43:07.699 --> 00:43:09.779
I got bored with my chosen profession.

555
00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:12.458
- What was that?
- I was a florist.

556
00:43:12.619 --> 00:43:13.619
A florist?

557
00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:16.379
You know, flowers and shit.

558
00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:18.938
Oh, yeah.

559
00:44:09.099 --> 00:44:11.578
- Hi.
- Hi.

560
00:44:13.779 --> 00:44:17.419
- I didn't think you'd show up.
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.

561
00:44:28.699 --> 00:44:31.499
Do you want to go for a walk?

562
00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:33.019
- Walk.
- Oh, yeah.

563
00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:35.099
Are you kidding? Of course.

564
00:44:54.259 --> 00:44:56.339
- Can you tell me something?
- Yeah?

565
00:44:56.539 --> 00:44:58.699
Why do you want to be a cop?

566
00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:05.498
I like to dress like a man.

567
00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:08.618
Me too.

568
00:45:12.179 --> 00:45:17.099
Tonight you're mine completely

569
00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:24.378
You give your love so sweetly

570
00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:31.459
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes

571
00:45:32.379 --> 00:45:37.978
But will you love me tomorrow?

572
00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:44.499
Is this a lasting treasure

573
00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:51.619
Or just a moment's pleasure?

574
00:46:02.099 --> 00:46:06.699
Okay, let's go. Move it. Move it.
Let's go.

575
00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:13.459
Two lines, right here.

576
00:46:13.619 --> 00:46:16.258
The first one on the step,
the second one off.

577
00:46:18.979 --> 00:46:22.298
I said two lines, dummy!
Now step it up, step it up, let's go.

578
00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:23.658
Hey.

579
00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.938
Why didn't you call me this weekend?

580
00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:32.418
Well, nothing really happened, sir.

581
00:46:32.579 --> 00:46:35.138
There was a party, wasn't there?

582
00:46:36.139 --> 00:46:37.579
Yes, sir.

583
00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:39.619
Well, what went on?

584
00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:43.579
Dancing, sir.

585
00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:45.139
Mostly dancing.

586
00:46:51.099 --> 00:46:52.298
Dancing?

587
00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:59.578
Hightower, you're first. Let's go.

588
00:47:09.459 --> 00:47:11.059
Come with me.

589
00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.459
Ready now, sir.

590
00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:44.659
Thank you.

591
00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:47.099
I got him.

592
00:47:53.619 --> 00:47:55.899
Tackleberry. You're next.

593
00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:11.738
Come with me.

594
00:48:18.179 --> 00:48:21.099
- Hey!
- Tackleberry!

595
00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:53.459
Holy shit.

596
00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.139
Get back here.

597
00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:06.978
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, ma'am.

598
00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:12.539
- Don't worry, I can explain everything.
- Shut up.

599
00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:16.058
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, ma'am.

600
00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:17.658
Yes, ma'am.

601
00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:21.739
You've been sneaking in here
every night for weeks.

602
00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:23.698
What? No.

603
00:49:23.859 --> 00:49:27.619
What do you think
I ought to do about this?

604
00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:30.339
Well, let's see...

605
00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:37.138
My God.

606
00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:41.818
Sir.

607
00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:44.538
Ma'am.

608
00:49:54.859 --> 00:49:58.938
A police officer must generate
respect and confidence.

609
00:49:59.099 --> 00:50:01.818
His or her voice, Hooks...

610
00:50:01.979 --> 00:50:05.538
has a great deal to do with that.
Hooks, get up. Stand right over here.

611
00:50:05.699 --> 00:50:07.699
Today, Hooks.

612
00:50:08.819 --> 00:50:12.658
Now, here is the house.

613
00:50:12.819 --> 00:50:14.858
Here is the window.

614
00:50:15.019 --> 00:50:17.819
And I am a burglar.

615
00:50:18.419 --> 00:50:21.178
I am coming out of the window...

616
00:50:21.339 --> 00:50:24.539
with a stolen stereo in my hand.

617
00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:27.898
I'm coming out of the window,
over the hedge...

618
00:50:28.059 --> 00:50:30.218
and you are the arresting officer.

619
00:50:30.379 --> 00:50:31.979
What do you say, Hooks?

620
00:50:32.539 --> 00:50:35.619
Don't move! This is a stickup.

621
00:50:37.339 --> 00:50:38.618
Stickup?

622
00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:42.099
I mean, police, police officer. Stop.

623
00:50:42.859 --> 00:50:45.379
Sit down, Hooks.

624
00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:46.978
Sit, sit, sit.

625
00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:52.418
Tackleberry, you try it. Same situation.

626
00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:55.939
All right. Here is the house.
Here is the window.

627
00:50:56.100 --> 00:51:00.059
I'm the burglar. I'm coming out
of the house, over the hedge...

628
00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:02.338
I've got the stolen stereo in my hands.

629
00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:06.499
Drop that stereo before I blow
your goddamn nuts off, asshole!

630
00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:14.219
Tackleberry, we really need to talk.

631
00:51:15.099 --> 00:51:17.538
Mahoney, let me ask you a question.

632
00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:21.538
Have you ever had a woman just...

633
00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:25.098
throw you down and screw
your goddamn brains out?

634
00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:26.539
No.

635
00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:29.019
It happened to me last night.

636
00:51:29.179 --> 00:51:32.179
Really? How was it?

637
00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:34.899
I think...

638
00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:38.299
I'm in love.

639
00:51:41.419 --> 00:51:43.259
- How many girls were there?
- Just one.

640
00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:44.899
Just one?

641
00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:48.579
You made love to just one girl?

642
00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:50.178
That's disgusting.

643
00:51:50.339 --> 00:51:51.978
Yeah, I know.

644
00:51:53.339 --> 00:51:56.979
- Hey, George, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

645
00:51:58.419 --> 00:52:00.819
Every now and then...

646
00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:03.419
you seem to lose your Spanish accent.

647
00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:05.418
What's up?

648
00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:08.379
Yeah. Every now and then.

649
00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:11.858
Can you keep a secret?

650
00:52:12.019 --> 00:52:13.338
Oh, yeah.

651
00:52:13.499 --> 00:52:16.098
I'm not really George Martin.

652
00:52:16.259 --> 00:52:20.859
I'm just plain old George Martin,
fourth-generation American.

653
00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:23.658
- Really?
- I just use the accent to get the girls.

654
00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:27.479
Does it work?

655
00:52:32.259 --> 00:52:35.259
- Barbara!
- He's in the gym.

656
00:52:35.419 --> 00:52:37.699
You're gonna pay for sending us
to the wrong party.

657
00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:40.538
- I'll tell him.
- Not just pushups, either, Leslie.

658
00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:44.218
We're gonna get your fat ass
thrown out of here. That's a promise!

659
00:52:44.379 --> 00:52:45.858
- How?
- How?

660
00:52:46.019 --> 00:52:47.098
You'll find out.

661
00:52:47.259 --> 00:52:49.739
Mahoney isn't the only one here
who can play tricks.

662
00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:52.018
Hey, hey. Take it easy.
These ain't track shoes.

663
00:52:52.179 --> 00:52:53.418
Yeah, I know. Just hurry up.

664
00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:57.098
I'm as anxious as you.
I'm not comfortable in these surroundings.

665
00:52:57.259 --> 00:52:59.138
- Yeah, well, come on up.
- Up here?

666
00:52:59.299 --> 00:53:01.859
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hey, listen, when do I get my money?

667
00:53:02.019 --> 00:53:03.899
When the job's over,
for crying out loud.

668
00:53:12.899 --> 00:53:16.738
That's good, Hightower.
Why don't you just sit down over there?

669
00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:23.418
All right, you scumballs,
30 minutes to room inspection.

670
00:53:23.579 --> 00:53:26.298
Move it. Move it. Move it.

671
00:53:27.419 --> 00:53:31.219
- Hi, honey.
- Hi...

672
00:53:35.219 --> 00:53:37.399
Got a light?

673
00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:42.938
I don't smoke. I have a friend
who smokes. I'll go get him.

674
00:53:45.819 --> 00:53:47.858
Mahoney, major problem.

675
00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:55.739
Well, my goodness.

676
00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:04.939
Would you please just calm down
and take it easy?

677
00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:10.738
I just like to do it in strange places,
that's all. Okay?

678
00:54:10.899 --> 00:54:12.299
Why the hell didn't you say so?

679
00:54:13.499 --> 00:54:17.139
You'll find this academy one of the most
comprehensive in the country.

680
00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:21.659
I could point out many,
many, many features to you...

681
00:54:23.099 --> 00:54:25.138
- Squeeze in here. Yeah.
- In here?

682
00:54:25.299 --> 00:54:27.259
- You want to do it in a podium?
- All my life.

683
00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:29.219
- Right. Where you going?
- I'll be back.

684
00:54:29.379 --> 00:54:33.139
I'm not the customer. The real customer
will be here any second now, okay?

685
00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:35.059
Oh, okay.

686
00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:37.299
Gentlemen, please follow me.

687
00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:39.899
We have a very, very fine...

688
00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:42.298
slide presentation for you.

689
00:54:43.419 --> 00:54:45.338
Please take your seats.

690
00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.618
I think you'll find
there's plenty of room for everybody.

691
00:54:49.579 --> 00:54:50.938
Thank you.

692
00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:57.938
First of all, I'd like to say
how sorry I am...

693
00:54:58.099 --> 00:55:00.258
that everybody could not make it today.

694
00:55:00.419 --> 00:55:04.699
For those here, I think you'll find
the presentation interesting...

695
00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:07.418
as well as very, very stimulating.

696
00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:18.778
Could we have the lights turned down?

697
00:55:20.019 --> 00:55:22.618
Now, this first slide...

698
00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:25.259
shows a very...

699
00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:27.499
very interesting thing.

700
00:55:28.379 --> 00:55:30.259
Our main building.

701
00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:34.779
In slide two...

702
00:55:37.179 --> 00:55:38.899
we see...

703
00:55:39.899 --> 00:55:41.499
another view...

704
00:55:41.659 --> 00:55:43.939
of it.

705
00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:47.738
Oh, my God. You wouldn't believe it.

706
00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:59.618
Let us look at this slide for a moment,
without comment.

707
00:55:59.779 --> 00:56:01.939
I think it speaks for itself.

708
00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:18.059
Could we have the lights, please?

709
00:56:22.139 --> 00:56:23.498
Well.

710
00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:28.219
I hope this was as much fun for you
as it was for me.

711
00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:32.538
Let's have lunch, shall we?

712
00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:36.938
And maybe, smoke a cigarette.

713
00:56:58.619 --> 00:57:00.299
Good speech.

714
00:57:29.499 --> 00:57:31.499
What do you intend to do
about Mahoney?

715
00:57:31.659 --> 00:57:33.499
- What's he done?
- What's he done?

716
00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:37.619
I'll tell you what he's done.
He...

717
00:57:41.139 --> 00:57:42.419
Yes, sir?

718
00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:44.698
He did a very, very bad thing.

719
00:57:45.779 --> 00:57:47.379
To whom, sir?

720
00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:49.378
To whom?

721
00:57:53.179 --> 00:57:54.619
Yes, sir.

722
00:57:55.659 --> 00:57:58.258
Well, I don't know.

723
00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:00.898
Are you all right, sir?

724
00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:03.979
No, not really. May I go?

725
00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:07.298
- Of course, sir.
- Thank you.

726
00:58:07.459 --> 00:58:09.139
You're welcome.

727
00:58:13.059 --> 00:58:16.218
Left, right, left. Left. Left.

728
00:58:25.139 --> 00:58:27.458
Left, right, left. Left.

729
00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:46.018
Left, right, left.
Left. Left. Left, right, left.

730
00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:50.579
From now on, part of your training
will be to ride, from time to time...

731
00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:54.019
in actual squad cars
with actual police officers...

732
00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:55.898
in actual situations.

733
00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:58.819
And you'd better actually
keep your mouths shut.

734
00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:01.338
And your eyes and your ears open.

735
00:59:01.499 --> 00:59:05.019
Say, Mahoney,
why don't you ride with me?

736
00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:11.819
Well, move it, cretins!
Move it, move it, move it!

737
00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:15.738
Lieutenant Harris, I've changed
my mind. I want to be a cop.

738
00:59:15.899 --> 00:59:18.739
- Never, punk.
- Why not? All I have to do is behave...

739
00:59:18.899 --> 00:59:20.858
Get out of this car, Mahoney.
You hear me?

740
00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:25.299
You get. Get, Mahoney.
You get out there and you follow me.

741
00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:27.899
You stay right behind me, punk.

742
00:59:34.299 --> 00:59:36.618
Oh, how I love a ride in the country.

743
00:59:46.059 --> 00:59:47.698
Officer. Officer.

744
00:59:47.859 --> 00:59:50.578
Can you get my kitty-cat out of the tree?

745
00:59:51.979 --> 00:59:54.219
No problem, ma'am.

746
00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:56.218
Oh, no. No, wait.

747
01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.579
What the hell is this?

748
01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:15.418
I'll be right back. I'm sorry.

749
01:00:24.059 --> 01:00:26.299
What the hell is going on down there?

750
01:00:26.779 --> 01:00:28.619
Move it!

751
01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:32.538
Assholes.

752
01:00:32.979 --> 01:00:35.059
Hey! Hey, you, give me that bike.

753
01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:39.339
Come on, move it. This is official
police business. Move it out. Let's go.

754
01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.819
- It's new.
- Don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt it.

755
01:00:59.699 --> 01:01:01.498
My God.

756
01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:03.899
Someone call a veterinarian.

757
01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:11.739
Your new hat, sir.

758
01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.099
You told no one?

759
01:01:27.259 --> 01:01:29.099
Not a soul.

760
01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:32.179
Hightower? Hightower?

761
01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:33.538
I need to talk.

762
01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:35.659
That's terrific, Hightower,
but it's...

763
01:02:36.099 --> 01:02:39.179
It's 2:30 in the morning.

764
01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:42.298
- The driving course is tomorrow.
- So?

765
01:02:42.459 --> 01:02:44.179
I haven't driven a car since I was 12.

766
01:02:44.339 --> 01:02:45.899
Really? You're kidding.

767
01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:50.619
If I don't pass this driving course,
they're gonna kick me out. Harris said so.

768
01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:55.699
All right. Let's go.

769
01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:59.138
Sleeping is for fags.

770
01:02:59.419 --> 01:03:03.258
First thing we gotta do is steal a car.
Copeland's should do.

771
01:03:07.419 --> 01:03:09.259
Okay, your turn.

772
01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:11.859
Now, you've got to remember
to drive defensively...

773
01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:16.379
or offensively, depending
on your needs. Let's go.

774
01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:25.778
Comfy?

775
01:03:26.299 --> 01:03:27.578
- No.
- All right.

776
01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:29.979
Let's just move the seat back a little.

777
01:03:30.139 --> 01:03:33.499
On second thought, let's rip
the front seats out and sit in the back.

778
01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:51.059
I was kidding about the front seat.
But this is good.

779
01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:53.458
It's different. Comfort's important.

780
01:03:57.019 --> 01:04:01.578
Put it into first. Right. Little more.
Okay, you can go a little faster now.

781
01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:07.738
Yeah. Yeah, you're doing beautifully.
You feel it? You feel what's going on?

782
01:04:07.899 --> 01:04:10.419
You can even
turn off the windshield wipers.

783
01:04:11.299 --> 01:04:13.179
Yeah, that's it.

784
01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:16.579
Okay, now there's another car.

785
01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:20.299
Hightower?

786
01:04:21.619 --> 01:04:24.979
Hightow...? What...?
You didn't hit the brakes.

787
01:04:25.139 --> 01:04:27.179
You didn't tell me to.

788
01:04:27.339 --> 01:04:28.858
You idiot!

789
01:04:29.019 --> 01:04:32.018
You bastard! You dumb shit!

790
01:04:42.979 --> 01:04:45.738
- Pull over and let me drive for a while.
- No, not now.

791
01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:47.459
This is fun.

792
01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:52.779
- Pull over.
- No, I'm getting out of here.

793
01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:21.339
Holy shit!

794
01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:45.778
Attaboy, Hightower.

795
01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:00.539
Taught him everything he knows.

796
01:06:11.059 --> 01:06:12.739
Not bad.

797
01:06:12.979 --> 01:06:14.499
Not bad.

798
01:06:14.899 --> 01:06:17.498
Miss Hooks, you're next.

799
01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:18.779
Hurry up!

800
01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:21.338
Thanks, Mahoney. You saved my life.

801
01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.979
- Maybe someday you'll save mine.
- Any time.

802
01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:26.219
You're next. Yellow line. Yellow line.

803
01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:29.018
You better not cry

804
01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:33.498
You better not pout,
I'm telling you why

805
01:06:53.979 --> 01:06:55.259
Oh, this is fun.

806
01:07:01.779 --> 01:07:03.578
What is it? What is it?

807
01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:05.618
She ran over my feet.

808
01:07:05.779 --> 01:07:08.058
I'm sorry. I really am.

809
01:07:08.219 --> 01:07:11.979
Sorry? You dumb, fat jigaboo!

810
01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:16.978
Oh, shit.

811
01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:23.418
Oh, shit.

812
01:07:23.579 --> 01:07:25.819
- At ease, Hightower. At ease.
- It's okay, Hightower.

813
01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:29.218
- He didn't mean it. He was joking.
- Take it easy, now. Hightower!

814
01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:30.818
Hightower, don't do that.

815
01:07:30.979 --> 01:07:35.898
If you don't stop, you are out of here.
I am warning you, Hightower!

816
01:07:45.659 --> 01:07:48.378
You messed up big, mister.

817
01:07:48.539 --> 01:07:52.699
Now you get your stuff
and get out of here, right now.

818
01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:54.899
Get!

819
01:07:58.139 --> 01:08:00.578
Attention, applications for
motorcycle service...

820
01:08:00.739 --> 01:08:03.939
should be turned in at
the Administration building by Friday.

821
01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:06.699
Applications for motorcycle service
should be turned in...

822
01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:09.739
One down, several to go.

823
01:08:16.819 --> 01:08:19.179
Copeland, get out of that car.

824
01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:29.499
Mahoney.

825
01:08:31.859 --> 01:08:33.619
It's got to be Mahoney.

826
01:08:35.419 --> 01:08:39.018
I know, I know. Come on.

827
01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:46.418
Out of all the people I thought would
make it, Hightower was the one.

828
01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:50.138
I mean, if all the cops looked like him,
there'd be no crime at all.

829
01:08:51.219 --> 01:08:52.858
I'm getting sick of this place.

830
01:08:53.019 --> 01:08:55.738
How're you doing, Ma-homo?

831
01:08:56.139 --> 01:08:57.818
Don't fool with me.
Not in the mood.

832
01:08:57.980 --> 01:08:59.418
You wrecked my car.

833
01:08:59.579 --> 01:09:03.099
No, Hightower did. Why don't you
go see him? That'd be a matchup.

834
01:09:03.259 --> 01:09:05.299
Because we want you.

835
01:09:05.899 --> 01:09:09.178
Okay, how about 12:00 midnight?
Nine o'clock on the coast.

836
01:09:09.339 --> 01:09:13.538
No, no. I'm talking right now, Mahoney.
Let's go. You throw the first punch.

837
01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:15.179
Cadet could get thrown out...

838
01:09:15.339 --> 01:09:17.739
- for hitting another cadet.
- Oh, really?

839
01:09:18.259 --> 01:09:20.818
I thought you wanted to get thrown out.

840
01:09:20.979 --> 01:09:22.778
Here's your chance.

841
01:09:24.939 --> 01:09:26.338
No.

842
01:09:27.699 --> 01:09:31.739
Now, Mahoney, I'm going to rub this
right in your face.

843
01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:33.419
On your mark...

844
01:09:33.579 --> 01:09:35.378
get set...

845
01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.579
- Wait, you guys! Wait!
- What the hell...?

846
01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:52.419
Who threw the first punch?

847
01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:54.899
- That's all I want to know.
- Barbara did.

848
01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:57.619
- Barbara?
- That's right, sir.

849
01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:01.538
Then he's out of here.
Him and his queer dog.

850
01:10:01.699 --> 01:10:04.858
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Barbara didn't throw the first punch.

851
01:10:05.019 --> 01:10:06.459
- He did so.
- I threw the punch.

852
01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:08.739
Mahoney, you're out
of your mind. Lieutenant...

853
01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:12.818
- Blankes, who'd you rather have out?
- Is that true, Blankes?

854
01:10:14.459 --> 01:10:16.739
Did Mahoney start it?

855
01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:21.978
Yes, sir. Mahoney started it.

856
01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:26.818
Then, Mahoney, my little piss-ant...

857
01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:30.498
you are out of the Academy...

858
01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:32.538
forever.

859
01:10:34.339 --> 01:10:36.098
Get your stuff.

860
01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:38.539
And get out.

861
01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:41.178
Too bad, so sad, bye-bye.

862
01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:57.339
Does the radio bother you?

863
01:11:00.379 --> 01:11:02.338
I could turn it down.

864
01:11:09.339 --> 01:11:11.339
Here, I brought you an apple.

865
01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:14.179
Thanks.

866
01:11:19.739 --> 01:11:21.299
Hey, man, what...?

867
01:11:41.299 --> 01:11:43.898
My God. Here, take this.

868
01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:46.539
Hey, free TV's.

869
01:11:51.539 --> 01:11:54.418
Hey, everybody! There's a riot going on.

870
01:11:59.779 --> 01:12:02.538
My livelihood! You're ruining me!

871
01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:05.499
What do you got there?
What are you doing with that TV?

872
01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:14.738
- Hi. Want a ride?
- No, thanks.

873
01:12:28.859 --> 01:12:30.338
Hey, did you two hear the news...

874
01:12:30.499 --> 01:12:31.939
- on the radio?
- No.

875
01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:34.939
- A riot's broken out downtown.
- How come?

876
01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:36.818
Who knows how these things
get started?

877
01:12:36.979 --> 01:12:39.138
Attention! All cadets report immediately...

878
01:12:39.299 --> 01:12:40.859
to the parking lot in full riot gear.

879
01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:44.859
Repeat, all cadets report immediately
to the parking lot in full riot gear.

880
01:12:45.019 --> 01:12:46.138
This is not a drill.

881
01:12:46.299 --> 01:12:49.018
- Jones! Was that you?
- No, man.

882
01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:52.619
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

883
01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:57.299
Get out there fast!
Move it, move it, move it!

884
01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:59.379
Let's go, let's go.

885
01:13:12.459 --> 01:13:16.099
This is it. This is the big one.

886
01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:18.498
It's time this cop...

887
01:13:18.659 --> 01:13:20.739
met the public.

888
01:13:26.299 --> 01:13:29.819
All right, listen up.
Here's the situation. There is a state...

889
01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:33.058
of general disorder
in the Oakfield section of town.

890
01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:35.258
Real police are handling the problem.

891
01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:38.459
We are being sent
to a peripheral safe area.

892
01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:42.299
Our job will be merely to divert traffic
away from the trouble zone...

893
01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.659
and to protect public property.

894
01:13:44.819 --> 01:13:46.379
You will have live ammunition...

895
01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:48.378
but there will be no call to use it.

896
01:13:48.539 --> 01:13:52.218
Tackleberry, do you understand,
numb nuts?

897
01:13:52.379 --> 01:13:53.858
Yes, sir.

898
01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:03.098
Come on!

899
01:14:07.579 --> 01:14:10.099
We are now entering
the expressway at Belmont.

900
01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:13.498
Very good. Your bus is to deploy
on Sixteenth Street...

901
01:14:13.659 --> 01:14:15.538
between 4th and 8th Avenues.

902
01:14:15.699 --> 01:14:17.939
Sixteenth Street? Are you sure, sir?

903
01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:20.459
Of course I'm sure.
I never forget a number.

904
01:14:21.739 --> 01:14:22.978
Yes, sir.

905
01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:24.979
There's nobody around.

906
01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:28.379
I guess they're hiding.

907
01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:43.219
All right, let's go, dirtbags, unload it.
Let's move it.

908
01:14:43.379 --> 01:14:46.018
I want two lines right here.
Come on, dummies.

909
01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:49.418
Let's go, let's go.

910
01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:55.099
You, one block over, one block up.

911
01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:57.378
You, one block down.

912
01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:01.699
You, one block up. You, one block over.

913
01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:05.979
You, one block over. Let's go. Let's go.

914
01:15:06.139 --> 01:15:08.259
If you have to make an arrest...

915
01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:10.938
do it as quietly as possible.

916
01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:15.738
Boy, it sure is quiet around here, huh?

917
01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:33.018
Hey, Fackler. How's it going?

918
01:15:33.179 --> 01:15:34.978
Oh, just fine, thanks.

919
01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:40.698
- What the hell are you doing here?
- We're from the Academy.

920
01:15:40.859 --> 01:15:44.619
You're supposed to be blocks away.
The damn riot's right down this street.

921
01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:46.579
We're pulling out.

922
01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:52.619
I love sushi. I'm into back-rubs,
all kinds of Japanese stuff.

923
01:15:52.779 --> 01:15:54.939
My car stereo, it's a Sony.

924
01:15:55.099 --> 01:15:58.219
I got a good friend, his father was killed
at Pearl Harbor.

925
01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:01.978
Hey, maybe your family had
something to do with it?

926
01:16:02.139 --> 01:16:03.898
You know sake? The wine?

927
01:16:04.059 --> 01:16:07.779
I know a place where they heat it up
before they serve it.

928
01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:10.218
Holy shit.

929
01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:12.538
I got to go now.

930
01:16:20.739 --> 01:16:22.418
Run!

931
01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:53.619
Hello, men. I thought I'd come by
for a personal inspection.

932
01:16:54.619 --> 01:16:56.619
- Okay if we get in, sir?
- I guess so.

933
01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:59.738
Sure, why not?
Well, men, how's it going?

934
01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:02.699
I want you to give me a fix
on the entire situation.

935
01:17:02.859 --> 01:17:04.419
Not that good, sir.

936
01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:08.299
Oh, so this is very, very, very bad.

937
01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:11.419
The main thing is not to panic.

938
01:17:16.859 --> 01:17:19.139
Attention! Attention, everybody.

939
01:17:19.299 --> 01:17:24.219
Attention. This is Commandant
Eric Lassard of the Police Academy.

940
01:17:24.379 --> 01:17:27.459
If you do not disperse immediately,
my men will have to arrest you.

941
01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:33.338
You have five seconds to move away.
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

942
01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:37.659
Give me the thing.

943
01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.419
You should park cars for a living, sir.

944
01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:22.859
Anybody want any of this?

945
01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:24.618
You want this? You'd die for this.

946
01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:26.699
- You're not so tough now.
- Come and take it.

947
01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:29.099
- How about you? You want this?
- What's the matter?

948
01:18:29.259 --> 01:18:33.299
- I'm talking to you, twerp.
- Just too dumb to talk, huh?

949
01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:02.738
Damn it. Look, in here.

950
01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:06.659
Try this one.

951
01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:18.019
Help. Help.
This is Cadet Leslie Barbara. Help.

952
01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:21.098
Barbara, this is Lt. Harris.

953
01:19:21.259 --> 01:19:22.458
Just calm down.

954
01:19:23.419 --> 01:19:25.699
I'm being chased by 30 rioters.

955
01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:29.178
Barbara, just tell me where you are.

956
01:19:29.339 --> 01:19:31.378
I'm passing you now, sir.

957
01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:37.899
Holy shit.

958
01:19:43.899 --> 01:19:45.019
Hi.

959
01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:51.698
Get the cops!

960
01:20:12.379 --> 01:20:15.018
Okay. Hold it right there, guys.

961
01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:17.019
Why, if it isn't Leslie Barbara...

962
01:20:17.179 --> 01:20:19.579
- The police officer.
- Yeah.

963
01:20:20.339 --> 01:20:22.499
Come on, Les,
you're not going to shoot us.

964
01:20:22.659 --> 01:20:25.619
You wouldn't shoot old friends,
would you?

965
01:20:30.939 --> 01:20:32.459
No.

966
01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:34.778
Les.

967
01:20:35.739 --> 01:20:37.898
Get lost. We're busy.

968
01:20:54.779 --> 01:20:59.379
Now, get the furniture back up there
and get out of the area.

969
01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:02.018
But it's our furniture.

970
01:21:05.739 --> 01:21:06.978
Sorry.

971
01:21:18.619 --> 01:21:21.299
Callahan calling Harris.
Come in, please.

972
01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:22.979
Harris, come in.

973
01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:27.179
Where the hell is Harris?

974
01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:29.338
- I don't know.
- What?

975
01:21:29.499 --> 01:21:31.499
- She doesn't know.
- I heard her.

976
01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:35.938
Run!

977
01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:46.819
Why don't you shoot back?

978
01:21:51.419 --> 01:21:53.419
- Are those gunshots?
- Fucking A.

979
01:21:55.539 --> 01:21:58.018
Shoot back. Come on.

980
01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:02.419
Look up there. See? See?

981
01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:04.819
That looks like Harris up there.

982
01:22:04.979 --> 01:22:06.739
Should we shoot back?

983
01:22:13.339 --> 01:22:14.978
I don't think so.

984
01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:20.098
Come on!

985
01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:24.019
Stay there.

986
01:22:25.179 --> 01:22:26.579
Mahoney!

987
01:22:27.099 --> 01:22:29.378
Oh, shit. Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.

988
01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:33.538
I'll bet there's a back door to this place.

989
01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:36.779
Hooks. Hooks!
Hooks, get the hell back here.

990
01:22:36.939 --> 01:22:38.738
That's an order.

991
01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:31.739
Freeze!

992
01:23:33.059 --> 01:23:34.938
Oh, shit.

993
01:24:00.859 --> 01:24:02.459
Don't move, you bastard.

994
01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:05.619
Run, Thompson! Run!

995
01:24:07.619 --> 01:24:08.619
Put the gun down.

996
01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:11.978
Let's say you put your gun down.

997
01:24:15.259 --> 01:24:19.019
Lieutenant Harris, any last-minute
tips or suggestions?

998
01:24:21.299 --> 01:24:22.978
Nothing really comes to mind.

999
01:24:25.459 --> 01:24:26.979
What's it gonna be?

1000
01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:32.858
Throw your gun over the ledge.

1001
01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:36.779
I got two piglet-wigglets.

1002
01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:40.699
Hey!

1003
01:24:41.179 --> 01:24:42.458
What do you want?

1004
01:24:43.379 --> 01:24:45.578
I want to watch you off these pigs.

1005
01:24:51.499 --> 01:24:53.978
Sure. Sure.

1006
01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:03.179
Which one do we do first?

1007
01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:13.219
I believe I'd shoot this one.

1008
01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:14.579
Yeah, the old one.

1009
01:25:23.419 --> 01:25:27.859
- Looks like cadet revolvers to me.
- I know those guys.

1010
01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:34.658
Don't move, dirtbag!

1011
01:25:59.899 --> 01:26:02.019
Hey. Hey, hey.

1012
01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:04.178
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What's wrong with this man?

1013
01:26:04.339 --> 01:26:06.898
There was gunplay, sir, and he missed it.

1014
01:26:17.619 --> 01:26:21.058
- Lieutenant Harris? Captain Reed.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

1015
01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:24.218
Thank you. I also want to thank you
for looking out for Mahoney.

1016
01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:26.699
It was an honor and a pleasure, sir.

1017
01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:28.819
Thank you, sir.

1018
01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:37.338
- Could you just...?
- This woman bothering you?

1019
01:26:37.499 --> 01:26:40.419
What? No. This is my mother.

1020
01:26:41.619 --> 01:26:43.859
Ten-four. Carry on.

1021
01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:45.738
- Oh, my precious...
- Mom, would...?

1022
01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:48.178
- Then at 8:00 you'll meet my mother.
- Right.

1023
01:26:48.339 --> 01:26:50.778
- You'd better have some flowers.
- Flowers, check.

1024
01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:55.979
You men, stop that.

1025
01:27:00.139 --> 01:27:02.018
Oh, well.

1026
01:27:02.179 --> 01:27:03.779
That's more like it, Mahoney.

1027
01:27:04.539 --> 01:27:06.818
Good man. Keep up the good work.

1028
01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:08.859
Thank you, sir.

1029
01:27:09.019 --> 01:27:13.059
Ladies and gentlemen, the commandant
of the Academy, Eric Lassard.

1030
01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:22.819
So many unusual events have happened
to this graduating class...

1031
01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:24.619
and to me also.

1032
01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:28.098
I could tell you many, many stories,
but instead...

1033
01:27:28.259 --> 01:27:30.379
I have a presentation to make.

1034
01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:33.939
No Academy cadet has ever received
the highest award...

1035
01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:35.979
this police department has to make.

1036
01:27:36.459 --> 01:27:38.498
Today, there are two.

1037
01:27:38.659 --> 01:27:41.899
Officers Moses Hightower...

1038
01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:44.619
and Carey Mahoney.

1039
01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:46.939
Gentlemen, please step forward.

1040
01:28:21.059 --> 01:28:23.378
You are both expected
to make a few short remarks.

1041
01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:28.858
Officer Hightower.

1042
