1
00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:18.927
- Good morning, Miss Ratched.
- Good morning.

2
00:02:18.927 --> 00:02:21.930
- Good morning, Miss Ratched.
- Mr. Washington.

3
00:02:28.937 --> 00:02:31.940
- Good morning, Miss Ratched.
- Good morning.

4
00:02:32.607 --> 00:02:35.401
- Good morning, Bancini.
- Good morning.

5
00:02:43.243 --> 00:02:45.245
How are you feeling?

6
00:02:45.828 --> 00:02:47.247
Rested.

7
00:03:03.346 --> 00:03:05.139
Medication time.

8
00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.642
Medication time.

9
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.544
Okay, move it up!

10
00:03:35.837 --> 00:03:37.839
Mr. Fredrickson, here.

11
00:03:53.354 --> 00:03:54.772
Juice.

12
00:03:59.652 --> 00:04:01.070
Chief.

13
00:04:09.245 --> 00:04:10.538
Chief.

14
00:04:10.455 --> 00:04:12.665
Okay, my friend, let's go.

15
00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.524
Here are his papers,
and I'm gonna need a signature.

16
00:05:34.956 --> 00:05:36.249
Hi.

17
00:05:40.545 --> 00:05:43.047
- Mr. McMurphy's here.
- All right.

18
00:05:59.355 --> 00:06:00.648
All right, I'm ready.

19
00:06:00.565 --> 00:06:02.650
Okay. One pair of socks.

20
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.071
T-shirt.

21
00:06:12.452 --> 00:06:13.745
Hi.

22
00:06:18.166 --> 00:06:20.668
Goddamn, boy,
you're as big as a mountain!

23
00:06:20.668 --> 00:06:23.171
Looks like you might have played
some football.

24
00:06:23.171 --> 00:06:24.964
What's your name?

25
00:06:24.964 --> 00:06:27.258
He can't hear you. He's deaf.

26
00:06:27.467 --> 00:06:29.469
Deaf and dumb Indian.

27
00:06:31.846 --> 00:06:33.431
Is that so?

28
00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:35.642
Come on, Bibbit.

29
00:06:35.683 --> 00:06:37.977
Can't even make a sound, huh?

30
00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:41.272
How.

31
00:06:51.866 --> 00:06:54.077
Club lead. Jack of clubs.

32
00:06:58.164 --> 00:07:00.083
What's your name, son?

33
00:07:00.083 --> 00:07:01.793
Billy Bibbit.

34
00:07:01.876 --> 00:07:04.671
Glad to know you, Bill. McMurphy's mine.

35
00:07:05.672 --> 00:07:08.258
That's old Charlie Cheswick's cards.

36
00:07:09.384 --> 00:07:11.594
That's his ace of spades.

37
00:07:11.886 --> 00:07:13.680
Your turn, Bill.

38
00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:15.890
Big ten.

39
00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:20.770
- Put one of them on it, will you?
- Wait a minute.

40
00:07:25.066 --> 00:07:26.359
Oh, I can win that one.

41
00:07:26.276 --> 00:07:28.194
- I win.
- Oh, you overtrumped?

42
00:07:28.194 --> 00:07:30.280
- Sure.
- Pinochle, Bill?

43
00:07:33.783 --> 00:07:35.577
What's the bid?

44
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.662
Five... Five-fifty.

45
00:07:43.168 --> 00:07:46.254
You like to look at other people's cards,
do you?

46
00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:47.672
Yes.

47
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:49.507
Ever seen this one?

48
00:07:57.599 --> 00:07:59.893
- Come on, Martini.
- Martini!

49
00:08:00.685 --> 00:08:03.479
Martini, will you? Will you play a club?

50
00:08:08.193 --> 00:08:10.111
Whose turn is it now?

51
00:08:10.069 --> 00:08:11.362
Let's see, he trumped...

52
00:08:11.362 --> 00:08:12.655
Where you going?

53
00:08:12.572 --> 00:08:14.490
- Aren't you going to play?
- What's the matter?

54
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.910
Aren't you gonna play, Martini?

55
00:08:17.577 --> 00:08:19.662
Martini? I want to play.

56
00:08:22.582 --> 00:08:24.876
Billy, I want to win some...

57
00:08:25.793 --> 00:08:28.296
Get a grip on yourself, will you?

58
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:31.508
Get a grip on yourself, will you?

59
00:08:31.466 --> 00:08:32.759
Yes?

60
00:08:33.301 --> 00:08:36.596
- Mr. McMurphy's here, Doc.
- Good, have him come in.

61
00:08:40.892 --> 00:08:42.393
Thank you.

62
00:08:43.394 --> 00:08:44.687
McMurphy, I'm Dr. Spivey.

63
00:08:44.604 --> 00:08:47.106
Dr. Spivey, what a pleasure it is
to meet you.

64
00:08:47.106 --> 00:08:49.025
Sure. Pull up a chair,
sit down and let's talk.

65
00:08:48.983 --> 00:08:50.276
Sure.

66
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.580
R.P. McMurphy.

67
00:09:02.705 --> 00:09:05.208
That's a hell of a fish there, Doc.

68
00:09:05.208 --> 00:09:07.126
- Isn't that a dandy?
- Yeah.

69
00:09:07.085 --> 00:09:09.504
It's about 40 pounds, ain't it?

70
00:09:09.587 --> 00:09:11.506
- No, 32.
- Thirty-two.

71
00:09:11.506 --> 00:09:14.008
But I'll tell you,
it took every bit of strength I had...

72
00:09:14.008 --> 00:09:15.927
...to hold it while the guy took the picture.

73
00:09:15.885 --> 00:09:17.178
Every damn bit.

74
00:09:17.095 --> 00:09:20.181
Probably that chain
didn't help it any, either.

75
00:09:20.306 --> 00:09:22.225
You didn't weigh the chain, did you?

76
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.018
No, I didn't weigh the chain.

77
00:09:23.977 --> 00:09:25.895
But I'm awfully proud of that picture.

78
00:09:25.895 --> 00:09:28.690
That's the first Chinooker I ever caught.

79
00:09:29.607 --> 00:09:31.401
It's a nice one.

80
00:09:37.782 --> 00:09:39.993
Randall Patrick McMurphy.

81
00:09:40.285 --> 00:09:42.370
Thirty-eight years old.

82
00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:53.173
What can you tell me about...

83
00:09:53.381 --> 00:09:55.884
...why you've been sent over here?

84
00:09:57.218 --> 00:09:58.720
Well...

85
00:09:59.012 --> 00:10:00.722
I don't know.

86
00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:02.891
What's it say there?

87
00:10:03.391 --> 00:10:06.186
- Mind if I smoke?
- No, go right ahead.

88
00:10:07.187 --> 00:10:08.771
Well, it...

89
00:10:09.689 --> 00:10:11.983
...says several things here.

90
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.613
It said you've been belligerent.

91
00:10:17.197 --> 00:10:19.407
Talked when unauthorized.

92
00:10:20.283 --> 00:10:24.704
You've been resentful in attitude
towards work, in general. That you're lazy.

93
00:10:25.914 --> 00:10:27.916
Chewing gum in class.

94
00:10:32.212 --> 00:10:34.130
The real reason
that you've been sent here...

95
00:10:34.088 --> 00:10:37.175
...is because they wanted you
to be evaluated.

96
00:10:37.217 --> 00:10:40.303
To determine whether or not
you're mentally ill.

97
00:10:40.303 --> 00:10:42.388
This is the real reason.

98
00:10:42.805 --> 00:10:45.600
Why do you think they might think that?

99
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.814
Well, as near as I can figure out,
it's 'cause l...

100
00:10:52.815 --> 00:10:55.109
...fight and fuck too much.

101
00:10:55.318 --> 00:10:56.611
In the penitentiary?

102
00:10:56.611 --> 00:10:58.530
No, no, no, you mean why...

103
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.032
Why did you get sent over here...

104
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.992
...from the work farm?

105
00:11:05.328 --> 00:11:07.747
Well, I really don't know, Doc.

106
00:11:09.123 --> 00:11:11.042
It says here that you went around...

107
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.503
- Let me just take a look...
- It ain't up to me, you know.

108
00:11:13.503 --> 00:11:14.921
One...

109
00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:17.215
...two, three...

110
00:11:17.924 --> 00:11:19.509
...four...

111
00:11:19.717 --> 00:11:21.636
You've got at least...

112
00:11:21.594 --> 00:11:23.888
...five arrests for assault.

113
00:11:25.431 --> 00:11:27.934
What can you tell me about that?

114
00:11:27.934 --> 00:11:29.727
Five fights, huh?

115
00:11:29.727 --> 00:11:32.939
Rocky Marciano's got 40,
and he's a millionaire.

116
00:11:33.523 --> 00:11:35.817
- That's true.
- That is true.

117
00:11:37.902 --> 00:11:40.405
Of course, it's true that you went in for...

118
00:11:40.405 --> 00:11:41.698
...statutory rape.

119
00:11:41.614 --> 00:11:43.533
That's true, is it not, this time?

120
00:11:43.533 --> 00:11:45.827
Absolutely true. But, Doc...

121
00:11:47.328 --> 00:11:50.331
...she was 15 years old going on 35, Doc...

122
00:11:50.415 --> 00:11:53.501
...and she told me she was 18,
and she was...

123
00:11:54.127 --> 00:11:56.629
...very willing, you know what I mean?

124
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:59.924
I practically had to take
to sewing my pants shut.

125
00:12:00.425 --> 00:12:02.635
But between you and me...

126
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.516
...she might have been 15.
When you get that little red beaver...

127
00:12:08.516 --> 00:12:11.603
...right there in front of you,
I don't think it's crazy at all.

128
00:12:11.728 --> 00:12:13.021
And I don't think you do, either.

129
00:12:12.937 --> 00:12:14.856
I hear what you're saying.

130
00:12:14.814 --> 00:12:19.027
No man alive could resist that.
That's why I got into jail to begin with.

131
00:12:19.235 --> 00:12:21.154
Now they're telling me
I'm crazy over here...

132
00:12:21.029 --> 00:12:24.115
...'cause I don't sit there
like a goddamn vegetable.

133
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.159
It don't make a bit of sense to me.

134
00:12:26.034 --> 00:12:28.536
If that's what being crazy is...

135
00:12:28.536 --> 00:12:32.248
...then I'm senseless, out of it,
gone down the road, whacko.

136
00:12:32.332 --> 00:12:34.834
But, no more, no less. That's it.

137
00:12:36.127 --> 00:12:38.630
To be honest with you, McMurphy...

138
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:40.715
...what it says here...

139
00:12:42.926 --> 00:12:44.636
...is that...

140
00:12:45.428 --> 00:12:47.222
...they think...

141
00:12:47.347 --> 00:12:49.057
They think...

142
00:12:49.224 --> 00:12:53.144
...you've been faking it
in order to get out of your work detail.

143
00:12:54.812 --> 00:12:58.900
- What do you think about that?
- Do I look like that kind of guy to you?

144
00:13:01.736 --> 00:13:05.740
Let's just be frank for a minute.
All right, Randall, if you would.

145
00:13:06.741 --> 00:13:08.034
Tell me...

146
00:13:08.034 --> 00:13:11.621
Do you think there's anything
wrong with your mind, really?

147
00:13:13.039 --> 00:13:14.833
Not a thing, Doc.

148
00:13:14.833 --> 00:13:17.627
I'm a goddamn marvel of modern science.

149
00:13:23.049 --> 00:13:26.761
You're going to be here for a period,
for us to evaluate you.

150
00:13:26.719 --> 00:13:28.930
We're going to study you.

151
00:13:29.222 --> 00:13:32.934
We'll make our determinations
as to what we're going to do...

152
00:13:33.643 --> 00:13:36.729
...and give you the necessary treatment
as indicated.

153
00:13:36.729 --> 00:13:39.148
Doc, let me just tell you this.

154
00:13:39.232 --> 00:13:42.443
I'm here to cooperate with you
a hundred percent.

155
00:13:43.027 --> 00:13:44.320
A hundred percent.

156
00:13:44.237 --> 00:13:47.323
I'll be just right down the line with you.
You watch.

157
00:13:47.448 --> 00:13:50.743
'Cause I think we ought to get
to the bottom of...

158
00:13:51.119 --> 00:13:52.912
...R.P. McMurphy.

159
00:13:54.455 --> 00:13:56.249
...R.P. McMurphy.

160
00:14:07.552 --> 00:14:09.137
The scythe.

161
00:14:14.434 --> 00:14:16.352
I'm awfully tired.

162
00:14:16.352 --> 00:14:16.936
Sit down.

163
00:14:16.936 --> 00:14:18.438
I'm tired.

164
00:14:22.525 --> 00:14:24.319
Is that better?

165
00:14:34.454 --> 00:14:36.247
Mr. Ellsworth...

166
00:14:36.956 --> 00:14:39.250
...you'll wear yourself out.

167
00:14:43.254 --> 00:14:45.757
All right, gentlemen, let's begin.

168
00:14:48.259 --> 00:14:50.178
At the close of Friday's meeting...

169
00:14:50.053 --> 00:14:53.848
...we were discussing
Mr. Harding's problem concerning his wife.

170
00:14:55.058 --> 00:14:58.353
Mr. Harding stated that his wife
made him uneasy...

171
00:14:58.853 --> 00:15:02.148
...because she drew stares
from men on the street.

172
00:15:02.565 --> 00:15:04.484
Is that correct, Mr. Harding?

173
00:15:04.442 --> 00:15:05.735
Yes.

174
00:15:06.361 --> 00:15:08.154
That's correct.

175
00:15:10.156 --> 00:15:12.659
He also thinks he may have
given her reason...

176
00:15:12.659 --> 00:15:16.663
...to seek sexual attention elsewhere,
but he wasn't able to say how.

177
00:15:19.457 --> 00:15:22.544
Mr. Harding has been heard
to say to his wife:

178
00:15:22.669 --> 00:15:23.962
"I hate you".

179
00:15:23.837 --> 00:15:26.339
"I don't ever want to see you again".

180
00:15:26.339 --> 00:15:28.424
"You've betrayed me".

181
00:15:30.134 --> 00:15:33.221
So, does anyone care
to touch on this further?

182
00:15:50.154 --> 00:15:52.740
Mr. Scanlon, would you begin today?

183
00:15:56.369 --> 00:15:58.079
Are you sure?

184
00:16:03.877 --> 00:16:05.879
Billy, how about you?

185
00:16:08.256 --> 00:16:09.966
No, no, ma'am.

186
00:16:10.175 --> 00:16:13.678
I'd like to write in my book
that you began the meeting.

187
00:16:15.763 --> 00:16:17.265
Just once.

188
00:16:30.778 --> 00:16:32.363
Mr. Martini?

189
00:16:34.574 --> 00:16:36.367
Are you with us?

190
00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:38.953
Yes.

191
00:16:40.163 --> 00:16:42.248
Would you like to begin?

192
00:16:52.675 --> 00:16:54.385
Mr. Cheswick?

193
00:17:03.978 --> 00:17:05.563
- Me?
- Yes.

194
00:17:11.486 --> 00:17:15.406
You mean there's not a man here
who has an opinion on this matter?

195
00:17:20.286 --> 00:17:21.788
All right.

196
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:24.499
Mr. Harding...

197
00:17:24.582 --> 00:17:26.501
...you've stated on more than
one occasion...

198
00:17:26.459 --> 00:17:29.546
...that you've suspected your wife
of seeing other men.

199
00:17:29.587 --> 00:17:30.880
Oh, yes!

200
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.299
Yes, very much, I suspect her.

201
00:17:33.383 --> 00:17:35.093
I suspect her.

202
00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.178
Maybe you can tell us why...

203
00:17:37.178 --> 00:17:39.097
...you suspect her.

204
00:17:43.977 --> 00:17:45.895
Well, I can only...

205
00:17:45.895 --> 00:17:48.481
...speculate as to the reasons why.

206
00:17:50.275 --> 00:17:53.069
Have you ever speculated, Mr. Harding...

207
00:17:53.361 --> 00:17:55.572
...that perhaps you are...

208
00:17:55.864 --> 00:17:57.782
...impatient with your wife...

209
00:17:57.782 --> 00:18:01.202
...because she doesn't meet
your mental requirements?

210
00:18:03.371 --> 00:18:06.666
Perhaps. But you see,
the only thing I can really...

211
00:18:07.167 --> 00:18:09.085
...speculate on, Nurse Ratched...

212
00:18:09.085 --> 00:18:11.796
...is the very existence of my life...

213
00:18:12.172 --> 00:18:14.465
...with or without my wife...

214
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.095
...in terms of the human relationships,
the juxtaposition of...

215
00:18:20.263 --> 00:18:23.349
...one person to another,
the form, the content.

216
00:18:23.391 --> 00:18:27.187
Harding, why don't you knock off
the bullshit and get to the point?

217
00:18:27.187 --> 00:18:28.479
This is the point.

218
00:18:28.396 --> 00:18:31.399
This is the point, Taber. It's not bullshit.

219
00:18:31.566 --> 00:18:34.652
I'm not just talking about my wife,
I'm talking about my life!

220
00:18:34.694 --> 00:18:37.197
I can't seem to get that through to you.

221
00:18:37.197 --> 00:18:40.283
I'm not just talking about one person,
I'm talking about everybody!

222
00:18:40.283 --> 00:18:43.369
I'm talking about form !
I'm talking about content!

223
00:18:43.495 --> 00:18:44.787
I'm talking about interrelationships!

224
00:18:44.704 --> 00:18:47.790
I'm talking about God, the Devil,
Hell, Heaven!

225
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.084
Do you understand? Finally?

226
00:18:51.002 --> 00:18:54.506
Yeah, Harding, you're so fucking dumb
I can't believe it.

227
00:18:55.298 --> 00:18:57.800
It makes me feel very peculiar,
very peculiar...

228
00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.303
- ...when you throw in something like that.
- Why?

229
00:19:00.303 --> 00:19:02.222
What does that mean, "peculiar," Harding?

230
00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.182
- Peculiar?
- Peculiar?

231
00:19:06.601 --> 00:19:08.520
I'm gonna tell you guys something.

232
00:19:08.478 --> 00:19:10.396
You just don't want to learn anything.

233
00:19:10.396 --> 00:19:12.315
You just don't want to listen to anybody.

234
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:14.108
He's got intelligence!

235
00:19:14.108 --> 00:19:18.404
You've never heard the word "peculiar"?
Say, what are you trying to say?

236
00:19:18.488 --> 00:19:20.406
You trying to say I'm queer? Is that it?

237
00:19:20.406 --> 00:19:23.117
Little Mary Ann? Little Marjorie Jane?

238
00:19:23.493 --> 00:19:25.411
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

239
00:19:25.411 --> 00:19:27.914
Is that your idea of communicating
something to me?

240
00:19:27.914 --> 00:19:29.499
Well, is it?

241
00:19:30.375 --> 00:19:32.877
They're all crowding in on you,
Mr. Harding.

242
00:19:32.877 --> 00:19:34.170
They're all ganging up on you.

243
00:19:34.087 --> 00:19:35.797
Is that news?

244
00:19:37.298 --> 00:19:39.801
They sometimes want to gang up
on me, too, but I..

245
00:19:39.801 --> 00:19:41.719
Cheswick, do me a favor.

246
00:19:41.594 --> 00:19:43.304
Take it easy.

247
00:19:43.513 --> 00:19:46.015
- And stay off my side.
- But I only want to...

248
00:19:46.015 --> 00:19:47.934
I only want to help you.

249
00:19:47.892 --> 00:19:49.811
- I understand.
- But don't you want me to..?

250
00:19:49.811 --> 00:19:52.313
- Please!
- But I only want to...

251
00:19:52.313 --> 00:19:54.816
- Please!
- But I only want to help you.

252
00:19:54.816 --> 00:19:56.234
Please!

253
00:19:58.486 --> 00:19:59.779
You see...

254
00:19:59.779 --> 00:20:03.199
...the other day you made some allusions,
both of you.

255
00:20:03.491 --> 00:20:05.785
- Illusions?
- Yes, allusions.

256
00:20:06.703 --> 00:20:08.621
Not illusions. Allusions...

257
00:20:08.496 --> 00:20:11.583
...to sexual problems
I might be having with my wife.

258
00:20:11.708 --> 00:20:14.794
Let's say it's true! Let's say
I know it's true, but you don't!

259
00:20:14.794 --> 00:20:17.297
If that's your idea of trying
to tell me something..

260
00:20:17.297 --> 00:20:20.383
You know, Harding, I think you're
some kind of morbid asshole!

261
00:20:20.383 --> 00:20:22.302
- "Peculiar!"
- "Asshole" again.

262
00:20:22.302 --> 00:20:23.595
It makes you feel "peculiar."

263
00:20:23.511 --> 00:20:25.430
You've talked about your wife
ever since I can remember!

264
00:20:25.388 --> 00:20:27.891
You know, she's on your mind,
and blah, blah...

265
00:20:27.891 --> 00:20:29.184
I'm not talking about my wife!

266
00:20:29.225 --> 00:20:31.728
When will you get that through your thick,
fucking head?

267
00:20:31.686 --> 00:20:34.189
When are you gonna wise up
and turn her loose?

268
00:20:34.189 --> 00:20:36.691
- Please!
- I don't want to hear it!

269
00:20:36.691 --> 00:20:39.402
- I'm tired.
- I don't want to hear it!

270
00:20:41.112 --> 00:20:42.405
I'm tired.

271
00:20:42.322 --> 00:20:44.407
I don't want to hear it.

272
00:20:44.824 --> 00:20:46.117
I don't want to hear it.

273
00:20:46.117 --> 00:20:48.620
It's a lot of baloney and I'm tired.

274
00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.538
I don't want to hear it!

275
00:20:50.413 --> 00:20:52.332
We know you're tired. We're all tired.

276
00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:56.211
- I'm tired and it's a lot of baloney.
- You're not tired, Bancini.

277
00:20:57.921 --> 00:21:00.006
Take your hands off me!

278
00:21:07.722 --> 00:21:09.807
Take your hands off me!

279
00:21:27.116 --> 00:21:29.410
Recreation time, gentlemen.

280
00:21:29.619 --> 00:21:30.912
The bus is waiting.

281
00:21:30.912 --> 00:21:34.207
All nonrestricted patients
please report to the bus.

282
00:21:58.231 --> 00:22:00.525
Ever play this game, Chief?

283
00:22:05.113 --> 00:22:07.198
Come on, I'll show you.

284
00:22:07.615 --> 00:22:09.409
Old Indian game.

285
00:22:10.118 --> 00:22:12.912
It's called "put the ball in the hole".

286
00:22:15.123 --> 00:22:18.418
Now, that ought to be just...
Hold it right there.

287
00:22:18.835 --> 00:22:19.419
All right.

288
00:22:19.502 --> 00:22:22.005
Now, that's your spot. Don't move.

289
00:22:22.005 --> 00:22:24.507
Never move. That's your spot,
you understand?

290
00:22:24.507 --> 00:22:27.010
Right there. You don't move. Now...

291
00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:28.803
...take the ball.

292
00:22:29.512 --> 00:22:31.514
Here, take the ball.

293
00:22:32.015 --> 00:22:34.225
That's it. Hold on to it.

294
00:22:34.517 --> 00:22:37.020
Not too hard, Chief.
You'll crush all the air out of it.

295
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:40.106
We're gonna put her in the basket.
You understand?

296
00:22:40.106 --> 00:22:42.692
All right. Now, raise up your arms.

297
00:22:43.234 --> 00:22:46.321
Raise the ball up in the air, Chief.
Raise it up.

298
00:22:46.446 --> 00:22:47.739
McMurphy?

299
00:22:47.614 --> 00:22:51.409
What the hell are you talking to him for?
He can't hear a fucking thing.

300
00:22:51.409 --> 00:22:55.205
I ain't talking to him.
I'm talking to myself. It helps me think.

301
00:22:55.121 --> 00:22:57.707
Yeah, well, it don't help him none.

302
00:22:58.333 --> 00:23:00.835
Well, it don't hurt him, either, does it?

303
00:23:00.835 --> 00:23:03.254
Don't hurt you, does it, Chief?

304
00:23:03.338 --> 00:23:05.340
See? Don't hurt him.

305
00:23:07.634 --> 00:23:09.636
All right, now, Chief.

306
00:23:10.845 --> 00:23:13.348
Let's raise our hands up in the air.

307
00:23:13.348 --> 00:23:14.641
Just raise them up.

308
00:23:14.516 --> 00:23:16.434
Up, you understand?

309
00:23:16.434 --> 00:23:17.727
Raise the hands up, here.

310
00:23:17.644 --> 00:23:19.562
Up. Raise your hands up.

311
00:23:19.521 --> 00:23:22.524
Up! That's it! That's it!
Up, all the way up.

312
00:23:23.316 --> 00:23:26.110
All the way up. That's a baby, all right.

313
00:23:27.028 --> 00:23:28.738
Okay, now...

314
00:23:29.531 --> 00:23:33.034
Now, jump up in the air,
and put it in the basket, Chief.

315
00:23:33.326 --> 00:23:35.411
Jump up and dunk it in!

316
00:23:36.454 --> 00:23:40.375
Jump up in the air and stuff
that son of a bitch in there, Chief.

317
00:23:42.043 --> 00:23:43.962
Take a rest, Chief.

318
00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.423
Just stay right there.
Take a rest. I'll be right back.

319
00:23:52.053 --> 00:23:54.556
Bancini, come here for a minute.

320
00:23:54.556 --> 00:23:57.058
You're looking all right.
Get right over here for a second.

321
00:23:57.141 --> 00:23:59.435
Now, just stand right there.

322
00:23:59.644 --> 00:24:02.146
Just get down a little bit.
All right. Stand up.

323
00:24:02.146 --> 00:24:04.065
Stand up. Go ahead.

324
00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.859
That's a baby! All right, you got it.

325
00:24:05.859 --> 00:24:08.152
All right. Now, over there.

326
00:24:09.654 --> 00:24:12.740
Hit me, Chief! I got the moves!
I got them, Chief!

327
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:14.659
Hold it right there. Give me the ball.

328
00:24:14.659 --> 00:24:17.162
Give me the ball. That's it.
Thank you, Chief.

329
00:24:17.162 --> 00:24:18.454
Now...

330
00:24:18.329 --> 00:24:19.622
...hold it right there.

331
00:24:19.622 --> 00:24:22.709
You take the ball, you jump up,
and put it in the basket.

332
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:25.837
See what I mean? Put it...
Bancini, hold still.

333
00:24:25.837 --> 00:24:28.339
All right, Chief, here. Take the ball.

334
00:24:28.339 --> 00:24:31.342
Now, jump up and put it
in the basket, Chief!

335
00:24:32.135 --> 00:24:34.053
Jump up and put it in the basket!

336
00:24:34.053 --> 00:24:35.346
Not you, Bancini.

337
00:24:35.263 --> 00:24:37.182
Raise up! Bancini, where you going?

338
00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.641
I'm tired!

339
00:24:39.058 --> 00:24:41.477
Fast break! Defense! Get back!

340
00:24:43.354 --> 00:24:46.441
Come on, Bancini,
where the fuck you going at?

341
00:24:46.566 --> 00:24:48.484
General, get this man around here.

342
00:24:48.359 --> 00:24:50.153
That's it, back!

343
00:24:50.236 --> 00:24:51.946
Over to Chief.

344
00:24:52.155 --> 00:24:54.866
Fast break! Fast break! Hit me, Chief!

345
00:24:55.241 --> 00:24:56.951
Hit me, baby!

346
00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.454
Put it in the basket, Chief!

347
00:24:59.662 --> 00:25:01.664
Put it in the basket!

348
00:25:02.749 --> 00:25:04.751
Put it in the basket!

349
00:25:19.641 --> 00:25:21.142
All right.

350
00:25:22.769 --> 00:25:24.479
Make the bets.

351
00:25:24.646 --> 00:25:25.939
What's this?

352
00:25:25.939 --> 00:25:27.649
Make the bets.

353
00:25:27.857 --> 00:25:29.859
It's a dime, Martini.

354
00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.153
I bet a nickel.

355
00:25:32.862 --> 00:25:35.156
A dime's the limit, Martini.

356
00:25:37.158 --> 00:25:38.868
I bet a dime.

357
00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.334
This is not a dime, Martini.

358
00:25:48.461 --> 00:25:50.255
This is a dime.

359
00:25:50.964 --> 00:25:52.882
If you break it in haIf...

360
00:25:52.841 --> 00:25:55.760
...you don't get two nickels, you get shit.

361
00:25:55.969 --> 00:25:58.471
Try and smoke it. You understand?

362
00:26:00.348 --> 00:26:02.851
You don't understand!
All right, here they come.

363
00:26:02.851 --> 00:26:05.937
Queen to the Chesser,
Big Bull to Tabulations...

364
00:26:05.979 --> 00:26:09.774
...ten to Billy to match his whang,
and the dealer gets a three.

365
00:26:10.358 --> 00:26:12.151
Hit me. Hit me.

366
00:26:12.277 --> 00:26:16.072
I can't hit you because it ain't
your turn yet. You understand?

367
00:26:15.947 --> 00:26:18.449
You see these other people?
These are the real ones.

368
00:26:18.449 --> 00:26:20.743
These are real people here.

369
00:26:22.245 --> 00:26:24.747
What'll you do, Ches? Hit or sit?

370
00:26:31.671 --> 00:26:33.089
Hit me.

371
00:26:33.464 --> 00:26:35.550
That's 23 up, Cheswick.

372
00:26:35.967 --> 00:26:37.886
Taber, you're busted. Give me this.

373
00:26:37.886 --> 00:26:39.596
Twenty-three.

374
00:26:39.762 --> 00:26:41.681
- Hit me.
- Shut up!

375
00:26:42.265 --> 00:26:42.849
Taber.

376
00:26:42.849 --> 00:26:44.767
- Give me a dime!
- I'm next.

377
00:26:44.767 --> 00:26:46.561
You're not next!

378
00:26:47.854 --> 00:26:49.147
Hit me.

379
00:26:49.189 --> 00:26:50.982
- Ace.
- Hit me.

380
00:26:50.982 --> 00:26:52.775
That's 4 or 14.

381
00:26:53.484 --> 00:26:55.778
Don't want any more. Billy?

382
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.156
- Hit me. Hit me.
- Five.

383
00:27:00.366 --> 00:27:04.162
You didn't make a bet, Martini.
I can't hit you. Jesus Christ.

384
00:27:04.787 --> 00:27:05.371
I bet a dime.

385
00:27:05.371 --> 00:27:07.165
All right, here.

386
00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:09.209
- That's 20 showing.
- No.

387
00:27:09.167 --> 00:27:11.085
- Take your money.
- No.

388
00:27:11.085 --> 00:27:12.378
It's not.

389
00:27:12.253 --> 00:27:14.339
It's 10, 11, 12, 13.

390
00:27:17.258 --> 00:27:19.761
This is a fucking queen here,
you understand?

391
00:27:19.761 --> 00:27:22.472
You don't count the this and the this.

392
00:27:22.889 --> 00:27:24.307
Hit me.

393
00:27:24.682 --> 00:27:26.184
Hit me.

394
00:27:24.682 --> 00:27:25.975
You got 20 showing!

395
00:27:25.975 --> 00:27:28.478
Hit me again. I want another card.

396
00:27:28.478 --> 00:27:31.064
Scanlon, who's pitching the opener?

397
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:33.983
Medication time.

398
00:27:34.067 --> 00:27:35.985
This isn't a queen!

399
00:27:38.488 --> 00:27:40.073
Mac, hit me.

400
00:27:41.574 --> 00:27:43.493
- Who's pitching the opener?
- Hit me.

401
00:27:43.493 --> 00:27:44.786
Jesus Christ Almighty!

402
00:27:44.661 --> 00:27:47.163
Do you nuts want to play cards
or do you want to fucking jerk off?

403
00:27:47.163 --> 00:27:48.456
Play the game!

404
00:27:48.498 --> 00:27:51.501
I can't even hear myself think already, here.

405
00:28:00.385 --> 00:28:01.678
Stay back!

406
00:28:01.594 --> 00:28:04.097
- Excuse me, ma'am. I just wanted to..
- Stay back!

407
00:28:04.097 --> 00:28:06.599
Patients aren't allowed
in the nurses' station.

408
00:28:06.599 --> 00:28:09.018
Well, I just wanted to turn...

409
00:28:09.686 --> 00:28:13.481
When you're outside, we'll discuss
whatever problem you have, okay?

410
00:28:13.481 --> 00:28:17.277
The patients are not allowed
in the nurses' station. All right?

411
00:28:20.989 --> 00:28:24.075
Let me get in here, will you, Hard-on?
Thank you.

412
00:28:24.075 --> 00:28:25.869
Excuse me, miss.

413
00:28:25.994 --> 00:28:29.080
Do you think it might be possible
to turn the music down...

414
00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.083
...so maybe a couple of the boys
could talk?

415
00:28:32.876 --> 00:28:35.670
That music is for everyone, Mr. McMurphy.

416
00:28:36.588 --> 00:28:39.090
I know, but do you think
we might ease it down a little...

417
00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:42.010
...so maybe the boys didn't have to shout?

418
00:28:43.469 --> 00:28:45.388
What you probably don't realize...

419
00:28:45.388 --> 00:28:47.891
...is that we have a lot of old men
in this ward...

420
00:28:47.891 --> 00:28:51.311
...who couldn't hear the music
if we turned it lower.

421
00:28:51.603 --> 00:28:53.897
That music is all they have.

422
00:28:55.398 --> 00:28:57.901
Your hand is staining my window.

423
00:28:59.777 --> 00:29:02.197
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- All right.

424
00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:05.909
Mr. McMurphy, your medication.

425
00:29:07.911 --> 00:29:09.204
What's in the horse pill?

426
00:29:09.204 --> 00:29:11.122
It's just medicine. It's good for you.

427
00:29:10.997 --> 00:29:15.418
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of taking
something if I don't know what it is.

428
00:29:15.376 --> 00:29:17.795
Don't get upset, Mr. McMurphy.

429
00:29:17.879 --> 00:29:20.381
I'm not getting upset, Miss Pilbow.

430
00:29:20.381 --> 00:29:24.177
It's just that I don't want anyone
to try and slip me saltpeter.

431
00:29:25.386 --> 00:29:27.388
You know what I mean?

432
00:29:27.889 --> 00:29:29.807
It's all right, Nurse Pilbow.

433
00:29:29.807 --> 00:29:33.520
If Mr. McMurphy doesn't want
to take his medication orally...

434
00:29:34.187 --> 00:29:37.982
...I'm sure we can arrange
that he can have it some other way.

435
00:29:39.192 --> 00:29:42.278
But I don't think you'd like it,
Mr. McMurphy.

436
00:29:44.781 --> 00:29:46.074
You'd like it, wouldn't you, Hard-on?

437
00:29:46.115 --> 00:29:47.826
Give it to me.

438
00:29:48.618 --> 00:29:49.911
Good.

439
00:29:56.709 --> 00:29:58.211
Very good!

440
00:29:59.796 --> 00:30:01.214
Yummy!

441
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:07.095
Mr. Harding?

442
00:30:09.222 --> 00:30:10.640
Merci.

443
00:30:23.611 --> 00:30:25.530
Tell me, lover-boy...

444
00:30:25.488 --> 00:30:28.491
...why didn't you tell her to go fuck herself?

445
00:30:34.205 --> 00:30:35.915
Jesus Christ.

446
00:30:38.001 --> 00:30:40.420
Funny, huh? That's funny, huh?

447
00:30:40.503 --> 00:30:44.090
You know that wasn't very smart.
She could have seen that.

448
00:30:47.427 --> 00:30:50.722
God Almighty,
she's got you guys coming and going.

449
00:30:51.097 --> 00:30:54.184
What do you think she is?
Some kind of a champ or something?

450
00:30:54.225 --> 00:30:56.728
No, I thought you were the champ.

451
00:30:56.811 --> 00:30:58.605
You want to bet?

452
00:30:59.314 --> 00:31:00.899
Bet on what?

453
00:31:01.816 --> 00:31:03.109
One week.

454
00:31:03.026 --> 00:31:05.528
I bet in one week I can put a bug
so far up her ass...

455
00:31:05.528 --> 00:31:07.447
...she won't know whether to shit
or wind her wrist watch.

456
00:31:07.405 --> 00:31:10.492
What do you say to that? Want to bet?
Do you want to bet?

457
00:31:10.492 --> 00:31:12.410
One week. That's all I need.
Who wants to bet?

458
00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:15.121
You want to bet? Bet a buck. One buck.

459
00:31:16.122 --> 00:31:17.624
I'll bet.

460
00:31:18.625 --> 00:31:20.835
Tabes in, one buck. Solid.

461
00:31:23.922 --> 00:31:28.927
Tabes in, one buck. Solid.

462
00:31:23.922 --> 00:31:25.840
Last time we were discussing...

463
00:31:25.798 --> 00:31:28.301
...Mr. Harding and the problem
with his wife...

464
00:31:28.301 --> 00:31:31.513
...and I think we were making
a lot of progress.

465
00:31:32.096 --> 00:31:34.599
So who would like to begin today?

466
00:31:39.604 --> 00:31:41.314
Mr. McMurphy?

467
00:31:42.732 --> 00:31:45.818
I've been thinking about
what you said about...

468
00:31:47.111 --> 00:31:50.031
...you know, getting things off your chest.

469
00:31:52.116 --> 00:31:56.120
Well, there's a couple of things
that I'd like to get off my chest.

470
00:31:56.538 --> 00:31:59.624
Well, that's very good, Mr. McMurphy.
Go ahead.

471
00:32:00.834 --> 00:32:04.337
Today, as you may or may not know,
it doesn't matter...

472
00:32:04.629 --> 00:32:07.340
...is the opening of the World Series.

473
00:32:07.715 --> 00:32:11.719
What I'd like to suggest is that
we change the work detail tonight...

474
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.431
...so that we can watch the ball game.

475
00:32:17.725 --> 00:32:20.520
Well, Mr. McMurphy, what you're asking...

476
00:32:21.521 --> 00:32:25.108
...is that we change
a very carefully worked out schedule.

477
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:29.612
A little change never hurt, huh?

478
00:32:29.612 --> 00:32:31.406
A little variety?

479
00:32:32.115 --> 00:32:35.201
Well, it's not necessarily true,
Mr. McMurphy.

480
00:32:35.243 --> 00:32:39.455
Some men on the ward take a long,
long time to get used to the schedule.

481
00:32:40.915 --> 00:32:44.002
Change it now,
and they might find it very disturbing.

482
00:32:44.043 --> 00:32:47.839
Fuck the schedule! They can go back
to the schedule after the Series.

483
00:32:47.839 --> 00:32:51.134
I'm talking about the World Series,
Nurse Ratched.

484
00:32:52.135 --> 00:32:55.430
Well, anyway, this is no way
to proceed about this.

485
00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:58.516
How would it be if we had a vote...

486
00:32:59.017 --> 00:33:01.311
...and let the majority rule?

487
00:33:01.519 --> 00:33:03.605
Great. Let's vote on it.

488
00:33:05.315 --> 00:33:08.109
So, all those in favor raise your hands.

489
00:33:12.822 --> 00:33:14.824
Okay, guys, come on.

490
00:33:15.325 --> 00:33:17.243
Put your hands up.

491
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:24.334
What's the matter with you?
Don't you want to watch the World Series?

492
00:33:24.751 --> 00:33:27.253
Get your hands up.
It can do you some good...

493
00:33:27.253 --> 00:33:30.757
...to get some exercise,
putting your arms up in the air.

494
00:33:30.924 --> 00:33:33.218
That's it. Come on, let's...

495
00:33:42.852 --> 00:33:44.771
What is this crap?

496
00:33:44.729 --> 00:33:47.815
I watch the Series.
I haven't missed the Series in years.

497
00:33:47.857 --> 00:33:52.278
Even in the cooler. When I'm in the cooler
they run it there or they'll have a riot.

498
00:33:52.237 --> 00:33:55.949
What's the matter with you guys?
Come on, be good Americans!

499
00:33:59.744 --> 00:34:02.831
Well, Mr. McMurphy,
I only count three votes, and...

500
00:34:02.831 --> 00:34:05.917
...that's not enough
to change the ward policy.

501
00:34:06.042 --> 00:34:07.544
I'm sorry.

502
00:34:12.549 --> 00:34:14.050
I'm sorry.

503
00:34:12.549 --> 00:34:14.634
My turn. Okay, hot dice.

504
00:34:15.051 --> 00:34:17.053
I want a ten to go...

505
00:34:17.554 --> 00:34:19.472
... 'cause I need cash.

506
00:34:19.347 --> 00:34:21.266
I want to get to Mediterranean Avenue.

507
00:34:21.224 --> 00:34:23.017
Big ten! Perfect.

508
00:34:23.142 --> 00:34:24.644
Two fives.

509
00:34:28.147 --> 00:34:30.066
- What are you doing?
-Hotel.

510
00:34:30.024 --> 00:34:32.527
- You do not have a hotel there.
- Hotel.

511
00:34:32.527 --> 00:34:34.445
For the third time...

512
00:34:34.362 --> 00:34:36.865
- ...you do not have a hotel on Boardwalk.
- Hotel.

513
00:34:36.948 --> 00:34:40.243
- It costs $1,000 and four green houses...
- Hotel.

514
00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:42.579
- ...to put a hotel on Boardwalk.
- Hotel.

515
00:34:42.537 --> 00:34:45.331
Play the game and knock off the bullshit.

516
00:34:45.665 --> 00:34:46.958
Play the game, Harding.

517
00:34:46.958 --> 00:34:48.251
What are you talking about?
I am playing the game.

518
00:34:48.168 --> 00:34:50.670
-Play the game!
- I ain't doing anything to you!

519
00:34:50.628 --> 00:34:51.921
-What bullshit?
- Your bullshit!

520
00:34:51.963 --> 00:34:53.882
-What about your bullshit?
- Play the game!

521
00:34:53.756 --> 00:34:55.675
-You keep your hands off me!
- Play the game!

522
00:34:55.633 --> 00:34:56.926
I've had enough bullshit out of you!

523
00:34:56.968 --> 00:34:59.470
- Play the game.
- What the fuck are you picking on me for?

524
00:34:59.429 --> 00:35:00.722
Play the game, Harding.

525
00:35:00.638 --> 00:35:03.725
- I'm trying to ignore you, see?
- Just play the game.

526
00:35:03.766 --> 00:35:05.059
Keep your hands off me, you son of a bitch!

527
00:35:05.059 --> 00:35:07.645
Keep your hands off me! You hear me?

528
00:35:08.855 --> 00:35:11.941
- Come on, come on.
- I can be pushed just so far, see!

529
00:35:11.941 --> 00:35:13.234
Play the game.

530
00:35:13.151 --> 00:35:15.653
You touch me once more.
Just touch me once more!

531
00:35:15.653 --> 00:35:18.156
Just once more, huh? Just once more!

532
00:35:18.156 --> 00:35:20.658
- Just touch me once more!
- Play the game, Harding!

533
00:35:20.658 --> 00:35:22.577
Just touch me once more!

534
00:35:22.535 --> 00:35:24.120
Holy Jesus!

535
00:35:42.555 --> 00:35:45.767
Is that what your schedule
does for you, Hard-on?

536
00:35:46.976 --> 00:35:48.686
Damn lunatic!

537
00:35:48.853 --> 00:35:50.772
I don't know what you're talking about.

538
00:35:50.772 --> 00:35:53.691
No? Well, then stay all wet, Harding, huh?

539
00:35:53.858 --> 00:35:56.945
'Cause I'm going downtown
to watch the World Series, anyway.

540
00:35:56.945 --> 00:35:58.863
Anybody want to come with me?

541
00:35:58.863 --> 00:36:01.366
I do, Mac. I want to go with you!

542
00:36:01.366 --> 00:36:03.785
Ches, all right. Anybody else?

543
00:36:03.868 --> 00:36:06.162
- Where?
- Any bar downtown.

544
00:36:06.955 --> 00:36:08.748
Mac, you can't...

545
00:36:08.873 --> 00:36:11.084
...can't get out of here.

546
00:36:12.669 --> 00:36:14.671
Anybody want to bet?

547
00:36:15.755 --> 00:36:17.465
Chicken shits!

548
00:36:18.883 --> 00:36:21.386
Maybe he'll just show Nurse Ratched
his big thing...

549
00:36:21.344 --> 00:36:23.930
...and she'll open the door for him.

550
00:36:26.349 --> 00:36:28.268
Yeah, maybe I will...

551
00:36:28.268 --> 00:36:32.063
...and then maybe I'll use your
thick skull and knock a hole in the wall.

552
00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:33.565
Sefelt, see?

553
00:36:37.068 --> 00:36:40.071
Why? My head would squash
like an eggplant.

554
00:36:41.364 --> 00:36:44.450
Fuck Sefelt's head,
I don't need Sefelt's head!

555
00:36:44.576 --> 00:36:46.494
I'll take this fucking thing,
and put it through the window...

556
00:36:46.369 --> 00:36:49.455
...and me and Cheswick will go out
through the hall...

557
00:36:49.581 --> 00:36:52.667
...downtown, sit down in a bar,
wet our whistles...

558
00:36:52.667 --> 00:36:54.586
...and watch the ball game.

559
00:36:54.586 --> 00:36:58.006
And that's the bet.
Now, does anybody want any of it?

560
00:36:59.549 --> 00:37:02.051
You're going to lift that thing?

561
00:37:02.677 --> 00:37:04.596
Yeah! That's right.

562
00:37:06.472 --> 00:37:08.266
I'll bet a buck.

563
00:37:08.975 --> 00:37:10.560
Taber, $1.

564
00:37:11.477 --> 00:37:13.188
I bet a dime.

565
00:37:13.271 --> 00:37:14.564
Mac, you can't...

566
00:37:14.564 --> 00:37:16.774
...can't Iift that thing.

567
00:37:19.569 --> 00:37:22.280
Anybody else want any of it? Hard-on?

568
00:37:25.158 --> 00:37:26.868
I'll bet $25!

569
00:37:28.286 --> 00:37:29.996
$25, Hard-on!

570
00:37:32.665 --> 00:37:35.460
Mac, nobody could ever lift that thing.

571
00:37:37.086 --> 00:37:39.589
Get out of my way, son.
You're using my oxygen.

572
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:41.591
You know what I mean?

573
00:37:42.675 --> 00:37:44.177
All right.

574
00:37:45.178 --> 00:37:46.679
All right.

575
00:37:59.567 --> 00:38:01.069
Giving up?

576
00:38:03.988 --> 00:38:05.990
No! Just warming up.

577
00:38:06.491 --> 00:38:08.076
Warming up.

578
00:38:08.993 --> 00:38:10.995
This will be the one.

579
00:38:13.998 --> 00:38:15.792
All right, baby.

580
00:39:04.007 --> 00:39:06.509
But I tried, didn't I? Goddamn it!

581
00:39:07.177 --> 00:39:09.179
At least I did that.

582
00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:18.813
At least I did that.

583
00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:18.897
And on the mound, the left-hander,
Al Downing.

584
00:39:19.606 --> 00:39:22.692
The two pitchers still warming up,
right down below us.

585
00:39:22.692 --> 00:39:25.695
The second game of
the 1963 World Series...

586
00:39:25.904 --> 00:39:28.990
...is being brought to you
from Yankee Stadium.

587
00:39:33.411 --> 00:39:36.414
Did you tell the girl
how you feIt about her?

588
00:39:47.091 --> 00:39:49.385
I went over to her house...

589
00:39:50.303 --> 00:39:52.722
...one Sunday afternoon and...

590
00:39:54.599 --> 00:39:57.185
...and I brought her some flowers...

591
00:40:03.399 --> 00:40:05.193
...and I said...

592
00:40:08.988 --> 00:40:11.074
..."Celia, will you...

593
00:40:15.286 --> 00:40:17.080
"...marry me?"

594
00:40:39.018 --> 00:40:41.437
Why did you want to marry her?

595
00:40:44.023 --> 00:40:46.317
Well, I was in love with her.

596
00:40:49.696 --> 00:40:53.116
Your mother told me
that you never told her about it.

597
00:41:03.418 --> 00:41:05.920
Why didn't you tell her about it?

598
00:41:19.726 --> 00:41:23.229
Wasn't that the first time
you tried to commit suicide?

599
00:41:31.613 --> 00:41:33.198
Oh, my God!

600
00:41:34.699 --> 00:41:36.618
Yes, Mr. Cheswick?

601
00:41:36.618 --> 00:41:38.411
Miss Ratched...

602
00:41:38.536 --> 00:41:41.456
...I'd like to ask you a question, please.

603
00:41:41.623 --> 00:41:43.124
Go ahead.

604
00:41:44.709 --> 00:41:46.211
Okay...

605
00:41:46.628 --> 00:41:48.421
You know, if...

606
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:51.841
...Billy doesn't feel like talking...

607
00:41:52.217 --> 00:41:54.802
...I mean, why are you pressing him?

608
00:41:56.012 --> 00:41:58.806
Why can't we go on to some new business?

609
00:42:00.433 --> 00:42:03.436
The business of this meeting,
Mr. Cheswick...

610
00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.230
...is therapy.

611
00:42:09.108 --> 00:42:12.195
You know, I don't understand this,
Miss Ratched...

612
00:42:12.237 --> 00:42:14.239
...because I don't...

613
00:42:14.739 --> 00:42:16.032
Mr. McMurphy...

614
00:42:16.032 --> 00:42:19.244
He said something yesterday
about a World Series.

615
00:42:21.037 --> 00:42:22.831
A baseball game?

616
00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:27.043
You know, and I've never been
to a baseball game and...

617
00:42:27.335 --> 00:42:29.754
...I think I'd like to see one.

618
00:42:31.631 --> 00:42:35.218
That would be good therapy, too,
wouldn't it, Miss Ratched?

619
00:42:35.426 --> 00:42:37.929
I thought we'd decided that issue.

620
00:42:40.431 --> 00:42:43.017
I don't think so, because, I mean...

621
00:42:43.518 --> 00:42:46.020
...we discussed that yesterday...

622
00:42:46.729 --> 00:42:50.233
...and we have a new game today,
I think, don't we, Mac?

623
00:42:50.441 --> 00:42:54.028
That's right, Ches, and we want
a new vote on it, don't we?

624
00:42:57.949 --> 00:43:01.035
Would one more vote satisfy you,
Mr. McMurphy?

625
00:43:01.744 --> 00:43:03.037
Yeah.

626
00:43:02.912 --> 00:43:04.706
It'd satisfy me.

627
00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.543
There's a vote before the group.

628
00:43:08.543 --> 00:43:12.547
Everyone in favor of changing
the schedule, please raise your hand.

629
00:43:16.718 --> 00:43:19.512
Okay, I want to see the hands. Come on!

630
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:23.224
Which one of you nuts has got any guts?

631
00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.442
All right. That's it!

632
00:43:32.942 --> 00:43:35.653
I only count nine votes, Mr. McMurphy.

633
00:43:36.154 --> 00:43:39.449
She only counts nine. Only nine!
It's a landslide.

634
00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:43.745
There are 18 patients
on this ward, Mr. McMurphy...

635
00:43:44.245 --> 00:43:47.749
...and you have to have a majority
to change ward policy.

636
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:52.170
So you gentlemen
can put your hands down.

637
00:43:56.758 --> 00:44:00.261
Are you trying to tell me
that you're gonna count these?

638
00:44:00.553 --> 00:44:04.557
These poor sons of bitches,
they don't know what we're talking about.

639
00:44:04.849 --> 00:44:07.936
Well, I have to disagree with you,
Mr. McMurphy.

640
00:44:08.061 --> 00:44:11.356
These men are members of the ward,
just as you are.

641
00:44:14.234 --> 00:44:17.028
All right. All I need is one vote, right?

642
00:44:17.445 --> 00:44:18.738
Right?

643
00:44:18.655 --> 00:44:20.156
All right.

644
00:44:21.157 --> 00:44:22.450
Okay.

645
00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:26.079
Want to watch the World Series?

646
00:44:26.162 --> 00:44:28.081
This could be a big moment for you.

647
00:44:28.039 --> 00:44:29.958
You want to watch a baseball game?

648
00:44:29.958 --> 00:44:31.251
You want to watch baseball?

649
00:44:31.125 --> 00:44:33.044
Just raise that hand up.
Just raise the hand up.

650
00:44:33.044 --> 00:44:35.547
- What do you say?
- I gave it all to her.

651
00:44:35.547 --> 00:44:36.965
Sorry.

652
00:44:37.465 --> 00:44:39.384
Bancini, old horse.

653
00:44:39.259 --> 00:44:42.345
What do you say?
You want to watch the ball game on TV?

654
00:44:42.428 --> 00:44:44.931
Want to watch the ball game?
Baseball? World Series?

655
00:44:44.931 --> 00:44:47.433
What do you say, pal? You're tired?

656
00:44:47.433 --> 00:44:50.520
Just raise your hand up, Bancini.
Watch the ball game, huh?

657
00:44:50.562 --> 00:44:52.772
I'm tired. Awfully tired.

658
00:44:53.064 --> 00:44:54.858
Okay. All right.

659
00:44:54.941 --> 00:44:56.234
What about you, pal?

660
00:44:56.151 --> 00:44:58.069
All we need's one vote. Just one vote.

661
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:59.988
Just your one vote. That's all we need.

662
00:44:59.946 --> 00:45:03.950
Just raise your hand up and your buddies
can watch the baseball game.

663
00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:12.458
General, you remember, don't you?

664
00:45:12.458 --> 00:45:14.961
October, the banner, the stars...

665
00:45:14.961 --> 00:45:17.046
"Oh, say can you..."

666
00:45:17.463 --> 00:45:20.383
The World Series.
Raise your hand up, Gen.

667
00:45:21.843 --> 00:45:23.928
Just raise your hand up.

668
00:45:25.555 --> 00:45:28.641
What about you pal, huh?
Want to watch the ball game?

669
00:45:28.766 --> 00:45:32.770
Want to watch the ball game, huh?
Just one vote. Just raise your...

670
00:45:33.062 --> 00:45:34.981
Gentlemen, the meeting is adjourned.

671
00:45:34.939 --> 00:45:37.442
For Christ's sake, isn't there
one of you fucking maniacs...

672
00:45:37.442 --> 00:45:38.735
...that knows what I'm talking about?

673
00:45:38.776 --> 00:45:40.487
Mr. McMurphy?

674
00:45:41.863 --> 00:45:43.156
The meeting is adjourned.

675
00:45:43.072 --> 00:45:45.575
Just wait a minute, will you?
Just one minute?

676
00:45:45.575 --> 00:45:48.077
You can bring the subject up
again tomorrow.

677
00:45:48.161 --> 00:45:50.079
All right, Chief...

678
00:45:50.663 --> 00:45:53.166
...you're our last chance. What do you say?

679
00:45:53.166 --> 00:45:54.459
Just raise your hand up.

680
00:45:54.375 --> 00:45:56.294
That's all we need from you today, Chief.

681
00:45:56.252 --> 00:45:58.171
Just raise your hand up one time.

682
00:45:58.171 --> 00:46:00.465
Show her that you can do it.

683
00:46:00.673 --> 00:46:02.592
Show her that you can still do it.

684
00:46:02.467 --> 00:46:04.969
Just raise your hand up.
All the guys have got them up.

685
00:46:04.969 --> 00:46:08.056
Just raise your hand up, Chief.
Will you? Huh?

686
00:46:11.851 --> 00:46:15.647
Come on, there's got to be one guy here
that's not a total fucking nut!

687
00:46:15.647 --> 00:46:16.940
Mac?

688
00:46:18.775 --> 00:46:20.568
Chief! The Chief!

689
00:46:21.861 --> 00:46:24.364
Nurse Ratched? Nurse Ratched, look!

690
00:46:24.364 --> 00:46:26.866
Look. The Chief put his hand up.

691
00:46:26.866 --> 00:46:29.369
The Chief put his hand up. Look, he voted.

692
00:46:29.369 --> 00:46:32.372
Would you please turn
the television set on?

693
00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:35.500
The Chief has got his hand up, right there.

694
00:46:36.876 --> 00:46:38.795
The Chief voted. Now...

695
00:46:38.753 --> 00:46:41.256
...will you please turn the television set on?

696
00:46:41.256 --> 00:46:42.549
Mr. McMurphy...

697
00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:45.051
...the meeting was adjourned,
and the vote was closed.

698
00:46:45.051 --> 00:46:48.847
But the vote was ten to eight.
The Chief, he's got his hand up! Look!

699
00:46:48.763 --> 00:46:50.056
No, Mr. McMurphy.

700
00:46:50.056 --> 00:46:53.643
When the meeting was adjourned,
the vote was nine to nine.

701
00:46:55.061 --> 00:46:56.980
Come on, you're not going to say that now!

702
00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:58.898
You're not going to say that now!

703
00:46:58.773 --> 00:47:00.692
You're going to pull that henhouse shit,
now, when the vote...

704
00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:02.569
The Chief just voted! It was ten to nine!

705
00:47:02.569 --> 00:47:05.780
I want that television set turned on!
Right now!

706
00:47:11.953 --> 00:47:13.538
Cheswick...

707
00:47:16.958 --> 00:47:19.544
- I want to watch television.
- No, you have a work assignment.

708
00:47:19.586 --> 00:47:23.298
- I want to watch television.
- No, you have a work assignment.

709
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:41.608
Koufax.

710
00:47:42.066 --> 00:47:44.277
Koufax kicks. He delivers.

711
00:47:45.195 --> 00:47:47.113
It's up the middle, it's a base hit.

712
00:47:47.071 --> 00:47:48.990
Richardson's rounding first!
He's going for second!

713
00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:50.909
The ball's in to deep right center!

714
00:47:50.783 --> 00:47:52.702
Davidson, over in the corner,
cuts the ball off!

715
00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:54.579
Here comes the throw.
Richardson's around the dirt!

716
00:47:54.579 --> 00:47:56.498
He slides, he's in there.
He's safe! It's a double!

717
00:47:56.498 --> 00:47:58.416
He's in there, Martini!
Look at Richardson, he's on second base.

718
00:47:58.291 --> 00:48:01.377
Koufax is in big fucking trouble!
Big trouble, baby!

719
00:48:01.461 --> 00:48:03.963
All right, here's Tresh.
He's the next batter!

720
00:48:03.963 --> 00:48:05.882
Tresh looks in. Koufax...

721
00:48:05.798 --> 00:48:08.885
Koufax gets the sign from Roseboro!
He kicks once, he pumps...

722
00:48:08.968 --> 00:48:12.764
It's a strike! Koufax's curve ball is
snapping off like a fucking firecracker.

723
00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.599
Here he comes with the next pitch.

724
00:48:14.599 --> 00:48:18.102
Tresh swings!
It's a long fly ball to deep left center!

725
00:48:19.562 --> 00:48:21.564
It's going! It's gone!

726
00:48:27.695 --> 00:48:30.782
Somebody give me a fucking wiener
before I die.

727
00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:35.787
It's the great Mickey Mantle, now!
Here comes the pitch!

728
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:37.580
Mantle swings!

729
00:48:37.789 --> 00:48:39.707
It's a fucking home run!

730
00:48:39.582 --> 00:48:41.584
Gentlemen, stop this.

731
00:48:42.794 --> 00:48:44.796
Stop this immediately.

732
00:48:49.968 --> 00:48:51.970
Stop this immediately.

733
00:48:54.389 --> 00:48:56.391
Do you like it here?

734
00:49:00.603 --> 00:49:02.689
That fucking nurse, man!

735
00:49:03.773 --> 00:49:05.775
What do you mean, sir?

736
00:49:14.993 --> 00:49:16.786
She ain't honest.

737
00:49:20.707 --> 00:49:24.794
Miss Ratched's one of the finest nurses
we've got in this institution.

738
00:49:27.505 --> 00:49:30.592
Well, I don't want to break up
the meeting or nothing...

739
00:49:30.675 --> 00:49:33.887
...but she's something of a cunt,
ain't she, Doc?

740
00:49:34.387 --> 00:49:36.389
How do you mean that?

741
00:49:37.599 --> 00:49:40.685
She likes a rigged game,
you know what I mean?

742
00:49:46.316 --> 00:49:49.611
Well, you know,
I've been observing you here now...

743
00:49:50.111 --> 00:49:52.405
...for the last four weeks...

744
00:49:52.614 --> 00:49:56.201
...and I don't see any evidence
of mental illness, at all.

745
00:49:56.284 --> 00:49:59.996
I think that you've been trying
to put us on, all this time.

746
00:50:01.289 --> 00:50:04.375
You know, what do you want me to do?
You know.

747
00:50:06.294 --> 00:50:07.587
You know what I mean? Is that it?

748
00:50:07.587 --> 00:50:09.881
Is that crazy enough for you?

749
00:50:10.089 --> 00:50:13.092
Want me to take a shit on the floor?
Christ!

750
00:50:14.511 --> 00:50:18.723
Have you ever heard the old saying,
"A rolling stone gathers no moss?".

751
00:50:20.099 --> 00:50:21.392
Yeah.

752
00:50:22.602 --> 00:50:25.104
Does that mean something to you?

753
00:50:29.526 --> 00:50:33.321
It's the same as "Don't wash
your dirty underwear in public".

754
00:50:34.489 --> 00:50:37.283
I'm not sure I understand what you mean.

755
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:41.329
I'm smarter than him, ain't I?

756
00:50:43.915 --> 00:50:46.709
Well that, sort of, has always meant...

757
00:50:47.001 --> 00:50:50.797
...it's hard for something to grow
on something that's moving.

758
00:50:51.422 --> 00:50:54.509
How did you feel about
what happened yesterday?

759
00:51:00.098 --> 00:51:02.517
I wanted to kill... I mean...

760
00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:14.320
Do you gentlemen have
any more questions?

761
00:51:16.406 --> 00:51:19.325
I don't have any more, but perhaps you do.

762
00:51:19.534 --> 00:51:22.036
Do you have a question, McMurphy?

763
00:51:21.995 --> 00:51:24.414
Where do you suppose she lives?

764
00:51:26.332 --> 00:51:28.751
Where do you suppose she lives?

765
00:51:55.737 --> 00:51:57.822
Chief, come on with me.

766
00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:03.203
We'll show these guys who's nuts.

767
00:52:04.537 --> 00:52:06.331
All right, wait.

768
00:52:06.331 --> 00:52:08.124
Stand right here.

769
00:52:08.833 --> 00:52:11.044
All right. Grab the fence.

770
00:52:12.629 --> 00:52:14.547
Grab the fence here.

771
00:52:14.506 --> 00:52:16.716
Right here, Chief. Strong!

772
00:52:17.008 --> 00:52:19.093
Strong, like this, here.

773
00:52:22.013 --> 00:52:24.015
That's it. All right.

774
00:52:24.516 --> 00:52:26.017
Okay. Up.

775
00:52:27.644 --> 00:52:28.937
That's it.

776
00:52:28.937 --> 00:52:30.939
All right, you got it?

777
00:52:37.028 --> 00:52:38.822
All right, push!

778
00:53:21.447 --> 00:53:23.158
Come on, Bob!

779
00:53:23.324 --> 00:53:25.326
Where are you going?

780
00:53:26.452 --> 00:53:29.747
Don't breathe on me, Club.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

781
00:53:33.334 --> 00:53:36.129
Come on, you guys. Get the lead out, huh?

782
00:53:44.554 --> 00:53:46.472
Hey, what the hell's going on here?

783
00:53:46.431 --> 00:53:48.141
Wait a minute!

784
00:53:48.933 --> 00:53:50.435
Hold it!

785
00:53:50.852 --> 00:53:52.770
See how easy it is?

786
00:54:30.225 --> 00:54:31.518
Boys.

787
00:54:33.353 --> 00:54:35.271
This here is Candy.

788
00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:37.315
Candy, this is the boys.

789
00:54:52.163 --> 00:54:53.873
You all crazy?

790
00:54:59.254 --> 00:55:00.964
You all crazy?

791
00:55:19.941 --> 00:55:21.860
Let's go. Down here.

792
00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:24.445
- Isn't this wonderful?
- Down here.

793
00:55:25.572 --> 00:55:27.157
No problem.

794
00:55:28.658 --> 00:55:30.243
Right here.

795
00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:35.373
Come on, we don't want to be late
for our first day out.

796
00:55:39.377 --> 00:55:40.795
Hello!

797
00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:49.929
Come on, will you?
What are you standing around for?

798
00:55:49.971 --> 00:55:52.390
Get on board. Give them these.

799
00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:58.855
Hey, wait a minute!
What the heck is going on here?

800
00:55:59.355 --> 00:56:01.274
What are you doing on this boat?

801
00:56:01.274 --> 00:56:03.193
We're going fishing.

802
00:56:03.067 --> 00:56:05.361
No, you're not going fishing.

803
00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:09.073
Not on this boat.
You're not going fishing on this boat.

804
00:56:09.365 --> 00:56:12.285
Oh, yeah, on this boat. Ask Captain Block.

805
00:56:12.452 --> 00:56:15.538
- Captain Block?
- Captain Block. Yes, that's right.

806
00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:17.165
Who are you?

807
00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:20.543
We're from the...

808
00:56:21.252 --> 00:56:23.671
...State Mental Institution...

809
00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:26.299
This is Dr. Cheswick...

810
00:56:26.257 --> 00:56:28.760
...Dr. Taber, Dr. Fredrickson...

811
00:56:29.385 --> 00:56:31.179
...Dr. Scanlon.

812
00:56:31.262 --> 00:56:33.181
The famous Dr. Scanlon.

813
00:56:33.181 --> 00:56:35.391
Mr. Harding, Dr. Bibbit...

814
00:56:35.683 --> 00:56:37.685
...Dr. Martini, and...

815
00:56:38.186 --> 00:56:39.896
...Dr. Sefelt.

816
00:56:41.856 --> 00:56:44.150
How about you? Who are you?

817
00:56:44.359 --> 00:56:46.861
I'm Dr. McMurphy. R.P. McMurphy.

818
00:56:51.866 --> 00:56:53.785
Wait, wait... Wait one second.

819
00:56:53.785 --> 00:56:55.703
You don't understand.
We chartered the boat.

820
00:56:55.662 --> 00:56:57.580
We're going to go fishing.

821
00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:59.999
And that's all there is to it.

822
00:57:05.672 --> 00:57:07.590
You better quit on this.

823
00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:10.093
They'll throw you in the can again,
you know?

824
00:57:10.051 --> 00:57:12.345
No, they won't. We're nuts!

825
00:57:13.179 --> 00:57:16.391
They'll just take us back
to the feeb farm, see?

826
00:57:17.559 --> 00:57:19.978
Von Sefelt, get the stern line.

827
00:57:21.271 --> 00:57:23.189
Tabes, you're at the bow.

828
00:57:23.189 --> 00:57:24.691
This one?

829
00:57:26.985 --> 00:57:29.404
That one! The one at your feet.

830
00:57:36.286 --> 00:57:38.204
Get back on! Jesus!

831
00:57:41.958 --> 00:57:43.376
Tabes!

832
00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:30.673
Come here, quick!

833
00:58:37.597 --> 00:58:39.516
Aye, aye, sir. I mean, yes, Mac!

834
00:58:39.474 --> 00:58:43.269
Take it easy, Charlie.
Have you ever driven one of these things?

835
00:58:43.269 --> 00:58:45.480
- Driven one of...
- Yeah.

836
00:58:45.772 --> 00:58:47.273
No, Mac.

837
00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:49.776
Well, it's a lot of fun.

838
00:58:50.193 --> 00:58:52.111
Come on over here.
Put your hands on the wheel.

839
00:58:51.986 --> 00:58:53.905
- Put your hands on.
- I've never done this.

840
00:58:53.905 --> 00:58:56.991
Put your hands on the wheel
so you don't fall down. All right.

841
00:58:56.991 --> 00:58:59.494
Just hold it steady right there, like that.

842
00:58:59.494 --> 00:59:00.787
- Steady?
- Steady, yeah.

843
00:59:00.787 --> 00:59:02.705
Now just go straight.

844
00:59:02.705 --> 00:59:05.208
- Straight as an arrow, Charlie.
- Straight, Mac?

845
00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:07.126
- Just straight. That's right.
- But, Mac...

846
00:59:07.001 --> 00:59:09.504
Mac, this thing ain't too steady.

847
00:59:12.006 --> 00:59:13.925
- Where are we going, Mac?
- Straight.

848
00:59:13.883 --> 00:59:15.468
Just go on!

849
00:59:25.812 --> 00:59:27.605
This is the bait.

850
00:59:29.607 --> 00:59:31.317
Little fishes.

851
00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:32.986
Dead fishes.

852
00:59:33.278 --> 00:59:34.571
That's right.

853
00:59:34.612 --> 00:59:38.032
Now what are we going to do
with these little fishes?

854
00:59:40.201 --> 00:59:43.913
- Catch big fishes.
- That's right. That's right, Mr. Martini.

855
00:59:46.499 --> 00:59:47.917
Hooks.

856
00:59:48.293 --> 00:59:49.711
Hooks.

857
00:59:51.504 --> 00:59:53.423
Now, hold on to your hooks...

858
00:59:53.298 --> 00:59:55.717
...'cause here are the fishes.

859
00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:57.218
Tabes.

860
01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:01.973
Get a fish here.

861
01:00:02.098 --> 01:00:04.184
There, for you, Martini.

862
01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:07.812
All right, now we, each one of us
has got a fish.

863
01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:09.606
What are you laughing at, Martini?

864
01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:11.524
You're not an idiot, huh?

865
01:00:11.483 --> 01:00:14.986
You're not a goddamn looney now, boy,
you're a fisherman.

866
01:00:16.488 --> 01:00:18.781
Now, take your bottom hook.

867
01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.784
You got it?

868
01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:25.121
You take it...

869
01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:26.915
...and you...

870
01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:29.542
...push it all the way through.

871
01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:31.127
Like that.

872
01:00:31.503 --> 01:00:34.005
Wait a second.
Get it through the eyes, here.

873
01:00:34.005 --> 01:00:35.924
- Right through here.
- In the eye?

874
01:00:35.924 --> 01:00:38.426
Don't worry about it! He's dead, Martini.

875
01:00:38.426 --> 01:00:41.721
Jesus Christ, just put it
through his eyeball, here.

876
01:00:42.096 --> 01:00:43.389
That's it.

877
01:00:43.389 --> 01:00:46.476
Crunch it right through.
All right. Now you got it, see?

878
01:00:46.518 --> 01:00:49.604
Now, you just pull that baby through.
You see what I mean?

879
01:00:49.604 --> 01:00:53.316
And you wrap it around.
You pull this so it's a little loop.

880
01:00:53.399 --> 01:00:54.692
That's very good.

881
01:00:54.609 --> 01:00:57.111
That's very good, Mr. Fredrickson!

882
01:00:57.111 --> 01:00:58.404
Very good eye work.

883
01:00:58.404 --> 01:01:00.114
Good eye work.

884
01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:04.118
That little devil's gonna
not even feel the sting, is he, boy?

885
01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:07.288
That son of a gun
is going to bite on you, isn't he?

886
01:01:08.414 --> 01:01:10.500
You got beautiful hair.

887
01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:15.505
Thank you.

888
01:01:19.717 --> 01:01:21.427
And you got...

889
01:01:24.013 --> 01:01:25.932
...beautiful eyes.

890
01:01:27.809 --> 01:01:29.310
Thank you.

891
01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:34.732
Billy, what's the matter?
Fishing don't grab you?

892
01:01:40.321 --> 01:01:41.823
They do.

893
01:01:42.824 --> 01:01:44.742
Now, come on with me, over here.

894
01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:47.787
I'm gonna give each
and every one of you a rod.

895
01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:55.420
All right.

896
01:01:55.336 --> 01:01:57.255
Here's your poles.

897
01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:08.141
Here's your poles.

898
01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:13.396
Now, just keep watching the tip here.
If you get a strike, let me know.

899
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:15.023
Understand?

900
01:02:14.939 --> 01:02:17.734
Come on, Candy. Just keep fishing, guys!

901
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:20.612
Don't call me unless you get
something really big...

902
01:02:20.612 --> 01:02:23.031
...you can't handle yourselves.

903
01:02:26.826 --> 01:02:28.620
Keep on fishing!

904
01:02:30.622 --> 01:02:32.332
That's right.

905
01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:06.366
Where is everybody?

906
01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:20.839
Cheswick! Goddamn it, I told you to...

907
01:03:21.339 --> 01:03:23.633
...steer that boat straight!

908
01:03:28.847 --> 01:03:30.640
Fish! Help, help!

909
01:03:31.933 --> 01:03:35.937
Goddamn it, he's got a fish. Hold it!
Wait a minute, Tabes. I got it!

910
01:03:36.354 --> 01:03:39.440
Cheswick, get the fuck back up there!
Get up there in front!

911
01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.526
Tabes, I got it, Tabes!

912
01:03:41.943 --> 01:03:44.445
Get up, Tabes, I'll get it for you!

913
01:03:44.445 --> 01:03:47.740
Son of a bitch, he's going over here!
Get up there!

914
01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:49.742
I got it!

915
01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:55.748
I got it! Give it to me!

916
01:03:55.748 --> 01:03:58.251
Hey, Harding, I'm the skipper of this boat.

917
01:03:58.251 --> 01:03:59.544
Shut up!

918
01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:02.255
He said to go straight out as an arrow.

919
01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:05.049
You're not going straight, you're kind of...

920
01:04:05.049 --> 01:04:08.261
I'm going straight enough.
Now, Chessy, stop it!

921
01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:11.347
- It's my duty!
- Chessy, stop it!

922
01:04:15.727 --> 01:04:17.812
No, you son of a bitch!

923
01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:22.066
All right, Martini.

924
01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:24.861
All right, take him over!

925
01:04:25.153 --> 01:04:26.863
Take him over!

926
01:04:26.946 --> 01:04:29.365
That's it! Now play them, boys!

927
01:04:30.158 --> 01:04:32.160
You sons of bitches!

928
01:04:33.244 --> 01:04:35.038
Keep it straight!

929
01:04:35.747 --> 01:04:37.665
Come back this way!

930
01:05:10.156 --> 01:05:12.659
Home safe and sound. Didn't lose a nut!

931
01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:15.245
Beats bowling, you know what I mean?

932
01:05:17.664 --> 01:05:18.957
We caught it, look!

933
01:05:18.957 --> 01:05:23.253
They're gonna be trolling this place
for six months looking for dead bodies!

934
01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:31.261
They're gonna be trolling this place
for six months looking for dead bodies!

935
01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:33.179
I think he's dangerous.

936
01:05:33.137 --> 01:05:34.931
He's not crazy...

937
01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:36.891
...but he's dangerous.

938
01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:38.143
You don't think he's crazy?

939
01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:40.061
No, he's not crazy.

940
01:05:42.564 --> 01:05:44.149
Dr. Songee?

941
01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:47.652
I don't think he's overly psychotic.

942
01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:51.281
But I still think he's quite sick.

943
01:05:51.239 --> 01:05:54.242
- Do you think he's dangerous?
- Absolutely so.

944
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:59.873
Well, John, what do you want
to do with him?

945
01:06:03.168 --> 01:06:05.461
I think we've had our turn.

946
01:06:06.254 --> 01:06:09.549
I'd like to send him back
to the work farm, frankly.

947
01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:14.470
Is there anybody that you have...

948
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.890
...on your staff, that could...

949
01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:19.476
...relate to him? Maybe understand him.

950
01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:22.270
Help him out with some of these problems?

951
01:06:22.562 --> 01:06:25.648
The funny thing is that
the person that he's the closest to...

952
01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:28.234
...is the one he dislikes the most.

953
01:06:28.776 --> 01:06:30.778
That's you, Mildred.

954
01:06:31.279 --> 01:06:35.366
Well, gentlemen, in my opinion,
if we send him back to Pendleton or...

955
01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:38.161
...we send him up to Disturbed...

956
01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:42.165
...it's just one more way of passing on
our problem to somebody else.

957
01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:45.752
You know, we don't like to do that.

958
01:06:47.587 --> 01:06:50.173
So I'd like to keep him on the ward.

959
01:06:51.382 --> 01:06:53.468
I think we can help him.

960
01:06:56.971 --> 01:06:58.264
I think we can help him.

961
01:06:58.264 --> 01:07:00.266
Chief, Chief, come on.

962
01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:03.269
Come with me, huh?

963
01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:06.564
Chief, this is the spot.

964
01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:10.777
Right there is the spot. Remember?

965
01:07:10.777 --> 01:07:13.196
Raise the hands, in the basket.

966
01:07:13.279 --> 01:07:15.698
That's it. Raise the hands up.

967
01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:19.577
All right! Let's have a little ball
from you nuts in here! Here we go!

968
01:07:19.577 --> 01:07:22.664
All right! Let's play some ball, nuts.
Let's make some moves!

969
01:07:22.664 --> 01:07:24.582
Hey, Mac, Mac. Time, time, time.

970
01:07:24.582 --> 01:07:27.085
You've got six men on the court.

971
01:07:28.294 --> 01:07:30.713
Harding, out of the ball game.

972
01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:33.383
Hey, why me?

973
01:07:33.258 --> 01:07:35.760
Because I'm the coach. I'll put you in later.

974
01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.679
I don't trust you.

975
01:07:40.765 --> 01:07:42.058
I'll go.

976
01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:45.854
Okay, good boy, Billy.
I'll put you in in a minute, all right?

977
01:07:47.689 --> 01:07:50.191
Let's play ball. Harding, break over there.

978
01:07:50.191 --> 01:07:52.110
All right, Martini, get it back. Back!

979
01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:53.987
I'm in the open! What are you doing?

980
01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:55.905
You threw the goddamn ball into the fence!

981
01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:58.283
Christ Almighty, you threw
the ball into the fence!

982
01:07:58.283 --> 01:08:00.785
There's nobody there! We're playing ball!

983
01:08:00.785 --> 01:08:05.081
All right, come on, get in the game.
Defense, nobody's doing nothing here!

984
01:08:05.165 --> 01:08:07.667
- For Christ's sake!
- Hey, Mac, I'm open! I'm open!

985
01:08:07.667 --> 01:08:10.753
Harding, give it back.
Back to me, Harding! Here.

986
01:08:10.795 --> 01:08:12.714
I'm open.
Harding, will you give me the ball?

987
01:08:12.672 --> 01:08:15.175
-Stop dribbling the goddamn ball!
-I got it!

988
01:08:15.175 --> 01:08:17.093
Harding, over here.

989
01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:19.596
Oh, for Christ's sake. I'm standing..

990
01:08:19.596 --> 01:08:21.514
- You were covered!
- I was open!

991
01:08:21.473 --> 01:08:23.975
Just give me the ball.
They're making all over the..

992
01:08:23.975 --> 01:08:26.269
I was open. Give me the ball.

993
01:08:26.478 --> 01:08:30.190
- You were covered, Mac.
- I wasn't covered. Somebody get back!

994
01:08:31.483 --> 01:08:33.776
Give it to me! Give it to me!

995
01:08:35.195 --> 01:08:37.614
Chief! Thatta baby, put it in!

996
01:08:42.702 --> 01:08:44.496
Get down there!

997
01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:50.793
Get down there, Chief! All right, all right.

998
01:08:54.005 --> 01:08:55.924
Get around, Chief!

999
01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:01.513
No, no, no. Get down there, Chief!

1000
01:09:01.471 --> 01:09:04.057
The ball's in play! Ball's in play!

1001
01:09:04.599 --> 01:09:07.185
- That's bullshit!
- Ball's in play.

1002
01:09:07.811 --> 01:09:10.313
Oh, fuck that shit! You've got to be crazy.

1003
01:09:10.271 --> 01:09:13.483
Man, that doesn't go!
Get that ball in and play!

1004
01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:16.820
Come on, Chief! Put it in!

1005
01:09:27.205 --> 01:09:28.998
What a ball club!

1006
01:09:29.415 --> 01:09:31.209
What a ball club!

1007
01:09:56.901 --> 01:09:59.195
McMurphy, get off the side.

1008
01:10:00.113 --> 01:10:02.907
- Come on, move it, man!
- Hey, damn it!

1009
01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:05.410
Quick! Come on, go ahead.

1010
01:10:06.911 --> 01:10:08.413
Go ahead.

1011
01:10:10.081 --> 01:10:11.583
Go ahead.

1012
01:10:12.584 --> 01:10:16.087
I'll be seeing you on the outside.
You know what I mean?

1013
01:10:16.296 --> 01:10:18.798
By the time you get out of here...

1014
01:10:18.798 --> 01:10:21.301
...you'll be too old to even get it up.

1015
01:10:21.301 --> 01:10:23.386
Sixty-eight days, buddy.

1016
01:10:23.803 --> 01:10:25.096
Sixty-eight days.

1017
01:10:25.096 --> 01:10:27.891
What the fuck you talking about, 68 days!

1018
01:10:28.224 --> 01:10:30.310
That's in jail, sucker.

1019
01:10:30.685 --> 01:10:33.396
You still don't know where you're at?

1020
01:10:33.813 --> 01:10:36.316
Yeah, where am I at, Washington?

1021
01:10:36.316 --> 01:10:38.735
With us, baby, you're with us.

1022
01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:42.113
And you're gonna stay with us
until we let you go.

1023
01:10:46.993 --> 01:10:50.288
And you're gonna stay with us
until we let you go.

1024
01:10:50.705 --> 01:10:54.209
Do you want to say something
to the group, Mr. McMurphy?

1025
01:10:58.922 --> 01:11:02.717
I'd like to know why none of the guys
never told me that you...

1026
01:11:04.511 --> 01:11:05.803
...Miss Ratched...

1027
01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:10.308
...and the doctors could keep me here till
you're good and ready to turn me loose.

1028
01:11:12.018 --> 01:11:13.937
That's what I'd like to know.

1029
01:11:13.895 --> 01:11:16.481
Fine, Randall, that's a good start.

1030
01:11:17.023 --> 01:11:19.943
Would anyone care
to answer Mr. McMurphy?

1031
01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:23.613
Answer what?

1032
01:11:23.905 --> 01:11:25.824
You heard me, Harding.

1033
01:11:25.824 --> 01:11:28.326
You let me go on hassling
Nurse Ratched here...

1034
01:11:28.326 --> 01:11:32.121
...knowing how much I had to lose
and you never told me nothing!

1035
01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:34.541
Now, Mac, wait a minute.

1036
01:11:34.499 --> 01:11:37.001
Wait a minute, I didn't know anything
about how much..

1037
01:11:37.001 --> 01:11:39.420
- Shit!
- Wait a minute. Listen.

1038
01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:40.713
Now, look...

1039
01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:43.800
I'm voluntary here, see?
I'm not committed.

1040
01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:49.597
I don't have to stay here.
I mean, I can go home anytime I want.

1041
01:11:50.807 --> 01:11:53.309
You can go home anytime you want?

1042
01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:55.812
- That's it.
- You're bullshitting me!

1043
01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:58.106
He's bullshitting me, right?

1044
01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:01.109
No, Randall, he's telling you the truth.

1045
01:12:02.026 --> 01:12:06.030
As a matter of fact, there are
very few men here who are committed.

1046
01:12:06.406 --> 01:12:08.324
There's Mr. Bromden.

1047
01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:09.826
Mr. Taber.

1048
01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:13.246
Some of the chronics, and you.

1049
01:12:19.627 --> 01:12:21.129
Cheswick?

1050
01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:23.923
You're voluntary?

1051
01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:29.846
Scanlon?

1052
01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:37.020
Billy, for Christ's sake,
you must be committed, right?

1053
01:12:37.145 --> 01:12:38.730
No, no, no.

1054
01:12:43.943 --> 01:12:45.236
You're just a young kid!

1055
01:12:45.236 --> 01:12:48.323
What are you doing here?
You ought to be out in a convertible...

1056
01:12:48.323 --> 01:12:50.241
...bird-dogging chicks and banging beaver.

1057
01:12:50.241 --> 01:12:52.744
What are you doing here, for Christ's sake?

1058
01:12:52.744 --> 01:12:55.038
What's so funny about that?

1059
01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:59.626
Jesus, I mean, you guys do nothing
but complain about how you can't...

1060
01:12:59.626 --> 01:13:03.421
...stand it in this place, and then
you haven't got the guts to walk out?

1061
01:13:03.338 --> 01:13:07.258
What do you think you are,
for Christ's sake? Crazy or something?

1062
01:13:09.052 --> 01:13:11.346
Well, you're not. You're not!

1063
01:13:11.513 --> 01:13:14.599
You're no crazier than the average asshole
walking around on the streets.

1064
01:13:14.641 --> 01:13:16.351
And that's it.

1065
01:13:17.143 --> 01:13:19.646
Jesus Christ, I can't believe it!

1066
01:13:24.651 --> 01:13:28.238
Those are very challenging observations
you made, Randall.

1067
01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:33.326
I'm sure some of the men
would like to comment.

1068
01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:38.706
Mr. Scanlon?

1069
01:13:39.624 --> 01:13:43.628
I want to know why the dorm is locked
in the daytime and on weekends.

1070
01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:53.847
I would like to know about our cigarettes.

1071
01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:59.018
May I have my cigarettes,
please, Miss Ratched?

1072
01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:02.147
You sit down, Mr. Cheswick,
and wait your turn.

1073
01:14:05.358 --> 01:14:07.277
Go ahead, sit down!

1074
01:14:14.659 --> 01:14:18.163
To answer your question
about the dorm, Mr. Scanlon...

1075
01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:19.747
You know very well...

1076
01:14:19.747 --> 01:14:24.335
...that if we left the door open, you'd just
go right back to bed after breakfast.

1077
01:14:24.752 --> 01:14:26.337
Am I right?

1078
01:14:26.546 --> 01:14:28.047
So what?

1079
01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:30.967
May I have my cigarettes,
please, Miss Ratched?

1080
01:14:30.925 --> 01:14:32.844
Forget the cigarettes, Cheswick.

1081
01:14:32.844 --> 01:14:35.930
Cigarettes are not important.
Sit down, will you?

1082
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:37.849
For Christ's sake!

1083
01:14:40.351 --> 01:14:41.936
Cigarettes!

1084
01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:48.443
Remember, Mr. Scanlon,
we've discussed many times...

1085
01:14:48.443 --> 01:14:52.238
...that time spent in the company
of others is very therapeutic.

1086
01:14:52.864 --> 01:14:56.951
While time spent brooding alone
only increases a feeling of separation.

1087
01:14:57.869 --> 01:14:59.162
You remember that, don't you?

1088
01:14:59.162 --> 01:15:01.164
Do you mean to say...

1089
01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:04.167
...it's sick to want to be off by yourself?

1090
01:15:04.167 --> 01:15:05.877
Miss Ratched?

1091
01:15:07.253 --> 01:15:09.547
Mr. Cheswick, you sit down!

1092
01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:12.842
- I want to know about...
- Sit down, Mr. Cheswick.

1093
01:15:12.842 --> 01:15:14.552
I want to...

1094
01:15:15.345 --> 01:15:17.263
Give him a cigarette, will you, Harding?

1095
01:15:17.263 --> 01:15:19.057
It's my last one.

1096
01:15:19.766 --> 01:15:22.852
That's a fucking lie.
Why don't you give him a cigarette?

1097
01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:25.355
Look, I'm not running a charity ward, see?

1098
01:15:25.355 --> 01:15:26.648
Come on!

1099
01:15:26.648 --> 01:15:29.150
Look, I don't want his cigarettes.

1100
01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:31.945
And I don't want his, or his, or his...

1101
01:15:32.237 --> 01:15:34.531
...or his, or his, or his...

1102
01:15:35.365 --> 01:15:37.075
Or even yours.

1103
01:15:37.242 --> 01:15:39.160
Do you understand that?

1104
01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.746
I want my cigarettes, Miss Ratched!

1105
01:15:42.247 --> 01:15:44.165
I want my cigarettes!

1106
01:15:44.165 --> 01:15:46.376
I want mine, Miss Ratched!

1107
01:15:46.668 --> 01:15:49.170
What gives you the damn right...

1108
01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:52.465
...to keep our cigarettes
piled up on your desk...

1109
01:15:52.966 --> 01:15:56.678
...and to squeeze out a pack
only when you feel like it, huh?

1110
01:15:58.555 --> 01:16:00.849
- Miss Ratched!
- Mr. Harding!

1111
01:16:04.144 --> 01:16:05.436
Oh, I'm sorry.

1112
01:16:05.478 --> 01:16:08.481
- You surprise me.
- I lost my head. I'm sorry.

1113
01:16:08.565 --> 01:16:10.483
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

1114
01:16:10.441 --> 01:16:12.360
I'm really very sorry. I just forgot.

1115
01:16:12.277 --> 01:16:15.780
I didn't mean to.
I'm really very sorry. I just forgot.

1116
01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:17.866
It's all right.

1117
01:16:17.949 --> 01:16:19.659
Miss Ratched!

1118
01:16:19.868 --> 01:16:21.786
Yes, Mr. Cheswick?

1119
01:16:21.661 --> 01:16:23.746
I asked you a question!

1120
01:16:24.164 --> 01:16:26.875
I heard your question, Mr. Cheswick...

1121
01:16:27.375 --> 01:16:31.296
...and I will answer your question
as soon as you've calmed down.

1122
01:16:35.466 --> 01:16:37.760
Are you calm, Mr. Cheswick?

1123
01:16:38.553 --> 01:16:40.472
- I'm calm.
- Good.

1124
01:16:42.348 --> 01:16:45.059
Now, as you all know, Mr. McMurphy...

1125
01:16:45.477 --> 01:16:49.189
...has been running
a small gambling casino in our tub room.

1126
01:16:49.856 --> 01:16:53.568
Now, most of you lost
all your cigarettes to Mr. McMurphy...

1127
01:16:53.568 --> 01:16:56.988
...not to mention a tidy sum of money
to Mr. McMurphy.

1128
01:16:58.573 --> 01:16:59.866
And that's why...

1129
01:16:59.866 --> 01:17:03.161
...your tub room privileges
have been suspended...

1130
01:17:03.578 --> 01:17:06.498
...and your cigarettes have been rationed.

1131
01:17:09.876 --> 01:17:11.461
Mr. Martini?

1132
01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:15.757
How are we going to win our money back?

1133
01:17:19.886 --> 01:17:23.306
You're not going to win
your money back, Mr. Martini.

1134
01:17:23.681 --> 01:17:25.475
That's all over.

1135
01:17:25.475 --> 01:17:27.393
If you had obeyed the rules
in the first place...

1136
01:17:27.393 --> 01:17:30.104
...you wouldn't have lost your money.

1137
01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:42.575
Sit down, gentlemen!
Sit down, gentlemen! Sit down!

1138
01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:50.583
Rules?

1139
01:17:50.583 --> 01:17:53.086
Piss on your fucking rules, Miss Ratched!

1140
01:17:53.086 --> 01:17:55.004
Sit down, will you, Cheswick!

1141
01:17:54.879 --> 01:17:57.382
I want you to know something
right here and now, Miss Ratched!

1142
01:17:57.382 --> 01:18:01.094
- I ain't no little kid! I ain't no little kid!
- You sit down!

1143
01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:04.264
Where you're going to have cigarettes
kept from me like cookies...

1144
01:18:04.264 --> 01:18:06.766
And I want something done!
Ain't that right, Mac?

1145
01:18:06.766 --> 01:18:08.685
That's right! Will you sit down!

1146
01:18:08.685 --> 01:18:10.687
No, I won't! I won't!

1147
01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:13.106
I want something done!

1148
01:18:13.064 --> 01:18:15.567
- Sit down!
- I want something done!

1149
01:18:15.567 --> 01:18:17.569
I want something done!

1150
01:18:18.069 --> 01:18:19.362
I want something done!

1151
01:18:19.279 --> 01:18:21.281
I want something done!

1152
01:18:21.781 --> 01:18:23.783
I want something done!

1153
01:18:25.577 --> 01:18:27.996
- Here!
- I want something done!

1154
01:18:28.079 --> 01:18:29.998
Goddamn it, Cheswick, here!

1155
01:18:29.998 --> 01:18:31.791
Hey, calm down!

1156
01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:35.879
Why don't you leave him alone,
Washington? He's going to be all right!

1157
01:18:44.971 --> 01:18:46.556
Emergency...

1158
01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:48.391
...34-B.

1159
01:18:50.602 --> 01:18:52.896
I'll break your fucking back!

1160
01:18:59.402 --> 01:19:02.197
Forget it, Mac! It's all over, McMurphy!

1161
01:19:04.991 --> 01:19:06.409
Warren!

1162
01:19:20.882 --> 01:19:22.300
Warren!

1163
01:19:46.491 --> 01:19:48.409
Would you move, please?
We need this chair.

1164
01:19:48.409 --> 01:19:50.912
Just move right over there, okay.

1165
01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:57.710
I see we have Mr. Bromden back.
Yeah, okay.

1166
01:20:02.215 --> 01:20:05.301
- How do you do, Mr. McMurphy?
- I do real fine.

1167
01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:07.804
I know you didn't do anything wrong.
Just sit down.

1168
01:20:07.804 --> 01:20:09.722
We're not going to hurt you.
Sit down, right here.

1169
01:20:09.722 --> 01:20:11.015
That's it.

1170
01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:13.393
Nurse, this is Mr. Cheswick.
He's a little upset.

1171
01:20:13.393 --> 01:20:15.895
Okay, fine. Thank you very much.

1172
01:20:15.895 --> 01:20:18.398
- You'll be okay, Mr. Cheswick.
- Yes.

1173
01:20:18.398 --> 01:20:21.109
Would you keep an eye on these three?

1174
01:21:11.618 --> 01:21:14.412
Would you please take these, gentlemen?

1175
01:21:14.704 --> 01:21:16.706
He can't hear nothing.

1176
01:21:24.130 --> 01:21:26.341
Calm down, Ches, will you?

1177
01:21:26.633 --> 01:21:29.427
Mr. Cheswick, would you please follow me?

1178
01:21:32.222 --> 01:21:33.932
Mr. Cheswick?

1179
01:21:39.103 --> 01:21:41.606
- No!
- Nobody's going to hurt you, come on.

1180
01:21:41.606 --> 01:21:43.817
- No!
- It'll be all right.

1181
01:21:44.734 --> 01:21:46.027
No one's going to hurt you.

1182
01:21:46.027 --> 01:21:47.320
No, leave me alone!

1183
01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:49.823
- Take it easy on yourself. Come on!
- No! Mac!

1184
01:21:49.823 --> 01:21:51.324
Mac! Mac!

1185
01:21:52.325 --> 01:21:53.618
No!

1186
01:21:53.535 --> 01:21:55.954
Come on. Come on, now. Come on.

1187
01:21:56.621 --> 01:21:58.414
- Come on.
- No!

1188
01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:00.542
I didn't do nothing!

1189
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.293
Mac!

1190
01:22:03.503 --> 01:22:06.422
- Come on.
- I won't go! I don't want to go!

1191
01:22:29.237 --> 01:22:30.947
Want some gum?

1192
01:22:34.826 --> 01:22:36.327
Thank you.

1193
01:22:58.641 --> 01:23:00.226
Juicy Fruit.

1194
01:23:02.937 --> 01:23:05.356
You sly son of a bitch, Chief.

1195
01:23:09.819 --> 01:23:11.821
Can you hear me, too?

1196
01:23:12.322 --> 01:23:14.032
Yeah, you bet!

1197
01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:16.659
Well, I'll be goddamned, Chief!

1198
01:23:19.829 --> 01:23:23.124
And they all, they all think
you're deaf and dumb.

1199
01:23:24.834 --> 01:23:26.544
Jesus Christ!

1200
01:23:28.630 --> 01:23:30.715
You fooled them, Chief.

1201
01:23:31.132 --> 01:23:33.635
You fooled them. You fooled them all!

1202
01:23:33.635 --> 01:23:35.220
Goddamn you!

1203
01:23:39.224 --> 01:23:41.726
What are we doing in here, Chief?

1204
01:23:43.645 --> 01:23:46.856
What's us, two guys,
doing in this fucking place?

1205
01:23:54.239 --> 01:23:56.241
Let's get out of here.

1206
01:23:57.450 --> 01:23:58.743
Out.

1207
01:24:03.623 --> 01:24:05.041
Canada?

1208
01:24:06.125 --> 01:24:07.418
Canada.

1209
01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:11.256
We'll be there before these
sons of bitches know what hit 'em.

1210
01:24:13.633 --> 01:24:16.052
Listen to Randall on this one.

1211
01:24:36.865 --> 01:24:38.575
Mr. McMurphy?

1212
01:24:39.367 --> 01:24:41.161
Please follow me.

1213
01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:47.458
You and me, Chief.

1214
01:24:59.929 --> 01:25:02.515
Take a cigarette break, boys. Easy.

1215
01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:07.270
I'll be fine.

1216
01:25:14.944 --> 01:25:16.863
Would you sit up, please?

1217
01:25:16.863 --> 01:25:18.781
- I'd love to.
- Thatta boy.

1218
01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:22.535
There might be a little fluid in them boots,
you know what I mean, boys?

1219
01:25:22.452 --> 01:25:24.370
Just a little leak.

1220
01:25:24.954 --> 01:25:26.873
A light shine, boys, and...

1221
01:25:26.873 --> 01:25:29.584
...send the specimen to Nurse Ratched.

1222
01:25:38.176 --> 01:25:40.094
All right, out with your gum.

1223
01:25:39.969 --> 01:25:41.888
Out with your gum.

1224
01:25:45.642 --> 01:25:49.229
Okay, this won't hurt,
and it'll be over in just a moment.

1225
01:25:49.354 --> 01:25:51.648
- What's that?
- Conductant.

1226
01:25:51.856 --> 01:25:53.775
A little dab will do you.

1227
01:25:53.775 --> 01:25:55.693
Right, Mr. Jackson?

1228
01:25:56.277 --> 01:25:58.071
Open your mouth.

1229
01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:01.866
- What's that?
- This'll keep you from biting your tongue.

1230
01:26:01.866 --> 01:26:04.077
Now just bite down on it.

1231
01:26:04.369 --> 01:26:06.287
That's right. Just bite down.

1232
01:26:06.246 --> 01:26:08.248
Now, bite down on it.

1233
01:26:14.379 --> 01:26:16.089
Are you ready?

1234
01:26:18.758 --> 01:26:20.343
Here we go.

1235
01:26:50.748 --> 01:26:51.332
Here we go.

1236
01:26:51.374 --> 01:26:53.376
Now, one big breath.

1237
01:26:58.256 --> 01:26:59.757
Very good.

1238
01:27:03.261 --> 01:27:07.056
Gentlemen, I'd like to begin today.
It shouldn't take too long.

1239
01:27:08.975 --> 01:27:10.268
Jim?

1240
01:27:10.768 --> 01:27:12.061
It's been brought to my attention...

1241
01:27:12.061 --> 01:27:15.648
...that you've been giving Mr. Fredrickson
your medication.

1242
01:27:15.773 --> 01:27:17.484
Is that true?

1243
01:27:23.281 --> 01:27:24.782
No, ma'am.

1244
01:27:25.783 --> 01:27:27.076
Jim?

1245
01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:30.747
Are you giving your medication
to Mr. Fredrickson...

1246
01:27:30.788 --> 01:27:32.707
...or are you not?

1247
01:28:07.075 --> 01:28:10.662
How about it, you creeps,
you lunatics, mental defectives.

1248
01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:15.166
Let's hear it for Bullgoose Randall,
back in action. Nice shirt, Cheseroo.

1249
01:28:18.378 --> 01:28:20.296
Look at the faces on you!

1250
01:28:20.296 --> 01:28:21.881
Look at you!

1251
01:28:22.799 --> 01:28:25.510
The feeb's brigade, you ding-a-lings!

1252
01:28:26.469 --> 01:28:29.264
The mental defective league in formation.

1253
01:28:30.890 --> 01:28:34.102
How are you, Nurse Ratched?
I'm happy to be back.

1254
01:28:34.602 --> 01:28:37.105
We're happy to have you back, Randall.

1255
01:28:37.188 --> 01:28:38.690
Thank you.

1256
01:28:38.982 --> 01:28:42.902
Would you like to rest today,
or would you like to join the group?

1257
01:28:43.987 --> 01:28:46.406
I'd love to join the group...

1258
01:28:46.489 --> 01:28:47.782
I'd like...

1259
01:28:47.782 --> 01:28:50.493
I'm proud to join the group, Mildred.

1260
01:28:51.494 --> 01:28:53.496
How's it going, Mac?

1261
01:28:53.997 --> 01:28:55.915
Perfect, Billy Boy, absolutely perfect.

1262
01:28:55.874 --> 01:28:59.586
They were giving me 10,000 watts a day,
you know, and I'm...

1263
01:28:59.711 --> 01:29:01.004
...hot to trot.

1264
01:29:00.879 --> 01:29:03.965
The next woman who takes me on
will light up like a pinball machine...

1265
01:29:04.007 --> 01:29:06.509
...and pay off in silver dollars!

1266
01:29:10.305 --> 01:29:12.223
That's an amusing thought, Randall...

1267
01:29:12.182 --> 01:29:15.268
...but when you came in
we were talking to Jim.

1268
01:29:15.310 --> 01:29:18.104
He has a problem with his medication...

1269
01:29:18.396 --> 01:29:19.689
...and we'd like to get back to that.

1270
01:29:19.689 --> 01:29:23.193
Oh, I don't... I don't mind at all,
Nurse Ratched, I'm...

1271
01:29:24.110 --> 01:29:26.696
...as gentle as a puppy dog and...

1272
01:29:27.197 --> 01:29:29.407
Please proceed. Thank you.

1273
01:29:30.909 --> 01:29:33.411
The administration was hopeful,
but cautious Friday...

1274
01:29:33.411 --> 01:29:34.829
...in its reaction...

1275
01:29:34.787 --> 01:29:37.790
...in its reaction...

1276
01:29:34.787 --> 01:29:37.290
...to a possible opening of the Berlin Wall...

1277
01:29:37.290 --> 01:29:40.084
...during the upcoming Christmas holiday.

1278
01:29:41.085 --> 01:29:44.172
Good night, gentlemen.
See you in the morning.

1279
01:31:09.924 --> 01:31:11.843
Yeah, baby, it's Mac.

1280
01:31:11.801 --> 01:31:13.595
It's on tonight.

1281
01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:15.013
Don't worry about it.

1282
01:31:14.929 --> 01:31:17.432
Don't worry about it. Get a car.

1283
01:31:18.016 --> 01:31:21.311
I don't give a shit, baby.
Steal it if you have to!

1284
01:31:21.811 --> 01:31:23.897
I gotta go! I gotta go!

1285
01:31:24.314 --> 01:31:25.607
Don't forget to bring some booze.

1286
01:31:25.523 --> 01:31:26.816
Right.

1287
01:31:26.816 --> 01:31:28.109
Bye.

1288
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:24.249
Chief, I can't take it no more.

1289
01:32:25.625 --> 01:32:27.710
I gotta get out of here.

1290
01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:33.842
I can't. I just can't.

1291
01:32:35.635 --> 01:32:38.138
It's easier than you think, Chief.

1292
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:42.433
For you, maybe.
You're a lot bigger than me.

1293
01:32:45.019 --> 01:32:48.523
Why, Chief, you're about as big
as a goddamn tree trunk.

1294
01:32:54.445 --> 01:32:56.447
My poppa's real big.

1295
01:32:58.116 --> 01:33:00.201
He did like he pleased.

1296
01:33:00.618 --> 01:33:03.204
That's why everybody worked on him.

1297
01:33:06.249 --> 01:33:10.545
The last time I've seen my father
he was blind in the cedars from drinking.

1298
01:33:11.337 --> 01:33:14.424
And every time he put
the bottle to his mouth...

1299
01:33:14.424 --> 01:33:16.718
...he don't suck out of it.

1300
01:33:16.926 --> 01:33:19.846
It sucks out of him until he'd shrunk so...

1301
01:33:20.638 --> 01:33:24.058
...wrinkled and yellow,
even the dogs don't know him.

1302
01:33:25.018 --> 01:33:26.811
Killed him, huh?

1303
01:33:28.855 --> 01:33:31.274
I'm not saying they killed him.

1304
01:33:31.941 --> 01:33:35.445
They just worked on him,
the way they're working on you.

1305
01:33:44.454 --> 01:33:46.456
There they are, Chief.

1306
01:33:46.956 --> 01:33:49.250
There they are. They're here.

1307
01:34:03.848 --> 01:34:05.767
Over here. That's it!

1308
01:34:05.725 --> 01:34:07.644
McMurphy, stop all this Holy Roller shit...

1309
01:34:07.644 --> 01:34:10.939
...and get your ass back in bed.
Do you understand?

1310
01:34:13.233 --> 01:34:15.944
My prayers have been answered, Turkle.

1311
01:34:16.361 --> 01:34:18.154
Come on and see.

1312
01:34:26.329 --> 01:34:28.122
You'd take $20...

1313
01:34:28.832 --> 01:34:32.544
...to get down on your knees and pray,
wouldn't you, Turkle?

1314
01:34:33.253 --> 01:34:35.171
No, it don't send me, don't send me.

1315
01:34:35.130 --> 01:34:37.048
- It don't?
- Don't do nothing to me, no.

1316
01:34:37.048 --> 01:34:39.551
Well, you know there'll be more.

1317
01:34:41.344 --> 01:34:45.140
I mean, they'll be bringing
a couple of bottles with them, and...

1318
01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:48.852
You're getting closer, brother.
You're getting closer, but...

1319
01:34:49.561 --> 01:34:53.481
...they're going to be sharing
more than just bottles, ain't they?

1320
01:34:53.857 --> 01:34:55.775
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, sure.

1321
01:34:55.733 --> 01:34:57.652
- I know what you mean.
- Understand what I mean?

1322
01:34:57.652 --> 01:35:00.155
Yeah, I understand what you mean.

1323
01:35:00.738 --> 01:35:03.241
- Anything you say, Turkle.
- I'm on my knees, brother.

1324
01:35:03.241 --> 01:35:06.327
- I'm on my knees.
- Yeah, all right, all right.

1325
01:35:10.165 --> 01:35:13.251
- Let me just give them a hand here.
- I appreciate that.

1326
01:35:13.251 --> 01:35:14.961
- Hi.
- Ladies!

1327
01:35:15.170 --> 01:35:18.256
Oh, thank you. I believe this is
your department, Mr. Turkle.

1328
01:35:18.256 --> 01:35:20.758
- Hi, there! Give me a hand.
- How're you doing?

1329
01:35:20.758 --> 01:35:22.844
Love to give you a hand.

1330
01:35:23.970 --> 01:35:25.889
Keep it down. Keep it down.

1331
01:35:25.763 --> 01:35:28.266
- I split my pants.
- Keep it down!

1332
01:35:28.266 --> 01:35:31.978
- Give it to me. Give it all to me.
- You got to keep it down!

1333
01:35:34.564 --> 01:35:36.983
This looks like my high school.

1334
01:35:38.359 --> 01:35:40.361
Oh, hey, I take that.

1335
01:35:40.862 --> 01:35:42.780
- The barber chair.
- You may have it.

1336
01:35:42.655 --> 01:35:43.948
It is mine, mine.

1337
01:35:43.948 --> 01:35:46.743
You can have it. You can have it, honey.

1338
01:35:48.369 --> 01:35:52.290
- Take a load of these tubs.
- It's a real nice place you got here.

1339
01:35:53.374 --> 01:35:55.293
Hey, can I take a bath?

1340
01:35:55.168 --> 01:35:57.670
Sure, you can take a bath. Sure.

1341
01:35:58.379 --> 01:36:00.298
Just don't drown your pretty little self.

1342
01:36:00.173 --> 01:36:01.758
You know...

1343
01:36:02.050 --> 01:36:05.470
...Rose was married to a maniac once,
up in Beaverton.

1344
01:36:07.055 --> 01:36:08.848
Oh, really, miss?

1345
01:36:08.973 --> 01:36:10.266
What seemed to be the problem?

1346
01:36:10.266 --> 01:36:13.770
Oh, nothing, he used to put frogs
in my bra all the time.

1347
01:36:17.065 --> 01:36:18.858
Very interesting.

1348
01:36:18.983 --> 01:36:20.777
Very interesting.

1349
01:36:23.363 --> 01:36:27.158
Rose is very interested in hospitaIs,
and hospital facilities.

1350
01:36:27.075 --> 01:36:29.494
- I am?
-Yes. Oh, yes, you are.

1351
01:36:30.245 --> 01:36:32.163
- I'm going to take Miss Candy..
- Where you going?

1352
01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:34.582
I'm gonna take Candy for a stroll.

1353
01:36:34.582 --> 01:36:36.501
I got you, I got you.

1354
01:36:36.459 --> 01:36:40.463
- But just don't make too much noise.
- Oh, no, not a peep, not a peep.

1355
01:36:43.383 --> 01:36:46.469
Now, you come over here, baby,
right over here.

1356
01:36:49.681 --> 01:36:52.976
Don't worry about Candy, honey.
Sit down and relax.

1357
01:36:53.852 --> 01:36:57.147
Don't worry about Candy, honey.
Sit down and relax.

1358
01:37:05.155 --> 01:37:06.865
Wake up, boys.

1359
01:37:07.073 --> 01:37:08.575
Wake up.

1360
01:37:08.867 --> 01:37:10.869
It's medication time.

1361
01:37:12.078 --> 01:37:13.872
Medication time.

1362
01:37:14.581 --> 01:37:16.499
The nighttime spirits are here.

1363
01:37:16.374 --> 01:37:18.793
It's Randall to say goodbye...

1364
01:37:18.877 --> 01:37:22.088
...and get you high,
and nighttime angel, Candy.

1365
01:37:24.591 --> 01:37:27.886
That's right, Mr. Martini,
there is an Easter bunny.

1366
01:37:37.687 --> 01:37:39.606
Round the side, boys, join Mr. McMurphy...

1367
01:37:39.564 --> 01:37:42.150
...in the executive lounge, please.

1368
01:37:42.692 --> 01:37:44.486
Round the side.

1369
01:37:47.697 --> 01:37:49.908
It's going to be so great.

1370
01:37:50.992 --> 01:37:55.997
It's going to be so great.

1371
01:37:50.992 --> 01:37:51.576
You'd like a nip, Charles?

1372
01:37:51.576 --> 01:37:53.495
No trouble at all!

1373
01:37:54.078 --> 01:37:57.582
It's Billy the Club of the fabulous
and fantastic 14...

1374
01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:01.419
- What the hell's going on?
- Mr. Turkle...

1375
01:38:04.088 --> 01:38:05.381
Ain't this a bitch!

1376
01:38:05.381 --> 01:38:09.093
McMurphy, what're you trying to do?
Get my ass really fired?

1377
01:38:09.093 --> 01:38:12.096
Come on, get your ass out of here.
Come on.

1378
01:38:12.263 --> 01:38:13.556
We're just having a party.

1379
01:38:13.473 --> 01:38:17.060
Party, my ass! This ain't no nightclub,
this is a hospital!

1380
01:38:17.268 --> 01:38:21.481
Man, this is my fucking job!
I don't give a damn, this is my fucking job!

1381
01:38:22.899 --> 01:38:25.109
Oh, shit! The supervisor!

1382
01:38:25.401 --> 01:38:26.694
Get your asses back in there.

1383
01:38:26.694 --> 01:38:28.780
Come on. Come on there!

1384
01:38:29.197 --> 01:38:31.699
Where's that no-talking son of a bitch?
Is he in there?

1385
01:38:31.699 --> 01:38:33.409
Good. Come on.

1386
01:38:58.601 --> 01:39:00.186
Mr. Turkle?

1387
01:39:04.190 --> 01:39:05.775
Mr. Turkle?

1388
01:39:07.277 --> 01:39:10.280
Where the hell is he?
Why doesn't he answer?

1389
01:39:11.698 --> 01:39:13.616
He's jerking off somewhere.

1390
01:39:13.575 --> 01:39:16.077
Ain't nobody jerking off nowhere,
motherfucker!

1391
01:39:16.077 --> 01:39:19.164
Turkle, what the fuck are you doing here?
Go out and talk to her!

1392
01:39:19.205 --> 01:39:22.792
Doing the same fucking thing
you're doing in here, hiding!

1393
01:39:26.087 --> 01:39:27.672
Yes, ma'am?

1394
01:39:28.590 --> 01:39:30.508
Is everything all right, Mr. Turkle?

1395
01:39:30.508 --> 01:39:33.011
Oh, everything is just fine, ma'am.

1396
01:39:33.011 --> 01:39:35.013
Just fine. Just fine.

1397
01:39:44.189 --> 01:39:45.773
Who's there?

1398
01:39:46.107 --> 01:39:48.026
Ain't nobody in there.

1399
01:39:47.984 --> 01:39:49.986
Please open that door.

1400
01:39:56.701 --> 01:39:58.203
I'm sorry.

1401
01:40:02.415 --> 01:40:04.501
I'm sorry, ma'am, but...

1402
01:40:04.918 --> 01:40:08.213
...you know, a man gets
awfully lonesome at night.

1403
01:40:08.588 --> 01:40:11.090
You understand what I mean, don't you?

1404
01:40:11.090 --> 01:40:13.593
You understand? I'm sure you understand.

1405
01:40:13.593 --> 01:40:16.596
I want that woman off this ward,
immediately.

1406
01:40:18.598 --> 01:40:19.891
Yes, ma'am.

1407
01:40:19.891 --> 01:40:21.476
Yes, ma'am.

1408
01:40:41.788 --> 01:40:43.706
- Jesus!
- Mr. Turkle, is she gone?

1409
01:40:43.623 --> 01:40:45.542
Shit! Yes, she's gone, and so am l...

1410
01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:48.002
...so get your behinds out of here
and go to bed.

1411
01:40:48.002 --> 01:40:50.505
Go ahead, move it, move it! Move it!

1412
01:40:50.505 --> 01:40:52.423
- I knew we were in trouble!
- Let's go!

1413
01:40:52.423 --> 01:40:55.510
You and your teddy bear ass!
Move them on out of here!

1414
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:56.803
Come on, come on!

1415
01:40:56.803 --> 01:40:58.721
- Candy?
- Come on, Candy!

1416
01:40:58.721 --> 01:41:00.431
Jesus Christ!

1417
01:41:01.224 --> 01:41:03.143
Mr. Turkle, I'm really sorry.

1418
01:41:03.017 --> 01:41:05.520
Tell those fucking friends of mine
to get out!

1419
01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:07.438
- Get out!
- I'm really sorry.

1420
01:41:07.397 --> 01:41:08.690
What are you..?

1421
01:41:08.731 --> 01:41:10.650
What the fuck..? Get out of here!

1422
01:41:10.525 --> 01:41:14.320
Please get out, this is my job!
You're fucking it up! You understand?

1423
01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:15.822
Get out!

1424
01:41:16.197 --> 01:41:18.992
Get out of here, you slim motherfucker!

1425
01:41:20.618 --> 01:41:22.120
Fuck it!

1426
01:41:23.705 --> 01:41:24.789
Fuck it!

1427
01:41:24.831 --> 01:41:26.332
Fuck it!

1428
01:41:35.425 --> 01:41:38.720
Good night, good night,
don't Iet the cooties bite.

1429
01:42:06.706 --> 01:42:09.209
Right out of the shock department.
I got it from...

1430
01:42:09.209 --> 01:42:11.127
I got it from Ratched's charts.

1431
01:42:11.127 --> 01:42:13.630
Right. There you go, there you go.
Easy now.

1432
01:42:13.630 --> 01:42:15.548
Don't take it all at once!

1433
01:42:15.507 --> 01:42:18.426
Let's try a little over here. There you go.

1434
01:44:03.740 --> 01:44:05.241
Let's go.

1435
01:44:10.622 --> 01:44:13.041
I'll have to be the one, Chief.

1436
01:44:30.058 --> 01:44:32.268
Hey, Mac, what's going on?

1437
01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:33.853
Well, Dale...

1438
01:44:33.728 --> 01:44:36.439
...Lord Randall is stepping down one.

1439
01:44:36.856 --> 01:44:38.441
Fredrickson.

1440
01:44:40.652 --> 01:44:42.070
Jimmy.

1441
01:44:42.529 --> 01:44:44.447
Aren't you gonna say goodbye to me, Mac?

1442
01:44:44.364 --> 01:44:47.367
Sure, I'm gonna say
goodbye to you, Charles.

1443
01:44:50.036 --> 01:44:51.830
Thank you, Mac.

1444
01:44:51.955 --> 01:44:53.456
Thank you.

1445
01:44:53.748 --> 01:44:55.750
I'll never forget you.

1446
01:44:55.834 --> 01:44:58.837
I'll never forget you.

1447
01:44:55.834 --> 01:44:58.336
Settle down, Charles, all right.

1448
01:45:00.255 --> 01:45:02.465
Hey, Billy, what's wrong?

1449
01:45:03.967 --> 01:45:06.177
Billy, for Christ's sake?

1450
01:45:09.639 --> 01:45:11.558
What's the matter?

1451
01:45:15.270 --> 01:45:17.480
I'm gonna miss you very...

1452
01:45:18.356 --> 01:45:20.441
...very, very much, Mac.

1453
01:45:24.070 --> 01:45:26.573
Why don't you come with us, then?

1454
01:45:28.366 --> 01:45:30.285
Think I don't want to?

1455
01:45:30.243 --> 01:45:32.537
Well, come on then, let's go.

1456
01:45:32.745 --> 01:45:34.956
Well, it's not that easy.

1457
01:45:39.043 --> 01:45:40.962
I'm not ready yet.

1458
01:45:45.258 --> 01:45:46.551
Tell you what we'll do...

1459
01:45:46.551 --> 01:45:49.053
When I get to Canada,
I'll write you a postcard...

1460
01:45:49.053 --> 01:45:51.556
...and I'll put my address on it.

1461
01:45:51.556 --> 01:45:54.058
That way when you're ready, you'll...

1462
01:45:54.058 --> 01:45:55.351
...you'll know where to go.

1463
01:45:55.268 --> 01:45:57.061
What do you say?

1464
01:46:04.652 --> 01:46:06.654
Is she going with you?

1465
01:46:12.869 --> 01:46:14.287
Candy?

1466
01:46:16.581 --> 01:46:20.376
Yeah, she'll be there when you get there.
She's going with us.

1467
01:46:21.544 --> 01:46:23.838
Are you going to marry her?

1468
01:46:25.965 --> 01:46:28.259
No, we're just good friends.

1469
01:46:29.677 --> 01:46:30.970
Why?

1470
01:46:37.852 --> 01:46:39.354
Nothing.

1471
01:46:40.355 --> 01:46:43.358
Don't "nothing" me, all right? What is it?

1472
01:46:54.077 --> 01:46:55.787
It's too late.

1473
01:46:59.082 --> 01:47:01.376
Do you want a date with her?

1474
01:47:02.877 --> 01:47:06.381
Jesus, I must be crazy
to be in a looney bin like this!

1475
01:47:08.466 --> 01:47:09.968
Date, huh?

1476
01:47:10.385 --> 01:47:13.888
Well, it'll have to be a fast date,
I'll tell you that.

1477
01:47:16.683 --> 01:47:18.184
Not now!

1478
01:47:18.476 --> 01:47:19.978
Not now?

1479
01:47:20.353 --> 01:47:21.938
When, then?

1480
01:47:29.779 --> 01:47:32.073
When I have a free weekend.

1481
01:47:32.282 --> 01:47:34.200
You're busy right now, are you?

1482
01:47:34.159 --> 01:47:36.661
You've got something to do right now?

1483
01:47:36.661 --> 01:47:37.954
- You've got something to do?
- No.

1484
01:47:37.871 --> 01:47:41.458
Good, then don't talk to me about
when you're ready. Yeah.

1485
01:47:41.666 --> 01:47:43.585
- Ready and everything like that.
- No.

1486
01:47:43.585 --> 01:47:45.795
Candy, come here a minute.

1487
01:47:46.671 --> 01:47:49.174
Candy, I want you to meet
the famous Billy.

1488
01:47:49.174 --> 01:47:51.092
Go get him, will you?

1489
01:47:51.092 --> 01:47:53.595
Go get him. Get him out of there.

1490
01:47:54.179 --> 01:47:56.890
I want you to get a hold of Billy...

1491
01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:01.102
All you gotta do is this one little thing.

1492
01:48:01.060 --> 01:48:03.563
- The kid's cute, isn't he?
- Yeah.

1493
01:48:08.568 --> 01:48:10.862
Think of me the whole time.

1494
01:48:11.696 --> 01:48:13.281
There he is.

1495
01:48:13.573 --> 01:48:15.366
Billy the Club!

1496
01:48:21.664 --> 01:48:23.249
I got $25...

1497
01:48:24.167 --> 01:48:27.462
...that says you are going to burn
this woman down!

1498
01:48:34.177 --> 01:48:35.887
Candy, baby...

1499
01:48:40.475 --> 01:48:42.185
...I love ya.

1500
01:48:42.393 --> 01:48:44.187
Hurl the ringer.

1501
01:48:48.608 --> 01:48:50.527
Take it easy! Back!

1502
01:48:53.571 --> 01:48:56.074
No, no, I'll show you some card tricks.

1503
01:48:56.074 --> 01:48:57.992
You ain't seen the Spanish deck yet.

1504
01:48:57.992 --> 01:49:00.411
That's 40 percent more torture.

1505
01:49:03.581 --> 01:49:07.502
I'm going to present you
with this fine deck of cards for playing.

1506
01:49:11.798 --> 01:49:15.301
This ain't gonna take long, Rose,
you know what I mean?

1507
01:49:24.894 --> 01:49:27.105
When we get to Canada...

1508
01:50:40.011 --> 01:50:42.222
When we get to Canada...

1509
01:51:13.795 --> 01:51:15.713
Out of sight, man!

1510
01:51:16.297 --> 01:51:18.007
Out of sight!

1511
01:51:35.024 --> 01:51:37.443
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1512
01:51:41.322 --> 01:51:42.615
Mr. Warren...

1513
01:51:42.532 --> 01:51:45.034
...close the window, and lock the screen.

1514
01:51:45.034 --> 01:51:46.452
Right.

1515
01:52:11.311 --> 01:52:14.397
Mr. Miller, show this woman
the way out of the hospital.

1516
01:52:14.439 --> 01:52:15.857
Gladly.

1517
01:52:17.609 --> 01:52:19.527
Come on, lady, let's go.

1518
01:52:19.527 --> 01:52:20.820
-You're going home.
- Where?

1519
01:52:20.737 --> 01:52:22.655
Let her go, Scanlon.

1520
01:52:22.614 --> 01:52:23.198
You're going home.

1521
01:52:23.239 --> 01:52:25.158
- Mr. Washington?
- Yes, Miss Ratched.

1522
01:52:25.116 --> 01:52:27.035
Make sure no one is missing.

1523
01:52:27.035 --> 01:52:28.536
Will do.

1524
01:52:29.537 --> 01:52:31.456
- Mac?
-Come on, Scanlon, let's move.

1525
01:52:31.331 --> 01:52:33.249
Everybody out of here!
Come on, move it out!

1526
01:52:33.208 --> 01:52:34.501
Come on, move it!

1527
01:52:34.542 --> 01:52:37.045
Martini, get your butt up! Come on, up!

1528
01:52:37.045 --> 01:52:38.963
All right, Colonel,
get your dead ass up there!

1529
01:52:38.838 --> 01:52:42.050
What the hell's going on here?
Come on, move out!

1530
01:52:50.141 --> 01:52:51.851
Miss Ratched?

1531
01:52:55.146 --> 01:52:56.439
Fredrickson, what are you doing?

1532
01:52:56.439 --> 01:52:58.358
Where you going? Back out here!

1533
01:52:58.233 --> 01:53:00.527
Let's go! Come on, move it!

1534
01:53:02.612 --> 01:53:03.905
Taber, get up. Come on.

1535
01:53:03.947 --> 01:53:05.740
I said, get up!

1536
01:53:08.952 --> 01:53:10.870
All right, move it back there! McMurphy...

1537
01:53:10.745 --> 01:53:14.165
...get your ass over here,
and bring Dracula with you.

1538
01:53:16.543 --> 01:53:17.836
...get your ass over here,
and bring Dracula with you.

1539
01:53:17.752 --> 01:53:19.963
Stay right there, Bancini!

1540
01:53:20.839 --> 01:53:22.757
- Miss Ratched?
- Yes.

1541
01:53:22.715 --> 01:53:25.218
It looks like Billy Bibbit's
the only one missing.

1542
01:53:25.218 --> 01:53:26.636
Billy?

1543
01:53:27.137 --> 01:53:29.722
- Thank you, Mr. Washington.
- Okay.

1544
01:53:30.849 --> 01:53:34.644
Did Billy Bibbit leave the grounds
of the hospital, gentlemen?

1545
01:53:39.023 --> 01:53:41.526
I want an answer to my question!

1546
01:53:42.152 --> 01:53:44.946
Did he leave the grounds of the hospital?

1547
01:53:57.750 --> 01:53:59.669
- Mr. Washington?
- Yes.

1548
01:53:59.627 --> 01:54:02.130
Miss Pilbow, check all the rooms.

1549
01:54:02.755 --> 01:54:04.048
- Mr. Warren?
- Yes.

1550
01:54:04.048 --> 01:54:06.342
You start with the tub room.

1551
01:54:13.433 --> 01:54:15.018
Mr. Martini?

1552
01:54:15.935 --> 01:54:18.146
May I have my cap, please?

1553
01:54:18.438 --> 01:54:19.856
My cap!

1554
01:54:20.356 --> 01:54:21.649
My cap!

1555
01:54:21.524 --> 01:54:22.942
There.

1556
01:54:27.155 --> 01:54:28.656
Thank you.

1557
01:54:54.057 --> 01:54:55.767
Miss Ratched.

1558
01:55:46.067 --> 01:55:48.278
I can explain everything.

1559
01:55:49.154 --> 01:55:50.947
Please do, Billy.

1560
01:55:51.072 --> 01:55:52.991
Explain everything.

1561
01:55:56.661 --> 01:55:58.246
Everything?

1562
01:56:00.373 --> 01:56:02.292
Aren't you ashamed?

1563
01:56:04.752 --> 01:56:06.337
No, I'm not.

1564
01:56:16.681 --> 01:56:19.184
You know, Billy, what worries me is...

1565
01:56:19.184 --> 01:56:21.978
...how your mother's going to take this.

1566
01:56:31.654 --> 01:56:33.239
Well, you...

1567
01:56:34.157 --> 01:56:36.075
...don't have to...

1568
01:56:36.659 --> 01:56:38.870
...tell her, Miss Ratched.

1569
01:56:39.871 --> 01:56:42.081
I don't have to tell her?

1570
01:56:42.957 --> 01:56:46.169
Your mother and I are old friends,
you know that.

1571
01:56:55.470 --> 01:56:56.971
Please...

1572
01:56:57.972 --> 01:56:59.557
...don't...

1573
01:56:59.891 --> 01:57:01.184
...tell my mother.

1574
01:57:01.059 --> 01:57:04.854
Don't you think you should've thought
of that before you took that woman...

1575
01:57:04.854 --> 01:57:06.648
...in that room?

1576
01:57:14.864 --> 01:57:16.282
No, no.

1577
01:57:22.372 --> 01:57:23.665
I didn't.

1578
01:57:23.581 --> 01:57:26.584
You mean, she dragged you
in there by force?

1579
01:57:40.473 --> 01:57:41.975
She did.

1580
01:57:46.187 --> 01:57:47.897
Everybody did.

1581
01:57:48.690 --> 01:57:50.608
Everybody? Who did?

1582
01:57:51.776 --> 01:57:53.778
You tell me who did!

1583
01:58:13.673 --> 01:58:15.175
McMurphy.

1584
01:58:19.304 --> 01:58:21.097
Miss Ratched...

1585
01:58:23.099 --> 01:58:23.683
...please don't...

1586
01:58:23.683 --> 01:58:26.478
- Mr. Warren?
- ...tell my mother, please.

1587
01:58:26.769 --> 01:58:29.272
Would you see that the men
are washed and ready for the day.

1588
01:58:29.272 --> 01:58:31.774
Miss Ratched, please...please...

1589
01:58:34.277 --> 01:58:35.570
- Mr. Washington?
- Yes?

1590
01:58:35.570 --> 01:58:38.364
- Put Billy in Dr. Spivey's office.
- No.

1591
01:58:38.698 --> 01:58:41.409
Stay with him till the doctor arrives.

1592
01:58:46.206 --> 01:58:48.708
Move it! Come on, Martini, get on!

1593
01:59:02.806 --> 01:59:05.308
Move it! Come on, Martini, get on!

1594
01:59:12.106 --> 01:59:14.901
Hey, that way, please. Please, gentlemen.

1595
01:59:15.902 --> 01:59:18.404
Let's go, come on.
Come on, you guys. What is this?

1596
01:59:18.404 --> 01:59:19.906
Let's go.

1597
01:59:43.388 --> 01:59:45.682
Hey, what the hell is that?

1598
01:59:45.890 --> 01:59:48.601
McMurphy, what the hell are you doing?

1599
01:59:53.398 --> 01:59:56.401
Washington, to the day room!!
Immediately!!

1600
02:00:07.203 --> 02:00:09.998
Put down those keys and nobody gets hurt.

1601
02:00:19.716 --> 02:00:23.428
Move away from the window
and take that damn Chief with you.

1602
02:00:34.689 --> 02:00:36.608
Come on, let's go!

1603
02:00:45.325 --> 02:00:47.118
Let me through!

1604
02:00:47.202 --> 02:00:48.995
Let me through!

1605
02:00:59.714 --> 02:01:01.925
Out of the way, McMurphy!

1606
02:01:04.719 --> 02:01:06.012
Come on, clear it!

1607
02:01:06.012 --> 02:01:08.306
Get these people out of here!

1608
02:01:08.515 --> 02:01:09.808
Oh, Billy!

1609
02:01:09.724 --> 02:01:11.017
Will you guys clear the door?

1610
02:01:11.017 --> 02:01:13.520
Everybody out! Out! Everybody out!

1611
02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:15.522
Come on, goddamn it!

1612
02:01:18.525 --> 02:01:20.235
Now calm down!

1613
02:01:21.027 --> 02:01:24.113
The best thing we can do is
go on with our daily routine.

1614
02:01:24.113 --> 02:01:25.615
All right?

1615
02:01:32.914 --> 02:01:34.499
Don't! Mac!

1616
02:01:38.503 --> 02:01:40.004
Mac! No!

1617
02:02:11.619 --> 02:02:13.121
Mac! No!

1618
02:02:19.836 --> 02:02:21.754
And the bets are placed.

1619
02:02:21.629 --> 02:02:24.716
There's one for Tabes, and Chessy,
and Martini, and the dealer.

1620
02:02:24.841 --> 02:02:27.343
And a four to Tabes, and a six, and a nine...

1621
02:02:27.343 --> 02:02:29.637
...and a ten to the dealer.

1622
02:02:29.846 --> 02:02:31.139
A nine?

1623
02:02:31.014 --> 02:02:33.099
What do you say, Tabes?

1624
02:02:33.516 --> 02:02:35.310
A dime a piece.

1625
02:02:35.435 --> 02:02:37.145
No? You stick.

1626
02:02:37.312 --> 02:02:39.898
- He sticks.
- He sticks with a four.

1627
02:02:41.733 --> 02:02:43.651
Chessy's going for the ride.

1628
02:02:43.526 --> 02:02:45.445
What does that mean?

1629
02:02:45.445 --> 02:02:47.363
He wants a hit. Yeah, and a big queen.

1630
02:02:47.322 --> 02:02:48.615
I think you're busted.

1631
02:02:48.531 --> 02:02:50.450
Buggered, not busted.

1632
02:02:50.408 --> 02:02:51.701
- Turn them over.
- Buggered.

1633
02:02:51.743 --> 02:02:53.244
And weep.

1634
02:02:53.536 --> 02:02:54.954
Hit me.

1635
02:02:55.413 --> 02:02:57.332
I think you're over.

1636
02:02:57.332 --> 02:02:59.250
- I know you're over.
- Hovno.

1637
02:02:59.250 --> 02:03:01.252
That's a three. Hovno.

1638
02:03:12.931 --> 02:03:14.516
Mr. Sefelt?

1639
02:03:16.142 --> 02:03:18.228
Did everything go well?

1640
02:03:20.438 --> 02:03:22.232
That's very nice.

1641
02:03:22.315 --> 02:03:24.734
Now you feeI better, don't you?

1642
02:03:24.818 --> 02:03:26.402
Yes, ma'am.

1643
02:03:27.946 --> 02:03:29.864
Deuce to the dealer.

1644
02:03:29.823 --> 02:03:31.741
Split them. Higher.

1645
02:03:32.951 --> 02:03:34.744
McMurphy is out.

1646
02:03:39.249 --> 02:03:41.251
McMurphy has escaped.

1647
02:03:42.335 --> 02:03:44.254
They were taking him through the tunnel.

1648
02:03:44.254 --> 02:03:47.257
He beat up two of the attendants
and escaped.

1649
02:03:47.340 --> 02:03:49.259
McMurphy's upstairs.

1650
02:03:49.259 --> 02:03:51.052
Oh, no, no, no!

1651
02:03:51.136 --> 02:03:53.638
Jim, I'm telling you,
McMurphy is upstairs...

1652
02:03:53.638 --> 02:03:55.557
...and he's as meek as a lamb.

1653
02:03:55.557 --> 02:03:56.850
Really?

1654
02:03:56.724 --> 02:03:58.810
I mean, how do you know?

1655
02:03:59.227 --> 02:04:01.229
Jack Dunphy told me.

1656
02:04:01.729 --> 02:04:03.648
Jack Dunphy's full of shit!

1657
02:04:03.648 --> 02:04:05.358
Right! Right!

1658
02:04:13.324 --> 02:04:15.034
Right! Right!

1659
02:05:58.471 --> 02:06:00.473
They said you escaped.

1660
02:06:02.142 --> 02:06:04.060
I knew you wouldn't Ieave without me.

1661
02:06:04.060 --> 02:06:06.062
I was waiting for you.

1662
02:06:07.147 --> 02:06:09.065
Now we can make it, Mac.

1663
02:06:09.065 --> 02:06:11.484
I feel big as a damn mountain.

1664
02:06:30.378 --> 02:06:31.796
Oh, no!

1665
02:07:02.869 --> 02:07:05.288
I'm not going without you, Mac.

1666
02:07:07.874 --> 02:07:10.460
I wouldn't Ieave you here this way.

1667
02:07:20.386 --> 02:07:22.388
You're coming with me.

1668
02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:45.662
Let's go!

1669
02:09:04.908 --> 02:09:06.409
Let's go!
