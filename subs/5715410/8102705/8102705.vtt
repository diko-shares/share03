be there when you needed me.

your engine and step out of the vehicle.

the ends of my shoes?

really out of control.</i>

00:45:55.011 --> 00:45:57.876
<i>We couldn't go anywhere
without being followed.</i>

888
00:45:57.878 --> 00:46:02.010
I knew the only way to keep
you safe was to disappear.

889
00:46:02.012 --> 00:46:05.544
Why didn't they come after me?
Don't we have the same, uh...

890
00:46:05.546 --> 00:46:08.811
DNA. Yes, we do, but when you were younger,

891
00:46:08.813 --> 00:46:11.710
the genetic mutation hadn't activated yet.

892
00:46:11.712 --> 00:46:16.012
I'm sure they found some of your genetic
material when they ransacked the house.

893
00:46:16.014 --> 00:46:18.877
But back then, you'd have
seemed totally normal.

894
00:46:18.879 --> 00:46:20.479
That must be why they left us alone.

895
00:46:20.481 --> 00:46:23.145
And it's the reason I can't come back.

896
00:46:23.147 --> 00:46:25.979
It's too dangerous. If
they even suspect I'm alive,

897
00:46:25.981 --> 00:46:28.148
they'll stop at nothing
to get what they want.

I jest. Please sit, Mrs. Harrison,

903
00:46:41.082 --> 00:46:44.848

You expect me to believe
you're here because of my son?

906
00:46:49.483 --> 00:46:50.949
Oh, you got me.

907
00:46:50.951 --> 00:46:52.915
I don't care about your son,

908
00:46:52.917 --> 00:46:56.218
but if we find him, we find your husband.

909
00:46:56.982 --> 00:46:58.649
My husband?

910
00:46:58.651 --> 00:47:00.716
He died a long time ago. You know that.

911
00:47:00.718 --> 00:47:02.616
Yes, well... No.

912
00:47:02.618 --> 00:47:06.352
Some new evidence has come to my

Bigfoot? Really?

916
00:47:17.052 --> 00:47:22.116
Before he disappeared, your husband
was working on strange experiments.

917
00:47:22.118 --> 00:47:26.485
Studying hair growth.
Hair like we've never seen.

918
00:47:26.487 --> 00:47:29.354
Hair like that of say, a bigfoot.

919
00:47:30.954 --> 00:47:33.851
Quite a coincidence, wouldn't you say?

920
00:47:33.853 --> 00:47:39.619
Your son happens to show up at the
first Bigfoot sighting in 10 years?

921
00:47:39.621 --> 00:47:42.620
I don't think your husband
was studying Bigfoot.

922
00:47:42.622 --> 00:47:45.088
I think he is Bigfoot.

these black cars doing here?

Oh, no.

00:48:16.457 --> 00:48:19.022

Well, it is. And tastes good too.

941
00:48:40.925 --> 00:48:42.525
I'm afraid not.

942
00:48:42.527 --> 00:48:45.158
You kind of have to be
a vegetarian out here.

943
00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:48.524
You eat one of those guys and
everyone starts asking questions.

but nobody cares that he's delicious.

948
00:48:58.159 --> 00:48:59.391
I am trying to tell them, you know,

949
00:48:59.393 --> 00:49:01.825
a little salt and pepper
on the old Trapper,

950
00:49:01.827 --> 00:49:04.460
it's so good. They don't want to hear it.

You have to admit,

956
00:49:13.861 --> 00:49:15.327
it's better than Mom's meatloaf.

957
00:49:15.329 --> 00:49:18.394
I'll give you that. What
is in that stuff anyway?

958

00:55:26.659 --> 00:55:29.825
All right, then. Take
care of yourself, kid.

1061
00:55:29.827 --> 00:55:31.825
Wait, where are you going?

1062
00:55:31.827 --> 00:55:34.225
To find a new place to start over.

1063
00:55:34.227 --> 00:55:35.424
You're just going to leave?

1064
00:55:35.426 --> 00:55:37.357
Well, not much left here for us, is there?

1065
00:55:37.359 --> 00:55:38.360
Way to go, man.

1066
00:55:44.327 --> 00:55:46.062
Hey! Wait.

1067
00:55:47.228 --> 00:55:48.658
Stop.

1068
00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:49.728
(GRUNTS)

1069
00:55:50.727 --> 00:55:52.625
Hey, I said stop!

1070

(ROARS)

1071
00:55:54.695 --> 00:55:56.095
(YELLS)

1072
00:55:56.729 --> 00:55:58.127
Huh?

1073
00:55:58.129 --> 00:56:00.060
If you're going to bite my head off, do it.

1074
00:56:00.062 --> 00:56:01.828
Otherwise, I've got something to say.

1075
00:56:04.294 --> 00:56:07.028
I've got a plan but I need your help.

1076
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:09.362
It's your problem, not ours.

1077
00:56:10.997 --> 00:56:13.827
This isn't about me, it's about my dad.

1078
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:16.728
I made the mistake, he
shouldn't have to pay for it.

1079
00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:20.163
So you want us to bail you out now? Nice.

1080
00:56:20.165 --> 00:56:22.029
I didn't mean for this to happen.

1081
00:56:22.031 --> 00:56:25.327
I just came out here to
find my family. I'm sorry.

1082
00:56:25.329 --> 00:56:28.162
Sorry isn't going to
unburn down our forest!

1083
00:56:28.164 --> 00:56:32.163
If I could take it back,
I would. But I can't.

1084
00:56:32.165 --> 00:56:34.495
Please, guys, I need your help.

1085
00:56:34.497 --> 00:56:36.928
When animals go up against humans,

1086
00:56:36.930 --> 00:56:38.828
humans always win.

1087
00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:41.897
I'm not gonna end up a bearskin rug.

1088
00:56:41.899 --> 00:56:44.564
What would Bigfoot do
if you were in trouble?

1089
00:56:44.566 --> 00:56:46.197
Would he just walk away?

1090
00:56:46.199 --> 00:56:48.730
Sometimes doing the right thing is hard.

1091
00:56:48.732 --> 00:56:51.796
I'm not going to tell
you it won't be dangerous.

1092
00:56:51.798 --> 00:56:54.665
But the only way we stand a
chance is if we work together.

1093
00:56:54.667 --> 00:56:57.534
Please, Bigfoot needs your help.

1094
00:56:59.201 --> 00:57:02.563
The kid's right. Bigfoot needs us.

1095
00:57:02.565 --> 00:57:05.200
I agree with them, I'm in.

1096
00:57:05.201 --> 00:57:07.731
All right then, we're in.

1097
00:57:07.733 --> 00:57:10.565
Whoa, wait, we're not
even going to discuss it?

1098
00:57:10.567 --> 00:57:14.866
Uh, I was going to say "in"
too, you just said it first.

1099
00:57:14.868 --> 00:57:16.867
What do you say, Wilbur?

1100
00:57:19.367 --> 00:57:21.200
Hmm, okay.

1101
00:57:21.202 --> 00:57:23.136
Let's do it for Bigfoot.

1102
00:57:40.269 --> 00:57:42.835
EASTMAN: (LAUGHING) I
could watch that all day.

1103
00:57:42.837 --> 00:57:44.634
It's incredible.

1104
00:57:44.636 --> 00:57:48.534
The structure of the hair is
different at the molecular level.

1105
00:57:48.536 --> 00:57:49.837
(BIGFOOT YAWNS)

1106
00:57:50.871 --> 00:57:53.236
Oh. Oh! It's awake.

1107
00:57:53.238 --> 00:57:55.970
Ah, good morning, my dear beast.

1108
00:57:55.972 --> 00:57:59.803
Or should I say... Doctor Harrison?

1109
00:57:59.805 --> 00:58:01.736
(GRUNTING) Let me go!

1110
00:58:01.738 --> 00:58:03.339
Ah, ah, ah. Calm down.

1111
00:58:03.904 --> 00:58:05.606
(GRUNTING)

1112
00:58:06.672 --> 00:58:08.204
Or not.

1113
00:58:08.206 --> 00:58:09.440
Get back!

1114
00:58:11.372 --> 00:58:13.536
Oh, no, no, no. There's no need for that.

1115
00:58:13.538 --> 00:58:17.237
Do you have any idea what that thing costs?

1116
00:58:17.239 --> 00:58:19.904
(SCOFFS) I'm sure we've got another one.

1117
00:58:19.906 --> 00:58:23.237
Ah, the benefits of being rich.

1118
00:58:23.239 --> 00:58:26.773
This thing here, I have no idea what it is.

1119
00:58:29.841 --> 00:58:32.405
But we'll replace it too.

1120
00:58:32.407 --> 00:58:35.873
The only thing of value
here is our new friend.

1121
00:58:35.875 --> 00:58:38.072
You'll never get what you want from me.

1122
00:58:38.074 --> 00:58:40.906
I'll fight you every step of the way.

1123
00:58:40.908 --> 00:58:43.075
(LAUGHS) No, you won't.

1124
00:58:43.077 --> 00:58:44.874
You want to know how I know?

1125
00:58:44.876 --> 00:58:46.876
Your family is still out there.

1126
00:58:47.942 --> 00:58:49.708
(GRUNTS) Leave them out of this.

1127
00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:51.673
Happily. I have no use for them.

1128
00:58:51.675 --> 00:58:54.042
But if you make life hard for us,

1129
00:58:54.044 --> 00:58:56.908
we can make life very hard for them.

1130
00:58:56.910 --> 00:59:00.308
- That said, if you cooperate...
- (GRUNTING)

1131
00:59:00.310 --> 00:59:03.508
I promise to take good care of your family.

1132
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:06.511
So, Mr. Bigfoot, what will it be?

1133
00:59:07.678 --> 00:59:08.945
(GRUNTING)

1134
00:59:13.044 --> 00:59:15.508
Well, guys, it looks like we're
going to have to hitch a ride.

1135
00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:16.576
Got it.

00:59:19.145 --> 00:59:21.543
- What?
- More of a covert ride.

1138
00:59:21.545 --> 00:59:24.344
Got it.

1139
00:59:24.346 --> 00:59:27.910
Okay, we'll wait for the last
trailer in the convoy. Everyone ready?

1140
00:59:27.912 --> 00:59:29.209
I was born ready.

1141
00:59:29.211 --> 00:59:31.010
Actually, I was born a few weeks early.

1142
00:59:31.012 --> 00:59:32.444
I needed a lot of help to get started...

1143

- Shut up.
- Will you shut up?

1144
00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:35.376
- Shut up.
- STEVE: Yeah.

1145
00:59:35.378 --> 00:59:36.544

Why you don't y'all go check it out?

go? I'm covered in latte!

1161
01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:26.550
(SIGHS) Fine. Let's both go.

01:00:29.918 --> 01:00:31.015
Hmm.

1163
01:00:31.017 --> 01:00:33.252
All right, let's roll.

1164
01:00:39.951 --> 01:00:43.283
Hang on tight, guys. This
is going to be a long ride.

So what are you waiting for?

1172
01:01:04.385 --> 01:01:07.252
This needs to be tested immediately.

01:01:07.254 --> 01:01:08.888

How do we get out of here?

I need you to believe that.

You've been a naughty, naughty boy, Adam.

1313
01:09:24.061 --> 01:09:26.759
It's very lucky your
father is a friend of mine,

I'm staying here. You and your
mother are going to be safe.

It's better this way.

He's sick. You're killing him!

I could take the rings off my tail

like a fancy magician.

1338
01:10:40.033 --> 01:10:41.765
(SLURRING) I could be your assistant.

1339

half, quarters, pennies,

01:13:52.649 --> 01:13:54.381
It's up to you.

1407
01:13:54.383 --> 01:13:57.651
But I need my dad, and I'm
not leaving here without you.

1409
01:14:00.983 --> 01:14:03.617
You are one stubborn kid.

1410
01:14:05.584 --> 01:14:08.384
(CHUCKLES) I guess I take after my old man.

1411
01:14:12.351 --> 01:14:15.516
Where's Adam? You said
he was right behind us.

1412
01:14:15.518 --> 01:14:17.849
What have you done with my son?

1413
01:14:17.851 --> 01:14:19.949
Calm down, he's on the way.

1414
01:14:19.951 --> 01:14:21.518
As soon as he gets home,
we'll be out of your hair.

1415
01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:24.316
As soon as you leave, I'm calling the cops.

1416
01:14:24.318 --> 01:14:26.617
(LAUGHS) What are you gonna say?

1417
01:14:26.619 --> 01:14:29.051
"Hello, police? My husband is Bigfoot,

1418
01:14:29.053 --> 01:14:31.118
"and he's been captured
in an evil conspiracy."

1419
01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:33.384
Sounds pretty crazy to me.

1420
01:14:33.386 --> 01:14:35.651
You know, someone with a story like that

1421
01:14:35.653 --> 01:14:37.785
probably isn't fit to raise a kid.

1422
01:14:37.787 --> 01:14:40.551
How dare you. You should
be ashamed of yourself.

1423
01:14:40.553 --> 01:14:43.217
Listen, lady, we're just doing our jobs.

1424

(SCOFFS)

1425
01:14:44.653 --> 01:14:47.553
Now where's the can? You
got a bathroom in this place?

1426
01:14:47.555 --> 01:14:49.955
No, we go in the bushes outside.

1427
01:14:51.121 --> 01:14:52.622
It's upstairs.

1428
01:14:59.621 --> 01:15:02.454
GARCIA: Simpson! Come into
the bathroom, right now!

1429
01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:06.152
Uh... That's okay, I'll
wait until you're done.

1430
01:15:06.154 --> 01:15:07.855
Would you get in here?

1431
01:15:10.089 --> 01:15:11.823
What's going on?

1432
01:15:15.422 --> 01:15:17.088
Sir, we're at the house.

1433
01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:19.653
The boy's a bigfoot. We've
got the hair to prove it.

EASTMAN: (EXCITEDLY) <i>What?
Fantastic! Change of plan, then.</i>

01:15:34.525 --> 01:15:38.623
That's not very nice. Do you
treat all your guests like this?

1438
01:15:38.625 --> 01:15:41.057
Just the ones that kidnap my son.

There's got to be another way out.

You're not so special. The

No, please. Leave him alone. You promised.
