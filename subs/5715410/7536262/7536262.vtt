00:01:56.086 --> 00:01:58.051
<i>Dr. Harrison, stop.</i>

3
00:01:58.053 --> 00:01:59.320
You can't run forever.

4
00:02:07.197 --> 00:02:09.196
<i>There's no escape, Doctor.</i>

5
00:02:09.198 --> 00:02:10.568
<i>You're coming with us.</i>

6
00:02:17.142 --> 00:02:20.746
Don't use your dart
gun. We got him cornered.

7
00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.422
Argh! We were so close...

8
00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.282
Daddy.

9
00:02:56.284 --> 00:02:58.819
Daddy.

10
00:03:22.813 --> 00:03:24.446
Adam Harrison!

11
00:03:24.448 --> 00:03:26.382
Yes, sir?

12
00:03:26.384 --> 00:03:28.517
No sleeping in detention.

13
00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.088
Use this time for something productive.

14
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.461
What?

15
00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:42.698
What's going on back there?

16
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.199
That's disgusting!

17
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:46.201
Adam, what's the problem?

18
00:03:46.203 --> 00:03:49.342
It looks like someone stuck
six packs of gum in my hair.

19
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.842
I didn't see nothing.

20
00:03:52.844 --> 00:03:54.144
Tony,

21
00:03:54.146 --> 00:03:55.879
go to the office.

22
00:03:55.881 --> 00:03:57.416
Not again!

23
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.826
You're dead, snitch!

24
00:04:21.743 --> 00:04:24.713
Holy crap, what's happening to me?

25
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.369
Look at his shoes!

26
00:04:47.371 --> 00:04:49.207
What... What?

27
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.443
Spaz alert.

28
00:04:55.445 --> 00:04:57.280
He used to be in my History class.

29
00:04:57.282 --> 00:04:58.614
That's why I changed classes.

30
00:04:58.616 --> 00:05:00.920
He's got like no friends.

31
00:05:03.088 --> 00:05:05.488
Hey, Adam. Are you okay?

32
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.092
Don't run, I don't bite.

33
00:05:09.026 --> 00:05:10.894
Well, look who it is.

34
00:05:10.896 --> 00:05:12.729
How ya doing, snitch?

35
00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:14.333
Leave me alone.

36
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:26.778
Hey there, mop-top, whatcha doin'?

37
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.114
Are you on your way to
the janitor's closet?

38
00:05:29.116 --> 00:05:30.982
'Cause you look like a mop!

39
00:05:30.984 --> 00:05:33.318
Good one!

40
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.985
Seriously, that counts as a good one?

41
00:05:34.987 --> 00:05:36.125
Give me a break!

42
00:05:36.824 --> 00:05:38.089
Good one!

43
00:05:38.091 --> 00:05:39.995
That's a good one.

44
00:05:40.995 --> 00:05:42.628
Get off me!

45
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.663
What? You gonna rat me out again?

46
00:05:44.665 --> 00:05:47.768
Hard to say. It depends
on the circumstances.

47
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.068
Wrong answer, snitch!

48
00:05:51.774 --> 00:05:53.009
Stop!

49
00:05:55.178 --> 00:05:56.510
Okay, you've had enough.

50
00:05:56.512 --> 00:05:58.515
Here, let me help you.

51
00:06:01.285 --> 00:06:03.587
Look at his shoes! What a freak!

52
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.990
Hey, you forgot your backpack!

53
00:06:09.126 --> 00:06:11.026
Cha-ching! Two points!

54
00:06:14.164 --> 00:06:15.466
Jerks...

55
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:23.171
It was those boys again wasn't it?

56
00:06:23.173 --> 00:06:25.475
No, I told you. I was playing soccer

57
00:06:25.477 --> 00:06:27.578
with my friends and the
ball hit me in the face.

58
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.848
Yeah? What friends
of yours play soccer?

59
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.150
The British ones...

60
00:06:33.152 --> 00:06:35.887
My mates. But they call soccer "football."

61
00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:38.990
Do they? And how did this happen?

62
00:06:38.992 --> 00:06:41.159
Soccer can be a dangerous sport.

63
00:06:41.161 --> 00:06:43.560
Adam, quit messing around.

64
00:06:43.562 --> 00:06:45.563
What are we going to do about this?

65
00:06:45.565 --> 00:06:47.732
Either we chop it out, or we chew it out.

66
00:06:47.734 --> 00:06:49.167
I vote chew.

67
00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:51.705
I vote chop.

68
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.042
Turn around.

69
00:06:59.345 --> 00:07:02.217
You had such nice, long hair.

70
00:07:18.567 --> 00:07:21.104
At least they can't make
fun of my hair anymore.

71
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:45.930
Holy crap!

72
00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:50.600
Adam, You're gonna be late!

73
00:07:50.602 --> 00:07:52.968
I'll be down in a minute!

74
00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:00.812
Adam...

75
00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:02.983
That's not gonna work.

76
00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:06.683
What's taking so long?

77
00:08:06.685 --> 00:08:08.252
Are you all right?

78
00:08:08.254 --> 00:08:09.855
I'm fine!

79
00:08:09.857 --> 00:08:11.822
I guess your meatloaf didn't agree with me.

80
00:08:11.824 --> 00:08:14.092
I thought you loved my meatloaf.

81
00:08:14.094 --> 00:08:17.128
Love is a strong word. I like it.

82
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.000
No, like's too strong.

83
00:08:19.933 --> 00:08:22.001
Hey, I hate your meatloaf.

84
00:08:22.003 --> 00:08:23.234
What?

85
00:08:23.236 --> 00:08:24.904
Listen, my meatloaf is...

86
00:08:24.906 --> 00:08:26.572
Adam.

87
00:08:26.574 --> 00:08:28.608
- What?
- That hat...

88
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.276
What about it?

89
00:08:30.278 --> 00:08:32.314
That was your father's.

90
00:08:39.822 --> 00:08:41.688
Sorry.

91
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.024
Why are you sorry?

92
00:08:43.026 --> 00:08:44.792
I dunno.

93
00:08:44.794 --> 00:08:47.928
He died. I didn't mean to make you sad.

94
00:08:49.467 --> 00:08:51.499
He was a great man.

95
00:08:51.501 --> 00:08:53.004
I wish I knew him.

96
00:08:55.939 --> 00:08:59.340
I did a sloppy job on your hair.

97
00:08:59.342 --> 00:09:02.545
I must have been more tired than I thought.

98
00:09:02.547 --> 00:09:04.246
Here, let's put this back on.

99
00:09:04.248 --> 00:09:05.550
It looks good on you.

100
00:09:07.886 --> 00:09:10.486
Now hurry up, you're going
to be late for school.

101
00:09:10.488 --> 00:09:12.890
I can't believe you don't like my meatloaf.

102
00:09:12.892 --> 00:09:14.658
I'll let you in on a secret, Mom.

103
00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.896
Nobody likes your meatloaf.

104
00:09:19.165 --> 00:09:22.699
Okay. Well, enjoy your lunch.

105
00:09:22.701 --> 00:09:24.169
It's meatloaf, isn't it?

106
00:09:24.171 --> 00:09:26.107
Could be.

107
00:09:33.014 --> 00:09:36.147
<i>All powerful men
have one thing in common.</i>

108
00:09:36.149 --> 00:09:39.018
Great hair.

109
00:09:40.654 --> 00:09:43.154
HairCo toupees have been worn in secret

110
00:09:43.156 --> 00:09:44.926
by some of the greatest men in history.

111
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.365
But you're not here to
be a part of our past,

112
00:09:52.367 --> 00:09:54.902
you're here to be part of the future.

113
00:09:54.904 --> 00:09:57.707
Make no mistake, gentlemen,
hair is a growth business.

114
00:10:04.314 --> 00:10:07.751
I'm afraid we'll need to
ask you for your cameras.

115
00:10:25.336 --> 00:10:28.338
Mr. Kobayashi, I must insist.

116
00:10:34.479 --> 00:10:35.948
Ooh.

117
00:10:39.251 --> 00:10:42.420
This is where the magic happens.

118
00:10:42.422 --> 00:10:46.391
The future isn't toupees, no, no, no.

119
00:10:46.393 --> 00:10:48.863
The future lies in growing real hair.

120
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.899
We're not talking about
embarrassing hair plugs,

121
00:10:54.901 --> 00:10:58.169
useless scalp massagers, or fancy shampoo.

122
00:10:58.171 --> 00:11:00.774
We're talking about genetic engineering.

123
00:11:00.776 --> 00:11:04.010
State of the art DNA manipulation.

124
00:11:04.012 --> 00:11:06.111
We're on the verge of a major breakthrough

125
00:11:06.113 --> 00:11:09.317
that will change the lives of
hundreds of millions of people...

126
00:11:11.987 --> 00:11:15.223
And make us a fortune in the process.

127
00:11:31.008 --> 00:11:35.176
Dr. Billingsley is our head of
experimental research and development.

128
00:11:35.178 --> 00:11:39.481
Here comes one of
our eager young interns.

129
00:11:39.483 --> 00:11:42.350
Dr. Billingsley?

130
00:11:42.352 --> 00:11:44.188
I'm getting college cedit for this, right?

131
00:11:44.822 --> 00:11:46.688
Of course.

132
00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:49.428
Okay. I'll just need you to
sign my work experience time sheet.

133
00:11:50.362 --> 00:11:51.995
Stand on the "X."

134
00:11:51.997 --> 00:11:53.862
Hold on, you're not
going to shoot me with...

135
00:11:55.167 --> 00:11:56.568
Ouch!

136
00:12:00.539 --> 00:12:02.039
Whoa.

137
00:12:04.477 --> 00:12:05.977
Ooh.

138
00:12:05.979 --> 00:12:08.746
Now, you may experience a
slight burning sensation.

139
00:12:08.748 --> 00:12:10.483
But don't worry about it.

140
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.322
Help me!

141
00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.960
As you can see,

142
00:12:21.962 --> 00:12:24.396
we're still perfecting the formula.

143
00:12:24.398 --> 00:12:28.233
Once we do, people will
pay anything for it.

144
00:12:28.235 --> 00:12:31.937
The real money is in big hair.

145
00:12:39.683 --> 00:12:43.017
Reduce fluoroantimonic
acid by five percent.

146
00:12:46.188 --> 00:12:48.724
We have a no
fighting policy at this school,

147
00:12:49.859 --> 00:12:51.125
zero tolerance.

148
00:12:51.127 --> 00:12:53.861
You fight, you're suspended!

149
00:12:53.863 --> 00:12:55.963
You're suspended!

150
00:12:55.965 --> 00:12:58.567
Do you hear me? Suspended!

151
00:12:58.569 --> 00:13:01.570
You're so funny.

152
00:13:01.572 --> 00:13:04.075
Hey, you better watch your back, snitch.

153
00:13:09.113 --> 00:13:12.448
Adam Harrison.

154
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:16.018
I believe this belongs to you.

155
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.189
Nametag was on the inside.

156
00:13:19.191 --> 00:13:20.623
Thank you, sir!

157
00:13:20.625 --> 00:13:24.161
Don't be throwing it into
basketball hoops anymore.

158
00:13:24.163 --> 00:13:27.431
What? Why would I throw my
own bag into a basketball hoop?

159
00:13:27.433 --> 00:13:30.670
Who knows why you kids do anything?

160
00:13:31.739 --> 00:13:35.506
Adam, you are what we call a...

161
00:13:35.508 --> 00:13:38.476
Mildred.

162
00:13:38.478 --> 00:13:43.316
What are we saying
instead of spazoid these days?

163
00:13:43.318 --> 00:13:46.451
Normally challenged, sir.

164
00:13:46.453 --> 00:13:48.187
And...

165
00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:51.124
How would I say "friendless loser"?

166
00:13:51.126 --> 00:13:55.361
Mid-level
acquaintance deficiency.

167
00:13:57.031 --> 00:14:01.969
Adam, you have mid-level
acquaintance deficiency.

168
00:14:01.971 --> 00:14:03.771
Do they make a pill for that?

169
00:14:03.773 --> 00:14:05.673
No, sir.

170
00:14:05.675 --> 00:14:10.511
Apparently, there's
nothing we can do for you.

171
00:14:10.513 --> 00:14:13.547
This acting out needs to stop.

172
00:14:13.549 --> 00:14:14.916
But, sir...

173
00:14:14.918 --> 00:14:17.051
We have a no fighting
policy at this school.

174
00:14:17.053 --> 00:14:21.022
Zero tolerance. You
fight, you're suspended.

175
00:14:21.024 --> 00:14:22.457
Getting beat up counts as fighting?

176
00:14:22.459 --> 00:14:26.595
A fist can't punch without
a face to receive it.

177
00:14:26.597 --> 00:14:29.331
No fighting means no fighting.

178
00:14:29.333 --> 00:14:30.666
And, Adam?

179
00:14:30.668 --> 00:14:32.936
Yes, sir?

180
00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:36.671
We have zero tolerance on hats.

181
00:14:36.673 --> 00:14:39.342
No hats in school.

182
00:14:42.046 --> 00:14:43.847
And get a haircut.

183
00:14:43.849 --> 00:14:45.017
What...

184
00:15:04.939 --> 00:15:08.040
Hey, Harrison, you got me suspended!

185
00:15:08.042 --> 00:15:10.343
You should be happy. You hate school.

186
00:15:10.345 --> 00:15:11.844
My dad's going to kill me.

187
00:15:11.846 --> 00:15:13.879
He's got a 10 strikes policy,

188
00:15:13.881 --> 00:15:15.183
and this is strike 10.

189
00:15:18.419 --> 00:15:22.156
Come on, guys, you heard Principal
Jones. He said no fighting.

190
00:15:22.158 --> 00:15:25.325
He said no fighting on school property.

191
00:15:27.831 --> 00:15:29.431
How do I look?

192
00:15:29.433 --> 00:15:31.065
You look like stupid Adam.

193
00:15:31.067 --> 00:15:32.599
This hat sucks.

194
00:15:34.569 --> 00:15:36.472
Stop!

195
00:15:37.842 --> 00:15:40.176
That's it, you're dead!

196
00:15:40.178 --> 00:15:41.976
Come on, let's get him!

197
00:15:56.161 --> 00:15:58.227
Come on, get him!

198
00:15:58.229 --> 00:16:00.096
Don't let him get away.

199
00:16:13.646 --> 00:16:16.315
Okay, guys, come on. You've had your fun.

200
00:16:16.317 --> 00:16:18.950
Don't you know how this works?

201
00:16:18.952 --> 00:16:20.384
We got him, boys!

202
00:16:20.386 --> 00:16:21.786
This is the fun part.

203
00:16:21.788 --> 00:16:23.988
Get off me!

204
00:16:31.966 --> 00:16:33.034
What the...

205
00:16:36.905 --> 00:16:38.274
Come on!

206
00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.786
What is happening to me?

207
00:16:52.788 --> 00:16:53.990
No...

208
00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.396
You gotta come out sometime.

209
00:16:59.997 --> 00:17:02.434
Yeah, and when you do, we'll be waiting.

210
00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.808
It's Friday. He
could be in there all weekend.

211
00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:16.046
Are we really gonna
wait here for three days?

212
00:17:16.048 --> 00:17:17.647
Nah. Forget him.

213
00:17:17.649 --> 00:17:19.719
Let's go bug the goats at the petting zoo.

214
00:18:31.195 --> 00:18:32.995
Were you ever going to tell me?

215
00:18:32.997 --> 00:18:36.132
Adam! You startled me.

216
00:18:36.134 --> 00:18:38.334
You said Dad was dead!

217
00:18:38.336 --> 00:18:42.006
- Adam...
- If he's dead, why is he writing letters to you?

218
00:18:42.008 --> 00:18:44.342
This one is from two weeks ago!

219
00:18:44.344 --> 00:18:45.876
"Dear Shelly, I'm sorry to hear

220
00:18:45.878 --> 00:18:47.877
"Adam is having a hard time at school."

221
00:18:47.879 --> 00:18:49.713
- Really?
- It's not what you think.

222
00:18:49.715 --> 00:18:51.683
You didn't think I'd want to meet him?

223
00:18:51.685 --> 00:18:53.151
You thought you could keep him to yourself?

224
00:18:53.153 --> 00:18:57.622
Adam, your dad is alive.

225
00:18:57.624 --> 00:18:58.924
That's all I can tell you.

226
00:18:58.926 --> 00:19:01.591
- Are you kidding me?
- I know it's hard,

227
00:19:01.593 --> 00:19:03.128
but you've got to trust me.

228
00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:05.763
Trust you! You're a liar!

229
00:19:05.765 --> 00:19:08.501
You've been lying to me
every day of my whole life!

230
00:19:08.503 --> 00:19:10.636
Adam, please...

231
00:19:10.638 --> 00:19:13.172
I thought you were the
one person I could trust,

232
00:19:13.174 --> 00:19:14.810
but you're just like everybody else.

233
00:19:17.211 --> 00:19:19.178
I hate you!

234
00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.217
Adam, no, please...

235
00:20:08.567 --> 00:20:10.901
Hey, kid. You okay?

236
00:20:10.903 --> 00:20:12.702
Just trying to get home.

237
00:20:12.704 --> 00:20:15.239
Ain't you a little young to be hitchhiking?

238
00:20:15.241 --> 00:20:18.575
I'm a little young to be
stranded at the side of the road,

239
00:20:18.577 --> 00:20:21.112
catching a cold in the pouring rain.

240
00:20:21.114 --> 00:20:23.848
Yeah. I guess so. How far you goin'?

241
00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:26.450
Route 89.

242
00:20:26.452 --> 00:20:28.954
What? Are you kidding?
That's 100 miles from here.

243
00:20:28.956 --> 00:20:30.489
So can you take me?

244
00:20:30.491 --> 00:20:33.194
It's getting
awfully cold out here.

245
00:20:34.595 --> 00:20:35.994
I don't know...

246
00:20:35.996 --> 00:20:37.663
Thanks, I really appreciate it.

247
00:20:37.665 --> 00:20:40.100
Hey, I don't remember sayin' I'd take you.

248
00:20:40.102 --> 00:20:41.968
Come on. You'd hate yourself

249
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:45.771
if I died of pneumonia
and it was all your fault.

250
00:20:47.074 --> 00:20:48.543
All right! Close the door.

251
00:21:00.956 --> 00:21:04.593
Adam? Adam, are you awake?

252
00:21:04.595 --> 00:21:06.296
Can we talk about this?

253
00:21:11.101 --> 00:21:12.704
Adam?

254
00:21:16.107 --> 00:21:18.044
No, no, no!

255
00:21:23.582 --> 00:21:27.149
Well, you don't see many
forests like this anymore.

256
00:21:27.151 --> 00:21:31.822
You walk two weeks in any
direction, and all you'd see is trees.

257
00:21:31.824 --> 00:21:35.225
I'm telling you, you wouldn't want
to get turned around out here, kid.

258
00:21:35.227 --> 00:21:37.096
No, you wouldn't.

259
00:21:38.163 --> 00:21:40.832
Well, it looks like...

260
00:21:40.834 --> 00:21:43.270
Yes, it's here! This is it!

261
00:21:45.138 --> 00:21:47.205
This is it?

262
00:21:47.207 --> 00:21:49.610
I didn't know people
actually lived out here.

263
00:21:50.877 --> 00:21:53.881
Yep, home sweet home.

264
00:21:55.849 --> 00:21:59.486
Home sweet home? Where's your house?

265
00:21:59.488 --> 00:22:02.889
My House... My house is
over there... Back a ways.

266
00:22:03.992 --> 00:22:05.928
Anyway, thanks. See ya.

267
00:22:07.363 --> 00:22:10.333
Okay. Take care of yourself, kid.

268
00:22:15.171 --> 00:22:16.507
Hello?

269
00:22:18.341 --> 00:22:20.243
Hello?

270
00:22:42.435 --> 00:22:45.838
Where'd you go? Little squirrel dude?

271
00:22:47.939 --> 00:22:50.075
Hey, wait! Come back!

272
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:53.211
That's not fair!

273
00:23:13.868 --> 00:23:17.006
Walk two weeks in any direction
and all you'll see is trees.

274
00:23:25.246 --> 00:23:26.582
Wow.

275
00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:29.949
Hello?

276
00:23:33.322 --> 00:23:35.525
Whoo!

277
00:23:42.031 --> 00:23:44.835
Hello? Somebody there?

278
00:23:47.337 --> 00:23:49.873
This isn't funny. Who's there?

279
00:24:01.786 --> 00:24:02.888
Whoa.

280
00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.208
Whoa!

281
00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:26.680
Holy cow! What in the heck was that?

282
00:24:31.284 --> 00:24:33.385
Well, I'll be...

283
00:24:35.255 --> 00:24:39.525
No service? Come on, you piece of junk!

284
00:24:39.527 --> 00:24:42.529
Stupid smartphone!

285
00:24:45.032 --> 00:24:47.501
<i>911,
what's your emergency?</i>

286
00:24:47.503 --> 00:24:50.670
My emergency is I done saw a bigfoot!

287
00:24:50.672 --> 00:24:53.073
I got the whole thing on my dashboard cam.

288
00:24:53.075 --> 00:24:57.878
<i>Bigfoot? Sir, this line is for
emergencies, not for prank calls.</i>

289
00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.216
Hello?

290
00:24:59.782 --> 00:25:01.416
Hello?

291
00:25:01.418 --> 00:25:04.755
Dang blame it, somebody's
got to believe me.

292
00:25:10.594 --> 00:25:12.860
<i>National Enquirer,
how can I help you?</i>

293
00:25:12.862 --> 00:25:15.363
Don't hang up. You gotta believe me.

294
00:25:15.365 --> 00:25:18.767
I'm calling 'cause I saw a real bigfoot.

295
00:25:18.769 --> 00:25:20.703
<i>Please hold, and
I'll put you through</i>

296
00:25:20.705 --> 00:25:23.242
<i>to Hairy Monsters,
Swampthings, and UFOs.</i>

297
00:25:24.609 --> 00:25:25.876
Bigfoot?

298
00:25:25.878 --> 00:25:27.877
Yes. Bigfoot.

299
00:25:27.879 --> 00:25:31.615
It's a dead end. We gave up the
search for Bigfoot 10 years ago.

300
00:25:31.617 --> 00:25:34.584
With all due respect, if this
thing is real, we have to have it.

301
00:25:34.586 --> 00:25:36.919
It's the genetic bridge
we've been looking for.

302
00:25:36.921 --> 00:25:42.660
No, no. I'm not wasting a
fortune on another wild goose chase.

303
00:25:42.662 --> 00:25:45.831
Think of the hair growth
potential locked in that DNA.

304
00:25:45.833 --> 00:25:48.967
No more sprays. No more toupees.

305
00:25:48.969 --> 00:25:50.602
Just real hair.

306
00:25:50.604 --> 00:25:53.639
Come on, Billingsley. You're a scientist.

307
00:25:53.641 --> 00:25:57.477
What makes you so sure this
isn't just another hoax?

308
00:25:57.479 --> 00:25:59.077
Looking at the kid in this photo,

309
00:25:59.079 --> 00:26:00.948
could there be any other conclusion?

310
00:26:06.622 --> 00:26:09.154
Is that who I think it is?

311
00:26:09.156 --> 00:26:10.824
We think so.

312
00:26:10.826 --> 00:26:13.594
Then I only have one more question...

313
00:26:13.596 --> 00:26:16.366
Who took this photo?

314
00:26:18.334 --> 00:26:20.568
So, sugar, you say you saw Bigfoot?

315
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.238
- Yes, ma'am.
- And it's going to be in the paper?

316
00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.673
- That's what they said.
- Ooh! You going to be famous.

317
00:26:25.675 --> 00:26:29.345
It's so exciting. Nothing
ever happens up here.

318
00:26:29.347 --> 00:26:30.882
This is going to be good for business.

319
00:26:32.183 --> 00:26:34.551
What's that?

320
00:26:38.489 --> 00:26:39.855
What did I tell you?

321
00:26:39.857 --> 00:26:41.157
- Teddy!
- What?

322
00:26:41.159 --> 00:26:42.791
Raise the prices!

323
00:26:42.793 --> 00:26:45.060
It happened right here.

324
00:26:45.062 --> 00:26:46.530
Check out them skids.

325
00:26:46.532 --> 00:26:49.832
I hit the brakes so hard,
I almost flipped my rig!

326
00:26:49.834 --> 00:26:51.269
Sir...

327
00:26:52.337 --> 00:26:53.907
We got something.

328
00:27:00.178 --> 00:27:01.247
Hello?

329
00:27:02.082 --> 00:27:03.550
Mrs. Harrison?

330
00:27:12.125 --> 00:27:13.326
Check the house.

331
00:27:35.351 --> 00:27:36.850
I think we got something.

332
00:27:36.852 --> 00:27:38.854
Car's gone. No sign of the mother.

333
00:27:53.738 --> 00:27:55.938
Stay away from me! Help!

334
00:27:59.609 --> 00:28:02.111
Don't come any closer!

335
00:28:02.113 --> 00:28:04.447
What... What are you?

336
00:28:04.449 --> 00:28:05.915
Well, I'm...

337
00:28:05.917 --> 00:28:07.549
I'm not sure how to break this to you...

338
00:28:07.551 --> 00:28:09.952
But I'm your dad.

339
00:28:09.954 --> 00:28:12.556
Dad? No, you're not!

340
00:28:12.558 --> 00:28:15.459
Where is he? What did you
do with him? Did you eat him?

341
00:28:15.461 --> 00:28:18.730
No, I promise, Adam. I'm your dad.

342
00:28:18.732 --> 00:28:22.799
Stop saying that! And back off!

343
00:28:22.801 --> 00:28:26.203
Ooh, easy, killer. Don't twig me to death.

344
00:28:26.205 --> 00:28:28.074
Calm down, you have nothing to fear.

345
00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:30.475
Where did you get these?

346
00:28:30.477 --> 00:28:31.810
Your mother sent them to me.

347
00:28:31.812 --> 00:28:33.480
I hate this picture.

348
00:28:35.449 --> 00:28:37.049
- That's you?
- Yep.

349
00:28:37.051 --> 00:28:39.385
It's you, me, and your mom.

350
00:28:39.387 --> 00:28:41.987
You were six months old.

351
00:28:41.989 --> 00:28:43.289
Man...

352
00:28:43.291 --> 00:28:45.158
My dad is Bigfoot?

353
00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.427
- Yep.
- Could my life get any worse?

354
00:28:48.429 --> 00:28:51.932
"Hey, Adam, your dad's famous,
but not like a rock star,

355
00:28:51.934 --> 00:28:55.535
"more like a hideous beast
that hides in the forest."

356
00:28:55.537 --> 00:28:57.504
Hideous? That's a bit strong.

357
00:28:57.506 --> 00:28:59.941
Are you kidding? You're a monster.

358
00:28:59.943 --> 00:29:01.274
I can see why you ran away.

359
00:29:01.276 --> 00:29:04.544
Whoa. I didn't leave because I'm a bigfoot.

360
00:29:04.546 --> 00:29:07.015
I left because I was being hunted.

361
00:29:07.017 --> 00:29:08.850
- Hunted?
- You see,

362
00:29:08.852 --> 00:29:12.888
a pharmaceutical company wanted
to turn me into a lab rat.

363
00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:15.858
I left to protect you and your mother.

364
00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.761
We didn't tell you for your own safety.

365
00:29:18.763 --> 00:29:20.232
What do you mean, a lab rat?

366
00:29:21.498 --> 00:29:23.466
Does your mom know you're out here?

367
00:29:23.468 --> 00:29:25.334
Yeah. She gave me the address.

368
00:29:25.336 --> 00:29:27.035
She told me to come out here...

369
00:29:27.037 --> 00:29:28.537
Alone.

370
00:29:28.539 --> 00:29:30.440
Adam, you're lying to me.

371
00:29:30.442 --> 00:29:32.808
You and mom have been
lying to me my entire life.

372
00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:34.510
We had no choice.

373
00:29:34.512 --> 00:29:37.014
You have no idea how
hard it was on both of us.

374
00:29:37.016 --> 00:29:38.649
What about me?

375
00:29:38.651 --> 00:29:42.120
It broke my heart that I couldn't
be there when you needed me.

376
00:29:42.122 --> 00:29:44.655
Adam, this is serious.

377
00:29:44.657 --> 00:29:45.989
Tell me how you found me.

378
00:29:45.991 --> 00:29:47.758
I found your letters.

379
00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.696
You took a big risk coming here.

380
00:29:50.931 --> 00:29:52.365
Your mom must be worried sick.

381
00:30:05.279 --> 00:30:07.279
- What's going on?
- Just a routine check.

382
00:30:07.281 --> 00:30:09.651
Routine? It doesn't look that way to me.

383
00:30:10.418 --> 00:30:11.718
Are you Shelly Harrison?

384
00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.887
What? Are you a police officer?

385
00:30:14.889 --> 00:30:17.356
I'm going to have to ask you to turn off
your engine and step out of the vehicle.

386
00:30:17.358 --> 00:30:18.928
Okay.

387
00:30:22.564 --> 00:30:24.432
Ma'am, it's futile.

388
00:30:24.434 --> 00:30:26.435
I suggest you get out of the car.

389
00:30:28.104 --> 00:30:30.271
She sent me everything.

390
00:30:30.273 --> 00:30:33.075
I couldn't get enough of
it. She's so proud of you.

391
00:30:33.077 --> 00:30:35.042
I always thought Mom threw these out.

392
00:30:35.044 --> 00:30:36.578
Not a single one of them.

393
00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.113
So what about me?

394
00:30:38.115 --> 00:30:41.015
Am I gonna be... Like you?

395
00:30:41.017 --> 00:30:43.619
No. You've got nothing to worry about.

396
00:30:43.621 --> 00:30:45.120
You're already 13...

397
00:30:45.122 --> 00:30:47.022
- So what?
- Well...

398
00:30:47.024 --> 00:30:48.657
You'd have symptoms by now.

399
00:30:48.659 --> 00:30:51.093
You mean like hair
that grows a foot overnight?

400
00:30:51.095 --> 00:30:53.162
Feet that blow through
the ends of my shoes?

401
00:30:53.164 --> 00:30:54.467
That kind of thing?

402
00:30:55.435 --> 00:30:57.568
I'm going to be a monster?

403
00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:59.570
It's not so bad.

404
00:30:59.572 --> 00:31:01.405
How is it not so bad?

405
00:31:01.407 --> 00:31:04.442
Spending the rest of my life
hiding in the forest like an animal?

406
00:31:04.444 --> 00:31:07.412
Slow down. What else do you have?

407
00:31:07.414 --> 00:31:11.349
The hair thing, the feet.
What about your ears?

408
00:31:11.351 --> 00:31:15.120
When your adrenaline's up,
does your hearing change?

409
00:31:15.122 --> 00:31:17.121
Sometimes it gets super loud.

410
00:31:17.123 --> 00:31:18.858
Like a migraine or something.

411
00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:20.793
When's the last time you shaved your hands?

412
00:31:20.795 --> 00:31:22.128
What? Ew! Never!

413
00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:23.294
But you shave your back?

414
00:31:23.296 --> 00:31:25.130
No. I don't shave anything.

415
00:31:25.132 --> 00:31:28.935
This is amazing. My hands
and back are where it started.

416
00:31:28.937 --> 00:31:33.340
By the time I was 12, I was waxing
my back every weekend with duct tape.

417
00:31:33.342 --> 00:31:35.141
But you're different.

418
00:31:35.143 --> 00:31:37.244
It's like you've got all the
good stuff, but none of the fur.

419
00:31:37.246 --> 00:31:39.580
How is any of this "good stuff"?

420
00:31:39.582 --> 00:31:42.851
There's a lot of good
things about being a bigfoot.

421
00:31:42.853 --> 00:31:45.456
You're standing on that leg, aren't you?

422
00:32:06.377 --> 00:32:08.845
You... You fixed my leg.

423
00:32:08.847 --> 00:32:10.413
How is that possible?

424
00:32:10.415 --> 00:32:13.817
The healing touch, fast
growing hair, big feet...

425
00:32:13.819 --> 00:32:15.684
It all goes with the territory.

426
00:32:15.686 --> 00:32:17.820
Holy moly. What are you?

427
00:32:17.822 --> 00:32:19.656
Some kind of hairy wizard?

428
00:32:19.658 --> 00:32:22.492
Ha. Nothing that exciting.

429
00:32:22.494 --> 00:32:24.997
We've got to find out what else you can do.

430
00:32:25.798 --> 00:32:27.099
Hang on to this.

431
00:32:28.368 --> 00:32:29.535
What's it do?

432
00:32:39.212 --> 00:32:40.615
Whoo-hoo!

433
00:32:44.986 --> 00:32:46.252
Whoo-hoo!

434
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:56.498
Whoa!

435
00:33:05.775 --> 00:33:09.313
Whoa!

436
00:33:15.818 --> 00:33:17.253
What's going on? It hurts!

437
00:33:24.094 --> 00:33:25.961
Just relax...

438
00:33:25.963 --> 00:33:28.764
That was so irresponsible!
You could've killed me!

439
00:33:28.766 --> 00:33:30.766
It's the adrenaline.

440
00:33:30.768 --> 00:33:32.803
Calm down.

441
00:33:32.805 --> 00:33:35.270
Take a deep breath.

442
00:33:35.272 --> 00:33:37.976
That's it. And listen.

443
00:33:44.384 --> 00:33:46.784
Whoa. It's a woodpecker.

444
00:33:46.786 --> 00:33:48.154
Focus over there.

445
00:33:57.699 --> 00:33:59.765
That's a... What do you call it?

446
00:33:59.767 --> 00:34:02.268
- A geyser.
- It's like I can see it.

447
00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:04.269
The sound makes a picture in your head.

448
00:34:04.271 --> 00:34:08.042
Dolphins and bats have something
similar called echolocation.

449
00:34:08.743 --> 00:34:10.309
Pretty cool?

450
00:34:10.311 --> 00:34:13.512
I guess. Well, Batman's cool...

451
00:34:13.514 --> 00:34:14.946
Dolphinman, not so much.

452
00:34:14.948 --> 00:34:17.049
And your feet... Tell me you've tried them?

453
00:34:17.051 --> 00:34:18.319
Ditch the shoes, buddy.

454
00:34:21.857 --> 00:34:23.357
What?

455
00:34:23.359 --> 00:34:24.524
It's cold.

456
00:34:24.526 --> 00:34:27.494
Try to keep up.

457
00:34:27.496 --> 00:34:29.463
- Whoo-hoo!
- Wait!

458
00:34:45.515 --> 00:34:46.782
Whoo-hoo!

459
00:34:46.784 --> 00:34:48.785
This is amazing!

460
00:34:48.787 --> 00:34:50.352
Feels good, doesn't it?

461
00:34:50.354 --> 00:34:52.724
Yeah! It's the greatest feeling in the...

462
00:34:56.861 --> 00:34:58.430
Whoo-hoo!

463
00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:06.569
Whoo!

464
00:35:10.209 --> 00:35:11.378
Whoo!

465
00:35:16.516 --> 00:35:18.218
Whoo-hoo!!

466
00:35:18.751 --> 00:35:20.419
Whoo...

467
00:35:20.421 --> 00:35:21.955
Ouch, buddy..

468
00:35:21.957 --> 00:35:24.424
I'm so sorry. I should've warned you.

469
00:35:24.426 --> 00:35:28.027
You've gotta avoid smashing
head first into the trees.

470
00:35:30.098 --> 00:35:32.599
I think I'm done with
bigfoot lessons for the day.

471
00:35:32.601 --> 00:35:34.066
There's one more thing.

472
00:35:34.068 --> 00:35:36.070
Does it involve smashing
head first into anything?

473
00:35:36.072 --> 00:35:38.771
Nope. I can talk to animals.

474
00:35:38.773 --> 00:35:39.938
Are you kidding?

475
00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:41.374
Just watch.

476
00:35:41.376 --> 00:35:43.076
Hey, Steve, come over here.

477
00:35:54.256 --> 00:35:56.391
So what did you say to her?

478
00:35:56.393 --> 00:35:59.228
I love it.

479
00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:01.896
I just hear chirps. I
guess I don't have that one.

480
00:36:01.898 --> 00:36:06.371
Give it a shot. The secret
here is to slow things down.

481
00:36:14.111 --> 00:36:15.578
Nice to finally meet you, Adam.

482
00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:17.680
You look better in real
life than in your photo.

483
00:36:17.682 --> 00:36:19.483
- No way.
- Yes way.

484
00:36:19.485 --> 00:36:20.784
It works!

485
00:36:20.786 --> 00:36:23.688
It... Is... Nice... To... Meet... You!

486
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:25.788
You don't need to talk like that.

487
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:27.257
They understand you just fine.

488
00:36:27.259 --> 00:36:29.659
What am I? Chopped liver?

489
00:36:29.661 --> 00:36:32.930
Sheesh. He doesn't even introduce me!

490
00:36:32.932 --> 00:36:34.765
The trees talk too?

491
00:36:34.767 --> 00:36:36.169
This place is like a Disney movie!

492
00:36:37.271 --> 00:36:39.771
Hello...!

493
00:36:39.773 --> 00:36:42.841
Trees don't talk, you stupid idiot.

494
00:36:42.843 --> 00:36:44.442
That's just Trapper.

495
00:36:46.179 --> 00:36:48.279
<i>Enchante.!</i>

496
00:36:48.281 --> 00:36:51.083
Yeah. This is my lovely wife, Weecha.

497
00:36:51.085 --> 00:36:52.685
<i>She's also enchanted.</i>

498
00:36:52.687 --> 00:36:54.286
Hello.

499
00:36:54.288 --> 00:36:55.923
Nice to finally meet you, Adam.

500
00:36:55.925 --> 00:36:58.358
Your dad talks about you all the time.

501
00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:59.959
Every real man has a son.

502
00:36:59.961 --> 00:37:01.861
I got kids on the way myself.

503
00:37:01.863 --> 00:37:03.296
All boys.

504
00:37:03.298 --> 00:37:04.997
We don't know that.

505
00:37:04.999 --> 00:37:06.832
I can tell.

506
00:37:06.834 --> 00:37:09.906
How you doin', fellas? Gettin'
big and strong in there? Good.

507
00:37:11.241 --> 00:37:12.672
I have to say...

508
00:37:12.674 --> 00:37:15.176
- The kid doesn't look like a bigfoot.
- Trapper!

509
00:37:15.178 --> 00:37:17.212
What? I'm just calling it like it is.

510
00:37:17.214 --> 00:37:20.416
You've all got eyes. This is a bigfoot.

511
00:37:20.418 --> 00:37:23.251
This is a boy. It's Humans 101.

512
00:37:23.253 --> 00:37:26.521
Don't listen to Trapper. Nobody here does.

513
00:37:26.523 --> 00:37:29.691
Are you kidding?
I'm like the boss around here!

514
00:37:29.693 --> 00:37:32.995
Everybody in this forest
hangs off my every word.

515
00:37:32.997 --> 00:37:35.799
Is he always like that?

516
00:37:35.801 --> 00:37:37.236
What a place.

517
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:40.272
I'm starting to like it here.

518
00:37:45.411 --> 00:37:47.380
Don't run and don't turn your back to him.

519
00:37:49.081 --> 00:37:51.218
No. He's a big one!

520
00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.057
Careful, Dad! Don't...

521
00:38:03.564 --> 00:38:07.265
Nice performance, Wilbur. 10 out of 10!

522
00:38:07.267 --> 00:38:10.737
Well, thanks. I've been practicing.

523
00:38:10.739 --> 00:38:13.373
You jerk! I almost had a heart attack.

524
00:38:13.375 --> 00:38:14.873
Nothing to be afraid of.

525
00:38:14.875 --> 00:38:16.576
This is just Wilbur.

526
00:38:16.578 --> 00:38:19.812
He's a big teddy bear,
sweeter than a pot of honey.

527
00:38:19.814 --> 00:38:21.483
I am not!

528
00:38:22.316 --> 00:38:24.952
Okay, maybe I am.

529
00:38:24.954 --> 00:38:26.486
This is my son, Adam.

530
00:38:26.488 --> 00:38:28.821
Pleased to meet you, kid.

531
00:38:28.823 --> 00:38:30.925
Over the hill...

532
00:38:30.927 --> 00:38:33.395
Hello.

533
00:38:33.397 --> 00:38:35.730
- Two of 'em...
- Wow, slow down, Tina.

534
00:38:35.732 --> 00:38:37.598
Breathe through your nose.

535
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.902
I ain't got time to
breathe through my nose!

536
00:38:39.904 --> 00:38:42.436
I'm talkin' about rednecks with guns!

537
00:38:42.438 --> 00:38:45.307
Hoo-hoo, hunters!

538
00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:47.075
Hunters? Should we hide?

539
00:38:47.077 --> 00:38:49.814
That won't be necessary.

540
00:38:51.715 --> 00:38:54.383
I, my friend, am a connoisseur

541
00:38:54.385 --> 00:38:56.286
and when it comes to hamburgers,

542
00:38:56.288 --> 00:39:00.056
this is a tasty piece of beef.

543
00:39:00.058 --> 00:39:02.391
I thought you got the fried chicken.

544
00:39:02.393 --> 00:39:06.830
My point is, whatever
it is, it's delicious.

545
00:39:08.601 --> 00:39:11.304
We haven't had hunters in three seasons!

546
00:39:13.139 --> 00:39:16.039
Blue 32. Green 180. Hut!

547
00:39:17.476 --> 00:39:19.276
Yee-haw!

548
00:39:19.278 --> 00:39:22.480
You think that'd be cruelty
to animals, but she loves it.

549
00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.053
My point is,

550
00:39:28.055 --> 00:39:30.022
we're smarter than them animals,

551
00:39:30.024 --> 00:39:33.028
so they deserve to die.

552
00:39:49.111 --> 00:39:51.178
That's the sign.

553
00:39:59.657 --> 00:40:02.724
It's a dog-eat-dog
world, my friend,

554
00:40:02.726 --> 00:40:04.458
but I ain't eatin' no dog.

555
00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:06.628
Which brings me back to my hamburger.

556
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:08.497
That would be a chicken burger.

557
00:40:08.499 --> 00:40:09.868
Whatever burger.

558
00:40:28.754 --> 00:40:30.123
I got it!

559
00:40:30.855 --> 00:40:32.124
I saw it first!

560
00:40:38.465 --> 00:40:41.066
We got him, my friend!

561
00:40:41.068 --> 00:40:44.937
I told you dousing
ourselves in that bear urine

562
00:40:44.939 --> 00:40:46.605
would make us in-detectable.

563
00:40:46.607 --> 00:40:48.040
Like the Invisible Man.

564
00:40:48.042 --> 00:40:50.710
Ooh, you were right about that one, buddy.

565
00:40:50.712 --> 00:40:54.112
All we gotta do before we mount it
on the wall is make sure it's dead.

566
00:40:54.114 --> 00:40:55.483
Let's take a look.

567
00:40:57.719 --> 00:40:59.686
Yup. He's a goner.

568
00:40:59.688 --> 00:41:04.624
I love destroying
nature's most majestic creatures!

569
00:41:04.626 --> 00:41:07.894
Come on, get your butt
in here. Selfie time!

570
00:41:12.935 --> 00:41:15.636
<i>I'm gonna
post that up on Facebook,</i>

571
00:41:15.638 --> 00:41:17.404
<i>and watch the likes come rollin' in.</i>

572
00:41:17.406 --> 00:41:19.440
<i>Don't you be tagging me!</i>

573
00:41:19.442 --> 00:41:22.144
<i>My wife thinks I'm down at the
community college studyin' to be an...</i>

574
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:28.952
Zombie bear!

575
00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.456
He's undead!

576
00:41:33.357 --> 00:41:34.892
I did poke it!

577
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.735
And stay out!

578
00:41:44.737 --> 00:41:47.070
Nice shot, honey.

579
00:41:47.072 --> 00:41:50.974
They won't be
coming back for a while.

580
00:41:50.976 --> 00:41:54.179
That was the
best thing I've ever seen!

581
00:41:57.484 --> 00:41:59.350
At least you guys know
how to have a good time.

582
00:41:59.352 --> 00:42:02.086
We make the most of it.

583
00:42:02.088 --> 00:42:04.089
It's nice to finally have a dad.

584
00:42:04.091 --> 00:42:07.024
Well, then, son, we've got
to make up for lost time.

585
00:42:07.026 --> 00:42:09.027
All right. Where do we start?

586
00:42:09.029 --> 00:42:10.797
I don't know.

587
00:42:10.799 --> 00:42:16.369
Okay, so what's the best
father-son thing you can think of?

588
00:42:16.371 --> 00:42:19.337
Want to play baseball?

589
00:42:19.339 --> 00:42:22.044
Sure, why not? You got a ball?

590
00:42:24.914 --> 00:42:27.180
Whoa, I would have picked
a different activity

591
00:42:27.182 --> 00:42:29.649
if I'd known you had to
whittle a ball from scratch.

592
00:42:29.651 --> 00:42:31.218
That's how things work around here.

593
00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.920
You have to rely on yourself.

594
00:42:32.922 --> 00:42:35.355
Yeah. I guess you can't just
order it off the Internet.

595
00:42:35.357 --> 00:42:37.592
What's the Internet?

596
00:42:37.594 --> 00:42:40.261
You've never heard of the
Internet? Are you kidding me?

597
00:42:40.263 --> 00:42:41.862
Adam, I'm joking.

598
00:42:41.864 --> 00:42:44.498
I know what the Internet is. Come on!

599
00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:47.237
I have tons of friends on MySpace.

600
00:42:48.472 --> 00:42:51.305
Things have changed a little bit.

601
00:42:51.307 --> 00:42:52.673
You'll see when you come back.

602
00:42:52.675 --> 00:42:55.045
Adam, I told you. I can't.

603
00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:59.415
I'm sorry, I know how you feel.

604
00:42:59.417 --> 00:43:01.053
Come on, son, show me what you got.

605
00:43:01.986 --> 00:43:03.386
Okay, Pops.

606
00:43:13.164 --> 00:43:16.099
Whoa, maybe we should try something else.

607
00:43:17.269 --> 00:43:19.005
Whoo-hoo!

608
00:43:19.706 --> 00:43:21.007
Whoo!

609
00:43:33.987 --> 00:43:35.790
Whoa, that felt great.

610
00:43:41.962 --> 00:43:44.231
Come on out, I'll race you back.

611
00:43:44.233 --> 00:43:47.167
All right, old man, bring it on.

612
00:43:55.778 --> 00:43:57.712
Give me a second.

613
00:43:57.714 --> 00:44:00.047
What's wrong, gettin' tired?

614
00:44:00.049 --> 00:44:01.616
You wish.

615
00:44:01.618 --> 00:44:03.284
Whoo-hoo!

616
00:44:03.286 --> 00:44:05.156
Hey, no fair!

617
00:44:18.436 --> 00:44:20.803
You totally cheated!

618
00:44:20.805 --> 00:44:22.975
We'll call it a tie.

619
00:44:23.808 --> 00:44:26.176
Whoa! Did you make this?

620
00:44:26.178 --> 00:44:28.645
Sure did. So do you play?

621
00:44:28.647 --> 00:44:30.382
Yeah. I love guitar!

622
00:44:36.456 --> 00:44:38.055
Yeah,

623
00:44:38.057 --> 00:44:40.191
try not squeezing so tight.

624
00:44:40.193 --> 00:44:43.997
Yeah, leave a little
space... Yeah, yeah. Okay.

625
00:44:46.701 --> 00:44:48.833
I think it's out of tune or something.

626
00:44:48.835 --> 00:44:51.670
Do you play or is it just to look cool?

627
00:44:51.672 --> 00:44:53.908
Well, you'll be the judge.

628
00:45:16.698 --> 00:45:18.232
Holy crap!

629
00:45:18.234 --> 00:45:20.567
Well, I've had lots of time to practice.

630
00:45:20.569 --> 00:45:22.570
Can you teach me how to do that?

631
00:45:22.572 --> 00:45:25.539
Well, maybe a little
bit more rock and roll.

632
00:45:25.541 --> 00:45:27.444
Of course, I'd be happy to.

633
00:45:33.083 --> 00:45:34.616
You have to come home with me.

634
00:45:34.618 --> 00:45:38.587
Adam, I wish I
could, but it's not safe.

635
00:45:38.589 --> 00:45:42.057
We can keep you a secret.
No one will ever know.

636
00:45:42.059 --> 00:45:43.892
They don't even know you're alive!

637
00:45:43.894 --> 00:45:45.593
HairCo will find out.

638
00:45:45.595 --> 00:45:48.197
I'm sure they've been
monitoring you and your mom.

639
00:45:48.199 --> 00:45:52.135
They're relentless. I've seen it firsthand.

640
00:45:52.137 --> 00:45:54.036
When I was in medical school,

641
00:45:54.038 --> 00:45:56.005
<i>I started studying my hair growth,</i>

642
00:45:56.007 --> 00:45:59.877
<i>desperately trying to make sense
of what was happening to me.</i>

643
00:45:59.879 --> 00:46:03.180
<i>I discovered a rare DNA
mutation in my blood</i>

644
00:46:03.182 --> 00:46:06.618
<i>was triggering a resurgence
of Neanderthal features.</i>

645
00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:09.056
<i>Every day I was becoming
more of a bigfoot.</i>

646
00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:13.025
<i>HairCo found out
about my experiments.</i>

647
00:46:13.027 --> 00:46:16.027
<i>At first they tried to hire me</i>

648
00:46:16.029 --> 00:46:19.098
<i>but when I declined,
my lab was ransacked,</i>

649
00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:21.968
<i>and all my research stolen.</i>

650
00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:24.303
<i>That's when things got
really out of control.</i>

651
00:46:24.305 --> 00:46:26.138
<i>They threatened your mother.</i>

652
00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:29.008
<i>We couldn't go anywhere
without being followed.</i>

653
00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:33.146
I knew the only way to keep
you safe was to disappear.

654
00:46:33.148 --> 00:46:36.683
Why didn't they come after me?
Don't we have the same...

655
00:46:36.685 --> 00:46:39.953
DNA. Yes, we do, but when you were younger,

656
00:46:39.955 --> 00:46:42.855
the genetic mutation hadn't activated yet.

657
00:46:42.857 --> 00:46:47.162
I'm sure they found some of your genetic
material when they ransacked the house.

658
00:46:47.164 --> 00:46:50.030
But back then, you'd have
seemed totally normal.

659
00:46:50.032 --> 00:46:51.633
That must be why they left us alone.

660
00:46:51.635 --> 00:46:54.302
And it's the reason I can't come back.

661
00:46:54.304 --> 00:46:57.139
It's too dangerous. If
they even suspect I'm alive,

662
00:46:57.141 --> 00:46:59.310
they'll stop at nothing
to get what they want.

663
00:47:03.781 --> 00:47:04.948
You.

664
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:06.248
What are you doing here?

665
00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:08.484
All day breakfast, of course.

666
00:47:08.486 --> 00:47:12.255
I jest. Please sit, Mrs. Harrison,

667
00:47:12.257 --> 00:47:16.027
so that we might solve the
problem of your missing boy.

668
00:47:16.029 --> 00:47:18.329
He hates that photo.

669
00:47:18.331 --> 00:47:20.664
You expect me to believe
you're here because of my son?

670
00:47:20.666 --> 00:47:22.134
You got me.

671
00:47:22.136 --> 00:47:24.102
I don't care about your son,

672
00:47:24.104 --> 00:47:27.408
but if we find him, we find your husband.

673
00:47:28.173 --> 00:47:29.841
My husband?

674
00:47:29.843 --> 00:47:31.910
He died a long time ago. You know that.

675
00:47:31.912 --> 00:47:33.812
Yes, well... No.

676
00:47:33.814 --> 00:47:37.552
Some new evidence has come to my
attention. Please read the headline.

677
00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:40.521
"Baby born in a pumpkin."

678
00:47:41.822 --> 00:47:43.924
The other headline.

679
00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:48.261
Bigfoot? Really?

680
00:47:48.263 --> 00:47:53.332
Before he disappeared, your husband
was working on strange experiments.

681
00:47:53.334 --> 00:47:57.705
Studying hair growth.
Hair like we've never seen.

682
00:47:57.707 --> 00:48:00.577
Hair like that of say, a bigfoot.

683
00:48:02.179 --> 00:48:05.079
Quite a coincidence, wouldn't you say?

684
00:48:05.081 --> 00:48:10.852
Your son happens to show up at the
first Bigfoot sighting in 10 years?

685
00:48:10.854 --> 00:48:13.856
I don't think your husband
was studying Bigfoot.

686
00:48:13.858 --> 00:48:16.327
I think he is Bigfoot.

687
00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:22.363
Ta-da! And you said I don't
wine and dine you anymore.

688
00:48:22.365 --> 00:48:24.333
Something isn't right.

689
00:48:24.335 --> 00:48:26.237
I thought you might say that.

690
00:48:27.038 --> 00:48:28.906
Perfect-issimo.

691
00:48:28.908 --> 00:48:32.308
A beautiful meal for my beautiful wife,

692
00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:34.644
and my
soon-to-be-born sons.

693
00:48:34.646 --> 00:48:37.782
Eat up boys, no runts in this litter!

694
00:48:37.784 --> 00:48:43.023
Shh, I'm serious. What are all
these black cars doing here?

695
00:48:45.224 --> 00:48:46.526
No.

696
00:48:47.727 --> 00:48:50.295
I know. He hates that photo.

697
00:48:55.236 --> 00:48:58.303
That's Bigfoot's wife.

698
00:48:58.305 --> 00:49:00.438
We're not leaving until we find him.

699
00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:03.578
Tear the forest down if you have to.

700
00:49:05.713 --> 00:49:08.215
Yuck. Looks way too healthy.

701
00:49:08.217 --> 00:49:10.450
Well, it is. And tastes good too.

702
00:49:10.452 --> 00:49:12.218
Ooh, don't you have any meat?

703
00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:13.821
I'm afraid not.

704
00:49:13.823 --> 00:49:16.457
You kind of have to be
a vegetarian out here.

705
00:49:16.459 --> 00:49:19.826
You eat one of those guys and
everyone starts asking questions.

706
00:49:19.828 --> 00:49:21.729
No, who ate Trapper?

707
00:49:21.731 --> 00:49:25.166
Where's Trapper? Have you seen Trapper?

708
00:49:25.168 --> 00:49:26.967
You can try to reason with them,

709
00:49:26.969 --> 00:49:29.469
but nobody cares that he's delicious.

710
00:49:29.471 --> 00:49:30.704
I am trying to tell them, you know,

711
00:49:30.706 --> 00:49:33.141
a little salt and pepper
on the old Trapper,

712
00:49:33.143 --> 00:49:35.778
it's so good. They don't want to hear it.

713
00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:38.216
I see how that could be awkward.

714
00:49:38.783 --> 00:49:40.182
Whoa, hot.

715
00:49:40.184 --> 00:49:42.051
Hot but good, right?

716
00:49:42.053 --> 00:49:43.785
No... Just hot.

717
00:49:43.787 --> 00:49:45.187
You have to admit,

718
00:49:45.189 --> 00:49:46.656
it's better than Mom's meatloaf.

719
00:49:46.658 --> 00:49:49.726
I'll give you that. What
is in that stuff anyway?

720
00:49:49.728 --> 00:49:53.496
Car tires, wet cardboard
boxes and lots of ketchup.

721
00:49:57.969 --> 00:49:59.803
We got a big problem.

722
00:49:59.805 --> 00:50:01.439
What's this?

723
00:50:01.441 --> 00:50:03.006
We saw Adam's mom. They
got her locked in a trailer.

724
00:50:03.008 --> 00:50:04.209
- Shelly?
- Mom?

725
00:50:04.211 --> 00:50:06.010
Hold on, it gets worse.

726
00:50:06.012 --> 00:50:08.581
There are a bazillion dudes
in suits heading this way.

727
00:50:20.294 --> 00:50:21.993
I'm sorry... I...

728
00:50:21.995 --> 00:50:23.829
You led them right to us.

729
00:50:23.831 --> 00:50:27.532
And what's worse, you
put your mother in danger!

730
00:50:27.534 --> 00:50:29.503
- I...
- Adam, what have you done?

731
00:50:29.505 --> 00:50:30.803
I didn't mean to.

732
00:50:30.805 --> 00:50:33.673
Actions have consequences.

733
00:50:33.675 --> 00:50:36.576
You should never have come here.

734
00:50:36.578 --> 00:50:38.846
Well, you better do something.

735
00:50:38.848 --> 00:50:42.181
If they find Bigfoot, the jig is up!

736
00:50:42.183 --> 00:50:43.283
I can fix this!

737
00:50:43.285 --> 00:50:44.551
What are you doing?

738
00:50:44.553 --> 00:50:46.187
I'll tell them I'm okay. It'll be fine.

739
00:50:46.189 --> 00:50:48.356
No, Adam, you don't know
who you're dealing with...

740
00:50:56.298 --> 00:50:57.434
Please be safe.

741
00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:01.069
Over here, you found me!

742
00:51:01.071 --> 00:51:03.605
Adam Harrison, the missing boy.

743
00:51:03.607 --> 00:51:06.211
Everything's fine. We can all go home.!

744
00:51:16.355 --> 00:51:18.054
Mom!

745
00:51:18.056 --> 00:51:19.856
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

746
00:51:19.858 --> 00:51:22.559
I'm sorry, Mom. I shouldn't have run away.

747
00:51:22.561 --> 00:51:24.095
And I should've told you the truth.

748
00:51:24.097 --> 00:51:26.964
There's a hundred agents in
the forest looking for Dad.

749
00:51:26.966 --> 00:51:29.267
Adam, shh, watch what you say.

750
00:51:29.269 --> 00:51:30.968
Don't worry, they'll never find him.

751
00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:34.071
He's hiding in the tunnels
near the base of the waterfall.

752
00:51:36.277 --> 00:51:38.510
This is an all-call.

753
00:51:38.512 --> 00:51:42.748
All agents re-route to sector G16.

754
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:48.421
<i>I repeat, the prize is
in G16. I'm on my way.</i>

755
00:51:48.423 --> 00:51:53.158
You heard the man, turn
it around. Double time.

756
00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:56.564
The bigfoot is hiding down there.

757
00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:02.670
What are you waiting for? Get down there!

758
00:52:02.672 --> 00:52:04.270
I hear something.

759
00:52:04.272 --> 00:52:06.607
What is it?

760
00:52:16.653 --> 00:52:19.187
Someone push you in the pool?

761
00:52:19.189 --> 00:52:21.823
Adam! Don't hurt him! Please!

762
00:52:21.825 --> 00:52:24.293
Take her home. The boy rides with me.

763
00:52:24.295 --> 00:52:25.862
Where are you taking him?

764
00:52:25.864 --> 00:52:29.031
Don't worry, we'll be right behind you.

765
00:52:29.033 --> 00:52:31.870
We're going to have a little chat.

766
00:52:51.892 --> 00:52:54.993
One last chance. Where is your father?

767
00:52:54.995 --> 00:52:57.027
So you can lock him in a cage?

768
00:52:57.029 --> 00:53:00.266
Your father's DNA can
help millions of people.

769
00:53:00.268 --> 00:53:04.403
People who just want a
full head of healthy hair.

770
00:53:04.405 --> 00:53:07.173
So you just take some DNA and let him go?

771
00:53:07.175 --> 00:53:10.242
Not exactly. We'll be partners.

772
00:53:10.244 --> 00:53:13.513
Your dad will work exclusively for us.

773
00:53:13.515 --> 00:53:14.980
Give me a break.

774
00:53:14.982 --> 00:53:16.417
Adam, listen to me...

775
00:53:16.419 --> 00:53:18.586
He's not a lab rat. He's my dad!

776
00:53:22.024 --> 00:53:26.764
It's becoming clear to me that you
have no interest in negotiating.

777
00:53:27.563 --> 00:53:29.398
<i>Light it up, boys.</i>

778
00:53:34.103 --> 00:53:35.870
Are you crazy?

779
00:53:35.872 --> 00:53:40.676
Crazy is such an ugly
word. I prefer "motivated."

780
00:53:40.678 --> 00:53:42.977
You'll never catch him. There's
too much forest out there.

781
00:53:42.979 --> 00:53:47.351
My boy, the fire's
not for him. It's for you.

782
00:53:54.592 --> 00:53:56.492
Nice doing business with you.

783
00:53:56.494 --> 00:53:57.726
No!

784
00:54:22.089 --> 00:54:23.857
Help! Help me!

785
00:54:43.078 --> 00:54:44.047
Dad!

786
00:54:44.547 --> 00:54:45.849
Hang on!

787
00:54:53.389 --> 00:54:54.424
No!

788
00:54:56.226 --> 00:54:58.726
So predictable.

789
00:54:58.728 --> 00:55:01.399
Dad. Come on. Please.

790
00:55:18.550 --> 00:55:19.552
Dad!

791
00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:34.200
Mission accomplished. So long!

792
00:55:45.011 --> 00:55:46.446
Wake up, Adam.

793
00:55:50.218 --> 00:55:51.420
Wake up.

794
00:55:51.887 --> 00:55:53.285
Dad?

795
00:55:53.287 --> 00:55:55.955
He's awake. Are you okay?

796
00:55:55.957 --> 00:55:58.358
I... I think so.

797
00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:01.529
All right, then. Take
care of yourself, kid.

798
00:56:01.531 --> 00:56:03.531
Wait, where are you going?

799
00:56:03.533 --> 00:56:05.933
To find a new place to start over.

800
00:56:05.935 --> 00:56:07.134
You're just going to leave?

801
00:56:07.136 --> 00:56:09.069
Well, not much left here for us, is there?

802
00:56:09.071 --> 00:56:10.073
Way to go, man.

803
00:56:16.046 --> 00:56:17.782
Hey! Wait.

804
00:56:18.949 --> 00:56:20.381
Stop.

805
00:56:22.452 --> 00:56:24.352
Hey, I said stop!

806
00:56:29.861 --> 00:56:31.794
If you're going to bite my head off, do it.

807
00:56:31.796 --> 00:56:33.564
Otherwise, I've got something to say.

808
00:56:36.033 --> 00:56:38.769
I've got a plan but I need your help.

809
00:56:38.771 --> 00:56:41.106
It's your problem, not ours.

810
00:56:42.742 --> 00:56:45.575
This isn't about me, it's about my dad.

811
00:56:45.577 --> 00:56:48.479
I made the mistake, he
shouldn't have to pay for it.

812
00:56:48.481 --> 00:56:51.917
So you want us to bail you out now? Nice.

813
00:56:51.919 --> 00:56:53.785
I didn't mean for this to happen.

814
00:56:53.787 --> 00:56:57.087
I just came out here to
find my family. I'm sorry.

815
00:56:57.089 --> 00:56:59.924
Sorry isn't going to
unburn down our forest!

816
00:56:59.926 --> 00:57:03.929
If I could take it back,
I would. But I can't.

817
00:57:03.931 --> 00:57:06.264
Please, guys, I need your help.

818
00:57:06.266 --> 00:57:08.699
When animals go up against humans,

819
00:57:08.701 --> 00:57:10.601
humans always win.

820
00:57:10.603 --> 00:57:13.673
I'm not gonna end up a bearskin rug.

821
00:57:13.675 --> 00:57:16.343
What would Bigfoot do
if you were in trouble?

822
00:57:16.345 --> 00:57:17.977
Would he just walk away?

823
00:57:17.979 --> 00:57:20.513
Sometimes doing the right thing is hard.

824
00:57:20.515 --> 00:57:23.582
I'm not going to tell
you it won't be dangerous.

825
00:57:23.584 --> 00:57:26.454
But the only way we stand a
chance is if we work together.

826
00:57:26.456 --> 00:57:29.326
Please, Bigfoot needs your help.

827
00:57:30.994 --> 00:57:34.360
The kid's right. Bigfoot needs us.

828
00:57:34.362 --> 00:57:36.999
I agree with them, I'm in.

829
00:57:37.001 --> 00:57:39.533
All right then, we're in.

830
00:57:39.535 --> 00:57:42.370
Whoa, wait, we're not
even going to discuss it?

831
00:57:42.372 --> 00:57:46.675
I was going to say "in"
too, you just said it first.

832
00:57:46.677 --> 00:57:48.678
What do you say, Wilbur?

833
00:57:51.181 --> 00:57:53.016
Okay.

834
00:57:53.018 --> 00:57:54.953
Let's do it for Bigfoot.

835
00:58:12.104 --> 00:58:14.672
I
could watch that all day.

836
00:58:14.674 --> 00:58:16.473
It's incredible.

837
00:58:16.475 --> 00:58:20.377
The structure of the hair is
different at the molecular level.

838
00:58:22.716 --> 00:58:25.084
It's awake.

839
00:58:25.086 --> 00:58:27.820
Good morning, my dear beast.

840
00:58:27.822 --> 00:58:31.657
Or should I say... Doctor Harrison?

841
00:58:31.659 --> 00:58:33.592
Let me go!

842
00:58:33.594 --> 00:58:35.197
Calm down.

843
00:58:38.533 --> 00:58:40.067
Or not.

844
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:41.304
Get back!

845
00:58:43.238 --> 00:58:45.404
No, no, no. There's no need for that.

846
00:58:45.406 --> 00:58:49.109
Do you have any idea what that thing costs?

847
00:58:49.111 --> 00:58:51.778
I'm sure we've got another one.

848
00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:55.115
The benefits of being rich.

849
00:58:55.117 --> 00:58:58.654
This thing here, I have no idea what it is.

850
00:59:01.725 --> 00:59:04.292
But we'll replace it too.

851
00:59:04.294 --> 00:59:07.763
The only thing of value
here is our new friend.

852
00:59:07.765 --> 00:59:09.964
You'll never get what you want from me.

853
00:59:09.966 --> 00:59:12.801
I'll fight you every step of the way.

854
00:59:12.803 --> 00:59:14.972
No, you won't.

855
00:59:14.974 --> 00:59:16.773
You want to know how I know?

856
00:59:16.775 --> 00:59:18.777
Your family is still out there.

857
00:59:19.844 --> 00:59:21.612
Leave them out of this.

858
00:59:21.614 --> 00:59:23.579
Happily. I have no use for them.

859
00:59:23.581 --> 00:59:25.950
But if you make life hard for us,

860
00:59:25.952 --> 00:59:28.819
we can make life very hard for them.

861
00:59:28.821 --> 00:59:32.223
That said, if you cooperate...

862
00:59:32.225 --> 00:59:35.426
I promise to take good care of your family.

863
00:59:35.428 --> 00:59:38.432
So, Mr. Bigfoot, what will it be?

864
00:59:44.971 --> 00:59:47.438
Well, guys, it looks like we're
going to have to hitch a ride.

865
00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:48.507
Got it.

866
00:59:51.079 --> 00:59:53.479
- What?
- More of a covert ride.

867
00:59:53.481 --> 00:59:56.283
Got it.

868
00:59:56.285 --> 00:59:59.852
Okay, we'll wait for the last
trailer in the convoy. Everyone ready?

869
00:59:59.854 --> 01:00:01.153
I was born ready.

870
01:00:01.155 --> 01:00:02.955
Actually, I was born a few weeks early.

871
01:00:02.957 --> 01:00:04.391
I needed a lot of help to get started...

872
01:00:04.393 --> 01:00:06.027
- Shut up.
- Will you shut up?

873
01:00:06.029 --> 01:00:07.326
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

874
01:00:07.328 --> 01:00:08.495
What?

875
01:00:08.497 --> 01:00:10.830
Okay, guys, it's now or never.

876
01:00:10.832 --> 01:00:12.732
Are you sure about this?

877
01:00:12.734 --> 01:00:13.836
Now.

878
01:00:17.374 --> 01:00:19.577
This is nuts. Whoa!

879
01:00:21.711 --> 01:00:22.713
Whoa!

880
01:00:30.154 --> 01:00:32.022
Wait! Hold on!

881
01:00:32.555 --> 01:00:33.855
Wilbur! Run!

882
01:00:33.857 --> 01:00:35.560
What do you think I'm doing?

883
01:00:44.702 --> 01:00:46.702
Whoa, what was that?

884
01:00:46.704 --> 01:00:47.970
Why you don't y'all go check it out?

885
01:00:47.972 --> 01:00:50.707
Aw, why do I have to
go? I'm covered in latte!

886
01:00:50.709 --> 01:00:53.544
You're drinking a latte?

887
01:00:53.546 --> 01:00:55.048
What's wrong with that?

888
01:00:56.249 --> 01:00:58.551
Fine. Let's both go.

889
01:01:03.023 --> 01:01:05.260
All right, let's roll.

890
01:01:11.965 --> 01:01:15.301
Hang on tight, guys. This
is going to be a long ride.

891
01:01:15.303 --> 01:01:18.072
Check out Steve. He's loving it.

892
01:01:22.443 --> 01:01:25.611
This is amazing.

893
01:01:26.882 --> 01:01:28.250
He probably got tired
of pecking for a living.

894
01:01:30.585 --> 01:01:32.619
I've extracted the bigfoot DNA

895
01:01:32.621 --> 01:01:34.588
and spliced it into the sequence.

896
01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:36.422
So what are you waiting for?

897
01:01:36.424 --> 01:01:39.294
This needs to be tested immediately.

898
01:01:39.296 --> 01:01:40.931
Send in the intern.

899
01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:46.234
Dr. Billingsley? Hi.

900
01:01:46.236 --> 01:01:48.403
I... I don't mean to bother you,

901
01:01:48.405 --> 01:01:51.940
but I really need you
to sign my time sheet...

902
01:01:51.942 --> 01:01:53.909
No, not again!

903
01:01:53.911 --> 01:01:59.648
Ouch! I need to really
call my academic adviser.

904
01:02:04.090 --> 01:02:06.856
What's going on?

905
01:02:06.858 --> 01:02:10.162
My hair, it's growing.

906
01:02:18.671 --> 01:02:20.437
Incredible!

907
01:02:20.439 --> 01:02:23.641
It will be, but I'm still
fine-tuning the genetic sequence.

908
01:02:23.643 --> 01:02:26.644
We're close, but I need
more time with Bigfoot.

909
01:02:26.646 --> 01:02:28.813
We're closer than we've ever been.

910
01:02:28.815 --> 01:02:30.782
I want you working around the clock.

911
01:02:30.784 --> 01:02:34.855
Nobody rests and nobody goes home
until we've cracked this thing.

912
01:02:35.623 --> 01:02:37.691
Sir?

913
01:02:46.836 --> 01:02:49.268
Greg. Gerry. What's new with you guys?

914
01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:51.204
This guy drinks lattes.

915
01:02:51.206 --> 01:02:54.208
Come on. You promised to let it go.

916
01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:56.379
Well, lah-di-dah.

917
01:03:08.426 --> 01:03:11.026
Are you kidding me?

918
01:03:14.699 --> 01:03:18.201
How are we going to find
him? This place is gigantic!

919
01:03:18.203 --> 01:03:20.438
Shh. Let me concentrate.

920
01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:37.854
How much time do you
need to finish sequencing his DNA?

921
01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:39.592
The ongoing mutations are...

922
01:03:41.661 --> 01:03:44.496
I can't see him. We've got to get closer.

923
01:03:44.498 --> 01:03:46.498
Steve, take out those security cameras.

924
01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:47.565
I'm on it.

925
01:03:47.567 --> 01:03:49.770
Everyone else, come with me.

926
01:04:04.118 --> 01:04:05.821
Piece of junk!

927
01:04:30.982 --> 01:04:32.681
<i>Sir?</i>

928
01:04:32.683 --> 01:04:34.984
Yeah, tech support? There's
something wrong with the system here.

929
01:04:34.986 --> 01:04:36.884
All the monitors are on the fritz.

930
01:04:36.886 --> 01:04:39.489
<i>Have you checked if
they are all plugged in?</i>

931
01:04:39.491 --> 01:04:40.925
Of course they're plugged in!

932
01:04:42.393 --> 01:04:44.126
What do you say we smash it down?

933
01:04:44.128 --> 01:04:46.162
Stealth all the way.

934
01:04:46.164 --> 01:04:50.432
Step aside, kid. Let a
professional show you how it's done.

935
01:04:50.434 --> 01:04:51.935
Where'd you get that mask?

936
01:04:51.937 --> 01:04:55.004
Girl, there's a lot
you don't know about me.

937
01:04:55.006 --> 01:04:58.944
Lick, stick, and cut.

938
01:05:03.416 --> 01:05:04.619
Shoot.

939
01:05:09.188 --> 01:05:12.856
We've got a perimeter breach!

940
01:05:12.858 --> 01:05:16.729
The wrong thing to do here would
be to start pointing fingers.

941
01:05:16.731 --> 01:05:19.332
Careful... Careful... There's
broken glass everywhere.

942
01:05:19.334 --> 01:05:21.533
<i>This is
standard troubleshooting procedure.</i>

943
01:05:21.535 --> 01:05:24.336
<i>Ninety percent of the time,
something is unplugged.</i>

944
01:05:24.338 --> 01:05:28.241
Like I said, everything is plugged in!

945
01:05:33.181 --> 01:05:36.482
Help! Tech support!
Get down here right now!

946
01:05:36.484 --> 01:05:39.923
<i>I'm so sorry, sir, I am in
India. There is nothing I can do.</i>

947
01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.660
<i>Have I been helpful for you today?</i>

948
01:05:46.662 --> 01:05:48.565
<i>Would you be willing
to take a short survey?</i>

949
01:05:50.332 --> 01:05:51.368
There he is.

950
01:05:53.337 --> 01:05:55.136
We'll have to go through that door.

951
01:05:55.138 --> 01:05:56.607
Watch out, Wilbur, they're coming in!

952
01:05:59.176 --> 01:06:00.976
Don't worry. I got it.

953
01:06:00.978 --> 01:06:04.180
What are we gonna do?
How do we get out of here?

954
01:06:04.182 --> 01:06:06.316
Check the lockers for anything we can use.

955
01:06:06.318 --> 01:06:07.883
Take whatever you can carry.

956
01:06:07.885 --> 01:06:10.389
I need more men. Get them down here now!

957
01:06:12.358 --> 01:06:15.593
Jackpot! Does it make me look cool?

958
01:06:15.595 --> 01:06:18.897
Hey, no fair! I want the
flare gun! Me, me, me me, me!

959
01:06:18.899 --> 01:06:20.232
Fine, take it.

960
01:06:26.372 --> 01:06:28.076
What?

961
01:06:33.313 --> 01:06:34.479
What?

962
01:06:34.481 --> 01:06:36.817
Maybe we should try something else.

963
01:06:38.284 --> 01:06:40.252
Yeah, that's more like it!

964
01:06:41.622 --> 01:06:44.492
Watch where you're swinging that thing!

965
01:06:47.194 --> 01:06:48.393
On three.

966
01:06:48.395 --> 01:06:50.296
Okay, guys. It's now or never.

967
01:06:50.298 --> 01:06:51.565
Okay.

968
01:06:51.567 --> 01:06:52.735
One...

969
01:06:53.469 --> 01:06:54.902
Two...

970
01:06:56.404 --> 01:06:57.406
Three!

971
01:07:01.543 --> 01:07:02.511
Fire. Fire!

972
01:07:05.249 --> 01:07:07.184
Keep firing! Keep...!

973
01:07:13.923 --> 01:07:15.491
Gotcha, you little weasel.

974
01:07:15.493 --> 01:07:18.029
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?

975
01:07:22.132 --> 01:07:24.534
Bring it on, suckers!

976
01:07:28.273 --> 01:07:29.241
Ha!

977
01:07:35.213 --> 01:07:36.215
No!

978
01:07:37.048 --> 01:07:39.317
Get your hands off him.

979
01:07:46.592 --> 01:07:48.292
What now?

980
01:07:48.294 --> 01:07:51.965
I'll deal with them. You go
find your dad. Go, Adam, go.

981
01:08:02.842 --> 01:08:03.878
Over there.

982
01:08:26.369 --> 01:08:27.370
Come on, Captain!

983
01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:35.245
Over there!

984
01:08:43.755 --> 01:08:45.589
Whoa, get off me.

985
01:08:50.862 --> 01:08:53.596
Hey, Wilbur, get me up there!

986
01:08:53.598 --> 01:08:56.267
My pleasure. Whoa!

987
01:08:59.204 --> 01:09:01.640
Yee haw!

988
01:09:10.683 --> 01:09:12.082
Whoo-hoo!

989
01:09:13.285 --> 01:09:14.385
- Don't move!
- What?

990
01:09:14.387 --> 01:09:15.519
You're under arrest.

991
01:09:15.521 --> 01:09:17.324
Y'all got to read me my rights.

992
01:09:20.829 --> 01:09:22.828
That is one tough bear.

993
01:09:35.678 --> 01:09:36.944
Dad!

994
01:09:36.946 --> 01:09:38.578
Adam, how did you get in here?

995
01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:41.849
Long story, but don't worry,
I am here to get you out.

996
01:09:41.851 --> 01:09:43.518
It's going to be okay, Adam.

997
01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:44.786
What are you doing?

998
01:09:44.788 --> 01:09:47.121
Everything I did was to keep you safe.

999
01:09:47.123 --> 01:09:50.290
Not a day went by that I
didn't wish I was in your life.

1000
01:09:50.292 --> 01:09:52.094
We've got to hurry. Come on!

1001
01:09:52.096 --> 01:09:54.296
I need you to believe that.

1002
01:09:54.298 --> 01:09:56.598
You've been a naughty, naughty boy, Adam.

1003
01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.301
It's very lucky your
father is a friend of mine,

1004
01:09:59.303 --> 01:10:02.270
and friends forgive and forget.

1005
01:10:02.272 --> 01:10:04.274
You're going to have to catch us first.

1006
01:10:04.276 --> 01:10:05.676
Come on, Dad. Let's run!

1007
01:10:05.678 --> 01:10:07.176
I'm not going with you.

1008
01:10:07.178 --> 01:10:08.944
What?

1009
01:10:08.946 --> 01:10:12.949
I'm staying here. You and your
mother are going to be safe.

1010
01:10:12.951 --> 01:10:14.685
It's better this way.

1011
01:10:14.687 --> 01:10:16.152
What did you do to him?

1012
01:10:16.154 --> 01:10:18.122
He's sick. You're killing him!

1013
01:10:18.124 --> 01:10:22.458
He's here under his own free
will. He can leave at any time.

1014
01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:24.363
I'll be fine. Just go, Adam.

1015
01:10:25.298 --> 01:10:27.030
Don't look so surprised,

1016
01:10:27.032 --> 01:10:29.567
we're partners, your dad and I.

1017
01:10:29.569 --> 01:10:31.702
- I told you we would be.
- Go on, now.

1018
01:10:31.704 --> 01:10:34.740
No! I'm not leaving without you.

1019
01:10:34.742 --> 01:10:36.842
You promised not to hurt him!

1020
01:10:36.844 --> 01:10:38.880
Treat our young guest gently.

1021
01:10:41.083 --> 01:10:44.183
It's time for Daddy to get back to work.

1022
01:10:44.185 --> 01:10:45.587
Take care of your mother.

1023
01:11:03.004 --> 01:11:06.675
I had the most beautiful dream.

1024
01:11:06.677 --> 01:11:09.010
I could take the rings off my tail

1025
01:11:09.012 --> 01:11:12.646
and link them together
like a fancy magician.

1026
01:11:12.648 --> 01:11:14.382
I could be your assistant.

1027
01:11:14.384 --> 01:11:18.053
You could saw me in
half, quarters, pennies,

1028
01:11:18.055 --> 01:11:19.321
whatever spare change you like...

1029
01:11:19.323 --> 01:11:21.557
Whoa, how many darts did you guys have?

1030
01:11:21.559 --> 01:11:25.093
Let's just say that I was over my limit.

1031
01:11:25.095 --> 01:11:28.263
You'll never have
to worry about anything again.

1032
01:11:28.265 --> 01:11:31.938
Take it from me, you're
going to love being rich.

1033
01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:39.808
Man, the kid sold us out.
He took the money and ran.

1034
01:11:39.810 --> 01:11:43.715
Just think of it like he's
away on a business trip,

1035
01:11:43.717 --> 01:11:46.216
working hard to provide for you.

1036
01:11:46.218 --> 01:11:48.985
Except he never comes home
from this business trip.

1037
01:11:48.987 --> 01:11:52.858
Your father is a busy
man. You know how it is.

1038
01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:55.426
Well, business is business, I guess.

1039
01:11:55.428 --> 01:11:56.563
That a boy.

1040
01:11:58.232 --> 01:12:00.699
Stop him! Get the boy.

1041
01:12:00.701 --> 01:12:02.904
Business is business!

1042
01:12:10.211 --> 01:12:13.812
- Don't let it get wet!
- My beautiful hair!

1043
01:12:13.814 --> 01:12:15.714
My toupee!

1044
01:12:19.322 --> 01:12:26.326
Security! Security! Shut down the fire
alarm in sector 4 and open the doors!

1045
01:12:26.328 --> 01:12:30.799
<i>Security, shut down the
fire alarm in sector 4.</i>

1046
01:12:30.801 --> 01:12:31.966
What?

1047
01:12:31.968 --> 01:12:33.904
A... A fire? No.

1048
01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:41.610
<i>Evacuate! Evacuate!</i>

1049
01:12:41.612 --> 01:12:44.979
<i>Please proceed to your nearest
exit in an orderly manner.</i>

1050
01:12:44.981 --> 01:12:47.283
What's wrong with that guy?

1051
01:12:47.285 --> 01:12:51.554
Security, security. Switch
off the alarm right away!

1052
01:12:51.556 --> 01:12:53.656
<i>Evacuate. Evacuate.</i>

1053
01:12:55.094 --> 01:12:58.829
Stop it, stop it, this is a false alarm.

1054
01:12:58.831 --> 01:13:00.631
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

1055
01:13:00.633 --> 01:13:03.299
<i>Please exit the facility at once.</i>

1056
01:13:03.301 --> 01:13:04.702
What are you doing?

1057
01:13:04.704 --> 01:13:05.803
Standard procedure, sir.

1058
01:13:05.805 --> 01:13:08.175
Let me... Argh! ...go!

1059
01:13:13.947 --> 01:13:17.649
Look who's back.
Mister sellout moneybags.

1060
01:13:17.651 --> 01:13:19.617
Did you really think I'd leave you here?

1061
01:13:22.088 --> 01:13:23.322
Get these cages open now. Everybody out.

1062
01:13:23.324 --> 01:13:25.490
Yeah.

1063
01:13:25.492 --> 01:13:27.529
Feel free to start with me.

1064
01:13:32.767 --> 01:13:35.402
I can't believe you're unlocking
all these randoms before me!

1065
01:13:35.404 --> 01:13:37.037
Thank you, my dear.

1066
01:13:37.039 --> 01:13:39.773
Hello there, cowboy.

1067
01:13:39.775 --> 01:13:40.776
What are you in for?

1068
01:13:41.311 --> 01:13:42.411
Murder.

1069
01:13:43.745 --> 01:13:45.613
Just joking. I eat carrots.

1070
01:13:45.615 --> 01:13:47.717
You're funny.

1071
01:13:50.919 --> 01:13:53.053
Tina! Get me out of here!

1072
01:13:53.055 --> 01:13:55.926
This is not the time for
fraternizing with inmates!

1073
01:13:58.328 --> 01:13:59.660
Adam, what are you doing?

1074
01:13:59.662 --> 01:14:01.696
Come on, Dad, I'm breaking you out.

1075
01:14:01.698 --> 01:14:06.669
I told you, I can't go. They'll always
be after me. We'll always be hiding.

1076
01:14:06.671 --> 01:14:08.871
I don't care, as long as we're together.

1077
01:14:08.873 --> 01:14:13.375
No, I won't do that to
you. I'm not leaving.

1078
01:14:13.377 --> 01:14:16.879
If you don't come with me, I'll
tell them I'm a bigfoot too.

1079
01:14:16.881 --> 01:14:18.883
You can't.

1080
01:14:18.885 --> 01:14:21.852
I've got your genes, I've got your crazy
hair. I've got everything they need.

1081
01:14:21.854 --> 01:14:22.919
Adam, no.

1082
01:14:22.921 --> 01:14:25.455
Either we both stay, or we both go.

1083
01:14:25.457 --> 01:14:27.191
It's up to you.

1084
01:14:27.193 --> 01:14:30.464
But I need my dad, and I'm
not leaving here without you.

1085
01:14:33.799 --> 01:14:36.436
You are one stubborn kid.

1086
01:14:38.405 --> 01:14:41.208
I guess I take after my old man.

1087
01:14:45.179 --> 01:14:48.347
Where's Adam? You said
he was right behind us.

1088
01:14:48.349 --> 01:14:50.682
What have you done with my son?

1089
01:14:50.684 --> 01:14:52.784
Calm down, he's on the way.

1090
01:14:52.786 --> 01:14:54.355
As soon as he gets home,
we'll be out of your hair.

1091
01:14:54.357 --> 01:14:57.156
As soon as you leave, I'm calling the cops.

1092
01:14:57.158 --> 01:14:59.459
What are you gonna say?

1093
01:14:59.461 --> 01:15:01.895
"Hello, police? My husband is Bigfoot,

1094
01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:03.964
"and he's been captured
in an evil conspiracy."

1095
01:15:03.966 --> 01:15:06.233
Sounds pretty crazy to me.

1096
01:15:06.235 --> 01:15:08.502
You know, someone with a story like that

1097
01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:10.638
probably isn't fit to raise a kid.

1098
01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:13.407
How dare you. You should
be ashamed of yourself.

1099
01:15:13.409 --> 01:15:16.076
Listen, lady, we're just doing our jobs.

1100
01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:20.416
Now where's the can? You
got a bathroom in this place?

1101
01:15:20.418 --> 01:15:22.820
No, we go in the bushes outside.

1102
01:15:23.987 --> 01:15:25.490
It's upstairs.

1103
01:15:32.496 --> 01:15:35.332
Simpson! Come into
the bathroom, right now!

1104
01:15:35.334 --> 01:15:39.034
That's okay, I'll
wait until you're done.

1105
01:15:39.036 --> 01:15:40.738
Would you get in here?

1106
01:15:42.974 --> 01:15:44.710
What's going on?

1107
01:15:48.313 --> 01:15:49.980
Sir, we're at the house.

1108
01:15:49.982 --> 01:15:52.548
The boy's a bigfoot. We've
got the hair to prove it.

1109
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:55.720
<i>What?
Fantastic! Change of plan, then.</i>

1110
01:15:55.722 --> 01:15:57.390
Roger that.

1111
01:16:07.435 --> 01:16:11.537
That's not very nice. Do you
treat all your guests like this?

1112
01:16:11.539 --> 01:16:13.973
Just the ones that kidnap my son.

1113
01:16:19.147 --> 01:16:21.814
<i>Evacuate, evacuate.</i>

1114
01:16:21.816 --> 01:16:24.351
<i>Time to get your butts in gear.</i>

1115
01:16:24.353 --> 01:16:26.886
<i>Evacuate! Evacuate!</i>

1116
01:16:31.393 --> 01:16:32.729
Follow me, buddy.

1117
01:16:36.232 --> 01:16:40.104
No more hiding. We're shutting
this place down for good.

1118
01:16:59.224 --> 01:17:01.793
No! Come on. Hurry!

1119
01:17:07.633 --> 01:17:09.766
What now?

1120
01:17:09.768 --> 01:17:11.869
There's got to be another way out.

1121
01:17:11.871 --> 01:17:12.838
Dad, up there.

1122
01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:16.575
Let's check it out... Follow me.

1123
01:17:21.915 --> 01:17:26.118
Adam, watch where you step. Stay close.

1124
01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:28.488
Keep on going, I'm right behind you.

1125
01:17:37.465 --> 01:17:38.500
Up there.

1126
01:17:47.944 --> 01:17:50.344
There's no way down. We're trapped.

1127
01:17:50.346 --> 01:17:51.514
No, Dad. Look.

1128
01:17:54.016 --> 01:17:55.018
- Zipline!
- Zipline!

1129
01:18:01.958 --> 01:18:03.224
Aah!

1130
01:18:03.226 --> 01:18:04.227
Shoot.

1131
01:18:08.866 --> 01:18:11.837
One way in, one way out.

1132
01:18:13.904 --> 01:18:14.906
We're going home.

1133
01:18:17.907 --> 01:18:20.746
Let me go, you big oaf.

1134
01:18:22.048 --> 01:18:24.248
So what'll it be?

1135
01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:28.084
Shall we end this little charade
and return you to your cell?

1136
01:18:28.086 --> 01:18:29.986
He's never going back there.

1137
01:18:31.158 --> 01:18:32.126
Dad!

1138
01:18:34.894 --> 01:18:38.964
You silly beast. You lied to me.

1139
01:18:38.966 --> 01:18:43.402
You're not so special. The
boy has everything we need.

1140
01:18:43.404 --> 01:18:46.304
No, please. Leave him alone. You promised.

1141
01:18:46.306 --> 01:18:47.509
It's too late now.

1142
01:18:58.753 --> 01:19:02.521
I would've kept you
both, but I only need one.

1143
01:19:02.523 --> 01:19:03.793
No, please!

1144
01:19:04.859 --> 01:19:05.861
I'm sorry, son.

1145
01:19:08.697 --> 01:19:09.698
No!

1146
01:19:14.370 --> 01:19:15.903
No.

1147
01:19:15.905 --> 01:19:17.605
Argh! You animal!

1148
01:19:17.607 --> 01:19:20.545
Really, it's
you who is the animal.

1149
01:19:23.514 --> 01:19:25.914
I hate to break it to you,

1150
01:19:25.916 --> 01:19:28.083
but that's only a flare gun.

1151
01:19:28.085 --> 01:19:31.187
It won't do you any
good. Now get back inside,

1152
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:32.588
we've got work to do.

1153
01:19:32.590 --> 01:19:35.226
No, you're out of business.

1154
01:19:52.777 --> 01:19:54.012
No!

1155
01:20:20.609 --> 01:20:23.713
Don't just stand there, pull me up!

1156
01:20:28.783 --> 01:20:30.349
No!

1157
01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:33.823
Ooh, that must hurt.

1158
01:20:39.162 --> 01:20:40.329
Dad!

1159
01:20:41.131 --> 01:20:42.231
Dad!

1160
01:20:49.005 --> 01:20:51.976
Please, don't leave me.

1161
01:20:59.216 --> 01:21:02.554
<i>The healing touch, it
all goes with the territory.</i>

1162
01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:31.817
Look at that! He really is a bigfoot.

1163
01:21:31.819 --> 01:21:34.687
You see, you never listen
to me. I told you so!

1164
01:21:34.689 --> 01:21:36.488
Are you kidding?

1165
01:21:58.548 --> 01:21:59.515
Adam?

1166
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:01.518
Dad?

1167
01:22:07.626 --> 01:22:10.125
For the better or for the worse,

1168
01:22:10.127 --> 01:22:12.128
it looks like you're stuck with me now.

1169
01:22:12.130 --> 01:22:15.098
You know, Dad, I'm glad to be a bigfoot.

1170
01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:16.898
Me too.

1171
01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:19.902
I don't know how you did
it, but that was amazing!

1172
01:22:19.904 --> 01:22:23.607
I got to say it, kid, you're the real deal!

1173
01:22:23.609 --> 01:22:26.309
I guess I am. Whoa, watch out guys!

1174
01:22:26.311 --> 01:22:31.650
You... You should have kept
your end of the bargain.

1175
01:22:32.585 --> 01:22:35.521
It did not have to end this way.

1176
01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:43.731
Nobody messes with my family.

1177
01:22:44.831 --> 01:22:46.765
My kinda woman.

1178
01:22:46.767 --> 01:22:48.801
- Mom.
- Honey.

1179
01:22:51.139 --> 01:22:54.405
Hi, sweetheart. It's great to see you.

1180
01:22:54.407 --> 01:22:56.741
- No more hiding.
- No more hiding.

1181
01:22:56.743 --> 01:22:58.212
Look what I found.

1182
01:23:02.916 --> 01:23:08.490
Yo, dudes, metal! Tada da da da da da, yeah!

1183
01:23:16.097 --> 01:23:17.932
My research.

1184
01:23:17.934 --> 01:23:19.401
My lab!

1185
01:23:22.106 --> 01:23:25.376
My time sheet.

1186
01:23:38.356 --> 01:23:41.324
Hey! That hurts.

1187
01:23:41.326 --> 01:23:43.395
Don't you have a snooze button?

1188
01:23:44.996 --> 01:23:47.700
You're gonna be late
for school. Now get up!

1189
01:23:53.906 --> 01:23:56.508
Yeah!

1190
01:23:56.510 --> 01:23:59.246
Good mornin'! Allow me.

1191
01:24:01.247 --> 01:24:02.783
Oops. Sorry.

1192
01:24:04.684 --> 01:24:06.116
Good to go.

1193
01:24:06.118 --> 01:24:07.653
Ew, gross.

1194
01:24:17.531 --> 01:24:19.732
How about a bearskin rug!

1195
01:24:22.469 --> 01:24:24.507
He's so soft.

1196
01:24:32.915 --> 01:24:34.382
Hello, everyone.

1197
01:24:34.384 --> 01:24:37.885
Whoa, Trapper, that's
going to give me nightmares!

1198
01:24:37.887 --> 01:24:40.154
Girls, don't listen to Uncle Adam,

1199
01:24:40.156 --> 01:24:44.593
he's just jealous of how pretty you
made me look. Now who's doing my nails?

1200
01:24:44.595 --> 01:24:47.395
And you thought
you were going to have boys.

1201
01:24:47.397 --> 01:24:49.097
I never said that.

1202
01:24:49.099 --> 01:24:51.435
That raccoon will never change.

1203
01:24:53.135 --> 01:24:55.536
I could get used to this.

1204
01:24:55.538 --> 01:24:58.241
I could definitely get used to this.

1205
01:24:58.243 --> 01:25:03.315
Well, get used to it. We've got a
lot of breakfasts to make up for.

1206
01:25:03.815 --> 01:25:05.747
Ooh, gotta go.

1207
01:25:05.749 --> 01:25:07.282
See you guys tonight.

1208
01:25:07.284 --> 01:25:08.487
Don't forget your lunch.

1209
01:25:09.955 --> 01:25:11.921
Let me guess, meatloaf?

1210
01:25:11.923 --> 01:25:13.457
But of course.

1211
01:25:13.459 --> 01:25:16.594
New house rule. From now
on, Dad does all the cooking.

1212
01:25:16.596 --> 01:25:18.429
You got a deal.

1213
01:25:18.431 --> 01:25:21.836
I, I'm not so sure...

1214
01:25:27.473 --> 01:25:31.508
Well, well, well. What do we have here?

1215
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:34.446
Hey, Tony, what are you
doing here all by yourself?

1216
01:25:34.448 --> 01:25:35.647
Where are your bros?

1217
01:25:38.618 --> 01:25:42.120
Calling in the cavalry. I
guess some things never change.

1218
01:25:42.122 --> 01:25:43.955
Where have you been, mop-top?

1219
01:25:45.027 --> 01:25:46.626
You know what? I like my hair.

1220
01:25:46.628 --> 01:25:48.594
Good for you.

1221
01:25:48.596 --> 01:25:50.429
I'm serious, leave me alone.

1222
01:25:50.431 --> 01:25:52.902
We don't need to fight.
You're better than this.

1223
01:25:54.302 --> 01:25:56.569
No, we're not.

1224
01:25:56.571 --> 01:25:59.340
Okay, you asked for it.

1225
01:26:00.775 --> 01:26:03.344
What are you're going to
do, whistle us to death?

1226
01:26:03.346 --> 01:26:05.549
Just calling in the troops.

1227
01:26:07.315 --> 01:26:10.752
Remember, I gave you a chance to walk away.

1228
01:26:12.089 --> 01:26:15.392
Look what we have here. We're terrified!

1229
01:26:25.769 --> 01:26:27.035
Thanks, Wilbur.

1230
01:26:27.037 --> 01:26:28.771
Just doing my part.

1231
01:26:28.773 --> 01:26:32.074
Girls, Daddy is very proud of you.

1232
01:26:32.076 --> 01:26:33.712
What are you smiling about?

1233
01:26:36.047 --> 01:26:38.952
No. You didn't. Let's check them out.

1234
01:26:56.002 --> 01:26:58.071
Whoa. Don't mess with these girls.

1235
01:26:58.073 --> 01:27:00.907
They take after their old man.

1236
01:27:00.909 --> 01:27:02.875
Now you better get back inside

1237
01:27:02.877 --> 01:27:06.244
before somebody reports a giant
bear terrorizing kids in the city.

1238
01:27:06.246 --> 01:27:07.249
Hi, Adam.

1239
01:27:08.717 --> 01:27:10.184
Hi, there.

1240
01:27:10.186 --> 01:27:11.618
What was that all about?

1241
01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:13.721
Well...

1242
01:27:13.723 --> 01:27:15.889
Do you want to walk to school with me?

1243
01:27:15.891 --> 01:27:17.158
I'll tell you on the way.

1244
01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:19.996
I'd love to. I thought you'd never ask.

1245
01:27:21.063 --> 01:27:22.963
Cool.

1246
01:27:24.567 --> 01:27:25.866
No, not again.

1247
01:27:25.868 --> 01:27:28.902
Whoa, what's with the feet?

1248
01:27:28.904 --> 01:27:32.240
You're really different. I like that.

1249
01:27:32.242 --> 01:27:35.347
Maybe it'd be better
if I switch to sandals.

1250
01:27:36.747 --> 01:27:38.546
We better hurry, we're going to be late.

1251
01:27:38.548 --> 01:27:41.784
Slow down, we've got plenty of time.

1252
01:27:41.786 --> 01:27:43.786
I really do want to hear your story.

1253
01:27:43.788 --> 01:27:46.525
Well, where do I start?

1254
01:27:50.731 --> 01:27:55.831
