00:01:56.586 --> 00:01:58.551
<i>Dr. Harrison, stop.</i>

2
00:01:58.553 --> 00:01:59.820
You can't run forever.

3
00:02:07.697 --> 00:02:09.696
<i>There's no escape, Doctor.</i>

4
00:02:09.698 --> 00:02:11.068
<i>You're coming with us.</i>

5
00:02:17.642 --> 00:02:21.246
Don't use your dart
gun. We got him cornered.

6
00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.922
Argh! We were so close...

7
00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.782
Daddy.

8
00:02:56.784 --> 00:02:59.319
Daddy.

9
00:03:23.313 --> 00:03:24.946
Adam Harrison!

10
00:03:24.948 --> 00:03:26.882
Yes, sir?

11
00:03:26.884 --> 00:03:29.017
No sleeping in detention.

12
00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.588
Use this time for something productive.

13
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.961
What?

14
00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.198
What's going on back there?

15
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.699
That's disgusting!

16
00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:46.701
Adam, what's the problem?

17
00:03:46.703 --> 00:03:49.842
It looks like someone stuck
six packs of gum in my hair.

18
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.342
I didn't see nothing.

19
00:03:53.344 --> 00:03:54.644
Tony,

20
00:03:54.646 --> 00:03:56.379
go to the office.

21
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:57.916
Not again!

22
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.326
You're dead, snitch!

23
00:04:22.243 --> 00:04:25.213
Holy crap, what's happening to me?

24
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.869
Look at his shoes!

25
00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:49.707
What... What?

26
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:55.943
Spaz alert.

27
00:04:55.945 --> 00:04:57.780
He used to be in my History class.

28
00:04:57.782 --> 00:04:59.114
That's why I changed classes.

29
00:04:59.116 --> 00:05:01.420
He's got like no friends.

30
00:05:03.588 --> 00:05:05.988
Hey, Adam. Are you okay?

31
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.592
Don't run, I don't bite.

32
00:05:09.526 --> 00:05:11.394
Well, look who it is.

33
00:05:11.396 --> 00:05:13.229
How ya doing, snitch?

34
00:05:13.231 --> 00:05:14.833
Leave me alone.

35
00:05:24.511 --> 00:05:27.278
Hey there, mop-top, whatcha doin'?

36
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.614
Are you on your way to
the janitor's closet?

37
00:05:29.616 --> 00:05:31.482
'Cause you look like a mop!

38
00:05:31.484 --> 00:05:33.818
Good one!

39
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.485
Seriously, that counts as a good one?

40
00:05:35.487 --> 00:05:36.625
Give me a break!

41
00:05:37.324 --> 00:05:38.589
Good one!

42
00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:40.495
That's a good one.

43
00:05:41.495 --> 00:05:43.128
Get off me!

44
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.163
What? You gonna rat me out again?

45
00:05:45.165 --> 00:05:48.268
Hard to say. It depends
on the circumstances.

46
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.568
Wrong answer, snitch!

47
00:05:52.274 --> 00:05:53.509
Stop!

48
00:05:55.678 --> 00:05:57.010
Okay, you've had enough.

49
00:05:57.012 --> 00:05:59.015
Here, let me help you.

50
00:06:01.785 --> 00:06:04.087
Look at his shoes! What a freak!

51
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.490
Hey, you forgot your backpack!

52
00:06:09.626 --> 00:06:11.526
Cha-ching! Two points!

53
00:06:14.664 --> 00:06:15.966
Jerks...

54
00:06:21.371 --> 00:06:23.671
It was those boys again wasn't it?

55
00:06:23.673 --> 00:06:25.975
No, I told you. I was playing soccer

56
00:06:25.977 --> 00:06:28.078
with my friends and the
ball hit me in the face.

57
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.348
Yeah? What friends
of yours play soccer?

58
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.650
The British ones...

59
00:06:33.652 --> 00:06:36.387
My mates. But they call soccer "football."

60
00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:39.490
Do they? And how did this happen?

61
00:06:39.492 --> 00:06:41.659
Soccer can be a dangerous sport.

62
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:44.060
Adam, quit messing around.

63
00:06:44.062 --> 00:06:46.063
What are we going to do about this?

64
00:06:46.065 --> 00:06:48.232
Either we chop it out, or we chew it out.

65
00:06:48.234 --> 00:06:49.667
I vote chew.

66
00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:52.205
I vote chop.

67
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.542
Turn around.

68
00:06:59.845 --> 00:07:02.717
You had such nice, long hair.

69
00:07:19.067 --> 00:07:21.604
At least they can't make
fun of my hair anymore.

70
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:46.430
Holy crap!

71
00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:51.100
Adam, You're gonna be late!

72
00:07:51.102 --> 00:07:53.468
I'll be down in a minute!

73
00:07:59.945 --> 00:08:01.312
Adam...

74
00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:03.483
That's not gonna work.

75
00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:07.183
What's taking so long?

76
00:08:07.185 --> 00:08:08.752
Are you all right?

77
00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:10.355
I'm fine!

78
00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:12.322
I guess your meatloaf didn't agree with me.

79
00:08:12.324 --> 00:08:14.592
I thought you loved my meatloaf.

80
00:08:14.594 --> 00:08:17.628
Love is a strong word. I like it.

81
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.500
No, like's too strong.

82
00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:22.501
Hey, I hate your meatloaf.

83
00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:23.734
What?

84
00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:25.404
Listen, my meatloaf is...

85
00:08:25.406 --> 00:08:27.072
Adam.

86
00:08:27.074 --> 00:08:29.108
- What?
- That hat...

87
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.776
What about it?

88
00:08:30.778 --> 00:08:32.814
That was your father's.

89
00:08:40.322 --> 00:08:42.188
Sorry.

90
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.524
Why are you sorry?

91
00:08:43.526 --> 00:08:45.292
I dunno.

92
00:08:45.294 --> 00:08:48.428
He died. I didn't mean to make you sad.

93
00:08:49.967 --> 00:08:51.999
He was a great man.

94
00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:53.504
I wish I knew him.

95
00:08:56.439 --> 00:08:59.840
I did a sloppy job on your hair.

96
00:08:59.842 --> 00:09:03.045
I must have been more tired than I thought.

97
00:09:03.047 --> 00:09:04.746
Here, let's put this back on.

98
00:09:04.748 --> 00:09:06.050
It looks good on you.

99
00:09:08.386 --> 00:09:10.986
Now hurry up, you're going
to be late for school.

100
00:09:10.988 --> 00:09:13.390
I can't believe you don't like my meatloaf.

101
00:09:13.392 --> 00:09:15.158
I'll let you in on a secret, Mom.

102
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.396
Nobody likes your meatloaf.

103
00:09:19.665 --> 00:09:23.199
Okay. Well, enjoy your lunch.

104
00:09:23.201 --> 00:09:24.669
It's meatloaf, isn't it?

105
00:09:24.671 --> 00:09:26.607
Could be.

106
00:09:33.514 --> 00:09:36.647
<i>All powerful men
have one thing in common.</i>

107
00:09:36.649 --> 00:09:39.518
Great hair.

108
00:09:41.154 --> 00:09:43.654
HairCo toupees have been worn in secret

109
00:09:43.656 --> 00:09:45.426
by some of the greatest men in history.

110
00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.865
But you're not here to
be a part of our past,

111
00:09:52.867 --> 00:09:55.402
you're here to be part of the future.

112
00:09:55.404 --> 00:09:58.207
Make no mistake, gentlemen,
hair is a growth business.

113
00:10:04.814 --> 00:10:08.251
I'm afraid we'll need to
ask you for your cameras.

114
00:10:25.836 --> 00:10:28.838
Mr. Kobayashi, I must insist.

115
00:10:34.979 --> 00:10:36.448
Ooh.

116
00:10:39.751 --> 00:10:42.920
This is where the magic happens.

117
00:10:42.922 --> 00:10:46.891
The future isn't toupees, no, no, no.

118
00:10:46.893 --> 00:10:49.363
The future lies in growing real hair.

119
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.399
We're not talking about
embarrassing hair plugs,

120
00:10:55.401 --> 00:10:58.669
useless scalp massagers, or fancy shampoo.

121
00:10:58.671 --> 00:11:01.274
We're talking about genetic engineering.

122
00:11:01.276 --> 00:11:04.510
State of the art DNA manipulation.

123
00:11:04.512 --> 00:11:06.611
We're on the verge of a major breakthrough

124
00:11:06.613 --> 00:11:09.817
that will change the lives of
hundreds of millions of people...

125
00:11:12.487 --> 00:11:15.723
And make us a fortune in the process.

126
00:11:31.508 --> 00:11:35.676
Dr. Billingsley is our head of
experimental research and development.

127
00:11:35.678 --> 00:11:39.981
Here comes one of
our eager young interns.

128
00:11:39.983 --> 00:11:42.850
Dr. Billingsley?

129
00:11:42.852 --> 00:11:44.688
I'm getting college cedit for this, right?

130
00:11:45.322 --> 00:11:47.188
Of course.

131
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.928
Okay. I'll just need you to
sign my work experience time sheet.

132
00:11:50.862 --> 00:11:52.495
Stand on the "X."

133
00:11:52.497 --> 00:11:54.362
Hold on, you're not
going to shoot me with...

134
00:11:55.667 --> 00:11:57.068
Ouch!

135
00:12:01.039 --> 00:12:02.539
Whoa.

136
00:12:04.977 --> 00:12:06.477
Ooh.

137
00:12:06.479 --> 00:12:09.246
Now, you may experience a
slight burning sensation.

138
00:12:09.248 --> 00:12:10.983
But don't worry about it.

139
00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.822
Help me!

140
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.460
As you can see,

141
00:12:22.462 --> 00:12:24.896
we're still perfecting the formula.

142
00:12:24.898 --> 00:12:28.733
Once we do, people will
pay anything for it.

143
00:12:28.735 --> 00:12:32.437
The real money is in big hair.

144
00:12:40.183 --> 00:12:43.517
Reduce fluoroantimonic
acid by five percent.

145
00:12:46.688 --> 00:12:49.224
We have a no
fighting policy at this school,

146
00:12:50.359 --> 00:12:51.625
zero tolerance.

147
00:12:51.627 --> 00:12:54.361
You fight, you're suspended!

148
00:12:54.363 --> 00:12:56.463
You're suspended!

149
00:12:56.465 --> 00:12:59.067
Do you hear me? Suspended!

150
00:12:59.069 --> 00:13:02.070
You're so funny.

151
00:13:02.072 --> 00:13:04.575
Hey, you better watch your back, snitch.

152
00:13:09.613 --> 00:13:12.948
Adam Harrison.

153
00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:16.518
I believe this belongs to you.

154
00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.689
Nametag was on the inside.

155
00:13:19.691 --> 00:13:21.123
Thank you, sir!

156
00:13:21.125 --> 00:13:24.661
Don't be throwing it into
basketball hoops anymore.

157
00:13:24.663 --> 00:13:27.931
What? Why would I throw my
own bag into a basketball hoop?

158
00:13:27.933 --> 00:13:31.170
Who knows why you kids do anything?

159
00:13:32.239 --> 00:13:36.006
Adam, you are what we call a...

160
00:13:36.008 --> 00:13:38.976
Mildred.

161
00:13:38.978 --> 00:13:43.816
What are we saying
instead of spazoid these days?

162
00:13:43.818 --> 00:13:46.951
Normally challenged, sir.

163
00:13:46.953 --> 00:13:48.687
And...

164
00:13:48.689 --> 00:13:51.624
How would I say "friendless loser"?

165
00:13:51.626 --> 00:13:55.861
Mid-level
acquaintance deficiency.

166
00:13:57.531 --> 00:14:02.469
Adam, you have mid-level
acquaintance deficiency.

167
00:14:02.471 --> 00:14:04.271
Do they make a pill for that?

168
00:14:04.273 --> 00:14:06.173
No, sir.

169
00:14:06.175 --> 00:14:11.011
Apparently, there's
nothing we can do for you.

170
00:14:11.013 --> 00:14:14.047
This acting out needs to stop.

171
00:14:14.049 --> 00:14:15.416
But, sir...

172
00:14:15.418 --> 00:14:17.551
We have a no fighting
policy at this school.

173
00:14:17.553 --> 00:14:21.522
Zero tolerance. You
fight, you're suspended.

174
00:14:21.524 --> 00:14:22.957
Getting beat up counts as fighting?

175
00:14:22.959 --> 00:14:27.095
A fist can't punch without
a face to receive it.

176
00:14:27.097 --> 00:14:29.831
No fighting means no fighting.

177
00:14:29.833 --> 00:14:31.166
And, Adam?

178
00:14:31.168 --> 00:14:33.436
Yes, sir?

179
00:14:33.438 --> 00:14:37.171
We have zero tolerance on hats.

180
00:14:37.173 --> 00:14:39.842
No hats in school.

181
00:14:42.546 --> 00:14:44.347
And get a haircut.

182
00:14:44.349 --> 00:14:45.517
What...

183
00:15:05.439 --> 00:15:08.540
Hey, Harrison, you got me suspended!

184
00:15:08.542 --> 00:15:10.843
You should be happy. You hate school.

185
00:15:10.845 --> 00:15:12.344
My dad's going to kill me.

186
00:15:12.346 --> 00:15:14.379
He's got a 10 strikes policy,

187
00:15:14.381 --> 00:15:15.683
and this is strike 10.

188
00:15:18.919 --> 00:15:22.656
Come on, guys, you heard Principal
Jones. He said no fighting.

189
00:15:22.658 --> 00:15:25.825
He said no fighting on school property.

190
00:15:28.331 --> 00:15:29.931
How do I look?

191
00:15:29.933 --> 00:15:31.565
You look like stupid Adam.

192
00:15:31.567 --> 00:15:33.099
This hat sucks.

193
00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:36.972
Stop!

194
00:15:38.342 --> 00:15:40.676
That's it, you're dead!

195
00:15:40.678 --> 00:15:42.476
Come on, let's get him!

196
00:15:56.661 --> 00:15:58.727
Come on, get him!

197
00:15:58.729 --> 00:16:00.596
Don't let him get away.

198
00:16:14.146 --> 00:16:16.815
Okay, guys, come on. You've had your fun.

199
00:16:16.817 --> 00:16:19.450
Don't you know how this works?

200
00:16:19.452 --> 00:16:20.884
We got him, boys!

201
00:16:20.886 --> 00:16:22.286
This is the fun part.

202
00:16:22.288 --> 00:16:24.488
Get off me!

203
00:16:32.466 --> 00:16:33.534
What the...

204
00:16:37.405 --> 00:16:38.774
Come on!

205
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.286
What is happening to me?

206
00:16:53.288 --> 00:16:54.490
No...

207
00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.896
You gotta come out sometime.

208
00:17:00.497 --> 00:17:02.934
Yeah, and when you do, we'll be waiting.

209
00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:13.308
It's Friday. He
could be in there all weekend.

210
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:16.546
Are we really gonna
wait here for three days?

211
00:17:16.548 --> 00:17:18.147
Nah. Forget him.

212
00:17:18.149 --> 00:17:20.219
Let's go bug the goats at the petting zoo.

213
00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:33.495
Were you ever going to tell me?

214
00:18:33.497 --> 00:18:36.632
Adam! You startled me.

215
00:18:36.634 --> 00:18:38.834
You said Dad was dead!

216
00:18:38.836 --> 00:18:42.506
- Adam...
- If he's dead, why is he writing letters to you?

217
00:18:42.508 --> 00:18:44.842
This one is from two weeks ago!

218
00:18:44.844 --> 00:18:46.376
"Dear Shelly, I'm sorry to hear

219
00:18:46.378 --> 00:18:48.377
"Adam is having a hard time at school."

220
00:18:48.379 --> 00:18:50.213
- Really?
- It's not what you think.

221
00:18:50.215 --> 00:18:52.183
You didn't think I'd want to meet him?

222
00:18:52.185 --> 00:18:53.651
You thought you could keep him to yourself?

223
00:18:53.653 --> 00:18:58.122
Adam, your dad is alive.

224
00:18:58.124 --> 00:18:59.424
That's all I can tell you.

225
00:18:59.426 --> 00:19:02.091
- Are you kidding me?
- I know it's hard,

226
00:19:02.093 --> 00:19:03.628
but you've got to trust me.

227
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.263
Trust you! You're a liar!

228
00:19:06.265 --> 00:19:09.001
You've been lying to me
every day of my whole life!

229
00:19:09.003 --> 00:19:11.136
Adam, please...

230
00:19:11.138 --> 00:19:13.672
I thought you were the
one person I could trust,

231
00:19:13.674 --> 00:19:15.310
but you're just like everybody else.

232
00:19:17.711 --> 00:19:19.678
I hate you!

233
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.717
Adam, no, please...

234
00:20:09.067 --> 00:20:11.401
Hey, kid. You okay?

235
00:20:11.403 --> 00:20:13.202
Just trying to get home.

236
00:20:13.204 --> 00:20:15.739
Ain't you a little young to be hitchhiking?

237
00:20:15.741 --> 00:20:19.075
I'm a little young to be
stranded at the side of the road,

238
00:20:19.077 --> 00:20:21.612
catching a cold in the pouring rain.

239
00:20:21.614 --> 00:20:24.348
Yeah. I guess so. How far you goin'?

240
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.950
Route 89.

241
00:20:26.952 --> 00:20:29.454
What? Are you kidding?
That's 100 miles from here.

242
00:20:29.456 --> 00:20:30.989
So can you take me?

243
00:20:30.991 --> 00:20:33.694
It's getting
awfully cold out here.

244
00:20:35.095 --> 00:20:36.494
I don't know...

245
00:20:36.496 --> 00:20:38.163
Thanks, I really appreciate it.

246
00:20:38.165 --> 00:20:40.600
Hey, I don't remember sayin' I'd take you.

247
00:20:40.602 --> 00:20:42.468
Come on. You'd hate yourself

248
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:46.271
if I died of pneumonia
and it was all your fault.

249
00:20:47.574 --> 00:20:49.043
All right! Close the door.

250
00:21:01.456 --> 00:21:05.093
Adam? Adam, are you awake?

251
00:21:05.095 --> 00:21:06.796
Can we talk about this?

252
00:21:11.601 --> 00:21:13.204
Adam?

253
00:21:16.607 --> 00:21:18.544
No, no, no!

254
00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:27.649
Well, you don't see many
forests like this anymore.

255
00:21:27.651 --> 00:21:32.322
You walk two weeks in any
direction, and all you'd see is trees.

256
00:21:32.324 --> 00:21:35.725
I'm telling you, you wouldn't want
to get turned around out here, kid.

257
00:21:35.727 --> 00:21:37.596
No, you wouldn't.

258
00:21:38.663 --> 00:21:41.332
Well, it looks like...

259
00:21:41.334 --> 00:21:43.770
Yes, it's here! This is it!

260
00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:47.705
This is it?

261
00:21:47.707 --> 00:21:50.110
I didn't know people
actually lived out here.

262
00:21:51.377 --> 00:21:54.381
Yep, home sweet home.

263
00:21:56.349 --> 00:21:59.986
Home sweet home? Where's your house?

264
00:21:59.988 --> 00:22:03.389
My House... My house is
over there... Back a ways.

265
00:22:04.492 --> 00:22:06.428
Anyway, thanks. See ya.

266
00:22:07.863 --> 00:22:10.833
Okay. Take care of yourself, kid.

267
00:22:15.671 --> 00:22:17.007
Hello?

268
00:22:18.841 --> 00:22:20.743
Hello?

269
00:22:42.935 --> 00:22:46.338
Where'd you go? Little squirrel dude?

270
00:22:48.439 --> 00:22:50.575
Hey, wait! Come back!

271
00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.711
That's not fair!

272
00:23:14.368 --> 00:23:17.506
Walk two weeks in any direction
and all you'll see is trees.

273
00:23:25.746 --> 00:23:27.082
Wow.

274
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:30.449
Hello?

275
00:23:33.822 --> 00:23:36.025
Whoo!

276
00:23:42.531 --> 00:23:45.335
Hello? Somebody there?

277
00:23:47.837 --> 00:23:50.373
This isn't funny. Who's there?

278
00:24:02.286 --> 00:24:03.388
Whoa.

279
00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:22.708
Whoa!

280
00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:27.180
Holy cow! What in the heck was that?

281
00:24:31.784 --> 00:24:33.885
Well, I'll be...

282
00:24:35.755 --> 00:24:40.025
No service? Come on, you piece of junk!

283
00:24:40.027 --> 00:24:43.029
Stupid smartphone!

284
00:24:45.532 --> 00:24:48.001
<i>911,
what's your emergency?</i>

285
00:24:48.003 --> 00:24:51.170
My emergency is I done saw a bigfoot!

286
00:24:51.172 --> 00:24:53.573
I got the whole thing on my dashboard cam.

287
00:24:53.575 --> 00:24:58.378
<i>Bigfoot? Sir, this line is for
emergencies, not for prank calls.</i>

288
00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.716
Hello?

289
00:25:00.282 --> 00:25:01.916
Hello?

290
00:25:01.918 --> 00:25:05.255
Dang blame it, somebody's
got to believe me.

291
00:25:11.094 --> 00:25:13.360
National Enquirer,
<i>how can I help you?</i>

292
00:25:13.362 --> 00:25:15.863
Don't hang up. You gotta believe me.

293
00:25:15.865 --> 00:25:19.267
I'm calling 'cause I saw a real bigfoot.

294
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:21.203
<i>Please hold, and
I'll put you through</i>

295
00:25:21.205 --> 00:25:23.742
<i>to Hairy Monsters,
Swampthings, and UFOs.</i>

296
00:25:25.109 --> 00:25:26.376
Bigfoot?

297
00:25:26.378 --> 00:25:28.377
Yes. Bigfoot.

298
00:25:28.379 --> 00:25:32.115
It's a dead end. We gave up the
search for Bigfoot 10 years ago.

299
00:25:32.117 --> 00:25:35.084
With all due respect, if this
thing is real, we have to have it.

300
00:25:35.086 --> 00:25:37.419
It's the genetic bridge
we've been looking for.

301
00:25:37.421 --> 00:25:43.160
No, no. I'm not wasting a
fortune on another wild goose chase.

302
00:25:43.162 --> 00:25:46.331
Think of the hair growth
potential locked in that DNA.

303
00:25:46.333 --> 00:25:49.467
No more sprays. No more toupees.

304
00:25:49.469 --> 00:25:51.102
Just real hair.

305
00:25:51.104 --> 00:25:54.139
Come on, Billingsley. You're a scientist.

306
00:25:54.141 --> 00:25:57.977
What makes you so sure this
isn't just another hoax?

307
00:25:57.979 --> 00:25:59.577
Looking at the kid in this photo,

308
00:25:59.579 --> 00:26:01.448
could there be any other conclusion?

309
00:26:07.122 --> 00:26:09.654
Is that who I think it is?

310
00:26:09.656 --> 00:26:11.324
We think so.

311
00:26:11.326 --> 00:26:14.094
Then I only have one more question...

312
00:26:14.096 --> 00:26:16.866
Who took this photo?

313
00:26:18.834 --> 00:26:21.068
So, sugar, you say you saw Bigfoot?

314
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.738
- Yes, ma'am.
- And it's going to be in the paper?

315
00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.173
- That's what they said.
- Ooh! You going to be famous.

316
00:26:26.175 --> 00:26:29.845
It's so exciting. Nothing
ever happens up here.

317
00:26:29.847 --> 00:26:31.382
This is going to be good for business.

318
00:26:32.683 --> 00:26:35.051
What's that?

319
00:26:38.989 --> 00:26:40.355
What did I tell you?

320
00:26:40.357 --> 00:26:41.657
- Teddy!
- What?

321
00:26:41.659 --> 00:26:43.291
Raise the prices!

322
00:26:43.293 --> 00:26:45.560
It happened right here.

323
00:26:45.562 --> 00:26:47.030
Check out them skids.

324
00:26:47.032 --> 00:26:50.332
I hit the brakes so hard,
I almost flipped my rig!

325
00:26:50.334 --> 00:26:51.769
Sir...

326
00:26:52.837 --> 00:26:54.407
We got something.

327
00:27:00.678 --> 00:27:01.747
Hello?

328
00:27:02.582 --> 00:27:04.050
Mrs. Harrison?

329
00:27:12.625 --> 00:27:13.826
Check the house.

330
00:27:35.851 --> 00:27:37.350
I think we got something.

331
00:27:37.352 --> 00:27:39.354
Car's gone. No sign of the mother.

332
00:27:54.238 --> 00:27:56.438
Stay away from me! Help!

333
00:28:00.109 --> 00:28:02.611
Don't come any closer!

334
00:28:02.613 --> 00:28:04.947
What... What are you?

335
00:28:04.949 --> 00:28:06.415
Well, I'm...

336
00:28:06.417 --> 00:28:08.049
I'm not sure how to break this to you...

337
00:28:08.051 --> 00:28:10.452
But I'm your dad.

338
00:28:10.454 --> 00:28:13.056
Dad? No, you're not!

339
00:28:13.058 --> 00:28:15.959
Where is he? What did you
do with him? Did you eat him?

340
00:28:15.961 --> 00:28:19.230
No, I promise, Adam. I'm your dad.

341
00:28:19.232 --> 00:28:23.299
Stop saying that! And back off!

342
00:28:23.301 --> 00:28:26.703
Ooh, easy, killer. Don't twig me to death.

343
00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:28.574
Calm down, you have nothing to fear.

344
00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:30.975
Where did you get these?

345
00:28:30.977 --> 00:28:32.310
Your mother sent them to me.

346
00:28:32.312 --> 00:28:33.980
I hate this picture.

347
00:28:35.949 --> 00:28:37.549
- That's you?
- Yep.

348
00:28:37.551 --> 00:28:39.885
It's you, me, and your mom.

349
00:28:39.887 --> 00:28:42.487
You were six months old.

350
00:28:42.489 --> 00:28:43.789
Man...

351
00:28:43.791 --> 00:28:45.658
My dad is Bigfoot?

352
00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.927
- Yep.
- Could my life get any worse?

353
00:28:48.929 --> 00:28:52.432
"Hey, Adam, your dad's famous,
but not like a rock star,

354
00:28:52.434 --> 00:28:56.035
"more like a hideous beast
that hides in the forest."

355
00:28:56.037 --> 00:28:58.004
Hideous? That's a bit strong.

356
00:28:58.006 --> 00:29:00.441
Are you kidding? You're a monster.

357
00:29:00.443 --> 00:29:01.774
I can see why you ran away.

358
00:29:01.776 --> 00:29:05.044
Whoa. I didn't leave because I'm a bigfoot.

359
00:29:05.046 --> 00:29:07.515
I left because I was being hunted.

360
00:29:07.517 --> 00:29:09.350
- Hunted?
- You see,

361
00:29:09.352 --> 00:29:13.388
a pharmaceutical company wanted
to turn me into a lab rat.

362
00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:16.358
I left to protect you and your mother.

363
00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:19.261
We didn't tell you for your own safety.

364
00:29:19.263 --> 00:29:20.732
What do you mean, a lab rat?

365
00:29:21.998 --> 00:29:23.966
Does your mom know you're out here?

366
00:29:23.968 --> 00:29:25.834
Yeah. She gave me the address.

367
00:29:25.836 --> 00:29:27.535
She told me to come out here...

368
00:29:27.537 --> 00:29:29.037
Alone.

369
00:29:29.039 --> 00:29:30.940
Adam, you're lying to me.

370
00:29:30.942 --> 00:29:33.308
You and mom have been
lying to me my entire life.

371
00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:35.010
We had no choice.

372
00:29:35.012 --> 00:29:37.514
You have no idea how
hard it was on both of us.

373
00:29:37.516 --> 00:29:39.149
What about me?

374
00:29:39.151 --> 00:29:42.620
It broke my heart that I couldn't
be there when you needed me.

375
00:29:42.622 --> 00:29:45.155
Adam, this is serious.

376
00:29:45.157 --> 00:29:46.489
Tell me how you found me.

377
00:29:46.491 --> 00:29:48.258
I found your letters.

378
00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.196
You took a big risk coming here.

379
00:29:51.431 --> 00:29:52.865
Your mom must be worried sick.

380
00:30:05.779 --> 00:30:07.779
- What's going on?
- Just a routine check.

381
00:30:07.781 --> 00:30:10.151
Routine? It doesn't look that way to me.

382
00:30:10.918 --> 00:30:12.218
Are you Shelly Harrison?

383
00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:15.387
What? Are you a police officer?

384
00:30:15.389 --> 00:30:17.856
I'm going to have to ask you to turn off
your engine and step out of the vehicle.

385
00:30:17.858 --> 00:30:19.428
Okay.

386
00:30:23.064 --> 00:30:24.932
Ma'am, it's futile.

387
00:30:24.934 --> 00:30:26.935
I suggest you get out of the car.

388
00:30:28.604 --> 00:30:30.771
She sent me everything.

389
00:30:30.773 --> 00:30:33.575
I couldn't get enough of
it. She's so proud of you.

390
00:30:33.577 --> 00:30:35.542
I always thought Mom threw these out.

391
00:30:35.544 --> 00:30:37.078
Not a single one of them.

392
00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.613
So what about me?

393
00:30:38.615 --> 00:30:41.515
Am I gonna be... Like you?

394
00:30:41.517 --> 00:30:44.119
No. You've got nothing to worry about.

395
00:30:44.121 --> 00:30:45.620
You're already 13...

396
00:30:45.622 --> 00:30:47.522
- So what?
- Well...

397
00:30:47.524 --> 00:30:49.157
You'd have symptoms by now.

398
00:30:49.159 --> 00:30:51.593
You mean like hair
that grows a foot overnight?

399
00:30:51.595 --> 00:30:53.662
Feet that blow through
the ends of my shoes?

400
00:30:53.664 --> 00:30:54.967
That kind of thing?

401
00:30:55.935 --> 00:30:58.068
I'm going to be a monster?

402
00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:00.070
It's not so bad.

403
00:31:00.072 --> 00:31:01.905
How is it not so bad?

404
00:31:01.907 --> 00:31:04.942
Spending the rest of my life
hiding in the forest like an animal?

405
00:31:04.944 --> 00:31:07.912
Slow down. What else do you have?

406
00:31:07.914 --> 00:31:11.849
The hair thing, the feet.
What about your ears?

407
00:31:11.851 --> 00:31:15.620
When your adrenaline's up,
does your hearing change?

408
00:31:15.622 --> 00:31:17.621
Sometimes it gets super loud.

409
00:31:17.623 --> 00:31:19.358
Like a migraine or something.

410
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.293
When's the last time you shaved your hands?

411
00:31:21.295 --> 00:31:22.628
What? Ew! Never!

412
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:23.794
But you shave your back?

413
00:31:23.796 --> 00:31:25.630
No. I don't shave anything.

414
00:31:25.632 --> 00:31:29.435
This is amazing. My hands
and back are where it started.

415
00:31:29.437 --> 00:31:33.840
By the time I was 12, I was waxing
my back every weekend with duct tape.

416
00:31:33.842 --> 00:31:35.641
But you're different.

417
00:31:35.643 --> 00:31:37.744
It's like you've got all the
good stuff, but none of the fur.

418
00:31:37.746 --> 00:31:40.080
How is any of this "good stuff"?

419
00:31:40.082 --> 00:31:43.351
There's a lot of good
things about being a bigfoot.

420
00:31:43.353 --> 00:31:45.956
You're standing on that leg, aren't you?

421
00:32:06.877 --> 00:32:09.345
You... You fixed my leg.

422
00:32:09.347 --> 00:32:10.913
How is that possible?

423
00:32:10.915 --> 00:32:14.317
The healing touch, fast
growing hair, big feet...

424
00:32:14.319 --> 00:32:16.184
It all goes with the territory.

425
00:32:16.186 --> 00:32:18.320
Holy moly. What are you?

426
00:32:18.322 --> 00:32:20.156
Some kind of hairy wizard?

427
00:32:20.158 --> 00:32:22.992
Ha. Nothing that exciting.

428
00:32:22.994 --> 00:32:25.497
We've got to find out what else you can do.

429
00:32:26.298 --> 00:32:27.599
Hang on to this.

430
00:32:28.868 --> 00:32:30.035
What's it do?

431
00:32:39.712 --> 00:32:41.115
Whoo-hoo!

432
00:32:45.486 --> 00:32:46.752
Whoo-hoo!

433
00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:56.998
Whoa!

434
00:33:06.275 --> 00:33:09.813
Whoa!

435
00:33:16.318 --> 00:33:17.753
What's going on? It hurts!

436
00:33:24.594 --> 00:33:26.461
Just relax...

437
00:33:26.463 --> 00:33:29.264
That was so irresponsible!
You could've killed me!

438
00:33:29.266 --> 00:33:31.266
It's the adrenaline.

439
00:33:31.268 --> 00:33:33.303
Calm down.

440
00:33:33.305 --> 00:33:35.770
Take a deep breath.

441
00:33:35.772 --> 00:33:38.476
That's it. And listen.

442
00:33:44.884 --> 00:33:47.284
Whoa. It's a woodpecker.

443
00:33:47.286 --> 00:33:48.654
Focus over there.

444
00:33:58.199 --> 00:34:00.265
That's a... What do you call it?

445
00:34:00.267 --> 00:34:02.768
- A geyser.
- It's like I can see it.

446
00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:04.769
The sound makes a picture in your head.

447
00:34:04.771 --> 00:34:08.542
Dolphins and bats have something
similar called echolocation.

448
00:34:09.243 --> 00:34:10.809
Pretty cool?

449
00:34:10.811 --> 00:34:14.012
I guess. Well, Batman's cool...

450
00:34:14.014 --> 00:34:15.446
Dolphinman, not so much.

451
00:34:15.448 --> 00:34:17.549
And your feet... Tell me you've tried them?

452
00:34:17.551 --> 00:34:18.819
Ditch the shoes, buddy.

453
00:34:22.357 --> 00:34:23.857
What?

454
00:34:23.859 --> 00:34:25.024
It's cold.

455
00:34:25.026 --> 00:34:27.994
Try to keep up.

456
00:34:27.996 --> 00:34:29.963
- Whoo-hoo!
- Wait!

457
00:34:46.015 --> 00:34:47.282
Whoo-hoo!

458
00:34:47.284 --> 00:34:49.285
This is amazing!

459
00:34:49.287 --> 00:34:50.852
Feels good, doesn't it?

460
00:34:50.854 --> 00:34:53.224
Yeah! It's the greatest feeling in the...

461
00:34:57.361 --> 00:34:58.930
Whoo-hoo!

462
00:35:05.569 --> 00:35:07.069
Whoo!

463
00:35:10.709 --> 00:35:11.878
Whoo!

464
00:35:17.016 --> 00:35:18.718
Whoo-hoo!!

465
00:35:19.251 --> 00:35:20.919
Whoo...

466
00:35:20.921 --> 00:35:22.455
Ouch, buddy..

467
00:35:22.457 --> 00:35:24.924
I'm so sorry. I should've warned you.

468
00:35:24.926 --> 00:35:28.527
You've gotta avoid smashing
head first into the trees.

469
00:35:30.598 --> 00:35:33.099
I think I'm done with
bigfoot lessons for the day.

470
00:35:33.101 --> 00:35:34.566
There's one more thing.

471
00:35:34.568 --> 00:35:36.570
Does it involve smashing
head first into anything?

472
00:35:36.572 --> 00:35:39.271
Nope. I can talk to animals.

473
00:35:39.273 --> 00:35:40.438
Are you kidding?

474
00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.874
Just watch.

475
00:35:41.876 --> 00:35:43.576
Hey, Steve, come over here.

476
00:35:54.756 --> 00:35:56.891
So what did you say to her?

477
00:35:56.893 --> 00:35:59.728
I love it.

478
00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:02.396
I just hear chirps. I
guess I don't have that one.

479
00:36:02.398 --> 00:36:06.871
Give it a shot. The secret
here is to slow things down.

480
00:36:14.611 --> 00:36:16.078
Nice to finally meet you, Adam.

481
00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.180
You look better in real
life than in your photo.

482
00:36:18.182 --> 00:36:19.983
- No way.
- Yes way.

483
00:36:19.985 --> 00:36:21.284
It works!

484
00:36:21.286 --> 00:36:24.188
It... Is... Nice... To... Meet... You!

485
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:26.288
You don't need to talk like that.

486
00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:27.757
They understand you just fine.

487
00:36:27.759 --> 00:36:30.159
What am I? Chopped liver?

488
00:36:30.161 --> 00:36:33.430
Sheesh. He doesn't even introduce me!

489
00:36:33.432 --> 00:36:35.265
The trees talk too?

490
00:36:35.267 --> 00:36:36.669
This place is like a Disney movie!

491
00:36:37.771 --> 00:36:40.271
Hello...!

492
00:36:40.273 --> 00:36:43.341
Trees don't talk, you stupid idiot.

493
00:36:43.343 --> 00:36:44.942
That's just Trapper.

494
00:36:46.679 --> 00:36:48.779
<i>Enchante.</i>!

495
00:36:48.781 --> 00:36:51.583
Yeah. This is my lovely wife, Weecha.

496
00:36:51.585 --> 00:36:53.185
She's also <i>enchanted.</i>

497
00:36:53.187 --> 00:36:54.786
Hello.

498
00:36:54.788 --> 00:36:56.423
Nice to finally meet you, Adam.

499
00:36:56.425 --> 00:36:58.858
Your dad talks about you all the time.

500
00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:00.459
Every real man has a son.

501
00:37:00.461 --> 00:37:02.361
I got kids on the way myself.

502
00:37:02.363 --> 00:37:03.796
All boys.

503
00:37:03.798 --> 00:37:05.497
We don't know that.

504
00:37:05.499 --> 00:37:07.332
I can tell.

505
00:37:07.334 --> 00:37:10.406
How you doin', fellas? Gettin'
big and strong in there? Good.

506
00:37:11.741 --> 00:37:13.172
I have to say...

507
00:37:13.174 --> 00:37:15.676
- The kid doesn't look like a bigfoot.
- Trapper!

508
00:37:15.678 --> 00:37:17.712
What? I'm just calling it like it is.

509
00:37:17.714 --> 00:37:20.916
You've all got eyes. This is a bigfoot.

510
00:37:20.918 --> 00:37:23.751
This is a boy. It's Humans 101.

511
00:37:23.753 --> 00:37:27.021
Don't listen to Trapper. Nobody here does.

512
00:37:27.023 --> 00:37:30.191
Are you kidding?
I'm like the boss around here!

513
00:37:30.193 --> 00:37:33.495
Everybody in this forest
hangs off my every word.

514
00:37:33.497 --> 00:37:36.299
Is he always like that?

515
00:37:36.301 --> 00:37:37.736
What a place.

516
00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:40.772
I'm starting to like it here.

517
00:37:45.911 --> 00:37:47.880
Don't run and don't turn your back to him.

518
00:37:49.581 --> 00:37:51.718
No. He's a big one!

519
00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.557
Careful, Dad! Don't...

520
00:38:04.064 --> 00:38:07.765
Nice performance, Wilbur. 10 out of 10!

521
00:38:07.767 --> 00:38:11.237
Well, thanks. I've been practicing.

522
00:38:11.239 --> 00:38:13.873
You jerk! I almost had a heart attack.

523
00:38:13.875 --> 00:38:15.373
Nothing to be afraid of.

524
00:38:15.375 --> 00:38:17.076
This is just Wilbur.

525
00:38:17.078 --> 00:38:20.312
He's a big teddy bear,
sweeter than a pot of honey.

526
00:38:20.314 --> 00:38:21.983
I am not!

527
00:38:22.816 --> 00:38:25.452
Okay, maybe I am.

528
00:38:25.454 --> 00:38:26.986
This is my son, Adam.

529
00:38:26.988 --> 00:38:29.321
Pleased to meet you, kid.

530
00:38:29.323 --> 00:38:31.425
Over the hill...

531
00:38:31.427 --> 00:38:33.895
Hello.

532
00:38:33.897 --> 00:38:36.230
- Two of 'em...
- Wow, slow down, Tina.

533
00:38:36.232 --> 00:38:38.098
Breathe through your nose.

534
00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:40.402
I ain't got time to
breathe through my nose!

535
00:38:40.404 --> 00:38:42.936
I'm talkin' about rednecks with guns!

536
00:38:42.938 --> 00:38:45.807
Hoo-hoo, hunters!

537
00:38:45.809 --> 00:38:47.575
Hunters? Should we hide?

538
00:38:47.577 --> 00:38:50.314
That won't be necessary.

539
00:38:52.215 --> 00:38:54.883
I, my friend, am a connoisseur

540
00:38:54.885 --> 00:38:56.786
and when it comes to hamburgers,

541
00:38:56.788 --> 00:39:00.556
this is a tasty piece of beef.

542
00:39:00.558 --> 00:39:02.891
I thought you got the fried chicken.

543
00:39:02.893 --> 00:39:07.330
My point is, whatever
it is, it's delicious.

544
00:39:09.101 --> 00:39:11.804
We haven't had hunters in three seasons!

545
00:39:13.639 --> 00:39:16.539
Blue 32. Green 180. Hut!

546
00:39:17.976 --> 00:39:19.776
Yee-haw!

547
00:39:19.778 --> 00:39:22.980
You think that'd be cruelty
to animals, but she loves it.

548
00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.553
My point is,

549
00:39:28.555 --> 00:39:30.522
we're smarter than them animals,

550
00:39:30.524 --> 00:39:33.528
so they deserve to die.

551
00:39:49.611 --> 00:39:51.678
That's the sign.

552
00:40:00.157 --> 00:40:03.224
It's a dog-eat-dog
world, my friend,

553
00:40:03.226 --> 00:40:04.958
but I ain't eatin' no dog.

554
00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.128
Which brings me back to my hamburger.

555
00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:08.997
That would be a chicken burger.

556
00:40:08.999 --> 00:40:10.368
Whatever burger.

557
00:40:29.254 --> 00:40:30.623
I got it!

558
00:40:31.355 --> 00:40:32.624
I saw it first!

559
00:40:38.965 --> 00:40:41.566
We got him, my friend!

560
00:40:41.568 --> 00:40:45.437
I told you dousing
ourselves in that bear urine

561
00:40:45.439 --> 00:40:47.105
would make us in-detectable.

562
00:40:47.107 --> 00:40:48.540
Like the Invisible Man.

563
00:40:48.542 --> 00:40:51.210
Ooh, you were right about that one, buddy.

564
00:40:51.212 --> 00:40:54.612
All we gotta do before we mount it
on the wall is make sure it's dead.

565
00:40:54.614 --> 00:40:55.983
Let's take a look.

566
00:40:58.219 --> 00:41:00.186
Yup. He's a goner.

567
00:41:00.188 --> 00:41:05.124
I love destroying
nature's most majestic creatures!

568
00:41:05.126 --> 00:41:08.394
Come on, get your butt
in here. Selfie time!

569
00:41:13.435 --> 00:41:16.136
<i>I'm gonna
post that up on Facebook,</i>

570
00:41:16.138 --> 00:41:17.904
<i>and watch the likes come rollin' in.</i>

571
00:41:17.906 --> 00:41:19.940
<i>Don't you be tagging me!</i>

572
00:41:19.942 --> 00:41:22.644
<i>My wife thinks I'm down at the
community college studyin' to be an...</i>

573
00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:29.452
Zombie bear!

574
00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.956
He's undead!

575
00:41:33.857 --> 00:41:35.392
I did poke it!

576
00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:45.235
And stay out!

577
00:41:45.237 --> 00:41:47.570
Nice shot, honey.

578
00:41:47.572 --> 00:41:51.474
They won't be
coming back for a while.

579
00:41:51.476 --> 00:41:54.679
That was the
best thing I've ever seen!

580
00:41:57.984 --> 00:41:59.850
At least you guys know
how to have a good time.

581
00:41:59.852 --> 00:42:02.586
We make the most of it.

582
00:42:02.588 --> 00:42:04.589
It's nice to finally have a dad.

583
00:42:04.591 --> 00:42:07.524
Well, then, son, we've got
to make up for lost time.

584
00:42:07.526 --> 00:42:09.527
All right. Where do we start?

585
00:42:09.529 --> 00:42:11.297
I don't know.

586
00:42:11.299 --> 00:42:16.869
Okay, so what's the best
father-son thing you can think of?

587
00:42:16.871 --> 00:42:19.837
Want to play baseball?

588
00:42:19.839 --> 00:42:22.544
Sure, why not? You got a ball?

589
00:42:25.414 --> 00:42:27.680
Whoa, I would have picked
a different activity

590
00:42:27.682 --> 00:42:30.149
if I'd known you had to
whittle a ball from scratch.

591
00:42:30.151 --> 00:42:31.718
That's how things work around here.

592
00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:33.420
You have to rely on yourself.

593
00:42:33.422 --> 00:42:35.855
Yeah. I guess you can't just
order it off the Internet.

594
00:42:35.857 --> 00:42:38.092
What's the Internet?

595
00:42:38.094 --> 00:42:40.761
You've never heard of the
Internet? Are you kidding me?

596
00:42:40.763 --> 00:42:42.362
Adam, I'm joking.

597
00:42:42.364 --> 00:42:44.998
I know what the Internet is. Come on!

598
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.737
I have tons of friends on MySpace.

599
00:42:48.972 --> 00:42:51.805
Things have changed a little bit.

600
00:42:51.807 --> 00:42:53.173
You'll see when you come back.

601
00:42:53.175 --> 00:42:55.545
Adam, I told you. I can't.

602
00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.915
I'm sorry, I know how you feel.

603
00:42:59.917 --> 00:43:01.553
Come on, son, show me what you got.

604
00:43:02.486 --> 00:43:03.886
Okay, Pops.

605
00:43:13.664 --> 00:43:16.599
Whoa, maybe we should try something else.

606
00:43:17.769 --> 00:43:19.505
Whoo-hoo!

607
00:43:20.206 --> 00:43:21.507
Whoo!

608
00:43:34.487 --> 00:43:36.290
Whoa, that felt great.

609
00:43:42.462 --> 00:43:44.731
Come on out, I'll race you back.

610
00:43:44.733 --> 00:43:47.667
All right, old man, bring it on.

611
00:43:56.278 --> 00:43:58.212
Give me a second.

612
00:43:58.214 --> 00:44:00.547
What's wrong, gettin' tired?

613
00:44:00.549 --> 00:44:02.116
You wish.

614
00:44:02.118 --> 00:44:03.784
Whoo-hoo!

615
00:44:03.786 --> 00:44:05.656
Hey, no fair!

616
00:44:18.936 --> 00:44:21.303
You totally cheated!

617
00:44:21.305 --> 00:44:23.475
We'll call it a tie.

618
00:44:24.308 --> 00:44:26.676
Whoa! Did you make this?

619
00:44:26.678 --> 00:44:29.145
Sure did. So do you play?

620
00:44:29.147 --> 00:44:30.882
Yeah. I love guitar!

621
00:44:36.956 --> 00:44:38.555
Yeah,

622
00:44:38.557 --> 00:44:40.691
try not squeezing so tight.

623
00:44:40.693 --> 00:44:44.497
Yeah, leave a little
space... Yeah, yeah. Okay.

624
00:44:47.201 --> 00:44:49.333
I think it's out of tune or something.

625
00:44:49.335 --> 00:44:52.170
Do you play or is it just to look cool?

626
00:44:52.172 --> 00:44:54.408
Well, you'll be the judge.

627
00:45:17.198 --> 00:45:18.732
Holy crap!

628
00:45:18.734 --> 00:45:21.067
Well, I've had lots of time to practice.

629
00:45:21.069 --> 00:45:23.070
Can you teach me how to do that?

630
00:45:23.072 --> 00:45:26.039
Well, maybe a little
bit more rock and roll.

631
00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:27.944
Of course, I'd be happy to.

632
00:45:33.583 --> 00:45:35.116
You have to come home with me.

633
00:45:35.118 --> 00:45:39.087
Adam, I wish I
could, but it's not safe.

634
00:45:39.089 --> 00:45:42.557
We can keep you a secret.
No one will ever know.

635
00:45:42.559 --> 00:45:44.392
They don't even know you're alive!

636
00:45:44.394 --> 00:45:46.093
HairCo will find out.

637
00:45:46.095 --> 00:45:48.697
I'm sure they've been
monitoring you and your mom.

638
00:45:48.699 --> 00:45:52.635
They're relentless. I've seen it firsthand.

639
00:45:52.637 --> 00:45:54.536
When I was in medical school,

640
00:45:54.538 --> 00:45:56.505
<i>I started studying my hair growth,</i>

641
00:45:56.507 --> 00:46:00.377
<i>desperately trying to make sense
of what was happening to me.</i>

642
00:46:00.379 --> 00:46:03.680
<i>I discovered a rare DNA
mutation in my blood</i>

643
00:46:03.682 --> 00:46:07.118
<i>was triggering a resurgence
of Neanderthal features.</i>

644
00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.556
<i>Every day I was becoming
more of a bigfoot.</i>

645
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:13.525
<i>HairCo found out
about my experiments.</i>

646
00:46:13.527 --> 00:46:16.527
<i>At first they tried to hire me</i>

647
00:46:16.529 --> 00:46:19.598
<i>but when I declined,
my lab was ransacked,</i>

648
00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:22.468
<i>and all my research stolen.</i>

649
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:24.803
<i>That's when things got
really out of control.</i>

650
00:46:24.805 --> 00:46:26.638
<i>They threatened your mother.</i>

651
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.508
<i>We couldn't go anywhere
without being followed.</i>

652
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:33.646
I knew the only way to keep
you safe was to disappear.

653
00:46:33.648 --> 00:46:37.183
Why didn't they come after me?
Don't we have the same...

654
00:46:37.185 --> 00:46:40.453
DNA. Yes, we do, but when you were younger,

655
00:46:40.455 --> 00:46:43.355
the genetic mutation hadn't activated yet.

656
00:46:43.357 --> 00:46:47.662
I'm sure they found some of your genetic
material when they ransacked the house.

657
00:46:47.664 --> 00:46:50.530
But back then, you'd have
seemed totally normal.

658
00:46:50.532 --> 00:46:52.133
That must be why they left us alone.

659
00:46:52.135 --> 00:46:54.802
And it's the reason I can't come back.

660
00:46:54.804 --> 00:46:57.639
It's too dangerous. If
they even suspect I'm alive,

661
00:46:57.641 --> 00:46:59.810
they'll stop at nothing
to get what they want.

662
00:47:04.281 --> 00:47:05.448
You.

663
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:06.748
What are you doing here?

664
00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:08.984
All day breakfast, of course.

665
00:47:08.986 --> 00:47:12.755
I jest. Please sit, Mrs. Harrison,

666
00:47:12.757 --> 00:47:16.527
so that we might solve the
problem of your missing boy.

667
00:47:16.529 --> 00:47:18.829
He hates that photo.

668
00:47:18.831 --> 00:47:21.164
You expect me to believe
you're here because of my son?

669
00:47:21.166 --> 00:47:22.634
You got me.

670
00:47:22.636 --> 00:47:24.602
I don't care about your son,

671
00:47:24.604 --> 00:47:27.908
but if we find him, we find your husband.

672
00:47:28.673 --> 00:47:30.341
My husband?

673
00:47:30.343 --> 00:47:32.410
He died a long time ago. You know that.

674
00:47:32.412 --> 00:47:34.312
Yes, well... No.

675
00:47:34.314 --> 00:47:38.052
Some new evidence has come to my
attention. Please read the headline.

676
00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:41.021
"Baby born in a pumpkin."

677
00:47:42.322 --> 00:47:44.424
The other headline.

678
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:48.761
Bigfoot? Really?

679
00:47:48.763 --> 00:47:53.832
Before he disappeared, your husband
was working on strange experiments.

680
00:47:53.834 --> 00:47:58.205
Studying hair growth.
Hair like we've never seen.

681
00:47:58.207 --> 00:48:01.077
Hair like that of say, a bigfoot.

682
00:48:02.679 --> 00:48:05.579
Quite a coincidence, wouldn't you say?

683
00:48:05.581 --> 00:48:11.352
Your son happens to show up at the
first Bigfoot sighting in 10 years?

684
00:48:11.354 --> 00:48:14.356
I don't think your husband
was studying Bigfoot.

685
00:48:14.358 --> 00:48:16.827
I think he is Bigfoot.

686
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:22.863
Ta-da! And you said I don't
wine and dine you anymore.

687
00:48:22.865 --> 00:48:24.833
Something isn't right.

688
00:48:24.835 --> 00:48:26.737
I thought you might say that.

689
00:48:27.538 --> 00:48:29.406
Perfect-issimo.

690
00:48:29.408 --> 00:48:32.808
A beautiful meal for my beautiful wife,

691
00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:35.144
and my
soon-to-be-born sons.

692
00:48:35.146 --> 00:48:38.282
Eat up boys, no runts in this litter!

693
00:48:38.284 --> 00:48:43.523
Shh, I'm serious. What are all
these black cars doing here?

694
00:48:45.724 --> 00:48:47.026
No.

695
00:48:48.227 --> 00:48:50.795
I know. He hates that photo.

696
00:48:55.736 --> 00:48:58.803
That's Bigfoot's wife.

697
00:48:58.805 --> 00:49:00.938
We're not leaving until we find him.

698
00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:04.078
Tear the forest down if you have to.

699
00:49:06.213 --> 00:49:08.715
Yuck. Looks way too healthy.

700
00:49:08.717 --> 00:49:10.950
Well, it is. And tastes good too.

701
00:49:10.952 --> 00:49:12.718
Ooh, don't you have any meat?

702
00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.321
I'm afraid not.

703
00:49:14.323 --> 00:49:16.957
You kind of have to be
a vegetarian out here.

704
00:49:16.959 --> 00:49:20.326
You eat one of those guys and
everyone starts asking questions.

705
00:49:20.328 --> 00:49:22.229
No, who ate Trapper?

706
00:49:22.231 --> 00:49:25.666
Where's Trapper? Have you seen Trapper?

707
00:49:25.668 --> 00:49:27.467
You can try to reason with them,

708
00:49:27.469 --> 00:49:29.969
but nobody cares that he's delicious.

709
00:49:29.971 --> 00:49:31.204
I am trying to tell them, you know,

710
00:49:31.206 --> 00:49:33.641
a little salt and pepper
on the old Trapper,

711
00:49:33.643 --> 00:49:36.278
it's so good. They don't want to hear it.

712
00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:38.716
I see how that could be awkward.

713
00:49:39.283 --> 00:49:40.682
Whoa, hot.

714
00:49:40.684 --> 00:49:42.551
Hot but good, right?

715
00:49:42.553 --> 00:49:44.285
No... Just hot.

716
00:49:44.287 --> 00:49:45.687
You have to admit,

717
00:49:45.689 --> 00:49:47.156
it's better than Mom's meatloaf.

718
00:49:47.158 --> 00:49:50.226
I'll give you that. What
is in that stuff anyway?

719
00:49:50.228 --> 00:49:53.996
Car tires, wet cardboard
boxes and lots of ketchup.

720
00:49:58.469 --> 00:50:00.303
We got a big problem.

721
00:50:00.305 --> 00:50:01.939
What's this?

722
00:50:01.941 --> 00:50:03.506
We saw Adam's mom. They
got her locked in a trailer.

723
00:50:03.508 --> 00:50:04.709
- Shelly?
- Mom?

724
00:50:04.711 --> 00:50:06.510
Hold on, it gets worse.

725
00:50:06.512 --> 00:50:09.081
There are a bazillion dudes
in suits heading this way.

726
00:50:20.794 --> 00:50:22.493
I'm sorry... I...

727
00:50:22.495 --> 00:50:24.329
You led them right to us.

728
00:50:24.331 --> 00:50:28.032
And what's worse, you
put your mother in danger!

729
00:50:28.034 --> 00:50:30.003
- I...
- Adam, what have you done?

730
00:50:30.005 --> 00:50:31.303
I didn't mean to.

731
00:50:31.305 --> 00:50:34.173
Actions have consequences.

732
00:50:34.175 --> 00:50:37.076
You should never have come here.

733
00:50:37.078 --> 00:50:39.346
Well, you better do something.

734
00:50:39.348 --> 00:50:42.681
If they find Bigfoot, the jig is up!

735
00:50:42.683 --> 00:50:43.783
I can fix this!

736
00:50:43.785 --> 00:50:45.051
What are you doing?

737
00:50:45.053 --> 00:50:46.687
I'll tell them I'm okay. It'll be fine.

738
00:50:46.689 --> 00:50:48.856
No, Adam, you don't know
who you're dealing with...

739
00:50:56.798 --> 00:50:57.934
Please be safe.

740
00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:01.569
Over here, you found me!

741
00:51:01.571 --> 00:51:04.105
Adam Harrison, the missing boy.

742
00:51:04.107 --> 00:51:06.711
Everything's fine. We can all go home.!

743
00:51:16.855 --> 00:51:18.554
Mom!

744
00:51:18.556 --> 00:51:20.356
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

745
00:51:20.358 --> 00:51:23.059
I'm sorry, Mom. I shouldn't have run away.

746
00:51:23.061 --> 00:51:24.595
And I should've told you the truth.

747
00:51:24.597 --> 00:51:27.464
There's a hundred agents in
the forest looking for Dad.

748
00:51:27.466 --> 00:51:29.767
Adam, shh, watch what you say.

749
00:51:29.769 --> 00:51:31.468
Don't worry, they'll never find him.

750
00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:34.571
He's hiding in the tunnels
near the base of the waterfall.

751
00:51:36.777 --> 00:51:39.010
This is an all-call.

752
00:51:39.012 --> 00:51:43.248
All agents re-route to sector G16.

753
00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:48.921
<i>I repeat, the prize is
in G16. I'm on my way.</i>

754
00:51:48.923 --> 00:51:53.658
You heard the man, turn
it around. Double time.

755
00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:57.064
The bigfoot is hiding down there.

756
00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:03.170
What are you waiting for? Get down there!

757
00:52:03.172 --> 00:52:04.770
I hear something.

758
00:52:04.772 --> 00:52:07.107
What is it?

759
00:52:17.153 --> 00:52:19.687
Someone push you in the pool?

760
00:52:19.689 --> 00:52:22.323
Adam! Don't hurt him! Please!

761
00:52:22.325 --> 00:52:24.793
Take her home. The boy rides with me.

762
00:52:24.795 --> 00:52:26.362
Where are you taking him?

763
00:52:26.364 --> 00:52:29.531
Don't worry, we'll be right behind you.

764
00:52:29.533 --> 00:52:32.370
We're going to have a little chat.

765
00:52:52.392 --> 00:52:55.493
One last chance. Where is your father?

766
00:52:55.495 --> 00:52:57.527
So you can lock him in a cage?

767
00:52:57.529 --> 00:53:00.766
Your father's DNA can
help millions of people.

768
00:53:00.768 --> 00:53:04.903
People who just want a
full head of healthy hair.

769
00:53:04.905 --> 00:53:07.673
So you just take some DNA and let him go?

770
00:53:07.675 --> 00:53:10.742
Not exactly. We'll be partners.

771
00:53:10.744 --> 00:53:14.013
Your dad will work exclusively for us.

772
00:53:14.015 --> 00:53:15.480
Give me a break.

773
00:53:15.482 --> 00:53:16.917
Adam, listen to me...

774
00:53:16.919 --> 00:53:19.086
He's not a lab rat. He's my dad!

775
00:53:22.524 --> 00:53:27.264
It's becoming clear to me that you
have no interest in negotiating.

776
00:53:28.063 --> 00:53:29.898
<i>Light it up, boys.</i>

777
00:53:34.603 --> 00:53:36.370
Are you crazy?

778
00:53:36.372 --> 00:53:41.176
Crazy is such an ugly
word. I prefer "motivated."

779
00:53:41.178 --> 00:53:43.477
You'll never catch him. There's
too much forest out there.

780
00:53:43.479 --> 00:53:47.851
My boy, the fire's
not for him. It's for you.

781
00:53:55.092 --> 00:53:56.992
Nice doing business with you.

782
00:53:56.994 --> 00:53:58.226
No!

783
00:54:22.589 --> 00:54:24.357
Help! Help me!

784
00:54:43.578 --> 00:54:44.547
Dad!

785
00:54:45.047 --> 00:54:46.349
Hang on!

786
00:54:53.889 --> 00:54:54.924
No!

787
00:54:56.726 --> 00:54:59.226
So predictable.

788
00:54:59.228 --> 00:55:01.899
Dad. Come on. Please.

789
00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:20.052
Dad!

790
00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:34.700
Mission accomplished. So long!

791
00:55:45.511 --> 00:55:46.946
Wake up, Adam.

792
00:55:50.718 --> 00:55:51.920
Wake up.

793
00:55:52.387 --> 00:55:53.785
Dad?

794
00:55:53.787 --> 00:55:56.455
He's awake. Are you okay?

795
00:55:56.457 --> 00:55:58.858
I... I think so.

796
00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:02.029
All right, then. Take
care of yourself, kid.

797
00:56:02.031 --> 00:56:04.031
Wait, where are you going?

798
00:56:04.033 --> 00:56:06.433
To find a new place to start over.

799
00:56:06.435 --> 00:56:07.634
You're just going to leave?

800
00:56:07.636 --> 00:56:09.569
Well, not much left here for us, is there?

801
00:56:09.571 --> 00:56:10.573
Way to go, man.

802
00:56:16.546 --> 00:56:18.282
Hey! Wait.

803
00:56:19.449 --> 00:56:20.881
Stop.

804
00:56:22.952 --> 00:56:24.852
Hey, I said stop!

805
00:56:30.361 --> 00:56:32.294
If you're going to bite my head off, do it.

806
00:56:32.296 --> 00:56:34.064
Otherwise, I've got something to say.

807
00:56:36.533 --> 00:56:39.269
I've got a plan but I need your help.

808
00:56:39.271 --> 00:56:41.606
It's your problem, not ours.

809
00:56:43.242 --> 00:56:46.075
This isn't about me, it's about my dad.

810
00:56:46.077 --> 00:56:48.979
I made the mistake, he
shouldn't have to pay for it.

811
00:56:48.981 --> 00:56:52.417
So you want us to bail you out now? Nice.

812
00:56:52.419 --> 00:56:54.285
I didn't mean for this to happen.

813
00:56:54.287 --> 00:56:57.587
I just came out here to
find my family. I'm sorry.

814
00:56:57.589 --> 00:57:00.424
Sorry isn't going to
unburn down our forest!

815
00:57:00.426 --> 00:57:04.429
If I could take it back,
I would. But I can't.

816
00:57:04.431 --> 00:57:06.764
Please, guys, I need your help.

817
00:57:06.766 --> 00:57:09.199
When animals go up against humans,

818
00:57:09.201 --> 00:57:11.101
humans always win.

819
00:57:11.103 --> 00:57:14.173
I'm not gonna end up a bearskin rug.

820
00:57:14.175 --> 00:57:16.843
What would Bigfoot do
if you were in trouble?

821
00:57:16.845 --> 00:57:18.477
Would he just walk away?

822
00:57:18.479 --> 00:57:21.013
Sometimes doing the right thing is hard.

823
00:57:21.015 --> 00:57:24.082
I'm not going to tell
you it won't be dangerous.

824
00:57:24.084 --> 00:57:26.954
But the only way we stand a
chance is if we work together.

825
00:57:26.956 --> 00:57:29.826
Please, Bigfoot needs your help.

826
00:57:31.494 --> 00:57:34.860
The kid's right. Bigfoot needs us.

827
00:57:34.862 --> 00:57:37.499
I agree with them, I'm in.

828
00:57:37.501 --> 00:57:40.033
All right then, we're in.

829
00:57:40.035 --> 00:57:42.870
Whoa, wait, we're not
even going to discuss it?

830
00:57:42.872 --> 00:57:47.175
I was going to say "in"
too, you just said it first.

831
00:57:47.177 --> 00:57:49.178
What do you say, Wilbur?

832
00:57:51.681 --> 00:57:53.516
Okay.

833
00:57:53.518 --> 00:57:55.453
Let's do it for Bigfoot.

834
00:58:12.604 --> 00:58:15.172
I
could watch that all day.

835
00:58:15.174 --> 00:58:16.973
It's incredible.

836
00:58:16.975 --> 00:58:20.877
The structure of the hair is
different at the molecular level.

837
00:58:23.216 --> 00:58:25.584
It's awake.

838
00:58:25.586 --> 00:58:28.320
Good morning, my dear beast.

839
00:58:28.322 --> 00:58:32.157
Or should I say... Doctor Harrison?

840
00:58:32.159 --> 00:58:34.092
Let me go!

841
00:58:34.094 --> 00:58:35.697
Calm down.

842
00:58:39.033 --> 00:58:40.567
Or not.

843
00:58:40.569 --> 00:58:41.804
Get back!

844
00:58:43.738 --> 00:58:45.904
No, no, no. There's no need for that.

845
00:58:45.906 --> 00:58:49.609
Do you have any idea what that thing costs?

846
00:58:49.611 --> 00:58:52.278
I'm sure we've got another one.

847
00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:55.615
The benefits of being rich.

848
00:58:55.617 --> 00:58:59.154
This thing here, I have no idea what it is.

849
00:59:02.225 --> 00:59:04.792
But we'll replace it too.

850
00:59:04.794 --> 00:59:08.263
The only thing of value
here is our new friend.

851
00:59:08.265 --> 00:59:10.464
You'll never get what you want from me.

852
00:59:10.466 --> 00:59:13.301
I'll fight you every step of the way.

853
00:59:13.303 --> 00:59:15.472
No, you won't.

854
00:59:15.474 --> 00:59:17.273
You want to know how I know?

855
00:59:17.275 --> 00:59:19.277
Your family is still out there.

856
00:59:20.344 --> 00:59:22.112
Leave them out of this.

857
00:59:22.114 --> 00:59:24.079
Happily. I have no use for them.

858
00:59:24.081 --> 00:59:26.450
But if you make life hard for us,

859
00:59:26.452 --> 00:59:29.319
we can make life very hard for them.

860
00:59:29.321 --> 00:59:32.723
That said, if you cooperate...

861
00:59:32.725 --> 00:59:35.926
I promise to take good care of your family.

862
00:59:35.928 --> 00:59:38.932
So, Mr. Bigfoot, what will it be?

863
00:59:45.471 --> 00:59:47.938
Well, guys, it looks like we're
going to have to hitch a ride.

864
00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:49.007
Got it.

865
00:59:51.579 --> 00:59:53.979
- What?
- More of a covert ride.

866
00:59:53.981 --> 00:59:56.783
Got it.

867
00:59:56.785 --> 01:00:00.352
Okay, we'll wait for the last
trailer in the convoy. Everyone ready?

868
01:00:00.354 --> 01:00:01.653
I was born ready.

869
01:00:01.655 --> 01:00:03.455
Actually, I was born a few weeks early.

870
01:00:03.457 --> 01:00:04.891
I needed a lot of help to get started...

871
01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:06.527
- Shut up.
- Will you shut up?

872
01:00:06.529 --> 01:00:07.826
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

873
01:00:07.828 --> 01:00:08.995
What?

874
01:00:08.997 --> 01:00:11.330
Okay, guys, it's now or never.

875
01:00:11.332 --> 01:00:13.232
Are you sure about this?

876
01:00:13.234 --> 01:00:14.336
Now.

877
01:00:17.874 --> 01:00:20.077
This is nuts. Whoa!

878
01:00:22.211 --> 01:00:23.213
Whoa!

879
01:00:30.654 --> 01:00:32.522
Wait! Hold on!

880
01:00:33.055 --> 01:00:34.355
Wilbur! Run!

881
01:00:34.357 --> 01:00:36.060
What do you think I'm doing?

882
01:00:45.202 --> 01:00:47.202
Whoa, what was that?

883
01:00:47.204 --> 01:00:48.470
Why you don't y'all go check it out?

884
01:00:48.472 --> 01:00:51.207
Aw, why do I have to
go? I'm covered in latte!

885
01:00:51.209 --> 01:00:54.044
You're drinking a latte?

886
01:00:54.046 --> 01:00:55.548
What's wrong with that?

887
01:00:56.749 --> 01:00:59.051
Fine. Let's both go.

888
01:01:03.523 --> 01:01:05.760
All right, let's roll.

889
01:01:12.465 --> 01:01:15.801
Hang on tight, guys. This
is going to be a long ride.

890
01:01:15.803 --> 01:01:18.572
Check out Steve. He's loving it.

891
01:01:22.943 --> 01:01:26.111
This is amazing.

892
01:01:27.382 --> 01:01:28.750
He probably got tired
of pecking for a living.

893
01:01:31.085 --> 01:01:33.119
I've extracted the bigfoot DNA

894
01:01:33.121 --> 01:01:35.088
and spliced it into the sequence.

895
01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:36.922
So what are you waiting for?

896
01:01:36.924 --> 01:01:39.794
This needs to be tested immediately.

897
01:01:39.796 --> 01:01:41.431
Send in the intern.

898
01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:46.734
Dr. Billingsley? Hi.

899
01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:48.903
I... I don't mean to bother you,

900
01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:52.440
but I really need you
to sign my time sheet...

901
01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:54.409
No, not again!

902
01:01:54.411 --> 01:02:00.148
Ouch! I need to really
call my academic adviser.

903
01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:07.356
What's going on?

904
01:02:07.358 --> 01:02:10.662
My hair, it's growing.

905
01:02:19.171 --> 01:02:20.937
Incredible!

906
01:02:20.939 --> 01:02:24.141
It will be, but I'm still
fine-tuning the genetic sequence.

907
01:02:24.143 --> 01:02:27.144
We're close, but I need
more time with Bigfoot.

908
01:02:27.146 --> 01:02:29.313
We're closer than we've ever been.

909
01:02:29.315 --> 01:02:31.282
I want you working around the clock.

910
01:02:31.284 --> 01:02:35.355
Nobody rests and nobody goes home
until we've cracked this thing.

911
01:02:36.123 --> 01:02:38.191
Sir?

912
01:02:47.336 --> 01:02:49.768
Greg. Gerry. What's new with you guys?

913
01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:51.704
This guy drinks lattes.

914
01:02:51.706 --> 01:02:54.708
Come on. You promised to let it go.

915
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:56.879
Well, lah-di-dah.

916
01:03:08.926 --> 01:03:11.526
Are you kidding me?

917
01:03:15.199 --> 01:03:18.701
How are we going to find
him? This place is gigantic!

918
01:03:18.703 --> 01:03:20.938
Shh. Let me concentrate.

919
01:03:35.186 --> 01:03:38.354
How much time do you
need to finish sequencing his DNA?

920
01:03:38.356 --> 01:03:40.092
The ongoing mutations are...

921
01:03:42.161 --> 01:03:44.996
I can't see him. We've got to get closer.

922
01:03:44.998 --> 01:03:46.998
Steve, take out those security cameras.

923
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.065
I'm on it.

924
01:03:48.067 --> 01:03:50.270
Everyone else, come with me.

925
01:04:04.618 --> 01:04:06.321
Piece of junk!

926
01:04:31.482 --> 01:04:33.181
<i>Sir?</i>

927
01:04:33.183 --> 01:04:35.484
Yeah, tech support? There's
something wrong with the system here.

928
01:04:35.486 --> 01:04:37.384
All the monitors are on the fritz.

929
01:04:37.386 --> 01:04:39.989
<i>Have you checked if
they are all plugged in?</i>

930
01:04:39.991 --> 01:04:41.425
Of course they're plugged in!

931
01:04:42.893 --> 01:04:44.626
What do you say we smash it down?

932
01:04:44.628 --> 01:04:46.662
Stealth all the way.

933
01:04:46.664 --> 01:04:50.932
Step aside, kid. Let a
professional show you how it's done.

934
01:04:50.934 --> 01:04:52.435
Where'd you get that mask?

935
01:04:52.437 --> 01:04:55.504
Girl, there's a lot
you don't know about me.

936
01:04:55.506 --> 01:04:59.444
Lick, stick, and cut.

937
01:05:03.916 --> 01:05:05.119
Shoot.

938
01:05:09.688 --> 01:05:13.356
We've got a perimeter breach!

939
01:05:13.358 --> 01:05:17.229
The wrong thing to do here would
be to start pointing fingers.

940
01:05:17.231 --> 01:05:19.832
Careful... Careful... There's
broken glass everywhere.

941
01:05:19.834 --> 01:05:22.033
<i>This is
standard troubleshooting procedure.</i>

942
01:05:22.035 --> 01:05:24.836
<i>Ninety percent of the time,
something is unplugged.</i>

943
01:05:24.838 --> 01:05:28.741
Like I said, everything is plugged in!

944
01:05:33.681 --> 01:05:36.982
Help! Tech support!
Get down here right now!

945
01:05:36.984 --> 01:05:40.423
<i>I'm so sorry, sir, I am in
India. There is nothing I can do.</i>

946
01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:47.160
<i>Have I been helpful for you today?</i>

947
01:05:47.162 --> 01:05:49.065
<i>Would you be willing
to take a short survey?</i>

948
01:05:50.832 --> 01:05:51.868
There he is.

949
01:05:53.837 --> 01:05:55.636
We'll have to go through that door.

950
01:05:55.638 --> 01:05:57.107
Watch out, Wilbur, they're coming in!

951
01:05:59.676 --> 01:06:01.476
Don't worry. I got it.

952
01:06:01.478 --> 01:06:04.680
What are we gonna do?
How do we get out of here?

953
01:06:04.682 --> 01:06:06.816
Check the lockers for anything we can use.

954
01:06:06.818 --> 01:06:08.383
Take whatever you can carry.

955
01:06:08.385 --> 01:06:10.889
I need more men. Get them down here now!

956
01:06:12.858 --> 01:06:16.093
Jackpot! Does it make me look cool?

957
01:06:16.095 --> 01:06:19.397
Hey, no fair! I want the
flare gun! Me, me, me me, me!

958
01:06:19.399 --> 01:06:20.732
Fine, take it.

959
01:06:26.872 --> 01:06:28.576
What?

960
01:06:33.813 --> 01:06:34.979
What?

961
01:06:34.981 --> 01:06:37.317
Maybe we should try something else.

962
01:06:38.784 --> 01:06:40.752
Yeah, that's more like it!

963
01:06:42.122 --> 01:06:44.992
Watch where you're swinging that thing!

964
01:06:47.694 --> 01:06:48.893
On three.

965
01:06:48.895 --> 01:06:50.796
Okay, guys. It's now or never.

966
01:06:50.798 --> 01:06:52.065
Okay.

967
01:06:52.067 --> 01:06:53.235
One...

968
01:06:53.969 --> 01:06:55.402
Two...

969
01:06:56.904 --> 01:06:57.906
Three!

970
01:07:02.043 --> 01:07:03.011
Fire. Fire!

971
01:07:05.749 --> 01:07:07.684
Keep firing! Keep...!

972
01:07:14.423 --> 01:07:15.991
Gotcha, you little weasel.

973
01:07:15.993 --> 01:07:18.529
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?

974
01:07:22.632 --> 01:07:25.034
Bring it on, suckers!

975
01:07:28.773 --> 01:07:29.741
Ha!

976
01:07:35.713 --> 01:07:36.715
No!

977
01:07:37.548 --> 01:07:39.817
Get your hands off him.

978
01:07:47.092 --> 01:07:48.792
What now?

979
01:07:48.794 --> 01:07:52.465
I'll deal with them. You go
find your dad. Go, Adam, go.

980
01:08:03.342 --> 01:08:04.378
Over there.

981
01:08:26.869 --> 01:08:27.870
Come on, Captain!

982
01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:35.745
Over there!

983
01:08:44.255 --> 01:08:46.089
Whoa, get off me.

984
01:08:51.362 --> 01:08:54.096
Hey, Wilbur, get me up there!

985
01:08:54.098 --> 01:08:56.767
My pleasure. Whoa!

986
01:08:59.704 --> 01:09:02.140
Yee haw!

987
01:09:11.183 --> 01:09:12.582
Whoo-hoo!

988
01:09:13.785 --> 01:09:14.885
- Don't move!
- What?

989
01:09:14.887 --> 01:09:16.019
You're under arrest.

990
01:09:16.021 --> 01:09:17.824
Y'all got to read me my rights.

991
01:09:21.329 --> 01:09:23.328
That is one tough bear.

992
01:09:36.178 --> 01:09:37.444
Dad!

993
01:09:37.446 --> 01:09:39.078
Adam, how did you get in here?

994
01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:42.349
Long story, but don't worry,
I am here to get you out.

995
01:09:42.351 --> 01:09:44.018
It's going to be okay, Adam.

996
01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:45.286
What are you doing?

997
01:09:45.288 --> 01:09:47.621
Everything I did was to keep you safe.

998
01:09:47.623 --> 01:09:50.790
Not a day went by that I
didn't wish I was in your life.

999
01:09:50.792 --> 01:09:52.594
We've got to hurry. Come on!

1000
01:09:52.596 --> 01:09:54.796
I need you to believe that.

1001
01:09:54.798 --> 01:09:57.098
You've been a naughty, naughty boy, Adam.

1002
01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:59.801
It's very lucky your
father is a friend of mine,

1003
01:09:59.803 --> 01:10:02.770
and friends forgive and forget.

1004
01:10:02.772 --> 01:10:04.774
You're going to have to catch us first.

1005
01:10:04.776 --> 01:10:06.176
Come on, Dad. Let's run!

1006
01:10:06.178 --> 01:10:07.676
I'm not going with you.

1007
01:10:07.678 --> 01:10:09.444
What?

1008
01:10:09.446 --> 01:10:13.449
I'm staying here. You and your
mother are going to be safe.

1009
01:10:13.451 --> 01:10:15.185
It's better this way.

1010
01:10:15.187 --> 01:10:16.652
What did you do to him?

1011
01:10:16.654 --> 01:10:18.622
He's sick. You're killing him!

1012
01:10:18.624 --> 01:10:22.958
He's here under his own free
will. He can leave at any time.

1013
01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.863
I'll be fine. Just go, Adam.

1014
01:10:25.798 --> 01:10:27.530
Don't look so surprised,

1015
01:10:27.532 --> 01:10:30.067
we're partners, your dad and I.

1016
01:10:30.069 --> 01:10:32.202
- I told you we would be.
- Go on, now.

1017
01:10:32.204 --> 01:10:35.240
No! I'm not leaving without you.

1018
01:10:35.242 --> 01:10:37.342
You promised not to hurt him!

1019
01:10:37.344 --> 01:10:39.380
Treat our young guest gently.

1020
01:10:41.583 --> 01:10:44.683
It's time for Daddy to get back to work.

1021
01:10:44.685 --> 01:10:46.087
Take care of your mother.

1022
01:11:03.504 --> 01:11:07.175
I had the most beautiful dream.

1023
01:11:07.177 --> 01:11:09.510
I could take the rings off my tail

1024
01:11:09.512 --> 01:11:13.146
and link them together
like a fancy magician.

1025
01:11:13.148 --> 01:11:14.882
I could be your assistant.

1026
01:11:14.884 --> 01:11:18.553
You could saw me in
half, quarters, pennies,

1027
01:11:18.555 --> 01:11:19.821
whatever spare change you like...

1028
01:11:19.823 --> 01:11:22.057
Whoa, how many darts did you guys have?

1029
01:11:22.059 --> 01:11:25.593
Let's just say that I was over my limit.

1030
01:11:25.595 --> 01:11:28.763
You'll never have
to worry about anything again.

1031
01:11:28.765 --> 01:11:32.438
Take it from me, you're
going to love being rich.

1032
01:11:35.207 --> 01:11:40.308
Man, the kid sold us out.
He took the money and ran.

1033
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:44.215
Just think of it like he's
away on a business trip,

1034
01:11:44.217 --> 01:11:46.716
working hard to provide for you.

1035
01:11:46.718 --> 01:11:49.485
Except he never comes home
from this business trip.

1036
01:11:49.487 --> 01:11:53.358
Your father is a busy
man. You know how it is.

1037
01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.926
Well, business is business, I guess.

1038
01:11:55.928 --> 01:11:57.063
That a boy.

1039
01:11:58.732 --> 01:12:01.199
Stop him! Get the boy.

1040
01:12:01.201 --> 01:12:03.404
Business is business!

1041
01:12:10.711 --> 01:12:14.312
- Don't let it get wet!
- My beautiful hair!

1042
01:12:14.314 --> 01:12:16.214
My toupee!

1043
01:12:19.822 --> 01:12:26.826
Security! Security! Shut down the fire
alarm in sector 4 and open the doors!

1044
01:12:26.828 --> 01:12:31.299
<i>Security, shut down the
fire alarm in sector 4.</i>

1045
01:12:31.301 --> 01:12:32.466
What?

1046
01:12:32.468 --> 01:12:34.404
A... A fire? No.

1047
01:12:40.209 --> 01:12:42.110
<i>Evacuate! Evacuate!</i>

1048
01:12:42.112 --> 01:12:45.479
<i>Please proceed to your nearest
exit in an orderly manner.</i>

1049
01:12:45.481 --> 01:12:47.783
What's wrong with that guy?

1050
01:12:47.785 --> 01:12:52.054
Security, security. Switch
off the alarm right away!

1051
01:12:52.056 --> 01:12:54.156
<i>Evacuate. Evacuate.</i>

1052
01:12:55.594 --> 01:12:59.329
Stop it, stop it, this is a false alarm.

1053
01:12:59.331 --> 01:13:01.131
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

1054
01:13:01.133 --> 01:13:03.799
<i>Please exit the facility at once.</i>

1055
01:13:03.801 --> 01:13:05.202
What are you doing?

1056
01:13:05.204 --> 01:13:06.303
Standard procedure, sir.

1057
01:13:06.305 --> 01:13:08.675
Let me... Argh! ...go!

1058
01:13:14.447 --> 01:13:18.149
Look who's back.
Mister sellout moneybags.

1059
01:13:18.151 --> 01:13:20.117
Did you really think I'd leave you here?

1060
01:13:22.588 --> 01:13:23.822
Get these cages open now. Everybody out.

1061
01:13:23.824 --> 01:13:25.990
Yeah.

1062
01:13:25.992 --> 01:13:28.029
Feel free to start with me.

1063
01:13:33.267 --> 01:13:35.902
I can't believe you're unlocking
all these randoms before me!

1064
01:13:35.904 --> 01:13:37.537
Thank you, my dear.

1065
01:13:37.539 --> 01:13:40.273
Hello there, cowboy.

1066
01:13:40.275 --> 01:13:41.276
What are you in for?

1067
01:13:41.811 --> 01:13:42.911
Murder.

1068
01:13:44.245 --> 01:13:46.113
Just joking. I eat carrots.

1069
01:13:46.115 --> 01:13:48.217
You're funny.

1070
01:13:51.419 --> 01:13:53.553
Tina! Get me out of here!

1071
01:13:53.555 --> 01:13:56.426
This is not the time for
fraternizing with inmates!

1072
01:13:58.828 --> 01:14:00.160
Adam, what are you doing?

1073
01:14:00.162 --> 01:14:02.196
Come on, Dad, I'm breaking you out.

1074
01:14:02.198 --> 01:14:07.169
I told you, I can't go. They'll always
be after me. We'll always be hiding.

1075
01:14:07.171 --> 01:14:09.371
I don't care, as long as we're together.

1076
01:14:09.373 --> 01:14:13.875
No, I won't do that to
you. I'm not leaving.

1077
01:14:13.877 --> 01:14:17.379
If you don't come with me, I'll
tell them I'm a bigfoot too.

1078
01:14:17.381 --> 01:14:19.383
You can't.

1079
01:14:19.385 --> 01:14:22.352
I've got your genes, I've got your crazy
hair. I've got everything they need.

1080
01:14:22.354 --> 01:14:23.419
Adam, no.

1081
01:14:23.421 --> 01:14:25.955
Either we both stay, or we both go.

1082
01:14:25.957 --> 01:14:27.691
It's up to you.

1083
01:14:27.693 --> 01:14:30.964
But I need my dad, and I'm
not leaving here without you.

1084
01:14:34.299 --> 01:14:36.936
You are one stubborn kid.

1085
01:14:38.905 --> 01:14:41.708
I guess I take after my old man.

1086
01:14:45.679 --> 01:14:48.847
Where's Adam? You said
he was right behind us.

1087
01:14:48.849 --> 01:14:51.182
What have you done with my son?

1088
01:14:51.184 --> 01:14:53.284
Calm down, he's on the way.

1089
01:14:53.286 --> 01:14:54.855
As soon as he gets home,
we'll be out of your hair.

1090
01:14:54.857 --> 01:14:57.656
As soon as you leave, I'm calling the cops.

1091
01:14:57.658 --> 01:14:59.959
What are you gonna say?

1092
01:14:59.961 --> 01:15:02.395
"Hello, police? My husband is Bigfoot,

1093
01:15:02.397 --> 01:15:04.464
"and he's been captured
in an evil conspiracy."

1094
01:15:04.466 --> 01:15:06.733
Sounds pretty crazy to me.

1095
01:15:06.735 --> 01:15:09.002
You know, someone with a story like that

1096
01:15:09.004 --> 01:15:11.138
probably isn't fit to raise a kid.

1097
01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:13.907
How dare you. You should
be ashamed of yourself.

1098
01:15:13.909 --> 01:15:16.576
Listen, lady, we're just doing our jobs.

1099
01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:20.916
Now where's the can? You
got a bathroom in this place?

1100
01:15:20.918 --> 01:15:23.320
No, we go in the bushes outside.

1101
01:15:24.487 --> 01:15:25.990
It's upstairs.

1102
01:15:32.996 --> 01:15:35.832
Simpson! Come into
the bathroom, right now!

1103
01:15:35.834 --> 01:15:39.534
That's okay, I'll
wait until you're done.

1104
01:15:39.536 --> 01:15:41.238
Would you get in here?

1105
01:15:43.474 --> 01:15:45.210
What's going on?

1106
01:15:48.813 --> 01:15:50.480
Sir, we're at the house.

1107
01:15:50.482 --> 01:15:53.048
The boy's a bigfoot. We've
got the hair to prove it.

1108
01:15:53.050 --> 01:15:56.220
<i>What?
Fantastic! Change of plan, then.</i>

1109
01:15:56.222 --> 01:15:57.890
Roger that.

1110
01:16:07.935 --> 01:16:12.037
That's not very nice. Do you
treat all your guests like this?

1111
01:16:12.039 --> 01:16:14.473
Just the ones that kidnap my son.

1112
01:16:19.647 --> 01:16:22.314
<i>Evacuate, evacuate.</i>

1113
01:16:22.316 --> 01:16:24.851
<i>Time to get your butts in gear.</i>

1114
01:16:24.853 --> 01:16:27.386
<i>Evacuate! Evacuate!</i>

1115
01:16:31.893 --> 01:16:33.229
Follow me, buddy.

1116
01:16:36.732 --> 01:16:40.604
No more hiding. We're shutting
this place down for good.

1117
01:16:59.724 --> 01:17:02.293
No! Come on. Hurry!

1118
01:17:08.133 --> 01:17:10.266
What now?

1119
01:17:10.268 --> 01:17:12.369
There's got to be another way out.

1120
01:17:12.371 --> 01:17:13.338
Dad, up there.

1121
01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:17.075
Let's check it out... Follow me.

1122
01:17:22.415 --> 01:17:26.618
Adam, watch where you step. Stay close.

1123
01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:28.988
Keep on going, I'm right behind you.

1124
01:17:37.965 --> 01:17:39.000
Up there.

1125
01:17:48.444 --> 01:17:50.844
There's no way down. We're trapped.

1126
01:17:50.846 --> 01:17:52.014
No, Dad. Look.

1127
01:17:54.516 --> 01:17:55.518
- Zipline!
- Zipline!

1128
01:18:02.458 --> 01:18:03.724
Aah!

1129
01:18:03.726 --> 01:18:04.727
Shoot.

1130
01:18:09.366 --> 01:18:12.337
One way in, one way out.

1131
01:18:14.404 --> 01:18:15.406
We're going home.

1132
01:18:18.407 --> 01:18:21.246
Let me go, you big oaf.

1133
01:18:22.548 --> 01:18:24.748
So what'll it be?

1134
01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:28.584
Shall we end this little charade
and return you to your cell?

1135
01:18:28.586 --> 01:18:30.486
He's never going back there.

1136
01:18:31.658 --> 01:18:32.626
Dad!

1137
01:18:35.394 --> 01:18:39.464
You silly beast. You lied to me.

1138
01:18:39.466 --> 01:18:43.902
You're not so special. The
boy has everything we need.

1139
01:18:43.904 --> 01:18:46.804
No, please. Leave him alone. You promised.

1140
01:18:46.806 --> 01:18:48.009
It's too late now.

1141
01:18:59.253 --> 01:19:03.021
I would've kept you
both, but I only need one.

1142
01:19:03.023 --> 01:19:04.293
No, please!

1143
01:19:05.359 --> 01:19:06.361
I'm sorry, son.

1144
01:19:09.197 --> 01:19:10.198
No!

1145
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:16.403
No.

1146
01:19:16.405 --> 01:19:18.105
Argh! You animal!

1147
01:19:18.107 --> 01:19:21.045
Really, it's
you who is the animal.

1148
01:19:24.014 --> 01:19:26.414
I hate to break it to you,

1149
01:19:26.416 --> 01:19:28.583
but that's only a flare gun.

1150
01:19:28.585 --> 01:19:31.687
It won't do you any
good. Now get back inside,

1151
01:19:31.689 --> 01:19:33.088
we've got work to do.

1152
01:19:33.090 --> 01:19:35.726
No, you're out of business.

1153
01:19:53.277 --> 01:19:54.512
No!

1154
01:20:21.109 --> 01:20:24.213
Don't just stand there, pull me up!

1155
01:20:29.283 --> 01:20:30.849
No!

1156
01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:34.323
Ooh, that must hurt.

1157
01:20:39.662 --> 01:20:40.829
Dad!

1158
01:20:41.631 --> 01:20:42.731
Dad!

1159
01:20:49.505 --> 01:20:52.476
Please, don't leave me.

1160
01:20:59.716 --> 01:21:03.054
<i>The healing touch, it
all goes with the territory.</i>

1161
01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:32.317
Look at that! He really is a bigfoot.

1162
01:21:32.319 --> 01:21:35.187
You see, you never listen
to me. I told you so!

1163
01:21:35.189 --> 01:21:36.988
Are you kidding?

1164
01:21:59.048 --> 01:22:00.015
Adam?

1165
01:22:01.050 --> 01:22:02.018
Dad?

1166
01:22:08.126 --> 01:22:10.625
For the better or for the worse,

1167
01:22:10.627 --> 01:22:12.628
it looks like you're stuck with me now.

1168
01:22:12.630 --> 01:22:15.598
You know, Dad, I'm glad to be a bigfoot.

1169
01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.398
Me too.

1170
01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:20.402
I don't know how you did
it, but that was amazing!

1171
01:22:20.404 --> 01:22:24.107
I got to say it, kid, you're the real deal!

1172
01:22:24.109 --> 01:22:26.809
I guess I am. Whoa, watch out guys!

1173
01:22:26.811 --> 01:22:32.150
You... You should have kept
your end of the bargain.

1174
01:22:33.085 --> 01:22:36.021
It did not have to end this way.

1175
01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:44.231
Nobody messes with my family.

1176
01:22:45.331 --> 01:22:47.265
My kinda woman.

1177
01:22:47.267 --> 01:22:49.301
- Mom.
- Honey.

1178
01:22:51.639 --> 01:22:54.905
Hi, sweetheart. It's great to see you.

1179
01:22:54.907 --> 01:22:57.241
- No more hiding.
- No more hiding.

1180
01:22:57.243 --> 01:22:58.712
Look what I found.

1181
01:23:03.416 --> 01:23:08.990
Yo, dudes, metal! Tada da da da da da, yeah!

1182
01:23:16.597 --> 01:23:18.432
My research.

1183
01:23:18.434 --> 01:23:19.901
My lab!

1184
01:23:22.606 --> 01:23:25.876
My time sheet.

1185
01:23:38.856 --> 01:23:41.824
Hey! That hurts.

1186
01:23:41.826 --> 01:23:43.895
Don't you have a snooze button?

1187
01:23:45.496 --> 01:23:48.200
You're gonna be late
for school. Now get up!

1188
01:23:54.406 --> 01:23:57.008
Yeah!

1189
01:23:57.010 --> 01:23:59.746
Good mornin'! Allow me.

1190
01:24:01.747 --> 01:24:03.283
Oops. Sorry.

1191
01:24:05.184 --> 01:24:06.616
Good to go.

1192
01:24:06.618 --> 01:24:08.153
Ew, gross.

1193
01:24:18.031 --> 01:24:20.232
How about a bearskin rug!

1194
01:24:22.969 --> 01:24:25.007
He's so soft.

1195
01:24:33.415 --> 01:24:34.882
Hello, everyone.

1196
01:24:34.884 --> 01:24:38.385
Whoa, Trapper, that's
going to give me nightmares!

1197
01:24:38.387 --> 01:24:40.654
Girls, don't listen to Uncle Adam,

1198
01:24:40.656 --> 01:24:45.093
he's just jealous of how pretty you
made me look. Now who's doing my nails?

1199
01:24:45.095 --> 01:24:47.895
And you thought
you were going to have boys.

1200
01:24:47.897 --> 01:24:49.597
I never said that.

1201
01:24:49.599 --> 01:24:51.935
That raccoon will never change.

1202
01:24:53.635 --> 01:24:56.036
I could get used to this.

1203
01:24:56.038 --> 01:24:58.741
I could definitely get used to this.

1204
01:24:58.743 --> 01:25:03.815
Well, get used to it. We've got a
lot of breakfasts to make up for.

1205
01:25:04.315 --> 01:25:06.247
Ooh, gotta go.

1206
01:25:06.249 --> 01:25:07.782
See you guys tonight.

1207
01:25:07.784 --> 01:25:08.987
Don't forget your lunch.

1208
01:25:10.455 --> 01:25:12.421
Let me guess, meatloaf?

1209
01:25:12.423 --> 01:25:13.957
But of course.

1210
01:25:13.959 --> 01:25:17.094
New house rule. From now
on, Dad does all the cooking.

1211
01:25:17.096 --> 01:25:18.929
You got a deal.

1212
01:25:18.931 --> 01:25:22.336
I, I'm not so sure...

1213
01:25:27.973 --> 01:25:32.008
Well, well, well. What do we have here?

1214
01:25:32.010 --> 01:25:34.946
Hey, Tony, what are you
doing here all by yourself?

1215
01:25:34.948 --> 01:25:36.147
Where are your bros?

1216
01:25:39.118 --> 01:25:42.620
Calling in the cavalry. I
guess some things never change.

1217
01:25:42.622 --> 01:25:44.455
Where have you been, mop-top?

1218
01:25:45.527 --> 01:25:47.126
You know what? I like my hair.

1219
01:25:47.128 --> 01:25:49.094
Good for you.

1220
01:25:49.096 --> 01:25:50.929
I'm serious, leave me alone.

1221
01:25:50.931 --> 01:25:53.402
We don't need to fight.
You're better than this.

1222
01:25:54.802 --> 01:25:57.069
No, we're not.

1223
01:25:57.071 --> 01:25:59.840
Okay, you asked for it.

1224
01:26:01.275 --> 01:26:03.844
What are you're going to
do, whistle us to death?

1225
01:26:03.846 --> 01:26:06.049
Just calling in the troops.

1226
01:26:07.815 --> 01:26:11.252
Remember, I gave you a chance to walk away.

1227
01:26:12.589 --> 01:26:15.892
Look what we have here. We're terrified!

1228
01:26:26.269 --> 01:26:27.535
Thanks, Wilbur.

1229
01:26:27.537 --> 01:26:29.271
Just doing my part.

1230
01:26:29.273 --> 01:26:32.574
Girls, Daddy is very proud of you.

1231
01:26:32.576 --> 01:26:34.212
What are you smiling about?

1232
01:26:36.547 --> 01:26:39.452
No. You didn't. Let's check them out.

1233
01:26:56.502 --> 01:26:58.571
Whoa. Don't mess with these girls.

1234
01:26:58.573 --> 01:27:01.407
They take after their old man.

1235
01:27:01.409 --> 01:27:03.375
Now you better get back inside

1236
01:27:03.377 --> 01:27:06.744
before somebody reports a giant
bear terrorizing kids in the city.

1237
01:27:06.746 --> 01:27:07.749
Hi, Adam.

1238
01:27:09.217 --> 01:27:10.684
Hi, there.

1239
01:27:10.686 --> 01:27:12.118
What was that all about?

1240
01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.221
Well...

1241
01:27:14.223 --> 01:27:16.389
Do you want to walk to school with me?

1242
01:27:16.391 --> 01:27:17.658
I'll tell you on the way.

1243
01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:20.496
I'd love to. I thought you'd never ask.

1244
01:27:21.563 --> 01:27:23.463
Cool.

1245
01:27:25.067 --> 01:27:26.366
No, not again.

1246
01:27:26.368 --> 01:27:29.402
Whoa, what's with the feet?

1247
01:27:29.404 --> 01:27:32.740
You're really different. I like that.

1248
01:27:32.742 --> 01:27:35.847
Maybe it'd be better
if I switch to sandals.

1249
01:27:37.247 --> 01:27:39.046
We better hurry, we're going to be late.

1250
01:27:39.048 --> 01:27:42.284
Slow down, we've got plenty of time.

1251
01:27:42.286 --> 01:27:44.286
I really do want to hear your story.

1252
01:27:44.288 --> 01:27:47.025
Well, where do I start?
