00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:46.773
Oh, that's it! Spindle, taillight.

3
00:01:57.034 --> 00:01:58.994
Hey. Hey!

4
00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:01.663
-What?
-What do you mean, "what"?

5
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.124
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?

6
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:08.003
Yeah, this is the sleeping chamber.
Go to sleep.

7
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.963
Don't make me come up there!

8
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.885
I'm so sorry, but I must have
the final ingredient for my potion.

9
00:02:15.052 --> 00:02:16.762
Now, what's more important:

10
00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:22.851
Me completing my life's work
for the salvation of the colony--

11
00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:24.811
Which includes you guys.

12
00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.105
--or your sleep?

13
00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:29.900
-Sleep. I'm going with sleep.
-Yeah, the second one.

14
00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:33.278
Well, then I shall try to be very quiet.

15
00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:35.197
Clacktiel.

16
00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:41.245
That's it, I'm coming up there!

17
00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.498
Fire crystals.

18
00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:48.877
At last. The final ingredient.

19
00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:55.551
I'm on vacation.

20
00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:01.139
-No. No, cut it out.
-Dogpile.

21
00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:03.183
Dogpile.

22
00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:09.022
It's the Destroyer!

23
00:03:14.862 --> 00:03:16.613
Atomic wedgy.

24
00:03:17.573 --> 00:03:18.991
And a clean break.

25
00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:21.368
-Clean break. Excellent wedge.
-Yeah. All right.

26
00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:24.162
Come on, man,
I'm running out of underwear.

27
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.665
Well, what are you gonna do about it, huh?
Nothing.

28
00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:31.712
-Because I'm big and you're small.
-Yeah.

29
00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.967
-Because he's big and you're small.
-Hey.

30
00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:39.845
Quit repeating everything I say.

31
00:03:40.012 --> 00:03:42.014
I was just adding emphasis, dude.

32
00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.975
Man, why you gotta be hating?

33
00:04:02.034 --> 00:04:03.160
Destroyer.

34
00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:18.509
Zoc?

35
00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:21.178
Water!

36
00:04:21.345 --> 00:04:23.388
-Zoc.
-Hova, please, get to the grass.

37
00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:24.973
It's dangerous up here.

38
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.643
But I've always wanted to see
a human up close.

39
00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:30.145
I hear they're capable of speech, like us.

40
00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:32.981
They are nothing like us.

41
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.740
What you gonna do about it, ants?
Nothing.

42
00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:45.452
Because I'm big and you're small.

43
00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:50.582
Away, monster, or I will use my powers
to destroy you.

44
00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.381
Powers that I have yet to perfect. Run!

45
00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:06.890
Hello.

46
00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:10.435
We mean you no harm.

47
00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:11.937
-Oh, great.
-Shoe!

48
00:05:12.104 --> 00:05:13.814
Shoe!

49
00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:23.448
-Please, go in peace.
-Look out!

50
00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:32.082
-Are you all right?
-l-- I guess he didn't hear me.

51
00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.002
Lucas.

52
00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.462
Peanut, it's time to come inside now.

53
00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:46.513
Peanut.

54
00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:49.683
I think I might have gotten through
to him.

55
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.604
-What do you think?
-Destroyer.

56
00:05:55.647 --> 00:05:58.066
Tiffany, Lucas, we're leaving now.

57
00:05:58.317 --> 00:06:00.986
Lucas? All the numbers are on the fridge.

58
00:06:01.153 --> 00:06:04.698
<i>-Good one. Extended play.
-Lucas.</i>

59
00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:09.203
What are you doing back there?
Why didn't you answer?

60
00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:11.830
-Are you all right, sweetie?
-I'm fine.

61
00:06:11.997 --> 00:06:15.375
-I was just playing with my friends.
-I don't know.

62
00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:19.171
-Maybe we shouldn't go on vacation.
-Come on, it's our big wedding anniversary.

63
00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.131
We're going to Puerco Vallarta.

64
00:06:21.298 --> 00:06:26.011
<i>And I gotta spend a little quality time
with the mamacita.</i>

65
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.223
Don't cancel your vacation
just because of me.

66
00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:33.352
-I can solve my own problems.
-Problems? What problems?

67
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.522
Does it have anything to do with
why I can't find your underwear?

68
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:37.940
No!

69
00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:41.068
Bed-wetting is nothing
to be ashamed of, Peanut.

70
00:06:41.235 --> 00:06:43.153
What? Just stop it, Mom!

71
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.365
I don't have any problems
except for you treating me like a baby.

72
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.993
-Peanut.
-And stop calling me that.

73
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.788
Just go away and leave me alone.

74
00:06:57.417 --> 00:07:00.128
I, Zoc, call upon the elements:

75
00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:05.092
The wind that blows, rain that falls,
fire that burns.

76
00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:09.471
Deliver your awesome power
and transform my potion.

77
00:07:09.638 --> 00:07:11.390
Clacktiel.

78
00:07:14.935 --> 00:07:16.979
That was great, sweetie.

79
00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:20.649
I loved the smoke effects.
Didn't you, Spindle?

80
00:07:21.233 --> 00:07:22.568
You...

81
00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:24.611
...rock. Curse upon your children.

82
00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:27.406
I don't think rocks have children, honey.

83
00:07:28.532 --> 00:07:31.910
-They won't now.
-Okay. What's the matter?

84
00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:34.371
Hova, the potion is supposed to
change color.

85
00:07:34.538 --> 00:07:38.000
It's not changing color.
It's not changing color.

86
00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:40.460
I call upon the elements:
Wind, rain, et cetera.

87
00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:43.172
Transform my potion and clacktiel.

88
00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:48.468
Clacktiel, clacktiel....

89
00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:52.764
-Maybe you're pronouncing it wrong.
-How could I pronounce it wrong?

90
00:07:52.973 --> 00:07:56.143
-I made it up.
-Take a break.

91
00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.936
Hova, perhaps you didn't notice...

92
00:07:58.145 --> 00:08:02.107
...but we were almost squished today,
and the colony is in shambles.

93
00:08:02.316 --> 00:08:06.403
I am this close to finding a solution
to the human problem...

94
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.114
...and you tell me I need to--
Hova, what are you doing?

95
00:08:09.323 --> 00:08:11.283
-Nothing, I'm not doing anything.
-No. Wait.

96
00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.327
-No.
-I'm simply walking towards you.

97
00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.746
-There's no reason to panic.
-Wait. Now, Hova--

98
00:08:15.913 --> 00:08:18.373
-I'm just coming towards you.
-Wait. No. Hova. No.

99
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.792
Does it tickle?
What about when I do this?

100
00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:22.920
Why are you laughing?
I see you laughing.

101
00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:25.130
Don't make me clacktiel you.

102
00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:29.510
Well, I'm glad you two have something
to laugh about.

103
00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:33.138
-Head of Council.
-Hi.

104
00:08:33.347 --> 00:08:36.683
How nice of you to....
It was unexpected.

105
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.478
Forgive me.
I was working on an experiment.

106
00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:41.855
Oh, yes, I see.

107
00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:45.609
Well, we were-- How may I be of service?

108
00:08:45.776 --> 00:08:48.987
Zoc, attacks from the Destroyer
grow more frequent.

109
00:08:49.196 --> 00:08:51.949
Our food supplies
are now desperately low.

110
00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:56.787
The council was hoping
perhaps you might have a solution.

111
00:08:57.746 --> 00:09:00.415
Fight back. We must stop the Destroyer.

112
00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:02.876
But thousands of ants
would needlessly die.

113
00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:06.797
Perhaps if we could communicate,
you know, just talk with the human.

114
00:09:06.964 --> 00:09:10.509
Oh, what a great idea.
Let's have a nice chat.

115
00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:14.012
Well, hello, Destroyer.
Gee, you look kind of tired.

116
00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:16.640
Why don't you just rest your feet
on my girlfriend.

117
00:09:16.849 --> 00:09:18.058
Okay, oka--

118
00:09:18.225 --> 00:09:20.727
Sometimes you're a real stinkbug,
you know that?

119
00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:26.024
Zoc, a war with the human is--
It's impossible.

120
00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:30.696
A wizard knows no such word.

121
00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:38.453
-Whatever.
-Bye, Tiff. Bye, Lucas.

122
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.039
I love you.

123
00:09:42.875 --> 00:09:45.002
You kids mind your grandma.

124
00:09:45.169 --> 00:09:47.421
Okay, goodbye. Have fun.

125
00:09:47.588 --> 00:09:50.799
Don't worry, everything's under control.

126
00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:58.015
A little help, please.

127
00:09:58.223 --> 00:10:00.809
I think it's your turn.

128
00:10:00.976 --> 00:10:02.936
Teeth in the grass.

129
00:10:04.313 --> 00:10:08.358
Mommo, here's your--
What are you doing?

130
00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:12.613
Preventing alien abduction,
that's what I'm doing.

131
00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.781
Thank you.

132
00:10:16.408 --> 00:10:18.702
Dang crabgrass.

133
00:10:18.869 --> 00:10:23.290
See these? Airflow. Aliens hate airflow.

134
00:10:24.041 --> 00:10:28.670
Drives them nuts. And if they try to cut
the power in the middle of the night...

135
00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:33.383
...these babies will wake me up.

136
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:37.721
-We gotta be prepared. Tell your friends.
-I don't have any friends.

137
00:10:37.888 --> 00:10:40.349
Well, who's gonna look out for you
when you get old...

138
00:10:40.516 --> 00:10:44.520
...and your teeth are falling out,
and them aliens are after you?

139
00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:48.315
-Lucas.
-I'll look after myself.

140
00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:52.903
-Good night, Mommo.
-Good night. Sleep tight.

141
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.113
Don't let the bedbugs bite...

142
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.450
...or creep into your ear
and lay eggs in your brain.

143
00:11:13.257 --> 00:11:16.802
-Dance, Pukas.
-Dance, monkey boy, dance!

144
00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:19.137
Think fast.

145
00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:42.786
Clacktiel.

146
00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:47.833
You....

147
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.669
Zoc, please, not in front of Spindle.

148
00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:53.630
Sorry.

149
00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:58.343
God, there must be something I missed.

150
00:11:58.677 --> 00:12:00.679
Wait. A crack.

151
00:12:00.888 --> 00:12:03.974
That's it. Imperfections in the crystals.

152
00:12:04.141 --> 00:12:07.060
Perhaps coating it
in a viscous compound.

153
00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:09.188
Spindle. Resin.

154
00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:18.906
Clacktiel.

155
00:12:24.203 --> 00:12:28.916
Oh, that's it. It worked!
The potion is complete!

156
00:12:29.458 --> 00:12:34.213
Praise the Mother! Yes! Yes! Yes!

157
00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:35.797
No!

158
00:12:37.758 --> 00:12:40.719
-Zoc.
-Hova, hang on.

159
00:12:41.178 --> 00:12:44.723
Spindle, get the potion. Quickly.

160
00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:16.839
Hello.

161
00:13:18.215 --> 00:13:23.637
Yep, I was about your age
when I flooded my first colony.

162
00:13:23.971 --> 00:13:28.392
Brother, those were good times.
Good times!

163
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.771
-Who are you?
-Stan Beals is the name.

164
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.648
Beals-A-Bug Pest Control.

165
00:13:36.233 --> 00:13:38.944
Exterminator, eradicator,
solver of problems.

166
00:13:39.111 --> 00:13:41.780
Hey, you must be the Nickle boy, right?

167
00:13:41.989 --> 00:13:43.991
Now, your dad ordered my services...

168
00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:46.785
...but he forgot to sign the contract
before he left.

169
00:13:46.994 --> 00:13:49.955
Busy man. Lot on his mind. It happens.

170
00:13:50.122 --> 00:13:53.166
So he just told me to talk to you....

171
00:13:53.417 --> 00:13:56.336
-Lucas.
-Yeah, Lucas.

172
00:13:56.503 --> 00:14:00.257
He said, "You have my son, Lucas,
sign the contract for me...

173
00:14:00.424 --> 00:14:04.469
...if I happen to forget to before I leave.
He's a grown man now."

174
00:14:04.636 --> 00:14:06.638
His exact words.

175
00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:10.684
I don't know.
Do you have any references?

176
00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:13.270
References?

177
00:14:13.437 --> 00:14:15.189
There's one.

178
00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:19.359
I don't think I should.

179
00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:24.573
You don't think you should, huh?
You don't think?

180
00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.285
So who does your thinking for you?
Your mommy?

181
00:14:28.452 --> 00:14:30.913
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy,
what do I do?

182
00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:33.957
I'm just a little baby
that can't think for myself.

183
00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:35.876
Please wipe my little bottom for me.

184
00:14:36.043 --> 00:14:40.172
Wipe me. Oh, oh, please, wipe me.

185
00:14:41.298 --> 00:14:45.344
-Give me that stupid contract.
-Yes, sir. A very mature decision.

186
00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:47.971
<i>Enjoy a world that's entirely bug free</i>

187
00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:52.184
<i>Just sign right here
And leave the killing to me</i>

188
00:14:52.351 --> 00:14:54.269
I wrote that.

189
00:15:08.784 --> 00:15:11.328
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

190
00:15:11.495 --> 00:15:14.540
Spindle? Spindle?

191
00:15:15.916 --> 00:15:18.877
Spindle. You saved it.

192
00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:21.213
Oh, well, come here.

193
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.341
Well, someone's getting
an extra moldy root tonight.

194
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:26.677
-Okay, okay.
-Zoc.

195
00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:31.765
Spindle, light.

196
00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:41.942
-Mother, help us.
-Oh, no.

197
00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:45.863
To attack without provocation,
without reason...

198
00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:50.242
...just because they can, it's--
It's barbaric.

199
00:15:51.034 --> 00:15:53.412
But what can we do?

200
00:15:53.871 --> 00:15:56.081
We are lost.

201
00:15:56.623 --> 00:15:59.626
No. We are saved.

202
00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:02.921
This is our salvation.

203
00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.257
A potion?

204
00:16:05.424 --> 00:16:09.970
What exactly does it do?

205
00:17:41.937 --> 00:17:43.230
Hey. Hey, hey.

206
00:18:02.708 --> 00:18:06.044
Human. Come with us.

207
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.052
Shoo. Shoo. Get away. Get away.

208
00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:17.347
I got a fan. I'm windy.

209
00:18:18.307 --> 00:18:20.017
I am windy.

210
00:18:23.937 --> 00:18:25.856
Hello?

211
00:18:26.023 --> 00:18:27.900
Hello?

212
00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:32.696
Hello?

213
00:18:34.907 --> 00:18:38.452
Scanning. Scanning. Scanning.

214
00:18:39.244 --> 00:18:41.246
Stop! Hey, come on! Cut it out!

215
00:18:41.413 --> 00:18:44.917
What are you doing out of bed,
tiny Lucas?

216
00:18:55.636 --> 00:18:58.472
Who are you? What did you do to me?
Let me go!

217
00:19:26.792 --> 00:19:29.294
Gross. Hey, cut it out.

218
00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:49.356
Put me down! Hey. Stop. Put me down.

219
00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:55.654
Put me down!

220
00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.328
What is that? Oh, he smells.

221
00:20:03.495 --> 00:20:06.832
-It's the human.
-It's Peanut, the Destroyer.

222
00:20:09.168 --> 00:20:11.044
Oh, my.

223
00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:14.339
-All right, Peanut, this way.
-It's small.

224
00:20:14.506 --> 00:20:15.841
-What is it?
-Touch it.

225
00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:17.009
-Don't touch it.
-Hey.

226
00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:20.179
-Poke it.
-He's so soft.

227
00:20:20.345 --> 00:20:24.725
-His skeleton is on the inside.
-He's inside out?

228
00:20:31.565 --> 00:20:34.318
Where are you taking me? Help!

229
00:20:36.195 --> 00:20:39.198
Who are you? What did you do to me?
Let me go!

230
00:20:41.992 --> 00:20:43.243
Human...

231
00:20:44.036 --> 00:20:46.997
...you have been brought
before the council...

232
00:20:47.164 --> 00:20:50.959
...to face judgment
for crimes against the colony.

233
00:20:51.126 --> 00:20:52.377
Read the charges.

234
00:20:53.212 --> 00:20:55.506
"This human-destructor beast...

235
00:20:55.672 --> 00:20:59.009
...hereafter referred to
as Peanut the Destroyer...

236
00:20:59.176 --> 00:21:01.887
...did willfully
and with malice aforethought...

237
00:21:02.054 --> 00:21:04.723
...crush the food-storage chambers...

238
00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:07.267
...flood all of the lower
hatching chambers...

239
00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:13.065
...and douse the colony
with the dreaded yellow rain."

240
00:21:13.232 --> 00:21:15.234
Hey, come on, I had to go.

241
00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.905
Sentencing of the human
will be handed down...

242
00:21:20.072 --> 00:21:22.741
...by the queen herself.

243
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:35.546
Greetings, my children...

244
00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:40.092
...and to our unusual guest...

245
00:21:40.259 --> 00:21:45.514
...a human that threatens
the very existence of our colony.

246
00:21:45.681 --> 00:21:48.642
Wait a second! Wait, wait, wait.
Time out.

247
00:21:48.809 --> 00:21:53.063
How was I supposed to know
ants had feelings or families or trials?

248
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:56.984
-You're just a bunch of stupid ants.
-Destroy the Destroyer!

249
00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.736
-Throw him in the pit.
-Let's eat him!

250
00:21:59.903 --> 00:22:03.615
No, wait. We are not mindless savages.

251
00:22:03.824 --> 00:22:05.951
This human should be studied.

252
00:22:06.118 --> 00:22:07.703
-And then we'll eat him.
-Yeah.

253
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:10.914
Eat! Eat! Eat!

254
00:22:11.331 --> 00:22:13.917
Order. Order.

255
00:22:14.334 --> 00:22:16.461
Be still, be still.

256
00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:20.299
Tonight we have a choice.

257
00:22:20.465 --> 00:22:25.846
We could destroy this human
and make safe this day.

258
00:22:26.013 --> 00:22:30.809
Or we could change
the nature of this human...

259
00:22:30.976 --> 00:22:36.648
...and perhaps create
a brighter future for all ants.

260
00:22:36.815 --> 00:22:41.904
I therefore sentence the human
to live and work in the colony...

261
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:47.159
...to learn our ways.
He must become an ant.

262
00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:51.330
-What?
-No. No, my queen.

263
00:22:51.747 --> 00:22:55.876
What if he does not become an ant?

264
00:22:56.043 --> 00:22:58.337
Okay, I mean, come on.

265
00:22:58.754 --> 00:23:01.381
That would be regrettable.

266
00:23:02.299 --> 00:23:05.344
But-- But who will teach him our ways?

267
00:23:06.512 --> 00:23:08.972
-I will.
-Hova?

268
00:23:09.181 --> 00:23:10.641
It is done.

269
00:23:10.807 --> 00:23:13.852
Let us continue our work.

270
00:23:15.145 --> 00:23:17.648
That's it?
How long am I gonna be like this?

271
00:23:17.814 --> 00:23:19.066
I wanna go home.

272
00:23:19.233 --> 00:23:21.026
Wait. This is inhuman.

273
00:23:22.069 --> 00:23:24.655
Yes, it is.

274
00:23:27.574 --> 00:23:29.701
Hello, Peanut?

275
00:23:30.536 --> 00:23:32.538
Destroyer?

276
00:23:32.955 --> 00:23:35.332
Hello? We have to go.

277
00:23:35.958 --> 00:23:38.418
It's time to start your training.

278
00:23:39.336 --> 00:23:41.255
Where are you?

279
00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:46.885
Okay, okay. It's simple.

280
00:23:47.052 --> 00:23:50.097
All I have to do is run past the guards,
then escape the anthill...

281
00:23:50.264 --> 00:23:53.267
-...and not get eaten by anything.
-Well, hello there.

282
00:23:53.433 --> 00:23:55.769
You know, there's a million things
I wanna ask you.

283
00:23:55.936 --> 00:23:58.939
When were you hatched?
Are you--? Are you male or female?

284
00:23:59.481 --> 00:24:01.066
And how do you tell the difference?

285
00:24:01.275 --> 00:24:04.069
Is it--? Oh, is that how?

286
00:24:04.278 --> 00:24:08.574
Hey, stop peeking.
Or-- Or I'll stomp on you.

287
00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:12.494
Well, I wouldn't if I were you.
You see, I'm the only friend you've got.

288
00:24:12.661 --> 00:24:13.787
You're gonna eat me.

289
00:24:14.204 --> 00:24:17.416
You know, now that you mention it,
you do look soft and chewy...

290
00:24:17.624 --> 00:24:20.085
...but I promised the queen I wouldn't.

291
00:24:21.503 --> 00:24:22.754
Cross your heart.

292
00:24:22.921 --> 00:24:24.548
What? Oh, all right.

293
00:24:24.715 --> 00:24:26.717
Cross my heart, I will not eat you.

294
00:24:27.467 --> 00:24:29.636
I said, cross your heart, not your butt.

295
00:24:29.803 --> 00:24:31.597
I just did.

296
00:24:31.805 --> 00:24:34.016
See, there, did it again.

297
00:24:34.183 --> 00:24:35.434
Strange custom.

298
00:24:35.809 --> 00:24:37.311
I'm still not going.

299
00:24:37.477 --> 00:24:40.397
-Peanut, you need to--
-My name's Lucas, not Peanut.

300
00:24:40.564 --> 00:24:42.274
Lucas.

301
00:24:42.482 --> 00:24:45.485
Well, Lucas. You heard the queen.

302
00:24:45.652 --> 00:24:48.363
You must become an ant
if you ever want to return home.

303
00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.490
And how am I supposed to do that?

304
00:24:50.657 --> 00:24:53.160
Well, you just have
to find your place in the colony.

305
00:25:03.587 --> 00:25:07.174
So, Lucas,
do you have any special skills?

306
00:25:07.341 --> 00:25:09.843
I can make milk come out
of my sister's nose.

307
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:13.805
Okay, well, let's try foraging.

308
00:25:13.972 --> 00:25:15.933
The instructor
is a personal friend of mine.

309
00:25:16.141 --> 00:25:18.268
I'm sure she'd love to help.

310
00:25:18.435 --> 00:25:20.646
Peanut? The Destroyer?

311
00:25:20.812 --> 00:25:22.940
I had to move out
of my nest because of you.

312
00:25:23.106 --> 00:25:24.691
I lost everything.

313
00:25:24.858 --> 00:25:27.152
Took me all morning to rebuild.

314
00:25:27.319 --> 00:25:31.990
Hova, don't tell me
that you are mentoring this-- This-- This....

315
00:25:32.533 --> 00:25:34.284
It's Lucas.

316
00:25:36.203 --> 00:25:39.623
Why is he covered in trash? Is he crazy?
Because I don't teach crazy ants.

317
00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:43.335
No, no, no. He calls the trash "clothes."

318
00:25:43.502 --> 00:25:45.504
They like keeping
their gender traits hidden.

319
00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.382
He's male.

320
00:25:49.383 --> 00:25:52.302
Okay, Lucas, you're on the blue team.

321
00:25:52.469 --> 00:25:54.137
-Oh, man. That's not fair.
-Come on.

322
00:25:54.304 --> 00:25:56.348
Hey, hey, hey, quiet.

323
00:25:56.515 --> 00:25:59.142
And suck in that thorax.

324
00:25:59.309 --> 00:26:03.647
Like everything in the colony,
foraging is a team effort.

325
00:26:03.814 --> 00:26:09.862
In this test, each team must act
as a single unit to avoid obstacles...

326
00:26:10.028 --> 00:26:13.740
...retrieve the sweet rock
and return to the nest.

327
00:26:13.907 --> 00:26:16.994
No ant gets left behind.

328
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.745
First team back wins.

329
00:26:18.912 --> 00:26:20.914
Any questions?

330
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.546
-Hello, baby.
-Fugax.

331
00:26:27.754 --> 00:26:31.717
Well, isn't it true that scout ants,
such as myself...

332
00:26:31.925 --> 00:26:36.346
...lead an exciting life of adventure
and intrigue.

333
00:26:36.847 --> 00:26:40.350
-Fugax!
-While foragers, such as you...

334
00:26:40.517 --> 00:26:43.729
...just walk around and pick up sticks.

335
00:26:46.106 --> 00:26:47.357
Questions, anyone?

336
00:26:47.524 --> 00:26:49.693
-Oh, sir?
-The guy with the crooked mandibles.

337
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.361
What kind of adventures?

338
00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.906
Well, I'm glad you asked.

339
00:26:54.114 --> 00:26:57.492
-Fugax.
-Gather round, young scouts.

340
00:26:57.659 --> 00:27:03.207
In my travels, I have journeyed
far beyond the great flat rock.

341
00:27:04.708 --> 00:27:06.251
You mean, the street?

342
00:27:06.793 --> 00:27:09.588
No. The great flat rock...

343
00:27:09.755 --> 00:27:14.760
...where the humans
ride in their giant metal cocoons.

344
00:27:15.177 --> 00:27:16.428
Cars.

345
00:27:17.304 --> 00:27:18.597
Did I call on you?

346
00:27:18.764 --> 00:27:21.016
Who invited Captain Party Pooper?

347
00:27:21.183 --> 00:27:23.060
Fugax, meet the Destroyer.

348
00:27:23.227 --> 00:27:24.603
Destroyer?

349
00:27:31.902 --> 00:27:34.905
Now, are there any other--?

350
00:27:37.115 --> 00:27:40.452
Are there any other questions
about your assignment?

351
00:27:40.619 --> 00:27:43.455
Yeah, what's a sweet rock?

352
00:27:43.664 --> 00:27:45.165
Go.

353
00:27:51.922 --> 00:27:53.382
-Bridge.
-Stack up.

354
00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:55.008
Bridge, hooyah.

355
00:27:55.175 --> 00:27:56.385
Come on, Peanut.

356
00:27:56.552 --> 00:27:59.680
Hello, I can do it myself.

357
00:28:03.475 --> 00:28:05.936
Hey, guys. I think he's dead.

358
00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.480
I'm not dead.

359
00:28:08.856 --> 00:28:11.275
-Ladder.
-Ladder, hooyah.

360
00:28:11.692 --> 00:28:13.986
-Come on.
-Grab hold.

361
00:28:14.194 --> 00:28:16.154
I don't need your help.

362
00:28:16.321 --> 00:28:18.365
I need your help! I need your help!

363
00:28:18.532 --> 00:28:20.742
Bye, losers.

364
00:28:21.326 --> 00:28:23.078
Come on.

365
00:28:26.123 --> 00:28:28.417
-All right.
-Hurry, human.

366
00:28:28.584 --> 00:28:29.793
You're gonna make us lose.

367
00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.212
Hey. I've only got two legs.

368
00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.507
Go, Two Legs, go.

369
00:28:35.716 --> 00:28:37.009
Go, Lucas.

370
00:28:37.176 --> 00:28:39.469
-Spring.
-Spring, hooyah.

371
00:28:39.636 --> 00:28:41.555
Hooyah.

372
00:28:43.056 --> 00:28:45.017
Oh, time out.

373
00:28:45.225 --> 00:28:47.144
I don't think I can do this--

374
00:28:47.311 --> 00:28:48.478
All right.

375
00:28:50.731 --> 00:28:53.817
-Let me off!
-Don't let go!

376
00:28:54.234 --> 00:28:55.861
I'm gonna be sick.

377
00:28:56.069 --> 00:28:57.696
Don't let go.

378
00:28:57.863 --> 00:29:00.032
-I'm letting go.
-Don't let go.

379
00:29:03.243 --> 00:29:04.244
He let go.

380
00:29:10.584 --> 00:29:13.295
-A jellybean?
-All right, Lucas.

381
00:29:13.462 --> 00:29:15.214
Good thinking.

382
00:29:15.964 --> 00:29:17.758
Slingshot, hooyah.

383
00:29:26.016 --> 00:29:28.685
-All right, Lucas. Good job.
-Yeah, Peanut, you rule.

384
00:29:28.852 --> 00:29:31.939
-Come on, we're losing. Let's go.
-Good job, Lucas.

385
00:29:32.105 --> 00:29:33.732
-Did we win yet?
-Almost.

386
00:29:33.899 --> 00:29:36.818
We just have to get the sweet rock
over the finish line.

387
00:29:36.985 --> 00:29:38.195
Come on, let's go.

388
00:29:39.571 --> 00:29:41.907
Hurry up, Peanut.

389
00:29:42.282 --> 00:29:45.035
Yeah, right.

390
00:29:45.202 --> 00:29:47.079
Hurry, Lucas, climb the wall.

391
00:29:47.287 --> 00:29:48.539
Climb fast, Peanut.

392
00:29:48.705 --> 00:29:49.915
They're catching up.

393
00:29:50.332 --> 00:29:51.959
Bye-bye, loser.

394
00:29:52.125 --> 00:29:53.710
Climb the wall.

395
00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.713
Come on. Climb the wall.

396
00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.507
Come on.

397
00:29:59.216 --> 00:30:01.426
Forget it. This game is rigged.

398
00:30:02.052 --> 00:30:03.595
-Ladder.
-Hooyah.

399
00:30:03.804 --> 00:30:07.724
Come on. Let's go. Go, go, go.

400
00:30:07.933 --> 00:30:09.893
We got it. We go it. Yeah, man. All right.

401
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.478
Red rules.

402
00:30:13.814 --> 00:30:15.315
Red team wins.

403
00:30:15.691 --> 00:30:18.527
All right. We did it.

404
00:30:20.988 --> 00:30:23.240
Thanks for trying.

405
00:30:35.002 --> 00:30:37.004
Lucas, you did fine, really.

406
00:30:37.171 --> 00:30:39.631
You just need to discover the ant within.

407
00:30:39.798 --> 00:30:42.134
Start by visualizing yourself with six legs.

408
00:30:42.342 --> 00:30:44.428
-Then, if you--
-How's that gonna get me home?

409
00:30:44.595 --> 00:30:47.097
Look at me. I'm not a stupid ant.

410
00:30:47.264 --> 00:30:51.101
Lucas, being an ant means more
than just having six legs or--

411
00:30:51.268 --> 00:30:54.646
Or lifting 10 times your own weight
or walking vertically up a wall...

412
00:30:54.813 --> 00:30:58.317
...it's being part of a colony.
Not always thinking of yourself first.

413
00:30:58.525 --> 00:31:00.819
-Oh, careful.
-Hey, don't touch me.

414
00:31:00.986 --> 00:31:03.030
I'm trying to help you.

415
00:31:03.197 --> 00:31:04.573
You think this is easy for me?

416
00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.992
Being the Destroyer's little helper?

417
00:31:07.159 --> 00:31:10.996
So you worry about you,
and I'll worry about me.

418
00:31:11.413 --> 00:31:13.081
Oh, Lucas.

419
00:31:13.248 --> 00:31:14.875
That's not the way ants are.

420
00:31:15.042 --> 00:31:18.295
Oh, Hova, that's the way I am.

421
00:31:18.462 --> 00:31:21.215
Well, if I could just--

422
00:31:23.008 --> 00:31:24.176
Just what?

423
00:31:24.676 --> 00:31:27.804
Hello? Earth to ant lady.

424
00:31:27.971 --> 00:31:30.307
You were in the middle
of sounding like my mom.

425
00:31:30.766 --> 00:31:33.185
They're coming. Run!

426
00:31:34.228 --> 00:31:36.230
Hey. Hey! What's wrong?

427
00:31:42.319 --> 00:31:44.988
-They're after the herd.
-What herd?

428
00:31:47.366 --> 00:31:48.825
Whoa, easy, girl.

429
00:31:49.034 --> 00:31:50.744
Easy.

430
00:31:53.205 --> 00:31:54.873
Take cover.

431
00:31:57.501 --> 00:31:59.503
Tell the queen I love her.

432
00:32:01.171 --> 00:32:02.673
Oh, we're cut off.

433
00:32:06.426 --> 00:32:10.806
Come, brothers, for queen and colony.

434
00:32:18.689 --> 00:32:20.566
Get to the grass.

435
00:32:21.108 --> 00:32:22.401
Attack formation.

436
00:32:22.818 --> 00:32:24.570
Load them up.

437
00:32:27.114 --> 00:32:30.117
-Enemy fire.
-Watch your wing. Watch your wing.

438
00:32:30.284 --> 00:32:32.411
-Now, that's gotta sting.
-Nice shot.

439
00:32:34.079 --> 00:32:35.455
My turn.

440
00:32:35.914 --> 00:32:37.749
-Thanks.
-Where's Hova?

441
00:32:37.916 --> 00:32:39.626
I don't know.

442
00:32:39.835 --> 00:32:41.378
Come on.

443
00:32:41.795 --> 00:32:44.423
To your positions. Ready.

444
00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:47.926
Squirt.

445
00:32:56.727 --> 00:32:59.438
Don't.
Please, I was just following orders.

446
00:33:00.898 --> 00:33:02.107
Who wants magic?

447
00:33:02.274 --> 00:33:03.942
Clacktiel.

448
00:33:09.072 --> 00:33:10.490
You look tasty.

449
00:33:10.657 --> 00:33:12.075
Leave him alone.

450
00:33:14.995 --> 00:33:17.247
Hova? Oh, quick, get out of my way.

451
00:33:17.414 --> 00:33:18.582
Move.

452
00:33:18.749 --> 00:33:21.126
-Hova.
-Hurry.

453
00:33:21.293 --> 00:33:22.669
Everyone, into the grass.

454
00:33:23.212 --> 00:33:25.255
Don't just stand there. Help her.

455
00:33:26.256 --> 00:33:28.050
Lucas, run.

456
00:33:28.217 --> 00:33:29.426
What are you doing?

457
00:33:33.972 --> 00:33:35.432
Everyone, into the grass.

458
00:34:00.207 --> 00:34:02.125
Where are you...

459
00:34:02.292 --> 00:34:04.169
...little bug?

460
00:34:24.648 --> 00:34:27.025
Please, hurry up. Light, light.

461
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:31.864
Light, light.

462
00:34:42.416 --> 00:34:43.542
Hova, get down.

463
00:34:44.585 --> 00:34:46.211
Zoc.

464
00:34:51.258 --> 00:34:53.468
No!

465
00:34:54.928 --> 00:34:56.388
Stop, hey! No, no.

466
00:35:06.481 --> 00:35:07.774
Fire in the hole!

467
00:35:16.825 --> 00:35:19.036
-What was that?
-It's bath time.

468
00:35:19.203 --> 00:35:20.287
Retreat.

469
00:35:32.299 --> 00:35:33.425
They're leaving.

470
00:35:33.634 --> 00:35:34.927
We-- We won.

471
00:35:38.388 --> 00:35:40.891
All hail the Destroyer.

472
00:35:41.058 --> 00:35:42.476
Peanut! Peanut!

473
00:35:42.643 --> 00:35:44.102
Brilliant. Genius.

474
00:35:44.269 --> 00:35:45.729
I mean, Lucas made a:

475
00:35:45.938 --> 00:35:48.398
And then...they all flew away.

476
00:35:48.565 --> 00:35:50.817
And now I know
why they call you Peanut.

477
00:35:50.984 --> 00:35:54.321
He's got a brain the size of a peanut.

478
00:35:54.488 --> 00:35:56.156
Lucas the Destroyer.

479
00:35:56.573 --> 00:35:59.243
I take back everything
I thought about you.

480
00:35:59.409 --> 00:36:00.911
You saved us.

481
00:36:01.328 --> 00:36:03.413
Thank you, Lucas.

482
00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:06.291
Yeah, sure.

483
00:36:07.543 --> 00:36:09.419
He saved us.

484
00:36:09.586 --> 00:36:13.465
Oh, it's so obvious, I was so dumb.

485
00:36:13.632 --> 00:36:16.134
Praise the Destroyer.

486
00:36:16.343 --> 00:36:18.637
Wake up. He saved himself.

487
00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:20.848
The rest of us just--

488
00:36:21.723 --> 00:36:23.976
Just got in the way.

489
00:36:24.434 --> 00:36:26.603
Zoc. Oh, are you all right?

490
00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:28.230
-No, I'm--
-What happened to you?

491
00:36:28.397 --> 00:36:29.940
I'm fine. I'm fine.

492
00:36:30.107 --> 00:36:32.359
-You're hurt.
-No, it's nothing, really, I just--

493
00:36:32.526 --> 00:36:34.361
Zoc, do you have any yucca sap?

494
00:36:34.528 --> 00:36:37.781
Lucas has a burn. Poor baby.

495
00:36:38.699 --> 00:36:41.535
This is our enemy.

496
00:36:41.952 --> 00:36:45.497
They do not save ants, they kill ants.

497
00:36:45.664 --> 00:36:48.125
He very nearly killed me.

498
00:36:49.126 --> 00:36:51.295
Or does that not matter to you?

499
00:37:00.846 --> 00:37:04.308
<i>I do, you do
We all like the honeydew</i>

500
00:37:04.516 --> 00:37:05.976
Dinner is served.

501
00:37:06.185 --> 00:37:07.644
And I'm the dessert.

502
00:37:07.811 --> 00:37:10.397
And I'm on a low-fathead diet.

503
00:37:10.564 --> 00:37:12.900
And you know, it looks good on you.

504
00:37:13.066 --> 00:37:14.818
So, Lucas, what are you working on?

505
00:37:14.985 --> 00:37:15.986
Glasses.

506
00:37:18.488 --> 00:37:21.325
This is some good honeydew.

507
00:37:23.285 --> 00:37:26.747
Oh, Lucas, you have to try some.
It's so good.

508
00:37:28.498 --> 00:37:29.666
Go ahead.

509
00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:36.423
This is awesome.

510
00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:39.092
Tastes like green-apple bubble gum.

511
00:37:45.682 --> 00:37:48.101
That went away quick.
Another round for you?

512
00:37:48.268 --> 00:37:49.770
Oh, yeah, keep it coming.

513
00:38:05.869 --> 00:38:07.955
Get it while it's hot.

514
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:13.043
Whoa, I didn't know
humans could change their colors.

515
00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:15.087
-Trippy.
-Perhaps our young pupa...

516
00:38:15.254 --> 00:38:17.673
...ate too much honeydew.

517
00:38:22.761 --> 00:38:24.388
Here, eat this.

518
00:38:24.555 --> 00:38:25.931
It'll make you feel better.

519
00:38:27.266 --> 00:38:29.434
What did that come out of?

520
00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.353
It's an alka root.

521
00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:35.566
Zoc discovered its powers to expel evil
and create well-being.

522
00:38:36.692 --> 00:38:38.777
He is a great wizard.

523
00:38:38.986 --> 00:38:40.988
Yeah, he hates me.

524
00:38:41.154 --> 00:38:42.698
Whoa, he really does, doesn't he?

525
00:38:42.865 --> 00:38:44.575
I mean, he hates your guts.

526
00:38:44.741 --> 00:38:47.452
It's actually amazing
how much he hates your guts.

527
00:38:47.619 --> 00:38:48.871
Okay, I'm sorry.

528
00:38:49.037 --> 00:38:52.875
Yes, Zoc has anger issues,
especially towards humans...

529
00:38:53.041 --> 00:38:54.501
...but he's a true ant.

530
00:38:54.918 --> 00:38:57.921
Hard on the outside,
but soft on the inside.

531
00:38:58.338 --> 00:39:00.841
Just give him time, Lucas.

532
00:39:19.151 --> 00:39:20.611
Praise the Mother.

533
00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.822
Praise the Mother.

534
00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.825
Thanks.

535
00:39:27.034 --> 00:39:29.536
Who is this mother
you keep talking about, anyway?

536
00:39:29.703 --> 00:39:30.787
Is it the queen?

537
00:39:30.954 --> 00:39:33.207
No, Lucas, the Ant Mother.

538
00:39:33.624 --> 00:39:35.209
The queen of queens.

539
00:39:35.375 --> 00:39:38.170
She gave birth to the first colony.

540
00:39:38.378 --> 00:39:41.089
To all ants.

541
00:39:41.256 --> 00:39:44.718
Come on. It's time for you to see.

542
00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:04.238
This is the Chamber of the Ages.

543
00:40:07.574 --> 00:40:09.076
What are these?

544
00:40:09.409 --> 00:40:12.955
They tell the story
of our colony, our history.

545
00:40:13.121 --> 00:40:15.415
These are pretty cool.

546
00:40:26.802 --> 00:40:30.180
This is the image of the Ant Mother.

547
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.228
It is said that one day she will return...

548
00:40:36.395 --> 00:40:40.232
...and honeydew will pour
from the sky like rain.

549
00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.777
Then we will never go hungry again.

550
00:40:43.944 --> 00:40:46.613
So you actually want warm poop
to fall from the sky?

551
00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:50.450
Yes. That would be a blessed day.

552
00:40:50.909 --> 00:40:53.745
I'm sorry, it's just so beautiful.

553
00:40:54.204 --> 00:40:56.874
Hey, what's that one?

554
00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.750
It's the evil one.

555
00:40:59.459 --> 00:41:01.378
The Cloudbreather.

556
00:41:01.753 --> 00:41:04.840
It is ancient, drawn before our time.

557
00:41:05.007 --> 00:41:10.429
No one knows for sure what it is,
except that death is said to follow it.

558
00:41:10.596 --> 00:41:13.807
I think it's just a story used
to scare naughty pupas into behaving.

559
00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:17.811
No, the exterminator.

560
00:41:17.978 --> 00:41:19.271
l-- I gotta cancel him.

561
00:41:19.479 --> 00:41:20.898
I gotta go home now.

562
00:41:21.064 --> 00:41:22.441
But you're not an ant yet.

563
00:41:22.816 --> 00:41:24.818
-Just a quick visit.
-No way, Two Legs.

564
00:41:24.985 --> 00:41:26.987
The humans' nest is strictly forbidden.

565
00:41:28.071 --> 00:41:29.489
Well...

566
00:41:30.324 --> 00:41:32.409
...the colony needs food, right?

567
00:41:32.576 --> 00:41:34.077
Food?

568
00:41:34.286 --> 00:41:37.080
Yeah, sweet rocks.
My house is filled with them.

569
00:41:37.247 --> 00:41:40.709
-In assorted colors and flavors.
-Assorted flavors?

570
00:41:40.876 --> 00:41:42.127
Even the greenies?

571
00:41:42.336 --> 00:41:44.838
Well, you'll be needing a scout.

572
00:41:45.005 --> 00:41:46.924
No. There is no way
you're gonna get me--

573
00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:49.593
-I'm in.
-Come on.

574
00:41:50.677 --> 00:41:52.971
Better be some red ones.

575
00:41:56.517 --> 00:41:58.727
Wow, this is a big nest.

576
00:41:58.894 --> 00:42:01.647
Must have taken thousands
of humans to build this.

577
00:42:01.855 --> 00:42:04.024
-What's that?
-It's just the door.

578
00:42:04.191 --> 00:42:06.693
A door? Fantastic.

579
00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:09.321
Do all of your guests
pass under this door?

580
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:13.325
Well, actually, you guys
are the first friends I've had over.

581
00:42:13.534 --> 00:42:15.244
We are the first ones?

582
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:18.163
Kreela, we're the first ones
to pass under the door.

583
00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:20.457
-Great.
-And to think...

584
00:42:20.624 --> 00:42:24.044
...all of this is made from your own poop.

585
00:42:24.378 --> 00:42:25.504
Nice.

586
00:42:26.839 --> 00:42:30.217
Oh, why did Mom
have to get shag carpet?

587
00:42:30.384 --> 00:42:33.136
lt'll take days to get to the kitchen.

588
00:42:33.303 --> 00:42:36.807
Oh, gee, that is too bad.

589
00:42:36.974 --> 00:42:40.769
I guess now we'll have to go home
before we all get in trouble.

590
00:42:43.313 --> 00:42:44.523
No.

591
00:42:45.732 --> 00:42:47.401
Wait.

592
00:42:51.613 --> 00:42:52.865
Come on.

593
00:42:53.073 --> 00:42:54.867
This is called hang-gliding.

594
00:42:56.493 --> 00:42:59.371
Have you ever done this, actually?

595
00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:00.789
I played the video game.

596
00:43:00.956 --> 00:43:03.500
Now, when I give the word,
everybody jump.

597
00:43:07.713 --> 00:43:09.214
Now.

598
00:43:12.384 --> 00:43:14.553
Oh, sorry, was that the word?

599
00:43:14.761 --> 00:43:16.889
-Coming.
-Hey, hey, look out.

600
00:43:17.097 --> 00:43:20.100
For queen and colony.

601
00:43:20.267 --> 00:43:22.352
Oh, God.

602
00:43:27.774 --> 00:43:31.987
-Showoff.
-Awesome. Yeah.

603
00:43:34.031 --> 00:43:36.200
This is Hawaii.
We went there last summer.

604
00:43:36.366 --> 00:43:39.703
It's got volcanoes and hula dancers
and Don Ho and surfboards.

605
00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:41.455
And I caught a fish.

606
00:43:42.831 --> 00:43:45.542
And these are the pyramids.
Well, not the real pyramids.

607
00:43:45.709 --> 00:43:48.545
The real ones are lots bigger.
Mommo says aliens built them.

608
00:43:48.712 --> 00:43:50.047
She's my grandma.

609
00:43:59.723 --> 00:44:01.558
Oh, are these your nest mates?

610
00:44:01.975 --> 00:44:04.436
Yeah, that's my family.

611
00:44:04.603 --> 00:44:05.729
Which one's the queen?

612
00:44:05.896 --> 00:44:08.607
My sister thinks she is.

613
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:10.943
What's wrong?

614
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:14.279
Nothing. It's just, well....

615
00:44:15.614 --> 00:44:18.617
I should have told
my mom goodbye. That's all.

616
00:44:19.284 --> 00:44:22.120
I can be a real jerk sometimes.

617
00:44:22.955 --> 00:44:25.415
-Lucas, your face is leaking.
-Leaking?

618
00:44:25.624 --> 00:44:28.460
Oh, no, it's okay.

619
00:44:28.669 --> 00:44:30.921
Is that what humans do
when they're sad?

620
00:44:31.088 --> 00:44:32.589
They leak from the face?

621
00:44:33.131 --> 00:44:36.718
When ants are sad, we do this:

622
00:44:56.530 --> 00:44:59.491
Oh, Lucas, it's-- It's--

623
00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:01.660
It's beautiful!

624
00:45:03.036 --> 00:45:05.664
Sweet rocks, come to papa!

625
00:45:23.515 --> 00:45:24.474
Red one.

626
00:45:24.683 --> 00:45:27.311
What are you doing?
Why aren't you taking the red ones?

627
00:45:27.477 --> 00:45:30.647
Well, it's actually
quite simple, sugar lips.

628
00:45:30.814 --> 00:45:32.191
I hate the red ones.

629
00:45:32.399 --> 00:45:34.484
Well, I love the red ones.

630
00:45:34.651 --> 00:45:36.153
-Hate them.
-I love them!

631
00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.030
-Hate, hate, hate.
-Love. Love.

632
00:45:38.197 --> 00:45:41.033
-Admit it, you find me attractive.
-What?

633
00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.911
Oh, how you tease me
with your sweet talk.

634
00:45:44.077 --> 00:45:46.371
Oh, you want some sweet talk?

635
00:45:46.538 --> 00:45:48.790
Because I'll give you some sweet talk.

636
00:45:48.957 --> 00:45:51.376
Now grab a red one
before I pull these off.

637
00:45:51.585 --> 00:45:53.170
Whoa, I need those.

638
00:45:55.047 --> 00:45:56.590
What are we doing?

639
00:45:56.757 --> 00:45:58.592
Nothing, nothing.

640
00:46:18.779 --> 00:46:21.573
-Mommo, I'm back!
-What was that?

641
00:46:22.449 --> 00:46:24.701
-Tiffany.
-What's a Tiffany?

642
00:46:24.868 --> 00:46:26.245
-Hurry up!
-Right.

643
00:46:26.453 --> 00:46:28.080
Leave the red ones behind!

644
00:46:28.288 --> 00:46:30.040
Fugax!

645
00:46:31.959 --> 00:46:34.253
Hey, pipsqueak, you there?

646
00:46:34.461 --> 00:46:36.213
Hello?

647
00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:38.131
<i>Crossfire!</i>

648
00:46:38.507 --> 00:46:42.469
That kid and his stupid electronic toys.

649
00:46:46.557 --> 00:46:48.058
What is he doing?

650
00:46:48.267 --> 00:46:50.561
Jumping. You know,
hippity hop, uppity downy?

651
00:46:50.727 --> 00:46:52.729
It's a scout thing.
You wouldn't understand.

652
00:46:53.105 --> 00:46:55.023
Okay, come on. One more.

653
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:56.233
I just need a seven.

654
00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:03.448
-Hello. How are you?
-Hi.

655
00:47:03.615 --> 00:47:05.534
Pizza Kingdom. Hail to the king.

656
00:47:05.701 --> 00:47:09.496
Would you like to try our new
Princess Pepperoni with tangy Jester Sauce?

657
00:47:09.872 --> 00:47:12.040
Hello! This is Lucas Nickle!

658
00:47:12.207 --> 00:47:14.334
I need to cancel my order!

659
00:47:17.254 --> 00:47:18.255
<i>What?</i>

660
00:47:18.463 --> 00:47:19.798
You don't want to order?

661
00:47:22.092 --> 00:47:24.261
Please cancel the contract!

662
00:47:24.428 --> 00:47:29.183
<i>-No exterminator!
-No extra tomato. Got it.</i>

663
00:47:31.018 --> 00:47:33.228
Yes. No exterminator.

664
00:47:33.395 --> 00:47:35.355
I'm canceling the contract.

665
00:47:35.522 --> 00:47:38.483
What? You-- You wanna cancel?

666
00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:39.610
Who is this?

667
00:47:39.818 --> 00:47:41.653
Oh, Bill, is this you, man?

668
00:47:41.862 --> 00:47:45.032
You got me, man. You got me, dude.

669
00:47:46.909 --> 00:47:48.160
That's a relief.

670
00:47:48.327 --> 00:47:51.830
Okay, Lucas, I don't understand
most of what just happened.

671
00:47:52.039 --> 00:47:53.498
What is an exterminator?

672
00:47:53.665 --> 00:47:57.544
Oh, don't worry. Everything's okay now.

673
00:48:04.968 --> 00:48:06.637
Hide!

674
00:48:09.932 --> 00:48:12.768
This is Tiff. Hi, Mom.

675
00:48:12.935 --> 00:48:16.188
Yeah, everything's fine.
Lucas is being a pest.

676
00:48:17.898 --> 00:48:19.191
He's in his room playing...

677
00:48:19.358 --> 00:48:21.068
-...those stupid video games.
-No, no!

678
00:48:21.735 --> 00:48:24.196
I will. I will. Okay, Mom.

679
00:48:24.613 --> 00:48:29.660
Yes. I'm hugging the phone too. Bye.

680
00:48:35.415 --> 00:48:37.376
You must be Queen Tiffany.

681
00:48:37.543 --> 00:48:39.086
Allow me to introduce--

682
00:48:51.723 --> 00:48:53.433
Remember your training.

683
00:48:55.853 --> 00:48:57.855
Oh, no. No, no, no! Mother!

684
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:03.610
<i>We're sorry. Your call
cannot be completed as dialed.</i>

685
00:49:03.777 --> 00:49:05.404
Hello?

686
00:49:06.405 --> 00:49:08.907
Tiffany, no! You'll squish Lucas.

687
00:49:09.074 --> 00:49:11.368
Hello. Nobody's shrunk.
Gotta go. Bye-bye.

688
00:49:11.535 --> 00:49:12.786
What are you talking about?

689
00:49:12.953 --> 00:49:15.706
Lucas! You let him go. It's me you want.

690
00:49:15.873 --> 00:49:21.628
Come back. Probe me instead. Lucas!

691
00:49:24.464 --> 00:49:27.509
Bring back Lucas, you alien scum!

692
00:49:27.676 --> 00:49:29.678
Oh, Lucas. Lucas.

693
00:49:29.845 --> 00:49:31.263
-Okay, Mommo.
-Lucas.

694
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:34.600
Let's go find your other teeth.

695
00:49:53.285 --> 00:49:56.705
Hova, where are you?

696
00:50:07.883 --> 00:50:11.929
Hova? Hova! Are you all right?

697
00:50:12.513 --> 00:50:14.848
Are we all right? Of course.
Why wouldn't we be?

698
00:50:15.015 --> 00:50:17.935
We're fine. We're all right. Silly.

699
00:50:18.769 --> 00:50:20.729
Whoa, whoa, wait.
No, wait, now, hold up.

700
00:50:20.896 --> 00:50:23.065
Zoc! Zoc, guess what we did?

701
00:50:23.232 --> 00:50:25.317
We went to Hawaii.
We saw the pyramids.

702
00:50:25.484 --> 00:50:26.902
We flew without wings.

703
00:50:27.069 --> 00:50:28.654
At first, it was like:

704
00:50:28.862 --> 00:50:30.364
But then it was:

705
00:50:30.531 --> 00:50:33.867
Of course, the others were terrified,
so I took charge. And then we....

706
00:50:34.034 --> 00:50:36.495
We were inside the humans' nest.

707
00:50:36.662 --> 00:50:39.665
Humans' nest? That's forbidden!

708
00:50:39.873 --> 00:50:40.958
Right, right.

709
00:50:41.124 --> 00:50:43.961
But the nest was filled
with sweet rocks, okay.

710
00:50:44.127 --> 00:50:45.629
Lots of them.

711
00:50:45.796 --> 00:50:49.883
But then Queen Tiffany started swatting,
some massive flying teeth attacked us...

712
00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:52.845
...and, well, here we are.
What a day. Good night.

713
00:50:53.011 --> 00:50:56.473
And who told you
about these sweet rocks?

714
00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:59.852
-Lucas, of course.
-Really?

715
00:51:02.521 --> 00:51:04.523
Hi, there. How are you?

716
00:51:06.066 --> 00:51:08.861
-Okay.
-Okay. That's good.

717
00:51:09.069 --> 00:51:10.863
It's good to be okay.

718
00:51:11.029 --> 00:51:15.701
Listen, I just wanted
to show you something, if that's okay.

719
00:51:16.785 --> 00:51:18.787
You know what this is?

720
00:51:19.079 --> 00:51:22.875
This is the potion that will
make you big again.

721
00:51:23.208 --> 00:51:27.087
I just wanted you to take
a good, long look at it.

722
00:51:27.546 --> 00:51:30.340
Because this is the last time
you will ever see it.

723
00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:33.010
What do you mean?

724
00:51:33.177 --> 00:51:37.431
I mean, there is no way I am ever
going to make you big again.

725
00:51:39.224 --> 00:51:44.146
Ever. You are a threat
to every ant in this colony.

726
00:51:44.313 --> 00:51:46.231
Especially to Hova.

727
00:51:46.398 --> 00:51:48.859
But I would never do anything
to hurt Hova.

728
00:51:49.026 --> 00:51:52.070
I just-- l--

729
00:51:52.279 --> 00:51:54.239
I just wanna go home.

730
00:51:54.406 --> 00:51:56.033
Well, then, if I were you...

731
00:51:56.200 --> 00:52:01.496
...l'd try to find help somewhere else,
because there is nothing for you here.

732
00:52:03.832 --> 00:52:05.209
Nothing.

733
00:52:17.137 --> 00:52:19.097
The pain, the pain! It's unbearable.

734
00:52:19.306 --> 00:52:20.766
Just put me out of my misery!

735
00:52:20.974 --> 00:52:22.643
Oh, hold still, you big pupa.

736
00:52:22.809 --> 00:52:25.145
I haven't even touched you yet.

737
00:52:26.313 --> 00:52:28.273
Be gentle with me.

738
00:52:37.491 --> 00:52:39.952
-Where's Lucas?
-Isn't he with you?

739
00:52:40.202 --> 00:52:45.415
-No.
-Lucas? Lucas? That's weird.

740
00:52:45.707 --> 00:52:49.169
Well, he's probably off destroying
some other poor, unfortunate colony.

741
00:52:49.336 --> 00:52:51.338
You know how they are. Destroyers.

742
00:52:52.047 --> 00:52:53.423
Zoc, what have you done?

743
00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:56.760
-Me? What did I do?
-Where is he?

744
00:52:56.927 --> 00:52:58.345
He's gone.

745
00:52:58.512 --> 00:53:01.598
-He led you into a trap, Hova.
-There was no trap.

746
00:53:01.807 --> 00:53:04.977
He led us to food.
He was trying to protect us from....

747
00:53:05.185 --> 00:53:07.604
-From what? What, Hova?
-From something.

748
00:53:07.771 --> 00:53:09.231
Oh, something!

749
00:53:09.398 --> 00:53:11.441
And I was worried it was from nothing.

750
00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:13.277
He's blinded you, Hova.

751
00:53:13.443 --> 00:53:15.696
No, you are the one who's blind.

752
00:53:15.863 --> 00:53:19.116
You are so consumed
by your hatred for the humans...

753
00:53:19.283 --> 00:53:22.494
-...you see only what you want to see.
-Oh, come on.

754
00:53:22.828 --> 00:53:26.665
Zoc, I see a young pupa,
a human learning our ways...

755
00:53:26.832 --> 00:53:30.502
...becoming part of this colony,
becoming an ant.

756
00:53:30.836 --> 00:53:33.130
-Impossible.
-Listen to yourself, Zoc.

757
00:53:33.297 --> 00:53:36.884
"A wizard knows no such word."
So, what are you now?

758
00:53:37.176 --> 00:53:39.636
Certainly not the ant I love.

759
00:53:40.012 --> 00:53:41.513
Hova!

760
00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:44.391
I did it for you, for the colony.

761
00:53:44.558 --> 00:53:46.727
You did it for yourself.

762
00:53:47.352 --> 00:53:49.062
Hova, I....

763
00:53:51.273 --> 00:53:53.150
He won't make it
through the night alone.

764
00:53:53.317 --> 00:53:55.319
Fugax, your leg's broken.

765
00:53:55.527 --> 00:53:57.863
Yeah, but I still have five good ones.

766
00:53:58.030 --> 00:53:59.948
Very good ones.

767
00:54:00.115 --> 00:54:03.660
You know, I believe he was trying
to protect us from something.

768
00:54:03.869 --> 00:54:05.871
See you, Zoc.

769
00:54:28.519 --> 00:54:30.521
Maybe Zoc is right.

770
00:54:30.812 --> 00:54:33.732
Now I'll never get home.

771
00:54:36.026 --> 00:54:38.862
Hi! Nice evening, huh?

772
00:54:39.029 --> 00:54:40.030
Oh, may I?

773
00:54:40.906 --> 00:54:42.032
Sure, help yourself.

774
00:54:42.241 --> 00:54:46.203
Thanks, I love water! I'm a beetle
that loves water, but I'm not a water beetle.

775
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:49.039
Isn't that funny? I'm a beetle--

776
00:55:26.326 --> 00:55:27.828
Hey, Lucas.

777
00:55:28.871 --> 00:55:32.374
Hey, anybody know what...means?

778
00:55:33.083 --> 00:55:35.460
I think I just figured it out.

779
00:55:36.503 --> 00:55:37.588
Croaker!

780
00:55:41.133 --> 00:55:42.426
This way!

781
00:55:49.433 --> 00:55:51.101
Don't ever leave me again.

782
00:55:51.268 --> 00:55:53.604
-But Zoc told me--
-You are my pupa, not Zoc's.

783
00:55:57.191 --> 00:55:58.692
Lucas, come on.

784
00:56:04.656 --> 00:56:08.285
Climb! You can do it. Just concentrate.

785
00:56:09.411 --> 00:56:11.163
I'm an ant. Okay, I'm an ant.

786
00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:14.416
-He's got it. He's got it.
-Look, I'm an ant!

787
00:56:14.583 --> 00:56:17.461
He hasn't got it.

788
00:56:25.177 --> 00:56:27.179
Grab hold!

789
00:56:29.014 --> 00:56:30.807
Hova?

790
00:56:32.851 --> 00:56:34.853
Lucas!

791
00:56:48.784 --> 00:56:52.079
Wow, we came right
down that guy's throat, didn't we?

792
00:56:52.246 --> 00:56:53.956
Hey, smiley, you're on my wing.

793
00:56:54.122 --> 00:56:56.083
Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

794
00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:57.709
So, what do you guys do?

795
00:56:57.876 --> 00:57:00.921
I'm a glowworm. I glow.

796
00:57:01.088 --> 00:57:02.297
That's great!

797
00:57:02.464 --> 00:57:04.967
You're really starting
to irritate me. Can you--?

798
00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:12.140
Oh, gross.

799
00:57:12.391 --> 00:57:15.143
Will you quit eating, fatso?

800
00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:17.271
It's cramped in here.
There's no more room!

801
00:57:17.437 --> 00:57:22.192
Don't worry. I'm afraid we will be
moving along in due course.

802
00:57:22.359 --> 00:57:23.986
Always with the negative with you.

803
00:57:24.152 --> 00:57:27.531
Why can't you be more-- Hey, Lenny!

804
00:57:27.906 --> 00:57:29.366
This is what I'm talking about.

805
00:57:29.533 --> 00:57:32.828
Lenny always has a smile on his face--

806
00:57:35.539 --> 00:57:37.374
Let me out! Let me out!

807
00:57:37.541 --> 00:57:40.544
-I don't wanna be a toadstool!
-"A toadstool." That's great.

808
00:57:40.752 --> 00:57:42.337
-You like that?
-That's very funny.

809
00:57:42.504 --> 00:57:44.590
There's plenty more
where that came from, pal.

810
00:57:44.756 --> 00:57:46.633
I like-- Hi, what's your name?

811
00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.886
There he goes again.

812
00:57:50.179 --> 00:57:52.264
Stop! Come back!

813
00:57:52.431 --> 00:57:53.849
-Hova!
-No!

814
00:57:54.016 --> 00:57:56.560
Hova, he's gone.

815
00:57:57.728 --> 00:57:59.938
Croaker, over here. This way!

816
00:58:00.105 --> 00:58:01.315
-Zoc!
-Zoc!

817
00:58:01.481 --> 00:58:03.650
I am delicious, eat me.

818
00:58:03.817 --> 00:58:05.944
Zoc, are you crazy?

819
00:58:06.111 --> 00:58:08.739
-He's crazy.
-Hey, froggy!

820
00:58:10.782 --> 00:58:13.744
No relationship is worth this.

821
00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:22.419
Oh, sure. Why not? Come on in.

822
00:58:22.628 --> 00:58:25.964
-Welcome to paradise.
-Zoc! How'd you get here?

823
00:58:26.131 --> 00:58:28.342
I sure didn't come in
through the rear entrance.

824
00:58:28.509 --> 00:58:31.136
Welcome. Make yourself at home. Hi.

825
00:58:31.303 --> 00:58:32.804
Who is this? Your ant?

826
00:58:32.971 --> 00:58:35.766
Zoc, you are crazy.
You're inside a frog, for Mother's sake.

827
00:58:35.933 --> 00:58:37.768
What are you doing? This is impossible!

828
00:58:37.935 --> 00:58:40.646
"Listen to yourself, Zoc.
A wizard knows no such word.

829
00:58:40.812 --> 00:58:43.106
So, what are you now?"

830
00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:46.485
Weirdo.

831
00:58:47.319 --> 00:58:49.029
What does she see in you?

832
00:58:49.196 --> 00:58:52.115
-What does she see in you?
-Exactly!

833
00:58:56.078 --> 00:58:57.663
Not me.

834
00:58:58.038 --> 00:59:01.333
-Hey, is that...?
-Alka root? So it is.

835
00:59:04.461 --> 00:59:05.671
-Oh, no.
-Oh, my.

836
00:59:09.091 --> 00:59:11.009
You might wanna let go of that.

837
00:59:11.176 --> 00:59:14.054
Oh, no. So you can grab it?
I don't think so.

838
00:59:14.221 --> 00:59:17.182
-Hands in the air.
-Oh, my.

839
00:59:22.229 --> 00:59:24.022
Wow, that was great!

840
00:59:24.189 --> 00:59:27.025
Hey, we sure owe you one!
Thanks a lot!

841
00:59:27.442 --> 00:59:30.696
I'm free! I'm free!

842
00:59:31.989 --> 00:59:34.491
Oh, crap.

843
00:59:37.327 --> 00:59:40.622
Hey, Zoc, thanks. But why'd you do it?

844
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:44.209
An ant will sacrifice himself
for his friends.

845
00:59:44.376 --> 00:59:47.671
-I thought you hated me.
-I didn't do it for you.

846
01:00:02.895 --> 01:00:05.230
All right, well, we should
camp here for the night.

847
01:00:05.397 --> 01:00:07.983
Come on, Fugax. Let's forage some food.

848
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:11.069
Excuse me? I don't forage.

849
01:00:11.236 --> 01:00:13.655
I'll scout for food.

850
01:00:13.822 --> 01:00:15.282
Right, let's go.

851
01:00:15.616 --> 01:00:17.534
Zoc, stay with Lucas.

852
01:00:17.701 --> 01:00:19.244
He's been through a lot today.

853
01:00:19.411 --> 01:00:22.331
-Hova, please, don't ask me to--
-He's not what you think.

854
01:00:22.497 --> 01:00:24.333
There is goodness in him.

855
01:00:24.499 --> 01:00:27.252
There's an ant in him.

856
01:00:27.753 --> 01:00:30.506
See, he really is trying.

857
01:00:30.672 --> 01:00:32.382
Come on. You can do it.

858
01:00:32.633 --> 01:00:36.803
-Concentrate.
-One, two, three.

859
01:00:37.012 --> 01:00:41.225
Think ant. Ant. Ant.

860
01:00:42.392 --> 01:00:44.603
Yeah, all right.

861
01:00:46.271 --> 01:00:48.106
Craznocks.

862
01:00:57.407 --> 01:00:58.700
It's funny.

863
01:00:58.867 --> 01:01:02.162
The sky looks exactly the same.

864
01:01:02.329 --> 01:01:04.748
Everything else is so different...

865
01:01:04.915 --> 01:01:08.126
...but it's the same sky, the same stars.

866
01:01:10.629 --> 01:01:12.464
Why must you keep doing that?

867
01:01:12.631 --> 01:01:17.094
-Are you ill?
-What? Oh, you mean yawning.

868
01:01:17.261 --> 01:01:20.597
-I'm just tired.
-Please stop. It's disgusting.

869
01:01:20.848 --> 01:01:25.894
-Ants don't yawn?
-Definitely not, thank you.

870
01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:32.317
So this city of yours, it's like a nest?

871
01:01:32.484 --> 01:01:35.195
Well, yeah. Kind of.

872
01:01:35.362 --> 01:01:38.073
And the humans that live there
are all brothers...

873
01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:41.201
...working together
for the greatness of their colony?

874
01:01:41.577 --> 01:01:43.662
Well, not exactly.

875
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:48.709
It's a little more like,
you know, every man for himself.

876
01:01:49.001 --> 01:01:51.336
But that's so primitive.

877
01:01:51.503 --> 01:01:53.046
How does anything get done?

878
01:01:53.338 --> 01:01:55.174
Some people work together.

879
01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:57.217
Some. Why not all?

880
01:01:57.718 --> 01:02:00.888
I suppose it's because
of their differences.

881
01:02:01.054 --> 01:02:03.640
But it's the differences
that make a colony strong.

882
01:02:03.849 --> 01:02:07.519
Foragers, scouts, drones,
nurses, regurgitators...

883
01:02:07.686 --> 01:02:10.939
...all are different,
but an essential part of the whole.

884
01:02:11.106 --> 01:02:13.567
This is where we ants draw our strength.

885
01:02:14.902 --> 01:02:16.987
My differences just get me beat up.

886
01:02:17.196 --> 01:02:19.865
-And why is that?
-I don't know.

887
01:02:20.365 --> 01:02:23.869
Some humans prefer to clobber people
they don't understand.

888
01:02:24.036 --> 01:02:27.789
Like you prefer to clobber ants.

889
01:02:28.624 --> 01:02:31.793
I guess I didn't think
about what I was doing.

890
01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:34.379
Seems to happen a lot.

891
01:02:37.132 --> 01:02:41.178
I suppose sometimes I, too,
can act without thinking.

892
01:02:43.013 --> 01:02:47.226
Perhaps in this way, we are alike.

893
01:02:50.229 --> 01:02:52.523
Good night, Lucas.

894
01:02:52.689 --> 01:02:54.358
Good night, Zoc.

895
01:03:34.815 --> 01:03:36.775
-What's the matter?
-Look!

896
01:03:36.942 --> 01:03:38.986
-What is it? What's wrong?
-I see her!

897
01:03:39.152 --> 01:03:40.946
-Who her?
-The Ant Mother!

898
01:03:41.113 --> 01:03:43.407
She's come! She's here!

899
01:03:45.951 --> 01:03:48.453
Look! Look!

900
01:03:53.208 --> 01:03:54.751
What do you know?

901
01:03:55.544 --> 01:03:57.337
There really is an--

902
01:04:00.299 --> 01:04:01.633
No.

903
01:04:11.518 --> 01:04:13.312
Cloudbreather.

904
01:04:13.478 --> 01:04:16.064
But I cancelled the contract.

905
01:04:17.441 --> 01:04:19.193
Praise the Mother!

906
01:04:19.359 --> 01:04:21.195
-Praise the Mother!
-She's come at last!

907
01:04:21.486 --> 01:04:24.948
Everyone, please, calm down.

908
01:04:29.328 --> 01:04:32.706
Listen to me! It is not the Ant Mother!

909
01:04:32.873 --> 01:04:36.168
-It is a Cloudbreather!
-It's true.

910
01:04:36.793 --> 01:04:39.171
He's come to wipe out the entire colony.

911
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:41.215
How can we possibly fight back?

912
01:04:41.632 --> 01:04:43.133
His magic is strong.

913
01:04:45.677 --> 01:04:47.137
Sprayers.

914
01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:50.349
Foggers.

915
01:04:50.891 --> 01:04:52.351
Oh, that's the stuff.

916
01:04:52.518 --> 01:04:54.228
Zappers.

917
01:04:55.312 --> 01:04:56.647
Sulfur bombs.

918
01:05:03.362 --> 01:05:06.990
And how do you know of this creature?

919
01:05:07.366 --> 01:05:09.284
Because....

920
01:05:10.202 --> 01:05:12.663
-Because I brought him here.
-Lucas!

921
01:05:12.871 --> 01:05:13.997
I knew it. I told you.

922
01:05:14.206 --> 01:05:17.960
-Guards, remove this human.
-Come on, kid.

923
01:05:18.126 --> 01:05:20.379
-Hova!
-Lucas!

924
01:05:22.256 --> 01:05:24.883
-No.
-Wait. The potion.

925
01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:30.514
That's it! Zoc, you shrunk me.
You can shrink the Cloudbreather.

926
01:05:31.181 --> 01:05:33.934
We can load these things up and then:

927
01:05:34.101 --> 01:05:35.561
Right in the ear!

928
01:05:36.728 --> 01:05:39.189
Yes. Yes, perhaps.

929
01:05:39.356 --> 01:05:42.150
But the Cloudbreather
towers above us like a tree.

930
01:05:42.317 --> 01:05:43.902
How do we get close enough?

931
01:05:44.069 --> 01:05:45.612
I've got an idea.

932
01:05:45.779 --> 01:05:50.701
Zoc, you would trust this human?

933
01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:01.920
Yoo-hoo, hello?

934
01:06:02.087 --> 01:06:04.047
We need to talk to you.

935
01:06:04.923 --> 01:06:07.176
Show yourselves.

936
01:06:08.093 --> 01:06:11.430
Down here. Hello?

937
01:06:18.604 --> 01:06:22.941
Well, well, well.
Just in time for lunch.

938
01:06:23.108 --> 01:06:24.818
-Hello.
-Wait.

939
01:06:24.985 --> 01:06:27.571
Listen to me. We come in peace.

940
01:06:27.779 --> 01:06:31.950
The exterminator's here. He brings
death clouds that will destroy us all...

941
01:06:32.117 --> 01:06:34.411
...unless we can work together
to stop him.

942
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:37.372
Death clouds, huh?

943
01:06:37.539 --> 01:06:40.083
Okay, let's eat.

944
01:06:42.169 --> 01:06:43.629
Get behind me.

945
01:06:56.225 --> 01:07:01.647
Sir, the east nest, totally destroyed.

946
01:07:02.064 --> 01:07:04.316
The cloud is coming.

947
01:07:04.691 --> 01:07:07.569
The cloud!

948
01:07:19.873 --> 01:07:23.168
What do you have in mind?

949
01:07:29.049 --> 01:07:32.135
Remember, you only get one shot at it.

950
01:07:32.344 --> 01:07:36.557
Don't fire until you see
the wax of his ears.

951
01:07:36.723 --> 01:07:39.351
-Understood.
-Ready? Lucas?

952
01:07:39.518 --> 01:07:42.896
-Good to go.
-Hey. Hey. Stop it. Stop it.

953
01:07:43.063 --> 01:07:46.567
Zoc! Can I switch? Mine's broken.

954
01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:49.486
All right, boys. Heat them up.

955
01:07:55.117 --> 01:07:57.744
Let's fly.

956
01:08:17.097 --> 01:08:20.434
Hey, that looks fun. Let's help, shall we?

957
01:08:20.601 --> 01:08:24.271
Okay. I only live two weeks anyway.

958
01:08:24.438 --> 01:08:26.732
Good for you.

959
01:08:35.282 --> 01:08:38.452
First wave, attack!

960
01:08:43.707 --> 01:08:47.085
So you want to rumble, huh?
Come on. Come on.

961
01:08:47.252 --> 01:08:48.754
Come on!

962
01:08:48.921 --> 01:08:50.422
I'm going in.

963
01:09:00.098 --> 01:09:03.435
I can't get through.
He's got some kind of shield.

964
01:09:03.852 --> 01:09:06.104
Craznocks. Headphones!

965
01:09:29.503 --> 01:09:32.673
For queen and colony!

966
01:09:34.883 --> 01:09:36.134
Yeah.

967
01:09:38.011 --> 01:09:40.264
Why have you stopped?

968
01:09:40.848 --> 01:09:44.935
Oh, geez. Boy, that hurts. Please stop.

969
01:09:45.102 --> 01:09:46.603
Bye-bye.

970
01:09:53.819 --> 01:09:57.489
We'll have to land on him.
Find a way in.

971
01:10:01.869 --> 01:10:05.205
He's reloading! Now's our chance.

972
01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.837
Draw!

973
01:10:15.174 --> 01:10:16.925
Zoc!

974
01:10:27.352 --> 01:10:30.689
-Welcome to the scalp.
-Hello.

975
01:10:30.856 --> 01:10:33.192
-Have a slice.
-Enjoy.

976
01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.820
Fingers!

977
01:10:37.029 --> 01:10:39.114
He's scratching again!

978
01:10:39.573 --> 01:10:42.659
-To the armpit!
-Dive, dive!

979
01:10:49.458 --> 01:10:52.377
Leave my friends alone!

980
01:10:58.634 --> 01:11:00.677
Don't pick your nose.
Don't pick your nose.

981
01:11:06.558 --> 01:11:09.436
-Need a lift?
-Thanks.

982
01:11:28.247 --> 01:11:30.207
No.

983
01:11:31.166 --> 01:11:34.336
Hova, are you okay?

984
01:11:34.503 --> 01:11:36.046
What?

985
01:11:37.714 --> 01:11:39.466
Nighty night.

986
01:11:40.509 --> 01:11:41.760
Run!

987
01:11:45.973 --> 01:11:49.268
Come on, get up!
We got to go, we got to go!

988
01:11:49.476 --> 01:11:51.103
I'm done, little ant.

989
01:11:57.442 --> 01:12:00.112
Run! Run!

990
01:12:01.947 --> 01:12:04.241
Lucas, go on.

991
01:12:04.408 --> 01:12:06.493
Save yourself.

992
01:12:19.965 --> 01:12:22.926
That's not the way ants are.

993
01:12:26.138 --> 01:12:27.598
Hurry up.

994
01:12:42.988 --> 01:12:45.115
Lucas? Lucas!

995
01:12:49.036 --> 01:12:50.746
Lucas!

996
01:12:56.835 --> 01:12:58.837
You did it. You did it!

997
01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.090
Now, that's an ant.

998
01:13:02.257 --> 01:13:03.509
Oh, sorry.

999
01:13:03.967 --> 01:13:06.220
Thanks, kid.

1000
01:13:15.687 --> 01:13:17.648
Oh, yeah!

1001
01:13:18.524 --> 01:13:21.735
-Our weapons are useless.
-We just need a clear shot.

1002
01:13:25.405 --> 01:13:28.367
Hey, wait. A shot.

1003
01:13:30.577 --> 01:13:33.580
Okay, now what?

1004
01:13:33.747 --> 01:13:37.751
Well, I don't know,
because I've never attacked before.

1005
01:13:37.918 --> 01:13:40.003
-Isn't that funny?
-Hilarious.

1006
01:13:40.379 --> 01:13:43.006
Oh, look. Here's a way in.

1007
01:13:46.009 --> 01:13:49.888
<i>Enjoy a world that's entirely bug free</i>

1008
01:13:50.597 --> 01:13:54.434
<i>Call Beals-A-Bug
And leave the bug-killing to me</i>

1009
01:14:00.274 --> 01:14:04.778
Okay, I'm feeling like we ought to attack
something in here.

1010
01:14:05.779 --> 01:14:08.490
Hey, that looks vulnerable.

1011
01:14:08.657 --> 01:14:11.076
Perfect.

1012
01:14:15.414 --> 01:14:18.250
Oh, look. Here's our way out.

1013
01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:21.461
Let's give this human a goodbye kiss.

1014
01:14:24.089 --> 01:14:25.883
Pucker up, Mr. Beals!

1015
01:14:51.658 --> 01:14:54.244
No, no, no.

1016
01:14:54.453 --> 01:14:56.830
Stop. Just get away from me.
Get away from me.

1017
01:15:04.296 --> 01:15:05.881
You can't exterminate me.

1018
01:15:06.048 --> 01:15:09.510
Oh, yeah. I'm Stan Beals!

1019
01:15:09.676 --> 01:15:11.428
Oh, no, no, no!

1020
01:15:13.472 --> 01:15:16.141
Praise the Mother!

1021
01:15:22.523 --> 01:15:25.025
Lucas! Lucas! Lucas!

1022
01:15:33.116 --> 01:15:38.121
This day I no longer see
a human among ants...

1023
01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:42.292
...but instead a single colony.

1024
01:15:42.459 --> 01:15:45.420
No more Lucas the Destroyer...

1025
01:15:45.587 --> 01:15:48.966
...but Rokai the ant.

1026
01:15:52.302 --> 01:15:54.680
Welcome to the colony.

1027
01:15:56.014 --> 01:15:59.101
Isn't that wonderful?

1028
01:15:59.977 --> 01:16:02.271
-Rokai?
-It's an ant name.

1029
01:16:02.437 --> 01:16:03.856
A wizard name.

1030
01:16:04.356 --> 01:16:08.694
Rokai has earned his freedom.

1031
01:16:09.194 --> 01:16:12.406
And we have earned a friend.

1032
01:16:12.823 --> 01:16:15.742
Remember us.

1033
01:16:18.996 --> 01:16:20.205
Hey, Lucas--

1034
01:16:21.206 --> 01:16:24.501
I mean, Rokai.
Listen, once you get back...

1035
01:16:24.668 --> 01:16:28.380
...if you get the chance, how about
dropping a few sweet rocks now and then?

1036
01:16:28.547 --> 01:16:31.675
You know, red ones, preferably.

1037
01:16:31.884 --> 01:16:35.095
Red ones?
I thought you hated the red ones.

1038
01:16:35.262 --> 01:16:40.058
Well, I do, but I'm starting to like them.

1039
01:16:41.143 --> 01:16:44.021
I'm gonna miss you, Two Legs.

1040
01:16:44.188 --> 01:16:46.982
Calling a human "friend."

1041
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:49.860
I thought that impossible until you came.

1042
01:16:50.027 --> 01:16:52.779
But, Zoc, a wizard knows no such word.

1043
01:16:53.447 --> 01:16:55.199
Very true.

1044
01:16:55.616 --> 01:16:56.992
Here.

1045
01:16:58.076 --> 01:17:01.163
But just wait until you're outside
before you drink it.

1046
01:17:01.330 --> 01:17:04.249
I still think I should have eaten you
when I had the chance.

1047
01:17:04.416 --> 01:17:06.210
I am soft and chewy.

1048
01:17:06.376 --> 01:17:09.254
But I promised the queen I wouldn't.

1049
01:17:09.922 --> 01:17:11.423
I'm gonna miss you, Hova.

1050
01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:14.218
We're going to miss you too, Rokai.

1051
01:17:14.384 --> 01:17:15.886
Cross our hearts.

1052
01:17:16.261 --> 01:17:18.889
Cross our hearts!

1053
01:17:28.607 --> 01:17:31.735
He's back. He's back!

1054
01:17:31.902 --> 01:17:38.075
He's in his birthday suit.
Happy birthday, Lucas!

1055
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:41.662
Got you that time.

1056
01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:52.339
Hi, Tiff. Is everything all right?

1057
01:17:52.506 --> 01:17:53.757
Where's Lucas?

1058
01:17:53.924 --> 01:17:57.427
Still locked in his room,
hiding from society.

1059
01:17:57.761 --> 01:17:59.471
Mom, hey, Mom!

1060
01:17:59.638 --> 01:18:03.267
-Lucas, what is it?
-I forgot to tell you goodbye.

1061
01:18:03.809 --> 01:18:05.769
Goodbye.

1062
01:18:05.936 --> 01:18:09.439
Goodbye, Peanut. Oh, sorry,
I shouldn't call you that.

1063
01:18:09.606 --> 01:18:12.276
It's okay. I don't mind.

1064
01:18:12.734 --> 01:18:15.529
<i>Casa, sweet casa.</i>

1065
01:18:15.821 --> 01:18:18.574
<i>These suitcases are muy grande,
my little love nacho.</i>

1066
01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:20.200
<i>How about getting the el door-o?</i>

1067
01:18:20.367 --> 01:18:22.661
I don't know what you mean, honey.

1068
01:18:22.828 --> 01:18:25.372
<i>-Yeah, honey, the puerta, the--
-What's the puerta?</i>

1069
01:18:25.539 --> 01:18:28.834
-The door, the door!
-The door. Okay, I got it. I got it.

1070
01:18:30.878 --> 01:18:34.548
Hey, Pukas, where you been?
We've been looking for you.

1071
01:18:34.715 --> 01:18:40.179
-I think someone's overdue for a dogpile.
-Yeah, dogpile!

1072
01:18:40.345 --> 01:18:41.555
He said dogpile.

1073
01:18:41.722 --> 01:18:46.226
Stop saying everything I say, got it?

1074
01:18:46.393 --> 01:18:50.355
Stop saying everything you say. Got it.

1075
01:18:50.522 --> 01:18:53.192
That's it. How about I dogpile you?

1076
01:18:53.358 --> 01:18:56.486
How about you leave him alone?
What the craznocks is wrong with you?

1077
01:18:56.987 --> 01:19:00.282
What? How about you make me?

1078
01:19:00.449 --> 01:19:04.953
Oh, that's right, you can't.

1079
01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:09.208
Because I'm big and you're small.

1080
01:19:09.541 --> 01:19:15.172
Yeah, I'm small. We're all small.
But together, we're big.

1081
01:19:15.339 --> 01:19:18.717
You think these stupid losers
are going to team up against me?

1082
01:19:18.884 --> 01:19:23.430
I can do anything I want to them,
and there's nothing they can do about it.

1083
01:19:23.764 --> 01:19:27.559
And the same goes for you, Pukas.

1084
01:19:28.143 --> 01:19:30.103
Dogpile!

1085
01:19:31.939 --> 01:19:35.901
I said, dogpile!

1086
01:19:36.735 --> 01:19:41.281
-You heard the man.
-Dogpile!

1087
01:19:43.534 --> 01:19:47.621
No! Don't hurt me! Mommy!

1088
01:19:48.664 --> 01:19:50.749
Hey, you guys want to come over
and play?

1089
01:19:50.916 --> 01:19:53.252
Yeah, cool. Come on, Lucas.

1090
01:19:53.418 --> 01:19:56.171
I'll catch up.
There's something I gotta do first.

1091
01:19:56.338 --> 01:19:59.174
Yeah! All right!

1092
01:19:59.341 --> 01:20:00.884
Oh, yeah.

1093
01:20:02.344 --> 01:20:05.055
They sure grow up fast.

1094
01:20:06.181 --> 01:20:08.225
-What?
-Look what I got.

1095
01:20:08.392 --> 01:20:09.643
Oh, no. Zoc.

1096
01:20:09.810 --> 01:20:13.814
Zoc! Wait! Wait! No, no! Stop!

1097
01:20:14.022 --> 01:20:15.566
Come on.

1098
01:20:16.441 --> 01:20:19.236
Stop it! I'm serious....

1099
01:20:24.283 --> 01:20:26.493
Sweet Rocks !!!
