00:00:25.916 --> 00:00:29.916
Well, it all started with
the great Professor Östergaard

3
00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.515
and his discovery
of the paraverse

4
00:00:32.548 --> 00:00:33.949
as we now know it.

5
00:00:33.983 --> 00:00:35.883
The exploration
into the capability

6
00:00:35.916 --> 00:00:37.581
of the human mind
is not a new one.

7
00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:49.849
We discovered that the paraverse
was much like our own world,

8
00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:53.581
except that it had been
at war for many years.

9
00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:55.783
This gave us
the perfect environment

10
00:00:55.816 --> 00:00:58.883
in which to carry out
what had previously only been

11
00:00:58.916 --> 00:01:00.683
hypothetical theory.

12
00:01:00.716 --> 00:01:04.716
CIA were working
on MK-Ultra from the 1950s,

13
00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:07.248
and the Russians had
their studies on psychokinesis

14
00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:08.381
in the same period.

15
00:01:15.548 --> 00:01:19.749
In more recent times,
the U.S. Navy had detachment G,

16
00:01:19.783 --> 00:01:22.916
and we here at Wytness
have been working in the field

17
00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:24.749
for, oh,

18
00:01:24.783 --> 00:01:25.983
nearly 25 years.

19
00:01:31.816 --> 00:01:33.481
Don't move!

20
00:01:35.348 --> 00:01:36.515
It is only now, however,

21
00:01:36.548 --> 00:01:40.649
that we are able to see
behind the curtain.

22
00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:44.849
We've bridged the void
between the worlds.

23
00:01:44.883 --> 00:01:47.716
And through rigorous testing
and endless observation,

24
00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:51.649
we are on the cusp
of propelling human evolution

25
00:01:51.683 --> 00:01:53.849
to a staggering new dimension.

26
00:05:06.382 --> 00:05:07.948
Help!

27
00:05:09.416 --> 00:05:10.281
Help!

28
00:05:20.348 --> 00:05:23.416
...is Professor Östergaard,

29
00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.716
head of Quantum science
research facility here at...

30
00:05:43.416 --> 00:05:45.516
What's happening?

31
00:06:17.783 --> 00:06:21.382
I think you'll be
pretty delighted to discover...

32
00:06:39.882 --> 00:06:40.915
I don't like it.

33
00:06:40.948 --> 00:06:42.382
What should we do?

34
00:06:42.416 --> 00:06:44.582
Uh, I think we should reset.

35
00:06:44.616 --> 00:06:46.248
Let's just see how it plays out.

36
00:06:46.282 --> 00:06:48.315
No, no, something's not right...

37
00:07:48.649 --> 00:07:49.848
Where is everyone?

38
00:07:53.948 --> 00:07:57.315
I need to get out of here.

39
00:07:57.349 --> 00:08:00.748
Okay, they got me in here,

40
00:08:00.782 --> 00:08:03.482
so there's gotta be a way out.

41
00:08:32.582 --> 00:08:34.649
There's gotta be a way out.

42
00:08:39.015 --> 00:08:40.948
There's gotta be a way out.

43
00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:46.482
There's gotta...

44
00:08:53.715 --> 00:08:56.215
I think you'll be
pretty delighted to discover

45
00:08:56.249 --> 00:08:57.915
how far we've come
in our important work

46
00:08:57.948 --> 00:09:02.882
of developing the human mind
to see infinite possibilities.

47
00:09:55.249 --> 00:09:57.249
What is this place?

48
00:12:39.016 --> 00:12:40.715
Fuck!

49
00:14:26.515 --> 00:14:29.215
We needed the subject
to feel threatened

50
00:14:29.249 --> 00:14:30.715
and in real jeopardy.

51
00:14:33.481 --> 00:14:35.448
But it wasn't until
we had developed

52
00:14:35.481 --> 00:14:36.715
the Kairos generator

53
00:14:36.748 --> 00:14:39.381
that we were able to
control the experiment.

54
00:14:43.648 --> 00:14:47.215
We needed a constant,
and that had to be time.

55
00:16:04.548 --> 00:16:06.548
- What do you think?
- The subject's unstable.

56
00:16:06.581 --> 00:16:07.883
We need to request a reset.

57
00:16:07.916 --> 00:16:10.381
I'm really not sure
we should carry on...

58
00:16:10.415 --> 00:16:11.548
Wait, is she...

59
00:16:11.581 --> 00:16:13.581
We need to reset right now!

60
00:17:13.448 --> 00:17:15.314
Where the fuck am I?

61
00:17:37.415 --> 00:17:38.649
Wait.

62
00:19:12.949 --> 00:19:14.716
Let's try this one.

63
00:19:17.481 --> 00:19:19.816
Come on, there's an entrance
on the other side.

64
00:19:50.415 --> 00:19:52.983
- Anything?
- No, the place looks dead.

65
00:19:53.015 --> 00:19:54.381
Why are we even here?

66
00:19:54.415 --> 00:19:55.783
She could be miles away by now.

67
00:19:55.816 --> 00:19:58.549
Right, let's move
to the next sector.

68
00:19:58.582 --> 00:20:01.883
Base this is Unit 7,
we're moving on.

69
00:21:17.248 --> 00:21:19.816
The many worlds interpretation

70
00:21:19.849 --> 00:21:22.982
states that
the universal wave-function

71
00:21:23.015 --> 00:21:26.649
is objectively real...

72
00:21:50.516 --> 00:21:53.449
Yes!

73
00:22:56.783 --> 00:22:58.915
Right.

74
00:22:58.948 --> 00:23:00.915
If I was a key,

75
00:23:00.948 --> 00:23:03.482
where would I be?

76
00:23:11.848 --> 00:23:13.815
There's nothing here.

77
00:23:51.616 --> 00:23:53.349
How?

78
00:24:11.683 --> 00:24:12.516
Come on.

79
00:24:18.449 --> 00:24:20.716
Come on!

80
00:24:20.748 --> 00:24:21.848
Ugh!

81
00:24:21.882 --> 00:24:24.516
Fuck!

82
00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:20.516
Hello?

83
00:25:51.648 --> 00:25:52.915
Wait!

84
00:26:05.349 --> 00:26:06.616
Hello?

85
00:26:35.648 --> 00:26:37.516
Car doesn't start.

86
00:26:39.282 --> 00:26:40.782
How do I know that?

87
00:26:52.582 --> 00:26:54.848
So weird.

88
00:26:54.882 --> 00:26:56.249
I knew it.

89
00:27:10.516 --> 00:27:13.516
Wytness Research Centre

90
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:17.782
Beacon Hall, 377891.

91
00:27:19.915 --> 00:27:21.748
North Sector.

92
00:27:32.715 --> 00:27:33.682
Hello?

93
00:28:07.615 --> 00:28:10.382
The many worlds interpretation

94
00:28:10.416 --> 00:28:13.515
states that
the universal wave-function

95
00:28:13.548 --> 00:28:15.715
is objectively real....

96
00:29:13.615 --> 00:29:14.715
Hello?

97
00:29:58.249 --> 00:29:59.682
Someone there?

98
00:31:18.249 --> 00:31:19.282
Yes!

99
00:32:04.615 --> 00:32:06.648
Come on!

100
00:32:06.682 --> 00:32:09.581
Ugh, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

101
00:32:09.615 --> 00:32:11.648
Ugh, shit!

102
00:32:37.715 --> 00:32:41.348
My name is Professor
Aaron Östergaard,

103
00:32:41.381 --> 00:32:44.448
I'm head of Quantum
science and research

104
00:32:44.481 --> 00:32:47.949
here at Wytness.

105
00:32:47.983 --> 00:32:49.381
Wytness.

106
00:32:55.381 --> 00:32:57.682
Wytness Research Centre.

107
00:33:39.016 --> 00:33:40.749
This isn't right.

108
00:34:51.348 --> 00:34:53.481
Hm.

109
00:35:00.415 --> 00:35:02.214
What?

110
00:35:37.716 --> 00:35:39.248
Picked up movement!

111
00:35:39.281 --> 00:35:40.214
Go!

112
00:35:47.883 --> 00:35:49.549
There, on the other side.

113
00:35:49.582 --> 00:35:50.616
Go!

114
00:36:14.683 --> 00:36:16.683
They've got a scent.

115
00:36:16.716 --> 00:36:18.481
Spread out.

116
00:36:22.016 --> 00:36:23.248
Listen.

117
00:36:25.849 --> 00:36:27.348
She's in there.

118
00:37:12.849 --> 00:37:15.348
Hm.

119
00:37:20.482 --> 00:37:24.649
Ah, ah, ah.

120
00:37:49.883 --> 00:37:51.248
Come on.

121
00:37:57.783 --> 00:37:59.482
Yes!

122
00:39:01.015 --> 00:39:02.248
Hello?

123
00:39:08.716 --> 00:39:10.214
Hello?

124
00:39:10.248 --> 00:39:12.549
Please, can you hear me?

125
00:39:15.482 --> 00:39:17.915
Hello, can you hear me?

126
00:39:17.948 --> 00:39:19.848
Hello, can you hear me?

127
00:39:19.882 --> 00:39:22.582
Yes! Yes!

128
00:39:22.616 --> 00:39:25.882
Oh, thank God.

129
00:39:25.915 --> 00:39:28.382
Oh, thank God.

130
00:39:28.416 --> 00:39:29.848
Where are you?

131
00:39:29.882 --> 00:39:30.915
Tell me where you are,

132
00:39:30.948 --> 00:39:32.482
and I'll come and find you.

133
00:39:32.516 --> 00:39:33.783
Look, I don't know where I am.

134
00:39:33.816 --> 00:39:34.982
I'm lost, and...

135
00:39:35.015 --> 00:39:37.248
No, no, no, you must be close
'cause I can hear you.

136
00:39:37.281 --> 00:39:38.882
Just tell me where you are.

137
00:39:38.915 --> 00:39:40.349
They're here.

138
00:39:42.848 --> 00:39:45.416
Who is?

139
00:39:45.449 --> 00:39:47.281
Who are they? What do they want?

140
00:39:47.315 --> 00:39:50.482
I don't know, look,
I can't, I've got to go.

141
00:39:53.282 --> 00:39:54.382
I can't, I can't hear you.

142
00:39:54.416 --> 00:39:55.848
Look, tell me where you are.

143
00:40:00.616 --> 00:40:02.315
Please, hello,
are you still there?

144
00:40:07.516 --> 00:40:10.449
Please, please,

145
00:40:10.482 --> 00:40:11.716
please don't go.

146
00:40:16.982 --> 00:40:18.616
Fuck!

147
00:40:46.782 --> 00:40:50.782
Okay, so if I was coming down...

148
00:40:50.815 --> 00:40:52.516
there,

149
00:40:52.549 --> 00:40:53.848
left?

150
00:41:23.482 --> 00:41:24.782
What the fuck?

151
00:41:51.782 --> 00:41:53.315
Fuck!

152
00:41:56.282 --> 00:41:59.582
Repetition of the same day
allows us our constant

153
00:41:59.616 --> 00:42:01.915
when everything else
is variable.

154
00:42:01.948 --> 00:42:04.349
Being able to reset the subjects

155
00:42:04.382 --> 00:42:07.649
when their key psychological
indicators overload

156
00:42:07.682 --> 00:42:10.249
has enabled us to
track the development

157
00:42:10.282 --> 00:42:12.616
of the subject's abilities

158
00:42:12.649 --> 00:42:14.349
and to see how close they are

159
00:42:14.382 --> 00:42:17.748
to pre-seeing possibilities

160
00:42:17.782 --> 00:42:20.616
and eventually controlling

161
00:42:20.649 --> 00:42:23.782
reality itself.

162
00:43:04.882 --> 00:43:06.349
Ugh!

163
00:43:06.382 --> 00:43:08.249
Come on!

164
00:43:12.682 --> 00:43:13.682
Of course.

165
00:43:27.315 --> 00:43:28.948
Okay.

166
00:46:01.548 --> 00:46:04.249
Hello? Is there anyone there?

167
00:46:09.315 --> 00:46:10.949
Hello?

168
00:46:44.515 --> 00:46:46.349
Hello?

169
00:46:46.382 --> 00:46:48.515
Hello? Can you hear me?

170
00:46:48.548 --> 00:46:50.648
Yes, hello, I can hear you.

171
00:46:52.916 --> 00:46:55.916
Hello, are you still there?

172
00:46:55.949 --> 00:46:58.349
I'm here...

173
00:46:58.381 --> 00:47:00.249
Can barely hear you.

174
00:47:00.282 --> 00:47:02.282
I'm so glad you're okay.

175
00:47:02.315 --> 00:47:03.615
What happened before?

176
00:47:03.648 --> 00:47:05.381
Where did you go?

177
00:47:05.415 --> 00:47:07.515
Was someone chasing you?

178
00:47:07.548 --> 00:47:10.215
There were soldiers everywhere.

179
00:47:10.249 --> 00:47:12.581
They're trying
to take me back.

180
00:47:12.615 --> 00:47:15.748
Yes, the soldiers,
I... I can hear them at night,

181
00:47:15.782 --> 00:47:16.916
I see their lights.

182
00:47:16.949 --> 00:47:19.748
I haven't seen them.

183
00:47:19.782 --> 00:47:21.315
I haven't seen anyone.

184
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:22.215
Come at night.

185
00:47:22.249 --> 00:47:25.315
Just keep moving,
okay, don't stop.

186
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:27.849
I'm trying to get
to this place,

187
00:47:27.883 --> 00:47:30.515
it's, um, a research center.

188
00:47:30.548 --> 00:47:34.282
I... I don't know why,
but I think it might help.

189
00:47:34.315 --> 00:47:35.949
Wytness...

190
00:47:35.983 --> 00:47:37.215
...all started...

191
00:47:37.249 --> 00:47:38.682
Wait, did you just say Wytness?

192
00:47:38.715 --> 00:47:40.315
That's it, that's the place!

193
00:47:42.682 --> 00:47:45.282
Hello, are you still there?

194
00:47:48.648 --> 00:47:53.348
Look, if you can hear me,
meet me at Wytness.

195
00:47:56.581 --> 00:47:58.515
Hello?

196
00:49:30.682 --> 00:49:32.381
Tracks go this way.

197
00:49:32.415 --> 00:49:34.448
Yeah, they're fresh.

198
00:49:34.481 --> 00:49:36.215
She can't have gone far.

199
00:49:36.248 --> 00:49:37.949
What do we do when we find her?

200
00:49:37.983 --> 00:49:39.648
- Reset again?
- No,

201
00:49:39.682 --> 00:49:41.949
they said to drive her forwards,
see what she does.

202
00:49:41.983 --> 00:49:43.548
They're really pushing this one.

203
00:49:43.581 --> 00:49:44.849
Why the hurry?

204
00:49:44.883 --> 00:49:45.749
How should I know?

205
00:49:47.615 --> 00:49:48.581
Go!

206
00:49:51.448 --> 00:49:52.916
Move, move, move!

207
00:51:44.783 --> 00:51:46.616
I'm still here.

208
00:51:48.248 --> 00:51:50.481
I didn't go back.

209
00:53:20.883 --> 00:53:22.916
Oh my God.

210
00:53:34.783 --> 00:53:36.616
What the fuck?

211
00:53:41.482 --> 00:53:43.348
Oh, come on.

212
00:53:43.381 --> 00:53:45.649
You've got to be kidding me.

213
00:53:47.516 --> 00:53:49.381
Fuck!

214
00:54:07.314 --> 00:54:09.816
No, wait a minute,
that can't be right.

215
00:54:31.582 --> 00:54:34.314
In the world of quantum science,

216
00:54:34.348 --> 00:54:39.281
anything that can happen,
will happen.

217
00:54:39.314 --> 00:54:43.683
Every choice you make
creates infinite possibilities

218
00:54:43.716 --> 00:54:45.816
and infinite worlds

219
00:54:45.849 --> 00:54:49.883
where each outcome exists.

220
00:54:49.915 --> 00:54:52.915
What if we could see
those possibilities

221
00:54:52.948 --> 00:54:56.649
and choose what outcome
we wanted?

222
00:55:27.882 --> 00:55:32.449
Every choice you make
creates infinite possibilities.

223
00:55:32.482 --> 00:55:35.816
Choose what outcome you wanted.

224
00:55:46.248 --> 00:55:47.649
What?

225
00:55:49.281 --> 00:55:51.214
Oh no.

226
00:56:05.982 --> 00:56:08.649
I'm back here,
what am I doing wrong?

227
00:56:47.616 --> 00:56:50.248
Infinite possibilities?

228
00:56:52.948 --> 00:56:55.915
Infinite possibilities.

229
00:56:58.683 --> 00:57:00.349
The barn.

230
00:57:19.815 --> 00:57:21.449
Come on.

231
00:57:27.815 --> 00:57:29.815
Come on.

232
00:58:08.948 --> 00:58:10.549
She's not there.

233
00:58:11.683 --> 00:58:13.715
She's not there.

234
00:58:22.616 --> 00:58:24.215
Okay.

235
00:58:54.815 --> 00:58:56.948
Where are we?

236
00:58:56.982 --> 00:59:01.482
Okay, what is that, like,
two, three miles?

237
00:59:03.516 --> 00:59:05.482
Okay, three.

238
00:59:10.282 --> 00:59:11.782
Hello?

239
00:59:16.015 --> 00:59:17.416
Yes, I can hear you.

240
00:59:17.449 --> 00:59:18.715
Where are you?

241
00:59:19.782 --> 00:59:21.449
Where are you?

242
00:59:21.482 --> 00:59:25.282
I'm maybe two or three miles
from Wytness.

243
00:59:25.315 --> 00:59:26.616
I'm close.

244
00:59:26.648 --> 00:59:28.382
Are you there?

245
00:59:28.416 --> 00:59:31.915
I'm close, two or three miles
from Wytness.

246
00:59:31.948 --> 00:59:33.582
- Are you there?
- Look, I'll be there

247
00:59:33.616 --> 00:59:36.282
in maybe, I don't know,
an hour?

248
00:59:36.315 --> 00:59:38.815
I'm on foot.

249
00:59:38.848 --> 00:59:40.315
They're coming for me again.

250
00:59:40.349 --> 00:59:41.648
You need to help me.

251
00:59:41.682 --> 00:59:43.748
You need to help me
get out of this.

252
00:59:45.382 --> 00:59:47.549
Get out of what?
What's happening to you?

253
00:59:47.582 --> 00:59:48.349
I don't know, I'm in some kind

254
00:59:48.382 --> 00:59:50.282
of fucked up game,
or something.

255
00:59:50.315 --> 00:59:53.282
It's like a test
and I can't make it stop.

256
00:59:53.315 --> 00:59:55.516
They are using us.

257
00:59:55.549 --> 00:59:56.682
Who are they?

258
00:59:56.715 --> 00:59:57.715
Scientists.

259
00:59:57.748 --> 00:59:59.215
Scientists at Wytness.

260
00:59:59.249 --> 01:00:01.748
You have to be careful.

261
01:00:01.782 --> 01:00:03.782
They will stop at nothing...

262
01:02:05.581 --> 01:02:07.815
What is that?

263
01:03:51.682 --> 01:03:53.615
Hello? Can you hear me?

264
01:04:30.581 --> 01:04:33.648
Excuse me! Hello?

265
01:04:33.682 --> 01:04:35.949
Hello? Hey!

266
01:04:35.983 --> 01:04:38.282
Hello, can you hear me?

267
01:04:38.315 --> 01:04:40.315
Excuse me!

268
01:04:41.816 --> 01:04:43.949
Hello, can you hear me?

269
01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:47.249
Ugh.

270
01:06:04.615 --> 01:06:08.281
What were the results showing
on the last test?

271
01:06:08.314 --> 01:06:10.615
Much the same, I'm afraid.

272
01:06:10.648 --> 01:06:14.215
They all seem to be coming up
against the same problem.

273
01:06:14.248 --> 01:06:15.916
Perfectly equipped...

274
01:06:27.615 --> 01:06:28.916
The trouble is working out

275
01:06:28.949 --> 01:06:30.916
how we get them
to see something

276
01:06:30.949 --> 01:06:32.983
they've never seen before.

277
01:06:33.016 --> 01:06:36.348
There's no context from which
the brain can fabricate.

278
01:06:36.381 --> 01:06:40.448
The limitations of imagination
you could say...

279
01:07:42.548 --> 01:07:44.883
The Americans are leaning on him
to get it done

280
01:07:44.916 --> 01:07:47.515
ever since the Russian incident.

281
01:07:49.716 --> 01:07:52.214
The Americans are leaning on him
to get it done

282
01:07:52.248 --> 01:07:53.515
ever since the Russian incident.

283
01:07:53.548 --> 01:07:56.481
That was never a real threat.

284
01:10:17.281 --> 01:10:19.248
Hello?

285
01:10:20.582 --> 01:10:21.783
Hello!

286
01:10:23.549 --> 01:10:26.348
- Hello!
- That's my concern.

287
01:10:28.415 --> 01:10:30.348
They can't hear me.

288
01:10:39.883 --> 01:10:42.314
They're not there.

289
01:11:49.482 --> 01:11:50.449
It is only now, however,

290
01:11:50.482 --> 01:11:54.816
that we're able to see
behind the curtain.

291
01:11:54.849 --> 01:11:57.616
We've bridged the void
between the worlds,

292
01:11:57.649 --> 01:12:00.516
and through rigorous testing
and endless observation,

293
01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:04.416
we are on the cusp
of propelling human evolution

294
01:12:04.449 --> 01:12:07.915
to a staggering new dimension.

295
01:12:51.015 --> 01:12:52.382
What the hell is this shit?

296
01:13:18.783 --> 01:13:22.683
Welcome. My name is
Professor Aaron Östergaard.

297
01:13:22.716 --> 01:13:25.716
I'm head of Quantum Science
Research Facility

298
01:13:25.749 --> 01:13:27.616
here at Wytness.

299
01:13:27.649 --> 01:13:29.783
In this video,
we will be opening our doors

300
01:13:29.815 --> 01:13:32.915
and showing you exactly
what your vital investment

301
01:13:32.948 --> 01:13:35.815
has enabled us to achieve.

302
01:13:35.848 --> 01:13:38.248
I think you'll be
pretty delighted to discover

303
01:13:38.282 --> 01:13:39.982
how far we've come
in our important work

304
01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:44.848
of developing the human mind
to see infinite possibilities.

305
01:13:48.982 --> 01:13:50.782
What the hell have you done,
professor?

306
01:14:47.948 --> 01:14:50.315
Help! Help!

307
01:14:57.249 --> 01:14:58.848
Oh my God.

308
01:16:32.915 --> 01:16:35.416
Oh, hey, you came back.

309
01:19:58.282 --> 01:20:00.315
Oh, hey.

310
01:20:00.349 --> 01:20:01.715
You came back.

311
01:20:01.748 --> 01:20:04.682
See, I told you, you would.

312
01:20:04.715 --> 01:20:05.883
- What?
- You always do,

313
01:20:05.916 --> 01:20:08.715
it's just what happens.

314
01:20:14.415 --> 01:20:16.682
Well, you're stuck.

315
01:20:16.715 --> 01:20:19.381
Stuck between the worlds;

316
01:20:19.415 --> 01:20:21.282
i... it's a time-loop,

317
01:20:21.315 --> 01:20:25.448
repeating itself
over and over and over again.

318
01:20:27.282 --> 01:20:29.849
You don't believe me, I know.

319
01:20:29.883 --> 01:20:31.249
You didn't the last time either.

320
01:20:33.548 --> 01:20:36.715
This isn't the first time
that you've been here;

321
01:20:36.748 --> 01:20:38.448
won't be the last either.

322
01:20:41.883 --> 01:20:42.883
We're all here...

323
01:20:45.349 --> 01:20:47.615
...all the many possibilities...

324
01:20:48.916 --> 01:20:50.615
...happening all at once.

325
01:20:52.682 --> 01:20:56.949
You're just one outcome
that happens to be lost;

326
01:20:56.983 --> 01:20:58.782
one subject

327
01:20:58.815 --> 01:21:02.215
whose predetermined,
inevitable path

328
01:21:02.249 --> 01:21:04.916
was to be lost.

329
01:21:06.448 --> 01:21:10.883
The probability is there
and you are it.

330
01:21:10.916 --> 01:21:12.916
Over and over and over and over

331
01:21:12.949 --> 01:21:15.615
and over and over
and over again.

332
01:21:17.282 --> 01:21:18.515
Ad infinitum.

333
01:21:24.782 --> 01:21:26.481
Hi!

334
01:21:26.515 --> 01:21:29.481
Yeah, yeah, I'm... I'm good.

335
01:21:29.515 --> 01:21:31.816
Still here.

336
01:21:31.849 --> 01:21:33.883
How are you?

337
01:21:33.916 --> 01:21:37.415
Oh, okay, all right.

338
01:21:37.448 --> 01:21:39.581
We were able to see
behind the curtain.

339
01:21:39.615 --> 01:21:41.282
Infinite possibilities.

340
01:22:29.916 --> 01:22:31.883
Please stop.

341
01:22:45.716 --> 01:22:50.281
Preparing to disconnect subject
on three, two, one.
