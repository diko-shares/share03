00:00:34.616 --> 00:00:38.616
{\an3}Well, it all started with
the great Professor Östergaard

2
00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.215
{\an3}and his discovery
of the paraverse

3
00:00:41.248 --> 00:00:42.649
as we now know it.

4
00:00:42.683 --> 00:00:44.583
The exploration
into the capability

5
00:00:44.616 --> 00:00:46.281
of the human mind
is not a new one.

6
00:00:55.281 --> 00:00:58.549
{\an1}We discovered that the paraverse
was much like our own world,

7
00:00:58.583 --> 00:01:02.281
{\an1}except that it had been
at war for many years.

8
00:01:02.315 --> 00:01:04.483
{\an1}This gave us
the perfect environment

9
00:01:04.516 --> 00:01:07.583
in which to carry out
what had previously only been

10
00:01:07.616 --> 00:01:09.383
hypothetical theory.

11
00:01:09.416 --> 00:01:13.416
CIA were working
on MK-Ultra from the 1950s,

12
00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:15.948
and the Russians had
their studies on psychokinesis

13
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:17.081
in the same period.

14
00:01:24.248 --> 00:01:28.449
In more recent times,
the U.S. Navy had detachment G,

15
00:01:28.483 --> 00:01:31.616
and we here at Wytness
have been working in the field

16
00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.449
for, oh,

17
00:01:33.483 --> 00:01:34.683
nearly 25 years.

18
00:01:40.516 --> 00:01:42.181
Don't move!

19
00:01:44.048 --> 00:01:45.215
It is only now, however,

20
00:01:45.248 --> 00:01:49.349
that we are able to see
behind the curtain.

21
00:01:49.383 --> 00:01:53.549
We've bridged the void
between the worlds.

22
00:01:53.583 --> 00:01:56.416
And through rigorous testing
and endless observation,

23
00:01:56.449 --> 00:02:00.349
we are on the cusp
of propelling human evolution

24
00:02:00.383 --> 00:02:02.549
to a staggering new dimension.

25
00:05:15.082 --> 00:05:16.648
Help!

26
00:05:18.116 --> 00:05:18.981
Help!

27
00:05:29.048 --> 00:05:32.116
...is Professor Östergaard,

28
00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:35.416
head of Quantum science
research facility here at...

29
00:05:52.116 --> 00:05:54.216
What's happening?

30
00:06:26.483 --> 00:06:30.082
I think you'll be
pretty delighted to discover...

31
00:06:48.582 --> 00:06:49.615
I don't like it.

32
00:06:49.648 --> 00:06:51.082
What should we do?

33
00:06:51.116 --> 00:06:53.282
Uh, I think we should reset.

34
00:06:53.316 --> 00:06:54.948
Let's just see how it plays out.

35
00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:57.015
No, no, something's not right...

36
00:07:57.349 --> 00:07:58.548
Where is everyone?

37
00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:06.015
I need to get out of here.

38
00:08:06.049 --> 00:08:09.448
Okay, they got me in here,

39
00:08:09.482 --> 00:08:12.182
so there's gotta be a way out.

40
00:08:41.282 --> 00:08:43.349
There's gotta be a way out.

41
00:08:47.715 --> 00:08:49.648
There's gotta be a way out.

42
00:08:52.515 --> 00:08:55.182
There's gotta...

43
00:09:02.415 --> 00:09:04.915
I think you'll be
pretty delighted to discover

44
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:06.615
how far we've come
in our important work

45
00:09:06.648 --> 00:09:11.582
of developing the human mind
to see infinite possibilities.

46
00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:05.949
What is this place?

47
00:12:47.716 --> 00:12:49.415
Fuck!

48
00:14:35.215 --> 00:14:37.915
We needed the subject
to feel threatened

49
00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:39.415
and in real jeopardy.

50
00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:44.148
But it wasn't until
we had developed

51
00:14:44.181 --> 00:14:45.415
the Kairos generator

52
00:14:45.448 --> 00:14:48.081
that we were able to
control the experiment.

53
00:14:52.348 --> 00:14:55.915
We needed a constant,
and that had to be time.

54
00:16:13.248 --> 00:16:15.248
- What do you think?
- The subject's unstable.

55
00:16:15.281 --> 00:16:16.583
We need to request a reset.

56
00:16:16.616 --> 00:16:19.081
I'm really not sure
we should carry on...

57
00:16:19.115 --> 00:16:20.248
Wait, is she...

58
00:16:20.281 --> 00:16:22.281
We need to reset right now!

59
00:17:22.148 --> 00:17:24.014
Where the fuck am I?

60
00:17:46.115 --> 00:17:47.349
Wait.

61
00:19:21.649 --> 00:19:23.416
Let's try this one.

62
00:19:26.181 --> 00:19:28.516
Come on, there's an entrance
on the other side.

63
00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:01.683
- Anything?
- No, the place looks dead.

64
00:20:01.715 --> 00:20:03.081
Why are we even here?

65
00:20:03.115 --> 00:20:04.483
She could be miles away by now.

66
00:20:04.516 --> 00:20:07.249
Right, let's move
to the next sector.

67
00:20:07.282 --> 00:20:10.583
Base this is Unit 7,
we're moving on.

68
00:21:25.948 --> 00:21:28.516
The many worlds interpretation

69
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:31.682
states that
the universal wave-function

70
00:21:31.715 --> 00:21:35.349
is objectively real...

71
00:21:59.216 --> 00:22:02.149
Yes!

72
00:23:05.483 --> 00:23:07.615
Right.

73
00:23:07.648 --> 00:23:09.615
If I was a key,

74
00:23:09.648 --> 00:23:12.182
where would I be?

75
00:23:20.548 --> 00:23:22.515
There's nothing here.

76
00:24:00.316 --> 00:24:02.049
How?

77
00:24:20.383 --> 00:24:21.216
Come on.

78
00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:29.416
Come on!

79
00:24:29.448 --> 00:24:30.548
Ugh!

80
00:24:30.582 --> 00:24:33.216
Fuck!

81
00:25:28.249 --> 00:25:29.216
Hello?

82
00:26:00.348 --> 00:26:01.615
Wait!

83
00:26:14.049 --> 00:26:15.316
Hello?

84
00:26:44.348 --> 00:26:46.216
Car doesn't start.

85
00:26:47.982 --> 00:26:49.482
How do I know that?

86
00:27:01.282 --> 00:27:03.548
So weird.

87
00:27:03.582 --> 00:27:04.949
I knew it.

88
00:27:19.216 --> 00:27:22.216
Wytness Research Centre

89
00:27:22.249 --> 00:27:26.482
Beacon Hall, 377891.

90
00:27:28.615 --> 00:27:30.448
North Sector.

91
00:27:41.415 --> 00:27:42.382
Hello?

92
00:28:16.315 --> 00:28:19.082
The many worlds interpretation

93
00:28:19.116 --> 00:28:22.215
states that
the universal wave-function

94
00:28:22.248 --> 00:28:24.415
is objectively real....

95
00:29:22.315 --> 00:29:23.415
Hello?

96
00:30:06.949 --> 00:30:08.382
Someone there?

97
00:31:26.949 --> 00:31:27.982
Yes!

98
00:32:13.315 --> 00:32:15.348
Come on!

99
00:32:15.382 --> 00:32:18.281
Ugh, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

100
00:32:18.315 --> 00:32:20.348
Ugh, shit!

101
00:32:46.415 --> 00:32:50.048
My name is Professor
Aaron Östergaard,

102
00:32:50.081 --> 00:32:53.148
I'm head of Quantum
science and research

103
00:32:53.181 --> 00:32:56.649
here at Wytness.

104
00:32:56.683 --> 00:32:58.081
Wytness.

105
00:33:04.081 --> 00:33:06.382
Wytness Research Centre.

106
00:33:47.716 --> 00:33:49.449
This isn't right.

107
00:35:00.048 --> 00:35:01.581
Hmmph.

108
00:35:09.115 --> 00:35:10.914
What?

109
00:35:46.416 --> 00:35:47.948
Picked up movement!

110
00:35:47.981 --> 00:35:48.914
Go!

111
00:35:56.583 --> 00:35:58.249
There, on the other side.

112
00:35:58.282 --> 00:35:59.316
Go!

113
00:36:23.383 --> 00:36:25.383
They've got a scent.

114
00:36:25.416 --> 00:36:27.181
Spread out.

115
00:36:30.716 --> 00:36:31.948
Listen.

116
00:36:34.549 --> 00:36:36.048
She's in there.

117
00:37:21.549 --> 00:37:22.548
Hmmph.

118
00:37:29.182 --> 00:37:33.349
Ah, ah, ah.

119
00:37:58.583 --> 00:37:59.948
Come on.

120
00:38:06.483 --> 00:38:08.182
Yes!

121
00:39:09.715 --> 00:39:10.948
Hello?

122
00:39:17.416 --> 00:39:18.914
Hello?

123
00:39:18.948 --> 00:39:21.249
Please, can you hear me?

124
00:39:24.182 --> 00:39:26.615
Hello, can you hear me?

125
00:39:26.648 --> 00:39:28.548
Hello, can you hear me?

126
00:39:28.582 --> 00:39:31.282
Yes! Yes!

127
00:39:31.316 --> 00:39:34.582
Oh, thank God.

128
00:39:34.615 --> 00:39:37.082
Oh, thank God.

129
00:39:37.116 --> 00:39:38.548
Where are you?

130
00:39:38.582 --> 00:39:39.615
Tell me where you are,

131
00:39:39.648 --> 00:39:41.182
and I'll come and find you.

132
00:39:41.216 --> 00:39:42.483
Look, I don't know where I am.

133
00:39:42.516 --> 00:39:43.682
I'm lost, and...

134
00:39:43.715 --> 00:39:45.948
No, no, no, you must be close
'cause I can hear you.

135
00:39:45.981 --> 00:39:47.582
Jus-just tell me where you are.

136
00:39:47.615 --> 00:39:49.049
They're here.

137
00:39:51.548 --> 00:39:54.116
Wa- who-who is?

138
00:39:54.149 --> 00:39:55.981
Who are they? W-what do they want?

139
00:39:56.015 --> 00:39:59.182
I don't know, look,
I can't, I've got to go.

140
00:40:01.982 --> 00:40:03.082
I can't, I can't hear you.

141
00:40:03.116 --> 00:40:04.548
Look, tell me where you are.

142
00:40:09.316 --> 00:40:11.015
Please hello,
are you still there?

143
00:40:16.216 --> 00:40:19.149
Please, please,

144
00:40:19.182 --> 00:40:20.416
please don't go.

145
00:40:25.682 --> 00:40:27.316
Fuck!

146
00:40:55.482 --> 00:40:59.482
Okay, so if I was coming down...

147
00:40:59.515 --> 00:41:01.216
there,

148
00:41:01.249 --> 00:41:02.548
left?

149
00:41:32.182 --> 00:41:33.482
What the fuck?

150
00:42:00.482 --> 00:42:02.015
Fuuuck!

151
00:42:04.982 --> 00:42:08.282
Repetition of the same day
allows us our constant

152
00:42:08.316 --> 00:42:10.615
when everything else
is variable.

153
00:42:10.648 --> 00:42:13.049
Being able to reset the subjects

154
00:42:13.082 --> 00:42:16.349
when their key psychological
indicators overload

155
00:42:16.382 --> 00:42:18.949
has enabled us to
track the development

156
00:42:18.982 --> 00:42:21.316
of the subject's abilities,

157
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:23.049
and to see how close they are

158
00:42:23.082 --> 00:42:26.448
to pre-seeing possibilities,

159
00:42:26.482 --> 00:42:29.316
and eventually controlling

160
00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:32.482
reality itself.

161
00:43:13.582 --> 00:43:15.049
Aaagh!

162
00:43:15.082 --> 00:43:16.949
Come on!

163
00:43:21.382 --> 00:43:22.382
Of course.

164
00:43:36.015 --> 00:43:37.648
Okay.

165
00:46:10.248 --> 00:46:12.949
Hello, is there anyone there?

166
00:46:18.015 --> 00:46:19.649
Hello?

167
00:46:53.215 --> 00:46:55.049
Hello?

168
00:46:55.082 --> 00:46:57.215
Hello can you hear me?

169
00:46:57.248 --> 00:46:59.348
Yes, hello, I can hear you.

170
00:47:01.616 --> 00:47:04.616
Hello, are you still there?

171
00:47:04.649 --> 00:47:07.049
I'm here...

172
00:47:07.081 --> 00:47:08.949
Can barely hear you.

173
00:47:08.982 --> 00:47:10.982
I'm so glad you're okay.

174
00:47:11.015 --> 00:47:12.315
What happened before?

175
00:47:12.348 --> 00:47:14.081
Where did you go?

176
00:47:14.115 --> 00:47:16.215
Was someone chasing you?

177
00:47:16.248 --> 00:47:18.915
There were soldiers everywhere.

178
00:47:18.949 --> 00:47:21.281
They're trying to take me back.

179
00:47:21.315 --> 00:47:24.448
Yes, the soldiers,
I... I can hear them at night,

180
00:47:24.482 --> 00:47:25.616
I see their lights.

181
00:47:25.649 --> 00:47:28.448
I haven't seen.. them.

182
00:47:28.482 --> 00:47:30.015
I haven't seen anyone.

183
00:47:30.049 --> 00:47:30.915
Come at night.

184
00:47:30.949 --> 00:47:34.015
Just keep moving okay,
don't stop.

185
00:47:34.049 --> 00:47:36.549
I'm.. trying to get
to this place,

186
00:47:36.583 --> 00:47:39.215
it's, um, a research centre.

187
00:47:39.248 --> 00:47:42.982
I... I don't know why,
but I-I think it might help.

188
00:47:43.015 --> 00:47:44.649
Wytness...

189
00:47:44.683 --> 00:47:45.915
...all started...

190
00:47:45.949 --> 00:47:47.382
Wait, did you just say Wytness?

191
00:47:47.415 --> 00:47:49.015
That's it, that's the place!

192
00:47:51.382 --> 00:47:53.982
Hello, you still there?

193
00:47:57.348 --> 00:48:02.048
Look, if you can hear me,
meet me at Wytness.

194
00:48:05.281 --> 00:48:07.215
Hello?

195
00:49:39.382 --> 00:49:41.081
Tracks go this way.

196
00:49:41.115 --> 00:49:43.148
Yeah, they're fresh.

197
00:49:43.181 --> 00:49:44.915
She can't have gone far.

198
00:49:44.948 --> 00:49:46.649
What do we do when we find her?

199
00:49:46.683 --> 00:49:48.348
- Reset again?
- No,

200
00:49:48.382 --> 00:49:50.649
they said to drive her forwards,
see what she does.

201
00:49:50.683 --> 00:49:52.248
They're really pushing this one.

202
00:49:52.281 --> 00:49:53.549
Why the hurry?

203
00:49:53.583 --> 00:49:54.449
How should I know?

204
00:49:56.315 --> 00:49:57.281
Go!

205
00:50:00.148 --> 00:50:01.616
Move, move, move!

206
00:51:53.483 --> 00:51:55.316
I'm still here.

207
00:51:56.948 --> 00:51:59.181
I didn't go back.

208
00:53:29.583 --> 00:53:31.616
Oh my God.

209
00:53:43.483 --> 00:53:45.316
What the fuck?

210
00:53:50.182 --> 00:53:52.048
Oh, come on.

211
00:53:52.081 --> 00:53:54.349
You've got to be kidding me.

212
00:53:56.216 --> 00:53:58.081
Fuck!

213
00:54:16.014 --> 00:54:18.516
No wait a minute,
that can't be right.

214
00:54:40.282 --> 00:54:43.014
In the world of quantum science,

215
00:54:43.048 --> 00:54:47.981
anything that can happen,
will happen.

216
00:54:48.014 --> 00:54:52.383
Every choice you make
creates infinite possibilities

217
00:54:52.416 --> 00:54:54.516
and infinite worlds,

218
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:58.583
where each outcome exists.

219
00:54:58.615 --> 00:55:01.615
What if we could see
those possibilities

220
00:55:01.648 --> 00:55:05.349
and choose what outcome
we wanted?

221
00:55:36.582 --> 00:55:41.149
Every choice you make
creates infinite possibilities.

222
00:55:41.182 --> 00:55:44.516
Choose what outcome you wanted.

223
00:55:54.948 --> 00:55:56.349
What?

224
00:55:57.981 --> 00:55:59.914
Oh no.

225
00:56:14.682 --> 00:56:17.349
I'm back here,
what am I doing wrong?

226
00:56:56.316 --> 00:56:58.948
Infinite possibilities?

227
00:57:01.648 --> 00:57:04.615
Infinite.. possibilities.

228
00:57:07.383 --> 00:57:09.049
The barn.

229
00:57:28.515 --> 00:57:30.149
Come on.

230
00:57:36.515 --> 00:57:38.515
Come on.

231
00:58:17.648 --> 00:58:19.249
She's not there.

232
00:58:20.383 --> 00:58:22.415
She's not there.

233
00:58:31.316 --> 00:58:32.915
Okay.

234
00:59:03.515 --> 00:59:05.648
Where are we?

235
00:59:05.682 --> 00:59:10.182
Okay, what is that like,
two, three miles?

236
00:59:12.216 --> 00:59:14.182
Okay, three.

237
00:59:18.982 --> 00:59:20.482
Hello?

238
00:59:24.715 --> 00:59:25.900
Yes, I can hear you.

239
00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:27.415
Uh, where are you?

240
00:59:28.482 --> 00:59:30.149
Where are you?

241
00:59:30.182 --> 00:59:33.982
I'm.. maybe, two or three miles
from Wytness.

242
00:59:34.015 --> 00:59:35.316
I'm close.

243
00:59:35.348 --> 00:59:37.082
Are you there?

244
00:59:37.116 --> 00:59:40.615
I'm close, two or three miles
from Wytness.

245
00:59:40.648 --> 00:59:42.282
- Are you there?
- Look I'll be there

246
00:59:42.316 --> 00:59:44.800
in maybe, I don't know an hour?

247
00:59:44.815 --> 00:59:47.515
I'm-I'm on foot.

248
00:59:47.548 --> 00:59:49.015
They're coming for me again.

249
00:59:49.049 --> 00:59:50.348
You need to help me.

250
00:59:50.382 --> 00:59:52.448
You need to help me
get out of this.

251
00:59:54.082 --> 00:59:56.249
Get out of what?
What's happening to you?

252
00:59:56.282 --> 00:59:57.049
I don't know, I'm in some kind

253
00:59:57.082 --> 00:59:58.982
of fucked-up game,
or something.

254
00:59:59.015 --> 01:00:01.982
It's like a test
and I can't make it stop.

255
01:00:02.015 --> 01:00:04.216
They are using us.

256
01:00:04.249 --> 01:00:05.382
Who are they?

257
01:00:05.415 --> 01:00:06.415
Scientists.

258
01:00:06.448 --> 01:00:07.915
Scientists at Wytness.

259
01:00:07.949 --> 01:00:10.448
You have to be careful.

260
01:00:10.482 --> 01:00:12.482
They will stop, at nothing...

261
01:02:14.281 --> 01:02:16.515
What is that?

262
01:04:00.382 --> 01:04:02.315
Hello? Can you hear me?

263
01:04:39.281 --> 01:04:42.348
Excuse me! Hello?

264
01:04:42.382 --> 01:04:44.649
Hello? Hey!

265
01:04:44.683 --> 01:04:46.982
Hello can you hear me?

266
01:04:47.015 --> 01:04:49.015
Excuse me!

267
01:04:50.516 --> 01:04:52.649
Hello can you hear me?

268
01:04:54.415 --> 01:04:55.949
Uhhh.

269
01:06:13.315 --> 01:06:16.981
What were the results showing
on the last test?

270
01:06:17.014 --> 01:06:19.315
Much the same, I'm afraid.

271
01:06:19.348 --> 01:06:22.915
They all seem to be coming up
against the same problem.

272
01:06:22.948 --> 01:06:24.996
Perfectly equipped
to select people...

273
01:06:36.315 --> 01:06:37.616
The trouble is, working out

274
01:06:37.649 --> 01:06:39.616
how we get them
to see something

275
01:06:39.649 --> 01:06:41.683
they've never seen before.

276
01:06:41.716 --> 01:06:45.048
There's no context from which
the brain can fabricate.

277
01:06:45.081 --> 01:06:49.148
The limitations of imagination
you could say...

278
01:07:51.248 --> 01:07:53.583
The Americans are leaning on him
to get it done

279
01:07:53.616 --> 01:07:56.215
ever since the Russian incident.

280
01:07:58.416 --> 01:08:00.914
The Americans are leaning on him
to get it done

281
01:08:00.948 --> 01:08:02.215
ever since the Russian incident.

282
01:08:02.248 --> 01:08:05.181
That was never a real threat.

283
01:10:25.981 --> 01:10:27.948
Hello?

284
01:10:29.282 --> 01:10:30.483
Hello!

285
01:10:32.249 --> 01:10:35.048
- Hello!
- That's my concern.

286
01:10:37.115 --> 01:10:39.048
They can't hear me.

287
01:10:48.583 --> 01:10:51.014
They're not there.

288
01:11:58.182 --> 01:11:59.149
It is only now however

289
01:11:59.182 --> 01:12:03.516
that we're able to see
behind the curtain.

290
01:12:03.549 --> 01:12:06.316
We've bridged the void
between the worlds,

291
01:12:06.349 --> 01:12:09.216
and through rigorous testing
and endless observation,

292
01:12:09.249 --> 01:12:13.116
we are on the cusp,
of propelling human evolution

293
01:12:13.149 --> 01:12:16.615
to a staggering new dimension.

294
01:12:59.715 --> 01:13:01.082
What the hell is this shit?

295
01:13:27.483 --> 01:13:31.383
Welcome. My name is
Professor Aaron Östergaard.

296
01:13:31.416 --> 01:13:34.416
I'm head of Quantum Science
Research Facility

297
01:13:34.449 --> 01:13:36.316
here at Wytness.

298
01:13:36.349 --> 01:13:38.483
In this video,
we will be opening our doors

299
01:13:38.515 --> 01:13:41.615
and showing you exactly
what your vital investment

300
01:13:41.648 --> 01:13:44.515
has enabled us to achieve.

301
01:13:44.548 --> 01:13:46.948
I think you'll be
pretty delighted to discover

302
01:13:46.982 --> 01:13:48.682
how far we've come
in our important work

303
01:13:48.715 --> 01:13:53.548
of developing the human mind
to see infinite possibilities.

304
01:13:57.682 --> 01:13:59.482
What the hell have you done,
professor?

305
01:14:56.648 --> 01:14:59.015
Help! Help!

306
01:15:05.949 --> 01:15:07.548
Oh my God.

307
01:16:41.615 --> 01:16:44.116
Oh hey, you came back.

308
01:20:06.782 --> 01:20:09.015
Oh hey.

309
01:20:09.049 --> 01:20:10.415
You came back.

310
01:20:10.448 --> 01:20:13.382
See, I told you, you would.

311
01:20:13.415 --> 01:20:14.583
- What?
- You always do,

312
01:20:14.616 --> 01:20:17.415
it's.. just, what happens.

313
01:20:23.115 --> 01:20:25.382
When you're stuck.

314
01:20:25.415 --> 01:20:28.081
Stuck between the worlds;

315
01:20:28.115 --> 01:20:29.982
it-it's a time-loop,

316
01:20:30.015 --> 01:20:34.148
repeating itself
over and over and over again.

317
01:20:35.982 --> 01:20:38.549
You don't believe me, I know.

318
01:20:38.583 --> 01:20:39.949
You didn't the last time either.

319
01:20:42.248 --> 01:20:45.415
This isn't the first time
that you've been here;

320
01:20:45.448 --> 01:20:47.148
won't be the last either.

321
01:20:50.583 --> 01:20:51.583
We're all here...

322
01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:56.315
...all the many possibilities...

323
01:20:57.616 --> 01:20:59.315
...happening all at once.

324
01:21:01.382 --> 01:21:05.649
You're just one outcome
that happens to be lost;

325
01:21:05.683 --> 01:21:07.482
one, subject

326
01:21:07.515 --> 01:21:10.915
whose.. predetermined,
inevitable path

327
01:21:10.949 --> 01:21:13.616
was to be lost.

328
01:21:15.148 --> 01:21:19.583
The probability is there and..
you are it.

329
01:21:19.616 --> 01:21:21.616
Over and over and over and over

330
01:21:21.649 --> 01:21:24.315
and over and over
and over again.

331
01:21:25.982 --> 01:21:27.215
Ad infinitum.

332
01:21:33.482 --> 01:21:35.181
Hi!

333
01:21:35.215 --> 01:21:38.181
Yeah, yeah, I-I-I'm good.

334
01:21:38.215 --> 01:21:40.516
Still here, obviously.

335
01:21:40.549 --> 01:21:42.583
How are you?

336
01:21:42.616 --> 01:21:46.115
Oh, okay, alright.

337
01:21:46.148 --> 01:21:48.281
We were able to see
behind the curtain.

338
01:21:48.315 --> 01:21:49.982
Infinite possibilities.

339
01:22:38.616 --> 01:22:40.583
Please stop.

340
01:22:54.416 --> 01:22:58.981
Preparing to disconnect subject
on three, two, one.

341
01:23:03.792 --> 01:23:16.375
INFINITY
Unknown Dimension

342
01:23:17.292 --> 01:23:21.417
For Patrick Butler

343
01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:27.500
This movie was taken - written
and shot - during the lockdown
due to the covid-19 pandemic in 2020.

344
01:23:27.501 --> 01:23:29.917
The post-processing was remotely done.
