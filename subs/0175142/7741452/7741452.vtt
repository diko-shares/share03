00:00:39.957 --> 00:00:42.918
- Hello?
- Wanna have fun?

2
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.838
- Who is this?
- Tell me your name and I'll tell you mine.

3
00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:48.006
I don't think so.

4
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.843
- What's that noise?
- Oops. I farted.

5
00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:54.096
- I didn't think you would hear me.
- No, that popping noise.

6
00:00:54.138 --> 00:00:58.142
Oh! I'm making popcorn.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.

7
00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:01.812
- Ooh! What is it?
- It's just a scary movie.

8
00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.022
- Do you like scary movies?
- Mm-hm.

9
00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:07.526
- What's your favourite?
- Mm, I don't know.

10
00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:09.194
Think.

11
00:01:09.278 --> 00:01:12.948
Oh, I know. <i>Kazaam</i> - you know,
the one where Shaq plays a genie?

12
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.702
- That's not a horror movie.
- Well, you haven't seen Shaq act.

13
00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:21.540
- Hey, you have a nice voice.
- Thanks.

14
00:01:21.623 --> 00:01:23.917
You never did tell me your name.

15
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:26.128
Why do you wanna know my name?

16
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.256
Cos I wanna know who I'm looking at.

17
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:32.843
What... what did you say?

18
00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:35.179
Nice breasts.

19
00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:37.055
Look, what do you want?

20
00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:39.850
I wanna see
what your insides look like.

21
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.478
Well, then turn to page 54.

22
00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:44.521
Oh.

23
00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:46.231
Hey, nice!

24
00:01:48.025 --> 00:01:50.068
Listen, asshole, you've had your fun.

25
00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:53.197
- Now you'd better stop, or else.
- Or else what?

26
00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:57.493
Or else my boyfriend's gonna be here any
minute. He's black, and he'll kick your ass.

27
00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:58.869
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

28
00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:01.705
The one who wears makeup
and dresses like a woman?

29
00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.459
- How did you know?
- Turn the porch lights on.

30
00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:14.051
Help! Help!

31
00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:16.011
Oh, that's not my boyfriend.

32
00:02:16.053 --> 00:02:18.597
I've fucked him a couple of times,
but that's it.

33
00:02:19.932 --> 00:02:24.353
- Look, I'm calling the cops.
- Go ahead. Call the cops.

34
00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:27.272
But you might wanna
check the back door first.

35
00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:29.525
You forgot to lock it.

36
00:02:52.256 --> 00:02:54.842
Take that, you psycho!

37
00:02:58.262 --> 00:02:59.972
I can't feel my legs.

38
00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:02.391
I think my arm is broken.

39
00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:06.103
- Sorry.
- I want my mommy.

40
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:11.024
Hello, Drew.

41
00:03:17.281 --> 00:03:19.283
Oh, God!

42
00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:27.291
Oh, God!

43
00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:30.460
Oh, God!

44
00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:18.050
No!

45
00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:27.434
Hm?

46
00:04:30.354 --> 00:04:33.231
Daddy! Daddy!

47
00:04:33.315 --> 00:04:34.524
Ugh!

48
00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:36.610
Daddy!

49
00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:38.695
Daddy!

50
00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:40.989
Daddy, no! No!

51
00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:47.871
- Did you hear something?
- No, I didn't hear anything.

52
00:05:16.108 --> 00:05:19.111
Bobby! What are you doing?
My dad's in the other room.

53
00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:21.822
It occurred to me
I never climbed through your window.

54
00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:25.200
Now that you got it out of your system,
Bobby, you got to leave.

55
00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:26.910
Why?

56
00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:29.329
Shh. Come on.

57
00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:31.999
What's going on in there?
Agh! Ow!

58
00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:36.253
Daddy's head is stuck.
Unstick Daddy's head. Ohh!

59
00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:38.463
- Dad, can you knock?
- Knock?

60
00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:42.300
- I thought I heard screaming in here.
- No. No, you didn't, Dad.

61
00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:45.053
It could've been that crack
I smoked earlier, I guess.

62
00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:46.972
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's what it was.

63
00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:51.977
I gotta leave town for a couple of days - that
business I started with the Colombians.

64
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.896
- Oh, you mean Uncle Escobar.
- Yeah, that's right.

65
00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:57.441
There's a problem.
Some money went missing.

66
00:05:57.524 --> 00:06:01.611
Apparently, legs are gonna get broken.
It's better if I lay low for a couple of days.

67
00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:04.448
- If the cops raid the place...
- I never heard of you.

68
00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:06.658
- And don't forget...
- To flush your stash.

69
00:06:06.742 --> 00:06:09.828
Oh, you are my little girl.
I love you so much...

70
00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:12.789
- I left you something in the coffee can.
- Dad.

71
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:15.667
But you have to remember to step on it
before you sell it.

72
00:06:15.751 --> 00:06:18.670
- Now, what are you gonna cut it with?
- Um, baking...

73
00:06:18.754 --> 00:06:20.464
Baking soda.
Not baking powder.

74
00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:24.301
Because baking powder guys
will have muffins growing out of their nose.

75
00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:29.431
You love that joke, don't you? You've loved
that joke since you were two years old.

76
00:06:29.473 --> 00:06:31.391
- OK, well...
- OK, I love you.

77
00:06:31.475 --> 00:06:33.727
- I love you.
- Have a good trip.

78
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.437
- Bye.
- Bye.

79
00:06:37.314 --> 00:06:41.443
Is the coast clear?
Oh, Cindy, that nightgown!

80
00:06:41.485 --> 00:06:44.488
That was close. God!

81
00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:53.205
I was, uh, home watching The <i>Exorcist,</i>
and it got me thinking about you.

82
00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:57.417
If this is about the time I puked green slime
and masturbated with a crucifix...

83
00:06:57.501 --> 00:06:59.669
It was my first keg party, Bobby.

84
00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:01.421
No. No.

85
00:07:01.505 --> 00:07:04.299
It was edited for TV.
All the good stuff was cutout.

86
00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:07.135
So you thought you would
just climb through my window

87
00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:09.429
and we would play bump-bump?

88
00:07:09.513 --> 00:07:11.598
I was kind of hoping
to get my balls licked,

89
00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:14.643
but I wouldn't wanna break
your little underwear rule.

90
00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:17.813
So maybe just some
on-top-of-the-clothes type stuff?

91
00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:22.234
OK.

92
00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:24.319
But just for a minute.

93
00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:41.086
What the...?

94
00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:43.672
Wrong set.

95
00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:48.677
Bobby...

96
00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.137
Oh, Bobby...

97
00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:57.269
- No, Bobby, don't.
- Ow!

98
00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.564
Jeez.

99
00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:03.024
- I see.
- Yeah, my dad.

100
00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:07.737
OK, stud...
you have to go now.

101
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.536
Oh, um, about the sex stuff?

102
00:08:14.578 --> 00:08:17.455
I was only half serious.
I don't wanna rush you.

103
00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:20.417
Hey, would you settle for PG-13?

104
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.502
What's that?

105
00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:26.173
Oh, jeez!

106
00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:28.550
Good night, Bobby.

107
00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:37.100
Shorty, you are so loud!

108
00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:39.561
Make sure you take
your behind to class today.

109
00:08:39.603 --> 00:08:43.023
- I do be going to class.
- Lunch is not a class, Shorty.

110
00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:45.692
It is when you got the munchies.

111
00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:49.654
- See, that's why you such a dumbass.
- Your mother.

112
00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:53.617
You my brother.
That's your mother too, jackass.

113
00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:57.120
Oh, yeah.
Well, then, your father's stupid.

114
00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:59.706
So? I don't know him.

115
00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:02.667
Yeah, me neither.

116
00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:06.546
- Hey, girl, you ready?
- Yeah, in a minute.

117
00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:11.718
- Come on, we're gonna be late.
- Wait. There's Buffy.

118
00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:15.889
I don't know why you hang out with her.
She is such a ho!

119
00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:19.100
- Why do you say that?
- Cos I've seen her.

120
00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:22.312
- My friend Sean had a pool party...
- Sean?

121
00:09:22.354 --> 00:09:24.147
You know, Puff Daddy?

122
00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:26.900
Anyway, everybody was drinking
Cristal champagne.

123
00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:30.153
Then it got wild,
and people were getting freaky in the pool.

124
00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:35.116
I look over, and there was your girl
getting buck-wild in the Jacuzzi.

125
00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:38.536
- So?
- With a backup dancer!

126
00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:43.250
I mean, that's nasty.
That's lower than the security guard.

127
00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:47.545
At least security can get you backstage.
She don't love herself.

128
00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:51.049
- Bye, Daddy.
- I don't know. I think Buffy's sweet, Brenda.

129
00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:54.094
She is as fake as press-on nails.

130
00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:58.640
- Hey, baby girl!
- Hi. Hi.

131
00:09:58.682 --> 00:10:00.392
What is up, my sister?

132
00:10:00.475 --> 00:10:03.395
- Bye, Mr Gilmore.
- Bye!

133
00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:05.689
- Is he gone?
- Yep.

134
00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:14.531
Hey, Cindy!

135
00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:21.371
- I love this colour.
- Let me see that.

136
00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:25.709
Oh, you guys should not use this brand.

137
00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:28.753
- Why not?
- Cos they test their products on animals.

138
00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:30.380
- So?
- Look.

139
00:10:30.422 --> 00:10:34.301
Have you seen what they do
to those poor animals?

140
00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:39.806
Well, I am much more
of a people person.

141
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:43.143
I'd like to feed all the hungry
little children of the world.

142
00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:45.770
- I'd rather help my fellow man...
- Spare a dollar?

143
00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:48.398
- Get away from me, you burn!
- Buffy!

144
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.734
Can't you see he's just hungry?

145
00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:53.611
Here you go, sir.
A nice sandwich.

146
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.408
- See?
- I said a dollar, bitch!

147
00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:00.744
Ow!

148
00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:03.997
God! Look at this place.

149
00:11:04.456 --> 00:11:06.416
It's a circus.

150
00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:11.296
Hello. I'm Gail Hailstorm, author of
the book <i>You're Dead, I'm Rich.</i>

151
00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:15.884
A small college town is in shock
after the unthinkable has happened:

152
00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:18.678
a brutal killing spree
that left one teen dead...

153
00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:21.389
That's it! ..Two teens dead,

154
00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:23.808
and this small town
shaken and stirred.

155
00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:27.270
- It's times like these...
- Police are combing the area for clues.

156
00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:29.773
There are no witnesses
available at this time.

157
00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:33.276
There are no suspects in custody.
Police are asking anyone...

158
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.781
Reporting live for Black TV. White folks are
dead, and we're getting the fuck outta here!

159
00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:42.202
Grab your shit and let's go, motherfucker!
Let's go!

160
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.831
Hey, do you think the press
is gonna wanna talk to us?

161
00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:51.878
Oh, no. The press only wants to interview
the most ignorant person they can find.

162
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:55.715
I'm on TV! Oh, shit!
First Cops, now this!

163
00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:57.675
I'm gonna be a star!

164
00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:02.138
- What can you tell us about Drew?
- Well, she had the phat ass.

165
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.350
- I mean, it was, like, bang!
- How close were you to the victim?

166
00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:10.230
Real close. Until the roofies were off. She
woke up talking about pressing charges,

167
00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:12.565
so I pulled my tongue
out of her ass and left.

168
00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:14.818
What would have been
your last words to Drew?

169
00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:18.029
Run, bitch! Run!

170
00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:24.786
Hey, yo, dog.
Does this shirt make me look gay?

171
00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:26.830
No, man.

172
00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:31.793
- What about now?
- Nah.

173
00:12:31.835 --> 00:12:33.336
- Cool?
- Yeah.

174
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.505
Don't forget: election's Tuesday.

175
00:12:35.547 --> 00:12:37.632
Don't forget: election's Tuesday.

176
00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:40.301
Oh! Goddammit!

177
00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:42.887
Son of a bitch!

178
00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:46.015
What's the matter, honey?

179
00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:49.102
My report card.

180
00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:53.022
Well, at least you got one "A".

181
00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:56.109
- Yeah. I did, huh?
- Yeah.

182
00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:58.987
You're so smart.

183
00:12:59.028 --> 00:13:02.115
- Hey, has anybody seen Bobby?
- Nah.

184
00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:04.200
You know what?
That kid is always late.

185
00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:06.786
I don't get it.
He lives so close.

186
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.257
See you later,
Hairy Mama, Bubba, Jim,

187
00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.260
Big Jim, Little Jim,
Slim Jim, everybody.

188
00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:25.847
I'll see you later.
<i>Ciao,</i> Ding. All right.

189
00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:34.189
Damn, girl.
Mm-mm-mm.

190
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.983
- I'd sure like to get in your pants.
- Really?

191
00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:39.235
Yeah. What size are these?

192
00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:43.072
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Bobby.

193
00:13:43.114 --> 00:13:45.200
Hey, baby.

194
00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:47.577
- How you doing?
- Good.

195
00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:49.829
You guys see all the reporters out there?

196
00:13:49.913 --> 00:13:52.874
Saying that girl Drew Decker
got killed last night.

197
00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:55.543
- You know what? I think I knew her.
- Really?

198
00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:58.171
- She had a brother named Steve?
- Yeah.

199
00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:00.882
Long hair, pretty little mouth,
perfect ass?

200
00:14:00.924 --> 00:14:03.885
- That was her.
- Nah, I was talking about Steve.

201
00:14:03.927 --> 00:14:05.929
Whatever happened to him?

202
00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:09.015
Do you guys think it's strange
that she got killed

203
00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:14.437
exactly one year after we,
you know, killed that guy?

204
00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:17.190
Hey! Cindy,
that was an accident.

205
00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:19.442
Was it, Greg?

206
00:14:23.154 --> 00:14:25.281
Yeah! Yeah!

207
00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:38.628
Would you look
at what they're doing?

208
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.464
When are we gonna do
stuff like that, huh?

209
00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:43.508
One day.

210
00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:46.135
- You like that, baby?
- Yeah, that's different.

211
00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:48.513
- You like that?
- Oh, I love that.

212
00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:51.099
Oh, I love when you play with my ass.

213
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.060
I'm not playing with your ass.

214
00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:57.480
- Ray!
- Oh, my bad.

215
00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:00.650
Come on, man!

216
00:15:00.692 --> 00:15:03.444
Hey, Bobby, put on some music.

217
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.614
Hold on.
Here, put this on.

218
00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:13.871
Yeah, that's the shit right here! Whoo!

219
00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:16.499
<i>It's raining men</i>

220
00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:17.875
Baby!

221
00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:23.339
What? It's a classic.

222
00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:27.385
Put on the radio, man.

223
00:15:30.013 --> 00:15:32.515
Yeah! Whoo!

224
00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:48.906
- What? It was laundry day.
- What the fuck is...?

225
00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:51.034
Yeah!

226
00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:53.703
Whoo!

227
00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:56.748
Yeah!

228
00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:57.874
Whoo!

229
00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:59.876
Hey, come over here.

230
00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:03.046
- What?
- Just get a little closer to me.

231
00:16:03.087 --> 00:16:05.798
Something you're gonna tell me?

232
00:16:06.883 --> 00:16:09.969
- Bobby, what are you doing?
- I just want you to touch it.

233
00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:13.014
- Uh...
- Just a little bit. Come on.

234
00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:13.097
Whoo!

235
00:16:13.098 --> 00:16:14.807
Whoo!

236
00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:21.731
- Ow!
- Oh, yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

237
00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:34.535
Oh, my God! Shit!

238
00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:37.330
God, Cindy...

239
00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:39.040
Oh, shit!

240
00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:52.595
- Oh, my God.
- What was that?

241
00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:55.098
I think we hit something.

242
00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:01.229
Oh, man!

243
00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:06.109
Bobby, look at my car, man!
My dad's gonna freak!

244
00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:08.736
I didn't see it.
It came out of nowhere.

245
00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:11.823
- Oh, my God, we hit a boot!
- Where's the foot?

246
00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:13.991
I don't know.

247
00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:16.160
Where the...?

248
00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:19.497
Agh, it's a body!

249
00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.624
- Oh, shit. Is he alive?
- I don't know.

250
00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:23.710
- Well, check it out!
- I can't.

251
00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:26.587
- Shit!
- We have to call the police.

252
00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:29.132
- No way. I ain't going to jail.
- We have to!

253
00:17:29.173 --> 00:17:32.427
Hey, Cindy, do you know
what they do to young boys in prison?

254
00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:36.431
All those sex-starved convicts
just waiting for a fresh piece of meat.

255
00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:40.268
- Maybe we should call the police.
- Yeah, that's a great idea.

256
00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:42.562
What about Brenda?
Think she wants to go to jail?

257
00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:45.231
This is manslaughter.
We're all gonna fry for this.

258
00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:48.568
- We're looking at 10 to 15 years.
- Shut up, Bobby!

259
00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:50.778
- Alcohol all over...
- I'm fine.

260
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.322
- We're in so much trouble.
- I'm fine.

261
00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:55.158
Don't blame it on me, Ray.

262
00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:59.287
- Look, we'll get rid of the body.
- Unnecessary.

263
00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:01.914
- We'll dump him in the ocean.
- No, the pier.

264
00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:04.292
- I'll be leaving now.
- Great idea.

265
00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:07.420
- What about the alcohol?
- We'll get rid of it.

266
00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:10.882
- Hurry up, let's go.
- Put him in the trunk.

267
00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:13.384
- I won't have anything to do with it!
- Shut up!

268
00:18:13.468 --> 00:18:17.013
Cindy, come on.
We'll just pretend it never happened.

269
00:18:17.054 --> 00:18:20.391
You know, like the time we got drunk
and we went down on each other.

270
00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:22.310
- I'll get his arm.
- I'll grab his other arm.

271
00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:24.187
I'll grab his ass.

272
00:18:24.228 --> 00:18:26.689
We'll take him to Williamson Cove
and dump him.

273
00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:29.650
The sharks'll take care
of the evidence.

274
00:18:29.692 --> 00:18:32.028
Oh, my God, someone's coming!

275
00:18:32.069 --> 00:18:35.156
- Oh, shit. It's Shorty.
- Brenda, take care of him.

276
00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:44.540
Shorty, I know you ain't driving
without no papers.

277
00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:47.585
I got papers, blunts, bongs -

278
00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:50.213
all the ingredients
to make a high-nigger pie.

279
00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:55.676
- Hey, yo, can I help you?
- Yo, what's up, Ray?

280
00:18:55.718 --> 00:18:58.429
- Yo, son, y'all need jumper cables?
- Nah, we're cool.

281
00:18:58.513 --> 00:19:01.724
Oh, good, cos I left
my roach clip at home.

282
00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:05.561
- Go home, Shorty.
- Yeah. I'll see you later.

283
00:19:06.437 --> 00:19:07.438
Peace, Ray.

284
00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:10.107
- Get the trunk closed.
- It won't close.

285
00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:12.860
I'll do it.

286
00:19:37.593 --> 00:19:40.388
Hold on, hold on.
Put him down - he's heavy.

287
00:19:40.429 --> 00:19:42.682
Oh, Jesus!

288
00:19:42.765 --> 00:19:46.394
OK, look. On three,
we dump him over the ledge.

289
00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:48.813
Wait. Shouldn't we
at least check his wallet?

290
00:19:48.896 --> 00:19:52.733
- For what?
- Shit, he might have some money.

291
00:19:52.775 --> 00:19:55.695
We already committed murder.
We might as well rob his ass.

292
00:19:55.778 --> 00:19:57.488
- Credit cards.
- Jewellery.

293
00:19:57.572 --> 00:20:00.408
I'm gonna take his drawers.

294
00:20:00.449 --> 00:20:03.703
Hey, yo, get off!
His drawers are mine! Yo!

295
00:20:04.912 --> 00:20:07.415
- I got me a gold ring.
- Credit cards.

296
00:20:07.456 --> 00:20:11.043
- All right, let's get him in the water.
- I don't think I can, Greg.

297
00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:13.588
- It's not too late.
- Shut up, OK?

298
00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:17.633
- Christ, already! I'll do it.
- Just get him in the water.

299
00:20:17.675 --> 00:20:20.803
OK? One, two,

300
00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:22.889
three.

301
00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:30.229
Right now we make a pact.
We take this to our grave.

302
00:20:30.313 --> 00:20:32.231
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

303
00:20:32.315 --> 00:20:34.275
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

304
00:20:34.317 --> 00:20:37.486
Say it, Cindy. Say it!

305
00:20:37.945 --> 00:20:40.656
"We take this to our grave" - say it!

306
00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.950
"We take this to our grave" - say it!

307
00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:47.330
- Greg, chill. You're hurting her.
- We take this to our grave.

308
00:20:47.371 --> 00:20:48.289
Ow!

309
00:20:48.331 --> 00:20:53.044
- And we never mention this again.
- Mention what?

310
00:20:53.127 --> 00:20:55.421
The guy we just killed!

311
00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:59.592
- Well, you just mentioned it, Greg.
- Starting now!

312
00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:03.846
- Stupid bitch, man.
- God, I hate him.

313
00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:07.224
It's gonna be OK, baby.
It's gonna be OK. I promise.

314
00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:10.561
Just touch it again.
Come on. Please?

315
00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:15.983
You have to move on, Cindy.
That's all behind us now.

316
00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:18.319
Exactly. It's a coincidence.

317
00:21:18.361 --> 00:21:22.281
Greg's right, Cindy. I mean,
What do you think we're in, a horror movie?

318
00:21:23.407 --> 00:21:26.035
Yeah, you guys are right.
If we were,

319
00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:30.873
they'd probably cast some dingbat
like Jennifer Love Huge Tits to play me.

320
00:21:30.957 --> 00:21:35.795
Yeah, or they'd cast people in
their late twenties, early thirties to play us.

321
00:21:37.672 --> 00:21:41.550
Kenny, get the camera ready.
Here, hold my gum.

322
00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:46.138
- Hi. Sheriff, can I get a statement?
- No comment.

323
00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:51.602
Damn! Who do I have to screw
around here to get a stupid story?

324
00:21:51.686 --> 00:21:53.896
Hey! Hey, no running!

325
00:21:56.107 --> 00:21:58.109
Loser.

326
00:21:58.192 --> 00:22:00.695
- Slow it down!
- Blow me!

327
00:22:01.696 --> 00:22:02.696
All right!

328
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:06.534
Hi. Gail Hailstorm -
field reporter, Hard Story.

329
00:22:06.575 --> 00:22:09.912
- Special Officer Doofy.
- Hi, Doofy.

330
00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:12.873
Doofy, listen.
Is there a problem on campus?

331
00:22:12.915 --> 00:22:15.209
- No comment. No comment.
- OK. OK.

332
00:22:15.751 --> 00:22:18.921
You know, you look awfully young
to be a police officer.

333
00:22:19.005 --> 00:22:21.257
- I'm 25 and a half years old.
- Ooh!

334
00:22:21.298 --> 00:22:23.509
- Yeah, that's this many.
- Ah, so big!

335
00:22:23.592 --> 00:22:25.594
Yeah. That's big.

336
00:22:25.636 --> 00:22:28.597
Well, you don't look a day over 12.

337
00:22:28.681 --> 00:22:32.643
Except for the big head
and glazed-over look in your eyes.

338
00:22:32.727 --> 00:22:36.313
- Ooh, was that drool?
- Yeah. I forgot to swallow.

339
00:22:36.397 --> 00:22:38.858
Don't worry, cos I never forget.

340
00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.363
- Remind me not to do that again.
- Sorry.

341
00:22:44.447 --> 00:22:49.744
Due to the recent tragedy,
we will be questioning all students.

342
00:22:49.785 --> 00:22:52.621
Sounds like we've got
a serial killer on our hands.

343
00:22:52.705 --> 00:22:55.833
I'm not supposed to say.
It's official police business.

344
00:22:55.916 --> 00:22:59.920
Hey, Doofy, what do you say
you and I go inside my van over there

345
00:22:59.962 --> 00:23:03.299
and get to know each other a little better?
Would you like that?

346
00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.594
- That van?
- Yeah, that van right there.

347
00:23:08.137 --> 00:23:11.223
Yeah. Yeah, OK, let's go.

348
00:23:11.307 --> 00:23:12.767
Come on.

349
00:23:12.808 --> 00:23:16.562
A terrible tragedy
and an unbearable loss.

350
00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:20.900
It's days like today
that we need prayer in school.

351
00:23:20.983 --> 00:23:26.322
It starts to unravel
the very moral fabric of our society.

352
00:23:26.363 --> 00:23:28.407
Here you go, baby.

353
00:23:28.491 --> 00:23:30.493
Go to your daddy.

354
00:23:31.619 --> 00:23:32.995
Oh!

355
00:23:34.371 --> 00:23:36.123
I'll see you after class.

356
00:23:36.165 --> 00:23:37.666
- Sweet!
- All right!

357
00:23:37.708 --> 00:23:42.171
OK, class, who would like to give
their oral presentation first?

358
00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:45.091
- Oh!
- Anybody?

359
00:23:45.174 --> 00:23:48.219
- Yes!
- Anybody else?

360
00:23:50.012 --> 00:23:51.055
OK, Heather.

361
00:23:51.931 --> 00:23:53.265
Yes!

362
00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.187
- OK. Can I start?
- Yeah.

363
00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:01.232
OK, my presentation
is on the First Amendment,

364
00:24:01.315 --> 00:24:05.861
and it began on May 25th, 1787,
in Philly with George Washington,

365
00:24:05.903 --> 00:24:07.655
and it states, and I quote:

366
00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:11.408
"When our Founding Fathers
argued the passage of our glorious..."

367
00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:04.628
The First Amendment gives us the right
to say what we want...

368
00:25:04.712 --> 00:25:07.673
Oh, shut the fuck up!

369
00:25:07.756 --> 00:25:11.093
So, who's next?

370
00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.804
Uh, Cindy Campbell.

371
00:25:13.888 --> 00:25:17.600
Isn't she the daughter of...?
Well, you know...

372
00:25:17.683 --> 00:25:21.228
- Oh, yeah, you know, Mrs...
- Mrs...

373
00:25:22.146 --> 00:25:24.148
Yeah, the one and only...

374
00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:26.108
The one and only.

375
00:25:27.735 --> 00:25:31.405
- Why, hello, Cindy.
- Hi, Principal Squiggman.

376
00:25:31.447 --> 00:25:35.743
- Thanks, Doofy.
- It's Special Officer Doofy today, Cind.

377
00:25:36.535 --> 00:25:40.206
Now, the sheriff has some questions
that he would like to ask you today.

378
00:25:40.289 --> 00:25:43.792
- What is that... that god-awful smell?
- I don't know.

379
00:25:43.876 --> 00:25:46.295
I go poopie.

380
00:25:46.378 --> 00:25:49.298
Did you just say that you, uh...
you went poopie?

381
00:25:49.381 --> 00:25:52.468
- Yeah. It was good.
- Mm.

382
00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:54.887
- Get him out of here.
- Yes.

383
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.474
- Thank you, Doofy.
- OK.

384
00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:00.851
You should now go back
to Special Ed.

385
00:26:00.935 --> 00:26:04.605
- OK. Salute.
- Maybe a change of underwear, son.

386
00:26:05.147 --> 00:26:07.900
- Bye, Doofy.
- Bye, Cind.

387
00:26:08.734 --> 00:26:10.736
- How are you, Cindy?
- Fine.

388
00:26:10.819 --> 00:26:13.739
- How are you, Sheriff?
- Bloated, constipated.

389
00:26:13.822 --> 00:26:17.409
Got a boil on my ass the size of a walnut.
You know, the usual.

390
00:26:17.493 --> 00:26:21.789
Cindy, I want to ask you
some questions about Drew Decker.

391
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:24.959
- I didn't really know her.
- Come on, sure you did.

392
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.419
No. I mean,
I didn't really know her.

393
00:26:27.503 --> 00:26:32.675
I've been in this game a long time. Don't
bullshit a bullshitter. Tell me about Drew.

394
00:26:32.716 --> 00:26:34.843
What was she like in bed, Cindy?

395
00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:38.639
Ha! Tried to get you.

396
00:26:38.681 --> 00:26:42.768
It's an old police trick.
You didn't fall for it. Good for you, kid.

397
00:26:42.851 --> 00:26:44.687
Hike!

398
00:26:45.688 --> 00:26:47.314
Pass! Pass!

399
00:26:51.527 --> 00:26:53.070
All right, shower up!

400
00:26:53.153 --> 00:26:55.114
Yes!

401
00:26:55.197 --> 00:26:58.701
Yo, Dugan, man.
Nice play, yo. Word up.

402
00:26:58.742 --> 00:27:01.578
Johnson! What a block, baby. Word up.

403
00:27:01.662 --> 00:27:03.872
Woodward! Nice ass.

404
00:27:04.957 --> 00:27:07.126
Damn!

405
00:27:07.209 --> 00:27:10.671
Yo, Greg, what's up?
You gonna hit the showers or what?

406
00:27:10.713 --> 00:27:14.508
No, man. I think I'm gonna work out,
beat the bag a little.

407
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:16.635
Suit yourself, kid.
All right!

408
00:27:16.719 --> 00:27:20.389
Last one in the shower's a rotten egg!
Come on, y'all.

409
00:27:20.472 --> 00:27:23.058
I'm gonna get y'all.

410
00:27:23.142 --> 00:27:26.186
Don't let Uncle Ray catch you!

411
00:27:49.293 --> 00:27:51.628
Who did this? Huh?

412
00:27:51.712 --> 00:27:53.756
Where are you?

413
00:27:53.839 --> 00:27:56.175
This isn't funny, all right?

414
00:27:56.258 --> 00:27:59.219
A small dick's like a disability, man!

415
00:27:59.261 --> 00:28:03.432
Would you make fun of a guy
in a wheelchair? Huh? Would you?

416
00:28:03.474 --> 00:28:05.851
Come on out here, you sick fuck!

417
00:28:05.934 --> 00:28:08.896
I'll kick the shit out of you right now!

418
00:28:08.937 --> 00:28:10.356
All right?

419
00:28:10.439 --> 00:28:14.151
It's not the size of the hammer,
it's the nail you're throwing it at!

420
00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:20.783
It's a shame how she died.
She was such a nice girl.

421
00:28:20.824 --> 00:28:25.120
She used to baby-sit my brother Doofy.
He had the biggest crush on her.

422
00:28:25.788 --> 00:28:27.581
Ray, you're a dead man!

423
00:28:27.623 --> 00:28:32.169
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Chill out.
- You wanna get butt-naked and wrestle?

424
00:28:32.252 --> 00:28:35.297
- Bring it on, Ray!
- Hold my earrings. Where's my Vaseline?

425
00:28:35.339 --> 00:28:39.301
- Take it easy. What's the problem?
- I'll show you the problem.

426
00:28:39.385 --> 00:28:41.512
Oh, wow! That's you?

427
00:28:41.929 --> 00:28:46.392
They... they turned the hot water off
in the showers, all right?

428
00:28:49.478 --> 00:28:52.689
Laugh it up, you guys.
Big laugh.

429
00:28:54.233 --> 00:28:56.652
You know what?
You can all go to hell!

430
00:28:56.693 --> 00:29:00.197
Greg, you're not the only one
who got one.

431
00:29:01.407 --> 00:29:03.659
You mean
Bobby's got a baby dick, too?

432
00:29:06.161 --> 00:29:09.039
No, I was talking about the note.

433
00:29:09.123 --> 00:29:11.166
I got one, too.

434
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:14.086
- Somebody knows.
- That's bullshit, Cindy.

435
00:29:14.169 --> 00:29:16.213
Someone's just trying
to fuck with us.

436
00:29:16.296 --> 00:29:18.632
We have to call the police, Greg.

437
00:29:18.674 --> 00:29:21.802
You call the police,
and I'll kill you myself.

438
00:29:29.017 --> 00:29:33.272
- You're hurting her, man.
- You know what? That goes for all of you.

439
00:29:33.355 --> 00:29:36.108
That psycho wants a piece of me,
bring it on!

440
00:29:36.191 --> 00:29:39.069
But I'm not going to jail.
You got that?

441
00:29:47.411 --> 00:29:49.621
What's everybody talking about?

442
00:29:49.705 --> 00:29:53.542
Just forget it, Shorty.
You already know too much.

443
00:29:56.545 --> 00:29:58.964
Aren't they beautiful?

444
00:29:59.047 --> 00:30:02.050
- Buffy!
- Contestant number one!

445
00:30:05.179 --> 00:30:08.390
Very good.
And contestant number two.

446
00:30:12.686 --> 00:30:15.689
Very good.
And contestant number three.

447
00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:19.109
Buffy! That's my girl!

448
00:30:19.193 --> 00:30:22.488
- That's my girlfriend!
- Yeah, that's my girlfriend too!

449
00:30:22.571 --> 00:30:25.866
- Hey, kiss my ass!
- Yeah, I'm hitting that too!

450
00:30:25.908 --> 00:30:28.744
- All right, Buffy!
- Hey, shut the hell up, man!

451
00:30:28.785 --> 00:30:32.414
- Yeah, best pussy I ever had!
- What, you want a piece of me?

452
00:30:32.498 --> 00:30:34.750
Now the talent portion
of the competition.

453
00:30:34.791 --> 00:30:38.420
Oh, you guys, I'm gonna go downstairs
for a closer seat. See you after the show.

454
00:30:38.504 --> 00:30:42.341
Number three, Buffy Gilmore.

455
00:30:42.424 --> 00:30:44.801
I'm gonna hit the head.
Want anything?

456
00:30:44.885 --> 00:30:47.596
No, I'm good, man.
But hurry, she's gonna perform.

457
00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:49.389
Don't worry, I'll be back.

458
00:30:49.431 --> 00:30:52.643
Good evening, Buffy.
And what will be your talent this evening?

459
00:30:52.726 --> 00:30:56.772
Acting. I'll be doing
a dramatic reading.

460
00:30:56.855 --> 00:30:58.690
Hear, hear!

461
00:30:58.774 --> 00:31:01.026
Buffy Gilmore,
doing a dramatic reading.

462
00:31:02.778 --> 00:31:06.406
Hey, do that thing from <i>Baywatch.</i>
She's running down the beach...

463
00:31:13.247 --> 00:31:15.332
Look out, Greg!
Look behind you!

464
00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:18.794
It's him! It's the killer!

465
00:31:18.835 --> 00:31:19.711
Huh?

466
00:31:19.795 --> 00:31:22.756
Oh, my God!
Somebody do something!

467
00:31:22.798 --> 00:31:26.301
Somebody do something!

468
00:31:26.385 --> 00:31:28.595
He's killing him!

469
00:31:28.637 --> 00:31:31.515
- He's killing him!
- Must be an original piece.

470
00:31:31.598 --> 00:31:33.517
He's killing him!

471
00:31:35.394 --> 00:31:37.187
She's good. She's good.

472
00:31:37.271 --> 00:31:40.148
- What's wrong with you people?
- That's fantastic.

473
00:31:40.232 --> 00:31:43.610
You fucking bastards!
Why won't anyone help?

474
00:31:43.652 --> 00:31:46.530
- Amazing.
- She's the next Pamela Lee.

475
00:31:46.613 --> 00:31:49.616
Oh, God...
Oh, God! No!

476
00:31:50.576 --> 00:31:52.869
Greg, don't die!

477
00:31:54.788 --> 00:31:57.291
Give it up for Buffy Gilmore!
Wonderful!

478
00:31:57.332 --> 00:31:59.501
Absolutely fantastic!

479
00:32:02.629 --> 00:32:06.508
I think we have a winner, ladies
and gentlemen. Miss Buffy Gilmore!

480
00:32:06.592 --> 00:32:09.386
Buffy, wait!
You have to go back on stage.

481
00:32:09.469 --> 00:32:12.514
- I have to get to Greg.
- You won! They're calling your name.

482
00:32:12.556 --> 00:32:16.018
There's a killer... I won?

483
00:32:16.101 --> 00:32:19.062
- They're calling your name. Go.
- What about Greg?

484
00:32:19.146 --> 00:32:21.273
- Fuck Greg! I won!
- Congratulations!

485
00:32:21.356 --> 00:32:23.233
Out of my way, loser!

486
00:32:23.317 --> 00:32:25.944
Miss Buffy Gilmore!

487
00:32:32.826 --> 00:32:35.120
Give me my crown, bitch.

488
00:32:50.093 --> 00:32:51.928
Agh!

489
00:32:52.929 --> 00:32:56.558
- There's no sign of him anywhere.
- He could've taken the body.

490
00:32:56.642 --> 00:32:59.603
That's impossible.
There's no blood, nothing. Look around.

491
00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:02.564
I bet it's just Greg
playing one of his dumb jokes.

492
00:33:02.606 --> 00:33:07.736
He'll turn up, I'm sure of it. He's probably
at my house waiting for us right now.

493
00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:12.616
All right. But I'm gonna look around some
more, so you mind riding home with Buffy?

494
00:33:12.699 --> 00:33:14.743
- Yeah, no problem.
- All right, fine.

495
00:33:14.785 --> 00:33:16.328
Call me later.

496
00:33:37.808 --> 00:33:40.769
- Hello.
- Hello, Cindy.

497
00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:43.563
- Who is this?
- It's me, Bobby.

498
00:33:43.605 --> 00:33:46.108
You know, your boyfriend.

499
00:33:46.191 --> 00:33:50.153
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I guess I'm a little jumpy lately.

500
00:33:50.237 --> 00:33:53.699
- Hey, any sign of Greg?
- No.

501
00:33:53.782 --> 00:33:56.201
- Do you want me to come by?
- No.

502
00:33:57.077 --> 00:34:00.414
I'm just gonna take a bath
and then I'm gonna go to bed.

503
00:34:00.455 --> 00:34:04.251
OK. I'd really like to see you, but...
I love you.

504
00:34:04.292 --> 00:34:05.627
Aw...

505
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:08.130
I love you too, baby.

506
00:34:30.402 --> 00:34:32.070
Bobby, I told you...

507
00:34:32.154 --> 00:34:34.656
I still know what you did last Halloween.

508
00:34:34.698 --> 00:34:36.575
Who is this?

509
00:34:49.337 --> 00:34:51.047
Ow! Ow!

510
00:34:56.386 --> 00:34:58.805
- Hello.
- I'm gonna kill you.

511
00:34:58.847 --> 00:35:01.016
- I'm gonna slice you up.
- Who is this?

512
00:35:01.099 --> 00:35:03.727
- I'm gonna chop you like liver.
- What do you want?

513
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:06.271
I'm in the house.

514
00:35:06.897 --> 00:35:09.149
Do you know where I am?

515
00:35:11.276 --> 00:35:12.861
I could be anywhere.

516
00:35:12.903 --> 00:35:15.363
I'm like the wind, baby.

517
00:35:15.405 --> 00:35:16.948
Yeah...

518
00:35:17.032 --> 00:35:18.366
Where am I?

519
00:35:20.869 --> 00:35:21.745
Um...

520
00:35:21.828 --> 00:35:23.705
You're... you're behind the couch.

521
00:35:25.665 --> 00:35:27.417
What? How do you know that?

522
00:35:27.501 --> 00:35:29.419
I can see your feet.

523
00:35:31.046 --> 00:35:33.048
Ach...

524
00:35:33.089 --> 00:35:34.758
OK, turn around.

525
00:35:34.841 --> 00:35:37.427
Close your eyes. No peeking.

526
00:35:41.681 --> 00:35:44.142
Yeah. No. No, no.

527
00:35:45.811 --> 00:35:48.730
Hey, no peeking. Turn around.

528
00:35:48.814 --> 00:35:50.482
Good.

529
00:35:50.565 --> 00:35:52.692
OK, now you can look.

530
00:35:52.734 --> 00:35:55.612
Now do you know where I am?
You don't.

531
00:35:56.446 --> 00:35:59.741
No, Mr Killer,
I don't know where you are.

532
00:35:59.825 --> 00:36:02.077
I'll give you a big clue.

533
00:36:05.789 --> 00:36:08.083
Oh! I gotta stop drinking.

534
00:36:15.006 --> 00:36:16.925
- Grandma!
- Hi, baby.

535
00:36:16.967 --> 00:36:19.427
Oh, my hip!

536
00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:52.335
White woman in trouble off the 744...

537
00:36:59.259 --> 00:37:02.304
Are you OK? I heard screaming.
What's going on?

538
00:37:02.387 --> 00:37:04.764
- Bobby! He was here!
- Shh...

539
00:37:04.806 --> 00:37:08.310
- The killer was here, Bobby.
- It's OK.

540
00:37:15.233 --> 00:37:18.320
- I can explain that.
- Oh, my God...

541
00:37:19.112 --> 00:37:22.032
A friend gave 'em to me.
Cindy... Cindy...

542
00:37:22.824 --> 00:37:24.409
Cindy! Cindy!

543
00:37:24.492 --> 00:37:27.495
Cindy! Cindy! Cindy!

544
00:37:32.042 --> 00:37:34.336
It's me, Cind. Ugh!

545
00:37:34.419 --> 00:37:37.130
Cindy, you know me! Cindy!

546
00:37:43.428 --> 00:37:46.222
I know you've had a rough night,
so I won't keep you.

547
00:37:46.306 --> 00:37:50.518
I just want you to look at some photos,
tell me what you think.

548
00:37:55.523 --> 00:37:57.359
Uh-uh.

549
00:37:59.194 --> 00:38:01.237
- No?
- No.

550
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.492
- I'm sorry, Sheriff.
- You're sure?

551
00:38:06.326 --> 00:38:09.412
OK, you're free to go.
Do you have somebody picking you up?

552
00:38:09.496 --> 00:38:11.873
- Yeah.
- Oh, just...

553
00:38:12.874 --> 00:38:15.168
Just check that one out again.

554
00:38:16.378 --> 00:38:20.799
- Mm, no.
- No? Well, worth a shot. All right, thanks.

555
00:38:21.633 --> 00:38:24.386
- Guess what I just did with those hookers.
- No way.

556
00:38:24.469 --> 00:38:27.514
All the way, man! Yes, yes.
Watch this. Doofy!

557
00:38:27.555 --> 00:38:29.849
- Yeah?
- Come on. Come on.

558
00:38:29.891 --> 00:38:31.476
OK.

559
00:38:32.268 --> 00:38:34.437
Special Officer Doofy reporting.

560
00:38:34.521 --> 00:38:37.065
Hey, Doofy, smell my fingers.

561
00:38:37.983 --> 00:38:39.401
What's that?

562
00:38:39.484 --> 00:38:42.737
That's when you know
you've become a man, Doofy!

563
00:38:42.821 --> 00:38:44.906
Hey, Terry, smell my finger.

564
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:47.701
- Ugh! What the hell is that?
- My ass.

565
00:38:47.742 --> 00:38:51.663
- Get the hell out of here, Doofy.
- Doofy, Mom said get home now.

566
00:38:52.247 --> 00:38:54.749
Tell Mom I'm on official police business.

567
00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:58.586
- Cindy, are you OK?
- Hey, hey, hey. No talking to the witness.

568
00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:01.589
- Go get in the car. She's coming with us.
- Does Mom know?

569
00:39:01.631 --> 00:39:02.924
Yeah, Doofus.

570
00:39:03.008 --> 00:39:06.761
Mom says when I wear this badge
you should treat me like a man of the law.

571
00:39:06.845 --> 00:39:10.265
Mom also said for you to stop
sticking your dick in the vacuum cleaner.

572
00:39:13.768 --> 00:39:15.603
OK, three, two...

573
00:39:15.645 --> 00:39:18.064
- Oh, no... Gosh damn...
- What now?

574
00:39:18.106 --> 00:39:20.442
- There's all these numbers...
- Can't you count?

575
00:39:20.525 --> 00:39:23.778
- I can count, but...
- Let me make it easy for you. Listen up.

576
00:39:23.862 --> 00:39:27.198
This little piggy went to market.
This little piggy stayed home.

577
00:39:27.282 --> 00:39:30.285
Now, if this little piggy
doesn't roll the goddamn camera...

578
00:39:30.368 --> 00:39:31.703
We're live, Gail.

579
00:39:31.786 --> 00:39:36.624
Gail Hailstorm at the police station, where
I'll try to get a glimpse of Cindy Campbell,

580
00:39:36.708 --> 00:39:39.419
the young girl
who was attacked earlier this evening...

581
00:39:39.461 --> 00:39:43.673
- You're on my foot, fat shit! What'd I say?
- "Don't ever step on Gail's shoes."

582
00:39:43.757 --> 00:39:45.800
- Why not?
- Cos Gail wears Prada shoes.

583
00:39:45.884 --> 00:39:48.136
- You idiot.
- I'm a bad man.

584
00:39:48.178 --> 00:39:50.930
Cindy! Cindy, can we get a statement?

585
00:39:50.972 --> 00:39:53.308
Buffy Gilmore, Miss Teen.
She's not talking.

586
00:39:53.391 --> 00:39:55.727
Is it true the police
have someone in custody?

587
00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:59.105
- Come on, Cindy.
- Cindy, your ass looks fat!

588
00:40:00.815 --> 00:40:02.650
Bitch!

589
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:05.320
- Nice shot!
- Come on.

590
00:40:05.403 --> 00:40:08.364
- All right, who copped a feel?
- Gail, it was me.

591
00:40:08.448 --> 00:40:11.493
- Oh, my God.
- It was an accident, Gail.

592
00:40:11.576 --> 00:40:14.454
I only touched the top of the breast.

593
00:40:14.496 --> 00:40:16.664
- It was so tender and juicy...
- Shut up!

594
00:40:25.632 --> 00:40:29.260
- Yo.
- Hello, Shorty. What are you doing?

595
00:40:29.344 --> 00:40:35.100
Nothin'. Sittin' here watchin' the game,
smokin' some bud.

596
00:40:36.017 --> 00:40:38.103
Are you all alone?

597
00:40:38.186 --> 00:40:41.481
- Wassup!
- Wassup!

598
00:40:41.731 --> 00:40:44.359
What the...? Who's that?

599
00:40:44.442 --> 00:40:47.320
Yo, pick up the phone.

600
00:40:47.362 --> 00:40:50.448
- Wassup!
- Wassup!

601
00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:56.496
Yo, Dookie, pick up the phone!

602
00:40:56.538 --> 00:40:58.581
- Yo.
- Wassup!

603
00:41:07.423 --> 00:41:13.054
- What you doin', son?
- Nothin'... Just chillin'... killin'...

604
00:41:13.138 --> 00:41:15.807
True. True.

605
00:41:16.474 --> 00:41:19.102
So you think Bobby did it?

606
00:41:21.229 --> 00:41:24.524
I don't know.
But he was there, Buffy.

607
00:41:24.566 --> 00:41:28.570
I knew there had to be something.
He's just too perfect.

608
00:41:28.653 --> 00:41:32.115
Handsome, smart, good in bed...

609
00:41:33.074 --> 00:41:35.869
- What did you say?
- Uh...

610
00:41:36.578 --> 00:41:39.706
Hey, Cind.
Got you an ice pack for your hand.

611
00:41:39.873 --> 00:41:41.040
Ow!

612
00:41:41.082 --> 00:41:42.542
Sorry.

613
00:41:43.001 --> 00:41:45.211
I'll get you one for your head.

614
00:41:45.253 --> 00:41:47.630
No, no, that's OK, Doofy.

615
00:41:47.714 --> 00:41:52.260
Hey, we're gonna get that guy
you dumped in the water. Yeah.

616
00:41:52.302 --> 00:41:55.013
I'll be next door if you need me.

617
00:41:55.096 --> 00:41:57.098
Night, Cind.

618
00:41:57.891 --> 00:41:59.350
Buffy, you told him?

619
00:41:59.434 --> 00:42:02.520
The moron overheard a conversation
Greg and I were having.

620
00:42:02.604 --> 00:42:07.859
- Yeah, but what if he says something?
- Who'd believe a retarded retard like him?

621
00:42:08.443 --> 00:42:10.403
Cindy, telephone.

622
00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.365
Thank you.

623
00:42:14.449 --> 00:42:15.783
Hello?

624
00:42:15.825 --> 00:42:18.286
Hello, Cindy.

625
00:42:18.328 --> 00:42:20.288
- Guess what.
- No!

626
00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:22.624
- You got the wrong guy.
- No!

627
00:42:22.665 --> 00:42:24.459
- Doofy!
- It's not Bobby.

628
00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:27.170
Who is this?

629
00:42:27.253 --> 00:42:30.131
- Doofy!
- Oh, my God...

630
00:42:36.471 --> 00:42:38.389
Hello?

631
00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:41.142
Hello?

632
00:42:41.809 --> 00:42:46.147
I said don't disturb me
when I'm cleaning my room!

633
00:42:51.611 --> 00:42:54.155
I heard Bobby got out this morning.

634
00:42:54.239 --> 00:42:57.492
I haven't seen him around.
Is he pissed?

635
00:42:57.575 --> 00:43:01.496
You mean since you branded him
the Candy Man? No. His heart is broken.

636
00:43:01.537 --> 00:43:04.540
Yo, son. It's like I seen this all before.

637
00:43:04.624 --> 00:43:08.503
- They had a killer at your old high school?
- No, it was in this movie Scream.

638
00:43:08.586 --> 00:43:12.423
- Same dialogue and everything. This is ill.
- How did it end?

639
00:43:12.507 --> 00:43:16.844
I don't know. Some niggas started shooting
up in the movie theatre, so we broke out.

640
00:43:16.928 --> 00:43:20.390
- No doubt.
- OK, I say we all just stick together.

641
00:43:20.473 --> 00:43:22.600
Tonight everyone meet at my house.

642
00:43:22.684 --> 00:43:26.187
And bring some friends.
But don't tell everyone. Keep it quiet.

643
00:43:26.229 --> 00:43:27.605
OK.

644
00:43:27.689 --> 00:43:32.860
Yo! Party at Cindy's house!
Drunk white women for everybody!

645
00:43:34.654 --> 00:43:39.075
Ray, if you see Bobby,
tell him I love him.

646
00:43:39.701 --> 00:43:43.705
OK. If I see Bobby,
I'll tell him I love him.

647
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:54.257
- Jesus!
- It's OK. It's all right. It's just me, baby.

648
00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:58.136
- You don't still think it's me, do you?
- No. But somebody did try to kill me.

649
00:43:58.219 --> 00:44:02.640
- And the police said I scared him away.
- I know. He called me last night.

650
00:44:02.724 --> 00:44:06.561
So it couldn't have been me.
I was in jail last night, remember?

651
00:44:08.646 --> 00:44:10.648
You're the best.

652
00:44:10.732 --> 00:44:13.192
I'm sorry. Please understand.

653
00:44:13.234 --> 00:44:16.112
What, that you'd rather
call me a killer than touch me?

654
00:44:16.195 --> 00:44:17.780
- That's not true.
- Then what is it?

655
00:44:17.864 --> 00:44:20.658
What is it?
She's gone and she's not coming back!

656
00:44:20.742 --> 00:44:22.493
It's been over a year, Cindy.

657
00:44:22.577 --> 00:44:25.580
But Ginger was such an important part
of the Spice Girls.

658
00:44:25.621 --> 00:44:28.333
You gotta move on, baby.

659
00:44:28.416 --> 00:44:31.210
I'm sorry if my complicated life

660
00:44:31.252 --> 00:44:35.089
is an inconvenience
to your perfect existence.

661
00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:36.549
Cindy...

662
00:44:36.924 --> 00:44:38.468
Cind...

663
00:44:38.551 --> 00:44:40.636
OK, everybody, listen up.

664
00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:45.892
Let me just say, uh, the killing
of these teenagers has been tragic,

665
00:44:45.933 --> 00:44:49.354
but, uh... hey, you know, shit happens.

666
00:44:49.437 --> 00:44:52.106
Sheriff? Sheriff?

667
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:54.317
- Sheriff?
- Yes, Miss Thunderstorm.

668
00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.278
- Have they found Cindy's father?
- No.

669
00:44:57.362 --> 00:45:00.740
- Isn't he a suspect?
- That's classified. Where did you get that?

670
00:45:00.782 --> 00:45:04.577
I'm sorry, but my sources
are strictly confidential, Sheriff.

671
00:45:04.619 --> 00:45:06.788
Hey, Gail.

672
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:09.332
Gail swallows.

673
00:45:16.297 --> 00:45:18.299
Watch this.

674
00:45:18.966 --> 00:45:21.010
Hello?

675
00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:23.221
Who is this?

676
00:45:23.304 --> 00:45:26.391
What? You wanna kill me?

677
00:45:26.933 --> 00:45:29.394
Oh, God... Hold on.

678
00:45:29.477 --> 00:45:31.020
Cindy, it's for you.

679
00:45:35.733 --> 00:45:37.860
All right, knock it off, Buffy.

680
00:45:37.944 --> 00:45:40.780
As you'll all have heard,
there is a killer in town

681
00:45:40.822 --> 00:45:44.492
and the police have asked us
to give you the following safety tips.

682
00:45:44.534 --> 00:45:46.661
Stay in well-lit areas.

683
00:45:46.744 --> 00:45:49.330
Do not travel alone whenever possible.

684
00:45:49.372 --> 00:45:51.207
Always wipe front to back.

685
00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:54.293
And remember,
never, ever believe someone

686
00:45:54.335 --> 00:46:00.341
when they tell you that shaving your
pubic hair will rid you of crab infestation.

687
00:46:00.383 --> 00:46:04.303
Now, I understand this is a difficult time
for you young ladies.

688
00:46:04.804 --> 00:46:10.184
So if anyone needs to come to my office
to talk, I am here for you.

689
00:46:13.813 --> 00:46:18.151
- What a crock of shit.
- It's not, Buffy! He's real!

690
00:46:29.203 --> 00:46:30.913
Miss Mann?

691
00:46:32.748 --> 00:46:36.252
Come in, dear. Have a seat.
Take off your bra if you'd like.

692
00:46:38.045 --> 00:46:40.047
No, thanks.

693
00:46:40.965 --> 00:46:43.009
What can I do for you, Cindy?

694
00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:44.886
I need to talk.

695
00:46:44.927 --> 00:46:49.682
See, I have this problem
and I don't know who to tell.

696
00:46:50.558 --> 00:46:53.728
- Not feeling so fresh?
- Huh?

697
00:46:53.811 --> 00:46:56.272
Feminine odour and itching
got you down?

698
00:46:56.355 --> 00:46:59.442
Uh, no. No, not that.

699
00:46:59.525 --> 00:47:01.569
Then what is it?

700
00:47:03.613 --> 00:47:06.115
I have a terrible secret.

701
00:47:06.199 --> 00:47:09.202
Well, Cindy, we all have our little secrets.

702
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:14.624
Sometimes we do things
we're not so proud of.

703
00:47:15.291 --> 00:47:17.710
Some for money,

704
00:47:17.752 --> 00:47:20.796
others to gain the athletic edge
on the competition.

705
00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.549
Sometimes those secrets
come back to haunt us.

706
00:47:23.591 --> 00:47:24.759
Agh!

707
00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:29.096
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yes, I do, Miss Mann.

708
00:47:29.138 --> 00:47:31.974
Thanks for ball... I mean all your help.

709
00:47:32.058 --> 00:47:34.268
I have to go to class.

710
00:47:35.394 --> 00:47:37.605
Any time, dear.

711
00:47:39.774 --> 00:47:43.819
- Buffy, are you coming?
- I'll catch up with you guys in a sec.

712
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:51.619
Redrum.

713
00:47:52.119 --> 00:47:54.080
Hello?

714
00:48:01.087 --> 00:48:03.297
Is somebody there?

715
00:48:04.423 --> 00:48:06.425
Hello?

716
00:48:09.387 --> 00:48:10.805
Agh!

717
00:48:12.515 --> 00:48:15.768
Very funny.
Who put you up to this? Cindy?

718
00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:18.896
Lose the cape - it's way too '903 horror.

719
00:48:20.815 --> 00:48:24.986
Oh, so what movie is this from?
<i>Die, Cheerleader, Die?</i>

720
00:48:27.071 --> 00:48:31.993
Wanna play psycho killer?
Can I be the helpless cheerleader?

721
00:48:33.786 --> 00:48:37.373
Oh, so is this where
I'm supposed to beg for my life?

722
00:48:37.456 --> 00:48:39.917
Please, Mr Killer, don't kill me.

723
00:48:44.297 --> 00:48:47.174
So is this where I'm supposed to bleed?

724
00:48:47.216 --> 00:48:49.760
Oh, look, I'm bleeding!

725
00:48:49.844 --> 00:48:51.929
Eek! Eek!

726
00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.641
Oh, yeah, I'm supposed to run, right?

727
00:48:55.683 --> 00:49:00.396
OK. I'm running!
I'm running! Help!

728
00:49:00.896 --> 00:49:05.443
Help! Now I'm gonna fall
and break my leg, leaving me helpless.

729
00:49:05.943 --> 00:49:07.528
Agh!

730
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:12.867
There you go, Mr Scary Killer.
I'm panicking now.

731
00:49:12.908 --> 00:49:16.996
Oh, God!
Somebody please help me!

732
00:49:17.038 --> 00:49:19.081
Oh, God, no!

733
00:49:19.874 --> 00:49:21.876
No!

734
00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:24.462
Oh, now what?

735
00:49:24.545 --> 00:49:29.216
I guess this is the big climax.
Hope you don't mind if I fake it.

736
00:49:29.258 --> 00:49:31.761
Aaaaghhhh!

737
00:49:33.554 --> 00:49:37.558
Oh, look at me. I'm all dead.
I'm a gross, scary severed head.

738
00:49:37.642 --> 00:49:39.226
Come on. Please!

739
00:49:39.268 --> 00:49:43.272
Do you know who I am? I'm Miss Teen.
You're really giving me a headache.

740
00:49:43.356 --> 00:49:47.193
And you got blood on my Gucci sweater.
I hope you're gonna pay for that.

741
00:49:47.234 --> 00:49:50.112
Agh! I will not be ignored
by the likes...

742
00:49:50.571 --> 00:49:50.654
I'm gonna jump!

743
00:49:50.655 --> 00:49:52.865
I'm gonna jump!

744
00:49:52.907 --> 00:49:55.576
- Phil, get back in there.
- No!

745
00:49:55.618 --> 00:49:58.245
- What are you doing up there?
- Be reasonable.

746
00:49:58.287 --> 00:50:03.834
I can't take this fucking job or those
greasy shithead teenagers any more!

747
00:50:03.918 --> 00:50:09.465
- I'm gonna end it all!
- Wait! Hold on! We're getting help for you!

748
00:50:09.548 --> 00:50:11.842
We know Bobby's not the killer.
So who is?

749
00:50:11.926 --> 00:50:13.260
I don't know.

750
00:50:13.302 --> 00:50:16.472
If the killer was in your house,
why didn't he kill you then?

751
00:50:16.555 --> 00:50:18.432
Because he's just messing with us.

752
00:50:18.516 --> 00:50:21.018
Don't you see?
He's got us right where he wants us.

753
00:50:21.102 --> 00:50:26.315
We can't go to the police. He's just
out there watching us and waiting for us.

754
00:50:26.399 --> 00:50:28.651
What are you waiting for, huh?

755
00:50:29.777 --> 00:50:32.196
What are you waiting for?

756
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:34.615
What are you waiting for?

757
00:50:35.491 --> 00:50:38.994
What am I waiting for?
What am I waiting for?

758
00:50:39.078 --> 00:50:42.123
- What are you waiting for?
- Fuck you!

759
00:50:44.417 --> 00:50:46.836
Oh, my God!

760
00:50:46.919 --> 00:50:49.839
Ray, I still don't think
this party is a good idea.

761
00:50:49.922 --> 00:50:53.426
- I won't let nothin' happen to you.
- I just don't feel right.

762
00:50:53.467 --> 00:50:57.930
- Why can't we just do something else?
- OK, how about we go to the movies?

763
00:50:57.972 --> 00:51:01.142
Huh? You like that?
See a little movie, huh?

764
00:51:04.061 --> 00:51:09.775
Hey! That is my song! You know they
gave me a shout-out on the album, right?

765
00:51:09.817 --> 00:51:11.235
- What?
- Yes!

766
00:51:15.531 --> 00:51:17.700
Ooh, Brenda.

767
00:51:17.783 --> 00:51:20.453
Did I tell you how sexy you look
in my jersey?

768
00:51:20.494 --> 00:51:23.247
- I do, Ray?
- Yes.

769
00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:26.208
I like it. Hey, get up.
Go over there. Let me see it.

770
00:51:30.629 --> 00:51:32.173
Ooh!

771
00:51:32.214 --> 00:51:34.800
Yes, I like that.

772
00:51:34.842 --> 00:51:37.178
- You like that? You like that?
- Yeah!

773
00:51:37.261 --> 00:51:39.763
Hey, put this on with it.

774
00:51:40.723 --> 00:51:44.643
- Ray, you are so freaky.
- That's right. You know I'm freaky, girl.

775
00:51:44.685 --> 00:51:46.812
Go on. Pull it up.

776
00:51:46.854 --> 00:51:49.064
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ahh!

777
00:51:49.148 --> 00:51:51.108
- Aah!
- Yeah.

778
00:51:51.192 --> 00:51:53.402
Here. Put this on with it.

779
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:55.863
Go on.

780
00:51:56.989 --> 00:52:01.076
- Are you sure?
- Go on, girl. Go on. Pull it on.

781
00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:03.537
- OK.
- Go on.

782
00:52:05.873 --> 00:52:09.710
- I like that look.
- Ooh! I'm bad.

783
00:52:09.793 --> 00:52:11.837
Yes. Here, put this on with it.

784
00:52:13.714 --> 00:52:16.008
Go on, girl. Put it on.

785
00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:19.178
Yeah. Put that shit on there.
Come on. Just shove it on.

786
00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:21.222
Do it. Yeah.

787
00:52:21.263 --> 00:52:23.140
Ooh, so fucking sexy.

788
00:52:23.224 --> 00:52:27.603
Come here, girl. Bring your little sexy ass
over here. Come on! Full speed. Charge!

789
00:52:31.273 --> 00:52:35.069
Yes! Yes! Come on! Turn around!
Turn around! Come on!

790
00:52:35.319 --> 00:52:37.947
Yes, Brendan!
Take it, Brendan! Take it, Brendan!

791
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:40.282
- Who?
- Uh... Brenda.

792
00:52:40.366 --> 00:52:44.453
Come on, put the helmet on.
No, let's role-play. Come on. You get me.

793
00:52:44.537 --> 00:52:46.205
Come on! Come on!

794
00:52:46.247 --> 00:52:50.459
I'm here at Lovers' Lookout.
It's dark, it's in the middle of nowhere,

795
00:52:50.543 --> 00:52:53.837
and it's where hormone-driven teens
love to come and fool around.

796
00:52:53.921 --> 00:52:57.091
So very likely we're about
to see someone get killed.

797
00:52:57.174 --> 00:53:00.970
OK, sure enough, there's a girl in that car,
blouse unbuttoned, all alone.

798
00:53:01.053 --> 00:53:03.764
Let's see if she'll have a word with us.

799
00:53:03.847 --> 00:53:07.768
Hi. Gail Hailstorm,
author of the new book <i>You're Next.</i>

800
00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:09.478
Oh, yeah.

801
00:53:09.562 --> 00:53:12.106
- Can you tell us your name?
- My name's Heather.

802
00:53:12.273 --> 00:53:15.359
Can you tell us
what you're doing out here all alone?

803
00:53:15.442 --> 00:53:19.113
Well, yeah, sure. My boyfriend and I
were just, like, making out,

804
00:53:19.154 --> 00:53:22.408
then we heard a noise
so he went to go check it, but...

805
00:53:22.449 --> 00:53:25.202
- Well, that was, like, ten minutes ago.
- Yeah, yeah...

806
00:53:25.286 --> 00:53:28.831
Has it crossed your little mind that
your boyfriend was probably murdered

807
00:53:28.914 --> 00:53:31.959
and you're about
to be slaughtered next?

808
00:53:32.042 --> 00:53:35.462
- Really? No way!
- Way.

809
00:53:35.504 --> 00:53:38.299
- Heather, good luck.
- Thanks, Gail. You're the best.

810
00:53:39.466 --> 00:53:42.011
Just as I thought!
The murder is happening as we speak!

811
00:53:42.094 --> 00:53:45.097
I'll try and break into the bloodshed.
Are you getting this?

812
00:53:45.139 --> 00:53:48.726
Excuse me. Heather, can you tell us
what you're feeling, honey?

813
00:53:48.809 --> 00:53:52.354
Lots of pain. Gail, please help me!
Gail, please!

814
00:53:52.438 --> 00:53:56.650
I'd like to help you out, kid, but it's sweeps.
Sir, sir, can I get a word with you?

815
00:53:56.692 --> 00:53:59.737
You got a nerve coming here!
I'm just trying to do my job!

816
00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:02.656
- Get the camera off me!
- No, Kenny, keep rolling!

817
00:54:02.698 --> 00:54:06.744
I'm gonna slice your head off and shove it
up his ass. Get that camera off me!

818
00:54:06.827 --> 00:54:10.831
Oh, my God, Kenny!
Kenny, move your fat ass!

819
00:54:11.582 --> 00:54:14.209
Kenny!
Oh, God, he's right behind you!

820
00:54:14.293 --> 00:54:16.670
This man is chasin' Miss Gail!

821
00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:25.763
I am so scared right now.

822
00:54:27.097 --> 00:54:29.350
I just want to say...

823
00:54:30.017 --> 00:54:33.020
to the family
of my cameraman, Kenny...

824
00:54:33.062 --> 00:54:35.189
I am so sorry.

825
00:54:35.856 --> 00:54:38.484
This was my interview,

826
00:54:39.193 --> 00:54:41.195
my story.

827
00:54:41.862 --> 00:54:44.156
It's all my fault.

828
00:54:49.036 --> 00:54:51.205
- You want some popcorn?
- Uh-uh.

829
00:54:51.288 --> 00:54:54.041
I brought me a little snack of my own.

830
00:54:56.794 --> 00:54:59.296
- You want some chicken?
- Nah.

831
00:55:02.716 --> 00:55:03.842
Mm-hm.

832
00:55:03.884 --> 00:55:07.805
For all y'all talkers up in here,
it's time to keep it down right now.

833
00:55:07.888 --> 00:55:09.598
Shh.

834
00:55:09.682 --> 00:55:12.059
"Shh" back at you. Shh!

835
00:55:14.478 --> 00:55:17.898
Why they actin' already?
It ain't nothin' but the previews.

836
00:55:21.527 --> 00:55:24.613
The largest ship
the world had ever known.

837
00:55:24.697 --> 00:55:29.535
Its 400 passengers and crew
on a maiden voyage to a brave new world.

838
00:55:29.576 --> 00:55:32.579
A journey that would
change their lives forever.

839
00:55:32.663 --> 00:55:35.374
Whoo!

840
00:55:37.418 --> 00:55:39.294
I'm the king of the world!

841
00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:42.423
Whoo-hoo!

842
00:55:42.506 --> 00:55:44.258
Whoo!

843
00:55:44.341 --> 00:55:45.509
Aaargh!

844
00:55:45.592 --> 00:55:48.387
- <i>Amistad II.</i>
- Get your ass back down there, boy!

845
00:55:48.429 --> 00:55:51.598
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
- The movie about to come on.

846
00:55:51.682 --> 00:55:54.226
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Here. Take your hot sauce.

847
00:55:54.268 --> 00:55:57.271
Hurry up, man. Don't be long.

848
00:55:57.771 --> 00:56:01.108
Back up! Let him through!

849
00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:04.027
You can move back some.
You don't own the theatre.

850
00:56:11.118 --> 00:56:14.830
And they're off! No.3 in the lead.
No.2 close behind.

851
00:56:14.913 --> 00:56:17.624
And No.3 is the winner!

852
00:56:20.335 --> 00:56:24.465
- Yeah, partner!
- No.2 has placed, and No.4 to show.

853
00:56:24.506 --> 00:56:27.468
Next week's Triple Crown
starts at 2:30.

854
00:56:56.997 --> 00:56:59.041
Hey, who was that?

855
00:56:59.583 --> 00:57:02.503
Go ahead, do it again. Do it again.

856
00:57:13.514 --> 00:57:15.516
Anon.

857
00:57:17.976 --> 00:57:20.270
Nn. Nn-nn. Nn-nnn!

858
00:57:21.438 --> 00:57:23.732
Don't go in there!

859
00:57:29.696 --> 00:57:33.742
Lord, I'm gonna have a heart attack!
Damn, this is some scary shit!

860
00:57:33.826 --> 00:57:36.703
Oh, I am scared! Oh!

861
00:57:36.787 --> 00:57:39.331
Excuse me!

862
00:57:39.373 --> 00:57:42.376
I think I paid my money
like everybody else up in here.

863
00:57:42.417 --> 00:57:45.546
- Out of her favour...
- That ain't no man.

864
00:57:45.629 --> 00:57:48.382
- You can see her real hair right there!
- Do you mind?

865
00:57:48.423 --> 00:57:51.385
I know you better get outta my face!

866
00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:54.555
Outta my face!
Outta my face!

867
00:57:54.638 --> 00:57:57.266
This is all me up in here.
You handle that.

868
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:59.852
- Will you shut the fuck up?
- Yeah!

869
00:57:59.893 --> 00:58:01.395
Mm-mm.

870
00:58:01.478 --> 00:58:03.188
This movie is good.

871
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:07.818
Hey, baby.
You came back just in time.

872
00:58:07.901 --> 00:58:10.529
She's about to get it on
with Shakespeare.

873
00:58:10.571 --> 00:58:13.574
- He found out she's a girl.
- Shut up.

874
00:58:13.657 --> 00:58:17.077
Yeah, I got you.
I got you on camera.

875
00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:19.496
<i>You on Candid Camera</i> now.

876
00:58:20.205 --> 00:58:22.124
You ain't know that.

877
00:58:25.168 --> 00:58:26.461
Hello?

878
00:58:26.545 --> 00:58:30.924
Hey, girl. Uh-uh. I'm in a movie.
<i>Shakespeare in Love.</i>

879
00:58:31.008 --> 00:58:33.302
Uh-uh. Ooh!

880
00:58:33.385 --> 00:58:37.222
- You lyin'!
- For Christ's sake, just shut your trap!

881
00:58:37.264 --> 00:58:39.641
- Shut up!
- Hold on.

882
00:58:39.725 --> 00:58:42.644
I don't know why y'all is actin' like this.

883
00:58:42.728 --> 00:58:45.939
My girlfriend said they don't
even stay together in the end.

884
00:58:45.981 --> 00:58:48.108
Give me that.

885
00:58:48.859 --> 00:58:50.569
Right on.

886
00:58:51.778 --> 00:58:53.572
Will you sit down?

887
00:58:54.865 --> 00:58:56.825
Shut up!

888
00:58:56.909 --> 00:58:58.952
Your ass is grass.

889
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:05.167
- This is for Thelma!
- And Louise!

890
00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:07.920
This is for talking through <i>The Fugitive!</i>

891
00:59:07.961 --> 00:59:10.923
- You ruined <i>Schindler's List!</i>
- All Jackie Chan movies!

892
00:59:10.964 --> 00:59:15.260
<i>- Boogie Nights!</i>
- And <i>Big Momma 's House!</i>

893
00:59:19.139 --> 00:59:24.269
Aaaghh!

894
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:42.079
Um, you guys,
there's a few too many people.

895
00:59:42.162 --> 00:59:45.415
Oh, honey, please don't throw up.
No, hey, you guys, stop.

896
00:59:45.499 --> 00:59:47.709
Hey! Hey, please! That's my dad's!

897
00:59:47.793 --> 00:59:51.380
- No, don't touch... Agh! No!
- Do you have more beer?

898
00:59:51.463 --> 00:59:53.590
Um, yeah.
Uh, check in the garage.

899
00:59:53.674 --> 00:59:56.051
No, no, no, no! No!

900
01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:20.867
Oh! Kitty, you scared me.

901
01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:23.078
Oh!

902
01:00:24.997 --> 01:00:29.292
Horsey!
Oh, you scared me too.

903
01:00:32.921 --> 01:00:34.881
Hello?

904
01:00:34.923 --> 01:00:36.133
Who's there?

905
01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:41.722
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Please don't.

906
01:00:41.763 --> 01:00:44.433
Please! I'm just a day player.

907
01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:02.325
Oh, my God!

908
01:01:29.102 --> 01:01:33.315
Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

909
01:01:37.778 --> 01:01:40.113
Yeah! Yeah!

910
01:01:41.948 --> 01:01:44.117
Oh, Bobby! Bobby.

911
01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:46.286
I was worried about you.

912
01:01:46.328 --> 01:01:49.706
I thought the killer got to you
before I could.

913
01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:51.625
Could what?

914
01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:55.837
I wanna go upstairs.
There's something I wanna show you.

915
01:01:56.797 --> 01:01:59.299
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

916
01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:02.177
Hey, party on!

917
01:02:07.474 --> 01:02:09.601
- So...
- So...

918
01:02:10.602 --> 01:02:13.188
Here we are again.

919
01:02:13.271 --> 01:02:14.940
Yeah.

920
01:02:16.817 --> 01:02:19.945
And, you know, if you're not ready...

921
01:02:20.821 --> 01:02:22.823
I'll understand.

922
01:02:23.698 --> 01:02:25.534
Bobby.

923
01:02:25.617 --> 01:02:27.619
I am ready.

924
01:02:28.787 --> 01:02:30.956
- You are?
- Yeah.

925
01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:36.461
I can't keep fighting these urges.

926
01:02:37.337 --> 01:02:40.507
I have to just give in to them

927
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:42.467
and let them flow.

928
01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:44.761
Right.

929
01:02:44.845 --> 01:02:46.471
- Bobby?
- Huh?

930
01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:49.599
I have been so selfish.

931
01:02:51.518 --> 01:02:54.062
This is like a scene
from a movie or something.

932
01:02:54.146 --> 01:02:56.815
Only it isn't a movie, Bobby.

933
01:02:56.857 --> 01:02:58.775
This is real life.

934
01:02:59.985 --> 01:03:02.362
It's all a movie, baby.

935
01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:06.324
There's the sound guy, the script
supervisor. How you doin', baby?

936
01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:08.410
- Bobby!
- What?

937
01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:11.872
What I mean

938
01:03:11.913 --> 01:03:16.793
is that in real life
you have to enjoy each moment.

939
01:03:16.877 --> 01:03:18.795
Mm-hm.

940
01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:43.236
Mmm! Oh!

941
01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:45.280
Ow! Ow!

942
01:03:45.363 --> 01:03:47.532
Bobby! Bobby!

943
01:03:51.369 --> 01:03:53.371
Can I tell you a secret?

944
01:03:54.122 --> 01:03:56.124
Sure, man.

945
01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:59.252
I see dead people.

946
01:04:01.213 --> 01:04:04.090
Man, this shit is awesome!

947
01:04:04.132 --> 01:04:06.676
Yo, son, we gotta roll
some more of that shit!

948
01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.428
Ah, Shit!

949
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:11.264
We don't have any more papers, man.

950
01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:13.350
Don't have any more papers.

951
01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:17.395
Oh, man!
What can we use to make a bong?

952
01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:24.444
Toke! Toke! Toke!
Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke!

953
01:04:24.486 --> 01:04:26.363
Yeah!

954
01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:36.456
Oh, shit, son!

955
01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:40.961
Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke!
Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke! To...

956
01:04:41.962 --> 01:04:44.089
This is some good shit!

957
01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:11.408
Bobby! I've never done this before.

958
01:05:12.784 --> 01:05:16.246
It's OK. It's OK.
It's just like...

959
01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:19.541
- It's like sucking on a Tootsie Roll Pop.
- A Tootsie Pop?

960
01:05:19.624 --> 01:05:21.918
Yeah, a cherry-flavour one.

961
01:05:22.002 --> 01:05:24.796
- Oh.
- With the fudge in the middle?

962
01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:28.550
OK!

963
01:05:33.221 --> 01:05:34.973
Just like that.

964
01:05:35.015 --> 01:05:37.559
Just like that, baby.

965
01:05:39.894 --> 01:05:40.895
Argh!

966
01:05:40.979 --> 01:05:43.481
Oh! Jesus!

967
01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:48.361
I never could wait
to get to the chewy middle.

968
01:05:48.403 --> 01:05:50.405
You know what? Let me.

969
01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:53.033
Goddamn!

970
01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:21.770
Yeah! Guess it's been a while.

971
01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.569
Oh! Oops!

972
01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:32.655
It's very '70s of you.

973
01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:50.340
Oh, yeah.

974
01:06:50.423 --> 01:06:52.092
Oh, Bobby!

975
01:06:55.095 --> 01:06:58.056
Come here, Bobby. I want it now!

976
01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:03.269
- Oh, man, am I fuckin' stoned!
- Yeah, me too.

977
01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:05.605
Hey. Hey, you guys hear that?

978
01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:11.945
Oh!

979
01:07:17.784 --> 01:07:19.786
Shh! Shh!

980
01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:26.960
- Hello?
- Hello. What's your favourite scary movie?

981
01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:33.550
Let me talk to her. Shh!

982
01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:37.470
I'm gonna gut you like a pig!

983
01:07:44.644 --> 01:07:48.356
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

984
01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:50.316
What's my name, Bobby?

985
01:07:50.358 --> 01:07:51.776
What?

986
01:07:51.818 --> 01:07:55.488
- What's my name, bitch?
- Ow! God! It's Cindy!

987
01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:58.616
Whose is it, Bobby?
Whose is it, Bobby?

988
01:07:58.658 --> 01:08:00.702
It's yours.

989
01:08:05.999 --> 01:08:07.375
Oh, my God!

990
01:08:10.962 --> 01:08:13.423
Oh, shit!

991
01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:28.688
Hey, yo, check it, yo.

992
01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:43.912
- Whoo-hoo!
- I got one. I got one. Here it goes. Ready?

993
01:08:43.995 --> 01:08:46.748
<i>I'm gonna slash and gash,
out another hole in your ass</i>

994
01:08:46.831 --> 01:08:49.292
<i>I spill blood on the walls,
then play tennis with your balls</i>

995
01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:51.252
<i>If the phone rings, don't answer that call</i>

996
01:08:51.336 --> 01:08:53.254
<i>Gonna slit your throat,
fuck you like a goat</i>

997
01:08:53.338 --> 01:08:55.381
<i>Peel your foreskin off
and make a Winter coat</i>

998
01:08:55.423 --> 01:08:57.091
Peace!

999
01:08:59.219 --> 01:09:00.887
Yo!

1000
01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:06.351
That was the illest rhyme
I ever seen, son!

1001
01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:10.396
Bobby?

1002
01:09:10.438 --> 01:09:14.567
- Where were you tonight?
- What?

1003
01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:18.112
I was just curious.
What took you so long to get here?

1004
01:09:18.196 --> 01:09:20.281
Why are you so curious?

1005
01:09:21.533 --> 01:09:23.535
I don't know.

1006
01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:28.873
I thought it would fit the '903 horror cliche
if you turned out to be the killer.

1007
01:09:28.915 --> 01:09:31.751
Oh, so, what?
You think I killed Buffy and Greg?

1008
01:09:33.461 --> 01:09:35.797
Buffy and Greg are dead?

1009
01:09:36.923 --> 01:09:38.758
- I thought you knew that.
- Oh, God!

1010
01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:41.469
Bobby, turn around! It's the killer!

1011
01:09:41.553 --> 01:09:43.012
Agh!

1012
01:09:55.942 --> 01:09:57.944
Cindy!

1013
01:09:58.027 --> 01:10:01.614
- Oh, my God! Bobby! Bobby!
- Cindy. Help me.

1014
01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:07.453
- Bobby, it's OK.
- Give me the gun. Give me the gun...

1015
01:10:07.495 --> 01:10:09.497
It's gonna be OK, Bobby.

1016
01:10:11.082 --> 01:10:14.085
Yo, wait for me.
There's a killer in the house!

1017
01:10:14.127 --> 01:10:17.797
There's ass, blood and guts everywhere.
Someone done gone crazy, son!

1018
01:10:19.966 --> 01:10:22.010
We all go a little crazy sometimes.

1019
01:10:22.093 --> 01:10:23.595
Bobby, no!

1020
01:10:24.137 --> 01:10:26.973
Oh, shit, son!

1021
01:10:27.015 --> 01:10:29.976
Oh! Oh, my God!

1022
01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:34.480
Cindy, he shot me in the lungs.

1023
01:10:36.316 --> 01:10:38.318
You wanna hit this shit?

1024
01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:44.365
Ketchup.

1025
01:10:44.449 --> 01:10:47.076
Just like my mom
puts on her spaghetti, baby.

1026
01:10:49.037 --> 01:10:53.249
Oh, my God! Ray, you've gotta help me!
Bobby's gone crazy!

1027
01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:55.710
Surprise!

1028
01:10:55.793 --> 01:10:58.671
Surprise, Cindy.

1029
01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.727
Why are you doing this, Bobby?

1030
01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.812
Why? Why?

1031
01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:18.983
You hear that, Ray?
I think she wants a motive.

1032
01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:22.195
- Did <i>Scream</i> have a plot?
- No!

1033
01:11:22.236 --> 01:11:26.699
Did <i>I Know What You Did Last Summer</i>
make any sense? Don't think so!

1034
01:11:26.741 --> 01:11:29.243
And the sequel?
What was with that fat Jamaican?

1035
01:11:29.327 --> 01:11:33.331
- I wanna kill that motherfucker.
- It was bad casting, Bobby.

1036
01:11:33.373 --> 01:11:36.084
How about this for a motive?
Lack of sex!

1037
01:11:36.167 --> 01:11:39.462
It can cause serious deviant behaviour.

1038
01:11:39.545 --> 01:11:44.133
- I thought you loved me.
- Oh, I did, baby. I did.

1039
01:11:44.217 --> 01:11:47.220
But abstinence makes you discover
new things about yourself.

1040
01:11:47.261 --> 01:11:49.847
That's right, Cindy. I'm gay.

1041
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:54.060
And in case you haven't noticed, so is Ray.

1042
01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:56.562
What? I ain't gay.

1043
01:11:56.646 --> 01:12:00.983
- What? You took me to that club.
- So? They play good music.

1044
01:12:01.067 --> 01:12:05.738
- What about our trip to San Francisco?
- I wanted to go shopping.

1045
01:12:05.822 --> 01:12:09.701
- But you made love to me.
- No. First of all, you sucked my...

1046
01:12:09.742 --> 01:12:14.163
Whatever, Ray! I don't wanna talk about
this now. The point is, I'm a new man.

1047
01:12:14.247 --> 01:12:16.874
I'm ready to leave this behind
and start a new life.

1048
01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:20.461
- So you killed all your friends?
- Oh, no.

1049
01:12:20.545 --> 01:12:22.088
Just you.

1050
01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:24.882
And maybe Shorty,
but that wasn't planned.

1051
01:12:24.924 --> 01:12:27.093
But here's the genius part.

1052
01:12:27.135 --> 01:12:30.763
We're copycatting a serial killer
that already exists.

1053
01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:34.726
- It's the perfect crime, Cindy.
- But wait! There's more!

1054
01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:39.939
Hang on to your seat, baby,
cos this one's a screamer!

1055
01:12:39.981 --> 01:12:43.443
- I'll be back.
- Uh-oh.

1056
01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:45.987
Move your big ass. Come on.

1057
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:48.364
Dad!

1058
01:12:48.448 --> 01:12:50.950
What are you gonna do, frame him?

1059
01:12:50.992 --> 01:12:55.496
Nah. We're just havin'
a little bit of fun with old daddio.

1060
01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:58.416
The police are gonna find
you and Daddy both dead,

1061
01:12:58.458 --> 01:13:01.919
and me and Ray are the only survivors
of a maniac's revenge.

1062
01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:02.962
- Ready?
- Ready?

1063
01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:05.631
- I'm ready to do this shit.
- Let's do this shit.

1064
01:13:05.673 --> 01:13:09.886
- Come on. Come on. All right.
- All right. Give it to me.

1065
01:13:09.969 --> 01:13:11.929
No! Wait, wait, wait.

1066
01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:16.225
- All right, ready? Let's do this.
- Wait, wait. Ready.

1067
01:13:16.309 --> 01:13:18.394
- Come on. Come on.
- Ready.

1068
01:13:18.478 --> 01:13:21.230
- Give it to me!
- No! Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1069
01:13:21.314 --> 01:13:24.275
- Remember what we said?
- How many times we gonna go over this?

1070
01:13:24.317 --> 01:13:27.612
I know. OK. Stop. Just...
Trust me, OK?

1071
01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:30.031
- I got this shit. Ready?
- Come on.

1072
01:13:30.114 --> 01:13:32.909
- Wait, wait!
- I'm about to cut your throat, boy!

1073
01:13:32.992 --> 01:13:35.286
Stop acting like a little girl. Come on!

1074
01:13:35.328 --> 01:13:38.080
- You're right.
- Come on! You ready?

1075
01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:41.667
No! You guys are psychos!

1076
01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:44.128
You've seen one too many TV shows!

1077
01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:48.508
No! Watching television shows
doesn't create psycho killers.

1078
01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:50.927
Cancelling TV shows does!

1079
01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:53.554
<i>The Wayans Bros</i>
was a good show, man!

1080
01:13:53.638 --> 01:13:57.975
It was a good-ass show,
and we didn't even get a final episode!

1081
01:13:58.017 --> 01:14:01.270
Take it easy.
I'm feelin' a little woozy here.

1082
01:14:01.729 --> 01:14:04.190
It's my turn.
Give me the knife.

1083
01:14:04.232 --> 01:14:07.527
Fuck outta here.
Ain't nobody stabbin' me.

1084
01:14:09.362 --> 01:14:10.571
Oh!

1085
01:14:15.827 --> 01:14:17.537
- Surprise, Cindy.
- Agh!

1086
01:14:25.169 --> 01:14:26.796
Yah!

1087
01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.344
Agh!

1088
01:14:36.514 --> 01:14:38.182
Ohh!

1089
01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:05.751
Yah!

1090
01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:14.260
All right, all right, all right.
Hold on a second.

1091
01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:17.138
Just give me a moment.
Agh. One...

1092
01:15:23.811 --> 01:15:26.480
That's it. Agh. OK.

1093
01:15:28.065 --> 01:15:29.859
Yah!

1094
01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:03.809
Dad!

1095
01:16:04.936 --> 01:16:05.937
Are you OK?

1096
01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:08.898
I thought I told you not to have a party
unless I was here.

1097
01:16:08.981 --> 01:16:11.442
But, Dad, you were here.
You were in the closet.

1098
01:16:11.484 --> 01:16:15.321
Oh, yeah, that's right. Did you get
some girlfriends' numbers for me?

1099
01:16:15.363 --> 01:16:18.658
- Dad, they're dead.
- Ah, you know, I can't get a break.

1100
01:16:18.699 --> 01:16:20.826
What's that? Is that the cops?

1101
01:16:20.868 --> 01:16:23.496
OK, OK, listen, honey.
Help me up now.

1102
01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:26.540
Uh, if the cops come,
tell 'em I'm a plumber, OK?

1103
01:16:26.624 --> 01:16:30.753
You had a leaky faucet and they sent
me over. We don't even know each other.

1104
01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:38.886
No! No!

1105
01:16:39.971 --> 01:16:42.848
Dad, get your arms down.

1106
01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:47.103
- What's goin' on?
- Sheriff, it's a bloodbath.

1107
01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:49.522
- He was right here! I swear it!
- Who was?

1108
01:16:49.563 --> 01:16:53.275
The killer!
The guy that murdered all my friends!

1109
01:16:53.359 --> 01:16:56.988
And the sick bastard planted drugs
all in the house there.

1110
01:16:57.029 --> 01:17:00.032
- All over the place.
- Dad. Stop it.

1111
01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:02.994
Cindy, I'm gonna have to take you
down to the station.

1112
01:17:03.035 --> 01:17:05.538
I'm cool, though, right? I'm OK?

1113
01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:08.416
- Let's go, Cindy.
- Cindy...

1114
01:17:08.499 --> 01:17:11.335
Call me. Call me.

1115
01:17:11.377 --> 01:17:12.920
Daddy'll get you out, honey.

1116
01:17:15.089 --> 01:17:16.757
OK.

1117
01:17:17.925 --> 01:17:20.094
Let's go over this again.

1118
01:17:31.772 --> 01:17:35.234
- You say it was an accident.
- Yes. He was on the road.

1119
01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:38.821
And he came back to get revenge?
- It has to be him, Sheriff.

1120
01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:49.457
- Here. They wanted me to give this to you.
- That'll be all, Doofy.

1121
01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:52.585
- OK. I'm gonna go, then.
- All right.

1122
01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:54.712
All right.

1123
01:17:54.754 --> 01:17:56.505
Night, Cind.

1124
01:17:59.592 --> 01:18:02.094
Sorry, Cindy.
It wasn't the man you guys killed.

1125
01:18:02.136 --> 01:18:05.639
He was David Keegan. Some fishermen
found his body a few weeks later.

1126
01:18:05.723 --> 01:18:09.185
- He's buried in Lakewood Cemetery.
- That's impossible.

1127
01:18:11.145 --> 01:18:14.982
- Then I don't know who it could be.
- He's gotta be connected with the victims.

1128
01:18:15.066 --> 01:18:20.613
Someone who knew about the accident,
who'd move round without being noticed.

1129
01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:24.450
Oh, my God.

1130
01:18:25.618 --> 01:18:29.538
She used to baby-sit my brother Doofy.
He had the biggest crush on her.

1131
01:18:29.622 --> 01:18:31.707
Agh! It's me, Cind.

1132
01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:34.210
Night, Cind.

1133
01:18:38.047 --> 01:18:40.216
- Doofy!
- Shithead?

1134
01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:44.595
- Have you seen Doofy?
- No.

1135
01:18:44.637 --> 01:18:46.305
- You seen Doofy?
- No, Sheriff.

1136
01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:50.059
- Has anybody seen Doofy?
- Yeah. He just went out the back, Sheriff.

1137
01:18:50.142 --> 01:18:51.811
Doofy!

1138
01:19:42.903 --> 01:19:49.577
No!

1139
01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:05.676
{\an8}Shit, son. Yo, what the deal?

1140
01:20:05.718 --> 01:20:10.389
{\an8}Yo, if y'all watchin' this tape right now,
that means I didn't make it.

1141
01:20:10.472 --> 01:20:14.560
{\an8}Either I'm a prisoner, or worse, dead.

1142
01:20:14.602 --> 01:20:18.939
{\an8}But either way it goes, I'm gonna tell y'all
the rules to survive this situation.

1143
01:20:19.023 --> 01:20:22.234
{\an8}Rule number one: you gotta be quick.

1144
01:20:22.276 --> 01:20:25.654
{\an8}Rule number two: don't fall down.

1145
01:20:25.738 --> 01:20:30.910
{\an8}And rule number three:
whatever you do, never look back.

1146
01:20:30.951 --> 01:20:32.953
{\an8}Y'all wish me luck.

1147
01:20:33.037 --> 01:20:35.039
{\an8}Snatch and run, y'all!

1148
01:20:37.917 --> 01:20:40.336
Come back here, motherfuckers!
Son of a bitch!

1149
01:23:34.134 --> 01:23:36.595
Help! Help!

1150
01:23:42.059 --> 01:23:45.354
Run, bitch! Run!

1151
01:27:39.796 --> 01:27:42.007
This isn't easy for me.

1152
01:27:42.049 --> 01:27:48.513
I know we've been together a long time,
but I've found somebody else, OK?

1153
01:27:48.555 --> 01:27:50.557
I'm in love.

1154
01:27:51.183 --> 01:27:53.393
Don't look at me like that.

1155
01:27:54.353 --> 01:27:56.813
We can still be friends.

1156
01:27:56.855 --> 01:27:59.858
You can come into my room
whenever you want.

1157
01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:01.401
We just can't...

1158
01:28:01.485 --> 01:28:02.986
No.

1159
01:28:04.321 --> 01:28:05.822
No!

1160
01:28:08.909 --> 01:28:10.911
OK, just one time.

1161
01:28:17.584 --> 01:28:19.920
Yeah! That's it!

1162
01:28:21.922 --> 01:28:23.215
Whoo!
