00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:33.791
- Hello.
- Wanna have a little fun?

2
00:00:33.792 --> 00:00:34.792
Who is this?

3
00:00:34.793 --> 00:00:36.909
Tell me your name and
I'll tell you mine.

4
00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:39.076
I don't think so.

5
00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.875
- What's that noise?
- Oops. I farted.

6
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.936
I didn't think you would hear me.

7
00:00:43.937 --> 00:00:45.334
No, that popping noise.

8
00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:49.294
Oh. I'm making popcorn. I'm
getting ready to watch a video.

9
00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:52.876
- Ooh. What is it?
- It's just a scary movie.

10
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:55.051
Do you like scary movies?

11
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.466
- What's your favourite?
- Mm, I don't know.

12
00:00:58.601 --> 00:01:00.344
Think.

13
00:01:00.478 --> 00:01:04.012
Oh, I know. Kazaam. You know, the
one where Shaq plays a genie.

14
00:01:04.148 --> 00:01:05.562
That's not a horror movie.

15
00:01:05.563 --> 00:01:07.683
Yeah, well, you haven't
seen Shaq act.

16
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.690
- Hey, you have a nice voice.
- Thanks.

17
00:01:12.824 --> 00:01:14.900
You never did tell me your name.

18
00:01:15.034 --> 00:01:17.241
Why do you wanna know my name?

19
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.040
Because I wanna know
who I'm looking at.

20
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.873
What did you say?

21
00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:26.208
Nice breasts.

22
00:01:26.338 --> 00:01:28.212
Look, what do you want?

23
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.009
I wanna see what your
insides look like.

24
00:01:31.134 --> 00:01:33.460
Well... Well, then,
turn to page 54.

25
00:01:33.595 --> 00:01:35.505
Oh.

26
00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:37.217
Hey, nice.

27
00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:43.188
Listen, asshole, you've had your
fun, now you better stop or else.

28
00:01:43.314 --> 00:01:44.314
Or else what?

29
00:01:44.315 --> 00:01:46.350
Or else my boyfriend's going
to be here any minute...

30
00:01:46.484 --> 00:01:48.476
and he's black and
he'll kick your ass.

31
00:01:48.611 --> 00:01:49.939
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

32
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:52.740
You mean the one who wears make-up
and dresses like a woman?

33
00:01:52.865 --> 00:01:55.819
- How did you know?
- Turn the porch lights on.

34
00:02:02.042 --> 00:02:05.078
Help. Help.

35
00:02:05.212 --> 00:02:07.121
Oh, that's not my boyfriend.

36
00:02:07.255 --> 00:02:09.581
I mean, I've fucked him a
couple of times, but that's it.

37
00:02:10.884 --> 00:02:12.924
Look, I'm calling the cops.

38
00:02:13.053 --> 00:02:15.259
Go ahead. Call the cops.

39
00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.390
But you might wanna check
the back door first.

40
00:02:18.517 --> 00:02:20.474
You forgot to lock it.

41
00:02:43.251 --> 00:02:45.458
Take that, you psycho.

42
00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.006
I can't feel my legs.

43
00:02:51.134 --> 00:02:53.341
I think my arm is broken.

44
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.005
- Sorry.
- I want my mummy.

45
00:03:00.728 --> 00:03:01.973
Hello, Drew.

46
00:03:16.327 --> 00:03:17.987
Oh, God.

47
00:03:19.497 --> 00:03:21.371
Oh, God.

48
00:04:07.964 --> 00:04:10.502
No.

49
00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:25.558
Daddy. Daddy.

50
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:29.689
Daddy. Daddy.

51
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.021
Daddy, no. No.

52
00:04:35.868 --> 00:04:38.822
- Did you hear something?
- No, I didn't hear anything.

53
00:05:07.234 --> 00:05:10.152
Bobby, what are you doing?
My dad's in the other room.

54
00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:11.474
It just occurred to me I never

55
00:05:11.475 --> 00:05:12.948
climbed through
your window before.

56
00:05:13.073 --> 00:05:15.150
Yeah, well, now that you got it
out of your system, Bobby...

57
00:05:15.284 --> 00:05:16.549
- What?
- You have to leave.

58
00:05:16.551 --> 00:05:18.055
Why?

59
00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:20.285
Come on.

60
00:05:20.873 --> 00:05:22.284
What's going on in there?

61
00:05:22.417 --> 00:05:25.702
Ow. Daddy's head is stuck.
Unstick Daddy's head.

62
00:05:27.338 --> 00:05:29.378
- Dad, can you knock?
- Knock?

63
00:05:29.507 --> 00:05:31.743
I thought I heard
screaming in here.

64
00:05:31.744 --> 00:05:33.291
No. No, you didn't, Dad.

65
00:05:33.428 --> 00:05:36.049
Well, it could've been that crack
I smoked earlier, I guess.

66
00:05:36.181 --> 00:05:37.972
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, that's what it was.

67
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.721
Listen, I got to leave town for a
couple of days. Okay? No big deal.

68
00:05:40.852 --> 00:05:43.119
Just, you know that new business I
started with those Colombian guys?

69
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.679
Oh, you mean Uncle Escobar. Yeah.

70
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.892
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

71
00:05:46.024 --> 00:05:48.068
Well, there's a problem.
Some money went missing.

72
00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:50.112
And apparently, some legs
are going to get broken.

73
00:05:50.113 --> 00:05:51.780
It's just better if I lay
low for a couple of days.

74
00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:52.781
Okay.

75
00:05:52.782 --> 00:05:54.388
Now, if the cops raid the place...

76
00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:55.485
I never heard of you.

77
00:05:55.618 --> 00:05:57.907
- And don't forget...
- To flush your stash.

78
00:05:58.037 --> 00:06:00.824
Oh, you are my little girl.
I love you so much...

79
00:06:00.957 --> 00:06:02.996
that I left you a little
something in the coffee can.

80
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.010
Dad...

81
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:06.660
But you have to remember to
step on it before you sell it.

82
00:06:06.796 --> 00:06:08.949
Now, what are you
going to cut it with?

83
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:09.950
Baking...

84
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:11.673
- Baking soda. Not baking powder.
- Soda.

85
00:06:11.801 --> 00:06:13.215
Because baking powder
guys will have

86
00:06:13.216 --> 00:06:14.553
muffins growing out of their nose.

87
00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:15.679
Dad.

88
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.170
You love that joke,
don't you, honey?

89
00:06:17.307 --> 00:06:20.474
You've loved that joke since
you were two years old.

90
00:06:20.602 --> 00:06:22.429
- Okay, well...
- Okay, I love you.

91
00:06:22.562 --> 00:06:24.721
- I love you.
- Have a good trip.

92
00:06:24.856 --> 00:06:27.264
- Bye.
- Bye.

93
00:06:28.402 --> 00:06:30.026
Is the coast clear?

94
00:06:30.154 --> 00:06:32.859
Oh, Cindy, that nightgown.

95
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.157
That was close. God.

96
00:06:39.163 --> 00:06:44.205
I was, home watching The Exorcist,
and it got me thinking about you.

97
00:06:44.335 --> 00:06:46.350
If this is about the
time I puked green

98
00:06:46.351 --> 00:06:48.415
slime and masturbated
with a crucifix...

99
00:06:48.548 --> 00:06:50.706
It was my first keg party, Bobby.

100
00:06:50.842 --> 00:06:55.303
No. No. It was edited for TV.
All the good stuff was cut out.

101
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.301
So you thought you would just
climb through my window...

102
00:06:58.433 --> 00:07:00.426
and we would play bump-bump?

103
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.600
Oh, I was kind of hoping to
get my balls licked, but...

104
00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:05.399
I wouldn't wanna break your little
underwear rule, now, would I?

105
00:07:05.524 --> 00:07:08.774
So maybe just some
on-top-of-the-clothes-type stuff?

106
00:07:11.905 --> 00:07:14.990
Okay. But just for a minute.

107
00:07:30.299 --> 00:07:31.710
What the...

108
00:07:33.094 --> 00:07:34.636
Wrong set.

109
00:07:38.224 --> 00:07:40.929
Bobby. Oh, Bobby.

110
00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:43.100
I don't wanna wait

111
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.555
For our lives to be over

112
00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.268
- No, Bobby, don't.
- Ow.

113
00:07:49.528 --> 00:07:52.280
Jeez. I see, yeah.

114
00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:55.360
Yeah, my dad.

115
00:07:55.492 --> 00:08:00.154
Okay, stud, you have to go now.

116
00:08:03.167 --> 00:08:05.623
Oh, about the sex stuff?

117
00:08:05.753 --> 00:08:08.125
I was only half serious. I mean, I
don't wanna rush you or anything.

118
00:08:08.256 --> 00:08:11.459
Hey, would you settle for PG-13?

119
00:08:11.592 --> 00:08:14.166
What's that?

120
00:08:15.597 --> 00:08:17.589
Oh, jeez.

121
00:08:17.724 --> 00:08:19.515
Good night, Bobby.

122
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.062
Shorty, you are so loud.

123
00:08:28.193 --> 00:08:30.814
And make sure you take your
behind to class today.

124
00:08:30.946 --> 00:08:33.947
- I do be going to class.
- Lunch is not a class, Shorty.

125
00:08:34.074 --> 00:08:36.612
It is when you got the munchies.

126
00:08:36.744 --> 00:08:39.537
See, that's why you
such a dumb-ass.

127
00:08:39.538 --> 00:08:40.611
Your mother.

128
00:08:40.748 --> 00:08:44.662
You my brother. That's
your mother too, jackass.

129
00:08:44.794 --> 00:08:48.044
Oh, yeah. Well, then,
your father's stupid.

130
00:08:48.172 --> 00:08:50.710
So? I don't know him.

131
00:08:50.842 --> 00:08:53.677
Yeah, me neither.

132
00:08:53.803 --> 00:08:57.504
- Hey, girl, you ready?
- Yeah, in a minute.

133
00:08:59.267 --> 00:09:02.718
- Come on. We're going to be late.
- Ooh, wait. There's Buffy.

134
00:09:02.854 --> 00:09:05.345
I don't know why you
hang out with her.

135
00:09:05.482 --> 00:09:08.234
- She is such a ho.
- Why do you say that?

136
00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.436
Because I've seen her.

137
00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.661
My friend Sean had a
pool party this summer.

138
00:09:12.662 --> 00:09:13.662
Sean?

139
00:09:13.663 --> 00:09:15.198
You know, Puff Daddy?

140
00:09:15.325 --> 00:09:18.030
Anyway, everybody was
drinking Cristal champagne.

141
00:09:18.162 --> 00:09:19.715
And then it started to
get wild, and people

142
00:09:19.716 --> 00:09:21.198
was getting freaky in
the pool and stuff.

143
00:09:21.332 --> 00:09:23.668
I look over and
there was your girl

144
00:09:23.669 --> 00:09:25.875
getting buck wild in the Jacuzzi.

145
00:09:26.003 --> 00:09:27.118
So?

146
00:09:27.254 --> 00:09:30.374
With a backup dancer.

147
00:09:30.508 --> 00:09:34.340
I mean, that's nasty. That's
lower than the security guard.

148
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:38.551
At least security can get you
backstage. She don't love herself.

149
00:09:38.683 --> 00:09:39.683
Bye, Daddy.

150
00:09:39.684 --> 00:09:41.684
I don't know. I think
Buffy's sweet, Brenda.

151
00:09:41.811 --> 00:09:45.394
Oh, she is as fake
as Press-on nails.

152
00:09:45.523 --> 00:09:47.812
- Hey, baby girl.
- Hi.

153
00:09:48.401 --> 00:09:51.402
- Hi.
- What is up, my sister?

154
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.400
- Bye, Mr Gilmore.
- Bye.

155
00:09:54.533 --> 00:09:55.992
- Is he gone?
- Yep.

156
00:09:56.785 --> 00:10:00.830
Do you like what you see

157
00:10:00.956 --> 00:10:03.708
It's all about the money

158
00:10:03.834 --> 00:10:06.408
- Hey, Cindy.
- It's the only way to be

159
00:10:09.423 --> 00:10:12.045
- I love this colour.
- Let me see that.

160
00:10:14.011 --> 00:10:16.698
Oh, you guys should
not use this brand.

161
00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:17.699
Why not?

162
00:10:17.724 --> 00:10:19.912
Because they test their
products on animals.

163
00:10:19.913 --> 00:10:20.913
So?

164
00:10:20.914 --> 00:10:25.312
Look, have you seen what they
do to those poor animals?

165
00:10:27.233 --> 00:10:30.934
Well, I am much more
of a people person.

166
00:10:31.071 --> 00:10:34.274
I'd like to feed all the hungry
little children of the world.

167
00:10:34.408 --> 00:10:36.187
I'd much rather help my
fellow man than some animal.

168
00:10:36.188 --> 00:10:37.188
Spare a dollar?

169
00:10:37.189 --> 00:10:39.235
- Oh. Get away from me, you bum.
- Buffy.

170
00:10:39.371 --> 00:10:41.743
Can't you see he's just hungry?

171
00:10:41.874 --> 00:10:45.741
Here you go, sir. A
nice sandwich for ya.

172
00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:49.745
- See?
- I said a dollar, bitch.

173
00:10:49.882 --> 00:10:51.756
Ow.

174
00:10:51.884 --> 00:10:54.968
God. Look at this place.

175
00:10:55.096 --> 00:10:57.468
It's a circus.

176
00:10:57.598 --> 00:11:02.260
Hello. I'm Gail Hailstorm, author
of the book You're Dead, I'm Rich.

177
00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:04.471
A small college
town is in shock...

178
00:11:04.606 --> 00:11:06.894
after the unthinkable
has happened:

179
00:11:07.025 --> 00:11:09.730
a brutal killing spree
that left one teen dead...

180
00:11:09.861 --> 00:11:12.399
That's it. Two teens dead...

181
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.819
and this small town
shaken and stirred.

182
00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:16.302
It's times like these...

183
00:11:16.303 --> 00:11:18.485
Police are combing
the area for clues.

184
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.827
It seems there are no witnesses
available at this time.

185
00:11:20.956 --> 00:11:22.799
There are no suspects
in custody. Police

186
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.372
are asking anyone to come forward.

187
00:11:24.501 --> 00:11:26.085
Reporting live for Black
TV. White folks are

188
00:11:26.086 --> 00:11:27.668
dead and we're getting
the fuck out of here.

189
00:11:27.796 --> 00:11:28.921
- Let's roll, Jack.
- Right.

190
00:11:28.922 --> 00:11:31.130
Come on. Grab your shit and
let's go, motherfucker.

191
00:11:31.258 --> 00:11:32.966
Go. Go.

192
00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:37.929
Hey, do you think the press
is going to wanna talk to us?

193
00:11:38.057 --> 00:11:40.586
Girl, no. The press
only wants to interview

194
00:11:40.587 --> 00:11:42.885
the most ignorant
person they can find.

195
00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:46.686
I'm on TV. Oh, shit.
First Cops, now this.

196
00:11:46.816 --> 00:11:48.690
Oh, man, I'm going
to be a star, son.

197
00:11:48.818 --> 00:11:53.196
- What can you tell us about Drew?
- Well, she had the phat ass, son.

198
00:11:53.323 --> 00:11:54.624
I mean, it was like bang.

199
00:11:54.625 --> 00:11:56.407
How close were you to the victim?

200
00:11:56.535 --> 00:11:59.239
Real close. Until the
roofies wore off.

201
00:11:59.371 --> 00:12:01.364
Then she woke up talking
about pressing charges.

202
00:12:01.498 --> 00:12:03.574
So I just pulled my tongue
out of her ass and left.

203
00:12:03.709 --> 00:12:05.867
What would have been
your last words to Drew?

204
00:12:06.003 --> 00:12:09.039
Run, bitch. Run.

205
00:12:11.967 --> 00:12:15.633
Hey, yo, dog. Does this
shirt make me look gay?

206
00:12:15.763 --> 00:12:17.554
No, man.

207
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.506
What about now?

208
00:12:21.536 --> 00:12:22.536
Nah.

209
00:12:22.552 --> 00:12:24.393
- Cool?
- Yeah.

210
00:12:24.522 --> 00:12:26.515
Here. Take one, guys. Don't
forget: election's Tuesday.

211
00:12:26.649 --> 00:12:29.436
"Don't forget:
election's Tuesday."

212
00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:33.781
Goddam it. Son of a bitch.

213
00:12:33.907 --> 00:12:36.943
What's the matter, honey?

214
00:12:37.077 --> 00:12:39.034
My report card.

215
00:12:41.498 --> 00:12:44.036
Well, at least you got one "A."

216
00:12:44.167 --> 00:12:47.122
- Yeah. I did, huh?
- Yeah.

217
00:12:47.254 --> 00:12:50.421
You're so smart.

218
00:12:50.549 --> 00:12:53.123
- Hey, has anybody seen Bobby?
- Nah.

219
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.336
You know what? That
kid is always late.

220
00:12:55.471 --> 00:12:57.760
I don't get it. He lives so close.

221
00:12:58.474 --> 00:13:00.550
Why are you

222
00:13:00.685 --> 00:13:02.891
Any better than anyone else

223
00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.813
Why are you so good

224
00:13:07.942 --> 00:13:10.314
- See you later, Hairy Mama...
- Bye, hon. - Bubba, Jim...

225
00:13:10.445 --> 00:13:12.696
Big Jim, Little Jim,
Slim Jim, everybody.

226
00:13:12.697 --> 00:13:13.697
Bye.

227
00:13:13.698 --> 00:13:16.278
I'll see you later.
Ciao, Ding. All right.

228
00:13:22.666 --> 00:13:25.204
Damn, girl.

229
00:13:25.335 --> 00:13:27.425
I'd sure like to
get in them pants.

230
00:13:27.426 --> 00:13:28.426
Really?

231
00:13:28.427 --> 00:13:30.663
Yeah. What size are these?

232
00:13:32.259 --> 00:13:34.168
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Bobby.

233
00:13:34.303 --> 00:13:36.011
Hey, baby.

234
00:13:36.138 --> 00:13:38.298
- How you doing?
- Good.

235
00:13:38.299 --> 00:13:39.794
You guys see all the
reporters out there?

236
00:13:39.795 --> 00:13:40.795
Yeah.

237
00:13:40.796 --> 00:13:42.942
Yeah. Saying that girl Drew
Decker got killed last night.

238
00:13:42.943 --> 00:13:43.943
I know.

239
00:13:43.944 --> 00:13:45.495
You know what? I think I knew her.

240
00:13:45.496 --> 00:13:46.496
Really?

241
00:13:46.497 --> 00:13:48.441
Yeah. She had a
brother named Steve?

242
00:13:48.442 --> 00:13:49.442
Yeah.

243
00:13:49.443 --> 00:13:51.892
Long hair, pretty little
mouth, perfect ass?

244
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.900
- That was her.
- Nah, I was talking about Steve.

245
00:13:55.033 --> 00:13:56.990
Whatever happened to him?

246
00:13:57.118 --> 00:13:59.989
Hey, do you guys think it's
strange that she got killed...

247
00:14:00.121 --> 00:14:03.158
exactly one year after we...

248
00:14:03.291 --> 00:14:05.498
you know, killed that guy?

249
00:14:05.627 --> 00:14:08.201
Hey. Cindy, that was an accident.

250
00:14:08.338 --> 00:14:10.212
Was it, Greg?

251
00:14:14.178 --> 00:14:17.262
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

252
00:14:27.525 --> 00:14:29.648
Would you look at
what they're doing?

253
00:14:29.777 --> 00:14:32.529
When are we going to do
stuff like that, huh?

254
00:14:32.655 --> 00:14:34.529
One day.

255
00:14:34.657 --> 00:14:37.195
- You like that, baby?
- Yeah, that's different.

256
00:14:37.327 --> 00:14:39.569
- You like that?
- Oh, I love that.

257
00:14:39.704 --> 00:14:42.030
Oh, I love when you
play with my ass.

258
00:14:42.165 --> 00:14:44.039
I'm not playing with your ass.

259
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:49.457
- Ray.
- Oh, my bad.

260
00:14:49.589 --> 00:14:54.417
Come on, man. Hey, Bobby,
put on some music.

261
00:14:55.429 --> 00:14:57.671
Hold on. Here, put this on.

262
00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:03.578
Yeah, that's the shit right here.

263
00:15:03.579 --> 00:15:04.886
It's raining men

264
00:15:05.022 --> 00:15:07.727
Hallelujah - It's raining men

265
00:15:07.858 --> 00:15:10.350
- Baby.
- Amen

266
00:15:10.486 --> 00:15:13.156
- I wanna go out - What?
- I'm going to let myself get

267
00:15:13.281 --> 00:15:16.653
- What? It's a classic.
- Absolutely soaking wet.

268
00:15:16.654 --> 00:15:18.406
Turn on the radio, man.

269
00:15:20.914 --> 00:15:23.619
Yeah. Whoo.

270
00:15:36.513 --> 00:15:39.929
- What? It was laundry day.
- What the fuck is...

271
00:15:40.059 --> 00:15:42.098
Yeah.

272
00:15:42.228 --> 00:15:46.177
Whoo. Yeah.

273
00:15:49.026 --> 00:15:52.277
- Hey. Come over here.
- What?

274
00:15:52.405 --> 00:15:53.838
Just get a little closer to me.

275
00:15:53.839 --> 00:15:55.489
Something you're going to tell me?

276
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:59.199
Bobby, what are you doing?

277
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.778
I just want you to touch it.
Just touch it. Come on.

278
00:16:01.915 --> 00:16:04.038
Just a little bit. Come on.

279
00:16:04.167 --> 00:16:07.785
- Whoo.
- Everybody wants you

280
00:16:08.797 --> 00:16:10.754
- Ow.
- Oh.

281
00:16:10.882 --> 00:16:13.208
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

282
00:16:21.477 --> 00:16:24.146
- Bobby.
- Oh, my God. Shit.

283
00:16:26.649 --> 00:16:30.018
God, Cindy... Oh, shit.

284
00:16:41.497 --> 00:16:43.621
Oh, my God. What was that?

285
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.075
I think we hit something.

286
00:16:50.423 --> 00:16:53.175
Oh, man.

287
00:16:53.301 --> 00:16:57.169
Bobby, look at my car, man.
My dad's going to freak.

288
00:16:57.306 --> 00:17:00.010
I didn't see it. It
came out of nowhere.

289
00:17:00.142 --> 00:17:02.680
- Oh, my God, we hit a boot.
- Where's the foot?

290
00:17:02.811 --> 00:17:05.184
I don't know.

291
00:17:05.314 --> 00:17:07.223
Where the...

292
00:17:09.527 --> 00:17:11.899
- It's a body.
- Oh, shit. Is he alive?

293
00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:13.986
- I don't know.
- Well, check it out.

294
00:17:14.115 --> 00:17:15.115
I can't.

295
00:17:15.116 --> 00:17:16.239
- Shit.
- Oh, my God.

296
00:17:16.367 --> 00:17:19.072
- We have to call the police.
- No way. I ain't going to jail.

297
00:17:19.203 --> 00:17:21.113
- We have to.
- Hey, Cindy.

298
00:17:21.247 --> 00:17:23.536
Do you know what they do
to young boys in prison?

299
00:17:23.666 --> 00:17:25.581
You know, all those
sex-starved convicts

300
00:17:25.582 --> 00:17:27.450
just waiting for a
fresh piece of meat.

301
00:17:27.587 --> 00:17:29.794
Hey, you're right, Cindy. Maybe
we should call the police.

302
00:17:29.923 --> 00:17:32.135
Oh, yeah. That's a great
idea, Ray. But what about

303
00:17:32.136 --> 00:17:34.217
Brenda, huh? You think
she wants to go to jail?

304
00:17:34.344 --> 00:17:36.311
This is manslaughter, okay? We're
all going to fry for this.

305
00:17:36.388 --> 00:17:40.089
- We're looking at 10 to 15 years.
- Shut up, Bobby.

306
00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:41.807
- Alcohol all over...
- It's okay. I'm fine.

307
00:17:41.808 --> 00:17:43.143
We're in so much
trouble, you guys.

308
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:44.270
I'm fine.

309
00:17:44.271 --> 00:17:46.224
Don't blame that shit on me, Ray.

310
00:17:46.357 --> 00:17:49.249
Look, we... We'll get
rid of the body.

311
00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:50.307
Unnecessary.

312
00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:52.224
- Now you're thinking.
- We'll dump him in the ocean.

313
00:17:52.225 --> 00:17:53.225
Not the ocean, the pier.

314
00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:55.315
- Guess I'll be leaving now.
- That's a great idea.

315
00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:57.442
- What about the alcohol?
- We'll get rid of it.

316
00:17:57.577 --> 00:17:59.569
Come on. It'll be all right.

317
00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:01.910
- Come on. Hurry up. Let's go.
- Put him in the trunk.

318
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.944
I won't have anything
to do with this.

319
00:18:03.945 --> 00:18:04.945
Shut up.

320
00:18:04.946 --> 00:18:08.078
Cindy, come on. We'll just
pretend it never happened.

321
00:18:08.213 --> 00:18:09.931
You know, like the
time we got drunk

322
00:18:09.932 --> 00:18:11.416
and we went down on each other.

323
00:18:11.527 --> 00:18:12.527
I'll get his arm.

324
00:18:12.528 --> 00:18:15.049
- I'll grab his other arm.
- I'll grab his ass.

325
00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:17.669
We'll take him down to Williamson
Cove and we'll dump him in there.

326
00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:19.964
The sharks'll take
care of the evidence.

327
00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:23.016
Oh, my God, someone's coming.

328
00:18:23.145 --> 00:18:26.146
- Oh, shit. It's Shorty.
- Brenda, take care of him.

329
00:18:32.571 --> 00:18:35.608
Shorty, I know you ain't
driving without no papers.

330
00:18:35.741 --> 00:18:38.826
I got papers, blunts, bongs...

331
00:18:38.953 --> 00:18:41.444
all the ingredients to
make a high nigga pie.

332
00:18:43.249 --> 00:18:46.784
- Hey, yo, can I help you?
- Yo, what's up, Ray?

333
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.627
Yo, son, you all
need jumper cables?

334
00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:49.628
Nah, we're cool.

335
00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:53.634
Oh, good, because I left
my roach clip at home.

336
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.343
- Go home, Shorty.
- Yeah, I'll see you later.

337
00:18:57.472 --> 00:18:59.631
- Peace, Ray.
- Get the trunk closed.

338
00:18:59.766 --> 00:19:02.257
- It won't close.
- I'll do it.

339
00:19:28.463 --> 00:19:32.377
Hold on. Hold on. Put him
down. He's heavy. Oh, God.

340
00:19:32.509 --> 00:19:35.148
Jesus. Okay, look.
On three we dump

341
00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:37.420
him over the ledge, all right?

342
00:19:37.555 --> 00:19:39.963
Wait, wait, wait. Shouldn't
we at least check his wallet?

343
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.683
- For what?
- Shit, he might have some money.

344
00:19:43.812 --> 00:19:46.730
We already committed murder.
We might as well rob his ass.

345
00:19:46.768 --> 00:19:47.768
I'll take the credit cards.

346
00:19:47.769 --> 00:19:49.603
- I want his jewellery.
- I'm going to take his drawers.

347
00:19:50.944 --> 00:19:54.693
Get off. Hey, yo, get off. His
drawers are mine. Hey, yo.

348
00:19:56.242 --> 00:19:58.448
- I got me a gold ring.
- Credit cards.

349
00:19:58.577 --> 00:20:00.627
All right, let's get
him in the water.

350
00:20:00.628 --> 00:20:02.077
I don't think I can, Greg.

351
00:20:02.206 --> 00:20:04.614
- It's not too late.
- Shut up, okay?

352
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.349
Christ, already. I'll do it.

353
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.535
- Come on.
- Just get him in the water.

354
00:20:08.671 --> 00:20:11.875
Okay. One, two...

355
00:20:12.008 --> 00:20:13.882
three.

356
00:20:18.181 --> 00:20:22.345
Right now we make a pact. We
take this to our grave. Agreed?

357
00:20:22.477 --> 00:20:24.269
- Agreed.
- Agreed?

358
00:20:24.396 --> 00:20:28.476
- Agreed.
- Say it, Cindy. Say it.

359
00:20:28.609 --> 00:20:31.693
We take this to our grave. Say it.

360
00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.943
We take this to our grave. Say it.

361
00:20:34.073 --> 00:20:35.781
Greg, chill. Come on.
You're hurting her. Greg.

362
00:20:35.908 --> 00:20:39.324
- Come on.
- We take this to our grave. Ow.

363
00:20:39.453 --> 00:20:43.072
And we never mention this again.

364
00:20:43.207 --> 00:20:46.374
- Mention what?
- The guy we just killed.

365
00:20:46.502 --> 00:20:48.744
Well, you just mentioned it, Greg.

366
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.287
Starting now.

367
00:20:51.424 --> 00:20:54.793
- Stupid bitch, man.
- God, I hate him.

368
00:20:54.928 --> 00:20:58.261
It's going to be okay, baby. It's
going to be okay. I promise.

369
00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.474
Just touch it again.
Come on. Please?

370
00:21:04.354 --> 00:21:07.068
You have to move on, Cindy.
That's all behind us now.

371
00:21:07.069 --> 00:21:08.069
Exactly.

372
00:21:08.108 --> 00:21:10.266
- It's a coincidence.
- Greg's right, Cindy.

373
00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:13.320
I mean, what do you think
we're in, a horror movie?

374
00:21:14.448 --> 00:21:17.117
Yeah, you guys are right.
I mean, if we were...

375
00:21:17.242 --> 00:21:19.691
they'd probably cast
some dingbat like

376
00:21:19.692 --> 00:21:21.952
Jennifer Love Huge
Tits to play me.

377
00:21:22.081 --> 00:21:23.994
Yeah, yeah, or they'd...
or they'd cast people in

378
00:21:23.995 --> 00:21:25.830
their late twenties, early
thirties to play us.

379
00:21:28.754 --> 00:21:31.590
Kenny, get the camera
ready. Here. Hold my gum.

380
00:21:33.926 --> 00:21:36.364
Hi. Sheriff, Sheriff,
can I get a statement?

381
00:21:36.365 --> 00:21:37.365
No comment.

382
00:21:37.366 --> 00:21:42.548
Damn. Who do I have to screw
around here to get a stupid story?

383
00:21:42.686 --> 00:21:45.011
Hey. Hey, no running.

384
00:21:47.232 --> 00:21:49.023
Loser.

385
00:21:49.151 --> 00:21:52.401
- Slow it down.
- Blow me.

386
00:21:52.529 --> 00:21:54.901
All right.

387
00:21:55.032 --> 00:21:57.570
Hi. Gail Hailstorm. Field
Reporter, Hard Story.

388
00:21:57.701 --> 00:21:59.824
Special Officer Doofy.

389
00:21:59.954 --> 00:22:03.903
Oh, hi, Doofy. Doofy, listen.
Is there a problem on campus?

390
00:22:04.041 --> 00:22:06.200
- No comment. - Okay.
- No comment. - Okay.

391
00:22:06.335 --> 00:22:10.000
You know, you look awfully
young to be a police officer.

392
00:22:10.131 --> 00:22:11.750
Yeah, I'm 25 and a half years old.

393
00:22:11.751 --> 00:22:12.751
Ooh.

394
00:22:12.752 --> 00:22:14.667
- Yeah, that's this many.
- Ah, so big.

395
00:22:14.802 --> 00:22:16.676
Yeah. That's big.

396
00:22:16.804 --> 00:22:19.640
Well, you don't
look a day over 12.

397
00:22:19.766 --> 00:22:23.680
Except for the big head and
glazed-over look in your eyes.

398
00:22:23.812 --> 00:22:27.347
- Ooh, was that drool?
- Yeah. I forgot to swallow.

399
00:22:27.482 --> 00:22:30.851
Don't worry, because
I never forget.

400
00:22:32.738 --> 00:22:34.740
Would you remind me
not to do that again?

401
00:22:34.741 --> 00:22:35.741
Sorry.

402
00:22:35.742 --> 00:22:37.028
Hello. Due to the
recent tragedy, the

403
00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:38.367
sheriff and me, your principal...

404
00:22:38.494 --> 00:22:41.032
will be questioning all
students throughout the day.

405
00:22:41.163 --> 00:22:42.718
Wow. Sounds like we've
got the makings

406
00:22:42.719 --> 00:22:44.034
of a serial killer on our hands.

407
00:22:44.166 --> 00:22:46.871
Yeah, I'm not supposed to say.
It's official police business.

408
00:22:47.002 --> 00:22:49.348
Hey, Doofy, what
do you say you and

409
00:22:49.349 --> 00:22:51.499
I go inside my van over there...

410
00:22:51.632 --> 00:22:53.755
and, get to know each
other a little better?

411
00:22:53.885 --> 00:22:55.845
- Would you like that?
- That van?

412
00:22:55.846 --> 00:22:57.633
Yeah, that van right there.

413
00:22:59.182 --> 00:23:02.652
Yeah. Yeah, okay,
let's go. Come on.

414
00:23:02.653 --> 00:23:03.808
Oh.

415
00:23:03.937 --> 00:23:07.685
A terrible tragedy and
an unbearable loss.

416
00:23:07.816 --> 00:23:12.063
It's days like today that
we need prayer in school.

417
00:23:12.195 --> 00:23:17.190
It starts to unravel the very
moral fabric of our society.

418
00:23:17.326 --> 00:23:19.283
Here you go, baby.

419
00:23:19.411 --> 00:23:21.487
You go to your daddy.

420
00:23:25.292 --> 00:23:28.708
- I'll see you after class.
- Sweet. - All right.

421
00:23:28.838 --> 00:23:31.164
Okay, class, who
would like to give

422
00:23:31.165 --> 00:23:33.167
their oral presentation first?

423
00:23:35.178 --> 00:23:37.929
- Anybody?
- Yes.

424
00:23:38.056 --> 00:23:40.973
Anybody else?

425
00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.267
- Okay, Heather.
- Oh, yes. Okay.

426
00:23:46.815 --> 00:23:49.270
- Okay. Can I start?
- Yeah.

427
00:23:49.401 --> 00:23:52.271
Okay, my presentation is
on the First Amendment.

428
00:23:52.404 --> 00:23:56.947
And it began on May 25, 1787 in
Philly with George Washington.

429
00:23:57.075 --> 00:23:58.902
And it states, and I quote...

430
00:23:59.036 --> 00:24:00.679
"When our Founding
Fathers argued the

431
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.452
passage of our glorious
Constitution..."

432
00:24:50.714 --> 00:24:53.052
And so, the First Amendment gives

433
00:24:53.053 --> 00:24:55.673
us the right to say
what we want...

434
00:24:55.803 --> 00:24:58.721
Oh, shut the fuck up.

435
00:24:58.848 --> 00:25:02.098
So, who's next?

436
00:25:02.226 --> 00:25:05.227
Cindy Campbell.

437
00:25:05.355 --> 00:25:08.605
Isn't she the daughter
of, well, you know...

438
00:25:08.733 --> 00:25:12.233
- Oh, yeah, you know, old Mrs...
- Old Mrs...

439
00:25:12.362 --> 00:25:15.197
And, yeah. Yeah, the
one and only...

440
00:25:15.323 --> 00:25:18.692
The one and only.

441
00:25:18.827 --> 00:25:22.445
- Why, hello, Cindy.
- Hi, Principal Squiggman.

442
00:25:22.581 --> 00:25:23.926
Thanks, Doofy.

443
00:25:23.927 --> 00:25:27.539
It's Special Officer
Doofy today, Cind.

444
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:29.508
Now, Cindy, Sheriff
has some questions

445
00:25:29.509 --> 00:25:31.252
that he would like
to ask you today.

446
00:25:31.382 --> 00:25:33.844
What is that, that
god-awful smell?

447
00:25:33.845 --> 00:25:34.881
I don't know.

448
00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:36.291
I got a poopie.

449
00:25:37.513 --> 00:25:40.384
Did you just say that
you, you went poopie?

450
00:25:40.516 --> 00:25:43.553
- Yeah. It was good.
- Mm.

451
00:25:43.686 --> 00:25:46.771
- Get him out of here.
- Yes.

452
00:25:46.898 --> 00:25:49.603
- Thank you, Doofy.
- Okay.

453
00:25:49.734 --> 00:25:51.893
You should now go
back to Special Ed.

454
00:25:52.028 --> 00:25:53.243
Okay. Salute.

455
00:25:53.244 --> 00:25:56.240
Maybe a change of underwear, son.

456
00:25:56.366 --> 00:25:58.904
- Bye, Doofy.
- Bye, Cind.

457
00:25:59.828 --> 00:26:01.785
- How are you, Cindy?
- Fine.

458
00:26:01.913 --> 00:26:04.784
- How are you, Sheriff?
- Bloated, constipated.

459
00:26:04.917 --> 00:26:08.451
Got a boil on my ass the size of
a walnut. You know, the usual.

460
00:26:08.587 --> 00:26:11.458
Cindy, I want to ask you some
questions about Drew Decker.

461
00:26:13.008 --> 00:26:16.009
- I didn't really know her.
- Oh, come on. Sure you do.

462
00:26:16.137 --> 00:26:17.236
- No. I mean...
- Come on.

463
00:26:17.237 --> 00:26:18.462
I didn't really know her.

464
00:26:18.597 --> 00:26:20.098
I've been in this game
a long time. Don't

465
00:26:20.099 --> 00:26:21.349
bullshit a bullshitter, all right?

466
00:26:21.475 --> 00:26:25.853
Tell me about Drew. What was
she like in bed, Cindy?

467
00:26:27.065 --> 00:26:30.184
Tried to get you. It's
an old police trick.

468
00:26:30.318 --> 00:26:32.194
It's an old police
trick. You didn't

469
00:26:32.195 --> 00:26:33.817
fall for it. Good for you, kid.

470
00:26:33.947 --> 00:26:35.821
Hike.

471
00:26:36.825 --> 00:26:39.316
Pass. Pass.

472
00:26:42.706 --> 00:26:44.864
- All right, shower up.
- Yes.

473
00:26:46.293 --> 00:26:49.792
Yo, Dugan, man, nice
play, yo. Word up.

474
00:26:49.922 --> 00:26:51.696
Johnson, what a block,
baby. Word up.

475
00:26:51.697 --> 00:26:52.697
Thanks a lot, kid.

476
00:26:52.758 --> 00:26:53.758
Woodward.

477
00:26:53.759 --> 00:26:55.962
- Hey. Hey.
- Nice ass.

478
00:26:56.095 --> 00:26:58.171
Damn.

479
00:26:58.305 --> 00:27:01.639
Hey, yo, Greg, man, what's up? You
going to hit the showers or what?

480
00:27:01.767 --> 00:27:04.029
No, man. I think I'm
going to work out,

481
00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:05.896
you know, beat the bag a little.

482
00:27:06.022 --> 00:27:08.145
Suit yourself, kid.
All right. Last

483
00:27:08.146 --> 00:27:10.150
one in the shower's a rotten egg.

484
00:27:10.276 --> 00:27:14.144
Come on, you all. I'm
going to get you all.

485
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:17.198
Don't let Uncle Ray catch you.

486
00:27:40.432 --> 00:27:44.727
Who did this? Huh? Where are you?

487
00:27:44.854 --> 00:27:47.143
This isn't funny, all right?

488
00:27:47.273 --> 00:27:50.191
A small dick's like
a disability, man.

489
00:27:50.318 --> 00:27:54.529
Huh? Would you make fun of a guy
in a wheelchair? Huh? Would you?

490
00:27:54.656 --> 00:27:57.028
Come on out here, you sick fuck.

491
00:27:57.158 --> 00:28:01.203
I'll kick the shit out of
you right now. All right?

492
00:28:01.329 --> 00:28:03.097
It's not the size of the hammer,

493
00:28:03.098 --> 00:28:05.197
it's the nail you're
throwing it at.

494
00:28:08.211 --> 00:28:11.746
It's a shame how she died, you
know? She was such a nice girl.

495
00:28:11.882 --> 00:28:14.836
Yeah, she used to baby-sit
my brother Doofy.

496
00:28:14.968 --> 00:28:18.587
- He had the biggest crush on her.
- Ray, you're a dead man.

497
00:28:18.722 --> 00:28:20.448
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

498
00:28:20.449 --> 00:28:21.682
No, no, no,
what you trying to say?

499
00:28:21.684 --> 00:28:22.962
You wanna get
butt-naked and wrestle?

500
00:28:22.963 --> 00:28:24.030
Chill out. Chill out. Chill out.

501
00:28:24.031 --> 00:28:25.462
- Bring it on, Ray.
- Hold my earrings.

502
00:28:25.463 --> 00:28:26.802
- Chill out.
- Where's my Vaseline?

503
00:28:26.831 --> 00:28:28.783
- Take it easy.
- What's the problem?

504
00:28:28.784 --> 00:28:30.349
I'll show you the problem.

505
00:28:30.485 --> 00:28:32.561
Oh... That's you?

506
00:28:32.695 --> 00:28:36.230
They... They turned the hot water
off in the showers, all right?

507
00:28:37.617 --> 00:28:40.404
Oh, shit.

508
00:28:40.537 --> 00:28:43.740
Oh, yeah. Laugh it up,
you guys. Big laugh.

509
00:28:45.375 --> 00:28:47.831
You know what? You
can all go to hell.

510
00:28:47.961 --> 00:28:51.247
Greg, you're not the
only one who got one.

511
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:54.672
Oh, you mean Bobby's
got a baby dick too?

512
00:28:57.304 --> 00:28:59.878
No. I was talking about the note.

513
00:29:00.015 --> 00:29:02.257
I got one too.

514
00:29:02.393 --> 00:29:05.144
- Somebody knows.
- That's bullshit, Cindy.

515
00:29:05.271 --> 00:29:07.263
Look, someone's just trying
to fuck with us, you guys.

516
00:29:07.398 --> 00:29:10.019
We have to call the police, Greg.

517
00:29:10.151 --> 00:29:12.820
You call the police, and
I'll kill you myself.

518
00:29:20.787 --> 00:29:21.993
You're hurting her, man.

519
00:29:21.994 --> 00:29:24.452
And you know what? That
goes for all of you guys.

520
00:29:24.582 --> 00:29:27.156
That psycho wants a piece
of me, bring it on.

521
00:29:27.294 --> 00:29:30.413
But I'm not going to
jail. You got that?

522
00:29:38.555 --> 00:29:40.631
What's everybody talking about?

523
00:29:40.766 --> 00:29:43.222
Just forget it, Shorty. You
already know too much.

524
00:29:47.606 --> 00:29:50.014
Aren't they beautiful?

525
00:29:50.151 --> 00:29:53.152
- Buffy.
- Contestant number one.

526
00:29:56.282 --> 00:29:59.734
Very good. And
contestant number two.

527
00:30:03.665 --> 00:30:06.370
Very good. And
contestant number three.

528
00:30:06.501 --> 00:30:10.166
- Buffy.
- That's my girl.

529
00:30:10.297 --> 00:30:13.547
- That's my girlfriend.
- Yeah, that's my girlfriend too.

530
00:30:13.675 --> 00:30:16.925
- Hey, kiss my ass.
- Yeah, I'm hitting that too.

531
00:30:17.054 --> 00:30:19.545
- All right, Buffy.
- Hey, shut the hell up, man.

532
00:30:19.681 --> 00:30:21.692
Oh, yeah, man. Best
pussy I ever had.

533
00:30:21.693 --> 00:30:23.300
What, you want a piece of me?

534
00:30:23.435 --> 00:30:25.761
Now the talent portion
of the competition.

535
00:30:25.896 --> 00:30:27.925
Oh, you guys, I'm going to go
downstairs for a closer seat.

536
00:30:27.926 --> 00:30:28.926
Let's begin...

537
00:30:28.927 --> 00:30:30.784
with contestant number three...

538
00:30:30.785 --> 00:30:33.395
See you after the
show. Buffy Gilmore.

539
00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.914
Hey, you know what? I'm
going to go, hit the

540
00:30:34.915 --> 00:30:36.382
head. You want me to
bring you back anything?

541
00:30:36.383 --> 00:30:37.677
No, no, no. I'm good,
man. But hurry

542
00:30:37.678 --> 00:30:38.742
back. She's going to perform.

543
00:30:38.868 --> 00:30:41.441
- Don't worry. I'll be back.
- So, good evening, Buffy.

544
00:30:41.579 --> 00:30:43.702
And what will be your
talent for this evening?

545
00:30:43.831 --> 00:30:47.580
Acting. I'll be doing
a dramatic reading.

546
00:30:50.046 --> 00:30:52.039
Buffy Gilmore doing
a dramatic reading.

547
00:30:53.925 --> 00:30:57.425
Hey, do that thing from Baywatch.
She's running down the beach.

548
00:31:04.353 --> 00:31:06.392
Look out, Greg. Look behind you.

549
00:31:08.023 --> 00:31:10.728
- It's him. It's the killer.
- Huh?

550
00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.777
Oh, my God. Somebody do something.

551
00:31:13.904 --> 00:31:17.404
Somebody do something.

552
00:31:17.533 --> 00:31:20.107
He's killing him.

553
00:31:20.244 --> 00:31:23.162
- He's killing him.
- Must be an original piece.

554
00:31:23.289 --> 00:31:24.570
He's killing him.

555
00:31:26.501 --> 00:31:28.244
She's good. She's good.

556
00:31:28.378 --> 00:31:31.248
- What's wrong with you people?
- That's fantastic.

557
00:31:31.381 --> 00:31:34.884
You fucking bastards.
Why won't anyone help?

558
00:31:34.885 --> 00:31:35.885
Amazing.

559
00:31:35.905 --> 00:31:37.461
- She's the next Pamela Lee.
- God.

560
00:31:37.596 --> 00:31:40.680
Oh, God. Oh, God. Don't.

561
00:31:41.683 --> 00:31:44.305
Greg, hold on.

562
00:31:45.896 --> 00:31:48.304
Give it up for Buffy
Gilmore. Wonderful.

563
00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.516
Absolutely fantastic.

564
00:31:53.737 --> 00:31:57.782
I think we have a winner, ladies
and gentlemen. Miss Buffy Gilmore.

565
00:31:57.908 --> 00:32:00.447
Buffy, wait. You have
to go back onstage.

566
00:32:00.578 --> 00:32:02.867
- No. I have to get to Greg.
- But you won.

567
00:32:02.997 --> 00:32:04.631
- They're calling your name.
- There's a killer...

568
00:32:06.542 --> 00:32:08.500
- I won?
- They're calling your name. Go.

569
00:32:08.628 --> 00:32:10.416
Buffy, what happened?
What about Greg?

570
00:32:10.417 --> 00:32:11.463
Oh, fuck Greg. I won.

571
00:32:11.589 --> 00:32:13.665
- Congratulations.
- Oh, out of my way, loser.

572
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.251
Miss Buffy Gilmore.

573
00:32:17.387 --> 00:32:21.681
Here she comes Miss
Teen She's So Fine

574
00:32:21.808 --> 00:32:24.809
Such lovely tits -
Give me my crown, bitch.

575
00:32:24.937 --> 00:32:28.056
And a great behind

576
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:33.148
There she is Doggy style anytime

577
00:32:33.279 --> 00:32:37.490
And I'll do her behind
behind and behind

578
00:32:37.616 --> 00:32:40.487
Oh, there she is

579
00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:43.989
She loves 69

580
00:32:44.123 --> 00:32:47.492
- There's no sign of him anywhere.
- He could've taken the body.

581
00:32:47.627 --> 00:32:49.104
That's impossible,
Cindy. There's no

582
00:32:49.105 --> 00:32:50.581
blood. There's nothing.
Look around.

583
00:32:50.713 --> 00:32:53.584
I bet it's just Greg playing
another one of his dumb jokes.

584
00:32:53.716 --> 00:32:56.124
He's going to turn up. I'm sure of
it. He's probably at my house...

585
00:32:56.261 --> 00:32:58.799
waiting for us right
now, you guys.

586
00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:00.615
All right, fine, fine.
But you know what?

587
00:33:00.616 --> 00:33:02.299
I'm going to look
around some more, so...

588
00:33:02.434 --> 00:33:04.090
You mind catching a
ride home with Buffy?

589
00:33:04.091 --> 00:33:05.091
Yeah, no problem.

590
00:33:05.092 --> 00:33:07.350
- All right, fine.
- Call me later.

591
00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.837
- Hello?
- Hello, Cindy.

592
00:33:31.965 --> 00:33:34.716
- Who is this?
- It's me, Bobby.

593
00:33:34.843 --> 00:33:37.298
You know, your boyfriend.

594
00:33:37.429 --> 00:33:41.426
Yeah, I'm sorry. I guess
I'm a little jumpy lately.

595
00:33:41.558 --> 00:33:44.512
- Hey, any sign of Greg?
- No.

596
00:33:44.644 --> 00:33:47.848
- Do you want me to come by?
- No.

597
00:33:47.981 --> 00:33:51.600
I'm just going to take a bath,
and then I'm going to go to bed.

598
00:33:51.735 --> 00:33:55.567
Okay. I'd really like to see
you, but... I love you.

599
00:33:55.698 --> 00:33:59.067
Aw. I love you too, baby.

600
00:34:21.558 --> 00:34:23.432
Bobby, I told you...

601
00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.802
I still know what you
did last Halloween.

602
00:34:25.937 --> 00:34:27.597
Who is this?

603
00:34:40.369 --> 00:34:43.156
Ow. Ow.

604
00:34:47.627 --> 00:34:49.833
- Hello.
- I'm going to kill you.

605
00:34:49.962 --> 00:34:52.204
- I'm going to slice you up.
- Who is this?

606
00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.918
I'm going to chop you like liver.

607
00:34:53.919 --> 00:34:54.919
What do you want?

608
00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:57.298
I'm in the house.

609
00:34:57.428 --> 00:34:59.801
Do you know where I am?

610
00:35:02.434 --> 00:35:06.348
I could be anywhere. I'm
like the wind, baby.

611
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.646
Yeah. Where am I?

612
00:35:12.027 --> 00:35:14.732
You're-you're behind the couch.

613
00:35:16.865 --> 00:35:20.484
- What? How do you know that?
- I can, see your feet.

614
00:35:22.413 --> 00:35:25.829
Ah. Okay, turn around.

615
00:35:25.958 --> 00:35:28.165
Close your eyes. No peeking.

616
00:35:32.507 --> 00:35:36.836
Yeah. No. No. No.

617
00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:39.840
Hey, hey, hey. No peeking.
No peeking. Turn around.

618
00:35:39.973 --> 00:35:41.550
Good.

619
00:35:41.683 --> 00:35:43.722
Okay, now you can look.

620
00:35:43.852 --> 00:35:47.552
Now do you know where
I am? You don't.

621
00:35:47.689 --> 00:35:50.809
No, Mr Killer. I don't
know where you are.

622
00:35:50.942 --> 00:35:53.813
I'll give you a big clue.

623
00:35:56.824 --> 00:35:59.112
Oh. I got to stop drinking.

624
00:36:06.041 --> 00:36:09.457
- Grandma.
- Ow, baby. Ow. Ow. Oh, my hip.

625
00:36:33.111 --> 00:36:34.736
Come on.

626
00:36:41.036 --> 00:36:43.408
White woman in trouble
off the 744...

627
00:36:50.379 --> 00:36:51.674
- Are you okay?
- Oh, my God.

628
00:36:51.675 --> 00:36:53.416
I heard screaming.
What's going on?

629
00:36:53.549 --> 00:36:55.838
Bobby, he was here.

630
00:36:55.968 --> 00:36:59.337
- The killer was here, Bobby.
- It's okay.

631
00:37:06.479 --> 00:37:10.098
- I can explain that.
- Oh, my God.

632
00:37:10.233 --> 00:37:13.104
A friend gave them
to me. Cindy. Cindy.

633
00:37:13.862 --> 00:37:16.531
Cindy. Cindy. Cindy.

634
00:37:16.656 --> 00:37:18.530
Cindy. Cindy.

635
00:37:23.414 --> 00:37:25.453
It's me, Cind.

636
00:37:25.582 --> 00:37:28.156
Cindy, you know me. Cindy.

637
00:37:34.717 --> 00:37:37.208
I know you've had a rough night,
Cindy, so I won't keep you.

638
00:37:37.345 --> 00:37:40.132
I just want you to look at some
photos. Tell me what you think.

639
00:37:50.358 --> 00:37:53.312
- No?
- No.

640
00:37:53.445 --> 00:37:57.443
- I'm sorry, Sheriff.
- You sure?

641
00:37:57.574 --> 00:38:00.492
Okay, you're free to go. Do you
have somebody picking you up?

642
00:38:00.619 --> 00:38:02.695
- Yeah.
- Oh. Just...

643
00:38:04.248 --> 00:38:06.205
Just check that one out again.

644
00:38:07.626 --> 00:38:08.875
Mm, no.

645
00:38:08.876 --> 00:38:12.621
No? No? All right. Well, worth
a shot. All right, thanks.

646
00:38:12.756 --> 00:38:14.687
Guess what I just did with
those hookers we busted.

647
00:38:14.688 --> 00:38:15.688
No way.

648
00:38:15.689 --> 00:38:18.552
All the way, man. Yes, yes.
Watch this. Watch this. Doofy.

649
00:38:18.679 --> 00:38:20.921
- Yeah?
- Come on. Come on.

650
00:38:21.057 --> 00:38:22.516
Okay.

651
00:38:23.518 --> 00:38:25.510
Special Officer Doofy reporting.

652
00:38:25.645 --> 00:38:28.101
Hey, Doofy, smell my fingers.

653
00:38:29.253 --> 00:38:30.253
What's that?

654
00:38:30.254 --> 00:38:32.940
That's when you know you've
become a man, Doofy.

655
00:38:33.945 --> 00:38:36.021
Hey, Terry, smell my finger.

656
00:38:36.156 --> 00:38:38.777
- What the hell is that?
- My ass.

657
00:38:38.909 --> 00:38:40.948
- Get the hell out of here, Doofy.
- Doofy.

658
00:38:41.078 --> 00:38:42.745
Mum said get home now.

659
00:38:42.746 --> 00:38:45.870
Tell Mum I'm on official
police business.

660
00:38:45.999 --> 00:38:47.214
Cindy, are you okay?

661
00:38:47.215 --> 00:38:49.700
Hey, hey, hey. No
talking to the witness.

662
00:38:49.837 --> 00:38:51.917
Go get in the car, Doofy.
She's coming with us.

663
00:38:51.918 --> 00:38:53.756
- Does Mum know?
- Yeah, Doofus.

664
00:38:53.757 --> 00:38:55.711
Mum says when I wear this badge...

665
00:38:55.843 --> 00:38:57.670
you're supposed to treat
me like a man of the law.

666
00:38:57.803 --> 00:38:59.553
Yeah, well, Mum also
said for you to stop

667
00:38:59.554 --> 00:39:01.303
sticking your dick in
the vacuum cleaner.

668
00:39:04.977 --> 00:39:06.804
Okay, three, two...

669
00:39:06.938 --> 00:39:08.644
- Oh, no. Gosh darn.
- What now?

670
00:39:08.674 --> 00:39:10.542
No, it's just that there's all
these numbers with deci...

671
00:39:10.543 --> 00:39:11.581
What, can't you count?

672
00:39:11.582 --> 00:39:12.910
No, I can count, but
there's really...

673
00:39:12.911 --> 00:39:15.102
Here, let me make it easy for you.
Chump-zilla, listen up, okay?

674
00:39:15.103 --> 00:39:16.784
This little piggy went
to the market. All

675
00:39:16.785 --> 00:39:18.305
right? This little
piggy stayed home.

676
00:39:18.366 --> 00:39:20.300
Now, if this little piggy doesn't
roll the goddam camera...

677
00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:22.094
I'm going to put my foot
up his fucking ass...

678
00:39:22.095 --> 00:39:23.095
We're live, Gail.

679
00:39:23.096 --> 00:39:25.119
Gail Hailstorm standing out
front of the police station...

680
00:39:25.249 --> 00:39:27.870
where I'm going to try and get
a glimpse of Cindy Campbell...

681
00:39:28.001 --> 00:39:30.457
the young girl who was
attacked earlier this evening.

682
00:39:30.587 --> 00:39:31.625
You're on my foot, fat shit.

683
00:39:31.627 --> 00:39:32.922
- Sorry, G...
- What did I say?

684
00:39:32.923 --> 00:39:33.923
Huh? What did I say?

685
00:39:33.936 --> 00:39:35.457
"Don't... Don't ever
step on Gail's shoes."

686
00:39:35.458 --> 00:39:36.966
- Why not?
- Because Gail wears Prada shoes.

687
00:39:37.094 --> 00:39:39.087
- You idiot.
- I'm a... I'm a bad man.

688
00:39:39.221 --> 00:39:40.488
- Cindy. Cindy.
- How about one minute?

689
00:39:40.489 --> 00:39:42.015
Cindy, can we get a statement?

690
00:39:42.016 --> 00:39:44.305
Buffy Gilmore, Miss Teen.
She's not talking.

691
00:39:44.435 --> 00:39:46.392
Is it true the police
have someone in custody?

692
00:39:46.521 --> 00:39:47.582
Come on, Cindy.

693
00:39:47.583 --> 00:39:49.890
Cindy, Cindy, your ass looks fat.

694
00:39:51.901 --> 00:39:54.108
Bitch.

695
00:39:54.237 --> 00:39:56.360
- Good shot.
- Come on.

696
00:39:56.489 --> 00:39:59.490
- All right, who copped a feel?
- Gail, it was me.

697
00:39:59.618 --> 00:40:02.702
- Oh, my God.
- It was an accident, Gail.

698
00:40:02.829 --> 00:40:05.700
I only touched it, the
top of the breast.

699
00:40:05.832 --> 00:40:07.706
- It was so tender and juicy.
- Shut up.

700
00:40:16.769 --> 00:40:17.769
Yo.

701
00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:20.296
Hello, Shorty. What are you doing?

702
00:40:20.431 --> 00:40:25.674
Nothing. Sitting here watching
the game. Smoking some bud.

703
00:40:27.188 --> 00:40:29.145
Are you all alone?

704
00:40:29.273 --> 00:40:32.974
- Wassup?
- Wassup?

705
00:40:33.111 --> 00:40:35.483
What the... Who's that?

706
00:40:35.613 --> 00:40:38.401
Yo, pick up the phone.

707
00:40:38.533 --> 00:40:41.534
- Wassup?
- Wassup?

708
00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:46.202
Yo, Dookie, pick up the phone.

709
00:40:47.334 --> 00:40:49.659
- Yo.
- Wassup?

710
00:40:58.512 --> 00:41:04.183
- So what you doing, son?
- Nothing. Just chilling, killing.

711
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:06.848
True. True.

712
00:41:07.063 --> 00:41:08.890
So you think Bobby did it?

713
00:41:12.318 --> 00:41:15.604
I don't know. But he
was there, Buffy.

714
00:41:15.738 --> 00:41:19.736
I knew there had to be something.
He's just too perfect.

715
00:41:19.868 --> 00:41:24.079
Handsome, smart, good in bed.

716
00:41:24.206 --> 00:41:27.539
What did you say?

717
00:41:27.667 --> 00:41:30.752
Hey, Cind. Got your ice
pack for your hand.

718
00:41:30.879 --> 00:41:33.584
- Ow.
- Sorry.

719
00:41:33.715 --> 00:41:36.253
I'll get you one for your head.

720
00:41:36.385 --> 00:41:38.710
No, no, that's okay, Doofy.

721
00:41:38.846 --> 00:41:43.307
Hey, we're going to get that guy
you dumped in the water. Yeah.

722
00:41:43.434 --> 00:41:45.427
I'll be next door if you need me.

723
00:41:45.561 --> 00:41:48.895
Night, Cind.

724
00:41:49.023 --> 00:41:50.434
Buffy, you told him?

725
00:41:50.566 --> 00:41:53.603
The moron overheard a conversation
Greg and I were having.

726
00:41:53.736 --> 00:41:55.362
Yeah, but what if
he says something?

727
00:41:55.363 --> 00:41:57.864
Who's going to believe a
retarded retard like him anyway?

728
00:41:57.991 --> 00:41:59.734
Don't worry.

729
00:41:59.868 --> 00:42:01.445
Cindy, telephone.

730
00:42:03.705 --> 00:42:05.579
Thank you.

731
00:42:05.707 --> 00:42:09.290
- Hello?
- Hello, Cindy.

732
00:42:09.419 --> 00:42:11.459
- Guess what.
- No.

733
00:42:11.588 --> 00:42:13.628
- You got the wrong guy.
- No.

734
00:42:13.757 --> 00:42:15.631
- Yep. It's not Bobby.
- Doofy?

735
00:42:15.759 --> 00:42:18.297
- Who is this?
- Doofy. Doofy.

736
00:42:18.429 --> 00:42:20.670
- Doofy.
- Oh, my God.

737
00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:29.308
Hello?

738
00:42:30.691 --> 00:42:32.850
Hello?

739
00:42:32.985 --> 00:42:36.817
I said don't disturb me
when I'm cleaning my room.

740
00:42:42.745 --> 00:42:45.237
I heard Bobby got
out this morning.

741
00:42:45.373 --> 00:42:48.623
I haven't seen him
around. Is he pissed?

742
00:42:48.752 --> 00:42:52.500
You mean since you branded him the
Candyman? No. His heart is broken.

743
00:42:52.631 --> 00:42:55.715
Yo, son. It's like I
seen this all before.

744
00:42:55.842 --> 00:42:57.800
They had a killer at your
old high school, Shorty?

745
00:42:57.928 --> 00:43:01.095
No, it was in this movie Scream.
Same dialogue and everything.

746
00:43:01.223 --> 00:43:03.465
- This is ill.
- How did it end?

747
00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.753
I don't know. Some niggas
started shooting up

748
00:43:05.754 --> 00:43:07.812
in the movie theatre,
so we just broke out.

749
00:43:07.855 --> 00:43:08.855
No doubt.

750
00:43:08.856 --> 00:43:11.604
Okay, I say we all
just stick together.

751
00:43:11.734 --> 00:43:14.486
Tonight everyone meet at my
house. And bring some friends.

752
00:43:14.612 --> 00:43:17.233
But don't tell everyone,
okay? Try to keep it quiet.

753
00:43:17.365 --> 00:43:21.279
Okay. Yo. Party at Cindy's house.

754
00:43:21.411 --> 00:43:24.080
Drunk white women for everybody.

755
00:43:25.665 --> 00:43:30.623
Ray, if you see Bobby,
tell him I love him.

756
00:43:30.754 --> 00:43:34.704
Okay. If I see Bobby,
I'll tell him I love him.

757
00:43:41.388 --> 00:43:42.388
Jesus.

758
00:43:42.389 --> 00:43:44.256
It's okay. It's all right.
It's just me, baby.

759
00:43:45.236 --> 00:43:46.704
What, you don't still
think it's me, do you?

760
00:43:46.705 --> 00:43:47.705
No.

761
00:43:47.721 --> 00:43:49.278
It's just that somebody
did try to kill me.

762
00:43:49.279 --> 00:43:50.279
Yeah.

763
00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:52.049
And the police said
I scared him away.

764
00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:54.026
I know. He called me last night.

765
00:43:54.153 --> 00:43:55.838
Yeah, so you see, it
couldn't have been

766
00:43:55.839 --> 00:43:57.522
me. I was in jail
last night. Remember?

767
00:43:59.826 --> 00:44:01.735
You're the best.

768
00:44:01.869 --> 00:44:04.277
I'm sorry. Please understand.

769
00:44:04.414 --> 00:44:05.859
Understand what? That
my girlfriend would

770
00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:07.201
rather call me a
killer than touch me?

771
00:44:07.333 --> 00:44:08.333
That's not true, Bobby.

772
00:44:08.334 --> 00:44:09.623
- Then what is it?
- What is it?

773
00:44:09.753 --> 00:44:11.855
She's gone and she's
not coming back.

774
00:44:11.856 --> 00:44:13.537
It's been over a year, Cindy.

775
00:44:13.673 --> 00:44:16.247
But Ginger was such an important
part of the Spice Girls.

776
00:44:16.384 --> 00:44:19.339
- Oh, you got to move on, baby.
- Oh.

777
00:44:19.471 --> 00:44:22.425
I am sorry if my
complicated life...

778
00:44:22.558 --> 00:44:26.602
is an inconvenience to
your perfect existence.

779
00:44:26.729 --> 00:44:29.564
Cindy. Cind.

780
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:31.730
Okay, everybody, listen up.

781
00:44:31.859 --> 00:44:34.101
Let me just say...

782
00:44:34.236 --> 00:44:38.899
the killing of these... these
teenagers has been tragic, but...

783
00:44:39.033 --> 00:44:40.897
Hey, you know, shit happens.

784
00:44:40.899 --> 00:44:44.076
- Sheriff.
- Sheriff.

785
00:44:44.205 --> 00:44:45.366
Yes, Miss Thunderstorm.

786
00:44:45.367 --> 00:44:47.408
Have they found Cindy
Campbell's father?

787
00:44:47.542 --> 00:44:49.582
- No.
- Isn't he a suspect?

788
00:44:49.711 --> 00:44:51.787
That is classified information.
Where are you getting that?

789
00:44:51.921 --> 00:44:55.622
I'm sorry, but, my sources are
strictly confidential, Sheriff.

790
00:44:55.759 --> 00:44:58.250
Hey, Gail.

791
00:44:58.386 --> 00:45:01.637
Gail swallows.

792
00:45:07.146 --> 00:45:09.019
Watch this.

793
00:45:10.316 --> 00:45:13.270
Hello? Who is this?

794
00:45:14.445 --> 00:45:18.194
What? You wanna kill me?

795
00:45:18.324 --> 00:45:20.447
Oh, God. Hold on.

796
00:45:20.576 --> 00:45:24.621
Cindy, it's for you.

797
00:45:26.791 --> 00:45:29.080
All right, knock it off, Buffy.

798
00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:32.045
Now, as you all have heard, there
is a killer in our town...

799
00:45:32.172 --> 00:45:33.670
and the police have asked us to

800
00:45:33.671 --> 00:45:35.457
give you the following
safety tips.

801
00:45:35.592 --> 00:45:37.798
Stay in well-lit areas.

802
00:45:37.928 --> 00:45:39.785
Do not travel alone whenever

803
00:45:39.786 --> 00:45:42.305
possible. Always
wipe front to back.

804
00:45:42.432 --> 00:45:45.469
And remember, never,
ever believe someone...

805
00:45:45.602 --> 00:45:48.307
when they tell you that
shaving your pubic hair...

806
00:45:48.439 --> 00:45:51.309
will rid you of crab infestation.

807
00:45:51.442 --> 00:45:53.730
Now, I understand
this is a difficult

808
00:45:53.731 --> 00:45:55.356
time for you young ladies.

809
00:45:55.488 --> 00:45:58.489
So if anyone needs to come
to my office to talk...

810
00:45:58.616 --> 00:46:00.608
I am here for you.

811
00:46:04.789 --> 00:46:07.992
- What a crock of shit.
- It's not, Buffy.

812
00:46:08.126 --> 00:46:10.996
He's real.

813
00:46:20.639 --> 00:46:23.924
Miss Mann?

814
00:46:24.059 --> 00:46:27.345
Come in, dear. Have a seat. Take
off your bra if you'd like.

815
00:46:29.398 --> 00:46:31.853
No, thanks.

816
00:46:31.984 --> 00:46:34.060
What can I do for you, Cindy?

817
00:46:34.194 --> 00:46:37.895
I need to talk. See, I
have this problem...

818
00:46:38.032 --> 00:46:41.531
and I don't know who to tell.

819
00:46:41.661 --> 00:46:44.864
- Not feeling so fresh?
- Huh?

820
00:46:44.997 --> 00:46:47.370
Feminine odour and
itching got you down?

821
00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:50.536
No. No, not that.

822
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:54.584
Then what is it?

823
00:46:54.716 --> 00:46:57.207
I have a terrible secret.

824
00:46:57.343 --> 00:47:00.261
Well, Cindy, we all have
our little secrets.

825
00:47:03.308 --> 00:47:05.716
Sometimes we do things
we're not so proud of.

826
00:47:05.852 --> 00:47:08.723
Some for money...

827
00:47:08.855 --> 00:47:12.022
others to gain the athletic
edge on the competition.

828
00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:16.065
Sometimes those secrets
come back to haunt us.

829
00:47:16.196 --> 00:47:20.029
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yes, I do, Miss Mann.

830
00:47:20.159 --> 00:47:23.030
Thanks for ball... I
mean, all your help.

831
00:47:23.162 --> 00:47:26.412
I have to go to class.

832
00:47:26.541 --> 00:47:28.617
Anytime, dear.

833
00:47:31.087 --> 00:47:32.300
Buffy, are you coming?

834
00:47:32.301 --> 00:47:34.373
I'll catch up with
you guys in a sec.

835
00:47:40.347 --> 00:47:43.217
Redrum.

836
00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:45.223
Hello?

837
00:47:52.401 --> 00:47:55.485
Somebody there?

838
00:47:55.612 --> 00:47:57.486
Hello.

839
00:48:03.621 --> 00:48:06.824
Very funny. Who put you
up to this? Cindy?

840
00:48:06.958 --> 00:48:09.531
Lose the cape. It's
way too '90s horror.

841
00:48:11.921 --> 00:48:16.049
Oh, so what movie is this
from, Die, Cheerleader, Die?

842
00:48:18.261 --> 00:48:23.053
Wanna play psycho killer? Can I
be the helpless cheerleader?

843
00:48:24.851 --> 00:48:27.473
Oh, so this is where I'm
supposed to beg for my life?

844
00:48:28.605 --> 00:48:31.559
Please, Mr Killer, don't kill me.

845
00:48:35.445 --> 00:48:38.316
So is this where I'm
supposed to bleed?

846
00:48:38.449 --> 00:48:42.197
Oh, look, I'm bleeding. Eek. Eek.

847
00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:46.700
Oh, yeah, I'm supposed
to run, right?

848
00:48:46.832 --> 00:48:51.494
Okay. I'm running.
I'm running. Help.

849
00:48:51.629 --> 00:48:54.119
Help. Oh. Now I'm
going to fall and

850
00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:56.540
break my leg, leaving me helpless.

851
00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:03.928
There you go, Mr Scary
Killer. I'm panicking now.

852
00:49:04.059 --> 00:49:08.270
Oh, God. Somebody please help me.

853
00:49:08.396 --> 00:49:10.555
Oh, God, no.

854
00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:13.016
No.

855
00:49:13.151 --> 00:49:15.559
Oh, now what?

856
00:49:15.696 --> 00:49:21.283
I guess this is the big climax.
Hope you don't mind if I fake it.

857
00:49:24.538 --> 00:49:26.661
Oh, look at me. I'm all dead.

858
00:49:26.791 --> 00:49:30.290
I'm a gross, scary severed
head. Come on. Please.

859
00:49:30.419 --> 00:49:32.421
Do you know who I
am? I'm Miss Teen.

860
00:49:32.422 --> 00:49:34.369
You're really giving
me a headache.

861
00:49:34.507 --> 00:49:36.629
And you got blood all
over my Gucci sweater.

862
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:38.374
I hope you're going
to pay for that.

863
00:49:38.511 --> 00:49:41.133
Ah. I will not be
ignored by the likes...

864
00:49:41.347 --> 00:49:46.056
- I'm going to jump.
- Phil, get back in there.

865
00:49:46.186 --> 00:49:48.095
- No.
- What are you doing up there?

866
00:49:48.229 --> 00:49:51.646
- Be reasonable.
- I can't take this fucking job...

867
00:49:51.775 --> 00:49:55.025
or those greasy shithead
teenagers any more.

868
00:49:55.153 --> 00:49:56.927
I'm going to end it all.

869
00:49:56.928 --> 00:50:00.065
Wait. Hold on. We're
getting help for you.

870
00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.199
Now we know Bobby's not
the killer. So who is?

871
00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.200
I don't know.

872
00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:05.970
Well, if the killer was
in your house last

873
00:50:05.971 --> 00:50:07.533
night, why didn't he
just kill you then?

874
00:50:07.666 --> 00:50:09.374
Because he's just messing with us.

875
00:50:09.502 --> 00:50:12.040
Don't you see? He's got us
right where he wants us.

876
00:50:12.171 --> 00:50:14.874
We can't go to the
police. He's just out

877
00:50:14.875 --> 00:50:17.379
there watching us
and waiting for us.

878
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:20.630
What are you waiting for, huh?

879
00:50:20.763 --> 00:50:23.634
What are you waiting for?

880
00:50:23.766 --> 00:50:26.471
What are you waiting for?

881
00:50:26.603 --> 00:50:28.303
- What am I waiting for?
- What are you waiting for?

882
00:50:28.396 --> 00:50:31.600
- What am I waiting for?
- What are you waiting for?

883
00:50:31.733 --> 00:50:34.770
Fuck you.

884
00:50:35.821 --> 00:50:37.897
Oh, my God.

885
00:50:38.031 --> 00:50:40.902
Ray, I still don't think
this party is a good idea.

886
00:50:41.034 --> 00:50:43.325
You know I'm not going to
let nothing happen to you.

887
00:50:43.326 --> 00:50:44.450
I just don't feel right.

888
00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:46.787
Why can't we just
do something else?

889
00:50:46.788 --> 00:50:48.993
Okay. How about we
go to the movies?

890
00:50:49.126 --> 00:50:51.404
Huh? You like that? See
a little movie, huh?

891
00:50:51.405 --> 00:50:52.405
Yes. Yeah.

892
00:50:55.174 --> 00:50:59.172
- Hey. That is my song.
- Hey.

893
00:50:59.303 --> 00:51:01.070
You know they gave me a
shout-out on the album, right?

894
00:51:01.071 --> 00:51:02.071
What?

895
00:51:02.072 --> 00:51:03.328
Yes.

896
00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:07.097
♪ Everywhere I go I
see the same ho's ♪

897
00:51:07.228 --> 00:51:09.020
Ooh, Brenda.

898
00:51:09.147 --> 00:51:11.270
Did I tell you how sexy
you look in my jersey?

899
00:51:11.399 --> 00:51:14.317
- I do, Ray?
- Yes.

900
00:51:14.444 --> 00:51:17.231
I like it. Hey, get up. Go-Go
over there. Let me see it.

901
00:51:21.827 --> 00:51:25.694
Ooh. Yes, I like that.

902
00:51:25.831 --> 00:51:27.637
You like that? You like
that? You like that?

903
00:51:27.638 --> 00:51:28.638
Yeah. Hey.

904
00:51:28.639 --> 00:51:31.495
Hey, put this on with it.

905
00:51:31.629 --> 00:51:33.107
Ray, you are so freaky.

906
00:51:33.108 --> 00:51:35.709
That's right. You know
I'm freaky, girl.

907
00:51:35.841 --> 00:51:37.799
Go on. Pull it. Pull it up.

908
00:51:41.139 --> 00:51:45.183
Yeah. Here, here. Put
this on with it.

909
00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:47.801
Go on.

910
00:51:47.937 --> 00:51:52.149
- Are you sure?
- Go on, girl. Go on. Pull it on.

911
00:51:52.275 --> 00:51:55.561
- Okay.
- Go on.

912
00:51:57.405 --> 00:52:00.406
- I like that look.
- Ooh. I'm bad.

913
00:52:00.534 --> 00:52:04.697
Ah, yes. Here. Put
this on with it.

914
00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:07.202
Go on, girl. Put it on.

915
00:52:07.332 --> 00:52:10.203
Yeah. Put that shit on there.
Come on. Just shove it on.

916
00:52:10.336 --> 00:52:14.203
Do it. Yeah. Ooh, so fucking sexy.

917
00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:16.878
Come here, girl. Bring your little
sexy ass over here. Come on.

918
00:52:17.009 --> 00:52:18.634
Full speed. Charge.

919
00:52:22.557 --> 00:52:24.715
Yes. Yes. Come on. Turn around.

920
00:52:24.851 --> 00:52:27.306
Turn around. Come
on. Yes, Brendan.

921
00:52:27.437 --> 00:52:29.341
Take it, Brendan.
Take it, Brendan.

922
00:52:29.342 --> 00:52:30.342
Who?

923
00:52:30.343 --> 00:52:32.644
Brenda. Come on, come
on. Put the helmet on.

924
00:52:32.776 --> 00:52:34.899
No, let's role-play.
Come on. You get me.

925
00:52:35.028 --> 00:52:37.270
- Get me. Come on. Come on.
- Huh?

926
00:52:37.405 --> 00:52:39.315
I'm here at Lover's Lookout.

927
00:52:39.449 --> 00:52:41.774
It's dark, it's in the
middle of nowhere...

928
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:43.567
and it's where
hormone-driven teens

929
00:52:43.568 --> 00:52:44.947
love to come and fool around.

930
00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:48.200
So very likely we're about
to see someone get killed.

931
00:52:48.333 --> 00:52:50.095
Okay, sure enough,
there's a girl in

932
00:52:50.096 --> 00:52:51.999
that car, blouse
unbuttoned, all alone.

933
00:52:52.129 --> 00:52:54.916
Let's see if she'll
have a word with us.

934
00:52:55.049 --> 00:52:58.632
Hi. Gail Hailstorm, author
of the new book You're Next.

935
00:52:58.761 --> 00:53:02.011
- Oh, yeah.
- Can you tell us your name?

936
00:53:02.139 --> 00:53:03.316
Well, my name's Heather.

937
00:53:03.317 --> 00:53:06.303
Heather, can you tell us what
you're doing out here all alone?

938
00:53:06.436 --> 00:53:10.018
Well, yeah, sure. My boyfriend and
I were just, like, making out...

939
00:53:10.148 --> 00:53:11.971
and then we heard a
noise out there,

940
00:53:11.972 --> 00:53:13.647
so he went to go check it, but...

941
00:53:13.776 --> 00:53:15.445
Well, that was, like,
ten minutes ago or so.

942
00:53:15.446 --> 00:53:16.446
Yeah, yeah.

943
00:53:16.447 --> 00:53:17.953
Heather, has it crossed
your little mind

944
00:53:17.954 --> 00:53:19.654
that your boyfriend was
probably murdered...

945
00:53:19.783 --> 00:53:23.152
and you're about to
be slaughtered next?

946
00:53:23.286 --> 00:53:25.860
Really? No way.

947
00:53:25.998 --> 00:53:27.096
Way. Heather, good luck.

948
00:53:27.097 --> 00:53:28.785
Okay, thanks, Gail.
You're the best.

949
00:53:28.917 --> 00:53:33.330
I know. Just as I thought. The
murder is happening as we speak.

950
00:53:33.464 --> 00:53:34.857
I'm going to try
and break into the

951
00:53:34.858 --> 00:53:36.133
bloodshed. Are you getting this?

952
00:53:36.258 --> 00:53:37.989
Excuse me. Heather,
Heather, can you

953
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:39.674
tell us what you're
feeling, honey?

954
00:53:39.804 --> 00:53:43.636
Lots of pain. Gail, please
help me. Gail, please.

955
00:53:43.766 --> 00:53:45.898
I'd like to help you out,
kid, but it's sweeps.

956
00:53:45.899 --> 00:53:47.764
Sir, sir, can I get a
word with you? Sir.

957
00:53:47.895 --> 00:53:49.487
You got a lot of
nerve coming here.

958
00:53:49.488 --> 00:53:50.813
I'm just trying to do my job.

959
00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:52.537
Get the camera off me now.
You're dead, bitch.

960
00:53:52.538 --> 00:53:53.874
No, Kenny, keep rolling.
Keep rolling.

961
00:53:53.938 --> 00:53:55.815
I'm going to slice your head
off and shove it up his ass.

962
00:53:55.816 --> 00:53:56.816
Sweet Jesus. Shit.

963
00:53:56.817 --> 00:53:58.062
Get, get that camera off me.

964
00:53:58.198 --> 00:54:02.575
Oh, my God, Kenny. Kenny,
move your fat ass.

965
00:54:02.702 --> 00:54:05.454
Kenny. Oh, my God,
he's right behind you.

966
00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:08.071
This man is chasing me, Gail.

967
00:54:14.423 --> 00:54:16.546
I am so scared right now.

968
00:54:18.344 --> 00:54:21.013
I just want to say...

969
00:54:21.138 --> 00:54:24.258
to the family of my
cameraman, Kenny...

970
00:54:24.392 --> 00:54:26.717
I am so sorry.

971
00:54:26.852 --> 00:54:30.304
This was my interview...

972
00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:32.895
my story.

973
00:54:33.026 --> 00:54:35.232
It's all my fault.

974
00:54:40.658 --> 00:54:42.263
You want some popcorn?

975
00:54:42.264 --> 00:54:45.071
I brought me a little
snack of my own.

976
00:54:47.916 --> 00:54:50.241
- You want some chicken?
- Nah.

977
00:54:53.839 --> 00:54:56.302
For all you all
talkers up in here,

978
00:54:56.303 --> 00:54:58.834
it's time to keep
it down right now.

979
00:55:00.804 --> 00:55:03.093
Back at you.

980
00:55:05.935 --> 00:55:08.971
Why they acting already? It
ain't nothing but the previews.

981
00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:15.687
The largest ship the
world had ever known.

982
00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:18.042
Its 400 passengers and crew on a

983
00:55:18.043 --> 00:55:20.612
maiden voyage to a
brave new world.

984
00:55:20.742 --> 00:55:23.659
A journey that would change
their lives forever.

985
00:55:28.625 --> 00:55:31.377
I'm the king of the world.

986
00:55:36.633 --> 00:55:39.469
Amistad II - Get your ass
back down there, boy.

987
00:55:39.595 --> 00:55:41.146
I'm going to go to the
bathroom real quick.

988
00:55:41.147 --> 00:55:42.798
Don't leave now. The
movie's about to come on.

989
00:55:42.932 --> 00:55:45.257
I got to go to the bathroom.
Here. Take your hot sauce.

990
00:55:45.392 --> 00:55:48.726
Hurry up, man. Don't be long.

991
00:55:48.854 --> 00:55:52.188
Back up. Let him through.

992
00:55:52.316 --> 00:55:55.104
You can move back some. You
don't own the theatre.

993
00:56:02.368 --> 00:56:04.190
And they're off.
It's number three in

994
00:56:04.191 --> 00:56:05.868
the lead. Number two close behind.

995
00:56:05.997 --> 00:56:08.204
And number three is the winner.

996
00:56:12.087 --> 00:56:15.538
Number two has placed,
and number four to show.

997
00:56:15.674 --> 00:56:19.838
Next week's Triple Crown
starts at 2:30. Be here early.

998
00:56:48.041 --> 00:56:50.497
Hey, who is that?

999
00:56:50.627 --> 00:56:52.584
Go ahead. Do it
again. Do it again.

1000
00:57:04.641 --> 00:57:07.097
Anon.

1001
00:57:12.525 --> 00:57:13.805
Don't go in there.

1002
00:57:20.616 --> 00:57:22.574
Lord, I'm going to
have a heart attack.

1003
00:57:22.702 --> 00:57:25.240
Damn, this is some scary shit.

1004
00:57:25.371 --> 00:57:27.779
Oh, I am scared.

1005
00:57:27.916 --> 00:57:30.585
Excuse me.

1006
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:33.415
I think I paid my money like
everybody else up in here.

1007
00:57:33.547 --> 00:57:36.631
- Out of her favour where I am...
- That ain't no man.

1008
00:57:36.758 --> 00:57:38.713
You can see her real
hair right there.

1009
00:57:38.714 --> 00:57:39.714
Do you mind?

1010
00:57:39.715 --> 00:57:42.803
I know you better
get out of my face.

1011
00:57:42.931 --> 00:57:45.719
Out of my face. Out of my face.

1012
00:57:45.851 --> 00:57:48.342
This is all me up in
here. You handle that.

1013
00:57:48.479 --> 00:57:50.934
- Will you shut the fuck up.
- Yeah.

1014
00:57:52.608 --> 00:57:56.357
This movie is good. Hey, baby.

1015
00:57:56.487 --> 00:57:58.895
You came back just in time.

1016
00:57:59.031 --> 00:58:01.605
She's about to get it
on with Shakespeare.

1017
00:58:01.742 --> 00:58:04.412
- He found out she's a girl.
- Shut up.

1018
00:58:04.537 --> 00:58:08.286
Yeah, I got you. I
got you on camera.

1019
00:58:08.416 --> 00:58:11.417
You on Candid Camera now.

1020
00:58:11.544 --> 00:58:13.204
You ain't know that.

1021
00:58:16.258 --> 00:58:20.255
Hello. Hey, girl. I'm
in the movie. Huh.

1022
00:58:20.387 --> 00:58:25.298
Shakespeare In Love.
. Ooh. You lying.

1023
00:58:25.434 --> 00:58:28.304
For Christ's sake, will
you just shut your trap.

1024
00:58:28.437 --> 00:58:30.726
- Shut up.
- Hold on.

1025
00:58:30.856 --> 00:58:33.774
I don't know why you all
is acting like this.

1026
00:58:33.901 --> 00:58:35.530
My girlfriend already
seen the movie. She said

1027
00:58:35.531 --> 00:58:36.985
they don't even stay
together in the end.

1028
00:58:37.113 --> 00:58:39.568
Give me that.

1029
00:58:39.699 --> 00:58:41.608
Right on.

1030
00:58:42.743 --> 00:58:45.744
Will you sit down?

1031
00:58:45.872 --> 00:58:47.864
Shut up.

1032
00:58:47.999 --> 00:58:50.324
Your ass is grass.

1033
00:58:53.838 --> 00:58:56.329
- This is for Thelma.
- And Louise.

1034
00:58:56.466 --> 00:58:58.957
This is for talking
through The Fugitive.

1035
00:58:59.094 --> 00:59:01.964
- You ruined Schindler's List.
- All Jackie Chan movies.

1036
00:59:02.097 --> 00:59:06.344
- Boogie Nights.
- And Big Momma's House.

1037
00:59:22.952 --> 00:59:26.202
And I cannot marry the daughter
of Sir Robert De Lesseps.

1038
00:59:29.584 --> 00:59:33.167
You guys, there's a, there's
a few too many people.

1039
00:59:33.296 --> 00:59:36.463
Oh, hi. Please don't, don't...
No. Hey, you guys, stop.

1040
00:59:36.591 --> 00:59:39.082
Hey. Hey, please. That's my dad's.

1041
00:59:39.219 --> 00:59:41.675
- No, don't touch... Ah, ah, no.
- Do you have more beer?

1042
00:59:41.805 --> 00:59:44.640
- Do you have more beer?
- No. Yeah. Check in the garage.

1043
00:59:44.766 --> 00:59:47.092
No, no, no, no, no. Don't.

1044
01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.908
Kitty, you scared me.

1045
01:00:16.132 --> 01:00:19.584
Horsey. Oh, you scared me too.

1046
01:00:24.224 --> 01:00:27.178
Hello? Who's there?

1047
01:00:30.022 --> 01:00:32.773
Oh, my God. Oh, my
God. Please, don't.

1048
01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:35.473
Please. I'm just a day player.

1049
01:00:51.461 --> 01:00:53.085
Oh, my God.

1052
01:01:28.708 --> 01:01:32.955
Yeah. Yeah.

1053
01:01:33.087 --> 01:01:37.037
Oh, Bobby. Bobby. I was
worried about you.

1054
01:01:37.175 --> 01:01:40.793
I thought the killer got
to you before I could.

1055
01:01:40.929 --> 01:01:42.637
Could what?

1056
01:01:42.764 --> 01:01:45.516
I wanna go upstairs. There's
something I wanna show you.

1057
01:01:47.894 --> 01:01:50.220
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

1058
01:01:50.355 --> 01:01:53.226
- Hey, party on.
- Yeah.

1059
01:01:58.781 --> 01:02:01.698
- So...
- So.

1060
01:02:01.825 --> 01:02:04.495
Here we are again.

1061
01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.613
Yeah.

1062
01:02:08.124 --> 01:02:10.531
And, you know, if
you're not ready...

1063
01:02:12.211 --> 01:02:14.916
I'll understand.

1064
01:02:15.047 --> 01:02:16.590
Bobby.

1065
01:02:16.716 --> 01:02:18.709
I am ready.

1066
01:02:20.094 --> 01:02:22.004
- You are?
- Yeah.

1067
01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:28.599
I can't keep fighting these urges.

1068
01:02:28.728 --> 01:02:31.564
I have to just give in to them...

1069
01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:33.729
and let them flow.

1070
01:02:33.859 --> 01:02:35.898
Right.

1071
01:02:36.028 --> 01:02:37.522
Bobby?

1072
01:02:37.654 --> 01:02:40.655
I have been so selfish.

1073
01:02:43.035 --> 01:02:45.111
This is like a scene from
a movie or something.

1074
01:02:45.246 --> 01:02:47.819
Only it isn't a movie, Bobby.

1075
01:02:47.957 --> 01:02:49.831
This is real life.

1076
01:02:51.127 --> 01:02:53.452
It's all a movie, baby.

1077
01:02:53.588 --> 01:02:55.485
There's the sound guy. There's the

1078
01:02:55.486 --> 01:02:57.716
script supervisor.
How ya doing, baby?

1079
01:02:57.842 --> 01:03:00.167
- Bobby?
- What?

1080
01:03:00.303 --> 01:03:05.463
What I mean is that
in real life...

1081
01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.008

1083
01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:45.302

1084
01:03:45.433 --> 01:03:48.434
Sure, man.

1085
01:03:48.561 --> 01:03:52.096

Yo, son, you got to roll
some more of that shit.

1088
01:03:58.071 --> 01:03:59.154
Ah, shit.

1089
01:03:59.155 --> 01:04:02.401

more papers, man.

Bobby. I've never
done this before.

1099
01:05:01.783 --> 01:05:02.783

01:11:03.931 --> 01:11:07.596
Why? Why? You hear that, Ray?

1188
01:11:07.726 --> 01:11:10.217
I think she wants a motive.

1189
01:11:10.354 --> 01:11:13.189
- Did Scream have a plot?
- No.

1190
01:11:13.315 --> 01:11:15.771
Did I Know what You Did
Last Summer make any sense?

1191
01:11:15.901 --> 01:11:18.130
Don't think so. And what
about the sequel? Huh? What

1192
01:11:18.131 --> 01:11:20.149
the hell was with that
fat, white Jamaican kid?

1193
01:11:20.281 --> 01:11:22.187
Oh, I wanna kill
that motherfucker.

1194
01:11:22.188 --> 01:11:24.694
I know. Me too, man. It
was bad casting, Bobby.

1195
01:11:24.827 --> 01:11:27.318
How about this for a
motive? Lack of sex.

1196
01:11:27.455 --> 01:11:30.575
It can cause serious
deviant behaviour.

1197
01:11:30.708 --> 01:11:34.243
- I thought you loved me.
- Oh, I did, baby.

1198
01:11:34.379 --> 01:11:36.253
I did. But abstinence can make you

1199
01:11:36.254 --> 01:11:38.293
discover new things
about yourself.

1200
01:11:38.425 --> 01:11:41.342
That's right, Cindy. I'm gay.

1201
01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:43.758
And in case you haven't
noticed, so is Ray.

1202
01:11:45.432 --> 01:11:47.674
What? I ain't gay.

1203
01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:50.673
What are you talking about?
You took me to that club.

1204
01:11:50.674 --> 01:11:52.104
So? They play good music.

1205
01:11:52.231 --> 01:11:54.249
What about our trip to
San Francisco, then?

1206
01:11:54.250 --> 01:11:55.434
I wanted to go shopping.

1207
01:11:57.194 --> 01:11:58.650
But you made love to me.

1208
01:11:58.651 --> 01:12:00.777
No. First of all, you sucked my...

1209
01:12:00.907 --> 01:12:02.325
Whatever, Ray. I
don't want to talk

1210
01:12:02.326 --> 01:12:03.861
about this now. The
point is, Cindy...

1211
01:12:03.993 --> 01:12:06.071
that I'm a new man, and
I'm ready to leave

1212
01:12:06.072 --> 01:12:07.908
all this behind and
start a new life.

1213
01:12:08.039 --> 01:12:11.574
- So you killed all your friends?
- Oh, no.

1214
01:12:11.709 --> 01:12:13.868
Just you. And maybe Shorty...

1215
01:12:14.003 --> 01:12:15.961
but that wasn't
planned or anything.

1216
01:12:16.089 --> 01:12:18.414
But here's the genius part.

1217
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:21.884
We're copycatting a serial
killer that already exists.

1218
01:12:22.012 --> 01:12:25.796
- It's the perfect crime, Cindy.
- But wait. There's more.

1219
01:12:25.933 --> 01:12:31.175
Hang on to your seat, baby,
because this one's a screamer.

1220
01:12:31.313 --> 01:12:34.563
- I'll be back.
- Oh.

1221
01:12:34.692 --> 01:12:37.064
Move your big ass. Come on.

1222
01:12:37.194 --> 01:12:39.483
Dad.

1223
01:12:39.613 --> 01:12:42.235
What are you going
to do, frame him?

1224
01:12:42.366 --> 01:12:46.578
Nah. We're just having a little
bit of fun with old daddio.

1225
01:12:46.704 --> 01:12:49.326
The police are going to find
you and daddy both dead...

1226
01:12:49.457 --> 01:12:52.873
and me and Ray are the only
survivors of a maniac's revenge.

1227
01:12:52.902 --> 01:12:54.937
- You ready? I'm ready.
- You ready? I'm ready to do this.

1228
01:12:54.938 --> 01:12:55.938
All right. Let's do this, Ray.

1229
01:12:55.963 --> 01:12:57.363
Let's do this. I'm
ready to do this shit.

1230
01:12:57.364 --> 01:12:59.247
- Come on. Come on. All right.
- All right. All right.

1231
01:12:59.384 --> 01:13:00.384
Come on. Come on.

1232
01:13:00.385 --> 01:13:01.709
Give it to me. Give it to me. No.

1233
01:13:01.845 --> 01:13:04.846
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- All right.

1234
01:13:04.973 --> 01:13:06.461
Ready? You ready? All
right. Let's do this.

1235
01:13:06.462 --> 01:13:07.462
Wait, wait. Ready.

1236
01:13:07.463 --> 01:13:08.726
- Come on. Come on.
- Ready.

1237
01:13:08.852 --> 01:13:10.394
Come on. Give it to
me. Give it to me.

1238
01:13:10.421 --> 01:13:11.922
No. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. Just...

1239
01:13:11.923 --> 01:13:13.172
You remember what we talked about?

1240
01:13:13.199 --> 01:13:14.946
I know, man. How many times
we going to go over this?

1241
01:13:14.947 --> 01:13:15.947
To the side, right?

1242
01:13:15.948 --> 01:13:17.256
I know, okay? Stop.
Just... All right.

1243
01:13:17.257 --> 01:13:18.257
Okay. All right. I'm ready.

1244
01:13:18.305 --> 01:13:21.112
Trust me, okay? I got this
shit. Ready? Come on.

1245
01:13:21.206 --> 01:13:22.544
Wait, wait, wait. I
just don't know...

1246
01:13:22.545 --> 01:13:24.240
What the fuck. I'm about
to cut your throat, boy.

1247
01:13:24.241 --> 01:13:25.241
Okay.

1248
01:13:25.273 --> 01:13:26.873
Stop acting like a little
girl. Come on. Come on.

1249
01:13:26.895 --> 01:13:29.120
You're right, you're right, you're
right, you're right. I'm ready.

1250
01:13:29.121 --> 01:13:30.121
Come on. You ready?

1251
01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:35.211
You guys are psychos. You've
seen one too many TV shows.

1252
01:13:35.338 --> 01:13:40.000
No. Watching television shows
doesn't create psycho killers.

1253
01:13:40.135 --> 01:13:42.044
Cancelling TV shows does.

1254
01:13:42.178 --> 01:13:44.420
The Wayans Brothers
was a good show, man.

1255
01:13:44.556 --> 01:13:49.099
It was a good-ass show, and we
didn't even get a final episode.

1256
01:13:49.227 --> 01:13:52.762
Take it easy. I'm feeling
a little woozy here.

1257
01:13:52.898 --> 01:13:55.270
It's my turn. Give me the knife.

1258
01:13:55.401 --> 01:13:58.318
Fuck out of here. Ain't
nobody stabbing me.

1259
01:14:06.996 --> 01:14:09.534
Surprise, Cindy.

1260
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:05.471
All right, all right.
Hold on a second.

1261
01:15:05.599 --> 01:15:08.137
Just give me a moment. Ah. One...

1262
01:15:13.815 --> 01:15:16.022
Oh, yeah. That's it.

1263
01:15:16.151 --> 01:15:19.105
Ah. Okay.

1264
01:15:54.066 --> 01:15:57.232
Dad. Are you okay?

1265
01:15:57.361 --> 01:16:00.231
I thought I told you not to
have a party unless I was here.

1266
01:16:00.364 --> 01:16:02.819
But, Dad, you were here.
You were in the closet.

1267
01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:04.725
Oh, yeah, that's
right. Did you get

1268
01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:06.401
some girlfriends' numbers for me?

1269
01:16:06.537 --> 01:16:07.584
Dad, they're dead.

1270
01:16:07.585 --> 01:16:09.573
Ah, you know, I can't get a break.

1271
01:16:09.707 --> 01:16:12.079
What's that? Is that the cops?

1272
01:16:12.209 --> 01:16:14.747
Okay, okay, listen,
honey. Help me up now.

1273
01:16:14.879 --> 01:16:17.963
If the cops come, tell
them I'm a plumber, okay?

1274
01:16:18.091 --> 01:16:20.045
You had a leaky faucet,
and you called, and they

1275
01:16:20.046 --> 01:16:21.839
sent me over. We don't
even know each other.

1276
01:16:27.684 --> 01:16:31.135
No. No.

1277
01:16:31.271 --> 01:16:33.264
Dad, Dad, put your arms down.

1278
01:16:35.734 --> 01:16:36.771
What the hell's going on here?

1279
01:16:36.772 --> 01:16:38.035
Sheriff, it's a
bloodbath in there.

1280
01:16:38.153 --> 01:16:40.478
- He was right here. I swear it.
- Who was?

1281
01:16:40.614 --> 01:16:44.398
The killer. The guy that
murdered all my friends.

1282
01:16:44.535 --> 01:16:48.034
And the sick bastard planted
drugs all in the house there.

1283
01:16:48.163 --> 01:16:51.118
- All over the place.
- Dad. Stop it.

1284
01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:52.704
All right, Cindy.
I'm going to have

1285
01:16:52.705 --> 01:16:54.037
to take you down to the station.

1286
01:16:54.170 --> 01:16:55.997
I'm cool, though, right?

1287
01:16:56.130 --> 01:16:58.087
- I'm okay?
- Let's... Let's go, Cindy.

1288
01:16:58.216 --> 01:17:02.427
Cindy. Call me. Call me.

1289
01:17:02.553 --> 01:17:04.012
Daddy'll get you out, honey.

1290
01:17:06.307 --> 01:17:10.471
Okay. Let's go over this again.

1291
01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:24.942
- You say it was an accident.
- Yes.

1292
01:17:25.055 --> 01:17:26.055
He was on the road.

1293
01:17:26.056 --> 01:17:28.197
And you think he came
back to get revenge?

1294
01:17:28.330 --> 01:17:31.165
It has to be him, Sheriff.

1295
01:17:36.881 --> 01:17:38.838
Here, Sheriff. They wanted
me to give this to you.

1296
01:17:38.966 --> 01:17:41.718
- That'll be all, Doofy.
- Okay.

1297
01:17:41.844 --> 01:17:42.996
I'm going to go, then.

1298
01:17:42.998 --> 01:17:44.515
- All right.
- All right.

1299
01:17:45.932 --> 01:17:47.592
Bye, Cind.

1300
01:17:50.812 --> 01:17:53.184
I'm sorry, Cindy. It wasn't
the man you guys killed.

1301
01:17:53.315 --> 01:17:55.177
His name was David
Keegan. Some fishermen

1302
01:17:55.178 --> 01:17:56.684
found his body a few weeks later.

1303
01:17:56.818 --> 01:17:58.998
He's buried in Lakewood Cemetery.

1304
01:17:58.999 --> 01:18:00.270
That's impossible.

1305
01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.827
Then I don't know who it could be.

1306
01:18:03.828 --> 01:18:05.028
He's got to be someone...

1307
01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.547
who was connected
with all the victims,

1308
01:18:06.548 --> 01:18:07.830
someone who knew
about the accident.

1309
01:18:07.955 --> 01:18:11.240
Someone who could move around
without being noticed.

1310
01:18:13.586 --> 01:18:16.706
Oh, my God.

1311
01:18:16.839 --> 01:18:19.480
She used to baby-sit
my brother Doofy.

1312
01:18:19.481 --> 01:18:21.715
He had the biggest crush on her.

1313
01:18:21.844 --> 01:18:23.884
It's me, Cind.

1314
01:18:24.013 --> 01:18:25.294
'Night, Cind.

1315
01:18:29.227 --> 01:18:31.303
- Doofy.
- Shithead?

1316
01:18:34.441 --> 01:18:35.639
- Have you seen Doofy?
- No.

1317
01:18:35.775 --> 01:18:37.270
- Have you seen Doofy?
- No, Sheriff.

1318
01:18:37.402 --> 01:18:39.442
- Has anybody seen Doofy?
- No.

1319
01:18:39.571 --> 01:18:41.822
Yeah. Just went out
the back, Sheriff.

1320
01:18:41.823 --> 01:18:42.823
