1
00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:17.612
Hey, there. Sorry to
bother you, folks,

2
00:01:17.745 --> 00:01:20.147
but, uh, we're looking
for an individual.

3
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.016
Golden-brown complexion.

4
00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.383
15 pounds.

5
00:01:23.518 --> 00:01:24.619
No head.

6
00:01:24.752 --> 00:01:26.353
I know where he is.

7
00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:28.690
I'll even serve him up on
a silver platter for you.

8
00:01:28.823 --> 00:01:30.525
Now get in here.

9
00:01:30.658 --> 00:01:32.359
I'm glad to see you finally
out of your man cave.

10
00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:34.227
Well, you know, Amanda
can be pretty convincing

11
00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:36.163
when she wants to be.
Hey, babe. Eric's here.

12
00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:37.865
Hey, Amanda.

13
00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.601
Well, well, well, well.

14
00:01:39.734 --> 00:01:41.836
You made it. Yeah.

15
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.270
Sorry.

16
00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:45.339
Thomas. One second.

17
00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:47.508
I baked this for you. I
couldn't eat it by myself.

18
00:01:47.642 --> 00:01:49.043
It would just be too depressing.

19
00:01:49.176 --> 00:01:50.344
Wow.

20
00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:51.713
You baked this?

21
00:01:51.846 --> 00:01:53.081
Yeah, you know,
for a single guy,

22
00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:54.849
I know my way around the oven.

23
00:01:55.083 --> 00:01:57.752
Ah... A guy in uniform
who knows how to bake.

24
00:01:57.885 --> 00:02:00.021
I have a feeling you're not
gonna be single for long.

25
00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:01.623
Come on. You remember
my mom, right?

26
00:02:01.756 --> 00:02:03.290
- Hey, Mom, remember Eric?
- Oh, hey.

27
00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:04.892
Happy Thanksgiving.

28
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.461
Uh, do you want
any or...? No, no.

29
00:02:07.595 --> 00:02:09.030
Jeans and a sweater?

30
00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:11.365
You could at least
make an effort.

31
00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:13.901
Casual's more my
thing, Kathleen.

32
00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:15.570
Especially in my own house.

33
00:02:15.703 --> 00:02:18.873
Don't you mean "our house" now?

34
00:02:19.107 --> 00:02:20.173
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Hi, Dad.

35
00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:21.542
Happy Thanksgiving.

36
00:02:21.676 --> 00:02:23.210
Oh, thank God
you're back, Thomas.

37
00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:25.513
Thought we'd be eating
a frozen turkey dinner.

38
00:02:25.647 --> 00:02:27.682
This guy.

39
00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:31.085
Sorry, Rob. Yeah,
this is the first time

40
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:32.720
the store's open
on Thanksgiving.

41
00:02:32.854 --> 00:02:35.389
You know, we always do the,
uh, midnight Black Friday,

42
00:02:35.523 --> 00:02:37.424
but people were showing up
at 6:00 p.m. anyway, so...

43
00:02:37.558 --> 00:02:39.159
And you're a smart man, Thomas.

44
00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:40.561
Yeah, well, credit my
beautiful fiancée over there.

45
00:02:40.695 --> 00:02:41.896
It was her idea.

46
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.330
Well, from what
I've been hearing

47
00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:44.732
about the turnout,
it is going to be

48
00:02:44.866 --> 00:02:47.735
a very happy Thanksgiving.

49
00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:49.469
Here we go.

50
00:02:49.604 --> 00:02:51.673
Oh, that's beautiful. Yes.

51
00:02:51.806 --> 00:02:54.441
Mitch, we need your
carving skills.

52
00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:56.410
I've got time to carve
it but not to eat it.

53
00:02:56.544 --> 00:02:58.780
Oh, what? Thomas is
not making you work.

54
00:02:58.913 --> 00:03:01.115
Blame Bob.
Apparently, he's AWOL.

55
00:03:01.248 --> 00:03:03.584
Thomas called and said it's
me working or I'm fired.

56
00:03:03.718 --> 00:03:05.385
Oh, sorry, buddy.

57
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.354
Aw! The store
shouldn't even be open.

58
00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:09.090
It's Thanksgiving.

59
00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:10.658
I know, Mary, but
let's face it.

60
00:03:10.792 --> 00:03:12.593
Black Friday starts
on a Thursday now.

61
00:03:12.727 --> 00:03:14.662
Even in Plymouth.

62
00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:19.199
Hey, Bon Jovi, why don't
you get to the back

63
00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:20.601
of the fucking line,
okay? Yeah, suck my dick!

64
00:03:20.735 --> 00:03:21.669
We were here first.

65
00:03:21.803 --> 00:03:23.336
Hey, everybody.

66
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.173
Just fucking calm down.

67
00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:27.175
Two hits. I hit you,
you hit the ground, kid!

68
00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:28.776
What the fuck?!

69
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.145
- Jesus, everybody, be patient!
- Hey, fuck you!

70
00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:32.747
Let us in, or you'll be a
patient in Mass General.

71
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.347
What the fuck is
wrong with you people?

72
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:35.415
Fucking funny, eh?

73
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.784
The store opens in ten minutes.

74
00:03:36.918 --> 00:03:38.786
You'll get your waffle iron!

75
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.755
Xanax? No, you
got a fire hose?

76
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.691
Todd,

77
00:03:43.825 --> 00:03:45.593
I need you at the register.

78
00:03:49.664 --> 00:03:51.632
Thank you.

79
00:03:55.636 --> 00:03:57.872
Bunch of goddamn morons.

80
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:08.583
When Kathleen sold
my dad this house,

81
00:04:08.716 --> 00:04:10.718
I didn't realize she
was coming with it.

82
00:04:10.852 --> 00:04:13.821
She'll never be able to
replace your mom, Jess.

83
00:04:15.957 --> 00:04:17.558
Yeah.

84
00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:21.328
And look at it this way.

85
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:23.030
It was a quick engagement,

86
00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:26.299
so hopefully it'll
be a quick divorce.

87
00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:28.002
Please, God.

88
00:04:36.778 --> 00:04:38.478
Oh. Let's go.

89
00:04:38.613 --> 00:04:41.215
Dad, we're going to the
movies. Have fun. Uh, Bobby,

90
00:04:41.348 --> 00:04:42.717
I want to hear about
that 19-strikeout game

91
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.018
against UCLA, when you get back.

92
00:04:44.252 --> 00:04:45.820
Deal, Thomas. Good
night, everyone.

93
00:04:45.953 --> 00:04:48.022
Scuba invited Yulia.
He's into her.

94
00:04:48.256 --> 00:04:49.624
Got it. I'll gas him up.

95
00:04:49.757 --> 00:04:51.259
Okay.

96
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.595
Bobby. Bobby Boucher.

97
00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.330
Bobby "Golden Arm"
home for Thanksgiving,

98
00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:58.766
and my ride or die,
J-Money. What up, dawg?

99
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.433
I heard you're the
new Friday Night guy.

100
00:05:00.568 --> 00:05:02.737
Ah, I'd better be, with a
96-mile-per-hour fastball.

101
00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:06.707
Evan, you are
such a dick. What?

102
00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:09.309
Yo, nice job beating Hanover.

103
00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:10.745
Scuba, I heard you
were unstoppable.

104
00:05:10.878 --> 00:05:12.213
Thanks, man. It was
a pretty good night

105
00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:13.446
until Tyson Fury over here

106
00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:14.882
almost got us
locked the fuck up.

107
00:05:15.016 --> 00:05:16.617
- Classic Evan.
- Why? What happened?

108
00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:18.418
We got in a run-in with
some drunk Hanover assholes.

109
00:05:18.553 --> 00:05:19.887
Fuck Hanover. I
popped one of them

110
00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:21.722
in the eye, but this
one was too busy

111
00:05:21.856 --> 00:05:23.490
filming herself to get
some fucking footage.

112
00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:25.293
Shit would've broke
the Internets.

113
00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:27.427
You are lucky I didn't
film that, okay?

114
00:05:27.562 --> 00:05:28.896
It was, like, Waffle
House-level cringe.

115
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.832
It was bad.

116
00:05:30.965 --> 00:05:32.633
♪ Crunk ain't dead, crunk ain't
dead, crunk ain't dead... ♪

117
00:05:32.767 --> 00:05:34.068
Fuck Hanover!

118
00:05:34.302 --> 00:05:37.337
Fuck Hanover! Fuck Hanover!

119
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.873
Fuck Hanover!

120
00:05:45.012 --> 00:05:46.681
This fucking traffic
is ridiculous.

121
00:05:46.814 --> 00:05:48.516
Oh, I can't handle this shit.

122
00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:50.585
Yo.

123
00:05:50.718 --> 00:05:51.919
Pit stop. I need a new phone.

124
00:05:52.053 --> 00:05:53.453
Mine got fucking
smashed in the fight.

125
00:05:53.588 --> 00:05:54.555
We're not going to
the store. It's a zoo.

126
00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:55.823
Whoa, no, no, no, yes, we are,

127
00:05:55.957 --> 00:05:57.390
'cause Evan owes
me a new lipstick.

128
00:05:57.525 --> 00:05:58.526
Thank you. Don't
worry, don't worry...

129
00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:59.861
- What?
- Guys, I thought

130
00:05:59.994 --> 00:06:00.928
we were going to the
movies. Yeah, we-we are.

131
00:06:01.062 --> 00:06:02.263
We are. How am I gonna text

132
00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:03.097
during the movie
without a phone?

133
00:06:03.331 --> 00:06:04.464

- Five minutes. In and out.

142

143
00:06:23.517 --> 00:06:24.852
You can't park your car here.

144
00:06:24.986 --> 00:06:26.386
It's not a car, it's an SUV.

145
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.955
Hey, babe, c-can I
just stay here, please?

146
00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:29.957
Please don't make me
do this alone. I...

147
00:06:30.091 --> 00:06:31.692
Bobby, can I get a selfie?

148
00:06:31.826 --> 00:06:33.327
Hey, one-one second.
I'll be right back.

149
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.896
Hey, man. What's up? Yo.

150
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:36.731
Bobby, Bobby, we have to move.

151
00:06:36.864 --> 00:06:38.299
Yeah, yeah, one
second, one second.

152
00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:40.167
Bobby "Golden Arm,"
all-time record holder

153
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.703
for strikeouts at
Plymouth East! Yes, sir.

154
00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.307
Hey, Jess. Hey.

155
00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:48.542
This is, like, the last place
I thought I'd see you tonight.

156
00:06:48.676 --> 00:06:49.911
Yeah, you and me both.

157
00:06:50.044 --> 00:06:52.013
Your dad's store is
insane right now.

158
00:06:52.146 --> 00:06:53.314
Look at all these people.

159
00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:54.982
Um, sorry, Ryan, I-I have to

160
00:06:55.116 --> 00:06:56.550
catch up with my friends.
Oh, I'll walk you.

161
00:06:56.684 --> 00:06:58.519
Come on. Come on.

162
00:06:58.653 --> 00:07:01.488
So, uh, what are you
doing Saturday night?

163
00:07:01.622 --> 00:07:02.890
Going to the Cap with Bobby.

164
00:07:03.024 --> 00:07:04.859
All right, well...
Uh, excuse me...

165
00:07:04.992 --> 00:07:06.694
I'm having a little
get-together with my friends...

166
00:07:06.827 --> 00:07:08.629
Excuse me... and, uh, you
know, if you wanted to come by,

167
00:07:08.763 --> 00:07:10.197
it's just gonna be
like a couple people...

168
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.333
I can't. Bobby's only in
town till Monday, so...

169
00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:13.701
You should just swing by early.

170
00:07:13.834 --> 00:07:15.202
We could, like, play
some drinking games,

171
00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.004
have a good time, you
know. I got some kegs.

172
00:07:17.138 --> 00:07:19.073
She's all set, Ryan.
Come on. Let's go.

173
00:07:20.775 --> 00:07:22.410
Excuse me.

174
00:07:24.578 --> 00:07:26.013
Chill out, he's just helping.

175
00:07:26.147 --> 00:07:28.349
Oh, what a gentleman.

176
00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:29.784
Face it.

177
00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:31.484
As long as Golden Arm's
around, you're toast.

178
00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:33.421
Scott. Scott. Burnt. Toast.

179
00:07:33.554 --> 00:07:36.190
Shut the fuck up, Scott.
Burnt soggy toast.

180
00:07:36.424 --> 00:07:37.925
I love you, dude, but I'm
gonna fucking kill you.

181
00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:39.527
Mm, try your best.

182
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.062
Want to open that gate
for us, gentlemen?

183
00:07:41.195 --> 00:07:42.495
Excuse me, excuse me.
Here, Amanda, get in here.

184
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.831
Oh, my God.

185
00:07:43.965 --> 00:07:44.932
Good evening. Good
evening, Sheriff.

186
00:07:45.066 --> 00:07:47.068
Jesus Christ.

187
00:07:47.201 --> 00:07:49.036
Fuck you.

188
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:50.738
This is insane.

189
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:53.574
Yeah. Let's go in
the back. Okay.

190
00:07:56.544 --> 00:07:58.012
Hey!

191
00:07:58.145 --> 00:08:01.082
Hey, you! We got some
unfinished business, you fuck!

192
00:08:01.215 --> 00:08:03.483
Oh, fuck, that's the guy
from Hanover I punched.

193
00:08:03.617 --> 00:08:04.585
Fuck you!

194
00:08:04.719 --> 00:08:05.653
Suck my cock!

195
00:08:05.786 --> 00:08:06.654
Pussy.

196
00:08:06.787 --> 00:08:07.722
Hey, fuck you!

197
00:08:07.855 --> 00:08:08.956
Fuck your mom, fucking pussies!

198
00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.791
Yo, Lonnie, where's your mom at?
-Hey!

199
00:08:10.925 --> 00:08:12.560
That's what I thought!
Fuck your cousin,

200
00:08:12.693 --> 00:08:14.028
your second cousin
and fuck your dog!

201
00:08:14.161 --> 00:08:16.063
Let's just get what you
need and get out of here.

202
00:08:16.197 --> 00:08:17.798
In and out, I promise.

203
00:08:17.932 --> 00:08:19.667
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

204
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.536
Why are you fucking letting
those fucking jerkoffs in there?

205
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.006
Hello? I fucking see you.

206
00:08:25.139 --> 00:08:27.008
It's Thanks-fucking-giving!

207
00:08:27.141 --> 00:08:29.076
It's an American holiday!

208
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.811
Come on, man.
It's a pizza oven.

209
00:08:30.945 --> 00:08:32.980
- Where do you think it goes?
- Sorry, Mitch.

210
00:08:33.114 --> 00:08:34.949
Ten minutes, people.
Please, come on.

211
00:08:35.082 --> 00:08:36.717
Hi. Surprise. Hey.

212
00:08:36.851 --> 00:08:38.052
Hey, babe. What
are you doing here?

213
00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:39.887
I came in with Eric.

214
00:08:40.021 --> 00:08:41.288
I didn't want you to starve
on Thanksgiving. Yeah.

215
00:08:41.522 --> 00:08:42.823
I got a call on the radio

216
00:08:42.957 --> 00:08:44.492
about needing some
crowd control. Uh, yeah.

217
00:08:44.625 --> 00:08:46.560
In fact, you should
probably wait in here, okay?

218
00:08:46.694 --> 00:08:47.695
Okay. Are you okay?

219
00:08:47.828 --> 00:08:48.796
Yeah. We should... Yeah?

220
00:08:48.929 --> 00:08:50.431
We should go. Be careful.

221
00:08:53.034 --> 00:08:54.568
Fucking guy Lonnie's
30 years old.

222
00:08:54.702 --> 00:08:55.736
Dude, he's just mad
He got held back

223
00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.506
I took his mom to
prom. Two years

224
00:08:57.638 --> 00:08:59.006
and she gave me a handy. And
he's dating a cheerleader.

225
00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.608
Hey, Jess, does your dad
still sell shock collars?

226
00:09:00.741 --> 00:09:02.576
Or a tranquilizer?
Or a sedative?

227
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:04.111
This is like in the fucking
apocalypse movies...

228
00:09:04.245 --> 00:09:05.546
Evan. ...where you could
take anything you want.

229
00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:06.814
Evan!

230
00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:08.482
- Scuba.
- Come on.

231
00:09:08.616 --> 00:09:09.984
You know what time
it is, boys. Guys.

232
00:09:10.117 --> 00:09:11.152
Let's go. Fletcher...

233
00:09:11.285 --> 00:09:12.820
Oh, my God, here we go.

234
00:09:12.953 --> 00:09:13.988
to Dybing! What happened
to stealth mission?

235
00:09:14.121 --> 00:09:15.456
Come on.

236
00:09:15.589 --> 00:09:17.691
The store will open
in ten minutes.

237
00:09:17.825 --> 00:09:20.661
Fucking Christ! Just
stay calm, take a breath.

238
00:09:20.795 --> 00:09:22.596
Everybody's gonna get
their Furbies, all right?

239
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:24.698
Oh, yeah? Why the fuck did
they get in there first?

240
00:09:24.832 --> 00:09:26.967
Who? This is fucking bullshit!

241
00:09:27.101 --> 00:09:29.504
They're getting dibs
on all the good shit.

242
00:09:29.637 --> 00:09:30.638
Oh, fuck me.

243
00:09:30.771 --> 00:09:32.039
Those are our fucking Furbies.

244
00:09:32.173 --> 00:09:33.074
Mitch, what the
hell are you doing?

245
00:09:33.207 --> 00:09:34.575
I didn't let them in.

246
00:09:34.708 --> 00:09:36.010
You think I let them
in? Come on, man.

247
00:09:36.143 --> 00:09:37.645
What are they doing
in there, man?

248
00:09:37.778 --> 00:09:39.780
You fucking better let
us in right fucking now.

249
00:09:39.914 --> 00:09:41.550
All right, everybody,
just stay calm please.

250
00:09:41.682 --> 00:09:43.651
Fuck you! Just push back
and stay calm, everybody.

251
00:09:43.784 --> 00:09:45.686
Doug, lock it up. Now. Yeah.

252
00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.622
Guys, nobody's getting in.

253
00:09:48.756 --> 00:09:50.191
We're locking the doors.

254
00:09:53.194 --> 00:09:55.029
Stay calm and back up!

255
00:09:55.162 --> 00:09:56.964
We need you to push
back a little bit.

256
00:09:57.098 --> 00:09:59.133
Hold this for me. Fuck
you, bitch. Hey, hey.

257
00:09:59.266 --> 00:10:01.869
Hey, store's open,
everyone. Hey, give me that.

258
00:10:02.002 --> 00:10:03.737
We need backup immediately!

259
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:07.341
Step right up, get your
fucking waffle irons!

260
00:10:11.846 --> 00:10:12.813
Hold up.

261
00:10:12.947 --> 00:10:14.081
Manny, I need help!

262
00:10:17.118 --> 00:10:18.752
Oh, my God.

263
00:10:18.886 --> 00:10:20.154
Dude. The fuck is happening?

264
00:10:20.287 --> 00:10:22.356
What the fuck is going on?

265
00:10:24.325 --> 00:10:26.827
Fuck this shit!

266
00:10:26.961 --> 00:10:29.697
Manny! Manny, help! Fuck!

267
00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.665
Where the fuck are you going?

268
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.004
Hey, back the fuck
up, back the fuck up.

269
00:10:37.138 --> 00:10:39.039
Open the door. They're
gonna get crushed. Open it.

270
00:10:39.173 --> 00:10:40.908
You have to open the door.
You have to get to Mitch.

271
00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:42.611
Get Mitch, Doug. You
have to get to him.

272
00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:43.944
- Okay, yeah, I'll open it.
- Oh, my God.

273
00:10:44.078 --> 00:10:45.646
Jess, Jess, call your dad.

274
00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:47.081
Jess, call your dad right
now. Give me your phone.

275
00:10:47.214 --> 00:10:48.816
Yo, open the door! Give
me your fucking phone.

276
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:50.251
They're gonna get crushed.
Open the fucking door.

277
00:10:50.384 --> 00:10:51.385
What are you doing?
Open the fucking door!

278
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.887
Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah.

279
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.054
Just gotta find the key.
Looking for the key.

280
00:10:54.188 --> 00:10:55.923
Open the door! Bobby?

281
00:10:56.056 --> 00:10:57.592
- Open the fucking door.
- Hold on, calm down.

282
00:10:57.725 --> 00:10:58.993
What is wrong with
you? Stop shoving.

283
00:10:59.126 --> 00:11:00.227
Get off of me! Shit!
Fuck off! Fuck off!

284
00:11:02.096 --> 00:11:04.198
Back the fuck up! What the...?

285
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.002
Oh, fuck, back the fuck
up! Back the fuck up!

286
00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.742
Go. Go. Oh, my God.

287
00:11:19.046 --> 00:11:20.881
Fucking move.

288
00:11:24.051 --> 00:11:26.453
Lonnie, grab it!

289
00:11:26.687 --> 00:11:28.623
Get off, that's my
fucking waffle iron!

290
00:11:31.025 --> 00:11:33.460
This is fucking gold.
This is fucking crazy.

291
00:11:33.694 --> 00:11:35.062
Gaby, wait...

292
00:11:35.196 --> 00:11:36.964
It's all right. Jesus Christ.

293
00:11:41.202 --> 00:11:42.770
It's fucking insane!

294
00:11:42.903 --> 00:11:44.238
Evan, what the fuck?
You're gonna fucking die!

295
00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:46.106
No, it's fine. Stay
there. Get the fuck down!

296
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.741
What the fuck?

297
00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:49.143
Evan! Evan!

298
00:11:49.276 --> 00:11:50.811
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Evan, get down!

299
00:11:52.313 --> 00:11:53.480
Fuck you!

300
00:12:01.088 --> 00:12:03.692
Got to be hundreds
more in the back!

301
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.031
Move! Get the fuck
out of the way!

302
00:12:11.165 --> 00:12:13.334
Yulia! No. Move!
Get the fuck...

303
00:12:14.468 --> 00:12:15.637
Jess.

304
00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:17.706
He's alive.

305
00:12:17.838 --> 00:12:19.507
Hey! Hey, I'm coming!

306
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.742
No, Bobby. Bobby. Hey.

307
00:12:23.077 --> 00:12:24.713
Hey! Bobby!

308
00:12:24.845 --> 00:12:27.047
Bobby! Bobby!

309
00:12:27.181 --> 00:12:28.882
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

310
00:12:40.928 --> 00:12:43.297
Fuck you! What the fuck?

311
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.266
You fuckstick!
Stop it, stop it.

312
00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:46.967
You know, you're
a fucking Muppet!

313
00:12:47.101 --> 00:12:48.235
You Jim Henson motherfucker!

314
00:12:48.369 --> 00:12:49.937
Go back to Fraggle Rock!

315
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:52.072
Nice jacket, you
Michael Jackson,

316
00:12:52.206 --> 00:12:54.341
you fucking pussy licker!

317
00:12:54.475 --> 00:12:55.776
Fuck you.

318
00:12:57.878 --> 00:13:00.548
Amanda! Amanda!

319
00:13:02.983 --> 00:13:05.219
No. No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

320
00:13:05.352 --> 00:13:07.054
No, no, no, no, no, Amanda, no.

321
00:13:07.187 --> 00:13:08.222
No.

322
00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:09.957
Amanda, look at me.

323
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:11.959
Amanda.

324
00:13:12.092 --> 00:13:13.994
Somebody help me!

325
00:13:14.128 --> 00:13:15.796
Please help me!

326
00:13:17.532 --> 00:13:18.999
Oh, my God.

327
00:13:23.103 --> 00:13:25.806
Oh! Oh, fuck!

328
00:13:25.939 --> 00:13:27.374
Stop!

329
00:13:44.358 --> 00:13:46.728
Evan, get the fuck down!

330
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.228
This is fucking
gold. You suck!

331
00:13:48.362 --> 00:13:49.597
Evan, help me!

332
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:51.265
Evan, help me! Get the...

333
00:13:51.398 --> 00:13:53.601
- Oh, my God. Holy shit.
- What the fuck?

334
00:13:53.834 --> 00:13:55.770
That was crazy. Evan,
get the fuck down.

335
00:13:55.903 --> 00:13:58.606
I've never fucking seen
something like this in my life.

336
00:14:09.016 --> 00:14:11.118
It's Thanksgiving,
not Thanksbuying!

337
00:14:11.251 --> 00:14:12.886
I'm live here at Right Mart

338
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.955
and although the
store has announced

339
00:14:15.089 --> 00:14:17.759
they will have substantial
security upgrades

340
00:14:17.891 --> 00:14:19.460
for Thanksgiving,

341
00:14:19.594 --> 00:14:23.130
many residents feel after last
year's catastrophic events,

342
00:14:23.263 --> 00:14:25.966
the store shouldn't
be open at all.

343
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.369
Thomas Wright, you
and your entire family

344
00:14:28.503 --> 00:14:29.937
have blood on your hands.

345
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:31.939
My wife's blood.

346
00:14:32.072 --> 00:14:35.309
We open for Thanksgiving, you
only hire two security guards?

347
00:14:35.442 --> 00:14:37.878
One of whom runs away and the
other is trampled to death

348
00:14:38.011 --> 00:14:40.481
in the same stampede
that killed my wife.

349
00:14:40.615 --> 00:14:43.917
You and your entire family
need to go to prison.

350
00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:45.319
Not have another sale!

351
00:14:45.452 --> 00:14:47.087
Right Mart owner,
Thomas Wright,

352
00:14:47.221 --> 00:14:49.289
has worked overtime
since last year

353
00:14:49.423 --> 00:14:51.626
to give back to the community,

354
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.863
restoring Plymouth Park
and even going so far

355
00:14:54.995 --> 00:14:57.097
as to start the Wright
Family Foundation,

356
00:14:57.231 --> 00:14:59.133
sending local kids to college.

357
00:14:59.266 --> 00:15:01.235
But many say it's not enough.

358
00:15:01.368 --> 00:15:03.904
Local pitching
phenom Bobby Di Stasi

359
00:15:04.037 --> 00:15:06.039
suffered a career-ending injury

360
00:15:06.173 --> 00:15:09.042
and has not been heard
from since the accident.

361
00:15:09.176 --> 00:15:12.012
Many lawsuits were
filed and settled,

362
00:15:12.146 --> 00:15:14.915
but the security cameras
somehow weren't working

363
00:15:15.048 --> 00:15:16.684
the night of the tragedy.

364
00:15:16.917 --> 00:15:19.119
All I know is the cameras were
functioning perfectly fine

365
00:15:19.253 --> 00:15:20.421
when I arrived.

366
00:15:20.555 --> 00:15:22.122
Then they mysteriously
stopped working

367
00:15:22.256 --> 00:15:24.425
the one night there's an
actual disaster at the store.

368
00:15:24.559 --> 00:15:26.026
How convenient.

369
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.161
Thanks, Mitch.

370
00:15:27.294 --> 00:15:28.897
Reporting live, Hank Morton

371
00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:30.899
at the Right Mart in
downtown Plymouth.

372
00:15:31.031 --> 00:15:33.367
Chet, Natalie, back to you.

373
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.870
And here you go.

374
00:15:36.003 --> 00:15:37.705
Happy Thanksgiving. Yeah.

375
00:15:39.674 --> 00:15:42.276
Good morning, Sheriff.
You want the usual?

376
00:15:42.409 --> 00:15:45.112
Two cups today, Lizzie.
New deputy's coming.

377
00:15:45.245 --> 00:15:47.448
Oh, well, he was
in here yesterday

378
00:15:47.582 --> 00:15:50.919
and, uh, he's not
much for conversation.

379
00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:52.352
Yeah. A real charmer.

380
00:15:52.486 --> 00:15:53.987
Probably just overwhelmed

381
00:15:54.121 --> 00:15:56.089
by the thriving metropolis
that is Plymouth.

382
00:15:56.223 --> 00:16:00.160
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, chills... ♪

383
00:16:04.064 --> 00:16:05.032
What the fuck?

384
00:16:05.165 --> 00:16:07.000
Fuck you.

385
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:11.972
This fish. It's organic.

386
00:16:12.105 --> 00:16:13.307
Oh, you know, all the
lobsters from the north...

387
00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.943
Here he is. Good morning.

388
00:16:15.075 --> 00:16:17.177
Good morning,
Sheriff. Welcome.

389
00:16:17.311 --> 00:16:19.480
And here you are.

390
00:16:22.282 --> 00:16:23.751
It's John Carver.
He was the first...

391
00:16:23.984 --> 00:16:26.119
First governor of
New Plymouth colony.

392
00:16:26.253 --> 00:16:28.021
Look at you. You've been doing
your homework there, Labelle.

393
00:16:28.155 --> 00:16:30.290
Well, if you call reading a
plaque on a statue homework.

394
00:16:30.424 --> 00:16:32.594
Oh, now, come on,
show some enthusiasm.

395
00:16:32.727 --> 00:16:34.896
Thanksgiving is an
institution here.

396
00:16:35.028 --> 00:16:37.297
What kid wouldn't want
to wear that, right?

397
00:16:37.431 --> 00:16:39.767
Yeah, get used to it.

398
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.636
Everybody's gonna
be wearing them.

399
00:16:43.705 --> 00:16:46.006
Yeah. I can get used to it.

400
00:16:46.139 --> 00:16:48.242
♪ But then I bury
the hatchet. ♪

401
00:16:49.443 --> 00:16:50.645
Yes!

402
00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:53.681
Let's go.

403
00:16:55.282 --> 00:16:56.518
What-what are you doing?

404
00:16:56.651 --> 00:16:57.952
Kid, what are you doing?

405
00:16:58.085 --> 00:16:59.386
I just hit top two rungs.

406
00:16:59.521 --> 00:17:01.321
That means you get to go again.

407
00:17:01.455 --> 00:17:03.123
Somebody keeps tagging
me in the video.

408
00:17:03.257 --> 00:17:04.959
Yeah, they're tagging me, too.

409
00:17:05.092 --> 00:17:06.493
God. I'm gonna report it.

410
00:17:06.628 --> 00:17:08.295
Yeah, but people
keep reposting it.

411
00:17:08.428 --> 00:17:09.597
You think someone's
doing it on purpose?

412
00:17:09.731 --> 00:17:11.164
Dude, I just won
this candy apple.

413
00:17:11.298 --> 00:17:12.600
I hit the bull's-eye like
three times in a row.

414
00:17:12.734 --> 00:17:14.434
Awesome. Good job, babe.

415
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:15.770
What?

416
00:17:16.004 --> 00:17:17.404
What is it? What did I do now?

417
00:17:17.539 --> 00:17:18.940
Evan, get the fuck down! This.

418
00:17:19.072 --> 00:17:20.274
This is fucking gold.

419
00:17:20.407 --> 00:17:22.175
I thought we were past
this. Yeah, so did I.

420
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:23.611
Well, fuck this. I'm
going back to the axe pit.

421
00:17:23.745 --> 00:17:24.612
It's safer there.

422
00:17:24.746 --> 00:17:26.346
Ev, I'm sorry.

423
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.115
I wasn't the only one
with a phone that night.

424
00:17:28.248 --> 00:17:29.249
I know you didn't post it.

425
00:17:29.383 --> 00:17:30.785
Come on, come on.

426
00:17:31.019 --> 00:17:32.820
Ugh. I have to go to
the John Carver house

427
00:17:33.086 --> 00:17:35.023
to film that stupid
commercial with my dad.

428
00:17:35.155 --> 00:17:37.157
I'm making my
grandmother's stuffing.

429
00:17:37.291 --> 00:17:40.193
Her secret ingredient
was a touch of eggplant.

430
00:17:40.327 --> 00:17:42.162
I only hope I can make it
half as good as hers, though.

431
00:17:42.296 --> 00:17:45.065
Oh, I'm sure you'll make an
excellent dinner, Kathleen.

432
00:17:45.198 --> 00:17:46.500
Hey, Jessica. Hey.

433
00:17:46.634 --> 00:17:48.536
So, you ready for your big
moment in the limelight?

434
00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.039
Oh, yeah. Already wrote
my acceptance speech.

435
00:17:51.171 --> 00:17:53.608
Ah, I have mine ready, too.

436
00:17:53.741 --> 00:17:55.442
Yours?

437
00:17:55.577 --> 00:17:56.978
Didn't your father tell you?

438
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.413
He wants a family
commercial this year.

439
00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:04.552
Look at it this way: One
more year until college.

440
00:18:04.686 --> 00:18:07.087
How am I supposed to have
an answer? I don't...

441
00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.524
I can't fucking believe this!

442
00:18:09.657 --> 00:18:11.391
I don't have an answer,
Stan. I have no idea

443
00:18:11.526 --> 00:18:12.694
what in the hell
just happened. Huh.

444
00:18:12.827 --> 00:18:14.394
Don't know what he's doing.

445
00:18:14.529 --> 00:18:16.564
It's now just a
complete disaster.

446
00:18:16.698 --> 00:18:19.299
What's going on?
You got to see this.

447
00:18:24.338 --> 00:18:26.708
This is a fucking disaster.

448
00:18:26.841 --> 00:18:28.442
The whole commercial's ruined.

449
00:18:28.576 --> 00:18:30.044
I've been screaming at
everybody the whole morning.

450
00:18:30.177 --> 00:18:32.412
Okay, guys, back up.
I got to call this in.

451
00:18:32.547 --> 00:18:33.881
Yeah, a historical
landmark has been trashed.

452
00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:35.182
What?

453
00:18:35.315 --> 00:18:36.416
Yeah, whatever. That, too.

454
00:18:36.551 --> 00:18:37.619
I got to shut this place down.

455
00:18:37.752 --> 00:18:39.053
I catch these guys,

456
00:18:39.219 --> 00:18:40.354
I'm gonna prosecute
them for vandalism.

457
00:18:40.487 --> 00:18:42.189
Uh, yeah, and theft.

458
00:18:42.322 --> 00:18:44.224
Because there was an axe on
that wall I was gonna use.

459
00:18:44.358 --> 00:18:45.627
It's gone.

460
00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.096
Come to Right Mart,
where we slash prices...

461
00:18:48.228 --> 00:18:49.396
without a fucking axe!

462
00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.264
My commercial's ruined.

463
00:18:53.601 --> 00:18:55.069
You look relieved.

464
00:18:55.202 --> 00:18:56.704
Yeah.

465
00:18:56.838 --> 00:18:58.205
I'm tired of pretending

466
00:18:58.338 --> 00:19:01.241
like everything's
normal when it's not.

467
00:19:01.375 --> 00:19:04.177
Well, hey, Jess, I want things
to go back to normal, too.

468
00:19:04.311 --> 00:19:05.445
That's why this year's
gonna be everything

469
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.048
last year was supposed to be.

470
00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.516
Dad...

471
00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:11.085
Having another sale
like nothing happened

472
00:19:11.218 --> 00:19:13.253
doesn't change anything.
It just ignores it.

473
00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:16.824
And as usual, we can't
have one moment alone.

474
00:19:18.793 --> 00:19:20.227
Hey. Hey.

475
00:19:26.701 --> 00:19:28.536

going with Jessica?

477
00:19:31.773 --> 00:19:33.373
Dude, they're amazing.

478
00:19:33.508 --> 00:19:35.910
She invited me to the
parade to be on the float,

479
00:19:36.144 --> 00:19:38.445
and then I scored an invite
to Thanksgiving dinner

480
00:19:38.579 --> 00:19:40.615
with her family at her
house. I feel like I'm in.

481
00:19:40.748 --> 00:19:43.117
Bobby ghosting her is the best
thing that ever happened to me.

482

00:21:08.503 --> 00:21:09.570
But...

528
00:21:09.704 --> 00:21:11.672
he messes with
the group dynamic.

529
00:21:11.806 --> 00:21:13.241
- Okay.
- Just be nicer.

530
00:21:13.373 --> 00:21:14.642
For me. Okay. I
just have nothing

531
00:21:14.776 --> 00:21:16.244
to talk about with the guy.

532
00:21:16.376 --> 00:21:18.378
He's just, like...
He's kind of boring.

533
00:21:18.513 --> 00:21:19.847
Well, maybe if you made
a bit of an effort.

534
00:21:19.981 --> 00:21:21.381
I mean, he's a good guy.

535
00:21:21.516 --> 00:21:22.750
Good guy.

536
00:21:22.884 --> 00:21:25.253
Well, he hasn't just
ghosted me yet, so...

537
00:21:25.385 --> 00:21:27.487
he's frontrunner.

538
00:21:28.956 --> 00:21:30.024
NPC.

539
00:21:30.258 --> 00:21:31.225
Hey. Walks like a robot.

540
00:21:31.358 --> 00:21:32.392
Talks like a robot.

541
00:21:32.527 --> 00:21:33.393
What's up, everyone? Ryan!

542
00:21:33.528 --> 00:21:34.829
Hey!

543
00:21:34.962 --> 00:21:36.396
How you doing? Hello!

544
00:21:36.531 --> 00:21:37.799
Hi, Gab. Good to see
you. Good to see you.

545
00:21:37.932 --> 00:21:39.332
You finish your paper?

546
00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:40.835
Barely.

547
00:21:40.968 --> 00:21:42.737
I had to start another
one today, and I got...

548
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.705
I'm gonna just... I'm gonna
be swamped until Christmas,

549
00:21:44.839 --> 00:21:46.240
let's just say that.

550
00:21:46.373 --> 00:21:47.374
That's crazy, bro.

551
00:21:48.576 --> 00:21:50.377
Oh, excuse me. We're
ready to order.

552
00:21:50.511 --> 00:21:52.513
This isn't Right Mart, honey.

553
00:21:52.647 --> 00:21:54.916
You actually have to
wait your turn here.

554
00:21:56.449 --> 00:21:57.718
Ooh, she told you.

555
00:21:57.852 --> 00:21:59.386
Someone's in
trouble. She told us.

556
00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.788
Uh, so, what-what are you guys

557
00:22:00.922 --> 00:22:02.723
doing for the
Pats-Steelers game?

558
00:22:02.857 --> 00:22:04.424
Probably watching at my place.

559
00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:06.093
- That sounds fun.
- You can totally do that.

560
00:22:06.326 --> 00:22:07.762
Or...

561
00:22:07.895 --> 00:22:10.565
you could watch it with
me on the 50-yard line.

562
00:22:10.698 --> 00:22:12.365
- Wait.
- What's up? Yo.

563
00:22:12.499 --> 00:22:13.734
Bro, are you serious?
I swear. Hey...

564
00:22:13.868 --> 00:22:15.069
Oh, my God. Hoo-hoo-hoo!

565
00:22:15.303 --> 00:22:16.604
Yes, sir. That's what's up.

566
00:22:16.737 --> 00:22:17.939
Scuba, you know me.
Jess, brownie points.

567
00:22:18.072 --> 00:22:19.372
Very sweet. I-I like this guy.

568
00:22:19.507 --> 00:22:20.373
This guy.

569
00:22:29.416 --> 00:22:30.818
All right.

570
00:22:30.952 --> 00:22:32.854
Are you shits ready to order?

571
00:22:32.987 --> 00:22:34.755
Yes. Uh, can I do
the vanilla frappe?

572
00:22:34.889 --> 00:22:36.456
All right. You want jimmies
on it? Extra jimmies.

573
00:22:36.591 --> 00:22:38.125
Garlic knots for the table?

574
00:22:38.358 --> 00:22:40.661
Garlic knots. This
isn't Papa Gino's, kids.

575
00:22:40.795 --> 00:22:42.495
Evan, get the fuck down!

576
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:43.831
This is fucking gold.

577
00:24:33.574 --> 00:24:36.043
Fuck. No. No!

578
00:25:15.549 --> 00:25:17.785
Where are my fucking keys?

579
00:25:17.918 --> 00:25:22.089
Where are my fucking
keys, goddamn it?!

580
00:25:22.223 --> 00:25:23.491
Fuck.

581
00:25:23.624 --> 00:25:24.859
Fuck.

582
00:25:26.794 --> 00:25:28.029
Motherfucker!

583
00:25:34.969 --> 00:25:37.271
Watch out. Here we go.
Here we go. Watch out, sir.

584
00:25:38.539 --> 00:25:40.274
Oh, my God.

585
00:25:41.776 --> 00:25:45.012
Cover that body! Cover that up.

586
00:26:10.838 --> 00:26:13.574
Yo, Jacob.

587
00:26:13.707 --> 00:26:15.142
Step into my office.

588
00:26:15.276 --> 00:26:16.844
Uh-huh.

589
00:26:19.814 --> 00:26:20.848
What's with the shades?

590
00:26:20.981 --> 00:26:22.583
I had a late night. Huh.

591
00:26:22.716 --> 00:26:23.651
What were you doing?

592
00:26:23.784 --> 00:26:26.521
Well, I had two essays to write.

593
00:26:26.687 --> 00:26:28.055
I'll hook you up next week.

594
00:26:28.189 --> 00:26:29.757
You said that last month.

595
00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:31.692
Yeah, Ms. Byers better
eat this shit up, okay?

596
00:26:31.826 --> 00:26:32.860
Trust me, Evan,
she couldn't have

597
00:26:32.993 --> 00:26:34.529
written it better herself.

598
00:26:34.662 --> 00:26:35.996
Okay.

599
00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:37.965
You're the man.

600
00:26:38.099 --> 00:26:39.800
Mm. Yeah. Brainiac.

601
00:26:39.934 --> 00:26:41.068
Eat shit.

602
00:26:43.704 --> 00:26:45.172
Oh, fuck!

603
00:26:46.774 --> 00:26:49.810
Guys, John Carver
tagged us again.

604
00:26:49.944 --> 00:26:51.679
Oh, fuck.

605
00:26:51.812 --> 00:26:53.280
Look.

606
00:26:58.319 --> 00:27:00.688
Oh, my God.

607
00:27:00.821 --> 00:27:02.823
These seats are for us.

608
00:27:02.957 --> 00:27:05.192
Our names are at the table.

609
00:27:06.861 --> 00:27:08.362
Stay behind the line.

610
00:27:08.597 --> 00:27:10.097
Oh, Sheriff, what happened?
Is this killing connected

611
00:27:10.231 --> 00:27:11.732
to what happened at Right Mart?

612
00:27:11.866 --> 00:27:13.535
Can we get this pushed
back a little bit?

613
00:27:13.667 --> 00:27:16.538
Am I walking on anything?
What do you got for me?

614
00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.372
Guys are going through
security footage inside.

615
00:27:18.607 --> 00:27:19.773
Inside? Sheriff.

616
00:27:19.907 --> 00:27:21.008
Sheriff, can you
tell us anything...

617
00:27:21.142 --> 00:27:22.343
Can you get these
guys out of the way?

618
00:27:23.711 --> 00:27:24.979
Pete.

619
00:27:25.112 --> 00:27:27.214
We found this where
the killer broke in.

620
00:27:27.348 --> 00:27:28.983
What is this?

621
00:27:29.116 --> 00:27:30.718
I think it's brick.

622
00:27:30.851 --> 00:27:32.253
Or pieces of brick. Right.

623
00:27:32.386 --> 00:27:34.054
Labelle, you've met
Detective Chu, yeah?

624
00:27:34.188 --> 00:27:35.823
Oh, yeah.

625
00:27:35.956 --> 00:27:37.658
Yeah, we met.

626
00:27:37.791 --> 00:27:39.293
Come take a look at this.

627
00:27:40.995 --> 00:27:42.229
Brick.

628
00:27:42.363 --> 00:27:44.165
We got the killer
on security cam,

629
00:27:44.298 --> 00:27:48.169
and you're not gonna
believe what he's wearing.

630
00:27:48.302 --> 00:27:50.437
Cameras at Right Mart
caught the same guy

631
00:27:50.671 --> 00:27:52.940
lowering her legs onto
the sign from the roof.

632
00:27:53.073 --> 00:27:54.643
It's just like
you said, Sheriff.

633
00:27:54.775 --> 00:27:57.945
Everyone in town's
wearing them. Yeah.

634
00:27:58.078 --> 00:27:59.680
Jess, you know me.

635
00:27:59.813 --> 00:28:01.448
I will not be bullied by
some freaking lunatic.

636
00:28:01.682 --> 00:28:03.184
The store is staying open,
and I'm hiring extra security.

637
00:28:03.317 --> 00:28:05.953
But, honey, I need you to get
to the sheriff's office now.

638
00:28:06.086 --> 00:28:07.788
I know. We're going now.
Okay, but just ask anyone

639
00:28:07.922 --> 00:28:09.023
who was there that night
to go talk to them.

640
00:28:09.156 --> 00:28:11.792
Okay, okay. Bye. I love you.

641
00:28:11.926 --> 00:28:13.460
He's hiring additional security.

642
00:28:13.694 --> 00:28:14.895
But not closing the store.

643
00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:16.797
Correct. That
would make sense.

644
00:28:16.931 --> 00:28:19.133
Wait. Wait, are you serious?

645
00:28:19.266 --> 00:28:21.702
Did your dad not see
this guy tagged us?

646
00:28:21.835 --> 00:28:23.170
Is he waiting for us to
be on a fucking display

647
00:28:23.304 --> 00:28:25.105
in front of his store?
I'm asking him right now.

648
00:28:25.239 --> 00:28:26.707
Why? Scuba, don't.

649
00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.442
Why the fuck not?
He gonna tag me,

650
00:28:28.677 --> 00:28:30.244
I'm gonna send that motherfucker
a DM. Come get me, bitch.

651
00:28:30.377 --> 00:28:31.946
Don't slide into
the killer's DMs.

652
00:28:32.079 --> 00:28:34.048
Scuba, please, just
hold off, okay?

653
00:28:34.181 --> 00:28:35.783
It's a murder case
in my dad's store.

654
00:28:35.916 --> 00:28:38.452
We can't just fuck around.
Fuck around and find out.

655
00:28:38.687 --> 00:28:40.622
- Fuck around and find out.
- That's right.

656
00:28:40.788 --> 00:28:41.789
He'll see what happens.

657
00:28:47.228 --> 00:28:48.896
Are you crazy, McCarty?
Come on, princess.

658
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:50.197
I wouldn't hit you.

659
00:28:50.331 --> 00:28:51.666
You know how much
paperwork the cops

660
00:28:51.799 --> 00:28:53.133
would make me fill out?

661
00:28:53.267 --> 00:28:54.703
McCarty, are you back
to finish tenth grade?

662
00:28:54.835 --> 00:28:56.036
I just thought, you know,

663
00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:57.706
in light of the
current situation,

664
00:28:57.838 --> 00:28:59.674
you might want a
little "protection."

665
00:28:59.807 --> 00:29:01.141
Courtesy of my old man's store.

666
00:29:01.275 --> 00:29:02.810
McCarty, only you
would have the balls

667
00:29:02.943 --> 00:29:04.245
to sell guns at a high school.

668
00:29:04.378 --> 00:29:06.013
I should kick your
ass right here.

669
00:29:06.146 --> 00:29:07.748
Come on, Mark Cuban would
think I'm a fucking genius:

670
00:29:07.881 --> 00:29:10.484
Everyone gets a
gun, problem solved.

671
00:29:10.719 --> 00:29:12.953
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, Scooby snacks.

672
00:29:13.087 --> 00:29:15.489
Jesus, I'm only kidding.

673
00:29:15.724 --> 00:29:17.858
I wouldn't sell guns to kids.

674
00:29:17.992 --> 00:29:19.360
I'm selling alcohol.

675
00:29:19.493 --> 00:29:21.295
And right now I gotta meet
that little farthead Jacob

676
00:29:21.428 --> 00:29:23.264
to sell him some more
McCarty Party tickets.

677
00:29:23.397 --> 00:29:24.699
All right, McCarty. Okay.

678
00:29:24.832 --> 00:29:26.133
Sales are going
through the roof.

679
00:29:26.267 --> 00:29:27.768
Fuck off, McCarty. No
one's coming to that.

680
00:29:27.901 --> 00:29:29.336
- You guys should
come - You're a creep.

681
00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:31.205
It's the only place in
town you won't get killed.

682
00:29:35.409 --> 00:29:38.212
I could really use
your help, Jessica.

683
00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.516
Uh, okay, what can I do?

684
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:43.183
We've exhausted pretty
much every resource

685
00:29:43.317 --> 00:29:45.185
to identify people, but anyone

686
00:29:45.319 --> 00:29:48.523
involved with that night
could be in serious danger.

687
00:29:50.991 --> 00:29:53.127
I knew I shouldn't have
let them in the store.

688
00:29:55.296 --> 00:29:58.232
Detective, can you
give us a moment? Yes.

689
00:29:58.365 --> 00:30:00.100
If you look closely, you
can see all our names.

690
00:30:00.234 --> 00:30:03.070
And-and then it's kind of
blurry, it says "Scuba."

691
00:30:04.506 --> 00:30:06.040
Why do they call you Scuba?

692
00:30:06.173 --> 00:30:08.876
My last name's Dybing.

693
00:30:09.009 --> 00:30:10.344
What's your first name?

694
00:30:10.477 --> 00:30:12.980
Claude.

695
00:30:13.113 --> 00:30:15.750
Yeah, Scuba's better.

696
00:30:15.883 --> 00:30:18.553
Jessica, you know, I
don't know what happened

697
00:30:18.787 --> 00:30:20.054
with those cameras last year,

698
00:30:20.187 --> 00:30:21.955
but at this point,
I don't care.

699
00:30:22.089 --> 00:30:26.160
Because I understand you're
in a difficult situation.

700
00:30:26.293 --> 00:30:29.263
But I know you want
to do the right thing.

701
00:30:29.396 --> 00:30:32.132
So if you know something,
anything that can help us

702
00:30:32.266 --> 00:30:34.134
with the information
on that night,

703
00:30:34.268 --> 00:30:36.437
I promise I'll
keep it between us.

704
00:30:39.006 --> 00:30:41.743
Because this is a matter
of life and death.

705
00:30:52.186 --> 00:30:53.287
Jess.

706
00:30:58.025 --> 00:30:59.426
Saw you at the Cap yesterday.

707
00:30:59.561 --> 00:31:01.428
No. I got in this morning.

708
00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:04.898
You working for
your uncle again?

709
00:31:05.032 --> 00:31:06.634
I'm helping out
while I'm in town.

710
00:31:08.603 --> 00:31:12.906
Well, I'm sure I'll
see you around.

711
00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.008
Hey, Jess, wait.

712
00:31:15.142 --> 00:31:16.544
I'm sorry.

713
00:31:18.513 --> 00:31:19.913
Can I walk with you?

714
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.123
I mean, you ghosted me.

715
00:31:29.256 --> 00:31:30.391
You're off social media.

716
00:31:30.525 --> 00:31:31.860
You deleted every
trace of yourself.

717
00:31:31.992 --> 00:31:33.360
I ghosted everybody.

718
00:31:33.494 --> 00:31:35.195
Yeah, but I'm not everybody.
I was your girlfriend.

719
00:31:35.329 --> 00:31:37.464
I blamed you for
what happened to me,

720
00:31:37.599 --> 00:31:39.199
and instead of just
telling you about it,

721
00:31:39.333 --> 00:31:40.802
I vanished, like a dick.

722
00:31:40.934 --> 00:31:44.004
I feel so stupid
now, but I just...

723
00:31:44.138 --> 00:31:46.875
Bobby, I feel horrible.

724
00:31:47.007 --> 00:31:48.877
If I hadn't let you
guys in... No, don't.

725
00:31:49.009 --> 00:31:52.379
Don't. It-it was my decision.

726
00:31:52.514 --> 00:31:54.081
I could have stayed outside.

727
00:31:55.482 --> 00:31:58.018
It's not your fault.

728
00:31:58.152 --> 00:32:00.053
How's your arm?

729
00:32:00.187 --> 00:32:01.989
I mean, rehab's going great,

730
00:32:02.122 --> 00:32:04.925
so I might get back up to
full-speed pitching again.

731
00:32:05.058 --> 00:32:06.828
Golden Arm. Yeah.

732
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.929
That's good. I'm
happy to hear it.

733
00:32:11.633 --> 00:32:15.135
Hey. What is it?

734
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:16.838
Nothing.

735
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:20.040
You know, I'm still your
friend. You can trust me.

736
00:32:21.275 --> 00:32:23.878
That night, after
the trampling,

737
00:32:24.011 --> 00:32:26.313
Kathleen was in a
panic, ranting about

738
00:32:26.447 --> 00:32:28.449
bad publicity and
getting sued, and...

739
00:32:30.384 --> 00:32:34.021
she went into the security room
and deleted all the footage.

740
00:32:34.154 --> 00:32:35.489
She asked me not
to say anything,

741
00:32:35.623 --> 00:32:37.391
and I didn't stop her.

742
00:32:37.525 --> 00:32:39.359
There's nothing you can
do about it now, so...

743
00:32:39.493 --> 00:32:41.529
That's the thing.
Maybe there is.

744
00:32:41.663 --> 00:32:43.964
Look, there's a backup
system at my house

745
00:32:44.097 --> 00:32:45.098
in my dad's office.

746
00:32:45.232 --> 00:32:47.201
Jess, that's probably long gone.

747
00:32:47.334 --> 00:32:49.069
No, it stores the
footage for a year.

748
00:32:49.203 --> 00:32:50.939
Then tell your dad
you need it, and then,

749
00:32:51.071 --> 00:32:52.105
given the circumstances,

750
00:32:52.239 --> 00:32:53.140
he prob... No, no, no, no.

751
00:32:53.273 --> 00:32:54.441
With the lawsuits, no way.

752
00:32:54.576 --> 00:32:56.210
He's pretending like
it doesn't exist.

753
00:32:56.343 --> 00:32:58.212
Well, what do you want to do?

754
00:32:58.345 --> 00:33:00.280
I want to see what's on it.

755
00:33:03.183 --> 00:33:04.117
Thanks for talking.

756
00:33:04.251 --> 00:33:06.053
Yeah. It was really nice.

757
00:33:06.186 --> 00:33:08.455
Oh, no, don't turn
around. It's Ryan Baker.

758
00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:10.157
I'll get rid of him.

759
00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:12.092
Hi, babe. Hi.

760
00:33:12.226 --> 00:33:14.562
How you doing? All
right? Yeah, yeah, fine.

761
00:33:14.696 --> 00:33:16.463
Did you, um, give
your statement?

762
00:33:16.598 --> 00:33:18.265
Yeah, I did, but they
were just looking to

763
00:33:18.398 --> 00:33:20.167
identify people, and I didn't
know anybody except Scott,

764
00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:23.938
so I didn't have
much to offer.

765
00:33:24.071 --> 00:33:25.172
How you doing, Bobby?

766
00:33:26.708 --> 00:33:28.576
Well, I'm sorry to
break up this reunion,

767
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:32.212
but, uh, Bobby, could
I see you in my office?

768
00:33:32.346 --> 00:33:33.581
This is new.

769
00:33:33.715 --> 00:33:36.751
Yep. A lot's changed
since you left.

770
00:33:36.985 --> 00:33:38.218
Looks like it.

771
00:33:39.453 --> 00:33:41.088
All right, let's
get out of here.

772
00:33:45.158 --> 00:33:46.561
Still no suspects

773
00:33:46.694 --> 00:33:49.564
in the brutal murder of local
waitress Lizzie McMullan.

774
00:33:49.697 --> 00:33:52.399
Authorities have no
clues other than cryptic

775
00:33:52.534 --> 00:33:54.134
social media posts,

776
00:33:54.268 --> 00:33:56.103
leaving many residents to wonder

777
00:33:56.236 --> 00:33:59.741
who will be the next
victim of John Carver.

778
00:34:04.311 --> 00:34:07.114
Hey, Dewey.

779
00:34:07.247 --> 00:34:09.517
Hey, buddy, Daddy's going
on a little vacation.

780
00:34:09.651 --> 00:34:11.586
All right? Going down to
the Dominican Republic,

781
00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:13.287
and Gina's gonna come
down her, all right.

782
00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.623
You just chill, buddy.

783
00:34:15.757 --> 00:34:17.491
Who the fuck is...

784
00:34:17.625 --> 00:34:19.259
Hey. Yeah.

785
00:34:19.393 --> 00:34:21.461
I'm waiting. Yeah,
man, I see you.

786
00:34:21.596 --> 00:34:23.230
I got a fucking flight.
I'll be there in a minute.

787
00:34:23.363 --> 00:34:25.198
All right?

788
00:34:25.332 --> 00:34:26.500
Jesus.

789
00:34:26.634 --> 00:34:28.435
All right, buddy.

790
00:34:37.812 --> 00:34:39.179
Fuck.

791
00:34:47.755 --> 00:34:50.290
Fuckin' passport.

792
00:34:53.393 --> 00:34:54.428
Fuck.

793
00:34:57.331 --> 00:34:58.600
Fuck.

794
00:35:01.368 --> 00:35:03.871
Jesus fucking Christ.

795
00:35:31.532 --> 00:35:33.400
Fuck.

796
00:35:44.879 --> 00:35:47.115
Show yourself!

797
00:35:47.247 --> 00:35:48.616
I'm a security guard.

798
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:51.284
I kill people every fucking day!

799
00:35:56.256 --> 00:35:58.425
Hey, I'm not scared
of you, buddy.

800
00:35:59.359 --> 00:36:00.728
Don't fuck with me!

801
00:36:05.298 --> 00:36:07.334
Let's fuckin' go!

802
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:12.640
Dewey. Dewey where
is he? Where is he?

803
00:36:12.774 --> 00:36:15.275
Tell Daddy where he is, Dewey.

804
00:36:16.343 --> 00:36:18.378
Is he that way?

805
00:37:16.871 --> 00:37:18.438
Night, Mom.

806
00:38:09.757 --> 00:38:12.026
Our killer has claimed
a second victim.

807
00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:13.795
He's brazen, confident.

808
00:38:13.928 --> 00:38:16.197
He's spent a considerable
amount of time and energy

809
00:38:16.329 --> 00:38:18.298
setting this up, but none
of this works unless he has

810
00:38:18.431 --> 00:38:19.801
a private location where
he's taking the victims.

811
00:38:19.934 --> 00:38:22.036
He's powering off his phone

812
00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:23.303
so we can't track
him on the move.

813
00:38:23.436 --> 00:38:24.772
He's taking the picture

814
00:38:24.906 --> 00:38:27.208
and then uploading it
from another location.

815
00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:28.876
We have one bit of physical
evidence that leads us

816
00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:30.410
to Cordage Park.

817
00:38:31.512 --> 00:38:32.613
Effective immediately,

818
00:38:32.747 --> 00:38:34.749
we're searching
every inch of it.

819
00:39:21.428 --> 00:39:23.731
Hey. Oh, hi, Dad.

820
00:39:23.865 --> 00:39:26.601
I was just using your computer.
Oh, it's fine. Listen...

821
00:39:28.536 --> 00:39:30.905
I've been thinking a
lot about what you said.

822
00:39:31.038 --> 00:39:33.708
You know, after Mom died,

823
00:39:33.841 --> 00:39:37.745
the only thing that I could
do to survive was work.

824
00:39:37.879 --> 00:39:39.614
Because it's all I know.

825
00:39:39.747 --> 00:39:41.883
But work...

826
00:39:42.016 --> 00:39:43.885
doesn't fill the void.

827
00:39:44.018 --> 00:39:46.419
So, when I met Kathleen,

828
00:39:46.554 --> 00:39:48.756
I felt alive again. I was...

829
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:51.292
willing to just
overlook all flaws

830
00:39:51.424 --> 00:39:53.460
and it might've...

831
00:39:53.594 --> 00:39:54.929
been at your expense.

832
00:39:56.097 --> 00:39:57.965
And I just want to say...

833
00:39:59.667 --> 00:40:00.768
I'm sorry.

834
00:40:03.771 --> 00:40:04.772
Thank you.

835
00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:07.675
Love you, Dad.

836
00:40:07.808 --> 00:40:09.143
Love you.

837
00:40:13.446 --> 00:40:14.615
You find anything?

838
00:40:14.749 --> 00:40:16.483
Yeah. Let's go.

839
00:40:16.617 --> 00:40:17.618
Wait, what is it?

840
00:40:17.752 --> 00:40:19.553
Nothing. Let's just go.

841
00:40:24.491 --> 00:40:25.593
I know this kid.

842
00:40:25.726 --> 00:40:27.028
Lionel. He goes to our school.

843
00:40:27.161 --> 00:40:29.030
He's always the
turkey in the parade.

844
00:40:29.163 --> 00:40:30.932
And I-I know that guy.

845
00:40:31.065 --> 00:40:32.566
He goes to Hanover South.

846
00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:33.968
- Evan punched him, remember?
- Yeah,

847
00:40:34.101 --> 00:40:35.603
he's the one who
started the riot.

848
00:40:35.736 --> 00:40:37.004
He had the bullhorn.

849
00:40:37.138 --> 00:40:38.606
I think his name is...

850
00:40:38.739 --> 00:40:40.841
Larry? Or Lonnie?

851
00:40:40.975 --> 00:40:42.209
Or-Or something.

852
00:40:42.442 --> 00:40:44.211
And she's probably
a cheerleader.

853
00:40:44.444 --> 00:40:47.014
That's great, Bobby. Thank you.

854
00:40:47.148 --> 00:40:48.683
Yeah.

855
00:40:50.785 --> 00:40:52.520
Hey, w-what is it?

856
00:40:54.522 --> 00:40:56.157
There's one more.

857
00:41:04.031 --> 00:41:05.700
That's Ryan Baker.

858
00:41:05.833 --> 00:41:09.203
He didn't know anyone other
than his roommate, huh?

859
00:41:09.437 --> 00:41:10.705
And that's Doug.

860
00:41:10.838 --> 00:41:12.573
The guard that got
crushed to death.

861
00:41:12.707 --> 00:41:15.810
Jessica, did Ryan ever mention
to you that he knew Doug?

862
00:41:15.943 --> 00:41:19.180
Because that certainly
wasn't in his statement.

863
00:41:19.447 --> 00:41:20.247
No.

864
00:41:21.515 --> 00:41:22.917
Yeah.

865
00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:25.152
There may not be anything to it.

866
00:41:26.887 --> 00:41:28.956
Be careful who you
trust. Both of you.

867
00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:30.558
Yeah, don't worry.

868
00:41:30.691 --> 00:41:31.859
I'll take care of Ryan today.

869
00:41:31.993 --> 00:41:33.060
You're not taking
care of anything.

870
00:41:33.194 --> 00:41:34.395
He just said it
could be nothing.

871
00:41:34.528 --> 00:41:35.930
All right, fine, Jess.

872
00:41:36.063 --> 00:41:38.466
If I see Ryan, I'll act
like nothing's weird.

873
00:41:38.599 --> 00:41:39.667
For you.

874
00:41:41.469 --> 00:41:42.903
You should get back to school.

875
00:41:43.037 --> 00:41:44.538
But stay alert.

876
00:41:44.672 --> 00:41:46.674
That's why I won't be
celebrating Thanksgiving

877
00:41:46.807 --> 00:41:49.076
this year or any year.

878
00:41:50.811 --> 00:41:53.514
You're so brave. So brave.

879
00:41:53.647 --> 00:41:54.815
Thank you, Chad.

880
00:41:54.949 --> 00:41:57.118
That was very inspiring.

881
00:41:58.753 --> 00:42:00.654
Next up...

882
00:42:02.256 --> 00:42:03.424
Mr. Fletcher.

883
00:42:03.557 --> 00:42:04.725
Let's go, Fletcher.

884
00:42:04.859 --> 00:42:06.761
All right.

885
00:42:08.996 --> 00:42:10.131
Um...

886
00:42:10.264 --> 00:42:12.800
the piece that I have written...

887
00:42:12.933 --> 00:42:16.037
uh, is titled "The Wampanoag

888
00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:18.706
and the Native American
Side of Thanksgiving,"

889
00:42:18.839 --> 00:42:20.307
by Evan Fletcher.

890
00:42:21.675 --> 00:42:22.910
"While today Thanksgiving

891
00:42:23.044 --> 00:42:25.746
"is one of our nation's
favorite holidays,

892
00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:27.114
"it has a very different meaning

893
00:42:27.248 --> 00:42:29.083
"for many Native Americans.

894
00:42:29.216 --> 00:42:30.818
"For the Wampanoag,

895
00:42:30.951 --> 00:42:32.920
Thanksgiving is a
day of mourning."

896
00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:38.159
That was beautiful, Evan.

897
00:42:38.292 --> 00:42:40.127
I enjoyed hearing you read it.

898
00:42:42.096 --> 00:42:45.499
As much as I enjoyed
writing it for my blog.

899
00:43:01.749 --> 00:43:03.050
I'm gonna kill that
little asswipe.

900
00:43:03.184 --> 00:43:04.685
If it makes you feel any
better, you'll probably

901
00:43:04.819 --> 00:43:06.320
be killed before you get
suspended for plagiarism.

902
00:43:06.555 --> 00:43:08.689
Scuba. Don't even
joke about that.

903
00:43:08.823 --> 00:43:10.991
Yeah, my bad, you're right.
Plagiarism's serious.

904
00:43:13.027 --> 00:43:14.628
When did you talk to him last?

905
00:43:14.762 --> 00:43:16.363
- Two days ago.
- Was there a reason?

906
00:43:16.597 --> 00:43:18.365
Yeah, there's a reason.

907
00:43:18.599 --> 00:43:20.101
I never bought Ryan's
Mr. Perfect routine.

908
00:43:20.234 --> 00:43:22.336
Yeah, I mean, how would he
know a random security guard

909
00:43:22.571 --> 00:43:23.971
and why would he
not tell anybody?

910
00:43:24.105 --> 00:43:25.606
I don't know.

911
00:43:25.739 --> 00:43:27.608
Doug just moved here.
He was the new guy.

912
00:43:27.741 --> 00:43:29.176
This guy have any
family in Plymouth?

913
00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:30.845
I think his family's
in Nebraska.

914
00:43:30.978 --> 00:43:32.880
I-I don't believe for
a second it was Ryan.

915
00:43:33.013 --> 00:43:34.648
Doesn't make sense.
He's too nice.

916
00:43:34.782 --> 00:43:36.117
Okay, let's not be naive here.

917
00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:38.219
I mean, the nicest guys
are the most psycho,

918
00:43:38.352 --> 00:43:39.687
they're just better
at hiding it.

919
00:43:43.657 --> 00:43:45.192
- God, what is wrong with me?
- It's not you.

920
00:43:45.326 --> 00:43:46.660
Nothing wrong with you, Jess.

921
00:43:46.794 --> 00:43:48.597
I feel like I can't
trust anybody.

922
00:43:48.729 --> 00:43:50.164
You're probably right.

923
00:43:50.297 --> 00:43:51.899
I mean, us.

924
00:43:52.032 --> 00:43:52.967
It's all we got right now.

925
00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.935
And, yes, I am excluding Bobby.

926
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:57.606
Bobby? Wh...
Bobby would never.

927
00:43:57.738 --> 00:43:59.140
I told you, he was doing great.

928
00:43:59.273 --> 00:44:01.008
No, you told us he told
you he was doing great.

929
00:44:01.142 --> 00:44:02.376
That's different than
he's doing great.

930
00:44:02.611 --> 00:44:04.011
For all we know, he's
not even at school,

931
00:44:04.145 --> 00:44:05.646
and he's driving around in
that tow truck full time.

932
00:44:05.779 --> 00:44:07.549
Wait, hey, hey. Why are we
even talking about them?

933
00:44:07.681 --> 00:44:10.151
It's got to be Mitch. I mean,
he's obsessed with the store,

934
00:44:10.284 --> 00:44:12.052
his wife just died,
and he hates us.

935
00:44:12.186 --> 00:44:14.421
That's right! Yo, that guy's
up to his eyeballs in motive.

936
00:44:14.655 --> 00:44:16.056
And he drives a van:

937
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:17.858
the official transportation
choice for pedophiles,

938
00:44:17.992 --> 00:44:19.594
kidnappers, rapists,
murderers...

939
00:44:19.727 --> 00:44:20.761
Yep, yep, you're right,
you're right. Scuba.

940
00:44:20.895 --> 00:44:22.196
Like Coach Ingalls says,

941
00:44:22.329 --> 00:44:24.064
the best defense
is a good offense.

942
00:44:24.198 --> 00:44:25.600
Me and you, we go after them,

943
00:44:25.733 --> 00:44:27.434
fuck them up one by
one. Let's go, let's go.

944
00:44:27.668 --> 00:44:29.203
And we'll get some, we'll get
some help from McCarty's store.

945
00:44:29.336 --> 00:44:31.939
Guys. Evan. Babe. This
is not a game, okay?

946
00:44:32.072 --> 00:44:33.874
These are not some Hanover kids.

947
00:44:36.911 --> 00:44:39.413
Can we just let the
police handle it, Ev?

948
00:44:41.382 --> 00:44:43.717
We're in deep shit here.

949
00:44:43.851 --> 00:44:47.688
We let the police handle it,
we're all gonna end up 50% off.

950
00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.629
Are you gonna answer it?

951
00:44:54.762 --> 00:44:56.463
No.

952
00:45:08.342 --> 00:45:09.877
This fits.

953
00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:11.412
You're on the Right
Mart "Mayflower"?

954
00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:13.080
Yep.

955
00:45:13.214 --> 00:45:14.215
Next.

956
00:45:25.125 --> 00:45:26.827
Bobby boy.

957
00:45:26.961 --> 00:45:28.963
Forgotten, but not gone.

958
00:45:29.096 --> 00:45:31.165
Forgotten?

959
00:45:31.298 --> 00:45:32.766
It feels like I never left.

960
00:45:34.703 --> 00:45:35.704
You in the parade now?

961
00:45:35.836 --> 00:45:36.904
Yeah, Jess asked me.

962
00:45:37.938 --> 00:45:39.106
Newlon was right, you know.

963
00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:40.808
A lot has changed
since you left.

964
00:45:40.941 --> 00:45:43.010
Ah, maybe not as
much as you think.

965
00:45:43.143 --> 00:45:44.912
What's that supposed to mean?

966
00:45:45.045 --> 00:45:48.315
Oh, no, I just mean that I'm
helping with the parade again.

967
00:45:48.449 --> 00:45:49.950
Hmm.

968
00:45:50.084 --> 00:45:51.952
You know, if you weren't
leaving in a few days,

969
00:45:52.086 --> 00:45:53.954
I would knock your teeth out.

970
00:45:54.088 --> 00:45:55.523
Whoa, leaving?

971
00:45:55.789 --> 00:45:56.490
Buddy...

972
00:45:58.392 --> 00:46:00.528
Who says I'm leaving?

973
00:46:07.736 --> 00:46:09.203
You fucking pussy.

974
00:46:09.336 --> 00:46:11.138
You fucking want it.
Let's fucking go.

975
00:46:11.272 --> 00:46:12.741
One more. One more!

976
00:46:12.873 --> 00:46:16.210
There you fucking go! Nice!

977
00:46:16.343 --> 00:46:18.178
The fuck's going on here?

978
00:46:18.312 --> 00:46:20.014
Come on, Hanover.

979
00:46:20.147 --> 00:46:21.815
We gonna carve up Plymouth
like a turkey tomorrow or what?

980
00:46:21.949 --> 00:46:24.351
Let's go! Harder!

981
00:46:24.485 --> 00:46:25.953
Harder! One more time!

982
00:46:26.086 --> 00:46:28.889
Fuck yeah! Looking
good, cover girl.

983
00:46:29.023 --> 00:46:32.092

Shh.

Coach has strict

993
00:46:59.153 --> 00:47:00.254
No sex.

994
00:47:00.387 --> 00:47:02.923
Just a little tease.

995
00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.194
Sit.

996
00:47:07.328 --> 00:47:09.029
What, here?

997
00:47:13.233 --> 00:47:14.435
What?

00:47:14.569 --> 00:47:17.605
You're fucking

Are you ready?

1000
00:47:33.187 --> 00:47:35.155
Fucking born ready.

1001
00:47:35.289 --> 00:47:36.591
Jesus.

1002
00:47:38.359 --> 00:47:41.195
Are you sure?

1003
00:47:50.237 --> 00:47:52.973
Here we go!

1004
00:48:01.014 --> 00:48:02.650
Fucking cancelled?

1005
00:48:02.883 --> 00:48:03.852
What the fuck? Relax.

1006
00:48:03.984 --> 00:48:05.319
You can't cancel my game!

1007
00:48:05.452 --> 00:48:07.488
You heard the man.
Let's go, Fletcher.

1008
00:48:07.622 --> 00:48:09.289
Game's getting rescheduled.
Let's get changed.

1009
00:48:09.423 --> 00:48:10.525
Rescheduled until
when? Until when?

1010
00:48:10.658 --> 00:48:12.326
June? Someone's missing.

1011
00:48:12.459 --> 00:48:13.828
I'm gonna be fucking
graduated by then, bro!

1012
00:48:13.961 --> 00:48:14.863
Where you going?
I'm gonna go play,

1013
00:48:14.995 --> 00:48:16.263
that's what I'm gonna do!

1014
00:48:16.397 --> 00:48:18.031
Dude, you can't play
football alone, dumbass.

1015
00:48:18.165 --> 00:48:19.466
Watch me!

1016
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:24.639
Blunderbuss!

1017
00:48:24.873 --> 00:48:26.306
McCarty, what the
fuck are you doing?

1018
00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.475
I was just gonna fire it
off if they won the game.

1019
00:48:28.610 --> 00:48:30.077
It's just fucking
gunpowder, it's all right.

1020
00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:33.080
Sorry, Sheriff. My
kid's a fucking idiot.

1021
00:48:33.213 --> 00:48:35.349
- He's a fucking goober chucker.
- Get in the car,

1022
00:48:35.482 --> 00:48:36.851
you fucking idiot. God,
I hate those things.

1023
00:48:36.984 --> 00:48:38.085
I can't even smell the powder.

1024
00:48:38.218 --> 00:48:40.187
First commercial
my dad made me do,

1025
00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:41.455
he took it so seriously

1026
00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:42.956
he insisted I learn
how to pack it.

1027
00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:44.191
He made me do it
over and over again.

1028
00:48:44.324 --> 00:48:45.860
Almost blew up in my hand.

1029
00:48:45.993 --> 00:48:47.361
Jess, you should go home.

1030
00:48:47.494 --> 00:48:49.697
Gaby, maybe go find Evan,
get him out of here.

1031
00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:51.965
I heard they found blood.

1032
00:48:52.099 --> 00:48:53.400
Yeah.

1033
00:48:53.535 --> 00:48:55.302
The people missing
were at the Right Mart.

1034
00:48:55.436 --> 00:48:57.906
You stay together, or
at least in pairs, okay?

1035
00:48:58.038 --> 00:48:59.908
Okay, yeah. Shit.

1036
00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:02.376
I'll go get him. Okay,
I'll meet you inside.

1037
00:49:18.526 --> 00:49:20.461
Hey, I can leave, you guys.

1038
00:49:20.595 --> 00:49:22.463
Oh, no, no, no. Let's
go back together.

1039
00:49:22.597 --> 00:49:23.997
Hmm? We'll be right back.

1040
00:49:24.131 --> 00:49:25.432
Yeah, wait up. Okay.

1041
00:49:31.606 --> 00:49:33.106
Okay.

1042
00:50:03.403 --> 00:50:04.371
That's weird.

1043
00:50:47.481 --> 00:50:49.149
Gabs.

1044
00:50:51.719 --> 00:50:53.086
Gaby?

1045
00:51:03.631 --> 00:51:04.799
Gaby?

1046
00:53:47.729 --> 00:53:48.996
Help! Help!

1047
00:53:49.229 --> 00:53:50.297
He's in there! Please help!

1048
00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:52.967
Help! Help!

1049
00:53:53.201 --> 00:53:54.736
Please help!

1050
00:54:04.311 --> 00:54:07.181
Did you notice
anything about him?

1051
00:54:07.314 --> 00:54:08.783
Um...

1052
00:54:08.916 --> 00:54:11.853
He was dressed as a pilgrim.

1053
00:54:11.986 --> 00:54:14.622
And-and he had a
John Carver mask on.

1054
00:54:14.756 --> 00:54:17.692
Okay. Just think. It's
about the details.

1055
00:54:17.825 --> 00:54:19.326
Small mistakes,

1056
00:54:19.459 --> 00:54:20.995
that's how they get caught.

1057
00:54:21.229 --> 00:54:22.429
I'm sorry, I...

1058
00:54:22.563 --> 00:54:24.464
I only saw him
for a few seconds.

1059
00:54:24.599 --> 00:54:26.200
I'm sorry. It's okay.
It's okay. Don't be sorry.

1060
00:54:26.333 --> 00:54:28.002
Okay. Okay, we're
gonna get you home.

1061
00:54:28.236 --> 00:54:29.804
You're doing great. Okay.

1062
00:54:29.937 --> 00:54:31.371
Thank you. All right.

1063
00:54:31.506 --> 00:54:32.640
You guys good? Yeah.

1064
00:54:32.774 --> 00:54:34.542
We got to get you
guys home soon, okay?

1065
00:54:34.675 --> 00:54:35.877
Get out of here.

1066
00:54:37.912 --> 00:54:39.346
Hey, Bobby's coming.

1067
00:54:39.479 --> 00:54:41.816
Hey, is she...? Hey.

1068
00:54:41.949 --> 00:54:44.719
Are you okay?
Here, here, here.

1069
00:54:44.852 --> 00:54:45.720
Thanks.

1070
00:54:45.853 --> 00:54:48.388
That's my girlfriend. Jess.

1071
00:54:48.523 --> 00:54:50.658
He came right for
me. Did you see him?

1072
00:54:50.792 --> 00:54:52.359
- Hi.
- You okay?

1073
00:54:52.492 --> 00:54:54.629
Yeah. Yeah.

1074
00:54:54.762 --> 00:54:56.697
He came after me,
but I got away.

1075
00:54:56.831 --> 00:54:58.800
Douche.

1076
00:54:58.933 --> 00:55:01.235
That's been happening
a lot here recently.

1077
00:55:01.368 --> 00:55:02.737
I wonder why.

1078
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:04.906
Okay, you want to tell us
about your little buddy,

1079
00:55:05.039 --> 00:55:06.439
the security guard?

1080
00:55:07.875 --> 00:55:10.244
I'm sorry, who? Dude,
stop lying to her, man.

1081
00:55:10.377 --> 00:55:12.379
Just like how you
lied to the cops.

1082
00:55:12.513 --> 00:55:13.815
Going to the corner,
huddled together?

1083
00:55:13.948 --> 00:55:15.716
I'm sorry, are you talking
about the security guard

1084
00:55:15.850 --> 00:55:17.618
from-from Right Mart? Doug?

1085
00:55:17.752 --> 00:55:19.486
We have proof. It's
on video, dude.

1086
00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:21.321
You are a fucking idiot, man.

1087
00:55:21.454 --> 00:55:22.790
I honestly hope you
make a better pitcher

1088
00:55:22.924 --> 00:55:23.891
than you do a detective.

1089
00:55:24.025 --> 00:55:25.560
No, I walked off with him

1090
00:55:25.693 --> 00:55:27.295
because we were getting addies.

1091
00:55:27.427 --> 00:55:29.096
That's why Scott was there.

1092
00:55:29.329 --> 00:55:32.066
I was just bro-ing up with him
'cause I needed another hookup.

1093
00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:34.702
Adderall? "Adderall?"

1094
00:55:34.836 --> 00:55:35.803
Yes, Adderall.

1095
00:55:35.937 --> 00:55:37.605
That is what smart kids do,

1096
00:55:37.738 --> 00:55:39.841
so we can get into Ivy League
schools, and guys like you

1097
00:55:39.974 --> 00:55:41.542
can tow our
Porsches. Get your...

1098
00:55:41.676 --> 00:55:43.277
Bitch! Hey, hey, hey.

1099
00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:44.579
Yo, what the fuck? Hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1100
00:55:44.712 --> 00:55:45.646
Get the fuck off. Ryan!

1101
00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:46.881
Get home, both of you.

1102
00:55:47.014 --> 00:55:47.915
I didn't... And
stay the fuck away

1103
00:55:48.049 --> 00:55:49.349
from the parade tomorrow.

1104
00:55:49.482 --> 00:55:50.417
I see either one of
you on the street,

1105
00:55:50.551 --> 00:55:51.819
I'm gonna haul you both in.

1106
00:55:51.953 --> 00:55:53.521
Jess, I'm not the
bad guy here. Go.

1107
00:55:53.654 --> 00:55:54.822
He came at me.
This isn't done.

1108
00:55:54.956 --> 00:55:56.389
He just, he just
came at me. No. Stop!

1109
00:55:56.524 --> 00:55:57.892
Stop!

1110
00:55:58.025 --> 00:55:59.794
I can't believe you two.

1111
00:55:59.927 --> 00:56:01.361
My friends could be dead,

1112
00:56:01.494 --> 00:56:03.264
and you can't put
your bullshit aside?

1113
00:56:03.396 --> 00:56:04.966
I don't want to
see either of you.

1114
00:56:05.099 --> 00:56:06.767
Okay?

1115
00:56:06.901 --> 00:56:08.269
Get out. Jess,
that is not what...

1116
00:56:08.401 --> 00:56:09.670
Get out!

1117
00:56:12.006 --> 00:56:13.440
Shit. It's my dad.

1118
00:56:14.642 --> 00:56:15.676
Yulia.

1119
00:56:16.777 --> 00:56:17.912
Yulia, come.

1120
00:56:18.045 --> 00:56:20.380
I... I...

1121
00:56:20.514 --> 00:56:21.582
Papa. Get in.

1122
00:56:21.716 --> 00:56:22.950
What are you doing? Pop.

1123
00:56:23.084 --> 00:56:24.819
- Get in the Mercedes.
- Dad!

1124
00:56:24.952 --> 00:56:27.420
Just tell me where
we're going. Florida.

1125
00:56:31.525 --> 00:56:32.994
He's just taking
her to Florida?

1126
00:56:33.127 --> 00:56:34.494
I don't know.

1127
00:56:34.629 --> 00:56:35.930
That's about as much
of a conversation

1128
00:56:36.063 --> 00:56:38.532
I've ever had with the guy.

1129
00:56:40.433 --> 00:56:41.602
What?

1130
00:56:41.736 --> 00:56:42.937
Evan's right.

1131
00:56:43.070 --> 00:56:45.640
The police ain't
doing shit. Let's go.

1132
00:56:45.773 --> 00:56:47.008
Where are we going?

1133
00:56:50.511 --> 00:56:53.681
Ladies and gentlemen,
another satisfied customer.

1134
00:56:53.814 --> 00:56:55.950
Jacob, get him a T-shirt.

1135
00:56:57.385 --> 00:56:59.120
Here you go, buddy.
On the house.

1136
00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:04.659
Hey, listen, I just want
to know if it's worth it

1137
00:57:04.792 --> 00:57:06.727
before we pay.

1138
00:57:06.861 --> 00:57:09.429
I mean, I heard this party
isn't even all that, so...

1139
00:57:09.563 --> 00:57:12.566
Listen, kid.

1140
00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:14.869
Sometimes things end up much
better than you'd expect,

1141
00:57:15.002 --> 00:57:16.404
all right?

1142
00:57:16.537 --> 00:57:17.972
Think of it this way,

1143
00:57:18.105 --> 00:57:20.341
when Black Sabbath
fired Ozzy in '79,

1144
00:57:20.473 --> 00:57:21.676
you would've figured it
was all fucking over.

1145
00:57:21.809 --> 00:57:23.177
The end of an era.

1146
00:57:23.411 --> 00:57:27.949
But then, along comes
Ronnie James Dio,

1147
00:57:28.082 --> 00:57:31.585
all five foot nothing of
him, the evil little elf,

1148
00:57:31.719 --> 00:57:33.521
and he brought a
magic to that band

1149
00:57:33.654 --> 00:57:35.156
that they hadn't seen in years.

1150
00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:37.558
Who's Black Sabbath?

1151
00:57:38.659 --> 00:57:39.894
Get the fuck off my property.

1152
00:57:40.027 --> 00:57:41.595
I just want to
know. Who's Black...

1153
00:57:41.729 --> 00:57:43.496
Get the fuck off my
property right now.

1154
00:57:43.631 --> 00:57:44.932
Go back to Methuen,
you fucking dorks.

1155
00:57:45.066 --> 00:57:47.234
Fuck you. No virgins allowed.

1156
00:57:47.467 --> 00:57:49.469
Cocksucker.

1157
00:57:50.738 --> 00:57:52.740
Jacob. VIP. Upstairs. Now.

1158
00:57:52.873 --> 00:57:53.808
All right.

1159
00:57:55.743 --> 00:57:58.913
♪ Will he survive, will he
survive, will he survive ♪

1160
00:57:59.046 --> 00:58:00.915
♪ Will he survive the sword? ♪

1161
00:58:01.048 --> 00:58:03.217
Watch out, this kid's
been here for two days.

1162
00:58:03.451 --> 00:58:04.852
Drank too much white zinfandel.

1163
00:58:08.055 --> 00:58:09.256
Welcome to the Death Star.

1164
00:58:09.489 --> 00:58:11.025
This is where the magic happens.

1165
00:58:11.158 --> 00:58:13.627
- Jacob, VIP's closed.
- Yeah.

1166
00:58:13.761 --> 00:58:15.096
You're on door patrol.

1167
00:58:18.199 --> 00:58:21.068
You get caught with any of
this shit, you're on your own.

1168
00:58:23.637 --> 00:58:25.940
Jesus, Scuba. What about this?

1169
00:58:26.073 --> 00:58:27.808
That's mainly for taking
down angry grizzlies

1170
00:58:27.942 --> 00:58:29.910
in the Alaskan wilderness
or brain-eating zombies

1171
00:58:30.044 --> 00:58:32.847
in a post-apocalyptic America.

1172
00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:34.548
All right.

1173
00:58:34.682 --> 00:58:36.751
Let me show you something
far more reasonable.

1174
00:58:41.188 --> 00:58:43.958
.44 Magnum. A classic.

1175
00:58:44.091 --> 00:58:45.693
Plus, you get bonus
points if you make

1176
00:58:45.826 --> 00:58:47.128
a Dirty Harry-style
comment when you blast him.

1177
00:58:47.261 --> 00:58:50.264
Mc-McCarty, do you have
any human-sized guns?

1178
00:58:50.498 --> 00:58:51.832
Maybe.

1179
00:59:00.509 --> 00:59:01.510
All right.

1180
00:59:01.642 --> 00:59:03.978
The SIG 226.

1181
00:59:04.111 --> 00:59:07.048
It's a short recoil-operated,
locked breech pistol.

1182
00:59:07.181 --> 00:59:09.750
Decent stopping power.

1183
00:59:09.884 --> 00:59:11.520
You'll want to use this.

1184
00:59:11.652 --> 00:59:12.987
Keep the safety on,

1185
00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.955
unless you want to
blow your nuts off.

1186
00:59:15.089 --> 00:59:16.657
What about you, Right Mart?

1187
00:59:16.791 --> 00:59:19.528
Uh, I fired a musket
once. It almost killed me.

1188
00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:21.028
Yeah, those things are fucked.

1189
00:59:21.162 --> 00:59:23.130
Let me show you something.

1190
00:59:24.932 --> 00:59:26.801
Check this out.

1191
00:59:26.934 --> 00:59:28.537
Element of surprise, huh?

1192
00:59:28.669 --> 00:59:29.737
Pull it out of your belt

1193
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:31.072
and you stick 'em
right in the gut.

1194
00:59:31.205 --> 00:59:32.507
We got all sorts
of tactical shit.

1195
00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:33.874
It's yours if you want it.

1196
00:59:34.008 --> 00:59:35.810
Um, I'm-I'm good.

1197
00:59:35.943 --> 00:59:38.012
Scuba will be with me,
and he's armed, so...

1198
00:59:38.145 --> 00:59:39.847
All right.

1199
00:59:42.683 --> 00:59:45.186
McCarty, I owe you one.

1200
00:59:45.319 --> 00:59:47.988
Yeah. Anytime.

1201
00:59:48.122 --> 00:59:49.824
All right. Thanks.

1202
00:59:49.957 --> 00:59:51.826
Yeah.

1203
00:59:51.959 --> 00:59:53.661
Scuba. Jess.

1204
00:59:53.794 --> 00:59:55.629
Be careful out there, huh?

1205
00:59:55.763 --> 00:59:58.299
Keep yourself alive long
enough to return that thing.

1206
01:00:00.768 --> 01:00:02.369
I don't know what you think

1207
01:00:02.603 --> 01:00:03.904
you're gonna do with a gun.
It's for protection, baby.

1208
01:00:04.038 --> 01:00:05.606
You've never even
held one before.

1209
01:00:05.739 --> 01:00:07.074
You've never seen one before.

1210
01:00:07.208 --> 01:00:09.176
If you really want
someone to come and help,

1211
01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:11.378
I'm sure my dad can, like,
call the sheriff's department

1212
01:00:11.612 --> 01:00:13.180
and send a cop over.
There's one here right now.

1213
01:00:13.314 --> 01:00:14.682
Hey, can I come by?

1214
01:00:14.815 --> 01:00:16.183
Um, okay, I'm packing right now

1215
01:00:16.317 --> 01:00:18.919
'cause I'm going to
Florida, apparently, so...

1216
01:00:19.053 --> 01:00:20.821
Okay, I don't know
when I'll be back,

1217
01:00:20.955 --> 01:00:22.756
but I'm a little stressed, okay?

1218
01:00:22.890 --> 01:00:24.024
I'll call you back later.

1219
01:00:24.158 --> 01:00:25.759
Okay. Call me from the car.

1220
01:00:25.893 --> 01:00:27.328
Geez.

1221
01:00:28.597 --> 01:00:31.132
For you. Enjoy.

1222
01:00:31.265 --> 01:00:33.033
Thank you. You sure?

1223
01:00:33.167 --> 01:00:35.537
Eat it. We are
going to Florida.

1224
01:00:35.669 --> 01:00:37.938
Appreciate it.

1225
01:00:38.072 --> 01:00:40.875
When's the, uh,
the remodel done?

1226
01:00:41.008 --> 01:00:42.776
Never.

1227
01:00:59.827 --> 01:01:00.794
Dad?

1228
01:01:07.735 --> 01:01:09.003
Dad?

1229
01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.148
Dad?

1230
01:01:41.168 --> 01:01:42.870
Dad!

1231
01:01:44.205 --> 01:01:45.674
Jesus, Dad.

1232
01:01:45.806 --> 01:01:46.941
What the hell?

1233
01:01:47.074 --> 01:01:48.809
Car is coming. Finish.

1234
01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:53.080
Okay. Trying to.

1235
01:01:53.214 --> 01:01:56.850
Fucking contact.

1236
01:01:59.853 --> 01:02:01.822
What the hell?

1237
01:02:05.059 --> 01:02:06.193
Yulia!

1238
01:02:07.461 --> 01:02:09.129
Dad, I'm coming.

1239
01:02:17.071 --> 01:02:18.806
Jesus, what now?

1240
01:02:20.808 --> 01:02:21.942
Hey, baby.

1241
01:02:22.076 --> 01:02:23.344
Hey, what's up?

1242
01:02:23.477 --> 01:02:25.246
My dad's, like, freaking
out at me right now.

1243
01:02:25.379 --> 01:02:26.947
We have to leave in,
like, five minutes.

1244
01:02:27.081 --> 01:02:28.349
Okay, yeah, yeah,
no problem, uh...

1245
01:02:28.482 --> 01:02:31.051
Okay. Well, I'll call
you from the car.

1246
01:02:31.185 --> 01:02:33.153
I love you.

1247
01:02:36.490 --> 01:02:37.825
Fuck! Fuck!

1248
01:02:37.958 --> 01:02:38.926
- Scuba, go!
- No!

1249
01:02:39.059 --> 01:02:40.528
Yulia!

1250
01:02:40.761 --> 01:02:42.664
No! Fuck no! Yulia!

1251
01:02:42.796 --> 01:02:44.898
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1252
01:02:45.032 --> 01:02:46.767
- No!
- No! Fuck!

1253
01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:48.068
Yulia! Fuck!

1254
01:03:01.382 --> 01:03:03.518
Dad! Dad!

1255
01:03:05.886 --> 01:03:08.856
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1256
01:03:10.357 --> 01:03:12.092
No, no!

1257
01:03:15.764 --> 01:03:18.132
Yulia! Yulia! Yulia!

1258
01:03:20.801 --> 01:03:23.037
Oh, fuck. Yulia!

1259
01:03:23.170 --> 01:03:25.774
Scuba! Hurry up! Hurry! Yulia!

1260
01:03:25.906 --> 01:03:26.807
Scuba!

1261
01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:28.075
Yulia! Yulia!

1262
01:03:28.208 --> 01:03:31.111
Scuba, help me.

1263
01:03:31.245 --> 01:03:33.581
Let her fucking go. Scuba,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

1264
01:03:33.814 --> 01:03:35.784
Let her fucking go, or I'll
blow your fucking head off!

1265
01:03:35.916 --> 01:03:37.217
He has Gaby and Evan.
They're alive. Fuck.

1266
01:03:37.351 --> 01:03:38.419
What do I do, Jess?
Where are they?

1267
01:03:38.553 --> 01:03:39.887
Please, Scuba, please.

1268
01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:41.288
Where are they?
Jess, what do I do?

1269
01:03:41.422 --> 01:03:42.590
I don't know! I don't know!

1270
01:03:42.823 --> 01:03:44.358
Listen, let her fucking go.

1271
01:03:44.491 --> 01:03:45.959
Shoot him. Shoot
him, please, please.

1272
01:03:46.093 --> 01:03:48.195
Let her fucking
go! Scuba! Scuba.

1273
01:03:48.329 --> 01:03:49.296
Stop! Shoot him!
Shoot him now!

1274
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:51.365
Scuba. Scuba, the safety.

1275
01:03:51.498 --> 01:03:53.067
- Take off the safety.
- Fuck!

1276
01:04:12.252 --> 01:04:14.154
What do I... what
do I do, Jess?

1277
01:04:15.557 --> 01:04:17.224
Jess, what do I do?

1278
01:04:21.362 --> 01:04:22.896
It doesn't seem real. I mean,

1279
01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:24.398
I-I can't even believe
this is really happening.

1280
01:04:24.532 --> 01:04:26.300
How does this happen
in a place like this?

1281
01:04:26.433 --> 01:04:27.802
I mean, is there any...

1282
01:04:27.935 --> 01:04:29.303
Like, what are they...
What do you do?

1283
01:04:29.436 --> 01:04:31.071
Somebody need to call SWAT?
I mean, have you ever?

1284
01:04:31.205 --> 01:04:32.439
I mean, maybe we should move.

1285
01:04:32.574 --> 01:04:34.341
I-I don't want to move.
I love this house.

1286
01:04:34.475 --> 01:04:36.310
We're not moving. It's not
even a possibility to move.

1287
01:04:36.443 --> 01:04:38.212
They're not gonna let
me... I-I just need...

1288
01:04:38.345 --> 01:04:40.047
I just need... Give me
a couple of seconds.

1289
01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:41.783
I just think we're
all in agreement

1290
01:04:41.915 --> 01:04:43.384
that we're not gonna be
participating in the parade.

1291
01:04:43.518 --> 01:04:45.319
I'm with you, Thomas.

1292
01:04:47.221 --> 01:04:49.423
Well, I know I'm not
going. It's too dangerous.

1293
01:04:49.557 --> 01:04:52.259
And it's not dangerous
for Gaby and Evan?

1294
01:04:54.895 --> 01:04:56.964
You saw what he did to Yulia.

1295
01:04:57.097 --> 01:04:59.133
I can't let that
happen to them.

1296
01:04:59.266 --> 01:05:00.635
We have to stop him.

1297
01:05:00.869 --> 01:05:02.804
This parade is our
chance to catch him.

1298
01:05:02.936 --> 01:05:04.972
If we hide, then what?

1299
01:05:05.105 --> 01:05:06.974
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life

1300
01:05:07.107 --> 01:05:08.610
looking over my
shoulder. Do you?

1301
01:05:10.444 --> 01:05:12.246
You're right, Jess.

1302
01:05:12.379 --> 01:05:15.015
- I'm in. Let's do this.
- Look.

1303
01:05:15.149 --> 01:05:16.684
Right Mart has extra security,

1304
01:05:16.917 --> 01:05:18.452
so we don't have to worry
about the store. Okay?

1305
01:05:18.586 --> 01:05:20.954
And as far as I'm concerned,
the parade has been decided.

1306
01:05:21.088 --> 01:05:24.158
God, I do not want to be
dragged into this any further.

1307
01:05:24.291 --> 01:05:25.727
I mean, if you hadn't even gone

1308
01:05:25.959 --> 01:05:27.394
into the store, this
would've never happened.

1309
01:05:27.529 --> 01:05:29.062
Enough, Kathleen.
Don't you mean you?

1310
01:05:29.196 --> 01:05:30.698
You're the one who
wanted to open the store.

1311
01:05:30.931 --> 01:05:32.901
Nobody was
"Nostra-fucking-damus"

1312
01:05:33.033 --> 01:05:34.836
to predict what
happened last year.

1313
01:05:34.968 --> 01:05:37.304
Besides, this year,
I'm closing the store.

1314
01:05:37.438 --> 01:05:39.273
Thanksgiving's a
holiday, even for us.

1315
01:05:39.406 --> 01:05:40.842
Wait, honey, what?

1316
01:05:40.974 --> 01:05:41.975
Kathleen, it's the
right thing to do.

1317
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:43.444
I made the decision.
It's final.

1318
01:05:45.345 --> 01:05:46.915
Sheriff, is there a
way to set a trap?

1319
01:05:47.047 --> 01:05:48.248
Well...

1320
01:05:48.382 --> 01:05:51.018
when the float returns
to the warehouse,

1321
01:05:51.151 --> 01:05:52.854
we can make it look
like it's empty.

1322
01:05:52.986 --> 01:05:55.355
Make him think there's
an opportunity to strike.

1323
01:05:55.489 --> 01:05:57.090
And if he takes the bait,

1324
01:05:57.224 --> 01:05:58.459
it'll be over right
there and then.

1325
01:05:58.593 --> 01:06:00.060
The bait?

1326
01:06:00.194 --> 01:06:02.362
Excuse me, I don't want
us being used as bait.

1327
01:06:02.496 --> 01:06:04.933
We don't finish it now, we'll
be bait no matter where we go.

1328
01:06:05.065 --> 01:06:06.200
My daughter's right.

1329
01:06:08.937 --> 01:06:12.105
Tomorrow, John Carver
is gonna go down.

1330
01:06:22.349 --> 01:06:24.218
All right, Lionel, turkey time.

1331
01:06:26.955 --> 01:06:28.723
Here we go.

1332
01:06:52.079 --> 01:06:54.214
I want two people up here
to keep an eye on that.

1333
01:06:54.348 --> 01:06:56.450
Over here as well. See
this whole section?

1334
01:06:56.584 --> 01:06:58.218
Keep an eye on that
for me, will you? Hey.

1335
01:06:58.352 --> 01:06:59.988
Hey. Okay, when
you get back here,

1336
01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:01.421
this place is gonna look empty,

1337
01:07:01.556 --> 01:07:03.123
but I'm gonna be here,
and this whole place

1338
01:07:03.257 --> 01:07:04.792
will be crawling
with officers, okay?

1339
01:07:05.058 --> 01:07:07.461
Yup. Thank you,
Sheriff. You're welcome.

1340
01:07:07.595 --> 01:07:09.229
Hi.

1341
01:07:09.363 --> 01:07:11.031
Thank you for coming. Mm.

1342
01:07:12.065 --> 01:07:13.200
You ready?

1343
01:07:13.333 --> 01:07:15.168
No. Good.

1344
01:07:15.302 --> 01:07:18.105
Me neither. Let's do this.

1345
01:07:18.238 --> 01:07:20.508
Okay.

1346
01:07:20.642 --> 01:07:21.776
Hey, Jess.

1347
01:07:23.143 --> 01:07:24.211
Uh...

1348
01:07:25.547 --> 01:07:26.548
What's this?

1349
01:07:26.681 --> 01:07:27.982
Oh, it's my dad's
ring from Iraq.

1350
01:07:28.115 --> 01:07:30.150
He said it kept him alive.

1351
01:07:30.284 --> 01:07:32.286
Uh, i-if you want,
wear it for good luck.

1352
01:07:33.487 --> 01:07:35.489
Thank you. You're welcome.

1353
01:07:48.703 --> 01:07:50.705
Happy Thanksgiving!

1354
01:07:59.212 --> 01:08:00.582
Hi.

1355
01:08:18.265 --> 01:08:19.634
Pilgrims!

1356
01:08:21.134 --> 01:08:23.270
Happy Thanksgiving!

1357
01:09:08.348 --> 01:09:10.484
Down with Right Mart!

1358
01:09:10.618 --> 01:09:12.920
Down with Right Mart!
Down with Right Mart!

1359
01:09:13.153 --> 01:09:14.488
What's going on?

1360
01:09:14.622 --> 01:09:16.691
Down with Right Mart!
Down with Right Mart!

1361
01:09:16.824 --> 01:09:18.191
What the hell is
going on down there?

1362
01:09:18.325 --> 01:09:19.393
It's Mitch.

1363
01:09:19.527 --> 01:09:22.195
Get off the parade
route. Get off!

1364
01:09:22.329 --> 01:09:23.497
Get off! Move along.

1365
01:09:23.631 --> 01:09:25.198
Come on, come on.
It's nothing. Okay.

1366
01:09:35.375 --> 01:09:37.145
Happy Thanksgiving.

1367
01:09:37.277 --> 01:09:40.748
You have a great day.
Happy Thanksgiving!

1368
01:09:45.586 --> 01:09:47.555
Happy Thanksgiv...

1369
01:10:00.267 --> 01:10:01.636
Grandpa, Grandpa, watch out!

1370
01:10:01.769 --> 01:10:02.970
Stop the truck!

1371
01:10:04.706 --> 01:10:06.373
Watch out!

1372
01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:13.948
- Come on.
- Go, go.

1373
01:10:14.214 --> 01:10:15.616
Go.

1374
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:18.653
Wake up! Grandpa! Wake up!
Grandpa, wake up! Wake up!

1375
01:10:18.786 --> 01:10:21.189
Grandpa, wake up!
Grandpa! Wake up! Wake up!

1376
01:10:22.724 --> 01:10:24.324
Come on, get in, get in,
get in, get in, get in!

1377
01:10:24.458 --> 01:10:25.827
Get in! Go, go, go, go, go!

1378
01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.995
In, in, in, in, in! Oh, shit.

1379
01:10:28.228 --> 01:10:29.429
Get us out of here.

1380
01:10:43.276 --> 01:10:44.444

No.

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:34.822
No! No.

1403
01:17:34.955 --> 01:17:36.957
No!

1404
01:17:42.963 --> 01:17:44.999
Help me. Please don't
kill me, please.

1405
01:17:45.132 --> 01:17:46.867
Please!

1406
01:17:47.001 --> 01:17:48.435
Open the door! Open the...

1407
01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:50.204
Please, please don't
do this. Please.

1408
01:17:50.337 --> 01:17:51.972
Please, I'm begging you, please!

1409
01:17:52.106 --> 01:17:53.407
No!

1410
01:17:57.845 --> 01:18:01.115
No. No! No! No! Please.

1411
01:18:01.248 --> 01:18:02.950
No!

1412
01:18:03.083 --> 01:18:05.152
No, please!

1413
01:18:05.286 --> 01:18:06.287
No!

1414
01:18:10.090 --> 01:18:11.660
No! Please!

1415
01:18:11.792 --> 01:18:13.894
No... No!

1416
01:18:15.996 --> 01:18:18.667
No! No!

1417
01:18:30.144 --> 01:18:32.813
I'm live outside the
Plymouth Sheriff's Department

1418
01:18:32.947 --> 01:18:36.183
where outraged citizens
are demanding answers

1419
01:18:36.317 --> 01:18:39.220
after a performer was
murdered in broad daylight

1420
01:18:39.353 --> 01:18:41.623
at the Thanksgiving Day Parade.

1421
01:18:41.755 --> 01:18:44.124
Flash grenades, smoke bombs.

1422
01:18:44.258 --> 01:18:45.726
I think he's ex-military.

1423
01:18:45.859 --> 01:18:47.127
Could be.

1424
01:18:47.261 --> 01:18:48.462
There's no way he's
in a civilian car.

1425
01:18:48.697 --> 01:18:49.930
Yeah.

1426
01:18:50.064 --> 01:18:51.298
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I-I got something.

1427
01:18:51.432 --> 01:18:52.399
What do you got?

1428
01:18:54.368 --> 01:18:57.137
He's live streaming from
somewhere in Cordage Park.

1429
01:19:00.374 --> 01:19:02.409
What the fuck is that?

1430
01:19:04.345 --> 01:19:05.980
Labelle, let's go.

1431
01:19:06.113 --> 01:19:08.983
I'll try to lock the
coordinates in. Calling SWAT.

1432
01:19:09.116 --> 01:19:11.752
I need SWAT and all units at
Cordage Park, immediately.

1433
01:19:24.031 --> 01:19:27.101
There's nothing here.
We're in a parking lot.

1434
01:19:27.234 --> 01:19:29.303
It's telling me you're
in the exact spot.

1435
01:19:29.436 --> 01:19:31.038
I'm telling you,
there's fuck all here.

1436
01:19:31.171 --> 01:19:32.206
I don't see nothing.

1437
01:19:32.339 --> 01:19:33.440
This way. Fuck!

1438
01:19:35.309 --> 01:19:37.478
Are there tunnels underneath us?

1439
01:19:48.422 --> 01:19:49.957
We'll each take an exit.

1440
01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:51.392
Labelle, you take Water
Street and Mayflower.

1441
01:19:51.526 --> 01:19:52.694
I'll take Green and Union.

1442
01:19:52.826 --> 01:19:54.028
You guys take Doten Street.

1443
01:19:54.161 --> 01:19:55.697
SWAT's gonna flush
him out. Got it?

1444
01:19:55.829 --> 01:19:56.997
Okay? Let's go.

1445
01:20:01.468 --> 01:20:03.170
You'll be okay.

1446
01:20:03.304 --> 01:20:04.905
It's gonna be okay.

1447
01:20:12.079 --> 01:20:14.749
Go, go, go! Take it down!

1448
01:20:14.882 --> 01:20:16.150
On three. Ready?

1449
01:20:16.283 --> 01:20:18.085
Two lines, two columns.

1450
01:20:18.218 --> 01:20:19.420
Copy.

1451
01:20:19.554 --> 01:20:20.789
Go, go. Cover my six.

1452
01:20:20.921 --> 01:20:21.889
Copy that.

1453
01:20:23.457 --> 01:20:25.893
Closing in on the signal.

1454
01:20:26.026 --> 01:20:28.295
Go, go, go!

1455
01:20:28.429 --> 01:20:31.165
Break it in. Copy.

1456
01:20:36.937 --> 01:20:38.072
Did you find them?

1457
01:20:38.205 --> 01:20:39.840
Give me a sitrep.

1458
01:20:39.973 --> 01:20:41.241
Did you find them?

1459
01:20:44.044 --> 01:20:45.312
What the fuck?

1460
01:20:50.585 --> 01:20:52.821
It's a fucking monitor.

1461
01:20:52.953 --> 01:20:54.455
Damn.

1462
01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:01.095
He's using a new cell.

1463
01:21:02.429 --> 01:21:04.298
Gather 'round.

1464
01:21:05.399 --> 01:21:06.900
No, no, no. No.

1465
01:21:07.034 --> 01:21:09.269
Gather 'round the
table, everyone.

1466
01:21:12.206 --> 01:21:14.609
Dinner is served.

1467
01:21:26.387 --> 01:21:28.255
Goddamn.

1468
01:21:28.389 --> 01:21:29.858
What the fuck is that?

1469
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:31.425
What the fuck?

1470
01:21:31.559 --> 01:21:33.193
Now, is that any way
to thank Kathleen?

1471
01:21:33.327 --> 01:21:36.296
She's been cooking all day.

1472
01:21:42.369 --> 01:21:46.407
Let's start off the
dinner with a cheer

1473
01:21:46.541 --> 01:21:49.878
from our cheerleader.

1474
01:21:57.951 --> 01:22:00.187
Fresh from my wine refrigerator.

1475
01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:02.956
She'll pair nicely
with Kathleen.

1476
01:22:03.090 --> 01:22:05.225
I'm scared. I'm scared.

1477
01:22:05.359 --> 01:22:08.495
You might want to
let that breathe.

1478
01:22:14.034 --> 01:22:18.005
So nice to all be together
again on Thanksgiving.

1479
01:22:18.138 --> 01:22:20.274
And joining us... Dad!

1480
01:22:20.407 --> 01:22:22.342
Our guest of honor,
Thomas Wright,

1481
01:22:22.476 --> 01:22:25.979
who missed last year's fun
sitting in his mansion.

1482
01:22:27.682 --> 01:22:30.050
Hmm.

1483
01:22:30.184 --> 01:22:32.386
Now...

1484
01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:35.122
we're all going to
go around the table

1485
01:22:35.255 --> 01:22:38.192
and say what we're thankful for.

1486
01:22:38.325 --> 01:22:40.994
You're on live, so
choose your words wisely.

1487
01:22:41.128 --> 01:22:43.096
Evan.

1488
01:22:43.230 --> 01:22:46.133
No, no, no, no, no. No, Ev.

1489
01:22:46.266 --> 01:22:49.503
Most appropriate
that you go first.

1490
01:22:49.637 --> 01:22:52.507
You see, it was your video

1491
01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:56.477
that inspired me to make my own.

1492
01:22:56.611 --> 01:22:57.978
Okay.

1493
01:23:00.113 --> 01:23:01.415
Evan!

1494
01:23:01.549 --> 01:23:02.584
No.

1495
01:23:02.717 --> 01:23:04.351
Help! Help!

1496
01:23:04.485 --> 01:23:06.353
We're-we're in an old
house! Let him go!

1497
01:23:06.487 --> 01:23:08.322
Let him go!

1498
01:23:08.455 --> 01:23:10.290
So get ready, Evan.
No, no, no, no.

1499
01:23:10.424 --> 01:23:12.226
You're about to go viral.
Please don't kill me...

1500
01:23:12.359 --> 01:23:14.995
You're going to
break the Internet.

1501
01:23:15.128 --> 01:23:17.331
Let him go! No!

1502
01:23:20.668 --> 01:23:23.136
No one appreciates
subtlety anymore.

1503
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:24.906
To go viral,

1504
01:23:25.038 --> 01:23:27.174
you really need to hit
people over the head.

1505
01:23:27.307 --> 01:23:28.375
Right, Evan?

1506
01:23:34.414 --> 01:23:35.984
Mm.

1507
01:23:36.116 --> 01:23:37.986
Look at all those likes.

1508
01:23:38.118 --> 01:23:39.453
Congratulations, Evan.

1509
01:23:39.587 --> 01:23:41.321
You're a star.

1510
01:23:44.659 --> 01:23:47.327
Now that I have
your attention...

1511
01:23:47.461 --> 01:23:51.198
you're probably wondering
why you're still alive

1512
01:23:51.331 --> 01:23:53.333
and they were all killed.

1513
01:23:53.467 --> 01:23:55.537
They were just greedy.

1514
01:23:55.670 --> 01:23:57.572
But you...

1515
01:23:57.705 --> 01:23:59.406
you're the VIPs.

1516
01:23:59.541 --> 01:24:02.242
It wasn't enough to
get in the store early.

1517
01:24:02.376 --> 01:24:04.411
You had to taunt
everyone outside

1518
01:24:04.546 --> 01:24:06.313
to show them how
special you were.

1519
01:24:06.446 --> 01:24:10.250
Well, once this
video goes viral,

1520
01:24:10.384 --> 01:24:12.252
everyone will know
how special you are.

1521
01:24:14.087 --> 01:24:16.591
Too bad you won't
be alive to see it.

1522
01:24:16.724 --> 01:24:20.028
This will be the most
famous Thanksgiving dinner

1523
01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:22.262
since 1621.

1524
01:24:23.798 --> 01:24:27.501
And every year, people
will watch this video...

1525
01:24:29.336 --> 01:24:30.404
and think of your greed

1526
01:24:30.538 --> 01:24:33.373
and the people who died from it.

1527
01:24:34.474 --> 01:24:36.544
Now, let's eat.

1528
01:24:38.111 --> 01:24:40.247
Thomas.

1529
01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:42.382
You love your consumers.

1530
01:24:46.119 --> 01:24:48.723
Well, tonight's your
night to be one.

1531
01:24:59.601 --> 01:25:02.402
Take a bite of your lovely wife

1532
01:25:02.537 --> 01:25:04.739
and show me how
thankful you are.

1533
01:25:10.778 --> 01:25:13.146
Show me that you're thankful...

1534
01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:14.481
or die.

1535
01:25:21.689 --> 01:25:22.857
Oh, fuck!

1536
01:25:24.324 --> 01:25:25.192
Go, go, go!

1537
01:25:25.325 --> 01:25:27.461
Run! Go!

1538
01:25:27.595 --> 01:25:29.229
Go, go, go! Run! Run!

1539
01:25:29.363 --> 01:25:30.565
This way!

1540
01:25:30.698 --> 01:25:32.399
Oh, fuck!

1541
01:25:32.533 --> 01:25:33.868
Watch out!

1542
01:25:34.102 --> 01:25:35.770
Scuba!

1543
01:25:37.705 --> 01:25:39.439
Scuba, this way, this way, go.

1544
01:25:41.609 --> 01:25:42.610
It's the Carver
House. The door, door.

1545
01:25:42.744 --> 01:25:43.911
Jess, go, go, go.

1546
01:26:48.843 --> 01:26:50.477
Sheriff?

1547
01:26:54.247 --> 01:26:55.850
Sheriff.

1548
01:27:43.363 --> 01:27:44.665
It's me.

1549
01:27:44.799 --> 01:27:45.867
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

1550
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.501
It's Bobby.

1551
01:27:47.635 --> 01:27:49.269
It's Bobby. It's Bobby.

1552
01:27:49.402 --> 01:27:50.671
He went that way. Okay,
get outside, get outside.

1553
01:27:50.805 --> 01:27:51.773
Get outside. Just get out.

1554
01:27:51.906 --> 01:27:52.874
Come on. He went that way.

1555
01:28:01.015 --> 01:28:03.718
No. No.

1556
01:28:06.888 --> 01:28:08.022
He's in there. No.

1557
01:28:08.256 --> 01:28:09.289
I think I shot him.

1558
01:28:09.422 --> 01:28:11.025
No. Then I lost him.

1559
01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:14.028
All clear here.

1560
01:28:14.262 --> 01:28:15.328
Check over there.

1561
01:28:24.906 --> 01:28:27.340
Oh, sir. Detective
Chu says you need

1562
01:28:27.474 --> 01:28:29.577
to turn in your service
weapon since it's been fired.

1563
01:28:29.710 --> 01:28:31.746
Right, right. Yeah,
of course. Sorry, pal.

1564
01:28:31.879 --> 01:28:33.681
No, don't worry about
it. I understand.

1565
01:28:42.924 --> 01:28:44.058
Sheriff,

1566
01:28:44.292 --> 01:28:46.393
we, uh, found this on the floor.

1567
01:28:46.527 --> 01:28:48.863
Still logged into the
John Carver account.

1568
01:28:48.996 --> 01:28:50.965
Thanks, Pete.

1569
01:28:52.033 --> 01:28:53.500
It's Bobby's.

1570
01:28:53.634 --> 01:28:55.402
We have every police officer

1571
01:28:55.536 --> 01:28:57.638
in a hundred-mile radius
searching for him.

1572
01:28:59.974 --> 01:29:02.777
They, uh...

1573
01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:05.478
They had to sedate your
father pretty heavily.

1574
01:29:05.613 --> 01:29:07.682
He'll be in the hospital a few
days, along with your friends

1575
01:29:07.815 --> 01:29:09.550
Gaby and Scuba.

1576
01:29:10.818 --> 01:29:13.654
I'm... sorry about
Kathleen and Evan.

1577
01:29:17.859 --> 01:29:19.560
Labelle.

1578
01:29:19.694 --> 01:29:20.962
Chu, see you at the hospital.

1579
01:29:21.095 --> 01:29:22.330
We'll be there in a minute.

1580
01:29:22.462 --> 01:29:24.699
See you there.

1581
01:29:24.832 --> 01:29:26.801
We'll see you there, Sheriff.

1582
01:29:32.039 --> 01:29:34.374
You're really brave, you know.

1583
01:29:36.476 --> 01:29:38.579
Thank you.

1584
01:29:38.713 --> 01:29:40.615
Couldn't have done
this without you.

1585
01:29:41.916 --> 01:29:43.651
Can you just give me a minute

1586
01:29:43.784 --> 01:29:45.786
to catch my breath, and
then... and then we can go?

1587
01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:47.722
Yeah, sure.

1588
01:29:47.855 --> 01:29:49.891
I'll be right back.

1589
01:30:19.486 --> 01:30:20.755
You ready?

1590
01:30:34.902 --> 01:30:37.805
It's about the details.

1591
01:30:37.939 --> 01:30:41.441
Small mistakes, that's
how they get caught.

1592
01:30:41.575 --> 01:30:43.577
I could really use
your help, Jessica.

1593
01:30:43.711 --> 01:30:47.048
Couldn't have done
this without you.

1594
01:30:47.181 --> 01:30:48.883
But you got to be
careful who you trust.

1595
01:30:51.619 --> 01:30:53.721
Jess, you okay?

1596
01:30:53.854 --> 01:30:55.723
S-Sorry.

1597
01:30:55.856 --> 01:30:58.359
Um...

1598
01:30:58.491 --> 01:31:00.795
I'm-I'm not feeling well.

1599
01:31:00.928 --> 01:31:02.863
We'll have a doctor
check you out.

1600
01:31:03.931 --> 01:31:05.465
Come on.

1601
01:31:20.181 --> 01:31:23.784
If only you'd be stuck on
the fence a second longer.

1602
01:31:37.898 --> 01:31:40.401
It's like fumbling
on the one-yard line.

1603
01:31:42.536 --> 01:31:44.839
It's almost funny if you
really think about it.

1604
01:31:50.544 --> 01:31:52.480
You should see the look
of surprise on your face.

1605
01:31:53.948 --> 01:31:55.516
What about Bobby?

1606
01:31:55.649 --> 01:31:56.751
Bobby?

1607
01:31:56.884 --> 01:31:59.487
I had him drugged, dressed up,

1608
01:31:59.620 --> 01:32:01.489
ready to be shot,

1609
01:32:01.622 --> 01:32:04.959
putting an end to the mystery
of John Carver's identity.

1610
01:32:05.092 --> 01:32:08.562
But when I opened the trunk,
he popped me with a tire iron.

1611
01:32:08.696 --> 01:32:10.598
Thankfully,

1612
01:32:10.731 --> 01:32:12.633
you pointed me in the
right direction...

1613
01:32:12.767 --> 01:32:14.468
again.

1614
01:32:14.602 --> 01:32:17.638
You've been using
me... this whole time?

1615
01:32:17.772 --> 01:32:21.442
When I said, I couldn't
do this without your help,

1616
01:32:21.575 --> 01:32:24.011
I really meant it.

1617
01:32:25.112 --> 01:32:27.581
Why?

1618
01:32:27.715 --> 01:32:31.318
Why... are you doing this?

1619
01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:34.955
Mm.

1620
01:32:35.089 --> 01:32:39.326
Mitch wasn't the only one
who lost someone that night.

1621
01:32:42.096 --> 01:32:45.466
My wife left me, and Amanda
put me back together.

1622
01:32:45.599 --> 01:32:46.934
I loved her.

1623
01:32:47.068 --> 01:32:49.703
She was gonna leave Mitch.

1624
01:32:49.837 --> 01:32:52.073
But then, you and your
friends took her from me.

1625
01:32:56.977 --> 01:32:59.146
You took my family from me.

1626
01:33:03.050 --> 01:33:05.619
So now, instead of spending
Thanksgiving with Amanda,

1627
01:33:05.753 --> 01:33:07.755
I am stuck here in this office.

1628
01:33:07.888 --> 01:33:10.858
And now, so are you.

1629
01:33:10.991 --> 01:33:13.094
I'd love to keep chatting,

1630
01:33:13.227 --> 01:33:15.162
but now, I got to take
care of some loose ends.

1631
01:33:15.296 --> 01:33:16.565
Wait.

1632
01:33:16.697 --> 01:33:18.132
I-I didn't get to tell you

1633
01:33:18.265 --> 01:33:20.301
what I was thankful for.

1634
01:33:22.603 --> 01:33:24.171
What are you thankful for?

1635
01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:27.708
The service in here.

1636
01:33:39.753 --> 01:33:42.389
You should see the look
of surprise on your face.

1637
01:33:42.623 --> 01:33:44.391
You fucking bitch.

1638
01:33:54.603 --> 01:33:56.971
Jess.

1639
01:33:57.104 --> 01:33:58.906
Hey. Come on. Bobby?

1640
01:33:59.039 --> 01:34:00.774
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1641
01:34:03.043 --> 01:34:05.312
Hey, come on, come
on. Oh, wait. Wait.

1642
01:34:06.615 --> 01:34:08.415
Aw, fuck.

1643
01:34:09.917 --> 01:34:11.652
Look. Your uncle's truck.

1644
01:34:11.785 --> 01:34:12.887
- Jessica?!
- Shh.

1645
01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:15.222
Shh. Get down.

1646
01:34:22.396 --> 01:34:25.132
Sorry, Jessica.

1647
01:34:25.266 --> 01:34:27.735
This year, there will be...

1648
01:34:27.868 --> 01:34:30.938
no... leftovers!

1649
01:34:42.383 --> 01:34:45.419
When I told your stepmother,

1650
01:34:45.654 --> 01:34:48.789
she would make an
excellent dinner...

1651
01:34:50.691 --> 01:34:52.627
that... was not...

1652
01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:55.896
a lie!

1653
01:35:03.137 --> 01:35:04.838
Go.

1654
01:35:07.208 --> 01:35:09.176
This way. Come on. Come on.

1655
01:35:42.743 --> 01:35:44.278
Oh.

1656
01:35:53.887 --> 01:35:57.224
Bobby?!

1657
01:35:59.026 --> 01:36:00.094
Bobby!

1658
01:36:01.295 --> 01:36:02.963
No!

1659
01:36:15.075 --> 01:36:18.879
Bobby, go! Come on,
come on, come on.

1660
01:36:19.013 --> 01:36:20.147
It's the... it's the cable.

1661
01:36:20.281 --> 01:36:22.883
I'm trying to drive.
It's not moving.

1662
01:36:58.052 --> 01:37:00.354
Hey, Sheriff, you were right!

1663
01:37:00.487 --> 01:37:02.122
No... leftovers!

1664
01:37:02.256 --> 01:37:05.859
Jessica!

1665
01:37:16.937 --> 01:37:19.340
Roger on unit 121.

1666
01:37:23.077 --> 01:37:24.945
Come here.

1667
01:37:25.079 --> 01:37:26.748
Take care of yourself.

1668
01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:28.082
I'll call you from school.

1669
01:37:28.215 --> 01:37:30.117
Be safe. Yeah.

1670
01:37:30.250 --> 01:37:33.555
Tell Ryan he's still a dick,
even if he's not the killer.

1671
01:37:37.458 --> 01:37:39.927
Oh, Jess.

1672
01:37:42.896 --> 01:37:44.365
Hey.

1673
01:37:44.498 --> 01:37:46.467
I thought you guys
were at the hospital.

1674
01:37:46.601 --> 01:37:48.803
We technically still are.

1675
01:37:48.936 --> 01:37:50.805
We saw the stream.

1676
01:37:50.938 --> 01:37:54.041
Detective. We searched
every inch of that place.

1677
01:37:54.174 --> 01:37:55.844
Everything was incinerated.

1678
01:37:55.976 --> 01:37:58.045
There's nothing but ash.

1679
01:37:58.178 --> 01:38:01.115
No one could survive
a blast like that.

1680
01:38:40.387 --> 01:38:41.955
You okay?

1681
01:38:45.092 --> 01:38:46.226
