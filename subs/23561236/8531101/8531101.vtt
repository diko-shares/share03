Yes, Brittany, kick it off.

00:01:02.272 --> 00:01:04.775
I don't have a thought
on the reading,

7
00:01:04.858 --> 00:01:07.778
I just think that that
word on the board is wrong.

8

Well, I think it still has
two G's in it last I checked.

[Brittany] It's not funny.

We shouldn't have to stare
at the N-word all day.

12

Uh, listen,

13
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.125
this is a class
on the literature

14
00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:23.502
of the American south.

15
00:01:23.585 --> 00:01:24.753
You're going to encounter

16
00:01:24.837 --> 00:01:27.506
some archaic thoughts,
coarse language,

17
00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:29.299
but we're all adults here

18
00:01:29.383 --> 00:01:31.635
and I think we can understand it

19
00:01:31.718 --> 00:01:33.846
within the context in
which it's written.

20
00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.974
Well, I just find that
word really offensive.

21
00:01:37.057 --> 00:01:39.476
With all due respect, Brittany,

22
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.729
I got over it, I'm
pretty sure you can too.

23
00:01:42.813 --> 00:01:43.813
Well, I don't see why.

When did they all become
so goddamn delicate?

31
00:02:02.082 --> 00:02:03.792
This wasn't an

33
00:02:05.127 --> 00:02:06.521
[woman] Last month
you asked a student

34
00:02:06.545 --> 00:02:08.463
if his family had been Nazis.

35
00:02:08.547 --> 00:02:10.048
Yeah, I did, he's German,

36
00:02:10.132 --> 00:02:11.651
we were reading <i>The
Plot Against America</i>

37
00:02:11.675 --> 00:02:14.177
and trust me, by the way he
was squirming, they were.

38
00:02:14.261 --> 00:02:15.470
Oh, my God.

39
00:02:15.554 --> 00:02:18.348
Um, Monk, you are a
very talented writer,

40
00:02:18.432 --> 00:02:20.350
we're fortunate
to have you here.

41

What? He hasn't
published in years.

42
00:02:22.978 --> 00:02:24.521
I have written three novels

43
00:02:24.605 --> 00:02:26.106
since the last
time you published.

44
00:02:26.315 --> 00:02:28.042
Yeah, this is true, and the
speed with which you write

45
00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:29.693
only proves that good
things take time.

46

Yeah, relax, Mandy.

49
00:02:35.532 --> 00:02:37.618

very excited about it.

50

Oh, that's great to hear.

51

- Can we stop stalling, Leo?

00:02:44.875 --> 00:02:46.043
Listen, Monk,

54
00:02:48.295 --> 00:02:49.755
we'd like to give you a break.

55
00:02:53.675 --> 00:02:54.718
What do you mean, break?

56
00:02:54.801 --> 00:02:56.011
Just some time off.

57
00:02:56.094 --> 00:02:57.846

It's just, you're already going
to Boston for the festival, right?

59

Why don't you just
stay there for...

60
00:03:02.225 --> 00:03:04.102
Because I hate Boston,
my family's there.

61
00:03:04.186 --> 00:03:05.771
Well, you need
some time to relax.

62
00:03:05.854 --> 00:03:07.314
You're on edge, man.

63
00:03:07.397 --> 00:03:08.917
You're under the
impression that time spent

64
00:03:08.941 --> 00:03:11.193
with my family will
take the edge off.

65
00:03:11.276 --> 00:03:12.861
- I'm fine.
- [Mandy] You're not fine.

66
00:03:12.945 --> 00:03:14.821

You know, if you spent
less time spying on me,

70
00:03:22.287 --> 00:03:23.287
you could

71
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.332

before you were an author?

151

Well, I did undergrad at Oberlin

152
00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:11.141
and moved to New York
the day after graduation

153
00:07:11.224 --> 00:07:12.976
and a couple months later,

154
00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:15.061
I was an assistant
at a publisher.

00:07:15.145 --> 00:07:17.689
[moderator] And did that assistant
experience shape your writing?

156
00:07:17.772 --> 00:07:21.776
Absolutely. Yeah, I was
a first reader meaning

157
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.696
I would read all the
manuscripts in the slush pile

158
00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:27.782
and send them up the ladder
if they were any good.

couldn't shake was that

162
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:38.710
no matter how good
the books were,

163
00:07:38.793 --> 00:07:43.340
most every submission was from
some white dude from New York

164
00:07:43.423 --> 00:07:44.466
going through a divorce,

165
00:07:44.549 --> 00:07:47.552
and too few of them
were about my people.

166
00:07:48.678 --> 00:07:49.679

167
00:07:50.513 --> 00:07:51.681
"Where are our stories?"

our representation?"

00:08:21.878 --> 00:08:23.421
'Ain't none ya business,

178
00:08:23.505 --> 00:08:26.675
but if'n you gots to know,
I's goin' to the pharmacy.'

179
00:08:28.051 --> 00:08:30.553
I looks back at the door
to see if Mama comin' out.

180
00:08:31.805 --> 00:08:35.183
'The pharmacy?
What for?' she aks.

181
00:08:36.351 --> 00:08:38.061
'You know', I says.

182
00:08:39.229 --> 00:08:40.939
'Nah', she say.

183
00:08:42.315 --> 00:08:45.568
'Hell, nah! Girl, you
be pregnant again?'

184
00:08:47.028 --> 00:08:48.822
'Might's be', I tells her.

185
00:08:49.781 --> 00:08:51.574
'And if I is,

186
00:08:51.658 --> 00:08:54.744
"Ray-Ray's gonna be a real
father this time around.'"

187
00:08:55.662 --> 00:08:57.289
[audience applauding, cheering]

188
00:08:58.081 --> 00:08:59.165
Thank you.

189
00:09:01.001 --> 00:09:03.420
[applauding, cheering continues]

190
00:09:03.503 --> 00:09:04.629
Yes!

191
00:09:32.532 --> 00:09:34.451
[alarm blaring]

192
00:09:39.664 --> 00:09:41.416
[metal detector beeping]

193
00:09:46.713 --> 00:09:48.065
- [Monk] Hi...
- [receptionist] Hi.

194
00:09:48.089 --> 00:09:49.632
I'm here to see Lisa Ellison.

195
00:09:49.716 --> 00:09:50.818
Uh, do you have an appointment?

196
00:09:50.842 --> 00:09:51.885
We're about to close.

197
00:09:51.968 --> 00:09:53.511
No, I'm her brother.

198
00:09:53.595 --> 00:09:54.697
- [door opens]
- [receptionist] Oh.

199
00:09:54.721 --> 00:09:55.721
There she is.

200
00:10:00.685 --> 00:10:01.770
Hello, Monk.

201
00:10:04.689 --> 00:10:05.690
Hi, Lisa.

202
00:10:14.491 --> 00:10:17.118
Okay, you're in a boat,
the motor cuts out,

203
00:10:18.078 --> 00:10:19.788
but you're in shallow water,

204
00:10:19.871 --> 00:10:22.374
but you're wearing
$600 shoes, but

205
00:10:23.875 --> 00:10:25.710
your ride to the airport

206
00:10:25.794 --> 00:10:27.754
is just pulling
away from the beach,

207
00:10:27.837 --> 00:10:31.424
why, oh, why is
this a legal issue?

208
00:10:34.386 --> 00:10:35.387
I don't know.

209
00:10:37.222 --> 00:10:38.681
It's a matter of
row versus wade.

210
00:10:38.765 --> 00:10:39.933
Oh, my God.

211
00:10:40.016 --> 00:10:41.017
[laughing]

212
00:10:41.976 --> 00:10:43.728
I think that's one of my best.

213
00:10:43.812 --> 00:10:44.813
Wow.

214
00:10:44.896 --> 00:10:45.897
[laughing]

215
00:10:46.856 --> 00:10:47.857
Okay.

216
00:10:51.653 --> 00:10:53.696
- When did you start smoking again?
- [Lisa] Mm...

217
00:10:55.657 --> 00:10:56.991
Right after the divorce.

218
00:10:58.743 --> 00:11:00.286
I always hated Larry.

219
00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:01.621
Oh, I know.

220
00:11:01.704 --> 00:11:03.015
You told me right when
we started dating.

221
00:11:03.039 --> 00:11:04.416
Do you remember how mad I got?

222
00:11:04.624 --> 00:11:06.352
[imitates Lisa] "It's not
your business who I fuck!

223
00:11:06.376 --> 00:11:07.419
Who I fellate."

224
00:11:07.502 --> 00:11:09.879
[laughs] I definitely
did not say "fellate."

225
00:11:09.963 --> 00:11:12.173
I thought you did. That's
how I heard it anyway.

226
00:11:13.758 --> 00:11:14.884
It's good to see you.

227
00:11:16.845 --> 00:11:18.430
Yeah, it's good to see you too.

228
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.143
How's work?

229
00:11:23.977 --> 00:11:25.311
It's not very glamorous.

230
00:11:26.771 --> 00:11:29.315
I go through a metal
detector every day.

231
00:11:30.984 --> 00:11:32.694
Well, what you do is important.

232
00:11:32.777 --> 00:11:33.778
Well...

233
00:11:34.946 --> 00:11:36.781
Meanwhile, all I do is

234
00:11:36.865 --> 00:11:38.533
invent little people in my head,

235
00:11:38.616 --> 00:11:41.327
then make them have imaginary
conversations with each other.

236
00:11:41.411 --> 00:11:44.205
Books change people's lives.

237
00:11:44.289 --> 00:11:46.624
Did something I've written
ever change your life?

238
00:11:46.708 --> 00:11:48.126
Absolutely.

239
00:11:48.877 --> 00:11:49.878
Absolutely.

240
00:11:51.671 --> 00:11:53.923
My dining room table
was wobbly as hell

241
00:11:54.007 --> 00:11:55.341
before your last book came out.

242
00:11:55.425 --> 00:11:57.153
- Oh, my God. All right.
- It was, like, perfect.

243
00:11:57.177 --> 00:11:58.487
- Yeah. Oh, God.
- I'm telling you and...

244
00:11:58.511 --> 00:12:00.054
Take me back to Logan, please.

245
00:12:00.138 --> 00:12:01.490
- Logan cannot help you, Monk.
- [sighs]

246
00:12:01.514 --> 00:12:03.391
- Oh, my God!
- [laughing]

247
00:12:04.309 --> 00:12:05.685
[Lisa] Welcome home, baby!

248
00:12:05.768 --> 00:12:07.312
[Lisa and Monk laughing]

249
00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.151
Hello!

250
00:12:14.027 --> 00:12:15.278
Hello!

251
00:12:15.361 --> 00:12:17.280
- [Lorraine shrieks, claps]
- [Monk chuckles]

252
00:12:19.657 --> 00:12:22.535
- Mr. Monk!
- [Monk] Lorraine!

253
00:12:23.203 --> 00:12:25.622
Oh.

254
00:12:25.705 --> 00:12:27.832
You know how that makes
me feel. It's just Monk.

255
00:12:27.916 --> 00:12:29.292
Oh, don't do that to me,

256
00:12:29.375 --> 00:12:32.003
you know I'm too old
to learn new names.

257
00:12:32.086 --> 00:12:34.088
- How you doing, Miss Lisa?
- I'm good.

258
00:12:34.172 --> 00:12:37.008
- You look good, Mr. Monk.
- Oh, I look fat.

259
00:12:37.091 --> 00:12:39.427
Oh, that's the
California talking.

260
00:12:39.511 --> 00:12:40.970
I took you to
Arkansas right now,

261
00:12:41.054 --> 00:12:42.472
- you'd be a beauty queen.
- Ooh!

262
00:12:42.555 --> 00:12:44.515
- [Agnes] Is that my Monkie?
- That's frightening.

263
00:12:44.557 --> 00:12:45.558
[Lisa laughing]

264
00:12:46.309 --> 00:12:48.102
[Agnes chuckling]

265
00:12:49.854 --> 00:12:52.899
- [Monk] Hi, Mother.
- [Agnes chuckles] Oh.

266
00:12:53.983 --> 00:12:56.444
- You look fat.
- Ah, I know.

267
00:12:56.528 --> 00:12:58.172
[Lorraine] You ready to go
to dinner, Mrs. Ellison?

268
00:12:58.196 --> 00:13:00.323
Uh, I just need my purse
and my black cardigan.

269
00:13:00.406 --> 00:13:01.550
[Lorraine] All
right, I'll get it.

270
00:13:01.574 --> 00:13:03.159
- Are you all right?
- Oh.

271
00:13:03.243 --> 00:13:04.953
You overeat when
you're depressed.

272
00:13:05.036 --> 00:13:06.704
I'm not depressed,

273
00:13:06.788 --> 00:13:09.499
I've just been not
sleeping well lately

274
00:13:09.582 --> 00:13:11.251
and so, fell off my
exercise routine.

275
00:13:11.334 --> 00:13:12.418
- [Agnes] Mm.
- Here.

276
00:13:12.502 --> 00:13:14.045
[Agnes] So you're not depressed.

277
00:13:14.128 --> 00:13:17.173
You just wear all the
hallmarks of depression.

278
00:13:17.257 --> 00:13:18.258
[Monk groans]

279
00:13:19.217 --> 00:13:20.301
I missed you.

280
00:13:21.219 --> 00:13:22.220
[Monk chuckles lightly]

281
00:13:22.971 --> 00:13:23.972
Is Larry coming?

282
00:13:25.598 --> 00:13:27.058
No, Mother.

283
00:13:28.226 --> 00:13:30.812
Larry and I are
separated, remember?

284
00:13:30.895 --> 00:13:33.439
- Of course, I remember.
- Okay.

285
00:13:33.523 --> 00:13:35.984
I just thought he might join us.

286
00:13:37.235 --> 00:13:38.361
To see your brother.

287
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.071
Okay.

288
00:13:43.199 --> 00:13:44.826
I mean, is it really
such a big deal?

289
00:13:44.909 --> 00:13:46.119
Everyone forgets things.

290
00:13:46.202 --> 00:13:47.704
Doesn't mean she's
sick necessarily.

291
00:13:47.787 --> 00:13:49.289
People forget
dentists' appointments.

292
00:13:51.332 --> 00:13:53.001
She forgets I'm not
married anymore.

293
00:13:53.876 --> 00:13:54.961
That's weird.

294
00:13:57.255 --> 00:13:58.756
What do you suggest we do?

295
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.049
Why do I have to decide?

296
00:14:00.258 --> 00:14:02.510
- Because you're a doctor.
- [Lisa] So are you.

297
00:14:02.594 --> 00:14:03.803
I'm not that kind.

298
00:14:03.886 --> 00:14:07.181
Okay, my point is, you
are an intelligent adult.

299
00:14:08.433 --> 00:14:09.976
And I'm tired of
being the only person

300
00:14:10.059 --> 00:14:11.102
that takes care of her.

301
00:14:11.185 --> 00:14:12.312
Well, I don't recall anyone

302
00:14:12.395 --> 00:14:13.938
assigning you that
responsibility.

303
00:14:14.022 --> 00:14:16.190
No, you and Cliff just fled
west as soon as you could

304
00:14:16.274 --> 00:14:18.109
and left me as
caretaker by default.

305
00:14:18.192 --> 00:14:19.611
My work's there.

306
00:14:19.819 --> 00:14:21.130
- "My work's there." Yeah.
- Apologies that it prevents me

307
00:14:21.154 --> 00:14:24.115
from keeping up with
the family melodrama.

308
00:14:24.198 --> 00:14:26.552
If you lived up the block, you
wouldn't know what was going on.

309
00:14:26.576 --> 00:14:29.120
I'm stuck here taking care
of that old house and finding

310
00:14:29.203 --> 00:14:31.164
love letters from Dad's affairs.

311
00:14:31.247 --> 00:14:33.291
- His what?
- [Lisa] His affairs.

312
00:14:33.374 --> 00:14:35.043
You didn't know he
was having affairs?

313
00:14:35.126 --> 00:14:37.545
No. How did you?

314
00:14:37.629 --> 00:14:39.756
Well, he was an OBGYN

315
00:14:39.839 --> 00:14:41.299
that was traveling constantly,

316
00:14:41.382 --> 00:14:43.343
but his patients were in Boston.

317
00:14:43.426 --> 00:14:44.844
He said he was going
to conferences.

318
00:14:44.927 --> 00:14:47.889
[scoffs] He was
making house calls.

319
00:14:47.972 --> 00:14:50.099
Do you know that I saw
him kiss a white woman

320
00:14:50.183 --> 00:14:51.809
in the park in high school?

321
00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.478
How white?

322
00:14:53.561 --> 00:14:54.771
What do you mean, "How white?"

323
00:14:54.854 --> 00:14:56.898
Like Brahmin white
or Southie white.

324
00:14:56.981 --> 00:14:59.776
I don't know. She had thin lips.

325
00:14:59.859 --> 00:15:01.194
She looked like a bad kisser.

326
00:15:02.737 --> 00:15:03.780
Did you tell Mother?

327
00:15:03.863 --> 00:15:06.574
No. I wasn't going
to blow up our lives.

328
00:15:06.658 --> 00:15:08.378
[clears throat] She's
coming back. Mom. Mom.

329
00:15:08.409 --> 00:15:09.409
Mom. Mom.

330
00:15:09.452 --> 00:15:10.453
Hi.

331
00:15:13.247 --> 00:15:14.248
How you doing?

332
00:15:15.291 --> 00:15:17.210
Our waitress isn't
wearing a bra.

333
00:15:17.877 --> 00:15:18.878
Okay.

334
00:15:19.462 --> 00:15:20.462
I didn't notice.

335
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.051
<i>See this shit?</i>

336
00:15:25.134 --> 00:15:26.803
<i>This gonna take us
out of the ghetto.</i>

337
00:15:26.886 --> 00:15:28.388
<i>But there are
rules in the house.</i>

338
00:15:28.471 --> 00:15:31.140
<i>Number one, never leave
this product in the house.</i>

339
00:15:31.224 --> 00:15:33.267
<i>And number two,
get your own crew.</i>

340
00:15:33.351 --> 00:15:35.520
<i>Number three, got to have
discipline in your crew.</i>

341
00:15:35.603 --> 00:15:38.106
<i>Number four, don't
praise a nigga too much.</i>

342
00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:39.774
<i>Otherwise he's gonna
think you're soft.</i>

343
00:15:39.857 --> 00:15:42.902
<i>Rule number five,
don't show no love.</i>

344
00:15:42.985 --> 00:15:44.696
<i>- Love will get you killed.</i>
- [chuckles]

345
00:15:44.779 --> 00:15:47.198
<i>See this, it's like a bitch.</i>

346
00:15:47.281 --> 00:15:50.159
<i>You fuck a bitch, don't
let a bitch fuck you.</i>

347
00:15:50.243 --> 00:15:52.120
<i>You're a man who
don't need nothing.</i>

348
00:15:52.203 --> 00:15:53.538
<i>No one will get you through.</i>

349
00:15:53.621 --> 00:15:56.040
<i>This bitch? This bitch
will take your soul.</i>

350
00:15:57.208 --> 00:15:58.543
<i>You niggas ain't got no fam...</i>

351
00:15:58.626 --> 00:15:59.669
[movie turns off]

352
00:16:02.296 --> 00:16:04.215
[Monk mutters]

353
00:16:05.925 --> 00:16:08.511
Excuse me, uh, Ned.

354
00:16:08.594 --> 00:16:10.930
Do you have any books by the
writer Thelonious Ellison?

355
00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:16.436
Yeah, this way.

356
00:16:20.773 --> 00:16:22.734
- Here you go.
- Right.

357
00:16:22.817 --> 00:16:24.277
Yeah.

358
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.362
Wait a minute, why
are these books here?

359
00:16:26.904 --> 00:16:28.114
[Ned] I'm not sure.

360
00:16:28.197 --> 00:16:32.535
I would imagine that this
author Ellison is... Black.

361
00:16:32.618 --> 00:16:35.246
That's me. Ellison. Yeah.

362
00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:39.625
He is me, and he
and I are Black.

363
00:16:39.709 --> 00:16:41.002
Oh, bingo.

364
00:16:41.085 --> 00:16:43.212
No bingo, Ned, these books

365
00:16:43.296 --> 00:16:45.715
have nothing to do with
African-American studies,

366
00:16:45.798 --> 00:16:47.091
they're just literature.

367
00:16:47.175 --> 00:16:49.051
The blackest thing about
this one is the ink.

368
00:16:51.304 --> 00:16:53.765
I don't decide what
sections the books go in.

369
00:16:53.848 --> 00:16:56.642
No one here does. That's
how chain stores work.

370
00:16:57.435 --> 00:16:58.936
Right, Ned.

371
00:17:00.021 --> 00:17:01.689
You don't make the rules.

372
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.150
Hm.

373
00:17:04.233 --> 00:17:06.611
I'm just going to put
them back after you leave.

374
00:17:06.694 --> 00:17:08.362
Don't you dare, Ned.

375
00:17:08.446 --> 00:17:10.782
Do not you dare.

376
00:17:12.867 --> 00:17:14.035
Ned.

377
00:17:15.036 --> 00:17:16.537
[suspenseful music playing]

378
00:17:16.621 --> 00:17:19.081
[lively music playing]

379
00:17:22.043 --> 00:17:23.503
Monk, what are you doing?

380
00:17:24.462 --> 00:17:25.630
[books thud]

381
00:17:27.507 --> 00:17:28.947
[Lisa] Mom's only
going to get worse.

382
00:17:31.052 --> 00:17:32.332
They say mental
exercise is good,

383
00:17:32.386 --> 00:17:33.986
that's why I got her
that gardening book.

384
00:17:35.139 --> 00:17:37.308
Does growing cucumbers
count as mental exercise?

385
00:17:38.059 --> 00:17:39.310
I hate when you do that.

386
00:17:39.393 --> 00:17:41.437
What?

387
00:17:41.521 --> 00:17:43.689
You share your condescending
opinion as a question

388
00:17:43.773 --> 00:17:45.525
trying to disguise
the condescension.

389
00:17:45.608 --> 00:17:46.859
Why don't you just say

390
00:17:46.943 --> 00:17:48.253
that you think that
gardening is idiotic?

391
00:17:48.277 --> 00:17:50.357
- Uh, because that's not what I was doing.
- Bullshit.

392
00:17:50.696 --> 00:17:51.989
Bullshit. Bullshit.

393
00:17:54.575 --> 00:17:57.161
Maybe we can hire a
nurse a few times a week.

394
00:17:57.245 --> 00:17:58.263
Who's going to pay for that?

395
00:17:58.287 --> 00:17:59.872
You... you can't afford it?

396
00:18:00.706 --> 00:18:02.458
Not after the divorce, I cannot.

397
00:18:04.418 --> 00:18:05.753
- [sighs]
- Well, it will hurt,

398
00:18:05.837 --> 00:18:07.922
but we'll probably have
to sell the beach house.

399
00:18:08.005 --> 00:18:10.591
Yeah, we definitely need
to sell the beach house,

400
00:18:10.675 --> 00:18:11.968
but that money is going to go

401
00:18:12.051 --> 00:18:13.886
to pay back the reverse mortgage

402
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:16.055
that our mother took
out on the other house.

403
00:18:17.932 --> 00:18:18.933
Yeah.

404
00:18:22.103 --> 00:18:23.288
Look, I can send
some money home,

405
00:18:23.312 --> 00:18:24.456
but it's not going to be much.

406
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.731
Can't Cliff chip in?

407
00:18:25.815 --> 00:18:27.275
Cliff's not in a
good place, okay?

408
00:18:27.358 --> 00:18:28.943
Who is? Okay?

409
00:18:29.026 --> 00:18:31.487
Monk, Becca took everything.

410
00:18:31.571 --> 00:18:34.282
And the kids are getting
teased at school.

411
00:18:34.365 --> 00:18:35.645
- I didn't know.
- [Lisa] Well...

412
00:18:36.325 --> 00:18:37.535
Maybe you should call him.

413
00:18:43.291 --> 00:18:45.293
I'm sorry I've always
been so distant.

414
00:18:45.376 --> 00:18:47.336
[upbeat music playing
faintly over speakers]

415
00:18:50.506 --> 00:18:52.758
You couldn't help that.

416
00:18:52.842 --> 00:18:54.427
You were always Dad's favorite.

417
00:18:56.846 --> 00:18:58.306
And that made Cliff and I bond,

418
00:18:58.389 --> 00:18:59.515
and you resented us

419
00:18:59.599 --> 00:19:01.851
for having that
bond, and then...

420
00:19:01.934 --> 00:19:03.769
{\an8}I don't know, you just
became self-sufficient.

421
00:19:06.856 --> 00:19:07.916
You never talked about this.

422
00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.525
We never talked about anything.

423
00:19:11.736 --> 00:19:13.195
Is that surprising?

424
00:19:13.279 --> 00:19:14.739
Look at our parents. [Scoffs]

425
00:19:15.448 --> 00:19:16.782
[Monk] Mm-hm.

426
00:19:16.866 --> 00:19:19.911
The only emotions
I remember from Dad

427
00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.707
were boredom and rage.

428
00:19:25.374 --> 00:19:26.709
Is boredom an emotion?

429
00:19:26.792 --> 00:19:27.877
[Lisa chuckles]

430
00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.004
Great. It's
Detective Dictionary.

431
00:19:30.087 --> 00:19:32.381
- [both laugh]
- [Lisa] Oh!

432
00:19:32.465 --> 00:19:33.942
You haven't called
me that in forever.

433
00:19:33.966 --> 00:19:35.343
Oh, God!

434
00:19:36.344 --> 00:19:38.429
- What? Oh, come on!
- [Lisa] Oh, God!

435
00:19:39.221 --> 00:19:40.264
[Lisa groans]

436
00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.601
- Lisa? You okay? Hey.
- [groans]

437
00:19:44.477 --> 00:19:45.478
[Lisa groans]

438
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.189
- Hey, help! Help!
- [Lisa groaning]

439
00:19:48.272 --> 00:19:50.024
[doctors and nurses
speaking indistinctly]

440
00:19:51.525 --> 00:19:53.277
[somber music playing]

441
00:20:33.609 --> 00:20:35.820
- [soft music playing]
- [bird chirping]

442
00:20:42.952 --> 00:20:45.579
[waves lapping]

443
00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.457
[Monk] "If you are reading this"

444
00:20:48.541 --> 00:20:51.794
it's because I,
Lisa Magical Ellison

445
00:20:53.337 --> 00:20:54.380
have died.

446
00:20:57.466 --> 00:20:59.343
Obviously, this is not ideal,

447
00:21:00.636 --> 00:21:02.888
but I guess it had to
happen at some point.

448
00:21:04.974 --> 00:21:06.350
Hopefully, I...

449
00:21:09.145 --> 00:21:11.814
Hopefully, I expired

450
00:21:11.897 --> 00:21:16.360
under the heaving thrusts
of a sweaty Idris Elba

451
00:21:16.444 --> 00:21:19.155
or perhaps in a less
dignified manner,

452
00:21:19.238 --> 00:21:22.950
"under the heaving thrusts
of a sweaty Russell Crowe."

453
00:21:23.034 --> 00:21:24.035
[chuckles]

454
00:21:24.118 --> 00:21:26.245
"Irrespective of how I went,

455
00:21:26.328 --> 00:21:29.040
I ask that those closest to me

456
00:21:30.833 --> 00:21:32.585
not mourn all that much.

457
00:21:33.878 --> 00:21:35.755
I lived a life
that made me proud.

458
00:21:36.964 --> 00:21:37.965
I...

459
00:21:38.966 --> 00:21:40.259
I was loved,

460
00:21:41.927 --> 00:21:43.429
and I loved in return.

461
00:21:45.097 --> 00:21:48.225
I found work that
aroused my passions.

462
00:21:48.309 --> 00:21:51.020
I believe I gave
more than I took.

463
00:21:51.103 --> 00:21:53.647
And I did my damnedest
to help people in need.

464
00:21:55.066 --> 00:21:56.567
And on top of all that,

465
00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:59.779
many a friend wrongly
accused me of having Botox

466
00:21:59.862 --> 00:22:02.948
because of how tight my skin
stayed well into my 50's.

467
00:22:04.116 --> 00:22:06.243
What more could
someone ask of a life?

468
00:22:08.287 --> 00:22:09.288
I love you all.

469
00:22:10.539 --> 00:22:12.249
Thank you for being here today.

470
00:22:15.377 --> 00:22:16.378
Goodbye.

471
00:22:18.464 --> 00:22:19.632
"Lisa."

472
00:22:25.763 --> 00:22:26.889
Cliff?

473
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:29.391
[Cliff sighs]

474
00:22:52.665 --> 00:22:54.208
Are those human remains?

475
00:22:55.376 --> 00:22:56.627
You guys have a permit for that?

476
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:58.379
Just shut the fuck up, Phillip.

477
00:22:58.462 --> 00:23:00.172
Cliff, you don't
talk to me like that.

478
00:23:00.256 --> 00:23:01.507
Fuck you. I just did.

479
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:02.859
- [Phillip] What?
- You want me to beat your ass?

480
00:23:02.883 --> 00:23:04.194
- I'm just...
- Get the fuck out of here.

481
00:23:04.218 --> 00:23:06.137
I will eat your sweater
vest for dinner.

482
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.721
- No... Yep.
- [Cliff] Bitch. Go. One.

483
00:23:07.805 --> 00:23:09.116
[Monk] Get the fuck
out of here, Phillip.

484
00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.558
- [Phillip] I'm just...
- Two.

485
00:23:10.641 --> 00:23:12.518
- Three.
- [Monk] Always been a fucking douche.

486
00:23:13.644 --> 00:23:14.770
[gentle music playing]

487
00:23:16.438 --> 00:23:18.357
[bell rings]

488
00:23:20.609 --> 00:23:21.944
[door opens]

489
00:23:22.027 --> 00:23:24.029
[piano playing]

490
00:23:29.869 --> 00:23:30.870
[Monk exhales]

491
00:23:31.787 --> 00:23:32.913
Where is everybody?

492
00:23:33.831 --> 00:23:35.457
They're exhausted.

493
00:23:35.541 --> 00:23:37.626
I gave Lorraine something
to help her sleep.

494
00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:38.836
Mother's taking a bath.

495
00:23:38.919 --> 00:23:40.119
Then I'm going to dose her too.

496
00:23:41.797 --> 00:23:44.592
You think maybe I can get
some of that later tonight?

497
00:23:44.675 --> 00:23:46.468
Yeah. What, you're
not sleeping well?

498
00:23:47.511 --> 00:23:48.762
Uh...

499
00:23:48.846 --> 00:23:51.182
Normally, I sleep
fine, but just lately.

500
00:23:53.058 --> 00:23:54.810
Yeah.

501
00:23:54.894 --> 00:23:57.855
Does seeing a dead body
ever become normal?

502
00:23:57.938 --> 00:23:59.481
I don't know. I
haven't seen many.

503
00:23:59.565 --> 00:24:00.691
[Monk] Really?

504
00:24:00.774 --> 00:24:02.401
I'm a plastic surgeon.

505
00:24:02.484 --> 00:24:04.765
If I'm looking at a corpse,
then something went very awry.

506
00:24:06.197 --> 00:24:07.198
Right.

507
00:24:09.533 --> 00:24:11.285
Yeah. Made me feel for Mother.

508
00:24:12.995 --> 00:24:15.706
Can't imagine what she must've
gone through finding Dad

509
00:24:17.499 --> 00:24:19.251
you know, like that.

510
00:24:19.335 --> 00:24:20.336
I know.

511
00:24:21.712 --> 00:24:23.130
So much death.

512
00:24:31.222 --> 00:24:33.682
When was the last time
we were here together?

513
00:24:35.184 --> 00:24:36.644
Uh...

514
00:24:36.727 --> 00:24:38.187
Maybe ten years.

515
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:39.480
[Monk] Yeah.

516
00:24:39.563 --> 00:24:40.731
The kids were still little.

517
00:24:41.565 --> 00:24:42.566
Yeah.

518
00:24:45.444 --> 00:24:47.196
How is your family, by the way?

519
00:24:48.489 --> 00:24:50.199
You actually care?

520
00:24:50.282 --> 00:24:52.910
Of course. Why would I ask?
Why would you ask me that?

521
00:24:52.993 --> 00:24:54.713
I don't know, Monk. You
never really called.

522
00:24:54.745 --> 00:24:56.705
- I get busy.
- Yeah, everybody gets busy.

523
00:24:57.665 --> 00:24:58.874
You drift away.

524
00:25:01.001 --> 00:25:02.503
You want to know
how my family is?

525
00:25:02.586 --> 00:25:05.297
My wife left me 'cause she
caught me in bed with a man.

526
00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.509
She took my house,
half my practice.

527
00:25:09.301 --> 00:25:11.053
My kids fucking hate me.

528
00:25:12.429 --> 00:25:14.098
And I still live
in fucking Tucson.

529
00:25:16.433 --> 00:25:17.810
What was wrong with Tucson?

530
00:25:17.893 --> 00:25:19.561
Oh, my God. There's one gay bar

531
00:25:19.645 --> 00:25:20.938
and it's full of college kids.

532
00:25:21.021 --> 00:25:23.065
One of them asked me
if I was Tyler Perry.

533
00:25:24.191 --> 00:25:25.276
That's terrible.

534
00:25:25.359 --> 00:25:27.736
I mean, Tyler Perry
lives in Atlanta, right?

535
00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.238
Fuck you, man.

536
00:25:29.321 --> 00:25:30.990
[both laugh]

537
00:25:31.073 --> 00:25:32.074
Shut up.

538
00:25:32.157 --> 00:25:33.237
[Monk] Nowhere near Tucson.

539
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:35.369
[Cliff] Oh, boy.

540
00:25:38.289 --> 00:25:39.707
[Monk] Did you know
Dad had affairs?

541
00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:41.250
Oh, for sure.

542
00:25:41.333 --> 00:25:42.543
How?

543
00:25:43.502 --> 00:25:45.462
You could just tell.

544
00:25:45.546 --> 00:25:48.382
Lisa told me she saw him
kissing a white woman once.

545
00:25:48.465 --> 00:25:52.011
Why did I have no idea?
Why am I the last to know?

546
00:25:52.094 --> 00:25:54.179
Because you loved him too much.

547
00:25:54.263 --> 00:25:56.557
Enemies see each other
better than friends.

548
00:25:57.891 --> 00:26:00.144
[Lorraine snoring]

549
00:26:00.227 --> 00:26:01.705
[Monk] What the hell
did you give her?

550
00:26:01.729 --> 00:26:04.273
It's oxycodone. But
knocks them right out.

551
00:26:04.356 --> 00:26:05.858
You gave her opioids to sleep?

552
00:26:05.941 --> 00:26:07.776
Yeah. You ever seen
a heroin addict?

553
00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.194
Those guys take
naps standing up.

554
00:26:09.278 --> 00:26:10.404
It's dangerous.

555
00:26:10.738 --> 00:26:12.132
Look, I'm keeping an eye
on her. I'm a doctor.

556
00:26:12.156 --> 00:26:13.324
- [Monk] So am I.
- Right.

557
00:26:13.407 --> 00:26:15.617
Maybe if we need to
revive a sentence.

558
00:26:15.701 --> 00:26:20.998
[mocks] Well, why do you
have synthetic smack anyway?

559
00:26:21.081 --> 00:26:22.958
[water dripping]

560
00:26:25.294 --> 00:26:26.378
[Cliff] What is that?

561
00:26:32.551 --> 00:26:33.677
Oh.

562
00:26:35.888 --> 00:26:36.972
[Cliff] Oh, shit.

563
00:26:37.806 --> 00:26:38.806
[knocking at door]

564
00:26:38.849 --> 00:26:39.850
[Monk] Mother?

565
00:26:42.269 --> 00:26:43.270
Mother?

566
00:26:45.022 --> 00:26:46.273
- [grunts]
- [water flowing]

567
00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:50.277
Hey.

568
00:26:50.361 --> 00:26:53.113
Hey. What are you doing? Hey.

569
00:26:54.948 --> 00:26:55.949
Mother.

570
00:26:57.659 --> 00:26:58.660
Hey.

571
00:27:05.542 --> 00:27:06.794
{\an8}Come on.

572
00:27:09.254 --> 00:27:10.255
Come on.

573
00:27:12.049 --> 00:27:14.134
[Monk] Well, I'm not sure,
to be honest with you.

574
00:27:14.218 --> 00:27:15.978
It's going to depend on
what the doctors say.

575
00:27:16.929 --> 00:27:18.764
Yeah, I'll touch base
when I know more.

576
00:27:20.015 --> 00:27:21.642
Thanks so much for
being understanding.

577
00:27:23.811 --> 00:27:27.314
Hey, um, Leo, one more thing.

578
00:27:27.398 --> 00:27:29.191
I was wondering if maybe
we could treat this

579
00:27:29.274 --> 00:27:31.944
as a sabbatical as opposed
to a leave of absence?

580
00:27:32.027 --> 00:27:33.171
Whatever happens with my mother,

581
00:27:33.195 --> 00:27:34.395
it's going to cost some money.

582
00:27:37.324 --> 00:27:38.450
No, I understand.

583
00:27:39.243 --> 00:27:40.369
No, it's not your fault.

584
00:27:41.245 --> 00:27:42.538
I'll figure something out.

585
00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:44.331
Yeah.

586
00:27:44.957 --> 00:27:45.957
Thanks for your help.

587
00:27:46.333 --> 00:27:47.543
Okay. Bye-bye.

588
00:27:49.378 --> 00:27:50.378
[Coraline] Oh.

589
00:27:54.341 --> 00:27:55.342
Oh.

590
00:27:56.051 --> 00:27:56.927
Uh...

591
00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:58.137
You don't have to do that.

592
00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.596
Oh, no. I do.

593
00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.491
It's tomato season. You
can't let them go to waste.

594
00:28:01.515 --> 00:28:03.225
- Ooh.
- A crime around here.

595
00:28:03.308 --> 00:28:04.560
[chuckles]

596
00:28:05.394 --> 00:28:06.687
[Coraline] Thank you.

597
00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:08.230
That's what neighbors
are for, right?

598
00:28:08.313 --> 00:28:09.606
Welcome to the neighborhood.

599
00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:12.734
I thought the place was vacant.

600
00:28:13.694 --> 00:28:16.363
Uh, it has been for a while.

601
00:28:16.447 --> 00:28:17.948
We just got here last night.

602
00:28:18.031 --> 00:28:20.659
Oh. Figured the
place was haunted.

603
00:28:20.742 --> 00:28:23.704
They said some old man blew his
brains out there a while back.

604
00:28:26.623 --> 00:28:27.749
Yeah.

605
00:28:30.627 --> 00:28:33.088
Oh, my God. I...

606
00:28:35.132 --> 00:28:36.425
I'm a fucking idiot.

607
00:28:37.259 --> 00:28:38.510
Please forgive me.

608
00:28:38.594 --> 00:28:39.595
Well...

609
00:28:41.305 --> 00:28:42.681
Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that.

610
00:28:43.557 --> 00:28:44.637
What'd she do for a living?

611
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:48.103
She was a doctor. Um...

612
00:28:48.187 --> 00:28:52.399
Most of my family, doctors.
Basically, I'm the outcast.

613
00:28:52.483 --> 00:28:53.567
[Coraline chuckles]

614
00:28:54.693 --> 00:28:56.361
Um, what do you do for work?

615
00:28:56.445 --> 00:28:57.445
I'm a lawyer.

616
00:28:58.071 --> 00:28:59.823
Public defense. Quincy.

617
00:29:00.908 --> 00:29:01.950
Very honorable.

618
00:29:02.034 --> 00:29:05.871
Yeah. It's very hard,
but can be rewarding.

619
00:29:07.164 --> 00:29:08.707
May I ask you something

620
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.168
that I'm sure a lot
of people ask you?

621
00:29:11.251 --> 00:29:13.629
How do I feel about
defending guilty people?

622
00:29:14.171 --> 00:29:15.171
Yeah.

623
00:29:15.214 --> 00:29:17.424
- I love it.
- Why?

624
00:29:17.508 --> 00:29:20.469
I have to. And
they're all guilty.

625
00:29:21.553 --> 00:29:23.555
- Really?
- Yes. But that's okay.

626
00:29:23.639 --> 00:29:25.557
People are more than
their worst deed.

627
00:29:27.643 --> 00:29:28.894
I guess I agree with that.

628
00:29:28.977 --> 00:29:31.104
[Coraline] Mm. Sure you do.

629
00:29:31.188 --> 00:29:32.397
You're a writer.

630
00:29:32.481 --> 00:29:34.024
[Monk] I don't follow.

631
00:29:34.107 --> 00:29:36.818
Well, writers have
to be non-judgmental.

632
00:29:36.902 --> 00:29:39.071
You can't write
interesting characters

633
00:29:39.154 --> 00:29:41.448
and be critical of every
bad decision they make.

634
00:29:41.532 --> 00:29:42.532
Right?

635
00:29:42.574 --> 00:29:43.760
Maybe you should be the writer.

636
00:29:43.784 --> 00:29:45.224
I don't feel like
much of one lately.

637
00:29:45.786 --> 00:29:46.912
You blocked?

638
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:50.666
It's just... [chuckles]

639
00:29:50.749 --> 00:29:53.168
I don't think anybody
wants to buy what I write.

640
00:29:53.252 --> 00:29:54.336
[Coraline] That's not true.

641
00:29:54.419 --> 00:29:56.129
I didn't want to say anything,

642
00:29:56.213 --> 00:29:58.298
but, um, I actually
read one of your books.

643
00:29:59.383 --> 00:30:01.093
Hm. Which?

644
00:30:01.176 --> 00:30:02.469
<i>The Frogs.</i>

645
00:30:02.553 --> 00:30:03.553
Oh, so you were the one.

646
00:30:03.595 --> 00:30:05.222
[chuckles] I liked it.

647
00:30:06.974 --> 00:30:07.975
You're talented.

648
00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:09.600
[car approaching]

649
00:30:15.023 --> 00:30:16.775
[Monk] You're expecting company?

650
00:30:18.402 --> 00:30:19.403
[Coraline] Yeah.

651
00:30:19.486 --> 00:30:21.321
- [keys jingling]
- Oh.

652
00:30:22.281 --> 00:30:24.032
[door unlocking]

653
00:30:29.496 --> 00:30:30.747
Hello.

654
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.959
- Hey.
- Jelani, uh, this is Monk.

655
00:30:34.042 --> 00:30:36.503
He and his family own the
house across the street.

656
00:30:36.587 --> 00:30:37.754
Nice to meet you.

657
00:30:38.338 --> 00:30:39.631
Yeah, it's a pleasure.

658
00:30:39.715 --> 00:30:40.795
Are you staying for dinner?

659
00:30:41.425 --> 00:30:42.426
[Monk] Uh...

660
00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:44.177
No, I need to go
check in on my mother.

661
00:30:44.261 --> 00:30:45.387
[Jelani] Cool.

662
00:30:45.971 --> 00:30:47.139
[Monk] Thank you, uh...

663
00:30:49.057 --> 00:30:50.225
[gulps]

664
00:30:50.309 --> 00:30:52.311
For the wine, and

665
00:30:53.312 --> 00:30:54.605
good night.

666
00:30:57.316 --> 00:30:58.317
Good night, Monk.

667
00:30:59.192 --> 00:31:01.069
[gentle music playing]

668
00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:12.247
[waves lapping]

669
00:31:21.923 --> 00:31:23.884
[gentle music continues]

670
00:31:28.555 --> 00:31:30.515
[seagull squawking]

671
00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.781
[Cliff sniffles]

672
00:31:49.951 --> 00:31:51.453
What time's your flight?

673
00:31:51.536 --> 00:31:52.621
11:00.

674
00:31:54.748 --> 00:31:57.542
You think, uh, maybe
you could change it?

675
00:31:57.626 --> 00:31:59.020
Think it would be
useful to have you

676
00:31:59.044 --> 00:32:00.396
at Mother's doctor's
appointment today.

677
00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:01.588
I can't. I got to get home.

678
00:32:03.715 --> 00:32:05.634
Fine, but you think
you can chip in

679
00:32:05.717 --> 00:32:07.236
for her care once we
find out what's what?

680
00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:08.613
It's probably going to
be pretty expensive.

681
00:32:08.637 --> 00:32:10.722
Things are tight
right now, so...

682
00:32:10.806 --> 00:32:12.140
You thought about
firing Lorraine?

683
00:32:15.727 --> 00:32:16.728
Lorraine is family.

684
00:32:17.521 --> 00:32:18.814
Well, shit, Monk.

685
00:32:18.897 --> 00:32:20.291
I don't know what to
tell you, all right?

686
00:32:20.315 --> 00:32:21.525
So you can't do anything?

687
00:32:21.608 --> 00:32:23.402
[sighs] I will check
with my accountant

688
00:32:23.485 --> 00:32:24.778
when I get back, all right?

689
00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:26.780
It's 8:00 in the morning.

690
00:32:26.863 --> 00:32:28.824
I'm not flying the
fucking plane, Monk.

691
00:32:33.412 --> 00:32:36.915
Well, do you think
you could be so kind

692
00:32:36.998 --> 00:32:38.500
as to go inside and see

693
00:32:38.583 --> 00:32:40.001
if Mother is ready to head out?

694
00:32:40.085 --> 00:32:41.253
All right. Hey.

695
00:32:41.336 --> 00:32:42.629
- Mother!
- Don't yell, man.

696
00:32:42.713 --> 00:32:43.714
Be civilized.

697
00:32:43.797 --> 00:32:45.799
You're just like our dad, man.

698
00:32:45.882 --> 00:32:48.135
So you do right by me, Monk.
I swear to fucking God.

699
00:32:49.469 --> 00:32:51.096
[Monk] Clown.

700
00:32:51.179 --> 00:32:52.323
[Cliff] You want
to see civilized?

701
00:32:52.347 --> 00:32:53.932
- [yelling] Mother!
- [Monk groans]

702
00:32:58.103 --> 00:32:59.104
Morning.

703
00:33:01.148 --> 00:33:02.482
[Monk] Hey. Morning.

704
00:33:03.567 --> 00:33:05.152
Listen

705
00:33:05.235 --> 00:33:07.028
- about last night, uh...
- Oh.

706
00:33:07.112 --> 00:33:08.321
It's okay.

707
00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:10.615
You don't have to explain.
I had a good time.

708
00:33:10.699 --> 00:33:11.742
No, I...

709
00:33:13.452 --> 00:33:15.996
Jelani, he's my ex.

710

00:42:08.903 --> 00:42:10.947
I thought you were
just being nice.

892
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:14.075
Oh, I'm never just being
nice. I'm too old for that.

893
00:42:14.158 --> 00:42:15.910
You know, I like you
so much, in fact,

894
00:42:15.994 --> 00:42:17.954
that I went out and got
another one of your books.

895
00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:20.290
Really? Which one?

896
00:42:20.373 --> 00:42:21.374
<i>The Haas Conundrum.</i>

897
00:42:22.625 --> 00:42:23.626
What'd you think?

898
00:42:24.544 --> 00:42:25.670
I liked it.

899
00:42:26.671 --> 00:42:29.424
Susan has really great dialogue.

900
00:42:29.507 --> 00:42:31.968
And I love the aunt.

901
00:42:32.051 --> 00:42:33.970
Wow. I mean, you
write women well.

902
00:42:34.804 --> 00:42:36.139
Oh, you think so?

903
00:42:36.222 --> 00:42:37.582
Yeah. They're not
hothouse flowers.

904
00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:38.641
Thank you.

905
00:42:40.351 --> 00:42:42.729
- I appreciate that.
- [Coraline] Mm.

906
00:42:42.812 --> 00:42:44.772
I could've done with
less footnotes though.

907
00:42:44.856 --> 00:42:46.899
[both chuckling]

908
00:42:52.447 --> 00:42:53.698
I, uh...

909
00:42:53.781 --> 00:42:54.866
I got to run.

910
00:42:57.076 --> 00:42:58.411
Well, how's your mom?

911
00:42:59.495 --> 00:43:01.497
In and out.

912
00:43:01.581 --> 00:43:03.333
I'm afraid to be
away for too long.

913
00:43:04.709 --> 00:43:05.793
- Yeah.
- But, uh...

914
00:43:08.212 --> 00:43:09.255
I'll, uh...

915
00:43:11.174 --> 00:43:12.258
I'll call you.

916
00:43:14.344 --> 00:43:15.345
Hold on a minute.

917
00:43:21.684 --> 00:43:22.602
Sign my book.

918
00:43:22.685 --> 00:43:23.686
[Monk chuckles]

919
00:43:33.738 --> 00:43:34.739
What's your name again?

920
00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:36.741
[Coraline] Hm.

921
00:43:36.824 --> 00:43:38.785
[gentle music playing]

922
00:43:56.886 --> 00:43:58.346

923
00:44:05.812 --> 00:44:07.772
[light switch clicking]

924
00:44:21.244 --> 00:44:22.245
[Lorraine] Mr. Monk?

925
00:44:27.166 --> 00:44:28.543
What's going on with the lights?

926
00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:31.421
Miss Lisa used to pay the bill.

927
00:44:32.547 --> 00:44:33.548
Did you?

00:44:34.674 --> 00:44:36.467

[inhales]

930
00:44:38.678 --> 00:44:39.846
How much?

931
00:44:39.929 --> 00:44:41.198
[Monk over phone]
<i>Well, I can handle</i>

932
00:44:41.222 --> 00:44:42.598
the electrical bills,

933
00:44:42.682 --> 00:44:44.308
but these care
facilities are expensive.

934
00:44:45.268 --> 00:44:46.727
<i>The best one nearby</i>

935
00:44:46.811 --> 00:44:51.399
is $5,600 a month, and
that's for a shared room.

936
00:44:51.482 --> 00:44:54.444
It goes up to $6,900 a
month for a private room.

937
00:44:54.527 --> 00:44:55.796
Well, why you looking
at the best one?

938
00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.238
She wasn't the best mother.

939
00:44:57.321 --> 00:44:59.049
Look, I'm not here to
re-litigate our childhoods.

940
00:44:59.073 --> 00:45:00.950
Of course not, because
yours was great.

941
00:45:01.033 --> 00:45:03.870
[Monk] <i>Goddamn it! Are you
going to help me or not?</i>

942
00:45:03.953 --> 00:45:05.872
Won't Medicaid cover
it or something?

943
00:45:05.955 --> 00:45:07.999
That's not how it works.
You don't know this?

944
00:45:08.082 --> 00:45:09.542
Oh. Hello.

945
00:45:10.293 --> 00:45:12.170
[Cliff moaning]

946
00:45:12.253 --> 00:45:14.088
[Monk] <i>Who's that?
What are you doing?</i>

947
00:45:14.172 --> 00:45:15.798
- I've taken a lover.
- [inhales]

948
00:45:15.882 --> 00:45:17.008
You've taken a lover?

949
00:45:17.216 --> 00:45:18.736
You got a problem
with that, homophobe?

950
00:45:18.926 --> 00:45:21.207
Listen, I'm not offended that
you've taken a lover, Cliff.

951
00:45:21.762 --> 00:45:22.763
I'm offended, Cliff,

952
00:45:22.847 --> 00:45:25.057
that you call it taking a lover.

953
00:45:25.141 --> 00:45:27.018
Mm, you can eat shit, nigga.

954
00:45:27.101 --> 00:45:29.437
- [cell phone beeps]
- I'll take my lover right now.

955
00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.897
Hey, where you going?

956
00:45:32.732 --> 00:45:34.901
["Don Quichotte" continues]

957
00:45:49.373 --> 00:45:50.374
There you are.

00:45:50.458 --> 00:45:52.210
Traffic was insane. What's up?

959
00:45:52.835 --> 00:45:53.836
Sit down.

960
00:45:55.838 --> 00:45:56.839
[door closes]

961
00:45:58.549 --> 00:45:59.550
Have a seat.

962
00:46:04.555 --> 00:46:05.556
We sold your book.

963
00:46:07.141 --> 00:46:08.351
[laughs]

964
00:46:08.434 --> 00:46:10.520
Holy shit!

965
00:46:10.603 --> 00:46:12.980
- I thought it was DOA.
- Not <i>The Persians.</i>

966
00:46:16.275 --> 00:46:17.151
No.

967
00:46:17.235 --> 00:46:19.779
- [chuckles]
- Get out!

968
00:46:19.862 --> 00:46:21.781
Paula Betaman from
Thompson-Watt.

969
00:46:21.864 --> 00:46:23.199
She always passes.

970
00:46:23.282 --> 00:46:27.912
Not this time. They want
to preempt for $750,000.

971
00:46:27.995 --> 00:46:30.373
No one's ever offered
that much to me.

972
00:46:30.456 --> 00:46:32.542
- This is you.
- No, it's not, Arthur.

973
00:46:32.625 --> 00:46:34.293
- [Arthur] You wrote it.
- As a joke.

974
00:46:34.377 --> 00:46:36.170
Well, now it's the
most lucrative joke

975
00:46:36.254 --> 00:46:37.338
you've ever told.

976
00:46:37.547 --> 00:46:39.107
- [Monk] And I'm not selling.
- Why not?

977
00:46:39.173 --> 00:46:41.384
Because it's trash, Arthur.

978
00:46:41.467 --> 00:46:44.053
You didn't even want to
send it out the other day.

979
00:46:44.136 --> 00:46:47.765
Oh, but look who's suddenly
overcome his fears.

980
00:46:47.848 --> 00:46:49.976
I know, I broke the
first rule of sales.

981
00:46:50.059 --> 00:46:52.270
Never underestimate
how stupid everyone is.

982
00:46:52.353 --> 00:46:55.982
Well, I'm not participating
in making them any stupider.

983
00:46:56.065 --> 00:46:57.733
Well, you haven't thus far,

984
00:46:57.817 --> 00:47:00.570
which is admirable, but

985
00:47:01.571 --> 00:47:03.072
you also haven't made any money.

986
00:47:06.492 --> 00:47:08.369
Doesn't your mom
need help these days?

987
00:47:11.539 --> 00:47:12.456
Check this out.

988
00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:14.500
[perplexing music playing]

989
00:47:16.544 --> 00:47:18.796
I don't care how drunk we
get, I'm not selling it.

990
00:47:18.879 --> 00:47:20.239
[Arthur] That's
not what I'm doing.

991
00:47:22.717 --> 00:47:25.386
Johnnie Walker Red, 24 bucks.

992
00:47:25.469 --> 00:47:27.722
Johnnie Walker Black, 50 bucks.

993
00:47:28.556 --> 00:47:30.057
Johnnie Walker Blue

994
00:47:31.183 --> 00:47:33.185
$160.

995
00:47:33.269 --> 00:47:34.270
You see the metaphor?

996
00:47:35.688 --> 00:47:36.897
No.

997
00:47:36.981 --> 00:47:39.400
These are all made
by the same company.

998
00:47:39.483 --> 00:47:41.944
The Red is shit, the
Black is less shit,

999
00:47:42.028 --> 00:47:43.696
the Blue is good.

1000
00:47:43.779 --> 00:47:46.532
But fewer people buy the
blue because it's expensive.

1001
00:47:46.616 --> 00:47:47.742
And at the end of the day,

1002
00:47:47.825 --> 00:47:49.185
most people just
want to get drunk.

1003
00:47:50.953 --> 00:47:53.122
For most of your career,
your books have been Blue.

1004
00:47:53.831 --> 00:47:56.000
They're good, complex.

1005
00:47:56.751 --> 00:47:58.002
But they're not popular

1006
00:47:58.085 --> 00:48:01.339
because most people
want something easy.

1007
00:48:01.422 --> 00:48:05.635
Now, for the first time ever,
you've written a Red book.

1008
00:48:05.718 --> 00:48:07.011
It's simple, prurient.

1009
00:48:07.094 --> 00:48:08.596
It's not great literature, but

1010
00:48:10.139 --> 00:48:11.432
satisfies an urge.

1011
00:48:13.267 --> 00:48:15.186
And that's valuable.

1012
00:48:15.269 --> 00:48:17.229
What I'm trying to
illustrate is that,

1013
00:48:17.313 --> 00:48:19.357
just because you do Red

1014
00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:22.234
doesn't mean you
can't also do Blue.

1015
00:48:22.318 --> 00:48:23.319
You can do it all.

1016
00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:25.780
Like Johnnie Walker.

1017
00:48:25.863 --> 00:48:28.449
In fact, you got Johnnie
Walker beat, because

1018
00:48:28.532 --> 00:48:30.412
you don't even have to
put your real name on it.

Yeah, I was a little confused
at first, but... [chuckles]

00:49:20.209 --> 00:49:23.087
We're both very excited to
discuss Thompson-Watt's offer.

1038
00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:24.606
Yes, well, first of
all, let me just say

1039
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:26.024
that all of us here
at Thompson-Watt

1040
00:49:26.048 --> 00:49:28.551
are thrilled with <i>My Pafology.</i>

1041
00:49:28.634 --> 00:49:30.720
It is about as perfect a book

1042
00:49:30.803 --> 00:49:32.805
as I have seen in
a long, long while.

<i>Just... just raw and real.</i>

1044
00:49:36.976 --> 00:49:40.271
And, Mr. Leigh, is this
based on your actual life?

1045
00:49:42.356 --> 00:49:44.692
Yeah, you think some
bitch-ass college boy

1046
00:49:44.775 --> 00:49:45.985
can come up with that shit?

1047
00:49:46.068 --> 00:49:47.069
No, no. No, I don't.

1048
00:49:47.945 --> 00:49:50.156
No. You know, that kind of

1049

Now, is Stagg a pseudonym?

1051
00:49:58.456 --> 00:50:00.750
Yes, uh, it is.

1052
00:50:00.833 --> 00:50:02.960
Mr. Leigh can't
use his real name

1053
00:50:03.043 --> 00:50:05.004
because he's a...

1054
00:50:06.005 --> 00:50:08.048
Well, he's a wanted fugitive.

That's why this couldn't
be a video conference.

1057
00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:15.097
Are you crazy? What if
they fact check this?

1058
00:50:15.181 --> 00:50:17.341
I checked. There's barely
money to pay editors anymore.

1059
00:50:18.058 --> 00:50:19.185
Just go with it.

1060
00:50:22.188 --> 00:50:26.817
Yeah, I did a 12-year
bid, but no going back.

1061
00:50:28.027 --> 00:50:29.236
Know what I mean?

1062
00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:31.489
Yeah. Yeah, you know, um...

1063

I've been reading a lot

00:50:34.116 --> 00:50:36.035
about the prison

00:50:36.118 --> 00:50:37.578
- Oh, God!
- [Paula] <i>I've...</i>

1066
00:50:37.661 --> 00:50:39.663
Sorry to rush, Paula,
but can we talk business?

1067
00:50:39.747 --> 00:50:42.166
Mr. Leigh values his
time outside of a cell.

1068
00:50:42.249 --> 00:50:43.375
[Paula] <i>Of course.</i>

1069
00:50:43.459 --> 00:50:44.859
I'm sure you're
both very, very busy

1070
00:50:44.919 --> 00:50:46.462
so I will get right to it.

1071
00:50:46.545 --> 00:50:48.964
Um, you'll notice
that our offer is

1072
00:50:50.299 --> 00:50:51.717
unusually large

1073
00:50:51.801 --> 00:50:54.762
<i>and that is because we believe</i>

1074
00:50:54.845 --> 00:50:57.139
Mr. Leigh has
written a bestseller.

1075
00:50:57.223 --> 00:50:59.350
We think it is going to
be the read of the summer.

1076
00:51:00.017 --> 00:51:01.727
Yeah, I'm sure

1077
00:51:01.811 --> 00:51:05.648
white people on the
Hamptons will delight in it.

1078
00:51:05.731 --> 00:51:06.982
[Paula] <i>Yes, we will.</i>

1079
00:51:07.066 --> 00:51:10.486
They... We... It's
going to be huge. Huge.

1080
00:51:11.362 --> 00:51:12.363
<i>I love it.</i>

1081
00:51:14.073 --> 00:51:16.033
[soft music playing]

1082
00:51:21.747 --> 00:51:23.833
[Maynard] Is that little
Thelonious Ellison?

1083
00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:27.837
[Monk] My God! Maynard!

1084
00:51:29.171 --> 00:51:30.673
[Maynard chuckles]

1085
00:51:30.756 --> 00:51:32.967
Everyone still call you Monk?

1086
00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:34.093
[Monk] Well,

1087
00:51:34.176 --> 00:51:35.511
everyone but you.

1088
00:51:35.594 --> 00:51:38.013
[chuckles] Well, it's
a beautiful name.

1089
00:51:38.097 --> 00:51:41.016
It seems simple not
to use it whole.

1090
00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:43.060
Well, I'm glad someone
appreciates it.

1091
00:51:44.603 --> 00:51:47.690
I heard about your
sister. My condolences.

1092
00:51:47.773 --> 00:51:48.774
Thank you.

1093
00:51:49.942 --> 00:51:51.443
I don't think I've
seen you since

1094
00:51:52.403 --> 00:51:53.904
before your father passed?

1095
00:51:53.988 --> 00:51:56.156
Yeah, it's been a
while. I live in LA now.

1096
00:51:56.907 --> 00:51:58.450
Oh! Hollywood.

1097
00:51:58.534 --> 00:52:00.703
Hey, do you write for that <i>NCIS?</i>

1098
00:52:01.579 --> 00:52:03.163
Just books.

1099
00:52:03.247 --> 00:52:06.375
Well, you should try to
write for <i>NCIS.</i> It's popular.

1100
00:52:06.458 --> 00:52:08.419
- Well, maybe I will.
- [Maynard chuckles]

1101
00:52:08.502 --> 00:52:10.421
Hey, so, how you been?

1102
00:52:10.504 --> 00:52:12.214
Oh, I'm good. And you?

1103
00:52:12.298 --> 00:52:13.382
- Yeah...
- Mr. Monk.

1104
00:52:13.465 --> 00:52:15.050
What would you like for dinner?

1105
00:52:17.928 --> 00:52:19.013
Maynard!

1106
00:52:19.096 --> 00:52:20.139
Hi, Lorraine.

1107
00:52:20.931 --> 00:52:22.516
It's been a dog's age.

1108
00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:24.727
Well, I guess it has.

1109
00:52:27.021 --> 00:52:28.188
You look well.

1110
00:52:29.523 --> 00:52:30.900
You too.

1111
00:52:30.983 --> 00:52:32.943
[playful music playing]

1112
00:52:33.986 --> 00:52:35.613
Well, I best be getting back.

1113
00:52:35.696 --> 00:52:37.364
It's good to see
you, Thelonious.

1114
00:52:37.448 --> 00:52:38.449
You too.

1115
00:52:41.076 --> 00:52:42.077
Lorraine.

1116
00:52:45.789 --> 00:52:46.957
Mm, mm, mm.

1117
00:52:47.041 --> 00:52:49.001
[playful music continues]

1118
00:52:50.628 --> 00:52:52.588
[chuckling]

1119
00:52:56.675 --> 00:52:57.801
Ain't nothing to smile at.

1120
00:52:57.885 --> 00:53:00.346
[chuckling]

1121
00:53:00.429 --> 00:53:02.932
- [knocking on door]
- [Monk] Oh! There she is.

1122
00:53:03.015 --> 00:53:04.224
Behave yourself.

1123
00:53:11.649 --> 00:53:13.525
[Coraline] Hey. Hi.

1124
00:53:15.319 --> 00:53:17.488
- Got this for you.
- [Monk] Oh, thank you.

1125
00:53:17.571 --> 00:53:19.990
- Lorraine, this is Coraline.
- Oh.

1126
00:53:20.074 --> 00:53:21.367
- Hey.
- Welcome.

1127
00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:22.493
- Yeah, hello.
- Hello.

1128
00:53:22.576 --> 00:53:23.619
Mother, perfect timing.

1129
00:53:23.702 --> 00:53:25.162
This is Coraline.

1130
00:53:25.245 --> 00:53:27.456
Hello, dear, I'm Agnes.

1131
00:53:27.539 --> 00:53:29.625
Such a pleasure to meet
you. I brought you these.

1132
00:53:29.708 --> 00:53:32.544
[gasps] Dahlias are my favorite.

1133
00:53:32.628 --> 00:53:34.213
There's a whole
world inside them.

1134
00:53:40.219 --> 00:53:41.845
- Lorraine?
- [Lorraine] Yes.

1135
00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:46.100
Mother, you sit here.

1136
00:53:48.018 --> 00:53:49.478
All right.

1137
00:53:49.561 --> 00:53:52.314
And, Coraline, why don't
you sit across from Mother?

1138
00:53:52.398 --> 00:53:53.524
[Coraline] Oh, sure, sure.

1139
00:53:57.945 --> 00:53:58.946
[sighs]

1140
00:53:59.989 --> 00:54:01.448
[Monk] Okay.

1141
00:54:03.701 --> 00:54:05.285
I'm happy you're not white.

1142
00:54:06.328 --> 00:54:07.329
Me too.

1143
00:54:16.213 --> 00:54:18.173
[soft music playing]

1144
00:54:20.217 --> 00:54:21.719
[Monk] Yeah, it
was pretty funny.

1145
00:54:22.928 --> 00:54:24.304
Well, I think you...

1146
00:54:25.472 --> 00:54:27.558
I think you remind
her of my sister.

1147
00:54:28.434 --> 00:54:29.435
[Coraline] Mm.

1148
00:54:30.811 --> 00:54:34.273
Well, do you think
we look alike?

1149
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:36.275
No, but

1150
00:54:37.484 --> 00:54:39.194
you're both self-assured,

1151
00:54:40.404 --> 00:54:41.655
and funny,

1152
00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:45.367
and you're both

1153
00:54:46.493 --> 00:54:48.704
fantastic kissers.

1154
00:54:48.787 --> 00:54:51.248
- Oh. Ooh. [Chuckles]
- [chuckles]

1155
00:55:00.466 --> 00:55:01.842
[Lorraine distantly]
Mrs. Ellison?

1156
00:55:04.344 --> 00:55:05.804
Mrs. Ellison?

1157
00:55:08.182 --> 00:55:09.475
Mr. Monk!

1158
00:55:12.936 --> 00:55:15.731
Mr. Monk!

1159
00:55:15.814 --> 00:55:17.208
- I just... I just...
- What's wrong?

1160
00:55:17.232 --> 00:55:18.859
I just stepped
outside for a moment.

1161
00:55:18.942 --> 00:55:20.110
What's wrong?

1162
00:55:20.194 --> 00:55:21.379
Having a cup of
coffee with Maynard,

1163
00:55:21.403 --> 00:55:22.821
I was right in front.

1164
00:55:22.905 --> 00:55:23.781
Where's Mother?

1165
00:55:23.864 --> 00:55:25.032
- I don't know!
- What?

1166
00:55:25.115 --> 00:55:26.492
The backdoor was open.

1167
00:55:26.575 --> 00:55:28.160
- She gone.
- What?

1168
00:55:28.243 --> 00:55:29.787
We should split up. Here.

1169
00:55:30.788 --> 00:55:32.289
I got more in the car.

1170
00:55:35.375 --> 00:55:36.376
[Monk] Mother!

1171
00:55:37.586 --> 00:55:38.587
Mother!

1172
00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:40.881
Mother!

1173
00:55:42.091 --> 00:55:43.092
Mother!

1174
00:55:44.009 --> 00:55:45.969
[solemn music playing]

1175
00:55:47.638 --> 00:55:48.639
Mother!

1176
00:55:50.849 --> 00:55:51.850
Mother.

1177
00:55:53.602 --> 00:55:55.312
[distantly] Mother!

1178
00:55:57.356 --> 00:55:58.816
Mother! Hey!

1179
00:56:00.275 --> 00:56:01.735
Mother! Mother!

1180
00:56:02.402 --> 00:56:04.071
Hey! Hey, stop!

1181
00:56:04.154 --> 00:56:05.823
Hey! Where are you going?

1182
00:56:05.906 --> 00:56:07.574
Lisa's out there

1183
00:56:07.658 --> 00:56:10.018
roughhousing with the cousins.
Somebody's going to get hurt.

1184
00:56:10.285 --> 00:56:11.954
Stop. Um...

1185
00:56:12.037 --> 00:56:15.332
I will go tell her. Okay?

1186
00:56:15.415 --> 00:56:17.584
- Yeah, but then...
- I'll take you back to the house

1187
00:56:17.668 --> 00:56:18.770
and then I will go tell her.

1188
00:56:18.794 --> 00:56:19.837
But they're out there.

1189
00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:21.380
I know, I know.

1190
00:56:21.463 --> 00:56:23.382
- Okay, you sure?
- I will tell her.

1191
00:56:23.465 --> 00:56:24.842
- Okay.
- Now, come on.

1192
00:56:24.925 --> 00:56:26.093
It's too cold out here.

1193
00:56:26.176 --> 00:56:27.761
- [Agnes] You should...
- [Monk] Okay.

1194
00:56:27.845 --> 00:56:29.471
[Agnes] Lisa doesn't
swim very well.

1195
00:56:29.555 --> 00:56:31.056
[Monk] I know. I know.

1196
00:56:31.807 --> 00:56:33.559
Okay. Almost there.

1197
00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:35.561
All right.

1198
00:56:36.478 --> 00:56:37.479
[Coraline] Oh, good.

1199
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:39.773
- Good.
- Here we go.

1200
00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:42.651
[Monk] All right.

1201
00:56:43.402 --> 00:56:44.736
[Agnes] Okay, Monkie.

1202
00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:45.863
[Monk] All right.

1203
00:56:52.494 --> 00:56:55.038
And this is our library.

1204
00:56:55.122 --> 00:56:57.916
It's full of all the classics.
And we try to get some

1205
00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.001
new releases too.

1206
00:57:02.254 --> 00:57:04.089
Do you like to
read, Mrs. Ellison?

1207
00:57:04.173 --> 00:57:05.174
No.

1208
00:57:05.591 --> 00:57:07.134
That's not true.

1209
00:57:07.217 --> 00:57:09.178
She loves to read. She
taught me to love reading.

1210
00:57:10.012 --> 00:57:11.013
Perhaps we can get

1211
00:57:11.096 --> 00:57:12.323
some of your son's
books in here.

1212
00:57:12.347 --> 00:57:13.599
And you can lead a book club.

1213
00:57:13.682 --> 00:57:14.683
[Agnes] Hm.

1214
00:57:18.395 --> 00:57:19.980
Sorry.

1215
00:57:20.063 --> 00:57:22.208
It's fine. It's hard for a
lot of the residents at first.

1216
00:57:22.232 --> 00:57:23.650
But she'll settle in.

1217
00:57:23.734 --> 00:57:24.860
Right.

1218
00:57:26.486 --> 00:57:28.238
I appreciate all your help,

1219
00:57:28.322 --> 00:57:30.949
but how soon do you
think we can get her in?

1220
00:57:31.033 --> 00:57:32.618
Uh, in about a month.

1221
00:57:32.701 --> 00:57:34.786
You can start the paperwork
today if you'd like.

1222
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:36.670
- Great. I'd like that.
- [cell phone ringing]

1223
00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:39.499
I'll go check on your mom, okay?

1224
00:57:39.583 --> 00:57:40.584
Thank you.

1225
00:57:40.667 --> 00:57:42.377
[cell phone ringing]

1226
00:57:42.461 --> 00:57:43.795
[pensive music playing]

1227
00:57:45.172 --> 00:57:47.090
- Hello?
- [Carl] <i>Hey, Thelonious.</i>

1228
00:57:47.174 --> 00:57:48.800
How you doing? My
name is Carl Brunt.

1229
00:57:49.509 --> 00:57:50.677
I am the director

1230
00:57:50.761 --> 00:57:52.346
of the New England
Book Association.

1231
00:57:52.429 --> 00:57:54.932
Hi, Carl. I know who you are.

1232
00:57:55.015 --> 00:57:57.267
[Carl] <i>Oh, good. Then
perhaps you'll also know</i>

1233
00:57:57.351 --> 00:57:59.353
that each year my
organization bestows

1234
00:57:59.436 --> 00:58:03.148
the somewhat pretentiously
named Literary Award.

1235
00:58:03.232 --> 00:58:06.068
Every writer knows the
Literary Award, Carl.

1236
00:58:06.151 --> 00:58:08.028
Especially those of
us who haven't won it.

1237
00:58:08.111 --> 00:58:11.156
[chuckles] Yeah. Yeah.

1238
00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:13.825
Well, that's sort of
related to why I'm calling.

1239
00:58:13.909 --> 00:58:15.452
Like many American institutions,

1240
00:58:15.535 --> 00:58:17.287
mine was recently
rattled by the notion

1241
00:58:17.371 --> 00:58:19.122
that our lack of diversity

1242
00:58:19.206 --> 00:58:21.500
had led to a blind
spot in our work.

1243
00:58:21.583 --> 00:58:24.211
So, you know, we're kind
of trying to remedy that.

1244
00:58:24.294 --> 00:58:25.396
<i>And to that end, I was wondering</i>

1245
00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:26.797
<i>how you might feel</i>

1246
00:58:27.047 --> 00:58:29.007
<i>about being a judge in
this year's award ceremony?</i>

1247
00:58:29.925 --> 00:58:32.761
Um, let me say first,

1248
00:58:32.844 --> 00:58:35.055
<i>Carl, that I'm
honored you choose me</i>

1249
00:58:35.138 --> 00:58:37.808
out of all the Black writers
you could go to out of fear

1250
00:58:37.891 --> 00:58:39.017
of being called racist.

1251
00:58:39.101 --> 00:58:41.228
Yeah, you're very welcome.

1252
00:58:41.311 --> 00:58:44.940
But I think this sounds
like a lot of work.

1253
00:58:45.023 --> 00:58:46.483
Yeah, I can't deny that.

1254
00:58:46.566 --> 00:58:48.544
I mean, you're going to have
to read dozens of books.

1255
00:58:48.568 --> 00:58:50.570
We could offer you
a modest stipend.

1256
00:58:51.488 --> 00:58:52.489
Even so, I'm not sure.

1257
00:58:53.115 --> 00:58:54.283
[Carl] <i>Okay.</i>

1258
00:58:54.366 --> 00:58:55.784
One of the crass
perk I reference

1259
00:58:55.867 --> 00:58:57.553
when people are kind of
on the fence like this

1260
00:58:57.577 --> 00:58:59.371
is that this will allow
you the opportunity

1261
00:58:59.454 --> 00:59:01.623
to literally judge these
other writers for once,

1262
00:59:01.707 --> 00:59:02.907
rather than just figuratively.

1263
00:59:04.501 --> 00:59:05.794
All right, I'm in.

1264
00:59:05.877 --> 00:59:07.212
[Carl] <i>Well, fantastic. Okay.</i>

1265
00:59:07.421 --> 00:59:09.965
Great. So you're going
to be one of five judges.

1266
00:59:10.048 --> 00:59:12.634
Uh, the only one we
have confirmed so far

1267
00:59:12.718 --> 00:59:14.011
is Sintara Golden.

1268
00:59:14.094 --> 00:59:15.488
Are you familiar with
Sintara Golden's work?

1269
00:59:15.512 --> 00:59:16.847
[dramatic music plays]

1270
00:59:18.307 --> 00:59:19.766
Vaguely.

1271
00:59:19.850 --> 00:59:21.970
[Carl] <i>Oh, she's great.
You're going to love her, man.</i>

1272
00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:26.231
[soft music playing]

1273
00:59:27.607 --> 00:59:30.527
[Lorraine] I brought
you lunch, Mr. Monk.

1274
00:59:31.737 --> 00:59:32.821
Oh, wow.

1275
00:59:36.074 --> 00:59:37.451
To what do I owe the pleasure?

1276
00:59:37.534 --> 00:59:40.120
[Lorraine] Well, I
have a favor to ask.

1277
00:59:42.831 --> 00:59:44.249
I was wondering
if I might be able

1278
00:59:44.333 --> 00:59:45.834
to take the afternoon off.

1279
00:59:47.377 --> 00:59:49.296
Maynard just came
in from the beach.

1280
00:59:49.379 --> 00:59:50.964
And we thought it might be nice

1281
00:59:51.048 --> 00:59:52.549
to visit a museum.

1282
00:59:52.632 --> 00:59:54.343
Yes, of course.

1283
00:59:54.426 --> 00:59:56.428
I'm free today, so I
can look after Mother.

1284
01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:02.851
Lorraine.

1285
01:00:03.852 --> 01:00:04.895
[Lorraine] Hm?

1286
01:00:04.978 --> 01:00:05.979
You really like him, huh?

1287
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:09.858
He's a fine man.

1288
01:00:10.609 --> 01:00:12.569
[gentle music continues]

1289
01:00:15.238 --> 01:00:17.199
[cell phone ringing]

1290
01:00:19.701 --> 01:00:20.702
Yeah.

1291
01:00:22.287 --> 01:00:24.122
[Arthur] Page seven.
It's got like 12.

1292
01:00:25.457 --> 01:00:29.211
[chuckles] The guests of honor.

1293
01:00:29.294 --> 01:00:32.464
Hello, Mrs. Ellison.
Looking beautiful as ever.

1294
01:00:32.547 --> 01:00:33.840
Hello, Arthur.

1295
01:00:36.426 --> 01:00:38.237
Layne, would you take Mrs.
Ellison to the kitchen,

1296
01:00:38.261 --> 01:00:39.805
and set her up with some tea?

1297
01:00:39.888 --> 01:00:41.014
Right this way, ma'am.

1298
01:00:41.098 --> 01:00:42.099
Mother, I won't be long.

1299
01:00:42.933 --> 01:00:44.059
[Agnes] Take your time.

1300
01:00:45.394 --> 01:00:46.561
- Thank you.
- [Layne] Mm-hm.

1301
01:00:47.479 --> 01:00:48.855
- Not the pods.
- [exhales]

1302
01:00:48.939 --> 01:00:51.066
The good tea, for guests.

1303
01:00:53.402 --> 01:00:55.487
What is this? I told
you to dress street.

1304
01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:58.073
- I did.
- Fucking Sesame Street.

1305
01:00:59.533 --> 01:01:01.326
What's this guy's name?

1306
01:01:01.410 --> 01:01:03.662
- Willy?
- Wiley. Wiley Valdespino.

1307
01:01:03.745 --> 01:01:06.498
He specializes in
Oscar-baity "issue" movies.

1308
01:01:06.581 --> 01:01:09.042
He did the <i>Middle
Passage</i> one last year.

1309
01:01:09.126 --> 01:01:10.395
[Monk] Somehow I
didn't see that.

1310
01:01:10.419 --> 01:01:11.813
Of course, not. You're
not lobotomized.

1311
01:01:11.837 --> 01:01:13.213
But if he adapts your book,

1312
01:01:13.296 --> 01:01:14.965
you stand to make
a lot of money.

1313
01:01:15.048 --> 01:01:16.591
Why can't we just
do a phone call?

1314
01:01:16.675 --> 01:01:18.528
Well, he said if he's going
to cut a check this large,

1315
01:01:18.552 --> 01:01:20.178
then he needs to meet in person.

1316
01:01:20.262 --> 01:01:21.263
All right.

1317
01:01:22.097 --> 01:01:24.015
[sighs] What do I need to do?

1318
01:01:24.099 --> 01:01:25.142
Just make him like you.

1319
01:01:25.225 --> 01:01:26.476
When I talked to him,

1320
01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.228
he seemed thrilled
that you're a fugitive.

1321
01:01:28.311 --> 01:01:29.646
Just, you know, play that up.

1322
01:01:29.729 --> 01:01:31.022
But what if he recognizes me?

1323
01:01:31.106 --> 01:01:32.291
- [Arthur] You?
- Yeah, the real me.

1324
01:01:32.315 --> 01:01:34.484
Monk, you're not that famous.

1325
01:01:34.568 --> 01:01:35.986
And nobody in Hollywood reads.

1326
01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:37.779
They got their assistants
to read things,

1327
01:01:37.863 --> 01:01:38.989
and then summarize them.

1328
01:01:39.072 --> 01:01:40.740
The whole town runs
on book reports.

1329
01:01:42.325 --> 01:01:43.827
You sure you can
look after my mother?

1330
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:45.162
She won't leave my sight.

1331
01:01:45.245 --> 01:01:46.845
You'll just be across
the street, anyway.

1332
01:01:48.039 --> 01:01:49.166
[Monk] Across the street.

1333
01:01:49.249 --> 01:01:50.449
You should go. You'll be late.

1334
01:01:51.209 --> 01:01:52.461
He's waiting for you.

1335
01:01:54.337 --> 01:01:56.089
Well

1336
01:01:56.173 --> 01:01:59.718
if he, uh, wants the stereotype,

1337
01:01:59.801 --> 01:02:00.927
[clears throat]

1338
01:02:01.011 --> 01:02:02.095
maybe it's better I'm late.

1339
01:02:03.346 --> 01:02:05.307
[lively music playing]

1340
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:29.206
Stagg, I presume?

1341
01:02:30.081 --> 01:02:31.082
That's me.

1342
01:02:31.166 --> 01:02:33.251
Hey, I'm Wiley.

1343
01:02:33.335 --> 01:02:34.375
Nice to meet you, brother.

1344
01:02:38.715 --> 01:02:39.716
[Monk clears throat]

1345
01:02:41.676 --> 01:02:43.345
Sorry about the
bougie restaurant.

1346
01:02:43.428 --> 01:02:45.305
My assistant picked it.

1347
01:02:45.388 --> 01:02:47.599
We can go somewhere else
if you're uncomfortable.

1348
01:02:47.682 --> 01:02:49.100
- This is fine.
- Okay.

1349
01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:51.811
What are you drinking?

1350
01:02:52.646 --> 01:02:53.647
[Monk sighs]

1351
01:02:54.439 --> 01:02:55.941
I'll have a Chenin Blanc.

1352
01:02:56.024 --> 01:02:57.192
[server] All right.

1353
01:02:57.275 --> 01:02:58.276
Of your driest.

1354
01:02:58.944 --> 01:03:00.195
[chuckles]

1355
01:03:00.278 --> 01:03:02.322
[Monk] Well, what's funny?

1356
01:03:02.405 --> 01:03:04.325
Ah, it's just a strange
order for a guy like you.

1357
01:03:04.991 --> 01:03:06.493
Why is that?

1358
01:03:06.576 --> 01:03:08.870
Well, you don't see many
convicts drinking white wine.

1359
01:03:09.746 --> 01:03:11.915
You know many convicts?

1360
01:03:11.998 --> 01:03:13.124
You'd be surprised.

1361
01:03:13.208 --> 01:03:15.627
I spent a month in
the joint myself.

1362
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:17.063
It was some interstate
commerce shit.

1363
01:03:17.087 --> 01:03:18.807
It was a short stay,
but I'll tell you what,

1364
01:03:19.339 --> 01:03:21.132
that experience grounded me.

1365
01:03:21.216 --> 01:03:22.968
The people I met in
there allowed me to see

1366
01:03:23.051 --> 01:03:25.512
a whole world of
underrepresented stories

1367
01:03:25.595 --> 01:03:27.514
from underrepresented
storytellers.

1368
01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:30.600
Can I ask what you were in for?

1369
01:03:30.684 --> 01:03:33.812
I don't like to talk about that.

1370
01:03:35.146 --> 01:03:36.147
You feel me?

1371
01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:37.691
Was it murder?

1372
01:03:38.567 --> 01:03:39.943
You said that, not me.

1373
01:03:41.194 --> 01:03:42.195
[Wiley sighs]

1374
01:03:43.154 --> 01:03:44.406
You know,

1375
01:03:44.489 --> 01:03:46.157
I got to tell you,
before you showed up,

1376
01:03:46.241 --> 01:03:49.077
I was a little worried
you might be a phony.

1377
01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:50.620
A lot of fakes in Hollywood.

1378
01:03:50.704 --> 01:03:52.122
Well, I'm not from Hollywood.

1379
01:03:52.205 --> 01:03:53.540
Yeah, yeah, no. That's obvious.

1380
01:03:53.623 --> 01:03:54.916
That's obvious.

1381
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.168
Clearly, you're cut
from a different cloth

1382
01:03:57.252 --> 01:03:58.253
than your average

1383
01:03:59.254 --> 01:04:00.505
screenwriter.

1384
01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:01.857
- Let me ask you...
- [distant siren wailing]

1385
01:04:01.881 --> 01:04:03.276
I know they sent you
some of my stuff.

1386
01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.100
Did you have a chance
to see any of my movies?

1387
01:04:07.512 --> 01:04:09.389
[hesitates] Sorry,
what did you say?

1388
01:04:09.472 --> 01:04:10.672
Have you seen any of my movies?

1389
01:04:11.182 --> 01:04:12.976
Uh, no.

1390
01:04:13.059 --> 01:04:14.185
Okay.

1391
01:04:14.269 --> 01:04:15.604
Well, look, what I like to do

1392
01:04:15.687 --> 01:04:19.441
is I like to pair genre
with real-world pathos.

1393
01:04:19.524 --> 01:04:21.067
It kind of elevates things.

1394
01:04:21.151 --> 01:04:22.378
You might be
interested in this one

1395
01:04:22.402 --> 01:04:23.602
we're about to shoot actually.

1396
01:04:24.404 --> 01:04:26.197
It's about this white couple.

1397
01:04:26.281 --> 01:04:28.992
They get married on an old
plantation in Louisiana.

1398
01:04:29.075 --> 01:04:30.744
Then all the slave
ghosts come back,

1399
01:04:30.827 --> 01:04:31.911
and they murder everyone.

1400
01:04:31.995 --> 01:04:33.955
- Dear God.
- [Wiley] I know. I know.

1401
01:04:34.039 --> 01:04:35.516
- It's great, right?
- [siren wailing]

1402
01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:37.125
It's called <i>Plantation
Annihilation.</i>

1403
01:04:37.208 --> 01:04:39.419
Ryan Reynolds is going
to get decapitated

1404
01:04:39.502 --> 01:04:41.546
with an afro pick in
the opening scene.

1405
01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:42.964
[gags] He's a friend.

1406
01:04:43.632 --> 01:04:44.633
[Monk] Got to go.

1407
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:49.512
[frantic music playing]

1408
01:04:51.348 --> 01:04:53.224
[breathing heavily]

1409
01:04:55.685 --> 01:04:59.147
Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother!

1410
01:05:05.028 --> 01:05:07.030
[mellow music playing]

1411
01:05:11.034 --> 01:05:12.869
Some ad exec on the third floor

1412
01:05:12.952 --> 01:05:14.192
- had an aneurysm.
- [urinating]

1413
01:05:14.245 --> 01:05:15.914
- Awful.
- I know.

1414
01:05:15.997 --> 01:05:17.457
Imagine exploding your brain

1415
01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:19.376
trying to think of a
toilet paper commercial.

1416
01:05:21.544 --> 01:05:23.046
I assume Wiley isn't interested.

1417
01:05:23.129 --> 01:05:26.091
I sprinted out of there
like a complete maniac.

1418
01:05:26.174 --> 01:05:29.928
Actually, he's offering
$4 million for the rights.

1419
01:05:30.011 --> 01:05:32.222
- What?
- [chuckles] Yeah, man.

1420
01:05:32.305 --> 01:05:33.640
He called you the real deal.

1421
01:05:33.723 --> 01:05:34.974
Said you took off the moment

1422
01:05:35.058 --> 01:05:36.698
- you heard police sirens.
- [zipper zips]

1423
01:05:37.352 --> 01:05:39.813
The dumber I behave,
the richer I get.

1424
01:05:39.896 --> 01:05:42.273
Now you know why my parents
moved here from Puerto Rico.

1425
01:05:43.608 --> 01:05:45.985
[urinal flushes]

1426
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:48.214
[Wilson over screen] <i>I mean,
we can't be expected to read</i>

1427
01:05:48.238 --> 01:05:51.199
<i>every novel all the
way through, right?</i>

1428
01:05:51.282 --> 01:05:53.201
No, people have worked
hard on these books.

1429
01:05:53.284 --> 01:05:54.452
And we have to respect that.

1430
01:05:54.536 --> 01:05:56.162
Well, hard work
doesn't demand respect.

1431
01:05:56.246 --> 01:05:57.372
I mean, you know,

1432
01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:58.974
people worked hard
on the Third Reich.

1433
01:05:58.998 --> 01:06:02.836
Yeah, well, I feel
that we owe it to them

1434
01:06:02.919 --> 01:06:04.254
to read every page.

1435
01:06:04.337 --> 01:06:05.797
That is such horseshit.

1436
01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.549
I mean, most of it's going to be

1437
01:06:07.632 --> 01:06:09.926
that Knausgard
auto-fiction crap, anyhow.

1438
01:06:10.009 --> 01:06:11.195
I tell you something right now,

1439
01:06:11.219 --> 01:06:12.679
I'm not reading 600 pages

1440
01:06:12.762 --> 01:06:14.431
about some pretentious jackwagon

1441
01:06:14.514 --> 01:06:15.807
discovering masturbation.

1442
01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:17.308
<i>Sorry.</i>

1443
01:06:17.392 --> 01:06:19.728
Okay, look, I think we're
all experienced enough

1444
01:06:19.811 --> 01:06:21.187
to assess the general quality

1445
01:06:21.271 --> 01:06:23.064
of something within 100 pages.

1446
01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:25.567
If you want to read beyond that,

1447
01:06:25.650 --> 01:06:26.818
that's your prerogative.

1448
01:06:26.901 --> 01:06:29.404
[sighs] Well, how
do you feel, Monk?

1449
01:06:29.487 --> 01:06:32.240
Um, I agree with
Sintara, actually.

1450
01:06:32.323 --> 01:06:34.492
I think 100 pages is sufficient.

1451
01:06:34.576 --> 01:06:36.369
You know, this is
all a crock, anyway.

1452
01:06:36.453 --> 01:06:38.997
I mean, pitting art against
other art for awards,

1453
01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.749
like, it's not subjective.

1454
01:06:40.832 --> 01:06:42.459
<i>It's absurd.</i>

1455
01:06:42.542 --> 01:06:44.353
Then why did you agree to be
a judge if you feel that way?

1456
01:06:44.377 --> 01:06:47.172
Well, because it's either me
or some other Brooklyn hack

1457
01:06:47.255 --> 01:06:48.441
who doesn't think
there's a world

1458
01:06:48.465 --> 01:06:50.049
beyond the Hudson River, Ailene.

1459
01:06:50.133 --> 01:06:53.803
It's the East River if
you're in Brooklyn, Daniel.

1460
01:06:53.887 --> 01:06:54.721
[Sintara] <i>You know what,</i>

1461
01:06:54.804 --> 01:06:56.431
art is subjective.

1462
01:06:56.514 --> 01:06:59.142
But I think this
is an opportunity

1463
01:06:59.225 --> 01:07:03.438
to highlight books that may
otherwise be undervalued.

1464
01:07:03.521 --> 01:07:05.690
<i>Book sales are
plummeting right now.</i>

1465
01:07:05.774 --> 01:07:08.151
So, perhaps this
award can give someone

1466
01:07:08.234 --> 01:07:10.361
a real chance at a
career in this industry.

1467
01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.281
Hear, hear.

1468
01:07:14.574 --> 01:07:15.909
Um...

1469
01:07:15.992 --> 01:07:17.452
Where do you want this, Mother?

1470
01:07:18.703 --> 01:07:20.079
Thought it might look nice here

1471
01:07:20.163 --> 01:07:21.206
with this natural light.

1472
01:07:22.165 --> 01:07:23.333
I don't care.

1473
01:07:23.416 --> 01:07:25.168
I never liked that
painting, anyway.

1474
01:07:25.251 --> 01:07:27.091
[classical music playing
over speakers faintly]

1475
01:07:27.128 --> 01:07:28.463
Okay.

1476
01:07:28.546 --> 01:07:31.424
Uh, well, I'll
bring some more art

1477
01:07:31.508 --> 01:07:32.759
from home next week.

1478
01:07:32.842 --> 01:07:35.261
And you just tell me
the pieces you like,

1479
01:07:35.345 --> 01:07:37.263
- and I'll bring them.
- [knocking on door]

1480
01:07:37.347 --> 01:07:39.667
[orderly] We've got your lunch
ready for you, Mrs. Ellison.

1481
01:07:40.683 --> 01:07:43.561
Oh, it looks great. What is it?

1482
01:07:43.645 --> 01:07:46.856
It's roasted turkey and
Havarti on 12-grain.

1483
01:07:48.191 --> 01:07:49.734
Sounds delicious.

1484
01:07:49.818 --> 01:07:52.403
Mrs. Ellison
prefers white bread.

1485
01:07:52.487 --> 01:07:53.822
And she doesn't like the crust.

1486
01:07:54.656 --> 01:07:56.032
As much as this place costs,

1487
01:07:56.115 --> 01:07:57.826
y'all should get the
sandwiches right.

1488
01:07:57.909 --> 01:07:59.911
I'll make sure that
we take care of that

1489
01:07:59.994 --> 01:08:01.162
from now on, okay?

1490
01:08:01.246 --> 01:08:03.540
And enjoy your
lunch, Mrs. Ellison.

1491
01:08:06.584 --> 01:08:07.585
[door closes]

1492
01:08:13.925 --> 01:08:14.926
I'm getting married.

1493
01:08:15.802 --> 01:08:16.803
- Shut up.
- What?

1494
01:08:19.264 --> 01:08:22.058
I didn't say nothing
earlier. I was just so sad.

1495
01:08:22.141 --> 01:08:26.604
But Maynard asked me yesterday.

1496
01:08:26.688 --> 01:08:30.692
- [Monk chuckles]
- Lorraine, that's amazing.

1497
01:08:30.775 --> 01:08:32.694
- I mean, let's celebrate.
- [Lorraine] Mm-mm!

1498
01:08:32.777 --> 01:08:34.779
Just too much excitement.

1499
01:08:34.863 --> 01:08:36.906
I don't like being the
center of attention.

1500
01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:38.825
Well, you deserve it, Lorraine.

1501
01:08:38.908 --> 01:08:41.160
And Maynard is a lucky man.

1502
01:08:41.244 --> 01:08:42.245
[chuckles]

1503
01:08:45.498 --> 01:08:46.958
Do you think you'd be willing

1504
01:08:47.041 --> 01:08:48.960
to walk me down the
aisle, Mr. Monk?

1505
01:08:49.043 --> 01:08:51.045
[music playing softly]

1506
01:08:52.839 --> 01:08:53.840
I'd be honored.

1507
01:08:59.095 --> 01:09:01.848
Wow. Wow. [Chuckles]

1508
01:09:04.934 --> 01:09:06.203
[Paula over phone]
<i>We are wildly excited</i>

1509
01:09:06.227 --> 01:09:07.645
<i>to help you get</i> My Pafology <i>out.</i>

1510
01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:09.439
<i>The marketing team has all kinds</i>

1511
01:09:09.522 --> 01:09:11.524
<i>of great ideas to
help you sell it.</i>

1512
01:09:11.608 --> 01:09:13.776
Great. We're excited to hear.

1513
01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:15.460
John Bosco is the head
of the department.

1514
01:09:15.486 --> 01:09:16.646
I will let him tell you more.

1515
01:09:17.113 --> 01:09:18.114
Hi, Stagg.

1516
01:09:19.198 --> 01:09:20.283
Hello.

1517
01:09:20.366 --> 01:09:22.201
Nice to finally
meet you, my man.

1518
01:09:22.911 --> 01:09:25.038
Listen, I love the book.

1519
01:09:25.121 --> 01:09:28.291
And we are going to
sell many, many copies.

1520
01:09:28.374 --> 01:09:30.627
There's already so much buzz
because of the movie deal.

1521
01:09:30.710 --> 01:09:32.962
And we just want to keep
that momentum going.

1522
01:09:33.046 --> 01:09:34.797
I spoke to Wiley yesterday.

1523
01:09:34.881 --> 01:09:36.758
He says Michael B.
Jordan is circling.

1524
01:09:36.841 --> 01:09:38.092
[Paula] <i>We heard.</i>

1525
01:09:38.176 --> 01:09:39.320
<i>We think he would be
absolutely perfect.</i>

1526
01:09:39.344 --> 01:09:40.470
<i>You know, this book,</i>

1527
01:09:40.553 --> 01:09:42.513
it's awards-bait
with a capital B.

1528
01:09:42.597 --> 01:09:44.450
And we're thinking that
if Michael does sign on,

1529
01:09:44.474 --> 01:09:45.674
we want to put him on the cover

1530
01:09:45.725 --> 01:09:47.852
in one of those, um, scarves,

1531
01:09:47.936 --> 01:09:49.856
I guess you would call
them, tied round his head.

1532
01:09:50.396 --> 01:09:51.648
A durag?

1533
01:09:51.856 --> 01:09:54.484
[John] <i>Durag. That's
it. Durag and a tank top</i>

1534
01:09:54.567 --> 01:09:55.818
with the muscles showing.

1535
01:09:55.902 --> 01:09:57.338
Ooh, somebody call
the fire department.

1536
01:09:57.362 --> 01:09:58.464
- [John] <i>Yummy.</i>
- [John and Paula laughing]

1537
01:09:58.488 --> 01:09:59.614
[imitates gunshot]

1538
01:09:59.697 --> 01:10:01.783
Shit. Sorry. Your dad. Sorry.

1539
01:10:01.866 --> 01:10:04.160
[John] <i>So listen,
for a release date,</i>

1540
01:10:04.243 --> 01:10:05.828
we're thinking of rushing it,

1541
01:10:05.912 --> 01:10:07.192
so that we can
get it out in time

1542
01:10:07.246 --> 01:10:08.164
- for Juneteenth.
- Yeah.

1543
01:10:08.247 --> 01:10:09.749
Juneteenth?

1544
01:10:09.832 --> 01:10:12.627
[John] <i>We're thinking of
making a big holiday push.</i>

1545
01:10:12.710 --> 01:10:14.295
Black people will
be celebrating,

1546
01:10:14.379 --> 01:10:15.964
white people will be feeling,

1547
01:10:16.047 --> 01:10:18.925
let's be honest, a little
conscious-stricken.

1548
01:10:19.008 --> 01:10:21.111
<i>We think it's going to be a
huge moment for your book.</i>

1549
01:10:21.135 --> 01:10:22.178
[Monk groans]

1550
01:10:22.261 --> 01:10:23.447
- [Paula chuckles]
- So, Stagg,

1551
01:10:23.471 --> 01:10:24.847
are you so, so happy?

1552
01:10:26.391 --> 01:10:29.852
We think it's great,
John, really. Amazing.

1553
01:10:31.229 --> 01:10:32.522
Yeah, it's, uh...

1554
01:10:33.648 --> 01:10:34.649
It's great.

1555
01:10:35.692 --> 01:10:38.945
And, you know, I've got an idea

1556
01:10:39.028 --> 01:10:41.030
I want to share with you two.

1557
01:10:41.114 --> 01:10:42.448
[Paula] <i>Oh, well,</i>

1558
01:10:42.532 --> 01:10:43.884
<i>I mean, we always love
to hear great ideas.</i>

1559
01:10:43.908 --> 01:10:45.302
- [John] <i>Oh, yeah, cool.</i>
- [Paula] <i>Yeah.</i>

1560
01:10:45.326 --> 01:10:46.661
I want to change the title.

1561
01:10:47.578 --> 01:10:48.705
Uh...

1562
01:10:48.788 --> 01:10:49.872
- I don't...
- Okay.

1563
01:10:49.956 --> 01:10:51.416
Um, well, just to be clear,

1564
01:10:51.499 --> 01:10:53.084
we really do love.

1565
01:10:53.167 --> 01:10:54.502
<i>- My Pafology.</i>
- Love it.

1566
01:10:54.585 --> 01:10:56.713
It's got that whole Irvine Welsh

1567
01:10:56.796 --> 01:10:58.923
- proletarian vernacular thing.
- Yeah.

1568
01:10:59.007 --> 01:11:00.675
[Monk] No, and
that's why I think

1569
01:11:00.758 --> 01:11:02.969
you're going to love
this new title even more.

1570
01:11:03.928 --> 01:11:05.263
Well, okay, you know what,

1571
01:11:05.346 --> 01:11:08.850
we're always happy
to hear new ideas.

1572
01:11:08.933 --> 01:11:10.309
<i>What did you have in mind?</i>

1573
01:11:10.393 --> 01:11:11.394
<i>Fuck.</i>

1574
01:11:17.525 --> 01:11:18.525
[Paula stammers]

1575
01:11:18.568 --> 01:11:19.861
I'm sorry. Pardon me.

1576
01:11:19.944 --> 01:11:20.945
<i>Fuck.</i>

1577
01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.823
I want to call it <i>Fuck.</i>

1578
01:11:24.949 --> 01:11:27.035
[laughs nervously]

1579
01:11:27.118 --> 01:11:29.037
- What are you doing?
- Screw these idiots.

1580
01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.288
- Stop it.
- No.

1581
01:11:32.874 --> 01:11:35.877
[Paula] <i>So, Stagg, what
about, uh, like,</i> Damn?

1582
01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:38.421
- [John] <i>Mm-hm.</i>
- [Paula] Damn? <i>Or</i> Hell?

1583
01:11:39.422 --> 01:11:40.757
Nah. <i>Fuck.</i>

1584
01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:42.967
Okay, that's cool. Uh...

1585
01:11:43.051 --> 01:11:46.679
But maybe we could do
that with a PH instead

1586
01:11:46.763 --> 01:11:47.906
<i>because that would
be more palatable...</i>

1587
01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:49.170
- Yes. Yes.
<i>- to our sellers.</i>

1588
01:11:49.223 --> 01:11:51.059
I don't care about all that.

1589
01:11:51.142 --> 01:11:54.312
And if you don't change
the title, the deal is off.

1590
01:11:54.395 --> 01:11:55.855
- Oh, yeah. No.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1591
01:11:55.938 --> 01:11:58.816
- There's no need to be hasty.
- No, no, no.

1592
01:11:59.567 --> 01:12:00.568
You know what?

1593
01:12:01.569 --> 01:12:02.445
Why don't we...

1594
01:12:02.528 --> 01:12:03.571
Juts give us a second

1595
01:12:03.654 --> 01:12:06.324
and, um, a moment

1596
01:12:06.407 --> 01:12:08.242
and we will get right
back to you, okay?

1597
01:12:08.993 --> 01:12:10.244
What are you doing?

1598
01:12:10.328 --> 01:12:11.764
What are you doing?
This is ridiculous.

1599
01:12:11.788 --> 01:12:13.015
Do you know how much
money we're talking about?

1600
01:12:13.039 --> 01:12:14.391
I don't care, I'm
shutting it down.

1601
01:12:14.415 --> 01:12:15.809
- Shutting it... Come on.
- Shutting it down.

1602
01:12:15.833 --> 01:12:17.473
- [Paula] <i>Are you there?</i>
- Please, just

1603

1604
01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:22.381
Let's do it.

1605
01:12:23.174 --> 01:12:24.175
- What?
- What?

1606
01:12:24.675 --> 01:12:25.802
Yeah. We discussed it,

1607
01:12:25.885 --> 01:12:27.071
and we think it is
very in your face

1608
01:12:27.095 --> 01:12:28.596
in the best way possible.

1609
01:12:28.679 --> 01:12:30.264
[John] <i>It is very, uh</i>

[Paula stammers] <i>Uh...</i>

- [John] <i>That's it.</i>

1612
01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:36.687
<i>Yes, that's it.</i>

1613
01:12:36.771 --> 01:12:38.106
<i>I'm happy you said
it, and not me.</i>

[Paula] <i>Oh, fuck.</i>

1616
01:12:41.359 --> 01:12:42.628
- It's fucking great, Stagg.
- I love it.

1617
01:12:42.652 --> 01:12:44.195
- Yes. [Chuckles]
- Oh, my...

1618
01:12:44.278 --> 01:12:46.280
You know, it's so
brave actually.

1619
01:12:52.203 --> 01:12:53.121
[Coraline] I'm exhausted.

1620
01:12:53.204 --> 01:12:54.455
Yeah, me too.

1621
01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:57.166
I got to stay up
a few more hours

1622
01:12:57.250 --> 01:12:58.501
reading these books for...

1623
01:12:58.584 --> 01:13:00.545
[water splashing]

1624
01:13:10.304 --> 01:13:11.347
Hey.

1625
01:13:12.431 --> 01:13:13.432
Hey.

1626
01:13:14.851 --> 01:13:16.352
Hey. Hey!

1627
01:13:17.603 --> 01:13:19.647
[Cliff] Bro. Oh, shit.

1628
01:13:19.730 --> 01:13:20.731
What are you doing here?

1629
01:13:21.858 --> 01:13:23.460
- What am I doing here?
- What are you doing here?

1630
01:13:23.484 --> 01:13:24.545
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

1631
01:13:24.569 --> 01:13:25.444
Why are you in town?

1632
01:13:25.528 --> 01:13:27.113
I came to see our mother.

1633
01:13:27.196 --> 01:13:29.365
Ain't that what you been
calling me about for weeks now?

1634
01:13:29.448 --> 01:13:30.449
[Cliff breathing heavily]

1635
01:13:31.868 --> 01:13:32.886
What happened to your eye?

1636
01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:35.288
- I got into a fight.
- Yeah.

1637
01:13:35.371 --> 01:13:36.831
Well, get out of the pool.

1638
01:13:36.914 --> 01:13:38.267
- You're making a mess.
- I don't want

1639
01:13:38.291 --> 01:13:40.011
to get out of the pool.
I'm a grown-ass man.

1640
01:13:40.042 --> 01:13:41.169
This your girlfriend?

1641
01:13:41.252 --> 01:13:43.129
Yeah, you scared
the shit out of her.

1642
01:13:43.212 --> 01:13:44.839
I'm Coraline.

1643
01:13:45.756 --> 01:13:47.008
Hi, Coraline.

1644
01:13:47.091 --> 01:13:48.384
At least she's not white again.

1645
01:13:48.467 --> 01:13:50.511
- [Coraline chuckles]
- Your wife was white.

1646
01:13:50.595 --> 01:13:52.346
My wife was a beard.
Beards don't count.

1647
01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:53.306
Well, get out.

1648
01:13:53.389 --> 01:13:54.807
You fucking menace.

1649
01:13:54.891 --> 01:13:55.975
You'll wake the neighbors.

1650
01:13:56.184 --> 01:13:57.059
[Cliff] You know,
fuck your neighbors!

1651
01:13:57.143 --> 01:13:58.728
And fuck your clean pool!

1652
01:13:58.811 --> 01:14:01.314
It's all just a part of your
superiority complex, anyway.

1653
01:14:01.397 --> 01:14:03.107
- [Cliff shouts]
- [Monk] Fucking asshole.

1654
01:14:05.818 --> 01:14:09.530
- [Cliff and Coraline laughing]
- You are a goddamn child!

1655
01:14:10.907 --> 01:14:12.347
It's probably a bad
time to tell you,

1656
01:14:12.408 --> 01:14:13.492
but I did piss down there.

1657
01:14:13.576 --> 01:14:14.577
Fuck.

01:14:16.913 --> 01:14:18.206
[Monk] Oh, funny, huh?

1660
01:14:18.289 --> 01:14:19.415
[Coraline] I'm sorry, Monk.

1661
01:14:19.498 --> 01:14:20.499
Don't get mad.

1663
01:14:21.792 --> 01:14:23.002
Get out of here.

1664
01:14:24.212 --> 01:14:25.338
You want a piece of me?

[cheerful music playing]

[Cliff laughing]

1667
01:14:30.885 --> 01:14:31.886
It's funny, huh?

1668
01:14:33.471 --> 01:14:35.806
[Cliff] So I'm lying
in bed with him,

1669
01:14:35.890 --> 01:14:38.392
butt-ass naked

1670
01:14:38.476 --> 01:14:41.020
and in walks Claude
carrying the frozen yogurt.

1671
01:14:41.103 --> 01:14:42.813
- No.
- Yeah, I forgot I'd shown him

1672
01:14:42.897 --> 01:14:44.190
where I keep the spare key.

1673
01:14:45.149 --> 01:14:48.194
So he just throws
the yogurt at us

1674
01:14:48.277 --> 01:14:50.655
and then he wallops
me right in the eye.

1675
01:14:52.823 --> 01:14:54.283
What was the other guy doing?

1676
01:14:54.367 --> 01:14:55.826
He couldn't stop laughing.

1677
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:57.721
He said that's what he
does when he gets nervous.

1678
01:14:57.745 --> 01:14:58.913
[Coraline chuckles] Okay.

1679
01:14:58.996 --> 01:15:00.748
You really going
for it these days.

1680
01:15:00.831 --> 01:15:02.583
I only been gay for,
like, five minutes,

1681
01:15:02.667 --> 01:15:03.918
I got to make up for lost time.

1682
01:15:04.001 --> 01:15:05.920
Yeah. Well, good for you.

1683
01:15:06.003 --> 01:15:07.588
I mean, the whole
world's falling apart.

1684
01:15:07.672 --> 01:15:09.090
Might as well have some fun.

1685
01:15:09.173 --> 01:15:10.591
- I appreciate that.
- Yeah.

1686
01:15:11.634 --> 01:15:12.927
You know, you're
quite beautiful.

1687
01:15:14.553 --> 01:15:15.554
Thank you.

1688
01:15:18.224 --> 01:15:19.850
What do you see in my brother?

1689
01:15:21.352 --> 01:15:23.229
- He's funny.
- [Cliff] Mm.

1690
01:15:23.312 --> 01:15:26.148
- He's not funny. No.
- No, not ha-ha funny.

1691
01:15:26.232 --> 01:15:28.859
- Like, sad funny.
- [Cliff] Okay.

1692
01:15:28.943 --> 01:15:30.736
[Coraline] Like a
three-legged dog.

1693
01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:32.947
I see it now. Like
somebody dying on a toilet.

1694
01:15:33.698 --> 01:15:34.949
[Coraline] Exactly.

1695
01:15:35.032 --> 01:15:36.617
- Exactly.
- Invariably,

1696
01:15:36.701 --> 01:15:39.203
- you go too far.
- [Cliff] You think?

1697
01:15:39.287 --> 01:15:40.538
I don't think I go far enough.

1698
01:15:40.621 --> 01:15:41.706
It's becoming hurtful.

1699
01:15:41.789 --> 01:15:43.249
- [Cliff and Coraline] Aw.
- See?

1700
01:15:43.332 --> 01:15:44.393
- See?
- [Cliff as Monk] "You know,"

1701
01:15:44.417 --> 01:15:45.209
- "invariably..."
- [Coraline] Oh.

1702
01:15:45.293 --> 01:15:47.420
"you go too far."

- [Coraline kisses] Yeah.

1704
01:15:49.547 --> 01:15:50.816
- You got a kiss, man.
- [Coraline laughs]

1705
01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:53.551
Look at you. Just
by being pathetic.

1706
01:15:53.634 --> 01:15:54.760
- God bless you.
- Hey.

1707
01:15:54.844 --> 01:15:56.470
- [laughing]
- [Cliff] That is like

1708
01:15:56.554 --> 01:15:58.074
- a three-legged dog.
- [Coraline] Hey.

1709
01:15:59.348 --> 01:16:01.100
[Cliff laughing]

1710
01:16:03.728 --> 01:16:06.314
Oh, this is nice.

1711
01:16:06.397 --> 01:16:07.481
Yeah, it's not bad.

1712
01:16:08.524 --> 01:16:10.026
What do you got there, pergola?

1713
01:16:10.109 --> 01:16:11.110
No, that's a gazebo.

1714
01:16:11.986 --> 01:16:13.070
[Cliff] Same difference.

1715
01:16:13.154 --> 01:16:14.030
- All right?
- [Monk] To the left.

1716
01:16:14.113 --> 01:16:15.156
Oh. Excuse me.

1717
01:16:17.199 --> 01:16:18.200
Huh.

1718
01:16:19.702 --> 01:16:21.537
Hey, Monk?

1719
01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:23.372
How the hell can you
afford this place?

1720
01:16:24.582 --> 01:16:25.583
I, um...

1721
01:16:27.335 --> 01:16:31.213
Well, there was some money
Lisa left for Mother.

1722
01:16:31.297 --> 01:16:32.697
Thought the divorce
cleaned her out.

1723
01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:37.053
Well, I'm not familiar with
what her finances were like,

1724
01:16:37.136 --> 01:16:39.138
but if you're so
interested in the bills,

1725
01:16:39.221 --> 01:16:41.098
perhaps I can start
sending them to you?

1726
01:16:41.182 --> 01:16:42.892
Ah, it's fine. Where we going?

1727
01:16:42.975 --> 01:16:43.976
Right here. 44.

1728
01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:47.313
Surprise!

1729
01:16:51.650 --> 01:16:53.611
We've had a difficult morning.

1730
01:16:57.615 --> 01:16:59.735
We had to sedate her after
she tried to strike a nurse.

1731
01:17:00.493 --> 01:17:02.620
- Has she done that before?
- No.

1732

[record player clicks]

1733
01:17:04.038 --> 01:17:05.558
She has a different
demeanor every day.

1734
01:17:06.165 --> 01:17:07.958
Sometimes every hour.

1735
01:17:08.042 --> 01:17:09.835
But maybe she'll
feel better tomorrow.

1736
01:17:10.711 --> 01:17:12.338
I'm sorry, I need to go.

1737
01:17:12.421 --> 01:17:14.590
Yes, of course. Thank you.

- Sweet, right?
- Yeah, that's great.

1741
01:17:22.765 --> 01:17:24.350
How can you afford this place?

01:17:24.975 --> 01:17:26.185

a drug dealer or
something, are you?

No, I'm a writer.

not my bookkeeper.

[Wilson] <i>Yeah, it's just one more.</i> And from
the looks of it, it should be a quick read.

1926
01:26:40.781 --> 01:26:41.865
A quick fuck. [Chuckles]

1932
01:27:23.407 --> 01:27:24.658
Hi, Monkie.

1933
01:27:26.868 --> 01:27:27.953
You look beautiful.

1934

1935
01:27:43.051 --> 01:27:45.012
Oh, hello.

1936
01:27:45.095 --> 01:27:47.931
Monkie, do we know these men?

1937
01:27:48.015 --> 01:27:50.183
No, Mother, this
isn't the Alzheimer's,

1938
01:27:50.267 --> 01:27:52.394
these are actual strangers.
Who are you people?

1939
01:27:52.477 --> 01:27:54.021
We're Cliff's friends.

1940
01:27:54.104 --> 01:27:55.605
Of course, you are.

1941
01:27:55.689 --> 01:27:57.667
We met him a few days ago.
I'm Kenny, this is Alvin.

1942
01:27:57.691 --> 01:27:58.692
Are you Monk?

1943
01:27:58.775 --> 01:28:00.861
I am. How did you know?

1944
01:28:00.944 --> 01:28:03.739
Oh. Well, Cliff said
Monk's a real tight-ass.

1945
01:28:05.657 --> 01:28:06.825
Did he?

1946
01:28:06.908 --> 01:28:07.909
Delightful.

1947
01:28:08.577 --> 01:28:09.995
Mother, you sit here.

1948
01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:12.581
Lorraine?

1949
01:28:18.253 --> 01:28:19.480
[Alvin] Do you like
scrambled eggs?

1950
01:28:19.504 --> 01:28:21.006
[Kenny] I love scrambled eggs.

1951
01:28:21.089 --> 01:28:22.424
What the hell are
you doing here?

1952
01:28:22.507 --> 01:28:23.508
You first.

1953
01:28:26.178 --> 01:28:28.513
Oh, shit, the wedding.

1954
01:28:28.597 --> 01:28:30.098
- Ah.
- [Cliff] Oh, fuck!

1955
01:28:31.975 --> 01:28:33.310
I didn't go to the airport.

1956
01:28:33.393 --> 01:28:36.563
That day I left, I needed
some time to myself.

1957
01:28:36.646 --> 01:28:39.357
Time to oneself implies
by definition, time alone.

1958
01:28:39.441 --> 01:28:40.901
Oh, Christ, here we go.

1959
01:28:40.984 --> 01:28:43.236

- [Lorraine] Ah!

1960
01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:44.321
Mr. Cliff.

1961
01:28:44.404 --> 01:28:45.644
I'm sorry, guys, I'll handle it.

1962
01:28:45.697 --> 01:28:47.699
You need to leave.

1963
01:28:47.783 --> 01:28:49.367
Don't bother to
clean up, just go.

1964
01:28:49.451 --> 01:28:51.119
Oh, no, it's all right, just...

1965
01:28:51.203 --> 01:28:52.245
Please stay.

1966
01:28:52.329 --> 01:28:53.789
It's a celebration.

1967
01:28:55.457 --> 01:28:56.666
It's good to see you, Cliff.

1968
01:28:57.918 --> 01:28:59.920
It's good to see
you too, Maynard.

1969
01:29:00.003 --> 01:29:01.463
I, um...

1970
01:29:01.546 --> 01:29:02.839
I... I don't want to impose.

1971
01:29:02.923 --> 01:29:04.174
You can't impose.

1972
01:29:05.258 --> 01:29:06.259
You're family.

1973

[music playing softly]

1974
01:29:21.525 --> 01:29:22.526
Okay.

1975
01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:24.903
I'll, uh...

1976
01:29:24.986 --> 01:29:26.196
I'll go clean up a bit, yeah?

1977
01:29:27.948 --> 01:29:29.741
Congratulations, you guys.

1978
01:29:35.247 --> 01:29:36.706
Can we make y'all
some breakfast?

1979
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:38.500
I can whip up a killer smoothie

1980
01:29:38.583 --> 01:29:40.311
and Alvin used to work the
omelet station on a cruise ship.

1981
01:29:40.335 --> 01:29:43.046
[Lorraine] That sounds
lovely. Thank you.

1982
01:29:47.884 --> 01:29:49.278
It's very kind of
you to let them stay.

1983
01:29:49.302 --> 01:29:50.302
Oh.

1984
01:29:50.345 --> 01:29:51.721
It's always easier dealing

1985
01:29:51.805 --> 01:29:53.723
with other people's
families than your own.

1986
01:29:53.807 --> 01:29:55.142
[Monk chuckles]

1987
01:29:55.225 --> 01:29:58.019
I regret to inform you
that in a couple hours,

1988
01:29:58.103 --> 01:29:59.563

Look how that turned out.

2017
01:32:17.534 --> 01:32:18.785
I find myself

2018

These days?

I've been thinking
a lot lately about

2021
01:32:32.841 --> 01:32:34.801
how Dad died not
knowing I'm gay.

2022
01:32:38.096 --> 01:32:40.098
- I think he suspected it.
- Mm.

2023
01:32:41.308 --> 01:32:42.309
He may have.

2024
01:32:43.184 --> 01:32:44.561
But he didn't know for sure.

2025
01:32:45.979 --> 01:32:48.606
He never knew the
entirety of me.

2026
01:32:50.025 --> 01:32:51.026
And now he never will.

2027
01:32:52.861 --> 01:32:54.612
And that makes me...

2028
01:32:55.739 --> 01:32:57.032
It makes me real sad.

2029
01:33:00.368 --> 01:33:03.163
Well, what if he had
known and rejected you?

2030
01:33:03.246 --> 01:33:05.915
At least he'd be
rejecting the real me.

2031

I know that sounds crazy,

2032
01:33:11.588 --> 01:33:13.131

relief in that.

2033
01:33:16.468 --> 01:33:18.386
It doesn't sound so crazy.

they want to love you.

2038

You should let them

[Daniel] It was dog shit.

[Ailene] Personally,
I adored it.

2047

It was like gazing
into an open wound.

2048
01:34:35.588 --> 01:34:37.006
I agree.

2049
01:34:37.090 --> 01:34:39.259
I think it's the strongest

much more than I was expecting.

2055
01:34:51.146 --> 01:34:53.815
I mean, this is a
gutsy piece of work.

2056
01:34:53.898 --> 01:34:55.859
And necessary for the times.

2057
01:34:56.860 --> 01:34:58.278
What did you think, Sintara?

2058
01:34:59.821 --> 01:35:03.032
I found it to be pretty
pandering, actually.

2059
01:35:03.116 --> 01:35:04.117
You did?

2060
01:35:04.951 --> 01:35:06.369
Yes. Did you not?

2061
01:35:07.078 --> 01:35:08.496
I very much did.

2062
01:35:08.580 --> 01:35:12.000
I thought it was
simplistic and meaningless.

2063
01:35:12.083 --> 01:35:14.127
Well, of course,
it was simplistic.

2064
01:35:14.210 --> 01:35:17.213
I mean, it's the
language of the gutter.

2065
01:35:17.297 --> 01:35:19.799
You know, not some
prissy graduate thesis.

you find pandering?

Oh, uh...

2085
01:36:36.918 --> 01:36:39.128
I can't really put
my finger on it, but

2086
01:36:40.755 --> 01:36:42.675
it's not different from
some of what's out there,

2087

I'm going to use.

2090
01:36:49.806 --> 01:36:51.015
You said you agreed, right?

2091
01:36:51.099 --> 01:36:52.892
Yeah, I do. I think
it seems written

2092
01:36:52.976 --> 01:36:56.104
to satisfy the tastes of
guilt-ridden white people.

2093
01:36:56.187 --> 01:36:58.565
Yeah, the kind of book
critics call important

2094
01:36:58.648 --> 01:37:00.358
and necessary, but
not well-written.

2095
01:37:00.441 --> 01:37:01.943
- [both chuckle]
- [Monk] Exactly.

2096
01:37:06.239 --> 01:37:10.451
Okay, so... And please
don't take offense at this,

2097

01:37:13.246 --> 01:37:15.665
so very different
from your book?

2099
01:37:19.544 --> 01:37:21.629
Is that what this is about?

2100
01:37:21.713 --> 01:37:23.274
- You think my book's trash?
- [Monk] No.

2101
01:37:23.298 --> 01:37:27.176
To be honest, I
haven't read your book.

2102
01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:29.053
I've read excerpts

2103
01:37:29.137 --> 01:37:32.724
and it didn't seem
so dissimilar.

2104
01:37:34.684 --> 01:37:37.604
I did a lot of
research for my book.

2105
01:37:37.687 --> 01:37:39.939
Some of it was actually
taken from real interviews.

2106
01:37:40.773 --> 01:37:42.066
Maybe you've been up

2107
01:37:42.150 --> 01:37:44.193
in your ivory tower of
academia for so long

2108
01:37:44.277 --> 01:37:46.446
you've forgotten that some
people's lives are hard.

2109
01:37:46.529 --> 01:37:47.572
Your life?

2110
01:37:50.074 --> 01:37:52.660
You went to an exclusive
bohemian college.

2111
01:37:52.744 --> 01:37:54.829
You had a job at a fancy

2112
01:37:54.912 --> 01:37:56.581
publishing house in New York.

2113
01:37:56.664 --> 01:37:59.459
So what? I don't need
to write about my life.

2114
01:37:59.542 --> 01:38:01.002
I write about what
interests people.

2115
01:38:02.337 --> 01:38:04.464
You write what interests
white publishers

2116
01:38:04.547 --> 01:38:07.216
fiending Black trauma porn.

2117
01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:08.968
They're the one buying
the manuscripts.

2118
01:38:10.386 --> 01:38:12.513
Is it bad to cater
to their tastes?

2119
01:38:12.597 --> 01:38:14.557
If you're okay feeding

2120
01:38:14.641 --> 01:38:16.100
people's base
desires for profit...

2121
01:38:16.184 --> 01:38:18.144
I'm okay with giving the
market what it wants.

2122
01:38:18.227 --> 01:38:19.867
That's how drug dealers
excuse themselves.

2123
01:38:19.896 --> 01:38:21.439
And I think drugs
should be legal.

2124
01:38:26.152 --> 01:38:29.155
But you're not fed up with it?

2125
01:38:29.238 --> 01:38:31.532
You know, Black
people in poverty?

2126
01:38:32.617 --> 01:38:34.035
Black people rapping?

2127
01:38:34.118 --> 01:38:35.495
Black people as slaves?

2128
01:38:35.578 --> 01:38:37.872
Black people murdered
by the police?

2129
01:38:37.955 --> 01:38:39.016
Old soaring narratives about...

2130
01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:40.166
[Sintara] Okay.

2131
01:38:40.249 --> 01:38:42.126
Black folks in
dire circumstances

2132
01:38:42.210 --> 01:38:45.046
who still managed to maintain
their dignity before they die?

2133
01:38:45.129 --> 01:38:47.715
I mean, I'm not saying
these things aren't real,

2134
01:38:47.799 --> 01:38:50.927
but we're also more than this.

2135
01:38:51.010 --> 01:38:54.013
And it's like so many writers
like you can't envision us

2136
01:38:54.097 --> 01:38:56.307
without some white
boot on our necks.

2137
01:38:56.391 --> 01:38:59.102
Do you get angry at
Bret Easton Ellis

2138
01:38:59.185 --> 01:39:00.561
or Charles Bukowski

2139
01:39:00.645 --> 01:39:02.313
for writing about
the downtrodden?

2140
01:39:02.397 --> 01:39:04.565
Or is your ire strictly
reserved for Black women?

2141
01:39:04.649 --> 01:39:06.484
Nobody reads Bukowski thinking

2142
01:39:06.567 --> 01:39:08.403
his is the definitive
white experience.

2143
01:39:08.486 --> 01:39:10.321
But people, white people,

2144
01:39:10.405 --> 01:39:12.573
read your book and
confine us to it.

2145
01:39:12.657 --> 01:39:14.909
They think that
we're all like that.

2146
01:39:14.992 --> 01:39:16.661
Then it sounds like your issue

2147
01:39:16.744 --> 01:39:18.746
is with white
people, Monk, not me.

2148
01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:20.498
Well, maybe, but I also think

2149
01:39:20.581 --> 01:39:22.166
that I see the
unrealized potential

2150
01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:23.490
of Black people in this country.

2151
01:39:26.713 --> 01:39:29.340
Potential is what people
see when they think

2152
01:39:29.424 --> 01:39:31.175
what's in front of
them isn't good enough.

2153
01:39:34.095 --> 01:39:35.388
[door opens]

2154
01:39:36.723 --> 01:39:37.724
[Sintara clears throat]

2155
01:39:39.642 --> 01:39:40.935
[door closes]

2156
01:39:41.018 --> 01:39:43.187
So, what are we talking about?

2157
01:39:44.313 --> 01:39:46.274
[mellow music playing]

2158
01:40:08.421 --> 01:40:09.422
[cell phone chimes]

2159
01:40:32.153 --> 01:40:33.255
[Ailene] We're starting again.

2160
01:40:33.279 --> 01:40:34.405
I'll be right there.

2161
01:40:46.083 --> 01:40:48.377
Hey, can I speak to
Arthur? Yeah, it's Monk.

2162
01:40:51.422 --> 01:40:52.422
Hey.

2163
01:40:52.465 --> 01:40:53.883
I'm fine.

2164
01:40:53.966 --> 01:40:55.718
Listen, you think you can set up

2165
01:40:55.802 --> 01:40:57.094
another meeting with Wiley?

2166
01:40:58.179 --> 01:41:00.056
I've got a new idea for him.

2167
01:41:00.139 --> 01:41:01.933
Different kind of movie.

2168
01:41:02.016 --> 01:41:03.017
Thanks.

2169
01:41:17.365 --> 01:41:19.075
I think it's <i>Fuck</i> for me.

2170
01:41:19.158 --> 01:41:20.910
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah, I agree.

2171
01:41:20.993 --> 01:41:22.829
I disagree. I'm sorry.

2172
01:41:22.912 --> 01:41:25.206
I think it would be a mistake

2173
01:41:25.289 --> 01:41:27.708
to award this book anything.

2174
01:41:27.792 --> 01:41:29.335
Well, it's two
versus three, so...

2175
01:41:30.461 --> 01:41:31.462
<i>Fuck's</i> the winner.

2176
01:41:31.546 --> 01:41:32.964
[Ailene] <i>Fuck</i> is the winner.

2177
01:41:36.384 --> 01:41:38.928
You know, it's not just
that it's so affecting,

2178
01:41:40.054 --> 01:41:41.681
I just think it's essential

2179
01:41:41.764 --> 01:41:43.307
to listen to Black
voices right now.

2180
01:41:51.649 --> 01:41:52.650
[Monk] Mother.

2181
01:41:54.068 --> 01:41:55.069
Did you...

2182
01:41:58.489 --> 01:42:00.575
Did you know that Dad
was cheating on you?

2183
01:42:01.784 --> 01:42:04.120
He was bad at keeping secrets.

2184
01:42:04.203 --> 01:42:06.581
Why didn't you leave him?

2185
01:42:06.664 --> 01:42:09.208
He would've been even
more lonely without me.

2186
01:42:12.003 --> 01:42:13.254
You thought he was lonely?

2187
01:42:13.337 --> 01:42:15.214
You father was a genius.

2188
01:42:18.009 --> 01:42:20.970
Geniuses are lonely

2189
01:42:22.346 --> 01:42:25.808
because they can't connect
with the rest of us.

2190
01:42:27.894 --> 01:42:29.395
You're a genius, son.

2191
01:42:31.898 --> 01:42:34.400
Well, I certainly don't
feel like one half the time.

2192
01:42:35.735 --> 01:42:37.004
That's because
you've always been

2193
01:42:37.028 --> 01:42:38.905
so hard on yourself, Cliffy.

2194
01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:49.874
[Carl] And now for the
final award for the evening.

2195
01:42:49.957 --> 01:42:53.461
I promise to leave you alone,
let you eat after this.

2196
01:42:53.544 --> 01:42:55.046
But before I
announce the winner,

2197
01:42:55.129 --> 01:42:56.756
I would like to
acknowledge our judges,

2198
01:42:56.839 --> 01:42:58.799
our incredibly diverse
group of judges

2199
01:42:58.883 --> 01:43:00.968
who've sacrificed valuable time,

2200
01:43:01.052 --> 01:43:02.678
so we could all
celebrate here tonight.

2201
01:43:02.762 --> 01:43:03.822
So if you put your
hands together,

2202
01:43:03.846 --> 01:43:05.348
they did a fantastic job.

2203
01:43:10.394 --> 01:43:11.395
Okay.

2204
01:43:12.104 --> 01:43:13.272
Without further ado,

2205
01:43:14.607 --> 01:43:17.151
this year's Literary
Award goes to...

2206
01:43:18.361 --> 01:43:19.654
Oh, I knew it.

2207
01:43:19.737 --> 01:43:22.156
By Stagg R. Leigh, <i>Fuck.</i>

2208
01:43:22.239 --> 01:43:24.659
[crowd applauding and muttering]

2209
01:43:33.459 --> 01:43:35.795
Well, I'm not sure if
Mr. Leigh is going to grace us

2210
01:43:35.878 --> 01:43:37.338
with his presence here tonight.

2211
01:43:37.421 --> 01:43:40.132
He's notoriously
cagey about attention.

2212
01:43:51.394 --> 01:43:53.062
Oh, hold on.

2213
01:43:53.145 --> 01:43:55.773
Oh, okay. I see some business.

2214
01:43:55.856 --> 01:43:59.652
Someone's coming. Oh,
Thelonious Ellison.

2215
01:43:59.735 --> 01:44:01.570
One of our esteemed judges.

2216
01:44:04.615 --> 01:44:06.450
Weirdly walking
toward the stage.

2217
01:44:08.119 --> 01:44:09.704
No idea why.

2218
01:44:10.496 --> 01:44:11.372
Hey.

2219
01:44:11.455 --> 01:44:12.540
What's going on?

2220
01:44:14.208 --> 01:44:15.209
[Monk] Excuse me.

2221
01:44:16.544 --> 01:44:18.004
Excuse me.

2222
01:44:20.131 --> 01:44:22.091
[suspenseful music playing]

2223
01:44:34.311 --> 01:44:36.022
I have a confession to make.

2224
01:44:41.402 --> 01:44:43.279
[Wiley] <i>Wait, wait,
wait. Smash to black?</i>

2225
01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:45.698
[bell rings]

2226
01:44:45.781 --> 01:44:47.408
No fucking way, dude.

2227
01:44:47.491 --> 01:44:48.951
What's wrong with that?

2228
01:44:49.035 --> 01:44:51.579
There's no resolution here.
What's he going to say?

2229
01:44:51.662 --> 01:44:53.598
I don't know. I think that's
what's interesting about it.

2230
01:44:53.622 --> 01:44:54.742
No, he should say something.

2231
01:44:54.790 --> 01:44:56.208
What did you say?

2232
01:44:56.292 --> 01:44:58.461
Nothing. I walked
out of the ceremony.

2233
01:44:58.544 --> 01:44:59.771
The next day I called you to say

2234
01:44:59.795 --> 01:45:01.172
I wanted to write this movie.

2235
01:45:01.255 --> 01:45:02.548
[Wiley] Well,
Monk, the character

2236
01:45:02.631 --> 01:45:03.924
should say something.

2237
01:45:04.008 --> 01:45:06.010
[Monk] Well, I don't
want him to make some

2238
01:45:06.093 --> 01:45:08.179
grandiose speech
spoon-feeding everyone

2239
01:45:08.262 --> 01:45:09.555
the moral of the story.

2240
01:45:09.638 --> 01:45:11.640
There is no moral.
That's the idea.

2241
01:45:11.724 --> 01:45:12.975
I like the ambiguity.

2242
01:45:13.059 --> 01:45:15.144
Okay, look. You're
a good writer,

2243
01:45:15.227 --> 01:45:17.354
and this is almost there.

2244
01:45:17.438 --> 01:45:19.565
But novels aren't movies, okay?

2245
01:45:19.648 --> 01:45:21.609
Nuance doesn't put
asses in theater seats.

2246
01:45:21.692 --> 01:45:23.152
We need a big
finish. What is this?

2247
01:45:24.278 --> 01:45:26.572
It's the seltzer you asked for.

2248
01:45:26.655 --> 01:45:27.740
Why is it all wet?

2249
01:45:29.241 --> 01:45:30.576
Condensation?

2250
01:45:30.659 --> 01:45:32.328
Condensation. Okay.

2251
01:45:32.411 --> 01:45:34.121
You're a fucking weatherman now.

2252
01:45:34.205 --> 01:45:35.289
You want anything?

2253
01:45:35.372 --> 01:45:36.832
Uh, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

2254
01:45:36.916 --> 01:45:38.042
All right. This is Monk.

2255
01:45:38.125 --> 01:45:41.021
- We're going to make a movie with him if he can get the third act right.
- Nice meeting you.

2256
01:45:41.045 --> 01:45:42.485
- You as well.
- Get me a flat white.

2257
01:45:43.005 --> 01:45:44.840
And, hey, never again.

2258
01:45:47.051 --> 01:45:48.594
All right.

2259
01:45:48.677 --> 01:45:50.797
What other endings you got
in that big brain of yours?

2260
01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:55.267
How about if...

2261
01:45:55.351 --> 01:45:57.812
This year's Literary
Award goes to

2262
01:45:58.729 --> 01:46:01.190
by Stagg R. Leigh, <i>Fuck.</i>

2264

[crowd applauding]

[captivating music continues]

2266
01:46:52.199 --> 01:46:53.951
I'd like to apologize.

2267
01:46:56.537 --> 01:46:58.414
I haven't been myself lately.

2268
01:47:20.019 --> 01:47:21.020
What about that?

2269
01:47:21.770 --> 01:47:22.813
Will she forgive him?

2270
01:47:24.315 --> 01:47:26.108
I don't know.

2271
01:47:26.192 --> 01:47:29.278
The real Coraline won't
return my phone calls.

2272
01:47:29.361 --> 01:47:31.447
Maybe the movie Coraline
is more forgiving.

2273
01:47:34.783 --> 01:47:36.577
No. It's too pat.

2274
01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:38.430
Makes the whole thing feel
like a romantic comedy.

2275
01:47:38.454 --> 01:47:40.122
We don't want to make
a romantic comedy.

2276
01:47:40.206 --> 01:47:41.707
We want to make something real.

2277
01:47:42.833 --> 01:47:43.834
Give me something real.

2278
01:47:48.672 --> 01:47:49.798
I mean, we could just...

2279
01:47:51.091 --> 01:47:52.593
Hey, what's going on?

2280
01:47:53.469 --> 01:47:54.470
[Monk] Excuse me.

2281
01:47:56.847 --> 01:47:57.848
Beat it.

2282
01:48:04.271 --> 01:48:06.232
[suspenseful music playing]

2283
01:48:10.236 --> 01:48:13.280
I have a confession to make.

2284
01:48:13.364 --> 01:48:15.407
[door opens] - Stagg
Leigh, on the ground now!

2285
01:48:15.491 --> 01:48:17.159
[officer 1] There he is!

2286
01:48:17.243 --> 01:48:19.078
[Monk] No, no. I'm
not Stagg Leigh.

2287
01:48:20.246 --> 01:48:21.247
He doesn't exist.

2288
01:48:21.330 --> 01:48:23.415
I'm Monk. Thelonious Ellison.

2289
01:48:23.499 --> 01:48:25.542
You're a fugitive!
On the ground now!

2290
01:48:25.626 --> 01:48:26.794
[Monk] No, no, no.

2291
01:48:26.877 --> 01:48:28.254
That was all a
marketing gimmick.

2292
01:48:28.337 --> 01:48:30.232
- It was all a lie.
- [officer 2] He's got a gun!

2293
01:48:30.256 --> 01:48:31.632
No, no! No, no!

2294
01:48:32.633 --> 01:48:34.551
[dramatic choral music playing]

2295
01:48:51.151 --> 01:48:54.488
[music crescendoes]

2296
01:49:04.081 --> 01:49:05.082
[Wiley] He's dead?

2297
01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:07.501
They smoke him?

2298
01:49:11.714 --> 01:49:12.715
It's perfect.

2299
01:49:14.466 --> 01:49:16.176
Yes! That is...

2300
01:49:17.428 --> 01:49:19.013
That is perfect.

2301
01:49:20.139 --> 01:49:22.224
Time to pick out
your tux, my brother.

2302
01:49:22.308 --> 01:49:23.892
We're going to the big show.

2303
01:49:23.976 --> 01:49:26.186
Hey, come transcribe
this. We got it.

2304
01:49:29.648 --> 01:49:30.649
Fuck.

2305
01:49:30.733 --> 01:49:32.693
[blues music playing]

2306
01:49:53.756 --> 01:49:54.757
[Cliff] Hey.

2307
01:49:57.718 --> 01:49:58.719
[Monk exhales]

2308
01:49:59.428 --> 01:50:00.429
So?

2309
01:50:02.348 --> 01:50:03.828
They going to make
your movie or what?

2310
01:50:04.183 --> 01:50:05.768
Unfortunately, yes.

2311
01:50:05.851 --> 01:50:07.853
Hey! You know what?

2312
01:50:07.936 --> 01:50:10.731
Good luck finding someone
handsome enough to play me.

2313
01:50:10.814 --> 01:50:12.149
I think they have.

2314
01:50:12.232 --> 01:50:13.233
Who they got?

2315
01:50:14.234 --> 01:50:15.235
Tyler Perry.

2316
01:50:15.319 --> 01:50:17.988
[both laughing]

2317
01:50:18.072 --> 01:50:19.073
You got me. That's good.

2318
01:50:21.283 --> 01:50:22.576
[engine starts]

2319
01:50:24.411 --> 01:50:25.537
[Cliff] All right.

2320
01:50:28.374 --> 01:50:30.334
[blues music continues]

2321
01:51:39.695 --> 01:51:41.655
