1
00:02:00,248 --> 00:02:02,080
Well...

2
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,998
...boys!

3
00:02:22,915 --> 00:02:25,539
Maurice, catch!

4
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,582
Quite a spark, Maurice!

5
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,290
Oh!
Whoo!

6
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:59,375
<i>...When the day is dawning</i>

7
00:02:59,418 --> 00:03:02,667
<i>And all through
the wibbly wobbly walk</i>

8
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,001
<i>they get a wibbly wobbly
feeling in the morning.</i>

9
00:03:06,043 --> 00:03:10,251
<i>They all walk
the wibbly wobbly walk</i>

10
00:03:10,293 --> 00:03:15,126
<i>all talk
the wibbly wobbly talk</i>

11
00:03:15,168 --> 00:03:17,335
<i>all wear
the wibbly wobbly ties</i>

12
00:03:17,378 --> 00:03:20,502
<i>and wink at all the pretty girls
with wibbly wobbly eyes.</i>

13
00:03:20,544 --> 00:03:23,293
<i>Oh, they all smile
the wibbly wobbly...</i>

14
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,127
Hey, how about
over there, look?

15
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:27,085
God's sake, Viv!

16
00:03:27,586 --> 00:03:30,793
For God's sake, Viv!
It's not funny!

17
00:04:26,548 --> 00:04:30,131
Exactly how long have
Tom and Viv been courting?

18
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:33,756
Oh, minutes.
Absolute minutes.

19
00:04:35,465 --> 00:04:36,922
Really?

20
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:43,840
You can't really want
to go back to America.

21
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,965
What would you do?

22
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:51,132
Most likely become a professor.

23
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:55,382
Write learned papers on
obscure philosophers.

24
00:04:56,841 --> 00:05:01,049
I don't know... melt into the
stones of Harvard, I suppose.

25
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,508
No Doris,
he's my fancy man.

26
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,049
Whatever 'e chooses
is all right by me.

27
00:05:22,593 --> 00:05:26,009
- I suppose he is quite safe,
this Eliot chap. - Safe?

28
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:29,800
I can't imagine what you mean.
Tom is a brilliant scholar.

29
00:05:31,636 --> 00:05:33,260
Rather Viv's type then.

30
00:05:53,428 --> 00:05:56,552
I never want to
see the States again.

31
00:05:56,595 --> 00:06:00,136
I want to live in Europe
and write poetry.

32
00:06:00,845 --> 00:06:02,719
I love you.

33
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,636
I love you more than life itself.

34
00:06:04,678 --> 00:06:06,887
- I'd do anything for you.
- Oh, dear.

35
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:08,262
What?

36
00:06:09,263 --> 00:06:11,345
I know all that.

37
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:13,553
You don't have to be
so wet about things.

38
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:15,553
I'm sorry.

39
00:06:16,471 --> 00:06:18,512
It's all right, Tom.

40
00:06:20,763 --> 00:06:22,596
It's perfectly all right.

41
00:06:35,555 --> 00:06:38,138
I don't think this is
quite the right place.

42
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,097
It's not that I don't want to.

43
00:06:51,806 --> 00:06:53,722
Are you sure?

44
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,806
It's just that...

45
00:06:59,807 --> 00:07:02,306
when we do...

46
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:04,765
I want it to be perfect.

47
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:07,640
Nothing...

48
00:07:07,682 --> 00:07:10,765
Nothing in the
world must go wrong.

49
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,016
Are you a virgin, Mr. Russell?

50
00:07:17,725 --> 00:07:19,474
Not exactly.

51
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,057
Is Tom, do you suppose?

52
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,724
Very probably.

53
00:07:26,725 --> 00:07:28,432
I am.

54
00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:31,517
Awful thing the dreaded
sex business.

55
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:36,142
- Vivvie's not though.
- Not what?

56
00:07:36,184 --> 00:07:37,642
A virgin.

57
00:07:37,684 --> 00:07:40,683
Forgive me Maurice but,
are you doing a survey of some kind.

58
00:07:41,143 --> 00:07:43,933
- Survey?
- Into sexual habits.

59
00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:45,433
Ah, no.

60
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,476
You see, there was
a spot of bother last year.

61
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,976
Vivvie took rather a shine to a chap,
Mums found out, put a stop to it.

62
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:58,768
Awful scenes, bed without dinner,
house arrest, you know the kind of thing.

63
00:08:00,144 --> 00:08:03,559
- I wouldn't want to go through
all that again, with Tom. - No.

64
00:08:04,561 --> 00:08:07,394
I'm sure Tom's intentions
are entirely honourable.

65
00:08:09,145 --> 00:08:11,310
Not sure about Vivvie's, though.

66
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,185
You can stay in the house.

67
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:22,402
Mum and Dad are away,
there's nobody there except the staff.

68
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:25,786
And the house is absolutely
stuffed with cigarettes,

69
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:28,004
so we can be as
decadent as we like.

70
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:30,436
And the season's coming up.

71
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,270
Ascot, Goodwood,
the Russians at Covent Garden.

72
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,770
But I don't know these places, Viv.

73
00:08:35,812 --> 00:08:38,187
What a wonderful time
I'll have showing you.

74
00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:43,021
But I don't have any clothes.

75
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,979
Cor blimey,
ain't you a bore?

76
00:08:46,605 --> 00:08:48,479
I'll buy you some, you ninny.

77
00:08:48,522 --> 00:08:53,271
Oh, darling, you're going to have to learn
to make an absolute arse of yourself.

78
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:55,672
We're going to get married,
be broke,

79
00:08:55,956 --> 00:08:59,835
we may even starve,
it'll be absolute hell.

80
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,147
But it'll be worth it,
because we have this love.

81
00:09:03,106 --> 00:09:05,022
And nobody else has it.

82
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:10,397
This is my one chance
of happiness, Maurice

83
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:13,273
and I'm taking it
and I'll need the car.

84
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:17,398
Yeah but Mum and Dad are
coming home, they'll kill me.

85
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,148
What am I gonna tell them?

86
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,773
For God's sake Vivvie,
you can't!

87
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:34,065
Oh, God.
You're eloping, aren't you?

88
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:38,482
Well where are you getting married?
What am I gonna tell them?

89
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:42,232
Oh, God. There'll be an
almighty row, I know it.

90
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,566
And I'll get all the blame.

91
00:09:45,609 --> 00:09:48,275
Viv wants it this way, no fuss.

92
00:09:52,901 --> 00:09:54,316
Look, Tom...

93
00:09:57,401 --> 00:10:02,109
There's only one rule in our family.
Sort of unspoken, kind of thing.

94
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:06,442
You have to be kind to Vivvie.

95
00:10:06,485 --> 00:10:10,067
I will be, Maurice.
That I promise you.

96
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,484
No, no.
I mean especially kind.

97
00:10:13,527 --> 00:10:16,609
Careful handling...
"this-side-up" kind of thing.

98
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:24,693
You see, the thing is, you grow up
trying not to notice certain things.

99
00:10:25,653 --> 00:10:28,818
The scenes, the closed doors...

100
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:32,318
A family of mutes...

101
00:10:33,653 --> 00:10:35,944
But Mum's always said
it's not Vivvie's fault.

102
00:10:35,987 --> 00:10:38,403
Not her fault at all and that's right,
she's right, you know.

103
00:10:38,445 --> 00:10:40,278
Maurice, I don't think I follow.

104
00:10:41,112 --> 00:10:42,528
Ah.

105
00:10:44,404 --> 00:10:46,986
Well listen, Tom... man to man...

106
00:10:48,904 --> 00:10:53,112
There isn't anything beastly
between you and Viv, is there?

107
00:10:53,155 --> 00:10:56,237
Nothing in the...
in the medical way.

108
00:10:59,946 --> 00:11:01,070
Oh.

109
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:07,237
I think I can reassure you
on that point, Maurice.

110
00:11:08,113 --> 00:11:10,196
I'm perfectly healthy.

111
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:16,196
- Uh well, perhaps it's all right then.
- I'm sure it is.

112
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:47,823
Oh, I forgot.

113
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:03,991
Won't be long.

114
00:12:09,534 --> 00:12:12,741
If you wouldn't mind hurrying,
my husband's waiting.

115
00:12:12,784 --> 00:12:14,741
Um, yes.

116
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:19,367
The one's anodyne, the other bromide,
Miss Haigh-Wood?

117
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,075
Mrs Thomas Eliot.

118
00:12:27,993 --> 00:12:30,909
You know Mrs Eliot,
you must never mix them?

119
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:33,700
- Yes I quite understand.
- Ma'am...

120
00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:37,785
Excuse me for asking, but this is
what you were recommended, is it?

121
00:12:37,827 --> 00:12:41,076
The anodyne is 60%
spirit of ether

122
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:43,368
and the bromide 90% alcohol.

123
00:12:45,411 --> 00:12:47,868
You think there's
been some mistake?

124
00:12:47,911 --> 00:12:50,743
Sir Frederick Lamb is
the King's personal physician.

125
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:53,452
Oh, no Ma'am, no, I know.

126
00:12:53,495 --> 00:12:55,244
It's just...

127
00:12:56,245 --> 00:12:58,202
You will be careful, won't you?

128
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,494
I will.
Thank you.

129
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,661
- Louise, Ma'am.
- Louise?

130
00:13:32,205 --> 00:13:34,329
What's happened Maurice,
where are they?

131
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:37,288
Is it too late?
Why didn't you stop them?

132
00:13:38,705 --> 00:13:40,329
Who is he?

133
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,667
I'm going out.

134
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:48,042
Will you come?

135
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,626
Forgive me, Tom.

136
00:14:57,127 --> 00:14:59,668
There is nothing to forgive.

137
00:15:03,127 --> 00:15:04,834
Where are you going?

138
00:15:08,086 --> 00:15:10,002
I don't know.

139
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:14,460
Out.

140
00:15:18,753 --> 00:15:21,960
Oh, please Tom,
don't leave me.

141
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:24,711
- Oh, God, Tom, please.
- Vivvie, don't.

142
00:15:24,754 --> 00:15:27,920
I can make you happy,
my darling.

143
00:15:27,962 --> 00:15:30,586
- I can. I can.
- Don't.

144
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:31,920
Oh.

145
00:15:33,296 --> 00:15:35,628
Let me try and
make you happy.

146
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:38,128
No, there is...

147
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,129
There is no need
to say anything.

148
00:15:44,588 --> 00:15:46,504
I disgust you.

149
00:15:54,672 --> 00:15:56,046
Tom...

150
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,213
Do I?

151
00:18:57,891 --> 00:19:01,598
Mr Eliot, I'm terribly sorry,
but I wonder if you could help us.

152
00:19:08,434 --> 00:19:09,849
Mrs Eliot?

153
00:19:14,725 --> 00:19:17,683
Vivvie?
It's me.

154
00:19:23,393 --> 00:19:24,892
Thank you.

155
00:19:40,102 --> 00:19:42,018
Vivvie, why?

156
00:19:43,686 --> 00:19:45,518
Why did you leave me?

157
00:19:58,728 --> 00:20:01,436
I take the pills for my head,
the tummy comes back.

158
00:20:02,895 --> 00:20:06,352
I take the medicines for my stomach,
the headaches come back.

159
00:20:08,062 --> 00:20:10,645
So sometimes I take
them all together.

160
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:14,728
I know I shouldn't, but...

161
00:20:17,646 --> 00:20:21,395
You know, you mustn't
leave me like that.

162
00:20:25,063 --> 00:20:27,145
You must talk to me.

163
00:20:28,355 --> 00:20:30,979
I never know what
you're thinking.

164
00:20:39,522 --> 00:20:44,605
I know I can make things right for you, Tom,
I know I can make you happy.

165
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,814
I promise.

166
00:20:49,773 --> 00:20:52,355
But we have to get
used to each other.

167
00:20:54,815 --> 00:20:56,980
We have to be
kind to each other.

168
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:02,606
Tom...

169
00:21:05,316 --> 00:21:07,315
Darling Tom.

170
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:27,774
- Good morning, Annie.
- Morning Ma'am. Sir.

171
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:36,775
Maurice.

172
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:42,358
Has it been very ghastly,
Maurice?

173
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,775
Totally blistering,
absolute tongue lashing all round.

174
00:21:47,318 --> 00:21:49,025
I think they...

175
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:51,525
They're in the...

176
00:21:54,152 --> 00:21:55,943
I won't excuse
what we've done.

177
00:21:55,985 --> 00:21:59,068
I haven't even told my family
back in the States.

178
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,109
But I can assure you, Vivienne is
my life now, I love her completely.

179
00:22:03,152 --> 00:22:05,901
- Tea?
- Thank you.

180
00:22:05,944 --> 00:22:09,402
I really, sincerely,
did not mean to hurt you.

181
00:22:09,445 --> 00:22:10,944
Lemon?

182
00:22:10,986 --> 00:22:12,485
Uh, please.

183
00:22:12,528 --> 00:22:15,777
Why don't you do something sensible
with that hat and brolly?

184
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:18,319
Yes, of course.

185
00:22:23,778 --> 00:22:24,985
Thank you.

186
00:22:29,237 --> 00:22:31,070
Is Vivienne pregnant?

187
00:22:32,196 --> 00:22:34,653
No.
No she is not.

188
00:22:34,696 --> 00:22:37,778
After her money?
Are you a Johnny-come-lately?

189
00:22:38,654 --> 00:22:40,695
A cad?
A bounder?

190
00:22:40,737 --> 00:22:42,612
No, I don't think so.

191
00:22:42,655 --> 00:22:48,029
- Any money or prospects?
- I have $100 a year from Harvard.

192
00:22:48,072 --> 00:22:50,821
I am...
well, actually, was studying

193
00:22:50,863 --> 00:22:54,237
the philosophy of F.H. Bradley,
I don't know whether you know him...

194
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,321
The very last thing my husband
will want to hear about

195
00:22:57,363 --> 00:22:59,530
is someone else's philosophy.

196
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:04,988
I have published one
small book of poetry.

197
00:23:05,031 --> 00:23:06,238
Got a roof?

198
00:23:06,823 --> 00:23:10,197
A tutor of mine,
the honourable Bertrand Russell

199
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:13,197
has offered us accommodations
in his flat in Soho.

200
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:15,072
It's... small.

201
00:23:15,114 --> 00:23:17,239
In fact it's in the attic...

202
00:23:17,282 --> 00:23:19,989
Bertrand Russell,
the pacifist villain?

203
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:23,031
The one the newspaper wallahs call
the most hated man in London?

204
00:23:23,074 --> 00:23:24,739
That sounds like him, yes.

205
00:23:26,324 --> 00:23:28,781
If I can put your minds at rest,
I recently

206
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:32,823
have received an offer for six
lectures on French symbolism.

207
00:23:32,865 --> 00:23:34,574
So, to be precise...

208
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,949
...you have $2 a week...

209
00:23:37,991 --> 00:23:41,699
...you intend to share an attic with
the most hated man in London...

210
00:23:41,741 --> 00:23:45,282
and you might be giving a few lectures
on French percussion instruments.

211
00:23:45,866 --> 00:23:49,824
In the meantime, the whole of
Europe is at war with the Kaiser.

212
00:23:50,992 --> 00:23:53,533
Nothing could make
me feel more secure.

213
00:24:05,451 --> 00:24:07,617
How was the wedding?

214
00:24:09,243 --> 00:24:12,127
Of course, Eastbourne's
proudest boast is that

215
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,162
you won't find one shop
window on the front.

216
00:24:15,197 --> 00:24:18,992
It reminded me of
Forest Park in St. Louis.

217
00:24:19,035 --> 00:24:21,076
Did it really?

218
00:24:21,785 --> 00:24:25,035
- Was the weather kind?
- Very bracing.

219
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:28,077
Had you a sunny room?

220
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:30,785
Hardly had time
inside to find out.

221
00:24:30,828 --> 00:24:32,493
Ho-ho, bliss.

222
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:43,828
"Dear Mrs Haigh-Wood, thank you for your
cheque to cover the damage to room 86.

223
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:47,994
Throughout this whole episode I
may say that Mr Eliot behaved

224
00:24:48,037 --> 00:24:51,078
with considerable forbearance. "

225
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,704
Before Vivienne rushed you headlong
into this, did she tell you anything?

226
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,079
Nothing?

227
00:25:03,455 --> 00:25:05,079
Nothing at all?

228
00:25:11,913 --> 00:25:14,913
I really am rather proud of you.

229
00:25:14,956 --> 00:25:19,663
I don't condone anything, but all in
all I feel you've behaved very well.

230
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:24,580
And you are discrete,
I sense that.

231
00:25:27,872 --> 00:25:33,372
Yes, I think you're going to make
a wonderful member of the family.

232
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:04,582
Bertie Russell says
that war is a crime.

233
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,083
He says that killing in uniform
is merely licensed murder.

234
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:13,124
Oh, thanks very much.

235
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:19,583
What do you think, Tom?

236
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:22,417
Not at the dinner
table please, Vivienne.

237
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,459
Of course.

238
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:29,631
Millions of young men
are going to die and it

239
00:26:29,674 --> 00:26:32,092
mustn't interfere with
the cream of broccoli.

240
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:33,625
Good lord, is that what it is?

241
00:26:48,961 --> 00:26:51,793
Bertie Russell says
war must be abolished.

242
00:26:52,752 --> 00:26:54,960
Bertie's Tom's friend.

243
00:26:55,002 --> 00:26:57,169
He paid for all
my dance lessons.

244
00:27:02,128 --> 00:27:04,752
Your friend wants to go to bed with me,
did you know that, Tom?

245
00:27:04,795 --> 00:27:06,377
He seems keen,
even if you're not.

246
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,586
That's enough.

247
00:27:12,253 --> 00:27:14,170
You should tell him
what it would be like.

248
00:27:15,129 --> 00:27:19,545
These are my men, Tom and Bertie.
But they can't always communicate.

249
00:27:19,588 --> 00:27:21,545
I unlock their minds!

250
00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:27,253
Could you hear yourself shouting
in there, could you?

251
00:27:28,463 --> 00:27:31,463
Now... very calm.

252
00:27:33,547 --> 00:27:35,546
Very still.

253
00:27:40,005 --> 00:27:41,921
Have you taken your medicine?

254
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:45,921
How often is Granny visiting you?

255
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,547
- I thought Granny was dead.
- Very well then.

256
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:51,172
How often do you
get the curse?

257
00:27:52,131 --> 00:27:54,630
- Two or three times.
- In a month?

258
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,172
Sometimes in a week.

259
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,131
Tom's not quite what I
imagined a poet to be.

260
00:28:08,216 --> 00:28:11,090
- Was he a virgin?
- He most certainly was!

261
00:28:11,132 --> 00:28:14,465
It can't be easy
for a new husband.

262
00:28:15,424 --> 00:28:16,673
No.

263
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:20,507
Have you enough ST's?

264
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,882
Yes Mummy, I have enough sanitary
towels to make a patchwork quilt.

265
00:28:23,925 --> 00:28:27,257
- In two colours.
- Please Vivienne, try not to be vulgar.

266
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,632
There is never any occasion for it.

267
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:31,882
Life is quite vile
enough as it is.

268
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,216
Oh, it's all right, Mummy.

269
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:40,925
You don't have to
worry anymore.

270
00:28:40,968 --> 00:28:44,550
Because whatever else happens,
I've got Tom.

271
00:28:45,468 --> 00:28:47,092
He's mine.

272
00:28:51,551 --> 00:28:54,050
And you can't stop it now.

273
00:28:55,052 --> 00:28:59,968
"You see here on the sill is a boot mark,
a heavy boot with broad metal heel...

274
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:03,843
...and beside it is the
mark of the timber-toe. "

275
00:29:03,885 --> 00:29:08,968
Ah, a wooden-legged
man of course...

276
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,385
There's always a
wooden-legged man!

277
00:29:11,428 --> 00:29:13,052
Was there one
in the last one?

278
00:29:13,095 --> 00:29:18,135
"There has been someone else,
a very able and efficient ally.

279
00:29:18,178 --> 00:29:21,177
Doctor, could you
scale this wall?"

280
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:27,469
Yes, but not quite the same without
that Moriarty chap, though.

281
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:29,220
Here we are, Vivvie!

282
00:29:29,262 --> 00:29:30,761
"I looked out the open window

283
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:34,220
The moon shone brightly
on that angle of the house.

284
00:29:34,262 --> 00:29:38,553
We were a good sixty feet above the ground,
but look where I would

285
00:29:38,596 --> 00:29:43,303
there was no foothold, nor as
much as a crevice in the brickwork... "

286
00:29:46,472 --> 00:29:49,471
Oh, careful!

287
00:29:53,555 --> 00:29:55,346
Hey!

288
00:29:58,222 --> 00:30:00,387
<i>Ha, ha, ha!</i>

289
00:30:28,765 --> 00:30:31,098
You can't fall over my feet.

290
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,039
Ha, ha, ha!

291
00:31:32,478 --> 00:31:36,560
I never know...
when it's going to strike.

292
00:31:38,603 --> 00:31:41,018
It's overwork,
as the doctor says.

293
00:31:54,895 --> 00:32:00,061
No, you think you write best
when you get sick

294
00:32:00,105 --> 00:32:03,979
so you make yourself sick,
you know you do.

295
00:32:04,021 --> 00:32:08,395
And you can't expect to
teach and give lectures...

296
00:32:08,438 --> 00:32:12,270
...and write book
reviews and articles...

297
00:32:12,313 --> 00:32:16,479
...and write your poems
and not get sick, Tom.

298
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:20,688
Poetry is a mug's game.

299
00:32:31,606 --> 00:32:32,938
Yes?

300
00:32:35,773 --> 00:32:37,397
Yes.

301
00:32:37,982 --> 00:32:40,814
Without a shadow of a doubt.

302
00:33:59,028 --> 00:34:00,819
Hello, Maurice.

303
00:34:00,862 --> 00:34:05,069
I say, I had no idea
philosophers danced like that.

304
00:34:05,112 --> 00:34:07,527
The most hated man in London?
What do you know.

305
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:10,902
He's been very good to us.
We couldn't have done without him.

306
00:34:12,612 --> 00:34:14,819
I've come to say goodbye, Tom,
just had orders.

307
00:34:14,862 --> 00:34:16,695
- Gallipoli next.
- I envy you.

308
00:34:16,738 --> 00:34:19,278
Yes.
Well you did try.

309
00:34:19,321 --> 00:34:22,653
- If they wouldn't have you, well
it's their loss. - Physically unsound.

310
00:34:22,696 --> 00:34:24,862
That's me, Maurice.

311
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,113
Please.

312
00:34:37,864 --> 00:34:39,988
- Cigarette?
- Yes, please.

313
00:34:52,615 --> 00:34:55,447
So, how's the old
poetry business?

314
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:58,155
It isn't a business,
it's a mug's game.

315
00:34:58,198 --> 00:35:01,114
In fact, I've been thinking
about getting a regular job.

316
00:35:01,156 --> 00:35:05,655
- Gosh. - Well it's advisable
for a poet to have...

317
00:35:05,698 --> 00:35:09,865
...to, to lead a commonplace
life if he's to do his work.

318
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:12,115
Yes, yes well...

319
00:35:13,366 --> 00:35:17,281
I must say, I can't quite get used
to having a poet in the family.

320
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:20,698
- Sort of, married to my own
big sis and such. - Fratris.

321
00:35:20,741 --> 00:35:23,491
- What?
- Brother-in-law.

322
00:35:23,533 --> 00:35:26,366
Ah. Sorry,
my Greek's not up to much.

323
00:35:26,408 --> 00:35:29,574
- It's Latin!
- Ah. Squelch.

324
00:35:33,242 --> 00:35:34,782
Listen, Tom...

325
00:35:35,492 --> 00:35:37,074
Man to man...

326
00:35:37,658 --> 00:35:42,075
There isn't anything...
awful between you and Viv, is there?

327
00:35:42,826 --> 00:35:46,075
Nothing.
Nothing at all.

328
00:35:48,576 --> 00:35:50,075
Well...

329
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:55,408
I say, good luck
with you two.

330
00:35:55,451 --> 00:35:57,701
- It'll all turn out massive
fun in the end. - Massive.

331
00:35:57,744 --> 00:35:59,493
That's the ticket.

332
00:36:03,577 --> 00:36:06,159
Three out of four junior officers
don't come back, Tom.

333
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:14,119
Say cheerio to
Viv for me, will you?

334
00:36:14,161 --> 00:36:16,494
Yes, of course.

335
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:48,162
Tom, how wonderful you look.

336
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:07,247
<i>...That the boys are out
upon a holiday</i>

337
00:37:07,289 --> 00:37:11,455
<i>You'll notice half a dozen fellows
when they're on the spree</i>

338
00:37:11,498 --> 00:37:16,080
<i>In half a dozen minutes,
they are full of jollity.</i>

339
00:37:16,123 --> 00:37:21,539
<i>And they all walk
the wibbly wobbly walk</i>

340
00:37:21,582 --> 00:37:24,831
<i>All talk the wibbly wobbly...</i>

341
00:37:28,499 --> 00:37:30,248
- Blank!
- Who has the question?

342
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,289
- Blank. - Ah.
- Ah, the bishop.

343
00:37:32,332 --> 00:37:35,206
Approximately how many
teeth has a turtle?

344
00:37:35,832 --> 00:37:38,957
- 40?
- Hopelessly wrong!

345
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,665
The Bishop of Oxford is out!

346
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:44,332
A turtle has approximately no
teeth at all, you're out, out!

347
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:46,665
Give his bishopric to someone
who knows something!

348
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:51,790
<i>...All wear
the wibbly wobbly ties</i>

349
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:54,457
<i>and wink at all the pretty girls
with wibbly wobbly...</i>

350
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:00,708
Who has the question?

351
00:38:00,751 --> 00:38:02,291
- Blank!
- Blank!

352
00:38:02,334 --> 00:38:06,083
Minus 40 degrees Centigrade,
is the same as minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit

353
00:38:06,126 --> 00:38:07,375
True or false?

354
00:38:09,126 --> 00:38:11,625
- False!
- True, you're out!

355
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:13,834
Ignoramus!

356
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,417
<i>...Oh, they all smile
the wibbly wobbly smile</i>

357
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:25,376
<i>When the day is dawning</i>

358
00:38:25,418 --> 00:38:28,334
<i>All through
the wibbly wobbly walk...</i>

359
00:38:31,961 --> 00:38:33,585
Blank.

360
00:38:33,628 --> 00:38:36,918
A lady when asked her age
replied she was 35

361
00:38:36,961 --> 00:38:39,252
not counting Saturdays
and Sundays.

362
00:38:39,294 --> 00:38:40,877
What was her real age?

363
00:38:41,503 --> 00:38:43,168
I think she was...

364
00:38:43,586 --> 00:38:44,752
- ... 60!
- Wrong!

365
00:38:45,294 --> 00:38:46,878
Tom may answer.

366
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,169
Come on,
for the cleverest man in England.

367
00:38:49,212 --> 00:38:50,878
Come on, come on.

368
00:38:58,379 --> 00:38:59,544
49?

369
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,044
What was that?

370
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,670
- 49?
- Correct! Correct!

371
00:39:04,713 --> 00:39:08,837
I declare Tom Eliot the
cleverest man in England!

372
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,337
Ah, the benefits of
an American education.

373
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,295
Well done, Tom.

374
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:17,337
Why are you glaring at me?

375
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:25,421
How dare you look
at me like that!

376
00:39:41,007 --> 00:39:43,422
Why give them the pleasure?

377
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:46,631
They'd have been perfectly
happy for you to lose.

378
00:39:46,673 --> 00:39:48,256
We cheated.

379
00:39:48,298 --> 00:39:50,464
Don't be so sanctimonious!

380
00:39:51,507 --> 00:39:54,882
For an American,
you really are a god-awful snob!

381
00:39:54,924 --> 00:39:57,173
Why do you take
them so seriously?

382
00:39:57,216 --> 00:39:59,465
- I mean this whole way of going
on is ridiculous! - Viv, stop it!

383
00:39:59,508 --> 00:40:01,798
- Stop it, you're play-acting!
- It'll be over by the end of the war.

384
00:40:01,841 --> 00:40:04,590
- And good riddance!
- If you're over-awed by their company

385
00:40:04,633 --> 00:40:07,923
then you shouldn't have come!
It isn't good for your nerves.

386
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,633
They were showing off!

387
00:40:12,675 --> 00:40:14,841
And you were showing off

388
00:40:14,884 --> 00:40:17,174
- you wanted to win, I know you did!
- Not by cheating.

389
00:40:17,217 --> 00:40:19,466
No, I know.

390
00:40:19,509 --> 00:40:23,258
You wanted to be honestly,
truly, genuinely superior

391
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,299
as only an American who knows
nothing about anything can be.

392
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,467
Vivienne...

393
00:40:34,468 --> 00:40:36,884
I don't think you're very well.

394
00:40:45,386 --> 00:40:47,968
I've known this sort all my life

395
00:40:48,427 --> 00:40:51,551
and not one of them is
fit to tie your shoelaces.

396
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:24,470
Daddy should never
have done it.

397
00:41:24,513 --> 00:41:27,512
You're not a money-lender.
It's a disgusting idea.

398
00:41:27,554 --> 00:41:29,428
Hardly that.
A banker.

399
00:41:32,721 --> 00:41:35,013
I'll be working at Lloyd's.

400
00:41:35,972 --> 00:41:39,429
Of course,
you won't even consider it.

401
00:41:39,472 --> 00:41:42,513
My poetry has sold
about 200 copies.

402
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,554
- What kind of income do you imagine
that gives us? - You're an artist!

403
00:41:48,597 --> 00:41:51,179
We could always borrow
some more money from Bertie

404
00:41:51,222 --> 00:41:53,347
he doesn't mind a bit.

405
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:56,055
I've already accepted
the position.

406
00:41:56,098 --> 00:41:58,930
Your father has
been immensely kind.

407
00:42:00,265 --> 00:42:03,546
Can't you see what they're doing
to you? They want to bury you,

408
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,222
- they want to drag you down.
- I have no idea who you are talking about.

409
00:42:06,265 --> 00:42:09,515
How can you work when you are locked
in some dungeon of a bank all day?

410
00:42:09,557 --> 00:42:12,681
I shall work at the bank in
the day and write at night

411
00:42:12,724 --> 00:42:16,015
- nothing could be more straightforward.
- But what can I do?

412
00:42:16,057 --> 00:42:19,265
What use can I be if you're
away all day, how can I help?

413
00:42:19,307 --> 00:42:21,765
You do help.
All the time.

414
00:42:21,807 --> 00:42:23,640
With everything.

415
00:42:31,267 --> 00:42:32,724
Well...

416
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,724
Bertie has offered to
take me to the seaside.

417
00:42:37,767 --> 00:42:39,891
What do you
think about that?

418
00:42:43,601 --> 00:42:45,683
Well you know I can't come.

419
00:42:45,726 --> 00:42:48,683
Of course not.
What could I expect?

420
00:42:49,893 --> 00:42:52,308
Important affairs
at the bank, I suppose.

421
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:03,559
Well Vivvie, you must go,
if you want to.

422
00:43:05,227 --> 00:43:07,059
It'll be good for you.

423
00:43:43,562 --> 00:43:45,353
Telegram, Mr Eliot.

424
00:43:56,272 --> 00:43:59,521
Please come Tom,
she's very low.

425
00:43:59,563 --> 00:44:03,646
An influenza's settled on her chest.
I am sorry.

426
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:20,563
Viv and I,
I want you to know

427
00:44:20,606 --> 00:44:23,022
that I have absolutely nothing
to reproach myself with.

428
00:44:23,064 --> 00:44:25,439
Of course you haven't, Bertie.

429
00:44:25,482 --> 00:44:27,814
You're our closest friend.

430
00:44:36,649 --> 00:44:38,439
Tom?

431
00:44:40,941 --> 00:44:42,524
I'm here.

432
00:44:47,441 --> 00:44:49,982
I'm sorry to be a nuisance.

433
00:44:50,733 --> 00:44:54,065
- It's an awful bore, dying.
- Nobody's dying

434
00:44:58,026 --> 00:45:01,608
I did so want to help
you with your poetry.

435
00:45:01,651 --> 00:45:03,066
You will.

436
00:45:03,776 --> 00:45:06,983
You do.
You're in every line.

437
00:45:10,734 --> 00:45:13,025
I can't do it without you.

438
00:45:16,818 --> 00:45:18,609
I know.

439
00:45:54,195 --> 00:45:56,028
Can I help you
with anything?

440
00:45:58,862 --> 00:46:00,361
Perhaps.

441
00:46:04,154 --> 00:46:06,029
Perhaps you can.

442
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,362
Woo!

443
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:12,404
Woo!

444
00:46:19,071 --> 00:46:20,737
Viv?

445
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:24,071
Have you seen my shoes?

446
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:27,571
Uh, there's no tea left.

447
00:46:27,614 --> 00:46:31,821
- Shall we make out a shopping list? - And
my trousers, I seem to have mislaid them.

448
00:46:32,406 --> 00:46:34,113
I need a cheque.

449
00:46:34,156 --> 00:46:36,321
You should still be convalescing.

450
00:46:36,364 --> 00:46:39,364
3 pounds should
just about do it.

451
00:46:39,407 --> 00:46:42,156
- I'll buy you some chocolate as a treat.
- Viv, it's time I went.

452
00:46:43,907 --> 00:46:45,822
- Well goodbye, then!
- Well...

453
00:46:45,865 --> 00:46:50,197
I can't very well go to work
without my trousers now, can I?

454
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,072
Viv, where have
you put my clothes?

455
00:46:52,115 --> 00:46:54,906
And my briefcase, where is it?

456
00:46:55,323 --> 00:46:56,740
I'm afraid they've gone.

457
00:46:57,283 --> 00:46:58,615
Vivienne...

458
00:46:59,491 --> 00:47:02,407
A great poet shouldn't have
to work in a squalid little bank

459
00:47:02,449 --> 00:47:06,115
he should be here, writing poems,
where I can help him.

460
00:47:06,158 --> 00:47:09,407
You know we can't
afford to live that way.

461
00:47:09,449 --> 00:47:11,240
Now Viv, please, I must go.

462
00:47:30,118 --> 00:47:32,950
Is Mr Eliot going
to work today?

463
00:47:54,369 --> 00:47:55,993
Tom?

464
00:47:56,036 --> 00:47:58,701
What if it reads...

465
00:47:58,744 --> 00:48:01,826
"What'd you get married for,
if you don't want children?"

466
00:48:03,453 --> 00:48:05,119
I think it's better.

467
00:48:07,828 --> 00:48:10,369
Yes.
Yes it is.

468
00:48:23,163 --> 00:48:25,578
- Good morning, Bishop.
- Good to see you.

469
00:48:25,621 --> 00:48:27,953
- So good of you to come.
- Not at all.

470
00:48:29,246 --> 00:48:31,162
Please, right this way.

471
00:48:31,204 --> 00:48:34,495
- Viv? - I suppose you just
happened to be in the area?

472
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:37,746
I've asked the
Bishop to call, Viv.

473
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:42,996
Vivvie, I'm sure you
have a million things to do.

474
00:48:48,122 --> 00:48:50,746
Oh, I see,
you want to be alone.

475
00:48:50,789 --> 00:48:55,997
Well if you like, I could go up to the roof
and see how long I could dangle in the air.

476
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,414
- If I'm intruding in any way...
- Not at all.

477
00:48:58,456 --> 00:49:01,955
I believe the sale is
still on at Selfridges.

478
00:49:05,165 --> 00:49:07,955
I thought we were working on
your poems today, Tom.

479
00:49:14,332 --> 00:49:19,331
It's very good of you to devote so
much time to an unbeliever, Bishop.

480
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:23,540
I hope you don't think my
husband's looking for religion.

481
00:49:24,499 --> 00:49:28,541
No, what Tom wants is boredom.

482
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:31,166
A boring and conventional life.

483
00:49:31,208 --> 00:49:33,957
He mistakenly thinks
he needs it for his work.

484
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,082
Oh, and if you can arrange it

485
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:39,541
the egotistical little shit
would like to be a saint.

486
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:44,833
And I don't normally
use words like that.

487
00:49:48,834 --> 00:49:53,125
Here, at the base of the brain,
there is the pituitary gland.

488
00:49:54,043 --> 00:49:58,625
Now we know it is linked to
instances of dementia.

489
00:49:58,668 --> 00:50:02,209
Here, in the lower stomach

490
00:50:02,252 --> 00:50:05,168
there is unceasing colic.

491
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:10,834
We're certain that there is a link
between the gland and the colic.

492
00:50:10,877 --> 00:50:14,959
She feels heights
of enthusiasm

493
00:50:15,002 --> 00:50:19,544
- and then sudden great
falls of emotion. - Indeed.

494
00:50:21,461 --> 00:50:24,085
Well unfortunately...

495
00:50:24,128 --> 00:50:26,502
...she has what I call...

496
00:50:26,545 --> 00:50:28,294
...intestinal catarrh.

497
00:50:28,336 --> 00:50:31,877
She cannot control
her menstrual life.

498
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,335
Apart from the drugs that
I am already prescribing her

499
00:50:35,378 --> 00:50:38,003
there's little we can do
to control the symptoms.

500
00:50:39,379 --> 00:50:41,420
May I ask about the marriage?

501
00:50:44,212 --> 00:50:45,753
We love each other.

502
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:48,003
I see.

503
00:50:48,046 --> 00:50:51,795
And there are no problems?
Beyond what I imagine must...

504
00:50:51,837 --> 00:50:53,046
No.

505
00:50:54,213 --> 00:50:55,671
None.

506
00:50:57,922 --> 00:50:59,629
Do you intend to have children?

507
00:51:01,047 --> 00:51:02,587
Well...

508
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:03,796
Uh...

509
00:51:05,297 --> 00:51:07,087
We have never discussed it.

510
00:51:12,131 --> 00:51:15,797
I think I should tell you that your wife's
condition will not improve, it may worsen.

511
00:51:16,881 --> 00:51:19,922
- What do I tell Vivienne?
- As little as possible.

512
00:51:21,464 --> 00:51:24,838
With a patient like this
it's important not to...

513
00:51:26,757 --> 00:51:28,506
...burden her with details.

514
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,423
Yes?

515
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:43,215
- Maurice, home at last!
- And not dead, either!

516
00:51:43,258 --> 00:51:46,424
Oh, my dear fellow, how did
you survive all that shooting?

517
00:51:46,466 --> 00:51:49,257
Oh, simple really, just ducked
when I saw the bullets coming!

518
00:51:50,258 --> 00:51:53,215
Well you look, you...
you sound different, you look...

519
00:51:53,258 --> 00:51:56,424
- How do I look Maurice?
- The spitting image of a banker.

520
00:51:56,466 --> 00:51:58,882
A true blue, English banker!

521
00:51:58,925 --> 00:52:02,050
Well, my dear fellow,
we must celebrate!

522
00:52:02,092 --> 00:52:03,550
Please.

523
00:52:12,342 --> 00:52:15,175
Shall I send out for
some champagne?

524
00:52:15,217 --> 00:52:18,176
Oh, gosh no,
the old firewater's just the ticket!

525
00:52:29,718 --> 00:52:31,717
So, how are you both?

526
00:52:33,761 --> 00:52:35,718
We couldn't be happier.

527
00:52:35,761 --> 00:52:38,260
Viv goes dancing,
twice a week.

528
00:52:38,303 --> 00:52:39,802
Me too, sometimes.

529
00:52:39,844 --> 00:52:42,385
Saturdays at the theatre.

530
00:52:42,428 --> 00:52:43,802
That's us.

531
00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:48,552
And how are you, Maurice?

532
00:52:49,219 --> 00:52:51,344
Oh, pretty fair.

533
00:52:51,387 --> 00:52:53,344
Looking all over for a job.

534
00:52:54,262 --> 00:52:56,094
No-one wants to employ me.

535
00:52:56,887 --> 00:52:58,594
Don't you think
that's a bit off?

536
00:52:58,637 --> 00:53:01,136
After all, I have just
won the bloody war.

537
00:53:21,096 --> 00:53:25,888
It's called
"He do the Police in Different Voices"

538
00:53:25,931 --> 00:53:28,346
One thing you need,
it's a catchy title.

539
00:53:29,264 --> 00:53:32,555
Oh, of course,
it's a work in progress.

540
00:53:34,514 --> 00:53:39,721
It might help if you try to imagine
Tom's poetry as a smashed vase.

541
00:53:39,764 --> 00:53:41,389
Ah, naturally.

542
00:53:42,307 --> 00:53:47,181
You have to understand that Tom
quotes from many different sources.

543
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:49,161
The main character,

544
00:53:49,205 --> 00:53:54,367
the prophet Tiresias has just seen
Athena's body quite naked

545
00:53:54,402 --> 00:53:57,931
and it's such a frightful shock to him that
he can think of nothing but rats in a sewer.

546
00:53:57,973 --> 00:54:00,432
Vivvie, I really don't
think it needs...

547
00:54:00,474 --> 00:54:03,682
Is there anything more I need
to know before I hear the poem?

548
00:54:03,724 --> 00:54:06,348
Other voices emerge...

549
00:54:06,391 --> 00:54:08,598
The Duchess from Webster's Malfi.

550
00:54:08,641 --> 00:54:11,723
She'd made a reckless
marriage to Antonio.

551
00:54:11,766 --> 00:54:14,182
Her family go to
every length to stop it

552
00:54:14,224 --> 00:54:16,599
there's a moment where
she brushes her hair

553
00:54:16,642 --> 00:54:20,016
and he cannot bring himself to touch her,
the horror engulfs...

554
00:54:20,059 --> 00:54:21,474
That's not what I meant at all.

555
00:54:21,517 --> 00:54:24,433
It is.
Of course it is!

556
00:54:24,475 --> 00:54:26,683
He, he quotes from Dante.

557
00:54:26,725 --> 00:54:29,641
A soldier makes
a hasty marriage.

558
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:33,100
Soon after the wedding he discovers
he's made a hideous mistake...

559
00:54:33,143 --> 00:54:35,767
Vivvie please,
this is really unnecessary.

560
00:54:36,518 --> 00:54:38,517
Oh, is that the time?

561
00:54:40,393 --> 00:54:43,850
Charles dear,
it is time for your medicine.

562
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:48,725
- But I'll miss the poem.
- I think it is time, dear.

563
00:55:06,103 --> 00:55:08,567
'He do the Police
in Different Voices'

564
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:18,394
<i>"My nerves are bad tonight.</i>

565
00:55:18,437 --> 00:55:20,894
<i>"Yes, bad.
Stay with me.</i>

566
00:55:22,478 --> 00:55:26,645
<i>"Speak to me,
why do you never speak? Speak.</i>

567
00:55:27,688 --> 00:55:31,978
<i>"What are you thinking of?
What thinking? What?</i>

568
00:55:33,729 --> 00:55:36,937
<i>"I never know what
you are thinking. Think. "</i>

569
00:55:38,729 --> 00:55:41,479
<i>"I think we
are in rats' alley...</i>

570
00:55:41,522 --> 00:55:44,396
<i>"Where the dead men
lost their bones. "</i>

571
00:55:45,689 --> 00:55:49,479
<i>"What shall I do now?
What shall I do?</i>

572
00:55:50,355 --> 00:55:53,688
<i>"I shall rush out as I am,
and walk the street with my hair down, so...</i>

573
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:57,272
<i>"What shall we do tomorrow?
What shall we ever do?"</i>

574
00:56:26,774 --> 00:56:28,690
There it is.

575
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:45,899
More wine, madam?

576
00:57:06,194 --> 00:57:07,818
Tom looks rather bloody.

577
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,818
There's nothing wrong with Tom that
separation from his wife couldn't cure.

578
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,276
She reeks of ether.

579
00:57:13,569 --> 00:57:16,901
If she had any conception of
his significance, it would be less alarming.

580
00:57:16,944 --> 00:57:20,734
- The drain on his energy must be...
- I know, unimaginable.

581
00:57:36,195 --> 00:57:38,861
I don't keep a line
that Viv hasn't proofed.

582
00:57:39,946 --> 00:57:43,445
I rely on her completely,
she's my first audience.

583
00:57:43,487 --> 00:57:46,528
- Of course.
- She's a writer, too.

584
00:57:46,571 --> 00:57:49,153
- Considerable talent.
- Really?

585
00:57:49,196 --> 00:57:51,986
I'll send you some
of the things, shall I?

586
00:57:53,529 --> 00:57:56,154
You do realise of course,
what she's doing to you?

587
00:57:56,655 --> 00:57:59,404
To your reputation?
What she might do to your work.

588
00:57:59,447 --> 00:58:01,237
You're wrong.
You're quite wrong.

589
00:58:02,155 --> 00:58:04,862
You have no idea,
you don't know her.

590
00:58:04,905 --> 00:58:10,571
She has... an uncanny understanding
of certain things.

591
00:58:16,198 --> 00:58:18,363
I haven't made her happy.

592
00:58:21,573 --> 00:58:23,572
Some moments in life...

593
00:58:24,989 --> 00:58:26,530
...decisions...

594
00:58:27,406 --> 00:58:28,989
...are irrevocable.

595
00:58:31,782 --> 00:58:34,823
Perhaps one can
become moral...

596
00:58:35,699 --> 00:58:37,614
...only by being damned.

597
00:58:39,824 --> 00:58:41,989
She's often in a lot of pain.

598
00:58:42,907 --> 00:58:44,656
I must take care of her.

599
00:58:45,157 --> 00:58:46,657
That's what I must do.

600
00:58:59,158 --> 00:59:01,699
Of course Virginia thinks
Tom should leave me.

601
00:59:03,326 --> 00:59:05,741
She refers to me
as a bag of ferrets.

602
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:09,825
It's my nerves you see,
"writer's insight. " Well she should know.

603
00:59:09,867 --> 00:59:12,825
Lenoard has her in and out of the
looney bin every couple of months.

604
00:59:17,201 --> 00:59:19,992
They all hate me because I've
got Tom and they all want him.

605
00:59:20,993 --> 00:59:24,784
Ottoline's desperate
for an affair with Tom!

606
00:59:28,618 --> 00:59:33,117
Lawrence says,
Ottoline's vagina is like a bird's beak.

607
00:59:36,411 --> 00:59:40,285
I know he's always been
totally disgusted, but...

608
00:59:42,994 --> 00:59:45,243
A bird's beak!

609
00:59:50,744 --> 00:59:52,743
Why is there never any wine?

610
00:59:55,704 --> 00:59:59,161
They all admire Tom's mind.
I am his mind.

611
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:04,244
- Ma'am?
- Oh, good.

612
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:29,205
What time are you
meeting Lady Botwell?

613
01:00:29,247 --> 01:00:30,955
What?

614
01:00:31,497 --> 01:00:35,163
- Six o'clock at the Grafton, wasn't it?
- Er, yes.

615
01:00:35,206 --> 01:00:37,038
See you there then, shall I?

616
01:00:37,081 --> 01:00:41,205
You know how good I am at breaking the ice,
which will need some handling, so...

617
01:00:41,247 --> 01:00:44,289
Why don't you go
to the private bar?

618
01:00:44,332 --> 01:00:46,289
I'll meet with her

619
01:00:46,332 --> 01:00:48,956
and then I'll send a waiter over
and you can be introduced.

620
01:00:49,915 --> 01:00:51,956
You don't want us to
meet with her together?

621
01:00:51,998 --> 01:00:54,081
It's not that, it's just...

622
01:00:54,123 --> 01:00:58,039
I just... need some
time with her alone.

623
01:00:58,873 --> 01:01:01,665
Some time with her alone?

624
01:01:01,708 --> 01:01:03,915
Who gave you the
title to The Wasteland?

625
01:01:04,666 --> 01:01:05,790
Me.

626
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:09,832
Who wrote half your begging letters and
did your correspondence when you were ill?

627
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:11,498
Me.

628
01:01:11,541 --> 01:01:14,665
Lady Botwell is the daughter
of a draper from Whitby.

629
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:16,165
She's no more breeding
than a rabbit.

630
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:20,458
You don't know the difference between a
trumped-up title and real breeding and I do!

631
01:01:23,209 --> 01:01:25,749
Shall we say the
Grafton at six then?

632
01:01:27,292 --> 01:01:29,041
Perfect.

633
01:01:30,042 --> 01:01:31,208
Excuse me.

634
01:01:35,251 --> 01:01:36,625
Morning, all.

635
01:01:36,668 --> 01:01:38,625
Oh, God, my head...

636
01:01:40,626 --> 01:01:42,375
You heard all that, I take it?

637
01:01:43,126 --> 01:01:45,792
Gosh no, I can listen
to people all night

638
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:47,584
goes in one ear,
flies out the other kind of thing.

639
01:01:47,626 --> 01:01:50,292
- Is that right?
- Nothing in the middle to hold it up.

640
01:01:50,335 --> 01:01:53,001
For God's sakes,
you insufferable oaf!

641
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,335
Help us.

642
01:02:05,752 --> 01:02:09,086
The trust-fund accounts for everything,
Mrs Haigh-Wood.

643
01:02:13,712 --> 01:02:15,919
What about Viv?

644
01:02:15,962 --> 01:02:18,836
What is she to be told?

645
01:02:18,878 --> 01:02:21,752
I don't want to over-burden her.

646
01:02:21,795 --> 01:02:24,627
She doesn't understand money.

647
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:27,253
Charles had the greatest
confidence in you.

648
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:31,170
Viv will be taken care of
just as she always has been

649
01:02:31,213 --> 01:02:33,045
without fuss.

650
01:02:36,838 --> 01:02:40,253
- Where is she, anyway?
- Selfridges I think.

651
01:02:42,464 --> 01:02:44,379
Have I missed anything?

652
01:02:44,422 --> 01:02:47,379
- There you are.
- Looking so lovely.

653
01:02:47,922 --> 01:02:51,296
So...
how much has Daddy left?

654
01:02:52,464 --> 01:02:55,379
What's my share?
I'm the eldest child.

655
01:02:57,172 --> 01:03:00,797
We were just talking about
Mum's life and her evenings.

656
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:04,672
She's going to be jolly lonely now, so I've
proposed we should all play more bridge.

657
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:05,993
Oh, by the way,

658
01:03:06,174 --> 01:03:10,108
Tom and I can't go on living in that
awful little hole in Crawford Mansions.

659
01:03:10,173 --> 01:03:12,297
Tom is quite famous now

660
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:15,589
and there's a house in Chester Street
which would be quite perfect for him.

661
01:03:15,631 --> 01:03:17,465
And we need a motorcar.

662
01:03:25,674 --> 01:03:26,965
What's this?

663
01:03:27,007 --> 01:03:31,215
It's a list of property
holdings and investments.

664
01:03:32,466 --> 01:03:35,466
Houses?
In Manchester and London.

665
01:03:36,133 --> 01:03:39,007
I didn't know we had
a farm in Anglesey.

666
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:42,591
So um, what is it
when we add it all up?

667
01:03:42,633 --> 01:03:46,341
The trust was set up to protect
the estate against taxes

668
01:03:46,383 --> 01:03:50,258
one does not "add it all up",
that's just the point.

669
01:03:52,009 --> 01:03:53,717
So what's my share?

670
01:03:56,593 --> 01:03:58,925
I have to be independent,
you know.

671
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:02,050
Tom's family won't let me
inherit anything from him

672
01:04:02,093 --> 01:04:05,550
they're quite adamant about that,
so I have to know where I stand.

673
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:10,884
You see, your father didn't want you
to bother with any awful papers

674
01:04:10,927 --> 01:04:14,468
so what he's done is...

675
01:04:15,427 --> 01:04:17,759
...he hasn't said anything
about you in the will.

676
01:04:17,802 --> 01:04:21,176
You are all tenants
of the trust

677
01:04:21,219 --> 01:04:23,969
the trustees have
power of attorney.

678
01:04:26,136 --> 01:04:27,677
And who are they?

679
01:04:28,845 --> 01:04:31,344
Maurice and myself.

680
01:04:34,178 --> 01:04:37,760
Oh, so it's alright?
The house and the car?

681
01:04:38,511 --> 01:04:41,220
Darling, leave it to the boys.

682
01:04:41,262 --> 01:04:42,845
They know best.

683
01:04:42,887 --> 01:04:45,178
I have a right to some
of Daddy's money.

684
01:04:46,596 --> 01:04:50,303
Viv, there's no money
to share as such...

685
01:04:54,137 --> 01:04:57,762
Viv, please, please, are you sure
you wouldn't like to go home?

686
01:04:57,805 --> 01:05:00,346
The solicitor will
arrange everything.

687
01:05:00,388 --> 01:05:04,804
Oh, the solicitor, what else
does the solicitor have to arrange?

688
01:05:04,847 --> 01:05:07,929
Does the solicitor know that Tom
and I sleep in separate rooms?

689
01:05:07,972 --> 01:05:10,137
- And that I've driven him to it?
- You have not.

690
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:12,304
And divorce.

691
01:05:12,347 --> 01:05:15,763
- Tom's friends say we should divorce.
- There's been no talk of divorce.

692
01:05:15,806 --> 01:05:20,680
And does he know that there are times when
I'm not allowed in the same room as you?

693
01:05:20,723 --> 01:05:23,305
Particularly when the
Bishop of Oxford calls.

694
01:05:23,348 --> 01:05:26,097
Tom wants me baptised
into the Church of England.

695
01:05:26,139 --> 01:05:31,055
Now if a big baby wants to stick his
head into a bowl, it's called baptism.

696
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:34,098
If I want to do it?
It's called shampoo.

697
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:40,348
And, and, has the solicitor taken
into account Tom's sandwiches?

698
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:43,848
- Sandwiches?
- God knows I'm tired of making them!

699
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:47,264
God knows he takes them
each day into the office

700
01:05:47,307 --> 01:05:49,557
and then dives round to
a little church in the city

701
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,765
and ploughs through the
cheese and pickle on his knees?

702
01:05:51,808 --> 01:05:54,099
I mean what do you suppose is
the legal position on sandwiches?

703
01:05:59,558 --> 01:06:01,932
Oh, I see, I'm ill again, am I?

704
01:06:05,684 --> 01:06:06,975
No.

705
01:06:07,934 --> 01:06:10,183
No I can hear myself.

706
01:06:11,309 --> 01:06:13,725
I know perfectly well
what I'm saying.

707
01:06:18,017 --> 01:06:20,433
Let's just pretend
I never came in.

708
01:06:26,643 --> 01:06:29,017
Just carry on as before.

709
01:06:30,518 --> 01:06:32,184
Please.

710
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:51,060
By the way, I've been thinking
that I might toddle off to Africa.

711
01:06:52,644 --> 01:06:54,935
Try my luck, so to speak.

712
01:06:56,729 --> 01:07:00,019
Well there doesn't seem to be much
opportunity in England these days

713
01:07:00,604 --> 01:07:02,186
does there?

714
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:08,311
Thank you,
thank you very much.

715
01:07:08,354 --> 01:07:12,645
This next poem is called Marina.

716
01:07:12,688 --> 01:07:18,520
The title will of course be quite clear to
anyone familiar with Shakespeare's Pericles.

717
01:07:20,271 --> 01:07:24,937
No poet can truthfully tell
you the origin of a poem

718
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:28,187
however personal
a poem may seem.

719
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:30,767
What makes it a poem,

720
01:07:30,788 --> 01:07:34,872
will not derive from the
fact that it is personal.

721
01:07:34,939 --> 01:07:39,605
Poetry is not an
expression of emotion

722
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:43,605
but an escape from emotion.

723
01:07:58,065 --> 01:07:59,522
Hello?

724
01:07:59,565 --> 01:08:01,147
Oh, Mrs Eliot, hello.

725
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:02,772
Won't be a moment.

726
01:08:04,566 --> 01:08:08,690
Rooms came with the job, Ma'am.
Night nurse.

727
01:08:09,858 --> 01:08:12,898
First time they've ever given
the position to a woman.

728
01:08:14,816 --> 01:08:17,690
I'm so pleased for you, Louise.

729
01:08:20,108 --> 01:08:23,858
My husband's reading to some
friends in our new house.

730
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:25,566
You should be there, Ma'am.

731
01:08:25,609 --> 01:08:28,483
Oh, I know them
all off by heart.

732
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:31,024
It's his fifth book of poems.

733
01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:33,524
Wonderful.

734
01:08:35,109 --> 01:08:37,859
700 people bought
the last one.

735
01:08:37,901 --> 01:08:40,400
Proper best seller.

736
01:08:51,651 --> 01:08:53,900
Sometimes I feel you're
my only friend, Louise.

737
01:08:55,319 --> 01:08:58,651
- But you know so many people.
- Oh, it's Tom they come to see!

738
01:09:01,402 --> 01:09:03,068
What about your family?

739
01:09:03,111 --> 01:09:05,776
Oh, well they just say um...

740
01:09:05,819 --> 01:09:08,276
poor Tom,
he's got his hands full.

741
01:09:11,612 --> 01:09:13,402
I'm glad about Mr Eliot, though

742
01:09:14,028 --> 01:09:16,194
being so busy and important.

743
01:09:16,237 --> 01:09:18,694
Oh, he's in a spin alright, yes.

744
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:22,819
Ever since he left the bank
and took the job in publishing

745
01:09:22,862 --> 01:09:25,152
everyone wants to see him.

746
01:09:25,195 --> 01:09:29,237
Like bees round a honeypot,
I hardly ever see him now.

747
01:09:38,613 --> 01:09:40,695
Isn't that awfully difficult?

748
01:09:42,029 --> 01:09:43,737
Oh, I never think
about it, Ma'am.

749
01:09:44,529 --> 01:09:46,821
Just something for idle hands.

750
01:10:23,824 --> 01:10:27,406
As we have discussed before,
the uneven flow from the pituitary glands

751
01:10:27,449 --> 01:10:30,906
somehow feeds down
to the ovulation cycle.

752
01:10:34,657 --> 01:10:38,199
But in addition to this

753
01:10:38,242 --> 01:10:41,449
Vivienne has what
I prefer to call...

754
01:10:41,492 --> 01:10:44,116
...a febrile disease of the mind.

755
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:48,949
And that is why I have
asked Dr Miller here today

756
01:10:48,992 --> 01:10:51,241
to explain the condition.

757
01:11:03,701 --> 01:11:08,450
In fact, we consider it a secondary
form of mental disease.

758
01:11:08,493 --> 01:11:13,909
And it is notorious in attacking
young women of exceptional gifts.

759
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:20,243
The patient fails to understand her
social position and her duty to society.

760
01:11:21,827 --> 01:11:25,118
She becomes vulgar
and impulsive

761
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:28,869
and frequently shows a
rebellious disregard for propriety.

762
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:33,702
And it is this condition

763
01:11:33,745 --> 01:11:39,327
the law and the medical professions
define as moral insanity.

764
01:11:41,661 --> 01:11:42,869
Insanity?

765
01:11:44,162 --> 01:11:46,161
Technically, yes.

766
01:12:11,997 --> 01:12:14,037
Thank you.

767
01:12:27,414 --> 01:12:29,955
Hello, T.S. Eliot's office.

768
01:12:32,289 --> 01:12:34,623
Mr Eliot, please.

769
01:12:34,665 --> 01:12:36,289
Who is this?

770
01:12:38,290 --> 01:12:39,706
Who's speaking please?

771
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:42,498
Would you tell him
his wife is calling?

772
01:12:43,749 --> 01:12:45,539
One moment, please.

773
01:12:53,541 --> 01:12:57,790
I'm sorry Mrs Eliot but Mr Eliot isn't...
your husband's not here just now.

774
01:12:57,833 --> 01:13:00,374
I know perfectly
well he's there!

775
01:13:00,416 --> 01:13:04,040
And working too hard to keep you in a job,
that's what he's doing! Now...

776
01:13:11,209 --> 01:13:16,041
Is this some deliberate
attempt to provoke me?

777
01:13:16,667 --> 01:13:21,166
Get me the chairman at once,
I want to speak to Mr Faber immediately!

778
01:13:21,209 --> 01:13:23,791
I'm terribly sorry,
but I'm under strict instructions

779
01:13:23,834 --> 01:13:27,001
- not to allow anybody...
- Oh, for God's sake!

780
01:13:28,127 --> 01:13:31,126
I am coming over this instant!

781
01:13:31,168 --> 01:13:33,292
I am opposite this building

782
01:13:33,335 --> 01:13:36,417
and I am going to make the most
awful stink you ever heard.

783
01:13:59,004 --> 01:14:02,961
I only wanted to leave a small
bar of chocolate for my husband.

784
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:15,382
Anything for me?

785
01:15:17,383 --> 01:15:18,965
Thank you.

786
01:15:24,842 --> 01:15:27,216
Oh!

787
01:15:30,384 --> 01:15:32,966
I thought I'd take
you by surprise!

788
01:15:33,884 --> 01:15:36,674
A very pleasant surprise indeed.

789
01:15:36,717 --> 01:15:39,383
How very good
of you to visit.

790
01:15:54,926 --> 01:15:57,426
We'll be undisturbed here.

791
01:16:03,594 --> 01:16:05,010
What has she done?

792
01:16:10,511 --> 01:16:12,843
Hurry, yes.

793
01:16:26,262 --> 01:16:28,427
I'm so sorry...

794
01:16:31,096 --> 01:16:34,053
I'll never do it again,
I'll be good.

795
01:16:35,846 --> 01:16:38,178
Leave me, leave me.

796
01:16:39,513 --> 01:16:42,428
Oh, I'm so ashamed.

797
01:16:46,679 --> 01:16:49,304
I'll be good.

798
01:16:49,347 --> 01:16:51,221
I'm sorry.

799
01:17:16,556 --> 01:17:19,430
- Forgive me.
- Tom...

800
01:17:30,141 --> 01:17:32,640
Don't look at me.

801
01:17:32,682 --> 01:17:34,890
What is it that you want?

802
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,932
I want nothing.

803
01:17:41,975 --> 01:17:44,682
That's precisely
what you have.

804
01:17:44,725 --> 01:17:47,891
You can't go on like this,
neither of you.

805
01:17:48,892 --> 01:17:51,016
What is it that you want?

806
01:17:54,934 --> 01:17:57,475
I am married to a
woman that I love...

807
01:17:59,809 --> 01:18:03,225
...but everything we
do together falls apart.

808
01:18:04,851 --> 01:18:07,142
I crave companionship...

809
01:18:08,393 --> 01:18:11,142
...but I am completely alone.

810
01:19:33,814 --> 01:19:36,189
I'm sorry Madam,
there's a private ceremony.

811
01:19:36,232 --> 01:19:39,064
- I'm sorry I can't do that.
- I'm Mr Eliot's wife

812
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:41,314
- I've a right to be here!
- I'm sorry, the bishop's...

813
01:19:44,357 --> 01:19:50,148
Ephpheta, quod est...
Adaperire...

814
01:19:50,899 --> 01:19:54,190
In Odorem suavitatis...

815
01:19:55,525 --> 01:19:57,482
Please excuse me!

816
01:20:00,907 --> 01:20:06,857
I, Thomas, renounce the devil
and all his works.

817
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:10,358
The vain, pomp and
glory of this world...

818
01:20:10,401 --> 01:20:13,525
...the carnal desires
of the flesh.

819
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:17,858
I believe in the Holy Ghost

820
01:20:17,901 --> 01:20:22,066
the Holy Catholic Church,
the Communion of Saints...

821
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:26,108
...the Remission of Sins,
the Resurrection of the Flesh...

822
01:20:26,151 --> 01:20:29,234
...and everlasting life.

823
01:20:29,277 --> 01:20:31,776
Ego te baptizo in nomine patris.

824
01:20:32,902 --> 01:20:34,026
Madam, please!

825
01:20:34,068 --> 01:20:35,026
Et filii...

826
01:20:35,068 --> 01:20:36,651
The door is locked!

827
01:20:36,693 --> 01:20:37,942
...et spiritus, sancti.

828
01:21:08,779 --> 01:21:10,111
Tom.

829
01:21:11,029 --> 01:21:12,861
It's only 6 o'clock.

830
01:21:18,446 --> 01:21:21,070
I'm going to Communion.

831
01:21:23,488 --> 01:21:25,487
I thought you might
stay a while.

832
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:30,112
I can't.

833
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:35,571
I um...

834
01:21:35,614 --> 01:21:38,030
I, I seem to be...

835
01:21:38,072 --> 01:21:40,821
I seem to be free today if there's
any work you need typing up.

836
01:21:43,989 --> 01:21:46,946
I have a secretary
who does all that.

837
01:22:02,115 --> 01:22:04,065
Taxi!

838
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:08,305
Taxi!

839
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:10,663
Taxi!

840
01:22:14,033 --> 01:22:16,698
- Why Vivienne!
- Hello Vivvie!

841
01:22:19,158 --> 01:22:20,740
Hello, Vivienne.

842
01:22:21,741 --> 01:22:23,698
No, no you've
made a mistake

843
01:22:23,741 --> 01:22:27,241
you're confusing me with that
other woman who is so like me.

844
01:22:27,284 --> 01:22:29,074
She's always getting
me into terrible trouble.

845
01:22:29,117 --> 01:22:32,116
- How absurd!
- And if you don't go away this minute!

846
01:22:33,325 --> 01:22:35,908
Don't be silly,
you are Vivienne Eliot!

847
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:42,992
I am not Vivienne Eliot.

848
01:22:43,035 --> 01:22:45,117
I never have been,
is that clear?

849
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,409
- Yes!
- Yes it is.

850
01:22:46,451 --> 01:22:48,950
- Is it?
- Yes it's perfectly, perfectly clear.

851
01:22:48,993 --> 01:22:52,242
- Huge mistake, of course.
- You are not Vivienne Eliot.

852
01:23:02,786 --> 01:23:06,410
One simply has to fight tooth and nail
to get a cab at this time of day.

853
01:23:50,789 --> 01:23:54,788
Dear Mr Eliot, thank you
for your reply of the 16th.

854
01:23:54,830 --> 01:23:57,712
The faculty is naturally
delighted that you have

855
01:23:57,833 --> 01:24:01,498
accepted the chair of poetry
at Harvard University.

856
01:24:01,533 --> 01:24:05,996
Tenure will be for one year
commencing September, 1932.

857
01:24:06,039 --> 01:24:08,705
Would you be kind enough
to relay your travel plans

858
01:24:08,748 --> 01:24:12,455
so that arrangements for suitable
accommodation can be made?

859
01:24:12,498 --> 01:24:16,830
Yours sincerely, G.T. Lowell,
President, Harvard University.

860
01:24:25,749 --> 01:24:28,165
Oh, look, there he is!

861
01:24:28,541 --> 01:24:30,248
- Hello!
- There she is!

862
01:24:32,332 --> 01:24:34,581
Dear friend!

863
01:24:34,624 --> 01:24:36,665
Great white hunter!

864
01:24:41,378 --> 01:24:45,306
- Dear Vivvie, look at you,
you look marvellous! - And you're huge!

865
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:50,332
Tom my dear fellow,
marvellous to see you!

866
01:24:50,375 --> 01:24:52,874
Look at you,
look at you both!

867
01:24:54,375 --> 01:24:56,957
So, how's England
treating you, Tom?

868
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,292
Aces all round.
New house, new car.

869
01:25:00,334 --> 01:25:01,875
Same wife!

870
01:25:01,918 --> 01:25:04,375
Tell us about Africa.

871
01:25:04,418 --> 01:25:07,792
- Well uh, totally huge,
swimming with gin and elephants. - Yes.

872
01:25:07,834 --> 01:25:09,833
Natives speaking
English to a man.

873
01:25:09,876 --> 01:25:13,250
Oh, Tom I must tell you,
I met this American filly in Mombasa

874
01:25:13,293 --> 01:25:15,626
and she was actually
reading one of your books.

875
01:25:15,669 --> 01:25:18,251
- Oh, splendid!
- Ecstatic, who'd have believed it?

876
01:25:18,294 --> 01:25:21,709
- Right here. - 'Oh, God', I said,
'that's old Tom, the frartris!'

877
01:25:21,752 --> 01:25:24,418
Well, worked wonders
in the old courtship front.

878
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:28,543
- Knew poetry would come in useful one day.
- I'm glad to be of use, Maurice!

879
01:25:30,419 --> 01:25:32,544
I say, super motor!

880
01:25:36,378 --> 01:25:39,294
So, what have you
two been up to?

881
01:25:39,336 --> 01:25:42,752
Oh, endless parties.

882
01:25:42,795 --> 01:25:45,419
All Tom's friends come over.

883
01:25:45,461 --> 01:25:48,461
Students banging on the door
at all hours for autographs.

884
01:25:48,504 --> 01:25:50,711
And bishops by the truckload!

885
01:25:50,754 --> 01:25:54,878
- Oh, Tom's one of us now,
British citizen. - Hoorah!

886
01:25:54,921 --> 01:25:57,461
Welcome aboard!

887
01:25:57,504 --> 01:25:59,861
Thinking about kids next,
I shouldn't wonder!

888
01:25:59,883 --> 01:26:02,838
Oh, I don't know about that!
We do have cats, though.

889
01:26:03,754 --> 01:26:07,546
- Both still crazy about chocolate?
- Absolutely mad about it.

890
01:26:08,047 --> 01:26:11,087
Ah, you both sound so happy!

891
01:26:11,130 --> 01:26:12,129
We are.

892
01:26:12,713 --> 01:26:14,046
That's it?

893
01:26:14,088 --> 01:26:15,671
Yes.

894
01:26:42,965 --> 01:26:46,673
Mums, Tom's whole
career is at stake.

895
01:26:46,715 --> 01:26:49,881
He gives lectures to the
Archbishop at Lambeth Palace.

896
01:26:49,924 --> 01:26:51,923
- All that'll go up in smoke!
- Maurice, please.

897
01:26:51,965 --> 01:26:55,799
No, no.
Short memory these top people.

898
01:26:55,841 --> 01:27:00,715
Tom can't take her anywhere. He's terrified
in case she causes another awful scene.

899
01:27:01,010 --> 01:27:03,484
I mean, she's sending letters
around town accusing

900
01:27:03,519 --> 01:27:06,986
- all and sundry of trying to seduce him!
Ask Tom! - Thank you, Maurice.

901
01:27:07,021 --> 01:27:08,965
First the letters, then the car

902
01:27:09,008 --> 01:27:10,757
and my teeth will never
be the same again.

903
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,050
Sometimes she gets car sick.

904
01:27:14,842 --> 01:27:18,633
I know it's not an excuse,
but you might have told her about America.

905
01:27:20,467 --> 01:27:24,466
I left the letter where she could see it.
I thought it best.

906
01:27:24,509 --> 01:27:27,216
So the first thing she knows
of your going to America

907
01:27:27,259 --> 01:27:30,342
for who knows how long,
is a letter on the dining room table?

908
01:27:30,385 --> 01:27:32,509
I can't pretend anymore.

909
01:27:33,343 --> 01:27:34,551
She's sick.

910
01:27:35,593 --> 01:27:37,842
All the doctors
say the same thing.

911
01:27:37,885 --> 01:27:40,384
She's running around town
with a knife in her handbag!

912
01:27:40,427 --> 01:27:42,051
What knife?

913
01:27:42,093 --> 01:27:44,426
The poor sod only has to say
'meet the wife' and a brigade

914
01:27:44,468 --> 01:27:46,968
of these Bloomsbury wallahs
stampede mad-dog for the Causey!

915
01:27:52,011 --> 01:27:53,843
Think of the scandal, Mums

916
01:27:54,511 --> 01:27:56,385
if she goes too far.

917
01:28:07,137 --> 01:28:08,594
Where is Viv?

918
01:28:10,095 --> 01:28:12,553
I sent her off to Harrods.

919
01:28:22,513 --> 01:28:26,595
Mums, this is Mr Janes,
who we were talking about earlier.

920
01:28:27,513 --> 01:28:30,720
- He was a policeman and...
- Maurice, please.

921
01:28:31,888 --> 01:28:36,387
Mr Janes is a medical officer with
the Association of Private Practitioners.

922
01:28:40,306 --> 01:28:42,180
What does a medical officer do?

923
01:28:43,431 --> 01:28:45,305
It's purely hypothetical.

924
01:28:45,931 --> 01:28:49,013
No final decision's been taken.

925
01:28:52,181 --> 01:28:55,639
- Well, Mrs Wood...
- Mrs Haigh-Wood.

926
01:28:57,515 --> 01:29:00,847
I observe the lady
of whom we speak

927
01:29:00,890 --> 01:29:03,389
and report to the family.

928
01:29:03,432 --> 01:29:09,347
In the event of a crisis, two doctors
are obliged to ask the lady two questions

929
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:11,807
of a simple nature.

930
01:29:11,849 --> 01:29:15,223
The next morning I go to the
magistrate's court with a petition.

931
01:29:18,683 --> 01:29:19,765
Yes?

932
01:29:20,808 --> 01:29:23,682
And apply for a
notice of committal.

933
01:29:23,724 --> 01:29:27,265
I then convey her into
the care of her doctors.

934
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:33,308
You mean you bundle her into a straitjacket
and cart her off to the lunatic asylum.

935
01:29:47,518 --> 01:29:49,100
It is vital

936
01:29:49,143 --> 01:29:52,600
that we act together,
as a family.

937
01:30:15,519 --> 01:30:17,185
Good evening, sir.

938
01:30:24,603 --> 01:30:27,311
She has locked herself in,
I thought I'd better call you.

939
01:30:28,062 --> 01:30:29,436
Yes...

940
01:30:29,478 --> 01:30:32,227
I think now's the time, Mr Eliot.

941
01:30:33,228 --> 01:30:34,561
Ah...

942
01:30:41,688 --> 01:30:46,062
I um... took the liberty
of calling the doctors.

943
01:30:46,104 --> 01:30:47,187
Yes...

944
01:30:48,813 --> 01:30:50,312
...I see.

945
01:31:12,648 --> 01:31:15,355
I unlocked the door
the minute I heard you.

946
01:31:15,398 --> 01:31:17,064
Hello, Viv.

947
01:31:19,898 --> 01:31:21,689
It's all going on out there.

948
01:31:22,898 --> 01:31:24,897
We need to be very calm.

949
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,106
Well there's no need for that.

950
01:31:28,941 --> 01:31:30,981
If you want to go out, do.

951
01:31:31,024 --> 01:31:34,315
- I want you to.
- Thank you, but no.

952
01:31:34,357 --> 01:31:36,231
It's good for you.

953
01:31:37,107 --> 01:31:39,398
You can't stay trapped
in here with me.

954
01:31:41,524 --> 01:31:43,774
I do know what goes
on in your mind.

955
01:31:48,108 --> 01:31:50,816
Who is it this time,
Gert or Daisy?

956
01:31:50,858 --> 01:31:53,107
Ooh, you're up to something
and no mistake.

957
01:31:54,692 --> 01:31:56,607
Let's be calm, Vivvie.

958
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:01,775
I keep getting all these horrible
formal letters from your lawyer.

959
01:32:03,484 --> 01:32:06,858
I told them I wanted
to talk to you.

960
01:32:06,901 --> 01:32:09,358
After all,
you are my husband.

961
01:32:11,234 --> 01:32:13,650
We are legally separated.

962
01:32:13,693 --> 01:32:15,858
Oh, that's just a
form of words, isn't it?

963
01:32:16,985 --> 01:32:20,234
"Whom God has joined,
let no man put asunder. "

964
01:32:21,694 --> 01:32:24,068
You're an expert on God,
aren't you?

965
01:32:33,027 --> 01:32:36,027
We are going to have to
talk about things, Vivienne.

966
01:32:37,111 --> 01:32:41,027
Well, we've never done
that before, have we?

967
01:32:41,070 --> 01:32:44,652
You have to understand
what you have done.

968
01:32:46,736 --> 01:32:49,360
We have to face this together.

969
01:33:31,989 --> 01:33:33,738
The motorcar...

970
01:33:34,739 --> 01:33:36,030
...the chocolate...

971
01:33:36,073 --> 01:33:37,822
Oh, that!

972
01:33:38,823 --> 01:33:42,489
Those rats at Faber's
wanted you all to themselves.

973
01:33:42,532 --> 01:33:44,323
There was no room for me.

974
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:46,989
I was so angry
being locked out.

975
01:33:48,032 --> 01:33:52,489
You see, you have to remember
what a success you are.

976
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:56,031
A famous poet,
director of a leading publishers...

977
01:33:56,782 --> 01:33:58,990
I would like some
recognition for that.

978
01:34:00,658 --> 01:34:04,157
After all, the poems come
out of our lives, Tom.

979
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:07,157
I'd like to share just
an inch of that success.

980
01:34:14,533 --> 01:34:17,158
But... why chocolate?

981
01:34:17,659 --> 01:34:19,450
Because you love it!

982
01:34:20,117 --> 01:34:23,450
- Although not quite in that form,
I grant you. - And the car?

983
01:34:24,284 --> 01:34:26,533
You really could've killed us.

984
01:34:26,576 --> 01:34:30,408
- How are Maurice's teeth? - Fine.
- Is the car fixed?

985
01:34:30,451 --> 01:34:33,742
- Yes. - And you and I
are still upright, so...

986
01:34:34,827 --> 01:34:38,784
Look, I felt a rush of
blood to the head.

987
01:34:38,827 --> 01:34:42,284
I was sitting listening to
a string of trivial chatter.

988
01:34:42,327 --> 01:34:44,909
You were vexed by
the conversation?

989
01:34:44,952 --> 01:34:47,951
You were leaving me for a year and
you didn't have the courage to tell me.

990
01:34:48,660 --> 01:34:50,868
Maurice was asking us
questions about ourselves

991
01:34:50,911 --> 01:34:54,868
and I heard us telling him masses
of lies over and over, you see...

992
01:34:56,411 --> 01:35:01,077
...you see that...
that's why I married you, Tom.

993
01:35:01,369 --> 01:35:03,660
To escape from all that.

994
01:35:04,369 --> 01:35:05,869
But you...

995
01:35:06,495 --> 01:35:09,078
Well Tom, you always wanted
to be the perfect Englishman.

996
01:35:17,662 --> 01:35:19,994
All these years Vivvie...

997
01:35:20,037 --> 01:35:21,828
...right from the start.

998
01:35:22,871 --> 01:35:25,870
All the secrets
we had to keep.

999
01:35:26,371 --> 01:35:31,287
Trying not to catch each other's eyes,
because we might realise we were strangers.

1000
01:35:33,913 --> 01:35:39,705
And always the medicines, the doctors,
the experts, the things I was never told

1001
01:35:39,747 --> 01:35:43,205
and the way people
looked at us.

1002
01:35:44,289 --> 01:35:46,788
'There go Tom and Viv. '

1003
01:35:46,831 --> 01:35:49,705
'What do they say
to each other?'

1004
01:35:50,581 --> 01:35:53,496
'Whatever do they say?'

1005
01:35:59,665 --> 01:36:01,247
I have the doctors
in attendance, sir.

1006
01:36:01,290 --> 01:36:02,997
Stay out!

1007
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:04,872
What's going on?

1008
01:36:11,748 --> 01:36:15,332
Two of your doctors
are outside.

1009
01:36:17,791 --> 01:36:21,540
They want to come in and take
a look at you and make a decision.

1010
01:36:21,583 --> 01:36:26,457
- At this time of night?
- They have your best interests at heart

1011
01:36:27,124 --> 01:36:28,332
What decision?

1012
01:36:29,749 --> 01:36:34,541
They need to come in...
and ask you a few questions.

1013
01:36:40,167 --> 01:36:43,041
You won't let them take me
away from you, Tom?

1014
01:36:44,209 --> 01:36:47,167
After all, there've been
good moments in the past.

1015
01:36:50,335 --> 01:36:53,750
We've had our splendid times,
haven't we Tom?

1016
01:36:57,210 --> 01:36:58,459
Yes.

1017
01:37:27,337 --> 01:37:28,711
Are you ready?

1018
01:37:46,379 --> 01:37:48,503
Vivvie darling...

1019
01:37:48,546 --> 01:37:51,253
...if you have a knife...

1020
01:37:52,129 --> 01:37:54,003
...would you give
it to us, please?

1021
01:37:54,922 --> 01:37:57,046
We know you have a knife, there.

1022
01:37:58,005 --> 01:38:00,546
We're being a bit
"Ethel M. Dell", aren't we?

1023
01:38:00,589 --> 01:38:02,921
There have been complaints.

1024
01:38:02,964 --> 01:38:05,838
- From whom?
- Mrs Virginia Woolf.

1025
01:38:07,755 --> 01:38:09,713
And you believe them?

1026
01:38:15,215 --> 01:38:17,005
Well Mums, um...

1027
01:38:17,048 --> 01:38:19,422
I'm afraid it's too late.

1028
01:38:20,506 --> 01:38:22,422
I caught up with Mrs Woolf

1029
01:38:23,006 --> 01:38:25,505
in the ladies room
at Victoria station.

1030
01:38:27,673 --> 01:38:29,798
I'll show you exactly
how I did it.

1031
01:38:31,174 --> 01:38:32,840
Like that!

1032
01:38:32,882 --> 01:38:34,340
And that!

1033
01:38:39,924 --> 01:38:41,881
I bought it in a toy shop.

1034
01:38:43,799 --> 01:38:45,424
Oh, God...

1035
01:38:52,258 --> 01:38:55,007
Now, I believe you have
some questions for me?

1036
01:38:56,425 --> 01:38:59,841
Tom will tell you,
I'm brilliant at puzzles.

1037
01:39:04,718 --> 01:39:06,092
Ahem.

1038
01:39:13,843 --> 01:39:17,092
Rupert, takes his
friends to the opera.

1039
01:39:18,259 --> 01:39:22,176
Rupert is sitting next to
Charles and on his left.

1040
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:26,593
Daphne sits immediately
on Charles' right.

1041
01:39:27,427 --> 01:39:31,343
Clarissa sits somewhere
to the left of Daphne.

1042
01:39:32,635 --> 01:39:35,051
Can you put them in
their correct order?

1043
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:40,552
Clarissa is next to Rupert, Rupert is next
to Charles, Charles is next to Daphne.

1044
01:39:43,553 --> 01:39:46,094
Uh, yes that's correct.

1045
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:52,094
Next!

1046
01:39:54,679 --> 01:39:57,303
The greasy pole
is 10 yards high.

1047
01:39:58,179 --> 01:40:01,345
The little brown monkey
wishes to climb the pole.

1048
01:40:01,387 --> 01:40:04,261
The monkey climbs
3 yards a day.

1049
01:40:04,721 --> 01:40:07,636
Each night,
he slips back 2 yards.

1050
01:40:08,804 --> 01:40:12,471
How many days will it take
him to reach the top?

1051
01:40:50,724 --> 01:40:51,848
Seven.

1052
01:40:58,932 --> 01:40:59,973
Wrong.

1053
01:41:00,725 --> 01:41:02,474
The answer is eight.

1054
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:15,974
A member of the family must
sign for the reception order.

1055
01:41:28,476 --> 01:41:32,683
The uh, Lunacy Act
provides the following.

1056
01:41:32,726 --> 01:41:35,851
All Vivienne's bank accounts
and credit arrangements

1057
01:41:35,893 --> 01:41:39,434
at certain shops
cease immediately.

1058
01:41:39,477 --> 01:41:43,267
She's not allowed to vote,
or drive a vehicle

1059
01:41:43,310 --> 01:41:46,059
or hold any kind of passport.

1060
01:41:46,102 --> 01:41:51,393
She has no right of appeal
at any time for her release.

1061
01:41:51,436 --> 01:41:56,185
After that, everything is at
the discretion of the trustees.

1062
01:41:58,353 --> 01:42:00,602
But what do we
do with Vivvie now?

1063
01:42:01,853 --> 01:42:05,977
Well Mrs Eliot will be completely at
liberty for at least two or three days

1064
01:42:06,019 --> 01:42:09,228
until the magistrates can
approve the reception order.

1065
01:42:10,062 --> 01:42:12,936
Then... she will be committed.

1066
01:42:14,562 --> 01:42:15,686
Excuse me.

1067
01:42:18,145 --> 01:42:21,478
Oh, God... men in white coats.

1068
01:42:44,272 --> 01:42:47,271
Mrs Vivienne Eliot,
under the Lunacy Act

1069
01:42:47,314 --> 01:42:50,896
I'm obliged to take you away from here,
to a proper place of detention.

1070
01:42:50,939 --> 01:42:52,480
How dare you!

1071
01:42:52,522 --> 01:42:55,021
Now we're not gonna have a nasty
scene in a public place, are we?

1072
01:42:56,814 --> 01:42:58,480
I don't see why not.

1073
01:43:17,358 --> 01:43:18,940
Stop it!

1074
01:43:18,983 --> 01:43:21,023
Are we gonna be more
ladylike now, Vivienne?

1075
01:43:21,066 --> 01:43:22,857
Dear God!

1076
01:43:25,399 --> 01:43:28,940
Pay for the tea, would you?
And um, be sure to leave a tip.

1077
01:43:30,358 --> 01:43:32,523
Oh, goodbye Louise.

1078
01:43:33,775 --> 01:43:35,233
Please!

1079
01:43:36,609 --> 01:43:38,441
Ma'am!

1080
01:43:42,525 --> 01:43:44,941
Don't let 'em, Ma'am!

1081
01:44:16,111 --> 01:44:18,901
She was the
first in her class

1082
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:21,485
to audition for
the ballet school.

1083
01:44:23,277 --> 01:44:25,652
And languages...

1084
01:44:25,695 --> 01:44:28,069
Oh, what a gift she had.

1085
01:44:31,487 --> 01:44:35,236
It is a very impressive place.

1086
01:44:35,278 --> 01:44:37,361
Acres of grass...

1087
01:44:38,195 --> 01:44:41,028
Viv will be very comfortable.

1088
01:44:41,071 --> 01:44:43,820
- And it is just for a while.
- Yes.

1089
01:44:48,654 --> 01:44:50,653
After you came to us, I...

1090
01:44:50,696 --> 01:44:53,278
I warned our family
and friends.

1091
01:44:53,321 --> 01:44:55,195
'He's a bit of a stick

1092
01:44:56,321 --> 01:44:58,821
but so eager to be like us. '

1093
01:44:59,739 --> 01:45:04,029
And then, those Bloomsbury
types got hold of you.

1094
01:45:07,239 --> 01:45:10,904
You mustn't think that riff-raff
is the heart of English life.

1095
01:45:12,405 --> 01:45:16,905
It isn't such an achievement
to turn gossip into art.

1096
01:45:17,740 --> 01:45:20,864
And write nasty
novels about one's friends.

1097
01:45:25,115 --> 01:45:27,322
The Haigh-Woods
have been...

1098
01:45:27,365 --> 01:45:29,822
...buried as far afield as...

1099
01:45:30,823 --> 01:45:33,906
...Alberta.
And Nepal.

1100
01:45:34,991 --> 01:45:39,198
Magistrates, counsellors,
church wardens.

1101
01:45:40,491 --> 01:45:42,865
How unfashionable, yes.

1102
01:45:42,907 --> 01:45:46,615
Snigger behind
Bloomsbury shutters

1103
01:45:46,657 --> 01:45:50,032
but that is true British stock.

1104
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:54,199
Goes about its business

1105
01:45:54,950 --> 01:45:56,824
is quiet about it

1106
01:45:58,367 --> 01:46:00,574
quite unexceptional.

1107
01:46:01,492 --> 01:46:03,991
And, I might add

1108
01:46:04,033 --> 01:46:06,450
never before has one of us

1109
01:46:06,493 --> 01:46:09,617
been carted off in disgrace
to a lunatics' house.

1110
01:46:13,409 --> 01:46:16,700
You swore to us Tom,
you would always look after Vivvie.

1111
01:46:18,576 --> 01:46:21,784
So now you're famous
on a bookshelf.

1112
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:25,951
What do we have
left to give you?

1113
01:46:28,285 --> 01:46:30,326
I love this family.

1114
01:46:31,619 --> 01:46:34,409
I've always wanted
to be a part of it.

1115
01:46:35,702 --> 01:46:38,326
- Family unity...
- No, please.

1116
01:46:39,161 --> 01:46:44,119
I've lived all my life in the hope that
Vivvie would be acceptable to someone.

1117
01:46:47,995 --> 01:46:50,452
It's not quite the moment

1118
01:46:51,786 --> 01:46:54,910
to give me the benefit
of your mind.

1119
01:47:08,246 --> 01:47:09,995
Good night, Maurice.

1120
01:47:11,329 --> 01:47:12,662
Tom...

1121
01:47:13,163 --> 01:47:14,412
I'm off.

1122
01:47:16,663 --> 01:47:18,162
Day after tomorrow.

1123
01:47:18,705 --> 01:47:19,704
Africa.

1124
01:47:20,163 --> 01:47:21,287
Oh.

1125
01:47:21,913 --> 01:47:23,079
So soon.

1126
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:26,204
Re-joining the regiment.

1127
01:47:28,538 --> 01:47:30,122
Of course.

1128
01:47:37,581 --> 01:47:38,663
Cheerio.

1129
01:47:40,248 --> 01:47:41,913
I will keep in touch.

1130
01:47:43,414 --> 01:47:44,580
Fratris.

1131
01:47:45,248 --> 01:47:46,456
Brother-in-law.

1132
01:47:46,999 --> 01:47:48,873
- Greek.
- Latin.

1133
01:47:48,915 --> 01:47:49,873
Squelch.

1134
01:47:55,582 --> 01:47:58,123
It's been splendid
knowing you.

1135
01:47:58,832 --> 01:48:01,039
I feel I've touched history.

1136
01:48:02,249 --> 01:48:04,790
Well... sort of hung on.

1137
01:48:10,583 --> 01:48:11,999
Maurice...

1138
01:48:16,208 --> 01:48:17,832
What have we done?

1139
01:49:14,712 --> 01:49:16,044
Mrs Eliot?

1140
01:49:16,754 --> 01:49:18,669
Hi, I'm Captain Todd.

1141
01:49:18,712 --> 01:49:21,961
I believe you know Mr Davis,
from the border control?

1142
01:49:22,004 --> 01:49:24,711
- Yes, hello.
- Hello, Mrs Eliot.

1143
01:49:25,420 --> 01:49:27,712
- You're an American.
- That's right.

1144
01:49:27,755 --> 01:49:31,587
Seconded by my unit to the
Tavistock Clinic as an observer.

1145
01:49:31,630 --> 01:49:35,045
I've looking at your case history,
I was wondering if we could

1146
01:49:35,088 --> 01:49:37,170
go over a few
things together?

1147
01:49:38,588 --> 01:49:39,962
Certainly.

1148
01:49:41,796 --> 01:49:44,671
Did any doctor ever mention
hormonal imbalance?

1149
01:49:45,422 --> 01:49:46,755
No.

1150
01:49:48,422 --> 01:49:50,505
When did menopause occur?

1151
01:49:51,464 --> 01:49:53,088
Seven years ago.

1152
01:49:53,714 --> 01:49:56,046
And since that time,
you've had pretty good health?

1153
01:49:56,089 --> 01:49:59,463
I have, remarkably, yes.

1154
01:50:02,048 --> 01:50:05,731
This treatment you had, I mean...
all there is,

1155
01:50:05,975 --> 01:50:10,423
is this history of headaches, followed by
stomach pains and menstrual bleeding.

1156
01:50:10,715 --> 01:50:15,506
Yes, I suppose you could sum up a quarter
of a century of frightfulness in that way.

1157
01:50:16,423 --> 01:50:20,048
You see today there are courses of
hormone treatment to maintain the uterus.

1158
01:50:20,091 --> 01:50:22,382
it's relatively simple.

1159
01:50:24,591 --> 01:50:25,882
Really?

1160
01:50:33,508 --> 01:50:36,049
You're legally separated
from your husband?

1161
01:50:38,092 --> 01:50:40,466
I'm sorry to say that's true.

1162
01:50:41,134 --> 01:50:42,341
Look, Ma'am...

1163
01:50:42,384 --> 01:50:44,633
I'm not too acquainted
with British law

1164
01:50:44,675 --> 01:50:47,129
but I understand your
husband is a Trustee of

1165
01:50:47,210 --> 01:50:49,949
your estate and has
control over your money.

1166
01:50:49,984 --> 01:50:51,379
Is that right?

1167
01:50:51,925 --> 01:50:54,009
I mean,
could you clarify that?

1168
01:50:55,343 --> 01:50:59,300
I have no intention of clarifying anything,
I don't know what you're insinuating.

1169
01:50:59,343 --> 01:51:02,717
Well it seems to me that you're paying
for your own incarceration here.

1170
01:51:03,593 --> 01:51:06,259
I mean are you trying to say
that in all these years

1171
01:51:06,301 --> 01:51:09,051
no-one has ever made an
application for your release?

1172
01:51:09,094 --> 01:51:12,301
No member of your family,
no Trustee?

1173
01:51:12,344 --> 01:51:14,593
How dare you?

1174
01:51:14,636 --> 01:51:17,468
My husband is the
sweetest man on earth.

1175
01:51:18,219 --> 01:51:22,218
He had borne the most awful lies
and vilification with absolute courage

1176
01:51:22,261 --> 01:51:25,635
he belongs with Kings,
covered in raiment.

1177
01:51:25,677 --> 01:51:26,886
Look, excuse me...

1178
01:51:26,928 --> 01:51:30,969
T.S. Eliot is the greatest living
poet in the English language.

1179
01:51:31,012 --> 01:51:33,469
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
I've never heard of T.S. Eliot.

1180
01:51:33,512 --> 01:51:35,802
And you won't
belittle me that way.

1181
01:51:35,845 --> 01:51:38,136
I gave Tom the title
to The Wasteland.

1182
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:41,594
We worked together,
side by side for 15 years

1183
01:51:41,637 --> 01:51:45,137
I am threaded through every line
of poetry he has ever written!

1184
01:51:45,179 --> 01:51:47,178
And he has my undying love.

1185
01:51:47,929 --> 01:51:50,928
He will have it until the
last breath leaves my body.

1186
01:51:51,763 --> 01:51:53,387
And he knows it.

1187
01:51:54,346 --> 01:51:56,970
And nobody can ever
take that away.

1188
01:52:05,805 --> 01:52:10,804
"The rending pain of re-enactment
of all that you have done...

1189
01:52:10,847 --> 01:52:12,929
...and been.

1190
01:52:12,972 --> 01:52:18,805
the shame of motives late revealed
and the awareness of things ill-done

1191
01:52:18,848 --> 01:52:20,847
and done to others' harm

1192
01:52:21,765 --> 01:52:25,389
which once you took
for exercise of virtue.

1193
01:52:26,890 --> 01:52:30,180
Then fools' approval stings

1194
01:52:30,223 --> 01:52:32,680
and honour stains

1195
01:52:32,723 --> 01:52:36,848
from wrong to wrong,
the exasperated spirit proceeds.

1196
01:52:37,807 --> 01:52:38,973
Unless...

1197
01:52:39,807 --> 01:52:43,098
...restored by that refining fire. "

1198
01:52:44,349 --> 01:52:48,765
"Where you must move in measure,
like a dancer. "

1199
01:52:53,267 --> 01:52:55,432
This is the National Program.

1200
01:52:59,267 --> 01:53:01,807
- We now present,
what is in effect... - Tom!

1201
01:53:03,850 --> 01:53:05,224
Tom!

1202
01:53:14,351 --> 01:53:17,475
Ah, Tom,
how good to see you!

1203
01:53:17,518 --> 01:53:19,267
Hello, Bertie.

1204
01:53:19,309 --> 01:53:21,350
How are you and
what are you doing?

1205
01:53:21,393 --> 01:53:23,142
- Cheerio.
- Bye.

1206
01:53:23,184 --> 01:53:25,893
Normal things, for a poet.

1207
01:53:25,935 --> 01:53:29,059
Watching enemy planes,
avoiding bombs...

1208
01:53:29,102 --> 01:53:31,809
...checking the blackouts.
And you Bertie?

1209
01:53:31,852 --> 01:53:33,434
I heard about Viv.

1210
01:53:34,810 --> 01:53:36,976
I suppose there was
no other solution.

1211
01:53:40,602 --> 01:53:43,602
Of course,
she was always unstable.

1212
01:53:44,395 --> 01:53:47,852
- You used to say she was
a free spirit. - Did I?

1213
01:53:49,186 --> 01:53:51,019
I don't recall.

1214
01:53:56,561 --> 01:53:58,895
Don't think it doesn't hurt.

1215
01:53:59,771 --> 01:54:02,061
She's with me all the time

1216
01:54:02,646 --> 01:54:04,645
every minute of the day.

1217
01:54:18,063 --> 01:54:20,187
Ah, my stop.

1218
01:54:23,397 --> 01:54:25,937
- Goodbye, Bertie.
- Goodbye.

1219
01:54:28,188 --> 01:54:30,062
She is well, Tom?

1220
01:54:32,689 --> 01:54:35,230
You have no right
to ask that.

1221
01:54:39,481 --> 01:54:40,688
Tom?

1222
01:55:11,483 --> 01:55:13,857
There's a visitor for you, Mrs Eliot.

1223
01:55:46,027 --> 01:55:46,901
Vivvie...

1224
01:55:47,485 --> 01:55:49,317
Hello, Maurice.

1225
01:55:52,193 --> 01:55:53,151
God...

1226
01:55:56,068 --> 01:55:57,818
You look so fit.

1227
01:55:57,861 --> 01:55:59,318
That's Africa.

1228
01:56:02,278 --> 01:56:04,193
Ooh, tea.

1229
01:56:05,111 --> 01:56:07,027
I'll move these.

1230
01:56:07,444 --> 01:56:08,902
There you are.

1231
01:56:12,903 --> 01:56:15,778
Well, looks pretty ace here.

1232
01:56:16,737 --> 01:56:18,111
It is.

1233
01:56:18,820 --> 01:56:22,861
- They're looking after you well?
- Oh, five star.

1234
01:56:22,904 --> 01:56:24,403
That's the spirit.

1235
01:56:28,695 --> 01:56:30,279
How was Africa?

1236
01:56:30,905 --> 01:56:32,487
Not bad.

1237
01:56:32,530 --> 01:56:34,820
Uh, saw off a few U-boats.

1238
01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:37,779
Gin is a bit difficult
to come by.

1239
01:56:39,696 --> 01:56:41,945
They appointed me
chief of police, Lagos.

1240
01:56:43,196 --> 01:56:44,362
Hurrah!

1241
01:56:44,988 --> 01:56:46,654
Had to give it up, though.

1242
01:56:47,781 --> 01:56:49,946
Hit a bit of a bald patch.

1243
01:56:51,239 --> 01:56:54,321
High commission wanted
this victory parade

1244
01:56:54,364 --> 01:56:57,488
so we held a sunset
curfew the night before

1245
01:56:57,531 --> 01:57:00,196
rounded up every dark blighter
we found on the streets

1246
01:57:00,239 --> 01:57:02,905
and popped them over to the chief
magistrate's court the next morning.

1247
01:57:03,781 --> 01:57:05,531
No chief magistrate.

1248
01:57:05,907 --> 01:57:08,697
I'd locked the rascal
up with all the others.

1249
01:57:10,615 --> 01:57:12,364
Red faces all round.

1250
01:57:22,908 --> 01:57:24,198
Dear old Vivvie.

1251
01:57:26,449 --> 01:57:28,157
I want to know how you are.

1252
01:57:29,033 --> 01:57:31,032
How it's all gone.

1253
01:57:32,699 --> 01:57:34,615
- Pretty quiet.
- Really?

1254
01:57:36,033 --> 01:57:38,408
Must have had
masses of visitors.

1255
01:57:38,450 --> 01:57:40,324
Celebs from the book world.

1256
01:57:41,242 --> 01:57:42,533
Not masses.

1257
01:57:43,825 --> 01:57:45,949
I mean, you do see chums?

1258
01:57:47,617 --> 01:57:49,741
Chums drop by?

1259
01:57:52,034 --> 01:57:54,700
You're the first "chum" I've
seen since Mummy died.

1260
01:57:55,993 --> 01:57:57,117
Ah.

1261
01:58:00,201 --> 01:58:02,117
But there's still old Tom.

1262
01:58:04,701 --> 01:58:06,159
Yes.

1263
01:58:06,910 --> 01:58:09,534
Well, he must write,
sort of thing?

1264
01:58:11,285 --> 01:58:13,826
I haven't heard from
Tom in 10 years.

1265
01:58:17,911 --> 01:58:19,951
But you are alright?

1266
01:58:20,661 --> 01:58:23,535
I mean, you seem so okay.

1267
01:58:23,911 --> 01:58:25,743
I'm as sane
as you are, Maurice.

1268
01:58:27,327 --> 01:58:29,911
Which may not amount to much,
God knows, but...

1269
01:58:30,953 --> 01:58:33,369
Ah, squelch.

1270
01:58:42,037 --> 01:58:43,244
I've learned to cook.

1271
01:58:47,704 --> 01:58:49,370
Wait here.

1272
01:59:21,706 --> 01:59:23,914
I want you to
give this to Tom.

1273
01:59:25,123 --> 01:59:27,872
It's his favourite,
chocolate fudge.

1274
01:59:27,915 --> 01:59:29,830
You know how he
loves chocolate.

1275
01:59:31,706 --> 01:59:34,789
I've really no idea when I'll see him,
I can't promise.

1276
01:59:35,665 --> 01:59:37,290
But when you do.

1277
01:59:40,332 --> 01:59:41,748
Yes.

1278
01:59:41,791 --> 01:59:43,915
Bound to bump into him,
of course.

1279
01:59:44,916 --> 01:59:46,623
I have to go now, Maurice.

1280
01:59:46,666 --> 01:59:48,748
I don't want to miss supper.

1281
01:59:50,749 --> 01:59:52,623
Bye, Maurice.

1282
02:00:01,250 --> 02:00:02,726
Chin up.

1283
02:00:50,333 --> 02:00:51,457
Maurice!

1284
02:02:00,468 --> 02:02:06,363
