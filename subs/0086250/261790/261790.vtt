660
00:49:04.961 --> 00:49:06.895
No, but l'm bored.

661
00:49:07.964 --> 00:49:09.989
Well, that figures.

662
00:49:11.768 --> 00:49:15.204
- Hey, check it out, Manny, okay?
And pay the guy.
- Yeah.

663
00:49:15.271 --> 00:49:18.832
And, uh, you take a taxi.
Meet me at the track, okay?

664
00:49:18.908 --> 00:49:21.604
- Good doin' business with you.
- Mr. Montana.

665
00:49:21.678 --> 00:49:23.612
Oh, God!

666
00:49:25.815 --> 00:49:28.283
l wouldn't buy the car
if you didn't like it.

667
00:49:28.351 --> 00:49:31.149
Plannin' on driving the girls crazy,
aren't you, Tony?

668
00:49:31.221 --> 00:49:33.712
Oh, yeah.
You know who?

669
00:49:35.525 --> 00:49:38.085
And what would Frank say?

670
00:49:39.662 --> 00:49:41.926
l like Frank, you know?

671
00:49:41.998 --> 00:49:44.432
Only l like you better.

672
00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:50.061
[Snorting]

673
00:49:51.574 --> 00:49:53.906
- You got some for me?
- Sure.

674
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:02.684
- [Tapping]
- Okay.

675
00:50:02.752 --> 00:50:04.913
[Snorting]

676
00:50:08.324 --> 00:50:10.258
- [Mutters]
- Okay.

677
00:50:11.995 --> 00:50:16.796
Don't get confused, Tony.
l don't fuck around with the help.

678
00:50:22.639 --> 00:50:24.539
Okay.

679
00:50:24.607 --> 00:50:28.270
You wanna play that way with me,
l play with you.

680
00:50:28.344 --> 00:50:30.278
Shit.

681
00:50:30.346 --> 00:50:33.577
- Would you kiss me if l wear the hat?
- No!

682
00:50:35.485 --> 00:50:38.147
Playtime is over, okay?
[Laughing]

683
00:50:39.989 --> 00:50:41.980
Okay.

684
00:51:21.664 --> 00:51:23.791
[Knocking]

685
00:51:35.111 --> 00:51:36.806
Mamá.

686
00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:39.644
Antonio.

687
00:51:39.716 --> 00:51:41.650
Long time.

688
00:51:43.553 --> 00:51:45.487
No postcards from jail?

689
00:51:54.898 --> 00:51:56.866
¡Coño! Gina.

690
00:51:58.568 --> 00:51:59.967
[Gasps]
Tony?

691
00:52:00.036 --> 00:52:03.904
- Oh, man, look at you. [Chuckles]
- [Laughs]

692
00:52:03.973 --> 00:52:06.134
Hey, you're beautiful.

693
00:52:06.209 --> 00:52:08.973
- l didn't--
- Mamá, look at those eyes, huh?

694
00:52:09.045 --> 00:52:12.208
- Look at that. She looks like me.
- [Chuckles]

695
00:52:12.282 --> 00:52:15.251
You know the last time l saw you,
you was like that.

696
00:52:15.318 --> 00:52:17.479
You looked like a little boy.

697
00:52:17.553 --> 00:52:20.044
But now look at you.

698
00:52:22.292 --> 00:52:24.783
Uh, l got something for you.

699
00:52:25.862 --> 00:52:28.524
[Exhales Deeply]

700
00:52:28.598 --> 00:52:31.123
For you.
This no big deal.

701
00:52:33.336 --> 00:52:36.396
Oh, Tony!
[Crying]

702
00:52:43.746 --> 00:52:46.237
- [Laughs]
- Oooh, Tony!

703
00:52:46.316 --> 00:52:48.784
l never thought
l'd see you again, you know?

704
00:52:48.851 --> 00:52:51.251
You think they're gonna keep
a guy like me down?

705
00:52:51.321 --> 00:52:53.812
Well, no.
[Laughs] No.

706
00:52:56.092 --> 00:52:58.253
[Sighs]
You look so good.

707
00:52:58.328 --> 00:53:02.424
Look. You open that up.
Open it.

708
00:53:02.498 --> 00:53:04.762
- For me?
- l think so.

709
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:09.630
lt's nothing much,
you know. Nothing.

710
00:53:10.707 --> 00:53:13.301
- [Sighs]
- See?

711
00:53:13.376 --> 00:53:15.310
Do you see what's written
on the back?

712
00:53:15.378 --> 00:53:19.109
On the back?
[Sighs]

713
00:53:19.182 --> 00:53:23.118
- ''Always.''
- ''Always.'' lt's beautiful, Tony!

714
00:53:24.721 --> 00:53:27.019
So Mamá is still working
in the factory,

715
00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:29.354
and l'm working part-time
in a beauty parlor.

716
00:53:29.425 --> 00:53:32.292
l'm doing hair, Tony.
Do you remember Hiram González?

717
00:53:32.362 --> 00:53:35.160
His father owned that barbershop.
lt's his place.

718
00:53:35.231 --> 00:53:37.893
Plus l go to junior college.
Miami Dade.

719
00:53:37.967 --> 00:53:41.130
And in two more years,
l get my cosmetology license.

720
00:53:41.204 --> 00:53:44.970
- And then l'll be making enough money--
- Surprise!

721
00:53:45.041 --> 00:53:48.636
All that's over...
starting today.

722
00:53:48.711 --> 00:53:53.239
- Why?
- My kid sister don't have to work
in no beauty parlor,

723
00:53:53.316 --> 00:53:57.377
and Mamá, she don't have to sew
in no factory.

724
00:53:57.453 --> 00:53:59.819
Your son made it, Mamá.

725
00:54:00.823 --> 00:54:03.257
He's a success.

726
00:54:03.326 --> 00:54:06.625
That's why l didn't
come around before.

727
00:54:06.696 --> 00:54:11.099
l want you to see
what a good boy l been.

728
00:54:13.036 --> 00:54:15.231
Here's a thousand dollars.

729
00:54:15.304 --> 00:54:17.829
For you, Mamá.

730
00:54:17.907 --> 00:54:19.841
[Clears Throat]

731
00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:27.378
- Who did you kill for this, Antonio?
- Mamá.

732
00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:30.283
l didn't kill nobody, Mamá.

733
00:54:30.353 --> 00:54:32.651
- No?
- No.

734
00:54:32.722 --> 00:54:35.122
What are you doing now?

735
00:54:35.191 --> 00:54:38.319
Banks, or is it still bodegas,
you and the others?

736
00:54:38.394 --> 00:54:40.794
No! Things are different now.

737
00:54:40.863 --> 00:54:43.923
l'm working
with an anti-Castro group.

738
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:48.198
l'm an organizer now, and l get
a lot of political contributions.

739
00:54:48.271 --> 00:54:50.535
Sure you do.

740
00:54:55.211 --> 00:54:58.408
A gun sticking
in somebody's face is how.

741
00:54:59.749 --> 00:55:04.209
You know, all we hear about
in the papers...

742
00:55:04.287 --> 00:55:08.747
is animals like you
and the killings.

743
00:55:08.825 --> 00:55:11.726
lt's Cubans like you who are giving
a bad name to our people.

744
00:55:11.794 --> 00:55:15.161
People who come here, work hard
and make a good name for themselves.

745
00:55:15.231 --> 00:55:17.927
- People who send
their children to school--
- Mamá! What are you saying?

746
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.525
- That's your son!
- [Shouts] Son?

747
00:55:20.603 --> 00:55:23.800
- l wish l had one. He's a bum.
- No. No.

748
00:55:23.873 --> 00:55:27.309
He was a bum then,
and he's a bum now.

749
00:55:28.811 --> 00:55:33.077
Who do you think
you are, hmm?

750
00:55:33.149 --> 00:55:36.550
We haven't heard a word
from you in five years.

751
00:55:36.619 --> 00:55:39.144
Cinco años.

752
00:55:39.222 --> 00:55:42.157
You suddenly show up here,
throw some money around...

753
00:55:42.225 --> 00:55:44.921
and think you can get
my respect.

754
00:55:44.994 --> 00:55:47.986
-You think you can buy me with jewelry?
-Come on, Mamá.

755
00:55:48.064 --> 00:55:51.397
You think you can come into my house
with your hotshot clothes...

756
00:55:51.467 --> 00:55:53.765
and your jail manners
and make fun of us?

757
00:55:53.836 --> 00:55:58.273
- Mamá, you don't know
what you're talking about.
- That's not the way l am!

758
00:55:58.341 --> 00:56:02.801
That is not the way
l raised Gina to be!

759
00:56:02.879 --> 00:56:07.043
You are not going
to destroy her.

760
00:56:07.116 --> 00:56:10.950
l don't need your money.
Gracias.

761
00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:13.352
l work for my living.

762
00:56:13.422 --> 00:56:16.357
l don't want you
in this house anymore!

763
00:56:16.425 --> 00:56:19.360
l don't want you around Gina.

764
00:56:19.428 --> 00:56:22.090
So, come on. Get out!

765
00:56:27.336 --> 00:56:29.600
Okay.

766
00:56:32.475 --> 00:56:36.377
- No. Mamá--
- And take this lousy money with you.

767
00:56:36.445 --> 00:56:38.936
- lt stinks.
- Tony--

768
00:56:40.716 --> 00:56:44.117
Why do you have to spoil it
for everybody, huh?

769
00:56:46.122 --> 00:56:49.387
l'm sorry, Tony.

770
00:56:49.458 --> 00:56:51.892
Okay, Mamá.

771
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:56.921
Oh, no, no.
Tony, wait a minute!

772
00:56:56.999 --> 00:56:59.126
- Don't go, please!
- Gina, stay here!

773
00:56:59.235 --> 00:57:02.602
- [Gina] No, no, no, Mamá--
- [Mamá] He's no good. Gina!

774
00:57:02.672 --> 00:57:05.106
- Tony, wait, please!
- Gina!

775
00:57:05.174 --> 00:57:09.543
l'm sorry. l don't know, Mamá--
Ever since Papá left she's--

776
00:57:09.612 --> 00:57:12.376
Forget Papá.
We never had one.

777
00:57:12.448 --> 00:57:15.178
l know you did
some bad things back then.

778
00:57:15.251 --> 00:57:18.118
ln the army, l know
you got into some trouble.

779
00:57:18.187 --> 00:57:20.917
The Communists, they're always trying
to tell you what to do.

780
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:24.050
- Mamá doesn't understand that.
- l know.

781
00:57:26.095 --> 00:57:30.896
l just-- l don't know. l just want you
to know, you know, l don't care.

782
00:57:30.967 --> 00:57:35.267
lt doesn't matter to me how long
you've been away, five or ten years.

783
00:57:37.406 --> 00:57:40.807
You're my blood, always.

784
00:57:42.044 --> 00:57:44.444
l know. l know.

785
00:57:53.623 --> 00:57:56.956
- Come on. Come on.
l want you to take this.
- l gotta go back in.

786
00:57:57.026 --> 00:57:59.688
- No, Tony. Please. Tony.
- You need this. Come on.

787
00:57:59.762 --> 00:58:03.163
- What am l gonna tell her?
- Take that. You don't
tell her anything.

788
00:58:03.232 --> 00:58:06.497
Don't tell her l give it to you,
but give her some from time to time.

789
00:58:06.569 --> 00:58:09.333
And listen, you go out yourself,
you know?

790
00:58:09.405 --> 00:58:12.897
Go ahead, go out, do some things.
Have some fun.

791
00:58:12.975 --> 00:58:15.409
You gotta get some fun
out of life.

792
00:58:15.478 --> 00:58:20.279
You gonna beat yourself to death at 19?
Pussycat like you?

793
00:58:20.349 --> 00:58:22.681
- Come here.
- Mmm.

794
00:58:24.453 --> 00:58:26.683
- l'll talk to you again, all right?
- Okay.

795
00:58:26.756 --> 00:58:30.385
- Put that money away.
Don't let her see it.
- l'll talk to her.

796
00:58:30.459 --> 00:58:33.257
- Okay. l'll talk to you.
- [Train Whistle Blowing]

797
00:58:33.329 --> 00:58:35.593
Okay.

798
00:58:35.665 --> 00:58:38.429
Okay, let's go.

799
00:58:38.501 --> 00:58:40.435
She's beautiful.

800
00:58:40.503 --> 00:58:43.336
- How come you--
- Hey!

801
00:58:43.406 --> 00:58:48.002
Stay away from her, man.
You hear?

802
00:58:48.077 --> 00:58:51.774
- She not for you.
- Okay.

803
00:59:17.239 --> 00:59:20.572
So this and my other factory,
l can guarantee production...

804
00:59:20.643 --> 00:59:24.773
of 200 kilos refined
every month of the year.

805
00:59:24.847 --> 00:59:27.042
The problem is
l have no steady market.

806
00:59:27.116 --> 00:59:30.574
Basically, what l'm looking for
is somebody in the States...

807
00:59:30.653 --> 00:59:33.315
who can share the risk with me,

808
00:59:33.389 --> 00:59:38.417
somebody who can guarantee
to buy from me, say, 150 kilos a month.

809
00:59:38.494 --> 00:59:41.725
Oh! That's a big commitment,
Mr. Sosa.

810
00:59:41.797 --> 00:59:44.061
Something like that, uh--

811
00:59:44.133 --> 00:59:47.068
lt's too bad Frank's not here.
You should talk to him.

812
00:59:47.136 --> 00:59:50.333
- lt would've been nice
if he could have come.
- He would like to come,

813
00:59:50.406 --> 00:59:54.342
but with his trial coming up, it's hard
for him to get out of the country.

814
00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:58.039
- So he sent you instead?
- Yeah, something like that.

815
00:59:58.114 --> 01:00:00.844
We'll talk at my house,
shall we?

816
01:00:00.916 --> 01:00:04.317
You got good stuff here.
Class 'A' shit.

817
01:00:26.342 --> 01:00:31.177
So this López guarantees to buy from me
150 kilos every month of the year.

818
01:00:31.247 --> 01:00:33.306
He picks it up here.

819
01:00:33.382 --> 01:00:38.149
l can sell it to him for as little as,
uh... 7,000 a key.

820
01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:41.121
You cannot do better than that.

821
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:44.591
Yeah, but then we gotta
take the risk of moving it.

822
01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:47.493
Also, we'll be cutting out the
Colombians. You know what that means?

823
01:00:47.563 --> 01:00:49.554
That means we have
to go to war with them.

824
01:00:49.632 --> 01:00:52.897
We cut out the Colombians,
we take risks on both sides.

825
01:00:52.968 --> 01:00:56.460
Why don't we split the risk?

826
01:00:56.539 --> 01:01:00.839
You guarantee your delivery,
say, as far as Panama.

827
01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:03.572
We take it from there.

828
01:01:05.014 --> 01:01:07.073
Panama is risky.

829
01:01:07.149 --> 01:01:09.947
lt costs me more.

830
01:01:10.019 --> 01:01:12.749
Panama l can sell for...

831
01:01:12.822 --> 01:01:14.756
13.5 a key.

832
01:01:14.824 --> 01:01:17.759
13.5?
What, are you nuts?

833
01:01:19.662 --> 01:01:23.428
13.5? We still gotta take
that shit to Florida, man.

834
01:01:23.499 --> 01:01:27.799
Do you know what that's like
these days? You got the fucking navy.

835
01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:32.637
You got frogmen. You got EC-2s
with the satellite-tracking shit.

836
01:01:32.708 --> 01:01:35.973
You got the fucking
Bell 209 assault choppers up the ass.

837
01:01:36.045 --> 01:01:39.139
We're losing one
out of every nine loads.

838
01:01:39.215 --> 01:01:42.810
That's no duck walk anymore, man,
let me tell you.

839
01:01:42.885 --> 01:01:44.944
Forget about 13.5.

840
01:01:46.088 --> 01:01:48.079
- [Phone Ringing]
- Well,

841
01:01:48.157 --> 01:01:50.717
what do you suggest
that is reasonable?

842
01:01:50.793 --> 01:01:53.023
[Ringing Continues]

843
01:01:55.798 --> 01:01:58.062
Excuse me one moment.

844
01:02:03.005 --> 01:02:05.599
Hey, Montana, what the fuck's
the matter with you?

845
01:02:05.674 --> 01:02:08.268
- You negotiating for Frank López, huh?
- Don't worry about it.

846
01:02:08.344 --> 01:02:11.472
- Take it easy.
- l'm not worried about it.

847
01:02:11.547 --> 01:02:15.142
You should worry about it. lf he wants
to make a deal, it's up to him, not you.

848
01:02:15.217 --> 01:02:18.778
- We're gonna do
this one deal. That's it.
- Fuck you. How's that?

849
01:02:20.556 --> 01:02:22.524
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

850
01:02:22.591 --> 01:02:25.458
[Omar] You need to open your eyes
and keep your mouth shut.

851
01:02:25.528 --> 01:02:28.725
- That's it. Let it go at that.
- Don't worry about it.

852
01:02:28.797 --> 01:02:31.425
Your head is in the wrong place.
You got to watch out for yourself.

853
01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:34.901
Why don't you talk to him
about it? You think he
wants to give you the money?

854
01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:39.600
- Shut the fuck up.
- l'm doing the talking here, not you.

855
01:02:39.675 --> 01:02:43.702
You're here to watch my back.
Watch my back.

856
01:02:43.779 --> 01:02:47.180
Better than your front, let me tell you.
That's easier to watch.

857
01:02:47.249 --> 01:02:49.183
[Omar]
Close your mouth.

858
01:02:49.251 --> 01:02:52.948
l can't wait to see what Frank's
gonna react to this one.

859
01:02:53.022 --> 01:02:56.822
Just shut up.
l'm doing the talking here.

860
01:02:56.892 --> 01:02:59.326
- Now where were we?
- Panama.

861
01:02:59.395 --> 01:03:01.829
You're looking
for a partner, right?

862
01:03:02.932 --> 01:03:04.866
Something like that.

863
01:03:04.934 --> 01:03:09.132
Look, Mr. Sosa,
we're getting ahead of ourselves here.

864
01:03:09.204 --> 01:03:13.573
l am down on Frank's authority
to buy 200 keys, that's it.

865
01:03:13.642 --> 01:03:16.076
That's my limit.
l got no right--

866
01:03:16.145 --> 01:03:19.273
- Nobody got no right
to negotiate for Frank--
- Let the man finish, okay?

867
01:03:19.348 --> 01:03:22.317
Let him propose a proposition;
then we can talk more.

868
01:03:22.384 --> 01:03:24.409
You got no authority here.

869
01:03:24.486 --> 01:03:27.216
l started you in this fucking business,
so shut the fuck up.

870
01:03:27.289 --> 01:03:30.986
- Frank is gonna love it.
Don't worry about it.
- That's up to Frank, not you!

871
01:03:34.463 --> 01:03:36.488
l'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa.

872
01:03:36.565 --> 01:03:39.090
No, it is all right.

873
01:03:39.168 --> 01:03:42.626
You're right.
Maybe you should talk to Frank.

874
01:03:45.274 --> 01:03:47.640
Well, good.

875
01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:51.009
l don't think it's something
l wanna do on an overseas phone.

876
01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:56.177
But as soon as l get back to Miami,
l will talk to Frank personally.

877
01:03:56.251 --> 01:03:58.583
Good.

878
01:03:58.654 --> 01:04:01.487
My associates here
can escort you to my chopper.

879
01:04:01.557 --> 01:04:04.025
My chopper can take you
to Santa Cruz.

880
01:04:04.093 --> 01:04:07.085
l have a jet there,
can have you in Miami in five hours.

881
01:04:07.162 --> 01:04:09.426
You should be back here tomorrow
in time for lunch.

882
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.434
Good. Good. Good.

883
01:04:12.434 --> 01:04:13.696
Good. Good. Good.

884
01:04:13.769 --> 01:04:16.033
Hasta mañana.

885
01:04:16.105 --> 01:04:18.596
Good talking to you.

886
01:04:18.674 --> 01:04:21.268
Why don't you leave
your friend here?

887
01:04:21.343 --> 01:04:24.107
While you are gone, maybe he can
tell me how to run my business.

888
01:04:24.179 --> 01:04:26.977
- l think Frank would like to see him--
- No, that's okay.

889
01:04:27.049 --> 01:04:30.348
You tell Frank l keeping
this guy on ice for him.

[Sosa]
Let's finish our lunch.

893
01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:47.901
l have to hand it
to you, Mr. Sosa.

894
01:04:47.970 --> 01:04:51.030
You got everything
a man could want.

895
01:04:52.307 --> 01:04:56.641
l like you, Tony.
There is no lying in you.

896
01:04:56.712 --> 01:05:01.149
Unfortunately, l do not feel the same
about the rest of your organization.

897
01:05:01.216 --> 01:05:04.379
[Helicopter Whirring Overhead]

898
01:05:04.453 --> 01:05:07.422
What do you mean
by that, Mr. Sosa?

899
01:05:07.489 --> 01:05:09.923
l'm talking about Omar Suárez.

900
01:05:12.361 --> 01:05:16.354
- This garbage was recognized
by my associate at lunch...
- [Helicopter Whirring]

901
01:05:16.432 --> 01:05:20.698
from several years ago
in New York.

902
01:05:23.706 --> 01:05:26.800
He was an informer
for the police.

903
01:05:38.153 --> 01:05:40.348
[Omar Screaming]

904
01:05:42.591 --> 01:05:46.493
[Sosa] He put Vito Duval
and the Ramos brothers, Nello and Gino,

905
01:05:46.562 --> 01:05:49.395
away for life.

906
01:05:51.433 --> 01:05:55.267
So how do l know you're not
a chivato too, Tony?

907
01:05:58.373 --> 01:06:00.864
Hey, Sosa.

908
01:06:02.377 --> 01:06:06.211
Let's get this straight now.

909
01:06:06.281 --> 01:06:10.377
l never fucked anybody over in my life
didn't have it comin' to him.

910
01:06:10.452 --> 01:06:13.012
You got that?

911
01:06:13.088 --> 01:06:16.717
All l have in this life
is my balls and my word,

912
01:06:16.792 --> 01:06:21.354
and l don't break 'em for no one,
you understand?

913
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:25.833
That piece of shit up there,
l never like him, l never trusted him.

914
01:06:25.901 --> 01:06:30.167
For all l know, he had me set up and had
my friend, Ángel Fernández, killed.

915
01:06:30.239 --> 01:06:33.003
But that's history.
l'm here, he's not.

916
01:06:33.075 --> 01:06:35.635
You wanna go on with me, say it.

917
01:06:35.711 --> 01:06:38.077
You don't, then you make a move.

918
01:06:43.218 --> 01:06:45.982
l think you speak
from the heart, Montana.

919
01:06:46.054 --> 01:06:48.955
But l say to myself,

920
01:06:49.024 --> 01:06:52.050
this López, your boss,

921
01:06:52.127 --> 01:06:55.585
he had chivatos like that
working for him.

922
01:06:55.664 --> 01:06:58.098
His judgment stinks.

923
01:07:00.068 --> 01:07:04.971
So l think to myself, how many
other mistakes has this López guy made?

924
01:07:07.810 --> 01:07:10.711
How can l trust his organization?

925
01:07:10.779 --> 01:07:13.304
You tell me, Tony.

926
01:07:14.183 --> 01:07:16.845
Frank is smart, you know?

927
01:07:19.388 --> 01:07:22.915
You can't blame him
for that animal.

928
01:07:22.991 --> 01:07:25.926
lt's a crazy business we're in,
you know?

929
01:07:25.994 --> 01:07:28.622
That could happen to anyone,
even you.

930
01:07:35.070 --> 01:07:38.870
Why don't l go back
and talk to Frank...

931
01:07:38.941 --> 01:07:41.171
and work it out?

932
01:07:41.243 --> 01:07:43.677
l fix things between us.

933
01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:48.277
You got my word on it.

we can work this thing out,

Just remember--
l'll only tell you one time--

937
01:08:01.930 --> 01:08:04.364
don't fuck me, Tony.

938
01:08:06.635 --> 01:08:09.729
Don't you ever try to fuck me.

You what?

940
01:08:24.786 --> 01:08:28.620
You made a deal
for a fucking $18 million...

941
01:08:28.690 --> 01:08:30.851
without even checking with me?

942
01:08:30.926 --> 01:08:33.394
Are you crazy, Montana?
Are you crazy?

943
01:08:33.462 --> 01:08:35.555
- Coño, Frank. Take it easy.
- ¡Coño, my ass!

944
01:08:35.631 --> 01:08:38.225
At 10.5 a key, it's puro.

945
01:08:39.701 --> 01:08:42.534
You can't lose money.
No way.

946
01:08:44.072 --> 01:08:48.406
We make 75 million
on this deal, Frank.

947
01:08:48.477 --> 01:08:51.275
Seventy-five million.

948
01:08:51.346 --> 01:08:53.371
That is serious money.

949
01:08:53.448 --> 01:08:57.885
What the fuck is Sosa
going to do when l don't come up
with the first five million?

950
01:08:57.953 --> 01:09:01.480
What is he gonna do?
ls he gonna send me a bill?

951
01:09:01.556 --> 01:09:04.320
He's gonna send
a fucking hit squad up here!

952
01:09:04.393 --> 01:09:06.861
Relax! Take it easy.

953
01:09:06.929 --> 01:09:10.057
l'm in tight with Sosa.

954
01:09:10.132 --> 01:09:13.568
You short a couple of mil,
l go on the street for you.

955
01:09:13.635 --> 01:09:16.729
l make a couple of moves,

956
01:09:16.805 --> 01:09:19.467
a mil here, a mil there,
you got it.

957
01:09:19.541 --> 01:09:21.475
Okay?

958
01:09:23.378 --> 01:09:28.543
Oh, you've been making moves
on your own, huh?

959
01:09:28.617 --> 01:09:32.485
l got ears, you know?
l hear things.

960
01:09:32.554 --> 01:09:35.523
Yeah?

961
01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:38.582
What do you hear about Echevierra
and the Díaz brothers?

962
01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:42.824
What about Gaspar Gómez?
What is he gonna do when you
start moving 2,000 keys--

963
01:09:42.898 --> 01:09:46.857
Fuck Gaspar Gómez and fuck
the fucking Díaz brothers!

964
01:09:46.935 --> 01:09:49.563
Fuck 'em all!

965
01:09:49.638 --> 01:09:52.368
l bury those cockroaches!

966
01:09:52.441 --> 01:09:54.705
What they ever do for us?

967
01:10:02.784 --> 01:10:07.244
Look, Frank, the time has come.

968
01:10:07.322 --> 01:10:09.722
We gotta expand.

969
01:10:09.791 --> 01:10:13.887
The whole operation.
Distribution.

970
01:10:13.962 --> 01:10:17.830
New York, Chicago, L.A.

971
01:10:17.899 --> 01:10:22.302
We gotta set our own mark
and enforce it.

972
01:10:22.371 --> 01:10:24.862
We gotta think big now.

973
01:10:28.777 --> 01:10:31.211
Think big.

974
01:10:35.951 --> 01:10:37.919
Like your friend Sosa.

975
01:10:40.088 --> 01:10:43.546
Let me tell you something about
that greaseball cocksucker.

976
01:10:43.625 --> 01:10:46.150
He is a snake,
that's what he is.

977
01:10:48.463 --> 01:10:53.196
You turn your back on him,
he'll stick it in.

978
01:10:53.268 --> 01:10:56.726
You don't trust a guy like that.

979
01:10:56.805 --> 01:10:59.774
You want me to believe...

980
01:10:59.841 --> 01:11:04.210
Omar was a stoolie
because Sosa said so?

981
01:11:04.279 --> 01:11:07.009
You bought that line.

982
01:11:07.082 --> 01:11:10.210
Maybe l made a mistake
sending you down there.

983
01:11:11.553 --> 01:11:14.681
Maybe you and Sosa
know something l don't know.

984
01:11:17.259 --> 01:11:19.227
Like what?

985
01:11:19.294 --> 01:11:21.819
Like what?

986
01:11:21.897 --> 01:11:24.764
[Chuckling]
You tell me like what?

987
01:11:29.538 --> 01:11:33.099
You calling me a liar, Frank?

988
01:11:33.175 --> 01:11:35.643
That what you calling me?

989
01:11:40.782 --> 01:11:44.513
Let's just say l want things
to stay the way they are for now.

990
01:11:47.956 --> 01:11:50.550

with 20 million
of your hard-earned dollars?

1479
01:48:31.509 --> 01:48:33.773
Come on, Tony.
Don't be a schmuck.

1480
01:48:33.845 --> 01:48:37.941
Who else can you trust? That's why
you pay us what you do. You trust us.

1481
01:48:38.016 --> 01:48:40.075
Huh?

1482
01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:46.848
Did you hear that guy? You gotta
listen to him. You'll learn something.

1483
01:48:46.925 --> 01:48:51.385
Stay with us. You're an old
and well-liked customer.
You're in good hands with us.

1484
01:48:54.199 --> 01:48:56.429
- And l gotta run.
- l'm safe but poor.

1485
01:48:58.136 --> 01:49:01.037
- How's married life treating you?
- Better than you are.

1486
01:49:01.106 --> 01:49:04.200
[Laughing] Say hello
to the princess for me, will you?

1487
01:49:04.275 --> 01:49:06.243
- She's beautiful.
- Okay.

1488
01:49:06.311 --> 01:49:09.246
- l'll see you. Take care.
- You too.

1489
01:49:15.220 --> 01:49:17.654
[Tony]
Come here.

1490
01:49:23.461 --> 01:49:26.157
That prick!

1491
01:49:26.231 --> 01:49:28.358
Fuckin' WASP whore.

1492
01:49:28.433 --> 01:49:32.767
Talkin' to me like l--
l some maricón come over on a boat.

1493
01:49:32.837 --> 01:49:34.828
l tell you what.

1494
01:49:34.906 --> 01:49:37.306
We don't need that
smilin' motherfucker.

1495
01:49:37.375 --> 01:49:41.209
We should talk to this Jewish guy,
Seidelbaum, okay?

1496
01:49:41.279 --> 01:49:46.740
He's got his own exchange.
He charges four percent at
the most. And he's connected.

1497
01:49:48.319 --> 01:49:50.014
Fuck 'em.

1498
01:49:50.088 --> 01:49:53.615
- Mob guys. Guineas.
- [Snorting]

1499
01:49:53.692 --> 01:49:56.024
l don't trust 'em.

1500
01:50:13.278 --> 01:50:16.145
Hey, Manny.
Did you sweep the house this month?

1501
01:50:16.214 --> 01:50:18.205
The cars?

1502
01:50:18.283 --> 01:50:22.913
Yeah. l told you about it.
The $5,000?

1503
01:50:22.987 --> 01:50:25.717
- Look at that.
- [Sniffs] What?

1504
01:50:25.790 --> 01:50:27.724
[Tony]
That cable truck there.

1505
01:50:27.792 --> 01:50:30.920
Since when does it take
three days to rig a cable?

1506
01:50:33.498 --> 01:50:36.058
What? You been watching it
for three days?

1507
01:50:38.002 --> 01:50:42.564
The fuckin' thing has been there
for three days? What am l
gonna do, not look at it?

1508
01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:45.871
- What, you think it's cops, right?
- l don't know.

1509
01:50:45.944 --> 01:50:49.311
Could be the Díaz brothers,
come to get me.

1510
01:50:51.082 --> 01:50:53.607
Maybe.
l'll check it out, okay?

1511
01:50:53.685 --> 01:50:57.781
You check it out. Then we're gonna blow
that fuckin' truck back to Colombia!

1512
01:50:58.690 --> 01:51:01.181
Come on, come on.
Monina.

1513
01:51:01.259 --> 01:51:04.524
We're not the only dopers living
on the block, okay? Remember that.

1514
01:51:04.596 --> 01:51:08.532
That fucking truck, that
could be anybody and anything.
lt could be a cable company--

1515
01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:11.592
You know something?
You got some fuckin' attitude.

1516
01:51:11.669 --> 01:51:14.137
For someone who's in charge
of my security--

1517
01:51:14.205 --> 01:51:19.142
Here. Here are the keys to
the front door. Go down there.
Give 'em the fuckin' keys!

1518
01:51:19.210 --> 01:51:21.235
- l'm just tryin' to say something.
- What?

1519
01:51:21.312 --> 01:51:25.442
- You're spending a lot of money
on this countersurveillance.
- l don't give a fuck.

1520
01:51:25.517 --> 01:51:29.647
lt's already twelve percent
of our adjusted gross.
Twelve percent is not peanuts.

1521
01:51:29.721 --> 01:51:33.714
l don't give a fuck! lt makes me sleep
good at night. That's what counts.

1522
01:51:33.792 --> 01:51:36.192
- Okay? You worry about it.
- l am worried about it.

1523
01:51:36.261 --> 01:51:39.424
l'm telling you.
We're getting sloppy.

1524
01:51:39.497 --> 01:51:43.092
Our thinking,
our fuckin' attitude, you know?

1525
01:51:43.168 --> 01:51:45.159
We're not fuckin' hungry anymore.

1526
01:51:45.236 --> 01:51:45.270
Miami's changing.
You can see it everywhere.

1527
01:51:45.270 --> 01:51:47.966
Miami's changing.
You can see it everywhere.

1528
01:51:48.039 --> 01:51:49.973
New construction.
New jobs.

1529
01:51:50.041 --> 01:51:52.908
Growth that's financed
by Florida Security Trust.

1530
01:51:52.977 --> 01:51:57.812
We've been putting your money
to work for 75 years building
a more prosperous Miami.

1531
01:51:57.882 --> 01:52:00.282
- Count on us being here tomorrow.
- [Tony] Oh, yeah?

1532
01:52:00.351 --> 01:52:03.252
That's because for 75 years
you been fuckin' everybody.

1533
01:52:03.321 --> 01:52:06.984
Somebody should do something
about these-- these whores.

1534
01:52:07.058 --> 01:52:09.322
l mean, chargin' me
ten points on my money.

1535
01:52:09.394 --> 01:52:14.229
They're gettin' away with it.
Fuck, there's no laws anymore.

1536
01:52:14.299 --> 01:52:16.233
- Forget it, man.
- l mean, anything goes.

1537
01:52:16.301 --> 01:52:20.362
They been around a thousand years.
They got all the angles figured out.

1538
01:52:20.438 --> 01:52:23.874
You know what capitalism is?
Gettin' fucked.

1539
01:52:23.942 --> 01:52:26.137
[Elvira]
True capitalist if ever l met one.

1540
01:52:26.211 --> 01:52:30.147
- [TV Shuts Off]
- Uh-oh. Did you hear that?

1541
01:52:30.215 --> 01:52:32.206
How would you know, bubblehead?

1542
01:52:32.283 --> 01:52:37.311
You ever do nothin' besides get
your hair fixed and powder your nose?

1543
01:52:37.388 --> 01:52:40.084
Look at it. You do too much
of that shit, you know?

1544
01:52:40.158 --> 01:52:42.626
Nothing exceeds like excess.

1545
01:52:42.694 --> 01:52:46.357
- You should know that, Tony.
- l should know what?

1546
01:52:46.431 --> 01:52:48.797
What should l know?

1547
01:52:48.867 --> 01:52:52.030
Why do you have to talk to me
like that all the time for?

1548
01:52:52.103 --> 01:52:55.231
- Like l gotta know something.
- Let me talk to you.

1549
01:52:55.306 --> 01:52:58.764
- Listen to me.
This Seidelbaum. Five to 7:00.
- What time is it?

1550
01:52:58.843 --> 01:53:01.676
- Okay.
- Okay?

1551
01:53:01.746 --> 01:53:05.079
- l met with this guy--
- The drug-related violence
that's plagued south Florida...

1552
01:53:05.149 --> 01:53:07.117
He's good for a laugh, this guy.

1553
01:53:07.185 --> 01:53:09.551
forces one to ask a question:

1554
01:53:09.621 --> 01:53:12.647
How, with a small law enforcement
budget, can you put a dent...

1555
01:53:12.724 --> 01:53:17.718
on an estimated
$100 billion-a-year business?

1556
01:53:17.795 --> 01:53:21.060
lt seems at times all you can do
is put your finger in the dike and pray.

1557
01:53:21.132 --> 01:53:23.464
Put your fingers in a dike?

1558
01:53:23.534 --> 01:53:28.062
The only place you can
get your fingers in some dyke.

1559
01:53:28.139 --> 01:53:33.668
Not by outlawing the substances,
but by legalizing and taxing them.

1560
01:53:33.745 --> 01:53:39.308
These voices say that will drive out
the organized crime element.

1561
01:53:39.384 --> 01:53:41.511
l am not one of those voices.

1562
01:53:41.586 --> 01:53:43.577
l know that.
But you know why, Vic?

1563
01:53:43.655 --> 01:53:46.590
'Cause you got your head
up your culo, that's why.

1564
01:53:46.658 --> 01:53:48.683
That fuckin' guy,
he never tells the truth.

1565
01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:52.423
...splendor of our city
at its best.

1566
01:53:52.497 --> 01:53:55.955
lt's those guys, man!
lt's the fuckin' bankers,
the politicians--

1567
01:53:56.034 --> 01:53:57.968
they're the ones
that wanna make coke illegal!

1568
01:53:58.036 --> 01:54:01.665
So they can make the fuckin' money,
and they get the fuckin' votes!

1569
01:54:01.739 --> 01:54:05.334
They fightin' the bad guys.
They're the bad guys!

1570
01:54:05.410 --> 01:54:07.344
They fuck anything and anyone--

1571
01:54:07.412 --> 01:54:10.677
Can't you stop saying ''fuck''
all the time?

1572
01:54:10.748 --> 01:54:13.683
Can't you stop talking about money?
lt's boring, Tony.

1573
01:54:13.751 --> 01:54:17.380
Where's this comin' from, man?
Boring? What's boring?

1574
01:54:17.455 --> 01:54:19.389
- You're boring.
- Oh.

1575
01:54:19.457 --> 01:54:23.120
Money, money, money, money, money.
That's all l ever hear in this house.

1576
01:54:23.194 --> 01:54:26.288
Manny, look at the pelican fly.
Come on, pelican!

1577
01:54:26.364 --> 01:54:29.026
- Here it is.
- Frank never talked about money.

1578
01:54:30.601 --> 01:54:33.263
Oh.

1579
01:54:33.338 --> 01:54:36.671
That's 'cause
he was so smart, you know?

1580
01:54:36.741 --> 01:54:38.675
[Tony Muttering]

1581
01:54:38.743 --> 01:54:41.837
Cuidado. Se te cae.

1582
01:54:41.913 --> 01:54:44.677
You know what
you're becoming, Tony?

1583
01:54:44.749 --> 01:54:47.081
You're an immigrant
spic millionaire...

1584
01:54:47.151 --> 01:54:49.085
who can't stop talking about
how much money he's got--

1585
01:54:49.153 --> 01:54:51.485
Who you callin' a spic,
you white piece of bread?

1586
01:54:51.556 --> 01:54:53.751
Get out of the way
of the television!

1587
01:54:53.825 --> 01:54:56.623
Why don't you dig a hole
in the garden and bury it?

1588
01:54:56.694 --> 01:55:00.095
l work hard for this!
l want you to know that.

1589
01:55:02.967 --> 01:55:07.028
lt's too bad.
Somebody should've given it to you.
You would've been a nicer person.

1590
01:55:07.105 --> 01:55:11.769
Oh. You know what
your problem is, pussycat?

1591
01:55:11.843 --> 01:55:14.073
What is my problem?

1592
01:55:14.145 --> 01:55:17.581
You got nothing to do
with your life.

1593
01:55:17.648 --> 01:55:20.776
Why don't you get a job
or something, you know?

1594
01:55:20.852 --> 01:55:23.753
Do something.
Be a nurse.

1595
01:55:23.821 --> 01:55:27.188
Work with blind kids, lepers.

1596
01:55:27.258 --> 01:55:31.627
Anything beats lying around all day
waitin' for me to fuck you!

1597
01:55:31.696 --> 01:55:34.688
Don't toot your horn, honey.
You're not that good.

1598
01:55:34.766 --> 01:55:36.893
Oh, no?
Frank was better, huh?

1599
01:55:38.469 --> 01:55:40.903
You're an asshole!

1600
01:55:40.972 --> 01:55:43.167
Where you going?
Come here!

1601
01:55:43.241 --> 01:55:47.371
Hey, Elvie!
l was kidding!

1602
01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:50.939
l was only kidding!

1603
01:55:51.015 --> 01:55:55.247
l guess sometimes married life is not
all it's cracked up to be, you know?

1604
01:55:55.319 --> 01:55:58.413
- Where you goin'?
- l got a date.

1605
01:55:58.489 --> 01:56:00.423
- You got a date?
- Yeah.

1606
01:56:00.491 --> 01:56:02.425
Come here.

1607
01:56:05.530 --> 01:56:08.328
- What?
- This Seidelbaum thing.

1608
01:56:08.399 --> 01:56:10.890
Yeah, it's all set up.

1609
01:56:10.968 --> 01:56:15.371
Yeah, well, you forget it.
Stay out of it. l take care of it.

1610
01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:18.705
''Stay out of it''?
lt's my deal. l set it up.

1611
01:56:18.776 --> 01:56:21.142
You're not a negotiator,
Manny, you know that.

1612
01:56:21.212 --> 01:56:24.147
You like the ladies more than you like
the money. That's your problem.

1613
01:56:24.215 --> 01:56:27.742
What the fuck are you talking about?
l'm your partner, okay?

1614
01:56:27.819 --> 01:56:31.516
You're not gonna trust me with that
kind of thing, who you gonna trust?

1615
01:56:31.589 --> 01:56:34.922
- Junior partner.
- Bullshit, man.

1616
01:56:34.992 --> 01:56:38.587
Hey, don't talk to me about trust.
l don't like it.

1617
01:56:38.663 --> 01:56:43.191
You should listen to your wife.
She's right. You are an asshole, man!

1618
01:56:43.267 --> 01:56:46.031
Come here. Gimme a kiss.
Come here.

1619
01:56:46.104 --> 01:56:50.063
Hey. Hey!
Fuck you, man!

1620
01:56:50.141 --> 01:56:54.737
Who put this thing together?
Me! That's who!

1621
01:56:54.812 --> 01:56:57.713
Who do l trust? Me!

1622
01:56:57.782 --> 01:57:00.250
Fuck him. Trust.

1623
01:57:00.318 --> 01:57:02.513
Por nada.

1624
01:57:02.587 --> 01:57:06.284
Asshole.
Fuck called me an asshole.

1625
01:57:06.357 --> 01:57:09.451
l need that shit.

1626
01:57:09.527 --> 01:57:12.928
l don't need him,
and l don't need her.

1627
01:57:12.997 --> 01:57:16.728
Fuck 'em.
l don't need nobody!

1628
01:57:16.801 --> 01:57:16.834
Back then l worked in pictures
down in Colombia.

1629
01:57:16.834 --> 01:57:19.632
Back then l worked in pictures
down in Colombia.

1630
01:57:19.704 --> 01:57:22.502
l was in that movie Burn.
You ever see it?

1631
01:57:22.573 --> 01:57:26.407
Ah, you saw me, with Marlon Brando.
You know, we're good friends.

1632
01:57:26.477 --> 01:57:28.911
- l was his driver.
- No shit?

1633
01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:32.416
- Brando, huh?
- Yeah, they shot it there.

But they're gonna come back at us

- lt can't be that bad.

Okay, now that's $800,000.

1702
02:02:04.121 --> 02:02:06.715
With that kind of money,
you can buy the Supreme Court.

1703
02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:14.363
Tony, the law has to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt.

1704

at raisin' that doubt.

that is of interest to all of us here.

You have a problem, Tony.

We... have a problem.

we can solve all our problems.

1731

We all know that you have
tax troubles in your country...

1732
02:04:13.050 --> 02:04:16.315
and that you may have
to do a little time.

1733
02:04:16.387 --> 02:04:21.017
But we have some friends
in Washington that assure us
these troubles can be taken care of.

You may have to pay
some back taxes, a big fine,

1735

but, uh,
there will be no prison.

l've heard whispers about financial
support your government receives...

1740
02:04:38.475 --> 02:04:40.409
from the drug industry
in Bolivia.

1741
02:04:40.477 --> 02:04:45.471
Well, the irony of this is that
this money, which is in the billions,

1742
02:04:45.549 --> 02:04:47.483
is coming from your country.

1743
02:04:47.551 --> 02:04:50.987
You are the major purchaser
of our national product,

1744
02:04:51.055 --> 02:04:52.989
which is cocaine.

1745
02:04:53.057 --> 02:04:56.083
On one hand you're saying
the United States government...

1746
02:04:56.160 --> 02:04:59.857
is spending millions of dollars
to eliminate the flow of drugs
onto our streets.

1747
02:04:59.930 --> 02:05:04.264
At the same time, we are doing business
with the same government...

1748
02:05:04.335 --> 02:05:07.668
that is flooding
our streets with cocaine.

1749
02:05:07.738 --> 02:05:10.400
Sí. Let me show you
a few of the other characters...

1750
02:05:10.474 --> 02:05:13.272
that are involved
in this tragicomedy.

1751
02:05:13.344 --> 02:05:16.609
My organization just recently
traced a large purchase...

1752
02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:18.773
by this man.

1753
02:05:18.849 --> 02:05:22.012
This charming face here
belongs to General Cucombre.

1754
02:05:22.086 --> 02:05:26.318
He is the minister of the defense
of Bolivia, my country.

1755
02:05:26.390 --> 02:05:29.052
And General Cucombre just
a couple of months ago...

1756
02:05:29.126 --> 02:05:33.654
bought a $12 million villa
on Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.

1757
02:05:33.731 --> 02:05:36.859
Now, if Cucombre is supposed to be
the Bolivian defense minister,

1758
02:05:36.934 --> 02:05:40.233
what is he doing living in Switzerland,
guarding cash registers?

1759
02:05:40.304 --> 02:05:42.864
This man here,

1760
02:05:42.940 --> 02:05:46.432
Alejandro Sosa,
a very interesting character.

1761
02:05:46.510 --> 02:05:51.038
He's a wealthy landowner,
educated in England, very good family.

1762
02:05:51.115 --> 02:05:55.142
But this man is the business brain
and drug overlord...

02:05:55.219 --> 02:05:58.154
of an empire that stretches
across the Andes.

1764
02:05:58.222 --> 02:06:01.214

- That is our problem.

in the disposal business.

He's going to help us
fix our problem.

But he doesn't speak English.

1777
02:06:43.801 --> 02:06:46.929
He doesn't know his way
around the States too well.

1778
02:06:47.004 --> 02:06:49.404
He needs a little help.

- What did you order it for then?
- l lost my appetite.

1803
02:08:32.876 --> 02:08:36.243

a kid with her, Manny.

1829
02:10:10.140 --> 02:10:13.371
Her womb is so polluted,

- What do you do?
- Don't worry.

Are you even gonna be alive

1842
02:10:53.583 --> 02:10:56.814
- You don't even know
how to be a husband!
- Sit down before l--

1843
02:10:56.887 --> 02:11:01.153
Do we ever go anywhere without having

1848
02:11:19.309 --> 02:11:21.174
We're losers.

You don't have the guts
to be what you wanna be?

1867
02:12:34.184 --> 02:12:36.618
You need people like me.

1868

You need people like me

No, no. You tell Sheffield

There's gonna be no trial.
