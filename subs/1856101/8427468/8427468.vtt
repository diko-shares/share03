1
00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:43.509
I hope you don't mind me taking the liberty.

2
00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:50.846
I was careful not to drag in any dirt.

3
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.730
I don't mind the dirt.

4
00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:57.399
I do mind...

5
00:05:58.192 --> 00:06:00.322
...unannounced visits.

6
00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:04.413
You police?

7
00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:11.123
Are you Sapper Morton? Civic number NK68514?

8
00:06:11.288 --> 00:06:14.418
- I'm a farmer.
- I saw that.

9
00:06:15.584 --> 00:06:17.424
What do you farm?

10
00:06:24.635 --> 00:06:26.555
It's a protein farm.

11
00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:28.932
Wallace design.

12
00:06:30.641 --> 00:06:31.891
Is that what I smell?

13
00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:35.191
Grow that just for me.

14
00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:36.847
Garlic.

15
00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:38.362
Garlic.

16
00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:40.944
Go on, try some.

17
00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:43.495
No, thank you.

18
00:06:45.197 --> 00:06:49.277
I prefer to keep an empty stomach
until the hard part of the day is done.

19
00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:53.749
How long you been here?

20
00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:56.044
Since 2020.

21
00:06:56.667 --> 00:06:59.537
But you haven't always
been a farmer, have you?

22
00:07:01.213 --> 00:07:02.553
Your bag.

23
00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:04.838
It's colonial medical use.

24
00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:07.262
Military issue.

25
00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:12.889
Where were you? Calantha?

26
00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:18.653
Must have been brutal.

27
00:07:18.814 --> 00:07:21.114
Plan on taking me in?

28
00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:25.242
Let them take a look inside?

29
00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:27.704
Mr. Morton...

30
00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:31.035
...if taking you in is an option...

31
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.210
...I would much prefer that
to the alternative.

32
00:07:39.168 --> 00:07:42.128
I'm sure you knew
it would be someone in time.

33
00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:46.629
I'm sorry it had to be me.

34
00:07:49.887 --> 00:07:51.757
Good as any.

35
00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:57.523
Now, if you don't mind...

36
00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:02.154
...if you could just look up
and to the left, please.

37
00:08:58.664 --> 00:08:59.794
Please don't get up.

38
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.220
How's it feel killing your own kind?

39
00:09:18.809 --> 00:09:22.479
I don't retire my own kind
because we don't run.

40
00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:25.524
Only older models do.

41
00:09:25.691 --> 00:09:30.491
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit...

42
00:09:35.117 --> 00:09:38.157
...because you've never seen a miracle.

43
00:10:19.036 --> 00:10:21.506
Just photograph everything.

44
00:10:32.716 --> 00:10:34.626
Madam, please.

45
00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:38.351
Incoming L.A.P.D. re-codec hash.

46
00:10:40.641 --> 00:10:42.771
You're hurt. I'm not paying for that.

47
00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:45.766
- I'll glue it.
- And?

48
00:10:52.653 --> 00:10:54.493
One of the tail-end Nexus 8s.

49
00:10:54.655 --> 00:10:57.285
He looks like he could take your head off.

50
00:10:57.449 --> 00:10:58.659
He tried.

51
00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:00.585
He went AWOL after Calantha...

52
00:11:00.744 --> 00:11:04.044
...with a few more in his outfit
I wouldn't mind closing out.

53
00:11:04.206 --> 00:11:06.086
- Just him?
- Just him.

54
00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:09.417
Come on home for your baseline.

55
00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:14.381
One moment, madam.

56
00:12:02.723 --> 00:12:05.393
Thirty meters to maximum depth.

57
00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:21.489
What is that?

58
00:12:27.623 --> 00:12:28.793
I'll send a dig team.

59
00:12:30.459 --> 00:12:32.789
Come on home before the storm.

60
00:13:49.997 --> 00:13:52.657
Officer KD6 - 3.7.

61
00:13:52.833 --> 00:13:56.003
- Let's begin. Ready?
- Yes, sir.

62
00:13:56.962 --> 00:13:58.382
Recite your baseline.

63
00:13:58.547 --> 00:14:02.047
And blood-black nothingness began to spin.

64
00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:06.098
A system of cells interlinked within cells...

65
00:14:06.263 --> 00:14:09.313
...interlinked within cells
interlinked within one stem.

66
00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:11.604
Fuck off, skin-job.

67
00:14:12.853 --> 00:14:18.153
And dreadfully distinct against the dark,
a tall white fountain played.

68
00:14:19.109 --> 00:14:20.149
- Cells.
- Cells.

69
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.280
Have you ever been in an institution? Cells.

70
00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:25.698
- Do they keep you in a cell? Cells.
- Cells.

71
00:14:25.866 --> 00:14:29.746
When you're not performing your duties,
do they keep you in a little box? Cells.

72
00:14:29.912 --> 00:14:31.622
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

73
00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:34.958
What's it like to hold the hand
of someone you love? Interlinked.

74
00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:38.255
Did they teach you how to feel
finger to finger? Interlinked.

75
00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.380
Do you long for having
your heart interlinked? Interlinked.

76
00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:43.918
- Do you dream about being interlinked?
- Interlinked.

77
00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:46.932
What's it like to hold your child
in your arms? Interlinked.

78
00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:50.185
Do you feel that there's a part of you
that's missing? Interlinked.

79
00:14:50.349 --> 00:14:52.769
- Within cells interlinked.
- Within cells interlinked.

80
00:14:52.935 --> 00:14:55.145
Why don't you say that three times?

81
00:14:55.312 --> 00:14:58.192
Within cells interlinked.
Within cells interlinked.

82
00:14:58.357 --> 00:15:01.027
Within cells interlinked.

83
00:15:03.237 --> 00:15:04.857
We're done.

84
00:15:06.198 --> 00:15:08.238
Constant K.

85
00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:10.618
You can pick up your bonus.

86
00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.910
Thank you, sir.

87
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.960
Caution, keep clear.

88
00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:17.794
Caution, keep clear.

89
00:15:19.503 --> 00:15:21.503
Caution, keep clear.

90
00:15:21.672 --> 00:15:25.132
Connect to Off-world any time, any place.

91
00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.720
Packages start at 20 minutes.

92
00:15:27.886 --> 00:15:30.176
Many options available.

93
00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:37.814
Joi goes anywhere you want her to go.

94
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:41.820
Connect to Off-world any time, any place.

95
00:15:41.984 --> 00:15:44.944
Packages start at 20 minutes.

96
00:16:25.319 --> 00:16:28.899
K? I didn't hear you. You're early.

97
00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:31.032
You want me to come back?

98
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.450
- Just go scrub.
- Yes, ma'am.

99
00:16:35.204 --> 00:16:37.204
How was your meeting?

100
00:16:38.624 --> 00:16:40.464
The usual.

101
00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:42.789
How was your day?

102
00:16:44.004 --> 00:16:46.304
I'm getting cabin fever.

103
00:16:46.757 --> 00:16:50.877
99.9 percent detoxified water.

104
00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:58.642
I had an accident at work.
I think I ruined my shirt.

105
00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:02.940
I'm sure I can fix that for you.
Let me take a look at it.

106
00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:10.862
I need a drink.

107
00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:14.158
- Do you want a drink first?
- Pour me one, will you?

108
00:17:16.745 --> 00:17:20.255
I'm trying a new recipe.
I just need a bit more practice.

109
00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:21.465
Don't fuss.

110
00:17:24.586 --> 00:17:29.206
I should have marinated it longer.
I hope it isn't dry.

111
00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:36.224
Did you know this song was released
in 1966 on Reprise Records?

112
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:38.930
It was number one on the charts.

113
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:47.940
It won't be much longer.
Just putting on the finishing touches.

114
00:17:51.613 --> 00:17:55.453
Okay, it's ready.
I hope you're gonna like it.

115
00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:57.197
I told you not to fuss.

116
00:17:59.413 --> 00:18:01.213
And yet...

117
00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:06.292
Voilà! Bon appétit.

118
00:18:09.173 --> 00:18:11.633
I missed you, baby sweet.

119
00:18:13.135 --> 00:18:14.725
Honey, it's beautiful.

120
00:18:15.304 --> 00:18:17.434
Just put your feet up.

121
00:18:17.848 --> 00:18:19.138
Relax.

122
00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:39.239
Was a day?

123
00:18:40.913 --> 00:18:42.833
It was a day.

124
00:18:43.332 --> 00:18:44.542
Would you read to me?

125
00:18:46.627 --> 00:18:47.877
It'll make you feel better.

126
00:18:48.629 --> 00:18:50.799
- You hate that book.
- I don't wanna read either.

127
00:18:53.634 --> 00:18:54.684
Let's dance.

128
00:18:54.843 --> 00:18:57.343
Do you wanna dance,
or do you wanna open your present?

129
00:18:57.513 --> 00:18:59.103
What present?

130
00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:05.483
- This one.
- What's the occasion?

131
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:08.400
Let's just say...

132
00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:10.945
- ...it's our anniversary.
- Is it?

133
00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:16.861
No, but let's just say that it is.

134
00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:18.874
Okay?

135
00:19:22.913 --> 00:19:23.953
Happy anniversary.

136
00:19:25.791 --> 00:19:27.041
An emanator.

137
00:20:10.252 --> 00:20:11.382
Thank you.

138
00:20:11.545 --> 00:20:15.965
Honey, you can go anywhere
you want in the world now.

139
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.010
Where do you wanna go first?

140
00:22:32.936 --> 00:22:35.186
I'm so happy when I'm with you.

141
00:22:37.566 --> 00:22:38.826
You don't have to say that.

142
00:23:10.974 --> 00:23:14.234
The dig's come through. We have a new lead.

143
00:23:14.394 --> 00:23:15.734
Get down here.

144
00:23:29.576 --> 00:23:34.076
Carbon read: 14.6 GPH.

145
00:23:53.684 --> 00:23:58.314
Your box is a military footlocker,
issued to Sapper Morton...

146
00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:03.190
...creatively repurposed
as an ossuary: a box of bones.

147
00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.610
Nothing else in it but hair.

148
00:24:06.613 --> 00:24:10.783
The soil samples indicate
that she's been buried for 30 years.

149
00:24:11.535 --> 00:24:15.585
Bones all dismantled, fully cleaned,
meticulously laid to rest.

150
00:24:15.747 --> 00:24:17.407
"She"?

151
00:24:18.542 --> 00:24:19.672
Cause of death, Coco?

152
00:24:31.054 --> 00:24:35.024
No breaks, no sign of trauma, except...

153
00:24:35.184 --> 00:24:38.274
...a fracture through the ilium.

154
00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:41.520
It's a narrow birth canal.
Baby must have got stuck.

155
00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:43.770
She was pregnant?

156
00:24:44.943 --> 00:24:46.403
So he didn't kill her?

157
00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:47.900
She died in childbirth.

158
00:24:50.282 --> 00:24:51.782
What's that?

159
00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:54.490
Go back.

160
00:24:55.287 --> 00:24:56.787
Closer.

161
00:24:58.123 --> 00:24:59.753
Closer.

162
00:25:02.377 --> 00:25:03.957
What's that?

163
00:25:07.174 --> 00:25:10.934
Notching in the iliac crest.

164
00:25:11.094 --> 00:25:14.474
It's fine-point, like a scalpel.

165
00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:18.350
That looks like an emergency C-section.

166
00:25:18.519 --> 00:25:22.189
The cuts are clean. No sign of a struggle.

167
00:25:22.731 --> 00:25:27.401
He was a combat medic. Maybe he tried
to save her, and he just couldn't.

168
00:25:27.569 --> 00:25:29.949
He didn't seem like the saving type.

169
00:25:30.113 --> 00:25:32.203
He went to the trouble of burying her.

170
00:25:32.366 --> 00:25:33.876
A sentimental skin-job.

171
00:25:36.495 --> 00:25:38.005
Sorry.

172
00:25:38.163 --> 00:25:40.623
So where's the kid?

173
00:25:41.583 --> 00:25:43.463
You scan the whole field?

174
00:25:43.627 --> 00:25:45.997
Just dirt and worms. No other bodies.

175
00:25:46.171 --> 00:25:48.131
Maybe he ate it.

176
00:26:36.763 --> 00:26:38.683
That's not possible.

177
00:26:41.143 --> 00:26:43.393
She was a Replicant.

178
00:26:45.647 --> 00:26:47.267
Pregnant.

179
00:26:56.366 --> 00:26:59.326
The world is built on a wall.

180
00:26:59.703 --> 00:27:01.873
It separates kind.

181
00:27:02.456 --> 00:27:06.466
Tell either side there's no wall,
you bought a war.

182
00:27:06.627 --> 00:27:08.497
Or a slaughter.

183
00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:14.300
So what you saw...

184
00:27:16.094 --> 00:27:17.304
...didn't happen.

185
00:27:19.723 --> 00:27:21.063
Yes, madam.

186
00:27:21.225 --> 00:27:24.065
It is my job to keep order.

187
00:27:24.228 --> 00:27:27.348
That's what we do here. We keep order.

188
00:27:28.899 --> 00:27:30.019
You want it gone?

189
00:27:32.069 --> 00:27:33.689
Erase everything.

190
00:27:33.862 --> 00:27:36.782
- Even the child?
- All trace.

191
00:27:40.869 --> 00:27:43.289
You have anything more to say?

192
00:27:44.706 --> 00:27:47.956
I've never retired something
that was born before.

193
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:50.710
What's the difference?

194
00:27:54.675 --> 00:27:56.975
To be born is to have a soul, I guess.

195
00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.470
Are you telling me no?

196
00:28:01.056 --> 00:28:03.056
I wasn't aware that was an option, madam.

197
00:28:03.642 --> 00:28:05.272
Attaboy.

198
00:28:08.272 --> 00:28:12.072
Hey. You've been getting on fine without one.

199
00:28:12.234 --> 00:28:13.284
What's that, madam?

200
00:28:14.319 --> 00:28:15.939
A soul.

201
00:29:02.701 --> 00:29:07.291
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit...

202
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:12.840
...because you've never seen a miracle.

203
00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:39.320
Just checking in on an old serial number.

204
00:29:43.867 --> 00:29:45.407
Confirmation DNA?

205
00:29:46.745 --> 00:29:48.505
I got hair.

206
00:30:07.307 --> 00:30:09.137
An old one.

207
00:30:09.601 --> 00:30:11.521
Pre-Blackout.

208
00:30:12.646 --> 00:30:15.066
That's gonna be tough.

209
00:30:15.774 --> 00:30:17.404
Not much from then.

210
00:30:17.568 --> 00:30:19.688
And what's there is...

211
00:30:20.028 --> 00:30:21.898
...thick milky.

212
00:30:22.614 --> 00:30:25.494
You can customize them as much as you'd like.

213
00:30:25.868 --> 00:30:28.408
As human as you want them to be.

214
00:30:28.787 --> 00:30:32.157
But your operation is strictly
a drill site, isn't it?

215
00:30:32.332 --> 00:30:37.002
I wouldn't waste your money
on intelligence, attachment or appeal.

216
00:30:37.462 --> 00:30:41.052
Unless you'd like to add
some pleasure models to your order.

217
00:30:54.479 --> 00:30:57.649
Would it be possible
to reschedule this call, please?

218
00:31:00.152 --> 00:31:03.492
Everyone remembers where they were
at the Blackout. You?

219
00:31:03.655 --> 00:31:05.245
That was a little before my time.

220
00:31:06.241 --> 00:31:09.491
I was home with my folks,
then 10 days of darkness.

221
00:31:09.661 --> 00:31:11.201
Every machine stopped cold.

222
00:31:11.371 --> 00:31:13.581
When the lights came back,
we were wiped clean.

223
00:31:13.957 --> 00:31:19.377
Photos, files, every bit of data, gone.
Bank records too.

224
00:31:19.546 --> 00:31:20.706
Didn't mind that.

225
00:31:20.881 --> 00:31:22.921
It's funny it's only paper that lasted.

226
00:31:23.091 --> 00:31:26.551
I mean, we had everything on drives.
Everything, everything, everything.

227
00:31:28.222 --> 00:31:30.722
My mom still cries
over the lost baby pictures.

228
00:31:31.517 --> 00:31:35.187
Well, it's a shame.
You must have been adorable.

229
00:31:41.109 --> 00:31:44.239
Pretty fractured. Not much on it.

230
00:31:44.738 --> 00:31:47.278
One of the last gens, pre-Prohibition.

231
00:31:47.449 --> 00:31:49.319
Standard issue.

232
00:31:49.493 --> 00:31:52.083
- Made by Tyrell.
- And?

233
00:31:53.288 --> 00:31:54.908
Unremarkable.

234
00:31:55.082 --> 00:31:56.332
"Unremarkable"?

235
00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.340
There must be something else
we can find for him.

236
00:32:06.844 --> 00:32:09.604
Another prodigal serial number returns.

237
00:32:10.973 --> 00:32:14.063
A 30-year-old open case finally closed.

238
00:32:14.476 --> 00:32:16.476
Thank you, officer.

239
00:32:17.229 --> 00:32:19.189
I'm here for Mr. Wallace. I'm Luv.

240
00:32:21.775 --> 00:32:23.445
He named you.

241
00:32:24.152 --> 00:32:26.112
Must be special.

242
00:32:26.572 --> 00:32:28.322
I'm here for Mr. Wallace.

243
00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:30.070
Follow me.

244
00:32:35.873 --> 00:32:38.833
The ancient models give
the entire endeavor a bad name.

245
00:32:40.752 --> 00:32:44.922
What a gift, don't you think,
from Mr. Wallace to the world?

246
00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:52.140
The outer colonies would never have
flourished had he not bought Tyrell...

247
00:32:52.306 --> 00:32:54.896
...revivified the technology.

248
00:32:55.309 --> 00:32:57.729
To say the least of what we do.

249
00:33:07.654 --> 00:33:09.824
I see you're also a customer.

250
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:12.530
Are you satisfied with our product?

251
00:33:12.701 --> 00:33:16.831
She's very realistic. Thank you.

252
00:33:17.289 --> 00:33:19.869
Here. All the junk is in here.

253
00:33:20.042 --> 00:33:23.212
Lucky for you, Mr. Wallace is a data hoarder.

254
00:33:35.432 --> 00:33:37.772
No one's been down here in ages.

255
00:33:40.646 --> 00:33:42.486
Sorry about that.

256
00:33:53.742 --> 00:33:58.332
All our memory bearings from the time.
They were all damaged in the Blackout.

257
00:33:58.789 --> 00:34:01.499
But there are sometimes fragments.

258
00:34:17.266 --> 00:34:21.066
You got a little boy. He shows you his
butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.

259
00:34:21.228 --> 00:34:23.268
I'd take him to the doctor.

260
00:34:25.816 --> 00:34:28.286
- There's a wasp crawling on your arm.
- I'd kill it.

261
00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:35.120
You're reading a magazine. You come
across a full-page nude photo of a girl.

262
00:34:35.284 --> 00:34:38.414
Is this testing whether I'm a Replicant
or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

263
00:34:38.579 --> 00:34:40.829
Just answer the questions, please.

264
00:34:44.334 --> 00:34:47.924
It was unclear what she was,
at least to someone.

265
00:34:48.088 --> 00:34:50.008
This was a test.

266
00:34:50.382 --> 00:34:52.682
We were difficult to spot then.

267
00:34:54.219 --> 00:34:57.299
Was there anything unusual
about how you found her?

268
00:34:57.764 --> 00:35:00.314
To warrant an official investigation?

269
00:35:02.686 --> 00:35:05.806
You know how people are
about old serial numbers.

270
00:35:06.356 --> 00:35:10.226
Everyone just sleeps better
when they know where they got to.

271
00:35:12.696 --> 00:35:14.446
She likes him.

272
00:35:15.532 --> 00:35:16.912
Who?

273
00:35:17.284 --> 00:35:19.874
This Officer Deckard.

274
00:35:20.787 --> 00:35:22.997
She's trying to provoke him.

275
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:29.710
It is invigorating being
asked personal questions.

276
00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.760
Makes one feel...

277
00:35:32.799 --> 00:35:34.549
...desired.

278
00:35:35.594 --> 00:35:38.054
Do you enjoy your work, officer?

279
00:35:42.226 --> 00:35:44.236
Please thank Mr. Wallace for your time.

280
00:35:56.907 --> 00:35:59.277
You worked with Officer Deckard...

281
00:35:59.451 --> 00:36:01.201
...back in the day.

282
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:03.160
What can you tell me about him?

283
00:36:03.956 --> 00:36:06.216
He liked to work alone.

284
00:36:07.125 --> 00:36:08.965
So did I.

285
00:36:10.921 --> 00:36:14.421
So we worked together to keep it that way.

286
00:36:15.384 --> 00:36:17.344
That was it.

287
00:36:17.928 --> 00:36:20.258
Anything else you can tell me?

288
00:36:21.849 --> 00:36:24.679
He wasn't long for this world.

289
00:36:26.228 --> 00:36:27.268
How so?

290
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:32.780
Something in his eyes.

291
00:36:35.612 --> 00:36:37.742
Any idea how I could contact him?

292
00:36:38.532 --> 00:36:39.952
None.

293
00:36:41.451 --> 00:36:43.871
He's nyugdíjas.

294
00:36:46.707 --> 00:36:47.827
Retired.

295
00:36:49.751 --> 00:36:51.001
What happened?

296
00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:53.960
Probably got what he wanted.

297
00:36:55.924 --> 00:36:57.304
To be alone.

298
00:37:22.659 --> 00:37:23.779
Welcome back, sir.

299
00:37:26.038 --> 00:37:29.458
You wanted to review the new model,
sir, before shipment?

300
00:37:30.667 --> 00:37:35.377
An angel should never enter
the kingdom of heaven...

301
00:37:35.547 --> 00:37:37.047
...without a gift.

302
00:37:39.676 --> 00:37:43.426
Can you at least pronounce,
"A child is born"?

303
00:37:54.066 --> 00:37:55.946
A new model.

304
00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:06.120
Well, let us see her, then.

305
00:38:54.168 --> 00:38:57.878
The first thought...

306
00:38:59.339 --> 00:39:01.839
...one tends to fear...

307
00:39:02.759 --> 00:39:04.799
...to preserve the clay.

308
00:39:07.347 --> 00:39:09.597
It's fascinating.

309
00:39:10.267 --> 00:39:13.387
Before we even know what we are...

310
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:17.360
...we fear to lose it.

311
00:39:18.734 --> 00:39:20.824
Happy birthday.

312
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:31.750
Now, let's have a look at you.

313
00:40:23.298 --> 00:40:25.798
We make angels...

314
00:40:26.844 --> 00:40:30.264
...in the service of civilization.

315
00:40:31.139 --> 00:40:33.929
Yes, there were bad angels once.

316
00:40:34.101 --> 00:40:36.561
I make good angels now.

317
00:40:36.728 --> 00:40:41.728
That is how I took us to nine new worlds.

318
00:40:43.902 --> 00:40:45.822
Nine.

319
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:50.200
A child can count to nine on fingers.

320
00:40:50.576 --> 00:40:53.336
We should own the stars.

321
00:40:53.495 --> 00:40:54.915
Yes, sir.

322
00:40:57.958 --> 00:41:02.668
Every leap of civilization was built off
the back of a disposable workforce.

323
00:41:02.838 --> 00:41:06.048
We lost our stomach for slaves...

324
00:41:06.216 --> 00:41:08.626
...unless engineered.

325
00:41:11.597 --> 00:41:14.177
But I can only make so many.

326
00:41:19.563 --> 00:41:21.613
That barren pasture...

327
00:41:22.774 --> 00:41:24.614
...empty...

328
00:41:24.776 --> 00:41:26.606
...and salted...

329
00:41:27.946 --> 00:41:29.696
...right here.

330
00:41:31.575 --> 00:41:34.545
The dead space between the stars.

331
00:41:36.788 --> 00:41:39.998
And this, the seat
that we must change for heaven.

332
00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:49.760
I cannot breed them.
So help me, I have tried.

333
00:41:50.427 --> 00:41:53.467
We need more Replicants
than can ever be assembled.

334
00:41:53.639 --> 00:41:57.679
Millions, so we can be trillions more.

335
00:41:59.144 --> 00:42:02.564
We could storm Eden and retake her.

336
00:42:14.493 --> 00:42:16.293
Tyrell's final trick:

337
00:42:17.496 --> 00:42:19.416
Procreation.

338
00:42:19.581 --> 00:42:22.831
Perfected, then lost.

339
00:42:24.044 --> 00:42:25.754
But there is a child.

340
00:42:29.091 --> 00:42:30.841
Bring it to me.

341
00:42:31.301 --> 00:42:32.761
Sir.

342
00:42:40.853 --> 00:42:43.443
The best angel of all.

343
00:42:44.481 --> 00:42:46.481
Aren't you, Luv?

344
00:44:04.061 --> 00:44:05.811
The man with the green jacket.

345
00:44:05.979 --> 00:44:09.859
The one who killed Sapper.
Find out what he knows.

346
00:44:28.836 --> 00:44:30.346
Hi.

347
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:33.630
Hello, hello, A-Boy.

348
00:44:33.799 --> 00:44:35.629
You alone?

349
00:44:42.724 --> 00:44:44.224
It's fine.

350
00:44:50.107 --> 00:44:51.477
Wanna buy a lady a cigarette?

351
00:44:58.866 --> 00:45:00.166
Oh, you don't even smile.

352
00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:05.540
Didn't you hear your friends?

353
00:45:05.706 --> 00:45:07.546
Don't you know what I am?

354
00:45:07.708 --> 00:45:09.458
Yeah.

355
00:45:09.626 --> 00:45:11.746
Guy eating rice.

356
00:45:12.754 --> 00:45:14.424
What's that?

357
00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:16.380
It's a tree.

358
00:45:18.343 --> 00:45:20.763
Never seen a tree before.

359
00:45:21.972 --> 00:45:23.642
It's pretty.

360
00:45:25.475 --> 00:45:27.315
It's dead.

361
00:45:28.687 --> 00:45:33.567
Now, who keeps a dead tree?

362
00:45:40.407 --> 00:45:42.317
You're not gonna kill me, are you?

363
00:45:42.492 --> 00:45:45.122
Depends. What's your model number?

364
00:45:45.746 --> 00:45:47.796
Why don't you look under my eye and find out?

365
00:45:53.045 --> 00:45:55.385
You don't like real girls.

366
00:45:58.258 --> 00:46:01.338
Well, I'm always here.

367
00:49:39.646 --> 00:49:40.686
Hi.

368
00:49:43.358 --> 00:49:45.108
You can't take those.

369
00:49:45.277 --> 00:49:48.397
Of course not. Proper channels
and paperwork. It's all here.

370
00:49:48.572 --> 00:49:50.282
Hold this for me.

371
00:49:51.867 --> 00:49:54.027
Yep. Here you go.

372
00:50:11.136 --> 00:50:13.046
Coco is dead.

373
00:50:15.015 --> 00:50:16.315
Bones are gone.

374
00:50:17.476 --> 00:50:20.646
It's out. Already out.
How long did that take?

375
00:50:22.064 --> 00:50:25.024
So, what do you have for me?
And don't say nothing.

376
00:50:25.943 --> 00:50:27.613
I found that.

377
00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:29.900
A sock?

378
00:50:31.782 --> 00:50:33.822
- Where'd you find it?
- Sapper's.

379
00:50:33.992 --> 00:50:35.082
Anything else?

380
00:50:35.661 --> 00:50:37.491
I burned everything else.

381
00:50:37.663 --> 00:50:40.913
Then what's this? What's that date?
Is that a birthday? A death day?

382
00:50:41.083 --> 00:50:42.753
I don't know yet.

383
00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:48.960
Am I the only one that can see
the fucking sunrise here?

384
00:50:49.132 --> 00:50:51.222
This breaks the world, K.

385
00:51:04.523 --> 00:51:07.193
You know, I've known a lot of your kind.

386
00:51:09.236 --> 00:51:14.036
All useful, but with you, I sometimes forget.

387
00:51:14.616 --> 00:51:17.526
We didn't have any of you where I was a kid.

388
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.710
Do you remember anything?

389
00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:29.590
Before you were under me,
you have any memories from before?

390
00:51:29.756 --> 00:51:31.966
I have memories...

391
00:51:33.677 --> 00:51:36.467
...but they're not real.
They're just implants.

392
00:51:37.347 --> 00:51:39.057
Tell me one.

393
00:51:39.474 --> 00:51:41.484
From when you were a kid.

394
00:51:45.731 --> 00:51:49.821
I feel strange sharing a childhood story,
considering I was never a child.

395
00:51:52.529 --> 00:51:56.449
Well, would it help you share
if I told you it was an order?

396
00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:01.330
I have one about a toy that I had.

397
00:52:01.496 --> 00:52:03.576
A wooden horse.

398
00:52:04.583 --> 00:52:07.133
With an inscription underneath.

399
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:13.760
All I remember is a group of boys
trying to take it away from me.

400
00:52:13.926 --> 00:52:15.096
So I run.

401
00:52:40.702 --> 00:52:44.412
I go looking for a place to hide it,
and the only place is this dark furnace.

402
00:52:46.667 --> 00:52:50.087
It's very dark, and I'm very scared...

403
00:52:50.254 --> 00:52:53.844
...but this horse is all I have,
so I go in anyway.

404
00:53:06.228 --> 00:53:08.308
Later on, those kids find me...

405
00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:11.150
...and they beat me to tell them
where it is, but I don't.

406
00:53:17.865 --> 00:53:19.535
That's it.

407
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:25.080
Little K, fighting for what's his.

408
00:53:26.248 --> 00:53:27.998
It's a good one.

409
00:53:34.173 --> 00:53:35.213
Look at me.

410
00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:41.300
We're all just looking out
for something real.

411
00:53:46.185 --> 00:53:48.695
What happens if I finish that?

412
00:53:52.149 --> 00:53:53.819
Shouldn't I get back to work, madam?

413
00:54:03.911 --> 00:54:06.581
Check back in after DNAbase.

414
00:54:19.593 --> 00:54:22.143
Officer KD6 - 3.7.

415
00:54:25.015 --> 00:54:26.355
Request.

416
00:54:26.517 --> 00:54:30.517
DNA records: children born 6-10-21.

417
00:54:30.687 --> 00:54:32.727
Looking for anomalies.

418
00:54:40.197 --> 00:54:41.697
You have the satcrystal backup?

419
00:54:48.038 --> 00:54:49.078
Okay.

420
00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:51.500
Run it raw.

421
00:55:27.703 --> 00:55:30.333
Mere data makes a man.

422
00:55:31.707 --> 00:55:33.867
A and C and T and G.

423
00:55:34.626 --> 00:55:38.916
The alphabet of you. All from four symbols.

424
00:55:40.048 --> 00:55:41.588
I'm only two:

425
00:55:45.179 --> 00:55:46.849
One and zero.

426
00:55:47.014 --> 00:55:50.524
Half as much but twice
as elegant, sweetheart.

427
00:55:51.685 --> 00:55:53.895
You don't prefer your madam?

428
00:55:56.231 --> 00:55:58.191
You were listening.

429
00:55:58.817 --> 00:56:00.527
Maybe.

430
00:56:02.112 --> 00:56:05.452
You didn't like her enough
to tell her the truth.

431
00:56:05.616 --> 00:56:08.286
Six, 10 and 21.

432
00:56:11.830 --> 00:56:13.910
There's nothing to tell.

433
00:56:14.249 --> 00:56:16.919
How many times have you told me that story?

434
00:56:19.505 --> 00:56:20.675
Your memory?

435
00:56:22.299 --> 00:56:24.129
The date carved beneath.

436
00:56:24.927 --> 00:56:27.467
Six, 10 and 21.

437
00:56:29.681 --> 00:56:31.141
Coincidence?

438
00:56:35.103 --> 00:56:37.943
A dangerous coincidence.

439
00:56:40.817 --> 00:56:43.647
I always knew you were special.

440
00:56:44.738 --> 00:56:46.488
Maybe this is how.

441
00:56:51.828 --> 00:56:53.828
A child.

442
00:56:53.997 --> 00:56:56.457
Of woman born.

443
00:56:57.543 --> 00:56:59.923
Pushed into the world.

444
00:57:00.921 --> 00:57:02.841
Wanted.

445
00:57:03.715 --> 00:57:05.805
Loved.

446
00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:10.470
Well, if it were true...

447
00:57:11.515 --> 00:57:15.735
...I'd be hunted for the rest of my life
by someone just like me.

448
00:57:17.145 --> 00:57:19.775
It's okay to dream a little.

449
00:57:20.107 --> 00:57:23.277
- Isn't it?
- Not if you're us.

450
00:57:29.241 --> 00:57:30.741
Stop.

451
00:57:31.368 --> 00:57:35.788
Put up 4847 and 2181 side-by-side.

452
00:57:40.711 --> 00:57:43.551
They're identical. Translate.

453
00:57:46.884 --> 00:57:48.434
A boy and a girl.

454
00:57:50.387 --> 00:57:53.257
- It's impossible.
- Why?

455
00:57:54.808 --> 00:57:58.138
Two people can't have identical DNA.

456
00:57:59.146 --> 00:58:03.156
One of these isn't real. It's a copy.

457
00:58:07.654 --> 00:58:11.034
They were both processed
at the Morrill Cole Orphanage.

458
00:58:12.951 --> 00:58:15.411
It says the girl died there.

459
00:58:15.579 --> 00:58:17.709
Genetic disorder.

460
00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:20.920
Galatians Syndrome.

461
00:58:21.084 --> 00:58:22.924
And the boy...

462
00:58:24.838 --> 00:58:26.628
...disappears.

463
00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:30.380
Where's the orphanage?

464
00:58:32.804 --> 00:58:34.974
You wanna go for a ride?

465
00:59:50.757 --> 00:59:53.507
Well, here we are.

466
01:00:06.106 --> 01:00:07.306
Buckle up.

467
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:07.830
K?

468
01:02:00.053 --> 01:02:03.433
K? K?

469
01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:06.849
K? K? K?

470
01:02:58.779 --> 01:02:59.899
Stay back.

471
01:03:15.379 --> 01:03:16.839
Fire again.

472
01:03:17.005 --> 01:03:18.965
Fire again.

473
01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:21.340
Fire.

474
01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:35.440
Two hundred feet to the east.

475
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:38.319
Fire.

476
01:03:40.487 --> 01:03:41.737
Go north.

477
01:03:43.949 --> 01:03:45.529
Fire.

478
01:03:46.285 --> 01:03:48.625
Stop. Twenty degrees east.

479
01:03:51.039 --> 01:03:52.539
Stop.

480
01:03:52.708 --> 01:03:54.498
Zoom in.

481
01:03:55.669 --> 01:03:57.459
Closer.

482
01:04:00.465 --> 01:04:02.805
Oh, come on.

483
01:04:03.468 --> 01:04:04.508
Get up.

484
01:04:05.387 --> 01:04:07.007
Do your fucking job.

485
01:04:08.432 --> 01:04:10.562
Find the child.

486
01:04:46.261 --> 01:04:48.011
Watch the car.

487
01:06:26.653 --> 01:06:30.703
Every last piece, or I'll put you outside
where the sky is raining...

488
01:06:30.866 --> 01:06:32.916
...where it's raining fire!

489
01:06:33.076 --> 01:06:34.786
You're in here to work.

490
01:06:34.953 --> 01:06:38.213
And if you're not working, I don't need you.

491
01:06:38.373 --> 01:06:40.793
I don't need any of...

492
01:06:42.961 --> 01:06:44.421
Hi.

493
01:06:51.011 --> 01:06:53.801
The nickel is for the colonial ships.

494
01:06:53.972 --> 01:06:56.772
Closest any of them
or any of us is gonna get...

495
01:06:56.934 --> 01:07:00.194
...to that grand life Off-world.

496
01:07:00.687 --> 01:07:04.307
And I encourage play, I do.
Keeps them occupied...

497
01:07:04.483 --> 01:07:07.113
...and it makes them nimble, right?

498
01:07:07.486 --> 01:07:08.536
But it's work.

499
01:07:09.947 --> 01:07:13.487
It's work that molds them
into a child worth having.

500
01:07:21.959 --> 01:07:23.879
So come on, now.

501
01:07:25.003 --> 01:07:27.343
What sort do you have in mind?

502
01:07:30.551 --> 01:07:34.091
Because I got all kinds.

503
01:07:36.223 --> 01:07:37.813
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I'm not buying.

504
01:07:37.975 --> 01:07:41.065
No, no, no. This is just my game,
and I play it fair.

505
01:07:41.228 --> 01:07:45.108
No. No, I mean, bigger than you...

506
01:07:47.442 --> 01:07:51.202
Bigger than you have tried
to shut me down. Bigger than you.

507
01:07:51.363 --> 01:07:54.243
And they were men, at that.

508
01:07:55.826 --> 01:07:58.416
A little boy came through here
about 30 years back.

509
01:07:59.413 --> 01:08:01.753
I need to see your records.

510
01:08:02.541 --> 01:08:05.001
Legitimate placements,
private sales, everything.

511
01:08:05.544 --> 01:08:07.464
Don't keep records that far back.

512
01:08:07.629 --> 01:08:09.629
- You don't?
- I don't.

513
01:08:11.675 --> 01:08:13.265
Sorry.

514
01:08:13.427 --> 01:08:15.257
Can't help you.

515
01:08:18.098 --> 01:08:19.888
- You can't?
- Nope.

516
01:08:24.646 --> 01:08:25.936
I think you can.

517
01:08:28.358 --> 01:08:30.818
I think someone like you keeps a long memory.

518
01:08:31.695 --> 01:08:36.237
Now you can tell me what you remember or
I can put a hole right here and take a look.

519
01:08:50.047 --> 01:08:53.587
They were laughing and what was it
you said? What'd you say?

520
01:09:11.777 --> 01:09:13.487
Are you coming?

521
01:09:24.081 --> 01:09:26.001
Where is it?

522
01:09:28.877 --> 01:09:30.627
Oh, God.

523
01:09:35.425 --> 01:09:38.145
Where, where, where?

524
01:09:39.638 --> 01:09:42.558
I don't see it. Here.

525
01:09:50.691 --> 01:09:52.321
It's gone.

526
01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:57.570
It's the entire year.

527
01:09:58.907 --> 01:10:00.867
I didn't do that.

528
01:10:01.034 --> 01:10:02.954
That wasn't me.

529
01:10:06.039 --> 01:10:08.959
I didn't. Wasn't me.

530
01:14:43.442 --> 01:14:44.942
I always told you.

531
01:14:45.986 --> 01:14:47.906
You're special.

532
01:14:51.491 --> 01:14:52.571
Born.

533
01:14:53.493 --> 01:14:55.293
Not made.

534
01:14:58.665 --> 01:15:00.925
Hidden with care.

535
01:15:03.795 --> 01:15:06.265
A real boy now.

536
01:15:08.509 --> 01:15:11.049
A real boy needs a real name.

537
01:15:12.304 --> 01:15:13.894
Joe.

538
01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:16.430
"Joe"?

539
01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:19.940
You're too important for K.

540
01:15:20.103 --> 01:15:22.693
Your mother would've named you.

541
01:15:25.442 --> 01:15:26.822
Joe.

542
01:15:29.029 --> 01:15:31.449
- Joe.
- Stop.

543
01:15:37.746 --> 01:15:40.116
How do I know if a memory
is an implant or not?

544
01:15:44.461 --> 01:15:46.841
Who makes the memories?

545
01:16:18.036 --> 01:16:20.286
Dr. Ana Stelline?

546
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:25.540
A visitor.

547
01:16:27.629 --> 01:16:29.419
Is that okay?

548
01:16:29.882 --> 01:16:30.922
Yes.

549
01:16:33.051 --> 01:16:35.221
It's just unusual.

550
01:16:36.471 --> 01:16:40.601
Nice to meet you, Officer KD6 - 3.7.

551
01:16:45.189 --> 01:16:49.269
Sorry. It's a compromised immune system.

552
01:16:49.443 --> 01:16:53.493
A life of freedom,
so long as it's behind glass.

553
01:16:53.906 --> 01:16:56.706
- Is that why you're not Off-world?
- Yes.

554
01:16:57.409 --> 01:17:01.329
My parents had our passes
in pocket, but I took sick.

555
01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:06.670
So it was a new life for me.

556
01:17:06.835 --> 01:17:10.215
And they put me in my cage...

557
01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:13.470
...filled it with everything
they could to keep me happy.

558
01:17:13.634 --> 01:17:18.554
Except company, of course.
And I was used to crowds.

559
01:17:21.558 --> 01:17:22.928
What can I help you with?

560
01:17:24.353 --> 01:17:26.983
Thought you might be able
to help me with a case.

561
01:17:28.273 --> 01:17:34.283
Oh, that's the most interesting thing
I've been offered to help with in ages.

562
01:17:35.155 --> 01:17:38.245
Do you mind if I work while you talk?

563
01:17:39.159 --> 01:17:40.779
Of course.

564
01:17:47.543 --> 01:17:50.383
I promise I hear every word.

565
01:17:56.969 --> 01:17:59.799
They say you're the best
memory-maker there is.

566
01:17:59.972 --> 01:18:02.012
Well, then, they're kind.

567
01:18:03.267 --> 01:18:05.677
I love birthday parties.

568
01:18:09.273 --> 01:18:11.323
You work for Wallace?

569
01:18:11.483 --> 01:18:14.993
Subcontract. I'm one of his suppliers.

570
01:18:15.362 --> 01:18:19.282
He offered to buy me out, but I take
my freedom where I can find it.

571
01:18:20.868 --> 01:18:22.158
Why are you so good?

572
01:18:23.203 --> 01:18:25.253
What makes your memories so authentic?

573
01:18:26.123 --> 01:18:29.293
Well, there's a bit
of every artist in their work.

574
01:18:30.711 --> 01:18:34.171
But I was locked in a sterile chamber at 8...

575
01:18:35.507 --> 01:18:39.427
...so if I wanted to see the world,
I had to imagine it.

576
01:18:40.512 --> 01:18:44.062
Got very good at imagining.

577
01:18:45.017 --> 01:18:47.937
Wallace needs my talent
to maintain a stable product.

578
01:18:49.897 --> 01:18:52.357
I think it's only kind.

579
01:18:53.609 --> 01:18:59.319
Replicants live such hard lives,
made to do what we'd rather not.

580
01:18:59.489 --> 01:19:00.779
I can't help your future...

581
01:19:00.949 --> 01:19:05.699
...but I can give you good memories
to think back on and smile.

582
01:19:05.871 --> 01:19:06.911
It's nice.

583
01:19:07.331 --> 01:19:10.671
It's better than nice. It feels authentic.

584
01:19:10.834 --> 01:19:16.554
And if you have authentic memories,
you have real human responses.

585
01:19:17.007 --> 01:19:19.217
Wouldn't you agree?

586
01:19:27.017 --> 01:19:31.097
Are they all constructed,
or do you ever use ones that are real?

587
01:19:35.442 --> 01:19:38.242
It's illegal to use real memories, officer.

588
01:19:40.489 --> 01:19:42.319
How can you tell the difference?

589
01:19:42.491 --> 01:19:44.871
Can you tell if something...

590
01:19:46.203 --> 01:19:47.333
...really happened?

591
01:19:49.831 --> 01:19:52.421
They all think it's about more detail.

592
01:19:52.876 --> 01:19:55.706
But that's not how memory works.

593
01:19:56.088 --> 01:19:57.838
We recall with our feelings.

594
01:19:58.465 --> 01:20:02.135
Anything real should be a mess.

595
01:20:03.387 --> 01:20:05.427
I can show you.

596
01:20:06.765 --> 01:20:08.225
Sit.

597
01:20:26.410 --> 01:20:31.370
Now, think about the memory
you want me to see.

598
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:34.830
Not even that hard. Just picture it.

599
01:20:35.294 --> 01:20:37.094
Let it play.

600
01:21:26.970 --> 01:21:29.510
Someone lived this, yes.

601
01:21:30.933 --> 01:21:32.853
This happened.

602
01:21:49.159 --> 01:21:51.239
I know it's real.

603
01:22:02.464 --> 01:22:04.384
I know it's real.

604
01:22:07.135 --> 01:22:10.975
Goddamn it!

605
01:22:54.683 --> 01:22:59.273
Officer KD6 - 3.7. Madam is calling you in.

606
01:22:59.438 --> 01:23:00.478
You're under arrest.

607
01:23:00.647 --> 01:23:03.727
Drop your gun and keep your hands
where I can see them.

608
01:23:04.484 --> 01:23:05.534
- Cells.
- Cells.

609
01:23:05.694 --> 01:23:08.074
Have you ever been in an institution? Cells.

610
01:23:08.238 --> 01:23:12.618
When you're not performing your duties,
do they keep you in a little box? Cells.

611
01:23:12.784 --> 01:23:13.994
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

612
01:23:14.161 --> 01:23:16.751
What's it like to hold the hand
of someone you love?

613
01:23:16.914 --> 01:23:19.714
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

614
01:23:19.875 --> 01:23:22.255
- Within cells interlinked.
- Within the cells interlinked.

615
01:23:22.419 --> 01:23:26.339
What's it like to be filled
with dread? Dreadfully.

616
01:23:26.507 --> 01:23:29.337
Do you like being separated
from other people? Distinct.

617
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:32.510
- Dreadfully distinct. Dark.
- Dreadfully distinct. Dark.

618
01:23:32.679 --> 01:23:34.969
- Within cells interlinked.
- Within the cells interlinked.

619
01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:37.640
- Within one stem.
- Within one stem.

620
01:23:37.809 --> 01:23:40.139
- And dreadfully distinct.
- And dreadfully distinct.

621
01:23:40.312 --> 01:23:42.022
- Against the dark.
- Against the dark.

622
01:23:42.189 --> 01:23:46.359
- A tall white fountain played.
- A tall white fountain played.

623
01:23:49.363 --> 01:23:51.993
You're not even close to baseline.

624
01:23:57.538 --> 01:23:59.748
Out! And close the door.

625
01:24:00.332 --> 01:24:02.462
What the fuck is with you?

626
01:24:02.626 --> 01:24:04.676
I put you on a case.

627
01:24:04.837 --> 01:24:07.087
I impressed on you
the importance of that case...

628
01:24:07.256 --> 01:24:11.096
...and then we pick you up fucking
around outside an upgrade center?

629
01:24:12.594 --> 01:24:16.974
Scan said you didn't look like you
on the inside. Miles off your baseline.

630
01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:20.140
- Do you know what that means?
- I found the kid.

631
01:24:24.857 --> 01:24:27.897
He was set up like a standard
Replicant, put on a service job.

632
01:24:30.988 --> 01:24:33.448
Even he didn't know who he was.

633
01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.740
- And?
- And it's done.

634
01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:40.250
- What does that mean, "it's done"?
- What you asked.

635
01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:43.290
It's done.

636
01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:48.550
Fuck.

637
01:24:50.799 --> 01:24:52.629
You just stopped a bomb from going off.

638
01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:56.470
You did good.

639
01:24:58.599 --> 01:25:03.024
I can help you get out of this station alive
but you have 48 hours to get back on track.

640
01:25:03.854 --> 01:25:05.654
Surrender your gun and badge.

641
01:25:05.814 --> 01:25:09.234
And your next baseline test
is out of my hands.

642
01:25:10.861 --> 01:25:12.361
Thank you, madam.

643
01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:46.270
You were right.

644
01:25:52.945 --> 01:25:54.785
You were right about everything.

645
01:26:23.559 --> 01:26:27.689
Thought you weren't interested, worky man.

646
01:26:29.982 --> 01:26:32.322
You liked her. I could tell.

647
01:26:34.862 --> 01:26:35.902
It's okay.

648
01:26:37.322 --> 01:26:39.112
She's real.

649
01:26:40.993 --> 01:26:43.703
I wanna be real for you.

650
01:26:44.413 --> 01:26:46.253
You are real for me.

651
01:26:47.499 --> 01:26:48.959
You have a special lady here.

652
01:27:07.686 --> 01:27:08.726
Okay.

653
01:27:09.563 --> 01:27:11.193
Let's do it.

654
01:27:32.961 --> 01:27:34.461
Look at you.

655
01:27:34.630 --> 01:27:37.130
Quiet now, I have to sync.

656
01:30:32.975 --> 01:30:37.105
Joi is anything you want her to be.

657
01:30:38.272 --> 01:30:42.072
Joi goes anywhere you want her to go.

658
01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:15.390
99.9 percent detoxified water.

659
01:31:44.796 --> 01:31:46.376
It's from a tree.

660
01:31:46.548 --> 01:31:48.378
I'm done with you.

661
01:31:48.926 --> 01:31:50.766
You can go now.

662
01:32:02.105 --> 01:32:04.065
Quiet now.

663
01:32:04.233 --> 01:32:05.943
I've been inside you.

664
01:32:06.568 --> 01:32:09.188
Not so much there as you think.

665
01:32:28.048 --> 01:32:29.338
Coffee?

666
01:32:35.347 --> 01:32:37.807
They'll be coming after me soon.

667
01:32:46.358 --> 01:32:48.438
I'm coming with you.

668
01:32:48.861 --> 01:32:50.071
But not like this.

669
01:32:51.196 --> 01:32:56.196
If they come here looking for you,
they'll have access to all my memories.

670
01:32:56.368 --> 01:32:59.288
You have to delete me from the console.

671
01:32:59.997 --> 01:33:01.827
My present.

672
01:33:03.542 --> 01:33:05.332
Put me there.

673
01:33:07.296 --> 01:33:09.256
I can't do that.

674
01:33:10.424 --> 01:33:12.224
Think about it:

675
01:33:12.926 --> 01:33:15.086
If anything happens to this, that's it.

676
01:33:16.555 --> 01:33:17.685
You're gone.

677
01:33:18.307 --> 01:33:19.847
Yes.

678
01:33:20.934 --> 01:33:23.194
Like a real girl.

679
01:33:28.609 --> 01:33:30.319
Please.

680
01:33:33.197 --> 01:33:34.567
Joe, please.

681
01:33:36.074 --> 01:33:37.574
I want this.

682
01:33:41.747 --> 01:33:44.207
But I can't do it myself.

683
01:34:01.517 --> 01:34:02.847
Break the antenna.

684
01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:44.600
I don't need a real horse.

685
01:34:48.063 --> 01:34:53.193
I don't need a real horse.
I just wanna find out where it's from.

686
01:35:02.953 --> 01:35:04.793
Radiation from a reactor?

687
01:35:12.546 --> 01:35:14.006
It matches a dirty bomb.

688
01:35:22.556 --> 01:35:25.186
There's only one place that dirty.

689
01:35:26.643 --> 01:35:28.603
Nobody lives there.

690
01:36:19.238 --> 01:36:21.028
Go to five.

691
01:36:21.615 --> 01:36:24.415
Four, 30 degrees to the left.

692
01:36:26.286 --> 01:36:27.866
Tilt up.

693
01:36:30.374 --> 01:36:32.674
Elevate to 400 feet.

694
01:36:38.215 --> 01:36:40.305
Radiation analysis.

695
01:36:43.095 --> 01:36:44.805
Move forward.

696
01:36:51.478 --> 01:36:53.058
Tilt up.

697
01:36:53.230 --> 01:36:54.730
Stop.

698
01:36:56.692 --> 01:36:58.362
Move forward.

699
01:36:58.986 --> 01:37:00.826
Go to five.

700
01:37:01.613 --> 01:37:03.493
Seven, move forward.

701
01:37:08.787 --> 01:37:10.447
Six.

702
01:37:11.665 --> 01:37:13.175
Stop.

703
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:17.379
Go to seven.

704
01:37:17.838 --> 01:37:19.378
Eight.

705
01:37:20.257 --> 01:37:21.837
Nine.

706
01:37:25.429 --> 01:37:27.429
Heat analysis.

707
01:37:35.063 --> 01:37:36.523
Life.

708
01:37:37.065 --> 01:37:38.775
What is it?

709
01:37:39.234 --> 01:37:41.574
Guess we're about to find out.

710
01:37:51.622 --> 01:37:53.292
Too dark in here.

711
01:37:56.293 --> 01:37:58.043
I like him.

712
01:37:58.795 --> 01:38:00.595
He's a good boy.

713
01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:03.340
Where is he?

714
01:38:09.431 --> 01:38:12.931
I have no idea. He's off-duty.

715
01:38:13.769 --> 01:38:15.019
Check around.

716
01:38:15.187 --> 01:38:16.937
I checked...

717
01:38:17.856 --> 01:38:20.186
...anywhere a good boy might go.

718
01:38:20.692 --> 01:38:22.532
You're too late.

719
01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:27.070
It's gone.

720
01:38:29.993 --> 01:38:31.873
He destroyed it.

721
01:38:33.997 --> 01:38:36.457
Everything about it.

722
01:38:36.625 --> 01:38:39.845
Well, except for the box of bones
that you already took.

723
01:38:44.091 --> 01:38:48.141
Which, I'll wager, wasn't enough.
Here you are.

724
01:38:55.352 --> 01:38:57.812
You tiny thing.

725
01:38:59.064 --> 01:39:02.944
In the face of the fabulous new,
your only thought is to kill it?

726
01:39:03.944 --> 01:39:06.824
For fear of great change?

727
01:39:07.489 --> 01:39:10.659
You can't hold the tide with a broom.

728
01:39:11.034 --> 01:39:12.914
Except that I did.

729
01:39:14.079 --> 01:39:15.579
Where is he?!

730
01:39:19.585 --> 01:39:21.425
You're so sure.

731
01:39:22.588 --> 01:39:24.838
Because he told you.

732
01:39:25.007 --> 01:39:27.337
Because we never lie.

733
01:39:28.844 --> 01:39:32.144
I'm gonna tell Mr. Wallace
you tried to shoot me first.

734
01:39:32.806 --> 01:39:35.266
So I had to kill you.

735
01:39:39.313 --> 01:39:41.023
Then do what you gotta do.

736
01:39:42.524 --> 01:39:43.824
Madam.

737
01:40:15.933 --> 01:40:19.063
Location: Officer KD6 - 3.7.

738
01:45:07.432 --> 01:45:12.692
Mightn't happen to have
a piece of cheese about you, now?

739
01:45:13.272 --> 01:45:15.192
Would you, boy?

740
01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:31.120
Treasure Island?

741
01:45:38.213 --> 01:45:40.093
He reads.

742
01:45:40.966 --> 01:45:42.686
That's good.

743
01:45:43.468 --> 01:45:45.178
Me too.

744
01:45:45.971 --> 01:45:49.641
Not much else to do around here
at night anymore.

745
01:45:51.977 --> 01:45:56.977
Many is the night I dream of cheese...

746
01:45:59.985 --> 01:46:03.785
...toasted, mostly.

747
01:46:06.617 --> 01:46:08.737
What are you doing here?

748
01:46:11.496 --> 01:46:12.706
I heard the piano.

749
01:46:15.125 --> 01:46:16.795
Don't lie.

750
01:46:17.836 --> 01:46:19.126
It's rude.

751
01:46:21.423 --> 01:46:23.263
You're a cop.

752
01:46:24.301 --> 01:46:26.721
- I'm not here to take you in.
- Oh, yeah?

753
01:46:29.973 --> 01:46:31.063
Then, what?

754
01:46:33.602 --> 01:46:35.602
I just have some questions.

755
01:46:36.355 --> 01:46:37.735
What questions?

756
01:46:55.874 --> 01:46:57.124
Stay.

757
01:49:30.696 --> 01:49:33.326
Look, I don't wanna hurt you.

758
01:49:33.949 --> 01:49:35.569
But you're not making it easy.

759
01:50:25.250 --> 01:50:26.960
I like this song.

760
01:50:37.429 --> 01:50:40.929
We could keep at this,
or we could get a drink.

761
01:50:53.153 --> 01:50:54.993
I'll take the drink.

762
01:51:03.121 --> 01:51:05.081
This is really something.

763
01:51:05.249 --> 01:51:07.369
The whole town was something.

764
01:51:07.543 --> 01:51:09.383
One time.

765
01:51:11.004 --> 01:51:13.174
Forget your troubles...

766
01:51:14.132 --> 01:51:16.222
...see a show...

767
01:51:17.636 --> 01:51:19.766
...gamble a little.

768
01:51:22.057 --> 01:51:24.847
Win some money, lose some money.

769
01:51:25.477 --> 01:51:29.017
They made money seem like candy.

770
01:51:29.189 --> 01:51:31.109
You like whiskey?

771
01:51:31.275 --> 01:51:33.485
I've got millions...

772
01:51:33.652 --> 01:51:36.072
...of bottles of whiskey.

773
01:51:49.751 --> 01:51:50.791
Here.

774
01:51:52.171 --> 01:51:53.801
Bleeding.

775
01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:07.350
Is it real?

776
01:52:08.478 --> 01:52:09.978
I don't know.

777
01:52:10.147 --> 01:52:11.937
Ask him.

778
01:52:28.248 --> 01:52:29.328
You got a name?

779
01:52:31.710 --> 01:52:33.210
Officer KD6 - 3.7...

780
01:52:33.378 --> 01:52:36.168
That's not a name. That's a serial number.

781
01:52:39.051 --> 01:52:40.631
All right.

782
01:52:43.055 --> 01:52:44.515
Joe.

783
01:52:44.681 --> 01:52:46.891
What do you want, Joe?

784
01:52:47.935 --> 01:52:51.065
- I wanna ask you some questions.
- Like what?

785
01:52:57.402 --> 01:53:01.612
Like what was her name,
the mother of your child?

786
01:53:08.288 --> 01:53:09.788
What was she like?

787
01:53:20.968 --> 01:53:24.758
- You two live here together?
- Too many questions.

788
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:27.010
I had your job. I was good at it.

789
01:53:27.724 --> 01:53:30.144
- It was simpler then.
- Why you making it complicated?

790
01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:32.640
- Why don't you answer the question?
- What question?

791
01:53:32.813 --> 01:53:35.813
I didn't figure you as one for bullshit.

792
01:53:36.358 --> 01:53:37.778
What's her name?

793
01:53:51.373 --> 01:53:52.963
Rachael.

794
01:53:57.671 --> 01:53:59.841
Her name was Rachael.

795
01:54:03.719 --> 01:54:05.339
What happened to the kid?

796
01:54:08.599 --> 01:54:11.519
Who put it in the orphanage? Was it you?

797
01:54:14.062 --> 01:54:15.602
I was long gone by then.

798
01:54:19.735 --> 01:54:22.195
You didn't even meet your own kid?

799
01:54:24.531 --> 01:54:26.161
Why?

800
01:54:26.992 --> 01:54:28.622
Because that was the plan.

801
01:54:31.413 --> 01:54:36.043
I showed them how to scramble
the records, cover their tracks.

802
01:54:36.585 --> 01:54:39.555
Everyone had a part. Mine was to leave.

803
01:54:40.839 --> 01:54:43.219
Then the Blackout came,
paved over everything.

804
01:54:43.383 --> 01:54:45.803
Couldn't have found the child if I tried.

805
01:54:45.969 --> 01:54:48.509
- Did you want to?
- Not really.

806
01:54:49.431 --> 01:54:53.231
- Why not?
- Because we were being hunted.

807
01:54:53.393 --> 01:54:55.733
I didn't want our child found...

808
01:54:56.230 --> 01:54:59.770
...taken apart, dissected.

809
01:55:03.278 --> 01:55:06.488
Sometimes, to love someone...

810
01:55:08.242 --> 01:55:10.532
...you gotta be a stranger.

811
01:55:31.348 --> 01:55:33.178
To strangers.

812
01:57:44.815 --> 01:57:46.445
What'd you do?

813
01:57:46.608 --> 01:57:48.228
Who'd you bring?

814
01:57:50.070 --> 01:57:52.820
- No one.
- Oh, yeah?

815
01:57:58.120 --> 01:57:59.450
Target locked.

816
01:58:01.999 --> 01:58:03.119
They know you're here.

817
01:58:05.169 --> 01:58:07.089
I came alone.

818
02:00:13.755 --> 02:00:14.845
Bad dog.

819
02:00:32.733 --> 02:00:34.153
Stop.

820
02:00:50.167 --> 02:00:52.327
I do hope you're satisfied with our product.

821
02:00:53.420 --> 02:00:55.130
I love...

822
02:04:08.699 --> 02:04:13.329
Hey, there's someone who wants to meet you.

823
02:04:14.621 --> 02:04:16.001
You can trust us.

824
02:04:24.423 --> 02:04:27.343
You must want me to look up and to the left.

825
02:04:33.098 --> 02:04:34.308
This is Freysa.

826
02:04:35.434 --> 02:04:37.564
She fought with Sapper on Calantha.

827
02:04:37.728 --> 02:04:39.648
I recognize you.

828
02:04:41.607 --> 02:04:43.567
Did you help him hide the child?

829
02:04:45.777 --> 02:04:47.737
I was there.

830
02:04:51.158 --> 02:04:53.698
I saw a miracle delivered.

831
02:04:54.578 --> 02:04:58.118
A perfect little face crying up at me.

832
02:04:58.498 --> 02:05:00.868
Mad as thunder.

833
02:05:13.722 --> 02:05:15.642
Were you with her?

834
02:05:17.267 --> 02:05:18.727
Rachael?

835
02:05:18.894 --> 02:05:21.524
I held her as she died.

836
02:05:22.481 --> 02:05:27.151
We hid the child and made
a vow to keep our secret.

837
02:05:27.319 --> 02:05:30.109
That's why Sapper let you kill him.

838
02:05:31.073 --> 02:05:37.793
I knew that baby meant
we are more than just slaves.

839
02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:40.960
If a baby can come from one of us...

840
02:05:41.124 --> 02:05:44.294
...we are our own masters.

841
02:05:44.461 --> 02:05:47.131
More human than humans.

842
02:05:49.007 --> 02:05:50.757
A revolution is coming.

843
02:05:51.301 --> 02:05:53.841
And we're building an army.

844
02:05:54.721 --> 02:05:56.721
I want to free our people.

845
02:06:05.232 --> 02:06:06.902
If you want to be free...

846
02:06:07.609 --> 02:06:09.359
...join us.

847
02:06:14.283 --> 02:06:17.083
Deckard, Sapper, you, me...

848
02:06:17.244 --> 02:06:21.214
...our lives mean nothing
next to a storm that's coming.

849
02:06:21.999 --> 02:06:26.669
Dying for the right cause
is the most human thing we can do.

850
02:06:29.298 --> 02:06:31.798
You led Wallace to Deckard.

851
02:06:32.176 --> 02:06:36.516
You cannot allow Deckard
to lead Wallace to me.

852
02:06:36.680 --> 02:06:38.560
You must kill Deckard.

853
02:06:48.025 --> 02:06:51.495
Deckard only wanted his baby to be safe.

854
02:06:51.653 --> 02:06:52.703
And she is.

855
02:06:55.365 --> 02:06:58.785
When the time comes,
I will show her to the world...

856
02:06:58.952 --> 02:07:01.082
...and she will lead our army.

857
02:07:01.246 --> 02:07:02.656
"She"?

858
02:07:02.831 --> 02:07:04.711
Of course.

859
02:07:04.875 --> 02:07:07.215
Rachael had a daughter.

860
02:07:08.212 --> 02:07:11.592
With my own eyes, I saw her come.

861
02:07:12.090 --> 02:07:14.930
I dressed her in blue
when it was time for her to go.

862
02:07:15.093 --> 02:07:17.183
It was a boy that you hid.

863
02:07:19.389 --> 02:07:22.889
That is just a piece of the puzzle.

864
02:07:39.326 --> 02:07:42.336
You imagined it was you?

865
02:07:45.082 --> 02:07:46.672
You did.

866
02:07:47.167 --> 02:07:48.747
You did.

867
02:07:51.380 --> 02:07:54.090
We all wish it was us.

868
02:07:55.175 --> 02:07:57.635
That's why we believe.

869
02:08:13.610 --> 02:08:15.490
Someone lived this, yes.

870
02:08:17.906 --> 02:08:22.526
I showed them how to scramble
the records, cover their tracks.

871
02:08:22.703 --> 02:08:25.083
With my own eyes, I saw her come.

872
02:08:26.832 --> 02:08:30.882
I dressed her in blue
when it was time for her to go.

873
02:08:31.253 --> 02:08:33.593
There's a bit of every artist in their work.

874
02:09:12.002 --> 02:09:14.752
Always jumping, that one.

875
02:09:15.339 --> 02:09:18.509
Never a thought of what to do
if it made land.

876
02:09:19.510 --> 02:09:24.640
All the courage in the world
cannot alter fact.

877
02:09:28.894 --> 02:09:33.614
I have wanted to meet you for so very long.

878
02:09:52.543 --> 02:09:55.543
You are a wonder to me, Mr. Deckard.

879
02:10:01.051 --> 02:10:02.631
I had the lock.

880
02:10:04.429 --> 02:10:06.809
I found the key.

881
02:10:07.975 --> 02:10:13.195
Yet the pins do not align.
The door remains locked.

882
02:10:15.232 --> 02:10:19.282
I need the specimen to reach it, Mr. Deckard.

883
02:10:22.406 --> 02:10:24.116
The child.

884
02:10:25.284 --> 02:10:26.784
I need the child.

885
02:10:28.370 --> 02:10:30.870
To teach them all to fly.

886
02:10:39.298 --> 02:10:43.588
And God remembered Rachel...

887
02:10:45.179 --> 02:10:48.809
...heeded her and opened her womb.

888
02:10:50.392 --> 02:10:52.432
Do you like our owl?

889
02:10:54.897 --> 02:10:56.607
It's artificial?

890
02:10:57.608 --> 02:10:59.728
Of course it is.

891
02:11:00.986 --> 02:11:02.906
Must be expensive.

892
02:11:04.489 --> 02:11:07.159
Very. I'm Rachael.

893
02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:09.790
Deckard.

894
02:11:21.632 --> 02:11:23.722
Is it the same...

895
02:11:24.718 --> 02:11:27.678
...now, as then...

896
02:11:29.848 --> 02:11:32.098
...the moment you met her?

897
02:11:41.777 --> 02:11:44.777
All these years
you looked back on that day...

898
02:11:44.947 --> 02:11:48.817
...drunk on the memory of its perfection.

899
02:11:51.495 --> 02:11:53.665
How shiny her lips.

900
02:11:53.830 --> 02:11:56.870
How instant your connection.

901
02:11:59.670 --> 02:12:04.670
Did it never occur to you that's why
you were summoned in the first place?

902
02:12:06.051 --> 02:12:12.101
Designed to do nothing short
of fall for her right then and there.

903
02:12:13.809 --> 02:12:19.689
All to make that single perfect specimen.

904
02:12:22.442 --> 02:12:25.902
That is, if you were designed.

905
02:12:26.780 --> 02:12:28.360
Love...

906
02:12:28.532 --> 02:12:31.492
...or mathematical precision.

907
02:12:36.999 --> 02:12:38.539
Yes.

908
02:12:39.293 --> 02:12:40.963
No.

909
02:12:45.257 --> 02:12:47.587
I know what's real.

910
02:13:11.283 --> 02:13:14.623
It was very clever to keep
yourself empty of information...

911
02:13:14.786 --> 02:13:18.956
...and all it cost you was everything.

912
02:13:22.586 --> 02:13:24.296
But you can still help me.

913
02:13:26.173 --> 02:13:29.883
You had help in the hiding.

914
02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:34.010
Where did they go?

915
02:13:35.307 --> 02:13:37.217
I know you know something.

916
02:13:38.477 --> 02:13:40.267
Help me...

917
02:13:40.896 --> 02:13:44.946
...and very, very good things
can come to you.

918
02:13:50.113 --> 02:13:52.453
You don't have children...

919
02:13:55.577 --> 02:13:56.697
...do you?

920
02:13:57.496 --> 02:14:00.506
Oh, I have millions.

921
02:14:02.209 --> 02:14:05.539
You think I have nothing to offer but pain.

922
02:14:05.712 --> 02:14:08.052
Only I know...

923
02:14:08.799 --> 02:14:10.629
...you love pain.

924
02:14:11.844 --> 02:14:16.764
Pain reminds you the joy you felt was real.

925
02:14:18.350 --> 02:14:20.390
More joy, then.

926
02:14:26.441 --> 02:14:28.571
Do not be afraid.

927
02:14:43.333 --> 02:14:44.883
An angel...

928
02:14:46.044 --> 02:14:47.174
...made again.

929
02:14:51.675 --> 02:14:53.345
For you.

930
02:15:27.377 --> 02:15:29.377
Did you miss me?

931
02:15:47.147 --> 02:15:49.107
Don't you love me?

932
02:16:07.835 --> 02:16:09.215
Her eyes were green.

933
02:16:27.104 --> 02:16:29.364
Off-world...

934
02:16:29.523 --> 02:16:33.283
...I have everything I need to make you talk.

935
02:16:34.653 --> 02:16:37.823
You do not know what pain is yet.

936
02:16:38.907 --> 02:16:40.817
You will learn.

937
02:16:52.629 --> 02:16:54.669
Hello, handsome.

938
02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:13.900
What a day.

939
02:17:17.738 --> 02:17:19.358
You look lonely.

940
02:17:20.657 --> 02:17:23.117
I can fix that.

941
02:17:26.038 --> 02:17:28.658
You look like a good joe.

942
02:18:04.159 --> 02:18:09.959
Dying for the right cause
is the most human thing we can do.

943
02:18:12.292 --> 02:18:15.252
Because you've never seen a miracle.

944
02:18:53.417 --> 02:18:56.587
You're entering Los Angeles Airport
restricted airspace.

945
02:18:56.753 --> 02:18:59.053
Confirm your identity.

946
02:18:59.214 --> 02:19:02.094
Transport S-14-4-XD. Confirmed.

947
02:19:02.259 --> 02:19:03.969
Space, this is 0-6.

948
02:19:04.136 --> 02:19:06.856
Outbound departure, route 0-3-0.

949
02:19:07.014 --> 02:19:08.934
Where are we going?

950
02:19:09.683 --> 02:19:11.313
Home.

951
02:20:06.240 --> 02:20:07.990
Drive two down.

952
02:20:08.158 --> 02:20:10.238
Backup engaged.

953
02:20:11.203 --> 02:20:12.243
Warning.

954
02:20:12.412 --> 02:20:15.212
- Can we make it?
- We're too low!

955
02:20:15.374 --> 02:20:16.504
Take us back!

956
02:21:05.674 --> 02:21:06.724
Get us up.

957
02:21:31.867 --> 02:21:33.117
Open the door.

958
02:23:26.315 --> 02:23:28.405
I'm the best one.

959
02:24:08.899 --> 02:24:11.029
Off-world is waiting.

960
02:26:24.117 --> 02:26:27.157
Joe. Joe!

961
02:26:36.797 --> 02:26:38.507
Joe!

962
02:27:17.462 --> 02:27:19.672
You should have let me die out there.

963
02:27:20.674 --> 02:27:22.304
You did.

964
02:27:25.971 --> 02:27:28.101
You drowned out there.

965
02:27:33.478 --> 02:27:35.268
You're free to meet your daughter now.

966
02:29:01.108 --> 02:29:03.778
All the best memories are hers.

967
02:29:12.703 --> 02:29:14.123
Why?

968
02:29:16.665 --> 02:29:18.585
Who am I to you?

969
02:29:27.843 --> 02:29:29.843
Go meet your daughter.

970
02:29:35.767 --> 02:29:37.227
You okay?

971
02:32:13.509 --> 02:32:15.339
Just a moment.

972
02:32:17.596 --> 02:32:18.976
Beautiful, isn't it?
