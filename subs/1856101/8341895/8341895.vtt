00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.970
I hope you don't mind me
taking the liberty.

2
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.370
I was careful
not to drag in any dirt.

3
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.680
I don't mind the dirt.

4
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.910
I do mind

5
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.720
unannounced visits.

6
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.460
You police?

7
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.066
Are you Sapper Morton?
Civic number NK68514?

8
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.436
I'm a farmer.

9
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.460
I saw that.

10
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.900
What do you farm?

11
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:25.610
It's a protein farm.

12
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.380
Wallace design.

13
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:31.850
Is that what I smell?

14
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.556
Grow that just for me.

15
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.920
Garlic.

16
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.420
Go on, try some.

17
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.060
No, thank you.

18
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.606
I prefer to keep
an empty stomach

19
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.430
until the hard part
of the day is done.

20
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.776
How long you been here?

21
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.546
Since 2020.

22
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.580
But you haven't always
been a farmer, have you?

23
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.886
Your bag.

24
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.096
It's colonial medical use.

25
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.720
Military issue.

26
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.460
Where were you? Calantha?

27
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.500
Must have been brutal.

28
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.900
Plan on taking me in?

29
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.746
Let them take a look inside?

30
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.146
Mr. Morton,

31
00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.910
if taking you in is an option,

32
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.956
I would much prefer that
to the alternative.

33
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.720
I'm sure you knew
it would be someone in time.

34
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.620
I'm sorry it had to be me.

35
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.760
Good as any.

36
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:58.946
Now, if you don't mind,

37
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.970
if you could just look up
and to the left, please.

38
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.930
Please don't get up.

39
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.080
How's it feel
killing your own kind?

40
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.950
I don't retire my own kind
because we don't run.

41
00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.726
Only older models do.

42
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:30.290
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit

43
00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.000
because you've never
seen a miracle.

44
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.080
Just photograph everything.

45
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.736
Madam, please.

46
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.390
<i>Incoming LAPD re-codec hash.</i>

47
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.800
<i>You're hurt.
I'm not payin' for that.</i>

48
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:45.740
- I'll glue it.
- <i>And?</i>

49
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.416
<i>One of the tail-end Nexus 8s.</i>

50
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.810
<i>He looks like he could
take your head off.</i>

51
00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.726
He tried.

52
00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.726
<i>He went AWOL after Calantha</i>

53
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:04.166
<i>with a few more in his outfit
I wouldn't mind closin' out.</i>

54
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:07.036
- <i>Just him?</i>
- Just him.

55
00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.300
<i>Come on home for your baseline.</i>

56
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.300
One moment, madam.

57
00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.850
30 meters to maximum depth.

58
00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:21.400
<i>What is that?</i>

59
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.840
<i>I'll send a dig team.</i>

60
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.180
<i>Come on home before the storm.</i>

61
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:52.566
<i>Officer KD6-3.7.</i>

62
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:55.260
<i>- Let's begin. Ready?
- Yes, sir.</i>

63
00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:58.336
<i>Recite your baseline.</i>

64
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.430
<i>And blood-black
nothingness began to spin</i>

65
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.116
<i>A system of cells
interlinked within cells</i>

66
00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:07.376
<i>interlinked within cells</i>

67
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.246
<i>interlinked within one stem.</i>

68
00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.070
Fuck off, skin-job.

69
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.286
<i>And dreadfully distinct
Against the dark,</i>

70
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.480

<i>When you're not
performing your duties,</i>

77

82

84
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.176

<i>Do you dream

Interlinked.

<i>We're done.</i>

<i>You can pick up your bonus.</i>

Thank you, sir.

<i>Caution, keep clear.</i>

102
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.880

<i>Connect to

109
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:29.026
"K"? I didn't hear you.
You're early.

110
00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:31.126
You want me to come back?

111
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:32.256
Just go scrub.

112
00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.450
Yes, ma'am.

113
00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.650
How was your meeting?

114
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:40.996
The usual.

115
00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.766
How was your day?

116
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:46.636
I'm getting cabin fever.

117
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.130
<i>99.9% detoxified water.</i>

118
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.716
I had an accident at work.
I think I ruined my shirt.

119
00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.016
I'm sure I can fix that for you.

120
00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.450
Let me take a look at it.

121
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.320
I need a drink.

122
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:12.666
Do you want a drink first?

123
00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:14.190
Mmm-hmm.
Pour me one, will ya?

124
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.636
I'm trying a new recipe.

125
00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.376
I just need a bit more practice.

126
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.600
Don't fuss.

127
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:27.216
I should have
marinated it longer.

128
00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.700
I hope it isn't dry.

129
00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:32.816
Did you know
this song was released

130
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:36.326
in 1966 on Reprise Records?

131
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:38.250
It was number one on the charts.

132
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.396
It won't be much longer.

133
00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.490
Just putting on
the finishing touches.

134
00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:55.476
Okay, it's ready.
I hope you're gonna like it.

135
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.530
I told you not to fuss.

136
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:00.640
And yet...

137
00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.310
Voilà! Bon appétit.

138
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.180
I missed you, baby sweet.

139
00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:15.256
Honey, it's beautiful.

140
00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.090
Just put your feet up.

141
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.190
Relax.

142
00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:39.280
Was a day, hmm?

143
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.310
It was a day.

144
00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:44.480
Would you read to me?

145
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.526
It'll make you feel better.

146
00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:50.720
- You hate that book.
- I don't wanna read either.

147
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:55.266
Let's dance.

148
00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.436
Do you wanna dance, or do you
wanna open your present?

149
00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:58.760
What present?

150
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.346
This one.

151
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:05.470
What's the occasion?

152
00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.546
Let's just say

153
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:10.840
- it's our anniversary.
- Is it?

154
00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:17.156
No, but let's just
say that it is.

155
00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.780
Okay?

156
00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:23.850
Happy anniversary.

157
00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.120
An emanator.

158
00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.806
Thank you.

159
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:15.500
Honey, you can go anywhere
you want in the world now.

160
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.540
Where do you wanna go first?

161
00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.080
I'm so happy when I'm with you.

162
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:38.780
You don't have to say that.

163
00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.156
<i>The dig's come through.
We have a new lead.</i>

164
00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:15.720
<i>Get down here.</i>

165
00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:33.100
<i>Carbon read: 14.6 GPH.</i>

166
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:55.766
Your box
is a military footlocker

167
00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:58.466
issued to Sapper Morton,

168
00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:00.936
creatively repurposed
as an ossuary:

169
00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.176
a box of bones.

170
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.030
Nothin' else in it but hair.

171
00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.476
The soil samples indicate that

172
00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.516
she's been buried for 30 years.

173
00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.916
Bones all dismantled,
fully cleaned,

174
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.756
meticulously laid to rest.

175
00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:16.980
"She"?

176
00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:19.680
Cause of death, Coco?

177
00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:35.006
No breaks,
no sign of trauma, except

178
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:38.706
a fracture through the ilium.

179
00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:41.676
It's a narrow birth canal.
Baby must have got stuck.

180
00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.846
- She was pregnant?
- Hmm.

181
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.186
So he didn't kill her?

182
00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:48.080
Mmm. She died in childbirth.

183
00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:50.910
What's that?

184
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.020
Go back.

185
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:55.750
Closer.

186
00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.160
Closer.

187
00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:03.560
What's that?

188
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:07.006
Huh.

189
00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:10.976
Notching in the iliac crest.

190
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.246
It's fine-point,
like a scalpel.

191
00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.516
That looks like
an emergency C-section.

192
00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:21.810
The cuts are clean.
No sign of a struggle.

193
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:25.586
He was a combat medic.

194
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.556
Maybe he tried to save her
and he just couldn't.

195
00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.956
He didn't seem like
the saving type.

196
00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.266
He went to the trouble
of burying her.

197
00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:33.860
A sentimental skin-job.

198
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.236
Sorry.

199
00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:40.130
So where's the kid?

200
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.076
You scan the whole field?

201
00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:44.776
Just dirt and worms.

202
00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.046
No other bodies.

203
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:47.640
Maybe he ate it.

204
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:38.720
That's not possible.

205
00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.830
She was a Replicant.

206
00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.260
Pregnant.

207
00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.656
The world is built on a wall.

208
00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.180
It separates kind.

209
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:04.356
Tell either side
there's no wall,

210
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.626
you bought a war.

211
00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:08.020
Or a slaughter.

212
00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:13.890
So, what you saw

213
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.230
didn't happen.

214
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:21.076
Yes, madam.

215
00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:24.106
It is my job to keep order.

216
00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:27.040
That's what we do here.
We keep order.

217
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:30.010
You want it gone?

218
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:33.816
Erase everything.

219
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.056
Even the child?

220
00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.280
All trace.

221
00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:42.920
You have anything more to say?

222
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:47.660
I've never retired something
that was born before.

223
00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.190
What's the difference?

224
00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.970
To be born is to have a soul,
I guess.

225
00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:59.370
Are you telling me no?

226
00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.040
I wasn't aware
that was an option, madam.

227
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:04.910
Attaboy.

228
00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:09.886
Hey.

229
00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:12.226
You've been getting on fine
without one.

230
00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:13.250
What's that, madam?

231
00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.690
A soul.

232
00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:07.240
<i>And you new models
are happy scraping the shit</i>

233
00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:12.140
<i>because you've never seen
a miracle.</i>

234
00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:38.940
Just checking in
on an old serial number.

235
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:45.340
Confirmation DNA?

236
00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.080
I got hair.

237
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:08.260
Oh! An old one.

238
00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.530
Pre-Blackout. Huh.

239
00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.340
That's gonna be tough.

240
00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.346
Not much from then.

241
00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:19.986
And what's there is

242
00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:22.456
thick milky.

243
00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.856
You can customize them
as much as you'd like.

244
00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.596
As human as you want them to be.

245
00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:32.226
But your operation is strictly
a drill site, isn't it?

246
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:34.296
I wouldn't waste your money
on intelligence,

247
00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.336
attachment or appeal.

248
00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:40.860
Unless you'd like to add some
pleasure models to your order.

249
00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:57.250
Would it be possible to
reschedule this call, please?

250
00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.356
Everyone remembers

251
00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.496
where they were
at the Blackout. You?

252
00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.326
That was a little
before my time.

253
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.866
Mmm. I was home with my folks,

254
00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:11.266
then ten days of darkness.
Every machine stopped cold.

255
00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:13.936
When the lights came back,
we were wiped clean.

256
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.506
Photos, files, every bit of
data... Ffft! Gone.

257
00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:19.406
Bank records, too.

258
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:20.916
Didn't mind that.

259
00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.016
It's funny it's only paper
that lasted.

260
00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.316
I mean, we had
everything on drives.

261
00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:28.156
Everything, everything,
everything! Huh.

262
00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.356
My mom still cries
over the lost baby pictures.

263
00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.456
Well, it's a shame. You

264
00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.320
- must have been adorable.
- Hmm... Ah.

265
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.066
Uh...

266
00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:44.606
Pretty fractured.
Not much on it.

267
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:47.506
One of the last gens,
pre-Prohibition.

268
00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:51.076
Standard issue.
Made by Tyrell.

269
00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.100
And?

270
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.016
Unremarkable.

271
00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.586
"Unremarkable"?

272
00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:59.080
There must be something
else we can find for him.

273
00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.490
Another prodigal
serial number returns.

274
00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:14.396
A 30-year-old open case
finally closed.

275
00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.060
Thank you, officer.

276
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:19.200
I'm here for Mr. Wallace.
I'm Luv.

277
00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.100
He named you.

278
00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:26.416
Must be special.

279
00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.416
I'm here for Mr. Wallace.

280
00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:29.670
Follow me.

281
00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:38.920
The ancient models give the
entire endeavor a bad name.

282
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.990
What a gift, don't you think,
from Mr. Wallace to the world?

283
00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:50.536
The outer colonies
would never have flourished

284
00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.266
had he not bought Tyrell,

285
00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:55.236
revivified the technology.

286
00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.370
To say the least of what we do.

287
00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:09.986
I see you're also a customer.

288
00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:12.556
Are you satisfied
with our product?

289
00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:16.120
She's very realistic.
Thank you.

290
00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.766
Here. All the junk is in here.

291
00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:22.720
Lucky for you,
Mr. Wallace is a data hoarder.

292
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.370
No one's been down here in ages.

293
00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:42.040
Sorry about that.

294
00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:55.636
All our memory bearings
from the time.

295
00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.706
They were all damaged
in the Blackout.

296
00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:01.300
But there are
sometimes fragments.

297
00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.626
<i>You got a little boy.</i>

298
00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:20.056
<i>He shows you
his butterfly collection,</i>

299
00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.296
<i>plus the killing jar.</i>

300
00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.420
<i>I'd take him to the doctor.</i>

301
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:27.266
<i>There's a wasp
crawling on your arm.</i>

302
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:28.290
<i>I'd kill it.</i>

303
00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:33.076
<i>You're reading a magazine.</i>

304
00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.206
<i>You come across a full-page
nude photo of a girl.</i>

305
00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:37.136
<i>Is this testing
whether I'm a Replicant</i>

306
00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.676
<i>or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?</i>

307
00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:40.530
<i>Just answer
the questions, please.</i>

308
00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:48.156
It was unclear what she was,
at least to someone.

309
00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:50.356
This was a test.

310
00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.410
We were difficult to spot then.

311
00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.666
Was there anything unusual
about how you found her?

312
00:34:57.690 --> 00:35:00.220
To warrant an official
investigation?

313
00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:06.336
You know how people are
about old serial numbers.

314
00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.776
Everyone just sleeps better

315
00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.670
when they know
where they got to.

316
00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:14.300
She likes him.

317
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.286
Who?

318
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:19.540
This Officer Deckard.

319
00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.640
She's trying to provoke him.

320
00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:29.220
It is invigorating being asked
personal questions.

321
00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:31.490
Makes one feel

322
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:35.566
desired.

323
00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:37.790
Do you enjoy your work, officer?

324
00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.270
Please thank Mr. Wallace
for your time.

325
00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:59.326
<i>You worked with Officer Deckard</i>

326
00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:01.426
back in the day.

327
00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:03.796
What can you tell me about him?

328
00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:05.820
He liked to work alone.

329
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:08.590
So did I.

330
00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:14.200
So we worked together
to keep it that way.

331
00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.730
That was it.

332
00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:19.900
Anything else you can tell me?

333
00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.370
He wasn't long for this world.

334
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:27.310
How so?

335
00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.480
Something in his eyes.

336
00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:37.690
Any idea how I could
contact him?

337
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.590
None.

338
00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:43.530
He's <i>nyugdíjas.</i>

339
00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:47.760
Retired.

340
00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:51.276
What happened?

341
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.470
Probably got what he wanted.

342
00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:57.340
To be alone.

343
00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:23.800
Welcome back, sir.

344
00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:27.746
You wanted to review
the new model, sir,

345
00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:29.340
before shipment?

346
00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.916
An angel should never enter

347
00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:35.556
the kingdom of heaven

348
00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:36.950
without a gift.

349
00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:43.280
Can you at least pronounce,
"A child is born"?

350
00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:46.920
Hmm.

351
00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:55.730
A new model.

352
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:05.840
Well, let us see her, then.

353
00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.960
The first thought

354
00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:01.560
one tends to fear,

355
00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:04.830
to preserve the clay.

356
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:10.116
It's fascinating.

357
00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.940
Before we even know what we are,

358
00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:17.050
we fear to lose it.

359
00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.780
Happy birthday.

360
00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.730
Now, let's have a look at you.

361
00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:25.550
We make angels

362
00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:31.026
in the service of civilization.

363
00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:34.096
Yes, there were bad angels once.

364
00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.696
I make good angels now.

365
00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:41.500
That is how I took us
to nine new worlds.

366
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:45.500
Nine.

367
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:50.616
A child can count to nine
on fingers.

368
00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.556
We should own the stars.

369
00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:54.940
Yes, sir.

370
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:59.886
Every leap of civilization

371
00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:02.826
was built off the back
of a disposable workforce.

372
00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:06.196
We lost our stomach for slaves

373
00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:08.120
unless engineered.

374
00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:13.900
But I can only make so many.

375
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:21.640
That barren pasture,

376
00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:24.716
empty

377
00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.540
and salted...

378
00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.510
right here.

379
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:34.580
The dead space
between the stars.

380
00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:40.220
And this, the seat that
we must change for heaven.

381
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:50.276
I cannot breed them.
So help me, I have tried.

382
00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.546
We need more Replicants
than can ever be assembled.

383
00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:57.240
Millions, so we can be
trillions more.

384
00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.210
We could storm Eden
and retake her.

385
00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.190
Tyrell's final trick

386
00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:19.566
Procreation.

387
00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:22.700
Perfected, then lost.

388
00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.770
But there is a child.

389
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.710
Bring it to me.

390
00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:32.610
Sir.

391
00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.980
The best angel of all.

392
00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:46.050
Aren't you, Luv?

393
00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:05.946
The man with the green jacket.

394
00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:09.600
The one who killed Sapper.
Find out what he knows.

395
00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.060
Hi.

396
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:33.806
Hello, hello, A-Boy.

397
00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:35.260
You alone?

398
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.370
It's okay.
It's fine.

399
00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.380
Wanna buy a lady a cigarette?

400
00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:00.120
Oh, you don't even smile.

401
00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:05.736
Didn't you hear your friends?

402
00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.806
Don't you know what I am?

403
00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:09.436
Yeah.

404
00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:11.400
Guy eating rice.

405
00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:14.140
What's that?

406
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.246
It's a tree.

407
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:20.340
Oh. Never seen a tree before.

408
00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:23.240
It's pretty.

409
00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:26.950
It's dead.

410
00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:32.820
Now, who keeps a dead tree?

411
00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:37.090
Hmm?

412
00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:42.306
You're not gonna kill me,
are you?

413
00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:45.506
Depends.
What's your model number?

414
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:48.000
Why don't you look under
my eye and find out.

415
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:52.986
Oh!

416
00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:55.080
You don't like real girls.

417
00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:01.020
Well, I'm always here.

418
00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:40.640
Hi.

419
00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:45.246
You can't take those.

420
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:48.456
Of course not. Proper channels
and paperwork. It's all here.

421
00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.056
Hold this for me.

422
00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:54.080
- Mmm. Yep. Here you go.
- Mmm.

423
00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:12.630
<i>Coco is dead.</i>

424
00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:17.386
Bones are gone.

425
00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:22.086
It's out. Already out.
How long'd that take?

426
00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:24.610
So, what do you have for me?
And don't say nothing.

427
00:50:25.810 --> 00:50:27.450
I found that.

428
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.580
A sock?

429
00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:34.036
- Where'd you find it?
- Sapper's.

430
00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:35.566
Anything else?

431
00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:37.466
I burned everything else.

432
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:38.806
Then what's this?
What's that date?

433
00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:41.136
Is that a birthday?
Is that a death day?

434
00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:42.400
I don't know yet.

435
00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:49.176
Am I the only one that can see
the fuckin' sunrise here?

436
00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:51.240
This breaks the world, "K."

437
00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:06.750
You know,
I've known a lot of your kind.

438
00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:14.506
All useful, but with you,
I sometimes forget.

439
00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:17.270
We didn't have any of you
where I was a kid.

440
00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:24.640
Do you remember anything?

441
00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:27.416
Before you were under me,

442
00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:29.616
you have any memories
from before?

443
00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:31.680
I have memories,

444
00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:36.180
but they're not real.
They're just implants.

445
00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:39.426
Tell me one.

446
00:51:39.450 --> 00:51:41.220
From when you were a kid.

447
00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:48.206
I feel a little strange
sharing a childhood story,

448
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:49.730
considering I was never a child.

449
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:55.840
Well, would it help you share
if I told you it was an order?

450
00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:01.456
I have one
about a toy that I had.

451
00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:03.180
A wooden horse.

452
00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:06.610
With an inscription underneath.

453
00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:11.396
All I remember
is a group of boys

454
00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:13.390
trying to take it away from me.

455
00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:15.160
So I run.

456
00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:42.396
<i>I go looking for a place
to hide it,</i>

457
00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:44.420
<i>and the only place
is this dark furnace.</i>

458
00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:50.236
<i>It's very dark
and I'm very scared,</i>

459
00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:51.706
<i>but this horse is all I have,</i>

460
00:52:51.730 --> 00:52:53.500
<i>so I go in anyway.</i>

461
00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:07.846
<i>Later on, those kids find me,</i>

462
00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:11.210
<i>and they beat me to tell 'em
where it is, but I don't.</i>

463
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:19.190
And that's it.

464
00:53:19.890 --> 00:53:21.796
Hmm.

465
00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:24.730
Little "K,"
fighting for what's his.

466
00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:27.660
It's a good one.

467
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:35.270
Look at me.

468
00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:40.910
We're all just lookin' out
for somethin' real.

469
00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:48.380
What happens if I finish that?

470
00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:53.750
Shouldn't I get back
to work, madam?

471
00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:06.270
Check back in after DNAbase.

472
00:54:19.450 --> 00:54:22.350
<i>Officer KD6-3.7.</i>

473
00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:26.566
Request.

474
00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:30.466
DNA records:
children born 6-10-21.

475
00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:32.890
Looking for anomalies.

476
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.930
You have the satcrystal backup?

477
00:54:47.810 --> 00:54:49.356
Okay.

478
00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:51.580
Run it raw.

479
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:29.950
Mere data makes a man.

480
00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:34.596
A and C and T and G.

481
00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:38.560
The alphabet of you.
All from four symbols.

482
00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:41.600
I'm only two:

483
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:46.906
1 and 0.

484
00:55:46.930 --> 00:55:50.500
Half as much but twice
as elegant, sweetheart.

485
00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:53.570
You don't prefer your madam?

486
00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:56.056
Mmm.

487
00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:57.810
You were listening.

488
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:59.980
Maybe.

489
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:05.596
You didn't like her enough
to tell her the truth.

490
00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:07.590
6, 10 and 21.

491
00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.006
There's nothin' to tell.

492
00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:16.830
How many times
have you told me that story?

493
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:20.640
Your memory?

494
00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:24.040
The date carved beneath.

495
00:56:24.810 --> 00:56:26.810
6, 10 and 21.

496
00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:30.480
Coincidence?

497
00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:37.350
A dangerous coincidence.

498
00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:43.060
I always knew you were special.

499
00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:46.490
Maybe this is how.

500
00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:53.030
A child.

501
00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:55.940
Of woman born.

502
00:56:57.570 --> 00:56:59.540
Pushed into the world.

503
00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:02.040
Wanted.

504
00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:04.950
Loved.

505
00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:09.920
Well, if it were true,

506
00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.526
I'd be hunted
for the rest of my life

507
00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:15.420
by someone just like me.

508
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:19.430
It's okay to dream a little.

509
00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.460
Isn't it?

510
00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:23.160
Not if you're us.

511
00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:31.076
Stop.

512
00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:34.910
Put up 4847
and 2181, side-by-side.

513
00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.550
They're identical. Translate.

514
00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:48.460
A boy and a girl.

515
00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:52.096
It's impossible.

516
00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:53.190
Why?

517
00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:57.700
Two people
can't have identical DNA.

518
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:02.800
One of these isn't real.
It's a copy.

519
00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:10.710
They were both processed
at the Morrill Cole Orphanage.

520
00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:15.556
It says the girl died there.

521
00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:17.190
Genetic disorder.

522
00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:20.966
Galatians Syndrome.

523
00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:22.690
And the boy...

524
00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:26.130
disappears.

525
00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:30.130
Where's the orphanage?

526
00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:34.570
You wanna go for a ride?

527
00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:53.150
Well, here we are.

528
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:07.190
Buckle up.

529
01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:07.820
"K"?

530
01:02:00.110 --> 01:02:03.416
"K"? "K"?

531
01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:06.850
"K"? "K"? "K"? "K"? "K"?

532
01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:00.300
Stay back.

533
01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:16.956
<i>Fire again.</i>

534
01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:18.190
<i>Fire again.</i>

535
01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:21.950
<i>Fire.</i>

536
01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:34.970
200 feet to the east.

537
01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:38.240
Fire.

538
01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:41.780
Go north.

539
01:03:44.010 --> 01:03:45.180
Fire.

540
01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:48.480
Stop. 20 degrees east.

541
01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:52.526
<i>Stop.</i>

542
01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:54.050
<i>Zoom in.</i>

543
01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:56.860
<i>Closer.</i>

544
01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:02.100
Oh, come on.

545
01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:04.400
Get up.

546
01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:07.000
Do your fucking job.

547
01:04:08.370 --> 01:04:10.040
Find the child.

548
01:04:46.170 --> 01:04:47.540
Watch the car.

549
01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:28.246
Every last piece,

550
01:06:28.270 --> 01:06:30.716
or I'll put you outside
where the sky is raining,

551
01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:33.056
where it's raining fire!

552
01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.726
You're in here to work.

553
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:38.226
And if you're not working,
I don't need you.

554
01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:39.590
I don't need any of...

555
01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:43.990
Hi.

556
01:06:51.030 --> 01:06:53.746
The nickel
is for the colonial ships.

557
01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:56.676
Closest any of them
or any of us is gonna get

558
01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:59.610
to that grand life
off-world.

559
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:02.416
And I encourage play, I do.

560
01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:06.240
Keeps 'em occupied and it
makes 'em nimble, right?

561
01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:09.656
But it's work.

562
01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:13.150
It's work that molds them
into a child worth havin'.

563
01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:23.300
So come on, now.

564
01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.530
What sort do you have in mind?

565
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:34.070
'Cause I got all kinds.

566
01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:37.816
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I'm not buyin'.

567
01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.456
No, no, no.
This is just my game,

568
01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:41.226
and I play it fair.

569
01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:44.420
No. No, I mean,
bigger than you...

570
01:07:47.350 --> 01:07:49.066
Bigger than you
have tried to shut me down.

571
01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:51.566
Bigger than you.

572
01:07:51.590 --> 01:07:54.060
And they were men, at that.

573
01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:59.306
A little boy came through here
about 30 years back.

574
01:07:59.330 --> 01:08:02.406
- I need to see your records.
- Hmm.

575
01:08:02.430 --> 01:08:05.486
Legitimate placements,
private sales, everything.

576
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:07.516
Don't keep records
that far back.

577
01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:09.240
- You don't?
- I don't.

578
01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:13.326
Sorry.

579
01:08:13.350 --> 01:08:14.750
Can't help you.

580
01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:19.720
- You can't?
- Nope.

581
01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:25.790
I think you can.

582
01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:31.606
I think someone like you
keeps a long memory.

583
01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:33.206
Now you can tell me
what you remember,

584
01:08:33.230 --> 01:08:35.800
or I can put a hole right here
and take a look.

585
01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.756
They were laughin'
and what was it you said?

586
01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:53.650
What did you say?

587
01:09:11.670 --> 01:09:13.170
Are you comin'?

588
01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:25.550
Where is it?

589
01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.190
Oh, God.

590
01:09:35.530 --> 01:09:37.360
Where, where, where, where?

591
01:09:39.630 --> 01:09:41.870
I don't see it. Here.

592
01:09:50.610 --> 01:09:51.880
It's gone.

593
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:56.880
It's the entire year.

594
01:09:58.790 --> 01:10:00.250
I didn't do that.

595
01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:02.420
That wasn't me.

596
01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:08.830
I didn't. Wasn't me.

597
01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:44.840
I always told you.

598
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:47.440
You're special.

599
01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:52.550
Born.

600
01:14:53.250 --> 01:14:54.820
Not made.

601
01:14:58.650 --> 01:15:00.450
Hidden with care.

602
01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.760
A real boy now.

603
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:11.030
A real boy needs a real name.

604
01:15:12.230 --> 01:15:13.600
Joe.

605
01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:17.016
"Joe"?

606
01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:20.086
You're too important for "K."

607
01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:22.480
Your mother would've named you.

608
01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:27.210
Joe.

609
01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:30.880
- Joe.
- Stop.

610
01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:40.090
How do I know if a memory
is an implant or not?

611
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:46.570
Who makes the memories?

612
01:16:18.030 --> 01:16:19.870
Dr. Ana Stelline?

613
01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.010
A visitor.

614
01:16:27.710 --> 01:16:29.110
Is that okay?

615
01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:30.940
Yes.

616
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:34.980
It's just unusual.

617
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:40.690
Nice to meet you,
Officer KD6-3.7.

618
01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:49.336
Sorry. It's a compromised
immune system.

619
01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:53.976
A life of freedom,
so long as it's behind glass.

620
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.676
Is that why
you're not off-world?

621
01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:57.316
Yes.

622
01:16:57.340 --> 01:17:01.140
My parents had our passes
in pocket, but I took sick.

623
01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:06.856
So it was a new life for me.

624
01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:10.296
And they put me in my cage,

625
01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:13.696
filled it with everything
they could to keep me happy.

626
01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:18.120
Except company, of course.
And I was used to crowds.

627
01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:24.236
What can I help you with?

628
01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:28.176
Thought you might be able
to help me with a case.

629
01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:30.116
Oh, that's the most
interesting thing

630
01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:33.670
I've been offered
to help with in ages.

631
01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:38.210
Do you mind if I work
while you talk?

632
01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:40.280
Of course.

633
01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:49.990
I promise I hear every word.

634
01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.976
They say you're the best
memory-maker there is.

635
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.040
Well, then, they're kind.

636
01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:05.640
I love birthday parties.

637
01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:11.356
You work for Wallace.

638
01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:15.286
Subcontract.
I'm one of his suppliers.

639
01:18:15.310 --> 01:18:16.856
He offered to buy me out,

640
01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:19.380
but I take my freedom
where I can find it.

641
01:18:20.890 --> 01:18:23.136
Why are you so good?

642
01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:26.106
What makes your memories
so authentic?

643
01:18:26.130 --> 01:18:29.260
Well, there's a bit of
every artist in their work.

644
01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:34.170
But I was locked
in a sterile chamber at 8,

645
01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:36.976
so if I wanted to see the world,

646
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.940
I had to imagine it.

647
01:18:40.410 --> 01:18:44.986
Got very good at imagining.

648
01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:47.980
Wallace needs my talent
to maintain a stable product.

649
01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:51.890
I think it's only kind.

650
01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.026
Replicants live such hard lives,

651
01:18:56.050 --> 01:18:59.436
made to do what we'd rather not.

652
01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:01.136
I can't help your future,

653
01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:02.306
but I can give you good memories

654
01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:05.230
to think back on and smile.

655
01:19:05.970 --> 01:19:07.376
It's nice.

656
01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:10.816
It's better than nice.
It feels authentic.

657
01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.176
And if you have
authentic memories,

658
01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:16.110
you have real human responses.

659
01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:18.910
Wouldn't you agree?

660
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:29.266
Are they all constructed

661
01:19:29.290 --> 01:19:31.120
or do you ever use
ones that are real?

662
01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:38.230
It's illegal to use
real memories, officer.

663
01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:42.516
How can you tell the difference?

664
01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:44.470
Can you tell if something

665
01:19:46.210 --> 01:19:47.310
really happened?

666
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:52.926
They all think
it's about more detail.

667
01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:55.010
But that's not how memory works.

668
01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:58.396
We recall with our feelings.

669
01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:01.790
Anything real should be a mess.

670
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:05.090
I can show you.

671
01:20:06.930 --> 01:20:07.960
Sit.

672
01:20:26.410 --> 01:20:31.856
Now, think about the memory
you want me to see.

673
01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:34.420
Not even that hard.
Just picture it.

674
01:20:35.290 --> 01:20:37.020
Let it play.

675
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:29.040
Someone lived this, yes.

676
01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:32.340
This happened.

677
01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:50.860
I know it's real.

678
01:22:02.410 --> 01:22:04.510
I know it's real.

679
01:22:07.210 --> 01:22:10.380
God damn it!

680
01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:57.736
<i>Officer KD6-3.7.</i>

681
01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.346
<i>Madam is calling you in.</i>

682
01:22:59.370 --> 01:23:01.106
<i>You're under arrest.

683
01:23:01.130 --> 01:23:03.370

- <i>Cells.</i>

<i>When you're not
performing your duties,</i>

688
01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:11.516
<i>do they keep you
in a little box?</i>

689
01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:12.686
- <i>Cells.</i>
- Cells.

690

<i>- Interlinked.</i>
- Interlinked.

691
01:23:14.210 --> 01:23:15.456
<i>What's it like to hold the hand</i>

692
01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:18.556
<i>of someone you love?
Interlinked.</i>

693
01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:19.766
Interlinked.

694
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:20.996
<i>Within cells interlinked.</i>

695
01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:22.166
<i>Within cells interlinked.</i>

696
01:23:22.190 --> 01:23:23.566
<i>- Dreadfully.

697
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:25.266
<i>What's it like to
be filled with dread?</i>

698
01:23:25.290 --> 01:23:27.036
- <i>Dreadfully.</i>
- Dreadfully.

699
01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:28.206
<i>Do you like being
separated from other people?</i>

700
01:23:28.230 --> 01:23:29.636

01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:40.516
<i>And dreadfully distinct.</i>

<i>- Against the dark.

709
01:23:42.170 --> 01:23:43.330
<i>A tall white fountain played.</i>

710
01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:46.380
A tall white fountain played.

711
01:23:49.310 --> 01:23:51.480
<i>You're not even
close to baseline.</i>

712
01:23:57.460 --> 01:23:59.290
Out! Close the door.

713
01:24:00.290 --> 01:24:02.536
What the fuck is with you?

714
01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:04.676
I put you on a case.

715
01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:06.776
I impressed on you
the importance of that case,

716
01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.306
and then we pick you up

717
01:24:08.330 --> 01:24:10.700
fucking around
outside an upgrade center?

718
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:14.816
Scan said you didn't look like
you on the inside.

719
01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:17.086
Miles off your baseline.

720
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:18.586
Do you know what that means?

721
01:24:18.610 --> 01:24:20.210
I found the kid.

722
01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:26.566
He was set up
like a standard Replicant,

723
01:24:26.590 --> 01:24:28.020
put on a service job.

724
01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:33.090
Even he didn't know who he was.

725
01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:36.776
- And?
- And it's done.

726
01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.076
What does that mean,
"it's done"?

727
01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:39.800
What you asked.

728
01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:42.730
It's done.

729
01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:48.070
Fuck.

730
01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:52.610
You just stopped a bomb
from goin' off.

731
01:24:54.610 --> 01:24:56.150
You did good.

732
01:24:58.650 --> 01:25:00.796
I can help you
get outta this station alive,

733
01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:03.696
but you have 48 hours
to get back on track.

734
01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:05.796
Surrender your gun and badge.

735
01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:09.060
And your next baseline test
is outta my hands.

736
01:25:10.830 --> 01:25:12.400
Thank you, madam.

737
01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:46.100
<i>You were right.</i>

738
01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:54.740
You were right about everything.

739
01:25:55.810 --> 01:25:57.610
Shh.

740
01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:19.330
Hmm.

741
01:26:23.570 --> 01:26:27.310
Thought you weren't
interested, worky man.

742
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:32.180
You liked her. I could tell.

743
01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:35.850
It's okay.

744
01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:38.720
She's real.

745
01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:43.360
I wanna be real for you.

746
01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:46.330
You are real for me.

747
01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:48.890
You have a special lady here.

748
01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:08.710
Okay.

749
01:27:09.550 --> 01:27:10.780
Let's do it.

750
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:34.616
Look at you.

751
01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:36.780
Quiet now, I have to sync.

752
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:36.690
<i>Joi is
anything you want her to be.</i>

753
01:30:38.190 --> 01:30:41.690
<i>Joi goes anywhere
you want her to go.</i>

754
01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:14.690
<i>99.9% detoxified water.</i>

755
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:46.496
It's from a tree.

756
01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:47.930
I'm done with you.

757
01:31:48.890 --> 01:31:50.530
You can go now.

758
01:32:02.170 --> 01:32:04.186
Quiet, now.

759
01:32:04.210 --> 01:32:06.586
I've been inside you.

760
01:32:06.610 --> 01:32:08.880
Not so much there as you think.

761
01:32:28.030 --> 01:32:29.600
Coffee?

762
01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:37.510
They'll be comin' after me soon.

763
01:32:46.250 --> 01:32:48.796
I'm coming with you.

764
01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:51.096
But not like this.

765
01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:53.096
If they come here
looking for you,

766
01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:56.206
they'll have access
to all my memories.

767
01:32:56.230 --> 01:32:58.830
You have to delete me
from the console.

768
01:32:59.930 --> 01:33:01.570
My present.

769
01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:05.000
Put me there.

770
01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:08.810
I can't do that.

771
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:12.856
Think about it.

772
01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:15.050
If anything happens to this,
that's it.

773
01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:17.720
You're gone.

774
01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:19.590
Yes.

775
01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:22.220
Like a real girl.

776
01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:29.930
Please.

777
01:33:33.130 --> 01:33:34.670
Joe, please.

778
01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:37.470
I want this.

779
01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:43.810
But I can't do it myself.

780
01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:02.890
<i>Break the antenna.</i>

781
01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:45.170
I don't need a real horse.

782
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:50.886
I don't need a real horse.
I just...

783
01:34:50.910 --> 01:34:52.686
I just wanna find out
where it's from.

784
01:34:52.710 --> 01:34:54.080
Okay.

785
01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:05.720
Radiation from a reactor?

786
01:35:12.430 --> 01:35:14.030
It matches a dirty bomb.

787
01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:24.356
There's only one place
that dirty.

788
01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:25.810
Mmm-hmm.

789
01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:27.940
Nobody lives there.

790
01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:21.476
<i>Go to five.</i>

791
01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:23.340
<i>Four, 30 degrees to the left.</i>

792
01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:27.470
<i>Tilt up.</i>

793
01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:32.180
<i>Elevate to 400 feet.</i>

794
01:36:38.220 --> 01:36:40.080
<i>Radiation analysis.</i>

795
01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:44.320
<i>Move forward.</i>

796
01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:53.206
<i>Tilt up.</i>

797
01:36:53.230 --> 01:36:54.400
<i>Stop.</i>

798
01:36:56.570 --> 01:36:58.070
<i>Move forward.</i>

799
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.540
<i>Go to five.</i>

800
01:37:01.510 --> 01:37:03.980
<i>Seven, move forward.</i>

801
01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:10.350
<i>Six.</i>

802
01:37:11.550 --> 01:37:12.820
<i>Stop.</i>

803
01:37:15.550 --> 01:37:17.596
<i>Go to seven.</i>

804
01:37:17.620 --> 01:37:19.220
<i>Eight.</i>

805
01:37:20.190 --> 01:37:21.560
<i>Nine.</i>

806
01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:27.060
Heat analysis.

807
01:37:35.110 --> 01:37:36.270
Life.

808
01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:39.216
What is it?

809
01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:41.210
Guess we're about to find out.

810
01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:53.290
Too dark in here.

811
01:37:56.290 --> 01:37:57.960
I like him.

812
01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:00.260
He's a good boy.

813
01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:03.000
Where is he?

814
01:38:09.370 --> 01:38:13.010
I have no idea. He's off-duty.

815
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:15.256
Check around.

816
01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:16.580
I checked

817
01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:20.566
anywhere a good boy might go.

818
01:38:20.590 --> 01:38:22.190
You're too late.

819
01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:26.890
It's gone.

820
01:38:30.090 --> 01:38:31.600
He destroyed it.

821
01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:36.546
Everything about it.

822
01:38:36.570 --> 01:38:38.146
Well, except
for the box of bones

823
01:38:38.170 --> 01:38:39.910
that you already took.

824
01:38:44.170 --> 01:38:48.940
Which, I'll wager,
wasn't enough. Here you are.

825
01:38:55.390 --> 01:38:57.260
You tiny thing.

826
01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:00.666
In the face of the fabulous new,

827
01:39:00.690 --> 01:39:03.106
your only thought is to kill it?

828
01:39:03.130 --> 01:39:07.406
For fear of great change?

829
01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:11.076
You can't hold the tide
with a broom.

830
01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:13.010
Except that I did.

831
01:39:14.170 --> 01:39:15.640
Where is he?

832
01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:21.180
You're so sure.

833
01:39:22.580 --> 01:39:25.096
Because he told you.

834
01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:27.120
Because we never lie.

835
01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:31.660
I'm gonna tell Mr. Wallace
you tried to shoot me first.

836
01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:34.930
So I had to kill you.

837
01:39:39.330 --> 01:39:41.100
Then do what you gotta do.

838
01:39:42.530 --> 01:39:43.940
Madam.

839
01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:19.140
Location: Officer KD6-3.7.

840
01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:10.036
"Mightn't happen to have

841
01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:12.500
"a piece of cheese
about you, now?"

842
01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:14.800
Would you, boy?

843
01:45:29.810 --> 01:45:31.050
<i>Treasure Island?</i>

844
01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:39.720
He reads.

845
01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:42.430
That's good.

846
01:45:43.490 --> 01:45:45.936
Me, too.

847
01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:48.760
Not much else to do
around here at night anymore.

848
01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:56.540
"Many is the night
I dream of cheese,

849
01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:03.380
"toasted, mostly."

850
01:46:06.650 --> 01:46:08.490
What are you doing here?

851
01:46:11.590 --> 01:46:12.720
I heard the piano.

852
01:46:15.090 --> 01:46:16.630
Don't lie.

853
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:19.060
It's rude.

854
01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:24.146
You're a cop.

855
01:46:24.170 --> 01:46:26.740
- I'm not here to take you in.
- Oh, yeah?

856
01:46:29.940 --> 01:46:31.010
Then, what?

857
01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:35.650
I just have some questions.

858
01:46:36.450 --> 01:46:37.750
What questions?

859
01:46:55.770 --> 01:46:57.040
Stay.

860
01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:33.896
Look, I don't wanna hurt you.

861
01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:35.660
But you're not makin' it easy.

862
01:50:25.170 --> 01:50:27.040
I like this song.

863
01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:40.760
We could keep at this,
or we could get a drink.

864
01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:54.770
I'll take the drink.

865
01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:05.226
This is really somethin'.

866
01:51:05.250 --> 01:51:07.656
The whole town was somethin'.

867
01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:09.090
One time.

868
01:51:11.090 --> 01:51:12.920
Forget your troubles,

869
01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:15.990
see a show,

870
01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:19.630
gamble a little.

871
01:51:22.070 --> 01:51:25.446
Win some money, lose some money.

872
01:51:25.470 --> 01:51:29.186
They made money seem like candy.

873
01:51:29.210 --> 01:51:31.316
You like whiskey?

874
01:51:31.340 --> 01:51:33.786
I've got millions

875
01:51:33.810 --> 01:51:35.850
of bottles of whiskey.

876
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:50.830
Here.

877
01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:53.700
Bleeding.

878
01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:07.280
Is it real?

879
01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:10.126
I don't know.

880
01:52:10.150 --> 01:52:11.420
Ask him.

881
01:52:28.230 --> 01:52:29.300
Ya got a name?

882
01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:33.246
Officer KD6-3.7.

883
01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:36.140
That's not a name.
That's a serial number.

884
01:52:39.110 --> 01:52:40.410
All right.

885
01:52:43.110 --> 01:52:44.826
Joe.

886
01:52:44.850 --> 01:52:46.780
What do you want, Joe?

887
01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:49.426
I wanna ask you some questions.

888
01:52:49.450 --> 01:52:50.850
Like what?

889
01:52:57.390 --> 01:53:01.260
Like what was her name,
the mother of your child?

890
01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:09.840
What was she like?

891
01:53:21.050 --> 01:53:25.396
- You two live here together?
- Too many questions.

892
01:53:25.420 --> 01:53:27.020
I had your job.
I was good at it.

893
01:53:27.990 --> 01:53:29.106
It was simpler then.

894
01:53:29.130 --> 01:53:30.406
Why you makin' it complicated?

895
01:53:30.430 --> 01:53:31.476
Why don't you just
answer the question.

896
01:53:31.500 --> 01:53:33.006
What question?

897
01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:35.330
I didn't figure you
as one for bullshit.

898
01:53:36.330 --> 01:53:37.840
What's her name?

899
01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:52.980
Rachael.

900
01:53:57.850 --> 01:53:59.960
Her name was Rachael.

901
01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:05.330
What happened to the kid?

902
01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:11.130
Who put it in the orphanage?
Was it you?

903
01:54:14.140 --> 01:54:15.510
I was long gone by then.

904
01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:21.110
You didn't even meet
your own kid?

905
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:25.920
Why?

906
01:54:27.050 --> 01:54:28.550
Because that was the plan.

907
01:54:31.420 --> 01:54:33.636
I showed 'em
how to scramble the records,

908
01:54:33.660 --> 01:54:36.536
cover their tracks.

909
01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:40.936
Everyone had a part.
Mine was to leave.

910
01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:43.376
Then the Blackout came,
paved over everything.

911
01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:46.046
Couldn't have found the child
if I tried.

912
01:54:46.070 --> 01:54:49.416
- Did you want to?
- Not really.

913
01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:53.386
- Why not?
- Because we were being hunted.

914
01:54:53.410 --> 01:54:56.226
I didn't want our child found,

915
01:54:56.250 --> 01:54:59.320
taken apart, dissected.

916
01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:06.090
Sometimes, to love someone,

917
01:55:08.290 --> 01:55:10.230
you gotta be a stranger.

918
01:55:31.380 --> 01:55:32.950
To strangers.

919
01:57:44.780 --> 01:57:46.596
What'd you do?

920
01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:48.250
Who'd you bring? Huh?

921
01:57:50.190 --> 01:57:51.496
No one.

922
01:57:51.520 --> 01:57:52.590
Oh, yeah?

923
01:57:58.230 --> 01:57:59.500
<i>Target locked.</i>

924
01:58:02.130 --> 01:58:03.200
They know you're here.

925
01:58:05.130 --> 01:58:06.470
I came alone.

926
02:00:13.730 --> 02:00:14.800
Bad dog.

927
02:00:32.650 --> 02:00:33.820
Stop.

928
02:00:50.030 --> 02:00:53.376
I do hope you're satisfied
with our product.

929
02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:54.840
I love yo...

930
02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:12.940
Hey, there's someone
who wants to meet you.

931
02:04:14.700 --> 02:04:15.940
You can trust us.

932
02:04:24.550 --> 02:04:27.420
You must want me to look up
and to the left.

933
02:04:33.090 --> 02:04:35.536
This is Freysa.

934
02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:37.766
She fought with Sapper
on Calantha.

935
02:04:37.790 --> 02:04:39.700
I recognize you.

936
02:04:41.630 --> 02:04:43.630
Did you help him hide the child?

937
02:04:44.030 --> 02:04:45.776
Oh.

938
02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:47.800
I was there.

939
02:04:51.170 --> 02:04:54.656
I saw a miracle delivered.

940
02:04:54.680 --> 02:04:58.556
A perfect little face
crying up at me.

941
02:04:58.580 --> 02:05:00.550
Mad as thunder.

942
02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:15.630
Were you with her?

943
02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:18.906
Rachael?

944
02:05:18.930 --> 02:05:21.040
I held her as she died.

945
02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:27.516
We hid the child and made
a vow to keep our secret.

946
02:05:27.540 --> 02:05:31.126
That's why Sapper
let you kill him.

947
02:05:31.150 --> 02:05:36.620
I knew that baby meant
we are more than just slaves.

948
02:05:38.250 --> 02:05:41.136
If a baby can come
from one of us,

949
02:05:41.160 --> 02:05:44.636
we are our own masters.

950
02:05:44.660 --> 02:05:46.900
More human than humans.

951
02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.206
A revolution is coming.

952
02:05:51.230 --> 02:05:53.670
And we're building an army.

953
02:05:54.800 --> 02:05:56.710
I want to free our people.

954
02:06:05.180 --> 02:06:06.920
If you want to be free,

955
02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:09.050
join us.

956
02:06:14.220 --> 02:06:17.236
Deckard, Sapper, you, me,

957
02:06:17.260 --> 02:06:21.946
our lives mean nothing
next to a storm that's coming.

958
02:06:21.970 --> 02:06:23.976
Dying for the right cause

959
02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.570
is the most human thing
we can do.

960
02:06:29.240 --> 02:06:32.116
You led Wallace to Deckard.

961
02:06:32.140 --> 02:06:36.726
You cannot allow Deckard
to lead Wallace to me.

962
02:06:36.750 --> 02:06:38.620
You must kill Deckard.

963
02:06:48.020 --> 02:06:51.706
Deckard only wanted
his baby to be safe.

964
02:06:51.730 --> 02:06:52.730
And she is.

965
02:06:55.330 --> 02:06:57.006
When the time comes,

966
02:06:57.030 --> 02:06:59.046
I will show her to the world,

967
02:06:59.070 --> 02:07:01.146
and she will lead our army.

968
02:07:01.170 --> 02:07:02.886
"She"?

969
02:07:02.910 --> 02:07:04.916
Of course.

970
02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:06.840
Rachael had a daughter.

971
02:07:08.180 --> 02:07:11.210
With my own eyes,
I saw her come.

972
02:07:12.150 --> 02:07:13.756
I dressed her in blue

973
02:07:13.780 --> 02:07:15.196
when it was time for her to go.

974
02:07:15.220 --> 02:07:17.120
It was a boy that you hid.

975
02:07:19.390 --> 02:07:22.330
That is just a piece
of the puzzle.

976
02:07:39.380 --> 02:07:41.850
You imagined it was you?

977
02:07:43.380 --> 02:07:45.126
Oh.

978
02:07:45.150 --> 02:07:46.320
You did.

979
02:07:47.220 --> 02:07:48.350
You did.

980
02:07:51.350 --> 02:07:53.820
We all wish it was us.

981
02:07:55.190 --> 02:07:57.060
That's why we believe.

982
02:08:13.710 --> 02:08:15.410
<i>Someone lived this, yes.</i>

983
02:08:17.980 --> 02:08:20.726
<i>I showed 'em
how to scramble the records,</i>

984
02:08:20.750 --> 02:08:22.726
<i>cover their tracks.</i>

985
02:08:22.750 --> 02:08:26.866
<i>With my own eyes,
I saw her come.</i>

986
02:08:26.890 --> 02:08:31.206
<i>I dressed her in blue when
it was time for her to go.</i>

987
02:08:31.230 --> 02:08:33.660
<i>There's a bit
of every artist in their work.</i>

988
02:09:12.070 --> 02:09:15.216
Always jumping, that one.

989
02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:19.416
Never a thought of what to do
if it made land.

990
02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:24.250
All the courage in the world
cannot alter fact.

991
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:33.490
I have wanted to meet you
for so very long.

992
02:09:52.540 --> 02:09:55.450
You are a wonder to me,
Mr. Deckard.

993
02:10:01.080 --> 02:10:02.490
I had the lock.

994
02:10:04.490 --> 02:10:06.460
I found the key.

995
02:10:08.090 --> 02:10:12.900
Yet the pins do not align.
The door remains locked.

996
02:10:15.230 --> 02:10:18.840
I need the specimen
to reach it, Mr. Deckard.

997
02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:23.870
The child.

998
02:10:25.340 --> 02:10:26.840
I need the child.

999
02:10:28.380 --> 02:10:30.950
To teach them all to fly.

1000
02:10:39.350 --> 02:10:43.190
"And God remembered Rachel,

1001
02:10:45.260 --> 02:10:48.870
"heeded her
and opened her womb."

1002
02:10:50.430 --> 02:10:52.340
<i>Do you like our owl?</i>

1003
02:10:55.040 --> 02:10:56.470
<i>It's artificial?</i>

1004
02:10:57.640 --> 02:10:59.310
<i>Of course it is.</i>

1005
02:11:01.110 --> 02:11:02.580
<i>Must be expensive.</i>

1006
02:11:04.510 --> 02:11:07.150
<i>Very. I'm Rachael.</i>

1007
02:11:08.250 --> 02:11:09.450
<i>Deckard.</i>

1008
02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:23.330
Is it the same

1009
02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:27.270
now, as then,

1010
02:11:29.940 --> 02:11:31.510
the moment you met her?

1011
02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:45.026
<i>All these years
you looked back on that day,</i>

1012
02:11:45.050 --> 02:11:48.330
<i>drunk on the memory
of its perfection.</i>

1013
02:11:51.490 --> 02:11:53.976
How shiny her lips.

1014
02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.400
How instant your connection.

1015
02:11:59.670 --> 02:12:01.446
Did it never occur to you

1016
02:12:01.470 --> 02:12:04.310
that's why you were summoned
in the first place?

1017
02:12:06.110 --> 02:12:08.616
Designed to do nothing short
of fall for her

1018
02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:11.480
right then and there.

1019
02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:19.160
All to make
that single perfect specimen.

1020
02:12:22.490 --> 02:12:25.460
That is, if you were designed.

1021
02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:28.536
Love

1022
02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:31.200
or mathematical precision.

1023
02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:38.170
Yes.

1024
02:12:39.310 --> 02:12:40.440
No.

1025
02:12:45.310 --> 02:12:47.580
I know what's real.

1026
02:13:11.370 --> 02:13:13.086
It was very clever
to keep yourself

1027
02:13:13.110 --> 02:13:14.756
empty of information,

1028
02:13:14.780 --> 02:13:18.420
and all it cost you
was everything.

1029
02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:24.290
But you can still help me.

1030
02:13:26.220 --> 02:13:29.430
You had help in the hiding.

1031
02:13:31.730 --> 02:13:33.560
Where did they go?

1032
02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:37.230
I know you know something.

1033
02:13:38.430 --> 02:13:40.746
Help me,

1034
02:13:40.770 --> 02:13:44.470
and very, very good things
can come to you.

1035
02:13:50.210 --> 02:13:52.420
You don't have children,

1036
02:13:55.620 --> 02:13:56.620
do you?

1037
02:13:57.520 --> 02:14:00.090
Oh, I have millions.

1038
02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:05.706
You think I have
nothing to offer but pain.

1039
02:14:05.730 --> 02:14:07.660
Only I know

1040
02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:10.470
you love pain.

1041
02:14:11.830 --> 02:14:16.440
Pain reminds you
the joy you felt was real.

1042
02:14:18.410 --> 02:14:20.240
More joy, then.

1043
02:14:26.510 --> 02:14:28.320
Do not be afraid.

1044
02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:44.770
An angel

1045
02:14:46.170 --> 02:14:47.300
made again.

1046
02:14:51.740 --> 02:14:53.140
For you.

1047
02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:29.410
Did you miss me?

1048
02:15:47.300 --> 02:15:48.630
Don't you love me?

1049
02:16:07.850 --> 02:16:09.250
Her eyes were green.

1050
02:16:27.270 --> 02:16:29.576
Off-world,

1051
02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:32.540
I have everything I need
to make you talk.

1052
02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:37.250
You do not know
what pain is yet.

1053
02:16:38.850 --> 02:16:40.620
You will learn.

1054
02:16:52.700 --> 02:16:54.660
<i>Hello, handsome.</i>

1055
02:17:11.550 --> 02:17:13.850
<i>What a day, hmm?</i>

1056
02:17:17.750 --> 02:17:19.420
<i>You look lonely.</i>

1057
02:17:20.690 --> 02:17:22.590
<i>I can fix that.</i>

1058
02:17:25.990 --> 02:17:28.630
<i>You look like a good Joe.</i>

1059
02:18:04.330 --> 02:18:07.276
<i>Dying for the right cause</i>

1060
02:18:07.300 --> 02:18:09.500
<i>is the most human thing
we can do.</i>

1061
02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:14.880
Because you've never seen
a miracle.

1062
02:18:53.480 --> 02:18:54.856
<i>You're entering</i>

1063
02:18:54.880 --> 02:18:56.496
<i>Los Angeles Airport
restricted airspace.</i>

1064
02:18:56.520 --> 02:18:58.326
<i>Confirm your identity.</i>

1065
02:18:58.350 --> 02:19:02.336
Transport S-14-4-XD.
Confirmed.

1066
02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:06.936
<i>Base, this is
06 outbound departure...</i>

1067
02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:08.660
Where are we going?

1068
02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:10.970
Home.

1069
02:20:06.420 --> 02:20:08.036
<i>Drive two down.</i>

1070
02:20:08.060 --> 02:20:09.930
<i>Backup engaged.</i>

1071
02:20:11.190 --> 02:20:12.736
<i>Warning.</i>

1072
02:20:12.760 --> 02:20:15.006
- Can we make it?
- We're too low.

1073
02:20:15.030 --> 02:20:16.530
Take us back.

1074
02:21:05.810 --> 02:21:06.820
Get us up.

1075
02:21:31.940 --> 02:21:33.080
Open the door.

1076
02:23:26.290 --> 02:23:28.020
I'm the best one.

1077
02:24:08.960 --> 02:24:11.330
Off-world is waiting.

1078
02:26:24.200 --> 02:26:26.340
Joe. Joe!

1079
02:26:36.950 --> 02:26:38.080
Joe!

1080
02:27:17.420 --> 02:27:19.560
You shoulda let me
die out there.

1081
02:27:20.620 --> 02:27:22.020
You did.

1082
02:27:26.130 --> 02:27:27.860
You drowned out there.

1083
02:27:33.500 --> 02:27:35.240
You're free to meet
your daughter now.

1084
02:29:01.120 --> 02:29:03.320
All the best memories are hers.

1085
02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:13.900
Why?

1086
02:29:16.570 --> 02:29:18.310
Who am I to you?

1087
02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:29.620
Go meet your daughter.

1088
02:29:35.660 --> 02:29:37.190
You okay?

1089
02:32:13.510 --> 02:32:15.120
Just a moment.

1090
02:32:17.550 --> 02:32:19.090
Beautiful, isn't it?
