1
00:01:24.698 --> 00:01:26.616
Test, test, test.

2
00:01:27.742 --> 00:01:29.577
This is a test.

3
00:01:29.786 --> 00:01:32.706
One, two, test.

4
00:01:45.176 --> 00:01:47.095
Kid?

5
00:01:50.557 --> 00:01:52.809
Are you lost, kid?

6
00:02:51.534 --> 00:02:56.706
- Hi. Where's your big brother, kid?
- I don't have one.

7
00:02:56.915 --> 00:02:59.959
Yeah? Don't you look a little
too kiddy like to be in college?

8
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.212
You still wetting the bed?

9
00:03:02.712 --> 00:03:04.756
Oh, congratulations. Now, here's the deal.

10
00:03:04.964 --> 00:03:09.886
I listen to ska music, right? Just ska.

11
00:03:10.011 --> 00:03:11.971
No rap, punk, hip-hop, heavy metal...

12
00:03:12.097 --> 00:03:14.849
classical, classic rock,
new wave, New Age...

13
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.645
bluegrass, blues, jazz
and no fucking country.

14
00:03:18.812 --> 00:03:21.397
I am not bumpkin like
the rest of you pukes.

15
00:03:21.564 --> 00:03:25.527
And I get the bottom bunk.

16
00:03:52.303 --> 00:03:55.056
-Better watch your ass, punk!-Yeah, punk.

17
00:03:55.348 --> 00:03:57.539
You see us again, you'd
better watch out, kid.

18
00:03:57.767 --> 00:03:59.894
Yeah, kid.

19
00:04:25.378 --> 00:04:29.340
Hello, my name is Jones Dillon.
I'm calling about the apartment.

20
00:04:29.465 --> 00:04:31.801
I can show it to you
now. Tomorrow's fine too.

21
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.344
No, now would be good.

22
00:05:08.004 --> 00:05:12.008
I got the St. Louis blues.

23
00:05:12.175 --> 00:05:17.096
And I'm blue as I can be.

24
00:05:18.097 --> 00:05:21.851
-Because my baby... That's
very pretty, miss.

25
00:05:22.477 --> 00:05:24.604
Oh, thank you.

26
00:05:24.812 --> 00:05:28.024
I don't know. Aren't you a little
young to rent an apartment?

27
00:05:28.233 --> 00:05:30.485
No, miss. I'm a legitimate border.

28
00:05:31.986 --> 00:05:34.656
- What's that there?
- Just my things.

29
00:05:34.822 --> 00:05:39.911
I see, but most people I rent to like
to see the place before they take it.

30
00:05:40.078 --> 00:05:41.496
Okay.

31
00:05:56.094 --> 00:06:00.265
There are two white girls upstairs,
and a white man has the first floor.

32
00:06:00.431 --> 00:06:04.394
You'll be just fine here,
Jones. Snug like a bug.

33
00:06:06.854 --> 00:06:08.606
Thank you.

34
00:06:22.328 --> 00:06:25.081
-What is this?-My rent check?

35
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:29.043
-Twelve thousand dollars?-Well,
that was the figure on the lease.

36
00:06:32.297 --> 00:06:36.009
It's my grandfather's
money. Or it was, anyway.

37
00:06:36.175 --> 00:06:39.012
He went to college here,
and the will said I had to too.

38
00:06:39.178 --> 00:06:40.805
I didn't want to go to Texas.

39
00:06:41.055 --> 00:06:44.642
-What's in Texas?-Just my mother.

40
00:07:13.588 --> 00:07:15.965
You'll be glad to know I
dropped out of college.

41
00:07:16.174 --> 00:07:17.842
You told me all a writer needs...

42
00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:20.803
is his eyes and ears and
sense enough to use them.

43
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.766
Besides, you know I don't
play well with the other kids.

44
00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:29.479
-Better watch your ass, punk!-Yeah, punk.

45
00:08:06.849 --> 00:08:09.977
You know how much this
means to me. Don't be like that.

46
00:08:10.144 --> 00:08:15.191
Look, I'll be here... Don't be this way.

47
00:08:16.109 --> 00:08:18.027
I'll just hang up right now.

48
00:08:18.611 --> 00:08:21.906
I'm hanging up now! Asshole!

49
00:08:53.312 --> 00:08:55.398
Well, well, well. Come in, come in.

50
00:08:55.565 --> 00:08:58.137
I don't know what you're
after, but make no mistake...

51
00:08:58.234 --> 00:09:01.362
you have come to absolutely
the right place to get it.

52
00:09:01.529 --> 00:09:05.741
You can call me "Mother." I am the
woman of this house. And you I call...?

53
00:09:06.284 --> 00:09:08.536
Jones. Jones Dillon.

54
00:09:09.245 --> 00:09:11.706
You listen to Mother,
because she speaks the truth.

55
00:09:11.914 --> 00:09:16.335
There is nothing, absolutely
nothing as important as a bed.

56
00:09:16.544 --> 00:09:18.963
-Nothing?-Nothing.

57
00:09:20.214 --> 00:09:23.801
A happy bed makes for a
happy home, Mr. Jones...

58
00:09:24.051 --> 00:09:26.471
if you take my meaning.

59
00:09:28.222 --> 00:09:30.558
Jones.

60
00:09:31.142 --> 00:09:36.230
Jones. I knew a man named
Jones once. Yes, indeed.

61
00:09:36.439 --> 00:09:38.441
Maybe he was your daddy.

62
00:09:39.567 --> 00:09:43.654
-I doubt it, miss.-Well, I
wouldn't be too sure, now.

63
00:09:43.988 --> 00:09:47.158
He was a handsome devil, just like you are.

64
00:09:56.751 --> 00:10:00.880
-Phone?-I don't have one yet. I'll get one.

65
00:10:01.047 --> 00:10:06.219
Well, you be sure and let Mother
know just as soon as you do.

66
00:10:06.385 --> 00:10:10.306
-Hi, Mother.-Oh, boys, this is Mr. Jones.

67
00:10:10.431 --> 00:10:13.434
Will you tell him when you
can deliver him his furniture?

68
00:10:13.643 --> 00:10:16.072
-Be a week at least.-Be at
least a week, maybe two.

69
00:10:16.229 --> 00:10:19.190
-Could be two.-That's okay. Fine.

70
00:10:19.774 --> 00:10:22.443
-We aren�t asking.-No
one's asking you nothing.

71
00:10:22.568 --> 00:10:24.140
Now, you boys shut the hell up...

72
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.323
talking to my customers
like that. Now, get out.

73
00:10:27.448 --> 00:10:30.826
-Sorry, Mother.-Go on.

74
00:10:31.035 --> 00:10:32.453
Get.

75
00:10:33.037 --> 00:10:35.790
From my second husband.

76
00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.897
Kid, you aren�t 21.

77
00:11:00.106 --> 00:11:04.610
Twenty-two, 23 in
December. You can see there.

78
00:11:10.866 --> 00:11:16.455
My mother, she was deep
into all of it: Booze, pills...

79
00:11:16.664 --> 00:11:19.000
everything she could get her hands on.

80
00:11:19.208 --> 00:11:21.544
I was born 10 weeks premature.

81
00:11:21.752 --> 00:11:24.213
By the time doctors
discovered the bone disease...

82
00:11:24.338 --> 00:11:26.757
it was too late to treat properly.

83
00:11:27.341 --> 00:11:30.344
I've been suffering
since before I was born.

84
00:11:31.637 --> 00:11:33.723
Damn.

85
00:11:33.931 --> 00:11:36.017
Do you need anything else?

86
00:11:37.893 --> 00:11:41.606
-A pack of cigarettes.-Just
a second. Anything else?

87
00:11:43.357 --> 00:11:45.443
A pack of cigarettes.

88
00:12:08.507 --> 00:12:10.468
Scheiss auto.

89
00:12:37.703 --> 00:12:39.413
Shit.

90
00:12:42.458 --> 00:12:44.251
Brad?

91
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.505
Come on.

92
00:12:53.886 --> 00:12:55.096
Hi. I'm...

93
00:12:59.684 --> 00:13:02.353
Think you can mess with
me, you little bastard?

94
00:13:04.814 --> 00:13:06.857
Think you can?

95
00:13:12.446 --> 00:13:14.657
-Hi, Jane.-Hi, Brad.

96
00:13:15.574 --> 00:13:17.910
-Who's your friend?-Asshole
tried to attack me.

97
00:13:18.119 --> 00:13:21.122
Bad boy. Think I should shoot him?

98
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.708
No, I'll do it.

99
00:13:25.084 --> 00:13:28.421
Well, well, well. Look here.

100
00:13:29.213 --> 00:13:33.175
-Caught yourself a deviant,
did you?-I live here, you lunatics.

101
00:13:34.135 --> 00:13:37.722
-What?-Boy says he lives here, miss.

102
00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:41.308
I'm in 2B, upstairs. I just moved in.

103
00:13:42.101 --> 00:13:44.186
He's making it up.

104
00:13:44.854 --> 00:13:50.693
-Listen, hot stuff, are you
2B or not?-Yes, damn. I'm 2B.

105
00:13:50.901 --> 00:13:52.987
Well, all right. I just got you wired up...

106
00:13:53.112 --> 00:13:55.781
for the great wide
world and everything in it.

107
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.374
I saw the whole thing.

108
00:14:08.961 --> 00:14:11.422
It was a mistake.

109
00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:16.302
-Don't be so sure. Are you okay?-Yeah.

110
00:14:18.971 --> 00:14:20.556
Come on.

111
00:14:35.529 --> 00:14:38.199
This makes us neighbors, I suppose.

112
00:14:38.407 --> 00:14:40.993
-I'm Lisa.-I'm Jones. Hi.

113
00:14:41.202 --> 00:14:45.372
Hi. You can keep them if you
want. Call it a housewarming.

114
00:14:45.581 --> 00:14:46.957
Thank you.

115
00:14:47.708 --> 00:14:50.211
I'd ask you to stay...

116
00:14:50.669 --> 00:14:53.923
And I'd ask you, where would I sit?

117
00:14:56.801 --> 00:14:58.719
You can sit here.

118
00:14:59.261 --> 00:15:02.848
I think it's much too
soon for that, don't you?

119
00:15:03.432 --> 00:15:05.643
Goodbye, Jones.

120
00:15:12.233 --> 00:15:14.902
-Hello?-Hello, Blanche. Guess who.

121
00:15:15.027 --> 00:15:18.280
Lovely, my only begotten son.

122
00:15:18.489 --> 00:15:20.491
They kicked you out of school already?

123
00:15:20.616 --> 00:15:23.369
I wasn't expecting this
call for at least a month.

124
00:15:23.577 --> 00:15:26.372
Relax, Blanche, you'll spill your drink.

125
00:15:26.497 --> 00:15:28.791
I'm calling with good news.

126
00:15:28.916 --> 00:15:30.918
I'm calling from my very own phone...

127
00:15:31.794 --> 00:15:34.588
from the comfort of
my Very own apartment.

128
00:15:34.755 --> 00:15:39.593
You�re what? Have
you lost your mind, Jones?

129
00:15:39.718 --> 00:15:43.389
If there's anyone in this world who
cannot take care of himself, it is you.

130
00:15:43.556 --> 00:15:46.308
-Do you hear me?-No, you're right.

131
00:15:46.433 --> 00:15:49.228
In fact, I've been
interviewing help all week.

132
00:15:49.436 --> 00:15:51.897
I'm leaning towards
this beautiful Asian girl.

133
00:15:52.106 --> 00:15:54.984
-Cantonese.-Cantonese, I mean.

134
00:15:55.109 --> 00:15:57.444
She's expert in ancient massage techniques.

135
00:15:58.362 --> 00:15:59.655
See there? I knew it.

136
00:15:59.864 --> 00:16:03.826
All those prep schools turned you
into a little sex monster, didn't they?

137
00:16:03.951 --> 00:16:07.955
-I called to ask you
something.-Oh, God, here we go.

138
00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.208
I'm going to need a copy of
my birth certificate for school.

139
00:16:11.417 --> 00:16:14.670
Yeah, I bet. Well, have the
school get in touch with me, then.

140
00:16:14.795 --> 00:16:17.715
-I have a right, Blanche.-For
Christ sakes, Jones...

141
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.568
couldn't we have a conversation...

142
00:16:19.592 --> 00:16:22.928
where you didn't dredge pall
the footnotes of your ancestry?

143
00:16:23.137 --> 00:16:25.043
What if I called your father a footnote?

144
00:16:25.097 --> 00:16:27.933
Just don't call him a
manipulative son of a bitch.

145
00:16:28.142 --> 00:16:30.102
I'd hate for us to agree on something.

146
00:16:30.352 --> 00:16:34.648
I think my own father would like
to know where I am, what I'm doing.

147
00:16:34.857 --> 00:16:39.153
It's late. You probably have
school tomorrow. Jones?

148
00:16:39.236 --> 00:16:42.489
Don't you dare... Jones? Well, son of a...

149
00:16:42.615 --> 00:16:44.366
Bitch.

150
00:16:47.578 --> 00:16:50.122
I have done something to make you angry?

151
00:16:50.247 --> 00:16:52.666
No, not you.

152
00:17:07.306 --> 00:17:10.392
Yes, indeed, Mr. Jones.

153
00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:13.646
A happy bed makes for a happy home...

154
00:17:13.771 --> 00:17:19.568
and Mother here is going to show
you just how happy a home can be.

155
00:17:19.693 --> 00:17:25.157
-My bed hasn't been delivered
yet.-Just you leave everything to me.

156
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:29.787
I'd have called first if I had that number.

157
00:17:31.538 --> 00:17:34.875
Yes, indeed, Mr. Jones.

158
00:17:48.097 --> 00:17:50.891
Get comfortable, Mr. Jones.

159
00:17:58.482 --> 00:18:03.612
Oh, Jones, you area handsome devil!

160
00:18:03.821 --> 00:18:06.365
Oh, my. Yes!

161
00:18:12.287 --> 00:18:15.165
Let me feel how happy you are!

162
00:18:17.626 --> 00:18:21.547
Mr. Jones, you're a happy daddy now.

163
00:18:23.257 --> 00:18:25.467
Kinky! Wild!

164
00:18:37.479 --> 00:18:42.568
Mr. Jones. Rough, just like your daddy was.

165
00:18:47.406 --> 00:18:49.241
Jones!

166
00:19:04.048 --> 00:19:05.507
Damn.

167
00:19:12.765 --> 00:19:14.224
Jones!

168
00:19:20.355 --> 00:19:22.191
No, don't!

169
00:19:24.651 --> 00:19:28.655
-One, two...-No!

170
00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.962
Boy, there's something
you probably ought to know.

171
00:19:44.171 --> 00:19:47.174
You got shit-wipe sticking out of your fly.

172
00:19:54.348 --> 00:19:56.725
-Don't. Please.-One, two...

173
00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:57.935
Freeze.

174
00:19:59.311 --> 00:20:02.439
Put it down, fellows. Nice and easy.

175
00:20:03.065 --> 00:20:06.652
We can't very well do nothing,
being as we is frozen and all.

176
00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.071
Bad joke, daddy-o.

177
00:20:09.238 --> 00:20:13.700
One more and I blow your little sister�s
best friend right out of your trousers.

178
00:20:30.968 --> 00:20:32.928
Think they treat all customers that way?

179
00:20:33.178 --> 00:20:36.056
-No, you're just
lucky.-Lucky you were there.

180
00:20:36.181 --> 00:20:38.016
There, that's all of it.-

181
00:20:38.183 --> 00:20:41.562
If you hadn't shown up, I don't
know. Let me get you a beer.

182
00:20:41.687 --> 00:20:45.566
"Freeze." The looks on their faces.

183
00:20:45.732 --> 00:20:48.193
-Hi, Brad.-Who guessed
they could be polite?

184
00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.446
-You go easy on him.-Okay.

185
00:20:55.492 --> 00:20:58.745
Easily the most exciting thing
I�ve ever seen in real life.

186
00:20:58.871 --> 00:21:01.915
-Hi.-Hi. Where is...?

187
00:21:02.124 --> 00:21:03.876
Gone.

188
00:21:04.877 --> 00:21:07.880
Look. Now you can stay.

189
00:21:08.046 --> 00:21:11.300
-You want a beer?-I'm going
to have to take a rain check.

190
00:21:11.508 --> 00:21:13.886
-I have lines to learn.-You're an actress?

191
00:21:14.803 --> 00:21:17.389
The female lead.-

192
00:21:17.556 --> 00:21:20.934
Besides, I still don't
know where I would sit.

193
00:21:21.143 --> 00:21:23.395
Are you sure that's clean?

194
00:21:29.359 --> 00:21:31.862
Your stalker has furniture.

195
00:21:48.253 --> 00:21:49.421
Hi.

196
00:21:51.131 --> 00:21:53.342
You okay?

197
00:21:53.508 --> 00:21:57.304
Yeah, sure. How are you?

198
00:21:58.972 --> 00:22:00.933
Great couch.

199
00:22:05.229 --> 00:22:06.123
Dear Dad: I'm settling
into apartment life just fine.

200
00:22:06.147 --> 00:22:09.650
Dear Dad: I'm settling
into apartment life just fine.

201
00:22:09.816 --> 00:22:13.153
I know it was more your stiletto
move around a lot, place to place...

202
00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.035
but I think I'll stay right
here for now. And why not?

203
00:22:16.198 --> 00:22:19.826
It seems like every time I turn
around, I make new friends.

204
00:22:40.806 --> 00:22:43.809
Jiminy! Let's get!

205
00:22:43.934 --> 00:22:45.894
Oh, I'm coming, I'm coming!

206
00:22:46.061 --> 00:22:48.939
Come on! Come on, baby!

207
00:24:00.927 --> 00:24:05.140
No, no, darling, they�ve
waited long enough. I�ve waited.

208
00:24:05.349 --> 00:24:07.351
Oh, how I've waited for you.

209
00:24:07.476 --> 00:24:11.605
Each day a lifetime centuries
longer than the day before it.

210
00:24:11.772 --> 00:24:13.982
And it would've been...

211
00:24:15.233 --> 00:24:17.110
Would've been...

212
00:24:18.278 --> 00:24:20.364
Almost bearable.

213
00:24:20.572 --> 00:24:22.532
And it would've been almost bearable...

214
00:24:22.699 --> 00:24:26.745
if just once, you'd written me a letter
to tell me that you were still alive...

215
00:24:27.287 --> 00:24:29.956
and that your love
for mews still alive too.

216
00:24:30.791 --> 00:24:34.711
How could I have known you
lost both your arms in battle?

217
00:24:37.589 --> 00:24:40.258
Damn you. Haven't I told
you never to speak of that?

218
00:24:40.592 --> 00:24:44.763
You foolish, proud man!
Don�t you see it doesn't matter?

219
00:24:45.013 --> 00:24:49.267
You can still touch me.
Still a heart to love me.

220
00:24:49.434 --> 00:24:54.106
Still lips to kiss me. You
can touch me without arms...

221
00:24:54.272 --> 00:24:57.776
and I need you to, darling, desperately.

222
00:24:57.984 --> 00:25:02.697
Please touch me. Touch me now.

223
00:25:03.198 --> 00:25:05.951
Touch me right now.

224
00:25:08.453 --> 00:25:13.125
Blah, blah, blah. God, it's awful.

225
00:25:13.291 --> 00:25:15.919
-Well, you're good.-Really?

226
00:25:16.128 --> 00:25:19.047
I mean, not just compared to you?

227
00:25:27.889 --> 00:25:32.936
-A glass, please?-Oh, well,
I don't have any yet. Sorry.

228
00:25:35.439 --> 00:25:39.609
-You know, I find it awfully sad,
really.-Well, I'm going to get some.

229
00:25:39.818 --> 00:25:42.571
No, not that.

230
00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.412
You know, a person can pursue something.

231
00:25:50.579 --> 00:25:53.123
A girl can go after her
dreamland give it her...

232
00:25:53.248 --> 00:25:57.335
energy, labor, sweat, tears...

233
00:25:57.461 --> 00:26:01.715
and this is where it gets her.

234
00:26:01.882 --> 00:26:07.262
A two-room apartment and a
role in some moronic period play.

235
00:26:11.683 --> 00:26:17.522
-Things take time?-Right, things take time.

236
00:26:18.148 --> 00:26:22.903
I suppose, but I can't wait forever.

237
00:26:24.821 --> 00:26:30.702
-Can I ask you something?-Sure.
You can ask me anything.

238
00:26:30.911 --> 00:26:33.288
Who's the girl with the camera?

239
00:26:34.831 --> 00:26:37.876
She's called "Jane." Why?

240
00:26:38.668 --> 00:26:42.130
Well, she took my picture out here.

241
00:26:42.297 --> 00:26:46.218
She didn't say a word, just
took my picture and disappeared.

242
00:26:46.343 --> 00:26:49.471
-It was weird.-She is weird.

243
00:26:49.596 --> 00:26:52.098
You know what? I�d
be careful if I were you.

244
00:26:52.349 --> 00:26:55.852
She took pictures of me
once, and now she hates me.

245
00:26:56.019 --> 00:27:00.273
-Hates you? Why?-I have no idea...

246
00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.276
except I think she�s
maybe slightly insane.

247
00:27:03.902 --> 00:27:05.904
Insane?

248
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:21.605
Hey, this is Steve. I�m
not here right now...

249
00:28:21.771 --> 00:28:23.523
Hello?

250
00:28:46.755 --> 00:28:51.593
Hi, I'm Jones. I'm your
neighbor from down the hall.

251
00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.554
-I think we're past that.-Right.

252
00:28:54.971 --> 00:28:58.162
I noticed you take pictures, and
I can't seem to figure this out...

253
00:28:58.266 --> 00:29:01.519
so I thought maybe you could...

254
00:29:01.645 --> 00:29:04.397
I don't know much about
them. Is this one any good?

255
00:29:04.606 --> 00:29:09.069
Yeah, it's fine. Fine if you're going
to Disneyland with the wife and kids.

256
00:29:09.819 --> 00:29:14.282
Right. Well, I guess I'll have to
planar trip, then. And a wedding.

257
00:29:15.533 --> 00:29:18.828
-Here. Point and shoot.-Right.

258
00:29:19.579 --> 00:29:21.956
How did that picture come out, on the roof?

259
00:29:23.541 --> 00:29:25.502
Not so hot.

260
00:29:26.628 --> 00:29:29.631
-What did you say your name was?-Jones.

261
00:29:30.548 --> 00:29:32.008
I'm Jane.

262
00:29:32.258 --> 00:29:35.136
-Hi.-Bye, Jones.

263
00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:43.478
-Ready?-Ready.

264
00:29:44.854 --> 00:29:48.650
-Beer?-Oh, my, no, no, this calls for wine.

265
00:29:48.817 --> 00:29:53.613
I have a terrific bottle I've been
saving. You have a corkscrew, right?

266
00:29:55.073 --> 00:29:56.241
Damn.

267
00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:07.585
Here, let me. It's a sticky one.

268
00:30:14.759 --> 00:30:16.302
And that's how it started.

269
00:30:16.469 --> 00:30:18.513
She opened the wine and started to pour...

270
00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:22.058
and pour and pour,
like words on a page...

271
00:30:22.183 --> 00:30:25.562
big words like "ambition�
and "inspiration" and "passion".

272
00:30:25.687 --> 00:30:28.648
Me? I didn't say much, but she didn't mind.

273
00:30:28.815 --> 00:30:30.275
She knew I was watching her.

274
00:30:30.483 --> 00:30:34.070
I think she likes to be looked at,
but I wanted to do more than look.

275
00:30:34.279 --> 00:30:37.327
After all, I couldn't type, could
I, if I didn't touch the keys?

276
00:30:37.407 --> 00:30:39.784
And she was so close. It
should have been easy...

277
00:30:39.993 --> 00:30:42.912
but somewhere, somehow,
I think I missed something.

278
00:30:43.121 --> 00:30:44.873
-You know what I mean?-Yeah.

279
00:30:44.998 --> 00:30:47.500
-You do?-No.

280
00:30:47.709 --> 00:30:51.004
-You don't?-I don't know.

281
00:30:53.423 --> 00:30:59.846
I'm sorry. It's late.
I�m drunk. I have to go.

282
00:31:46.351 --> 00:31:48.228
Morning, partner.

283
00:31:53.274 --> 00:31:55.777
Shouldn't I have handcuffs too?

284
00:31:56.236 --> 00:31:59.155
Sorry, partner. I've only got one pair.

285
00:31:59.531 --> 00:32:01.741
Don't you think we should drink them first?

286
00:32:01.991 --> 00:32:06.287
No. You'd never hit them that way.

287
00:32:11.543 --> 00:32:17.423
That's right. Steady.
Use your sight. Line it up.

288
00:32:17.632 --> 00:32:20.760
-Now, what are you going to do?-Squeeze.

289
00:32:20.927 --> 00:32:22.846
Squeeze.

290
00:32:23.513 --> 00:32:26.099
-What are you not going to do?-Pull.

291
00:32:26.266 --> 00:32:29.394
Beautiful. Whenever you're ready.

292
00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.903
Perfect. You squeezed.

293
00:33:39.088 --> 00:33:40.900
-So, what do you think of Lisa?-Lisa?

294
00:33:40.924 --> 00:33:42.686
-So, what do you think of Lisa?-Lisa?

295
00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.470
Yeah, upstairs Lisa.

296
00:33:45.887 --> 00:33:47.805
How do you mean?

297
00:33:47.972 --> 00:33:52.018
-Well, you're seeing her, aren't
you?-Did she say something to you?

298
00:33:52.143 --> 00:33:55.939
No. I just know.

299
00:33:56.689 --> 00:33:59.943
-How?-It's an old house. I know the creaks.

300
00:34:00.109 --> 00:34:01.694
I know what goes on.

301
00:34:01.903 --> 00:34:04.697
When she's in her bathroom
brushing her teeth...

302
00:34:04.906 --> 00:34:06.783
putting on a bit of eye makeup.

303
00:34:07.492 --> 00:34:10.745
I hear her move from
her apartment to yours.

304
00:34:11.037 --> 00:34:14.540
You let her in. She looks great.

305
00:34:14.707 --> 00:34:17.669
She takes a seat on the couch,
makes herself comfortable.

306
00:34:17.835 --> 00:34:22.382
You offer her something to drink
and excuse yourself to the kitchen.

307
00:34:23.466 --> 00:34:25.635
"Mineral water? Or I have a light beer."

308
00:34:25.802 --> 00:34:29.013
"Mineral water, please. In
a glass, if you don't mind?"

309
00:34:29.722 --> 00:34:33.309
-Mineral water?-Oh, come on.

310
00:34:33.476 --> 00:34:36.187
It's not like I'm snooping,
really. I just hear it.

311
00:34:36.354 --> 00:34:41.150
There's a lot of turnover upstairs.
Everybody leaves a story behind.

312
00:34:41.275 --> 00:34:44.654
Now, I could tell those
stories, but I don't.

313
00:34:44.946 --> 00:34:47.699
And I won't tell yours either, Jones.

314
00:34:50.827 --> 00:34:55.999
Together this time. Six on the
left are mine, right are yours.

315
00:34:59.377 --> 00:35:01.713
I love what you're doing with the place.

316
00:35:01.879 --> 00:35:02.880
Thanks.

317
00:35:03.423 --> 00:35:05.383
-It's called acting.-Right.

318
00:35:05.758 --> 00:35:08.636
-That, that...-Thing?

319
00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.889
That thing is a product of...

320
00:35:13.057 --> 00:35:14.434
Product of...

321
00:36:08.446 --> 00:36:13.951
Hello? Hello? I can hear you breathing.

322
00:36:14.118 --> 00:36:15.912
Jane?

323
00:36:23.628 --> 00:36:27.632
-Listen to me, you pathetic
bastard!-How did you know it was me?

324
00:36:27.799 --> 00:36:31.677
You think you're cute, don't
you? Oh, for Christ sakes, Jones.

325
00:36:31.844 --> 00:36:34.555
You know, you cook a
meal for a man just once...

326
00:36:34.722 --> 00:36:36.641
He thinks he can call you on the phone.

327
00:36:36.808 --> 00:36:40.645
What he thinks is that he's
goat God-given right to tell me...

328
00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:44.315
what to do, where to go,
and what time to be there.

329
00:36:44.482 --> 00:36:48.778
Maybe he wants to show youth
world. Istanbul. Mozambique.

330
00:36:48.903 --> 00:36:52.115
-What are you talking about?-You
know what I'm talking about.

331
00:36:52.198 --> 00:36:56.119
My father. You said he'd been
everywhere, seen everything.

332
00:36:56.202 --> 00:37:00.540
That he'd written it all down.
Every sight, every sound.

333
00:37:00.748 --> 00:37:03.918
-So that he could show you
the world.-I never told you that.

334
00:37:04.043 --> 00:37:08.089
He told me that. I remember
more than you think I do.

335
00:37:08.297 --> 00:37:13.594
-I'm getting dressed here,
Jones.-What did you do, Blanche?

336
00:37:13.803 --> 00:37:16.389
What did you do that
was so bade left both of us?

337
00:37:16.514 --> 00:37:18.975
You know, if you gave
school half the energy...

338
00:37:19.142 --> 00:37:22.395
you give this little
genealogy project...

339
00:37:22.937 --> 00:37:25.022
I bet they'd name building after you.

340
00:37:25.231 --> 00:37:26.774
I am taking it seriously.

341
00:37:27.608 --> 00:37:30.862
In fact, there's an
instructor here right now.

342
00:37:31.028 --> 00:37:34.198
-Oh, instructor, hell. What
instructor?-It's art class.

343
00:37:34.532 --> 00:37:36.033
We're doing nudes this week.

344
00:37:36.784 --> 00:37:41.247
But she said I could sketch
some gin bottles for extra credit.

345
00:37:41.581 --> 00:37:43.749
I'll send you one.

346
00:38:11.194 --> 00:38:13.696
How I�ve waited for you.

347
00:38:13.821 --> 00:38:17.700
Each day a lifetime centuries
longer than the day before it.

348
00:38:17.783 --> 00:38:19.641
And it would've been almost bearable...

349
00:38:19.785 --> 00:38:23.956
if just once, you'd written me a
letter to tell me that you were alive...

350
00:38:24.123 --> 00:38:26.584
and that your love
for me was still alive too.

351
00:38:26.792 --> 00:38:28.586
Damn you.

352
00:38:29.629 --> 00:38:31.797
I thought I told you
never to speak of that.

353
00:38:32.381 --> 00:38:33.507
Never!

354
00:38:43.351 --> 00:38:46.395
I know you got it, you chicken shit!

355
00:38:48.439 --> 00:38:52.193
You can still touch me.
Still a heart to love me.

356
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:56.072
Still lips to kiss me. You
can touch me without arms...

357
00:38:58.574 --> 00:39:02.453
and I need you to, darling, desperately.

358
00:39:02.578 --> 00:39:06.415
Please touch me.

359
00:39:10.795 --> 00:39:13.923
Touch me right now!

360
00:39:19.428 --> 00:39:22.348
At least someone's been rehearsing.

361
00:39:25.142 --> 00:39:27.561
It was bad, wasn't it?

362
00:39:28.896 --> 00:39:30.940
You can tell me.

363
00:39:33.484 --> 00:39:34.652
You were good.

364
00:39:36.153 --> 00:39:40.825
Can you say that again, please,
with just a little bit more feeling?

365
00:39:41.033 --> 00:39:42.201
You were good.

366
00:39:46.831 --> 00:39:48.666
Jones?

367
00:39:51.127 --> 00:39:52.628
Will you kiss me?

368
00:39:54.672 --> 00:39:56.048
Okay.

369
00:39:56.215 --> 00:40:00.136
Okay because you want to,
or okay because I asked you to?

370
00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:05.057
-I want to.-Will you do it now, please?

371
00:40:05.558 --> 00:40:07.935
Okay, I will, but...

372
00:40:16.861 --> 00:40:22.366
-Sorry. I'm not very good
at this.-Oh, but you will be.

373
00:40:22.533 --> 00:40:24.577
You will be.

374
00:40:51.812 --> 00:40:54.190
What are you waiting for?

375
00:40:57.234 --> 00:41:00.196
This isn't your first time, is it?

376
00:41:03.074 --> 00:41:04.784
-What?-What?

377
00:41:04.992 --> 00:41:06.786
Are you serious?

378
00:41:07.578 --> 00:41:11.374
Jones, my God. What do you think this is?

379
00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:15.795
-Nothing. I mean... God,
exactly. You know what?

380
00:41:16.003 --> 00:41:18.839
You can't do this with
me. Not like this. I mean...

381
00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:22.176
You're really sweet and
everything, but my God...

382
00:41:22.301 --> 00:41:24.428
how old are you anyway?-Seventeen.

383
00:41:24.595 --> 00:41:29.475
Seventeen? My God, what am
I doing? You know what, Jones?

384
00:41:29.558 --> 00:41:32.937
-You need to fall in love first.-Love?

385
00:41:33.145 --> 00:41:36.399
Yes, love. Seventeen-year-olds
can fall in love.

386
00:41:36.565 --> 00:41:40.319
By the time I was 17, I'd
already loved three or four boys.

387
00:41:40.486 --> 00:41:43.364
-Like really, truly,
loved them.-You're right.

388
00:41:43.614 --> 00:41:46.742
-Of course I'm right.-Trust
me. You don't want to do this.

389
00:41:47.576 --> 00:41:49.870
-You're right.-You think you do, but...

390
00:41:50.913 --> 00:41:53.624
-What did you say?-I said, you're right.

391
00:41:53.791 --> 00:41:57.670
-Right about what?-About this, about us.

392
00:41:57.795 --> 00:42:01.006
-I don't want to, like you said.-What?

393
00:42:06.429 --> 00:42:09.181
Okay, the show's over. I�m
through being an audience.

394
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:12.768
Just looking on and listening. I want
someone who's more than words...

395
00:42:12.852 --> 00:42:17.481
because if I�ve learned anything
so far, it's this: Talk is cheap, partner.

396
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:22.820
So you say it's a party you want?
Hell, woman, I'll show you a party.

397
00:42:22.987 --> 00:42:25.531
What did I say about
coming down and celebrating?

398
00:42:25.614 --> 00:42:28.451
Damn it, I got dishes at
home that need washing.

399
00:42:28.534 --> 00:42:33.080
You done crossed me for the last time.
Speak up, damn it! I'm talking to you!

400
00:42:42.882 --> 00:42:44.425
Oh, dear God, help me.

401
00:42:45.426 --> 00:42:49.138
It's Jones Dillon, coming to kill me.

402
00:42:49.638 --> 00:42:54.810
Please, Dillon. I wasn't
going to hurt her. Honest.

403
00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:58.689
You'd best say goodbye to them
buttons, you no-arm son of a bitch.

404
00:42:59.482 --> 00:43:01.484
Mr. Dillon.

405
00:43:01.859 --> 00:43:04.904
You have a shave scheduled, Mr. Dillon.

406
00:43:06.739 --> 00:43:08.866
A shave.

407
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:12.536
And a bath.

408
00:43:18.876 --> 00:43:20.586
That's me.

409
00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:27.092
But, Jones, this animal said he was
going to roll me down Main Street!

410
00:43:27.635 --> 00:43:31.889
Down Main Street, right out
of town, one kick at a time!

411
00:43:33.307 --> 00:43:35.309
Squeeze.

412
00:43:36.101 --> 00:43:38.646
With spurs on, Jones!

413
00:44:22.189 --> 00:44:24.400
I need a ride.

414
00:44:26.277 --> 00:44:29.238
-You didn't have to do this.-That's okay.

415
00:44:29.446 --> 00:44:32.199
I've been meaning to buy some records.

416
00:44:32.741 --> 00:44:35.202
We don't sell records.

417
00:44:36.161 --> 00:44:38.247
I thought you said it was a record store.

418
00:44:38.372 --> 00:44:42.459
It's just called a record
store. It�s all CDs.

419
00:44:42.668 --> 00:44:47.172
Right. Well, I don�t have
a record player anyway.

420
00:45:08.068 --> 00:45:10.571
I don't care if you don�t
like the picture, okay?

421
00:45:10.779 --> 00:45:13.160
-What picture?-It's not
going to hurt my feelings.

422
00:45:13.282 --> 00:45:16.140
You could've at least acknowledged
the damn thing, you know.

423
00:45:17.411 --> 00:45:20.748
-What picture?-The picture I gave you.

424
00:45:20.873 --> 00:45:25.669
The picture I slipped under your
door! I put it in an envelope and...

425
00:45:25.794 --> 00:45:31.717
Look, there's no way you didn't... Oh,
goddamn it. She likes you, right?

426
00:45:31.842 --> 00:45:35.429
-Who?-Who? The bitch that...

427
00:45:36.513 --> 00:45:40.142
Just forget it, forget it. I�m sorry.

428
00:45:42.353 --> 00:45:48.692
-Are you coming in?-No. I
don't have a CD player either.

429
00:45:49.026 --> 00:45:53.489
-Will you need a ride
home?-No. I'll manage.

430
00:45:55.074 --> 00:45:56.992
How about you?

431
00:46:13.801 --> 00:46:16.220
Okay, shut it off.

432
00:46:17.471 --> 00:46:21.141
That's great. How do
you know all this stuff?

433
00:46:21.266 --> 00:46:24.728
-I learned it from Rocky.-Who's Rocky?

434
00:46:24.895 --> 00:46:28.190
-That motorcycle in my apartment?-Yeah?

435
00:46:28.399 --> 00:46:30.109
That's Rocky.

436
00:46:32.069 --> 00:46:35.948
He left that behind, the rogue.

437
00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:38.033
He was my last.

438
00:46:38.409 --> 00:46:42.579
He lived in your apartment for a while,
but he spent most of his time in mine.

439
00:46:42.746 --> 00:46:44.665
Then he moved on.

440
00:46:45.499 --> 00:46:47.751
That was three years ago.

441
00:46:49.878 --> 00:46:52.756
-Jones?-Yeah?

442
00:46:53.215 --> 00:46:56.844
It's been three years
since I had sex, Jones.

443
00:46:58.804 --> 00:47:03.642
Didn't you say ""? Three
years and you say ""?

444
00:47:03.767 --> 00:47:08.439
Listen, you, three years of
celibacy deserves more than ""

445
00:47:08.647 --> 00:47:12.818
"" doesn't come close.-Try 17.

446
00:47:13.026 --> 00:47:17.531
-What, years?-Well, the
first 12 were pretty easy.

447
00:47:17.698 --> 00:47:19.491
But what about...?

448
00:47:20.409 --> 00:47:22.619
So you're a...?

449
00:47:39.636 --> 00:47:41.305
It's great.

450
00:47:42.264 --> 00:47:44.391
It's really great.

451
00:47:44.558 --> 00:47:46.477
It's the pain.

452
00:47:46.643 --> 00:47:48.187
The pain?

453
00:47:49.271 --> 00:47:54.151
That's why I like it. Because
it's honest and it's real...

454
00:47:54.276 --> 00:47:57.279
and it's nothing you can faker hide.

455
00:47:58.405 --> 00:48:01.867
To me, it's like you're feeling
pain for the first time in your life.

456
00:48:02.326 --> 00:48:05.871
And before this moment,
you didn't even know it existed.

457
00:48:06.789 --> 00:48:11.752
I broke my arm once when I was a kid.

458
00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:20.093
How is it someone you've just
met, a person you hardly know...

459
00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.763
can somehow know you?
Can take one look at you...

460
00:48:22.971 --> 00:48:26.266
and see more in that instant
than most people will ever see?

461
00:48:26.475 --> 00:48:29.728
I suppose there's only one way to find out.

462
00:48:36.735 --> 00:48:38.862
-Hi, Jane.-Hi.

463
00:48:39.112 --> 00:48:43.242
Hi. I was wondering if
you would, you know...

464
00:48:43.408 --> 00:48:48.539
if you'd like to go out or...?-You're
a little young for me, Jones.

465
00:48:48.747 --> 00:48:52.125
-Besides, I don't date.-Well,
it wouldn't be a date.

466
00:48:52.292 --> 00:48:55.198
I don't know many people here,
and I thought maybe we could...

467
00:48:55.254 --> 00:48:57.297
Maybe you should get a record player.

468
00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:00.133
Well, we don't have to.

469
00:49:03.303 --> 00:49:05.180
I don't do movies.

470
00:49:05.389 --> 00:49:08.559
No dinners, no picnics...

471
00:49:08.767 --> 00:49:10.394
no walks.

472
00:49:11.061 --> 00:49:13.021
How about you decide?

473
00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:20.028
I hear you typing a lot.
What are you writing?

474
00:49:20.195 --> 00:49:23.365
-Letters, mostly.-Letters
to whom, your girlfriend?

475
00:49:25.158 --> 00:49:26.785
Girlfriends.

476
00:49:26.869 --> 00:49:28.829
There are several.

477
00:49:29.162 --> 00:49:30.914
Is that right?

478
00:49:32.833 --> 00:49:35.168
Get the fuck out of here.

479
00:49:45.596 --> 00:49:47.055
Superfecta is the big one.

480
00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:51.101
The first four horses in order
area bitch to win, but top-dollar pay.

481
00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:54.646
Trifecta is the same deal,
but first three horses in order.

482
00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:56.815
Still's a bitch, still good money.

483
00:49:57.316 --> 00:49:59.526
Exacta bet is firsthand second in order.

484
00:49:59.651 --> 00:50:02.237
Quinella is the same, but in any order.

485
00:50:02.321 --> 00:50:04.531
So those are good.
Win, place or show bets...

486
00:50:04.656 --> 00:50:06.408
you can figure out for yourself.

487
00:50:06.575 --> 00:50:08.535
Are you talking to me?

488
00:50:08.744 --> 00:50:10.787
Yes, dummy. How do you want to bet?

489
00:50:10.913 --> 00:50:16.084
I have no idea. How about you
bettor me, and I'll get us some drinks?

490
00:50:16.335 --> 00:50:18.128
Sure you will.

491
00:50:48.992 --> 00:50:51.995
-How did you do that?-A
trick I learned from my mother.

492
00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:55.499
So, what are we drinking to?

493
00:50:57.209 --> 00:50:59.336
Close your eyes and point.

494
00:51:04.216 --> 00:51:06.635
-New in Town.-New in Town.

495
00:51:06.802 --> 00:51:09.554
Yes! New in Town, run, run, run!

496
00:51:09.763 --> 00:51:12.015
Baby, run!

497
00:51:14.977 --> 00:51:16.103
Shit!

498
00:51:18.397 --> 00:51:21.233
-Yes! Go, go!-Go, go, go!

499
00:51:25.153 --> 00:51:28.073
-Yes! Yes! Come on, come
on!-Yes! Yes! Come on!

500
00:51:52.681 --> 00:51:55.017
-Little Bee!-Little Bee! Go on!

501
00:51:56.935 --> 00:51:58.478
-Go, go, go!-Little Bee, run!

502
00:52:19.958 --> 00:52:22.711
I used to go there a lot with Steve...

503
00:52:23.295 --> 00:52:27.466
and he always lost his ass. I guess
that�s why I can still stand it there.

504
00:52:30.177 --> 00:52:32.637
This is the part where
you ask me who Steve is.

505
00:52:33.555 --> 00:52:35.265
No, it isn't.

506
00:52:36.767 --> 00:52:38.477
Fair enough.

507
00:52:39.561 --> 00:52:41.772
Then I'll ask you something.

508
00:52:42.064 --> 00:52:44.983
-Name?-Jones Dillon.

509
00:52:45.525 --> 00:52:48.236
-Age?-Seventeen.

510
00:52:48.612 --> 00:52:50.655
-From?-Texas.

511
00:52:52.157 --> 00:52:55.827
-No funny accent.-I grew
up in the East, mostly.

512
00:52:57.204 --> 00:52:58.663
Me too.

513
00:52:59.915 --> 00:53:02.000
Boarding schools and summer camps.

514
00:53:02.209 --> 00:53:04.336
What about your parents?

515
00:53:04.711 --> 00:53:05.962
What parents?

516
00:53:06.546 --> 00:53:08.924
How many orphans got boarding schools?

517
00:53:09.132 --> 00:53:11.635
Lots. Who's Steve?

518
00:53:13.136 --> 00:53:15.180
I thought you didn't want to know.

519
00:53:15.597 --> 00:53:17.808
He's your old boyfriend?

520
00:53:18.642 --> 00:53:20.143
One of several.

521
00:53:20.310 --> 00:53:22.479
Are you telling me you're an orphan?

522
00:53:22.938 --> 00:53:26.483
Not exactly. How many is several?

523
00:53:26.608 --> 00:53:30.278
-Wouldn't you like to know?-I
just want to know about one.

524
00:53:32.864 --> 00:53:35.617
-That's it. Out of film.-That's it?

525
00:53:35.867 --> 00:53:38.411
Why? You thought you
were getting somewhere?

526
00:53:44.876 --> 00:53:47.671
So is there anything else
should know about you?

527
00:53:47.838 --> 00:53:49.714
I don't think so.

528
00:53:50.382 --> 00:53:53.218
-Unless...-What?

529
00:53:54.261 --> 00:53:55.804
No.

530
00:53:56.263 --> 00:53:57.931
Spill it.

531
00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:03.395
I'm a virgin.

532
00:54:05.522 --> 00:54:06.690
Never?

533
00:54:08.733 --> 00:54:11.194
All those girlfriends and no action?

534
00:54:12.445 --> 00:54:14.698
I almost did once.

535
00:54:14.823 --> 00:54:16.408
Really, when?

536
00:54:16.825 --> 00:54:18.535
Recently.

537
00:54:18.952 --> 00:54:22.247
-How recently?-Pretty recently.

538
00:54:26.084 --> 00:54:27.836
I want to tell you something.

539
00:54:28.003 --> 00:54:31.756
If you want to hang out with
her, you don't hang out here, okay?

540
00:54:33.383 --> 00:54:35.385
I'll hang out here.

541
00:54:38.597 --> 00:54:40.098
Okay.

542
00:54:48.106 --> 00:54:49.608
Jane?

543
00:54:50.066 --> 00:54:52.652
-Yeah?-I'm sorry.

544
00:54:55.113 --> 00:54:57.115
I'm sorry about the kiss.

545
00:55:17.552 --> 00:55:19.804
So, what do you know about Jane and Steve?

546
00:55:19.971 --> 00:55:21.765
Can't do it. Sorry.

547
00:55:21.973 --> 00:55:23.975
-Can't do what?-Can't say.

548
00:55:24.726 --> 00:55:27.854
It's one of those upstairs
stories, partner. Sorry.

549
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:30.398
-But you know?-Can't say.

550
00:55:30.565 --> 00:55:32.442
But there's something to know, right?

551
00:55:33.151 --> 00:55:34.402
Is there?

552
00:55:35.487 --> 00:55:37.072
Damn.

553
00:56:19.447 --> 00:56:21.032
Partner.

554
00:56:21.741 --> 00:56:23.535
She's at your door.

555
00:56:32.419 --> 00:56:33.962
Hi!

556
00:56:34.713 --> 00:56:37.882
-I didn't think you were
home.-I'm not. I wasn't.

557
00:56:38.049 --> 00:56:40.510
But I am now. Now I am.

558
00:56:41.052 --> 00:56:43.138
Want to go for a ride?

559
00:56:44.472 --> 00:56:46.433
In a half an hour?

560
00:56:50.103 --> 00:56:51.438
Blanche is in Texas.

561
00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:54.482
-Who?-Blanche, my mother.

562
00:56:55.191 --> 00:56:57.777
You asked me about my parents.

563
00:56:57.986 --> 00:57:02.907
She lives alone. Drinks. Dates
mostly men from the country club.

564
00:57:03.033 --> 00:57:06.828
She ran my father off when I was 3. Or 4.

565
00:57:06.995 --> 00:57:09.372
Her story always changes.

566
00:57:12.792 --> 00:57:13.793
What?

567
00:57:14.002 --> 00:57:16.629
This is the part where
you tell me about Steve.

568
00:57:16.921 --> 00:57:18.298
Is that right?

569
00:57:18.965 --> 00:57:21.301
I used to working this shitty little bar.

570
00:57:21.468 --> 00:57:23.219
Steve came with his band, like...

571
00:57:23.386 --> 00:57:26.389
they were playing a
stadium shower something.

572
00:57:26.639 --> 00:57:29.559
And for the next three nights,
he sang every song for me.

573
00:57:30.185 --> 00:57:32.020
I had never met anybody like him.

574
00:57:32.187 --> 00:57:35.106
He said all the right things,
did all the right things.

575
00:57:35.273 --> 00:57:38.985
Everything was so right.

576
00:57:39.152 --> 00:57:42.405
Then he fucked it all up. Me especially.

577
00:57:42.572 --> 00:57:44.282
You seem okay to me.

578
00:57:45.283 --> 00:57:47.702
I used to be better than okay.

579
00:57:48.078 --> 00:57:50.497
Oh, shit! Fuck!

580
00:58:29.828 --> 00:58:31.246
New in Town.

581
00:58:31.454 --> 00:58:33.164
How are you?

582
00:58:33.790 --> 00:58:35.542
How do I look?

583
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:37.502
You look great.

584
00:58:38.378 --> 00:58:40.338
How's your arm?

585
00:58:40.588 --> 00:58:42.757
I'll pull through, I think.

586
00:58:42.924 --> 00:58:44.801
Thank God.

587
00:58:45.677 --> 00:58:47.846
I'm miserable, Jones.

588
00:58:48.054 --> 00:58:49.722
That must hurt pretty badly.

589
00:58:49.889 --> 00:58:52.058
No. I'm so bored.

590
00:58:52.225 --> 00:58:54.936
Right. Maybe you
should get a record player.

591
00:58:55.687 --> 00:58:57.230
Shut up.

592
00:58:58.731 --> 00:59:00.483
You know what I want?

593
00:59:00.733 --> 00:59:02.777
I want you to write me a letter.

594
00:59:03.027 --> 00:59:04.195
A letter?

595
00:59:04.362 --> 00:59:07.198
Yeah, like the ones you
write to your girlfriends.

596
00:59:07.365 --> 00:59:10.076
But just a "letter"
letter, not a love letter.

597
00:59:10.452 --> 00:59:13.079
I don't have any girlfriends.

598
00:59:13.246 --> 00:59:16.458
-I write them to someone
else.-Well, I'm someone else.

599
00:59:16.666 --> 00:59:21.713
-Write one to me.-No, I
mean... I don't send them.

600
00:59:22.464 --> 00:59:23.756
It's complicated.

601
00:59:23.923 --> 00:59:27.093
Jones, I'm in the hospital, for Chris sake.

602
00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:30.346
I think I deserve at least a letter.

603
00:59:31.973 --> 00:59:35.101
I knew that something like
this was going to happen to you.

604
00:59:35.477 --> 00:59:39.147
No, Blanche, really, I'm fine.
I�m going to pull through.

605
00:59:39.314 --> 00:59:41.733
You see, Jones, this is what happens.

606
00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:43.804
I tell you things, and you don't listen.

607
00:59:43.985 --> 00:59:45.778
You don't ever listen to me, do you?

608
00:59:45.987 --> 00:59:48.321
Well, you don't ever tell
me what I want to hear.

609
00:59:48.948 --> 00:59:53.953
Don't you start. This is about
you, Jones. This is about reality.

610
00:59:54.078 --> 00:59:56.748
I'm going to have to hang
up. I�ve got breakfast coming.

611
00:59:56.915 --> 00:59:59.751
There's a place that delivers
bagels and belly dancers.

612
00:59:59.918 --> 01:00:02.295
-It's fantastic.-Are you drunk, Jones?

613
01:00:02.504 --> 01:00:04.255
What are you talking about?

614
01:00:04.422 --> 01:00:07.091
-Here she is.-Jones?

615
01:00:09.302 --> 01:00:11.679
You can set that down anywhere.

616
01:01:21.583 --> 01:01:23.793
-How did he find out?-I called him.

617
01:01:24.877 --> 01:01:26.796
You were bored, so you called.

618
01:01:26.963 --> 01:01:31.217
Wrong. I missed him, and I
wanted to call him, so I did.

619
01:01:31.384 --> 01:01:33.553
Didn't he fuck you up or something?

620
01:01:34.095 --> 01:01:36.306
What's your problem, Jones?

621
01:01:37.515 --> 01:01:39.309
I thought we were friends.

622
01:01:40.977 --> 01:01:43.605
He came 2000 miles, Jones.

623
01:01:43.771 --> 01:01:46.816
She can't help herself, Jones.
It�s a biological weakness...

624
01:01:46.983 --> 01:01:50.653
for the
black-leather/guitar-player type.

625
01:01:51.070 --> 01:01:53.906
I've experienced bouts of it myself.

626
01:01:54.073 --> 01:01:56.159
It's powerful stuff.

627
01:01:56.326 --> 01:01:59.787
Well, it's good. Really.

628
01:02:00.455 --> 01:02:01.956
I'm happy for her.

629
01:02:02.123 --> 01:02:05.335
She seems happy too, which is good.

630
01:02:05.793 --> 01:02:07.337
It's great.

631
01:02:07.712 --> 01:02:10.048
Grab your hammer, partner.

632
01:02:37.992 --> 01:02:40.161
-Hi, Jones.-Hi, Lisa.

633
01:02:40.286 --> 01:02:42.747
Did you see Jane's car?

634
01:02:45.083 --> 01:02:47.418
What happened to your arm?

635
01:02:49.796 --> 01:02:51.631
You were with her.

636
01:02:52.090 --> 01:02:54.384
Well, I'm glad you're okay.

637
01:02:59.389 --> 01:03:00.765
What about Jane?

638
01:03:02.725 --> 01:03:05.144
-She's okay.-I'm glad.

639
01:03:05.311 --> 01:03:07.772
You know, when
something like this happens...

640
01:03:07.939 --> 01:03:11.651
it kind of makes me wonder
if I should tell her I'm sorry.

641
01:03:12.026 --> 01:03:15.279
Well, it was the deer's fault, mostly.

642
01:03:25.206 --> 01:03:27.166
Is that for me?

643
01:03:31.629 --> 01:03:33.923
I write them to my father.

644
01:03:34.924 --> 01:03:37.969
I don't send them, because
don't know his address.

645
01:03:38.386 --> 01:03:42.473
Because I don't know if he's
alive or dead or anything else.

646
01:03:42.682 --> 01:03:44.225
Nothing.

647
01:03:47.478 --> 01:03:49.105
Only you.

648
01:03:50.982 --> 01:03:52.483
Okay.

649
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:54.736
Say it.

650
01:03:56.362 --> 01:03:58.114
Only me.

651
01:04:10.168 --> 01:04:11.502
Jones?

652
01:04:14.088 --> 01:04:15.757
I'll be leaving soon.

653
01:04:17.341 --> 01:04:18.801
I know.

654
01:04:19.135 --> 01:04:21.888
I don't mean just from the hospital.

655
01:04:23.473 --> 01:04:25.057
I know.

656
01:04:35.318 --> 01:04:38.196
-Hey, guy.-Hey, Steve.

657
01:04:40.156 --> 01:04:42.700
Oh, the famous copilot.

658
01:04:42.867 --> 01:04:44.410
-Jones, right?-Right.

659
01:04:44.577 --> 01:04:46.913
Yeah. How's the arm?

660
01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:51.542
You fucked her, didn't you?

661
01:04:51.834 --> 01:04:54.212
-What?-Lisa.

662
01:04:55.963 --> 01:04:57.632
Oh, yeah.

663
01:04:57.799 --> 01:04:59.300
You?

664
01:05:00.968 --> 01:05:02.470
But it was nothing.

665
01:05:02.637 --> 01:05:04.806
-Nothing?-Yeah.

666
01:05:05.014 --> 01:05:06.516
Jane took pictures of her.

667
01:05:06.682 --> 01:05:09.477
Sexy stuff, where she was
wrapped in these scarves...

668
01:05:09.644 --> 01:05:12.104
and I wanted to find
out what was under there.

669
01:05:12.271 --> 01:05:13.981
But...

670
01:05:14.565 --> 01:05:17.777
it was nothing. And I
mean, Jane took it pretty hard.

671
01:05:17.944 --> 01:05:21.072
I mean, Jane takes everything pretty hard.

672
01:05:26.911 --> 01:05:28.871
What am I telling you for?

673
01:05:29.038 --> 01:05:31.249
You don't even have a CD player.

674
01:05:37.839 --> 01:05:39.131
Dear Dad:

675
01:05:39.298 --> 01:05:42.051
You'll be glad to know I'm
recovering from the accident.

676
01:05:42.218 --> 01:05:43.928
And that girl I told you about?

677
01:05:44.053 --> 01:05:45.847
She's as good as new.

678
01:05:46.264 --> 01:05:50.852
What I can't figure out is, how
could I have been so stupid?

679
01:06:15.585 --> 01:06:17.169
How?

680
01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.547
You're listed.

681
01:06:19.714 --> 01:06:25.094
That Brad person downstairs,
he told me which apartment, so...

682
01:06:25.845 --> 01:06:27.471
That Brad person?

683
01:06:27.638 --> 01:06:31.893
Yeah. Do you know he made a
pass at me? Wouldn't you know it?

684
01:06:32.518 --> 01:06:35.771
-You look nice, Blanche.-Well...

685
01:06:37.148 --> 01:06:39.275
then ask me to sit down.

686
01:06:43.446 --> 01:06:47.950
Well, thank you, Mr. Sophisticated.

687
01:06:52.872 --> 01:06:54.874
I got a motorcycle.

688
01:06:55.166 --> 01:06:57.585
Well, isn't that nice.

689
01:06:57.752 --> 01:06:59.962
Maybe I should throw
myself off this roof...

690
01:07:00.129 --> 01:07:02.882
save the trouble of having to bury you.

691
01:07:03.049 --> 01:07:06.302
I don't think the fall would
kill you, but you could try it.

692
01:07:06.969 --> 01:07:09.138
Tell me about this Jane person.

693
01:07:09.305 --> 01:07:12.600
Skip the part about her
being lousy driver, though.

694
01:07:12.808 --> 01:07:14.518
I don't know.

695
01:07:16.187 --> 01:07:19.092
-She's a lot like you,
actually.-That's exactly what happens.

696
01:07:19.231 --> 01:07:23.819
Boys always chase after girls
that remind them of their mothers.

697
01:07:23.986 --> 01:07:26.405
She drinks, she's rude, and she�s loud...

698
01:07:26.572 --> 01:07:29.325
Yeah, okay. Shut up, will you?

699
01:07:30.534 --> 01:07:32.078
Is she pretty?

700
01:07:33.287 --> 01:07:34.914
She's beautiful.

701
01:07:41.879 --> 01:07:43.255
What about you, Blanche?

702
01:07:43.422 --> 01:07:46.676
Are you making anyone
miserable on a regular basis?

703
01:07:47.134 --> 01:07:50.638
If that's your cute way of asking
if I'm in love with anybody...

704
01:07:50.846 --> 01:07:53.224
the answer is no.

705
01:07:53.724 --> 01:07:55.142
Come on, Blanche.

706
01:07:55.309 --> 01:07:59.397
Well, sure, there might be
times when I'm sweet on a man.

707
01:07:59.563 --> 01:08:02.858
I like to feel good as
mochas the next girl.

708
01:08:03.025 --> 01:08:07.697
But don't confuse feeling
good with being in love, Jones.

709
01:08:07.863 --> 01:08:11.492
No, those two roads, they rarely cross.

710
01:08:11.617 --> 01:08:14.203
Rarely or never?

711
01:08:17.373 --> 01:08:21.877
Why are you still dragging
around that beat-up trunk?

712
01:08:22.294 --> 01:08:26.173
That's all I have. That and his typewriter.

713
01:08:28.342 --> 01:08:32.930
Well, why don't you see if you�ve
got a blanket in there for me.

714
01:08:34.682 --> 01:08:36.559
I guess it's getting late.

715
01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:39.854
We'll talk tomorrow.

716
01:08:40.354 --> 01:08:41.939
Okay.

717
01:08:42.898 --> 01:08:44.442
Tomorrow.

718
01:11:26.896 --> 01:11:28.772
Jones, watch the road!

719
01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:35.029
It's beautiful. You guys are unbelievable.

720
01:11:35.196 --> 01:11:37.448
Well, all I did was beat on it.

721
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:42.995
How would you like to drive it?

722
01:11:43.913 --> 01:11:47.208
Around the block, or 2000 miles one-way?

723
01:11:50.544 --> 01:11:52.087
Okay.

724
01:11:54.048 --> 01:11:55.591
I'll do it.

725
01:11:57.092 --> 01:11:58.969
Why would you do it?

726
01:11:59.136 --> 01:12:00.888
We're friends, right?

727
01:12:02.264 --> 01:12:04.308
Yeah, we're friends.

728
01:12:31.335 --> 01:12:34.880
Poor guy. He's crying.

729
01:12:35.005 --> 01:12:39.677
Crying. I'll only be gone
for a couple of days.

730
01:12:42.012 --> 01:12:45.933
-Shut up, Jones, and drive.-Right.

731
01:13:05.452 --> 01:13:07.305
"I'm sorry, Jones. I
don't have any answers."

732
01:13:07.329 --> 01:13:08.598
"I'm sorry, Jones. I
don't have any answers."

733
01:13:08.622 --> 01:13:12.793
Not many anyway, and probably
none that would make you very happy.

734
01:13:14.795 --> 01:13:17.256
No one ever looked at
menthe way your father did.

735
01:13:17.423 --> 01:13:20.050
"He didn't see a pretty
girl with a rich daddy."

736
01:13:20.634 --> 01:13:24.847
He saw someone with
hopes and dreams of her own.

737
01:13:25.014 --> 01:13:27.474
And I would have followed him anywhere.

738
01:13:27.683 --> 01:13:31.854
Well, we only got as far as a
little cabin in a motor court.

739
01:13:31.979 --> 01:13:37.443
I made eggs and toast in the
kitchen, and we laughed, made love...

740
01:13:37.609 --> 01:13:38.986
and drank whiskey.

741
01:13:39.153 --> 01:13:44.033
I wasn't more than 50 miles
from home, but it felt like 5000.

742
01:13:44.199 --> 01:13:49.955
And those two little rooms, they
felt like the whole wide world to me.

743
01:13:50.122 --> 01:13:55.544
But for him, I think it was just
another dot on another map.

744
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:57.963
I'm sorry, Jones.

745
01:13:58.130 --> 01:14:02.343
I know I told you a lot of
pretty things about your father...

746
01:14:02.509 --> 01:14:04.803
things I wanted to believe too.

747
01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:08.891
But the truth is, you never met your daddy.

748
01:14:09.058 --> 01:14:13.270
One day he went out for
cigarettes, and he never came back.

749
01:14:23.322 --> 01:14:25.199
These letters of yours are hilarious.

750
01:14:25.407 --> 01:14:27.868
I wish you'd let me show this one to Steve.

751
01:14:28.077 --> 01:14:31.622
Where I'm tied up in the trunk
and you come to my rescue.

752
01:14:32.915 --> 01:14:34.249
I know what he did.

753
01:14:35.751 --> 01:14:38.003
-What who did?-Steve.

754
01:14:38.170 --> 01:14:39.671
I know what he did.

755
01:14:51.558 --> 01:14:53.060
Jesus!

756
01:14:53.227 --> 01:14:55.104
Trying to get me drunk?

757
01:15:04.947 --> 01:15:07.574
I tried to pretend it didn't happen...

758
01:15:07.741 --> 01:15:12.162
that I didn't know, that
I couldn't see it in his face.

759
01:15:12.496 --> 01:15:15.332
But why? Why pretend?

760
01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:20.462
Because I didn't want to go
back to the way it was before.

761
01:15:21.338 --> 01:15:25.968
With Steve, there's no
yesterday, no tomorrow, just now.

762
01:15:26.176 --> 01:15:28.595
Always and forever now.

763
01:15:29.221 --> 01:15:33.183
For the first time in my life, I
knew what it felt like to be free.

764
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:35.269
Let me try.

765
01:15:35.686 --> 01:15:38.355
I could do it, Jane. I could rescue you.

766
01:15:38.522 --> 01:15:40.023
You are so nice.

767
01:15:40.441 --> 01:15:43.235
I could fuck Lisa if nice
is a problem for you.

768
01:15:47.364 --> 01:15:50.951
We're too much alike. I could
see it in the photos I took.

769
01:15:52.953 --> 01:15:54.913
I can see it now.

770
01:16:05.841 --> 01:16:09.511
-Are you afraid of the
dark?-I thought you'd want it.

771
01:16:09.928 --> 01:16:12.097
You can switch it off.

772
01:16:52.930 --> 01:16:54.556
Jones...

773
01:16:55.265 --> 01:16:57.684
this is not happening.

774
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:01.897
Say it.

775
01:17:02.731 --> 01:17:04.858
This is not happening.

776
01:18:22.311 --> 01:18:26.273
You know, I've been some places.

777
01:18:26.732 --> 01:18:29.943
Texas. Delaware.

778
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:32.446
Three schools in New Hampshire.

779
01:18:32.696 --> 01:18:34.323
Kansas.

780
01:18:34.656 --> 01:18:37.409
Not everywhere, so maybe I'm wrong.

781
01:18:38.619 --> 01:18:42.039
But I think you're probably the
most beautiful woman in the world.

782
01:18:43.123 --> 01:18:45.125
What did you say?

783
01:18:46.084 --> 01:18:47.628
Nothing.

784
01:18:50.505 --> 01:18:52.215
You said something.

785
01:18:54.301 --> 01:18:56.261
I said, we're here.

786
01:19:09.399 --> 01:19:13.570
Hey, guy! I can't believe this
piece of crap actually made it.

787
01:19:21.745 --> 01:19:24.498
-You can't do this.-Don't.

788
01:19:24.706 --> 01:19:26.249
What's that?

789
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:28.126
That stays.

790
01:19:29.544 --> 01:19:32.964
Oh, right, the top-secret
funny stuff. What was I thinking?

791
01:19:34.132 --> 01:19:37.344
-Last night did happen.-Please, Jones.

792
01:19:37.511 --> 01:19:40.472
-What happened last night?-Nothing.

793
01:19:40.639 --> 01:19:43.892
-Nothing happened last night.-Yes,
it did, and it wasn't nothing.

794
01:19:44.059 --> 01:19:45.936
-It was something.-Stop it.

795
01:19:46.103 --> 01:19:47.813
-This something I should know?-No.

796
01:19:47.979 --> 01:19:51.024
Yes, it is.

797
01:19:51.692 --> 01:19:53.652
In your dreams, kid.

798
01:19:55.737 --> 01:19:57.698
What are you doing, Jones?

799
01:19:59.157 --> 01:20:01.660
Steve, stop it!

800
01:20:02.744 --> 01:20:04.287
Stop it!

801
01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:08.500
Get in the car, Jones.
I want to talk to you.

802
01:20:14.423 --> 01:20:17.092
-Why did you do that?-Jane,
what are you doing?

803
01:20:17.259 --> 01:20:20.262
-Come on, open up!-You're
better than this, Jane.

804
01:20:20.429 --> 01:20:22.305
-You're better than okay.-Come on...

805
01:20:22.472 --> 01:20:23.849
-Give me a minute.-Jane!

806
01:20:23.974 --> 01:20:25.934
Give me a minute!

807
01:20:26.184 --> 01:20:27.728
Last night was now, wasn't it?

808
01:20:27.894 --> 01:20:31.064
There was no yesterday, no
tomorrow, and it still is now.

809
01:20:31.231 --> 01:20:34.735
-It's not too late.-Jones, it is tomorrow.

810
01:20:34.901 --> 01:20:37.237
I'm here. I cannot go back.

811
01:20:41.783 --> 01:20:43.535
Does it hurt?

812
01:20:46.621 --> 01:20:49.249
I want you to take the car.

813
01:20:49.624 --> 01:20:52.294
-I don't want the car.-Take it anyways.

814
01:20:52.502 --> 01:20:55.046
You fixed her. You put her back together.

815
01:21:31.625 --> 01:21:33.919
-Oh, shit!-Somebody called the cops!

816
01:21:34.127 --> 01:21:38.006
-Let's get the hell out of
here.-Yeah, let's go, man!

817
01:21:38.924 --> 01:21:41.384
Piece-of-shit car!

818
01:21:41.551 --> 01:21:43.720
Let's go. Let's go!

819
01:21:51.102 --> 01:21:54.773
-Hello.-It was me, wasn't it, Blanche?

820
01:21:55.982 --> 01:21:59.236
-Jones?-All these years, I blamed you.

821
01:21:59.361 --> 01:22:00.821
I thought it was your fault.

822
01:22:00.987 --> 01:22:03.323
But it was me, always me.

823
01:22:03.490 --> 01:22:05.158
Jones, where are you?

824
01:22:05.325 --> 01:22:09.120
Why didn't you tell me the truth?
He left because you got pregnant.

825
01:22:09.246 --> 01:22:10.914
Because...

826
01:22:13.375 --> 01:22:15.418
Oh, honey.

827
01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:20.882
Because I didn't want
you to feel the way I did.

828
01:22:21.174 --> 01:22:24.177
I thought I could at least do that for you.

829
01:22:24.386 --> 01:22:27.556
What, so you could send me
away to school? And every summer.

830
01:22:27.722 --> 01:22:31.017
No, that was your granddaddy's doing.

831
01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:35.647
He said that I'd never make
for any kind of a mother...

832
01:22:35.772 --> 01:22:37.858
and I should just take care of it.

833
01:22:38.483 --> 01:22:40.569
You were my chance, Jones.

834
01:22:40.735 --> 01:22:42.571
That he might come back.

835
01:22:42.696 --> 01:22:44.614
I was your chance that he'd come back.

836
01:22:44.781 --> 01:22:47.617
No. I knew he wasn't coming back.

837
01:22:47.784 --> 01:22:51.079
You can't stop some people, Jones.

838
01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:55.292
They come into your
life destined to leave it.

839
01:22:56.042 --> 01:22:58.587
You can wrap your arms tight around them.

840
01:22:58.753 --> 01:23:03.216
The best that you can hope to
do is just slow them down a little...

841
01:23:03.341 --> 01:23:07.137
because there's no
holding on tight enough.

842
01:23:09.806 --> 01:23:11.141
But you were mine.

843
01:23:11.850 --> 01:23:14.603
You were my chance, and I blew it.

844
01:23:14.769 --> 01:23:16.521
Blanche...

845
01:23:17.314 --> 01:23:19.024
no.

846
01:23:20.317 --> 01:23:21.985
You didn't blow it, Blanche.

847
01:23:57.395 --> 01:23:59.230
Jones!

848
01:23:59.397 --> 01:24:02.233
-Guess what.-You're moving out.

849
01:24:02.817 --> 01:24:04.778
Guess why I'm moving out.

850
01:24:05.487 --> 01:24:07.822
-You got a part.-Yes!

851
01:24:08.823 --> 01:24:12.327
It's a musical on a cruise ship,
so my stuff is going into storage...

852
01:24:12.535 --> 01:24:14.371
and I'm going to sea.

853
01:24:14.746 --> 01:24:17.207
-What happened to
your eye?-Oh, it's nothing.

854
01:24:17.374 --> 01:24:19.709
Congratulations, Lisa.

855
01:24:20.001 --> 01:24:21.836
I left you something.

856
01:24:26.758 --> 01:24:28.802
It's going to be worth something someday.

857
01:24:28.969 --> 01:24:31.429
You want me to autograph it for you?

858
01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:34.432
I'll just hold on to it.

859
01:26:07.233 --> 01:26:09.861
Hi. Oh, brother, where you been?

860
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:12.155
Here, hit this, man. Check it out.

861
01:26:13.281 --> 01:26:14.699
Hey!

862
01:26:14.866 --> 01:26:16.659
Hey, what the fuck?

863
01:26:17.035 --> 01:26:18.495
Hey!

864
01:26:18.828 --> 01:26:21.998
What are you doing? What are you doing?

865
01:26:24.417 --> 01:26:26.044
What are you doing?

866
01:26:29.506 --> 01:26:31.633
No talk, no rock, no rap, no crap.

867
01:26:31.841 --> 01:26:36.137
Nothing but today's best
country, 24 hours a day.

868
01:26:47.148 --> 01:26:48.775
Hey, you.

869
01:26:49.067 --> 01:26:52.070
Wait a minute. I know
you. What did I tell you, kid?

870
01:26:52.278 --> 01:26:54.517
-What did I tell you?-I
think you dropped this.

871
01:26:55.031 --> 01:26:57.325
-Oh, my God.-Shit!

872
01:26:57.450 --> 01:26:59.744
Shit! This is a new shirt!

873
01:27:00.495 --> 01:27:02.705
This is a new shirt.

874
01:27:02.872 --> 01:27:05.125
Shit. Shit!

875
01:27:08.128 --> 01:27:10.672
Don't ever change that hair, okay?

876
01:28:17.113 --> 01:28:19.866
What the hell did you do to my car?

877
01:28:21.618 --> 01:28:24.787
-Sorry about that.-Liar.

878
01:28:29.542 --> 01:28:31.711
What happened to your motorbike?

879
01:28:31.878 --> 01:28:34.005
She just quit on me.

880
01:28:35.048 --> 01:28:37.258
Nothing lasts forever.

881
01:28:38.801 --> 01:28:40.345
Right.

882
01:28:51.898 --> 01:28:55.401
Do you still think I'm the most
beautiful woman in the world?

883
01:28:56.694 --> 01:28:58.988
Shut up and drive.
