Test, test, test.

2
00:01:28.456 --> 00:01:30.358
This is a test.

3
00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:33.627
One, two, test.

4
00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:46.840
Kid.

5
00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:52.646
Are you lost, kid?

6
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.441
Hey.

7
00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:56.176
Where's, uh,
where's your big brother, kid?

8
00:02:56.244 --> 00:02:57.278
I don't have one.

9
00:02:57.345 --> 00:02:58.712
Yeah?

10
00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.014
Don't you look a little too
kiddie-like to be in college?

11
00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:03.116
You still wetting the bed?

12
00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:05.052
Well, congratulations.

13
00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:09.523
Now, here's the deal,
I listen to ska music, right?

14
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.793
Just ska. No rap, no punk,
no hip-hop, no heavy metal,

15
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.863
no classical, no classic rock,
no new wave, no new age,

16
00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:17.831
no bluegrass, no blues, no jazz,

17
00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:19.533
and no fuckin' country.

18
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.270

00:03:22.336 --> 00:03:25.239

Well, thank you.

46
00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:26.494
Now, I don't know, though.

47
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.796
Aren't you a little young
to be renting an apartment?

48
00:05:28.862 --> 00:05:31.098
No. Ma'am.
I'm a legitimate boarder.

49
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.567
What's that there?

50
00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:35.469
Just my things.

51
00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:37.037
I see.

52
00:05:37.104 --> 00:05:40.140
Well, most people I rent to like to
see the place before they take it.

53
00:05:40.741 --> 00:05:41.775
Ok.

54
00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.726
There are two white girls
upstairs with you,

55
00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:01.028
and a white man
has the first floor.

56
00:06:01.094 --> 00:06:04.031
You'll be just fine here,
Jones. Snug like a bug.

57
00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:08.736
Thank you.

58
00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:24.284
What is this?

59
00:06:24.852 --> 00:06:25.986
My rent check.

60
00:06:26.053 --> 00:06:28.155
$12,000?

61
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.891
Well, that was the figure
on the lease.

62
00:06:33.093 --> 00:06:36.897
It's my grandfather's money,
or it was, anyway.

63
00:06:36.964 --> 00:06:40.233
He went to college here and the
will said I had to come here, too.

64
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.869
And I didn't want
to go to Texas.

65
00:06:41.935 --> 00:06:43.504
What's in Texas?

66
00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:44.938
Just my mother.

67
00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:16.904
You'll be glad to know I
dropped out of college today.

68
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.973
You told me yourself,
all a writer needs is his eyes and ears,

69
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.809
and sense enough to use them.

70
00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:25.278
Besides, you know I don't
play well with the other kids.

71
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.882
Better watch your ass, punk!

72
00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:29.950
Yeah, punk!

73
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.489
You know how much
this means to me.

74
00:08:09.557 --> 00:08:10.991
Don't be like this.

75
00:08:11.058 --> 00:08:13.393
Look, I'll be there
in twenty minutes, ok?

76
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.329
Don't be this way.
Ok, I'm fine...

77
00:08:16.396 --> 00:08:18.799
I'll just hang up right now.

78
00:08:18.866 --> 00:08:21.735

89
00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:09.917
Jones. Jones Dillon.

90
00:09:09.983 --> 00:09:12.519
You listen to Ma, now,
'cause she speaks the truth.

91
00:09:12.586 --> 00:09:16.556
There is nothing, absolutely nothing,
as important as a bed.

92
00:09:17.257 --> 00:09:18.258
Nothing?

93
00:09:18.325 --> 00:09:19.326
Nothing!

94
00:09:20.961 --> 00:09:24.331
A happy bed makes for
a happy home, Mr. Jones.

95
00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:25.766
If you take my meaning.

96
00:09:28.869 --> 00:09:30.638
Jones,

97
00:09:30.704 --> 00:09:33.140
hmm, Jones.

98
00:09:33.206 --> 00:09:37.044
I knew a man named Jones once. Yes,
indeed!

99
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.812
Maybe he was your daddy.

100
00:09:40.347 --> 00:09:42.115
I doubt it, ma'am.

101
00:09:42.182 --> 00:09:44.618
Well, I wouldn't be
too sure, now.

102
00:09:44.685 --> 00:09:47.621
He was a handsome devil,
just like you are.

103
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.165
Phone?

104
00:09:58.231 --> 00:10:01.434
I... I don't have one yet.
I'll get one.

105
00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:04.571
Well, you be sure
and let Ma know

106
00:10:04.638 --> 00:10:06.473
just as soon as you do.

107
00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:08.441
Hi, Ma.

108
00:10:08.508 --> 00:10:10.911
Oh, boys,
this is Mr. Jones.

109
00:10:10.978 --> 00:10:14.247
Will you tell him when you all
can deliver him his furniture?

110
00:10:14.314 --> 00:10:15.315
Be a week at least.

111
00:10:15.382 --> 00:10:16.884
Be at least a week, maybe two.

112
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.218
Could be two.

113
00:10:18.285 --> 00:10:20.253
That's ok. Fine.

114
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.521
We ain't askin'.

115
00:10:21.588 --> 00:10:23.290
No one's askin' you nothin'.

116
00:10:23.356 --> 00:10:25.192
Now you boys shut the hell up.

117
00:10:25.258 --> 00:10:27.027
Talkin' to my customers
like that.

118
00:10:27.094 --> 00:10:28.195
Now, get out!

119
00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:29.362
Sorry, Ma.

120
00:10:29.429 --> 00:10:30.430
Go on!

121
00:10:31.832 --> 00:10:32.833
Get!

122
00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:35.035
From my second husband.

123
00:10:58.759 --> 00:11:00.593
Kid, you ain't twenty-one.

124
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.197
Twenty-two. Twenty-three in
December. You can see there.

125
00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:14.641
My mother, she was deep
into all of it,

126
00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:17.244
booze, pills,

127
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.747
everything she could get
her hands on.

128
00:11:19.813 --> 00:11:22.415
I was born ten weeks premature.

129
00:11:22.482 --> 00:11:24.785
By the time the doctors
discovered the bone disease,

130
00:11:24.852 --> 00:11:27.955
it was too late
to treat properly.

131
00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:30.623
I've been suffering
since before I was born.

132
00:11:32.259 --> 00:11:33.260
Damn.

133
00:11:34.594 --> 00:11:35.963
You need anything else?

134
00:11:38.498 --> 00:11:39.566
Pack of cigarettes.

135
00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:42.235
Yeah, just be a second.
Anything else?

136
00:11:44.004 --> 00:11:45.405
Pack of cigarettes.

137
00:12:08.962 --> 00:12:10.397
Scheißauto!

138
00:12:38.125 --> 00:12:39.126

140
00:12:43.563 --> 00:12:44.764

141
00:12:45.532 --> 00:12:47.334
Brad? Come on!

142
00:12:54.207 --> 00:12:55.408
Hi.

143
00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:02.515
Think you can mess with me,
you little bastard, huh?

144
00:13:03.884 --> 00:13:06.419
You think that?
Think you can?

145
00:13:13.093 --> 00:13:14.862
Hi, Jane.
Hi, Brad.

146
00:13:15.562 --> 00:13:17.030
Who's your friend?

147
00:13:17.097 --> 00:13:18.498
Asshole tried to attack me.

148
00:13:18.565 --> 00:13:21.869
Oh, bad boy.
Think I should shoot him?

149
00:13:21.935 --> 00:13:23.436
No, I'll do it.

150
00:13:25.738 --> 00:13:28.075
Well, well, well.
Lookie-here.

151
00:13:29.709 --> 00:13:32.045
Caught yourself a deviant,
did you?

152
00:13:32.112 --> 00:13:33.881
I live here, you lunatics!

153
00:13:33.947 --> 00:13:34.982
Oops.

154
00:13:35.048 --> 00:13:36.249
What?

155
00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:38.485
Boy says he lives here, ma'am.

156
00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:42.222
I'm in 2B. Upstairs.
I just moved in.

157
00:13:42.289 --> 00:13:43.723
He's making it up.

158
00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:49.029
Listen, hot stuff,
are you 2B, or not?

159
00:13:49.096 --> 00:13:51.431
Yes, damn! I'm 2B!

160
00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:53.600
Well, all-rightie, then.

161
00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:56.369
I just got you wired up for the
great wide world and everything in it.

162
00:14:03.443 --> 00:14:05.078
I saw the whole thing.

163
00:14:09.549 --> 00:14:11.018
It was a mistake.

164
00:14:12.219 --> 00:14:14.321
Don't be so sure.
Are you ok?

165
00:14:15.088 --> 00:14:16.423
Yeah.

166
00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:19.993
Come on.

167
00:14:36.143 --> 00:14:38.545
This makes us neighbors,
I suppose.

168
00:14:38.611 --> 00:14:39.746
I'm Lisa.

169
00:14:39.812 --> 00:14:41.814
I'm Jones.
Hi.

170
00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:42.916
Hi.

171
00:14:42.983 --> 00:14:44.584
You can keep them if you want.

172
00:14:44.651 --> 00:14:46.086
Call it a housewarming.

173
00:14:46.153 --> 00:14:47.154
Thank you.

174
00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:51.158
I... I'd ask you to stay.

175
00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:54.494
And I'd ask you,
"where would I sit?"

176
00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.431
You can sit here.

177
00:14:59.866 --> 00:15:02.869
I think it's much too soon for that,
don't you?

178
00:15:04.004 --> 00:15:05.538
Goodbye, Jones.

179
00:15:12.545 --> 00:15:13.746
Hello?

00:15:13.813 --> 00:15:15.448
Hello, Blanche.
Guess who?

181
00:15:15.515 --> 00:15:18.685
Oh, lovely.
My only begotten son.

182
00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:21.221
Don't tell me they kicked
you out of school already.

183
00:15:21.288 --> 00:15:23.991
I wasn't expecting this call
for at least a month.

184
00:15:24.057 --> 00:15:26.994
Relax, Blanche.
You'll spill your drink.

185
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.629
I'm calling with good news.

186
00:15:29.696 --> 00:15:32.265
I'm calling from
my very own phone.

187
00:15:32.332 --> 00:15:35.335
From the comfort
of my very own apartment.

188
00:15:35.402 --> 00:15:37.904
Your what?

189
00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:39.906
Have you lost your mind, Jones?

190
00:15:39.973 --> 00:15:41.774
If there's anyone in this world

191
00:15:41.841 --> 00:15:44.244
who cannot take care
of himself, it is you.

192
00:15:44.311 --> 00:15:45.378
Do you hear me?

193
00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:47.014
No, you're right.

194
00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.983
In fact, I've been
interviewing help all week.

195
00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.585
I'm leaning towards this
beautiful young Asian girl.

196
00:15:52.652 --> 00:15:53.820
Cantonese.

197
00:15:53.886 --> 00:15:55.555
Cantonese, I mean.

198
00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:58.025
She's expert in ancient
massage techniques.

199
00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.893
See there? I knew it.

200
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.564
All those prep schools turned you
into a little sex monster, didn't they?

201
00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:06.566
Blanche, I called
to ask you something.

202
00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:08.668
Oh, god, here we go.

203
00:16:08.735 --> 00:16:10.737
I'm going to need a copy
of my birth certificate.

204
00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:11.871
It's for the school.

205
00:16:11.938 --> 00:16:13.140
Yeah, I bet.

206
00:16:13.206 --> 00:16:15.375
Well, have the school
get in touch with me then.

207
00:16:15.442 --> 00:16:17.010
I have a right, Blanche.

208
00:16:17.077 --> 00:16:18.345
For Christ's sake!

209
00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:20.180
Jones, couldn't we just
have a conversation

210
00:16:20.247 --> 00:16:23.516
where you didn't dredge up all
the footnotes of your ancestry?

211
00:16:23.583 --> 00:16:25.752
What if I called
your father a footnote?

212
00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:28.755
Yeah, well, just don't call him an
overbearing, manipulative son of a bitch.

213
00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:30.790
I'd hate for us to
agree on something, Jones.

214
00:16:30.857 --> 00:16:33.026
I think my own father
would like to know where I am,

215
00:16:33.093 --> 00:16:34.294
what I'm doing.

216
00:16:35.928 --> 00:16:38.265
It's late. You probably
have school tomorrow.

217
00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:39.666
Uh, Jones?

218
00:16:39.732 --> 00:16:41.534
Don't you dare. Jones?

219
00:16:41.601 --> 00:16:43.303
Well, son of a...

220
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:44.371
Bitch.

221
00:16:48.241 --> 00:16:50.743
I have done something
to make you angry?

222
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.945
No, not you.

223
00:17:07.994 --> 00:17:10.997
Yes, indeed, Mr. Jones.

224
00:17:11.064 --> 00:17:14.234
A happy bed makes
for a happy home,

225
00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:16.103
and Ma, here, is
going to show you

226
00:17:16.169 --> 00:17:20.107
just how happy a home can be.

227
00:17:20.173 --> 00:17:22.142
Well, my bed
hasn't been delivered yet.

228
00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:25.011
Just you leave everything to me.

229
00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.916
I'd have called first
if I had that number.

230
00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:34.387
Yes, indeed, Mr. Jones.

231
00:17:48.501 --> 00:17:51.171
Get comfortable,
Mr. Jones.

232
00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.114
Oh!

233
00:18:01.181 --> 00:18:03.750
Mr. Jones,
you are a handsome devil.

234
00:18:04.817 --> 00:18:07.053
Oh, my. Yes!

235
00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.389
Oh!

236
00:18:09.456 --> 00:18:10.457
Shh!

237
00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:15.662
Look at how happy you are!

238
00:18:16.896 --> 00:18:18.465
Just a minute,
Mr. Jones.

239
00:18:18.531 --> 00:18:21.334
Here comes your bed now!

240
00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.206
Treat me wild.

241
00:18:26.273 --> 00:18:27.274
Ooh!

242
00:18:38.251 --> 00:18:39.686
Oh, Mr. Jones.

243
00:18:39.752 --> 00:18:40.853
Rough,

244
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.589
just like your daddy was.

245
00:18:48.228 --> 00:18:49.896
Jones!

246
00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:05.645
Damn.

247
00:19:13.286 --> 00:19:14.554
Jones!

248
00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:22.295
No, don't!

249
00:19:25.432 --> 00:19:27.567
One, two.

250
00:19:27.634 --> 00:19:28.635
No!

251
00:19:42.081 --> 00:19:44.484
Boy, there's something
you probably ought to know.

252
00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:46.919
You got shit-wipe
sticking out of your fly.

253
00:19:54.961 --> 00:19:56.195
Don't. Please!

254
00:19:56.263 --> 00:19:57.430
One, two...

255
00:19:57.497 --> 00:19:58.498
Freeze!

256
00:19:59.866 --> 00:20:03.536
Put it down, fellas.
Nice and easy.

257
00:20:03.603 --> 00:20:05.605
We can't very well do nothing,

258
00:20:05.672 --> 00:20:07.407
bein' as we's frozen, and all.

259
00:20:07.474 --> 00:20:09.676
Bad joke, daddy-o.

260
00:20:09.742 --> 00:20:13.546
One more and I blow your little sister's
best friend right out of your trousers.

261
00:20:31.431 --> 00:20:33.733
You think they treat all
of their customers that way?

262
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.468
No, you're just lucky.

263
00:20:35.535 --> 00:20:36.736
Lucky you were there.

264
00:20:36.803 --> 00:20:38.070
There, that's all of it.

265
00:20:38.137 --> 00:20:40.707
Wow. If you hadn't shown up
like that, I don't know.

266
00:20:40.773 --> 00:20:43.776
Let me get you a beer.
"Freeze!"

267
00:20:43.843 --> 00:20:45.512
The looks on their faces.

268
00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:46.613
Hi, Brad.

269
00:20:46.679 --> 00:20:47.780
And who would've ever guessed

270
00:20:47.847 --> 00:20:49.048
those guys could be so polite?

271
00:20:49.115 --> 00:20:50.317
You go easy on him.

272
00:20:50.383 --> 00:20:51.384
Ok.

273
00:20:56.188 --> 00:20:59.158
Easily the most exciting
thing I've ever seen in real life.

274
00:20:59.225 --> 00:21:00.393
Hi.

275
00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:01.494
Hi.

276
00:21:01.561 --> 00:21:02.562
Where's...

277
00:21:02.629 --> 00:21:03.630
Gone.

278
00:21:05.465 --> 00:21:08.167
Look. Now you can stay.

279
00:21:08.234 --> 00:21:09.302
You want a beer?

280
00:21:09.369 --> 00:21:11.771
Oh, I'm gonna
have to take a rain check.

281
00:21:11.838 --> 00:21:13.239
I have lines to learn.

282
00:21:13.306 --> 00:21:14.941
You're an actress.

283
00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:16.509
The female lead.

284
00:21:16.576 --> 00:21:17.877
Wow.

285
00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:20.246
Besides, I still don't know
where I would sit.

286
00:21:21.714 --> 00:21:23.750
Are you sure that's clean?

287
00:21:29.856 --> 00:21:31.391
Your stalker has furniture.

288
00:21:48.775 --> 00:21:49.776
Hi.

289
00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:52.645
You ok?

290
00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:56.916
Yeah, sure. How are you?

291
00:21:59.552 --> 00:22:00.953
Great couch.

292
00:22:05.725 --> 00:22:07.860
Dear dad,

293
00:22:07.927 --> 00:22:10.262
I'm settling into
apartment life just fine.

294
00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:12.599
I know it was more your style
to move around a lot,

295
00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:15.902
place to place,
but I think I'll stay right here for now.

296
00:22:15.968 --> 00:22:17.537
And why not?

297
00:22:17.604 --> 00:22:20.106
Seems like every time I turn around,
I make new friends.

298
00:22:40.793 --> 00:22:41.928
She's been hit!

299
00:22:41.994 --> 00:22:44.196
Let's get!

300
00:22:44.263 --> 00:22:45.732
I'm comin', I'm comin'.

301
00:22:46.633 --> 00:22:48.568
Come on!

No, no, darling,
they've waited long enough.

313
00:24:04.243 --> 00:24:05.612
I've waited.

314
00:24:05.678 --> 00:24:07.880
Oh, how I've waited for you.

315
00:24:07.947 --> 00:24:12.151
Each day a lifetime,
centuries longer than the day before it.

316
00:24:12.218 --> 00:24:13.986
And it would've been...

317
00:24:15.788 --> 00:24:17.289
Would've been...

318
00:24:18.758 --> 00:24:20.927
Almost bearable.

319
00:24:20.993 --> 00:24:23.029
And it would've been
almost bearable

320
00:24:23.095 --> 00:24:25.998
if, just once,
you'd written me a letter to tell me

321
00:24:26.065 --> 00:24:27.667
that you were still alive,

322
00:24:27.734 --> 00:24:31.170
and that your love for me
was still alive, too.

323
00:24:31.237 --> 00:24:34.406
How could I have known you
lost both your arms in battle?

324
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.980
Damn you. Haven't I told you
never to speak of that? Never!

325
00:24:41.047 --> 00:24:43.182
You foolish, proud man.

326
00:24:43.249 --> 00:24:45.217
Don't you see it doesn't matter?

327
00:24:45.284 --> 00:24:47.353
You can still touch me.

328
00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:49.789
You've still a heart to love me.

329
00:24:49.856 --> 00:24:52.158
Still lips to kiss me.

330
00:24:52.224 --> 00:24:54.326
You can touch me without arms.

331
00:24:54.393 --> 00:24:57.496
And I need you to,
darling, desperately.

332
00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.767
Please, touch me.

333
00:25:01.634 --> 00:25:03.402
Touch me now.

334
00:25:03.469 --> 00:25:06.072
Touch me right now!

335
00:25:09.075 --> 00:25:11.578
Blah, blah, blah.

336
00:25:11.644 --> 00:25:13.646
God, it's awful.

337
00:25:13.713 --> 00:25:14.947
Well, you're good.

338
00:25:15.014 --> 00:25:16.382
Really?

339
00:25:16.448 --> 00:25:18.785
I mean, not just
compared to you?

340
00:25:28.595 --> 00:25:29.896
A glass, please?

341
00:25:29.962 --> 00:25:32.364
Oh, well, I don't have any yet.

342
00:25:32.431 --> 00:25:33.432
Sorry.

343
00:25:35.868 --> 00:25:38.971
You know, I find it
awfully sad, really.

344
00:25:39.038 --> 00:25:41.040
Well, I'm going to get some.

345
00:25:41.107 --> 00:25:42.709
No, not that.

346
00:25:48.547 --> 00:25:51.017
You know, a person
can pursue something.

347
00:25:51.083 --> 00:25:52.484
A girl can go after her dream

348
00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:56.522
and give it her energy,
labor, sweat, tears,

349
00:25:57.924 --> 00:26:02.361
and this is where it gets her.

350
00:26:02.428 --> 00:26:06.565
A two-room apartment and a
role in some moronic period play.

351
00:26:12.071 --> 00:26:14.240
Things take time?

352
00:26:14.306 --> 00:26:17.043
Right.
Things take time.

353
00:26:18.277 --> 00:26:19.812
I suppose.

354
00:26:21.013 --> 00:26:23.015
But I can't wait forever.

355
00:26:25.384 --> 00:26:26.886
Can I ask you something?

356
00:26:27.319 --> 00:26:28.888
Sure.

357
00:26:28.955 --> 00:26:31.090
You can ask me anything.

358
00:26:31.157 --> 00:26:33.259
Who's the girl with the camera?

359
00:26:35.194 --> 00:26:37.563
She's called Jane.
Why?

360
00:26:39.065 --> 00:26:42.635
Well, she took
my picture, out here.

361
00:26:42.702 --> 00:26:46.773
She didn't say a word,
just took my picture and disappeared.

362
00:26:46.839 --> 00:26:47.907
It was weird.

363
00:26:47.974 --> 00:26:49.976
She is weird.

364
00:26:50.042 --> 00:26:52.679
You know what?
I'd be careful if I were you.

365
00:26:52.745 --> 00:26:56.315
She took pictures of me once,
and now she hates me.

366
00:26:56.382 --> 00:26:58.150
Hates you? Why?

367
00:26:58.918 --> 00:27:00.552
I have no idea.

368
00:27:00.619 --> 00:27:03.555
Except, I think she's maybe
slightly insane.

369
00:27:04.356 --> 00:27:05.624
Insane?

370
00:27:07.426 --> 00:27:08.560
Wow.

00:28:47.159 --> 00:28:49.896
Hi. Uh, I'm Jones.

390
00:28:49.962 --> 00:28:52.098
I'm your neighbor
from down the hall.

391
00:28:52.164 --> 00:28:53.833
I think we're past that.

392
00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:55.567
Right.

393
00:28:55.634 --> 00:28:57.736
I noticed you take
pictures and I can't seem

394
00:28:57.804 --> 00:29:01.974
to figure this out,
so I thought maybe you could...

395
00:29:02.041 --> 00:29:04.844
I don't know much about
them. Is this one any good?

396
00:29:04.911 --> 00:29:06.913
Yeah, it's fine.

397
00:29:06.979 --> 00:29:10.082
Fine if you're going to
Disneyland with a wife and kids.

398
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:11.550
Right.

399
00:29:11.617 --> 00:29:15.788
Well, I guess I'll have to plan
a trip then, and a wedding.

400
00:29:15.855 --> 00:29:17.523
Here. Point and shoot.

401
00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:19.191
Right.

402
00:29:19.258 --> 00:29:22.361
Uh, how did that picture
come out... On the roof?

403
00:29:23.863 --> 00:29:25.197
Not so hot.

404
00:29:26.732 --> 00:29:29.035
What did you say
your name was again?

405
00:29:29.101 --> 00:29:30.136
Jones.

406
00:29:30.702 --> 00:29:31.804
I'm Jane.

407
00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:33.639
Hi.

408
00:29:33.705 --> 00:29:35.074
Bye, Jones.

409
00:29:40.712 --> 00:29:41.713
Ready?

410
00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:42.949
Ready.

411
00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:45.784
Beer?

412
00:29:45.852 --> 00:29:49.155
Oh! Oh, my, no, no.
This calls for wine.

413
00:29:49.221 --> 00:29:51.123
I have a terrific bottle
I've been saving.

414
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:53.292
You have a corkscrew, right?

415
00:29:55.327 --> 00:29:56.428
Damn.

416
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.605
Here, let me.
It's a sticky one.

417
00:30:14.914 --> 00:30:16.782
And that's how it started.

418
00:30:16.849 --> 00:30:19.051
She opened the wine
and started to pour,

419
00:30:19.118 --> 00:30:21.954
and pour, and pour,
like words on a page.

420
00:30:22.021 --> 00:30:25.691
Big words like "ambition,"
and "inspiration," and "passion."

421
00:30:25.757 --> 00:30:28.961
Me? I didn't say much,
but she didn't mind.

422
00:30:29.028 --> 00:30:30.396
She knew I was watching her.

423
00:30:30.462 --> 00:30:32.164
I think she likes
to be looked at,

424
00:30:32.231 --> 00:30:34.433
but I wanted
to do more than look.

425
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.736
After all, I couldn't type, could I,
if I didn't touch the keys?

426
00:30:37.803 --> 00:30:40.139
And she was so close,
it should have been easy,

427
00:30:40.206 --> 00:30:42.841
but somewhere, somehow,
I think I missed something.

428
00:30:42.909 --> 00:30:44.010
You know what I mean?

429
00:30:44.076 --> 00:30:45.111
Yeah.

430
00:30:45.177 --> 00:30:46.312
You do?

431
00:30:46.378 --> 00:30:47.579
No.

432
00:30:47.646 --> 00:30:48.948
You don't?

433
00:30:49.015 --> 00:30:50.349
I don't know.

434
00:30:53.785 --> 00:30:56.222
I'm sorry. It's late.

435
00:30:56.956 --> 00:30:59.358
I'm drunk. I have to go.

436
00:31:46.572 --> 00:31:48.240
Morning, partner.

437
00:31:53.679 --> 00:31:56.482
Shouldn't I have handcuffs, too?

438
00:31:56.548 --> 00:31:59.952
Sorry, partner.
I've only got one pair.

439
00:32:00.019 --> 00:32:02.254
Don't you think
we should drink them first?

440
00:32:02.321 --> 00:32:05.257
No. You'd never
hit 'em that way.

441
00:32:11.763 --> 00:32:13.499
That's right.

442
00:32:13.565 --> 00:32:15.301
Steady.

443
00:32:15.367 --> 00:32:17.669
Use your sight.
Line it up.

444
00:32:17.736 --> 00:32:19.505
Now what are you gonna do?

445
00:32:19.571 --> 00:32:21.040
Squeeze.

446
00:32:21.107 --> 00:32:22.441
Squeeze.

447
00:32:23.742 --> 00:32:25.444
What are you not going to do?

448
00:32:25.511 --> 00:32:26.678
Pull.

449
00:32:26.745 --> 00:32:27.879
Beautiful.

450
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.282
Whenever you're ready.

451
00:32:36.288 --> 00:32:38.690
Perfect. You squeezed.

452
00:33:39.185 --> 00:33:40.952
So what do you think of Lisa?

453
00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:42.088
Lisa?

454
00:33:43.055 --> 00:33:45.457
Yeah, upstairs Lisa.

455
00:33:46.325 --> 00:33:48.127
How do you mean?

456
00:33:48.194 --> 00:33:50.362
Well, you're seeing her,
aren't you?

457
00:33:50.429 --> 00:33:52.331
Did she say something to you?

458
00:33:52.398 --> 00:33:53.599
No.

459
00:33:54.566 --> 00:33:55.767
I just know.

460
00:33:56.935 --> 00:33:58.070
How?

461
00:33:58.137 --> 00:33:59.638
It's an old house.

462
00:33:59.705 --> 00:34:02.574
I know the creaks.
I know what goes on.

463
00:34:02.641 --> 00:34:05.111
When she's in her bathroom,
brushing her teeth,

464
00:34:05.177 --> 00:34:07.713
putting on just a bit
of eye make-up.

465
00:34:07.779 --> 00:34:11.383
I hear her move
from her apartment to yours.

466
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:14.986
You let her in, she looks great.

467
00:34:15.053 --> 00:34:16.455
She takes a seat on the couch,

468
00:34:16.522 --> 00:34:18.257
makes herself comfortable.

469
00:34:18.324 --> 00:34:20.626
You offer her
something to drink.

470
00:34:20.692 --> 00:34:23.495
You excuse yourself
to the kitchen.

471
00:34:23.562 --> 00:34:25.964
"Mineral water
or I have a light beer?"

472
00:34:26.031 --> 00:34:29.401
"Mineral water, please.
In a glass if you don't mind?"

473
00:34:30.136 --> 00:34:31.670
Mineral water?

474
00:34:32.438 --> 00:34:33.572
Oh, come on.

475
00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:35.307
It's not like
I'm snooping, really.

476
00:34:35.374 --> 00:34:36.608
I just hear it.

477
00:34:36.675 --> 00:34:38.777
There's a lot of
turnover upstairs.

478
00:34:38.844 --> 00:34:41.613
And everybody leaves
a story behind.

479
00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.982
Now, I can tell those stories,

480
00:34:44.049 --> 00:34:45.251
but I don't.

481
00:34:45.317 --> 00:34:47.886
And I won't tell yours,
either, Jones.

482
00:34:51.022 --> 00:34:52.524
Together, this time.

483
00:34:52.591 --> 00:34:55.060
Six on the left are mine,
right are yours.

484
00:34:59.865 --> 00:35:02.334
I love what you're
doing with the place.

485
00:35:02.401 --> 00:35:03.535
Thanks.

486
00:35:03.602 --> 00:35:04.870
It's called acting.

487
00:35:04.936 --> 00:35:07.773
Right. That, that...

488
00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:09.208
Thing?

489
00:35:09.275 --> 00:35:11.810
That thing is a product of...

490
00:35:12.878 --> 00:35:14.380

I can hear you breathing.

503
00:36:13.972 --> 00:36:15.073
Jane?

504
00:36:23.549 --> 00:36:26.151
You listen to me,
you pathetic little bastard!

505
00:36:26.218 --> 00:36:27.853
How did you know it was me?

506
00:36:27.919 --> 00:36:30.222
You think you're cute,
don't you?

507
00:36:30.289 --> 00:36:31.890
Oh, for Christ's sake, Jones!

508
00:36:31.957 --> 00:36:33.625
You cook a meal for a man

509
00:36:33.692 --> 00:36:34.826
just once...

510
00:36:34.893 --> 00:36:36.795
And he thinks he can
call you on the phone.

511
00:36:36.862 --> 00:36:40.566
What he thinks is that he's
got a god-given right to tell me

512
00:36:40.632 --> 00:36:44.102
what to do, where to go,
and what time to be there.

513
00:36:44.169 --> 00:36:46.104
Maybe he wants to
show you the world.

514
00:36:46.838 --> 00:36:48.707
Istanbul, Mozambique.

515
00:36:48.774 --> 00:36:50.075
What are you talking about?

516
00:36:50.141 --> 00:36:53.479
You know what I'm
talking about! My father.

517
00:36:53.545 --> 00:36:55.881
You said he'd been everywhere,
seen everything.

518
00:36:55.947 --> 00:37:00.386
That he'd written it all down...
every sight, every sound...

519
00:37:00.452 --> 00:37:02.488
So that when he met you
he could show you the world.

520
00:37:02.554 --> 00:37:03.955
I never told you that.

521
00:37:04.022 --> 00:37:05.657
He told me that.

522
00:37:05.724 --> 00:37:08.159
I remember more
than you think I do.

523
00:37:08.226 --> 00:37:10.362
You know, I'm getting
dressed, here, Jones.

524
00:37:11.497 --> 00:37:13.432
What did you do, Blanche?

525
00:37:13.499 --> 00:37:16.302
What did you do that was
so bad he left both of us?

526
00:37:16.368 --> 00:37:18.837
You know,
if you gave school half the energy

527
00:37:18.904 --> 00:37:21.473
you give this little
genealogy project,

528
00:37:22.774 --> 00:37:24.976
I bet you they'd name
a building after you.

529
00:37:25.043 --> 00:37:27.413
I am taking it seriously.

530
00:37:27.479 --> 00:37:30.616
In fact, there's an instructor
here, right now.

531
00:37:30.682 --> 00:37:32.884
Oh, instructor, hell.
What instructor?

532
00:37:32.951 --> 00:37:34.152
It's art class.

533
00:37:34.219 --> 00:37:35.854
We're doing nudes this week.

534
00:37:36.522 --> 00:37:38.089
Wow.

535
00:37:38.156 --> 00:37:41.327
But she said I could sketch
some gin bottles for extra credit.

536
00:37:41.393 --> 00:37:43.061
I'll send you one.

537
00:38:11.022 --> 00:38:13.659
How I've waited for you.

538
00:38:13.725 --> 00:38:17.763
Each day a lifetime,
centuries longer than the day before it.

539
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:19.565
And it would've been
almost bearable

540
00:38:19.631 --> 00:38:21.633
if just once you'd
written me a letter

541
00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.835
to tell me that you were alive.

542
00:38:23.902 --> 00:38:26.505
And that your love for me was still alive,
too.

543
00:38:26.572 --> 00:38:27.673
Damn you!

544
00:38:29.441 --> 00:38:32.243
I thought I told you
never to speak of that.

545
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:33.311
Never!

546
00:38:43.221 --> 00:38:45.724
I know you got it,
you chicken shit!

547
00:38:48.293 --> 00:38:50.028
You can still touch me.

548
00:38:50.095 --> 00:38:52.297
You've still a heart to love me.

549
00:38:52.364 --> 00:38:56.167
Still lips to kiss me. You
can touch me without arms.

550
00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:01.239
I need you to, darling,
desperately.

551
00:39:02.841 --> 00:39:05.243
Please, touch me.

552
00:39:10.616 --> 00:39:12.551
Touch me right now!

553
00:39:19.257 --> 00:39:21.693
At least someone's
been rehearsing.

554
00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:26.898
It was bad, wasn't it?

555
00:39:28.534 --> 00:39:30.168
You can tell me.

556
00:39:33.405 --> 00:39:35.941
You were good.

557
00:39:36.007 --> 00:39:39.878
Can you say that again, please,
with just a little bit more feeling?

558
00:39:40.746 --> 00:39:42.280
You were good.

559
00:39:46.685 --> 00:39:47.886
Jones?

560
00:39:51.056 --> 00:39:53.158
Will you kiss me?

561
00:39:54.325 --> 00:39:55.894
Ok.

562
00:39:55.961 --> 00:39:57.763
"Ok," because you want to,

563
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:59.765
or "ok," because I asked you to?

564
00:40:01.132 --> 00:40:02.834
I want to.

565
00:40:02.901 --> 00:40:04.936
Will you do it now, please?

566
00:40:05.003 --> 00:40:06.371
Ok, I will, but...

567
00:40:16.682 --> 00:40:20.018
Sorry. I'm not
very good at this.

568
00:40:20.085 --> 00:40:23.288
Oh, but you will be.
You will be.

569
00:40:29.961 --> 00:40:33.732
Let me tell you
the story of a girl

570
00:40:33.799 --> 00:40:37.335
there was not another
like her in the world

571
00:40:37.402 --> 00:40:41.406
I'm sure I won't be
the last to tell of her

572
00:40:41.473 --> 00:40:45.477
I'm sure I ain't
the first guy in the world

573
00:40:45.544 --> 00:40:49.247
to hear her tell a lie,
to see her start to cry

574
00:40:49.314 --> 00:40:51.583
I know she's got
nothing on her mind

575
00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:53.118
what are you waiting for?

576
00:40:53.184 --> 00:40:54.285
Who could ever say

577
00:40:54.352 --> 00:40:55.587
um.

578
00:40:55.654 --> 00:40:56.955
She'd be unkind

579
00:40:57.022 --> 00:40:58.857
this isn't your
first time, is it?

580
00:40:58.924 --> 00:41:00.959
Could be the way
she got her start

581
00:41:01.026 --> 00:41:02.761
could be

582
00:41:02.828 --> 00:41:04.395
what?
What?

583
00:41:04.462 --> 00:41:05.897
Are you serious?

584
00:41:07.298 --> 00:41:08.767
Jones,

585
00:41:08.834 --> 00:41:11.302
my god.
What do you think this is?

586
00:41:11.369 --> 00:41:13.271
Nothing. I mean...

587
00:41:13.338 --> 00:41:15.140
God, exactly. You know what?

588
00:41:15.206 --> 00:41:17.242
You can't do this with me.

589
00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:19.344
Not like this. I mean,

590
00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:21.580
Jones, you're really sweet
and everything,

591
00:41:21.647 --> 00:41:23.649
but, my god, how old
are you anyway?

592
00:41:23.715 --> 00:41:24.716
Seventeen.

593
00:41:24.783 --> 00:41:26.585
Seventeen?

594
00:41:26.652 --> 00:41:29.320
My god, what am I doing?
You know what, Jones?

595
00:41:29.387 --> 00:41:31.256
You need to fall in love first.

596
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.991
Love?

597
00:41:33.058 --> 00:41:34.059
Yes.

598
00:41:34.125 --> 00:41:36.427
Love! Seventeen-year-olds
can fall in love.

599
00:41:36.494 --> 00:41:37.929
By the time I was seventeen,

600
00:41:37.996 --> 00:41:40.031
I'd already loved three or four boys.

601
00:41:40.098 --> 00:41:42.233
Like, really truly loved them.

602
00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.334
You're right.

603
00:41:43.401 --> 00:41:44.636
Of course, I'm right.

604
00:41:44.703 --> 00:41:47.105
Trust me on this, Jones.
You don't want to do this.

605
00:41:47.172 --> 00:41:48.306
You're right.

606
00:41:48.373 --> 00:41:50.408
You think you do, but...

607
00:41:50.475 --> 00:41:51.943
What did you say?

608
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:53.511
I said, "you're right."

609
00:41:53.579 --> 00:41:54.946
Right about what?

610
00:41:55.013 --> 00:41:57.549
About this, about us.

611
00:41:57.616 --> 00:41:59.484
I... I don't want to.
Like you said.

612
00:41:59.551 --> 00:42:00.686
What?

613
00:42:05.991 --> 00:42:07.659
Ok, the show's over.

614
00:42:07.726 --> 00:42:09.094
I'm through being an audience,

615
00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.829
just looking on and listening.

616
00:42:10.896 --> 00:42:12.598
I want someone
who's more than words.

617
00:42:12.664 --> 00:42:15.166
Because if I've learned
anything so far, it's this:

618
00:42:15.233 --> 00:42:17.302
Talk is cheap, partner.

619
00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:19.838
So you say it's a party you want,
huh?

620
00:42:19.905 --> 00:42:22.708
Hell, woman,
I'll show you a party.

621
00:42:22.774 --> 00:42:25.376
What did I tell you about coming
down here and celebrating?

622
00:42:25.443 --> 00:42:28.413
Damn it,
I've got dishes at home that need washing!

623
00:42:28.479 --> 00:42:30.582
You've done crossed me
for the last time.

624
00:42:30.649 --> 00:42:32.884
Speak up, damn it,
I'm talking to you!

625
00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.896
Oh, dear god, help me.

626
00:42:44.963 --> 00:42:46.598
It's Jones Dillon.

627
00:42:46.665 --> 00:42:49.400
Coming to kill me.

628
00:42:49.467 --> 00:42:54.339
Please, Dillon,
I wasn't gonna hurt her. Honest.

629
00:42:54.405 --> 00:42:59.144
You'd best say goodbye to them buttons,
you no-arm son of a bitch.

630
00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:01.613
Mr. Dillon.

631
00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.415
You have a shave scheduled,
Mr. Dillon.

632
00:43:06.484 --> 00:43:07.686
A shave.

633
00:43:10.722 --> 00:43:12.123
And a bath?

634
00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:19.698
That's me.

635
00:43:21.066 --> 00:43:22.500
But Jones,

636
00:43:22.567 --> 00:43:24.235
this animal said he was going

637
00:43:24.302 --> 00:43:27.438
to roll me down main street!

638
00:43:27.505 --> 00:43:30.909
Down main street,
right out of town, one kick at a time.

639
00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:33.812
Squeeze.

640
00:43:35.781 --> 00:43:37.783
With spurs on, Jones!

641
00:44:21.592 --> 00:44:23.361
I need a ride.

642
00:44:25.964 --> 00:44:27.465
You didn't have to do this.

643
00:44:27.532 --> 00:44:29.034
That's ok.

644
00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:30.869
I've been meaning
to buy some records.

645
00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:34.672
We don't sell records.

646
00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:38.043
Oh. I thought you said
it was a record store.

647
00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:40.178
It's just called a record store.

648
00:44:40.245 --> 00:44:41.880
It's all CD's.

649
00:44:42.247 --> 00:44:43.815
Right.

650
00:44:43.882 --> 00:44:46.617
Well, I... I don't have
a record player anyway.

651
00:44:51.156 --> 00:44:54.392
♪ She says, so I guess this is it ♪

652
00:44:55.526 --> 00:44:57.763
♪ He said, I guess it is ♪

653
00:45:01.967 --> 00:45:04.635
♪ She touched his hand once ♪

654
00:45:05.871 --> 00:45:07.538
♪ And gave his head a kiss ♪

655
00:45:07.605 --> 00:45:09.975
Look, I don't care if you
don't like the picture, ok?

656
00:45:10.041 --> 00:45:11.342
What picture?

657
00:45:11.409 --> 00:45:13.044
It's not going
to hurt my feelings,

658
00:45:13.111 --> 00:45:15.639
but you could have at least
acknowledged the damn thing,

659
00:45:15.651 --> 00:45:16.492
you know?

660
00:45:17.148 --> 00:45:19.117
What picture?

661
00:45:19.184 --> 00:45:20.651
The picture I gave you.

662
00:45:20.718 --> 00:45:23.421
The picture
I slipped under your door!

663
00:45:23.488 --> 00:45:25.023
I put it in an envelope and...

664
00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:27.492
Look, there's no way
you didn't...

665
00:45:28.994 --> 00:45:31.596
Oh, god damn it.
She likes you, right?

666
00:45:31.662 --> 00:45:32.663
Who?

667
00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:34.599
Who? The bitch that...

668
00:45:36.434 --> 00:45:39.170
Just forget it,
forget it. I'm sorry.

669
00:45:39.237 --> 00:45:41.639
He slowly gripped

670
00:45:41.706 --> 00:45:44.375
are you coming in?

671
00:45:44.442 --> 00:45:48.546
No. I don't have
a CD player, either.

672
00:45:48.613 --> 00:45:50.681
Will you need a ride home?

673
00:45:50.748 --> 00:45:52.717
No. I'll manage.

674
00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:56.855
How about you?

675
00:45:56.922 --> 00:45:59.024
Took a stool next to her

676
00:46:00.525 --> 00:46:03.161
I'll ask the bartender

677
00:46:06.932 --> 00:46:09.300
he said, I'm just gonna lie

678
00:46:13.304 --> 00:46:15.073
ok, shut it off.

679
00:46:17.008 --> 00:46:18.676
That's great.

680
00:46:18.743 --> 00:46:20.745
How do you know
all of this stuff?

681
00:46:20.812 --> 00:46:23.048
I learned it from rocky.

682
00:46:23.114 --> 00:46:24.482
Who's rocky?

683
00:46:24.549 --> 00:46:26.717
That motorcycle in my apartment?

684
00:46:26.784 --> 00:46:27.986
Yeah.

685
00:46:28.053 --> 00:46:29.420
That's rocky's.

686
00:46:31.656 --> 00:46:34.492
He left that behind, the rogue.

687
00:46:36.227 --> 00:46:37.795
He was my last.

688
00:46:37.863 --> 00:46:39.865
He lived in your apartment
for a while,

689
00:46:39.931 --> 00:46:42.000
but he spent
most of his time in mine.

690
00:46:42.067 --> 00:46:43.734
Then he moved on.

691
00:46:45.236 --> 00:46:46.905
That was three years ago.

692
00:46:49.607 --> 00:46:50.775
Jones?

693
00:46:50.842 --> 00:46:52.844
Yeah?

694
00:46:52.911 --> 00:46:56.147
It's been three years
since I had sex, Jones.

695
00:46:56.214 --> 00:46:57.315
Whoa.

696
00:46:58.583 --> 00:47:00.919
Did you say "whoa"?

697
00:47:00.986 --> 00:47:03.388
Three years and you say, "whoa"?

698
00:47:03.454 --> 00:47:04.689
Listen, you,

699
00:47:04.755 --> 00:47:08.226
three years of celibacy
deserves more than "whoa."

700
00:47:08.293 --> 00:47:10.495
"Whoa" doesn't come close.

701
00:47:11.029 --> 00:47:12.730
Try seventeen.

702
00:47:12.797 --> 00:47:15.066
What, years?

703
00:47:15.133 --> 00:47:17.302
Well, the first twelve
were pretty easy.

704
00:47:17.368 --> 00:47:19.004
But what about...

705
00:47:20.171 --> 00:47:21.706
So you're a...

706
00:47:23.374 --> 00:47:24.675
Whoa.

707
00:47:39.357 --> 00:47:40.758
It's great.

708
00:47:41.759 --> 00:47:43.494
It's really great.

709
00:47:44.362 --> 00:47:45.663
It's the pain.

710
00:47:46.297 --> 00:47:47.598
The pain?

711
00:47:48.934 --> 00:47:51.202
That's why I like it,

712
00:47:51.269 --> 00:47:53.939
because it's honest
and it's real

713
00:47:54.005 --> 00:47:56.507
and it's nothing
you can fake or hide.

714
00:47:57.976 --> 00:48:00.045
I don't know.

715
00:48:00.111 --> 00:48:01.980
To me, it's like you're feeling
pain for the first time in your life.

716
00:48:02.047 --> 00:48:03.248
And before this moment,

717
00:48:03.314 --> 00:48:05.483
you didn't even know it existed.

718
00:48:06.551 --> 00:48:08.019
I broke my arm once

719
00:48:09.554 --> 00:48:10.855
when I was a kid.

720
00:48:16.294 --> 00:48:18.596
How is it that someone
you've only just met,

721
00:48:18.663 --> 00:48:20.065
that a person you hardly know,

722
00:48:20.131 --> 00:48:21.466
can somehow know you?

723
00:48:21.532 --> 00:48:23.401
Can take one look
at you and see more

724
00:48:23.468 --> 00:48:26.071
in that instant than most
people will ever see?

725
00:48:26.137 --> 00:48:28.573
I suppose there's only
one way to find out.

726
00:48:36.547 --> 00:48:37.682
Hi, Jane.

727
00:48:37.748 --> 00:48:38.783
Hi.

728
00:48:38.849 --> 00:48:40.718
Hi. Uh,

729
00:48:40.785 --> 00:48:42.620
I was wondering if you would,

730
00:48:42.687 --> 00:48:44.289
you know, if you'd like to

731
00:48:44.355 --> 00:48:45.623
go out on...

732
00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:48.026
You're a little
young for me, Jones.

733
00:48:48.093 --> 00:48:50.261
Besides, I don't date.

734
00:48:50.328 --> 00:48:51.862
Well, it wouldn't be a date.

735
00:48:51.929 --> 00:48:53.431
I just don't know
many people here

736
00:48:53.498 --> 00:48:55.200
and I thought, maybe we could...

737
00:48:55.266 --> 00:48:57.668
Maybe you should get
a record player.

738
00:48:57.735 --> 00:48:59.637
But we don't have to.

739
00:49:02.974 --> 00:49:04.909
I don't do movies,

740
00:49:04.976 --> 00:49:06.377
no dinners,

741
00:49:06.444 --> 00:49:08.213
no picnics,

742
00:49:08.279 --> 00:49:09.614
no walks.

743
00:49:10.648 --> 00:49:11.949
How about you decide?

744
00:49:16.521 --> 00:49:17.922
I hear you typing a lot.

745
00:49:17.989 --> 00:49:19.457
What are you writing?

746
00:49:19.524 --> 00:49:21.292
Letters, mostly.

747
00:49:21.359 --> 00:49:23.294
Letters to who, your girlfriend?

748
00:49:24.662 --> 00:49:26.297
Girlfriends...

749
00:49:26.364 --> 00:49:27.698
There are several.

750
00:49:28.733 --> 00:49:30.201
Is that right?

751
00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:33.771
Get the fuck out of here!

752
00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:48.419
Superfecta's the big one.
The first four horses in order...

753
00:49:48.486 --> 00:49:50.755
A bitch to win,
but top-dollar pay.

754
00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:52.357
Trifecta is the same deal,

755
00:49:52.423 --> 00:49:54.525
but the first three horses in order.

756
00:49:54.592 --> 00:49:56.994
Still's a bitch,
still good money.

757
00:49:57.062 --> 00:49:59.397
Exacta bet is first
and second in order.

758
00:49:59.464 --> 00:50:00.865
Quinella is the same,

759
00:50:00.931 --> 00:50:02.733
but in any order.
So those are good.

760
00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.135
Win, place, or show bets,

761
00:50:04.202 --> 00:50:06.271
you can figure out for yourself.

762
00:50:06.337 --> 00:50:08.173
Are you talking to me?

763
00:50:08.239 --> 00:50:10.508
Yes, dummy. How do
you want to bet?

764
00:50:10.575 --> 00:50:12.277
I have no idea.

765
00:50:12.343 --> 00:50:15.080
How about you bet for me
and I'll get us some drinks?

766
00:50:15.946 --> 00:50:17.082
Sure you will.

767
00:50:48.413 --> 00:50:50.081
How did you do that?

768
00:50:50.148 --> 00:50:51.849
A trick I learned
from my mother.

769
00:50:52.983 --> 00:50:54.519
So what are we drinking to?

770
00:50:56.687 --> 00:50:58.356
Close your eyes and point.

771
00:51:03.761 --> 00:51:04.962
"New in town."

772
00:51:05.029 --> 00:51:06.030
"New in town."

773
00:51:06.097 --> 00:51:07.432
Yes!

774
00:51:07.498 --> 00:51:10.601

00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:27.185

Little bee, run!

789
00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:21.206
I used to go there
a lot with Steve.

790
00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:24.375
And he always lost his ass.

791
00:52:24.442 --> 00:52:26.711
I guess that's why I can
still stand it there.

792
00:52:29.947 --> 00:52:32.617
This is the part where
you ask me who Steve is.

793
00:52:33.384 --> 00:52:34.652
No, it isn't.

794
00:52:36.621 --> 00:52:37.755
Fair enough.

795
00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:41.025
Then I'll ask you something.

796
00:52:41.792 --> 00:52:43.027
Name?

797
00:52:43.093 --> 00:52:44.229
Jones Dillon.

798
00:52:45.296 --> 00:52:46.464
Age?

799
00:52:46.531 --> 00:52:47.532
Seventeen.

800
00:52:48.466 --> 00:52:49.467
From?

801
00:52:49.534 --> 00:52:50.768
Texas.

802
00:52:52.102 --> 00:52:53.971
No funny accent.

803
00:52:54.038 --> 00:52:55.706
I grew up in the east, mostly.

804
00:52:56.874 --> 00:52:57.908
Me, too.

805
00:52:59.877 --> 00:53:02.079
Boarding schools
and summer camps.

806
00:53:02.146 --> 00:53:03.514
What about your parents?

807
00:53:04.582 --> 00:53:06.484
What parents?

808
00:53:06.551 --> 00:53:08.786
How many orphans go
to boarding schools?

809
00:53:08.853 --> 00:53:09.920
Lots.

810
00:53:09.987 --> 00:53:11.088
Who's Steve?

811
00:53:12.923 --> 00:53:14.359
I thought you didn't
want to know.

812
00:53:15.426 --> 00:53:16.927
He's your old boyfriend?

813
00:53:18.529 --> 00:53:20.097
One of several.

814
00:53:20.164 --> 00:53:21.799
Are you telling me
you're an orphan?

815
00:53:22.567 --> 00:53:24.134
Not exactly.

816
00:53:24.201 --> 00:53:25.436
How many is several?

817
00:53:26.637 --> 00:53:28.306
Wouldn't you like to know?

818
00:53:28.373 --> 00:53:29.940
I just want to know about one.

819
00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:34.412
That's it.
Out of film.

820
00:53:34.479 --> 00:53:35.846
That's it?

821
00:53:35.913 --> 00:53:38.215
Why? You thought you
were getting somewhere?

822
00:53:44.789 --> 00:53:47.592
So is there anything else
I should know about you?

823
00:53:47.658 --> 00:53:50.160
I don't think so,

824
00:53:50.227 --> 00:53:51.629
unless...

825
00:53:51.696 --> 00:53:52.863
What?

826
00:53:54.131 --> 00:53:55.199
No.

827
00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:57.402
Spill it.

828
00:54:01.972 --> 00:54:03.274
I'm a virgin.

829
00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:06.411
Never?

830
00:54:08.579 --> 00:54:10.781
All those girlfriends
and no action?

831
00:54:10.848 --> 00:54:13.784
Well, I almost did once.

832
00:54:14.719 --> 00:54:15.753
Really, when?

833
00:54:16.754 --> 00:54:17.788
Recently.

834
00:54:18.823 --> 00:54:20.024
How recently?

835
00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:21.392
Pretty recently.

836
00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:27.832
I'm going to tell you something.

837
00:54:27.898 --> 00:54:29.600
If you want to
hang out with her,

838
00:54:29.667 --> 00:54:31.201
you don't hang out here, ok?

839
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:34.772
I'll hang out here.

840
00:54:38.343 --> 00:54:39.544
Ok.

841
00:54:47.918 --> 00:54:49.286
Jane?

842
00:54:49.887 --> 00:54:51.255
Yeah?

843
00:54:51.322 --> 00:54:52.323
I'm sorry.

844
00:54:54.925 --> 00:54:56.927
I'm sorry about the kiss.

845
00:55:17.482 --> 00:55:19.717
So what do you know
about Jane and Steve?

846
00:55:19.784 --> 00:55:21.586
Can't do it. Sorry.

847
00:55:21.652 --> 00:55:22.820
Can't do what?

848
00:55:22.887 --> 00:55:24.589
Can't say.

849
00:55:24.655 --> 00:55:26.924
It's one of those upstairs
stories, partner.

850
00:55:26.991 --> 00:55:28.025
Sorry.

851
00:55:28.092 --> 00:55:29.159
But you know?

852
00:55:29.226 --> 00:55:30.361
Can't say.

853
00:55:30.428 --> 00:55:32.296
But there's something
to know, right?

854
00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:33.931
Is there?

855
00:55:35.332 --> 00:55:36.333
Damn.

856
00:56:19.043 --> 00:56:20.110
Partner?

857
00:56:21.078 --> 00:56:22.580
She's at your door.

858
00:56:32.089 --> 00:56:33.123
Hi!

859
00:56:34.425 --> 00:56:35.760
I didn't think you were home.

860
00:56:35.826 --> 00:56:36.927
I... I'm not.

861
00:56:36.994 --> 00:56:38.729
I wasn't, but I am now.

862
00:56:38.796 --> 00:56:40.465
Now I am.

863
00:56:40.531 --> 00:56:42.099
Want to go for a ride?

864
00:56:44.168 --> 00:56:45.302
In a half an hour?

865
00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:51.576
Blanche is in Texas.

866
00:56:51.642 --> 00:56:52.677
Who?

867
00:56:52.743 --> 00:56:54.612
Blanche, my mother.

868
00:56:54.679 --> 00:56:56.481
You asked me about my parents.

869
00:56:57.482 --> 00:56:58.983
She lives alone,

870
00:56:59.049 --> 00:57:02.720
drinks, dates mostly men
from the country club.

871
00:57:02.787 --> 00:57:05.289
She ran my father
off when I was three...

872
00:57:05.355 --> 00:57:07.892
Or four. Her story
always changes.

873
00:57:12.563 --> 00:57:13.731
What?

874
00:57:13.798 --> 00:57:16.567
This is the part where
you tell me about Steve.

875
00:57:16.634 --> 00:57:17.768
Is that right?

876
00:57:18.803 --> 00:57:21.238
I used to work in
this shitty little bar.

877
00:57:21.305 --> 00:57:22.807
Steve came with his band,

878
00:57:22.873 --> 00:57:26.443
like, they were playing a
stadium show, or something.

879
00:57:26.511 --> 00:57:27.945
And for the next three nights

880
00:57:28.012 --> 00:57:30.014
he sang every song for me.

881
00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:31.816
I'd never met anybody like him.

882
00:57:31.882 --> 00:57:33.518
He said all of the right things.

883
00:57:33.584 --> 00:57:35.085
He did all the right things.

884
00:57:35.152 --> 00:57:37.722
Everything was so right.

885
00:57:38.756 --> 00:57:40.591
Then he fucked it all up.

886
00:57:40.658 --> 00:57:42.326
Me especially.

887
00:57:42.392 --> 00:57:43.661
You seem ok to me.

888
00:57:45.095 --> 00:57:46.697
I used to be better than ok.

889
00:57:47.865 --> 00:57:49.967
Oh, shit! Fuck!

890
00:58:14.859 --> 00:58:17.261
Dr. Martin, cardiology.

891
00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:31.275
"New in town."

892
00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:32.442
How are you?

893
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:34.879
How do I look?

894
00:58:35.546 --> 00:58:36.881
You look great.

895
00:58:38.148 --> 00:58:39.483
How's your arm?

896
00:58:39.550 --> 00:58:41.719
Oh, I'll pull through, I think.

897
00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:43.788
Thank god.

898
00:58:45.522 --> 00:58:47.625
I'm miserable, Jones.

899
00:58:47.692 --> 00:58:49.727
That must hurt pretty bad.

900
00:58:49.794 --> 00:58:51.862
No. I'm so bored.

901
00:58:51.929 --> 00:58:54.331
Right. Maybe you should
get a record player.

902
00:58:55.499 --> 00:58:56.801
Shut up.

903
00:58:58.368 --> 00:59:00.404
You know what I want?

904
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:02.472
I want you to write me a letter.

905
00:59:03.173 --> 00:59:04.408
A letter?

906
00:59:04.474 --> 00:59:07.044
Yeah, like the ones you
write to your girlfriends.

907
00:59:07.111 --> 00:59:10.214
But just a letter letter,
not a love letter.

908
00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:12.917
I don't have any girlfriends.

909
00:59:12.983 --> 00:59:14.518
I write them to someone else.

910
00:59:14.585 --> 00:59:16.186
Well, I am someone else.

911
00:59:16.253 --> 00:59:17.421
Write one to me.

912
00:59:17.487 --> 00:59:19.323
No. I mean,

913
00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:21.726
I don't send them.

914
00:59:21.792 --> 00:59:23.427
Uh, it's complicated.

915
00:59:23.493 --> 00:59:27.297
Jones, I'm in the hospital
for Christ's sake.

916
00:59:27.364 --> 00:59:29.199
I think I deserve
at least a letter.

917
00:59:31.335 --> 00:59:32.569
I knew it. I knew it.

918
00:59:32.637 --> 00:59:33.971
I knew that something like this

919
00:59:34.038 --> 00:59:35.339
was gonna happen to you.

920
00:59:35.405 --> 00:59:37.474
No, Blanche, really, I'm fine.

921
00:59:37.541 --> 00:59:39.043
I'm going to pull through.

922
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:41.478
You see, Jones,
this is what happens.

923
00:59:41.545 --> 00:59:43.748
I tell you things
and you don't listen to me.

924
00:59:43.814 --> 00:59:45.616
You don't ever listen
to me, do you?

925
00:59:45.683 --> 00:59:46.851
Well, you don't ever tell me

926
00:59:46.917 --> 00:59:48.552
what I want to hear, do you?

927
00:59:48.619 --> 00:59:49.954
Don't you start.

928
00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:51.722
This is about you, Jones.

929
00:59:51.789 --> 00:59:53.423
This is about reality.

930
00:59:53.490 --> 00:59:55.292
Listen, I'm gonna
have to hang up now,

931
00:59:55.359 --> 00:59:56.426
I've got breakfast coming.

932
00:59:56.493 --> 00:59:57.928
There's a place
here that delivers

933
00:59:57.995 --> 00:59:59.463
bagels and belly dancers.

934
00:59:59.529 --> 01:00:00.831
It's fantastic.

935
01:00:00.898 --> 01:00:02.232
Are you drunk, Jones?

936
01:00:02.299 --> 01:00:04.034
What are you talking
about, belly dancers?

937
01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:05.135
Oh, here she is.

938
01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:06.236
Jones?

939
01:00:09.073 --> 01:00:10.540
You can set that down anywhere.

940
01:00:38.502 --> 01:00:40.738
I'm gonna sing
a love song for you, baby.

941
01:01:21.378 --> 01:01:22.679
How did he find out?

942
01:01:22.747 --> 01:01:24.448
I called him.

943
01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:26.550
You were bored and miserable,
so you called him.

944
01:01:26.616 --> 01:01:27.918
Wrong.

945
01:01:27.985 --> 01:01:29.720
I missed him and I
wanted to call him,

946
01:01:29.787 --> 01:01:31.021
so I did.

947
01:01:31.088 --> 01:01:33.657
Didn't he fuck you up,
or something?

948
01:01:33.724 --> 01:01:35.893
What's your problem, Jones?

949
01:01:37.261 --> 01:01:39.329
I thought we were friends.

950
01:01:40.597 --> 01:01:43.333
He came 2,000 miles, Jones.

951
01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:45.402
She can't help herself, Jones.

952
01:01:45.469 --> 01:01:46.871
It's a biological weakness

953
01:01:46.937 --> 01:01:49.506
for the black leather/
guitar-player type.

954
01:01:50.841 --> 01:01:53.878
I've experienced
bouts of it myself.

955
01:01:53.944 --> 01:01:55.913
It's powerful stuff.

956
01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:58.415
Well, it's... it's good, really.

957
01:02:00.084 --> 01:02:02.119
I'm happy for her.

958
01:02:02.186 --> 01:02:04.488
She seems happy, too.
She's good.

959
01:02:05.622 --> 01:02:07.191
It's great.

960
01:02:07.257 --> 01:02:08.993
Grab your hammer, partner.

961
01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:38.789
Hi, Jones.

962
01:02:38.856 --> 01:02:40.024
Hi, Lisa.

963
01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:41.425
Did you see Jane's car?

964
01:02:44.694 --> 01:02:46.463
What happened to your arm?

965
01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:48.765
Oh.

966
01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:51.802
You were with her.

967
01:02:51.869 --> 01:02:53.503
Well, I'm glad you're ok.

968
01:02:59.343 --> 01:03:00.610
What about Jane?

969
01:03:02.579 --> 01:03:03.981
She's ok.

970
01:03:04.048 --> 01:03:05.249
I'm glad.

971
01:03:05.315 --> 01:03:07.551
You know when something
like this happens,

972
01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.153
it kind of makes me wonder

973
01:03:09.219 --> 01:03:11.755
if I should tell her I'm sorry.

974
01:03:11.822 --> 01:03:14.024
Well, it was the deer's fault,
mostly.

975
01:03:25.102 --> 01:03:26.503
Is that for me?

976
01:03:31.608 --> 01:03:33.410
I write them to my father.

977
01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:35.779
I don't send them

978
01:03:35.846 --> 01:03:38.248
because I don't know
his address.

979
01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:40.450
Because I don't know
if he's alive or dead

980
01:03:40.517 --> 01:03:41.852
or anything else.

981
01:03:42.452 --> 01:03:43.520
Nothing.

982
01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:48.392
Only you.

983
01:03:50.895 --> 01:03:51.929
Ok.

984
01:03:52.930 --> 01:03:54.231
Say it.

985
01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.534
Only me.

986
01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.081
Jones?

987
01:04:13.884 --> 01:04:15.619
I'll be leaving soon.

988
01:04:17.121 --> 01:04:18.622
I know.

989
01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:21.025
I don't mean just
from the hospital.

990
01:04:23.193 --> 01:04:24.428
I know.

991
01:04:35.105 --> 01:04:36.340
Hey, guy.

992
01:04:36.406 --> 01:04:37.641
Hey, Steve.

993
01:04:40.177 --> 01:04:42.312
Ah, the, uh, famous copilot.

994
01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:43.413
Jones, right?

995
01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:44.548
Right.

996
01:04:44.614 --> 01:04:46.183
Yeah. How's the arm?

997
01:04:49.286 --> 01:04:50.787
You fucked her, didn't you?

998
01:04:51.555 --> 01:04:52.656
What?

999
01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:54.024
Lisa.

1000
01:04:55.692 --> 01:04:57.061
Oh, yeah.

1001
01:04:57.627 --> 01:04:58.762
You?

1002
01:05:00.965 --> 01:05:02.466
But it was nothing.

1003
01:05:02.532 --> 01:05:03.533
Nothing?

1004
01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.969
Yeah.

1005
01:05:05.035 --> 01:05:06.503
Jane took these pictures
of her. You know,

1006
01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:07.771
sexy stuff,

1007
01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:09.739
where she was wrapped
in these scarves, and, uh,

1008
01:05:09.806 --> 01:05:12.342
I wanted to find out
what was under there.

1009
01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:13.743
But, uh,

1010
01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:15.946
it was nothin'.

1011
01:05:16.013 --> 01:05:17.948
And I mean, Jane
took it pretty hard.

1012
01:05:18.015 --> 01:05:20.750
I mean, Jane takes
everything pretty hard.

1013
01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:28.892
What am I telling you for?

1014
01:05:28.959 --> 01:05:31.095
You don't even
have a CD player.

1015
01:05:37.234 --> 01:05:38.468
Dear dad,

1016
01:05:38.535 --> 01:05:40.370
you'll be glad to
know I'm recovering

1017
01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:41.705
from the accident,

1018
01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:43.974
and that girl I told you about,

1019
01:05:44.041 --> 01:05:46.076
she's as good as new.

1020
01:05:46.143 --> 01:05:47.844
What I can't figure out is

1021
01:05:47.911 --> 01:05:49.579
how could I have been so stupid?

1022
01:06:15.505 --> 01:06:16.506
How?

1023
01:06:17.741 --> 01:06:19.443
You're listed.

1024
01:06:19.509 --> 01:06:22.146
That Brad person downstairs.

1025
01:06:22.212 --> 01:06:24.514
He told me which
apartment, so...

1026
01:06:25.649 --> 01:06:27.084
That Brad person?

1027
01:06:27.151 --> 01:06:29.686
Yeah. You know,
he made a pass at me.

1028
01:06:29.753 --> 01:06:31.555
Wouldn't you know it?

1029
01:06:32.356 --> 01:06:34.191
You look nice, Blanche.

1030
01:06:34.258 --> 01:06:35.292
Well...

1031
01:06:36.926 --> 01:06:38.695
Then ask me to sit down.

1032
01:06:43.433 --> 01:06:47.137
Well, thank you,
Mr. Sophisticated.

1033
01:06:47.204 --> 01:06:48.205
Mmm.

1034
01:06:52.742 --> 01:06:54.344
I got a motorcycle.

1035
01:06:55.112 --> 01:06:57.447
Well, isn't that nice.

1036
01:06:57.514 --> 01:06:59.683
Maybe I should throw
myself off this roof,

1037
01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:02.419
save the trouble
of having to bury you.

1038
01:07:02.486 --> 01:07:04.254
I don't think the fall
would kill you,

1039
01:07:04.321 --> 01:07:05.455
but you could try it.

1040
01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:09.059
Tell me about this Jane person.

1041
01:07:09.126 --> 01:07:11.661
Skip the part about her
being a lousy driver though.

1042
01:07:12.596 --> 01:07:14.064
I don't know.

1043
01:07:15.999 --> 01:07:17.634
She's a lot like you, actually.

1044
01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:18.968
That's exactly what happens.

1045
01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:21.571
Boys always chase after girls

1046
01:07:21.638 --> 01:07:23.673
that remind them
of their mothers.

1047
01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:26.443
She drinks,
she's rude, she's loud.

1048
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:28.378
Yeah, ok. Shut up,
will you?

1049
01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:31.748
Is she pretty?

1050
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:34.451
She's beautiful.

1051
01:07:41.825 --> 01:07:43.327
What about you, Blanche?

1052
01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:46.596
Are you making anyone
miserable on a regular basis?

1053
01:07:46.663 --> 01:07:48.165
Well, if that's you're cute way

1054
01:07:48.232 --> 01:07:50.600
of asking if I'm in
love with anybody,

1055
01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:52.236
the answer is no.

1056
01:07:53.703 --> 01:07:55.139
Come on, Blanche.

1057
01:07:55.205 --> 01:07:56.906
Well, sure, there might be times

1058
01:07:56.973 --> 01:07:59.476
when I'm sweet on a man.

1059
01:07:59.543 --> 01:08:00.910
I like to feel good

1060
01:08:00.977 --> 01:08:02.579
as much as the next girl.

1061
01:08:02.646 --> 01:08:05.482
But don't confuse feeling good

1062
01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:07.584
with being in love, Jones.

1063
01:08:07.651 --> 01:08:09.653
Now those two roads,

1064
01:08:09.719 --> 01:08:11.288
they rarely cross.

1065
01:08:11.355 --> 01:08:13.056
Rarely or never?

1066
01:08:17.261 --> 01:08:19.396
Why are you still
dragging around

1067
01:08:19.463 --> 01:08:20.897
that beat-up trunk?

1068
01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:23.667
That's all I have,

1069
01:08:23.733 --> 01:08:25.535
that and this typewriter.

1070
01:08:28.071 --> 01:08:29.539
Well, why don't you see

1071
01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:31.875
if you've got a blanket
in there for me?

1072
01:08:34.511 --> 01:08:35.945
I guess it's getting late.

1073
01:08:37.847 --> 01:08:39.249
We'll talk tomorrow.

1074
01:08:40.184 --> 01:08:41.551
Ok.

1075
01:08:42.752 --> 01:08:44.321

Jones, watch the road!

1105
01:11:31.455 --> 01:11:33.122
It's beautiful.

1106
01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:35.091
You guys are unbelievable.

1107
01:11:35.158 --> 01:11:37.160
Well, all I did was beat on it.

1108
01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:43.900
How would you like to drive it?

1109
01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:46.370
Around the block
or 2,000 miles one way?

1110
01:11:50.674 --> 01:11:51.708
Ok.

1111
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:55.078
I'll do it.

1112
01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:58.247
Why would you do it?

1113
01:11:59.215 --> 01:12:00.717
We're friends, right?

1114
01:12:02.285 --> 01:12:04.087
Yeah, we're friends.

1115
01:12:31.481 --> 01:12:34.217
Poor guy, he's crying.

1116
01:12:35.118 --> 01:12:37.587
Crying, wow.

1117
01:12:37.654 --> 01:12:40.289
I'll only be gone
for a couple of days.

1118
01:12:41.858 --> 01:12:43.627
Shut up, Jones, and drive.

1119
01:12:44.428 --> 01:12:45.429
Right.

1120
01:13:05.348 --> 01:13:08.552
"I'm sorry, Jones.
I don't have any answers.

1121
01:13:08.618 --> 01:13:10.253
"Not many, anyway.

1122
01:13:10.319 --> 01:13:12.956
"And probably none that
would make you very happy.

1123
01:13:14.824 --> 01:13:17.360
"No one ever looked at me
the way your father did.

1124
01:13:17.427 --> 01:13:20.530
He didn't see a pretty girl
with a rich daddy."

1125
01:13:20.597 --> 01:13:23.366
He saw someone
with hopes and dreams

1126
01:13:23.433 --> 01:13:24.834
of her own,

1127
01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:27.571
and I would have
followed him anywhere.

1128
01:13:27.637 --> 01:13:29.305
Well, we only got as far as

1129
01:13:29.372 --> 01:13:31.875
a little cabin in a motor court.

1130
01:13:31.941 --> 01:13:34.678
I made eggs and toast
in the kitchen,

1131
01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:38.848
and we laughed, made love,
and drank whiskey.

1132
01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:41.084
And I wasn't more
than fifty miles from home,

1133
01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:43.386
but it felt like 5,000.

1134
01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.490
And those two little rooms,

1135
01:13:46.556 --> 01:13:49.959
they felt like
the whole wide world to me.

1136
01:13:50.026 --> 01:13:51.394
But for him,

1137
01:13:51.461 --> 01:13:53.730
I think it was just another dot

1138
01:13:53.797 --> 01:13:55.532
on another map.

1139
01:13:55.599 --> 01:13:58.034
I'm sorry, Jones.

1140
01:13:58.101 --> 01:14:01.037
I know I told you
a lot of pretty things

1141
01:14:01.104 --> 01:14:02.371
about your father,

1142
01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:04.974
things I wanted to believe, too,

1143
01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:06.209
but the truth is

1144
01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:08.945
you never met your daddy.

1145
01:14:09.012 --> 01:14:11.047
One day he went out
for cigarettes

1146
01:14:11.114 --> 01:14:13.049
and he never came back.

1147
01:14:23.426 --> 01:14:25.529
These letters of yours
are hilarious.

1148
01:14:25.595 --> 01:14:27.931
I wish you'd let me
show this one to Steve,

1149
01:14:27.997 --> 01:14:31.000
where I'm tied up in the trunk
and you come to my rescue.

1150
01:14:32.736 --> 01:14:34.437
I know what he did.

1151
01:14:35.639 --> 01:14:36.773
What who did?

1152
01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:37.907
Steve.

1153
01:14:37.974 --> 01:14:39.676
I know what he did.

1154
01:14:49.619 --> 01:14:50.620
Oh.

1155
01:14:51.688 --> 01:14:53.389
Jesus!

1156
01:14:53.456 --> 01:14:55.692
Are you trying to get me drunk?

1157
01:15:05.034 --> 01:15:07.804
I tried to pretend
it didn't happen,

1158
01:15:07.871 --> 01:15:09.639
that I didn't know,

1159
01:15:09.706 --> 01:15:12.141
that I couldn't see it
in his face.

1160
01:15:12.742 --> 01:15:14.010
But why?

1161
01:15:14.077 --> 01:15:15.411
Why pretend?

1162
01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.548
Because I didn't want to go back

1163
01:15:18.615 --> 01:15:21.384
to the way it was before.

1164
01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:23.920
With Steve,
there's no yesterday,

1165
01:15:23.987 --> 01:15:26.155
no tomorrow, just now.

1166
01:15:26.222 --> 01:15:28.124
Always and forever, now.

1167
01:15:29.325 --> 01:15:30.827
For the first time in my life,

1168
01:15:30.894 --> 01:15:33.362
I knew what it felt like
to be free.

1169
01:15:33.429 --> 01:15:35.732
Let me try.

1170
01:15:35.799 --> 01:15:38.501
I could do it, Jane.
I could rescue you.

1171
01:15:38.568 --> 01:15:40.436
You are so nice.

1172
01:15:40.503 --> 01:15:43.239
I could fuck Lisa if nice
is a problem for you.

1173
01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:48.812
We're too much alike.

1174
01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:51.047
I could see it
in the photos I took.

1175
01:15:53.049 --> 01:15:54.684
I can see it now.

1176
01:16:06.195 --> 01:16:07.997
Are you afraid of the dark?

1177
01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:10.066
I thought you'd want it.

1178
01:16:10.133 --> 01:16:11.835
You can switch it off.

1179
01:16:53.009 --> 01:16:54.277
Jones,

1180
01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.346
this is not happening.

1181
01:17:00.416 --> 01:17:01.617
Say it.

1182
01:17:02.919 --> 01:17:04.988

I've been some places.

1198
01:18:26.836 --> 01:18:29.172
Texas, Delaware,

1199
01:18:30.106 --> 01:18:32.608
three schools in New Hampshire,

1200
01:18:32.675 --> 01:18:34.677
Kansas,

1201
01:18:34.744 --> 01:18:36.913
not everywhere,
so maybe I'm wrong.

1202
01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:42.085
But I think you're probably the
most beautiful woman in the world.

1203
01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:44.854
What did you say?

1204
01:18:46.089 --> 01:18:47.356
Nothing.

1205
01:18:50.626 --> 01:18:52.261
You said something.

1206
01:18:54.363 --> 01:18:56.032
I said, we're here.

1207
01:19:09.512 --> 01:19:11.314
Hey, guy!

1208
01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:14.217
I can't believe this piece
of crap actually made it.

1209
01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:23.059
You can't do this.

1210
01:19:23.126 --> 01:19:24.260
Don't.

1211
01:19:24.327 --> 01:19:25.628
What's that?

1212
01:19:26.662 --> 01:19:28.164
That stays.

1213
01:19:29.365 --> 01:19:30.566
Oh, right,

1214
01:19:30.633 --> 01:19:33.236
the top secret funny stuff.
What was I thinking?

1215
01:19:34.103 --> 01:19:35.638
Last night did happen.

1216
01:19:35.704 --> 01:19:37.540
Please, Jones.

1217
01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:39.342
What happened last night?

1218
01:19:39.408 --> 01:19:40.543
Nothing.

1219
01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:42.178
Nothing happened last night.

1220
01:19:42.245 --> 01:19:43.712
Yes, it did,
and it wasn't nothing.

1221
01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:44.780
It was something.

1222
01:19:44.848 --> 01:19:46.149
Stop it.

1223
01:19:46.215 --> 01:19:47.350
Is this something
I should know about?

1224
01:19:47.416 --> 01:19:48.551
No.
Yes.

1225
01:19:49.652 --> 01:19:50.854
It is.

1226
01:19:51.687 --> 01:19:53.356
In your dreams, kid.

1227
01:19:55.959 --> 01:19:57.961
What are you doing, Jones?

1228
01:19:59.128 --> 01:20:01.130
Steve, stop it!

1229
01:20:02.565 --> 01:20:03.799
Stop it!

1230
01:20:05.601 --> 01:20:08.571
Get in the car, Jones.
I want to talk to you.

1231
01:20:14.543 --> 01:20:15.879
Why did you do that?

1232
01:20:15.945 --> 01:20:17.213
Jane, what are you doing?

1233
01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.614
Come on, open up!

1234
01:20:18.681 --> 01:20:20.249
You're better than this, Jane.

1235
01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:21.417
You're better than ok.

1236
01:20:21.484 --> 01:20:22.818
Come on, open the goddamn car!

1237
01:20:22.886 --> 01:20:23.987
Give me a minute.

1238
01:20:24.053 --> 01:20:25.488
Give me a minute!

1239
01:20:26.422 --> 01:20:27.823
Last night was now, wasn't it?

1240
01:20:27.891 --> 01:20:29.792
There was no yesterday,
no tomorrow,

1241
01:20:29.859 --> 01:20:31.260
and it still is now.

1242
01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:32.528
It's not too late.

1243
01:20:32.595 --> 01:20:34.898
Jones, it is tomorrow.

1244
01:20:34.964 --> 01:20:37.500
I'm here.
I... I cannot go back.

1245
01:20:37.566 --> 01:20:38.567
Jane...

1246
01:20:41.737 --> 01:20:43.206
Does it hurt?

1247
01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:48.777
I want you to take the car.

1248
01:20:49.645 --> 01:20:51.314
I don't want the car.

1249
01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:52.548
Take it anyways.

1250
01:20:52.615 --> 01:20:55.251
You fixed her.
You put her back together.

1251
01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:21.377
Close your eyes

1252
01:21:21.444 --> 01:21:23.146
Maggie Cassidy

1253
01:21:27.083 --> 01:21:30.353
and take your leave of me

1254
01:21:31.754 --> 01:21:34.057
oh, shit!
Somebody called the cops!

1255
01:21:34.123 --> 01:21:35.925
Let's get the hell out of here.

1256
01:21:35.992 --> 01:21:37.260
Let's go, man!

1257
01:21:37.326 --> 01:21:38.694
That I thought I'd be

1258
01:21:38.761 --> 01:21:41.364
piece of shit car!

1259
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:43.299
Let's go.
Let's go!

1260
01:21:47.170 --> 01:21:48.237
Mmm.

1261
01:21:51.107 --> 01:21:52.375
Hello?

1262
01:21:52.441 --> 01:21:54.978
It was me, wasn't it, Blanche?

1263
01:21:56.045 --> 01:21:57.780
Jones?

1264
01:21:57.846 --> 01:21:59.448
All of these years,
I blamed you.

1265
01:21:59.515 --> 01:22:00.950
I thought it was your fault,

1266
01:22:01.017 --> 01:22:03.486
but it was me, always me.

1267
01:22:03.552 --> 01:22:05.421
Jones, where are you?

1268
01:22:05.488 --> 01:22:07.590
Why didn't you tell me
the truth about why he left?

1269
01:22:07.656 --> 01:22:09.492
That he left
because you got pregnant?

1270
01:22:09.558 --> 01:22:11.094
Because, uh...

1271
01:22:12.895 --> 01:22:14.497
Oh, honey.

1272
01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:21.104
Because I didn't want you
to feel the way I did.

1273
01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:23.839
I thought I could at least
do that for you.

1274
01:22:23.906 --> 01:22:26.642
So you could send
me away to school

1275
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:27.810
and every summer.

1276
01:22:27.876 --> 01:22:30.413
No, that was
your granddaddy's doing.

1277
01:22:32.048 --> 01:22:33.816
He said that I'd...

1278
01:22:33.882 --> 01:22:35.951
I'd never make for
any kind of a mother

1279
01:22:36.019 --> 01:22:38.621
and I should just
take care of it.

1280
01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:40.589
You were my chance, Jones.

1281
01:22:40.656 --> 01:22:42.525
That he might come back.

1282
01:22:42.591 --> 01:22:44.727
I was your chance
that he'd come back.

1283
01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:47.863
No. I knew
he wasn't coming back.

1284
01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:50.333
You can't stop
some people, Jones.

1285
01:22:51.767 --> 01:22:54.703
They come into your life
destined to leave it.

1286
01:22:55.938 --> 01:22:58.874
You can wrap your
arms tight around them,

1287
01:22:58.941 --> 01:23:00.576
but the best
that you can hope to do

1288
01:23:00.643 --> 01:23:03.379
is just slow 'em down a little,

1289
01:23:03.446 --> 01:23:06.549
because there's
no holding on tight enough.

1290
01:23:09.685 --> 01:23:11.754
But you were mine.

1291
01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:14.723
You were my chance
and I blew it.

1292
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:16.125
Blanche.

1293
01:23:17.293 --> 01:23:18.294
No.

1294
01:23:20.063 --> 01:23:21.764
You didn't blow it, Blanche.

1295
01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.601
Jones!

1296
01:23:59.302 --> 01:24:00.903
Guess what?

1297
01:24:00.969 --> 01:24:02.771
You're moving out.

1298
01:24:02.838 --> 01:24:05.308
Guess why I'm moving out.

1299
01:24:05.374 --> 01:24:06.575
You got a part.

1300
01:24:06.642 --> 01:24:07.710
Yes!

1301
01:24:07.776 --> 01:24:10.246
It's a musical revue
on a cruise ship,

1302
01:24:10.313 --> 01:24:12.181
so my stuff is
going into storage,

1303
01:24:12.248 --> 01:24:14.650
and I'm going to sea!

1304
01:24:14.717 --> 01:24:16.152
What happened to your eye?

1305
01:24:16.219 --> 01:24:18.587
Oh, it's nothing.
Congratulations, Lisa.

1306
01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:21.457
I left you something.

1307
01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:28.864
It's gonna be
worth something someday.

1308
01:24:28.931 --> 01:24:31.434
You want me
to autograph it for you?

1309
01:24:32.135 --> 01:24:34.036
