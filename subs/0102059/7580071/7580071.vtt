(Soldier yelling orders)

5
00:01:06.106 --> 00:01:07.149
Yes, sir!

6
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.984
-Sorry.
-Oops.

7
00:01:26.043 --> 00:01:27.753
(Sizzling)

8
00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:37.179
Hike!

9
00:01:37.721 --> 00:01:39.264
-Catch!
-No!

10
00:02:00.577 --> 00:02:02.287
Stand clear, stand clear!

11
00:02:05.624 --> 00:02:06.708

12
00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:08.502

13
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.776
(Geese quacking)

14
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.903
Goose 1: Oh, boy.

15
00:02:34.987 --> 00:02:36.238
Goose 2: Look out!

16

Geese 3: Whoa!

Goose 5: Why, I oughta--!

19
00:02:40.784 --> 00:02:42.411
Yee-ha!

20
00:02:46.498 --> 00:02:48.667
All right, buzz, that's enough of that.

21
00:02:53.213 --> 00:02:55.215
What did I just say?

22
00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.509
That is a good way
to lose an eye, my friend.

23
00:02:58.343 --> 00:02:59.386
Hold it.

24
00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:01.221
We've got company at 2:00.

25
00:03:01.305 --> 00:03:02.931
I got him, mailman.
Hang on.

26
00:03:03.015 --> 00:03:05.350
-(Jets surge)
-Here we go!

27
00:03:08.145 --> 00:03:10.230
Buzz, what is going on up there?

28
00:03:10.314 --> 00:03:11.648
Just moving a road hog.

29
00:03:12.816 --> 00:03:14.735
(Car horn honks)

30
00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.446
Knock it off! What kind of stunt was that?

31
00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:19.239
Just seeing what this baby can do.

32
00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:23.869
This bag of bones isn't rated past mach-2.

33
00:03:25.537 --> 00:03:26.580
Mach-1.

34
00:03:27.164 --> 00:03:29.124
The g-forces, buzz.
The g-forces!

35
00:03:29.374 --> 00:03:30.417
Mach-2.

36
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.793
Got to push the envelope.

37
00:03:33.253 --> 00:03:35.547
Mach-3!

38
00:03:35.631 --> 00:03:37.758
Buzz, we're tearing apart!

39
00:03:40.594 --> 00:03:42.429
I'm losing control. Eject, mailman.

40
00:03:42.763 --> 00:03:44.473
Hit the silk!

41
00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:47.267
I can't get out!

42
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:48.977
What are you doing?

43
00:03:49.102 --> 00:03:51.521
Buzz, get back here!

44
00:03:52.022 --> 00:03:53.732
Okay, I've been in
tougher scrapes than this.

45
00:03:54.316 --> 00:03:56.151
Trees. There's the ground.
It looks hard.

46
00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:58.987
Okay. Trees...Trees.
Ooh! Ow! Oh!

47
00:03:59.071 --> 00:04:00.864
That's mahogany!
Ow! Ow! Squirrels' nest.

48
00:04:00.948 --> 00:04:02.074
That's fir! Ow!

49
00:04:02.157 --> 00:04:03.533
Ow! Pine!
Oh! The ground!

50
00:04:03.617 --> 00:04:08.080
Ohh...oh...oh...

51
00:04:08.622 --> 00:04:09.665
I made it.

52
00:04:09.748 --> 00:04:11.500
I made it.

53
00:04:11.583 --> 00:04:13.627
There is a god.

54
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.587
Hallelujah!

55
00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:17.130
Ow! Oh! Ouch!

56
00:04:17.214 --> 00:04:18.548
Owie! Ow! Oh!

57
00:04:18.632 --> 00:04:19.841
Ouch! Ow!

58
00:04:24.096 --> 00:04:25.555
Ohh, you're French, aren't you?

59
00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.016
Yeah, ohh, just like that.

60
00:04:41.822 --> 00:04:42.906
(Bell tolls)

61
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.951
(Noon whistle blows)

62
00:04:48.078 --> 00:04:49.288
Hunter: Hey, look! There's one!

63
00:04:49.371 --> 00:04:50.455
Uh-oh.

64
00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:51.581

65
00:05:22.446 --> 00:05:25.032

00:05:25.115 --> 00:05:29.953
(Urinating)

67
00:05:32.706 --> 00:05:35.292
(Multiple locks unbolt)

68
00:05:42.632 --> 00:05:43.717
Topper Harley?

69
00:05:45.135 --> 00:05:47.054
Once, perhaps.

70
00:05:47.137 --> 00:05:49.139
Now I am called tukachinchilla.

71
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:50.974
What does it mean?

72
00:05:51.058 --> 00:05:52.601
Fluffy bunny feet.

73
00:05:55.562 --> 00:05:57.105
It's very nice.

74
00:05:57.564 --> 00:05:58.982
I'm lieutenant commander James block.

75
00:05:59.775 --> 00:06:01.026
I knew your father buzz.

76
00:06:02.986 --> 00:06:05.530
Until his incident, he was
the greatest pilot who ever lived.

77
00:06:08.742 --> 00:06:10.494
We need to talk.

78
00:06:23.215 --> 00:06:24.500
-The Navy wants--
-(Dog barking)

79
00:06:32.307 --> 00:06:33.642
The Navy wants you back, Harley.

80
00:06:34.518 --> 00:06:36.019
They threw me out.

81
00:06:36.353 --> 00:06:38.730
Why should I go back?

82
00:06:38.814 --> 00:06:42.192
I came here to get away
from the Navy, away from flying.

83
00:06:56.623 --> 00:06:57.707
(High-pitched voice)
The Navy is embarking

84
00:06:57.791 --> 00:06:59.835
on a top-secret mission
code-named "sleepy weasel."

85
00:07:00.043 --> 00:07:01.878
I'm giving you a second chance,

86
00:07:01.962 --> 00:07:03.547
something your father never had.

87
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.507
You're the best of the best, topper.

88
00:07:08.176 --> 00:07:10.220
(High-pitched voice)
Leave me to speak with the old one.

89
00:07:10.303 --> 00:07:12.431
He is wise in the ways of such things.

90
00:07:17.561 --> 00:07:19.729
The Navy really needs you.

91
00:07:19.813 --> 00:07:21.022
Great helium.

92
00:07:23.191 --> 00:07:24.609
(Chuckles) Whew...

93
00:07:25.318 --> 00:07:26.570
Owatonna...

94
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.532
Owatonna.

95
00:07:32.242 --> 00:07:33.577
("Can't touch this"
plays on walkman)

97
00:07:37.414 --> 00:07:40.750

Admiral, it's good to see you again, sir.

147
00:10:38.219 --> 00:10:39.220
It's been too long.

148
00:10:39.304 --> 00:10:40.347
So it has. Yes, yes.

149
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.390
-How are you, sir?
-Hawaii?

150
00:10:42.724 --> 00:10:44.059
I'm in Hawaii? Goddamn it, bill.

151
00:10:44.142 --> 00:10:45.268
I'm supposed to be in California.

152
00:10:45.352 --> 00:10:46.811
No no sir, this is California.

153
00:10:46.895 --> 00:10:48.188
Well, gotta run. Good luck.

154
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:51.024
But, sir, this is your command.

155
00:10:51.566 --> 00:10:53.777
Sleepy weasel has been on
the drawing board for 10 months.

156
00:10:54.611 --> 00:10:55.779
The president hand-picked you.

157
00:10:55.862 --> 00:10:58.114
He damn right he did.
No stopping US now, eh, Ted?

158
00:10:58.573 --> 00:11:00.700
Why don't I show you your offices
and I can bring you up to date.

159
00:11:00.784 --> 00:11:02.410
You've always been a fine soldier, Scott.

160
00:11:02.494 --> 00:11:03.620
Just lead the way.

161
00:11:04.454 --> 00:11:05.705
Oh, good god, I got to pee.

162
00:11:06.414 --> 00:11:09.000
I had better part of my bladder
blown off in guadalcanal.

163

-Oof!
-Watch your step, sir.

00:11:32.315 --> 00:11:33.441
♫ here's the story ♫

178
00:11:33.525 --> 00:11:34.609
♫ of a man named Brady ♫♫

179
00:11:44.452 --> 00:11:46.037
Gentlemen, he's back.

180
00:11:46.121 --> 00:11:48.331
Men: Hey, topper! Topper.

181
00:11:48.415 --> 00:11:50.041
How you been?

182
00:11:50.125 --> 00:11:51.376
All right. All right.

183
00:11:51.459 --> 00:11:53.044
Jazz, the big guy.

184
00:11:54.379 --> 00:11:55.714
Scooter, how you doing?

185
00:11:55.797 --> 00:11:57.132
Topper, my main man.

186
00:11:58.383 --> 00:12:00.093
Rabbi, mazel tov.

187
00:12:00.176 --> 00:12:01.511
You should live and be well!

188
00:12:01.594 --> 00:12:04.139
(Glass shatters)

189
00:12:19.446 --> 00:12:20.572
Hey, buddy...

190
00:12:21.239 --> 00:12:24.284
You okay? You don't look so hot.

191
00:12:24.367 --> 00:12:25.493
You need some help?

192
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.036
I'm okay.

193
00:12:29.122 --> 00:12:30.874
You're topper Harley, aren't you?

194
00:12:31.166 --> 00:12:33.293
I hear you've got chops
the rest of US only dream of.

195
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:34.878
Throwing you out was a bum rap.

196
00:12:35.503 --> 00:12:36.671
I'm Jim pfaffenbach.

197
00:12:37.255 --> 00:12:38.506
Everybody calls me wash out.

198
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.885
You're a pilot?

199
00:12:41.968 --> 00:12:43.845
Oh, yeah. I'm going to be flying with you.

200
00:12:45.221 --> 00:12:46.306
Good.

201
00:12:48.183 --> 00:12:49.225
Phew!

202
00:12:52.353 --> 00:12:54.314
(Whistle)

203
00:12:54.397 --> 00:12:56.399
Cute.

204
00:12:56.483 --> 00:12:59.402
I like to stay in shape. Thanks.

205
00:12:59.486 --> 00:13:00.820
These all at home?

206
00:13:00.904 --> 00:13:04.449
Yeah. The dogs, wife, and kids.

207
00:13:05.992 --> 00:13:07.786
You got pictures of your family?
I'd love to see 'em.

208
00:13:09.162 --> 00:13:10.330
I am my family photo.

209
00:13:11.289 --> 00:13:13.458
But everybody needs a family to love.

210
00:13:14.209 --> 00:13:17.045
I could never find time for love.
It's too heavy.

211
00:13:17.128 --> 00:13:18.588
It's an anchor that drowns a man.

212
00:13:19.172 --> 00:13:21.633
Besides, I got the sky,
the smell of jet exhaust,

213
00:13:21.716 --> 00:13:23.718
-my bike.
-A loner.

214
00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:25.428
No. I own it.

215
00:13:26.638 --> 00:13:28.556
I can see I'm going
to have to work on you.

216
00:13:29.349 --> 00:13:31.559
Name's Pete Thompson, but, uh...

217
00:13:33.353 --> 00:13:35.688
Everybody calls me dead meat.

218
00:13:35.772 --> 00:13:36.815
Topper Harley.

219
00:13:36.898 --> 00:13:38.316
Just a pleasure.

220
00:13:42.862 --> 00:13:43.905
(Door closes)

221
00:13:43.988 --> 00:13:45.031
Attention on deck!

222
00:13:45.114 --> 00:13:46.115
Ten-hut!

223
00:13:46.199 --> 00:13:48.117
Good morning, sir!

224
00:13:49.661 --> 00:13:52.372
I don't care how many missions
you've flown!

225
00:13:52.455 --> 00:13:55.333
I don't care how good you think you are!

226
00:13:55.416 --> 00:13:56.501
You're nobody!

227
00:13:56.584 --> 00:13:58.169
And for the next 10 days,

228
00:13:58.253 --> 00:14:01.297
nobody takes a crap
unless I say so! Got it?

229
00:14:01.381 --> 00:14:03.007
Yes, sir!

230
00:14:04.592 --> 00:14:06.302
I said attention.

231
00:14:06.845 --> 00:14:08.304
Now didn't I make myself clear,

232
00:14:08.388 --> 00:14:10.348
or don't you take orders?

233
00:14:10.431 --> 00:14:12.851
When I say attention, I mean attention!

234
00:14:12.934 --> 00:14:14.519
-Yes, sir!
-Now!

235
00:14:14.602 --> 00:14:16.145
(Spring boings)

236
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:23.695
You eyeballing me, mister?

237
00:14:23.778 --> 00:14:25.446
No, sir!

238
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:28.741
When the next time I see that ugly face of yours,
I want it clean-shaven!

239
00:14:28.825 --> 00:14:30.326
Suck in that chest.

240
00:14:34.497 --> 00:14:35.623
Pfaffenbach!

241
00:14:38.668 --> 00:14:40.044
Who you looking at, boy?

242
00:14:40.128 --> 00:14:41.129
No one, sir!

243
00:14:42.088 --> 00:14:43.423
Oh, I'm some unworthy lowlife

244
00:14:43.506 --> 00:14:45.425
that's not good enough for you to talk to?

245
00:14:45.508 --> 00:14:47.343
That attitude is short on collateral!

246
00:14:47.427 --> 00:14:50.013
This lowlife is god
as far as you're concerned!

247
00:14:50.096 --> 00:14:51.639
Hey, lighten up.

248
00:14:53.099 --> 00:14:54.642
Cut the kid some slack.

249
00:14:56.394 --> 00:14:59.105
Who the hell are you talking to, son?

250
00:14:59.606 --> 00:15:02.275
Your ego's writing checks
your body can't cash.

251
00:15:02.358 --> 00:15:04.736
You got five minutes to stow your gear.

252
00:15:05.069 --> 00:15:06.096
Get moving!

253
00:15:09.365 --> 00:15:12.201
Yeah, I'm sure deep down he means well.

254
00:15:14.621 --> 00:15:16.372
I hope you were paying attention.

255
00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.124
I don't think we've met.

256
00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:19.876
Kent Gregory.

257
00:15:20.627 --> 00:15:21.669
Excuse me if I don't shake the hand

258
00:15:21.753 --> 00:15:23.379
of some hot shot whose father
caused the death

259
00:15:23.463 --> 00:15:25.173
of someone very special to me--

260
00:15:25.632 --> 00:15:27.592
dominic "mailman" farnham.

261
00:15:27.717 --> 00:15:28.801
You mean...

262
00:15:28.885 --> 00:15:31.471
Yes. Dominic farnham was my father.

263
00:15:31.554 --> 00:15:32.847
I was his love child.

264
00:15:33.598 --> 00:15:34.974
It was a hunting accident.

265
00:15:35.391 --> 00:15:36.643
Accident, my deep blue eyes.

266
00:15:36.726 --> 00:15:38.770
It was reckless, irresponsible flying,
and you know it.

267
00:15:40.188 --> 00:15:41.189
You okay?

268
00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.275
This is an incredible coincidence.

269
00:15:44.901 --> 00:15:47.153
But the hunter who mistakenly
killed your father...

270
00:15:51.908 --> 00:15:55.203
Was Henry pfaffenbach, my father.

271
00:15:56.955 --> 00:15:59.040
I feel terrible.

272
00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:01.876
Isn't this Henry alva pfaffenbach?

273
00:16:02.794 --> 00:16:04.963
My mother was a pfaffenbach.

274
00:16:05.046 --> 00:16:07.632
Not...doreen pfaffenbach,

275
00:16:08.007 --> 00:16:09.175
from Minnesota?

276
00:16:09.258 --> 00:16:10.301
Yeah.

277
00:16:10.635 --> 00:16:11.928
Then we're cousins.

278
00:16:12.011 --> 00:16:14.305
We used to spend our summers
in eagle river.

279
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:16.391
-Eagle river?
-Eagle river?

280
00:16:16.474 --> 00:16:19.185
I hope you can forgive me for this.

281
00:16:20.561 --> 00:16:22.855
If it helps, I didn't have seconds.

282
00:16:24.065 --> 00:16:26.025
That's all right.
It's not your fault.

283
00:16:26.943 --> 00:16:27.944
Anyone could've made that mistake.

284
00:16:28.027 --> 00:16:29.028
(Picture shatters)

285
00:16:29.112 --> 00:16:31.614
But him... he's the type of guy

286
00:16:31.698 --> 00:16:33.700
that could end up killing
every man in this outfit.

287
00:16:33.783 --> 00:16:35.952
Wait a minute.
Why are you mad at me?

288
00:16:36.327 --> 00:16:37.996
He's the one who ate your father.

289
00:16:39.414 --> 00:16:41.124
Like father, like son.

290
00:16:41.207 --> 00:16:42.709
You've already been tossed out once.

291
00:16:43.334 --> 00:16:44.794
Hold it. Hold it.

292
00:16:45.628 --> 00:16:47.255
We can't fight among ourselves.

293
00:16:47.964 --> 00:16:49.632
We're all on the same team here.

294
00:16:49.799 --> 00:16:52.176
I want the two of you to shake hands.

295
00:16:53.928 --> 00:16:56.723
(Sizzling)

296
00:16:56.806 --> 00:16:59.767
There, now. Isn't that better?

297
00:17:00.101 --> 00:17:01.769
-Yeah.
-Sure.

298
00:17:04.355 --> 00:17:06.649
There. We're friends again.

299
00:17:07.316 --> 00:17:10.111
Here. Have some of my lucky gum.

300
00:17:10.862 --> 00:17:13.573
Look, dead meat, we fly together,

301
00:17:13.656 --> 00:17:15.366
we sleep next to each other,
but that's all.

302
00:17:15.825 --> 00:17:16.826
Don't get too close.

303
00:17:17.035 --> 00:17:18.870
Let me handle my own affairs.

304
00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.625
He's so complex.

305
00:17:27.003 --> 00:17:30.173
Every aerial photo and recon report
indicates a defensive arsenal

306
00:17:30.256 --> 00:17:32.341
in the the "d" and perhaps
negative "c" categories.

307
00:17:32.425 --> 00:17:34.844
There's also a nest
of anti-aircraft squadrons.

308
00:17:34.927 --> 00:17:36.929
They can send up an ack-ack umbrella

309
00:17:37.013 --> 00:17:39.307
high enough to make
any attack ineffective.

310
00:17:39.557 --> 00:17:42.310
I don't have a clue what you're
talking about Phil, not a fucking clue.

311
00:17:42.727 --> 00:17:45.063
I have a shell the size
of a fist in my head.

312
00:17:45.146 --> 00:17:46.439
Porkchop hill.

313
00:17:46.814 --> 00:17:48.816
The only way I can get
this goddam toupee to stay on

314
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:52.153
is by magnetizing the entire
upper-left quadrant of my skull so,

315
00:17:52.487 --> 00:17:53.905
you just go ahead and do what you do.

316
00:17:53.988 --> 00:17:55.865
Do you have any soup?

317
00:17:55.948 --> 00:17:59.202
Of course sir, I'll have the mess
bring something right up.

318
00:17:59.285 --> 00:18:02.038
I love soup.
I mean, I think I love soup.

319
00:18:02.121 --> 00:18:04.332
Son of a bitchin' shell,
it's either soup or duck.

320
00:18:04.707 --> 00:18:05.708
Which one do you shoot?

321
00:18:06.084 --> 00:18:07.168
Duck, sir.

322
00:18:07.502 --> 00:18:08.586
(Clang)

323
00:18:09.003 --> 00:18:10.213
Are you all right, sir?

324
00:18:10.713 --> 00:18:11.798
Of course, I'm alright.

325
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:13.549
Why? What have you heard?

326
00:18:14.967 --> 00:18:15.968
Nothing, sir.

327
00:18:16.761 --> 00:18:18.930
Yeah, send some soup up
for the admiral on the double.

328
00:18:19.013 --> 00:18:22.809
Oh, let's go over this slippery weevil
one more time.

329
00:18:22.892 --> 00:18:25.728
I want to familiarize myself
with it as much as I possibly can.

330
00:18:25.812 --> 00:18:27.814
So, give it to me, Ben.

331
00:18:28.272 --> 00:18:29.649
Every word, every detail.

332
00:18:30.525 --> 00:18:31.859
Dot every comma.

333
00:18:32.985 --> 00:18:36.405
(Clinic chatter)

334
00:18:38.908 --> 00:18:43.204
<i>Dr. Hansen, line 182, please.</i>
<i>Dr. Hansen, line 182.</i>

335
00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:15.695
Those are some long legs.

336
00:19:16.237 --> 00:19:17.822
I just had them lengthened.

337
00:19:18.573 --> 00:19:20.032
Now they go all the way up.

338
00:19:20.658 --> 00:19:22.952
Wow. It's nice to see you again.

339
00:19:24.203 --> 00:19:25.746
I was really impressed,
the way you handled that stallion.

340
00:19:26.581 --> 00:19:28.958
You know when I saw you dig
your heels into his sides,

341
00:19:29.667 --> 00:19:31.502
tighten up the reins,
and break his spirit,

342
00:19:31.586 --> 00:19:33.504
I never wanted to be a horse
so much in my life.

343
00:19:34.422 --> 00:19:36.048
Maybe after I finish off this shrink,

344
00:19:36.132 --> 00:19:38.301
we can head out for a quick
canter in the Meadow.

345
00:19:38.759 --> 00:19:40.386
Lieutenant, I am the shrink.

346
00:19:41.637 --> 00:19:43.347
You're the psychiatrist?

347
00:19:43.431 --> 00:19:45.349
That's what the diploma says.

348
00:19:45.433 --> 00:19:48.477
I've never been to a psychiatrist before.
You will be gentle?

349
00:19:48.561 --> 00:19:50.229
(Dog yaps)

350
00:19:52.231 --> 00:19:54.567
Lieutenant Harley, I've been ordered
to review your records.

351
00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:57.612
You were discharged
from the service 18 months ago

352
00:19:57.695 --> 00:19:59.071
for willful insubordination.

353
00:20:00.698 --> 00:20:02.241
You disobeyed a direct order

354
00:20:02.325 --> 00:20:05.453
and lost a 30 million dollar fighter
in the process.

355
00:20:05.536 --> 00:20:10.082
Yes, I did but I'm paying it off
at 10 bucks a week

356
00:20:10.166 --> 00:20:12.668
I wouldn't be doing that if gotten
that extra collision coverage.

357
00:20:13.252 --> 00:20:15.796
Wasn't your father involved
in a similar incident?

358
00:20:16.464 --> 00:20:17.548
What do you mean?

359
00:20:17.632 --> 00:20:19.008
Leland "buzz" Harley.

360
00:20:19.091 --> 00:20:21.385
Three purple hearts,
presidential commendation...

361
00:20:22.136 --> 00:20:24.513
Then this incident--
the Dominic farnham death.

362
00:20:25.097 --> 00:20:27.934
In 1971, his visa card was canceled.
(Thumping)

363
00:20:28.017 --> 00:20:31.771
1975, a broken man
suffocated while working

364
00:20:31.854 --> 00:20:33.606
the night shift in a fotomat booth.

365
00:20:35.691 --> 00:20:37.693
Tell me how these events affected you.

366
00:20:39.695 --> 00:20:42.323
Well, I don't think about it much.

367
00:20:44.325 --> 00:20:45.576
That was a long time ago.

368
00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.912
If you'll excuse me,
I have some guns to grease.

369
00:20:49.288 --> 00:20:50.248
Lieutenant...

370
00:20:50.331 --> 00:20:53.626
Have you thought about seeing
a psychiatrist on a regular basis?

371
00:20:54.085 --> 00:20:56.170
I thought you'd never ask.

372
00:20:56.545 --> 00:20:57.797
I mean professionally.

373
00:21:00.383 --> 00:21:01.634
Thanks, doctor.

374
00:21:02.551 --> 00:21:04.011
Thanks for the advice.

375
00:21:04.387 --> 00:21:06.013
Be careful out there, lieutenant.

376
00:21:06.097 --> 00:21:07.974
Don't worry, I can take care of myself.

377
00:21:08.057 --> 00:21:09.767
No, you can't.
You're going to get hurt.

378
00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:11.978
I don't need your help or anybody's help.

379
00:21:12.061 --> 00:21:13.604
I'll be just fine.

380
00:21:13.688 --> 00:21:16.816
(Skeleton chattering)

381
00:21:16.899 --> 00:21:18.067
(Thuds)

382
00:21:18.818 --> 00:21:19.860
Are you okay?

383
00:21:22.321 --> 00:21:23.572
Uhh!

384
00:21:24.949 --> 00:21:28.286
Yeah...I'm fine.

385
00:21:30.871 --> 00:21:32.164
Ohh!

386
00:21:35.668 --> 00:21:36.669
Attention on deck.

387
00:21:38.129 --> 00:21:39.588
At ease, men.

388
00:21:43.551 --> 00:21:44.552
Be seated.

389
00:21:47.388 --> 00:21:49.265
Many of you are wondering
what's wrong with my pants.

390
00:21:49.348 --> 00:21:51.684
Well, they started running short of
material right before they got to the knees.

391
00:21:51.767 --> 00:21:53.602
So don't give me any shit.

392
00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:58.220
Now, I look out there at all of
you guys and I say to myself

393
00:21:58.232 --> 00:22:01.235
"what I wouldn't give
to be 20 years younger

394
00:22:01.819 --> 00:22:02.903
and a woman."

395
00:22:04.447 --> 00:22:06.490
You know, I've personally flown
over 194 missions,

396
00:22:06.574 --> 00:22:09.160
and I was shot down every one.

397
00:22:09.243 --> 00:22:13.164
Come to think of it,
I've never landed a plane in my life.

398
00:22:13.247 --> 00:22:15.041
Now, you men will be piloting

399
00:22:15.124 --> 00:22:18.044
<i>the backbone</i>
<i>of our proud American arsenal--</i>

400
00:22:18.127 --> 00:22:22.006

401
00:22:22.089 --> 00:22:24.342

402
00:22:24.425 --> 00:22:26.886

00:22:42.735 --> 00:22:44.612
-Admiral.

409
00:22:44.695 --> 00:22:46.572
Block: <i>Gentlemen,</i>
<i>the success of sleepy weasel</i>

410
00:22:46.655 --> 00:22:49.241
<i>depends on our ability to maneuver</i>
<i>below enemy radar.</i>

411
00:22:49.325 --> 00:22:51.702
I want to see a major display
of low-level flying.

412
00:22:51.786 --> 00:22:53.371
Topper, Kent, you're up first.

413
00:22:53.454 --> 00:22:54.830
Show me what you can do.

414
00:22:54.914 --> 00:22:57.041
Kent: <i>Copy that,</i>
<i>purple fluffernutter.</i>

415
00:22:57.124 --> 00:22:59.335
Topper:
<i>Roger that, milli vanilli chilly Willy.</i>

416
00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.422
Bring them down, boys.

417
00:23:03.506 --> 00:23:06.133
<i>I want your bellies

418
00:23:06.217 --> 00:23:07.468
<i>Let's see who's the best.</i>

419
00:23:07.802 --> 00:23:09.970
Kent: <i>I'm heading
for the canyon floor, sir.</i>

420
00:23:15.059 --> 00:23:17.103
For your information, I'm at 150 feet.

421
00:23:17.186 --> 00:23:19.230
I'm at third and main.

422
00:23:19.313 --> 00:23:20.856
Ah! Whoa!

423
00:23:27.613 --> 00:23:30.533
Very pretty, but enough hot-dogging.

424
00:23:30.616 --> 00:23:32.952
Just checking the traffic.

425
00:23:38.249 --> 00:23:39.750
How'd I do, big fella?

426
00:23:39.959 --> 00:23:41.293
Don't get me started, Harley.

427
00:23:41.377 --> 00:23:42.461
Block: <i>Cut the chatter.</i>

428
00:23:42.545 --> 00:23:44.505
Topper, that was vintage buzz Harley.

429
00:23:44.588 --> 00:23:47.383
(Echoing) You and your dad
are two of a kind.

430
00:23:47.466 --> 00:23:50.052
Herring's voice: <i>Your ego's</i>
<i>writing checks your body can't cash.</i>

431
00:23:53.722 --> 00:23:54.723
<i>Block: Topper, what are you doing?</i>

432
00:23:54.807 --> 00:23:56.475
<i>Get back in formation.</i>

433
00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.149
Block: <i>Topper, you weren't</i>
<i>cleared to detach.</i>

434
00:24:06.569 --> 00:24:07.903
What was that about?

435
00:24:07.987 --> 00:24:10.239
I, uh, thought I saw Elvis.

436
00:24:10.948 --> 00:24:13.284
Let it go, topper. The king is gone.
Let's head for home.

437
00:24:24.962 --> 00:24:28.382
Oh, not again.
I need a landing clearance

438
00:24:28.466 --> 00:24:31.677
for runway 30... 30 something.

439
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.972
30-30 something's <i>been canceled.</i>
<i>Go to runway 2-9er.</i>

00:24:44.066 --> 00:24:49.070
<i>Wash out, where the hell are you? What

442
00:24:49.071 --> 00:24:50.655
<i>Repeat: What is your location?</i>
<i>You're off of radar.</i>

<i>♫ it's not unusual to be loved by anyone ♫</i>

444
00:24:58.747 --> 00:25:00.690

- Yes.

445
00:25:10.966 --> 00:25:12.468
Can I press your button?

446
00:25:12.551 --> 00:25:15.471
No, you've been slaving
over hot psychotics all day.

447
00:25:16.347 --> 00:25:17.806
Let me get that.

448
00:25:18.849 --> 00:25:20.184
(Sniffing)

449
00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:24.605
That is an interesting perfume.

450
00:25:24.688 --> 00:25:26.649
It's vicks. I have a cold.

451
00:25:26.732 --> 00:25:28.943
Oh.

452
00:25:29.568 --> 00:25:31.987
Lieutenant, you're staring.

453
00:25:32.071 --> 00:25:35.074
No, not really. I'm lost in your eyes.

454
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.160
That is the whitest white part of the eye

455
00:25:38.244 --> 00:25:39.578
I've ever seen.

456
00:25:39.995 --> 00:25:41.288
Do you floss?

457
00:25:41.372 --> 00:25:43.207
You're very confident, aren't you?

458
00:25:44.041 --> 00:25:47.586
When you have 10,000 pounds of thrust
at your command, you have to be.

459
00:25:48.254 --> 00:25:51.173
Lieutenant, please, i'm--
I'm talking to you as a psychiatrist.

460
00:25:53.175 --> 00:25:55.719
I'm recommending that you be grounded.

461
00:25:56.804 --> 00:25:58.222
You've got to be joking.

462
00:25:58.305 --> 00:26:00.266
Look, if I were joking, I would have said,

463
00:26:00.349 --> 00:26:02.601
"what do you do
with an elephant with three balls?"

464
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:05.229
You walk him and pitch to the rhino.

465
00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:08.065
You are serious.

466
00:26:08.148 --> 00:26:10.401
It's the best thing
for you and the mission.

467
00:26:10.484 --> 00:26:13.487
The best would be if you'd
stop tryin' to run my life.

468
00:26:14.113 --> 00:26:15.447
I'm a pilot.

469
00:26:15.531 --> 00:26:16.949
Nobody's going to keep me out of the sky.

470
00:26:20.536 --> 00:26:21.954
Ladies and gentlemen,

471
00:26:22.037 --> 00:26:26.667
12 rounds of boxing for the wba, wbc, wpa,

472
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:31.213
rsvp
heavyweight championship of the world.

473
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.341
Introducing celebrities at ringside,

474
00:26:34.425 --> 00:26:36.385
please welcome his holiness,

475
00:26:36.468 --> 00:26:38.137
the very popular pontiff,

476
00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:42.016
pope John Paul the second.
(Cheering and whistling)

477
00:26:42.516 --> 00:26:43.517
Second!

478
00:26:47.563 --> 00:26:50.357
Lieutenant commander block,
we meet at last.

479
00:26:50.441 --> 00:26:52.192
Isn't this place a little public?

480
00:26:52.276 --> 00:26:54.903
Actually, a crowd offers
remarkable anonymity.

481
00:26:56.071 --> 00:26:57.865
How are we doing at Dudley?

482
00:26:57.948 --> 00:26:59.575
Well, we're right on schedule.

483
00:27:00.743 --> 00:27:02.411
Can't quite get a reading
on admiral Benson,

484
00:27:02.494 --> 00:27:04.747
but topper Harley's
playing right into our hands.

485
00:27:05.873 --> 00:27:07.082
Here's his evaluation.

486
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:10.210
Clear-cut case
of paternal conflict syndrome.

487
00:27:10.794 --> 00:27:12.254
Ah, yes, pcs.

488
00:27:12.338 --> 00:27:15.090
I saw an after-school special
on that the other day.

489
00:27:15.174 --> 00:27:16.967
They're years away from the vaccine.

490
00:27:17.426 --> 00:27:19.970
Every time I mention
buzz' name, topper goes off.

491
00:27:21.013 --> 00:27:22.389
There's no way the unit will function,

492
00:27:22.848 --> 00:27:24.183
and I'll abort the mission.

493
00:27:24.975 --> 00:27:27.394
The Navy's planes will seem inferior,

494
00:27:27.478 --> 00:27:30.439
and the president will come begging
for my superfighter.

495
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:33.567
Best of all, nobody gets hurt.

496
00:27:33.651 --> 00:27:35.611
Well done, lieutenant commander.

497
00:27:36.445 --> 00:27:38.864
America can't afford
to fall behind, Mr. Wilson.

498
00:27:39.823 --> 00:27:40.908
We need your plane.

499
00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:42.618
This should be a good match.

500
00:27:42.743 --> 00:27:44.244
Both men work for Don King.

501
00:27:44.328 --> 00:27:46.455
(Bell dings)

502
00:27:51.126 --> 00:27:52.294
Well, fans, that's it.

503
00:27:52.378 --> 00:27:54.546
Good night. I'm out of here!

504
00:27:56.006 --> 00:27:57.341
The strafing run is proud to present

505
00:27:57.424 --> 00:27:59.551
the musical stylings of Lawrence lipps!

506
00:27:59.635 --> 00:28:02.304
-And now...

00:28:15.484 --> 00:28:17.653

512
00:28:20.906 --> 00:28:21.990
Ramada?

513
00:28:23.659 --> 00:28:24.743
Kent.

514
00:28:24.827 --> 00:28:25.911
Ramada.

515
00:28:26.578 --> 00:28:27.579
Aah!

516
00:28:27.663 --> 00:28:28.664
(Speaking French)

517
00:28:30.374 --> 00:28:32.960
-(Glass shatters)
-Aah! My eyes!

518
00:28:33.043 --> 00:28:36.004
But darling, why didn't you call?
I thought you were still in Brussels.

519
00:28:36.088 --> 00:28:38.674
Oh, Kent, we were only hurting each other.

520
00:28:38.757 --> 00:28:40.384
I thought that's the way you wanted it.

521
00:28:42.177 --> 00:28:43.679
Something's changed, hasn't it?

522
00:28:44.763 --> 00:28:45.764
It's not another woman, is it?

523
00:28:45.848 --> 00:28:47.474
I just couldn't compete with that.

524
00:28:47.558 --> 00:28:50.060
No, of course you couldn't.

525
00:28:50.602 --> 00:28:52.354
What matters is that you're here.

526
00:28:52.438 --> 00:28:54.940
I'm here. We have a lot
of catching up to do.

527
00:28:55.023 --> 00:28:57.401
Wonderful. Just let me
take care of something.

528
00:28:57.484 --> 00:28:58.485
I'll be right back.

529
00:28:58.569 --> 00:28:59.695
Don't be long, <i>mon amour.</i>

530
00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:00.863

Anybody here from out of town?

551
00:30:09.223 --> 00:30:10.224
Welcome.

552
00:30:11.099 --> 00:30:12.392

(Applause)

579
00:31:50.991 --> 00:31:52.034
Kent: Ramada.

580
00:31:52.117 --> 00:31:53.535
Oh, no.

581
00:31:54.036 --> 00:31:56.872
Well, if it isn't
god's gift to the cockpit.

582
00:31:57.915 --> 00:31:59.791
Kent, your nostrils are flaring.

583
00:31:59.875 --> 00:32:01.877
That flying stunt today was pure madness.

584
00:32:02.753 --> 00:32:04.004
If there wasn't a lady present,

585
00:32:04.087 --> 00:32:06.048
I'd tear you apart like a Christmas goose.

586
00:32:06.131 --> 00:32:09.593
Yeah! Keep it up, you'll be carrying
your face home in a doggy bag.

587
00:32:09.676 --> 00:32:11.261
What is this macho thing?

588
00:32:12.346 --> 00:32:13.430
He started it.

589
00:32:13.513 --> 00:32:14.973
-Did not.
-Did, too.

590
00:32:15.057 --> 00:32:16.850
-Did not.
-You're behaving like children.

591
00:32:16.934 --> 00:32:18.352
He's being a jerk.

592
00:32:18.435 --> 00:32:19.937
-Am not.
-Are, too.

593
00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.104
Am not.

594
00:32:21.188 --> 00:32:22.481
Are too, too, too...

595
00:32:22.564 --> 00:32:23.690
Not, not, not...

596
00:32:23.774 --> 00:32:25.525
Are too times 10.

597
00:32:25.984 --> 00:32:26.985
That's it.

598
00:32:27.069 --> 00:32:28.904
-Stop it.
-Rumble!

599
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:30.030
-Don't push me.
-Guy: Rumble!

600
00:32:30.113 --> 00:32:32.074
Hey!

601
00:32:32.157 --> 00:32:34.910
(Shouting)

602
00:32:35.953 --> 00:32:38.789
(Shouting)

603
00:32:38.872 --> 00:32:42.459
Stop it! Can't you act like
civilized human beings?

604
00:32:42.542 --> 00:32:44.419
Hey, I'm sorry, man.

605
00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:46.463
Oh, thanks.

606
00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:50.801
Listen, Kent and I have to talk,

607
00:32:50.884 --> 00:32:52.511
so, please...

608
00:32:53.261 --> 00:32:54.680
Be my guest.

609
00:33:04.648 --> 00:33:05.732
Let's celebrate, honey.

610
00:33:06.984 --> 00:33:08.944
Hey, everybody, drinks are on me.

611
00:33:09.069 --> 00:33:10.737
-Free beer!
-Gin sling!

612
00:33:22.165 --> 00:33:25.085
You haven't forgotten my offer, have you?

613
00:33:25.168 --> 00:33:27.587
Little house in the country,
white picket fence,

614
00:33:27.671 --> 00:33:29.256
stairmaster, the whole 9 yards.

615
00:33:29.339 --> 00:33:32.676
Kent, you're everything a woman
could possibly want,

616
00:33:33.385 --> 00:33:34.928
but I'm just not ready for marriage.

617
00:33:35.262 --> 00:33:36.304
Not yet.

618
00:33:37.723 --> 00:33:39.558
Well, I have to be
getting back to the base.

619
00:33:40.267 --> 00:33:41.393
Tomorrow's an important flight.

620
00:33:41.518 --> 00:33:43.603
You know how puffy my eyes
get when I don't rest.

621
00:33:47.607 --> 00:33:48.608
Good night.

622
00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:54.072
(Gasps)

623
00:33:54.156 --> 00:33:55.198
May I?

624
00:33:56.199 --> 00:33:58.660
Shouldn't you be getting
back to the base?

625
00:33:58.744 --> 00:34:01.038
I suppose, if I played life by the rules,

626
00:34:01.121 --> 00:34:02.289
but you know I don't.

627
00:34:03.248 --> 00:34:05.583
All right. You can walk me
to my apartment.

628
00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:10.547
I shouldn't have gotten mad
in the elevator today.

629
00:34:12.174 --> 00:34:14.468
Just when I want something that bad,
I get all fired up.

630
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:17.012
Maybe that's why I worry so.

631
00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:19.097
Maybe more than I should.

632
00:34:19.181 --> 00:34:20.807
Something terrible
could happen. You must--

633
00:34:21.224 --> 00:34:22.559
shh, shh.

634
00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:24.603
But i--

635
00:34:24.686 --> 00:34:26.104
don't worry.

636
00:34:26.855 --> 00:34:28.857
Everything will be fine.
I promise.

637
00:34:29.649 --> 00:34:31.151
B-Boy, I hope so.

638
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:40.243
Well, this is it.

639
00:34:42.037 --> 00:34:43.413
It's a nice place.

640
00:34:43.747 --> 00:34:44.831
It's okay.

641
00:34:44.915 --> 00:34:47.667
The only problem is
I have a nosy landlady.

642
00:34:50.879 --> 00:34:52.547
Well, I guess
this is good night.

643
00:34:53.548 --> 00:34:54.925
I don't want to go back.

644
00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.261
You don't have to.

645
00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:00.388
I don't want to be alone.

646
00:35:01.389 --> 00:35:02.682
And by the way,

647
00:35:02.766 --> 00:35:04.643
I can go all nigh like a lumberjack.

648
00:35:08.063 --> 00:35:09.523
What about your landlady?

649
00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.733
You can do her, too.

650
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:30.293
So, I take it you've
been with a man before.

651
00:35:31.294 --> 00:35:32.671
I'm a virgin.

652
00:35:34.005 --> 00:35:35.674
I'm just not very good at it.

653
00:35:37.134 --> 00:35:38.510
(Gulp)

654
00:36:35.275 --> 00:36:36.985
Ohh.

655
00:36:52.709 --> 00:36:54.127
(Plop)

656
00:36:54.211 --> 00:36:55.462
Ooh.

657
00:36:58.048 --> 00:36:59.132
Ahh.

658
00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:01.176
Ohh.

659
00:37:01.259 --> 00:37:02.886
Ohh.

660
00:37:02.969 --> 00:37:05.305
Ooh.

661
00:37:05.388 --> 00:37:07.849
Mmm.

662
00:37:09.059 --> 00:37:10.060
Yes.

663
00:37:10.143 --> 00:37:11.728
Oh, yes.

664
00:37:13.605 --> 00:37:16.024
Ahh.

665
00:37:17.192 --> 00:37:18.568
Ahh.

666
00:37:21.655 --> 00:37:22.906
Mmm.

667
00:37:22.989 --> 00:37:24.032
Mmm.

668
00:37:27.244 --> 00:37:28.286
Ohh.

669
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:29.621
Topper.

670
00:37:37.963 --> 00:37:39.047
Mmm.

671
00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:40.215
Ohh.

672
00:37:40.423 --> 00:37:41.466
Ohh.

673
00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:43.301
Ohh.

674
00:37:51.226 --> 00:37:53.520
(Playing reveille)

675
00:37:53.603 --> 00:37:57.315
(Shouting)

676
00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.526
Uhh!

677
00:38:06.283 --> 00:38:07.284
Wash out.

678
00:38:09.786 --> 00:38:10.912
What are you doing?
Get into your flight suit.

679
00:38:10.996 --> 00:38:12.205
We're ready to go up.

680
00:38:12.956 --> 00:38:14.249
I just got kicked out of the unit.

681
00:38:14.374 --> 00:38:15.875
My flight status has been withdrawn.

682
00:38:16.459 --> 00:38:17.627
I'm through, dead meat.

683
00:38:17.711 --> 00:38:19.045
What happened?

684
00:38:19.379 --> 00:38:20.463
It's my eyes.

685
00:38:20.547 --> 00:38:21.715
I've got walleye vision.

686
00:38:21.798 --> 00:38:22.841
(Gasps)

687
00:38:22.924 --> 00:38:24.467
(Sighs) Yeah.

688
00:38:24.551 --> 00:38:26.011
Can't something that could be done?

689
00:38:26.094 --> 00:38:29.014
Well, there's a delicate corneal
inversion procedure--

690
00:38:29.097 --> 00:38:30.640
multioptipupiloptomy.

691
00:38:31.224 --> 00:38:33.018
But in order to keep from
damaging the eye socket,

692
00:38:33.101 --> 00:38:34.352
they gotta go in through the rectum.

693
00:38:36.146 --> 00:38:37.647
Ain't no man gonna
take that route with me.

694
00:38:38.231 --> 00:38:39.274
Yeah.

695
00:38:40.191 --> 00:38:41.693
Is topper around?
I'd like to say goodbye.

696
00:38:42.652 --> 00:38:44.070
He didn't come back last night.

697
00:38:44.863 --> 00:38:45.864
I'm afraid he's awol.

698
00:38:45.947 --> 00:38:47.365
As soon as block finds out, he's history.

699
00:38:48.033 --> 00:38:50.827
But, flying's his life.
He's the best pilot in the world.

700
00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:52.037
We need him as much as he needs US.

701
00:38:52.996 --> 00:38:55.957
Can't find my lucky gum.
Do you have--

702
00:38:56.624 --> 00:38:57.625
wash out?

703
00:39:00.211 --> 00:39:01.254
(Ring ring)

704
00:39:04.466 --> 00:39:06.926
(Crash)

705
00:39:11.473 --> 00:39:13.058
Oh, my god.

706
00:39:13.141 --> 00:39:14.601
I missed my flight.

707
00:39:14.684 --> 00:39:16.269
(Kisses) You're amazing.

708
00:39:19.856 --> 00:39:21.107
Dead meat!

709
00:39:22.734 --> 00:39:23.777
Mary!

710
00:39:25.695 --> 00:39:29.532
Mary. Have you come to watch me fly?

711
00:39:29.616 --> 00:39:31.326
There was a meltdown at the plant,

712
00:39:31.409 --> 00:39:32.869
so they gave me the afternoon off.

713
00:39:32.952 --> 00:39:34.037
Aw, terrific.

714
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.288
(Meow)

715
00:39:35.497 --> 00:39:36.998
Oh, good news.

716
00:39:37.582 --> 00:39:39.793
We just closed escrow on our dream house.

717
00:39:39.876 --> 00:39:41.461
Wonderful. When do we move in?

718
00:39:41.544 --> 00:39:45.215
Tuesday. I've got the kids stripping
asbestos off the pipes right now.

719
00:39:45.298 --> 00:39:46.299
Oh, that's great!

720
00:39:46.383 --> 00:39:48.927
Things just couldn't be better for US.

721
00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:50.512
I'm so blessed.

722
00:39:50.595 --> 00:39:54.516
Oh! Your life insurance forms
came for you to sign.

723
00:39:55.266 --> 00:39:56.267
(Glass breaks)

724
00:39:56.351 --> 00:39:57.644
Oh! Oh, my mirror.

725
00:40:01.356 --> 00:40:02.399
Huh!

726
00:40:03.566 --> 00:40:04.818
I'll get another pen.

727
00:40:04.901 --> 00:40:07.612
No need.
I'll sign it when I get back.

728
00:40:07.695 --> 00:40:09.114
Well, you know best.

729
00:40:09.197 --> 00:40:11.783
Honey, you know that
global warming problem?

730
00:40:11.866 --> 00:40:13.410
I've discovered
how we can reverse it.

731
00:40:13.493 --> 00:40:14.577
Tell me.

732
00:40:14.661 --> 00:40:16.454
No, not now, lovey-bumpers.

733
00:40:16.538 --> 00:40:18.289
There'll be plenty of time for that later.

734
00:40:18.873 --> 00:40:21.918
And my investigation into the
assassination of jfk?

735
00:40:22.001 --> 00:40:24.003
You found the evidence you're looking for!

736
00:40:24.087 --> 00:40:26.506
Yes. I have proof right here in my pocket.

737
00:40:26.589 --> 00:40:29.843
It's big, honey. Really big.
Goes all the way to the white house.

738
00:40:29.926 --> 00:40:31.594
Do you want me to hold it for you?

739
00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.013
No. It'll be safe right here.

740
00:40:34.347 --> 00:40:35.390
I'm in a jet.

741
00:40:35.473 --> 00:40:36.641
What could go wrong?

742
00:40:36.724 --> 00:40:38.184
Oh, dead meat,

743
00:40:38.518 --> 00:40:41.396
we just couldn't be any more
perfectly happy.

744
00:40:49.028 --> 00:40:50.488
Where the hell is topper?

745
00:40:52.615 --> 00:40:54.033
Thanks for joining the party.

746
00:40:54.742 --> 00:40:55.869
Hey, topper!

747
00:40:55.952 --> 00:40:58.079
Hey, have you seen any of my lucky gum?

748
00:40:58.163 --> 00:40:59.497
Uh, no.

749
00:41:01.458 --> 00:41:03.960
Freedom squadron, start your engines.

750
00:41:06.171 --> 00:41:07.213
God, that's loud.

751
00:41:07.672 --> 00:41:08.840
My ear canals are very sensitive.

752
00:41:08.923 --> 00:41:11.217
They're stainless steel.
Took a bullet in corregidor.

753
00:41:11.301 --> 00:41:14.762
Passed straight through.
Here, look.

754
00:41:14.846 --> 00:41:18.850
(Cloth rubbing metal)

755
00:41:20.477 --> 00:41:21.644
Huh?

756
00:41:23.646 --> 00:41:25.899
We have these
to hold down the sound, sir.

757
00:41:26.232 --> 00:41:28.443
Oh, good. Thanks.

758
00:41:31.696 --> 00:41:32.906
Let's hope they do the trick.

759
00:41:32.989 --> 00:41:34.782
Give me the Mike, boy.

760
00:41:35.366 --> 00:41:37.911
For the love of god, man, be careful.

761
00:41:37.994 --> 00:41:40.838
Ever since normandy,
this is corning ware for Christ's sake

762
00:41:41.039 --> 00:41:45.460
<i>those of you who excel</i>
<i>during these aerial combat exercises</i>

763
00:41:45.585 --> 00:41:50.215
<i>will go on to make up</i>
<i>the greatest fighting unit ever assembled.</i>

764
00:41:52.842 --> 00:41:54.219
Topper, keep that nose up!

765
00:41:54.302 --> 00:41:55.929
He's never done that before.

766
00:41:56.012 --> 00:41:59.682
Red team leader, break off.
Prepare to engage.

767
00:41:59.766 --> 00:42:02.519
Roger that.

768
00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:06.564
<i>Blue leader, prepare for action.</i>

769
00:42:06.648 --> 00:42:07.982
Roger that.

770
00:42:16.074 --> 00:42:17.951
I'm on his 6:00. Moving in.

771
00:42:19.953 --> 00:42:21.579
I've got tone.

772
00:42:21.663 --> 00:42:22.664
Got him!

773
00:42:22.747 --> 00:42:24.874
Dead meat, confirm kill.

774
00:42:32.632 --> 00:42:33.716
Mrs. Thompson?

775
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.677
-Yes?
-I'm topper Harley.

776
00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.096
Oh! Dead meat's talked about you.

777
00:42:38.179 --> 00:42:39.931
He thinks the world of you.

778
00:42:40.807 --> 00:42:42.600
But shouldn't you be up there
flying with the squad?

779
00:42:47.355 --> 00:42:48.565
I've got a lock.

780
00:42:48.773 --> 00:42:50.024
I'm closing in.

781
00:42:50.358 --> 00:42:51.442
Goose: Uh-oh!

782
00:42:51.526 --> 00:42:53.152
He spotted me! He's slippery!

783
00:42:53.236 --> 00:42:54.529
Geese: Help! Help!

784
00:42:55.989 --> 00:42:58.116
Topper, watch your right side! Jeez!

785
00:42:58.199 --> 00:43:00.743
I'm bailing out!

786
00:43:04.622 --> 00:43:06.833
Wash out? What are you doing here?

787
00:43:06.916 --> 00:43:08.668
There's no time to go into it.

788
00:43:09.377 --> 00:43:10.712
Uh-oh.

789
00:43:10.795 --> 00:43:12.839
<i>Do me a favor. Don't land.</i>

790
00:43:12.922 --> 00:43:14.841
What's...

791
00:43:14.924 --> 00:43:16.676
Get out of here!
We're gonna crash!

792
00:43:16.759 --> 00:43:18.219
I can't. I'm stuck.

793
00:43:18.303 --> 00:43:21.431
Then I must help you my friend.
Think well of me.

794
00:43:21.514 --> 00:43:24.142
Ooh! Ooh! Aah!

795
00:43:25.143 --> 00:43:27.228
Thank you!

796
00:43:27.312 --> 00:43:28.813
Don't look.

797
00:43:28.896 --> 00:43:30.440
Oh, no! Oh!

798
00:43:30.523 --> 00:43:31.566
Whoa!

799
00:43:38.323 --> 00:43:39.324
Ow! Ow!

800
00:43:39.407 --> 00:43:43.453
(Siren wailing)

801
00:43:50.501 --> 00:43:51.502
Whew.

802
00:43:53.004 --> 00:43:54.380
Oh, man!

803
00:43:54.464 --> 00:43:56.716
Wendy, I can fly!

804
00:44:02.722 --> 00:44:04.390
Hey, topper.

805
00:44:04.724 --> 00:44:06.100
Easy, buddy.

806
00:44:07.894 --> 00:44:09.270
The darnedest thing just happened.

807
00:44:09.354 --> 00:44:11.022
Hang on. Hang on, buddy.

808
00:44:11.356 --> 00:44:12.523
Topper?

809
00:44:13.024 --> 00:44:13.900
Ohh!

810
00:44:13.983 --> 00:44:16.027
Swing him around this way.

811
00:44:16.277 --> 00:44:17.278
Ohh.

812
00:44:17.695 --> 00:44:18.738
Ohh.

813
00:44:18.821 --> 00:44:21.115
Let's go.
1...2.

814
00:44:22.116 --> 00:44:23.618
In the door.
Let's move it. Come on.

815
00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:26.788
Enough!

816
00:44:30.875 --> 00:44:31.918
Hello!

817
00:44:38.591 --> 00:44:39.801
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

818
00:44:39.884 --> 00:44:42.387
Ow, ow, ow, ow! Oh!

819
00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:51.854
Aah!

820
00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:53.815
Aah!

821
00:44:53.898 --> 00:44:56.067
Relay buddy. We'll have you at
the hospital in no time.

822
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:58.111
Aah!

823
00:45:02.615 --> 00:45:04.158
Good morning!
Excuse me!

824
00:45:05.576 --> 00:45:07.787
Wait, guys, wait! Aah!

825
00:45:08.871 --> 00:45:09.956
Let's go, let's go.

826
00:45:10.665 --> 00:45:12.375
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

827
00:45:13.835 --> 00:45:14.877
Let's move.

828
00:45:14.961 --> 00:45:16.295
What a ride.

829
00:45:17.004 --> 00:45:18.214
Wash out, you made it.

830
00:45:18.297 --> 00:45:19.590
Why, thank you, Andre.

831
00:45:19.674 --> 00:45:21.175
I'll have the veal piccata.

832
00:45:24.804 --> 00:45:26.472
Oh! Don't forget the cardio readout.

833
00:45:26.556 --> 00:45:27.640
Where is it?

834
00:45:27.724 --> 00:45:28.808
Um...

835
00:45:28.891 --> 00:45:29.934
It's, uh...

836
00:45:30.059 --> 00:45:31.102
Hey, fellas...

837
00:45:31.185 --> 00:45:32.186
...inside on the left.

838
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:33.396
I can't find it!

839
00:45:35.982 --> 00:45:37.066
Doctor.

840
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:38.735
-What happened?
-Plane crash.

841
00:45:40.862 --> 00:45:42.405
I got to work fast.
I got a lunch.

842
00:45:43.072 --> 00:45:44.741
I think you're missing
the big picture here, doc.

843
00:45:44.824 --> 00:45:47.034
Nurse, check his penis.
Is it longer than mine?

844
00:45:47.118 --> 00:45:48.119
No, doctor.

845
00:45:48.202 --> 00:45:49.537
Good. Now, this is gonna hurt.

846
00:45:49.996 --> 00:45:50.997
Aah!

847
00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:53.249
Nurse, give me 15ccs of morphine quickly.

848
00:45:53.916 --> 00:45:54.959
You thing you can save him?

849
00:45:55.042 --> 00:45:56.794
Can't be sure.
I'm not a very good doctor.

850
00:45:56.878 --> 00:45:58.588
That's good thank you, nurse.
You have to wait here.

851
00:45:58.671 --> 00:45:59.964
You're gonna be all right, buddy.

852
00:46:00.047 --> 00:46:02.675
I'm in a hospital.
What could go wrong?

853
00:46:12.351 --> 00:46:14.937
Mrs. Thompson, I know
you must hate me right now,

854
00:46:15.021 --> 00:46:18.483
but there's something I want you to have.

855
00:46:18.566 --> 00:46:20.318
I've been putting a little away
for the past 10 years.

856
00:46:20.401 --> 00:46:22.403
It's not much--2,500.

857
00:46:22.487 --> 00:46:24.280
I wish I could do more.

858
00:46:25.281 --> 00:46:26.908
Why, topper...

859
00:46:27.325 --> 00:46:29.202
Th-that's so sweet.

860
00:46:31.204 --> 00:46:34.457
Why, with the 3 million I won
on this lucky lotto ticket,

861
00:46:35.249 --> 00:46:40.129
I can take this 2,500
and just blow it all on hats.

862
00:46:44.383 --> 00:46:47.053
Right and halt.

863
00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:52.225
(Dog yelps)

864
00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.983
Pete "dead meat" Thompson is dead.

865
00:47:01.734 --> 00:47:03.152
So is mo green,

866
00:47:03.486 --> 00:47:06.489
tataglia, barzini,

867
00:47:06.572 --> 00:47:08.658
the heads of all the five families.

868
00:47:09.992 --> 00:47:12.537
It is at moments like these,
my dear friends,

869
00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:14.038
we must ask ourselves,

870
00:47:14.121 --> 00:47:17.583
"how can this not be part
of some larger plan?"

871
00:47:17.667 --> 00:47:19.377
Do good men like dead meat Thompson

872
00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:22.213
just blink out one day like a bad bulb?

873
00:47:22.296 --> 00:47:25.299
I mean one minute, you're in bed
with a knockout gal or guy,

874
00:47:26.008 --> 00:47:27.927
and the next, you're a compost heap.

875
00:47:28.636 --> 00:47:30.388
Well, doesn't that bother any of you?

876
00:47:30.471 --> 00:47:32.181
Because it scares
the living piss out of me!

877
00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:35.893
I never thought something like this
could happen.

878
00:47:37.019 --> 00:47:38.771
Don't we have what we need now, mr Wilson?

879
00:47:39.438 --> 00:47:42.149
This should be enough to prove
that our planes need to be replaced.

880
00:47:42.733 --> 00:47:44.610
No, those planes have to fail in combat

881
00:47:44.694 --> 00:47:45.945
for the world to take notice.

882
00:47:46.028 --> 00:47:47.947
This is a minor incident.

883
00:47:48.406 --> 00:47:51.492
Minor? I just lost one of my best men.

884
00:47:52.618 --> 00:47:54.370
Are you backing out on US, block?

885
00:47:55.288 --> 00:47:58.833
I'm doing this for my country,
not for you.

886
00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:05.715
We'll need the backup plan.

887
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:07.592
Aim.

888
00:48:07.675 --> 00:48:09.051
Fire!

889
00:48:09.218 --> 00:48:10.553
Jumping Jesus, they're back.

890
00:48:10.636 --> 00:48:11.637
Fire!

891
00:48:11.804 --> 00:48:13.598
People, take cover!

892
00:48:13.681 --> 00:48:14.765
Hit the dirt!

893
00:48:17.143 --> 00:48:18.185
Cover me!

894
00:48:18.519 --> 00:48:19.604
Battle stations!

895
00:48:19.687 --> 00:48:21.272
Battle stations!

896
00:48:24.984 --> 00:48:27.403
Have they no respect for the dead?

897
00:48:27.904 --> 00:48:28.988
Aah!

898
00:48:29.071 --> 00:48:30.615
Aah!

899
00:48:34.076 --> 00:48:35.995
God, I love a good funeral.

900
00:48:55.765 --> 00:48:57.808
Topper. Where are you going?

901
00:48:58.768 --> 00:49:00.394
I'm handing in my resignation.

902
00:49:01.479 --> 00:49:03.439
You were right. You said
I was dangerous, and I am.

903
00:49:03.522 --> 00:49:04.982
Topper, wait.

904
00:49:05.858 --> 00:49:07.151
Please, let's talk.

905
00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:09.236
Huh?

906
00:49:11.656 --> 00:49:12.740
They're right.

907
00:49:12.823 --> 00:49:14.241
I'm no better than my father.

908
00:49:14.909 --> 00:49:15.993
Seems no matter what I do,

909
00:49:16.077 --> 00:49:17.912
I end up hurting someone.

910
00:49:20.373 --> 00:49:21.415
Ouch.

911
00:49:23.668 --> 00:49:26.253
You've got to stop comparing
yourself with your father.

912
00:49:26.545 --> 00:49:27.838
You're two different people.

913
00:49:28.339 --> 00:49:29.465
We both killed a man.

914
00:49:29.799 --> 00:49:31.217
That's just a coincidence.

915
00:49:31.801 --> 00:49:33.177
He loved jets. So do I.

916
00:49:33.844 --> 00:49:35.262
He was a loner just like me.

917
00:49:36.197 --> 00:49:38.415
For god's sakes, I've even
got my father's eyes.

918
00:49:39.308 --> 00:49:40.601
Topper, please.

919
00:49:41.686 --> 00:49:43.229
Ah, they're just for luck.

920
00:49:43.437 --> 00:49:44.897
You've got to make your own luck.

921
00:49:45.773 --> 00:49:48.667
You've got to get back in the sky
and prove yourself.

922
00:49:48.901 --> 00:49:50.744
Besides, there's something else.

923
00:49:52.321 --> 00:49:54.365
After our first meeting in my office,

924
00:49:54.448 --> 00:49:56.993
I sent my evaluation to commander block.

925
00:49:57.952 --> 00:49:59.161
I recommended you be grounded.

926
00:49:59.245 --> 00:50:00.871
I was afraid someone might get hurt.

927
00:50:01.789 --> 00:50:03.124
What are you saying?

928
00:50:04.333 --> 00:50:07.837
I think someone wants
sleepy weasel to fail.

929
00:50:08.462 --> 00:50:09.630
That's heavy.

930
00:50:10.047 --> 00:50:11.132
Totally.

931
00:50:11.465 --> 00:50:13.300
That's the other reason
why you need to fly.

932
00:50:14.051 --> 00:50:17.388
Topper, this could well be your only
opportunity to save the mission

933
00:50:17.471 --> 00:50:19.140
and solve your personal problems,

934
00:50:19.932 --> 00:50:21.350
all in one fell swoop.

935
00:50:33.904 --> 00:50:35.656
Read that back to me, Francine.

936
00:50:37.116 --> 00:50:38.951
"And if you ever put your goddamn hands

937
00:50:39.035 --> 00:50:40.536
on my wife again, I will--"

938
00:50:40.661 --> 00:50:42.204
(knock on door)

939
00:50:43.122 --> 00:50:44.123
You wanted to see me, sir?

940
00:50:44.206 --> 00:50:45.666
Oh, blank, come on in.

941
00:50:46.208 --> 00:50:47.209
Been expecting someone.

942
00:50:47.877 --> 00:50:48.919
That'll be all, Francine.

943
00:50:49.003 --> 00:50:50.171
Yes, sir.

944
00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:55.801
Pudding?

945
00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.303
No, thank you, sir.

946
00:50:57.970 --> 00:50:59.263
I'll put this to you straight.

947
00:50:59.346 --> 00:51:01.515
Thompson's death was a shock to US all,

948
00:51:01.599 --> 00:51:03.267
and hot shot Harley is responsible.

949
00:51:03.642 --> 00:51:06.270
I want that smirking
little wise-ass out of here.

950
00:51:08.606 --> 00:51:10.566
The morale on this base is shot to hell.

951
00:51:11.093 --> 00:51:11.769
There.

952
00:51:12.193 --> 00:51:13.569
Just look out there.

953
00:51:14.528 --> 00:51:15.905
Quiet.

954
00:51:16.197 --> 00:51:17.239
Hardly a man moving.

955
00:51:18.032 --> 00:51:20.034
Roy. Roy!

956
00:51:20.785 --> 00:51:22.328
Ah. Huh?

957
00:51:22.703 --> 00:51:24.121
I went to school with that man.

958
00:51:24.497 --> 00:51:25.498
He's just not the same.

959
00:51:25.581 --> 00:51:26.791
Been ignoring me all day.

960
00:51:27.291 --> 00:51:29.293
Remind me to send him a note.

961
00:51:29.502 --> 00:51:31.629
Sir, may I say something?

962
00:51:32.838 --> 00:51:35.257
I have no doubt that Harley
acted irresponsibly,

963
00:51:35.716 --> 00:51:37.301
but his kind lives on the edge,

964
00:51:37.384 --> 00:51:38.969
always willing to take a chance.

965
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:42.056
Now, we need topper for this mission
for just that reason.

966
00:51:46.435 --> 00:51:48.395
I like your thinking, Carl.

967
00:51:48.479 --> 00:51:50.773
Besides, dead meat Thompson wasn't
all that good a pilot anyway.

968
00:51:50.856 --> 00:51:52.441
He only had a small family.

969
00:51:53.359 --> 00:51:54.443
His kids are a pain in the ass.

970
00:51:54.777 --> 00:51:55.820
Wife's on the sauce.

971
00:51:56.028 --> 00:51:57.822
Poor bastard's better off dead.

972
00:51:59.073 --> 00:52:00.407
What size shoes do you wear?

973
00:52:01.492 --> 00:52:02.868
A 9, sir.

974
00:52:03.244 --> 00:52:05.079
Good. It's settled then.

975
00:52:05.162 --> 00:52:06.205
We'll send Harley to the front.

976
00:52:06.288 --> 00:52:10.084
Oh, by the way, I wanted to thank you
for having US over dinner the other night.

977
00:52:10.584 --> 00:52:12.461
Cheryl and I thought
the stroganoff was marvelous.

978
00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:15.256
But, sir, we didn't
have dinner the other night.

979
00:52:15.798 --> 00:52:16.924
Really?

980
00:52:17.258 --> 00:52:18.384
Where the hell was I?

981
00:52:19.176 --> 00:52:20.553
And who's this Cheryl?

982
00:52:20.845 --> 00:52:22.138
Ah, doesn't matter.

983
00:52:22.888 --> 00:52:24.014
Run along, sid.

984
00:52:27.184 --> 00:52:28.227
Cheryl?

985
00:52:33.607 --> 00:52:34.984
Kent?

986
00:52:39.155 --> 00:52:40.656
I came to get my chafing dish.

987
00:52:40.739 --> 00:52:41.949
Our orders just came through.

988
00:52:42.032 --> 00:52:43.200
We're shipping out in one hour.

989
00:52:43.742 --> 00:52:45.361
Are you coming' along this time?

990
00:52:46.078 --> 00:52:47.371
The chafing dish is not yours.

991
00:52:47.454 --> 00:52:48.664
-Yes, it is.
-No, it isn't.

992
00:52:48.747 --> 00:52:50.249
-Okay, I don't want it.
-Just take it.

993
00:52:50.332 --> 00:52:51.750
-I'll take it.
-You stay out of it.

994
00:52:52.543 --> 00:52:54.044
This is not the time or place,

995
00:52:54.587 --> 00:52:56.630
but I've got a big score to settle
with you, my friend.

996
00:52:58.632 --> 00:53:00.050
Excuse me.

997
00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:06.390
I've hurt him.

998
00:53:07.057 --> 00:53:08.058
Topper...

999
00:53:09.101 --> 00:53:10.436
Topper, you better go.

1000
00:53:10.811 --> 00:53:12.062
I have to think.

1001
00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:13.856
Well, I don't.

1002
00:53:14.607 --> 00:53:16.525
I've fallen for you like a blind roofer.

1003
00:53:17.443 --> 00:53:18.527
I'm sorry?

1004
00:53:18.986 --> 00:53:21.780
My heart has fallen down around my ankles

1005
00:53:21.864 --> 00:53:22.990
like a wet pair of pants.

1006
00:53:25.242 --> 00:53:27.286
My whole life,
all I've wanted to do is fly.

1007
00:53:27.912 --> 00:53:28.913
Bomb stuff.

1008
00:53:28.996 --> 00:53:29.997
Shoot people down.

1009
00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.875
But we've been through so much together.

1010
00:53:33.417 --> 00:53:34.585
Ramada, I need you.

1011
00:53:35.419 --> 00:53:36.503
I want you.

1012
00:53:37.588 --> 00:53:41.425

Ramada!

1024
00:54:21.048 --> 00:54:22.508
Topper.

1025
00:54:24.426 --> 00:54:25.970

Topper, I'm so confused.

1049
00:55:49.136 --> 00:55:51.013
I need time alone.

1050
00:56:18.123 --> 00:56:19.541
Admiral Benson!

1051
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.085
Really?

1052
00:56:21.168 --> 00:56:22.737
That's my name, too.

1053
00:56:24.296 --> 00:56:25.714
Yankee doodle floppy disk,

1054
00:56:25.798 --> 00:56:27.132
this is foxtrot zulu milkshake

1055
00:56:27.186 --> 00:56:29.927
checking in at 700 feet.
Request permission to land.

1056
00:56:29.928 --> 00:56:32.835
Roger that, foxtrot zulu milkshake.
You are clear to land.

1057
00:56:32.861 --> 00:56:35.868
Welcome to the mediterranean.
Wash out, is that you?

1058
00:56:36.475 --> 00:56:38.352
You bet!
They put me in charge of radar.

1059
00:56:39.228 --> 00:56:40.896
From now on,
I'll be your eyes on the ground.

1060
00:56:42.856 --> 00:56:44.441
<i>All crews, report to the flight deck.</i>

1061
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:47.319
<i>All crews, report to the flight deck.</i>

1062
00:56:53.283 --> 00:56:54.326
Ooh...ow.

1063
00:56:59.498 --> 00:57:00.499
Ooh...ow.

1064
00:57:00.582 --> 00:57:02.167
Whoa!

1065
00:57:06.547 --> 00:57:07.589
Ooh.

1066
00:57:07.673 --> 00:57:08.757
Oh.

1067
00:57:27.192 --> 00:57:28.610
Have you no decency?

1068
00:57:40.205 --> 00:57:42.583
Ah, the open sea.

1069
00:57:43.292 --> 00:57:44.626
Oh, god, wish I could smell.

1070
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:46.628
I had my nostrils fried in panmunjom.

1071
00:57:47.796 --> 00:57:50.674
Admiral Benson, I want you to meet

1072
00:57:50.757 --> 00:57:53.135
Mr. Wilson and Mr. Rosener
from rockman aviation.

1073
00:57:53.969 --> 00:57:55.220
They'll be observing the operation.

1074
00:57:55.304 --> 00:57:56.346
Oh, yes, of course.

1075
00:57:57.973 --> 00:57:59.016
It's okay.
I'm all right.

1076
00:57:59.099 --> 00:58:00.350
No problem.

1077
00:58:01.602 --> 00:58:02.978
I slipped on the crab.

1078
00:58:03.312 --> 00:58:04.771
Who put that crab there?

1079
00:58:05.063 --> 00:58:06.356
Crab? I didn't see any crab.

1080
00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:08.817
Don't tell me? There were two crabs.
They work in pairs.

1081
00:58:09.401 --> 00:58:10.861
I went to Annapolis, for Christ's sake.

1082
00:58:11.570 --> 00:58:12.654
From the Pentagon, sir.

1083
00:58:12.738 --> 00:58:13.822
We just decoded it.

1084
00:58:13.906 --> 00:58:15.824
Oh good here. Help me with this.
My eyes are ceramic.

1085
00:58:16.408 --> 00:58:17.659
A bazooka round at little bighorn.

1086
00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:19.495
Or was it okinawa?

1087
00:58:19.578 --> 00:58:20.662
The one without the Indians.

1088
00:58:21.246 --> 00:58:22.372
It's the final orders.

1089
00:58:22.456 --> 00:58:24.082
We strike tomorrow at 0600.

1090
00:58:24.166 --> 00:58:27.211
Excellent.
Wake me up at, oh, 5:30.

1091
00:58:53.862 --> 00:58:55.822
(Rooster crows)

1092
00:59:01.286 --> 00:59:02.287
Get out of your flight suit, mister.

1093
00:59:02.371 --> 00:59:05.040
-You're not going anywhere.
-What are you talking about??

1094
00:59:05.123 --> 00:59:07.125
This mission is too risky and too
important to let you screw it up.

1095
00:59:07.668 --> 00:59:08.752
You're not flying with US.

1096
00:59:08.835 --> 00:59:10.212
-Am too.
-Are not.

1097
00:59:10.629 --> 00:59:11.797
Am too.

1098
00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:14.132
(All ooh)

1099
00:59:14.758 --> 00:59:16.802
-Alright mister, let's go at it.
-Let's do it.

1100
00:59:16.885 --> 00:59:18.178
Get him. Come on.

1101
00:59:20.013 --> 00:59:21.098
-Get him!
-Come on!

1102
00:59:21.181 --> 00:59:23.100
(Mumbles)

1103
00:59:23.225 --> 00:59:24.726
(Mumbles)

1104
00:59:24.893 --> 00:59:26.853
(Mumbles)

1105
00:59:27.396 --> 00:59:28.480
What'd you say?

1106
00:59:28.564 --> 00:59:30.315
(Mumbles)

1107
00:59:33.068 --> 00:59:34.152
(All ooh)

1108
00:59:34.486 --> 00:59:36.154
God, my face!

1109
00:59:36.238 --> 00:59:37.406
My hand!

1110
00:59:38.407 --> 00:59:39.658
Attention on deck!

1111
00:59:41.326 --> 00:59:42.703
Be seated.

1112
00:59:47.249 --> 00:59:49.418
Well, gentlemen, we've waited
a long time to hear this.

1113
00:59:49.751 --> 00:59:52.087
In exactly 5 hours and 17 minutes,

1114
00:59:52.462 --> 00:59:53.755
we hit the enemy toast.

1115
00:59:54.339 --> 00:59:56.049
I think that's the enemy <i>coast, </i>sir.

1116
00:59:56.508 --> 00:59:57.968
Huh? Coast?

1117
01:00:00.095 --> 01:00:01.930
It'll take more planning,
but it doesn't matter.

1118
01:00:02.139 --> 01:00:03.265
Our assignment is to knock out

1119
01:00:03.348 --> 01:00:05.142
the nuclear weapons plant
at falafel heights.

1120
01:00:05.851 --> 01:00:08.520
The plant goes online in 12 hours
and is heavily defended.

1121
01:00:09.896 --> 01:00:12.274
If you have trouble
hitting your objective,

1122
01:00:12.357 --> 01:00:15.068
your secondary targets are here and here--

1123
01:00:15.652 --> 01:00:18.280
an accordion factory and a mime school.

1124
01:00:18.989 --> 01:00:20.157
Good luck, gentlemen.

1125
01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.783
Blake, take over.

1126
01:00:23.994 --> 01:00:24.995
There's one more thing...

1127
01:00:25.078 --> 01:00:26.121
(Ding)

1128
01:00:26.204 --> 01:00:28.123
Never mind, I'll get that.
It's probably for me.

1129
01:00:33.545 --> 01:00:35.255
Our sortie will proceed as planned.

1130
01:00:36.048 --> 01:00:38.634
I want topper Harley leading
our squadron into battle.

1131
01:00:38.717 --> 01:00:40.177
(Men murmuring) What?

1132
01:00:42.554 --> 01:00:43.805
Lieutenant commander, sir...

1133
01:00:44.306 --> 01:00:45.599
It's nothing personal.

1134
01:00:45.682 --> 01:00:47.392
I know I speak for every man here.

1135
01:00:48.101 --> 01:00:49.686
We've lost all respect for Harley.

1136
01:00:50.437 --> 01:00:51.730
He's poison for the morale of the unit

1137
01:00:52.481 --> 01:00:54.608
and a disaster to the
success of this mission.

1138
01:00:54.691 --> 01:00:56.151
You're out of line, Gregory.

1139
01:00:57.027 --> 01:00:58.403
You'll obey orders and like it.

1140
01:01:00.405 --> 01:01:02.074
Now get to your planes.

1141
01:01:13.168 --> 01:01:14.461
Sir.

1142
01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.296
What is it, Mr. Harley?

1143
01:01:17.089 --> 01:01:18.674
I hope I'm wrong about this.

1144
01:01:19.132 --> 01:01:20.217
What would that be?

1145
01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:23.178
Nobody likes playing for a coach
who throws the big game.

1146
01:01:24.262 --> 01:01:25.806
What's that supposed to mean?

1147
01:01:26.873 --> 01:01:29.059
My uncle used to tell me that not playing to win

1148
01:01:29.142 --> 01:01:30.435
is like sleeping with your sister.

1149
01:01:31.103 --> 01:01:32.562
Sure, she's a great piece of tail

1150
01:01:32.646 --> 01:01:34.940
with a blouseful of goodies,
but it's just illegal.

1151
01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.858
Jesus, topper, come on.

1152
01:01:36.942 --> 01:01:39.027
Then you get into that whole inbred thing.

1153
01:01:39.444 --> 01:01:41.405
Kids with no teeth who only play the banjo,

1154
01:01:41.488 --> 01:01:42.864
eat apple sauce through a straw,

1155
01:01:43.198 --> 01:01:44.324
pork farm animals.

1156
01:01:44.783 --> 01:01:45.992
Topper, that's enough.

1157
01:01:47.661 --> 01:01:49.329
I think you get my point, sir.

1158
01:01:49.621 --> 01:01:51.540
I just hope you're
playing straight with US.

1159
01:02:17.023 --> 01:02:18.692
(Dog yelps)

1160
01:02:27.993 --> 01:02:31.538
Alpha velveeta knuckle underwear,
you are cleared for takeoff.

1161
01:02:32.372 --> 01:02:33.999
<i>When you hit that nuclear weapons plant,</i>

1162
01:02:34.583 --> 01:02:36.251
<i>drop a bomb for me.</i>

1163
01:02:36.585 --> 01:02:39.504
Sphincter mucus niner ringworm, Roger.

1164
01:03:02.486 --> 01:03:04.529
(Woof woof woof woof)

1165
01:03:05.906 --> 01:03:06.948
Olé!

1166
01:03:24.132 --> 01:03:25.592
Yiii!

1167
01:03:33.683 --> 01:03:34.976
Oh.

1168
01:03:36.603 --> 01:03:39.189
Holy cow. My cap blew off.

1169
01:03:39.272 --> 01:03:40.357
Swing around, we'll pick it up.

1170
01:03:41.066 --> 01:03:42.275
But, sir, we're on the mission.

1171
01:03:44.361 --> 01:03:45.362
Good thinking.

1172
01:03:45.445 --> 01:03:46.655
Yeah. We'll pick it up on the way back.

1173
01:03:48.073 --> 01:03:49.282
We got to Mark the spot, though.

1174
01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:51.535
Put rabinowitz in a life raft,

1175
01:03:51.618 --> 01:03:53.036
have him row in circles until we return.

1176
01:03:53.787 --> 01:03:55.038
It could be days.

1177
01:03:55.997 --> 01:03:58.250
Then put some food in the life raft.

1178
01:03:58.333 --> 01:04:00.593
For god's sake man, do I have
to think of everything?

1179
01:04:00.794 --> 01:04:03.129
We'll tape his favorite shows.
He won't miss anything.

1180
01:04:03.213 --> 01:04:04.422
Sir, there's no time.

1181
01:04:04.506 --> 01:04:05.632
Okay, okay!

1182
01:04:06.341 --> 01:04:07.801
How can I be an admiral
without my cap?

1183
01:04:08.468 --> 01:04:09.469
It's out there somewhere all alone,

1184
01:04:09.594 --> 01:04:11.388
and I'm here powerless
to do anything about it.

1185
01:04:12.889 --> 01:04:14.349
<i>We're entering enemy air space.</i>

1186
01:04:18.812 --> 01:04:21.606
Sir, it appears we have
unidentified radar contacts.

1187
01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:23.775
Looks like enemy aircraft at 12:00.

1188
01:04:23.859 --> 01:04:25.569
Really? 12:00?

1189
01:04:25.652 --> 01:04:28.154
That gives US about 25 minutes.

1190
01:04:28.905 --> 01:04:30.073
Think I'll step out for a burger.

1191
01:04:36.663 --> 01:04:38.456
Sir, there are six of them,

1192
01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:40.208
bearing 2-1-5,

1193
01:04:40.292 --> 01:04:41.626
range 150 mi--

1194
01:04:42.419 --> 01:04:43.587
(sneezes)

1195
01:04:44.921 --> 01:04:47.048
Oh, my god.
A dozen more of them.

1196
01:04:47.549 --> 01:04:50.218
And a blimp!
A big, shiny blimp!

1197
01:04:50.302 --> 01:04:51.803
And it's slowly moving south!

1198
01:04:53.054 --> 01:04:55.181
Block, have you got
a tally on the bandits?

1199
01:04:55.557 --> 01:04:56.850
<i>Roger, that. I got them.</i>

1200
01:04:57.309 --> 01:04:59.102
Alright. Assume combat spread.

1201
01:04:59.185 --> 01:05:01.104
Attack formation delta niner.

1202
01:05:01.646 --> 01:05:02.731
<i>Topper in the lead.</i>

1203
01:05:03.356 --> 01:05:04.774
<i>Just like your old man, son.</i>

1204
01:05:05.984 --> 01:05:08.153
<i>Old buzz Harley would be</i>
<i>proud of you, topper.</i>

1205
01:05:10.488 --> 01:05:13.158
Kent's voice: <i>He's the type of guy that could</i>
<i>end up killing every man in this outfit.</i>

1206
01:05:13.241 --> 01:05:14.659
<i>He's poison for morale of the unit.</i>

1207
01:05:14.743 --> 01:05:17.537
President bush's voice:
<i>Read my lips--</i>

1208
01:05:17.621 --> 01:05:20.749
<i>no new taxes.</i>

1209
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.418
Topper, what are you doing?

1210
01:05:23.501 --> 01:05:25.295
He's frozen.
Topper's no good to US.

1211
01:05:26.338 --> 01:05:27.672
Abort the mission.

1212
01:05:27.756 --> 01:05:29.007
<i>Abort the mission.</i>

1213
01:05:29.758 --> 01:05:30.842
<i>Return to mother.</i>

1214
01:05:36.473 --> 01:05:38.183
We can't! They're all over US.

1215
01:05:39.267 --> 01:05:40.769
(Speaking foreign language)

1216
01:05:41.811 --> 01:05:43.355
(Speaking arabic gibberish)

1217
01:05:47.317 --> 01:05:48.735
(Speaking arabic gibberish)

1218
01:05:48.818 --> 01:05:51.154
Damn it! All right, engage! Engage!

1219
01:05:51.237 --> 01:05:52.656
I've got a bogey at 12:00 o'clock!

1220
01:05:55.575 --> 01:05:56.952
(Speaking foreign language)

1221
01:05:57.577 --> 01:05:59.654
I got two on my tail!
Kowalski, get them off me!

1222
01:06:03.249 --> 01:06:05.210
Locked up! Fox 2.

1223
01:06:06.294 --> 01:06:07.295
Shish kebab!

1224
01:06:09.547 --> 01:06:10.799
<i>My missile didn't track!</i>

1225
01:06:11.299 --> 01:06:12.342
<i>My engine's cut out!</i>

1226
01:06:12.425 --> 01:06:13.551
<i>I'm losing power!</i>

1227
01:06:15.845 --> 01:06:16.888
My cannons!

1228
01:06:16.972 --> 01:06:18.348
My cannons won't fire!
What's going on?

1229
01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:22.143
I've got 2 bandits on my 6:00!

1230
01:06:27.107 --> 01:06:28.191
This is insane.

1231
01:06:28.984 --> 01:06:29.985
Wilson and rosener.

1232
01:06:30.902 --> 01:06:32.070
<i>It was them, wasn't it?</i>

1233
01:06:32.821 --> 01:06:34.197
<i>They said nobody would get hurt.</i>

1234
01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:36.408
Block, call your men back.

1235
01:06:37.325 --> 01:06:38.660
Like hell I will.

1236
01:06:38.743 --> 01:06:41.246
<i>I got the best pilot in the world up here.</i>

1237
01:06:41.329 --> 01:06:43.623
<i>Topper. Topper, do you read me?</i>

1238
01:06:43.707 --> 01:06:45.709
<i>I was there 20 years ago.</i>

1239
01:06:46.126 --> 01:06:48.336
<i>I was there with your father</i>
<i>and mailman farnham.</i>

1240
01:06:49.379 --> 01:06:52.132
<i>I was an eyewitness.</i>
<i>You gotta listen to me, topper.</i>

1241
01:06:52.924 --> 01:06:54.634
<i>What they told you</i>
<i>about your dad is all wrong.</i>

1242
01:06:55.093 --> 01:06:56.094
Eject, mailman!

1243
01:06:56.177 --> 01:06:57.262
Eject!

1244
01:06:58.638 --> 01:06:59.973
I can't! My seat's jammed!

1245
01:07:00.306 --> 01:07:01.516
Nothing works!

1246
01:07:01.599 --> 01:07:02.767
Stay calm!

1247
01:07:02.851 --> 01:07:04.269
My harness is malfunctioning!

1248
01:07:04.352 --> 01:07:05.437
I'll get it!

1249
01:07:07.397 --> 01:07:08.648
Buzz, the nose!

1250
01:07:09.107 --> 01:07:10.150
The nose!

1251
01:07:11.151 --> 01:07:12.235
Oh!

1252
01:07:13.278 --> 01:07:14.362
Sit tight!

1253
01:07:15.321 --> 01:07:16.322
Whoa!

1254
01:07:16.406 --> 01:07:17.949
Whoa!

1255
01:07:18.033 --> 01:07:19.075
Come on!

1256
01:07:19.159 --> 01:07:21.953
Hurry!

1257
01:07:24.581 --> 01:07:25.915
Get the lead out!

1258
01:07:26.916 --> 01:07:28.376
It's gonna be okay!

1259
01:07:31.588 --> 01:07:33.715
Wow, that was sure close!

1260
01:07:34.507 --> 01:07:37.093
Buzz, get back here!

1261
01:07:39.888 --> 01:07:41.181
Whoa!

1262
01:07:42.098 --> 01:07:43.183
Oh!

1263
01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:46.811
(High-pitched voice)
I'm okay.

1264
01:07:47.771 --> 01:07:48.813
Buzz!

1265
01:07:48.897 --> 01:07:50.732
The wing! The wing!

1266
01:07:50.815 --> 01:07:52.108
Hurry!

1267
01:07:52.192 --> 01:07:54.319
Ooh. Ooh.

1268
01:07:55.028 --> 01:07:56.446
What, are you on a break?

1269
01:07:57.489 --> 01:07:58.865
Hurry!

1270
01:08:00.617 --> 01:08:02.035
I'm here!

1271
01:08:02.952 --> 01:08:04.537
Whose gum is this?

1272
01:08:04.621 --> 01:08:07.415
Oh, for god's sake.
Not now!

1273
01:08:12.003 --> 01:08:13.296
Got it!

1274
01:08:13.379 --> 01:08:15.632
Hold on!
We'll bring this baby down!

1275
01:08:15.715 --> 01:08:16.758
Stop squirming!

1276
01:08:17.509 --> 01:08:18.718
Hang on!

1277
01:08:20.011 --> 01:08:21.387
Whoa!

1278
01:08:21.471 --> 01:08:22.722
Those are my socks!

1279
01:08:23.807 --> 01:08:26.059
Buzz! Get back here!

1280
01:08:26.142 --> 01:08:30.188
<i>Your father did everything</i>
<i>humanly possible to save mailman's life.</i>

1281
01:08:30.271 --> 01:08:31.898
<i>You should be proud, son.</i>

1282
01:08:31.981 --> 01:08:34.567
<i>Buzz Harley is a true American hero.</i>

1283
01:08:38.905 --> 01:08:40.573
I'm hit! I'm hit!

1284
01:08:40.657 --> 01:08:41.908
Block, are you all right?

1285
01:08:41.991 --> 01:08:43.701
Yes! Yes!

1286
01:08:43.785 --> 01:08:45.036
Give them hell!

1287
01:08:46.121 --> 01:08:47.163
Got it.

1288
01:08:47.247 --> 01:08:50.333
This is for you, dad.

1289
01:08:52.085 --> 01:08:53.294
They're on my tail!

1290
01:08:53.378 --> 01:08:54.587
I'm with you, buddy.

1291
01:08:56.422 --> 01:08:57.549
Hang in there.

1292
01:09:01.719 --> 01:09:02.846
My guns are jammed.

1293
01:09:04.055 --> 01:09:05.140
They got tune on me!

1294
01:09:06.558 --> 01:09:08.268
Looks like, I'm gonna
have to do it the hard way.

1295
01:09:11.354 --> 01:09:12.397
<i>Anybody home?</i>

1296
01:09:14.566 --> 01:09:16.025
They fell for that one.

1297
01:09:17.026 --> 01:09:18.778
Topper, 3 bandits, 12:00.

1298
01:09:18.862 --> 01:09:20.405
I'm on 'em. They're all mine.

1299
01:09:24.325 --> 01:09:26.119
Here we go.
Loop-the-loop.

1300
01:09:26.244 --> 01:09:28.288
-Couscous!
-Swami says.

1301
01:09:29.414 --> 01:09:30.915
(Speaking arabic gibberish)

1302
01:09:31.457 --> 01:09:33.342
Learned this one from Paula Abdul.

1303
01:09:34.752 --> 01:09:36.754
(Speaking arabic gibberish)

1304
01:09:42.302 --> 01:09:44.137
Oldest trick in the book.

1305
01:09:50.476 --> 01:09:51.603
Catch me if you can, guys.

1306
01:09:52.353 --> 01:09:53.730
<i>This is an old buzz Harley move.</i>

1307
01:09:56.983 --> 01:09:58.109
<i>Oh, boys.</i>

1308
01:09:58.735 --> 01:09:59.736
Aah!

1309
01:10:01.279 --> 01:10:02.405
<i>I'm on their tails.</i>

1310
01:10:02.989 --> 01:10:04.073
I've got them now.

1311
01:10:08.912 --> 01:10:10.330
Hey, buddy.

1312
01:10:11.247 --> 01:10:12.999
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

1313
01:10:16.461 --> 01:10:18.463
It looks like they're bugging out.

1314
01:10:20.673 --> 01:10:21.758
Yike!

1315
01:10:24.010 --> 01:10:27.013
(Brakes screeching)

1316
01:10:29.933 --> 01:10:31.684
Saved by the clouds.

1317
01:10:31.768 --> 01:10:32.936
Come on in, boys.

1318
01:10:33.019 --> 01:10:34.479
(Speaking arabic gibberish)

1319
01:10:34.646 --> 01:10:35.855
A little hide-and-seek?

1320
01:10:37.357 --> 01:10:38.942
(Speaking arabic gibberish)

1321
01:10:43.446 --> 01:10:45.114
See you later, guys.

1322
01:10:46.908 --> 01:10:49.160
This could be the end
of a beautiful friendship.

1323
01:10:53.581 --> 01:10:54.749
<i>Topper, look out!</i>

1324
01:10:56.626 --> 01:10:58.962
I got two heat-seeking missiles
on my tail.

1325
01:11:00.004 --> 01:11:03.132
Block, Kent, Kowalski,
get the hell out of here!

1326
01:11:04.050 --> 01:11:05.134
Get back to the ship!

1327
01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:07.428
I've got a nuclear weapons plant to wax.

1328
01:11:08.137 --> 01:11:09.180
You're committing suicide!

1329
01:11:09.889 --> 01:11:10.890
Do as he says!

1330
01:11:14.185 --> 01:11:15.478
(Screeching)

1331
01:11:15.561 --> 01:11:16.646
They're close.

1332
01:11:17.355 --> 01:11:18.523
Missiles...

1333
01:11:18.606 --> 01:11:20.525
Still with me.
Come on.

1334
01:11:26.447 --> 01:11:28.533
If I can't lose them, I'll use them.

1335
01:11:30.368 --> 01:11:31.953
The mother of all targets.

1336
01:11:35.707 --> 01:11:37.709
Sayonara, Saddam.

1337
01:11:43.047 --> 01:11:44.215
Block: <i>Come in. Are you all right?</i>

1338
01:11:44.299 --> 01:11:46.134
<i>Topper, acknowledge! Acknowledge!</i>

1339
01:11:46.217 --> 01:11:47.468
<i>Topper, do you read?</i>

1340
01:11:47.552 --> 01:11:48.886
<i>Topper, are you all right?</i>

1341
01:11:55.893 --> 01:11:58.896
(Woof)

1342
01:12:01.149 --> 01:12:02.525
There they are.

1343
01:12:02.608 --> 01:12:05.028
(Applause)

1344
01:12:06.571 --> 01:12:07.572
<i>Uh, we're, uh, landing.</i>

1345
01:12:07.655 --> 01:12:09.365
<i>Do you want to get out of the way?</i>

1346
01:12:11.617 --> 01:12:13.036
Run for your life!

1347
01:12:25.882 --> 01:12:26.883
Where's topper?

1348
01:12:26.966 --> 01:12:28.009
Lost contact.

1349
01:12:35.016 --> 01:12:36.267
There he is!

1350
01:12:36.351 --> 01:12:37.935
<i>Pyrex pickle blow fish,</i>

1351
01:12:38.019 --> 01:12:39.187
<i>permission to land.</i>

1352
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:41.314
(Cheering)

1353
01:12:42.023 --> 01:12:43.566
<i>You guys are going</i>
<i>to have to talk me down.</i>

1354
01:12:43.649 --> 01:12:44.650
<i>I've got some damage.</i>

1355
01:12:44.734 --> 01:12:45.735
Wait. Hold it! Hold it!

1356
01:12:46.027 --> 01:12:47.070
Okay, topper.

1357
01:12:47.737 --> 01:12:49.572
-Ease her in.
-<i>Landing gear's frozen.</i>

1358
01:12:49.655 --> 01:12:50.656
Looking good.

1359
01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:51.783
<i>Lost my radar.</i>

1360
01:12:52.492 --> 01:12:53.951
A little more power now.

1361
01:12:54.035 --> 01:12:55.078
<i>I'm out of fuel.</i>

1362
01:12:55.161 --> 01:12:56.496
Right for line up.

1363
01:12:56.579 --> 01:12:57.622
<i>Lost a wing.</i>

1364
01:12:57.705 --> 01:12:58.748
Doing fine.

1365
01:12:58.831 --> 01:12:59.874
<i>There goes the other one.</i>

1366
01:12:59.957 --> 01:13:02.543
Okay topper, call the ball.

1367
01:13:02.627 --> 01:13:04.128
<i>Touching down.</i>

1368
01:13:10.134 --> 01:13:11.594
Whoo-hoo!

1369
01:13:12.261 --> 01:13:14.097
Yeah! Yeah!

1370
01:13:14.347 --> 01:13:16.015
Whoo!

1371
01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:17.892
Well done, Jim!
Well done!

1372
01:13:20.061 --> 01:13:21.270
Ehh, whoopsie.

1373
01:13:25.608 --> 01:13:27.110
You're quite a guy.

1374
01:13:27.193 --> 01:13:28.277
Ah, so are you.

1375
01:13:29.821 --> 01:13:31.572
Hey! Wash out!

1376
01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:33.866
Aw, topper.

1377
01:13:35.076 --> 01:13:36.285
(Crash)

1378
01:13:38.162 --> 01:13:39.205
You.

1379
01:13:40.248 --> 01:13:41.666
You.

1380
01:13:43.709 --> 01:13:45.878
Hey.

1381
01:13:46.921 --> 01:13:48.423
I got one question for you.

1382
01:13:48.506 --> 01:13:49.507
Shoot.

1383
01:13:49.841 --> 01:13:51.384
What is a chafing dish for?

1384
01:13:51.509 --> 01:13:53.136
Why, it's a traditional serving piece

1385
01:13:53.219 --> 01:13:55.621
used at cocktail parties and brunches
for keeping food warm.

1386
01:13:56.139 --> 01:13:57.598
I thought that was a crock-pot.

1387
01:13:58.099 --> 01:13:59.100
No, no, no.

1388
01:13:59.851 --> 01:14:00.893
That's for cooking all day.

1389
01:14:01.519 --> 01:14:02.728
A chafing dish...

1390
01:14:06.441 --> 01:14:07.525
All right!

1391
01:14:07.608 --> 01:14:08.651
Whoo!

1392
01:14:09.152 --> 01:14:10.278
Hey, topper Harley!

1393
01:14:10.361 --> 01:14:11.654
Now that you've killed the bad guy

1394
01:14:11.737 --> 01:14:13.489
and made the world safe for democracy,

1395
01:14:13.573 --> 01:14:16.242
how are you going to cash in on
your new-found fame?

1396
01:14:16.451 --> 01:14:17.535
I'm going to Disneyland.

1397
01:14:17.618 --> 01:14:21.038
(Cheering)

1398
01:14:24.542 --> 01:14:26.127
Very fortunate, commander block.

1399
01:14:26.210 --> 01:14:27.587
This man has your blood type.

1400
01:14:28.921 --> 01:14:30.965
Don't worry, sir.
After this transfusion,

1401
01:14:31.048 --> 01:14:32.216
you're going to be just fine.

1402
01:14:33.301 --> 01:14:35.761
I've only seen heroism
like that one other time.

1403
01:14:36.679 --> 01:14:40.266
Maybe you know the pilot--
Leland "buzz" Harley.

1404
01:14:41.976 --> 01:14:44.604
I've been carrying
this secret around for 20 years.

1405
01:14:45.813 --> 01:14:47.106
I never spoke up.

1406
01:14:48.232 --> 01:14:49.442
I wanted him to fail.

1407
01:14:50.401 --> 01:14:51.861
I wanted to be number one.

1408
01:14:53.696 --> 01:14:55.239
And I was in love with your mother.

1409
01:14:56.282 --> 01:14:57.992
It's not important now, sir.

1410
01:14:58.451 --> 01:15:00.661
Please, save your strength
for your court-martial.

1411
01:15:01.329 --> 01:15:03.164
Oh, topper, you had me pegged right.

1412
01:15:04.207 --> 01:15:05.666
I was throwing the big game.

1413
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:07.043
Ha ha ha ow!

1414
01:15:09.378 --> 01:15:11.214
I really thought we needed
that other airplane.

1415
01:15:12.715 --> 01:15:16.719
Now I realize that American planes
will always be superior

1416
01:15:16.802 --> 01:15:18.888
as long as there are
wonderful men like you

1417
01:15:18.971 --> 01:15:21.140
in the cockpit and German parts.

1418
01:15:22.558 --> 01:15:23.726

Well, that's my job.

1434

Ramada, you must put me out of your mind.

1446
01:17:34.857 --> 01:17:36.609
There's a certain fly-boy aboard that ship

1447
01:17:37.276 --> 01:17:38.653
that needs you far more than I.

1448

You must forget me.

1449
