1
00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:46.281
- Quack, quack.
- Look out!

2
00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:48.700
He singed my tail feathers.

3
00:02:49.786 --> 00:02:50.994
Yee-ha!

4
00:02:55.416 --> 00:02:57.251
All right, Buzz. That's enough of that.

5
00:03:01.923 --> 00:03:04.258
What did I just say?

6
00:03:04.592 --> 00:03:06.802
That is a good way to lose an eye, my friend.

7
00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:09.638
Hold it. We've got company at two o'clock.

8
00:03:10.306 --> 00:03:11.557
I got him, Mailman. Hang on.

9
00:03:13.101 --> 00:03:14.935
Here we go.

10
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.357
- Buzz, what is goin' on up there?
- Just movin' a road hog.

11
00:03:24.612 --> 00:03:27.906
- Knock it off! What kind of stunt was that?
- Just seein' what this baby can do.

12
00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:33.245
This bag of bones isn't rated past Mach two.

13
00:03:34.455 --> 00:03:38.375
- Mach one!
- The G-forces, Buzz! The G-forces!

14
00:03:38.543 --> 00:03:40.627
Mach two! Gotta push the envelope.

15
00:03:42.338 --> 00:03:44.214
Mach three!

16
00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.967
Buzz! We're tearing apart!

17
00:03:49.554 --> 00:03:53.557
I'm losin' control.
Eject, Mailman. Hit the silk!

18
00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:57.811
- I can't get out!
- What are you doing?

19
00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:00.564
Buzz! Get back here!

20
00:04:01.107 --> 00:04:03.650
OK. I've been in tougher scrapes than this.

21
00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:07.112
There's the ground. It looks hard. OK, trees.

22
00:04:07.238 --> 00:04:09.406
No! Oh. Mahogany. Ow!

23
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.742
Squirrel's nest. Bird. Ow! Pine.

24
00:04:11.826 --> 00:04:13.493
Ow! Oh, the ground.

25
00:04:14.162 --> 00:04:16.204
Oh... Oh...

26
00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.832
Oh, I made it.

27
00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:22.002
I made it! There is a God.

28
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.671
Hallelujaaaaaa!

29
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:29.217
Ow! Oh! Ouch! Ow!

30
00:04:33.014 --> 00:04:35.515
Oh, you're French, aren't you?

31
00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:37.684
Ah... yeah, just like that.

32
00:04:56.955 --> 00:04:59.039
- Hey, look! There's one!
- Uh-oh.

33
00:05:51.592 --> 00:05:53.802
Topper Harley?

34
00:05:54.137 --> 00:05:56.096
Once, perhaps.

35
00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.098
Now I am called Tukachinchilla.

36
00:05:58.933 --> 00:06:01.393
- What does it mean?
- Fluffy Bunny Feet.

37
00:06:04.564 --> 00:06:06.356
It's very nice.

38
00:06:06.482 --> 00:06:08.608
I'm Lieutenant Commander James Block.

39
00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:09.943
I knew your father Buzz.

40
00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:14.531
Until his incident, he was
the greatest pilot who ever lived.

41
00:06:17.785 --> 00:06:19.036
We need to talk.

42
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.800
The Navy wants...

43
00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:42.476
The Navy wants you back, Harley.

44
00:06:43.561 --> 00:06:46.646
They threw me out. Why should I go back?

45
00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:50.942
I came here to get away from the Navy.
Away from flying.

46
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.086
The Navy has
a top-secret mission: Sleepy Weasel.

47
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.255
I'm giving you a second chance,
which your father never had.

48
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.466
You're the best of the best, Topper.

49
00:07:17.011 --> 00:07:22.015
Leave me to speak with the
one. He is wise in the ways of such things.

50
00:07:26.395 --> 00:07:27.979
The Navy really needs you.

51
00:07:28.606 --> 00:07:29.981
Great helium!

52
00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:35.445
Owatonna.

53
00:07:37.448 --> 00:07:38.490
Owatonna!

54
00:08:23.244 --> 00:08:26.830
Every night I hope and pray

55
00:08:26.998 --> 00:08:30.417
A dream lover will come my way

56
00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:34.171
A girl to hold in my arms

57
00:08:34.255 --> 00:08:36.798
And know the magic of her charms

58
00:08:36.883 --> 00:08:39.092
- Because I want
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

59
00:08:39.177 --> 00:08:40.886
- A girl
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

60
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:42.762
- To call
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

61
00:08:42.847 --> 00:08:44.222
- My own
- Yeah-yeah

62
00:08:44.307 --> 00:08:46.516
I want a dream lover

63
00:08:46.601 --> 00:08:50.437
I don't have to dream alone

64
00:08:52.356 --> 00:08:55.692
Dream lover, until then

65
00:08:55.776 --> 00:08:59.196
I'll go to sleep, I'll dream again

66
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.991
That's the only thing to do

67
00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:05.994
Till all my lover's dreams come true

68
00:09:06.078 --> 00:09:08.288
- Because I want
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

69
00:09:08.372 --> 00:09:09.873
- A girl
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

70
00:09:09.957 --> 00:09:11.708
- To call
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

71
00:09:11.792 --> 00:09:13.084
- My own
- Yeah-yeah

72
00:09:13.169 --> 00:09:15.378
I want a dream lover

73
00:09:15.463 --> 00:09:19.257
I don't have to dream alone

74
00:09:21.469 --> 00:09:24.763
Dream lover, until then

75
00:09:24.847 --> 00:09:28.308
I'll go to sleep, I'll dream again

76
00:09:28.392 --> 00:09:32.062
That's the only thing to do

77
00:09:32.146 --> 00:09:35.023
Till all my lover's dreams come true

78
00:09:35.107 --> 00:09:37.067
- Because I want
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

79
00:09:37.151 --> 00:09:38.777
- A girl

80
00:09:38.861 --> 00:09:40.695

81
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.030
- My own
- Yeah-yeah

82
00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:44.491
I want a dream lover

83
00:09:44.575 --> 00:09:48.036
I don't have to dream alone

84
00:09:49.455 --> 00:09:51.164
Wow!

85
00:10:13.062 --> 00:10:15.105
Wha-hoo!

86
00:10:31.372 --> 00:10:33.456
Ten... hut!

87
00:10:44.635 --> 00:10:46.720
Admiral. Good to see you again, sir.

88
00:10:46.804 --> 00:10:49.431
- It's been too long.
- And so it has. Yes, yes.

89
00:10:49.515 --> 00:10:51.558
- How are ya, sir?
- Hawaii?

90
00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:55.979
- Goddamn it, Bill, I should be in California.
- No, sir, this is California.

91
00:10:56.063 --> 00:11:00.066
- Well, gotta run. Good luck.
- But, sir, this is your command.

92
00:11:00.484 --> 00:11:04.904
Sleepy Weasel has been planned for
ten months. The president hand-picked you.

93
00:11:04.989 --> 00:11:07.574
Damn right he did.
No stoppin' us now, huh, Ted?

94
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:13.288
- I'll show you your offices and brief you.
- You're a fine soldier, Scott. Lead the way.

95
00:11:13.414 --> 00:11:15.457
Oh, good God. I gotta pee.

96
00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:18.501
I had part of my bladder
blown off at Guadalcanal.

97
00:11:19.211 --> 00:11:21.921
Watch your step.
There's a lot of obstructions here.

98
00:11:22.798 --> 00:11:25.759
- I had a little dreidel!
- I made it out of clay!

99
00:11:25.843 --> 00:11:29.471
- And when it's dry and ready...
- My dreidel I will play!

100
00:11:29.555 --> 00:11:32.474
- Here's the story...
- Of a lovely lady!

101
00:11:32.558 --> 00:11:35.852
- Who was bringing up...
- Three very lovely girls!

102
00:11:35.936 --> 00:11:38.813
- All of them had hair of gold!
- Like their mother!

103
00:11:38.898 --> 00:11:41.358
- The youngest one...
- In curls!

104
00:11:41.442 --> 00:11:43.693
- Here's the story...
- Of a man named Brady!

105
00:11:53.496 --> 00:11:55.580
Gentlemen, he's back.

106
00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.584
How ya been?

107
00:12:00.711 --> 00:12:03.338
- Yeah, it's the big guy.
- Good to see ya.

108
00:12:03.464 --> 00:12:06.341
- Scooter! How you doin'?
- Topper. The main man.

109
00:12:07.343 --> 00:12:10.428
- Rabbi! Mazel tov.
- You should live and be well!

110
00:12:28.364 --> 00:12:30.323
Hey, buddy.

111
00:12:30.408 --> 00:12:32.283
Are you OK?

112
00:12:32.368 --> 00:12:34.744
You don't look so hot. You need some help?

113
00:12:34.829 --> 00:12:36.871
I'm OK.

114
00:12:38.124 --> 00:12:40.083
You're Topper Harley, aren't you?

115
00:12:40.167 --> 00:12:44.421
I hear you've got chops we only dream of.
Throwin' you out was a bum rap.

116
00:12:44.588 --> 00:12:47.757
I'm Jim Pfaffenbach.
Everybody calls me Wash Out.

117
00:12:49.427 --> 00:12:52.929
- You're a pilot?
- Oh, yeah. I'm gonna be flyin' with ya.

118
00:12:54.181 --> 00:12:56.099
Good.

119
00:12:57.017 --> 00:12:58.143
Phew.

120
00:13:03.607 --> 00:13:04.691
Cute.

121
00:13:06.026 --> 00:13:08.361
I like to stay in shape. Thanks.

122
00:13:08.529 --> 00:13:10.780
- Are these all at home?
- Yeah.

123
00:13:11.198 --> 00:13:13.700
The dogs, wife and kids.

124
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.203
You got pictures of your family,
I'd love to see 'em.

125
00:13:18.122 --> 00:13:22.375
- I am my family photo.
- But everybody needs a family to love.

126
00:13:23.043 --> 00:13:28.006
I could never find time for love. It's
too heavy. It's an anchor that drowns a man.

127
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:31.926
Besides, I got the sky,
the smell of jet exhaust, my bike.

128
00:13:32.011 --> 00:13:33.887
- A loner?
- No. I own it.

129
00:13:35.681 --> 00:13:38.391
I can see I'm gonna have to work on you.

130
00:13:38.476 --> 00:13:40.602
Name's Pete Thompson. But...

131
00:13:42.229 --> 00:13:44.522
...everybody calls me Dead Meat.

132
00:13:45.024 --> 00:13:47.192
- Topper Harley.
- Just a pleasure.

133
00:13:51.697 --> 00:13:53.865
Attention on deck!

134
00:13:55.242 --> 00:13:57.285
Good morning, sir!

135
00:13:58.662 --> 00:14:01.247
I don't care how many missions you've flown!

136
00:14:01.332 --> 00:14:05.543
I don't care how good you think you are!
You're nobody!

137
00:14:05.753 --> 00:14:09.839
And for the next ten days,
nobody takes a crap unless I say so!

138
00:14:09.924 --> 00:14:12.425
- Got it?
- Yes, sir!

139
00:14:13.427 --> 00:14:15.136
I said "Attention".

140
00:14:15.804 --> 00:14:19.265
Now, didn't I make myself clear?
Or don't you take orders?

141
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.685
- When I say "Attention", I mean "Attention".
- Yes, sir!

142
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:24.270
Now!

143
00:14:31.111 --> 00:14:34.197
- You eyeballin' me, mister?
- No, sir!

144
00:14:34.281 --> 00:14:39.118
The next time I see that ugly face of yours,
I want it clean-shaven! Suck in that chest!

145
00:14:43.624 --> 00:14:44.999
Pfaffenbach!

146
00:14:47.711 --> 00:14:50.880
- What you lookin' at, boy?
- Nothin', sir!

147
00:14:50.965 --> 00:14:54.300
Oh, I'm some lowlife that's
not good enough for you to talk to?

148
00:14:54.385 --> 00:14:59.013
Well, that attitude is short on collateral!
I'm God as far as you're concerned!

149
00:14:59.139 --> 00:15:00.640
Hey, hey. Lighten up.

150
00:15:01.976 --> 00:15:03.726
Cut the kid some slack.

151
00:15:05.646 --> 00:15:07.313
Who the hell are you talkin' to, son?

152
00:15:08.649 --> 00:15:11.317
Your ego's writin' cheques your body can't cash.

153
00:15:11.527 --> 00:15:13.945
Now you got five minutes to stow your gear.

154
00:15:14.029 --> 00:15:15.405
Get movin'!

155
00:15:18.492 --> 00:15:21.202
Yeah, I'm sure deep down he means well.

156
00:15:23.831 --> 00:15:25.790
I hope you were paying attention.

157
00:15:25.874 --> 00:15:29.502
- I don't think we've met.
- Kent Gregory.

158
00:15:29.587 --> 00:15:31.588
Excuse me if I don't shake your hand.

159
00:15:31.672 --> 00:15:37.218
Your father killed someone very special
to me: Dominic "Mailman" Farnham.

160
00:15:37.303 --> 00:15:38.970
- You mean...
- Yes.

161
00:15:39.054 --> 00:15:41.806
Dominic Farnham was my father.
I was his love child.

162
00:15:42.683 --> 00:15:45.643
- It was a hunting accident.
- Accident, my deep-blue eyes.

163
00:15:45.894 --> 00:15:49.147
It was reckless, irresponsible flying,
and you know it.

164
00:15:49.231 --> 00:15:50.607
Are you OK?

165
00:15:51.692 --> 00:15:53.943
This is an incredible coincidence,

166
00:15:54.028 --> 00:15:55.945
but the hunter who mistakenly killed your father

167
00:16:00.909 --> 00:16:04.120
was Henry Pfaffenbach, my father.

168
00:16:06.248 --> 00:16:07.874
I feel terrible.

169
00:16:08.459 --> 00:16:10.877
Isn't this Henry Alva Pfaffenbach?

170
00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:13.755
My mother was a Pfaffenbach.

171
00:16:14.131 --> 00:16:16.758
Not... Doreen Pfaffenbach?

172
00:16:17.051 --> 00:16:18.968
- From Minnesota?
- Yeah.

173
00:16:19.553 --> 00:16:23.056
Then we're cousins! We used to
spend our summers in Eagle River.

174
00:16:23.307 --> 00:16:25.099
Eagle River?

175
00:16:25.434 --> 00:16:27.935
I hope you can forgive me for this.

176
00:16:29.563 --> 00:16:32.065
If it helps, I didn't have seconds.

177
00:16:33.108 --> 00:16:37.654
That's all right. It's not your fault.
Anyone could have made that mistake.

178
00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:42.659
But him... he's the type that could
end up killing every man in this outfit.

179
00:16:42.993 --> 00:16:46.746
Wait a minute. Why are you mad at me?
He's the one who ate your father.

180
00:16:48.582 --> 00:16:51.751
Like father, like son.
You've already been tossed out once.

181
00:16:52.419 --> 00:16:54.045
Hold it, hold it.

182
00:16:54.588 --> 00:16:58.424
We can't fight among ourselves.
We're all on the same team here.

183
00:16:58.759 --> 00:17:01.386
I want the two of you to shake hands.

184
00:17:05.933 --> 00:17:08.434
There, now. Isn't that better?

185
00:17:09.019 --> 00:17:10.645
- Yeah.
- Sure.

186
00:17:13.273 --> 00:17:14.982
There. We're friends again.

187
00:17:16.193 --> 00:17:18.820
Here. Have some of my lucky gum.

188
00:17:20.155 --> 00:17:24.534
Look, Dead Meat. We fly together,
we sleep next to each other, but that's all.

189
00:17:24.952 --> 00:17:28.121
Don't get too close.
Let me handle my own affairs.

190
00:17:31.959 --> 00:17:33.543
He's so complex.

191
00:17:36.004 --> 00:17:39.173
Aerial photos and recon reports
indicate a defensive arsenal

192
00:17:39.258 --> 00:17:41.467
in the D, and perhaps -C, categories.

193
00:17:41.552 --> 00:17:43.970
There's also some anti-aircraft squadrons.

194
00:17:44.054 --> 00:17:48.391
They can send up an ack-ack umbrella
high enough to make any attack ineffective.

195
00:17:48.475 --> 00:17:51.728
I don't have a clue
what you're talkin' about, Phil.

196
00:17:51.812 --> 00:17:55.732
I have a shell the size of a fist in my head
Pork Chop Hill.

197
00:17:55.816 --> 00:17:57.775
The only way I can make this toup stay on

198
00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.446
is by magnetising the upper left
quadrant of my skull.

199
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.741
You just go ahead and do what you do.
Do you have any soup?

200
00:18:04.825 --> 00:18:08.327
Of course, sir. I'll have the mess
bring something right up.

201
00:18:08.412 --> 00:18:11.164
I love soup. I mean, I think I love soup.

202
00:18:11.248 --> 00:18:14.792
Son-of-a-bitchin' shell. It's either
soup or duck. Which one do you shoot?

203
00:18:14.918 --> 00:18:16.043
Duck, sir.

204
00:18:18.297 --> 00:18:21.048
- Are you all right, sir?
- Of course I'm all right.

205
00:18:21.133 --> 00:18:22.675
Why? What have you heard?

206
00:18:24.052 --> 00:18:25.511
Nothing, sir.

207
00:18:25.763 --> 00:18:27.972
Send some soup up for the admiral,
on the double.

208
00:18:28.056 --> 00:18:31.684
Let's go over this Slippery Weevil
one more time.

209
00:18:31.769 --> 00:18:37.273
I wanna familiarise myself with it as much
as I possibly can. So... give it to me, Ben.

210
00:18:37.357 --> 00:18:39.442
Every word. Every detail.

211
00:18:39.526 --> 00:18:41.110
Dot every comma.

212
00:19:23.028 --> 00:19:24.779
Those are some long legs.

213
00:19:25.364 --> 00:19:29.075
I just had them lengthened.
Now they go all the way up.

214
00:19:29.493 --> 00:19:30.576
Wow.

215
00:19:30.828 --> 00:19:32.078
It's nice to see you again.

216
00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.498
I was really impressed,
the way you handled that stallion.

217
00:19:35.582 --> 00:19:40.503
When I saw you dig your heels into his sides
tighten the reins and break his spirit,

218
00:19:40.587 --> 00:19:42.547
I never wanted to be a horse so much in my life.

219
00:19:43.632 --> 00:19:47.218
After I finish off this shrink,
we can take a quick canter in the meadow.

220
00:19:47.636 --> 00:19:49.428
Lieutenant, I am the shrink.

221
00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:54.183
- You're the psychiatrist?
- That's what the diploma says.

222
00:19:54.268 --> 00:19:57.645
I've never been to a psychiatrist before.
You will be gentle?

223
00:20:01.233 --> 00:20:03.526
I've been ordered to review your records.

224
00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:08.322
You were discharged from the service
18 months ago for wilful insubordination.

225
00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:14.370
You disobeyed a direct order
and lost a $13m fighter in the process.

226
00:20:14.454 --> 00:20:18.249
Yes, I did. But I'm payin' it off
at ten bucks a week.

227
00:20:18.333 --> 00:20:21.627
I should have gotten
that extra collision coverage.

228
00:20:22.296 --> 00:20:24.881
Wasn't your father involved
in a similar incident?

229
00:20:25.257 --> 00:20:28.050
- What do you mean?
- Leland "Buzz" Harley.

230
00:20:28.135 --> 00:20:31.053
Three Purple Hearts, presidential commendation.

231
00:20:31.138 --> 00:20:33.598
Then this incident, the Dominic Farnham death.

232
00:20:33.974 --> 00:20:36.976
1971, his Visa card was cancelled.

233
00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.353
1975, a broken man,

234
00:20:39.438 --> 00:20:42.648
suffocated while working
the night shift in a Fotomat booth.

235
00:20:45.027 --> 00:20:46.903
Tell me how these events affected you.

236
00:20:49.072 --> 00:20:51.365
Well, I... I don't think about it much.

237
00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:54.452
That was a long time ago.

238
00:20:54.828 --> 00:20:57.163
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have some guns to grease.

239
00:20:58.165 --> 00:20:59.457
Lieutenant...

240
00:20:59.541 --> 00:21:02.668
Have you thought about
seeing a psychiatrist on a regular basis?

241
00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.171
I thought you'd never ask.

242
00:21:05.505 --> 00:21:06.923
I mean professionally.

243
00:21:09.176 --> 00:21:10.718
Thanks, Doctor.

244
00:21:11.511 --> 00:21:13.346
Thanks for the advice.

245
00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.974
- Be careful out there.
- I can take care of myself.

246
00:21:17.142 --> 00:21:21.020
- No. You're going to get hurt.
- I don't need your help, or anybody's.

247
00:21:21.104 --> 00:21:22.438
I'll be just fine.

248
00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:28.861
Are you OK?

249
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:37.161
Yeah. I'm fine.

250
00:21:39.873 --> 00:21:41.832
Oh...

251
00:21:44.503 --> 00:21:46.170
Attention on deck.

252
00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:47.922
At ease, men.

253
00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.302
Be seated.

254
00:21:56.056 --> 00:22:00.768
Many of you are wondering about my pants.
Well, they ran short of material at the knee.

255
00:22:00.852 --> 00:22:02.895
So don't give me any shit.

256
00:22:03.647 --> 00:22:07.233
Now, I look out there
at all of you guys and I say to myself:

257
00:22:07.317 --> 00:22:10.653
What I wouldn't give to be 20 years younger,

258
00:22:10.737 --> 00:22:11.862
and a woman.

259
00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:18.327
You know, I've flown over 194 missions,
and I was shot down on every one.

260
00:22:18.412 --> 00:22:22.748
Come to think of it, I've never
landed a plane in my life. Now,

261
00:22:22.833 --> 00:22:27.044
you men'll be piloting the backbone
of our proud American arsenal:

262
00:22:27.129 --> 00:22:31.298
The Oscar EW 5894 Phallus
tactical fighter bomber.

263
00:22:31.383 --> 00:22:35.636
Its lightweight sweptwing design
makes it extremely manoeuvrable and agile.

264
00:22:35.721 --> 00:22:41.684
Beneath its 21st-century skin is a highly
advanced avionics and weapons package.

265
00:22:41.768 --> 00:22:44.395
Designed for speed and combat acrobatics,

266
00:22:44.479 --> 00:22:49.442
it features the latest Mrs Halver
series 3800 radar-jamming Framus.

267
00:22:51.945 --> 00:22:53.696
- Admiral.
- Nurse.

268
00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:58.200
Sleepy Weasel's success depends
on our manoeuvring below enemy radar.

269
00:22:58.285 --> 00:23:02.538
I wanna see a major display of low-level
flying. Topper, Kent, you're up first.

270
00:23:02.622 --> 00:23:06.042
- Show me what you can do.
- Copy that, Purple Fluffer Nutter.

271
00:23:06.126 --> 00:23:08.127
Roger that, Milli Vanilli Chilly Willy.

272
00:23:11.423 --> 00:23:16.635
Bring 'em down, boys. I want your bellies to
scrape the sagebrush. Let's see who's best.

273
00:23:16.762 --> 00:23:19.013
I'm heading for the canyon floor.

274
00:23:24.061 --> 00:23:27.563
- For your information, I'm at 150 feet.
- I'm at 3rd and Main.

275
00:23:36.823 --> 00:23:39.617
Very pretty,
but enough hot-dogging, Harley.

276
00:23:39.951 --> 00:23:41.786
Just checkin' the traffic.

277
00:23:47.459 --> 00:23:50.336
- How'd I do, big fella?
- Don't get me started, Harley.

278
00:23:50.462 --> 00:23:53.756
Cut the chatter. Topper,
that was vintage Buzz Harley.

279
00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.342
You and your dad are two of a kind.

280
00:23:56.468 --> 00:23:59.011
Your ego's writin' cheques your body can't cash.

281
00:24:02.682 --> 00:24:04.850
Topper! Get back in formation!

282
00:24:10.524 --> 00:24:11.899
Topper, you weren't clear to detach.

283
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:19.281
- What was that all about?
- I, uh... thought I saw Elvis.

284
00:24:19.783 --> 00:24:22.201
Let it go, Topper.
The King is gone. Let's head for home.

285
00:24:34.047 --> 00:24:35.381
Not again!

286
00:24:36.383 --> 00:24:40.636
I need a landing clearance
for runway 30... 30 something.

287
00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.223
30-thirty-something's been cancelled.
Go to runway 2-niner.

288
00:24:48.019 --> 00:24:49.687
Wash Out, what the hell
are you doin'? Pull it up.

289
00:24:53.066 --> 00:24:57.987
Wash Out, where the hell are you?
What is your location? You're off of radar.

290
00:24:58.071 --> 00:24:59.572
Repeat: What is your location?

291
00:24:59.656 --> 00:25:02.700
It's not unusual to be loved by anyone

292
00:25:07.747 --> 00:25:09.582
- Goin' up?
- Yes.

293
00:25:19.926 --> 00:25:21.594
Can I press your button?

294
00:25:21.678 --> 00:25:26.098
No, you've been slavin' over hot psychotics
all day. Let me get that.

295
00:25:32.022 --> 00:25:35.691
- Interesting perfume.
- It's Vicks. I have a cold.

296
00:25:35.775 --> 00:25:36.817
Ah.

297
00:25:38.612 --> 00:25:41.071
Lieutenant, you're staring.

298
00:25:41.156 --> 00:25:44.033
No, not really. I'm lost in your eyes.

299
00:25:45.118 --> 00:25:49.955
That is the whitest white part of the eye
I've ever seen. Do you floss?

300
00:25:50.415 --> 00:25:52.291
You're very confident, aren't you?

301
00:25:52.876 --> 00:25:56.545
When you have 10,000 pounds of thrust
at your command, you have to be.

302
00:25:57.005 --> 00:26:00.633
Lieutenant, please.
I'm talking to you as a psychiatrist.

303
00:26:02.427 --> 00:26:05.054
I'm recommending that you be grounded.

304
00:26:05.931 --> 00:26:09.350
- You've got to be joking.
- If I were joking, I'd have said...

305
00:26:09.434 --> 00:26:11.393
"What do you do
with an elephant with three balls?"

306
00:26:12.562 --> 00:26:14.271
"You walk him and pitch to the rhino."

307
00:26:15.607 --> 00:26:19.485
- You are serious.
- It's the best thing for you, and the mission.

308
00:26:19.569 --> 00:26:23.030
The best would be
if you'd stop tryin' to run my life.

309
00:26:23.114 --> 00:26:25.908
I'm a pilot, and nobody's gonna
keep me out of the sky.

310
00:26:29.371 --> 00:26:32.456
Ladies and gentlemen!
Twelve rounds of boxing

311
00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:36.919
for the WBA WBC WPA RSVP

312
00:26:37.003 --> 00:26:40.005
Heavyweight Championship of the World!

313
00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:43.342
Introducing celebrities at ringside,

314
00:26:43.426 --> 00:26:47.346
please welcome His Holiness,
the very popular pontiff,

315
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:51.350
Pope John Paul II!

316
00:26:51.434 --> 00:26:52.685
Second!

317
00:26:56.523 --> 00:26:59.441
Lieutenant Commander Block.
We meet at last.

318
00:26:59.526 --> 00:27:04.154
- Isn't this place a little public?
- No, a crowd offers remarkable anonymity.

319
00:27:05.198 --> 00:27:07.241
How are we doing at Dudley?

320
00:27:07.325 --> 00:27:09.451
Oh, we're right on schedule.

321
00:27:09.703 --> 00:27:11.203
Can't quite get a reading on Admiral Benson,

322
00:27:11.288 --> 00:27:14.623
but Topper Harley's playing into our hands.

323
00:27:14.708 --> 00:27:19.211
Here's his evaluation. A clear-cut case
of Paternal Conflict Syndrome.

324
00:27:19.629 --> 00:27:21.463
Ah, yes. PCS.

325
00:27:21.548 --> 00:27:26.051
I saw an Afterschool Special on that.
They're years away from a vaccine.

326
00:27:26.177 --> 00:27:29.805
Every time I mention Buzz's name,
Topper goes off.

327
00:27:29.889 --> 00:27:32.683
There's no way the unit will function,
and I'll abort the mission.

328
00:27:34.144 --> 00:27:39.440
The Navy's planes will seem inferior and
the president will beg for my superfighter.

329
00:27:40.108 --> 00:27:42.693
And, best of all, nobody gets hurt.

330
00:27:42.777 --> 00:27:45.112
Well done, Lieutenant Commander.

331
00:27:45.739 --> 00:27:49.575
America can't afford to fall behind,
Mr Wilson. We need your plane.

332
00:27:50.577 --> 00:27:53.078
This should be a good match.
Both men work for Don King.

333
00:27:58.126 --> 00:28:01.086
Well, fans, that's it.

334
00:28:01.171 --> 00:28:03.797
Good night. I'm outta here!

335
00:28:04.966 --> 00:28:08.802
The Strafing Run
proudly presents Lawrence Lipps!

336
00:28:08.887 --> 00:28:11.013
And now...

337
00:28:11.348 --> 00:28:12.639
What the world needs

338
00:28:12.724 --> 00:28:13.932
Thank you!

339
00:28:14.017 --> 00:28:15.017
Is love

340
00:28:15.101 --> 00:28:16.268
Thank you so much!

341
00:28:16.436 --> 00:28:20.856
That's the only thing
that there's just too darn little of

342
00:28:30.033 --> 00:28:32.117
Ramada?

343
00:28:32.619 --> 00:28:34.953
- Kent!
- Ramada!

344
00:28:35.872 --> 00:28:38.791
Qu'est-ce que je suis contente de te revoir.

345
00:28:39.459 --> 00:28:42.002
Argh! My eyes!

346
00:28:42.087 --> 00:28:44.963
Darling, I thought you were still in Brussel.

347
00:28:45.048 --> 00:28:47.633
Oh, Kent. We were only hurting each other.

348
00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:49.259
I thought that's the way you wanted it.

349
00:28:51.304 --> 00:28:56.517
Something's changed. It's not another
woman, is it? I couldn't compete with that.

350
00:28:56.601 --> 00:28:58.811
No, of course you couldn't.

351
00:28:59.521 --> 00:29:03.982
Well, what matters is that you're here.
We've a lot of catching up to do.

352
00:29:04.067 --> 00:29:07.277
Wonderful. Just let me
take care of something.

353
00:29:07.404 --> 00:29:10.155
- Don't be long, mon amour.
- Absolument.

354
00:29:24.796 --> 00:29:27.297
Some day he'll come along

355
00:29:28.299 --> 00:29:30.342
The man I love

356
00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:33.262
And he'll be big and strong

357
00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:35.973
The man I love

358
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:39.601
And when he comes my way

359
00:29:40.019 --> 00:29:42.062
I'll do my best

360
00:29:42.522 --> 00:29:46.608
To make... him... stay

361
00:29:49.696 --> 00:29:52.197
He'll look at me and smile

362
00:29:53.032 --> 00:29:55.534
I'll understand

363
00:29:56.202 --> 00:29:58.495
And in a little while

364
00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.081
He'll take my hand

365
00:30:02.375 --> 00:30:05.002
And though it seems absurd

366
00:30:05.336 --> 00:30:11.717
I know we both... won't say... a... word

367
00:30:12.802 --> 00:30:14.428
Wow!

368
00:30:15.513 --> 00:30:17.347
Anybody here from out of town?

369
00:30:18.057 --> 00:30:21.393
Welcome. Nice to see you.

370
00:30:24.063 --> 00:30:28.400
Maybe I shall meet him someday

371
00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.487
Maybe Monday

372
00:30:32.197 --> 00:30:34.364
Maybe not

373
00:30:36.993 --> 00:30:40.412
Still I'm sure to meet him one day

374
00:30:41.581 --> 00:30:43.624
Maybe Tuesday

375
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.212
Will be my good-news day

376
00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:04.228
We'll build a little home

377
00:31:04.312 --> 00:31:06.897
Just meant for two

378
00:31:07.273 --> 00:31:10.025
From which I'll never roam

379
00:31:10.443 --> 00:31:12.945
Who would? Would you?

380
00:31:13.446 --> 00:31:16.114
And so all else above

381
00:31:16.616 --> 00:31:18.659
I'm dreaming of

382
00:31:18.743 --> 00:31:23.872
The man... I... love

383
00:31:24.082 --> 00:31:27.042
One day he'll come along

384
00:31:28.127 --> 00:31:30.003
He'll be big and strong

385
00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:33.257
And when he comes my way

386
00:31:33.341 --> 00:31:36.385
I'll do my best to make him stay

387
00:31:36.469 --> 00:31:40.472
And so all else above

388
00:31:40.557 --> 00:31:42.599
I'm dreamin' of

389
00:31:42.684 --> 00:31:44.684
The man I love

390
00:32:00.243 --> 00:32:02.327
- Ramada...
- Oh, no.

391
00:32:02.912 --> 00:32:05.998
Well, if it isn't God's gift to the cockpit.

392
00:32:07.166 --> 00:32:11.503
- Kent, your nostrils are flaring.
- That flying stunt today was pure madness.

393
00:32:11.588 --> 00:32:15.090
If a lady wasn't present,
I'd tear you apart like a Christmas goose.

394
00:32:15.341 --> 00:32:18.677
Yeah? Keep it up, you'll be carrying
your face home in a doggy bag.

395
00:32:18.928 --> 00:32:20.304
What is this macho thing?

396
00:32:21.347 --> 00:32:22.848
- He started it.
- Did not.

397
00:32:23.349 --> 00:32:24.558
- Did too.
- Did not.

398
00:32:24.642 --> 00:32:27.352
- You're behaving like children.
- He's a jerk.

399
00:32:27.437 --> 00:32:29.021
- Am not.
- Are too.

400
00:32:29.105 --> 00:32:30.981
- Am not.
- Are too too too...

401
00:32:31.065 --> 00:32:32.691
- Not not not...
...too too too...

402
00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:34.484
Are too times ten.

403
00:32:35.153 --> 00:32:37.029
- That's it.
- Stop it.

404
00:32:37.113 --> 00:32:38.697
- Rumble!
- Don't push me.

405
00:32:47.707 --> 00:32:51.418
Stop it! Can't you act
like civilised human beings?

406
00:32:51.544 --> 00:32:54.171
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- I love you, pal.

407
00:32:57.133 --> 00:33:01.219
Listen. Kent and I have to talk, so please...

408
00:33:02.305 --> 00:33:03.722
Be my guest.

409
00:33:13.399 --> 00:33:15.317
Let's celebrate, honey.

410
00:33:15.818 --> 00:33:17.653
Hey, everybody. Drinks are on me.

411
00:33:17.737 --> 00:33:19.488
- Free beer!
- I want a gin sling!

412
00:33:31.167 --> 00:33:33.960
You haven't forgotten my offer, have you?

413
00:33:34.379 --> 00:33:38.173
Little house in the country,
white picket fence, StairMaster.

414
00:33:38.591 --> 00:33:41.218
Kent, you're everything
a woman could possibly want.

415
00:33:42.303 --> 00:33:45.263
But I'm just not ready for marriage. Not yet.

416
00:33:46.724 --> 00:33:50.352
Well, I have to get back to the base.
Tomorrow's an important flight.

417
00:33:50.603 --> 00:33:52.938
You know how puffy my eyes get
when I don't get enough rest.

418
00:33:56.484 --> 00:33:57.859
Good night.

419
00:34:02.824 --> 00:34:03.990
May I?

420
00:34:05.493 --> 00:34:08.870
- Shouldn't you be getting back to the base?
- I suppose,

421
00:34:08.955 --> 00:34:11.248
if I played life by the rules,
but you know I don't.

422
00:34:12.458 --> 00:34:15.335
All right. You can walk me to my apartment.

423
00:34:17.964 --> 00:34:21.007
I shouldn't have gotten mad
in the elevator today.

424
00:34:21.092 --> 00:34:23.760
But when I want something that bad,
I get all fired up.

425
00:34:24.512 --> 00:34:27.973
Maybe that's why I worry so.
Maybe more than I should.

426
00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:31.268
Something terrible could happen.
You must...

427
00:34:32.729 --> 00:34:34.688
- But I...
- Don't worry.

428
00:34:35.815 --> 00:34:37.733
Everything will be fine. I promise.

429
00:34:38.401 --> 00:34:39.943
Boy, I hope so.

430
00:34:47.452 --> 00:34:49.077
Well, this is it.

431
00:34:51.164 --> 00:34:53.915
- It's a nice place.
- It's OK.

432
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.877
The only problem is I have a nosy landlady.

433
00:34:59.756 --> 00:35:01.673
Well, I guess this is good night.

434
00:35:02.717 --> 00:35:04.342
I don't wanna go back.

435
00:35:05.845 --> 00:35:07.512
You don't have to.

436
00:35:07.847 --> 00:35:09.848
I don't want to be alone.

437
00:35:10.266 --> 00:35:13.727
And, by the way,
I can go all night like a lumberjack.

438
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.982
What about your landlady?

439
00:35:19.066 --> 00:35:20.233
You can do her, too.

440
00:35:36.209 --> 00:35:39.169
So, I take it you've been with a man before.

441
00:35:40.546 --> 00:35:42.005
I'm a virgin.

442
00:35:42.799 --> 00:35:44.800
I'm just not very good at it.

443
00:36:53.369 --> 00:36:54.452
Ooh!

444
00:37:07.174 --> 00:37:08.216
Ah!

445
00:37:17.852 --> 00:37:20.312
Yes. Oh, yes...

446
00:37:36.287 --> 00:37:38.580
Ah! Topper...

447
00:37:51.344 --> 00:37:52.427
Oh...

448
00:38:15.201 --> 00:38:16.493
Wash Out!

449
00:38:18.579 --> 00:38:21.289
Get into your flight suit.
We're ready to go up.

450
00:38:21.791 --> 00:38:25.210
I got kicked out.
My flight status has been withdrawn.

451
00:38:25.294 --> 00:38:26.378
I'm through, Dead Meat.

452
00:38:26.545 --> 00:38:30.465
- What happened?
- It's my eyes. I've got walleye vision.

453
00:38:33.678 --> 00:38:38.306
- Can't something be done?
- A delicate corneal inversion procedure.

454
00:38:38.391 --> 00:38:39.975
A multioptipupiloptomy.

455
00:38:40.059 --> 00:38:41.851
But, to keep from damaging the eye sockets,

456
00:38:41.936 --> 00:38:43.395
they've gotta go in through the rectum.

457
00:38:45.106 --> 00:38:46.898
Ain't no man gonna take that route with me.

458
00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:50.735
Is Topper around? I'd like to say goodbye.

459
00:38:51.779 --> 00:38:56.866
He didn't come back last night. He's AWOL.
As soon as Block finds out, he's history.

460
00:38:57.034 --> 00:38:59.661
But flying's his life.
He's the best pilot in the world.

461
00:38:59.745 --> 00:39:01.830
We need him as much as he needs us.

462
00:39:01.914 --> 00:39:05.125
I can't find my lucky gum. Do you have...

463
00:39:05.584 --> 00:39:06.876
Wash Out?

464
00:39:20.725 --> 00:39:23.018
Oh, my God. I missed my flight.

465
00:39:24.061 --> 00:39:25.603
You're amazing.

466
00:39:28.899 --> 00:39:30.191
Dead Meat!

467
00:39:31.444 --> 00:39:35.447
Mary!

468
00:39:37.533 --> 00:39:40.368
- Come to watch me fly?
- No. There was a meltdown at the plant.

469
00:39:40.453 --> 00:39:42.454
- They gave me afternoon off.
- Terrific!

470
00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:48.877
Oh! Good news. We just closed escrow
on our little dream house.

471
00:39:48.961 --> 00:39:51.212
- Wonderful! When do we move in?
- Tuesday.

472
00:39:51.297 --> 00:39:54.049
The kids are stripping
the asbestos off the pipes now.

473
00:39:54.133 --> 00:39:57.385
That's great!
Things couldn't be better for us.

474
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:58.970
I'm so blessed.

475
00:39:59.513 --> 00:40:02.807
Oh! Your life insurance forms
came for you to sign.

476
00:40:04.226 --> 00:40:06.603
Oh, my mirror!

477
00:40:10.399 --> 00:40:11.483
Huh!

478
00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:16.571
- I'll get another pen.
- No need. I'll sign it when I get back.

479
00:40:16.655 --> 00:40:18.281
Well, you know best.

480
00:40:18.365 --> 00:40:22.660
Honey, you know that global-warming
problem? I know how we can reverse it.

481
00:40:22.745 --> 00:40:25.497
- Tell me.
- No, not now, lovey-bumpers.

482
00:40:25.581 --> 00:40:27.749
There'll be plenty of time for that later.

483
00:40:27.833 --> 00:40:30.710
And my investigation into JFK's assassination?

484
00:40:30.961 --> 00:40:32.962
You found the evidence you wanted?

485
00:40:33.089 --> 00:40:37.175
Yes. It's right here in my pocket.
It's big, honey.

486
00:40:37.259 --> 00:40:38.843
It goes all the way to the White House.

487
00:40:39.011 --> 00:40:43.348
- Do you want me to hold it for you?
- Nah. It'll be safe right here.

488
00:40:43.432 --> 00:40:45.600
I'm in a jet. What could go wrong?

489
00:40:45.684 --> 00:40:50.188
Oh, Dead Meat. We just couldn't be
any more perfectly happy.

490
00:40:57.822 --> 00:40:59.823
Where the hell is Topper?

491
00:41:01.492 --> 00:41:02.951
Thanks for joinin' the party!

492
00:41:03.619 --> 00:41:07.330
Hey, Topper!
You seen any of my lucky gum?

493
00:41:07.414 --> 00:41:08.456
No.

494
00:41:10.459 --> 00:41:12.710
Freedom Squadron, start your engines.

495
00:41:14.922 --> 00:41:18.967
God, that's loud. My ear canals
are very sensitive. Stainless steel.

496
00:41:19.051 --> 00:41:22.887
Took a bullet in Corregidor.
Passed straight through. Look at this.

497
00:41:29.228 --> 00:41:30.311
Huh?

498
00:41:32.731 --> 00:41:34.524
We have these to hold down the sound, sir.

499
00:41:35.276 --> 00:41:36.901
Oh, good. Thanks.

500
00:41:40.739 --> 00:41:44.075
Let's hope they do the trick.
Give me the mike, boy.

501
00:41:44.618 --> 00:41:47.078
For the love of God, man, be careful!

502
00:41:47.163 --> 00:41:49.873
Ever since Normandy, this is CorningWare.

503
00:41:49.957 --> 00:41:54.627
Those of you who excel
during these aerial combat exercises

504
00:41:54.712 --> 00:41:59.174
will go on to make up
the greatest fighting unit ever assembled.

505
00:42:01.844 --> 00:42:05.180
- Topper, keep that nose up!
- He's never done that before.

506
00:42:05.264 --> 00:42:08.600
Red team leader, break off.
Prepare to engage.

507
00:42:08.893 --> 00:42:10.268
Roger that.

508
00:42:14.106 --> 00:42:16.524
- Blue leader, prepare for action.
- Roger that.

509
00:42:24.992 --> 00:42:26.784
I'm minus six. Movin' in.

510
00:42:28.913 --> 00:42:31.456
I've got tone! Got him!

511
00:42:31.624 --> 00:42:33.708
Dead Meat, confirm kill.

512
00:42:41.759 --> 00:42:43.426
- Mrs Thompson?
- Yes.

513
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:46.888
- I'm Topper Harley.
- Oh! Dead Meat's talked about you!

514
00:42:46.972 --> 00:42:49.474
Oh, he thinks the world of you!

515
00:42:49.558 --> 00:42:51.976
But... shouldn't you be
up there flying with the squad?

516
00:42:56.148 --> 00:42:58.816
I've got a lock. I'm closing in.

517
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.570
- Uh-oh!
- He's spotted me! He's a slippery devil.

518
00:43:04.823 --> 00:43:07.116
Topper! Watch your right side! Damn!

519
00:43:07.201 --> 00:43:08.993
I'm bailin' out!

520
00:43:13.457 --> 00:43:16.084
Wash Out? What are you doin' here?

521
00:43:16.252 --> 00:43:17.877
There's no time to go into it.

522
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:19.337
Uh-oh!

523
00:43:19.797 --> 00:43:21.839
Do me a favour, don't land.

524
00:43:23.801 --> 00:43:27.011
- Get outta here! We're gonna crash!
- I can't! I'm stuck!

525
00:43:27.221 --> 00:43:29.889
Then I must help you, my friend!
Think well of me!

526
00:43:33.978 --> 00:43:36.020
Thank youuuuu...

527
00:43:36.105 --> 00:43:39.190
- Don't. Don't look.
- Oh, no!

528
00:43:45.906 --> 00:43:47.031
Whoa!

529
00:44:02.131 --> 00:44:03.548
Oh, man!

530
00:44:03.674 --> 00:44:05.300
Wendy, I can fly!

531
00:44:11.765 --> 00:44:14.684
- Hey, Topper.
- Easy, buddy.

532
00:44:17.187 --> 00:44:20.064
- The darnedest thing just happened.
- Hang on, buddy.

533
00:44:20.524 --> 00:44:21.899
Topper?

534
00:44:23.068 --> 00:44:25.194
Swing him around this way.

535
00:44:27.906 --> 00:44:29.782
Let's go. One, two...

536
00:44:31.577 --> 00:44:33.703
Let's move it. Come on!

537
00:44:33.787 --> 00:44:35.413
- Come on!
- Enough!

538
00:44:39.668 --> 00:44:40.835
Hello!

539
00:45:02.816 --> 00:45:05.902
We'll have you in the hospital in no time.

540
00:45:11.283 --> 00:45:13.451
Good morning! Excuse me!

541
00:45:14.495 --> 00:45:16.371
Wait, guys! Wait!

542
00:45:17.664 --> 00:45:19.499
Let's go, let's go.

543
00:45:19.583 --> 00:45:21.626
Easy. Easy, easy, easy.

544
00:45:22.753 --> 00:45:24.879
- Let's move.
- What a ride!

545
00:45:25.839 --> 00:45:28.883
- Wash Out. You made it.
- Why, thank you, André.

546
00:45:28.967 --> 00:45:31.094
I'll have the veal piccata.

547
00:45:33.889 --> 00:45:36.099
- Oh. Get the cardio read-out.
- Where is it?

548
00:45:36.433 --> 00:45:39.894
- Um... It's, uh...
- Hey, fellas...

549
00:45:39.978 --> 00:45:42.397
- Inside there on the left.
- I can't find it!

550
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:46.859
- Doctor!
- What happened?

551
00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:48.319
Plane crash.

552
00:45:50.155 --> 00:45:53.866
- We gotta work fast. I got a lunch.
- You're missing the big picture, Doc.

553
00:45:53.951 --> 00:45:55.993
Nurse, check his penis isn't longer than mine.

554
00:45:56.078 --> 00:45:58.830
- No, Doctor.
- Good. Now this is gonna hurt.

555
00:45:58.914 --> 00:45:59.956
Ow!

556
00:46:00.249 --> 00:46:02.750
Nurse, give me 15cc of morphine, quickly!

557
00:46:02.835 --> 00:46:05.920
- Can you save him?
- Can't be sure. I'm not a good doctor.

558
00:46:06.004 --> 00:46:07.880
Thank you, Nurse. Wait here.

559
00:46:07.965 --> 00:46:11.259
- You gonna be all right, buddy?
- I'm in a hospital! What could go wrong?

560
00:46:21.186 --> 00:46:27.024
Mrs Thompson, I know you must hate me
but... there's something I want you to have.

561
00:46:27.276 --> 00:46:29.318
I've been puttin' a little away
for the past ten years.

562
00:46:29.403 --> 00:46:33.156
It's not much. 2500. I wish I could do more.

563
00:46:34.032 --> 00:46:35.450
Why, Topper.

564
00:46:36.618 --> 00:46:38.202
That's so sweet.

565
00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:44.000
Why, with the three million
I won on this lucky Lotto ticket,

566
00:46:44.084 --> 00:46:48.754
I can take this 2500
and just blow it all on hats.

567
00:46:53.594 --> 00:46:55.428
Right, and halt!

568
00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.942
Pete "Dead Meat" Thompson... is dead.

569
00:47:10.652 --> 00:47:12.195
So is Mo Green,

570
00:47:12.905 --> 00:47:15.531
Tataglia, Barzini,

571
00:47:15.616 --> 00:47:18.117
the heads of all the five families.

572
00:47:19.077 --> 00:47:23.289
It is at moments like these, my dear friends
that we must ask ourselves,

573
00:47:23.373 --> 00:47:26.375
"How can this not be part
of some larger plan?"

574
00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:30.963
Do good men like Dead Meat Thompson
just blink out one day like a bad bulb?

575
00:47:31.256 --> 00:47:34.675
One minute you're in bed
with a knockout gal, or guy,

576
00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:36.636
and the next, you're a compost heap.

577
00:47:37.846 --> 00:47:41.390
Doesn't that bother you?
Because it scares the living piss outta me!

578
00:47:43.143 --> 00:47:45.895
I never thought this could happen.

579
00:47:45.979 --> 00:47:48.231
Don't we have what we need now, Mr Wilson?

580
00:47:48.315 --> 00:47:50.858
This should be enough to prove
that our planes need replacing.

581
00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:56.656
No. They have to fail in combat for the world
to take notice. This is a minor incident.

582
00:47:57.282 --> 00:48:00.201
Minor? I just lost one of my best men!

583
00:48:01.787 --> 00:48:04.205
Are you backing out on us, Block?

584
00:48:04.414 --> 00:48:06.332
I'm doing this for my country,

585
00:48:06.416 --> 00:48:07.917
not for you.

586
00:48:13.048 --> 00:48:15.132
We'll need the backup plan.

587
00:48:15.551 --> 00:48:17.218
Ready... Fire!

588
00:48:18.303 --> 00:48:19.637
Jumpin' Jesus, they're back!

589
00:48:20.472 --> 00:48:23.266
Take cover! Hit the deck!

590
00:48:26.103 --> 00:48:27.562
Cover me!

591
00:48:27.646 --> 00:48:30.690
Battle stations! Battle stations!

592
00:48:33.819 --> 00:48:35.486
Have they no respect for the dead?

593
00:48:43.412 --> 00:48:45.663
God, I love a good funeral.

594
00:49:04.641 --> 00:49:06.809
Topper, where are you going?

595
00:49:07.894 --> 00:49:10.146
I'm handin' in my resignation.

596
00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.481
You were right.
You said I was dangerous, and I am.

597
00:49:12.649 --> 00:49:13.941
Topper, wait.

598
00:49:14.735 --> 00:49:17.695
Please, let's talk. Huh?

599
00:49:20.532 --> 00:49:23.451
They're right. I'm no better than my father.

600
00:49:23.869 --> 00:49:27.913
It seems, no matter what I do,
I end up hurting someone.

601
00:49:29.374 --> 00:49:30.374
Ow!

602
00:49:32.544 --> 00:49:35.338
You've got to stop comparing yourself
with your father.

603
00:49:35.422 --> 00:49:37.381
You're two different people.

604
00:49:37.466 --> 00:49:40.468
- We both killed a man.
- That's just a coincidence.

605
00:49:40.552 --> 00:49:42.637
He loved jets. So do I.

606
00:49:42.721 --> 00:49:44.889
He was a loner, just like me.

607
00:49:44.973 --> 00:49:47.558
For God's sakes, I've even got my father's eyes.

608
00:49:48.393 --> 00:49:52.063
- Topper, please!
- Ah, they're just for luck.

609
00:49:52.522 --> 00:49:54.607
You've got to make your own luck.

610
00:49:54.691 --> 00:49:57.443
Get back in the sky and prove yourself.

611
00:49:57.778 --> 00:49:59.779
Besides, there's something else.

612
00:50:01.406 --> 00:50:06.202
After our first meeting in my office,
I sent my evaluation to Commander Block.

613
00:50:06.787 --> 00:50:10.206
I recommended you be grounded.
I was afraid someone might get hurt.

614
00:50:10.499 --> 00:50:11.916
What are you saying?

615
00:50:13.335 --> 00:50:16.253
I think someone wants Sleepy Weasel to fail.

616
00:50:17.422 --> 00:50:20.257
- That's heavy.
- Totally.

617
00:50:20.342 --> 00:50:22.843
That's the other reason why you need to fly.

618
00:50:22.928 --> 00:50:26.514
This could be your only opportunity
to save the mission

619
00:50:26.598 --> 00:50:30.434
and solve your personal problems,
all in one fell swoop.

620
00:50:43.073 --> 00:50:44.573
Now read it back to me, Francine.

621
00:50:45.992 --> 00:50:49.203
"And if you ever put your goddamn hands
on my wife again..."

622
00:50:52.124 --> 00:50:55.042
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Oh, Blank. Come in.

623
00:50:55.127 --> 00:50:56.794
I've been expecting someone.

624
00:50:56.878 --> 00:50:59.422
- That'll be all, Francine.
- Yes, sir.

625
00:51:03.635 --> 00:51:06.011
- Pudding?
- No, thank you, sir.

626
00:51:06.805 --> 00:51:10.558
I'll put this to you straight.
Thompson's death shocked us all.

627
00:51:10.642 --> 00:51:12.560
And that hot shot Harley is responsible.

628
00:51:12.644 --> 00:51:15.354
I want that smirking little wise-ass
outta here.

629
00:51:17.482 --> 00:51:21.986
Morale on this base is shot to hell.
Just look out there.

630
00:51:23.405 --> 00:51:26.323
Quiet. Now, hardly a man moving.

631
00:51:27.075 --> 00:51:29.201
Roy? Roy!

632
00:51:30.412 --> 00:51:34.331
Huh? I even went to school with that man.
It's just not the same.

633
00:51:34.666 --> 00:51:38.544
Been ignoring me all day.
Remind me to send him a note.

634
00:51:38.628 --> 00:51:40.045
Sir, may I say something?

635
00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:44.300
I know Harley acted irresponsibly.

636
00:51:44.509 --> 00:51:48.012
But his kind lives on the edge.
Always willing to take a chance.

637
00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:51.182
Now, we need Topper for this mission
for just that reason.

638
00:51:55.395 --> 00:51:57.396
I like your thinking, Colonel.

639
00:51:57.481 --> 00:52:00.024
Besides, Thompson wasn't that good a pilot.

640
00:52:00.108 --> 00:52:05.070
He only had a small family. The kids are
a pain in the ass. The wife's on the sauce.

641
00:52:05.155 --> 00:52:07.448
Poor bastard's better off dead.

642
00:52:08.116 --> 00:52:09.408
What size shoes do you wear?

643
00:52:10.535 --> 00:52:12.828
- A nine, sir.
- Good.

644
00:52:13.205 --> 00:52:15.414
It's settled. We'll send Harley to the front.

645
00:52:15.499 --> 00:52:19.460
By the way. Thank you for having us
over to dinner the other night.

646
00:52:19.544 --> 00:52:22.004
Cheryl and I loved the stroganoff.

647
00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:25.508
- Sir, we didn't have dinner the other night.
- Really?

648
00:52:26.384 --> 00:52:29.512
Well, where the hell was I?
And who's this Cheryl?

649
00:52:29.971 --> 00:52:31.680
Ah, doesn't matter.

650
00:52:31.848 --> 00:52:33.390
Run along, Sid.

651
00:52:36.186 --> 00:52:37.394
Cheryl?

652
00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:43.776
Kent?

653
00:52:48.031 --> 00:52:52.618
I came to get my chafing dish. Our orders
just came. We're shipping out in one hour.

654
00:52:52.702 --> 00:52:54.912
Are you comin' along this time?

655
00:52:54.996 --> 00:52:56.997
- The chafing dish is not yours.
- It is.

656
00:52:57.082 --> 00:52:59.208
- It isn't.
- OK, I don't want it.

657
00:52:59.292 --> 00:53:00.709
- I'll take it.
- You stay out of it.

658
00:53:01.461 --> 00:53:03.462
This is not the time or place.

659
00:53:03.547 --> 00:53:06.799
I've got a big score
to settle with you, my friend.

660
00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:08.634
Excuse me.

661
00:53:13.765 --> 00:53:15.266
I've hurt him.

662
00:53:16.101 --> 00:53:17.351
Topper...

663
00:53:18.019 --> 00:53:20.729
Topper, you better go. I have to think.

664
00:53:21.481 --> 00:53:22.982
Well, I don't.

665
00:53:23.608 --> 00:53:27.361
- I've fallen for you like a blind roofer.
- I'm sorry?

666
00:53:28.154 --> 00:53:32.283
My heart is fallin' down around my ankles
like a wet pair of pants.

667
00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:36.912
My whole life, all I've wanted to do is fly.

668
00:53:36.997 --> 00:53:39.123
Bomb stuff. Shoot people down.

669
00:53:39.958 --> 00:53:44.044
But we've been through so much together.
Ramada, I need you.

670
00:53:44.129 --> 00:53:45.129
I want you.

671
00:53:46.548 --> 00:53:51.093
Only you

672
00:53:51.177 --> 00:53:56.807
Can make this world seem bright

673
00:53:56.892 --> 00:54:01.604
Only you

674
00:54:01.688 --> 00:54:05.983
Can make the darkness bright

675
00:54:06.234 --> 00:54:07.318
Wow!

676
00:54:07.611 --> 00:54:12.990
Only you, and you alone

677
00:54:13.533 --> 00:54:18.913
Can thrill me like you do

678
00:54:18.997 --> 00:54:25.920
And fill my heart with love for only you

679
00:54:26.171 --> 00:54:28.422
Wah, wah, wah, wah

680
00:54:28.506 --> 00:54:29.924
Ramada!

681
00:54:30.342 --> 00:54:31.550
Topper!

682
00:54:33.386 --> 00:54:34.929
Ramada!

683
00:54:37.682 --> 00:54:39.058
I love you!

684
00:54:39.809 --> 00:54:41.185
I love you.

685
00:54:43.939 --> 00:54:46.941
You are my destiny

686
00:54:47.025 --> 00:54:49.151
It's not that easy, Ramada.

687
00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:54.198
This is one night you're not turning me out.

688
00:54:55.867 --> 00:54:59.954
The magic that you do

689
00:55:00.038 --> 00:55:03.374
You're my dream come true

690
00:55:03.458 --> 00:55:09.463
My one and only you

691
00:55:09.965 --> 00:55:14.802
Oh-oh, only you

692
00:55:14.886 --> 00:55:19.974
Can make this change in me

693
00:55:20.266 --> 00:55:24.228
For it's true

694
00:55:24.604 --> 00:55:28.816
You are my destiny

695
00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:33.654
When you hold my hand

696
00:55:33.738 --> 00:55:36.198
I understand

697
00:55:36.282 --> 00:55:40.035
The magic that you do

698
00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:43.580
You're my dream come true

699
00:55:43.665 --> 00:55:45.165
My one

700
00:55:47.627 --> 00:55:51.255
And only

701
00:55:51.339 --> 00:55:55.134
You

702
00:55:56.344 --> 00:55:59.263
Topper, I'm so confused. I need time alone.

703
00:56:27.125 --> 00:56:28.625
Admiral Benson!

704
00:56:29.169 --> 00:56:31.628
Really? That's my name, too.

705
00:56:33.131 --> 00:56:38.844
Yankee Doodle Floppy Disk, this is Foxtrot
Zulu Milkshake. Request permission to land.

706
00:56:38.928 --> 00:56:43.182
Roger that. You are cleared to land.
Welcome to the Mediterranean.

707
00:56:43.266 --> 00:56:44.767
Wash Out, is that you?

708
00:56:45.643 --> 00:56:49.772
You bet! They put me in charge of radar.
I'm your eyes on the ground.

709
00:56:51.608 --> 00:56:56.111
All crews report to the flight deck.
All crews report to the flight deck.

710
00:57:36.027 --> 00:57:37.611
Have you no decency?

711
00:57:49.082 --> 00:57:50.707
Ah! The open sea.

712
00:57:52.252 --> 00:57:55.796
Oh, God. I wish I could smell.
I had my nostrils fried in Panmunjom.

713
00:57:56.714 --> 00:57:57.881
Admiral Benson!

714
00:57:59.175 --> 00:58:02.636
Meet Mr Wilson and Mr Rosener
of Rockman Aviation.

715
00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:04.429
They'll be observing the operation.

716
00:58:04.514 --> 00:58:05.597
Yes, of course.

717
00:58:07.142 --> 00:58:09.226
It's OK. I'm all right. No problem.

718
00:58:10.436 --> 00:58:13.856
I slipped on the crab.
Who put that crab there?

719
00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:18.026
- Crab? I didn't see any crab.
- There were two crabs. They work in pairs.

720
00:58:18.361 --> 00:58:20.362
I went to Annapolis, for Christ's sake.

721
00:58:20.446 --> 00:58:25.325
- From the Pentagon, sir. We just decoded it.
- Help me with this. My eyes are ceramic.

722
00:58:25.410 --> 00:58:30.080
A bazooka round at Little Bighorn. Or was it
Okinawa? The one without the Indians.

723
00:58:30.165 --> 00:58:33.000
It's final orders.
We strike tomorrow at 0600.

724
00:58:33.084 --> 00:58:36.086
Excellent. Wake me up at, oh... 5.30.

725
00:59:10.163 --> 00:59:13.832
- Get outta your flight suit. You're not going.
- What do you mean?

726
00:59:13.917 --> 00:59:17.669
This mission is too important
to let you screw it up. You're not flying.

727
00:59:17.962 --> 00:59:19.504
- Am too.
- Are not.

728
00:59:19.631 --> 00:59:23.592
- Am too.
- Oooh!

729
00:59:23.676 --> 00:59:25.886
- All right, mister. Let's go at it.
- Let's do it.

730
00:59:26.846 --> 00:59:28.305
Come on, come on.

731
00:59:41.819 --> 00:59:43.195
Whoa!

732
00:59:43.821 --> 00:59:45.989
- My face!
- My hand!

733
00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:48.867
Attention on deck!

734
00:59:50.536 --> 00:59:51.870
Be seated.

735
00:59:56.292 --> 00:59:58.585
Gentlemen, we've waited
a long time to hear this.

736
00:59:58.670 --> 01:00:02.798
In exactly five hours and 17 minutes,
we hit the enemy toast.

737
01:00:03.299 --> 01:00:07.177
- I think that's the enemy coast, sir.
- Huh? Coast?

738
01:00:09.013 --> 01:00:10.889
That'll take a little more planning.

739
01:00:10.974 --> 01:00:14.685
We have to knock out the nuclear-weapons
plant at Falafel Heights.

740
01:00:14.769 --> 01:00:17.479
The plant goes on line in 12 hours
and is heavily defended.

741
01:00:18.731 --> 01:00:24.278
If you have trouble hitting your objective,
your secondary targets are here and here:

742
01:00:24.362 --> 01:00:27.030
An accordion factory and a mime school.

743
01:00:27.991 --> 01:00:30.701
Good luck, gentlemen. Blink, take over.

744
01:00:33.037 --> 01:00:34.788
Oh, one more thing.

745
01:00:34.872 --> 01:00:37.374
I'll get that. It's probably for me.

746
01:00:42.297 --> 01:00:44.798
Our sortie will proceed as planned.

747
01:00:45.383 --> 01:00:47.884
And I want Topper Harley
leading our squadron into battle.

748
01:00:51.347 --> 01:00:52.764
Lieutenant Commander, sir.

749
01:00:53.433 --> 01:00:56.977
It's nothing personal.
I know I speak for every man here.

750
01:00:57.061 --> 01:00:59.146
We've lost all respect for Harley.

751
01:00:59.230 --> 01:01:01.398
He's poison for the morale of the unit,

752
01:01:01.482 --> 01:01:03.775
and a disaster to the success of this mission.

753
01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:07.529
You're outta line, Gregory.
You'll obey orders and like it.

754
01:01:09.282 --> 01:01:10.741
Now get to your planes.

755
01:01:22.211 --> 01:01:25.088
- Sir?
- What is it, Mr Harley?

756
01:01:26.382 --> 01:01:29.009
- I hope I'm wrong about this.
- What would that be?

757
01:01:29.302 --> 01:01:32.304
Nobody likes playing
for a coach who throws the big game.

758
01:01:33.556 --> 01:01:34.765
What's that supposed to mean?

759
01:01:35.808 --> 01:01:39.311
My uncle told me that not playin' to win
is like sleepin' with your sister.

760
01:01:39.937 --> 01:01:43.815
Sure, she's a great piece of tail
with a blouseful of goodies, but it's illegal.

761
01:01:44.442 --> 01:01:48.320
- Jesus, Topper. Come on.
- Then you get into that whole inbred thing.

762
01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:50.489
Kids with no teeth who play the banjo,

763
01:01:50.573 --> 01:01:53.116
eat apple sauce through a straw,
pork farm animals.

764
01:01:53.701 --> 01:01:54.951
Topper, that's enough.

765
01:01:56.454 --> 01:01:58.663
I think you get my point, sir.

766
01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:00.540
I just hope you're playin' straight with us.

767
01:02:36.953 --> 01:02:40.497
Alpha Velveeta Knuckle Underwear,
you are cleared for takeoff.

768
01:02:41.124 --> 01:02:45.043
When you hit that nuclear-weapons plant,
drop a bomb for me.

769
01:02:45.128 --> 01:02:47.963
Sphincter Mucous Niner Ringworm, roger.

770
01:03:14.699 --> 01:03:15.907
Olé!

771
01:03:33.092 --> 01:03:34.468
Yieeee!

772
01:03:45.396 --> 01:03:49.941
Holy cow! My cap blew off!
Swing her round. We'll pick it up.

773
01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:52.319
But, sir, we're on the mission.

774
01:03:53.446 --> 01:03:56.573
Good thinking.
We'll pick it up on the way back.

775
01:03:57.158 --> 01:04:00.410
We gotta mark the spot, though.
Put Rabinowitz in a life raft.

776
01:04:00.495 --> 01:04:04.164
- Have him row in circles until we return.
- It could be days.

777
01:04:04.916 --> 01:04:09.503
Then put some food in the life raft, man.
Do I have to think of everything?

778
01:04:09.587 --> 01:04:11.963
We'll tape his favourite shows.

779
01:04:12.256 --> 01:04:15.133
- Sir, there's no time.
- OK, OK!

780
01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:17.344
How can I be an admiral without my cap?

781
01:04:17.428 --> 01:04:21.181
It's out there all alone
and I'm powerless to do anything about it.

782
01:04:21.807 --> 01:04:23.975
We're entering enemy airspace.

783
01:04:27.897 --> 01:04:30.857
Sir, it appears we have
unidentified radar contacts.

784
01:04:30.942 --> 01:04:37.614
- Looks like enemy aircraft at 12 o'clock.
- Really? That gives us about... 25 minutes.

785
01:04:37.698 --> 01:04:39.241
Think I'll step out for a burger.

786
01:04:46.165 --> 01:04:51.127
Sir, there are six of them!
Bearing 2-1-5, range 150 mi...

787
01:04:54.131 --> 01:04:56.258
Oh my God, a dozen more of them.

788
01:04:56.342 --> 01:05:01.137
And a blimp! A big, shiny blimp,
and it's slowly moving south!

789
01:05:01.847 --> 01:05:06.059
- Block, have you got a tally on the bandits?
- Roger that. I got 'em.

790
01:05:06.143 --> 01:05:10.313
All right. Resume combat spread.
Attack formation Delta-niner.

791
01:05:10.690 --> 01:05:13.984
Topper in the lead.
Just like your old man, son.

792
01:05:15.111 --> 01:05:18.154
Old Buzz Harley'd be proud of you, Topper.

793
01:05:20.074 --> 01:05:22.284
He's the type that could end up
killing every man in this outfit.

794
01:05:22.368 --> 01:05:24.035
He's poison for morale of the unit.

795
01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.496
Read... my... lips.

796
01:05:26.581 --> 01:05:30.417
No... new... taxes.

797
01:05:31.127 --> 01:05:34.379
- Topper, what are you doing?
- He's frozen! Topper's no good to us!

798
01:05:35.715 --> 01:05:38.633
Abort the mission! Abort the mission!

799
01:05:38.718 --> 01:05:40.510
Return to mother!

800
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:46.975
We can't! They're all over us!

801
01:05:57.987 --> 01:06:01.781
- Damn it! All right, engage!
- I've got a bogie at 12 o'clock!

802
01:06:06.287 --> 01:06:09.581
I got two on my tail!
Kowalski, get 'em off me.

803
01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:14.210
Locked up! Fox two!

804
01:06:18.466 --> 01:06:20.300
My missile didn't track!

805
01:06:20.384 --> 01:06:22.802
My engine's cut out.
I'm losing power.

806
01:06:24.722 --> 01:06:27.390
My cannons won't fire!
What's going on?

807
01:06:29.101 --> 01:06:30.602
I've got two bandits on my six!

808
01:06:36.067 --> 01:06:38.943
This is insane. Wilson and Rosener.

809
01:06:39.779 --> 01:06:43.323
It was them, wasn't it?
They said nobody was gonna get hurt!

810
01:06:43.407 --> 01:06:45.575
Block, call your men back.

811
01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:50.205
Like hell I will! I got
the best pilot in the world up here.

812
01:06:50.373 --> 01:06:52.707
Topper! Topper, do you read me?

813
01:06:52.792 --> 01:06:57.921
I was there 20 years ago. I was there
with your father and Mailman Farnham.

814
01:06:58.130 --> 01:07:01.716
I was an eyewitness.
You gotta listen to me, Topper.

815
01:07:01.801 --> 01:07:03.843
What they said about your dad is wrong.

816
01:07:03.928 --> 01:07:05.804
Eject, Mailman. Eject!

817
01:07:07.431 --> 01:07:09.391
I can't! My seat's jammed!

818
01:07:09.475 --> 01:07:11.559
- Nothing works!
- Stay calm!

819
01:07:11.644 --> 01:07:14.813
- My harness is malfunctioning!
- I'll get it!

820
01:07:16.357 --> 01:07:19.109
Buzz! The nose! The nose!

821
01:07:19.944 --> 01:07:22.696
Whoa! Sit tight!

822
01:07:24.448 --> 01:07:26.783
Whoa... Whoa!

823
01:07:26.867 --> 01:07:29.494
Come on! Hurry!

824
01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:34.916
Get the lead out!

825
01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.961
It's gonna be OK!

826
01:07:40.464 --> 01:07:42.632
Wow! That was sure close!

827
01:07:43.801 --> 01:07:46.428
Buzz! Get back here!

828
01:07:48.681 --> 01:07:50.098
Whoaaa!

829
01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:52.142
Argh!

830
01:07:53.477 --> 01:07:55.145
I'm OK!

831
01:07:56.939 --> 01:07:59.899
Buzz! The wing! The wing!

832
01:07:59.984 --> 01:08:01.234
Hurry!

833
01:08:03.821 --> 01:08:05.864
What, are you on a break?

834
01:08:06.532 --> 01:08:10.326
- Hurry!
- I'm here!

835
01:08:11.746 --> 01:08:13.830
Hey, whose gum is this? Whoa!

836
01:08:13.914 --> 01:08:16.541
Oh, for God's sake! Not now!

837
01:08:21.213 --> 01:08:24.424
Got it! Hold on! We'll bring this baby down!

838
01:08:24.508 --> 01:08:26.050
Stop squirming!

839
01:08:26.677 --> 01:08:27.886
Hang on!

840
01:08:29.013 --> 01:08:31.848
- Whoa!
- Those are my socks!

841
01:08:32.725 --> 01:08:34.768
Buzz! Get back here!

842
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:39.147
Your father did everything
possible to save Mailman's life.

843
01:08:39.231 --> 01:08:43.693
You should be proud, son.
Buzz Harley is a true American hero.

844
01:08:48.032 --> 01:08:50.742
- I'm hit! I'm hit!
- Block, are you all right?

845
01:08:50.826 --> 01:08:52.410
Yes! Yes!

846
01:08:52.953 --> 01:08:54.704
Give 'em hell!

847
01:08:55.039 --> 01:08:57.248
Got it! This is for you, Dad.

848
01:09:01.086 --> 01:09:03.004
- They're on my tail.
- I'm with you, buddy.

849
01:09:05.382 --> 01:09:06.925
Hang in there.

850
01:09:10.513 --> 01:09:12.388
My guns are jammed.

851
01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:14.182
They got tone on me!

852
01:09:15.476 --> 01:09:17.185
I'm gonna have to do it the hard way.

853
01:09:20.064 --> 01:09:21.272
Anybody home?

854
01:09:23.609 --> 01:09:24.984
They fell for that one.

855
01:09:26.111 --> 01:09:29.239
- Topper! Three bandits, 12 o'clock!
- I'm on 'em!

856
01:09:33.452 --> 01:09:35.078
Here we go, loop de loop.

857
01:09:35.246 --> 01:09:37.372
Couscous!

858
01:09:40.292 --> 01:09:42.961
Learned this one from Paula Abdul.

859
01:09:51.136 --> 01:09:52.428
Oldest trick in the book.

860
01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:02.689
Catch me if you can, guys.
Here's an old Buzz Harley move.

861
01:10:06.026 --> 01:10:08.319
- Oh, boys...
- Agh!

862
01:10:10.072 --> 01:10:12.657
I'm on their tails. I've got 'em now.

863
01:10:17.955 --> 01:10:19.372
Hey, buddy.

864
01:10:25.296 --> 01:10:26.546
It looks like they're buggin' out.

865
01:10:29.341 --> 01:10:30.633
Yikes!

866
01:10:38.851 --> 01:10:41.811
Saved by the clouds. Come on in, boys.

867
01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:45.481
A little hide-and-seek.

868
01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:53.698
See ya later, guys.

869
01:10:55.576 --> 01:10:58.661
This could be the end of a beautiful friendship.

870
01:11:02.458 --> 01:11:04.667
Topper, look out!

871
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:07.837
I got two heat-seeking missiles on my tail.

872
01:11:09.465 --> 01:11:12.383
Block, Kent, Kowalski, get the hell outta here.

873
01:11:12.885 --> 01:11:16.846
Get back to the ship!
I got me a nuclear-weapons plant to wax.

874
01:11:17.181 --> 01:11:19.682
- You're committing suicide!
- Do as he says!

875
01:11:23.062 --> 01:11:25.521
We are getting close.

876
01:11:26.273 --> 01:11:28.858
Missiles? Still with me. Come on.

877
01:11:35.407 --> 01:11:37.367
If I can't lose 'em, I'll use 'em.

878
01:11:39.536 --> 01:11:41.079
The mother of all targets.

879
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:46.376
Sayonara, Saddam.

880
01:11:51.882 --> 01:11:55.301
Come in! Are you all right?
Topper, acknowledge!

881
01:11:55.636 --> 01:11:57.887
- Topper, do you read?
- Topper, are you all right?

882
01:12:09.775 --> 01:12:10.900
There they are!

883
01:12:15.447 --> 01:12:17.991
Uh, we're landing. Get out of the way.

884
01:12:20.411 --> 01:12:22.328
Run for your lives!

885
01:12:34.967 --> 01:12:36.801
- Where's Topper?
- Lost contact.

886
01:12:43.934 --> 01:12:46.936
- There he is!
- Pyrex Pickle Blowfish.

887
01:12:47.021 --> 01:12:50.231
Permission to land.

888
01:12:51.275 --> 01:12:53.359
You'll have to talk me down.
I've got damage.

889
01:12:53.444 --> 01:12:55.111
Hold it, hold it!

890
01:12:55.195 --> 01:12:57.321
OK, Topper. Ease her in.

891
01:12:57.406 --> 01:12:59.449
- Landing gear's frozen.
- Lookin' good.

892
01:12:59.533 --> 01:13:02.910
- Lost my radar.
- A little more power now.

893
01:13:02.995 --> 01:13:05.246
- I'm out of fuel.
- Right for lineup.

894
01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:07.790
- Lost a wing.
- Doin' fine.

895
01:13:07.875 --> 01:13:11.377
- There goes the other one.
- OK, Topper. Call the ball.

896
01:13:11.462 --> 01:13:13.212
Touchin' down.

897
01:13:18.927 --> 01:13:20.970
Wha-hoo!

898
01:13:25.142 --> 01:13:26.684
Well done, Jim!

899
01:13:34.568 --> 01:13:37.236
- You're quite a guy!
- So are you!

900
01:13:38.655 --> 01:13:39.989
Hey! Wash Out!

901
01:13:41.325 --> 01:13:42.992
Oh, Topper...

902
01:13:47.247 --> 01:13:50.374
You.

903
01:13:56.048 --> 01:13:58.299
- I got one question for you.
- Shoot.

904
01:13:58.842 --> 01:14:00.635
What is a chafing dish for?

905
01:14:00.719 --> 01:14:05.056
Why, it's a traditional serving piece
used at brunches to keep food warm.

906
01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:08.643
- I thought that was a Crockpot.
- No, no, no.

907
01:14:08.727 --> 01:14:11.604
That's for cooking all day. A chafing dish...

908
01:14:18.112 --> 01:14:22.615
Hey, Topper! Now that you've
made the world safe for democracy,

909
01:14:22.699 --> 01:14:25.326
what will you do
to cash in on your new-found fame?

910
01:14:25.410 --> 01:14:27.411
I'm goin' to Disneyland!

911
01:14:33.710 --> 01:14:37.338
You're very fortunate, Commander Block.
This man has your blood type.

912
01:14:37.965 --> 01:14:41.759
Don't worry, sir. After this transfusion,
you're gonna be just fine.

913
01:14:42.386 --> 01:14:45.805
I've only seen heroism like that one other time.

914
01:14:45.889 --> 01:14:49.308
Maybe you know the pilot:
Leland "Buzz" Harley.

915
01:14:51.186 --> 01:14:54.438
I've been carrying this secret around
for 20 years.

916
01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:56.315
I never spoke up.

917
01:14:57.317 --> 01:14:59.110
I wanted him to fail.

918
01:14:59.528 --> 01:15:01.571
I wanted to be number one.

919
01:15:02.573 --> 01:15:04.073
And I was in love with your mother.

920
01:15:05.409 --> 01:15:09.871
It's not important now, sir. Please,
save your strength for your court martial.

921
01:15:09.997 --> 01:15:12.999
Topper, you had me pegged right.

922
01:15:13.083 --> 01:15:14.834
I was throwin' the big game.

923
01:15:14.918 --> 01:15:15.960
Oh!

924
01:15:18.213 --> 01:15:20.590
I really thought we needed that other airplane.

925
01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:25.970
But now I realise that
American planes'll always be superior

926
01:15:26.054 --> 01:15:29.307
as long as there are
wonderful men like you in the cockpit

927
01:15:29.391 --> 01:15:31.017
and German parts.

928
01:15:31.476 --> 01:15:36.189
I know you think it was me, but it was
Wilson and Rosener who sabotaged the jets.

929
01:15:36.481 --> 01:15:39.192
They played me like a two-bit piccolo.

930
01:15:39.276 --> 01:15:42.737
Oh! Oh...

931
01:15:51.788 --> 01:15:53.164
Whoaaaaa!

932
01:15:53.582 --> 01:15:56.667
I can see my house from here!

933
01:15:59.963 --> 01:16:01.756
Oh no, you don't.

934
01:16:04.092 --> 01:16:06.344
- Admiral!
- You call yourself an American?

935
01:16:06.428 --> 01:16:11.057
That gets my panties in a bunch.
It's scum like you that taint our military.

936
01:16:11.141 --> 01:16:15.978
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- You risked the lives of some fine pilots.

937
01:16:17.814 --> 01:16:19.190
Well, that's my job.

938
01:16:26.073 --> 01:16:27.573
Is it safe?

939
01:16:40.462 --> 01:16:42.713
You look good up there, son.

940
01:17:08.407 --> 01:17:10.700
I think I'm wearing your pants.

941
01:17:27.175 --> 01:17:29.719
- Ramada!
- Kent!

942
01:17:38.395 --> 01:17:40.730
- You're OK.
- Ramada.

943
01:17:41.565 --> 01:17:43.649
You must put me out of your mind.

944
01:17:43.734 --> 01:17:48.237
There's a certain flyboy aboard that ship
that needs you far more than I.

945
01:17:48.655 --> 01:17:51.574
- You must forget me.
- No problem. I will.

946
01:17:51.658 --> 01:17:53.826
Please... Not a tear.

947
01:17:54.995 --> 01:17:58.039
Don't look back. That's my brave girl.

948
01:18:01.251 --> 01:18:05.171
Don't worry, little one!
As long as I have me, I'll survive!

949
01:18:07.132 --> 01:18:08.758
Aarghhh!

950
01:18:28.653 --> 01:18:29.862
Topper!

951
01:18:37.704 --> 01:18:40.456
Go, Bill, go!

952
01:18:40.957 --> 01:18:42.166
Topper!

953
01:18:42.876 --> 01:18:43.959
Wait!

954
01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:47.963
Whoa!

955
01:18:48.924 --> 01:18:50.132
Topper!

956
01:19:41.476 --> 01:19:42.685
Ramada.

957
01:19:43.395 --> 01:19:47.606
Once, perhaps.
Now I'm called Wawatukeena.

958
01:19:48.066 --> 01:19:50.860
- What does it mean?
- Little Sizzling Belly.

959
01:20:11.131 --> 01:20:14.925
Every night I hope and pray

960
01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:18.345
A dream lover will come my way

961
01:20:18.472 --> 01:20:22.099
A girl to hold in my arms

962
01:20:22.184 --> 01:20:24.977
And know the magic of her charms

963
01:20:25.061 --> 01:20:27.062
- Because I want
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

964
01:20:27.147 --> 01:20:28.939
- A girl
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

965
01:20:29.024 --> 01:20:30.733
- To call
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

966
01:20:30.817 --> 01:20:32.109
- My own
- Yeah-yeah

967
01:20:32.194 --> 01:20:34.528
I want a dream lover

968
01:20:34.613 --> 01:20:38.365
I don't have to dream alone

969
01:20:40.452 --> 01:20:43.746
Dream lover, where are you

970
01:20:43.955 --> 01:20:47.500
With a love, oh, so true?

971
01:20:47.584 --> 01:20:51.212
And a hand that I can hold

972
01:20:51.296 --> 01:20:54.006
To feel you near as I grow old?

973
01:20:54.090 --> 01:20:55.841
- Because I want
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

974
01:20:55.926 --> 01:20:57.885
- A girl
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

975
01:20:57.969 --> 01:20:59.720
- To call
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

976
01:20:59.804 --> 01:21:01.013
- My own
- Yeah-yeah

977
01:21:01.097 --> 01:21:03.516
I want a dream lover

978
01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:07.645
I don't have to dream alone

979
01:21:09.523 --> 01:21:13.067
Some day, I don't know how

980
01:21:13.151 --> 01:21:16.445
I know she'll hear my plea

981
01:21:16.530 --> 01:21:20.115
Some way, I don't know how

982
01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:23.744
She'll bring her love to me

983
01:21:23.828 --> 01:21:27.373
Dream lover, until then

984
01:21:27.457 --> 01:21:30.876
I'll go to sleep, I'll dream again

985
01:21:30.961 --> 01:21:34.672
That's the only thing to do

986
01:21:34.756 --> 01:21:37.591
Till all my lover's dreams come true

987
01:21:37.676 --> 01:21:39.802
- Because I want
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

988
01:21:39.886 --> 01:21:41.220
- A girl
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

989
01:21:41.304 --> 01:21:43.264
- To call

01:21:43.348 --> 01:21:44.598
- My own

01:21:44.683 --> 01:21:47.059
I want a dream lover

992
01:21:47.143 --> 01:21:50.521
I don't have to dream alone

993
01:21:53.066 --> 01:21:56.402
Dream lover, until then

994
01:21:56.486 --> 01:21:59.822
I'll go to sleep, I'll dream again

995
01:21:59.906 --> 01:22:03.659
That's the only thing to do

996
01:22:03.743 --> 01:22:06.579
Till all my lover's dreams come true

997
01:22:06.663 --> 01:22:08.664
- Because I want

998
01:22:08.748 --> 01:22:10.499

1001
01:22:13.712 --> 01:22:16.130
I want a dream lover

1002
01:22:16.214 --> 01:22:19.675
I don't have to dream alone

1003
01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:24.263
Please don't make me dream alone

1004
01:22:24.347 --> 01:22:28.017
Don't make me
