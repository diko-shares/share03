1
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.277
Everyone inside now!

2
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:44.493
Lucinda, we're going in.

3
00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:47.747
Lucinda!

4
00:01:49.624 --> 00:01:51.876
Lucinda, we're going in.

5
00:01:53.335 --> 00:01:54.504
Lucinda!

6
00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.679
Now, you remember tomorrow
is our official opening day, don't you?

7
00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:06.015
- Yes, Miss Taylor.
- Yes, Miss Taylor.

8
00:02:06.056 --> 00:02:09.393
And you remember Principal Clark
ran a competition last month

9
00:02:09.476 --> 00:02:14.106
to find the best ideas to celebrate
this very special day.

10
00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.692
- Me! Me! Me!
- Me! Me! Me!

11
00:02:16.776 --> 00:02:20.863
Well, yesterday,
the staff selected the winning idea,

12
00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:24.116
and it came from this class.

13
00:02:25.952 --> 00:02:29.623
The winner is our own

14
00:02:30.624 --> 00:02:32.333
Lucinda Embry.

15
00:02:32.417 --> 00:02:34.252
Lucinda?
Why her?

16
00:02:34.335 --> 00:02:35.796
Lucinda?
Lucinda?

17
00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.589
Come on, everyone.

18
00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:45.806
We'll be closing our dedication ceremony
with the burial of a time capsule.

19
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.975
- Yes?
- What's a time capsule?

20
00:02:57.526 --> 00:03:00.070
This is a time capsule.

21
00:03:00.111 --> 00:03:02.573
Wow.
That's incredible.

22
00:03:02.614 --> 00:03:05.617
Now, I need you
to put your thinking caps on,

23
00:03:05.617 --> 00:03:08.119
because I want each of you to draw

24
00:03:08.161 --> 00:03:11.665
what you think the future
is going to look like.

25
00:03:11.748 --> 00:03:15.544
Then we'll put the pictures in the capsule,
and 50 years from today,

26
00:03:15.627 --> 00:03:21.091
a group of children just like yourselves
will open it up to see what you drew.

27
00:03:22.258 --> 00:03:23.719
Doesn't that sound exciting?

28
00:03:23.844 --> 00:03:26.012
- Yes, Miss Taylor.
- Yes, Miss Taylor.

29
00:03:26.054 --> 00:03:27.598
Let's begin.

30
00:03:31.434 --> 00:03:33.562
That is a lovely spaceship there, Dawn.

31
00:03:33.645 --> 00:03:35.981
Thank you, Miss Taylor.
Well done.

32
00:03:36.064 --> 00:03:39.109
And that is a nice robot, Andrew.
Very good.

33
00:03:40.443 --> 00:03:43.363
Time's up. Everyone hand your work in.

34
00:03:43.446 --> 00:03:46.366
And make sure you write your name
on the envelope.

35
00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:47.450
My name's over here.

36
00:03:47.534 --> 00:03:49.494
Thank you, Harold.
Thank you, Miss Taylor.

37
00:03:49.578 --> 00:03:51.580
Lucinda, you need to finish up now.

38
00:03:51.663 --> 00:03:53.624
- Thank you.
Thank you.

39
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.044
Oh, Lucinda.

40
00:03:59.045 --> 00:04:01.840
The assignment was to draw a picture.

41
00:04:03.885 --> 00:04:05.678
This was your idea.

42
00:04:14.604 --> 00:04:17.899
Okay, I want you all to finish, please.

43
00:04:22.111 --> 00:04:26.198
<i>Welcome to all
our friends and esteemed colleagues.</i>

44
00:04:26.282 --> 00:04:31.453
<i>We, the students and faculty
of William Dawes Elementary,</i>

45
00:04:31.495 --> 00:04:36.333
<i>hereby bury this time capsule
in dedication of our new school,</i>

46
00:04:37.251 --> 00:04:39.211
<i>and we charge our descendents</i>

47
00:04:39.295 --> 00:04:43.925
<i>to open this vault of history
50 years from today.</i>

48
00:04:45.342 --> 00:04:48.971
<i>To the future and the promise that it holds.</i>

49
00:05:34.892 --> 00:05:36.143
Lucinda?

50
00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:38.270
Lucinda?

51
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.565
Lucinda?

52
00:05:40.648 --> 00:05:44.152
I'm certain Lucinda
is simply being over curious.

53
00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:48.115
Can you please help find her?

54
00:05:48.198 --> 00:05:50.534
The cloakroom. Check the cloakroom.

55
00:05:50.618 --> 00:05:52.828
Lucinda. Henry, come on.

56
00:05:53.704 --> 00:05:56.289
- Lucinda?
Come on out now.

57
00:05:56.373 --> 00:05:59.502
Lucinda?

58
00:06:19.062 --> 00:06:20.438
Lucinda.

59
00:06:23.441 --> 00:06:25.152
Oh, my God.

60
00:06:29.072 --> 00:06:33.243
Make them stop.
Please make them stop whispering.

61
00:08:43.374 --> 00:08:45.877
Caleb? Take a look at this.

62
00:08:46.503 --> 00:08:48.004
There you go.

63
00:08:51.508 --> 00:08:52.551
What is it?

64
00:08:52.634 --> 00:08:55.303
Saturn's rings await your approval.

65
00:08:57.388 --> 00:08:59.767
Has anyone found life on other planets?

66
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.187
Not yet. Guess it's just us for now.

67
00:09:05.898 --> 00:09:09.068
Okay.
Then how many that might have life?

68
00:09:09.151 --> 00:09:14.532
Well, if you count the number of stars
similar to our sun in this galaxy,

69
00:09:14.615 --> 00:09:18.619
then you factor in the probability that
they have Earth-like planets orbiting them...

70
00:09:18.703 --> 00:09:20.663
There are 10 million possible worlds

71
00:09:20.705 --> 00:09:24.124
with four million mature enough
for life to evolve.

72
00:09:25.876 --> 00:09:27.503
Why do you even ask?

73
00:09:27.587 --> 00:09:30.339
Just making sure if you're listening.

74
00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.051
- Where you going?
- To watch that Discovery program.

75
00:09:34.093 --> 00:09:37.597
But it's Dad's famous Sunday night
hot dogs on the run...

76
00:09:38.556 --> 00:09:39.557
...time.

77
00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.310
I can't consume that.
I've decided to become a vegetarian.

78
00:09:43.393 --> 00:09:45.104
Well, when were you planning on
telling the guy

79
00:09:45.187 --> 00:09:47.439
who buys the groceries around here?

80
00:09:47.481 --> 00:09:50.610
Are you deaf? I just told you now, Dad.

81
00:09:53.988 --> 00:09:57.825
<i>The cubs are now
six months old and bounding with energy,</i>

82
00:09:57.908 --> 00:10:02.371
<i>but, any parent knows,
this is also a mixed blessing.</i>

83
00:10:03.664 --> 00:10:07.042
- Off.
- No, it's almost over.

84
00:10:07.126 --> 00:10:10.838
You're not gonna be able to concentrate
in class tomorrow.

85
00:10:11.213 --> 00:10:15.384
I don't have class tomorrow.
It's the 50th anniversary, remember?

86
00:10:16.552 --> 00:10:18.012
I remember.

87
00:10:23.225 --> 00:10:24.476
Caleb,

88
00:10:28.105 --> 00:10:31.233
when I said it was just us out there,

89
00:10:31.275 --> 00:10:34.612
you know I was talking about space, right?

90
00:10:34.654 --> 00:10:37.908
I didn't mean heaven, or anything.

91
00:10:37.991 --> 00:10:42.453
- I'm sure wherever Mom is...
- Dad, you don't even believe in heaven.

92
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.751
I never said that, Caleb.

93
00:10:47.834 --> 00:10:51.838
I just said we can't know for sure, that's all.

94
00:10:52.839 --> 00:10:56.843
If you want to believe,
you go ahead and believe, okay?

95
00:10:58.845 --> 00:11:00.388
Okay. Bedtime.

96
00:11:08.939 --> 00:11:12.901
Hey, you and me,

97
00:11:12.984 --> 00:11:15.862
- together forever.
- Forever.

98
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.491
I love you.

99
00:11:20.534 --> 00:11:22.243
I love you, too.

100
00:12:29.521 --> 00:12:30.688
We're going to pose a topic

101
00:12:30.772 --> 00:12:33.733
to get you thinking along the right lines
for your term paper.

102
00:12:33.816 --> 00:12:38.780
It's the subject of randomness
versus determinism in the universe.

103
00:12:38.863 --> 00:12:40.865
Who's jumping in? Jessica?

104
00:12:40.948 --> 00:12:43.826
Determinism says
that occurrences in nature

105
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:47.830
are causally decided by preceding events
or natural laws,

106
00:12:47.914 --> 00:12:51.333
that everything leading up to this point
has happened for a reason.

107
00:12:51.417 --> 00:12:54.420
That's right. That's what determinism says.

108
00:12:58.883 --> 00:13:02.637
Spencer? Tell me something about the sun.

109
00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:03.680
It's hot.

110
00:13:04.806 --> 00:13:06.015
Elaborate.

111
00:13:06.098 --> 00:13:08.851
Temperature's about 10,000 degrees
Fahrenheit on the surface,

112
00:13:08.893 --> 00:13:11.646
- 27 million degrees at the core.
- Good.

113
00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.065
Stacey?

114
00:13:17.109 --> 00:13:19.737
A word or two about the composition.

115
00:13:19.821 --> 00:13:21.238
Mostly hydrogen.

116
00:13:21.363 --> 00:13:24.491
Also helium with some carbon
and nitrogen thrown in there.

117
00:13:24.576 --> 00:13:29.789
Excellent. Now, I want you to think
about the perfect set of circumstances

118
00:13:29.872 --> 00:13:32.917
that put this celestial ball of fire

119
00:13:34.293 --> 00:13:38.673
at just the correct distance

120
00:13:41.593 --> 00:13:45.513
from our little blue planet for life to evolve,

121
00:13:45.555 --> 00:13:48.850
making it possible for you
to be sitting here in this riveting lecture.

122
00:13:50.184 --> 00:13:52.019
But that's a nice thought, right?

123
00:13:52.061 --> 00:13:57.025
Everything has a purpose, an order to it,
is determined.

124
00:13:58.944 --> 00:14:02.114
But then there's the other side
of the argument,

125
00:14:03.991 --> 00:14:09.788
the theory of randomness,
which says it's all simply coincidence.

126
00:14:11.039 --> 00:14:16.086
The very fact we exist is nothing
but the result of a complex

127
00:14:16.128 --> 00:14:19.673
yet inevitable string of chemical accidents

128
00:14:20.966 --> 00:14:23.051
and biological mutations.

129
00:14:24.177 --> 00:14:26.388
There is no grand meaning.

130
00:14:29.517 --> 00:14:31.351
There's no purpose.

131
00:14:45.282 --> 00:14:47.743
What about you,
Professor Koestler?

132
00:14:48.326 --> 00:14:51.288
- What?
- Well, what do you believe?

133
00:14:54.583 --> 00:14:57.335
I think shit just happens.

134
00:14:59.713 --> 00:15:02.758
But that's me. Class dismissed.

135
00:15:06.344 --> 00:15:10.307
Now, that's some very heavy shit
for a Monday morning, by the sounds of it.

136
00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:14.227
Since when does the cosmology
department audit my lectures?

137
00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:18.065
Since my esteemed colleague
in astrophysics owes me a latte.

138
00:15:21.026 --> 00:15:24.196
So what's on
your scientific mind today?

139
00:15:24.237 --> 00:15:28.784
Do you remember Kim's little sister?
Ph-double D's? Remember her?

140
00:15:28.826 --> 00:15:31.494
Is it ethical to say things like that
about your sister-in-law?

141
00:15:31.579 --> 00:15:35.834
What? It's factual. It's peer-reviewed.
I mean, it's like... Anyway, whatever.

142
00:15:35.875 --> 00:15:37.627
- She's in town this Friday.
- Okay.

143
00:15:37.711 --> 00:15:40.714
And she thinks that you're intriguing,
which I thought was code for gay,

144
00:15:40.797 --> 00:15:45.384
but apparently not because she's asked
if you would join us for dinner.

145
00:15:47.428 --> 00:15:50.515
- Yeah, I... I don't know, Phil.
- Come on, John.

146
00:15:50.599 --> 00:15:53.893
Come on, you owe me for last time
you skipped out on me.

147
00:15:53.935 --> 00:15:56.104
- Caleb was panicking.
- Yeah, look, I know.

148
00:15:56.187 --> 00:15:58.272
And the time before that,
he had a sore throat.

149
00:15:58.356 --> 00:16:00.108
- Oh, no.
- What?

150
00:16:00.191 --> 00:16:02.485
- Damn it! Damn it!
- What?

151
00:16:02.569 --> 00:16:05.321
Caleb's ceremony. I'm sorry, Phil.

152
00:16:05.404 --> 00:16:07.448
Hey! Hey! Friday!

153
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.325
I'll think about it!

154
00:16:11.327 --> 00:16:13.580
<i>- This little light of mine
- This little light of mine</i>

155
00:16:13.663 --> 00:16:16.207
<i>- I'm gonna let it shine
- I'm gonna let it shine</i>

156
00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:18.752
<i>- This little light of mine
- This little light of mine</i>

157
00:16:18.835 --> 00:16:21.295
<i>- I'm gonna let it shine
- I'm gonna let it shine</i>

158
00:16:21.379 --> 00:16:23.840
<i>- This little light of mine
- This little light of mine</i>

159
00:16:23.923 --> 00:16:25.675
<i>- I'm gonna let it shine
- I'm gonna let it shine</i>

160
00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:30.847
<i>- Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
- Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine</i>

161
00:16:36.227 --> 00:16:41.482
<i>Fifty years ago, the students and faculty
of William Dawes Elementary</i>

162
00:16:41.608 --> 00:16:44.861
<i>imagined what the future might hold.</i>

163
00:16:44.944 --> 00:16:48.156
<i>Today, we unveil their legacy.</i>

164
00:16:48.239 --> 00:16:51.618
<i>Now, I'd like to introduce you
to someone very special,</i>

165
00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.662
<i>Miss Priscilla Taylor.</i>

166
00:16:56.414 --> 00:16:59.125
<i>Since Miss Taylor was there
for the original dedication,</i>

167
00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:03.004
<i>it's only fitting that we have her
do the honors today.</i>

168
00:17:23.358 --> 00:17:24.777
Wow!

169
00:17:33.994 --> 00:17:36.121
You almost forgot again.

170
00:17:36.205 --> 00:17:40.835
I made it in time to hear you sing.
You were the best one up there.

171
00:17:40.876 --> 00:17:44.797
- You could not hear me.
- I could. I swear.

172
00:17:47.758 --> 00:17:50.135
Gotta go. They're starting!

173
00:17:50.219 --> 00:17:52.096
All right, easy, easy!
No pushing.

174
00:17:52.137 --> 00:17:55.057
Everyone is going to receive an envelope.

175
00:17:58.978 --> 00:18:02.773
Open them gently now. They're very old.

176
00:18:05.442 --> 00:18:07.570
Miss Taylor! Miss Taylor!

177
00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.490
Thank you.

178
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.619
Everyone's gonna get one.

179
00:18:28.966 --> 00:18:31.135
- Hello again, John.
- Hello. How's it going?

180
00:19:01.667 --> 00:19:03.168
Hey, what'd you get?

181
00:19:03.251 --> 00:19:06.547
Boring.
Everyone else got a picture.

182
00:19:25.607 --> 00:19:28.068
Caleb, could you please watch
where you put this?

183
00:19:28.151 --> 00:19:31.362
I don't want you to lose another one.

184
00:19:31.487 --> 00:19:33.699
It's making funny noises.

185
00:19:33.782 --> 00:19:36.076
Try turning the volume down.

186
00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:43.083
Hey, Dad? You know that kid, Jason,
from soccer practice?

187
00:19:43.124 --> 00:19:44.167
Mmm-hmm.

188
00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:48.379
He's having a sleepover this weekend,
and he was wondering if I can come.

189
00:19:48.463 --> 00:19:50.090
Sounds like fun.

190
00:19:50.131 --> 00:19:51.675
They have a boat.

191
00:19:51.717 --> 00:19:55.220
Jason's dad said he might take us out
on the lake.

192
00:19:56.387 --> 00:19:58.014
I'll think about it.

193
00:19:58.098 --> 00:20:01.476
- That means no.
- It means I'll think about it.

194
00:20:07.023 --> 00:20:09.943
What are you doing with this?

195
00:20:09.985 --> 00:20:12.696
You weren't supposed to bring this home.
It belongs to the school.

196
00:20:12.738 --> 00:20:17.576
But maybe it means something,
like a math puzzle or something like that.

197
00:20:17.618 --> 00:20:21.204
Yeah, that's good, I don't know,
but it's not ours to keep.

198
00:20:21.246 --> 00:20:25.000
Now, you return this as soon
as you get to school tomorrow. Got it?

199
00:20:25.083 --> 00:20:27.252
Okay, let's go. Bedtime.

200
00:20:41.851 --> 00:20:47.356
<i>O'er thy spirit gently stealing</i>

201
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:56.991
<i>I my loving vigil keeping</i>

202
00:20:57.074 --> 00:21:01.871
<i>All through the night</i>

203
00:21:05.833 --> 00:21:07.669
<i>Goodnight, baby.</i>

204
00:21:08.628 --> 00:21:10.212
Goodnight, Mom.

205
00:21:33.319 --> 00:21:37.239
<i>Our tigress lives

206
00:21:37.281 --> 00:21:39.534
<i>in the forests of Kipling's Jungle Book,</i>

207
00:21:40.492 --> 00:21:42.620

208
00:21:42.704 --> 00:21:45.582

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.253
<i>Year after year...</i>

210
00:22:03.766 --> 00:22:05.059
Damn it.

211
00:23:09.667 --> 00:23:11.209
9l11l01.

212
00:23:38.571 --> 00:23:42.032
Two thousand, nine hundred
and ninety-six.

213
00:23:45.828 --> 00:23:47.246
Come on.

214
00:23:49.624 --> 00:23:51.543
What the hell is this?

215
00:25:20.006 --> 00:25:22.592
<i>In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina...</i>

216
00:25:22.676 --> 00:25:25.512
<i>There could be
thousands of bodies here...</i>

217
00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.484
Oh, my God.

218
00:25:44.907 --> 00:25:45.991
Dad?

219
00:25:48.786 --> 00:25:50.913
Dad, we're gonna be late!

220
00:25:57.795 --> 00:26:00.172
Do you have your knapsack all set?

221
00:26:02.925 --> 00:26:05.427
Thanks for the ride, Mr. Koestler.

222
00:26:06.095 --> 00:26:08.806
Dad, are you sick?

223
00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.016
I'm fine.

224
00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:14.144
Don't you think you're acting
kind of awkward today?

225
00:26:14.186 --> 00:26:18.440
Am I awkward?
I just had a lot of work to do last night.

226
00:26:19.734 --> 00:26:20.943
Okay.

227
00:26:21.861 --> 00:26:23.988
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

228
00:26:31.453 --> 00:26:32.454
Look at this.

229
00:26:32.496 --> 00:26:34.456
- Look at the numbers beside the date.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

230
00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:35.958
Two thousand, nine hundred
and ninety-six.

231
00:26:36.041 --> 00:26:37.084
Right.

232
00:26:37.167 --> 00:26:38.669
That's how many people died
in the attacks that day.

233
00:26:38.753 --> 00:26:39.837
- Yeah.
- All right, stay with me.

234
00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:43.090
I know how this sounds, but I've matched
these numbers to the dates

235
00:26:43.173 --> 00:26:47.970
of every major global disaster
for the last 50 years in perfect sequence,

236
00:26:48.012 --> 00:26:49.304
except for three.

237
00:26:49.346 --> 00:26:52.600
And these events haven't occurred yet,
starting with this one.

238
00:26:52.683 --> 00:26:55.853
So tomorrow, somewhere on the planet,
this number string predicts

239
00:26:55.895 --> 00:27:00.816
that 81 people are gonna die
in some kind of tragedy.

240
00:27:00.941 --> 00:27:04.821
- Whoa. I mean, have a listen to yourself.
- I know.

241
00:27:04.905 --> 00:27:06.364
- It sounds pretty crazy.
- I know.

242
00:27:06.447 --> 00:27:08.491
I mean, even for you.

243
00:27:15.874 --> 00:27:18.001
- What's this?
- Open it.

244
00:27:20.461 --> 00:27:21.630
Oh!

245
00:27:22.881 --> 00:27:24.633
Why are you showing me this?

246
00:27:24.716 --> 00:27:29.095
The day Allison died in the fire,
it's on the list, too,

247
00:27:29.805 --> 00:27:34.350
from a piece of paper that's been
buried in the ground for five decades.

248
00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.604
- Yeah.
- Can you explain that, Phil?

249
00:27:38.605 --> 00:27:41.692
I was up all night going over this.
I went through that list again and again,

250
00:27:41.775 --> 00:27:44.653
and I tried to fault it and I couldn't.

251
00:27:44.736 --> 00:27:47.030
Maybe someone's playing
a really shitty joke...

252
00:27:47.113 --> 00:27:51.076
Right! Right! Except I saw them dig it up!

253
00:27:53.119 --> 00:27:55.163
I watched them pull the capsule
out of the ground

254
00:27:55.246 --> 00:27:57.290
and hand that sealed envelope to my kid.

255
00:27:57.332 --> 00:27:59.668
Okay, let me ask you this, then.

256
00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:02.003
All these uncircled numbers,
what do they mean?

257
00:28:02.087 --> 00:28:04.214
I don't know yet. Maybe nothing.
But the circled...

258
00:28:04.297 --> 00:28:06.717
Maybe they all mean nothing.

259
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.595
Okay, Phil, hey,
can we just start over here?

260
00:28:09.678 --> 00:28:13.515
I'm not saying that 81 people
are going to die tomorrow, okay?

261
00:28:13.557 --> 00:28:16.184
I'm just trying to understand
why this is saying they will.

262
00:28:16.267 --> 00:28:18.895
Okay, it's spooky, all right? I'll grant you.
It's more than spooky.

263
00:28:18.937 --> 00:28:20.480
But just step back, all right?

264
00:28:20.564 --> 00:28:23.692
You have all these uncircled numbers
with no sequence to them.

265
00:28:23.775 --> 00:28:26.903
I mean, numerology,
kabala, Pythagorean cults,

266
00:28:26.945 --> 00:28:29.656
there are systems
that find meaning in numbers,

267
00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:32.158
and they are a dime a dozen. Why?

268
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.579
Because people see
what they want to see in them.

269
00:28:38.123 --> 00:28:40.250
I mean,
that's really what you think I'm doing?

270
00:28:40.333 --> 00:28:43.546
Yeah, I think that losing Allison
has spun you off your axis a little,

271
00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:46.423
and I think it's clouded your judgment.

272
00:28:50.803 --> 00:28:53.556
I'm just saying it's clouded your judgment.

273
00:28:53.598 --> 00:28:55.349
Don't you think?

274
00:28:57.226 --> 00:28:59.854
- Where are you going?
- Off campus.

275
00:29:22.251 --> 00:29:23.545
Yes?

276
00:29:25.505 --> 00:29:27.464
But you do remember her?

277
00:29:27.507 --> 00:29:31.468
Oh, yes. I remember Lucinda.

278
00:29:33.304 --> 00:29:36.683
She was such a sad little girl.

279
00:29:43.981 --> 00:29:46.483
Would you like some iced tea?

280
00:29:46.526 --> 00:29:49.445
Oh, no. Thank you. Thank you.

281
00:29:50.613 --> 00:29:55.326
Do you remember the day your students
buried the time capsule?

282
00:29:55.409 --> 00:29:58.705
Oh, yes.
The children were so excited.

283
00:29:58.746 --> 00:30:00.707
And what about Lucinda?

284
00:30:01.999 --> 00:30:05.086
That was the day we couldn't find her.

285
00:30:05.127 --> 00:30:08.380
She was hiding in a closet, under the gym,

286
00:30:08.464 --> 00:30:13.260
scratching at the door with her fingernails
like some kind of animal.

287
00:30:13.803 --> 00:30:15.722
Scratching at the door?

288
00:30:16.973 --> 00:30:20.602
- Why was she hiding?
- I'm not sure.

289
00:30:20.643 --> 00:30:23.939
She was holding up the class
writing all those silly numbers.

290
00:30:23.981 --> 00:30:26.358
I had to hurry her along.

291
00:30:27.484 --> 00:30:29.528
Then we found her,

292
00:30:29.528 --> 00:30:33.115
and I knew something had frightened
the poor dear,

293
00:30:33.198 --> 00:30:36.827
but we never could get her
to tell us what it was.

294
00:30:36.869 --> 00:30:42.207
Miss Taylor, my son got
Lucinda's time capsule message.

295
00:30:44.793 --> 00:30:48.296
Do you remember this?
Is this what she wrote?

296
00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:53.093
Oh, Professor, you are testing
an old woman's memory.

297
00:30:53.176 --> 00:30:56.764
- Can you believe it's been 50 years?
- It's a long time.

298
00:31:04.187 --> 00:31:06.189
I believe that's it.

299
00:31:07.608 --> 00:31:09.192
How rude of me.

300
00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:15.448
I never offered you a drink.
Would you like some iced tea?

301
00:31:15.533 --> 00:31:17.785
No, thank you. I'm fine.

302
00:31:17.868 --> 00:31:20.037
I thought maybe I could meet her.

303
00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:25.167
Oh! I'm sorry.
Lucinda passed away several years ago.

304
00:31:29.004 --> 00:31:31.674
I said I'm Caleb Koestler's father.

305
00:31:31.757 --> 00:31:34.677
I'm calling to find out
the names of the two janitors

306
00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:39.181
that pulled the time capsule out
of the ground yesterday at the ceremony.

307
00:32:01.287 --> 00:32:04.123
I'm not sure I understand
why that would be a problem for you.

308
00:32:06.417 --> 00:32:10.088
<i>Yes, sir, we're afraid that
that's privileged information.</i>

309
00:32:22.684 --> 00:32:23.977
Caleb!

310
00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.692
- Who was that?
- I don't know. Just some guys.

311
00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:32.902
What did he give you?

312
00:32:32.986 --> 00:32:35.488
Just this. Kind of cool, isn't it?

313
00:32:40.744 --> 00:32:43.622
What did I say about talking to strangers?

314
00:32:44.372 --> 00:32:45.582
Have you done your homework?

315
00:32:45.665 --> 00:32:47.041
Give me 10 more minutes of practice.

316
00:32:47.125 --> 00:32:50.670
I don't want to have to ask you twice,
Caleb. Come on.

317
00:33:08.522 --> 00:33:09.480
Hey!

318
00:33:12.358 --> 00:33:13.527
Hey, stranger.

319
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:16.362
At what age do we learn to knock?

320
00:33:16.404 --> 00:33:19.866
I said I was going to drop by on my way
to the graveyard shift, remember?

321
00:33:19.949 --> 00:33:22.201
- Didn't you get my message?
- I've been busy.

322
00:33:22.285 --> 00:33:24.996
Can you not play with my things?

323
00:33:25.079 --> 00:33:28.416
- You're always busy.
- Yes! Yes.

324
00:33:31.753 --> 00:33:34.756
How's my nephew?
Decided to become a vegetarian.

325
00:33:34.798 --> 00:33:37.509
A what?
- Why, you got a problem with that?

326
00:33:37.592 --> 00:33:42.097
You're not feeding him Dad's famous
Sunday night hot dogs again, are you?

327
00:33:43.015 --> 00:33:45.851
You know, if you want someone to take him
off your hands for the evening

328
00:33:45.893 --> 00:33:48.353
so you can go out, you know,
like normal people do...

329
00:33:48.395 --> 00:33:50.606
I appreciate the offer, but we're fine.

330
00:33:50.731 --> 00:33:53.609
And, believe it or not, Caleb and I have got
a good thing going here.

331
00:33:53.693 --> 00:33:54.694
Uh-huh?

332
00:33:54.777 --> 00:33:58.280
Yeah. So you can report
that back to headquarters.

333
00:33:58.531 --> 00:34:01.033
Mom says hi. So does Dad.

334
00:34:01.826 --> 00:34:04.954
Grace, don't.

335
00:34:07.289 --> 00:34:09.499
I get that you don't like
being the son of a pastor.

336
00:34:09.584 --> 00:34:11.669
I am the son of a pastor.

337
00:34:11.752 --> 00:34:13.295
That's fine.

338
00:34:13.378 --> 00:34:17.633
- You're still his son. Can't you let it go?
- Can't he?

339
00:34:17.717 --> 00:34:20.385
You know he asks after you
every time I see him.

340
00:34:20.427 --> 00:34:22.847
- He worries about you.
- He said that?

341
00:34:22.888 --> 00:34:25.140
- He doesn't have to.
- Right.

342
00:34:27.059 --> 00:34:29.979
You're going to have to speak to him
one day, you know.

343
00:34:30.062 --> 00:34:31.897
This can't go on forever.

344
00:34:31.981 --> 00:34:34.191
You know it's what Allison wanted,

345
00:34:34.274 --> 00:34:37.653
for Caleb to have a grandfather,
and vice versa.

346
00:34:40.823 --> 00:34:43.283
Okay, I'm going. I'm going.

347
00:34:44.326 --> 00:34:47.412
By the way, Grace, how are you?
How's your life? What's going on for you?

348
00:34:47.496 --> 00:34:50.666
- Thank you, John, for asking.
- I have to get up early in the morning.

349
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:52.710
What have you got going on?
I'll say a prayer.

350
00:34:52.793 --> 00:34:54.128
Please...

351
00:34:55.588 --> 00:34:57.131
Don't.

352
00:34:57.172 --> 00:34:58.508
Okay.

353
00:35:01.969 --> 00:35:04.054
<i>And at the ASX 200 index in Australia,</i>

<i>Tonight, in the Gulf of Mexico,</i>

<i>an explosion on a soon-to-be
decommissioned oilrig</i>

370

<i>Officials don't yet know
the exact cause of the explosion,</i>

372
00:35:53.104 --> 00:35:56.942
<i>but believe a malfunction in
the cooling system may have been at fault.</i>

373
00:35:57.025 --> 00:35:58.860
<i>Our last run into the rig...</i>

374
00:35:58.985 --> 00:36:01.154
<i>Due to the prompt response

<i>Thunderstorms are blowing across...</i>

385
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:41.361
- Hello?
- Dad, where are you?

386
00:36:41.444 --> 00:36:44.280
You're on carpool this afternoon.

387
00:36:44.364 --> 00:36:46.032
Caleb, I am so sorry.

388
00:36:47.242 --> 00:36:49.828
I'll pick you up in 10 minutes. Okay?

389
00:36:49.911 --> 00:36:51.580
Okay. Bye.

390
00:37:05.052 --> 00:37:09.015
<i>William Dawes

<i>We can't get to the phone right now,

394
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:20.735
Hey, Phil, it's John.

395
00:37:23.195 --> 00:37:25.322
I'm sorry about yesterday.

396
00:37:25.364 --> 00:37:28.492
I kind of freaked out on you, didn't I?

397
00:37:29.744 --> 00:37:34.541
Well, look, I'm not ready to meet anyone
in any kind of special way, you know,

398
00:37:34.582 --> 00:37:38.878
but I would like to take you up
on your offer for dinner.

399
00:37:40.212 --> 00:37:45.885
I think it would be good for me to just,
you know, get out of the house and...

400
00:38:06.573 --> 00:38:09.283
The uncircled numbers are locations.

401
00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.747
This location.

402
00:38:30.805 --> 00:38:34.433
Get back in your vehicles.
We'll clear this up in a minute.

403
00:38:34.517 --> 00:38:37.104
Get these people back in their cars!

404
00:38:38.772 --> 00:38:41.066
We can open up the far lane.

405
00:38:42.067 --> 00:38:44.987
What's going on?
Can we get through or what?

406
00:38:47.239 --> 00:38:49.617
Hi. Is everything okay?

407
00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:51.910
I'm sorry, sir,
but you need to get back to your car.

408
00:38:51.952 --> 00:38:55.748
- Anybody hurt?
- A couple of injuries, but nothing serious.

409
00:38:58.208 --> 00:39:01.086
Get down! Get away!

410
00:39:41.209 --> 00:39:43.170
Hey! Hey!

411
00:40:12.032 --> 00:40:15.369
Help me! Please!

412
00:40:15.494 --> 00:40:17.831
Help me!

413
00:40:17.914 --> 00:40:21.501
Help me, please! Help me!

414
00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.245
Are you okay, sir?

415
00:40:57.328 --> 00:40:59.413
Step back, sir. Step away.

416
00:41:16.305 --> 00:41:21.060
<i>Today we witnessed one of
the worst days in recent US aviation history</i>

417
00:41:21.185 --> 00:41:26.482
<i>when four planes crash-landed
across as many states from Maine to Miami.</i>

<i>One tragically ended in disaster

419

<i>2 miles from the runway near

421
00:41:38.912 --> 00:41:41.748
<i>No act of terrorism
is expected to be involved.</i>

422
00:41:41.831 --> 00:41:44.876
<i>The National Transportation Safety Board
is looking into possibilities</i>

423
00:41:44.959 --> 00:41:49.088
<i>that a malfunction in the navigational
systems of the planes caused the crashes...</i>

424
00:41:49.172 --> 00:41:52.133
- You didn't tell him anything?
- Of course not.

425
00:41:52.216 --> 00:41:56.221
<i>First estimates put
the presumed dead at 81.</i>

426
00:41:56.305 --> 00:41:57.848
<i>Do you need to talk?
- NTS is linking</i>

427
00:41:57.932 --> 00:41:59.809
<i>possible navigational malfunctions</i>

<i>... of electromagnetic radiation

430
00:42:03.729 --> 00:42:05.565
I just want to sleep.

431

<i>Government officials are quick to reiterate
that at this time</i>

432
00:42:09.193 --> 00:42:12.321
<i>no act of terrorism is suspected

433
00:42:19.328 --> 00:42:22.497
What happened, Dad? What's going on?

434
00:42:22.582 --> 00:42:25.042
Truck broke down on the highway.

435
00:42:33.801 --> 00:42:36.136
It's more than that, isn't it?

436
00:42:38.639 --> 00:42:40.307
I'm going to bed.

437
00:42:43.102 --> 00:42:45.104
Get your homework done.

438
00:42:46.355 --> 00:42:50.484
And you should go to bed, too.
No TV tonight.

439
00:42:50.568 --> 00:42:54.822
- Why? I always watch an hour of TV.
- No more questions, Caleb.

440
00:42:54.905 --> 00:42:58.868
I can ask questions when you tell me
things to do that don't make sense.

441
00:42:58.951 --> 00:43:02.496
You won't let me play soccer,
you won't let me stay over at Jason's,

442
00:43:02.538 --> 00:43:04.498
and now you won't tell me what's going on

443
00:43:04.582 --> 00:43:08.210
and why you're acting so weird all the time.

444
00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:10.212
I'm not a kid anymore.

445
00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:56.176
Oh, my God. John, you... You were there?

446
00:43:58.344 --> 00:44:04.475
The date, the number of dead,
the GPS coordinates, lat and long.

447
00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:08.188
- Why didn't I see that?
- It wasn't coincidence.

448
00:44:08.271 --> 00:44:11.733
I drove past at the exact moment
the prediction came true.

449
00:44:11.817 --> 00:44:12.943
It's not coincidence.

450
00:44:13.026 --> 00:44:15.529
Okay, John, I didn't say it was.

451
00:44:18.073 --> 00:44:20.951
So what are we calling this?
Synchronicity?

452
00:44:21.034 --> 00:44:25.747
Two unrelated events,
digging up a time capsule, plane crash,

453
00:44:25.831 --> 00:44:29.626
combined to create a significance
for the subject, you?

454
00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:32.128
I keep seeing their faces,

455
00:44:33.964 --> 00:44:35.340
burning.

456
00:44:38.093 --> 00:44:39.469
Oh, man.

457
00:44:41.888 --> 00:44:45.809
Okay, look.
We're way beyond the bounds here, John.

458
00:44:45.892 --> 00:44:47.310
We don't have a frame of reference.

459
00:44:47.393 --> 00:44:50.897
There could be multiple meanings
to consider.

460
00:44:50.981 --> 00:44:53.191
There are two disasters left.

461
00:44:54.067 --> 00:44:55.527
What are you saying?

462
00:44:55.611 --> 00:45:01.783
The numbers are warnings meant for me.

463
00:45:02.325 --> 00:45:05.537
They might just as easily
be a warning to stay away.

464
00:45:05.621 --> 00:45:08.248
You could have been killed today, John.
Caleb would have been orphaned,

465
00:45:08.331 --> 00:45:10.918
and you want to go put yourself
back in harm's way?

466
00:45:11.002 --> 00:45:12.837
Two disasters left.

467
00:45:21.012 --> 00:45:25.892
Right now my scientific mind is telling me
to have nothing more to do with this,

468
00:45:26.726 --> 00:45:28.728
and yours should, too.

469
00:48:01.423 --> 00:48:03.842
Dad!

470
00:48:14.144 --> 00:48:16.479
Caleb, what's wrong? What's wrong?

471
00:48:16.522 --> 00:48:17.940
Dad!

472
00:48:18.023 --> 00:48:20.609
It's okay. It's okay.

473
00:48:22.778 --> 00:48:24.780
It's just a bad dream.

474
00:48:27.325 --> 00:48:29.243
It's just a bad dream.

475
00:48:42.799 --> 00:48:44.008
Hey!

476
00:48:51.641 --> 00:48:52.767
Hey!

477
00:48:54.143 --> 00:48:56.521
You stay away from us, you hear?

478
00:48:57.355 --> 00:48:59.148
Want some of this?

479
00:49:17.041 --> 00:49:19.669
One, two, three...

480
00:49:35.226 --> 00:49:37.979
- Got your hat, honey?
- Yeah.

481
00:50:14.517 --> 00:50:17.520
Caleb, why don't you check out
the dire wolf?

482
00:50:17.562 --> 00:50:20.147
- I'll catch up with you, okay?
- Okay.

483
00:50:34.161 --> 00:50:36.664
Do you know that all wolves are born deaf?

484
00:50:36.747 --> 00:50:38.373
Really?

485
00:50:38.415 --> 00:50:39.875
But, you know, when they get older,

486
00:50:39.959 --> 00:50:42.503
they can hear another wolf's howl
from 10 miles away.

487
00:50:42.587 --> 00:50:44.755
Wow. How did you know that?

488
00:50:44.839 --> 00:50:47.466
<i>I read it in a National Geographic.</i>

489
00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:50.553
<i>Mammal responses to rising
temperatures and other climate changes...</i>

490
00:50:50.636 --> 00:50:51.721
Hi.

491
00:50:52.555 --> 00:50:53.639
Hi.

492
00:50:53.723 --> 00:50:55.725
Is that your daughter?

493
00:50:57.142 --> 00:51:01.063
- Yeah, why?
- Why? That's my son,

494
00:51:01.105 --> 00:51:04.609
and they look like
they're already best friends.

495
00:51:04.692 --> 00:51:07.653
Yeah, Abby's probably telling him
about the animals.

496
00:51:07.695 --> 00:51:11.907
Even as a baby,
she was completely fascinated with them.

497
00:51:11.991 --> 00:51:16.579
Yeah, he's the same.
He likes extinct animals.

498
00:51:18.748 --> 00:51:20.040
I'm John.

499
00:51:21.333 --> 00:51:22.877
Hi. Diana.

500
00:51:23.961 --> 00:51:25.295
What are they doing now?

501
00:51:25.379 --> 00:51:27.840
Caleb's showing her something
in sign language.

502
00:51:27.923 --> 00:51:30.801
- I'm sorry. I didn't realize...
- He's not.

503
00:51:32.261 --> 00:51:35.347
Sounds just get jumbled up sometimes.

504
00:51:36.557 --> 00:51:40.520
He has a hearing aid, which helps,
but he's not deaf.

505
00:51:40.561 --> 00:51:43.147
He is an expert in sign language.

506
00:51:44.608 --> 00:51:47.402
I don't think it's ever been this hot
in October.

507
00:51:47.485 --> 00:51:49.154
Air conditioner must be out.

508
00:51:49.237 --> 00:51:51.197
Dad, can we get a drink?

509
00:51:51.281 --> 00:51:52.741
Can we get one, too?

510
00:51:52.824 --> 00:51:55.577
Hey, would you and Abby like to join us?

511
00:51:56.912 --> 00:51:58.789
Sure, that'd be nice.

512
00:51:59.623 --> 00:52:00.999
Abby, this is John.

513
00:52:01.082 --> 00:52:02.458
Hi.
Hey, Abby.

514
00:52:02.918 --> 00:52:03.919
What's that over there?

515
00:52:04.002 --> 00:52:06.963
It can be tough sometimes,
because, you know, I'm by myself.

516
00:52:07.047 --> 00:52:08.840
I know how you feel.

517
00:52:08.924 --> 00:52:11.927
- You're a single parent, too?
- Yeah.

518
00:52:12.928 --> 00:52:13.970
I kicked him out years ago.

519
00:52:14.054 --> 00:52:16.097
He couldn't keep his hands to himself,

520
00:52:16.181 --> 00:52:19.518
so I decided he couldn't keep me
to himself either.

521
00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:23.605
Well, it's... It's his loss.

522
00:52:25.774 --> 00:52:28.234
And you? You're separated, or...

523
00:52:29.402 --> 00:52:30.946
Diana,

524
00:52:32.989 --> 00:52:35.450
we didn't meet here by accident.

525
00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:40.622
I need to talk to you about something,

526
00:52:40.706 --> 00:52:44.292
ask you something about your mother.

527
00:52:46.837 --> 00:52:49.965
My mother? What about my mother?

528
00:52:50.048 --> 00:52:55.178
Did she have some kind of ability?

529
00:52:56.597 --> 00:52:58.515
Ability?

530
00:52:58.599 --> 00:53:01.059
A gift of some kind?

531
00:53:03.436 --> 00:53:06.147
- Who are you?
- Yeah, it's awkward. You don't know me.

532
00:53:06.231 --> 00:53:09.651
I'm John Koestler.
I teach astrophysics at MIT.

533
00:53:09.735 --> 00:53:11.778
My son goes to William Dawes Elementary,

534
00:53:11.862 --> 00:53:14.781
which is the same school
your mother went to.

535
00:53:14.823 --> 00:53:20.495
Fifty years ago, she put this
in a time capsule. It's a list of dates,

536
00:53:20.621 --> 00:53:25.668
events that I think
she believed would happen.

537
00:53:25.752 --> 00:53:27.044
Look, I don't know
what any of this is about...

538
00:53:27.128 --> 00:53:29.421
And I thought if I could talk to you
or your father...

539
00:53:29.506 --> 00:53:31.173
My father's dead.

540
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:37.889
I think it's possible that there are people,
like your mother, Lucinda,

541
00:53:37.930 --> 00:53:40.099
who can see things before they occur.

542
00:53:40.182 --> 00:53:42.602
Abby, we're leaving!

543
00:53:42.644 --> 00:53:43.936
Honey?

544
00:53:45.229 --> 00:53:46.981
I followed one of your mother's predictions

545
00:53:47.064 --> 00:53:50.234
and I watched 81 people burn to death
in that plane crash yesterday,

546
00:53:50.276 --> 00:53:53.154
when she said it would happen,
where she said it would happen,

547
00:53:53.195 --> 00:53:55.072
and there was nothing I could do about it.

548
00:53:55.156 --> 00:53:57.992
She says 170 people will die tomorrow
in New York City,

549
00:53:58.075 --> 00:54:00.870
and in three days' time,
October 19th, 33 more.

550
00:54:00.953 --> 00:54:03.497
Stay away from me and my daughter.

551
00:54:04.707 --> 00:54:08.210
Abby? Let's go, honey. Come on.

552
00:54:14.926 --> 00:54:17.053
Stay right there. Diana?

553
00:54:17.637 --> 00:54:19.346
Diana, I think this has something
to do with my son.

554
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:20.557
Get in there, honey.

555
00:54:20.598 --> 00:54:23.100
I don't know how, or why,
but I think he's in danger.

556
00:54:23.225 --> 00:54:26.270
So I'm asking you please, please help us.

557
00:54:28.147 --> 00:54:29.607
I can't.

558
00:54:47.249 --> 00:54:50.044
<i>A class-action suit
brought by the families of the victims</i>

559
00:54:50.127 --> 00:54:53.005
<i>is meant to be heard beginning next month.</i>

560
00:54:53.089 --> 00:54:57.134
<i>Commuters along the Eastern Seaboard
are reassessing their travel plans</i>

561
00:54:57.218 --> 00:55:01.388
<i>in response to an FBI warning
of a possible terrorist plot.</i>

562
00:55:01.472 --> 00:55:04.560
<i>The Department of Homeland Security
raised the national threat level</i>

563
00:55:04.643 --> 00:55:08.271
<i>from elevated to high
after intelligence reports suggested</i>

564
00:55:08.355 --> 00:55:12.234
<i>an attack on a major East Coast city
may be imminent.</i>

565
00:55:12.317 --> 00:55:14.737
<i>Police have urged citizens to stay vigilant.</i>

566
00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:54.234
<i>FBI New York,
how may I direct your call?</i>

567
00:55:54.317 --> 00:55:57.946
The attack will take place tomorrow at
the corner of Lafayette and Worth Streets.

568
00:55:58.030 --> 00:56:00.783
Cordon off the area from midnight.
Are you clear on that?

569
00:56:00.866 --> 00:56:02.325
<i>Sir, let me patch you through
to our agents...</i>

570
00:56:02.409 --> 00:56:06.163
Please! Do exactly as I say
or many people will die.

571
00:56:06.246 --> 00:56:08.373
This is not a crank call.

572
00:56:12.586 --> 00:56:15.798
You said you'd take him off my hands.

573
00:56:41.533 --> 00:56:44.703
I know there's something
you're not telling me.

574
00:56:45.745 --> 00:56:47.997
Don't let him watch the news.

575
00:57:14.273 --> 00:57:17.360
<i>Well, traffic on the FDR
right now is looking pretty heavy,</i>

576
00:57:17.443 --> 00:57:19.738
<i>this gridlock we're looking at
probably won't let up for hours.</i>

577
00:57:19.821 --> 00:57:23.074
<i>Most of this traffic is headed
downtown to the Westside...</i>

578
00:58:11.455 --> 00:58:13.332
Why hasn't this intersection
been sealed off?

579
00:58:13.416 --> 00:58:14.458
Excuse me?

580
00:58:14.543 --> 00:58:16.753
I said why hasn't this intersection
been sealed off?

581
00:58:16.836 --> 00:58:20.007
- Didn't you get the tip-off about the attack?
- Sir. Sir, please calm down.

582
00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:24.637
If you'll accompany me,
we'll get this matter taken care of.

583
00:58:24.679 --> 00:58:25.971
Sir, stop!

584
00:58:26.013 --> 00:58:27.973
Hey, man.
Stop!

585
00:58:31.185 --> 00:58:33.813
I got him. Let's go! Move! Move!

586
00:59:55.269 --> 00:59:57.605
Suspect sighted. Platform three.

587
01:00:04.029 --> 01:00:05.363
Hey!

588
01:00:06.948 --> 01:00:08.909
Out of the way! Let me through!

589
01:00:08.992 --> 01:00:10.536
Forward car.

590
01:00:21.588 --> 01:00:23.048
- Get off the train.
- Why? What's wrong?

591
01:00:23.131 --> 01:00:24.340
Just take the baby and get off the train.

592
01:00:24.382 --> 01:00:26.176
What's your problem, pal?

593
01:00:26.217 --> 01:00:28.469
Hold it right there, sir.

594
01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:32.599
Transit police. I'm asking you to stop!

595
01:00:32.683 --> 01:00:35.226
That's him! You have to stop him!

596
01:00:39.147 --> 01:00:42.192
Transit police. Turn around.

597
01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:45.028
Now!

598
01:00:45.821 --> 01:00:47.906
Put your hands up!

599
01:00:47.989 --> 01:00:51.242
Please! Please, I won't do it again,
I promise! I'll give them back!

600
01:00:51.326 --> 01:00:54.120
I'll give them back! I'll give them back.

601
01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:00.919
<i>Next stop, Spring.</i>

602
01:01:23.149 --> 01:01:25.819
Move back! Move back!

603
01:01:32.408 --> 01:01:34.160
Get out of the way!

604
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:43.606
Move outside.

605
01:03:28.151 --> 01:03:32.155
<i>Make their way through
the massive tangle of wreckage...</i>

606
01:03:32.197 --> 01:03:35.325
<i>... New York City subway disaster since...</i>

607
01:03:35.408 --> 01:03:37.244
<i>It could be the result of a terrorist plot...</i>

608
01:03:37.244 --> 01:03:39.246
<i>Federal Aviation Administration officials</i>

609
01:03:39.287 --> 01:03:42.708
<i>are investigating a possible link
to the electrostatic bursts</i>

610
01:03:42.791 --> 01:03:46.419
<i>believed to have caused
the Lexington air disaster of two days ago.</i>

611
01:03:46.504 --> 01:03:50.090
<i>And NO AA, the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration,</i>

612
01:03:50.173 --> 01:03:52.134
<i>remains silent tonight.</i>

613
01:03:52.217 --> 01:03:55.220
<i>But with the devastating subway crash
in Manhattan,</i>

614
01:03:55.303 --> 01:03:57.848
<i>power cuts in Long Island
and two more emergency...</i>

615
01:03:57.931 --> 01:04:02.645
Grace. I got held up by work.
I'll be over in 30 minutes.

616
01:04:04.855 --> 01:04:07.775
No, I'm fine. I'll see you in 30 minutes.

617
01:04:09.568 --> 01:04:12.070
Three, four, five...
Five, six...

618
01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:38.639
Caleb, go inside.

619
01:04:41.391 --> 01:04:43.185
- Hey.
- Hi.

620
01:04:43.226 --> 01:04:46.522
- Want to check out the house?
- Sure.

621
01:04:52.986 --> 01:04:54.948
You said October 19th?

622
01:04:57.909 --> 01:05:01.370
My mother used to talk about that day
all the time.

623
01:05:04.999 --> 01:05:06.585
She said it was the day I was going to die.

624
01:05:21.099 --> 01:05:25.562
All my life I've had this thing
hanging over my head

625
01:05:25.645 --> 01:05:27.105
and Abby's.

626
01:05:29.107 --> 01:05:32.443
I just don't believe
anyone can predict my future.

627
01:05:35.404 --> 01:05:37.907
And what does it matter, anyway?

628
01:05:40.034 --> 01:05:41.953
We all die in the end.

629
01:05:44.163 --> 01:05:47.125
I don't want to know what my future holds.

630
01:05:53.339 --> 01:05:58.427
Last year, my wife was on
a business trip to Phoenix

631
01:05:59.387 --> 01:06:01.848
a few days before my birthday

632
01:06:02.932 --> 01:06:08.730
and a fire started in her hotel
at 4:00 in the morning.

633
01:06:10.857 --> 01:06:14.235
The investigators said
that Allison died of smoke inhalation.

634
01:06:14.318 --> 01:06:16.863
Died in her sleep.

635
01:06:16.946 --> 01:06:20.074
She wouldn't have known
anything about it.

636
01:06:22.994 --> 01:06:27.624
While she was dying,
I was at home, in the front yard.

637
01:06:30.209 --> 01:06:32.170
I always thought
you were supposed to sense

638
01:06:32.211 --> 01:06:35.007
when the people you love are in danger,

639
01:06:37.552 --> 01:06:39.720
but I didn't feel anything.

640
01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:42.389
Nothing.

641
01:06:45.267 --> 01:06:50.147
I was just blowing leaves off the lawn.

642
01:06:52.024 --> 01:06:53.984
I'm so sorry, John.

643
01:06:54.026 --> 01:06:58.322
Well, but my point is that from then on,

644
01:06:58.405 --> 01:07:03.536
I decided that no one can know
what was coming,

645
01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:10.668
and life was just a string
of random accidents and mistakes.

646
01:07:13.963 --> 01:07:16.507
And then I got that list.

647
01:07:19.927 --> 01:07:25.265
If that had come to me before Allison left,
I would have saved her life.

648
01:07:29.269 --> 01:07:30.938
I need to know.

649
01:07:57.214 --> 01:07:58.883
It's still here.

650
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:29.330
What's this?

651
01:08:30.749 --> 01:08:32.584
Have you seen this?

652
01:08:34.127 --> 01:08:38.214
Abby used to do this sometimes,
write things backwards,

653
01:08:39.215 --> 01:08:42.260
and that last number, I don't think it's 33.

654
01:08:43.136 --> 01:08:44.596
It's EE.

655
01:08:47.015 --> 01:08:51.311
EE? Initials. Someone she knew?

656
01:08:52.854 --> 01:08:54.355
I don't know.

657
01:09:18.296 --> 01:09:20.674
I was nine when she overdosed.

658
01:09:22.008 --> 01:09:25.428
The only time I ever came out here
was with my father

659
01:09:26.513 --> 01:09:29.390
when he identified her body.

660
01:09:29.474 --> 01:09:31.935
She willed the property to me,

661
01:09:34.312 --> 01:09:37.357
but I never came back for any of her things.

662
01:09:54.083 --> 01:09:58.588
When I was little, my mother used
to tell me that she could hear voices

663
01:10:00.673 --> 01:10:02.800
whispering to her,

664
01:10:04.636 --> 01:10:07.138
telling her horrible things.

665
01:10:08.347 --> 01:10:12.977
And then one day,
my dad came and took me away from her.

666
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:16.397
He said she was sick.

667
01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:24.238
She said she moved out here to get ready.

668
01:10:26.448 --> 01:10:29.160
I never knew what she meant by that.

669
01:10:34.373 --> 01:10:37.084
I made this for her one Christmas.

670
01:10:42.339 --> 01:10:44.551
I never knew she kept it.

671
01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:37.605
She used to stare at this picture for hours.

672
01:11:53.537 --> 01:11:55.706
That's where they found her.

673
01:11:58.083 --> 01:11:59.502
In there.

674
01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:32.284
Have you seen enough?

675
01:12:33.869 --> 01:12:35.788
Yeah. Okay. We'll go.

676
01:12:54.347 --> 01:12:55.516
Abby?

677
01:12:56.308 --> 01:12:57.518
Abby?

678
01:13:19.248 --> 01:13:21.960
<i>Abby.</i>

679
01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:32.386
<i>Caleb.</i>

680
01:13:39.686 --> 01:13:41.187
<i>Come.</i>

681
01:13:42.564 --> 01:13:45.108
<i>Come with us.</i>

682
01:13:56.745 --> 01:13:58.788
EE isn't just one person.

683
01:14:16.264 --> 01:14:17.599
Abby, no!

684
01:14:27.191 --> 01:14:28.442
Abby!

685
01:14:29.027 --> 01:14:32.656
What? What? What? It's okay. It's okay.

686
01:14:32.781 --> 01:14:34.407
They were here.

687
01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:37.326
Who? Who was here, Caleb?

688
01:14:37.410 --> 01:14:41.956
- Did they hurt you?
- No. They were talking to us.

689
01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:47.379
- What did they say?
- I don't know. They were all talking at once.

690
01:14:47.462 --> 01:14:51.341
They said we could go with them,
if we chose to.

691
01:14:53.093 --> 01:14:58.057
- Who did, baby? Who?
- The whisper people.

692
01:15:15.074 --> 01:15:17.034
Hey, lock the doors.

693
01:15:40.307 --> 01:15:42.560
What do you want with my son?

694
01:15:48.273 --> 01:15:49.650
Answer me!

695
01:16:20.347 --> 01:16:22.767
I just know they've been following us
for days.

696
01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:26.062
I think someone's been following me
and Abby, too.

697
01:16:35.531 --> 01:16:39.535
That's why she didn't write
any coordinates down after the final date.

698
01:16:39.618 --> 01:16:42.871
There isn't a single location this time.

699
01:16:42.913 --> 01:16:48.043
Are you telling me that my mother
could see the end of everything?

700
01:16:50.128 --> 01:16:53.173
That we're all going to die tomorrow?

701
01:16:53.256 --> 01:16:58.887
She was disturbed, John.
She could've just made it all up.

702
01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:02.516
She's been right so far, Diana.

703
01:17:04.851 --> 01:17:06.562
About everything.

704
01:17:08.939 --> 01:17:12.776
Abby's... Abby's all I've got, John.

705
01:17:12.859 --> 01:17:15.445
I can't let anything happen to her.

706
01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:16.966
Caleb, you really need to sleep.

707
01:18:20.803 --> 01:18:24.974
I can hear them whispering to me
sometimes like Abby can.

708
01:18:26.308 --> 01:18:28.603
Could Lucinda hear them, too?

709
01:18:35.818 --> 01:18:37.987
Yeah, I think she did. Yes.

710
01:18:39.989 --> 01:18:42.116
Are me and Abby gonna die?

711
01:18:46.328 --> 01:18:51.167
No. I will never let that happen, Caleb.

712
01:18:52.251 --> 01:18:54.712
Do you hear me? Never.

713
01:18:59.551 --> 01:19:00.885
You...

714
01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:21.989
Abby, what do you like to eat for breakfast?

715
01:19:23.365 --> 01:19:24.617
Abby?

716
01:19:27.579 --> 01:19:29.706
What are you doing, honey?

717
01:19:31.123 --> 01:19:32.625
It's the sun.

718
01:19:38.590 --> 01:19:41.969
There's something I need to check.
Get Abby, you're coming with us.

719
01:19:42.052 --> 01:19:43.178
Caleb!

720
01:20:00.946 --> 01:20:03.073
Okay. All right.

721
01:20:03.156 --> 01:20:05.283
Hey, John, what happened?

722
01:20:08.203 --> 01:20:09.454
Hey!

723
01:20:12.165 --> 01:20:13.291
Talk to me. What happened?

724
01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:17.713
I've been calling you off the hook
ever since I heard about the subway.

725
01:20:18.672 --> 01:20:19.840
John?

726
01:20:23.468 --> 01:20:26.388
Do you remember that paper
on extra-solar activity I published?

727
01:20:26.429 --> 01:20:27.806
Yeah, sure, I remember.

728
01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:32.102
I found evidence of a series of super-flares
from a star in the outer-Pleiades region.

729
01:20:32.144 --> 01:20:34.354
Right. Ratings were off the chart.

730
01:20:36.273 --> 01:20:39.276
We were both wrong.
The numbers are a warning,

731
01:20:39.317 --> 01:20:42.154
but not just to me or any random group.

732
01:20:44.197 --> 01:20:46.449
They're a warning to everyone.

733
01:20:48.702 --> 01:20:51.914
Okay. You're officially scaring
the shit out of me right now.

734
01:20:53.999 --> 01:20:58.295
The super-flare, in our own solar system.

735
01:20:59.254 --> 01:21:01.549
A 100 microtesla wave of radiation

736
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:06.804
that would destroy our ozone layer,
killing every living organism on the planet.

737
01:21:13.476 --> 01:21:15.979
We have to let everyone know.
We have to call the NOAA.

738
01:21:16.021 --> 01:21:19.692
They already know.
The announcement will come anytime now.

739
01:21:35.249 --> 01:21:38.837
I thought there was some purpose
to all of this.

740
01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:43.174
Why did I get this prediction
if there's nothing I can do about it?

741
01:21:44.926 --> 01:21:48.137
How am I supposed
to stop the end of the world?

742
01:21:56.270 --> 01:21:59.691
Go home, Phil. Be with Kim tonight.

743
01:22:15.707 --> 01:22:17.250
Diana.

744
01:22:19.293 --> 01:22:21.671
I'm so stupid.

745
01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:26.050
I've spent my whole life
knowing she was right

746
01:22:27.468 --> 01:22:30.221
and pretending that she was insane.

747
01:22:33.892 --> 01:22:37.353
If we hide underground,
we've got a chance, don't we?

748
01:22:38.855 --> 01:22:40.481
It's possible.

749
01:22:41.399 --> 01:22:47.030
I know some caves
off Route 40 past Groton.

750
01:22:47.113 --> 01:22:51.826
Hardly anyone knows about them,
but I used to play there as a child.

751
01:22:51.868 --> 01:22:54.203
We could try there, right?

752
01:22:54.954 --> 01:22:57.123
- Okay.
- Okay.

753
01:23:00.586 --> 01:23:02.588
Caleb, put some clothes and shoes
into your backpack.

754
01:23:02.672 --> 01:23:06.383
Diana, load all the non-perishable food,
any water you can, into the truck.

755
01:23:06.466 --> 01:23:08.135
Let's try to be out of here in 10 minutes.

756
01:23:08.135 --> 01:23:10.763
You start. I'll get some bags.
Yeah.

757
01:24:18.623 --> 01:24:21.000
<i>Allison wanted me to call you</i>

758
01:24:22.502 --> 01:24:25.087
the day she left for Phoenix.

759
01:24:25.170 --> 01:24:28.340
She wanted me to promise her
that I'd call you.

760
01:24:29.509 --> 01:24:31.343
<i>I know, Jonathan.</i>

761
01:24:33.596 --> 01:24:38.810
We haven't spoken in so long,
I don't really even know why anymore.

762
01:24:43.439 --> 01:24:45.859
I need to tell you something.

763
01:24:46.777 --> 01:24:48.153
<i>Yes?</i>

764
01:24:49.237 --> 01:24:54.284
That sermon you preached every year
at Pentecost, about the gifts of the Spirit,

765
01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:57.579
one was the gift of prophecy.

766
01:24:57.663 --> 01:25:03.459
<i>1 Corinthians 12. Yes, I remember it.
The church should respect the prophet.</i>

767
01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:06.755
I have a prophecy.

768
01:25:08.674 --> 01:25:11.176
It's about to be proven accurate.

769
01:25:13.887 --> 01:25:17.683
I need you to respect it
and receive it as the truth.

770
01:25:18.767 --> 01:25:21.770
This heat we're experiencing
isn't going to get better.

771
01:25:22.938 --> 01:25:26.399
<i>It's going to get worse, much worse.</i>

772
01:25:28.276 --> 01:25:31.446
I need you to get Mom and Grace
and any supplies you can,

773
01:25:31.530 --> 01:25:36.034
and get below ground tonight.
The basement, the sewer, the T.

774
01:25:36.117 --> 01:25:39.621
Just get as deep as you can
and as fast as you can.

775
01:25:41.289 --> 01:25:44.375
And that will keep us safe from this heat?

776
01:25:47.337 --> 01:25:51.633
I don't know that, but we have to try, right?

777
01:25:53.218 --> 01:25:57.055
<i>I'm sorry, John, but I'm afraid I'm not
going anywhere tonight or any night.</i>

778
01:25:57.138 --> 01:26:01.727
I appreciate your concern,
but if it's my time, it's my time.

779
01:26:03.061 --> 01:26:06.607
I'm ready whenever the good Lord calls me.

780
01:26:06.690 --> 01:26:08.358
<i>Are you?</i>

781
01:26:08.441 --> 01:26:09.943
<i>- Dad?
- Hello?</i>

782
01:26:11.277 --> 01:26:12.863
- John?
- Dad?

783
01:26:27.837 --> 01:26:29.589
Caleb, let's go!

784
01:26:31.758 --> 01:26:32.967
Caleb.

785
01:26:36.846 --> 01:26:38.097
Caleb.

786
01:26:46.022 --> 01:26:47.273
Caleb!

787
01:26:50.317 --> 01:26:51.903
Caleb, stop!

788
01:26:54.071 --> 01:26:56.323
- Caleb!
- Huh? Huh?

789
01:26:57.324 --> 01:26:59.160
What were you doing?

790
01:27:00.119 --> 01:27:01.829
Did I do that?

791
01:27:11.964 --> 01:27:13.925
This isn't the way to the highway.

792
01:27:19.722 --> 01:27:21.599
Everybody wait here.

793
01:27:23.893 --> 01:27:25.102
John!

794
01:27:28.523 --> 01:27:29.816
John!

795
01:28:05.185 --> 01:28:08.146
John, please, why are we back here?

796
01:28:13.151 --> 01:28:16.864
John, please, what are you doing?
We have to get to the caves.

797
01:28:16.905 --> 01:28:20.367
- We're not going to the caves.
- What?

798
01:28:20.408 --> 01:28:22.119
She knew the coordinates
for this last event.

799
01:28:22.202 --> 01:28:23.537
She tried to write them down.

800
01:28:23.621 --> 01:28:27.791
The teacher said she was interrupted,
ran out of time,

801
01:28:27.875 --> 01:28:31.211
so she scratched them into this door.

802
01:28:31.294 --> 01:28:33.296
She tried to tell us where to go.

803
01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:36.800
You're not making any sense.
Look at you. Look at what you're doing!

804
01:28:36.842 --> 01:28:38.927
The numbers are the key to everything.

805
01:28:39.011 --> 01:28:41.889
Please! Please, John, we need to leave!

806
01:28:49.354 --> 01:28:53.358
We're taking my car. Come on.
Let's go. Keep your bags with you.

807
01:28:56.779 --> 01:28:58.864
Be here, please, be here.

808
01:28:59.823 --> 01:29:01.700
Throw it in the back.

809
01:29:05.913 --> 01:29:07.372
What about Dad?

810
01:29:07.455 --> 01:29:11.418
He's just gotta finish what he's doing.
He's gonna follow us.

811
01:29:11.502 --> 01:29:13.461
We're just getting a head start, okay?

812
01:29:35.359 --> 01:29:36.820
Diana?

813
01:29:46.871 --> 01:29:48.081
Caleb!

814
01:29:49.666 --> 01:29:50.959
Caleb!

815
01:29:53.294 --> 01:29:54.671
Caleb!

816
01:29:56.339 --> 01:29:57.716
Caleb!

817
01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:26.202
Where are we going, Mom?
Are we hiding from the whisper people?

818
01:30:26.285 --> 01:30:31.082
Yes, baby.
They won't find us where we're going.

819
01:30:31.165 --> 01:30:33.752
Mom, they know where we are.

820
01:30:35.336 --> 01:30:38.381
- How do you know that?
- They told us so.

821
01:30:39.465 --> 01:30:43.887
- You've seen them again?
- No. They just talk to us.

822
01:30:46.681 --> 01:30:49.893
How, Abby? How do they talk to you?

823
01:30:49.976 --> 01:30:52.937
They whisper into our heads.

824
01:30:54.105 --> 01:30:55.356
Oh, God.

825
01:31:03.907 --> 01:31:05.199
Oh, God.

826
01:31:05.283 --> 01:31:07.410
- I want to call my dad.
- The phones are down!

827
01:31:07.493 --> 01:31:11.247
I promise he's right behind us!
We'll call him when we get there!

828
01:31:21.175 --> 01:31:22.843
Wait right here!

829
01:31:22.885 --> 01:31:26.013
<i>Now let's get back to the
financial markets, if we may, for a moment.</i>

830
01:31:26.055 --> 01:31:29.308
<i>Let's check it out on the grid here this
morning. We've got Treasuries moving up...</i>

831
01:31:29.433 --> 01:31:31.852
Yeah, thanks. Thanks, man.

832
01:31:32.687 --> 01:31:33.688
Number five.

833
01:31:33.729 --> 01:31:35.898
<i>... India is a better bet than the US
or Europe,</i>

834
01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:38.568
<i>and that the dollar will continue
its long slide...</i>

835
01:31:38.609 --> 01:31:39.652
20.

836
01:31:39.735 --> 01:31:42.279
<i>This is an Emergency
Broadcast Transmission.</i>

837
01:31:45.324 --> 01:31:49.954
<i>This is not a test. This is
an Emergency Broadcast Transmission.</i>

838
01:31:51.706 --> 01:31:54.374
<i>Today, NO AA has concluded...
- Turn that up!</i>

839
01:31:54.499 --> 01:31:55.876
<i>... the solar flares may last longer</i>

840
01:31:55.918 --> 01:31:59.338
<i>and cause more damage to our
infrastructure than we originally thought.</i>

841
01:31:59.421 --> 01:32:02.341
<i>We're recommending that people
stay indoors until further notice.</i>

842
01:32:02.382 --> 01:32:05.720
<i>Bring your pets inside.
Stock up on extra water and, if possible,</i>

843
01:32:05.803 --> 01:32:08.556
<i>seek out fortified underground shelter.</i>

844
01:32:08.639 --> 01:32:12.727
<i>- General, what time is it happening?
- General, excuse me...</i>

845
01:32:19.149 --> 01:32:22.027
<i>The shelters we have
are currently overwhelmed.</i>

846
01:32:22.111 --> 01:32:24.905
<i>The best advice we can offer the public
is to seek your own.</i>

847
01:32:24.989 --> 01:32:25.990
<i>Sir!</i>

848
01:32:26.073 --> 01:32:27.491
<i>One more question about the warning.</i>

849
01:32:27.533 --> 01:32:29.619
<i>We are assessing this information
as it becomes available.</i>

850
01:32:29.702 --> 01:32:30.786
<i>It was only recently confirmed.</i>

851
01:32:30.911 --> 01:32:32.121
<i>Where is the President?</i>

852
01:32:32.204 --> 01:32:33.372
<i>The President and his staff</i>

853
01:32:33.455 --> 01:32:36.834
<i>are currently being transported
to a secure location.</i>

854
01:32:36.876 --> 01:32:37.918
<i>Hello?
- Dad?</i>

855
01:32:38.002 --> 01:32:41.547
Caleb, are you okay?
Tell me exactly where you are.

856
01:32:41.631 --> 01:32:44.133
We're at a gas station. I don't know where.

857
01:32:48.929 --> 01:32:52.267
<i>The damage information regarding
the destructive power of these flares</i>

858
01:32:52.308 --> 01:32:54.144
<i>is a scientific matter,
and I'm not gonna speculate...</i>

859
01:32:54.227 --> 01:32:55.771
Are you coming with us?

860
01:32:55.854 --> 01:32:58.231
<i>I need you to stay right there.
Get me an...</i>

861
01:32:58.314 --> 01:33:00.567
Caleb, get back to the car now.

862
01:33:00.651 --> 01:33:01.818
<i>Caleb?
- John?</i>

863
01:33:01.902 --> 01:33:03.779
<i>- Where are you?
We're in Westford.</i>

864
01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:07.198
I'm sorry.
I had to do this for Abby and for Caleb.

865
01:33:07.282 --> 01:33:10.076
- I'm taking them to the caves.
- I found the numbers!

866
01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:12.162
They're the location
of your mother's mobile home.

867
01:33:12.245 --> 01:33:13.705
That's where we've got to go.

868
01:33:13.789 --> 01:33:17.333
- Don't do this to me. Please.
- I know how it sounds.

869
01:33:17.417 --> 01:33:19.961
You want us to head toward the place
where this is supposed to happen?

870
01:33:20.045 --> 01:33:21.046
<i>Are you insane?</i>

871
01:33:21.129 --> 01:33:23.757
It's a chance we gotta take
or we're all gonna die!

872
01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:25.592
Stay where you are! I'll be right there!

873
01:33:25.634 --> 01:33:27.928
No! If we go to the caves,
we have a chance!

874
01:33:28.011 --> 01:33:29.971
You said the sun can't reach that far!

875
01:33:30.055 --> 01:33:33.725
The caves won't save us! Nothing can!

876
01:33:34.309 --> 01:33:37.938
The radiation will penetrate a mile
into the Earth's crust! Do you hear me?

877
01:33:38.021 --> 01:33:40.356
<i>Our only shot is to go
where the numbers want us to go.</i>

878
01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:43.234
<i>- It's what we're meant to do!
- No, I don't believe you!</i>

879
01:33:43.318 --> 01:33:45.571
I'm taking the children!
We have to save the children!

880
01:33:45.654 --> 01:33:50.617
<i>Don't you move, Diana! Caleb is my son,
and I'll decide where he goes!</i>

881
01:33:52.035 --> 01:33:55.163
<i>Diana! Caleb! Are you there?</i>

882
01:34:03.129 --> 01:34:04.380
Abby!

883
01:34:06.299 --> 01:34:08.760
Abby! Abby!

884
01:34:09.553 --> 01:34:12.598
Help! Somebody took my daughter!

885
01:34:25.026 --> 01:34:26.486
Abby!

886
01:34:35.371 --> 01:34:36.748
Damn it!

887
01:35:14.076 --> 01:35:15.787
Where did she go?

888
01:35:57.453 --> 01:35:59.288
<i>Everyone needs to do this immediately.</i>

889
01:35:59.371 --> 01:36:02.249
<i>We are facing a natural threat
of global proportions,</i>

890
01:36:02.333 --> 01:36:04.126
<i>and there is very little
that this government...</i>

891
01:36:04.210 --> 01:36:06.170
Same thing happened with Y2K.

892
01:36:06.253 --> 01:36:09.883
They are gonna wake up tomorrow morning
feeling pretty stupid.

893
01:36:09.967 --> 01:36:12.344
Thirty minutes ago there was
a woman here. She was screaming!

894
01:36:12.427 --> 01:36:15.848
She was with a kid! He was on your
pay phone! He's a nine-year-old kid!

895
01:36:15.889 --> 01:36:19.518
Some guy took the lady's car
with the kids inside. Drove right off with it.

896
01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:22.187
- The woman, where'd she go?
- That way!

897
01:36:23.606 --> 01:36:25.691
Go lock the door! Stop that, you crazy...

898
01:36:25.774 --> 01:36:29.111
You've got to pay for that! Hey, stop!

899
01:36:29.194 --> 01:36:31.113
<i>You need to
seek protection from the sun</i>

900
01:36:31.196 --> 01:36:32.865
<i>and it needs to be immediately.</i>

901
01:36:32.948 --> 01:36:35.325
<i>We're facing a deadly threat.</i>

902
01:36:46.837 --> 01:36:49.006
Get out!
I didn't see you!

903
01:36:59.224 --> 01:37:01.059
Hey! Get out of here!

904
01:37:07.315 --> 01:37:11.319
- Is she... Where are the children?
- We can't help you now, sir.

905
01:37:20.996 --> 01:37:23.624
Calm down, all of you!
Just calm down!

906
01:37:25.501 --> 01:37:26.710
Charge.

907
01:37:28.128 --> 01:37:29.505
Clear.

908
01:37:33.466 --> 01:37:35.135
Again.

909
01:37:35.177 --> 01:37:36.554
Clear.

910
01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:46.188
- Okay, call it.
- 12:00 midnight exactly.

911
01:37:47.273 --> 01:37:49.776
There's a man down. We need help.

912
01:38:15.844 --> 01:38:17.178
Diana.

913
01:38:21.683 --> 01:38:23.184
I'm sorry.

914
01:40:30.813 --> 01:40:32.147
Caleb!

915
01:40:53.794 --> 01:40:55.254
Where is he?

916
01:40:56.589 --> 01:40:58.257
Where's Caleb?

917
01:40:58.966 --> 01:41:00.467
I want my son!

918
01:41:01.886 --> 01:41:04.304
I want my son!

919
01:41:05.641 --> 01:41:07.017
Now!

920
01:41:07.142 --> 01:41:08.351
Dad, don't!

921
01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:19.905
Are you hurt? What did he do to you?

922
01:41:19.988 --> 01:41:23.617
It's okay, Dad. I'm okay. This is my friend.

923
01:41:25.076 --> 01:41:27.203
They said I can keep him.

924
01:41:34.210 --> 01:41:36.129
Caleb, I want you to come with me.
We're going now.

925
01:41:36.212 --> 01:41:38.464
But we have to go with them.

926
01:41:40.050 --> 01:41:41.885
They won't hurt us.

927
01:41:43.261 --> 01:41:45.972
Abby, are you okay?

928
01:41:46.765 --> 01:41:49.392
- Your mom wanted to be here, honey.
I know.

929
01:41:49.475 --> 01:41:52.688
The whisper people told me
that Mommy's safe now.

930
01:41:52.771 --> 01:41:55.691
They've been protecting us all along, Dad.

931
01:41:55.774 --> 01:41:59.570
They sent a message ahead of them
to prepare the way,

932
01:41:59.653 --> 01:42:01.863
and now they've come for us.

933
01:42:04.741 --> 01:42:06.284
Who are you?

934
01:43:01.298 --> 01:43:05.970
It's time to go, Dad.
They've chosen us so we can start over.

935
01:43:06.053 --> 01:43:08.430
So everything can start over.

936
01:43:46.135 --> 01:43:49.681
What do you mean? I don't understand.

937
01:43:53.810 --> 01:43:56.145
Why is he saying that, Dad?

938
01:43:57.104 --> 01:43:58.397
What?

939
01:43:59.857 --> 01:44:02.026
What's he saying, Caleb?

940
01:44:02.109 --> 01:44:05.738
He's saying only the chosen must go,

941
01:44:07.907 --> 01:44:10.034
those who heard the call.

942
01:44:14.831 --> 01:44:16.290
Please.

943
01:44:52.494 --> 01:44:57.249
I can't go with you, Caleb.
I mean, I can't go with you.

944
01:44:58.333 --> 01:45:00.753
They've chosen us to go.

945
01:45:02.546 --> 01:45:04.923
They haven't chosen us, Caleb.

946
01:45:06.341 --> 01:45:09.302
They've chosen you, both of you.

947
01:45:13.807 --> 01:45:18.103
You have to take care of Abby now.
You have to be strong for her.

948
01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:26.236
No. I don't want to go without you.

949
01:45:27.905 --> 01:45:32.117
They could've taken you away from me,
but they didn't,

950
01:45:33.118 --> 01:45:36.288
because you have to make
this decision yourself.

951
01:45:36.371 --> 01:45:38.749
But you promised.

952
01:45:38.832 --> 01:45:42.169
You said we'd be together forever.

953
01:45:42.210 --> 01:45:46.757
We will be. We will be. I'm not leaving you.

954
01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:50.553
But you gotta go with them.
You gotta go. You gotta go with them.

955
01:45:50.594 --> 01:45:55.390
Caleb, Caleb, listen to me, Caleb.
Stop, stop. Stop. Listen to me. Listen.

956
01:45:55.432 --> 01:45:59.144
We're gonna be together.
We're all gonna be together.

957
01:45:59.186 --> 01:46:01.189
And Mom's gonna be with us, too.

958
01:46:01.230 --> 01:46:05.026
I know it. I know that now. I know it.

959
01:46:07.153 --> 01:46:10.615
Look. Here. Take this.

960
01:46:10.699 --> 01:46:13.827
Take this. Keep it with you.

961
01:46:15.161 --> 01:46:17.831
One day, you'll know what it means.

962
01:46:25.338 --> 01:46:27.048
I love you, Daddy.

963
01:52:43.721 --> 01:52:45.263
Where's Caleb?

964
01:52:46.473 --> 01:52:48.100
Caleb's safe.

965
01:52:49.727 --> 01:52:52.563
<i>We're going to stay on the air
for as long as possible.</i>

966
01:52:53.647 --> 01:52:56.984
<i>All we can say is what
we've been repeating all morning.</i>

967
01:52:57.067 --> 01:52:59.862
<i>Get to any kind of underground shelter.</i>

968
01:53:01.864 --> 01:53:04.241
<i>We've been told the satellite...</i>

969
01:53:21.717 --> 01:53:24.261
This isn't the end, Son.

970
01:53:24.344 --> 01:53:25.679
I know.
