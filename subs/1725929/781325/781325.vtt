(SCREAMS) Where?

521
00:29:16.821 --> 00:29:19.119
(EXCLAIMING) Are they cute creatures?

<i>I certainly hope
you don't mean us,</i>

523
00:29:21.459 --> 00:29:23.723

not creatures.

and Glimmer.

525
00:29:27.098 --> 00:29:28.656
You're fairies?

526
00:29:28.733 --> 00:29:32.863
Fairies have wings.
Observe. No wings.

527
00:29:33.304 --> 00:29:36.933
We're Flairies.
We have flair.

528

533
00:29:51.656 --> 00:29:55.183
So, you're the designer.
A pleasure working with ya.

534
00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:59.458
Working with me? Oh, I
just made a plain dress.

535
00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:01.829
You are the ones
who beautified it.

536
00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:04.931

you live in the Glitterizer?

<i>(LAUGHS) We don't live in it. We travel.</i>

538

We go where we're summoned, and
help designers all over the world.

539
00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:15.078
Exactly. We come
when we're called,

540
00:30:15.146 --> 00:30:19.014
and if we like what we see, we
add shimmer, glimmer, and shine.

<i>I'm still learning.</i>

543
00:30:24.455 --> 00:30:26.980
We came to life
in this fashion house.

<i>It's our home and the
source of our powers.</i>

545
00:30:30.128 --> 00:30:33.723
Wait, if the fashion house
is the source of your powers,

546
00:30:33.798 --> 00:30:35.959
would it be really,
really bad

547
00:30:36.034 --> 00:30:39.697
if someone gutted it on Saturday
and made it a hot dog place?

548
00:30:39.771 --> 00:30:43.639
<i>(LAUGHING) A hot dog
place? That's so funny.</i>

549
00:30:47.212 --> 00:30:48.770
It is a joke, right?

551
00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:55.178
<i>Which sounds like a joke,
but it's not.</i>

552
00:30:55.353 --> 00:30:58.015
But Shyne, if the
fashion house is gutted,

553
00:30:58.089 --> 00:30:59.920
<i>won't we lose
our powers?</i>

554
00:30:59.991 --> 00:31:01.583
Not on my watch.

<i>Uh, Millicent, and she's
down in her office, but...</i>

Flairies, fall in.

559
00:31:12.136 --> 00:31:14.866
We're going to give this
Millicent a piece of our mind.

They're unloading us in a minute,
no clue when we'll take off again.
