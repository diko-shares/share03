1
00:00:48.817 --> 00:00:51.278
Rachel, let me see.

2
00:00:57.367 --> 00:01:00.495
- Can I see?
- Finders keepers. And I found it.

3
00:01:00.662 --> 00:01:02.205
In my garden.

4
00:01:03.915 --> 00:01:05.750
Finders keepers.

5
00:01:12.716 --> 00:01:14.217
Bruce?

6
00:01:19.222 --> 00:01:20.932
Bruce?

7
00:01:23.268 --> 00:01:25.729
Mom! Mr. Alfred!

8
00:01:48.668 --> 00:01:50.837
Did you have dream?

9
00:01:51.296 --> 00:01:53.173
Nightmare.

10
00:01:57.552 --> 00:01:59.012
Worse than this place?

11
00:02:21.034 --> 00:02:22.994
They are going to fight you.

12
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.996
- Again?
- Until they kill you.

13
00:02:27.207 --> 00:02:29.000
Can they kill me before breakfast?

14
00:02:31.378 --> 00:02:34.214
You are in hell, little man.

15
00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:40.303
And I am the devil.

16
00:02:43.682 --> 00:02:45.141
You're not the devil.

17
00:02:45.308 --> 00:02:46.685
You're practice.

18
00:03:30.145 --> 00:03:31.438
Solitary.

19
00:03:31.605 --> 00:03:33.523
- Why?
- For protection.

20
00:03:34.232 --> 00:03:36.568
- I don't need protection.
- Protection for them.

21
00:03:40.238 --> 00:03:42.240
Get in.

22
00:03:46.202 --> 00:03:48.246
Are you so desperate
to fight criminals...

23
00:03:48.413 --> 00:03:51.082
...that you lock yourself in
to take them on one at a time?

24
00:03:52.334 --> 00:03:56.254
Actually, there were seven of them.

25
00:03:56.421 --> 00:03:58.715
I counted six, Mr. Wayne.

26
00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:03.720
How do you know my name?

27
00:04:03.887 --> 00:04:06.932
The world is too small for someone
like Bruce Wayne to disappear...

28
00:04:07.098 --> 00:04:09.434
...no matter how deep
he chooses to sink.

29
00:04:09.601 --> 00:04:10.769
Who are you?

30
00:04:10.936 --> 00:04:14.105
My name is merely Ducard,
but I speak for Ra's al Ghul...

31
00:04:14.272 --> 00:04:17.901
...a man greatly feared
by the criminal underworld.

32
00:04:18.068 --> 00:04:19.653
A man who can offer you a path.

33
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.073
What makes you think I need a path?

34
00:04:23.448 --> 00:04:26.076
Someone like you
is only here by choice.

35
00:04:26.243 --> 00:04:28.620
You have been exploring
the criminal fraternity...

36
00:04:28.787 --> 00:04:31.248
...but whatever
your original intentions...

37
00:04:31.957 --> 00:04:35.293
...you have become truly lost.

38
00:04:36.836 --> 00:04:40.632
And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?

39
00:04:40.799 --> 00:04:44.803
The path of a man
who shares his hatred of evil...

40
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.181
...and wishes to serve true justice.

41
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.767
The path of the League of Shadows.

42
00:04:53.853 --> 00:04:56.147
- You're vigilantes.
- No, no, no.

43
00:04:56.314 --> 00:05:00.485
A vigilante is just a man lost in
the scramble for his own gratification.

44
00:05:00.652 --> 00:05:04.322
He can be destroyed or locked up.

45
00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:10.495
But if you make yourself more
than just a man...

46
00:05:10.662 --> 00:05:13.665
...if you devote yourself to an ideal...

47
00:05:13.832 --> 00:05:16.334
...and if they can't stop you...

48
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.170
...then you become
something else entirely.

49
00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:22.382
Which is?

50
00:05:22.882 --> 00:05:25.844
Legend, Mr. Wayne.

51
00:05:27.178 --> 00:05:28.805
Tomorrow, you will be released.

52
00:05:28.972 --> 00:05:32.350
If you are bored of brawling with thieves
and want to achieve something...

53
00:05:32.517 --> 00:05:36.021
...there is a rare blue flower
that grows on the eastern slopes.

54
00:05:36.187 --> 00:05:37.856
Pick one of these flowers.

55
00:05:38.023 --> 00:05:40.984
If you can carry it
to the top of the mountain...

56
00:05:41.151 --> 00:05:44.070
...you may find what you were
looking for in the first place.

57
00:05:44.237 --> 00:05:46.990
And what was I looking for?

58
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.660
Only you can know that.

59
00:06:57.811 --> 00:07:01.439
You turn back. You go back.

60
00:08:09.049 --> 00:08:11.051
Ra's al Ghul?

61
00:08:21.269 --> 00:08:22.854
Wait.

62
00:08:25.857 --> 00:08:27.150
What are you seeking?

63
00:08:28.068 --> 00:08:30.070
I seek...

64
00:08:31.613 --> 00:08:33.865
...the means to fight injustice.

65
00:08:34.241 --> 00:08:36.368
To turn fear...

66
00:08:36.701 --> 00:08:39.537
...against those
who prey on the fearful.

67
00:09:01.226 --> 00:09:04.312
To manipulate the fears in others...

68
00:09:05.146 --> 00:09:08.567
...you must first master your own.

69
00:09:09.109 --> 00:09:10.902
Are you ready to begin?

70
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.406
I can... I can barely stand.

71
00:09:14.573 --> 00:09:16.908
Death does not wait
for you to be ready!

72
00:09:17.075 --> 00:09:20.245
Death is not considerate or fair!

73
00:09:20.745 --> 00:09:25.375
And make no mistake,
here you face death.

74
00:09:29.254 --> 00:09:30.589
Tiger.

75
00:09:32.215 --> 00:09:34.009
Jujitsu.

76
00:09:36.219 --> 00:09:37.262
Panther.

77
00:09:40.765 --> 00:09:43.101
You're skilled. But this is not a dance.

78
00:09:48.565 --> 00:09:50.108
And you are afraid.

79
00:09:53.069 --> 00:09:54.946
But not of me.

80
00:09:58.408 --> 00:10:00.911
Tell us, Mr. Wayne...

81
00:10:05.415 --> 00:10:08.585
...what do you fear?

82
00:10:17.719 --> 00:10:19.137
Bruce?

83
00:10:21.806 --> 00:10:24.309
It's okay. It's okay.

84
00:10:24.476 --> 00:10:25.977
You'll be okay.

85
00:10:26.228 --> 00:10:28.521
Will we be needing an ambulance,
Master Wayne?

86
00:10:28.688 --> 00:10:31.691
No, I'll set the bone
and take him for an x-ray later.

87
00:10:31.858 --> 00:10:33.109
Very good, sir.

88
00:10:33.568 --> 00:10:37.280
- I'm very sorry, sir. I've told...
- Don't worry. It's fine.

89
00:10:39.574 --> 00:10:41.534
Took quite a fall, didn't we,
Master Bruce?

90
00:10:41.701 --> 00:10:42.994
And why do we fall, Bruce?

91
00:10:43.328 --> 00:10:46.414
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

92
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:53.046
Just a little fall.
It's just a small fracture.

93
00:11:02.013 --> 00:11:03.848
The bats again?

94
00:11:07.018 --> 00:11:09.145
You know why they attacked you,
don't you?

95
00:11:09.646 --> 00:11:12.691
- They were afraid of you.
- Afraid of me?

96
00:11:12.857 --> 00:11:14.859
All creatures feel fear.

97
00:11:15.026 --> 00:11:16.361
Even the scary ones?

98
00:11:16.528 --> 00:11:18.405
Especially the scary ones.

99
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.574
I got something to show you.

100
00:11:24.869 --> 00:11:28.206
- You think your mother will like them?
- Yeah.

101
00:11:28.873 --> 00:11:31.042
- I think it's time to get up.
- Maybe.

102
00:11:31.209 --> 00:11:32.836
No going back to bed.

103
00:11:36.047 --> 00:11:38.174
Did you build this train, Dad?

104
00:11:38.341 --> 00:11:43.054
Gotham's been good to our family,
but the city's been suffering.

105
00:11:43.221 --> 00:11:46.725
People less fortunate than us
have been enduring very hard times.

106
00:11:46.892 --> 00:11:50.854
So we built a new, cheap, public
transportation system to unite the city.

107
00:11:51.021 --> 00:11:52.731
And at the center...

108
00:11:52.898 --> 00:11:54.733
...Wayne Tower.

109
00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.777
- Is that where you work?
- No, I work at the hospital.

110
00:11:57.944 --> 00:12:01.156
I leave the running of our company
to much better men.

111
00:12:01.323 --> 00:12:03.199
- Better?
- Well...

112
00:12:03.366 --> 00:12:05.619
...more interested men.

113
00:13:02.008 --> 00:13:03.426
Can we go?

114
00:13:05.804 --> 00:13:07.305
Please.

115
00:13:07.889 --> 00:13:09.933
Okay. Let's go.

116
00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.028
- What's wrong, Bruce?
- No, no. It was me.

117
00:13:22.195 --> 00:13:24.322
I just needed some fresh air.

118
00:13:24.489 --> 00:13:27.659
A little bit of opera goes a long way.
Right, Bruce?

119
00:13:30.287 --> 00:13:32.998
Come on. Let's go.

120
00:13:38.461 --> 00:13:40.213
Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast.

121
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.756
- That's fine.
- Fast.

122
00:13:41.923 --> 00:13:43.508
Take it easy.

123
00:13:44.175 --> 00:13:45.719
Take it easy.

124
00:13:46.511 --> 00:13:47.971
Here you go.

125
00:13:50.724 --> 00:13:53.560
It's fine. It's fine.

126
00:13:54.436 --> 00:13:57.564
Now just take it and go.

127
00:13:57.731 --> 00:13:59.524
- I said, jewelry.
- Hey...

128
00:14:01.568 --> 00:14:02.903
Thomas!

129
00:14:10.911 --> 00:14:12.537
Bruce.

130
00:14:15.165 --> 00:14:16.541
It's okay.

131
00:14:19.711 --> 00:14:21.421
Don't be afraid.

132
00:14:53.245 --> 00:14:55.038
Is this your father's?

133
00:14:56.581 --> 00:14:58.708
It's okay.

134
00:14:59.918 --> 00:15:01.544
Come here.

135
00:15:04.256 --> 00:15:06.466
There you go.

136
00:15:09.594 --> 00:15:11.596
It's okay.

137
00:15:13.348 --> 00:15:15.267
It's okay.

138
00:15:19.271 --> 00:15:20.772
Gordon.

139
00:15:28.863 --> 00:15:30.448
Hey.

140
00:15:31.074 --> 00:15:32.284
Good news.

141
00:15:33.743 --> 00:15:35.620
We got him, son.

142
00:15:56.266 --> 00:15:58.143
You're in excellent hands.

143
00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:59.978
We'll be watching the empire.

144
00:16:00.145 --> 00:16:03.148
When you grow up,
it'll be waiting for you.

145
00:16:19.164 --> 00:16:22.292
I thought I might prepare
a little supper.

146
00:16:27.464 --> 00:16:29.549
- Very well.
- Alfred?

147
00:16:33.511 --> 00:16:35.513
- Yes, Master Bruce?
- It was my fault, Alfred.

148
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.349
- I made them leave the theater.
- No.

149
00:16:37.515 --> 00:16:40.560
- lf I hadn't gotten scared...
- It was nothing that you did.

150
00:16:41.686 --> 00:16:45.023
It was him, and him alone.

151
00:16:45.523 --> 00:16:47.025
Do you understand?

152
00:16:50.153 --> 00:16:53.198
I miss them, Alfred.
I miss them so much.

153
00:16:53.365 --> 00:16:55.367
So do I, Master Bruce.

154
00:16:57.786 --> 00:16:59.037
So do I.

155
00:17:01.164 --> 00:17:04.125
And do you still feel responsible
for your parents' death?

156
00:17:04.292 --> 00:17:06.419
My anger outweighs my guilt.

157
00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:08.546
Come.

158
00:17:13.218 --> 00:17:15.929
You have learned to bury
your guilt with anger.

159
00:17:16.096 --> 00:17:19.140
I will teach you to confront it
and to face the truth.

160
00:17:21.643 --> 00:17:26.606
You know how to fight six men.
We can teach you how to engage 600.

161
00:17:27.857 --> 00:17:29.734
You know how to disappear.

162
00:17:29.901 --> 00:17:32.112
We can teach you
to become truly invisible.

163
00:17:33.738 --> 00:17:35.448
Invisible?

164
00:17:39.452 --> 00:17:44.082
The ninja understands that invisibility
is a matter of patience and agility.

165
00:17:57.053 --> 00:17:58.763
Always mind your surroundings.

166
00:18:01.933 --> 00:18:04.144
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.

167
00:18:05.645 --> 00:18:07.898
- As weapons?
- Or distractions.

168
00:18:08.064 --> 00:18:10.400
Theatricality and deception
are powerful agents.

169
00:18:10.859 --> 00:18:13.904
You must become more than just a man
in the mind of your opponent.

170
00:18:16.197 --> 00:18:18.325
- Who is he?
- He was a farmer.

171
00:18:18.491 --> 00:18:21.745
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land
and became a murderer.

172
00:18:21.912 --> 00:18:24.205
- Now he is a prisoner.
- What'll happen to him?

173
00:18:24.372 --> 00:18:26.791
Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.

174
00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:30.921
Criminals thrive on the indulgence
of society's understanding.

175
00:18:34.966 --> 00:18:37.802
Your parents' death
was not your fault.

176
00:18:46.144 --> 00:18:47.395
It was your father's.

177
00:19:08.291 --> 00:19:11.127
Anger does not change the fact
that your father failed to act.

178
00:19:11.294 --> 00:19:13.505
- The man had a gun.
- Would that stop you?

179
00:19:14.297 --> 00:19:15.507
I've had training.

180
00:19:15.674 --> 00:19:17.509
The training is nothing!

181
00:19:17.676 --> 00:19:19.344
Will is everything!

182
00:19:25.141 --> 00:19:26.977
The will to act.

183
00:19:36.736 --> 00:19:37.988
Yield.

184
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.698
You haven't beaten me.

185
00:19:39.864 --> 00:19:42.576
You have sacrificed sure footing
for a killing stroke.

186
00:19:50.208 --> 00:19:52.002
Rub your chest.

187
00:19:52.502 --> 00:19:55.380
Your arms will
take care of themselves.

188
00:19:58.049 --> 00:19:59.676
You are stronger than your father.

189
00:20:00.343 --> 00:20:01.970
You didn't know my father.

190
00:20:02.137 --> 00:20:04.431
But I know the rage that drives you.

191
00:20:04.598 --> 00:20:06.892
That impossible anger
strangling the grief...

192
00:20:07.058 --> 00:20:09.728
...until the memory
of your loved one is just...

193
00:20:09.895 --> 00:20:11.897
...poison in your veins.

194
00:20:12.063 --> 00:20:16.526
And one day, you catch yourself wishing
the person you loved had never existed...

195
00:20:17.944 --> 00:20:20.405
...so you'd be spared your pain.

196
00:20:23.408 --> 00:20:26.786
I wasn't always here in the mountains.

197
00:20:28.413 --> 00:20:30.457
Once, I had a wife.

198
00:20:31.416 --> 00:20:33.335
My great love.

199
00:20:34.502 --> 00:20:36.630
She was taken from me.

200
00:20:36.796 --> 00:20:40.008
Like you, I was forced to learn
there are those without decency...

201
00:20:40.175 --> 00:20:43.470
...who must be fought
without hesitation, without pity.

202
00:20:45.263 --> 00:20:47.599
Your anger gives you great power.

203
00:20:48.099 --> 00:20:51.645
But if you let it, it will destroy you...

204
00:20:52.187 --> 00:20:54.105
...as it almost did me.

205
00:20:54.272 --> 00:20:56.983
- What stopped it?
- Vengeance.

206
00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.110
That's no help to me.

207
00:20:59.277 --> 00:21:01.112
Why, Bruce?

208
00:21:01.279 --> 00:21:03.949
Why could you not
avenge your parents?

209
00:21:07.786 --> 00:21:11.248
Will you be heading back to Princeton
after the hearing, sir...

210
00:21:11.414 --> 00:21:14.084
...or can I persuade you to stay on
for a day or two?

211
00:21:14.251 --> 00:21:16.461
I'm not heading back at all.

212
00:21:16.628 --> 00:21:18.672
- You don't like it there?
- I like it fine.

213
00:21:19.089 --> 00:21:21.883
They just don't feel the same way.

214
00:21:22.676 --> 00:21:26.346
- I've prepared the master bedroom.
- No.

215
00:21:26.513 --> 00:21:27.931
My room will be fine.

216
00:21:28.098 --> 00:21:30.642
With all due respect, sir,
Wayne Manor is your house.

217
00:21:30.809 --> 00:21:32.644
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

218
00:21:32.811 --> 00:21:35.188
- Your father is dead.
- This place is a mausoleum.

219
00:21:35.355 --> 00:21:38.400
If I have my way, I'll pull
the damn thing down brick by brick.

220
00:21:38.567 --> 00:21:42.654
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered
six generations of your family.

221
00:21:42.821 --> 00:21:45.532
Why do you give a damn, Alfred?
It's not your family.

222
00:21:46.366 --> 00:21:50.245
I give a damn because a good man
once made me responsible...

223
00:21:50.912 --> 00:21:53.081
...for what was
most precious to him...

224
00:21:53.248 --> 00:21:55.500
...in the whole world.

225
00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:01.006
Miss Dawes has offered
to drive you to the hearing.

226
00:22:01.172 --> 00:22:03.216
She probably hopes
to talk you out of going.

227
00:22:03.383 --> 00:22:06.845
Should I just bury the past out there
with my parents, Alfred?

228
00:22:07.012 --> 00:22:10.098
I wouldn't presume to tell you
what to do with your past, sir.

229
00:22:10.265 --> 00:22:14.311
Just know that there are those of us who
care about what you do with your future.

230
00:22:15.687 --> 00:22:17.188
Haven't given up on me yet?

231
00:22:17.856 --> 00:22:19.357
Never.

232
00:23:07.906 --> 00:23:11.326
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk
on the top shelf.

233
00:23:12.202 --> 00:23:14.120
Hasn't he noticed
you're tall enough to reach now?

234
00:23:14.287 --> 00:23:15.580
Old habits die hard, I guess.

235
00:23:15.956 --> 00:23:18.541
- Never used to stop us anyway.
- No, it didn't.

236
00:23:18.708 --> 00:23:20.585
How's your mom?

237
00:23:21.002 --> 00:23:23.255
She misses this place.

238
00:23:24.756 --> 00:23:26.258
So do I.

239
00:23:26.675 --> 00:23:27.926
Yeah.

240
00:23:28.093 --> 00:23:31.096
But it's nothing without the people
who made it what it was.

241
00:23:31.263 --> 00:23:34.266
- Now there's only Alfred.
- And you.

242
00:23:34.432 --> 00:23:37.978
- I'm not staying, Rachel.
- You're just back for the hearing.

243
00:23:41.606 --> 00:23:45.777
Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way
to convince you not to come.

244
00:23:46.111 --> 00:23:49.614
Someone at this proceeding...

245
00:23:50.282 --> 00:23:52.450
...should stand for my parents.

246
00:23:52.617 --> 00:23:54.744
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

247
00:23:54.911 --> 00:23:58.123
- What Chill did is unforgivable.
- Then why is your boss letting him go?

248
00:23:59.499 --> 00:24:02.752
In prison, he shared a cell
with Carmine Falcone.

249
00:24:02.919 --> 00:24:06.590
He learned things, and he will testify
in exchange for early parole.

250
00:24:06.756 --> 00:24:09.426
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

251
00:24:11.428 --> 00:24:13.138
I cannot let that pass.

252
00:24:13.305 --> 00:24:16.182
And I need you
to understand that, please.

253
00:24:17.934 --> 00:24:19.144
Okay.

254
00:24:20.228 --> 00:24:23.565
The depression hit working people,
like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.

255
00:24:23.732 --> 00:24:26.943
His crime was appalling, yes,
but it was motivated not by greed...

256
00:24:27.277 --> 00:24:28.945
...but by desperation.

257
00:24:29.112 --> 00:24:33.033
Given the 14 years served, as well as
his extraordinary level of cooperation...

258
00:24:33.199 --> 00:24:35.827
...with one of this office's
most important investigations...

259
00:24:35.994 --> 00:24:39.122
...we strongly endorse his petition
for early release.

260
00:24:40.123 --> 00:24:42.417
Mr. Chill?

261
00:24:46.004 --> 00:24:47.672
Your Honor...

262
00:24:48.548 --> 00:24:51.676
...not a day goes by that I don't wish
I could take back what I did.

263
00:24:54.304 --> 00:24:57.557
Sure, I was desperate,
like a lot of people back then...

264
00:24:57.724 --> 00:25:00.060
...but that don't change what I did.

265
00:25:03.688 --> 00:25:08.360
I gather there is a member
of the Wayne family here today.

266
00:25:08.526 --> 00:25:10.820
Has he got anything to say?

267
00:25:25.543 --> 00:25:28.380
- He's coming out the side!
- He's coming out the side, guys!

268
00:25:38.056 --> 00:25:39.349
Bruce Wayne!

269
00:25:42.185 --> 00:25:43.395
Joe! Hey, Joe!

270
00:25:43.562 --> 00:25:45.063
Falcone says hi.

271
00:25:55.407 --> 00:25:58.994
Come on, Bruce.
We don't need to see this.

272
00:25:59.744 --> 00:26:01.288
I do.

273
00:26:06.418 --> 00:26:08.420
The DA couldn't understand
why Judge Faden...

274
00:26:08.587 --> 00:26:10.422
...insisted on making the hearing public.

275
00:26:10.589 --> 00:26:13.008
Falcone paid him off
to get Chill out in the open.

276
00:26:13.216 --> 00:26:14.467
Maybe I should thank them.

277
00:26:14.634 --> 00:26:17.220
- You don't mean that.
- What if I do, Rachel?

278
00:26:17.387 --> 00:26:19.306
My parents deserved justice.

279
00:26:19.472 --> 00:26:22.392
You're not talking about justice.
You're talking about revenge.

280
00:26:22.559 --> 00:26:25.437
- Sometimes, they're the same.
- No, they're never the same.

281
00:26:25.604 --> 00:26:29.190
Justice is about harmony. Revenge is
about you making yourself feel better.

282
00:26:29.357 --> 00:26:32.652
- It's why we have an impartial system.
- Your system is broken.

283
00:26:39.743 --> 00:26:42.579
You care about justice?
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

284
00:26:42.996 --> 00:26:44.456
This city is rotting.

285
00:26:44.623 --> 00:26:47.417
They talk about the depression
as if it's history. It's not.

286
00:26:47.584 --> 00:26:49.085
Things are worse than ever here.

287
00:26:49.252 --> 00:26:51.796
Falcone floods our streets
with crime and drugs...

288
00:26:51.963 --> 00:26:54.925
...preying on the desperate,
creating new Joe Chills every day.

289
00:26:55.091 --> 00:26:57.636
Falcone may not have killed
your parents, Bruce...

290
00:26:58.261 --> 00:27:00.764
...but he's destroying everything
that they stood for.

291
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.188
You wanna thank him for that?
Here you go.

292
00:27:10.065 --> 00:27:13.109
We all know where to find him.
As long as he keeps the bad people rich...

293
00:27:13.276 --> 00:27:15.362
...and the good people scared,
no one'll touch him.

294
00:27:15.528 --> 00:27:19.824
Good people like your parents, who'll
stand against injustice, they're gone.

295
00:27:19.991 --> 00:27:23.703
What chance does Gotham have
when the good people do nothing?

296
00:27:24.579 --> 00:27:27.999
- I'm not one of your good people, Rachel.
- What do you mean?

297
00:27:30.252 --> 00:27:33.296
All these years, I wanted to kill him.

298
00:27:34.089 --> 00:27:35.674
Now I can't.

299
00:27:51.565 --> 00:27:53.275
Your father would be ashamed of you.

300
00:28:36.735 --> 00:28:39.237
You're taller than you look
in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

301
00:28:39.696 --> 00:28:41.573
No gun? I'm insulted.

302
00:28:44.743 --> 00:28:48.538
- You could've just sent a thank-you note.
- I didn't come here to thank you.

303
00:28:48.705 --> 00:28:51.458
I came to show you that
not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.

304
00:28:51.625 --> 00:28:53.251
Only those who know me, kid.

305
00:28:53.585 --> 00:28:56.087
Look around you.
You'll see two councilmen...

306
00:28:56.421 --> 00:28:59.257
...a union official,
couple off-duty cops...

307
00:28:59.674 --> 00:29:01.301
...and a judge.

308
00:29:01.468 --> 00:29:05.764
I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of
blowing your head off in front of them.

309
00:29:05.931 --> 00:29:08.642
Now, that's power you can't buy.

310
00:29:09.267 --> 00:29:10.727
That's the power of fear.

311
00:29:11.144 --> 00:29:12.395
I'm not afraid of you.

312
00:29:12.562 --> 00:29:14.481
Because you think you got
nothing to lose.

313
00:29:14.648 --> 00:29:16.316
But you haven't thought it through.

314
00:29:16.483 --> 00:29:19.569
You haven't thought about
your lady friend in the DA's office.

315
00:29:19.736 --> 00:29:22.155
You haven't thought about
your old butler.

316
00:29:26.284 --> 00:29:28.620
People from your world...

317
00:29:28.787 --> 00:29:31.164
...have so much to lose.

318
00:29:31.331 --> 00:29:35.669
Now, you think because your mommy
and your daddy got shot...

319
00:29:35.835 --> 00:29:38.797
...you know about the ugly side of life,
but you don't.

320
00:29:38.964 --> 00:29:41.091
You've never tasted desperate.

321
00:29:41.258 --> 00:29:43.802
You're... You're Bruce Wayne,
the prince of Gotham.

322
00:29:43.969 --> 00:29:47.389
You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet
someone who didn't know your name.

323
00:29:47.556 --> 00:29:51.851
So don't come here with your anger,
trying to prove something to yourself.

324
00:29:52.018 --> 00:29:54.145
This is a world
you'll never understand.

325
00:29:54.312 --> 00:29:56.314
And you always fear...

326
00:29:56.481 --> 00:29:58.942
...what you don't understand.

327
00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:03.196
All right.

328
00:30:10.829 --> 00:30:13.665
Yeah, you got spirit, kid.
I'll give you that.

329
00:30:13.832 --> 00:30:15.834
More than your old man anyway.

330
00:30:16.001 --> 00:30:20.297
In the joint, Chill told me about
the night he killed your parents.

331
00:30:20.463 --> 00:30:22.674
He said your father begged for mercy.

332
00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:25.802
Begged.

333
00:30:25.969 --> 00:30:27.345
Like a dog.

334
00:30:40.191 --> 00:30:41.985
Should've tipped better.

335
00:30:51.995 --> 00:30:53.830
- For what?
- Your jacket.

336
00:30:54.372 --> 00:30:55.999
Okay.

337
00:30:57.083 --> 00:31:00.545
Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it.
It's a nice coat.

338
00:31:00.712 --> 00:31:02.839
Be careful who sees you with that.

339
00:31:03.423 --> 00:31:05.342
- They're gonna come looking for me.
- Who?

340
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.510
Everyone.

341
00:31:09.804 --> 00:31:11.556
It's...

342
00:31:11.723 --> 00:31:13.725
It's a nice coat.

343
00:31:32.035 --> 00:31:36.414
When you lived among the criminals,
did you start to pity them?

344
00:31:36.581 --> 00:31:40.252
The first time I stole
so that I wouldn 't starve, yes.

345
00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:45.924
I lost many assumptions about
the simple nature of right and wrong.

346
00:31:47.217 --> 00:31:49.302
And when I traveled...

347
00:31:49.469 --> 00:31:52.180
...I learned the fear before a crime...

348
00:31:52.931 --> 00:31:55.517
...and the thrill of success.

349
00:31:57.394 --> 00:31:59.271
But I never became one of them.

350
00:32:02.732 --> 00:32:05.652
Fool. What do I care what your name is?
You're a criminal.

351
00:32:07.112 --> 00:32:08.905
Tell that to the guy who owned these.

352
00:32:12.117 --> 00:32:16.079
You've traveled the world to understand
the criminal mind and conquer your fears.

353
00:32:18.164 --> 00:32:22.294
But a criminal is not complicated.

354
00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:25.797
And what you really fear
is inside yourself.

355
00:32:25.964 --> 00:32:28.508
You fear your own power.

356
00:32:28.675 --> 00:32:29.968
You fear your anger...

357
00:32:30.427 --> 00:32:34.681
...the drive to do great
or terrible things.

358
00:32:34.848 --> 00:32:38.310
Now you must journey inwards.

359
00:32:42.063 --> 00:32:44.149
You are ready.

360
00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:46.568
Breathe.

361
00:32:56.119 --> 00:32:57.996
Breathe.

362
00:33:03.001 --> 00:33:04.836
Breathe in your fears.

363
00:33:07.464 --> 00:33:08.506
Face them.

364
00:33:10.008 --> 00:33:12.802
To conquer fear,
you must become fear.

365
00:33:12.969 --> 00:33:16.348
You must bask in the fear
of other men.

366
00:33:17.807 --> 00:33:21.228
And men fear most
what they cannot see.

367
00:33:38.453 --> 00:33:41.331
You have to become a terrible thought.

368
00:33:45.877 --> 00:33:47.087
A wraith.

369
00:33:52.801 --> 00:33:55.178
You have to become an idea!

370
00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:05.105
Feel terror cloud your senses.

371
00:34:06.856 --> 00:34:10.068
Feel its power to distort.

372
00:34:11.027 --> 00:34:13.238
To control.

373
00:34:16.324 --> 00:34:20.120
And know that this power
can be yours.

374
00:34:32.674 --> 00:34:35.343
Embrace your worst fear.

375
00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:44.644
Become one with the darkness.

376
00:35:04.456 --> 00:35:06.166
Focus.

377
00:35:06.458 --> 00:35:08.627
Concentrate.

378
00:35:08.793 --> 00:35:10.921
Master your senses.

379
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:41.451
You cannot leave any sign.

380
00:35:41.826 --> 00:35:43.036
I haven't.

381
00:35:51.336 --> 00:35:53.338
Impressive.

382
00:36:02.806 --> 00:36:04.516
We have purged your fear.

383
00:36:05.684 --> 00:36:07.310
You are ready to lead these men.

384
00:36:07.477 --> 00:36:11.022
You are ready to become a member
of the League of Shadows.

385
00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:17.821
But first, you must demonstrate
your commitment to justice.

386
00:36:34.546 --> 00:36:35.922
No.

387
00:36:37.382 --> 00:36:38.675
I'm no executioner.

388
00:36:39.217 --> 00:36:42.888
Your compassion is a weakness
your enemies will not share.

389
00:36:43.263 --> 00:36:45.557
That's why it's so important.

390
00:36:45.807 --> 00:36:47.559
It separates us from them.

391
00:36:47.726 --> 00:36:50.103
You want to fight criminals.
This man is a murderer.

392
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:52.063
- This man should be tried.
- By whom?

393
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:53.940
Corrupt bureaucrats?

394
00:36:54.107 --> 00:36:56.610
Criminals mock society's laws.

395
00:36:56.776 --> 00:36:59.070
You know this better than most.

396
00:36:59.946 --> 00:37:02.574
You cannot lead these men...

397
00:37:02.741 --> 00:37:06.745
...unless you are prepared to do
what is necessary to defeat evil.

398
00:37:07.329 --> 00:37:09.748
And where would I be leading
these men?

399
00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:11.583
Gotham.

400
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:13.793
As Gotham's favored son...

401
00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:18.298
...you will be ideally placed
to strike at the heart of criminality.

402
00:37:18.673 --> 00:37:22.427
- How?
- Gotham's time has come.

403
00:37:22.594 --> 00:37:25.931
Like Constantinople
or Rome before it...

404
00:37:26.097 --> 00:37:30.310
...the city has become a breeding ground
for suffering and injustice.

405
00:37:30.477 --> 00:37:34.105
It is beyond saving
and must be allowed to die.

406
00:37:34.272 --> 00:37:39.444
This is the most important function
of the League of Shadows.

407
00:37:39.736 --> 00:37:42.822
It is one we've performed
for centuries.

408
00:37:43.156 --> 00:37:44.908
Gotham...

409
00:37:45.075 --> 00:37:47.953
...must be destroyed.

410
00:37:51.289 --> 00:37:52.791
You can't believe in this.

411
00:37:52.999 --> 00:37:57.546
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from
the darkest corners of our own hearts.

412
00:37:57.712 --> 00:38:02.133
What he asks in return is the courage
to do what is necessary.

413
00:38:02.342 --> 00:38:05.679
I will go back to Gotham
and I will fight men like this...

414
00:38:05.845 --> 00:38:08.431
...but I will not
become an executioner.

415
00:38:08.598 --> 00:38:10.141
Bruce, please.

416
00:38:10.308 --> 00:38:13.144
For your own sake,
there is no turning back.

417
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:48.054
- What are you doing?
- What's necessary, my friend.

418
00:41:04.482 --> 00:41:07.611
I will tell him you saved his life.

419
00:41:26.338 --> 00:41:28.882
Master Wayne,
you've been gone a long time.

420
00:41:29.049 --> 00:41:31.343
- Yes, I have.
- You look very fashionable.

421
00:41:32.844 --> 00:41:34.346
Apart from the mud.

422
00:41:34.596 --> 00:41:37.265
Are you coming back to Gotham
for long, sir?

423
00:41:37.432 --> 00:41:38.683
As long as it takes.

424
00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:40.352
I want to show the people...

425
00:41:40.518 --> 00:41:43.939
...their city doesn't belong
to the criminals and the corrupt.

426
00:41:44.105 --> 00:41:47.317
In the depression, your father nearly
bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...

427
00:41:47.484 --> 00:41:48.693
...combating poverty.

428
00:41:48.902 --> 00:41:53.406
He believed his example could inspire
the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.

429
00:41:53.698 --> 00:41:55.325
Did it?

430
00:41:56.451 --> 00:41:57.911
In a way.

431
00:41:58.078 --> 00:42:01.164
Their murder shocked the wealthy
and the powerful into action.

432
00:42:03.166 --> 00:42:06.211
People need dramatic examples
to shake them out of apathy.

433
00:42:06.378 --> 00:42:08.046
I can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

434
00:42:08.213 --> 00:42:09.756
As a man...

435
00:42:09.923 --> 00:42:12.342
...I'm flesh and blood,
I can be ignored, destroyed.

436
00:42:12.509 --> 00:42:14.427
But as a symbol...

437
00:42:15.887 --> 00:42:18.557
As a symbol, I can be incorruptible.

438
00:42:18.723 --> 00:42:21.351
- I can be everlasting.
- What symbol?

439
00:42:21.935 --> 00:42:24.604
Something elemental...

440
00:42:24.771 --> 00:42:26.398
...something terrifying.

441
00:42:26.565 --> 00:42:28.692
I assume that as you take on
the underworld...

442
00:42:28.858 --> 00:42:33.989
...this symbol is a persona to protect
those you care about from reprisals?

443
00:42:34.155 --> 00:42:35.532
You're thinking about Rachel?

444
00:42:35.699 --> 00:42:38.076
Actually, sir, I was thinking of myself.

445
00:42:40.078 --> 00:42:41.830
Have you told anyone
I'm coming back?

446
00:42:42.038 --> 00:42:46.251
I couldn't figure the legal ramifications
of bringing you back from the dead.

447
00:42:46.418 --> 00:42:48.295
- Dead?
- You've been gone seven years.

448
00:42:48.461 --> 00:42:49.754
You had me declared dead?

449
00:42:49.921 --> 00:42:52.799
Actually, it was Mr. Earle.
He's taking the company public.

450
00:42:52.966 --> 00:42:55.218
He wanted to liquidate
your majority shareholding.

451
00:42:55.427 --> 00:42:57.762
Those shares are worth
quite a bit of money.

452
00:42:57.929 --> 00:43:00.640
Well, it's a good thing
I left everything to you, then.

453
00:43:01.182 --> 00:43:02.809
Quite so, sir.

454
00:43:02.976 --> 00:43:06.730
And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like.
Just bring it back with a full tank.

455
00:43:16.698 --> 00:43:21.411
In my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much
a danger to himself as to others...

456
00:43:21.787 --> 00:43:26.375
...and prison is probably not the best
environment for his rehabilitation.

457
00:43:28.669 --> 00:43:31.254
- Dr. Crane.
- Miss Dawes.

458
00:43:31.421 --> 00:43:34.716
You think a man who butchers people
for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

459
00:43:34.883 --> 00:43:37.552
I would hardly have testified to that
otherwise, would I?

460
00:43:37.719 --> 00:43:40.806
This is the third of Falcone's thugs
you've had declared insane...

461
00:43:40.973 --> 00:43:42.391
...and moved into your asylum.

462
00:43:42.599 --> 00:43:47.229
The work offered by organized crime
must have an attraction to the insane.

463
00:43:48.772 --> 00:43:50.774
Or the corrupt.

464
00:43:53.026 --> 00:43:54.611
Mr. Finch.

465
00:43:54.945 --> 00:43:56.738
You should check
with Miss Dawes here...

466
00:43:56.905 --> 00:44:01.285
...just what implications your office
has authorized her to make. If any.

467
00:44:05.247 --> 00:44:07.582
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing, Carl?

468
00:44:07.749 --> 00:44:09.126
Looking out for you.

469
00:44:11.628 --> 00:44:14.548
Falcone has half the city
bought and paid for.

470
00:44:14.715 --> 00:44:16.758
- Drop it.
- How can you say that?

471
00:44:16.925 --> 00:44:20.637
Because as much as I care about
getting Falcone, I care more about you.

472
00:44:20.804 --> 00:44:22.097
That's sweet.

473
00:44:27.519 --> 00:44:29.896
We've been through all that.

474
00:44:55.964 --> 00:44:57.424
Blessed bat again, sir.

475
00:44:57.883 --> 00:45:00.302
They nest somewhere in the grounds.

476
00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:00.881
No more favors.
Someone is sniffing around.

477
00:47:01.048 --> 00:47:04.009
Hey, I scratch your back,
you scratch mine, doc.

478
00:47:04.176 --> 00:47:05.552
I'm bringing in the shipments.

479
00:47:06.261 --> 00:47:07.471
We are paying you for that.

480
00:47:07.638 --> 00:47:10.140
Maybe money isn't as interesting
to me as favors.

481
00:47:12.643 --> 00:47:17.439
I am more than aware that you are
not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

482
00:47:17.606 --> 00:47:20.692
But you know who I'm working for,
and when he gets here...

483
00:47:20.859 --> 00:47:22.778
He... He's coming to Gotham?

484
00:47:22.944 --> 00:47:24.404
Yes, he is.

485
00:47:24.571 --> 00:47:27.032
And when he gets here,
he's not going to wanna hear...

486
00:47:27.199 --> 00:47:32.287
...that you've endangered our operation
just to get your thugs out of jail time.

487
00:47:33.288 --> 00:47:36.625
- Who's bothering you?
- There's a girl at the DA's office.

488
00:47:37.125 --> 00:47:38.919
- We'll buy her off.
- Not this one.

489
00:47:40.045 --> 00:47:41.964
Idealist, huh?

490
00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:43.840
Well, there's an answer to that too.

491
00:47:44.216 --> 00:47:47.177
- I don't want to know.
- Yes, you do.

492
00:47:51.348 --> 00:47:54.810
No, we are showing very healthy growth
in these sectors.

493
00:47:54.977 --> 00:47:58.146
I don't think Thomas Wayne would have
viewed heavy-arms manufacture...

494
00:47:58.313 --> 00:48:00.482
...as a suitable cornerstone
for our business.

495
00:48:01.858 --> 00:48:05.654
Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.

496
00:48:05.988 --> 00:48:09.157
I think after 20 years
we can allow ourselves...

497
00:48:09.324 --> 00:48:12.160
...to stop thinking about what
Thomas Wayne would have done.

498
00:48:12.327 --> 00:48:14.204
Good morning, Mr. Earle's office.

499
00:48:14.371 --> 00:48:17.666
Yes, he's confirmed for
the dinner tomorrow evening.

500
00:48:17.833 --> 00:48:21.169
Good morning.
I'm here to see Mr. Earle.

501
00:48:21.336 --> 00:48:22.838
Name?

502
00:48:23.297 --> 00:48:24.965
Bruce Wayne.

503
00:48:26.842 --> 00:48:30.345
Thomas would probably not
have taken the company public.

504
00:48:30.512 --> 00:48:34.599
But that is what we,
as responsible managers, are going to do.

505
00:48:35.309 --> 00:48:36.852
Jessica?

506
00:48:37.936 --> 00:48:40.480
Jessica? Where are you?

507
00:48:40.647 --> 00:48:44.901
- Eye on the ball, and...
- Why is no one answering the phone?

508
00:48:45.569 --> 00:48:48.739
It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle.
I'm sure they'll call back.

509
00:48:49.072 --> 00:48:51.575
Bruce? You're supposed to be dead.

510
00:48:51.742 --> 00:48:53.702
I'm sorry to disappoint.

511
00:48:53.869 --> 00:48:56.580
- I need you to take a look at this.
- Have you seen him yet?

512
00:48:56.872 --> 00:48:58.415
- Who?
- Wayne.

513
00:48:58.749 --> 00:49:00.834
It's been all over the news.
He's back.

514
00:49:04.755 --> 00:49:07.674
I'm sure you realize
I can't stop the big machine.

515
00:49:07.841 --> 00:49:09.092
Too many wheels turning.

516
00:49:09.259 --> 00:49:11.261
- We're going public.
- I understand.

517
00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:14.556
And I'll be handsomely rewarded
for my shares.

518
00:49:14.723 --> 00:49:17.267
I'm not looking to interfere.

519
00:49:17.726 --> 00:49:19.853
- I am looking for a job.
- Oh?

520
00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:23.065
I just want to get to know the company
that my family built.

521
00:49:23.398 --> 00:49:25.150
Any ideas where you would start?

522
00:49:25.651 --> 00:49:28.028
Applied Sciences caught my eye.

523
00:49:28.403 --> 00:49:30.113
Fox's department.

524
00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.282
I'll let him know you're coming.

525
00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.953
You look like him. Your dad.

526
00:49:36.745 --> 00:49:39.414
You're the only one left
of the Wayne family.

527
00:49:39.581 --> 00:49:43.543
This is where you belong.
Welcome home.

528
00:49:43.877 --> 00:49:48.382
Environmental procedures,
defense projects, consumer products.

529
00:49:48.882 --> 00:49:51.593
All prototypes. None in production.

530
00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.429
- On any level whatsoever.
- None?

531
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:57.265
What did they tell you this place was?

532
00:49:57.432 --> 00:49:59.476
They didn't tell me anything.

533
00:50:01.937 --> 00:50:05.399
Earle told me exactly what it was
when he sent me down here.

534
00:50:05.857 --> 00:50:07.317
Dead end.

535
00:50:07.484 --> 00:50:10.821
Place to keep me from causing
the board any more trouble.

536
00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:13.282
Come on.

537
00:50:13.448 --> 00:50:15.909
- You were on the board?
- When your father ran things.

538
00:50:16.076 --> 00:50:17.953
- You knew my father?
- Oh, yeah.

539
00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:19.788
Helped him build his train.

540
00:50:20.372 --> 00:50:21.999
Here we are.

541
00:50:25.669 --> 00:50:27.296
Kevlar utility harness.

542
00:50:27.671 --> 00:50:29.631
Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun.

543
00:50:29.798 --> 00:50:32.134
The 350-pound test monofilament.

544
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:37.639
Wonderful project, your dad's train.

545
00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:42.769
Routed it right into Wayne Tower,
along with the water and power utilities.

546
00:50:42.936 --> 00:50:46.148
Kind of made Wayne Tower
the unofficial center of Gotham City.

547
00:50:46.356 --> 00:50:48.984
Of course, Earle let it go to rot.
Here we are.

548
00:50:50.861 --> 00:50:52.988
Nomex survival suit
for advanced infantry.

549
00:50:53.196 --> 00:50:55.949
Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.

550
00:50:56.283 --> 00:50:58.660
- Tear-resistant?
- This sucker will stop a knife.

551
00:50:58.827 --> 00:51:01.038
- Bulletproof?
- Anything but a straight shot.

552
00:51:01.204 --> 00:51:04.082
- Why didn't they put it into production?
- Bean counters didn't think...

553
00:51:04.249 --> 00:51:06.627
...a soldier's life was worth 300 grand.

554
00:51:07.711 --> 00:51:11.173
So, what's your interest in it,
Mr. Wayne?

555
00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:13.342
I want to borrow it.

556
00:51:13.508 --> 00:51:15.302
For spelunking.

557
00:51:16.178 --> 00:51:17.471
Spelunking?

558
00:51:17.638 --> 00:51:19.348
Yeah, you know, cave diving?

559
00:51:20.641 --> 00:51:23.310
You expecting to run into
much gunfire in these caves?

560
00:51:25.646 --> 00:51:28.899
Look, I'd rather Mr. Earle
didn't know about me borrowing...

561
00:51:29.066 --> 00:51:30.317
Mr. Wayne...

562
00:51:30.525 --> 00:51:32.444
...the way I see it...

563
00:51:32.903 --> 00:51:35.364
...all this stuff is yours anyway.

564
00:51:38.325 --> 00:51:40.827
Okay. Give it a try.

565
00:51:44.957 --> 00:51:46.208
Charming.

566
00:51:49.044 --> 00:51:50.837
At least you'll have company.

567
00:51:52.714 --> 00:51:56.718
This must be the lowest foundation
of the southeast wing.

568
00:52:09.189 --> 00:52:13.360
Your great-great-grandfather was
involved in the Underground Railroad...

569
00:52:13.527 --> 00:52:16.530
...secretly transporting freed slaves
to the North...

570
00:52:16.697 --> 00:52:20.409
...and I suspect these caverns
came in handy.

571
00:52:33.088 --> 00:52:35.257
Alfred! Come up here!

572
00:52:35.465 --> 00:52:38.427
I can see everything all right
from down here, sir, thank you.

573
00:52:58.447 --> 00:53:01.116
We order the main part
of this cowl from Singapore.

574
00:53:01.283 --> 00:53:02.784
Via a dummy corporation.

575
00:53:02.951 --> 00:53:04.786
Indeed. And then, quite separately...

576
00:53:04.953 --> 00:53:09.916
...we place an order
to a Chinese company for these.

577
00:53:10.459 --> 00:53:13.420
- Put it together ourselves.
- Precisely.

578
00:53:13.587 --> 00:53:17.633
They'll have to be large orders,
to avoid suspicion.

579
00:53:17.799 --> 00:53:20.344
- How large?
- Say 10,000.

580
00:53:22.846 --> 00:53:25.766
- Well, at least we'll have spares.
- Yes.

581
00:53:42.866 --> 00:53:44.952
Don't suppose you want a taste.

582
00:53:45.118 --> 00:53:48.288
I just keep offering,
thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.

583
00:53:48.455 --> 00:53:50.624
There's nothing wise
in what you do, Flass.

584
00:53:50.791 --> 00:53:54.169
Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste,
makes us guys nervous.

585
00:53:54.336 --> 00:53:56.171
I'm no rat.

586
00:53:58.924 --> 00:54:02.636
In a town this bent,
who's there to rat to anyway?

587
00:54:32.332 --> 00:54:34.459
Don't turn around.

588
00:54:35.043 --> 00:54:38.130
You're a good cop.
One of the few.

589
00:54:38.797 --> 00:54:39.923
What do you want?

590
00:54:40.090 --> 00:54:43.260
Carmine Falcone brings in
shipments of drugs every week.

591
00:54:43.427 --> 00:54:45.220
Nobody takes him down. Why?

592
00:54:46.638 --> 00:54:48.765
He's paid up with the right people.

593
00:54:49.057 --> 00:54:51.852
What will it take to bring him down?

594
00:54:52.561 --> 00:54:54.980
Leverage on Judge Faden...

595
00:54:55.689 --> 00:54:58.066
...and a DA brave enough
to prosecute.

596
00:54:58.483 --> 00:55:00.110
Rachel Dawes.

597
00:55:00.694 --> 00:55:01.820
Who are you?

598
00:55:02.237 --> 00:55:03.864
Watch for my sign.

599
00:55:06.533 --> 00:55:08.577
You're just one man?

600
00:55:08.994 --> 00:55:10.412
Now we're two.

601
00:55:12.539 --> 00:55:14.124
We?

602
00:55:29.765 --> 00:55:31.516
Freeze!

603
00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:50.619
What the hell was that?

604
00:55:53.538 --> 00:55:54.748
Just some nut.

605
00:55:58.168 --> 00:56:00.963
Well, what is it today?
More spelunking?

606
00:56:01.129 --> 00:56:03.632
No. Today it's BASE-jumping.

607
00:56:04.216 --> 00:56:05.842
BASE-jumping.

608
00:56:06.426 --> 00:56:08.971
- That like parachuting?
- Kind of.

609
00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:12.975
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

610
00:56:13.141 --> 00:56:15.811
You know,
I think I have just the thing.

611
00:56:17.145 --> 00:56:19.606
It's called memory cloth.
Notice anything?

612
00:56:22.943 --> 00:56:24.820
Regularly flexible...

613
00:56:25.237 --> 00:56:27.364
...but put a current through it...

614
00:56:28.824 --> 00:56:32.536
...molecules realign, it becomes rigid.
- What kind of shapes can you make?

615
00:56:32.703 --> 00:56:35.831
Can be tailored to fit any structure
based on a rigid skeleton.

616
00:56:35.998 --> 00:56:37.207
Too expensive for the Army?

617
00:56:37.374 --> 00:56:42.129
I don't think they tried to market it
to the billionaire, BASE-jumping crowd.

618
00:56:42.296 --> 00:56:44.089
- Look, Mr. Fox.
- Yes, sir?

619
00:56:44.756 --> 00:56:46.133
If you're uncomfortable...

620
00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:49.511
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me
exactly what you're doing...

621
00:56:49.678 --> 00:56:51.638
...when I'm asked, I don't have to lie.

622
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:55.976
But don't think of me as an idiot.

623
00:56:57.477 --> 00:56:59.438
Fair enough.

624
00:57:01.356 --> 00:57:03.191
What's that?

625
00:57:05.277 --> 00:57:07.195
The Tumbler?

626
00:57:07.696 --> 00:57:09.656
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.

627
00:57:15.662 --> 00:57:17.581
She was built as a bridging vehicle.

628
00:57:19.583 --> 00:57:24.004
During combat, two of these
would jump over a river, towing cables.

629
00:57:26.548 --> 00:57:30.177
Over here on the throttle,
flip that open and throttle up.

630
00:57:30.385 --> 00:57:32.929
This will boost you into a rampless jump...
Not now!

631
00:57:35.766 --> 00:57:37.893
Not... Not now, sir.

632
00:57:40.729 --> 00:57:42.606
Afterburner disengaged.

633
00:57:42.981 --> 00:57:46.026
We never could get
the damn bridge to work...

634
00:57:46.193 --> 00:57:47.903
...but this baby works just fine.

635
00:57:57.454 --> 00:57:58.705
So, what do you think?

636
00:57:59.957 --> 00:58:01.959
Does it come in black?

637
00:58:02.584 --> 00:58:04.962
I need you at the docks Thursday.

638
00:58:05.212 --> 00:58:07.089
- Problems?
- I don't want any trouble...

639
00:58:07.255 --> 00:58:09.383
...with the last shipment.
- Sure.

640
00:58:10.968 --> 00:58:14.638
Word on the street is you got a beef
with somebody in the DA's office.

641
00:58:14.805 --> 00:58:17.224
- Is that right?
- And that there's a fat prize...

642
00:58:17.391 --> 00:58:20.102
...waiting for anybody willing
to do anything about it.

643
00:58:20.268 --> 00:58:22.229
So, what's your point, Mr. Flass?

644
00:58:22.688 --> 00:58:23.939
Have you seen the girl?

645
00:58:24.439 --> 00:58:27.109
It's a cute little assistant D A.

646
00:58:27.276 --> 00:58:30.946
Don 't you think that's a little too much
heat to bring down, maybe?

647
00:58:31.113 --> 00:58:34.449
- Even for this town.
- Never underestimate Gotham City.

648
00:58:34.616 --> 00:58:37.452
People get mugged coming home
from work every day of the week.

649
00:58:37.619 --> 00:58:40.247
Sometimes...
Sometimes things just go bad.

650
00:58:44.126 --> 00:58:45.919
It's a problem with the graphite, sir.

651
00:58:46.128 --> 00:58:48.797
The next 10,000
will be up to specifications.

652
00:58:48.964 --> 00:58:51.550
- At least they gave us a discount.
- Quite.

653
00:58:51.717 --> 00:58:57.347
In the meantime, sir, may I suggest
you try to avoid landing on your head?

654
00:59:34.343 --> 00:59:36.386
Why bats, Master Wayne?

655
00:59:36.637 --> 00:59:37.888
Bats frighten me.

656
00:59:39.181 --> 00:59:41.475
It's time my enemies shared my dread.

657
01:00:08.168 --> 01:00:10.087
What is this?

658
01:00:13.882 --> 01:00:15.217
Continue.

659
01:00:20.722 --> 01:00:22.391
Looks fine out there.

660
01:00:22.808 --> 01:00:24.726
The bears go straight to the dealers.

661
01:00:24.893 --> 01:00:27.562
Yeah, and the rabbits go
to the man in the Narrows.

662
01:00:27.729 --> 01:00:30.732
- What's the difference?
- Ignorance is bliss, my friend.

663
01:00:30.899 --> 01:00:34.069
Don't burden yourself
with the secrets of scary people.

664
01:00:49.918 --> 01:00:52.921
Hey. Steiss.

665
01:01:14.234 --> 01:01:15.694
Steiss?

666
01:01:27.623 --> 01:01:29.249
What?

667
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.460
What the...?

668
01:01:40.469 --> 01:01:42.304
I better check it.

669
01:01:54.858 --> 01:01:56.860
There's a problem out here.
You better bail.

670
01:02:26.181 --> 01:02:27.808
Where are you?!

671
01:02:27.975 --> 01:02:29.017
Here.

672
01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.375
Get going. Oh, shit.

673
01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.687
What the hell are you?

674
01:03:16.732 --> 01:03:17.899
I'm Batman.

675
01:03:26.241 --> 01:03:28.201
Nice coat.

676
01:03:29.911 --> 01:03:31.455
Thanks.

677
01:04:12.496 --> 01:04:13.747
Hold it.

678
01:04:15.874 --> 01:04:18.335
That's right, you better run.

679
01:04:27.302 --> 01:04:29.137
Falcone sent them to kill you.

680
01:04:30.263 --> 01:04:32.849
- Why?
- You rattled his cage.

681
01:04:36.645 --> 01:04:38.188
- What's this?
- Leverage.

682
01:04:38.355 --> 01:04:39.982
- For what?
- To get things moving.

683
01:04:40.274 --> 01:04:42.276
Who are you?

684
01:04:42.651 --> 01:04:43.902
Someone like you.

685
01:04:44.069 --> 01:04:46.113
Someone who'll rattle the cages.

686
01:04:51.201 --> 01:04:54.705
Ma'am? Everything okay?

687
01:04:59.001 --> 01:05:01.503
- Falcone's men?
- Does it matter?

688
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:03.964
We'll never tie him to it anyway.

689
01:05:04.172 --> 01:05:06.300
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

690
01:05:19.354 --> 01:05:21.189
What the hell is that?

691
01:05:30.782 --> 01:05:32.034
Cut him down.

692
01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:55.891
Unacceptable.

693
01:05:56.058 --> 01:05:58.894
Now, I don't care if it's rival gangs,
Guardian Angels...

694
01:05:59.061 --> 01:06:01.021
...or the goddamn Salvation Army...

695
01:06:01.271 --> 01:06:03.607
...get them off the street
and off the front page.

696
01:06:03.774 --> 01:06:06.360
They say it was just one guy.
Or a creature.

697
01:06:06.526 --> 01:06:09.237
It was some asshole in a costume.

698
01:06:09.738 --> 01:06:11.406
- Yeah?
- This guy did deliver us...

699
01:06:11.573 --> 01:06:14.368
...one of the city's biggest crime lords.

700
01:06:14.534 --> 01:06:18.038
No one takes the law
into their own hands in my city.

701
01:06:18.205 --> 01:06:19.414
Understand?

702
01:06:19.706 --> 01:06:22.167
- No way to bury it now.
- There's still Judge Faden.

703
01:06:22.334 --> 01:06:25.420
- I've got Faden covered.
- What about this bat they babble about?

704
01:06:25.587 --> 01:06:28.715
Even if these guys will swear
to being thrashed by a giant bat...

705
01:06:28.882 --> 01:06:31.051
...we've got Falcone at the scene.

706
01:06:31.218 --> 01:06:34.429
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests.
This bat character gave us everything.

707
01:06:34.846 --> 01:06:36.390
Okay. Let's do it.

708
01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:41.937
- Bats are nocturnal.
- Bats may be.

709
01:06:42.104 --> 01:06:45.524
But even for billionaire playboys,
3:00 is pushing it.

710
01:06:46.566 --> 01:06:49.444
The price for leading a double life,
I fear.

711
01:06:50.779 --> 01:06:53.198
Your theatrics made an impression.

712
01:06:54.574 --> 01:06:57.619
Theatricality and deception...

713
01:06:57.786 --> 01:07:00.998
...are powerful weapons, Alfred.
This is a good start.

714
01:07:01.164 --> 01:07:03.959
If those are to be the first
of many injuries to come...

715
01:07:04.126 --> 01:07:06.962
...it would be wise
to find a suitable excuse.

716
01:07:07.296 --> 01:07:08.630
Polo, for instance.

717
01:07:08.797 --> 01:07:10.465
I'm not learning polo, Alfred.

718
01:07:10.716 --> 01:07:14.386
Strange injuries,
a nonexistent social life.

719
01:07:14.553 --> 01:07:16.013
These things beg the question...

720
01:07:16.179 --> 01:07:20.434
...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne
do with his time and his money.

721
01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:22.185
What does someone like me do?

722
01:07:23.145 --> 01:07:27.357
Drive sports cars, date movie stars.

723
01:07:28.025 --> 01:07:29.610
Buy things that are not for sale.

724
01:07:29.776 --> 01:07:33.322
Who knows, Master Wayne,
you start pretending to have fun...

725
01:07:33.947 --> 01:07:35.949
...you might even have a little
by accident.

726
01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:40.120
Sir.

727
01:07:40.287 --> 01:07:42.623
- We have a situation.
- All right.

728
01:07:42.998 --> 01:07:46.835
The Coast Guard picked up
one of our cargo ships last night...

729
01:07:47.377 --> 01:07:52.174
...heavily damaged, all crew missing,
probably dead.

730
01:07:54.217 --> 01:07:56.595
The ship was carrying
a prototype weapon.

731
01:07:56.803 --> 01:07:58.597
It's a microwave emitter.

732
01:07:58.764 --> 01:08:01.725
It's designed for desert warfare,
but it...

733
01:08:03.393 --> 01:08:04.978
It looks like somebody...

734
01:08:09.358 --> 01:08:10.859
...turned it on.

735
01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:19.493
It uses focused microwaves to
vaporize the enemy's water supply.

736
01:08:27.417 --> 01:08:30.379
The damage to the ship
was catastrophic.

737
01:08:30.545 --> 01:08:33.548
The weapon itself is...

738
01:08:34.841 --> 01:08:36.343
Missing?

739
01:08:37.177 --> 01:08:38.428
Yeah.

740
01:08:39.721 --> 01:08:41.682
Mr. Wayne.

741
01:08:45.394 --> 01:08:46.853
Nice car.

742
01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:48.397
You should see my other one.

743
01:08:58.407 --> 01:09:00.367
He's done something
the police never have.

744
01:09:00.534 --> 01:09:02.828
You can't take the law
into your own hands.

745
01:09:02.995 --> 01:09:05.580
Well, at least he's getting
something done.

746
01:09:05.747 --> 01:09:08.083
Bruce, help me out here.

747
01:09:08.250 --> 01:09:12.587
Well, a guy who dresses up
like a bat clearly has issues.

748
01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:15.882
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

749
01:09:16.049 --> 01:09:18.427
And now the cops want him.
What does that tell you?

750
01:09:18.593 --> 01:09:19.803
They're jealous.

751
01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:22.597
Sir, the pool is for decoration...

752
01:09:22.764 --> 01:09:26.143
...and your friends
do not have swimwear.

753
01:09:27.936 --> 01:09:29.938
Well, they're European.

754
01:09:31.773 --> 01:09:34.151
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

755
01:09:35.068 --> 01:09:38.530
- It is not a question of money.
- Well, you see...

756
01:09:39.114 --> 01:09:40.907
...I'm buying this hotel...

757
01:09:42.701 --> 01:09:47.122
...and setting some new rules
about the pool area.

758
01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:50.667
I think the Batman deserves a medal.

759
01:09:50.834 --> 01:09:52.961
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

760
01:09:59.468 --> 01:10:01.053
Thank you.

761
01:10:02.804 --> 01:10:04.139
Bruce?

762
01:10:07.726 --> 01:10:09.519
Rachel?

763
01:10:09.686 --> 01:10:11.104
I'd heard you were back.

764
01:10:13.148 --> 01:10:14.650
What are you doing?

765
01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:19.821
Just swimming here.
Wow, it is good to see you.

766
01:10:19.988 --> 01:10:21.531
You were gone a long time.

767
01:10:22.115 --> 01:10:25.035
- I know. How are things?
- The same.

768
01:10:26.954 --> 01:10:28.622
Job's getting worse.

769
01:10:28.789 --> 01:10:31.500
Can't change the world on your own.

770
01:10:31.667 --> 01:10:33.752
What choice do I have...

771
01:10:34.419 --> 01:10:36.171
...when you're too busy swimming?

772
01:10:37.506 --> 01:10:39.549
Rachel, all of...

773
01:10:39.841 --> 01:10:41.510
All this...

774
01:10:42.928 --> 01:10:46.974
It's... It's not me. It's...

775
01:10:47.391 --> 01:10:50.018
Inside, I am...

776
01:10:51.228 --> 01:10:53.188
I am more.

777
01:10:53.855 --> 01:10:55.399
Come on, Bruce. Come on.

778
01:10:55.565 --> 01:10:59.361
Bruce, we have some more hotels
for you to buy.

779
01:11:00.404 --> 01:11:01.863
Bruce...

780
01:11:03.031 --> 01:11:06.535
...deep down you may still be
that same great kid you used to be.

781
01:11:08.954 --> 01:11:11.540
But it's not who you are underneath...

782
01:11:11.999 --> 01:11:13.750
...it's what you do that defines you.

783
01:11:26.305 --> 01:11:27.889
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.

784
01:11:28.056 --> 01:11:30.934
Not at all. He cut his wrists?

785
01:11:31.101 --> 01:11:34.771
Probably looking for the insanity plea.
But if anything should happen...

786
01:11:34.938 --> 01:11:37.899
Of course, better safe than sorry.

787
01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:44.906
Yeah, Dr. Crane, I can't take it anymore.
It's all too much.

788
01:11:45.073 --> 01:11:47.534
The walls are closing in.
Blah, blah, blah.

789
01:11:48.076 --> 01:11:50.579
A couple of days of this food,
it'll be true.

790
01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:53.248
- What do you want?
- I wanna know...

791
01:11:53.415 --> 01:11:55.917
...how you're gonna convince me
to keep my mouth shut.

792
01:11:56.084 --> 01:11:58.253
About what?
You don't know anything.

793
01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:02.591
I know you don't want the cops to take
a closer look at the drugs they seized.

794
01:12:02.758 --> 01:12:06.928
And I know about your experiments
with the inmates of your nut house.

795
01:12:07.095 --> 01:12:10.766
See, I don't go into business with a guy
without finding out his dirty secrets.

796
01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:14.269
And those goons you used.

797
01:12:14.436 --> 01:12:16.271
I own the muscle in this town.

798
01:12:16.438 --> 01:12:19.816
Now, I've been bringing
your stuff in for months...

799
01:12:20.359 --> 01:12:24.571
...so whatever he's planning,
it's big, and I want in.

800
01:12:25.864 --> 01:12:28.992
Well, I already know what he'll say.

801
01:12:29.409 --> 01:12:30.786
That we should kill you.

802
01:12:32.663 --> 01:12:35.958
Even he can't get me in here.
Not in my town.

803
01:12:41.922 --> 01:12:43.465
Would you like to see my mask?

804
01:12:45.008 --> 01:12:46.468
I use it in my experiments.

805
01:12:48.971 --> 01:12:53.433
Now, I'm probably not very frightening
to a guy like you.

806
01:12:53.809 --> 01:12:56.645
But these crazies, they can't stand it.

807
01:12:57.562 --> 01:12:59.523
So when did the nut
take over the nut house?

808
01:13:00.482 --> 01:13:03.151
They scream and they cry...

809
01:13:04.152 --> 01:13:05.779
...much as you're doing now.

810
01:13:08.115 --> 01:13:11.326
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.

811
01:13:11.493 --> 01:13:14.037
I'll talk to the judge
and see if I can get him moved...

812
01:13:14.204 --> 01:13:17.624
...to the secure wing at Arkham.
I can't treat him here.

813
01:13:39.646 --> 01:13:41.148
Storm's coming.

814
01:13:45.736 --> 01:13:48.739
The scum is getting jumpy
because you stood up to Falcone.

815
01:13:48.905 --> 01:13:52.451
It's a start. Your partner
was at the docks with Falcone.

816
01:13:52.618 --> 01:13:55.329
Well, he moonlights
as a low-level enforcer.

817
01:13:55.704 --> 01:13:59.499
They were splitting the shipment in two.
Only half went to the dealers.

818
01:13:59.666 --> 01:14:01.585
Why? What about the other half?

819
01:14:02.044 --> 01:14:04.463
- Flass knows.
- He won't talk.

820
01:14:05.088 --> 01:14:06.673
He'll talk to me.

821
01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:09.885
Commissioner Loeb set up
a massive task force to catch you.

822
01:14:10.344 --> 01:14:12.888
- He thinks you're dangerous.
- What do you think?

823
01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:17.059
I think you're trying to help.

824
01:14:22.064 --> 01:14:24.399
But I've been wrong before.

825
01:14:30.197 --> 01:14:31.907
Come on, I ain't got all night.

826
01:14:35.243 --> 01:14:37.079
Flass, I have kids to feed.

827
01:14:37.537 --> 01:14:39.706
What, they don't like falafel?

828
01:14:55.097 --> 01:14:56.807
Where were the other drugs going?

829
01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:00.269
I never knew. I don't know.

830
01:15:00.435 --> 01:15:02.646
- I swear to God.
- Swear to me!

831
01:15:08.277 --> 01:15:11.280
I don't... I don't know.
I never knew. Never.

832
01:15:11.571 --> 01:15:15.033
They went to some guy for a couple days
before they went to the dealers.

833
01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.493
Why?

834
01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:20.747
There was something...
Something else in the drugs...

835
01:15:20.914 --> 01:15:22.499
...something hidden.
- What?

836
01:15:22.666 --> 01:15:26.003
I never went to the drop-off point.
It was in the Narrows.

837
01:15:26.169 --> 01:15:29.464
- Cops only go there in force.
- Do I look like a cop?

838
01:15:29.631 --> 01:15:31.425
No...

839
01:15:45.022 --> 01:15:47.065
This is the one I'm talking about.

840
01:15:47.357 --> 01:15:49.651
- What's your problem with it?
- It shouldn't exist.

841
01:15:49.818 --> 01:15:53.655
This ship left Singapore with
246 containers, but arrived with 247.

842
01:15:53.822 --> 01:15:56.199
I'm guessing there's something
I'm not supposed to find in there.

843
01:15:56.366 --> 01:15:59.786
Listen, counselor, we don't wanna
know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.

844
01:15:59.953 --> 01:16:03.290
Things are working a little
differently now. Open it up.

845
01:16:12.883 --> 01:16:14.134
What the hell is this?

846
01:16:56.718 --> 01:16:59.888
It's you, isn't it?
Everybody's been talking about you.

847
01:17:00.472 --> 01:17:02.224
Get in here!

848
01:17:02.849 --> 01:17:04.977
The other kids won't believe me.

849
01:17:28.083 --> 01:17:30.210
Get rid of all traces.

850
01:17:30.502 --> 01:17:33.422
- Better torch the whole place.
- All right.

851
01:18:09.458 --> 01:18:11.251
Having trouble?

852
01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:14.296
Take a seat. Have a drink.

853
01:18:15.005 --> 01:18:18.258
You look like a man
who takes himself too seriously.

854
01:18:21.970 --> 01:18:24.973
Do you want my opinion?
You need to lighten up.

855
01:19:16.942 --> 01:19:20.654
Alfred, help me.

856
01:19:30.539 --> 01:19:33.917
Blood. Take. Take poison.
Blood poison.

857
01:19:34.084 --> 01:19:37.087
Poisonous. Poisonous.

858
01:19:41.383 --> 01:19:43.093
Bruce...

859
01:19:44.386 --> 01:19:45.554
...why do we fall?

860
01:19:57.649 --> 01:20:00.986
- How long was I out?
- Two days.

861
01:20:01.361 --> 01:20:03.196
It's your birthday.

862
01:20:04.531 --> 01:20:05.782
Many happy returns.

863
01:20:10.996 --> 01:20:14.791
I've felt these effects before,
but this was so much more potent.

864
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.546
It was some kind of hallucinogen,
weaponized, in aerosol form.

865
01:20:19.755 --> 01:20:22.674
You have been hanging out
in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

866
01:20:22.883 --> 01:20:25.969
I called Mr. Fox when your condition
worsened after the first day.

867
01:20:26.136 --> 01:20:27.512
I analyzed your blood...

868
01:20:27.679 --> 01:20:31.141
...isolating the receptor compounds
and the protein-based catalyst.

869
01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:33.143
Am I meant to understand any of that?

870
01:20:33.518 --> 01:20:36.647
Not at all. I just wanted you to know
how hard it was.

871
01:20:37.272 --> 01:20:40.943
- Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote.
- Could you make more?

872
01:20:41.151 --> 01:20:43.695
You planning on gassing yourself
again, Mr. Wayne?

873
01:20:43.904 --> 01:20:47.074
Well, you know how it is.
You're out at night, looking for kicks...

874
01:20:47.282 --> 01:20:50.035
...someone's passing around
the weaponized hallucinogens...

875
01:20:50.202 --> 01:20:53.622
I'll bring what I have.
The antidote should inoculate you for now.

876
01:20:53.830 --> 01:20:56.166
Alfred, always a pleasure.

877
01:20:56.375 --> 01:20:58.001
Lucius.

878
01:21:02.547 --> 01:21:05.217
- You sure you don't want to come in?
- I have to get back.

879
01:21:05.384 --> 01:21:07.094
- I wanted to leave this.
- Thank you.

880
01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:08.637
Rachel?

881
01:21:10.013 --> 01:21:13.183
Looks like someone's been
burning the candle at both ends.

882
01:21:13.392 --> 01:21:16.061
- Must've been quite an occasion.
- It is my birthday.

883
01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:19.898
I know. I'm sorry I can't come tonight.
I was just dropping off your present.

884
01:21:20.107 --> 01:21:23.527
- You've got better plans?
- My boss has been missing for days...

885
01:21:23.735 --> 01:21:27.406
...which means I should probably start
by looking at the bottom of the river.

886
01:21:27.614 --> 01:21:29.074
- Rachel.
- Excuse me.

887
01:21:31.994 --> 01:21:33.203
Rachel Dawes.

888
01:21:33.829 --> 01:21:37.416
Who authorized that? Get Crane down
there now. Don't take no for an answer.

889
01:21:37.624 --> 01:21:41.461
Call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our
own assessment to the judge by morning.

890
01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:43.714
- What's wrong?
- It's Falcone.

891
01:21:43.922 --> 01:21:46.383
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum
on suicide watch.

892
01:21:46.591 --> 01:21:49.594
You're going to Arkham now?
It's in the Narrows, Rachel.

893
01:21:50.846 --> 01:21:52.639
You enjoy your party, Bruce.

894
01:21:52.848 --> 01:21:55.601
- Some of us have work to do.
- You be careful.

895
01:21:57.352 --> 01:21:58.895
Happy birthday.

896
01:22:18.332 --> 01:22:20.417
But, Master Wayne,
the guests will be arriving.

897
01:22:20.626 --> 01:22:22.252
Keep them happy until I arrive.

898
01:22:22.419 --> 01:22:24.588
Tell them that joke you know.

899
01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:05.170
Having fun?

900
01:23:07.297 --> 01:23:10.842
Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you
doing in a place like this?

901
01:23:11.051 --> 01:23:12.302
I need some information.

902
01:23:12.511 --> 01:23:17.266
The Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1 -ME.

903
01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:20.060
1 -ME.

904
01:23:20.269 --> 01:23:23.981
It's a microwave emitter. It was designed
to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

905
01:23:24.189 --> 01:23:28.402
Rumor was they tested dispersing
water-based chemicals into the air...

906
01:23:28.568 --> 01:23:30.487
...but isn't that illegal?

907
01:23:32.239 --> 01:23:36.451
I want all the information
on the development of this project...

908
01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:40.622
...all data, files, backup disks,
on my desk right away.

909
01:23:41.039 --> 01:23:42.666
Did you lose one?

910
01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:47.337
I'm merging your department
with Archives.

911
01:23:48.588 --> 01:23:49.840
And I am firing you.

912
01:23:52.009 --> 01:23:53.969
Didn't you get the memo?

913
01:24:01.226 --> 01:24:02.853
Scarecrow.

914
01:24:06.189 --> 01:24:08.025
Scarecrow.

915
01:24:11.403 --> 01:24:12.696
Scarecrow.

916
01:24:15.741 --> 01:24:17.909
Miss Dawes, this is most irregular.

917
01:24:18.118 --> 01:24:21.038
I have nothing to add
to the report I filed with the judge.

918
01:24:21.204 --> 01:24:23.415
- I have questions about your report.
- Such as?

919
01:24:23.624 --> 01:24:27.919
Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man
who has no history of mental illness...

920
01:24:28.086 --> 01:24:31.673
...to have a psychotic breakdown
just when he's about to be indicted?

921
01:24:31.882 --> 01:24:36.094
As you can see for yourself, there is
nothing convenient about his symptoms.

922
01:24:40.766 --> 01:24:42.142
- Scarecrow.
- What's "scarecrow"?

923
01:24:42.643 --> 01:24:46.229
Patients suffering delusional episodes
often focus their paranoia...

924
01:24:46.438 --> 01:24:48.523
...on an external tormentor...

925
01:24:48.732 --> 01:24:51.902
...usually one conforming
to Jungian archetypes.

926
01:24:52.152 --> 01:24:54.529
In this case, a scarecrow.

927
01:24:56.031 --> 01:25:00.160
- He's drugged?
- Psychopharmacology is my primary field.

928
01:25:00.327 --> 01:25:01.703
I'm a strong advocate.

929
01:25:02.621 --> 01:25:04.790
Outside, he was a giant.

930
01:25:04.998 --> 01:25:07.417
In here, only the mind
can grant you power.

931
01:25:07.626 --> 01:25:09.336
You enjoy the reversal.

932
01:25:09.544 --> 01:25:12.547
I respect the mind's power
over the body.

933
01:25:12.714 --> 01:25:14.257
It's why I do what I do.

934
01:25:14.424 --> 01:25:19.304
I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone
behind bars, not in therapy.

935
01:25:19.513 --> 01:25:22.766
I want my own psychiatric consultant
to have full access to Falcone...

936
01:25:22.975 --> 01:25:26.311
...including blood work.
Find out what exactly you put him on.

937
01:25:26.478 --> 01:25:28.939
- First thing tomorrow, then.
- Tonight.

938
01:25:29.147 --> 01:25:32.567
I've already paged Dr. Lehmann
at County General.

939
01:25:33.986 --> 01:25:35.779
As you wish.

940
01:25:41.326 --> 01:25:43.287
This way, please.

941
01:25:43.453 --> 01:25:46.039
There's something
I think you should see.

942
01:25:56.967 --> 01:25:59.553
This is where we make the medicine.

943
01:26:06.393 --> 01:26:10.272
Perhaps you should have some,
clear your head.

944
01:26:35.547 --> 01:26:37.174
Who knows you're here?

945
01:26:38.216 --> 01:26:39.843
Who knows?

946
01:26:47.059 --> 01:26:48.268
He's here.

947
01:26:48.477 --> 01:26:49.686
Who?

948
01:26:49.895 --> 01:26:51.855
The Batman.

949
01:26:53.649 --> 01:26:55.525
- What do we do?
- What anyone does...

950
01:26:55.734 --> 01:26:58.487
...when a prowler comes around.

951
01:26:59.446 --> 01:27:01.990
- Call the police.
- You want the cops here?

952
01:27:02.574 --> 01:27:05.327
At this point, they can't stop us.

953
01:27:05.535 --> 01:27:09.039
But the Batman
has a talent for disruption.

954
01:27:09.247 --> 01:27:12.417
Force him outside,
the police will take him down. Go.

955
01:27:12.626 --> 01:27:14.711
- What about her?
- She hasn't got long.

956
01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:16.880
I gave her a concentrated dose.

957
01:27:17.047 --> 01:27:19.591
The mind can only take so much.
Now go.

958
01:27:22.135 --> 01:27:24.388
The things they say about him.

959
01:27:24.596 --> 01:27:26.139
Can he really fly?

960
01:27:26.306 --> 01:27:28.350
I heard he can disappear.

961
01:27:28.558 --> 01:27:31.561
Well, we'll find out.

962
01:27:31.853 --> 01:27:33.480
Won't we?

963
01:28:20.819 --> 01:28:22.946
Taste of your own medicine, doctor?

964
01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:31.455
What have you been doing here?

965
01:28:34.583 --> 01:28:36.960
Who are you working for?

966
01:28:41.423 --> 01:28:43.759
Ra's... Ra's al Ghul.

967
01:28:43.967 --> 01:28:48.805
Ra's al Ghul is dead.
Who are you working for?

968
01:28:49.014 --> 01:28:50.015
Crane.

969
01:28:52.517 --> 01:28:55.437
Dr. Crane isn't here right now.

970
01:28:56.021 --> 01:28:57.898
But if you'd like to make
an appointment...

971
01:29:10.953 --> 01:29:13.872
Batman, put down your weapons
and surrender.

972
01:29:14.581 --> 01:29:15.958
You're surrounded.

973
01:29:21.546 --> 01:29:24.299
- What are you waiting for?
- Backup.

974
01:29:25.050 --> 01:29:27.427
- Backup?
- The Batman's in there.

975
01:29:27.636 --> 01:29:29.763
SWAT's on the way.
But if you wanna go in now...

976
01:29:29.972 --> 01:29:31.515
...I'll be right behind you, sir.

977
01:29:33.016 --> 01:29:34.559
SWAT's on the way.

978
01:29:35.644 --> 01:29:36.895
- Hey.
- Hey.

979
01:30:19.438 --> 01:30:21.148
What's happened to her?

980
01:30:23.817 --> 01:30:27.571
Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic
hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin.

981
01:30:29.615 --> 01:30:33.327
- Let me get her down to the medics.
- They can't help her, but I can.

982
01:30:37.289 --> 01:30:39.416
Get her downstairs.
Meet me in the alley.

983
01:30:47.424 --> 01:30:50.260
Crane's been smuggling his toxin
hidden in Falcone's drugs...

984
01:30:50.469 --> 01:30:52.596
...and they're dumping it
into the water supply.

985
01:30:53.138 --> 01:30:54.765
- What was he planning?
- I don't know.

986
01:30:55.015 --> 01:30:56.308
Was he working for Falcone?

987
01:30:56.808 --> 01:30:59.311
He mentioned someone else,
someone worse.

988
01:30:59.519 --> 01:31:02.064
She needs the antidote
before the damage is permanent.

989
01:31:02.272 --> 01:31:04.441
- How long does she have?
- Not long.

990
01:31:08.362 --> 01:31:10.155
What is that?

991
01:31:11.531 --> 01:31:13.784
- Backup.
- What the...?

992
01:32:31.753 --> 01:32:33.296
Excuse me.

993
01:32:38.051 --> 01:32:41.262
- How is she?
- She's fading. We gotta go.

994
01:32:43.139 --> 01:32:44.599
I'll get my car.

995
01:32:44.766 --> 01:32:46.559
I brought mine.

996
01:32:46.976 --> 01:32:48.603
Yours?

997
01:32:57.945 --> 01:32:59.739
I've gotta get me one of those.

998
01:33:00.990 --> 01:33:03.117
- He is in a vehicle.
- Make and color?

999
01:33:03.326 --> 01:33:05.662
It's a black...

1000
01:33:06.996 --> 01:33:08.289
...tank.

1001
01:33:10.958 --> 01:33:12.335
Stay calm.

1002
01:33:13.002 --> 01:33:14.796
You've been poisoned.

1003
01:33:17.507 --> 01:33:18.800
I'm on him.

1004
01:33:27.225 --> 01:33:28.267
Breathe slowly.

1005
01:33:38.403 --> 01:33:39.487
Hold on.

1006
01:33:54.002 --> 01:33:55.378
- What are you doing?
- Shortcut.

1007
01:34:03.886 --> 01:34:05.680
Air One to ground, block that ramp.

1008
01:34:10.226 --> 01:34:11.853
He's got no way off that roof.

1009
01:34:13.229 --> 01:34:16.315
Turn off your engine.
Step away from the car.

1010
01:34:18.693 --> 01:34:21.446
- Trust me.
- Weapons system activated.

1011
01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:40.631
Who is this guy?

1012
01:34:40.965 --> 01:34:42.675
- Where's he going?
- He's on the roof.

1013
01:34:57.106 --> 01:34:59.275
- What street is he taking?
- He's not on a street.

1014
01:34:59.484 --> 01:35:01.194
He's flying on rooftops.

1015
01:35:40.441 --> 01:35:42.652
At least tell me what it looks like.

1016
01:35:45.697 --> 01:35:47.156
Never mind.

1017
01:35:51.035 --> 01:35:52.412
Got him.

1018
01:36:03.297 --> 01:36:04.841
Coming right up on his butt.

1019
01:36:29.574 --> 01:36:31.993
We're tracking suspect vehicle
heading west on l- 17.

1020
01:36:37.290 --> 01:36:39.000
- Air One to ground.
- I lost him.

1021
01:36:39.167 --> 01:36:41.002
We've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked.

1022
01:36:41.210 --> 01:36:43.171
We'll loop back to check
the frontage road.

1023
01:36:43.379 --> 01:36:45.465
Stealth mode activated.

1024
01:36:46.132 --> 01:36:47.342
Stay with me.

1025
01:36:53.556 --> 01:36:55.016
What...? There he is.

1026
01:37:14.744 --> 01:37:16.204
Just hold on.

1027
01:37:20.166 --> 01:37:21.334
Rachel!

1028
01:37:54.117 --> 01:37:56.452
- They get any of this into the mains?
- Yeah.

1029
01:37:56.661 --> 01:37:59.497
Notify the water company.
There's gotta be a way to isolate it.

1030
01:37:59.706 --> 01:38:02.542
No. They put it all in.
They must've been at this for weeks.

1031
01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:06.295
- Gotham's entire water supply is laced.
- Why haven't we felt the effects?

1032
01:38:06.504 --> 01:38:08.756
Must be a compound that has
to be absorbed through the lungs.

1033
01:38:19.017 --> 01:38:20.727
How do you feel?

1034
01:38:23.479 --> 01:38:24.939
Where are we?

1035
01:38:25.481 --> 01:38:29.235
- Why did you bring me here?
- lf I hadn't, your mind would be lost.

1036
01:38:29.444 --> 01:38:31.446
- You were poisoned.
- It was...

1037
01:38:31.654 --> 01:38:35.241
- It was Dr. Crane.
- Rest. Gordon has Crane.

1038
01:38:35.450 --> 01:38:37.535
Is Sergeant Gordon your friend?

1039
01:38:38.411 --> 01:38:40.038
I don't have the luxury of friends.

1040
01:38:40.955 --> 01:38:44.292
I'm gonna give you a sedative.
You'll wake up back at home.

1041
01:38:44.459 --> 01:38:48.379
When you do, get these to Gordon,
and Gordon alone. Trust no one.

1042
01:38:48.588 --> 01:38:50.298
- What are they?
- The antidote.

1043
01:38:50.506 --> 01:38:53.801
One for Gordon to inoculate himself,
the other for mass production.

1044
01:38:54.218 --> 01:38:55.470
Mass production?

1045
01:38:55.678 --> 01:38:58.806
Crane was just a pawn.
We need to be ready.

1046
01:39:24.791 --> 01:39:28.169
When you told me your grand plan
for saving Gotham...

1047
01:39:28.378 --> 01:39:31.297
...all that stopped me
from calling the men in white coats...

1048
01:39:31.464 --> 01:39:33.925
...was when you said
it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

1049
01:39:34.133 --> 01:39:37.136
- It's not.
- What would you call that?

1050
01:39:39.013 --> 01:39:41.683
- Damn good television.
- It's a miracle no one was killed.

1051
01:39:41.891 --> 01:39:45.520
I didn't have time to observe
the rules of the road, Alfred.

1052
01:39:45.728 --> 01:39:48.815
You're getting lost inside
this monster of yours.

1053
01:39:49.023 --> 01:39:53.403
I'm using this monster to help
other people, just like my father did.

1054
01:39:53.611 --> 01:39:55.154
For Thomas Wayne, helping others...

1055
01:39:55.363 --> 01:39:58.282
...wasn't about proving anything
to anyone, including himself.

1056
01:39:58.741 --> 01:40:02.078
It's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.

1057
01:40:02.537 --> 01:40:05.123
She's downstairs, sedated.
I need you to take her home.

1058
01:40:05.456 --> 01:40:09.043
Well, we both care for Rachel, but what
you're doing has to be beyond that.

1059
01:40:09.377 --> 01:40:12.296
It can't be personal,
or you're just a vigilante.

1060
01:40:12.463 --> 01:40:14.298
- Is Fox still here?
- Yes, sir.

1061
01:40:14.507 --> 01:40:16.134
We need to send these people away.

1062
01:40:16.342 --> 01:40:19.262
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests.
You have a name to maintain.

1063
01:40:19.470 --> 01:40:21.264
I don't care about my name.

1064
01:40:21.472 --> 01:40:24.642
It's not just your name, sir.
It's your father's name.

1065
01:40:26.394 --> 01:40:28.730
And it's all that's left of him.

1066
01:40:30.690 --> 01:40:32.233
Don't destroy it.

1067
01:40:47.582 --> 01:40:49.709
- Mr. Earle.
- Happy birthday, Bruce.

1068
01:40:49.917 --> 01:40:51.294
Thank you.

1069
01:40:51.627 --> 01:40:53.629
How did the stock offering go?

1070
01:40:53.921 --> 01:40:55.089
Prices soared.

1071
01:40:55.298 --> 01:40:56.507
Who was buying?

1072
01:40:56.716 --> 01:40:58.593
All kinds of funds and brokerages.

1073
01:40:58.801 --> 01:41:00.511
It's a bit technical.

1074
01:41:00.678 --> 01:41:02.388
The key thing is...

1075
01:41:02.555 --> 01:41:04.515
...our company's future is secure.

1076
01:41:06.392 --> 01:41:07.393
Great.

1077
01:41:21.115 --> 01:41:23.409
A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.

1078
01:41:29.165 --> 01:41:30.958
What was the plan, Crane?

1079
01:41:31.125 --> 01:41:33.336
How were you gonna get
your toxin into the air?

1080
01:41:33.753 --> 01:41:37.006
Scarecrow. Scarecrow.

1081
01:41:37.215 --> 01:41:39.008
Who were you working for, Crane?

1082
01:41:41.135 --> 01:41:43.304
Oh, it's too late.

1083
01:41:43.930 --> 01:41:46.015
You can't stop it now.

1084
01:41:51.104 --> 01:41:52.647
Here.

1085
01:41:52.814 --> 01:41:54.774
- Happy birthday, Bruce.
- Thank you. Thanks.

1086
01:41:54.983 --> 01:41:57.902
And thank you for that item.

1087
01:41:59.404 --> 01:42:00.613
You're welcome.

1088
01:42:00.822 --> 01:42:03.574
- I know you'll put it to good use.
- I already have.

1089
01:42:03.866 --> 01:42:07.662
How long would it take
to manufacture on a large scale?

1090
01:42:08.246 --> 01:42:09.330
Weeks. Why?

1091
01:42:09.539 --> 01:42:12.667
Somebody's planning to disperse
the toxin using the water supply.

1092
01:42:13.710 --> 01:42:16.796
The water supply won't help you
disperse an inhalant.

1093
01:42:17.714 --> 01:42:19.090
What?

1094
01:42:19.298 --> 01:42:21.801
Unless you have a microwave emitter
powerful enough...

1095
01:42:22.010 --> 01:42:24.846
...to vaporize all the water
in the mains.

1096
01:42:25.304 --> 01:42:28.558
A microwave emitter like the one
Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.

1097
01:42:29.017 --> 01:42:30.184
Misplaced?

1098
01:42:30.393 --> 01:42:33.855
Earle just fired me for asking
too many questions about it.

1099
01:42:35.898 --> 01:42:39.360
Go back to Wayne Enterprises now
and start making more of that antidote.

1100
01:42:39.569 --> 01:42:42.655
The police are gonna need as much
as they can get their hands on.

1101
01:42:42.864 --> 01:42:44.907
My security clearance
has been revoked.

1102
01:42:45.116 --> 01:42:47.076
That wouldn't stop a man like you,
would it?

1103
01:42:47.535 --> 01:42:49.245
I suppose not.

1104
01:42:51.289 --> 01:42:55.918
- Bruce, there's somebody you must meet.
- Not now, Mrs. Delane.

1105
01:42:56.127 --> 01:42:58.963
Now, am I pronouncing this right...

1106
01:42:59.172 --> 01:43:01.591
...Mr. Ra's al Ghul?

1107
01:43:07.263 --> 01:43:09.057
You're not Ra's al Ghul.

1108
01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:11.851
I watched him die.

1109
01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:15.063
But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?

1110
01:43:17.857 --> 01:43:20.276
Are his methods supernatural?

1111
01:43:24.864 --> 01:43:29.243
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal
your true identity, Ra's?

1112
01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:35.583
Surely a man who spends his nights
scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...

1113
01:43:35.792 --> 01:43:37.794
...wouldn't begrudge me
dual identities.

1114
01:43:38.670 --> 01:43:40.463
I saved your life.

1115
01:43:40.630 --> 01:43:43.091
I warned you about compassion, Bruce.

1116
01:43:46.302 --> 01:43:48.471
Your quarrel is with me.

1117
01:43:49.389 --> 01:43:51.849
You let these people go.

1118
01:43:52.141 --> 01:43:55.395
You are welcome to explain
the situation to them.

1119
01:43:57.689 --> 01:43:59.315
Everyone.

1120
01:44:00.108 --> 01:44:01.943
Everybody?

1121
01:44:04.570 --> 01:44:06.447
I...

1122
01:44:06.906 --> 01:44:11.119
I want to thank you all for coming here
tonight and drinking all of my booze.

1123
01:44:13.246 --> 01:44:14.956
No, really.

1124
01:44:15.999 --> 01:44:18.751
There's a thing about being a Wayne...

1125
01:44:18.918 --> 01:44:22.463
...that you're never short of
a few freeloaders, like yourselves...

1126
01:44:22.672 --> 01:44:26.300
...to fill up your mansion with.
So here's to you people. Thank you.

1127
01:44:26.509 --> 01:44:29.095
- That's enough, Bruce.
- I'm not finished.

1128
01:44:29.470 --> 01:44:31.180
To all of you...

1129
01:44:31.347 --> 01:44:35.727
All of you phonies,
all of you two-faced friends...

1130
01:44:35.893 --> 01:44:40.940
...you sycophantic suck-ups
who smile through your teeth at me...

1131
01:44:41.149 --> 01:44:44.694
...please, leave me in peace.

1132
01:44:44.902 --> 01:44:47.488
Please go.

1133
01:44:47.864 --> 01:44:51.242
Stop smiling, it's not a joke.
Please leave.

1134
01:44:51.451 --> 01:44:53.619
The party's over, get out.

1135
01:44:53.828 --> 01:44:57.081
The apple has fallen very far
from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

1136
01:45:01.919 --> 01:45:04.172
He's turning into a jerk.

1137
01:45:10.511 --> 01:45:12.221
Amusing.

1138
01:45:12.555 --> 01:45:15.975
But pointless.
None of these people have long to live.

1139
01:45:16.184 --> 01:45:19.646
Your antics at the asylum
have forced my hand.

1140
01:45:19.854 --> 01:45:21.981
So Crane was working for you.

1141
01:45:22.190 --> 01:45:25.985
His toxin is derived from the organic
compound found in our blue flowers.

1142
01:45:26.361 --> 01:45:28.363
He was able to weaponize it.

1143
01:45:28.571 --> 01:45:30.531
He's not a member of
the League of Shadows?

1144
01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:35.286
Of course not. He thought our plan
was to hold the city to ransom.

1145
01:45:35.995 --> 01:45:40.541
But really, you are gonna release
Crane's poison on the entire city.

1146
01:45:40.708 --> 01:45:44.754
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart
through fear.

1147
01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:59.477
You're gonna destroy millions of lives.

1148
01:45:59.727 --> 01:46:03.064
Only a cynical man would call
what these people have "lives," Wayne.

1149
01:46:03.231 --> 01:46:05.024
Crime. Despair.

1150
01:46:05.233 --> 01:46:07.276
This is not how man
was supposed to live.

1151
01:46:07.944 --> 01:46:11.072
The League of Shadows has been
a check against human corruption...

1152
01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:12.740
...for thousands of years.

1153
01:46:12.949 --> 01:46:16.494
We sacked Rome.
Loaded trade ships with plague rats.

1154
01:46:16.703 --> 01:46:18.079
Burned London to the ground.

1155
01:46:18.287 --> 01:46:21.124
Every time a civilization reaches
the pinnacle of its decadence...

1156
01:46:21.290 --> 01:46:23.251
...we return to restore the balance.

1157
01:46:23.418 --> 01:46:24.961
Gotham isn't beyond saving.

1158
01:46:26.295 --> 01:46:28.965
Give me more time.
There are good people here.

1159
01:46:29.173 --> 01:46:30.967
You're defending a city so corrupt...

1160
01:46:31.175 --> 01:46:34.345
...we have infiltrated
every level of its infrastructure.

1161
01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:46.816
Time to play.

1162
01:46:50.987 --> 01:46:53.656
When I found you in that jail,
you were lost.

1163
01:46:53.823 --> 01:46:55.908
But I believed in you.

1164
01:46:56.117 --> 01:46:59.829
I took away your fear,
and I showed you a path.

1165
01:47:00.121 --> 01:47:02.332
You were my greatest student.

1166
01:47:02.665 --> 01:47:05.793
It should be you standing by my side,
saving the world.

1167
01:47:06.627 --> 01:47:09.213
I'll be standing where I belong.

1168
01:47:09.881 --> 01:47:12.967
Between you
and the people of Gotham.

1169
01:47:14.677 --> 01:47:17.263
No one can save Gotham.

1170
01:47:20.641 --> 01:47:25.271
When a forest grows too wild,
a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

1171
01:47:26.522 --> 01:47:31.152
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror
as its greatest city destroys itself.

1172
01:47:31.736 --> 01:47:34.989
The movement back to harmony
will be unstoppable this time.

1173
01:47:35.281 --> 01:47:37.450
- You attacked Gotham before?
- Of course.

1174
01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:40.370
Over the ages our weapons
have grown more sophisticated.

1175
01:47:40.536 --> 01:47:43.373
With Gotham we tried a new one.
Economics.

1176
01:47:43.831 --> 01:47:48.503
But we underestimated certain
of Gotham's citizens...

1177
01:47:48.961 --> 01:47:51.130
...such as your parents.

1178
01:47:55.218 --> 01:47:58.680
Gunned down by one of the very people
they were trying to help.

1179
01:47:58.971 --> 01:48:01.724
Create enough hunger
and everyone becomes a criminal.

1180
01:48:01.933 --> 01:48:04.352
Their deaths galvanized the city
into saving itself...

1181
01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:07.230
...and Gotham has limped on
ever since.

1182
01:48:07.438 --> 01:48:09.232
We are back to finish the job.

1183
01:48:09.941 --> 01:48:13.194
And this time no misguided idealists
will get in the way.

1184
01:48:13.361 --> 01:48:16.906
Like your father, you lack the courage
to do all that is necessary.

1185
01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:20.076
If someone stands in the way
of true justice...

1186
01:48:20.284 --> 01:48:24.330
...you simply walk up behind them
and stab them in the heart.

1187
01:48:29.377 --> 01:48:31.504
- I am gonna stop you.
- You never did learn...

1188
01:48:31.713 --> 01:48:33.715
...to mind your surroundings.

1189
01:48:35.925 --> 01:48:37.885
Justice is balance.

1190
01:48:38.094 --> 01:48:40.221
You burned my house
and left me for dead.

1191
01:48:42.932 --> 01:48:45.059
Consider us even.

1192
01:49:01.492 --> 01:49:03.202
No one comes out. Make sure.

1193
01:49:13.129 --> 01:49:14.589
They're all gone?

1194
01:49:14.756 --> 01:49:17.508
- How many from maximum security?
- Every one of them.

1195
01:49:17.675 --> 01:49:19.469
Serial killers, rapists.

1196
01:49:19.677 --> 01:49:22.513
Raise the bridges.
We don't want any getting off the island.

1197
01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:24.140
Yeah, I'll raise the bridges...

1198
01:49:24.307 --> 01:49:28.519
...when I get every available unit out here
to catch the homicidal maniacs...

1199
01:49:28.728 --> 01:49:31.564
...that are running loose out there.
- Come on!

1200
01:49:54.796 --> 01:49:57.548
I hope you're not a member
of the fire brigade.

1201
01:50:03.554 --> 01:50:05.640
Master Wayne! Master Wayne!

1202
01:50:10.186 --> 01:50:14.565
What is the point of all those pushups
if you can't even lift a bloody log?

1203
01:50:53.021 --> 01:50:55.064
What have I done, Alfred?

1204
01:50:56.107 --> 01:50:58.026
Everything my family...

1205
01:50:58.234 --> 01:51:00.111
...my father, built...

1206
01:51:02.530 --> 01:51:06.409
The Wayne legacy is more
than bricks and mortar, sir.

1207
01:51:06.617 --> 01:51:08.828
I wanted to save Gotham.

1208
01:51:09.704 --> 01:51:11.539
I failed.

1209
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:14.042
Why do we fall, sir?

1210
01:51:17.253 --> 01:51:20.715
So that we can learn
to pick ourselves up.

1211
01:51:23.217 --> 01:51:25.345
You still haven't given up on me?

1212
01:51:27.263 --> 01:51:28.723
Never.

1213
01:51:29.807 --> 01:51:31.100
Down!

1214
01:51:31.309 --> 01:51:34.228
Harassment! I see harassment!

1215
01:51:34.395 --> 01:51:36.439
Maybe you'd like to see
some excessive force?

1216
01:51:36.648 --> 01:51:38.524
Madman with a gun.

1217
01:51:39.734 --> 01:51:43.071
With residents furious at the
unprecedented show of police strength...

1218
01:51:43.237 --> 01:51:46.616
...to round up the inmates...
- We're about to raise these bridges.

1219
01:51:46.824 --> 01:51:50.411
Officer, I am a Gotham City
district attorney. Let me pass.

1220
01:51:57.835 --> 01:52:00.088
- Just shut up!
- Hey, Flass, cool it!

1221
01:52:00.296 --> 01:52:01.547
Hold these people back.

1222
01:52:01.756 --> 01:52:04.759
Hey, Gordon.
Somebody here to see you.

1223
01:52:04.926 --> 01:52:07.303
- What are you doing here?
- Our friend sent me with this.

1224
01:52:07.512 --> 01:52:08.971
It counteracts Crane's toxin.

1225
01:52:09.138 --> 01:52:10.598
Hopefully you won't need it.

1226
01:52:10.807 --> 01:52:13.935
Not unless he's got some way
of getting that crap into the air.

1227
01:52:15.103 --> 01:52:17.522
All right, last one across.

1228
01:52:18.231 --> 01:52:22.110
People, they want this bridge up
in no more than three minutes!

1229
01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:25.697
Better get you off the island before
they raise the bridges. Patrolman!

1230
01:52:26.364 --> 01:52:27.365
Go!

1231
01:52:54.183 --> 01:52:55.977
I can't find my mom.

1232
01:52:56.352 --> 01:52:57.812
Hey!

1233
01:53:06.237 --> 01:53:07.947
What the hell are you doing?

1234
01:53:09.490 --> 01:53:11.034
Gentlemen...

1235
01:53:11.492 --> 01:53:13.995
...time to spread the word.

1236
01:53:15.747 --> 01:53:17.123
And the word is...

1237
01:53:18.416 --> 01:53:20.126
...panic.

1238
01:53:44.233 --> 01:53:45.860
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.

1239
01:53:46.861 --> 01:53:48.154
Right there.

1240
01:53:48.488 --> 01:53:50.698
That water main
is right under the Narrows.

1241
01:54:07.674 --> 01:54:09.217
It's okay.

1242
01:54:42.083 --> 01:54:43.626
This is Commissioner Loeb.

1243
01:54:43.793 --> 01:54:45.503
Come on, somebody talk to me.

1244
01:54:45.670 --> 01:54:47.130
Come on!

1245
01:55:06.816 --> 01:55:08.818
Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon.

1246
01:55:09.152 --> 01:55:10.445
What the hell is going on?

1247
01:55:10.653 --> 01:55:14.073
We need reinforcements.
TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!

1248
01:55:14.282 --> 01:55:18.494
Gordon! All the city's riot police
are on the island with you!

1249
01:55:18.661 --> 01:55:20.663
Well, they're completely incapacitated!

1250
01:55:20.997 --> 01:55:24.959
It's okay, it's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you.

1251
01:55:25.835 --> 01:55:27.462
Of course they are!

1252
01:55:27.670 --> 01:55:30.673
- Crane?
- No. Scarecrow.

1253
01:55:32.425 --> 01:55:33.801
Gordon...

1254
01:55:34.010 --> 01:55:36.220
...there's nobody left to send in.

1255
01:55:37.805 --> 01:55:39.515
So I'm on my own?

1256
01:55:43.603 --> 01:55:45.229
The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

1257
01:55:45.438 --> 01:55:47.982
This is just the beginning.
If they hit the whole city...

1258
01:55:48.191 --> 01:55:50.943
...there's nothing to stop Gotham
tearing itself apart.

1259
01:55:51.110 --> 01:55:52.987
- How are they gonna do that?
- The train.

1260
01:55:53.196 --> 01:55:56.991
The monorail follows the water mains to
the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.

1261
01:55:57.200 --> 01:55:58.910
If the machine gets to the station...

1262
01:55:59.077 --> 01:56:02.538
...it'll cause a chain reaction
that'll vaporize the city's water supply.

1263
01:56:02.747 --> 01:56:04.290
Covering Gotham in this poison.

1264
01:56:04.499 --> 01:56:07.669
I'm gonna stop him from loading
that train, but I may need your help.

1265
01:56:07.877 --> 01:56:09.671
- What do you need?
- Can you drive stick?

1266
01:56:15.927 --> 01:56:17.553
There you are!

1267
01:56:17.762 --> 01:56:19.722
There is nothing to fear...

1268
01:56:19.931 --> 01:56:21.641
...but fear itself!

1269
01:56:22.725 --> 01:56:25.019
I am here to help!

1270
01:56:56.259 --> 01:56:58.386
Batman will save us. He'll come.

1271
01:57:03.641 --> 01:57:05.518
- He'll come.
- Don't peek.

1272
01:57:14.193 --> 01:57:17.530
This is Gordon.
Prepare to lower the bridge.

1273
01:57:23.453 --> 01:57:25.538
I told you he'd come.

1274
01:57:30.585 --> 01:57:32.211
Wait.

1275
01:57:33.171 --> 01:57:34.797
You could die.

1276
01:57:34.964 --> 01:57:36.215
At least tell me your name.

1277
01:57:41.637 --> 01:57:43.806
It's not who I am underneath...

1278
01:57:44.807 --> 01:57:49.103
...but what I do that defines me.

1279
01:57:49.479 --> 01:57:50.772
Bruce?

1280
01:58:24.514 --> 01:58:27.809
Well, well. You took my advice
about theatricality a bit literally.

1281
01:58:28.017 --> 01:58:30.478
- It ends here.
- For you and the police, maybe.

1282
01:58:30.687 --> 01:58:32.981
My fight, however,
lies with the rest of Gotham.

1283
01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:36.484
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a city to destroy.

1284
01:58:36.693 --> 01:58:40.363
- I can't beat two of your pawns?
- As you wish.

1285
01:58:53.209 --> 01:58:55.503
GPS online.

1286
01:59:02.385 --> 01:59:04.554
In 100 yards.

1287
01:59:35.460 --> 01:59:36.711
Gentlemen.

1288
02:00:04.155 --> 02:00:06.366
Who the hell authorized this?

1289
02:00:16.959 --> 02:00:19.003
Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.

1290
02:00:26.302 --> 02:00:28.888
The pressure's moving along the mains,
blowing the pipes.

1291
02:00:29.097 --> 02:00:30.473
If that pressure reaches us...

1292
02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:33.643
...the water supply right across
the whole city is gonna blow!

1293
02:00:44.112 --> 02:00:46.948
At the next intersection, turn right.

1294
02:01:11.681 --> 02:01:13.141
You will never learn.

1295
02:01:20.690 --> 02:01:21.691
Sorry.

1296
02:01:25.695 --> 02:01:28.698
- Familiar. Don't you have anything new?
- How about this?!

1297
02:01:45.465 --> 02:01:47.717
You have arrived at Wayne Tower.

1298
02:02:01.064 --> 02:02:02.273
Evacuate the building.

1299
02:02:02.523 --> 02:02:04.984
We're on top of the main hub
and it's gonna blow.

1300
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:16.079
Weapons system activated.

1301
02:02:20.208 --> 02:02:21.209
Nice ride.

1302
02:02:36.474 --> 02:02:37.475
Armed.

1303
02:02:49.445 --> 02:02:50.905
Don't be afraid, Bruce.

1304
02:02:53.700 --> 02:02:55.076
Come on. Come on.

1305
02:02:59.831 --> 02:03:01.874
You are just an ordinary man in a cape.

1306
02:03:02.083 --> 02:03:05.920
That's why you couldn't fight injustice,
that's why you can't stop this train.

1307
02:03:06.129 --> 02:03:08.673
Who said anything about stopping it?

1308
02:03:14.512 --> 02:03:16.055
Yes!

1309
02:03:24.230 --> 02:03:27.608
You never learned
to mind your surroundings!

1310
02:03:35.491 --> 02:03:37.952
Have you finally learned to do
what is necessary?

1311
02:03:38.286 --> 02:03:40.538
I won't kill you...

1312
02:03:45.001 --> 02:03:47.128
...but I don't have to save you.

1313
02:05:02.328 --> 02:05:05.415
- The meeting's already started.
- What meeting?

1314
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:12.588
Fox, I seem to remember firing you.

1315
02:05:13.089 --> 02:05:14.632
You did.

1316
02:05:14.841 --> 02:05:16.884
I got another job.

1317
02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:19.220
Yours.

1318
02:05:19.679 --> 02:05:21.389
On whose authority?

1319
02:05:22.015 --> 02:05:23.891
Batman may have made
the front page...

1320
02:05:24.142 --> 02:05:27.061
...but Bruce Wayne
got pushed to page eight.

1321
02:05:33.860 --> 02:05:34.861
Bruce Wayne.

1322
02:05:35.069 --> 02:05:38.823
What makes you think you can decide
who's running Wayne Enterprises?

1323
02:05:39.032 --> 02:05:41.784
- The fact that I'm the owner.
- What are you talking about?

1324
02:05:42.035 --> 02:05:43.911
The company went public a week ago.

1325
02:05:44.120 --> 02:05:45.580
And I bought most of the shares.

1326
02:05:45.955 --> 02:05:49.375
Through various charitable foundations
and trusts and so forth.

1327
02:05:49.584 --> 02:05:52.754
Look, it's all a bit technical,
but the important thing...

1328
02:05:53.004 --> 02:05:56.257
...is that my company's future
is secure.

1329
02:05:56.674 --> 02:05:58.051
Right, Mr. Fox?

1330
02:05:58.259 --> 02:06:00.053
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1331
02:06:02.305 --> 02:06:03.848
Didn't you get the memo?

1332
02:06:22.825 --> 02:06:25.995
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel.
- No. No, Bruce...

1333
02:06:26.204 --> 02:06:27.580
...I'm sorry.

1334
02:06:28.456 --> 02:06:31.125
The day that Chill died, I...

1335
02:06:33.002 --> 02:06:34.629
I said terrible things.

1336
02:06:35.129 --> 02:06:36.839
But true things.

1337
02:06:37.507 --> 02:06:39.300
I was a coward with a gun...

1338
02:06:39.509 --> 02:06:43.262
...and justice is about more
than revenge, so thank you.

1339
02:06:44.347 --> 02:06:47.016
I never stopped thinking about you.

1340
02:06:48.518 --> 02:06:50.144
About us.

1341
02:06:50.770 --> 02:06:52.730
And when I heard you were back, I...

1342
02:06:53.564 --> 02:06:55.733
I started to hope.

1343
02:07:19.841 --> 02:07:22.510
But then I found out about your mask.

1344
02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:26.556
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

1345
02:07:27.181 --> 02:07:28.808
No. This...

1346
02:07:30.018 --> 02:07:31.728
...is your mask.

1347
02:07:33.688 --> 02:07:37.191
Your real face is the one
that criminals now fear.

1348
02:07:38.067 --> 02:07:40.028
The man I loved...

1349
02:07:40.778 --> 02:07:42.238
...the man who vanished...

1350
02:07:43.448 --> 02:07:45.575
...he never came back at all.

1351
02:07:50.079 --> 02:07:52.749
But maybe he's still
out there somewhere.

1352
02:07:54.917 --> 02:07:58.588
Maybe someday,
when Gotham no longer needs Batman...

1353
02:07:59.672 --> 02:08:01.632
...I'll see him again.

1354
02:08:12.685 --> 02:08:15.605
- Proved me wrong, you know.
- About what?

1355
02:08:18.441 --> 02:08:20.860
Your father would be
very proud of you.

1356
02:08:21.110 --> 02:08:22.737
Just like me.

1357
02:08:49.722 --> 02:08:51.599
What will you do?

1358
02:08:52.976 --> 02:08:54.519
Rebuild it.

1359
02:08:55.436 --> 02:08:57.772
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1360
02:09:04.654 --> 02:09:05.863
Just the way it was, sir?

1361
02:09:07.991 --> 02:09:09.200
Yeah, why?

1362
02:09:09.409 --> 02:09:12.245
I thought this might be
a good opportunity for...

1363
02:09:12.412 --> 02:09:14.831
...improving the foundations.

1364
02:09:15.039 --> 02:09:17.959
- In the southeast corner?
- Precisely, sir.

1365
02:09:33.683 --> 02:09:36.519
- Nice.
- I couldn't find any mob bosses.

1366
02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:40.189
- Well, sergeant?
- It's "lieutenant" now.

1367
02:09:40.565 --> 02:09:42.025
You really started something.

1368
02:09:42.233 --> 02:09:44.193
Bent cops running scared.

1369
02:09:44.402 --> 02:09:45.778
Hope on the streets.

1370
02:09:46.070 --> 02:09:49.657
- But?
- The Narrows is lost.

1371
02:09:50.199 --> 02:09:54.037
And we still haven't picked up Crane or
half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1372
02:09:54.746 --> 02:09:56.372
We will.

1373
02:09:56.581 --> 02:09:58.207
We can bring Gotham back.

1374
02:09:58.416 --> 02:10:00.877
- What about escalation?
- Escalation?

1375
02:10:01.085 --> 02:10:05.381
We start carrying semiautomatics,
they buy automatics.

1376
02:10:05.590 --> 02:10:09.886
We start wearing Kevlar,
they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1377
02:10:10.094 --> 02:10:13.348
- And?
- And you're wearing a mask...

1378
02:10:13.806 --> 02:10:15.683
...and jumping off rooftops.

1379
02:10:17.101 --> 02:10:19.103
Now, take this guy.

1380
02:10:19.395 --> 02:10:21.397
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1381
02:10:21.606 --> 02:10:24.859
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1382
02:10:25.109 --> 02:10:27.028
Leaves a calling card.

1383
02:10:32.950 --> 02:10:34.744
I'll look into it.

1384
02:10:38.247 --> 02:10:39.707
I never said thank you.

1385
02:10:44.796 --> 02:10:46.839
And you'll never have to.
