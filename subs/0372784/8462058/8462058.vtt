1
00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:51.468
Rachel, let me see.

2
00:00:57.558 --> 00:01:00.686
-Can I see?
-Finders keepers. And I found it.

3
00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:02.396
In my garden.

4
00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:05.941
Finders keepers.

5
00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.408
Bruce?

6
00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:21.123
Bruce?

7
00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:25.919
Mom! Mr. Alfred!

8
00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:51.028
Did you have dream?

9
00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:53.363
Nightmare.

10
00:01:57.743 --> 00:01:59.202
Worse than this place?

11
00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:23.185
They are going to fight you.

12
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.187
-Again?
-Until they kill you.

13
00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:29.191
Can they kill me before breakfast?

14
00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:34.404
You are in hell, little man.

15
00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.494
And I am the devil.

16
00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:45.332
You're not the devil.

17
00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:46.875
You're practice.

18
00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:31.628
Solitary.

19
00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:33.714
-Why?
-For protection.

20
00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:36.758
-I don't need protection.
-Protection for them.

21
00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:42.431
Get in.

22
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:48.645
Are you so
desperate to fight criminals...

23
00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:51.314
...that you lock yourself in
to take them on one at a time?

24
00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:56.445
Actually, there were seven of them.

25
00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.905
I counted six, Mr. Wayne.

26
00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:03.910
How do you know my name?

27
00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:07.164
The world is too small for someone
like Bruce Wayne to disappear...

28
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.624
...no matter how deep
he chooses to sink.

29
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:10.959
Who are you?

30
00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:14.296
My name is merely Ducard,
but I speak for Ra's al Ghul...

31
00:04:14.463 --> 00:04:18.091
...a man greatly feared
by the criminal underworld.

32
00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:19.843
A man who can offer you a path.

33
00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:23.263
What makes you think I need a path?

34
00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:26.266
Someone like you
is only here by choice.

35
00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:28.810
You have been exploring
the criminal fraternity...

36
00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:31.438
...but whatever
your original intentions...

37
00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:35.484
...you have become truly lost.

38
00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:40.822
And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?

39
00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:44.993
The path of a man
who shares his hatred of evil...

40
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.371
...and wishes to serve true justice.

41
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.957
The path of the League of Shadows.

42
00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:56.338
-You're vigilantes.
-No, no, no.

43
00:04:56.505 --> 00:05:00.675
A vigilante is just a man lost in
the scramble for his own gratification.

44
00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:04.513
He can be destroyed or locked up.

45
00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:10.685
But if you make yourself more
than just a man...

46
00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:13.855
...if you devote yourself to an ideal...

47
00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:16.525
...and if they can't stop you...

48
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.361
...then you become
something else entirely.

49
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.572
Which is?

50
00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:26.034
Legend, Mr. Wayne.

51
00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:28.995
Tomorrow, you will be released.

52
00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:32.582
If you are bored of brawling with thieves
and want to achieve something...

53
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:36.211
...there is a rare blue flower
that grows on the eastern slopes.

54
00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:38.046
Pick one of these flowers.

55
00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:41.174
If you can carry it
to the top of the mountain...

56
00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:44.261
...you may find what you were
looking for in the first place.

57
00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:47.180
And what was I looking for?

58
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.851
Only you can know that.

59
00:06:57.542 --> 00:07:01.630
You turn back. You go back.

60
00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:11.241
Ra's al Ghul?

61
00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:23.044
Wait.

62
00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.549
What are you seeking?

63
00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:30.260
Iseeku.

64
00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:34.055
...the means to fight injustice.

65
00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:36.558
To turn fear...

66
00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:39.728
...against those
who prey on the fearful.

67
00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:04.502
To manipulate the fears in others...

68
00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:08.757
...you must first master your own.

69
00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:11.092
Are you ready to begin?

70
00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.596
I can... I can barely stand.

71
00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:17.098
Death does not wait
for you to be ready!

72
00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:20.435
Death is not considerate or fair!

73
00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:25.565
And make no mistake,
here you face death.

74
00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:30.779
Tiger.

75
00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.199
Jujitsu.

76
00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:37.452
Panther.

77
00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:43.291
You're skilled. But this is not a dance.

78
00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:50.298
And you are afraid.

79
00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:55.136
But not of me.

80
00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:01.101
Tell us, Mr. Wayne...

81
00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:08.775
...what do you fear?

82
00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:19.327
Bruce?

83
00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:24.499
It's okay. It's okay.

84
00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:26.167
You'll be okay.

85
00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:28.837
Will we be needing
an ambulance, Master Wayne?

86
00:10:29.003 --> 00:10:31.881
No, I'll set the bone
and take him for an x-ray later.

87
00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:33.299
Very good, sir.

88
00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:37.470
-I'm very sorry, sir. I've told...
-Don't worry. It's fine.

89
00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:42.058
Took quite a fall,
didn't we, Master Bruce?

90
00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:43.393
And why do we fall?

91
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.646
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

92
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.278
Just a little fall.
It's just a small fracture.

93
00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:04.080
The bats again?

94
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.377
You know why they attacked you,
don't you?

95
00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:12.922
-They were afraid of you.
-Afraid of me?

96
00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:15.091
All creatures feel fear.

97
00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:16.593
Even the scary ones?

98
00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:18.595
Especially the scary ones.

99
00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:20.763
I got something to show you.

100
00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:28.438
-You think your mother will like them?
-Yeah.

101
00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:31.274
-I think it's time to get up.
-Maybe.

102
00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:33.067
No going back to bed.

103
00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:38.406
Did you build this train, Dad?

104
00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:43.286
Gotham's been good to our family,
but the city's been suffering.

105
00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:46.956
People less fortunate than us
have been enduring very hard times.

106
00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:51.085
So we built a new, cheap, public
transportation system to unite the city.

107
00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:52.962
And at the center...

108
00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:54.964
...Wayne Tower.

109
00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:57.967
-Is that where you work?
-No, I work at the hospital.

110
00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:01.387
I leave the running of our company
to much better men.

111
00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.431
-Better?
-Well...

112
00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:05.808
...more interested men.

113
00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:03.658
Can we go?

114
00:13:06.035 --> 00:13:07.537
Please.

115
00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:10.164
Okay. Let's go.

116
00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:22.218
-What's wrong, Bruce?
-No, no. It was me.

117
00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:24.554
I just needed some fresh air.

118
00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:27.890
A little bit of opera goes a long way.
Right, Bruce?

119
00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:33.229
Come on. Let's go.

120
00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:40.403
Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast.

121
00:13:40.611 --> 00:13:42.071
-That's fine.
-Fast.

122
00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:43.740
Take it easy.

123
00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:45.908
Take it easy.

124
00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:48.202
Here you go.

125
00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:53.750
It's fine. It's fine.

126
00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:57.754
Now just take it and go.

127
00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.255
-I said, jewelry.
-Hey...

128
00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:03.134
Thomas!

129
00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:12.769
Bruce.

130
00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:16.773
It's okay.

131
00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:21.652
Don't be afraid.

132
00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:55.269
Is this your father's?

133
00:14:56.813 --> 00:14:58.940
It's okay.

134
00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:01.776
Come here.

135
00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:06.697
There you go.

136
00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:11.828
It's okay.

137
00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:15.498
It's okay.

138
00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:21.003
Gordon.

139
00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:30.680
Hey.

140
00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:32.515
Good news.

141
00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.852
We got him, son.

142
00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:58.374
You're in excellent hands.

143
00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:00.209
We'll be watching the empire.

144
00:16:00.376 --> 00:16:03.379
When you grow up,
it'll be waiting for you.

145
00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:22.523
I thought I might prepare a little supper.

146
00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:29.780
-Very well.
-Alfred?

147
00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:35.745
-Yes, Master Bruce?
-It was my fault, Alfred.

148
00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:37.580
-I made them leave the theater.
-No.

149
00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:40.791
-If I hadn't gotten scared...
-It was nothing that you did.

150
00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:45.254
It was him, and him alone.

151
00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.256
Do you understand?

152
00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:53.429
I miss them, Alfred.
I miss them so much.

153
00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:55.598
So do I, Master Bruce.

154
00:16:58.017 --> 00:16:59.268
So do I.

155
00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:04.398
And do you still feel
responsible for your parents' death?

156
00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:06.609
My anger outweighs my guilt.

157
00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:08.778
Come.

158
00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:16.118
You have learned to bury
your guilt with anger.

159
00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:19.372
I will teach you to confront it
and to face the truth.

160
00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:26.837
You know how to fight six men.
We can teach you how to engage 600.

161
00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:29.966
You know how to disappear.

162
00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:32.343
We can teach you
to become truly invisible.

163
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.638
Invisible?

164
00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:44.313
The ninja understands that invisibility
is a matter of patience and agility.

165
00:17:57.285 --> 00:17:58.995
Always mind your surroundings.

166
00:18:02.164 --> 00:18:04.375
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.

167
00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:08.129
-As weapons?
-Or distractions.

168
00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:10.631
Theatricality and deception
are powerful agents.

169
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.135
You must become more than just a man
in the mind of your opponent.

170
00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:18.514
-Who is he?
-He was a farmer.

171
00:18:18.681 --> 00:18:21.976
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land
and became a murderer.

172
00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:24.437
-Now he is a prisoner.
-What'll happen to him?

173
00:18:24.604 --> 00:18:27.023
Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.

174
00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:31.152
Criminals thrive on the indulgence
of society's understanding.

175
00:18:35.197 --> 00:18:38.034
Your parents' death was not your fault.

176
00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:47.585
It was your father's.

177
00:19:08.522 --> 00:19:11.359
Anger does not change the fact
that your father failed to act.

178
00:19:11.525 --> 00:19:13.736
-The man had a gun.
-Would that stop you?

179
00:19:14.528 --> 00:19:15.738
I've had training.

180
00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:17.740
The training is nothing!

181
00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:19.575
Will is everything!

182
00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:27.208
The will to act.

183
00:19:36.967 --> 00:19:38.219
Yield.

184
00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:39.929
You haven't beaten me.

185
00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:42.765
You have sacrificed sure footing
for a killing stroke.

186
00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:52.233
Rub your chest.

187
00:19:52.733 --> 00:19:55.611
Your arms will take care of themselves.

188
00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.907
You are stronger than your father.

189
00:20:00.574 --> 00:20:02.201
You didn't know my father.

190
00:20:02.368 --> 00:20:04.620
But I know the rage that drives you.

191
00:20:04.787 --> 00:20:07.123
That impossible anger
strangling the grief...

192
00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:09.959
...until the memory
of your loved one is just...

193
00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:12.128
...poison in your veins.

194
00:20:12.294 --> 00:20:16.757
And one day, you catch yourself wishing
the person you loved had never existed...

195
00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:20.636
...so you'd be spared your pain.

196
00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:27.017
I wasn't always here in the mountains.

197
00:20:28.644 --> 00:20:30.646
Once, I had a wife.

198
00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:33.566
My great love.

199
00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:36.819
She was taken from me.

200
00:20:37.027 --> 00:20:40.239
Like you, I was forced to learn
there are those without decency...

201
00:20:40.406 --> 00:20:43.659
...who must be fought
without hesitation, without pity.

202
00:20:45.494 --> 00:20:47.830
Your anger gives you great power.

203
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.834
But if you let it, it will destroy you...

204
00:20:52.418 --> 00:20:53.669
...as it almost did me.

205
00:20:54.336 --> 00:20:57.298
-What stopped it?
-Vengeance.

206
00:20:57.506 --> 00:20:59.341
That's no help to me.

207
00:20:59.508 --> 00:21:01.343
Why, Bruce?

208
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:04.180
Why could you not
avenge your parents?

209
00:21:08.017 --> 00:21:11.479
Will you be heading back to Princeton
after the hearing, sir...

210
00:21:11.645 --> 00:21:14.315
...or can I persuade you to stay on
for a day or two?

211
00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:16.692
I'm not heading back at all.

212
00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:18.944
-You don't like it there?
-I like it fine.

213
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.114
They just don't feel the same way.

214
00:21:22.865 --> 00:21:26.535
-I've prepared the master bedroom.
-No.

215
00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:28.162
My room will be fine.

216
00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:31.040
With all due respect, sir,
Wayne Manor is your house.

217
00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:33.042
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

218
00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:35.377
-Your father is dead.
-This place is a mausoleum.

219
00:21:35.586 --> 00:21:38.631
If I have my way, I'll pull
the damn thing down brick by brick.

220
00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:42.885
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered
six generations of your family.

221
00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:45.721
Why do you give a damn, Alfred?
It's not your family.

222
00:21:46.597 --> 00:21:50.476
I give a damn because a good man
once made me responsible...

223
00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:53.312
...for what was most precious to him...

224
00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:55.731
...in the whole world.

225
00:21:57.691 --> 00:22:01.237
Miss Dawes has offered
to drive you to the hearing.

226
00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:03.405
She probably hopes
to talk you out of going.

227
00:22:03.614 --> 00:22:07.076
Should I just bury the past
out there with my parents, Alfred?

228
00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:10.329
I wouldn't presume to tell you
what to do with your past, sir.

229
00:22:10.496 --> 00:22:14.542
Just know that there are those of us who
care about what you do with your future.

230
00:22:15.918 --> 00:22:17.419
Haven't given up on me yet?

231
00:22:18.087 --> 00:22:19.588
Never.

232
00:23:08.137 --> 00:23:12.016
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk
on the top shelf.

233
00:23:12.182 --> 00:23:14.310
Hasn't he noticed
you're tall enough to reach now?

234
00:23:14.643 --> 00:23:16.145
Old habits die hard, I guess.

235
00:23:16.312 --> 00:23:18.772
-Never used to stop us anyway.
-No, it didn't.

236
00:23:18.939 --> 00:23:20.816
How's your mom?

237
00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:23.485
She misses this place.

238
00:23:24.987 --> 00:23:26.488
So do I.

239
00:23:26.906 --> 00:23:28.157
Yeah.

240
00:23:28.324 --> 00:23:31.327
But it's nothing without the people
who made it what it was.

241
00:23:31.493 --> 00:23:34.496
-Now there's only Alfred.
-And you.

242
00:23:34.663 --> 00:23:38.208
-I'm not staying, Rachel.
-You're just back for the hearing.

243
00:23:41.837 --> 00:23:46.008
Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way
to convince you not to come.

244
00:23:46.342 --> 00:23:49.845
Someone at this proceeding...

245
00:23:50.512 --> 00:23:52.681
...should stand for my parents.

246
00:23:52.848 --> 00:23:54.975
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

247
00:23:55.142 --> 00:23:58.354
-What Chill did is unforgivable.
-Then why is your boss letting him go?

248
00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:02.983
In prison, he shared a cell
with Carmine Falcone.

249
00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:06.820
He learned things, and he will testify
in exchange for early parole.

250
00:24:06.987 --> 00:24:09.657
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

251
00:24:11.659 --> 00:24:13.369
I cannot let that pass.

252
00:24:13.535 --> 00:24:16.372
And I need you
to understand that, please.

253
00:24:18.165 --> 00:24:19.375
Okay.

254
00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:23.796
The depression hit working
people, like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.

255
00:24:23.963 --> 00:24:27.174
His crime was appalling, yes,
but it was motivated not by greed...

256
00:24:27.508 --> 00:24:29.176
...but by desperation.

257
00:24:29.343 --> 00:24:33.222
Given the 14 years served, as well as
his extraordinary level of cooperation...

258
00:24:33.389 --> 00:24:36.058
...with one of this office's
most important investigations...

259
00:24:36.225 --> 00:24:39.353
...we strongly endorse his petition
for early release.

260
00:24:40.354 --> 00:24:42.648
Mr. Chill?

261
00:24:46.235 --> 00:24:47.903
Your Honor...

262
00:24:48.779 --> 00:24:51.907
...not a day goes by that I don't wish
I could take back what I did.

263
00:24:54.535 --> 00:24:57.746
Sure, I was desperate,
like a lot of people back then...

264
00:24:57.913 --> 00:25:00.290
...but that don't change what I did.

265
00:25:03.919 --> 00:25:08.590
I gather there is a member
of the Wayne family here today.

266
00:25:08.757 --> 00:25:11.051
Has he got anything to say?

267
00:25:25.107 --> 00:25:28.610
-He's coming out the side!
-He's coming out the side, guys!

268
00:25:38.287 --> 00:25:39.580
Bruce Wayne!

269
00:25:42.416 --> 00:25:43.625
Joe! Hey, Joe!

270
00:25:43.792 --> 00:25:44.793
Falcone says hi.

271
00:25:55.637 --> 00:25:57.222
Come on, Bruce.

272
00:25:57.598 --> 00:25:59.224
We don't need to see this.

273
00:25:59.975 --> 00:26:01.477
I do.

274
00:26:06.648 --> 00:26:09.068
The DA couldn't understand
why Judge Faden insisted...

275
00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:10.652
...on making the hearing public.

276
00:26:10.861 --> 00:26:13.238
Falcone paid him off
to get Chill out in the open.

277
00:26:13.447 --> 00:26:14.656
Maybe I should thank them.

278
00:26:14.865 --> 00:26:17.451
-You don't mean that.
-What if I do, Rachel?

279
00:26:17.618 --> 00:26:19.495
My parents deserved justice.

280
00:26:19.661 --> 00:26:22.623
You're not talking about justice.
You're talking about revenge.

281
00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:25.667
-Sometimes, they're the same.
-No, they're never the same.

282
00:26:25.834 --> 00:26:29.421
Justice is about harmony. Revenge is
about you making yourself feel better.

283
00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:32.883
-It's why we have an impartial system.
-Your system is broken.

284
00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:42.810
You care about justice?
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

285
00:26:43.185 --> 00:26:44.686
This city is rotting.

286
00:26:44.853 --> 00:26:47.648
They talk about the depression
as if it's history. It's not.

287
00:26:47.815 --> 00:26:49.316
Things are worse than ever here.

288
00:26:49.483 --> 00:26:52.027
Falcone floods our streets
with crime and drugs...

289
00:26:52.194 --> 00:26:55.155
...preying on the desperate,
creating new Joe Chills every day.

290
00:26:55.322 --> 00:26:57.866
Falcone may not have killed
your parents, Bruce...

291
00:26:58.492 --> 00:27:00.994
...but he's destroying everything
that they stood for.

292
00:27:05.541 --> 00:27:08.418
You wanna thank him for that?
Here you go.

293
00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:13.340
We all know where to find him.
As long as he keeps the bad people rich...

294
00:27:13.507 --> 00:27:15.634
...and the good people scared,
no one'll touch him.

295
00:27:15.801 --> 00:27:20.055
Good people like your parents, who'll
stand against injustice, they're gone.

296
00:27:20.222 --> 00:27:23.934
What chance does Gotham have
when the good people do nothing?

297
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:28.230
-I'm not one of your good people, Rachel.
-What do you mean?

298
00:27:30.482 --> 00:27:33.527
All these years, I wanted to kill him.

299
00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:35.904
Now I can't.

300
00:27:51.753 --> 00:27:53.463
Your father would be ashamed of you.

301
00:28:36.965 --> 00:28:39.468
You're taller than you look
in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

302
00:28:39.927 --> 00:28:41.803
No gun? I'm insulted.

303
00:28:44.973 --> 00:28:48.769
-You could've just sent a thank-you note.
-I didn't come here to thank you.

304
00:28:48.936 --> 00:28:51.647
I came to show you that
not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.

305
00:28:51.813 --> 00:28:53.482
Only those who know me, kid.

306
00:28:53.815 --> 00:28:56.318
Look around you.
You'll see two councilmen...

307
00:28:56.652 --> 00:28:59.488
...a union official,
couple off-duty cops...

308
00:28:59.905 --> 00:29:01.490
...and a judge.

309
00:29:01.657 --> 00:29:05.994
I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of
blowing your head off in front of them.

310
00:29:06.161 --> 00:29:08.830
Now, that's power you can't buy.

311
00:29:09.498 --> 00:29:10.958
That's the power of fear.

312
00:29:11.333 --> 00:29:12.626
I'm not afraid of you.

313
00:29:12.793 --> 00:29:14.670
Because you think you got
nothing to lose.

314
00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:16.505
But you haven't thought it through.

315
00:29:16.672 --> 00:29:19.800
You haven't thought about
your lady friend in the DA's office.

316
00:29:19.967 --> 00:29:23.011
You haven't thought about
your old butler. Bang!

317
00:29:26.515 --> 00:29:28.850
People from your world...

318
00:29:29.017 --> 00:29:31.353
...have so much to lose.

319
00:29:31.561 --> 00:29:35.857
Now, you think because your mommy
and your daddy got shot...

320
00:29:36.066 --> 00:29:39.027
...you know about the ugly side of life,
but you don't.

321
00:29:39.194 --> 00:29:41.321
You've never tasted desperate.

322
00:29:41.488 --> 00:29:44.032
You're... You're Bruce Wayne,
the prince of Gotham.

323
00:29:44.199 --> 00:29:47.619
You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet
someone who didn't know your name.

324
00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:52.040
So don't come here with your anger,
trying to prove something to yourself.

325
00:29:52.207 --> 00:29:54.376
This is a world you'll never understand.

326
00:29:54.543 --> 00:29:56.545
And you always fear...

327
00:29:56.712 --> 00:29:59.172
...what you don't understand.

328
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.385
All right.

329
00:30:11.059 --> 00:30:13.895
Yeah, you got spirit, kid.
I'll give you that.

330
00:30:14.062 --> 00:30:16.064
More than your old man anyway.

331
00:30:16.231 --> 00:30:20.527
In the joint, Chill told me about
the night he killed your parents.

332
00:30:20.694 --> 00:30:22.904
He said your father begged for mercy.

333
00:30:24.239 --> 00:30:26.033
Begged.

334
00:30:26.199 --> 00:30:27.576
Like a dog.

335
00:30:40.422 --> 00:30:42.215
Should've tipped better.

336
00:30:52.225 --> 00:30:54.061
-For what?
-Your jacket.

337
00:30:54.603 --> 00:30:56.229
Okay.

338
00:30:57.272 --> 00:31:00.776
Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it.
It's a nice coat.

339
00:31:00.942 --> 00:31:03.070
Be careful who sees you with that.

340
00:31:03.653 --> 00:31:05.572
-They're gonna come looking for me.
-Who?

341
00:31:06.031 --> 00:31:07.741
Everyone.

342
00:31:10.035 --> 00:31:11.787
It's...

343
00:31:11.953 --> 00:31:13.955
It's a nice coat.

344
00:31:32.265 --> 00:31:36.645
<i>When you lived among
the criminals, did you start to pity them?</i>

345
00:31:36.812 --> 00:31:40.482
<i>The first time I stole
so that I wouldn't starve, yes.</i>

346
00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:46.154
<i>I lost many assumptions about
the simple nature of right and wrong.</i>

347
00:31:47.447 --> 00:31:49.491
<i>And when I traveled...</i>

348
00:31:49.699 --> 00:31:52.411
<i>...l learned the fear before a crime...</i>

349
00:31:53.161 --> 00:31:55.747
<i>...and the thrill of success.</i>

350
00:31:57.624 --> 00:31:59.501
<i>But I never became one of them.</i>

351
00:32:02.337 --> 00:32:05.465
Fool. What do I care
what your name is? You're a criminal.

352
00:32:07.667 --> 00:32:09.636
Tell that to the guy who owned these.

353
00:32:11.721 --> 00:32:14.850
<i>You've traveled the world
to understand the criminal mind...</i>

354
00:32:15.016 --> 00:32:16.309
...and conquer your fears.

355
00:32:18.353 --> 00:32:22.524
But a criminal is not complicated.

356
00:32:22.691 --> 00:32:26.027
And what you really fear
is inside yourself.

357
00:32:26.194 --> 00:32:28.697
You fear your own power.

358
00:32:28.864 --> 00:32:30.198
You fear your anger...

359
00:32:30.657 --> 00:32:34.870
...the drive to do great
or terrible things.

360
00:32:35.036 --> 00:32:38.540
Now you must journey inwards.

361
00:32:42.294 --> 00:32:44.379
You are ready.

362
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.798
Breathe.

363
00:32:56.349 --> 00:32:58.226
Breathe.

364
00:33:03.231 --> 00:33:05.066
Breathe in your fears.

365
00:33:07.694 --> 00:33:08.737
Face them.

366
00:33:10.238 --> 00:33:13.033
To conquer fear,
you must become fear.

367
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.578
You must bask in the fear
of other men.

368
00:33:18.038 --> 00:33:21.416
And men fear most
what they cannot see.

369
00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:41.561
You have to become a terrible thought.

370
00:33:46.066 --> 00:33:47.275
A wraith.

371
00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:55.408
You have to become an idea!

372
00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:05.335
Feel terror cloud your senses.

373
00:34:07.087 --> 00:34:10.298
Feel its power to distort.

374
00:34:11.258 --> 00:34:13.468
To control.

375
00:34:16.555 --> 00:34:20.350
And know that this power
can be yours.

376
00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:35.574
Embrace your worst fear.

377
00:34:42.581 --> 00:34:44.874
Become one with the darkness.

378
00:35:04.686 --> 00:35:06.396
Focus.

379
00:35:06.688 --> 00:35:08.857
Concentrate.

380
00:35:09.024 --> 00:35:11.151
Master your senses.

381
00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:41.681
You cannot leave any sign.

382
00:35:42.057 --> 00:35:43.224
I haven't.

383
00:35:51.566 --> 00:35:53.568
Impressive.

384
00:36:02.661 --> 00:36:04.746
We have purged your fear.

385
00:36:05.914 --> 00:36:07.540
You are ready to lead these men.

386
00:36:07.707 --> 00:36:11.252
You are ready to become a member
of the League of Shadows.

387
00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:18.051
But first, you must demonstrate
your commitment to justice.

388
00:36:34.776 --> 00:36:36.111
No.

389
00:36:37.612 --> 00:36:38.905
I'm no executioner.

390
00:36:39.447 --> 00:36:43.118
Your compassion is
a weakness your enemies will not share.

391
00:36:43.493 --> 00:36:45.787
That's why it's so important.

392
00:36:46.037 --> 00:36:47.789
It separates us from them.

393
00:36:47.956 --> 00:36:50.291
You want to fight criminals.
This man is a murderer.

394
00:36:50.458 --> 00:36:52.377
-This man should be tried.
-By whom?

395
00:36:52.585 --> 00:36:54.129
Corrupt bureaucrats?

396
00:36:54.295 --> 00:36:56.798
Criminals mock society's laws.

397
00:36:57.006 --> 00:36:59.300
You know this better than most.

398
00:37:00.135 --> 00:37:02.804
You cannot lead these men...

399
00:37:02.971 --> 00:37:06.975
...unless you are prepared to do
what is necessary to defeat evil.

400
00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:09.978
And where would I be leading
these men?

401
00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:11.813
Gotham.

402
00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:13.982
As Gotham's favored son...

403
00:37:14.149 --> 00:37:18.528
...you will be ideally placed
to strike at the heart of criminality.

404
00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:22.657
-How?
-Gotham's time has come.

405
00:37:22.824 --> 00:37:26.161
Like Constantinople or Rome before it...

406
00:37:26.327 --> 00:37:30.498
...the city has become a breeding ground
for suffering and injustice.

407
00:37:30.665 --> 00:37:34.335
It is beyond saving
and must be allowed to die.

408
00:37:34.502 --> 00:37:39.674
This is the most important function
of the League of Shadows.

409
00:37:39.966 --> 00:37:43.052
It is one we've performed for centuries.

410
00:37:43.344 --> 00:37:45.138
Gotham...

411
00:37:45.305 --> 00:37:48.183
...must be destroyed.

412
00:37:51.519 --> 00:37:53.021
You can't believe in this.

413
00:37:53.188 --> 00:37:57.776
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from
the darkest corners of our own hearts.

414
00:37:57.942 --> 00:38:02.363
What he asks in return is the courage
to do what is necessary.

415
00:38:02.572 --> 00:38:05.867
I will go back to Gotham
and I will fight men like this...

416
00:38:06.075 --> 00:38:08.661
...but I will not become an executioner.

417
00:38:08.828 --> 00:38:10.371
Bruce, please.

418
00:38:10.538 --> 00:38:13.374
For your own sake,
there is no turning back.

419
00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:48.243
-What are you doing?
-What's necessary, my friend.

420
00:41:04.712 --> 00:41:07.840
I will tell him you saved his life.

421
00:41:26.567 --> 00:41:29.070
Master Wayne,
you've been gone a long time.

422
00:41:29.278 --> 00:41:31.572
-Yes, I have.
-You look very fashionable.

423
00:41:33.074 --> 00:41:34.575
Apart from the mud.

424
00:41:34.826 --> 00:41:37.495
Are you coming back to Gotham
for long, sir?

425
00:41:37.662 --> 00:41:38.913
As long as it takes.

426
00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.581
I want to show the people...

427
00:41:40.748 --> 00:41:44.168
...their city doesn't belong
to the criminals and the corrupt.

428
00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:47.547
In the depression, your father nearly
bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...

429
00:41:47.714 --> 00:41:48.923
...combating poverty.

430
00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:53.594
He believed his example could inspire
the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.

431
00:41:53.928 --> 00:41:55.555
Did it?

432
00:41:56.681 --> 00:41:58.099
In a way.

433
00:41:58.307 --> 00:42:01.394
Their murder shocked the wealthy
and the powerful into action.

434
00:42:03.396 --> 00:42:06.441
People need dramatic examples
to shake them out of apathy.

435
00:42:06.607 --> 00:42:08.276
I can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

436
00:42:08.443 --> 00:42:09.944
Asa man...

437
00:42:10.111 --> 00:42:12.572
...I'm flesh and blood,
I can be ignored, destroyed.

438
00:42:12.739 --> 00:42:14.615
But as a symbol...

439
00:42:16.117 --> 00:42:18.786
As a symbol, I can be incorruptible.

440
00:42:18.953 --> 00:42:21.581
-I can be everlasting.
-What symbol?

441
00:42:22.123 --> 00:42:24.792
Something elemental...

442
00:42:24.959 --> 00:42:26.627
...something terrifying.

443
00:42:26.794 --> 00:42:28.921
I assume that as you take on
the underworld...

444
00:42:29.088 --> 00:42:34.218
...this symbol is a persona to protect
those you care about from reprisals?

445
00:42:34.385 --> 00:42:35.762
You're thinking about Rachel?

446
00:42:35.928 --> 00:42:38.306
Actually, sir, I was thinking of myself.

447
00:42:40.308 --> 00:42:42.060
Have you told anyone I'm coming back?

448
00:42:42.268 --> 00:42:46.481
I couldn't figure the legal ramifications
of bringing you back from the dead.

449
00:42:46.647 --> 00:42:48.483
-Dead?
-You've been gone seven years.

450
00:42:48.649 --> 00:42:49.984
You had me declared dead?

451
00:42:50.151 --> 00:42:52.987
Actually, it was Mr. Earle.
He's taking the company public.

452
00:42:53.154 --> 00:42:55.448
He wanted to liquidate
your majority shareholding.

453
00:42:55.656 --> 00:42:57.992
Those shares are worth
quite a bit of money.

454
00:42:58.159 --> 00:43:00.870
Well, it's a good thing
I left everything to you, then.

455
00:43:01.412 --> 00:43:02.997
Quite so, sir.

456
00:43:03.164 --> 00:43:06.959
And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like.
Just bring it back with a full tank.

457
00:43:17.011 --> 00:43:21.682
In my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much
a danger to himself as to others...

458
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:26.687
...and prison is probably not the best
environment for his rehabilitation.

459
00:43:28.981 --> 00:43:31.526
-Dr. Crane.
-Miss Dawes.

460
00:43:31.692 --> 00:43:35.029
You think a man who butchers people
for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

461
00:43:35.196 --> 00:43:37.865
I would hardly have testified to that
otherwise, would I?

462
00:43:38.032 --> 00:43:41.119
This is the third of Falcone's thugs
you've had declared insane...

463
00:43:41.285 --> 00:43:42.703
...and moved into your asylum.

464
00:43:42.912 --> 00:43:47.542
The work offered by organized crime
must have an attraction to the insane.

465
00:43:49.043 --> 00:43:51.045
Or the corrupt.

466
00:43:53.339 --> 00:43:54.924
Mr. Finch.

467
00:43:55.216 --> 00:43:57.051
You should check
with Miss Dawes here...

468
00:43:57.218 --> 00:44:01.556
...just what implications your office
has authorized her to make. If any.

469
00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.895
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing, Carl?

470
00:44:08.062 --> 00:44:09.438
Looking out for you.

471
00:44:11.941 --> 00:44:14.861
Falcone has half the city
bought and paid for.

472
00:44:15.027 --> 00:44:17.071
-Drop it.
-How can you say that?

473
00:44:17.238 --> 00:44:20.908
Because as much as I care about
getting Falcone, I care more about you.

474
00:44:21.075 --> 00:44:22.410
That's sweet.

475
00:44:27.832 --> 00:44:30.209
We've been through all that.

476
00:44:56.277 --> 00:44:57.737
Blessed bat again, sir.

477
00:44:58.196 --> 00:45:00.615
They nest somewhere in the grounds.

478
00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:01.193
No more favors.
Someone is sniffing around.

479
00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:04.322
Hey, I scratch your back,
you scratch mine, doc.

480
00:47:04.488 --> 00:47:05.865
I'm bringing in the shipments.

481
00:47:06.574 --> 00:47:07.742
We are paying you for that.

482
00:47:07.908 --> 00:47:10.411
Maybe money isn't as interesting
to me as favors.

483
00:47:12.913 --> 00:47:17.752
I am more than aware that you are
not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

484
00:47:17.918 --> 00:47:21.005
But you know who I'm working for,
and when he gets here...

485
00:47:21.172 --> 00:47:23.090
He... He's coming to Gotham?

486
00:47:23.257 --> 00:47:24.717
Yes, he is.

487
00:47:24.884 --> 00:47:27.345
And when he gets here,
he's not going to wanna hear...

488
00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:32.600
...that you've endangered our operation
just to get your thugs out of jail time.

489
00:47:33.601 --> 00:47:36.937
-Who's bothering you?
-There's a girl at the DA's office.

490
00:47:37.438 --> 00:47:39.231
-We'll buy her off.
-Not this one.

491
00:47:40.358 --> 00:47:42.276
Idealist, huh?

492
00:47:42.443 --> 00:47:44.153
Well, there's an answer to that too.

493
00:47:44.528 --> 00:47:47.448
-I don't want to know.
-Yes, you do.

494
00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:55.122
No, we are showing
very healthy growth in these sectors.

495
00:47:55.289 --> 00:47:58.459
I don't think Thomas Wayne would have
viewed heavy-arms manufacture...

496
00:47:58.626 --> 00:48:00.795
...as a suitable cornerstone
for our business.

497
00:48:02.171 --> 00:48:05.966
Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.

498
00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:09.470
I think after 20 years
we can allow ourselves...

499
00:48:09.637 --> 00:48:12.473
...to stop thinking about what
Thomas Wayne would have done.

500
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.475
Good morning, Mr. Earle's office.

501
00:48:14.683 --> 00:48:17.978
Yes, he's confirmed for
the dinner tomorrow evening.

502
00:48:18.145 --> 00:48:21.482
Good morning.
I'm here to see Mr. Earle.

503
00:48:21.649 --> 00:48:23.150
Name?

504
00:48:23.609 --> 00:48:25.277
Bruce Wayne.

505
00:48:27.154 --> 00:48:30.658
Thomas would probably not
have taken the company public.

506
00:48:30.825 --> 00:48:34.912
But that is what we,
as responsible managers, are going to do.

507
00:48:35.621 --> 00:48:37.164
Jessica?

508
00:48:38.249 --> 00:48:40.793
Jessica? Where are you?

509
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:45.214
-Eye on the ball, and...
-Why is no one answering the phone?

510
00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:49.009
It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle.
I'm sure they'll call back.

511
00:48:49.343 --> 00:48:51.846
Bruce? You're supposed to be dead.

512
00:48:52.012 --> 00:48:54.014
I'm sorry to disappoint.

513
00:48:54.181 --> 00:48:56.851
-I need you to take a look at this.
-Have you seen him yet?

514
00:48:57.184 --> 00:48:58.727
-Who?
-Wayne.

515
00:48:59.019 --> 00:49:01.147
It's been all over the news.
He's back.

516
00:49:05.025 --> 00:49:07.987
I'm sure you realize
I can't stop the big machine.

517
00:49:08.154 --> 00:49:09.363
Too many wheels turning.

518
00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:11.532
-We're going public.
-I understand.

519
00:49:12.032 --> 00:49:14.869
And I'll be handsomely rewarded
for my shares.

520
00:49:15.035 --> 00:49:17.538
I'm not looking to interfere.

521
00:49:18.038 --> 00:49:20.166
-I am looking for a job.
-Oh?

522
00:49:20.332 --> 00:49:23.377
I just want to get to know the company
that my family built.

523
00:49:23.711 --> 00:49:25.463
Any ideas where you would start?

524
00:49:25.963 --> 00:49:28.340
Applied Sciences caught my eye.

525
00:49:28.716 --> 00:49:30.384
Fox's department.

526
00:49:30.551 --> 00:49:32.553
I'll let him know you're coming.

527
00:49:33.512 --> 00:49:36.265
You look like him. Your dad.

528
00:49:37.057 --> 00:49:39.727
You're the only one left
of the Wayne family.

529
00:49:39.894 --> 00:49:43.856
This is where you belong.
Welcome home.

530
00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:48.694
Environmental procedures,
defense projects, consumer products.

531
00:49:49.195 --> 00:49:51.906
All prototypes. None in production.

532
00:49:52.072 --> 00:49:54.742
-On any level whatsoever.
-None?

533
00:49:55.743 --> 00:49:57.578
What did they tell you this place was?

534
00:49:57.745 --> 00:49:59.788
They didn't tell me anything.

535
00:50:02.249 --> 00:50:05.711
Earle told me exactly what it was
when he sent me down here.

536
00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:07.588
Dead end.

537
00:50:07.796 --> 00:50:11.091
Place to keep me from causing
the board any more trouble.

538
00:50:12.092 --> 00:50:13.594
Come on.

539
00:50:13.761 --> 00:50:16.222
-You were on the board?
-When your father ran things.

540
00:50:16.388 --> 00:50:18.265
-You knew my father?
-Oh, yeah.

541
00:50:18.432 --> 00:50:20.100
Helped him build his train.

542
00:50:20.684 --> 00:50:22.311
Here we are.

543
00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:27.608
Kevlar utility harness.

544
00:50:27.942 --> 00:50:29.944
Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun.

545
00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:32.446
The 350-pound test monofilament.

546
00:50:35.783 --> 00:50:37.952
Wonderful project, your dad's train.

547
00:50:38.452 --> 00:50:43.082
Routed it right into Wayne Tower,
along with the water and power utilities.

548
00:50:43.249 --> 00:50:46.460
Kind of made Wayne Tower
the unofficial center of Gotham City.

549
00:50:46.627 --> 00:50:49.296
Of course, Earle let it go to rot.
Here we are.

550
00:50:51.131 --> 00:50:53.300
Nomex survival suit
for advanced infantry.

551
00:50:53.467 --> 00:50:56.262
Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.

552
00:50:56.595 --> 00:50:58.973
-Tear-resistant?
-This sucker will stop a knife.

553
00:50:59.139 --> 00:51:01.308
-Bulletproof?
-Anything but a straight shot.

554
00:51:01.475 --> 00:51:04.395
-Why didn't they put it into production?
-Bean counters didn't think...

555
00:51:04.562 --> 00:51:06.939
...a soldier's life was worth 300 grand.

556
00:51:07.982 --> 00:51:11.485
So, what's your interest in it,
Mr. Wayne?

557
00:51:12.152 --> 00:51:13.654
I want to borrow it.

558
00:51:13.821 --> 00:51:15.614
For spelunking.

559
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:17.783
Spelunking?

560
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:19.660
Yeah, you know, cave diving?

561
00:51:20.953 --> 00:51:23.622
You expecting to run into
much gunfire in these caves?

562
00:51:25.958 --> 00:51:29.169
Look, I'd rather Mr. Earle
didn't know about me borrowing...

563
00:51:29.378 --> 00:51:30.629
Mr. Wayne...

564
00:51:30.838 --> 00:51:32.756
...the way I see it...

565
00:51:33.173 --> 00:51:35.676
...all this stuff is yours anyway.

566
00:51:38.637 --> 00:51:41.140
Okay. Give it a try.

567
00:51:45.269 --> 00:51:46.520
Charming.

568
00:51:49.356 --> 00:51:51.150
At least you'll have company.

569
00:51:53.027 --> 00:51:57.031
This must be the lowest foundation
of the southeast wing.

570
00:52:09.501 --> 00:52:13.672
Your great-great-grandfather was
involved in the Underground Railroad...

571
00:52:13.839 --> 00:52:16.842
...secretly transporting freed slaves
to the North...

572
00:52:17.009 --> 00:52:20.721
...and I suspect these caverns
came in handy.

573
00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:35.569
Alfred! Come up here!

574
00:52:35.736 --> 00:52:38.739
I can see everything all right
from down here, sir, thank you.

575
00:52:58.759 --> 00:53:01.428
We order the main part
of this cowl from Singapore.

576
00:53:01.595 --> 00:53:03.097
Via a dummy corporation.

577
00:53:03.263 --> 00:53:05.099
Indeed. And then, quite separately...

578
00:53:05.265 --> 00:53:10.229
...we place an order
to a Chinese company for these.

579
00:53:10.771 --> 00:53:13.732
-Put it together ourselves.
-Precisely.

580
00:53:13.899 --> 00:53:17.945
They'll have to be large orders,
to avoid suspicion.

581
00:53:18.112 --> 00:53:20.614
-How large?
-Say 10,000.

582
00:53:23.117 --> 00:53:26.078
-Well, at least we'll have spares.
-Yes.

583
00:53:43.137 --> 00:53:45.264
Don't suppose you want a taste.

584
00:53:45.431 --> 00:53:48.600
I just keep offering,
thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.

585
00:53:48.767 --> 00:53:50.936
There's nothing wise
in what you do, Flass.

586
00:53:51.103 --> 00:53:54.481
Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste,
makes us guys nervous.

587
00:53:54.648 --> 00:53:56.483
I'm no rat.

588
00:53:59.236 --> 00:54:02.948
In a town this bent,
who's thereto rat to anyway?

589
00:54:32.644 --> 00:54:34.772
Don't turn around.

590
00:54:35.355 --> 00:54:38.442
You're a good cop.
One of the few.

591
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:40.194
What do you want?

592
00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:43.530
Carmine Falcone brings
in shipments of drugs every week.

593
00:54:43.697 --> 00:54:45.532
Nobody takes him down. Why?

594
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:49.077
He's paid up with the right people.

595
00:54:49.369 --> 00:54:52.164
What will it take to bring him down?

596
00:54:52.873 --> 00:54:55.292
Leverage on Judge Faden...

597
00:54:56.001 --> 00:54:58.378
...and a DA brave enough
to prosecute.

598
00:54:58.796 --> 00:55:00.380
Rachel Dawes.

599
00:55:01.006 --> 00:55:02.090
Who are you?

600
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:04.176
Watch for my sign.

601
00:55:06.845 --> 00:55:08.889
You're just one man?

602
00:55:09.306 --> 00:55:10.724
Now we're two.

603
00:55:12.851 --> 00:55:14.394
We?

604
00:55:30.077 --> 00:55:31.829
Freeze!

605
00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:50.931
What the hell was that?

606
00:55:53.851 --> 00:55:55.060
Just some nut.

607
00:55:58.438 --> 00:56:01.275
Well, what is it today?
More spelunking?

608
00:56:01.441 --> 00:56:03.944
No. Today it's BASE-jumping.

609
00:56:04.528 --> 00:56:06.154
BASE-jumping.

610
00:56:06.738 --> 00:56:09.283
-That like parachuting?
-Kind of.

611
00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:13.287
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

612
00:56:13.453 --> 00:56:16.123
You know, I think I have just the thing.

613
00:56:17.457 --> 00:56:19.918
It's called memory cloth.
Notice anything?

614
00:56:23.255 --> 00:56:25.132
Regularly flexible...

615
00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:27.676
...but put a current through it...

616
00:56:29.136 --> 00:56:32.806
-...molecules realign, it becomes rigid.
-What kind of shapes can you make?

617
00:56:32.973 --> 00:56:36.143
Can be tailored to fit any structure
based on a rigid skeleton.

618
00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:37.477
Too expensive for the Army?

619
00:56:37.686 --> 00:56:42.441
I don't think they tried to market it
to the billionaire, BASE-jumping crowd.

620
00:56:42.608 --> 00:56:44.401
-Look, Mr. Fox.
-Yes, sir?

621
00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:46.445
If you're uncomfortable...

622
00:56:46.612 --> 00:56:49.823
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me
exactly what you're doing...

623
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:51.950
...when I'm asked, I don't have to lie.

624
00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:56.288
But don't think of me as an idiot.

625
00:56:57.789 --> 00:56:59.750
Fair enough.

626
00:57:01.668 --> 00:57:03.503
What's that?

627
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:07.507
The Tumbler?

628
00:57:08.008 --> 00:57:09.968
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.

629
00:57:15.974 --> 00:57:17.851
She was built as a bridging vehicle.

630
00:57:19.853 --> 00:57:24.316
During combat, two of these
would jump over a river, towing cables.

631
00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:30.489
Over here on the throttle,
flip that open and throttle up.

632
00:57:30.697 --> 00:57:33.241
This will boost you into a rampless jump...
Not now!

633
00:57:36.036 --> 00:57:38.205
Not... Not now, sir.

634
00:57:41.041 --> 00:57:42.876
<i>Afterburner disengaged.</i>

635
00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:46.338
We never could get
the damn bridge to work...

636
00:57:46.505 --> 00:57:48.215
...but this baby works just fine.

637
00:57:57.766 --> 00:57:59.017
So, what do you think?

638
00:58:00.268 --> 00:58:02.270
Does it come in black?

639
00:58:02.896 --> 00:58:05.273
I need you at the docks Thursday.

640
00:58:05.524 --> 00:58:07.401
-Problems?
-I don't want any trouble...

641
00:58:07.567 --> 00:58:09.695
-...with the last shipment.
-Sure.

642
00:58:11.279 --> 00:58:14.908
Word on the street is you got a beef
with somebody in the DA's office.

643
00:58:15.075 --> 00:58:17.536
-Is that right?
-And that there's a fat prize...

644
00:58:17.703 --> 00:58:20.414
...waiting for anybody willing
to do anything about it.

645
00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:22.541
So, what's your point, Mr. Flass?

646
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.251
Have you seen the girl?

647
00:58:24.751 --> 00:58:27.421
<i>It's a cute little assistant DA.</i>

648
00:58:27.587 --> 00:58:31.258
<i>Don't you think that's a little too much
heat to bring down, maybe?</i>

649
00:58:31.425 --> 00:58:34.761
-Even for this town.
-Never underestimate Gotham City.

650
00:58:34.928 --> 00:58:37.764
People get mugged coming home
from work every day of the week.

651
00:58:37.931 --> 00:58:40.559
Sometimes...
Sometimes things just go bad.

652
00:58:44.438 --> 00:58:46.231
It's a problem with the graphite, sir.

653
00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:49.109
The next 10,000
will be up to specifications.

654
00:58:49.276 --> 00:58:51.862
-At least they gave us a discount.
-Quite.

655
00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:57.617
In the meantime, sir, may I suggest
you try to avoid landing on your head?

656
00:59:34.654 --> 00:59:36.656
Why bats, Master Wayne?

657
00:59:36.948 --> 00:59:38.158
Bats frighten me.

658
00:59:39.493 --> 00:59:41.787
It's time my enemies shared my dread.

659
01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.398
What is this?

660
01:00:14.194 --> 01:00:15.529
Continue.

661
01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:22.702
Looks fine out there.

662
01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.038
The bears go straight to the dealers.

663
01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:27.874
Yeah, and the rabbits go
to the man in the Narrows.

664
01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:31.044
-What's the difference?
-Ignorance is bliss, my friend.

665
01:00:31.211 --> 01:00:34.381
Don't burden yourself
with the secrets of scary people.

666
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:53.233
Hey. Steiss.

667
01:01:14.546 --> 01:01:16.006
Stems'?

668
01:01:27.934 --> 01:01:29.561
What?

669
01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:31.771
What the...?

670
01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.616
I better check it.

671
01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:57.130
There's a problem out here.
You better bail.

672
01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:27.827
Where are you?!

673
01:02:27.994 --> 01:02:28.995
Here.

674
01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:53.687
Take a ride. Oh, shit.

675
01:03:11.871 --> 01:03:13.623
What the hell are you?

676
01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:18.211
I'm Batman.

677
01:03:26.553 --> 01:03:28.513
Nice coat.

678
01:03:30.223 --> 01:03:31.725
Thanks.

679
01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:14.059
Hold it.

680
01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:18.646
That's right, you better run.

681
01:04:27.614 --> 01:04:29.449
Falcone sent them to kill you.

682
01:04:30.575 --> 01:04:33.161
-Why?
-You rattled his cage.

683
01:04:36.956 --> 01:04:38.458
-What's this?
-Leverage.

684
01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:40.293
-For what?
-To get things moving.

685
01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:42.587
Who are you?

686
01:04:42.962 --> 01:04:44.214
Someone like you.

687
01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:46.424
Someone who'll rattle the cages.

688
01:04:51.471 --> 01:04:54.974
Ma'am? Everything okay?

689
01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:01.815
-Falcone's men?
-Does it matter?

690
01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:04.275
We'll never tie him to it anyway.

691
01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:06.611
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

692
01:05:19.666 --> 01:05:21.501
What the hell is that?

693
01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:32.345
Cut him down.

694
01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:56.202
Unacceptable.

695
01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:59.205
Now, I don't care if it's rival gangs,
Guardian Angels...

696
01:05:59.372 --> 01:06:01.332
...or the goddamn Salvation Army...

697
01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:03.877
...get them off the street
and off the front page.

698
01:06:04.043 --> 01:06:06.671
They say it was just one guy.
Or a creature.

699
01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:09.549
It was some asshole in a costume.

700
01:06:10.049 --> 01:06:11.718
-Yeah?
-This guy did deliver us...

701
01:06:11.885 --> 01:06:14.679
...one of the city's biggest crime lords.

702
01:06:14.846 --> 01:06:18.349
No one takes the law
into their own hands in my city.

703
01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:19.726
Understand?

704
01:06:19.893 --> 01:06:22.729
-No way to bury it now.
-There's still Judge Faden.

705
01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:25.857
-I've got Faden covered.
-What about this bat they babble about?

706
01:06:26.024 --> 01:06:29.027
Even if these guys will swear
to being thrashed by a giant bat...

707
01:06:29.194 --> 01:06:31.362
...we've got Falcone at the scene.

708
01:06:31.529 --> 01:06:34.741
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests.
This bat character gave us everything.

709
01:06:35.158 --> 01:06:36.701
Okay. Let's do it.

710
01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:42.248
-Bats are nocturnal.
-Bats may be.

711
01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:45.835
But even for billionaire playboys,
3:00 is pushing it.

712
01:06:46.878 --> 01:06:49.756
The price for leading a double life,
I fear.

713
01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:53.510
Your theatrics made an impression.

714
01:06:54.886 --> 01:06:57.931
Theatricality and deception...

715
01:06:58.097 --> 01:07:01.267
...are powerful weapons, Alfred.
This is a good start.

716
01:07:01.434 --> 01:07:04.270
If those are to be the first
of many injuries to come...

717
01:07:04.437 --> 01:07:07.273
...it would be wise
to find a suitable excuse.

718
01:07:07.607 --> 01:07:08.942
Polo, for instance.

719
01:07:09.108 --> 01:07:10.777
I'm not learning polo, Alfred.

720
01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:14.697
Strange injuries,
a nonexistent social life.

721
01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:16.282
These things beg the question...

722
01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:20.745
...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne
do with his time and his money.

723
01:07:20.912 --> 01:07:22.455
What does someone like me do?

724
01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:27.627
Drive sports cars, date movie stars.

725
01:07:28.336 --> 01:07:29.921
Buy things that are not for sale.

726
01:07:30.088 --> 01:07:33.633
Who knows, Master Wayne,
you start pretending to have fun...

727
01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:36.261
...you might even have a little
by accident.

728
01:07:38.972 --> 01:07:40.431
Sir.

729
01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:42.934
-We have a situation.
-All right.

730
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:47.146
The Coast Guard picked up
one of our cargo ships last night...

731
01:07:47.647 --> 01:07:52.485
...heavily damaged, all crew missing,
probably dead.

732
01:07:54.487 --> 01:07:56.906
<i>The ship was carrying
a prototype weapon.</i>

733
01:07:57.115 --> 01:07:58.908
<i>It's a microwave emitter.</i>

734
01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:01.995
It's designed for desert warfare, but it...

735
01:08:03.663 --> 01:08:05.290
It looks like somebody...

736
01:08:09.669 --> 01:08:11.170
...turned it on.

737
01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:19.804
It uses focused microwaves to
vaporize the enemy's water supply.

738
01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:30.690
<i>The damage to the ship
was catastrophic.</i>

739
01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:33.860
The weapon itself is...

740
01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:36.654
Missing?

741
01:08:37.488 --> 01:08:38.698
Yeah.

742
01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:41.993
Mr. Wayne.

743
01:08:45.705 --> 01:08:47.165
Nice car.

744
01:08:47.332 --> 01:08:48.708
You should see my other one.

745
01:08:58.509 --> 01:09:00.678
He's done something
the police never have.

746
01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:03.139
You can't take the law
into your own hands.

747
01:09:03.306 --> 01:09:05.892
Well, at least he's getting
something done.

748
01:09:06.059 --> 01:09:08.394
-Bruce, help me out here.
-Huh?

749
01:09:08.561 --> 01:09:12.899
Well, a guy who dresses up
like a bat clearly has issues.

750
01:09:13.941 --> 01:09:16.152
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

751
01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:18.696
Now the cops want him.
What does that tell you?

752
01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:20.073
They're jealous.

753
01:09:20.239 --> 01:09:22.909
Sir, the pool is for decoration...

754
01:09:23.076 --> 01:09:26.454
...and your friends
do not have swimwear.

755
01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:30.249
Well, they're European.

756
01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:34.462
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

757
01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:38.841
-It is not a question of money.
-Well, you see...

758
01:09:39.425 --> 01:09:41.219
...I'm buying this hotel...

759
01:09:43.012 --> 01:09:47.433
...and setting some new rules
about the pool area.

760
01:09:48.601 --> 01:09:50.937
I think the Batman deserves a medal.

761
01:09:51.104 --> 01:09:53.272
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

762
01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:01.364
Thank you.

763
01:10:03.116 --> 01:10:04.450
Bruce?

764
01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:09.789
Rachel?

765
01:10:09.997 --> 01:10:11.416
I'd heard you were back.

766
01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:14.961
What are you doing?

767
01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:20.133
Just swimming here.
Wow, it is good to see you.

768
01:10:20.299 --> 01:10:21.801
You were gone a long time.

769
01:10:22.427 --> 01:10:25.304
-I know. How are things?
-The same.

770
01:10:27.265 --> 01:10:28.933
Job's getting worse.

771
01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:31.811
Can't change the world on your own.

772
01:10:31.978 --> 01:10:34.063
What choice do I have...

773
01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:36.482
...when you're too busy swimming?

774
01:10:37.817 --> 01:10:39.819
Rachel, all of...

775
01:10:40.153 --> 01:10:41.821
All this...

776
01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:47.285
It's... It's not me. It's...

777
01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:50.329
Inside, I am...

778
01:10:51.539 --> 01:10:53.499
I am more.

779
01:10:54.167 --> 01:10:55.668
Come on, Bruce. Come on.

780
01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:59.672
Bruce, we have
some more hotels for you to buy.

781
01:11:00.673 --> 01:11:02.175
Bruce...

782
01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:06.846
...deep down you may still be
that same great kid you used to be.

783
01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:11.851
But it's not who you are underneath...

784
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:14.061
...it's what you do that defines you.

785
01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:28.201
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.

786
01:11:28.367 --> 01:11:31.204
Not at all. He cut his wrists?

787
01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:35.041
Probably looking for the insanity plea.
But if anything should happen...

788
01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:38.211
Of course, better safe than sorry.

789
01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:45.218
Yeah, Dr. Crane, I can't take it anymore.
It's all too much.

790
01:11:45.384 --> 01:11:47.845
The walls are closing in.
Blah, blah, blah.

791
01:11:48.387 --> 01:11:50.890
A couple of days of this food,
it'll be true.

792
01:11:51.891 --> 01:11:53.559
-What do you want?
-I wanna know...

793
01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:56.229
...how you're gonna convince me
to keep my mouth shut.

794
01:11:56.395 --> 01:11:58.564
About what?
You don't know anything.

795
01:11:58.731 --> 01:12:02.902
I know you don't want the cops to take
a closer look at the drugs they seized.

796
01:12:03.069 --> 01:12:07.240
And I know about your experiments
with the inmates of your nut house.

797
01:12:07.406 --> 01:12:11.077
See, I don't go into business with a guy
without finding out his dirty secrets.

798
01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:14.580
And those goons you used.

799
01:12:14.747 --> 01:12:16.582
I own the muscle in this town.

800
01:12:16.749 --> 01:12:20.127
Now, I've been bringing
your stuff in for months...

801
01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:24.882
...so whatever he's planning,
it's big, and I want in.

802
01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:29.262
Well, I already know what he'll say.

803
01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.097
That we should kill you.

804
01:12:32.932 --> 01:12:36.269
Even he can't get me in here.
Not in my town.

805
01:12:42.233 --> 01:12:43.776
Would you like to see my mask?

806
01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:46.779
I use it in my experiments.

807
01:12:49.282 --> 01:12:53.744
Now, I'm probably not very frightening
to a guy like you.

808
01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:56.956
But these crazies, they can't stand it.

809
01:12:57.748 --> 01:12:59.792
So when did the nut
take over the nut house?

810
01:13:01.919 --> 01:13:03.880
They scream and they cry...

811
01:13:04.463 --> 01:13:06.090
...much as you're doing now.

812
01:13:08.426 --> 01:13:11.637
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.

813
01:13:11.804 --> 01:13:14.307
I'll talk to the judge
and see if I can get him moved...

814
01:13:14.473 --> 01:13:17.935
...to the secure wing at Arkham.
I can't treat him here.

815
01:13:39.957 --> 01:13:41.459
Storm's coming.

816
01:13:46.005 --> 01:13:49.008
The scum is getting jumpy
because you stood up to Falcone.

817
01:13:49.216 --> 01:13:52.762
It's a start. Your partner
was at the docks with Falcone.

818
01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:55.640
Well, he moonlights
as a low-level enforcer.

819
01:13:56.015 --> 01:13:59.810
They were splitting the shipment in two.
Only half went to the dealers.

820
01:13:59.977 --> 01:14:01.854
Why? What about the other half?

821
01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:04.774
-Flass knows.
-He won't talk.

822
01:14:05.358 --> 01:14:06.984
He'll talk to me.

823
01:14:07.151 --> 01:14:10.196
Commissioner Loeb set up
a massive task force to catch you.

824
01:14:10.655 --> 01:14:13.199
-He thinks you're dangerous.
-What do you think?

825
01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:17.370
I think you're trying to help.

826
01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:24.710
But I've been wrong before.

827
01:14:30.508 --> 01:14:32.218
Come on, I ain't got all night.

828
01:14:35.554 --> 01:14:37.390
Flass, I have kids to feed.

829
01:14:37.848 --> 01:14:40.017
What, they don't like falafel?

830
01:14:55.408 --> 01:14:57.076
Where were the other drugs going?

831
01:14:58.411 --> 01:15:00.579
I never knew. I don't know.

832
01:15:00.746 --> 01:15:02.915
-I swear to God.
-Swear to me!

833
01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:11.590
I don't... I don't know.
I never knew. Never.

834
01:15:11.882 --> 01:15:15.302
They went to some guy for a couple days
before they went to the dealers.

835
01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:16.804
Why?

836
01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:21.058
There was something...
Something else in the drugs...

837
01:15:21.225 --> 01:15:22.768
-...something hidden.
-What?

838
01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:26.272
I never went to the drop-off point.
It was in the Narrows.

839
01:15:26.439 --> 01:15:29.775
-Cops only go there in force.
-Do I look like a cop?

840
01:15:29.942 --> 01:15:31.736
No...!

841
01:15:45.332 --> 01:15:47.376
This is the one I'm talking about.

842
01:15:47.626 --> 01:15:49.962
-What's your problem with it?
-It shouldn't exist.

843
01:15:50.129 --> 01:15:53.966
This ship left Singapore with
246 containers, but arrived with 247.

844
01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:56.693
I'm guessing there's something
I'm not supposed to find in there.

845
01:15:56.719 --> 01:16:00.097
Listen, counselor, we don't wanna
know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.

846
01:16:00.264 --> 01:16:03.601
Things are working a little
differently now. Open it up.

847
01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:14.153
What the hell is this?

848
01:16:57.029 --> 01:17:00.199
It's you, isn't it?
Everybody's been talking about you.

849
01:17:00.783 --> 01:17:02.535
Get in here!

850
01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.287
The other kids won't believe me.

851
01:17:28.394 --> 01:17:30.521
Get rid of all traces.

852
01:17:30.813 --> 01:17:33.732
-Better torch the whole place.
-All right.

853
01:18:09.768 --> 01:18:11.562
Having trouble?

854
01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:14.607
Take a seat. Have a drink.

855
01:18:15.274 --> 01:18:18.569
You look like a man
who takes himself too seriously.

856
01:18:22.281 --> 01:18:25.284
Do you want my opinion?
You need to lighten up.

857
01:19:17.253 --> 01:19:20.965
Alfred, help me.

858
01:19:30.849 --> 01:19:34.186
Blood. Take. Take poison. Blood poison.

859
01:19:34.353 --> 01:19:37.356
Poisonous. Poisonous.

860
01:19:41.694 --> 01:19:43.362
<i>Bruce...</i>

861
01:19:44.697 --> 01:19:45.864
<i>...why do we fall?</i>

862
01:19:57.876 --> 01:20:01.213
-How long was I out?
-Two days.

863
01:20:01.588 --> 01:20:03.465
It's your birthday.

864
01:20:04.717 --> 01:20:06.051
Many happy returns.

865
01:20:11.223 --> 01:20:15.060
I've felt these effects before,
but this was so much more potent.

866
01:20:15.227 --> 01:20:19.815
It was some kind of hallucinogen,
weaponized, in aerosol form.

867
01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:22.901
You have been hanging out
in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

868
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:26.196
I called Mr. Fox when your condition
worsened after the first day.

869
01:20:26.363 --> 01:20:27.740
I analyzed your blood...

870
01:20:27.906 --> 01:20:31.410
...isolating the receptor compounds
and the protein-based catalyst.

871
01:20:31.577 --> 01:20:33.370
Am I meant to understand any of that?

872
01:20:33.746 --> 01:20:36.915
Not at all. I just wanted you to know
how hard it was.

873
01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:41.211
-Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote.
-Could you make more?

874
01:20:41.378 --> 01:20:43.922
You planning on gassing yourself
again, Mr. Wayne?

875
01:20:44.131 --> 01:20:47.343
Well, you know how it is.
You're out at night, looking for kicks...

876
01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:50.262
...someone's passing around
the weaponized hallucinogens...

877
01:20:50.429 --> 01:20:53.891
I'll bring what I have.
The antidote should inoculate you for now.

878
01:20:54.058 --> 01:20:56.435
Alfred, always a pleasure.

879
01:20:56.602 --> 01:20:58.270
Lucius.

880
01:21:02.775 --> 01:21:05.444
-You sure you don't want to come in?
-I have to get back.

881
01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:07.279
-I wanted to leave this.
-Thank you.

882
01:21:07.446 --> 01:21:08.864
Rachel?

883
01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:13.452
Looks like someone's been
burning the candle at both ends.

884
01:21:13.619 --> 01:21:16.288
-Must've been quite an occasion.
-It is my birthday.

885
01:21:16.455 --> 01:21:20.125
I know. I'm sorry I can't come tonight.
I was just dropping off your present.

886
01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:23.712
-You've got better plans?
-My boss has been missing for days...

887
01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:26.215
...which means I should
probably start by looking...

888
01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:28.133
-...at the bottom of the river.
-Rachel.

889
01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:30.677
Excuse me.

890
01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:33.472
Rachel Dawes.

891
01:21:34.056 --> 01:21:37.643
Who authorized that? Get Crane down
there now. Don't take no for an answer.

892
01:21:37.810 --> 01:21:41.730
Call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our
own assessment to the judge by morning.

893
01:21:42.147 --> 01:21:43.982
-What's wrong?
-It's Falcone.

894
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:46.652
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum
on suicide watch.

895
01:21:46.819 --> 01:21:49.822
You're going to Arkham now?
It's in the Narrows, Rachel.

896
01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:52.908
You enjoy your party, Bruce.

897
01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:55.828
-Some of us have work to do.
-You be careful.

898
01:21:57.579 --> 01:21:59.164
Happy birthday.

899
01:22:18.517 --> 01:22:20.686
But, Master Wayne,
the guests will be arriving.

900
01:22:20.853 --> 01:22:22.479
Keep them happy until I arrive.

901
01:22:22.646 --> 01:22:24.857
Tell them that joke you know.

902
01:23:03.687 --> 01:23:05.397
Having fun?

903
01:23:07.524 --> 01:23:11.069
Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you
doing in a place like this?

904
01:23:11.278 --> 01:23:12.571
I need some information.

905
01:23:12.738 --> 01:23:17.534
The Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1-ME.

906
01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:20.329
1-ME.

907
01:23:20.496 --> 01:23:24.249
It's a microwave emitter. It was designed
to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

908
01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:28.587
Rumor was they tested dispersing
water-based chemicals into the air...

909
01:23:28.795 --> 01:23:30.756
...but isn't that illegal?

910
01:23:32.424 --> 01:23:36.720
I want all the information
on the development of this project...

911
01:23:36.887 --> 01:23:40.891
...all data, files, backup disks,
on my desk right away.

912
01:23:41.266 --> 01:23:42.935
Did you lose one?

913
01:23:43.936 --> 01:23:47.606
I'm merging your department
with Archives.

914
01:23:48.815 --> 01:23:50.108
And I am firing you.

915
01:23:52.236 --> 01:23:54.238
Didn't you get the memo?

916
01:24:01.453 --> 01:24:03.121
Scarecrow.

917
01:24:06.416 --> 01:24:08.293
Scarecrow.

918
01:24:11.630 --> 01:24:12.965
Scarecrow.

919
01:24:15.968 --> 01:24:18.136
Miss Dawes, this is most irregular.

920
01:24:18.345 --> 01:24:21.265
I have nothing to add
to the report I filed with the judge.

921
01:24:21.431 --> 01:24:23.642
-I have questions about your report.
-Such as?

922
01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:28.146
Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man
who has no history of mental illness...

923
01:24:28.313 --> 01:24:31.942
...to have a psychotic breakdown
just when he's about to be indicted?

924
01:24:32.109 --> 01:24:36.363
As you can see for yourself, there is
nothing convenient about his symptoms.

925
01:24:40.993 --> 01:24:42.411
-Scarecrow.
-What's "scarecrow"?

926
01:24:42.869 --> 01:24:46.498
Patients suffering delusional episodes
often focus their paranoia...

927
01:24:46.665 --> 01:24:48.792
...on an external tormentor...

928
01:24:48.959 --> 01:24:52.170
...usually one conforming
to Jungian archetypes.

929
01:24:52.379 --> 01:24:54.798
In this case, a scarecrow.

930
01:24:56.258 --> 01:25:00.345
-He's drugged?
-Psychopharmacology is my primary field.

931
01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:02.472
<i>I'm a strong advocate.</i>

932
01:25:02.848 --> 01:25:05.017
<i>Outside, he was a giant.</i>

933
01:25:05.183 --> 01:25:07.686
In here, only the mind
can grant you power.

934
01:25:07.853 --> 01:25:09.605
You enjoy the reversal.

935
01:25:09.771 --> 01:25:12.774
I respect the mind's power
over the body.

936
01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:14.484
It's why I do what I do.

937
01:25:14.651 --> 01:25:19.531
I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone
behind bars, not in therapy.

938
01:25:19.698 --> 01:25:23.035
I want my own psychiatric consultant
to have full access to Falcone...

939
01:25:23.201 --> 01:25:26.538
...including blood work.
Find out what exactly you put him on.

940
01:25:26.705 --> 01:25:29.207
-First thing tomorrow, then.
-Tonight.

941
01:25:29.374 --> 01:25:32.836
I've already paged Dr. Lehmann
at County General.

942
01:25:34.212 --> 01:25:36.048
As you wish.

943
01:25:41.553 --> 01:25:43.513
This way, please.

944
01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:46.308
There's something
I think you should see.

945
01:25:57.194 --> 01:25:59.821
This is where we make the medicine.

946
01:26:06.578 --> 01:26:10.540
Perhaps you should have some,
clear your head.

947
01:26:35.774 --> 01:26:37.401
Who knows you're here?

948
01:26:38.443 --> 01:26:40.070
Who knows?

949
01:26:47.285 --> 01:26:48.537
He's here.

950
01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:49.955
Who?

951
01:26:50.122 --> 01:26:52.082
The Batman.

952
01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:55.794
-What do we do?
-What anyone does...

953
01:26:55.961 --> 01:26:58.755
...when a prowler comes around.

954
01:26:59.631 --> 01:27:02.259
-Call the police.
-You want the cops here?

955
01:27:02.801 --> 01:27:05.595
At this point, they can't stop us.

956
01:27:05.762 --> 01:27:09.307
But the Batman
has a talent for disruption.

957
01:27:09.474 --> 01:27:12.561
Force him outside,
the police will take him down. Go.

958
01:27:12.728 --> 01:27:14.980
-What about her?
-She hasn't got long.

959
01:27:15.147 --> 01:27:17.107
I gave her a concentrated dose.

960
01:27:17.274 --> 01:27:19.818
The mind can only take so much.
Now go.

961
01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:24.656
The things they say about him.

962
01:27:24.823 --> 01:27:26.324
Can he really fly?

963
01:27:26.533 --> 01:27:28.618
I heard he can disappear.

964
01:27:28.785 --> 01:27:31.830
Well, we'll find out.

965
01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:33.749
Won't we?

966
01:28:21.046 --> 01:28:23.215
Taste of your own medicine, doctor?

967
01:28:29.846 --> 01:28:31.723
What have you been doing here?

968
01:28:34.810 --> 01:28:37.229
Who are you working for?

969
01:28:41.650 --> 01:28:44.027
Ra's... Ra's al Ghul.

970
01:28:44.194 --> 01:28:49.074
Ra's al Ghul is dead.
Who are you working for?

971
01:28:49.241 --> 01:28:50.242
Crane.

972
01:28:52.744 --> 01:28:55.705
Dr. Crane isn't here right now.

973
01:28:56.248 --> 01:28:58.166
But if you'd like to make
an appointment...

974
01:29:11.179 --> 01:29:14.099
Batman, put down your
weapons and surrender.

975
01:29:14.766 --> 01:29:16.226
You're surrounded.

976
01:29:21.773 --> 01:29:24.568
-What are you waiting for?
-Backup.

977
01:29:25.277 --> 01:29:27.696
-Backup?
-The Batman's in there.

978
01:29:27.863 --> 01:29:30.031
SWAT's on the way.
But if you wanna go in now...

979
01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:31.741
...I'll be right behind you, sir.

980
01:29:33.243 --> 01:29:34.786
SWAT's on the way.

981
01:29:35.871 --> 01:29:37.163
-Hey.
-Hey.

982
01:30:19.664 --> 01:30:21.333
What's happened to her?

983
01:30:24.002 --> 01:30:27.839
Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic
hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin.

984
01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:33.595
-Let me get her down to the medics.
-They can't help her, but I can.

985
01:30:37.515 --> 01:30:39.684
Get her downstairs.
Meet me in the alley.

986
01:30:47.651 --> 01:30:50.528
Crane's been smuggling his toxin
hidden in Falcone's drugs...

987
01:30:50.695 --> 01:30:52.864
...and they're dumping it
into the water supply.

988
01:30:53.365 --> 01:30:55.033
-What was he planning?
-I don't know.

989
01:30:55.241 --> 01:30:56.534
Was he working for Falcone?

990
01:30:57.035 --> 01:30:59.537
He mentioned someone else,
someone worse.

991
01:30:59.746 --> 01:31:02.332
She needs the antidote
before the damage is permanent.

992
01:31:02.499 --> 01:31:04.709
-How long does she have?
-Not long.

993
01:31:08.546 --> 01:31:10.382
What is that?

994
01:31:11.758 --> 01:31:14.052
-Backup.
-What the...?

995
01:32:32.255 --> 01:32:33.798
Excuse me.

996
01:32:38.553 --> 01:32:41.806
-How is she?
-She's fading. We gotta go.

997
01:32:43.641 --> 01:32:45.101
I'll get my car.

998
01:32:45.268 --> 01:32:47.103
I brought mine.

999
01:32:47.479 --> 01:32:49.147
Yours?

1000
01:32:58.448 --> 01:33:00.283
I've gotta get me one of those.

1001
01:33:00.784 --> 01:33:02.118
He is in a vehicle.

1002
01:33:02.285 --> 01:33:03.787
<i>Make and color?</i>

1003
01:33:03.953 --> 01:33:06.164
It's a black...

1004
01:33:07.499 --> 01:33:08.833
...tank.

1005
01:33:11.461 --> 01:33:12.837
Stay calm.

1006
01:33:13.505 --> 01:33:15.298
You've been poisoned.

1007
01:33:18.009 --> 01:33:19.344
I'm on him.

1008
01:33:27.685 --> 01:33:28.812
Breathe slowly.

1009
01:33:38.905 --> 01:33:40.031
Hold on.

1010
01:33:54.504 --> 01:33:55.880
-What are you doing?
-Shortcut.

1011
01:34:03.972 --> 01:34:06.683
<i>Air One to ground, block that ramp.</i>

1012
01:34:10.728 --> 01:34:12.355
<i>He's got no way off that roof.</i>

1013
01:34:13.731 --> 01:34:16.860
Turn off your engine.
Step away from the car.

1014
01:34:18.795 --> 01:34:19.894
Trust me.

1015
01:34:19.919 --> 01:34:22.014
<i>Weapons system activated.</i>

1016
01:34:39.883 --> 01:34:40.925
Who is this guy?

1017
01:34:41.092 --> 01:34:42.594
<i>Where's he going?</i>

1018
01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:43.970
He's on the roof.

1019
01:34:57.609 --> 01:35:00.278
<i>-What street is he taking?</i>
-He's not on a street.

1020
01:35:00.445 --> 01:35:01.738
He's flying on rooftops.

1021
01:35:40.944 --> 01:35:43.154
At least tell me what it looks like.

1022
01:35:46.157 --> 01:35:47.659
Never mind.

1023
01:35:51.537 --> 01:35:52.914
Got him.

1024
01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:05.343
Coming right up on his butt.

1025
01:36:30.076 --> 01:36:33.288
<i>We're tracking suspect
vehicle heading Weston I-17.</i>

1026
01:36:37.792 --> 01:36:39.502
<i>-Air One to ground.</i>
-I lost him.

1027
01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:41.713
<i>We've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked.</i>

1028
01:36:41.879 --> 01:36:43.840
<i>We'll loop back to check
the frontage road.</i>

1029
01:36:44.007 --> 01:36:46.009
<i>Stealth mode activated.</i>

1030
01:36:46.634 --> 01:36:47.885
Stay with me.

1031
01:36:54.058 --> 01:36:55.560
What...? There he is.

1032
01:37:15.246 --> 01:37:16.706
Just hold on.

1033
01:37:20.668 --> 01:37:21.878
Rachel!

1034
01:37:53.951 --> 01:37:56.120
They get any of this into the mains?

1035
01:37:56.287 --> 01:37:57.288
Yeah.

1036
01:37:57.455 --> 01:38:00.291
Notify the water company.
There's gotta be a way to isolate it.

1037
01:38:00.458 --> 01:38:03.127
No. They put it all in.
They must've been at this for weeks.

1038
01:38:03.294 --> 01:38:06.798
-Gotham's entire water supply is laced.
-Why haven't we felt the effects?

1039
01:38:06.964 --> 01:38:09.364
Must be a compound that
has to be absorbed through the lungs.

1040
01:38:19.477 --> 01:38:21.229
How do you feel?

1041
01:38:23.981 --> 01:38:25.483
Where are we?

1042
01:38:25.983 --> 01:38:29.779
-Why did you bring me here?
-If I hadn't, your mind would be lost.

1043
01:38:29.946 --> 01:38:31.989
-You were poisoned.
-It was...

1044
01:38:32.156 --> 01:38:35.785
-It was Dr. Crane.
-Rest. Gordon has Crane.

1045
01:38:35.952 --> 01:38:38.079
Is Sergeant Gordon your friend?

1046
01:38:38.913 --> 01:38:40.581
I don't have the luxury of friends.

1047
01:38:41.457 --> 01:38:44.794
I'm gonna give you a sedative.
You'll wake up back at home.

1048
01:38:44.961 --> 01:38:48.923
When you do, get these to Gordon,
and Gordon alone. Trust no one.

1049
01:38:49.090 --> 01:38:50.842
-What are they?
-The antidote.

1050
01:38:51.008 --> 01:38:54.345
One for Gordon to inoculate himself,
the other for mass production.

1051
01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:56.013
Mass production?

1052
01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:59.350
Crane was just a pawn.
We need to be ready.

1053
01:39:25.293 --> 01:39:28.713
When you told me your grand plan
for saving Gotham...

1054
01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:31.799
...all that stopped me
from calling the men in white coats...

1055
01:39:31.966 --> 01:39:34.469
...was when you said
it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

1056
01:39:34.635 --> 01:39:37.680
-It's not.
-What would you call that?

1057
01:39:39.515 --> 01:39:42.226
-Damn good television.
-It's a miracle no one was killed.

1058
01:39:42.393 --> 01:39:46.063
I didn't have time to observe
the rules of the road, Alfred.

1059
01:39:46.230 --> 01:39:49.358
You're getting lost inside
this monster of yours.

1060
01:39:49.525 --> 01:39:53.905
I'm using this monster to help
other people, just like my father did.

1061
01:39:54.071 --> 01:39:55.698
For Thomas Wayne, helping others...

1062
01:39:55.865 --> 01:39:58.784
...wasn't about proving anything
to anyone, including himself.

1063
01:39:59.243 --> 01:40:02.580
It's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.

1064
01:40:03.039 --> 01:40:05.666
She's downstairs, sedated.
I need you to take her home.

1065
01:40:05.917 --> 01:40:09.587
Well, we both care for Rachel, but what
you're doing has to be beyond that.

1066
01:40:09.879 --> 01:40:12.757
It can't be personal,
or you're just a vigilante.

1067
01:40:12.924 --> 01:40:14.842
-Is Fox still here?
-Yes, sir.

1068
01:40:15.009 --> 01:40:16.636
We need to send these people away.

1069
01:40:16.844 --> 01:40:19.764
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests.
You have a name to maintain.

1070
01:40:19.931 --> 01:40:21.766
I don't care about my name.

1071
01:40:21.933 --> 01:40:25.102
It's not just your name, sir.
It's your father's name.

1072
01:40:26.896 --> 01:40:29.273
And it's all that's left of him.

1073
01:40:31.192 --> 01:40:32.777
Don't destroy it.

1074
01:40:48.084 --> 01:40:50.253
-Mr. Earle.
-Happy birthday, Bruce.

1075
01:40:50.419 --> 01:40:51.837
Thank you.

1076
01:40:52.129 --> 01:40:54.131
How did the stock offering go?

1077
01:40:54.423 --> 01:40:55.633
Prices soared.

1078
01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:57.051
Who was buying?

1079
01:40:57.218 --> 01:40:59.136
All kinds of funds and brokerages.

1080
01:40:59.303 --> 01:41:00.972
It's a bit technical.

1081
01:41:01.138 --> 01:41:02.890
The key thing is...

1082
01:41:03.057 --> 01:41:05.059
...our company's future is secure.

1083
01:41:06.894 --> 01:41:07.937
Great.

1084
01:41:21.659 --> 01:41:23.953
A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.

1085
01:41:29.667 --> 01:41:31.460
What was the plan, Crane?

1086
01:41:31.627 --> 01:41:33.879
How were you gonna get
your toxin into the air?

1087
01:41:34.255 --> 01:41:37.508
Scarecrow. Scarecrow.

1088
01:41:37.675 --> 01:41:39.510
Who were you working for, Crane?

1089
01:41:41.637 --> 01:41:43.848
Oh, it's too late.

1090
01:41:44.432 --> 01:41:46.517
You can't stop it now.

1091
01:41:51.606 --> 01:41:53.149
Here.

1092
01:41:53.316 --> 01:41:55.359
-Happy birthday, Bruce.
-Thank you. Thanks.

1093
01:41:55.526 --> 01:41:58.404
And thank you for that item.

1094
01:41:59.905 --> 01:42:01.157
You're welcome.

1095
01:42:01.324 --> 01:42:04.118
-I know you'll put it to good use.
-I already have.

1096
01:42:04.368 --> 01:42:08.205
How long would it take
to manufacture on a large scale?

1097
01:42:08.706 --> 01:42:09.874
Weeks. Why?

1098
01:42:10.041 --> 01:42:13.210
Somebody's planning to disperse
the toxin using the water supply.

1099
01:42:14.211 --> 01:42:17.298
The water supply won't help you
disperse an inhalant.

1100
01:42:18.215 --> 01:42:19.634
What?

1101
01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:22.345
Unless you have a microwave emitter
powerful enough...

1102
01:42:22.511 --> 01:42:25.389
...to vaporize all the water
in the mains.

1103
01:42:25.806 --> 01:42:29.060
A microwave emitter like the one
Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.

1104
01:42:29.518 --> 01:42:30.728
Misplaced?

1105
01:42:30.895 --> 01:42:34.398
Earle just fired me for asking
too many questions about it.

1106
01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:39.904
Go back to Wayne Enterprises now
and start making more of that antidote.

1107
01:42:40.071 --> 01:42:43.199
The police are gonna need as much
as they can get their hands on.

1108
01:42:43.366 --> 01:42:45.409
My security clearance
has been revoked.

1109
01:42:45.576 --> 01:42:47.578
That wouldn't stop a man like you,
would it?

1110
01:42:48.037 --> 01:42:49.747
I suppose not.

1111
01:42:51.749 --> 01:42:56.420
-Bruce, there's somebody you must meet.
-Not now, Mrs. Delane.

1112
01:42:56.587 --> 01:42:59.507
Now, am I pronouncing this right...

1113
01:42:59.674 --> 01:43:02.093
...Mr. Ra's al Ghul?

1114
01:43:07.765 --> 01:43:09.558
You're not Ra's al Ghul.

1115
01:43:11.102 --> 01:43:12.395
I watched him die.

1116
01:43:12.561 --> 01:43:15.606
But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?

1117
01:43:18.359 --> 01:43:20.778
Are his methods supernatural?

1118
01:43:25.366 --> 01:43:29.787
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal
your true identity, Ra's?

1119
01:43:31.622 --> 01:43:36.127
Surely a man who spends his nights
scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...

1120
01:43:36.293 --> 01:43:38.295
...wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.

1121
01:43:39.130 --> 01:43:40.965
I saved your life.

1122
01:43:41.132 --> 01:43:43.634
I warned you about compassion, Bruce.

1123
01:43:46.804 --> 01:43:49.014
Your quarrel is with me.

1124
01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:52.393
You let these people go.

1125
01:43:52.643 --> 01:43:55.938
You are welcome to explain
the situation to them.

1126
01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:59.817
Everyone.

1127
01:44:00.609 --> 01:44:02.486
Everybody?

1128
01:44:05.072 --> 01:44:06.949
I...

1129
01:44:07.408 --> 01:44:11.662
I want to thank you all for coming here
tonight and drinking all of my booze.

1130
01:44:13.748 --> 01:44:15.458
No, really.

1131
01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:19.253
There's a thing about being a Wayne...

1132
01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:23.007
...that you're never short of
a few freeloaders, like yourselves...

1133
01:44:23.174 --> 01:44:26.844
...to fill up your mansion with.
So here's to you people. Thank you.

1134
01:44:27.011 --> 01:44:29.638
-That's enough, Bruce.
-I'm not finished.

1135
01:44:29.972 --> 01:44:31.682
To all of you...

1136
01:44:31.849 --> 01:44:36.187
All of you phonies,
all of you two-faced friends...

1137
01:44:36.353 --> 01:44:41.484
...you sycophantic suck-ups
who smile through your teeth at me...

1138
01:44:41.650 --> 01:44:45.196
...please, leave me in peace.

1139
01:44:45.362 --> 01:44:48.032
Please go.

1140
01:44:48.365 --> 01:44:51.786
Stop smiling, it's not a joke.
Please leave.

1141
01:44:51.952 --> 01:44:54.163
The party's over, get out.

1142
01:44:54.330 --> 01:44:57.583
The apple has fallen very far
from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

1143
01:45:02.379 --> 01:45:04.715
He's turning into a jerk.

1144
01:45:11.013 --> 01:45:12.723
Amusing.

1145
01:45:13.057 --> 01:45:16.519
But pointless.
None of these people have long to live.

1146
01:45:16.685 --> 01:45:20.189
Your antics at the asylum
have forced my hand.

1147
01:45:20.356 --> 01:45:22.525
So Crane was working for you.

1148
01:45:22.691 --> 01:45:26.529
His toxin is derived from the organic
compound found in our blue flowers.

1149
01:45:26.862 --> 01:45:28.906
He was able to weaponize it.

1150
01:45:29.073 --> 01:45:31.075
He's not a member of
the League of Shadows?

1151
01:45:31.242 --> 01:45:35.746
Of course not. He thought our plan
was to hold the city to ransom.

1152
01:45:36.497 --> 01:45:41.043
But really, you are gonna release
Crane's poison on the entire city.

1153
01:45:41.210 --> 01:45:45.256
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart
through fear.

1154
01:45:57.893 --> 01:46:00.020
<i>You're gonna destroy millions of lives.</i>

1155
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:03.691
Only a cynical man would call
what these people have "lives," Wayne.

1156
01:46:03.858 --> 01:46:05.568
Crime. Despair.

1157
01:46:05.734 --> 01:46:07.778
This is not how man
was supposed to live.

1158
01:46:08.445 --> 01:46:11.615
The League of Shadows has been
a check against human corruption...

1159
01:46:11.782 --> 01:46:13.284
...for thousands of years.

1160
01:46:13.450 --> 01:46:17.037
We sacked Rome.
Loaded trade ships with plague rats.

1161
01:46:17.204 --> 01:46:18.622
Burned London to the ground.

1162
01:46:18.789 --> 01:46:21.625
Every time a civilization reaches
the pinnacle of its decadence...

1163
01:46:21.792 --> 01:46:23.752
...we return to restore the balance.

1164
01:46:23.919 --> 01:46:25.462
Gotham isn't beyond saving.

1165
01:46:26.797 --> 01:46:29.466
Give me more time.
There are good people here.

1166
01:46:29.675 --> 01:46:31.468
You're defending a city so corrupt...

1167
01:46:31.677 --> 01:46:34.805
...we have infiltrated
every level of its infrastructure.

1168
01:46:45.941 --> 01:46:47.318
Time to play.

1169
01:46:51.488 --> 01:46:54.158
When I found you in that jail,
you were lost.

1170
01:46:54.325 --> 01:46:56.452
But I believed in you.

1171
01:46:56.619 --> 01:47:00.331
I took away your fear,
and I showed you a path.

1172
01:47:00.623 --> 01:47:02.833
You were my greatest student.

1173
01:47:03.167 --> 01:47:06.337
It should be you standing by my side,
saving the world.

1174
01:47:07.129 --> 01:47:09.757
I'll be standing where I belong.

1175
01:47:10.341 --> 01:47:13.510
Between you
and the people of Gotham.

1176
01:47:15.179 --> 01:47:17.806
No one can save Gotham.

1177
01:47:21.143 --> 01:47:25.814
When a forest grows too wild,
a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

1178
01:47:27.024 --> 01:47:31.695
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror
as its greatest city destroys itself.

1179
01:47:32.237 --> 01:47:35.491
The movement back to harmony
will be unstoppable this time.

1180
01:47:35.783 --> 01:47:37.993
-You attacked Gotham before?
-Of course.

1181
01:47:38.202 --> 01:47:40.871
Over the ages our weapons
have grown more sophisticated.

1182
01:47:41.038 --> 01:47:43.874
With Gotham we tried a new one.
Economics.

1183
01:47:44.333 --> 01:47:49.046
But we underestimated certain
of Gotham's citizens...

1184
01:47:49.463 --> 01:47:51.674
...such as your parents.

1185
01:47:55.719 --> 01:47:59.223
Gunned down by one of the very people
they were trying to help.

1186
01:47:59.473 --> 01:48:02.226
Create enough hunger
and everyone becomes a criminal.

1187
01:48:02.393 --> 01:48:04.895
Their deaths galvanized the city
into saving itself...

1188
01:48:05.062 --> 01:48:07.731
...and Gotham has limped on
ever since.

1189
01:48:07.898 --> 01:48:09.733
We are back to finish the job.

1190
01:48:10.401 --> 01:48:13.696
And this time no misguided idealists
will get in the way.

1191
01:48:13.862 --> 01:48:17.408
Like your father, you lack the courage
to do all that is necessary.

1192
01:48:17.741 --> 01:48:20.577
If someone stands in the way
of true justice...

1193
01:48:20.786 --> 01:48:24.873
...you simply walk up behind them
and stab them in the heart.

1194
01:48:29.878 --> 01:48:32.047
-I am gonna stop you.
-You never did learn...

1195
01:48:32.214 --> 01:48:34.258
...to mind your surroundings.

1196
01:48:36.427 --> 01:48:38.429
Justice is balance.

1197
01:48:38.595 --> 01:48:40.764
You burned my house
and left me for dead.

1198
01:48:43.434 --> 01:48:45.602
Consider us even.

1199
01:49:01.952 --> 01:49:03.746
No one comes out. Make sure.

1200
01:49:13.630 --> 01:49:15.090
They're all gone?

1201
01:49:15.257 --> 01:49:17.968
-How many from maximum security?
-Every one of them.

1202
01:49:18.135 --> 01:49:19.970
Serial killers, rapists.

1203
01:49:20.137 --> 01:49:22.973
Raise the bridges.
We don't want any getting off the island.

1204
01:49:23.140 --> 01:49:24.808
Yeah, I'll raise the bridges...

1205
01:49:24.975 --> 01:49:29.063
...when I get every available unit out here
to catch the homicidal maniacs...

1206
01:49:29.229 --> 01:49:32.107
-...that are running loose out there.
-Come on!

1207
01:49:55.297 --> 01:49:58.008
I hope you're not a member
of the fire brigade.

1208
01:50:04.014 --> 01:50:06.183
Master Wayne! Master Wayne!

1209
01:50:10.687 --> 01:50:15.025
What is the point of all those pushups
if you can't even lift a bloody log?

1210
01:50:53.522 --> 01:50:55.566
What have I done, Alfred?

1211
01:50:56.567 --> 01:50:58.569
Everything my family...

1212
01:50:58.735 --> 01:51:00.654
...my father, built...

1213
01:51:03.031 --> 01:51:06.910
The Wayne legacy is more
than bricks and mortar, sir.

1214
01:51:07.077 --> 01:51:09.371
I wanted to save Gotham.

1215
01:51:10.205 --> 01:51:12.082
I failed.

1216
01:51:13.250 --> 01:51:14.585
Why do we fall, sir?

1217
01:51:17.754 --> 01:51:21.258
So that we can learn
to pick ourselves up.

1218
01:51:23.719 --> 01:51:25.888
You still haven't given up on me?

1219
01:51:27.764 --> 01:51:29.266
Never.

1220
01:51:30.267 --> 01:51:31.602
Down!

1221
01:51:31.768 --> 01:51:34.730
Harassment! I see harassment!

1222
01:51:34.897 --> 01:51:36.940
Maybe you'd like to see
some excessive force?

1223
01:51:37.107 --> 01:51:39.067
Madman with a gun.

1224
01:51:40.110 --> 01:51:41.778
<i>With residents furious...</i>

1225
01:51:41.987 --> 01:51:45.115
<i>...at the unprecedented show of police
strength to round up the inmates...</i>

1226
01:51:45.282 --> 01:51:47.117
We're about to raise these bridges.

1227
01:51:47.284 --> 01:51:50.954
Officer, I am a Gotham City
district attorney. Let me pass.

1228
01:51:58.295 --> 01:52:00.631
-Just shut up!
-Hey, Flass, cool it!

1229
01:52:00.797 --> 01:52:02.299
Hold these people back.

1230
01:52:02.466 --> 01:52:05.260
Hey, Gordon.
Somebody here to see you.

1231
01:52:05.427 --> 01:52:07.804
-What are you doing here?
-Our friend sent me with this.

1232
01:52:08.013 --> 01:52:09.473
It counteracts Crane's toxin.

1233
01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:11.141
Hopefully you won't need it.

1234
01:52:11.308 --> 01:52:14.478
Not unless he's got some way
of getting that crap into the air.

1235
01:52:15.604 --> 01:52:18.065
All right, last one across.

1236
01:52:18.732 --> 01:52:22.653
People, they want this
bridge up in no more than three minutes!

1237
01:52:22.819 --> 01:52:26.240
Better get you off the island before
they raise the bridges. Patrolman!

1238
01:52:26.823 --> 01:52:27.866
Go!

1239
01:52:54.685 --> 01:52:56.520
I can't find my mom.

1240
01:52:56.853 --> 01:52:58.355
Hey!

1241
01:53:06.697 --> 01:53:08.490
What the hell are you doing?

1242
01:53:09.992 --> 01:53:11.576
Gentlemen...

1243
01:53:11.994 --> 01:53:14.538
...time to spread the word.

1244
01:53:16.206 --> 01:53:17.666
And the word is...

1245
01:53:18.875 --> 01:53:20.669
...panic.

1246
01:53:44.651 --> 01:53:46.194
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.

1247
01:53:47.571 --> 01:53:48.697
Right there.

1248
01:53:48.989 --> 01:53:51.241
That water main
is right under the Narrows.

1249
01:54:08.175 --> 01:54:09.760
It's okay.

1250
01:54:42.584 --> 01:54:44.127
This is Commissioner Loeb.

1251
01:54:44.294 --> 01:54:45.962
Come on, somebody talk to me.

1252
01:54:46.171 --> 01:54:47.631
Come on!

1253
01:55:07.317 --> 01:55:09.319
Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon.

1254
01:55:09.653 --> 01:55:10.987
What the hell is going on?

1255
01:55:11.154 --> 01:55:14.616
We need reinforcements.
TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!

1256
01:55:14.783 --> 01:55:18.995
Gordon! All the city's riot police
are on the island with you!

1257
01:55:19.162 --> 01:55:21.832
<i>Well, they're completely incapacitated!</i>

1258
01:55:21.998 --> 01:55:25.502
It's okay, it's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you.

1259
01:55:26.336 --> 01:55:28.004
Of course they are!

1260
01:55:28.171 --> 01:55:31.174
-Crane?
-No. Scarecrow.

1261
01:55:32.926 --> 01:55:34.344
Gordon...

1262
01:55:34.511 --> 01:55:36.763
...there's nobody left to send in.

1263
01:55:38.265 --> 01:55:39.975
So I'm on my own?

1264
01:55:44.062 --> 01:55:45.730
The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

1265
01:55:45.897 --> 01:55:48.483
This is just the beginning.
If they hit the whole city...

1266
01:55:48.650 --> 01:55:51.403
...there's nothing to stop Gotham
tearing itself apart.

1267
01:55:51.570 --> 01:55:53.488
-How are they gonna do that?
-The train.

1268
01:55:53.655 --> 01:55:57.492
<i>The monorail follows the water mains to
the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.</i>

1269
01:55:57.659 --> 01:55:59.369
<i>If the machine gets to the station...</i>

1270
01:55:59.536 --> 01:56:03.039
...it'll cause a chain reaction
that'll vaporize the city's water supply.

1271
01:56:03.206 --> 01:56:04.791
Covering Gotham in this poison.

1272
01:56:04.958 --> 01:56:08.170
I'm gonna stop him from loading
that train, but I may need your help.

1273
01:56:08.336 --> 01:56:10.130
-What do you need?
-Can you drive stick?

1274
01:56:16.386 --> 01:56:18.054
There you are!

1275
01:56:18.221 --> 01:56:20.223
There is nothing to fear...

1276
01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:22.142
...but fear itself!

1277
01:56:23.185 --> 01:56:24.936
I am here to help you!

1278
01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:58.929
Batman will save us. He'll come.

1279
01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:06.061
-He'll come.
-Don't peek.

1280
01:57:14.694 --> 01:57:18.073
This is Gordon.
Prepare to lower the bridge.

1281
01:57:23.954 --> 01:57:26.081
I told you he'd come.

1282
01:57:31.086 --> 01:57:32.712
Wait.

1283
01:57:33.630 --> 01:57:35.298
You could die.

1284
01:57:35.465 --> 01:57:36.758
At least tell me your name.

1285
01:57:42.138 --> 01:57:44.349
It's not who I am underneath...

1286
01:57:45.308 --> 01:57:49.729
...but what I do that defines me.

1287
01:57:49.980 --> 01:57:51.314
Bruce?

1288
01:58:25.015 --> 01:58:28.351
Well, well. You took my advice
about theatricality a bit literally.

1289
01:58:28.518 --> 01:58:31.021
-It ends here.
-For you and the police, maybe.

1290
01:58:31.187 --> 01:58:33.523
My fight, however,
lies with the rest of Gotham.

1291
01:58:33.690 --> 01:58:37.027
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a city to destroy.

1292
01:58:37.193 --> 01:58:40.905
-I can't beat two of your pawns?
-As you wish.

1293
01:58:53.710 --> 01:58:56.046
<i>GPS online.</i>

1294
01:59:02.886 --> 01:59:05.055
<i>In 100 yards.</i>

1295
01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:37.253
Gentlemen.

1296
02:00:04.614 --> 02:00:06.908
Who the hell authorized this?

1297
02:00:17.460 --> 02:00:19.546
<i>Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.</i>

1298
02:00:26.803 --> 02:00:29.431
The pressure's moving along the mains,
blowing the pipes.

1299
02:00:29.597 --> 02:00:30.974
If that pressure reaches us...

1300
02:00:31.141 --> 02:00:34.144
...the water supply right across
the whole city is gonna blow!

1301
02:00:44.612 --> 02:00:47.490
<i>At the next intersection, turn right.</i>

1302
02:01:12.182 --> 02:01:13.641
You will never learn.

1303
02:01:21.191 --> 02:01:22.192
Sorry.

1304
02:01:26.196 --> 02:01:29.199
-Familiar. Don't you have anything new?
-How about this?!

1305
02:01:45.965 --> 02:01:48.218
<i>You have arrived at Wayne Tower.</i>

1306
02:02:01.564 --> 02:02:02.816
Evacuate the building.

1307
02:02:03.024 --> 02:02:05.527
We're on top of the main hub
and it's gonna blow.

1308
02:02:14.410 --> 02:02:16.621
<i>Weapons system activated.</i>

1309
02:02:20.708 --> 02:02:21.751
Nice ride.

1310
02:02:36.933 --> 02:02:38.017
<i>Armed.</i>

1311
02:02:49.946 --> 02:02:51.406
Don't be afraid, Bruce.

1312
02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:55.577
Come on. Come on.

1313
02:03:00.290 --> 02:03:02.417
You are just an ordinary man in a cape.

1314
02:03:02.584 --> 02:03:06.462
That's why you couldn't fight injustice,
that's why you can't stop this train.

1315
02:03:06.629 --> 02:03:09.215
Who said anything about stopping it?

1316
02:03:14.971 --> 02:03:16.556
Yes!

1317
02:03:24.731 --> 02:03:28.151
You never learned
to mind your surroundings!

1318
02:03:35.992 --> 02:03:38.494
Have you finally learned to do
what is necessary?

1319
02:03:38.786 --> 02:03:41.080
I won't kill you...

1320
02:03:45.501 --> 02:03:47.670
...but I don't have to save you.

1321
02:05:02.829 --> 02:05:05.915
-The meeting's already started.
-What meeting?

1322
02:05:10.169 --> 02:05:13.089
Fox, I seem to remember firing you.

1323
02:05:13.589 --> 02:05:15.174
You did.

1324
02:05:15.341 --> 02:05:17.427
I got another job.

1325
02:05:18.261 --> 02:05:19.721
Yours.

1326
02:05:20.179 --> 02:05:21.889
On whose authority?

1327
02:05:22.390 --> 02:05:24.434
Batman may
have made the front page...

1328
02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:27.562
...but Bruce Wayne
got pushed to page eight.

1329
02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:35.403
Bruce Wayne.

1330
02:05:35.570 --> 02:05:39.365
What makes you think you can decide
who's running Wayne Enterprises?

1331
02:05:39.532 --> 02:05:42.410
-The fact that I'm the owner.
<i>-What are you talking about?</i>

1332
02:05:42.577 --> 02:05:44.454
The company went public a week ago.

1333
02:05:44.620 --> 02:05:46.080
And I bought most of the shares.

1334
02:05:46.456 --> 02:05:49.917
<i>Through various charitable foundations
and trusts and so forth.</i>

1335
02:05:50.084 --> 02:05:53.296
Look, it's all a bit technical,
but the important thing...

1336
02:05:53.463 --> 02:05:56.799
<i>...is that my company's future
is secure.</i>

1337
02:05:57.133 --> 02:05:58.593
Right, Mr. Fox?

1338
02:05:58.760 --> 02:06:00.595
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1339
02:06:02.805 --> 02:06:04.390
Didn't you get the memo?

1340
02:06:23.326 --> 02:06:26.496
-I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel.
-No. No, Bruce...

1341
02:06:26.662 --> 02:06:28.081
...I'm sorry.

1342
02:06:28.956 --> 02:06:31.626
The day that Chill died, l...

1343
02:06:33.503 --> 02:06:35.129
I said terrible things.

1344
02:06:35.630 --> 02:06:37.381
But true things.

1345
02:06:38.007 --> 02:06:39.842
I was a coward with a gun...

1346
02:06:40.009 --> 02:06:43.805
...and justice is about more
than revenge, so thank you.

1347
02:06:44.847 --> 02:06:47.517
I never stopped thinking about you.

1348
02:06:49.018 --> 02:06:50.645
About us.

1349
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:53.189
And when I heard you were back, l...

1350
02:06:54.023 --> 02:06:56.275
I started to hope.

1351
02:07:20.341 --> 02:07:23.052
But then I found out about your mask.

1352
02:07:24.220 --> 02:07:27.056
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

1353
02:07:27.682 --> 02:07:29.350
No. This...

1354
02:07:30.518 --> 02:07:32.228
...is your mask.

1355
02:07:34.188 --> 02:07:37.733
Your real face is the one
that criminals now fear.

1356
02:07:38.568 --> 02:07:40.570
The man I loved...

1357
02:07:41.237 --> 02:07:42.738
...the man who vanished...

1358
02:07:43.948 --> 02:07:46.075
...he never came back at all.

1359
02:07:50.580 --> 02:07:53.249
But maybe he's still
out there somewhere.

1360
02:07:55.418 --> 02:07:59.088
Maybe someday,
when Gotham no longer needs Batman...

1361
02:08:00.173 --> 02:08:02.091
...I'll see him again.

1362
02:08:13.186 --> 02:08:16.105
-Proved me wrong, you know.
-About what?

1363
02:08:18.941 --> 02:08:21.402
Your father would be very proud of you.

1364
02:08:21.611 --> 02:08:23.237
Just like me.

1365
02:08:50.223 --> 02:08:52.099
What will you do?

1366
02:08:53.476 --> 02:08:55.061
Rebuild it.

1367
02:08:55.937 --> 02:08:58.314
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1368
02:09:05.154 --> 02:09:06.405
Just the way it was, sir?

1369
02:09:08.491 --> 02:09:09.742
Yeah, why?

1370
02:09:09.909 --> 02:09:12.745
I thought this might be
a good opportunity for...

1371
02:09:12.912 --> 02:09:15.331
...improving the foundations.

1372
02:09:15.539 --> 02:09:18.501
-In the southeast corner?
-Precisely, sir.

1373
02:09:34.183 --> 02:09:37.061
-Nice.
-I couldn't find any mob bosses.

1374
02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:40.690
-Well, sergeant?
-It's "lieutenant" now.

1375
02:09:41.065 --> 02:09:42.525
You really started something.

1376
02:09:42.692 --> 02:09:44.694
Bent cops running scared.

1377
02:09:44.860 --> 02:09:46.320
Hope on the streets.

1378
02:09:46.570 --> 02:09:50.199
-But?
-The Narrows is lost.

1379
02:09:50.700 --> 02:09:54.537
And we still haven't picked up Crane or
half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1380
02:09:55.204 --> 02:09:56.872
We will.

1381
02:09:57.081 --> 02:09:58.708
We can bring Gotham back.

1382
02:09:58.874 --> 02:10:01.377
-What about escalation?
-Escalation?

1383
02:10:01.585 --> 02:10:05.881
We start carrying semiautomatics,
they buy automatics.

1384
02:10:06.090 --> 02:10:10.386
We start wearing Kevlar,
they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1385
02:10:10.594 --> 02:10:13.889
-And?
-And you're wearing a mask...

1386
02:10:14.307 --> 02:10:16.183
...and jumping off rooftops.

1387
02:10:17.601 --> 02:10:19.645
Now, take this guy.

1388
02:10:19.895 --> 02:10:21.897
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1389
02:10:22.106 --> 02:10:25.359
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1390
02:10:25.609 --> 02:10:27.570
Leaves a calling card.

1391
02:10:33.409 --> 02:10:35.244
I'll look into it.

1392
02:10:38.748 --> 02:10:40.207
I never said thank you.

1393
02:10:45.254 --> 02:10:47.381
And you'll never have to.
