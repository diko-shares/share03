We are paying you for that.

521
00:47:07.908 --> 00:47:10.411
Maybe money isn't as interesting
to me as favours.

522
00:47:12.913 --> 00:47:17.751
I am more than aware that you are
not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

523
00:47:17.918 --> 00:47:21.005

and when he gets here--

524
00:47:21.171 --> 00:47:23.090
He-- He's coming to Gotham?

525
00:47:23.257 --> 00:47:24.717
Yes, he is.

526
00:47:24.883 --> 00:47:27.344
And when he gets here,
he's not going to wanna hear...

527
00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:32.599
...that you've endangered our operation
just to get your thugs out of jail time.

528
00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.937
-Who's bothering you?
-There's a girl at the DA's office.

529
00:47:37.438 --> 00:47:39.231
-We'll buy her off.
-Not this one.

530

Well, there's an answer to that too.

Thomas would probably not
have taken the company public.

-Why is no one answering the phone?

549
