1
00:00:16.536 --> 00:00:18.146
Speak Josie, speak.

2
00:01:31.176 --> 00:01:33.569
Smooth move, klutz.

3
00:01:33.613 --> 00:01:34.570
Loser!

4
00:01:34.614 --> 00:01:37.095
All right, class, settle down.

5
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.707
Mickey.

6
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.945
Come up here and
solve this problem

7
00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.797
on the board for me.

8
00:02:00.683 --> 00:02:02.859
I'll see you after class.

9
00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:05.645
Ooooh!

10
00:02:05.688 --> 00:02:07.560
Hey, hey,
that's enough of that.

11
00:02:07.603 --> 00:02:10.215
Go to the board and
solve the problem.

12
00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:25.969
Hey, word on the street is
Mickey is gonna bust you up

13
00:02:26.013 --> 00:02:28.058
like he did that 10th
grader last week.

14
00:02:28.102 --> 00:02:29.799
Whew, that was not pretty.

15
00:02:29.843 --> 00:02:30.974
Thanks.

16
00:02:31.018 --> 00:02:32.846
You're not helping.

17
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.936
Maybe I can make it to
the car before he gets me.

18
00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:36.979
Yeah, maybe.

19
00:02:41.637 --> 00:02:42.856
Dead man walking.

20
00:02:51.865 --> 00:02:54.520
Where do you think
you're going, geek?

21
00:02:54.563 --> 00:02:57.000
Let's see if the little wussy
scout can knock me down now.

22
00:02:57.044 --> 00:02:59.220
Look, I didn't mean to
trip you, it was an accident.

23
00:02:59.264 --> 00:03:00.961
Accident huh?

24
00:03:01.004 --> 00:03:03.964
I think it's time for
you to have an accident.

25
00:03:04.007 --> 00:03:05.966
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

26
00:03:06.836 --> 00:03:08.186
Fight, fight, fight!

27
00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:10.229
Didn't they teach you
self-defense in Boy Scouts?

28
00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:13.352
Looks like the only thing
you know how to do is bleed!

29
00:03:14.757 --> 00:03:16.150
- Hey, hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

30
00:03:16.194 --> 00:03:17.194
Here.

31
00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:20.676
You're bleeding.

32
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.026
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

33
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.854
Now we're both
gonna be in trouble.

34
00:03:24.898 --> 00:03:27.988
What are they
gonna do? Suspend me?

35
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:31.687
Lets see, that means
I get to stay home,

36
00:03:31.731 --> 00:03:35.256
sleep late, uh, and swim
in the pool all day.

37
00:03:36.736 --> 00:03:39.217
Why did you help me?

38
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.872
Because your nose
was taking a pounding

39
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.224
and I sort of like your nose.

40
00:04:00.934 --> 00:04:02.936
What happened to you?

41
00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:04.130
I don't wanna talk about it.

42
00:04:04.154 --> 00:04:05.939
It looks like somebody
got into a fight.

43
00:04:05.982 --> 00:04:08.028
My Sunday school
teacher says you should

44
00:04:08.071 --> 00:04:10.987
always turn the other cheek
and you should never fight.

45
00:04:11.031 --> 00:04:13.033
- Yeah, thanks.
I'll remember that.

46
00:04:13.076 --> 00:04:14.252
Are you okay?

47
00:04:15.165 --> 00:04:16.165
Hey.

48
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.909
Oh.

49
00:04:19.953 --> 00:04:23.173
If you don't wanna tell me
about it, that's okay, okay?

50
00:04:23.217 --> 00:04:26.176
You tell me when you're ready.

51
00:04:41.061 --> 00:04:42.149
Are you asleep?

52
00:04:43.106 --> 00:04:44.282
No. I can't.

53
00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:51.332
Do you wanna tell
me what's wrong?

54
00:04:51.376 --> 00:04:54.944
Well, to start off, everyone
at school makes fun of me,

55
00:04:54.988 --> 00:04:57.947
I got no friends,
nobody likes me,

56
00:04:57.991 --> 00:05:00.994
and the saddest part is, I don't
even know if I like myself.

57
00:05:01.037 --> 00:05:05.303
Sweetheart, you are a
loving, caring, wonderful boy.

58
00:05:06.434 --> 00:05:08.001
Why would you say such a thing?

59
00:05:08.044 --> 00:05:12.048
I don't know mom,
maybe it's this place.

60
00:05:12.092 --> 00:05:14.094
Well what do you mean?

61
00:05:15.095 --> 00:05:17.010
Remember when Dad took
us up to the mountains

62
00:05:17.053 --> 00:05:18.185
and Grandma and Grandpa's?

63
00:05:18.228 --> 00:05:19.839
Yeah.

64
00:05:19.882 --> 00:05:22.145
That was one of the
best weekends of my life.

65
00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:24.123
I just think spending some
time away from this place

66
00:05:24.147 --> 00:05:25.975
would be good for all of us.

67
00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:28.848
And plus, I miss Uncle Joey.

68
00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:30.478
Yeah, well Uncle Joey
has his own life now

69
00:05:30.502 --> 00:05:32.852
and I can't miss any work.

70
00:05:33.896 --> 00:05:38.727
Well, he said he'd come and
get us whenever we wanted.

71
00:05:39.424 --> 00:05:41.121
I just don't know.

72
00:05:44.124 --> 00:05:45.124
Please, mom.

73
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.825
You really want
this, don't you?

74
00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:52.959
Not only do I want
this, I need it.

75
00:05:55.135 --> 00:05:56.484
Okay.

76
00:05:56.528 --> 00:06:00.358
Let me think about it and
we'll talk in the morning.

77
00:06:00.401 --> 00:06:01.315
I love you.

78
00:06:01.359 --> 00:06:02.098
I love you too, Mom.

79
00:06:02.142 --> 00:06:03.361
Okay.

80
00:06:58.067 --> 00:07:00.461
Oh excuse me.

81
00:07:00.505 --> 00:07:02.289
I'll be right back.

82
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.904
Hello?

83
00:07:08.948 --> 00:07:10.906
Hey, Joey?

84
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.255
It's Peggy.

85
00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:15.520
Sis, hey. How are
you and the kids doing?

86
00:07:15.563 --> 00:07:17.086
Good.

87
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.479
Um, sorry to call so late.

88
00:07:18.523 --> 00:07:20.176
Are you already in bed?

89
00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:24.050
Uh, not yet.

90
00:07:25.225 --> 00:07:26.966
Are Mom and Dad there?

91
00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:28.944
Mom and Dad, they went
out of town for the weekend

92
00:07:28.968 --> 00:07:30.796
to go see Aunt Judy
up in the hospital.

93
00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:32.034
They'll be back
tomorrow, though.

94
00:07:32.058 --> 00:07:34.103
Do you want me to
tell them to call you?

95
00:07:34.147 --> 00:07:37.019
No, I just need to
ask them a question.

96
00:07:37.063 --> 00:07:38.606
Is there anything
I can help you with?

97
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.197
I think the kids wanna
come out for the weekend.

98
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:42.329
Cool.

99
00:07:42.372 --> 00:07:43.524
I just don't wanna
interrupt anything.

100
00:07:43.548 --> 00:07:44.940
I wanted to make
sure it was okay.

101
00:07:44.984 --> 00:07:47.247
Sis, you're never
interrupting anything.

102
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.815
You guys know you are
welcomed here, okay?

103
00:07:49.858 --> 00:07:51.120
So when are you coming?

104
00:07:51.164 --> 00:07:52.382
Oh, that's just it.

105
00:07:52.426 --> 00:07:54.123
I have to work, so I
was hoping that maybe

106
00:07:54.167 --> 00:07:56.256
you and Dad could pick up
the kids for the weekend?

107
00:07:56.299 --> 00:07:57.538
I will come up and personally

108
00:07:57.562 --> 00:07:59.085
pick the kids up
tomorrow morning.

109
00:07:59.128 --> 00:08:00.541
Really? Are you
sure it's no trouble?

110
00:08:00.565 --> 00:08:02.610
Of course. Who's
their favorite uncle?

111
00:08:02.654 --> 00:08:04.046
You are.

112
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.371
All right, then I'll
be there to see you.

113
00:08:05.395 --> 00:08:06.571
Tomorrow morning.

114
00:08:06.614 --> 00:08:08.573
Joey, the kids are
gonna be so happy.

115
00:08:08.616 --> 00:08:10.226
Thank you.

116
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.314
Bye.

117
00:08:17.059 --> 00:08:18.147
Get up! Get up!

118
00:08:18.191 --> 00:08:19.366
No, go away!

119
00:08:19.409 --> 00:08:21.455
You better wake up
or you're gonna miss

120
00:08:21.499 --> 00:08:23.152
your trip to the mountains.

121
00:08:23.196 --> 00:08:24.458
What?

122
00:08:24.502 --> 00:08:27.026
You're not joking, are you?

123
00:08:27.069 --> 00:08:28.331
Yes, yes, yes!

124
00:08:28.375 --> 00:08:30.029
Yes, yes!

125
00:08:30.072 --> 00:08:31.354
But you need to hurry
up because your Uncle Joey

126
00:08:31.378 --> 00:08:35.034
is on his way, so you
need to start packing.

127
00:08:35.077 --> 00:08:36.383
Yes!

128
00:08:36.426 --> 00:08:38.080
Let's go.

129
00:08:45.566 --> 00:08:46.872
Oh, boy, are you ready?

130
00:08:46.915 --> 00:08:47.742
Yup.

131
00:08:47.786 --> 00:08:51.877
Oh my god.

132
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:52.530
Hey!

133
00:08:52.573 --> 00:08:53.573
- Hey!
- Hey!

134
00:08:54.619 --> 00:08:55.358
Woo, wow, you
should grow more.

135
00:08:55.402 --> 00:08:56.272
Yeah.

136
00:08:56.316 --> 00:08:57.491
Good to see you. Hi, sis.

137
00:08:57.535 --> 00:08:58.555
Thank you for
coming to get them.

138
00:08:58.579 --> 00:08:59.885
Oh you're so welcome.

139
00:08:59.928 --> 00:09:00.625
We're gonna have a great
weekend, aren't we?

140
00:09:00.668 --> 00:09:02.191
- Hi.
- Give me a hug.

141
00:09:02.235 --> 00:09:04.324
They need a good weekend away.

142
00:09:04.367 --> 00:09:05.238
Well, they're gonna have it.

143
00:09:05.281 --> 00:09:06.389
Here let's hug it out, buddy.

144
00:09:06.413 --> 00:09:08.197
All right, now
give me your stuff.

145
00:09:08.241 --> 00:09:09.198
Let's get loaded up.

146
00:09:09.242 --> 00:09:10.504
Okay.

147
00:09:10.548 --> 00:09:11.374
- I call shotgun.
- Call me when you get there.

148
00:09:11.418 --> 00:09:12.898
Yeah, yeah, I know.

149
00:09:13.594 --> 00:09:15.204
Take good care of your sister.

150
00:09:15.248 --> 00:09:16.031
Yes, I know.

151
00:09:16.075 --> 00:09:17.119
Okay.

152
00:09:17.163 --> 00:09:18.207
- Oh you need help?
- Yep.

153
00:09:18.251 --> 00:09:19.252
I got you.

154
00:09:20.993 --> 00:09:22.536
- Can you hop in?
- Okay, watch your phone.

155
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.561
Okay.

156
00:09:23.604 --> 00:09:25.084
Okay.

157
00:09:25.127 --> 00:09:26.215
You take care of my babies.

158
00:09:26.259 --> 00:09:28.217
I sure will.

159
00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:29.412
- Buckle up.
- All right, kids buckle up.

160
00:09:29.436 --> 00:09:30.587
- Buckle up.
- Put you seatbelt on.

161
00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:32.352
I know, Mom.

162
00:09:34.659 --> 00:09:36.922
Be good, now.

163
00:09:36.965 --> 00:09:37.965
Bye.

164
00:09:42.275 --> 00:09:44.059
So how's school?

165
00:09:44.103 --> 00:09:45.408
I like school.

166
00:09:45.452 --> 00:09:46.453
What about you, Scottie?

167
00:09:46.496 --> 00:09:47.715
He doesn't like school

168
00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:48.542
because he doesn't
have any friends.

169
00:09:48.586 --> 00:09:50.065
What? I have friends.

170
00:09:50.109 --> 00:09:51.023
Who?

171
00:09:51.066 --> 00:09:52.328
Victor and Tommy Adkins.

172
00:09:52.372 --> 00:09:54.722
Victor is a huge
nerd and Tommy Adkins?

173
00:09:54.766 --> 00:09:57.159
Yuck, he's the
smelliest boy in school.

174
00:09:57.203 --> 00:09:58.596
He smells like pickles.

175
00:09:58.639 --> 00:10:00.119
I'm not kidding.

176
00:10:01.468 --> 00:10:03.296
Kids in school picking on you?

177
00:10:03.339 --> 00:10:05.994
The only time they talk
to me is to pick on me.

178
00:10:06.038 --> 00:10:07.561
What do you do about that?

179
00:10:07.605 --> 00:10:10.129
I don't do anything.

180
00:10:10.172 --> 00:10:12.653
Well, you have to
stand up for yourself.

181
00:10:12.697 --> 00:10:14.263
What do you mean? Like fight?

182
00:10:14.307 --> 00:10:16.178
If you have to.

183
00:10:16.222 --> 00:10:18.026
What do you do for fun
when you're not in school?

184
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.399
He doesn't do anything.

185
00:10:19.442 --> 00:10:21.290
He just sits in his room
all day and picks his nose.

186
00:10:21.314 --> 00:10:22.315
Is that true?

187
00:10:22.358 --> 00:10:23.403
Yeah.

188
00:10:24.796 --> 00:10:27.712
You know, tomorrow's
not promised buddy.

189
00:10:27.755 --> 00:10:29.385
You gotta have fun,
you gotta get out there

190
00:10:29.409 --> 00:10:31.237
and live a little bit.

191
00:10:32.499 --> 00:10:34.675
Uncle Joey, can I
ask you a question?

192
00:10:34.719 --> 00:10:35.633
Sure.

193
00:10:35.676 --> 00:10:37.112
Aren't you a little old

194
00:10:37.156 --> 00:10:38.679
to be living at home
with your parents?

195
00:10:38.723 --> 00:10:41.508
Oh well you know, I tried
that whole move out of the house

196
00:10:41.551 --> 00:10:43.597
and get a job thing
and it really stunk.

197
00:10:43.641 --> 00:10:45.381
So whatever you
do, don't do that

198
00:10:45.425 --> 00:10:47.209
and always stay at home.

199
00:10:47.253 --> 00:10:48.428
Never leave home.

200
00:10:50.082 --> 00:10:52.475
I ain't gonna lie,
I thought about it.

201
00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:54.608
Just the other day,
I was on my bike

202
00:10:54.652 --> 00:10:57.002
and I thought to myself
I could pedal across

203
00:10:57.045 --> 00:10:59.178
the United States
if I wanted to.

204
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:01.659
You know, just go.
Hit the open road.

205
00:11:01.702 --> 00:11:04.313
I can see me now, the
wind blowing in my hair.

206
00:11:04.357 --> 00:11:05.663
It would be a wild trip.

207
00:11:05.706 --> 00:11:07.795
I don't know kid, that
sounds a little dangerous.

208
00:11:07.839 --> 00:11:10.363
Uncle Joey, I'm dangerous.

209
00:11:14.672 --> 00:11:17.544
Hey, I've got a
question for you guys.

210
00:11:17.587 --> 00:11:18.695
Do you wanna go
camping this weekend?

211
00:11:18.719 --> 00:11:20.112
Yeah!

212
00:11:20.155 --> 00:11:22.157
A group of friends and
I we go camping a lot

213
00:11:22.201 --> 00:11:23.681
and we play war games.

214
00:11:23.724 --> 00:11:25.291
What's war games?

215
00:11:25.334 --> 00:11:28.163
War games is like,
it's all about strategy

216
00:11:28.207 --> 00:11:29.425
and survival, you know?

217
00:11:29.469 --> 00:11:31.099
We pick a spot way out
in the middle of nowhere

218
00:11:31.123 --> 00:11:32.578
and we put this yellow
flag and the first person

219
00:11:32.602 --> 00:11:35.344
or team to get to
that yellow flag wins.

220
00:11:35.388 --> 00:11:37.042
Okay, it sounds easy.

221
00:11:37.085 --> 00:11:38.367
Yeah, but the hard part
is getting to that flag

222
00:11:38.391 --> 00:11:39.697
without getting shot or killed.

223
00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:40.740
Killed?

224
00:11:41.742 --> 00:11:43.439
Well, we don't
really get killed.

225
00:11:43.483 --> 00:11:44.919
We do it with paint ball guns.

226
00:11:44.963 --> 00:11:47.530
You know, they look like real
guns but it's just paint.

227
00:11:47.574 --> 00:11:49.489
So no one gets hurt?

228
00:11:49.532 --> 00:11:51.360
Well I mean, it
hurts if you get hit

229
00:11:51.404 --> 00:11:53.188
but it only stings for a minute.

230
00:11:53.232 --> 00:11:54.712
And it's so much fun.

231
00:11:55.669 --> 00:11:57.062
What do you say?

232
00:11:57.105 --> 00:11:57.715
I'm in.

233
00:11:57.758 --> 00:11:58.541
Me, too.

234
00:11:58.585 --> 00:11:59.542
All right, great.

235
00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:00.761
Hey you know what, though?

236
00:12:00.805 --> 00:12:01.544
I need you to do
something for me.

237
00:12:01.588 --> 00:12:02.589
What?

238
00:12:09.814 --> 00:12:11.206
Hey, Scottie.

239
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.401
Get out of the car and
come talk man-to-man

240
00:12:12.425 --> 00:12:14.122
with me for a second.

241
00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.541
Hey listen, I need you to call
your mom for me, all right?

242
00:12:23.566 --> 00:12:25.177
I need you to tell her we're at

243
00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.632
Grandma and Grandpa's house and
if she asks to talk to them,

244
00:12:26.656 --> 00:12:27.895
you gotta tell her
that they're in town

245
00:12:27.919 --> 00:12:29.572
doing some stuff, okay?

246
00:12:29.616 --> 00:12:30.811
Why? Why do I have to do this?

247
00:12:30.835 --> 00:12:33.141
It's the only way.

248
00:12:33.185 --> 00:12:34.142
Why...

249
00:12:34.186 --> 00:12:35.491
Why do I have to lie?

250
00:12:35.535 --> 00:12:36.730
Because your mom will
kill me if I take you away

251
00:12:36.754 --> 00:12:38.233
to the woods for
the weekend, man.

252
00:12:38.277 --> 00:12:39.757
Come on, hey, in the Boy Scouts

253
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.236
there's a code of honor, right?

254
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.605
So my friends and I have
a code of honor, too.

255
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:43.824
I'm not really supposed
to tell anybody

256
00:12:43.848 --> 00:12:46.285
what we do on the weekends.

257
00:12:47.373 --> 00:12:49.592
But, from the sounds of it,
you could use some adventure

258
00:12:49.636 --> 00:12:51.812
more than anyone I've
ever seen in my life, man.

259
00:12:51.856 --> 00:12:53.727
Come on, you're 14-years-old,
you're a man now.

260
00:12:53.771 --> 00:12:55.651
It's time to use some of
those Boy Scout skills.

261
00:12:55.685 --> 00:12:57.315
And what better place do
do it than out in the woods

262
00:12:57.339 --> 00:12:59.472
where survival is everything?

263
00:12:59.515 --> 00:13:00.386
So what do you say?

264
00:13:00.429 --> 00:13:01.430
Are we gonna do this?

265
00:13:01.474 --> 00:13:02.692
I don't know.

266
00:13:03.868 --> 00:13:05.521
Look, I'll make
this easy on you.

267
00:13:05.565 --> 00:13:06.784
The road to the left there,

268
00:13:06.827 --> 00:13:08.568
that goes to Grandma
and Grandpa's house.

269
00:13:08.611 --> 00:13:10.875
The road to the right, it goes
way up in to the mountains

270
00:13:10.918 --> 00:13:13.312
where eventually the
war games will start.

271
00:13:13.355 --> 00:13:15.140
So you just point the way.

272
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.930
All right, call your mom.

273
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:28.370
Let me talk to her.

274
00:13:34.333 --> 00:13:34.899
Hello?

275
00:13:34.942 --> 00:13:35.813
Hey, sis.

276
00:13:35.856 --> 00:13:37.466
- Joey?
- Yeah, yeah.

277
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.424
Hey, I wanted to just
call you and let you know

278
00:13:38.467 --> 00:13:39.599
everything's doing great.

279
00:13:39.642 --> 00:13:40.469
Are you already there?

280
00:13:40.513 --> 00:13:42.210
Yeah, yeah.

281
00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:44.275
I mean, there wasn't a lot of
traffic so we made good time.

282
00:13:44.299 --> 00:13:45.518
How are the kids?

283
00:13:45.561 --> 00:13:47.235
Oh, they're doing great,
they're doing great.

284
00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:49.957
Hey listen, Scottie wants
to talk to you for a sec.

285
00:13:50.001 --> 00:13:51.480
Hi, Mom.

286
00:13:51.524 --> 00:13:52.588
Hi sweetheart, how
are you and your sister doing?

287
00:13:52.612 --> 00:13:54.483
Yeah, we're fine, we're fine.

288
00:13:54.527 --> 00:13:56.050
Okay good.

289
00:13:56.094 --> 00:13:58.618
Now listen, if your grandparents
need help around the house,

290
00:13:58.661 --> 00:14:00.272
you give them a hand, okay?

291
00:14:00.315 --> 00:14:01.423
And don't forget
to brush your teeth

292
00:14:01.447 --> 00:14:02.511
and wash up before you eat.

293
00:14:02.535 --> 00:14:03.841
Yeah, yeah, Mom, I got it.

294
00:14:03.884 --> 00:14:05.320
- I love you.
- Yeah, I gotta go.

295
00:14:05.364 --> 00:14:08.628
Wait, let me talk
to your grandparents.

296
00:14:08.671 --> 00:14:10.673
They're not here right now.

297
00:14:10.717 --> 00:14:12.719
They went to the store
to get some things.

298
00:14:12.762 --> 00:14:16.679
Okay, well, let
me talk to Uncle Joey.

299
00:14:16.723 --> 00:14:17.898
Hey.

300
00:14:17.942 --> 00:14:19.334
Are you sure it's no trouble?

301
00:14:19.378 --> 00:14:20.790
Oh, come on, it's
no problem at all.

302
00:14:20.814 --> 00:14:22.555
We're gonna have the
greatest weekend ever.

303
00:14:22.598 --> 00:14:23.686
Okay.

304
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:24.905
Bye.

305
00:14:25.775 --> 00:14:26.775
Good job.

306
00:14:32.565 --> 00:14:33.609
Hey Chief.

307
00:14:33.653 --> 00:14:34.697
Yeah.

308
00:14:36.264 --> 00:14:39.528
I mean, would it kill
him to smile and say hello?

309
00:14:39.572 --> 00:14:41.530
Well, hey, he's had
it a little rough.

310
00:14:41.574 --> 00:14:45.230
How about cutting him
a little slack, buddy?

311
00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.035
We could get
the boys and some beer?

312
00:14:48.059 --> 00:14:48.886
Boys, beer.

313
00:14:48.929 --> 00:14:50.365
Yes.

314
00:14:50.409 --> 00:14:51.279
We're about to go.

315
00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:52.541
Let's go somewhere soon.

316
00:14:52.585 --> 00:14:53.542
Wanna go fishing in-

317
00:14:53.586 --> 00:14:54.630
- Ladies.

318
00:14:54.674 --> 00:14:56.589
You know you can't park here.

319
00:14:56.632 --> 00:14:58.417
We're gonna move
sooner or later.

320
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.680
Well then do it.

321
00:15:00.723 --> 00:15:01.507
Don't get your panties

322
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:02.638
in a wad, chief.

323
00:15:03.726 --> 00:15:04.771
I heard that.

324
00:15:18.698 --> 00:15:20.395
All right kids.

325
00:15:20.439 --> 00:15:21.353
These two guys right here,

326
00:15:21.396 --> 00:15:22.547
these are the McKinley brothers.

327
00:15:22.571 --> 00:15:23.529
This is Mike and Travis.

328
00:15:23.572 --> 00:15:24.356
Howdy.

329
00:15:24.399 --> 00:15:25.618
Hey.

330
00:15:25.661 --> 00:15:26.943
This big guy over
here, that's Kimble.

331
00:15:26.967 --> 00:15:28.534
Call me Bull.

332
00:15:28.577 --> 00:15:30.294
Bull here used to be a
professional football player.

333
00:15:30.318 --> 00:15:31.667
From what I hear, he was the

334
00:15:31.711 --> 00:15:32.818
hardest hittin' linebacker
in the business.

335
00:15:32.842 --> 00:15:34.409
And that ain't no bull.

336
00:15:34.453 --> 00:15:36.759
This is Edward here.

337
00:15:36.803 --> 00:15:38.283
Good to make
your acquaintance.

338
00:15:38.326 --> 00:15:39.980
And this right here is Lisa.

339
00:15:40.024 --> 00:15:41.851
Hi, good to meet you.

340
00:15:41.895 --> 00:15:44.680
Hello, aren't you just adorable?

341
00:15:44.724 --> 00:15:46.291

342
00:15:47.596 --> 00:15:48.596
Lisa!

343
00:15:49.033 --> 00:15:50.643
Get over here.

344
00:15:56.605 --> 00:15:58.912
You guys, uh, wait right here.

345
00:15:58.956 --> 00:16:00.348
What's with the crossbow?

346
00:16:00.392 --> 00:16:01.654
Gotta eat, don't ya?

347
00:16:05.832 --> 00:16:10.837
Don't look at me like that.

348
00:16:11.533 --> 00:16:12.708
Are you kidding me?

349
00:16:12.752 --> 00:16:13.579
Look, I know we've
got rules, man.

350
00:16:13.622 --> 00:16:14.623
No, no, no.

351
00:16:14.667 --> 00:16:15.929
You look, okay.

352
00:16:15.973 --> 00:16:17.646
You know how important
these war games are to us.

353
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:19.585
All of us. I need this.

354
00:16:19.628 --> 00:16:20.890
Okay?

355
00:16:20.934 --> 00:16:21.804
Yeah, I know.

356
00:16:21.848 --> 00:16:23.043
Look, they won't get in the way.

357
00:16:23.067 --> 00:16:24.479
You won't even know
that they're here.

358
00:16:24.503 --> 00:16:25.903
Yeah, I better
not. For your sake.

359
00:16:25.939 --> 00:16:27.636
You got my word.

360
00:16:42.608 --> 00:16:43.739
Woo!

361
00:16:43.783 --> 00:16:46.046
Let's get this party started.

362
00:16:49.528 --> 00:16:50.964
Give me your bag.

363
00:16:51.878 --> 00:16:53.488
Hey, excuse me, stewardess.

364
00:16:53.532 --> 00:16:55.708
I'll be carrying my
suitcase on board with me.

365
00:16:55.751 --> 00:16:58.102
We don't have room
for you and your beer.

366
00:16:58.145 --> 00:16:59.538
That's fine.

367
00:16:59.581 --> 00:17:02.584
I'll just ride with
the kids and Joey.

368
00:17:10.462 --> 00:17:13.465
Officer Shoreman, come in.

369
00:17:14.814 --> 00:17:16.729
Go for Shoreman.

370
00:17:16.772 --> 00:17:18.470
What's your 20?

371
00:17:18.513 --> 00:17:19.906
Hi Betsy.

372
00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:22.822
I'm out here on Mount Holly
Road looking for trouble.

373
00:17:22.865 --> 00:17:23.929
Well, speaking of trouble,

374
00:17:23.953 --> 00:17:27.696
Chief Baumgardner
is lookin' for you.

375
00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.089
Now is he?

376
00:17:29.133 --> 00:17:30.656
How about telling
him I'm a little bit

377
00:17:30.699 --> 00:17:32.875
indisposed at the moment?

378
00:17:32.919 --> 00:17:35.704
I'll tell him but he
ain't gonna like it.

379
00:17:35.748 --> 00:17:37.880
Now, now Betsy,
you know he has a lot

380
00:17:37.924 --> 00:17:39.578
of trouble with his feelings

381
00:17:39.621 --> 00:17:41.710
and he's nothing at all like me.

382
00:17:42.711 --> 00:17:43.862
Well you could say that again.

383
00:17:43.886 --> 00:17:44.844
You've been showing
your feelings

384
00:17:44.887 --> 00:17:46.889
to every woman in town.

385
00:17:46.933 --> 00:17:51.024
- What can I say?
Women love the uniform.

386
00:17:55.855 --> 00:17:57.030
What's up?

387
00:17:57.074 --> 00:17:58.423
Get him.

388
00:17:58.466 --> 00:17:59.466
Get him!

389
00:18:01.774 --> 00:18:04.559
Don't you think it's
time for you to retire?

390
00:18:04.603 --> 00:18:05.865
Retire?

391
00:18:05.908 --> 00:18:07.736
They're gonna have
to pry my radar gun

392
00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.565
out of my cold, dead
hands before that happens.

393
00:18:10.609 --> 00:18:12.785
I have way too much
fun with this job.

394
00:18:13.873 --> 00:18:14.893
Speaking of fun,
I gotta go, Betsy.

395
00:18:14.917 --> 00:18:16.571
I got one flyin'.

396
00:18:18.007 --> 00:18:20.619
Driver, pull over to
the side of the road.

397
00:18:20.662 --> 00:18:21.837
Uh oh, no, no, no.

398
00:18:21.881 --> 00:18:23.622
No, you gotta be kiddin' me.

399
00:18:23.665 --> 00:18:24.884
Not right now.

400
00:18:24.927 --> 00:18:26.842
- Oh no.
- Come on, man.

401
00:18:26.886 --> 00:18:28.017
You need to pull over now.

402
00:18:28.061 --> 00:18:29.473
I ain't goin' back
to prison for nobody.

403
00:18:29.497 --> 00:18:30.605
- That's right.
- That's right.

404
00:18:30.629 --> 00:18:32.239
What are you talking about?

405
00:18:32.283 --> 00:18:34.850
I ain't goin' back
to prison for nobody.

406
00:18:34.894 --> 00:18:37.853
That violates my
parol, don't you think?

407
00:18:39.116 --> 00:18:40.136
And besides, nothing
good came out of prison

408
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.814
except meetin' you guys, man.

409
00:18:41.857 --> 00:18:42.965
Hey, whatever you
do, brother, I'm with you.

410
00:18:42.989 --> 00:18:44.512
Don't even worry about it.

411
00:18:44.556 --> 00:18:46.949
- You need to pull over!
- Would you shut up?

412
00:18:46.993 --> 00:18:48.603
Just shut up!

413
00:18:48.647 --> 00:18:51.606
And relax.

414
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:52.825
Everybody be cool, be cool.

415
00:18:52.868 --> 00:18:54.827
He dropped off, he
dropped, he dropped off.

416
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.176
We're good, we're good.

417
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.830
We're good.

418
00:18:57.873 --> 00:18:59.527
- All right.
- Let's roll, man.

419
00:18:59.571 --> 00:19:02.269
Sweetheart, you know
I love you, right?

420
00:19:02.313 --> 00:19:03.923
Huh? Get over here.

421
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.969
But don't you ever tell
me what to do again,

422
00:19:07.013 --> 00:19:08.013
you understand me?

423
00:19:11.844 --> 00:19:13.715
I run this ship!

424
00:19:13.759 --> 00:19:14.759
I run it!

425
00:19:21.027 --> 00:19:22.855
Dispatch, come in.

426
00:19:22.898 --> 00:19:24.944
Go for dispatch.

427
00:19:24.987 --> 00:19:26.293
Oh, hi Betsy.

428
00:19:26.337 --> 00:19:27.836
Hey, can you get George
to meet me out here

429
00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.645
on the far end of
Mount Holly Road?

430
00:19:30.689 --> 00:19:34.954
Donnie, don't tell me
you ran out of gas again.

431
00:19:34.997 --> 00:19:36.738
Yep.

432
00:19:59.239 --> 00:20:00.825
What happened to the
blue lights back there?

433
00:20:00.849 --> 00:20:02.851
Nothing to worry about.

434
00:20:02.895 --> 00:20:03.915
Call it divine intervention.

435
00:20:03.939 --> 00:20:05.680
Nobody's gonna mess
up our weekend!

436
00:20:05.724 --> 00:20:06.855
Huh?

437
00:20:08.248 --> 00:20:09.815
All right, here we go.

438
00:20:14.036 --> 00:20:15.212
Where's my girl?

439
00:20:15.255 --> 00:20:18.345
- I know you miss me.
- All right, all right.

440
00:20:18.389 --> 00:20:20.217
There's my sweetheart.

441
00:20:21.348 --> 00:20:22.175
Huh?

442
00:20:22.219 --> 00:20:23.219
Cool.

443
00:20:26.179 --> 00:20:27.311
Look at her.

444
00:20:31.315 --> 00:20:32.141
All right, Mike.

445
00:20:32.185 --> 00:20:33.230
Yep?

446
00:20:33.273 --> 00:20:34.970
- Bull.
- Got 'em, coach.

447
00:20:35.014 --> 00:20:36.014
Joey.

448
00:20:36.929 --> 00:20:37.930
Sebastian.

449
00:20:39.932 --> 00:20:40.932
Edward.

450
00:20:42.108 --> 00:20:44.066
- I got no service.
- Me, either.

451
00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:47.766
Oh, no you guys won't
get any reception out here.

452
00:20:47.809 --> 00:20:48.830
Well it's a good
thing I downloaded

453
00:20:48.854 --> 00:20:51.073
most of my music, so I'm good.

454
00:20:51.117 --> 00:20:52.901
Hey Scottie,
you ride with Sebastian.

455
00:20:52.945 --> 00:20:54.773
Jamie, you're with me.

456
00:20:56.078 --> 00:20:56.949
Hold on tight.

457
00:20:56.992 --> 00:20:58.255
It's gonna be a wild ride.

458
00:20:58.298 --> 00:21:00.735
You're gonna treat us
real good right there.

459
00:21:00.779 --> 00:21:01.779
Yeah.

460
00:21:02.346 --> 00:21:04.226
We're gonna be ridin'
or we're gonna be dyin'.

461
00:21:05.653 --> 00:21:07.351
All right. Get
up here all snug.

462
00:21:10.092 --> 00:21:12.921
She may not be the fastest,
but she's the safest.

463
00:21:26.979 --> 00:21:28.676
Yeah!

464
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.070
♪ Can't back out

465
00:21:31.113 --> 00:21:34.291
♪ 'Cause I'm two feet in

466
00:21:34.334 --> 00:21:36.902
♪ Eye on the ground

467
00:21:39.992 --> 00:21:42.777
♪ Water risin' higher

468
00:21:42.821 --> 00:21:45.780
♪ Not a root to bring

469
00:21:45.824 --> 00:21:48.305
♪ Ain't goin' under

470
00:21:48.348 --> 00:21:52.134
♪ Now you can't take me

471
00:22:02.188 --> 00:22:04.973
♪ I am the warrior

472
00:22:05.017 --> 00:22:08.063
♪ You are the warrior

473
00:22:08.107 --> 00:22:12.154
♪ We are the warriors

474
00:22:12.198 --> 00:22:15.810
♪ And we're about to win

475
00:22:25.211 --> 00:22:26.865
All right, listen
up! Listen up!

476
00:22:26.908 --> 00:22:28.214
Shut up, everybody shut up.

477
00:22:28.257 --> 00:22:29.041
Gather around, all right?

478
00:22:29.084 --> 00:22:30.695
This is how it works:

479
00:22:30.738 --> 00:22:34.089
the goal is to capture
the yellow flag as always.

480
00:22:34.133 --> 00:22:35.917
But this time it's
gonna be a lot harder.

481
00:22:35.961 --> 00:22:38.180
Whoa, what do you mean harder?

482
00:22:38.224 --> 00:22:39.375
Are you trying to make it harder

483
00:22:39.399 --> 00:22:40.313
because you're
tired of me winning

484
00:22:40.357 --> 00:22:41.706
or are you just tired of losing?

485
00:22:41.749 --> 00:22:42.944
Oh, brother, you sound
overconfident, beast.

486
00:22:42.968 --> 00:22:44.317
- What's up?
- No, no, no.

487
00:22:44.361 --> 00:22:45.425
I just didn't come
all the way out here

488
00:22:45.449 --> 00:22:47.059
to Redneckville to lose.

489
00:22:47.102 --> 00:22:48.365
Losin' ain't in my playbook.

490
00:22:48.408 --> 00:22:50.038
No you came out here
for the same reason

491
00:22:50.062 --> 00:22:51.846
all of us came out here for.

492
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:53.065
Yeah, and what's that?

493
00:22:53.108 --> 00:22:54.936
We like to hunt.

494
00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:56.300
So that just means
we love to kill

495
00:22:56.329 --> 00:22:59.376
and there's no greater
thrill than hunting humans.

496
00:22:59.419 --> 00:23:02.117
Of course we can't
actually kill people,

497
00:23:02.161 --> 00:23:03.791
but if you take a hit from
one of these paint guns,

498
00:23:03.815 --> 00:23:05.860
you're gonna wish you were dead.

499
00:23:05.904 --> 00:23:07.514
I've seen
paintball wars on TV.

500
00:23:07.558 --> 00:23:08.994
Doesn't look like
it hurts that bad.

501
00:23:09.037 --> 00:23:10.363
Yeah, well, a
normal paintball kit

502
00:23:10.387 --> 00:23:11.494
might feel like a bad bee sting,

503
00:23:11.518 --> 00:23:13.477
but these bad boys right here?

504
00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.522
You get tagged with one of these

505
00:23:15.566 --> 00:23:18.133
and it's gonna feel like you
were hit with a sledgehammer.

506
00:23:18.177 --> 00:23:20.962
Four years of college
didn't teach me much,

507
00:23:21.006 --> 00:23:22.287
but what it did
teach me was to apply

508
00:23:22.311 --> 00:23:25.924
what I have learned
to what interests me.

509
00:23:26.925 --> 00:23:28.317
I like to inflict pain.

510
00:23:30.102 --> 00:23:32.844
So I decided to take one of
these little CO2 cartridges

511
00:23:32.887 --> 00:23:35.150
and increase its
power by just a bit.

512
00:23:35.194 --> 00:23:37.936
I mean, to truly appreciate
it, you gotta see it.

513
00:23:37.979 --> 00:23:39.198
Hey Travis, start running.

514
00:23:39.241 --> 00:23:42.114
- What?
- I said start running.

515
00:23:42.157 --> 00:23:42.984
Yeah.

516
00:23:43.028 --> 00:23:43.811
Go get 'em, right?

517
00:23:43.855 --> 00:23:45.378
Go get 'em, yeah.

518
00:23:45.422 --> 00:23:46.466
- Come on, man.
- Yeah.

519
00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:47.902
- Come on.
- That's what's up!

520
00:23:49.556 --> 00:23:50.383
Will you stand down?

521
00:23:50.427 --> 00:23:51.210
Stand down.

522
00:23:51.253 --> 00:23:52.298
Come on!

523
00:23:53.125 --> 00:23:55.910
Come on, hot shot,
let's go! Come on!

524
00:23:55.954 --> 00:23:57.129
Come on, big boy!

525
00:23:57.172 --> 00:23:58.478
Come on!

526
00:23:58.522 --> 00:24:00.238
Let's see, you purty, but
can you get a purty shot?

527
00:24:00.262 --> 00:24:01.133
Let's give it to me!

528
00:24:01.176 --> 00:24:02.176
Hit me!

529
00:24:06.138 --> 00:24:08.009
Hey, Travis?

530
00:24:08.053 --> 00:24:09.924
Come on, wake up.

531
00:24:09.968 --> 00:24:10.968
Wake up.

532
00:24:12.536 --> 00:24:13.536
Wake up.

533
00:24:14.929 --> 00:24:16.148
How'd that feel?

534
00:24:16.191 --> 00:24:18.280
Um, it felt like I
got my butt kicked.

535
00:24:19.151 --> 00:24:21.153
That was awesome.

536
00:24:21.196 --> 00:24:23.024
All right, all
right, is he all right?

537
00:24:23.068 --> 00:24:24.330
Good, good, good.

538
00:24:24.373 --> 00:24:25.525
All right, back to what's
gonna happen tomorrow.

539
00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:27.115
To capture the yellow flag,

540
00:24:27.159 --> 00:24:28.528
not only do we have to
eliminate each other

541
00:24:28.552 --> 00:24:31.163
but there's another
team: a 10 man team

542
00:24:31.206 --> 00:24:33.513
made up of some of the
best from around the world,

543
00:24:33.557 --> 00:24:36.081
and they've already set up
their camp around the perimeter.

544
00:24:36.124 --> 00:24:38.300
They'll be wearing red armbands.

545
00:24:38.344 --> 00:24:40.041
They are professionals.

546
00:24:40.085 --> 00:24:42.130
They've never lost.

547
00:24:42.174 --> 00:24:44.132
But they haven't faced us.

548
00:24:44.176 --> 00:24:48.223
After we eliminate the Red
Team, then you're on your own.

549
00:24:48.267 --> 00:24:49.462
I wouldn't have
it any other way.

550
00:24:49.486 --> 00:24:50.965
That's what's up, baby.

551
00:24:51.009 --> 00:24:51.966
All right.

552
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:53.490
All right, let's go set up camp.

553
00:24:53.533 --> 00:24:57.319
We'll go check out the
rest of the terrain.

554
00:24:58.495 --> 00:25:00.975
Magazine is good,
but they are no good.

555
00:25:01.019 --> 00:25:02.542
Worthy adversary...

556
00:25:02.586 --> 00:25:04.152
Who's that?

557
00:25:04.196 --> 00:25:05.153
That?

558
00:25:05.197 --> 00:25:06.328
That's Sominski.

559
00:25:06.372 --> 00:25:09.201
He's their best.

560
00:25:09.244 --> 00:25:10.244
Look.

561
00:25:12.378 --> 00:25:14.293
It is Weekend Warriors.

562
00:25:22.431 --> 00:25:24.172
Pow.

563
00:25:56.204 --> 00:25:57.249
Hey, Uncle Joey?

564
00:25:57.292 --> 00:25:58.555
Yeah?

565
00:25:58.598 --> 00:26:00.358
Yeah, I don't think
Wesley likes us very much.

566
00:26:00.382 --> 00:26:02.297
Likes us? He hates us.

567
00:26:03.429 --> 00:26:05.431
Well, Wesley lost
his whole family

568
00:26:05.474 --> 00:26:06.911
when he was real young.

569
00:26:06.954 --> 00:26:08.695
He's been on his own ever since.

570
00:26:08.739 --> 00:26:11.655
You know, but don't mistake
that tough exterior.

571
00:26:11.698 --> 00:26:14.962
His IQ's off the charts,
just like his temper.

572
00:26:15.006 --> 00:26:16.311
He doesn't have a family?

573
00:26:16.355 --> 00:26:18.183
These guys are his family now.

574
00:26:18.226 --> 00:26:20.228
All right,
come on, let's get this.

575
00:26:20.272 --> 00:26:21.360
Them?

576
00:26:21.403 --> 00:26:22.729
Hey, give me that
hatchet, numb nuts.

577
00:26:22.753 --> 00:26:24.493
All right.

578
00:26:24.537 --> 00:26:27.061
Hatchet up something,
huh, tough boy?

579
00:26:27.105 --> 00:26:29.063
Well, I mean, what
about Sebastian?

580
00:26:29.107 --> 00:26:31.326
Well, Sebastian and I,
we're the new guys here.

581
00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:33.241
We don't really quite
fit in yet, but,

582
00:26:33.285 --> 00:26:34.349
you know, it's not
really about fitting in.

583
00:26:34.373 --> 00:26:35.592
It's about winning.

584
00:26:35.635 --> 00:26:36.984
Let's get in here.

585
00:26:37.028 --> 00:26:38.179
I'm gonna take care
of right now, brother.

586
00:26:38.203 --> 00:26:39.310
- Let's see.
- Come on, buddy.

587
00:26:39.334 --> 00:26:40.422
Come on!

588
00:26:46.515 --> 00:26:48.126
What's wrong with them?

589
00:26:49.475 --> 00:26:50.670
That's the McKinley Brothers.

590
00:26:50.694 --> 00:26:52.391
They're about as
country as it gets.

591
00:26:52.434 --> 00:26:53.435
Come on, come on!

592
00:26:53.479 --> 00:26:55.176
Let's go, let's go!

593
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.267
But you've never seen
brothers closer than these guys.

594
00:26:59.311 --> 00:27:00.399
And they're both crazy.

595
00:27:00.442 --> 00:27:02.314
Act like 10-year-olds,
but you know,

596
00:27:02.357 --> 00:27:03.663
if I was gonna go to war,

597
00:27:03.707 --> 00:27:06.274
I'd take them with
me every time.

598
00:27:06.318 --> 00:27:07.275
Them?

599
00:27:07.319 --> 00:27:08.276
Travis is real
good with blending

600
00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.582
into the woods there.

601
00:27:09.626 --> 00:27:11.255
Usually by the time you
see him, it's too late.

602
00:27:11.279 --> 00:27:13.412
And Mike? They call
him the sniper.

603
00:27:13.455 --> 00:27:16.110
He's the best shot in the state.

604
00:27:17.068 --> 00:27:19.244
And Edward back over there,

605
00:27:19.287 --> 00:27:20.680
he's a real smart guy,

606
00:27:20.724 --> 00:27:23.204
but I think he lacks what
it takes to be a leader,

607
00:27:23.248 --> 00:27:25.293
you know, he looks up to Wesley.

608
00:27:25.337 --> 00:27:28.122
Think that's why he follows
him around like a puppy.

609
00:27:28.166 --> 00:27:29.471
And Bull there, after the NFL,

610
00:27:29.515 --> 00:27:31.473
got himself into some trouble

611
00:27:31.517 --> 00:27:34.259
and ended up in prison
but that's where

612
00:27:34.302 --> 00:27:36.304
he met Wesley and
the brothers there.

613
00:27:36.348 --> 00:27:37.349
Here we are.

614
00:27:38.437 --> 00:27:43.007
So, we're uh, we're pretty
deep in the forest, right?

615
00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:44.269
- Yeah.
- Are they any, like,

616
00:27:44.312 --> 00:27:46.445
- wild animals around here?
- Yeah.

617
00:27:46.488 --> 00:27:49.622
Some wolves and coyotes
and mountain lions.

618
00:27:49.666 --> 00:27:53.017
And I've heard that there's
occasionally a grizzly bear.

619
00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.322
Grizzly bear?

620
00:27:54.366 --> 00:27:55.517
Yeah, but it's highly unlikely

621
00:27:55.541 --> 00:27:57.325
we're gonna come across one.

622
00:27:57.369 --> 00:27:59.414
Okay but like, what
happens if we do?

623
00:27:59.458 --> 00:28:01.373
Well, they're most
likely more scared of us

624
00:28:01.416 --> 00:28:02.548
than we are of them.

625
00:28:02.591 --> 00:28:05.029
Yeah, I wouldn't bet on it.

626
00:28:05.072 --> 00:28:07.161
Well, if we were
to see a grizzly bear

627
00:28:07.205 --> 00:28:08.728
and if one were
to try to attack,

628
00:28:08.772 --> 00:28:11.165
then what you do is
you pretend to be dead,

629
00:28:11.209 --> 00:28:12.403
because then they
get disinterested

630
00:28:12.427 --> 00:28:15.256
and they leave you alone.

631
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:18.042
See Scottie, even the
bear would be bored of you.

632
00:28:18.085 --> 00:28:19.130
Okay, hey, hey.

633
00:28:19.173 --> 00:28:20.348
We're good.

634
00:28:20.392 --> 00:28:21.586
She and I can take care
of the rest of this.

635
00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:22.394
You know how to use
one of these right here

636
00:28:22.437 --> 00:28:23.351
to start a fire?

637
00:28:23.395 --> 00:28:24.526
Oh yeah.

638
00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:25.721
All right. You're
in charge of the fire.

639
00:28:25.745 --> 00:28:27.529
You keep that on you.

640
00:28:27.573 --> 00:28:28.681
All right, you got all
your hooks latched?

641
00:28:28.705 --> 00:28:29.575
- Yep.
- Yeah?

642
00:28:29.618 --> 00:28:31.185
You got everything in there?

643
00:28:31.229 --> 00:28:34.101
All right, yep, undo
that and we'll zip it up.

644
00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:07.613
Damn,
that's some strong 'shine.

645
00:29:07.656 --> 00:29:08.745
Yeah.

646
00:29:08.788 --> 00:29:11.486
That's my grandpappy's recipe.

647
00:29:12.444 --> 00:29:14.185
Moonshine.

648
00:29:14.228 --> 00:29:17.101
Run in our blood.

649
00:29:17.144 --> 00:29:18.144
Yeah.

650
00:29:20.582 --> 00:29:23.237
Here's a gift
for you, princess.

651
00:29:23.281 --> 00:29:24.804
Bottom's up.

652
00:29:24.848 --> 00:29:26.501
Go on.

653
00:29:30.592 --> 00:29:32.812
You all right, Edward?

654
00:29:32.856 --> 00:29:36.642
Uh, that tastes like,
um, uh, Fireball candy.

655
00:29:39.166 --> 00:29:42.604
Speaking of candy, I got some.

656
00:29:42.648 --> 00:29:44.650
Anybody want some candy?

657
00:29:45.607 --> 00:29:46.783
I'll take some.

658
00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.568
Hey Wesley?

659
00:29:50.351 --> 00:29:54.486
Do you remember that
time we was in the yard

660
00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:56.705
and Big Ray come after me?

661
00:29:58.316 --> 00:29:59.708
I was there.

662
00:29:59.752 --> 00:30:01.798
Yeah, what happened?

663
00:30:01.841 --> 00:30:02.841
Well...

664
00:30:04.626 --> 00:30:09.631
Wesley cut off on Big Ray before
he could get to my brother

665
00:30:10.371 --> 00:30:12.547
and he put a beat on
him like I've never seen

666
00:30:12.591 --> 00:30:13.679
a man get beat.

667
00:30:15.376 --> 00:30:17.248
I thought he was dead.

668
00:30:18.815 --> 00:30:19.815
He lived.

669
00:30:20.904 --> 00:30:23.863
But he never bothered
me or any of us again.

670
00:30:23.907 --> 00:30:27.606
That's just what one
time Wesley saved us.

671
00:30:28.607 --> 00:30:32.611
I think I can speak
for all of us when I say

672
00:30:32.654 --> 00:30:36.310
we'd do anything for
that man right there.

673
00:30:36.354 --> 00:30:38.835
Yeah, I will drink to that.

674
00:30:42.012 --> 00:30:43.491
Nice, Uncle Joey.

675
00:30:43.535 --> 00:30:45.450
Those are some great
role models for us.

676
00:30:45.493 --> 00:30:47.321
They've all paid
their debt to society.

677
00:30:47.365 --> 00:30:50.411
Everybody makes
mistakes, all right?

678
00:31:00.726 --> 00:31:01.901
It's time.

679
00:31:01.945 --> 00:31:03.642
Kids, I think
it is time to get

680
00:31:03.685 --> 00:31:05.557
everything into the
tent and go to sleep.

681
00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.645
- Why?
What's happening.

682
00:31:06.688 --> 00:31:07.864
Don't worry about it.

683
00:31:07.907 --> 00:31:09.363
It's just a part of
the initiation for us,

684
00:31:09.387 --> 00:31:13.260
uh, so just, I think
it's time to go to bed.

685
00:31:13.304 --> 00:31:14.609
Let's go.

686
00:31:17.612 --> 00:31:18.396
Let's do it.

687
00:31:18.439 --> 00:31:19.439
Come on.

688
00:31:22.052 --> 00:31:23.575
Come on, get up.

689
00:31:24.402 --> 00:31:26.621
Oh guys, come on.

690
00:31:26.665 --> 00:31:28.449
Come on now, not
tonight. I'm too tired.

691
00:31:28.493 --> 00:31:29.668
Guys, come on.

692
00:31:29.711 --> 00:31:30.756
No.

693
00:31:31.844 --> 00:31:34.542
Let's just go to bed.

694
00:31:34.586 --> 00:31:35.674
Mike, come on.

695
00:31:35.717 --> 00:31:36.544
Bring it on, come on.

696
00:31:36.588 --> 00:31:37.850
Set him down.

697
00:31:40.374 --> 00:31:41.786
This brand is a symbol
of our brotherhood.

698
00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:43.725
Are you willing to
sacrifice your burning flesh

699
00:31:43.769 --> 00:31:45.553
to become part of our family?

700
00:31:47.425 --> 00:31:48.643
Wesley.

701
00:31:48.687 --> 00:31:49.688
Let me go.

702
00:31:52.778 --> 00:31:53.953
Let me go.

703
00:31:53.997 --> 00:31:56.303
Let him go.

704
00:31:58.305 --> 00:31:59.305
All right.

705
00:32:03.745 --> 00:32:04.659
That's it.

706
00:32:04.703 --> 00:32:05.922
Let's just get it over with.

707
00:32:05.965 --> 00:32:07.575
That's what I'm talkin' about.

708
00:32:07.619 --> 00:32:10.491
That's what I'm talkin' about.

709
00:32:10.535 --> 00:32:11.666
Give me a sip.

710
00:32:17.977 --> 00:32:18.977
All right.

711
00:32:20.632 --> 00:32:22.939
May we be heroes in this life

712
00:32:22.982 --> 00:32:24.766
and great warriors in death.

713
00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:25.874
- All right, just do it.
- Do it!

714
00:32:25.898 --> 00:32:26.681
- Come on.
- Do it!

715
00:32:26.725 --> 00:32:27.726
Come on.

716
00:32:27.769 --> 00:32:28.596
- Do it.
- Do it!

717
00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:29.640
Yeah, get him, get him.

718
00:32:36.996 --> 00:32:38.408
- You'll never be alone.
- That's it.

719
00:32:38.432 --> 00:32:39.888
We're your family
now, you understand?

720
00:32:39.912 --> 00:32:40.957
That's right.

721
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.088
That's right.

722
00:32:42.132 --> 00:32:43.132
Yeah!

723
00:32:44.395 --> 00:32:45.787
Look at me.

724
00:32:45.831 --> 00:32:48.007
Now you're a man, do
you understand me?

725
00:32:48.051 --> 00:32:50.009
You're one of us!

726
00:32:51.445 --> 00:32:52.969
That's it, that's it.

727
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:58.931
Have some of that.

728
00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:04.676
That's real 'shine right there.

729
00:33:05.982 --> 00:33:07.722
I gotta go pee.

730
00:33:07.766 --> 00:33:08.723
Yeah?

731
00:33:08.767 --> 00:33:09.811
Okay.

732
00:33:10.682 --> 00:33:11.726
I'ma turn in.

733
00:33:12.771 --> 00:33:14.120
Okay.

734
00:33:14.164 --> 00:33:16.079
You know I love you, right?

735
00:33:16.122 --> 00:33:18.907
I love you too, Wesley.

736
00:34:09.088 --> 00:34:10.088
Lisa.

737
00:34:10.785 --> 00:34:12.787
What happened to you?

738
00:34:12.831 --> 00:34:15.747
What are you talking about?

739
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:17.072
There are marks
all over your back

740
00:34:17.096 --> 00:34:18.054
and I know they're not from me.

741
00:34:18.097 --> 00:34:19.446
Who did this?

742
00:34:20.752 --> 00:34:23.624
- Are you cheating on me?
- No.

743
00:34:23.668 --> 00:34:25.844
- Hey.
- Who did this to you?

744
00:34:28.847 --> 00:34:31.719
I, I was walking
back from the woods.

745
00:34:34.157 --> 00:34:35.157
Who's there?

746
00:34:38.552 --> 00:34:42.687
And, and then he just
came out of nowhere.

747
00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:44.080
What?

748
00:34:44.123 --> 00:34:47.126
I asked him to stop,
but he was so strong.

749
00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:48.736
What are you talking about?

750
00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.738
I did everything I could.

751
00:34:50.782 --> 00:34:52.784
Who did this to you?

752
00:34:55.482 --> 00:34:56.482
Joey.

753
00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.945
All right, so...

754
00:35:27.645 --> 00:35:28.820
Here's your map.

755
00:35:31.562 --> 00:35:32.669
- I know you're gonna win.
- Yeah?

756
00:35:32.693 --> 00:35:34.782
All right? I'm
rootin' for you.

757
00:35:34.826 --> 00:35:35.827
Where's Joey at?

758
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:36.915
Um...

759
00:35:38.003 --> 00:35:39.198
Well Joey, Sebastian,
and the kids,

760
00:35:39.222 --> 00:35:40.851
I think they left about
a half an hour ago?

761
00:35:40.875 --> 00:35:41.876
Yeah?

762
00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.878
Everything cool?

763
00:35:48.013 --> 00:35:51.538
So the Red Team's perimeter
is here, and we are here.

764
00:35:51.582 --> 00:35:54.019
The yellow flag is
just over the ridge here.

765
00:35:54.062 --> 00:35:54.976
Okay.

766
00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:55.803
All right.

767
00:35:55.847 --> 00:35:57.544
Okay, great, okay.

768
00:35:57.588 --> 00:35:59.807
You kids, go wait on that
ridge right over there.

769
00:35:59.851 --> 00:36:00.895
You should be able to see

770
00:36:00.939 --> 00:36:01.592
all the action from
there, all right?

771
00:36:01.635 --> 00:36:02.810
Cool.

772
00:36:02.854 --> 00:36:03.855
All right.

773
00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:06.640
Hey.

774
00:36:06.684 --> 00:36:08.294
Can I borrow that?

775
00:36:09.991 --> 00:36:13.517
Okay, but, promise
you won't break it?

776
00:36:14.213 --> 00:36:15.997
I promise.

777
00:36:16.041 --> 00:36:17.912
I got a great
collection of music,

778
00:36:17.956 --> 00:36:19.107
some I even think you'll like.

779
00:36:19.131 --> 00:36:20.131
Sweet.

780
00:36:22.874 --> 00:36:24.963
Hey Sebastian?

781
00:36:25.006 --> 00:36:26.225
Good luck.

782
00:36:26.269 --> 00:36:28.053
You're the one
that's gonna need it.

783
00:36:39.064 --> 00:36:42.023
- Look, it's the flag.
- It means I won.

784
00:36:42.067 --> 00:36:43.111
No it doesn't.

785
00:36:43.155 --> 00:36:45.679
All right, top of
the hill's up here.

786
00:37:02.087 --> 00:37:04.655
All right. I see you.

787
00:37:41.039 --> 00:37:42.910
Hello, Edward.

788
00:37:42.954 --> 00:37:44.651
I'll see you soon.

789
00:37:46.131 --> 00:37:47.001
I see you, Blue!

790
00:37:47.045 --> 00:37:48.089
I see you!

791
00:37:58.752 --> 00:38:01.059
So your team's
undefeated, huh?

792
00:38:02.321 --> 00:38:03.321
Not anymore.

793
00:38:05.455 --> 00:38:06.760
Hey.

794
00:38:06.804 --> 00:38:08.762
Says in the Paintball
Wars handbook,

795
00:38:08.806 --> 00:38:11.287
no physical contact
with the opponent.

796
00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:12.375
Oh does it now?

797
00:38:12.418 --> 00:38:14.812
Yeah.

798
00:38:14.855 --> 00:38:16.030
Chapter two, page eight.

799
00:38:16.074 --> 00:38:17.423
Chapter two, page eight?

800
00:38:19.686 --> 00:38:20.686
Hm.

801
00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.823
I must've skipped that page.

802
00:38:33.134 --> 00:38:36.050
Do we have anyone left
out on the field at all?

803
00:38:36.094 --> 00:38:36.964
Only one, sir.

804
00:38:37.008 --> 00:38:37.965
Sominski.

805
00:38:38.009 --> 00:38:39.445
Sominski.

806
00:38:39.489 --> 00:38:40.968
He's the best.

807
00:38:41.012 --> 00:38:43.188
They won't ever catch him.

808
00:38:43.231 --> 00:38:45.233
I just say get
him on the radio.

809
00:38:45.277 --> 00:38:48.976
Sominski, this is
team leader, copy.

810
00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:50.151
Sominski.

811
00:38:50.195 --> 00:38:52.893
This is team
leader. Do you copy?

812
00:38:53.894 --> 00:38:57.158
Sominiski, this is team
leader, do you copy?

813
00:38:57.202 --> 00:39:00.336
Red Team leader,
this is Sominski. Over.

814
00:39:00.379 --> 00:39:03.077
Has your position
been compromised at all?

815
00:39:03.121 --> 00:39:05.341
Negative Red Team leader.

816
00:39:05.384 --> 00:39:07.255
I have target in sight.

817
00:39:08.344 --> 00:39:09.954
Watch out for those rednecks.

818
00:39:09.997 --> 00:39:11.129
They're bloody good.

819
00:39:12.173 --> 00:39:13.914
Don't worry.

820
00:39:13.958 --> 00:39:16.134
They never find me.

821
00:39:23.054 --> 00:39:24.185
Hello.

822
00:39:24.229 --> 00:39:25.229
Hello?

823
00:39:26.057 --> 00:39:27.798
Who is this?

824
00:39:27.841 --> 00:39:30.278
Yeah, this is the rednecks.

825
00:39:30.322 --> 00:39:32.368
I just wanted to
call and inform you

826
00:39:32.411 --> 00:39:34.761
that we have captured
your last soldier.

827
00:39:34.805 --> 00:39:36.023
Thank you for playin'.

828
00:39:36.067 --> 00:39:37.155
Oh.

829
00:39:37.198 --> 00:39:38.852
You can go home now.

830
00:39:50.473 --> 00:39:51.473
Wow, look.

831
00:39:52.431 --> 00:39:53.998
Oh-ho, cool.

832
00:39:54.041 --> 00:39:55.913
Uncle Joey told me about this.

833
00:39:55.956 --> 00:39:57.958
What does it mean?

834
00:39:58.002 --> 00:40:00.047
It means that they've
beaten the Red Team now

835
00:40:00.091 --> 00:40:01.547
and they're on their
own to fight each other.

836
00:40:01.571 --> 00:40:03.877
We should be able to see
everything from here.

837
00:40:03.921 --> 00:40:05.096
Cool.

838
00:40:21.808 --> 00:40:24.463
It's you and me.

839
00:40:24.507 --> 00:40:27.118
We're the last two left.

840
00:40:49.183 --> 00:40:50.184
Woo.

841
00:40:51.229 --> 00:40:52.535
- Yes!
- Yeah.

842
00:40:52.578 --> 00:40:53.578
Yes!

843
00:40:54.972 --> 00:40:56.147
You're so dead.

844
00:41:01.369 --> 00:41:02.370
No, you're dead.

845
00:41:28.527 --> 00:41:30.050
What happened?

846
00:41:31.312 --> 00:41:32.357
Justice.

847
00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.552
What are you talkin' about?

848
00:41:33.576 --> 00:41:34.925
He forced himself
on Lisa, man.

849
00:41:34.968 --> 00:41:36.622
He got what he deserved.

850
00:41:46.632 --> 00:41:48.373
He's dead.

851
00:41:55.162 --> 00:41:58.122
I didn't like him anyway.

852
00:42:02.169 --> 00:42:03.169
Hm.

853
00:42:04.302 --> 00:42:06.217
So what do we do now?

854
00:42:08.567 --> 00:42:11.178
We can say it was an accident.

855
00:42:11.222 --> 00:42:13.354
An accident?

856
00:42:13.398 --> 00:42:14.398
No.

857
00:42:15.269 --> 00:42:17.117
I'll be back in jail so fast
it'll make your head swim

858
00:42:17.141 --> 00:42:19.578
and I'm definitely
not going back there.

859
00:42:19.622 --> 00:42:21.362
Then what?

860
00:42:21.406 --> 00:42:24.017
Nobody knows we're
out here but us,

861
00:42:24.061 --> 00:42:28.544
so we'll just bury the body
where nobody can find it.

862
00:42:28.587 --> 00:42:31.634
What about those two brats?

863
00:42:31.677 --> 00:42:35.246
Oh, we'll have to
get rid of them, too.

864
00:42:35.289 --> 00:42:36.682
What?

865
00:42:36.726 --> 00:42:38.510
You've gotta think this through.

866
00:42:38.554 --> 00:42:40.556
This is not a good idea.

867
00:42:42.688 --> 00:42:45.343
I ain't killin' no
innocent kids. No way.

868
00:42:47.388 --> 00:42:49.390
Where's your loyalty, man?

869
00:42:49.434 --> 00:42:50.653
With you.

870
00:42:50.696 --> 00:42:52.132
I mean with us.

871
00:42:54.134 --> 00:42:55.396
Right answer.

872
00:42:58.443 --> 00:43:00.576
Yeah, yeah, let's
go. Come on, come on.

873
00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.360
Come on, let's go.

874
00:43:06.277 --> 00:43:07.670
Come on.

875
00:43:10.542 --> 00:43:13.240
They've seen everything.

876
00:43:13.284 --> 00:43:14.285
Get 'em!

877
00:43:25.992 --> 00:43:26.602
Which way?

878
00:43:26.645 --> 00:43:28.125
Come on.

879
00:43:56.588 --> 00:43:58.677
Wait, wait, wait.

880
00:43:58.721 --> 00:43:59.983
Get 'em!

881
00:44:00.026 --> 00:44:01.637
You hear that?

882
00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:02.701
They're close, we have
to hide, we have to hide.

883
00:44:02.725 --> 00:44:03.682
Let's go, come on.

884
00:44:03.726 --> 00:44:08.469
Come on.

885
00:44:20.177 --> 00:44:22.092
I got you now.

886
00:44:30.187 --> 00:44:31.057
You all right?

887
00:44:31.101 --> 00:44:33.146
- Yeah.
- You okay?

888
00:44:38.848 --> 00:44:41.372
All right, come on, we gotta go.

889
00:44:48.596 --> 00:44:49.596
Hey Mike!

890
00:44:50.511 --> 00:44:51.687
Yeah?

891
00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:53.079
Did you get 'em?

892
00:44:53.123 --> 00:44:55.516
You better get
over here, brother.

893
00:45:02.567 --> 00:45:03.350
No, no.

894
00:45:03.394 --> 00:45:04.743
No.

895
00:45:08.616 --> 00:45:10.053
Wake up.

896
00:45:10.096 --> 00:45:11.096
Wake up.

897
00:45:12.229 --> 00:45:13.229
Wake up.

898
00:45:14.448 --> 00:45:16.320
No, brother, wake up.

899
00:45:16.363 --> 00:45:17.713
Wake up, buddy.

900
00:45:17.756 --> 00:45:19.453
Innocent kids, huh?

901
00:45:30.334 --> 00:45:32.249
I'm gonna kill those kids.

902
00:45:33.641 --> 00:45:34.860
Wake up, brother.

903
00:45:34.904 --> 00:45:35.904
Wake up.

904
00:45:37.471 --> 00:45:38.559
He's not dead.

905
00:45:38.603 --> 00:45:39.603
No, no.

906
00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:43.564
Travis!

907
00:45:44.522 --> 00:45:45.522
Travis!

908
00:45:57.448 --> 00:45:59.885
We need to get warm.

909
00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:04.237
I'm gonna grab some fire wood.

910
00:46:04.281 --> 00:46:06.109
Okay, hurry. Please.

911
00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:42.727
♪ Happy birthday to you

912
00:47:44.555 --> 00:47:46.557
Go on, make a wish.

913
00:47:47.645 --> 00:47:48.428
Yay.

914
00:47:48.472 --> 00:47:49.473
All right.

915
00:47:51.388 --> 00:47:52.606
A survival knife?

916
00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:53.932
Yeah, I had one
when I was a kid.

917
00:47:53.956 --> 00:47:58.308
Not only is it super cool,
it's incredibly handy.

918
00:47:58.351 --> 00:47:59.309
Thanks, Dad.

919
00:47:59.352 --> 00:48:00.745
You're welcome.

920
00:48:00.788 --> 00:48:04.357
All right already,
now let's have some cake.

921
00:48:54.625 --> 00:48:56.627
This is for you, brother.

922
00:49:08.813 --> 00:49:10.641
I love you, brother.

923
00:50:11.136 --> 00:50:13.878
You know what we need to do.

924
00:50:16.837 --> 00:50:18.709
We pledge vengeance.

925
00:50:23.844 --> 00:50:26.804
I'm gonna kill those
murderin' kids for my brother.

926
00:50:26.847 --> 00:50:28.066
That's right.

927
00:50:30.547 --> 00:50:34.464
Prepare yourselves tonight.
We leave at sun up.

928
00:50:36.901 --> 00:50:37.901
Wesley.

929
00:50:39.208 --> 00:50:41.688
Do you honestly think we're
gonna be able to find them?

930
00:50:41.732 --> 00:50:44.909
I mean, there's like a
million places they can hide.

931
00:50:44.952 --> 00:50:47.564
Yeah, we'll find 'em.

932
00:50:47.607 --> 00:50:48.869
We might not find 'em alive.

933
00:50:48.913 --> 00:50:50.151
With these temperatures
and the wildlife,

934
00:50:50.175 --> 00:50:53.700
they'll be lucky to make
it through the night.

935
00:50:56.573 --> 00:50:57.573
Hey.

936
00:50:58.575 --> 00:51:00.011
What about Joey's body?

937
00:51:00.055 --> 00:51:01.708
Edward, get over here.

938
00:51:01.752 --> 00:51:02.927
Get over here!

939
00:51:04.929 --> 00:51:05.930
What's up?

940
00:51:05.973 --> 00:51:07.168
You and Edward
go bury the body

941
00:51:07.192 --> 00:51:09.455
where nobody can find it.

942
00:51:17.811 --> 00:51:18.811
Let's go.

943
00:51:43.794 --> 00:51:44.925
You need to sleep.

944
00:51:44.969 --> 00:51:46.971
I can't. I'm scared.

945
00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:49.190
I am, too.

946
00:51:51.584 --> 00:51:53.891
We're gonna be okay.

947
00:51:53.934 --> 00:51:54.934
Here.

948
00:51:55.849 --> 00:51:57.068
Pray with me.

949
00:51:57.112 --> 00:51:59.897
We need all the help we can get.

950
00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:03.770
Dear Lord, please help Jamie
and I to make it home safe.

951
00:52:03.814 --> 00:52:06.077
And please help our mom.

952
00:52:06.121 --> 00:52:09.559
She's probably worried
to death by now.

953
00:52:10.995 --> 00:52:14.955
I know Uncle Joey is up
there with you and Dad now.

954
00:52:14.999 --> 00:52:18.133
And tell him we don't blame
him for what happened,

955
00:52:18.176 --> 00:52:19.960
and that we miss him.

956
00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:25.792
Although we're scared,

957
00:52:25.836 --> 00:52:29.492
our dad taught us
in times of darkness

958
00:52:29.535 --> 00:52:32.103
that we recite
the Lord's Prayer.

959
00:52:34.105 --> 00:52:35.106
Thanks, Dad.

960
00:52:37.848 --> 00:52:39.806
So here it goes.

961
00:52:39.850 --> 00:52:42.113
Our Father, who art in Heaven,

962
00:52:42.157 --> 00:52:44.115
hallowed be thy name.

963
00:52:44.159 --> 00:52:47.553
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

964
00:52:47.597 --> 00:52:49.816
on earth as it is in Heaven.

965
00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:53.080
Give us this day
our daily bread...

966
00:52:53.124 --> 00:52:54.821
And forgive us our tres...

967
00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:33.033
Hey this is Joey.

968
00:53:33.077 --> 00:53:34.861
You know what to do.

969
00:53:34.905 --> 00:53:35.949
Hey, Joey, it's Peggy.

970
00:53:35.993 --> 00:53:37.690
Um, you're going
straight to voicemail

971
00:53:37.734 --> 00:53:38.972
and Mom and Dad
aren't picking up.

972
00:53:38.996 --> 00:53:40.563
Can you give me a call, please?

973
00:53:40.606 --> 00:53:42.042
Just getting a little worried.

974
00:53:42.086 --> 00:53:43.086
Thank you.

975
00:54:01.061 --> 00:54:02.149
What do we do now?

976
00:54:02.193 --> 00:54:05.065
Well, the best thing to do is

977
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:09.722
keep as much space between
us and Wesley as possible.

978
00:54:11.158 --> 00:54:12.638
Where'd you get that?

979
00:54:12.682 --> 00:54:15.119
Oh, I got it from
Uncle Joey's tent.

980
00:54:15.162 --> 00:54:16.773
Good thing I did.

981
00:54:18.818 --> 00:54:20.733
There should be a highway
right over the hill.

982
00:54:20.777 --> 00:54:21.777
Let's go.

983
00:54:30.003 --> 00:54:31.309
They're close.

984
00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:34.965
All right, let's go. Come on.

985
00:54:40.884 --> 00:54:42.102
So, according to the map,

986
00:54:42.146 --> 00:54:44.627
the road should be
right down here.

987
00:54:51.764 --> 00:54:53.288
What highway? I
don't see a highway.

988
00:54:53.331 --> 00:54:54.985
God!

989
00:54:55.028 --> 00:54:58.858
This highway looks like it
hasn't been used in forever.

990
00:55:02.471 --> 00:55:04.168
It was on the map.

991
00:55:05.735 --> 00:55:07.780
Maybe we'll just wait and
then we can get lucky.

992
00:55:07.824 --> 00:55:09.956
Or we can just stay
here and die of old age.

993
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.306
All right, okay?

994
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:14.744
I just gotta think
of something else.

995
00:55:14.787 --> 00:55:16.136
All right, uh...

996
00:55:17.442 --> 00:55:19.357
What if we just follow the road.

997
00:55:19.401 --> 00:55:21.141
And then we have to
run into somebody.

998
00:55:21.185 --> 00:55:23.405
Yeah, they call themselves
the Weekend Warriors.

999
00:55:23.448 --> 00:55:25.015
That's a bad idea.

1000
00:55:25.058 --> 00:55:28.366
That's the first place
they'll look for us.

1001
00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:31.891
Well, I mean, you are right.

1002
00:55:34.503 --> 00:55:37.723
The best thing we can
do is to stay together

1003
00:55:37.767 --> 00:55:39.986
and get off the road.

1004
00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:41.030
Let's go.

1005
00:55:57.134 --> 00:55:58.135
Hey yo Wesley!

1006
00:55:58.178 --> 00:55:59.179
What's up?

1007
00:56:00.355 --> 00:56:02.182
Looks like they
gone into the river.

1008
00:56:02.226 --> 00:56:04.402
They're trying to
cover their tracks.

1009
00:56:04.446 --> 00:56:06.143
Ain't no tellin' when
they'll come out.

1010
00:56:06.186 --> 00:56:08.188
- All right, look here.
We need to split up.

1011
00:56:08.232 --> 00:56:10.036
Sebastian, you go straight
and you keep to the right

1012
00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:12.279
and don't let 'em get by you.

1013
00:56:12.323 --> 00:56:13.803
Bull, you take the
terrain up there.

1014
00:56:13.846 --> 00:56:15.065
It's not that rough.

1015
00:56:15.108 --> 00:56:16.216
The water's gonna push 'em back.

1016
00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:18.024
It's gonna help us catch 'em.

1017
00:56:18.068 --> 00:56:19.156
I'm on it!

1018
00:56:19.199 --> 00:56:20.263
Me and Mike are
gonna take the river,

1019
00:56:20.287 --> 00:56:21.526
and you and Lisa,
you cross the creek

1020
00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:22.812
and you stay to the left,

1021
00:56:22.855 --> 00:56:26.076
and do not let them get by you.

1022
00:56:39.219 --> 00:56:40.219
Let's go.

1023
00:56:54.017 --> 00:56:55.410
You know we can't
do this, right?

1024
00:56:55.453 --> 00:56:57.412
Yeah, I know, just...

1025
00:56:57.455 --> 00:57:00.545
Look, we have to play
along or we're all dead.

1026
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:03.374
Sooner or later we're
gonna catch up to those kids,

1027
00:57:03.418 --> 00:57:05.071
and then what?

1028
00:57:05.115 --> 00:57:07.073
I don't know, I don't know.

1029
00:57:07.117 --> 00:57:08.553
I'll think of somethin'.

1030
00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.389
Follow me, they're coming.

1031
00:57:18.433 --> 00:57:21.087
Look. There they are.

1032
00:57:21.131 --> 00:57:22.219
Wait, guys.

1033
00:57:23.307 --> 00:57:24.090
Wait.

1034
00:57:24.134 --> 00:57:25.135
We won't hurt you.

1035
00:57:35.014 --> 00:57:36.320
Shoot 'em.

1036
00:57:36.363 --> 00:57:37.843
Hey, hey kid, hey.

1037
00:57:37.887 --> 00:57:38.496
Hey, hey.

1038
00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:39.541
Hey, no.

1039
00:57:39.584 --> 00:57:40.542
Come on.

1040
00:57:40.585 --> 00:57:41.891
Come with us.

1041
00:57:42.935 --> 00:57:44.241
This?

1042
00:57:44.284 --> 00:57:45.372
Don't worry about this.

1043
00:57:45.416 --> 00:57:46.896
That's nothing, all right?

1044
00:57:46.939 --> 00:57:48.201
Come on.

1045
00:57:48.245 --> 00:57:52.902
Just come with us and
you'll be safe, I promise.

1046
00:57:56.296 --> 00:57:57.296
Come on.

1047
00:58:19.232 --> 00:58:20.407
Hey Scottie!

1048
00:58:22.322 --> 00:58:23.933
Say your prayers!

1049
00:58:25.282 --> 00:58:27.327
You gave me no choice.

1050
00:58:43.126 --> 00:58:44.867
No, no!

1051
00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:46.129
Come on, hey, come on.

1052
00:58:46.172 --> 00:58:48.087
We can make it,
come on! Come on.

1053
00:58:49.262 --> 00:58:51.221
They shot me.

1054
00:58:51.264 --> 00:58:52.962
No, come on, we can make it.

1055
00:58:53.005 --> 00:58:53.571
Run.

1056
00:58:53.615 --> 00:58:54.615
Run!

1057
00:59:08.543 --> 00:59:11.284
Look what you made me do!

1058
00:59:11.328 --> 00:59:12.372
Get 'em.

1059
00:59:34.612 --> 00:59:36.396
Hey, Chief?

1060
00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:37.572
You have three messages.

1061
00:59:37.615 --> 00:59:38.964
Copper Bell?

1062
00:59:39.008 --> 00:59:40.072
Did they get my
special 'shine in?

1063
00:59:40.096 --> 00:59:41.227
No.

1064
00:59:41.271 --> 00:59:42.489
Oh.

1065
00:59:42.533 --> 00:59:44.274
Oh, no, don't tell
me, Mrs. Hollaway?

1066
00:59:44.317 --> 00:59:45.623
What's she want now?

1067
00:59:45.667 --> 00:59:47.277
She said that
some kids snuck in

1068
00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:48.583
and stole some apples.

1069
00:59:48.626 --> 00:59:50.933
It was like a bushel of
apples from her orchard.

1070
00:59:50.976 --> 00:59:52.214
What do you want me to tell her?

1071
00:59:52.238 --> 00:59:53.239
I don't know, Joyce.

1072
00:59:53.283 --> 00:59:54.303
Tell her, tell her
I don't have time

1073
00:59:54.327 --> 00:59:56.634
to be chasin' apple bandits.

1074
00:59:56.678 --> 00:59:57.461
I don't know.

1075
00:59:57.504 --> 00:59:58.418
Make up somethin'.

1076
00:59:58.462 --> 01:00:00.072
- Okay.
- No, no.

1077
01:00:00.116 --> 01:00:02.988
Joyce, she's just gonna
call back again, isn't she?

1078
01:00:03.032 --> 01:00:05.730
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay, tell her...

1079
01:00:05.774 --> 01:00:08.167
Tell her I'll be out
there tomorrow morning.

1080
01:00:08.211 --> 01:00:10.126
I'm sure she will
love to hear that.

1081
01:00:10.169 --> 01:00:15.174
And Joyce, have you seen
those Montgomery files anywhere?

1082
01:00:15.479 --> 01:00:16.479
What?

1083
01:00:17.699 --> 01:00:19.352
Oh boy.

1084
01:00:19.396 --> 01:00:22.442
Should probably slow
down on the 'shine, buddy.

1085
01:00:22.486 --> 01:00:23.487
Copy that.

1086
01:00:24.488 --> 01:00:25.488
Mm-hm.

1087
01:00:44.334 --> 01:00:46.205
- Hey, can I help you?
- I need some help.

1088
01:00:46.249 --> 01:00:47.313
I need to speak with
a police officer.

1089
01:00:47.337 --> 01:00:48.294
Oh, over here at the window.

1090
01:00:48.338 --> 01:00:49.402
- They can help you.
- Thank you.

1091
01:00:49.426 --> 01:00:50.340
Excuse me?

1092
01:00:50.383 --> 01:00:51.646
Excuse me, I need some help.

1093
01:00:51.689 --> 01:00:53.299
Okay, give me a minute.

1094
01:00:53.343 --> 01:00:54.126
Are you okay?

1095
01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:55.214
Give you a minute?

1096
01:00:55.258 --> 01:00:56.607
My kids are missing.

1097
01:00:56.651 --> 01:00:59.001
Hey, can you come over
here and help her right now?

1098
01:00:59.044 --> 01:01:00.437
Okay, uh, what's this about?

1099
01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:03.396
I just said my
kids are missing.

1100
01:01:04.659 --> 01:01:06.375
I'm sorry, excuse me,
what's going on here?

1101
01:01:06.399 --> 01:01:07.313
My two kids.

1102
01:01:07.357 --> 01:01:08.706
I don't know where they are.

1103
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:10.162
I went by my parents' house,
there was nobody there,

1104
01:01:10.186 --> 01:01:11.424
I went by the neighbor's house.

1105
01:01:11.448 --> 01:01:13.276
They said the house has
been vacant for days.

1106
01:01:13.319 --> 01:01:14.407
Chief, you want me to take

1107
01:01:14.451 --> 01:01:16.322
- the report on this one?
- No, I got it.

1108
01:01:16.366 --> 01:01:17.584
What are their names?

1109
01:01:17.628 --> 01:01:19.325
Scottie and Jamie Kendall.

1110
01:01:19.369 --> 01:01:20.413
What are their ages?

1111
01:01:20.457 --> 01:01:23.373
Can you tell me what
they were wearing?

1112
01:01:23.416 --> 01:01:26.593
Scottie is 14 and Jamie's 10.

1113
01:01:26.637 --> 01:01:28.291
Um...

1114
01:01:28.334 --> 01:01:31.163
I think Scottie was wearing
green cargo pants and uh,

1115
01:01:31.207 --> 01:01:32.774
uh, a blue shirt
and a gray hoodie

1116
01:01:32.817 --> 01:01:35.602
and he had his black
baseball cap on.

1117
01:01:35.646 --> 01:01:40.085
Um, Jamie was wearing black
pants and a purple sweater.

1118
01:01:40.129 --> 01:01:41.478
All right, got it.

1119
01:01:41.521 --> 01:01:43.306
Just calm down now.

1120
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:45.264
Now when was the last
time you saw 'em?

1121
01:01:45.308 --> 01:01:46.851
It's been two days
since Joey picked 'em up.

1122
01:01:46.875 --> 01:01:48.137
Who's Joey?

1123
01:01:48.790 --> 01:01:50.705
He's my brother.

1124
01:01:50.748 --> 01:01:51.618
All right.

1125
01:01:51.662 --> 01:01:52.837
So Joey picked 'em up.

1126
01:01:52.881 --> 01:01:54.554
Can you describe the
vehicle he was driving?

1127
01:01:54.578 --> 01:01:58.408
He's um, he's driving
a white Jeep with big tires.

1128
01:01:58.451 --> 01:02:00.715
A white Jeep with big tires?

1129
01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:08.200
What's your name?

1130
01:02:08.244 --> 01:02:09.680
Peggy Kendall.

1131
01:02:09.724 --> 01:02:11.464
I'm their mom.

1132
01:02:11.508 --> 01:02:14.380
All right, well,
Peggy Kendall, come on.

1133
01:02:14.424 --> 01:02:17.644
- Let's figure this out.
- Thank you.

1134
01:02:23.259 --> 01:02:24.453
Excuse me, ma'am,
would you describe

1135
01:02:24.477 --> 01:02:27.350
that car again, please?

1136
01:02:42.278 --> 01:02:44.541
Wow, look at it.

1137
01:02:44.584 --> 01:02:45.716
Nice.

1138
01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:46.760
Come on.

1139
01:02:52.592 --> 01:02:54.333
Ha, looks like your room.

1140
01:02:54.377 --> 01:02:55.726
Very funny.

1141
01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:59.686
All right, let's look
around for stuff we can use.

1142
01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:03.821
Oh-oh, sweet, lima
beans and corn.

1143
01:03:03.865 --> 01:03:05.257
You know, I never thought I'd be

1144
01:03:05.301 --> 01:03:08.130
this excited about
lima beans and corn.

1145
01:03:10.915 --> 01:03:13.657
Oh sleeping bag, I love you.

1146
01:03:16.965 --> 01:03:18.314
What? What is it?

1147
01:03:18.357 --> 01:03:19.141
It's in my leg.

1148
01:03:19.184 --> 01:03:20.184
What is?

1149
01:03:21.273 --> 01:03:22.579
- Rat!
- Oh!

1150
01:03:22.622 --> 01:03:23.493
- Get it off, get it off!
- What, what?

1151
01:03:23.536 --> 01:03:24.146
What do you want me to do?

1152
01:03:24.189 --> 01:03:25.277
Just kill it!

1153
01:03:25.321 --> 01:03:27.453
- I don't wanna kill it!
- Get it off!

1154
01:03:30.674 --> 01:03:32.197
That's just a field mouse.

1155
01:03:32.241 --> 01:03:33.503
Oh.

1156
01:03:33.546 --> 01:03:36.332
Yeah, but that was gross.

1157
01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:38.769
Are you okay?

1158
01:03:40.336 --> 01:03:42.686
Besides the fact that we're
being chased by murderers

1159
01:03:42.729 --> 01:03:46.516
and a rodent just tried to
use my pants as its new home?

1160
01:03:46.559 --> 01:03:47.865
I'm fine.

1161
01:03:47.909 --> 01:03:49.649
So you're okay?

1162
01:03:49.693 --> 01:03:50.781
Eh.

1163
01:03:50.825 --> 01:03:53.305
I'll take that as a yes.

1164
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:56.656
All right, I'll keep
looking for stuff.

1165
01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:04.620
Whoa.

1166
01:04:13.586 --> 01:04:14.674
I can take that.

1167
01:04:14.718 --> 01:04:15.893
You bets-ta.

1168
01:04:36.305 --> 01:04:37.697
Let's go back to the campsite.

1169
01:04:37.741 --> 01:04:40.613
I promise I'll make it worth it.

1170
01:04:46.576 --> 01:04:47.533
No, we're gonna
rest here tonight

1171
01:04:47.577 --> 01:04:50.362
and then we're
gonna go back out.

1172
01:04:50.406 --> 01:04:51.644
It's gonna get
really cold tonight

1173
01:04:51.668 --> 01:04:52.538
and they're gonna
have to build a fire

1174
01:04:52.582 --> 01:04:54.584
if they wanna stay alive.

1175
01:04:57.282 --> 01:04:59.981
We find the fire,
we find the kids.

1176
01:05:07.945 --> 01:05:09.642
I'm so tired and starving.

1177
01:05:09.686 --> 01:05:11.601
Can we stop and eat
and get some rest?

1178
01:05:11.644 --> 01:05:13.298
Yeah.

1179
01:05:13.342 --> 01:05:14.342
Here.

1180
01:05:35.625 --> 01:05:36.756
The lid's sharp.

1181
01:05:48.768 --> 01:05:50.988
Do you think
anyone will find us?

1182
01:05:51.032 --> 01:05:52.337
Are you kidding me?

1183
01:05:52.381 --> 01:05:53.948
You know mom is worried
to death by now.

1184
01:05:53.991 --> 01:05:56.056
She probably has everybody
in the state looking for us.

1185
01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:58.648
Yeah, but, no one
knows we're here but us.

1186
01:05:58.691 --> 01:06:01.912
She thinks we're at
Grandma and Grandpa's.

1187
01:06:01.956 --> 01:06:03.653
We'll be fine.

1188
01:06:03.696 --> 01:06:05.698
I'm so tired.

1189
01:06:05.742 --> 01:06:07.352
Why don't you get some rest

1190
01:06:07.396 --> 01:06:11.052
while I go out and get
some firewood for tonight?

1191
01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:15.970
Dad would've
been proud of you.

1192
01:06:16.013 --> 01:06:17.013
Thanks.

1193
01:06:49.655 --> 01:06:50.655
Jaime?

1194
01:07:20.556 --> 01:07:21.731
Jaime!

1195
01:07:21.774 --> 01:07:23.124
Leave her alone!

1196
01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:41.707
Scottie?

1197
01:07:41.751 --> 01:07:42.751
Scottie.

1198
01:07:53.763 --> 01:07:54.807
Scottie.

1199
01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:58.681
If we were to
see a grizzly bear

1200
01:07:58.724 --> 01:08:00.117
and if one were
to try to attack,

1201
01:08:00.161 --> 01:08:02.598
then what you do is
you pretend to be dead,

1202
01:08:02.641 --> 01:08:07.646
'cause then they get disinterested
and they leave you alone.

1203
01:08:48.818 --> 01:08:50.820
Jaime, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

1204
01:08:50.863 --> 01:08:52.038
- Oh.
- Scottie!

1205
01:08:53.170 --> 01:08:54.780
I thought you were dead.

1206
01:08:54.824 --> 01:08:57.000
Eh, it's just a
mean old grizzly bear.

1207
01:08:57.043 --> 01:08:59.785
Nothing I couldn't handle.

1208
01:08:59.829 --> 01:09:00.960
Your arm.

1209
01:09:02.614 --> 01:09:03.920
Yeah. He got me.

1210
01:09:05.661 --> 01:09:07.967
He got me pretty good.

1211
01:09:08.011 --> 01:09:11.101
Here.

1212
01:09:11.145 --> 01:09:12.145
Lay down.

1213
01:09:13.147 --> 01:09:14.147
Yeah.

1214
01:09:16.715 --> 01:09:17.977
Yeah.

1215
01:09:18.021 --> 01:09:20.632
Maybe just for a minute.

1216
01:09:20.676 --> 01:09:22.808
I'm gonna close my eyes.

1217
01:09:22.852 --> 01:09:24.158
Scottie?

1218
01:09:24.201 --> 01:09:25.201
Scottie?

1219
01:09:35.212 --> 01:09:36.212
What the?

1220
01:09:38.215 --> 01:09:39.825
Did you do all this?

1221
01:09:39.869 --> 01:09:41.218
I cleaned you up.

1222
01:09:41.262 --> 01:09:43.177
You had blood all over you.

1223
01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:47.006
And let me tell you,
red is not your color.

1224
01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:50.053
Believe it or not, I was
also paying attention

1225
01:09:50.096 --> 01:09:52.186
when Dad was showing
you first aid.

1226
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:55.058
And I watch tons
of survival shows.

1227
01:09:55.101 --> 01:09:56.929
I know what you're thinking,

1228
01:09:56.973 --> 01:10:00.019
how can I be so
beautiful and smart, too?

1229
01:10:00.063 --> 01:10:01.934
I don't know. I just am.

1230
01:10:01.978 --> 01:10:03.980
It's crazy, right?

1231
01:10:04.023 --> 01:10:05.305
What's up with
the taking my shoes?

1232
01:10:05.329 --> 01:10:06.852
I'll explain later.

1233
01:10:06.896 --> 01:10:07.896
Look.

1234
01:10:08.941 --> 01:10:10.334
The deeper we go into the woods,

1235
01:10:10.378 --> 01:10:12.728
the less likely we make
it out of here alive.

1236
01:10:12.771 --> 01:10:15.165
Okay, so what do you suggest?

1237
01:10:16.297 --> 01:10:18.690
We have to make it here.

1238
01:10:19.778 --> 01:10:22.694
Okay, to make it there we
have to go by their camp site.

1239
01:10:22.738 --> 01:10:24.218
And when we get there
we have at least

1240
01:10:24.261 --> 01:10:25.697
10 miles to the road.

1241
01:10:25.741 --> 01:10:27.221
I know that.

1242
01:10:27.264 --> 01:10:28.831
So how are we gonna do that?

1243
01:10:28.874 --> 01:10:30.354
We'll backtrack.

1244
01:10:30.398 --> 01:10:32.071
We'll walk along the bank of
the stream until we pass them.

1245
01:10:32.095 --> 01:10:33.009
Okay.

1246
01:10:33.052 --> 01:10:35.229
Uh, let's suppose that works,

1247
01:10:35.272 --> 01:10:37.143
and we make it
back to their camp.

1248
01:10:37.187 --> 01:10:39.320
We still have at least
10 miles until the road.

1249
01:10:39.363 --> 01:10:41.191
Once we get to camp
it should be empty

1250
01:10:41.235 --> 01:10:43.933
except for the tents
and four wheelers.

1251
01:10:43.976 --> 01:10:45.761
How did you come
up with all this?

1252
01:10:45.804 --> 01:10:49.025
I may be a kid,
but I am not stupid.

1253
01:10:49.068 --> 01:10:50.068
Let's go.

1254
01:11:18.663 --> 01:11:19.969
Let's go, come on.

1255
01:11:30.936 --> 01:11:34.070
So, what happens when they find
where we camped last night?

1256
01:11:34.113 --> 01:11:35.898
You know they're
gonna track us here.

1257
01:11:35.941 --> 01:11:37.769
They always do.

1258
01:11:37.813 --> 01:11:42.078
Big brother, as always,
you underestimate me.

1259
01:11:48.476 --> 01:11:51.653
♪ And your arm bone

1260
01:11:58.007 --> 01:11:59.443
- Yo.
- What's up?

1261
01:11:59.487 --> 01:12:01.010
They played us.

1262
01:12:01.053 --> 01:12:02.228
What are you talking about?

1263
01:12:02.272 --> 01:12:03.142
We've been here already, man.

1264
01:12:03.186 --> 01:12:05.362
We're going in circles.

1265
01:12:05.406 --> 01:12:09.758
Wesley, seriously
man, we can just let them go.

1266
01:12:13.152 --> 01:12:14.304
Anybody here wanna back out,

1267
01:12:14.328 --> 01:12:16.852
let him or her say right now.

1268
01:12:16.895 --> 01:12:18.220
They deserve
what's comin' to 'em

1269
01:12:18.244 --> 01:12:20.986
for killin' my brother.

1270
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:24.076
See, he wasn't
just your brother.

1271
01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.165
We're all brothers
and sisters here.

1272
01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:28.080
That's what this means.

1273
01:12:30.256 --> 01:12:32.084
And if you're not a
part of this family...

1274
01:12:32.128 --> 01:12:33.172
Hey.

1275
01:12:33.216 --> 01:12:33.999
Then you're a traitor.

1276
01:12:34.043 --> 01:12:35.044
- Listen, Bull.
- Mm-mm.

1277
01:12:35.087 --> 01:12:36.175
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

1278
01:12:36.219 --> 01:12:38.439
Now we can take care
of that right now.

1279
01:12:38.482 --> 01:12:39.353
Mm-hm.

1280
01:12:39.396 --> 01:12:40.745
Bull, Bull?

1281
01:12:40.789 --> 01:12:41.789
Hey?

1282
01:12:42.312 --> 01:12:43.922
You guys are right.

1283
01:12:43.966 --> 01:12:45.335
Um, I'm sorry. I don't
know what I was thinkin'.

1284
01:12:45.359 --> 01:12:48.013
Just, I'm on board with
you guys, just relax, okay?

1285
01:12:48.057 --> 01:12:49.188
Relax.

1286
01:12:49.232 --> 01:12:51.016
We'll find 'em. I'm on board.

1287
01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:52.104
You're right.

1288
01:13:00.199 --> 01:13:04.029
They're goin' for
the four-wheelers.

1289
01:13:04.073 --> 01:13:05.944
How do you know that?

1290
01:13:07.424 --> 01:13:10.166
Because it's
their only chance.

1291
01:13:25.094 --> 01:13:29.315
We need to find some
keys. Go in Wesley's tent.

1292
01:13:39.282 --> 01:13:41.502
Thank you, Uncle Joey.

1293
01:13:41.545 --> 01:13:44.243
I got the keys, let's go.

1294
01:14:09.312 --> 01:14:10.095
Give me the keys.

1295
01:14:10.139 --> 01:14:11.140
I can't let you do it.

1296
01:14:11.183 --> 01:14:13.055
I can't let you kill those kids.

1297
01:14:13.098 --> 01:14:14.448
Give me the keys!

1298
01:14:14.491 --> 01:14:15.491
No!

1299
01:14:53.182 --> 01:14:55.097
Come on, go faster! Come on!

1300
01:15:07.588 --> 01:15:09.285
You're dead.

1301
01:15:10.982 --> 01:15:12.288
Jaime!

1302
01:15:12.331 --> 01:15:13.158
Just breathe.

1303
01:15:13.202 --> 01:15:15.204
Come on, breathe.

1304
01:15:15.247 --> 01:15:17.511
Breathe, just breathe. Come on.

1305
01:15:17.554 --> 01:15:19.600
Come on, stay with
me, breathe. Come on.

1306
01:15:22.298 --> 01:15:23.342
Come on.

1307
01:15:25.083 --> 01:15:25.867
Breathe.

1308
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:27.390
Breathe. Come on.

1309
01:15:47.628 --> 01:15:49.238
Bull, you good?

1310
01:15:49.281 --> 01:15:50.065
I'm good, man.

1311
01:15:50.108 --> 01:15:51.196
Go get them kids, man!

1312
01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.198
Let's go, let's go!

1313
01:15:57.942 --> 01:15:58.942
Ah!

1314
01:16:00.292 --> 01:16:01.555
We're outta gas.

1315
01:16:03.382 --> 01:16:05.384
Do you see them?

1316
01:16:05.428 --> 01:16:06.211
No.

1317
01:16:06.255 --> 01:16:07.561
I think we lost 'em.

1318
01:16:07.604 --> 01:16:10.215
Come on, we gotta keep goin'.

1319
01:16:11.303 --> 01:16:12.217
Come on, come on.

1320
01:16:12.261 --> 01:16:13.541
All right, we gotta go. Come on.

1321
01:16:30.627 --> 01:16:31.410
Anything?

1322
01:16:31.454 --> 01:16:33.108
No, nothing yet.

1323
01:16:40.332 --> 01:16:42.291
Come on, come on.

1324
01:16:42.334 --> 01:16:44.554
Come here, come here.

1325
01:16:49.515 --> 01:16:52.214
We gotta go, right here.

1326
01:16:52.257 --> 01:16:53.476
Okay, let's go.

1327
01:16:53.519 --> 01:16:54.346
Stop.

1328
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:56.261
I need to rest.

1329
01:16:56.305 --> 01:16:58.089
Hey, hey, hey, it's all right.

1330
01:16:58.133 --> 01:17:00.526
Hey, hey, hey.

1331
01:17:00.570 --> 01:17:01.658
Hey, look at me.

1332
01:17:01.702 --> 01:17:02.702
Look at me.

1333
01:17:04.226 --> 01:17:05.009
It's gonna be all right.

1334
01:17:05.053 --> 01:17:06.358
All right?

1335
01:17:12.321 --> 01:17:14.453
All right, I'm gonna try
to take it out, all right?

1336
01:17:14.497 --> 01:17:17.282
Please make the pain go away.

1337
01:17:17.326 --> 01:17:19.284
All right, on three.

1338
01:17:19.328 --> 01:17:20.721
One...

1339
01:17:20.764 --> 01:17:21.678
Two...

1340
01:17:21.722 --> 01:17:22.722
Three.

1341
01:17:30.731 --> 01:17:32.341
I can't get it out.

1342
01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:41.219
Come on, we gotta keep going.

1343
01:17:41.263 --> 01:17:42.307
Okay, let's go.

1344
01:17:42.351 --> 01:17:44.092
Come on.

1345
01:17:44.135 --> 01:17:47.312
Let's go, come on, come on.

1346
01:18:05.330 --> 01:18:06.636
Which way?

1347
01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:09.421
I think they either
went over or around.

1348
01:18:09.465 --> 01:18:10.703
I'm gonna go
up, you go around.

1349
01:18:10.727 --> 01:18:11.641
Move it!

1350
01:18:11.685 --> 01:18:14.383
Let's go!

1351
01:18:36.274 --> 01:18:37.406
I got you now.

1352
01:18:51.376 --> 01:18:53.291
Nowhere to go but up.

1353
01:19:10.439 --> 01:19:12.746
Bring your arm
here up, come on.

1354
01:19:18.795 --> 01:19:19.753
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1355
01:19:19.796 --> 01:19:21.406
- I'm okay.
- Come on.

1356
01:19:26.107 --> 01:19:27.761
We can camp here for the night.

1357
01:19:27.804 --> 01:19:30.459
That'll give you enough time
to regain strength, all right?

1358
01:19:30.502 --> 01:19:32.504
No, you have to go without me.

1359
01:19:32.548 --> 01:19:33.767
No.

1360
01:19:33.810 --> 01:19:37.553
Mm-mm, I'm not leaving
you. It's not an option.

1361
01:19:39.642 --> 01:19:40.642
All right.

1362
01:19:41.426 --> 01:19:43.777
I'm gonna go get some firewood.

1363
01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:44.821
Hey.

1364
01:19:44.865 --> 01:19:46.518
You're all right.

1365
01:19:46.562 --> 01:19:47.606
Okay?

1366
01:20:14.329 --> 01:20:16.157
I got you, I got you!

1367
01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:17.636
I got you.

1368
01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:18.812
I got you!

1369
01:20:18.855 --> 01:20:20.465
Help, Scottie, help.

1370
01:20:20.509 --> 01:20:22.816
Yeah, Scottie, help.

1371
01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.775
Help, Scottie.

1372
01:20:27.908 --> 01:20:29.474
Come out!

1373
01:20:31.389 --> 01:20:34.523
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

1374
01:20:35.393 --> 01:20:37.656
I know you can hear me.

1375
01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:39.658
Are you listening?

1376
01:20:39.702 --> 01:20:42.966
This sweet little, young,
little innocent girl.

1377
01:20:43.010 --> 01:20:44.838
Yeah, Scottie.

1378
01:20:44.881 --> 01:20:46.927
She has her whole
life ahead of her.

1379
01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:48.929
What are you gonna do?

1380
01:20:48.972 --> 01:20:51.540
Don't do it, Scottie. Run.

1381
01:20:51.583 --> 01:20:53.455
I'll tell you what.

1382
01:20:53.498 --> 01:20:56.414
I'll tell you what, Scottie.

1383
01:20:59.896 --> 01:21:02.507
I'll spare her life for yours.

1384
01:21:05.641 --> 01:21:09.514
If you're not out on here
on the count of three,

1385
01:21:09.558 --> 01:21:10.970
well let's just say
sweet little Jaime

1386
01:21:10.994 --> 01:21:13.257
is gonna be joining Joey!

1387
01:21:15.651 --> 01:21:16.870
It's your choice!

1388
01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:19.480
One...

1389
01:21:21.570 --> 01:21:22.571
Two...

1390
01:21:22.614 --> 01:21:23.615
Don't do it, Scottie!

1391
01:21:23.659 --> 01:21:24.921
Run!

1392
01:21:24.965 --> 01:21:25.791
Three!

1393
01:21:25.835 --> 01:21:26.835
Wait!

1394
01:21:28.577 --> 01:21:29.883
No one else has to die.

1395
01:21:29.926 --> 01:21:32.711
Oh, you're wrong about that.

1396
01:21:33.799 --> 01:21:34.888
Drop the gun.

1397
01:21:36.367 --> 01:21:37.388
I'll finish her right here.

1398
01:21:37.412 --> 01:21:38.282
You know I'll do it.

1399
01:21:38.326 --> 01:21:40.589
I got nothin' to lose, man.

1400
01:21:44.419 --> 01:21:45.681
Don't do it, Scottie.

1401
01:21:45.724 --> 01:21:46.725
Run.

1402
01:21:54.037 --> 01:21:54.864
Time is up.

1403
01:21:54.908 --> 01:21:56.648
Okay, all right.

1404
01:21:56.692 --> 01:21:57.606
What do you want me to do?

1405
01:21:57.649 --> 01:21:59.303
Toss me the gun.

1406
01:22:02.002 --> 01:22:04.569
Go over there to your brother.

1407
01:22:05.744 --> 01:22:07.616
I'm sorry it's
gotta end like this.

1408
01:22:07.659 --> 01:22:10.575
Just at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

1409
01:22:38.777 --> 01:22:41.911
Joey never even touched me.

1410
01:22:41.955 --> 01:22:43.913
I was with Edward.

1411
01:22:43.957 --> 01:22:46.307
I love him, and now
you're never gonna

1412
01:22:46.350 --> 01:22:48.309
hurt anyone ever again.

1413
01:22:53.705 --> 01:22:54.705
It's okay.

1414
01:23:11.767 --> 01:23:12.767
Hey!

1415
01:23:16.685 --> 01:23:17.685
Hey!

1416
01:23:19.818 --> 01:23:21.646
Air base to one,
this is Chief Baumgardner.

1417
01:23:21.690 --> 01:23:22.996
I think we found them.

1418
01:23:23.039 --> 01:23:24.998
We're preparing to land.

1419
01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.004
Oh my god.

1420
01:23:31.047 --> 01:23:32.092
May have some injuries.

1421
01:23:32.135 --> 01:23:34.659
Have a couple of
ambulances on stand by.

1422
01:23:34.703 --> 01:23:35.703
Roger, out.

1423
01:23:45.061 --> 01:23:46.410
On the ground!

1424
01:23:47.977 --> 01:23:49.109
On the ground!

1425
01:23:50.849 --> 01:23:51.850
Do not move.

1426
01:24:21.793 --> 01:24:22.881
Mom!

1427
01:24:25.841 --> 01:24:26.929
Are you okay?

1428
01:24:26.972 --> 01:24:28.887
- I'm all right.
- You hurt?

1429
01:24:28.931 --> 01:24:30.063
What happened to your arm?

1430
01:24:30.106 --> 01:24:30.889
Don't worry.

1431
01:24:30.933 --> 01:24:32.543
Jaime took care of me.

1432
01:24:32.587 --> 01:24:35.807
Besides, you wouldn't
believe me if I told you.

1433
01:24:35.851 --> 01:24:36.852
Oh, Jaime.

1434
01:24:39.246 --> 01:24:41.770
All right, very careful now.

1435
01:24:41.813 --> 01:24:43.641
Step down, that's it, good girl.

1436
01:24:43.685 --> 01:24:44.773
Oh.

1437
01:24:45.774 --> 01:24:46.731
Jaime.

1438
01:24:46.775 --> 01:24:47.776
Oh, baby.

1439
01:24:49.778 --> 01:24:50.822
Mom.

1440
01:24:50.866 --> 01:24:52.694
Are you okay?

1441
01:24:52.737 --> 01:24:53.737
Oh, god.

1442
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:56.611
Is she gonna be okay?

1443
01:24:57.525 --> 01:24:58.961
- Oh.
- She's a tough one.

1444
01:24:59.004 --> 01:25:00.004
Baby.

1445
01:25:59.021 --> 01:25:59.804
Hey.

1446
01:25:59.848 --> 01:26:00.979
Hey Chief.

1447
01:26:01.023 --> 01:26:01.937
Hey Scottie,
how are you doing?

1448
01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:03.156
I'm good.

1449
01:26:03.199 --> 01:26:04.220
Everything's finally
getting back to normal.

1450
01:26:04.244 --> 01:26:05.201
Oh that's good news.

1451
01:26:05.245 --> 01:26:06.898
Good, good.

1452
01:26:06.942 --> 01:26:08.180
Well what do we
owe the pleasure?

1453
01:26:08.204 --> 01:26:10.163
Oh, I just happened
to be in your fine city

1454
01:26:10.206 --> 01:26:11.903
and I thought I'd
stop by, check in,

1455
01:26:11.947 --> 01:26:14.819
see how things are goin'.

1456
01:26:14.863 --> 01:26:15.863
How's Jaime?

1457
01:26:16.952 --> 01:26:19.041
Well she's getting
on my last nerve,

1458
01:26:19.084 --> 01:26:20.825
but I wouldn't have
it any other way?

1459
01:26:20.869 --> 01:26:22.175
Good.

1460
01:26:22.218 --> 01:26:23.263
Well, yeah...

1461
01:26:24.916 --> 01:26:26.309
I just wanted to
say spending time

1462
01:26:26.353 --> 01:26:28.113
with you and your sister
over the last couple of weeks

1463
01:26:28.137 --> 01:26:30.095
has been really good for me.

1464
01:26:30.139 --> 01:26:31.139
I uh...

1465
01:26:32.881 --> 01:26:37.059
In you kids I see my
grandkids and I lost them

1466
01:26:37.102 --> 01:26:38.974
a couple of years ago.

1467
01:26:39.017 --> 01:26:42.717
They're in heaven now,
and uh, I miss 'em.

1468
01:26:45.023 --> 01:26:46.044
So I was thinking
that, you know,

1469
01:26:46.068 --> 01:26:47.939
if it's all right
with all of you,

1470
01:26:47.983 --> 01:26:50.638
maybe I could every now
and then stop by, check in,

1471
01:26:50.681 --> 01:26:51.943
see how you're doin'?

1472
01:26:51.987 --> 01:26:52.857
Scottie?

1473
01:26:52.901 --> 01:26:53.815
Yeah.

1474
01:26:53.858 --> 01:26:54.922
That'd be cool. I'd like that.

1475
01:26:54.946 --> 01:26:55.947
Me, too.

1476
01:26:55.991 --> 01:26:56.948
Me three.

1477
01:26:56.992 --> 01:26:59.647
Besides, you saved my kids.

1478
01:26:59.690 --> 01:27:01.910
Oh, I didn't save 'em.

1479
01:27:01.953 --> 01:27:03.781
They saved themselves.

1480
01:27:04.913 --> 01:27:07.045
Well, you brought
them home to me,

1481
01:27:07.089 --> 01:27:09.874
and for that, I'm
forever grateful.

1482
01:27:09.918 --> 01:27:11.311
You are always welcome.

1483
01:27:11.354 --> 01:27:12.660
Oh, thank you.

1484
01:27:12.703 --> 01:27:14.009
Thank you.

1485
01:27:14.052 --> 01:27:15.837
Hey, let me get in on that.

1486
01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:16.881
Oh absolutely.

1487
01:27:16.925 --> 01:27:17.882
Oh, boy.

1488
01:27:17.926 --> 01:27:19.754
Watch that arm.

1489
01:27:19.797 --> 01:27:21.625
You guys are the best.

1490
01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.977
Where are you off to?

1491
01:27:26.021 --> 01:27:27.631
Oh don't worry about me.

1492
01:27:27.675 --> 01:27:29.024
I'll be right back.

1493
01:27:29.067 --> 01:27:31.200
I have some unfinished
business to attend to.

1494
01:27:31.244 --> 01:27:32.897
- Oh.
- Chief.

1495
01:27:32.941 --> 01:27:35.073
I got your back.

1496
01:27:35.117 --> 01:27:36.727
Yeah, I got yours, too.

1497
01:27:39.948 --> 01:27:40.905
Would you like to come in?

1498
01:27:40.949 --> 01:27:42.646
Oh...

1499
01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:43.386
That'd be nice.

1500
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:44.692
Come on in.

1501
01:27:45.954 --> 01:27:47.172
What's your problem Amy?

1502
01:27:47.216 --> 01:27:48.913
I don't have a
problem. You're mine.

1503
01:27:48.957 --> 01:27:50.263
Well come on, let's just go.

1504
01:27:50.306 --> 01:27:52.047
I don't wanna
go on a ride with you.

1505
01:27:52.090 --> 01:27:53.701
Whoa.

1506
01:27:53.744 --> 01:27:54.745
Just get out of my way.

1507
01:27:54.789 --> 01:27:55.703
- Calm down.
- Stop.

1508
01:27:55.746 --> 01:27:58.053
My parents are waiting for me.

1509
01:28:01.361 --> 01:28:03.363
Mickey, can you move so
I can get into my house?

1510
01:28:03.406 --> 01:28:05.234
Come on Amy, let's
take a ride on your bike.

1511
01:28:05.278 --> 01:28:07.430
I don't wanna take a ride
on my bike, I wanna go home.

1512
01:28:07.454 --> 01:28:08.368
Just get out of my way.

1513
01:28:08.411 --> 01:28:09.804
What is your problem?

1514
01:28:09.847 --> 01:28:10.631
- I don't want to-
- Hey, is there

1515
01:28:10.674 --> 01:28:12.676
a problem here?

1516
01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:14.896
The only problem is you.

1517
01:28:16.245 --> 01:28:18.378
Beat if before I beat you.

1518
01:28:24.297 --> 01:28:25.796
Come on Amy, let's
just go to the park.

1519
01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:26.647
I don't want to
go to the park.

1520
01:28:26.690 --> 01:28:28.039
I just wanna go inside.

1521
01:28:28.083 --> 01:28:29.693
I don't want you
to go in with me.

1522
01:28:29.737 --> 01:28:30.825
Can you just let me go by?

1523
01:28:30.868 --> 01:28:32.348
- Amy.
- Okay, just leave her alone.

1524
01:28:32.392 --> 01:28:33.871
I warned ya.

1525
01:28:34.829 --> 01:28:35.656
Scottie!

1526
01:28:35.699 --> 01:28:36.352
Hey.

1527
01:28:36.396 --> 01:28:37.962
Hey.

1528
01:28:38.006 --> 01:28:38.789
Okay.

1529
01:28:38.833 --> 01:28:40.269
Here.

1530
01:28:40.313 --> 01:28:42.227
Wait, wait.

1531
01:28:47.842 --> 01:28:49.322
You've had this
the whole time?

1532
01:28:49.365 --> 01:28:50.365
Yeah.

1533
01:28:52.803 --> 01:28:55.850
It may sound silly,
but it kept me alive.

1534
01:28:56.807 --> 01:28:59.941
What are you doing
with that loser anyway?

1535
01:28:59.984 --> 01:29:02.900
The only loser here is you.

1536
01:29:05.468 --> 01:29:06.687
Hey.

1537
01:29:20.135 --> 01:29:21.136
Hey, wait.

1538
01:29:24.444 --> 01:29:27.142
- That was awesome.
- So, can I join you?

1539
01:29:27.185 --> 01:29:28.709
