Gee.

1038
01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:40.798
That's pretty corny though, huh?

1039
01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:44.134
Oh, no. Not at all.

1040
01:04:44.297 --> 01:04:46.174
Any woman would like it.

1041
01:04:46.341 --> 01:04:48.844
(CHUCKLES) I-I mean...

1042
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:50.683
even little Marie.

1043
01:04:51.846 --> 01:04:53.348
O'MALLEY: Yeah.

1044
01:04:53.515 --> 01:04:55.768
All those little kittens, Duchess.

1045
01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:58.027
I love 'em.

1046
01:04:58.186 --> 01:05:00.029
DUCHESS:
And they are very fond of you.

1047
01:05:00.188 --> 01:05:01.235
- Yeah.
- Shh.

1048
01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:05.699
O'MALLEY: You know, they need...
Well, you know, a sort...

1049
01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:09.831
Well, a sort of a...
Well, a father around.

1050
01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:13.038
Oh, Thomas, Thomas,
that would be wonderful.

1051
01:05:16.037 --> 01:05:19.007
Darling, if only I could.

1052
01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:20.838
O'MALLEY: But why can't you?

1053
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.673
Because of Madame.

1054
01:05:22.836 --> 01:05:25.385
I could never leave her.

1055
01:05:25.547 --> 01:05:28.551
But... But Madame's...

1056
01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:31.469
Well, she's just another human.

1057
01:05:31.636 --> 01:05:34.139
You're just her house pets.

1058
01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:35.727
Oh, no, no.

1059
01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:38.769
We mean far more to her than that.

1060
01:05:40.562 --> 01:05:42.906
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear.

1061
01:05:44.065 --> 01:05:46.409
We just have to go home tomorrow.

1062
01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:48.445
O'MALLEY: Yeah.

1063
01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:51.831
Well, I guess you know best.

1064
01:05:53.074 --> 01:05:54.826
But I'm gonna miss you, baby.

1065
01:05:54.993 --> 01:05:57.837
(CHUCKLES) And those kids...

1066
01:05:57.996 --> 01:06:01.500
- (SIGHING)
- Gee, I'm gonna miss them too.

1067
01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:04.010
Well, we almost had a father.

1068
01:06:04.169 --> 01:06:06.388
Yeah. (YAWNING)

1069
01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:08.594
Let's go back to bed.

1070
01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:14.558
Good night, Duchess.

1071
01:06:15.597 --> 01:06:17.395
Good night, Thomas.

1072
01:06:41.122 --> 01:06:42.465
Hey.

1073
01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:46.128
Meow!

1074
01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:48.262
What a classy neighbourhood.

1075
01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:51.641
Dig these fancy wigwams.

1076
01:06:51.799 --> 01:06:53.051
Wigwams?

1077
01:06:53.218 --> 01:06:55.312
Are you sure we're
on the right street?

1078
01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:58.314
Yes. Yes, let's hurry.
We're almost home.

1079
01:06:58.473 --> 01:07:02.774
Duchess! Kittens!
Hallelujah, they're back!

1080
01:07:07.982 --> 01:07:10.030
Oh, no. Edgar!

1081
01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:11.991
I've got to do something, quick.

1082
01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:13.996
Oh, ha.

1083
01:07:14.155 --> 01:07:17.329
Edgar, old chap, get used to
the finer things in life.

1084
01:07:17.492 --> 01:07:20.621
Someday they're all
going to be yours,

1085
01:07:20.787 --> 01:07:22.664
you sly old fox.

1086
01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:25.500
Oh!

1087
01:07:26.668 --> 01:07:27.965
Oh, he got me.

1088
01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:29.754
Hooray! We're home.

1089
01:07:29.921 --> 01:07:31.923
Wait for me, wait for me!

1090
01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:35.310
- MARIE: Me first, me first!
- (GRUNTING)

1091
01:07:36.803 --> 01:07:39.056
- It's locked.
- Come on.

1092
01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:41.145
Let's all start meowing.

1094
01:07:45.353 --> 01:07:47.355
- It can't be them.
- The kittens.

1095
01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:51.359
Uh, why?

1096
01:07:54.946 --> 01:07:57.620
Don't come in!

1097
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.702
Go away!

1098
01:08:00.868 --> 01:08:04.372
- Away!
- Look, there's Roquefort.

1099
01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:06.291
Hi, Roquefort!

1100
01:08:06.457 --> 01:08:08.084
BERLIOZ: He's glad to see us.

1101
01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:12.176
(SIGHING) I don't know what to say.

1102
01:08:13.047 --> 01:08:14.924
I only wish that I...

1103
01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:20.188
Maybe just a short, sweet
goodbye would be easiest.

1104
01:08:20.346 --> 01:08:24.647
I'll never forget you,
Thomas O'Malley.

1105
01:08:26.686 --> 01:08:28.233
Bye.

1106
01:08:28.396 --> 01:08:29.898
So long, baby.

1107
01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:33.739
Don't come in. Look out for Edgar!

1108
01:08:41.576 --> 01:08:44.420
Duchess, wherever have you been?

1109
01:08:44.579 --> 01:08:46.331
Look out for the...

1110
01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:49.546
- (MEOWING)
- ...sack.

1111
01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:54.556
Well... guess they won't
need me any more.

1112
01:08:55.715 --> 01:08:57.763
You came back?

1113
01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:00.887
It just isn't fair.

1114
01:09:01.054 --> 01:09:03.807
MADAME:
Edgar? Edgar, come quickly.

1115
01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:06.772
Coming, Madame, coming.

1116
01:09:06.934 --> 01:09:10.108
I'll take care of you later.

1117
01:09:10.271 --> 01:09:12.114
Oh, Edgar, they're back.

1118
01:09:12.273 --> 01:09:15.777
I heard them. Hurry,
hurry, let them in.

1119
01:09:16.611 --> 01:09:19.911
Duchess? Kittens?

1120
01:09:20.782 --> 01:09:22.625
Come here, my darlings.

1121
01:09:22.784 --> 01:09:24.127
Where are you?

1122
01:09:24.285 --> 01:09:27.459
- Come on.
- Uh, allow me, Madame.

1123
01:09:28.706 --> 01:09:33.462
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

1124
01:09:33.628 --> 01:09:35.471
His name is O... what?

1125
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:37.758
DUCHESS:
His name is O'Malley. O'Malley.

1126
01:09:37.924 --> 01:09:40.052
MARIE:
Abraham de Lacy, Giuseppe Casey...

1127
01:09:40.218 --> 01:09:43.017
DUCHESS: Oh, never mind.
Just run, move, go get him!

1128
01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:44.977
Yes, yes, I'm on my way.

1129
01:09:45.139 --> 01:09:47.813
TOULOUSE: I told you it was Edgar.

1130
01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:50.273
BERLIOZ: Aw, shut up, Toulouse.

1131
01:09:50.436 --> 01:09:52.313
Oh, it's no use, Edgar.

1132
01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:57.577
I'm afraid it was just the
imagination of an old lady.

1133
01:09:57.735 --> 01:10:01.160
But I was so sure
that I heard them.

1134
01:10:01.322 --> 01:10:03.620
I'm so sorry, Madame.

1135

Mr. O'Malley!

1136
01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:20.637
Hey, stop!

1137
01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.974
(PANTING)
Duchess. Kittens. In trouble.

1138
01:10:24.137 --> 01:10:25.354
Butler did it.

1139
01:10:25.513 --> 01:10:27.265
Duchess and kittens in trouble?

1140
01:10:27.432 --> 01:10:30.606
Look, you go get Scat Cat
and his gang of alley cats.

1141
01:10:30.768 --> 01:10:32.691
Alley cats?

1142
01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:34.322
But I'm a mouse.

1143
01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.357
Look, I'm gonna need help.

1144
01:10:36.524 --> 01:10:38.367
- You mean, you want me...?
- Move!

1145
01:10:38.526 --> 01:10:41.871
Just tell 'em O'Malley sent you,
and you won't have a bit of trouble.

1146
01:10:48.661 --> 01:10:50.254
No trouble, he said.

1147
01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:53.713
Well, that's easy for...
for what's-his-name to say.

1148
01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:57.379
He's got nine lives.
I've only got one.

1149
01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:05.057
What's a little swinger like you
doing on our side of town?

1150
01:11:05.219 --> 01:11:09.565
Oh, please, I was sent
here for help by a cat.

1151
01:11:09.724 --> 01:11:12.227
This is outrageous. It's crazy.

1152
01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:15.067
(LAUGHTER)

1153
01:11:18.232 --> 01:11:21.907
But honest! He told me
just to mention his name.

1154
01:11:22.069 --> 01:11:25.414
So start mentioning name, rodent.

1155
01:11:25.573 --> 01:11:27.246
Oh, now, wait a minute, fellas.

1156
01:11:27.408 --> 01:11:29.661
(STUTTERING) Don't rush me.

1157
01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:31.249
His name is O'Toole.

1158
01:11:31.412 --> 01:11:34.086
I don't dig him. Strike one.

1159
01:11:34.248 --> 01:11:37.047
Oh, oh... O'Brien.

1160
01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:38.837

1163
01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:45.264
Keep talkin', mousey.

01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:47.724

01:11:49.764 --> 01:11:50.936
Huh?

1167
01:11:51.098 --> 01:11:53.601
Mousey, you just struck out.

1168
01:11:53.768 --> 01:11:56.772
Any last words?

1169
01:11:56.938 --> 01:11:59.282
Why did I listen to
that O'Malley cat?

1170
01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.784
- O'Malley?
- O'Malley?

- Hold it, cats.

ruffle you, squeaky.

You know, Georges, if Edgar had
only known about the will,

1213
01:16:01.348 --> 01:16:04.773
I'm sure he never would have left.

1214
01:16:04.935 --> 01:16:08.109
Duchess, it's wonderful
to have you all back.

1215
01:16:08.272 --> 01:16:11.526
And I think this young
man is very handsome.

be sure to provide

01:16:42.139 --> 01:16:43.356
