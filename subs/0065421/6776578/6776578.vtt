00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.720
...right...

536
00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.480
...here.

537
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.840
Oh, boy, we're gonna fly after all.

538
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.200
Another flight into the fantasy,
Monsieur O'Malley?

539
00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.520
No, no, no, baby.

540
00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:28.960
You just hide over there,

541
00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:32.160
and you leave the rest
to J. Thomas O'Malley.

542
00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.200
Quick, Mom, get in here.

543
00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:37.080
- But, children...
- [Marie] Hurry up, Mama, hurry.

544
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.280
[engine approaching]

545
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.520
One magic carpet, coming up.

546
00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.960
That's a magic carpet?

547
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.200
- [loud meowing]
- Sacré bleu!

548
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.640
[meowing]

549
00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:04.040
Sapristi! Stupid cat. Brainless lunatic.

550
00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:11.760
All right, step lively.
All aboard for Paris.

551
00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:15.520
Why, Mr. O'Malley, you could
have lost your life.

552
00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.560
So I got a few to spare.
Nothin'.

553
00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.760
- How can we ever thank you?
- My pleasure entirely.

554
00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:27.440
Aloha. Auf weidersehen.

555
00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.760
Bonsoir. Sayonara.

556
00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.400
And all those goodbye things, baby.

557
00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.080
Sayonara, mister...

558
00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.600
Mama!

559
00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.760
Marie! Marie!

560
00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.800
Oh, Marie, are you all right?

561
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.160
- Yes, Mama.
- Haven't we met before?

562
00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.600
And I'm so very glad we did.

563
00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.360
Thank you, Mr. O'Malley,
for saving my life.

564
00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:59.880
No trouble at all, little princess.

565
00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.680
And when we get to Paris, I'll
show you the time of your life.

566
00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.840
Oh, I'm so sorry, but...

567
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.840
...we just couldn't.

568
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.160
You see, my mistress
will be so worried about us.

569
00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:17.320
Well, humans don't really worry
too much about their pets.

570
00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.840
Oh, no. You just don't understand.

571
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.280
She loves us very much.

572
00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:29.840
Poor Madame,
in that big mansion, all alone.

573
00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.360
In all our days, in tender ways,

574
00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.800
her love for us was shown.

575
00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:45.040
And so you see,
we can't leave her alone.

576
00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:54.080
She'd always say that we're
the greatest treasure she could own.

577
00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:01.520
Because with us she never felt alone.

578
00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.320
Oh, Roquefort, I've been
so worried about you.

579
00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.720
Did you have any luck at all?

580
00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.000
Not a sign of them, Frou-Frou.

581
00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.520
And I've searched all night.

582
00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:18.080
I know. And poor Madame didn't
sleep a wink, either.

583
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.240
Oh, it's a sad day for all of us.

584
00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.240
[Edgar humming]

585
00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.000
Morning, Frou-Frou, my pretty steed.

586
00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.840
Can you keep a secret, hmm?

587
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.640
Of course you can.

588
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.040
[chuckling]

589
00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.240
I have some news straight
from the horse's mouth,

590
00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.720
if you'll pardon the expression,
of course.

591
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.560
Look, Frou-Frou.
I've made the headlines.

592
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:52.400
"Mysterious Catnapper
Abducts Family of Cats."

593
00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.880
[chuckling] Aren't you proud of me?

594
00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.520
So he's the catnapper.

595
00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.320
The police said it was
a professional, masterful job.

596
00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.920
The work of a genius.

597
00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.520
Not bad, eh, Frou-Frou old girl?

598
00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.520
[whinnying]

599
00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.600
[laughing]

600
00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.200
Oh, they won't find a clue
to implicate me.

601
00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.720
Not one single clue.

602
00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.720
Why, I'll eat my hat if they...

603
00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.120
My hat!

604
00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.040
My umbrella!

605
00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.800
Oh, oh, gracious.

606
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.560
I've got to get those things
back tonight.

607
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.160
[sputtering] But... oh, you...

608
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.720
Why, that...

609
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:34.560
...sneaky, crooked, no-good butler!

610
00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:47.320
- Anyone for breakfast?
- What breakfast?

611
00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:50.640
- Where is it?
- Right under that magic carpet.

612
00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.160
But now we have to cook up
a little spell.

613
00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.560
You know. Ready?

614
00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.680
All right.
First, to make the magic begin,

615
00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.640
you wiggle your nose.

616
00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.760
And tickle your chin.

617
00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.880
Now you close your eyes.

618
00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:11.440
And cross your heart.

619
00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.480
Then presto, breakfast à la carte.

620
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.600
Hooray!

621
00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.440
- We did it.
- [Toulouse] Look, Mama, look!

622
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.520
Why, Mr. O'Malley, you are amazing.

623
00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.320
True.

624
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.320
True.

625
00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.480
Sapristi!

626
00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.720
[brakes screeching]

627
00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.160
- [loud meowing]
- Sacré bleu!

628
00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.200
- [meowing]
- Thieves! Robbers!

629
00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.880
Mangy tramps!

630
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.400
Take that and that!

631
00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:53.400
Oh. Oh, what a horrible, horrible human.

632
00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:57.120
Well, some humans are like that,
Duchess. I've learned to live with it.

633
00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.320
I'll show him. [meowing and hissing]

634
00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.640
[O'Malley] Hey, cool it,
you little tiger.

635
00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:06.320
- That guy's dynamite.
- But he called us tramps.

636
00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:09.600
Oh, I'll be so glad
when we get back home.

637
00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.960
That's a long way off,
so we better get moving.

638
00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.600
Gee whiz.

639
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.600
Look at that bridge.

640
00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.160
Come on, let's play train.

641
00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.280
[Duchess] Now, be careful, children.

642
00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.840
Marie's the caboose. All aboard!

643
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.240
Choo choo choo, choo choo choo.

644
00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.720
[imitates train whistle]

645
00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.280
Choo choo choo choo...

646
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.960
[imitates train whistle]

647
00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.600
Clickedy, clickedy, clickedy, clickedy.

648
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.320
- [imitates train whistle]
- [real train whistle]

649
00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.200
- Oh, no.
- [O'Malley] Don't panic.

650
00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.960
Down underneath here.

651
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.880
- Mama!
- Marie!

652
00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.720
Oh, Marie!

653
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.960
[O'Malley] Keep your head up,
Marie! Here I come!

654
00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.720
Thomas! Thomas, up here.

655
00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:42.880
Gee, Marie, why did you have to
fall off the bridge?

656
00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.800
Thomas! Oh, Thomas! Take care!

657
00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.800
I'm all right, honey, don't worry.

658
00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.600
I'll see you downstream.

659
00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.200
What beautiful countryside, Abigail.

660
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:10.920
- So much like our own dear England.
- Indeed, yes.

661
00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:15.160
Amelia, if I walk much farther
I'll get flat feet.

662
00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:18.800
Abigail, we were born with flat feet.

663
00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.880
[both giggling]

664
00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.720
I say. Look over there.

665
00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:28.400
[Amelia] Oh. Oh, how unusual.

666
00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:31.560
[Abigail] Fancy that.
A cat learning how to swim.

667
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.720
He's going about it all the wrong way.

668
00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.440
Quite. We must correct him.

669
00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.400
Sir. Sir?

670
00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.240
You are most fortunate
we happened along.

671
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.400
Yes. We're here to help you.

672
00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:48.280
No, no. Back off, girls. I'm doing fine.

673
00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:52.240
First, you must gain self-confidence
by striking out on your own.

674
00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.200
Go away. I'm trying to get to shore.

675
00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:59.160
You will never learn to swim properly
with that willow branch in your mouth.

676
00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:03.760
Indeed, not. Snip, snip. Here we go.

677
00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.560
Don't do that!

678
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.560
You're doing splendidly.

679
00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:13.200
And don't worry about form.
It will come later.

680
00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.880
Oh, he takes to water
like a fish, doesn't he?

681
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:20.200
- A very enthusiastic pupil!
- [both screeching]

682
00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:26.240
No, no. This is no time
for fun and games.

683
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.120
[giggling]

684
00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.880
Gracious, Amelia.

685
00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:36.560
- You don't suppose...
- Oh, yes. Yes, I do.

686
00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.040
Bottoms up.

687
00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.640
[both] Deeper!

688
00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.120
Look, Ma, there he is.

689
00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.960
You really did quite well
for a beginner.

690
00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:58.400
Oh, Thomas. Thank goodness you're safe.

691
00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.920
- Keep practicing.
- And toodley-pip.

692
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.640
Can I help you, Mr. O'Malley, huh?

693
00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:08.480
[gasping] Help? I've had
all the help I can take.

694
00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:13.000
Oh, mademoiselles, thank you so
much for helping Mr. O'Malley.

695
00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:16.480
Of course, my dear.
But first, introductions.

696
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.840
Yes, we British like to keep
things proper.

697
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.840
[geese giggle]

698
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
Now, I am Amelia Gabble
and this is my sister...

699
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.480
- Miss Abigail Gabble.
- We're twin sisters.

700
00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:30.480
- You might say we're related.
- [giggling]

701
00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.160
How nice. I never would have guessed.

702
00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:34.560
[all giggling]

703
00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.520
Look, they got rubber feet.

704
00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:38.440
Yeah.

705
00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.320
- We're on holiday.
- For a walking tour of France.

706
00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:46.400
- [Abigail] Swimming some of the way.
- [Amelia] On water, of course.

707
00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:51.000
Thomas, this is Amelia
and Abigail Gabble.

708
00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:54.720
Yeah, honey, get those two
web-footed lifeguards out of here.

709
00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.040
Now, now, Thomas.

710
00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.880
OK, OK, baby.

711
00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.800
- Hiya, chicks.
- [giggling]

712
00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.440
How awful.

713
00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:06.200
[giggling continues]

714
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
We're not chickens. We're geese.

715
00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:14.040
Nooo. I thought you were swans.

716
00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.200
Oh! Oh, flatterer.

717
00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.880
Your husband is very charming
and very handsome.

718
00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.480
Well...

719
00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.720
Uh, you see, I'm not exactly
her husband.

720
00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:29.720
Exactly? You either are or you're not.

721
00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.040
All right. I'm not.

722
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.240
[both] Oh?

723
00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.760
Hm.

724
00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.520
- It's scandalous.
- He's nothing but a cad.

725
00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:40.840
Absolutely. Possibly a reprobate.

726
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.520
- A roué.
- His eyes are too close together.

727
00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:46.760
- [Amelia] Shifty, too.
- [Abigail] Look at his crooked smile.

728
00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.440
His chin is very weak, too.

729
00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:53.880
Obviously, a philanderer who trifles
with unsuspecting women's hearts.

730
00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.520
How romantic.

731
00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.640
Please, please, let me explain.

732
00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:03.240
Thomas is a dear friend of ours.

733
00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:06.120
- He's just helping us to get to...
- Come on, Duchess.

734
00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:08.880
Come on, let's get out of here.

735
00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.200
Well, girls, see you around.

736
00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.520
- We're on our way to Paris.
- Oh, how nice.

737
00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:18.800
- We're going to Paris ourselves.
- Why don't you join us?

738
00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.120
I think that's a splendid idea.

739
00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.120
Oh, no.

740
00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:26.280
Now, uh, you stand here, dear.

741
00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:30.120
And, uh, let's see.
You take this position.

742
00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.880
- Duchess, you'll do nicely here.
- Very good.

743
00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:35.360
And, you dear, you take this place.

744
00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.440
Now, that leaves Mr. O'Malley.

745
00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.960
- We can't leave him, can we?
- [giggling]

746
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.320
Mr. O'Malley, I think you
should be the rear end.

747
00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:50.760
Ready, everyone?
Now, think goose.

748
00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.520
Forward march.

749
00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:03.120
Mama? Do we have to waddle
like they do?

750
00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.600
Yes, dear. Think goose.

751
00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:10.880
When we get to Paris,
you must meet Uncle Waldo.

752
00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:12.800
Waldo?

753
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.480
Yes, he's our uncle.

754
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.080
We are to meet Uncle Waldo
at Le Petit Café.

755
00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:21.440
[Duchess] Le Petit Café?
Oh, that's that famous restaurant.

756
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.760
C'est magnifique.

757
00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.120
- [bird screaming]
- [man] Sacré bleu!

758
00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.120
Oh, he bit my finger!

759
00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:37.280
Get out. Go! Go, get out. Scram!

760
00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.280
Good riddance!

761
00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.600
[drunken mumbling]

762
00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:48.560
[hiccups]

763
00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:54.120
Why! Why, it's Uncle Waldo.

764
00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.200
- [Abigail] Uncle Waldo!
- [screams]

765
00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.240
Abigail! Amelia!

766
00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:01.560
My two favorite nooses. [hiccups]

767
00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:06.240
Uncle Waldo,
I do believe you've been drinking.

768
00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:10.080
Oh, dear. What happened
to your lovely tail feathers?

769
00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:14.040
[Waldo] Girls, it's outrageous.

770
00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.560
Why, you won't believe
what they tried to do

771
00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:20.040
to your poor old Uncle Waldo.

772
00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:23.920
[sobbing] Look. Look at this.

773
00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:27.360
"Prime country goose à la Provençale.

774
00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:30.560
Stuffed with chestnuts"?

775
00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:34.360
And "basted in... white wine."

776
00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.760
[hiccups]

777
00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:40.080
Basted? He's been marinated in it.

778
00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.520
Dreadful.

779
00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:45.600
Being British, I would have
preferred sherry.

780
00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.800
[all laughing]

781
00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:50.440
Sherry! Sherry.

782
00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:53.480
Oh! Oh, Uncle Waldo.

783
00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:57.320
- You're just too much.
- [Abigail] You mean he's had too much.

784
00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.800
- Abigail, Abigail.
- Yes, dear?

785
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.600
We'd best get Uncle Waldo to bed.

786
00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.800
I say, there...

787
00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:09.280
...what's all the whispering about, huh?

788
00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:11.080
- Shh!
- Oh! Whoo-hoo!

789
00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.800
Now, now, now, girls.

790
00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:16.480
Girls, don't shush your old Uncle Waldo.

791
00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:20.160
Why, you'll wake up
the whole neighborhood.

792
00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:21.520
[whoops loudly]

793
00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.560
- [Abigail] Sh. No!
- Neighborhood!

794
00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:26.120
Come along, Uncle Waldo.

795
00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.160
Oh, jeez, I think we'd better be going.

796
00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.480
Oh. Right-o, girls.

797
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:33.040
Birds of a feather must... [hiccups]

798
00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:34.480
...together.

799
00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.720
- That's "stick together."
- [giggling]

800
00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.800
- [Waldo] Oh, stick.
- [giggling]

801
00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:44.160
- [Waldo singing]
- Shush.

802
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.320
- [Waldo singing]
- [girls laughing]

803
00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:52.080
You know something?

804
00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:54.480
I like Uncle Waldo.

805
00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:57.800
Especially when he's marinated.

806
00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:04.400
Frou-Frou, here comes Edgar.

807
00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.760
Hurry, Roquefort,
hop aboard the motorcycle.

808
00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:09.040
And for goodness sakes, do be careful.

809
00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:18.520
Frou-Frou, tonight
Operation Catnapper will be completed.

810
00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:21.920
Wish me luck. Fisherman's luck.

811
00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.520
[engine starts]

812
00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:31.440
Bye, Frou-Frou. Oooh!

813
00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:47.440
[coughing and choking]

814
00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:51.080
I... Whoa!

815
00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:37.760
[snoring]

816
00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.120
[shoes squeaking]

817
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.040
- [shoes squeaking]
- Lafayette. Lafayette.

818
00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:55.280
- Listen.
- [squeaking]

819
00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:59.600
Oh, shucks, Napoleon, that ain't
nothin' but a little old cricket bug.

820
00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:02.400
It's squeaky shoes approaching.

821
00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.080
Oh, cricket bugs don't wear shoes.

822
00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.640
Hush your mouth.

823
00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.240
- [squeaking]
- Let's see.

824
00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:10.920
They're Oxford shoes.

825
00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:13.920
Size nine and a half.

826
00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:16.520
Hole in the left sole, it sounds like.

827
00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.720
- What color are they?
- They're black...

828
00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:20.960
Now, how would I know that?

829
00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:26.600
Hey! Now the squeaking has stopped.

830
00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:29.760
I still say it was
a little old cricket bug.

831
00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:33.920
I'm the leader. I'll decide what it was.

832
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.680
It was a little old cricket bug.

833
00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:40.440
I'll see ya in the morning, Napoleon.

834
00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:44.320
[sighing]

835
00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:47.680
[steady breathing]

836
00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.640
[snoring]

837
00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:12.360
That's my hat. I'm the leader.

838
00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.960
Well, shoot fire. Don't get sore at me.

839
00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:16.720
I ain't done nothin'.

840
00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.760
[mumbling]

841
00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:00.640
[groaning]

842
00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.600
Ooh. Oh.

843
00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:06.200
Ooh.

844
00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:08.400
[laughing]

845
00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:19.760
Mm, mm. That feels good, Lafayette.

846
00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:22.280
That's all right.

847
00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:24.280
Mm. Mm.

848
00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:25.680
Mm-mmm.

849
00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.600
Oooh.

850
00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:31.040
[groaning]
A little lower and faster there.

851
00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:34.040
I'm scratching as fast as I can.

852
00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:37.680
Oooh. Right there. That's good.

853
00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:39.120
Oooh.

854
00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:40.840
Oooh.

855
00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:45.720
[kissing]

856
00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:56.120
[snoring]

857
00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:15.080
It's so warm... and cosy.

858
00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:21.320
[horn sounding]

859
00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:26.440
[horn sounds loudly]

860
00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:30.160
- [Lafayette] Oooh.
- [Napoleon] Aaah!

861
00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.000
Oooh.

862
00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:37.520
What's going on? Lafayette,
what in tarnation you trying to do?

863
00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:40.360
Aw, I get blamed for everything.

864
00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:43.360
Wait a minute. Where's my hat?

865
00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:46.680
What? And somebody stole
my bumbershoot.

866
00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:49.320
Where's my beddy-bye basket?

867
00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:53.040
Whoever it is, is gonna get it
and get it good.

868
00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:56.360
[Lafayette] This time I get
the tender part.

869
00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.960
[Napoleon] Hush your mouth.
Now, come on.

870
00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:07.760
[shoes squeaking]

871
00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:14.720
Hey, Napoleon, it's them shoes again.

872
00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:16.840
Yeah, yeah, I hear 'em.

873
00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:21.200
Napoleon, I'm plumb goose-pimply scared.

874
00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:24.360
Now, this is no time to turn chicken.

875
00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.840
[grunting]

876
00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:36.240
I got a feelin' this case
is gonna bust wide open.

877
00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:37.960
- [straining]
- Whoo-hoo!

878
00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:39.440
[both scream]

879
00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:44.080
[stuttering] Did you see him?

880
00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:47.080
No, no, he sneaked up behind me
and tailgated me.

881
00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.720
Well, he didn't hurt me.
He hit me on the head.

882
00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:51.760
- Shh. Listen.
- [squeaking]

1058
01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:24.400
I could never leave her.

1059
01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:27.560
But... But Madame's...

1060
01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:30.480
Well, she's just another human.

1061
01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:33.120
You're just her house pets.

1062
01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:34.720
Oh, no, no.

1063
01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:37.760
We mean far more to her than that.

1064
01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.920
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear.

1065
01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.400
We just have to go home tomorrow.

1066
01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.440
[O'Malley] Yeah.

1067
01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:50.840
Well, I guess you know best.

1068
01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:53.840
But I'm gonna miss you, baby.

1069
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.840
[chuckles] And those kids...

1070
01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.480
- [sighing]
- Gee, I'm gonna miss them too.

1071
01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:03.000
Well, we almost had a father.

1072
01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.360
Yeah. [yawning]

1073
01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:07.600
Let's go back to bed.

1074
01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:13.560
Good night, Duchess.

1075
01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.400
Good night, Thomas.

1076
01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:41.440
Hey.

1077
01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:45.120
Meow!

1078
01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.240
What a classy neighborhood.

1079
01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:50.640
Dig these fancy wigwams.

1080
01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.040
Wigwams?

1081
01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.320
Are you sure we're on the right street?

1082
01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:57.320
Yes. Yes, let's hurry.
We're almost home.

1083
01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:01.760
Duchess! Kittens!
Hallelujah, they're back!

1084
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.040
Oh, no. Edgar!

1085
01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.000
I've got to do something, quick.

1086
01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:13.000
Oh, ha.

1087
01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:16.320
Edgar, old chap, get used to
the finer things in life.

1088
01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:19.600
Someday they're all going to be yours,

1089
01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:21.680
you sly old fox.

1090
01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:24.480
Oh!

1091
01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:26.960
Oh, he got me.

1092
01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:28.760
Hooray! We're home.

1093
01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.920
Wait for me, wait for me!

1094
01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:34.320
- [Marie] Me first, me first!
- [grunting]

1095
01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:38.040
- It's locked.
- Come on.

1096
01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.160
Let's all start meowing.

1097
01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.520
[meowing]

1098
01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.360
- It can't be them.
- The kittens.

1099
01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:50.360
Uh, why?

1100
01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.600
Don't come in!

1101
01:07:58.200 --> 01:07:59.720
Go away!

1102
01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:03.360
- Away!
- Look, there's Roquefort.

1103
01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.280
Hi, Roquefort!

1104
01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:07.080
[Berlioz] He's glad to see us.

1105
01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:11.160
[sighing] I don't know what to say.

1106
01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.920
I only wish that I...

1107
01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:19.200
Maybe just a short, sweet
goodbye would be easiest.

1108
01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:23.640
I'll never forget you, Thomas O'Malley.

1109
01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.240
Bye.

1110
01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:28.880
So long, baby.

1111
01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:32.720
Don't come in. Look out for Edgar!

1112
01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:43.400
Duchess, wherever have you been?

1113
01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:45.320
Look out for the...

1114
01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:48.560
- [meowing]
- ...sack.

1115
01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:53.560
Well... guess they
won't need me anymore.

1116
01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.760
You came back?

1117
01:08:58.520 --> 01:08:59.880
It just isn't fair.

1118
01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:02.800
[Madame] Edgar? Edgar, come quickly.

1119
01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:05.760
Coming, Madame, coming.

1120
01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:09.120
I'll take care of you later.

1121
01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:11.120
Oh, Edgar, they're back.

1122
01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:14.800
I heard them. Hurry, hurry, let them in.

1123
01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.920
Duchess? Kittens?

1124
01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.600
Come here, my darlings.

1125
01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:23.120
Where are you?

1126
01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:26.440
- Come on.
- Uh, allow me, Madame.

1127
01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:29.840
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

1128
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.480
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

1129
01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.480
His name is O... what?

1130
01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.760
[Duchess] His name is O'Malley.
O'Malley.

1131
01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.040
[Marie] Abraham de Lacy,
Giuseppe Casey...

1132
01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:42.000
[Duchess] Oh, never mind.
Just run, move, go get him!

1133
01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:43.960
Yes, yes, I'm on my way.

1134
01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.800
[Toulouse] I told you it was Edgar.

1135
01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:49.280
[Berlioz] Aw, shut up, Toulouse.

1136
01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:51.320
Oh, it's no use, Edgar.

1137
01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:56.560
I'm afraid it was just
the imagination of an old lady.

1138
01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:00.160
But I was so sure that I heard them.

1139
01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.600
I'm so sorry, Madame.

1140
01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:13.560
Mr. O'Malley!

1141
01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:19.640
Hey, stop!

1142
01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:22.960
[panting] Duchess. Kittens. In trouble.

1143
01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:24.360
Butler did it.

1144
01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.280
Duchess and kittens in trouble?

1145
01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:29.600
Look, you go get Scat Cat
and his gang of alley cats.

1146
01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.680
Alley cats?

1147
01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.320
But I'm a mouse.

1148
01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:35.360
Look, I'm gonna need help.

1149
01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.360
- You mean, you want me...?
- Move!

1150
01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:40.880
Just tell 'em O'Malley sent you,
and you won't have a bit of trouble.

1151
01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:49.240
No trouble, he said.

1152
01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:52.720
Well, that's easy for...
for what's-his-name to say.

1153
01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:56.400
He's got nine lives. I've only got one.

1154
01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:04.040
What's a little swinger like you
doing on our side of town?

1155
01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:08.560
Oh, please, I was sent here
for help by a cat.

1156
01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:11.240
This is outrageous. It's crazy.

1157
01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:14.080
[laughter]

1158
01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:20.920
But honest! He told me
just to mention his name.

1159
01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:24.400
So start mentioning name, rodent.

1160
01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.240
Oh, now, wait a minute, fellas.

1161
01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.680
[stuttering] Don't rush me.

1162
01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:30.240
His name is O'Toole.

1163
01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.080
I don't dig him. Strike one.

1164
01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:36.040
Oh, oh... O'Brien.

1165
01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.840
Strike two.

1166
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.600
Oh, boy.

1167
01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.440
You believe me... don't you?

1168
01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:44.240
Keep talkin', mousey.

1169
01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:46.720
How about O...

1170
01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.600
...Grady?

1171
01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:49.920
Huh?

1172
01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:52.600
Mousey, you just struck out.

1173
01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:55.760
Any last words?

1174
01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:58.280
Why did I listen to that O'Malley cat?

1175
01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:00.760
- O'Malley?
- O'Malley?

1176
01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.560
- O'Malley?
- Hold it, cats.

1177
01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:04.280
This little guy's on the level.

1178
01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:07.080
You're darn tootin' I'm on the level.

1179
01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:10.080
We didn't mean to ruffle you, squeaky.

1180
01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.960
Don't worry about me.
O'Malley needs help.

1181
01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.120
Duchess and kittens are in trouble.

1182
01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:17.240
Come on, cats, we gotta split.

1183
01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:20.880
Hey, wait for me!
You don't know the way!

1184
01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:44.680
[Edgar] Now, my little pesky pets,

1185
01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:47.920
you're going to travel first class.

1186
01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:50.760
In your own private compartment.

1187
01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:53.640
All the way to Timbuktu.

1188
01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:57.920
And this time... you'll never come back.

1189
01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.640
Oh, no, we've got to hurry.

1190
01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:03.680
The baggage truck will be here
any moment now.

1191
01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:05.720
[meowing]

1192
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.480
Ooh!

1193
01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:32.000
- Whoo-hoo. Oww!
- [crashing]

1194
01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:51.040
[whinnying]

1195
01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:55.720
[gasping]

1196
01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:57.480
[loud meowing]

1197
01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:02.360
Over there. They're in the trunk.

1198
01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.760
[meowing]

1199
01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.760
Quiet!

1200
01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:18.480
[noise stops]

1201
01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:23.600
[meowing continues]

1202
01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.200
Everybody out of here, fast.

1203
01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:33.040
You are going to Timbuktu,

1204
01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:36.680
if it's the last thing I do.

1205
01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:05.120
[man 1] Well, Mac,
this must be the trunk, eh?

1206
01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:09.040
[man 2] Yup. And she goes
all the way to Timbuktu.

1207
01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:11.800
Heave-ho.

1208
01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:20.280
[meowing and hissing]

1209
01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:23.760
[laughter]

1210
01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:38.560
Now, my pets, a little closer together.

1211
01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:41.080
Good. Good.

1212
01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:43.840
Look, Georges. What do you think?

1213
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.840
Very good, very good.

1214
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.080
But I think we should
get on with the will.

1215
01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:53.000
Yes, yes, of course,
but you know what to do.

1216
01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:55.760
Very well. Scratch one butler.

1217
01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:00.200
You know, Georges, if Edgar had
only known about the will,

1218
01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:03.760
I'm sure he never would have left.

1219
01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:07.120
Duchess, it's wonderful
to have you all back.

1220
01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:10.520
And I think this young man
is very handsome.

1221
01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:12.800
Shall we keep him in the family?

1222
01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.440
- [meowing]
- [Madame laughs]

1223
01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.480
Of course we will.

1224
01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:20.360
We need a man around the house.

1225
01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:23.440
And, Georges, we must be sure to provide

1226
01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:25.920
for their future little ones.

1227
01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:29.120
[Georges] Of course.
The more the merrier.

1228
01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:32.800
Now, don't move.

1229
01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:34.520
Smile.

1230
01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.560
