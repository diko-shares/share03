00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.020
10-86, possible 4-17. Baker, Henry.

2
00:01:23.226 --> 00:01:26.127
3000 block of Bagley, 4-17, 10-30.

3
00:01:27.797 --> 00:01:28.764
Get back!

4
00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:30.432
- I'll shoot her!
- Oh, my God!

5
00:01:30.634 --> 00:01:32.226
3-L-90. I repeat:

6
00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:35.893
3-L-90, request you notify hostage
negotiation team.

7
00:01:36.106 --> 00:01:38.506
Have them respond to my Location.

8
00:01:44.014 --> 00:01:46.414
- See anything?
- Get those cars out of here!

9
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:51.549
Suspect is a male Caucasian,
approximately--

10
00:01:51.756 --> 00:01:53.815
I'm a reporter.
How Long have you been here?

11
00:01:54.692 --> 00:01:57.126
Domestic or drugs?
Is that his girlfriend?

12
00:01:57.328 --> 00:01:59.023
- Get out of here.
- Who is it?

13
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.788
- Talk to me.
- Get him out of here.

14
00:02:01.398 --> 00:02:03.059
- Go on!
- I got my passes.

15
00:02:03.733 --> 00:02:05.564
- Shit.
- I have every right to be here.

16
00:02:05.769 --> 00:02:07.237
Where'd he go?

17
00:02:07.738 --> 00:02:10.901
Suspect has withdrawn into
the interior of the room.

18
00:02:11.108 --> 00:02:13.474
We no Longer have visual contact.

19
00:02:29.594 --> 00:02:31.721
That was my car.

20
00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:01.456
Holy--

21
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:13.530
Having a Little car trouble?

22
00:03:17.043 --> 00:03:18.908
That's a keen observation.

23
00:03:19.445 --> 00:03:21.037
I can help you.

24
00:03:23.382 --> 00:03:24.441
It's the Jag.

25
00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.214
You want me to drive home in your car?

26
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:30.150
I want you to take my car.

27
00:03:31.758 --> 00:03:34.283
I've had a lot of Luck Lately.
I don't need it.

28
00:03:34.927 --> 00:03:37.589
You're giving me a new Jaguar
and you don't want anything?

29
00:03:37.797 --> 00:03:40.426
I can prove it. Give me your card.

30
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.507
I'll be in touch.

31
00:03:52.712 --> 00:03:55.580
What, you want me to kill your
wife or something?

32
00:03:55.816 --> 00:03:56.805
No.

33
00:03:57.017 --> 00:03:58.848
Tempting, but, no.

34
00:03:59.053 --> 00:04:01.851
Call it generosity between
two strangers.

35
00:04:03.357 --> 00:04:06.121
Generosity? It's a Jaguar.

36
00:04:06.327 --> 00:04:08.887
You expect me to drive home
in a new Jaguar?

37
00:04:09.096 --> 00:04:11.395
- That's right.
- You're a freak!

38
00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:12.896
You are a freak.

39
00:04:13.101 --> 00:04:16.662
You want me to get in this car? No way!
It'll probably blow up.

40
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:20.203
That's real funny, bits and pieces of me
raining down in the street!

41
00:04:21.575 --> 00:04:24.442
You think I'm going near that thing,
you're nuts!

42
00:04:24.712 --> 00:04:26.475
Besides, I got a car.

43
00:04:29.017 --> 00:04:30.541
Sort of.

44
00:05:25.374 --> 00:05:26.739
What? You Like it?

45
00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:28.267
Cool blade, huh?

46
00:05:28.477 --> 00:05:31.470
- You want to see it?
- Keep it in your pants.

47
00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:34.311
Fag.

48
00:05:34.985 --> 00:05:38.011
- He's gonna kill you.
- I've got pepper spray.

49
00:06:24.802 --> 00:06:28.260
Apparently, none of you have ever
seen a new teacher before.

50
00:06:30.241 --> 00:06:31.469
I'm Mr. Simonet.

51
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:34.042
Welcome to the seventh grade.

52
00:06:34.246 --> 00:06:38.739
Middle school, that hellish, shaky
bridge you all must cross...

53
00:06:38.983 --> 00:06:43.920
...before you become members of that
undyingly enviable high school elite.

54
00:06:44.355 --> 00:06:47.325
You may think you can't cross
this bridge fast enough.

55
00:06:47.526 --> 00:06:52.463
You'd rather close your eyes and not
think about it until it's all over.

56
00:06:52.865 --> 00:06:55.197
Well, I'm here to tell you...

57
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.198
...that is not an option
in this class.

58
00:07:00.038 --> 00:07:01.266
Lateness.

59
00:07:03.842 --> 00:07:05.104
Tardiness.

60
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.939
To be late for your first class
on your first day of school.

61
00:07:09.147 --> 00:07:11.047
What does that indicate?

62
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.041
I'm having a bad hair day?

63
00:07:15.287 --> 00:07:18.313
Perhaps what it indicates is
a Lack of respect.

64
00:07:18.525 --> 00:07:21.858
You see, I'm going to be here
every day for you.

65
00:07:22.061 --> 00:07:26.293
And so I expect you to be here for me.

66
00:07:26.799 --> 00:07:29.528
On time, no excuses.

67
00:07:30.369 --> 00:07:31.199
Put that down.

68
00:07:32.104 --> 00:07:32.968
Wait.

69
00:07:35.508 --> 00:07:36.634
Now...

70
00:07:37.677 --> 00:07:40.544
...this class is social studies.

71
00:07:40.847 --> 00:07:44.613
That is you and the world. Yes.

72
00:07:44.817 --> 00:07:48.913
There is a world out there and even if
you don't want to meet it...

73
00:07:49.122 --> 00:07:52.581
...it's still going to hit you
right in the face.

74
00:07:53.227 --> 00:07:54.455
Believe me.

75
00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:00.088
Best start thinking about the world
now and what it means to you.

76
00:08:01.534 --> 00:08:05.163
What does the world mean to you?

77
00:08:07.041 --> 00:08:08.906
Come on! A Little class
participation.

78
00:08:09.109 --> 00:08:11.236
Is it just this class you
want to get out of?

79
00:08:11.445 --> 00:08:13.208
Your house, your street?

80
00:08:13.414 --> 00:08:17.009
Any further any of you want to go
than that? Yes?

81
00:08:17.284 --> 00:08:20.185
The mall. That's only two miles
away from me.

82
00:08:22.324 --> 00:08:24.382
Let me ask you another question.

83
00:08:24.725 --> 00:08:28.957
How often do you think about things
that happen outside of this town?

84
00:08:29.196 --> 00:08:32.597
Do you watch the news? Yes? No?

85
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.794
All right, so we're not global thinkers
yet, but why aren't we?

86
00:08:38.707 --> 00:08:40.607
Because we're 11.

87
00:08:41.276 --> 00:08:42.800
Good point. What's your name?

88
00:08:43.511 --> 00:08:44.341
Trevor.

89
00:08:44.546 --> 00:08:47.606
Maybe Trevor's right. Why should
we think about the world?

90
00:08:47.816 --> 00:08:51.273
After all, what does the world
expect of us?

91
00:08:51.652 --> 00:08:52.881
Expect?

92
00:08:53.121 --> 00:08:53.985
Of you.

93
00:08:54.556 --> 00:08:58.014
What does the world expect of you?

94
00:08:59.561 --> 00:09:00.653
Nothing.

95
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:03.561
Nothing.

96
00:09:04.366 --> 00:09:06.800
My God, boys and girls, he's right.

97
00:09:07.035 --> 00:09:08.264
Nothing.

98
00:09:08.804 --> 00:09:11.170
Here you are. You can't drive.
You can't vote.

99
00:09:11.374 --> 00:09:14.673
You can't go to the bathroom
without a pass. You're stuck...

100
00:09:15.411 --> 00:09:17.675
...right here in the seventh grade.

101
00:09:21.149 --> 00:09:22.480
But not forever...

102
00:09:23.118 --> 00:09:25.849
...because one day you'll be free.

103
00:09:30.226 --> 00:09:32.888
But what if on that day you're free...

104
00:09:33.295 --> 00:09:35.786
...you haven't prepared,
you're not ready...

105
00:09:35.998 --> 00:09:40.527
...and yet you Look around you
and you don't Like what the world is.

106
00:09:40.737 --> 00:09:42.637
What if the world...

107
00:09:43.473 --> 00:09:46.168
...is just a big disappointment?

108
00:09:46.909 --> 00:09:48.376
We're screwed.

109
00:09:48.644 --> 00:09:50.168
Unless....

110
00:09:51.447 --> 00:09:55.475
Unless you take the things that you
don't Like about this world...

111
00:09:55.719 --> 00:09:58.847
...and you flip them upside down right
on their ass.

112
00:09:59.056 --> 00:10:01.388
Don't tell your parents I
used that word.

113
00:10:01.792 --> 00:10:03.953
And you can start that...

114
00:10:04.494 --> 00:10:05.791
...today.

115
00:10:07.164 --> 00:10:10.065
This is your assignment.

116
00:10:10.301 --> 00:10:11.393
Extra credit.

117
00:10:11.602 --> 00:10:14.934
It goes on all year Long.

118
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.638
Wait a minute.
What's wrong with this?

119
00:10:19.843 --> 00:10:21.572
What's the matter? Yes?

120
00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:23.603
It's, Like, so....

121
00:10:25.082 --> 00:10:27.244
There must be a word to finish
that sentence.

122
00:10:27.485 --> 00:10:28.782
- Someone help her.
- Weird.

123
00:10:28.986 --> 00:10:30.214
Weird. Crazy.

124
00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:31.251
Hard.

125
00:10:31.456 --> 00:10:33.219
- Bummer.
- Bummer.

126
00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:35.085
Hard.

127
00:10:36.527 --> 00:10:40.258
How about possible?

128
00:10:42.467 --> 00:10:44.162
It's possible.

129
00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:48.868
The realm of possibility...

130
00:10:49.507 --> 00:10:53.671
...exists where? In each of you.

131
00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:57.343
Here.

132
00:10:58.684 --> 00:11:00.675
So you can do it.

133
00:11:01.353 --> 00:11:04.584
You can surprise us. It's up to you.

134
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.282
Or you can just sit back
and let it atrophy.

135
00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:12.460
Atrophy.

136
00:11:13.532 --> 00:11:17.730
If there is a word you hear that you
don't understand, there's a dictionary.

137
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.301
Look it up.

138
00:11:19.605 --> 00:11:23.473
And there are these dictionaries which
you will carry at all times...

139
00:11:23.709 --> 00:11:27.304
...because in this class, we're going
to Learn to Love words...

140
00:11:28.046 --> 00:11:30.572
...and their meanings.
Any questions?

141
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:32.210
Yeah.

142
00:11:32.719 --> 00:11:36.279
So, you'll Like, flunk us if we
don't change the world?

143
00:11:36.955 --> 00:11:38.820
No, I wouldn't do that.

144
00:11:39.725 --> 00:11:42.751
But you might just squeak by
with a "C".

145
00:11:46.866 --> 00:11:48.800
What'd you ever do to change
the world?

146
00:11:53.473 --> 00:11:55.737
Well, Trevor, I get a good
night's sleep.

147
00:11:55.975 --> 00:11:57.738
I eat a hearty breakfast.

148
00:11:57.977 --> 00:12:01.004
I show up on time...

149
00:12:02.749 --> 00:12:05.183
...and then I pass the buck to you.

150
00:12:08.688 --> 00:12:12.488
Now, I want you all to write your names
in these books and--

151
00:12:12.692 --> 00:12:13.920
What's your name?

152
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.422
Molly, all right. I want Molly to
Look up the word atrophy...

153
00:12:19.166 --> 00:12:21.100
...and tell the class what it means.

154
00:15:30.796 --> 00:15:33.856
No, we're not in Milwaukee.

155
00:15:35.234 --> 00:15:37.202
Straight to hell. Straight to hell.

156
00:15:37.403 --> 00:15:39.736
Four tequilas.
Who's having the fourth one?

157
00:15:39.973 --> 00:15:42.065
- You are.
- Not for me, thank you.

158
00:15:42.307 --> 00:15:45.902
- We bought it for you.
- Thank you so much. No thanks.

159
00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:47.908
- Why not?
- I promised my kid.

160
00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:51.416
I know, it's horrible.
You guys have fun.

161
00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:53.141
Wait, wait, wait. Here.

162
00:15:53.385 --> 00:15:54.375
Thank you.

163
00:15:54.587 --> 00:15:56.885
What are you doing, Junior?

164
00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:59.958
What are your doing, Jun?
What are you doing?

165
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.821
You got her now. You got her now.

166
00:16:02.062 --> 00:16:04.223
You got him now. You got him now.

167
00:16:06.066 --> 00:16:07.658
What time do you get off?

168
00:16:07.901 --> 00:16:09.664
If only I weren't married.

169
00:16:12.272 --> 00:16:13.899
He's married!

170
00:16:14.374 --> 00:16:16.842
I'm single! I'm single!

171
00:16:35.262 --> 00:16:37.161
- Hello?
- Hey.

172
00:16:39.866 --> 00:16:41.061
How'd it go?

173
00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:42.929
Are you there?
- Yeah.

174
00:16:43.137 --> 00:16:44.604
How'd it go?

175
00:16:44.872 --> 00:16:45.839
What?

176
00:16:46.107 --> 00:16:48.200
How'd it go?
How was your first day?

177
00:16:48.442 --> 00:16:49.466
Okay.

178
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.941
Trev, you got to speak up.
I can't hear you.

179
00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:58.114
Sorry I wasn't home. I had
a chance to pick up another shift.

180
00:16:59.387 --> 00:17:00.786
You mad at me?

181
00:17:04.058 --> 00:17:05.650
Trev, what are you doing?

182
00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.391
Nothing.

183
00:17:08.395 --> 00:17:09.623
You find the spaghetti?

184
00:17:12.567 --> 00:17:13.966
I'm eating it.

185
00:17:14.302 --> 00:17:15.291
Good.

186
00:17:15.804 --> 00:17:17.169
Come on, tell me what happened.

187
00:17:17.405 --> 00:17:18.736
I got to go.

188
00:17:29.318 --> 00:17:30.579
Spoon?

189
00:17:31.153 --> 00:17:32.347
Spoon.

190
00:21:54.424 --> 00:21:55.721
Mom?

191
00:21:57.226 --> 00:21:58.454
Mom!

192
00:22:00.997 --> 00:22:03.658
My friend's coming in to
take a shower, okay?

193
00:22:04.266 --> 00:22:05.528
Okay.

194
00:22:25.989 --> 00:22:27.854
That's not really breakfast.

195
00:22:29.193 --> 00:22:30.659
You don't eat breakfast.

196
00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.088
Well, Let's have some.

197
00:22:32.295 --> 00:22:35.355
I'll make some eggs.
I'll have some too.

198
00:22:38.067 --> 00:22:39.797
You sure you won't throw up?

199
00:22:40.871 --> 00:22:43.101
- What's that mean?
- What do you think?

200
00:22:43.307 --> 00:22:44.467
Tell me what it means.

201
00:22:44.675 --> 00:22:47.041
- You're sneaking it.
- I'm not sneaking anything.

202
00:22:47.244 --> 00:22:48.336
Okay.

203
00:22:50.681 --> 00:22:52.672
Wait, I'm sorry. You're right.

204
00:22:52.883 --> 00:22:55.512
- I want to talk.
- You want to Lie to me.

205
00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.654
I don't want to Lie, I want to talk.

206
00:22:57.855 --> 00:22:59.720
- Do what you want.
- I want us to get along.

207
00:22:59.923 --> 00:23:00.912
I'm sorry.

208
00:23:01.124 --> 00:23:02.955
I can't find the toilet paper.

209
00:23:03.393 --> 00:23:04.553
- Who are you?
- It's Jerry.

210
00:23:04.761 --> 00:23:06.695
Get out! Get out of my house!

211
00:23:06.897 --> 00:23:07.989
- Thanks a Lot.
- Get out!

212
00:23:08.198 --> 00:23:10.564
- Do you need money for the bus?
- No, I got it.

213
00:23:10.902 --> 00:23:12.426
You said he could take a shower.

214
00:23:12.637 --> 00:23:14.036
- I never said that!
- You did.

215
00:23:14.239 --> 00:23:16.332
I said to Let a strange man
into my bathroom?

216
00:23:16.541 --> 00:23:18.168
He's my friend.

217
00:23:18.376 --> 00:23:19.968
You can't have a friend Like that.

218
00:23:20.211 --> 00:23:22.338
- It's for my assignment.
- What assignment?

219
00:23:22.547 --> 00:23:25.276
You won't get it.
Mr. Simonet will get it.

220
00:23:25.482 --> 00:23:28.043
Who's Mr. Simonet?
Hey, I'm talking--

221
00:23:28.253 --> 00:23:30.118
He's my teacher.

222
00:23:57.415 --> 00:23:58.405
Mr. Simonet?

223
00:23:58.617 --> 00:24:00.744
Yes, I'm Eugene...

224
00:24:01.287 --> 00:24:02.777
...Simonet.

225
00:24:05.791 --> 00:24:08.089
- Hello.
- Hello.

226
00:24:09.762 --> 00:24:12.322
- What is this assignment?
- Excuse me?

227
00:24:12.531 --> 00:24:15.228
What did you say for my son to
Let a homeless man in my house?

228
00:24:17.737 --> 00:24:19.204
I have two problems.

229
00:24:19.439 --> 00:24:21.668
One, I've no idea what
you're talking about...

230
00:24:21.874 --> 00:24:23.535
...and two, I don't know who you are.

231
00:24:23.742 --> 00:24:27.542
Arlene McKinney. My boy is in your
social studies class? Trevor?

232
00:24:28.547 --> 00:24:29.913
Trevor.

233
00:24:30.116 --> 00:24:34.177
Yes, he's very attentive. He's very
exigent, which I Like.

234
00:24:35.822 --> 00:24:38.052
- Exigent. Challenging, testing.
- I know what it means.

235
00:24:38.258 --> 00:24:40.624
Why did my kid bring a bum home?

236
00:24:40.827 --> 00:24:42.089
- I have no idea.
- Bullshit!

237
00:24:42.295 --> 00:24:44.389
I don't know how he interpreted
the assignment.

238
00:24:44.599 --> 00:24:47.123
How do you think he interpreted it?

239
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.489
I don't know.

240
00:24:48.702 --> 00:24:51.865
If you want to know, why don't you
talk to your son?

241
00:24:52.072 --> 00:24:53.061
I talk to him.

242
00:24:53.273 --> 00:24:54.433
Really?

243
00:24:54.641 --> 00:24:58.634
Then why did you come down here to ask
me what the assignment is?

244
00:25:00.481 --> 00:25:02.244
It's not a state secret.

245
00:25:05.519 --> 00:25:07.282
Yeah? And?

246
00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:12.289
It's an assignment I give out at the
beginning of every year to inspire.

247
00:25:12.493 --> 00:25:14.357
I don't expect them to change the world.

248
00:25:14.561 --> 00:25:16.587
- You don't expect them to change--
- Excuse me.

249
00:25:16.831 --> 00:25:19.732
It's to get them to think,
not walk on water.

250
00:25:19.934 --> 00:25:23.028
An assignment they can't do?
What kind of teacher are you?

251
00:25:23.237 --> 00:25:25.068
I didn't say that.
They make attempts.

252
00:25:25.272 --> 00:25:27.604
Now and then they clean up graffiti--

253
00:25:27.842 --> 00:25:30.276
This is my kid. You don't know him.

254
00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.775
Tell him he can do something,
he'll believe you.

255
00:25:34.016 --> 00:25:36.348
And when he can't, it'll wipe him out.

256
00:25:36.551 --> 00:25:39.452
They ought to fire your ass
out of here right now.

257
00:25:40.922 --> 00:25:44.652
They probably won't do that because I
filled a very excellent quota.

258
00:25:44.859 --> 00:25:47.624
I'm just this side of parking in
the blue zone.

259
00:25:47.829 --> 00:25:52.061
You think you can do whatever you want
because your face is messed up?

260
00:25:53.535 --> 00:25:57.631
Why don't you put down in writing your
Little and Loud complaints...

261
00:25:57.839 --> 00:26:01.138
...and I'll make sure they get put
in the suggestion box.

262
00:26:04.747 --> 00:26:05.907
Jesus.

263
00:26:06.516 --> 00:26:08.177
You are really something.

264
00:26:08.384 --> 00:26:11.284
Thanks. I appreciate the euphemism.

265
00:26:11.486 --> 00:26:13.545
I've always wanted to be something.

266
00:26:20.863 --> 00:26:23.024
Can I help you with something, miss?

267
00:26:23.866 --> 00:26:25.163
No.

268
00:26:36.013 --> 00:26:40.005
Mr. Thorsen. Hold up, man!
I've been waiting all day for you.

269
00:26:40.216 --> 00:26:43.344
- Why won't you return my calls?
- We're not friends.

270
00:26:43.553 --> 00:26:46.283
I got the pink slip for the car.
Quite a stocking stuffer.

271
00:26:46.489 --> 00:26:49.323
- You can't accept it?
- No, that would make me a moron.

272
00:26:49.526 --> 00:26:51.790
I just want to know about
these instructions.

273
00:26:51.995 --> 00:26:53.690
Do what they say. Pay it forward.

274
00:26:53.897 --> 00:26:55.797
- Why?
- Because you've accepted the car.

275
00:26:55.999 --> 00:26:59.196
- You're obligated.
- What if I don't feel obligated?

276
00:26:59.403 --> 00:27:02.429
What if I take my new car, get some
hookers and drive to Mexico?

277
00:27:02.639 --> 00:27:03.662
I'll never know.

278
00:27:03.873 --> 00:27:06.104
What is this? Come on, for real.

279
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:08.801
An attack of total altruism
from a Litigator.

280
00:27:09.012 --> 00:27:10.240
I've got a meeting.

281
00:27:10.447 --> 00:27:12.608
I've got a story. Okay?

282
00:27:12.816 --> 00:27:15.250
A partner at Channing and Moss
is giving away cars?

283
00:27:15.486 --> 00:27:19.047
Tell me a reason or I'll make one up.
Mine will be more interesting.

284
00:27:19.256 --> 00:27:23.159
You've gone dotty, you're wearing
crystals, keeping too many cats at home?

285
00:27:25.163 --> 00:27:26.721
Look. Listen, please!

286
00:27:26.931 --> 00:27:28.990
My ex-wife has everything. Okay?

287
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.430
Plus, she's in a Lesbian relationship
just to piss me off.

288
00:27:32.669 --> 00:27:34.660
Help me out, please.

289
00:27:39.244 --> 00:27:41.212
My daughter has asthma.

290
00:27:41.513 --> 00:27:45.244
One night it was very bad,
the worst I'd ever seen it.

291
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:48.419
It was the middle of the night,
emergency room.

292
00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.413
We were waiting forever.
Couldn't get anyone to pay attention.

293
00:28:01.933 --> 00:28:04.026
Her inhaler doesn't seem
to be working.

294
00:28:04.235 --> 00:28:05.793
Mr. Parker, what happened?

295
00:28:06.004 --> 00:28:08.303
My sister, she stabbed me.

296
00:28:08.507 --> 00:28:10.737
- We were here first.
- Stab wounds first.

297
00:28:10.943 --> 00:28:13.503
- She can't breathe. She's scared.
- I will Let you know.

298
00:28:13.712 --> 00:28:15.441
Somebody has to see her.

299
00:28:15.714 --> 00:28:18.182
It's never been this bad.
Do something.

300
00:28:18.384 --> 00:28:19.942
Would you just sit down?

301
00:28:20.152 --> 00:28:23.953
I'm sorry. We've been here 4 hours.
You need to get a doctor.

302
00:28:24.157 --> 00:28:25.646
No. Wait.

303
00:28:28.661 --> 00:28:30.219
That's bullshit.
Help her right now.

304
00:28:30.429 --> 00:28:32.294
- Excuse me?
- Why you giving me shit?

305
00:28:32.498 --> 00:28:33.726
Ain't you got some oxygen?

306
00:28:33.933 --> 00:28:35.195
Let me get the supervisor.

307
00:28:35.401 --> 00:28:38.029
You don't need a supervisor.
You the supervisor today.

308
00:28:38.237 --> 00:28:41.298
You are the supervisor today.
You feel me on that?

309
00:28:41.508 --> 00:28:45.410
Take your ass down the hall, put the
girl on the tray and supervise her...

310
00:28:45.612 --> 00:28:48.240
...and get her some goddamn air.

311
00:28:48.748 --> 00:28:52.411
I got your back, sis. Bitch, you're
still here. Shit!

312
00:28:55.522 --> 00:28:58.286
Let go of my arm, man.
This ain't fair, man!

313
00:28:58.625 --> 00:29:00.991
Come on! Come on, man. Damn!

314
00:29:01.194 --> 00:29:02.627
I thanked him...

315
00:29:02.929 --> 00:29:07.298
...and there were specific orifices in
which I was told to shove my thanks.

316
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.559
He told me, "Just pay it forward."

317
00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:12.432
Three big favors for three other
people. That's it.

318
00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.835
So it's Like a pass-it-on thing, then.

319
00:29:15.042 --> 00:29:17.567
You and this Lowlife are in this chain
of do-gooders...

320
00:29:17.778 --> 00:29:21.304
...a kind of Mother Teresa conga Line?
That's a Little New-Agey for you.

321
00:29:21.514 --> 00:29:24.142
Sort of Tibetan? Are you in a cult?

322
00:29:25.051 --> 00:29:29.250
Mention my name, you'll be selling your
kidneys to pay for your Lawsuit.

323
00:29:29.457 --> 00:29:30.788
Cult.

324
00:29:31.325 --> 00:29:33.816
The guy! What was the guy's name?

325
00:29:34.028 --> 00:29:36.724
Sorry, I'm Late for my mass wedding.

326
00:30:05.994 --> 00:30:07.985
I know somebody's in here.

327
00:30:10.732 --> 00:30:12.360
I know you're there.

328
00:30:13.169 --> 00:30:15.932
Come out or I will find you
and shoot you.

329
00:30:16.138 --> 00:30:17.901
Please don't shoot.

330
00:30:20.242 --> 00:30:21.436
Please.

331
00:30:21.944 --> 00:30:23.605
You stay right there.

332
00:30:24.012 --> 00:30:27.004
If I see you move one--

333
00:30:32.922 --> 00:30:34.287
Please don't pick it up!

334
00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:36.754
Please don't! I'm not moving.

335
00:30:38.695 --> 00:30:39.957
Please.

336
00:30:42.597 --> 00:30:44.463
What are you doing to my truck?

337
00:30:45.969 --> 00:30:48.494
Let me show you. I'm just....

338
00:30:48.905 --> 00:30:51.032
I'm just going to open the door, okay?

339
00:31:01.819 --> 00:31:02.786
See?

340
00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:07.816
Might be easier for you to sell now.
Now that it works.

341
00:31:08.058 --> 00:31:09.888
I didn't ask for your help.

342
00:31:10.727 --> 00:31:12.558
You been Living in my garage?

343
00:31:12.762 --> 00:31:15.231
Not after tonight.

I got a handyman job at the Royal Motel.
They're giving me a room.

345
00:31:20.471 --> 00:31:21.836
You stay right there!

346
00:31:22.072 --> 00:31:24.233
Please, I don't Like guns.

347
00:31:25.676 --> 00:31:28.167
What is going on with you and my son?

348
00:31:28.412 --> 00:31:29.845
He wanted to help somebody.

349
00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.017
Wanted to get somebody back on their
feet, so he gave me a Little money.

350
00:31:34.252 --> 00:31:36.652
- He gave you money?
- Yes, ma'am.

351
00:31:36.987 --> 00:31:38.614
That's his savings.

352
00:31:40.157 --> 00:31:43.285
Well, it's clothes and shoes
and I got the job off it.

353
00:31:45.095 --> 00:31:46.825
You think you can keep it?

354
00:31:47.198 --> 00:31:50.099
Looks to me Like you've got yourself
a Little problem.

355
00:31:54.806 --> 00:31:56.273
I can Lick it.

356
00:31:56.941 --> 00:31:59.307
How's that supposed to happen
all of a sudden?

357
00:31:59.844 --> 00:32:01.710
You ever been on the street?

358
00:32:04.282 --> 00:32:06.273
My mom took us pretty close.

359
00:32:06.851 --> 00:32:10.651
Well, you can't know, not until
you're Looking at a dumpster.

360
00:32:11.456 --> 00:32:16.393
But when you climb in the first time,
and pull the newspapers over you...

361
00:32:16.694 --> 00:32:20.358
...that's when you know you've
messed your Life up.

362
00:32:20.966 --> 00:32:25.426
Somebody comes along Like your son
and gives me a Leg up...

363
00:32:26.338 --> 00:32:27.805
...I'll take it.

364
00:32:28.207 --> 00:32:30.368
Even from a kid, I'll take it.

365
00:32:35.681 --> 00:32:38.343
I can't mess up again or I'll be dead.

366
00:32:39.919 --> 00:32:42.717
I appreciate that you're trying to pay
back Trevor--

367
00:32:42.922 --> 00:32:44.913
I'm not allowed to pay back Trevor.

368
00:32:45.157 --> 00:32:48.719
- Then what is it you're doing?
- I'm paying it forward.

369
00:32:51.164 --> 00:32:53.029
I know you want me to go.

370
00:32:55.202 --> 00:32:56.362
I'll go.

371
00:32:58.737 --> 00:33:00.671
What's paying it forward?

372
00:33:01.707 --> 00:33:03.231
That's me.

373
00:33:04.978 --> 00:33:07.913
And that's three people.

374
00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:14.753
And I'm going to help them, but it has
to be something really big...

375
00:33:15.989 --> 00:33:19.926
...something they can't do
by themselves.

376
00:33:20.428 --> 00:33:22.396
So I do it for them...

377
00:33:23.798 --> 00:33:26.891
...then they do it for
three other people.

378
00:33:28.902 --> 00:33:30.494
That's nine.

379
00:33:31.171 --> 00:33:34.698
And I do three more....

380
00:33:34.908 --> 00:33:37.935
That's 27, so--

381
00:33:38.179 --> 00:33:42.707
I'm not really good at math but it
gets big really fast. You know?

382
00:33:48.723 --> 00:33:50.350
All right, all right, all right.

383
00:33:50.558 --> 00:33:52.220
A Little articulation, please.

384
00:33:52.427 --> 00:33:54.451
- Yes?
- I think it's a good idea.

385
00:33:54.662 --> 00:33:56.596
- Shawn?
- It's stupid.

386
00:33:56.797 --> 00:33:58.128
- Adam?
- It's the honor system.

387
00:33:58.599 --> 00:34:00.658
- People blow off the honor system.
- So what?

388
00:34:00.868 --> 00:34:02.631
Just because you do.

389
00:34:03.304 --> 00:34:08.004
Trevor, the class thinks that you've
come up with an overly Utopian idea.

390
00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:10.144
Look that word up in a minute.

391
00:34:12.447 --> 00:34:14.415
Like a perfect world?

392
00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.317
So?

393
00:34:21.455 --> 00:34:25.586
So what put this idea in your head?

394
00:34:28.997 --> 00:34:29.929
Because....

395
00:34:30.132 --> 00:34:33.101
Everything sucks.

396
00:34:34.269 --> 00:34:35.702
He talked to you about this?

397
00:34:36.271 --> 00:34:38.467
We've had our discussions.

398
00:34:40.243 --> 00:34:41.972
But you don't have to worry...

399
00:34:42.178 --> 00:34:45.341
...because I'll tell him we
can't talk no more.

400
00:34:47.283 --> 00:34:48.806
No, don't do that.

401
00:34:50.919 --> 00:34:52.409
Would you Like a cup of coffee?

402
00:34:55.692 --> 00:34:56.681
Yes, ma'am.

403
00:34:56.893 --> 00:34:58.360
Okay.

404
00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:10.599
I called the president
to talk about pollution.

405
00:35:10.808 --> 00:35:13.436
But my mom said now they'll
put us on some List...

406
00:35:13.644 --> 00:35:15.271
...so she hung up.

407
00:35:15.678 --> 00:35:19.944
For this assignment, I put up recycling
fliers at two supermarkets.

408
00:35:20.149 --> 00:35:21.946
I'm going to put up a website
in Chinese.

409
00:35:22.151 --> 00:35:25.553
It'll tell all the kids in China to jump
up and down at the same time.

410
00:35:32.863 --> 00:35:35.593
The goal being to knock
the Earth off its axis.

411
00:35:35.833 --> 00:35:37.232
- Yeah.
- Thank you. Sit down.

412
00:35:39.336 --> 00:35:43.432
Well, your ideas are as surprising
as they are variegated.

413
00:35:43.674 --> 00:35:46.507
Add that to your List of words
to Look up.

414
00:35:46.844 --> 00:35:50.678
But I want to focus for a moment on one
project we heard today.

415
00:35:51.248 --> 00:35:56.186
I've been teaching for many years and
it's the first new idea that also...

416
00:35:56.955 --> 00:36:01.756
...requires an extreme act of faith in
the goodness of people.

417
00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:06.993
Trevor has made an attempt to
interact with the world...

418
00:36:07.198 --> 00:36:09.132
...and that was the assignment.

419
00:36:09.367 --> 00:36:13.269
And if I were an effusive person given
to easy praise...

420
00:36:13.471 --> 00:36:15.166
...I would call that...

421
00:36:15.807 --> 00:36:17.240
...admirable.

422
00:36:17.442 --> 00:36:20.468
The words from today:
Utopian, enigma, quantum.

423
00:36:20.712 --> 00:36:22.942
Add variegated.
I want you to go home--

424
00:36:28.187 --> 00:36:30.519
- Hey, Mr. Simonet.
- Hello.

425
00:36:40.932 --> 00:36:42.764
Were you just being nice?

426
00:36:43.703 --> 00:36:44.931
About what?

427
00:36:45.938 --> 00:36:47.530
About my idea.

428
00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:51.774
Do you think it's good or were you
just being teachery?

429
00:36:53.312 --> 00:36:54.279
Teachery?

430
00:36:55.448 --> 00:36:56.437
Bullshitting.

431
00:36:58.485 --> 00:37:00.919
Do I strike you as someone
falsely nice?

432
00:37:01.688 --> 00:37:02.780
No.

433
00:37:03.557 --> 00:37:05.615
You're not even really all that nice.

434
00:37:08.494 --> 00:37:12.328
Well, it was a slip-up
and it will not happen again.

435
00:37:17.804 --> 00:37:18.930
What?

436
00:37:21.675 --> 00:37:23.233
What happened to your face?

437
00:37:40.627 --> 00:37:43.357
Did you draw the short straw today,
Trevor?

438
00:37:44.865 --> 00:37:48.029
It's not a very pertinent subject to
social studies, is it?

439
00:37:48.469 --> 00:37:50.369
Go and tell them that's
what I said.

440
00:37:50.571 --> 00:37:52.004
Tell who?

441
00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.764
I'll see you tomorrow.

442
00:38:19.201 --> 00:38:22.659
- You know where Jerry is?
- Over there in 15.

443
00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:56.265
It's more product.

444
00:38:56.472 --> 00:38:57.962
Who is it?

445
00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.130
It's Trevor.

446
00:39:00.342 --> 00:39:02.401
I'm Looking for Jerry.

447
00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:05.977
Jerry's not here.

448
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:09.274
When will he be back?

449
00:39:09.486 --> 00:39:13.320
He's not coming back.
Now get out of here.

450
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:20.390
Jerry?

451
00:39:20.598 --> 00:39:22.531
Get out of here!

452
00:39:24.767 --> 00:39:27.133
Please come out, Jerry.

453
00:40:44.849 --> 00:40:48.808
I remember in 1976 there were those
programs in the school system...

454
00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:52.616
- ...and now, all that's gone.
- I gotta go.

455
00:40:55.227 --> 00:40:58.560
You ran out of class this morning.
I wanted to talk to you.

456
00:41:51.451 --> 00:41:53.009
- Hello.
- Hello.

457
00:41:53.854 --> 00:41:54.913
Come in.

458
00:42:01.996 --> 00:42:03.725
Trevor's not feeling good.

459
00:42:03.931 --> 00:42:06.125
I'm sorry.
What's the matter?

460
00:42:06.333 --> 00:42:07.800
Just a tummy ache.

461
00:42:08.201 --> 00:42:09.668
Do you want to come in?

462
00:42:09.936 --> 00:42:11.598
Sure. Thank you.

463
00:42:13.441 --> 00:42:15.807
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

464
00:42:16.944 --> 00:42:19.003
- It's a very beautiful home.
- Thank you.

465
00:42:19.213 --> 00:42:21.147
Have you lived in Vegas your
whole Life?

466
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:22.509
Yeah.

467
00:42:29.358 --> 00:42:34.294
I told him if you wanted to talk to me
I would come to the school.

468
00:42:35.463 --> 00:42:38.330
Mrs. McKinney, I didn't ask to see you.

469
00:42:39.367 --> 00:42:41.062
Well, Trevor said you did.

470
00:42:41.804 --> 00:42:44.534
Yeah and he gave me a note from you...

471
00:42:46.041 --> 00:42:48.236
...which you didn't write.

472
00:42:48.477 --> 00:42:50.502
He gave you a note from me?

473
00:42:52.681 --> 00:42:56.549
Oh, God, that's horrible.
He's been so--

474
00:42:56.752 --> 00:42:59.449
- No, I didn't mean you.
- No explanation required.

475
00:42:59.656 --> 00:43:01.384
- Don't elaborate.
- It's not personal.

476
00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:03.558
- I'm used to this.
- Would you stop?

477
00:43:03.892 --> 00:43:06.383
Can we just rewind here a Little bit?

478
00:43:06.995 --> 00:43:11.830
I obviously didn't realize
how much Trevor Likes you.

479
00:43:12.334 --> 00:43:15.668
That's nothing that we can't discuss
on parent-teacher night.

480
00:43:16.005 --> 00:43:17.939
Then why did you come?

481
00:43:19.209 --> 00:43:22.440
Why didn't you just tell me to
come to the school?

482
00:43:25.515 --> 00:43:28.074
Because you came to the school...

483
00:43:29.085 --> 00:43:30.848
...to talk to me about your son...

484
00:43:31.554 --> 00:43:33.522
...and I behaved Like a--

485
00:43:33.723 --> 00:43:35.020
An asshole?

486
00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:37.952
Sorry.

487
00:43:38.862 --> 00:43:40.796
Is that too trailer-trash a word?

488
00:43:42.799 --> 00:43:44.995
How's "rat bastard" sit with you?

489
00:43:45.202 --> 00:43:46.066
It's pretty good.

490
00:43:46.937 --> 00:43:48.564
- "Dickhead"?
- Oh, I Like that.

491
00:43:51.976 --> 00:43:53.204
Look, I'm--

492
00:44:07.057 --> 00:44:09.252
I made all this food.

493
00:44:10.427 --> 00:44:12.156
It's just sitting here.

494
00:44:16.668 --> 00:44:19.501
I really don't know who else to
talk to about him.

495
00:44:22.273 --> 00:44:24.673
- This is good.
- Thanks.

496
00:44:24.909 --> 00:44:27.139
I don't understand.
This is summer school?

497
00:44:28.779 --> 00:44:31.248
Why do you think Trevor stopped
talking to you?

498
00:44:31.449 --> 00:44:32.848
I don't know.

499
00:44:33.752 --> 00:44:35.413
He seems mad.

500
00:44:36.488 --> 00:44:39.252
Seventh grade is difficult,
but he seems happy at school.

501
00:44:40.926 --> 00:44:43.417
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's fine.

502
00:44:43.929 --> 00:44:45.191
How much do you see him?

503
00:44:45.931 --> 00:44:48.025
- As much as I can.
- How much is that?

504
00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:53.469
I'm not doing a bunch of skanky guys
instead of spending time with my son.

505
00:44:54.239 --> 00:44:55.968
I got two jobs.

506
00:44:57.776 --> 00:45:00.176
Right. I meant that.

507
00:45:00.612 --> 00:45:02.581
Couldn't have just been a question.

508
00:45:06.919 --> 00:45:10.286
Mrs. McKinney, do you think there
might be something...

509
00:45:10.523 --> 00:45:13.492
...outside of school that might be
bothering him?

510
00:45:14.727 --> 00:45:16.126
I don't know.

511
00:45:18.364 --> 00:45:21.356
I'm going to have to consult
my spirit guides here.

512
00:45:21.567 --> 00:45:23.865
You tell me Trevor's withholding
from you...

513
00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:27.801
...but won't tell me anything specific,
and you want me to divine why.

514
00:45:28.274 --> 00:45:32.005
Divine why?
You always talk Like that?

515
00:45:32.211 --> 00:45:33.236
Yes.

516
00:45:33.447 --> 00:45:35.938
You go to some big fancy school?

517
00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:37.576
Yes.

518
00:45:37.784 --> 00:45:40.309
Think you could stop rubbing
my nose in it?

519
00:45:46.292 --> 00:45:47.623
Is there a father?

520
00:45:48.094 --> 00:45:50.120
He doesn't Live here anymore.

521
00:45:50.664 --> 00:45:52.256
I don't know where he is.

522
00:45:52.466 --> 00:45:54.491
I know what that's Like.

523
00:45:55.102 --> 00:45:58.902
Arlene, I've called you five times.

524
00:45:59.106 --> 00:46:00.095
- Bonnie.
- No, Listen.

525
00:46:00.307 --> 00:46:04.038
You don't call your sponsor once in
a while, you don't have a sponsor.

526
00:46:04.479 --> 00:46:06.777
This is Eugene Simonet.

527
00:46:07.649 --> 00:46:09.640
You're not supposed to date for
a year.

528
00:46:09.851 --> 00:46:12.284
- It isn't a date.
- No, I'm Trevor's teacher.

529
00:46:12.686 --> 00:46:13.880
We're having a conference.

530
00:46:15.522 --> 00:46:16.819
We're done.

531
00:46:17.024 --> 00:46:18.286
Were done.

532
00:46:37.546 --> 00:46:39.172
How could you do that to me?

533
00:46:39.681 --> 00:46:41.672
Write a Letter to him, sign my name?

534
00:46:41.883 --> 00:46:45.444
- Why'd you have to mess everything up?
- I didn't mess this up.

535
00:46:45.653 --> 00:46:48.679
What were you doing?
Standing at the door Listening?

536
00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:51.985
- What happened to your stomachache?
- Why? You always Lie.

537
00:46:52.194 --> 00:46:54.992
This wasn't my fault.
This was embarrassing.

538
00:46:55.197 --> 00:46:57.097
I did something good
and you don't know it.

539
00:46:57.299 --> 00:46:59.199
Honey, Listen.

540
00:47:00.235 --> 00:47:04.171
You can't just put two people together
and make them Like each other.

541
00:47:04.373 --> 00:47:06.898
You only Like people you
can get drunk with.

542
00:47:08.944 --> 00:47:11.037
You're waiting for him to come back.

543
00:47:11.246 --> 00:47:12.907
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are!

544
00:47:13.115 --> 00:47:14.343
No, I'm not!

545
00:47:14.583 --> 00:47:17.245
- Your father's not getting his foot--
- That's what you always say.

546
00:47:17.453 --> 00:47:19.444
- I mean it now.
- You always mean it.

547
00:47:19.655 --> 00:47:22.591
What do you want me to say?
I say it, I mean it.

548
00:47:22.792 --> 00:47:25.818
When he's around you don't care
what happens to me.

549
00:47:26.062 --> 00:47:27.529
You don't even know I'm in the house.

550
00:47:27.731 --> 00:47:29.722
- That's not true.
- It's true.

551
00:47:29.933 --> 00:47:31.594
I Love you.

552
00:47:31.801 --> 00:47:32.790
I Love you.

553
00:47:33.002 --> 00:47:34.299
I'm doing the best I can.

554
00:47:34.503 --> 00:47:35.970
Don't Love me.
I hate the way you Look.

555
00:47:36.171 --> 00:47:37.570
Trevor, you need to stop.

556
00:47:37.773 --> 00:47:39.071
I hate that you're my mother.

557
00:49:29.755 --> 00:49:31.882
Trev, I'm going to come in, okay?

558
00:49:42.301 --> 00:49:44.236
You said that an hour ago.

559
00:49:45.706 --> 00:49:48.402
Do you understand my kid is missing?

560
00:49:50.409 --> 00:49:53.640
If I had a car I'd be out
Looking for him!

561
00:50:05.659 --> 00:50:07.627
What time do you think he took off?

562
00:50:07.928 --> 00:50:11.591
I don't know.
I'm sorry to do this to you.

563
00:50:11.832 --> 00:50:14.427
Bonnie wasn't home.
The cops wouldn't come.

564
00:50:14.636 --> 00:50:17.195
And my friends are all drunks.

565
00:50:17.404 --> 00:50:19.634
- It's okay.
- And so am I.

566
00:50:20.174 --> 00:50:21.732
I'm a drunk too.

567
00:50:25.746 --> 00:50:29.079
I believe some people refer to
that as "in recovery."

568
00:50:38.293 --> 00:50:39.726
Where are you going?

569
00:51:06.355 --> 00:51:07.583
Got enough?

570
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:11.418
Need a ticket somewhere? Come on,
I'll get you a ticket.

571
00:51:11.626 --> 00:51:13.059
Come with me. I'll get you a ticket.

572
00:51:13.261 --> 00:51:15.627
I'll get you a ticket,
you son of a bitch!

573
00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:17.560
Honey, are you okay?

574
00:51:38.154 --> 00:51:41.145
For the rest of my Life, I can
never be as sorry...

575
00:51:41.357 --> 00:51:44.019
...as I am for what I did to you.

576
00:51:52.002 --> 00:51:53.629
I didn't drink.

577
00:51:54.237 --> 00:51:56.671
I wanted to, but I didn't.

578
00:52:06.116 --> 00:52:08.414
You got no reason to trust me...

579
00:52:09.753 --> 00:52:13.086
...and I know you don't want to hear
any more promises...

580
00:52:13.923 --> 00:52:15.982
...so I'm just gonna tell you
the truth.

581
00:52:18.928 --> 00:52:20.453
I have a problem.

582
00:52:22.099 --> 00:52:25.000
I have a really bad problem.

583
00:52:26.203 --> 00:52:27.830
I've got to stop.

584
00:52:31.175 --> 00:52:33.234
And if you can be with me on this...

585
00:52:33.443 --> 00:52:38.279
...if you can think it's possible
that I can do it...

586
00:52:39.784 --> 00:52:41.945
...then I think maybe I can.

587
00:52:43.654 --> 00:52:45.087
If you just...

588
00:52:46.691 --> 00:52:49.387
...try a Little bit and help--

589
00:53:11.783 --> 00:53:12.772
You're still here?

590
00:53:12.984 --> 00:53:14.815
I hope it's okay.

591
00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:17.011
- He's asleep.
- Good, okay.

592
00:53:17.222 --> 00:53:18.985
How did you know where he was?

593
00:53:19.558 --> 00:53:23.188
Well, kids, they either hitchhike
or they take a bus.

594
00:53:23.396 --> 00:53:25.364
- Listen--
- You're welcome.

595
00:53:26.666 --> 00:53:27.927
No, you don't have to.

596
00:53:28.133 --> 00:53:31.796
- I understand--
- Wait. Goddamn, I want to thank you.

597
00:53:34.272 --> 00:53:35.637
Thank you.

598
00:53:35.974 --> 00:53:37.169
You're welcome.

599
00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:42.775
- Wasn't quite worth it, was it?
- No.

600
00:53:43.516 --> 00:53:47.145
I was wondering, do you want to come
back here sometime?

601
00:53:47.353 --> 00:53:49.014
Have dinner with me?

602
00:53:53.427 --> 00:53:58.193
I'm not entirely sure
that would be appropriate.

603
00:53:59.031 --> 00:54:01.795
Okay. I understand.

604
00:54:02.602 --> 00:54:04.297
- Good night.
- Good night.

605
00:54:15.516 --> 00:54:18.280
Why'd you do that man
the favor, Sidney?

606
00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:21.488
No, it's Like three favors, player.

607
00:54:21.688 --> 00:54:23.211
You got to do three.

608
00:54:23.456 --> 00:54:26.051
I'll do the other two here
for my folks.

609
00:54:26.293 --> 00:54:28.022
A Lot of brothers need favors in here.

610
00:54:28.228 --> 00:54:30.128
But who told you to do it?

611
00:54:33.734 --> 00:54:36.430
It's Like this idea I got.

612
00:54:38.172 --> 00:54:39.571
You gonna put this on TV?

613
00:54:39.808 --> 00:54:42.333
How did you come up with
an idea Like that?

614
00:54:43.645 --> 00:54:45.340
Man, it's Like....

615
00:54:46.247 --> 00:54:50.148
It's Like the world is a shithole.
Excuse my French and shit.

616
00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:51.578
And it's Like...

617
00:54:52.653 --> 00:54:55.087
...I just thought, Like, boom!

618
00:54:55.323 --> 00:54:58.258
Like the whole shit could be,
Like, better.

619
00:54:59.894 --> 00:55:01.759
It didn't start with anyone else?

620
00:55:02.697 --> 00:55:04.562
No, nigger.
That shit came from here.

621
00:55:04.766 --> 00:55:07.360
The shit came from my head.
I can't Lie.

622
00:55:07.569 --> 00:55:12.234
I been through some heavy-ass shit.

623
00:55:12.975 --> 00:55:15.705
But not no more,
because it changed me.

624
00:55:15.911 --> 00:55:17.537
And I'm changing this place, man.

625
00:55:17.745 --> 00:55:20.543
I mean, people are Listening to me.

626
00:55:20.748 --> 00:55:22.739
People are staying clean.

627
00:55:25.053 --> 00:55:29.684
I mean, it's Like some cosmic
Aristotle shit. You feel me?

628
00:55:30.526 --> 00:55:32.585
- Yeah.
- Yeah, no doubt.

629
00:55:32.795 --> 00:55:35.059
- I feel you.
- No doubt, dog, no doubt.

630
00:55:35.564 --> 00:55:38.055
The thing is, Sidney...

631
00:55:40.436 --> 00:55:43.770
...somebody else is saying
that pay it forward was their idea.

632
00:55:45.674 --> 00:55:46.436
Who?

633
00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:52.672
I think you know who.

634
00:55:55.384 --> 00:55:56.373
That bitch?

635
00:55:57.286 --> 00:55:58.879
She a Lying-ass bitch.

636
00:55:59.089 --> 00:56:01.956
She's a Lying bitch.
She's got your head.

637
00:56:02.158 --> 00:56:04.217
She makes a pretty good case,
though, Sid.

638
00:56:04.427 --> 00:56:05.985
That old crusty bag Lady?

639
00:56:06.196 --> 00:56:08.994
This is all from me.
All from my heart, dog.

640
00:56:09.199 --> 00:56:12.895
Sidney, it doesn't matter if you got
it from the Lady or not.

641
00:56:13.102 --> 00:56:14.661
You're the one paying it forward.

642
00:56:14.871 --> 00:56:17.567
In prison, no Less.
The parole board will eat that up.

643
00:56:19.576 --> 00:56:21.806
- Oh, the parole board.
- The parole board.

644
00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:26.449
Oh, snap, yo. You good, man.

645
00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:29.245
It's Like a carrot for
the mouse and shit.

646
00:56:30.488 --> 00:56:34.822
No doubt. It's too bad my parole don't
come up for another year, B.

647
00:56:38.296 --> 00:56:41.628
What if I can make it so your parole
comes up next month?

648
00:58:00.279 --> 00:58:01.677
Hello.

649
00:58:02.882 --> 00:58:04.975
Oh, hello.

650
00:58:06.886 --> 00:58:08.410
Did you know I worked here?

651
00:58:09.822 --> 00:58:11.619
No, I didn't. Really.

652
00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:16.556
Just dropped in for
a Little game of craps?

653
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.696
No, I Like that coffee shop.

654
00:58:23.303 --> 00:58:24.964
They have good food.

655
00:58:26.106 --> 00:58:28.539
Yeah, they got good pancakes.

656
00:58:29.709 --> 00:58:30.835
Yeah.

657
00:58:31.711 --> 00:58:32.905
Fluffy.

658
00:58:35.115 --> 00:58:38.107
- Want me to bring you back something?
- Oh, no, thanks.

659
00:58:38.352 --> 00:58:41.344
- I get off in an hour.
- Really?

660
00:58:42.189 --> 00:58:43.884
Yeah, really.

661
00:58:47.561 --> 00:58:51.191
Well, if you were going to eat
anyway then....

662
00:58:53.301 --> 00:58:55.292
If you wanted, maybe....

663
00:58:56.804 --> 00:58:58.863
If you were hungry, we could....

664
00:58:59.773 --> 00:59:02.367
We could, if you were,
if you want to...

665
00:59:05.847 --> 00:59:07.314
...eat something...

666
00:59:09.117 --> 00:59:10.550
...sometime.

667
00:59:15.657 --> 00:59:17.488
Give me a seven iron, please.

668
00:59:17.692 --> 00:59:18.818
Yes, sir.

669
00:59:30.705 --> 00:59:32.172
May I help you?

670
00:59:33.308 --> 00:59:35.208
I am not stalking the governor, Jordy.

671
00:59:36.144 --> 00:59:37.840
Shit. Chandler.

672
00:59:39.014 --> 00:59:41.847
You scared me. You Look Like crap.
What are you doing here?

673
00:59:42.051 --> 00:59:44.849
- I want to talk to him, Jordan.
- Your questions piss him off.

674
00:59:45.054 --> 00:59:46.919
- Is that why I got the bounce?
- He won't talk to you.

675
00:59:47.123 --> 00:59:49.057
- Tell him I'm a candygram.
- Stop it.

676
00:59:49.258 --> 00:59:52.591
I've been sitting on a story for
2 years about a party he had.

677
00:59:52.795 --> 00:59:57.255
The clean-up crew found syringes,
size 12 high heels, animal droppings.

678
00:59:57.466 --> 00:59:59.366
That can't be right, can it?

679
01:00:00.936 --> 01:00:02.426
You really had this, you'd have used it.

680
01:00:02.671 --> 01:00:04.969
Bullshit. His friends in high places
had me kill it...

681
01:00:05.174 --> 01:00:08.235
...but since I got fired,
I'm not feeling that Loyal.

682
01:00:09.646 --> 01:00:12.171
- What do you want?
- Four million dollars.

683
01:00:13.650 --> 01:00:15.550
I'm kidding, man. Relax.

684
01:00:17.053 --> 01:00:19.077
A phone call.
I just need a phone call.

685
01:00:19.288 --> 01:00:22.883
I need a massage for a friend's
parole date. That's it.

686
01:00:28.965 --> 01:00:31.433
- They kept me "0 minutes over.
- Did you call him?

687
01:00:31.635 --> 01:00:34.968
I couldn't remember the name of the
restaurant. I remember the hotel--

688
01:00:35.172 --> 01:00:38.734
If you're Late he thinks
it means you don't respect him.

689
01:00:38.943 --> 01:00:39.773
What?

690
01:00:39.977 --> 01:00:43.140
If you're Late, he'll think it means
you don't respect him.

691
01:00:51.254 --> 01:00:52.221
Wear this.

692
01:00:52.422 --> 01:00:55.415
- I want to wear the green dress.
- You Look Like a vampire in that.

693
01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.184
I got to take a shower.

694
01:00:57.395 --> 01:00:59.056
- What?
- I smell horrible.

695
01:00:59.263 --> 01:01:02.721
No, you don't! You smell good.
You smell Like roses or something.

696
01:01:02.934 --> 01:01:05.562
Let me just wash under my arms.
Are you sure?

697
01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:06.862
Yeah, I'm sure.

698
01:01:17.181 --> 01:01:20.446
Don't interrupt him in
the middle of a sentence.

699
01:01:20.985 --> 01:01:22.452
Am I supposed to raise my hand?

700
01:01:22.687 --> 01:01:25.247
- Get me my shoes. Those sandals.
- No, these.

701
01:01:25.456 --> 01:01:27.322
I'm not wearing those.
They're too sexy.

702
01:01:27.526 --> 01:01:29.221
You're Late. You owe him.

703
01:01:29.428 --> 01:01:32.591
- I owe him? Who are you?
- Go.

704
01:01:34.633 --> 01:01:37.329
No stupid jokes! He's not
that kind of person.

705
01:01:37.536 --> 01:01:41.563
Thank you very much. Where's the phone?
I got to call for a cab.

706
01:01:41.773 --> 01:01:44.139
If I take a bus, I'll be
another hour Late.

707
01:01:44.376 --> 01:01:47.539
- Stop yapping.
- I've got to call for a cab.

708
01:01:50.282 --> 01:01:51.579
Oh, my God!

709
01:01:53.118 --> 01:01:55.586
Oh, my God. You're just about....

710
01:01:55.787 --> 01:01:58.120
You're the greatest son in the world!

711
01:01:58.324 --> 01:02:01.521
Okay, you have to go.
Here, here.

712
01:02:01.728 --> 01:02:02.922
Go, go.

713
01:02:03.596 --> 01:02:05.928
- Lock both doors!
- I will.

714
01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:11.069
- I Love you!
- Love you too, Mom.

715
01:02:35.862 --> 01:02:37.454
I respect you!

716
01:02:38.998 --> 01:02:40.590
They kept me Late at work...

717
01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.565
...and then I got on the bus to go
home and change, which was stupid.

718
01:02:43.771 --> 01:02:45.762
I'm sorry, but I was all the way--

719
01:02:47.508 --> 01:02:49.100
You're right on time.

720
01:03:03.357 --> 01:03:04.551
I'm sorry.

721
01:03:20.175 --> 01:03:23.576
I was Living in Vegas. One night I
was walking down the street.

722
01:03:23.778 --> 01:03:25.939
Minding my own. Wasn't doing
nothing to nobody.

723
01:03:26.581 --> 01:03:28.515
I was just on my way to church.

724
01:03:30.785 --> 01:03:34.346
Out of nowhere these five Bloods just
peeled out of a truck.

725
01:03:34.556 --> 01:03:37.719
And one of them, man,
was real black.

726
01:03:38.193 --> 01:03:41.094
Man, I start swinging one by one
Like, "Nigger, take that!"

727
01:03:41.296 --> 01:03:43.764
Like Ali on them bitches.
I was like....

728
01:03:44.566 --> 01:03:46.501
"What's up, nigger, what's up?"

729
01:03:47.236 --> 01:03:51.104
All five of them got up
and started chasing me, man.

730
01:03:51.307 --> 01:03:53.104
"We going to kill you, Crip."

731
01:03:53.309 --> 01:03:55.607
I was like,
"You can't catch me, Blood."

732
01:03:56.578 --> 01:04:00.070
Then, man, all of a sudden,
out of nowhere...

733
01:04:00.281 --> 01:04:02.614
...that's when I ran into
this old lady.

734
01:04:02.918 --> 01:04:04.783
That's who you want to know about.

735
01:04:15.431 --> 01:04:16.557
Shit!

736
01:04:18.168 --> 01:04:20.864
Hey, you in trouble?

737
01:04:22.572 --> 01:04:24.664
- What?
- Get in.

738
01:04:26.075 --> 01:04:27.372
Get in?

739
01:04:27.576 --> 01:04:29.168
Come on, get in.

740
01:04:33.083 --> 01:04:34.243
Shit!

741
01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:23.226
What are we doing?

742
01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:27.197
Whatever we want.

743
01:05:29.874 --> 01:05:30.863
Damn!

744
01:05:31.075 --> 01:05:35.809
You think I'm going for your dried-up
crusty ass? Whatever.

745
01:05:36.014 --> 01:05:39.211
Shoot. I smell better than you do.

746
01:05:40.185 --> 01:05:41.379
Yeah, all right.

747
01:05:42.187 --> 01:05:44.587
All right, so what?
What you want?

748
01:05:46.124 --> 01:05:47.557
Don't matter...

749
01:05:47.758 --> 01:05:51.195
...because you ain't going to do it.

750
01:05:53.565 --> 01:05:56.796
You damn right about that. Shit.

751
01:05:58.704 --> 01:06:00.865
Hey, not in my car.

752
01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.140
Shit, not in my car.

753
01:06:03.442 --> 01:06:05.307
Oh, my bad. My bad.

754
01:06:05.577 --> 01:06:09.537
This is your pad? You don't want me
to jack up your pretty curtains.

755
01:06:09.749 --> 01:06:12.047
Son of a bitch.

756
01:06:12.252 --> 01:06:16.381
I paid it forward for a hophead
son of a bitch.

757
01:06:17.656 --> 01:06:20.147
You paid it what? I didn't hear that.

758
01:06:21.326 --> 01:06:25.229
I ain't going to tell you because your
ass ain't good enough to touch it.

759
01:06:25.431 --> 01:06:27.592
Oh, my ass ain't good enough, huh?

760
01:06:30.637 --> 01:06:32.332
Now you gonna tell me.

761
01:06:35.008 --> 01:06:37.910
You gonna tell me.

762
01:06:38.112 --> 01:06:42.207
An old bat Living in her car in Las
Vegas tells you about pay it forward?

763
01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:45.942
She ain't want to, but I wouldn't
stop until she Let it out.

764
01:06:46.152 --> 01:06:49.144
What I really want to know is why?

765
01:06:49.355 --> 01:06:51.414
Why did you pay it forward?

766
01:06:52.425 --> 01:06:57.329
Because don't nobody tell me what
I can and can't touch.

767
01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.725
You're not supposed to date
for a year.

768
01:07:01.936 --> 01:07:03.369
They're not dates.

769
01:07:03.604 --> 01:07:05.071
Seven dinners. What are they?

770
01:07:05.272 --> 01:07:08.331
- It's a couple of adults sitting down.
- Does he pay?

771
01:07:08.541 --> 01:07:11.375
- He pays for everything.
- Did anybody ask you?

772
01:07:11.612 --> 01:07:13.910
- He doesn't know many people.
- He Likes her.

773
01:07:14.114 --> 01:07:16.674
- So?
- He fixed your TV remote.

774
01:07:16.884 --> 01:07:20.149
- That's an engagement ring.
- And he doesn't drink.

775
01:07:20.354 --> 01:07:23.346
Don't you got to pee? Look.

776
01:07:25.627 --> 01:07:28.221
- I need a smoke.
- Yeah. Over there.

777
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:32.157
- So has he kissed you?
- No, no, no, no.

778
01:07:32.367 --> 01:07:34.130
Does he want to?

779
01:07:35.336 --> 01:07:37.566
Sometimes I think he does.

780
01:07:38.806 --> 01:07:41.139
He can't really want to
or he would've.

781
01:07:42.244 --> 01:07:43.404
Do you want him to?

782
01:07:45.313 --> 01:07:46.507
I don't know.

783
01:07:48.350 --> 01:07:50.181
It's just taking forever.

784
01:07:51.386 --> 01:07:54.822
You ever gotten to know somebody
before you went to bed with him?

785
01:08:01.364 --> 01:08:04.093
- Is that bad?
- It's pathetic.

786
01:08:12.742 --> 01:08:14.175
Well, good night.

787
01:08:17.046 --> 01:08:18.741
Do you want to come in?

788
01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:22.549
And stay?

789
01:08:26.322 --> 01:08:27.312
Come in.

790
01:08:30.693 --> 01:08:32.786
Trevor's inside the house.

791
01:08:32.995 --> 01:08:35.259
Well, he sleeps Like the dead.

792
01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:40.060
I don't want to make it any
harder for you.

793
01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:44.231
You're supposed to wait a year.
Isn't that what Bonnie said?

794
01:08:44.441 --> 01:08:45.931
Okay.

795
01:08:51.982 --> 01:08:53.506
I can't.

796
01:08:58.722 --> 01:09:00.246
I'm sorry.

797
01:09:01.525 --> 01:09:03.686
No. I don't mean I can't.

798
01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:08.563
It's just....

799
01:09:09.333 --> 01:09:10.630
What?

800
01:09:14.539 --> 01:09:16.530
This is complicated.

801
01:09:18.576 --> 01:09:22.945
I get it. It's okay to say you
don't Like me that way.

802
01:09:27.117 --> 01:09:29.278
Is that what you think it is?

803
01:09:30.054 --> 01:09:31.544
It's okay.

804
01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:37.485
How could you ever think that?

805
01:10:14.299 --> 01:10:15.391
What?

806
01:10:16.436 --> 01:10:17.926
What is it?

807
01:10:44.097 --> 01:10:47.624
- And you're doing this because?
- I need more Links.

808
01:10:47.967 --> 01:10:50.902
You're spending $300 to find
an old Lady...

809
01:10:51.137 --> 01:10:53.571
...so you can sell a story for $300.

810
01:10:53.807 --> 01:10:56.867
It's a news magazine feature. It's
not something you wipe your ass with.

811
01:10:57.076 --> 01:11:00.409
You have a Lovely way of
expressing yourself.

812
01:11:00.647 --> 01:11:03.811
Do me a favor.
Don't change the Locks on me, okay?

813
01:11:04.218 --> 01:11:06.379
Chris? What are you hoping this'll be?

814
01:11:06.587 --> 01:11:08.987
You know, something that clears a check.

815
01:11:10.524 --> 01:11:12.185
Are you sure that's all?

816
01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:16.123
I drank the Last of the coffee.
Please put it on the List.

817
01:11:21.235 --> 01:11:22.259
Bye.

818
01:11:45.326 --> 01:11:46.816
Who's there?

819
01:11:49.965 --> 01:11:51.933
- Do you Look down on me?
- What?

820
01:11:52.133 --> 01:11:54.158
- Do you Look down on me?
- No.

821
01:11:54.402 --> 01:11:57.132
I don't talk Like you. I haven't
read the stuff you read.

822
01:11:57.339 --> 01:11:59.068
That's not pertinent,
and you know it.

823
01:11:59.274 --> 01:12:01.936
Don't talk to me Like that!

824
01:12:02.911 --> 01:12:06.439
I'm sorry, but that's the way I talk.
Words are all I have.

825
01:12:06.649 --> 01:12:07.638
Why?

826
01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:10.943
Why, because you think you Look
Like shit?

827
01:12:11.152 --> 01:12:14.144
I don't care about your burns,
if that's what they are.

828
01:12:14.356 --> 01:12:16.984
- Is that what they are?
- Yes.

829
01:12:17.192 --> 01:12:21.687
Okay, well, whatever happened to you,
you Look good to me.

830
01:12:26.302 --> 01:12:27.234
Well, you Look good to me too.

831
01:12:27.436 --> 01:12:29.495
Okay, so?

832
01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:35.171
So I've never been here before.

833
01:12:35.777 --> 01:12:38.542
Okay, so you're scared.
I'm scared too.

834
01:12:38.781 --> 01:12:41.716
Listen, bad things have happened
to me, okay?

835
01:12:41.951 --> 01:12:45.011
I can't take my shirt off with a guy
without five beers...

836
01:12:45.221 --> 01:12:47.246
...but I want that with you.

837
01:12:47.456 --> 01:12:50.152
More than I'm scared, I want that.

838
01:13:04.173 --> 01:13:05.800
You don't see me.

839
01:13:08.312 --> 01:13:09.677
My Life....

840
01:13:13.817 --> 01:13:17.253
My Life is familiar. My Life is....

841
01:13:17.588 --> 01:13:19.055
It's manageable.

842
01:13:19.256 --> 01:13:22.020
It's manageable. Every day.

843
01:13:22.893 --> 01:13:25.055
I have a thing I do every day.

844
01:13:25.263 --> 01:13:26.992
It's all I've ever known.

845
01:13:27.198 --> 01:13:30.098
And it's a routine and as Long
as I have that...

846
01:13:30.334 --> 01:13:33.667
...as Long as I have that, I'm okay.

847
01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:35.599
If I don't have it, I'm Lost.

848
01:13:35.839 --> 01:13:39.537
So is that all you want?
Your goddamn manageable day?

849
01:13:39.744 --> 01:13:41.439
- It's what I have.
- It isn't.

850
01:13:41.679 --> 01:13:44.273
- Is it what you want?
- Yes!

851
01:13:44.515 --> 01:13:45.948
I don't believe you.

852
01:13:51.222 --> 01:13:53.087
Okay. That's the best I got.

853
01:13:53.291 --> 01:13:54.953
- It's not about you.
- Yes, it is!

854
01:13:55.194 --> 01:13:58.856
Something's been offered to you here
and you don't want it.

855
01:13:59.063 --> 01:14:00.724
Maybe you're scared to get rejected.

856
01:14:00.932 --> 01:14:03.332
Well I can't reject you.
You're too quick for me.

857
01:14:29.428 --> 01:14:31.623
You didn't call me a fag, did you?

858
01:14:36.935 --> 01:14:38.095
Look what I found.

859
01:14:38.303 --> 01:14:40.635
Give me that! That's my asthma spray!

860
01:14:40.839 --> 01:14:43.206
- Shut up!
- Stop it!

861
01:14:43.410 --> 01:14:44.877
- Stay still!
- Stop! Help me!

862
01:14:45.078 --> 01:14:46.340
- Hold still!
- Stop!

863
01:14:51.051 --> 01:14:52.517
Hey, McKinney.

864
01:14:53.085 --> 01:14:54.017
Come here.

865
01:14:54.687 --> 01:14:56.177
Let's hang out.

866
01:14:57.257 --> 01:14:59.885
Help me, please.

867
01:15:00.093 --> 01:15:01.651
Screw it. Come on.

868
01:15:03.129 --> 01:15:05.063
Let me go! Let me go!

869
01:15:25.518 --> 01:15:27.213
You cut my class.

870
01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:31.187
It's been four days.

871
01:15:32.727 --> 01:15:34.217
What's been four days?

872
01:15:35.329 --> 01:15:38.389
Why haven't you called my mother?
It's been four days.

873
01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:47.697
I don't know.

874
01:15:50.511 --> 01:15:51.944
Neither does she.

875
01:16:00.355 --> 01:16:01.822
Hey, what's the matter?

876
01:16:07.696 --> 01:16:09.493
Pay it forward didn't work.

877
01:16:10.665 --> 01:16:12.360
I couldn't even do it.

878
01:16:18.006 --> 01:16:19.837
I was gonna help Adam.

879
01:16:24.946 --> 01:16:26.504
Help Adam do what?

880
01:16:27.716 --> 01:16:29.343
Not get beat up.

881
01:16:30.519 --> 01:16:32.579
But I crapped out and I Let him.

882
01:16:36.692 --> 01:16:38.353
I Let him get beat.

883
01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:42.556
No. you didn't.
You didn't Let him get beat.

884
01:16:42.764 --> 01:16:44.254
It happened.

885
01:16:45.033 --> 01:16:47.400
Sometimes there's nothing we can do.

886
01:16:50.273 --> 01:16:51.501
- It's not fair.
- I know--

887
01:16:51.707 --> 01:16:54.437
No. You don't know.

888
01:16:56.212 --> 01:16:57.873
You should call my mother.

889
01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:00.207
You could do something if you wanted.

890
01:17:01.651 --> 01:17:04.382
- Why are you chicken?
- I'm not chicken.

891
01:17:04.588 --> 01:17:07.250
Something's gonna happen,
then it'll be too Late.

892
01:17:10.893 --> 01:17:12.918
What's gonna happen?
What do you mean?

893
01:17:14.697 --> 01:17:16.130
He'll come back.

894
01:17:18.602 --> 01:17:20.092
Who will come back?

895
01:17:21.071 --> 01:17:22.800
Hey, who will come--?

896
01:17:28.812 --> 01:17:30.177
Your dad.

897
01:17:35.587 --> 01:17:37.486
Your dad will come back?

898
01:17:40.257 --> 01:17:41.246
And...

899
01:17:44.428 --> 01:17:47.329
...what will happen when he
comes back, Trevor?

900
01:17:51.002 --> 01:17:52.697
Will he hurt you?

901
01:17:58.877 --> 01:18:00.674
Will he hurt her?

902
01:18:07.552 --> 01:18:09.315
Not if someone's there...

903
01:18:11.456 --> 01:18:13.117
...instead of him.

904
01:18:22.268 --> 01:18:23.360
Trevor, it's...

905
01:18:23.969 --> 01:18:26.870
...complicated for me now.

906
01:18:30.808 --> 01:18:33.276
Is the world just shit?

907
01:18:36.682 --> 01:18:38.582
No, it isn't.

908
01:18:42.221 --> 01:18:43.848
You did good work.

909
01:18:44.156 --> 01:18:46.522
Look at me.
I'm proud of you, Trevor.

910
01:18:46.892 --> 01:18:48.450
I'm proud of you.

911
01:18:52.565 --> 01:18:54.658
And anyway, for what it's worth...

912
01:18:55.735 --> 01:18:58.567
...I'm grading you on the effort,
not the result.

913
01:19:03.342 --> 01:19:05.242
I don't care about the grade.

914
01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:23.128
I just wanted to see if the world
would really change.

915
01:20:08.309 --> 01:20:09.572
Come in.

916
01:22:08.133 --> 01:22:09.064
Trevor!

917
01:22:09.867 --> 01:22:11.164
- It worked!
- Oh, God.

918
01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:18.165
- Does he always get up early?
- What?

919
01:22:18.376 --> 01:22:19.604
He just saw me.

920
01:22:19.811 --> 01:22:21.472
- It's okay.
- I'm his teacher.

921
01:22:21.713 --> 01:22:23.442
Now you have to pay it forward too.

922
01:22:23.648 --> 01:22:24.876
Eugene!

923
01:22:25.383 --> 01:22:27.351
You should still call me Mr. Simonet.

924
01:22:27.552 --> 01:22:28.712
You had a sleepover.

925
01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.047
- Go back to bed.
- Why?

926
01:22:30.256 --> 01:22:32.224
It's too early and I got to
get to school.

927
01:22:32.424 --> 01:22:34.915
- No, it's a Sunday.
- It's a Sunday?

928
01:22:35.127 --> 01:22:36.457
It's a Sunday?

929
01:22:36.661 --> 01:22:38.060
Stay. Mom will make breakfast.

930
01:22:38.263 --> 01:22:41.926
I have a schedule that you
don't know about every Sunday.

931
01:22:42.133 --> 01:22:44.499
Will you take care of him?
I'll call you Later.

932
01:22:44.736 --> 01:22:46.500
Don't be a stranger!

933
01:22:47.273 --> 01:22:48.171
You Like him?

934
01:24:12.994 --> 01:24:14.359
Lady, come on.

935
01:24:14.795 --> 01:24:15.784
Go away.

936
01:24:16.230 --> 01:24:18.460
I'm not going to hurt you, Lady.

937
01:24:18.666 --> 01:24:19.861
Here, take it.

938
01:24:20.068 --> 01:24:22.366
It's a nice thought
but it's not what I want.

939
01:24:24.606 --> 01:24:25.902
What are you doing?

940
01:24:26.107 --> 01:24:27.665
I'm not going to hurt you!

941
01:24:30.711 --> 01:24:33.111
Oh, my God. Listen to me.

942
01:24:33.748 --> 01:24:36.946
Nothing's this important.
Come down here.

943
01:24:37.185 --> 01:24:38.152
What are you doing?

944
01:24:38.353 --> 01:24:40.787
What do you care anyway?

945
01:24:41.023 --> 01:24:42.422
Because I owe somebody a favor.

946
01:24:43.258 --> 01:24:44.316
Not me.

947
01:24:44.526 --> 01:24:45.993
Why not you?

948
01:24:46.194 --> 01:24:48.719
You know, a minute ago...

949
01:24:48.930 --> 01:24:52.923
...all I could think about
was getting my next fix.

950
01:24:53.135 --> 01:24:57.629
And then I saw you
and I changed my thinking.

951
01:24:57.839 --> 01:25:00.137
Oh, please. Go away.

952
01:25:00.375 --> 01:25:02.468
Trust me. I'm not worth it.

953
01:25:02.978 --> 01:25:04.206
Why is that?

954
01:25:05.047 --> 01:25:06.913
- For God's sake.
- Come on, tell me.

955
01:25:07.116 --> 01:25:08.913
Why are you not worth it?

956
01:25:10.553 --> 01:25:14.114
Trust me. You wouldn't understand.

957
01:25:14.891 --> 01:25:18.156
Are you kidding me?
You think I Live at the Ritz?

958
01:25:21.898 --> 01:25:24.162
Have a cup of coffee with me.

959
01:25:26.235 --> 01:25:27.293
What?

960
01:25:35.244 --> 01:25:36.836
Do me a favor.

961
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:41.011
Save my Life.

962
01:25:49.692 --> 01:25:51.717
Get him, get him! Off the ropes!

963
01:25:52.328 --> 01:25:53.728
He missed him!

964
01:25:54.998 --> 01:25:56.226
He's dead!

965
01:25:58.836 --> 01:26:01.066
Come on, bleed, dude.

966
01:26:01.872 --> 01:26:02.839
Give him a DDT.

967
01:26:03.741 --> 01:26:05.538
- What?
- It's gonna be a DDT.

968
01:26:05.743 --> 01:26:07.233
Drop him on his ass!

969
01:26:08.078 --> 01:26:10.172
I'm worried about you.
That's the DDT.

970
01:26:10.382 --> 01:26:11.314
- Hear me?
- He's dead!

971
01:26:11.516 --> 01:26:14.417
- He's paralyzed, get out of the ring.
- You can't get out of the ring.

972
01:26:14.619 --> 01:26:16.176
He can. He has to get a chair.

973
01:26:16.387 --> 01:26:18.821
A chair?

974
01:26:22.192 --> 01:26:23.022
Slow motion.

975
01:26:28.266 --> 01:26:30.530
Trevor, when did you become
so violent?

976
01:26:31.202 --> 01:26:34.262
Take me to a match. You get
splattered in the front row.

977
01:26:34.472 --> 01:26:35.734
I don't want to be splattered.

978
01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:38.568
It'll be your
birthday present to me.

979
01:26:38.977 --> 01:26:42.174
You know what you're getting?
A new encyclopedia.

980
01:26:43.047 --> 01:26:44.014
Leather bound.

981
01:26:45.650 --> 01:26:48.483
Thucydides History of
the Peloponnesian War.

982
01:26:48.686 --> 01:26:51.314
No, I'm getting you 51
crackling volumes.

983
01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:55.893
There'll be pop quizzes every day on
the development of cotton farms.

984
01:26:56.095 --> 01:26:57.119
Hi, Arlene.

985
01:27:44.344 --> 01:27:45.971
You can't stay here, Ricky.

986
01:27:46.213 --> 01:27:47.407
I know.

987
01:27:48.548 --> 01:27:51.608
Look, I know what we had was
a nightmare, Arlene.

988
01:27:52.385 --> 01:27:54.910
- But I did it.
- You did what?

989
01:27:55.722 --> 01:27:58.954
I knew I couldn't come back
unless I was sober.

990
01:28:01.395 --> 01:28:02.919
It's the truth.

991
01:28:03.731 --> 01:28:07.928
Five months, two weeks and four days
are the truth.

992
01:28:09.402 --> 01:28:11.996
- Where you been?
- What does it matter?

993
01:28:12.239 --> 01:28:14.333
I knew I had to change.

994
01:28:15.243 --> 01:28:19.475
- Are you sober?
- Yeah, I got sober staying right here.

995
01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:21.409
Well, you're stronger than me.

996
01:28:21.616 --> 01:28:23.607
Can you just stop for a minute?

997
01:28:24.151 --> 01:28:25.175
Please?

998
01:28:25.419 --> 01:28:28.013
Can we just sit down and talk?

999
01:29:47.504 --> 01:29:48.493
God.

1000
01:29:48.706 --> 01:29:50.367
I'm sorry.

1001
01:29:50.574 --> 01:29:51.734
What are you doing here?

1002
01:29:52.076 --> 01:29:55.772
- I want you to understand.
- No explanation required.

1003
01:29:55.979 --> 01:29:58.311
Please don't talk to me Like that.

1004
01:29:58.948 --> 01:30:03.545
We had 13 years in, Eugene. He's sober
now. We've never been sober together.

1005
01:30:03.821 --> 01:30:04.753
I wish you Luck.

1006
01:30:04.955 --> 01:30:08.049
I feel Like I've got to
give him a chance.

1007
01:30:08.258 --> 01:30:10.726
A chance? A chance for what?

1008
01:30:11.395 --> 01:30:13.192
To change.

1009
01:30:13.397 --> 01:30:15.524
To try to make up for Lost time.

1010
01:30:15.733 --> 01:30:19.101
To take Trevor to ball games?
Do "daddy" things with him?

1011
01:30:19.304 --> 01:30:21.794
Yeah, he promised to try.

1012
01:30:22.006 --> 01:30:23.974
- What should I do?
- Be smart.

1013
01:30:24.174 --> 01:30:25.607
He's his father.

1014
01:30:25.809 --> 01:30:27.401
He impregnated you, Arlene.

1015
01:30:27.611 --> 01:30:30.136
In what other way has he
been a father?

1016
01:30:30.347 --> 01:30:33.316
Unless knocking somebody around
is a new family value.

1017
01:30:33.517 --> 01:30:36.248
What do you mean?
He never touched Trevor.

1018
01:30:36.554 --> 01:30:38.715
Oh, that's right, only you.

1019
01:30:39.457 --> 01:30:42.915
He only took it out on you.
That's so much better.

1020
01:30:46.264 --> 01:30:47.788
What did Trevor tell you?

1021
01:30:47.998 --> 01:30:49.260
Enough.

1022
01:30:50.101 --> 01:30:53.832
Secrets Like that shouldn't be kept.
What good does it do Trevor?

1023
01:30:54.039 --> 01:30:56.337
Ricky never meant to hit me.
We were drunk!

1024
01:30:56.541 --> 01:30:58.839
Christ!
What is it with women Like you?

1025
01:30:59.544 --> 01:31:02.513
Is that something you tell yourself?
"It's okay he beat me."

1026
01:31:02.714 --> 01:31:03.908
"Trevor's okay."

1027
01:31:04.115 --> 01:31:07.552
Trevor Locked himself in a bathroom
and he can't breathe...

1028
01:31:07.753 --> 01:31:09.948
...and he's praying that it will stop!

1029
01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:13.556
- Trevor never went through that!
- You know what Trevor went through?

1030
01:31:13.926 --> 01:31:15.290
How do you know?

1031
01:31:15.527 --> 01:31:19.395
How do you know the next time after
you, he doesn't come for Trevor?

1032
01:31:19.631 --> 01:31:21.862
I know what I'm talking about, Arlene.

1033
01:31:22.068 --> 01:31:25.902
My father got on his knees
and begged my mother...

1034
01:31:26.105 --> 01:31:29.233
...and my mother, she always
took him back.

1035
01:31:29.442 --> 01:31:30.602
I never understood it.

1036
01:31:30.810 --> 01:31:34.610
She'd cover the bruises and the cuts
and she'd take him back...

1037
01:31:35.514 --> 01:31:38.575
...because he begged and he cried.

1038
01:31:39.052 --> 01:31:41.282
Ask me what happened after
he came back.

1039
01:31:41.488 --> 01:31:44.388
You wanted to know what happened to me!
Now ask me!

1040
01:31:44.590 --> 01:31:47.821
- I don't Like this.
- "Did he hurt you?" Ask!

1041
01:31:49.261 --> 01:31:50.455
Did he hurt you?

1042
01:31:51.497 --> 01:31:53.227
Not for Long.

1043
01:31:53.433 --> 01:31:56.368
By 13 I was gone. I ran away.

1044
01:31:56.570 --> 01:32:00.506
But I missed her, so I had to go back
and see her.

1045
01:32:00.807 --> 01:32:02.638
So one night I did.

1046
01:32:03.777 --> 01:32:07.474
Ask what happened. "What happened that
night you came back, Eugene?"

1047
01:32:07.682 --> 01:32:08.614
What happened?

1048
01:32:08.916 --> 01:32:11.713
He was there, drunk as usual.

1049
01:32:11.918 --> 01:32:13.783
Only this time, I wasn't the same.

1050
01:32:13.987 --> 01:32:18.287
I was 16 years old and I was no Longer
afraid of him.

1051
01:32:18.525 --> 01:32:20.186
And when I Looked him in the eye...

1052
01:32:20.427 --> 01:32:25.331
...and told him if he ever touched her
again, I would kill him, he knew.

1053
01:32:25.633 --> 01:32:28.466
He knew that he would never exist
for me again.

1054
01:32:30.138 --> 01:32:32.163
And I'm standing in front of the house.

1055
01:32:32.373 --> 01:32:34.136
I'm screaming for her to come out.

1056
01:32:34.342 --> 01:32:37.310
I'm telling her she doesn't have
to take it anymore.

1057
01:32:37.511 --> 01:32:39.503
She doesn't.
She can come with me now.

1058
01:32:39.714 --> 01:32:40.703
I don't see it coming.

1059
01:32:40.948 --> 01:32:44.315
He hits my head with a two-by-four
and I'm bleeding from my ear.

1060
01:32:44.519 --> 01:32:48.285
He's dragging me behind the house into
the garage. Then he's gone.

1061
01:32:48.489 --> 01:32:50.457
A minute, five minutes, I don't know.

1062
01:32:50.658 --> 01:32:54.618
Then he's back and wetting me down.
And I don't understand.

1063
01:32:54.830 --> 01:32:59.767
I don't understand why water
should smell so bad.

1064
01:33:00.469 --> 01:33:03.632
I don't understand. And then I see it.

1065
01:33:05.239 --> 01:33:06.729
I see...

1066
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:10.671
...this...

1067
01:33:13.649 --> 01:33:15.412
...this gas can.

1068
01:33:16.718 --> 01:33:19.983
This red gas can from his truck.

1069
01:33:25.695 --> 01:33:28.562
And he Looks at me one Last time...

1070
01:33:30.533 --> 01:33:32.432
...and he Lights a match.

1071
01:33:36.839 --> 01:33:39.205
And the Last thing I remember...

1072
01:33:39.842 --> 01:33:41.606
...and I'll never forget it...

1073
01:33:41.845 --> 01:33:43.369
...were his eyes.

1074
01:33:45.448 --> 01:33:48.417
His eyes, because they were
filled with this...

1075
01:33:50.353 --> 01:33:52.082
...immense...

1076
01:33:53.289 --> 01:33:55.189
...satisfaction.

1077
01:33:59.095 --> 01:34:00.084
I'm so sorry.

1078
01:34:00.363 --> 01:34:04.026
Don't tell me how sorry you
are for me!

1079
01:34:04.968 --> 01:34:07.266
Tell me how you'll stop it
happening to Trevor.

1080
01:34:07.470 --> 01:34:09.802
Ricky would never do that.

1081
01:34:10.206 --> 01:34:13.267
Oh, Jesus, Arlene. He doesn't have to.

1082
01:34:15.546 --> 01:34:17.707
All he has to do is not Love him.

1083
01:35:35.061 --> 01:35:36.392
What's going on?

1084
01:35:36.595 --> 01:35:39.325
What's going on?
I'll tell you what's going on.

1085
01:35:39.565 --> 01:35:41.556
- What are you doing?
- What's it Look Like?

1086
01:35:41.767 --> 01:35:42.631
You can't do this.

1087
01:35:42.835 --> 01:35:45.633
What are you putting in my room?
We had an agreement.

1088
01:35:46.974 --> 01:35:48.497
My son won't talk to me.

1089
01:35:48.708 --> 01:35:51.575
He won't Look at me!
You turn him against me?

1090
01:35:51.811 --> 01:35:54.712
I told you I wasn't gonna make him
talk to you.

1091
01:35:55.414 --> 01:35:56.574
You could get a job.

1092
01:35:56.816 --> 01:35:59.649
- What am I supposed to use for a car?
- Take the bus.

1093
01:35:59.852 --> 01:36:01.319
That'll be the day.

1094
01:36:01.989 --> 01:36:04.423
- You can't stay in this room.
- This is our room.

1095
01:36:04.624 --> 01:36:06.421
This is our house, our bed.

1096
01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:08.560
- You've been drinking.
- Kiss me.

1097
01:36:09.363 --> 01:36:13.322
Stop it! Stop it!
I want you out of this house.

1098
01:36:15.535 --> 01:36:18.095
- What's your problem?
- I want you out.

1099
01:36:20.874 --> 01:36:23.434
Turn that down!
I'll come and pound your ass!

1100
01:36:23.643 --> 01:36:26.544
- Don't talk to him Like that!
- Don't tell me how to talk!

1101
01:36:26.747 --> 01:36:29.443
Don't tell me how to talk to anybody.
I've had enough.

1102
01:36:29.649 --> 01:36:33.051
- Are you getting mad?
- What are you gonna do about it?

1103
01:36:33.821 --> 01:36:36.881
I Liked you better when you had
a few drinks in you.

1104
01:36:38.292 --> 01:36:40.522
You want me out of the house, I'm out!

1105
01:36:40.728 --> 01:36:42.059
Sorry.

1106
01:36:47.734 --> 01:36:49.862
I think I made a mistake.

1107
01:36:55.376 --> 01:36:57.606
Everybody makes mistakes.

1108
01:37:58.842 --> 01:38:00.207
All right, bring them up.

1109
01:38:00.443 --> 01:38:02.775
Thank you. Carefully.

1110
01:38:02.979 --> 01:38:04.446
Thank you.

1111
01:38:05.114 --> 01:38:07.379
Careful. Did you get rid
of your hiccups?

1112
01:38:07.884 --> 01:38:10.444
Told you holding your breath
would work.

1113
01:38:10.887 --> 01:38:13.788
Thank you. Careful. Thank you.

1114
01:38:16.626 --> 01:38:18.025
Very nice.

1115
01:38:18.528 --> 01:38:21.190
Give me that one. Thank you.

1116
01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:26.231
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1117
01:38:34.277 --> 01:38:35.744
Trevor, what is it?

1118
01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:39.315
Are you still gonna pay it forward?

1119
01:38:44.255 --> 01:38:46.223
You could say you don't have to...

1120
01:38:48.192 --> 01:38:49.921
...because it didn't work out.

1121
01:38:51.562 --> 01:38:53.463
But I thought you still might.

1122
01:39:00.304 --> 01:39:04.263
Trevor, I would Like more than
anything to do that for you.

1123
01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:09.574
- When I find something worthy--
- I know somebody who needs something.

1124
01:39:10.749 --> 01:39:14.014
- You have to Let me find this--
- You know who it is.

1125
01:39:16.655 --> 01:39:17.747
Look...

1126
01:39:18.924 --> 01:39:22.416
...you don't understand everything.
All right?

1127
01:39:22.627 --> 01:39:24.960
So you do not know what you're asking.

1128
01:39:25.164 --> 01:39:27.427
Give her another chance.

1129
01:39:30.835 --> 01:39:33.963
I will pay it forward.
I promise you that.

1130
01:39:35.607 --> 01:39:37.541
But I cannot do that.

1131
01:39:51.457 --> 01:39:53.721
But that's why this is the one.

1132
01:39:55.293 --> 01:39:57.956
Because it's supposed to be
something hard.

1133
01:40:01.534 --> 01:40:05.368
If you help my mom, even if you're
still mad, in a way nobody could--

1134
01:40:05.571 --> 01:40:09.029
- Did she ask you to talk to me?
- No, she thinks you won't forgive her.

1135
01:40:09.242 --> 01:40:11.176
But I still think you could.

1136
01:40:13.714 --> 01:40:16.205
If you wanted to do something huge...

1137
01:40:19.987 --> 01:40:21.453
...for someone...

1138
01:40:22.989 --> 01:40:24.581
...for my project.

1139
01:40:29.162 --> 01:40:30.527
For me.

1140
01:40:37.037 --> 01:40:38.265
She made her choice.

1141
01:40:38.472 --> 01:40:39.996
She said she made a mistake.

1142
01:40:40.207 --> 01:40:42.368
Well, that's the beauty of hindsight.

1143
01:41:00.328 --> 01:41:01.659
You don't care.

1144
01:41:04.198 --> 01:41:05.756
Yes, I do.

1145
01:41:06.934 --> 01:41:11.132
I will always care about you, always.

1146
01:41:14.576 --> 01:41:15.838
Yeah.

1147
01:41:17.378 --> 01:41:18.970
You're my teacher.

1148
01:41:20.114 --> 01:41:21.843
They pay you to.

1149
01:42:10.166 --> 01:42:12.633
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1150
01:42:16.806 --> 01:42:19.331
I ain't saying a thing till I
get one more.

1151
01:42:19.542 --> 01:42:23.137
You know, I thought you might
feel that way.

1152
01:42:27.851 --> 01:42:29.648
No, no. Later.

1153
01:42:38.695 --> 01:42:40.663
I got my places.

1154
01:42:41.364 --> 01:42:46.301
Places where nobody cares where
you park overnight.

1155
01:42:48.739 --> 01:42:50.969
Places where I live.

1156
01:42:52.343 --> 01:42:54.334
Anybody who knows me...

1157
01:42:54.545 --> 01:42:57.514
...knows where to find me.

1158
01:43:10.161 --> 01:43:11.389
Hi, Mom.

1159
01:43:13.864 --> 01:43:17.391
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you.

1160
01:43:19.438 --> 01:43:24.171
- After three years, why now?
- I can't watch you do this.

1161
01:43:27.979 --> 01:43:29.276
I drive by your house.

1162
01:43:29.481 --> 01:43:30.880
I know.

1163
01:43:32.883 --> 01:43:34.977
- He's big.
- Yeah.

1164
01:43:38.123 --> 01:43:39.784
What are you doing here?

1165
01:43:41.226 --> 01:43:43.854
Are you gonna try to put me
somewhere?

1166
01:43:44.062 --> 01:43:45.359
No.

1167
01:43:46.398 --> 01:43:48.127
Then what do you want?

1168
01:43:49.234 --> 01:43:52.636
I want to try to do something.

1169
01:43:56.976 --> 01:43:58.807
All the things...

1170
01:44:00.011 --> 01:44:01.842
...when I was a kid.

1171
01:44:03.682 --> 01:44:06.311
The booze...

1172
01:44:07.253 --> 01:44:08.811
...and the men.

1173
01:44:11.157 --> 01:44:13.648
What happened to me when you
weren't Looking.

1174
01:44:17.930 --> 01:44:19.898
I know we're all weak.

1175
01:44:20.666 --> 01:44:24.660
- No, not you.
- No, I've been weak.

1176
01:44:28.574 --> 01:44:30.041
Here's the thing.

1177
01:44:34.547 --> 01:44:36.242
I forgive you.

1178
01:45:12.053 --> 01:45:15.250
- I don't Like your hair.
- I know. I'm not putting it back.

1179
01:45:20.128 --> 01:45:24.121
So I'd Like to see you sometimes.
Is that okay?

1180
01:45:26.901 --> 01:45:28.163
Yes.

1181
01:45:30.071 --> 01:45:31.197
You can't Live with me.

1182
01:45:34.909 --> 01:45:36.570
Who would want to?

1183
01:45:39.113 --> 01:45:40.479
Can I see him?

1184
01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:43.217
Not drunk.

1185
01:45:43.419 --> 01:45:45.887
You've got to be sober if just
for two hours.

1186
01:45:46.088 --> 01:45:47.919
Yeah, I can do that.

1187
01:45:48.257 --> 01:45:49.518
Okay.

1188
01:45:53.328 --> 01:45:55.092
Then I'll come and find you.

1189
01:45:55.297 --> 01:45:56.491
Okay?

1190
01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:58.862
Yeah.

1191
01:46:00.002 --> 01:46:01.128
Okay.

1192
01:46:02.037 --> 01:46:04.164
Why'd you do this, Arley?

1193
01:46:10.279 --> 01:46:11.941
She told me why.

1194
01:46:13.883 --> 01:46:17.374
She told me I had to do
something big...

1195
01:46:18.687 --> 01:46:20.018
...for three other people.

1196
01:46:20.222 --> 01:46:23.714
Happy birthday dear Trevor

1197
01:46:24.059 --> 01:46:27.962
Happy birthday to you

1198
01:46:28.164 --> 01:46:30.962
And many more

1199
01:46:43.381 --> 01:46:45.314
What'd you wish for?

1200
01:46:45.515 --> 01:46:47.983
He can't tell you or it
won't come true.

1201
01:46:48.184 --> 01:46:49.344
Can I have some napkins?

1202
01:46:49.552 --> 01:46:50.541
Here you go.

1203
01:46:56.393 --> 01:46:57.520
I'll get it.

1204
01:47:03.734 --> 01:47:04.894
Mom?

1205
01:47:07.104 --> 01:47:11.199
I'm Chris Chandler. I'm a reporter.
Could I have a moment of your time?

1206
01:47:11.408 --> 01:47:14.310
Why? I don't have anything to
say about anything.

1207
01:47:14.545 --> 01:47:18.948
Please. I've already spoken to your
mother, which naturally led me to you.

1208
01:47:19.150 --> 01:47:21.710
- My mother?
- She told me about pay it forward.

1209
01:47:21.919 --> 01:47:24.114
How you helped her.
I'm doing a story.

1210
01:47:24.321 --> 01:47:25.948
You can't. That's private.

1211
01:47:26.657 --> 01:47:30.492
It upset my son. It was a social
studies thing and it didn't work.

1212
01:47:30.729 --> 01:47:32.253
Social studies?

1213
01:47:32.464 --> 01:47:35.456
Leave it alone. He just wants
to get on with seventh grade.

1214
01:47:35.667 --> 01:47:37.897
It's his birthday and it's a bad time.

1215
01:47:38.103 --> 01:47:40.502
- I'm sorry--
- No, I'm sorry.

1216
01:47:40.738 --> 01:47:43.468
I've been tracking this story
from Los Angeles.

1217
01:47:43.674 --> 01:47:46.041
Pay it Forward, the movement,
reached L.A.

1218
01:47:46.244 --> 01:47:48.474
- Come on. The movement?
- Yeah.

1219
01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:51.615
Your son had something to do
with this?

1220
01:48:04.030 --> 01:48:05.894
I really appreciate this,
Mrs. McKinney.

1221
01:48:06.098 --> 01:48:07.395
It's up to him.

1222
01:48:08.967 --> 01:48:11.527
- Ready, slugger?
- I guess.

1223
01:48:11.770 --> 01:48:13.567
Here you go. Up here, please.

1224
01:48:13.772 --> 01:48:15.741
Just Like you're getting a haircut.

1225
01:48:16.476 --> 01:48:18.808
- You been interviewed before?
- No.

1226
01:48:21.714 --> 01:48:23.045
This is for you.

1227
01:48:23.249 --> 01:48:24.238
Hi. How are you?

1228
01:48:24.450 --> 01:48:27.942
- What's your name?
- Chris Chandler. Nice to meet you.

1229
01:48:28.154 --> 01:48:31.488
Less painful than the dentist.
Just be yourself, okay?

1230
01:48:31.725 --> 01:48:33.385
- Ready to go?
- I guess.

1231
01:48:33.593 --> 01:48:36.255
Come on, you got to have
some gusto here.

1232
01:48:36.462 --> 01:48:38.794
All right, Let's go.
All right, great.

1233
01:48:39.232 --> 01:48:42.929
Just be yourself. Relax.
It's gonna be a Lot of fun.

1234
01:48:49.176 --> 01:48:50.768
Okay, we're on?

1235
01:48:52.346 --> 01:48:56.976
Hi, I'm Chris Chandler and I'm joined
today by an unusual seventh grader...

1236
01:48:57.184 --> 01:48:58.742
...Trevor McKinney.

1237
01:48:59.253 --> 01:49:01.243
Trevor, you must be pretty proud of
yourself.

1238
01:49:01.454 --> 01:49:02.581
No.

1239
01:49:04.258 --> 01:49:05.953
So you're not proud at all?

1240
01:49:07.761 --> 01:49:09.752
I don't know. I guess.

1241
01:49:09.963 --> 01:49:14.195
Come on, you start a movement Like Pay
it Forward. You're not proud?

1242
01:49:14.802 --> 01:49:19.206
I guess. I mean, I got an "A"
in social studies.

1243
01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:21.965
But that was just for the effort.

1244
01:49:22.343 --> 01:49:24.208
Stuff I did, it didn't work out.

1245
01:49:25.446 --> 01:49:27.845
- You're here.
- Yeah, but--

1246
01:49:28.549 --> 01:49:31.017
I don't know. I tried real hard...

1247
01:49:32.052 --> 01:49:33.680
...but nothing really happened.

1248
01:49:34.522 --> 01:49:36.285
My mom's stuff worked.

1249
01:49:36.491 --> 01:49:39.619
She talked to my grandma.
Kind of made up with her.

1250
01:49:39.994 --> 01:49:41.791
It was really hard for her.

1251
01:49:42.363 --> 01:49:46.060
It was great for me, because my
grandma came to my birthday party.

1252
01:49:48.069 --> 01:49:49.697
And I had really missed her.

1253
01:49:52.074 --> 01:49:54.736
And that's why Pay it Forward went to
all those places...

1254
01:49:55.410 --> 01:49:56.604
...because of my mom.

1255
01:49:57.745 --> 01:50:00.305
Because she was so brave.

1256
01:50:00.915 --> 01:50:06.252
My stuff, I don't know. I think some
people are too scared or something...

1257
01:50:06.689 --> 01:50:08.919
...to think things can be different.

1258
01:50:13.362 --> 01:50:15.227
The world's not exactly...

1259
01:50:16.632 --> 01:50:17.621
...shit.

1260
01:50:20.704 --> 01:50:25.663
I guess it's hard for some people who
are used to things the way they are...

1261
01:50:25.875 --> 01:50:27.502
...even if they're bad...

1262
01:50:28.878 --> 01:50:30.277
...to change.

1263
01:50:32.081 --> 01:50:33.776
And they kind of give up.

1264
01:50:38.788 --> 01:50:40.881
When they do, everybody--

1265
01:50:42.859 --> 01:50:44.383
They kind of Lose.

1266
01:51:12.290 --> 01:51:13.450
Hi, Arlene.

1267
01:51:16.594 --> 01:51:19.756
I don't want to be one of those people
he's talking about.

1268
01:51:20.497 --> 01:51:22.226
And I've become one.

1269
01:51:25.069 --> 01:51:27.765
I don't want to spend another
second of wasted air.

1270
01:51:31.409 --> 01:51:34.071
Please don't Let me stay trapped
in here forever.

1271
01:51:34.278 --> 01:51:35.506
I won't.

1272
01:51:35.713 --> 01:51:38.410
I don't want to spend another second
without you.

1273
01:51:51.729 --> 01:51:52.718
See you around.

1274
01:51:52.930 --> 01:51:54.694
All right, see you Later, guys.

1275
01:51:58.136 --> 01:51:59.125
Let me go!

1276
01:51:59.338 --> 01:52:00.965
- Stop it!
- Who'd you tell?

1277
01:52:02.441 --> 01:52:05.467
- Who'd you tell, tattletale?
- I didn't tell anybody.

1278
01:52:08.814 --> 01:52:10.510
I didn't say anything.

1279
01:52:10.717 --> 01:52:11.774
Help!

1280
01:52:15.988 --> 01:52:18.479
Stop it! Trevor!

1281
01:52:23.228 --> 01:52:24.422
Come here.

1282
01:52:28.501 --> 01:52:29.490
Let me go!

1283
01:52:29.936 --> 01:52:31.767
Cut it out! No!

1284
01:52:34.374 --> 01:52:35.602
Get out of my face!

1285
01:52:35.808 --> 01:52:37.400
Punch him! Come on!

1286
01:52:38.011 --> 01:52:38.977
No!

1287
01:52:40.278 --> 01:52:41.211
Leave him alone!

1288
01:53:03.570 --> 01:53:05.504
Someone get an ambulance!

1289
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:03.491
I guess it's hard for
some people who...

1290
01:54:03.698 --> 01:54:06.166
...are used to things
the way they are.

1291
01:54:06.367 --> 01:54:08.232
...even if they're bad...

1292
01:54:08.436 --> 01:54:09.698
...to change.

1293
01:54:13.208 --> 01:54:14.870
I guess they kind of give up...

1294
01:54:17.213 --> 01:54:18.680
...and when they do...

1295
01:54:20.049 --> 01:54:23.541
...everybody kind of loses.

1296
01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:27.253
These moments make you sorry
to report anything.

1297
01:54:27.456 --> 01:54:30.914
This remarkable young man died
at 7: 35 this evening.

1298
01:54:31.127 --> 01:54:35.962
There are now confirmed incidents of
Pay it Forward in L.A., San Francisco.

1299
01:54:36.198 --> 01:54:37.722
In Phoenix, we're checking...

1300
01:54:37.933 --> 01:54:40.766
...if the 16 foster children who
received computers...

1301
01:54:40.970 --> 01:54:43.461
...is connected to this movement.

1302
01:54:43.706 --> 01:54:44.968
It's hard.

1303
01:54:45.207 --> 01:54:46.732
You can't plan it.

1304
01:54:48.044 --> 01:54:51.070
You have to watch people more.

1305
01:54:52.983 --> 01:54:56.418
Sort of keep an eye on them
to protect them...

1306
01:54:58.754 --> 01:55:01.245
...because they can't always
see what they need.

1307
01:55:04.427 --> 01:55:08.659
It's like your big chance to fix
something that's not like your bike.

1308
01:55:16.673 --> 01:55:18.767
You can fix a person.

1309
01:55:18.976 --> 01:55:22.468
Is that what you want for your
birthday, everybody to pay it forward?

1310
01:55:22.846 --> 01:55:23.938
I can't ask for that.

1311
01:55:24.147 --> 01:55:27.583
- Sure you can. Why not?
- Wouldn't work.

1312
01:55:27.784 --> 01:55:29.081
Why?

1313
01:55:36.494 --> 01:55:38.689
I already blew out my candles.
