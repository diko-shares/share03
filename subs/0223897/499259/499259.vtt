1
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.010
Get back!

2
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.110
I'll kill her!

3
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.120
Oh, my god!

4
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.920
3-I-90. I repeat 3-l-90.

5
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.460
Request you notify
hostage negotiation team.

6
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.730
Have them respond...

7
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.990
Officer: Petersen!

8
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.300
Suspect: Get your boys
out of here.

9
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.450
Officer: Suspect, male,
caucasian, approximate...

10
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.210
I'm a reporter.
I'm with the press,

11
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.210
How long have
you guys been here?

12
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.210
Get out of here!

13
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.350
Is this domestic or drugs?

14
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.350
Is that his girlfriend.

15
00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.370
Or what? Get out of here!

16
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.350
Who is it?

17
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.350
Come on, talk to me.

18
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.310
Masius, please get him.

19
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.290
Out of here. Walk!

20
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.830
Come on.
I got my passes, masius.

21
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:05.830
Shit!

22
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.830
Hey! I got every right.

23
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.900
To be here. Where'd he go?

24
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.240
Officer: Suspect has withdrawn.

25
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.660
Into the interior of the room.

26
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.850
We no longer
have visual contact.

27
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.130
Aah!

28
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.150
No!

29
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.420
That was my... Car.

30
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.890
That was...

31
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.620
Ohh!

32
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.590
Ooh.

33
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.300
Aw.

34
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.320
Having a little car trouble?

35
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.460
That's a keen observation.

36
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.980
I can help you.

37
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.020
It's the jag.

38
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.550
You want me to drive home.

39
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.770
In your car?

40
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.730
No. I want you to take my car.

41
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.320
Had a lot of luck lately.
I don't need it.

42
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.960
You're giving me
a brand-new jaguar,

43
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.330
And you don't want anything?

44
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.980
Well, I can prove it.
Give me your card.

45
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.520
I'll be in touch.

46
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.940
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is this?

47
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.990
What... what? Do you want me.

48
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.260
To kill your wife or something?

49
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.080
No. Tempting, but, no.

50
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.540
Call it generosity
between 2 strangers.

51
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.630
Generosity? Hey, fella,
it's a jaguar.

52
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.730
You expect me to drive off.

53
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.390
In a brand-new jaguar,
and that's it?

54
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.420
That's right.

55
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.870
Hey! You're a freak.
You know that?

56
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.210
You are a freak.

57
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.760
You want me to get in this car?

58
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.100
No way. It's probably
going to blow up.

59
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.190
Yeah. That's real funny.

60
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:20.720
Bits and pieces of me
raining down.

61
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.720
In the street.

62
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.710
Ha ha. You think

63
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.680
I'm going near
that thing? You're nuts!

64
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.620
Besides, I've got a car.

65
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.500
Sort of.

66
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.070
What? You like it?

67
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.320
Cool blade, huh?

68
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.720
Want to see your guts...

69
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.380
Keep it in your pants.

70
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.400
Fag.

71
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.400
He's going to kill you.

72
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.960
I got pepper spray.

73
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.630
Apparently none of you
have ever seen.

74
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.790
A new teacher before.

75
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.980
I'm mr. Simonet.

76
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.570
Welcome to the seventh
grade, middle school...

77
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.990
That hellish, shaky bridge.

78
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.210
You all must cross
before you become.

79
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.800
Members of
that undyingly enviable.

80
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.300
High-school elite.

81
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.140
Now, some of you might
think you can't get.

82
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.620
Across this bridge fast enough,

83
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.090
That you'd rather
hold your breath,

84
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.630
Close your eyes, and not think.

85
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.150
About anything
until it's all over.

86
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.370
Well, I'm here to tell you.

87
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.330
That that is not
an option in this class.

88
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.580
Lateness...

89
00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.840
Busted.

90
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.590
Tardiness...

91
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.850
To be late for your first class.

92
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.400
On your first day of school,

93
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.550
What does that indicate?

94
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.090
I'm having a bad hair day.

95
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.010
Perhaps what it indicates.

96
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.820
Is a lack of respect.

97
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.250
You see, I'm going
to be here every day.

98
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.420
For you.

99
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.210
And so, I expect you
to be here for me.

100
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.470
On time. No excuses.

101
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.670
Put that down.

102
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.420
Wait.

103
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.100
Now...

104
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:42.030
This class is social studies.

105
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.950
That is you and the world.

106
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.750
Yes, there is a world out there,

107
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.010
And even if you decide
you don't want.

108
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.090
To meet it, it's still.

109
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.970
Going to hit you
right in the face.

110
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.940
Believe me.

111
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.610
So, best you start
thinking about.

112
00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.610
The world now.

113
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.730
And what it means to you.

114
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.310
What does the world mean to you?

115
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.330
Come on! A little class
participation here.

116
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.380
Is it just this class
you want to get out of?

117
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.000
Your house? Your street?

118
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:17.180
Any further any of you
want to go than that?

119
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.180
Yes.

120
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.020
The mall. That's only,

121
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.540
Like, 2 miles away from me.

122
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.160
Well, let me ask you
another question.

123
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.860
How often do you
think about things.

124
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.920
That happen outside
of this town?

125
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.360
You watch the news? Yes?

126
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:33.690
No?

127
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.500
All right. So we're
not global thinkers yet,

128
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.850
But why aren't we?

129
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.040
'Cause we're 11.

130
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.200
Good point. What's your name?

131
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.580
Trevor.

132
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.700
Maybe trevor's absolutely right.

133
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.210
Why should we think
about the world?

134
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.870
I mean, after all,
what does the world.

135
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:51.880
Expect of us?

136
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.630
Expect?

137
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:55.380
Mm-mmm. Of you.

138
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.040
Mr. Simonet: What does
the world expect of you?

139
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.980
Nothing.

140
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.200
Nothing.

141
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.540
My god, boys and girls,
he's absolutely right.

142
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.540
Nothing.

143
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.510
I mean, here you are.
You can't drive.

144
00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.380
You can't vote. You can't
even go to the bathroom.

145
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.020
Without a pass from me.
You're stuck!

146
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.000
Right here,
in the seventh grade.

147
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.410
But not forever.

148
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.290
Because one day, you'll be free.

149
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.320
All right. But what if
on that day you're free,

150
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:37.280
You haven't prepared,
you're not ready,

151
00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.600
And then you look around you.

152
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:42.220
And you don't like
what the world is?

153
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.030
What if the world...

154
00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:48.120
Is just a big disappointment?

155
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.790
We're screwed.

156
00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:51.710
Unless...

157
00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:55.630
Unless you take the things
that you don't like.

158
00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.090
About this world and
you flip them upside down.

159
00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:01.090
Right on their ass...
don't tell your parents

160
00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.100
I used that word...
and you can start that...

161
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:06.630
Today!

162
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.030
This is your assignment.

163
00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:12.950
Extra credit.

164
00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:16.840
It goes on all year long.

165
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:19.660
Now, wait a minute. What?

166
00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.000
What? What's wrong with this?

167
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.000
What's the matter?

168
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.000
Yes?

169
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:25.040
It's... it's, like, so...

170
00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.150
So what? There must
be a word to finish.

171
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.600
That sentence.
Someone help her?

172
00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:30.600
Weird. Weird.

173
00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.580
Crazy. Crazy.

174
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:32.590
Hard.

175
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:33.590
Bummer.

176
00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.950
Bummer. Hard.

177
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:41.260
How about possible?

178
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.020
It's possible.

179
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.370
The realm of possibility.

180
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.960
Exists where.

181
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.320
In each of you?

182
00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.220
Here.

183
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.530
So you can do it.

184
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:04.230
You can surprise us.

185
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.950
It's up to you.

186
00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.060
Or you can just sit back.

187
00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.660
And let it atrophy.

188
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.230
Atrophy.

189
00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.990
If there is a word you hear.

190
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.290
That you don't understand,

191
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:18.790
There's a dictionary
at the front of the room.

192
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.710
Look it up.

193
00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.420
And there are
these dictionaries,

194
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.840
Which you will carry
with you at all times,

195
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.640
Because in this class,
we're going to learn.

196
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.430
To love words
and their meanings.

197
00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.020
Any questions?

198
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.990
Trevor: Yeah.

199
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.520
So you'll, like, flunk us.

200
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.690
If we don't change.

201
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.700
The world?

202
00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.450
Well, no. I wouldn't do that.

203
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:43.310
But you might just
squeak by with a "c."

204
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:50.250
What'd you ever do
to change the world?

205
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.050
Students: Whoa!

206
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.530
Well, trevor, I get
a good night's sleep,

207
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.700
I eat a hearty breakfast,

208
00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:02.880
I show up on time,

209
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.570
And then I pass the buck to you.

210
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.060
Now, I want you all
to write your names.

211
00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:14.700
In these books,
and... what's your name?

212
00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.370
Molly? All right.

213
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.150
I want molly to look up
the word "atrophy."

214
00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.700
No, we're not coming
down to milwaukee.

215
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.710
No. You went straight to hell.

216
00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:38.630
Straight to hell.

217
00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.010
Ok. 4 tequilas. Who's having.

218
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.300
The fourth one? You are.

219
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.300
Oh, no, no.

220
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.300
Not for me. Thank you.

221
00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:44.330
You cannot get in trouble.

222
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:45.300
We bought it for you.

223
00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:46.310
I thank you so much.

224
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:47.360
No, thank you.

225
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.310
Oh, come on. Why not?

226
00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:49.370
Because I promised my kid.

227
00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:50.360
Men: Ohhh.

228
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:51.570
I know. It's horrible!

229
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:52.850
You guys have fun!

230
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.440
Wait, wait. Here. Here.

231
00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.940
Thank you. Ohh! Uh-oh.

232
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.310
What are you doing, junior?

233
00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.810
What is junior gonna do?

234
00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.950
Uh-oh. What are
you doing, junior?!

235
00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:01.310
What are you doing?!

236
00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.500
What time do you get off?

237
00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.620
If only I weren't married!

238
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:11.980
Oh, no. Aww. She's married.

239
00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.180
She's married.

240
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.540
I'm single! I'm single! Whoo!

241
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.470
Hello.

242
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.590
Woman: Hey!

243
00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.180
Hey.

244
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.500
How'd it go?

245
00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.520
Are you there?

246
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.520
Yeah.

247
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:45.520
How'd it go?

248
00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.190
What?

249
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:48.180
How'd it go?

250
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.350
How was your first day?

251
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:50.400
Ok.

252
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.100
Trev, come on,
you got to speak up.

253
00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.320
I can't hear you, ok?

254
00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.350
Ok.

255
00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.220
Sorry I wasn't home.
I had a chance.

256
00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.340
To pick up another shift,

257
00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:00.520
So you know I didn't
have a choice.

258
00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.120
You mad at me?

259
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.110
So, trev, what're you doing?

260
00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.950
Nothing.

261
00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.060
You find the spaghetti?

262
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.110
I'm eating it.

263
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.500
Mom: Good.

264
00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.870
Come on, honey, tell
me what happened.

265
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:19.890
I got to go.

266
00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:31.940
A spoon?

267
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.250
Spoon?

268
00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:56.820
Mom.

269
00:21:58.530 --> 00:21:59.760
Mom!

270
00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.640
Mom! Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

271
00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:05.820
My friend's coming in
to take a shower, ok?

272
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:06.840
Ok.

273
00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.280
That's not really breakfast.

274
00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.370
You don't eat breakfast.

275
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.740
Well, let's have some. Come on.

276
00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.650
I'll make some eggs.
I'll have some, too.

277
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.250
You sure you won't throw up?

278
00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.590
What is that supposed to mean?

279
00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:43.930
What do you think it means?

280
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:45.730
Why don't you tell me
what it means.

281
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.250
You're sneaking it.

282
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:48.750
I'm not sneaking anything.

283
00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.050
Ok!

284
00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.390
Trevor.

285
00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:52.880
Trevor, wait a minute.

286
00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:53.880
I'm sorry.

287
00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:54.880
You're right. Listen.

288
00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:55.920
Sit down for one minute.

289
00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:56.920
I want to talk to you.

290
00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:57.920
You wanna lie to me.

291
00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.090
No. I don't want to lie to you.

292
00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:00.060
I want you to sit
down for one minute.

293
00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.480
Hey! I want us to get along.

294
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.600
Aah! Sorry.

295
00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.600
It's ok, mom.

296
00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:04.600
Find the toilet paper.

297
00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.140
Who are you?

298
00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.140
You get out! Ok.

299
00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.140
Get out of my house!

300
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.130
Thanks a lot.

301
00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:10.330
Mom: I said what? Get out!

302
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:11.400
Man: No. I got it.

303
00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:13.500
You said he could come in.

304
00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.500
And take a shower.

305
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:15.640
I never said that!

306
00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.740
Yes, you did! You said...

307
00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.910
I said it's ok
to let a strange man.

308
00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:18.910
Into my bathroom?

309
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:20.080
He's my friend.

310
00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.750
What? You can't
have a friend like that.

311
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:22.750
It's for my assignment.

312
00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:24.090
What assignment?

313
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:25.340
You won't get it.

314
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.760
Mr. Simonet will get it.

315
00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.810
Who's mr. Simonet?

316
00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.910
Hey! I'm talking to you.

317
00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.890
He's my teacher!

318
00:23:58.890 --> 00:23:59.990
Mr. Simonet?

319
00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:03.900
Yes. I'm eugene... Uh, simonet.

320
00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:07.670
Hello.

321
00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:10.340
Hello.

322
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:12.900
What is this assignment?

323
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.020
'Scuse me?

324
00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.070
What did you tell
my son to make him.

325
00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:16.710
Bring a homeless man
into my house?

326
00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.750
Uh, I have 2 problems.

327
00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:23.700
One, I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

328
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:25.040
And 2, I don't know who you are.

329
00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.710
Arlene mckinney. My boy is.

330
00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:29.050
In your social studies
class? Trevor.

331
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.880
Trevor.

332
00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:32.890
Yes, he's very attentive.

333
00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:34.560
He's very exigent,

334
00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.720
Which I like.

335
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.580
Exigent.

336
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.560
It's challenging, testing...

337
00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:39.570
I know what it means.

338
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:40.650
Would you like to tell me why.

339
00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.120
My kid brought a bum
into my house.

340
00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.620
I have no idea. Bullshit!

341
00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:45.040
Mrs. Mckinney, I don't know.

342
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:46.410
How your son interpreted
the assignment.

343
00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.910
How do you think
he interpreted it?

344
00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.000
Well, I don't know.

345
00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:52.220
My suggestion to you is
if you want to know,

346
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:53.760
Why don't you go home
and talk to your son.

347
00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:55.130
Hey! I talked to him.

348
00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:56.800
Really? Then why did you come.

349
00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.220
All the way down here to ask me.

350
00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.110
What the assignment is?

351
00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:03.670
It's not a state secret.

352
00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.760
Yeah! And?

353
00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:12.010
It's an assignment I give out.

354
00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.760
At the beginning
of every year to inspire.

355
00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:14.930
I don't expect them.

356
00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.490
To actually change
the world, the whole...

357
00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:17.820
You expect them to change the...

358
00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:19.490
Excuse me.
It's to get them to think,

359
00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.360
Not walk on water.
It's a very good assignment.

360
00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:22.360
You give them an assignment.

361
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:23.370
You don't think they can do.

362
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:24.670
What kind of teacher are you?

363
00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:26.790
I didn't say that.
You know, they make attempts.

364
00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:28.430
Every now and then, they
clean up a little graffiti.

365
00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:29.500
Before they lose interest.

366
00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.500
Hey! This is my kid!

367
00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:31.750
You don't know him.

368
00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:34.100
You tell him
he can do something,

369
00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:35.410
He's going to believe you.

370
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:36.410
And when he can't,

371
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:37.930
It's going to wipe him out.

372
00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:39.150
They ought to fire your ass.

373
00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:40.980
Out of here right now!

374
00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:44.010
Well, you know,
they probably won't do that,

375
00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:46.140
Because I fill
a very excellent quota.

376
00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:49.150
I'm just this side
of parking in the blue zone.

377
00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:50.250
Oh, so you think.

378
00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.390
You can do whatever you want.

379
00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:52.910
Just 'cause
your face is messed up?

380
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.520
Mrs. Mckinney, why don't you
put down in writing.

381
00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.900
Your little and loud complaints,
and I'll make sure.

382
00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:01.800
They get put
in the suggestion box.

383
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.400
Jesus.

384
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:09.660
You are really somethin'.

385
00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.890
Thanks. I appreciate
the euphemism.

386
00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.170
I've always wanted
to be somethin'.

387
00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.150
Man: Can I help you
with something, miss?

388
00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:26.960
Oh. Uh, no.

389
00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:38.800
Mr. Thorsen! Hey!

390
00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.050
Hey, hold up, man. Come on,

391
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:41.680
I've been waiting
all day for you.

392
00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:43.890
Hey. Hey, why won't
you return my calls?

393
00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:45.110
We're not friends.

394
00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:46.560
You know, I got
the pink slip for the car,

395
00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.030
And that's quite
a stocking stuffer.

396
00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:49.480
Are you gonna tell me
you can't accept it?

397
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:50.980
No, no. That would
make me a moron.

398
00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:52.070
I just want to know about these,

399
00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:53.460
Uh, these instructions
you left me.

400
00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.410
Just do what they say.
Pay it forward.

401
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:56.460
Why?

402
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.410
Because you've accepted the car.

403
00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.420
You're obligated.

404
00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.670
I'm obligated.

405
00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:00.890
Well, what if I don't
feel obligated, huh?

406
00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:02.140
Well, what if I
just take my new car.

407
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.160
And get a couple hookers.

408
00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:04.180
And drive down to mexico?

409
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.180
I'll never know.

410
00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.510
But you'll what... what is this?

411
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.570
Come on, for real.

412
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:09.350
An attack of total altruism.

413
00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:10.410
From a litigator.

414
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:11.660
I've got a meeting.

415
00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.030
I've got a story, ok?

416
00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:15.680
A senior partner
at channing and moss.

417
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:17.020
Is giving away new cars?

418
00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.610
You could tell me a reason,
or I could make one up.

419
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:20.520
Mine will be a lot more
interesting, I promise.

420
00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:22.010
You've gone dotty.
You're wearing crystals.

421
00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:25.270
You're keeping a few
too many cats at home, huh?

422
00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:28.390
All right. Look, all right?
Listen. Listen, please.

423
00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:30.640
My ex-wife has
everything, ok? There.

424
00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:32.180
Plus she's
in a lesbian relationship,

425
00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.770
I think, just to piss me off.

426
00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:35.760
Help me out, please.

427
00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:44.870
My daughter has asthma.
One night, it was very bad,

428
00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.680
The worst I'd ever seen it.

429
00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.210
It was the middle of the night,

430
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.180
The emergency room.

431
00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:51.520
We were waiting forever.

432
00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.100
Couldn't get anyone
to pay attention.

433
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:04.830
Her inhaler doesn't
seem to be working at all.

434
00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.810
Sorry. Mr. Parker.
What happened?

435
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.700
My sister, she stabbed me.

436
00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:09.700
I can't believe...

437
00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:11.040
Excuse me. We were here first.

438
00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.370
I'm sorry, we have to go
with stab wounds first.

439
00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.880
She can't breathe.
She's very scared.

440
00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.010
Look, I will let you know.

441
00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.050
Mr. Thorsen:
Somebody has to see her.

442
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.970
Nurse: I'm sorry.
It's protocol.

443
00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:18.840
It's never been this bad.

444
00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:19.820
You have to do something.

445
00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:21.330
Sir, would you just sit down?

446
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.060
I'm sorry. We've
been here for 4 hours.

447
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:25.020
You need to get a doctor.

448
00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:28.010
No. No, wait. Hey, no. No!

449
00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:29.790
Would you excuse me? Excuse me.

450
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.290
That's bullshit. You need
to help her right now!

451
00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.410
Excuse me?

452
00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.330
No. No, why you give
me all this shit?

453
00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.400
Ain't you got some oxygen.

454
00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:35.340
Or something you can give her?

455
00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:36.670
Fine, let me... no, no, no.

456
00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.140
You don't need
to get no supervisor.

457
00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.840
You're the supervisor
of the day. Huh?

458
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:41.820
You are the supervisor today.

459
00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.330
You feel me on that?
Now, I want you to take.

460
00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.670
Your skinny ass down the hall,

461
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:46.720
Put the little girl
on a tray, and supervise her,

462
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.400
And I want you to get her
some goddamn air!

463
00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.000
I got your back, sis.

464
00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.500
Oh, bitch, you still here?!
Shit!

465
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:56.680
Oh, shit ain't funny,
now, is it?

466
00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.570
Come on, man! No! No, man!
This ain't fair, man!

467
00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:02.760
Come on! Come on, man!
There! There!

468
00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.220
Mr. Thorsen: I thanked him,

469
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.240
And there were some
very specific orifices.

470
00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:08.500
In which I was told
to shove my thanks.

471
00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.840
He told me,
"just pay it forward."

472
00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.810
3 big favors for 3 other people.

473
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:13.990
That's it.

474
00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:16.160
So, it's like
a "pass it on" thing, then.

475
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:17.630
Wait a minute.
You and this lowlife.

476
00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.000
Were in this chain
of do-gooders?

477
00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:20.840
Some kind of mother teresa
conga line?

478
00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:22.730
That's a little new agey
for you, isn't it?

479
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:23.850
Sort of tibetan?

480
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:25.480
What, are you in a cult?

481
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:27.650
If you mention my name,

482
00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.920
You'll be selling your kidneys.

483
00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:30.660
To pay for your lawsuit.

484
00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.280
Cult.

485
00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.280
Hey. The guy...

486
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.250
What was the guy's name?

487
00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:39.060
Sorry. I'm late
for my mass wedding.

488
00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:00.220
Hey!

489
00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.480
I know somebody's in here.

490
00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:10.820
Man: Oh.

491
00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.810
Arlene: I know you're there.

492
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:15.560
I want you to come out,

493
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:17.450
Or I will find you
and shoot you, I swear...

494
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:21.370
Please don't shoot.

495
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.740
Please.

496
00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:27.500
You stay right there.
If I see you move one...

497
00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:35.620
Please don't pick it up!

498
00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.090
Please don't. I'm not moving.

499
00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.050
Please.

500
00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.750
What are you doin' on my truck?

501
00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:50.010
Let me show you. I'm just...

502
00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.070
I'm just gonna
open the door, ok?

503
00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:07.980
See, it might be easier
for you to sell now...

504
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.280
Now that it works.

505
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:10.480
I didn't ask for your help.

506
00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:11.740
No.

507
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.220
You been living in my garage?

508
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:15.310
No. Not after tonight.

509
00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:18.030
Look, can I come around?
I just wanna...

510
00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.490
I got a handyman job
at the royal motel.

511
00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:21.510
They're giving me a room.

512
00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:22.910
You just stay right there.

513
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.100
Please, I... I don't like guns.

514
00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:29.340
What is going on
with you and my son?

515
00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.090
He wanted to help somebody,

516
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:32.930
Wanted to get somebody
back on their feet,

517
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.100
So he gave me a little money.

518
00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.480
He gave you money?

519
00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:37.940
Yes, ma'am.

520
00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.020
That's his savings.

521
00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:42.660
Uh, well,
it's clothes and shoes,

522
00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:45.080
And I got the job off it.

523
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:48.290
You think you can keep it?

524
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:49.590
Looks to me like
you got yourself.

525
00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:52.030
A little problem.

526
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:57.540
I can lick it.

527
00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:00.180
How's that supposed
to happen all of a sudden?

528
00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.820
You ever been on the street?

529
00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.110
My mom took us pretty close.

530
00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:09.650
Well, you can't know.

531
00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:12.650
Not until you're
looking at a dumpster.

532
00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.000
But when you climb
into that thing.

533
00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:15.540
For the first time,

534
00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:17.660
And you pull those
newspapers over you,

535
00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:21.670
That's when you know that
you've messed your life up.

536
00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:24.660
Somebody comes along
like your son.

537
00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.750
And gives me a leg up,

538
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:29.320
I'll take it.

539
00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:33.240
Even from a kid, I'll take it.

540
00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:36.080
I...

541
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:39.910
I can't mess up again,
or I'll be dead.

542
00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:43.410
Look, I appreciate what
you're trying to do,

543
00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.480
Paying back trevor...

544
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:45.980
I'm not allowed
to pay back trevor.

545
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:47.740
Then what is it you're doing?

546
00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.710
I'm paying it forward.

547
00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:55.090
I know you want me to go.

548
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:58.030
I'll go.

549
00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:02.430
What's paying it forward?

550
00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:04.800
That's me.

551
00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:09.050
That's me,
and that's 3 people...

552
00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.650
And I'm going to help them,

553
00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.960
But it has to be
something really big,

554
00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:21.590
Something they can't
do by themselves...

555
00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:24.340
So I do it for them.

556
00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:29.380
Then they do it
for 3 other people...

557
00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:31.890
That's 9...

558
00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:35.900
And I do 3 more.

559
00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:40.570
That's 27, so, I'm
not really good at math,

560
00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.910
But it gets big
really fast, you know?

561
00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:46.560
It's not gonna work.

562
00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:51.910
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

563
00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:53.530
A little articulation, please.

564
00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.620
Yes.

565
00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.750
I think it's a good idea.

566
00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.720
Shawn? It's stupid.

567
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:58.720
Eugene: Adam?

568
00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:59.840
It's the honor system.

569
00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:00.930
People blow off
the honor system.

570
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:01.850
So what?

571
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:03.180
Just 'cause you do.

572
00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:06.090
Eugene: Well, trevor,
the class seems to think.

573
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:09.310
That you've come up with
an overly utopian idea.

574
00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:11.350
Look that word up in a minute.

575
00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:15.590
Like a perfect world?

576
00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:17.680
Mm-hmm.

577
00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:21.520
So?

578
00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:26.760
So, what put this idea
in your head?

579
00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:31.120
'Cause...

580
00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:34.290
Everything sucks.

581
00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.860
He talked to you about this?

582
00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:41.620
We've had
our discussions. Yeah.

583
00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:43.380
But you don't
have to worry, though,

584
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.930
'cause I'll just...
I'll tell him.

585
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:46.580
We can't talk no more.

586
00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:49.390
No, um, don't do that.

587
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:53.570
Would you like a cup of coffee?

588
00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:57.870
Yes, ma'am.

589
00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:59.950
Ok.

590
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:11.730
Boy: I call the president,
like, to talk about pollution,

591
00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.570
But my mom said now they're
gonna put us on some list,

592
00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:16.640
So she hung up.

593
00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:19.530
For this assignment,
I put up recycling flyers.

594
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:21.070
At 2 supermarkets.

595
00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:23.240
I'm gonna put up
this website in chinese.

596
00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.960
That's gonna tell
all the kids in china.

597
00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:26.600
To jump up and down
at the same time.

598
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:36.330
The goal being to knock
the earth off its axis.

599
00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:37.330
Yeah.

600
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:38.430
Thank you. Sit down, shawn.

601
00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:43.240
Well, your ideas
are as surprising.

602
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:44.800
As they are variegated.

603
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:46.060
Add that to your list of words.

604
00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:47.970
To look up this evening.

605
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:49.230
But I want to focus
for a moment.

606
00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.760
On one project we heard today,

607
00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:54.310
Because I've been
teaching for many years,

608
00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:56.350
And it really is
the first new idea.

609
00:35:56.370 --> 00:36:00.780
That also requires
an extreme act of faith.

610
00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.950
In the goodness of people.

611
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:08.260
Trevor has made an attempt
to interact with the world,

612
00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.180
And that was the assignment,

613
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.050
And if I were
an effusive person.

614
00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:16.460
Given to easy praise,
I would call that...

615
00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.280
Admirable.

616
00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.610
Now, here are the words
from today.

617
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.170
Utopian, enigma, quantum.
I'm gonna add variegated.

618
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:24.470
I want you to go home tonight...

619
00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:30.450
Hey, mr. Simonet.

620
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:31.860
Hello.

621
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:43.970
Were you just being nice?

622
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.150
About what?

623
00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:49.150
About my idea.

624
00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.710
Do you think it's good,
or were you just...

625
00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:52.990
Being teachery?

626
00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:55.500
Teachery?

627
00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.670
Bullshitting.

628
00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:02.090
Do I strike you
as someone falsely nice?

629
00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:06.770
No. You're not even
really all that nice.

630
00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:10.810
Well, it was a slip-up,

631
00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:13.870
And it will not happen again.

632
00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:20.050
What?

633
00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:24.370
What happened to your face?

634
00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:44.540
Did you draw the short
straw today, trevor?

635
00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:47.350
It's not
a very pertinent subject.

636
00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:49.430
To social studies, is it?

637
00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.560
You can go back and
tell them that's what I said.

638
00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.780
Tell who?

639
00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:54.800
See you tomorrow.

640
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:21.360
Do you know where jerry is?

641
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:23.550
Over there, at the gate.

642
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.330
It's more product.

643
00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.920
Man: Who is it?

644
00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:04.630
Trevor: It's trevor.
I'm looking for jerry.

645
00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:07.630
Jerry's not here.

646
00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:09.810
Trevor: When will he be back?

647
00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:14.330
Man: He's not coming back.
Now get outta here.

648
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:21.330
Jerry?

649
00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:25.500
Man: Get outta here!

650
00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:28.110
Please come out, jerry.

651
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:48.880
I remember 1976.
There were those programs.

652
00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:52.290
In the school system.
Now it's... all that's gone.

653
00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:54.820
Man: I gotta go.

654
00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:56.210
Trevor.

655
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:57.980
You ran out of class
this morning very fast.

656
00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.420
I wanted to talk to you.

657
00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:53.070
Hello.

658
00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:54.150
Hello.

659
00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.180
Come in.

660
00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.930
Trevor's not feeling good.
He's in his room.

661
00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:07.330
Oh, I'm sorry.
What's the matter?

662
00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:09.000
Just a tummyache.

663
00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:10.450
Do you want to come in?

664
00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:14.180
Sure.

665
00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:17.970
Uh, sit down. Thank you.

666
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:19.470
It's a very beautiful home.

667
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:20.470
Thank you.

668
00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:21.890
Have, uh, you lived in vegas.

669
00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.750
Your whole life? Yeah.

670
00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.910
I was surprised
you wanted to do this.

671
00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:33.660
I told him if you
wanted to talk to me,

672
00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:35.380
I would come to the school.

673
00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:40.010
Mrs. Mckinney,
I didn't ask to see you.

674
00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:42.650
Well, trevor said you did.

675
00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:46.690
Yeah, and he gave me
a note from you...

676
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:49.280
Which you didn't write.

677
00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.720
He gave you a note from me?

678
00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:56.290
Oh, god, that's horrible.

679
00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.430
He's been so...
no, I didn't mean you.

680
00:42:58.450 --> 00:42:59.860
Oh, no explanation
required. I'll go.

681
00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:00.870
I didn't mean you.

682
00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:02.040
No, you don't have to...

683
00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:05.010
Hey, it's not personal.
Would you stop?

684
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:08.050
Can we just rewind here
a little bit?

685
00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:12.970
I obviously didn't realize
how much trevor likes you.

686
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.560
Well, that's nothing
that we can't discuss.

687
00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:16.810
On parent-teacher night.

688
00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.650
Then why did you come?

689
00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:22.040
Why did you come here?
Why didn't you just tell me.

690
00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:23.730
To come to the school?

691
00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:29.840
Because you came to the school.

692
00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:31.480
To talk to me about your son,

693
00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:34.760
And I behaved like a...

694
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:37.100
An asshole?

695
00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:40.940
Sorry. Is that
too trailer trash.

696
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:42.000
A word for you?

697
00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:45.790
How does rat bastard
sit with you?

698
00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:47.290
That's pretty good.

699
00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:48.520
Dickhead?

700
00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:49.770
Oh, I like that.

701
00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:54.140
Look, I'm...

702
00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:11.420
I, um, I made all this food.

703
00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.730
It's just sittin' here, um...

704
00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:21.590
I really don't know
who else to talk to about him.

705
00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:24.380
Mmm. This is good.

706
00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.850
Thanks.

707
00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:27.700
I don't understand.
This is summer school?

708
00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.640
Uh-huh.

709
00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.640
Why do you think
trevor stopped talking?

710
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:36.770
I don't know. He seems mad.

711
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:38.640
Well, seventh grade
is difficult,

712
00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:40.310
But he seems
very happy at school.

713
00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:44.650
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe it's fine.

714
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:46.400
How much do you see him?

715
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:48.120
As much as I can.

716
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:49.290
How much is that?

717
00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:52.750
No, I'm not doin'
a bunch of skanky guys.

718
00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:54.720
Instead of spending time
with my son, ok?

719
00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:57.560
I got 2 jobs.

720
00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:01.850
Right. I meant that.

721
00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:05.210
Couldn't have just
been a question.

722
00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:09.410
Uh, mrs. Mckinney, do you think.

723
00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.700
There might be something,

724
00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.920
Um, I don't know,
outside of school.

725
00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:14.710
That might be bothering him?

726
00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:17.420
I don't know.

727
00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:21.990
Ok, you know, I'm
gonna have to consult.

728
00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:23.780
My spirit guides here,
because you tell me.

729
00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.110
That trevor's
withholding from you,

730
00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:26.920
But you won't tell me
anything specific,

731
00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.220
And you still
want me to sit here.

732
00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:29.340
And divine why.

733
00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.540
Divine why?

734
00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.670
You always talk like that?

735
00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:34.780
Yes.

736
00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.590
You go to some
big, fancy school?

737
00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:39.410
Yes.

738
00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:41.710
Think you could stop
rubbing my nose in it?

739
00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.260
Is there a father?

740
00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.880
He doesn't live here anymore.

741
00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:54.020
I don't know where he is.

742
00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:56.020
Yeah. I know what that's like.

743
00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:59.260
Bonnie: Arlene,
I've called you 5 times.

744
00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.600
Did you slip or what?

745
00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:01.850
Bonnie. No, listen,

746
00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:03.380
You don't call your sponsor
once in a while,

747
00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.400
You don't have a sponsor.

748
00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:05.640
Bonnie! What?

749
00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:08.710
Arlene: This is eugene simonet.

750
00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:11.220
You're not supposed
to date for a year.

751
00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:12.200
Arlene: This isn't a date.

752
00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:13.450
No, I'm... I'm trevor's teacher.

753
00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:14.460
It isn't. It's...

754
00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:15.520
We're having a conference,

755
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.450
And, uh, we were
through. We're done.

756
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:20.280
Arlene: We're done.

757
00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:40.790
How could you do that to me?

758
00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:43.530
Write a letter to him?
Sign my name?

759
00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:45.250
Why'd you have
to mess everything up?

760
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:47.080
Oh, no. I didn't mess this up.

761
00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:48.090
What were you doing,

762
00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:49.090
Just standing at the door.

763
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:50.590
Listening to everything?

764
00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:51.930
What happened
to your stomachache?

765
00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:53.600
What do you care?
You always lie.

766
00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:55.220
Trevor, this wasn't my fault.

767
00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:56.600
This whole thing
was embarrassing.

768
00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:58.720
I did something good,
and you don't even know it.

769
00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:01.880
Honey, listen.

770
00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:03.630
You can't just put
2 people together.

771
00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:04.640
And make 'em like each other.

772
00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:05.890
It doesn't work that way.

773
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:08.410
You only like people
you can get drunk with.

774
00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.200
You're just waiting
for him to come back.

775
00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:13.200
No, I'm not.

776
00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:14.540
Yes, you are. No, I'm not.

777
00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:15.910
Yes, you are! No, I'm not!

778
00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:16.960
Your father's not gettin'

779
00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:17.960
His foot through...

780
00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:18.960
That's what you always say.

781
00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:19.960
Well, I mean it now.

782
00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:21.080
You always mean it.

783
00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:22.390
What do you want me to say?

784
00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:24.120
I say it, I mean it.
I mean it now.

785
00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:25.410
Not when he's around.
When he's around,

786
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:26.540
You don't care
what happens to me.

787
00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:27.920
You don't ev...
you don't even know

788
00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:29.080
I'm in the same house.

789
00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:30.080
That's not true. It is true.

790
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.250
You know... it's true.

791
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:33.220
Listen, I love you.

792
00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.390
I love you.

793
00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:35.930
I'm doing the best I can.

794
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:37.310
I don't want you to love me.

795
00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:39.070
I hate the way you look.
I hate the way you smell.

796
00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:40.050
I hate the way you are.

797
00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:41.230
I hate that you're my mother.

798
00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:27.540
Trev?

799
00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:33.170
Trev, I'm gonna come in, ok?

800
00:49:43.610 --> 00:49:46.100
He said that an hour ago.

801
00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:51.190
Do... do you understand
my kid is missing?

802
00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:54.960
If I had a car,
I'd be out looking for him!

803
00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:09.290
What time do you
think he took off?

804
00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:13.050
I don't know.
I'm sorry to do this to you.

805
00:50:13.070 --> 00:50:15.300
Bonnie wasn't home,
the cops wouldn't come...

806
00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:16.520
It's ok.

807
00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:17.960
And I would have called
one of my friends,

808
00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:18.960
But my friends are all drunks...

809
00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:21.350
It's ok. And so am I.

810
00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:23.480
I'm a drunk, too.

811
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:28.760
I believe some
people refer to that.

812
00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:29.980
As "in recovery."

813
00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:41.320
Where you going?

814
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:08.800
Hey. You got enough?

815
00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:11.230
You need a ticket somewhere?

816
00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:13.680
How much? Hmm? Come with me.

817
00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:14.900
I'll get you there.

818
00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.350
I'll get you a ticket,
you son of a bitch.

819
00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:18.370
Honey, are you ok?

820
00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:22.050
Man: Oh! Aah!

821
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:41.170
Trev, for the rest of my life,

822
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:42.950
I could never be as
sorry about anything.

823
00:51:42.970 --> 00:51:44.940
As I am for what I did to you.

824
00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:55.780
I didn't drink.

825
00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:58.220
I wanted to, but I didn't.

826
00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:10.560
You got no reason to trust me...

827
00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:12.260
And I know you
don't want to hear.

828
00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:14.730
Any more promises,

829
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:17.340
So I'm just gonna
tell you the truth.

830
00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.030
I have a problem.

831
00:52:23.050 --> 00:52:27.260
I have a really bad problem.

832
00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.690
I gotta stop.

833
00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:34.720
And if you can
be with me on this,

834
00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:37.730
If you can think it's possible.

835
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:40.560
That I can do it...

836
00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:44.990
Then I think maybe I can...

837
00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:47.290
If you just...

838
00:52:47.310 --> 00:52:50.900
Try a little bit, and I'll try.

839
00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:14.510
Arlene: You're still here.

840
00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:15.720
Oh, yeah. I hope it's ok.

841
00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:17.050
I just wanted to make sure...

842
00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:19.040
He's asleep. Good, ok.

843
00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:20.540
How did you know where he was?

844
00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:23.350
Oh. Well, kids,
they either hitchhike,

845
00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:24.430
Or they take a bus.

846
00:53:24.450 --> 00:53:25.850
Listen, um...

847
00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:27.050
For what?

848
00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:29.610
Well, what?
Wait, give me a shot...

849
00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:31.280
No, you don't have to.
I... I understand...

850
00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:33.220
Wait! God damn,
I want to thank you.

851
00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:37.460
Thank you.

852
00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:38.540
You're welcome.

853
00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:43.590
Wasn't quite worth it, was it?

854
00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:45.090
No.

855
00:53:45.110 --> 00:53:46.260
Listen, I was wondering,

856
00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:48.980
Do you want to come
back here sometime?

857
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.200
Have dinner with me?

858
00:53:55.130 --> 00:54:00.590
I'm not entirely sure
that would be appropriate.

859
00:54:00.610 --> 00:54:03.870
Ok. I understand.

860
00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:06.450
Good night. Good night.

861
00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:20.040
Ok. Why'd you do that man
the favor, sidney?

862
00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:23.250
No, it's, like,
3 favors, player.

863
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:25.080
You gotta do 3.

864
00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:26.130
Now I'll do the other 2.

865
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:27.840
Up in here for my folks.

866
00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:28.840
You know, a lot of brothers.

867
00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:29.840
Need favors in here.

868
00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:31.390
Who told you to do it?

869
00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:38.210
It's, like, this idea I got.

870
00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:41.160
Yo, you gonna put this on tv?

871
00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:45.040
Wait. How did you come up
with an idea like that?

872
00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:47.790
Man, it's like...

873
00:54:47.810 --> 00:54:50.210
It's like the world
is a shit hole.

874
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:52.180
I mean, excuse my french
and shit, right?

875
00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:54.190
And it's like...

876
00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:56.640
I just thought, like, boom!

877
00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:59.580
Like the whole shit
could be, like, better.

878
00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:03.740
Didn't start with anyone else?

879
00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:06.410
No, nigger. That shit
came from here, all right?

880
00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:08.050
The shit came from my head.

881
00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:09.310
I mean, I can't lie to you, man,

882
00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:10.420
I-I've been through...

883
00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:14.510
Through some heavy-ass shit...

884
00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:17.480
But not no more, I mean,
'cause it changed me...

885
00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:19.190
And I'm changing
this place, man.

886
00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:22.160
I mean, people
are listening to me.

887
00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:26.120
People are staying clean.

888
00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:30.460
I mean... I mean, it's like
some cosmic aristotle shit.

889
00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:31.460
You feel me?

890
00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.380
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

891
00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.220
Yeah, no doubt. I feel ya.

892
00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.550
No doubt, dog. No doubt.

893
00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:41.230
The thing is, sidney, um...

894
00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:44.150
Somebody else is saying
that "pay it forward".

895
00:55:44.170 --> 00:55:46.020
Was their idea.

896
00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:48.930
Who?

897
00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:54.440
I think you know who.

898
00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:58.340
That bitch.

899
00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:00.570
No. No. She
a lyin'-ass bitch, man,

900
00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:01.680
I'm telling you.

901
00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:03.440
She's a lyin' bitch.
She got your head.

902
00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:04.740
I'm telling you. Ok.

903
00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:06.110
Hey, she makes a pretty
good case, though, sid.

904
00:56:06.130 --> 00:56:07.860
That old crusty bag lady?

905
00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:09.700
I'm telling you, man,
this is all from me,

906
00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:10.870
All from my heart, dog.

907
00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:12.290
Ok. She said... sidney. What?

908
00:56:12.310 --> 00:56:13.510
Listen to me. It doesn't matter.

909
00:56:13.530 --> 00:56:14.790
If you got it from
the old lady or not,

910
00:56:14.810 --> 00:56:15.800
'cause you're the one
paying it forward.

911
00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:16.800
You damn right.

912
00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:18.020
In prison, no less.

913
00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:20.890
The parole board
will eat that up, sidney.

914
00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:22.060
Oh, the parole board?

915
00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:23.640
The parole board.

916
00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:28.240
Oh, snap, yo.
You good, man.

917
00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:30.740
Like a little carrot
for the mouse and shit.

918
00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:33.580
No doubt, no doubt.

919
00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:34.630
It's too bad my parole.

920
00:56:34.650 --> 00:56:35.970
Don't come up for
another year, b.

921
00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:40.990
What if I could make it.

922
00:56:41.010 --> 00:56:43.060
So your parole
comes up next month?

923
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:03.000
Arlene: Hello.

924
00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:07.290
Oh. Hello.

925
00:58:07.310 --> 00:58:10.130
Did you know I worked here?

926
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:13.720
No, I didn't. Really.

927
00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:18.010
So you just dropped in
for a little game of craps?

928
00:58:18.030 --> 00:58:23.320
No. I, uh, I like
the coffee shop.

929
00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:26.860
They... they have good food.

930
00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:30.450
Yeah. They got good pancakes.

931
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:35.100
Yeah. Fluffy.

932
00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:36.880
Do you want me.

933
00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:38.550
To bring you back something?

934
00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:41.360
Oh, no, thanks.
I get off in an hour.

935
00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:43.450
Oh, really?

936
00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:45.550
Yeah, really.

937
00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:48.910
Well...

938
00:58:48.930 --> 00:58:51.740
Well, if you were
gonna eat anyway,

939
00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:53.210
Then,

940
00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:57.220
If you, if you wanted, maybe,

941
00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:01.400
If you were hungry, we could...

942
00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:03.270
We could, if you, if you were,

943
00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:05.250
If you wanted...

944
00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:12.430
Eat something... Sometime.

945
00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:18.510
7-iron, please.

946
00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:20.150
Yes, sir.

947
00:59:31.810 --> 00:59:33.140
Can I help you?

948
00:59:34.310 --> 00:59:37.050
No, I am not stalking
the governor, jordy.

949
00:59:37.070 --> 00:59:39.690
Shit. Chandler.

950
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:42.040
You scared me.

951
00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:43.790
You look like crap.
What are you doing out here?

952
00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:44.970
I want to talk to him, jordan.

953
00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:46.630
Heh! Your questions
piss him off.

954
00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:47.800
Oh, is that why
I got the bounce?

955
00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:48.800
He won't talk to you.

956
00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:49.810
Well, tell him I'm a candygram.

957
00:59:49.830 --> 00:59:50.980
Stop it.

958
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.140
I got a better idea.
Why don't I tell him

959
00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:53.480
I've been sitting on
a story for 2 years.

960
00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:54.650
About a little party he had.

961
00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:56.540
The cleanup crew found syringes,

962
00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:58.160
Si 121/2 high heels,

963
00:59:58.180 --> 00:59:59.240
Animal droppings.

964
00:59:59.260 --> 01:00:00.830
That can't be right, can it?

965
01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:03.170
If you really had this,

966
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:04.170
You'd have used it.

967
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:05.340
Bullshit.

968
01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.590
His friends in high
places had me kill it,

969
01:00:06.610 --> 01:00:07.840
But ever since I got fired,

970
01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:09.580
I'm really not feeling
that loyal, you know?

971
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:12.020
What do you want?

972
01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:13.180
$4 million.

973
01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.410
I'm kidding, man. Relax.

974
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:18.530
Ha ha ha!

975
01:00:18.550 --> 01:00:20.030
Nothing, man. A phone call.

976
01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:21.080
I just need a little phone call.

977
01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:22.370
I need a massage.

978
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:24.040
For a friend of
mine's parole date.

979
01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:25.060
That's it.

980
01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:32.540
God, trevor.
They kept me 40 minutes over.

981
01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:33.960
Did you call him?

982
01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.210
I couldn't remember the name
of the stupid restaurant.

983
01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:36.210
I remember the name
of the hotel.

984
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:37.210
I couldn't remember the n...

985
01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:38.270
He hates people being late.

986
01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:39.220
If you're late,
he thinks it means.

987
01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.550
You don't respect him.

988
01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:41.560
What?

989
01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:43.060
If you're late, he'll think.

990
01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.000
It means you don't respect him.

991
01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:54.150
Well, I don't know.
Are you wearing this?

992
01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:55.320
No. I want to wear
the green dress.

993
01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:56.900
You look like a vampire in that.

994
01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.820
Uhh. I gotta take a shower.

995
01:00:58.840 --> 01:00:59.820
What?

996
01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:00.990
I smell horrible.

997
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:02.910
No, you don't.
No, you smell good.

998
01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:04.420
You smell like, uh,
roses or something.

999
01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:05.420
Let me just wash.

1000
01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.590
Under my arms really quick.

1001
01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:07.590
Are you sure?

1002
01:01:07.610 --> 01:01:08.780
Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure.

1003
01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.580
Trevor: Oh, wait.
Don't interrupt him.

1004
01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:21.580
When he's in the middle
of a sentence.

1005
01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:22.760
He doesn't like that, either.

1006
01:01:22.770 --> 01:01:24.290
What am I supposed to do,
raise my hand?

1007
01:01:24.310 --> 01:01:25.460
Get me my shoes, ok? No.

1008
01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.460
Those little sandals.

1009
01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.540
These.

1010
01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.460
No, no, no.
I'm not wearing those.

1011
01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.470
They're way too sexy.

1012
01:01:29.490 --> 01:01:30.970
You're too late. You owe him.

1013
01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:34.210
I owe him? Who are you?

1014
01:01:35.830 --> 01:01:38.480
Oh, and none of
those stupid jokes.

1015
01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:39.820
He's not that kind
of person, ok?

1016
01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:40.820
Thank you very much.

1017
01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:41.820
Where's the phone?

1018
01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.240
I gotta call for a cab.

1019
01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:44.240
If I take a bus,

1020
01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:45.260
It might be another hour,

1021
01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:46.250
And I'm late. No. Mom. Mom.

1022
01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:47.900
I got a call in to the cabbie.

1023
01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.490
I gotta call for a cab.

1024
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:51.810
Duh.

1025
01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:53.490
Oh, my god.

1026
01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.780
Oh, my god. You're a champ.

1027
01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:57.790
Ok. Ok, mom.

1028
01:01:57.810 --> 01:01:58.970
You're the greatest kid on...

1029
01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:00.620
Ok, mom. Ok, mom. Ok.

1030
01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.040
You have to go.
You have to go, ok?

1031
01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:03.380
Oh, here, here, here.

1032
01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.130
Go. Go.

1033
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:06.320
Lock both doors.

1034
01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:07.820
I will.

1035
01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:10.810
I love you!

1036
01:02:10.830 --> 01:02:12.670
Love you, too, mom.

1037
01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:39.270
I respect you!

1038
01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:41.450
I respect you.

1039
01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:42.760
They kept me late at work,

1040
01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:43.960
And then I got on the bus
to go home and change,

1041
01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:44.960
Which was stupid.

1042
01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:45.960
That was my fault,
and I'm sorry,

1043
01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:47.150
But I was all the way h...

1044
01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:50.820
You're right on time.

1045
01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:05.750
I'm sorry.

1046
01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:23.430
So I'm, like, living
in vegas, right, man?

1047
01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:24.570
And one night,

1048
01:03:24.590 --> 01:03:25.770
I was walking
down the street, right?

1049
01:03:25.790 --> 01:03:26.910
I'm just minding my own.

1050
01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:28.030
Brother wasn't doing
nothing to nobody.

1051
01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:30.430
I mean, I was just
on my way to church.

1052
01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.950
Just out of nowhere, man,

1053
01:03:33.970 --> 01:03:36.240
Just... just 5 bloods
just peeled out of a truck,

1054
01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:38.460
And one of 'em, man,
was real black.

1055
01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.870
Hey!

1056
01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:41.300
Man, I started
swinging one by one,

1057
01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:42.940
Like, nigger, take that.
Ba ba ba ba ba,

1058
01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:44.260
Like ali on the bitches,

1059
01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:47.000
And I was like what, what,
what, what's up, nigger?

1060
01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:48.330
What's up? Bam, bam.

1061
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:51.390
And then all
five of them got up.

1062
01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:52.890
And started chasing me, man,

1063
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:53.880
They're like,
"we gonna kill you, bitch.

1064
01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:55.080
We gonna kill you, bitch,".

1065
01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:56.580
And I was like,
"you can't catch me, blood.

1066
01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.920
You can't catch me, blood."

1067
01:03:57.940 --> 01:04:01.510
Then, man, all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

1068
01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:04.100
That's when I ran
into this old lady.

1069
01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:06.020
That's who you want
to know about.

1070
01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:15.720
Man. Uhh!

1071
01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:18.220
Aah! Shit.

1072
01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:22.550
Hey. You in trouble?

1073
01:04:23.650 --> 01:04:25.050
What?

1074
01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:26.290
Get in.

1075
01:04:26.310 --> 01:04:29.040
Get in?

1076
01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:30.780
Come on. Get in.

1077
01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:36.190

1078
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:21.130
Uhh!

1079
01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:24.870
What we doin'?

1080
01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.130
Whatever we want.

1081
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.530
Damn.

1082
01:05:32.550 --> 01:05:33.680
Now, you think I'm going.

1083
01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:37.460
For your dried-up,
crusty ass? Whatever.

1084
01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:40.850
Shoot. I smell better
than you do.

1085
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:42.800
Yeah. All right.

1086
01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:46.980
All right. So, what?
What you want?

1087
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.980
Don't matter,

1088
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.500
'cause you ain't gonna do it.

1089
01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:57.000
You're damn right about that.

1090
01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:58.270
Shit.

1091
01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:01.590
Hey, not in my car.

1092
01:06:01.610 --> 01:06:04.590
Oh, hey, hey, hey, shit.
Not in my car.

1093
01:06:04.610 --> 01:06:06.930
Oh, my... my... my bad, my bad.

1094
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:08.080
This is like your pad, right?

1095
01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:09.220
You don't want me...
you don't want me.

1096
01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:10.920
To jack up all
your pretty curtains.

1097
01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:13.430
Oh, son of a bitch.

1098
01:06:13.450 --> 01:06:14.760
I paid it forward.

1099
01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:18.600
For a hophead son of a bitch.

1100
01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:20.590
You... you paid...
you paid what?

1101
01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:21.760
I didn't hear that.

1102
01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:24.250
I ain't gonna tell you,

1103
01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:26.670
'cause your ass ain't
good enough to touch it.

1104
01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:29.110
Oh, my ass
ain't good enough, huh?

1105
01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.580
Now, you gonna tell me.

1106
01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.750
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

1107
01:06:35.770 --> 01:06:39.090
♪ You gonna tell me ♪

1108
01:06:39.110 --> 01:06:40.810
Chris: Let me
just get this straight.

1109
01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.420
Some old bat that lives
in her car in las vegas.

1110
01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:43.750
Tells you about pay it forward.

1111
01:06:43.770 --> 01:06:45.260
No. She didn't want to, man,

1112
01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.590
But, you know,
a brother wouldn't stop.

1113
01:06:46.610 --> 01:06:47.640
Until she let it out.

1114
01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:48.930
Well, what I want
to know, sidney,

1115
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:50.570
What I really want
to know is why?

1116
01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:53.270
Why did you pay it forward?

1117
01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:55.270
Because don't nobody tell me.

1118
01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:58.500
What I can and can't touch, yo.

1119
01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:02.440
Bonnie: How many times
have I told you.

1120
01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:03.340
You're not supposed
to date for a year.

1121
01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:04.990
They're not dates.

1122
01:07:05.010 --> 01:07:06.210
Oh, ok. 7 dinners.
What are they?

1123
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:07.750
No. It's a couple of adults.

1124
01:07:07.770 --> 01:07:08.770
Sitting down... and dating.

1125
01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:09.920
No. Did he pay?

1126
01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:11.090
He pays for everything.

1127
01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:13.060
Trevor, did anybody ask you?

1128
01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:14.430
He's new. He doesn't
know that many people.

1129
01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:15.430
He likes her.

1130
01:07:15.450 --> 01:07:16.430
So?

1131
01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:17.900
He fixed your tv remote.

1132
01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:19.770
Oh, that's an engagement ring.

1133
01:07:19.790 --> 01:07:21.410
And he doesn't drink.

1134
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:23.410
Do you gotta pee?

1135
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:24.770
Look.

1136
01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.200
I need a smoke.

1137
01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:29.590
There. Over there.

1138
01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:31.430
So, has he kissed you?

1139
01:07:31.450 --> 01:07:33.880
No, no, no, no, no.

1140
01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:36.440
Does he want to?

1141
01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:39.780
Sometimes I think he does.

1142
01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:43.120
He can't really want to,
or he would have.

1143
01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:45.070
Do you want him to?

1144
01:07:46.310 --> 01:07:47.410
Arlene: I don't know.

1145
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:48.740
Whoo!

1146
01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:51.820
Shit, bonnie.
It's just taking forever.

1147
01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:54.290
Haven't you ever
gotten to know somebody.

1148
01:07:54.310 --> 01:07:56.230
Before you went to bed with him?

1149
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:03.760
Is that d?

1150
01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:06.390
Bonnie: It's pathetic.

1151
01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:15.160
Well, good night.

1152
01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:17.920
Um...

1153
01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:20.760
Do you want to come in.

1154
01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:23.860
And... Stay?

1155
01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:27.430
I...

1156
01:08:27.450 --> 01:08:29.420
Come in.

1157
01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:34.110
Trevor's inside the house.

1158
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:36.420
He sleeps like the dead.

1159
01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:39.620
I don't want to make it.

1160
01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.630
Any harder for you.

1161
01:08:41.650 --> 01:08:42.660
Well,

1162
01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:43.830
You're supposed to wait a year.

1163
01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:45.470
Isn't that what
bonnie said to you?

1164
01:08:45.490 --> 01:08:48.810
Ok.

1165
01:08:48.830 --> 01:08:51.450
I...

1166
01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:54.860
I can't.

1167
01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:59.500
Oh.

1168
01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.950
I'm sorry.

1169
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:06.390
No. I don't mean I can't.

1170
01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:10.220
It's just...

1171
01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.160
What?

1172
01:09:15.250 --> 01:09:17.830
It's complicated.

1173
01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:21.240
I get it.

1174
01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:24.480
It's ok to say
you don't like me that way.

1175
01:09:28.090 --> 01:09:30.810
Is that what you think it is?

1176
01:09:30.830 --> 01:09:32.190
It's ok.

1177
01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:33.300
Arlene.

1178
01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:38.920
How could you ever think that?

1179
01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.110
What?

1180
01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:19.150
What is it?

1181
01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:47.500
And you're doing this because...

1182
01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:48.840
I need more links.

1183
01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:51.600
You're spending $300
to go to vegas.

1184
01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:52.680
And find an old lady.

1185
01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:55.190
So you can sell
a story for $300.

1186
01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:56.240
It's a news magazine
feature, rochelle.

1187
01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:57.440
All right?

1188
01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:58.940
It's not something
you wipe your ass with.

1189
01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:01.360
You have such a lovely way
of expressing yourself.

1190
01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:03.330
Hey, do me a favor.

1191
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:04.450
Don't change
the locks on me, ok?

1192
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:05.620
Hmm.

1193
01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.630
Chris, what are you
hoping this'll be?

1194
01:11:07.650 --> 01:11:08.630
Just, you know,

1195
01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:09.630
Something that clears a check.

1196
01:11:09.650 --> 01:11:10.630
You know?

1197
01:11:10.650 --> 01:11:12.890
Are you sure that's all?

1198
01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:16.530
Look. Ok. I, uh, I drank
the last of the coffee.

1199
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:17.810
Please put it on the list.

1200
01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:18.970
Huh.

And as long as I have that...

1258
01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:34.190
As long as I have that...

1259
01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:35.980
I'm ok, I'm ok.

1260
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.230
If I don't have it, I'm lost.

1261
01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:38.980
So is that all you want?

1262
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.370
Your god damn manageable day?

1263
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:42.410
It's what I have.

1264
01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:44.800
No, it isn't.
Is it what you want?

1265
01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:46.250
Yes! It's what I want!

1266
01:13:46.270 --> 01:13:47.940
I don't believe you.

1267
01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.750
Ok. That's the best I got.

1268
01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:55.750
It's not about you...

1269
01:13:55.770 --> 01:13:56.840
Yes, it is!

1270
01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:58.970
Something's been
offered to you here,

1271
01:13:58.990 --> 01:14:00.680
And you don't want it.

1272
01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:02.430
Maybe you're scared
to get rejected.

1273
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:03.650
Well, I can't reject you.

1274
01:14:03.670 --> 01:14:05.090
You're too quick for me!

1275
01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.970
Hey.

1276
01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:33.370
You didn't call me
a fag, did you?

1277
01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:39.900
Hey, look what I found!

1278
01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:41.020
What do you want?!
Give me that!

1279
01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.440
It's my asthma spray!

1280
01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:43.410
Shut up!

1281
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:45.010
Adam: Stop it!

1282
01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:46.130
Stay still!

1283
01:14:46.150 --> 01:14:47.130
Stop! Help me!

1284
01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:48.130
Hold still!

1285
01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:49.820
Hey!

1286
01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:54.810
Hey, mckinney.

1287
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:55.810
Come here.

1288
01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:57.990
Boy: Yeah, let's hang out.

1289
01:14:58.010 --> 01:15:01.690
Help me. Please.

1290
01:15:01.710 --> 01:15:03.350
Screw it.
He's not doing anything.

1291
01:15:03.370 --> 01:15:04.460
Come on.

1292
01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:06.770
Let me go! Let me go!

1293
01:15:24.210 --> 01:15:25.570
Trevor...

1294
01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:28.960
You cut my class.

1295
01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:32.720
It's been 4 days.

1296
01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:36.880
What's been 4 days?

1297
01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:38.000
Why haven't you
called my mother?

1298
01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:39.820
It's been 4 days.

1299
01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:49.540
I don't know.

1300
01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:53.960
Neither does she.

1301
01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:03.730
Hey, what's the matter?

1302
01:16:09.210 --> 01:16:12.310
Pay it forward didn't work.

1303
01:16:12.330 --> 01:16:14.300
I couldn't even do it.

1304
01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:21.510
I was gonna help adam.

1305
01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:29.310
Help adam do what?

1306
01:16:29.330 --> 01:16:30.950
Not get beat up.

1307
01:16:32.170 --> 01:16:34.500
But I crapped out,
and I let him.

1308
01:16:38.350 --> 01:16:40.130
I let him get beat.

1309
01:16:41.550 --> 01:16:43.510
No, you didn't.
You didn't let him get beat.

1310
01:16:43.530 --> 01:16:46.600
It just... it...
it happens, you know?

1311
01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:49.370
Trevor, sometimes
there's nothing we can do.

1312
01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.390
It's not fair.

1313
01:16:52.410 --> 01:16:54.440
I know... no!

1314
01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:56.550
You don't know.

1315
01:16:57.890 --> 01:16:59.620
You should call my mother.

1316
01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:00.660
You could do something.

1317
01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:02.790
If you wanted.

1318
01:17:02.810 --> 01:17:04.900
Why are you so chicken?

1319
01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.180
Trevor, I'm not chicken...

1320
01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:07.200
Something's gonna happen.

1321
01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.960
Then it'll be too late.

1322
01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:14.580
What's gonna happen?
What do you mean?

1323
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:18.310
He'll come back.

1324
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:22.660
Who will come back?

1325
01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:24.430
Hey, who will come...

1326
01:17:30.430 --> 01:17:32.250
Your dad.

1327
01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:39.260
Your dad will come back?

1328
01:17:41.850 --> 01:17:43.640
And...

1329
01:17:45.730 --> 01:17:46.790
What will happen.

1330
01:17:46.810 --> 01:17:49.110
When he comes back, trevor?

1331
01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:54.540
Will he hurt you?

1332
01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:02.340
Will he hurt her?

1333
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:11.270
Not if someone's there...

1334
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:14.920
Instead of him.

1335
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:19.860
Trevor...

1336
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:25.650
Trevor, it's...

1337
01:18:25.670 --> 01:18:28.660
It's complicated
for me now. I...

1338
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:34.890
Is the world just shit?

1339
01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.150
No, it isn't.

1340
01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:44.040
Hey.

1341
01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:45.960
You did good work.

1342
01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:48.710
Look at me.
I'm proud of you, trevor.

1343
01:18:48.730 --> 01:18:50.700
I'm proud of you.

1344
01:18:54.330 --> 01:18:57.450
And anyway, for what it's worth,

1345
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:58.670
I'm grading you on the effort,

1346
01:18:58.670 --> 01:19:00.420
Not the result.

1347
01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:07.430
I don't care about the grade.

1348
01:19:21.630 --> 01:19:22.830
I just wanted to see.

1349
01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:25.050
If the world
would really change.

1350
01:20:03.010 --> 01:20:05.110
Hi.

1351
01:20:05.130 --> 01:20:07.210
Hi.

1352
01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:11.220
Uh, come in.

1353
01:22:09.790 --> 01:22:11.890
Ohh! Trevor!

1354
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:12.940
It worked!

1355
01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:14.690
Oh, god!

1356
01:22:16.730 --> 01:22:18.550
Eugene: Does he always
get up this early?

1357
01:22:18.570 --> 01:22:19.600
What?

1358
01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:20.970
Oh, my god, this is not good.

1359
01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:21.970
He just saw me!

1360
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:23.560
It's ok!

1361
01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:25.400
Now you have to
pay it forward, too!

1362
01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:26.850
Trevor: Eugene?

1363
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:27.880
I think you should.

1364
01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:29.970
Still call me mr. Simonet.

1365
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.970
You had a sleepover, didn't you?

1366
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:31.980
Why don't you go back to bed?

1367
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.030
Why?

1368
01:22:33.050 --> 01:22:34.150
It's too early
for you to be up...

1369
01:22:34.170 --> 01:22:35.450
No, it's not early!
No, it's a Sunday!

1370
01:22:35.470 --> 01:22:36.450
It's a Sunday?

1371
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:37.700
Yeah.

1372
01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:38.790
So stay, stay!

1373
01:22:38.810 --> 01:22:39.790
You don't understand,

1374
01:22:39.810 --> 01:22:40.790
I have a whole schedule.

1375
01:22:40.810 --> 01:22:41.910
That you don't know about.

1376
01:22:41.930 --> 01:22:43.500
All right, well,
bring everything here!

1377
01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:44.970
Would you please
take care of him?

1378
01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:46.670
I'll call you later, all right?

1379
01:22:46.690 --> 01:22:47.720
Don't be a stranger!

1380
01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:48.810
God, trevor!

1381
01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:50.110
Trevor: Do you like him?

1382
01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:28.170
Ok.

1383
01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:14.790
Hey! Hey, hey!

1384
01:24:14.810 --> 01:24:16.330
Lady, come on.

1385
01:24:16.350 --> 01:24:17.780
Go away.

1386
01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:20.430
I-I'm not gonna hurt you, lady.

1387
01:24:20.450 --> 01:24:21.840
Oh, here, take it!

1388
01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:22.900
Well, it's a nice thought,

1389
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:24.310
But it's not what I want.

1390
01:24:24.330 --> 01:24:26.350
What... what...

1391
01:24:26.370 --> 01:24:27.930
Hey, what are you doing?

1392
01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:30.440
I'm not gonna hurt you!

1393
01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:32.740
What are you... hey!

1394
01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:35.830
Oh, my god! Listen to me.

1395
01:24:35.850 --> 01:24:36.870
Nothing's this important!

1396
01:24:36.890 --> 01:24:39.170
Come on, come... come down here!

1397
01:24:39.190 --> 01:24:40.620
What are you doing?

1398
01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:42.990
Woman: What do
you care, anyway?

1399
01:24:43.010 --> 01:24:44.360
Because I owe somebody a favor.

1400
01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:46.370
Not me.

1401
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:47.920
Why not you?

1402
01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:49.370
You know... heh!

1403
01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:50.880
A minute ago,

1404
01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:52.380
All I could think about.

1405
01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:55.030
Was getting my next fix,

1406
01:24:55.050 --> 01:24:58.170
And then I saw you, a-and...

1407
01:24:58.190 --> 01:24:59.590
I changed my thinking.

1408
01:24:59.610 --> 01:25:00.930
Oh, please!

1409
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:02.260
Go away!

1410
01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:04.390
Trust me, I'm not worth it.

1411
01:25:04.410 --> 01:25:06.440
Why's that?

1412
01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:07.720
Oh, for god's sake!

1413
01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:08.780
Come on, tell me!

1414
01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:11.280
Why are you not worth it?

1415
01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:13.740
Trust me...

1416
01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:15.990
You wouldn't understand.

1417
01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:17.910
Are you kidding me?

1418
01:25:17.930 --> 01:25:20.020
You think I live at the ritz?

1419
01:25:23.710 --> 01:25:26.530
Have a cup of coffee with me?

1420
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:29.900
What?

1421
01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:39.490
Do me a favor.

1422
01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:43.210
Save my life.

1423
01:25:51.630 --> 01:25:52.610
Get him! Get him!

1424
01:25:52.630 --> 01:25:53.950
Off the ropes! Off the ropes!

1425
01:25:53.970 --> 01:25:55.570
Oh, he missed him.

1426
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:58.020
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, he did!

1427
01:25:58.040 --> 01:25:59.420
Bam-ba-bam-ba-bam-ba-bam!

1428
01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:02.210
Oh, oh, come on, bleed, dude.

1429
01:26:02.230 --> 01:26:03.420
Announcer: Distraction
from the imperial...

1430
01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:04.580
Oh, he's got him. Give the ddt!

1431
01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:06.220
What?

1432
01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:07.340
It's gonna be a ddt.

1433
01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:08.800
Up he goes,
and drop him on his head!

1434
01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:13.000
Oh, he's dead. He's dead.

1435
01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:14.550
Ok, fearless,
get out of the ring.

1436
01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:15.610
What do you mean,
get out of the ring?

1437
01:26:15.630 --> 01:26:16.640
You can't get out of t ring.

1438
01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:17.890
Yes, he can.
He has to get a chair.

1439
01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:19.230
A chair?

1440
01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:21.980
Bam!

1441
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.690
Aah!

1442
01:26:23.710 --> 01:26:24.710
Slow motion.

1443
01:26:28.130 --> 01:26:29.500
Hyah!

1444
01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:32.190
Trevor, when did you
become so violent?

1445
01:26:32.210 --> 01:26:34.590
Oh, no, no, no.
Take me to a match.

1446
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:36.060
You get splattered
in the front row.

1447
01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:37.430
I don't want to be
splattered, thank you...

1448
01:26:37.450 --> 01:26:39.570
Yes, you do. It'll be, like,

1449
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:40.940
Your birthday present to me.

1450
01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:42.160
Oh, no. You know what you're
getting for your birthday?

1451
01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:43.160
What?

1452
01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:44.530
A brand-new encyclopedia...

1453
01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:45.750
Oh, ohh.

1454
01:26:45.770 --> 01:26:47.100
Leather-bound...

1455
01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:50.190
Thucydides' history
of the peloponnesian war.

1456
01:26:50.210 --> 01:26:52.780
No, I'm getting you
51 crackling volumes.

1457
01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:55.750
There'll be
pop quizzes every day.

1458
01:26:55.770 --> 01:26:57.790
On the development
of cotton farms...

1459
01:26:57.810 --> 01:26:58.790
Hi, arlene.

1460
01:26:58.810 --> 01:27:00.280
Unh!

1461
01:27:45.310 --> 01:27:47.730
You can't stay here, ricky.

1462
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:49.700
I know.

1463
01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:51.370
Look, I know what we had.

1464
01:27:51.390 --> 01:27:53.160
Was a nightmare, arlene,

1465
01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:55.410
But I did it.

1466
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:56.750
You did what?

1467
01:27:56.770 --> 01:27:58.470
I knew I couldn't come back.

1468
01:27:58.490 --> 01:28:01.360
To this house
unless I was sober.

1469
01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:05.100
It's the truth.

1470
01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:08.360
5 months, 2 weeks, and 4 days.

1471
01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:09.860
Of the truth.

1472
01:28:11.210 --> 01:28:12.360
Where you been?

1473
01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:13.830
What does it matter?

1474
01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:15.840
I knew I had to change.

1475
01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:17.870
Are you sober?

1476
01:28:17.890 --> 01:28:21.300
Yeah, and I got sober
staying right here.

1477
01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:23.130
Well, you're stronger than me.

1478
01:28:23.150 --> 01:28:25.360
Can you just stop
for a minute...

1479
01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:27.230
Please?

1480
01:28:27.250 --> 01:28:29.910
Can we just sit down and talk?

1481
01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:32.920
Ok.

1482
01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:49.420
Hi.

1483
01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:50.420
God!

1484
01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:52.260
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1485
01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:53.680
What are you doing here?

1486
01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:55.010
I want you to understand...

1487
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:56.350
Oh, it's not necessary, really.

1488
01:29:56.370 --> 01:29:57.570
No explanation required.

1489
01:29:57.590 --> 01:30:00.020
Please don't talk
to me like that.

1490
01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:03.030
We had 13 years in, eugene.

1491
01:30:03.050 --> 01:30:04.190
He's sober now.

1492
01:30:04.210 --> 01:30:05.580
We've never been sober together.

1493
01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:06.700
Well, I wish you luck.

1494
01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:09.870
I feel like I gotta
give him a chance.

1495
01:30:09.890 --> 01:30:11.380
A chance?

1496
01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:12.510
A chance for what?

1497
01:30:12.530 --> 01:30:14.850
To change,

1498
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:17.300
To try to make up for lost time.

1499
01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:19.640
Oh, what, to take trevor
to some ball games?

1500
01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:21.190
Do some real daddy
things with him?

1501
01:30:21.210 --> 01:30:22.200
Yeah.

1502
01:30:22.220 --> 01:30:23.900
He promised to try.

1503
01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:24.920
What do you want me to do?

1504
01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:26.300
Oh, I don't know, be smart.

1505
01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.440
He's his father, eugene.

1506
01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:29.190
He impregnated you, arlene.

1507
01:30:29.210 --> 01:30:31.780
In what other way has he
been a father to trevor?

1508
01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:34.900
Unless knocking somebody
around is a new family value.

1509
01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:36.240
What are you talking about?

1510
01:30:36.260 --> 01:30:37.580
He never touched trevor.

1511
01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:39.500
Oh, that's right.

1512
01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:41.250
Only you.

1513
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:43.020
He only took it out on you.

1514
01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:44.660
That's so much better.

1515
01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:49.680
What did trevor tell you?

1516
01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:51.490
Enough.

1517
01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:54.110
Christ, arlene. Secrets
like that shouldn't be kept.

1518
01:30:54.130 --> 01:30:55.660
What good does it do trevor?

1519
01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:57.830
You weren't there.
Ricky never meant to hit me.

1520
01:30:57.850 --> 01:30:58.950
We were drunk...

1521
01:30:58.970 --> 01:31:01.440
Christ! What is it
with women like you?

1522
01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:02.770
Is that something you
really tell yourself?

1523
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:05.500
"Oh, it's ok he beat me.
Trevor's ok"?

1524
01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:07.830
Trevor has locked
himself in a bathroom,

1525
01:31:07.850 --> 01:31:09.290
And he can't breathe,

1526
01:31:09.310 --> 01:31:11.090
And he's... and he's
hoping and praying.

1527
01:31:11.110 --> 01:31:12.090
That it will stop.

1528
01:31:12.110 --> 01:31:13.260
Trevor never went through...

1529
01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:15.300
How do you know what
trevor went through?

1530
01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:17.140
How do you know?

1531
01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:19.220
How do you know that
next time after you,

1532
01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:21.140
He doesn't come for trevor?

1533
01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:23.650
I know what I'm
talking about, arlene.

1534
01:31:23.670 --> 01:31:26.320
My father got on his knees.

1535
01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:27.790
And begged my mother,

1536
01:31:27.810 --> 01:31:28.910
And my mother,

1537
01:31:28.930 --> 01:31:30.830
She always took him back.

1538
01:31:30.850 --> 01:31:32.630
I never understood it.

1539
01:31:32.650 --> 01:31:34.340
She covered the bruises
and the cuts,

1540
01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:36.340
And she'd take him back.

1541
01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:38.490
Because he begged.

1542
01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:40.380
And he cried.

1543
01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:42.080
And now you ask me
what happened.

1544
01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:43.090
After he came back.

1545
01:31:43.110 --> 01:31:44.070
No... no, go on!

1546
01:31:44.090 --> 01:31:45.210
You said you wanted to know.

1547
01:31:45.230 --> 01:31:46.190
What happened to me.
Now ask me.

1548
01:31:46.210 --> 01:31:47.390
I don't like this.

1549
01:31:47.410 --> 01:31:49.550
Did he hurt you,
eugene? Ask me!

1550
01:31:51.050 --> 01:31:52.170
Did he hurt you?

1551
01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:54.790
Not for long.

1552
01:31:54.810 --> 01:31:58.000
By 13, I was gone.
I ran away...

1553
01:31:58.020 --> 01:31:59.920
But I missed her,

1554
01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:02.170
So I had to go back and see her.

1555
01:32:02.190 --> 01:32:05.090
And so one night, I did.

1556
01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:06.730
Now ask me what
happened that night.

1557
01:32:06.750 --> 01:32:08.940
What happened that night
you came back, eugene?

1558
01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:10.350
What happened?

1559
01:32:10.370 --> 01:32:11.770
He was there...

1560
01:32:11.790 --> 01:32:13.660
Drunk as usual.

1561
01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:15.750
Only this time,
I wasn't the same.

1562
01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:17.540
I was 16 years old,

1563
01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:20.040
And I was no longer
afraid of him.

1564
01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:21.710
And when I looked
him in the eye.

1565
01:32:21.730 --> 01:32:23.850
And told him if he
ever touched her again

1566
01:32:23.870 --> 01:32:24.850
I would kill him,

1567
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:26.770
He knew...

1568
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:28.720
He knew that
he would never exist.

1569
01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:30.980
For me again.

1570
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.260
And I'm standing
in front of the house.

1571
01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:34.850
I'm telling her,

1572
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:36.100
I'm screaming
for her to come out.

1573
01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:37.640
I'm telling her
she doesn't have to...

1574
01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:39.060
She doesn't have
to take it anymore.

1575
01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:40.040
She really doesn't.

1576
01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:41.060
She can come with me now.

1577
01:32:41.070 --> 01:32:42.430
I don't even see it coming.

1578
01:32:42.450 --> 01:32:43.550
He hits me in
the side of the head.

1579
01:32:43.570 --> 01:32:44.550
With a 2x4,

1580
01:32:44.570 --> 01:32:45.810
And I'm bleeding from my ear.

1581
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:47.440
And then he's dragging me.

1582
01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:48.610
He's dragging me
behind the house.

1583
01:32:48.630 --> 01:32:49.980
And into the garage,
and then he's gone.

1584
01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.200
A minute, 5 minutes,
I don't know.

1585
01:32:52.220 --> 01:32:53.990
And then he's back, and
he's wetting me down.

1586
01:32:54.010 --> 01:32:56.460
He's wetting me down,
and I don't understand.

1587
01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:59.080
I don't understand why water...

1588
01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:01.920
Should smell so bad.

1589
01:33:01.940 --> 01:33:03.720
I don't understand.

1590
01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:06.650
And then I see it.

1591
01:33:06.670 --> 01:33:08.450
I see...

1592
01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:11.920
This...

1593
01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:17.250
This gas can,

1594
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:22.560
This red gas can from his trunk.

1595
01:33:27.490 --> 01:33:30.490
And he looks at me
one last time...

1596
01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:34.250
And he lights a match.

1597
01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:41.050
And the last thing I remember...

1598
01:33:41.070 --> 01:33:43.580
And I'll never forget it...

1599
01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:45.400
Were his eyes.

1600
01:33:47.190 --> 01:33:51.180
His eyes because they
were filled with this...

1601
01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:54.690
Immense...

1602
01:33:54.710 --> 01:33:57.880
Satisfaction.

1603
01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:02.120
I'm so sorry...

1604
01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:05.940
Don't... don't... don't tell me
how sorry you are for me!

1605
01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:07.980
Just tell me how
you're gonna stop it.

1606
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.020
Happening to trevor.

1607
01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:11.490
Ricky would never do that.

1608
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:15.010
Oh, jesus, arlene.
He doesn't have to.

1609
01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:19.270
All he has to do
is not love him.

1610
01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:20.540

01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:40.910
What's going on?
What's going on?

1616
01:35:40.930 --> 01:35:42.080
What are you doing?

1617
01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:43.380
What's it look like I'm doing?

1618
01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:45.470
What are you putting in my room?

1619
01:35:45.490 --> 01:35:48.090
We had an agreement.

1620
01:35:48.110 --> 01:35:50.390
My son won't talk to me.

1621
01:35:50.410 --> 01:35:52.010
He won't even look at me!

1622
01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:53.030
What the hell did you do.

1623
01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:54.020
To turn him against me?

1624
01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:55.320
I didn't do anything.

1625
01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:56.520
I told you I wasn't gonna
make him talk to you.

1626
01:35:56.540 --> 01:35:58.610
You could go get a job.

1627
01:35:58.630 --> 01:36:00.030
What am I supposed
to use for a car?

1628
01:36:00.050 --> 01:36:01.580
The bus. That's what I do.

1629
01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:03.030
Yeah, that'll be the day.

1630
01:36:03.050 --> 01:36:05.120
Ricky, you can't
stay in this room.

1631
01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:06.300
Look, this is our room, baby.

1632
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:08.300
Ok, this is our house.
This is our bed...

1633
01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:09.300
You've been drinking.

1634
01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:10.300
Kiss me. Stop it.

1635
01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:12.790

All right, bring them up.

1664
01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:03.900
Thank you. Carefully.

1665
01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:09.140
Thank you. Careful. Did you
get rid of your hiccups?

1666
01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:10.350
Girl: Yes. Good.

1667
01:38:10.370 --> 01:38:12.070
I told you holding
your breath would work.

1668
01:38:12.090 --> 01:38:13.070
Thank you.

1669
01:38:13.090 --> 01:38:15.820
Careful. Thank you.

1670
01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:19.830
Thanks. That's very nice.

1671
01:38:19.850 --> 01:38:21.450
Give me that one.

1672
01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:25.210
Thank you. Thank you.

1673
01:38:25.230 --> 01:38:27.380
Thank you. Thank you.

1674
01:38:36.170 --> 01:38:37.820
Trevor, what is it?

1675
01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:41.470
Are you still gonna
pay it forward?

1676
01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:49.660
You could say you don't have to.

1677
01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:52.240
'Cause it didn't work out.

1678
01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:55.020
But I thought you still might.

1679
01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:04.450
Trevor, I would like
more than anything.

1680
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:06.370
To do that for you.

1681
01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:09.040
And when I find
something worthy of...

1682
01:39:09.060 --> 01:39:11.130
I know somebody
who needs something.

1683
01:39:11.150 --> 01:39:13.630
Trevor, you have to let
me find this on my own.

1684
01:39:13.650 --> 01:39:15.720
You know who it is.

1685
01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:19.960
Look...

1686
01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:23.970
You don't understand
everything, all right?

1687
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:26.810
So you do not know
what you're asking.

1688
01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:29.620
Give her another chance.

1689
01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:36.510
I will pay it forward,
I promise you that...

1690
01:39:36.530 --> 01:39:39.000
But I cannot do that.

1691
01:39:52.410 --> 01:39:55.370
But that's why
this is the one...

1692
01:39:55.390 --> 01:39:58.150
Because it's supposed to be.

1693
01:39:58.170 --> 01:39:59.670
Something hard.

1694
01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:04.080
If you hp my mom,

1695
01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:05.670
Even if you're still mad at her,

1696
01:40:05.690 --> 01:40:06.690
If you helped her in a way.

1697
01:40:06.690 --> 01:40:07.810
Nobody else could...

1698
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:08.980
Did she ask you
to come talk to me...

1699
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.410
No. She thinks you'll
never forgive her,

1700
01:40:10.430 --> 01:40:12.320
But I still think you could.

1701
01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:17.490
If you wanted to do
something really huge...

1702
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.120
For someone...

1703
01:40:24.670 --> 01:40:26.160
For my project...

1704
01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:32.890
For me.

1705
01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:40.130
Trevor, she made her choice.

1706
01:40:40.150 --> 01:40:41.890
She said she made a mistake.

1707
01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:44.240
Well, that's
the beauty of hindsight.

1708
01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:03.480
You don't care.

1709
01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:08.220
Yes, I do.

1710
01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:10.810
I will always care.

1711
01:41:10.830 --> 01:41:13.030
About you, always.

1712
01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:17.670
Yeah.

1713
01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:21.050
You're my teacher.

1714
01:41:21.070 --> 01:41:23.600
They pay you to.

1715
01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:12.580
You got it?

1716
01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:13.650
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.

1717
01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:20.590
I ain't saying a thing
till I get one more.

1718
01:42:20.610 --> 01:42:23.270
You know...

1719
01:42:23.290 --> 01:42:25.670
I thought you might
feel that way.

1720
01:42:28.850 --> 01:42:31.470
Uh-uh, no, no. Later.

1721
01:42:40.370 --> 01:42:42.470
I got my places,

1722
01:42:42.490 --> 01:42:44.810
Places...

1723
01:42:44.830 --> 01:42:47.630
Where nobody cares where
you park overnight.

1724
01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:53.960
Places where I live.

1725
01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:59.170
Anybody who knows me
knows where to find me.

1726
01:43:12.010 --> 01:43:13.680
Hi, mom.

1727
01:43:15.650 --> 01:43:16.970
What are you doing here?

1728
01:43:16.990 --> 01:43:18.610
I wanted to see you.

1729
01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:22.510
After 3 years...

1730
01:43:22.530 --> 01:43:25.700
I couldn't... I can't
watch you do this.

1731
01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:31.080
I drive by your house.

1732
01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:32.630
I know.

1733
01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:35.370
He's big.

1734
01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:36.390
Yeah.

1735
01:43:39.370 --> 01:43:41.220
What are you doing here?

1736
01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:43.220
Are... are you...

1737
01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:45.890
Are you gonna try
to put me somewhere?

1738
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:47.780
No.

1739
01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:50.530
Then what do you want?

1740
01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:54.420
I want to try to do something.

1741
01:43:58.770 --> 01:44:01.890
All the things...

1742
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:03.610
When I was a kid...

1743
01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:09.090
The booze...

1744
01:44:09.110 --> 01:44:10.760
And the men.

1745
01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:13.750
What happened to me.

1746
01:44:13.770 --> 01:44:15.850
When you weren't looking.

1747
01:44:19.890 --> 01:44:22.300
I know we're all weak.

1748
01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:23.710
Oh, not you...

1749
01:44:23.730 --> 01:44:26.320
No, I've been weak.

1750
01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:29.980
Well...

1751
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.830
Here's the thing.

1752
01:44:36.180 --> 01:44:38.060
I forgive you.

1753
01:44:55.710 --> 01:44:57.550
Oh...

1754
01:45:13.460 --> 01:45:15.060
I don't like your hair...

1755
01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:17.640
I know. I'm not
putting it back.

1756
01:45:22.060 --> 01:45:24.660
So, I'd like to
see you sometimes.

1757
01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:26.180
Is that ok?

1758
01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:30.280
Yes.

1759
01:45:31.870 --> 01:45:33.230
You can't live with me?

1760
01:45:33.250 --> 01:45:34.250
No.

1761
01:45:36.290 --> 01:45:37.770
I wouldn't want to.

1762
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:38.790
Ha ha.

1763
01:45:41.130 --> 01:45:43.380
Can I see him?

1764
01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:45.460
Not drunk.

1765
01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:46.460
You gotta be sober,

1766
01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:47.960
Even if it's just for 2 hours.

1767
01:45:47.980 --> 01:45:49.680
Yeah, I can do that.

1768
01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:50.700
Ok.

1769
01:45:55.490 --> 01:45:57.140
Well, then I'll
come and find you.

1770
01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:58.160
Ok?

1771
01:45:59.550 --> 01:46:01.620
Yeah.

1772
01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:03.660
Ok.

1773
01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:05.840
Why'd you do this, arley?

1774
01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:15.260
So, she told me why.

1775
01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:20.410
She told me I had
to do something big...

1776
01:46:20.430 --> 01:46:22.490
For 3 other people.

1777
01:46:22.510 --> 01:46:25.870

1778
01:46:25.890 --> 01:46:30.170

He can't tell you
what he wished for,

1782
01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:49.930
Or it won't come true.

1783
01:46:49.950 --> 01:46:52.630
Can I have some napkins?

1784
01:46:52.650 --> 01:46:54.640
Who wants a big...
where's my knife?

1785
01:46:57.700 --> 01:46:58.980
I'll get it.

1786
01:47:05.610 --> 01:47:06.610
Mom?

1787
01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:09.800
Hello.

1788
01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:10.970
Hi. Mrs. Mckinney,
I'm chris chandler.

1789
01:47:10.990 --> 01:47:12.110
I'm a reporter. I was wondering.

1790
01:47:12.130 --> 01:47:13.220
If I could have
a moment of your time.

1791
01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:14.710
Why?

1792
01:47:14.730 --> 01:47:16.460
I don't have anything
to say about anything.

1793
01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:18.880
Please, I've already
spoken to your mother,

1794
01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:20.720
Which naturally
led me to you, so...

1795
01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:21.710
My mother?

1796
01:47:21.730 --> 01:47:22.710
She told me about.

1797
01:47:22.730 --> 01:47:23.860
The pay it forward idea.

1798
01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:24.910
And how you've helped her out,

1799
01:47:24.930 --> 01:47:26.000
And I'm doing a story about it.

1800
01:47:26.020 --> 01:47:27.450
No, no, you can't.
That's private.

1801
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:28.450
Ok, mrs. Mckinney...

1802
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:29.490
My son's upset about it.

1803
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:30.860
It was a social studies thing,

1804
01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:32.530
And it didn't work out
the way he wanted it to.

1805
01:47:32.550 --> 01:47:33.580
Social studies?

1806
01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:34.980
Yeah. Please
just leave it alone.

1807
01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.850
He just wants to get on
with the seventh grade.

1808
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:38.270
Seventh grade? How do you...

1809
01:47:38.290 --> 01:47:39.860
Plus it's his birthday party,
and it's a bad time, ok?

1810
01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:40.860
I'm sorry to...

1811
01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:42.830
No, I'm sorry, mrs. Mckinney.

1812
01:47:42.850 --> 01:47:43.830
I've been tracking this story.

1813
01:47:43.850 --> 01:47:45.500
From los angeles, ok?

1814
01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:47.170
Pay it forward, the movement...

1815
01:47:47.190 --> 01:47:48.680
It's reached I.A.,
mrs. Mckinney.

1816
01:47:48.700 --> 01:47:50.460
Come on, the movement?

1817
01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:51.870
Yeah. You're
telling me your son.

1818
01:47:51.890 --> 01:47:53.500
Had something to do with this?

1819
01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:55.200
Aah!

1820
01:47:55.220 --> 01:47:56.870
Aah!

1821
01:47:56.890 --> 01:47:58.860
Aah!

1822
01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:00.380
Aah!

1823
01:48:05.710 --> 01:48:07.580
We really appreciate
this, ms. Mckinney.

1824
01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:09.160
It's up to him.

1825
01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:10.700
Good.

1826
01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:12.040
Ready, slugger?

1827
01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:13.170
I guess.

1828
01:48:13.190 --> 01:48:15.290
There you go.
Up here, please, sir.

1829
01:48:15.310 --> 01:48:17.550
Just like you're
getting a haircut.

1830
01:48:17.570 --> 01:48:19.600
You ever been
interviewed before?

1831
01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:21.020
No.

1832
01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:23.560
Hey, trevor.

1833
01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:25.090
This is for you.

1834
01:48:25.110 --> 01:48:26.680
Hi. How are you?

1835
01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:27.720
What's your name?

1836
01:48:27.740 --> 01:48:30.050
Chris chandler.
Nice to meet you.

1837
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:31.640
A little less painful
than a trip to the dentist.

1838
01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:33.340
You're gonna be great.
Just be yourself, ok, pal?

1839
01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:34.450
Ok. You ready to go?

1840
01:48:34.470 --> 01:48:35.620
I guess. You guess?

1841
01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:37.400
Come on, you gotta
have some gusto here.

1842
01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:38.570
Are we ready?

1843
01:48:38.590 --> 01:48:40.120
All right, let's go.
All right, great.

1844
01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:43.080
Ok, now, just be
yourself. Relax.

1845
01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:45.420
It's gonna be a lot of fun, ok?

1846
01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:46.440
All right.

1847
01:48:50.910 --> 01:48:53.650
Ok, we're on?

1848
01:48:53.670 --> 01:48:56.190
Hi, I'm chris chandler,
and I'm joined today.

1849
01:48:56.210 --> 01:48:58.190
By a very unusual
seventh grader,

1850
01:48:58.210 --> 01:49:00.750
Trevor mckinney.

1851
01:49:00.770 --> 01:49:02.120
Trevor, you must be.

1852
01:49:02.140 --> 01:49:03.420
Pretty proud of yourself.

1853
01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:04.790
No.

1854
01:49:04.810 --> 01:49:07.590
So you're not proud at all?

1855
01:49:07.610 --> 01:49:11.800
I don't know. I guess.

1856
01:49:11.820 --> 01:49:13.810
Come on, you start a movement.

1857
01:49:13.830 --> 01:49:15.730
Like pay it forward.
You're not proud?

1858
01:49:15.750 --> 01:49:20.070
I guess. I mean, I got
an "a" in social studies,

1859
01:49:20.090 --> 01:49:23.020
But that was
just for the effort.

1860
01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:26.160
I mean, the stuff I did
didn't really work out.

1861
01:49:27.220 --> 01:49:28.650
You're here.

1862
01:49:28.670 --> 01:49:29.740
Yeah, but...

1863
01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:32.120
I don't know.
I tried real hard,

1864
01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:36.330
But nothing really happened.

1865
01:49:36.350 --> 01:49:38.340
My mom's stuff worked.

1866
01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:39.650
She talked to my grandma,

1867
01:49:39.670 --> 01:49:41.490
Kind of made up with her,

1868
01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:43.700
And it was really hard for her.

1869
01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:45.270
It was great for me,

1870
01:49:45.290 --> 01:49:48.070
Because my grandma came
to my birthday party,

1871
01:49:48.090 --> 01:49:52.210
And I had really missed her.

1872
01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:55.000
And that's why pay it forward.

1873
01:49:55.020 --> 01:49:56.870
Went to all those places...

1874
01:49:56.890 --> 01:49:58.630
'cause of my mom.

1875
01:49:58.650 --> 01:50:03.080
'Cause she was so brave.

1876
01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:04.940
My stuff, I... I don't know.

1877
01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:07.980
I think some people are
too scared or something.

1878
01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.580
I think things
can be different...

1879
01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:13.900
And, I mean, the world's...

1880
01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:17.660
The world's not exactly...

1881
01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:19.650
Shit.

1882
01:50:21.670 --> 01:50:24.170
But I guess it's hard
for some people.

1883
01:50:24.190 --> 01:50:26.900
Who are so used to things
the way they are...

1884
01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:29.870
Even if they're bad...

1885
01:50:29.890 --> 01:50:33.360
To change...

1886
01:50:33.380 --> 01:50:36.600
And they kind of give up.

1887
01:50:40.780 --> 01:50:44.730
When they do,
everybody kind of...

1888
01:50:44.750 --> 01:50:46.450
Kind of loses.

1889
01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:15.260
Arlene...

1890
01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:19.550
I don't want to be
one of those people.

1891
01:51:19.570 --> 01:51:21.750
He's talking about,

1892
01:51:21.770 --> 01:51:23.910
And I've become one.

1893
01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:28.260
I don't want to spend.

1894
01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:29.700
Another second of wasted air.

1895
01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:36.110
Please don't let me stay
trapped in here forever.

1896
01:51:36.130 --> 01:51:37.330
I won't.

1897
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:38.330
I don't want to spend.

1898
01:51:38.350 --> 01:51:39.970
Another second without you.

1899
01:51:50.660 --> 01:51:53.850
Girl: Trevor, that was awesome.

1900
01:51:53.870 --> 01:51:55.680
See you later, guys.

1901
01:51:55.700 --> 01:51:56.690
Boy: Tomorrow, right?

1902
01:51:56.710 --> 01:51:57.910
Bye, man.

1903
01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:02.180
Let me go! Stop it!

1904
01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:03.100
Who'd you tell?

1905
01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:04.270
Stop it!

1906
01:52:04.290 --> 01:52:05.770
Who'd you tell, tattletale?

1907
01:52:05.790 --> 01:52:07.610
I didn't tell anybody.

1908
01:52:07.630 --> 01:52:09.230
Ah, ah, ah!

1909
01:52:09.250 --> 01:52:12.650
I swear I didn't say anything!

1910
01:52:12.670 --> 01:52:13.740
Help!

1911
01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:19.050
Let me go. Stop it.

1912
01:52:19.070 --> 01:52:20.070
Trevor!

1913
01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:26.030
Come here.

1914
01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:31.420
Eugene: Hey! Let me go!

1915
01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:32.890
Trevor!

1916
01:52:32.910 --> 01:52:36.230
No, trevor! Hey!

1917
01:52:36.250 --> 01:52:37.680
Get out of my face!

1918
01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:38.700
Punch him. Come on!

1919
01:52:39.860 --> 01:52:40.910
No!

1920
01:52:41.890 --> 01:52:43.190
Eugene: Leave him alone!

1921
01:52:43.210 --> 01:52:44.330
Trevor!

1922
01:52:44.350 --> 01:52:45.780
Trevor?

1923
01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:47.470
Unh!

1924
01:52:51.930 --> 01:52:53.400
Trevor?!

1925
01:53:04.970 --> 01:53:07.250
Someone get an ambulance!

1926
01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:05.800
Trevor: But I guess it's hard
for some people who are...

1927
01:54:05.820 --> 01:54:08.050
So used to things
the way they are...

1928
01:54:08.070 --> 01:54:12.150
Even if they're bad...
to change...

1929
01:54:12.170 --> 01:54:14.480
Because...

1930
01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:17.410
I guess they kinda give up.

1931
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:21.500
And when they do...

1932
01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:25.020
Everybody kinda loses.

1933
01:54:26.110 --> 01:54:28.010
Newsman: These moments
make you sorry.

1934
01:54:28.030 --> 01:54:30.010
To have to report
anything at all.

1935
01:54:30.030 --> 01:54:32.520
This remarkable young man
died at 7:35 this evening.

1936
01:54:32.540 --> 01:54:34.520
Newswoman: There are
now confirmed incidents.

1937
01:54:34.540 --> 01:54:36.020
Of pay it forward.

1938
01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:37.530
In los angeles, san francisco.

1939
01:54:37.550 --> 01:54:39.530
And in phoenix,
we're checking to see.

1940
01:54:39.550 --> 01:54:41.540
If the 16 foster children.

1941
01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:43.210
Who just received computers.

1942
01:54:43.230 --> 01:54:45.380
Is in any way connected
to this movement.

1943
01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:48.400
Trevor: It's hard.
You can't plan it.

1944
01:54:49.900 --> 01:54:52.890
You have to watch people
more, you know,

1945
01:54:52.910 --> 01:54:55.060
Sort of...

1946
01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:57.070
Sort of keep an eye on 'em.

1947
01:54:57.090 --> 01:55:00.570
To protect 'em, because...

1948
01:55:00.590 --> 01:55:03.140
They can't always
see what they need.

1949
01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:08.220
It's... it's like your big chance.

1950
01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:10.360
To fix something
that's not like your bike.

1951
01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:20.080
You can... Fix a person.

1952
01:55:20.100 --> 01:55:22.580
Chris: Is that what
you want for your birthday,

1953
01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:24.580
Everybody to pay it forward?

1954
01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:26.290
I can't ask for that.

1955
01:55:26.310 --> 01:55:28.590
Sure, you can. Why not?

1956
01:55:28.610 --> 01:55:29.760
Wouldn't work.

1957
01:55:29.780 --> 01:55:31.370
Why?

1958
01:55:38.380 --> 01:55:41.000
I already blew out my candles.
