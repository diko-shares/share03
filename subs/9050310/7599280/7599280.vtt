00:14:56.268 --> 00:14:58.730
Are your guys's parents
going to the dance tonight?

183
00:14:58.765 --> 00:15:00.501
Everyone's parents are going.

184
00:15:00.536 --> 00:15:03.471
All the parents will go
and get pissy-drunk

185
00:15:03.506 --> 00:15:06.144
and then come home and
we'll have to deal with them.

186
00:15:06.179 --> 00:15:08.080
My Dad's scary when he's drunk.

187
00:15:08.115 --> 00:15:09.983
Yeah, welcome to Crap Hole.

188
00:15:10.018 --> 00:15:12.480
Population, who cares?

189
00:15:12.515 --> 00:15:13.910
Pang?

190
00:15:13.945 --> 00:15:16.253
What other crap hole are you
living in?

191
00:15:16.288 --> 00:15:18.321
I think Pang is awesome.

192
00:15:18.356 --> 00:15:20.620
Sorry you like crap so much.

193
00:15:20.655 --> 00:15:22.996
Maybe it's just crap
wherever you go.

194
00:15:23.031 --> 00:15:26.692
Whatever, everywhere in Pang
is ghetto.

195
00:15:26.727 --> 00:15:29.299
So ghetto.

196
00:15:29.334 --> 00:15:31.301
Maika: I'm gonna move to
Winnipeg and forget about

197
00:15:31.336 --> 00:15:33.369
all these lame Inuk problems.

198
00:15:33.404 --> 00:15:36.372
This chick gets to go to
Winnipeg every year.

199
00:15:36.407 --> 00:15:38.407
I know. Lucky.

200
00:15:59.265 --> 00:16:01.298
Leena: Thomassie Tiktak
just got a Honda.

201
00:16:01.333 --> 00:16:02.893
It's a nice one.

202
00:16:02.928 --> 00:16:05.863
How do you know?
He take you for a ride on it?

203
00:16:05.898 --> 00:16:09.141
Not even! I'm just saying.

204
00:16:09.176 --> 00:16:11.440
Those things are sketchy
as hell, I'd never get on one.

205
00:16:19.417 --> 00:16:21.879
Bet you can't shoot that can.

206
00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:23.815
I could, easy.

207
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:26.818
My Dad taught me shooting.

208
00:16:26.853 --> 00:16:30.459
He can shoot seal when they're
just tiny dots way off.

209
00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.700
- Thought so.
- Shut up!

210
00:16:40.735 --> 00:16:43.076
- Let me shoot, then.
- As if.

211
00:16:43.111 --> 00:16:44.902
Don't be such a wimp about it.

212
00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:47.245
Look, I don't got all the
bullets in the world

213
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.005
for you to be blasting off
everywhere.

214
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.040
Yeah, little miss John McClane.

215
00:16:51.075 --> 00:16:52.778
Who's that, Manitok's cousin?

216

- (camera lens shuttering)
- Hey. Hey!

218
00:16:57.983 --> 00:16:59.862
Uki: It's not fair
that other people can't shoot

219
00:16:59.886 --> 00:17:01.259
'cause you're a chicken.

220
00:17:01.294 --> 00:17:03.888
Uh, my gun means I decide
what's fair.

221
00:17:05.892 --> 00:17:07.496
It's coming closer!

222
00:17:10.336 --> 00:17:11.665
You guys!

223
00:17:18.674 --> 00:17:20.443
Leena:
What is it?

224
00:17:20.478 --> 00:17:22.038
- Maika: I don't know!
- What is it?!

225
00:17:22.073 --> 00:17:23.875
Shh! It's a bear.

226
00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:26.251
Bear?! Oh God, our parents are
going to kill me!

227
00:17:26.286 --> 00:17:27.912
Shh, just stay still.

Maika:

236
00:17:55.777 --> 00:17:57.150
Run! Maika!

237
00:17:57.185 --> 00:17:58.910
Okay, come on!

238
00:17:58.945 --> 00:18:00.483
Maika:

Come on, guys! Come on!

Shoot it now!

Aju, run!

Shoot! Shoot it!

00:18:22.375 --> 00:18:23.506
Hurry!

248
00:18:23.541 --> 00:18:25.068

Wake up, Aju!

Oh my God.

255
00:18:47.268 --> 00:18:48.729
Come on, come one.

256
00:18:48.764 --> 00:18:50.060
Let's get out of here.

257
00:18:50.095 --> 00:18:51.402
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

258
00:18:51.437 --> 00:18:53.371
- Come on.
- What was that?

259
00:18:55.936 --> 00:18:58.673
That was so scary,
I thought you were dead.

260
00:18:58.708 --> 00:19:00.246
Aju, are you hurt?

261
00:19:10.852 --> 00:19:12.819
(growling)

Wash this gunk off.

Aju:
It's not coming off.

265
00:19:31.543 --> 00:19:33.939
See how it moved?
It didn't move right.

266
00:19:33.974 --> 00:19:35.842
And its blood was black.

267
00:19:35.877 --> 00:19:38.845
And its face was messed!
Like, dead.

268
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.177
Maybe it was just effed up with
rabies or something.

269
00:19:41.212 --> 00:19:44.290
Uh-uh, that's not what effed up
with rabies looks like.

270
00:19:44.325 --> 00:19:47.293
That's not even what a bear
looks like.

271
00:19:52.465 --> 00:19:54.465
(ominous music)

273

It's just a bunch of blurs!

278

It's a crazy bear thing.
It grabbed Aju.

- What?
- It ran away with me.

280

Get out of here.

281
00:20:51.524 --> 00:20:53.183

down there.

- I shot it first.
- Yeah.

That's why it came after us in
the first place. Doy.

Thomassie:
Sounds cray.

287
00:21:08.508 --> 00:21:11.344
Totally cray. Cray-cray.

288
00:21:11.379 --> 00:21:13.643
But like, what was it?

289
00:21:15.581 --> 00:21:17.273
Ijiraq.

290
00:21:17.308 --> 00:21:18.648
Ijiraq tried to take me?

291
00:21:18.683 --> 00:21:20.881
It was not Ijiraq. Don't even.

292
00:21:20.916 --> 00:21:22.278
What was it then?

293
00:21:22.313 --> 00:21:24.181
It was just an effed up bear.

294
00:21:24.216 --> 00:21:25.853
What makes an Ijiraq?

295
00:21:25.888 --> 00:21:27.525
Shape-shifting,
children stealing.

296
00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.823
What did this thing do?

297
00:21:28.858 --> 00:21:30.462
Pretend to be a bear
and steal Aju.

298
00:21:30.497 --> 00:21:32.365
Ijiraq.

299
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.796
That's Inuk nonsense.

300
00:21:34.831 --> 00:21:38.228
There's no Ijiraq, no Sedna,
and no Qalupalik.

301
00:21:38.263 --> 00:21:40.670
Just stupid old people
stories made up

302

internet yet.

303
00:21:43.334 --> 00:21:45.169
What's an Ijiraq?

304
00:21:45.204 --> 00:21:48.744
Ijiraq are things that live
in two worlds.

305
00:21:48.779 --> 00:21:50.581
Two worlds?

306
00:21:50.616 --> 00:21:53.045
If you go far enough north,
there's a whole other world.

307
00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:56.422
If you go far enough north,
you'll start going south.

308
00:21:58.624 --> 00:22:00.492
When Ijiraq comes to our world,

309
00:22:00.527 --> 00:22:02.890
they can disguise themselves
as anything,

310
00:22:02.925 --> 00:22:04.859
and when they do,
they snatch children

311
00:22:04.894 --> 00:22:06.256
and bring them back
to their world.

312
00:22:06.291 --> 00:22:07.895
Why do they take children?

313
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:11.833
'Cause it makes no sense,
it's dumb Inuk stuff.

314
00:22:11.868 --> 00:22:14.572
And only dumb Inuit
fall for it now.

315
00:22:14.607 --> 00:22:16.420
You think you know all that,
but it's only people

316
00:22:16.444 --> 00:22:20.006
who think they know all that who
really don't know anything.

317
00:22:20.041 --> 00:22:21.843
Ask your At a at a, he'll tell you.

Feel free to shut up
about my dad.

320
00:22:27.114 --> 00:22:29.884
Hey, since you know so much

321
00:22:29.919 --> 00:22:31.886
and you're such a good little
Inuk anyway,

322
00:22:31.921 --> 00:22:33.888
why don't you go out there and
hunt that thing

323
00:22:33.923 --> 00:22:36.429
with all your great skills?

324
00:22:36.464 --> 00:22:40.466
Then you can come back and prove
us all wrong.

325
00:22:40.501 --> 00:22:42.831
Seriously, I dare you.
Go out there.

Who's smoking what out here?!

327
00:22:46.837 --> 00:22:48.870
Huh?

328
00:22:48.905 --> 00:22:50.509
Tiktak.

329
00:22:53.239 --> 00:22:55.272
Some big wheels you got.

330

Aww, don't give me that
stoic stare.

333
00:23:05.988 --> 00:23:09.418
I might lose myself
in those dreamy eyes.

Lefebvre, leave the kids alone.

have his helmet.

Lefebvre, just go.

That's an order.

339
00:23:43.025 --> 00:23:45.289
Hey, so what are you doing
later?

340
00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.470
I'm having a few people over,
you should come by.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.827
- Hi, At a at a.
- Hi.

359
00:26:00.261 --> 00:26:01.766
Around.

360
00:26:01.801 --> 00:26:04.197
So your thing is you don't want
An a an a to go out?

361
00:26:06.597 --> 00:26:09.466
We were coming home, but this
real doy, Johnny Lampe,

362
00:26:09.501 --> 00:26:11.600
was making trouble for
all the kids,

363
00:26:11.635 --> 00:26:13.404
but Maika got him to stop,

364
00:26:13.439 --> 00:26:15.912
and because he's scared of
Maika, he stopped.

365
00:26:15.947 --> 00:26:18.442
Tanya: Oh, wow,
isn't that great of Maika.

366
00:26:18.477 --> 00:26:21.819
Why don't you tell Maika she is
supposed to be helping An a an a

367
00:26:21.854 --> 00:26:24.349
before she goes off helping
everybody in Pang?

368

Sorry. Hey, you and you.

stretchy pants went missing

was because you pooped yourself
on Shooyook's trampoline

717

Well, he's a creepy little guy
with long skinny fingers,

718
00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:34.082
and he runs around the North.
And you know what he does?

719
00:52:34.117 --> 00:52:35.655
Little kids:
What?

720
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:37.723
He... tickles people
until they die

Five.

725

- Alashua: Yep.

726

next year.

in your grade?

I think Peters is out there.

733
00:53:05.148 --> 00:53:07.324

I would only go because we have

769
00:55:07.776 --> 00:55:11.910
Okay, so first, what do we know
about these...

770
00:55:11.945 --> 00:55:13.747
Skins, I've been calling
them Skins.

771
00:55:13.782 --> 00:55:15.419
Cool.

772
00:55:15.454 --> 00:55:18.180
So we know they can, like,
smell their own blood,

773
00:55:18.215 --> 00:55:20.149
and noodles come out of
their hands,

774
00:55:20.184 --> 00:55:22.184
and claws come out of
the noodles.

775
00:55:22.219 --> 00:55:24.054
Which are super sharp,
and they suck up blood

776
00:55:24.089 --> 00:55:26.661
to use as fuel for their
liver ship.

777
00:55:26.696 --> 00:55:29.059
Maybe they also need blood
for their own power?

778
00:55:29.094 --> 00:55:32.062
They might want our blood too.

779
00:55:32.097 --> 00:55:34.405
So they're just horny for blood?

780
00:55:35.804 --> 00:55:37.265
How'd you kill the little one?

781
00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:41.170
Oh, I cut open it's throat
with an ulu.

782
00:55:41.205 --> 00:55:42.842
Nasty.

783
00:55:42.877 --> 00:55:45.273
I love it.

784
00:55:45.308 --> 00:55:49.684
They do that weird walk until
they get close.

785
00:55:49.719 --> 00:55:52.423
That's why they wear skins!
To try and get close.

786
00:55:52.458 --> 00:55:54.590
Dummies, think they're tricky.

787
00:55:54.625 --> 00:55:57.791
And then they run really fast
and really strong.

788
00:55:57.826 --> 00:55:59.859
But I think they get tired.

789
00:55:59.894 --> 00:56:01.443
Like, maybe if they don't have
enough blood,

790
00:56:01.467 --> 00:56:04.567
they can only be fast and strong
for short bits.

791
00:56:12.577 --> 00:56:14.104
They must be strong by now,

792
00:56:14.139 --> 00:56:16.909
they probably just sucked up all
of Peter's blood.

793
00:56:18.913 --> 00:56:21.309
Girl, you know a lot.

794
00:56:21.344 --> 00:56:23.113
My Dad always told me
you have to observe

795
00:56:23.148 --> 00:56:25.753
what you're going to hunt
to understand how to hunt it.

796
00:56:25.788 --> 00:56:27.722
We're gonna hunt them?

797
00:56:27.757 --> 00:56:32.661
They came here to hunt us,
but what they don't know

798
00:56:32.696 --> 00:56:35.664
is that we're the best
hunters there is.

799
00:56:44.543 --> 00:56:48.105
We're going out for a bit.
Aju, stay here, okay?

800

No, I don't.

trying to get us

808
00:57:06.961 --> 00:57:09.962

Yeah, it was more just freaky.

898
01:04:02.706 --> 01:04:05.740
That's two for Uki, which makes
the meanest alien killer

899
01:04:05.775 --> 01:04:07.544
in the North, by far.

900

who we are.

The other one could come
at any second,

903
01:04:12.452 --> 01:04:14.221
and it's got no injuries.

904
01:04:14.256 --> 01:04:16.355
This trap we're going to set
is really chancy

905
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:17.686
because it requires bait,

906
01:04:17.721 --> 01:04:20.194
which I'm going to be.

907
01:04:20.229 --> 01:04:23.428

responsible for me not dying.

saying you're bait.

be on "To Catch A Predator."

913
01:04:32.769 --> 01:04:34.945
They're always using bait on
those old pervos.

914
01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:36.771
- That show's the best.
- So what?

915
01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:40.148

- No doy. I'm volunteering.

916
01:04:40.183 --> 01:04:42.315

cool person,

917
01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:45.549

like being a mean alien killer,

918
01:04:45.584 --> 01:04:46.957

born as.
