Now, I had requested light armor
and AC-130 Spectre gunships,

348
00:24:03.651 --> 00:24:07.315
but Washington, in all its wisdom,
decided against this.

349
00:24:07.905 --> 00:24:09.691
Too high-profile.

350
00:24:09.907 --> 00:24:13.150
So Black Hawks and Little Birds
will provide the air cover

351
00:24:13.243 --> 00:24:15.450

Exactly which building,
we're confirming right now.

360
00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.846
Somewhere around the Bakara Market.

of their meetings.

Now we'll be going through friendly
neighborhoods before we hit the market,

367
00:25:00.916 --> 00:25:02.532

before I got here...

1878
02:20:45.020 --> 02:20:47.261
It was when we were all shipping out.

1879
02:20:47.356 --> 02:20:48.721
He asked me,

1880
02:20:50.275 --> 02:20:53.393
"Why are you going to fight
somebody else's war?"

1881
02:20:53.779 --> 02:20:56.396
"What, do y'all think you're heroes?"

1882
02:20:59.076 --> 02:21:01.864
I didn't know what to say at the time,

1883
02:21:04.414 --> 02:21:06.997
but if he asked me again, I'd say, "No."

1884
02:21:09.461 --> 02:21:11.793
I'd say, "There's no way in hell."

1885
02:21:12.673 --> 02:21:14.710
Nobody asks to be a hero.

1886
02:21:19.763 --> 02:21:22.050
It just sometimes turns out that way.

1887
02:21:26.144 --> 02:21:29.603
I'm gonna talk to your ma and pa
when I get home, okay?

RUIZ: <i>My love, you are strong
and you will do well in life.</i>

1890
02:22:42.220 --> 02:22:44.678
<i>I love you and my children deeply.</i>

1891
02:22:45.599 --> 02:22:48.808
<i>Today and tomorrow,
let each day grow and grow.</i>

1892
02:22:50.228 --> 02:22:54.392
<i>Keep smiling and never give up,
even when things get you down.</i>

1893
02:22:55.817 --> 02:22:58.275
<i>So, in closing, my love,</i>

1894
02:22:58.361 --> 02:23:02.275
<i>tonight, tuck my children in bed warmly.</i>

1895
02:23:02.866 --> 02:23:04.197
<i>Tell them I love them.</i>

1896
02:23:04.284 --> 02:23:07.117
<i>Then hug them for me,</i>

1897
02:23:07.621 --> 02:23:09.953
<i>and give them both
a kiss good night for Daddy.</i>

1902

02:25:12.996 --> 02:25:16.910
<i>His father's sword</i>

1904
02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:20.994
<i>He's girded on</i>

1905
02:25:21.087 --> 02:25:25.206
<i>And his wild harp slung</i>

1906
02:25:25.300 --> 02:25:29.510
<i>His wild harp slung behind him</i>

<i>Thy right shall guard</i>

1913
02:25:53.828 --> 02:25:58.322
<i>One faithful harp</i>

1914
02:25:58.416 --> 02:26:02.660
<i>Shall praise thee</i>

1915
02:26:35.287 --> 02:26:39.702
