1
00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:35.757
There.

2
00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:37.968
Technicals, nine o'clock.

3
00:04:03.452 --> 00:04:05.162
Oh, shit! Did you see that?

4
00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:09.458
Chief, we got unarmed civilians
getting shot down here at nine o'clock.

5
00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:12.836
I got it, Matt.
I don't think we can touch this.

6
00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:22.262
Command, Super 64...

7
00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:26.057
...we got militia shooting civilians
at the food distribution center.

8
00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:28.393
Request permission to engage.

9
00:04:28.477 --> 00:04:30.812
Super 64, are you taking fire? Over.

10
00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:32.814
Negative, command.

11
00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:36.568
U.N.'s jurisdiction, 64.
We cannot intervene.

12
00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:38.361
-Return to base. Over.
-Roger.

13
00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.697
64 returning.

14
00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:42.551
Leaving.

15
00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:49.409
General Garrison?

16
00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:50.827
No, thanks. I got one.

17
00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:52.829
But these are Cuban.

18
00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:55.040
Bolivar Belicoso.

19
00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:56.499
So is this.

20
00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.004
Miami, my friend, is not Cuba.

21
00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:11.514
I see not catching Aidid
IS becoming a routine.

22
00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:15.393
We weren't trying to catch Aidid.
We were trying to catch you.

23
00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:16.311
Me?

24
00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:18.772
But am I that important?

25
00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:20.732
I hardly think so.

26
00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:23.944
-You're just a businessman.
-Trying to make a living.

27
00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:26.863
Yeah. Selling guns to Aidid's militia.

28
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.411
You've been here, what?

29
00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:36.539
Six weeks?

30
00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:41.795
Six weeks
you are trying to catch the general.

31
00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:44.506
You put up reward posters.

32
00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:49.260
$25,000. What is this?
Gunfight at the K.O. Corral?

33
00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:53.515
It's the O.K. Corral.

34
00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:58.186
Do you think bringing me in
will make him suddenly come to you?

35
00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:00.563
Make him more agreeable?

36
00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:05.151
You know where he sleeps.

37
00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:09.239
You pay for his beds, much less his militia.

38
00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:14.119
We're not leaving Somalia till we find him.

39
00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:16.955
And we will find him.

40
00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:19.666
Don't think because I grew up
without running water...

41
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:21.751
... am simple, General.

42
00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:25.130
I do know something about history.

43
00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:30.135
See all this? It's simply shaping tomorrow.

44
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.764
A tomorrow without a lot
of Arkansas white boys' ideas in it.

45
00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:38.351
Well, I wouldn't know about that.
I'm from Texas.

46
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.689
Mr. Garrison,
I think you shouldn't have come here.

47
00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:45.191
This is civil war.

48
00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:47.986
This is our war.

49
00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:49.988
Not yours.

50
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.492
300,000 dead and counting.

51
00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:58.079
That's not a war, Mr. Atto.
That's genocide.

52
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:02.167
Now, you enjoy that tea, you hear?

53
00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:09.632
How'd he strike you?

54
00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:12.886
Urbane, sophisticated, cruel.

55
00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:14.721
Yeah, he's a good catch.

56
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.557
It'll take time, but Aidid will feel the loss.

57
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.477
I'm not sure time is something we got
in great supply.

58
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.731
This isn't Iraq, you know.
Much more complicated than that.

59
00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:27.150
Boss, most of Washington might disagree.

60
00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:31.404
They've been calling for situation reports
every morning this week.

61
00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:36.826
Well, tell them the situation is fragile.

62
00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:46.002
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Cliff "Elvis" Wolcott.

63
00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:47.837
I'll be your pilot today.

64
00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:52.008
Federal regulations designate this
a non-smoking Black Hawk helicopter.

65
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:56.387
Those in Mogadishu frequent flyer program
will earn 100 free credits.

66
00:09:56.596 --> 00:10:01.142
And as always, the air sickness bags
are in the seat back in front of you.

67
00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:05.021
Number one indications are good, Cliff.
Put her on two.

68
00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:06.523
You're still clear.

69
00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:25.041
61, this is 64. Go to UHF secure.

70
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.417
I've got some bad news.

71
00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:30.338
"Limo" is a word, Durant.
I don't want to hear about it.

72
00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:33.258
It is not a word.
It's an abbreviation of a word.

73
00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:35.426
"Limo" is a word in common usage.

74
00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:39.305
That is the key phrase in Scrabble,
my good friend. Common usage.

75
00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:42.475
If it's not in the dictionary it doesn't count!

76
00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:44.644
It doesn't have to be in the dictionary!

77
00:10:44.727 --> 00:10:46.896
It does have to be in the dictionary!

78
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.275
When we get back to the base,
it's coming off.

79
00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:53.987
You touch my "limo”
and I'll spank you, Night stalker.

80
00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:56.197
Yeah, promises.

81
00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:58.700
That's a nice beach down there.

82
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.451
How's the water?

83
00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:04.831
Yeah, it's nice and warm.
And it's loaded with sharks.

84
00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:12.505
-Name.
-Todd.

85
00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:14.632
-Last name.
-Blackburn.

86
00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:18.136
First name, Todd.

87
00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:21.264
-So, what's it like?
-What's what like?

88
00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:22.724
Mogadishu. The fighting.

89
00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:26.728
-Serial number.
-72163427.

90
00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:31.608
Firstly, it's "the Mog" or simply "Mog."
No one calls it Mogadishu here.

91
00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:35.069
Secondly, I wouldn't know
about the fighting, so don't ask.

92
00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:36.654
Why not?

93
00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:38.781
Didn't I just say, "Don't ask"?

94
00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:44.954
You look like you're about 12,
so let me explain something to you.

95
00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:48.625
I have a rare and mysterious skill
that precludes me from doing missions.

96
00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:51.044
Typing.

97
00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:53.546
-Can you type?
-No.

98
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:58.009
-Date of birth.
-2-27-75.

99
00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:05.850
Well, I'm here to kick some ass.

100
00:12:10.688 --> 00:12:12.148
Let's bring it in.

101
00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.582
Nice, man! Very smooth!

102
00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:31.834
Single shot through the engine block.

103
00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:35.213
Shit, that's a shame. That was a nice jeep.

104
00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:01.281
Cease fire! Cease fire!

105
00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:02.991
Check your weapons!

106
00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:04.200
Sergeant Eversmann.

107
00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:10.039
Private First Class Blackburn.

108
00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:11.374
Yeah?

109
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.042
Reporting for duty.

110
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:18.047
Not to me. You're reporting to Lt. Beales.
He should be here somewhere.

111
00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:19.382
Can I leave him with you?

112
00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:22.385
Yeah, go ahead.

113
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.679
-You brought your weapon.
-Yes, sir.

114
00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:26.806
Want me to shoot? I'm rested.

115
00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.059
-When did you get in?
-Just now, Sergeant.

116
00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:36.065
Hey, who's hungry?

117
00:13:58.588 --> 00:14:01.924
What is this, Sarg'nt?
Another taxpayer-funded Delta safari?

118
00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:05.219
-Not if General Garrison is asking.
-I'm asking.

119
00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:07.597
Have a nice meal, Captain.

120
00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:14.729
-Hey, man, there's a line.
- know.

121
00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:18.566
-Well, this isn't the back of it.
-Yeah, I know.

122
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:22.111
Sergeant. Sergeant.

123
00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:23.988
What's going on here?

124
00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:27.116
Some aerial target practice, sir.
Didn't want to leave it behind.

125
00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:29.327
I'm talking about your weapon.

126
00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:32.038
Delta or no Delta, that's a hot weapon.

127
00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:35.500
You know better than that.
Safety should be on at all times on base.

128
00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:37.960
Well, this is my safety, sir.

129
00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:43.716
Let it go, sir.
The guy hasn't eaten in a couple of days.

130
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.636
You Delta boys
are a bunch of undisciplined cowboys.

131
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.305
Let me tell you something, Sarg'nt.

132
00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:53.309
When we get on a five-yard line,
you're going to need my Rangers.

133
00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:55.436
Y'all better learn to be team players.

134
00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:58.689
We're done here.

135
00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:11.828
Speak up. You say this is your safety?

136
00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:13.830
Well, this is my boot, son.

137
00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:18.084
And it will fit up your ass
with the proper amount of force.

138
00:15:18.292 --> 00:15:21.921
-Is that a Jersey accent?
-I'm trying to do this, give me a break.

139
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.006
Take those sunglasses off.

140
00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:26.467
Delta wants to wear Oakleys,
that's their business.

141
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:28.761
I don't want to see them on you again.

142
00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:32.223
Is that a hot weapon?

143
00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:38.938
Is that your move?

144
00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:40.982
Is my hand on the piece?

145
00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:43.776
I can mate you in three whatever you do.

146
00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:48.531
I'd keep my eye on that queen
before counseling others.

147
00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:51.159
Well, she's just lying in wait.

148
00:15:55.037 --> 00:15:56.038
Yikes.

149
00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:01.294
It's good. You're really improving.

150
00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:04.380
If I may make a suggestion-- Observation.

151
00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:05.590
Go ahead.

152
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.176
-It's a children's book, right?
-Right.

153
00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:12.889
They are not supposed to scare
the living shit out of the children.

154
00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:16.809
This is the part of the story
where our knight is slaying the dragon.

155
00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:19.562
That's scary.
Besides, my daughter loves this stuff.

156
00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:21.606
Thought you finished that last week.

157
00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:23.524
You done?

158
00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:28.571
Hey, we are at the 10-yard line here, men.

159
00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:30.239
You understand?

160
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.242
Can you count? One, two, ten.

161
00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:35.912
Okay? Where are my running backs?

162
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.914
Where are my running backs?

163
00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:42.585
Hey, I didn't see you at church on Sunday.

164
00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:44.712
You had something more important to do?

165
00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:47.340
Not on Sunday, you don't. Not anymore.

166
00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:49.717
I will make you believe, you understand?

167
00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:06.359
Pretty funny, hoo-ah?

168
00:17:09.403 --> 00:17:12.949
It was a good impression.
I recognize myself.

169
00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:17.203
All right, carry on.

170
00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:20.748
-I'd like a word, specialist.
-Sir.

171
00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:24.919
You understand why we have
a chain of command, don't you?

172
00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:25.962
Roger that, sir.

173
00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:29.549
If you ever undermine me again,
you'll clean latrines with your tongue...

174
00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:32.635
...till you taste no difference
between shit and French fries.

175
00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:33.844
-Are we clear?
-Hoo-ah, sir.

176
00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:34.845
All right.

177
00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:43.771
Listen to this:

178
00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:48.609
If one skinny kills another his clan owes
the dead guy's clan a hundred camels.

179
00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:50.152
A hundred camels.

180
00:17:50.361 --> 00:17:52.613
Camels. I wouldn't pay one camel.

181
00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:55.032
Must be a lot of fucking camel debt.

182
00:17:55.866 --> 00:17:57.743
Is that really true, Lieutenant?

183
00:17:57.952 --> 00:17:59.996
Ask Sgt. Eversmann. He likes skinnies.

184
00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:03.040
Sgt. Eversmann,
you really like the skinnies?

185
00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:07.211
It's not that I like them or I don't like them.
I respect them.

186
00:18:07.378 --> 00:18:11.549
See, what you guys fail to realize
Is the sergeant is a bit of an idealist.

187
00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:15.595
He believes in this mission
down to his bones. Don't you, Sergeant?

188
00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:19.098
Look, these people, they have no jobs...

189
00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:23.436
...no food, no education, no future.

190
00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:27.106
I just figure that, I mean,
we have two things that we can do.

191
00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:28.691
We can help...

192
00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:32.194
...or we can sit back and watch
the country destroy itself on CNN.

193
00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:33.279
Right?

194
00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:36.574
I don't know about you guys,
but I was trained to fight.

195
00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:38.868
Are you trained to fight, Sergeant?

196
00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:41.704
Well, I think I was trained
to make a difference, Kurth.

197
00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:45.249
Like the man said, he's an idealist.

198
00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:49.086
Oh, wait. This is my favorite part.

199
00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:56.510
Stay away from the cans!

200
00:18:56.719 --> 00:18:59.096
Die, gas-pumper!

201
00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:01.557
Stay away from those cans!

202
00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:08.606
No, no, stay back.

203
00:19:08.689 --> 00:19:11.692
He's having a seizure.
Put something in his mouth.

204
00:19:11.734 --> 00:19:16.697
John, it's okay. John, it's okay. It's okay.

205
00:20:03.077 --> 00:20:05.913
Well, he'll be fine. But not in this army.

206
00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:09.583
He's out of the game.
He's epileptic, going home.

207
00:20:14.088 --> 00:20:16.716
I'm putting you in charge of his chalk.

208
00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:19.969
-You got a problem with that?
-No, sir.

209
00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:22.138
It's a big responsibility.

210
00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:24.807
Your men will look to you
to make the right decisions.

211
00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:26.934
They're lives depend on it.

212
00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:29.228
All right.

213
00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:32.857
-Rangers lead the way, sir.
-All the way.

214
00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:34.483
Good luck.

215
00:21:18.027 --> 00:21:22.823
<i>A meeting of Aidid's senior cabinet
may take place today at 1500 hours.</i>

216
00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:26.368
I say "may" because we all know by now...

217
00:21:26.577 --> 00:21:29.872
...with the intel we get on the street,
nothing is certain.

218
00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:32.875
This is actual intel
confirmed by three sources.

219
00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:36.796
Two tier-one personalities may be present:

220
00:21:37.254 --> 00:21:41.300
Omar Salad, Aidid's top political advisor...

221
00:21:41.383 --> 00:21:43.969
...and Abdi Hassan Awale, interior minister.

222
00:21:44.053 --> 00:21:46.055
These are the guys we're after.

223
00:21:46.889 --> 00:21:48.265
Today we go.

224
00:21:48.849 --> 00:21:51.352
Same mission template as before.

225
00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:55.689
1545, Assault Force Delta
will infiltrate the target building...

226
00:21:55.898 --> 00:21:58.067
...and seize all suspects within.

227
00:21:58.275 --> 00:22:02.196
Security Force Rangers: 4 Ranger chalks,
under command of Capt. Steele...

228
00:22:02.238 --> 00:22:04.532
...will rope in at 1546...

229
00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:08.035
...and hold a four-corner perimeter
around the target building.

230
00:22:08.577 --> 00:22:09.912
No one gets in or out.

231
00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:11.705
Extraction Force:

232
00:22:11.997 --> 00:22:16.544
Lt. Colonel McKnight's humvee column
will drive in at 1547...

233
00:22:16.752 --> 00:22:20.673
...on Hawlwadig Road
and hold just short of the Olympic Hotel.

234
00:22:20.881 --> 00:22:22.341
Wait for the green light.

235
00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.426
Now once Delta gives the word...

236
00:22:24.635 --> 00:22:29.348
...McKnight's column will go to the target
and load the prisoners onto trucks.

237
00:22:29.932 --> 00:22:32.309
Immediately after
the prisoners are loaded...

238
00:22:32.476 --> 00:22:36.605
...the four Ranger chalks
will collapse back to the target building...

239
00:22:36.814 --> 00:22:38.190
...load up on humvees...

240
00:22:38.399 --> 00:22:42.278
...and the entire ground force
will exfil the 3 miles back to base.

241
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:45.781
Mission time, no longer than 30 minutes.

242
00:22:46.907 --> 00:22:51.745
Now, I had requested light armor
and AC-130 Spectre gunships...

243
00:22:51.954 --> 00:22:56.000
...but Washington, in all its wisdom,
decided against this.

244
00:22:56.208 --> 00:22:58.043
Too high-profile.

245
00:22:58.294 --> 00:23:01.463
So Black Hawks and Little Birds
will provide the air cover...

246
00:23:01.672 --> 00:23:03.883
...with miniguns and 2.75 rockets.

247
00:23:04.133 --> 00:23:05.467
Colonel Harrell.

248
00:23:05.676 --> 00:23:10.014
In the C-2 bird, Colonel Matthews
will coordinate the air mission...

249
00:23:10.514 --> 00:23:13.350
...and I will coordinate ground forces.

250
00:23:13.684 --> 00:23:14.977
Colonel Matthews.

251
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.355
Mission launch code word is Irene.

252
00:23:18.814 --> 00:23:19.815
Questions?

253
00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:24.403
Which building is it, sir?

254
00:23:24.945 --> 00:23:28.532
We're confirming that now.
Somewhere near the Bakara market.

255
00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.163
I don't choose the time or place
of their meetings.

256
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.165
I didn't say a word, sir.

257
00:23:36.457 --> 00:23:39.835
Make no mistake,
once you're in the Bakara market...

258
00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:42.338
...you're in an entirely hostile district.

259
00:23:42.838 --> 00:23:45.215
Don't underestimate their capabilities.

260
00:23:45.466 --> 00:23:49.053
We'll be in friendly neighborhoods
before we hit the market...

261
00:23:49.178 --> 00:23:53.891
...80 remember the rules of engagement:
No one fires unless fired upon.

262
00:23:54.058 --> 00:23:56.352
Now, let's go get this thing done.

263
00:23:57.436 --> 00:23:59.063
Good luck, gentlemen.

264
00:24:04.026 --> 00:24:06.946
What's the matter, Danny?
Something you don't like?

265
00:24:07.154 --> 00:24:09.365
No Spectre gunships,
daylight instead of night...

266
00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:12.034
...afternoon when they're all fucked up
on khat...

267
00:24:12.201 --> 00:24:16.372
...only part of the city Aidid can mount
a counter-attack on short notice....

268
00:24:16.705 --> 00:24:19.625
-What's not to like?
-Life's imperfect.

269
00:24:19.833 --> 00:24:23.545
For you two, circling above it at 500 feet,
it's imperfect.

270
00:24:23.796 --> 00:24:27.466
Down in the street, it's unforgiving.

271
00:25:03.627 --> 00:25:04.920
What the fuck, Smith?

272
00:25:05.921 --> 00:25:07.798
-Well?
-Well, what?

273
00:25:07.965 --> 00:25:09.425
We going?

274
00:25:10.801 --> 00:25:14.596
-Why should I tell you that?
-Because I'm me.

275
00:25:15.931 --> 00:25:19.601
Yeah. 3:00. Downtown.

276
00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.353
-Bakara market.
-All right.

277
00:25:21.603 --> 00:25:25.441
Listen, Smith, I need you to back me up
out there today, all right?

278
00:25:25.607 --> 00:25:26.817
Keep sharp.

279
00:25:29.486 --> 00:25:31.613
Yes, sir, Sergeant Eversmann.

280
00:25:31.822 --> 00:25:34.199
Ev, it's going to be nothing, man.

281
00:25:34.825 --> 00:25:36.118
Nothing.

282
00:25:38.996 --> 00:25:44.334
It's all in the grind, Sizemore.
Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

283
00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.129
This, my friend, is a science.

284
00:25:48.005 --> 00:25:50.841
You're looking at the guy
that believed the commercials.

285
00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:53.177
About "be all you can be."

286
00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:56.180
I made coffee through Desert Storm.

287
00:25:56.472 --> 00:25:59.683
I made coffee through Panama,
while everyone else got to fight...

288
00:25:59.892 --> 00:26:01.727
...got to be a Ranger.

289
00:26:02.436 --> 00:26:07.274
Now it's "Grimesy, black, one sugar"
or "Grimesy, got a powdered anywhere?"

290
00:26:11.153 --> 00:26:13.655
-What happened to you?
-Ping-Pong accident.

291
00:26:13.989 --> 00:26:14.990
What?

292
00:26:15.991 --> 00:26:17.326
So guess what.

293
00:26:17.951 --> 00:26:20.746
Your wish has been granted.
You're going out today.

294
00:26:20.954 --> 00:26:22.581
You're fucking me.

295
00:26:22.831 --> 00:26:25.292
You're taking my place
assisting the 60 gunner.

296
00:26:25.501 --> 00:26:28.670
Sergeant Eversmann said
to get your stuff and get ready.

297
00:26:29.838 --> 00:26:31.799
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

298
00:26:31.965 --> 00:26:33.300
Oh, yeah.

299
00:26:35.094 --> 00:26:36.178
Hell, yeah.

300
00:26:36.345 --> 00:26:40.015
Grimesy, stick with Waddell
and give him ammo when he needs it.

301
00:26:40.099 --> 00:26:41.391
-Hoo-ah?
-Hoo-ah.

302
00:26:41.517 --> 00:26:46.021
I wouldn't worry about that. Generally
speaking, Somalis can't shoot for shit.

303
00:26:46.188 --> 00:26:50.150
Just watch out for the sammys
throwing the rocks, and you'll be fine.

304
00:26:50.359 --> 00:26:51.485
Might even be fun.

305
00:26:51.527 --> 00:26:55.447
D-boys do their thing now.
All we got to do is cover them.

306
00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:58.408
Choppers going to cover us,
and we'll be all right.

307
00:26:59.284 --> 00:27:03.163
Look, you guys,
this is my first time as chalk leader...

308
00:27:03.372 --> 00:27:06.792
...but, this isn't our first time out together.
This is serious.

309
00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:10.379
We're Rangers, not some sorry-ass JROTC.

310
00:27:10.963 --> 00:27:12.214
We're elite.

311
00:27:12.923 --> 00:27:15.050
Let's act like it out there. Hoo-ah?

312
00:27:16.218 --> 00:27:17.886
Any questions?

313
00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:25.978
We're going to be okay.

314
00:27:26.812 --> 00:27:28.647
Grab your gear. Let's move out.

315
00:27:49.001 --> 00:27:53.005
You're not going to need that, dude.
We're not out there long enough.

316
00:28:00.971 --> 00:28:02.389
You won't need that, either.

317
00:28:02.931 --> 00:28:04.808
We'll be back before dark.

318
00:28:05.058 --> 00:28:07.603
You might as well take dope
and beer instead.

319
00:28:07.769 --> 00:28:09.104
What?

320
00:28:09.271 --> 00:28:11.231
Ammo, dude. Take ammo.

321
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:22.117
Let me tell you something, Grimes.
You got 50 pounds of gear.

322
00:28:22.326 --> 00:28:23.452
You don't need another 12.

323
00:28:23.577 --> 00:28:27.998
I don't know about you,
I don't plan on getting shot running away.

324
00:28:28.081 --> 00:28:29.625
Well, I better keep mine in.

325
00:28:29.791 --> 00:28:30.667
Grimes.

326
00:28:30.918 --> 00:28:32.961
Most important thing:

327
00:28:33.086 --> 00:28:36.340
Remember, when everyone is shooting,
shoot in the same direction.

328
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:48.310
Look at this.
He's taping his blood type to his boots.

329
00:28:48.477 --> 00:28:52.022
-That's bad luck.
-No, it's smart.

330
00:28:52.314 --> 00:28:54.149
All Delta do that.

331
00:28:54.942 --> 00:28:56.944
That's bad luck too, man.

332
00:28:57.444 --> 00:28:58.570
Come on, let's go.

333
00:29:02.157 --> 00:29:04.993
It's a good thing
you're right-handed, Adonis.

334
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:11.333
-If not, I don't know what you'd do.
-You're a funny guy, man.

335
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.754
-I'm not taking no death letter.
-We have a deal.

336
00:29:18.548 --> 00:29:20.550
I'll give it to you back in an hour.

337
00:29:20.801 --> 00:29:25.013
-Blackburn, you okay?
-Excited.

338
00:29:26.473 --> 00:29:29.977
In a good way.
I've been training my whole life for this.

339
00:29:30.352 --> 00:29:32.354
You ever shot at anybody before?

340
00:29:32.938 --> 00:29:33.939
No, sir.

341
00:29:35.524 --> 00:29:36.775
Me neither.

342
00:30:11.018 --> 00:30:12.477
Think he's reliable?

343
00:30:12.561 --> 00:30:16.064
Well, we'll see. It's his first time out.

344
00:30:24.156 --> 00:30:26.616
-Tell him to turn his damn radio off.
-Yes, sir.

345
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.535
Tell him to turn his radio off.

346
00:30:28.577 --> 00:30:31.580
Abdi, you need to turn your radio off.

347
00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:42.591
Hi. You've reached Stephanie and Randy,
leave us a message. Thank you.

348
00:30:44.926 --> 00:30:47.346
Hey, baby, it's me. Are you there?

349
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:50.932
Pick up if you're there.

350
00:30:51.767 --> 00:30:54.770
I'm just calling
to make sure everything's all right.

351
00:30:55.354 --> 00:30:57.773
I'll call you in a couple hours.

352
00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:00.776
You'd better not be sleeping.

353
00:31:01.777 --> 00:31:03.070
Your move, Randy.

354
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.323
I'm missing you.

355
00:31:07.366 --> 00:31:09.117
I love you, baby.

356
00:31:10.577 --> 00:31:11.912
Hello? Hello?

357
00:31:14.122 --> 00:31:15.374
Thanks, bud.

358
00:31:17.751 --> 00:31:19.628
You know, it's kind of funny.

359
00:31:20.253 --> 00:31:23.382
Beautiful beach, beautiful sun.

360
00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:27.010
Could almost be a good place to visit.

361
00:31:27.135 --> 00:31:28.553
Almost.

362
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.309
You don't think we should be here.

363
00:31:35.227 --> 00:31:39.689
You know what I think?
It don't really matter what I think.

364
00:31:41.024 --> 00:31:45.404
Once that first bullet goes past your head,
politics and all that shit...

365
00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.697
...just goes right out the window.

366
00:31:48.323 --> 00:31:50.492
I just want to do it right today.

367
00:31:51.159 --> 00:31:54.996
Just watch your corner.
Get all your men back here alive.

368
00:32:20.188 --> 00:32:24.025
Now, is this supposed to be the place,
or did his car just take a dump?

369
00:32:24.234 --> 00:32:25.694
Abdi, come in.

370
00:32:26.194 --> 00:32:28.655
Abdi, can you hear me? Is this the place?

371
00:32:32.993 --> 00:32:34.202
Abdi, come in.

372
00:32:39.499 --> 00:32:42.085
Can you hear me? Abdi.

373
00:32:42.878 --> 00:32:45.881
Abdi, come in. Is this the place?

374
00:32:46.047 --> 00:32:48.550
To my right side, above the cafe.

375
00:32:48.884 --> 00:32:51.178
He says this is the building.

376
00:32:51.386 --> 00:32:52.846
He's certain?

377
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:55.265
Abdi, you need to be sure.

378
00:32:55.515 --> 00:32:56.892
Are you sure?

379
00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:02.898
Well, it's down the road,
two blocks over on my left.

380
00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:05.734
But there's too many militia.

381
00:33:06.276 --> 00:33:08.612
If I go closer, they might shoot me.

382
00:33:08.987 --> 00:33:12.115
Now he's saying the building's
a couple blocks down...

383
00:33:12.324 --> 00:33:14.701
...but if he's seen outside it, he'll be shot.

384
00:33:15.494 --> 00:33:17.662
I'll fucking shoot him myself.

385
00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:21.416
Tell him I want his skinny ass
parked in front of the building.

386
00:33:21.458 --> 00:33:24.628
He's not getting paid
till he does exactly that.

387
00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:28.048
Three miles to the target.
We're never off the main roads.

388
00:33:28.089 --> 00:33:31.301
At K-four traffic circle, we turn north,
then east on National...

389
00:33:31.384 --> 00:33:34.596
...and we wait until extraction of prisoners
IS complete here.

390
00:33:34.638 --> 00:33:36.598
Then we roll up in force on Hawlwadig...

391
00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:40.227
...load the prisoners, the assault-blocking
forces and bring them back.

392
00:33:40.936 --> 00:33:43.104
Home in an hour. Okay?

393
00:33:43.313 --> 00:33:46.608
There will be some shooting.
Bakara market is the Wild West.

394
00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:49.945
But be careful what you shoot at.
People do live there.

395
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:51.821
Hoo-ah.

396
00:34:03.792 --> 00:34:07.963
Last one of these guys shot himself
in the head playing Russian roulette.

397
00:34:21.643 --> 00:34:23.979
Sir, the vehicle is stopped.

398
00:34:24.771 --> 00:34:28.149
So this is the real deal now.
He's sure this time.

399
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:33.280
-He sounds scared shit less.
-Good. That's always a good sign.

400
00:34:44.666 --> 00:34:46.835
That's it. That's our signal.

401
00:34:47.002 --> 00:34:48.336
All right.

402
00:34:48.837 --> 00:34:51.631
All QRF out of the airspace.

403
00:34:53.008 --> 00:34:55.176
All QRF out of the airspace.

404
00:35:00.015 --> 00:35:04.519
All units, Irene. I say again, Irene.

405
00:35:12.027 --> 00:35:16.615
Check in when ready. Barber 51 up
and ready. Star 41 up and ready.

406
00:35:16.865 --> 00:35:18.074
Irene!

407
00:35:18.742 --> 00:35:20.201
Copy, Irene.

408
00:35:21.077 --> 00:35:22.370
Fucking Irene!

409
00:35:36.259 --> 00:35:37.093
Come on.

410
00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:45.018
Good luck, boys.

411
00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.519
Be careful.

412
00:35:46.895 --> 00:35:49.022
No one gets left behind.

413
00:35:50.899 --> 00:35:52.233
What's wrong?

414
00:35:53.068 --> 00:35:56.237
Nothing. He's just never done that before.

415
00:35:57.238 --> 00:35:58.740
Aw, fuck!

416
00:36:02.869 --> 00:36:04.037
Let's go.

417
00:36:05.038 --> 00:36:07.791
Sergeant Struecker. Let's roll.

418
00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:48.326
Two minutes.

419
00:38:49.494 --> 00:38:50.912
Two minutes.

420
00:39:36.082 --> 00:39:38.668
Why are they burning tires?

421
00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.796
Signals to the militia that we're coming!

422
00:39:43.965 --> 00:39:47.302
Okay, 56, looks like there's some friendlies
on the ground.

423
00:39:47.468 --> 00:39:50.471
Looks like I've got a tally on the voice.

424
00:39:56.978 --> 00:39:58.271
One minute.

425
00:39:59.647 --> 00:40:00.857
One minute.

426
00:40:05.278 --> 00:40:06.613
What's that for?

427
00:40:07.906 --> 00:40:10.867
Last rope, I almost bit my tongue off.

428
00:40:42.398 --> 00:40:43.775
Touching base.

429
00:40:47.612 --> 00:40:49.530
Two feet, one foot...

430
00:40:51.032 --> 00:40:52.367
...clear.

431
00:40:53.451 --> 00:40:56.454
Little birds touching down at target.

432
00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.083
Ropes!

433
00:41:43.376 --> 00:41:45.878
Go! Go! Go!

434
00:41:52.927 --> 00:41:56.597
Chalk One troops are on the deck.
Chalk Two deployed.

435
00:41:56.764 --> 00:42:00.101
This is McKnight.
Uniform 64 approaching staging area.

436
00:42:11.821 --> 00:42:13.406
Down! Get down!

437
00:42:13.614 --> 00:42:15.366
Down! Stay down!

438
00:42:15.575 --> 00:42:17.285
Get down! Everybody down!

439
00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:18.786
You, down!

440
00:42:18.995 --> 00:42:20.038
Get down!

441
00:42:20.121 --> 00:42:21.122
On the floor.

442
00:42:27.462 --> 00:42:28.921
Let's go, let's go!

443
00:42:30.298 --> 00:42:32.675
Grimesy! No fear!

444
00:42:32.925 --> 00:42:34.761
Oh, yeah, right!

445
00:42:38.473 --> 00:42:41.309
Rangers securing perimeter. Four corners.

446
00:42:41.642 --> 00:42:44.270
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

447
00:42:44.937 --> 00:42:46.939
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

448
00:42:46.981 --> 00:42:48.316
Well, shoot back!

449
00:42:52.153 --> 00:42:55.239
This is 64. Chalks on the ground,
going into holding pattern.

450
00:42:55.323 --> 00:42:58.117
This is 62, delivered chalks.
Going to cover pattern.

451
00:42:58.159 --> 00:43:02.288
Super 62, take up an overhead pattern
to provide sniper cover. Over.

452
00:43:02.455 --> 00:43:05.833
This is Super 65. Chalks on the ground,
going into holding pattern.

453
00:43:11.839 --> 00:43:15.176
Go, Blackburn, go! Go!

454
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:16.761
Go, Blackburn!

455
00:43:19.263 --> 00:43:20.473
RPG!

456
00:43:20.681 --> 00:43:22.141
Hold on!

457
00:43:25.103 --> 00:43:26.312
No!

458
00:43:36.781 --> 00:43:38.825
C-2, we got a man fallen.

459
00:43:39.408 --> 00:43:41.911
Super-61, you're a sitting duck.

460
00:43:42.328 --> 00:43:45.540
Take up overhead pattern
to provide sniper cover. Over.

461
00:43:45.748 --> 00:43:48.042
Roger that. 61 coming out.

462
00:43:49.252 --> 00:43:53.589
13, go ahead. I need you to move to
the north of the street.

463
00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:56.425
Right to the north. Right there. Over.

464
00:43:57.718 --> 00:43:59.512
Doc! Doc Schmid!

465
00:43:59.887 --> 00:44:01.264
Come on!

466
00:44:01.514 --> 00:44:04.058
Schmid, we got a man hit.

467
00:44:06.018 --> 00:44:08.938
-Where's he hit?
-He's not. He fell.

468
00:44:09.021 --> 00:44:10.982
-What?
-He fell.

469
00:44:14.235 --> 00:44:16.028
Why aren't you shooting?

470
00:44:16.237 --> 00:44:18.072
We're not being shot at yet!

471
00:44:18.281 --> 00:44:19.699
How can you tell?

472
00:44:19.866 --> 00:44:21.450
A hiss means it's close.

473
00:44:21.534 --> 00:44:22.952
A snap means--

474
00:44:23.202 --> 00:44:24.996
Now they're shooting at us!

475
00:44:33.754 --> 00:44:34.964
Galentine!

476
00:44:38.801 --> 00:44:41.429
Get me Captain Steele!
Get me Captain Steele!

477
00:44:41.804 --> 00:44:45.099
Juliet 64, this is Juliet 25. Come in. Over.

478
00:44:45.266 --> 00:44:47.101
Blackburn, can you hear me?

479
00:44:47.268 --> 00:44:50.438
Juliet 64, this is 25. Come in. Over.

480
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:52.148
I can't get him!

481
00:44:53.149 --> 00:44:56.652
Juliet 64, this is Chalk Four!
We've got a man down!

482
00:44:56.777 --> 00:44:58.779
We need to get him out of here! Over.

483
00:44:58.821 --> 00:45:01.949
This is 64. Say again, 25. Over.

484
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.203
We've got a man down! Over.

485
00:45:06.787 --> 00:45:09.957
Take a breath, 25, and calm down. Over.

486
00:45:10.458 --> 00:45:13.127
-Man down!
-Missed that, 25.

487
00:45:13.211 --> 00:45:15.046
-Fuck it.
-Say again.

488
00:45:15.129 --> 00:45:17.340
Matt, it's a long way to the humvees!

489
00:45:17.423 --> 00:45:20.801
We'll get a stretcher in here.
Get him to the target building.

490
00:45:21.052 --> 00:45:22.428
What did he say?

491
00:45:22.637 --> 00:45:26.474
Super 61,
we got a man wounded on the ground.

492
00:45:27.308 --> 00:45:30.228
-Stretcher!
-Get me a stretcher!

493
00:45:30.478 --> 00:45:32.313
Come on. Stretcher.

494
00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:33.814
Come on, come on!

495
00:45:34.732 --> 00:45:36.317
Grab this end!

496
00:45:37.652 --> 00:45:39.320
Let's go!

497
00:45:40.154 --> 00:45:42.114
-All right.
-Go.

498
00:45:42.406 --> 00:45:44.867
Get him to the humvees.
We'll hold down the corner.

499
00:45:44.951 --> 00:45:46.744
Up to the humvees! Now!

500
00:45:50.331 --> 00:45:52.500
Go! Go!

501
00:45:54.335 --> 00:45:56.504
Keep moving, Grimes! Run!

502
00:46:01.342 --> 00:46:03.010
-Secure!
-Let's move out!

503
00:46:03.094 --> 00:46:05.304
Everybody up! Let's go!

504
00:46:05.513 --> 00:46:06.847
Come on!

505
00:46:06.931 --> 00:46:08.599
Let's go! Let's move!

506
00:46:11.769 --> 00:46:14.313
-Grimes, run!
-All right.

507
00:46:17.108 --> 00:46:21.028
C-2, this is Super 61,
beginning my orbit of the target area.

508
00:46:21.279 --> 00:46:24.532
Chalk Four, clear for a clear. Coming in.

509
00:46:25.825 --> 00:46:29.870
Kilo 11, this is 61,
providing cover for prisoner extract. Over.

510
00:46:30.121 --> 00:46:31.831
Kilo 64, green light.

511
00:46:32.164 --> 00:46:35.459
-Ready for extraction. Over.
-Roger that. Will relay.

512
00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:37.962
That's it. We got them.

513
00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:41.549
Uniform 64, ready for extraction. Over.

514
00:46:41.924 --> 00:46:44.552
Roger that. There's the call.
Let's move out!

515
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.595
-Let's move out!
-Hold on.

516
00:47:08.743 --> 00:47:11.329
-How much longer?
-Five minutes, sir.

517
00:47:11.412 --> 00:47:12.997
-What?
-Five minutes.

518
00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.707
Nothing takes five minutes!

519
00:47:20.212 --> 00:47:21.630
What happened to him?

520
00:47:21.714 --> 00:47:25.051
-He fell! Missed the rope!
-How'd he do that?

521
00:47:25.885 --> 00:47:29.055
Put him in that humvee!
Grimes, give him a hand!

522
00:47:29.472 --> 00:47:31.390
Let's go! Let's move it!

523
00:47:31.557 --> 00:47:33.726
Move, move! Come on! Move!

524
00:47:35.895 --> 00:47:37.271
Get him in there!

525
00:47:37.313 --> 00:47:38.814
Get ready to move!

526
00:47:39.398 --> 00:47:41.400
Go! Everybody move! Move!

527
00:47:42.276 --> 00:47:44.028
Get the fuck up!

528
00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:46.614
Grimes! Come on!

529
00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:49.158
Grimes! Grimes!

530
00:47:57.083 --> 00:47:58.834
Fuck this!

531
00:48:22.024 --> 00:48:23.192
Fuck!

532
00:48:28.906 --> 00:48:30.116
Let's go.

533
00:48:30.699 --> 00:48:31.909
Come on!

534
00:48:32.701 --> 00:48:34.161
Go! Move it!

535
00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:35.371
Move!

536
00:48:35.538 --> 00:48:38.749
Romeo 64, I need to send out
three humvees with a casualty.

537
00:48:38.833 --> 00:48:40.876
He looks real bad. I need to evac now.

538
00:48:41.043 --> 00:48:42.420
Roger that, Uniform 64.

539
00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:45.172
We'll chop a team of gun ships to you.
Over.

540
00:48:45.256 --> 00:48:46.841
Roger that.

541
00:48:47.258 --> 00:48:49.510
I need extra security on these humvees!

542
00:48:49.552 --> 00:48:52.680
I'll go. I'll take my team,
make sure they get back okay.

543
00:48:52.721 --> 00:48:53.764
Do it.

544
00:48:54.014 --> 00:48:56.058
Struecker, you're lead humvee.

545
00:49:01.105 --> 00:49:04.358
First three vehicles mount up,
we're moving back to base.

546
00:49:05.693 --> 00:49:06.944
Move out!

547
00:49:24.295 --> 00:49:26.797
How are things going?
Things okay there, Struecker?

548
00:49:26.881 --> 00:49:29.133
I don't want to talk about it now, Colonel!

549
00:49:29.216 --> 00:49:30.551
I'm busy.

550
00:49:59.163 --> 00:50:00.748
Sergeant Pilla's hit!

551
00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:03.751
Christ, he's fucked up!

552
00:50:03.918 --> 00:50:05.252
Is anyone hit?

553
00:50:05.753 --> 00:50:07.171
Struecker, talk to me!

554
00:50:07.254 --> 00:50:08.923
It's Sergeant Pitta!

555
00:50:09.423 --> 00:50:10.925
What's his status?

556
00:50:11.926 --> 00:50:13.302
What's his status?

557
00:50:13.928 --> 00:50:15.262
He's dead.

558
00:50:16.263 --> 00:50:17.598
He's dead.

559
00:50:17.765 --> 00:50:19.266
Pilla's dead, sir.

560
00:50:21.602 --> 00:50:26.524
C-2, this is McKnight.
We have a KIA Dominick Pitta. Over.

561
00:50:27.024 --> 00:50:28.526
Roger that.

562
00:50:29.193 --> 00:50:31.195
Get on that 50!

563
00:50:31.445 --> 00:50:33.614
Someone get on that 50!

564
00:50:33.864 --> 00:50:35.282
It's mine.

565
00:51:21.579 --> 00:51:24.832
Three guys with RPGs,
coming up on your side now!

566
00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:33.465
Stay with it!

567
00:51:34.425 --> 00:51:37.136
This is 61. I'm hit. I'm hit.

568
00:51:37.803 --> 00:51:42.099
Super 61 is hit. He is hit.
Wolcott's bird is hit.

569
00:51:44.351 --> 00:51:46.937
You want to pull those PCLs off-line
or what?

570
00:51:47.146 --> 00:51:48.439
Right, babe.

571
00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:50.441
Come on.

572
00:51:57.448 --> 00:51:58.782
61, going down.

573
00:51:58.949 --> 00:52:00.200
61 going down.

574
00:52:00.284 --> 00:52:02.703
61 is going down.

575
00:52:04.163 --> 00:52:06.498
Super 61 is going down.

576
00:52:07.041 --> 00:52:09.001
Super 61 is going down.

577
00:52:09.209 --> 00:52:12.046
61 is going down.
I repeat, it's going down.

578
00:52:12.212 --> 00:52:14.048
61's going down.

579
00:52:16.383 --> 00:52:17.926
Hold on!

580
00:52:40.574 --> 00:52:43.410
We got a Black Hawk down.
We got a Black Hawk down.

581
00:52:44.745 --> 00:52:47.915
Super 61 is down.
We got a bird down in the city.

582
00:52:48.123 --> 00:52:50.084
Super 61 is on the deck now.

583
00:52:51.085 --> 00:52:53.712
Get an MH-six on site. Check for survivors.

584
00:52:53.921 --> 00:52:55.756
Send in the SAR bird.

585
00:52:55.964 --> 00:52:59.760
I want ground forces to move and secure
a new perimeter around that crash site.

586
00:52:59.802 --> 00:53:01.887
Can you guide the convoy in there?

587
00:53:01.929 --> 00:53:03.097
Roger that.

588
00:53:03.138 --> 00:53:04.473
Well, move quick.

589
00:53:05.599 --> 00:53:08.060
The whole city
will be coming down on top of them.

590
00:53:08.894 --> 00:53:12.731
Star 41, come inbound
and see if you can land at the crash site.

591
00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:15.275
Roger that. Star 41 inbound.

592
00:53:27.287 --> 00:53:29.081
We just lost the initiative.

593
00:53:35.838 --> 00:53:37.297
25, this is 64. Over.

594
00:53:37.923 --> 00:53:39.299
25. Over.

595
00:53:39.925 --> 00:53:43.178
25, Chalk Four is closest to the crash site.
Over.

596
00:53:43.429 --> 00:53:45.931
64, I can't see the crash site. Over.

597
00:53:46.765 --> 00:53:49.435
25, it's due east of you. You will find it.

598
00:53:49.601 --> 00:53:53.397
Leave a security element in place.
Take the rest of your chalk to the crash.

599
00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:56.817
Check for survivors. Secure the area.
All other chalks will follow.

600
00:53:59.445 --> 00:54:01.530
25, do you read me? Over.

601
00:54:02.197 --> 00:54:04.533
Galentine! Schmid!

602
00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:05.826
Get Yurek.

603
00:54:06.034 --> 00:54:07.327
Get Twombly.

604
00:54:07.578 --> 00:54:09.872
Hey, there's a Black Hawk down.

605
00:54:10.038 --> 00:54:11.832
Twombly, Nelson, stay here.

606
00:54:11.999 --> 00:54:14.877
Hold this corner
and then exfil with the humvees.

607
00:54:15.085 --> 00:54:18.922
Galentine, Schmid, you're coming with me.
Let's go.

608
00:54:19.423 --> 00:54:21.508
How come I got to stay back here?

609
00:54:21.675 --> 00:54:23.385
Because you're dependable.

610
00:54:24.553 --> 00:54:25.846
All right...

611
00:54:27.514 --> 00:54:28.849
...let's go!

612
00:54:34.104 --> 00:54:36.064
I hate being dependable, man.

613
00:54:50.454 --> 00:54:53.999
Juliet 25, hostiles advancing,
parallel west to your position.

614
00:54:54.082 --> 00:54:56.376
Women and children among them. Over.

615
00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:57.711
Hit the wall.

616
00:55:13.811 --> 00:55:15.729
Incoming!

617
00:55:21.401 --> 00:55:22.820
Grenade!

618
00:55:38.919 --> 00:55:40.087
Go.

619
00:55:50.806 --> 00:55:52.933
We still got guys inside!

620
00:55:53.141 --> 00:55:54.768
I'll go to the crash.

621
00:55:54.935 --> 00:55:58.772
You take the rest of the team.
I'll finish loading the prisoners.

622
00:55:58.939 --> 00:56:01.275
No! We'll go to the crash site together.

623
00:56:01.316 --> 00:56:03.569
Secure the perimeter,
wait for the humvees.

624
00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:05.445
-Roger that.
-Follow my lead.

625
00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:08.115
Sarg'nt, are you receiving me?

626
00:56:08.198 --> 00:56:10.868
Yeah, I heard you.
We should be leaving soon.

627
00:56:12.744 --> 00:56:15.539
All right, we need to move out now!

628
00:56:15.622 --> 00:56:18.834
I'll finish loading the prisoners
and pick you up at the crash site!

629
00:56:18.917 --> 00:56:20.127
Let's move out!

630
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:21.628
Moving out! Go!

631
00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:30.721
Get in! Get in!

632
00:56:30.929 --> 00:56:32.180
Move!

633
00:56:45.652 --> 00:56:47.154
Eight o'clock!

634
00:57:01.168 --> 00:57:03.462
Grimes, stay away from the walls.

635
00:57:18.352 --> 00:57:20.687
Grimes. You okay?

636
00:57:21.021 --> 00:57:22.314
Yeah!

637
00:57:24.358 --> 00:57:25.734
Let's go, Maddox.

638
00:57:26.193 --> 00:57:28.528
-C-2, convoy's moving out.
-Roger that.

639
00:57:28.695 --> 00:57:31.365
Maddox, look at these jerks! These idiots!

640
00:57:31.573 --> 00:57:34.159
Go, go! Right, Maddox, right!

641
00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:46.213
Twombly, the convoy is leaving!

642
00:57:46.588 --> 00:57:48.382
Hey, Twombly!

643
00:57:49.216 --> 00:57:50.217
What?

644
00:57:50.425 --> 00:57:52.928
- I think they've forgotten us.
-What?

645
00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:54.638
It doesn't matter.

646
00:58:02.354 --> 00:58:07.109
63 confirm. skinnies are moving in
on all sides. They need help now.

647
00:58:08.402 --> 00:58:12.197
Indigenous personnel
advancing to Wolcott crash site.

648
00:58:13.573 --> 00:58:14.866
Say again. Over.

649
00:58:14.908 --> 00:58:17.244
A lot of people closing in.

650
00:58:19.538 --> 00:58:22.124
How far is Chalk Four from the crash site?

651
00:58:22.374 --> 00:58:25.460
-Six blocks, sir.
-They need to haul ass.

652
00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:21.183
Get down! Get down!

653
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:23.977
Scotty, are you okay?

654
00:59:26.021 --> 00:59:27.481
No, don't go back!

655
00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.284
Get down! Get down!

656
00:59:41.661 --> 00:59:42.996
Technicals!

657
00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:44.831
Got them!

658
00:59:52.005 --> 00:59:53.840
Six o'clock! Move, move!

659
01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:17.864
Go, go, go!

660
01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:24.621
Go, go!

661
01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.417
Come on!

662
01:00:37.926 --> 01:00:39.636
Yurek, leaving!

663
01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:43.765
Come on!

664
01:02:11.228 --> 01:02:14.856
Uniform 64, left turn. Left turn.

665
01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:19.444
Romeo 64, I need to know before I get to
the goddamn street!

666
01:02:19.653 --> 01:02:22.239
You have to slow down. There's a delay.

667
01:02:22.447 --> 01:02:27.035
From the time directions are relayed
from surveillance to JOC, then to me.

668
01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:30.163
We can't slow down!
We're taking heavy enemy fire!

669
01:02:30.288 --> 01:02:31.998
We can't slow down!

670
01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:35.961
Danny, I'm getting information
from Orion surveillance above.

671
01:02:36.169 --> 01:02:38.880
So get me my fucking directions to
the crash site!

672
01:02:38.964 --> 01:02:43.009
Danny, hold on. I no longer have
the best view of your route.

673
01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:45.762
Get your ass in the right place,
goddamn it!

674
01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:49.224
What in the hell is the status
of Struecker's humvees?

675
01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:52.269
Colonel Harrell, ETA to base,
Struecker's column.

676
01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:55.105
ETA to base momentarily.

677
01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:03.363
Open the gate!

678
01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:27.721
-Get him out! Let's go! Let's go!
-Come on.

679
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:31.850
Watch his head.

680
01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:33.268
Easy.

681
01:03:41.192 --> 01:03:43.945
-Blackburn, can you hear me?
-Get him to a medic.

682
01:04:18.438 --> 01:04:21.983
Star 41 is at the crash site
to evacuate the injured. Over.

683
01:04:22.067 --> 01:04:23.151
Roger that.

684
01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:03.858
I got you.

685
01:05:04.442 --> 01:05:05.652
Easy.

686
01:05:12.826 --> 01:05:14.702
Galentine, you all right?

687
01:05:14.828 --> 01:05:18.623
Galentine, Kurth, with me!
Cover fire, now.

688
01:05:18.665 --> 01:05:20.333
Full cover!

689
01:05:34.806 --> 01:05:36.141
How many are in there?

690
01:05:36.182 --> 01:05:38.977
Two pilots are dead,
two crew chiefs are wounded!

691
01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:42.689
-He's hurt bad. We must get out of here.
-All right. Go ahead.

692
01:06:15.013 --> 01:06:18.725
26, this is 25.
Is that you shooting up the technicals?

693
01:06:19.767 --> 01:06:21.394
This is 26. Roger that.

694
01:06:21.436 --> 01:06:25.565
DiTomasso, take the southeast corner.
We're setting up a perimeter. Over.

695
01:06:25.773 --> 01:06:28.443
This is 26. Roger that. Moving there now.

696
01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:29.944
Move out!

697
01:06:32.697 --> 01:06:35.074
Captain Steele, come in.

698
01:06:36.784 --> 01:06:38.661
Go ahead, 25. This is 64.

699
01:06:39.037 --> 01:06:43.666
We got two wounded and we got both
the pilots dead in the chopper!

700
01:06:44.042 --> 01:06:45.627
We need a medivac now!

701
01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:51.424
It's too hot to land a bird.
You must secure the perimeter first. Over.

702
01:06:52.258 --> 01:06:53.426
Where are the humvees?

703
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:56.471
Be advised, 25, the convoy will be there.

704
01:06:56.554 --> 01:06:59.682
They're encountering a lot of resistance.
64 out.

705
01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:15.448
-Get the 50 up!
-You should see the crash directly ahead.

706
01:07:15.657 --> 01:07:18.117
All I see is a roadblock!

707
01:07:19.285 --> 01:07:21.704
I'll have to figure out another way.

708
01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:50.191
Give me a defensive perimeter
so we can load the wounded.

709
01:08:10.336 --> 01:08:12.046
Fire your weapon, Othic!

710
01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.270
Tell my girls I'll be okay.

711
01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:38.197
Medic!

712
01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.116
Hoo-ah!

713
01:09:08.895 --> 01:09:10.897
Medic! Medic!

714
01:09:11.522 --> 01:09:15.610
Joyce! Joyce!
Come on, help me pick him up!

715
01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:21.407
Get us off this fucking street!
Where's the crash site? Say again.

716
01:09:21.574 --> 01:09:24.744
Keep going straight 200 meters.

717
01:09:24.952 --> 01:09:26.079
Roger that.

718
01:09:27.664 --> 01:09:28.956
Let's go!

719
01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:31.501
Let's go, goddamn it, let's go!

720
01:09:49.769 --> 01:09:52.313
Hey, Twombles. Come here.

721
01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:58.820
The humvees ain't coming back, dude.

722
01:09:59.445 --> 01:10:00.571
What?

723
01:10:01.948 --> 01:10:03.866
Were we supposed to go to them?

724
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:06.035
I thought they were coming to us.

725
01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:10.832
-I think we're supposed to go to them.
-Shit.

726
01:10:14.168 --> 01:10:15.753
Let's go to the crash site.

727
01:10:15.795 --> 01:10:16.796
Okay.

728
01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:20.425
Don't fire that thing so close to my head.
I can barely hear as it is.

729
01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:21.467
Move out.

730
01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:36.190
Shit! Get down!

731
01:10:38.317 --> 01:10:41.821
What did I just tell you?
If you do that again--

732
01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:48.202
You okay? Nelson.

733
01:10:48.828 --> 01:10:51.164
You all right?

734
01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:54.834
Search and rescue bird on station
inserting medics.

735
01:11:06.679 --> 01:11:07.680
Go!

736
01:11:12.143 --> 01:11:13.644
Go, go!

737
01:11:16.022 --> 01:11:19.484
Son of a bitch. C-2, this is 68.
We've been hit.

738
01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:22.987
Super 68, there is smoke coming
from the top of your rotor.

739
01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:25.323
-Advise you to come out now.
-Roger.

740
01:11:25.823 --> 01:11:27.200
Dropping last man.

741
01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:34.040
Art, I've got skinnies with RPGs at 12:00.
Can you see them?

742
01:11:34.332 --> 01:11:36.501
Got them. Give me 90 degrees left.

743
01:11:46.552 --> 01:11:47.845
68 coming out.

744
01:11:49.847 --> 01:11:52.225
Super 68 is out. Over.

745
01:12:02.109 --> 01:12:04.695
Hey, Wilkie, what's the situation in there?

746
01:12:04.946 --> 01:12:06.781
Both pilots are dead.

747
01:12:07.615 --> 01:12:10.743
25, we can't move these guys, Matty.

748
01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:12.745
We'll kill them just carrying them.

749
01:12:12.787 --> 01:12:15.206
-Stabilize in here?
-Roger.

750
01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:18.709
Stabilize in the bird.
Repeat: Stabilize in here. Over.

751
01:12:18.793 --> 01:12:20.920
Understood, Wilkie.
We got you covered. Over.

752
01:12:20.962 --> 01:12:24.465
Super 64, come inbound
and take Wolcott's position.

753
01:12:25.424 --> 01:12:27.760
Roger. 64 is inbound.

754
01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:56.497
Super 64, you all right?

755
01:12:56.581 --> 01:12:59.375
This is Super 64. We're good.

756
01:12:59.584 --> 01:13:02.461
You sure?
You look like you got clipped pretty good.

757
01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:04.630
Instrument panels are okay.

758
01:13:04.964 --> 01:13:08.801
No, we're good. Got a slight vibration
in the pedals, but we're good.

759
01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:13.973
All right, put her down on the airfield, 64.
Have it checked out just to be safe.

760
01:13:14.473 --> 01:13:15.474
Roger.

761
01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:22.315
I'm getting movement in these pedals.
Check the systems again.

762
01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:39.999
We lost the tail rotor! It's gone!

763
01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:41.834
64 is going down!

764
01:13:43.002 --> 01:13:44.503
64 is going in hard.

765
01:13:46.339 --> 01:13:48.090
64 going down.

766
01:13:53.012 --> 01:13:54.847
We're going down.

767
01:13:59.852 --> 01:14:01.729
Get Struecker's column back out there.

768
01:14:01.812 --> 01:14:04.106
They need to get to
Durant's crash site fast.

769
01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:06.817
-Another bird down.
- I want them out of there.

770
01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:08.486
All of them.

771
01:14:12.823 --> 01:14:15.952
Captain Steele, we got to move
or we'll get pinned down!

772
01:14:16.202 --> 01:14:18.204
We're moving as fast as we can.

773
01:14:18.329 --> 01:14:21.499
You let me do my job and you do yours.
Over.

774
01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:32.635
-Fuck! Fuck!
-Ruiz stay down.

775
01:14:32.718 --> 01:14:33.886
-I fucking knew--
-Medic.

776
01:14:33.928 --> 01:14:37.723
Fuck this! Captain Steele,
I'll take out the threat in the window.

777
01:14:37.974 --> 01:14:40.226
We'll rally at the gray building.
Coming through.

778
01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:40.851
Sarg'nt!

779
01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:42.228
All right, let's move!

780
01:14:48.067 --> 01:14:49.402
Cover me!

781
01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:57.910
-Let's go, let's move!
-Moving out.

782
01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:04.125
Friendly!

783
01:15:04.208 --> 01:15:05.918
Friendlies coming through!

784
01:15:06.002 --> 01:15:08.379
Let's go, let's go! Move up!

785
01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:10.506
Come on, come on!

786
01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:12.049
Come on!

787
01:15:19.724 --> 01:15:21.434
Move up! Go! Move up!

788
01:15:21.809 --> 01:15:23.561
What the fuck are you doing out there?

789
01:15:23.602 --> 01:15:26.313
Doing my job!
We got to get to that crash site!

790
01:15:26.647 --> 01:15:29.442
We got to get on that street,
and we got to move!

791
01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:31.986
And you have got to keep up, sir!

792
01:15:32.153 --> 01:15:34.321
Don't you ever give me orders, Sergeant.

793
01:15:34.405 --> 01:15:36.866
We are combat ineffective, understand?

794
01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:38.993
We got too many wounded to move!

795
01:15:39.076 --> 01:15:42.288
Then give me some shooters
and I'll circle us to the bird.

796
01:15:44.999 --> 01:15:47.501
Grimes! You're with Chalk Four?

797
01:15:47.668 --> 01:15:48.711
Yes, sir!

798
01:15:48.919 --> 01:15:52.339
All right, hook up with Delta!
Rejoin with Sergeant Eversmann.

799
01:15:52.923 --> 01:15:55.176
The rest of you, secure this position!

800
01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:57.636
Treat the wounded,
we'll wait for the convoy!

801
01:15:57.678 --> 01:16:00.222
Then we'll rally at the crash site. Roger!

802
01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:01.807
My guys, let's go!

803
01:16:32.713 --> 01:16:35.716
C-2, I have two Delta snipers,
Shughart and Gordon...

804
01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:38.511
...volunteering to secure crash site two.
Over.

805
01:16:39.136 --> 01:16:43.307
No, Super 62, negative that request.
Can't risk another bird.

806
01:16:45.142 --> 01:16:49.063
We don't see anything moving down there,
we don't even know if anyone's alive.

807
01:16:50.356 --> 01:16:53.067
A ground team is being organized
to go in now.

808
01:16:53.234 --> 01:16:54.985
ETA on ground team? Over.

809
01:16:55.152 --> 01:16:58.239
Unknown, not long.

810
01:16:58.405 --> 01:17:00.741
Do what you can from the air.

811
01:17:04.745 --> 01:17:06.539
All right, gather around!

812
01:17:06.664 --> 01:17:09.875
Durant's 64 is down.
We're going back in to get him!

813
01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:12.086
That's crazy. Is there anyone alive?

814
01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:14.547
Doesn't matter, no one gets left behind.

815
01:17:14.797 --> 01:17:17.007
We're wasting time here.

816
01:17:17.174 --> 01:17:20.219
Refit and max out ammo and grenades,
you got five!

817
01:17:21.428 --> 01:17:23.264
Sizemore, where are you going?

818
01:17:23.347 --> 01:17:26.183
-With you guys.
-Not with that cast on you're not.

819
01:17:27.059 --> 01:17:30.354
All right, all right, all right.
Go get your k-pot.

820
01:17:32.606 --> 01:17:33.816
Talk to me.

821
01:17:34.108 --> 01:17:35.484
I can't go back out there.

822
01:17:35.568 --> 01:17:40.114
Thomas, everyone feels
the same way you do. All right?

823
01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:43.534
It's what you do right now
that makes a difference.

824
01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:46.078
It's your call.

825
01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:47.580
Hoo-ah?

826
01:17:53.752 --> 01:17:54.962
Hoo-ah.

827
01:18:11.312 --> 01:18:14.940
It'll probably help to wash
the blood out of the humvees.

828
01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:25.868
Sergeant Struecker!

829
01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:29.872
Sergeant Struecker! Can I go, Sarge?

830
01:18:30.289 --> 01:18:32.208
-You got some ammo?
-Roger, Sarge!

831
01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:33.959
Hop in!

832
01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:53.354
Wait!

833
01:18:54.313 --> 01:18:56.482
Let's go, Thomas. Get in!

834
01:19:20.256 --> 01:19:21.423
Which way?

835
01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:29.431
-That way, I think!
-Not so fucking loud.

836
01:20:03.215 --> 01:20:04.550
Nice donkey.

837
01:20:23.152 --> 01:20:24.570
Rangers?

838
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:26.071
Who?

839
01:20:26.905 --> 01:20:30.451
It's Yurek! You fucking assholes!

840
01:20:30.617 --> 01:20:32.036
Fuck!

841
01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:34.788
Dude, we almost fucking killed you!

842
01:20:35.039 --> 01:20:38.125
-Come to us!
-Fuck you, come to me.

843
01:20:50.596 --> 01:20:51.930
Sorry, Sarge!

844
01:20:52.097 --> 01:20:54.016
Dude, where the fuck have you been?

845
01:20:54.099 --> 01:20:55.934
Never mind, you brought NOD, right?

846
01:20:56.018 --> 01:20:58.354
No, I didn't and you want to know why?

847
01:20:58.437 --> 01:21:01.774
Because you said: "You won't need that,
we'll be back in a half-hour."

848
01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:03.442
Well, I wasn't saying it to you.

849
01:21:03.484 --> 01:21:05.486
Nelson, cover this way.

850
01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:07.446
We'll need night vision.

851
01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:09.948
What's the matter with you?

852
01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:13.077
Oh, he's deaf. It's my fault.

853
01:21:13.369 --> 01:21:15.621
-We need to get out of here!
-That way.

854
01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:19.375
We can't be far from the crash.
Which way?

855
01:21:20.042 --> 01:21:21.794
I thought you might know.

856
01:21:22.503 --> 01:21:23.962
Let's move out.

857
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:32.096
Nelson, Twombly? Come in. Over.

858
01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:37.351
Nelson, Twombly, this is Galentine.
We need a position of the convoy. Over.

859
01:21:38.394 --> 01:21:40.646
I can't raise them, Sergeant.

860
01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:43.565
Sir, let's get the fuck out of here and evac!

861
01:21:45.025 --> 01:21:48.112
-Let's move out.
-Back to the stronghold!

862
01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:49.321
Come on!

863
01:21:51.615 --> 01:21:54.827
Ground forces have occupied
several buildings along Marehan Road...

864
01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:56.620
...but they're all spread out.

865
01:21:56.662 --> 01:22:01.125
Eversmann's Chalk Four has set up
a perimeter around Wolcott's crash site.

866
01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:03.669
DiTomasso is in the adjacent structure.

867
01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:08.006
Captain Steele and about 40 men, Rangers,
are here, a couple blocks away.

868
01:22:08.048 --> 01:22:09.591
They're banged up pretty bad.

869
01:22:09.675 --> 01:22:14.513
He set up a casualty collection point,
I don't think they'll be able to move.

870
01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:17.266
Sergeant Sanderson
and a small Delta team...

871
01:22:17.349 --> 01:22:21.186
...are moving from Steele's position
to the crash site as we speak.

872
01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:33.365
Draw off fire!

873
01:22:33.449 --> 01:22:36.535
When this asshole stops to reload,
cover me!

874
01:22:36.702 --> 01:22:38.162
-Go!
-Sir.

875
01:22:41.665 --> 01:22:42.624
Again!

876
01:22:47.713 --> 01:22:49.214
Loading!

877
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:53.051
Keep going!

878
01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:55.554
I'm jammed!

879
01:22:56.722 --> 01:22:58.182
I got it!

880
01:22:59.391 --> 01:23:01.185
No, shit!

881
01:23:13.739 --> 01:23:15.032
RPG!

882
01:23:29.963 --> 01:23:32.549
You all right? You okay?

883
01:23:32.716 --> 01:23:35.677
Yeah. I can hear bells ringing.

884
01:23:37.262 --> 01:23:39.515
Come on! Come on!

885
01:23:41.266 --> 01:23:42.267
Go!

886
01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:52.444
A crowd is advancing six,
seven blocks from the crash.

887
01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:54.821
Shughart and Gordon
again request permission...

888
01:23:54.905 --> 01:23:58.325
...to secure until convoy arrives. Over.

889
01:23:58.534 --> 01:24:01.620
General, crowds are in the hundreds now.

890
01:24:01.828 --> 01:24:05.290
From where they are,
they can see things clearer than any of us.

891
01:24:05.415 --> 01:24:07.292
They know what they're asking.

892
01:24:07.501 --> 01:24:08.961
Let me talk to them.

893
01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:10.295
This is Garrison.

894
01:24:10.337 --> 01:24:14.633
I want to make sure that you understand
what you're asking, so say it out loud.

895
01:24:16.677 --> 01:24:20.681
We're asking to go in and set up
a perimeter until ground support arrives.

896
01:24:21.014 --> 01:24:25.185
You realize that I cannot tell you
when that might be, it could take a while.

897
01:24:26.103 --> 01:24:28.647
-Roger that.
-You still want to go in there?

898
01:24:28.981 --> 01:24:29.773
Yes, sir.

899
01:24:33.777 --> 01:24:35.404
-Colonel Harrell?
-Yes, General?

900
01:24:35.487 --> 01:24:36.530
It's your call.

901
01:24:37.698 --> 01:24:39.199
Roger that.

902
01:24:40.993 --> 01:24:43.161
Goffena, put them in.

903
01:24:57.092 --> 01:24:58.844
Motherfucker. Motherfucker.

904
01:25:04.016 --> 01:25:05.017
RPG!

905
01:25:14.901 --> 01:25:16.528
Set up your perimeter!

906
01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:25.954
There's a fucking rocket in him, sir!

907
01:25:26.038 --> 01:25:29.875
Othic, calm down, goddamn it!
There's live ordnance, now get out!

908
01:25:31.209 --> 01:25:33.045
Son of a bitch.

909
01:25:34.546 --> 01:25:37.716
All right, lift him up!
Lift him up! Easy, easy!

910
01:25:38.008 --> 01:25:41.094
All right, get him in there! Good, good!
Easy, easy!

911
01:25:42.304 --> 01:25:43.847
Get in that truck and drive.

912
01:25:43.889 --> 01:25:45.974
-But I'm shot, Colonel.
-Everybody's shot.

913
01:25:46.058 --> 01:25:48.143
We need the prisoners! Let's go!

914
01:25:49.227 --> 01:25:52.731
Surveillance says to take Hawlwadig,
then go straight.

915
01:25:52.939 --> 01:25:57.235
McKnight, we need you to turn around
and head back to Hawlwadig.

916
01:25:57.402 --> 01:25:59.655
You're shitting me!
We just came through there!

917
01:25:59.738 --> 01:26:01.490
There must be a better route!

918
01:26:01.573 --> 01:26:06.745
That's the info I'm getting from JOC,
you need to turn around and head back.

919
01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:10.040
Roger that. Roger that.

920
01:26:10.499 --> 01:26:13.377
I cannot believe this shit!
Turn us around, Maddox.

921
01:26:13.418 --> 01:26:15.420
They're trying to get us fucking killed!

922
01:26:15.462 --> 01:26:17.089
Just get it over with! Drive!

923
01:26:17.130 --> 01:26:18.131
Goddamn!

924
01:26:18.423 --> 01:26:20.759
Get us out of here, goddamn it, drive!

925
01:26:28.433 --> 01:26:29.893
Keep your foot on the gas!

926
01:26:29.935 --> 01:26:32.187
Keep your foot on the gas!

927
01:26:43.699 --> 01:26:44.783
Fuck!

928
01:26:47.703 --> 01:26:48.704
Shit.

929
01:27:04.136 --> 01:27:06.930
C-2, Shughart and Gordon
are on the deck. Over.

930
01:27:07.139 --> 01:27:08.098
Roger.

931
01:27:34.166 --> 01:27:35.751
Friendlies!

932
01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:39.171
God, it's good to see you!

933
01:27:39.212 --> 01:27:41.173
It's good to see you. How bad?

934
01:27:41.256 --> 01:27:44.176
My leg's broken
and my back feels kind of weird.

935
01:27:44.301 --> 01:27:46.386
We've got to get you out of here.

936
01:27:47.345 --> 01:27:49.181
I'm pulling him out! Cover!

937
01:27:52.601 --> 01:27:53.602
Wait, I--

938
01:28:02.152 --> 01:28:03.403
I'm putting you down.

939
01:28:03.653 --> 01:28:06.573
C-2, we're at the 64 crash site,
securing perimeter.

940
01:28:06.656 --> 01:28:08.241
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'm good.

941
01:28:08.325 --> 01:28:09.743
You're locked and loaded.

942
01:28:09.826 --> 01:28:13.538
Any skinnies come around these corners,
you watch our backs.

943
01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:16.291
-Where's the rescue squad?
-We're it.

944
01:28:22.005 --> 01:28:25.091
All right, stop, stop, Maddox. Stop.

945
01:28:26.092 --> 01:28:27.552
Son of a bitch.

946
01:28:27.677 --> 01:28:30.555
Romeo 64, we're back where we started.

947
01:28:30.764 --> 01:28:33.475
I'm low on ammo,
I got many wounded including me...

948
01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:35.519
...vehicles that are barely running.

949
01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:38.522
Okay, Danny,
I need a no-b.s. assessment here.

950
01:28:38.939 --> 01:28:41.066
Can you get to the crash site?

951
01:28:41.817 --> 01:28:44.402
Colonel, I can't see shit.

952
01:28:48.490 --> 01:28:49.407
Negative.

953
01:28:49.449 --> 01:28:52.536
With the amount of wounded we have,
we'd do more harm than good.

954
01:28:52.577 --> 01:28:56.581
We need to come back to base, rearm
and regroup and then we can go back out.

955
01:28:56.623 --> 01:28:57.624
Roger.

956
01:28:59.459 --> 01:29:02.754
C-2, bring them back.
Get them out of there.

957
01:29:04.214 --> 01:29:05.799
Roger. Return to base.

958
01:29:06.591 --> 01:29:07.968
We're going home!

959
01:29:08.176 --> 01:29:10.178
Let's go. Left.

960
01:29:23.108 --> 01:29:26.403
Roger that. Understand.
Convoy returning to base.

961
01:29:31.658 --> 01:29:33.785
-What's up?
-They're sending them back.

962
01:29:33.827 --> 01:29:35.495
The convoy's headed back to base camp.

963
01:29:35.579 --> 01:29:37.747
Oh, now that makes sense, don't it?

964
01:29:38.248 --> 01:29:42.294
We need to exfil the wounded now
and get out of here before it's too late!

965
01:29:42.627 --> 01:29:46.172
If Colonel McKnight went back to base,
then he had a good reason.

966
01:29:46.339 --> 01:29:47.799
It changes nothing.

967
01:29:48.008 --> 01:29:49.426
All right, listen up.

968
01:29:49.467 --> 01:29:53.471
We're going to hold the perimeter
and we're going to hold the strong point.

969
01:29:54.264 --> 01:29:57.517
Conserve your ammo.
Only shoot at what you can hit.

970
01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:01.146
The convoy is going to come.

971
01:30:02.522 --> 01:30:03.523
We're going to get home.

972
01:30:15.994 --> 01:30:16.995
Loading!

973
01:30:25.503 --> 01:30:26.838
Loading!

974
01:30:27.339 --> 01:30:29.174
Randy, I need a pistol mag!

975
01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:43.521
Loading!

976
01:30:47.275 --> 01:30:48.693
Randy, last mag!

977
01:30:52.197 --> 01:30:53.198
Gordy!

978
01:30:56.952 --> 01:30:57.953
Fuck!

979
01:31:11.424 --> 01:31:13.635
Gordy is gone, man. I'll be outside.

980
01:31:14.219 --> 01:31:15.345
Good luck.

981
01:31:36.741 --> 01:31:39.619
We need the 10th Mountain in there.
Everything they got.

982
01:31:39.703 --> 01:31:42.831
Pakistanis, Malays,
I want their tanks and APCs.

983
01:31:43.456 --> 01:31:44.874
They don't know we've gone in.

984
01:31:44.916 --> 01:31:49.379
We have stirred up a hornet's nest here.
We're fighting the entire city.

985
01:31:49.879 --> 01:31:54.551
I want every vehicle possible that's got
4 wheels and armor. Get everything.

986
01:31:54.759 --> 01:31:58.054
Once they've assembled, we'll move
our men out of the hostile area...

987
01:31:58.096 --> 01:32:00.724
...and back to the Pakistani Stadium,
the safe zone.

988
01:32:00.765 --> 01:32:03.309
-Now, let's go.
-Roger that.

989
01:34:40.175 --> 01:34:42.802
On your knees! Get down! Get down!

990
01:34:47.432 --> 01:34:51.394
Stay with me.
You just got a bullet in the leg.

991
01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:58.860
See where those tires are burning?
All that black smoke?

992
01:34:58.943 --> 01:35:02.447
Roger. I can see it,
but I can't get there. Over.

993
01:35:02.655 --> 01:35:05.742
Go 100 meters past it. That's the crash.

994
01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:08.077
Negative. You don't understand.

995
01:35:08.244 --> 01:35:12.790
It's roadblock after roadblock.
You have to find us another route. Over.

996
01:35:13.416 --> 01:35:17.045
There ain't one. The only other route is
all the way around the city.

997
01:35:17.128 --> 01:35:18.213
Roger that.

998
01:35:18.296 --> 01:35:20.798
Kilo 64, this is Kilo 11.

999
01:35:21.007 --> 01:35:25.470
Request permission to move
to crash site number two on foot. Over.

1000
01:35:26.387 --> 01:35:28.431
Green light, Kilo 11.

1001
01:35:28.473 --> 01:35:30.892
Stop the vehicle. Let me out.

1002
01:36:15.979 --> 01:36:19.565
After I'm finished with this,
I'll whip you boys up some margaritas.

1003
01:36:19.649 --> 01:36:22.527
The usual. Blended, no salt.

1004
01:36:29.701 --> 01:36:32.912
This is Kilo 12.
We've got to change our position. Over.

1005
01:36:46.718 --> 01:36:48.428
Eversmann, come in.

1006
01:36:48.678 --> 01:36:49.762
Eversmann.

1007
01:36:52.223 --> 01:36:54.559
-Roger who is this?
-Sanderson.

1008
01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:59.063
Do not-- I say again, do not fire to the
east. We are coming to you.

1009
01:37:00.523 --> 01:37:01.649
Understood.

1010
01:37:01.899 --> 01:37:04.360
DiTomasso and his men
are on the southeast corner.

1011
01:37:04.402 --> 01:37:06.779
We need you on the northeast building.

1012
01:37:06.863 --> 01:37:08.323
Roger. We'll take it.

1013
01:37:08.906 --> 01:37:11.159
Watch out for skinnies.
They're on the rooftops.

1014
01:37:11.242 --> 01:37:13.745
They're in prayer but not for much longer.

1015
01:37:17.206 --> 01:37:19.000
Hold your fire to the east.

1016
01:37:41.105 --> 01:37:42.774
Eversmann? It's Yurek.

1017
01:37:43.149 --> 01:37:45.568
I got Nelson and Twombly with me.

1018
01:37:45.943 --> 01:37:48.738
We got the chopper in sight.
Where are you?

1019
01:37:48.946 --> 01:37:52.116
We're on the southwest corner.
Where have you been? Are you okay?

1020
01:37:52.158 --> 01:37:53.034
Yeah.

1021
01:37:54.619 --> 01:37:56.746
Hold your fire. We're coming in.

1022
01:38:01.542 --> 01:38:02.627
We got to go.

1023
01:38:02.668 --> 01:38:05.630
Shawn, listen!
Sergeant Yurek's going to run first.

1024
01:38:05.797 --> 01:38:09.759
When he gets across the street,
he'll turn around and cover you as you run.

1025
01:38:09.801 --> 01:38:13.971
Listen closely. When you get there,
you'll turn around and cover me, okay?

1026
01:38:15.598 --> 01:38:17.934
You won't just run
to Eversmann's position.

1027
01:38:17.975 --> 01:38:20.812
You're going to stop
and you are going to cover me.

1028
01:38:21.312 --> 01:38:23.481
It's important you understand that.

1029
01:38:23.981 --> 01:38:25.316
Okay, you ready?

1030
01:38:26.150 --> 01:38:27.485
Yeah, I guess.

1031
01:38:33.074 --> 01:38:34.659
-Don't forget.
-What?

1032
01:38:35.326 --> 01:38:36.536
Don't forget.

1033
01:38:50.049 --> 01:38:53.428
I got them in my sight, Sarg'nt.
They're coming up on the west gate.

1034
01:38:53.511 --> 01:38:54.637
I see them.

1035
01:38:57.557 --> 01:38:58.850
Let's move out.

1036
01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:03.020
Can you cover us, Sergeant?

1037
01:39:03.271 --> 01:39:04.605
We got you.

1038
01:39:11.863 --> 01:39:13.239
Nelson!

1039
01:39:20.037 --> 01:39:21.038
Fuck!

1040
01:39:29.547 --> 01:39:30.548
Twombly!

1041
01:39:32.383 --> 01:39:33.509
Smith! No!

1042
01:39:33.634 --> 01:39:34.886
You all right?

1043
01:39:38.222 --> 01:39:39.599
Get it off of me!

1044
01:39:40.391 --> 01:39:41.767
Get it off!

1045
01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:44.729
Come on, man. Come on.

1046
01:39:45.897 --> 01:39:48.816
Doc! Need some help with Smith here!

1047
01:39:57.241 --> 01:39:58.534
My leg! My leg!

1048
01:39:58.576 --> 01:40:00.286
Come on, Jamie, I got you!

1049
01:40:07.376 --> 01:40:09.420
Up, one, two, three.

1050
01:40:10.755 --> 01:40:13.424
-You're all right.
-I need some pressure on this wound.

1051
01:40:13.466 --> 01:40:14.550
My right thigh!

1052
01:40:14.592 --> 01:40:16.302
Pressure, yeah.

1053
01:40:16.469 --> 01:40:18.804
-Are my balls okay?
-You still have your balls.

1054
01:40:18.888 --> 01:40:19.972
I need more men in here.

1055
01:40:20.056 --> 01:40:22.642
Twombly! Nelson!

1056
01:40:22.725 --> 01:40:25.770
-Put him down.
-Oh, man, that really....

1057
01:40:27.104 --> 01:40:29.357
- It really hurts!
-Direct pressure on that.

1058
01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:30.942
It's okay, it's okay.

1059
01:40:31.484 --> 01:40:33.861
-Let me see it!
-All right.

1060
01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:36.614
All right, let me get a look at that.

1061
01:40:36.989 --> 01:40:38.407
Oh, shit!

1062
01:40:38.616 --> 01:40:39.825
Oh, fuck!

1063
01:40:40.034 --> 01:40:42.453
-What the fuck was that?
-It's all right.

1064
01:40:42.495 --> 01:40:44.664
Hold that down. I need a medivac now.

1065
01:40:44.747 --> 01:40:46.123
Fuck. Galentine!

1066
01:40:46.332 --> 01:40:47.333
It's all right.

1067
01:40:47.416 --> 01:40:49.210
Galentine! Get me Captain Steele!

1068
01:40:50.127 --> 01:40:53.172
-Sarg'nt Ruiz, how you doing?
-Juliet 64, come in. Over.

1069
01:40:53.256 --> 01:40:57.134
They're not going to come and get us.
They're not going to come for us.

1070
01:40:57.218 --> 01:41:00.304
I need you to suck it up, Sarg'nt.
I need you to focus.

1071
01:41:00.346 --> 01:41:02.765
-Can you do that?
-Juliet 64, come in. Over.

1072
01:41:02.807 --> 01:41:04.725
Now, can you hold your weapon?

1073
01:41:05.101 --> 01:41:06.102
Yes, sir.

1074
01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:10.314
Anybody comes through that door
gets two in the chest and one in the head.

1075
01:41:10.648 --> 01:41:14.110
-You understand?
-I'm still in the fight, sir.

1076
01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:17.321
Captain Steele,
I need a medivac in here now!

1077
01:41:17.488 --> 01:41:19.991
-Corporal Smith has been hit!
-Hold on, 25.

1078
01:41:20.324 --> 01:41:21.784
Still in the fight.

1079
01:41:21.826 --> 01:41:23.327
He's hurt pretty bad.

1080
01:41:23.369 --> 01:41:27.123
25, we got wounded too. You'll have to
maintain your situation, over.

1081
01:41:27.164 --> 01:41:29.750
If he doesn't get help in a half-hour,
he's in trouble!

1082
01:41:30.501 --> 01:41:32.628
C-2, this is 64.

1083
01:41:32.837 --> 01:41:37.049
Requesting a medivac for a critically
wounded at Chalk Four's location. Over.

1084
01:41:37.133 --> 01:41:40.011
Command, Chalk Four
is requesting medivac.

1085
01:41:40.177 --> 01:41:42.513
Can't risk it. It's still too hot.

1086
01:41:43.014 --> 01:41:47.852
Captain, we cannot send in medivac
at this time. Sit tight. Over.

1087
01:41:48.185 --> 01:41:52.023
25, this is 64. Negative on the medivac.
It's not possible.

1088
01:41:52.231 --> 01:41:56.027
JOC cannot risk another bird.
You'll just have to hold on.

1089
01:42:02.575 --> 01:42:04.035
All right. I got him.

1090
01:42:04.076 --> 01:42:06.537
I want direct pressure on the wound.

1091
01:42:08.372 --> 01:42:10.207
It's going to be all right.

1092
01:42:54.752 --> 01:42:57.922
This is Kilo 11.
I'm at the Durant crash site.

1093
01:42:58.089 --> 01:42:59.507
Roger that.

1094
01:43:21.112 --> 01:43:22.863
Crash site two secured.

1095
01:43:23.114 --> 01:43:25.449
Lieutenant Colonel Cribbs for you, sir.

1096
01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:26.826
Cribbs?

1097
01:43:28.828 --> 01:43:31.122
-They're still debating the route.
-How long?

1098
01:43:31.288 --> 01:43:32.915
At least a couple of hours.

1099
01:43:33.082 --> 01:43:34.750
We haven't got that long, Joe.

1100
01:43:34.792 --> 01:43:39.422
Pakistani General says, since
we didn't deign to inform him of the raid...

1101
01:43:39.630 --> 01:43:43.467
...it'll take some time to mobilize
the 10th Mountain and 100 vehicles.

1102
01:43:43.509 --> 01:43:45.511
You tell the general this:

1103
01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:48.639
I understand,
but it is my duty to remind him...

1104
01:43:48.806 --> 01:43:52.893
...that my men are surrounded
by thousands of armed Somali militia.

1105
01:43:53.102 --> 01:43:58.357
It's imperative that we move them out
of the hostile area and into the safe zone.

1106
01:43:58.566 --> 01:44:00.109
I need his help now.

1107
01:44:01.110 --> 01:44:02.319
Yes, sir.

1108
01:44:07.450 --> 01:44:08.659
Durant.

1109
01:44:09.368 --> 01:44:11.829
Michael Durant.

1110
01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:13.581
Yes.

1111
01:44:14.039 --> 01:44:16.459
You are the Ranger who kills my people?

1112
01:44:16.667 --> 01:44:20.045
I'm not a Ranger. I'm a pilot.

1113
01:44:24.008 --> 01:44:25.301
That's right.

1114
01:44:25.968 --> 01:44:28.971
None of you Americans smoke anymore.

1115
01:44:32.183 --> 01:44:36.812
You all live long, dull, uninteresting lives.

1116
01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:40.524
What do you want with me?

1117
01:44:41.358 --> 01:44:43.110
You have taken hostages.

1118
01:44:44.111 --> 01:44:45.696
We have you.

1119
01:44:45.905 --> 01:44:49.033
My government
will never negotiate for me.

1120
01:44:49.533 --> 01:44:54.121
Then perhaps you and I can negotiate, huh?

1121
01:44:55.581 --> 01:44:58.125
Soldier to soldier.

1122
01:45:04.048 --> 01:45:05.883
I'm not in charge.

1123
01:45:09.136 --> 01:45:13.557
Course not. You have the power to Kill,
but not negotiate.

1124
01:45:14.058 --> 01:45:16.936
In Somalia, killing is negotiation.

1125
01:45:18.521 --> 01:45:21.899
Do you really think
if you get General Aidid...

1126
01:45:22.066 --> 01:45:25.444
...we will simply put down our weapons...

1127
01:45:25.569 --> 01:45:28.572
...and adopt American democracy?

1128
01:45:29.031 --> 01:45:30.825
That the killing will stop?

1129
01:45:31.242 --> 01:45:35.287
We know this:
Without victory, there can be no peace.

1130
01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:38.499
There will always be killing, you see?

1131
01:45:38.958 --> 01:45:41.168
This is how things are in our world.

1132
01:45:54.014 --> 01:45:57.685
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.

1133
01:45:59.812 --> 01:46:03.274
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.

1134
01:46:05.985 --> 01:46:08.863
You got to take over from me. Both hands.

1135
01:46:16.579 --> 01:46:19.790
It's the femoral artery, but I can't see it.

1136
01:46:19.999 --> 01:46:23.460
Which means that
it's retracted up into the pelvis.

1137
01:46:23.669 --> 01:46:27.965
I have to find it and clamp it.
It's the only way to stop the bleeding.

1138
01:46:28.173 --> 01:46:30.301
I got no more IVs.

1139
01:46:31.552 --> 01:46:34.471
So, I'm going to need you to assist. Okay?

1140
01:46:34.597 --> 01:46:36.223
Yeah, yeah.

1141
01:46:37.141 --> 01:46:40.519
Now listen, Jamie.
I got to do something, it's going to hurt.

1142
01:46:41.812 --> 01:46:45.482
I got to cause you more pain,
but I have to do it to help you.

1143
01:46:45.691 --> 01:46:47.234
All right, you understand?

1144
01:46:47.318 --> 01:46:49.320
-Morphine.
- I can't.

1145
01:46:49.486 --> 01:46:52.114
It'll lower your heart rate too far.
I'm sorry.

1146
01:46:52.156 --> 01:46:54.491
Twombly, why don't you take his hands?

1147
01:46:58.996 --> 01:47:01.916
Hold the wound open,
keep pressure on the top of the leg.

1148
01:47:01.999 --> 01:47:04.168
Yurek, take the feet and a flashlight.

1149
01:47:04.585 --> 01:47:05.711
On my count.

1150
01:47:05.794 --> 01:47:07.796
All right, Jamie. All right.

1151
01:47:10.049 --> 01:47:12.217
One. Two.

1152
01:47:13.177 --> 01:47:14.219
Three.

1153
01:47:21.936 --> 01:47:24.355
Wait, wait. Okay. I feel it.

1154
01:47:25.022 --> 01:47:26.357
I feel the pulse.

1155
01:47:27.942 --> 01:47:29.276
I got it. I got it.

1156
01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:30.945
I got it, yeah. I got it.

1157
01:47:31.028 --> 01:47:32.613
- I got it.
-You got it?

1158
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:34.031
Clamp?

1159
01:47:36.450 --> 01:47:37.826
I got it clamped.

1160
01:47:37.952 --> 01:47:39.161
-Hold it.
-Got it.

1161
01:47:39.203 --> 01:47:40.496
Here, grab it.

1162
01:47:41.163 --> 01:47:42.873
-It's tearing.
- I got it.

1163
01:47:43.123 --> 01:47:45.000
-Doc, it's going back in!
-Hold it!

1164
01:47:45.042 --> 01:47:46.293
It's tearing!

1165
01:47:46.627 --> 01:47:49.588
-Okay. Get out. Hold the wound.
-Okay, I'm holding.

1166
01:47:50.839 --> 01:47:52.132
Move your hand.

1167
01:48:03.352 --> 01:48:04.561
What?

1168
01:48:23.706 --> 01:48:24.707
Fix it?

1169
01:48:28.293 --> 01:48:30.754
Yeah, yeah. We got it.

1170
01:48:46.395 --> 01:48:48.188
What the hell are you doing?

1171
01:48:48.272 --> 01:48:52.651
It's all in the grind, Sarg'nt.
Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

1172
01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:55.529
Grimesy, you are squared away.

1173
01:49:11.837 --> 01:49:15.799
Sarg'nt, how would you
like a nice hot cup of Joe?

1174
01:49:17.634 --> 01:49:19.219
Gold Coast blend.

1175
01:49:19.428 --> 01:49:22.347
Sit down.
I want to take a look at that foot.

1176
01:49:22.973 --> 01:49:25.059
-No, it's not a problem.
-Come on.

1177
01:49:31.482 --> 01:49:34.610
-Where the hell did they find you?
-Behind a desk.

1178
01:49:36.111 --> 01:49:39.156
No, really. What, you think I'm kidding?

1179
01:49:42.826 --> 01:49:44.620
-Is anybody hit?
-We're good!

1180
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.168
You all right?

1181
01:49:51.210 --> 01:49:52.211
Yeah!

1182
01:49:52.419 --> 01:49:53.879
Is everybody all right?

1183
01:49:53.962 --> 01:49:55.005
Yeah!

1184
01:50:09.019 --> 01:50:10.187
Incoming!

1185
01:51:15.752 --> 01:51:17.754
DiTomasso's hit! Pull him out!

1186
01:51:51.246 --> 01:51:52.956
Ranger here. This is Kilo 11.

1187
01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:56.293
Chalk Four. We're at the southeast corner
of the crash. Who's this?

1188
01:51:56.335 --> 01:51:58.337
This is Hoot.
I'm coming with three friendlies.

1189
01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:00.088
I need cover fire. Over.

1190
01:52:00.130 --> 01:52:03.091
Roger, Kilo 11. Hold your fire!
Deltas coming in.

1191
01:52:03.133 --> 01:52:05.177
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

1192
01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:14.519
Ground personnel will have to mark
target positions with infrared strobes.

1193
01:52:15.187 --> 01:52:18.982
Get little birds on strafing runs
and keep them going all night long.

1194
01:52:19.066 --> 01:52:21.318
If we don't hold back this city...

1195
01:52:22.027 --> 01:52:25.030
...we'll have a 100 caskets
to fill by morning.

1196
01:52:25.239 --> 01:52:26.490
Yes, sir.

1197
01:52:26.657 --> 01:52:29.451
Colonel Harrell,
ground personnel at crash site one...

1198
01:52:29.493 --> 01:52:33.997
...will have to mark the target
with infrared strobes to prep for air strike.

1199
01:52:39.294 --> 01:52:40.504
McKnight.

1200
01:52:44.591 --> 01:52:48.178
Between the 10th Mountain and U.N.,
we got enough personnel, okay?

1201
01:52:49.513 --> 01:52:52.349
Danny, you guys do not have to
go back out again.

1202
01:53:12.494 --> 01:53:15.038
I can't die here, man.

1203
01:53:16.206 --> 01:53:20.335
You're not going to die, all right?
You're not going to die.

1204
01:53:21.211 --> 01:53:22.713
I'm sorry.

1205
01:53:22.879 --> 01:53:26.174
You don't have anything to be sorry for.

1206
01:53:26.341 --> 01:53:29.511
You saved Twombly. You did perfect.

1207
01:53:30.721 --> 01:53:32.180
You okay, Twombs?

1208
01:53:32.723 --> 01:53:34.558
Yeah, I'm okay, Jamie.

1209
01:53:35.892 --> 01:53:38.103
You did what you were trained to do.

1210
01:53:39.062 --> 01:53:40.897
You should be proud of that.

1211
01:53:44.026 --> 01:53:45.360
Be proud of that.

1212
01:53:46.194 --> 01:53:48.071
-Ev?
-Yeah.

1213
01:53:50.032 --> 01:53:51.366
Do me a favor.

1214
01:53:54.411 --> 01:53:59.374
You tell my parents
that I fought well today.

1215
01:54:06.798 --> 01:54:08.675
And that I fought hard.

1216
01:54:10.635 --> 01:54:13.096
You're going to tell them yourself, okay?

1217
01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:14.514
Do you hear me?

1218
01:54:16.308 --> 01:54:17.392
All right?

1219
01:54:19.519 --> 01:54:22.647
-Are the humvees here?
-They're coming, Jamie.

1220
01:54:23.148 --> 01:54:24.983
They're coming.

1221
01:54:25.150 --> 01:54:27.444
You just got to hang in there a little bit.

1222
01:54:27.486 --> 01:54:29.988
-You hold on for just a little bit.
- can.

1223
01:54:30.155 --> 01:54:31.323
I can.

1224
01:54:32.699 --> 01:54:34.159
It's nothing.

1225
01:54:35.410 --> 01:54:36.828
It's nothing.

1226
01:54:37.871 --> 01:54:38.997
It's nothing.

1227
01:54:39.081 --> 01:54:41.416
-It's nothing.
-It's nothing.

1228
01:54:42.334 --> 01:54:43.502
Nothing.

1229
01:54:51.176 --> 01:54:52.177
Oh, shit.

1230
01:54:53.178 --> 01:54:54.513
Hold the wound.

1231
01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:22.833
Doc.

1232
01:55:25.710 --> 01:55:26.753
Doc.

1233
01:55:43.854 --> 01:55:45.188
It's okay.

1234
01:56:11.798 --> 01:56:13.258
What are you doing?

1235
01:56:16.636 --> 01:56:18.388
We need the ammo.

1236
01:56:26.646 --> 01:56:28.440
You did all you could here.

1237
01:56:28.982 --> 01:56:31.234
They should've sent a medivac.

1238
01:56:31.735 --> 01:56:35.405
Right now we'd be out there
defending another crashed chopper.

1239
01:56:35.655 --> 01:56:38.158
More men would get torn up.

1240
01:56:41.161 --> 01:56:42.496
Maybe.

1241
01:56:42.996 --> 01:56:45.874
See, you're thinking. Don't.

1242
01:56:45.957 --> 01:56:49.002
Because, Sergeant, you can't control
who gets hit or who doesn't.

1243
01:56:49.085 --> 01:56:51.838
Who falls out of a chopper or why.

1244
01:56:52.047 --> 01:56:54.674
It ain't up to you. It's just war.

1245
01:56:56.676 --> 01:56:58.678
Yeah, well, Smith's still dead.

1246
01:57:00.347 --> 01:57:04.935
-This all happened because Blackburn fell.
-Should have, could have, don't matter.

1247
01:57:05.101 --> 01:57:08.897
You'll get plenty of time
to think about all that later. Believe me.

1248
01:57:12.651 --> 01:57:15.779
Sergeant, you got your men this far.

1249
01:57:16.613 --> 01:57:18.323
You did it right today.

1250
01:57:18.532 --> 01:57:21.993
You need to start thinking about
getting these men out of here.

1251
01:57:28.416 --> 01:57:30.293
Well, shall we?

1252
01:57:39.052 --> 01:57:42.138
I need four guys in this corner now!

1253
01:57:48.311 --> 01:57:49.938
RPG!

1254
01:57:53.817 --> 01:57:56.319
This is Barber 52 in position for gun run.

1255
01:57:56.403 --> 01:57:58.530
Jesus Christ. Look at that.

1256
01:57:59.239 --> 01:58:02.284
This is 25! I can see you.
You're right above me.

1257
01:58:02.450 --> 01:58:05.870
Eversmann, I can't tell who's who
down there. Too much activity.

1258
01:58:05.954 --> 01:58:08.456
I'll mark the target with a strobe! Over.

1259
01:58:08.665 --> 01:58:09.833
Roger that.

1260
01:58:21.636 --> 01:58:22.804
You see it?

1261
01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:26.725
Nah, I can't see shit.

1262
01:58:27.684 --> 01:58:30.562
-I'm putting it on the roof.
-You're going to need help!

1263
01:58:30.645 --> 01:58:31.646
Cover me.

1264
01:58:32.856 --> 01:58:36.610
Okay, guys, we're going to lay down
some cover fire for him on three!

1265
01:58:36.818 --> 01:58:37.819
Ready?

1266
01:58:37.986 --> 01:58:38.987
One.

1267
01:58:39.029 --> 01:58:40.155
Two.

1268
01:58:40.322 --> 01:58:42.032
Three. Go!

1269
01:59:14.606 --> 01:59:18.068
I got your position. I got the target.
We're inbound and hot.

1270
01:59:42.634 --> 01:59:47.305
C-2, miniguns dry. Request permission
to return to base. Rearm. Over.

1271
01:59:47.472 --> 01:59:50.308
Roger that. Second team inbound.
Your station.

1272
01:59:50.475 --> 01:59:52.686
On your location, four minutes.

1273
02:00:00.819 --> 02:00:03.905
All right, they're here.
Get the wounded ready to move.

1274
02:00:04.364 --> 02:00:06.783
Lay down some cover fire!

1275
02:00:09.119 --> 02:00:11.246
I thought I heard a noise out here!

1276
02:00:11.287 --> 02:00:14.040
-Load up. We're getting out of here.
-Yes, sir.

1277
02:00:17.210 --> 02:00:21.965
25, this is 64. The rescue column's here
and will be with you in about 5 minutes.

1278
02:00:22.132 --> 02:00:23.883
Prepare your men for exfil.

1279
02:00:23.967 --> 02:00:26.469
Yeah, roger that, sir! Roger that!

1280
02:00:27.178 --> 02:00:30.974
Five minutes! The convoy is going to be
here in five minutes!

1281
02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:53.163
I need a mag! Eversmann, I'm out!

1282
02:00:53.329 --> 02:00:54.664
My last one!

1283
02:01:04.841 --> 02:01:07.010
The convoy is here!

1284
02:01:25.570 --> 02:01:29.115
Sergeant Eversmann.
I heard you guys needed a lift!

1285
02:01:29.365 --> 02:01:31.034
Yes, sir!

1286
02:01:31.201 --> 02:01:33.828
Bring your wounded
and start loading them up!

1287
02:01:41.044 --> 02:01:43.171
Hey, I got you. I got you.

1288
02:01:43.379 --> 02:01:46.090
It's okay. I want to walk.

1289
02:01:46.633 --> 02:01:49.719
Yeah, I would too. Let's go!

1290
02:01:58.895 --> 02:01:59.979
Move!

1291
02:02:03.233 --> 02:02:06.569
We get the pilots' bodies out,
and then we go to the stadium.

1292
02:02:07.237 --> 02:02:09.072
We're running out of room around here.

1293
02:02:09.113 --> 02:02:11.074
Cram into every possible space.

1294
02:02:11.908 --> 02:02:16.913
Okay, 10th Mountain provides security
for armor, walks us out of the hot zone.

1295
02:02:17.121 --> 02:02:18.623
10th Mountain? No.

1296
02:02:18.832 --> 02:02:21.918
Sir, with respect,
my Rangers can provide rear security.

1297
02:02:22.085 --> 02:02:26.256
We'll walk you out of the hot zone,
then we'll jump on the last few vehicles.

1298
02:02:27.257 --> 02:02:28.550
Okay, let's get out of here.

1299
02:02:28.591 --> 02:02:29.801
Let's go.

1300
02:02:30.009 --> 02:02:32.512
-All right, you got him?
-Yeah, come on.

1301
02:02:34.430 --> 02:02:35.807
Come on!

1302
02:02:36.933 --> 02:02:39.936
These things are fucking bullet magnets.
Come on, let's go!

1303
02:02:40.019 --> 02:02:42.438
We go when I'm ordered to, soldier.

1304
02:02:45.316 --> 02:02:46.526
Careful.

1305
02:02:47.110 --> 02:02:49.320
Easy. Go easy.

1306
02:02:52.740 --> 02:02:54.117
Easy.

1307
02:03:04.627 --> 02:03:06.838
Colonel, what is going on down there?

1308
02:03:06.921 --> 02:03:10.133
They're dismantling
the entire cockpit around the body.

1309
02:03:10.300 --> 02:03:13.970
How long is it going to take?
I need an honest, no-shit assessment.

1310
02:03:14.929 --> 02:03:16.306
They can't say!

1311
02:03:18.266 --> 02:03:19.475
Danny...

1312
02:03:20.977 --> 02:03:22.812
...no one gets left behind.

1313
02:03:23.479 --> 02:03:25.315
You understand me, son?

1314
02:03:25.815 --> 02:03:27.275
Yes, General.

1315
02:03:27.942 --> 02:03:29.569
Do what you have to do.

1316
02:03:30.945 --> 02:03:32.196
Roger.

1317
02:03:38.411 --> 02:03:41.080
-Come on. Bring him through.
- I got him.

1318
02:03:41.956 --> 02:03:45.126
-Get all his gear. Get the wounded out.
-Got you, sir!

1319
02:03:50.715 --> 02:03:52.133
-Move!
-Got you!

1320
02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:54.844
Move out! Move out! Let's go!

1321
02:04:04.896 --> 02:04:05.897
Fuck!

1322
02:04:08.733 --> 02:04:10.068
Fire in the hole!

1323
02:04:10.276 --> 02:04:12.111
-Let's go! Move!
-Let's go!

1324
02:04:22.664 --> 02:04:26.042
-Open the hatch! We got men back here!
-No room here! Go on the roof!

1325
02:04:26.125 --> 02:04:27.210
What's going on?

1326
02:04:27.293 --> 02:04:30.296
-The roof?
-I'm not getting on no fucking roof!

1327
02:04:31.255 --> 02:04:32.674
No, no, it's full.

1328
02:04:34.092 --> 02:04:37.387
We're running out. Keep moving.
Use the vehicles as cover.

1329
02:04:39.764 --> 02:04:41.849
Move it! Let's go!

1330
02:04:58.741 --> 02:05:01.285
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.

1331
02:05:03.287 --> 02:05:04.664
-Move!
-Go! Move!

1332
02:05:04.914 --> 02:05:06.249
Go!

1333
02:06:00.845 --> 02:06:03.306
Get down! Get down!

1334
02:06:04.515 --> 02:06:05.808
Get down, lady!

1335
02:06:08.311 --> 02:06:09.645
I'm out of ammo!

1336
02:06:11.022 --> 02:06:13.024
Sanderson, I'm out of ammo!

1337
02:06:18.029 --> 02:06:19.655
Don't you do it.

1338
02:06:20.239 --> 02:06:22.742
-What are you doing?
-Don't you damn do it.

1339
02:06:24.535 --> 02:06:25.912
Kurth, let's go!

1340
02:08:49.764 --> 02:08:51.265
Easy.

1341
02:09:41.148 --> 02:09:42.900
Ah, shit.

1342
02:09:42.984 --> 02:09:46.654
Bullet missed your jugular by
about three millimeters. Don't move.

1343
02:09:48.322 --> 02:09:50.366
Hurry up, hurry up.

1344
02:09:53.703 --> 02:09:57.707
Little short on coffee,
but I got you some tea.

1345
02:10:02.003 --> 02:10:03.629
How you doing, soldier?

1346
02:10:04.839 --> 02:10:06.716
Can't feel a thing.

1347
02:10:16.767 --> 02:10:18.394
Take his pulse.

1348
02:10:51.719 --> 02:10:53.095
Hey, Sarg'nt.

1349
02:10:57.683 --> 02:10:58.684
Captain.

1350
02:10:58.851 --> 02:11:01.854
Lorenzo. How you doing?

1351
02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:09.278
It went in and out, so the medic said
I should be okay in a couple of days.

1352
02:11:09.445 --> 02:11:11.155
That's great news.

1353
02:11:11.781 --> 02:11:13.449
Are we going after them?

1354
02:11:13.574 --> 02:11:16.285
You bet your ass we will.
We got to regroup.

1355
02:11:17.870 --> 02:11:19.789
Don't go out there without me.

1356
02:11:20.790 --> 02:11:24.293
Don't go back out there without me.

1357
02:11:25.044 --> 02:11:26.962
I can still do my job.

1358
02:11:28.714 --> 02:11:31.342
You get some rest now, okay?

1359
02:11:46.482 --> 02:11:47.900
You're going back in?

1360
02:11:49.985 --> 02:11:51.821
There are still men out there.

1361
02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:55.825
Goddamn.

1362
02:12:00.996 --> 02:12:02.289
When I go home...

1363
02:12:03.290 --> 02:12:04.792
...and people ask me:

1364
02:12:04.959 --> 02:12:08.295
"Hey, Hoot, why do you do it, man?

1365
02:12:08.838 --> 02:12:12.675
"Why? You some kind of war junkie?"

1366
02:12:13.509 --> 02:12:15.928
I won't say a goddamn word.

1367
02:12:16.262 --> 02:12:17.513
Why?

1368
02:12:18.139 --> 02:12:19.974
They won't understand.

1369
02:12:21.684 --> 02:12:24.019
They won't understand why we do it.

1370
02:12:25.521 --> 02:12:29.650
They won't understand
it's about the men next to you.

1371
02:12:31.485 --> 02:12:32.820
And that's it.

1372
02:12:34.989 --> 02:12:36.323
That's all it is.

1373
02:12:46.667 --> 02:12:51.046
Don't even think about it, all right?
I'm better on my own.

1374
02:12:56.177 --> 02:12:59.180
We started a whole new week.
It's Monday.

1375
02:13:12.026 --> 02:13:14.195
I was talking to Blackburn the other day...

1376
02:13:14.236 --> 02:13:18.949
...and he asked me, "What changed?
Why are we going home?”

1377
02:13:20.493 --> 02:13:22.828
And I said, "Nothing."

1378
02:13:23.037 --> 02:13:26.957
But that's not true, you know.
I think everything's changed.

1379
02:13:28.375 --> 02:13:29.877
I know I've changed.

1380
02:13:35.633 --> 02:13:38.344
A friend of mine asked me
before I got here....

1381
02:13:38.469 --> 02:13:40.763
It was when we were all shipping out.

1382
02:13:40.888 --> 02:13:42.389
He asked me:

1383
02:13:43.641 --> 02:13:46.393
"Why are you going to fight
somebody else's war?

1384
02:13:47.102 --> 02:13:49.522
"What, do y'all think you're heroes?"

1385
02:13:52.483 --> 02:13:54.902
I didn't know what to say at the time...

1386
02:13:57.821 --> 02:14:00.241
...but if he asked me again, I'd say no.

1387
02:14:02.785 --> 02:14:04.828
I'd say there's no way in hell.

1388
02:14:05.955 --> 02:14:07.957
Nobody asks to be a hero.

1389
02:14:13.295 --> 02:14:15.589
It just sometimes turns out that way.

1390
02:14:19.552 --> 02:14:22.638
I'll talk to your ma and pa
when I get home, okay?

1391
02:15:06.181 --> 02:15:09.893
My love, you are strong
and you will do well in life.

1392
02:15:10.936 --> 02:15:13.397
I love you and my children deeply.

1393
02:15:14.315 --> 02:15:17.818
Today and tomorrow,
let each day grow and grow.

1394
02:15:19.028 --> 02:15:23.198
Keep smiling and never give up,
even when things get you down.

1395
02:15:24.491 --> 02:15:26.910
So, in closing, my love...

1396
02:15:27.286 --> 02:15:31.123
...tonight, tuck my children in bed warmly.

1397
02:15:31.540 --> 02:15:36.170
Tell them I love them.
Then hug them for me...

1398
02:15:36.378 --> 02:15:39.256
...and give them both
a kiss good night for Daddy.
