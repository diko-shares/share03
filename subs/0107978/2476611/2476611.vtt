1
00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:39.560
Imagine an end to crime,

2
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:42.039
an end to poverty.

3
00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:47.799
Imagine two million good jobs
waiting to be filled.

4
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.679
Sounds like a dream,
doesn't it?

5
00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:52.640
Well,

6
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:55.800
sometimes dreams come true.

7
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.600
Delta City.

8
00:00:58.321 --> 00:00:59.879
For Our Children.

9
00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:08.239
This is Media Break.

10
00:01:08.321 --> 00:01:11.080
You give us three minutes
and we'll give you the world.

11
00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:14.040
Good evening, I'm Casey Wong.
Our top story tonight,

12
00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:15.960
Motor City goes Japanese

13
00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:18.160
as the Omni Consumer
Products Corporation

14
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.480
ended months
of speculation today

15
00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:24.600
by announcing its takeover by the
multinational Kanemitsu Corporation.

16
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.799
Come on, honey. Hurry up with your
calculus. It's almost time for bed.

17
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:31.320
Mom, I'm watching Media Break.

18
00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:32.399
As the first
private corporation...

19
00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:33.479
Come on, honey.

20
00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:35.760
...to completely own
and operate a major city.

21
00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:38.120
Company spokesmen
expressed special interest

22
00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:40.319
in the delicate issues
of urban resettlement

23
00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:41.839
and a crime wave in Detroit

24
00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:44.680
that many citizens
are calling a war zone.

25
00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:50.800
But, as usual,
OCP has an answer.

26
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:54.840
Meet the Rehabs,
urban rehabilitation officers.

27
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.440
From the blazing fields
of the Amazon War,

28
00:01:57.521 --> 00:02:00.359
comes state-of-the-art
urban pacification.

29
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.600
We're here to help
the people,

30
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.840
to augment
the police force,

31
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.320
and deal with
the gang problem.

32
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:07.560
What about reports
you're actually rousting people

33
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.040
from their homes to make way
for construction of Delta City.

34
00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:13.200
Nikko, you heard
your mom. Go on.

35
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.560
Oh, man.

36
00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:19.760
What about the homeless?

37
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.840
What a gyp.

38
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.640
A lot of buildings have
to come down before Delta can go up.

39
00:02:23.721 --> 00:02:27.280
So, I won't deny we're serving
an eviction notice or two,

40
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.360
but most of these people have
already taken their urine tests

41
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:31.919
and placement exams,

42
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:34.040
they've got new jobs
waiting for them,

43
00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:37.720
we're just helping them make
the transition. That's all.

44
00:02:38.161 --> 00:02:40.080
We're cops, nothing more.

45
00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:41.759
Nothing more?

46
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.239
Well, we're not robots,
if that's what you mean.

47
00:03:10.201 --> 00:03:11.440
Hey, Dad?

48
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.560
You're supposed
to be asleep.

49
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:21.880
Is it true
what the TV said?

50
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.800
That it's a war zone outside?

51
00:03:25.161 --> 00:03:27.039
Don't listen
to what the TV says.

52
00:03:27.121 --> 00:03:28.600
This is your home.
You hear me?

53
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.440
And you're safe here.

54
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:40.400
I'll buy that for a dollar.

55
00:03:41.881 --> 00:03:43.960
Get out! Get out!
Get out! Get out!

56
00:03:51.361 --> 00:03:53.120
This
neighborhood is the property

57
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:55.120
of Omni Consumer Products.

58
00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:58.200
All residents are requested
to vacate the area.

59
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.439
For God's sake, help us!

60
00:04:22.521 --> 00:04:24.239
That's what we're
here for, ma'am.

61
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:29.400
Just get on the bus.

62
00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:32.640
Where are they taking us, Dad?
What's happening?

63
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.439
Don't believe 'em!

64
00:04:36.681 --> 00:04:39.280
They'll throw us in the
streets to die like rats!

65
00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:41.400
Nazi sons of bitches!

66
00:04:47.041 --> 00:04:49.319
Shoot her if you have to,
but get her out of here.

67
00:04:49.401 --> 00:04:50.640
Yes, sir.

68
00:04:51.481 --> 00:04:53.360
Let's go.
Come on.

69
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.240
I think it's going rather
well, don't you, Seltz?

70
00:04:56.761 --> 00:04:57.800
Yes, sir.

71
00:04:58.481 --> 00:04:59.960
Come on!
I said, move!

72
00:05:01.081 --> 00:05:02.840
Manhandle an old lady,
would you?

73
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.119
Shut up!

74
00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:07.839
Move it!
Move it!

75
00:05:07.921 --> 00:05:08.880
Get up there!

76
00:05:08.961 --> 00:05:10.439
I said get up!

77
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.839
What are you doing down
there, you piece of slime?

78
00:05:16.121 --> 00:05:17.439
Didn't you hear me?

79
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:20.760
I said get up,
you drunken cow!

80
00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:26.680
Get back!
The crane's gonna blow!

81
00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.600
Come on!
Come on, move it!

82
00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:30.640
Move it!

83
00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:41.999
Listen to me, people!
These buses are going nowhere!

84
00:05:42.081 --> 00:05:44.360
Stay here!
Fight for your homes!

85
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.600
There is no silver lining,

86
00:05:46.681 --> 00:05:48.680
only corporate scumbags,

87
00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:50.920
who wanna line
their pockets!

88
00:05:51.001 --> 00:05:52.320
Stay here!

89
00:05:56.361 --> 00:05:57.400
Nikko!

90
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.320
Nikko! Nikko!

91
00:06:00.401 --> 00:06:01.560
Mom!

92
00:06:02.041 --> 00:06:04.199
Mom! Dad!

93
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:05.400
Nikko!

94
00:06:05.881 --> 00:06:07.720
No! Not my baby!

95
00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:09.720
Nikko! Nikko!

96
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.640
Mom!

97
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:14.920
Dad! Dad!

98
00:06:15.281 --> 00:06:17.320
Mom! Dad!

99
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.800
Mom!

100
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.640
Mom!

101
00:06:37.321 --> 00:06:38.359
Dad!

102
00:06:41.161 --> 00:06:42.240
Mom!

103
00:06:54.041 --> 00:06:56.360
You! Stay where you are!

104
00:07:03.961 --> 00:07:05.639
This
neighborhood is the property

105
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:07.679
of Omni Consumer Products.

106
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:10.039
All residents are requested...

107
00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:17.640
...here to assist you.

108
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.720
Repeat. The rehabilitation
officers are here to assist you.

109
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:25.080
Personal possessions
are limited to carry-on size.

110
00:07:25.321 --> 00:07:26.800
No furniture...

111
00:07:28.921 --> 00:07:31.159
Hush. It's okay.
It's okay.

112
00:07:32.281 --> 00:07:33.960
You're with us now.

113
00:07:34.281 --> 00:07:35.600
Is he gone?

114
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.760
Are we clear?

115
00:07:37.841 --> 00:07:39.000
Clear!

116
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.600
Okay, let's do it!

117
00:07:53.481 --> 00:07:55.800
Okay, Moreno,
cover your ears.

118
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.200
Rock 'n' roll.

119
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.040
All clear. Let's go.

120
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.560
Whoa! Jesus!

121
00:08:30.321 --> 00:08:31.320
Ed 209!

122
00:08:31.401 --> 00:08:33.200
He wasn't in the recon photo!

123
00:08:35.921 --> 00:08:37.119
Freeze!

124
00:08:37.201 --> 00:08:39.560
You are trespassing
on police property.

125
00:08:39.641 --> 00:08:40.959
Please surrender
your weapons.

126
00:08:41.041 --> 00:08:42.000
What the hell?

127
00:08:42.081 --> 00:08:43.240
What is she...
What is she crazy?

128
00:08:43.321 --> 00:08:45.000
You have 20 seconds
to comply.

129
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.520
Hey kid,
come back here!

130
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.200
You're gonna
get us all killed!

131
00:08:49.681 --> 00:08:51.799
What the hell
is she doing?

132
00:08:51.881 --> 00:08:55.880
You are in direct violation
of Penal Code 114, Section 3.

133
00:08:55.961 --> 00:08:58.440
I am authorized
to use physical force.

134
00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.640
You now have
10 seconds to comply.

135
00:09:03.201 --> 00:09:06.360
You won't believe this.
He'll be loyal as a puppy.

136
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.519
You have five seconds,

137
00:09:08.601 --> 00:09:09.879
four seconds,

138
00:09:09.961 --> 00:09:10.920
three seconds.

139
00:09:12.041 --> 00:09:13.879
You have one second
to comply.

140
00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.360
I am now authorized to...

141
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.680
Be loyal as a puppy.

142
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.400
Will it work?

143
00:09:32.281 --> 00:09:34.080
Stole it off
a dead cop.

144
00:09:41.201 --> 00:09:43.199
Holy shit!
That's the police armory!

145
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:46.160
Come on, come on.

146
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.040
They must have deleted
the access signature.

147
00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:49.080
Let's get out of here!

148
00:09:49.161 --> 00:09:51.080
No, they'll be
a few more minutes.

149
00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.320
All we gotta do is figure
out how to get that door open!

150
00:09:53.401 --> 00:09:54.760
Are you kiddin' me?

151
00:10:25.961 --> 00:10:26.959
Oh.

152
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.400
Oh.

153
00:10:33.601 --> 00:10:34.840
- Yeah!
- Wow!

154
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.439
One-stop shopping.

155
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.200
Let's go!
Gotta get out of here!

156
00:10:44.281 --> 00:10:45.560
All right,
all right, all right!

157
00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:51.040
What are you,
pickin' out drapes? Come on!

158
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.440
I'm comin'!

159
00:10:57.441 --> 00:10:58.639
Get that.

160
00:10:58.721 --> 00:10:59.720
Why?

161
00:10:59.801 --> 00:11:00.760
It looks expensive.

162
00:11:07.361 --> 00:11:09.520
Come on! Come on!
Let's go!

163
00:11:15.161 --> 00:11:16.599
Drop your weapons! Now!

164
00:11:16.681 --> 00:11:18.239
Do it! Drop 'em!

165
00:11:24.521 --> 00:11:27.920
Freeze. You are trespassing
on police property.

166
00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:30.520
Eat lead, suckers.

167
00:11:40.721 --> 00:11:42.840
Nikko, get in! Come on!

168
00:12:11.161 --> 00:12:13.560
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus

169
00:12:13.641 --> 00:12:15.640
Right down
Santa Claus lane

170
00:12:16.041 --> 00:12:18.440
Vixen and Blitzen
and all his reindeer

171
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.639
What can I do
for you, pal?

172
00:12:22.521 --> 00:12:24.359
Nobody move!

173
00:12:24.441 --> 00:12:26.920
Everything in the register! Now! Do it!

174
00:12:30.321 --> 00:12:32.760
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus

175
00:12:32.841 --> 00:12:35.080
Right down
Santa Claus lane

176
00:12:35.161 --> 00:12:37.440
What's it like being
a rocket scientist?

177
00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.040
All units,
we have a confirmed B and E

178
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.440
involving police property.
Please respond.

179
00:12:43.521 --> 00:12:45.240
Repeat. All units,
we have a confirmed...

180
00:12:45.321 --> 00:12:48.040
Hey, Donnelly,
it's your turn.

181
00:12:48.121 --> 00:12:50.159
No way, man. No.
We went last time.

182
00:12:50.241 --> 00:12:51.799
No, it's Lewis's turn.

183
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.000
Okay, okay, okay!
Lewis, you're up!

184
00:12:55.321 --> 00:12:57.920
Lewis, Lewis, Lewis.

185
00:12:58.001 --> 00:13:00.839
Lewis, Lewis, Lewis.

186
00:13:00.921 --> 00:13:04.080
Hey! Isn't anybody going
to arrest me, or what?

187
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.840
Hey, Lewis, where's your
friend Murphy, anyway?

188
00:13:06.921 --> 00:13:08.040
He's not real big
on donuts.

189
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.280
"He's not big on donuts."

190
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.280
I knew that.

191
00:13:10.361 --> 00:13:12.040
All units, repeat.

192
00:13:12.121 --> 00:13:14.800
That is a battered
yellow van, no plates.

193
00:13:14.881 --> 00:13:16.920
Sig tracking
shows southbound...

194
00:13:17.001 --> 00:13:18.799
Hey, that's
a battered, yellow van.

195
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:20.319
No shit, Sherlock.

196
00:13:31.041 --> 00:13:32.760
Hey, Moreno,
company's comin'!

197
00:13:36.601 --> 00:13:38.279
Hold on. Here we go!

198
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.920
Unit 477 in pursuit
eastbound Esposito.

199
00:13:57.001 --> 00:13:58.120
Watch it,
watch it, watch it.

200
00:13:58.201 --> 00:13:59.600
I'm watchin' it,
I'm watchin' it.

201
00:14:21.521 --> 00:14:22.839
Jeez, ahhh!

202
00:14:36.641 --> 00:14:38.520
Hey, Moreno,
they're still on our tail.

203
00:14:38.601 --> 00:14:39.999
Hey, don't sweat it.

204
00:14:40.361 --> 00:14:41.880
Here, watch this.

205
00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.479
Hold the champagne.

206
00:15:33.801 --> 00:15:35.240
You stopped in the middle
of the damned street.

207
00:15:35.321 --> 00:15:37.520
What the hell is going on? That
was my light! I had the light!

208
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.600
You idiot!

209
00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.639
Is everybody okay?

210
00:15:39.721 --> 00:15:41.800
Okay? What are you, a comedian?

211
00:15:41.881 --> 00:15:44.200
I traded in a brand-new SUX
for this Classic.

212
00:15:44.281 --> 00:15:47.039
Now, look at it. It's garbage.
It's going to the junkyard.

213
00:15:47.641 --> 00:15:48.760
What the hell is this,
fellas, huh?

214
00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:52.119
You give a broad a badge, and
she gets delusions of gander, huh?

215
00:15:52.641 --> 00:15:54.520
It's grandeur,
dumb shit.

216
00:15:58.641 --> 00:16:01.000
This new guy
is making me nervous.

217
00:16:02.041 --> 00:16:04.479
I don't think this is
exactly a guy, Moreno.

218
00:16:04.561 --> 00:16:06.080
You think it's him?

219
00:16:11.841 --> 00:16:13.360
Unit 477 to Dispatch.

220
00:16:13.441 --> 00:16:16.160
This is 477 to Dispatch.
Come in, Dispatch.

221
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.920
We could use some
backup out here.

222
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.120
Hello, Dispatch? Come
in. This is 477, Dispatch.

223
00:16:23.641 --> 00:16:24.759
Lewis.

224
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.639
Splatterpunks.

225
00:16:33.801 --> 00:16:35.080
Wait a second!
Wait a second!

226
00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:36.800
What do you need
the shotgun for?

227
00:16:37.201 --> 00:16:38.960
Ah, shit,
we're all going to die!

228
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.640
Sit tight, people.
Backup's coming.

229
00:16:40.721 --> 00:16:41.800
Sit tight?

230
00:16:41.881 --> 00:16:45.440
Hey, if it wasn't for you, I
wouldn't even be here, you dumb broad.

231
00:16:46.361 --> 00:16:48.400
I'll make you a deal,
tough guy.

232
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.600
You want to eat the tie,
keep it up.

233
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.720
Take it easy.
My brother's a cop.

234
00:17:33.921 --> 00:17:36.560
477 to Dispatch.
We have a Code 3.

235
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.600
We're low on ammo and need
immediate backup. Right now.

236
00:17:49.281 --> 00:17:50.520
Sergeant Reed,

237
00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.280
I've got Murphy's cruiser on the
grid, sir. He just turned around.

238
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:55.320
He what?

239
00:18:17.881 --> 00:18:19.800
Murphy, this is Reed!

240
00:18:19.881 --> 00:18:22.480
I have three other vehicles
en route to Lewis!

241
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.600
Murphy, continue pursuit!
That is a direct order!

242
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.120
Do I make myself clear?

243
00:18:28.561 --> 00:18:30.119
Murphy, are you listening?

244
00:19:36.321 --> 00:19:38.679
Police officer.
No loitering.

245
00:19:54.561 --> 00:19:56.000
You called for backup?

246
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.320
Thanks for dropping by,
Murphy.

247
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.320
Are they gone?

248
00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.200
I'm still scanning three.

249
00:20:16.441 --> 00:20:18.280
Make that two.

250
00:20:24.441 --> 00:20:26.760
Clock it, Jack!
Make us our own invention!

251
00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.839
Pop a tranq, hypo-head.
Splatterville is ours.

252
00:20:30.721 --> 00:20:32.760
Shoot him in the mouth,
splatter-brain!

253
00:20:32.841 --> 00:20:34.760
Cyborg eats
bullets, Jack!

254
00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.680
Not tonight, he don't.

255
00:21:25.761 --> 00:21:26.960
Shoot him in the mouth!
Do it! Do it!

256
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:27.999
Shut up! Shut up!

257
00:21:28.081 --> 00:21:29.560
Do it! Do it!

258
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.599
Shut up!

259
00:21:30.681 --> 00:21:32.519
Come on, shoot him
in the mouth!

260
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.559
- Do it!
- Shut up!

261
00:21:34.641 --> 00:21:35.760
- Shut up!
- Shoot him!

262
00:21:35.841 --> 00:21:37.640
Nice try, creeps.

263
00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.720
Give me it!

264
00:21:40.121 --> 00:21:41.960
You have the right
to remain silent.

265
00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.720
Down there.

266
00:21:58.401 --> 00:22:00.440
Jesus, Murphy,
are you okay?

267
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.880
I'm fine, Ann.
Thank you for asking.

268
00:22:05.881 --> 00:22:07.479
Come on,
come on, get on.

269
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.519
I want this
area cleaned up.

270
00:22:16.721 --> 00:22:18.400
Let's go. Let's go.

271
00:22:22.641 --> 00:22:25.120
Let's go!
Everything will be all right.

272
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.119
I have to ask you
to move with me.

273
00:22:28.401 --> 00:22:29.880
Come on!
Get your damn hands off...

274
00:22:35.001 --> 00:22:36.320
Stupid kid.

275
00:22:45.121 --> 00:22:46.999
Hey,
come here. Come on.

276
00:22:47.081 --> 00:22:48.759
Would you forget
the stupid kid already!

277
00:22:48.841 --> 00:22:50.240
Come on, in here.

278
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.560
Kanemitsu-san, please.

279
00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.840
Kanemitsu-san,

280
00:23:30.521 --> 00:23:33.879
I realize we've had certain
setbacks, but you've got my word.

281
00:23:33.961 --> 00:23:35.760
We've done everything
humanly possible

282
00:23:35.841 --> 00:23:37.719
to get Delta City
back on schedule.

283
00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:41.400
Kanemitsu-san,

284
00:23:41.481 --> 00:23:43.639
please, that's not necessary.

285
00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.320
Gentlemen.

286
00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:58.200
You are now looking
at a company in transition.

287
00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.520
Needless to say,

288
00:24:00.601 --> 00:24:05.279
this has resulted in the
implementation of certain, uh, well...

289
00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:08.439
Oh, let's call them cutbacks.

290
00:24:08.841 --> 00:24:12.240
Ah, but who can
put a price tag on a dream?

291
00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.239
Our esteemed former
chairman had a dream.

292
00:24:17.321 --> 00:24:19.200
He called it Delta City.

293
00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.640
Knock it off, Johnson.

294
00:24:24.801 --> 00:24:26.279
The great city
of Detroit

295
00:24:26.361 --> 00:24:28.879
represents an important
precedent, gentlemen.

296
00:24:29.601 --> 00:24:31.759
There's only
one small problem.

297
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.600
It's turning into
a war zone!

298
00:24:34.681 --> 00:24:36.839
Sir, it's just a small
resistance group.

299
00:24:36.921 --> 00:24:39.960
And there's no reason to believe
they pose a significant threat.

300
00:24:40.041 --> 00:24:41.639
Well, I'd consider

301
00:24:41.721 --> 00:24:44.200
a deficit of $350 million

302
00:24:44.281 --> 00:24:45.879
a significant threat,

303
00:24:45.961 --> 00:24:47.440
wouldn't you, Johnson?

304
00:24:49.081 --> 00:24:50.399
- Fleck!
- Sir.

305
00:24:51.041 --> 00:24:53.200
You're in charge
of Security Concepts.

306
00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.360
Where's that Robocop
we spent so much money on?

307
00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.639
The police had a little
problem with the unit, sir.

308
00:24:58.721 --> 00:25:00.200
I'm dealing with it
personally.

309
00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.680
You do that. You get
him to the Rehab team,

310
00:25:03.761 --> 00:25:07.600
and maybe we won't have to worry
about a small resistance group.

311
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.719
Get the hell out of here!
All of you!

312
00:25:10.801 --> 00:25:12.280
Oh, you take your time.

313
00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.600
And for God's sakes, Fleck,

314
00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.960
try to get the police
on our side.

315
00:25:22.401 --> 00:25:25.040
What if I don't want
a robot on my team?

316
00:25:26.681 --> 00:25:28.600
You've got four days,
McDaggett.

317
00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.160
If Cadillac Heights isn't cleared
for demolition by Friday midnight,

318
00:25:33.241 --> 00:25:35.080
our loans
will be called in.

319
00:25:35.161 --> 00:25:36.759
OCP will be ruined.

320
00:25:36.841 --> 00:25:38.600
We made a deal,
didn't we, chum?

321
00:25:40.121 --> 00:25:41.760
Oh, by the way,

322
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.560
if you're just now
figuring out

323
00:25:44.641 --> 00:25:47.440
the line between
big business and war

324
00:25:47.921 --> 00:25:49.399
is a little blurry,

325
00:25:50.241 --> 00:25:52.920
then you're further over the
hill than they say you are.

326
00:26:43.761 --> 00:26:45.000
This is entrapment.

327
00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.519
My client was visiting close
personal friends in that motel.

328
00:26:47.601 --> 00:26:50.720
Hey, buddy, your client's
close personal friends

329
00:26:50.801 --> 00:26:53.760
were a non-union video crew
and a German shepherd.

330
00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.160
That's prejudicial. Did the arresting
officer ask to see their union cards?

331
00:26:57.241 --> 00:26:58.200
Yeah, yeah!

332
00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.680
Cecil, come
get this crap.

333
00:27:00.761 --> 00:27:02.680
Will somebody please
answer the damn phone?

334
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.400
Metro West. No, ma'am,
we're not on strike.

335
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.879
You could've fooled me. I'll
deal with them looters myself,

336
00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:12.600
get me a baseball bat
with some nails in it.

337
00:27:21.441 --> 00:27:23.199
How're you feeling, Murphy?

338
00:27:24.401 --> 00:27:25.560
I've been better.

339
00:27:26.801 --> 00:27:28.200
Well, I'll be
honest with you,

340
00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.520
it looks like you just made
friends with a Mack truck.

341
00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.039
I don't have many

342
00:27:34.641 --> 00:27:35.600
friends.

343
00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.080
Captain gave me
the same speech.

344
00:27:37.161 --> 00:27:38.839
Yeah, well,
I heard it before.

345
00:27:38.921 --> 00:27:40.920
How many times does that make "before"?

346
00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.720
Dr. Lazarus?

347
00:27:49.161 --> 00:27:51.120
You want to tell me
what happened.

348
00:27:51.201 --> 00:27:53.840
Well, Atlanta beat
the Pistons last night.

349
00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.519
That's cute.
I meant with, uh, glory boy.

350
00:27:56.601 --> 00:27:57.800
Oh, him.

351
00:27:58.521 --> 00:28:01.400
He got shot to hell
and, uh, set on fire.

352
00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.880
You know what I'm talking about.
He disobeyed a direct order.

353
00:28:03.961 --> 00:28:05.200
I want to know why.

354
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.280
My real opinion?

355
00:28:06.361 --> 00:28:08.439
No, lie. Make up a story.

356
00:28:09.641 --> 00:28:11.160
Well, Mr. Fleck,

357
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.719
offhand, I'd say
the only reason

358
00:28:15.801 --> 00:28:17.359
he'd disobey an order

359
00:28:17.441 --> 00:28:19.559
is if he didn't
agree with it.

360
00:28:22.481 --> 00:28:23.760
Excuse me?

361
00:28:24.601 --> 00:28:26.240
Well, he made a decision.

362
00:28:26.721 --> 00:28:28.840
His friend was in trouble
and he made a judgment call.

363
00:28:28.921 --> 00:28:30.600
Cops do that, you know.
It's in the manual.

364
00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.640
Human cops do that. What do you mean,
his friend? This thing's a machine.

365
00:28:33.721 --> 00:28:36.600
Look, if OCP just wanted a
robot, why the hell did they

366
00:28:36.681 --> 00:28:37.960
put Murphy in there
in the first place?

367
00:28:38.041 --> 00:28:40.320
Murphy's dead, sweetheart.
That's on record.

368
00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.400
Mr. Fleck, this is Murphy.

369
00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.879
What's left of his face, portions
of the cerebrum, the cerebellum,

370
00:28:45.961 --> 00:28:48.200
it's human tissue
that's still alive.

371
00:28:48.281 --> 00:28:50.760
How can you interface human
components with a machine

372
00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:53.080
and then complain when the
human part makes a decision?

373
00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.400
Okay.

374
00:28:55.841 --> 00:28:57.760
So, not only

375
00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.840
did we get Murphy's
years of training

376
00:28:59.921 --> 00:29:03.080
and his law enforcement
skills, we also inherited his...

377
00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:07.320
His memories, his feelings,
his emotional baggage?

378
00:29:07.401 --> 00:29:09.759
Well, I'd call it
his humanity,

379
00:29:09.841 --> 00:29:12.280
but I don't think
you know that word.

380
00:29:13.561 --> 00:29:15.320
I see, well...

381
00:29:16.121 --> 00:29:19.320
Tell you what, Doctor, you talked me
into it. His emotions, get rid of 'em.

382
00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.120
Find out where they're
located and erase them.

383
00:29:22.201 --> 00:29:24.279
If that means wiping out
his memory, that's too bad.

384
00:29:25.641 --> 00:29:29.840
Um, we could cut out
the appropriate circuits

385
00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.280
by, uh, implanting
a micro neuro-barrier.

386
00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.759
Do it.

387
00:29:42.361 --> 00:29:44.879
'Cause I got news for you, babe, I
don't give a shit how smart you are.

388
00:29:44.961 --> 00:29:47.440
OCP owns the cops.
That means they own him.

389
00:29:47.521 --> 00:29:49.320
It means they own
your cute little ass.

390
00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:51.200
Nobody owns me.

391
00:29:52.081 --> 00:29:53.120
Fine.

392
00:29:53.681 --> 00:29:56.760
We want him
on the Rehab team.

393
00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.960
That means you
make him predictable,

394
00:29:59.041 --> 00:30:01.000
or you look for a new job, sweet cheeks.

395
00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.600
I think I'm in love.

396
00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.440
What's going through
your head, Murphy?

397
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.040
That's his family.

398
00:30:45.121 --> 00:30:47.920
Do you want me to install
that neuro-barrier, Doctor?

399
00:30:48.001 --> 00:30:49.560
No. I can do it.

400
00:30:56.761 --> 00:31:00.159
I think I'd like to be alone
with him, if it's all right?

401
00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.720
Alex, I thought
you'd never get home.

402
00:31:35.361 --> 00:31:39.119
Do not let the fact that these
people are homeless sway you.

403
00:31:40.921 --> 00:31:43.359
They are terrorists,
pure and simple.

404
00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.760
On the screens are
suspected rebel locations.

405
00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:51.560
If any of these locations
appear on your regular beat,

406
00:31:51.641 --> 00:31:52.799
check it out.

407
00:31:52.881 --> 00:31:55.559
Make sure you report
any unusual findings...

408
00:31:55.641 --> 00:31:56.919
Hey, Lewis.

409
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.960
Did you hear what
they did to Murphy?

410
00:32:02.041 --> 00:32:03.400
...and a brief description
of the suspicious...

411
00:32:44.281 --> 00:32:45.400
Murphy.

412
00:33:07.881 --> 00:33:10.000
Hey, Lewis,
you want your body armor?

413
00:33:10.081 --> 00:33:12.479
What? No.
I'm off duty.

414
00:33:15.561 --> 00:33:16.920
What's up, anyway?

415
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.800
Do you have family?

416
00:33:19.881 --> 00:33:21.440
Yeah. I have a brother
in Pittsburgh.

417
00:33:21.521 --> 00:33:23.720
The one who doesn't call.
You know that.

418
00:33:25.481 --> 00:33:27.159
Robo, are you okay?

419
00:33:27.641 --> 00:33:28.880
I'm fine.

420
00:33:30.561 --> 00:33:32.200
And call me Murphy.

421
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.400
Murphy?

422
00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:45.000
Step out of the building.

423
00:35:04.441 --> 00:35:06.280
Stay right there.

424
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.680
We're police officers.

425
00:35:08.761 --> 00:35:10.000
We don't want you.

426
00:35:10.081 --> 00:35:12.320
We have reason to believe there
are squatters in that structure.

427
00:35:12.401 --> 00:35:13.800
Now, step away
from the door.

428
00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:17.240
They're civilians inside.
They're just trying to stay warm.

429
00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.760
Those people belong in the
nearest rehabilitation center.

430
00:35:21.441 --> 00:35:23.999
Some of them are
armed terrorists.

431
00:35:24.081 --> 00:35:25.840
Now step away
from the door,

432
00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.679
or you'll be cited
for obstructing justice.

433
00:35:32.881 --> 00:35:35.200
Look, I'm not going to
ask politely next time.

434
00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.960
Now step away
from the door.

435
00:35:40.001 --> 00:35:41.999
This is your
final warning.

436
00:35:55.041 --> 00:35:56.880
You are making a mistake.

437
00:36:00.801 --> 00:36:02.920
Back off,
or there will be trouble.

438
00:36:03.001 --> 00:36:04.800
Now you're talking, Murphy.

439
00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.119
We're not budging.

440
00:36:06.201 --> 00:36:08.719
If you want to get in there, you
gonna have to shoot through us.

441
00:36:10.161 --> 00:36:12.439
I don't have a huge
problem with that.

442
00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.760
Cease fire!

443
00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.800
Robocop.

444
00:37:01.441 --> 00:37:03.319
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

445
00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.200
Come on! Come with us!

446
00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:12.759
Cover me.

447
00:37:31.521 --> 00:37:32.680
Let's go!
Let's go!

448
00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.520
Some tough cop I am,
huh, partner?

449
00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.040
Murphy.

450
00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.160
I'm scared.

451
00:38:02.361 --> 00:38:03.400
Don't be.

452
00:38:04.041 --> 00:38:05.719
It won't hurt long.

453
00:38:08.121 --> 00:38:09.640
Get them for me.

454
00:38:10.881 --> 00:38:12.120
Promise me.

455
00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:13.720
I promise.

456
00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.999
Murphy.

457
00:38:28.561 --> 00:38:29.960
Officer down.

458
00:38:39.641 --> 00:38:41.480
Just move it!
Come on!

459
00:38:41.561 --> 00:38:44.200
Come on, people,
we don't have much time.

460
00:38:44.281 --> 00:38:45.440
Nikko, let's go!

461
00:38:45.521 --> 00:38:47.480
Come on.
Come with us.

462
00:38:48.041 --> 00:38:51.000
What, is she crazy? He's
a cop! He's one of them.

463
00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.640
He's on our side now.

464
00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.759
She's right.
Oh, you saw what he did.

465
00:38:55.841 --> 00:38:58.040
What are you gonna let some
stupid kid make our decisions now?

466
00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.080
We're at war,
Coontz. We could use his help.

467
00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.280
Are you kiddin' me?

468
00:39:01.361 --> 00:39:03.599
Look at him!
He's totaled, man!

469
00:39:03.681 --> 00:39:06.280
People, come on! We don't
have time for this shit!

470
00:39:09.321 --> 00:39:10.360
He's right.

471
00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:12.960
We should go.

472
00:39:28.321 --> 00:39:30.000
Five meter spread!
Search the perimeter.

473
00:39:30.081 --> 00:39:32.239
Let's go!
Move it!

474
00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:33.879
Over there!

475
00:39:33.961 --> 00:39:34.920
Damn.

476
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.400
We're tracking him, sir.
He's moving.

477
00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.399
That's impossible.
The building's surrounded.

478
00:39:39.481 --> 00:39:40.759
He's gone underground.

479
00:39:41.681 --> 00:39:42.679
Find a manhole.

480
00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.960
We got a little held up.

481
00:40:18.521 --> 00:40:19.559
Rats?

482
00:40:22.681 --> 00:40:23.679
One or two.

483
00:40:29.401 --> 00:40:30.840
Go on through.

484
00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.880
Hey, are you okay?

485
00:40:45.241 --> 00:40:46.839
I'm fine.

486
00:40:48.601 --> 00:40:49.719
Hey!

487
00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.000
You guys!

488
00:40:56.641 --> 00:40:58.000
No, man!

489
00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.600
I told you it was
a mistake to bring him.

490
00:41:00.681 --> 00:41:02.199
Bet he weighs a ton.

491
00:41:03.001 --> 00:41:04.880
This is Rebel 2 to Base Op.

492
00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.599
- Come in, Base Op.
- Watch your step.

493
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:07.959
All right.

494
00:41:08.441 --> 00:41:09.400
We've got wounded over here.

495
00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.640
Clear the way, people,
come on. Get out of the way.

496
00:41:11.721 --> 00:41:13.199
Hold up your side.

497
00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:20.999
He don't look too good.

498
00:41:21.081 --> 00:41:24.839
Well, you wouldn't look so good either
if you took a grenade in your chest.

499
00:41:24.921 --> 00:41:26.160
Tracking.

500
00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.720
- Beacon.
- Tracking?

501
00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:30.640
Tracking beacon?

502
00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:32.239
What did I tell you? He's
gonna lead them right to us.

503
00:41:32.321 --> 00:41:33.960
Oh, shut up, Coontz.

504
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.160
Nikko, what's he
talking about?

505
00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:52.200
Did he booby trap
the 8th Street entrance?

506
00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.400
Maybe.

507
00:42:21.401 --> 00:42:23.440
Better get
mobilized, folks.

508
00:42:24.281 --> 00:42:26.920
They got a little too close
to home that time.

509
00:42:28.281 --> 00:42:29.999
It's not worth it, man.

510
00:42:30.081 --> 00:42:32.200
It is not worth this shit!

511
00:42:33.321 --> 00:42:36.360
You better take a real deep
breath right now, Coontz.

512
00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.680
Because if you don't
think it's worth it,

513
00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.679
then you're nothing
but excess baggage.

514
00:42:40.761 --> 00:42:42.039
Do you hear me?

515
00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:46.319
You get it together,
Coontz.

516
00:42:46.401 --> 00:42:50.159
Cadillac Heights may not
be much, but it's our homes.

517
00:42:50.241 --> 00:42:51.799
It's all we got.

518
00:42:52.561 --> 00:42:54.119
Now if you don't think
our homes is worth it,

519
00:42:54.201 --> 00:42:56.560
then you tell me
what the hell is?

520
00:43:03.521 --> 00:43:06.160
This is Bertha to Base Op.
We're comin' in.

521
00:43:06.241 --> 00:43:07.959
Set an extra place.

522
00:43:08.281 --> 00:43:10.360
We're bringing in a friend.

523
00:43:17.401 --> 00:43:19.359
Incoming caller.

524
00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:26.600
What do you want?

525
00:43:26.681 --> 00:43:28.520
Nice work, doll face.

526
00:43:28.601 --> 00:43:30.120
What're you talking about?

527
00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.800
You haven't heard?

528
00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:34.960
You might wanna
turn on Media Break.

529
00:43:36.001 --> 00:43:37.879
TV on. Channel 378.

530
00:43:38.361 --> 00:43:39.880
Witness
to the tragic shooting,

531
00:43:39.961 --> 00:43:42.280
was Rehab commander,
Paul McDaggett.

532
00:43:42.361 --> 00:43:44.840
Well, uh,
all I can say is,

533
00:43:44.921 --> 00:43:48.040
it's a terrible loss of a
fine fine public servant.

534
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.160
It's hard to believe she was
gunned down by her own partner.

535
00:43:53.721 --> 00:43:55.520
An OCP spokesperson has confirmed

536
00:43:55.601 --> 00:43:58.920
that Robocop has joined
the terrorist rebel forces.

537
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.080
He is heavily armed and should
be considered extremely dangerous.

538
00:44:03.161 --> 00:44:04.440
- On the...
- TV off.

539
00:44:04.521 --> 00:44:07.320
Congratulations,
sweet cheeks. Now listen up.

540
00:44:07.401 --> 00:44:10.480
I want your legendary ass
and your corporate ID card

541
00:44:10.561 --> 00:44:12.520
in my office
by 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.

542
00:44:12.601 --> 00:44:15.560
And maybe you won't be
brought up on charges.

543
00:44:15.641 --> 00:44:18.999
Meantime, you might want to
decide who's side you're on.

544
00:44:20.441 --> 00:44:21.560
Sleep tight.

545
00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:24.280
Call complete.

546
00:44:30.641 --> 00:44:31.600
He what?

547
00:44:31.681 --> 00:44:32.640
He opened fire
on the Rehabs.

548
00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:33.679
They're saying
he's gone underground.

549
00:44:33.761 --> 00:44:35.440
Oh, there goes
our P.R. budget.

550
00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:36.480
It's too big
to put a lid on.

551
00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.320
Company line
is he's gone renegade.

552
00:44:38.401 --> 00:44:39.360
How'd the CEO take it?

553
00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.640
How do you think
the CEO took it?

554
00:44:40.721 --> 00:44:41.759
Between me and you,
Johnson.

555
00:44:41.841 --> 00:44:43.959
I think the CEO
is starting to lose it.

556
00:44:44.041 --> 00:44:46.480
I mean, take a look
around, will you?

557
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.639
It's the fall of Rome
around here.

558
00:44:48.721 --> 00:44:50.959
It's Darwin time.
You know what I'm saying?

559
00:44:51.441 --> 00:44:53.559
Survival of the
least expendable.

560
00:44:53.641 --> 00:44:55.560
Remember
the Old Man, Jeff.

561
00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:56.920
Everyone's expendable.

562
00:44:59.241 --> 00:45:01.000
It can't be that bad.

563
00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.800
Honey, can you hear me?

564
00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:06.039
Are you there?

565
00:45:07.601 --> 00:45:11.200
Every corporation goes
through this sort of thing.

566
00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.000
Oh, my god.

567
00:45:17.081 --> 00:45:18.080
What happened?

568
00:45:30.841 --> 00:45:33.199
Oh, my god.
What happened?

569
00:45:35.161 --> 00:45:36.160
Hey, Wilson,
what's happening?

570
00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.999
Arnott just went
out the window.

571
00:45:38.081 --> 00:45:39.200
That's the fourth one
this month.

572
00:45:39.281 --> 00:45:40.599
Chicken shit!

573
00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.000
I'd eat a bullet myself.

574
00:45:43.681 --> 00:45:44.800
Less showy.

575
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.799
I'll tell you, Johnson,
the writing was on the wall

576
00:45:49.881 --> 00:45:51.159
the minute we hopped
in the sack with

577
00:45:51.241 --> 00:45:53.880
that piece of shit
Kanemitsu Corporation.

578
00:45:59.161 --> 00:46:01.160
As I was saying,
Otomo-san,

579
00:46:02.041 --> 00:46:05.039
we have a warrant out
for the arrest of Robocop.

580
00:46:05.521 --> 00:46:07.960
If we eliminate him,
then we'll find

581
00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:12.719
that the squatters are more,
well, let's say, easily persuaded.

582
00:46:25.121 --> 00:46:27.960
Fleck,
a word with you, son.

583
00:46:28.281 --> 00:46:30.040
I'm sorry
for the intrusion, sir.

584
00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:33.040
Is there anything
Security Concepts can do?

585
00:46:33.481 --> 00:46:36.719
Security Concepts
can kiss my freckled butt.

586
00:46:36.801 --> 00:46:37.960
You're fired.

587
00:46:38.841 --> 00:46:41.960
You heard me, Fleck! You're
fired! Get out of here.

588
00:46:50.801 --> 00:46:52.680
Three days till disaster.

589
00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.960
What the hell will I tell
my shareholders, Johnson?

590
00:46:56.641 --> 00:46:58.440
What about more Rehabs, sir?

591
00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:01.640
We could recruit them out of
the existing police department.

592
00:47:02.721 --> 00:47:04.760
It will be cheaper
than hiring mercenaries.

593
00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:08.440
And we could use the Metro West
facilities as a staging area.

594
00:47:09.721 --> 00:47:12.520
Give them a nominal raise
for an incentive.

595
00:47:12.601 --> 00:47:14.440
You're a good man, Johnson.

596
00:47:14.521 --> 00:47:17.240
I knew there was some reason
I made you a vice president.

597
00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.000
Thank you, sir.
I really...

598
00:48:01.081 --> 00:48:02.880
Yo, yo, heads up,
heads up.

599
00:48:04.921 --> 00:48:07.479
Come on, let's go.
We're gonna be late.

600
00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:59.039
Well? Can you fix him?

601
00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:03.640
This isn't a valve job
on a Chevy.

602
00:49:04.601 --> 00:49:07.400
I never worked on
a damn Robocop before.

603
00:49:07.481 --> 00:49:09.079
I can do the body work,
but...

604
00:49:09.161 --> 00:49:13.319
Look, all we gotta do is hold onto
the Heights for three more days.

605
00:49:14.121 --> 00:49:15.400
He can hold out
till then, can't he?

606
00:49:15.481 --> 00:49:17.680
Bertha, are you
listenin' to me?

607
00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:20.680
Huh? He is messed up.

608
00:49:20.761 --> 00:49:22.000
We don't have
the equipment.

609
00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:23.640
Well, who the hell does?

610
00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:26.600
Lazarus.

611
00:49:30.521 --> 00:49:33.160
Find Doctor

612
00:49:35.081 --> 00:49:36.200
Lazarus.

613
00:50:06.201 --> 00:50:07.280
Hey!

614
00:50:08.801 --> 00:50:10.120
Who are you?

615
00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:12.600
I'm friends with Robocop.

616
00:50:14.121 --> 00:50:18.039
Oh. Well, he's not here. I'm sorry.

617
00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:20.480
You don't believe me.

618
00:50:26.641 --> 00:50:28.960
To tell you the truth, I don't
know what to believe anymore.

619
00:50:29.401 --> 00:50:31.359
He... He had
a message for you.

620
00:50:32.481 --> 00:50:34.919
He said to thank you

621
00:50:35.001 --> 00:50:36.920
for not taking
his memories away.

622
00:50:57.081 --> 00:50:59.280
Well, well, well.

623
00:51:00.601 --> 00:51:02.520
Afraid you're
a little late, pal.

624
00:51:04.761 --> 00:51:07.279
You must be one
of Kanemitsu's boys.

625
00:51:08.321 --> 00:51:09.560
I'm impressed.

626
00:51:10.361 --> 00:51:11.799
Trouble is...

627
00:51:15.041 --> 00:51:16.400
Your boss.

628
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:19.919
He kind of owns OCP.

629
00:51:20.001 --> 00:51:23.039
And OCP is kind of on our
shit list with a bullet.

630
00:52:00.281 --> 00:52:02.080
Uh.

631
00:52:02.521 --> 00:52:05.279
So you wanna know
where the rebels are?

632
00:52:06.321 --> 00:52:09.360
You can tell your bosses
to kiss my ass.

633
00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:49.719
A vehicle is approaching.

634
00:53:43.801 --> 00:53:45.080
How're you doing, Murphy?

635
00:53:45.921 --> 00:53:47.120
I've been better.

636
00:53:47.681 --> 00:53:48.839
Give me a status scan.

637
00:53:49.081 --> 00:53:50.400
Organics intact.

638
00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:53.800
System's efficiency, 23%.

639
00:53:56.041 --> 00:53:58.120
It looks like a direct hit to the heart.

640
00:53:58.201 --> 00:54:00.639
I may have to recalibrate
the pneumatic systems as well.

641
00:54:00.721 --> 00:54:01.879
Is he gonna die?

642
00:54:04.441 --> 00:54:05.800
Not if I can help it.

643
00:54:07.121 --> 00:54:09.200
Let's get everything
hooked up to the generator.

644
00:54:10.001 --> 00:54:11.160
We've got work to do.

645
00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:13.480
Now, listen.

646
00:54:13.561 --> 00:54:16.200
I'm gonna unplug you
for a little while, cowboy.

647
00:54:17.561 --> 00:54:19.839
Don't worry. Everything's
going to be okay.

648
00:54:25.961 --> 00:54:27.320
Here you go.

649
00:54:28.641 --> 00:54:30.200
I got that heart you wanted.

650
00:54:31.001 --> 00:54:32.680
I said a Nissan.
That's a Kanemitsu.

651
00:54:32.761 --> 00:54:33.720
Oh, Jesus!

652
00:54:33.801 --> 00:54:35.199
Jeez! Hey, Zack, we
need that sealant pack.

653
00:54:35.281 --> 00:54:36.320
Zack!

654
00:54:36.801 --> 00:54:38.520
Marie! Marie, look!

655
00:54:38.961 --> 00:54:40.200
Oh, shit.

656
00:54:42.521 --> 00:54:44.680
Hey, bring that
chest plate over here.

657
00:54:45.561 --> 00:54:46.480
Time for the
chest plate.

658
00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:48.720
Huh? Hey!

659
00:54:48.801 --> 00:54:50.520
You wait, man.

660
00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.240
You are gonna be
so cherry.

661
00:54:54.161 --> 00:54:56.000
Hey, Moreno, watch out
for the, uh...

662
00:54:56.081 --> 00:54:58.239
What the hell
are you doing, man?

663
00:54:58.321 --> 00:55:00.279
Well, I didn't know
that thing was there.

664
00:55:00.361 --> 00:55:01.640
What are you trying to do?
It's behind the...

665
00:55:01.721 --> 00:55:02.680
Don't yell at me.

666
00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:03.719
Well, don't do it.

667
00:55:19.961 --> 00:55:21.160
Murphy.

668
00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:22.600
It's you.

669
00:55:29.121 --> 00:55:31.159
Alex, I thought
you'd never get home.

670
00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:00.600
Welcome home, Murphy.

671
00:56:27.681 --> 00:56:29.000
I couldn't sleep.

672
00:56:29.081 --> 00:56:30.200
How are you feeling?

673
00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:32.840
My efficiency rate is 93%.

674
00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:37.160
Anything above 90
is considered normal.

675
00:56:37.721 --> 00:56:40.520
Um, I heard Marie
call you Murphy.

676
00:56:41.841 --> 00:56:43.240
Is that your real name?

677
00:56:44.281 --> 00:56:45.240
It was.

678
00:56:46.401 --> 00:56:47.360
Before...

679
00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:50.040
Before what?

680
00:57:02.681 --> 00:57:03.920
So, um...

681
00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:10.159
Now that you're better,
will you stay?

682
00:57:10.761 --> 00:57:11.920
Will you help us?

683
00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:14.240
You know what Bertha says?

684
00:57:14.321 --> 00:57:17.279
She says if we hold back the
Rehabs for just two more days,

685
00:57:17.361 --> 00:57:19.280
they won't be able
to make us move.

686
00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.999
And they'll have to
let my parents go.

687
00:57:21.081 --> 00:57:23.840
And we'll all be together
like family again.

688
00:57:26.041 --> 00:57:27.480
Your parents?

689
00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:51.319
Murphy, you okay?

690
00:57:52.601 --> 00:57:54.120
Your parents,

691
00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.640
you miss them?

692
00:57:58.641 --> 00:57:59.640
Yeah.

693
00:58:02.521 --> 00:58:05.279
But you remember them.

694
00:58:07.321 --> 00:58:10.760
Because if you remember them,

695
00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:13.840
they're never really gone.

696
00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:36.120
Hey, Murphy,

697
00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:39.640
I'm glad your
new heart works.

698
00:58:46.361 --> 00:58:47.480
I heard voices.

699
00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:54.560
She should be in bed.

700
00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:03.039
Could you leave her
just a moment?

701
00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:08.880
Of course.

702
00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:27.999
Won't be the same, dear

703
00:59:28.081 --> 00:59:31.240
If you're not here with me

704
00:59:32.601 --> 00:59:35.440
Hey, you gotta pay for that.

705
00:59:38.521 --> 00:59:39.560
Hey!

706
00:59:43.001 --> 00:59:44.999
What are you, deaf?
Son of a...

707
01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.040
That's not what we said
we were going to do.

708
01:00:07.121 --> 01:00:08.080
That is, too, what we were gonna do.

709
01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.160
That's not what we said
we were going to do.

710
01:00:09.241 --> 01:00:10.440
That's where
the Heights is.

711
01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:11.560
Right there.
Right there.

712
01:00:11.641 --> 01:00:12.839
Hey, Bertha, you told us
to relocate the weapons,

713
01:00:12.921 --> 01:00:14.840
but where do you
want this thing?

714
01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.520
Oh, my God.

715
01:00:20.321 --> 01:00:22.039
How did you get this?

716
01:00:22.521 --> 01:00:24.680
We stole it from
the police depot. Why?

717
01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:28.040
You know this looks like the
exhaust system from an F-27.

718
01:00:28.121 --> 01:00:30.679
No. It's the prototype
for Robo's flight pack.

719
01:00:30.761 --> 01:00:32.920
The funding ran out before
we got a chance to test it.

720
01:00:34.161 --> 01:00:35.759
How do you know
so much about it?

721
01:00:35.841 --> 01:00:37.440
Oh, I designed it.

722
01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:43.480
Well, it looks like the odds
on the home team just went up.

723
01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:03.080
Okay, now what I've done is
programmed the command system

724
01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.519
to take its cues
from your hard drive.

725
01:01:06.241 --> 01:01:09.160
I've also rigged it to work
as an auxiliary power unit.

726
01:01:09.241 --> 01:01:12.280
So, if you ever have a power
drain like you did yesterday,

727
01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.080
just interface
with the flight pack

728
01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.960
and recharge
whether you fly or not.

729
01:01:17.081 --> 01:01:19.320
And, Nikko, you see those
resistors over there by the ratchet?

730
01:01:19.401 --> 01:01:20.999
Get them for me,
will you?

731
01:01:21.081 --> 01:01:22.799
Get them for me, will you?

732
01:01:22.881 --> 01:01:24.439
Get them for me.

733
01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.959
Get them for me.

734
01:01:30.121 --> 01:01:31.439
Promise me.

735
01:01:34.081 --> 01:01:35.320
Get them for me.

736
01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.080
Promise me.

737
01:01:49.721 --> 01:01:51.280
What's goin' on?

738
01:01:51.521 --> 01:01:52.600
Excuse me.

739
01:01:55.601 --> 01:01:57.199
Hey, man,
where you goin'?

740
01:01:58.361 --> 01:01:59.880
Unfinished business.

741
01:02:06.201 --> 01:02:08.000
It's okay.
He'll be back.

742
01:02:08.081 --> 01:02:09.559
He needs us, too.

743
01:02:10.961 --> 01:02:12.120
Where's he going?

744
01:02:13.881 --> 01:02:15.159
To keep a promise.

745
01:02:16.361 --> 01:02:19.279
Sarge, you got a
Robocop. You got an alien cop?

746
01:02:19.361 --> 01:02:21.000
Huh? You got
ghost cop?

747
01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.559
Leon, I told you,
I don't have time for this.

748
01:02:22.641 --> 01:02:23.600
You got a vampire cop?

749
01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.440
Murphy.

750
01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.159
Good evening,
Sergeant Reed.

751
01:02:32.241 --> 01:02:34.480
Do you know there's a
warrant out for your arrest?

752
01:02:35.441 --> 01:02:36.520
Yes.

753
01:02:36.601 --> 01:02:39.039
I was just checkin'.
What can I do for you?

754
01:02:39.481 --> 01:02:42.039
Please direct me
to the Rehab staging area.

755
01:02:42.121 --> 01:02:45.240
Oh, well, it's just down
the hall. You can't miss it.

756
01:02:46.241 --> 01:02:47.519
Thank you.

757
01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:54.280
You may want to call
the fire department.

758
01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.080
Quadrants
fourth grade are clear.

759
01:02:59.161 --> 01:03:01.960
All central units are to
remain on Class-4 alert

760
01:03:02.041 --> 01:03:03.640
until 2200 hours.

761
01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.440
- Hey, you got a light?
- Sure, man.

762
01:03:06.521 --> 01:03:08.160
Allow me, scum.

763
01:03:13.521 --> 01:03:14.959
Look out!

764
01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:35.320
Ahhh!

765
01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:39.720
Oh, shit.

766
01:03:55.481 --> 01:03:56.840
Where's McDaggett?

767
01:04:09.321 --> 01:04:12.240
He's coming out tonight

768
01:04:12.321 --> 01:04:14.920
That does
not look like a police station.

769
01:04:15.001 --> 01:04:17.239
You're damn right,
I'm not at the police station.

770
01:04:17.321 --> 01:04:20.080
If my spy hadn't warned
me, I'd be dead now.

771
01:04:21.241 --> 01:04:24.680
I thought your damn ninja was supposed
to take care of Robocop for me.

772
01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.959
That's the deal.
I clear the area,

773
01:04:27.041 --> 01:04:28.920
he keeps the robot
off my back.

774
01:04:29.641 --> 01:04:32.319
You have the device
I had sent you?

775
01:04:36.761 --> 01:04:39.880
It hasn't come to that yet,
and it won't. Relax.

776
01:04:39.961 --> 01:04:44.280
It is difficult for me to
continue our business relationship

777
01:04:44.361 --> 01:04:46.559
when I do not know
your methods.

778
01:04:46.641 --> 01:04:49.000
You don't need
to know my methods.

779
01:04:49.081 --> 01:04:52.040
I said I'll clear the area,
and I'll clear it.

780
01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:56.599
Just get the robot cop
off my back.

781
01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:10.760
I understand you're
willing to pay good money

782
01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:13.240
to know where
the rebel Base Op is.

783
01:05:13.401 --> 01:05:15.119
Yes, well, um...

784
01:05:16.441 --> 01:05:17.600
The money's good,

785
01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:20.719
if the tip's good.

786
01:05:21.081 --> 01:05:22.040
Yeah.

787
01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.680
Well, uh...

788
01:05:26.121 --> 01:05:29.000
The last tip saved
your ass, didn't it?

789
01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:45.800
Hey, hey,
hey, hey!

790
01:05:45.881 --> 01:05:47.800
What do we have
here, huh?

791
01:05:48.361 --> 01:05:50.359
What's the matter? You don't
like a man in uniform, huh?

792
01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.840
Look, my dad lost his job. I
just need some money. That's all.

793
01:05:52.921 --> 01:05:54.719
Oh, we got lots
of money, honey.

794
01:05:55.041 --> 01:05:57.320
Don't! No!

795
01:05:57.401 --> 01:05:58.960
She said, "no"!

796
01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:00.280
Huh?

797
01:06:01.681 --> 01:06:03.440
Maybe you have
a hearing problem.

798
01:06:08.641 --> 01:06:10.480
Go home, young lady.

799
01:06:11.161 --> 01:06:13.320
You are in violation
of curfew.

800
01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:25.560
Where's McDaggett?

801
01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.119
Room 212.

802
01:06:30.201 --> 01:06:31.520
Thank you.

803
01:06:32.241 --> 01:06:34.079
I hope you are insured.

804
01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.160
Elevator door sticks.

805
01:06:56.921 --> 01:06:57.959
Don't.

806
01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.440
I have a message
from Officer Lewis.

807
01:07:27.761 --> 01:07:28.760
Stop!

808
01:07:31.521 --> 01:07:32.480
Drive!

809
01:07:33.041 --> 01:07:35.440
I said drive.
Goddammit, drive!

810
01:07:43.801 --> 01:07:45.320
...I want my time, my money.

811
01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:46.840
I told you once. And I'm
not going to tell you again.

812
01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:47.879
You understand?

813
01:07:47.961 --> 01:07:50.199
I must commandeer your
vehicle for police use.

814
01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:53.400
What is your
problem, sucker?

815
01:07:56.001 --> 01:07:57.560
I mean, Officer.

816
01:09:05.721 --> 01:09:06.920
Cover me!

817
01:09:57.001 --> 01:09:58.319
Commander!

818
01:10:20.041 --> 01:10:22.680
Hey, what's the
deal, Robo was shot?

819
01:10:33.521 --> 01:10:35.840
Where the hell
is Robocop?

820
01:10:37.361 --> 01:10:39.800
We could drive around
and listen for explosions.

821
01:10:47.601 --> 01:10:48.919
Hey, are you
doing that?

822
01:10:49.001 --> 01:10:50.440
I got tired
of splicing wires,

823
01:10:50.521 --> 01:10:52.199
so I put in a pulse tach decoder.

824
01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:53.240
A telemetric?

825
01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.000
- No.
- Smart ass.

826
01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.879
I know you are,
but what am I?

827
01:10:57.881 --> 01:10:59.599
Here, let me try it.

828
01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:12.239
Thanks for the
heart attack, Coontz.

829
01:11:12.321 --> 01:11:15.040
Maybe I will go
and send out a recon team.

830
01:11:15.681 --> 01:11:17.400
I got a better idea.

831
01:11:18.201 --> 01:11:20.760
Why don't we just
all have a seat

832
01:11:21.481 --> 01:11:22.799
and relax?

833
01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:25.399
It'll all be over
in a few minutes.

834
01:11:25.761 --> 01:11:27.439
You son of a bitch.

835
01:11:27.521 --> 01:11:28.799
Hey, watch the language.

836
01:11:28.881 --> 01:11:30.800
There's children
present, remember?

837
01:11:34.121 --> 01:11:35.640
Drop it, Coontz.

838
01:11:37.961 --> 01:11:40.520
I'm not gonna ask twice.

839
01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.680
What did you mean about it all
being over in a few minutes?

840
01:11:51.961 --> 01:11:54.080
Get the kids
out of here! Now!

841
01:11:56.081 --> 01:11:57.640
- Where are we going?
- Just follow me.

842
01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:09.080
Bertha!

843
01:12:10.001 --> 01:12:11.120
Oh! No.

844
01:12:14.041 --> 01:12:15.039
Go.

845
01:12:18.281 --> 01:12:19.320
Got to get her.

846
01:12:19.401 --> 01:12:20.360
Go.

847
01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:23.640
Come on, let's go.
Come on!

848
01:12:31.001 --> 01:12:32.360
Now!

849
01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:43.959
Okay, come on.

850
01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:50.440
Come on! Get in!
Come on!

851
01:12:53.401 --> 01:12:54.360
Come on.

852
01:12:54.441 --> 01:12:56.280
Keep going.

853
01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:58.919
Okay. Now go!

854
01:12:59.001 --> 01:12:59.999
Go on!

855
01:13:00.081 --> 01:13:02.120
No! It's happening again.

856
01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:04.040
Don't let them
take you away.

857
01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:12.120
I said go!
Get out of here!

858
01:13:27.201 --> 01:13:28.600
Where is he?

859
01:13:30.801 --> 01:13:32.160
Go to hell.

860
01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:34.000
Take her to headquarters.

861
01:13:34.081 --> 01:13:36.160
I promise my men
won't leave a mark on you.

862
01:13:37.401 --> 01:13:39.840
Let's go.
We got 'em all.

863
01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:44.920
Sir, what about
our friend Coontz?

864
01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:49.399
Well, if we'd let him live,
we'd have to have paid him.

865
01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:53.680
This building
is now under OCP jurisdiction.

866
01:13:58.761 --> 01:14:01.560
We are talking about hundreds of
thousands of dollars in damage.

867
01:14:01.641 --> 01:14:03.440
So Murphy can be
rough on properties.

868
01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:04.879
Good, well,

869
01:14:04.961 --> 01:14:08.400
every cent of it will be
coming out of your salaries.

870
01:14:08.481 --> 01:14:10.519
Hey, you built him.

871
01:14:18.241 --> 01:14:20.320
Sergeant, we're taking
Cadillac Heights.

872
01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:23.679
I'll need 50 of your men armed
and in full-body armor in one hour.

873
01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:26.559
Mr. Johnson, you can tell
the CEO the demolition crews

874
01:14:26.641 --> 01:14:29.320
will have total access at
0600 hours tomorrow morning.

875
01:14:29.401 --> 01:14:32.879
Hey, we don't do
that kind of work.

876
01:14:32.961 --> 01:14:35.199
That was a direct order,
Sergeant.

877
01:14:35.281 --> 01:14:38.560
Driving people out of their
homes is no work for a cop!

878
01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:41.000
Now, Sergeant,

879
01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:43.959
15 years on the force
is quite an investment.

880
01:14:44.841 --> 01:14:46.280
Your job, your pension.

881
01:14:46.801 --> 01:14:49.199
Maybe instead of worrying
about these squatter people,

882
01:14:49.281 --> 01:14:51.320
you might think
about your own family.

883
01:14:52.281 --> 01:14:53.320
I am.

884
01:15:02.121 --> 01:15:05.000
I'm thinking I have
to go home and face them.

885
01:15:20.561 --> 01:15:22.200
You can't do this!

886
01:15:24.601 --> 01:15:28.600
Look, you are employees
of OCP. Now remember that!

887
01:15:30.841 --> 01:15:33.759
You're jeopardizing
your retirement benefits.

888
01:15:46.161 --> 01:15:47.479
Stop that man.

889
01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:55.480
How would you and your friends
like to make some money, chum?

890
01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:08.560
- It's...
- Johnny...

891
01:16:08.641 --> 01:16:10.040
- Rehab!
- Hooray.

892
01:16:24.161 --> 01:16:25.240
Johnny Rehab.

893
01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:28.079
Action figures, parts and
accessories all sold separately.

894
01:16:29.081 --> 01:16:31.440
Three nuns and five
clergy are dead today

895
01:16:31.521 --> 01:16:35.680
in what is believed to be the latest
atrocity by the killer cyborg, Robocop.

896
01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:37.960
OCP officials claim
the former police unit

897
01:16:38.041 --> 01:16:40.880
is responsible
for a spree of terrorism

898
01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:43.920
in the Cadillac Heights
section of old Detroit.

899
01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.480
I'm sorry.
I can't even read this.

900
01:16:48.441 --> 01:16:51.119
Come on, this is bullshit.
Are you buying this?

901
01:16:51.201 --> 01:16:54.640
I mean, are you
kidding me, Robocop?

902
01:17:54.441 --> 01:17:55.600
Marie.

903
01:18:08.401 --> 01:18:09.880
You lousy sons of bitches!

904
01:18:11.001 --> 01:18:12.120
OCP bastards!

905
01:18:12.201 --> 01:18:14.120
Nobody is listening
to you, sweetheart.

906
01:18:18.561 --> 01:18:20.680
This is Big Stick to all
teams. You have a green.

907
01:18:20.761 --> 01:18:22.400
Arm up and proceed
to strike zone.

908
01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.160
All teams, we have a green.

909
01:18:25.241 --> 01:18:27.160
All teams, we have a green.

910
01:18:28.961 --> 01:18:30.600
Hey, take it easy.

911
01:18:42.961 --> 01:18:44.399
Jimmy!

912
01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:47.480
Hey, wait up!

913
01:18:49.241 --> 01:18:51.119
Come on!
Come on!

914
01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.160
So, what now?

915
01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:56.680
What now?

916
01:18:56.761 --> 01:18:58.960
Game's over, Moreno.
Just shut up.

917
01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.719
What about
Bertha's plan?

918
01:19:00.801 --> 01:19:02.639
Dammit, Bertha's dead!

919
01:19:05.841 --> 01:19:07.439
I'm sorry. I'm...

920
01:19:09.721 --> 01:19:10.839
There.

921
01:19:30.401 --> 01:19:33.040
Folks, in about 45 minutes,

922
01:19:33.121 --> 01:19:36.000
the Rehabs are coming to blow
you out of your neighborhood.

923
01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:37.680
I want you
to take your kids

924
01:19:37.761 --> 01:19:40.640
and anybody who shouldn't
be fighting to the basement.

925
01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.639
The rest of you
are hereby deputized

926
01:19:43.721 --> 01:19:45.959
by the Detroit
Police Department.

927
01:19:47.561 --> 01:19:50.320
It's time to show
how real cops kick ass.

928
01:21:03.681 --> 01:21:04.799
Detroit Police.

929
01:21:04.881 --> 01:21:06.479
Identify yourself.

930
01:21:11.841 --> 01:21:15.280
You are under arrest
for assaulting an officer.

931
01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:27.640
And destruction
of police property.

932
01:22:06.881 --> 01:22:08.840
Quiet! Quiet!

933
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.600
Hold your fire until
absolutely necessary!

934
01:23:40.921 --> 01:23:41.960
Commander,

935
01:23:42.041 --> 01:23:44.039
Detroit Police
are out there, sir.

936
01:23:44.121 --> 01:23:45.279
They're fighting
against us.

937
01:23:45.361 --> 01:23:48.040
So? We have
a schedule to keep.

938
01:23:48.121 --> 01:23:50.040
We don't fire
on police officers!

939
01:23:50.121 --> 01:23:51.839
You're out of line,
McDaggett.

940
01:23:51.921 --> 01:23:54.240
I'm still in charge here.
I'm pulling the plug!

941
01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:55.880
Sit down.

942
01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:57.640
What, you've gone
war wacky?

943
01:24:00.801 --> 01:24:03.359
I said, sit down.

944
01:24:06.361 --> 01:24:07.560
Good idea.

945
01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:15.960
How are we getting
out of here anyway?

946
01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.240
Nikko!

947
01:24:19.921 --> 01:24:21.320
How did you get...

948
01:24:21.401 --> 01:24:23.840
No, never mind. Did you see
a transmission dish outside?

949
01:24:23.921 --> 01:24:27.239
Yeah, and I was just watching
the Media Break guy pick his nose.

950
01:24:27.321 --> 01:24:29.439
Okay, do you have your
computer with you?

951
01:24:33.721 --> 01:24:35.280
People of Detroit,

952
01:24:35.361 --> 01:24:36.680
this is an illegal
broadcast.

953
01:24:36.761 --> 01:24:40.080
It may be cut off at any
time, so listen to me.

954
01:24:40.761 --> 01:24:42.599
OCP is lying to you.

955
01:24:42.681 --> 01:24:45.040
They're destroying people's
lives for big business.

956
01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.000
Those Rehabs
you see on TV,

957
01:24:51.081 --> 01:24:53.159
they're mercenaries
hired by OCP

958
01:24:53.241 --> 01:24:55.440
to throw people out of their
homes and into the streets!

959
01:25:04.041 --> 01:25:06.280
You've got to believe me.

960
01:25:06.361 --> 01:25:07.679
I'm speaking
for all the homeless

961
01:25:07.761 --> 01:25:09.160
and jobless citizens
of this city

962
01:25:09.241 --> 01:25:12.280
and every city like it run by
the heartless, capitalist scumbags

963
01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:15.880
who want you to think their way and
do whatever will make them more money.

964
01:25:15.961 --> 01:25:19.199
See those commercials for Delta City
where the future has a silver lining?

965
01:25:19.281 --> 01:25:21.440
Well, only silver
is lining their pockets.

966
01:25:21.521 --> 01:25:23.560
OCP doesn't care
about the people.

967
01:25:23.641 --> 01:25:26.120
OCP cares about
rich people.

968
01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:28.240
Right now, as I speak, the
people of Cadillac Heights

969
01:25:28.321 --> 01:25:30.680
are being forced out of
their very own neighborhood.

970
01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:33.800
Your neighborhood's next
unless you fight back now!

971
01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.800
Time is running out.
OCP is the enemy...

972
01:25:38.921 --> 01:25:41.080
I repeat,
time is running out.

973
01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:42.920
OCP is the enemy.

974
01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:46.000
Help us.
Innocent people are dying.

975
01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:15.719
Need more ammo.

976
01:26:15.801 --> 01:26:17.400
Ammo! Ammo!

977
01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:39.560
Zack's hit!

978
01:26:44.601 --> 01:26:47.160
They're winning,
aren't they, Sergeant?

979
01:26:58.080 --> 01:26:59.879
What in the name of...

980
01:27:23.441 --> 01:27:24.400
Yes!

981
01:27:27.921 --> 01:27:29.079
Sir?

982
01:27:42.761 --> 01:27:44.760
Splatter that,
you sons of bitches.

983
01:28:08.641 --> 01:28:10.519
All right, Mr. Robocop,

984
01:28:11.281 --> 01:28:12.600
come and get me.

985
01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:18.280
Get away
from the door!

986
01:28:31.881 --> 01:28:33.080
Think it over!

987
01:28:35.241 --> 01:28:38.400
Oh, my God, Johnson. Our
stock has dropped to nothing.

988
01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:39.480
We're ruined.

989
01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.920
How may I help you,
Officer?

990
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.880
By resisting arrest.

991
01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:03.800
Don't count on it, chum.

992
01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:06.160
Anyway,
what's the charge?

993
01:29:06.241 --> 01:29:08.200
The murder of Ann Lewis.

994
01:29:10.281 --> 01:29:12.720
Dead or alive,
you're coming with me.

995
01:29:39.321 --> 01:29:43.160
McDaggett, you can have
OCP. It's all yours.

996
01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:44.200
Sayonara.

997
01:29:44.281 --> 01:29:47.440
Where are you going?
You're gonna miss all the fun!

998
01:30:33.641 --> 01:30:36.480
No flashy bravery,
tin man,

999
01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:39.000
or the two cuties
say "bye-bye".

1000
01:30:39.081 --> 01:30:40.679
What are you doing?

1001
01:30:40.761 --> 01:30:42.360
What are you doing?

1002
01:30:50.081 --> 01:30:51.840
Stop them! Stop them!

1003
01:31:01.601 --> 01:31:03.480
Stupid fools!

1004
01:31:03.801 --> 01:31:06.160
Don't you know
what you've done to us?

1005
01:31:07.521 --> 01:31:11.200
Those androids are programmed
with a thermal fail-safe device.

1006
01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:13.800
They're made
to self-destruct.

1007
01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:16.400
In 15 seconds,
everything within 20 yards

1008
01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:19.000
of where we're standing
will be atomized.

1009
01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:21.559
We're dead,
you stupid slag!

1010
01:31:21.641 --> 01:31:23.479
Don't count on it, chum.

1011
01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:34.159
Hang on.

1012
01:31:57.241 --> 01:31:59.679
Come on.
Let me give you a hand.

1013
01:32:26.721 --> 01:32:28.000
Kanemitsu-san,

1014
01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:31.359
I... I realize
that it looks bad,

1015
01:32:31.441 --> 01:32:34.160
but maybe our plans
were over ambitious.

1016
01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:36.839
Let's start
a sukoshi bit smaller.

1017
01:32:36.921 --> 01:32:38.879
Let's gentrify
this neighborhood,

1018
01:32:38.961 --> 01:32:41.759
build strip malls,
fast food chains,

1019
01:32:41.841 --> 01:32:44.840
lots of popular entertainment.
What do you think?

1020
01:32:50.041 --> 01:32:51.000
What did he say?

1021
01:32:51.081 --> 01:32:52.280
He said you're fired.

1022
01:33:20.121 --> 01:33:22.239
Well, I got to
hand it to you.

1023
01:33:23.361 --> 01:33:25.200
What do they call you?

1024
01:33:25.281 --> 01:33:26.720
Murphy, is it?

1025
01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:29.359
My friends
call me Murphy.

1026
01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:34.159
You call me

1027
01:33:34.241 --> 01:33:35.320
Robocop.
