1
00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:01.964
Yes, Marlin.

2
00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:04.091
I see it. It's beautiful.

3
00:01:04.176 --> 00:01:06.886
So, Coral, when you said
you wanted an ocean view,

4
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.681
you didn't think you were going
to get the whole ocean, did you?

5
00:01:12.476 --> 00:01:13.643
Oh, yeah!

6
00:01:13.727 --> 00:01:17.814
A fish can breathe out here.
Did your man deliver or did he deliver?

7
00:01:17.898 --> 00:01:20.316
-My man delivered.
-It wasn't so easy.

8
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.277
A lot of clownfish
had their eyes on this place.

9
00:01:23.362 --> 00:01:27.031
You better believe they did.
Every single one of them.

10
00:01:27.115 --> 00:01:30.368
You did good
and the neighbourhood is awesome.

11
00:01:40.796 --> 00:01:45.842
-So you do like it, don't you?
-No, no, I really do like it.

12
00:01:45.926 --> 00:01:48.886
But, Marlin, I know that
the Drop Off is desirable,

13
00:01:48.971 --> 00:01:50.888
great schools, amazing view,

14
00:01:50.973 --> 00:01:53.516
but do we really need so much space?

15
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.102
Coral, honey,
these are our kids we're talking about.

16
00:01:56.186 --> 00:01:57.311
They deserve the best.

17
00:01:57.396 --> 00:02:01.691
Look. They'll wake up, poke their
little heads out and see a whale

18
00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:03.901
right by their bedroom window!

19
00:02:04.361 --> 00:02:07.572
-You're going to wake the kids.
-Oh, right. Right.

20
00:02:11.285 --> 00:02:12.535
Look.

21
00:02:13.996 --> 00:02:15.955
They're dreaming.

22
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.376
-We still have to name them.
-All of them? Right now?

23
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.629
All right. We'll name this half Marlin Jr.

24
00:02:23.714 --> 00:02:25.840
and this half Coral Jr.

25
00:02:25.924 --> 00:02:28.384
-Okay, we're done.
-I like Nemo.

26
00:02:28.468 --> 00:02:29.886
Nemo?

27
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.764
We'll name one Nemo,
but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr.

28
00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.767
In a couple of days,
we're going to be parents!

29
00:02:36.852 --> 00:02:37.977
Yeah.

30
00:02:39.146 --> 00:02:41.647
-What if they don't like me?
-Marlin...

31
00:02:41.982 --> 00:02:43.399
There's over 400 eggs.

32
00:02:43.483 --> 00:02:46.652
Odds are one of them
is bound to like you.

33
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.990
What?

34
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.410
-You remember how we met?
-I try not to.

35
00:02:54.494 --> 00:02:55.703
Well, I remember.

36
00:02:55.787 --> 00:02:58.623
Excuse me, miss.
Can you see if I have a hook in my lip?

37
00:02:58.707 --> 00:03:00.917
-Marlin.
-Look closer.

38
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:04.211
-Get away!
-Here he is. Cutie's here!

39
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.507
Where did everybody go?

40
00:03:15.432 --> 00:03:17.099
Coral, get inside the house.

41
00:03:19.394 --> 00:03:22.063
No, don't. They'll be fine.
Just get inside.

42
00:03:22.147 --> 00:03:23.814
You. Right now.

43
00:03:26.485 --> 00:03:27.818
No!

44
00:03:47.047 --> 00:03:48.089
Coral!

45
00:03:54.513 --> 00:03:59.392
Coral?

46
00:04:06.274 --> 00:04:11.445
Coral!

47
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:18.536
Coral?

48
00:04:41.601 --> 00:04:43.686
There, there.

49
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.730
It's okay. Daddy's here.

50
00:04:47.232 --> 00:04:48.941
Daddy's got you.

51
00:04:52.028 --> 00:04:56.198
I promise I will never let
anything happen to you,

52
00:04:56.283 --> 00:04:57.575
Nemo.

53
00:05:35.989 --> 00:05:37.990
First day of school! Wake up!
Come on. First day of school.

54
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.286
I don't want to go to school.

55
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.163
-Not you, Dad. Me.
-Okay.

56
00:05:44.247 --> 00:05:46.248
Get up! Time for school!

57
00:05:47.667 --> 00:05:50.836
-All right, I'm up. It's time for school.
-Oh, boy!

58
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:52.046
Nemo!

59
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.882
-First day of school!
-Don't move.

60
00:05:54.966 --> 00:05:58.469
You'll never get out of there yourself.
I'll do it.

61
00:05:58.553 --> 00:06:00.387
-You feel a break?
-No.

62
00:06:00.472 --> 00:06:03.641
Sometimes fluid is rushing to the area.
Any rushing fluids?

63
00:06:03.725 --> 00:06:06.435
-No.
-How many stripes do I have?

64
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.437
-Answer the question.
-Three.

65
00:06:08.522 --> 00:06:11.899
No! Something's wrong with you.
I have one, two...

66
00:06:11.983 --> 00:06:13.859
Three. That's all I have?

67
00:06:13.944 --> 00:06:15.945
You're okay. How's the lucky fin?

68
00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:18.280
-Lucky.
-Let's see.

69
00:06:20.408 --> 00:06:23.202
Sure you want to go to school this year?

70
00:06:23.286 --> 00:06:26.997
-You can wait five or six years.
-Come on, Dad. It's time for school.

71
00:06:27.666 --> 00:06:29.291
Forgot to brush.

72
00:06:29.376 --> 00:06:31.836
Do you want this anemone to sting you?

73
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.379
-Yes.
-Brush.

74
00:06:34.214 --> 00:06:35.965
-I'm done.
-You missed a spot.

75
00:06:36.049 --> 00:06:37.925
-Where?
-There.

76
00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:40.386
Right there. And here and here.

77
00:06:49.646 --> 00:06:54.608
We're excited. First day of school.
Here we go. We're ready to learn.

78
00:06:54.693 --> 00:06:56.902
What do we have to remember
about the ocean?

79
00:06:56.987 --> 00:06:59.488
-It's not safe.
-That's my boy.

80
00:06:59.573 --> 00:07:04.368
First, we check to see that the coast
is clear. We go out and back in.

81
00:07:04.452 --> 00:07:06.662
Then we go out and back in.

82
00:07:06.746 --> 00:07:09.665
Then one more time. Out and back in.

83
00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:12.418
-If you want to do it four times...
-Dad...

84
00:07:12.502 --> 00:07:14.420
All right. Come on, boy.

85
00:07:16.923 --> 00:07:19.758
Maybe while I'm at school,
I'll see a shark.

86
00:07:19.843 --> 00:07:22.469
-I doubt that.
-Have you ever met a shark?

87
00:07:22.554 --> 00:07:25.222
-No, and I don't plan to.
-How old are sea turtles?

88
00:07:25.307 --> 00:07:27.516
Sea turtles? I don't know.

89
00:07:27.601 --> 00:07:30.019
Sandy Plankton from next door said that

90
00:07:30.103 --> 00:07:34.273
sea turtles live to be
about 100 years old.

91
00:07:34.357 --> 00:07:38.903
If I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him,
after I'm done talking to the shark.

92
00:07:38.987 --> 00:07:41.030
Hold on. Wait to cross.

93
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.658
Hold my fin. Hold my fin.

94
00:07:44.743 --> 00:07:47.995
You're not going to freak out
like you did at the petting zoo.

95
00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:50.623
That snail was about to charge.

96
00:07:51.416 --> 00:07:53.542
I wonder where we're supposed to go.

97
00:07:53.627 --> 00:07:56.754
-Bye, Mom.
-I'll pick you up after school.

98
00:07:58.632 --> 00:08:01.550
Come on, you guys.
Stop it. Give it back.

99
00:08:02.636 --> 00:08:04.637
Come on. We'll try over there.

100
00:08:05.805 --> 00:08:08.641
Excuse me.
Is this where we meet his teacher?

101
00:08:08.725 --> 00:08:12.227
-Look who's out of the anemone.
-Yes, shocking, I know.

102
00:08:12.312 --> 00:08:13.687
-Marty?
-Marlin.

103
00:08:13.772 --> 00:08:14.730
-Bob.
-Ted.

104
00:08:14.814 --> 00:08:16.815
Phil. Hey, you're a clownfish.

105
00:08:17.484 --> 00:08:19.693
You're funny, right? Tell us a joke.

106
00:08:19.778 --> 00:08:22.071
-Yeah.
-Good idea.

107
00:08:22.155 --> 00:08:26.367
That's a misconception. Clownfish are
no funnier than any other fish.

108
00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:28.911
-Come on, Clowny.
-Do something funny.

109
00:08:28.995 --> 00:08:31.246
All right. I know one joke.

110
00:08:32.457 --> 00:08:35.376
There's a mollusk. He walks up to...

111
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.169
Well, he swims up.

112
00:08:37.337 --> 00:08:41.090
Actually, the mollusk isn't moving.
He's in one place.

113
00:08:41.174 --> 00:08:42.591
And then the sea cucumber...

114
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.887
I'm mixed up. There was
a mollusk and a sea cucumber.

115
00:08:46.972 --> 00:08:48.806
None of them were walking...

116
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:52.017
Sheldon!
Get out of Mr Johanssen's yard now!

117
00:08:52.936 --> 00:08:55.104
All right, you kids!

118
00:08:55.188 --> 00:08:57.231
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

119
00:08:57.315 --> 00:08:59.692
Can I go play, too? Can I?

120
00:08:59.776 --> 00:09:02.528
I would feel better if you go play
over on the sponge beds.

121
00:09:07.826 --> 00:09:08.993
That's where I would play.

122
00:09:10.829 --> 00:09:14.081
-What's wrong with his fin?
-He looks funny.

123
00:09:14.165 --> 00:09:17.626
-Hey, what did I do?
-Be nice. It's his first time at school.

124
00:09:17.711 --> 00:09:20.212
He was born with it.
We call it his lucky fin.

125
00:09:20.296 --> 00:09:21.338
Dad...

126
00:09:21.423 --> 00:09:25.175
See this tentacle?
It's shorter than all my other tentacles.

127
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.638
But you can't really tell.
Especially when I twirl them like this.

128
00:09:29.723 --> 00:09:31.724
I'm H2O intolerant.

129
00:09:32.684 --> 00:09:34.226
I'm obnoxious.

130
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.230
Let's name the zones,
the zones, the zones

131
00:09:38.314 --> 00:09:41.025
Let's name the zones of the open sea

132
00:09:41.109 --> 00:09:42.443
Mr Ray!

133
00:09:42.527 --> 00:09:44.570
-Come on, Nemo.
-Stay with me.

134
00:09:44.654 --> 00:09:47.489
There's epipelagic, mesopelagic,
bathyal, abyssopelagic

135
00:09:47.574 --> 00:09:51.076
All the rest are too deep
for you and me to see

136
00:09:51.161 --> 00:09:53.829
I wonder where my class has gone.

137
00:09:53.913 --> 00:09:55.706
We're under here.

138
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:59.501
There you are! Come aboard, explorers.

139
00:09:59.586 --> 00:10:02.129
Knowledge exploring is oh so lyrical

140
00:10:02.213 --> 00:10:04.673
When you think thoughts
that are empirical

141
00:10:04.758 --> 00:10:06.008
Dad, you can go now.

142
00:10:06.092 --> 00:10:09.053
-Well, hello. Who is this?
-I'm Nemo.

143
00:10:09.137 --> 00:10:12.681
Nemo, all new explorers
must answer a science question.

144
00:10:12.766 --> 00:10:15.684
-Okay.
-You live in what kind of home?

145
00:10:15.769 --> 00:10:19.938
In an anemoninny.
Anemonemenemone.

146
00:10:20.023 --> 00:10:22.399
Don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard.

147
00:10:22.484 --> 00:10:24.526
Just so you know, he's got a little fin.

148
00:10:24.611 --> 00:10:28.113
If he's having trouble swimming,
let him take a break. 15 minutes.

149
00:10:28.198 --> 00:10:30.365
Dad, it's time for you to go now.

150
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.534
We're going to stay together.

151
00:10:32.619 --> 00:10:35.245
Okay, class. Optical orbits up front.

152
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:39.708
Remember, we keep our
supraesophageal ganglion to ourselves.

153
00:10:39.793 --> 00:10:42.503
-That means you, Jimmy.
-Oh, man!

154
00:10:43.755 --> 00:10:45.964
-Bye, Nemo.
-Bye, Dad.

155
00:10:46.633 --> 00:10:47.716
Bye, son.

156
00:10:50.428 --> 00:10:52.054
Be safe.

157
00:10:52.138 --> 00:10:54.556
You're doing well for a first-timer.

158
00:10:54.641 --> 00:10:56.892
You can't hold on to them forever,
can you?

159
00:10:56.976 --> 00:11:00.187
I had a tough time when
my eldest went out on the Drop Off.

160
00:11:00.271 --> 00:11:02.815
The Drop Off!
They're going to the Drop Off?

161
00:11:02.899 --> 00:11:04.525
Are you insane?

162
00:11:04.609 --> 00:11:07.486
Why don't we fry them up now
and serve them with chips?

163
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.196
Hey, Marty, calm down.

164
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.073
Don't tell me to be calm, pony-boy.

165
00:11:12.158 --> 00:11:13.826
Pony-boy?

166
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.537
For a clownfish,
he really isn't that funny.

167
00:11:16.621 --> 00:11:17.621
Pity.

168
00:11:20.125 --> 00:11:22.251
Let's name the species,
the species, the species

169
00:11:22.335 --> 00:11:25.170
Let's name the species
that live in the sea

170
00:11:31.094 --> 00:11:33.929
Mollusca and gastropoda, arthropoda,
echinoderma, chordata

171
00:11:34.013 --> 00:11:35.264
And some fish like you and me!

172
00:11:35.348 --> 00:11:37.266
Come on. Sing with me.

173
00:11:46.526 --> 00:11:48.944
Seaweed is cool, seaweed is fun

174
00:11:49.028 --> 00:11:51.029
lt makes its food
from the rays of the sun

175
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:55.826
Okay, the Drop Off.

176
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:59.204
All right, kids.
Feel free to explore, but stay close.

177
00:11:59.706 --> 00:12:01.957
Stromatolitic cyanobacteria! Gather.

178
00:12:02.041 --> 00:12:05.252
An ecosystem contained
in one infinitesimal speck.

179
00:12:07.505 --> 00:12:09.381
Come on. Let's go.

180
00:12:10.049 --> 00:12:11.341
Come on. Sing with me.

181
00:12:11.426 --> 00:12:14.428
There's porifera, coelenterata,
hydrozoa, scyphozoa

182
00:12:14.512 --> 00:12:16.054
Anthozoa, ctenophora, bryozoas three

183
00:12:16.931 --> 00:12:18.849
Hey, guys, wait up.

184
00:12:19.851 --> 00:12:21.226
Whoa!

185
00:12:24.814 --> 00:12:26.398
Cool.

186
00:12:28.568 --> 00:12:30.194
Saved your life!

187
00:12:30.904 --> 00:12:32.821
You guys made me ink.

188
00:12:33.781 --> 00:12:34.990
What's that?

189
00:12:36.826 --> 00:12:39.411
I know what that is.
Sandy Plankton saw one.

190
00:12:40.371 --> 00:12:42.623
He said it was called a butt.

191
00:12:43.583 --> 00:12:46.376
Wow. That's a pretty big butt.

192
00:12:48.004 --> 00:12:51.423
Look at me.
I'm going to go touch the butt.

193
00:12:54.093 --> 00:12:56.386
Oh, yeah? Let's see you get closer.

194
00:12:56.471 --> 00:12:57.763
Okay.

195
00:12:59.224 --> 00:13:00.599
Beat that.

196
00:13:01.142 --> 00:13:03.185
Come on, Nemo. How far can you go?

197
00:13:04.437 --> 00:13:07.564
-My dad says it's not safe.
-Nemo, no!

198
00:13:07.649 --> 00:13:08.774
Dad?

199
00:13:08.858 --> 00:13:10.484
You were about to
swim into open water.

200
00:13:10.568 --> 00:13:11.568
No!

201
00:13:11.653 --> 00:13:13.445
Good thing I was here.

202
00:13:13.529 --> 00:13:15.948
-He wasn't going to go.
-He was too afraid.

203
00:13:16.032 --> 00:13:18.575
-I wasn't.
-This does not concern you.

204
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.120
You're lucky I don't tell your parents.
You can't swim well.

205
00:13:22.205 --> 00:13:25.415
-I can swim fine, Dad, okay?
-No. It's not okay.

206
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.959
You shouldn't be near here.

207
00:13:27.293 --> 00:13:29.628
You'll start school in a year or two.

208
00:13:29.712 --> 00:13:32.798
No. Just because
you're scared of the ocean...

209
00:13:32.882 --> 00:13:34.800
Clearly you're not ready.

210
00:13:34.884 --> 00:13:37.844
You think you can do these things,
but you just can't!

211
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:40.806
I hate you.

212
00:13:42.308 --> 00:13:45.018
There's...

213
00:13:45.103 --> 00:13:46.895
Nothing to see. Gather there.

214
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.274
Anything I can do?
I am a scientist. Is there any problem?

215
00:13:50.358 --> 00:13:53.527
I didn't mean to interrupt.
He isn't a good swimmer.

216
00:13:53.611 --> 00:13:56.780
I think it's too soon
for him to be out here unsupervised.

217
00:13:56.864 --> 00:13:59.074
I can assure you,
he's quite safe with me.

218
00:13:59.158 --> 00:14:00.325
I'm sure he is.

219
00:14:00.618 --> 00:14:03.662
But you have a large class
and he can get lost from sight

220
00:14:03.788 --> 00:14:05.622
if you're not looking.

221
00:14:05.707 --> 00:14:08.500
Oh, my gosh!
Nemo's swimming out to sea.

222
00:14:10.503 --> 00:14:11.670
Nemo!

223
00:14:13.214 --> 00:14:14.756
What do you think you're doing?

224
00:14:16.467 --> 00:14:17.801
You're going to get stuck

225
00:14:17.885 --> 00:14:20.762
and I'm going to have to get you
before another fish does.

226
00:14:21.639 --> 00:14:23.473
Get back here.

227
00:14:23.558 --> 00:14:26.018
I said get back here now!

228
00:14:27.228 --> 00:14:28.812
Stop.

229
00:14:28.896 --> 00:14:30.939
You take one more move, mister...

230
00:14:32.066 --> 00:14:35.319
Don't you dare.
If you put one fin on that boat...

231
00:14:35.403 --> 00:14:36.903
Are you listening to me?

232
00:14:36.988 --> 00:14:39.031
Don't touch the boa...

233
00:14:39.115 --> 00:14:40.115
Nemo!

234
00:14:40.408 --> 00:14:41.783
He touched the butt.

235
00:14:41.868 --> 00:14:44.661
You paddle your little tail back here.

236
00:14:44.746 --> 00:14:47.539
That's right.
You are in big trouble, young man.

237
00:14:47.623 --> 00:14:49.708
Do you hear me? Big...

238
00:14:56.382 --> 00:14:58.467
Daddy, help me!

239
00:14:59.135 --> 00:15:01.053
I'm coming, Nemo.

240
00:15:03.097 --> 00:15:04.639
Get under me, kids.

241
00:15:05.725 --> 00:15:07.392
No! Dad!

242
00:15:15.318 --> 00:15:16.401
Nemo!

243
00:15:20.239 --> 00:15:22.324
Nemo! Nemo, no!

244
00:15:23.576 --> 00:15:24.701
Nemo!

245
00:15:24.786 --> 00:15:25.994
Nemo, Nemo!

246
00:15:26.454 --> 00:15:31.083
No!

247
00:15:41.177 --> 00:15:42.928
Nemo, Nemo!

248
00:15:53.147 --> 00:15:54.481
Hold on!

249
00:16:06.911 --> 00:16:07.953
Oh, no.

250
00:16:08.413 --> 00:16:10.539
No. It's gone. It's gone.

251
00:16:10.623 --> 00:16:12.958
It can't be gone. No. No!

252
00:16:13.042 --> 00:16:15.210
Nemo! Nemo...

253
00:16:15.795 --> 00:16:17.504
Nemo!

254
00:16:17.588 --> 00:16:18.797
No.

255
00:16:20.425 --> 00:16:22.551
Nemo! Nemo!

256
00:16:22.635 --> 00:16:23.677
No.

257
00:16:23.761 --> 00:16:25.220
No. Please, no.

258
00:16:28.057 --> 00:16:29.141
No, no.

259
00:16:31.811 --> 00:16:33.395
Has anybody seen a boat?

260
00:16:33.479 --> 00:16:35.313
Please. A white boat?

261
00:16:35.398 --> 00:16:37.816
My son! My son!

262
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.234
Help me. Please.

263
00:16:39.318 --> 00:16:40.652
Look out!

264
00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:48.076
Sorry. I didn't see you, sir.

265
00:16:48.161 --> 00:16:49.578
Are you okay?

266
00:16:49.662 --> 00:16:51.329
-He's gone.
-There, there.

267
00:16:51.414 --> 00:16:53.081
-He's gone.
-It's all right.

268
00:16:53.166 --> 00:16:55.584
-It'll be okay.
-No, they took him away.

269
00:16:55.668 --> 00:16:57.252
I have to find the boat.

270
00:16:57.336 --> 00:16:59.921
-A boat? I've seen a boat.
-You have?

271
00:17:00.006 --> 00:17:03.049
-And it passed by not too long ago.
-A white one?

272
00:17:03.134 --> 00:17:05.177
-Hi. I'm Dory.
-Where? Which way?

273
00:17:06.053 --> 00:17:08.263
It went this way.

274
00:17:08.347 --> 00:17:10.599
-Follow me.
-Thank you.

275
00:17:10.683 --> 00:17:12.058
Thank you so much.

276
00:17:12.143 --> 00:17:13.643
No problem.

277
00:17:40.213 --> 00:17:41.296
Wait.

278
00:17:48.304 --> 00:17:52.349
Quit it. I'm trying to swim here.
The ocean isn't big enough for you?

279
00:17:52.433 --> 00:17:54.559
You got a problem, buddy?

280
00:17:54.644 --> 00:17:55.894
Do you? Do you?

281
00:17:55.978 --> 00:17:58.104
Want a piece of me? Yeah.

282
00:17:58.189 --> 00:17:59.731
I'm scared now!

283
00:17:59.815 --> 00:18:01.816
-Wait.
-Stop following me, okay?

284
00:18:01.901 --> 00:18:04.986
What? You're showing me
which way the boat went.

285
00:18:05.071 --> 00:18:08.740
A boat? I've seen a boat.
It passed by not too long ago.

286
00:18:08.824 --> 00:18:11.743
It went this way. Follow me.

287
00:18:11.827 --> 00:18:13.828
Wait a minute. What is going on?

288
00:18:13.913 --> 00:18:15.956
You already told me
which way the boat was going.

289
00:18:16.624 --> 00:18:19.209
I did? Oh, no.

290
00:18:19.293 --> 00:18:23.088
If this is some kind ofjoke,
it's not funny and I know funny.

291
00:18:23.172 --> 00:18:27.384
-I'm a clownfish.
-No, it's not. I'm so sorry.

292
00:18:27.885 --> 00:18:30.845
See, I suffer from
short-term memory loss.

293
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.265
Short-term memory loss.

294
00:18:33.349 --> 00:18:35.183
-I don't believe this.
-No.

295
00:18:35.268 --> 00:18:38.770
I forget things almost instantly.
It runs in my family.

296
00:18:38.854 --> 00:18:40.605
At least I think it does.

297
00:18:42.942 --> 00:18:44.442
Where are they?

298
00:18:49.073 --> 00:18:50.198
Can I help you?

299
00:18:51.117 --> 00:18:53.493
Something's wrong with you. Really.

300
00:18:53.578 --> 00:18:55.370
You're wasting my time.

301
00:18:55.454 --> 00:18:57.330
I have to find my son.

302
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:01.793
Hello.

303
00:19:02.628 --> 00:19:03.920
Well, hi!

304
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.423
Name's Bruce.

305
00:19:07.133 --> 00:19:09.175
It's all right. I understand.

306
00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.678
Why trust a shark, right?

307
00:19:19.854 --> 00:19:24.399
So, what's a couple of bites like you
doing out so late?

308
00:19:24.483 --> 00:19:26.443
Nothing. We're not even out.

309
00:19:26.527 --> 00:19:27.777
Great.

310
00:19:27.862 --> 00:19:32.365
Then how would you morsels like to
come to a little get-together I'm having?

311
00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:36.661
-You mean like a party?
-Yeah, right. A party.

312
00:19:36.746 --> 00:19:39.914
-What do you say?
-I love parties. That sounds like fun.

313
00:19:39.999 --> 00:19:43.585
Parties are fun and it's tempting,
but we can't because...

314
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:46.087
Come on. I insist.

315
00:19:46.172 --> 00:19:48.673
Okay. That's all that matters.

316
00:19:52.136 --> 00:19:54.471
Look. Balloons. It is a party.

317
00:19:55.348 --> 00:19:59.476
Mind your distance, though.
Those balloons can be a bit dodgy.

318
00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.311
You wouldn't want one of them to pop.

319
00:20:16.494 --> 00:20:17.952
Anchor! Chum!

320
00:20:19.038 --> 00:20:20.789
There you are, Bruce. Finally.

321
00:20:20.873 --> 00:20:23.667
-We got company.
-It's about time, mate.

322
00:20:23.751 --> 00:20:26.628
We've gone through the snacks
and I'm starving.

323
00:20:26.712 --> 00:20:28.838
We almost had to have
a feeding frenzy.

324
00:20:28.923 --> 00:20:30.548
Let's get this over with.

325
00:20:32.843 --> 00:20:36.137
Right then. The meeting has
officially come to order.

326
00:20:36.222 --> 00:20:37.847
Let us all say the pledge.

327
00:20:37.932 --> 00:20:39.808
I am a nice shark,

328
00:20:39.892 --> 00:20:42.268
not a mindless eating machine.

329
00:20:42.353 --> 00:20:47.023
If I am to change this image,
I must first change myself.

330
00:20:47.233 --> 00:20:49.776
Fish are friends, not food.

331
00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.486
Except stinking dolphins.

332
00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.447
Dolphins!
Yeah, they think they're so cute.

333
00:20:54.532 --> 00:20:58.660
Look, I'm a flipping little dolphin.
Let me flip for you. Ain't I something?

334
00:20:58.744 --> 00:21:02.288
Today's meeting is step five:
Bring a Fish Friend.

335
00:21:02.373 --> 00:21:04.582
-Do you all have your friends?
-Got mine.

336
00:21:06.919 --> 00:21:09.087
-Hey there!
-How about you, Chum?

337
00:21:09.171 --> 00:21:12.882
Well, I seem to have misplaced my

338
00:21:12.967 --> 00:21:14.592
friend.

339
00:21:15.428 --> 00:21:16.636
It's all right, Chum.

340
00:21:16.721 --> 00:21:19.639
Help yourself to one of my friends.

341
00:21:19.724 --> 00:21:23.184
Thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum.

342
00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:26.896
I'll start the testimonies.
Hello. My name is Bruce.

343
00:21:26.981 --> 00:21:28.189
Hello, Bruce.

344
00:21:28.274 --> 00:21:31.484
It has been three weeks
since my last fish, on my honour,

345
00:21:31.569 --> 00:21:33.862
or may I be chopped up
and made into soup.

346
00:21:34.572 --> 00:21:36.740
-You're an inspiration to us.
-Amen.

347
00:21:37.992 --> 00:21:40.702
-Right, then. Who's next?
-Pick me. Pick me.

348
00:21:40.786 --> 00:21:42.620
The little sheila down the front.

349
00:21:43.372 --> 00:21:44.956
Come on up here.

350
00:21:46.208 --> 00:21:47.625
Hi. I'm Dory.

351
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.252
Hello, Dory.

352
00:21:49.336 --> 00:21:52.672
And... Well, I don't think
I've ever eaten a fish.

353
00:21:54.133 --> 00:21:56.801
-Hey, that's incredible.
-Good on you, mate!

354
00:21:57.428 --> 00:21:58.887
I'm glad I got that off my chest.

355
00:21:58.971 --> 00:22:03.183
Anyone else? How about you, mate?
What's your problem?

356
00:22:03.267 --> 00:22:05.602
Me? I don't have a problem.

357
00:22:06.103 --> 00:22:08.146
-Okay.
-Denial.

358
00:22:08.564 --> 00:22:10.523
Just start with your name.

359
00:22:10.608 --> 00:22:12.859
Okay. Hello.

360
00:22:13.235 --> 00:22:15.987
My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish.

361
00:22:16.071 --> 00:22:19.574
-A clownfish? Really?
-Go on. Tell us a joke.

362
00:22:19.658 --> 00:22:20.825
I love jokes.

363
00:22:21.118 --> 00:22:24.120
I actually do know
one that's pretty good.

364
00:22:25.164 --> 00:22:28.625
There was this mollusk
and he walks up to a sea cucumber.

365
00:22:28.709 --> 00:22:32.128
Normally they don't talk,
but in a joke, everyone talks.

366
00:22:32.213 --> 00:22:35.215
The sea mollusk
says to the cucumber...

367
00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.010
Daddy!

368
00:22:39.553 --> 00:22:42.847
Nemo!

369
00:22:43.599 --> 00:22:45.934
-I don't get it.
-For a clownfish he's not that funny.

370
00:22:46.018 --> 00:22:50.480
No, he's my son.
He was taken by these divers.

371
00:22:51.148 --> 00:22:53.024
You poor fish.

372
00:22:53.108 --> 00:22:56.402
-Humans. Think they own everything.
-Probably American.

373
00:22:56.487 --> 00:23:00.532
There is a father
looking for his little boy.

374
00:23:00.991 --> 00:23:02.659
What do these markings mean?

375
00:23:02.743 --> 00:23:06.621
-I never knew my father.
-Come here.

376
00:23:06.705 --> 00:23:08.832
-We're all mates here.
-I can't read human.

377
00:23:08.916 --> 00:23:12.001
Then we've got to find a fish
that can read this. Look. Sharks!

378
00:23:12.545 --> 00:23:14.420
-Guys.
-No, Dory.

379
00:23:14.505 --> 00:23:16.881
-That's mine. Give it back.
-Cut it out.

380
00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:20.635
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

381
00:23:20.719 --> 00:23:23.555
You really clocked me there.
Am I bleeding?

382
00:23:25.057 --> 00:23:27.058
Dory, are you oka...

383
00:23:30.229 --> 00:23:31.729
That's good.

384
00:23:32.231 --> 00:23:33.606
Intervention!

385
00:23:34.358 --> 00:23:37.318
-Just a bite.
-You hold it together, mate.

386
00:23:37.403 --> 00:23:40.238
-Fish are friends, not food.
-Food!

387
00:23:41.073 --> 00:23:42.824
Dory, look out.

388
00:23:42.908 --> 00:23:45.785
I'm having fish tonight.

389
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:47.161
Remember the steps, mate.

390
00:23:53.002 --> 00:23:54.210
Just one bite.

391
00:23:58.757 --> 00:23:59.799
G'day.

392
00:24:03.596 --> 00:24:06.097
There's no way out.
There's got to be a way to escape.

393
00:24:08.726 --> 00:24:11.060
-Who is it?
-Help me find a way out.

394
00:24:11.145 --> 00:24:13.938
Sorry. You'll have to come back later.
We're trying to escape.

395
00:24:14.857 --> 00:24:17.442
There's no way out.
There's got to be a way out.

396
00:24:17.526 --> 00:24:21.696
Here's something. "Es-ca-pé."
I wonder what that means.

397
00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.865
-It's spelled just like the word "escape."
-Let's go.

398
00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:27.035
Here's Brucie!

399
00:24:27.536 --> 00:24:31.164
-Wait a minute. You can read?
-I can read? That's right!

400
00:24:31.248 --> 00:24:32.749
Then here. Read this now.

401
00:24:34.793 --> 00:24:37.754
He doesn't mean it.
He never even knew his father.

402
00:24:37.838 --> 00:24:39.881
Don't fall off the wagon.

403
00:24:43.636 --> 00:24:45.428
Oh, no! It's blocked.

404
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:51.100
No, Bruce!

405
00:24:51.435 --> 00:24:53.645
Sorry about... Bruce, mate.

406
00:24:53.729 --> 00:24:55.897
He's really... A nice guy.

407
00:24:55.981 --> 00:24:57.565
I need to get that mask.

408
00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:59.108
You want that mask? Okay.

409
00:24:59.193 --> 00:25:01.569
No, no, no, no!

410
00:25:02.571 --> 00:25:04.197
Quick. Grab the mask.

411
00:25:08.953 --> 00:25:11.245
Oh, no. Bruce.

412
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:12.497
What?

413
00:25:14.667 --> 00:25:17.418
Swim away!

414
00:25:17.503 --> 00:25:18.920
Is the party over?

415
00:25:28.806 --> 00:25:30.098
Nice.

416
00:25:33.769 --> 00:25:35.061
Dad!

417
00:25:37.731 --> 00:25:39.107
Daddy?

418
00:26:02.131 --> 00:26:03.297
Barbara.

419
00:26:03.382 --> 00:26:05.174
Prep for his anterior crown,
would you, please?

420
00:26:05.551 --> 00:26:08.678
-And I'll need more cotton rolls.
-All right.

421
00:26:11.724 --> 00:26:12.807
Hello, little fella.

422
00:26:14.226 --> 00:26:15.226
Beauty, isn't he?

423
00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:18.813
I found that guy struggling for life
and I saved him.

424
00:26:18.897 --> 00:26:20.982
Has that Novocain kicked in yet?

425
00:26:25.195 --> 00:26:26.446
Bubbles!

426
00:26:30.034 --> 00:26:32.952
-My bubbles.
-He likes bubbles.

427
00:26:46.341 --> 00:26:50.011
Slow down, little fella.
There's nothing to worry about.

428
00:26:50.095 --> 00:26:52.305
-He's scared to death.
-I want to go home.

429
00:26:53.223 --> 00:26:54.640
Do you know where my dad is?

430
00:26:54.725 --> 00:26:57.351
Your dad's probably
back at the pet store.

431
00:26:57.436 --> 00:26:58.770
Pet store?

432
00:26:58.854 --> 00:27:01.981
-Like I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.
-Pet Palace.

433
00:27:02.066 --> 00:27:03.483
-Fish-O-Rama.
-Mail order.

434
00:27:03.567 --> 00:27:04.817
eBay.

435
00:27:04.902 --> 00:27:07.361
-Which one is it?
-I'm from the ocean.

436
00:27:07.446 --> 00:27:09.489
The ocean. The ocean!

437
00:27:11.158 --> 00:27:14.077
He hasn't been decontaminated yet.
Jacques!

438
00:27:14.161 --> 00:27:15.495
Clean him!

439
00:27:17.081 --> 00:27:18.623
Ocean.

440
00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:22.960
Voilà. He is clean.

441
00:27:25.964 --> 00:27:29.092
Wow. The big blue. What's it like?

442
00:27:29.635 --> 00:27:31.928
Big and blue?

443
00:27:32.012 --> 00:27:33.054
I knew it.

444
00:27:33.138 --> 00:27:36.557
If there's anything you need,
ask your Auntie Deb. That's me.

445
00:27:36.642 --> 00:27:41.229
If I'm not around you can always
talk to my sister, Flo. Hi. How are you?

446
00:27:41.313 --> 00:27:44.440
Don't listen to anything my sister says.
She's nuts.

447
00:27:45.651 --> 00:27:48.611
-Can't hear you, Peach.
-I said we got a live one.

448
00:27:48.695 --> 00:27:50.071
-Yes!
-Boy, oh, boy.

449
00:27:50.155 --> 00:27:52.323
-What have we got?
-Root canal.

450
00:27:52.407 --> 00:27:53.658
It's not going to be pretty.

451
00:27:55.494 --> 00:27:56.911
-Clamp installed?
-Yup.

452
00:27:56.995 --> 00:28:00.414
-What did he use to open?
-Glidden drill. He favours that one.

453
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:03.417
I can't see, Flo.

454
00:28:05.671 --> 00:28:08.256
-Schilder Technique.
-That's a Hedstrom file.

455
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.800
That's not a Hedstrom file.
That's a K-Flex.

456
00:28:10.884 --> 00:28:13.886
It's got a teardrop cross section.
A Hedstrom.

457
00:28:13.971 --> 00:28:16.639
-K-Flex!
-Hedstrom!

458
00:28:16.723 --> 00:28:18.808
There I go. Little help. Over here.

459
00:28:18.892 --> 00:28:20.768
I'll go deflate him.

460
00:28:22.729 --> 00:28:24.981
All right. Go ahead and rinse.

461
00:28:25.941 --> 00:28:28.359
The human mouth
is a disgusting place.

462
00:28:31.196 --> 00:28:32.822
-Nigel.
-What did I miss?

463
00:28:32.906 --> 00:28:35.908
-Root canal. A doozy.
-What did he use to open?

464
00:28:35.993 --> 00:28:37.660
-Glidden drill.
-He favours it.

465
00:28:37.744 --> 00:28:40.913
Hope he doesn't get surplus sealer
at the portal terminus.

466
00:28:40.998 --> 00:28:43.958
-Hello. Who's this?
-New guy.

467
00:28:44.042 --> 00:28:46.627
-The dentist took him off the reef.
-An outie.

468
00:28:46.712 --> 00:28:49.463
From my neck of the woods?
Sorry if I took a snap at you.

469
00:28:49.548 --> 00:28:51.799
Fish got to swim. Birds got to eat.

470
00:28:51.884 --> 00:28:56.262
No, no. Those aren't your fish.
They're my fish. Come on. Go. Shoo.

471
00:28:59.016 --> 00:29:02.268
The picture broke.
This here's Darla. She's my niece.

472
00:29:02.352 --> 00:29:03.394
Going to be eight this week.

473
00:29:03.478 --> 00:29:06.647
Hey, little fella.
Say hello to your new mummy.

474
00:29:06.732 --> 00:29:09.150
She's going to be here Friday
to pick you up.

475
00:29:09.234 --> 00:29:11.068
You're her present.

476
00:29:11.695 --> 00:29:13.112
It's our little secret.

477
00:29:13.197 --> 00:29:14.488
Well, Mr Tucker,

478
00:29:14.573 --> 00:29:17.909
while that sets up, I'm going to
go see a man about a wallaby.

479
00:29:19.536 --> 00:29:20.661
Darla!

480
00:29:20.746 --> 00:29:24.415
-What's wrong with her?
-She wouldn't stop shaking the bag.

481
00:29:25.709 --> 00:29:28.961
-Poor Chuckles.
-He was her present last year.

482
00:29:29.046 --> 00:29:31.756
Hitched a ride on the porcelain express.

483
00:29:33.425 --> 00:29:35.301
She's a fish killer.

484
00:29:36.261 --> 00:29:39.889
I can't go with that girl.
I have to get back to my dad.

485
00:29:41.016 --> 00:29:44.268
-Daddy! Help me!
-He's stuck.

486
00:29:49.524 --> 00:29:51.275
Nobody touch him.

487
00:29:57.241 --> 00:29:58.532
Can you help me?

488
00:29:58.617 --> 00:30:01.953
No. You got yourself in there,
you can get yourself out.

489
00:30:02.037 --> 00:30:04.789
-Gill...
-I just want to see him do it, okay?

490
00:30:04.873 --> 00:30:08.376
Calm down. Alternate wiggling
your fins and your tail.

491
00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:11.379
I can't. I have a bad fin.

492
00:30:11.463 --> 00:30:13.172
Never stopped me.

493
00:30:17.552 --> 00:30:19.804
Just think about what you need to do.

494
00:30:24.226 --> 00:30:25.393
Come on.

495
00:30:29.731 --> 00:30:30.731
Perfect.

496
00:30:30.816 --> 00:30:33.651
-You did it.
-Good squirming.

497
00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:37.947
Wow, from the ocean!
Just like you, Gill.

498
00:30:38.031 --> 00:30:39.240
Yeah.

499
00:30:40.075 --> 00:30:43.286
I've seen that look before.
What are you thinking about?

500
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:48.332
I'm thinking tonight we give
the kid a proper reception.

501
00:30:48.834 --> 00:30:51.711
-So, kid, you got a name or what?
-Nemo.

502
00:30:51.795 --> 00:30:53.212
I'm Nemo.

503
00:30:54.381 --> 00:30:58.134
Nemo.

504
00:31:02.848 --> 00:31:04.849
You going to eat that?

505
00:31:15.861 --> 00:31:17.820
Careful of that hammer.

506
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:28.664
-Dory!
-Sea-Monkey has my money.

507
00:31:28.749 --> 00:31:31.000
Wake up. Get up.

508
00:31:31.084 --> 00:31:33.669
-Come on.
-Yes, I'm a natural blue.

509
00:31:33.754 --> 00:31:35.546
-Get up!
-Look out. Sharks eat fish!

510
00:32:00.072 --> 00:32:01.572
Wow. Dusty.

511
00:32:02.366 --> 00:32:04.450
The mask. Where's the mask?

512
00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:07.453
No! The mask! Get it!

513
00:32:07.537 --> 00:32:09.455
Get the mask! Get it!

514
00:32:19.674 --> 00:32:21.258
Keeps going on, doesn't it?

515
00:32:21.343 --> 00:32:23.177
Echo! Echo!

516
00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:26.305
-What are you doing?
-I've lost the mask.

517
00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:28.307
-Did you drop it?
-You dropped it!

518
00:32:28.392 --> 00:32:30.935
That was my only chance of
finding my son. Now it's gone.

519
00:32:35.107 --> 00:32:37.358
Hey, Mr Grumpy Gills.

520
00:32:38.777 --> 00:32:41.320
-When you're down, know what to do?
-I don't want to know.

521
00:32:41.405 --> 00:32:43.697
Just keep swimming.

522
00:32:43.782 --> 00:32:46.367
Just keep swimming,
swimming, swimming

523
00:32:46.451 --> 00:32:48.702
What do we do? We swim

524
00:32:48.787 --> 00:32:50.538
Dory, no singing.

525
00:32:51.248 --> 00:32:53.332
l love to swim

526
00:32:53.417 --> 00:32:57.002
And when you want to swim
you want to...

527
00:32:57.087 --> 00:33:00.047
I'm going to get stuck with that song.
It's in my head!

528
00:33:00.132 --> 00:33:01.298
Sorry.

529
00:33:03.385 --> 00:33:05.428
-See anything?
-Something's got me!

530
00:33:05.512 --> 00:33:07.471
-That was me. Sorry.
-Who's that?

531
00:33:07.556 --> 00:33:09.807
Who could it be? It's me.

532
00:33:09.891 --> 00:33:12.518
Are... Are you my conscience?

533
00:33:13.645 --> 00:33:15.729
Yeah. I'm your conscience.

534
00:33:15.814 --> 00:33:18.649
We haven't spoken for a while.
How are you?

535
00:33:18.733 --> 00:33:20.776
-Can't complain.
-Good.

536
00:33:20.861 --> 00:33:24.363
Now, Dory, I want you to tell me,
do you see anything?

537
00:33:24.448 --> 00:33:26.323
I see a...

538
00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.826
-I see a light.
-A light?

539
00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:31.036
Yeah. Over there.

540
00:33:31.121 --> 00:33:32.830
Hey, conscience, am I dead?

541
00:33:32.914 --> 00:33:34.415
I see it, too.

542
00:33:41.965 --> 00:33:43.382
What is it?

543
00:33:44.176 --> 00:33:46.844
It's so pretty!

544
00:33:48.763 --> 00:33:50.181
I...

545
00:33:50.265 --> 00:33:52.516
I'm feeling happy.

546
00:33:53.685 --> 00:33:56.979
Which is a big deal for me.

547
00:33:57.063 --> 00:33:58.814
I want to touch it.

548
00:34:00.108 --> 00:34:02.485
Hey, come back. Come on back here.

549
00:34:02.569 --> 00:34:06.363
I'm going to get you.

550
00:34:06.448 --> 00:34:08.282
I'm going to swim with you

551
00:34:08.366 --> 00:34:11.118
I'm going to be your best friend

552
00:34:11.203 --> 00:34:12.536
Good feeling's gone.

553
00:34:19.961 --> 00:34:22.087
I can't see.
I don't know where I'm going.

554
00:34:24.132 --> 00:34:26.050
-The mask!
-What mask?

555
00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:29.303
Okay. I can't see a thing.

556
00:34:30.055 --> 00:34:31.096
Whoa, geez.

557
00:34:31.181 --> 00:34:33.224
-Look. A mask.
-Read it!

558
00:34:34.392 --> 00:34:38.312
I'm sorry, but if you could bring it
a little closer. I need the light.

559
00:34:38.396 --> 00:34:40.481
That's great. Keep it right there.

560
00:34:40.565 --> 00:34:43.400
-Just read it!
-Okay, okay.

561
00:34:43.485 --> 00:34:44.944
Mr Bossy.

562
00:34:45.779 --> 00:34:47.488
"P." Okay. P.

563
00:34:47.572 --> 00:34:49.156
"Sher..."

564
00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:51.825
P. Sher... P. Shirley...

565
00:34:51.910 --> 00:34:53.410
P not Shirley.

566
00:34:54.621 --> 00:34:56.497
The first line's "P. Sherman."

567
00:34:56.581 --> 00:34:59.166
"P. Sherman" doesn't make any sense!

568
00:34:59.251 --> 00:35:00.626
Second line.

569
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:02.253
"42..."

570
00:35:05.131 --> 00:35:07.049
Light, please.

571
00:35:07.133 --> 00:35:10.761
"Walla... Wallaby."

572
00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:15.849
The second line's "42 Wallaby Way."

573
00:35:15.934 --> 00:35:19.019
Just finish up. Speed read.
No pressure.

574
00:35:19.104 --> 00:35:22.106
There's a lot of pressure!
Take a guess, with pressure.

575
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:24.608
-Sydney. It's Sydney!
-Duck!

576
00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.739
I'm dead. I'm dead.

577
00:35:30.824 --> 00:35:32.616
I died. I'm dead.

578
00:35:40.917 --> 00:35:42.543
We did it, we did it

579
00:35:42.627 --> 00:35:44.295
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

580
00:35:44.379 --> 00:35:47.548
No eating here tonight,
eating here tonight

581
00:35:47.632 --> 00:35:50.384
No eating here tonight
You're on a diet

582
00:35:50.468 --> 00:35:53.345
Dory. What did it say?
What did the mask say?

583
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:55.973
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

584
00:35:56.057 --> 00:35:59.435
I remembered what it said!
I forget things, but I remembered it.

585
00:35:59.519 --> 00:36:01.562
-P. Sherman...
-Where is that?

586
00:36:01.646 --> 00:36:04.189
I don't know. But who cares?
I remembered.

587
00:36:05.734 --> 00:36:09.361
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
I remembered it again!

588
00:36:38.642 --> 00:36:40.059
Nemo.

589
00:36:41.019 --> 00:36:42.728
Nemo!

590
00:36:48.526 --> 00:36:49.985
Follow me.

591
00:37:47.919 --> 00:37:49.253
State your name.

592
00:37:50.255 --> 00:37:51.338
Nemo.

593
00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.799
Brother Bloat, proceed.

594
00:37:55.427 --> 00:37:58.804
Nemo, newcomer of orange and white.

595
00:37:59.055 --> 00:38:03.308
You have been called forth to the
summit of Mount Wannahockaloogie

596
00:38:03.393 --> 00:38:08.105
to join with us
in the fraternal bonds of tankhood.

597
00:38:09.816 --> 00:38:12.192
-We want you in our club, kid.
-Really?

598
00:38:12.277 --> 00:38:16.029
If you are able to swim through

599
00:38:16.114 --> 00:38:19.616
the Ring of Fire!

600
00:38:23.705 --> 00:38:27.082
Turn on the Ring of Fire.
You said you could do it.

601
00:38:27.167 --> 00:38:28.959
The Ring of Fire!

602
00:38:31.337 --> 00:38:33.213
Bubbles. Let me...

603
00:38:41.055 --> 00:38:43.891
Isn't there another way? He's just a boy.

604
00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:59.364
From this moment on,
you will now be known as Sharkbait.

605
00:38:59.449 --> 00:39:00.741
Sharkbait!

606
00:39:00.825 --> 00:39:02.534
Welcome, Brother Sharkbait.

607
00:39:02.619 --> 00:39:03.827
Sharkbait.

608
00:39:03.912 --> 00:39:06.663
-Enough with the Sharkbait.
-Sharkbait...

609
00:39:07.832 --> 00:39:10.083
-Sharkbait's one of us now.
-Agreed.

610
00:39:10.168 --> 00:39:13.587
We can't send him to his death.
Darla's coming in five days.

611
00:39:13.671 --> 00:39:15.172
So what are we going to do?

612
00:39:16.424 --> 00:39:18.133
I'll tell you.

613
00:39:18.218 --> 00:39:20.928
We're going to get him out of here.
We'll help him escape.

614
00:39:21.012 --> 00:39:23.472
-Escape? Really?
-We're all going to escape.

615
00:39:23.765 --> 00:39:26.141
Not another one of your escape plans.

616
00:39:26.226 --> 00:39:28.268
Sorry, but they never work.

617
00:39:28.353 --> 00:39:29.812
Yeah, why should this be any different?

618
00:39:30.313 --> 00:39:33.273
-'Cause we've got him.
-Me?

619
00:39:33.358 --> 00:39:35.025
-You see that filter?
-Yeah.

620
00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:38.821
You're the only one who can
get in and out of that thing.

621
00:39:38.905 --> 00:39:43.116
We need you to take a pebble
inside there and jam the gears.

622
00:39:43.201 --> 00:39:46.995
You do that and this tank's going to
get filthier by the minute.

623
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.748
Soon the dentist
will have to clean the tank.

624
00:39:49.833 --> 00:39:53.961
When he does, he'll take us out of
the tank, put us in individual baggies,

625
00:39:54.045 --> 00:39:56.964
then we'll roll down the counter,
out of the window,

626
00:39:57.048 --> 00:40:00.551
off the awning, into the bushes,
across the street and into the harbour.

627
00:40:01.803 --> 00:40:03.220
It's foolproof.

628
00:40:03.763 --> 00:40:06.306
-Who's with me?
-I.

629
00:40:06.391 --> 00:40:08.225
I think you're nuts.

630
00:40:08.601 --> 00:40:11.562
No offence, kid,
but you're not the best swimmer.

631
00:40:11.646 --> 00:40:14.398
He's fine. He can do this.

632
00:40:14.482 --> 00:40:17.609
So, Sharkbait, what do you think?

633
00:40:17.694 --> 00:40:18.902
Let's do it!

634
00:40:23.491 --> 00:40:26.618
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Where are you going?

635
00:40:26.703 --> 00:40:28.996
To P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

636
00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.415
If you ask where I'm going, I'll tell you.

637
00:40:31.499 --> 00:40:36.837
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Where? I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

638
00:40:36.921 --> 00:40:40.132
Excuse me. Excuse me.

639
00:40:40.216 --> 00:40:42.551
Hi. Do you know how to get... Hello?

640
00:40:42.635 --> 00:40:45.387
Wait. Can you tell me... Hey!

641
00:40:45.471 --> 00:40:46.847
Hold it!

642
00:40:46.931 --> 00:40:48.891
Wait a minute. I'm trying to talk to you.

643
00:40:49.684 --> 00:40:51.518
Okay, fellas. Come back here.

644
00:40:51.603 --> 00:40:55.439
One quick question. I need to...
And they're gone again.

645
00:40:56.441 --> 00:40:58.859
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

646
00:40:58.943 --> 00:41:01.111
Why do I have to tell you again?

647
00:41:01.195 --> 00:41:04.698
-I don't get tired of it.
-All right, here's the thing.

648
00:41:05.617 --> 00:41:09.995
I think it's best
if I carry on from here by...

649
00:41:11.164 --> 00:41:13.457
-By myself.
-Okay.

650
00:41:13.541 --> 00:41:15.083
You know. Alone.

651
00:41:15.168 --> 00:41:20.088
Without... Well, not without you,
but I don't want you with me.

652
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:24.259
I don't want to hurt your feelings.

653
00:41:24.344 --> 00:41:27.054
-You want me to leave?
-Well, not... Yes. Yeah.

654
00:41:27.138 --> 00:41:29.723
I just can't afford any more delays.

655
00:41:29.807 --> 00:41:32.684
You're one of
those fish that cause delays.

656
00:41:32.769 --> 00:41:35.812
Sometimes it's a good thing.
There's a group of fish.

657
00:41:35.897 --> 00:41:38.357
-They're delay fish.
-You mean...

658
00:41:39.192 --> 00:41:42.694
-You mean you don't like me?
-Of course I like you.

659
00:41:42.779 --> 00:41:45.238
Because I like you
I don't want to be with you.

660
00:41:45.323 --> 00:41:47.491
It's a complicated emotion.

661
00:41:48.993 --> 00:41:51.328
Don't cry. I like you.

662
00:41:51.412 --> 00:41:52.537
Hey, you!

663
00:41:53.289 --> 00:41:55.624
Lady, is this guy bothering you?

664
00:41:55.708 --> 00:41:59.628
-I don't remember. Were you?
-No, no. We're just...

665
00:41:59.712 --> 00:42:01.588
Do you guys know how I can get...

666
00:42:01.673 --> 00:42:05.384
We're talking to the lady, not you.
You like impressions?

667
00:42:07.053 --> 00:42:09.972
Okay.
Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen.

668
00:42:10.056 --> 00:42:11.765
What are we? Take a guess.

669
00:42:11.849 --> 00:42:14.893
-I've seen one of those.
-I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.

670
00:42:15.019 --> 00:42:16.937
-Wait.
-It's a swordfish.

671
00:42:17.021 --> 00:42:19.606
Hey, clown-boy, let the lady guess.

672
00:42:20.316 --> 00:42:21.608
Where's the butter?

673
00:42:22.151 --> 00:42:23.944
-It's on the tip of my tongue.
-Lobster.

674
00:42:24.028 --> 00:42:25.445
-Saw that.
-What?

675
00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:27.572
-Lots of legs.
-Clam?

676
00:42:27.657 --> 00:42:28.865
Close enough.

677
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:31.410
lt's a whale of a tale I'll tell you, lad

678
00:42:31.494 --> 00:42:33.745
-They're good.
-Somebody give me directions?

679
00:42:34.497 --> 00:42:37.624
"Would somebody give me directions?"

680
00:42:37.709 --> 00:42:40.043
-I'm serious.
-Blah, blah, me, me.

681
00:42:40.128 --> 00:42:41.586
Blah, blah, blah, me, me.

682
00:42:41.671 --> 00:42:43.255
Thank you.

683
00:42:43.339 --> 00:42:45.549
Oh, dear. Hey, come back.

684
00:42:46.467 --> 00:42:48.468
What's the matter?

685
00:42:48.553 --> 00:42:50.679
While they're doing impressions,

686
00:42:50.763 --> 00:42:52.305
I am miles from home

687
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:54.433
with a fish that can't even
remember her own name.

688
00:42:54.642 --> 00:42:57.269
-I bet that's frustrating.
-My son is out there.

689
00:42:57.353 --> 00:42:59.271
-Your son Chico?
-Nemo.

690
00:42:59.355 --> 00:43:02.983
It doesn't matter. 'Cause no fish
in this ocean is going to help me.

691
00:43:03.067 --> 00:43:04.735
I'm helping you.

692
00:43:06.696 --> 00:43:08.405
Wait right here.

693
00:43:09.741 --> 00:43:11.825
-Guys.
-Is he bothering you again?

694
00:43:11.909 --> 00:43:13.493
No, he's a good guy.

695
00:43:13.578 --> 00:43:15.954
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.

696
00:43:16.039 --> 00:43:18.540
Heard of P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

697
00:43:18.624 --> 00:43:21.001
Sydney? Oh, sure.

698
00:43:21.085 --> 00:43:24.004
Ted here's got relatives in Sydney.
Don't you, Ted?

699
00:43:24.088 --> 00:43:27.466
-Sure do.
-Hey, they know Sydney!

700
00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:31.178
-You wouldn't know how to get there?
-Follow the EAC.

701
00:43:31.262 --> 00:43:33.847
That's East Australian Current.

702
00:43:33.931 --> 00:43:37.017
Big current. You can't miss it. It's in

703
00:43:37.101 --> 00:43:38.560
that direction.

704
00:43:38.644 --> 00:43:41.188
Then you got to follow that for about...

705
00:43:41.272 --> 00:43:44.024
What do you guys think?
Three leagues?

706
00:43:44.108 --> 00:43:47.194
That baby's going to
float you right past Sydney.

707
00:43:47.278 --> 00:43:48.779
Great! That's great!

708
00:43:48.863 --> 00:43:50.906
-Dory, you did it.
-Oh, please.

709
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:53.200
I'm just your little helper. Helping along.

710
00:43:53.284 --> 00:43:55.535
-Fellas, thank you.
-Don't mention it.

711
00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:58.080
Just loosen up. Okay, buddy?

712
00:43:58.164 --> 00:44:01.249
You guys! You really nailed him. Bye.

713
00:44:01.334 --> 00:44:02.918
-Ma'am. One more thing.
-Yes?

714
00:44:03.002 --> 00:44:06.630
When you come to this trench,
swim through it, not over it.

715
00:44:06.714 --> 00:44:09.800
Trench. Through it.
Not over it. I'll remember.

716
00:44:09.884 --> 00:44:11.134
Hey!

717
00:44:13.387 --> 00:44:14.846
Wait up, partner. Hold on.

718
00:44:15.473 --> 00:44:18.767
Wait. I've got to tell you something.
Whoa.

719
00:44:20.603 --> 00:44:22.437
Nice trench.

720
00:44:24.816 --> 00:44:26.900
Hello!

721
00:44:30.571 --> 00:44:33.073
-Let's go.
-No, no. Bad trench. Bad trench.

722
00:44:33.157 --> 00:44:37.119
-We're going to swim over this thing.
-Little red flag going up.

723
00:44:37.203 --> 00:44:40.247
Something's telling me
we should swim through it.

724
00:44:40.331 --> 00:44:43.458
Are you looking at this thing?
It's got death written on it.

725
00:44:43.543 --> 00:44:46.336
I'm sorry, but I think
we should swim through.

726
00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:48.547
I'm done talking about this. Over we go.

727
00:44:48.631 --> 00:44:50.048
Come on. Trust me on this.

728
00:44:50.133 --> 00:44:52.509
-Trust you?
-Yes. Trust. It's what friends do.

729
00:44:53.386 --> 00:44:55.011
-Something shiny!
-Where?

730
00:44:55.096 --> 00:44:58.056
-It just swam over the trench. Come on.
-Okay.

731
00:45:03.187 --> 00:45:06.022
-Boy, it sure is clear up here.
-Exactly.

732
00:45:06.107 --> 00:45:07.315
And look at that.

733
00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.694
There's the current.
We should be there in no time.

734
00:45:11.154 --> 00:45:14.281
-Hey, little guy.
-You wanted to go through the trench.

735
00:45:14.365 --> 00:45:18.785
I shall call him Squishy and
he shall be mine. Come here, Squishy.

736
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:20.912
Come here, little Squishy.

737
00:45:23.875 --> 00:45:27.002
-That's a jellyfish!
-Bad Squishy.

738
00:45:27.086 --> 00:45:28.461
Shoo! Get away.

739
00:45:28.546 --> 00:45:30.422
-Let me see.
-Don't touch it.

740
00:45:30.506 --> 00:45:32.966
I'm not going to touch it.
I just want to look.

741
00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:34.926
How come it didn't sting you?

742
00:45:35.011 --> 00:45:37.470
It did. Hold still.

743
00:45:38.306 --> 00:45:42.809
I live in this anemone and I'm used to
these kind of stings. Come here.

744
00:45:42.894 --> 00:45:44.936
You're going to be fine.

745
00:45:45.021 --> 00:45:48.315
But now we know
that we don't want to touch these again.

746
00:45:48.399 --> 00:45:50.942
Let's be thankful it was just a little one.

747
00:45:54.405 --> 00:45:55.572
Don't move.

748
00:45:57.742 --> 00:45:59.701
This is bad, Dory.

749
00:46:00.494 --> 00:46:03.955
-Boing. Boing.
-Dory!

750
00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.707
You can't catch me.

751
00:46:05.791 --> 00:46:08.418
Don't bounce on the tops. They will

752
00:46:08.502 --> 00:46:10.337
not sting you!

753
00:46:10.421 --> 00:46:13.757
-The tops don't sting you.
-Two in a row. Beat that.

754
00:46:13.841 --> 00:46:15.467
Listen to me. I have an idea.

755
00:46:15.551 --> 00:46:17.344
-A game.
-A game?

756
00:46:17.428 --> 00:46:19.095
I love games. Pick me.

757
00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:23.725
Here's the game. Whoever can hop
the fastest out of these jellyfish wins.

758
00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:25.352
-Okay!
-Rules.

759
00:46:25.436 --> 00:46:27.938
Don't touch the tentacles. Only the tops.

760
00:46:28.022 --> 00:46:31.608
Something about tentacles. Got it.
On your mark. Get set. Go!

761
00:46:32.944 --> 00:46:34.486
Wait!

762
00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:36.613
Go faster if you want to win.

763
00:46:36.697 --> 00:46:39.115
-Dory!
-Boing, boing, boing!

764
00:46:40.076 --> 00:46:42.160
Wait a minute.

765
00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:46.373
So, we're cheating death now.

766
00:46:46.457 --> 00:46:49.042
We're having fun at the same time.

767
00:46:49.126 --> 00:46:50.835
I can do this. Just be careful.

768
00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.587
Careful I don't make you cry when I win.

769
00:46:52.672 --> 00:46:54.130
I don't think so!

770
00:46:57.426 --> 00:47:00.804
Give it up. You can't fight evolution.
I was built for speed.

771
00:47:00.888 --> 00:47:03.348
-The question is, are you hungry?
-Hungry?

772
00:47:03.432 --> 00:47:05.934
Yeah. 'Cause you're about to
eat my bubbles!

773
00:47:06.602 --> 00:47:09.562
Duck to the left, back
and coming over, right there!

774
00:47:11.649 --> 00:47:14.442
The clownfish is the winner!

775
00:47:14.527 --> 00:47:16.987
We did it. Look at us!

776
00:47:17.071 --> 00:47:18.321
Dory?

777
00:47:20.825 --> 00:47:21.825
Oh, no.

778
00:47:23.327 --> 00:47:27.122
Dory! Dory! Dory!

779
00:47:30.001 --> 00:47:31.584
Dory!

780
00:47:37.133 --> 00:47:38.591
Am I disqualified?

781
00:47:38.676 --> 00:47:40.760
You're doing fine. You're winning.

782
00:47:40.845 --> 00:47:43.596
Stay awake.
Where does P. Sherman live?

783
00:47:43.681 --> 00:47:46.850
P. Sherman, Wallaby Way, Sydney.

784
00:47:46.934 --> 00:47:48.393
That's it!

785
00:47:51.772 --> 00:47:54.691
Stay awake. Stay awake. Stay awake.

786
00:47:55.026 --> 00:47:57.986
Stay awake!

787
00:48:01.699 --> 00:48:04.117
-Awake...
-P. Sherman...

788
00:48:04.785 --> 00:48:07.329
-Awake...
-42 Wallaby Way...

789
00:48:08.164 --> 00:48:10.081
-Wake up.
-Sydney.

790
00:48:10.166 --> 00:48:11.207
Nemo...

791
00:48:26.515 --> 00:48:28.767
You miss your dad,
don't you, Sharkbait?

792
00:48:28.851 --> 00:48:29.976
Yeah.

793
00:48:30.061 --> 00:48:33.938
Well, you're lucky to have someone
out there who's looking for you.

794
00:48:34.023 --> 00:48:36.191
He's not looking for me.

795
00:48:36.275 --> 00:48:38.360
He's scared of the ocean.

796
00:48:39.904 --> 00:48:41.237
Peach? Any movement?

797
00:48:41.322 --> 00:48:43.990
He's had four cups of coffee.
It's got to be soon.

798
00:48:44.241 --> 00:48:45.742
Keep on him.

799
00:48:48.412 --> 00:48:51.206
My first escape, landed on dental tools.

800
00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:53.666
-I was aiming for the toilet.
-The toilet?

801
00:48:53.751 --> 00:48:56.628
All drains lead to the ocean, kid.

802
00:48:56.712 --> 00:48:59.714
Wow. How many times
have you tried to get out?

803
00:48:59.799 --> 00:49:04.844
I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be
in a box, kid. It does things to you.

804
00:49:04.929 --> 00:49:07.013
The bubbles, the bubbles!

805
00:49:07.098 --> 00:49:11.184
Potty break! He just grabbed the
Reader's Digest. We have 4.2 minutes.

806
00:49:11.268 --> 00:49:12.852
That's your cue.

807
00:49:12.937 --> 00:49:15.313
-You can do it, kid.
-We got to be quick.

808
00:49:15.398 --> 00:49:19.692
Once you get in, swim to the bottom
and I'll talk you through the rest.

809
00:49:19.777 --> 00:49:20.777
Okay.

810
00:49:20.861 --> 00:49:23.238
Go on. It'll be a piece of kelp.

811
00:49:31.414 --> 00:49:34.040
-Nicely done. Can you hear me?
-Yeah.

812
00:49:34.125 --> 00:49:36.042
Here comes the pebble.

813
00:49:42.216 --> 00:49:45.760
Now, do you see a small opening?

814
00:49:45.845 --> 00:49:48.972
Okay. Inside it you'll see a rotating fan.

815
00:49:49.056 --> 00:49:53.476
Very carefully, wedge that pebble
into the fan to stop it turning.

816
00:49:58.023 --> 00:49:59.399
Careful, Sharkbait.

817
00:49:59.483 --> 00:50:02.152
-I can't do it.
-This isn't a good idea.

818
00:50:02.236 --> 00:50:03.945
He'll be fine. Try again!

819
00:50:04.238 --> 00:50:05.613
Okay.

820
00:50:06.657 --> 00:50:09.367
That's it, Sharkbait.

821
00:50:09.452 --> 00:50:11.703
Nice and steady.

822
00:50:14.248 --> 00:50:17.167
-I got it, I got it!
-He did it.

823
00:50:17.251 --> 00:50:20.462
That's great, kid.
Now swim up the tube and out.

824
00:50:38.022 --> 00:50:40.023
Oh, no! Gill!

825
00:50:40.733 --> 00:50:43.026
Sharkbait! Get him out of there!

826
00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:44.611
-Help him!
-What do we do?

827
00:50:44.695 --> 00:50:47.572
-Oh, no!
-Stay calm, kid. Just don't panic.

828
00:50:49.074 --> 00:50:52.243
-Help me!
-Sharkbait, grab hold of this.

829
00:50:55.956 --> 00:50:56.956
No!

830
00:50:57.041 --> 00:50:58.958
-Feed me more.
-That's it!

831
00:50:59.043 --> 00:51:01.169
Come on, Sharkbait. Grab it.

832
00:51:02.796 --> 00:51:04.756
-I got it.
-Pull!

833
00:51:12.556 --> 00:51:14.891
Gill, don't make him go back in there.

834
00:51:16.393 --> 00:51:19.729
No. We're done.

835
00:51:33.827 --> 00:51:37.956
Dude?

836
00:51:38.749 --> 00:51:40.542
Focus, dude.

837
00:51:41.335 --> 00:51:42.585
Dude?

838
00:51:44.338 --> 00:51:45.880
He lives. Hey, dude.

839
00:51:48.634 --> 00:51:51.594
-What happened?
-I saw the whole thing, dude.

840
00:51:51.679 --> 00:51:55.098
First you were all, like, whoa!
And then we were all, like, whoa!

841
00:51:55.182 --> 00:51:58.393
-Then you were, like, whoa...
-What are you talking about?

842
00:51:58.477 --> 00:52:05.358
You, mini-man! Taking on the jellies.
You got serious thrill issues, dude.

843
00:52:05.442 --> 00:52:06.651
Awesome.

844
00:52:07.111 --> 00:52:08.611
Oh, my stomach.

845
00:52:09.363 --> 00:52:12.490
Man, no hurling on the shell.
I just waxed it.

846
00:52:13.742 --> 00:52:17.036
-So, Mr Turtle...
-Dude, Mr Turtle is my father.

847
00:52:17.121 --> 00:52:18.621
Name's Crush.

848
00:52:18.956 --> 00:52:20.707
Crush? Really?

849
00:52:21.292 --> 00:52:22.542
Okay, Crush.

850
00:52:22.626 --> 00:52:26.004
Listen, I need to get to
the East Australian Current.

851
00:52:26.088 --> 00:52:27.547
EAC?

852
00:52:27.631 --> 00:52:29.173
Dude...

853
00:52:29.258 --> 00:52:31.426
You're riding it, dude.

854
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:33.303
Check it out.

855
00:52:55.284 --> 00:52:56.784
Okay, grab shell, dude.

856
00:52:56.869 --> 00:52:59.078
Grab what?

857
00:53:08.839 --> 00:53:10.590
Righteous! Righteous!

858
00:53:15.596 --> 00:53:17.055
So,

859
00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:21.643
what brings you on this fine day
to the EAC?

860
00:53:21.727 --> 00:53:24.729
Well, Dory and I need to get to Sydney.

861
00:53:24.813 --> 00:53:27.023
Dory! Is she all right?

862
00:53:27.483 --> 00:53:29.651
Oh, little blue.

863
00:53:29.735 --> 00:53:30.902
She is sub-level, dude.

864
00:53:35.157 --> 00:53:37.116
Dory, Dory! Dory!

865
00:53:38.077 --> 00:53:39.285
Oh, Dory.

866
00:53:42.247 --> 00:53:43.873
I'm so sorry.

867
00:53:44.541 --> 00:53:47.418
This is all my fault. It's my fault.

868
00:53:47.503 --> 00:53:50.505
...twenty-nine, 30!
Ready or not, here I come!

869
00:53:53.217 --> 00:53:54.342
There you are.

870
00:53:55.052 --> 00:53:56.552
Catch me if you can.

871
00:54:06.563 --> 00:54:08.356
Up you go!

872
00:54:18.867 --> 00:54:20.159
Oh, my goodness.

873
00:54:20.244 --> 00:54:24.330
Kill the motor, dude.
Let us see what Squirt does flying solo.

874
00:54:33.173 --> 00:54:35.967
Whoa! That was so cool.

875
00:54:36.051 --> 00:54:38.845
Hey, Dad. Did you see that?
Did you see me?

876
00:54:38.929 --> 00:54:43.099
-Did you see what I did?
-You so totally rock, Squirt.

877
00:54:43.183 --> 00:54:44.851
Give me some fin.

878
00:54:44.935 --> 00:54:46.018
Noggin.

879
00:54:46.103 --> 00:54:47.437
Dude.

880
00:54:48.272 --> 00:54:52.942
Intro. Jellyman, Offspring.
Offspring, Jellyman.

881
00:54:53.026 --> 00:54:56.487
-Jellies? Sweet.
-Totally.

882
00:54:56.572 --> 00:54:59.782
I must have done
something you all liked, dudes.

883
00:54:59.867 --> 00:55:01.451
You rock, dude.

884
00:55:02.911 --> 00:55:05.079
Curl away, my son.

885
00:55:05.164 --> 00:55:07.039
It's awesome, Jellyman.

886
00:55:07.124 --> 00:55:10.501
When the little dudes are eggs
we leave them on a beach to hatch,

887
00:55:10.794 --> 00:55:14.547
and coo-coo-cachoo, they find
their way back to the big ol' blue.

888
00:55:14.631 --> 00:55:16.716
-All by themselves?
-Yeah!

889
00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:19.719
But, dude, how do you know
when they're ready?

890
00:55:19.803 --> 00:55:23.973
You never really know, but when
they know, you'll know. You know?

891
00:55:28.854 --> 00:55:31.397
-Hey, look, everybody.
-I know that dude.

892
00:55:31.482 --> 00:55:32.774
It's the Jellyman.

893
00:55:33.484 --> 00:55:36.277
-Well go on. Jump on him.
-Turtle pile!

894
00:55:36.361 --> 00:55:38.070
Wait. Kids!

895
00:55:38.155 --> 00:55:40.031
-You funny?
-Where's your shell?

896
00:55:40.115 --> 00:55:42.408
-Do your stripes come off?
-I need to breathe.

897
00:55:42.493 --> 00:55:44.702
Did you cross the jellyfish forest?

898
00:55:44.787 --> 00:55:47.789
-One at a time.
-Mr Fish, did you die?

899
00:55:47.873 --> 00:55:49.999
Sorry. I was vague on the details.

900
00:55:50.083 --> 00:55:53.586
-So where are you going?
-You see, my son was taken.

901
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:55.922
My son was taken away from me.

902
00:55:56.799 --> 00:55:58.716
-No way!
-What happened?

903
00:55:58.801 --> 00:56:01.761
No, kids. I don't want to talk about it.

904
00:56:01.845 --> 00:56:04.347
-Come on.
-Please.

905
00:56:05.766 --> 00:56:06.766
Well, okay.

906
00:56:07.559 --> 00:56:11.062
I live on this reef, a long way from here.

907
00:56:11.313 --> 00:56:13.397
This is going to be good. I can tell.

908
00:56:13.482 --> 00:56:17.610
My son, Nemo, he was mad at me.

909
00:56:18.362 --> 00:56:21.030
Maybe he wouldn't have done it
if I hadn't been so tough on him.

910
00:56:21.114 --> 00:56:22.448
I don't know.

911
00:56:22.533 --> 00:56:24.951
He swam in the open water to this boat

912
00:56:25.035 --> 00:56:28.496
and these divers appeared
and I tried to stop them.

913
00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:31.457
The boat was too fast,
so we swam out in the ocean...

914
00:56:31.542 --> 00:56:32.708
He couldn't stop them.

915
00:56:32.793 --> 00:56:35.586
Then Nemo's dad,
he swims out to the ocean

916
00:56:35.671 --> 00:56:37.922
and they bump into three sharks.

917
00:56:38.006 --> 00:56:40.424
He scares them away
by blowing them up.

918
00:56:40.509 --> 00:56:43.219
-That's amazing.
-Then dives thousands of feet...

919
00:56:43.303 --> 00:56:47.473
Straight into the dark. It's wicked
dark there. You can't see a thing.

920
00:56:47.558 --> 00:56:50.017
The only thing
they can see down there is...

921
00:56:50.102 --> 00:56:53.813
This big, horrible creature with
razor-sharp teeth! Nice parry.

922
00:56:53.897 --> 00:56:55.398
Then he has to blast his way...

923
00:56:55.482 --> 00:56:58.442
These fish have been
searching the ocean for days

924
00:56:58.527 --> 00:57:00.319
on the East Australian Current.

925
00:57:00.404 --> 00:57:02.446
He may be on his way here right now.

926
00:57:02.531 --> 00:57:04.156
That should put him
in Sydney Harbour...

927
00:57:04.241 --> 00:57:05.616
In a few days.

928
00:57:05.701 --> 00:57:07.660
This guy will stop at nothing...

929
00:57:07.744 --> 00:57:10.538
...stop at nothing until he finds his son.
I hope he makes it.

930
00:57:10.622 --> 00:57:13.457
That's one dedicated father,
if you ask me.

931
00:57:20.090 --> 00:57:22.592
Mine. Mine. Mine.

932
00:57:28.724 --> 00:57:31.434
Would you just shut up?

933
00:57:31.518 --> 00:57:35.313
-You're rats with wings.
-This bloke's looking for his boy, Nemo.

934
00:57:35.397 --> 00:57:39.066
-He was taken off the reef by divers...
-There. Take it.

935
00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:42.695
Say that again.
You said something about Nemo.

936
00:57:42.779 --> 00:57:44.488
Mine. Mine. Mine.

937
00:57:47.284 --> 00:57:48.284
Mine.

938
00:57:48.368 --> 00:57:51.537
Last I heard,
he's heading towards the harbour.

939
00:57:51.622 --> 00:57:52.955
Brilliant!

940
00:58:06.762 --> 00:58:08.137
Is he doing okay?

941
00:58:08.221 --> 00:58:11.474
I don't know, but whatever you do,
don't mention D-A-R...

942
00:58:11.558 --> 00:58:14.602
It's okay.
I know who you're talking about.

943
00:58:22.903 --> 00:58:27.615
Gill?

944
00:58:29.117 --> 00:58:30.326
Hey, Sharkbait.

945
00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:34.789
-I'm sorry I couldn't stop...
-I'm the one who should be sorry.

946
00:58:36.083 --> 00:58:40.294
I was so ready to get out,
so ready to taste that ocean,

947
00:58:40.921 --> 00:58:43.673
I was willing to put you
in harm's way to get there.

948
00:58:44.967 --> 00:58:47.176
Nothing should be worth that.

949
00:58:48.679 --> 00:58:51.013
I'm sorry I couldn't get you
back to your father, kid.

950
00:58:55.310 --> 00:58:57.311
All right. Hey, hey, hey!

951
00:58:58.063 --> 00:58:59.522
What the...

952
00:58:59.606 --> 00:59:02.191
Well, that's one way to pull a tooth.

953
00:59:04.695 --> 00:59:08.698
Darn kids. Well, good thing
I pulled the right one, eh?

954
00:59:10.117 --> 00:59:12.243
Nigel, you just missed an extraction.

955
00:59:12.327 --> 00:59:15.037
Has he loosened
the periodontal ligament yet?

956
00:59:15.122 --> 00:59:17.289
What am I talking about?
Where's Nemo?

957
00:59:17.374 --> 00:59:19.000
I've got to speak with him.

958
00:59:19.084 --> 00:59:22.128
Your dad's been fighting the ocean
looking for you.

959
00:59:22.212 --> 00:59:24.213
My father? Really?

960
00:59:24.297 --> 00:59:26.132
He's travelled hundreds of miles.

961
00:59:26.216 --> 00:59:29.427
-He's been battling sharks and jellyfish.
-Sharks?

962
00:59:29.511 --> 00:59:32.430
-That can't be him.
-Are you sure? What was his name?

963
00:59:32.514 --> 00:59:34.515
Some sort of sport fish. Tuna? Trout?

964
00:59:34.599 --> 00:59:36.183
-Marlin?
-That's it.

965
00:59:36.268 --> 00:59:39.854
-The clownfish from the reef.
-It's my dad! He took on a shark!

966
00:59:39.938 --> 00:59:42.940
-I heard he took on three.
-Three?

967
00:59:43.025 --> 00:59:45.317
-Three sharks?
-That's 4,800 teeth!

968
00:59:45.402 --> 00:59:47.570
After you were taken by Diver Dan,

969
00:59:47.654 --> 00:59:49.655
your dad followed the boat
like a maniac.

970
00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:50.906
Really?

971
00:59:50.991 --> 00:59:54.577
He's giving it all he's got
and then three sharks capture him.

972
00:59:54.661 --> 00:59:57.455
He blows 'em up
and then dives thousands of feet

973
00:59:57.539 --> 00:59:59.999
and gets chased
by a monster with huge teeth!

974
01:00:00.083 --> 01:00:02.626
He ties this demon to a rock.
And his reward?

975
01:00:02.711 --> 01:00:05.087
He gets to battle a jellyfish forest.

976
01:00:05.172 --> 01:00:08.299
Now he's with sea turtles
on the East Australian Current

977
01:00:08.383 --> 01:00:11.844
and the word is he's headed this way,
right now, to Sydney!

978
01:00:12.345 --> 01:00:15.931
-What a good daddy.
-He was looking for you after all.

979
01:00:19.728 --> 01:00:22.521
-He's swimming in the filter!
-Not again!

980
01:00:24.775 --> 01:00:25.775
Sharkbait!

981
01:00:27.861 --> 01:00:30.112
-No!
-You've got your life ahead of you.

982
01:00:30.197 --> 01:00:32.114
-We'll help you.
-Get him out.

983
01:00:37.829 --> 01:00:40.456
-Get him out of there.
-Come on. Grab the end.

984
01:00:41.917 --> 01:00:43.459
Are you okay?

985
01:00:43.543 --> 01:00:46.545
Can you hear me, Sharkbait?
Nemo? Can you hear me?

986
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:48.089
Yeah, I can hear you.

987
01:00:48.757 --> 01:00:50.800
Sharkbait, you did it!

988
01:00:50.884 --> 01:00:53.803
Sharkbait, you're...
Covered with germs!

989
01:00:54.304 --> 01:00:55.763
That took guts.

990
01:00:56.515 --> 01:01:00.017
All right, we have less than
48 hours before Darla gets here.

991
01:01:00.102 --> 01:01:02.144
This tank will get plenty dirty
in that time,

992
01:01:02.229 --> 01:01:04.396
but we have to help it along.

993
01:01:04.481 --> 01:01:06.941
-Jacques, no cleaning.
-I shall resist.

994
01:01:07.025 --> 01:01:09.735
Everybody else,
be as gross as possible.

995
01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:11.278
Think dirty thoughts.

996
01:01:11.363 --> 01:01:14.949
We're going to make this tank so filthy,
the dentist'll have to clean it.

997
01:01:15.492 --> 01:01:16.867
Good work.

998
01:01:24.709 --> 01:01:27.253
All right, we're here, dudes.

999
01:01:27.337 --> 01:01:30.131
Get ready! Your exit's coming up, man.

1000
01:01:30.215 --> 01:01:33.801
-Where? I don't see it.
-Right there. I see it. I see it.

1001
01:01:34.845 --> 01:01:38.639
-You mean the swirling vortex of terror?
-That's it, dude.

1002
01:01:38.723 --> 01:01:42.601
-Of course it is.
-First, find your exit buddy.

1003
01:01:43.728 --> 01:01:46.856
-Do you have your exit buddy?
-Yes.

1004
01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:52.403
Squirt here will now give you a rundown
on proper exiting technique.

1005
01:01:52.487 --> 01:01:55.573
Good afternoon. We're going to have
a great jump today.

1006
01:01:56.616 --> 01:01:59.785
Crank a hard cutback
as you hit the wall.

1007
01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:02.788
There's a screaming bottom turn,
so watch out.

1008
01:02:02.873 --> 01:02:05.624
Remember, rip it, roll it and punch it!

1009
01:02:06.835 --> 01:02:09.295
It's like he's trying to speak to me,
I know it.

1010
01:02:09.379 --> 01:02:14.091
You're really cute, but I don't know what
you're saying. Say the first thing again.

1011
01:02:14.176 --> 01:02:17.136
Okay, Jellyman. Go, go, go!

1012
01:02:24.853 --> 01:02:26.729
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

1013
01:02:31.151 --> 01:02:33.068
That was fun.

1014
01:02:33.612 --> 01:02:35.362
I actually enjoyed that.

1015
01:02:35.447 --> 01:02:36.906
Hey, look! Turtles.

1016
01:02:38.366 --> 01:02:39.825
Most excellent.

1017
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:45.456
Now, turn your fishy tails round and
swim straight on through to Sydney.

1018
01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:47.124
No worries, man.

1019
01:02:47.209 --> 01:02:49.752
No worries. Thank you, Dude Crush.

1020
01:02:49.836 --> 01:02:52.046
-Bye.
-See you, Jellyman.

1021
01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:54.465
Tell your little dude I said hi, okay?

1022
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:57.092
-See ya later, dudes.
-Bye, everyone.

1023
01:02:57.636 --> 01:02:59.762
Nemo would have loved this.

1024
01:03:00.597 --> 01:03:04.475
Hey, Crush. I forgot. How old are you?

1025
01:03:04.559 --> 01:03:06.560
150, dude!

1026
01:03:06.645 --> 01:03:09.355
And still young. Rock on!

1027
01:03:09.439 --> 01:03:12.733
150. I got to remember that.

1028
01:03:13.652 --> 01:03:15.110
Whoa.

1029
01:03:19.449 --> 01:03:21.992
-We going in there?
-Yep.

1030
01:03:22.077 --> 01:03:23.953
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

1031
01:03:24.037 --> 01:03:25.079
Yep.

1032
01:03:25.956 --> 01:03:28.624
We're going to just swim straight.

1033
01:03:29.918 --> 01:03:32.002
Just keep swimming

1034
01:03:32.087 --> 01:03:33.504
Dory...

1035
01:03:42.806 --> 01:03:45.349
Boy, this is taking a while.

1036
01:03:45.433 --> 01:03:47.977
-Hey, how about we play a game?
-Okay.

1037
01:03:48.061 --> 01:03:51.397
Okay, I'm thinking of something orange.

1038
01:03:51.481 --> 01:03:53.274
-And it's small...
-It's me.

1039
01:03:53.358 --> 01:03:54.400
Right.

1040
01:03:54.484 --> 01:03:58.862
This one you'll never guess.
It's orange and small.

1041
01:03:58.947 --> 01:03:59.947
It's me.

1042
01:04:00.031 --> 01:04:01.907
All righty, Mr Smarty Pants.

1043
01:04:01.992 --> 01:04:05.244
It's orange and small
and white stripes...

1044
01:04:05.328 --> 01:04:07.454
Me. And the next one, just a guess, me.

1045
01:04:07.539 --> 01:04:08.747
Okay. That's just scary.

1046
01:04:08.832 --> 01:04:11.917
Wait. I've seen
this floating speck before.

1047
01:04:12.002 --> 01:04:14.586
That means we've passed it.

1048
01:04:14.671 --> 01:04:16.964
That means we're not going straight.

1049
01:04:17.048 --> 01:04:20.009
We got to get to the surface.
We'll figure it out there.

1050
01:04:20.093 --> 01:04:21.260
-Hey!
-What?

1051
01:04:21.344 --> 01:04:23.637
Relax. Take a deep breath.

1052
01:04:27.267 --> 01:04:29.768
Now, let's ask somebody for directions.

1053
01:04:29.853 --> 01:04:32.313
Fine. Who? The speck?
There's nobody here!

1054
01:04:32.397 --> 01:04:34.857
There has to be someone.
It's the ocean.

1055
01:04:34.941 --> 01:04:37.609
We're not the only two in here.
Let's see...

1056
01:04:37.694 --> 01:04:39.486
Okay, no one there.

1057
01:04:39.571 --> 01:04:41.071
Nope.

1058
01:04:44.743 --> 01:04:47.578
-There's somebody. Hey, excu...
-Dory!

1059
01:04:47.662 --> 01:04:50.122
I'm thinking of something mysterious.

1060
01:04:50.206 --> 01:04:54.376
It's a fish we don't know, and if we
ask it directions, it could ingest us.

1061
01:04:54.461 --> 01:04:56.962
What is it with men
and asking for directions?

1062
01:04:57.047 --> 01:05:00.632
Don't play the gender card.
Let's play the "let's not die" card.

1063
01:05:00.717 --> 01:05:02.676
-Want to get out of here?
-Of course.

1064
01:05:02.761 --> 01:05:06.805
How are we going to do that unless
we give it a shot and hope for the best?

1065
01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:09.975
-You don't fully understand.
-Trust me on this.

1066
01:05:19.194 --> 01:05:20.402
All right.

1067
01:05:22.614 --> 01:05:25.199
Excuse me? Little fella?

1068
01:05:26.576 --> 01:05:27.618
Hello.

1069
01:05:27.702 --> 01:05:29.536
Don't be rude. Say hi.

1070
01:05:29.621 --> 01:05:31.246
Hello.

1071
01:05:31.331 --> 01:05:33.665
-His son Bingo...
-Nemo.

1072
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:36.001
-...was taken to...
-Sydney.

1073
01:05:36.086 --> 01:05:37.419
Sydney, yes.

1074
01:05:37.504 --> 01:05:41.298
It's really important
that we get there as fast as we can.

1075
01:05:41.383 --> 01:05:43.133
Can you help us out?

1076
01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:46.762
Come on, little fella. Come on.

1077
01:05:48.181 --> 01:05:50.015
Dory, I'm a little fella.

1078
01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:53.394
I don't think that's a little fella.

1079
01:05:55.897 --> 01:05:58.232
Big fella. Whale. Okay.

1080
01:05:58.316 --> 01:06:00.442
Maybe he only speaks whale.

1081
01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:04.363
We need

1082
01:06:04.447 --> 01:06:07.658
to find his son.

1083
01:06:07.742 --> 01:06:10.536
What are you doing?
Are you sure you speak whale?

1084
01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:13.580
Can you give us...

1085
01:06:13.665 --> 01:06:16.708
-Heaven knows what you're saying.
-...directions?

1086
01:06:16.793 --> 01:06:20.129
-See, he's swimming away.
-Come back.

1087
01:06:20.213 --> 01:06:21.839
You've offended him.

1088
01:06:21.923 --> 01:06:23.465
Maybe a different dialect.

1089
01:06:26.803 --> 01:06:29.972
This is not whale.
You're speaking, like, upset stomach.

1090
01:06:30.056 --> 01:06:32.766
-Maybe I should try humpback.
-No, don't.

1091
01:06:34.394 --> 01:06:36.979
-You sound sick.
-Maybe louder, huh?

1092
01:06:37.063 --> 01:06:38.981
-Don't do that.
-Too much orca.

1093
01:06:39.065 --> 01:06:43.861
-Didn't that sound a little orca-ish?
-It sounds like nothing I've ever heard.

1094
01:06:46.281 --> 01:06:47.990
Just as well. He might be hungry.

1095
01:06:48.074 --> 01:06:51.076
Whales don't eat clownfish.
They eat krill.

1096
01:06:51.161 --> 01:06:53.787
-Swim away!
-Look. Krill!

1097
01:06:56.708 --> 01:06:59.334
Move, Dory! Move!

1098
01:07:05.508 --> 01:07:08.552
Look at that. Would you look at that?

1099
01:07:08.636 --> 01:07:11.930
Filthy. Absolutely filthy.

1100
01:07:12.015 --> 01:07:15.434
And it's all thanks to you, kid.
You made it possible.

1101
01:07:15.518 --> 01:07:17.436
Jacques, I said no cleaning.

1102
01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:18.604
I am ashamed.

1103
01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:21.148
Look. Scum angel.

1104
01:07:26.196 --> 01:07:28.030
Bubbles! I love the bubbles.

1105
01:07:29.491 --> 01:07:33.494
Flo? Has anybody seen Flo? Flo!

1106
01:07:33.578 --> 01:07:35.704
9:00, and cue dentist.

1107
01:07:36.664 --> 01:07:38.373
Barbara. Sorry I'm late.

1108
01:07:38.458 --> 01:07:40.667
Okay. Here we go.

1109
01:07:40.752 --> 01:07:42.419
Little Davey Reynolds.

1110
01:07:42.504 --> 01:07:46.757
-Walks to the counter, drops the keys...
-Bloat, that's disgusting.

1111
01:07:47.217 --> 01:07:49.176
Tastes pretty good to me.

1112
01:07:50.428 --> 01:07:53.055
Don't you realise
we are swimming in our own...

1113
01:07:53.556 --> 01:07:55.641
-Here he comes.
-What the...

1114
01:07:57.227 --> 01:07:59.019
Crikey. What a state.

1115
01:08:02.982 --> 01:08:06.151
Barbara, what's my earliest
appointment tomorrow?

1116
01:08:06.236 --> 01:08:08.111
-10:00, love.
-Leave it open.

1117
01:08:08.196 --> 01:08:11.698
I've got to clean the fish tank
before Darla gets here.

1118
01:08:11.783 --> 01:08:16.662
-You hear that, Sharkbait?
-Yay! He's going to clean the tank!

1119
01:08:16.746 --> 01:08:18.622
Yeah, we're going to be clean!

1120
01:08:18.706 --> 01:08:20.624
Ready to see your dad?

1121
01:08:20.708 --> 01:08:21.833
Course you are.

1122
01:08:22.293 --> 01:08:27.756
I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there
in the harbour waiting for you right now.

1123
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:29.925
Yeah.

1124
01:09:45.627 --> 01:09:49.588
Here comes a big one!
Come on. You got to try this.

1125
01:09:49.672 --> 01:09:53.258
-Will you just stop it?
-Why? What's wrong?

1126
01:09:53.343 --> 01:09:56.136
-We're in a whale. Don't you get it?
-A whale?

1127
01:09:56.220 --> 01:10:00.182
A whale! 'Cause you had to ask for help.
And now we're stuck here.

1128
01:10:00.266 --> 01:10:04.519
-A whale? You know, I speak whale.
-You're insane. You can't speak whale.

1129
01:10:04.604 --> 01:10:07.439
I have to get out. I have to find my son.

1130
01:10:08.441 --> 01:10:13.195
I have to tell him
how old sea turtles are!

1131
01:10:24.207 --> 01:10:25.207
Hey.

1132
01:10:27.585 --> 01:10:29.127
You okay?

1133
01:10:35.843 --> 01:10:37.427
There, there.

1134
01:10:37.512 --> 01:10:40.138
It's all right. It'll be okay.

1135
01:10:40.223 --> 01:10:42.683
No. It won't.

1136
01:10:42.767 --> 01:10:45.060
Sure it will. You'll see.

1137
01:10:45.144 --> 01:10:49.731
No. I promised him I'd never
let anything happen to him.

1138
01:10:52.735 --> 01:10:55.070
That's a funny thing to promise.

1139
01:10:55.154 --> 01:10:56.154
What?

1140
01:10:56.239 --> 01:10:58.740
You can't never let anything
happen to him.

1141
01:10:58.825 --> 01:11:01.410
Then nothing would
ever happen to him.

1142
01:11:04.038 --> 01:11:06.248
Not much fun for little Harpo.

1143
01:11:16.676 --> 01:11:19.386
-What's going on?
-Don't know. I'll ask him.

1144
01:11:22.265 --> 01:11:24.850
-What's...
-Dory.

1145
01:11:26.477 --> 01:11:28.603
on?

1146
01:11:34.318 --> 01:11:37.487
-I think he says we've stopped.
-Of course we've stopped.

1147
01:11:37.572 --> 01:11:41.283
Stop trying to speak whale.
You're going to make things worse.

1148
01:11:41.367 --> 01:11:43.118
What is that noise?

1149
01:11:46.789 --> 01:11:48.665
Oh, no. Look what you did.

1150
01:11:50.126 --> 01:11:53.628
The water's going down.
It's going down!

1151
01:11:57.633 --> 01:12:00.886
-Really? You sure about that?
-Look. Already it's half-empty.

1152
01:12:01.971 --> 01:12:05.015
-I'd say it's half-full.
-Stop that. It's half-empty!

1153
01:12:08.269 --> 01:12:10.812
Okay, that one was a little tougher.

1154
01:12:10.897 --> 01:12:13.815
He either said we should go
to the back of the throat

1155
01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:16.067
or he wants a root beer float.

1156
01:12:16.152 --> 01:12:19.863
Of course he wants us to go there.
That's eating us!

1157
01:12:19.947 --> 01:12:22.657
How do I taste, Moby? Do I taste good?

1158
01:12:22.742 --> 01:12:24.826
Tell him
I'm not interested in being lunch.

1159
01:12:24.911 --> 01:12:27.329
-Okay. He's...
-Stop talking to him.

1160
01:12:33.753 --> 01:12:36.797
-What is going on?
-I'll check. What...

1161
01:12:36.881 --> 01:12:39.508
No. No more whale.
You can't speak whale.

1162
01:12:39.592 --> 01:12:41.176
Yes, I can.

1163
01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:42.260
No, you can't.

1164
01:12:42.345 --> 01:12:45.847
You think you can do these things,
but you can't, Nemo.

1165
01:12:50.686 --> 01:12:52.687
-Okay.
-Dory!

1166
01:12:56.275 --> 01:12:59.528
He says it's time to let go.

1167
01:12:59.612 --> 01:13:01.905
Everything's going to be all right.

1168
01:13:01.989 --> 01:13:03.949
How do you know?

1169
01:13:04.033 --> 01:13:06.368
How do you know something bad
isn't going to happen?

1170
01:13:07.078 --> 01:13:08.286
I don't!

1171
01:13:31.686 --> 01:13:33.645
We're alive!

1172
01:13:35.398 --> 01:13:37.440
Look. Syd-ney.

1173
01:13:37.525 --> 01:13:39.484
Sydney! Sydney.

1174
01:13:39.569 --> 01:13:41.069
Sydney again.

1175
01:13:42.196 --> 01:13:44.406
You were right. We made it!

1176
01:13:45.074 --> 01:13:47.158
We're going to find my son.

1177
01:13:50.329 --> 01:13:54.249
Thank you, sir.

1178
01:13:54.333 --> 01:13:56.376
Wow. I wish I could speak whale.

1179
01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:58.670
Now we find the boat that took him.

1180
01:13:58.754 --> 01:14:01.548
-Right.
-Come on. We can do this!

1181
01:14:16.981 --> 01:14:19.858
Morning. It's morning, everyone.

1182
01:14:19.942 --> 01:14:24.613
Today's the day. The sun is shining, the
tank is clean and we are getting out of...

1183
01:14:25.114 --> 01:14:26.239
The tank is clean.

1184
01:14:26.949 --> 01:14:28.658
The tank is clean!

1185
01:14:29.785 --> 01:14:30.952
But how?

1186
01:14:31.037 --> 01:14:33.997
Boss must have installed it
while we were sleeping.

1187
01:14:34.081 --> 01:14:36.583
-What are we going to do?
-What's it say, Peach?

1188
01:14:38.002 --> 01:14:39.711
I can't hear you, Peach.

1189
01:14:39.795 --> 01:14:44.132
The Aqua Scum 2003 is an all-purpose,
self-cleaning salt-water purifier

1190
01:14:44.216 --> 01:14:46.801
that extends
the life of your aquarium fish.

1191
01:14:46.886 --> 01:14:47.969
Stop it!

1192
01:14:48.054 --> 01:14:51.932
The Aqua Scum is programmed
to scan your tank every five minutes?

1193
01:14:52.016 --> 01:14:53.725
Scan? What does that mean?

1194
01:14:59.065 --> 01:15:01.816
Temperature 82 degrees,
pH balance normal.

1195
01:15:03.277 --> 01:15:04.319
Nice.

1196
01:15:05.863 --> 01:15:09.074
Curse you, Aqua Scum!

1197
01:15:09.158 --> 01:15:12.494
-That's it for the escape plan.
-Then what are we going to do about...

1198
01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:14.454
Darla!

1199
01:15:14.538 --> 01:15:16.331
Stay down, kid.

1200
01:15:18.668 --> 01:15:21.252
-False alarm.
-My nerves can't take much more.

1201
01:15:21.504 --> 01:15:24.089
What are we going to do
when that brat gets here?

1202
01:15:24.173 --> 01:15:26.841
-I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
-Help!

1203
01:15:26.926 --> 01:15:28.843
-Help me!
-Hold on. I'm coming.

1204
01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:30.011
Help me!

1205
01:15:30.096 --> 01:15:32.931
Swim down! Come on, kid. Swim down!

1206
01:15:33.015 --> 01:15:35.392
-Everybody jump in.
-Swim down!

1207
01:15:35.476 --> 01:15:36.935
What the...

1208
01:15:37.937 --> 01:15:39.020
Good work.

1209
01:15:39.563 --> 01:15:41.856
-Gill!
-Sharkbait!

1210
01:15:43.401 --> 01:15:46.528
-Roll, kid! Lean, kid! Roll!
-Go to the window.

1211
01:15:51.075 --> 01:15:53.410
That would have been a nasty fall.

1212
01:15:53.494 --> 01:15:56.454
-I don't want to go belly-up!
-Calm down, Nemo.

1213
01:15:56.539 --> 01:15:58.790
You won't go belly-up. I promise.

1214
01:15:58.874 --> 01:15:59.874
You're going to be okay.

1215
01:16:04.046 --> 01:16:05.130
Darla!

1216
01:16:10.136 --> 01:16:12.762
Do any of these boats
look familiar to you?

1217
01:16:12.847 --> 01:16:15.056
No, but the boat has to be here.

1218
01:16:15.141 --> 01:16:18.184
-We're going to find it.
-I'm totally excited.

1219
01:16:18.269 --> 01:16:20.812
-Are you excited?
-Dory, wake up. Come on.

1220
01:16:21.814 --> 01:16:22.856
Duck!

1221
01:16:23.983 --> 01:16:26.526
That's not a duck. It's a pelican!

1222
01:16:35.911 --> 01:16:38.747
No! I didn't come this far
to be breakfast.

1223
01:16:46.839 --> 01:16:49.257
Hey, Nigel. Would you look at that?

1224
01:16:49.341 --> 01:16:50.341
What?

1225
01:16:50.426 --> 01:16:53.720
Sun's barely up and Gerald's
had more than he can handle.

1226
01:16:53.804 --> 01:16:56.973
Yeah. Reckon somebody
ought to help the poor guy.

1227
01:16:58.768 --> 01:17:01.561
Well, don't everybody fly off at once!

1228
01:17:04.732 --> 01:17:06.733
All right, Gerald. What is it?

1229
01:17:06.817 --> 01:17:08.610
Fish got your tongue?

1230
01:17:09.111 --> 01:17:10.570
Love a duck!

1231
01:17:10.946 --> 01:17:12.322
I've got to find my son Nemo.

1232
01:17:13.032 --> 01:17:14.074
Nemo?

1233
01:17:14.158 --> 01:17:18.078
He's that fish that's been
fighting the whole ocean.

1234
01:17:18.162 --> 01:17:20.497
Hey, I know where your son...

1235
01:17:21.791 --> 01:17:23.875
Wait. Come back.

1236
01:17:23.959 --> 01:17:26.461
-Stop!
-Keep going. He's crazy.

1237
01:17:26.545 --> 01:17:28.838
I've got something to tell you.

1238
01:17:32.802 --> 01:17:33.843
Mine.

1239
01:17:38.432 --> 01:17:42.143
Okay. Don't make any sudden moves.

1240
01:17:42.228 --> 01:17:45.772
Hop inside my mouth if you want to live.

1241
01:17:45.856 --> 01:17:49.984
Hop into your mouth?
And how does that make me live?

1242
01:17:50.069 --> 01:17:54.239
-Mine?
-Because I can take you to your son.

1243
01:17:54.323 --> 01:17:55.657
Yeah, right!

1244
01:17:55.741 --> 01:18:00.120
No. I know your son. He's orange.
He's got a gimpy fin on one side.

1245
01:18:00.204 --> 01:18:02.497
-That's Nemo!
-Mine! Mine! Mine!

1246
01:18:05.334 --> 01:18:07.585
Fasten your seat belts!

1247
01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:10.880
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1248
01:18:29.567 --> 01:18:31.526
Everybody hold on!

1249
01:18:35.197 --> 01:18:37.407
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1250
01:18:44.290 --> 01:18:46.124
Too loud. Too loud for me.

1251
01:18:46.208 --> 01:18:48.418
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

1252
01:18:48.502 --> 01:18:51.254
Find a happy place.
Find a happy place!

1253
01:18:52.006 --> 01:18:54.549
Darla, your uncle will see you now.

1254
01:18:56.385 --> 01:18:59.220
All right. Let's see those pearly whites.

1255
01:18:59.763 --> 01:19:01.306
I'm a piranha.

1256
01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:02.974
They're in the Amazon.

1257
01:19:03.058 --> 01:19:06.561
And a piranha's a fish.
Just like your present.

1258
01:19:08.397 --> 01:19:09.981
-I got a fishy!
-Oh, no.

1259
01:19:11.233 --> 01:19:12.525
Poor little guy.

1260
01:19:12.610 --> 01:19:14.444
-He's dead.
-Sharkbait!

1261
01:19:14.528 --> 01:19:16.196
Yay! Fishy, fishy, fishy!

1262
01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:20.116
Must have left your present
in the car, sweetie. I'll go and get it.

1263
01:19:20.201 --> 01:19:21.701
He's still alive!

1264
01:19:21.785 --> 01:19:23.453
Why is he playing dead?

1265
01:19:23.537 --> 01:19:25.288
He's going to
get flushed down the toilet.

1266
01:19:25.372 --> 01:19:27.832
He's going to get out of here.

1267
01:19:27.917 --> 01:19:31.836
-What a smart little guy.
-No, not the trash can!

1268
01:19:33.088 --> 01:19:35.131
Hey! I found his dad.

1269
01:19:35.216 --> 01:19:36.799
-Where's Nemo?
-Dentist!

1270
01:19:36.884 --> 01:19:38.593
-He's over there.
-What's a dentist?

1271
01:19:39.887 --> 01:19:42.263
-Get in there.
-I can't go in there.

1272
01:19:42.348 --> 01:19:45.767
Oh, yes you can. Charge!

1273
01:19:47.186 --> 01:19:48.603
What the...

1274
01:19:50.606 --> 01:19:52.565
Darla, sweetie, look out.

1275
01:19:56.195 --> 01:19:59.197
Hold still. Easy, easy.

1276
01:20:00.741 --> 01:20:02.075
Hold still!

1277
01:20:02.159 --> 01:20:03.952
It's all right. Nobody's going to hurt you.

1278
01:20:12.336 --> 01:20:14.045
Nemo.

1279
01:20:14.129 --> 01:20:16.130
-Oh, my goodness.
-Gotcha!

1280
01:20:17.508 --> 01:20:19.676
-Nemo!
-Daddy?

1281
01:20:20.511 --> 01:20:23.137
Out with you. And stay out!

1282
01:20:23.806 --> 01:20:26.474
-Daddy?
-Fishy?

1283
01:20:27.309 --> 01:20:28.393
Fishy!

1284
01:20:28.477 --> 01:20:30.186
Wake up! Wake up!

1285
01:20:30.271 --> 01:20:31.729
-Oh, no!
-To the top

1286
01:20:31.814 --> 01:20:33.398
of Mount Wannahockaloogie.

1287
01:20:33.482 --> 01:20:35.775
Why are you sleeping?

1288
01:20:36.026 --> 01:20:38.236
-Hurry!
-Bloat!

1289
01:20:41.448 --> 01:20:43.324
Ring of Fire!

1290
01:20:45.327 --> 01:20:46.661
Fishy!

1291
01:20:48.914 --> 01:20:50.581
-Get it out!
-Crikey!

1292
01:20:50.666 --> 01:20:52.333
The animals have gone mad!

1293
01:20:54.712 --> 01:20:56.421
Get it out!

1294
01:20:56.505 --> 01:20:58.464
-Smack her in the head!
-Go, Gill, go!

1295
01:20:58.549 --> 01:21:00.508
There's a fish in my hair!

1296
01:21:01.343 --> 01:21:03.344
-Gill.
-Sharkbait.

1297
01:21:03.429 --> 01:21:06.306
Tell your dad I said hi.

1298
01:21:11.687 --> 01:21:13.104
Go get him.

1299
01:21:18.027 --> 01:21:19.485
He did it!

1300
01:21:20.362 --> 01:21:22.447
-I'm happy.
-Is he going to be okay?

1301
01:21:22.531 --> 01:21:25.325
Don't worry.
All drains lead to the ocean.

1302
01:21:25.409 --> 01:21:26.868
Fishy!

1303
01:21:34.835 --> 01:21:36.377
Daddy!

1304
01:22:12.748 --> 01:22:14.791
I'm... I'm so sorry.

1305
01:22:16.502 --> 01:22:18.044
Truly I am.

1306
01:22:36.188 --> 01:22:37.688
-Hey...
-Dory.

1307
01:22:38.941 --> 01:22:42.777
If it wasn't for you,
I never would have even made it here.

1308
01:22:43.695 --> 01:22:45.154
So thank you.

1309
01:22:47.366 --> 01:22:48.866
Hey, wait a minute.

1310
01:22:49.284 --> 01:22:51.702
Wait. Where are you going?

1311
01:22:51.787 --> 01:22:54.664
It's over, Dory. We were too late.

1312
01:22:56.291 --> 01:22:58.167
Nemo's gone.

1313
01:22:58.252 --> 01:23:00.169
I'm going home now.

1314
01:23:00.254 --> 01:23:02.338
No. No, you can't.

1315
01:23:04.299 --> 01:23:05.466
Stop!

1316
01:23:08.429 --> 01:23:10.680
Please don't go away. Please?

1317
01:23:12.099 --> 01:23:14.142
No one's ever stuck with me
for so long before.

1318
01:23:14.810 --> 01:23:17.061
And if you leave...

1319
01:23:17.855 --> 01:23:20.648
I remember things better with you.
Look.

1320
01:23:20.732 --> 01:23:22.984
P. Sherman, 42...

1321
01:23:24.027 --> 01:23:25.736
42...

1322
01:23:26.905 --> 01:23:29.449
I remember it. It's there. I know it is.

1323
01:23:29.533 --> 01:23:32.118
Because when I look at you, I can feel it.

1324
01:23:32.202 --> 01:23:34.537
And I look at you and I...

1325
01:23:36.165 --> 01:23:37.623
I'm home.

1326
01:23:40.294 --> 01:23:43.504
Please. I don't want that to go away.

1327
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:46.507
I don't want to forget.

1328
01:23:48.051 --> 01:23:50.094
I'm sorry, Dory,

1329
01:23:50.179 --> 01:23:51.679
but I do.

1330
01:24:03.567 --> 01:24:06.903
-Manna from heaven.
-Sweet nectar of life.

1331
01:24:07.529 --> 01:24:09.155
Hey!

1332
01:24:09.239 --> 01:24:12.200
-This is our spot.
-Go on. Get out of here.

1333
01:24:13.452 --> 01:24:16.037
Hey, hey, hey.

1334
01:24:16.121 --> 01:24:17.788
Yeah, that's it.

1335
01:24:18.957 --> 01:24:20.708
Too right, mate!

1336
01:24:20.792 --> 01:24:22.418
I got a live one here!

1337
01:24:22.503 --> 01:24:24.962
-Have you seen my dad?
-Gotcha!

1338
01:24:25.047 --> 01:24:27.632
-Come back here.
-You let him go!

1339
01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:36.057
Dad!

1340
01:24:36.141 --> 01:24:37.475
No!

1341
01:24:50.405 --> 01:24:52.532
-Excuse me.
-No.

1342
01:24:52.616 --> 01:24:55.034
-Are you all right?
-I don't know where I am.

1343
01:24:55.118 --> 01:24:57.537
I don't know what's going on.
I think I lost somebody,

1344
01:24:57.621 --> 01:24:59.330
but I can't remember.

1345
01:24:59.414 --> 01:25:01.832
-It's okay.
-I can't remember.

1346
01:25:01.917 --> 01:25:05.545
I'm looking for someone, too.
We can look together.

1347
01:25:07.089 --> 01:25:09.048
-I'm Dory.
-I'm Nemo.

1348
01:25:09.132 --> 01:25:10.591
Nemo?

1349
01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:12.510
That's a nice name.

1350
01:25:21.812 --> 01:25:23.646
-Dad!
-Dad!

1351
01:25:23.730 --> 01:25:25.314
-Dad.
-Dad.

1352
01:25:25.399 --> 01:25:26.983
Wait a minute. Is it your dad or my dad?

1353
01:25:27.067 --> 01:25:28.192
My dad.

1354
01:25:28.277 --> 01:25:30.194
-Got it. Dad!
-Where are we anyway?

1355
01:25:30.279 --> 01:25:31.487
Dad!

1356
01:25:32.322 --> 01:25:34.657
Syl... Schai...

1357
01:25:34.741 --> 01:25:36.158
Sydney.

1358
01:25:36.243 --> 01:25:38.828
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

1359
01:25:40.622 --> 01:25:42.039
-Nemo!
-What?

1360
01:25:42.124 --> 01:25:43.749
It's you! Nemo!

1361
01:25:43.834 --> 01:25:45.459
Yes. I'm Nemo.

1362
01:25:45.544 --> 01:25:48.296
You're Nemo.
You were dead. I saw you.

1363
01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:50.715
And then... Here you are.
You're not dead.

1364
01:25:50.799 --> 01:25:53.217
And your father... Your father!

1365
01:25:53.302 --> 01:25:56.220
My father? You know my father?
Where is he?

1366
01:25:56.305 --> 01:25:58.055
He went this way. Quick!

1367
01:25:59.683 --> 01:26:00.725
Hey!

1368
01:26:00.809 --> 01:26:02.810
Have you seen an orange fish swim by?

1369
01:26:02.894 --> 01:26:04.895
-It looks like him.
-But bigger.

1370
01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:07.690
I saw him,
but I'm not telling you where he went.

1371
01:26:07.774 --> 01:26:11.235
And there's no way
you're going to make me.

1372
01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:14.947
Mine.

1373
01:26:15.032 --> 01:26:17.366
All right. I'll talk!

1374
01:26:17.451 --> 01:26:19.994
He went to the fishing grounds.

1375
01:26:24.958 --> 01:26:26.626
-Hey, look out.
-Sorry.

1376
01:26:26.710 --> 01:26:28.502
I'm just trying to get home.

1377
01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.257
Daddy!

1378
01:26:33.342 --> 01:26:36.093
-Nemo?
-Daddy!

1379
01:26:36.178 --> 01:26:37.261
Nemo?

1380
01:26:37.346 --> 01:26:39.180
-Dad!
-Nemo's alive!

1381
01:26:39.264 --> 01:26:40.514
Dory?

1382
01:26:40.599 --> 01:26:42.391
-Nemo!
-Daddy!

1383
01:26:42.476 --> 01:26:45.853
-Nemo! I'm coming, Nemo!
-Dad!

1384
01:26:45.937 --> 01:26:48.481
Nemo! Thank goodness.

1385
01:26:49.066 --> 01:26:51.400
It's all right, son. It's going to be okay.

1386
01:26:51.818 --> 01:26:54.195
Turn around!
You're going the wrong way.

1387
01:26:57.699 --> 01:26:59.825
-Look out!
-Move!

1388
01:27:21.223 --> 01:27:22.723
-Dory!
-Come on.

1389
01:27:24.309 --> 01:27:26.477
Help! Get us out!

1390
01:27:27.229 --> 01:27:29.563
No, no, no! Dory!

1391
01:27:29.648 --> 01:27:31.816
-Dad, I know what to do.
-Nemo, no!

1392
01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:34.652
We have to tell all the fish
to swim down together.

1393
01:27:34.736 --> 01:27:36.987
-Get out of there.
-This will work.

1394
01:27:37.072 --> 01:27:39.365
No, I am not going to lose you again.

1395
01:27:39.449 --> 01:27:42.827
There's no time.
It's the only way we can save Dory.

1396
01:27:44.371 --> 01:27:45.579
I can do this!

1397
01:27:47.374 --> 01:27:50.751
You're right. I know you can.

1398
01:27:51.128 --> 01:27:54.171
-Lucky fin.
-Now, go. Hurry!

1399
01:27:54.256 --> 01:27:56.549
Tell all the fish to swim down.

1400
01:27:56.967 --> 01:27:59.927
Well, you heard my son. Come on.

1401
01:28:01.763 --> 01:28:06.016
-Dory, you have to tell everybody to...
-Swim down together.

1402
01:28:06.101 --> 01:28:08.310
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1403
01:28:08.395 --> 01:28:10.187
Swim down!

1404
01:28:14.609 --> 01:28:18.362
-Everybody swim down.
-Come on. You have to swim down.

1405
01:28:18.447 --> 01:28:21.115
Down! Swim down!

1406
01:28:23.326 --> 01:28:26.829
Swim down! Swim down!

1407
01:28:34.796 --> 01:28:37.006
Don't give up! Keep swimming!

1408
01:28:38.133 --> 01:28:39.967
Just keep swimming!

1409
01:28:44.306 --> 01:28:45.306
That's it!

1410
01:28:48.894 --> 01:28:50.227
It's working!

1411
01:28:53.064 --> 01:28:56.192
Keep swimming!

1412
01:28:56.276 --> 01:28:58.819
Just keep swimming!

1413
01:28:58.904 --> 01:29:01.113
-Come on, Dad!
-You're doing great, son.

1414
01:29:01.198 --> 01:29:03.532
-That's my dad.
-Let's get to the bottom.

1415
01:29:04.659 --> 01:29:06.827
Just keep swimming

1416
01:29:06.912 --> 01:29:09.038
Almost there. Keep swimming!

1417
01:29:12.667 --> 01:29:17.379
Keep swimming!

1418
01:29:28.850 --> 01:29:29.934
Hey!

1419
01:29:30.018 --> 01:29:31.519
Where's Nemo?

1420
01:29:31.895 --> 01:29:32.978
There!

1421
01:29:35.649 --> 01:29:37.525
Oh, no. Nemo!

1422
01:29:44.533 --> 01:29:48.452
Nemo?

1423
01:29:50.205 --> 01:29:53.207
It's okay. Daddy's here.
Daddy's got you.

1424
01:29:58.505 --> 01:30:00.881
-Daddy?
-Oh, thank goodness.

1425
01:30:00.966 --> 01:30:02.716
Daddy...

1426
01:30:02.801 --> 01:30:05.553
-I don't hate you.
-Oh, no, no, no.

1427
01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:09.056
I'm so sorry, Nemo.

1428
01:30:18.608 --> 01:30:20.818
Hey, guess what?

1429
01:30:20.902 --> 01:30:23.279
-What?
-Sea turtles...

1430
01:30:23.363 --> 01:30:25.239
I met one.

1431
01:30:25.323 --> 01:30:29.118
And he was 150 years old.

1432
01:30:29.202 --> 01:30:31.161
150?

1433
01:30:31.246 --> 01:30:32.746
Yep.

1434
01:30:33.415 --> 01:30:37.501
'Cause Sandy Plankton said
they only lived to be 100.

1435
01:30:38.461 --> 01:30:39.920
Sandy Plankton?

1436
01:30:40.005 --> 01:30:43.841
Think I would cross the ocean and
not know as much as Sandy Plankton?

1437
01:30:43.925 --> 01:30:46.677
He was 150! Not 100.

1438
01:30:46.761 --> 01:30:50.097
Who is this Sandy Plankton
that knows everything wrong?

1439
01:30:52.434 --> 01:30:55.769
Time for school! Time for school!
Get up! Let's go!

1440
01:30:56.730 --> 01:30:59.565
-I'm going to win.
-No, you're not.

1441
01:30:59.649 --> 01:31:03.193
-I did it.
-My own son beats me.

1442
01:31:03.278 --> 01:31:05.321
Climb aboard, explorers.

1443
01:31:05.405 --> 01:31:08.699
So then the sea cucumber looks over
at the mollusk and says,

1444
01:31:08.783 --> 01:31:11.285
"With fronds like these,
who needs anemones?"

1445
01:31:13.538 --> 01:31:15.331
Well, hello, Nemo. Who's this?

1446
01:31:15.415 --> 01:31:18.751
-Exchange student.
-I'm from the EAC, dude.

1447
01:31:18.835 --> 01:31:21.128
-Sweet.
-Totally.

1448
01:31:22.047 --> 01:31:25.758
Seriously, Marty, did you really do
all the things you say you did?

1449
01:31:25.842 --> 01:31:27.134
Pardon me.

1450
01:31:28.011 --> 01:31:29.094
Hello.

1451
01:31:30.639 --> 01:31:32.181
Don't be alarmed.

1452
01:31:32.265 --> 01:31:35.392
We wanted to make sure
our newest member got home safely.

1453
01:31:35.477 --> 01:31:37.561
-Thanks.
-We'll see you next week.

1454
01:31:37.646 --> 01:31:41.190
-Keep up with the programme, Dory.
-Remember, fish are friends.

1455
01:31:41.274 --> 01:31:43.609
Not food! Bye!

1456
01:31:43.693 --> 01:31:45.569
Hold on. Here we go.

1457
01:31:45.654 --> 01:31:47.363
Next stop, knowledge.

1458
01:31:47.447 --> 01:31:49.907
Bye, son. Have fun.

1459
01:31:49.991 --> 01:31:51.116
Bye, Dad.

1460
01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:54.495
Mr Ray, wait. I forgot something.

1461
01:31:59.668 --> 01:32:01.335
Love you, Dad.

1462
01:32:02.545 --> 01:32:04.546
I love you, too, son.

1463
01:32:07.342 --> 01:32:09.760
Dad? You can let go now.

1464
01:32:09.844 --> 01:32:11.178
Sorry.

1465
01:32:11.262 --> 01:32:13.389
Now go have an adventure.

1466
01:32:13.473 --> 01:32:15.766
Goodbye. See you later, dudes!

1467
01:32:15.850 --> 01:32:17.601
-Bye, Elmo.
-Nemo.

1468
01:32:17.686 --> 01:32:21.188
-Nemo. Bye, Nemo.
-See you after school, Dory.

1469
01:32:22.065 --> 01:32:23.357
Bye, Dad!

1470
01:32:24.859 --> 01:32:26.360
Bye, son.

1471
01:32:44.295 --> 01:32:45.462
Barbara.

1472
01:32:45.547 --> 01:32:47.006
I don't understand it.

1473
01:32:47.090 --> 01:32:50.384
Here this thing has a lifetime guarantee
and it breaks.

1474
01:32:50.468 --> 01:32:55.055
Had to clean the tank myself,
take the fish out, put 'em in bags and...

1475
01:32:55.557 --> 01:32:57.391
Where'd the fish go?

1476
01:33:02.856 --> 01:33:05.149
Come on, Peach!

1477
01:33:05.233 --> 01:33:07.693
You got it. That's it. You can do it.

1478
01:33:07.777 --> 01:33:10.029
That's the shortest red light
I've ever seen.

1479
01:33:10.113 --> 01:33:11.864
Come on, Peach.

1480
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:31.750
Now what?
