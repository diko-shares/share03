00:00:53.555 --> 00:00:55.306
MALE FISH: Wow.
FEMALE FISH: Mmm.

2
00:00:56.808 --> 00:00:58.601
- Wow.
- Mmm-hmm.

3
00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:02.021
- Wow.
- Yes, Marlin.

4
00:01:02.105 --> 00:01:04.107
I see it. It's beautiful.

5
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.901
So, Coral, when you said
you wanted an ocean view,

6
00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:10.655
you didn't think you were going
to get the whole ocean, did you?

7
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.700
Oh, yeah!

8
00:01:13.783 --> 00:01:17.829
A fish can breathe out here.
Did your man deliver or did he deliver?

9
00:01:17.912 --> 00:01:19.163
My man delivered.

10
00:01:19.247 --> 00:01:20.331
It wasn't so easy.

11
00:01:20.456 --> 00:01:23.251
A lot of clownfish
had their eyes on this place.

12
00:01:23.334 --> 00:01:27.046
You better believe they did.
Every single one of them.

13
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:30.341
You did good
and the neighbourhood is awesome.

14
00:01:34.012 --> 00:01:36.014
(LAUGHTER OF YOUNG FISH)

15
00:01:40.852 --> 00:01:42.312
So you do like it, don't you?

16
00:01:42.395 --> 00:01:45.815
No, no, I really do like it.

17
00:01:45.898 --> 00:01:48.901
But, Marlin, I know that
the Drop Off is desirable,

18
00:01:48.985 --> 00:01:50.903
great schools, amazing view,

19
00:01:50.987 --> 00:01:53.448
but do we really need so much space?

20
00:01:53.573 --> 00:01:56.075
Coral, honey,
these are our kids we're talking about.

21
00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.285
They deserve the best.

22
00:01:57.368 --> 00:02:01.539
Look. They'll wake up, poke their
little heads out and see a whale

23
00:02:02.123 --> 00:02:03.833
- right by their bedroom window!
- Shh!

24
00:02:04.334 --> 00:02:07.545
- You're going to wake the kids.
- Oh, right. Right.

25
00:02:11.215 --> 00:02:12.467
Aw, look.

26
00:02:13.885 --> 00:02:15.887
They're dreaming.

27
00:02:16.721 --> 00:02:18.556
We still have to name them.

28
00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:20.308
All of them? Right now?

29
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:23.519
All right. We'll name
this half Marlin Jr

30
00:02:23.603 --> 00:02:25.730
and this half Coral Jr.

31
00:02:25.855 --> 00:02:26.814
Okay, we're done.

32
00:02:26.898 --> 00:02:28.274
I like Nemo.

33
00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:29.776
Nemo?

34
00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:33.655
We'll name one Nemo,
but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr.

35
00:02:33.738 --> 00:02:36.658
In a couple of days,
we're going to be parents!

36
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:37.909
Yeah.

37
00:02:39.077 --> 00:02:41.579
- What if they don't like me?
- Marlin...

38
00:02:41.913 --> 00:02:43.289
There's over 400 eggs.

39
00:02:43.414 --> 00:02:46.501
Odds are one of them
is bound to like you.

40
00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:50.880
What?

41
00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:52.674
You remember how we met?

42
00:02:52.757 --> 00:02:54.342
I try not to.

43
00:02:54.425 --> 00:02:55.593
Well, I remember.

44
00:02:56.177 --> 00:02:58.554
Excuse me, miss.
Can you see if I have a hook in my lip?

45
00:02:58.638 --> 00:03:00.848
- Marlin.
- Look closer.

46
00:03:00.932 --> 00:03:04.143
- CORAL: (LAUGHS) Get away!
- Here he is. Cutie's here!

47
00:03:06.437 --> 00:03:08.398
Where did everybody go?

48
00:03:15.488 --> 00:03:17.115
Coral, get inside the house.

49
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.078
No, don't. They'll be fine.
Just get inside.

50
00:03:22.161 --> 00:03:23.830
You. Right now.

51
00:03:47.103 --> 00:03:48.104
Coral!

52
00:04:41.616 --> 00:04:43.659
There, there.

53
00:04:43.743 --> 00:04:45.620
It's okay. Daddy's here.

54
00:04:47.246 --> 00:04:48.956
Daddy's got you.

55
00:04:52.043 --> 00:04:56.214
I promise I will never let
anything happen to you,

56
00:04:56.297 --> 00:04:57.590
Nemo.

57
00:05:35.962 --> 00:05:37.839
First day of school! Wake up!

58
00:05:38.256 --> 00:05:39.841
Come on. First day of school.

59
00:05:39.924 --> 00:05:42.260
I don't want to go to school.

60
00:05:42.343 --> 00:05:44.136
- Not you, Dad. Me.
- Okay.

61
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.222
Get up! Time for school!

62
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.933
- All right, I'm up. It's time for school.
- Oh, boy!

63
00:05:50.893 --> 00:05:52.019
Nemo!

64
00:05:52.103 --> 00:05:53.229
First day of school!

65
00:05:53.312 --> 00:05:54.856
Don't move.

66
00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:58.442
You'll never get out of there yourself.
I'll do it.

67
00:05:58.526 --> 00:06:00.361
- You feel a break?
- No.

68
00:06:00.444 --> 00:06:03.614
Sometimes fluid is rushing to the area.
Any rushing fluids?

69
00:06:03.698 --> 00:06:06.450
- No.
- How many stripes do I have?

70
00:06:06.534 --> 00:06:08.369
- Answer the question.
- Three.

71
00:06:08.452 --> 00:06:11.873
No! Something's wrong with you.
I have one, two...

72
00:06:11.956 --> 00:06:13.791
Three. That's all I have?

73
00:06:13.916 --> 00:06:15.793
You're okay. How's the lucky fin?

74
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.254
- Lucky.
- Let's see.

75
00:06:20.381 --> 00:06:23.134
Sure you want to go to school this year?

76
00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:24.760
You can wait five or six years.

77
00:06:24.844 --> 00:06:26.971
Come on, Dad. It's time for school.

78
00:06:27.638 --> 00:06:29.265
- Forgot to brush.
- (SIGHS)

79
00:06:29.348 --> 00:06:31.809
Do you want this anemone to sting you?

80
00:06:31.934 --> 00:06:33.311
- Yes.
- Brush.

81
00:06:34.186 --> 00:06:35.938
- I'm done.
- You missed a spot.

82
00:06:36.022 --> 00:06:37.857
- Where?
- There.

83
00:06:37.982 --> 00:06:40.318
Right there. And here and here.

84
00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:54.540
We're excited. First day of school.
Here we go. We're ready to learn.

85
00:06:54.624 --> 00:06:56.876
What do we have to remember
about the ocean?

86
00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:57.960
It's not safe.

87
00:06:58.044 --> 00:06:59.462
That's my boy.

88
00:06:59.545 --> 00:07:04.342
First, we check to see that the coast
is clear. We go out and back in.

89
00:07:04.425 --> 00:07:06.636
Then we go out and back in.

90
00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:09.639
Then one more time. Out and back in.

91
00:07:09.722 --> 00:07:12.350
- If you want to do it four times...
- Dad...

92
00:07:12.475 --> 00:07:14.352
All right. Come on, boy.

93
00:07:16.854 --> 00:07:19.690
Maybe while I'm at school,
I'll see a shark.

94
00:07:19.815 --> 00:07:20.775
I doubt that.

95
00:07:20.858 --> 00:07:22.443
Have you ever met a shark?

96
00:07:22.526 --> 00:07:23.986
No, and I don't plan to.

97
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.154
How old are sea turtles?

98
00:07:25.237 --> 00:07:27.448
Sea turtles? I don't know.

99
00:07:27.531 --> 00:07:29.951
Sandy Plankton from next door said that

100
00:07:30.034 --> 00:07:34.163
sea turtles live to be
about 100 years old.

101
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.834
If I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him,
after I'm done talking to the shark.

102
00:07:38.918 --> 00:07:40.962
Hold on. Wait to cross.

103
00:07:42.505 --> 00:07:44.632
Hold my fin. Hold my fin.

104
00:07:44.715 --> 00:07:47.969
You're not going to freak out
like you did at the petting zoo.

105
00:07:48.052 --> 00:07:50.554
That snail was about to charge.

106
00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:53.516
I wonder where we're supposed to go.

107
00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:56.727
- Bye, Mom.
- I'll pick you up after school.

108
00:07:58.646 --> 00:08:01.565
Come on, you guys.
Stop it. Give it back.

109
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.568
Come on. We'll try over there.

110
00:08:05.778 --> 00:08:08.531
Excuse me.
Is this where we meet his teacher?

111
00:08:08.698 --> 00:08:10.533
Look who's out of the anemone.

112
00:08:10.616 --> 00:08:12.243
Yes, shocking, I know.

113
00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:13.661
- Marty?
- Marlin.

114
00:08:13.744 --> 00:08:14.745
- Bob.
- Ted.

115
00:08:14.829 --> 00:08:16.831
Phil. Hey, you're a clownfish.

116
00:08:17.456 --> 00:08:19.667
You're funny, right? Tell us a joke.

117
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.086
- Yeah.
- Good idea.

118
00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:26.257
That's a misconception. Clownfish are
no funnier than any other fish.

119
00:08:26.424 --> 00:08:29.051
- Come on, Clowny.
- Do something funny.

120
00:08:29.176 --> 00:08:31.220
All right. I know one joke.

121
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:35.349
There's a mollusk. He walks up to...

122
00:08:35.433 --> 00:08:37.018
Well, he swims up.

123
00:08:37.268 --> 00:08:41.022
Actually, the mollusk isn't moving.
He's in one place.

124
00:08:41.105 --> 00:08:42.523
And then the sea cucumber...

125
00:08:43.524 --> 00:08:46.777
I'm mixed up. There was
a mollusk and a sea cucumber.

126
00:08:46.944 --> 00:08:48.779
None of them were walking...

127
00:08:48.904 --> 00:08:51.991
Sheldon!
Get out of Mr Johanssen's yard now!

128
00:08:52.908 --> 00:08:55.036
All right, you kids!

129
00:08:55.119 --> 00:08:57.121
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

130
00:08:57.246 --> 00:08:59.623
Can I go play, too? Can I?

131
00:08:59.707 --> 00:09:02.376
I would feel better if you go play
over on the sponge beds.

132
00:09:04.336 --> 00:09:06.964
- (MOTHER GASPS)
- (BABY CRIES)

133
00:09:07.715 --> 00:09:08.883
That's where I would play.

134
00:09:10.718 --> 00:09:12.011
What's wrong with his fin?

135
00:09:12.094 --> 00:09:13.971
He looks funny.

136
00:09:14.055 --> 00:09:15.765
Hey, what did I do?

137
00:09:15.848 --> 00:09:17.558
Be nice. It's his first time at school.

138
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:20.102
He was born with it.
We call it his lucky fin.

139
00:09:20.227 --> 00:09:21.270
Dad...

140
00:09:21.353 --> 00:09:25.107
See this tentacle?
It's shorter than all my other tentacles.

141
00:09:25.191 --> 00:09:29.570
But you can't really tell.
Especially when I twirl them like this.

142
00:09:29.653 --> 00:09:31.614
I'm H2O intolerant.

143
00:09:32.615 --> 00:09:34.158
I'm obnoxious.

Dad, you can go now.

156
00:10:06.023 --> 00:10:08.943
- Well, hello. Who is this?
- I'm Nemo.

157
00:10:09.026 --> 00:10:12.446
Nemo, all new explorers
must answer a science question.

158
00:10:12.696 --> 00:10:15.574
- Okay.
- You live in what kind of home?

159
00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:19.787
In an anemoninny.
Anemonemenemone.

160
00:10:19.912 --> 00:10:22.289
Don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard.

161
00:10:22.373 --> 00:10:24.416
Just so you know, he's got a little fin.

162
00:10:24.542 --> 00:10:28.003
If he's having trouble swimming,
let him take a break. 15 minutes.

163
00:10:28.087 --> 00:10:30.256
Dad, it's time for you to go now.

164
00:10:30.339 --> 00:10:32.424
We're going to stay together.

165
00:10:32.508 --> 00:10:35.136
Okay, class. Optical orbits up front.

166
00:10:35.219 --> 00:10:39.598
Remember, we keep our
supraesophageal ganglion to ourselves.

167
00:10:39.682 --> 00:10:42.309
- That means you, Jimmy.
- Oh, man!

168
00:10:43.644 --> 00:10:45.813
- Bye, Nemo.
- Bye, Dad.

169
00:10:46.522 --> 00:10:47.523
Bye, son.

170
00:10:50.317 --> 00:10:51.986
Be safe.

171
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:54.446
You're doing well for a first
timer.

172
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.824
You can't hold on to them forever,
can you?

173
00:10:56.907 --> 00:11:00.077
I had a tough time when
my eldest went out on the Drop Off.

174
00:11:00.161 --> 00:11:02.705
The Drop Off!
They're going to the Drop Off?

175
00:11:02.788 --> 00:11:04.415
Are you insane?

176
00:11:04.498 --> 00:11:07.251
Why don't we fry them up now
and serve them with chips?

177
00:11:07.418 --> 00:11:09.044
Hey, Marty, calm down.

178
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:10.921
Don't tell me to be calm, pony-boy.

179
00:11:12.089 --> 00:11:13.674
Pony-boy?

180
00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:16.510
For a clownfish,
he really isn't that funny.

181
00:11:16.594 --> 00:11:17.595
Pity.

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:59.053
All right, kids.
Feel free to explore, but stay close.

203
00:12:33.837 --> 00:12:34.880
What's that?

204
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.343
I know what that is.
Sandy Plankton saw one.

205
00:12:40.344 --> 00:12:42.680
He said it was called a butt.

206
00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:46.350
Wow. That's a pretty big butt.

207
00:12:48.018 --> 00:12:51.438
Look at me.
I'm going to go touch the butt.

208
00:12:52.231 --> 00:12:53.440
(LAUGHTER)

209
00:12:54.108 --> 00:12:56.277
Oh, yeah? Let's see you get closer.

210
00:12:56.527 --> 00:12:57.736
Okay.

211
00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:00.155
Beat that.

212
00:13:01.198 --> 00:13:03.075
Come on, Nemo. How far can you go?

213
00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:05.869
My dad says it's not safe.

214
00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:07.454
Nemo, no!

215
00:13:07.705 --> 00:13:08.706
Dad?

216
00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:10.457
You were about to
swim into open water.

217
00:13:10.582 --> 00:13:11.583
No!

218
00:13:11.709 --> 00:13:13.419
Good thing I was here.

219
00:13:13.544 --> 00:13:14.712
He wasn't going to go.

220
00:13:14.837 --> 00:13:16.005
He was too afraid.

221
00:13:16.088 --> 00:13:18.590
- I wasn't.
- This does not concern you.

222
00:13:18.716 --> 00:13:22.052
You're lucky I don't tell your parents.
You can't swim well.

223
00:13:22.219 --> 00:13:24.221
I can swim fine, Dad, okay?

224
00:13:24.346 --> 00:13:25.431
No. It's not okay.

225
00:13:25.556 --> 00:13:26.890
You shouldn't be near here.

226
00:13:27.266 --> 00:13:29.601
You'll start school in a year or two.

227
00:13:29.727 --> 00:13:32.730
No. Just because
you're scared of the ocean...

228
00:13:32.896 --> 00:13:34.773
Clearly you're not ready.

229
00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:37.735
You think you can do these things,
but you just can't Nemo!

230
00:13:39.403 --> 00:13:40.738

Anything I can do?
I am a scientist. Is there any problem?

234
00:13:50.414 --> 00:13:53.542
I didn't mean to interrupt.
He isn't a good swimmer.

235
00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:56.795
I think it's too soon
for him to be out here unsupervised.

236
00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.089
MR RAY: I can assure you,
he's quite safe with me.

237
00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:00.215
MARLIN: I'm sure he is.

238
00:14:00.591 --> 00:14:03.594
But you have a large class
and he can get lost from sight

239
00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:05.637
if you're not looking.

240
00:14:05.763 --> 00:14:08.432
Oh, my gosh!
Nemo's swimming out to sea.

241
00:14:10.559 --> 00:14:11.560

242
00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.730
What do you think you're doing?

243
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.816
You're going to get stuck

244
00:14:17.941 --> 00:14:20.778
and I'm going to have to get you
before another fish does.

245
00:14:21.612 --> 00:14:23.489
Get back here.

246
00:14:23.822 --> 00:14:25.949
I said get back here now!

247
00:14:27.284 --> 00:14:28.827
Stop.

248
00:14:28.952 --> 00:14:30.829
You take one more move, mister...

249
00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:35.334
Don't you dare.
If you put one fin on that boat...

250
00:14:35.459 --> 00:14:36.919
Are you listening to me?

251
00:14:37.002 --> 00:14:38.962

253
00:14:40.464 --> 00:14:41.757
He touched the butt.

254
00:14:41.924 --> 00:14:44.676
You paddle your little tail
back here.

255
00:14:44.802 --> 00:14:47.429
That's right.
You are in big trouble, young man.

256
00:14:47.638 --> 00:14:49.681

Are you okay?

281
00:16:49.718 --> 00:16:51.261
- He's gone.
- There, there.

282
00:16:51.428 --> 00:16:53.096
- He's gone.
- It's all right.

283
00:16:53.222 --> 00:16:55.557
- It'll be okay.
- No, they took him away.

284
00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:57.226
I have to find the boat.

285
00:16:57.351 --> 00:16:59.895
- A boat? I've seen a boat.
- You have?

286
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.522
And it passed by not too long ago.

287
00:17:01.605 --> 00:17:03.023
A white one?

288
00:17:03.106 --> 00:17:05.192
- Hi. I'm Dory.
- Where? Which way?

289
00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:08.278
Oh. It went this way.

290
00:17:08.362 --> 00:17:10.572
- Follow me.
- Thank you.

291
00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:12.032
Thank you so much.

292
00:17:12.115 --> 00:17:13.617
No problem.

293
00:17:40.227 --> 00:17:41.228
Wait.

294
00:17:48.277 --> 00:17:52.322
Quit it. I'm trying to swim here.
The ocean isn't big enough for you?

295
00:17:52.489 --> 00:17:54.491
You got a problem, buddy?

Do you? Do you?

297
00:17:55.951 --> 00:17:58.120
Want a piece of me? Yeah.

298
00:17:58.245 --> 00:17:59.663
I'm scared now!

299
00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.748
- Wait.
- Stop following me, okay?

300
00:18:01.832 --> 00:18:04.918
What? You're showing me
which way the boat went.

301
00:18:05.002 --> 00:18:08.672
A boat? I've seen a boat.
It passed by not too long ago.

302
00:18:08.839 --> 00:18:11.675
It went this way. Follow me.

303
00:18:11.842 --> 00:18:13.844
Wait a minute. What is going on?

304
00:18:13.969 --> 00:18:15.929
You already told me
which way the boat was going.

305
00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:19.182
I did? Oh, no.

306
00:18:19.308 --> 00:18:23.061
If this is some kind of joke,
it's not funny and I know funny.

307
00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:27.357
- I'm a clownfish.
- No, it's not. I'm so sorry.

308
00:18:27.858 --> 00:18:30.861
See, I suffer from
short-term memory loss.

309
00:18:30.986 --> 00:18:33.238
Short-term memory loss.

310
00:18:33.363 --> 00:18:35.198
- I don't believe this.
- No.

311
00:18:35.324 --> 00:18:38.744
I forget things almost instantly.
It runs in my family.

312
00:18:38.869 --> 00:18:42.080
At least I think it does. Uh... Hmm.

313
00:18:42.914 --> 00:18:44.458
Where are they?

314
00:18:49.046 --> 00:18:50.047
Can I help you?

315
00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:53.467
Something's wrong with you. Really.

316
00:18:53.592 --> 00:18:55.385
You're wasting my time.

317
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:56.678
I have to find my son.

318
00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:01.767
Hello.

319
00:19:02.643 --> 00:19:03.810
Well, hi!

320
00:19:04.853 --> 00:19:06.396
Name's Bruce.

321
00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:09.149
It's all right. I understand.

322
00:19:09.274 --> 00:19:11.693
Why trust a shark, right?

323
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.072
(LAUGHS)

324
00:19:19.868 --> 00:19:24.331
So, what's a couple of bites like you
doing out so late?

325
00:19:24.498 --> 00:19:26.458
Nothing. We're not even out.

326
00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:27.793
Great.

327
00:19:27.918 --> 00:19:32.339
Then how would you morsels like to
come to a little get-together I'm having?

328
00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:33.465
You mean like a party?

329
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.677
Yeah, right. A party.

330
00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:37.803
What do you say?

331
00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:39.930
I love parties. That sounds like fun.

332
00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:43.558
Parties are fun and it's tempting,
but we can't because...

333
00:19:43.684 --> 00:19:46.103
Come on. I insist.

334
00:19:46.228 --> 00:19:48.647
Okay. That's all that matters.

335
00:19:52.109 --> 00:19:54.444
DORY: Look. Balloons. It is a party.

336
00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:59.491
Mind your distance, though.
Those balloons can be a bit dodgy.

337
00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:01.326
You wouldn't want one of them to pop.

338
00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:17.926
Anchor! Chum!

339
00:20:19.052 --> 00:20:20.762
There you are, Bruce. Finally.

340
00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:22.347
We got company.

341
00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:23.682
It's about time, mate.

342
00:20:23.807 --> 00:20:26.560
We've gone through the snacks
and I'm starving.

343
00:20:26.685 --> 00:20:28.770
We almost had to have
a feeding frenzy.

344
00:20:28.937 --> 00:20:30.564
Let's get this over with.

345
00:20:30.814 --> 00:20:31.815
(DING)

346
00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:36.111
Right then. The meeting has
officially come to order.

347
00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:37.863
Let us all say the pledge.

348
00:20:37.988 --> 00:20:39.823
ALL: I am a nice shark,

349
00:20:39.948 --> 00:20:42.242
not a mindless eating machine.

350
00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:46.955
If I am to change this image,
I must first change myself.

351
00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:49.708
Fish are friends, not food.

352
00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:51.460
Except stinking dolphins.

353
00:20:51.585 --> 00:20:54.421
Dolphins!
Yeah, they think they're so cute.

354
00:20:54.546 --> 00:20:58.592
Look, I'm a flipping little dolphin.
Let me flip for you. Ain't I something?

355
00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:02.262
Today's meeting is step five:
Bring a Fish Friend.

356
00:21:02.387 --> 00:21:03.472
Do you all have your friends?

357
00:21:03.555 --> 00:21:04.556
Got mine.

358
00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:09.102
DORY: Hey there!
BRUCE: How about you, Chum?

359
00:21:09.227 --> 00:21:12.898
Well, I seem to have misplaced my

360
00:21:13.023 --> 00:21:14.566
friend.

361
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.651
It's all right, Chum.

362
00:21:16.777 --> 00:21:19.654
Help yourself to one of my friends.

363
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.200
Thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum.

364
00:21:23.325 --> 00:21:26.870
I'll start the testimonies.
Hello. My name is Bruce.

365
00:21:26.995 --> 00:21:28.163
Hello, Bruce.

366
00:21:28.288 --> 00:21:31.500
It has been three weeks
since my last fish, on my honour,

367
00:21:31.625 --> 00:21:33.835
or may I be chopped up
and made into soup.

368
00:21:34.586 --> 00:21:36.630
- You're an inspiration to us.
- Amen.

369
00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:39.257
Right, then. Who's next?

370
00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:40.634
Pick me. Pick me.

371
00:21:40.759 --> 00:21:42.552
The little sheila down the front.

372
00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:44.971
Come on up here.

373
00:21:46.223 --> 00:21:47.557
Hi. I'm Dory.

374
00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:49.267
Hello, Dory.

375
00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:52.687
And... Well, I don't think
I've ever eaten a fish.

376
00:21:54.147 --> 00:21:56.775
- Hey, that's incredible.
- Good on you, mate!

377
00:21:57.442 --> 00:21:58.860
I'm glad I got that off my chest.

378
00:21:58.985 --> 00:22:03.198
Anyone else? How about you, mate?
What's your problem?

379
00:22:03.323 --> 00:22:05.617
Me? I don't have a problem.

380
00:22:05.867 --> 00:22:06.868
Okay.

381
00:22:06.993 --> 00:22:08.161
ALL: Denial.

382
00:22:08.578 --> 00:22:10.539
Just start with your name.

383
00:22:10.664 --> 00:22:12.874
Okay. Hello.

384
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.877
My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish.

385
00:22:16.086 --> 00:22:17.420
A clownfish? Really?

386
00:22:17.546 --> 00:22:19.548
Go on. Tell us a joke.

387
00:22:19.673 --> 00:22:20.757
I love jokes.

388
00:22:21.132 --> 00:22:24.135
I actually do know
one that's pretty good.

389
00:22:25.136 --> 00:22:28.640
There was this mollusk
and he walks up to a sea cucumber.

390
00:22:28.765 --> 00:22:32.102
Normally they don't talk,
but in a joke, everyone talks.

391
00:22:32.227 --> 00:22:35.188
The sea mollusk
says to the cucumber...

392
00:22:37.774 --> 00:22:39.025
Daddy!

393
00:22:39.568 --> 00:22:40.652
Nemo!

394
00:22:40.986 --> 00:22:42.821
Nemo! (LAUGHS)

395
00:22:43.613 --> 00:22:45.866
- I don't get it.
- For a clownfish he's not that funny.

396
00:22:45.991 --> 00:22:50.495
No, he's my son.
He was taken by these divers.

397
00:22:51.162 --> 00:22:53.039
You poor fish.

398
00:22:53.164 --> 00:22:54.916
Humans. Think they own everything.

399
00:22:55.041 --> 00:22:56.418
Probably American.

400
00:22:56.543 --> 00:23:00.547
(TEARFULLY) There is a father
looking for his little boy.

401
00:23:01.006 --> 00:23:02.632
MARLIN:
What do these markings mean?

402
00:23:02.757 --> 00:23:05.343
(SOBS) I never knew my father.

403
00:23:05.468 --> 00:23:06.636
Come here.

404
00:23:06.761 --> 00:23:07.721
We're all mates here.

405
00:23:07.804 --> 00:23:08.889
I can't read human.

406
00:23:08.972 --> 00:23:12.017
Then we've got to find a fish
that can read this. Look. Sharks!

407
00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:14.436
- Guys.
- No, Dory.

408
00:23:14.561 --> 00:23:16.855
- That's mine. Give it back.
- Cut it out.

409
00:23:17.022 --> 00:23:20.609
- Ow!
- I'm sorry. Are you okay?

410
00:23:20.734 --> 00:23:23.570
You really clocked me there.
Am I bleeding?

411
00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.073
Dory, are you oka... (SNIFFS)

412
00:23:27.157 --> 00:23:28.658
Oh!

413
00:23:30.201 --> 00:23:31.661
That's good.

414
00:23:32.203 --> 00:23:33.538
Intervention!

415
00:23:34.372 --> 00:23:37.292
- Just a bite.
- You hold it together, mate.

416
00:23:37.417 --> 00:23:39.085
Fish are friends, not food.

417
00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.253
Food!

418
00:23:41.087 --> 00:23:42.839
Dory, look out.

419
00:23:42.964 --> 00:23:45.800
I'm having fish tonight.

420
00:23:45.926 --> 00:23:47.010
Remember the steps, mate.

421
00:23:48.136 --> 00:23:49.262
The steps!

422
00:23:53.016 --> 00:23:54.225
Just one bite.

423
00:23:58.772 --> 00:23:59.814
G'day.

424
00:24:03.568 --> 00:24:06.071
There's no way out.
There's got to be a way to escape.

425
00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.992
- Who is it?
- Help me find a way out.

426
00:24:11.159 --> 00:24:13.912
Sorry. You'll have to come back later.
We're trying to escape.

427
00:24:14.871 --> 00:24:17.457
There's no way out.
There's got to be a way out.

428
00:24:17.582 --> 00:24:21.670
Here's something. "Es-ca-pé."
I wonder what that means.

429
00:24:21.795 --> 00:24:23.797
- It's spelled just like the word "escape."
- Let's go.

430
00:24:24.422 --> 00:24:26.925
Here's Brucie!

431
00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.135
Wait a minute. You can read?

432
00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.179
I can read? That's right!

433
00:24:31.304 --> 00:24:32.889
Then here. Read this now.

434
00:24:34.808 --> 00:24:37.686
He doesn't mean it.
He never even knew his father.

435
00:24:37.852 --> 00:24:39.896
Don't fall off the wagon.

436
00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:45.443
Oh, no! It's blocked.

437
00:24:49.864 --> 00:24:50.991
No, Bruce!

438
00:24:51.449 --> 00:24:53.660
Sorry about... Bruce, mate.

439
00:24:53.785 --> 00:24:55.870
He's really... A nice guy.

440
00:24:55.996 --> 00:24:57.580
I need to get that mask.

441
00:24:57.706 --> 00:24:59.165
You want that mask? Okay.

442
00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:01.376
No, no, no, no!

443
00:25:02.585 --> 00:25:04.087
Quick. Grab the mask.

444
00:25:08.967 --> 00:25:11.261
Oh, no. Bruce.

445
00:25:11.386 --> 00:25:12.512
What?

446
00:25:14.681 --> 00:25:17.434
Swim away!

447
00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:18.852
DORY: Is the party over?

448
00:25:18.935 --> 00:25:19.936
(PING)

449
00:25:28.778 --> 00:25:30.113
Nice.

450
00:25:33.783 --> 00:25:35.076
Dad!

451
00:25:37.746 --> 00:25:39.122
Daddy?

452
00:26:02.145 --> 00:26:03.229
SHERMAN: Barbara.

453
00:26:03.396 --> 00:26:05.106
Prep for his anterior crown,
would you, please?

454
00:26:05.565 --> 00:26:08.651
- And I'll need more cotton rolls.
- All right.

455
00:26:11.654 --> 00:26:12.655
Hello, little fella.

456
00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.241
Beauty, isn't he?

457
00:26:15.325 --> 00:26:18.828
I found that guy struggling for life
and I saved him.

458
00:26:18.953 --> 00:26:20.997
- Has that Novocain kicked in yet?
- (PATIENT GABBLES)

459
00:26:25.168 --> 00:26:26.336
Bubbles!

460
00:26:29.964 --> 00:26:30.965
My bubbles.

461
00:26:31.674 --> 00:26:33.176
He likes bubbles.

462
00:26:33.343 --> 00:26:35.011
(FRIGHTENED CRIES)

463
00:26:39.182 --> 00:26:40.892
(WHIMPERS)

464
00:26:44.229 --> 00:26:45.355
<i>- Bonjour.</i>
- Aagghh!

465
00:26:46.356 --> 00:26:50.026
Slow down, little fella.
There's nothing to worry about.

466
00:26:50.151 --> 00:26:51.152
He's scared to death.

467
00:26:51.277 --> 00:26:52.278
I want to go home.

468
00:26:53.196 --> 00:26:54.864
Do you know where my dad is?

469
00:26:54.989 --> 00:26:57.158
Your dad's probably
back at the pet store.

470
00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:58.785
Pet store?

471
00:26:58.868 --> 00:27:01.871
- Like I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.
- Pet Palace.

472
00:27:02.038 --> 00:27:03.498
- Fish-O-Rama.
- Mail order.

473
00:27:03.623 --> 00:27:04.624
eBay.

474
00:27:04.958 --> 00:27:07.377
- Which one is it?
- I'm from the ocean.

475
00:27:07.502 --> 00:27:10.380
Ah, the ocean. The ocean! Aagghh!

476
00:27:11.172 --> 00:27:14.050
He hasn't been decontaminated yet.
Jacques!

477
00:27:14.217 --> 00:27:15.510
- Clean him!
<i>- Oui.</i>

478
00:27:17.053 --> 00:27:18.513
- Ocean.
<i>- La mer.</i>

479
00:27:21.474 --> 00:27:22.892
<i>Voilà</i>. He is clean.

480
00:27:25.979 --> 00:27:29.065
Wow. The big blue. What's it like?

481
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.985
Uh... Big and blue?

482
00:27:32.068 --> 00:27:33.069
I knew it.

483
00:27:33.194 --> 00:27:36.573
If there's anything you need,
ask your Auntie Deb. That's me.

484
00:27:36.698 --> 00:27:41.244
If I'm not around you can always
talk to my sister, Flo. Hi. How are you?

485
00:27:41.369 --> 00:27:44.372
Don't listen to anything my sister says.
She's nuts.

486
00:27:44.455 --> 00:27:45.498
(MUFFLED CALL)

487
00:27:45.665 --> 00:27:46.833
Can't hear you, Peach.

488
00:27:47.167 --> 00:27:48.543
I said we got a live one.

489
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:50.086
- Yes!
- Boy, oh, boy.

490
00:27:50.211 --> 00:27:52.338
- What have we got?
- Root canal.

491
00:27:52.422 --> 00:27:53.590
It's not going to be pretty.

492
00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:55.425
Aagghh!

493
00:27:55.508 --> 00:27:56.926
- Clamp installed?
- Yup.

494
00:27:57.051 --> 00:28:00.388
- What did he use to open?
- Glidden drill. He favours that one.

495
00:28:01.264 --> 00:28:03.349
I can't see, Flo.

496
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.518
(MUMBLES) Agh!

497
00:28:05.602 --> 00:28:07.020
Schilder Technique.

498
00:28:07.103 --> 00:28:08.188
That's a Hedstrom file.

499
00:28:08.354 --> 00:28:10.773
That's not a Hedstrom file.
That's a K-Flex.

500
00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:13.902
It's got a teardrop cross section.
A Hedstrom.

501
00:28:14.027 --> 00:28:16.613
- K-Flex!
- Hedstrom!

502
00:28:16.779 --> 00:28:18.781
There I go. Little help. Over here.

503
00:28:18.948 --> 00:28:20.783
I'll go deflate him.

504
00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:21.910
Pffft!

505
00:28:22.785 --> 00:28:24.245
All right. Go ahead and rinse.

506
00:28:25.955 --> 00:28:28.291
The human mouth
is a disgusting place.

507
00:28:31.211 --> 00:28:32.795
- Nigel.
- What did I miss?

508
00:28:32.962 --> 00:28:34.297
Root canal. A doozy.

509
00:28:34.422 --> 00:28:35.924
What did he use to open?

510
00:28:36.049 --> 00:28:37.592
- Glidden drill.
- He favours it.

511
00:28:37.759 --> 00:28:40.929
Hope he doesn't get surplus sealer
at the portal terminus.

512
00:28:41.054 --> 00:28:42.555
Hello. Who's this?

513
00:28:42.639 --> 00:28:43.973
New guy.

514
00:28:44.098 --> 00:28:45.433
The dentist took him off the reef.

515
00:28:45.558 --> 00:28:46.559
An outie.

516
00:28:46.726 --> 00:28:49.479
From my neck of the woods?
Sorry if I took a snap at you.

517
00:28:49.604 --> 00:28:51.648
Fish got to swim. Birds got to eat.

518
00:28:51.814 --> 00:28:56.277
No, no. Those aren't your fish.
They're my fish. Come on. Go. Shoo.

519
00:28:58.988 --> 00:29:02.283
The picture broke.
This here's Darla. She's my niece.

520
00:29:02.408 --> 00:29:03.409
Going to be eight this week.

521
00:29:03.493 --> 00:29:06.621
Hey, little fella.
Say hello to your new mummy.

522
00:29:06.746 --> 00:29:09.123
She's going to be here Friday
to pick you up.

523
00:29:09.249 --> 00:29:10.959
You're her present.

524
00:29:11.042 --> 00:29:13.086
Shh! It's our little secret.

525
00:29:13.169 --> 00:29:14.462
Well, Mr Tucker,

your fins and your tail.

I can't. I have a bad fin.

00:40:14.455 --> 00:40:17.583
So, Sharkbait, what do you think?

701
00:40:17.666 --> 00:40:18.792
Let's do it!

702
00:40:23.464 --> 00:40:26.592
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Where are you going?

703
00:40:26.675 --> 00:40:29.011
To P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

704
00:40:29.094 --> 00:40:31.388
If you ask where I'm going, I'll tell you.

705
00:40:31.472 --> 00:40:36.810
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Where? I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

706
00:40:36.894 --> 00:40:40.105
Excuse me. Excuse me.

707
00:40:40.189 --> 00:40:42.483
Hi. Do you know how to get... Hello?

708
00:40:42.608 --> 00:40:45.361
Wait. Can you tell me... Hey!

709
00:40:45.444 --> 00:40:46.862
Hold it!

710
00:40:46.946 --> 00:40:48.781
Wait a minute. I'm trying to talk to you.

711
00:40:49.657 --> 00:40:51.533
Okay, fellas. Come back here.

712
00:40:51.617 --> 00:40:55.454
One quick question. I need to...
And they're gone again.

713
00:40:56.455 --> 00:40:58.832
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

714
00:40:58.916 --> 00:41:01.085
Why do I have to tell you again?

715
00:41:01.168 --> 00:41:03.921
- I don't get tired of it.
- All right, here's the thing.

716
00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:09.969
I think it's best
if I carry on from here by...

717
00:41:11.136 --> 00:41:13.430
- By myself.
- Okay.

718
00:41:13.514 --> 00:41:15.057
You know. Alone.

719
00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:20.062
Without... Well, not without you,
but I don't want you with me.

720
00:41:21.772 --> 00:41:24.233
- Huh?
- I don't want to hurt your feelings.

721
00:41:24.316 --> 00:41:27.069
- You want me to leave?
- Well, not... Yes. Yeah.

722
00:41:27.152 --> 00:41:29.697
I just can't afford any more delays.

723
00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:32.658
You're one of
those fish that cause delays.

724
00:41:32.741 --> 00:41:35.786
Sometimes it's a good thing.
There's a group of fish.

725
00:41:35.869 --> 00:41:38.330
- They're delay fish.
- You mean...

726
00:41:39.164 --> 00:41:40.749
You mean you don't like me?

727
00:41:40.833 --> 00:41:42.668
Of course I like you.

728
00:41:42.751 --> 00:41:45.254
Because I like you
I don't want to be with you.

729
00:41:45.337 --> 00:41:47.506
It's a complicated emotion.

730
00:41:48.966 --> 00:41:51.301
Don't cry. I like you.

731
00:41:51.385 --> 00:41:52.469
Hey, you!

732
00:41:53.262 --> 00:41:55.556
Lady, is this guy bothering you?

733
00:41:55.681 --> 00:41:57.766
I don't remember. Were you?

734
00:41:57.850 --> 00:41:59.601
No, no. We're just...

735
00:41:59.685 --> 00:42:01.520
Do you guys know how I can get...

736
00:42:01.645 --> 00:42:05.274
We're talking to the lady, not you.
You like impressions?

737
00:42:05.941 --> 00:42:06.942
Mmm-hmm.

738
00:42:07.026 --> 00:42:09.945
Okay.
Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen.

739
00:42:10.029 --> 00:42:11.739
What are we? Take a guess.

740
00:42:11.822 --> 00:42:12.823
DORY: I've seen one of those.

741
00:42:12.906 --> 00:42:14.867
I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.

742
00:42:14.992 --> 00:42:16.869
- Wait.
- It's a swordfish.

743
00:42:17.036 --> 00:42:19.580
Hey, clown-boy, let the lady guess.

744
00:42:20.289 --> 00:42:21.540
Where's the butter?

745
00:42:22.124 --> 00:42:23.959
- It's on the tip of my tongue.
- Lobster.

746
00:42:24.043 --> 00:42:25.044
- Saw that.
- What?

747
00:42:25.502 --> 00:42:27.546
- Lots of legs.
- Clam?

748
00:42:27.629 --> 00:42:28.839
Close enough.

749
00:42:28.922 --> 00:42:31.383
<i>♪ It's a whale of a tale
I'll tell you, lad ♪</i>

750
00:42:31.467 --> 00:42:33.719
- They're good.
- Somebody give me directions?

751
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:37.639
- "Would somebody give me directions?"
- (DORY LAUGHS)

752
00:42:37.723 --> 00:42:40.017
- I'm serious.
- Blah, blah, me, me.

753
00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:41.560
Blah, blah, blah, me, me.

754
00:42:41.643 --> 00:42:43.228
Thank you.

755
00:42:43.312 --> 00:42:45.522
Oh, dear. Hey, come back.

756
00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.442
What's the matter?

757
00:42:48.525 --> 00:42:50.694
While they're doing impressions,

758
00:42:50.778 --> 00:42:52.279
I am miles from home

759
00:42:52.362 --> 00:42:54.364
with a fish that can't even
remember her own name.

760
00:42:54.615 --> 00:42:55.616
I bet that's frustrating.

761
00:42:55.699 --> 00:42:57.201
My son is out there.

762
00:42:57.326 --> 00:42:59.244
- Your son Chico?
- Nemo.

763
00:42:59.328 --> 00:43:02.998
It doesn't matter. 'Cause no fish
in this ocean is going to help me.

764
00:43:03.082 --> 00:43:04.750
I'm helping you.

765
00:43:06.668 --> 00:43:08.420
Wait right here.

766
00:43:09.713 --> 00:43:11.799
- Guys.
- Is he bothering you again?

767
00:43:11.882 --> 00:43:13.467
No, he's a good guy.

768
00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:15.928
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.

769
00:43:16.011 --> 00:43:18.514
Heard of P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

770
00:43:18.639 --> 00:43:21.016
Sydney? Oh, sure.

771
00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:24.019
Ted here's got relatives in Sydney.
Don't you, Ted?

772
00:43:24.103 --> 00:43:27.439
- Sure do.
- Hey, they know Sydney!

773
00:43:27.523 --> 00:43:28.941
You wouldn't know how to get there?

774
00:43:29.024 --> 00:43:31.151
Follow the EAC.

775
00:43:31.235 --> 00:43:33.862
That's East Australian Current.

776
00:43:33.946 --> 00:43:36.990
Big current. You can't miss it. It's in

777
00:43:37.074 --> 00:43:38.575
that direction.

778
00:43:38.659 --> 00:43:41.161
Then you got to follow that for about...

779
00:43:41.245 --> 00:43:43.997
What do you guys think?
Three leagues?

780
00:43:44.081 --> 00:43:47.167
That baby's going to
float you right past Sydney.

781
00:43:47.251 --> 00:43:48.710
MARLIN: Great! That's great!

782
00:43:48.877 --> 00:43:50.921
- Dory, you did it.
- Oh, please.

783
00:43:51.046 --> 00:43:53.215
I'm just your little helper. Helping along.

784
00:43:53.298 --> 00:43:55.551
- Fellas, thank you.
- Don't mention it.

785
00:43:55.634 --> 00:43:58.095
Just loosen up. Okay, buddy?

786
00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:01.265
You guys! You really nailed him. Bye.

787
00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:02.933
- Ma'am. One more thing.
- Yes?

788
00:44:03.058 --> 00:44:06.603
When you come to this trench,
swim through it, not over it.

789
00:44:06.728 --> 00:44:09.773
Trench. Through it.
Not over it. I'll remember.

790
00:44:09.898 --> 00:44:11.066
Hey!

791
00:44:13.402 --> 00:44:14.736
Wait up, partner. Hold on.

792
00:44:15.487 --> 00:44:18.657
Wait. I've got to tell you something.
Whoa.

793
00:44:20.576 --> 00:44:22.411
Nice trench.

794
00:44:24.788 --> 00:44:26.915
Hello! (ECHO)

795
00:44:30.586 --> 00:44:33.046
- Let's go.
- No, no. Bad trench. Bad trench.

796
00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:34.590
We're going to swim over this thing.

797
00:44:34.673 --> 00:44:37.134
Little red flag going up.

798
00:44:37.259 --> 00:44:40.262
Something's telling me
we should swim through it.

799
00:44:40.345 --> 00:44:43.432
Are you looking at this thing?
It's got death written on it.

800
00:44:43.599 --> 00:44:46.268
I'm sorry, but I think
we should swim through.

801
00:44:46.435 --> 00:44:48.520
I'm done talking about this.
Over we go.

802
00:44:48.604 --> 00:44:50.022
Come on. Trust me on this.

803
00:44:50.105 --> 00:44:52.441
- Trust you?
- Yes. Trust. It's what friends do.

804
00:44:53.442 --> 00:44:55.027
- Something shiny!
- Where?

805
00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:57.863
- It just swam over the trench. Come on.
- Okay.

806
00:45:03.243 --> 00:45:06.038
- Boy, it sure is clear up here.
- Exactly.

807
00:45:06.121 --> 00:45:07.331
And look at that.

808
00:45:07.456 --> 00:45:10.751
There's the current.
We should be there in no time.

809
00:45:11.126 --> 00:45:12.586
Hey, little guy.

810
00:45:12.669 --> 00:45:14.254
You wanted to go through the trench.

811
00:45:14.338 --> 00:45:18.759
I shall call him Squishy and
he shall be mine. Come here, Squishy.

812
00:45:18.842 --> 00:45:20.969
Come here, little Squishy.

813
00:45:21.053 --> 00:45:22.387
(BABY TALK)

814
00:45:22.679 --> 00:45:23.680
Ow!

815
00:45:23.931 --> 00:45:27.017
- That's a jellyfish!
- Bad Squishy.

816
00:45:27.142 --> 00:45:28.477
Shoo! Get away.

817
00:45:28.602 --> 00:45:30.395
- Let me see.
- Don't touch it.

818
00:45:30.479 --> 00:45:32.981
I'm not going to touch it.
I just want to look.

819
00:45:33.106 --> 00:45:34.900
How come it didn't sting you?

820
00:45:34.983 --> 00:45:37.486
It did. Hold still.

821
00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:42.824
I live in this anemone and I'm used to
these kind of stings. Come here.

822
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:44.910
You're going to be fine.

823
00:45:44.993 --> 00:45:48.288
But now we know
that we don't want to touch these again.

824
00:45:48.372 --> 00:45:50.874
Let's be thankful it was just a little one.

825
00:45:54.378 --> 00:45:55.504
Don't move.

826
00:45:57.714 --> 00:45:59.675
This is bad, Dory.

827
00:46:00.509 --> 00:46:02.344
Boing. Boing.

828
00:46:02.803 --> 00:46:03.804
Dory!

829
00:46:04.012 --> 00:46:05.722
You can't catch me.

830
00:46:05.847 --> 00:46:08.433
Don't bounce on the tops. They will

831
00:46:08.517 --> 00:46:10.310
not sting you!

832
00:46:10.435 --> 00:46:13.772
- The tops don't sting you.
- Two in a row. Beat that.

833
00:46:13.855 --> 00:46:15.440
Listen to me. I have an idea.

834
00:46:15.524 --> 00:46:17.359
- A game.
- A game?

835
00:46:17.442 --> 00:46:19.027
I love games. Pick me.

836
00:46:19.194 --> 00:46:23.782
Here's the game. Whoever can hop
the fastest out of these jellyfish wins.

837
00:46:23.865 --> 00:46:25.367
- Okay!
- Rules.

838
00:46:25.492 --> 00:46:27.953
Don't touch the tentacles. Only the tops.

839
00:46:28.036 --> 00:46:31.623
Something about tentacles. Got it.
On your mark. Get set. Go!

840
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.459
Wait!

841
00:46:34.543 --> 00:46:36.628
Go faster if you want to win.

842
00:46:36.712 --> 00:46:39.131
- Dory!
- Boing, boing, boing!

843
00:46:40.048 --> 00:46:42.217
Wait a minute.

844
00:46:42.676 --> 00:46:43.677
Whee!

845
00:46:44.553 --> 00:46:46.388
So, we're cheating death now.

846
00:46:46.471 --> 00:46:49.057
We're having fun at the same time.

847
00:46:49.182 --> 00:46:50.809
I can do this. Just be careful.

848
00:46:50.892 --> 00:46:52.644
Careful I don't make you cry when I win.

849
00:46:52.728 --> 00:46:54.146
I don't think so!

850
00:46:57.399 --> 00:47:00.819
Give it up. You can't fight evolution.
I was built for speed.

851
00:47:00.902 --> 00:47:03.322
- The question is, are you hungry?
- Hungry?

852
00:47:03.405 --> 00:47:05.907
Yeah. 'Cause you're about to
eat my bubbles!

853
00:47:06.575 --> 00:47:09.578
Duck to the left, back
and coming over, right there!

854
00:47:11.663 --> 00:47:14.499
The clownfish is the winner!

855
00:47:14.583 --> 00:47:17.002
We did it. Look at us!

856
00:47:17.085 --> 00:47:18.253
Dory?

857
00:47:20.464 --> 00:47:21.798
Oh, no.

858
00:47:23.133 --> 00:47:25.135
Dory! Dory!

859
00:47:29.848 --> 00:47:30.849
Dory!

860
00:47:31.933 --> 00:47:32.934
(SIZZLING)

861
00:47:33.435 --> 00:47:34.436
Aagghh!

862
00:47:36.813 --> 00:47:38.231
DORY: Am I disqualified?

863
00:47:38.482 --> 00:47:40.567
No, you're, you're actually winning.

864
00:47:40.817 --> 00:47:43.320
But stay awake.
Where does P. Sherman live?

865
00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:46.615
P. Sherman, Wallaby Way, Sydney.

866
00:47:46.865 --> 00:47:48.033
That's it!

867
00:47:50.202 --> 00:47:51.203
Wallaby Way.

868
00:47:51.286 --> 00:47:54.331
Stay awake! Stay awake!

869
00:47:54.581 --> 00:47:55.582
Stay...

870
00:47:55.999 --> 00:47:58.001
...awake!

871
00:48:01.088 --> 00:48:02.089
(WEAKLY) Awake...

872
00:48:02.339 --> 00:48:04.007
P. Sherman...

873
00:48:04.424 --> 00:48:05.425
Awake....

874
00:48:05.509 --> 00:48:07.094
...42 Wallaby Way....

875
00:48:08.011 --> 00:48:09.012
Wake up.

876
00:48:09.679 --> 00:48:11.348
MARLIN: Nemo...

877
00:48:26.029 --> 00:48:28.198
You miss your dad, Sharkbait?

878
00:48:28.448 --> 00:48:29.616
Yeah.

879
00:48:29.866 --> 00:48:33.703
You're lucky to have someone
looking for you.

880
00:48:34.037 --> 00:48:38.375
He's not looking for me.
He's scared of the ocean.

881
00:48:39.626 --> 00:48:40.919
Peach? Any movement?

882
00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:43.797
He's had 4 cups of coffee. It'll be soon.

883
00:48:44.047 --> 00:48:45.257
Keep on him.

884
00:48:48.135 --> 00:48:52.389
My first escape. Landed on dental
tools. I was aiming for the toilet.

885
00:48:52.639 --> 00:48:56.143
- The toilet?
- All drains lead to the ocean, kid.

886
00:48:56.393 --> 00:48:59.688
Wow. How many times
have you tried to get out?

887
00:48:59.771 --> 00:49:00.897
I've lost count.

888
00:49:01.148 --> 00:49:04.484
Fish aren't meant to be in a box.
It does things to you.

889
00:49:04.734 --> 00:49:06.570
Bubbles! Bubbles!

890
00:49:06.945 --> 00:49:10.740
Potty break! He took <i>Reader's Digest.</i>
We have 4.2 minutes.

891
00:49:10.991 --> 00:49:12.451
That's your cue.

892
00:49:12.742 --> 00:49:13.743
You can do it.

893
00:49:13.994 --> 00:49:15.495
Once you get in...

894
00:49:15.745 --> 00:49:20.000
...swim to the bottom of the chamber.
I'll talk you through the rest.

895
00:49:20.417 --> 00:49:23.170
- Go on. It'll be a piece of kelp.
- (TAKES A DEEP BREATH)

896
00:49:31.094 --> 00:49:33.763
- Nicely done! Can you hear me?
- Yeah!

897
00:49:34.055 --> 00:49:35.724
Here comes the pebble!

898
00:49:41.771 --> 00:49:45.650
- Now, do you see a small opening?
- Uh-huh.

899
00:49:45.734 --> 00:49:48.737
Inside it, you'll see a rotating fan.

900
00:49:48.945 --> 00:49:53.283
Very carefully, wedge that pebble
into the fan to stop it turning.

901
00:49:58.163 --> 00:49:59.164
Careful!

902
00:49:59.289 --> 00:50:00.290
I can't do it!

903
00:50:00.582 --> 00:50:01.917
This isn't a good idea.

904
00:50:02.125 --> 00:50:03.752
He'll be fine. Try again.

905
00:50:04.085 --> 00:50:05.462
Okay.

906
00:50:07.005 --> 00:50:09.174
GILL: That's it, Sharkbait.

907
00:50:09.674 --> 00:50:11.676
Nice and steady.

908
00:50:13.929 --> 00:50:15.305
I got it!

909
00:50:16.264 --> 00:50:17.933
- He did it!
- Great, kid!

910
00:50:18.266 --> 00:50:20.352
Now swim up the tube and out.

911
00:50:37.869 --> 00:50:40.288
Oh, no! Gill! Gill!

912
00:50:40.497 --> 00:50:42.999
Sharkbait! Get him out of there!

913
00:50:43.291 --> 00:50:44.793
What do we do?

914
00:50:44.876 --> 00:50:47.337
- Oh, no!
- Stay calm, kid. Just don't panic.

915
00:50:48.672 --> 00:50:49.839
Help me!

916
00:50:50.131 --> 00:50:52.300
Grab hold of this!

917
00:50:55.804 --> 00:50:56.888
No!

918
00:50:56.972 --> 00:50:58.682
- Feed me more!
- That's it!

919
00:50:58.974 --> 00:51:01.226
Come on, Sharkbait, grab it!

920
00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:03.478
Got it!

921
00:51:03.687 --> 00:51:05.021
Pull!

922
00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.656
Gill, don't make him go back in there.

923
00:51:15.991 --> 00:51:17.325
No...

924
00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:19.995
...we're done.

925
00:51:21.997 --> 00:51:23.498
(WHIMPERS)

926
00:51:33.508 --> 00:51:35.176
CRUSH: Dude?

927
00:51:36.428 --> 00:51:37.762
Dude?

928
00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:40.348
Focus, dude.

929
00:51:41.016 --> 00:51:42.350
Dude?

930
00:51:44.185 --> 00:51:45.687
He lives! Hey, dude!

(MARLIN GROANS)

932
00:51:48.189 --> 00:51:49.190
What happened?

933
00:51:49.399 --> 00:51:53.069
I saw the whole thing, dude.
First you were like, whoa!

934
00:51:53.361 --> 00:51:56.239
Then we were like, whoooa!
Then you were like, whooooa.

935
00:51:56.531 --> 00:51:58.199
What are you talking about?

936
00:51:58.450 --> 00:52:01.703
You, mini-man! Taking on the jellies.

937
00:52:02.037 --> 00:52:06.374
You got serious thrill issues, dude.
Awesome.

938
00:52:07.042 --> 00:52:08.710
Oh, my stomach.

939
00:52:09.044 --> 00:52:12.213
No hurling on the shell, okay?
Just waxed it.

940
00:52:13.423 --> 00:52:14.424
So, Mr Turtle...

941
00:52:14.716 --> 00:52:18.386
Whoa, dude. Mr Turtle is my father.
The name's Crush.

942
00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.639
Crush? Really?

943
00:52:21.056 --> 00:52:25.226
Okay, Crush, listen... I need to get
to the East Australian Current.

944
00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:26.728
EAC?

945
00:52:27.479 --> 00:52:28.480
Dude...

946
00:52:28.897 --> 00:52:32.901
You're riding it, dude! Check it out!

947
00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:56.591
Grab shell, dude.

948
00:52:56.925 --> 00:52:58.927
Grab whaaaaaaat?

949
00:53:08.436 --> 00:53:10.355
Righteous! Righteous!

950
00:53:11.106 --> 00:53:12.607
Stop!

951
00:53:15.527 --> 00:53:16.986
So,

952
00:53:17.487 --> 00:53:21.741
what brings you on this fine day
to the EAC?

953
00:53:22.158 --> 00:53:26.162
Well, Dory and I need to get to Sydney.
Dory! Is she all right?

954
00:53:26.413 --> 00:53:27.914
Oh, little blue.

955
00:53:29.249 --> 00:53:30.583
She's sub-level, dude.

956
00:53:34.921 --> 00:53:37.257
Dory, Dory! Dory!

957
00:53:38.007 --> 00:53:39.217
Oh, Dory.

(DORY MUMBLES INCOHERENTLY)

959
00:53:41.761 --> 00:53:43.930
I'm so sorry.

960
00:53:44.264 --> 00:53:46.933
This is all my fault. It's my fault.

...twenty-nine, thirty!
Ready or not, here I come!

- Oh, my goodness!
- Whoa.

967
00:54:20.133 --> 00:54:24.137
Kill the motor, dude.
Let's see what Squirt does flying solo.

968
00:54:33.104 --> 00:54:35.815
Whoa! That was so cool.

969
00:54:35.899 --> 00:54:39.944

Did you see what I did?

You so totally rock, Squirt!

00:54:42.989 --> 00:54:45.658

Offspring, Jellyman.

Totally.

I must have done something
you all liked...dudes.

977

You rock, dude!

978
00:55:02.509 --> 00:55:04.177
Curl away, my son!

979
00:55:04.511 --> 00:55:06.679
It's awesome, Jellyman.

980
00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:10.266
We leave the little dude eggs
on a beach to hatch...

981
00:55:10.517 --> 00:55:14.229
...then, coo-coo-cachoo,
they find their way back to the big blue.

982
00:55:14.437 --> 00:55:16.272
- All by themselves?
- Cha!

983
00:55:16.564 --> 00:55:19.275
But, dude, how do you know
when they're ready?

984
00:55:19.567 --> 00:55:24.072
You never really know, but when
they know, you'll know. You know?

985
00:55:27.075 --> 00:55:28.368
(LAUGHTER)

I know that dude! It's the Jellyman!

Well, go on. Jump on him!

- Turtle pile!
- Wait, kids!

990
00:55:38.086 --> 00:55:39.045
Are you funny?

991
00:55:39.128 --> 00:55:40.922
- Where's your shell?
- Do your stripes come off?

992
00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:42.131
Are you running away?

993
00:55:42.257 --> 00:55:43.633
Did you really cross the jellyfish forest?

994
00:55:43.925 --> 00:55:45.468
- Did they sting you?
- One at a time!

995
00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:47.428
Mr Fish, did you die?

996
00:55:47.637 --> 00:55:49.973
Sorry. I was a little vague on the details.

997
00:55:50.265 --> 00:55:51.307
So where are you going?

998
00:55:51.474 --> 00:55:55.937
Well, you see, my son was taken.
He was taken away from me.

999
00:55:56.312 --> 00:55:58.314
- No way!
- What happened?

1000
00:55:58.606 --> 00:56:01.484
No, kids, I don't want to talk about it.

1001
00:56:03.111 --> 00:56:04.279
Please.

1002
00:56:05.613 --> 00:56:06.698
Well, okay.

1003
00:56:07.282 --> 00:56:10.785
I live on this reef a long,
long way from here.

1004
00:56:10.994 --> 00:56:12.996
This is going to be good.

1005
00:56:13.288 --> 00:56:15.456
And my son, Nemo...

1006
00:56:15.957 --> 00:56:17.792
...he was mad at me.

1007
00:56:18.001 --> 00:56:22.171
Maybe he wouldn't have done it,
if I hadn't been so tough on him.

1008
00:56:22.463 --> 00:56:24.632
Anyway, he swam out to this boat...

1009
00:56:24.841 --> 00:56:29.012
...and these divers appeared. I tried
to stop them, but the boat was too fast.

1010
00:56:29.304 --> 00:56:30.972
So we swam out in the ocean...

1011
00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:34.559
Then Nemo's dad swims out
to the ocean

1012
00:56:34.642 --> 00:56:36.019
and they bump into three ferocious...

1013
00:56:36.311 --> 00:56:39.689
...sharks! He scares them away
by blowing them up!

1014
00:56:39.981 --> 00:56:41.316
Golly, that's amazing!

1015
00:56:41.524 --> 00:56:43.651
He dives thousands of feet down...

1016
00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:46.863
...into the dark. It's wicked dark.

1017
00:56:46.988 --> 00:56:48.323
Hey, Bob.
The only thing they can see...

1018
00:56:48.531 --> 00:56:52.035
...is a light from this horrible creature
with razor-sharp teeth!

1019
00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.328
Nice parry, old man.

1020
00:56:53.536 --> 00:56:54.871
Then he blasts...

1021
00:56:55.163 --> 00:56:57.498
So these two little fish are...
searching the ocean...

1022
00:56:57.624 --> 00:56:59.667
on the East Australian Current...

1023
00:57:00.001 --> 00:57:03.504
...which means that should put him
in Sydney Harbour...

1024
00:57:03.838 --> 00:57:07.175
...in a matter of days!
This guy will stop at nothing...

1025
00:57:07.508 --> 00:57:10.345
...till he finds his son.
I sure hope he does.

1026
00:57:10.678 --> 00:57:13.473
That's one dedicated father
if you ask me.

1027
00:57:20.021 --> 00:57:22.690
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1028
00:57:27.612 --> 00:57:28.613
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1029
00:57:28.696 --> 00:57:32.825
Oh, would you just shut up!
You're rats with wings!

1030
00:57:32.909 --> 00:57:35.203
- This bloke's looking for his boy, Nemo.
- Nemo?

1031
00:57:35.411 --> 00:57:37.080
He was taken by divers, and...

1032
00:57:37.372 --> 00:57:39.374
There, take it! You happy?

1033
00:57:39.832 --> 00:57:42.502
What did you just say about Nemo?

1034
00:57:45.088 --> 00:57:46.422
(GROWLS)

1035
00:57:47.173 --> 00:57:48.174
Mine!

1036
00:57:48.341 --> 00:57:50.343
I hear he's heading for the harbour.

1037
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:52.512
Ho-ho! Brilliant!

1038
00:58:06.567 --> 00:58:07.819
Is he okay?

1039
00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:11.072
I don't know,
but just don't mention D-A-R...

1040
00:58:11.406 --> 00:58:14.409
It's okay.
I know who you're talking about.

1041
00:58:22.667 --> 00:58:23.835
Gill?

1042
00:58:26.421 --> 00:58:27.422
Gill?

1043
00:58:28.756 --> 00:58:30.091
Hey, Sharkbait.

1044
00:58:30.842 --> 00:58:34.595
- I'm sorry I couldn't stop...
- GILL: I'm the one who should be sorry.

1045
00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:40.018
I was so ready to get out.
So ready to taste that ocean.

1046
00:58:40.601 --> 00:58:43.521
I was willing to put you in harm's way
to get there.

1047

Nothing should be worth that.

to your father.

- Aaggh!

Well, that's one way
to pull a tooth. (LAUGHS)

1052

Darn kids. Good thing I pulled
the right one, eh, Prime Minister?

1053

Did he loosen
the periodontal ligament yet?

Where's Nemo?

1057

What is it?

1058
00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:21.934
Your dad's been fighting
the entire ocean looking for you!

1059

My father? Really?

1060
00:59:24.437 --> 00:59:27.774
He's travelled hundreds of miles,
battled sharks and jellyfish...

1061
00:59:28.066 --> 00:59:30.234
Sharks? That can't be him.

1062
00:59:30.568 --> 00:59:33.738
You sure? His name's some sport fish.
Tuna? Trout?

1063
00:59:34.072 --> 00:59:35.156
- Marlin?
- That's it!

My dad took on a shark!

1066

I heard he took on three.

1067
00:59:41.913 --> 00:59:43.581
Three? Three sharks?

1068
00:59:43.831 --> 00:59:45.500
That's 4800 teeth!

1069
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:49.921
After Diver Dan took you,
your dad followed the boat.

1070
00:59:50.171 --> 00:59:52.507
He swims, giving it all he's got...

1071
00:59:52.757 --> 00:59:55.009
...then three huge sharks capture him.

1072
00:59:55.259 --> 00:59:59.764
He blows them up, then gets chased
by a monster with huge teeth!

1073
01:00:00.014 --> 01:00:04.852
He ties the demon to a rock, then gets
to battle an entire jellyfish forest.

1074
01:00:05.103 --> 01:00:08.106
Now he's riding
on the East Australian Current...

1075
01:00:08.356 --> 01:00:11.692

he's headed right now to Sydney!

Darla, your uncle will see you now.

There!

Oh, no. Nemo!

It's okay. Daddy's here.

- Sea turtles...

1582

I met one.

1583
01:30:25.171 --> 01:30:28.966
And he was 150 years old.

1584

150?

1585
01:30:31.093 --> 01:30:32.595
Yep.

1586
01:30:33.262 --> 01:30:37.350
'Cause Sandy Plankton said
they only lived to be 100.

Sandy Plankton?

1588
01:30:39.852 --> 01:30:43.564
Think I would cross the ocean and
not know as much as Sandy Plankton?

1589
01:30:43.773 --> 01:30:46.525
He was 150! Not 100.

1590
01:30:46.609 --> 01:30:49.946
Who is this Sandy Plankton
that knows everything wrong?

Get up! Let's go!

at the mollusk and says,

"With fronds like these,
who needs anemones?"

Well, hello, Nemo. Who's this?
