3
00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:48.676
Will passengers please proceed
to gate number C8?

4
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.821
Hmm.

5
00:07:46.534 --> 00:07:48.069
Hello? This is Tiffany.

6
00:07:49.537 --> 00:07:53.040
Hello?

7
00:08:15.596 --> 00:08:17.732
Bye. <i>Ciao.</i>

8
00:10:15.616 --> 00:10:18.686
No, I'm at the car.

9
00:10:18.786 --> 00:10:21.255
Someone turned up.

10
00:10:21.355 --> 00:10:23.525
No, of course not.

11
00:10:23.624 --> 00:10:26.060
What kind of intel is this, eh?

12
00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:37.738
Yeah, yeah, I'm still here.

13
00:10:39.874 --> 00:10:42.042
No. I'm staying.

14
00:10:42.143 --> 00:10:45.079
Let me know when you need
the package delivered.

15
00:12:12.233 --> 00:12:14.268
There you go.
Thank you very much.

16
00:12:14.368 --> 00:12:16.136
Gracias.

17
00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:43.998
All I do every day
is compromise!

18
00:12:44.098 --> 00:12:47.134
If it's not compromising for
you, it's compromising for him!

19
00:12:47.234 --> 00:12:49.704
My God, I don't even know
who I am anymore!

20
00:12:49.803 --> 00:12:51.438
Can you keep your voice
down?!

21
00:12:51.539 --> 00:12:53.608
No, I won't keep
my voice down!

22
00:12:53.708 --> 00:12:56.745
Jesus Christ!
Don't you dare tell me
to keep my voice down!

23
00:12:56.844 --> 00:12:59.346
I'm sick of you
telling me what to do.

24
00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:01.750
Nobody thinks
about me.

25
00:13:01.849 --> 00:13:03.718
What about me?!

26
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:10.558

Very.

110
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.870
Um, why don't you
put some trunks on?

111
00:23:25.006 --> 00:23:26.439

00:23:56.203 --> 00:23:58.906

Beautiful.

123
00:29:18.459 --> 00:29:20.227
This is new.

124
00:29:23.497 --> 00:29:25.766
I'm trying
to look more like you.

125
00:29:33.274 --> 00:29:34.241
Come here.

126
00:29:35.776 --> 00:29:37.811
Mwah.
Mwah.

127
00:29:37.911 --> 00:29:39.847
Good to see you.

128
00:29:41.915 --> 00:29:43.784
So, why are you here?

129
00:29:46.086 --> 00:29:48.455
Just making sure
everything's in order.

130
00:29:48.556 --> 00:29:50.224
It is.

131
00:29:52.159 --> 00:29:55.029
You sticking around was
a bit of a weird choice.

132
00:29:56.631 --> 00:29:58.566
My job.

133
00:29:58.667 --> 00:30:00.501
I know.

134
00:30:00.602 --> 00:30:02.704
And it's an important one.

135
00:30:02.803 --> 00:30:04.972
They all are.

136
00:30:05.072 --> 00:30:06.840
I don't understand
what it is about this place.

137
00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:10.978
It's just windy,
and it's like Blackpool.

138
00:30:13.881 --> 00:30:15.550
I like it.

139
00:30:18.085 --> 00:30:19.953
Is that why you stayed?

140
00:30:20.054 --> 00:30:21.488
You having a holiday?

141
00:30:27.762 --> 00:30:29.496
Were you born
in that suit?

142
00:30:32.567 --> 00:30:34.301
Classy shirt.

143
00:30:36.805 --> 00:30:38.872
That's what the ladies
say to me.

144
00:30:42.644 --> 00:30:45.112
Lunch?

145
00:30:45.212 --> 00:30:46.514
Yeah.

146
00:30:54.656 --> 00:30:56.290
How's Mum?

147
00:31:00.695 --> 00:31:02.296
She's fine.

148
00:31:04.298 --> 00:31:07.868
Still calls me
every night.

149
00:31:07.968 --> 00:31:10.104
Reminds me to hand in
my bedding.

150
00:31:12.072 --> 00:31:15.275
She's convinced I'm still
in the Paras.

151
00:31:15.376 --> 00:31:19.980
She was so proud of you
in that uniform.

152
00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.015
Your dad
would have been, too.

153
00:31:26.521 --> 00:31:28.723
You never stopped talking
about being a soldier

154
00:31:28.823 --> 00:31:30.725
when you were a kid.

155
00:31:30.825 --> 00:31:32.560
That's what we are,
isn't it?

156
00:31:35.229 --> 00:31:38.465
Private sector --
better pay...

157
00:31:38.566 --> 00:31:40.434
less risks.

158
00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:51.145
We still carry guns,
you know.

159
00:31:53.615 --> 00:31:55.282
Still follow orders.

160
00:31:59.888 --> 00:32:01.556
Not the same.

161
00:32:05.025 --> 00:32:07.529
It's not the same.

162
00:32:07.629 --> 00:32:09.129
Honor.

163
00:32:10.964 --> 00:32:13.200
Dying for queen
and country.

164
00:32:16.571 --> 00:32:20.107
Didn't you and my dad
cover that in the Falklands?

165
00:32:23.745 --> 00:32:25.580
Hmm?

166
00:32:32.286 --> 00:32:34.789
Fuck off!

167
00:32:34.889 --> 00:32:37.424
How does it go?
That thing? The cheers.

168
00:32:37.525 --> 00:32:38.392
"Here's to you...

169
00:32:38.492 --> 00:32:40.427
Here's to us.

170
00:32:40.528 --> 00:32:43.096
Who's like us?"

171
00:32:43.197 --> 00:32:45.999
"Not many.
They're all dead."

172
00:32:49.102 --> 00:32:50.705
Cheers, Dad.

173
00:33:01.616 --> 00:33:03.383
I could get used
to this.

174
00:33:05.486 --> 00:33:07.488
Don't get too used to it,
eh?

175
00:33:12.025 --> 00:33:14.428
You don't like my company?

176
00:33:14.529 --> 00:33:16.296
Hmm?

177
00:33:18.165 --> 00:33:20.467
I could give you a hand
with the job.

178
00:33:24.471 --> 00:33:28.743
Bugger that.
It's <i>your</i> job.

179
00:33:33.581 --> 00:33:35.048
Speaking of which,
the target will be here

180
00:33:35.148 --> 00:33:37.752
in a couple of days,
so...

181
00:33:39.888 --> 00:33:42.022
...get your holiday time in
now.

182
00:33:44.358 --> 00:33:47.394
What do you know
about this crowd, anyway?

183
00:33:48.395 --> 00:33:50.698
I didn't even know that.

184
00:33:56.804 --> 00:33:59.406
Rule number one --

185
00:33:59.507 --> 00:34:02.175
The less you know about
the target, the better.

186
00:34:05.747 --> 00:34:07.481
What's rule number two?

187
00:34:10.685 --> 00:34:12.720
Ryan always pays the bill.

188
00:34:23.698 --> 00:34:25.667
Give my love to Mum, eh?

189
00:34:25.767 --> 00:34:27.167
No.

190
00:34:27.267 --> 00:34:31.371
Mention your name,
she gets all pissed off.

191
00:34:31.471 --> 00:34:35.442
You sure you don't want
to borrow my shirt?

192
00:34:35.543 --> 00:34:37.946
Travel safe, Ryan.

193
00:34:38.046 --> 00:34:39.581
I'll try.

194
00:35:18.418 --> 00:35:20.855
No, it's not you.

195
00:35:20.955 --> 00:35:23.156
No?
No.

196
00:35:23.256 --> 00:35:26.193
You're right.

197
00:35:26.293 --> 00:35:28.161
Went looking for
the <i>American Star</i> today

198
00:35:28.261 --> 00:35:29.496
and couldn't find it.

199
00:35:29.597 --> 00:35:32.967
Really? Maybe you got
the wrong beach.

200
00:35:33.067 --> 00:35:35.469
I think
I'll try again tomorrow.

201
00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:37.739
See you then.

202
00:35:39.272 --> 00:35:40.975
Actually, you know what?
Maybe I can go with you.

203
00:35:41.075 --> 00:35:43.310
I mean, I'd love
to see it again.

204
00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:45.113
I'm busy in the --
in the morning,

205
00:35:45.212 --> 00:35:48.816
but we could go at sunset
if you want.

206
00:35:48.916 --> 00:35:50.718
Which hotel
are you staying at?

207
00:35:50.818 --> 00:35:53.755
Oliva Beach.

208
00:35:53.855 --> 00:35:55.590
I'm Gloria.

209
00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:57.692
Wilson.

210
00:35:57.792 --> 00:35:59.027
Nice to meet you, Wilson.

211
00:35:59.127 --> 00:36:01.395
And you, Gloria.

212
00:36:01.495 --> 00:36:05.566
So, 5:00 p.m.
in the lobby?

213
00:36:05.667 --> 00:36:08.468
Great. See you then.

214
00:36:15.743 --> 00:36:16.978
Hmm.

215
00:36:44.304 --> 00:36:47.041
What's going on
out here?

216
00:36:47.141 --> 00:36:48.843
Nothing.

217
00:36:48.943 --> 00:36:51.378
Your key work?

218
00:36:51.478 --> 00:36:52.914
Yeah.

219
00:36:53.014 --> 00:36:54.649
Oh.

220
00:36:56.517 --> 00:36:58.853
Did you buy
some swimming trunks?

221
00:37:03.791 --> 00:37:06.027
Nope.

222
00:37:06.127 --> 00:37:08.029
Aren't you going to?

223
00:37:08.129 --> 00:37:10.965
Nope.

224
00:37:11.065 --> 00:37:13.201
Why?

225
00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:17.739
Because I have
no intention of taking a dip.

226
00:37:17.839 --> 00:37:20.007
Can't you swim?

227
00:37:20.108 --> 00:37:22.510
Of course I can swim.

228
00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:27.615
And I can parachute jump.

229
00:37:27.715 --> 00:37:29.884
Really?
Mm!

230
00:37:29.984 --> 00:37:33.888
So what -- what are you
doing out here, Max, eh?

231
00:37:33.988 --> 00:37:35.089
My dad.

232
00:37:35.189 --> 00:37:37.725
What?
He snores.

233
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:43.296
Sure does.

234
00:37:43.396 --> 00:37:45.633
Do you snore, too?

235
00:37:45.733 --> 00:37:48.536
Very probably.

236
00:37:48.636 --> 00:37:52.339
Do you really know
how to parachute jump?

237
00:37:52.439 --> 00:37:54.041
I wouldn't lie to you.

238
00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:03.017
You're not gonna spend
all night here, are you?

239
00:38:03.117 --> 00:38:04.886
Just a while longer.

240
00:38:09.322 --> 00:38:11.759
Night-night, Max.

241
00:38:11.859 --> 00:38:13.561
Night.

242
00:38:16.931 --> 00:38:18.298
Hm.

243
00:38:44.025 --> 00:38:45.325
Ah.

244
00:39:28.368 --> 00:39:30.370
Cuatro, cinco...

245
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:33.841
seis, siete, ocho.

246
00:39:36.711 --> 00:39:38.012
iArriba!

247
00:39:38.112 --> 00:39:40.181
Faster! Faster!

248
00:39:40.281 --> 00:39:42.382
Come on!
Faster! Faster!

249
00:39:42.482 --> 00:39:44.151
Hola, Gloria.

250
00:39:44.252 --> 00:39:47.387
Hello.
Perfecto for the beach.

251
00:39:50.324 --> 00:39:52.927
iArriba! IArriba! iArriba!

252
00:39:53.027 --> 00:39:54.295
Do you want to join them?

253
00:39:54.394 --> 00:39:56.864
-Uno, dos...
-Maybe tomorrow.

254
00:39:56.964 --> 00:39:59.100
...tres...
Come on, let's go.

255
00:40:24.892 --> 00:40:28.195
Why Fuerteventura?

256
00:40:28.296 --> 00:40:29.997
Someone suggested it.

257
00:40:33.534 --> 00:40:37.071
Do you always go
on holiday alone?

258
00:40:37.171 --> 00:40:38.873
I like meeting people.

259
00:40:44.011 --> 00:40:47.214
This must be like being
on holiday all year 'round.

260
00:40:47.315 --> 00:40:48.816
Yep. I fucking love it.

261
00:40:52.019 --> 00:40:54.121
Do you mind?
Nope.

262
00:40:54.221 --> 00:40:55.756
You want one?
No. I'm good.

263
00:41:12.106 --> 00:41:13.841
You always lived here?

264
00:41:13.941 --> 00:41:15.943
Eight years.

265
00:41:16.043 --> 00:41:17.144
What made you move here?

266
00:41:17.244 --> 00:41:20.648
My mom. She lives here,
in Puerto del Rosario.

267
00:41:20.748 --> 00:41:22.616
She's a real-estate agent.

268
00:41:22.717 --> 00:41:25.219
Do you want to buy
a holiday home?

269
00:41:25.319 --> 00:41:27.755
Huh?

270
00:41:29.423 --> 00:41:31.025
Dad?

271
00:41:31.125 --> 00:41:32.893
He's around somewhere.

272
00:41:38.232 --> 00:41:39.900
What do you do?

273
00:41:42.169 --> 00:41:44.271
Security.

274
00:41:44.372 --> 00:41:46.107
Alarms?

275
00:41:46.207 --> 00:41:48.376
Personal.

276
00:41:48.476 --> 00:41:49.844
You're a bodyguard?

277
00:41:49.944 --> 00:41:51.979
I deal mainly
with business.

278
00:41:54.915 --> 00:41:58.285
You're from London,
right?

279
00:41:58.386 --> 00:41:59.720
No.
What makes you think that?

280
00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:01.856
Well, because I hear it.
I used to live there.

281
00:42:01.956 --> 00:42:03.024
Oh.
Yeah.

282
00:42:03.224 --> 00:42:04.358
Where?

283
00:42:04.625 --> 00:42:07.528
Wherever they
let me crash for the night.

284
00:42:13.134 --> 00:42:14.835
Are you married?

285
00:42:14.935 --> 00:42:16.404
Divorced.

286
00:42:16.505 --> 00:42:18.672
Kids?

287
00:42:18.773 --> 00:42:21.876
None that I know of.

288
00:42:21.976 --> 00:42:23.878
And you?

289
00:42:23.978 --> 00:42:26.414
I'm like you.
I like meeting people.

290
00:42:58.179 --> 00:42:59.814
Here. Left.

291
00:43:04.852 --> 00:43:05.486
What?

292
00:43:36.283 --> 00:43:38.052
Yes.

293
00:43:38.152 --> 00:43:39.854
Now we walk.

294
00:44:02.544 --> 00:44:03.777
Ah!

295
00:44:23.797 --> 00:44:25.866
How the hell
did it get here?

296
00:44:25.966 --> 00:44:27.636
All right, so basically,

297
00:44:27.735 --> 00:44:29.504
a tugboat was towing it
from Greece to Thailand

298
00:44:29.604 --> 00:44:32.206
to -- to turn it
into a floating hotel.

299
00:44:32.306 --> 00:44:34.375
They were caught in a storm.
The towline snapped.

300
00:44:34.475 --> 00:44:37.111
It ran aground
and broke in two.

301
00:44:37.211 --> 00:44:38.580
When was that?

302
00:44:38.679 --> 00:44:40.314
Early '90s.

303
00:44:40.414 --> 00:44:42.283
They planned to dismantle it
and sell it as scrap.

304
00:44:42.383 --> 00:44:45.986
There was -- There was talk
of taking it to Texas, as well,

305
00:44:46.086 --> 00:44:47.788
to turn it into a prison.

306
00:44:47.888 --> 00:44:49.624
Like the <i>Maidstone.</i>

307
00:44:49.757 --> 00:44:50.891
Ah?

308
00:44:50.991 --> 00:44:53.662
Prison ship in Belfast.

309
00:44:53.761 --> 00:44:56.463
Are you an ex-con?

310
00:44:56.565 --> 00:44:59.066
Why?
Do I look like one?

311
00:45:10.579 --> 00:45:12.079
So the locals looted it.

312
00:45:12.179 --> 00:45:14.381
There's basically bits
of the <i>American Star</i>

313
00:45:14.481 --> 00:45:15.783
all over Fuerteventura.

314
00:45:15.883 --> 00:45:17.418
The currents here
are super strong.

315
00:45:17.519 --> 00:45:19.621
Some people drowned trying
to salvage two grand pianos.

316
00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:21.121
One fell into the sea.

317
00:45:21.222 --> 00:45:22.624
The other one's
in a house near here.

318
00:45:22.756 --> 00:45:23.958
Eleanor Roosevelt
christened it.

319
00:45:24.058 --> 00:45:26.393
The next day,
Hitler invaded Poland.

320
00:45:38.872 --> 00:45:41.308
Not much older than me.

321
00:45:41.408 --> 00:45:44.912
The Yankee Navy painted it gray,
fitted it out with big guns,

322
00:45:45.012 --> 00:45:46.814
and sent it to war.

323
00:45:46.914 --> 00:45:50.251
And that'll be 35 euros,
sir.

324
00:46:28.989 --> 00:46:30.991
Papas arrugadas.

325
00:46:31.091 --> 00:46:33.360
Beer.

326
00:46:35.664 --> 00:46:37.331
<i>Cin cin.</i>

327
00:46:41.302 --> 00:46:43.203
Mmm.

328
00:46:46.974 --> 00:46:50.512
They say there are
three sorts of people

329
00:46:50.612 --> 00:46:52.112
in Fuerteventura.

330
00:46:52.212 --> 00:46:56.785
Those who live here,
tourists,

331
00:46:56.884 --> 00:46:59.253
and those who are running
from something.

332
00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:05.727
I don't live here.

333
00:47:05.826 --> 00:47:07.995
And you don't look
like a tourist.

334
00:47:09.863 --> 00:47:12.534
I'm going to use
the men's room.

335
00:47:43.163 --> 00:47:45.132
"I can see your house
from here."

336
00:47:47.301 --> 00:47:50.371
You don't get it.
There's a language barrier.

337
00:47:50.471 --> 00:47:52.239
Oh, it's a funny joke,
trust me.

338
00:47:52.339 --> 00:47:54.576
See the moon?
Look at the fucking moon.

339
00:47:54.676 --> 00:47:56.110
It's awesome.
Wilson. Come.

340
00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:57.679
What is it?
He's English, like you.

341
00:47:57.779 --> 00:47:58.879
Oh, this is your friend?

342
00:47:58.979 --> 00:48:00.447
Oh, no way. Let me see.

343
00:48:00.548 --> 00:48:03.752
Hey, mate. Nice to meet you.
I'm Ryan. Wilson, is it?

344
00:48:03.852 --> 00:48:05.787
Wilson.
Nice to meet you.

345
00:48:05.886 --> 00:48:07.321
Your friend here,
Gloria,

346
00:48:07.421 --> 00:48:10.023
she was just telling me --
She was trying to teach

347
00:48:10.124 --> 00:48:12.794
my uncivilized ass
how to eat these...

348
00:48:12.893 --> 00:48:13.862
What are they called?

349
00:48:13.961 --> 00:48:15.262
Papas.
Papas?

350
00:48:15.362 --> 00:48:17.965
Arrugadas.
That's the last bit. Arrugas?

351
00:48:18.065 --> 00:48:20.100
Arrugadas.
Got it in one. Nailed it.

352
00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:21.669
And it goes with
this sauce, right?

353
00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:23.705
This is the mo-joe...

354
00:48:23.805 --> 00:48:26.674
Mojo.
Moho. So the mojo is...

355
00:48:26.775 --> 00:48:27.876
Not moho. Mojo.

356
00:48:27.975 --> 00:48:29.878
So Mojo is
the -- the bar?

357
00:48:29.977 --> 00:48:31.145
Mojo is -- Yes.

358
00:48:31.245 --> 00:48:32.747
Named after the blues singer.
Yes.

359
00:48:32.847 --> 00:48:34.883
"Mo-ho" is the sauce...
Mojo is the sauce.

360
00:48:34.982 --> 00:48:36.116
...for the wrinkled things.

361
00:48:36.216 --> 00:48:37.384
Yes.
Got it. You're awesome.

362
00:48:37.484 --> 00:48:38.686
-Good.
-Anyways...

363
00:48:38.787 --> 00:48:40.522
I'm gonna get out
your hair.

364
00:48:40.622 --> 00:48:42.189
I don't want to interrupt you
anymore, but I'm gonna go.

365
00:48:42.289 --> 00:48:43.924
I've got --
My friends are waiting for me.

366
00:48:44.024 --> 00:48:45.159
So they're in Costa Calma
in the south.

367
00:48:45.259 --> 00:48:46.960
Oh, really?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

368
00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:47.961
So I'm staying in the south.
I used to live there.

369
00:48:48.061 --> 00:48:49.531
Actually, yeah.

370
00:48:49.631 --> 00:48:51.432
I can, like, text you
some addresses and...
Mm.

371
00:48:51.533 --> 00:48:53.200
Yeah, that'd be awesome.
...restaurants and stuff.

372
00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:54.769
Yeah, that'd be great.
Yeah, I'd love that.

373
00:48:54.869 --> 00:48:56.303
It was really a pleasure
to meet you.

374
00:48:56.403 --> 00:48:57.806
I'm lucky I met you here.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

375
00:48:57.906 --> 00:48:59.006
All right, take it easy.
All right.

376
00:48:59.106 --> 00:49:00.575
Put a coat on.
You look cold.

377
00:49:00.675 --> 00:49:03.277
Take it easy, Wilson.
Nice to meet you, mate.

378
00:49:03.377 --> 00:49:04.445
Papas arrugadas!

379
00:49:04.546 --> 00:49:07.481
Yes!

380
00:49:07.582 --> 00:49:09.416
He's nice.
Huh?

381
00:49:27.167 --> 00:49:30.805
Yeah. Honestly,
it felt like a miracle.

382
00:49:30.905 --> 00:49:32.406
What?

383
00:49:32.507 --> 00:49:36.276
Well, us being there just
at the moment the ship moved.

384
00:49:36.376 --> 00:49:37.712
Oh.

385
00:49:37.812 --> 00:49:42.216
It's as if it was waiting
for someone to be watching.

386
00:49:42.316 --> 00:49:44.218
Maybe tonight,
it will sink completely.

387
00:49:44.318 --> 00:49:45.687
That will make us
the last two people

388
00:49:45.787 --> 00:49:48.523
ever to see
the <i>American Star.</i>

389
00:49:48.623 --> 00:49:50.023
Mm.

390
00:49:56.129 --> 00:49:57.866
My mom loves this song.

391
00:49:57.966 --> 00:49:59.366
Mm.

392
00:50:07.474 --> 00:50:09.476
It's Julio.

393
00:50:21.355 --> 00:50:23.691
What's the name of it?

394
00:50:23.791 --> 00:50:27.027
"Me Olvidé de Vivir."

395
00:50:27.127 --> 00:50:29.597
"Me Olvidé de Vivir"?

396
00:50:29.697 --> 00:50:31.799
In English?

397
00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:33.768
"I Forgot about Living."

398
00:50:33.868 --> 00:50:35.435
Mm.

399
00:50:45.847 --> 00:50:47.515
It's about man
who doesn't know

400
00:50:47.615 --> 00:50:49.383
what he feels anymore.

401
00:50:54.321 --> 00:50:58.125
Look at the stars.
Look.

402
00:50:58.225 --> 00:51:00.828
Kill the headlights.

403
00:51:00.929 --> 00:51:02.530
Turn them off.

00:51:19.948 --> 00:51:23.585

Thank you.

409
00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:02.924
See you at
the bar later?

410
00:52:03.024 --> 00:52:04.859
It's been a long day.

411
00:52:04.959 --> 00:52:07.095
All right.

412
00:52:07.862 --> 00:52:11.766
Actually, my mom's
coming for lunch tomorrow.

413
00:52:11.866 --> 00:52:14.134
Do you want to join us?

414
00:52:14.234 --> 00:52:16.403
Don't you think you should
check with mom first?

415
00:52:16.504 --> 00:52:18.906
Well, she's like us.
She likes meeting people.

416
00:52:19.007 --> 00:52:21.075
1:30 tomorrow.

417
00:52:21.174 --> 00:52:23.243
Sure.

418
00:52:43.965 --> 00:52:46.668
Where are you?

419
00:52:46.768 --> 00:52:50.605

So what was that all
about today?

426
00:53:10.925 --> 00:53:13.661
I'm following orders.

427
00:53:13.761 --> 00:53:16.564
I've been told to stay
on the island.

428
00:53:16.664 --> 00:53:18.465
I work alone.

429
00:53:24.304 --> 00:53:27.075
Just think of me as the wind
beneath your wings.

430
00:53:27.175 --> 00:53:30.111
I don't need you, Ryan.

431
00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:32.513
Don't shoot
the messenger, mate.

432
00:53:32.613 --> 00:53:35.083
If you got a problem with them,
take it up with them.

433
00:53:35.183 --> 00:53:37.284
Knock yourself out.

434
00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:40.287
Good news though.

435
00:53:40.387 --> 00:53:41.622
Got another job
for you in two weeks.

436
00:53:41.723 --> 00:53:44.659
I'd rather finish
this one first.

437
00:53:53.366 --> 00:53:56.871
Everything is fine,
right?

438
00:53:56.971 --> 00:53:58.740
Of course it is.

439
00:54:04.145 --> 00:54:06.714
Gloria is lovely,
by the way.

440
00:54:06.814 --> 00:54:07.982
She's a bit skinny,

441
00:54:08.082 --> 00:54:09.449
but she's got
really nice tits.

442
00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:10.952
Now don't worry.
I'm not trying

443
00:54:11.052 --> 00:54:12.720
to tread on
your turf, uncle.

444
00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:14.622
I would never do that.

445
00:54:26.801 --> 00:54:29.003
It's my mom.

446
00:54:31.371 --> 00:54:33.040
Stay in the south, right?

447
00:54:36.677 --> 00:54:38.813
Hiya, mum.

448
00:54:41.348 --> 00:54:45.086
Yeah, if you change it
to region two,

449
00:54:45.186 --> 00:54:48.388
it'll start working
no problem.

450
00:54:48.488 --> 00:54:50.390
Yeah, it's
the DVD region.

Good morning, Max.

455
00:55:43.343 --> 00:55:46.113
I found one of your toy soldiers
in the corridor.

456
00:55:46.214 --> 00:55:48.549
Remind me to give
you it back later.

457
00:55:49.784 --> 00:55:51.853
Okay.

458
00:56:08.803 --> 00:56:11.806
What's with
that shirt, eh?

459
00:56:11.906 --> 00:56:14.108
Real Madrid.

460
00:56:14.208 --> 00:56:17.311
Yeah, I can see that.

461
00:56:17.410 --> 00:56:19.981
Where are you from?
Madrid?

462
00:56:20.081 --> 00:56:21.349
Cardiff.

463
00:56:21.448 --> 00:56:23.251
Cardiff.

464
00:56:23.351 --> 00:56:25.253
So why isn't your
favorite team Cardiff?

465
00:56:25.353 --> 00:56:26.787
I mean, you know,
where you were born,

466
00:56:26.888 --> 00:56:29.190
your hometown team,
or some other Welsh team?

467
00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:31.192
Swansea maybe,
I don't know.

468
00:56:31.292 --> 00:56:35.162
They haven't won
any Champions Leagues.

469
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:37.331
Well, how about
Liverpool then?

470
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:38.900
They're nearly Welsh.

471
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.070
How many Champions Leagues
have they won?

472
00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:45.106
Six?

473
00:56:46.207 --> 00:56:48.175
Real Madrid, 13.

474
00:56:50.477 --> 00:56:54.248
How many can you do without
it touching the ground?

475
00:56:54.348 --> 00:56:58.619
Oh, you want me
to play keepy up, huh?

476
00:56:59.921 --> 00:57:03.291
How many you think I can do
without dropping it?

477
00:57:03.391 --> 00:57:05.192
Don't know.

478
00:57:07.494 --> 00:57:09.163
All right.

479
00:57:09.263 --> 00:57:11.699
Let's have a bet, then.

480
00:57:11.799 --> 00:57:15.002
I'll bet you
I can do 20.

481
00:57:16.203 --> 00:57:18.239
Alright?
For the ball.

482
00:57:18.339 --> 00:57:21.142
If I don't,
I'll give you 20 euros.

483
00:57:21.242 --> 00:57:22.944
Just a sec. Wait.

484
00:57:25.046 --> 00:57:26.814
There you go.

485
00:57:29.684 --> 00:57:32.887
30 euros, 20 kicks.

486
00:57:33.287 --> 00:57:36.223
30 euros, 20 kicks.

487
00:57:36.324 --> 00:57:38.125
There's 20.

488
00:57:40.928 --> 00:57:42.495
And there's 10.

489
00:57:42.596 --> 00:57:45.533
30, right? Okay.

490
00:57:47.902 --> 00:57:50.871
It's been a while.
Move back a bit.

491
00:57:50.972 --> 00:57:52.807
Okay.

492
00:57:52.907 --> 00:57:55.876
Now you get best of three.
All right?

493
00:57:55.977 --> 00:57:58.646
One, two, three...

494
00:57:58.746 --> 00:58:01.215
14, 15, 16...

495
00:58:01.315 --> 00:58:02.583
One, two...

496
00:58:02.683 --> 00:58:05.052
One more.
I get one more go!

497
00:58:05.152 --> 00:58:06.954
Oh!

498
00:58:07.054 --> 00:58:08.356
Here we go.

499
00:58:08.456 --> 00:58:10.358
Three...

500
00:58:10.458 --> 00:58:11.491
Two...

501
00:58:11.592 --> 00:58:13.928
No!

502
00:58:14.562 --> 00:58:16.664
Okay. You win.

503
00:58:20.534 --> 00:58:22.536
Oh.

504
00:58:27.341 --> 00:58:30.244
Can you
really parachute?

505
00:58:30.344 --> 00:58:33.381
Come here.

506
00:58:33.481 --> 00:58:35.216
Look.

507
00:58:36.617 --> 00:58:38.819
I want to learn, too.

508
00:58:38.919 --> 00:58:40.888
Well, you're a bit young.

509
00:58:40.988 --> 00:58:44.458
Well, how old were you
when you learned?

510
00:58:44.592 --> 00:58:46.427
19.

511
00:58:46.527 --> 00:58:48.362
Weren't you scared?

512
00:58:48.462 --> 00:58:50.998
I was terrified
the first time,

513
00:58:51.098 --> 00:58:53.567
and I couldn't wait
to go back up

514
00:58:53.667 --> 00:58:57.805
and back up
and back up again.

515
00:58:57.905 --> 00:59:00.207
All right. Off you go.
Off you go.

516
00:59:00.307 --> 00:59:01.642
Unless you want
another bet.

517
00:59:01.742 --> 00:59:04.712
No? No. All right.

518
00:59:04.812 --> 00:59:07.148
Go on. Your mother's
calling you somewhere.

519
00:59:07.248 --> 00:59:09.150
See you later, Max.

520
01:01:41.001 --> 01:01:42.770
Hola?

521
01:02:16.737 --> 01:02:19.273
That's Gloria.

522
01:02:19.373 --> 01:02:22.776
All those other photos
were taken by her.

523
01:02:24.579 --> 01:02:26.648
She doesn't like smoking
in the house.

524
01:02:28.782 --> 01:02:31.852
My name is Anne.

525
01:02:31.952 --> 01:02:35.523
I'm pleased
to meet you, Anne.

526
01:02:35.624 --> 01:02:37.424
Wilson, isn't it?

527
01:02:37.525 --> 01:02:38.727
Mm-hmm.

528
01:02:38.826 --> 01:02:40.528
Gloria just went out
for shopping.

529
01:02:40.629 --> 01:02:42.763
She will be back
in a minute.

530
01:02:42.863 --> 01:02:44.532
Fancy a drink?

531
01:02:44.633 --> 01:02:46.534
Well, I brought
some wine.

532
01:02:46.635 --> 01:02:48.802
Ah.
Merci.

533
01:02:48.902 --> 01:02:52.641
And the flowers
are for you.

534
01:02:52.741 --> 01:02:54.875
Mm.

535
01:02:57.411 --> 01:03:00.749
We will put it in
the fridge, shall we?

536
01:03:00.848 --> 01:03:04.318
I'm having a beer.
Want one?

537
01:03:04.418 --> 01:03:06.521
Sure.

538
01:03:06.621 --> 01:03:08.822
Please have a seat.

539
01:03:39.086 --> 01:03:41.589
Gloria tells me that you
are thinking of buying

540
01:03:41.690 --> 01:03:43.457
a house on the island.

541
01:03:45.092 --> 01:03:47.394
It's a fabulous place.

542
01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:53.267
I've been here
for almost 15 years.

543
01:03:53.367 --> 01:03:56.403
I wouldn't change it
for the world.

544
01:03:56.503 --> 01:03:58.339
I'll bet.

545
01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:05.680
You are in security?

546
01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:07.615
Yes.

547
01:04:11.852 --> 01:04:13.854
I have been.

548
01:04:15.456 --> 01:04:18.359
Ex-military.

549
01:04:18.459 --> 01:04:20.562
Is it that obvious?

550
01:04:23.364 --> 01:04:28.703
My father was a colonel
and a full man, violence.

551
01:04:28.803 --> 01:04:31.138
We never got on.

552
01:04:33.775 --> 01:04:37.211
Do you have children?

553
01:04:37.311 --> 01:04:39.079
No.

554
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:44.885
How long are you planning
to stay?

555
01:04:44.985 --> 01:04:49.089
Oh, just a few days.
This is a short holiday.

556
01:04:54.696 --> 01:05:00.234
Gloria doesn't usually
introduce me to her friends.

557
01:05:02.236 --> 01:05:05.939
You must have made
a big impression.

558
01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:12.847
She took you
to see that ship?

559
01:05:12.946 --> 01:05:14.415
Oh, the <i>American Star.</i>

560
01:05:14.516 --> 01:05:15.784
Mm-hmm.

561
01:05:15.884 --> 01:05:18.452
It's only
a heap of scrap metal,

562
01:05:18.553 --> 01:05:24.592
but Gloria's always
found it fascinating.

563
01:05:29.631 --> 01:05:35.068
Gloria hasn't realized yet,
but the reason of her interest

564
01:05:35.169 --> 01:05:40.040
in you is that you remind
her of her father.

565
01:05:42.075 --> 01:05:46.246
So he's a military
man, too?

566
01:05:46.346 --> 01:05:48.382
No.

567
01:05:50.652 --> 01:05:56.123
And it's not that you look
like him either.

568
01:05:59.126 --> 01:06:02.062
Well, whatever
it is, Anne...

569
01:06:03.197 --> 01:06:06.266
...I'll take it
as a compliment.

570
01:06:09.804 --> 01:06:11.806
Maman?

571
01:06:11.906 --> 01:06:13.741
Bonjour, mon cherie.

572
01:06:15.209 --> 01:06:19.112
There you are,
drinking your beer.

573
01:06:21.683 --> 01:06:23.283
Okay.

574
01:06:34.762 --> 01:06:36.664
If you wanted to be on your own
with our guest,

575
01:06:36.764 --> 01:06:38.098
you should have
just told me.

576
01:06:38.198 --> 01:06:41.736
I was trying
to sell him a house.

577
01:06:41.836 --> 01:06:44.204
Wilson,
grab some wine.

578
01:06:55.783 --> 01:06:57.785
So what's she
been saying?

579
01:06:59.621 --> 01:07:01.421
Nothing.

580
01:07:04.124 --> 01:07:06.260
Really.

581
01:07:07.127 --> 01:07:10.698
Lunch is ready.
Voilà.

582
01:07:14.669 --> 01:07:15.870
May I?

583
01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:18.338
No, black's fine.
Thank you.

584
01:07:18.438 --> 01:07:20.875
Do you want?

585
01:07:20.975 --> 01:07:24.044

619

Just promise me
one thing.

620
01:09:48.723 --> 01:09:50.357
Yes?

621
01:09:50.457 --> 01:09:54.028
You'll buy yourself
a new bike, Mademoiselle.

622
01:09:54.128 --> 01:09:55.930
I promise.

623
01:10:00.134 --> 01:10:02.103
It was nice having you
for lunch today.

624
01:10:02.202 --> 01:10:06.473
It was delicious
and interesting.

625
01:10:08.308 --> 01:10:10.210
You make a nice couple.

626
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:14.716
With all respect, I don't
think I'm your mom's type.

627
01:10:14.816 --> 01:10:15.917
Nobody is.

628
01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:27.662
When are you leaving?

629
01:10:27.762 --> 01:10:29.564
A couple of days.

630
01:10:51.886 --> 01:10:54.555
Come and say goodbye
before leaving, okay?

631
01:12:20.107 --> 01:12:21.408
What the fuck are you doing?

632
01:12:21.509 --> 01:12:23.110
Are you deaf?
Why are you tracking me?

633
01:12:23.211 --> 01:12:25.279
Tracking you?
I'm tracking her.

634
01:12:25.378 --> 01:12:26.981
Fucking knows
the target.

635
01:12:27.081 --> 01:12:28.415
Here, read that.

636
01:12:28.516 --> 01:12:29.684
You know, the one
you're involved with?

637
01:12:29.784 --> 01:12:31.285
I'm not involved
with anybody.

638
01:12:31.384 --> 01:12:33.287
Don't fucking lie to me!
Read that.

639
01:12:33.386 --> 01:12:35.823
That's for you.
It's your fucking present.

640
01:12:35.923 --> 01:12:37.390
Fucking hell.

641
01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:39.260
You went to a bar.
You went to the beach with her.

642
01:12:39.392 --> 01:12:41.428
You watched her swim.

643
01:12:41.529 --> 01:12:44.298
You went and had lunch
with her mum.

644
01:12:44.397 --> 01:12:47.268
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

645
01:12:47.367 --> 01:12:48.803
Read that.
Two years in Holloway.

646
01:12:48.903 --> 01:12:50.805
A year in a French prison.
A year on probation.

647
01:12:50.905 --> 01:12:54.175
Shagging a fucking
drug dealer.

648
01:12:54.275 --> 01:12:55.910
She's fucking
Pablo Escobar.

649
01:12:56.010 --> 01:12:58.445
And you're driving around
with her in your fucking car!

650
01:12:58.546 --> 01:13:00.248
Rule number one!

651
01:13:00.348 --> 01:13:03.150
Fucking hell!

652
01:13:03.251 --> 01:13:04.484
Anybody else
know about this?

653
01:13:04.585 --> 01:13:06.386
Yeah, yeah,
I've told everyone.

654
01:13:06.486 --> 01:13:08.289
What do you think?

655
01:13:08.388 --> 01:13:11.225
You trust me?

656
01:13:11.325 --> 01:13:14.195
Fucking hell.

657
01:13:14.295 --> 01:13:17.131
I always trust you.

658
01:13:17.231 --> 01:13:18.833
I'll finish this job.

659
01:13:18.933 --> 01:13:23.436
I'll call you when it's over,
and we can both go home.

660
01:14:36.444 --> 01:14:38.813
Hello, Max.

661
01:14:38.913 --> 01:14:42.583
My dad says I've got
to give you the money back.

662
01:14:45.219 --> 01:14:46.721
You told him?

663
01:14:46.821 --> 01:14:49.991
My mother found it
in my trousers.

664
01:14:50.091 --> 01:14:55.096
Oh, you should have said
that you found it on the beach.

665
01:14:58.299 --> 01:15:00.868
Max.

666
01:15:00.968 --> 01:15:03.404
You know when Mom and Dad
tell you

667
01:15:03.503 --> 01:15:06.540
that you must never tell lies?

668
01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:09.110
Sometimes you have to.

669
01:15:09.210 --> 01:15:12.580
Sometimes you have to lie
to whoever it is,

670
01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:14.448
your friend, your best
friend, your girlfriend,

671
01:15:14.548 --> 01:15:20.187
your wife, your teacher,
even your mom and dad.

672
01:15:20.287 --> 01:15:21.522
For your own good.

673
01:15:21.622 --> 01:15:23.024
You won that money
fair and square.

674
01:15:23.124 --> 01:15:27.261
You win those 30 euros.
We had a bet. I lost.

675
01:15:27.361 --> 01:15:30.398
You lose, you pay up.

676
01:15:30.498 --> 01:15:33.000
You win, you collect.

677
01:15:34.101 --> 01:15:35.736
Fact of life.

678
01:15:35.836 --> 01:15:38.072
All right? All right.

679
01:15:38.172 --> 01:15:42.176
Now, when were you supposed
to give me this money?

680
01:15:43.512 --> 01:15:45.246
At breakfast.

681
01:15:45.346 --> 01:15:47.548
Oh.
We're leaving tomorrow.

682
01:15:47.648 --> 01:15:50.584
Oh, Maxie.

683
01:15:50.684 --> 01:15:52.987
I'm sorry. We're just
getting to know each other.

684
01:15:53.087 --> 01:15:58.459
Anyway, there's 10 euros.
There's 20 euros.

685
01:15:58.893 --> 01:16:02.396
Come on.
And there's 30 euros.

686
01:16:02.496 --> 01:16:08.002
Hide them in a better place
than you did last time, okay?

687
01:16:08.102 --> 01:16:10.304
Good.

688
01:16:10.404 --> 01:16:12.239
Hang on a minute.

689
01:16:14.175 --> 01:16:17.278
Don't move.
Stay right where you are.

690
01:16:18.913 --> 01:16:21.582
I'll be right back.
Okay?

691
01:16:37.932 --> 01:16:39.900
Ta-da!

692
01:16:46.874 --> 01:16:48.476
Does it really fly?

693
01:16:48.577 --> 01:16:51.712
It will if you launch it
from a high point.

694
01:16:54.583 --> 01:16:55.616
Come on.

695
01:16:55.716 --> 01:16:56.917
What?
Where are we going?

696
01:16:57.017 --> 01:17:02.623
Come on! Come!
Come on!

697
01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:08.028
Come!

698
01:17:10.131 --> 01:17:11.899
Come on!

699
01:17:13.934 --> 01:17:17.304
It's a good place, Max.

700
01:17:17.404 --> 01:17:19.508
Who showed it you?

701
01:17:19.608 --> 01:17:21.775
No one.

702
01:17:22.409 --> 01:17:24.613
Here.

703
01:17:24.712 --> 01:17:26.814
It's yours.
You're gonna throw it.

704
01:17:26.914 --> 01:17:30.050
You want to be a paratrooper
one day, don't you?

705
01:17:30.151 --> 01:17:32.521
So go for it, Tom.

706
01:17:32.621 --> 01:17:34.955
You mean Max.

707
01:17:35.055 --> 01:17:37.658
I know it's Max,
but we call every newcomer

708
01:17:37.758 --> 01:17:40.060
in the regiment Tom.

709
01:17:44.331 --> 01:17:46.700
I'm gonna help you, okay?

710
01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:50.572
It's all right.
Come here.

711
01:17:50.671 --> 01:17:52.940
Come on, Maxie.

712
01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:56.043
The thing to remember,
Max, is this.

713
01:17:57.311 --> 01:18:00.881
That every soldier should be
willing to lay his life

714
01:18:00.981 --> 01:18:03.951
on the line
for another soldier.

715
01:18:04.051 --> 01:18:08.289
Vice versa. I guess that's
the best lesson to remember, hm?

716
01:18:08.389 --> 01:18:09.690
So do you trust me?

717
01:18:09.790 --> 01:18:12.059
Yeah.
Good.

718
01:18:12.159 --> 01:18:15.129
I'm gonna get
hold of you, okay?

719
01:18:17.031 --> 01:18:20.467
There you go.
I got ya. Look at me here.

720
01:18:20.569 --> 01:18:22.369
Now look down.
Don't be scared.

721
01:18:22.469 --> 01:18:25.674
See? Now, when
I say "now" --

722
01:18:25.773 --> 01:18:28.643
Look down. I've got hold of you.
It's all right.

723
01:18:28.742 --> 01:18:30.211
You want to be
a paratrooper, don't you?

724
01:18:30.311 --> 01:18:33.347
Alright, now,
put your right hand back.

725
01:18:33.447 --> 01:18:35.282
Right, when I say "now",

726
01:18:35.382 --> 01:18:39.019
I want you to throw that
out there as hard and as fast

727
01:18:39.119 --> 01:18:41.523
and as far as you can.
Ready?

728
01:18:41.623 --> 01:18:43.891
You ready?
Put your arm back.

729
01:18:43.991 --> 01:18:47.861
One. Two. Three. Now!

730
01:18:47.962 --> 01:18:50.364
Yeah. Look over there.

731
01:18:58.272 --> 01:19:00.474
Look.

732
01:19:52.761 --> 01:19:55.429
Need a lift?

733
01:19:55.530 --> 01:19:59.300
Well, what I need
is a new bike, as you said.

734
01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:02.002
Oh, actually,
I have to drop some some stuff

735
01:20:02.102 --> 01:20:03.605
at my mom's client.

736
01:20:03.705 --> 01:20:05.272
Can you take me there?
Sure. Hop in.

737
01:20:05.372 --> 01:20:07.174
Yeah?

738
01:20:17.652 --> 01:20:19.920
That's a nice surprise.

739
01:20:37.271 --> 01:20:40.307
Nice, huh?
Shall we go inside?

740
01:20:40.407 --> 01:20:41.909
No, I'll wait.

741
01:20:42.009 --> 01:20:44.411
All right,
I'll be five seconds.

742
01:20:48.516 --> 01:20:52.219
And then after, let's take
a dip in the ocean.

743
01:20:53.755 --> 01:20:55.523
Sure.

744
01:21:40.934 --> 01:21:42.503
Whoo!

745
01:21:42.604 --> 01:21:44.972
Whoo-hoo!

746
01:21:46.808 --> 01:21:49.677
Oh, it's so nice.

747
01:21:49.778 --> 01:21:53.715
Let's -- Let's take a quick dip.

748
01:21:53.815 --> 01:21:55.550
Huh?

749
01:21:55.650 --> 01:22:02.524
Allez Wilson! Allez Wilson!
Allez Wilson! Whoo-hoo!

750
01:22:08.462 --> 01:22:11.331
Whoo-hoo!

751
01:22:11.432 --> 01:22:13.066
Whoo!

752
01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:15.202
Allez!

753
01:23:58.071 --> 01:24:00.675
What, were you gonna do,
abandon me here?

754
01:24:04.111 --> 01:24:06.079
Are you okay?
What's wrong?

755
01:24:06.948 --> 01:24:09.349
I just want
to get out of here.

756
01:24:09.449 --> 01:24:11.753
Why don't you
take a dip?

757
01:24:11.853 --> 01:24:15.389
Last time I took a dip
in the ocean was 30 years ago.

758
01:24:15.489 --> 01:24:17.291
How come?

759
01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:22.462
I watched my best friend
die in it.

760
01:24:25.533 --> 01:24:28.335
So are you getting in
or what?

761
01:25:04.706 --> 01:25:06.808
He drowned?

762
01:25:06.908 --> 01:25:08.843
Hypothermia.

763
01:25:08.943 --> 01:25:11.345
What happened?

764
01:25:11.445 --> 01:25:13.113
A war.

765
01:25:13.213 --> 01:25:15.583
A war? What war?

766
01:25:15.683 --> 01:25:17.885
The Falklands.

767
01:25:17.986 --> 01:25:19.721
You were in
the Falklands?

768
01:25:19.821 --> 01:25:21.756
Yep.

769
01:25:23.024 --> 01:25:26.226
So no ocean for me
since then.

770
01:25:31.532 --> 01:25:35.003
Tell me about
London, Gloria.

771
01:25:35.103 --> 01:25:37.337
What were
you doing there?

772
01:25:40.541 --> 01:25:43.210
What?
Will you tell me about it?

773
01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:45.312
You don't remember?

774
01:25:45.412 --> 01:25:47.347
Huh?

775
01:25:49.483 --> 01:25:53.054
Maybe this will
help your memory. Huh?

776
01:25:53.153 --> 01:25:55.155
Have a look.

777
01:25:59.159 --> 01:26:02.030
It's you, isn't it?

778
01:26:02.130 --> 01:26:05.198
How was Holloway?
Nice?

779
01:26:05.298 --> 01:26:08.402
Then a French prison?
Ooh, the fucking lie.

780
01:26:08.502 --> 01:26:10.470
Now your heading straight
for a Spanish nick

781
01:26:10.571 --> 01:26:14.108
unless you change
your lifestyle.

782
01:26:14.207 --> 01:26:16.309
Anything to say,
Gloria?

783
01:26:18.112 --> 01:26:20.682
All right,
just stop the car.

784
01:26:20.782 --> 01:26:23.216
Stop the fucking car!

785
01:26:23.316 --> 01:26:26.054
Stop the car right now!

786
01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:28.656
Stop the car!
Or I jump!

787
01:26:28.756 --> 01:26:30.091
Don't be silly.

788
01:26:30.190 --> 01:26:31.693
Aaah!

789
01:26:51.378 --> 01:26:53.948
Where's my fucking
phone now?

790
01:26:54.048 --> 01:26:55.215
Get the fuck
out of here!

791
01:26:55.315 --> 01:26:56.751
Just go.
Just...

792
01:26:56.851 --> 01:26:58.886
Leave!
Fuck you!

793
01:26:58.986 --> 01:27:00.888
Motherfucker!
Piece of shit!

794
01:27:00.988 --> 01:27:02.590
Get off the island!

795
01:27:04.224 --> 01:27:05.860
You never saw me!

796
01:27:08.129 --> 01:27:10.698
I was never here!

797
01:27:10.798 --> 01:27:13.935
You motherfucker!
Piece of shit!

798
01:27:15.169 --> 01:27:19.272
I fucking, fucking,
fucking trusted you!

799
01:27:19.372 --> 01:27:22.176
You're fucking
with my mom!

800
01:27:22.810 --> 01:27:27.014
You know what?
I don't fucking need anyone!

801
01:27:27.115 --> 01:27:29.517
I don't fucking need
no one!

802
01:30:07.842 --> 01:30:09.277
You want to
drink something?

803
01:30:09.377 --> 01:30:11.145
Yeah.
Okay.

804
01:30:28.896 --> 01:30:31.498
Is it yours?

805
01:30:52.119 --> 01:30:54.121
Okay?

806
01:30:55.656 --> 01:31:00.027
Can you check if we have
some lemon, please?

807
01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:00.888
Wait.
Yeah.

808
01:32:23.444 --> 01:32:25.212
Thomas?

809
01:32:29.116 --> 01:32:30.551
Thomas?

810
01:32:30.651 --> 01:32:33.320
Thomas?

811
01:32:38.459 --> 01:32:42.196
I told you
to leave the island.

812
01:32:42.296 --> 01:32:46.133
Go now.
There's still time.

813
01:33:34.448 --> 01:33:36.350
Gloria!

814
01:33:36.450 --> 01:33:38.285
Gloria!

815
01:33:43.558 --> 01:33:46.360
Can you finish her?
I'll do him.

816
01:33:56.270 --> 01:33:57.371
Oh.

817
01:33:57.471 --> 01:34:00.609
Gloria, look at me.

818
01:34:00.708 --> 01:34:02.409
Look at me.

819
01:34:05.079 --> 01:34:06.347
Look at me.

820
01:34:06.447 --> 01:34:08.315
Okay, okay.

821
01:34:08.415 --> 01:34:11.452
I'll be all right.

822
01:34:19.093 --> 01:34:21.195
Look at me.

823
01:34:21.530 --> 01:34:23.565
Goodbye, Gloria.

824
01:34:33.073 --> 01:34:35.976
It's okay.

825
01:34:36.877 --> 01:34:38.846
It's all right.

826
01:34:40.848 --> 01:34:44.118
No, no.
You'll be fine.

827
01:34:45.052 --> 01:34:47.154
Just...

828
01:34:47.254 --> 01:34:49.990
let go.

829
01:35:55.289 --> 01:35:56.824
Hiya, Mum.

830
01:35:58.492 --> 01:36:02.096
Yeah. No, I'm a bit busy
at the minute. Can I --

831
01:36:02.196 --> 01:36:05.533
Yeah. I'm still out here.
Yeah, it's lovely weather.

832
01:36:05.634 --> 01:36:07.736
Yeah.

833
01:36:07.835 --> 01:36:10.971
Well, it's mostly
rocks and desert, to be fair.

834
01:36:21.650 --> 01:36:24.151
Uncle sends his love.

835
01:36:26.554 --> 01:36:30.291
Listen, mum, I'm gonna have
to call you back, all right?

836
01:36:31.458 --> 01:36:33.394
All right. Ta-ra.

837
01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:28.101
Who's like us?

838
01:39:29.771 --> 01:39:32.105
Not many.
