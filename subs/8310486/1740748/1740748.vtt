00:00:03.408 --> 00:00:04.445
I love you, Rory.

2
00:00:06.554 --> 00:00:08.070
I love you, too, Dean.

3
00:00:10.656 --> 00:00:12.847
Are you comfortable? Am I killing your arm?

4
00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:14.302
- My arm is fine.
- I could move.

5
00:00:14.363 --> 00:00:15.449
Don't you dare move.

6
00:00:17.364 --> 00:00:22.710
This right here, is - the textbook definition of a perfect moment.

7
00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:24.515
Yeah, it is.

8
00:00:27.936 --> 00:00:29.052
And earlier?

9
00:00:32.344 --> 00:00:33.931
That was pretty perfect too.

10
00:00:34.874 --> 00:00:39.190
However, as a guy, I was trying not to be a pig.

11
00:00:40.618 --> 00:00:42.631
- And I'm happy, are you happy?
- I'm very happy.

12
00:00:44.923 --> 00:00:46.650
Happy, but not chatty?

13
00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:49.424
I'm just…

14
00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:53.234
trying to make sure that all this is really happening.

15
00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.991
It is.

16
00:01:04.143 --> 00:01:06.510
- Hey, you know what I think we need?
- What?

17
00:01:07.258 --> 00:01:10.278
A song. Like a song that's "our song".

18
00:01:10.806 --> 00:01:11.431
Okay.

19
00:01:11.534 --> 00:01:15.153
Something romantic, but not mushy, something that will make us remember this.

20
00:01:16.223 --> 00:01:18.568
Ah, believe me, I'm remembering this.

21
00:01:18.628 --> 00:01:19.290
Oh, I know.

22
00:01:26.635 --> 00:01:28.537
Okay. Perfect.

23
00:01:29.111 --> 00:01:34.004
So, from now on, no matter what you're doing, where you are,

24
00:01:34.173 --> 00:01:36.381
you'll stop and think of me when you hear this.

25
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.738
- That's not gonna be our song.
- Why not? It's perfect.

26
00:01:43.876 --> 00:01:49.125
It's happy. It's hopeful. It has the word 'candy' in it. Hey, what is more hot than candy?

27
00:01:49.211 --> 00:01:50.154
Pick something else.

28
00:01:51.704 --> 00:01:54.036
"Who can take the sunrise…"

29
00:01:54.897 --> 00:01:56.985
Okay, okay, okay, okay. I'll pick something else.

30
00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:59.717
- No.
- Hand it over, I can't take it anymore.

31
00:01:59.795 --> 00:02:02.631
This is what happens when the women get the remote, ah-ha!

32
00:02:05.264 --> 00:02:06.128
What was that?

33
00:02:07.086 --> 00:02:07.925
Rory!

34
00:02:09.098 --> 00:02:10.357
Hey, what's going on?

35
00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:12.738
Dean came over to borrow something.

36
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.904
Yeah, thanks.

37
00:02:15.416 --> 00:02:16.538
You're welcome.

38
00:02:18.355 --> 00:02:21.606
Well, ah, I should go...

39
00:02:23.562 --> 00:02:24.484
Bye, Lorelai.

40
00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:28.006
Bye, Dean.

41
00:02:32.353 --> 00:02:33.746
So, what did he borrow?

42
00:02:35.568 --> 00:02:39.967
I'm sorry I didn't talk to you about it first. I know I promised I would,

43
00:02:40.034 --> 00:02:44.304
but I swear, I didn't know that this was going to happen.

44
00:02:44.391 --> 00:02:48.353
I mean, I didn't know he was going to show up tonight, and it just happened.

45
00:02:48.455 --> 00:02:51.708
It's awful for you to find out like this, I know, but everything's okay.

46
00:02:51.794 --> 00:02:54.314
I'm okay, and we were, you know, safe -

47
00:02:54.384 --> 00:02:57.570
so all those Trojan Man jokes all these years really apparently stuck.

48
00:02:57.984 --> 00:03:00.972
And I'm lucky, too, because Dean, he's...

49
00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:07.458
well, aren't you glad that it happened with someone who's good and really loves me?

50
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.234
He's married.

51
00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:11.840
- You don't understand the situation.
- Is he still married?

52
00:03:11.912 --> 00:03:14.481
- Yes, but...
- Then I understand the situation.

53
00:03:14.553 --> 00:03:17.963
- I just want what's best for you, that's all!
- You're just mad because I didn't come running to you

54
00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:20.718
to discuss whether or not I was ready for this step. I decided it on my own.

55
00:03:20.775 --> 00:03:22.510
Obviously, you weren't ready for this step.

56
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.867
Hello?

57
00:03:35.183 --> 00:03:35.828
Hello?

58
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.023
Hello?

59
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.876
Hey.

60
00:04:06.031 --> 00:04:07.132
Let's just talk.

61
00:04:09.327 --> 00:04:09.911
No.

62
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.536
You do realize you just leapt out of a moving vehicle.

63
00:05:21.577 --> 00:05:23.763
Everything cannot be on your schedule, Richard.

64
00:05:24.232 --> 00:05:27.214
Now, where is it? I know I put it in here. Aha!

65
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.910
In all the years we've been together, I have never seen you behave as irrationally as...

66
00:05:30.957 --> 00:05:33.158
Emily, I'm talking to you! Will you stop?

67
00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:37.357
Emily, this feud of ours has now reached comical heights that…

68
00:05:37.474 --> 00:05:40.778
Charlie Chaplin, himself, would find hilarious, and he's dead.

69
00:05:40.844 --> 00:05:41.959
Don't follow me, Richard.

70
00:05:42.087 --> 00:05:45.493
Oh, wait, come back. Let me get you a cane and a derby.

71
00:05:52.881 --> 00:05:53.853
What are you doing?

72
00:05:53.926 --> 00:05:57.883
I'm looking for my European luggage, which some imbecile has chosen to hide from me.

73
00:05:58.467 --> 00:06:00.053
What do you need your European luggage for?

74
00:06:00.115 --> 00:06:01.390
To put things in.

75
00:06:01.564 --> 00:06:04.374
- You're making a mess.
- I don't care if I'm making a mess.

76
00:06:04.472 --> 00:06:06.075
Well, who's going to clean all this up, you?

77
00:06:06.131 --> 00:06:09.212
Yes, me, or the maid, or perhaps Pennilyn Lott could come by

78
00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:12.065
after one of your clandestine luncheons and take a stab at it.

79
00:06:12.117 --> 00:06:15.578
Oh, for heaven's sakes. Not that again. She's just a friend!

80
00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.045
I am going to Europe, Richard. I am going to Europe,

81
00:06:18.091 --> 00:06:21.343
and I'm going to have a marvelous time. I'm going to get up at 10:00,

82
00:06:21.384 --> 00:06:24.768
and I'm going to have two glasses of wine at lunch every single day.

83
00:06:24.825 --> 00:06:27.272
Only prostitutes have two glasses of wine at lunch.

84
00:06:27.318 --> 00:06:31.377
Well, then buy me a boa and drive me to Reno because I am open for business.

85
00:06:31.423 --> 00:06:34.143
I - I can't talk to you when you're like this. I'm going to bed.

86
00:06:34.256 --> 00:06:36.324
You go to bed. I'll go to France.

87
00:06:55.233 --> 00:06:56.021
Richard!

88
00:06:57.952 --> 00:06:58.990
Richard!

89
00:06:59.923 --> 00:07:01.807
The door is stuck! Richard!

90
00:07:03.492 --> 00:07:04.858
This isn't funny!

91
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.493
Richard? Richard!

92
00:07:32.907 --> 00:07:33.679
Emily?

93
00:07:33.812 --> 00:07:35.173
You locked me in.

94
00:07:35.378 --> 00:07:36.756
I did not lock you in.

95
00:07:36.824 --> 00:07:38.414
You certainly did lock me in.

96
00:07:38.717 --> 00:07:41.630
The door must be jammed. Did you try jiggling the knob?

97
00:07:41.733 --> 00:07:45.773
I suppose I could do that, or you could just get the hell down here and let me out!

98
00:07:45.972 --> 00:07:47.713
Give me a moment, please.

99
00:07:47.806 --> 00:07:50.543
If you don't come down here right now, I will climb out the window.

100
00:07:50.642 --> 00:07:52.540
You will not climb out the window.

101
00:07:52.593 --> 00:07:55.118
I will. I will climb out the window right now.

102
00:07:55.168 --> 00:07:56.223
Don't you dare.

103
00:07:57.175 --> 00:07:59.776
I'm doing it. I'm climbing out the window.

104
00:07:59.828 --> 00:08:01.584
You better not climb out the window.

105
00:08:02.537 --> 00:08:03.202
Damn it.

106
00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:07.753
Emily Gilmore, I better not catch you climbing out the window.

107
00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:10.657
I'm out the window. I'm out the window.

108
00:08:12.213 --> 00:08:14.307
- Get down from there.
- No!

109
00:08:14.394 --> 00:08:17.215
Emily, get back here. Emily!

110
00:08:26.949 --> 00:08:30.476
Are you having an aneurysm or something? Get inside and put this on.

111
00:08:30.558 --> 00:08:31.424
Get away from me!

112
00:08:31.731 --> 00:08:36.963
Do you seriously think after 39 years of marriage, I would resort to locking you in a basement?

113
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.729
I don't know what you'd resort to. I don't know who you are at all.

114
00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:42.575
I knew the mental illness in your family would catch up with you eventually.

115
00:08:42.637 --> 00:08:45.406
Aunt Cora was not mentally ill! She was athletic!

116
00:08:46.758 --> 00:08:48.268
Oh, fine.

117
00:08:51.551 --> 00:08:53.020
Is there some sort of problem here, folks?

118
00:08:53.255 --> 00:08:54.509
No. There's no problem.

119
00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:57.076
We got a call from some of your neighbors complaining about a disturbance.

120
00:08:57.157 --> 00:08:59.629
We apologize. We're going inside right now.

121
00:08:59.716 --> 00:09:01.233
Do not tell me what to do.

122
00:09:01.305 --> 00:09:02.957
Can I have your security password, please?

123
00:09:03.024 --> 00:09:06.183
Look, it's getting late, so either shoot us or go away.

124
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.882
Fine. We'll just write up a report here and be on our way.

125
00:09:09.339 --> 00:09:12.113
Are you happy, Richard? Now there's a report,

126
00:09:12.246 --> 00:09:14.873
and a report means we'll be in the police blotter.

127
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.076
Petal Huffington reads the police blotter religiously. It's like heroin to her.

128
00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:21.021
You've turned us into the scandal of the neighborhood.

129
00:09:21.119 --> 00:09:22.235
Do you know what, Emily?

130
00:09:22.924 --> 00:09:27.108
If nothing else, this display tonight demonstrates clearly

131
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.234
that you are no longer the woman I married.

132
00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:33.002
The woman you married was your partner. You listened to her.

133
00:09:33.084 --> 00:09:35.220
You consulted with her. You respected her.

134
00:09:35.296 --> 00:09:39.024
So, you are right, Richard. I am definitely not the woman you married.

135
00:09:45.035 --> 00:09:46.934
- Oh, no.
- It's okay.

136
00:09:47.057 --> 00:09:47.871
What happened?

137
00:09:48.184 --> 00:09:50.995
He landed butt first in Taylor's rose bushes.

138
00:09:51.046 --> 00:09:53.744
- Oh, poor thing!
- Didn't slow him down, though.

139
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.014
I managed to tackle him as he headed toward the miniature goat pen, dragged him back here,

140
00:09:58.132 --> 00:10:01.737
threw one of your blankets over him, and, well, there he is - he's gonna be fine.

141
00:10:01.788 --> 00:10:02.759
- Well, that's good.
- Yeah.

142
00:10:03.343 --> 00:10:05.495
So, you were gone for a while.

143
00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:09.559
Yeah, I just had some things to take care of at home. Are you sure he can breathe?

144
00:10:09.621 --> 00:10:14.040
Oh, yeah, I propped his head up. So, uh... you okay?

145
00:10:14.121 --> 00:10:15.116
Yes, I'm fine.

146
00:10:15.704 --> 00:10:19.529
Okay, just - nothing you want to talk about with - with me or...?

147
00:10:19.606 --> 00:10:22.216
Oh my God. We need to take him upstairs.

148
00:10:22.283 --> 00:10:24.623
- LuLu can't see me like this.
- But, Kirk...

149
00:10:24.685 --> 00:10:27.946
- LuLu can't see me like this!
- Okay, she won't. I promise.

150
00:10:28.007 --> 00:10:29.687
- Can I take a look?
- Okay.

151
00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:31.868
I don't want to take a look.

152
00:10:32.303 --> 00:10:33.665
Well, I'm not looking.

153
00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:37.071
Hey! It's a party. What's everybody doing up?

154
00:10:37.141 --> 00:10:39.404
Aw, hey, good timing, Squiggy.

155
00:10:39.486 --> 00:10:42.242
I was just going to check on my loaves and make sure they're rising properly.

156
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.524
The air's a little more humid than I thought it was going to be,

157
00:10:45.569 --> 00:10:47.889
and if the loaves aren't rising properly, then - what are you doing?

158
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.824
- We need you to look at Kirk's butt.
- Why?

159
00:10:49.887 --> 00:10:53.336
Well, because he ran into some rose bushes, and he's got some thorns stuck in it,

160
00:10:53.387 --> 00:10:55.102
- and I thought of you.
- Me? Why me?

161
00:10:55.195 --> 00:10:57.790
Well, because... you're a chef.

162
00:10:58.029 --> 00:10:59.120
- What?
- And you have a kid.

163
00:10:59.194 --> 00:11:01.943
- Yes, that's better. You have a kid.
- Neither of us has kids.

164
00:11:02.009 --> 00:11:06.228
Well, she does, but it's big and - and - and can look at her own butt.

165
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:07.334
I got this, thanks.

166
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:12.767
Okay, well... oh, oh!

167
00:11:13.579 --> 00:11:17.365
I'm gonna need Bactine, antiseptic, and lots of hot towels.

168
00:11:17.442 --> 00:11:18.378
I'll go. I'll be right back.

169
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.164
Hey, Kirk? How are you feeling?

170
00:11:24.251 --> 00:11:26.300
- Is Luke here?
- I'm right here, Kirk.

171
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.627
- Sorry I bit you.
- It's okay, Kirk.

172
00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.610
They were after me, so I ran away.

173
00:11:30.712 --> 00:11:34.373
- Who was after you, honey?
- Assassins. He thinks assassins are after him.

174
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:39.472
They were under my bed in my room, so I ran, and they followed me down the hall,

175
00:11:39.576 --> 00:11:44.874
down the stairs, past Luke and Lorelai kissing, through the yard, over that fence.

176
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.944
Well, the assassins are gone now, Kirk.

177
00:11:47.037 --> 00:11:49.037
- I imagined them?
- I think so.

178
00:11:49.115 --> 00:11:50.890
What about Luke kissing Lorelai?

179
00:11:50.994 --> 00:11:53.205
I think you imagined that, too.

180
00:11:54.158 --> 00:11:55.617
They looked so real.

181
00:11:56.313 --> 00:12:00.546
Okay, Kirk, you just settle down and relax, and I'll be right back.

182
00:12:04.634 --> 00:12:06.200
- Oh, my God!
- Sookie!

183
00:12:06.301 --> 00:12:06.978
You kissed?

184
00:12:07.844 --> 00:12:08.452
Yes.

185
00:12:08.975 --> 00:12:11.109
I can't believe she didn't tell me. Why didn't she tell me?

186
00:12:11.181 --> 00:12:14.432
- It just happened.
- Ooh, Luke, that's wonderful!

187
00:12:15.017 --> 00:12:15.595
Thanks.

188
00:12:15.948 --> 00:12:17.719
I can't wait to tell Lorelai it's wonderful!

189
00:12:17.827 --> 00:12:21.871
Um, could you maybe not say anything for a little while?

190
00:12:22.148 --> 00:12:25.513
- Why?
- Well, I'm just not so sure she wants this out yet.

191
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:26.624
What makes you think that?

192
00:12:26.792 --> 00:12:30.806
Do me a favor and keep it to yourself. Let her tell you if she wants to, okay?

193
00:12:30.898 --> 00:12:34.836
Sure. Okay. Call me Belinda, 'cause my lips are sealed.

194
00:12:34.974 --> 00:12:35.583
Thank you.

195
00:12:36.879 --> 00:12:37.862
- Hey, Luke?
- Yeah?

196
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:39.091
This is good.

197
00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:44.636
I hope so.

198
00:12:53.729 --> 00:12:54.286
Hey.

199
00:12:57.201 --> 00:12:57.897
Hey.

200
00:13:02.597 --> 00:13:04.167
My mom brought by brownies.

201
00:13:09.228 --> 00:13:10.342
You worked late again.

202
00:13:10.758 --> 00:13:11.306
Yeah.

203
00:13:13.769 --> 00:13:15.059
Do you have to work tomorrow?

204
00:13:17.061 --> 00:13:18.383
I work at Doose's tomorrow.

205
00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:26.554
Well, will you be home for dinner? 'Cause I was thinking of cooking or something.

206
00:13:27.225 --> 00:13:27.957
I guess.

207
00:13:30.692 --> 00:13:31.910
I'll try. I don't know.

208
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.697
- You want a brownie?
- No.

209
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:41.104
My mom put gummy bears in them like I'm still three or something.

210
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.132
Oh yeah, and I found your phone. It had fallen in the couch cushions.

211
00:13:47.367 --> 00:13:47.971
Thanks.

212
00:13:48.264 --> 00:13:52.641
It rang a little earlier, about 20 minutes ago. I answered, but they hung up.

213
00:13:54.372 --> 00:13:57.070
- You answered my phone?
- Well, it kind of woke me up.

214
00:13:57.136 --> 00:13:59.404
- Why are you answering people's phones?
- Dean.

215
00:13:59.465 --> 00:14:02.702
I mean, you know it's my phone, Lindsay. This isn't your phone.

216
00:14:03.886 --> 00:14:07.643
- I mean, who was it?
- I don't know. They hung up.

217
00:14:07.755 --> 00:14:10.787
- So you didn't take a message?
- I told you - they hung up.

218
00:14:10.858 --> 00:14:14.228
So, great, uh, you're just answering my phone and not taking messages?

219
00:14:14.351 --> 00:14:16.250
- That's great, Lindsay.
- Dean, wh-

220
00:14:16.312 --> 00:14:18.543
Taylor calls on this phone, and Tom.

221
00:14:18.656 --> 00:14:21.201
I mean, this phone is for business, okay? That's why I have it!

222
00:14:21.283 --> 00:14:21.952
Fine.

223
00:14:22.025 --> 00:14:25.209
What if Tom called, and he had an extra shift for me tomorrow, huh?

224
00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:28.577
I mean he calls to tell me, and you answer, and he thinks maybe he doesn't have the right number,

225
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:33.847
and he hangs up, and then I just lose out, which means we lose out.

226
00:14:34.109 --> 00:14:39.177
God, Lindsay, you know, you don't - you don't get it, do you?

227
00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:43.437
I mean, you have absolutely no respect for me at all. That's just obvious.

228
00:14:45.587 --> 00:14:49.458
I don't want to fight. We always fight.

229
00:14:50.027 --> 00:14:54.295
I won't answer your phone anymore. I was asleep. I didn't think.

230
00:14:55.704 --> 00:14:58.030
I'm sorry, okay?

231
00:14:59.329 --> 00:15:00.231
Yeah...

232
00:15:01.854 --> 00:15:02.724
okay.

233
00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.299
You coming to bed?

234
00:15:06.647 --> 00:15:07.675
In a minute.

235
00:15:10.067 --> 00:15:10.818
Okay.

236
00:15:16.539 --> 00:15:17.552
You mad at me?

237
00:15:19.226 --> 00:15:23.920
No. Just tired. Long day.

238
00:15:25.642 --> 00:15:26.660
I'll be right there.

239
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.668
- Everything looks so good.
- I know it does.

240
00:15:37.952 --> 00:15:40.812
- I want half of that cranberry square.
- Okay.

241
00:15:44.437 --> 00:15:45.501
Kirk, sit.

242
00:15:46.275 --> 00:15:47.023
I'm good.

243
00:15:47.233 --> 00:15:50.311
You can't eat standing up like that. My mother says it gives you cancer.

244
00:15:50.398 --> 00:15:52.082
Really? Mine, too.

245
00:15:52.162 --> 00:15:53.797
Hey, look who came to visit.

246
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.182
Oh, my God, the baby's here!

247
00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:58.798
Hey, Shortstuff. How's it hangin'?

248
00:15:58.866 --> 00:16:03.711
He just came to say hi to everybody and to see the place on which his entire college education depends.

249
00:16:03.917 --> 00:16:08.440
What do you think? Is it gonna be Ivy League, or is it gonna be "Murray's House of Learnin'"?

250
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.344
If we're going by the donut demand, I think he's in pretty good shape.

251
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.551
Okay, Ivy League it is. I just hope you're not stupid. Yeah?

252
00:16:15.777 --> 00:16:18.049
Well, you have fun. Mommy's gotta get back to work.

253
00:16:18.153 --> 00:16:20.610
Be nice, and don't throw up on the buffet.

254
00:16:20.785 --> 00:16:23.019
Jackson, you get over here right now with that baby.

255
00:16:23.078 --> 00:16:24.035
Can you sign this?

256
00:16:24.113 --> 00:16:28.290
Michel, hold it right there. Michel. Michel, I have a complaint.

257
00:16:28.357 --> 00:16:30.363
Michel? Michel?

258
00:16:31.235 --> 00:16:32.426
Can I help you?

259
00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:34.378
I was talking to you, and you just walked away from me.

260
00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.123
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were calling someone else.

261
00:16:37.184 --> 00:16:38.486
Someone else named Michel?

262
00:16:38.551 --> 00:16:41.101
If only I could read minds. What can I do for you?

263
00:16:41.162 --> 00:16:44.622
One of my shoes is missing, and the other has been chewed.

264
00:16:45.233 --> 00:16:47.050
Is this a riddle? I'm very busy.

265
00:16:47.102 --> 00:16:50.987
No, this is not a riddle. This is fact. Look at this shoe.

266
00:16:51.059 --> 00:16:56.558
This shoe was practically brand-new, worn twice, and only on smooth-surface floors.

267
00:16:56.676 --> 00:17:00.474
I leave it in your hallway, and in the morning, I find this.

268
00:17:00.535 --> 00:17:02.083
Oh, my God, what have I done?

269
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.672
Excuse me. I'm sorry. Taylor, why did you leave your shoe in the hallway?

270
00:17:05.825 --> 00:17:08.360
- Your complimentary shoeshine.
- Our...

271
00:17:08.442 --> 00:17:10.777
I don't know what he's talking about.

272
00:17:10.848 --> 00:17:11.826
Hey, Lorelai...

273
00:17:11.912 --> 00:17:15.594
Oh, no problem, Luke. Butt right in. I couldn't possibly be talking about anything important.

274
00:17:15.635 --> 00:17:16.426
Good.

275
00:17:17.605 --> 00:17:21.278
I just - I have to get back to the diner.

276
00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:23.719
- Okay, well, um - I…
- I'm still standing here.

277
00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:25.574
- I have to...
- Uh, sure.

278
00:17:25.645 --> 00:17:28.378
Okay. But, thank you so much for coming.

279
00:17:28.497 --> 00:17:31.343
Okay, I'll... guess I'll see you later.

280
00:17:31.416 --> 00:17:31.876
Yeah.

281
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:34.094
You think I'm making all this up.

282
00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.393
No, Taylor, I don't think you're making it up.

283
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.815
You're making a scene is what you're making.

284
00:17:37.897 --> 00:17:42.982
All right, fine. I'm going to find wherever I read that you said you have shoeshine service.

285
00:17:43.038 --> 00:17:46.514
I'm going to show you, and then he can take that look off his face.

286
00:17:46.571 --> 00:17:49.299
Taylor, seriously, I completely believe you.

287
00:17:49.356 --> 00:17:52.207
That man is why mail-order brides were invented.

288
00:17:53.957 --> 00:17:55.852
Oh, my, my. Well, what a surprise.

289
00:17:55.886 --> 00:17:57.490
People will expect me to be here for breakfast.

290
00:17:57.594 --> 00:18:00.390
- Yes, they will.
- Okay, so I'm here for breakfast.

291
00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:01.025
Enjoy!

292
00:18:03.328 --> 00:18:05.535
Rory, we were wondering what happened to you.

293
00:18:05.586 --> 00:18:09.683
I just ran home early this morning to get something. Hey, Davey. Came for breakfast?

294
00:18:09.733 --> 00:18:11.884
Yes, he did. Didn't you, Davey?

295
00:18:11.961 --> 00:18:14.777
Yeah, he did. Oops, he's got that look on his face.

296
00:18:14.854 --> 00:18:16.374
You might want to give him back to me.

297
00:18:16.447 --> 00:18:20.020
Oh, please, if I went running every time some guy tried to crap all over me,

298
00:18:20.066 --> 00:18:21.275
I never would have gotten married.

299
00:18:21.383 --> 00:18:23.927
Hey, Sookie, what did you want to talk - Oh my!

300
00:18:25.084 --> 00:18:27.423
- I'm so happy!
- I'm so glad you're so happy!

301
00:18:27.501 --> 00:18:31.407
Is this is a normal happy or was there cooking sherry involved?

302
00:18:31.473 --> 00:18:33.921
I promised I wouldn't say anything, but I can't help it!

303
00:18:34.089 --> 00:18:36.820
It is so wonderful. Do you know how wonderful it is?

304
00:18:36.903 --> 00:18:39.016
No, no, I don't, but I would love to weigh in.

305
00:18:39.067 --> 00:18:40.285
You're with Luke!

306
00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:43.071
- Ah, how did you know?
- Luke told me.

307
00:18:43.132 --> 00:18:43.567
Oh?

308
00:18:43.638 --> 00:18:45.380
No, I'm sorry, Luke didn't tell me. Kirk told me.

309
00:18:45.426 --> 00:18:48.446
- Kirk told you?
- He saw you. He saw you kiss Luke.

310
00:18:48.692 --> 00:18:51.703
- Oh, my God! You were kissing Luke!
- Well, Sookie, I...

311
00:18:52.885 --> 00:18:56.080
I am so glad! You two are perfect for each other.

312
00:18:56.162 --> 00:19:00.069
I have always thought that someday, if you just sort of turned around

313
00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:04.754
and opened your eyes that you'd see it, and now that you have, I'm just so damn happy.

314
00:19:04.825 --> 00:19:07.196
- Well, I'm...
- You're not gonna die alone.

315
00:19:07.268 --> 00:19:09.597
I mean, somebody will be there. Somebody will know.

316
00:19:09.633 --> 00:19:12.127
Somebody will find the body and call the police and...

317
00:19:12.226 --> 00:19:16.100
Yes, that is a relief. I can't believe Kirk saw us. I thought he was asleep.

318
00:19:16.208 --> 00:19:19.740
Don't worry. I convinced him he was dreaming it all, so I don't think he'll say anything.

319
00:19:19.822 --> 00:19:23.574
I know you're concerned about that. Why are you concerned about that?

320
00:19:23.647 --> 00:19:27.099
- Who said I was concerned about that?
- Luke. He asked me not to say anything.

321
00:19:27.261 --> 00:19:30.718
He said he wasn't sure if you wanted it out. Why wasn't he sure if you wanted it out?

322
00:19:30.794 --> 00:19:31.460
I don't know.

323
00:19:33.104 --> 00:19:33.835
How was it?

324
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:34.656
How was -?

325
00:19:34.968 --> 00:19:37.552
You know. Was it on top of a table?

326
00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:40.384
'Cause I always thought it would be on top of a table - oh, like in "Bull Durham"!

327
00:19:40.441 --> 00:19:41.547
There was no sex.

328
00:19:41.763 --> 00:19:43.077
No sex? Why no sex?

329
00:19:43.606 --> 00:19:46.713
- Can't Luke?
- I'm sure he can. There was no time.

330
00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.000
Everything happened so fast. We were here with the town - and my parents flipping out

331
00:19:50.046 --> 00:19:53.364
and Jason showing up. Oh, no! Jason! What happened to Jason?

332
00:19:53.456 --> 00:19:55.662
- Oh, his condo was on fire.
- It was?

333
00:19:55.765 --> 00:19:58.622
Well, that's what Michel had me say when we called his cell phone.

334
00:19:59.651 --> 00:20:02.032
- Hey, you don't seem happy.
- About what?

335
00:20:02.211 --> 00:20:03.286
About Luke!

336
00:20:03.372 --> 00:20:07.741
Of course I'm happy about Luke. It's just new. I'm still processing it, that's all.

337
00:20:07.828 --> 00:20:10.705
But he knows you're happy, right? I mean, he knows you're processing,

338
00:20:10.757 --> 00:20:12.611
but once you process, there's gonna be sex, right?

339
00:20:12.969 --> 00:20:18.647
He knows. I think he knows. He should know. I hope he knows.

340
00:20:18.708 --> 00:20:22.267
Well, make sure he knows, okay? Because you two together...

341
00:20:22.308 --> 00:20:24.875
Equals getting to the morgue before I smell. I got it.

342
00:20:29.496 --> 00:20:32.660
- Hey. Finish your breakfast already?
- Yeah, I was just leaving you a note.

343
00:20:32.793 --> 00:20:35.093
- Oh, you kind of wolfed it down, there.
- I'm a light eater.

344
00:20:35.267 --> 00:20:37.561
So, um, you leaving?

345
00:20:37.852 --> 00:20:38.400
Yep.

346
00:20:38.528 --> 00:20:40.105
Rory, don't you want to talk?

347
00:20:40.345 --> 00:20:41.088
We already did.

348
00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.325
Oh yeah, but you didn't hear what I wanted to talk about,

349
00:20:43.406 --> 00:20:47.533
which was how Jackson is probably gonna have to dislocate several of Davey's limbs

350
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:49.448
trying to pry him away from Patty and Babette.

351
00:20:49.505 --> 00:20:50.196
I have to go.

352
00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.876
Rory, can't we just sit down for a second and talk about this?

353
00:20:54.949 --> 00:20:57.190
I already heard everything you had to say last night.

354
00:20:57.333 --> 00:21:00.462
You know what? Fine. I give. It's your life. Do what you want.

355
00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:02.398
- Thank you.
- You're 19. You know what you're doing.

356
00:21:02.459 --> 00:21:04.978
- I do know what I'm doing.
- So you don't want to talk. We won't talk.

357
00:21:05.034 --> 00:21:07.748
- Good.
- I wasn't thinking we had to talk like mom and kid.

358
00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:11.404
- I thought we could talk as friends, but hey, forget it.
- I will.

359
00:21:11.454 --> 00:21:14.133
- Not that I take back what I said.
- That's your perogative.

360
00:21:14.297 --> 00:21:19.872
I mean, he's married, and as your friend, I have every right to point out the obvious.

361
00:21:19.918 --> 00:21:21.372
Which you did twice now.

362
00:21:21.428 --> 00:21:25.504
Okay, and I stand by it, though I felt maybe I could help you figure out how to handle this

363
00:21:25.545 --> 00:21:28.915
as your friend who you usually turn to to help you figure out how to handle things,

364
00:21:28.966 --> 00:21:30.855
- but if you don't want to talk, then fine.
- Great.

365
00:21:30.901 --> 00:21:32.319
- We won't talk.
- Love the thought.

366
00:21:32.396 --> 00:21:34.572
Don't worry about me nagging you to talk anymore.

367
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.031
- I'm out.
- Terrific.

368
00:21:36.082 --> 00:21:39.093
In fact, I'm really busy, so if you did change your mind...

369
00:21:39.139 --> 00:21:40.122
- Which I won't.
- Okay.

370
00:21:40.162 --> 00:21:45.155
But if you did, I'm sorry. I can't help. Taylor lost a shoe, so get in line.

371
00:21:45.206 --> 00:21:47.746
- Any end to this speech in sight?
- Bye.

372
00:21:55.687 --> 00:21:58.734
Aha! I told you I'd seen it somewhere. Look at this.

373
00:21:58.842 --> 00:21:59.635
Ah, right.

374
00:22:01.237 --> 00:22:03.772
Uh, Michel, hi. Could you come over here for a minute?

375
00:22:04.217 --> 00:22:06.475
- Very sorry about this, Taylor.
- Yes?

376
00:22:06.577 --> 00:22:11.238
Hey. Here I have a list of services, all printed up nice and neat,

377
00:22:11.293 --> 00:22:15.470
including seaweed wraps, facial peels, watsu massage, and complimentary shoeshines,

378
00:22:15.532 --> 00:22:17.944
- all of which we do not offer.
- Well, we should.

379
00:22:18.338 --> 00:22:18.927
Michel.

380
00:22:18.999 --> 00:22:22.128
I mentioned them several times before, but you don't listen to me.

381
00:22:22.189 --> 00:22:27.412
Sookie wants to make each guest a meringue hat, and you say, "Oh, Sookie, what a brilliant idea. "

382
00:22:27.443 --> 00:22:32.040
But I want to pamper our guests with services that we don't have, and you tell me to answer the phone.

383
00:22:32.106 --> 00:22:35.536
I'm very sorry about this, Taylor. We will replace your shoes, I promise you.

384
00:22:35.589 --> 00:22:38.112
Fine. I'm a 61/2, narrow.

385
00:22:38.306 --> 00:22:41.440
- Okay. I can't believe you did this.
- Oh, you can too.

386
00:22:41.491 --> 00:22:43.612
Get on the phone and find me shoes and have them here by tonight,

387
00:22:43.703 --> 00:22:46.474
- and get your dogs off the premises immediately.
- My dogs aren't...

388
00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:50.894
- It's been a rough weekend. Don't screw with me.
- If Kirk can sleep inside, why can't my Chows?

389
00:22:50.969 --> 00:22:55.265
- Get them and take them home.
- Okay, okay, I just have to locate Pau-Pau.

390
00:22:55.411 --> 00:22:56.556
- What?
- He went out for a walk.

391
00:22:56.656 --> 00:22:59.888
- He's around. He was just testing his boundaries.
- Apparently, so are you.

392
00:22:59.964 --> 00:23:01.106
I'm going.

393
00:23:03.374 --> 00:23:04.190
Pau-Pau?

394
00:23:09.806 --> 00:23:11.357
- Luke's.
- It's me.

395
00:23:11.576 --> 00:23:13.210
- Hello?
- It's me.

396
00:23:13.456 --> 00:23:15.478
- Oh, hi.
- Can we talk?

397
00:23:15.616 --> 00:23:19.015
- Well, we're kind of busy.
- Burger and patty melt.

398
00:23:19.191 --> 00:23:21.530
- I just wanted to talk.
- Talk about what?

399
00:23:21.586 --> 00:23:23.819
- What?
- Talk about what?

400
00:23:23.926 --> 00:23:26.630
- Could you find a quieter place?
- Like where?

401
00:23:26.676 --> 00:23:29.158
- Just go outside.
- Phone doesn't reach outside.

402
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.796
- Something that looks like tuna.
- Use your cell phone.

403
00:23:31.847 --> 00:23:35.656
- Uh, I don't have a cell phone.
- What happened to the phone Nicole gave you?

404
00:23:35.769 --> 00:23:40.043
She got it back in the divorce. Actually, I threw it in the lake after the divorce.

405
00:23:41.903 --> 00:23:44.254
Jeez, what the hell is going on over there?

406
00:23:44.315 --> 00:23:46.095
- What's going on over there?
- Hold on!

407
00:23:46.346 --> 00:23:47.365
You hold on, too.

408
00:23:51.159 --> 00:23:51.816
I'm good.

409
00:23:53.059 --> 00:23:54.694
- I'm good, too.
- Good!

410
00:23:55.215 --> 00:23:58.027
So... you wanted to talk.

411
00:23:58.251 --> 00:24:05.556
Yeah. I just realized that, you know, when I got back last night, I was... a little distracted...

412
00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:07.283
Hey, no big deal.

413
00:24:07.805 --> 00:24:11.512
Uh, no, no, it really was a big deal. I just...

414
00:24:11.584 --> 00:24:13.913
- Seriously, you don't need to...
- We kissed.

415
00:24:17.381 --> 00:24:19.992
- You and me, we kissed?
- I remember.

416
00:24:20.123 --> 00:24:22.997
And it was... unexpected.

417
00:24:23.063 --> 00:24:27.455
Lorelai, relax. I'm fine if you want to just forget it ever happened, really.

418
00:24:27.512 --> 00:24:30.237
No, I don't want to forget it ever happened. It was a great kiss.

419
00:24:30.651 --> 00:24:31.285
Yeah?

420
00:24:31.379 --> 00:24:35.219
If one of us had been a frog, it would have had some seriously impressive consequences.

421
00:24:36.154 --> 00:24:38.832
- Okay.
- So, what do you think?

422
00:24:39.041 --> 00:24:43.450
- I think I'm really relieved you feel that way.
- So you concur?

423
00:24:43.521 --> 00:24:48.406
- Dear God, yes.
- Good. So, then, I guess we'll discuss this later.

424
00:24:48.886 --> 00:24:50.819
- Tonight?
- Tonight.

425
00:24:51.074 --> 00:24:51.696
Okay.

426
00:24:52.851 --> 00:24:55.023
- Thanks for the call.
- Well, my pleasure.

427
00:25:00.119 --> 00:25:02.022
You better finish that whole thing, Pau-Pau.

428
00:25:31.687 --> 00:25:34.816
Hi, it's me. We need to meet.

429
00:25:46.858 --> 00:25:47.748
Come in.

430
00:25:54.978 --> 00:25:55.542
Hey.

431
00:25:56.237 --> 00:25:56.771
Hey.

432
00:25:57.467 --> 00:25:58.413
I'm glad you called.

433
00:25:59.288 --> 00:25:59.923
Me too.

434
00:26:00.713 --> 00:26:02.075
Everything okay at home?

435
00:26:02.488 --> 00:26:04.577
Yeah. Everything's okay.

436
00:26:05.726 --> 00:26:06.447
Good.

437
00:26:15.204 --> 00:26:16.947
Did I ever tell you I like your hair?

438
00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:18.781
My hair?

439
00:26:19.139 --> 00:26:20.189
Your shorter hair.

440
00:26:21.464 --> 00:26:22.703
It's grown out a little.

441
00:26:23.672 --> 00:26:24.352
I like it.

442
00:26:25.822 --> 00:26:27.271
I like it, too.

443
00:26:37.952 --> 00:26:40.721
So, um, you wanted to talk?

444
00:26:41.924 --> 00:26:44.228
Yeah, talk.

445
00:26:45.697 --> 00:26:48.426
Words... wow.

446
00:26:54.718 --> 00:26:55.620
You what?

447
00:26:55.716 --> 00:26:59.251
I slept with Dean in my room last night, in my bed.

448
00:26:59.326 --> 00:27:01.022
- Oh, my God!
- I know.

449
00:27:01.426 --> 00:27:03.838
Who would have even thought that Dean could fit in my bed.

450
00:27:03.889 --> 00:27:09.372
I mean, it's so small, and he's not small. He's tall, not small. Great, I'm rhyming.

451
00:27:09.444 --> 00:27:11.103
I didn't know you were even back together.

452
00:27:11.144 --> 00:27:14.507
Well, we're not. I mean, I guess we are now, but...

453
00:27:14.989 --> 00:27:16.986
- I'm out of breath.
- Sit down.

454
00:27:17.068 --> 00:27:18.804
- My mom caught us.
- Oh, my God.

455
00:27:18.875 --> 00:27:23.171
I mean, she didn't catch us. We were done, but she - we were still horizontal,

456
00:27:23.222 --> 00:27:27.272
and then she saw Dean come out of my room, and she just said all these things.

457
00:27:27.322 --> 00:27:29.739
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

458
00:27:29.802 --> 00:27:30.364
What?

459
00:27:30.519 --> 00:27:32.694
I'm just picturing it in my head, and - oh, my God!

460
00:27:33.077 --> 00:27:34.922
- Lane!
- I'm busy!

461
00:27:34.975 --> 00:27:36.683
Okay, but hello?

462
00:27:36.837 --> 00:27:39.037
- Go, talk, please.
- So, we had a fight.

463
00:27:39.155 --> 00:27:40.768
- You and Dean.
- No, me and my mom.

464
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:41.527
Right.

465
00:27:41.609 --> 00:27:45.243
So then I called him today, and I told him that we need to talk

466
00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:48.991
because there were questions and clarifications

467
00:27:49.037 --> 00:27:55.227
and many tiny details that were totally ignored, because he's, like, perfect, you know?

468
00:27:55.391 --> 00:27:59.052
But I had it all planned out, every word. I was going to be practical,

469
00:27:59.098 --> 00:28:00.931
and I was going to be adult, and then...

470
00:28:01.577 --> 00:28:02.098
Yeah?

471
00:28:02.631 --> 00:28:03.689
And then he walked in.

472
00:28:03.839 --> 00:28:04.479
Yeah?

473
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:08.007
And he kissed me, and I couldn't think.

474
00:28:08.427 --> 00:28:10.777
It was just - and then we -

475
00:28:10.986 --> 00:28:11.744
Again?

476
00:28:11.985 --> 00:28:15.063
Well, once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy to duplicate.

477
00:28:15.246 --> 00:28:16.819
- Where?
- What?

478
00:28:16.936 --> 00:28:19.348
- Where did you do it the second time?
- At Miss Patty's.

479
00:28:19.394 --> 00:28:21.873
- You did it at Miss Patty's?
- Yeah.

480
00:28:22.476 --> 00:28:24.950
- She would be so proud.
- I had it all planned out.

481
00:28:25.032 --> 00:28:28.441
I was going to get everything straightened out. Why did he have to walk in like that?

482
00:28:28.626 --> 00:28:31.063
- Lane!
- In a minute!

483
00:28:31.154 --> 00:28:33.678
- Lane.
- Okay, I'm sorry, I just have to ask you.

484
00:28:34.101 --> 00:28:35.256
How was it?

485
00:28:36.074 --> 00:28:37.555
Why are you whispering?

486
00:28:37.944 --> 00:28:41.354
Because I just think that no matter where she is, my mom can hear this conversation.

487
00:28:42.367 --> 00:28:43.780
It was a little scary.

488
00:28:44.129 --> 00:28:45.389
Was he nice to you?

489
00:28:45.455 --> 00:28:48.486
Yeah. It was - I mean, he loves me, and I love him.

490
00:28:48.947 --> 00:28:51.455
- Oh, my God.
-Lane! Come on!

491
00:28:55.189 --> 00:28:57.436
- What?!
- We were supposed to practice a half an hour ago.

492
00:28:57.683 --> 00:29:01.297
Brian's been yammering on about germs and spores for 20 minutes.

493
00:29:01.353 --> 00:29:04.040
I'm completely freaked out to touch a microphone ever again.

494
00:29:04.111 --> 00:29:06.007
I'm just saying, at the end of the night, who cleans them?

495
00:29:06.053 --> 00:29:06.825
Shut up, Brian.

496
00:29:06.883 --> 00:29:11.885
Look, man, I only have the babysitter till 6:00, then it's my turn to drive them to Gymboree.

497
00:29:11.932 --> 00:29:15.813
Dude, you promised you wouldn't talk about the parental issue during band practice.

498
00:29:15.863 --> 00:29:19.652
We're not having band practice, and it's not a parental issue.

499
00:29:19.709 --> 00:29:23.989
It's being part of the cycle of life, and that, my friend, is pure rock 'n' roll.

500
00:29:24.046 --> 00:29:26.539
Go join "The Polyphonic Spree," you fruitcake.

501
00:29:26.607 --> 00:29:28.629
I'm just saying my bass strap has a smell.

502
00:29:28.699 --> 00:29:30.604
Hey! Shut up, all of you!

503
00:29:30.672 --> 00:29:34.649
Now, that is my friend, and she is here in desperate need of some girl talk,

504
00:29:34.747 --> 00:29:37.276
and in case you haven't noticed, I am a girl, and this, right here,

505
00:29:37.326 --> 00:29:40.501
is what it's like to have a girl in the band, so all of you - deal!

506
00:29:43.204 --> 00:29:46.005
- Sorry.
- Lane, I think I did something that...

507
00:29:46.256 --> 00:29:47.680
- What do you think?
- Of what?

508
00:29:47.767 --> 00:29:50.936
- Of what I did. I need some perspective.
- From me?

509
00:29:51.044 --> 00:29:53.112
- Yes.
- You need some perspective on sex from me?

510
00:29:53.234 --> 00:29:55.426
I need some perspective on sex with Dean from you.

511
00:29:55.484 --> 00:29:57.644
- Oh, well, Dean loves you.
- I know.

512
00:29:57.839 --> 00:29:59.220
- And you love him.
- I know.

513
00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:01.914
- So it seems like...
- He's married.

514
00:30:02.784 --> 00:30:03.475
I know.

515
00:30:03.997 --> 00:30:09.021
How did I overlook that fact? I mean, he said that the marriage was over.

516
00:30:09.071 --> 00:30:13.879
He said that he had told Lindsay or that he was going to tell her or that she already knew somehow,

517
00:30:13.937 --> 00:30:18.374
but I didn't ask anything else. Why didn't I ask anything else?

518
00:30:18.451 --> 00:30:20.483
- I don't know.
- I don't remember what he said.

519
00:30:20.627 --> 00:30:23.633
I don't remember what he told me. I didn't ask anything important.

520
00:30:23.715 --> 00:30:26.313
- You can ask now.
- I tried to ask now.

521
00:30:26.357 --> 00:30:30.672
I ended up having sex on an Al Gilbert record. I need to know some things. I need...

522
00:30:31.701 --> 00:30:33.464
I don't know what I need to do.

523
00:30:33.555 --> 00:30:35.501
- Maybe you should talk to Lorelai.
- No.

524
00:30:35.578 --> 00:30:38.194
- But she already knows about you guys.
- No.

525
00:30:38.266 --> 00:30:41.891
She's better than me at this sort of thing because she at least has a frame of reference.

526
00:30:41.942 --> 00:30:43.794
Talking to her is not an option.

527
00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:45.664
Okay, well, then...

528
00:30:53.424 --> 00:30:54.676
What do you think you're doing?!

529
00:30:55.192 --> 00:30:57.450
- I told you she'd be mad.
- Get away from my drums!

530
00:30:57.502 --> 00:31:00.840
You were in there talking about panty hose or whatever the hell you chicks talk about...

531
00:31:00.881 --> 00:31:03.662
You do not, under any circumstances, touch my drums.

532
00:31:03.713 --> 00:31:06.221
- He adjusted your seat also.
- You what?!

533
00:31:07.219 --> 00:31:10.415
So, make sure they all get the thank-you cards and light the lemon candles

534
00:31:10.498 --> 00:31:14.516
so the rooms smell pretty when they get up there. Thanks, and great job this weekend, great job.

535
00:31:23.671 --> 00:31:26.255
- Oh! My God!
- My, what a lovely greeting.

536
00:31:26.338 --> 00:31:28.432
- How long have you been sitting there?
- Ten minutes. Why?

537
00:31:28.499 --> 00:31:30.490
- You scared me.
- Like I'm Dracula?

538
00:31:30.547 --> 00:31:32.109
Oh, my God, my heart won't stop pounding.

539
00:31:32.154 --> 00:31:34.459
Stop being so dramatic. I just showed up for lunch.

540
00:31:34.714 --> 00:31:40.541
It's not as if I did anything truly terrifying like telling you that butt-crack-baring jeans had gone out of style.

541
00:31:40.587 --> 00:31:42.185
What do you mean you showed up for lunch?

542
00:31:42.236 --> 00:31:46.052
Our lunch, at 1:00. You, me, Rory - the three of us.

543
00:31:46.092 --> 00:31:48.355
- We're having lunch, aren't we?
- I didn't think so.

544
00:31:48.457 --> 00:31:50.766
- You didn't?
- Well, no, but...

545
00:31:50.822 --> 00:31:54.708
When you invited your father and me for the weekend, you said it included a lunch with you and Rory.

546
00:31:54.765 --> 00:31:57.765
Well, yes, I know, but that was before you left.

547
00:31:57.811 --> 00:31:59.536
What does my leaving have to do with anything?

548
00:31:59.604 --> 00:32:02.363
Well, when you left, you weren't here anymore.

549
00:32:02.419 --> 00:32:06.131
- You were gone, so we just assumed lunch was...
- This lunch was your idea.

550
00:32:06.229 --> 00:32:08.711
- Yes, I know, but...
- I did not force it upon you.

551
00:32:08.768 --> 00:32:11.865
- You're right, however...
- If you were too busy or you didn't want it to happen,

552
00:32:11.922 --> 00:32:16.657
- then you didn't have to bring it up at all, did you?
- No, I didn't, but you left, see, so...

553
00:32:16.709 --> 00:32:19.991
All right then. It is now 1:00. You said lunch at 1:00.

554
00:32:20.037 --> 00:32:21.947
I'm here. It's 1:00. I'm hungry. Where's Rory?

555
00:32:22.279 --> 00:32:26.586
- Okay, see, you left, so...
- She's not here, is she?

556
00:32:26.678 --> 00:32:28.501
- No.
- Didn't she know about the lunch?

557
00:32:28.619 --> 00:32:30.887
Yes, mom, she knew about the lunch, but you...

558
00:32:31.133 --> 00:32:33.113
so we... and she...

559
00:32:34.511 --> 00:32:35.675
I'll call her.

560
00:32:36.243 --> 00:32:37.000
I'll wait.

561
00:32:38.394 --> 00:32:39.421
What are you doing?!

562
00:32:40.182 --> 00:32:45.772
- What are you talking about?...
- We're a band! We share!

563
00:32:46.133 --> 00:32:48.571
- Hello?
- Your grandmother is here for her lunch.

564
00:32:48.674 --> 00:32:50.911
- But she left.
- Could you just get back here?

565
00:32:51.008 --> 00:32:53.604
- I'm kind of busy.
- Rory, this is not for me, okay?

566
00:32:53.655 --> 00:32:56.650
This is for your grandmother. You like your grandmother, remember?

567
00:32:56.763 --> 00:32:57.869
- Fine.
- Great.

568
00:32:58.018 --> 00:32:58.719
Bye.

569
00:32:59.009 --> 00:33:01.229
- Chill!
- You're worse than Metallica!

570
00:33:05.279 --> 00:33:07.488
- I did that.
- Did you put in the meat thermometer?

571
00:33:07.535 --> 00:33:10.536
Yes, I put in the meat thermometer. I put in three meat thermometers

572
00:33:10.582 --> 00:33:12.365
just in case one of them wasn't working.

573
00:33:12.446 --> 00:33:17.278
And you put the oven on 450 for 20 minutes and then lowered it to 350 for the last hour.

574
00:33:17.316 --> 00:33:22.461
I did everything you told me. I did it exactly like you told me to, and it still turned out awful.

575
00:33:22.528 --> 00:33:25.303
Maybe you should try something else - meatloaf or chicken.

576
00:33:25.359 --> 00:33:28.159
No, Dean likes roast beef! We had it at our wedding.

577
00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.065
His mother makes it every time we go over there.

578
00:33:30.196 --> 00:33:33.377
I'm making dinner tonight, and it has to be perfect,

579
00:33:33.823 --> 00:33:37.200
- so just tell me how to do it again.
- Okay.

580
00:33:37.274 --> 00:33:38.783
- And write it down.
- Okay.

581
00:33:38.861 --> 00:33:42.424
First, you rub it with a little oil. Then take some fresh ground...

582
00:33:54.123 --> 00:33:55.076
The weather's lovely.

583
00:33:55.437 --> 00:33:56.499
Yes, it is.

584
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:58.896
Rory, don't you think it's lovely?

585
00:33:59.024 --> 00:34:00.473
- It's very lovely.
- Yes.

586
00:34:03.324 --> 00:34:04.088
Lovely.

587
00:34:08.183 --> 00:34:10.835
Well, I don't see any reason to put this off any longer.

588
00:34:10.917 --> 00:34:13.288
Girls, I have something to say that may shock you,

589
00:34:13.559 --> 00:34:16.739
but unfortunately there's nothing I can do about that now.

590
00:34:17.322 --> 00:34:18.734
Lorelai, Rory,

591
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:21.956
Richard and I have separated.

592
00:34:22.898 --> 00:34:24.817
- And?
- What do you mean "and"?

593
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:28.249
That's not enough? You need some sort of mob-related offing to make it interesting?

594
00:34:28.306 --> 00:34:30.226
No, Mom, that's plenty. It's just, we already knew.

595
00:34:30.321 --> 00:34:31.065
Rory didn't.

596
00:34:32.146 --> 00:34:36.287
- Well, I mean, I didn't know know...
- Why would you tell her?

597
00:34:36.396 --> 00:34:37.762
- Mom!
- Who else did you tell?

598
00:34:37.854 --> 00:34:39.399
So, you haven't read "Page Six"?

599
00:34:39.842 --> 00:34:44.735
Rory, if you need to talk about this to try to understand why this is happening,

600
00:34:44.812 --> 00:34:47.296
then by all means, do not ask your mother.

601
00:34:47.362 --> 00:34:50.075
Okay, Mom, I'm sorry. I'm not trying to be insensitive.

602
00:34:50.121 --> 00:34:54.360
It just seemed like a thing you and Dad were going through. I figured you'd make up.

603
00:34:54.442 --> 00:34:56.097
- Well, we didn't.
- I see that.

604
00:34:56.557 --> 00:34:59.193
So, wow, you're really separated?

605
00:34:59.257 --> 00:35:01.785
That's right. Your father's moving into the pool house.

606
00:35:01.832 --> 00:35:03.971
- So then you're not separated.
- Of course we are.

607
00:35:04.027 --> 00:35:07.919
- You're separated by the pool.
- That's it. That's the end of your input on this.

608
00:35:08.035 --> 00:35:09.394
I'm sorry, Grandma.

609
00:35:09.763 --> 00:35:12.112
Well, what's done is done. I'm moving on.

610
00:35:12.226 --> 00:35:15.624
And to celebrate the next stage of my life, I'm going to Europe by myself

611
00:35:15.711 --> 00:35:17.949
for the very first time since I was in college.

612
00:35:18.676 --> 00:35:21.702
- I'm leaving tonight.
- Tonight? That's fast.

613
00:35:21.773 --> 00:35:24.651
Well, I wanted to leave quickly, so I called my travel agent

614
00:35:24.722 --> 00:35:28.717
and insisted that he put me on tonight's plane to Paris no matter what.

615
00:35:28.874 --> 00:35:31.599
He finally managed to bump someone from a church group,

616
00:35:31.665 --> 00:35:33.687
and I've got my seat, and I'm leaving at 10:00.

617
00:35:33.852 --> 00:35:37.031
- And, Rory, my offer to you still stands.
- What offer?

618
00:35:37.108 --> 00:35:40.452
- My offer to escort you around Europe this summer.
- Oh.

619
00:35:40.514 --> 00:35:43.635
Every young lady should do Europe the proper way at least once in her life,

620
00:35:43.702 --> 00:35:47.199
and I would be thrilled to have your company on this very special occasion.

621
00:35:47.322 --> 00:35:50.988
Of course, I know it's very short notice, so if you already have plans for the summer,

622
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:52.720
I completely understand.

623
00:35:53.252 --> 00:35:57.230
You know, I think Europe sounds great. I think you would really enjoy that.

624
00:35:57.292 --> 00:35:58.909
I mean, remember - we loved Paris.

625
00:35:59.064 --> 00:36:01.290
You don't have anything special planned for the summer, do you?

626
00:36:01.776 --> 00:36:04.868
- No, nothing special.
- Well, then? What do you say?

627
00:36:05.253 --> 00:36:06.886
Would you like to be impulsive with me?

628
00:36:07.992 --> 00:36:11.570
- Sure, Grandma, I'd love to.
- That is just wonderful!

629
00:36:11.714 --> 00:36:15.528
I'll call Ralphie right away and tell him to bump another Baptist.

630
00:36:15.601 --> 00:36:19.308
We'll have a wonderful time, you and I. It'll be just like "Gigi. "

631
00:36:19.752 --> 00:36:22.123
- Lorelai, I'm gonna use your phone.
- Be my guest, Mom.

632
00:36:27.612 --> 00:36:30.331
Europe? Cool.

633
00:36:32.676 --> 00:36:35.226
- What?
- So, what is this, a Henry James novel?

634
00:36:35.333 --> 00:36:38.533
The young lady acts up, and her family ships her off to Europe?

635
00:36:38.609 --> 00:36:39.429
Oh, come on.

636
00:36:39.501 --> 00:36:42.097
How fast did you tell Grandma that I had nothing to do this summer?

637
00:36:42.164 --> 00:36:44.329
- I'm not shipping you off.
- Oh, please!

638
00:36:44.376 --> 00:36:48.021
I'm not. I'm just - okay, maybe I am.

639
00:36:48.313 --> 00:36:52.398
I wasn't planning on it, but maybe in the back of my mind, I just thought...

640
00:36:52.444 --> 00:36:53.627
Say Goodbye to Daisy Miller.

641
00:36:53.726 --> 00:36:57.139
Okay, fine, so maybe I suggested the trip to give you some time to...

642
00:36:57.195 --> 00:36:58.736
Travel back to the turn of the century?

643
00:36:58.839 --> 00:37:01.577
To think - but you did not have to accept.

644
00:37:01.639 --> 00:37:04.065
- I did too.
- No, Rory, you didn't.

645
00:37:04.144 --> 00:37:09.365
You're 19 now, remember? You're all grown up, and you can handle your own affairs.

646
00:37:09.406 --> 00:37:13.272
Sorry. That's a bad choice of words. You can handle your own life events,

647
00:37:13.329 --> 00:37:16.094
so if you didn't want to go to Europe, all you had to do was say you didn't want to go,

648
00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.832
but you didn't, so I assume you do want to go.

649
00:37:20.779 --> 00:37:21.991
You do want to go?

650
00:37:23.666 --> 00:37:27.706
How come? I mean, what about Dean? You're just gonna go off and leave now?

651
00:37:27.763 --> 00:37:30.062
- None of your business.
- Did something happen?

652
00:37:30.128 --> 00:37:32.944
Did you guys have a fight, or is it something else? Is it Lindsay?

653
00:37:32.995 --> 00:37:37.123
We didn't have a fight. Everything is fine with Dean. I want to go so I can get away from you.

654
00:37:37.757 --> 00:37:41.325
I'm sorry, weren't you supposed to go through this phase like five years ago?

655
00:37:41.448 --> 00:37:44.801
'Cause, I mean, seriously, at this point, storming into your room

656
00:37:44.853 --> 00:37:47.980
and blasting your goth rock - it's just gonna confuse your roommates.

657
00:37:48.171 --> 00:37:49.737
Tell Grandma I had to pack.

658
00:39:04.837 --> 00:39:08.019
Come on, girls, hurry up. We have an adventure to embark on.

659
00:39:08.089 --> 00:39:11.618
There you go - my picture I.D. And my boarding pass. Rory, hurry up.

660
00:39:11.674 --> 00:39:14.244
You have to hold your own boarding pass, and you need your I.D.

661
00:39:14.575 --> 00:39:19.226
Lorelai, say your good byes here. If you don't have a boarding pass, you can't go farther - am I right?

662
00:39:19.483 --> 00:39:24.310
I'm right, Lorelai. If you need to search me, that's just fine. Don't be afraid to ask.

663
00:39:24.721 --> 00:39:26.414
- Bye, Lorelai.
- Bye, Mom.

664
00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:29.343
Hey, hey, hold on a sec. You have everything you need?

665
00:39:29.554 --> 00:39:30.162
Yeah.

666
00:39:30.281 --> 00:39:31.606
You have trashy-magazine money?

667
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:33.573
Those magazines make Grandma crazy.

668
00:39:33.644 --> 00:39:36.091
Yeah, well, here's 20 bucks. It's a long flight.

669
00:39:37.142 --> 00:39:38.636
Rory, hurry, please!

670
00:39:38.984 --> 00:39:41.136
Coming, Grandma. I have to go.

671
00:39:41.299 --> 00:39:43.131
Yeah, you do. Okay, so, um...

672
00:39:45.012 --> 00:39:47.100
have fun, and uh...

673
00:39:48.874 --> 00:39:52.589
if you need to talk about anything, just please call me, okay?

674
00:39:54.855 --> 00:39:55.717
Okay.

675
00:40:14.382 --> 00:40:17.901
Hey, it's me. Uh, listen, I got a call from my sister and T.J.

676
00:40:17.952 --> 00:40:20.186
They're up in Maine, and they got into a little accident -

677
00:40:20.231 --> 00:40:23.211
nothing major, just each one of them broke an arm and a leg,

678
00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:26.509
so anyhow, they can't run the Renaissance Fair booth for a couple of weeks.

679
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:30.871
So they asked me to come and help them out, and I, unfortunately, answered the phone,

680
00:40:30.917 --> 00:40:35.930
so I'm on my way to Maine. I'll be back in about a week. Okay? Bye.

681
00:40:36.158 --> 00:40:36.902
Great.

682
00:40:37.916 --> 00:40:41.280
Hey, it's me again. I'm not sure if we're at the point in this relationship

683
00:40:41.326 --> 00:40:44.270
where you actually need to know that much information about my whereabouts,

684
00:40:44.296 --> 00:40:48.473
so if we're not, I'm sorry. I could have just said, "I'm going out of town, and I'll call you later. "

685
00:40:48.524 --> 00:40:51.372
So I'm going out of town, and I'll call you later.

686
00:40:53.076 --> 00:40:56.174
Me again, the idiot that leaves you three rambling messages on your machine.

687
00:40:56.225 --> 00:40:59.860
I just wanted to tell you I got a cell phone before I left, so,

688
00:41:00.695 --> 00:41:05.667
you know, you could call if you want, but only if you want, so that's it.

689
00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:06.777
Ah!

690
00:41:06.906 --> 00:41:09.235
- Yeah, a number might be good.
- Thank you.

691
00:41:09.364 --> 00:41:13.746
860-294-1986. Okay, bye.

692
00:41:14.801 --> 00:41:19.701
Just... don't change your mind until I get back, okay?

693
00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:22.548
Okay. Talk to you later.

694
00:41:35.025 --> 00:41:37.883
- Hello?
- Well, if it isn't Dean Moriarty.

695
00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:41.394
- Yeah, this is the life.
- So, are Liz and T.J. okay?

696
00:41:41.451 --> 00:41:44.220
Yeah, they're just not getting around too well. Liz is all panicked

697
00:41:44.297 --> 00:41:48.793
that if they don't finish out the season, they're gonna lose their spot next to the apple doll booth,

698
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:51.988
which is apparently the prime spot, so I said I'd help them out.

699
00:41:52.039 --> 00:41:54.870
- Very chivalrous of you.
- Yeah, I'm a regular Lancelot.

700
00:41:54.928 --> 00:41:58.694
- So, you get my messages?
- Oh, no, did you leave a message?

701
00:41:58.757 --> 00:42:02.377
Sorry, my answering machine dropped dead of exhaustion. What did you say?

702
00:42:02.638 --> 00:42:04.532
- Not much.
- Okay.

703
00:42:05.902 --> 00:42:06.790
So...

704
00:42:07.896 --> 00:42:08.890
So...

705
00:42:09.458 --> 00:42:10.978
That was a hell of a test run.

706
00:42:11.045 --> 00:42:13.328
- You mean for the inn, of course.
- Of course.

707
00:42:13.426 --> 00:42:17.019
Yes, it was. Although, you know, until you have a successful second go-round,

708
00:42:17.071 --> 00:42:19.143
you really don't know if everything's gonna work.

709
00:42:19.272 --> 00:42:21.254
Then I guess there's got to be a second go-round.

710
00:42:21.443 --> 00:42:24.925
Well, yes, it's the only thing that makes really good business sense.

711
00:42:24.997 --> 00:42:26.451
So, where are you right now?

712
00:42:27.056 --> 00:42:30.225
About 10 minutes from "if I lived here, I'd blow my brains out. "

713
00:42:30.479 --> 00:42:33.270
Ah, yes, I hear it's lovely there this time of year.

714
00:42:34.079 --> 00:42:37.270
