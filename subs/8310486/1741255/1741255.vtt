00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:05.765
I love you, Rory.

2
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.240
I love you, too, Dean.

3
00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:13.608
Are you comfortable?
Am I killing your arm?

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.079
- My arm is fine.
- I could move.

5
00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:16.740
Don't you dare move.

6
00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.278
This, right here, is...

7
00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:23.488
the textbook definition
of a perfect moment.

8
00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:25.356
Yeah, it is.

9
00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:30.127
And earlier?

10
00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:35.294
That was pretty perfect, too.

11
00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:39.800
However, as a guy,
I was trying not to be a pig.

12
00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.536
- I'm happy. Are you happy?
- I'm very happy.

13
00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:47.475
Happy but not chatty?

14
00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:50.581
I'm just...

15
00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:54.380
trying to make sure
that all this is really happening.

16
00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:56.081
It is.

17
00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.656
- Hey, you know what I think we need?
- What?

18
00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:12.194
- A song. Like, a song that's our song.
- Okay.

19
00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:15.899
Something romantic, but not mushy.
Something that'll make us remember this.

20
00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:20.275
- Believe me, I'm remembering this.
- I know.

21
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.288
Okay, perfect.

22
00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:32.380
So, from now on...

23
00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:34.960
no matter what you're doing,
where you are...

24
00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:37.619
you will stop and think of me
when you hear this.

25
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.427
- That's not gonna be our song!
- Why not? It's perfect.

26
00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:47.871
It's happy. It's hopeful.
It has the word "candy" in it.

27
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:51.206
- What is more hot than candy?
- Pick something else.

28
00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:58.750
- Okay, I'll pick something else.
- No.

29
00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:00.513
Hand it over. I can't take it anymore.

30
00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:02.680
This is what happens
when the women get the remote.

31
00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:07.822
- What was that?
- What?

32
00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:08.986
Rory!

33
00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:11.923
Hey, what's going on?

34
00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:14.728
- Dean came over to borrow something.
- Yeah.

35
00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:16.262
Thanks.

36
00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:17.960
You're welcome.

37
00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:22.197
Well, I should go.

38
00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:26.174
Bye, Lorelai.

39
00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:29.212
Bye, Dean.

40
00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:35.151
What did he borrow?

41
00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:39.382
I'm sorry I didn't talk to you about it first.

42
00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.016
I know I promised I would...

43
00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:45.020
but I swear I didn't know
that that this was going to happen.

44
00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:48.932
I mean, I didn't know he was gonna
show up tonight and it just happened.

45
00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.232
It's awful for you
to find out like this, I know...

46
00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:55.035
but everything's okay.
I'm okay, and we were, you know, safe...

47
00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:58.703
so all those Trojan Man jokes
all these years really apparently stuck.

48
00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:01.713
And I'm lucky, too, because Dean, he's...

49
00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.246
Well, aren't you glad that it happened
with someone who's good...

50
00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:08.217
and really loves me?

51
00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:11.586
- He's married.
- You don't understand the situation.

52
00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:13.486
- Is he still married?
- Yes, but-

53
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.152
Then, I understand the situation.

54
00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:17.128
I just want what's best for you. That's all.

55
00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.630
You're just mad because I didn't come
running to you...

56
00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.529
to discuss whether or not
I was ready for this step.

57
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.865
- I decided it on my own.
- Obviously you weren't ready for this step.

58
00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:36.575
Hello?

59
00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:39.345
Hello?

60
00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.304
Hey.

61
00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:08.440
Let's just talk.

62
00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:10.972
No.

63
00:05:19.952 --> 00:05:22.853
You do realize you just leapt out
of a moving vehicle.

64
00:05:22.922 --> 00:05:25.186
Everything cannot be
on your schedule, Richard.

65
00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:27.818
Now, where is it? I know I put it in here.

66
00:05:28.227 --> 00:05:32.163
In all the years we've been together, I have
never seen you behave as irrationally as...

67
00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:34.722
Emily, I'm talking to you! Will you stop?

68
00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:38.303
Emily, this feud of ours
has now reached comical heights...

69
00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:42.000
that Charlie Chaplin himself
would find hilarious, and he's dead.

70
00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:43.406
Don't follow me, Richard.

71
00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:46.877
Wait, come back.
Let me get you a cane and a derby.

72
00:05:54.053 --> 00:05:56.886
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking for my European luggage...

73
00:05:56.956 --> 00:05:59.447
which some imbecile has chosen
to hide from me.

74
00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:01.356
What do you need
your European luggage for?

75
00:06:01.427 --> 00:06:04.157
- To put things in.
- You're making a mess.

76
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.461
- I don't care if I'm making a mess.
- Who's going to clean all this up, you?

77
00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:09.091
Yes, me, or the maid...

78
00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:12.535
or perhaps Pennilyn Lott can come by
after one of your clandestine luncheons...

79
00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:13.594
and take a stab at it.

80
00:06:13.673 --> 00:06:16.904
For heaven's sake, not that again.
She's just a friend.

81
00:06:16.976 --> 00:06:18.637
I am going to Europe, Richard.

82
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:21.373
I'm going to Europe
and I'm going to have a marvelous time.

83
00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:22.709
I'm going to get up at 10:00...

84
00:06:22.782 --> 00:06:26.115
and I'm going to have two glasses of wine
at lunch every single day.

85
00:06:26.185 --> 00:06:28.585
Only prostitutes have two glasses of wine
at lunch.

86
00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:32.784
Well, then buy me a boa and drive me
to Reno because I am open for business.

87
00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:35.553
I can't talk to you when you're like this.
I'm going to bed.

88
00:06:35.628 --> 00:06:37.493
You go to bed. I'll go to France.

89
00:06:56.616 --> 00:06:57.844
Richard!

90
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.151
The door is stuck. Richard!

91
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.419
This isn't funny!

92
00:07:31.584 --> 00:07:32.812
Richard?

93
00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:36.786
- Emily?
- You locked me in.

94
00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:39.890
- I did not lock you in.
- You certainly did lock me in.

95
00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:43.024
The door must be jammed.
Did you try jiggling the knob?

96
00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:47.054
I suppose I could do that, or you could just
get the hell down here and let me out!

97
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.127
Give me a moment, please.

98
00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:52.035
If you don't come down here right now,
I will climb out the window.

99
00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:53.901
You will not climb out the window.

100
00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:56.498
I will.
I will climb out the window right now.

101
00:07:56.576 --> 00:07:58.441
Don't you dare.

102
00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:03.141
- I'm doing it. I'm climbing out the window.
- You better not climb out the window.

103
00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:06.284
- Damn it.
- Emily Gilmore...

104
00:08:06.552 --> 00:08:09.419
I better not catch you
climbing out the window.

105
00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:12.188
I'm out the window.

106
00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:15.584
- Get down from there.
- No!

107
00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:17.595
Emily, get back here.

108
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.024
Emily!

109
00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:30.266
Are you having an aneurysm
or something?

110
00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:32.971
- Get inside and put this on.
- Get away from me!

111
00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:35.673
Do you seriously think
that after 39 years of marriage...

112
00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:38.148
I would resort to locking you
in a basement?

113
00:08:38.217 --> 00:08:40.913
I don't know what you'd resort to.
I don't know who you are at all.

114
00:08:40.987 --> 00:08:44.081
I knew the mental illness in your family
would catch up with you eventually.

115
00:08:44.156 --> 00:08:47.091
Aunt Cora was not mentally ill.
She was athletic!

116
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.725
Oh, fine.

117
00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:55.829
- Is there some sort of problem here, folks?
- No. There's no problem.

118
00:08:55.902 --> 00:08:58.700
We got a call from some of your neighbors
complaining about a disturbance.

119
00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:00.898
We apologize.
We're going inside right now.

120
00:09:00.973 --> 00:09:02.565
Do not tell me what to do.

121
00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:04.303
Can we have
your security password, please?

122
00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:07.437
Look, it's getting late,
so either shoot us or go away.

123
00:09:07.513 --> 00:09:10.505
Fine. We'll just write up a report here
and be on our way.

124
00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:13.477
Are you happy, Richard?
Now there's a report.

125
00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:16.111
And a report means
we'll be in the police blotter.

126
00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:19.089
Petal Huffington reads
the police blotter religiously.

127
00:09:19.158 --> 00:09:22.491
It's like heroin to her. You've turned us
into the scandal of the neighborhood.

128
00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:24.086
Do you know what, Emily?

129
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.430
If nothing else,
this display tonight demonstrates clearly...

130
00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:30.662
that you are no longer
the woman I married.

131
00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:33.662
The woman you married was your partner.

132
00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:36.640
You listened to her. You consulted
with her. You respected her.

133
00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:40.406
So, you are right, Richard. I am definitely
not the woman you married.

134
00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:48.344
- Oh, no.
- It's okay.

135
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:49.445
What happened?

136
00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:52.184
He landed butt first
in Taylor's rose bushes.

137
00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:53.589
Oh, poor thing.

138
00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:56.389
Didn't slow him down, though.
I managed to tackle him...

139
00:09:56.462 --> 00:09:58.259
as he headed toward
the miniature goat pen...

140
00:09:58.331 --> 00:09:59.628
dragged him back here...

141
00:09:59.699 --> 00:10:01.929
threw one of your blankets over him,
and there he is.

142
00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:04.526
- He's gonna be fine.
- That's good.

143
00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:06.832
So, you were gone for a while.

144
00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:09.704
Huh? Yeah, I just had some things
to take care of at home.

145
00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:13.211
- Are you sure he can breathe?
- Yeah, I propped his head up. So...

146
00:10:14.513 --> 00:10:16.674
- you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

147
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:21.545
Okay, just...
Nothing you want to talk about with me-

148
00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:25.454
- My God, we need to take him upstairs.
- Lulu can't see me like this.

149
00:10:25.524 --> 00:10:27.924
- But, Kirk-
- Lulu can't see me like this!

150
00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:30.189
Okay, she won't. I promise.
Can I take a look?

151
00:10:30.262 --> 00:10:31.627
Okay.

152
00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:35.031
- I don't want to take a look.
- Well, I'm not looking.

153
00:10:35.234 --> 00:10:37.134
Hey! It's a party.

154
00:10:37.203 --> 00:10:40.661
- What's everybody doing up?
- Good timing, Squiggy.

155
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.834
I was just going to check on my loaves
and make sure they're rising properly.

156
00:10:43.909 --> 00:10:46.309
The air's a little more humid
than I thought it was going to be...

157
00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:48.313
and if the loaves aren't
rising properly, then...

158
00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:50.679
- What are you doing?
- I need you to look at Kirk's butt.

159
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.116
- Why?
- Because he ran into some rose bushes...

160
00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:55.585
and he's got some thorns stuck in it,
and I thought of you.

161
00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:58.954
- Why me?
- Well, because you're a chef.

162
00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:00.690
- What?
- And you have a kid.

163
00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.627
- Yes, that's better. You have a kid.
- Neither of us has kids.

164
00:11:03.696 --> 00:11:07.496
Well, she does, but it's big
and can look at her own butt.

165
00:11:07.566 --> 00:11:08.999
I got this, thanks.

166
00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:11.633
Okay.

167
00:11:15.207 --> 00:11:18.608
I'm gonna need Bactine, antiseptic,
and lots of hot towels.

168
00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:20.236
I'll go. I'll be right back.

169
00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:25.510
Hey, Kirk? How are you feeling?

170
00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:27.882
- Is Luke here?
- I'm right here, Kirk.

171
00:11:27.953 --> 00:11:29.944
- Sorry I bit you.
- It's okay, Kirk.

172
00:11:30.022 --> 00:11:33.287
- They were after me, so I ran away.
- Who was after you, honey?

173
00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:35.725
Assassins.
He thinks assassins are after him.

174
00:11:35.795 --> 00:11:37.729
They were under my bed in my room.

175
00:11:37.797 --> 00:11:42.097
So I ran and they followed me
down the hall, down the stairs...

176
00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:46.532
past Luke and Lorelai kissing,
through the yard, over that fence.

177
00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:48.300
The assassins are gone now, Kirk.

178
00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:50.433
- I imagined them?
- I think so.

179
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:54.536
- What about Luke kissing Lorelai?
- I think you imagined that, too.

180
00:11:55.448 --> 00:11:57.006
They looked so real.

181
00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:01.914
Okay, Kirk, you just settle down and relax,
and I'll be right back.

182
00:12:06.058 --> 00:12:07.525
- Oh, my God!
- Sookie.

183
00:12:07.593 --> 00:12:10.027
- You kissed?
- Yes.

184
00:12:10.096 --> 00:12:12.587
I can't believe she didn't tell me.
Why didn't she tell me?

185
00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:14.098
It just happened.

186
00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:16.828
- Luke, that's wonderful!
- Thanks.

187
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:19.635
I can't wait to tell Lorelai it's wonderful.

188
00:12:19.805 --> 00:12:23.332
Could you maybe
not say anything for a little while?

189
00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:24.398
Why?

190
00:12:24.477 --> 00:12:26.672
I'm just not so sure she wants this out yet.

191
00:12:26.879 --> 00:12:28.141
What makes you think that?

192
00:12:28.214 --> 00:12:32.207
Do me a favor and keep it to yourself.
Let her tell you if she wants to, okay?

193
00:12:32.284 --> 00:12:36.186
Sure. Okay. Call me Belinda
because my lips are sealed.

194
00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:37.586
Thank you.

195
00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.555
- Luke?
- Yeah?

196
00:12:39.625 --> 00:12:41.092
This is good.

197
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.127
I hope so.

198
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.032
Hey.

199
00:12:58.511 --> 00:12:59.637
Hey.

200
00:13:03.883 --> 00:13:05.646
My mom brought by brownies.

201
00:13:10.589 --> 00:13:12.614
- You worked late again.
- Yeah.

202
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.119
Do you have to work tomorrow?

203
00:13:18.264 --> 00:13:19.993
I work at Doose's tomorrow.

204
00:13:23.602 --> 00:13:25.832
Well, will you be home for dinner?

205
00:13:25.905 --> 00:13:28.430
Because I was thinking
of cooking or something.

206
00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:29.769
I guess.

207
00:13:31.844 --> 00:13:33.709
I'll try. I don't know.

208
00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:38.242
- You want a brownie?
- No.

209
00:13:39.118 --> 00:13:42.610
My mom put gummy bears in them,
like I'm still three or something.

210
00:13:45.591 --> 00:13:48.458
Oh, yeah. I found your phone.
It had fallen in the couch cushions.

211
00:13:48.527 --> 00:13:49.516
Thanks.

212
00:13:49.628 --> 00:13:52.062
It rang a little earlier,
about 20 minutes ago.

213
00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:54.023
I answered, but they hung up.

214
00:13:55.768 --> 00:13:58.396
- You answered my phone?
- It kind of woke me up.

215
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.734
- Why are you answering people's phones?
- Dean.

216
00:14:00.806 --> 00:14:04.264
I mean, you know it's my phone, Lindsay.
This isn't your phone.

217
00:14:05.377 --> 00:14:07.470
I mean... Who was it?

218
00:14:07.613 --> 00:14:10.377
- I don't know. They hung up.
- So you didn't take a message?

219
00:14:10.449 --> 00:14:12.041
I told you, they hung up.

220
00:14:12.117 --> 00:14:15.553
So, great, you're just answering my phone
and not taking messages?

221
00:14:15.721 --> 00:14:17.484
- That's great, Lindsay.
- Dean-

222
00:14:17.556 --> 00:14:19.922
Taylor calls on this phone, and Tom.

223
00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:22.620
This phone is for business, okay?
That's why I have it.

224
00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:24.754
- Fine.
- What if Tom called...

225
00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:26.593
and he had an extra shift
for me tomorrow?

226
00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:28.428
He calls to tell me, and you answer...

227
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.230
and he thinks maybe he doesn't have
the right number and he hangs up...

228
00:14:31.303 --> 00:14:35.171
and then I just lose out,
which means we lose out.

229
00:14:35.674 --> 00:14:37.972
God, Lindsay! You know, you don't...

230
00:14:38.911 --> 00:14:40.435
You don't get it, do you?

231
00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:44.778
You have absolutely no respect
for me at all. That's just obvious.

232
00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:50.411
I don't want to fight. We always fight.

233
00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:55.654
I won't answer your phone anymore.
I was asleep. I didn't think.

234
00:14:56.929 --> 00:14:59.420
I'm sorry, okay?

235
00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:01.722
Yeah.

236
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:04.258
Okay.

237
00:15:05.537 --> 00:15:07.095
You coming to bed?

238
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.405
In a minute.

239
00:15:11.477 --> 00:15:12.774
Okay.

240
00:15:17.883 --> 00:15:21.182
- You mad at me?
- No.

241
00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:25.181
Just tired. Long day.

242
00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:28.153
I'll be right there.

243
00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:39.563
- Everything looks so good.
- I know it does.

244
00:15:39.638 --> 00:15:42.471
- I want half of that cranberry square.
- Okay.

245
00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:48.705
- Kirk, sit.
- I'm good.

246
00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:51.909
You can't eat standing up like that.
My mother says it gives you cancer.

247
00:15:51.984 --> 00:15:55.545
- Really? Mine, too.
- Hey, look who came to visit.

248
00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:57.747
Oh, my God, the baby's here.

249
00:15:57.823 --> 00:16:00.291
Hey, short stuff. How's it hanging?

250
00:16:00.392 --> 00:16:03.088
He just came to say hi to everybody
and to see the place...

251
00:16:03.195 --> 00:16:06.528
on which his entire college education
depends. What do you think?

252
00:16:06.598 --> 00:16:10.261
Is it gonna be Ivy League or is it gonna be
Murray's House of Learning?

253
00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:13.032
If we're going by the donut demand,
I think he's in pretty good shape.

254
00:16:13.105 --> 00:16:17.064
Okay, Ivy League it is.
I just hope you're not stupid. Yeah?

255
00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:19.674
You have fun.
Mommy's gotta get back to work.

256
00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:22.339
Be nice, and don't throw up on the buffet.

257
00:16:22.414 --> 00:16:24.882
You get over there
right now with that baby.

258
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:28.147
- Could you sign this?
- Michel, hold it right there.

259
00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:32.156
I have a complaint. Michel?

260
00:16:32.891 --> 00:16:34.051
Can I help you?

261
00:16:34.126 --> 00:16:36.253
I was talking to you
and you just walked away from me.

262
00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:38.728
I'm sorry,
I thought you were calling someone else.

263
00:16:38.797 --> 00:16:40.230
Someone else named Michel?

264
00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:42.733
If only I could read minds.
What can I do for you?

265
00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:46.430
One of my shoes is missing,
and the other has been chewed.

266
00:16:46.905 --> 00:16:51.239
- Is this a riddle? I'm very busy.
- No, this is not a riddle. This is fact.

267
00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:54.677
Look at this shoe.
This shoe was practically brand-new...

268
00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:58.239
worn twice
and only on smooth-surface floors.

269
00:16:58.317 --> 00:17:02.014
I leave it in your hallway,
and in the morning, I find this.

270
00:17:02.087 --> 00:17:05.181
- Oh, my God, what have I done?
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.

271
00:17:05.257 --> 00:17:07.418
Taylor, why did you leave
your shoe in the hallway?

272
00:17:07.493 --> 00:17:09.188
Your complimentary shoeshine.

273
00:17:09.294 --> 00:17:12.320
- Our...
- I don't know what he's talking about.

274
00:17:12.398 --> 00:17:15.162
- Hi, Lorelai.
- No problem, Luke. Butt right in.

275
00:17:15.234 --> 00:17:17.532
I couldn't possibly be talking
about anything important.

276
00:17:17.603 --> 00:17:19.571
- Good.
- I can't...

277
00:17:19.638 --> 00:17:24.132
- I have to get back to the diner.
- Okay.

278
00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:26.609
- I'm still standing here.
- I have to...

279
00:17:26.678 --> 00:17:29.806
- Sure.
- Okay. But thank you so much for coming.

280
00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:33.682
- Okay, I'll... Guess I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

281
00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:37.152
- You think I'm making all this up.
- No, I don't think you're making it up.

282
00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:39.417
You're making a scene
is what you're making.

283
00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:41.015
All right, fine.

284
00:17:41.093 --> 00:17:44.585
I'm going to find wherever I read
that you said you have shoeshine service.

285
00:17:44.663 --> 00:17:48.030
I'm going to show you,
and then he can take that look off his face.

286
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.898
Taylor, seriously, I completely believe you.

287
00:17:50.969 --> 00:17:54.097
That man is why
mail-order brides were invented.

288
00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:57.432
Oh, my, my. Well, what a surprise.

289
00:17:57.509 --> 00:17:59.409
People will expect me
to be here for breakfast.

290
00:17:59.478 --> 00:18:01.946
- Yes, they will.
- Okay, so I'm here for breakfast.

291
00:18:02.014 --> 00:18:03.140
Enjoy.

292
00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.045
Rory, we were wondering
what happened to you.

293
00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:09.781
I just ran home early
this morning to get something.

294
00:18:09.855 --> 00:18:13.450
- Hey, Davey, you came for breakfast?
- Yes, he did. Didn't you, Davey?

295
00:18:13.525 --> 00:18:16.289
Yeah, he did.
He's got that look on his face.

296
00:18:16.361 --> 00:18:17.988
You might want to give him back to me.

297
00:18:18.063 --> 00:18:21.590
Please, if I went running every time
some guy tried to crap all over me...

298
00:18:21.667 --> 00:18:22.929
I never would have gotten married.

299
00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:24.866
Hey, Sookie, what did you want to talk-

300
00:18:26.572 --> 00:18:29.598
- I'm so happy!
- I'm so glad you're so happy!

301
00:18:29.675 --> 00:18:33.042
Is this is a normal happy
or was there cooking sherry involved?

302
00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:35.910
I promised I wouldn't say anything,
but I can't help it!

303
00:18:35.981 --> 00:18:38.575
It is so wonderful.
Do you know how wonderful it is?

304
00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.948
No, I don't, but I would love to weigh in.

305
00:18:41.019 --> 00:18:44.011
- You're with Luke.
- How did you know?

306
00:18:44.089 --> 00:18:46.387
Luke told me.
No, I'm sorry, Luke didn't tell me.

307
00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:47.789
- Kirk told me.
- Kirk told you?

308
00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.794
He saw you. He saw you kiss Luke.

309
00:18:50.229 --> 00:18:52.129
Oh, my God. You were kissing Luke!

310
00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:55.894
- Well, Sookie, I-
- I am so glad!

311
00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:59.734
You two are perfect for each other.
I have always thought that someday...

312
00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:04.105
if you just sort of turned around
and opened your eyes, that you'd see it.

313
00:19:04.176 --> 00:19:06.269
And now you have,
I'm just so damn happy.

314
00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:08.779
- Well, I'm-
- You're not gonna die alone.

315
00:19:08.847 --> 00:19:11.111
Somebody will be there.
Somebody will know.

316
00:19:11.183 --> 00:19:13.515
Somebody will find the body
and call the police and-

317
00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:15.212
Yes, that is a relief.

318
00:19:15.287 --> 00:19:17.721
I can't believe Kirk saw us.
I thought he was asleep.

319
00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:19.916
Don't worry. I convinced him
he was dreaming it all.

320
00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:23.553
So I don't think he'll say anything.
I know you're concerned about that.

321
00:19:23.629 --> 00:19:26.689
- Why are you concerned about that?
- Who said I was concerned about that?

322
00:19:26.765 --> 00:19:28.960
Luke. He asked me not to say anything.

323
00:19:29.034 --> 00:19:30.831
He said he wasn't sure
if you wanted it out.

324
00:19:30.903 --> 00:19:33.599
- Why wasn't he sure if you wanted it out?
- I don't know.

325
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.731
- How was it?
- How was...

326
00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:39.036
You know. Was it on top of a table?

327
00:19:39.111 --> 00:19:42.137
'Cause I always thought it would be
on top of a table, like in Bull Durham.

328
00:19:42.214 --> 00:19:45.115
- There was no sex.
- No sex? Why no sex?

329
00:19:45.551 --> 00:19:48.179
- Can't Luke...
- I'm sure he can. There was no time.

330
00:19:48.253 --> 00:19:50.687
Everything happened so fast.
We were here with the town...

331
00:19:50.756 --> 00:19:52.917
and my parents flipping out
and Jason showing up.

332
00:19:52.991 --> 00:19:56.392
- Oh, no. Jason. What happened to Jason?
- His condo was on fire.

333
00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:57.450
It was?

334
00:19:57.529 --> 00:20:00.396
That's what Michel had me say
when we called his cell phone.

335
00:20:01.233 --> 00:20:03.030
You don't seem happy.

336
00:20:03.101 --> 00:20:04.966
- About what?
- About Luke.

337
00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:07.665
Of course I'm happy about Luke.
It's just new.

338
00:20:07.739 --> 00:20:10.902
- I'm still processing it, that's all.
- But he knows you're happy, right?

339
00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:12.341
He knows you're processing...

340
00:20:12.411 --> 00:20:14.470
but once you process,
there's gonna be sex, right?

341
00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:16.946
He knows. I think he knows.

342
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:22.410
- He should know. I hope he knows.
- Make sure he knows, okay?

343
00:20:22.487 --> 00:20:23.977
Because you two together-

344
00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:26.752
Equals getting to the morgue
before I smell. I got it.

345
00:20:26.825 --> 00:20:28.122
Yes.

346
00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:34.294
- Finished breakfast already?
- Yeah, I was just leaving you a note.

347
00:20:34.366 --> 00:20:36.994
- You kind of wolfed it down there.
- I'm a light eater.

348
00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:39.833
- So, you leaving?
- Yep.

349
00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:42.669
- Rory, don't you want to talk?
- We already did.

350
00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:45.039
Yeah, but you didn't hear
what I wanted to talk about...

351
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.305
which was how Jackson
is probably gonna have to...

352
00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:49.210
dislocate several of Davey's limbs...

353
00:20:49.281 --> 00:20:51.078
trying to pry him away
from Patty and Babbette.

354
00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:52.514
I have to go.

355
00:20:53.385 --> 00:20:56.513
Rory, can't we just sit down for a second
and talk about this?

356
00:20:56.588 --> 00:20:58.920
I already heard everything
you had to say last night.

357
00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:01.152
You know what? Fine. I give. It's your life.

358
00:21:01.226 --> 00:21:02.523
- Do what you want.
- Thank you.

359
00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:05.188
- You're 19. You know what you're doing.
- I do know what I'm doing.

360
00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:06.959
- So you don't want to talk, we won't talk.
- Good.

361
00:21:07.032 --> 00:21:09.592
I wasn't thinking we had to talk
like mom and kid.

362
00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:12.398
I thought we could talk as friends,
but forget it.

363
00:21:12.471 --> 00:21:14.405
- I will.
- Not that I take back what I said.

364
00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:15.940
That's your prerogative.

365
00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:21.603
He's married, and as your friend,
I have every right to point out the obvious.

366
00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.376
- Which you did, twice now.
- Okay, and I stand by it...

367
00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:27.077
though I felt maybe I could help you
figure out how to handle this...

368
00:21:27.152 --> 00:21:29.620
as your friend who you usually turn to
to help you figure out...

369
00:21:29.688 --> 00:21:32.020
how to handle things,
but if you don't want to talk, then fine.

370
00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:33.250
- Great.
- We won't talk.

371
00:21:33.325 --> 00:21:34.986
- Love the thought.
- Don't worry about me...

372
00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.620
- nagging you to talk anymore. I'm out.
- Terrific.

373
00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:40.631
In fact, I'm really busy,
so if you did change your mind-

374
00:21:40.699 --> 00:21:43.327
- Which I won't.
- Okay, but if you did, I'm sorry.

375
00:21:43.402 --> 00:21:44.494
I can't help.

376
00:21:44.569 --> 00:21:48.528
- Taylor lost a shoe, so get in line.
- Any end to this speech in sight?

377
00:21:48.607 --> 00:21:49.733
Bye.

378
00:21:57.749 --> 00:22:00.513
I told you I'd seen it somewhere.
Look at this.

379
00:22:00.585 --> 00:22:01.643
Right.

380
00:22:02.854 --> 00:22:05.448
Michel, hi.
Could you come over here for a minute?

381
00:22:05.724 --> 00:22:08.192
- Very sorry about this, Taylor.
- Yes?

382
00:22:09.027 --> 00:22:12.827
Here I have a list of services,
all printed up nice and neat...

383
00:22:12.898 --> 00:22:15.958
including seaweed wraps, facial peels,
Watsu massage...

384
00:22:16.034 --> 00:22:18.434
and complimentary shoeshines,
all of which we do not offer.

385
00:22:18.503 --> 00:22:20.471
- Well, we should.
- Michel.

386
00:22:20.539 --> 00:22:23.804
I mentioned them several times before,
but you don't listen to me.

387
00:22:23.875 --> 00:22:26.070
Sookie wants to make each guest
a meringue hat...

388
00:22:26.144 --> 00:22:28.977
and you say,
"Oh, Sookie, what a brilliant idea. "

389
00:22:29.047 --> 00:22:31.845
But I want to pamper our guests
with services that we don't have...

390
00:22:31.917 --> 00:22:33.544
and you tell me to answer the phone.

391
00:22:33.618 --> 00:22:37.145
I'm very sorry about this, Taylor.
We will replace your shoes, I promise you.

392
00:22:37.222 --> 00:22:40.191
- Fine. I'm a six-and-a-half, narrow.
- Okay.

393
00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:42.827
- I can't believe you did this.
- You can, too.

394
00:22:42.894 --> 00:22:45.522
Get on the phone, find me shoes
and have them here by tonight...

395
00:22:45.597 --> 00:22:47.394
and get your dogs off
the premises immediately.

396
00:22:47.466 --> 00:22:48.728
My dogs aren't-

397
00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.665
It's been a rough weekend.
Don't screw with me.

398
00:22:50.736 --> 00:22:52.727
If Kirk can sleep inside,
why can't my chows?

399
00:22:52.804 --> 00:22:55.466
- Get them and take them home.
- Okay.

400
00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.405
- I just have to locate Pau-Pau.
- What?

401
00:22:57.476 --> 00:23:00.411
He went out for a walk. He's around.
He was testing his boundaries.

402
00:23:00.479 --> 00:23:03.107
- Apparently so are you.
- I'm going.

403
00:23:05.016 --> 00:23:06.415
Pau-Pau.

404
00:23:11.423 --> 00:23:13.015
- Luke's.
- It's me.

405
00:23:13.091 --> 00:23:14.956
- Hello?
- It's me.

406
00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:17.286
- Oh, hi.
- Can we talk?

407
00:23:17.362 --> 00:23:20.763
- We're kind of busy.
- Burger and patty melt.

408
00:23:20.832 --> 00:23:23.062
- I just wanted to talk.
- Talk about what?

409
00:23:23.135 --> 00:23:25.695
- What?
- Talk about what?

410
00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:28.399
- Could you find a quieter place?
- Like where?

411
00:23:28.473 --> 00:23:30.805
- Just go outside.
- Phone doesn't reach outside.

412
00:23:30.876 --> 00:23:33.743
- Something that looks like tuna.
- Use your cell phone.

413
00:23:33.812 --> 00:23:35.541
I don't have a cell phone.

414
00:23:35.614 --> 00:23:37.411
What happened to the phone
Nicole gave you?

415
00:23:37.482 --> 00:23:39.040
She got it back in the divorce.

416
00:23:39.117 --> 00:23:42.177
Actually, I threw it in the lake
after the divorce.

417
00:23:43.889 --> 00:23:45.686
What the hell is going on over there?

418
00:23:45.757 --> 00:23:47.884
- What's going on over there?
- Hold on.

419
00:23:47.959 --> 00:23:49.358
You hold on, too.

420
00:23:52.764 --> 00:23:55.665
- I'm good.
- I'm good, too.

421
00:23:55.734 --> 00:23:57.998
- Good.
- So...

422
00:23:58.503 --> 00:24:00.664
- you wanted to talk.
- Yeah.

423
00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:04.639
I just realized that, you know,
when I got back last night, I was...

424
00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:07.708
a little distracted.

425
00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:09.474
No big deal.

426
00:24:10.215 --> 00:24:13.150
No, it was a big deal. I just-

427
00:24:13.218 --> 00:24:15.686
- Seriously, you don't need to-
- We kissed.

428
00:24:19.157 --> 00:24:21.682
- You and me, we kissed?
- I remember.

429
00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.628
- And it was unexpected.
- Lorelai, relax.

430
00:24:25.697 --> 00:24:29.064
I'm fine if you want to just forget
it ever happened, really.

431
00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:32.194
No, I don't want to forget it ever
happened. It was a great kiss.

432
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:34.363
- Yeah?
- If one of us had been a frog...

433
00:24:34.439 --> 00:24:37.306
it would have had
some seriously impressive consequences.

434
00:24:37.943 --> 00:24:40.571
- Okay.
- So, what do you think?

435
00:24:40.645 --> 00:24:44.012
I think I'm really relieved
you feel that way.

436
00:24:44.082 --> 00:24:46.209
- So you concur?
- Dear God, yes.

437
00:24:46.284 --> 00:24:50.050
Good. So, then,
I guess we'll discuss this later.

438
00:24:50.655 --> 00:24:52.623
- Tonight?
- Tonight.

439
00:24:52.691 --> 00:24:53.851
Okay.

440
00:24:54.526 --> 00:24:56.517
- Thanks for the call.
- My pleasure.

441
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.898
You better finish
that whole thing, Pau-Pau.

442
00:25:33.732 --> 00:25:36.758
Hi, it's me. We need to meet.

443
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.006
Come in.

444
00:25:56.955 --> 00:25:59.355
- Hey.
- Hey.

445
00:25:59.424 --> 00:26:02.188
- I'm glad you called.
- Me, too.

446
00:26:02.694 --> 00:26:06.596
- Everything okay at home?
- Yeah. Everything's okay.

447
00:26:07.699 --> 00:26:08.825
Good.

448
00:26:17.242 --> 00:26:19.176
Did I ever tell you I like your hair?

449
00:26:20.045 --> 00:26:22.172
- My hair?
- Your shorter hair.

450
00:26:23.381 --> 00:26:25.042
It's grown out a little.

451
00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:27.174
I like it.

452
00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:29.716
I like it, too.

453
00:26:39.864 --> 00:26:42.924
So, you wanted to talk?

454
00:26:44.135 --> 00:26:46.365
Yeah, talk.

455
00:26:47.772 --> 00:26:49.399
Words.

456
00:26:49.674 --> 00:26:50.971
Love.

457
00:26:56.748 --> 00:26:57.737
You what?

458
00:26:57.816 --> 00:27:01.274
I slept with Dean,
in my room last night, in my bed.

459
00:27:01.353 --> 00:27:03.253
- Oh, my God!
- I know.

460
00:27:03.321 --> 00:27:05.915
Who would have even thought
that Dean could fit in my bed?

461
00:27:05.991 --> 00:27:08.323
I mean, it's so small, and he's not small.

462
00:27:08.393 --> 00:27:11.362
He's tall, not small. Great, I'm rhyming.

463
00:27:11.429 --> 00:27:13.158
I didn't know
you were even back together.

464
00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:14.823
We're not.

465
00:27:14.899 --> 00:27:18.335
I guess we are now, but...
I'm out of breath.

466
00:27:18.403 --> 00:27:20.098
- Sit down.
- My mom caught us.

467
00:27:20.171 --> 00:27:22.071
- Oh, my God.
- I mean, she didn't catch us.

468
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.268
We were done, but she...
We were still horizontal.

469
00:27:25.343 --> 00:27:27.743
And then she saw
Dean come out of my room...

470
00:27:27.812 --> 00:27:29.279
and she just said all these things.

471
00:27:29.347 --> 00:27:32.316
- Oh, my God!
- What?

472
00:27:32.517 --> 00:27:35.213
I'm just picturing it in my head,
and oh, my God!

473
00:27:35.286 --> 00:27:37.186
- Lane!
- I'm busy!

474
00:27:37.255 --> 00:27:39.883
- Okay, but hello.
- Go, talk, please.

475
00:27:39.958 --> 00:27:41.186
So, we had a fight.

476
00:27:41.259 --> 00:27:43.090
- You and Dean.
- No, me and my mom.

477
00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:45.026
- Right.
- So then I called him today...

478
00:27:45.096 --> 00:27:47.360
and I told him that we need to talk...

479
00:27:47.432 --> 00:27:51.027
because there were
questions and clarifications...

480
00:27:51.102 --> 00:27:54.401
and many tiny details
that were totally ignored...

481
00:27:54.472 --> 00:27:57.464
because he's, like, perfect, you know.

482
00:27:57.542 --> 00:27:59.874
But I had it all planned out, every word.

483
00:27:59.944 --> 00:28:03.402
I was going to be practical,
and I was going to be adult and then...

484
00:28:03.648 --> 00:28:05.912
- Yeah?
- And then he walked in.

485
00:28:05.984 --> 00:28:10.011
- Yeah?
- And he kissed me, and I couldn't think.

486
00:28:10.288 --> 00:28:13.985
- It was just... And then we...
- Again?

487
00:28:14.059 --> 00:28:17.187
Once you get the hang of it,
it's pretty easy to duplicate.

488
00:28:17.262 --> 00:28:18.854
- Where?
- What?

489
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:21.364
- Where did you do it the second time?
- At Miss Patty's.

490
00:28:21.433 --> 00:28:23.264
You did it at Miss Patty's?

491
00:28:23.334 --> 00:28:25.700
- Yeah.
- She would be so proud.

492
00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.830
I had it all planned out. I was going
to get everything straightened out.

493
00:28:28.907 --> 00:28:30.738
Why did he have to walk in like that?

494
00:28:30.809 --> 00:28:33.039
- Lane!
- In a minute!

495
00:28:33.111 --> 00:28:35.944
- Lane.
- Okay, I'm sorry, I just have to ask you.

496
00:28:36.014 --> 00:28:37.743
- What?
- How was it?

497
00:28:38.516 --> 00:28:39.915
Why are you whispering?

498
00:28:39.984 --> 00:28:41.849
Because I just think
that no matter where she is...

499
00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.979
my mom can hear this conversation.

500
00:28:44.289 --> 00:28:47.349
- It was a little scary.
- Was he nice to you?

501
00:28:47.425 --> 00:28:50.724
Yeah. It was...
I mean, he loves me, and I love him.

502
00:28:50.962 --> 00:28:53.692
- Oh, my God.
- Lane, come on!

503
00:28:56.901 --> 00:28:57.959
What?

504
00:28:58.036 --> 00:28:59.833
We were supposed
to practice a half an hour ago.

505
00:28:59.904 --> 00:29:03.362
Brian's been yammering on
about germs and spores for 20 minutes.

506
00:29:03.441 --> 00:29:05.966
I'm completely freaked out
to touch a microphone ever again.

507
00:29:06.044 --> 00:29:08.103
I'm just saying, at the end of the night,
who cleans them?

508
00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:09.578
- Shut up, Brian.
- Look, man.

509
00:29:09.647 --> 00:29:11.512
I only have the babysitter till 6:00.

510
00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:13.881
Then it's my turn
to drive them to Gymboree.

511
00:29:13.952 --> 00:29:15.647
Dude, you promised you wouldn't talk...

512
00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.881
about the parental issue
during band practice.

513
00:29:17.956 --> 00:29:21.722
We're not having band practice,
and it's not a parental issue.

514
00:29:21.793 --> 00:29:25.991
It's being part of the cycle of life,
and that, my friend, is pure rock 'n' roll.

515
00:29:26.064 --> 00:29:28.555
Go join The Polyphonic Spree,
you fruitcake.

516
00:29:28.633 --> 00:29:31.067
I'm just saying my bass strap has a smell.

517
00:29:31.136 --> 00:29:34.003
Shut up, all of you!
Now, that is my friend...

518
00:29:34.072 --> 00:29:36.802
and she is here
in desperate need of some girl talk...

519
00:29:36.875 --> 00:29:38.706
and in case you haven't noticed,
I am a girl...

520
00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:40.836
and this, right here, is what it's like
to have a girl in the band...

521
00:29:40.912 --> 00:29:42.436
So all of you, deal!

522
00:29:45.316 --> 00:29:48.080
- Sorry.
- Lane, I think I did something that...

523
00:29:48.153 --> 00:29:50.018
- What do you think?
- Of what?

524
00:29:50.088 --> 00:29:52.283
Of what I did. I need some perspective.

525
00:29:52.357 --> 00:29:53.619
- From me?
- Yes.

526
00:29:53.691 --> 00:29:55.283
You need some perspective
on sex from me?

527
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.521
I need some perspective
on sex with Dean from you.

528
00:29:58.163 --> 00:29:59.755
- Dean loves you.
- I know.

529
00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:01.628
- And you love him.
- I know.

530
00:30:01.699 --> 00:30:04.031
- So it seems like...
- He's married.

531
00:30:04.602 --> 00:30:05.762
I know.

532
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:08.265
How did I overlook that fact?

533
00:30:08.373 --> 00:30:11.103
I mean,
he said that the marriage was over.

534
00:30:11.176 --> 00:30:14.907
He said that he had told Lindsay
or that he was going to tell her...

535
00:30:14.979 --> 00:30:18.813
or that she already knew somehow,
but I didn't ask anything else.

536
00:30:18.883 --> 00:30:21.181
- Why didn't I ask anything else?
- I don't know.

537
00:30:21.252 --> 00:30:24.483
I don't remember what he said.
I don't remember what he told me.

538
00:30:24.556 --> 00:30:26.888
- I didn't ask anything important.
- You can ask now.

539
00:30:26.958 --> 00:30:28.391
I tried to ask now.

540
00:30:28.459 --> 00:30:30.825
I ended up having sex
on an Al Gilbert record.

541
00:30:30.895 --> 00:30:35.457
I need to know some things.
I need... I don't know what I need to do.

542
00:30:35.533 --> 00:30:37.660
- Maybe you should talk to Lorelai.
- No.

543
00:30:37.735 --> 00:30:39.999
- But she already knows about you guys.
- No.

544
00:30:40.071 --> 00:30:42.062
She's better than me at this sort of thing...

545
00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.971
because she at least has
a frame of reference.

546
00:30:44.042 --> 00:30:47.739
- Talking to her is not an option.
- Okay. Well, then...

547
00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.117
What do you think you're doing?

548
00:30:57.188 --> 00:30:59.452
- I told you she'd be mad.
- Get away from my drums!

549
00:30:59.524 --> 00:31:01.355
Well, you were in there talking
about pantyhose...

550
00:31:01.426 --> 00:31:02.859
or whatever the hell you chicks talk about.

551
00:31:02.927 --> 00:31:05.521
You do not, under any circumstances,
touch my drums!

552
00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:08.188
- He adjusted your seat also.
- You what?

553
00:31:09.667 --> 00:31:11.601
So, make sure they all get
the thank-you cards...

554
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:14.570
and light the lemon candles, so the rooms
smell pretty when they get up there.

555
00:31:14.639 --> 00:31:17.403
Thanks, and great job this weekend.
Great job.

556
00:31:25.416 --> 00:31:26.940
Oh! My God!

557
00:31:27.018 --> 00:31:29.543
- My, what a lovely greeting.
- How long have you been sitting there?

558
00:31:29.621 --> 00:31:31.612
- Ten minutes. Why?
- You scared me.

559
00:31:31.689 --> 00:31:34.123
- Like I'm Dracula.
- My God, my heart won't stop pounding.

560
00:31:34.192 --> 00:31:36.752
Stop being so dramatic.
I just showed up for lunch.

561
00:31:36.828 --> 00:31:39.228
It's not as if I did anything
truly terrifying...

562
00:31:39.297 --> 00:31:42.630
like telling you that butt-crack-baring
jeans have gone out of style.

563
00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.224
What do you mean,
you showed up for lunch?

564
00:31:44.302 --> 00:31:46.327
Our lunch at 1:00.

565
00:31:46.437 --> 00:31:48.098
You, me, Rory, the three of us.

566
00:31:48.172 --> 00:31:50.504
- We're having lunch, aren't we?
- I didn't think so.

567
00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:52.406
- You didn't?
- Well, no, but-

568
00:31:52.477 --> 00:31:54.570
When you invited your father and me
for the weekend...

569
00:31:54.646 --> 00:31:56.773
you said it included
a lunch with you and Rory.

570
00:31:56.848 --> 00:31:59.681
Well, yes, I know,
but that was before you left.

571
00:31:59.784 --> 00:32:01.581
What does my leaving have to do
with anything?

572
00:32:01.653 --> 00:32:04.417
Well, when you left,
you weren't here anymore.

573
00:32:04.489 --> 00:32:06.923
You were gone,
so we just assumed lunch was-

574
00:32:06.991 --> 00:32:09.255
- This lunch was your idea.
- Yes, I know, but-

575
00:32:09.327 --> 00:32:11.420
- I did not force it upon you.
- You're right, however-

576
00:32:11.496 --> 00:32:13.964
If you were too busy
or you didn't want it to happen...

577
00:32:14.032 --> 00:32:15.966
then you didn't have to bring it up at all,
did you?

578
00:32:16.034 --> 00:32:20.733
- No, I didn't, but you left, see?
- All right, then, it is now 1:00.

579
00:32:20.805 --> 00:32:24.241
You said lunch at 1:00, I'm here, it's 1:00,
I'm hungry. Where's Rory?

580
00:32:24.809 --> 00:32:28.575
- Okay, see, you left, so-
- She's not here, is she?

581
00:32:28.646 --> 00:32:30.671
- No.
- Didn't she know about the lunch?

582
00:32:30.748 --> 00:32:32.943
Yes, Mom,
she knew about the lunch, but you...

583
00:32:33.017 --> 00:32:35.281
So, we... And she...

584
00:32:36.988 --> 00:32:39.115
- I'll call her.
- I'll wait.

585
00:32:40.358 --> 00:32:41.347
What are you doing?

586
00:32:41.426 --> 00:32:42.757
They're drums, you're not out here.

587
00:32:42.827 --> 00:32:43.885
What are you talking about? Zach!

588
00:32:43.962 --> 00:32:46.021
How many times do I have to tell you
not to touch my things?

589
00:32:46.097 --> 00:32:48.258
We're a band! We share!

590
00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:50.631
- Hello?
- Your grandmother is here for her lunch.

591
00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:52.897
- But she left.
- Could you just get back here?

592
00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:55.735
- I'm kind of busy.
- Rory, this is not for me, okay?

593
00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:58.776
This is for your grandmother.
You like your grandmother, remember?

594
00:32:58.843 --> 00:33:00.071
- Fine.
- Great.

595
00:33:00.144 --> 00:33:03.113
- Bye.
- Chill! You're worse than Metallica!

596
00:33:07.218 --> 00:33:09.584
- I did that.
- Did you put in the meat thermometer?

597
00:33:09.654 --> 00:33:11.178
Yes, I put in the meat thermometer.

598
00:33:11.255 --> 00:33:14.486
I put in three meat thermometers
just in case one of them wasn't working.

599
00:33:14.559 --> 00:33:16.891
And you put the oven on 450
for 20 minutes...

600
00:33:16.961 --> 00:33:19.225
and then lowered it to 350
for the last hour?

601
00:33:19.297 --> 00:33:20.958
I did everything you told me.

602
00:33:21.032 --> 00:33:24.490
I did it exactly like you told me to,
and it still turned out awful.

603
00:33:24.569 --> 00:33:27.265
Maybe you should try something else,
meatloaf or chicken.

604
00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:30.239
No, Dean likes roast beef.
We had it at our wedding.

605
00:33:30.308 --> 00:33:32.299
His mother makes it
every time we go over there.

606
00:33:32.377 --> 00:33:35.346
I'm making dinner tonight,
and it has to be perfect.

607
00:33:36.014 --> 00:33:38.505
So just tell me how to do it again.

608
00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:40.210
- Okay.
- And write it down.

609
00:33:40.284 --> 00:33:44.186
Okay. First, you rub it with a little oil,
then take some fresh ground pepper...

610
00:33:56.801 --> 00:33:59.531
- The weather's lovely.
- Yes, it is.

611
00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:01.661
Rory, don't you think it's lovely?

612
00:34:01.806 --> 00:34:03.603
- It's very lovely.
- Yes.

613
00:34:05.977 --> 00:34:07.239
Lovely.

614
00:34:10.882 --> 00:34:13.407
Well, I don't see any reason
to put this off any longer.

615
00:34:13.484 --> 00:34:16.282
Girls, I have something to say
that may shock you.

616
00:34:16.554 --> 00:34:19.614
But unfortunately, there's nothing
I can do about that now.

617
00:34:20.058 --> 00:34:24.552
Lorelai, Rory,
Richard and I have separated.

618
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.493
- And?
- What do you mean "and"?

619
00:34:27.565 --> 00:34:30.966
That's not enough? You need some sort of
mob-related offing to make it interesting?

620
00:34:31.035 --> 00:34:32.969
No, Mom, that's plenty.
It's just we already knew.

621
00:34:33.037 --> 00:34:34.436
Rory didn't.

622
00:34:34.872 --> 00:34:37.932
Well, I mean, I didn't know know.

623
00:34:38.076 --> 00:34:39.668
- Why would you tell her?
- Mom!

624
00:34:39.744 --> 00:34:40.938
Who else did you tell?

625
00:34:41.012 --> 00:34:45.346
- So, you haven't read Page 6?
- Rory, if you need to talk about this...

626
00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:47.577
to try and understand
why this is happening...

627
00:34:47.652 --> 00:34:50.086
then by all means, do not ask your mother.

628
00:34:50.154 --> 00:34:52.850
Okay, Mom, I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to be insensitive.

629
00:34:52.924 --> 00:34:55.916
It just seemed like a thing
you and Dad were going through.

630
00:34:55.993 --> 00:34:57.984
- I figured you'd make up.
- Well, we didn't.

631
00:34:58.062 --> 00:35:01.793
I see that.
So, wow, you're really separated?

632
00:35:01.866 --> 00:35:04.562
That's right.
Your father's moving into the pool house.

633
00:35:04.635 --> 00:35:06.728
- So then, you're not separated.
- Of course we are.

634
00:35:06.804 --> 00:35:08.101
You're separated by the pool.

635
00:35:08.172 --> 00:35:10.732
That's it.
That's the end of your input on this.

636
00:35:10.808 --> 00:35:14.801
- I'm sorry, Grandma.
- Well, what's done is done. I'm moving on.

637
00:35:14.912 --> 00:35:18.439
And to celebrate the next stage of my life,
I'm going to Europe by myself...

638
00:35:18.516 --> 00:35:21.246
for the very first time
since I was in college.

639
00:35:21.486 --> 00:35:24.455
- I'm leaving tonight.
- Tonight? That's fast.

640
00:35:24.522 --> 00:35:28.583
Well, I wanted to leave quickly,
so I called my travel agent and insisted...

641
00:35:28.659 --> 00:35:31.651
that he put me on tonight's plane to Paris,
no matter what.

642
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:34.457
He finally managed to bump someone
from a church group...

643
00:35:34.532 --> 00:35:36.727
and I've got my seat,
and I'm leaving at 10:00.

644
00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:39.770
- And, Rory, my offer to you still stands.
- What offer?

645
00:35:39.837 --> 00:35:42.465
My offer to escort you
around Europe this summer.

646
00:35:43.107 --> 00:35:46.543
Every young lady should do Europe
the proper way at least once in her life...

647
00:35:46.611 --> 00:35:48.545
and I would be thrilled
to have your company...

648
00:35:48.613 --> 00:35:50.205
on this very special occasion.

649
00:35:50.281 --> 00:35:52.044
Of course, I know it's very short notice.

650
00:35:52.116 --> 00:35:53.913
So if you already have plans
for the summer...

651
00:35:53.985 --> 00:35:55.953
I completely understand.

652
00:35:56.154 --> 00:35:59.988
You know, I think Europe sounds great.
I think you would really enjoy that.

653
00:36:00.057 --> 00:36:01.786
Remember, we loved Paris.

654
00:36:01.859 --> 00:36:04.555
And you don't have anything special
planned for the summer, do you?

655
00:36:04.629 --> 00:36:07.564
- No, nothing special.
- Well, then, what do you say?

656
00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:12.368
- Would you like to be impulsive with me?
- Sure, Grandma, I'd love to.

657
00:36:12.436 --> 00:36:14.597
That is just wonderful!

658
00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:18.231
I'll call Ralphie right away
and tell him to bump another Baptist.

659
00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:22.040
We'll have a wonderful time, you and I.
It'll be just like Gigi.

660
00:36:22.446 --> 00:36:25.074
- Lorelai, I'm gonna use your phone.
- Be my guest, Mom.

661
00:36:30.454 --> 00:36:31.648
Europe?

662
00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:33.448
Cool.

663
00:36:35.526 --> 00:36:38.017
- What?
- So, what is this, a Henry James novel?

664
00:36:38.095 --> 00:36:41.258
The young lady acts up,
and her family ships her off to Europe?

665
00:36:41.332 --> 00:36:42.356
Come on.

666
00:36:42.433 --> 00:36:44.924
How fast did you tell Grandma
that I had nothing to do this summer?

667
00:36:45.002 --> 00:36:47.095
- I'm not shipping you off.
- Oh, please.

668
00:36:47.171 --> 00:36:50.732
I'm not. I'm just... Okay, maybe I am.

669
00:36:51.275 --> 00:36:52.640
I wasn't planning on it...

670
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:55.304
but maybe somewhere in the back
of my mind, I just thought-

671
00:36:55.379 --> 00:36:56.869
Say goodbye to Daisy Miller.

672
00:36:56.948 --> 00:36:59.815
Okay, fine, so maybe I suggested
the trip to give you some time to-

673
00:36:59.884 --> 00:37:01.511
Travel back to the turn of the century?

674
00:37:01.586 --> 00:37:04.180
To think. But you did not have to accept.

675
00:37:04.255 --> 00:37:06.849
- I did, too.
- No, Rory, you didn't.

676
00:37:06.924 --> 00:37:08.391
You're 19 now, remember?

677
00:37:08.459 --> 00:37:12.122
You're all grown up,
and you can handle your own affairs.

678
00:37:12.196 --> 00:37:13.788
Sorry. That's a bad choice of words.

679
00:37:13.864 --> 00:37:17.197
You can handle your own life events,
so if you didn't want to go to Europe...

680
00:37:17.268 --> 00:37:19.133
all you had to do
was say you didn't want to go...

681
00:37:19.203 --> 00:37:22.195
but you didn't,
so I assume you do want to go.

682
00:37:23.541 --> 00:37:27.068
You do want to go? How come?

683
00:37:27.378 --> 00:37:30.472
I mean, what about Dean?
You're just gonna go off and leave now?

684
00:37:30.548 --> 00:37:32.743
- None of your business.
- Did something happen?

685
00:37:32.817 --> 00:37:34.978
Did you guys have a fight,
or is it something else?

686
00:37:35.052 --> 00:37:36.041
Is it Lindsay?

687
00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.179
We didn't fight.
Everything is fine with Dean.

688
00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:40.087
I want to go so I can get away from you.

689
00:37:40.558 --> 00:37:42.992
I'm sorry. Weren't you supposed
to go through this phase...

690
00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:46.223
like five years ago?
'Cause, I mean, seriously, at this point...

691
00:37:46.297 --> 00:37:49.323
storming into your room
and blasting your Goth rock...

692
00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.426
- it's just gonna confuse your roommates.
- Tell Grandma I had to pack.

693
00:39:07.545 --> 00:39:10.708
Come on, girls, hurry up.
We have an adventure to embark on.

694
00:39:10.781 --> 00:39:13.147
There you go.
My picture ID and my boarding pass.

695
00:39:13.217 --> 00:39:14.514
Rory, hurry up.

696
00:39:14.585 --> 00:39:17.577
You have to hold your own boarding pass
and you need your ID.

697
00:39:17.655 --> 00:39:19.247
Lorelai, say your goodbyes here.

698
00:39:19.323 --> 00:39:22.588
If you don't have a boarding pass,
you can't go any farther, am I right?

699
00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.059
I'm right, Lorelai.

700
00:39:24.128 --> 00:39:27.495
If you need to search me, that's just fine.
Don't be afraid to ask.

701
00:39:27.565 --> 00:39:29.533
- Bye, Lorelai.
- Bye, Mom.

702
00:39:30.334 --> 00:39:32.564
Hold on a sec.
You have everything you need?

703
00:39:33.003 --> 00:39:36.370
- You have trashy-magazine money?
- Those magazines make Grandma crazy.

704
00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.000
Yeah, well, here's $20. It's a long flight.

705
00:39:39.844 --> 00:39:42.836
- Rory, hurry, please.
- Coming, Grandma.

706
00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:46.240
- I have to go.
- Yeah, you do. Okay, so...

707
00:39:48.085 --> 00:39:49.950
have fun, and...

708
00:39:52.022 --> 00:39:55.651
if you need to talk about anything,
just please call me, okay?

709
00:39:57.695 --> 00:39:58.787
Okay.

710
00:40:17.181 --> 00:40:20.514
Hey, it's me.
Listen, I got a call from my sister and T.J.

711
00:40:20.584 --> 00:40:22.984
They're up in Maine,
and they got into a little accident.

712
00:40:23.053 --> 00:40:25.988
Nothing major, just each one of them
broke an arm and a leg.

713
00:40:26.056 --> 00:40:28.354
So anyhow, they can't run
the Renaissance Faire booth...

714
00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:29.893
for a couple of weeks.

715
00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.190
So they asked me to come help them out.

716
00:40:32.263 --> 00:40:35.391
And I, unfortunately, answered the phone,
so I'm on my way to Maine.

717
00:40:35.466 --> 00:40:37.627
I'll be back in about a week.

718
00:40:37.701 --> 00:40:38.929
Okay? Bye.

719
00:40:39.003 --> 00:40:40.197
Great.

720
00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:42.038
Hey. It's me again.

721
00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:44.404
I'm not sure if we're at the point
in this relationship...

722
00:40:44.475 --> 00:40:46.375
where you actually need to know
that much information...

723
00:40:46.444 --> 00:40:48.708
about my whereabouts,
so if we're not, I'm sorry.

724
00:40:48.779 --> 00:40:52.146
I could have just said
I'm going out of town and I'll call you later.

725
00:40:52.216 --> 00:40:54.844
So, I'm going out of town,
and I'll call you later.

726
00:40:55.753 --> 00:40:57.277
Me again, the idiot that leaves you...

727
00:40:57.354 --> 00:40:59.879
three rambling messages
on your machine.

728
00:40:59.957 --> 00:41:02.926
I just wanted to tell you
I got a cell phone before I left.

729
00:41:02.993 --> 00:41:06.724
So, you know, you could call if you want,
but only if you want.

730
00:41:06.797 --> 00:41:08.321
So, that's it.

731
00:41:09.733 --> 00:41:12.167
- Yeah, a number might be good.
- Thank you.

732
00:41:12.269 --> 00:41:14.737
860-294-1986.

733
00:41:15.439 --> 00:41:16.770
Okay, bye.

734
00:41:17.675 --> 00:41:22.339
Just don't change your mind
until I get back, okay?

735
00:41:22.947 --> 00:41:25.211
Okay. Talk to you later.

736
00:41:37.862 --> 00:41:40.729
- Hello?
- Well, if it isn't Dean Moriarty.

737
00:41:40.831 --> 00:41:42.492
Yeah, this is the life.

738
00:41:42.566 --> 00:41:44.227
So, are Liz and T.J. okay?

739
00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:46.201
Yeah, they're just not
getting around too well.

740
00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:49.296
Liz is all panicked
that if they don't finish out the season...

741
00:41:49.373 --> 00:41:51.967
they're gonna lose their spot
next to the apple doll booth...

742
00:41:52.042 --> 00:41:54.806
which is apparently the prime spot,
so I said I'd help them out.

743
00:41:54.879 --> 00:41:56.176
Very chivalrous of you.

744
00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:59.478
Yeah, I'm a regular Lancelot.
So, you get my messages?

745
00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:01.415
No, did you leave a message?

746
00:42:01.485 --> 00:42:04.283
Sorry, my answering machine
dropped dead of exhaustion.

747
00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:06.050
- What did you say?
- Not much.

748
00:42:06.123 --> 00:42:07.215
Okay.

749
00:42:08.993 --> 00:42:10.255
So...

750
00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:12.085
So...

751
00:42:12.162 --> 00:42:13.823
That was a hell of a test run.

752
00:42:13.898 --> 00:42:15.297
You mean for the inn, of course.

753
00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:17.129
- Of course.
- Yes, it was.

754
00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:20.034
Although, until you have
a successful second go round...

755
00:42:20.104 --> 00:42:22.231
you really don't know
if everything's gonna work.

756
00:42:22.306 --> 00:42:24.171
Then I guess there's got to be
a second go round.

757
00:42:24.241 --> 00:42:27.677
Yes, it's the only thing
that makes really good business sense.

758
00:42:27.745 --> 00:42:29.679
So, where are you right now?

759
00:42:29.747 --> 00:42:31.009
About 10 minutes from...

760
00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:33.311
"If I lived here, I'd blow my brains out. "

761
00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:36.148
Yes, I hear it's lovely
there this time of year.

762
00:43:17.361 --> 00:43:18.350
English
