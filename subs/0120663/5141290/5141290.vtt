00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:04.690
Honey, have you seen my wallet?

3
00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:08.443
Isn't it on the bedside table?

4
00:01:14.992 --> 00:01:17.494
Now listen, we're running a little late.

5
00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:18.745
I know.

6
00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:20.831
How do I look?

7
00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:22.499
Perfect.

8
00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.418
Is my hair okay?

9
00:01:24.877 --> 00:01:26.044
It's great.

10
00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:28.338
You're not even looking at it.

11
00:01:29.548 --> 00:01:31.008
It's beautiful.

12
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:33.135
You always look beautiful.

13
00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:35.679
Did you give Roz the phone
and pager numbers?

14
00:01:35.888 --> 00:01:38.348
Yeah, I put it on the fridge.
Let's go.

15
00:01:38.557 --> 00:01:39.558
Coming.

16
00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:42.019
All right.

17
00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:43.478
I'm ready.

18
00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.206
What's the babysitter's name?

19
00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:03.332
Roz.

20
00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:08.754
Okay, Roz, we're going now.

21
00:02:09.338 --> 00:02:11.798
You look amazing, Mrs. Harford.

22
00:02:11.924 --> 00:02:14.301
Thank you.
Helena, are you ready for bed?

23
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:17.137
Yes, Mommy. Can I stay up
and watch The Nutcracker?

24
00:02:17.346 --> 00:02:19.264
- What time's it on?
- 9:00.

25
00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:22.100
- You can watch that.
- Can I stay up until you get home?

26
00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:25.395
- No, darling.
- It'll be a little late for that.

27
00:02:25.604 --> 00:02:27.814
The phone number is on the fridge...

28
00:02:28.065 --> 00:02:30.776
and there's food in there,
so help yourself.

29
00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:32.736
We shouldn't be later than 1:00.

30
00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:35.656
- I'll hold our cab to take you home.
- Thanks, Dr. Harford.

31
00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:37.241
You be good, baby.

32
00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:40.869
- Good night, sweetheart.
- See you in the morning.

33
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.423
- Victor, Illona.
- Bill, Alice.

34
00:02:53.632 --> 00:02:56.176
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you for coming.

35
00:02:56.552 --> 00:03:01.014
- Thanks so much for coming.
- We wouldn't miss it for the world.

36
00:03:01.223 --> 00:03:04.309
Alice, look at you.
God, you're absolutely stunning!

37
00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:06.436
I don't say that to all the women.
Do I?

38
00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:08.397
- Yes, he does.
- He does?

39
00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:11.608
That osteopath you sent me to,
the guy that worked on my arm?

40
00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:15.195
- You ought to see my serve now.
- He's the top man in New York.

41
00:03:15.404 --> 00:03:17.906
I could have told you that,
looking at his bill.

42
00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:20.534
Go inside, have a drink,
enjoy the party.

43
00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:23.453
I'll see you in a little bit.
Thanks for coming.

44
00:03:36.425 --> 00:03:38.468
Do you know anyone here?

45
00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:42.306
Not a soul.

46
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.610
Why do you think Ziegler invites us
to these things every year?

47
00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.199
This is what you get
for making house calls.

48
00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:13.587
You see that guy at the piano?

49
00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:17.216
I went to medical school with him.

50
00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:18.884
Really?

51
00:04:22.179 --> 00:04:24.640
He plays pretty good for a doctor.

52
00:04:25.474 --> 00:04:29.019
He's not a doctor. He dropped out.

53
00:04:32.064 --> 00:04:34.608
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hope you're enjoying yourselves.

54
00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:38.153
The band's going to take a break.
We'll be back in 10 minutes.

55
00:04:38.946 --> 00:04:39.988
Thank you.

56
00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:49.081
Let's go over and say hello.

57
00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:51.708
I desperately need to go 
to the bathroom.

58
00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:55.838
You go and say hello, 
and meet you where? At the bar?

59
00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:57.381
Good.

60
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.393
Nightingale.

61
00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:11.353
Nick Nightingale!

62
00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:13.897
Oh, my God! Bill.

63
00:05:14.398 --> 00:05:17.192
Bill Harford!
How the hell are you, buddy?

64
00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:20.946
- How long has it been?
- I don't know. 10 years?

65
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:22.489
And a couple.

66
00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:24.908
- Do you have time for a drink?
- Sure.

67
00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:31.165
You haven't changed a bit.

68
00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:34.251
Thanks, I think.
So how you doing?

69
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:37.171
Not too bad, you know. 
Not too bad.

70
00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.673
I see you've become a pianist.

71
00:05:39.882 --> 00:05:42.426
Oh, yes, well, my friends call me that.

72
00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.888
How about you?
You still in the doctor business?

73
00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:50.142
You know what they say:
"Once a doctor, always a doctor."

74
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.646
Yes, or in my case:
"Never a doctor, never a doctor."

75
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.900
I never did understand
why you walked away.

76
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.986
It's a nice feeling. I do it a lot.

77
00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:02.404
Cheers.

78
00:06:02.988 --> 00:06:06.408
Excuse me.
Nick, I need you a minute.

79
00:06:06.617 --> 00:06:08.243
Be right with you.

80
00:06:08.452 --> 00:06:11.121
I gotta go do something.
If I don't catch you later...

81
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.125
I'll be down at the Village for two weeks 
at the Sonata CafÃ©.

82
00:06:15.334 --> 00:06:18.003
- Stop by if you get a chance.
- I'll be there.

83
00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:21.798
- It's great seeing you.
- Good seeing you too, man.

84
00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:06.718
I think that's my glass.

85
00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:10.055
I'm absolutely certain of it.

86
00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:28.073
My name is Sandor Szavost.
I'm Hungarian.

87
00:07:38.709 --> 00:07:41.128
My name is Alice Harford.

88
00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.505
I'm American.

89
00:07:44.173 --> 00:07:46.091
Delighted to meet you, Alice.

90
00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:52.431
Did you ever read the Latin poet Ovid
on The Art of Love?

91
00:07:54.558 --> 00:07:58.187
Didn't he wind up all by himself...?

92
00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:01.148
Crying his eyes out...

93
00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:05.110
in some place with a very bad climate?

94
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.239
But he also had a good time first.

95
00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:12.034
A very good time.

96
00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:17.289
Are you here with anyone tonight, Alice?

97
00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:22.419
With my husband.

98
00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:24.671
Oh, how sad.

99
00:08:25.464 --> 00:08:30.344
But then I'm sure he's the sort of man
who wouldn't mind if we danced.

100
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.351
What do you do, Alice?

101
00:08:37.893 --> 00:08:41.313
Well, at the moment...

102
00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:44.441
I'm looking for a job.

103
00:08:45.609 --> 00:08:49.404
I used to manage an art gallery in Soho.

104
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.157
But it went broke.

105
00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:55.869
What a shame.

106
00:08:57.579 --> 00:09:00.082
I have some friends in the art game.

107
00:09:00.791 --> 00:09:03.001
Perhaps I can be of some help.

108
00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:08.423
Thank you.

109
00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:29.236
Someone you know?

110
00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:34.783
My...

111
00:09:35.284 --> 00:09:36.785
husband.

112
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.543
Don't you think 
one of the charms of marriage...

113
00:09:44.835 --> 00:09:49.381
is that it makes deception
a necessity for both parties?

114
00:09:53.302 --> 00:09:55.929
May I ask why a beautiful woman...

115
00:09:56.471 --> 00:10:00.142
who could have any man in  this room, 
wants to be married?

116
00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:05.063
Why wouldn't she?

117
00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:08.984
Is it as bad as that?

118
00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:12.571
As good as that.

119
00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:15.157
Do you know Nuala Windsor?

120
00:10:15.282 --> 00:10:19.995
No, and it's very lovely
to meet you both.

121
00:10:21.914 --> 00:10:23.999
How do you spell Nuala?

122
00:10:24.583 --> 00:10:29.546
N-U-A-L-A.

123
00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:34.009
You don't remember me, do you?

124
00:10:35.219 --> 00:10:37.763
You were very kind to me once.

125
00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:41.725
Only once?
That sounds like a terrible oversight!

126
00:10:43.185 --> 00:10:47.397
I was doing a photo session
in Rockefeller Plaza...

127
00:10:47.606 --> 00:10:49.191
on a very windy day...?

128
00:10:49.358 --> 00:10:53.612
- And you got something in your eye.
- Just about half of Fifth Avenue.

129
00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:57.533
You were such a gentleman!
You gave me your handkerchief...

130
00:10:57.699 --> 00:11:00.244
which was also clean.

131
00:11:01.912 --> 00:11:05.624
That is the kind of hero
I can be sometimes.

132
00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:09.711
You know why women used to get married,
don't you?

133
00:11:11.255 --> 00:11:13.465
Why don't you tell me?

134
00:11:15.217 --> 00:11:18.178
It was the only way they could lose 
their virginity...

135
00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:22.182
and be free to do what they wanted 
with other men.

136
00:11:23.225 --> 00:11:25.435
The ones they really wanted.

137
00:11:30.107 --> 00:11:32.109
Fascinating.

138
00:11:36.071 --> 00:11:39.825
Do you know what's so nice about doctors?

139
00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:44.955
Usually a lot less than people imagine.

140
00:11:46.665 --> 00:11:49.293
They always seem so...

141
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.753
knowledgeable.

142
00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:56.592
Oh, they are very knowledgeable...

143
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.678
about all sorts of things.

144
00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:03.765
But I bet they work too hard.

145
00:12:04.266 --> 00:12:08.061
Just think of all they miss.

146
00:12:08.979 --> 00:12:11.315
You're probably right.

147
00:12:12.316 --> 00:12:17.112
Ladies, where exactly are we going?

148
00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:19.323
Exactly?

149
00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:24.328
Where the rainbow ends.

150
00:12:24.912 --> 00:12:26.788
Where the rainbow ends?

151
00:12:26.997 --> 00:12:30.459
Don't you want to go
where the rainbow ends?

152
00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:33.754
Now that depends where that is.

153
00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:35.631
Well, let's find out.

154
00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:38.675
Excuse me, ladies.
Sorry, Dr. Harford.

155
00:12:38.926 --> 00:12:43.180
Could you come with me for a moment?
Something for Mr. Ziegler.

156
00:12:45.516 --> 00:12:46.683
Fine.

157
00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:49.853
To be continued?

158
00:13:12.668 --> 00:13:14.753
Bill, thanks for coming.

159
00:13:16.755 --> 00:13:19.633
We had a little accident here.

160
00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:21.385
What happened?

161
00:13:21.927 --> 00:13:23.846
Well, she was...

162
00:13:24.346 --> 00:13:28.517
She was shooting up
and she had a bad reaction.

163
00:13:30.352 --> 00:13:31.520
What did she take?

164
00:13:32.646 --> 00:13:36.024
A speedball or a snowball
or whatever the hell they call it.

165
00:13:36.233 --> 00:13:38.068
It's heroin and coke.

166
00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:43.031
Heroin and coke?

167
00:13:45.534 --> 00:13:46.869
Anything else?

168
00:13:48.537 --> 00:13:51.790
We had a couple of drinks, 
some champagne. That was it.

169
00:13:52.249 --> 00:13:53.959
How long has she been like this?

170
00:13:54.418 --> 00:13:57.629
Maybe five minutes, six minutes,
something like that.

171
00:13:57.838 --> 00:13:58.964
What's her name?

172
00:14:00.257 --> 00:14:01.341
Mandy.

173
00:14:10.893 --> 00:14:12.769
Can you hear me, Mandy?

174
00:14:14.229 --> 00:14:17.733
Can you hear me?
Move your head if you can hear me.

175
00:14:19.234 --> 00:14:22.321
Move your head if you can hear me, Mandy. 
There you go.

176
00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:24.114
You can hear me.

177
00:14:24.323 --> 00:14:28.535
Can you open your eyes for me?
Mandy, can you do that?

178
00:14:29.244 --> 00:14:32.581
Let me see you open your eyes.
There you go, come on.

179
00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:35.792
Come on, look at me. 
Look at me.

180
00:14:36.335 --> 00:14:38.837
Look at me. Look at me.

181
00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:42.758
Look at me. 
Look at me, Mandy.

182
00:14:44.468 --> 00:14:45.427
Good.

183
00:14:46.929 --> 00:14:48.305
Good.

184
00:14:50.224 --> 00:14:53.560
I love Victor's art collection,
don't you?

185
00:14:57.481 --> 00:14:59.358
It's wonderful.

186
00:15:00.901 --> 00:15:03.862
Have you ever seen his sculpture gallery?

187
00:15:08.158 --> 00:15:09.868
I haven't.

188
00:15:10.661 --> 00:15:15.457
He has a wonderful collection
of Renaissance bronzes.

189
00:15:17.668 --> 00:15:19.795
Do you like the period?

190
00:15:23.006 --> 00:15:24.675
I do.

191
00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.469
I adore it.

192
00:15:29.555 --> 00:15:32.015
The sculpture gallery is upstairs.

193
00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:35.477
Would you like to see it?

194
00:15:38.564 --> 00:15:40.357
I can show it to you.

195
00:15:43.944 --> 00:15:45.863
We won't be gone long.

196
00:15:53.287 --> 00:15:55.080
Maybe...

197
00:15:57.749 --> 00:16:00.878
not just...

198
00:16:02.045 --> 00:16:03.463
now.

199
00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:25.777
That was really one hell of a scare 
you gave us, kiddo.

200
00:16:27.362 --> 00:16:28.697
Sorry.

201
00:16:37.748 --> 00:16:39.833
How are you feeling now, Mandy?

202
00:16:41.877 --> 00:16:43.003
Better.

203
00:16:52.638 --> 00:16:57.059
You are a very, very lucky girl.

204
00:16:58.185 --> 00:16:59.603
You know that?

205
00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:03.440
I know.

206
00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:06.777
You're gonna be okay this time.

207
00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:11.281
But you can't keep doing this.

208
00:17:12.074 --> 00:17:13.534
You understand?

209
00:17:17.955 --> 00:17:21.875
You're going to need some rehab.
You know that, don't you?

210
00:17:23.627 --> 00:17:25.254
I know.

211
00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:37.641
Well, Victor...

212
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.395
I'll leave the rest to you.

213
00:17:41.562 --> 00:17:44.314
Is it okay if I dress her
and get her out of here?

214
00:17:44.523 --> 00:17:48.235
No, I'd keep her here for another hour.

215
00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:49.903
Another hour?

216
00:17:51.613 --> 00:17:54.825
Then have someone take her home.

217
00:18:00.873 --> 00:18:02.374
Good night, Mandy.

218
00:18:05.294 --> 00:18:07.504
I can't thank you enough for this.

219
00:18:08.255 --> 00:18:10.507
- You saved my ass.
- I'm glad I was here.

220
00:18:10.674 --> 00:18:13.135
Bill, I probably... 

221
00:18:13.969 --> 00:18:17.472
I know I don't have to mention this...

222
00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:20.642
but this is just between us.

223
00:18:21.185 --> 00:18:22.394
Of course.

224
00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:24.146
Thanks.

225
00:18:45.209 --> 00:18:49.796
I think I've had 
a little too much champagne.

226
00:18:52.925 --> 00:18:56.553
I think I have to go
and find my husband now.

227
00:18:56.762 --> 00:19:01.391
But I'm sure he'll be all right 
on his own a little longer.

228
00:19:03.936 --> 00:19:05.312
Yes...

229
00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.357
but will I?

230
00:19:09.024 --> 00:19:10.692
Of course you will.

231
00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:19.701
I really have to go.
I have to go.

232
00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:21.703
You don't, you know.

233
00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:26.041
Yes, I do.

234
00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:33.215
I must see you again.

235
00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.636
- That's impossible.
- Why?

236
00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:40.848
Because...

237
00:19:43.392 --> 00:19:45.727
I'm married.

238
00:20:50.584 --> 00:20:52.044
Good morning, Lisa.

239
00:20:52.294 --> 00:20:54.379
Good morning, doctor.
Your mail.

240
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:57.508
Good. Please ask Janelle
to bring me my coffee.

241
00:20:57.758 --> 00:20:59.343
- Sure.
- Thank you.

242
00:20:59.927 --> 00:21:02.888
- Good morning, Sarah.
- Good morning, doctor.

243
00:21:03.138 --> 00:21:06.183
<i>It was the night before Christmas,
when all through the house...</i>

244
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.228
<i>not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse.</i>

245
00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.984
Okay. That's fine.
You can put your gown on.

246
00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:22.407
Hold this for Mommy.

247
00:21:24.034 --> 00:21:25.786
Looking forward to Christmas?

248
00:21:26.829 --> 00:21:28.622
Does this hurt?

249
00:21:42.928 --> 00:21:44.221
Right there?

250
00:21:55.148 --> 00:21:57.067
Daddy's gonna like that.

251
00:21:57.776 --> 00:21:59.528
Very good choice.

252
00:22:00.279 --> 00:22:02.614
"Before me...

253
00:22:03.073 --> 00:22:08.078
when I jump into my bed."

254
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:14.251
We should call the Zieglers
and thank them for the party last night.

255
00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.087
I've taken care of that.

256
00:22:18.672 --> 00:22:20.048
Good.

257
00:22:20.924 --> 00:22:24.386
So how do you feel about wrapping
the rest of the presents?

258
00:22:26.096 --> 00:22:28.265
Let's do that tomorrow.

259
00:23:14.353 --> 00:23:16.480
Tell me something.

260
00:23:21.235 --> 00:23:24.738
Those two girls...

261
00:23:26.573 --> 00:23:29.201
at the party last night... 

262
00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.042
Did you...

263
00:23:38.043 --> 00:23:40.420
by any chance...

264
00:23:40.796 --> 00:23:43.131
happen to...

265
00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.594
fuck them?

266
00:23:50.222 --> 00:23:51.557
What?

267
00:23:54.518 --> 00:23:57.145
What are you talking about?

268
00:24:01.149 --> 00:24:04.820
I'm talking about the two girls...

269
00:24:05.112 --> 00:24:08.991
that you were so blatantly hitting on.

270
00:24:10.617 --> 00:24:13.745
I wasn't hitting on anybody.

271
00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.792
Who were they?

272
00:24:22.087 --> 00:24:25.757
They were just a couple of models.

273
00:24:29.803 --> 00:24:34.349
And where did you disappear to 
with them for so long?

274
00:24:34.558 --> 00:24:36.518
Wait a minute.

275
00:24:40.939 --> 00:24:44.902
I didn't disappear with anybody.

276
00:24:47.696 --> 00:24:50.324
Ziegler wasn't feeling too well...

277
00:24:51.158 --> 00:24:54.036
and I got called upstairs to see him.

278
00:24:57.831 --> 00:25:00.792
Anyway, who was the guy
you were dancing with?

279
00:25:06.924 --> 00:25:09.843
A friend of the Zieglers.

280
00:25:12.554 --> 00:25:13.931
What did he want?

281
00:25:14.223 --> 00:25:16.225
What did he want?

282
00:25:22.981 --> 00:25:24.566
Sex...

283
00:25:26.652 --> 00:25:28.570
upstairs.

284
00:25:29.655 --> 00:25:31.532
Then and there.

285
00:25:33.951 --> 00:25:35.494
Is that all?

286
00:25:35.911 --> 00:25:38.413
Yeah, that was all.

287
00:25:38.622 --> 00:25:41.416
Just wanted to fuck my wife.

288
00:25:45.712 --> 00:25:47.256
That's right.

289
00:25:47.589 --> 00:25:49.883
Well, I guess that's understandable.

290
00:25:52.886 --> 00:25:55.055
Understandable?

291
00:25:55.931 --> 00:25:58.100
Because you are a very...

292
00:25:59.142 --> 00:26:01.311
very beautiful woman.

293
00:26:04.398 --> 00:26:05.774
Wait.

294
00:26:09.778 --> 00:26:11.446
Because I'm a beautiful woman...

295
00:26:11.655 --> 00:26:15.951
the only reason any man
ever wants to talk to me...

296
00:26:17.828 --> 00:26:22.166
is because he wants to fuck me.
Is that what you're saying?

297
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:29.631
Well, I don't think it's quite
that black and white...

298
00:26:31.925 --> 00:26:36.638
but I think we both know
what men are like.

299
00:26:38.807 --> 00:26:40.642
So on that basis...

300
00:26:40.851 --> 00:26:45.856
I should conclude that you wanted 
to fuck those two models.

301
00:26:47.774 --> 00:26:50.819
There are exceptions.

302
00:26:52.487 --> 00:26:56.366
And what makes you an exception?

303
00:26:59.119 --> 00:27:02.789
What makes me an exception is that...

304
00:27:03.999 --> 00:27:06.460
I happen to be in love with you.

305
00:27:07.544 --> 00:27:09.129
And because we're married...

306
00:27:09.338 --> 00:27:13.634
and because I would never lie to you...

307
00:27:14.301 --> 00:27:15.886
or hurt you.

308
00:27:23.852 --> 00:27:27.606
Do you realize that what you're saying...

309
00:27:27.856 --> 00:27:31.193
is that the only reason 
you wouldn't fuck those two models...

310
00:27:31.401 --> 00:27:33.987
is out of consideration for me?

311
00:27:34.196 --> 00:27:37.241
Not because you really wouldn't want to.

312
00:27:37.658 --> 00:27:40.369
Let's just relax, Alice.

313
00:27:40.577 --> 00:27:43.163
This pot is making you aggressive.

314
00:27:43.413 --> 00:27:46.792
No! It's not the pot. It's you!

315
00:27:47.042 --> 00:27:49.628
Why can't you ever give me
a straight fucking answer?

316
00:27:49.837 --> 00:27:52.422
I was under the impression
that's what I was doing.

317
00:27:52.631 --> 00:27:55.843
I don't even know 
what we're arguing about here.

318
00:27:56.051 --> 00:27:58.262
I'm not arguing.

319
00:27:58.971 --> 00:28:03.517
I'm just trying to find out
where you're coming from.

320
00:28:03.892 --> 00:28:05.477
Where I'm coming from?

321
00:28:10.023 --> 00:28:14.653
Let's say, for example,
you have some gorgeous woman...

322
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:18.991
standing in your office naked...

323
00:28:19.199 --> 00:28:21.869
and you're feeling her fucking tits.

324
00:28:22.077 --> 00:28:23.871
Now, what I want to know... 

325
00:28:24.079 --> 00:28:29.084
I want to know what you're thinking about 
when you're squeezing them.

326
00:28:29.418 --> 00:28:33.422
Alice, I happen to be a doctor.

327
00:28:34.173 --> 00:28:36.216
It's all very impersonal...

328
00:28:36.425 --> 00:28:40.012
and you know there's always a nurse present.

329
00:28:40.637 --> 00:28:45.434
So when you're feeling tits, 
it's nothing more than your professionalism?

330
00:28:45.642 --> 00:28:46.685
Exactly.

331
00:28:46.894 --> 00:28:51.440
Sex is the last thing on my mind
when I'm with a patient.

332
00:28:52.774 --> 00:28:56.904
Now, when she is having
her little titties squeezed...

333
00:28:57.112 --> 00:28:59.364
do you think she ever has fantasies...

334
00:28:59.573 --> 00:29:03.869
about what handsome Dr. Bill's dickie 
might be like?

335
00:29:05.954 --> 00:29:10.250
Come on, I can assure you
sex is the last thing...

336
00:29:10.501 --> 00:29:14.713
on this fucking hypothetical
woman patient's mind.

337
00:29:14.963 --> 00:29:16.840
And what makes you so sure?

338
00:29:21.803 --> 00:29:23.889
If for no better reason...

339
00:29:24.431 --> 00:29:27.392
because she's afraid of what I might find.

340
00:29:29.311 --> 00:29:33.065
So after you tell her 
that everything's fine, what then?

341
00:29:33.899 --> 00:29:35.526
What then?

342
00:29:36.944 --> 00:29:39.154
I don't know, Alice... 

343
00:29:40.697 --> 00:29:41.990
What then?

344
00:29:45.327 --> 00:29:47.830
Women don't... 

345
00:29:48.997 --> 00:29:52.543
They basically just don't think like that.

346
00:29:54.837 --> 00:29:58.382
Millions of years of evolution, right?

347
00:30:00.259 --> 00:30:02.678
Men have to stick it
every place they can...

348
00:30:02.886 --> 00:30:06.098
but for women, it is just 
about security and commitment...

349
00:30:06.515 --> 00:30:08.559
and whatever the fuck else!

350
00:30:08.851 --> 00:30:12.521
A little oversimplified, Alice.
But yes, something like that.

351
00:30:13.063 --> 00:30:16.692
If you men only knew.

352
00:30:18.026 --> 00:30:22.197
What I do know is you got stoned,
you tried to pick a fight...

353
00:30:22.406 --> 00:30:25.534
and now you're trying
to make me jealous.

354
00:30:25.742 --> 00:30:27.870
But you're not the jealous type,
are you?

355
00:30:28.078 --> 00:30:29.246
No, I'm not.

356
00:30:29.454 --> 00:30:31.540
You've never been jealous about me,
have you?

357
00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:32.749
No, I haven't.

358
00:30:32.958 --> 00:30:35.460
And why haven't you 
ever been jealous about me?

359
00:30:35.711 --> 00:30:39.631
Well, I don't know, Alice.
Maybe because you're my wife.

360
00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:42.217
Maybe because you're the mother 
of my child...

361
00:30:42.426 --> 00:30:45.220
and I know you would never be 
unfaithful to me.

362
00:30:45.429 --> 00:30:49.725
You are very, very sure of yourself...

363
00:30:49.933 --> 00:30:51.226
aren't you?

364
00:30:51.768 --> 00:30:52.895
No.

365
00:30:53.729 --> 00:30:55.397
I'm sure of you.

366
00:31:07.701 --> 00:31:09.536
Do you think that's funny?

367
00:31:18.545 --> 00:31:20.255
All right. Fuck it.

368
00:31:21.006 --> 00:31:24.843
Now we get the fucking 
laughing fit, right?

369
00:31:36.396 --> 00:31:37.773
Do you... 

370
00:31:39.942 --> 00:31:43.612
Do you remember last summer 
at Cape Cod?

371
00:31:50.536 --> 00:31:53.622
Do you remember one night
in the dining room...

372
00:31:53.831 --> 00:31:55.999
there was this young naval officer...

373
00:31:56.208 --> 00:32:00.796
and he was sitting near our table
with two other officers?

374
00:32:02.297 --> 00:32:03.340
No.

375
00:32:06.093 --> 00:32:10.180
The waiter brought him a message,
at which point he left.

376
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:13.058
Nothing rings a bell?

377
00:32:19.773 --> 00:32:21.024
Well...

378
00:32:22.985 --> 00:32:27.030
I first saw him that morning 
in the lobby.

379
00:32:27.823 --> 00:32:30.492
He was checking into the hotel...

380
00:32:30.742 --> 00:32:34.246
and he was following the bellboy
with his luggage...

381
00:32:34.913 --> 00:32:36.915
to the elevator.

382
00:32:41.461 --> 00:32:45.841
He glanced at me as he walked past.
Just a glance.

383
00:32:47.092 --> 00:32:48.844
Nothing more.

384
00:32:56.185 --> 00:32:59.313
But I could hardly...

385
00:33:00.981 --> 00:33:02.524
move.

386
00:33:11.033 --> 00:33:13.744
That afternoon...

387
00:33:16.038 --> 00:33:20.083
Helena went to the movies
with her friend...

388
00:33:23.587 --> 00:33:25.964
and you and I made love.

389
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:33.555
And we made plans about our future...

390
00:33:34.723 --> 00:33:38.727
and we talked about Helena.

391
00:33:40.479 --> 00:33:42.105
And yet...

392
00:33:43.232 --> 00:33:45.943
at no time...

393
00:33:47.236 --> 00:33:49.863
was he ever...

394
00:33:50.989 --> 00:33:54.827
out of my mind.

395
00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:05.170
And I thought if he wanted me...

396
00:34:06.797 --> 00:34:09.508
even if it was only...

397
00:34:11.134 --> 00:34:13.011
for one night...

398
00:34:17.224 --> 00:34:21.019
I was ready to give up everything.

399
00:34:22.688 --> 00:34:24.106
You.

400
00:34:26.733 --> 00:34:28.151
Helena.

401
00:34:30.821 --> 00:34:34.533
My whole fucking future.

402
00:34:36.785 --> 00:34:38.412
Everything.

403
00:34:45.002 --> 00:34:49.339
And yet it was weird,
because at the same time...

404
00:34:50.465 --> 00:34:53.260
you were dearer to me than ever.

405
00:34:57.764 --> 00:35:00.893
And at that moment, my love for you...

406
00:35:02.519 --> 00:35:04.771
was both...

407
00:35:07.566 --> 00:35:12.196
tender and sad.

408
00:35:23.123 --> 00:35:25.876
I barely slept that night...

409
00:35:28.378 --> 00:35:32.090
and I woke up the next morning 
in a panic.

410
00:35:34.343 --> 00:35:38.180
I didn't know whether I was afraid 
that he had left...

411
00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:43.018
or that he might still be there.

412
00:35:47.356 --> 00:35:50.567
But by dinner...

413
00:35:53.153 --> 00:35:57.074
I realized he was gone...

414
00:36:01.703 --> 00:36:05.749
and I was...

415
00:36:06.625 --> 00:36:08.710
relieved.

416
00:36:37.739 --> 00:36:39.449
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

417
00:36:46.039 --> 00:36:47.624
When did it happen?

418
00:36:54.464 --> 00:36:55.966
I have the address.

419
00:36:56.842 --> 00:36:58.093
Thank you.

420
00:37:05.809 --> 00:37:08.061
Lou Nathanson just died.

421
00:37:16.612 --> 00:37:19.615
I think I have to go over there
and show my face.

422
00:38:13.544 --> 00:38:16.213
- Hello, Rosa.
- Good evening, Dr. Harford.

423
00:38:17.631 --> 00:38:21.510
- How is Miss Nathanson?
- Not so good. She's in the bedroom.

424
00:38:21.677 --> 00:38:22.803
Thank you.

425
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:39.361
Come in.

426
00:38:45.534 --> 00:38:46.743
Marion...

427
00:38:48.579 --> 00:38:50.414
Oh, Dr. Harford...

428
00:38:51.248 --> 00:38:53.959
How good of you to come.

429
00:38:54.126 --> 00:38:56.628
I came as soon as I got the message.

430
00:38:56.753 --> 00:38:58.046
Thank you.

431
00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:02.217
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

432
00:39:02.509 --> 00:39:04.261
Your father was... 

433
00:39:05.387 --> 00:39:08.265
He was a very brave man.

434
00:39:09.099 --> 00:39:10.517
Oh, thank you.

435
00:39:11.226 --> 00:39:12.936
How are you holding up?

436
00:39:15.272 --> 00:39:16.940
I'm a bit numb.

437
00:39:17.357 --> 00:39:20.152
I don't think it's really sunk in yet.

438
00:39:21.695 --> 00:39:23.697
Would you like to sit down?

439
00:39:53.435 --> 00:39:55.687
It's so unreal.

440
00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.066
Daddy had such a good day.

441
00:40:00.859 --> 00:40:05.656
His mind was clear,
and he remembered so many things.

442
00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.786
Then he had a little dinner...

443
00:40:11.203 --> 00:40:14.498
and he said he felt like
taking a nap.

444
00:40:15.791 --> 00:40:20.629
I went into the kitchen and talked to Rosa 
for half an hour at most...

445
00:40:22.047 --> 00:40:25.092
and when I went to see how he was...

446
00:40:25.342 --> 00:40:27.678
I just thought he was asleep.

447
00:40:32.683 --> 00:40:36.687
Then I realized he wasn't breathing.

448
00:40:42.484 --> 00:40:44.069
From what you've said...

449
00:40:44.319 --> 00:40:48.323
I'm sure your father died peacefully 
in his sleep.

450
00:40:50.075 --> 00:40:52.327
Oh, God, I hope so.

451
00:40:54.538 --> 00:40:59.501
I think I've been more afraid 
of the way it was going to happen...

452
00:41:00.169 --> 00:41:02.254
than his death itself.

453
00:41:04.006 --> 00:41:06.800
Have you had a chance to phone
any of your relatives?

454
00:41:09.011 --> 00:41:13.390
I tried to call my stepmother in London,
but she was out.

455
00:41:14.057 --> 00:41:16.852
My boyfriend, Carl, is making some calls...

456
00:41:17.102 --> 00:41:19.938
and he'll be coming over soon.

457
00:41:24.443 --> 00:41:27.529
I think you've met Carl here a few times.

458
00:41:28.906 --> 00:41:31.992
Yes, I remember him.
He's a teacher, isn't he?

459
00:41:32.159 --> 00:41:34.244
A math professor.

460
00:41:37.206 --> 00:41:40.876
We're going to get married in May.

461
00:41:42.794 --> 00:41:46.840
Well, that's wonderful news.
Congratulations.

462
00:41:50.677 --> 00:41:52.054
Thank you.

463
00:41:54.389 --> 00:41:58.352
Carl has a new teaching appointment
at the University of Michigan.

464
00:41:58.519 --> 00:42:00.646
We'll be moving out there soon.

465
00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:05.484
Michigan's a beautiful state.
I think you'll like it a lot.

466
00:42:12.157 --> 00:42:15.077
It really could be 
a wonderful change for you, Marion.

467
00:42:34.721 --> 00:42:36.932
Oh, my God, no... 

468
00:42:56.869 --> 00:42:58.620
I love you.

469
00:43:01.373 --> 00:43:02.457
I love you.

470
00:43:02.791 --> 00:43:05.419
I love you, I love you, I love you.

471
00:43:05.711 --> 00:43:08.630
I don't want to go away with Carl.

472
00:43:08.922 --> 00:43:11.008
Marion, I don't think you realize--

473
00:43:11.175 --> 00:43:12.509
I do.

474
00:43:12.759 --> 00:43:17.764
Even if I'm never to see you again,
I want at least to live near you.

475
00:43:18.557 --> 00:43:21.518
Marion, listen to me. Listen to me.

476
00:43:22.811 --> 00:43:27.608
You're very upset, and I don't think
you realize what you're saying.

477
00:43:29.401 --> 00:43:30.819
I love you.

478
00:43:32.196 --> 00:43:35.115
We barely know each other.

479
00:43:36.074 --> 00:43:39.786
We haven't had a single conversation
about anything except your father.

480
00:43:40.078 --> 00:43:41.705
I love you.

481
00:43:47.878 --> 00:43:49.755
That's probably Carl.

482
00:43:50.881 --> 00:43:53.091
Please don't despise me.

483
00:43:58.889 --> 00:44:00.974
- Hello, Rosa.
- Hello, Mr. Thomas.

484
00:44:02.643 --> 00:44:05.979
- Is she in the bedroom?
- Yes, she is.

485
00:44:06.188 --> 00:44:07.272
Thank you.

486
00:44:18.742 --> 00:44:19.785
Come in.

487
00:44:24.957 --> 00:44:26.291
Darling.

488
00:44:30.254 --> 00:44:32.339
I'm so very sorry.

489
00:44:33.215 --> 00:44:34.800
Are you all right?

490
00:44:35.384 --> 00:44:36.885
I'm okay.

491
00:44:38.929 --> 00:44:42.307
- Dr. Harford, good evening.
- Good evening, Carl.

492
00:44:42.516 --> 00:44:45.435
Thank you very much
for coming over here tonight.

493
00:44:45.561 --> 00:44:48.564
- It's the least I could do.
- It means a lot to us.

494
00:44:48.897 --> 00:44:50.023
Thank you.

495
00:44:54.903 --> 00:44:57.739
I was actually on my way out.

496
00:45:00.534 --> 00:45:01.743
Marion...

497
00:45:03.203 --> 00:45:05.622
your father was very proud of you...

498
00:45:05.914 --> 00:45:10.919
and I know you gave him great comfort 
these last months.

499
00:45:12.337 --> 00:45:13.630
Thank you.

500
00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:22.431
I'll show you out.

501
00:45:25.058 --> 00:45:26.310
Good night.

502
00:46:14.233 --> 00:46:16.652
Listen to this.
She had a red rose in her mouth.

503
00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:19.363
She was doing a Mexican lap dance
right in my face.

504
00:46:19.613 --> 00:46:22.950
I'm serious!
I got scars on the back of my neck.

505
00:46:23.158 --> 00:46:25.035
What team's this switch hitter playing for?

506
00:46:25.244 --> 00:46:27.663
- Looks like the pink team.
- Look at this faggot!

507
00:46:27.871 --> 00:46:29.623
Hey, watch it, you faggot!

508
00:46:29.832 --> 00:46:32.167
Merry Christmas, Mary!

509
00:46:32.376 --> 00:46:34.962
- Your butt-brothers are back there!
- Prime cut of meat!

510
00:46:35.212 --> 00:46:38.674
You want to take a ride in this fudge-tunnel, 
you stupid faggot?

511
00:46:39.716 --> 00:46:42.678
You should have tits,
you're standing so close!

512
00:46:42.886 --> 00:46:46.974
- I got dumps that are bigger than you!
- Come on, macho man!

513
00:46:47.182 --> 00:46:50.435
- You want a piece of this, baby?
- Exit only, honey.

514
00:46:50.769 --> 00:46:54.231
Go back to San Francisco
where you belong, man!

515
00:47:15.878 --> 00:47:19.631
Excuse me.
Do you know what time it is?

516
00:47:20.591 --> 00:47:22.259
Ten past 12.

517
00:47:24.553 --> 00:47:26.471
Going anywhere special?

518
00:47:26.889 --> 00:47:29.892
No, I'm just taking a walk.

519
00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:37.065
How'd you like to have a little fun?

520
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:39.985
I'm sorry?

521
00:47:41.403 --> 00:47:43.155
Have a little fun?

522
00:47:44.948 --> 00:47:46.909
I just live right down there.

523
00:47:47.618 --> 00:47:50.287
Would you like to come inside with me?

524
00:47:51.413 --> 00:47:53.624
Come inside with you?

525
00:47:56.251 --> 00:47:59.880
It's a lot nicer in there
than it is out here.

526
00:48:07.262 --> 00:48:08.847
You live in there?

527
00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:13.310
By yourself?

528
00:48:13.602 --> 00:48:16.271
No. I have a roommate,
but she's not home.

529
00:48:17.856 --> 00:48:19.233
Hey, it's okay.

530
00:48:20.025 --> 00:48:22.069
Listen, no one will bother us.

531
00:48:23.111 --> 00:48:24.613
It's okay. Come on.

532
00:48:25.364 --> 00:48:26.448
Come on.

533
00:48:52.766 --> 00:48:53.976
This is it.

534
00:48:58.147 --> 00:48:59.648
That's a nice tree.

535
00:49:05.946 --> 00:49:09.700
Sorry about the mess.
Maid's day off.

536
00:49:24.548 --> 00:49:25.841
It's...

537
00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:28.844
cozy. It's a...

538
00:49:29.887 --> 00:49:31.180
cozy place.

539
00:49:32.347 --> 00:49:33.724
It's okay.

540
00:49:49.531 --> 00:49:53.952
Do you suppose we should talk 
about money?

541
00:49:54.703 --> 00:49:56.205
Yeah, I guess so.

542
00:49:57.873 --> 00:49:59.958
That depends on what you want to do.

543
00:50:04.546 --> 00:50:06.006
What do you want to do?

544
00:50:10.385 --> 00:50:12.095
What do you recommend?

545
00:50:16.892 --> 00:50:18.602
What do I recommend?

546
00:50:33.242 --> 00:50:36.119
I'd rather not put it into words.

547
00:50:38.914 --> 00:50:41.083
How about you just leave it up to me?

548
00:50:41.583 --> 00:50:43.377
I'm in your hands.

549
00:50:46.255 --> 00:50:48.841
And how does 150 sound?

550
00:50:49.883 --> 00:50:52.344
Sounds wonderful.

551
00:50:56.348 --> 00:51:00.310
Don't worry. 
I don't keep track of the time.

552
00:51:08.152 --> 00:51:09.069
<i>Thank you.</i>

553
00:51:09.278 --> 00:51:10.279
<i>Prego, Prego.</i>

554
00:51:10.529 --> 00:51:12.781
<i>- Grazie.
- You're welcome.</i>

555
00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:16.243
<i>If I was Italian, 
he'd have answered me in Italian.</i>

556
00:52:00.537 --> 00:52:01.872
Shall we?

557
00:52:20.265 --> 00:52:21.600
Excuse me.

558
00:52:35.906 --> 00:52:37.699
Is everything all right?

559
00:52:41.537 --> 00:52:44.873
I was just wondering 
if you were going to be much longer?

560
00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:51.380
Listen, it's a little difficult
to talk right now.

561
00:52:52.214 --> 00:52:54.091
It could be awhile.

562
00:52:55.551 --> 00:52:57.719
Any idea how long?

563
00:52:58.554 --> 00:53:01.014
No, I don't really know.

564
00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:04.142
We're still waiting
for some relatives to arrive.

565
00:53:06.228 --> 00:53:10.440
Well, I'm gonna go to bed now.

566
00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:32.504
Was that Mrs. Dr. Bill?

567
00:53:52.774 --> 00:53:54.276
Do you have to go?

568
00:53:55.569 --> 00:53:57.696
Do I have to go?

569
00:54:02.367 --> 00:54:04.036
I think I do.

570
00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:08.248
Are you sure?

571
00:54:14.421 --> 00:54:16.632
Yes, I'm afraid so.

572
00:54:19.885 --> 00:54:22.804
But listen, I want to pay you anyway.

573
00:54:23.305 --> 00:54:27.684
How much did you say it was?
Hundred and fifty?

574
00:54:31.563 --> 00:54:35.150
But you know what? 
You don't have to bother about that.

575
00:54:35.359 --> 00:54:36.819
No, it's all right.

576
00:54:37.736 --> 00:54:40.864
- No, really. You don't have to.
- No, I want to.

577
00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:44.409
Really?

578
00:54:46.995 --> 00:54:48.956
Well, thank you very much.

579
00:55:33.709 --> 00:55:34.877
Thank you.

580
00:55:49.391 --> 00:55:52.686
Would you like a table,
or would you like to sit at the bar?

581
00:55:52.895 --> 00:55:55.731
- I'd like a table.
- Please follow me.

582
00:56:03.864 --> 00:56:06.074
- Can I take your coat?
- Thank you.

583
00:56:07.242 --> 00:56:09.244
Could I get you anything to drink?

584
00:56:10.412 --> 00:56:12.748
- I'd like a beer.
- Certainly.

585
00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:25.761
One, two, one-two-three-four.

586
00:56:27.012 --> 00:56:29.223
That's it for tonight,
ladies and gentlemen.

587
00:56:29.431 --> 00:56:34.144
On the bass, Mr. Larry McVey.
On the drums, Kip Fleming.

588
00:56:34.353 --> 00:56:38.440
And on the guitar, the one, 
the only, Mr. Bobby Berman.

589
00:56:38.649 --> 00:56:42.861
We'll be here for the next two weeks,
so please do stop by.

590
00:56:43.111 --> 00:56:45.656
I'm Nick Nightingale. 
Good night.

591
00:56:56.083 --> 00:56:58.627
- Nick, that was great.
- Thanks.

592
00:56:59.002 --> 00:57:02.339
- Nightingale.
- Hey, Bill, you made it.

593
00:57:02.548 --> 00:57:06.093
I'm sorry, I got here just 
as you were finishing your last set.

594
00:57:06.301 --> 00:57:09.346
That's all right.
The band sucked tonight anyway.

595
00:57:09.972 --> 00:57:13.141
- What are you drinking?
- A vodka and tonic, please.

596
00:57:14.726 --> 00:57:15.769
Thank you.

597
00:57:17.521 --> 00:57:19.815
So what brings you out at this hour?

598
00:57:20.023 --> 00:57:23.193
- I have a patient in the neighborhood.
- You live in the Village?

599
00:57:23.402 --> 00:57:26.321
No, we have an apartment
on Central Park West.

600
00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:27.948
You're married?

601
00:57:28.574 --> 00:57:29.950
Nine years.

602
00:57:30.367 --> 00:57:33.328
- Any kids?
- Yes, we have a 7-year-old daughter.

603
00:57:33.537 --> 00:57:34.580
How about you?

604
00:57:34.788 --> 00:57:37.416
I've got a wife 
and four boys in Seattle.

605
00:57:37.624 --> 00:57:39.001
You're a long way from home.

606
00:57:39.459 --> 00:57:42.129
Well, you gotta go where the work is.

607
00:57:42.963 --> 00:57:43.964
Thank you.

608
00:57:50.053 --> 00:57:52.472
- Is this your band?
- No, it's a pick-up band.

609
00:57:52.681 --> 00:57:56.727
- Who do you normally play with?
- Anybody, anywhere.

610
00:57:56.977 --> 00:57:59.438
I got another gig later tonight.

611
00:57:59.646 --> 00:58:01.565
You're playing somewhere else tonight?

612
00:58:01.773 --> 00:58:03.484
They only get started around 2.

613
00:58:04.276 --> 00:58:05.486
In the Village?

614
00:58:07.696 --> 00:58:11.116
Believe it or not, 
I don't actually know the address yet.

615
00:58:11.533 --> 00:58:12.576
You don't?

616
00:58:13.243 --> 00:58:17.998
No. it may sound ridiculous, 
but it's in a different place every time...

617
00:58:18.207 --> 00:58:21.001
and I only get it an hour or so before.

618
00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:23.879
- A different place every time?
- So far.

619
00:58:25.005 --> 00:58:26.215
What's the big mystery?

620
00:58:27.007 --> 00:58:30.260
Hey, man, I just play the piano.

621
00:58:33.972 --> 00:58:37.226
Nick, I'm sorry.
is there something I'm missing here?

622
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:43.106
I play blindfolded.

623
00:58:44.233 --> 00:58:45.400
What?

624
00:58:47.236 --> 00:58:49.822
I play blindfolded.

625
00:58:53.867 --> 00:58:55.410
You're putting me on.

626
00:58:55.619 --> 00:58:58.080
No, it's the truth.

627
00:58:59.081 --> 00:59:03.710
And the last time,
the blindfold wasn't on so well.

628
00:59:06.088 --> 00:59:07.798
Oh, man.

629
00:59:08.966 --> 00:59:13.303
Bill, I have seen one or two things
in my life...

630
00:59:13.679 --> 00:59:15.347
but never...

631
00:59:15.722 --> 00:59:18.141
never anything like this...

632
00:59:18.892 --> 00:59:21.937
and never such women.

633
00:59:32.197 --> 00:59:33.448
Excuse me.

634
00:59:37.327 --> 00:59:40.372
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, this is Nick.

635
00:59:46.211 --> 00:59:48.046
I know where that is.

636
00:59:55.637 --> 00:59:56.597
Right.

637
01:00:00.225 --> 01:00:02.144
Well, I'm on my way right now.

638
01:00:02.895 --> 01:00:05.439
Okay, sir. Thank you.

639
01:00:07.858 --> 01:00:09.151
What is this?

640
01:00:10.736 --> 01:00:13.363
It's the name of a Beethoven opera,
isn't it?

641
01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:19.828
It's the password.

642
01:00:20.579 --> 01:00:22.080
The password?

643
01:00:23.332 --> 01:00:27.002
Yeah. Look, I'm really sorry
to do this to you, Bill.

644
01:00:28.003 --> 01:00:31.882
I gotta get going. I gotta go.

645
01:00:36.929 --> 01:00:40.891
You know there is no way on earth...

646
01:00:41.350 --> 01:00:44.853
that you are going to leave here
without taking me with you.

647
01:00:45.521 --> 01:00:49.191
- Come on, buddy, give me a break.
- Nick, I'll tell you what.

648
01:00:49.399 --> 01:00:52.653
I've already got the password.

649
01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:56.740
Just give me the address.
I'll go there by myself...

650
01:00:56.949 --> 01:01:00.536
and there won't be any connection
between us whatsoever.

651
01:01:03.247 --> 01:01:07.417
Listen, let's just say for one second...

652
01:01:08.377 --> 01:01:10.587
that I was prepared to do that.

653
01:01:10.921 --> 01:01:14.258
You couldn't get in anyway
in those clothes.

654
01:01:15.425 --> 01:01:16.760
Why not?

655
01:01:17.219 --> 01:01:21.515
Because everyone is always
costumed and masked.

656
01:01:22.349 --> 01:01:26.019
Where the hell are you gonna get a costume 
at this hour?

657
01:01:45.956 --> 01:01:48.125
Thanks. Keep the change.

658
01:02:01.263 --> 01:02:03.557
<i>Yes? Who is it?</i>

659
01:02:03.765 --> 01:02:05.517
Peter, this is Bill Harford.

660
01:02:05.726 --> 01:02:10.147
I apologize for disturbing you
at this hour, but I need your help.

661
01:02:11.273 --> 01:02:13.192
<i>Who is it that you want?</i>

662
01:02:14.776 --> 01:02:17.738
I'm very sorry.
I'm looking for Peter Grenning...

663
01:02:17.988 --> 01:02:20.449
the owner of Rainbow Fashions.

664
01:02:22.576 --> 01:02:24.077
<i>What's your name?</i>

665
01:02:24.286 --> 01:02:26.622
My name is Bill Harford.

666
01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:29.041
I'm Mr. Grenning's doctor.

667
01:02:30.042 --> 01:02:31.960
<i>You are Grenning's doctor?</i>

668
01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:36.298
<i>Okay.</i>

669
01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.300
<i>Just a moment.</i>

670
01:02:53.482 --> 01:02:55.567
You are looking for Peter Grenning?

671
01:02:56.068 --> 01:02:57.361
Yes, I am.

672
01:02:57.861 --> 01:03:01.740
He moved to Chicago over a year ago.

673
01:03:02.533 --> 01:03:04.743
He moved to Chicago?

674
01:03:07.412 --> 01:03:09.456
I wasn't aware of that.

675
01:03:11.416 --> 01:03:15.003
Then are you the present owner
of Rainbow Fashions?

676
01:03:15.212 --> 01:03:16.839
Yes, I am.

677
01:03:17.297 --> 01:03:18.215
Well, first of all...

678
01:03:18.465 --> 01:03:23.345
please let me apologize once again
for disturbing you at this hour, Mr....

679
01:03:23.554 --> 01:03:24.763
Milich.

680
01:03:24.972 --> 01:03:29.143
Mr. Milich. Just to let you know
that I really am Dr. Harford...

681
01:03:29.351 --> 01:03:32.354
this is my New York State
Medical Board card.

682
01:03:33.272 --> 01:03:36.233
Okay, so you are Dr. Harford.

683
01:03:36.441 --> 01:03:39.862
If I see Peter, 
I tell him you were looking for him.

684
01:03:40.070 --> 01:03:42.197
Oh, no, wait. Please, please...

685
01:03:42.823 --> 01:03:46.326
Listen, the reason 
that I came here tonight was...

686
01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:53.292
Basically, the reason is
that I need a costume.

687
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:57.546
And I'd be happy to pay you $100 
over the rental price...

688
01:03:57.754 --> 01:03:59.423
for the inconvenience.

689
01:04:01.258 --> 01:04:02.551
A hundred dollars?

690
01:04:06.054 --> 01:04:07.723
I don't think so.

691
01:04:11.185 --> 01:04:13.061
How about $200?

692
01:04:13.687 --> 01:04:16.231
Two hundred dollars
over the rental price?

693
01:04:28.076 --> 01:04:29.328
Come in.

694
01:04:33.790 --> 01:04:36.418
Can't be too careful these days.

695
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:40.797
Please.

696
01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:46.470
Is it any special costume
you are looking for?

697
01:04:49.515 --> 01:04:54.478
I need a tux, 
a cloak with a hood and a mask.

698
01:04:54.937 --> 01:04:57.981
A cloak with a hood and a mask?

699
01:05:01.819 --> 01:05:04.404
I think we'll find something for you.

700
01:05:05.155 --> 01:05:06.824
Follow me, please.

701
01:05:07.366 --> 01:05:08.367
Good.

702
01:05:17.334 --> 01:05:19.503
Looks like alive, huh?

703
01:05:21.255 --> 01:05:23.257
- It's wonderful.
- Come.

704
01:05:24.299 --> 01:05:26.593
So what color cloak?

705
01:05:28.053 --> 01:05:29.763
Black, brown, red?

706
01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:32.224
Black.

707
01:05:32.432 --> 01:05:35.978
The good doctor wouldn't like 
something more colorful?

708
01:05:36.186 --> 01:05:38.814
- I don't think so.
- Clowns, officers, pirates?

709
01:05:39.064 --> 01:05:41.692
No, just the tux, the black cloak--

710
01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:44.153
With a hood and a mask.

711
01:05:46.613 --> 01:05:48.115
May I take your coat?

712
01:05:49.992 --> 01:05:53.287
- You are medicine doctor, yes?
- Yes, I am.

713
01:05:54.246 --> 01:05:58.083
- I have some problem with my hair.
- Your hair?

714
01:05:58.292 --> 01:06:00.335
It's starting to fall down too fast.

715
01:06:00.544 --> 01:06:03.463
I lost, in two weeks, a lot of hair.
Mostly here.

716
01:06:03.672 --> 01:06:05.674
Look at this. Here.

717
01:06:07.009 --> 01:06:08.135
You see?

718
01:06:08.844 --> 01:06:10.012
And?

719
01:06:10.888 --> 01:06:13.140
I'm afraid this really isn't my field.

720
01:06:13.348 --> 01:06:15.350
What? You can't help me?

721
01:06:15.559 --> 01:06:19.146
No. You should see a trichologist,
it's a hair specialist.

722
01:06:19.354 --> 01:06:22.983
Mr. Milich, I've obviously left things 
a bit late tonight.

723
01:06:23.192 --> 01:06:24.902
So if you don't mind--

724
01:06:25.110 --> 01:06:27.196
I'm in hurry too, to get back to bed.

725
01:06:27.404 --> 01:06:28.697
I understand.

726
01:06:29.698 --> 01:06:31.283
So black cloak?

727
01:06:36.205 --> 01:06:37.623
Did you hear something?

728
01:06:40.918 --> 01:06:42.503
What is this?

729
01:06:52.221 --> 01:06:54.014
What is it?

730
01:06:59.102 --> 01:07:01.063
What is this?

731
01:07:14.785 --> 01:07:17.454
What on earth is going on here?!

732
01:07:17.663 --> 01:07:19.790
Milich, I can explain everything.

733
01:07:19.998 --> 01:07:22.292
You! What are you doing here?

734
01:07:22.501 --> 01:07:24.294
I promise I'll kill you!

735
01:07:24.545 --> 01:07:28.423
And you!
Have you no sense of decency?

736
01:07:28.632 --> 01:07:32.427
Gentlemen, have you no sense of decency?!

737
01:07:32.636 --> 01:07:36.265
Milich, are you crazy? 
We were invited here by the young lady.

738
01:07:36.473 --> 01:07:40.853
Young lady? This is my daughter!
Couldn't you see she's a child?

739
01:07:41.103 --> 01:07:43.856
- You will have to explain to police!
- To the police?!

740
01:07:44.064 --> 01:07:46.900
You little whore!
I kill you for this.

741
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:50.696
I promise, I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

742
01:07:50.904 --> 01:07:53.073
Hold on to that girl for me, please!

743
01:07:53.282 --> 01:07:57.202
Milich, this is preposterous.
The young lady invited us here.

744
01:07:57.452 --> 01:07:59.538
Couldn't you see she is deranged?!

745
01:07:59.705 --> 01:08:01.331
Doctor, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

746
01:08:01.582 --> 01:08:04.376
Gentlemen, this is now a police matter.

747
01:08:04.626 --> 01:08:07.254
You will please stay here until I return.

748
01:08:07.421 --> 01:08:09.047
Let us out of here!

749
01:08:09.214 --> 01:08:11.175
That's out of the question.

750
01:08:11.466 --> 01:08:14.970
Doctor, sorry.
What color did you say?

751
01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:16.763
- Black?
- Black.

752
01:08:17.473 --> 01:08:21.101
Gentlemen, please have the goodness
to be quiet for the moment!

753
01:08:21.268 --> 01:08:23.520
Couldn't you see
I try to serve my customer?

754
01:08:23.812 --> 01:08:24.646
Sorry.

755
01:08:25.272 --> 01:08:28.817
And you, little whore, go to bed at once, 
you depraved creature.

756
01:08:29.067 --> 01:08:31.403
I'll deal with you
after I serve this gentleman.

757
01:08:32.196 --> 01:08:34.907
You should have a cloak lined with ermine.

758
01:10:21.805 --> 01:10:23.974
Okay, that's $74.50.

759
01:10:24.725 --> 01:10:28.562
Seventy-four fifty. All right.

760
01:10:29.730 --> 01:10:31.273
There's 80.

761
01:10:31.773 --> 01:10:34.526
I promised you 50 bucks
over the meter, right?

762
01:10:36.904 --> 01:10:40.282
I'll make that a hundred,
if you wait for me.

763
01:10:40.532 --> 01:10:42.075
Just let the meter run.

764
01:10:42.326 --> 01:10:45.704
I'll give you the other half
plus the meter when I get back.

765
01:10:45.829 --> 01:10:48.499
- Okay?
- How long you gonna be?

766
01:10:48.749 --> 01:10:52.127
I don't know, maybe an hour or more.
But maybe only 10 minutes.

767
01:10:53.337 --> 01:10:55.255
I'll leave my stuff here in the back.

768
01:11:13.190 --> 01:11:14.525
Good evening, sir.

769
01:11:15.484 --> 01:11:16.777
Good evening.

770
01:11:17.444 --> 01:11:18.821
Can we be of any help?

771
01:11:20.489 --> 01:11:22.407
I suppose you'd like the password.

772
01:11:22.658 --> 01:11:24.201
If you'd like, sir.

773
01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:25.452
Fidelio.

774
01:11:25.702 --> 01:11:28.747
Thank you, sir.
We'll run you up to the house.

775
01:12:08.871 --> 01:12:10.539
Good evening, sir.

776
01:12:10.789 --> 01:12:12.124
Good evening.

777
01:12:12.416 --> 01:12:14.001
Password, sir?

778
01:12:14.793 --> 01:12:15.794
Fidelio.

779
01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:17.838
Thank you, sir.

780
01:18:23.245 --> 01:18:26.123
I'm not sure what you think you're doing.

781
01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:28.542
But you don't belong here.

782
01:18:29.334 --> 01:18:34.298
I'm sorry, but I think 
you've mistaken me for someone else.

783
01:18:37.676 --> 01:18:40.762
Please! Don't be foolish.

784
01:18:41.388 --> 01:18:43.182
You must go now.

785
01:18:47.978 --> 01:18:49.188
Who are you?

786
01:18:49.521 --> 01:18:51.690
It doesn't matter who I am.

787
01:18:52.316 --> 01:18:54.568
You are in great danger.

788
01:18:55.569 --> 01:18:58.322
You must get away
while there's still a chance.

789
01:19:02.618 --> 01:19:05.662
Would you be so good 
as to excuse us for a moment?

790
01:22:04.591 --> 01:22:07.136
Have you been enjoying yourself?

791
01:22:09.012 --> 01:22:12.599
Well, I've had 
a very interesting look around.

792
01:22:15.227 --> 01:22:18.814
Do you want to go somewhere
a little more private?

793
01:22:22.276 --> 01:22:23.318
Private?

794
01:22:26.029 --> 01:22:27.698
That might be a good idea.

795
01:22:27.948 --> 01:22:32.703
Here you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

796
01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:36.582
May I borrow him for just a few minutes?

797
01:22:36.874 --> 01:22:39.334
I promise to bring him right back.

798
01:22:49.428 --> 01:22:52.389
I don't think you realize 
the danger you're in now.

799
01:22:52.639 --> 01:22:54.641
You can't fool them for much longer.

800
01:22:54.892 --> 01:22:57.936
You've got to get away
before it's too late.

801
01:22:59.855 --> 01:23:01.815
Why are you telling me this?

802
01:23:02.191 --> 01:23:04.067
It doesn't matter.

803
01:23:04.443 --> 01:23:05.319
Who are you?

804
01:23:07.112 --> 01:23:11.283
You don't want to know.
But you must go. Now!

805
01:23:13.076 --> 01:23:14.661
Will you come with me?

806
01:23:14.912 --> 01:23:16.580
That's impossible.

807
01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:17.873
Why?

808
01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:22.377
Because it would cost me my life
and possibly yours.

809
01:23:23.670 --> 01:23:25.422
Let me see your face.

810
01:23:27.049 --> 01:23:28.175
Go!

811
01:23:30.427 --> 01:23:32.012
Excuse me, sir.

812
01:23:35.224 --> 01:23:38.602
Are you the gentleman
with the taxi waiting for him?

813
01:23:40.062 --> 01:23:41.271
Yes.

814
01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:45.651
Your driver's at the front door 
and would urgently like a word with you.

815
01:24:47.963 --> 01:24:51.425
Please, come forward.

816
01:25:23.749 --> 01:25:27.002
May I have the password, please?

817
01:25:29.671 --> 01:25:31.465
Fidelio.

818
01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:35.219
That's right, sir.
That is the password...

819
01:25:35.302 --> 01:25:37.137
for admittance.

820
01:25:37.930 --> 01:25:42.851
But may I ask, 
what is the password for the house?

821
01:25:48.398 --> 01:25:51.401
The password for the house?

822
01:26:02.704 --> 01:26:04.289
I'm sorry...

823
01:26:10.879 --> 01:26:12.506
I seem to have...

824
01:26:14.091 --> 01:26:15.676
forgotten it.

825
01:26:17.469 --> 01:26:19.888
That's unfortunate.

826
01:26:20.722 --> 01:26:25.686
Because here, it doesn't matter
whether you have forgotten it...

827
01:26:26.103 --> 01:26:28.772
or if you never knew it.

828
01:26:29.982 --> 01:26:34.027
You will kindly remove your mask.

829
01:26:54.715 --> 01:26:55.883
Now...

830
01:26:56.592 --> 01:26:58.135
get undressed.

831
01:27:04.558 --> 01:27:07.895
Get undressed?

832
01:27:09.062 --> 01:27:12.316
Remove your clothes.

833
01:27:23.827 --> 01:27:27.164
Gentlemen, please... 

834
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.794
Remove your clothes.

835
01:27:32.836 --> 01:27:36.840
Or would you like us to do it for you?

836
01:27:38.342 --> 01:27:39.468
Stop!

837
01:27:45.307 --> 01:27:48.143
Let him go.

838
01:27:50.062 --> 01:27:51.855
Take me!

839
01:27:53.398 --> 01:27:56.902
I am ready to redeem him.

840
01:28:03.075 --> 01:28:06.745
You are ready to redeem him?

841
01:28:08.831 --> 01:28:10.332
Yes.

842
01:28:13.210 --> 01:28:17.214
Are you sure you understand
what you're taking upon yourself...

843
01:28:17.673 --> 01:28:19.758
in doing this?

844
01:28:29.143 --> 01:28:30.477
Very well.

845
01:28:35.649 --> 01:28:37.401
You are free.

846
01:28:39.361 --> 01:28:40.988
But I warn you...

847
01:28:41.655 --> 01:28:44.241
if you make any further inquiries...

848
01:28:44.366 --> 01:28:48.412
or if you say a single word to anyone...

849
01:28:48.537 --> 01:28:51.331
about what you have seen...

850
01:28:51.456 --> 01:28:55.961
there will be 
the most dire consequences for you...

851
01:28:56.295 --> 01:28:58.213
and your family.

852
01:28:59.965 --> 01:29:02.050
Do you understand?

853
01:29:41.924 --> 01:29:44.468
What is going to happen to that woman?

854
01:29:45.302 --> 01:29:48.305
No one can change her fate now.

855
01:29:49.139 --> 01:29:51.934
When a promise has been made here...

856
01:29:52.810 --> 01:29:55.312
there is no turning back.

857
01:29:56.563 --> 01:29:57.815
Go!

858
01:32:07.945 --> 01:32:09.404
It's okay.

859
01:32:10.614 --> 01:32:12.074
I'm sorry.

860
01:32:12.616 --> 01:32:17.162
I'm sorry I woke you up, but I thought
you were having a nightmare.

861
01:32:17.746 --> 01:32:19.206
Oh, God.

862
01:32:20.290 --> 01:32:23.210
I just had such a horrible dream.

863
01:32:25.003 --> 01:32:26.588
What time is it?

864
01:32:27.047 --> 01:32:28.924
It's a little after 4.

865
01:32:31.635 --> 01:32:33.637
Did you just get home?

866
01:32:36.348 --> 01:32:40.102
It took longer than I thought.

867
01:32:40.519 --> 01:32:42.688
You must be exhausted.

868
01:32:43.313 --> 01:32:46.692
Come on, lie down.

869
01:32:55.367 --> 01:32:57.202
What were you dreaming?

870
01:33:03.375 --> 01:33:06.253
Just these weird things.

871
01:33:06.587 --> 01:33:08.046
What was it?

872
01:33:11.717 --> 01:33:14.386
It was so weird.

873
01:33:17.014 --> 01:33:18.265
Tell me.

874
01:33:39.369 --> 01:33:42.539
We were in a deserted city...

875
01:33:47.586 --> 01:33:50.047
and our clothes were gone.

876
01:33:51.965 --> 01:33:53.884
We were naked...

877
01:33:59.389 --> 01:34:02.100
and I was terrified...

878
01:34:07.105 --> 01:34:09.525
and I felt ashamed.

879
01:34:10.609 --> 01:34:12.236
Oh, God...

880
01:34:16.615 --> 01:34:20.661
And I was angry because I thought 
it was your fault.

881
01:34:23.247 --> 01:34:27.584
You rushed away to go find clothes for us.

882
01:34:32.005 --> 01:34:35.968
As soon as you were gone,
it was completely different.

883
01:34:40.222 --> 01:34:42.224
I felt wonderful.

884
01:34:46.728 --> 01:34:51.400
Then I was lying in a beautiful garden...

885
01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:55.112
stretched out naked in the sunlight...

886
01:35:00.033 --> 01:35:02.911
and a man walked out of the woods.

887
01:35:07.166 --> 01:35:11.462
He was the man from the hotel,
the one I told you about.

888
01:35:14.173 --> 01:35:16.008
The naval officer.

889
01:35:20.888 --> 01:35:23.098
He stared at me...

890
01:35:28.061 --> 01:35:30.230
and then he just laughed.

891
01:35:33.150 --> 01:35:35.319
He just laughed at me.

892
01:35:51.585 --> 01:35:53.420
But that's not the end...

893
01:35:54.505 --> 01:35:55.714
is it?

894
01:36:01.512 --> 01:36:03.847
Why don't you tell me the rest of it?

895
01:36:09.728 --> 01:36:11.688
It's too awful.

896
01:36:13.524 --> 01:36:15.400
It's only a dream.

897
01:36:40.884 --> 01:36:42.970
He was kissing me...

898
01:36:49.393 --> 01:36:52.229
and then we were making love.

899
01:36:57.234 --> 01:37:00.737
Then there were all these
other people around us...

900
01:37:00.946 --> 01:37:03.782
hundreds of them, everywhere.

901
01:37:03.991 --> 01:37:06.535
Everyone was fucking.

902
01:37:12.374 --> 01:37:13.917
And then I... 

903
01:37:17.004 --> 01:37:19.506
I was fucking other men.

904
01:37:20.215 --> 01:37:21.925
So many...

905
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:26.346
I don't know how many I was with.

906
01:37:29.475 --> 01:37:34.354
And I knew you could see me
in the arms of all these men...

907
01:37:37.232 --> 01:37:40.110
just fucking all these men.

908
01:37:44.573 --> 01:37:47.284
I wanted to make fun of you...

909
01:37:49.036 --> 01:37:51.455
to laugh in your face.

910
01:37:54.750 --> 01:37:59.713
And so I laughed as loud as I could.

911
01:38:13.811 --> 01:38:16.980
That must have been when you woke me up.

912
01:39:01.233 --> 01:39:02.693
Shit!

913
01:39:39.771 --> 01:39:41.857
I'll just have a cup of coffee, please.

914
01:39:50.491 --> 01:39:51.742
Anything else?

915
01:39:53.035 --> 01:39:54.786
No, thank you.

916
01:40:01.585 --> 01:40:03.003
Excuse me.

917
01:40:04.004 --> 01:40:07.174
Do you know when they get in
next door at the Sonata CafÃ©?

918
01:40:07.382 --> 01:40:10.803
I think there's usually someone
in the office around 2 or 3.

919
01:40:15.349 --> 01:40:19.853
I don't suppose, by any chance,
you know Nick Nightingale?

920
01:40:20.062 --> 01:40:23.023
He's playing piano over there right now.

921
01:40:23.315 --> 01:40:24.817
Nick Nightingale?

922
01:40:25.234 --> 01:40:27.820
Sure, he comes in here.

923
01:40:30.614 --> 01:40:33.408
Look, maybe you can help me...

924
01:40:33.617 --> 01:40:37.246
because it's important that
I get in touch with him.

925
01:40:38.455 --> 01:40:40.207
Do you know where he's staying?

926
01:40:43.877 --> 01:40:46.964
I don't know if he'd want me
to give out his address.

927
01:40:47.172 --> 01:40:49.550
It's okay, I'm a doctor.

928
01:40:49.842 --> 01:40:52.302
I'm actually an old friend of his.

929
01:40:53.887 --> 01:40:55.389
Well, doctor...

930
01:40:57.891 --> 01:41:01.520
he'll be playing there tonight.
Can't it wait until then?

931
01:41:04.523 --> 01:41:06.441
To be perfectly honest...

932
01:41:08.735 --> 01:41:10.487
it's a medical matter.

933
01:41:10.904 --> 01:41:15.200
Some tests. I know he'll want to know 
about them as soon as possible.

934
01:41:42.478 --> 01:41:43.395
Excuse me.

935
01:41:45.105 --> 01:41:47.316
Hi! How can I help you?

936
01:41:47.483 --> 01:41:51.278
Can you please ring
Mr. Nightingale's room for me?

937
01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:55.449
I'm sorry, sir, Mr. Nightingale
has already checked out.

938
01:41:55.699 --> 01:41:57.201
He checked out?

939
01:42:01.288 --> 01:42:05.167
- Did he leave a forwarding address?
- No, I'm afraid not.

940
01:42:06.543 --> 01:42:08.378
When did he check out?

941
01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:11.840
About 5:00 this morning.

942
01:42:12.090 --> 01:42:13.425
5:00?

943
01:42:15.135 --> 01:42:17.054
That's an early checkout, isn't it?

944
01:42:17.221 --> 01:42:20.057
It is a little on the early side, yeah.

945
01:42:24.144 --> 01:42:27.022
Did you notice anything...?

946
01:42:27.397 --> 01:42:28.857
I don't know...

947
01:42:29.525 --> 01:42:32.569
unusual about him when he left?

948
01:42:34.571 --> 01:42:35.948
Unusual?

949
01:42:37.574 --> 01:42:39.576
Hey, you're not Five-O, are you? 

950
01:42:41.119 --> 01:42:42.454
No, I'm an old friend of his.

951
01:42:42.704 --> 01:42:43.831
Really?

952
01:42:44.289 --> 01:42:45.749
I'm a doctor.

953
01:42:49.044 --> 01:42:53.423
- Well, Bill...?
- Sure.

954
01:42:55.801 --> 01:42:58.720
It's funny you should ask 
that question, Bill...

955
01:42:58.929 --> 01:43:02.307
because there was something
a little strange...

956
01:43:02.474 --> 01:43:05.018
about the way Mr. Nightingale left.

957
01:43:05.352 --> 01:43:07.729
Really? What was that?

958
01:43:15.904 --> 01:43:20.450
He came in this morning,
about 4:30 a.m...

959
01:43:21.034 --> 01:43:22.953
with two men.

960
01:43:23.954 --> 01:43:25.622
Big guys.

961
01:43:26.206 --> 01:43:29.168
They were very well-dressed
and very well-spoken.

962
01:43:29.376 --> 01:43:33.046
But they weren't the kind of people
you'd fool around with...

963
01:43:33.255 --> 01:43:35.048
if you know what I mean.

964
01:43:37.843 --> 01:43:39.303
Anyways...

965
01:43:40.637 --> 01:43:45.392
I noticed Mr. Nightingale 
had a bruise on his cheek.

966
01:43:46.143 --> 01:43:51.064
To be perfectly honest, 
I also thought he looked a little scared.

967
01:43:52.065 --> 01:43:53.233
Scared?

968
01:43:55.986 --> 01:43:57.613
He said he wanted to check out.

969
01:43:57.821 --> 01:44:01.700
And then he went upstairs to his room
with one of the men.

970
01:44:02.034 --> 01:44:05.913
The other guy stayed down in the lobby
and settled his bill.

971
01:44:06.663 --> 01:44:10.793
When they came back, Mr. Nightingale 
tried to pass me an envelope.

972
01:44:11.043 --> 01:44:12.711
But they saw it and took it...

973
01:44:12.961 --> 01:44:15.881
and said that any mail or messages for him...

974
01:44:16.089 --> 01:44:20.677
would be collected by someone 
properly authorized to do so.

975
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:23.972
And then they just took him off in a car.

976
01:44:25.307 --> 01:44:27.643
Do you have any idea where they went?

977
01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:29.937
No, not a clue.

978
01:44:42.074 --> 01:44:44.243
I certainly appreciate your help.

979
01:44:44.451 --> 01:44:46.078
Anytime, Bill.

980
01:45:22.156 --> 01:45:24.908
Oh, the good doctor!

981
01:45:26.577 --> 01:45:31.582
- Was your outfit a success?
- Yes, it was. Thank you.

982
01:45:32.124 --> 01:45:33.417
Good, good.

983
01:45:33.625 --> 01:45:38.630
Tuxedo. Cloak. Shoes.

984
01:45:41.216 --> 01:45:44.970
I think you forgot the mask.

985
01:45:46.263 --> 01:45:47.764
It's not there?

986
01:45:48.682 --> 01:45:51.268
Maybe you left it at the party?

987
01:45:56.315 --> 01:45:57.900
I don't think so.

988
01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:03.405
I must have lost it.
Could you put it on the bill, please?

989
01:46:03.614 --> 01:46:04.615
Sure.

990
01:46:08.911 --> 01:46:10.787
Here we are.

991
01:46:12.331 --> 01:46:16.418
That was 150 for the rental,
200 you said for my trouble...

992
01:46:16.627 --> 01:46:20.088
25 for the mask. Sorry... 

993
01:46:22.841 --> 01:46:24.510
Three hundred seventy-five.

994
01:46:27.095 --> 01:46:28.430
Yes, dear?

995
01:46:28.764 --> 01:46:30.224
Come, come.

996
01:46:31.433 --> 01:46:34.436
Would you like to say hello to Dr. Harford?

997
01:46:43.737 --> 01:46:46.573
Thank you, Mr. Milich.
I'll call you soon.

998
01:46:47.491 --> 01:46:49.409
Goodbye, gentlemen.

999
01:46:49.701 --> 01:46:52.955
- Merry Christmas and happy New Year!
- And you too.

1000
01:46:53.914 --> 01:46:56.166
Well, Dr. Harford...

1001
01:46:57.417 --> 01:46:59.002
here is your receipt.

1002
01:47:00.337 --> 01:47:02.589
I'm tearing up your deposits...

1003
01:47:03.757 --> 01:47:06.093
and thanks for the business.

1004
01:47:10.681 --> 01:47:13.976
Mr. Milich, last night...

1005
01:47:16.770 --> 01:47:19.189
you were going to call the police.

1006
01:47:20.732 --> 01:47:24.820
Things change.
We have come to another arrangement.

1007
01:47:25.028 --> 01:47:29.992
And by the way, if the good doctor
should ever want anything again...

1008
01:47:30.617 --> 01:47:32.369
anything at all...

1009
01:47:33.370 --> 01:47:35.914
it needn't be a costume.

1010
01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:04.651
Come in.

1011
01:48:06.361 --> 01:48:09.114
- Tuna salad and black coffee.
- Thanks.

1012
01:48:10.157 --> 01:48:13.202
Listen, how's my afternoon looking?

1013
01:48:13.410 --> 01:48:18.373
I think it's just Mrs. Akerly at 2:30
and Mrs. Kominski at 4.

1014
01:48:18.749 --> 01:48:22.961
Well, something's come up, 
and I'm not going to be able to see them.

1015
01:48:23.212 --> 01:48:26.882
Please ask Dr. Miller if he can fit them in. 
Otherwise, just apologize...

1016
01:48:27.090 --> 01:48:29.009
- and make new appointments.
- Sure.

1017
01:48:29.468 --> 01:48:33.555
And please call the garage 
and have them get my car out in half an hour.

1018
01:48:33.764 --> 01:48:35.098
No problem.

1019
01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:27.539
Any calls for me?

1020
01:52:27.748 --> 01:52:31.710
Dr. Sanders and Mrs. Shapiro.

1021
01:52:33.003 --> 01:52:35.464
- Hey, gang.
- Hi, Daddy.

1022
01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:38.300
Look, I got all these right.

1023
01:52:38.509 --> 01:52:40.511
You got all of those right?

1024
01:52:41.053 --> 01:52:42.805
Every single one of them?

1025
01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:44.473
That's good.

1026
01:52:44.681 --> 01:52:46.266
You hungry?

1027
01:52:47.351 --> 01:52:48.685
Sort of.

1028
01:52:48.894 --> 01:52:50.687
Want to eat at 7?

1029
01:52:50.896 --> 01:52:53.232
Seven? Listen, can we make that earlier?

1030
01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:57.402
I have some appointments at the office.

1031
01:52:57.611 --> 01:52:59.655
You have to go out again tonight?

1032
01:52:59.863 --> 01:53:00.864
I'm afraid so.

1033
01:53:01.073 --> 01:53:04.576
Daddy, am I gonna get a puppy for Christmas?

1034
01:53:05.202 --> 01:53:07.663
We'll see about that, okay?

1035
01:53:10.249 --> 01:53:12.334
He could be a watchdog... 

1036
01:53:12.543 --> 01:53:14.044
We'll see.

1037
01:53:14.253 --> 01:53:17.005
Come on, baby, let's finish this off.

1038
01:53:17.256 --> 01:53:20.843
All right, we have Joe.
And Joe has $2.50.

1039
01:53:21.051 --> 01:53:25.681
And Mike has $1.75.

1040
01:53:25.889 --> 01:53:29.560
Joe has how much more money than Mike?

1041
01:53:29.768 --> 01:53:32.104
$0.75?

1042
01:53:34.022 --> 01:53:37.401
So is it gonna be 
a subtraction or an addition?

1043
01:53:41.155 --> 01:53:44.408
"How much more" means that
it would be a subtraction.

1044
01:53:44.616 --> 01:53:47.661
Yeah, because you're going to be taking. 
Right.

1045
01:53:47.953 --> 01:53:51.248
<i>And there were all these 
other people around us. </i>

1046
01:53:51.623 --> 01:53:54.084
<i>Hundreds of them, everywhere.</i>

1047
01:53:54.585 --> 01:53:56.837
<i>Everyone was fucking.</i>

1048
01:53:57.754 --> 01:54:01.258
<i>And then I...
I was fucking other men.</i>

1049
01:54:02.634 --> 01:54:04.303
<i>So many...</i>

1050
01:54:04.761 --> 01:54:07.723
<i>I don't know how many I was with.</i>

1051
01:55:45.237 --> 01:55:47.948
Keep the change. Merry Christmas.

1052
01:56:18.604 --> 01:56:19.480
What is it?

1053
01:56:19.730 --> 01:56:20.939
Domino?

1054
01:56:21.273 --> 01:56:23.150
No, she's not in.

1055
01:56:27.112 --> 01:56:29.323
Are you expecting her back soon?

1056
01:56:29.531 --> 01:56:31.033
No, I'm not.

1057
01:56:37.664 --> 01:56:41.084
I have something for her.
Can I leave this with you?

1058
01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:43.253
Just a minute.

1059
01:56:50.302 --> 01:56:52.095
Can I say who it's from?

1060
01:56:53.597 --> 01:56:55.974
Well, just tell her it's from...

1061
01:56:57.017 --> 01:56:58.018
Bill.

1062
01:56:58.602 --> 01:56:59.853
You're Bill?

1063
01:57:01.438 --> 01:57:05.442
The Bill? You're the doctor
who was here last night?

1064
01:57:06.485 --> 01:57:08.946
Well, I suppose I am.

1065
01:57:09.279 --> 01:57:11.573
Domino said how nice you were to her.

1066
01:57:12.908 --> 01:57:13.992
Did she?

1067
01:57:16.829 --> 01:57:18.831
Why don't you come in for a second?

1068
01:57:21.875 --> 01:57:22.918
Sure.

1069
01:57:43.689 --> 01:57:45.190
I'm Sally.

1070
01:57:45.941 --> 01:57:47.818
Hello, Sally.

1071
01:57:50.863 --> 01:57:55.868
So do you have any idea
when you expect Domino back?

1072
01:57:59.413 --> 01:58:01.373
I have no idea.

1073
01:58:02.291 --> 01:58:04.293
You have no idea?

1074
01:58:09.798 --> 01:58:14.761
To be perfectly honest,
she may not even be coming back.

1075
01:58:17.014 --> 01:58:19.850
She may not even be coming back?

1076
01:58:40.579 --> 01:58:41.747
I...

1077
01:58:45.167 --> 01:58:46.293
You...?

1078
01:58:46.543 --> 01:58:50.881
I think there's something
that I should tell you.

1079
01:58:51.381 --> 01:58:52.508
Really?

1080
01:58:54.259 --> 01:58:57.095
But I just don't know.
I don't know.

1081
01:58:57.304 --> 01:59:00.599
You don't know?
Well, what is it?

1082
01:59:04.645 --> 01:59:06.939
I don't know whether to tell you this.

1083
01:59:12.569 --> 01:59:15.447
Why don't you have a seat?

1084
01:59:16.156 --> 01:59:17.908
Let's sit down.

1085
01:59:34.091 --> 01:59:38.428
- I don't quite know how to say this.
- You don't quite know how?

1086
01:59:42.808 --> 01:59:46.603
Well, considering that you were 
with Domino last night...

1087
01:59:49.148 --> 01:59:53.569
I think it would be only fair 
to you to let you know...

1088
01:59:56.697 --> 01:59:59.992
that she got the results
of a blood test this morning...

1089
02:00:00.200 --> 02:00:03.454
and it was HIV-positive.

1090
02:00:14.506 --> 02:00:16.341
HIV-positive?

1091
02:00:31.773 --> 02:00:36.653
I am very, very sorry to hear that.

1092
02:00:43.869 --> 02:00:46.872
I mean, it's absolutely devastating.

1093
02:00:59.885 --> 02:01:02.554
Listen, can I offer you anything?

1094
02:01:03.096 --> 02:01:05.015
A cup of coffee maybe?

1095
02:01:13.690 --> 02:01:15.067
No, thank you.

1096
02:01:19.863 --> 02:01:21.448
I think...

1097
02:01:22.783 --> 02:01:24.701
maybe I'd better be going.

1098
02:03:13.644 --> 02:03:15.229
- Taxi!
- Off duty.

1099
02:05:05.047 --> 02:05:08.091
I'll just have a cappuccino, please.

1100
02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:10.093
I'll bring it over to you.

1101
02:05:10.302 --> 02:05:11.470
Thank you.

1102
02:06:51.528 --> 02:06:52.821
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1103
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:54.490
I'm Dr. Harford.

1104
02:06:54.740 --> 02:06:59.077
One of my patients was admitted this morning. 
Miss Amanda Curran.

1105
02:06:59.286 --> 02:07:01.330
Could you please give me her room number?

1106
02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:05.334
Certainly, doctor.
Her name again?

1107
02:07:05.751 --> 02:07:08.337
Curran. Amanda Curran.

1108
02:07:08.545 --> 02:07:10.714
C-U-R-R-A-N?

1109
02:07:15.302 --> 02:07:17.137
Miss Amanda Curran?

1110
02:07:17.930 --> 02:07:19.223
That's right.

1111
02:07:19.973 --> 02:07:23.435
I'm sorry, doctor.
Miss Curran died this afternoon.

1112
02:07:27.481 --> 02:07:29.358
She died this afternoon?

1113
02:07:29.733 --> 02:07:33.070
Yes, at 3:45 p.m.

1114
02:07:33.529 --> 02:07:34.988
I'm sorry.

1115
02:08:23.162 --> 02:08:25.789
<i>Because it could cost me my life...</i>

1116
02:08:26.748 --> 02:08:28.750
<i>and possibly yours.</i>

1117
02:10:14.648 --> 02:10:16.441
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

1118
02:10:18.610 --> 02:10:19.903
Tonight?

1119
02:10:20.612 --> 02:10:22.739
No, no, that's okay.

1120
02:10:26.827 --> 02:10:29.830
Please tell him I'll be there
in about 20 minutes.

1121
02:10:53.479 --> 02:10:54.771
Come in.

1122
02:10:56.815 --> 02:11:00.527
Bill, I appreciate you coming.
Sorry to drag you out here.

1123
02:11:00.819 --> 02:11:03.530
- Let me have your coat.
- I was out anyway. Thank you.

1124
02:11:03.739 --> 02:11:05.157
How about a drink?

1125
02:11:05.699 --> 02:11:07.576
- Are you having one?
- Sure.

1126
02:11:08.035 --> 02:11:09.453
What would you like?

1127
02:11:09.912 --> 02:11:11.205
Just a little scotch.

1128
02:11:11.413 --> 02:11:12.456
Good.

1129
02:11:14.458 --> 02:11:15.626
How do you take it? Neat?

1130
02:11:15.834 --> 02:11:16.960
Please.

1131
02:11:18.712 --> 02:11:20.881
That was a terrific party
the other night.

1132
02:11:21.089 --> 02:11:24.885
- Alice and I had a wonderful time.
- Well, good.

1133
02:11:25.844 --> 02:11:27.638
It was great seeing you both.

1134
02:11:27.846 --> 02:11:29.306
Cheers.

1135
02:11:30.015 --> 02:11:31.433
Were you playing?

1136
02:11:31.892 --> 02:11:35.187
No, I was just knocking 
a few balls around.

1137
02:11:36.438 --> 02:11:39.149
- Beautiful scotch.
- That's a 25-year-old.

1138
02:11:39.399 --> 02:11:41.860
- I'll send you over a case.
- No, please.

1139
02:11:42.069 --> 02:11:43.070
Why not?

1140
02:11:46.532 --> 02:11:48.700
You feel like playing?

1141
02:11:48.909 --> 02:11:52.246
No, thanks.
You go ahead, I'll watch.

1142
02:11:54.790 --> 02:11:56.250
I was just... 

1143
02:11:59.044 --> 02:12:00.170
Listen... 

1144
02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:11.723
The reason I asked you 
to come over is...

1145
02:12:13.642 --> 02:12:16.061
I need to talk to you about something.

1146
02:12:16.937 --> 02:12:18.188
Sure.

1147
02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:23.026
It's a little bit awkward.

1148
02:12:25.696 --> 02:12:28.574
And I have to be completely frank.

1149
02:12:30.784 --> 02:12:32.828
What kind of problem are you having?

1150
02:12:37.458 --> 02:12:39.543
It isn't a medical problem.

1151
02:12:45.257 --> 02:12:46.633
Actually...

1152
02:12:48.552 --> 02:12:50.471
it concerns you.

1153
02:13:03.525 --> 02:13:06.570
I know what happened last night.

1154
02:13:10.574 --> 02:13:14.203
And I know what's been going on since then.

1155
02:13:18.874 --> 02:13:22.211
And I think you just might...

1156
02:13:23.629 --> 02:13:27.049
have the wrong idea
about one or two things.

1157
02:13:40.354 --> 02:13:42.815
I'm sorry, Victor, I... 

1158
02:13:44.817 --> 02:13:48.028
What in the hell 
are you talking about?

1159
02:13:50.155 --> 02:13:52.825
Please, Bill, no games.

1160
02:13:54.993 --> 02:13:56.453
I was there.

1161
02:13:58.413 --> 02:13:59.957
At the house.

1162
02:14:03.544 --> 02:14:06.630
I saw everything that went on.

1163
02:14:18.517 --> 02:14:22.479
What the hell did you think
you were doing?

1164
02:14:26.150 --> 02:14:29.486
I couldn't even begin to imagine...

1165
02:14:30.654 --> 02:14:32.322
how you'd heard about it...

1166
02:14:32.531 --> 02:14:36.160
let alone got yourself
through the door.

1167
02:14:39.997 --> 02:14:44.960
Then I remembered seeing you
with that prick piano player...

1168
02:14:45.169 --> 02:14:48.422
Nick whatever the fuck his name was,
at my party.

1169
02:14:49.381 --> 02:14:52.384
And it didn't take much 
to figure out the rest.

1170
02:14:56.847 --> 02:14:58.682
It wasn't Nick's fault.

1171
02:15:00.476 --> 02:15:02.019
It was mine.

1172
02:15:02.478 --> 02:15:04.480
Of course it was Nick's fault.

1173
02:15:04.855 --> 02:15:08.358
If he hadn't mentioned it to you,
none of this would've happened.

1174
02:15:08.567 --> 02:15:11.278
I recommended that cocksucker
to those people...

1175
02:15:11.487 --> 02:15:14.448
and he's made me look 
like a complete asshole.

1176
02:15:22.122 --> 02:15:24.041
What can I say?

1177
02:15:30.380 --> 02:15:31.715
I had...

1178
02:15:33.217 --> 02:15:34.802
absolutely...

1179
02:15:35.719 --> 02:15:40.390
no idea you were involved in any way.

1180
02:15:41.809 --> 02:15:43.894
I know you didn't, Bill.

1181
02:15:45.813 --> 02:15:47.856
But I also know that you... 

1182
02:15:48.857 --> 02:15:51.443
You went to Nick's hotel this morning...

1183
02:15:51.693 --> 02:15:53.445
and talked to the desk clerk.

1184
02:15:55.030 --> 02:15:56.657
How do you know that?

1185
02:15:58.659 --> 02:16:00.702
Because I had you followed.

1186
02:16:06.625 --> 02:16:08.335
You had me followed?

1187
02:16:10.712 --> 02:16:12.923
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

1188
02:16:13.423 --> 02:16:15.342
All right? I owe you an apology.

1189
02:16:15.551 --> 02:16:18.220
This was for your own good, believe me.

1190
02:16:18.637 --> 02:16:22.599
I know what the desk clerk told you.
But what he didn't tell you is...

1191
02:16:22.891 --> 02:16:26.145
all they did was put Nick 
on a plane to Seattle.

1192
02:16:26.436 --> 02:16:30.149
By now he's probably back with his family...

1193
02:16:30.816 --> 02:16:32.693
banging Mrs. Nick.

1194
02:16:33.986 --> 02:16:37.322
The clerk said he had a bruise on his face.

1195
02:16:39.283 --> 02:16:42.619
Okay, he had a bruise on his face.

1196
02:16:43.662 --> 02:16:46.582
That's a hell of a lot less
than he deserves.

1197
02:16:47.499 --> 02:16:51.628
I don't think you realize 
what kind of trouble you were in last night.

1198
02:16:52.963 --> 02:16:55.048
Who do you think those people were?

1199
02:16:55.716 --> 02:16:57.968
Those were not just ordinary people there.

1200
02:16:58.093 --> 02:17:01.513
If I told you their names--
I'm not gonna tell you their names...

1201
02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:05.392
but if I did,
I don't think you'd sleep so well.

1202
02:17:09.104 --> 02:17:11.231
Was it the second password?

1203
02:17:12.566 --> 02:17:14.359
Is that what gave me away?

1204
02:17:16.403 --> 02:17:18.655
Yes, finally.

1205
02:17:20.741 --> 02:17:22.993
But not because you didn't know it.

1206
02:17:24.995 --> 02:17:27.998
It's because there was no second password.

1207
02:17:29.124 --> 02:17:33.629
Of course it didn't help a whole lot
that those people arrive in limos...

1208
02:17:33.879 --> 02:17:36.381
and you showed up in a taxi.

1209
02:17:36.507 --> 02:17:40.219
Or that they found the receipt 
from the rental house in your coat...

1210
02:17:40.511 --> 02:17:43.680
made out to you-know-who.

1211
02:18:01.281 --> 02:18:04.868
There was a woman there...

1212
02:18:10.707 --> 02:18:12.417
who tried to warn me.

1213
02:18:18.132 --> 02:18:19.299
I know.

1214
02:18:25.139 --> 02:18:26.849
Do you know who she was?

1215
02:18:40.904 --> 02:18:42.614
She was a hooker.

1216
02:18:52.166 --> 02:18:53.876
Sorry, but...

1217
02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:56.920
that's what she was.

1218
02:19:01.425 --> 02:19:02.634
A hooker.

1219
02:19:17.316 --> 02:19:19.860
Suppose I told you...

1220
02:19:21.570 --> 02:19:24.490
that everything 
that happened to you there...

1221
02:19:26.033 --> 02:19:30.037
the threats, the girl's warnings...

1222
02:19:30.329 --> 02:19:33.081
her last-minute intervention...

1223
02:19:33.207 --> 02:19:37.044
suppose I said that all of that...

1224
02:19:38.378 --> 02:19:41.173
was staged.

1225
02:19:43.300 --> 02:19:47.137
That it was a kind of charade.

1226
02:19:48.722 --> 02:19:50.557
That it was fake.

1227
02:19:55.229 --> 02:19:56.522
Fake?

1228
02:19:58.398 --> 02:20:00.901
Yes. Fake.

1229
02:20:12.412 --> 02:20:14.414
Why would they do that?

1230
02:20:15.207 --> 02:20:16.542
Why?

1231
02:20:17.709 --> 02:20:19.461
In plain words...

1232
02:20:20.379 --> 02:20:22.881
to scare the living shit out of you.

1233
02:20:24.091 --> 02:20:27.386
To keep you quiet about where you'd been...

1234
02:20:28.053 --> 02:20:29.638
and what you'd seen.

1235
02:20:49.783 --> 02:20:51.368
Have you seen this?

1236
02:21:08.719 --> 02:21:10.804
Yes, I have.

1237
02:21:16.268 --> 02:21:19.313
I saw her body in the morgue.

1238
02:21:28.197 --> 02:21:31.366
Was she the woman at the party?

1239
02:21:43.712 --> 02:21:45.005
She was.

1240
02:21:59.311 --> 02:22:01.980
The woman lying dead in the morgue...

1241
02:22:03.982 --> 02:22:05.818
was the woman at the party.

1242
02:22:14.576 --> 02:22:19.456
Well, Victor, 
maybe I'm missing something here.

1243
02:22:20.249 --> 02:22:23.836
You called it a fake, a charade.

1244
02:22:25.420 --> 02:22:28.715
Do you mind telling me
what kind of fucking charade...

1245
02:22:29.091 --> 02:22:32.928
ends with somebody turning up dead?

1246
02:22:38.809 --> 02:22:43.438
Okay, Bill, let's cut the bullshit.
All right?

1247
02:22:43.564 --> 02:22:46.483
You've been way out of your depth
for the last 24 hours.

1248
02:22:46.608 --> 02:22:50.195
You want to know what kind of charade?
I'll tell you exactly what kind.

1249
02:22:51.405 --> 02:22:54.950
That whole play-acted,
"take me" phony sacrifice...

1250
02:22:55.242 --> 02:22:59.872
that you've been jerking off with
had nothing to do with her real death.

1251
02:23:00.122 --> 02:23:03.709
Nothing happened after you left
that hadn't happened to her before.

1252
02:23:03.959 --> 02:23:06.879
She got her brains fucked out. Period.

1253
02:23:08.338 --> 02:23:12.843
When they took her home,
she was just fine...

1254
02:23:13.469 --> 02:23:15.095
and the rest is in the paper.

1255
02:23:15.220 --> 02:23:18.932
She was a junkie. She OD'd.
There was nothing suspicious.

1256
02:23:19.224 --> 02:23:23.437
Her door was locked from the inside.
The police are happy. End of story.

1257
02:23:24.897 --> 02:23:29.818
Come on. it was always gonna be
just a matter of time with her.

1258
02:23:30.194 --> 02:23:31.779
Remember, you told her so yourself.

1259
02:23:31.904 --> 02:23:35.908
You remember, the one with the great tits 
who OD'd in my bathroom?

1260
02:23:52.841 --> 02:23:56.970
Listen, Bill, nobody killed anybody.

1261
02:23:57.346 --> 02:24:00.015
Someone died. It happens all the time.

1262
02:24:01.475 --> 02:24:03.852
But life goes on.

1263
02:24:04.102 --> 02:24:05.687
It always does...

1264
02:24:05.813 --> 02:24:07.272
until it doesn't.

1265
02:24:09.024 --> 02:24:10.859
But you know that, don't you?

1266
02:27:35.522 --> 02:27:38.025
I'll tell you everything.

1267
02:27:43.322 --> 02:27:45.699
I'll tell you everything.

1268
02:28:37.501 --> 02:28:39.753
Helena's gonna be up soon.

1269
02:28:56.728 --> 02:29:00.941
She's expecting us 
to take her Christmas shopping today.

1270
02:29:25.716 --> 02:29:26.884
That's nice.

1271
02:29:27.050 --> 02:29:29.553
I could put Sabrina in here.

1272
02:29:30.345 --> 02:29:32.890
It's really pretty.

1273
02:29:33.098 --> 02:29:35.017
It's old-fashioned.

1274
02:29:44.234 --> 02:29:45.319
He's big.

1275
02:29:45.694 --> 02:29:49.031
I hope Santa Claus gets me
one of these for Christmas.

1276
02:29:49.156 --> 02:29:50.491
You do?

1277
02:29:52.743 --> 02:29:54.995
Well, you're gonna have to wait and see.

1278
02:30:09.259 --> 02:30:11.303
What do you think we should do?

1279
02:30:16.475 --> 02:30:17.768
What do I think we should do?

1280
02:30:18.185 --> 02:30:19.394
Look, Mommy!

1281
02:30:28.779 --> 02:30:31.448
What do I think?
I don't know.

1282
02:30:33.534 --> 02:30:35.410
I mean, maybe... 

1283
02:30:47.464 --> 02:30:50.884
Maybe I think...

1284
02:30:51.552 --> 02:30:53.929
we should be grateful.

1285
02:30:59.893 --> 02:31:01.520
Grateful...

1286
02:31:02.020 --> 02:31:07.151
that we've managed to survive 
through all of our...

1287
02:31:07.985 --> 02:31:09.570
adventures...

1288
02:31:12.114 --> 02:31:14.491
whether they were real...

1289
02:31:14.867 --> 02:31:17.119
or only a dream.

1290
02:31:26.545 --> 02:31:30.382
Are you sure of that?

1291
02:31:34.303 --> 02:31:35.929
Am I sure?

1292
02:31:51.695 --> 02:31:53.405
Only as sure as I am...

1293
02:31:53.697 --> 02:31:57.534
that the reality of one night...

1294
02:31:58.869 --> 02:32:01.622
let alone that of a whole lifetime...

1295
02:32:04.166 --> 02:32:06.668
can ever be the whole truth.

1296
02:32:13.425 --> 02:32:15.427
And no dream is ever...

1297
02:32:17.262 --> 02:32:18.972
just a dream.

1298
02:32:27.564 --> 02:32:29.566
The important thing is...

1299
02:32:31.485 --> 02:32:33.153
we're awake now...

1300
02:32:34.571 --> 02:32:36.865
and hopefully...

1301
02:32:39.910 --> 02:32:42.162
for a long time to come.

1302
02:32:45.791 --> 02:32:47.334
Forever.

1303
02:32:49.461 --> 02:32:50.921
Forever?

1304
02:32:53.298 --> 02:32:54.758
Forever.

1305
02:32:57.136 --> 02:33:00.764
Let's not use that word. You know?

1306
02:33:02.057 --> 02:33:04.017
It frightens me.

1307
02:33:14.361 --> 02:33:17.489
But I do love you...

1308
02:33:20.576 --> 02:33:22.161
and you know...

1309
02:33:23.412 --> 02:33:25.622
there is something very important...

1310
02:33:25.747 --> 02:33:28.542
that we need to do as soon as possible.

1311
02:33:29.710 --> 02:33:31.170
What's that?

1312
02:33:34.214 --> 02:33:35.674
