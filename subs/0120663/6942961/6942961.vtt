00:01:02.146 --> 00:01:04.440
Honey, have you seen my wallet?

2
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:08.152
Isn't it on the bedside table?

3
00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.203
Now listen, we're running a little late.

4
00:01:17.412 --> 00:01:18.454
I know.

5
00:01:19.163 --> 00:01:20.540
How do I look?

6
00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:22.208
Perfect.

7
00:01:22.458 --> 00:01:24.127
Is my hair okay?

8
00:01:24.586 --> 00:01:25.753
It's great.

9
00:01:25.962 --> 00:01:28.006
You're not even looking at it.

10
00:01:29.215 --> 00:01:30.675
It's beautiful.

11
00:01:31.134 --> 00:01:32.844
You always look beautiful.

12
00:01:33.303 --> 00:01:35.388
Did you give Roz the phone
and pager numbers?

13
00:01:35.597 --> 00:01:38.057
Yeah, I put it on the fridge.
Let's go.

14
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:39.267
Coming.

15
00:01:40.184 --> 00:01:41.686
All right.

16
00:01:41.936 --> 00:01:43.187
I'm ready.

17
00:02:00.204 --> 00:02:01.914
What's the babysitter's name?

18
00:02:02.081 --> 00:02:03.082
Roz.

19
00:02:05.627 --> 00:02:08.463
Okay, Roz, we're going now.

20
00:02:09.047 --> 00:02:11.549
You look amazing, Mrs. Harford.

21
00:02:11.716 --> 00:02:14.052
Thank you.
Helena, are you ready for bed?

22
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.888
Yes, Mommy. Can I stay up
and watch <i>The Nutcracker?</i>

23
00:02:17.096 --> 00:02:19.015
- What time's it on?
- 9:00.

24
00:02:19.223 --> 00:02:21.893
- You can watch that.
- Can I stay up until you get home?

25
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.146
- No, darling.
- It'll be a little late for that.

26
00:02:25.355 --> 00:02:27.607
The phone number is on the fridge...

27
00:02:27.815 --> 00:02:30.485
...and there's food in there,
so help yourself.

28
00:02:30.693 --> 00:02:32.445
We shouldn't be later than 1:00.

29
00:02:32.654 --> 00:02:35.365
- I'll hold our cab to take you home.
- Thanks, Dr. Harford.

30
00:02:35.573 --> 00:02:37.659
- You be good, baby.
- Good night, Daddy.

31
00:02:37.825 --> 00:02:40.578
- Good night, sweetheart.
- See you in the morning.

32
00:02:49.337 --> 00:02:53.132
- Victor, Illona.
- Bill, Alice.

33
00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:55.843
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you for coming.

34
00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.723
- Thanks so much for coming.
- We wouldn't miss it for the world.

35
00:03:00.932 --> 00:03:03.976
Alice, look at you.
God, you're absolutely stunning!

36
00:03:04.227 --> 00:03:06.145
I don't say that to all the women.
Do I?

37
00:03:06.354 --> 00:03:08.106
- Yes, he does.
- He does?

38
00:03:08.314 --> 00:03:11.275
That osteopath you sent me to,
the guy that worked on my arm?

39
00:03:11.484 --> 00:03:14.946
- You ought to see my serve now.
- He's the top man in New York.

40
00:03:15.113 --> 00:03:17.615
I could have told you that,
looking at his bill.

41
00:03:17.824 --> 00:03:20.243
Go inside, have a drink,
enjoy the party.

42
00:03:20.451 --> 00:03:23.162
I'll see you in a little bit.
Thanks for coming.

43
00:03:36.134 --> 00:03:38.177
Do you know anyone here?

44
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.014
Not a soul.

45
00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:54.318
Why do you think Ziegler invites us
to these things every year?

46
00:03:55.486 --> 00:03:59.991
This is what you get
for making house calls.

47
00:04:11.127 --> 00:04:13.296
You see that guy at the piano?

48
00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:17.008
I went to medical school with him.

49
00:04:17.592 --> 00:04:18.593
Really?

50
00:04:21.888 --> 00:04:24.390
He plays pretty good for a doctor.

51
00:04:25.183 --> 00:04:28.728
He's not a doctor. He dropped out.

52
00:04:31.731 --> 00:04:34.317
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hope you're enjoying yourselves.

53
00:04:34.525 --> 00:04:37.945
The band's gonna take a break.
We'll be back in 10 minutes.

54
00:04:38.696 --> 00:04:39.697
Thank you.

55
00:04:46.913 --> 00:04:48.790
Let's go over and say hello.

56
00:04:48.998 --> 00:04:51.375
I desperately need
to go to the bathroom.

57
00:04:51.584 --> 00:04:55.588
You go and say hello, and I'll
meet you where? At the bar?

58
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.215
Good.

59
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.060
Nightingale.

60
00:05:09.936 --> 00:05:11.103
Nick Nightingale!

61
00:05:11.312 --> 00:05:13.564
Oh, my God! Bill.

62
00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:17.068
Bill Harford!
How the hell are you, buddy?

63
00:05:17.235 --> 00:05:20.613
- How long has it been?
- I don't know. 10 years?

64
00:05:20.822 --> 00:05:22.198
And a couple.

65
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.617
- Do you have time for a drink?
- Sure.

66
00:05:28.746 --> 00:05:30.873
You haven't changed a bit.

67
00:05:31.082 --> 00:05:33.960
Thanks, I think.
So how you doing?

68
00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:36.921
Not too bad, you know. Not too bad.

69
00:05:37.088 --> 00:05:39.340
I see you've become a pianist.

70
00:05:39.549 --> 00:05:42.134
Oh, yes. Well, my friends call me that.

71
00:05:43.052 --> 00:05:45.596
How about you?
You still in the doctor business?

72
00:05:45.805 --> 00:05:49.809
You know what they say,
"Once a doctor, always a doctor."

73
00:05:50.017 --> 00:05:54.313
Yes, or in my case,
"Never a doctor, never a doctor."

74
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:57.567
I never did understand
why you walked away.

75
00:05:58.359 --> 00:06:00.695
It's a nice feeling. I do it a lot.

76
00:06:00.903 --> 00:06:02.113
Cheers.

77
00:06:02.697 --> 00:06:06.117
Excuse me.
Nick, I need you a minute.

78
00:06:06.325 --> 00:06:07.952
Be right with you.

79
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.788
I gotta go do something.
If I don't catch you later...

80
00:06:10.997 --> 00:06:14.792
...I'll be down at the Village
for two weeks at the Sonata Cafe.

81
00:06:15.042 --> 00:06:17.712
- Stop by if you get a chance.
- I'll be there.

82
00:06:18.546 --> 00:06:21.507
- It's great seeing you.
- Good seeing you too, man.

83
00:07:02.965 --> 00:07:06.427
I think that's my glass.

84
00:07:06.636 --> 00:07:09.764
Oh, I'm absolutely certain of it.

85
00:07:23.736 --> 00:07:27.782
My name is Sandor Szavost.
I'm Hungarian.

86
00:07:38.376 --> 00:07:40.836
My name is Alice Harford.

87
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.214
I'm American.

88
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:45.758
Delighted to meet you, Alice.

89
00:07:47.385 --> 00:07:52.139
Did you ever read the Latin poet Ovid
on <i>The Art of Love?</i>

90
00:07:54.225 --> 00:07:57.895
Didn't he wind up all by himself...

91
00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:00.898
...crying his eyes out...

92
00:08:01.065 --> 00:08:04.819
...in some place
with a very bad climate?

93
00:08:06.028 --> 00:08:08.948
But he also had a good time first.

94
00:08:09.407 --> 00:08:11.701
A very good time.

95
00:08:14.203 --> 00:08:16.956
Are you here
with anyone tonight, Alice?

96
00:08:20.084 --> 00:08:22.128
With my husband.

97
00:08:22.461 --> 00:08:24.422
Oh, how sad.

98
00:08:25.172 --> 00:08:30.094
But then I'm sure he's the sort of man
who wouldn't mind if we danced.

99
00:08:34.932 --> 00:08:37.101
What do you do, Alice?

100
00:08:37.643 --> 00:08:41.022
Well, at the moment...

101
00:08:41.814 --> 00:08:44.191
...I'm looking for a job.

102
00:08:45.401 --> 00:08:49.113
I used to manage
an art gallery in SoHo.

103
00:08:49.822 --> 00:08:51.949
But it went broke.

104
00:08:54.035 --> 00:08:55.536
What a shame.

105
00:08:57.288 --> 00:08:59.790
I have some friends in the art game.

106
00:09:00.499 --> 00:09:02.668
Perhaps I can be of some help.

107
00:09:06.464 --> 00:09:08.132
Thank you.

108
00:09:27.318 --> 00:09:28.903
Someone you know?

109
00:09:32.823 --> 00:09:34.450
My...

110
00:09:34.992 --> 00:09:36.577
...husband.

111
00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:44.293
Don't you think
one of the charms of marriage...

112
00:09:44.502 --> 00:09:49.173
...is that it makes deception
a necessity for both parties?

113
00:09:53.052 --> 00:09:55.679
May I ask why a beautiful woman...

114
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.850
...who could have any man in this room,
wants to be married?

115
00:10:02.812 --> 00:10:04.814
Why wouldn't she?

116
00:10:06.607 --> 00:10:08.692
Is it as bad as that?

117
00:10:09.985 --> 00:10:12.363
As good as that.

118
00:10:13.072 --> 00:10:14.865
Do you know Nuala Windsor?

119
00:10:15.074 --> 00:10:19.703
No, and it's very lovely
to meet you both.

120
00:10:21.705 --> 00:10:23.749
How do you spell Nuala?

121
00:10:24.333 --> 00:10:29.255
N-U-A-L-A.

122
00:10:31.048 --> 00:10:33.759
You don't remember me, do you?

123
00:10:34.969 --> 00:10:37.555
You were very kind to me once.

124
00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:41.517
Only once?
That sounds like a terrible oversight!

125
00:10:42.852 --> 00:10:47.064
I was doing a photo session
in Rockefeller Plaza...

126
00:10:47.273 --> 00:10:48.899
...on a very windy day...?

127
00:10:49.066 --> 00:10:53.279
- And you got something in your eye.
- Just about half of Fifth Avenue.

128
00:10:53.737 --> 00:10:57.241
You were such a gentleman!
You gave me your handkerchief...

129
00:10:57.449 --> 00:10:59.910
...which was also clean.

130
00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:05.332
Well, that is the kind of hero
I can be sometimes.

131
00:11:06.292 --> 00:11:09.420
You know why women used to get married,
don't you?

132
00:11:10.921 --> 00:11:13.132
Why don't you tell me?

133
00:11:14.925 --> 00:11:17.887
It was the only way they could
lose their virginity...

134
00:11:18.262 --> 00:11:21.891
...and be free to do
what they wanted with other men.

135
00:11:22.933 --> 00:11:25.144
The ones they really wanted.

136
00:11:29.773 --> 00:11:31.775
Fascinating.

137
00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:39.533
Do you know what's so nice
about doctors?

138
00:11:41.118 --> 00:11:44.622
Usually a lot less than people imagine.

139
00:11:46.332 --> 00:11:49.001
They always seem so...

140
00:11:49.877 --> 00:11:51.462
...knowledgeable.

141
00:11:52.463 --> 00:11:56.300
Oh, they are very knowledgeable...

142
00:11:56.508 --> 00:11:59.345
...about all sorts of things.

143
00:12:01.305 --> 00:12:03.474
But I bet they work too hard.

144
00:12:03.974 --> 00:12:07.770
Just think of all they miss.

145
00:12:08.646 --> 00:12:11.023
You're probably right.

146
00:12:12.024 --> 00:12:16.820
Ladies, where exactly are we going?

147
00:12:17.488 --> 00:12:19.031
Exactly?

148
00:12:21.492 --> 00:12:23.994
Where the rainbow ends.

149
00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.497
Where the rainbow ends?

150
00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:30.125
Don't you wanna go
where the rainbow ends?

151
00:12:30.334 --> 00:12:33.462
Now that depends where that is.

152
00:12:33.671 --> 00:12:35.339
Well, let's find out.

153
00:12:35.547 --> 00:12:38.384
Excuse me, ladies.
Sorry, Dr. Harford.

154
00:12:38.592 --> 00:12:42.888
Could you come with me for a moment?
Something for Mr. Ziegler.

155
00:12:45.224 --> 00:12:46.392
Fine.

156
00:12:48.143 --> 00:12:49.561
To be continued?

157
00:13:08.539 --> 00:13:09.873
Yeah.

158
00:13:12.376 --> 00:13:14.461
Bill, thanks for coming.

159
00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:19.300
We had a little accident here.

160
00:13:19.717 --> 00:13:21.093
What happened?

161
00:13:21.635 --> 00:13:23.554
Well, she was....

162
00:13:24.054 --> 00:13:28.225
She was shooting up
and she had a bad reaction.

163
00:13:30.019 --> 00:13:31.228
What did she take?

164
00:13:32.354 --> 00:13:35.733
A speedball or a snowball
or whatever the hell they call it.

165
00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:37.776
It's heroin and coke.

166
00:13:40.738 --> 00:13:42.740
Heroin and coke?

167
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.535
Anything else?

168
00:13:48.245 --> 00:13:51.457
We had a couple of drinks,
some champagne. That was it.

169
00:13:51.957 --> 00:13:53.625
How long has she been like this?

170
00:13:54.084 --> 00:13:57.338
Maybe five minutes, six minutes,
something like that.

171
00:13:57.546 --> 00:13:58.672
What's her name?

172
00:13:59.923 --> 00:14:02.426
Mandy. Mandy.

173
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.180
Mandy.

174
00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:09.099
Mandy?

175
00:14:10.559 --> 00:14:12.436
Can you hear me, Mandy?

176
00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:17.441
Can you hear me?
Move your head if you can hear me.

177
00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:22.029
Move your head if you can
hear me, Mandy. There you go.

178
00:14:22.237 --> 00:14:23.781
You can hear me.

179
00:14:23.989 --> 00:14:28.243
Can you open your eyes for me?
Mandy, can you do that?

180
00:14:28.952 --> 00:14:32.289
Let me see you open your eyes.
There you go, come on.

181
00:14:32.498 --> 00:14:35.459
Come on, look at me. Look at me.

182
00:14:36.043 --> 00:14:38.504
Look at me. Look at me.

183
00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.466
Look at me. Look at me, Mandy.

184
00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:45.135
Good.

185
00:14:46.637 --> 00:14:47.971
Good.

186
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:53.227
I love Victor's art collection,
don't you?

187
00:14:55.687 --> 00:14:59.066
Yes. It's wonderful.

188
00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:03.529
Have you ever seen
his sculpture gallery?

189
00:15:05.531 --> 00:15:09.576
No. I haven't.

190
00:15:10.369 --> 00:15:15.165
He has a wonderful collection
of Renaissance bronzes.

191
00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:19.461
Do you like the period?

192
00:15:22.714 --> 00:15:24.341
I do.

193
00:15:25.008 --> 00:15:27.177
I adore it.

194
00:15:29.263 --> 00:15:31.723
The sculpture gallery is upstairs.

195
00:15:33.183 --> 00:15:35.185
Would you like to see it?

196
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:40.023
I can show it to you.

197
00:15:43.652 --> 00:15:45.529
We won't be gone long.

198
00:15:52.995 --> 00:15:54.913
Maybe...

199
00:15:57.458 --> 00:16:00.586
...not just...

200
00:16:01.753 --> 00:16:03.505
...now.

201
00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:25.486
That was really one hell
of a scare you gave us, kiddo.

202
00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.405
Sorry.

203
00:16:37.414 --> 00:16:39.500
How are you feeling now, Mandy?

204
00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:42.669
Better.

205
00:16:52.346 --> 00:16:56.808
You are a very, very lucky girl.

206
00:16:57.935 --> 00:16:59.269
You know that?

207
00:17:01.522 --> 00:17:03.148
I know.

208
00:17:04.191 --> 00:17:06.485
You're gonna be okay this time.

209
00:17:07.778 --> 00:17:11.031
But you can't keep doing this.

210
00:17:11.782 --> 00:17:13.283
You understand?

211
00:17:15.661 --> 00:17:17.120
Yeah.

212
00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:21.542
You're gonna need some rehab.
You know that, don't you?

213
00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:24.962
I know.

214
00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.799
Okay.

215
00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:37.975
Well, Victor...

216
00:17:39.518 --> 00:17:41.144
...I'll leave the rest to you.

217
00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:44.022
Is it okay if I dress her
and get her out of here?

218
00:17:44.231 --> 00:17:47.985
No, I'd keep her here
for another hour.

219
00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:49.653
Another hour?

220
00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:54.491
Then I'd have someone take her home.

221
00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:58.745
Okay. Okay.

222
00:18:00.581 --> 00:18:04.042
- Good night, Mandy.
- Listen...

223
00:18:05.002 --> 00:18:07.254
...I can't thank you enough for this.

224
00:18:07.963 --> 00:18:10.215
- You saved my ass.
- I'm glad I was here.

225
00:18:10.424 --> 00:18:12.884
Bill, I probably....

226
00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:17.264
I know I don't have to mention this...

227
00:18:17.472 --> 00:18:20.392
...but this is just between us, okay?

228
00:18:20.851 --> 00:18:22.144
Of course.

229
00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:23.937
Thanks.

230
00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:49.546
I think I've had
a little too much champagne.

231
00:18:52.674 --> 00:18:56.261
I think I have to go
and find my husband now.

232
00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:01.099
But I'm sure he'll be all right
on his own a little longer.

233
00:19:03.602 --> 00:19:05.020
Yes...

234
00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:08.065
...but will I?

235
00:19:08.732 --> 00:19:10.442
Of course you will.

236
00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.489
No. No, no, no.

237
00:19:15.656 --> 00:19:19.409
I really have to go.
I have to go.

238
00:19:19.618 --> 00:19:21.411
You don't, you know.

239
00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.749
Yes, I do.

240
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.543
Alice.

241
00:19:31.088 --> 00:19:32.923
I must see you again.

242
00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:37.344
- That's impossible.
- Why?

243
00:19:38.804 --> 00:19:40.597
Because...

244
00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:45.435
...I'm married.

245
00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:51.835
Good morning, Lisa.

246
00:20:52.002 --> 00:20:54.129
Good morning, doctor.
Your mail.

247
00:20:54.296 --> 00:20:57.215
Good. Please ask Janelle
to bring me my coffee.

248
00:20:57.424 --> 00:20:59.009
- Sure.
- Thank you.

249
00:20:59.676 --> 00:21:02.637
- Good morning, Sarah.
- Good morning, doctor.

250
00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:05.849
<i>"'Twas the night before Christmas,
when all through the house...</i>

251
00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:08.935
<i>...not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse."</i>

252
00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:15.692
Okay. That's fine.
You can put your gown on.

253
00:21:20.405 --> 00:21:22.115
Hold this for Mommy.

254
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.119
- Looking forward to Christmas?
- Yeah.

255
00:21:26.578 --> 00:21:28.497
- Does this hurt?
- Yeah.

256
00:21:42.594 --> 00:21:45.055
- Right there?
- Yeah.

257
00:21:54.856 --> 00:21:56.775
Daddy's gonna like that.

258
00:21:57.442 --> 00:21:59.194
Very good choice.

259
00:21:59.986 --> 00:22:02.322
"--before me...

260
00:22:02.823 --> 00:22:07.744
...when I jump into my bed."

261
00:22:09.788 --> 00:22:13.959
We should call the Zieglers
and thank them for the party.

262
00:22:14.918 --> 00:22:16.753
I've taken care of that.

263
00:22:18.338 --> 00:22:19.756
Good.

264
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:24.094
So how do you feel about wrapping
the rest of the presents?

265
00:22:25.762 --> 00:22:27.973
Let's do that tomorrow.

266
00:23:14.019 --> 00:23:16.146
Tell me something.

267
00:23:20.859 --> 00:23:24.404
Those two girls...

268
00:23:26.239 --> 00:23:28.867
...at the party last night....

269
00:23:34.664 --> 00:23:36.708
Did you...

270
00:23:37.667 --> 00:23:40.086
...by any chance...

271
00:23:40.462 --> 00:23:42.797
...happen to...

272
00:23:44.466 --> 00:23:47.218
...fuck them?

273
00:23:49.888 --> 00:23:51.181
What?

274
00:23:54.184 --> 00:23:56.853
What are you talking about?

275
00:24:00.857 --> 00:24:04.527
I'm talking about the two girls...

276
00:24:04.778 --> 00:24:08.698
...that you were so blatantly
hitting on.

277
00:24:10.283 --> 00:24:13.370
I wasn't hitting on anybody.

278
00:24:16.456 --> 00:24:18.416
Who were they?

279
00:24:21.753 --> 00:24:25.382
They were just a couple of models.

280
00:24:29.469 --> 00:24:33.974
And where did you disappear to
with them for so long?

281
00:24:34.224 --> 00:24:36.643
Wait a minute.

282
00:24:37.227 --> 00:24:39.229
Wait a minute.

283
00:24:40.605 --> 00:24:44.526
I didn't disappear with anybody.

284
00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.990
Ziegler wasn't feeling too well...

285
00:24:50.824 --> 00:24:53.660
...and I got called upstairs
to see him.

286
00:24:57.497 --> 00:25:00.458
Anyway, who was the guy
you were dancing with?

287
00:25:06.589 --> 00:25:09.509
A friend of the Zieglers.

288
00:25:12.262 --> 00:25:13.596
What did he want?

289
00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:15.932
What did he want?

290
00:25:18.018 --> 00:25:20.395
What did he want?

291
00:25:22.647 --> 00:25:24.274
Sex...

292
00:25:26.317 --> 00:25:28.236
...upstairs.

293
00:25:29.279 --> 00:25:31.156
Then and there.

294
00:25:33.616 --> 00:25:35.160
Is that all?

295
00:25:35.577 --> 00:25:38.121
Yeah, that was all.

296
00:25:38.288 --> 00:25:41.082
Just wanted to fuck my wife.

297
00:25:45.378 --> 00:25:46.921
That's right.

298
00:25:47.297 --> 00:25:49.549
Well, I guess that's understandable.

299
00:25:52.552 --> 00:25:54.721
Understandable?

300
00:25:55.638 --> 00:25:57.766
Because you are a very...

301
00:25:58.767 --> 00:26:00.977
...very beautiful woman.

302
00:26:04.064 --> 00:26:07.317
Wait. So...

303
00:26:09.444 --> 00:26:11.154
...because I'm a beautiful woman...

304
00:26:11.321 --> 00:26:15.658
...the only reason any man
ever wants to talk to me...

305
00:26:17.452 --> 00:26:21.831
...is because he wants to fuck me.
Is that what you're saying?

306
00:26:24.334 --> 00:26:29.297
Well, I don't think it's quite
that black and white...

307
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:36.346
...but I think we both know
what men are like.

308
00:26:38.473 --> 00:26:40.350
So on that basis...

309
00:26:40.517 --> 00:26:45.480
...I should conclude that you
wanted to fuck those two models.

310
00:26:47.398 --> 00:26:50.443
There are exceptions.

311
00:26:52.153 --> 00:26:56.032
And what makes you an exception?

312
00:26:58.743 --> 00:27:02.455
What makes me an exception is that...

313
00:27:03.665 --> 00:27:06.084
...I happen to be in love with you.

314
00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:08.795
And because we're married...

315
00:27:09.003 --> 00:27:13.258
...and because I would never
lie to you...

316
00:27:13.967 --> 00:27:15.552
...or hurt you.

317
00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:27.355
Do you realize that
what you're saying...

318
00:27:27.564 --> 00:27:30.859
...is that the only reason you
wouldn't fuck those models...

319
00:27:31.067 --> 00:27:33.653
...is out of consideration for me?

320
00:27:33.862 --> 00:27:36.906
Not because you really
wouldn't want to.

321
00:27:37.282 --> 00:27:40.076
Let's just relax, Alice.

322
00:27:40.243 --> 00:27:42.871
This pot is making you aggressive.

323
00:27:43.079 --> 00:27:46.457
No! It's not the pot. It's you!

324
00:27:46.666 --> 00:27:49.294
Why can't you ever give me
a straight fucking answer?

325
00:27:49.502 --> 00:27:52.088
I was under the impression
that's what I was doing.

326
00:27:52.297 --> 00:27:55.508
I don't even know
what we're arguing about here.

327
00:27:55.717 --> 00:27:57.927
I'm not arguing.

328
00:27:58.636 --> 00:28:03.183
I'm just trying to find out
where you're coming from.

329
00:28:03.516 --> 00:28:05.143
Where I'm coming from?

330
00:28:08.313 --> 00:28:14.319
Let's say-- Let's say, for example,
you have some gorgeous woman...

331
00:28:14.736 --> 00:28:18.656
...standing in your office naked...

332
00:28:18.865 --> 00:28:21.576
...and you're feeling her fucking tits.

333
00:28:21.784 --> 00:28:23.578
Now, what I wanna know....

334
00:28:23.786 --> 00:28:28.708
I wanna know what you're thinking
about when you're squeezing them.

335
00:28:29.125 --> 00:28:33.129
Alice, I happen to be a doctor.

336
00:28:33.838 --> 00:28:35.882
It's all very impersonal...

337
00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:39.677
...and you know
there's always a nurse present.

338
00:28:40.261 --> 00:28:45.099
So when you're feeling tits, it's
nothing more than your professionalism?

339
00:28:45.308 --> 00:28:46.351
Exactly.

340
00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:51.147
Sex is the last thing on my mind
when I'm with a patient.

341
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.527
Now, when she is having
her little titties squeezed...

342
00:28:56.736 --> 00:28:59.030
...do you think she ever
has fantasies...

343
00:28:59.239 --> 00:29:03.534
...about what handsome Dr. Bill's
dickie might be like?

344
00:29:05.662 --> 00:29:09.916
Come on, I can assure you
sex is the last thing...

345
00:29:10.166 --> 00:29:14.337
...on this fucking hypothetical
woman patient's mind.

346
00:29:14.629 --> 00:29:16.506
And what makes you so sure?

347
00:29:21.469 --> 00:29:23.554
If for no better reason...

348
00:29:24.097 --> 00:29:27.058
...because she's afraid of
what I might find.

349
00:29:27.684 --> 00:29:32.730
Okay, okay. So after you tell her that
everything's fine, what then?

350
00:29:33.564 --> 00:29:35.191
What then?

351
00:29:36.609 --> 00:29:38.820
I don't know, Alice....

352
00:29:40.321 --> 00:29:41.614
What then?

353
00:29:42.699 --> 00:29:47.495
Look, women don't....

354
00:29:48.621 --> 00:29:52.208
They basically just don't
think like that.

355
00:29:54.502 --> 00:29:59.757
Millions of years of evolution, right?
Right?

356
00:29:59.924 --> 00:30:02.385
Men have to stick it
every place they can...

357
00:30:02.552 --> 00:30:05.763
...but for women, it is just about
security and commitment...

358
00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.224
...and whatever the fuck else!

359
00:30:08.474 --> 00:30:12.228
A little oversimplified, Alice.
But yes, something like that.

360
00:30:12.729 --> 00:30:16.399
If you men only knew.

361
00:30:17.692 --> 00:30:21.863
What I do know is you got stoned,
you tried to pick a fight...

362
00:30:22.071 --> 00:30:25.199
...and now you're trying
to make me jealous.

363
00:30:25.408 --> 00:30:27.493
But you're not the jealous type,
are you?

364
00:30:27.702 --> 00:30:28.911
No, I'm not.

365
00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.247
You've never been jealous about me,
have you?

366
00:30:31.414 --> 00:30:32.415
No, I haven't.

367
00:30:32.623 --> 00:30:35.084
And why haven't you ever
been jealous about me?

368
00:30:35.376 --> 00:30:39.297
Well, I don't know, Alice.
Maybe because you're my wife.

369
00:30:39.505 --> 00:30:41.883
Maybe because you're
the mother of my child...

370
00:30:42.091 --> 00:30:44.886
...and I know you would never
be unfaithful to me.

371
00:30:45.094 --> 00:30:49.390
You are very, very sure of yourself...

372
00:30:49.599 --> 00:30:50.933
...aren't you?

373
00:30:51.392 --> 00:30:52.560
No.

374
00:30:53.353 --> 00:30:55.104
I'm sure of you.

375
00:31:07.367 --> 00:31:09.202
Do you think that's funny?

376
00:31:18.211 --> 00:31:19.962
All right. Fuck it.

377
00:31:20.671 --> 00:31:24.509
Now we get
the fucking laughing fit, right?

378
00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.438
Do you...?

379
00:31:39.607 --> 00:31:43.277
Do you remember
last summer at Cape Cod?

380
00:31:47.156 --> 00:31:48.991
Yes.

381
00:31:50.201 --> 00:31:53.329
Do you remember one night
in the dining room...

382
00:31:53.496 --> 00:31:55.665
...there was this young naval officer...

383
00:31:55.873 --> 00:32:00.420
...and he was sitting near our table
with two other officers?

384
00:32:01.963 --> 00:32:03.005
No.

385
00:32:05.716 --> 00:32:09.846
The waiter brought him a message,
at which point he left.

386
00:32:10.054 --> 00:32:12.723
Nothing rings a bell?

387
00:32:13.766 --> 00:32:15.101
No.

388
00:32:19.439 --> 00:32:20.690
Well...

389
00:32:22.692 --> 00:32:26.696
...I first saw him
that morning in the lobby.

390
00:32:27.488 --> 00:32:30.158
He was checking into the hotel...

391
00:32:30.366 --> 00:32:33.870
...and he was following the bellboy
with his luggage...

392
00:32:34.579 --> 00:32:36.539
...to the elevator.

393
00:32:41.085 --> 00:32:45.548
He glanced at me as he walked past.
Just a glance.

394
00:32:46.757 --> 00:32:48.468
Nothing more.

395
00:32:55.808 --> 00:32:58.978
But I could hardly...

396
00:33:00.646 --> 00:33:02.190
...move.

397
00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.409
That afternoon...

398
00:33:15.703 --> 00:33:19.749
...Helena went to the movies
with her friend...

399
00:33:23.252 --> 00:33:25.588
...and you and I made love.

400
00:33:28.257 --> 00:33:33.179
And we made plans about our future...

401
00:33:34.388 --> 00:33:38.351
...and we talked about Helena.

402
00:33:40.102 --> 00:33:41.771
And yet...

403
00:33:42.939 --> 00:33:45.608
...at no time...

404
00:33:46.901 --> 00:33:49.529
...was he ever...

405
00:33:50.738 --> 00:33:54.534
...out of my mind.

406
00:33:59.956 --> 00:34:04.919
And I thought if he wanted me...

407
00:34:06.462 --> 00:34:09.257
...even if it was only...

408
00:34:10.841 --> 00:34:12.677
...for one night...

409
00:34:16.973 --> 00:34:20.685
...I was ready to give up everything:

410
00:34:22.436 --> 00:34:23.771
You...

411
00:34:26.482 --> 00:34:27.900
...Helena...

412
00:34:30.486 --> 00:34:34.240
...my whole fucking future.

413
00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:38.119
Everything.

414
00:34:44.709 --> 00:34:49.005
And yet it was weird,
because at the same time...

415
00:34:50.214 --> 00:34:52.967
...you were dearer to me than ever.

416
00:34:57.513 --> 00:35:00.516
And at that moment, my love for you...

417
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:04.437
...was both...

418
00:35:07.273 --> 00:35:11.902
...tender and sad.

419
00:35:22.872 --> 00:35:25.499
I barely slept that night...

420
00:35:28.044 --> 00:35:31.714
...and I woke up the next morning
in a panic.

421
00:35:33.966 --> 00:35:37.887
I didn't know whether I was
afraid that he had left...

422
00:35:39.263 --> 00:35:42.725
...or that he might still be there.

423
00:35:47.021 --> 00:35:50.274
But by dinner...

424
00:35:52.902 --> 00:35:56.739
...I realized he was gone...

425
00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:05.373
...and I was...

426
00:36:06.332 --> 00:36:08.417
...relieved.

427
00:36:33.734 --> 00:36:35.152
Hello.

428
00:36:37.405 --> 00:36:39.240
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

429
00:36:45.705 --> 00:36:47.289
When did it happen?

430
00:36:52.044 --> 00:36:55.798
No, no. I have the address.

431
00:36:56.632 --> 00:36:57.883
Thank you.

432
00:37:05.558 --> 00:37:07.768
Lou Nathanson just died.

433
00:37:16.318 --> 00:37:19.321
I think I have to go over there
and show my face.

434
00:38:13.209 --> 00:38:16.003
- Hello, Rosa.
- Good evening, Dr. Harford.

435
00:38:17.338 --> 00:38:21.217
- How is Miss Nathanson?
- Not so good. She's in the bedroom.

436
00:38:21.383 --> 00:38:22.510
Thank you.

437
00:38:37.858 --> 00:38:39.026
Come in.

438
00:38:45.199 --> 00:38:46.408
Marion....

439
00:38:48.285 --> 00:38:50.120
Oh, Dr. Harford....

440
00:38:50.955 --> 00:38:53.624
How good of you to come.

441
00:38:53.833 --> 00:38:56.293
I came as soon as I got the message.

442
00:38:56.502 --> 00:38:59.463
- Thank you.
- I'm so....

443
00:38:59.755 --> 00:39:01.966
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

444
00:39:02.174 --> 00:39:03.968
Your father was....

445
00:39:05.094 --> 00:39:07.930
He was a very brave man.

446
00:39:08.722 --> 00:39:10.224
Oh, thank you.

447
00:39:10.933 --> 00:39:12.643
How are you holding up?

448
00:39:14.979 --> 00:39:16.647
I'm a bit numb.

449
00:39:17.106 --> 00:39:19.984
I don't think it's really sunk in yet.

450
00:39:21.318 --> 00:39:23.362
Would you like to sit down?

451
00:39:53.142 --> 00:39:55.394
It's so unreal.

452
00:39:56.645 --> 00:39:58.689
Daddy had such a good day.

453
00:40:00.649 --> 00:40:05.321
His mind was clear,
and he remembered so many things.

454
00:40:08.407 --> 00:40:10.534
Then he had a little dinner...

455
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:14.163
...and he said he felt like
taking a nap.

456
00:40:15.456 --> 00:40:20.377
I went into the kitchen and talked
to Rosa for half an hour at most...

457
00:40:21.712 --> 00:40:24.840
...and when I went to see how he was...

458
00:40:25.049 --> 00:40:27.343
...I just thought he was asleep.

459
00:40:32.306 --> 00:40:36.352
Then I realized he wasn't breathing.

460
00:40:40.064 --> 00:40:43.776
Marion, from what you've said...

461
00:40:43.984 --> 00:40:48.030
...I'm sure your father died peacefully
in his sleep.

462
00:40:49.865 --> 00:40:51.992
Oh, God, I hope so.

463
00:40:54.203 --> 00:40:59.124
I think I've been more afraid of
the way it was going to happen...

464
00:40:59.833 --> 00:41:01.961
...than his death itself.

465
00:41:03.712 --> 00:41:06.548
Have you had a chance to phone
any of your relatives?

466
00:41:08.759 --> 00:41:13.138
I tried to call my stepmother in London,
but she was out.

467
00:41:13.681 --> 00:41:16.558
My boyfriend, Carl,
is making some calls...

468
00:41:16.767 --> 00:41:19.603
...and he'll be coming over soon.

469
00:41:24.149 --> 00:41:27.236
I think you've met Carl here
a few times.

470
00:41:28.654 --> 00:41:31.699
Yes, I remember him.
He's a teacher, isn't he?

471
00:41:31.907 --> 00:41:33.909
A math professor.

472
00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:40.624
We're going to get married in May.

473
00:41:42.543 --> 00:41:46.547
Well, that's wonderful news.
Congratulations.

474
00:41:50.342 --> 00:41:51.760
Thank you.

475
00:41:54.096 --> 00:41:58.058
Carl has a new teaching appointment
at the University of Michigan.

476
00:41:58.267 --> 00:42:00.394
We'll be moving out there soon.

477
00:42:01.103 --> 00:42:05.107
Michigan's a beautiful state.
I think you'll like it a lot.

478
00:42:07.985 --> 00:42:09.695
Yeah.

479
00:42:11.822 --> 00:42:14.825
It really could be a wonderful
change for you, Marion.

480
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:36.597
Oh, my God, no....

481
00:42:56.492 --> 00:42:58.243
I love you.

482
00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:02.289
I love you.

483
00:43:02.498 --> 00:43:05.167
I love you, I love you, I love you.

484
00:43:05.375 --> 00:43:08.337
I don't want to go away with Carl.

485
00:43:08.629 --> 00:43:10.672
Marion, I don't think you realize--

486
00:43:10.881 --> 00:43:12.174
I do.

487
00:43:12.508 --> 00:43:17.429
Even if I'm never to see you again,
I want at least to live near you.

488
00:43:18.263 --> 00:43:21.225
Marion, listen to me. Listen to me.

489
00:43:22.434 --> 00:43:27.356
You're very upset right now, and I don't
think you realize what you're saying.

490
00:43:29.066 --> 00:43:30.484
I love you.

491
00:43:31.944 --> 00:43:34.863
We barely know each other.

492
00:43:35.697 --> 00:43:39.535
We haven't had a single conversation
about anything except your father.

493
00:43:39.701 --> 00:43:41.411
I love you.

494
00:43:47.584 --> 00:43:49.419
That's probably Carl.

495
00:43:50.546 --> 00:43:52.881
Please don't despise me.

496
00:43:58.554 --> 00:44:00.722
- Hello, Rosa.
- Hello, Mr. Thomas.

497
00:44:02.391 --> 00:44:05.686
- Is she in the bedroom?
- Yes, she is.

498
00:44:05.894 --> 00:44:07.062
Thank you.

499
00:44:18.407 --> 00:44:19.408
Come in.

500
00:44:24.746 --> 00:44:25.998
Darling.

501
00:44:29.918 --> 00:44:32.087
I'm so very sorry.

502
00:44:32.921 --> 00:44:34.506
Are you all right?

503
00:44:35.048 --> 00:44:36.550
I'm okay.

504
00:44:38.594 --> 00:44:42.014
- Dr. Harford, good evening.
- Good evening, Carl.

505
00:44:42.222 --> 00:44:45.100
Thank you very much
for coming over here tonight.

506
00:44:45.309 --> 00:44:48.270
- It's the least I could do.
- It means a lot to us.

507
00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:49.646
Thank you.

508
00:44:54.484 --> 00:44:57.446
Well, I was actually on my way out.

509
00:45:00.282 --> 00:45:01.450
Marion...

510
00:45:02.868 --> 00:45:05.454
...your father was very proud of you...

511
00:45:05.621 --> 00:45:10.584
...and I know you gave him
great comfort these last months.

512
00:45:12.127 --> 00:45:15.255
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

513
00:45:19.843 --> 00:45:22.137
I'll show you out.

514
00:45:24.723 --> 00:45:25.974
Good night.

515
00:46:13.897 --> 00:46:16.316
Listen to this.
She had a red rose in her mouth.

516
00:46:16.525 --> 00:46:19.027
She was doing a Mexican lap dance
right in my face.

517
00:46:19.236 --> 00:46:22.656
I'm serious!
I got scars on the back of my neck.

518
00:46:22.823 --> 00:46:24.783
What team's this switch hitter
playing for?

519
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:27.327
- Looks like the pink team.
- Look at this faggot!

520
00:46:27.536 --> 00:46:29.288
Hey, watch it, you faggot!

521
00:46:29.496 --> 00:46:31.790
Merry Christmas, Mary!

522
00:46:31.999 --> 00:46:34.626
- Your butt-brothers are back there!
- Prime cut of meat!

523
00:46:34.835 --> 00:46:38.338
You wanna take a ride in this
fudge-tunnel, you stupid faggot?

524
00:46:39.381 --> 00:46:42.301
You should have tits,
you're standing so close!

525
00:46:42.509 --> 00:46:46.680
- I got dumps that are bigger than you!
- Come on, macho man!

526
00:46:46.888 --> 00:46:50.058
- You want a piece of this, baby?
- Exit only, honey.

527
00:46:50.434 --> 00:46:53.854
Go back to San Francisco
where you belong, man!

528
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:19.296
Excuse me.
Do you know what time it is?

529
00:47:20.255 --> 00:47:21.882
Ten past 12.

530
00:47:24.259 --> 00:47:26.136
Going anywhere special?

531
00:47:26.553 --> 00:47:29.598
No, I'm just taking a walk.

532
00:47:34.353 --> 00:47:36.688
How'd you like to have a little fun?

533
00:47:38.106 --> 00:47:39.608
I'm sorry?

534
00:47:41.068 --> 00:47:42.778
Have a little fun?

535
00:47:44.613 --> 00:47:46.615
I just live right down there.

536
00:47:47.282 --> 00:47:49.910
Would you like to come inside with me?

537
00:47:51.036 --> 00:47:55.207
- Come inside with you?
- Yeah.

538
00:47:55.916 --> 00:47:59.544
It's a lot nicer in there
than it is out here.

539
00:48:06.927 --> 00:48:08.512
You live in there?

540
00:48:09.012 --> 00:48:10.639
Yes.

541
00:48:11.515 --> 00:48:12.933
By yourself?

542
00:48:13.225 --> 00:48:15.977
No. I have a roommate,
but she's not home.

543
00:48:17.521 --> 00:48:18.897
Hey, it's okay.

544
00:48:19.689 --> 00:48:21.733
Listen, no one will bother us.

545
00:48:22.734 --> 00:48:24.277
It's okay. Come on.

546
00:48:25.028 --> 00:48:26.113
Come on.

547
00:48:52.431 --> 00:48:53.682
This is it.

548
00:48:57.769 --> 00:48:59.354
That's a nice tree.

549
00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:09.364
Sorry about the mess.
Maid's day off.

550
00:49:24.171 --> 00:49:25.547
It's...

551
00:49:26.715 --> 00:49:28.508
...cozy. It's a...

552
00:49:29.509 --> 00:49:30.844
...cozy place.

553
00:49:32.053 --> 00:49:33.388
It's okay.

554
00:49:40.812 --> 00:49:42.397
So....

555
00:49:49.237 --> 00:49:53.575
Do you suppose we
should talk about money?

556
00:49:54.409 --> 00:49:55.869
Yeah, I guess so.

557
00:49:57.496 --> 00:49:59.623
That depends on what you wanna do.

558
00:50:04.252 --> 00:50:05.670
What do you wanna do?

559
00:50:09.925 --> 00:50:11.718
Well, what do you recommend?

560
00:50:16.556 --> 00:50:18.266
What do I recommend?

561
00:50:32.864 --> 00:50:35.742
I'd rather not put it into words.

562
00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:40.789
How about you just leave it up to me?

563
00:50:41.248 --> 00:50:44.960
- I'm in your hands.
- Okay.

564
00:50:45.919 --> 00:50:48.505
And how does 150 sound?

565
00:50:49.506 --> 00:50:52.008
Sounds wonderful.

566
00:50:56.012 --> 00:50:59.933
Don't worry. I don't
keep track of the time.

567
00:51:07.774 --> 00:51:08.775
<i>Thank you.</i>

568
00:51:08.984 --> 00:51:09.985
Prego, prego.

569
00:51:10.151 --> 00:51:12.445
- Grazie.
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

570
00:51:13.363 --> 00:51:15.907
<i>If I was Italian, he'd have
answered me in Italian.</i>

571
00:51:56.197 --> 00:51:57.866
So...

572
00:52:00.201 --> 00:52:01.494
...shall we?

573
00:52:19.929 --> 00:52:21.264
Excuse me.

574
00:52:31.274 --> 00:52:32.400
Hello.

575
00:52:33.318 --> 00:52:34.527
Hi.

576
00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:37.405
Hi. Is everything all right?

577
00:52:38.239 --> 00:52:40.867
Yeah. I was....

578
00:52:41.242 --> 00:52:44.537
I was just wondering if you
were gonna be much longer.

579
00:52:46.122 --> 00:52:51.086
Listen, it's a little difficult
to talk right now.

580
00:52:51.878 --> 00:52:53.713
It could be a while.

581
00:52:55.256 --> 00:52:57.425
Any idea how long?

582
00:52:58.218 --> 00:53:00.637
No, I don't really know.

583
00:53:01.012 --> 00:53:03.807
We're still waiting
for some relatives to arrive.

584
00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:10.105
Well, I'm gonna go to bed now.

585
00:53:10.647 --> 00:53:13.858
Okay. Bye-bye.

586
00:53:28.456 --> 00:53:32.127
Was that Mrs. Dr. Bill?

587
00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:44.597
Yes. Yes.

588
00:53:52.439 --> 00:53:53.982
Do you have to go?

589
00:53:55.233 --> 00:53:57.360
Do I have to go?

590
00:54:02.031 --> 00:54:03.658
I think I do.

591
00:54:06.494 --> 00:54:07.912
Are you sure?

592
00:54:14.085 --> 00:54:16.337
Yes, I'm afraid so.

593
00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:22.427
But listen, I wanna pay you anyway.

594
00:54:23.011 --> 00:54:27.348
How much did you say it was?
Hundred and fifty?

595
00:54:28.057 --> 00:54:29.601
Yeah.

596
00:54:31.227 --> 00:54:34.814
But you know what? You don't
have to bother about that.

597
00:54:35.023 --> 00:54:36.483
No, it's all right.

598
00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:40.528
- No, really. You don't have to.
- No, I want to.

599
00:54:43.072 --> 00:54:45.283
- Really?
- Really.

600
00:54:46.701 --> 00:54:48.620
Well, thank you very much.

601
00:55:33.414 --> 00:55:34.541
Thank you.

602
00:55:49.055 --> 00:55:52.433
Good evening. Would you like a table
or would you like to sit at the bar?

603
00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:55.436
- I'd like a table.
- Please follow me.

604
00:56:03.528 --> 00:56:05.780
- Can I take your coat?
- Thank you.

605
00:56:06.906 --> 00:56:08.908
Could I get you anything to drink?

606
00:56:10.076 --> 00:56:12.453
- I'd like a beer.
- Certainly.

607
00:56:23.172 --> 00:56:25.425
One, two, one-two-three-four.

608
00:56:26.676 --> 00:56:28.887
That's it for tonight,
ladies and gentlemen.

609
00:56:29.095 --> 00:56:33.808
On the bass, Mr. Larry McVey.
On the drums, Kip Fleming.

610
00:56:34.017 --> 00:56:38.146
And on the guitar,
the one, the only, Mr. Bobby Berman.

611
00:56:38.313 --> 00:56:42.525
We'll be here for the next two weeks,
so please do stop by.

612
00:56:42.734 --> 00:56:45.320
I'm Nick Nightingale. Good night.

613
00:56:55.747 --> 00:56:58.333
- Nick, that was great.
- Thanks.

614
00:56:58.666 --> 00:57:02.003
- Nightingale.
- Hey, Bill, you made it.

615
00:57:02.211 --> 00:57:05.715
I'm sorry, I got here just as you
were finishing your last set.

616
00:57:05.924 --> 00:57:08.968
That's all right.
The band sucked tonight anyway.

617
00:57:09.677 --> 00:57:12.847
- What are you drinking?
- A vodka and tonic, please.

618
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:15.433
Thank you.

619
00:57:17.185 --> 00:57:19.520
So what brings you out at this hour?

620
00:57:19.687 --> 00:57:22.857
- I have a patient in the neighborhood.
- You live in the Village?

621
00:57:23.066 --> 00:57:26.027
No, we have an apartment
on Central Park West.

622
00:57:26.194 --> 00:57:27.570
You're married?

623
00:57:28.237 --> 00:57:29.614
Nine years.

624
00:57:30.031 --> 00:57:32.951
- Any kids?
- Yes, we have a 7-year-old daughter.

625
00:57:33.159 --> 00:57:34.243
How about you?

626
00:57:34.452 --> 00:57:37.038
I've got a wife
and four boys in Seattle.

627
00:57:37.246 --> 00:57:38.706
You're a long way from home.

628
00:57:39.082 --> 00:57:41.793
Well, you gotta go where the work is.

629
00:57:42.585 --> 00:57:43.628
Thank you.

630
00:57:49.717 --> 00:57:52.178
- So is this your band?
- No, it's a pick-up band.

631
00:57:52.387 --> 00:57:56.391
- Who do you normally play with?
- Anybody, anywhere.

632
00:57:56.641 --> 00:57:59.060
I got another gig later tonight.

633
00:57:59.268 --> 00:58:01.229
You're playing somewhere else tonight?

634
00:58:01.396 --> 00:58:03.106
They only get started around 2.

635
00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:05.108
In the Village?

636
00:58:07.318 --> 00:58:10.738
Believe it or not, I don't actually
know the address yet.

637
00:58:11.239 --> 00:58:12.240
You don't?

638
00:58:12.907 --> 00:58:17.620
No. It may sound ridiculous, but it's
in a different place every time...

639
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:20.665
...and I only get it
an hour or so before.

640
00:58:20.873 --> 00:58:23.584
- A different place every time?
- So far.

641
00:58:24.669 --> 00:58:25.920
What's the big mystery?

642
00:58:26.671 --> 00:58:29.924
Hey, man, I just play the piano.

643
00:58:33.636 --> 00:58:36.889
Nick, I'm sorry.
Is there something I'm missing here?

644
00:58:39.892 --> 00:58:42.729
I play blindfolded.

645
00:58:43.855 --> 00:58:45.064
What?

646
00:58:46.858 --> 00:58:49.485
I play blindfolded.

647
00:58:53.531 --> 00:58:55.074
You're putting me on.

648
00:58:55.283 --> 00:58:57.785
No, it's the truth.

649
00:58:58.703 --> 00:59:03.374
And the last time,
the blindfold wasn't on so well.

650
00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:07.462
Oh, man.

651
00:59:08.629 --> 00:59:12.925
Bill, I have seen one or two things
in my life...

652
00:59:13.301 --> 00:59:14.969
...but never...

653
00:59:15.344 --> 00:59:17.805
...never anything like this...

654
00:59:18.556 --> 00:59:21.642
...and never such women.

655
00:59:29.025 --> 00:59:30.568
Well....

656
00:59:31.819 --> 00:59:33.154
Excuse me.

657
00:59:35.406 --> 00:59:36.783
Hello.

658
00:59:36.949 --> 00:59:39.994
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, this is Nick.

659
00:59:45.875 --> 00:59:47.710
I know where that is.

660
00:59:55.301 --> 00:59:56.302
Right.

661
00:59:58.262 --> 01:00:01.808
Okay. Well, I'm on my way right now.

662
01:00:02.558 --> 01:00:05.061
Okay, sir. Thank you. Bye-bye.

663
01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.856
What is this?

664
01:00:10.358 --> 01:00:13.027
It's the name of a Beethoven opera,
isn't it?

665
01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:15.113
Nick.

666
01:00:17.865 --> 01:00:19.534
It's the password.

667
01:00:20.201 --> 01:00:21.702
The password?

668
01:00:23.037 --> 01:00:26.666
Yeah. Look, I'm really sorry
to do this to you, Bill.

669
01:00:27.708 --> 01:00:31.546
I gotta get going. I gotta go.

670
01:00:33.464 --> 01:00:34.924
Nick...

671
01:00:36.551 --> 01:00:40.555
...you know there is no way on earth...

672
01:00:41.055 --> 01:00:44.559
...that you are going to leave here
without taking me with you.

673
01:00:45.184 --> 01:00:48.896
- Come on, buddy, give me a break.
- Nick, I'll tell you what.

674
01:00:49.063 --> 01:00:52.316
I've already got the password.

675
01:00:53.192 --> 01:00:56.404
Just give me the address.
I'll go there by myself...

676
01:00:56.612 --> 01:01:00.241
...and there won't be any connection
between us whatsoever.

677
01:01:02.869 --> 01:01:07.081
Listen, let's just say
for one second...

678
01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:10.209
...that I was prepared to do that.

679
01:01:10.585 --> 01:01:13.880
You couldn't get in anyway
in those clothes.

680
01:01:15.089 --> 01:01:16.424
Why not?

681
01:01:16.924 --> 01:01:21.137
Because everyone is always
costumed and masked.

682
01:01:22.013 --> 01:01:25.683
Where the hell are you gonna
get a costume at this hour?

683
01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:47.788
Thanks. Keep the change.

684
01:02:00.885 --> 01:02:03.221
<i>Yes? Who is it?</i>

685
01:02:03.429 --> 01:02:05.181
Peter, this is Bill Harford.

686
01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:09.810
I apologize for disturbing you
at this late hour, but I need your help.

687
01:02:10.937 --> 01:02:12.855
<i>Who is it that you want?</i>

688
01:02:14.482 --> 01:02:17.401
I'm very sorry.
I'm looking for Peter Grenning...

689
01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:20.112
...the owner of Rainbow Fashions.

690
01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.699
<i>What's your name?</i>

691
01:02:23.908 --> 01:02:26.327
My name is Bill Harford.

692
01:02:26.494 --> 01:02:28.704
I'm Mr. Grenning's doctor.

693
01:02:29.705 --> 01:02:33.542
<i>- You are Grenning's doctor?</i>
- Yes.

694
01:02:34.794 --> 01:02:35.962
<i>Okay.</i>

695
01:02:36.504 --> 01:02:38.005
<i>Just a moment.</i>

696
01:02:53.187 --> 01:02:55.231
You are looking for Peter Grenning?

697
01:02:55.731 --> 01:02:57.024
Yes, I am.

698
01:02:57.483 --> 01:03:01.362
He moved to Chicago over a year ago.

699
01:03:02.196 --> 01:03:04.407
He moved to Chicago?

700
01:03:07.076 --> 01:03:09.120
I wasn't aware of that.

701
01:03:11.038 --> 01:03:14.667
Then are you the present owner
of Rainbow Fashions?

702
01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:16.502
Yes, I am.

703
01:03:16.877 --> 01:03:17.878
Well, first of all...

704
01:03:18.087 --> 01:03:23.009
...please let me apologize again
for disturbing you at this hour, Mr....

705
01:03:23.217 --> 01:03:24.427
Milich.

706
01:03:24.635 --> 01:03:28.806
Mr. Milich. Just to let you know
that I really am Dr. Harford...

707
01:03:29.015 --> 01:03:32.018
...this is my New York State
Medical Board card.

708
01:03:32.893 --> 01:03:35.896
Okay, so you are Dr. Harford.

709
01:03:36.105 --> 01:03:39.525
If I see Peter, I tell him
you were looking for him.

710
01:03:39.734 --> 01:03:41.902
Oh, no, wait. Please, please....

711
01:03:42.486 --> 01:03:45.990
Listen, the reason that
I came here tonight was....

712
01:03:48.075 --> 01:03:52.955
Basically, the reason is
that I need a costume.

713
01:03:53.414 --> 01:03:57.251
And I'd be happy to pay you
$100 over the rental price...

714
01:03:57.418 --> 01:03:59.045
...for the inconvenience.

715
01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:04.008
- A hundred dollars?
- Yes.

716
01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.428
I don't think so.

717
01:04:09.472 --> 01:04:12.725
Okay. How about $200?

718
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:15.936
Two hundred dollars
over the rental price?

719
01:04:16.604 --> 01:04:17.897
Yes.

720
01:04:18.856 --> 01:04:20.608
Okay.

721
01:04:27.782 --> 01:04:28.949
Come in.

722
01:04:33.454 --> 01:04:36.082
Can't be too careful these days.

723
01:04:39.293 --> 01:04:40.419
Please.

724
01:04:43.214 --> 01:04:45.966
Is it any special costume
you are looking for?

725
01:04:46.133 --> 01:04:47.802
Yes.

726
01:04:49.178 --> 01:04:54.141
I need a tux, a cloak with a hood
and a mask.

727
01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:59.605
- A cloak with a hood and a mask?
- Yes.

728
01:04:59.772 --> 01:05:04.068
Okay, I think we'll find something for you.

729
01:05:04.819 --> 01:05:06.487
Follow me, please.

730
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:08.030
Good.

731
01:05:16.997 --> 01:05:20.751
- Looks like alive, huh?
- Yes.

732
01:05:20.918 --> 01:05:22.920
- It's wonderful.
- Come.

733
01:05:24.004 --> 01:05:26.215
So what color cloak?

734
01:05:27.675 --> 01:05:29.385
Red, brown, red?

735
01:05:30.803 --> 01:05:31.887
Black.

736
01:05:32.096 --> 01:05:35.599
The good doctor wouldn't
like something more colorful?

737
01:05:35.808 --> 01:05:38.519
- I don't think so.
- Clowns, officers, pirates?

738
01:05:38.686 --> 01:05:41.355
No, just the tux, the black cloak--

739
01:05:41.564 --> 01:05:43.691
With a hood and a mask.

740
01:05:43.858 --> 01:05:46.068
- Yes.
- Okay.

741
01:05:46.235 --> 01:05:47.778
May I take your coat?

742
01:05:49.655 --> 01:05:52.950
- You are medicine doctor, yes?
- Yes, I am.

743
01:05:53.909 --> 01:05:57.746
- I have some problem with my hair.
- Your hair?

744
01:05:57.955 --> 01:06:00.040
It's starting to fall down too fast.

745
01:06:00.207 --> 01:06:03.169
I lost, in two weeks, a lot of hair.
Mostly here.

746
01:06:03.377 --> 01:06:05.379
Look at this. Here.

747
01:06:06.714 --> 01:06:08.340
- You see?
- Yes.

748
01:06:08.507 --> 01:06:09.675
And?

749
01:06:10.551 --> 01:06:12.845
I'm afraid this really isn't my field.

750
01:06:13.053 --> 01:06:15.014
What? You can't help me?

751
01:06:15.222 --> 01:06:18.809
No. You should see a trichologist.
It's a hair specialist.

752
01:06:19.018 --> 01:06:22.646
Mr. Milich, I've obviously
left things a bit late tonight.

753
01:06:22.855 --> 01:06:24.690
- So if you don't mind--
- Okay, okay.

754
01:06:24.857 --> 01:06:26.859
I'm in hurry too, to get back to bed.

755
01:06:27.067 --> 01:06:28.402
I understand.

756
01:06:29.403 --> 01:06:30.905
So black cloak?

757
01:06:35.868 --> 01:06:37.244
Did you hear something?

758
01:06:39.079 --> 01:06:40.414
Yes.

759
01:06:40.581 --> 01:06:42.166
What is this?

760
01:06:51.842 --> 01:06:53.677
What is it?

761
01:06:58.766 --> 01:07:00.768
What is this?

762
01:07:14.448 --> 01:07:17.117
What on earth is going on here?!

763
01:07:17.326 --> 01:07:19.453
Milich, I can explain everything.

764
01:07:19.662 --> 01:07:21.956
You! What are you doing here?

765
01:07:22.164 --> 01:07:23.958
I promise I'll kill you!

766
01:07:24.166 --> 01:07:28.087
And you!
Have you no sense of decency?

767
01:07:28.295 --> 01:07:32.132
Gentlemen, have you
no sense of decency?!

768
01:07:32.299 --> 01:07:35.970
Milich, are you crazy? We were
invited here by the young lady.

769
01:07:36.136 --> 01:07:40.516
Young lady? This is my daughter!
Couldn't you see she's a child?

770
01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:43.519
- You will have to explain to police!
- To the police?!

771
01:07:43.727 --> 01:07:46.605
You little whore!
I kill you for this.

772
01:07:46.814 --> 01:07:50.317
I promise, I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

773
01:07:50.526 --> 01:07:52.736
Hold on to that girl for me, please!

774
01:07:52.945 --> 01:07:56.907
Milich, this is preposterous.
The young lady invited us here.

775
01:07:57.116 --> 01:07:59.201
Couldn't you see she is deranged?!

776
01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:04.081
Doctor, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
Gentlemen, this is now a police matter.

777
01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:06.875
You will please stay here
until I return.

778
01:08:07.084 --> 01:08:08.752
Let us out of here!

779
01:08:08.961 --> 01:08:10.879
That's out of the question.

780
01:08:11.088 --> 01:08:14.717
Doctor, sorry,
what color did you say?

781
01:08:14.925 --> 01:08:16.510
- Black?
- Black.

782
01:08:17.136 --> 01:08:20.764
Gentlemen, please have the goodness
to be quiet for the moment!

783
01:08:20.973 --> 01:08:23.225
Couldn't you see
I try to serve my customer?

784
01:08:23.392 --> 01:08:24.393
Sorry.

785
01:08:24.977 --> 01:08:28.522
And you, little whore, go to bed
at once, you depraved creature.

786
01:08:28.731 --> 01:08:31.191
I'll deal with you
after I serve this gentleman.

787
01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:34.695
You should have a cloak
lined with ermine.

788
01:10:21.593 --> 01:10:23.721
Okay, that's $74.50.

789
01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:28.308
Seventy-four fifty. All right.

790
01:10:29.476 --> 01:10:30.978
There's 80.

791
01:10:31.437 --> 01:10:34.314
I promised you 50 bucks
over the meter, right?

792
01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:40.028
I'll make that a hundred,
if you wait for me.

793
01:10:40.237 --> 01:10:41.822
Just let the meter run.

794
01:10:41.989 --> 01:10:45.367
I'll give you the other half
plus the meter when I get back.

795
01:10:45.576 --> 01:10:48.203
- Okay?
- How long you gonna be?

796
01:10:48.412 --> 01:10:51.832
I don't know, maybe an hour or more.
But maybe only 10 minutes.

797
01:10:53.041 --> 01:10:55.002
I'll leave my stuff here in the back.

798
01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:00.674
- Okay?
- Okay.

799
01:11:12.853 --> 01:11:14.229
Good evening, sir.

800
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:16.482
Good evening.

801
01:11:17.107 --> 01:11:18.484
Can we be of any help?

802
01:11:20.194 --> 01:11:22.112
I suppose you'd like the password.

803
01:11:22.362 --> 01:11:23.947
If you'd like, sir.

804
01:11:24.198 --> 01:11:25.199
Fidelio.

805
01:11:25.407 --> 01:11:28.535
Thank you, sir.
We'll run you up to the house.

806
01:12:08.575 --> 01:12:10.244
Good evening, sir.

807
01:12:10.452 --> 01:12:11.787
Good evening.

808
01:12:12.162 --> 01:12:13.705
Password, sir?

809
01:12:14.581 --> 01:12:15.582
Fidelio.

810
01:12:16.083 --> 01:12:17.584
Thank you, sir.

811
01:18:22.991 --> 01:18:25.952
I'm not sure what you
think you're doing.

812
01:18:26.161 --> 01:18:28.205
But you don't belong here.

813
01:18:29.122 --> 01:18:34.002
I'm sorry, but I think you've
mistaken me for someone else.

814
01:18:37.422 --> 01:18:40.425
Please! Don't be foolish.

815
01:18:41.092 --> 01:18:42.844
You must go now.

816
01:18:47.682 --> 01:18:48.934
Who are you?

817
01:18:49.142 --> 01:18:51.311
It doesn't matter who I am.

818
01:18:52.062 --> 01:18:54.314
You are in great danger.

819
01:18:55.232 --> 01:18:58.026
You must get away
while there's still a chance.

820
01:19:02.322 --> 01:19:05.325
Would you be so good
as to excuse us for a moment?

821
01:22:04.337 --> 01:22:06.840
Have you been enjoying yourself?

822
01:22:08.675 --> 01:22:12.345
Well, I've had a very
interesting look around.

823
01:22:15.014 --> 01:22:18.518
Do you wanna go somewhere
a little more private?

824
01:22:21.896 --> 01:22:23.022
Private?

825
01:22:25.733 --> 01:22:27.402
That might be a good idea.

826
01:22:27.610 --> 01:22:32.365
Oh, here you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

827
01:22:34.242 --> 01:22:36.369
May I borrow him
for just a few minutes?

828
01:22:36.536 --> 01:22:39.038
I promise to bring him right back.

829
01:22:49.215 --> 01:22:52.177
I don't think you realize
the danger you're in now.

830
01:22:52.385 --> 01:22:54.387
You can't fool them for much longer.

831
01:22:54.596 --> 01:22:57.557
You've got to get away
before it's too late.

832
01:22:59.476 --> 01:23:01.561
Why are you telling me this?

833
01:23:01.895 --> 01:23:03.730
It doesn't matter.

834
01:23:04.063 --> 01:23:05.064
Who are you?

835
01:23:06.774 --> 01:23:10.987
You don't want to know.
But you must go. Now!

836
01:23:12.739 --> 01:23:14.407
Will you come with me?

837
01:23:14.574 --> 01:23:16.326
That's impossible.

838
01:23:16.534 --> 01:23:17.577
Why?

839
01:23:17.785 --> 01:23:22.040
Because it could cost me my life
and possibly yours.

840
01:23:23.416 --> 01:23:26.085
- Let me see your face.
- No!

841
01:23:26.794 --> 01:23:27.921
Go!

842
01:23:30.089 --> 01:23:31.674
Excuse me, sir.

843
01:23:34.844 --> 01:23:38.264
Are you the gentleman
with the taxi waiting for him?

844
01:23:39.766 --> 01:23:40.934
Yes.

845
01:23:41.142 --> 01:23:45.355
Your driver's at the front door and
would urgently like a word with you.

846
01:24:47.542 --> 01:24:51.087
Please, come forward.

847
01:25:23.328 --> 01:25:26.664
May I have the password, please?

848
01:25:29.375 --> 01:25:30.710
Fidelio.

849
01:25:31.419 --> 01:25:35.923
That's right, sir.
That is the password...

850
01:25:36.132 --> 01:25:37.925
...for admittance.

851
01:25:38.885 --> 01:25:43.640
But may I ask, what is the password
for the house?

852
01:25:49.228 --> 01:25:52.231
The password for the house?

853
01:25:52.857 --> 01:25:54.734
Yes.

854
01:26:03.576 --> 01:26:05.078
I'm sorry, I....

855
01:26:11.709 --> 01:26:13.294
I seem to have...

856
01:26:15.088 --> 01:26:16.589
...forgotten it.

857
01:26:18.424 --> 01:26:20.760
That's unfortunate.

858
01:26:21.594 --> 01:26:26.516
Because here, it doesn't matter
whether you have forgotten it...

859
01:26:26.933 --> 01:26:29.602
...or if you never knew it.

860
01:26:30.895 --> 01:26:34.941
You will kindly remove your mask.

861
01:26:55.503 --> 01:26:56.754
Now...

862
01:26:57.463 --> 01:26:59.048
...get undressed.

863
01:27:05.388 --> 01:27:08.683
Get undressed?

864
01:27:09.892 --> 01:27:13.062
Remove your clothes.

865
01:27:24.699 --> 01:27:27.994
Gentlemen, please....

866
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:33.541
Remove your clothes.

867
01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:37.670
Or would you like us to do it for you?

868
01:27:39.172 --> 01:27:40.298
Stop!

869
01:27:46.179 --> 01:27:48.973
Let him go.

870
01:27:50.975 --> 01:27:52.685
Take me!

871
01:27:54.187 --> 01:27:57.732
I am ready to redeem him.

872
01:28:03.863 --> 01:28:07.700
You are ready to redeem him?

873
01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:11.120
Yes.

874
01:28:14.081 --> 01:28:18.169
Are you sure you understand
what you're taking upon yourself...

875
01:28:18.503 --> 01:28:20.505
...in doing this?

876
01:28:21.923 --> 01:28:23.299
Yes.

877
01:28:29.972 --> 01:28:31.349
Very well.

878
01:28:36.479 --> 01:28:38.231
You are free.

879
01:28:40.149 --> 01:28:41.859
But I warn you...

880
01:28:42.485 --> 01:28:45.071
...if you make any further inquiries...

881
01:28:45.238 --> 01:28:49.242
...or if you say a single word
to anyone...

882
01:28:49.450 --> 01:28:52.161
...about what you have seen...

883
01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:56.874
...there will be the most
dire consequences for you...

884
01:28:57.083 --> 01:28:59.085
...and your family.

885
01:29:00.837 --> 01:29:02.964
Do you understand?

886
01:29:42.795 --> 01:29:45.256
What is gonna happen to that woman?

887
01:29:46.132 --> 01:29:49.135
No one can change her fate now.

888
01:29:50.136 --> 01:29:52.722
When a promise has been made here...

889
01:29:53.639 --> 01:29:56.142
...there is no turning back.

890
01:29:57.393 --> 01:29:58.686
Go!

891
01:32:02.226 --> 01:32:03.602
Alice.

892
01:32:05.438 --> 01:32:10.192
Alice. It's okay. It's okay.

893
01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:12.862
I'm sorry.

894
01:32:13.362 --> 01:32:17.950
I'm sorry I woke you up, but I thought
you were having a nightmare.

895
01:32:18.492 --> 01:32:19.994
Oh, God.

896
01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:23.998
I just had such a horrible dream.

897
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:27.376
What time is it?

898
01:32:27.793 --> 01:32:29.670
It's a little after 4.

899
01:32:32.465 --> 01:32:36.385
- Did you just get home?
- Yes.

900
01:32:37.136 --> 01:32:40.890
It took longer than I thought.

901
01:32:41.265 --> 01:32:43.476
You must be exhausted.

902
01:32:44.101 --> 01:32:49.690
Come on, lie down. Lie down.

903
01:32:56.197 --> 01:32:57.948
What were you dreaming?

904
01:33:04.163 --> 01:33:07.083
Just these weird things.

905
01:33:07.333 --> 01:33:08.793
What was it?

906
01:33:12.463 --> 01:33:15.174
It was so weird.

907
01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:19.053
Tell me.

908
01:33:40.032 --> 01:33:43.369
We were in a deserted city...

909
01:33:48.374 --> 01:33:50.876
...and our clothes were gone.

910
01:33:52.753 --> 01:33:54.713
We were naked...

911
01:34:00.219 --> 01:34:02.847
...and I was terrified...

912
01:34:07.852 --> 01:34:10.312
...and I felt ashamed.

913
01:34:11.397 --> 01:34:13.065
Oh, God....

914
01:34:17.361 --> 01:34:21.407
And I was angry because
I thought it was your fault.

915
01:34:24.076 --> 01:34:28.372
You rushed away to go
find clothes for us.

916
01:34:32.751 --> 01:34:36.755
As soon as you were gone,
it was completely different.

917
01:34:41.010 --> 01:34:43.012
I felt wonderful.

918
01:34:47.474 --> 01:34:52.188
Then I was lying
in a beautiful garden...

919
01:34:52.688 --> 01:34:55.858
...stretched out naked
in the sunlight...

920
01:35:00.821 --> 01:35:03.741
...and a man walked out of the woods.

921
01:35:07.953 --> 01:35:12.291
He was the man from the hotel,
the one I told you about.

922
01:35:14.919 --> 01:35:16.795
The naval officer.

923
01:35:21.675 --> 01:35:23.844
He stared at me...

924
01:35:28.849 --> 01:35:31.018
...and then he just laughed.

925
01:35:33.979 --> 01:35:36.106
He just laughed at me.

926
01:35:52.373 --> 01:35:54.166
But that's not the end...

927
01:35:55.251 --> 01:35:56.502
...is it?

928
01:35:58.295 --> 01:35:59.922
No.

929
01:36:02.299 --> 01:36:04.593
Why don't you tell me the rest of it?

930
01:36:10.516 --> 01:36:12.518
It's too awful.

931
01:36:14.270 --> 01:36:16.146
It's only a dream.

932
01:36:41.714 --> 01:36:43.757
He was kissing me...

933
01:36:50.222 --> 01:36:52.975
...and then we were making love.

934
01:36:58.063 --> 01:37:01.567
Then there were all these
other people around us...

935
01:37:01.734 --> 01:37:04.570
...hundreds of them, everywhere.

936
01:37:04.778 --> 01:37:07.323
Everyone was fucking.

937
01:37:13.162 --> 01:37:14.747
And then I....

938
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:20.294
I was fucking other men.

939
01:37:20.961 --> 01:37:22.671
So many...

940
01:37:24.298 --> 01:37:27.092
...I don't know how many I was with.

941
01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:35.142
And I knew you could see me
in the arms of all these men...

942
01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:40.939
...just fucking all these men.

943
01:37:45.361 --> 01:37:48.072
I wanted to make fun of you...

944
01:37:49.782 --> 01:37:52.201
...to laugh in your face.

945
01:37:55.537 --> 01:38:00.459
And so I laughed as loud as I could.

946
01:38:14.598 --> 01:38:17.768
That must have been
when you woke me up.

947
01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:03.480
Shit!

948
01:39:37.556 --> 01:39:40.100
- Hi.
- Hi.

949
01:39:40.517 --> 01:39:42.644
I'll just have a cup of coffee, please.

950
01:39:50.110 --> 01:39:51.361
Anything else?

951
01:39:52.654 --> 01:39:54.406
No, thank you.

952
01:40:01.163 --> 01:40:02.623
Excuse me.

953
01:40:03.624 --> 01:40:06.793
Do you know when they get in
next door at the Sonata Cafe?

954
01:40:07.002 --> 01:40:10.422
I think there's usually someone
in the office around 2 or 3.

955
01:40:14.927 --> 01:40:19.473
I don't suppose, by any chance,
you know Nick Nightingale?

956
01:40:19.681 --> 01:40:22.601
He's playing piano
over there right now.

957
01:40:22.935 --> 01:40:24.394
Nick Nightingale?

958
01:40:24.853 --> 01:40:27.439
Sure, he comes in here.

959
01:40:30.234 --> 01:40:33.028
Look, maybe you can help me...

960
01:40:33.237 --> 01:40:36.865
...because it's important that
I get in touch with him.

961
01:40:38.116 --> 01:40:39.785
Do you know where he's staying?

962
01:40:43.497 --> 01:40:46.625
I don't know if he'd want me
to give out his address.

963
01:40:46.792 --> 01:40:49.127
It's okay, I'm a doctor.

964
01:40:49.461 --> 01:40:51.922
I'm actually a very old friend of his.

965
01:40:53.507 --> 01:40:55.008
Well, doctor...

966
01:40:57.469 --> 01:41:01.139
...he'll be playing there tonight.
Can't it wait until then?

967
01:41:02.849 --> 01:41:06.061
Listen, to be perfectly honest...

968
01:41:08.355 --> 01:41:10.107
...it's a medical matter.

969
01:41:10.524 --> 01:41:14.820
Some tests. I know he'll wanna
know about them as soon as possible.

970
01:41:42.014 --> 01:41:43.015
Excuse me.

971
01:41:44.683 --> 01:41:46.935
Hi! How can I help you?

972
01:41:47.185 --> 01:41:50.897
Can you please ring Mr. Nightingale's
room for me? Nick Nightingale.

973
01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:55.027
I'm sorry, sir, Mr. Nightingale
has already checked out.

974
01:41:55.277 --> 01:41:58.155
- He checked out?
- Yes.

975
01:42:00.907 --> 01:42:04.828
- Did he leave a forwarding address?
- No, I'm afraid not.

976
01:42:06.204 --> 01:42:07.998
When did he check out?

977
01:42:09.458 --> 01:42:11.460
About 5:00 this morning.

978
01:42:11.668 --> 01:42:13.920
- 5:00?
- Yes.

979
01:42:14.713 --> 01:42:16.715
That's an early checkout, isn't it?

980
01:42:16.882 --> 01:42:19.676
It is a little on the early side, yeah.

981
01:42:20.761 --> 01:42:22.387
Look...

982
01:42:23.764 --> 01:42:26.642
...did you notice anything...

983
01:42:27.017 --> 01:42:28.435
...I don't know...

984
01:42:29.144 --> 01:42:32.189
...unusual about him when he left?

985
01:42:34.191 --> 01:42:35.567
Unusual?

986
01:42:37.235 --> 01:42:40.197
- Hey, you're not Five-O, are you?
- No.

987
01:42:40.739 --> 01:42:42.115
No, I'm an old friend of his.

988
01:42:42.324 --> 01:42:43.408
Really?

989
01:42:43.867 --> 01:42:45.369
I'm a doctor.

990
01:42:48.747 --> 01:42:53.085
- Well, Bill...?
- Sure.

991
01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:58.340
It's funny you should
ask that question, Bill...

992
01:42:58.548 --> 01:43:01.927
...because actually there was
something a little strange...

993
01:43:02.094 --> 01:43:04.638
...about the way Mr. Nightingale left.

994
01:43:04.971 --> 01:43:07.349
Really? What was that?

995
01:43:15.524 --> 01:43:20.112
He came in this morning,
about 4:30 a.m...

996
01:43:20.612 --> 01:43:22.531
...with two men.

997
01:43:23.615 --> 01:43:25.283
Big guys.

998
01:43:25.784 --> 01:43:28.787
They were very well-dressed
and very well-spoken.

999
01:43:28.995 --> 01:43:32.666
But they weren't the kind of people
you'd fool around with...

1000
01:43:32.874 --> 01:43:34.668
...if you know what I mean.

1001
01:43:37.462 --> 01:43:38.964
Anyways...

1002
01:43:40.257 --> 01:43:45.011
...I noticed Mr. Nightingale
had a bruise on his cheek.

1003
01:43:45.804 --> 01:43:50.642
To be perfectly honest, I also
thought he looked a little scared.

1004
01:43:51.643 --> 01:43:52.853
Scared?

1005
01:43:53.019 --> 01:43:54.354
Yes. Yes.

1006
01:43:55.605 --> 01:43:57.232
He said he wanted to check out.

1007
01:43:57.441 --> 01:44:01.319
And then he went upstairs to his room
with one of the men.

1008
01:44:01.653 --> 01:44:05.532
The other guy stayed down in the lobby
and settled his bill.

1009
01:44:06.241 --> 01:44:10.454
When they came back, Mr. Nightingale
tried to pass me an envelope.

1010
01:44:10.662 --> 01:44:12.372
But they saw it and took it...

1011
01:44:12.581 --> 01:44:15.500
...and said that any mail
or messages for him...

1012
01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:20.297
...would be collected by someone
properly authorized to do so.

1013
01:44:21.131 --> 01:44:23.633
And then they just
took him off in a car.

1014
01:44:24.926 --> 01:44:27.220
Do you have any idea where they went?

1015
01:44:27.679 --> 01:44:29.556
No, not a clue.

1016
01:44:34.561 --> 01:44:39.107
Well, anyway....

1017
01:44:41.693 --> 01:44:43.862
I certainly appreciate your help.

1018
01:44:44.029 --> 01:44:47.282
Anytime, Bill. Bye.

1019
01:45:21.775 --> 01:45:26.071
- Oh, the good doctor!
- Mr. Milich.

1020
01:45:26.238 --> 01:45:31.201
- Was your outfit a success?
- Yes, it was. Thank you.

1021
01:45:31.701 --> 01:45:33.078
Good, good.

1022
01:45:33.245 --> 01:45:38.208
Tuxedo. Cloak. Shoes.

1023
01:45:40.836 --> 01:45:44.589
I think you forgot the mask.

1024
01:45:45.882 --> 01:45:48.176
- It's not there?
- No, no, no.

1025
01:45:48.343 --> 01:45:50.846
Maybe you left it at the party?

1026
01:45:55.934 --> 01:45:57.519
I don't think so.

1027
01:45:59.479 --> 01:46:02.983
I must have lost it.
Could you put it on the bill, please?

1028
01:46:03.191 --> 01:46:04.192
Sure.

1029
01:46:08.530 --> 01:46:10.448
Here we are.

1030
01:46:11.950 --> 01:46:16.037
That was 150 for the rental,
200 you said for my trouble...

1031
01:46:16.246 --> 01:46:19.666
...25 for the mask. Sorry....

1032
01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:24.129
Three hundred seventy-five.

1033
01:46:26.798 --> 01:46:28.008
Yes, dear?

1034
01:46:28.383 --> 01:46:29.843
Come, come.

1035
01:46:31.136 --> 01:46:34.055
Would you like to say hello
to Dr. Harford?

1036
01:46:35.265 --> 01:46:38.226
- Hello.
- Hello.

1037
01:46:43.356 --> 01:46:46.985
Thank you, Mr. Milich.
I'll call you soon. Bye-bye.

1038
01:46:47.152 --> 01:46:48.987
Goodbye, gentlemen.

1039
01:46:49.321 --> 01:46:52.574
- Merry Christmas and happy New Year!
- And you too.

1040
01:46:53.491 --> 01:46:55.785
Well, Dr. Harford...

1041
01:46:57.037 --> 01:46:58.622
...here is your receipt.

1042
01:46:59.956 --> 01:47:02.208
I'm tearing up your deposits...

1043
01:47:03.376 --> 01:47:05.712
...and thanks for the business.

1044
01:47:10.258 --> 01:47:13.595
Mr. Milich, last night...

1045
01:47:16.348 --> 01:47:18.850
...you were going to call the police.

1046
01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:24.439
Well, things change.
We have come to another arrangement.

1047
01:47:24.648 --> 01:47:29.569
And by the way, if the good doctor
should ever want anything again...

1048
01:47:30.236 --> 01:47:31.988
...anything at all...

1049
01:47:32.948 --> 01:47:35.533
...it needn't be a costume.

1050
01:48:02.978 --> 01:48:04.229
Come in.

1051
01:48:05.981 --> 01:48:08.733
- Tuna salad and black coffee.
- Thanks.

1052
01:48:09.776 --> 01:48:12.862
Listen, how's my afternoon looking?

1053
01:48:13.071 --> 01:48:17.993
I think it's just Mrs. Akerly at 2:30
and Mrs. Kominski at 4.

1054
01:48:18.368 --> 01:48:22.580
Well, something's come up, and I'm
not gonna be able to see them.

1055
01:48:22.789 --> 01:48:26.501
Please ask Dr. Miller if he can fit
them in. Otherwise, just apologize...

1056
01:48:26.710 --> 01:48:28.628
- ...and make new appointments.
- Sure.

1057
01:48:29.045 --> 01:48:33.133
And please call the garage and have
them get my car out in half an hour.

1058
01:48:33.341 --> 01:48:35.510
- No problem.
- Okay?

1059
01:52:16.773 --> 01:52:19.901
- Hi.
- Hi, Daddy.

1060
01:52:20.652 --> 01:52:22.570
Hi.

1061
01:52:24.489 --> 01:52:27.158
Any calls for me?

1062
01:52:27.367 --> 01:52:31.329
Dr. Sanders and Mrs. Shapiro.

1063
01:52:32.622 --> 01:52:34.374
- Hey, gang.
- Hi, Daddy.

1064
01:52:34.540 --> 01:52:35.792
Hey.

1065
01:52:35.959 --> 01:52:37.919
Look, I got all these right.

1066
01:52:38.127 --> 01:52:40.463
- You got all of those right?
- Yeah.

1067
01:52:40.630 --> 01:52:42.382
Every single one of them?

1068
01:52:42.799 --> 01:52:44.133
That's good.

1069
01:52:44.342 --> 01:52:45.843
You hungry?

1070
01:52:47.011 --> 01:52:48.346
Sort of.

1071
01:52:48.513 --> 01:52:50.348
Wanna eat at 7?

1072
01:52:50.515 --> 01:52:52.850
Seven? Listen, can we
make that earlier?

1073
01:52:53.017 --> 01:52:57.021
I have some appointments
at the office.

1074
01:52:57.188 --> 01:52:59.274
You have to go out again tonight?

1075
01:52:59.482 --> 01:53:00.483
I'm afraid so.

1076
01:53:00.692 --> 01:53:04.195
Daddy, am I gonna get
a puppy for Christmas?

1077
01:53:04.821 --> 01:53:07.282
We'll see about that, okay?

1078
01:53:09.826 --> 01:53:11.995
He could be a watchdog....

1079
01:53:12.203 --> 01:53:13.621
We'll see.

1080
01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:16.624
Come on, baby, let's finish this off.

1081
01:53:16.833 --> 01:53:20.461
All right, we have Joe.
And Joe has $2.50.

1082
01:53:20.670 --> 01:53:25.258
And Mike has $1.75.

1083
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:29.178
Joe has how much more money than Mike?

1084
01:53:29.387 --> 01:53:31.723
$0.75?

1085
01:53:33.599 --> 01:53:37.061
So is it gonna be
a subtraction or an addition?

1086
01:53:40.732 --> 01:53:44.068
"How much more" means that
it would be a subtraction.

1087
01:53:44.235 --> 01:53:47.238
Yeah, because you're gonna be taking....
Right.

1088
01:53:47.572 --> 01:53:50.867
<i>And there were all these
other people around us.</i>

1089
01:53:51.242 --> 01:53:53.703
<i>Hundreds of them, everywhere.</i>

1090
01:53:54.245 --> 01:53:56.414
<i>Everyone was fucking.</i>

1091
01:53:57.415 --> 01:54:00.877
<i>And then I....
I was fucking other men.</i>

1092
01:54:02.253 --> 01:54:03.880
<i>So many...</i>

1093
01:54:04.422 --> 01:54:07.300
<i>...I don't know how many I was with.</i>

1094
01:55:12.824 --> 01:55:13.825
Hello.

1095
01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:17.286
<i>Hello?</i>

1096
01:55:19.497 --> 01:55:21.165
Hello?

1097
01:55:44.814 --> 01:55:47.567
Keep the change. Merry Christmas.

1098
01:56:18.097 --> 01:56:20.516
- What is it?
- Domino?

1099
01:56:20.892 --> 01:56:22.727
No, she's not in.

1100
01:56:26.731 --> 01:56:28.941
Are you expecting her back soon?

1101
01:56:29.150 --> 01:56:30.651
No, I'm not.

1102
01:56:34.530 --> 01:56:36.115
Okay.

1103
01:56:37.241 --> 01:56:40.745
I have something for her.
Can I leave this with you?

1104
01:56:41.579 --> 01:56:42.914
Just a minute.

1105
01:56:49.921 --> 01:56:51.756
Can I say who it's from?

1106
01:56:53.257 --> 01:56:55.593
Well, just tell her it's from...

1107
01:56:56.636 --> 01:56:57.637
...Bill.

1108
01:56:58.179 --> 01:57:00.890
- You're Bill?
- Yes.

1109
01:57:01.057 --> 01:57:05.102
The Bill? You're the doctor
who was here last night?

1110
01:57:06.103 --> 01:57:08.564
Well, I suppose I am.

1111
01:57:08.940 --> 01:57:11.192
Domino said how nice you were to her.

1112
01:57:12.485 --> 01:57:13.611
Did she?

1113
01:57:16.447 --> 01:57:18.449
Why don't you come in for a second?

1114
01:57:21.494 --> 01:57:22.537
Sure.

1115
01:57:43.307 --> 01:57:44.809
I'm Sally.

1116
01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:47.436
Hello, Sally.

1117
01:57:50.481 --> 01:57:55.444
So do you have any idea
when you expect Domino back?

1118
01:57:56.821 --> 01:57:58.322
No.

1119
01:57:59.031 --> 01:58:00.992
I have no idea.

1120
01:58:01.909 --> 01:58:05.204
- You have no idea?
- No.

1121
01:58:09.417 --> 01:58:14.338
To be perfectly honest,
she may not even be coming back.

1122
01:58:16.632 --> 01:58:19.427
She may not even be coming back?

1123
01:58:33.524 --> 01:58:35.067
Well....

1124
01:58:40.156 --> 01:58:41.365
I....

1125
01:58:44.785 --> 01:58:45.911
You...?

1126
01:58:46.203 --> 01:58:50.541
I think there's something
that I should tell you.

1127
01:58:50.958 --> 01:58:53.502
- Really?
- Yeah.

1128
01:58:53.919 --> 01:58:56.714
But I just don't know.
I don't know.

1129
01:58:56.881 --> 01:59:00.176
You don't know?
Well, what is it?

1130
01:59:04.221 --> 01:59:06.557
I don't know whether to tell you this.

1131
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:15.066
Why don't you have a seat?

1132
01:59:15.775 --> 01:59:17.526
Let's sit down.

1133
01:59:33.668 --> 01:59:38.047
- I don't quite know how to say this.
- You don't quite know how?

1134
01:59:42.426 --> 01:59:46.222
Well, considering that you
were with Domino last night...

1135
01:59:48.766 --> 01:59:53.187
...I think it would be only fair to you
to let you know...

1136
01:59:56.273 --> 01:59:59.610
...that she got the results
of a blood test this morning...

1137
01:59:59.777 --> 02:00:03.072
...and it was HIV-positive.

1138
02:00:14.083 --> 02:00:17.002
- HIV-positive?
- Yeah.

1139
02:00:31.392 --> 02:00:36.272
I am very, very sorry to hear that.

1140
02:00:40.818 --> 02:00:42.194
Yeah.

1141
02:00:43.487 --> 02:00:46.449
I mean, it's absolutely devastating.

1142
02:00:59.503 --> 02:01:02.214
Listen, can I offer you anything?

1143
02:01:02.715 --> 02:01:04.675
A cup of coffee maybe?

1144
02:01:13.267 --> 02:01:14.727
No, thank you.

1145
02:01:19.523 --> 02:01:21.025
I think...

1146
02:01:22.401 --> 02:01:24.361
...maybe I'd better be going.

1147
02:01:28.783 --> 02:01:30.951
Okay.

1148
02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:14.847
- Taxi!
- Off duty.

1149
02:05:04.665 --> 02:05:07.710
I'll just have a cappuccino, please.

1150
02:05:07.918 --> 02:05:09.753
I'll bring it over to you.

1151
02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:11.046
Thank you.

1152
02:06:51.105 --> 02:06:52.481
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1153
02:06:52.689 --> 02:06:54.108
I'm Dr. Harford.

1154
02:06:54.316 --> 02:06:58.695
One of my patients was admitted
this morning. Miss Amanda Curran.

1155
02:06:58.904 --> 02:07:01.031
Could you please
give me her room number?

1156
02:07:01.198 --> 02:07:05.035
Certainly, doctor.
Her name again?

1157
02:07:05.369 --> 02:07:07.913
Curran. Amanda Curran.

1158
02:07:08.122 --> 02:07:10.332
C-U-R-R-A-N?

1159
02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:13.127
Yes.

1160
02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:16.755
Miss Amanda Curran?

1161
02:07:17.548 --> 02:07:18.882
That's right.

1162
02:07:19.550 --> 02:07:23.053
I'm sorry, doctor.
Miss Curran died this afternoon.

1163
02:07:27.099 --> 02:07:28.976
She died this afternoon?

1164
02:07:29.351 --> 02:07:32.688
Yes, at 3:45 p.m.

1165
02:07:33.147 --> 02:07:34.606
I'm sorry.

1166
02:08:22.779 --> 02:08:25.449
<i>Because it could cost me my life...</i>

1167
02:08:26.366 --> 02:08:28.410
<i>...and possibly yours.</i>

1168
02:10:12.014 --> 02:10:13.557
Hello.

1169
02:10:14.266 --> 02:10:16.059
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

1170
02:10:18.228 --> 02:10:19.521
Tonight?

1171
02:10:20.230 --> 02:10:22.357
No, no, no, that's okay.

1172
02:10:26.403 --> 02:10:30.115
Please tell him I'll be there
in about 20 minutes. Okay?

1173
02:10:53.055 --> 02:10:54.348
Come in.

1174
02:10:56.433 --> 02:11:00.145
Bill, I appreciate you coming.
Sorry to drag you out here.

1175
02:11:00.395 --> 02:11:03.148
- Let me have your coat.
- I was out anyway. Thank you.

1176
02:11:03.357 --> 02:11:04.733
How about a drink?

1177
02:11:05.317 --> 02:11:06.693
- Are you having one?
- Sure.

1178
02:11:06.860 --> 02:11:09.029
- Okay.
- What would you like?

1179
02:11:09.529 --> 02:11:10.781
Just a little scotch.

1180
02:11:10.989 --> 02:11:12.115
Good.

1181
02:11:14.034 --> 02:11:15.285
How do you take it? Neat?

1182
02:11:15.452 --> 02:11:16.578
Please.

1183
02:11:18.288 --> 02:11:20.499
That was a terrific party
the other night.

1184
02:11:20.707 --> 02:11:24.961
- Alice and I had a wonderful time.
- Well, good. Good.

1185
02:11:25.462 --> 02:11:27.255
It was great seeing you both.

1186
02:11:27.464 --> 02:11:29.466
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1187
02:11:29.633 --> 02:11:31.009
Were you playing?

1188
02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:34.805
No, I was just
knocking a few balls around.

1189
02:11:36.056 --> 02:11:38.809
- Beautiful scotch.
- That's a 25-year-old.

1190
02:11:38.975 --> 02:11:41.478
- I'll send you over a case.
- No, please.

1191
02:11:41.686 --> 02:11:44.064
- Why not?
- No.

1192
02:11:46.149 --> 02:11:48.318
You feel like playing?

1193
02:11:48.485 --> 02:11:51.822
No, thanks.
You go ahead, I'll watch.

1194
02:11:54.408 --> 02:11:55.867
I was just....

1195
02:11:58.662 --> 02:11:59.746
Listen...

1196
02:12:01.498 --> 02:12:02.999
...Bill....

1197
02:12:06.336 --> 02:12:11.299
The reason I asked you
to come over is...

1198
02:12:13.260 --> 02:12:15.637
...I need to talk to you
about something.

1199
02:12:16.513 --> 02:12:17.764
Sure.

1200
02:12:20.976 --> 02:12:22.644
It's a little bit awkward.

1201
02:12:25.313 --> 02:12:28.191
And I have to be completely frank.

1202
02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:32.404
What kind of problem are you having?

1203
02:12:37.075 --> 02:12:39.202
It isn't a medical problem.

1204
02:12:44.833 --> 02:12:46.251
Actually...

1205
02:12:48.170 --> 02:12:50.088
...it concerns you.

1206
02:12:58.805 --> 02:13:00.265
Bill....

1207
02:13:03.143 --> 02:13:06.229
I know what happened last night.

1208
02:13:10.192 --> 02:13:13.778
And I know what's been
going on since then.

1209
02:13:18.450 --> 02:13:21.828
And I think you just might...

1210
02:13:23.205 --> 02:13:26.666
...have the wrong idea
about one or two things.

1211
02:13:39.971 --> 02:13:42.432
I'm sorry, Victor, I....

1212
02:13:44.434 --> 02:13:47.646
What in the hell
are you talking about?

1213
02:13:49.773 --> 02:13:52.442
Please, Bill, no games.

1214
02:13:54.611 --> 02:13:56.112
I was there.

1215
02:13:58.031 --> 02:13:59.616
At the house.

1216
02:14:03.119 --> 02:14:06.248
I saw everything that went on.

1217
02:14:15.006 --> 02:14:16.508
Bill....

1218
02:14:18.134 --> 02:14:22.097
What the hell did you think
you were doing?

1219
02:14:25.725 --> 02:14:29.062
I couldn't even begin to imagine...

1220
02:14:30.272 --> 02:14:31.982
...how you'd even heard about it...

1221
02:14:32.148 --> 02:14:35.819
...let alone got yourself
through the door.

1222
02:14:39.656 --> 02:14:44.578
Then I remembered seeing you
with that prick piano player...

1223
02:14:44.828 --> 02:14:48.039
...Nick whatever the fuck his name was,
at my party.

1224
02:14:48.999 --> 02:14:51.960
And it didn't take much to
figure out the rest.

1225
02:14:56.464 --> 02:14:58.258
It wasn't Nick's fault.

1226
02:15:00.093 --> 02:15:01.678
It was mine.

1227
02:15:02.012 --> 02:15:04.097
Of course it was Nick's fault.

1228
02:15:04.431 --> 02:15:08.018
If he hadn't mentioned it to you,
none of this would've happened.

1229
02:15:08.184 --> 02:15:10.895
I recommended that cocksucker
to those people...

1230
02:15:11.104 --> 02:15:14.065
...and he's made me look like
a complete asshole.

1231
02:15:18.862 --> 02:15:20.322
Victor....

1232
02:15:21.740 --> 02:15:23.658
What can I say?

1233
02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:31.374
I had...

1234
02:15:32.876 --> 02:15:34.419
...absolutely...

1235
02:15:35.378 --> 02:15:39.966
...no idea you were involved
in any way.

1236
02:15:41.426 --> 02:15:43.553
I know you didn't, Bill.

1237
02:15:45.388 --> 02:15:47.474
But I also know that you....

1238
02:15:48.433 --> 02:15:51.061
You went to Nick's hotel
this morning...

1239
02:15:51.269 --> 02:15:53.063
...and talked to the desk clerk.

1240
02:15:54.606 --> 02:15:56.274
How do you know that?

1241
02:15:58.276 --> 02:16:00.320
Because I had you followed.

1242
02:16:06.242 --> 02:16:07.911
You had me followed?

1243
02:16:10.330 --> 02:16:12.666
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

1244
02:16:13.041 --> 02:16:14.959
All right? I owe you an apology.

1245
02:16:15.168 --> 02:16:17.921
This was for your own good, believe me.

1246
02:16:18.296 --> 02:16:22.300
I know what the desk clerk told you.
But what he didn't tell you is...

1247
02:16:22.509 --> 02:16:25.720
...all they did was
put Nick on a plane to Seattle.

1248
02:16:26.096 --> 02:16:29.474
By now he's probably back
with his family...

1249
02:16:29.641 --> 02:16:32.394
...you know, banging Mrs. Nick.

1250
02:16:33.770 --> 02:16:36.981
The clerk said
he had a bruise on his face.

1251
02:16:39.067 --> 02:16:42.278
Okay, he had a bruise on his face.

1252
02:16:43.321 --> 02:16:46.282
That's a hell of a lot less
than he deserves.

1253
02:16:47.117 --> 02:16:51.246
Listen, Bill, I don't think you realize what
kind of trouble you were in last night.

1254
02:16:52.664 --> 02:16:54.791
Who do you think those people were?

1255
02:16:55.417 --> 02:16:57.627
Those were not just
ordinary people there.

1256
02:16:57.794 --> 02:17:01.131
If I told you their names--
I'm not gonna tell you their names...

1257
02:17:01.297 --> 02:17:05.135
...but if I did,
I don't think you'd sleep so well.

1258
02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:10.849
Was it the second password?

1259
02:17:12.225 --> 02:17:13.935
Is that what gave me away?

1260
02:17:16.062 --> 02:17:18.356
Yes, finally.

1261
02:17:20.483 --> 02:17:22.819
But not because you didn't know it.

1262
02:17:24.696 --> 02:17:27.615
It's because there was
no second password.

1263
02:17:28.783 --> 02:17:33.329
Of course it didn't help a whole lot
that those people arrive in limos...

1264
02:17:33.538 --> 02:17:36.040
...and you showed up in a taxi.

1265
02:17:36.332 --> 02:17:40.003
Or that they found the receipt from
the rental house in your coat...

1266
02:17:40.211 --> 02:17:43.339
...made out to you-know-who.

1267
02:17:52.807 --> 02:17:54.642
There was a....

1268
02:17:58.438 --> 02:18:00.273
There was a....

1269
02:18:01.065 --> 02:18:04.527
There was a woman there...

1270
02:18:10.366 --> 02:18:12.076
...who tried to warn me.

1271
02:18:17.791 --> 02:18:19.042
I know.

1272
02:18:24.756 --> 02:18:26.549
Do you know who she was?

1273
02:18:31.930 --> 02:18:33.431
Yes.

1274
02:18:40.563 --> 02:18:42.232
She was a hooker.

1275
02:18:51.783 --> 02:18:53.493
Sorry, but...

1276
02:18:54.661 --> 02:18:56.663
...that's what she was.

1277
02:19:01.042 --> 02:19:02.210
A hooker.

1278
02:19:10.760 --> 02:19:13.513
Bill...

1279
02:19:17.100 --> 02:19:19.602
...suppose I told you...

1280
02:19:21.229 --> 02:19:24.107
...that everything that
happened to you there...

1281
02:19:25.650 --> 02:19:29.779
...the threats, the girl's warnings...

1282
02:19:29.988 --> 02:19:32.782
...her last-minute intervention...

1283
02:19:32.949 --> 02:19:36.703
...suppose I said that all of that...

1284
02:19:38.121 --> 02:19:40.790
...was staged.

1285
02:19:42.876 --> 02:19:46.796
That it was a kind of charade.

1286
02:19:48.381 --> 02:19:50.300
That it was fake.

1287
02:19:54.971 --> 02:19:56.306
Fake?

1288
02:19:58.057 --> 02:20:00.602
Yes. Fake.

1289
02:20:12.113 --> 02:20:14.032
Why would they do that?

1290
02:20:14.908 --> 02:20:16.117
Why?

1291
02:20:17.410 --> 02:20:19.162
In plain words...

1292
02:20:20.038 --> 02:20:22.582
...to scare the living shit out of you.

1293
02:20:23.750 --> 02:20:27.170
To keep you quiet
about where you'd been...

1294
02:20:27.670 --> 02:20:29.380
...and what you'd seen.

1295
02:20:49.442 --> 02:20:51.069
Have you seen this?

1296
02:21:08.378 --> 02:21:10.380
Yes, I have.

1297
02:21:15.885 --> 02:21:18.972
I saw her body in the morgue.

1298
02:21:27.814 --> 02:21:31.025
Was she the woman at the party?

1299
02:21:38.908 --> 02:21:40.451
Yes.

1300
02:21:43.329 --> 02:21:44.747
She was.

1301
02:21:55.591 --> 02:21:57.468
Victor...

1302
02:21:59.095 --> 02:22:01.597
...the woman lying dead in the morgue...

1303
02:22:03.599 --> 02:22:05.518
...was the woman at the party?

1304
02:22:07.937 --> 02:22:09.564
Yes.

1305
02:22:14.152 --> 02:22:19.115
Well, Victor, maybe I'm
missing something here.

1306
02:22:19.949 --> 02:22:23.411
You called it a fake, a charade.

1307
02:22:25.079 --> 02:22:28.458
Do you mind telling me
what kind of fucking charade...

1308
02:22:28.666 --> 02:22:32.545
...ends with somebody turning up dead?

1309
02:22:38.426 --> 02:22:43.139
Okay, Bill, let's cut the bullshit.
All right?

1310
02:22:43.306 --> 02:22:46.142
You've been way out of your depth
for the last 24 hours.

1311
02:22:46.309 --> 02:22:49.812
You wanna know what kind of charade?
I'll tell you exactly what kind.

1312
02:22:51.064 --> 02:22:54.692
That whole play-acted,
"take me" phony sacrifice...

1313
02:22:54.901 --> 02:22:59.530
...that you've been jerking off with
had nothing to do with her real death.

1314
02:22:59.739 --> 02:23:03.367
Nothing happened after you left
that hadn't happened to her before.

1315
02:23:03.576 --> 02:23:06.662
She got her brains fucked out. Period.

1316
02:23:08.039 --> 02:23:12.418
When they took her home,
she was just fine...

1317
02:23:13.086 --> 02:23:14.837
...and the rest is in the paper.

1318
02:23:15.004 --> 02:23:18.674
She was a junkie. She OD'd.
There was nothing suspicious.

1319
02:23:18.883 --> 02:23:23.096
Her door was locked from the inside.
The police are happy. End of story.

1320
02:23:24.514 --> 02:23:29.477
Come on. It was always gonna be
just a matter of time with her.

1321
02:23:29.811 --> 02:23:31.521
Remember, you told her so yourself.

1322
02:23:31.687 --> 02:23:35.525
You remember, the one with the
great tits who OD'd in my bathroom?

1323
02:23:52.416 --> 02:23:56.587
Listen, Bill, nobody killed anybody.

1324
02:23:57.046 --> 02:23:59.674
Someone died. It happens all the time.

1325
02:24:01.134 --> 02:24:03.427
But life goes on.

1326
02:24:03.886 --> 02:24:05.304
It always does...

1327
02:24:05.513 --> 02:24:07.014
...until it doesn't.

1328
02:24:08.599 --> 02:24:10.560
But you know that, don't you?

1329
02:27:35.139 --> 02:27:37.683
I'll tell you everything.

1330
02:27:43.105 --> 02:27:45.399
I'll tell you everything.

1331
02:28:37.243 --> 02:28:39.453
Helena's gonna be up soon.

1332
02:28:56.345 --> 02:29:00.599
She's expecting us to
take her Christmas shopping today.

1333
02:29:25.416 --> 02:29:26.542
That's nice.

1334
02:29:26.709 --> 02:29:29.378
I could put Sabrina in here.

1335
02:29:30.045 --> 02:29:32.548
It's really pretty.

1336
02:29:32.715 --> 02:29:34.717
It's old-fashioned.

1337
02:29:43.893 --> 02:29:45.102
He's big.

1338
02:29:45.311 --> 02:29:48.731
I hope Santa Claus gets me
one of these for Christmas.

1339
02:29:48.898 --> 02:29:50.191
You do?

1340
02:29:52.568 --> 02:29:54.695
Well, you're gonna
have to wait and see.

1341
02:30:00.743 --> 02:30:02.411
Alice.

1342
02:30:08.834 --> 02:30:10.878
What do you think we should do?

1343
02:30:16.050 --> 02:30:17.593
What do I think we should do?

1344
02:30:17.760 --> 02:30:19.094
Look, Mommy!

1345
02:30:21.722 --> 02:30:23.224
Hey.

1346
02:30:28.437 --> 02:30:31.106
What do I think?
I don't know.

1347
02:30:33.275 --> 02:30:35.069
I mean, maybe....

1348
02:30:35.945 --> 02:30:37.613
Hey.

1349
02:30:47.122 --> 02:30:50.626
Maybe I think...

1350
02:30:51.293 --> 02:30:53.587
...we should be grateful.

1351
02:30:59.635 --> 02:31:01.220
Grateful...

1352
02:31:01.804 --> 02:31:06.725
...that we've managed to
survive through all of our...

1353
02:31:07.643 --> 02:31:09.353
...adventures...

1354
02:31:11.814 --> 02:31:14.149
...whether they were real...

1355
02:31:14.650 --> 02:31:16.902
...or only a dream.

1356
02:31:26.161 --> 02:31:29.999
Are you sure of that?

1357
02:31:33.877 --> 02:31:35.546
Am I sure?

1358
02:31:51.353 --> 02:31:53.147
Only as sure as I am...

1359
02:31:53.355 --> 02:31:57.192
...that the reality of one night...

1360
02:31:58.485 --> 02:32:01.363
...let alone that of a whole lifetime...

1361
02:32:03.866 --> 02:32:06.243
...can ever be the whole truth.

1362
02:32:13.042 --> 02:32:15.044
And no dream is ever...

1363
02:32:16.879 --> 02:32:18.672
...just a dream.

1364
02:32:27.222 --> 02:32:29.224
The important thing is...

1365
02:32:31.143 --> 02:32:32.895
...we're awake now...

1366
02:32:34.229 --> 02:32:36.565
...and hopefully...

1367
02:32:39.526 --> 02:32:41.779
...for a long time to come.

1368
02:32:45.449 --> 02:32:46.909
Forever.

1369
02:32:49.119 --> 02:32:50.579
Forever?

1370
02:32:52.915 --> 02:32:54.375
Forever.

1371
02:32:56.794 --> 02:33:00.381
Let's not use that word. You know?

1372
02:33:01.715 --> 02:33:03.676
It frightens me.

1373
02:33:13.936 --> 02:33:17.064
But I do love you...

1374
02:33:20.192 --> 02:33:21.902
...and you know...

1375
02:33:23.112 --> 02:33:25.239
...there is something very important...

1376
02:33:25.447 --> 02:33:28.158
...that we need
to do as soon as possible.

1377
02:33:29.493 --> 02:33:30.786
What's that?

1378
02:33:33.956 --> 02:33:35.457
Fuck.
