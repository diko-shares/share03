1
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.531
Dismount!

2
00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:06.869
Herman's horse-sick!

3
00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:16.378
Chaps, no one wander off.

4
00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:20.341
Some of the passageways
in here can run for miles.

5
00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.316
I don't think this is such a good idea.

6
00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.189
What is it?

7
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:07.770
Then keep digging.

8
00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.810
The kid's got something!

9
00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:13.516
I got something, garth!
I got something...

10
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.350
I got something right here.

11
00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:23.400
Look at that!

12
00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:26.324
- We're rich! We're rich!
- Shut up. Shut up.

13
00:03:26.415 --> 00:03:28.497
Well, we're rich, ain't we?

14
00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:31.833
Indy...

15
00:03:32.838 --> 00:03:33.953
Indy?

16
00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:36.538
What are they doing?

17
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.086
Indiana? Indiana?

18
00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.306
Hey, we got to find
more stuff to bring back.

19
00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:48.429
It's the cross of coronado.

20
00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.470
Cortez gave it to him in 1520.

21
00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:52.805
Oh, boy!

22
00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:57.818
I'm thinkin" about raisin' my dead mama,
dig down and put it on her bony finger!

23
00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:01.989
That cross is an important artifact.
It belongs in a museum.

24
00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:04.441
Run back and find the others.

25
00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:06.990
Tell Mr. havelock
that there are men looting in the caves.

26
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.243
Have him bring the sheriff.
It's only a snake.

27
00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:11.823
Did you hear what I said?

28
00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.408
Right. Run back...

29
00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:15.664
Mr. havelock... the sheriff...

30
00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:17.747
What, what are you gonna do?

31
00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:19.297
I don't know.

32
00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:20.920
I'll think of something.

33
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.886
Dig with your hands,
not with your mouth.

34
00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:45.399
He's got our thing!

35
00:04:45.494 --> 00:04:47.200
- Get him!
- Get off me!

36
00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:54.874
Mr. havelock! Anybody!

37
00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:57.248
Everybody's lost but me.

38
00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:59.876
There he is! Let's go! Let's go!

39
00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:18.564
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Dang it!

40
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.230
Hey! Come back here!

41
00:05:38.964 --> 00:05:40.579
Come on! Get him!

42
00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.551
Hey, come back here!

43
00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:58.498
Here, let me.

44
00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:38.120
Holy smokes!

45
00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:03.354
Come on, kid.

46
00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:07.817
There's no way out of this.

47
00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:20.913
Hey!

48
00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:42.014
Toss up the whip.

49
00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:54.610
You got heart, kid,
but that belongs to me.

50
00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.111
It belongs to coronado.

51
00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.534
Coronado is dead,
and so are all of his grandchildren.

52
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:01.033
This should be in a museum.

53
00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:02.785
Now give it back!

54
00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:07.793
A snake! Snakel

55
00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:10.129
don't let him get away!

56
00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:12.468
Magic?

57
00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:15.592
Hold it.

58
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.466
Make sure he doesn't double back.

59
00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:36.656
Okay, kid, out of the box, now.

60
00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:39.359
Son of a...

61
00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:52.167
Damn.

62
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.680
Dad!

63
00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:07.930
Dad!

64
00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:10.727
Dad.

65
00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:13.313
- Dad...
- Out.

66
00:10:13.404 --> 00:10:15.861
- It's important.
- Then wait. Count to 20.

67
00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:18.444
- No, dad. You listen to me.
- Junior!

68
00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:19.866
One, two, three, four...

69
00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:21.738
In Greek.

70
00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:38.965
"May he who illuminated this,
illuminate me."

71
00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:46.926
I brought the sheriff.

72
00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:50.139
Just the man I want to see.

73
00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:51.460
Now, there were five or six of them...

74
00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:53.045
- It's all right, son.
- They came after me...

75
00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:55.435
- You still got it?
- Well, yes, sir.

76
00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:56.736
It's right here.

77
00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.105
I'm glad to see that

78
00:11:00.243 --> 00:11:04.577
because the rightful owner of this cross
won't press charges if you give it back.

79
00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:08.831
He's got witnesses, five or six of them.

80
00:11:19.971 --> 00:11:21.086
Yeah!

81
00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:33.727
Good day.

82
00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:40.234
You lost today, kid,

83
00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:44.193
but it doesn't mean you have to like it.

84
00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:12.728
Small world, Dr. Jones.

85
00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:14.897
Too small for two of us.

86
00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:25.574
This is the second time
I've had to reclaim

87
00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:26.947
my property from you.

88
00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:29.154
That belongs in a museum.

89
00:12:30.124 --> 00:12:31.614
So do you.

90
00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:34.208
Throw him over the side.

91
00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:24.042
Grab him, he's getting away! Stop him!

92
00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:22.354
Archeology is the search for fact...

93
00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:26.567
Not truth.

94
00:14:26.657 --> 00:14:28.052
If it's truth you're interested in,

95
00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:31.113
Dr. Tyree's philosophy class
is right down the hall.

96
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.447
So forget any ideas you've got about
lost cities, exotic travel,

97
00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:36.951
and digging up the world.

98
00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:38.874
We do not follow maps
to buried treasure,

99
00:14:38.961 --> 00:14:41.998
and "x" never, ever, marks the spot.

100
00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:49.131
Seventy percent of all archeology
is done in the library.

101
00:14:49.347 --> 00:14:51.008
Research. Reading.

102
00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:56.642
We cannot afford to take mythology
at face value.

103
00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:00.138
Next week, egyptology,

104
00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:04.067
starting with the excavation of naukratis
by flinders petrie in 1885.

105
00:15:04.153 --> 00:15:06.860
I will be in my office
if anybody's got any problems,

106
00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:09.155
for the next hour and a half.

107
00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:16.700
Marcus, I did it.

108
00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:18.656
You've got it!

109
00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:31.423
You know how long I've
been looking for that?

110
00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:33.004
All your life.

111
00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:34.384
All my life.

112
00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:37.182
Well done, indy. Very well done, indeed.

113
00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:41.346
This will find a place of honor
in our Spanish collection.

114
00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:45.354
We can discuss my honorarium
over dinner and champagne tonight.

115
00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:47.484
Your treat. Yes.

116
00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:50.024
My treat.

117
00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:55.193
- Dr. Jones!
- Dr. Jones!

118
00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:03.959
Dr. Jones, I am so glad you're back.

119
00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:05.941
Your mail is on your desk.
Here are your phone messages.

120
00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:07.005
Dr. Jones, you promised...

121
00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:08.193
This is your appointment schedule,

122
00:16:08.217 --> 00:16:10.549
and these term papers
still haven't been graded.

123
00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:12.964
Okay. Irene, put everybody's name
on a list,

124
00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:14.215
get the order they arrived...

125
00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:16.096
- Oh, come on, Dr. Jones.
- Dr. Jones.

126
00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:20.348
And I'll see each and
every one of them in turn.

127
00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:33.989
"Venice, Italy."

128
00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:36.033
Dr. Jones!

129
00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:04.679
Dr. Jones?

130
00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:11.986
Dr. Jones.

131
00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:31.255
I trust your trip down
was comfortable, Dr. Jones.

132
00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:34.508
My men didn't alarm you, I hope.

133
00:17:35.137 --> 00:17:37.674
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.

134
00:17:37.765 --> 00:17:39.471
I know who you are, Mr. Donovan.

135
00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.119
Your contributions to the museum
over the years

136
00:17:41.143 --> 00:17:42.599
have been extremely generous.

137
00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:44.957
Some of the pieces in your collection
here are very impressive.

138
00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:48.974
Well, like yourself, Dr. Jones,
I have a passion for antiquities.

139
00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:51.149
Have a look over here.

140
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.486
This might interest you.

141
00:17:57.827 --> 00:18:00.990
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol.

142
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:03.404
Early Latin text.

143
00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:05.739
Mid-12th century, I should think.

144
00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:07.666
That was our assessment, as well.

145
00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:08.833
Where did this come from?

146
00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:11.879
My engineers unearthed it
in the mountain region north of Ankara

147
00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:14.173
while excavating for copper.

148
00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.751
Can you translate the inscription?

149
00:18:19.807 --> 00:18:23.550
"Who drinks the water
I shall give him, says the lord,

150
00:18:23.644 --> 00:18:26.602
"will have a spring inside him

151
00:18:26.689 --> 00:18:29.556
"welling up for eternal life.

152
00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:33.316
"Let them bring me
to your holy mountain

153
00:18:33.404 --> 00:18:35.520
"in the place where you dwell.

154
00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:38.527
"Across the desert
and through the mountain

155
00:18:39.493 --> 00:18:42.030
"to the canyon of the Crescent moon,

156
00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:45.571
"to the temple where the cup that...

157
00:18:48.836 --> 00:18:53.079
"Where the cup that holds the blood
of Jesus Christ resides forever."

158
00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:57.250
The holy grail, Dr. Jones.

159
00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:01.804
The chalice used by Christ
during the last supper.

160
00:19:02.725 --> 00:19:05.637
The cup that caught his blood
at the crucifixion

161
00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:08.640
and was entrusted to
Joseph of arimathea.

162
00:19:09.857 --> 00:19:11.472
The Arthur legend.

163
00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:13.979
I've heard this bedtime story before.

164
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.856
Eternal life, Dr. Jones!

165
00:19:15.946 --> 00:19:18.688
The gift of youth
to whoever drinks from the grail.

166
00:19:18.783 --> 00:19:21.149
Now, that's a bedtime story
I'd like to wake up to.

167
00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:22.483
An old man's dream.

168
00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:26.036
Every man's dream,
including your father's, I believe.

169
00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:32.163
Grail lore is his hobby.

170
00:19:32.254 --> 00:19:33.835
He's a teacher of medieval literature.

171
00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:35.754
The one the students hope
they don't get.

172
00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:39.212
Walter, you're neglecting your guests.

173
00:19:39.303 --> 00:19:41.419
Be along in a moment, dear.

174
00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:48.725
Hard to resist, isn't it?

175
00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:52.397
The holy grail's final resting place
described in detail.

176
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.311
What good is it?

177
00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:58.190
This grail tablet speaks of deserts
and mountains and canyons.

178
00:19:58.447 --> 00:19:59.687
It's pretty vague.

179
00:19:59.782 --> 00:20:01.397
Where do you want to start looking?

180
00:20:01.492 --> 00:20:03.887
Maybe if the tablet were intact,
you'd have something to go on,

181
00:20:03.911 --> 00:20:05.526
but the entire top portion is missing.

182
00:20:05.621 --> 00:20:08.954
Just the same, an attempt to recover
the grail is currently underway.

183
00:20:11.752 --> 00:20:14.915
Let me tell you another
bedtime story, Dr. Jones.

184
00:20:15.297 --> 00:20:18.039
After the grail was entrusted
to Joseph of arimathea,

185
00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:21.001
it disappeared,
and was lost for a thousand years

186
00:20:21.095 --> 00:20:24.838
before it was found again
by three knights of the first crusade.

187
00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:26.388
Three brothers, to be exact.

188
00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:28.466
I've heard this one, as well.

189
00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:30.597
Two of these brothers
walked out of the desert

190
00:20:30.688 --> 00:20:33.725
160 years after having found the grail

191
00:20:33.816 --> 00:20:35.852
and began the long journey
back to France,

192
00:20:35.943 --> 00:20:37.979
but only one of them made it.

193
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:41.437
And before dying of extreme old age,

194
00:20:41.532 --> 00:20:46.151
he supposedly imparted his tale to a...
To a franciscan friar, I think.

195
00:20:46.704 --> 00:20:48.990
Not "supposedly," Dr. Jones.

196
00:20:49.707 --> 00:20:54.121
This is the manuscript in which
the friar chronicled the knight's story.

197
00:20:54.754 --> 00:20:57.166
It doesn't reveal the location of
the grail, I'm afraid,

198
00:20:57.339 --> 00:20:59.045
but the knight promised
that two markers

199
00:20:59.133 --> 00:21:00.669
that had been left behind would.

200
00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:04.384
This tablet is one of those markers.

201
00:21:04.472 --> 00:21:06.679
It proves the knight's story is true.

202
00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:09.348
But as you pointed out, it's incomplete.

203
00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:12.393
Now, the second marker is entombed
with the knight's dead brother.

204
00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.562
Our project leader
believes that tomb to be located

205
00:21:15.649 --> 00:21:18.311
within the city of venice, Italy.

206
00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:22.778
As you can now see, Dr. Jones,

207
00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:25.861
we're about to complete a great quest

208
00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:28.988
that began almost 2,000 years ago.

209
00:21:29.705 --> 00:21:31.445
We're only one step away.

210
00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.703
That's usually when the ground falls out
from underneath your feet.

211
00:21:35.544 --> 00:21:37.409
You could be more right than you know.

212
00:21:37.713 --> 00:21:38.793
Yes?

213
00:21:39.048 --> 00:21:40.709
We've hit a snag.

214
00:21:41.675 --> 00:21:45.759
Our project leader has vanished,
along with all his research.

215
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.342
We received a cable from his colleague,
Dr. Schneider,

216
00:21:49.433 --> 00:21:53.142
who has no idea of his whereabouts
or what's become of him.

217
00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:56.895
I want you to pick up the trail
where he left off.

218
00:21:57.274 --> 00:22:00.061
Find the man,
and you will find the grail.

219
00:22:01.612 --> 00:22:04.399
You've got the wrong Jones,
Mr. Donovan.

220
00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:08.198
Why don't you try my father?

221
00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:10.071
We already have.

222
00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:13.120
Your father is the man
who has disappeared.

223
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.001
Your father and I have been friends
since time began.

224
00:22:27.096 --> 00:22:28.336
I've watched you grow up, indy.

225
00:22:28.389 --> 00:22:30.095
I've watched the two of you grow apart.

226
00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:32.222
I've never seen you this concerned
about him before.

227
00:22:32.268 --> 00:22:33.383
Dad?

228
00:22:33.477 --> 00:22:35.593
He's an academic, a bookworm.
He's not a field man.

229
00:22:35.688 --> 00:22:36.768
Dad?

230
00:22:37.398 --> 00:22:38.433
Dad?

231
00:22:38.941 --> 00:22:40.181
Dear god.

232
00:22:43.028 --> 00:22:46.316
What has the old fool
got himself into now?

233
00:22:47.408 --> 00:22:50.400
I don't know, but whatever it is,
he's in over his head.

234
00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.155
Dad?

235
00:22:52.746 --> 00:22:55.488
It's today's mail, and it's been opened.

236
00:22:58.085 --> 00:22:59.165
Mail.

237
00:22:59.795 --> 00:23:01.456
That's it, Marcus.

238
00:23:03.924 --> 00:23:05.414
Venice, Italy.

239
00:23:08.762 --> 00:23:10.127
What is it?

240
00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:20.312
Every clue he followed.
Every discovery he made.

241
00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:22.890
A complete record of his search
for the holy grail.

242
00:23:24.653 --> 00:23:26.564
This is his whole life.

243
00:23:27.114 --> 00:23:29.651
Why would he have sent this to me?

244
00:23:29.742 --> 00:23:31.152
I don't know,

245
00:23:31.243 --> 00:23:33.859
but someone must want it pretty badly.

246
00:23:44.006 --> 00:23:45.917
Do you believe, Marcus?

247
00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.807
Do you believe the grail actually exists?

248
00:24:02.191 --> 00:24:06.776
The search for the cup of Christ
is the search for the divine in all of us.

249
00:24:07.154 --> 00:24:09.861
But if you want facts, indy,
I've none to give you.

250
00:24:11.033 --> 00:24:14.446
At my age, I'm prepared to
take a few things on faith.

251
00:24:20.376 --> 00:24:21.536
Call Donovan, Marcus.

252
00:24:21.627 --> 00:24:24.539
Tell him I'll take that ticket
to venice now.

253
00:24:26.215 --> 00:24:28.206
I'll tell him we'll take two.

254
00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:35.967
All right, tell me what's going to happen
when we get to venice.

255
00:24:36.058 --> 00:24:38.078
Don't worry, Dr. Schneider
will be there to meet you.

256
00:24:38.102 --> 00:24:39.579
- Schneider?
- I maintain an apartment in venice.

257
00:24:39.603 --> 00:24:40.638
It's at your disposal.

258
00:24:40.729 --> 00:24:42.640
Oh, well, that's good. Thank you.

259
00:24:44.775 --> 00:24:47.061
Dr. Jones, good luck.

260
00:24:47.903 --> 00:24:50.895
Now be very careful.
Don't trust anybody.

261
00:25:25.065 --> 00:25:27.021
Signora? Signorina?

262
00:25:34.616 --> 00:25:37.449
Ah, venice... yes.

263
00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:41.616
How will we recognize
this Dr. Schneider when we see him?

264
00:25:42.124 --> 00:25:44.740
I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.

265
00:25:44.835 --> 00:25:46.166
Dr. Jones?

266
00:25:47.838 --> 00:25:48.953
Yes?

267
00:25:49.631 --> 00:25:51.292
I knew it was you.

268
00:25:51.967 --> 00:25:54.128
You have your father's eyes.

269
00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:59.422
And my mother's ears,
but the rest belongs to you.

270
00:26:00.142 --> 00:26:02.679
Looks like the best parts
have already been spoken for.

271
00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:05.678
- Marcus Brody?
- That's right.

272
00:26:06.315 --> 00:26:07.521
Dr. Elsa Schneider.

273
00:26:07.608 --> 00:26:08.768
How do you do?

274
00:26:09.693 --> 00:26:12.651
The last time I saw your father,
we were in the library.

275
00:26:12.738 --> 00:26:15.229
He was very close to tracking down
the knight's tomb.

276
00:26:15.324 --> 00:26:17.189
I've never seen him so excited.

277
00:26:17.284 --> 00:26:19.616
He was as giddy as a schoolboy.

278
00:26:19.703 --> 00:26:21.694
Who? Attila the professor?

279
00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:24.952
He was never giddy,
even when he was a schoolboy.

280
00:26:25.709 --> 00:26:27.665
Fraulein, will you permit me?

281
00:26:27.878 --> 00:26:29.743
- I usually don't.
- I usually don't, either.

282
00:26:29.838 --> 00:26:32.250
- In that case, I permit you.
- It would make me very happy.

283
00:26:32.341 --> 00:26:34.673
But I'm already sad.
By tomorrow, it will have faded.

284
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:35.820
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.

285
00:26:35.844 --> 00:26:38.176
I hate to interrupt you,
but the reason we're here...

286
00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:40.219
Yes. I have something to show you.

287
00:26:40.307 --> 00:26:42.093
I left your father working in the library.

288
00:26:42.184 --> 00:26:45.267
He sent me to the map section
to fetch an ancient plan of the city.

289
00:26:45.354 --> 00:26:48.187
When I got back to his table,
he'd gone, with all his papers,

290
00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:50.764
except for that scrap,
which I found near his chair.

291
00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:51.859
Roman numerals.

292
00:26:52.486 --> 00:26:54.226
Here is the library.

293
00:26:54.613 --> 00:26:57.229
That doesn't look much like a library.

294
00:26:57.491 --> 00:26:59.447
Looks like a converted church.

295
00:26:59.535 --> 00:27:01.617
In this case, it's the literal truth.

296
00:27:01.703 --> 00:27:03.443
We are on holy ground.

297
00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:07.157
These columns over here
were brought back as spoils of war

298
00:27:07.251 --> 00:27:10.539
after the sacking of Byzantium
during the crusades.

299
00:27:11.964 --> 00:27:13.500
Now, please excuse me.

300
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:15.296
The library's closing in a few moments.

301
00:27:15.384 --> 00:27:18.342
I'll arrange for us to
stay a little longer.

302
00:27:20.973 --> 00:27:24.557
Marcus, I've seen this window before.

303
00:27:24.643 --> 00:27:25.643
Where?

304
00:27:25.727 --> 00:27:27.888
Right here, in dad's diary.

305
00:27:36.446 --> 00:27:37.652
You see?

306
00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:40.526
Look, indy. The Roman numerals.

307
00:27:41.285 --> 00:27:43.276
Dad was onto something here.

308
00:27:43.579 --> 00:27:45.265
Well, now we know
the source of the numbers,

309
00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:47.245
but we still don't know what they mean.

310
00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:48.822
Dad sent me this diary for a reason.

311
00:27:48.917 --> 00:27:51.624
Until we find out why,
I suggest we keep it to ourselves.

312
00:27:51.712 --> 00:27:52.918
Find something?

313
00:27:53.005 --> 00:27:54.996
Yes. Three, seven and ten.

314
00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.581
That window seems to be
the source of the Roman numerals.

315
00:27:57.676 --> 00:27:59.257
My god, I must be blind.

316
00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:02.507
Dad wasn't looking for a book
about the knight's tomb,

317
00:28:02.598 --> 00:28:04.554
he was looking for the tomb itself.

318
00:28:04.641 --> 00:28:05.972
Don't you get it?

319
00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:08.015
The tomb is somewhere in the library.

320
00:28:08.103 --> 00:28:10.014
You said yourself it used to be a church.

321
00:28:10.105 --> 00:28:11.220
Look.

322
00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:12.683
Three.

323
00:28:15.027 --> 00:28:16.187
Three.

324
00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:17.734
Seven.

325
00:28:17.821 --> 00:28:19.357
Seven. Ten.

326
00:28:21.074 --> 00:28:22.280
And ten.

327
00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:24.149
Now where's the ten?

328
00:28:25.829 --> 00:28:27.785
Look around for the ten.

329
00:28:36.965 --> 00:28:38.580
Three and seven.

330
00:28:38.842 --> 00:28:40.753
Seven and seven

331
00:28:41.637 --> 00:28:42.797
and ten.

332
00:29:03.492 --> 00:29:04.492
Ten.

333
00:29:06.745 --> 00:29:08.326
"X" marks the spot.

334
00:30:05.887 --> 00:30:07.047
Bingo.

335
00:30:07.139 --> 00:30:08.720
You don't disappoint, Dr. Jones.

336
00:30:08.807 --> 00:30:10.343
You're a great deal like your father.

337
00:30:10.434 --> 00:30:11.970
Except he's lost, and I'm not.

338
00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.550
Lower me down.

339
00:30:23.613 --> 00:30:26.025
Look after this for me, will you?

340
00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.086
Come on.

341
00:30:48.805 --> 00:30:51.592
Pagan symbols. Fourth or fifth century.

342
00:30:51.767 --> 00:30:52.767
Right.

343
00:30:52.934 --> 00:30:55.300
600 years before the crusades.

344
00:30:55.937 --> 00:30:57.893
The christians would have
dug their own passages

345
00:30:57.981 --> 00:31:00.188
and burial chambers centuries later.

346
00:31:00.275 --> 00:31:01.275
That's right.

347
00:31:01.318 --> 00:31:03.855
If there's a knight of
the first crusade down here,

348
00:31:03.945 --> 00:31:05.435
that's where we'll find him.

349
00:31:37.687 --> 00:31:39.393
What's this one?

350
00:31:39.481 --> 00:31:40.937
The ark of the covenant.

351
00:31:41.024 --> 00:31:43.106
- Are you sure?
- Pretty sure.

352
00:32:00.836 --> 00:32:02.167
Watch out.

353
00:32:18.854 --> 00:32:21.687
I should sink a well down here
and retire.

354
00:32:38.874 --> 00:32:40.034
Give me the lighter.

355
00:32:50.594 --> 00:32:51.879
Oh, rats.

356
00:33:08.361 --> 00:33:09.567
Come on.

357
00:33:58.453 --> 00:33:59.863
Come here.

358
00:34:07.963 --> 00:34:10.921
Look, it... it must be one of these.

359
00:34:11.299 --> 00:34:15.133
Look at the artistry of these carvings,
and the scrollwork.

360
00:34:31.528 --> 00:34:33.109
It's this one.

361
00:34:48.461 --> 00:34:51.248
This is it. We found it.

362
00:34:54.884 --> 00:34:55.999
Look.

363
00:34:56.845 --> 00:35:01.009
The engraving on the shield,
it's the same as on the grail tablet.

364
00:35:03.018 --> 00:35:05.350
The shield is the second marker.

365
00:35:05.687 --> 00:35:07.143
What's that?

366
00:35:07.272 --> 00:35:10.264
It's a rubbing dad made
of the grail tablet.

367
00:35:12.193 --> 00:35:15.276
Just like your father,
giddy as a schoolboy.

368
00:35:16.698 --> 00:35:18.939
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if he were here now to see this?

369
00:35:21.036 --> 00:35:23.197
He never would have
made it past the rats.

370
00:35:23.288 --> 00:35:24.528
He hates rats.

371
00:35:24.623 --> 00:35:26.363
He's scared to death of them.

372
00:35:47.979 --> 00:35:50.311
Get back! Back against the wall.

373
00:35:55.111 --> 00:35:57.147
Quick! Under it! Air pocket!

374
00:36:03.328 --> 00:36:05.284
Don't wander off. “What?

375
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:06.786
What?

376
00:36:25.809 --> 00:36:27.845
I think I've found a way out.

377
00:36:27.936 --> 00:36:29.301
Deep breath.

378
00:36:46.287 --> 00:36:48.573
Ah, venice.

379
00:37:54.647 --> 00:37:56.683
Are you crazy? Don't go between them!

380
00:37:56.983 --> 00:37:59.190
Go between them? Are you crazy?

381
00:38:10.497 --> 00:38:12.203
I said go around!

382
00:38:12.457 --> 00:38:14.322
You said go between them!

383
00:38:14.417 --> 00:38:17.033
I said, don't go between them!

384
00:39:19.315 --> 00:39:20.430
No!

385
00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.441
Why are you trying to kill us?

386
00:39:27.532 --> 00:39:29.397
Because you're looking
for the holy grail.

387
00:39:29.909 --> 00:39:33.117
My father was looking for the holy grail.
Did you kill him too?

388
00:39:33.204 --> 00:39:34.204
No.

389
00:39:34.289 --> 00:39:36.120
Where is he?

390
00:39:36.583 --> 00:39:38.244
Talk or you're dead.

391
00:39:38.334 --> 00:39:39.949
Damn it, tell me!

392
00:39:40.545 --> 00:39:41.785
Tell me!

393
00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.417
If you don't let go, Dr. Jones,
we'll both die.

394
00:39:44.507 --> 00:39:45.997
Then we'll die.

395
00:39:46.175 --> 00:39:48.917
My soul is prepared. How's yours?

396
00:39:50.805 --> 00:39:52.215
This is your last chance.

397
00:39:52.348 --> 00:39:54.555
No, Dr. Jones, it's yours.

398
00:40:11.159 --> 00:40:13.616
All right, where's my father?

399
00:40:13.703 --> 00:40:16.536
If you let me go,
I will tell you where he is.

400
00:40:17.206 --> 00:40:18.491
Who are you?

401
00:40:18.958 --> 00:40:20.494
My name is kazim.

402
00:40:20.585 --> 00:40:22.075
And why were you trying to kill me?

403
00:40:22.837 --> 00:40:26.830
The secret of the grail has been safe
for a thousand years,

404
00:40:27.175 --> 00:40:28.915
and for all that time,

405
00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:30.966
the brotherhood of the cruciform sword

406
00:40:31.054 --> 00:40:34.262
have been prepared
to do anything to keep it safe.

407
00:40:36.851 --> 00:40:38.842
Let me off at this jetty.

408
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:46.354
Ask yourself, why do you
seek the cup of Christ?

409
00:40:47.195 --> 00:40:49.811
Is it for his glory, or for yours?

410
00:40:51.074 --> 00:40:54.532
I didn't come for the cup of Christ.
I came to find my father.

411
00:40:55.995 --> 00:40:58.782
In that case,
god be with you in your quest.

412
00:40:58.873 --> 00:41:01.034
Your father is being held
in the castle of brunwald,

413
00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:03.366
on the Austrian-German border.

414
00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.505
How's the head?

415
00:41:13.596 --> 00:41:16.008
It's better, now I've seen this.

416
00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:20.178
It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta"?

417
00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.220
The knights of the first crusade

418
00:41:25.274 --> 00:41:28.562
laid siege to the city
of alexandretta for over a year.

419
00:41:28.653 --> 00:41:30.894
The entire city was destroyed.

420
00:41:33.825 --> 00:41:37.238
The present city of iskenderun
is built on its ruins.

421
00:41:38.579 --> 00:41:41.571
Marcus, you remember
what the grail tablet said,

422
00:41:41.666 --> 00:41:43.346
"across the desert
and through the mountain

423
00:41:43.418 --> 00:41:46.000
"to the canyon of the Crescent moon."

424
00:41:48.798 --> 00:41:50.663
But where exactly?

425
00:41:50.758 --> 00:41:52.623
Your father would know.

426
00:41:54.595 --> 00:41:57.553
Your father did know.
Look. He made a map.

427
00:41:58.266 --> 00:42:00.285
He must have pieced it together
from clues scattered through

428
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:02.470
the whole history of the grail quest.

429
00:42:02.562 --> 00:42:03.562
A map with no names.

430
00:42:03.646 --> 00:42:07.434
Now, he knew there was a city
with an oasis due east, here.

431
00:42:07.525 --> 00:42:10.358
He knew the course turned south
through the desert to a river,

432
00:42:10.445 --> 00:42:12.276
and the river led
into the mountains, here.

433
00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:13.648
Straight to the canyon.

434
00:42:13.781 --> 00:42:16.238
He knew everything
except where to begin,

435
00:42:16.325 --> 00:42:18.111
the name of the city.

436
00:42:19.954 --> 00:42:21.364
Alexandretta.

437
00:42:21.956 --> 00:42:24.038
Now we know. Yes. Now we know.

438
00:42:24.125 --> 00:42:26.707
Marcus, get hold of sallah.
Tell him to meet you in iskenderun.

439
00:42:26.794 --> 00:42:28.284
What about you?

440
00:42:28.379 --> 00:42:29.414
I'm going after dad.

441
00:42:51.444 --> 00:42:52.524
Elsa?

442
00:42:58.576 --> 00:43:00.157
Elsa? Elsa?

443
00:43:11.839 --> 00:43:13.955
- My room...
- Mine, too.

444
00:43:14.842 --> 00:43:16.332
What were they looking for?

445
00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:17.507
This.

446
00:43:17.929 --> 00:43:19.510
The grail diary?

447
00:43:21.182 --> 00:43:22.513
You had it?

448
00:43:23.518 --> 00:43:25.133
You didn't trust me.

449
00:43:25.228 --> 00:43:26.889
I didn't know you.

450
00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:29.478
At least I let you tag along.

451
00:43:29.732 --> 00:43:30.767
Oh, yes.

452
00:43:30.858 --> 00:43:33.770
Give them a flower,
and they'll follow you anywhere.

453
00:43:35.404 --> 00:43:37.611
Knock it off. You're not mad.

454
00:43:38.074 --> 00:43:39.189
No?

455
00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:41.899
No. You like the way I do things.

456
00:43:41.994 --> 00:43:43.950
It's lucky I don't do things the same way.

457
00:43:44.038 --> 00:43:46.825
You'd still be standing
at the venice pier!

458
00:43:47.125 --> 00:43:50.117
Look, what do you think
is going on here?

459
00:43:50.211 --> 00:43:52.668
Since I met you,
I've nearly been incinerated,

460
00:43:52.755 --> 00:43:55.212
drowned, shot at,
and chopped into fish bait.

461
00:43:55.299 --> 00:43:56.860
We're caught in the middle
of something sinister here.

462
00:43:56.884 --> 00:43:59.842
My guess is dad found out
more than he was looking for.

463
00:43:59.929 --> 00:44:03.217
And until I'm sure,
I'm going to continue to do things

464
00:44:03.307 --> 00:44:05.889
the way I think they should be done.

465
00:44:08.896 --> 00:44:10.887
How dare you kiss me!

466
00:44:17.071 --> 00:44:20.313
Leave me alone. I don't like fast women.

467
00:44:21.576 --> 00:44:24.488
And I hate arrogant men.

468
00:44:34.964 --> 00:44:36.500
Ah, venice.

469
00:45:08.831 --> 00:45:10.492
What do you know about this place?

470
00:45:10.583 --> 00:45:13.666
I know the brunwalds
are famous art collectors.

471
00:45:16.214 --> 00:45:17.750
What are you going to do?

472
00:45:17.924 --> 00:45:20.290
Don't know. I'll think of something.

473
00:45:28.017 --> 00:45:29.017
Yes?

474
00:45:29.101 --> 00:45:30.887
And not before time!

475
00:45:30.978 --> 00:45:33.435
Did you intend to leave us
standing on the doorstep all day?

476
00:45:33.522 --> 00:45:35.058
We're drenched!

477
00:45:36.067 --> 00:45:38.900
Now look, I've gone and caught a sniffle.

478
00:45:38.986 --> 00:45:40.226
Are you expected?

479
00:45:40.321 --> 00:45:43.063
Do not take that tone with me,
my good man.

480
00:45:43.157 --> 00:45:44.988
Now buttle off and tell baron brunwald

481
00:45:45.117 --> 00:45:48.655
that lord Clarence MacDonald
and his lovely assistant

482
00:45:48.746 --> 00:45:51.078
are here to view the tapestries.

483
00:45:51.165 --> 00:45:52.325
Tapestries?

484
00:45:52.416 --> 00:45:53.906
Dear me, the man is dense.

485
00:45:54.001 --> 00:45:57.289
This is a castle, isn't it?
There are tapestries?

486
00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.711
This is a castle,

487
00:45:59.799 --> 00:46:02.336
and we have many tapestries.

488
00:46:02.885 --> 00:46:06.628
But if you are a Scottish lord,
then I am Mickey mouse!

489
00:46:08.099 --> 00:46:09.509
How dare he?

490
00:46:36.585 --> 00:46:39.122
Nazis. I hate these guys.

491
00:46:52.601 --> 00:46:54.216
This one. I think he's in here.

492
00:46:54.312 --> 00:46:55.973
How do you know?

493
00:46:56.063 --> 00:46:57.803
Because it's wired.

494
00:47:25.926 --> 00:47:28.087
Indy? Indy?

495
00:47:28.596 --> 00:47:30.587
Don't worry. This is kid's play.

496
00:47:30.681 --> 00:47:32.467
I'll be right back.

497
00:47:57.124 --> 00:47:58.284
Junior?

498
00:47:59.585 --> 00:48:00.665
Yes, sir.

499
00:48:01.045 --> 00:48:02.706
It is you, junior!

500
00:48:03.339 --> 00:48:05.204
Don't call me that, please.

501
00:48:05.299 --> 00:48:06.630
Well, what are you doing here?

502
00:48:06.884 --> 00:48:09.500
I came to get you. What do you thi...

503
00:48:18.979 --> 00:48:21.311
Late 14th century, ming dynasty.

504
00:48:22.525 --> 00:48:23.935
It breaks the heart.

505
00:48:24.026 --> 00:48:26.358
And the head. You hit me, dad.

506
00:48:26.445 --> 00:48:28.481
I'll never forgive myself.

507
00:48:29.031 --> 00:48:30.896
Don't worry, I'm fine.

508
00:48:32.827 --> 00:48:34.158
Thank god.

509
00:48:37.289 --> 00:48:38.620
It's fake.

510
00:48:40.334 --> 00:48:43.041
See, you can tell by the cross section.

511
00:48:44.505 --> 00:48:45.995
No!

512
00:48:46.132 --> 00:48:48.623
Dad, get your stuff.
We've got to get out of here.

513
00:48:48.717 --> 00:48:52.801
Well, I'm sorry about your head, though,
but I thought you were one of them.

514
00:48:52.888 --> 00:48:55.504
Dad, they come in through the doors.

515
00:48:56.183 --> 00:48:57.423
Good point.

516
00:48:58.310 --> 00:48:59.846
But better safe than sorry.

517
00:49:00.187 --> 00:49:01.927
So I was wrong this time.

518
00:49:02.022 --> 00:49:05.480
But, by god, I wasn't wrong
when I mailed you my diary.

519
00:49:05.568 --> 00:49:06.683
You obviously got it.

520
00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:11.486
I got it, and I used it.

521
00:49:12.366 --> 00:49:14.652
We found the entrance
to the catacombs.

522
00:49:14.743 --> 00:49:16.233
Through the library?

523
00:49:16.912 --> 00:49:18.072
Right.

524
00:49:21.542 --> 00:49:22.873
I knew it.

525
00:49:23.294 --> 00:49:24.875
And the tomb of sir Richard?

526
00:49:26.547 --> 00:49:27.787
Found it.

527
00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.165
He was actually there?

528
00:49:33.721 --> 00:49:35.336
You saw him?

529
00:49:35.431 --> 00:49:37.547
Well, what was left of him.

530
00:49:37.975 --> 00:49:39.590
And his shield,

531
00:49:40.478 --> 00:49:43.390
the inscription on sir Richard's shield?

532
00:49:44.482 --> 00:49:45.767
"Alexandretta."

533
00:49:45.858 --> 00:49:48.725
Alexandrettal of course!

534
00:49:49.737 --> 00:49:52.900
On the pilgrim frail
from the eastern empire.

535
00:49:55.951 --> 00:49:57.657
Junior, you did it.

536
00:49:58.287 --> 00:49:59.902
No, dad. You did.

537
00:50:00.247 --> 00:50:01.657
Forty years.

538
00:50:02.958 --> 00:50:05.290
If only I could have been with you.

539
00:50:05.377 --> 00:50:07.163
There were rats, dad.

540
00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:08.960
Rats?

541
00:50:09.048 --> 00:50:10.458
Yeah, big ones.

542
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:12.164
What do the Nazis want with you, dad?

543
00:50:12.259 --> 00:50:14.750
They wanted my diary. Yeah?

544
00:50:15.012 --> 00:50:19.381
I knew I had to get that book
as far away from me as I possibly could.

545
00:50:22.353 --> 00:50:23.388
Yeah.

546
00:50:28.234 --> 00:50:29.565
Dr. Jones.

547
00:50:29.693 --> 00:50:30.773
Yes?

548
00:50:33.989 --> 00:50:35.775
I will take the book now.

549
00:50:38.035 --> 00:50:39.241
What book?

550
00:50:39.537 --> 00:50:41.744
You have the diary in your pocket.

551
00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:44.530
You dolt!

552
00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:47.332
Do you think my son
would be that stupid

553
00:50:47.419 --> 00:50:50.786
that he would bring my diary
all the way back here?

554
00:50:52.341 --> 00:50:53.831
You didn't, did you?

555
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:57.217
You didn't bring it, did you?
Well...

556
00:50:57.638 --> 00:50:59.174
You did.

557
00:50:59.557 --> 00:51:01.218
Look, can we discuss this later?

558
00:51:01.308 --> 00:51:03.344
I should have mailed it
to the Marx brothers.

559
00:51:03.435 --> 00:51:04.971
Will you take it easy?

560
00:51:05.062 --> 00:51:06.472
Take it easy?

561
00:51:06.564 --> 00:51:08.564
Why do you think I sent it home
in the first place?

562
00:51:08.649 --> 00:51:10.230
So it wouldn't fall into their hands!

563
00:51:10.401 --> 00:51:12.312
I came here to save you!

564
00:51:12.403 --> 00:51:13.403
Oh, yeah?

565
00:51:13.487 --> 00:51:15.899
And who's gonna come
to save you, junior?

566
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:17.196
I told you...

567
00:51:24.707 --> 00:51:26.663
Don't call me junior!

568
00:51:29.336 --> 00:51:30.997
Look what you did!

569
00:51:32.673 --> 00:51:34.959
I can't believe what you did...

570
00:51:37.386 --> 00:51:39.047
Elsa? Elsa?

571
00:51:39.138 --> 00:51:41.299
That's far enough.
Put down the gun, Dr. Jones.

572
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:43.426
Put down the gun, or the fraulein dies.

573
00:51:43.559 --> 00:51:45.800
- But she's one of them.
- Indy, please!

574
00:51:45.978 --> 00:51:47.764
She's a Nazi. “What?

575
00:51:47.855 --> 00:51:49.095
- Trust me.
- Indy, no!

576
00:51:49.189 --> 00:51:50.189
I will kill her!

577
00:51:50.357 --> 00:51:52.973
- Yeah? Go ahead!
- No! Don't shoot!

578
00:51:53.777 --> 00:51:55.187
Don't worry. He won't.

579
00:51:55.988 --> 00:51:57.774
Indy, please! Do what he says!

580
00:51:57.865 --> 00:51:59.776
And don't listen to her.

581
00:51:59.867 --> 00:52:01.607
Enough! She dies!

582
00:52:01.785 --> 00:52:03.241
Wait! Wait...

583
00:52:10.878 --> 00:52:12.209
I'm sorry.

584
00:52:12.671 --> 00:52:15.037
No, don't be.

585
00:52:28.646 --> 00:52:31.638
But you should have
listened to your father.

586
00:52:49.583 --> 00:52:52.666
She ransacked her own room,
and I fell for it.

587
00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:57.212
How did you know she was a Nazi?

588
00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:00.882
How did you know she was a Nazi?

589
00:53:01.095 --> 00:53:03.006
She talks in her sleep.

590
00:53:13.107 --> 00:53:15.348
I didn't trust her. Why did you?

591
00:53:15.651 --> 00:53:18.233
Because he didn't take my advice.

592
00:53:24.993 --> 00:53:26.733
Donovan.

593
00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:30.617
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody,
Dr. Jones?

594
00:53:30.874 --> 00:53:33.206
I misjudged you, Walter.

595
00:53:33.293 --> 00:53:36.376
I knew you would sell your mother
for an etruscan vase,

596
00:53:36.463 --> 00:53:39.921
but I didn't know you would
sell your country and your soul

597
00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:41.961
to the slime of humanity.

598
00:53:43.887 --> 00:53:45.468
Dr. Schneider,

599
00:53:45.556 --> 00:53:48.138
there are pages torn out of this.

600
00:53:56.817 --> 00:54:00.981
This book contained a map,
a map with no names,

601
00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:03.187
precise directions from the unknown city

602
00:54:03.282 --> 00:54:05.193
to the secret
canyon of the Crescent moon.

603
00:54:05.284 --> 00:54:06.284
So it did.

604
00:54:06.368 --> 00:54:08.108
Where are these missing pages,
this map?

605
00:54:08.203 --> 00:54:09.568
We must have these pages back.

606
00:54:09.663 --> 00:54:10.903
You're wasting your breath.

607
00:54:10.998 --> 00:54:12.784
He won't tell us,

608
00:54:12.875 --> 00:54:14.706
and he doesn't have to.

609
00:54:15.377 --> 00:54:18.335
It's perfectly obvious
where the pages are.

610
00:54:19.089 --> 00:54:20.829
He's given them to Marcus Brody.

611
00:54:22.342 --> 00:54:24.424
You didn't drag poor Marcus along,
did you?

612
00:54:24.511 --> 00:54:25.921
He's not up to the challenge.

613
00:54:26.013 --> 00:54:27.469
He sticks out like a sore thumb.

614
00:54:27.556 --> 00:54:28.671
We'll find him.

615
00:54:28.766 --> 00:54:30.427
The hell you will.

616
00:54:30.517 --> 00:54:32.178
He's got a two-day head start on you,

617
00:54:32.269 --> 00:54:33.679
which 1s more than he needs.

618
00:54:34.188 --> 00:54:36.099
Brody's got friends
in every town and village

619
00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:37.270
from here to the Sudan.

620
00:54:37.357 --> 00:54:40.019
He speaks a dozen languages,
knows every local custom.

621
00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:41.941
He'll blend in, disappear.

622
00:54:42.029 --> 00:54:43.860
You'll never see him again.

623
00:54:43.947 --> 00:54:46.529
With any luck,
he's got the grail already.

624
00:54:47.701 --> 00:54:49.783
Does anyone here speak english?

625
00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:50.950
Or even ancient Greek?

626
00:54:51.038 --> 00:54:52.198
Water? No, thank you, sir.

627
00:54:52.289 --> 00:54:53.620
No. Fish make love in it.

628
00:54:54.541 --> 00:54:56.953
Goodness me. Thank you so much.
No, I don't like that.

629
00:54:57.044 --> 00:54:58.204
No, I really don't want...

630
00:54:58.295 --> 00:55:00.456
No, no, thank you very much.

631
00:55:00.547 --> 00:55:02.538
No, thank you, madam. I'm a vegetarian.

632
00:55:03.050 --> 00:55:05.757
Does anyone understand
a word I'm saying here?

633
00:55:05.844 --> 00:55:07.300
Mr. Brody!

634
00:55:07.387 --> 00:55:08.547
Sallah. What a relief.

635
00:55:08.639 --> 00:55:10.971
Marcus Brody, sir.

636
00:55:11.058 --> 00:55:12.764
- But where is indy?
- He's in Austria.

637
00:55:12.851 --> 00:55:14.307
A slight detour.

638
00:55:14.394 --> 00:55:15.429
You are on your own?

639
00:55:15.521 --> 00:55:18.228
Yes, but don't panic.
Everything's under control.

640
00:55:18.649 --> 00:55:20.560
Have you, have you
arranged our supplies?

641
00:55:20.651 --> 00:55:22.482
Yes, of course.
But where are we going?

642
00:55:22.569 --> 00:55:24.025
This map will show you.

643
00:55:24.112 --> 00:55:26.068
It was drawn by...

644
00:55:26.573 --> 00:55:27.983
Mr. Brody.

645
00:55:28.575 --> 00:55:29.906
Welcome to iskenderun.

646
00:55:30.077 --> 00:55:31.988
The director
of the museum of antiquities

647
00:55:32.079 --> 00:55:33.194
has sent a car for you.

648
00:55:33.288 --> 00:55:35.574
Well, your servant, sir.

649
00:55:35.833 --> 00:55:36.913
And I am his.

650
00:55:37.751 --> 00:55:38.957
Follow me, please.

651
00:55:39.419 --> 00:55:41.000
My reputation precedes me.

652
00:55:41.088 --> 00:55:43.249
There is no museum in iskenderun.

653
00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:44.705
Papers, please.

654
00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.166
Papers? Of course.

655
00:55:47.261 --> 00:55:48.717
- Run.
- Yes.

656
00:55:48.804 --> 00:55:50.544
Papers. Got it here.

657
00:55:50.639 --> 00:55:52.254
Just finished reading it myself.

658
00:55:52.349 --> 00:55:54.510
- Run.
- Yes.

659
00:55:54.601 --> 00:55:56.512
Egyptian mail, morning edition. Run.

660
00:55:56.603 --> 00:55:57.809
Did you say...

661
00:55:57.938 --> 00:55:59.348
Run!

662
00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:16.035
Okay, okay, quick, quick, quick!

663
00:56:16.123 --> 00:56:19.115
Find the back door! Find the back door!

664
00:56:32.389 --> 00:56:34.345
Intolerable.

665
00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:38.550
Dr. Schneider. Message from Berlin.

666
00:56:38.645 --> 00:56:40.431
You must return immediately.

667
00:56:40.522 --> 00:56:43.355
- A rally at the institute of Aryan culture.
- So?

668
00:56:43.442 --> 00:56:47.606
Your presence on the platform
is requested at the highest level.

669
00:56:47.696 --> 00:56:50.688
Thank you, herr oberst.
I will meet you at iskenderun.

670
00:56:50.782 --> 00:56:52.693
Take this diary
to the reichmuseum in Berlin.

671
00:56:52.784 --> 00:56:55.321
It will show them our progress,
ahead of schedule.

672
00:56:55.412 --> 00:56:57.824
Without the map,
I'm afraid it's no better than a souvenir.

673
00:56:57.915 --> 00:56:59.155
Let me kill them now.

674
00:56:59.249 --> 00:57:00.329
No.

675
00:57:00.417 --> 00:57:02.248
If we fail to recover
the pages from Brody,

676
00:57:02.336 --> 00:57:03.917
we'll need them alive.

677
00:57:04.004 --> 00:57:06.495
Always do what the doctor orders.

678
00:57:14.431 --> 00:57:15.841
Don't look at me like that.

679
00:57:16.725 --> 00:57:18.511
We both wanted the grail.

680
00:57:18.602 --> 00:57:20.513
I would have done anything to get it.

681
00:57:20.604 --> 00:57:22.595
You would have done the same.

682
00:57:22.689 --> 00:57:24.600
I'm sorry you think so.

683
00:57:35.869 --> 00:57:39.407
I can't forget how wonderful it was.

684
00:57:39.498 --> 00:57:40.533
Thank you.

685
00:57:40.624 --> 00:57:42.535
It was rather wonderful.

686
00:57:51.551 --> 00:57:53.542
Dr. Schneider.

687
00:57:55.263 --> 00:57:56.673
Your car is waiting.

688
00:58:04.856 --> 00:58:06.892
That's how Austrians say good-bye.

689
00:58:13.407 --> 00:58:17.320
And this is how we say good-bye
in Germany, Dr. Jones.

690
00:58:25.293 --> 00:58:27.500
I liked the Austrian way better.

691
00:58:27.587 --> 00:58:29.248
So did I.

692
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:30.984
Let's try and get these ropes loose.

693
00:58:31.008 --> 00:58:33.841
We've got to get to Marcus
before the Nazis do.

694
00:58:33.927 --> 00:58:37.636
You said he had two days' start.
That he would blend in. Disappear.

695
00:58:37.723 --> 00:58:39.179
Are you kidding? I made that up.

696
00:58:39.266 --> 00:58:42.474
You know Marcus.
He got lost once in his own museum.

697
00:58:44.855 --> 00:58:47.517
Can you try and reach
my left jacket pocket?

698
00:58:48.775 --> 00:58:49.981
What am I looking for?

699
00:58:50.068 --> 00:58:51.524
My lucky charm.

700
00:58:53.113 --> 00:58:54.603
Feels like a cigarette lighter.

701
00:58:56.116 --> 00:58:57.356
Try and burn through the ropes.

702
00:58:59.244 --> 00:59:00.450
Very good.

703
00:59:25.187 --> 00:59:26.393
I ought to tell you something.

704
00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:29.563
Don't get sentimental now, dad.
Save it till we get out of here.

705
00:59:29.649 --> 00:59:30.980
The floor's on fire.

706
00:59:31.193 --> 00:59:32.649
See? What?

707
00:59:33.487 --> 00:59:34.602
And the chair.

708
00:59:34.988 --> 00:59:37.070
Move! Move it out of here! Go!

709
00:59:37.157 --> 00:59:38.943
It's scorching the table! Fast!

710
00:59:39.034 --> 00:59:40.069
- Move!
- Okay!

711
00:59:54.341 --> 00:59:56.832
Well, we have Marcus Brody,

712
00:59:56.927 --> 00:59:59.168
but more important, we have the map.

713
01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:05.098
"By the personal command
of the fiihrer.

714
01:00:05.185 --> 01:00:07.176
"Secrecy essential to success.

715
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:09.682
"Eliminate the American conspirators."

716
01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:13.857
Germany has declared war
on the Jones boys.

717
01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:23.116
Dad! What?

718
01:00:23.203 --> 01:00:24.818
Head for the fireplace!

719
01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:40.630
I think I can get these ropes off.

720
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:55.232
Our situation has not improved.

721
01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:57.559
Listen, dad, I'm almost free.

722
01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:15.372
Alarm!

723
01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:25.595
This is intolerable.

724
01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:27.346
I'm out, dad.

725
01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:29.174
Well done, boy.

726
01:02:05.347 --> 01:02:07.087
Come on, dad.

727
01:02:13.355 --> 01:02:15.141
Dead end.

728
01:02:15.232 --> 01:02:16.472
There's got to be a...

729
01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:19.182
A secret door or a...

730
01:02:19.277 --> 01:02:20.437
Passageway or something.

731
01:02:20.654 --> 01:02:23.817
I find that if I just sit down and think...

732
01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:28.991
Dad!

733
01:02:32.499 --> 01:02:34.615
The solution presents itself.

734
01:02:42.384 --> 01:02:45.000
Great. More boats.

735
01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:51.636
You say this has been
just another typical day for you, huh?

736
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:56.228
No! But better than most.

737
01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:00.769
Come on, dad. Come on.

738
01:03:02.654 --> 01:03:03.894
We're not going on the boat?

739
01:03:19.045 --> 01:03:20.080
Jones!

740
01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:33.821
Halt! Halt!

741
01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:37.846
Stop! What?

742
01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:40.016
Stop! Stop!

743
01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:44.354
You're going the wrong way.
We have to get to Berlin.

744
01:05:44.441 --> 01:05:45.897
Brody's this way.

745
01:05:45.984 --> 01:05:47.770
My diary's in Berlin.

746
01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:49.817
We don't need the diary, dad.

747
01:05:49.904 --> 01:05:51.314
Marcus has the map.

748
01:05:51.406 --> 01:05:54.614
There is more in the diary
than just the map.

749
01:05:54.826 --> 01:05:57.613
All right, dad. Tell me.

750
01:05:59.372 --> 01:06:03.911
Well, he who finds the grail
must face the final challenge.

751
01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:05.788
What final challenge?

752
01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:08.666
Three devices of such lethal cunning.

753
01:06:08.756 --> 01:06:10.371
Booby traps? Yes.

754
01:06:11.843 --> 01:06:15.301
But I found the clues that
will safely take us through,

755
01:06:15.388 --> 01:06:17.595
in the chronicles of st anselm.

756
01:06:17.682 --> 01:06:19.297
Well, what are they?

757
01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:24.219
Can't you remember?

758
01:06:26.191 --> 01:06:30.104
I wrote them down in my diary
so that I wouldn't have to remember.

759
01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:33.736
Half the German army's on our fail,
and you want me to go to Berlin?

760
01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:35.814
Into the lion's den? Yes.

761
01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:38.070
The only thing that matters is the grail.

762
01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:39.617
What about Marcus?

763
01:06:39.704 --> 01:06:41.285
Marcus would agree with me.

764
01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:44.121
Two selfless martyrs.

765
01:06:44.209 --> 01:06:45.540
Jesus Christ.

766
01:06:49.297 --> 01:06:51.879
That's for blasphemy.

767
01:06:54.636 --> 01:06:58.254
The quest for the grail
is not archeology.

768
01:06:59.766 --> 01:07:01.927
It's a race against evil.

769
01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:04.805
If it is captured by the Nazis,

770
01:07:04.896 --> 01:07:08.514
the armies of darkness
will march all over the face of the earth.

771
01:07:08.608 --> 01:07:09.688
Do you understand me?

772
01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:13.685
This is an obsession, dad.

773
01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:17.022
I never understood it. Never.

774
01:07:19.285 --> 01:07:21.196
Neither did mom.

775
01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:22.948
Yes, she did.

776
01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:24.950
Only too well.

777
01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:29.789
Unfortunately, she kept
her illness from me

778
01:07:31.256 --> 01:07:32.792
until all I could do was mourn her.

779
01:08:35.528 --> 01:08:38.861
My boy, we are pilgrims
in an unholy land.

780
01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:10.556
Fraulein doctor.

781
01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:12.975
- Where is it?
- How did you get here?

782
01:09:13.066 --> 01:09:15.102
Where is it? I want it.

783
01:09:18.363 --> 01:09:20.900
You came back for the book? Why?

784
01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:23.489
My father didn't want it incinerated.

785
01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:25.191
Is that what you think of me?

786
01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:27.652
I believe in the grail, not the swastika.

787
01:09:27.747 --> 01:09:29.078
But you stood up to be counted

788
01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:31.497
with the enemy of everything
that the grail stands for.

789
01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:33.120
Who gives a damn what you think?

790
01:09:33.211 --> 01:09:35.247
You do.

791
01:09:35.338 --> 01:09:38.421
All I have to do is squeeze.

792
01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:41.257
All I have to do 1s scream.

793
01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:53.853
I've got it. Let's get
the hell out of here.

794
01:11:06.554 --> 01:11:07.740
- What did you get?
- I don't know.

795
01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:09.283
First available flight out of Germany.

796
01:11:09.307 --> 01:11:11.013
Good.

797
01:11:37.043 --> 01:11:39.375
Well, we made it.

798
01:11:40.505 --> 01:11:43.372
When we're airborne,
with Germany behind us,

799
01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:45.798
then I'll share that sentiment.

800
01:11:45.885 --> 01:11:47.500
Relax.

801
01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:35.347
Tickets, please.

802
01:12:46.487 --> 01:12:49.945
Guten tag, herr Jones.

803
01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.860
Tickets, please.

804
01:13:07.091 --> 01:13:09.002
We should get out of here.

805
01:13:11.095 --> 01:13:12.631
No ticket.

806
01:13:15.558 --> 01:13:16.558
Ticket.

807
01:13:16.642 --> 01:13:18.925
- Ticket!
- Ticket!

808
01:13:36.329 --> 01:13:37.910
You know,

809
01:13:37.997 --> 01:13:42.081
sharing your adventures is
an interesting experience.

810
01:13:43.210 --> 01:13:44.996
That's not all we shared.

811
01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:47.419
It's disgraceful.
You're old enough to be her fa...

812
01:13:47.506 --> 01:13:48.916
Her grandfather.

813
01:13:49.508 --> 01:13:50.998
Well, I'm as human as the next man.

814
01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:53.004
I was the next man.

815
01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:57.554
Of course. Well...

816
01:13:57.642 --> 01:13:59.348
Ships that pass in the night.

817
01:14:00.019 --> 01:14:03.511
Do you remember the last time
we had a quiet drink?

818
01:14:05.316 --> 01:14:07.307
I had a milkshake.

819
01:14:08.235 --> 01:14:10.146
What did we talk about?

820
01:14:11.238 --> 01:14:13.024
We didn't talk.

821
01:14:14.075 --> 01:14:16.031
We never talked.

822
01:14:17.703 --> 01:14:20.115
Do I detect a rebuke?

823
01:14:21.666 --> 01:14:24.453
A regret. It was just the two of us, dad.

824
01:14:24.543 --> 01:14:27.080
It was a lonely way to grow up.
For you, too.

825
01:14:27.171 --> 01:14:28.811
If you'd been an ordinary,
average father,

826
01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:31.001
like the other guys' dads,
you'd have understood that.

827
01:14:31.842 --> 01:14:34.174
Actually, I was a wonderful father.

828
01:14:34.261 --> 01:14:35.797
When?

829
01:14:36.514 --> 01:14:38.926
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed?

830
01:14:39.016 --> 01:14:40.472
Wash your ears? Do your homework?

831
01:14:40.559 --> 01:14:45.519
No. I respected your privacy,
and I taught you self-reliance.

832
01:14:45.606 --> 01:14:48.188
What you taught me was
that I was less important to you

833
01:14:48.275 --> 01:14:51.642
than people who'd been dead
for 500 years in another country.

834
01:14:51.737 --> 01:14:53.693
And I learned it so well

835
01:14:53.781 --> 01:14:55.988
that we've hardly spoken for 20 years.

836
01:14:56.075 --> 01:14:58.908
You left just when
you were becoming interesting.

837
01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:00.075
Unbelievable.

838
01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:01.948
- Dad, how can you...
- Very well.

839
01:15:02.039 --> 01:15:03.995
I'm here now.

840
01:15:05.376 --> 01:15:06.991
What do you want to talk about?

841
01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:10.168
Well, I...

842
01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:20.004
I can't think of anything.

843
01:15:20.391 --> 01:15:22.347
Then what are you complaining about?

844
01:15:23.978 --> 01:15:25.889
Look, we have work to do.

845
01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:32.563
When we get to alexandretta,
we will face three challenges.

846
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:38.030
The first, "the breath of god.
Only the penitent man will pass."

847
01:15:38.117 --> 01:15:41.234
Second, "the word of god.

848
01:15:41.328 --> 01:15:44.365
"Only in the footsteps of god
will he proceed."

849
01:15:44.457 --> 01:15:46.789
Third, "the path of god.

850
01:15:47.251 --> 01:15:52.621
"Only in the leap from the lion's head
will he prove his worth."

851
01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:56.215
What does that mean?

852
01:15:56.302 --> 01:15:59.214
I don't know. We'll find out.

853
01:16:06.479 --> 01:16:09.016
We're turning around.

854
01:16:09.106 --> 01:16:11.017
They're taking us back to Germany.

855
01:16:18.074 --> 01:16:19.634
Well, I thought it would
take them a lot longer

856
01:16:19.658 --> 01:16:20.969
to figure out the radio was dead.

857
01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:22.654
Come on, dad. Move!

858
01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:29.449
Come on, dad. Come on!

859
01:16:43.099 --> 01:16:45.181
I didn't know you could fly a plane.

860
01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:46.347
Fly, yes.

861
01:16:48.562 --> 01:16:50.518
Land, no.

862
01:17:14.839 --> 01:17:16.733
Dad, you're going to have to
use the machine gun.

863
01:17:16.757 --> 01:17:18.497
Get it ready.

864
01:17:19.885 --> 01:17:21.250
Eleven o'clock!

865
01:17:22.012 --> 01:17:23.593
Dad, eleven o'clock!

866
01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:27.548
What happens at eleven o'clock?

867
01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:29.304
Twelve, eleven, ten.

868
01:17:29.395 --> 01:17:32.057
Eleven o'clock, fire!

869
01:17:57.673 --> 01:18:00.380
Dad, are we hit?

870
01:18:00.467 --> 01:18:02.082
More or less.

871
01:18:02.636 --> 01:18:04.501
Son, I'm sorry.

872
01:18:04.597 --> 01:18:06.053
They got us.

873
01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:10.261
Hang on, dad. We're going in!

874
01:18:23.324 --> 01:18:25.781
- Nice landing.
- Thanks.

875
01:18:41.091 --> 01:18:42.402
Those people are trying to kill us!

876
01:18:42.426 --> 01:18:44.166
I know, dad!

877
01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:47.469
Well. It's a new experience for me.

878
01:18:47.806 --> 01:18:49.421
It happens to me all the time.

879
01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:21.878
This is intolerable!

880
01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:24.624
This could be close.

881
01:19:33.852 --> 01:19:35.513
Faster, boy! Faster!

882
01:19:51.245 --> 01:19:53.531
Well, they don't come
any closer than that!

883
01:20:09.471 --> 01:20:12.634
Dad, he's coming back!

884
01:20:59.229 --> 01:21:01.845
I suddenly
remembered my charlemagne.

885
01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:04.773
"Let my armies be
the rocks and the trees

886
01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:07.101
"and the birds in the sky."

887
01:21:24.922 --> 01:21:28.335
These pages are taken from
professor Jones' diary, your highness,

888
01:21:28.425 --> 01:21:29.710
and they include a map

889
01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:32.794
that pinpoints
the exact location of the grail.

890
01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:35.630
As you can see,
the grail is all but in our hands.

891
01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:36.930
However, your highness,

892
01:21:37.017 --> 01:21:39.929
we would not think of crossing your soil
without your permission,

893
01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:42.011
nor of removing the grail
from your borders

894
01:21:42.106 --> 01:21:45.143
without suitable compensation.

895
01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:49.943
What have you brought?

896
01:21:57.579 --> 01:22:00.116
Precious valuables, your highness,

897
01:22:00.207 --> 01:22:04.416
donated by some of the finest families
in all of Germany.

898
01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:12.378
Rolls-Royce phantom two.

899
01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:16.587
Four-point-three liter, 30 horsepower,
six-cylinder engine,

900
01:22:16.682 --> 01:22:19.469
with stromberg downdraft carburetor.

901
01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:22.848
Can go from zero to
100 kilometers an hour

902
01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:25.771
in 12.5 seconds.

903
01:22:25.858 --> 01:22:27.394
And I even like the color.

904
01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.897
The keys are in the ignition,
your highness.

905
01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:35.106
You shall have camels, horses,

906
01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.612
an armed escort, provisions,

907
01:22:37.703 --> 01:22:40.365
desert vehicles and tanks.

908
01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:42.196
You're welcome.

909
01:22:57.973 --> 01:22:59.088
We have no time to lose.

910
01:22:59.183 --> 01:23:01.720
Indiana Jones
and his father have escaped.

911
01:23:04.730 --> 01:23:06.311
We go this way.

912
01:23:06.482 --> 01:23:07.972
Get that camel out of the way.

913
01:23:10.486 --> 01:23:12.693
What happened to Marcus, sallah?

914
01:23:12.779 --> 01:23:15.270
They set out across the desert
this afternoon.

915
01:23:15.365 --> 01:23:18.607
I believe they took Mr. Brody with them.

916
01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:22.111
Now they have the map.

917
01:23:23.582 --> 01:23:25.197
And in this sort of race,

918
01:23:25.292 --> 01:23:28.159
there's no silver medal
for finishing second.

919
01:23:50.609 --> 01:23:53.066
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?

920
01:23:53.153 --> 01:23:55.018
I'd rather spit in your face.

921
01:23:55.113 --> 01:23:57.604
But as I haven't got any spit...

922
01:23:59.993 --> 01:24:02.860
Must be within three or four miles.

923
01:24:02.955 --> 01:24:05.537
Otherwise we are off the map.

924
01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:10.660
Well, Marcus,
we are on the brink of the recovery of

925
01:24:10.754 --> 01:24:14.372
the greatest artifact
in the history of mankind.

926
01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:18.254
You're meddling with powers
you cannot possibly comprehend.

927
01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:27.263
I see Brody.

928
01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:34.766
They've got a tank.

929
01:24:40.242 --> 01:24:42.073
Six-pound gun.

930
01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:44.025
What do you think you're doing there?
Get down!

931
01:24:44.955 --> 01:24:46.991
Dad, we're well out of range.

932
01:24:57.301 --> 01:24:58.528
That car belonged to my brother-in-law.

933
01:24:58.552 --> 01:25:00.088
Come on, come on!

934
01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:02.427
I can't see anyone up there.

935
01:25:02.514 --> 01:25:03.754
Maybe it wasn't even Jones.

936
01:25:03.849 --> 01:25:06.090
No, it is him, all right.

937
01:25:06.184 --> 01:25:07.799
He's here somewhere.

938
01:25:08.854 --> 01:25:10.810
Put Brody in the tank.

939
01:25:17.738 --> 01:25:20.525
Well, in this sun,

940
01:25:20.616 --> 01:25:22.948
without transportation,
they're as good as dead.

941
01:25:32.544 --> 01:25:33.875
It's Jones, all right.

942
01:25:38.383 --> 01:25:40.465
Now, who are all these people?
“Who cares?

943
01:25:40.552 --> 01:25:42.383
As long as
they're keeping Donovan busy.

944
01:25:43.221 --> 01:25:46.805
Dad, you stay here while sallah and I
organize some transportation.

945
01:26:11.958 --> 01:26:13.978
- I'm going after those horses.
- I'll take the camels.

946
01:26:14.002 --> 01:26:15.583
- I don't need camels.
- But, indy...

947
01:26:15.671 --> 01:26:17.081
No camels.

948
01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:29.465
Who is he?

949
01:26:31.061 --> 01:26:33.177
A messenger from god.

950
01:26:34.648 --> 01:26:36.980
For the unrighteous,

951
01:26:37.067 --> 01:26:40.651
the cup of life
holds everlasting damnation.

952
01:26:59.798 --> 01:27:01.880
Marcus!

953
01:27:03.468 --> 01:27:05.629
"Genius of the restoration..."

954
01:27:06.096 --> 01:27:08.462
"Aid our own resuscitation."

955
01:27:08.557 --> 01:27:09.797
Henry, what are you doing here?

956
01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:11.215
It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.

957
01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:19.226
Search him.

958
01:27:20.152 --> 01:27:21.983
What is in this book?

959
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:25.483
That miserable little diary of yours.

960
01:27:25.949 --> 01:27:27.985
We have the map. The book is useless.

961
01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:30.943
And yet you come all the way back
to Berlin to get it.

962
01:27:31.037 --> 01:27:32.652
Why?

963
01:27:32.748 --> 01:27:34.784
What are you hiding?

964
01:27:35.167 --> 01:27:38.375
What does the diary tell you
that it doesn't tell us?

965
01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:43.581
It tells me that goose-stepping morons
like yourself

966
01:27:43.675 --> 01:27:46.758
should try reading books
instead of burning them.

967
01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:48.335
Colonel!

968
01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:50.421
Jones is getting away.

969
01:27:50.515 --> 01:27:51.595
I think not,

970
01:27:51.892 --> 01:27:53.007
herr Donovan.

971
01:27:53.226 --> 01:27:56.059
Not that Jones, the other Jones!

972
01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:07.442
Sallah, I said no camels!

973
01:28:07.532 --> 01:28:09.773
That's five camels. Can't you count?

974
01:28:09.868 --> 01:28:12.200
Compensation for
my brother-in-law's car.

975
01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:14.323
Indy, your father and Brody...

976
01:28:14.623 --> 01:28:15.783
Where's my father?

977
01:28:15.874 --> 01:28:17.034
They have them.

978
01:28:17.334 --> 01:28:19.370
In the belly of that steel beast.

979
01:28:42.567 --> 01:28:43.602
Firel

980
01:30:44.564 --> 01:30:46.850
Dad! Dad!

981
01:30:46.942 --> 01:30:49.183
Dad! Junior?

982
01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:50.608
Junior?

983
01:30:50.862 --> 01:30:52.022
Junior!

984
01:32:07.605 --> 01:32:09.220
Dad!

985
01:32:09.983 --> 01:32:11.063
Dad!

986
01:32:11.192 --> 01:32:12.932
Dad! Get out!

987
01:33:33.399 --> 01:33:34.684
Henry, the pen...

988
01:33:34.943 --> 01:33:36.353
- What?
- But don't you see?

989
01:33:36.444 --> 01:33:39.686
The pen is mightier than the sword.

990
01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:03.630
Look what you did.

991
01:34:03.721 --> 01:34:05.211
It's war.

992
01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:13.557
Didn't I tell you it was a rescue?

993
01:35:17.587 --> 01:35:19.669
Dad! Yeah?

994
01:35:20.632 --> 01:35:22.122
You call this archeology?

995
01:35:22.217 --> 01:35:23.377
Get out of there, dad.

996
01:35:34.687 --> 01:35:36.393
How does one get off this thing?

997
01:35:43.321 --> 01:35:44.436
Where's Marcus?

998
01:35:49.118 --> 01:35:50.699
Dad!

999
01:35:54.123 --> 01:35:55.283
Hang on, dad!

1000
01:36:02.173 --> 01:36:04.209
Father of indy, give me your hand!

1001
01:36:06.177 --> 01:36:07.462
Get dad!

1002
01:36:07.553 --> 01:36:09.339
Give me your hand!

1003
01:36:58.104 --> 01:36:59.890
Junior!

1004
01:37:01.774 --> 01:37:03.856
Indy!

1005
01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:14.526
Oh, god.

1006
01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:16.736
I've lost him.

1007
01:37:20.335 --> 01:37:22.951
And I never told him anything.

1008
01:37:25.465 --> 01:37:28.002
I just wasn't ready, Marcus.

1009
01:37:29.010 --> 01:37:31.672
Five minutes would have been enough.

1010
01:38:08.633 --> 01:38:11.295
I thought I'd lost you, boy!

1011
01:38:12.804 --> 01:38:14.965
I thought you had too, sir.

1012
01:38:27.985 --> 01:38:29.521
Well...

1013
01:38:31.781 --> 01:38:34.818
Well done. Come on.

1014
01:38:37.870 --> 01:38:39.656
Let's go, then.

1015
01:38:42.166 --> 01:38:45.124
Why are you sitting there resting
when we're so near the end?

1016
01:38:45.211 --> 01:38:47.167
Come on, let's go!

1017
01:38:59.684 --> 01:39:03.427
The canyon of the Crescent moon.

1018
01:41:31.002 --> 01:41:32.287
Helmut, another volunteer!

1019
01:42:01.490 --> 01:42:04.152
I never expected to see you again.

1020
01:42:04.243 --> 01:42:06.655
I'm like a bad penny, I always turn up.

1021
01:42:06.746 --> 01:42:10.409
Step back now, Dr. Schneider.
Give Dr. Jones some room.

1022
01:42:11.167 --> 01:42:13.453
He's going to recover the grail for us.

1023
01:42:16.547 --> 01:42:20.756
Impossible? What do you say, Jones?
Ready to go down in history?

1024
01:42:20.843 --> 01:42:23.926
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?

1025
01:42:24.013 --> 01:42:25.549
The Nazis?

1026
01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:28.052
Is that the limit of your vision?

1027
01:42:28.434 --> 01:42:32.097
The Nazis want to write themselves
into the grail legend,

1028
01:42:32.188 --> 01:42:33.598
take on the world.

1029
01:42:34.315 --> 01:42:36.226
Well, they're welcome.

1030
01:42:37.401 --> 01:42:39.483
But I want the grail itself.

1031
01:42:39.570 --> 01:42:42.687
The cup that gives everlasting life.

1032
01:42:47.328 --> 01:42:51.241
I'm going to be drinking my own health
when he's gone the way of the dodo.

1033
01:42:55.211 --> 01:42:57.452
The grail is mine,

1034
01:42:57.546 --> 01:42:59.502
and you're going to get it for me.

1035
01:42:59.590 --> 01:43:01.581
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.

1036
01:43:02.051 --> 01:43:03.791
You know something, Dr. Jones?

1037
01:43:03.886 --> 01:43:05.797
You're absolutely right.

1038
01:43:08.474 --> 01:43:09.509
Dad?

1039
01:43:10.768 --> 01:43:11.928
Dad?

1040
01:43:12.603 --> 01:43:13.683
Junior...

1041
01:43:13.771 --> 01:43:15.557
- No!
- Get back!

1042
01:43:33.582 --> 01:43:35.618
You can't save him when you're dead!

1043
01:43:36.001 --> 01:43:37.241
The healing power of the grail

1044
01:43:37.336 --> 01:43:39.372
is the only thing
that can save your father now.

1045
01:43:39.463 --> 01:43:42.921
It's time to ask yourself
what you believe.

1046
01:44:18.461 --> 01:44:20.452
"The breath of god.

1047
01:44:21.672 --> 01:44:24.334
"Only the penitent man will pass."

1048
01:44:25.634 --> 01:44:28.171
"The penitent man will pass."

1049
01:44:46.238 --> 01:44:49.526
The penitent man will pass.

1050
01:44:49.617 --> 01:44:51.653
The penitent man...

1051
01:44:54.079 --> 01:44:59.248
"Only the penitent man will pass."

1052
01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:03.419
The penitent man will pass.
The penitent, penitent...

1053
01:45:03.506 --> 01:45:04.791
The penitent man...

1054
01:45:04.965 --> 01:45:07.502
The penitent man... the penitent...

1055
01:45:07.885 --> 01:45:10.627
The penitent man is humble before god.

1056
01:45:10.721 --> 01:45:12.461
Penitent. Penitent...

1057
01:45:12.556 --> 01:45:14.296
The penitent man...

1058
01:45:14.558 --> 01:45:17.174
Penitent man is humble,

1059
01:45:17.645 --> 01:45:19.351
kneels before god.

1060
01:45:19.438 --> 01:45:21.303
Kneell

1061
01:45:29.198 --> 01:45:30.483
I'm through!

1062
01:45:32.743 --> 01:45:34.108
We're through.

1063
01:45:36.247 --> 01:45:37.828
He's all right.

1064
01:45:37.915 --> 01:45:39.246
No.

1065
01:45:39.875 --> 01:45:42.617
The second challenge:
"The word of god."

1066
01:45:42.711 --> 01:45:46.454
"Only in the footsteps of god
will he proceed."

1067
01:45:50.135 --> 01:45:52.501
The word of god...

1068
01:45:52.596 --> 01:45:53.881
The word of...

1069
01:45:56.976 --> 01:46:00.560
Proceed in the footsteps of the word.

1070
01:46:00.771 --> 01:46:03.934
- "The word of god..."
- No, Henry. Try not to talk.

1071
01:46:11.156 --> 01:46:12.896
The name of god...

1072
01:46:14.618 --> 01:46:17.109
The name of god...

1073
01:46:18.789 --> 01:46:20.996
Jehovah.

1074
01:46:21.542 --> 01:46:26.832
But in the Latin alphabet,
jehovah begins with an "I."

1075
01:46:27.548 --> 01:46:28.708
J...

1076
01:46:34.889 --> 01:46:36.095
Oh, dear.

1077
01:46:40.311 --> 01:46:42.222
Idiot!

1078
01:46:42.313 --> 01:46:44.679
In Latin, jehovah starts with an "I."

1079
01:46:49.695 --> 01:46:50.730
"E"

1080
01:46:52.406 --> 01:46:53.441
"h."

1081
01:46:54.033 --> 01:46:55.523
"Oo"

1082
01:46:56.702 --> 01:46:58.192
"vv."

1083
01:46:58.287 --> 01:46:59.743
"A"

1084
01:47:22.227 --> 01:47:23.842
"The path of god."

1085
01:47:27.650 --> 01:47:29.606
"Only in the leap from the lion's head

1086
01:47:30.527 --> 01:47:32.859
"will he prove his worth."

1087
01:47:36.617 --> 01:47:39.700
Impossible, nobody can jump this.

1088
01:47:42.581 --> 01:47:43.581
Indy!

1089
01:47:44.208 --> 01:47:45.664
Indy, you must hurry!

1090
01:47:45.876 --> 01:47:47.537
Come quickly!

1091
01:47:53.467 --> 01:47:56.004
It's a leap of faith.

1092
01:47:56.095 --> 01:47:57.380
Oh, geez...

1093
01:47:57.721 --> 01:47:59.962
You must believe, boy.

1094
01:48:00.057 --> 01:48:02.469
You must believe.

1095
01:49:49.249 --> 01:49:51.740
I knew you'd come,

1096
01:49:51.835 --> 01:49:54.076
but my strength has left me.

1097
01:49:54.838 --> 01:49:55.998
Who are you?

1098
01:49:56.507 --> 01:49:58.623
The last of three brothers

1099
01:49:58.717 --> 01:50:01.800
who swore an oath to find the grail

1100
01:50:01.887 --> 01:50:03.752
and to guard it.

1101
01:50:04.723 --> 01:50:06.338
That was 700 years ago.

1102
01:50:06.683 --> 01:50:09.015
A long time to wait.

1103
01:50:11.146 --> 01:50:14.638
You're strangely dressed, for a knight.

1104
01:50:15.484 --> 01:50:17.270
I'm not exactly...

1105
01:50:18.153 --> 01:50:19.768
A knight? What do you mean?

1106
01:50:20.364 --> 01:50:22.070
I was chosen

1107
01:50:22.157 --> 01:50:25.695
because I was the bravest,
the most worthy.

1108
01:50:25.786 --> 01:50:29.119
The honor was mine until another came

1109
01:50:29.206 --> 01:50:32.369
to challenge me to single combat.

1110
01:50:33.544 --> 01:50:39.505
I pass it to you who vanquished me.

1111
01:50:42.970 --> 01:50:45.382
Listen, I don't have
time to explain, but...

1112
01:51:02.406 --> 01:51:03.816
Which one is it?

1113
01:51:04.241 --> 01:51:06.482
You must choose,

1114
01:51:06.577 --> 01:51:08.693
but choose wisely.

1115
01:51:08.787 --> 01:51:12.154
For as the true grail will bring you life,

1116
01:51:12.249 --> 01:51:13.284
the false grail

1117
01:51:13.709 --> 01:51:15.574
will take it from you.

1118
01:51:21.592 --> 01:51:23.332
I'm not a historian.

1119
01:51:23.427 --> 01:51:25.463
I have no idea what it looks like.

1120
01:51:25.554 --> 01:51:27.920
Which one is it?

1121
01:51:28.015 --> 01:51:29.630
Let me choose.

1122
01:51:30.601 --> 01:51:32.557
Thank you, doctor.

1123
01:51:45.490 --> 01:51:47.446
Yes.

1124
01:51:52.998 --> 01:51:56.456
It's more beautiful
than I'd ever imagined.

1125
01:52:07.804 --> 01:52:11.137
This certainly is the cup of
the king of kings.

1126
01:52:17.606 --> 01:52:19.597
Eternal life.

1127
01:52:54.559 --> 01:52:56.971
What is happening to me?

1128
01:53:01.525 --> 01:53:03.390
Tell me, what is happening?

1129
01:53:26.717 --> 01:53:28.878
He chose

1130
01:53:28.969 --> 01:53:30.709
poorly.

1131
01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:43.017
It would not be made out of gold.

1132
01:53:43.108 --> 01:53:45.269
That's the cup of a carpenter.

1133
01:53:55.412 --> 01:53:57.323
There's only one way to find out.

1134
01:54:11.928 --> 01:54:15.671
You have chosen wisely.

1135
01:54:16.767 --> 01:54:21.056
But the grail cannot pass
beyond the great seal.

1136
01:54:21.146 --> 01:54:26.266
That is the boundary
and the price of immortality.

1137
01:55:52.779 --> 01:55:55.566
Drop your guns. Please.

1138
01:55:58.910 --> 01:56:00.696
Dad, come on, get to your feet.

1139
01:56:15.302 --> 01:56:17.258
We have got it. Come on!

1140
01:56:18.722 --> 01:56:21.134
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!

1141
01:56:21.641 --> 01:56:23.256
It's ours, indy, yours and mine.

1142
01:56:23.810 --> 01:56:25.846
Elsa, don't cross the seal.

1143
01:56:25.937 --> 01:56:28.895
The knight warned us
not to take the grail from here.

1144
01:56:55.509 --> 01:56:58.421
Junior!

1145
01:57:00.847 --> 01:57:02.053
Elsa...

1146
01:57:03.266 --> 01:57:05.131
Elsa, don't. Elsa...

1147
01:57:05.519 --> 01:57:06.929
Elsa...

1148
01:57:07.020 --> 01:57:09.352
Give me your other hand, honey.
I can't hold youl!

1149
01:57:09.439 --> 01:57:11.680
I can reach it. I can reach it.

1150
01:57:11.775 --> 01:57:14.391
Elsa, give me your hand.
Give me your other hand!

1151
01:57:17.113 --> 01:57:18.398
Elsal

1152
01:57:28.667 --> 01:57:30.282
Junior, give me your other hand!

1153
01:57:30.377 --> 01:57:32.288
I can't hold on.

1154
01:57:32.379 --> 01:57:33.585
I can get it.

1155
01:57:33.672 --> 01:57:35.958
I can almost reach it, dad.

1156
01:57:36.508 --> 01:57:38.214
Indiana...

1157
01:57:39.427 --> 01:57:40.633
Indiana...

1158
01:57:44.015 --> 01:57:46.222
Let it go.

1159
01:58:05.495 --> 01:58:07.076
Dad...

1160
01:58:13.670 --> 01:58:15.501
Please, dad.

1161
01:58:46.995 --> 01:58:49.828
Elsa never really believed in the grail.

1162
01:58:49.914 --> 01:58:52.781
She thought she'd found a prize.

1163
01:58:59.049 --> 01:59:01.165
What did you find, dad?

1164
01:59:01.384 --> 01:59:02.874
Me?

1165
01:59:05.513 --> 01:59:07.674
Illumination.

1166
01:59:16.858 --> 01:59:18.064
And what did you find, junior?

1167
01:59:18.610 --> 01:59:20.601
"Junior'? Dad...

1168
01:59:20.695 --> 01:59:23.186
Please, what does it always mean,
this... this "junior"?

1169
01:59:23.281 --> 01:59:26.148
That's his name: Henry Jones, junior.

1170
01:59:26.242 --> 01:59:28.073
I like Indiana.

1171
01:59:28.161 --> 01:59:30.152
We named the dog Indiana.

1172
01:59:30.246 --> 01:59:32.407
May we go home now, please?

1173
01:59:32.499 --> 01:59:33.659
The dog?

1174
01:59:34.542 --> 01:59:36.828
You are named after the dog?

1175
01:59:39.297 --> 01:59:42.915
I've got a lot of fond memories
of that dog.

1176
01:59:44.302 --> 01:59:46.839
- Ready?
- Ready.

1177
01:59:46.930 --> 01:59:50.138
Indy! Henry! Follow me. I know the way!

1178
01:59:55.939 --> 01:59:57.804
Got lost in his own museum, huh?

1179
01:59:59.734 --> 02:00:02.191
After you, junior.

1180
02:00:02.278 --> 02:00:04.018
Yes, sir.
