00:00:49.278 --> 00:00:50.879
[siren wailing]

2
00:00:52.948 --> 00:00:54.550
[tires screeching]

3
00:00:54.617 --> 00:00:56.552
[wailing continues]

4
00:01:06.295 --> 00:01:08.531
[door shuts]

5
00:01:21.276 --> 00:01:23.479
- Car smash?
- Yeah.

6
00:01:23.546 --> 00:01:26.849
Cement truck
hit one of those Baby Austins.

7
00:01:26.915 --> 00:01:28.884
Fractured skull, I guess.

8
00:01:34.122 --> 00:01:37.926
You know, man's a fool
to ride in those miniature cars.

9
00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:38.894
You mean yourself.

10
00:01:38.961 --> 00:01:41.597
This is the guy
that drove the truck.

11
00:01:45.534 --> 00:01:49.104
- Aww, boy?
- Little girl!

12
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:53.376
Ah. Ahem.
Uh-huh.

13
00:01:53.442 --> 00:01:57.946
Gee, I-I hope
my baby's a boy.

14
00:01:58.013 --> 00:01:59.382
I'll do my best, Archie.

15
00:01:59.448 --> 00:02:01.584
(Archie)
'Attagirl, Mumfie.'

16
00:02:04.753 --> 00:02:07.155
Why can't my son
have a screen around his bed?

17
00:02:07.222 --> 00:02:10.759
- It's against the rules.
- But this man has one.

18
00:02:10.826 --> 00:02:13.696
- Yes. He's dying.
- Oh.

19
00:02:13.762 --> 00:02:16.064
[speaking in foreign language]

20
00:02:19.502 --> 00:02:22.104
[speaking in foreign language]

21
00:02:23.472 --> 00:02:25.508
Oh, nuts!

22
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.056
What makes you think
you want to be a nurse?

23
00:02:41.123 --> 00:02:43.358
What, nursing people
has always seemed

24
00:02:43.426 --> 00:02:46.261
sort of second nature with me.

25
00:02:46.328 --> 00:02:48.897
This is your
only recommendation?

26
00:02:48.964 --> 00:02:51.767
Who is this gentleman?
What's his business?

27
00:02:51.834 --> 00:02:54.403
- 'He's a grocer.'
- A grocer?

28
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.838
[clears throat]

29
00:02:55.904 --> 00:02:57.673
I'm afraid, he knows
more about groceries

30
00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.241
than he does
about hospitals.

31
00:02:59.307 --> 00:03:02.545
What does he mean by, the time
you were at high school?

32
00:03:02.611 --> 00:03:04.346
'Didn't you graduate?'

33
00:03:04.413 --> 00:03:08.484
No, I had to leave when my
mother died in the third year.

34
00:03:08.551 --> 00:03:10.819
Probationary nurse
must be a high school graduate.

35
00:03:10.886 --> 00:03:13.889
I'll make it up easy enough.
I can go to night school.

36
00:03:13.956 --> 00:03:16.358
'You'll have neither time nor
strength with your work here.'

37
00:03:16.425 --> 00:03:19.628
- Oh, I'm sure I would have--
- 'It wouldn't be allowed.'

38
00:03:19.695 --> 00:03:21.464
I'm sufficiently
well educated.

39
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.999
- There must be some way.
- Not here.

40
00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:27.035
Oh, I'm sure
I can make good if..

41
00:03:27.102 --> 00:03:29.237
My decision is final.

42
00:03:29.304 --> 00:03:30.773
[clears throat]

43
00:03:39.615 --> 00:03:41.450
[clears throat]

44
00:03:49.925 --> 00:03:50.959
Oh, I'm sorry.

45
00:03:51.026 --> 00:03:53.428
You are in a hurry,
aren't you?

46
00:04:19.755 --> 00:04:22.591
- Did I catch the name?
- Hart. Lora Hart.

47
00:04:22.658 --> 00:04:25.694
Hart. That's a good name
for a nurse.

48
00:04:25.761 --> 00:04:27.996
Sturdy instrument, the heart.

49
00:04:30.666 --> 00:04:33.936
- Hello, Miss Dillon.
- Good afternoon, doctor.

50
00:04:34.002 --> 00:04:36.171
Now, what can we do
for this young lady?

51
00:04:36.238 --> 00:04:39.908
My dear, why didn't you
mention the doctor?

52
00:04:39.975 --> 00:04:42.444
Of course, doctor,
anything you say.

53
00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:44.813
Well, now, suppose
you telephone the principal

54
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.550
of Miss Hart's high school and
if everything is satisfactory

55
00:04:47.616 --> 00:04:49.117
we'll waive the rest.

56
00:04:49.184 --> 00:04:51.687
Oh, thank you, doctor.

57
00:04:51.754 --> 00:04:54.623
I hope you realize what
you're letting yourself in for.

58
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.792
Nothing can be too hard.

59
00:04:56.859 --> 00:04:59.995
Now, you take care of her,
will you, Miss Dillon?

60
00:05:00.062 --> 00:05:02.397
I've gotta be going.

61
00:05:02.464 --> 00:05:04.600
This lady will
take care of you.

62
00:05:06.902 --> 00:05:09.437
By the way, Dillon, you're
doing something wonderful

63
00:05:09.504 --> 00:05:10.806
with the hospital.

64
00:05:10.873 --> 00:05:13.075
Everything runs like a clock.

65
00:05:13.141 --> 00:05:15.310
Thank you, doctor.

66
00:05:15.377 --> 00:05:19.181
(Dillon)
'I'm sorry, you didn't mention
Dr. Bell in the beginning.'

67
00:05:23.886 --> 00:05:26.221
You'll find life
here pleasant enough.

68
00:05:26.288 --> 00:05:29.725
But there's one thing
you must understand thoroughly.

69
00:05:29.792 --> 00:05:31.660
Rules mean something.

70
00:05:31.727 --> 00:05:32.795
I understand.

71
00:05:32.861 --> 00:05:34.963
You'll be told
about them later.

72
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.432
You'll have one hour
to yourself each afternoon

73
00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:39.301
and your evenings after seven.

74
00:05:39.367 --> 00:05:42.905
But you're to be in bed
and lights out at ten.

75
00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:46.374
There are no exceptions.

76
00:05:46.441 --> 00:05:48.010
This decision is final.

77
00:05:48.076 --> 00:05:49.077
[clears throat]

78
00:05:49.144 --> 00:05:50.112
I..

79
00:05:50.178 --> 00:05:51.213
[both clear throat]

80
00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:53.181
...see.

81
00:05:53.248 --> 00:05:55.851
You have one night out
a week until 12

82
00:05:55.918 --> 00:05:58.553
and quite a severe penalty
if you're out later.

83
00:06:00.989 --> 00:06:03.592
Miss Maloney,
this is Miss Hart.

84
00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:06.361
How do you do?

85
00:06:06.428 --> 00:06:07.830
Pick Miss Hart
to the wardrobe

86
00:06:07.896 --> 00:06:09.765
'and help her
select some uniforms.'

87
00:06:09.832 --> 00:06:12.167
'She hopes to be a probationer.'

88
00:06:13.836 --> 00:06:15.403
'Miss Maloney will show you.'

89
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.239
Thank you.

90
00:06:17.305 --> 00:06:21.276
'Miss Maloney, uh, you have
no one sleeping in your room?'

91
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.547
'Miss Hart may go with you.'

92
00:06:25.614 --> 00:06:28.483
- Yes, ma'am.
- 'Yes, Miss Dillon.'

93
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.318
Yes, Miss Dillon.

94
00:06:31.854 --> 00:06:33.088
[Dillon clears throat]

95
00:06:39.027 --> 00:06:41.697
I like the new probationer.

96
00:06:41.764 --> 00:06:44.399
- Heads or tails?
- Tails.

97
00:06:44.466 --> 00:06:48.203
Heads. Life is going on
for you in the same old way.

98
00:06:52.074 --> 00:06:54.442
Say, I was afraid
the hospital would burn down

99
00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:55.911
before I could get into it.

100
00:06:55.978 --> 00:06:57.946
Now, I have to watch
myself with matches.

101
00:06:58.013 --> 00:06:59.982
If you hate it,
why do you stay?

102
00:07:00.048 --> 00:07:03.285
'Cause, it's the only job I know
where they pay you to learn.

103
00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:05.721
Oh, I'm sure
in your heart you love it.

104
00:07:05.788 --> 00:07:07.122
Hm...says you.

105
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:10.125
Yeah, says me
in a big way, sister.

106
00:07:17.966 --> 00:07:20.102
Oh, goodness! Isn't
there a smaller one?

107
00:07:20.168 --> 00:07:23.171
Well, if you don't like it,
why don't you buy your own?

108
00:07:23.238 --> 00:07:26.641
- I can't. I haven't any money.
- Broke?

109
00:07:26.709 --> 00:07:28.476
In a big way, sister.

110
00:07:28.543 --> 00:07:30.212
Any advice?

111
00:07:33.315 --> 00:07:35.550
What were you doing
with the big shot?

112
00:07:35.617 --> 00:07:37.119
- Who?
- Dr. Bell.

113
00:07:37.185 --> 00:07:39.387
- Say, you kidding me?
- No. Why?

114
00:07:39.454 --> 00:07:40.823
You don't know Bell?

115
00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:42.557
He's the chief of staff.

116
00:07:42.624 --> 00:07:44.392
One of the biggest
surgeons in America.

117
00:07:44.459 --> 00:07:46.061
Really?

118
00:07:46.128 --> 00:07:49.664
Why, he just stopped me in the
hall and offered to help me.

119
00:07:49.732 --> 00:07:53.769
Hmm, for a beginner,
you're not doing so bad.

120
00:07:55.137 --> 00:07:59.241
We'll see if we can
find one that fits.

121
00:07:59.307 --> 00:08:01.043
Here, try that.

122
00:08:01.109 --> 00:08:02.845
Oh, that's much better.

123
00:08:02.911 --> 00:08:05.714
You better slip off
your dress.

124
00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:08.984
- Oh, it's okay.
- Oh, I suppose so.

125
00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:12.154
I guess, everybody around here
has seen more than I've got.

126
00:08:25.801 --> 00:08:27.602
[knocks]

127
00:08:27.669 --> 00:08:30.739
Oh, don't be embarrassed.
You can't show me a thing.

128
00:08:30.806 --> 00:08:32.841
I just came
from the delivery room.

129
00:08:32.908 --> 00:08:35.710
What are you doing here,
baby frightener?

130
00:08:35.778 --> 00:08:38.146
I come on behalf
of this big institution

131
00:08:38.213 --> 00:08:40.315
to welcome the new sister
to our midst.

132
00:08:40.382 --> 00:08:43.385
You'll find, we're just
one big happy family here.

133
00:08:43.451 --> 00:08:44.887
[chuckling]

134
00:08:44.953 --> 00:08:47.756
- Beat it, Eagan.
- You're not sore, are you?

135
00:08:47.823 --> 00:08:49.457
I'm not laughing,
veterinary.

136
00:08:49.524 --> 00:08:52.327
How do you like to go back
to your sick horses?

137
00:08:52.394 --> 00:08:54.229
Sometimes, I don't
like you, Maloney.

138
00:08:54.296 --> 00:08:57.665
Hmm, if only I could
make that permanent.

139
00:08:57.732 --> 00:08:59.734
What do you say,
newcomer?

140
00:08:59.802 --> 00:09:02.838
The score is two to nothing,
favor of the lady.

141
00:09:06.274 --> 00:09:07.943
Hmm.

142
00:09:10.913 --> 00:09:13.715
Take my tip
and keep away from interns.

143
00:09:13.782 --> 00:09:16.785
They're like cancer, the disease
is known, but not the cure.

144
00:09:16.852 --> 00:09:18.353
Really?

145
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.824
Only one guy in the world
who can do a nurse any good

146
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.258
and that's
a patient with dough.

147
00:09:23.325 --> 00:09:25.293
Catch one with fever
and a low pulse

148
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.163
make him think you saved his
life and you'll get somewhere.

149
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.032
- Will I?
- Doctors are no good either.

150
00:09:30.098 --> 00:09:31.834
- Oh, no?
- What for?

151
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.168
They never marry nurses.

152
00:09:33.235 --> 00:09:35.203
And the trouble
with interns is they do.

153
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.073
All a wife means to an intern
is someone to sit

154
00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.108
in his front office
when he starts practicing.

155
00:09:40.175 --> 00:09:42.777
Play nursemaid the rest
of her life without pay.

156
00:09:42.845 --> 00:09:44.246
Oh, I shouldn't like that.

157
00:09:44.312 --> 00:09:46.915
The thing to do is to
land an appendicitis case.

158
00:09:46.982 --> 00:09:48.851
They've all got dough. All.

159
00:09:50.252 --> 00:09:52.420
Gee, you look like an add
for Sloan's Liniment.

160
00:09:52.487 --> 00:09:56.358
I don't care, as long as it
means I'm not a probe anymore.

161
00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.062
[baby crying]

162
00:10:40.702 --> 00:10:43.605
[crying continues]

163
00:10:51.513 --> 00:10:53.548
[babies crying]

164
00:11:08.496 --> 00:11:10.598
[crying continues]

165
00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:18.606
Oh, dear.

166
00:11:18.673 --> 00:11:20.008
Don't cry.

167
00:11:20.075 --> 00:11:22.810
Yes, it's a shame.

168
00:11:22.877 --> 00:11:26.381
Yes, it's
a shame. There.

169
00:11:40.895 --> 00:11:42.264
[sighs]

170
00:11:49.071 --> 00:11:50.405
Gee, it's half past one.

171
00:11:50.472 --> 00:11:53.775
I was afraid old
hatchet face would see us.

172
00:11:53.841 --> 00:11:58.013
You sap! She'll be in here
to see if we're in bed.

173
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.882
Oh, maybe we better get in
with all our clothes on.

174
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:02.917
No, no, you'd better
slip your dress off

175
00:12:02.985 --> 00:12:05.387
and put it on the end
of the bed here.

176
00:12:05.453 --> 00:12:07.589
If she sees that,
it's okay.

177
00:12:12.694 --> 00:12:16.064
If she switches on the lights
and sees my makeup, I'm sunk.

178
00:12:16.131 --> 00:12:17.899
Well, turn your face
to the wall.

179
00:12:17.966 --> 00:12:19.267
Oh, don't get funny.

180
00:12:19.334 --> 00:12:22.137
My make up goes around
the back of my neck.

181
00:12:25.573 --> 00:12:27.309
Hurry up, kid.

182
00:12:27.375 --> 00:12:30.979
If we're caught this time, it
means a month of no nights off.

183
00:12:34.482 --> 00:12:35.650
[Lora screams]

184
00:12:37.385 --> 00:12:39.621
Oh, some of that goofy
Eagan's comedy.

185
00:12:39.687 --> 00:12:42.690
Well, jump in bed. I'll bet
old hatchet face heard you.

186
00:12:42.757 --> 00:12:44.326
Oh, I can't.
Not with that.

187
00:12:44.392 --> 00:12:45.227
[knocking]

188
00:12:45.293 --> 00:12:47.229
[whispers]
Get in.

189
00:12:50.865 --> 00:12:52.767
[knocking continues]

190
00:12:52.834 --> 00:12:54.269
Come in.

191
00:12:54.336 --> 00:12:57.139
Miss Hart, is it possible
you have a man in here?

192
00:12:57.205 --> 00:13:00.008
You worm. I hope you get caught
in the nurses quarters

193
00:13:00.075 --> 00:13:01.843
you know what
you'll get for that.

194
00:13:01.909 --> 00:13:03.111
Boo!

195
00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.088
[knocking]

196
00:13:13.155 --> 00:13:14.422
Here he is again.

197
00:13:14.489 --> 00:13:17.092
Let him have it,
and make it a bull's-eye.

198
00:13:18.993 --> 00:13:20.328
Come in.

199
00:13:31.073 --> 00:13:33.208
Who threw that slipper?

200
00:13:36.244 --> 00:13:37.745
What, ma'am?

201
00:13:37.812 --> 00:13:39.914
What, Miss Dillon?

202
00:13:39.981 --> 00:13:41.449
What, Miss Dillon?

203
00:13:41.516 --> 00:13:43.485
(Dillon)
'Did you throw that slipper?'

204
00:13:43.551 --> 00:13:46.188
I don't know what
you're talking about.

205
00:13:46.254 --> 00:13:48.490
- Well, Hart?
- Well, you see, I didn't--

206
00:13:48.556 --> 00:13:51.559
Take two weeks on the night
shift in the emergency clinic.

207
00:13:51.626 --> 00:13:53.128
[laughs]

208
00:13:57.699 --> 00:14:00.768
I thought so.
You both just come in.

209
00:14:00.835 --> 00:14:02.137
We had to walk home.

210
00:14:02.204 --> 00:14:04.239
This isn't your
first offence, Miss Maloney.

211
00:14:04.306 --> 00:14:06.674
You'll take four weeks
on the same night shift.

212
00:14:06.741 --> 00:14:08.009
Thank you.

213
00:14:08.076 --> 00:14:10.378
And take two more
for impertinence.

214
00:14:16.851 --> 00:14:18.620
[Dillon clears throat]

215
00:14:18.686 --> 00:14:19.754
[door closes]

216
00:14:19.821 --> 00:14:22.124
See what you get
for yelling?

217
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:25.026
Say, suppose you found
a skeleton in your bed.

218
00:14:25.093 --> 00:14:28.563
(Maloney)
If I could dodge that night
shift, I'd live with one.

219
00:14:29.864 --> 00:14:32.066
Oh, ho.
Hmm.

220
00:14:33.635 --> 00:14:37.205
Quit your trembling, kid,
it can't walk around.

221
00:14:37.272 --> 00:14:40.108
Dillon's face took
all the pep out of it.

222
00:14:43.811 --> 00:14:48.116
Well...at least it
can't clear it's throat.

223
00:14:48.183 --> 00:14:49.351
[clears throat]

224
00:14:50.852 --> 00:14:52.487
[siren wailing]

225
00:14:59.761 --> 00:15:01.696
Just a scalp wound.

226
00:15:08.136 --> 00:15:09.504
Oh, doctor.

227
00:15:09.571 --> 00:15:11.539
Hold tight to my hand
when it hurts.

228
00:15:11.606 --> 00:15:15.009
You're certainly charitable
with that hand of yours.

229
00:15:15.076 --> 00:15:18.880
- Was he hit anywhere else?
- Sorry, but that's all.

230
00:15:22.884 --> 00:15:25.553
Just put a bandage on him.

231
00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.455
Give him a shot of anti-tetanus.

232
00:15:27.522 --> 00:15:30.558
- W-w-what's that for?
- Prevents lockjaw.

233
00:15:30.625 --> 00:15:31.826
L-l-lockjaw?

234
00:15:31.893 --> 00:15:33.261
Ask Miss Maloney about it

235
00:15:33.328 --> 00:15:35.297
she's been fighting it off
all her life.

236
00:15:35.363 --> 00:15:36.764
Grit your teeth, prisoner

237
00:15:36.831 --> 00:15:39.934
just two more smart cracks
and Dr. Mayo was through.

238
00:15:40.001 --> 00:15:41.369
Do-on't!

239
00:15:41.436 --> 00:15:43.438
Shall I take him
to the station house?

240
00:15:43.505 --> 00:15:47.675
I don't think we'd better.
Let's keep him here tonight.

241
00:15:47.742 --> 00:15:50.144
Yeah, prison ward.

242
00:15:58.953 --> 00:16:01.223
Come on. Come on.

243
00:16:06.394 --> 00:16:08.763
- Hey, hey.
- The tougher, the softer.

244
00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:11.666
Better give us a lift,
lunkhead, he's fainted.

245
00:16:11.733 --> 00:16:13.501
Huh?

246
00:16:14.469 --> 00:16:17.472
Oh, alright,
Florence Nightingale.

247
00:16:28.416 --> 00:16:31.686
Could a guy bum some bandages
and iodine in here?

248
00:16:31.753 --> 00:16:34.121
- Are you hurt?
- No, it's a friend of mine.

249
00:16:34.188 --> 00:16:36.157
He got a little cut
in his hand.

250
00:16:36.224 --> 00:16:38.192
Come in, I'll see
what I can do.

251
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.828
Maybe I better
wait here.

252
00:16:40.895 --> 00:16:43.298
- Come in.
- Ouch!

253
00:16:43.365 --> 00:16:46.834
You're the one
that's hurt.

254
00:16:46.901 --> 00:16:48.836
Alright, I'll come in.

255
00:16:51.773 --> 00:16:53.708
Let's see your hand.

256
00:16:57.279 --> 00:16:58.713
You'll have to
get up earlier

257
00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.548
than most bootleggers
do to fool me.

258
00:17:00.615 --> 00:17:02.250
Huh? How'd you
get that way?

259
00:17:02.317 --> 00:17:04.486
We get a good many
like you in here.

260
00:17:04.552 --> 00:17:06.721
- Give us the iodine, will you?
- I'll fix it.

261
00:17:06.788 --> 00:17:10.224
Say, I could do it myself
if you just give me the..

262
00:17:12.126 --> 00:17:14.562
I guess, I better sit down.

263
00:17:18.199 --> 00:17:21.703
- Hey, what's the idea?
- It's the arm, isn't it?

264
00:17:21.769 --> 00:17:23.438
Oh, alright.

265
00:17:25.473 --> 00:17:27.675
Eh, this one here.

266
00:17:32.213 --> 00:17:33.581
Thanks.

267
00:17:44.992 --> 00:17:46.394
Say, that's silk.

268
00:17:46.461 --> 00:17:48.863
That's how I know
you're a bootlegger.

269
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:49.897
[laughs]

270
00:17:49.964 --> 00:17:53.635
You win.

271
00:17:53.701 --> 00:17:55.269
That looks like
a bullet wound.

272
00:17:55.337 --> 00:17:58.272
Well, it is, since it ain't
a vaccination mark.

273
00:18:03.511 --> 00:18:05.880
I'll have to make a
police report of this.

274
00:18:05.947 --> 00:18:08.583
Yeah? Why?

275
00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:11.285
It has to be done
on all bullet wound cases.

276
00:18:11.353 --> 00:18:13.321
- Oh, say, that ain't necessary.
- I have to.

277
00:18:13.388 --> 00:18:15.156
Oh, listen, sister.
What's the difference to you?

278
00:18:15.222 --> 00:18:18.025
I could get into a lot
of trouble if I didn't.

279
00:18:18.092 --> 00:18:21.763
Listen, give me some bandages
and forget you ever saw me.

280
00:18:24.966 --> 00:18:26.668
How did it happen?

281
00:18:26.734 --> 00:18:30.905
Well, a guy was cleaning
a gun and...it went off.

282
00:18:30.972 --> 00:18:32.239
Oh, nonsense.

283
00:18:32.306 --> 00:18:34.476
Well, that's my story,
and a couple of cops

284
00:18:34.542 --> 00:18:36.711
with rubber hoses
can't make me change it.

285
00:18:38.179 --> 00:18:39.747
Oh.

286
00:18:42.584 --> 00:18:46.220
Where was this man
cleaning the gun?

287
00:18:46.287 --> 00:18:47.655
In a limousine.

288
00:18:47.722 --> 00:18:51.426
It hit a bump
and the gun went off.

289
00:18:51.493 --> 00:18:53.428
Why did they wanna get you?

290
00:18:53.495 --> 00:18:55.363
Because I won't buy
their bum alcohol.

291
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:57.264
I don't poison people.

292
00:18:57.331 --> 00:19:00.535
Why don't you tell who these men
are and have them arrested?

293
00:19:00.602 --> 00:19:02.370
For the same reason
you don't squeal

294
00:19:02.437 --> 00:19:05.339
about half the raw work
you see down here.

295
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:10.712
What do you mean?

296
00:19:10.778 --> 00:19:13.415
Well...do you?

297
00:19:14.616 --> 00:19:17.852
Why, we have
professional ethics.

298
00:19:17.919 --> 00:19:21.088
Yeah? That goes
for my line too.

299
00:19:23.491 --> 00:19:25.059
The things my profession
keep quiet about

300
00:19:25.126 --> 00:19:27.294
we believe it's for
the public's own good.

301
00:19:27.361 --> 00:19:29.697
Yeah? Ditto.

302
00:19:35.403 --> 00:19:38.773
Well, it's gone clear through.
You've lost a lot of blood.

303
00:19:42.009 --> 00:19:43.478
What's up?

304
00:19:45.747 --> 00:19:47.314
Say, that's a bullet wound.

305
00:19:47.381 --> 00:19:50.384
Hey, nobody sent for you. Go
rustle your hot water bottles.

306
00:19:50.452 --> 00:19:53.888
This is no hot water bottle.

307
00:19:53.955 --> 00:19:55.957
Did you get this bird's
name and address?

308
00:19:56.023 --> 00:19:57.892
Oh, I don't think
that's necessary.

309
00:19:57.959 --> 00:20:00.962
Don't you know, you're supposed
to report all bullet wounds?

310
00:20:01.028 --> 00:20:03.431
You didn't see
any bullet wound.

311
00:20:03.498 --> 00:20:05.132
I didn't?

312
00:20:05.199 --> 00:20:08.770
Say, what's the idea?
Friend of yours?

313
00:20:11.272 --> 00:20:12.707
Thanks, pal.

314
00:20:12.774 --> 00:20:15.977
He have to be plenty hot before
I take a chance like that.

315
00:20:16.043 --> 00:20:18.212
- You said something, sister?
- Hold quiet, will you?

316
00:20:18.279 --> 00:20:19.614
Okay.

317
00:20:21.783 --> 00:20:23.551
Hey, are you really
taking a chance?

318
00:20:23.618 --> 00:20:25.219
I'll say she is.

319
00:20:25.286 --> 00:20:28.890
All a nurse needs to do is get
into one jam and she's through.

320
00:20:28.956 --> 00:20:30.992
- 'Yeah?'
- Oh, don't talk so much.

321
00:20:31.058 --> 00:20:33.661
You might as well turn in
your uniform and quit.

322
00:20:33.728 --> 00:20:36.531
Maybe 56 bucks a week
isn't much, but it's 56 bucks.

323
00:20:36.598 --> 00:20:38.399
Hey, is that all
they pay you?

324
00:20:38.466 --> 00:20:40.134
It's better than
selling apples.

325
00:20:40.201 --> 00:20:43.204
That's probably what she'll be
doing if she loses her diploma.

326
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.006
Shh.

327
00:20:45.072 --> 00:20:49.043
There you are. It's a nasty cut,
but it'll be alright now.

328
00:20:55.783 --> 00:20:58.119
- Dump this.
- Thanks, sister.

329
00:20:59.987 --> 00:21:01.589
My pal.

330
00:21:04.526 --> 00:21:06.193
(Eagan)
'What's his trouble?'

331
00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.229
(Lora)
'He fell downstairs
and cut his shoulder.'

332
00:21:08.295 --> 00:21:10.665
(Eagan)
'Walks like he'd lost
a lot of blood.'

333
00:21:10.732 --> 00:21:12.867
(Lora)
'No. Just drunk.'

334
00:21:14.602 --> 00:21:16.170
(Eagan)
'Oh.'

335
00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:26.781
Hey, Maloney, don't forget
to wash that bedpan.

336
00:21:28.082 --> 00:21:30.017
'And make it shiny.'

337
00:21:31.553 --> 00:21:33.555
Yes, do that.

338
00:21:37.358 --> 00:21:38.826
[clears throat]

339
00:21:41.495 --> 00:21:43.598
[bell ringing]

340
00:21:47.201 --> 00:21:49.070
Oh, calm down, Lora.

341
00:21:51.272 --> 00:21:53.875
You've seen blood before,
just because this is your first

342
00:21:53.941 --> 00:21:55.910
big operation,
don't make it any worse.

343
00:21:55.977 --> 00:21:57.344
Oh, I know--

344
00:21:57.411 --> 00:22:00.615
If you get dizzy or feel faint
keep an eye on me.

345
00:22:00.682 --> 00:22:02.249
Remember, this
is the final test

346
00:22:02.316 --> 00:22:05.553
and if you pass out
this time, you don't graduate.

347
00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.521
Okay.

348
00:22:07.589 --> 00:22:09.791
Wait a minute.

349
00:22:09.857 --> 00:22:11.793
I almost forgot this.

350
00:22:11.859 --> 00:22:15.663
A man left this here, he said
it was to be given to you before

351
00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:18.232
you went in to your big test.

352
00:22:20.167 --> 00:22:22.870
He seemed to think
you'd know who he was.

353
00:22:43.791 --> 00:22:46.728
- Well, of all--
- That's what I call a pal.

354
00:22:46.794 --> 00:22:49.196
- What'll I do with it?
- Put it away for her.

355
00:22:49.263 --> 00:22:53.167
But you're not allowed to drink.
What's it good for?

356
00:22:53.234 --> 00:22:54.802
It's swell for
cleaning teeth.

359
00:23:31.438 --> 00:23:36.043
Boy, are we lucky to get in on
an operation as big as this.

360
00:23:37.444 --> 00:23:39.814
Well, I hope Dr. Bell
gets away with it.

361
00:23:39.881 --> 00:23:42.016
He's got one chance
in a hundred.

00:25:11.973 --> 00:25:13.274
Does that happen often?

367
00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.377
No, but when it does,
it's bad news.

368
00:25:16.443 --> 00:25:18.946
It's horrible.

369
00:25:19.013 --> 00:25:22.183
Well, come on. Let's get outta
here. My teeth need cleaning.

How did you wangle me
into this job?

Told Svengali the kids
knew you at the hospital

401
00:27:38.785 --> 00:27:40.154
and were crazy about you.

402
00:27:40.221 --> 00:27:42.623
- Thanks, who's Svengali.
- Dr. Ranger.

403
00:27:42.689 --> 00:27:46.127
He's a new one, not on any
hospital staff that I know of

404
00:27:46.193 --> 00:27:48.062
but he sure
the boss around here.

405
00:27:48.129 --> 00:27:50.564
Why did they take
Dr. Bell off the case?

406
00:27:50.631 --> 00:27:52.199
That's what I like to know.

407
00:27:52.266 --> 00:27:54.268
Certainly seems funny to me

408
00:27:54.335 --> 00:27:58.039
replacing a man like
Dr. Bell with an unknown.

409
00:27:58.105 --> 00:28:00.007
Lora, there's something
screwy about this case.

410
00:28:00.074 --> 00:28:01.475
What do you mean?

411
00:28:01.542 --> 00:28:03.911
Ever since those kids
got back from the hospital

412
00:28:03.978 --> 00:28:06.147
they've been living on nothing,
but a little milk.

413
00:28:06.213 --> 00:28:08.182
That's no cure for anemia
or malnutrition either.

414
00:28:08.249 --> 00:28:11.018
- I'll say, it isn't.
- They were doing alright.

415
00:28:11.085 --> 00:28:12.853
Dr. Bell said they were
getting along great.

416
00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.622
- And aren't they improving now?
- No, they're getting worse.

417
00:28:15.689 --> 00:28:19.493
- I'm beginning to wonder why.
- But why should anyone..

418

Oh, you're crazy.

419
00:28:21.362 --> 00:28:24.231
Maybe, I don't know a thing,
I just work here.

420
00:28:25.366 --> 00:28:27.634
Anymore instructions,
Miss Maloney?

421
00:28:27.701 --> 00:28:29.036
No, Miss Hart.

422
00:28:29.103 --> 00:28:31.072
There's a chart pinned up
in the kitchenette

423
00:28:31.138 --> 00:28:32.373
beyond the children's room.

424
00:28:32.439 --> 00:28:34.008
- Kitchenette?
- Yeah.

425

I'd say, keep your
eye open for old eczema.

428
00:28:47.421 --> 00:28:50.357
- Who?
- Mrs. Maxwell, the housekeeper.

429
00:28:50.424 --> 00:28:53.827
Wait, till you see her. Well,
so long, honey, I got a date.

430
00:28:53.894 --> 00:28:55.262

431
00:28:55.329 --> 00:28:57.731
Oh, you don't know him,
a gorgeous new boyfriend.

I'm not all crazy.

435
00:29:06.807 --> 00:29:08.309
Children, what are you doing?

436
00:29:08.375 --> 00:29:11.045
We're having fun.
We're having fun.

437
00:29:14.148 --> 00:29:16.550
Stop it, lie down,
both of you.

438
00:29:21.488 --> 00:29:24.058
Nanny, you silly little girl,
you shouldn't try things

439
00:29:24.125 --> 00:29:25.959
like that, you're
not strong enough.

440
00:29:26.027 --> 00:29:29.063
I tried all I could, Desney.

441
00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:31.365
Of course you did, Nanny.

442
00:29:34.468 --> 00:29:36.037
Little baby.

443
00:29:41.042 --> 00:29:43.277
I didn't mean any harm.

444
00:29:43.344 --> 00:29:47.048
I know you didn't, Desney.
But now, you must both be quiet.

445
00:29:47.114 --> 00:29:49.716
We will. Won't we, Nanny?

446
00:29:49.783 --> 00:29:52.719
- Yes, we will.
- That's good.

447
00:29:52.786 --> 00:29:54.821
We like you.

448
00:29:54.888 --> 00:29:57.191
- Don't we, Nanny?
- Hm-mm.

449
00:29:57.258 --> 00:30:01.162
What's your other name? You
didn't tell us at the hospital.

450
00:30:01.228 --> 00:30:04.398
- It's Lora, Lora Hart.
- Lora!

451
00:30:04.465 --> 00:30:07.401
- We had a sister named Lora.
- But she is dead.

452
00:30:08.969 --> 00:30:10.904
Oh, poor little baby.

453
00:30:10.971 --> 00:30:12.906
You mustn't talk
about her anymore.

454
00:30:12.973 --> 00:30:15.509
She was runned over.
She was all cut.

455
00:30:15.576 --> 00:30:18.979
Cut in lots of places.
Wasn't she, Nanny?

456
00:30:19.046 --> 00:30:23.284
All over here
and here and here.

457
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:25.952
Oh, you ought have seen her.

458
00:30:26.019 --> 00:30:27.621
You mustn't think
about her anymore.

459
00:30:27.688 --> 00:30:29.856
You must go to sleep,
both of you.

460
00:30:29.923 --> 00:30:32.393
We didn't see her,
but they told us.

461
00:30:32.459 --> 00:30:35.296
Nick, told us.
And he showed us too.

462
00:30:35.362 --> 00:30:37.464
- Who's Nick?
- He lives here.

463
00:30:37.531 --> 00:30:40.134
- That's not your father, is it?
- No.

464
00:30:40.201 --> 00:30:42.936
Daddy is up in heaven too.

465
00:30:43.003 --> 00:30:46.340
Oh, I'm sorry.

466
00:30:46.407 --> 00:30:48.875
Now, come on,
both of you into bed.

467
00:30:48.942 --> 00:30:53.046
Nick's not like daddy.
Daddy was a nice man.

468
00:30:53.114 --> 00:30:55.116
Isn't Nick a nice man?

469
00:30:55.182 --> 00:30:58.385
No, he's a horrid man.
Isn't he, Nanny?

470
00:31:00.087 --> 00:31:03.124
Oh, Nanny darlin',
don't cry, honey.

471
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:06.493
Such a nice home,
lovely things

472
00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.662
and you're going to
get well real soon.

473
00:31:08.729 --> 00:31:12.399
It isn't a lovely home.
We didn't wanna come home.

474
00:31:12.466 --> 00:31:14.401
- 'Did we, Nanny?'
- 'No.'

475
00:31:14.468 --> 00:31:17.571

doesn't he, Nanny?'

476
00:31:17.638 --> 00:31:19.940
'He says the
most awful things.'

477
00:31:20.006 --> 00:31:21.442
'You should tell your mother.'

478
00:31:21.508 --> 00:31:25.179
We can't. She won't come
and see us anymore.

479
00:31:26.847 --> 00:31:28.415
Why aren't you two asleep?

480
00:31:30.617 --> 00:31:32.553
They shouldn't be
kept awake like this.

481
00:31:32.619 --> 00:31:35.256
I've been trying
to make them go to sleep.

482
00:31:35.322 --> 00:31:37.291
- That's true.
- Then, why didn't you?

483
00:31:37.358 --> 00:31:40.194
We were hungry,
weren't we, Nanny?

484
00:31:40.261 --> 00:31:42.296
Hungry, don't be absurd.

485
00:31:42.363 --> 00:31:45.932
But we are hungry.
We're always hungry.

486
00:31:45.999 --> 00:31:49.370
- I want to speak to you.
- Are you Mrs. Maxwell?

487
00:31:49.436 --> 00:31:52.806
Yes, I have charge
of the children.

488
00:31:52.873 --> 00:31:56.777
I don't want to hear another
word out of you, eitherof you.

489
00:32:02.249 --> 00:32:04.418
I wish we had
something to eat.

490
00:32:04.485 --> 00:32:07.754
Shh! Or else she'll
come back.

491
00:32:07.821 --> 00:32:10.624
Now, Miss Hart, I must
warn you not to be upset

492
00:32:10.691 --> 00:32:12.493
by anything
the children may tell you.

493
00:32:12.559 --> 00:32:14.595
- They've been very sick.
- Yes, I know.

494
00:32:14.661 --> 00:32:17.364
I had charge of them
at the hospital.

495
00:32:17.431 --> 00:32:18.865
Oh!

496
00:32:18.932 --> 00:32:21.735
Since, they've been home they've
had bad dreams, nightmares.

497
00:32:21.802 --> 00:32:24.605
Dr. Ranger says that's
all part of their illness.

498
00:32:24.671 --> 00:32:27.073
But they are too young
to know the difference

499
00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.943
between dreams and facts

500
00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:32.779
you must realize that whenever
they tell you anything.

501
00:32:34.748 --> 00:32:37.284
I see...thank you.

502
00:32:40.153 --> 00:32:43.156

assistance.

00:34:25.926 --> 00:34:28.595
Are you going to be
decent and leave?

518
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:32.966
I've got to undress her.

519
00:34:33.033 --> 00:34:34.635
That's alright.

520
00:34:38.138 --> 00:34:39.873
Just the type.

521
00:34:40.941 --> 00:34:43.744
Huh, what did you say?

522
00:34:45.178 --> 00:34:47.881
[music continues]

523
00:35:01.428 --> 00:35:02.729
Come here.

524
00:35:02.796 --> 00:35:03.797
Cut that out.

525
00:35:05.198 --> 00:35:06.533
Ow!

526
00:35:11.237 --> 00:35:12.406
Leave me alone.

527
00:35:12.473 --> 00:35:15.609
I won't leave you.
I wanna kiss you.

528
00:35:17.478 --> 00:35:20.213
- Oh!
- I wanna kiss.

529
00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.682
(Lora)
'Stop it.'

530
00:35:24.284 --> 00:35:25.919
'Let me alone.'

531
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:32.459
[grunts]

532
00:35:42.536 --> 00:35:44.104
I don't know
how to thank you.

533
00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:46.973
Never mind, get busy with her.
Give her a stomach wash.

534
00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.043
- I'll call a doctor.
- You do what I tell you.

535
00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:52.278
What're you trying to do?
What he did?

536
00:35:52.345 --> 00:35:54.314
No, but you're
not gonna call a doctor

537
00:35:54.381 --> 00:35:56.349
you're a nurse, you'll
give her the wash.

538
00:35:56.417 --> 00:35:58.218
I can't, except
on the doctors orders.

539
00:35:58.284 --> 00:35:59.853
Yes, you can.
What's more, you will.

540
00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:03.490
I can't very well,
with the broken wrist.

541
00:36:10.731 --> 00:36:12.499
Operator, operator,
get me a doctor quick.

542
00:36:12.566 --> 00:36:14.535
Give me that
or I'll break your neck.

543
00:36:14.601 --> 00:36:16.169
- What right have you to?
- Plenty.

544
00:36:16.236 --> 00:36:18.472
- Oh, big boy.
- Ah, shut up.

545
00:36:18.539 --> 00:36:21.274
Oh, don't be sore, Nicky.
Kiss me.

546
00:36:21.341 --> 00:36:22.876
Get busy.

547
00:36:22.943 --> 00:36:24.678
I can't without
the proper authority.

548
00:36:24.745 --> 00:36:26.913
- I'll give you the authority.
- Who are you?

549
00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:29.382
I'm Nick.

550
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:31.017
The chauffeur.

551
00:36:36.156 --> 00:36:39.526
Operator, operator, operator.

552
00:36:40.326 --> 00:36:41.662
Oh.

553
00:36:48.435 --> 00:36:52.038
Don't be sore, big boy,
where you going?

554
00:37:04.585 --> 00:37:06.587
[music continues]

555
00:37:56.269 --> 00:37:57.470
Dirty, lousy..

556
00:38:08.682 --> 00:38:11.084
(Lora)
'I tell you, Dr. Ranger,
I wouldn't go through'

557
00:38:11.151 --> 00:38:14.354
'another night like that for all
the money they could pay me.'

558
00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:15.822
Well, then what?

559
00:38:15.889 --> 00:38:18.692
I locked the doors and windows
and sat up until morning

560
00:38:18.759 --> 00:38:20.326
expecting that
brute to come back.

561
00:38:20.393 --> 00:38:21.828
- Well, did he?
- No, but--

562
00:38:21.895 --> 00:38:23.664
I see, it's been
unfortunate, Miss Hart

563
00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:25.699
but there's no likelihood
of it happening again.

564
00:38:25.766 --> 00:38:27.534
I'm gonna make sure
it doesn't happen.

565
00:38:27.601 --> 00:38:29.202
- Forget it.
- I'm going to the police.

566
00:38:29.269 --> 00:38:31.037
- What'll that get you?
- You don't suppose--

567
00:38:31.104 --> 00:38:33.073
- Who'd believe you?
- Believe me?

568
00:38:33.139 --> 00:38:35.308
Ritcheys wouldn't let you
get away with a racket.

569
00:38:35.375 --> 00:38:37.343
Blackmail's a pretty
dangerous game, Miss Hart.

570
00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:38.779
- Blackmail?
- You heard me.

571
00:38:38.845 --> 00:38:40.914
Well, then-then
you don't believe me?

572
00:38:40.981 --> 00:38:42.549
- Why should I?
- But, Dr. Ranger--

573
00:38:42.616 --> 00:38:44.184
I visited the house
daily for months

574
00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:46.620
and I see no evidence
of all this rot.

575
00:38:46.687 --> 00:38:48.889
Yes, you have.
You know you have.

576
00:38:48.955 --> 00:38:50.724
I thought you were
a reputable physician

577
00:38:50.791 --> 00:38:52.358
I came here
to ask your advice--

578
00:38:52.425 --> 00:38:54.595
Then you'll have it,
mind your own business.

579
00:38:54.661 --> 00:38:56.096
You're there
to watch two patients.

580
00:38:56.162 --> 00:38:58.531
Not to oversee the private
conduct of its members.

581
00:38:58.599 --> 00:39:00.767
Am I supposed to
take blows from a servant?

582
00:39:00.834 --> 00:39:02.402
I've said that
wouldn't happen again.

583
00:39:02.468 --> 00:39:03.837
You're willing
to guarantee that?

584
00:39:03.904 --> 00:39:06.406
You've forgotten your
place long enough.

585
00:39:06.472 --> 00:39:09.242
Just quiet down, now. I'll see
that you're fully compensated.

586
00:39:09.309 --> 00:39:10.677
- Is that all?
- No, it isn't.

587
00:39:10.744 --> 00:39:12.512
Something's gotta be done
about those kids.

588
00:39:12.579 --> 00:39:13.814
You're speaking
of my patients?

589
00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.849
I can't help it
if you're the doctor.

590
00:39:15.916 --> 00:39:18.484
The way things are, those babies
won't last another month.

591
00:39:18.551 --> 00:39:19.986
Well, that's news to me.

592
00:39:20.053 --> 00:39:22.388
Dr. Ranger, they're slowly
dying of undernourishment.

593
00:39:22.455 --> 00:39:24.390
Aren't my feeding
instructions being followed?

594
00:39:24.457 --> 00:39:26.760
I suppose so, here.

595
00:39:29.162 --> 00:39:33.834
Let's see about..
Quite correct.

596
00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.737
But I know starvation
symptoms when I see them.

597
00:39:36.803 --> 00:39:38.805
- Well, if you don't approve--
- No, I don't.

598
00:39:38.872 --> 00:39:40.306
It's your first case,
isn't it?

599
00:39:40.373 --> 00:39:42.575
- 'Well, what of it?'
- You been on one night.

600
00:39:42.643 --> 00:39:45.245
I suppose, it's only natural
that you should get excited

601
00:39:45.311 --> 00:39:47.781
about something
that puzzles you.

602
00:39:47.848 --> 00:39:49.816
You know, Miss Hart,
you talk too much.

603
00:39:49.883 --> 00:39:51.785
You've picked up
a lot of half-baked

604
00:39:51.852 --> 00:39:55.055
medical knowledge around
the hospital. All nurses do.

605
00:39:55.121 --> 00:39:57.557
I wouldn't err so freely,
or you'll talk yourself

606
00:39:57.624 --> 00:39:59.425
out of your profession
in short order.

607
00:39:59.492 --> 00:40:00.861
Don't think you
can muzzle me.

608
00:40:00.927 --> 00:40:02.595
I'm not trying
to muzzle you.

609
00:40:02.663 --> 00:40:05.031
If you don't want it,
get off the case.

610
00:40:05.098 --> 00:40:06.499
Alright, I resign.

611
00:40:06.566 --> 00:40:09.402
If you do, you're through
with the license, nurse.

612
00:40:09.469 --> 00:40:11.071
- Oh, a threat?
- Exactly.

613
00:40:11.137 --> 00:40:12.939
Your kind is
too dangerous.

614
00:40:13.006 --> 00:40:15.575
I have no doubt of it
to your kind of doctor.

615
00:40:15.642 --> 00:40:18.712
But I'm gonna find someone
who will listen to me.

616
00:40:25.185 --> 00:40:28.121
Riverside, 12468.

617
00:40:29.622 --> 00:40:31.491
Hello.

618
00:40:31.557 --> 00:40:32.759
Huh..

619
00:40:32.826 --> 00:40:35.428
Hello, Nick, this
is Dr. Ranger.

620
00:40:35.495 --> 00:40:38.965
Now, listen carefully and I'll
tell you what I want you to do.

621
00:40:39.032 --> 00:40:40.967
'I know it's
my first case'

622
00:40:41.034 --> 00:40:44.037
'I know Dr. Ranger's a big man,
but I've gotta do something.'

623
00:40:44.104 --> 00:40:46.873
'You got me the job,
that's why I came to you.'

624
00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:48.008
But my dear child--

625
00:40:48.074 --> 00:40:50.010
I'm sorry to
drag you into this

626
00:40:50.076 --> 00:40:53.279
but those kids are starving,
you can see it in their faces.

627
00:40:53.346 --> 00:40:55.716
If somebody doesn't something,
they won't last another month.

628
00:40:55.782 --> 00:40:57.751
Don't get so
worked up about it.

629
00:40:57.818 --> 00:41:00.186
Don't you think I know
starvation symptoms?

630
00:41:00.253 --> 00:41:03.289
- Yes, I suppose you do.
- Then, won't you do something?

631
00:41:03.356 --> 00:41:06.126
Lora, you know I can't interfere
in an other doctor's case.

632
00:41:06.192 --> 00:41:08.561
Why can't you, when things
like this are going on?

633
00:41:08.628 --> 00:41:12.098
- It's about as unethical--
- Oh, ethics, ethics, ethics.

634
00:41:12.165 --> 00:41:14.735
That's all I've heard since
I've been in this business.

635
00:41:14.801 --> 00:41:16.336
Isn't there any
humanity in it?

636
00:41:16.402 --> 00:41:18.972
Or is there any ethics about
letting babies be murdered?

637
00:41:19.039 --> 00:41:21.407
'Steady, Lora. You need proof
when you talk that way.'

638
00:41:21.474 --> 00:41:24.244
What more proof do I need
than what I've already got.

639
00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:26.379
But, why don't you
cool down a bit?

640
00:41:26.446 --> 00:41:29.082
Those kids were getting along
alright when you had them.

641
00:41:29.149 --> 00:41:31.084
Why were you
taken off the case?

642
00:41:31.151 --> 00:41:33.820
- Frankly, I don't know.
- You know he's rotten.

643
00:41:33.887 --> 00:41:35.155
I can't discuss that.

644
00:41:35.221 --> 00:41:37.323
No, because it isn't
ethical. Well, I can.

645
00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:39.359
Why doesn't he belong
to the medical association?

646
00:41:39.425 --> 00:41:42.195
Why hasn't he got some job
and some decent hospital staff?

647
00:41:42.262 --> 00:41:46.066
Because he's shady. You know it
as well as every other doctor.

648
00:41:46.132 --> 00:41:48.501
I know a lot of things
inside the profession

649
00:41:48.568 --> 00:41:50.971
that I can't advertise.

650
00:41:51.037 --> 00:41:53.840
I also know that Dr. Ranger
has a tremendous practice

651
00:41:53.907 --> 00:41:56.142
and that alone can
keep him out of trouble.

652
00:41:56.209 --> 00:42:00.046
If I stir things up, what
does it look like? Jealousy.

653
00:42:00.113 --> 00:42:01.882
Alright, argue yourself
out of your responsibilities.

654
00:42:01.948 --> 00:42:03.316
I'll see this thing
through myself.

655
00:42:03.383 --> 00:42:05.218
- Will you be reasonable?
- No.

656
00:42:05.285 --> 00:42:08.688
I won't see this thing go on any
longer. I'm going to the police.

657
00:42:08.755 --> 00:42:11.124
'Lora, don't you realize
they'll only laugh at you?'

658
00:42:11.191 --> 00:42:13.159
You, a nurse
on her first job

659
00:42:13.226 --> 00:42:15.996
trying to pitch your opinion
against a man like Dr. Ranger.

660
00:42:16.062 --> 00:42:17.764
Oh, what'll I do?
It's maddening.

661
00:42:17.831 --> 00:42:19.265
Two little babies
being murdered.

662
00:42:19.332 --> 00:42:22.102
I feel like I could go
yell it on the street.

663
00:42:22.168 --> 00:42:25.205
You've got to convince people
that what you say is true.

664
00:42:25.271 --> 00:42:27.507
- How?
- Hysterics won't do it.

665
00:42:27.573 --> 00:42:30.510
It'll calm down if you'll
only tell me what to do.

666
00:42:30.576 --> 00:42:33.413
My advise is for you
to go back on that job.

667
00:42:33.479 --> 00:42:35.882
If you're convinced
of malpractice

668
00:42:35.949 --> 00:42:37.583
you can do more good there

669
00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:40.020
than you can shouting
around on the outside.

670
00:42:40.086 --> 00:42:42.688
Go back and
watch those kids.

671
00:42:42.755 --> 00:42:46.159
We've got to play Ranger
at his own game.

672
00:42:46.226 --> 00:42:50.363
It's a risky business and
it's right under Ranger's nose.

673
00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:52.999
But if he wants to
murder those youngsters

674
00:42:53.066 --> 00:42:55.535
we will make
him use a gun.

675
00:42:55.601 --> 00:42:59.806
I came to apologize for
the way I acted this morning.

676
00:42:59.873 --> 00:43:02.075
So, you've
thought it over, hmm?

677
00:43:02.142 --> 00:43:04.177
Yes, I'm terribly sorry.

678
00:43:04.244 --> 00:43:07.113
I hadn't gotten over
the shock of last night.

679
00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:11.717
I didn't realize what I was
saying, I hope you'll overlook.

680
00:43:11.784 --> 00:43:13.719
Who're you talking to?

681
00:43:13.786 --> 00:43:17.090
Why, I...I didn't
discuss it with anyone.

682
00:43:17.157 --> 00:43:19.525
I just sat in the park
and thought things over.

683
00:43:19.592 --> 00:43:22.762
I realized I was simply
throwing my career away.

684
00:43:22.829 --> 00:43:24.965
And I can't do that.

685
00:43:26.132 --> 00:43:28.101
I thought you
would come around.

686
00:43:28.168 --> 00:43:30.470
You're not the first
hysterical nurse I've seen.

687
00:43:30.536 --> 00:43:31.804
You'll forgive me then?

688
00:43:31.872 --> 00:43:36.676
Entirely forgotten,
on both sides.

689
00:43:36.742 --> 00:43:38.411
That little business
of last night.

690
00:43:38.478 --> 00:43:40.013
Oh, yes, of course.

691
00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.814
I understand that
such occurrences

692
00:43:41.882 --> 00:43:43.816
are all part of
a nurse's experience.

693
00:43:43.884 --> 00:43:46.119
'That's it, exactly.'

694
00:43:46.186 --> 00:43:49.622
Let me give you little
friendly advise, my dear.

695
00:43:49.689 --> 00:43:53.994
A successful nurse is the one
who keeps her mouth shut.

696
00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:56.029
You see, we doctors
have to do it.

697
00:43:56.096 --> 00:43:58.264
It's part of our
professional ethics.

698
00:43:58.331 --> 00:44:00.100
So naturally,
we want nurses

699
00:44:00.166 --> 00:44:02.302
whose discretion
we can rely upon.

700
00:44:02.368 --> 00:44:04.437
I realized that now.

701
00:44:04.504 --> 00:44:05.605
Good.

702
00:44:05.671 --> 00:44:08.041
Come on, run along now,
back to your case.

703
00:44:08.108 --> 00:44:10.076
Make sure everything's
going to be very pleasant.

704
00:44:10.143 --> 00:44:12.212
You're generous
to keep me on.

705
00:44:12.278 --> 00:44:15.315
Since, we understand
each other, Miss Hart

706
00:44:15.381 --> 00:44:18.051
I shall probably have
considerable work for you.

707
00:44:18.118 --> 00:44:21.454
- Oh, do you think so?
- I like your spirit.

708
00:44:21.521 --> 00:44:24.524
Just put it to use in the
interest of your doctor.

709
00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:27.093
- Can you?
- I think I can.

710
00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.861
Good afternoon,
doctor.

711
00:44:28.929 --> 00:44:31.397
Good afternoon,
Miss Hart.

712
00:44:34.534 --> 00:44:35.801
How do you do?

713
00:44:35.868 --> 00:44:37.837
I was told,
you wish to see me.

714
00:44:37.904 --> 00:44:41.074
Oh, yes, I have wanted
to talk with you, but..

715
00:44:41.141 --> 00:44:42.808
Oh, my head hurts so..

716
00:44:42.875 --> 00:44:45.445
I hope it feels
better now.

717
00:44:45.511 --> 00:44:50.050
No, if people only knew
that tortures of nurse Dania

718
00:44:50.116 --> 00:44:52.518
they'd forgive us
everything.

719
00:44:52.585 --> 00:44:56.389
You see, Dr. Ranger forgot
to send my bromides.

720
00:44:56.456 --> 00:44:57.757
Oh.

721
00:44:57.823 --> 00:45:01.427
I do hope you were, too, upset
by the conduct of the chauffeur.

722
00:45:01.494 --> 00:45:05.098
You know.. Now, listen,
Bruchie. Stop that.

723
00:45:05.165 --> 00:45:08.134
You know, we discovered,
for some strange reason

724
00:45:08.201 --> 00:45:10.270
that Nick seems
to irritate me

725
00:45:10.336 --> 00:45:12.838
less than any
of the other servants.

726
00:45:12.905 --> 00:45:16.242
So, uh, as far
as feasible

727
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:19.879
Dr. Ranger wanted him to
be my personal attendant.

728
00:45:19.946 --> 00:45:21.714
Well, we'll just
forget about it.

729
00:45:21.781 --> 00:45:26.119
I'm sure you understand
how much I'm depending upon you.

730
00:45:26.186 --> 00:45:28.554
I'll do everything I can
to help the children.

731
00:45:28.621 --> 00:45:30.023
Is that all?

732
00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:32.458
Oh, I want you to
have this, Miss Hart.

733
00:45:32.525 --> 00:45:33.626
Why, I--

734
00:45:33.693 --> 00:45:36.929
Just a little appreciation
of your tactful conduct.

735
00:45:36.997 --> 00:45:39.632
Oh, thank you very much.
Is that all?

736
00:45:39.699 --> 00:45:42.635
I'll be sending
for you soon.

737
00:45:51.944 --> 00:45:55.081
[indistinct murmuring]

738
00:46:01.821 --> 00:46:03.656
Now, what did she want?

739
00:46:03.723 --> 00:46:06.092
- Gee, a hundred bucks!
- Yeah, isn't that a scream?

740
00:46:06.159 --> 00:46:08.094
Hey, don't handle it
like it's rubber.

741
00:46:08.161 --> 00:46:10.930
Well, I won't get very much
kick out of spending it.

742
00:46:10.997 --> 00:46:12.398
Listen, Bell,
for a hundred bucks

743
00:46:12.465 --> 00:46:14.634
I'd take a couple of
socks on the chin.

744
00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:16.869
Funny, what people think
money will do, isn't it?

745
00:46:16.936 --> 00:46:19.305
Yeah, keeping our nose out
of patients private affairs

746
00:46:19.372 --> 00:46:21.041
is part of our
professional ethics.

747
00:46:21.107 --> 00:46:23.509
I'll kill the next one
that says "ethics" to me.

748
00:46:23.576 --> 00:46:26.712
- Says you.
- Says me in a big way.

749
00:46:33.953 --> 00:46:37.257
- Make this is up for me please?
- For the little girls, yeah?

750
00:46:37.323 --> 00:46:39.792
- Are they any better?
- I wish I thought so.

751
00:46:39.859 --> 00:46:42.262
My pal.

752
00:46:42.328 --> 00:46:46.132
Well, of all the places.
And drinking a soda too.

753
00:46:46.199 --> 00:46:49.869
- Why not? Have one.
- Why not?

754
00:46:49.935 --> 00:46:53.273
- One of the same.
- Yes, sir.

755
00:46:53.339 --> 00:46:56.709
How's your, uh,
how's your front hand?

756
00:46:56.776 --> 00:46:58.544
Oh, fine.

757
00:46:58.611 --> 00:47:00.413
Good as new.

758
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.048
Hey, you're looking
pretty hot yourself.

759
00:47:02.115 --> 00:47:04.117
Thanks.

760
00:47:11.291 --> 00:47:13.759
Hey, where
did you get that?

761
00:47:15.195 --> 00:47:17.163
Looks like somebody
took a swing at you.

762
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:20.032
Oh, a chauffeur at the place
where I work got fresh.

763
00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.402
He socked you?
On a level?

764
00:47:22.468 --> 00:47:24.837
Well, not exactly
on the level.

765
00:47:24.904 --> 00:47:27.407
From a way down here
someplace.

766
00:47:27.473 --> 00:47:29.609
Why, that dirty.
I'll get him.

767
00:47:29.675 --> 00:47:31.010
What do you mean?

768
00:47:31.077 --> 00:47:34.514
Listen, I know a couple of guys
who'll do it as a pleasure.

769
00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:36.582
You wouldn't do
anything like that.

770
00:47:36.649 --> 00:47:37.883
I don't do a thing

771
00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:40.720
but tell a couple of guys,
"I don't like this bozo."

772
00:47:40.786 --> 00:47:42.888
Anyhow, you
don't know who he is.

773
00:47:42.955 --> 00:47:44.724
You just have to
tell me who is.

774
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:48.594
I should say not. I don't want
you getting in a jam over me.

775
00:47:48.661 --> 00:47:51.497
There's nobody other
to get into a jam over.

776
00:47:51.564 --> 00:47:55.368
Well, maybe there's nobody
I'd rather keep out of a jam.

777
00:47:55.435 --> 00:47:57.303
- Honest?
- Maybe.

778
00:47:57.370 --> 00:48:00.373
Gee, I tried to get you
at the hospital a hundred times.

779
00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.575
- Oh, I'm on private duty now.
- Nights?

780
00:48:02.642 --> 00:48:04.944
Then, how about a buggy ride
some afternoon.

781
00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:07.046
Nurses have reputation.

782
00:48:07.113 --> 00:48:09.349
Oh, I see.

783
00:48:09.415 --> 00:48:13.018
What would you say if I told you
I had had quit the racket?

784
00:48:13.085 --> 00:48:14.887
I'd say I didn't
believe you.

785
00:48:14.954 --> 00:48:17.323
Well, I did,
a month ago.

786
00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:19.159
So, how about a ride
some afternoon?

787
00:48:19.225 --> 00:48:21.127
Tomorrow afternoon.

788
00:48:21.194 --> 00:48:23.629
Well, I'd like too,
but hadn't better.

789
00:48:23.696 --> 00:48:26.932
Come on, I have been crazy to
see you ever since that night.

790
00:48:26.999 --> 00:48:29.369
Listen, when I go riding,
it isn't gonna be

791
00:48:29.435 --> 00:48:31.271
with anybody that's
liable to get shot.

792
00:48:31.337 --> 00:48:33.306
But I tell you
I'm all washed up.

793
00:48:33.373 --> 00:48:35.341
And I tell you
I don't believe you.

794
00:48:35.408 --> 00:48:37.510
On a level, sister.

795
00:48:37.577 --> 00:48:40.980
Hey, you, those two mugs
won't wait forever.

796
00:48:41.046 --> 00:48:43.416
Okay, I'm coming.

797
00:48:43.483 --> 00:48:45.451
Hey, we-we just going
to see the fights.

798
00:48:45.518 --> 00:48:48.254
- Mm-hmm?
- Honest.

799
00:48:48.321 --> 00:48:50.990
I'll find you sometime
and prove 'em on the level.

800
00:48:51.056 --> 00:48:53.193
So long, sister.

801
00:48:58.264 --> 00:49:01.401
[ballroom music]

802
00:49:12.545 --> 00:49:14.747
- How is she?
- She dozed off at last.

803
00:49:14.814 --> 00:49:16.316
Oh, thank goodness.

804
00:49:16.382 --> 00:49:18.618
'Hey, when did you take
to worrying so much?'

805
00:49:18.684 --> 00:49:21.254
I didn't realize
it was so serious.

806
00:49:21.321 --> 00:49:25.057
It's sort of gotten
on my nerves lately.

807
00:49:25.124 --> 00:49:27.159
It's about time.

808
00:49:27.227 --> 00:49:28.628
And..

809
00:49:28.694 --> 00:49:31.063
And I heard something yesterday
that I didn't like.

810
00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:32.732
What?

811
00:49:32.798 --> 00:49:37.570
Well...I'll tell you about it
when I'm sure it's true.

812
00:49:37.637 --> 00:49:42.675
Lora's late again. She would be
every time I got a decent date.

813
00:49:42.742 --> 00:49:45.945
I think I'll blow and let you
watch the kids till she comes.

814
00:49:46.011 --> 00:49:48.581
You mustn't with Nanny
is as low as she is.

815
00:49:48.648 --> 00:49:50.816
I wouldn't know what to do
if anything happens.

816
00:49:50.883 --> 00:49:52.852
Keep your shimmies on,
I didn't mean it.

817
00:49:52.918 --> 00:49:55.288
If she wakes up, we
better try powdered garlic..

818
00:49:55.355 --> 00:49:57.723
A lot good that'll do
if she can't even

819
00:49:57.790 --> 00:49:59.124
retain a morphine drip.

820
00:49:59.191 --> 00:50:02.161
I wish Dr. Ranger would come.
He'd know what to do.

821
00:50:02.228 --> 00:50:04.497
Yeah, he would, alright.

822
00:50:04.564 --> 00:50:06.499
I wish you'd try
a milk bath.

823
00:50:06.566 --> 00:50:08.534
My sister Edna saved
her baby that way.

824
00:50:08.601 --> 00:50:10.570
She did, I tell you,
I was there.

825
00:50:10.636 --> 00:50:12.438
Well, let's not go
into that again.

826
00:50:12.505 --> 00:50:15.541
- But it worked once.
- It was a mistake.

827
00:50:15.608 --> 00:50:18.711
- Well, it's about time.
- Good evening, Mrs. Maxwell.

828
00:50:18.778 --> 00:50:20.012
Where have you been?

829
00:50:20.079 --> 00:50:22.248
That rich boyfriend
of mine is waiting again.

830
00:50:22.315 --> 00:50:25.084
Is that so? I just
saw Eagan downstairs.

831
00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:27.487
He tried to duck,
but I saw him.

832
00:50:27.553 --> 00:50:29.322
I thought he was out
delivering gin

833
00:50:29.389 --> 00:50:30.756
with that bootlegger
crush of yours.

834
00:50:30.823 --> 00:50:32.592
No, I haven't
seen him, but once

835
00:50:32.658 --> 00:50:34.226
since that night
in the drugstore.

836
00:50:34.294 --> 00:50:37.263
Hey, look. Won't
Nanny love that?

837
00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:39.665
Not the way she was
feeling today, she won't.

838
00:50:39.732 --> 00:50:42.635
- Is she worse?
- Yeah, took a nosedive.

839
00:50:42.702 --> 00:50:45.170
I had to send Desney
to Mrs. Maxwell's room.

840
00:50:45.237 --> 00:50:47.139
Nanny can't keep
anything down or up.

841
00:50:47.206 --> 00:50:49.174
Did you try
a morphine drip?

842
00:50:49.241 --> 00:50:51.444
Oh, the poor little baby.

843
00:50:53.045 --> 00:50:55.815
- 'Have you called Dr. Ranger?'
- Yeah, but I can't get him.

844
00:50:55.881 --> 00:50:58.351
He's is in Jersey
on a case.

845
00:50:58.418 --> 00:51:00.586
Well, I've done all I can do
without orders.

846
00:51:00.653 --> 00:51:03.255
You could give her
a milk bath.

847
00:51:03.323 --> 00:51:05.658
My sister saved
her baby with one.

848
00:51:05.725 --> 00:51:07.660
You've got her
start it again.

849
00:51:07.727 --> 00:51:10.129
Well, goodnight, kid.
And good luck.

850
00:51:10.195 --> 00:51:12.365
And if you need me,
give me a ring.

851
00:51:12.432 --> 00:51:14.567
(Lora)
'Alright.'

852
00:51:16.302 --> 00:51:18.170
Why won't you
try a milk bath?

853
00:51:18.237 --> 00:51:21.106
(Lora)
'She couldn't absorb enough
nourishment through her pores.'

854
00:51:21.173 --> 00:51:23.343
But she might.
We could try.

855
00:51:23.409 --> 00:51:27.179
Oh, I didn't realize
it was this serious.

856
00:51:27.246 --> 00:51:29.782
Poor kids. The way
we treated them.

857
00:51:29.849 --> 00:51:32.051
(Lora)
'Sh-h. You will wake her.'

858
00:51:32.117 --> 00:51:33.886
[sobbing]

859
00:51:35.421 --> 00:51:38.358
Nanny.
Nanny.

860
00:51:38.424 --> 00:51:40.893
Look, what
I brought you.

861
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:06.185
Pardon me.

862
00:52:06.251 --> 00:52:08.354
Could you tell me
where Mrs. Ritchey is?

863
00:52:08.421 --> 00:52:12.625
So, what's going on here?
A costume party?

864
00:52:12.692 --> 00:52:14.460
Oh no, wait a minute,
hold on--

865
00:52:14.527 --> 00:52:16.295
Control yourself, big boy,
you don't know her.

866
00:52:16.362 --> 00:52:19.765
Yes, I do. One time I had
a pain and the doctor put

867
00:52:19.832 --> 00:52:23.235
a big cone over my face and
told me to take a deep breath.

868
00:52:23.302 --> 00:52:26.071
'And I did and I ride
right up through the collen'

869
00:52:26.138 --> 00:52:28.908
'and I came up the other end,
there she was.'

870
00:52:30.576 --> 00:52:33.579
[music continues]

871
00:52:35.581 --> 00:52:38.050
- What have we here?
- It's Ms. Iodine herself.

872
00:52:38.117 --> 00:52:40.886
You know where I can find Mrs.
Ritchey? It's very important.

873
00:52:40.953 --> 00:52:43.856
Well, if you're soliciting for
her husband, you're too soon.

874
00:52:43.923 --> 00:52:47.359
Mrs. Ritchey won't
need you till morning.

875
00:52:54.567 --> 00:52:56.436
Do you belong here
in this house?

876
00:52:56.502 --> 00:52:58.471
Yeah, do you know
where Mrs. Ritchey is?

877
00:52:58.538 --> 00:53:00.205
She is the latest
innovation.

878
00:53:00.272 --> 00:53:04.777
All the newest household bars
have attachable sick nurses.

879
00:53:07.547 --> 00:53:10.683
[indistinct chattering]

880
00:53:16.722 --> 00:53:20.125
Mack, go back
and be barkeeper.

881
00:53:20.192 --> 00:53:21.827
Shut up.

882
00:53:21.894 --> 00:53:25.531
Go back and barkeeper.
Gigi wants a drink.

883
00:53:26.732 --> 00:53:28.834
Gigi wants a drink, Mack.

884
00:53:28.901 --> 00:53:32.371
Mrs. Ritchey,
Mrs. Ritchey.

885
00:53:32.438 --> 00:53:34.974
- What?
- I wanna speak to you.

886
00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:39.178
Yeah, go back to the bar
and give Gigi a little drink.

887
00:53:39.244 --> 00:53:42.448
Nanny is very ill. You must
come to the nursery with me.

888
00:53:42.515 --> 00:53:45.585
- What?
- Nanny is dangerously ill.

889
00:53:45.651 --> 00:53:47.286
Are you crazy?

890
00:53:47.352 --> 00:53:49.188
Mrs. Ritchey,
I wouldn't come here

891
00:53:49.254 --> 00:53:50.956
if it wasn't
absolutely necessary.

892
00:53:51.023 --> 00:53:52.257
Don't you understand?

893
00:53:52.324 --> 00:53:56.261
Nanny is almost dying.
It's my duty to make you come.

894
00:53:56.328 --> 00:53:58.163
Ridiculous.

895
00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:00.933
Dr. Ranger is a grand

896
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.070
splendid,
magnificent doctor.

897
00:54:05.137 --> 00:54:10.175
Is a magnificent doctor.
So, she's almost well.

898
00:54:10.242 --> 00:54:11.677
Don't be silly.

899
00:54:11.744 --> 00:54:14.113
Dr. Ranger, hasn't been
near of her for two days.

900
00:54:14.179 --> 00:54:17.950
She's sinking very low.
You've got to come with me.

901
00:54:18.017 --> 00:54:19.552
Sh-h!

902
00:54:19.619 --> 00:54:22.655
I have confidence
in Dr. Ranger.

903
00:54:22.722 --> 00:54:25.390
He's a magnificent doctor.

904
00:54:25.457 --> 00:54:29.161
A marvelous doctor.

905
00:54:29.228 --> 00:54:32.164
[slurring]

906
00:54:38.437 --> 00:54:44.243
I can't see the children because
it makes them so nervous.

907
00:54:46.111 --> 00:54:49.782
Oh, don't you understand?
Nanny is dying.

908
00:54:49.849 --> 00:54:54.554
Oh, go back at the bar
and get Gigi a little drink.

909
00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:56.355
[sobbing]

910
00:54:56.421 --> 00:55:00.225
Mack. Get Gigi
a little drink.

911
00:55:00.292 --> 00:55:02.828
Yes. Yes, I am.

912
00:55:06.398 --> 00:55:08.167
Oh-h.

913
00:55:08.233 --> 00:55:11.236
I remember you.

914
00:55:11.303 --> 00:55:12.772
What you're waving at?

915
00:55:12.838 --> 00:55:15.608
You get out of here,
he's mine.

916
00:55:15.675 --> 00:55:17.509
You get of here.

917
00:55:17.577 --> 00:55:21.747
Dr. Ranger is
a stupendous doctor.

918
00:55:21.814 --> 00:55:25.017
And I love my big boy.

919
00:55:28.153 --> 00:55:32.024
Don't stand there
staring at me like that.

920
00:55:32.091 --> 00:55:36.696
I'm a dipsomaniac and I'm
proud of it. Do you hear?

921
00:55:36.762 --> 00:55:40.065
I'm a dipsomaniac and
I like it, I like it.

922
00:55:40.132 --> 00:55:42.301
- How do you like that?
- You're a cruel mother.

923
00:55:42.367 --> 00:55:45.004
- I'm a dipsomaniac.
- You're a rotten parasite.

924
00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:47.973
That's what you're. Don't blame
it on the booze, it's you.

925
00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:51.644
Why do poor children have
to be born to a woman like you?

926
00:55:51.711 --> 00:55:53.579
- How can I--
- Shut up!

927
00:55:53.646 --> 00:55:55.447
- Mack, don't let her--

928
00:55:55.514 --> 00:55:56.982
You're going up with me

929
00:55:57.049 --> 00:55:59.218
if I have drag you
by your hair.

930
00:55:59.284 --> 00:56:00.552
Let go!

931
00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:02.054
Mack, stop her.

932
00:56:02.121 --> 00:56:03.589
Here, here, here.
Say, what's..

933
00:56:03.656 --> 00:56:05.457
Just a minute, nurse.

934
00:56:05.524 --> 00:56:07.927
Don-don't you realize
that you're getting

935
00:56:07.993 --> 00:56:10.129
poor little Gigi,
all upset?

936
00:56:10.195 --> 00:56:11.831
Oh, yeah?

937
00:56:17.369 --> 00:56:19.071
Say, you can't..

938
00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:30.883
- Come on now.
- Stop it and let go of me.

939
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:35.621
- I say, stop it. Stop.
- Oh, snap out of it.

940
00:56:35.688 --> 00:56:38.323
- Stay on your feet.
- Leave me alone.

941
00:56:44.129 --> 00:56:45.597
You mother.

942
00:56:58.077 --> 00:57:00.312
'Hey, you can't
do that.'

943
00:57:02.347 --> 00:57:03.315
[glass shattering]

944
00:57:12.157 --> 00:57:13.292
Bye-bye.

945
00:57:13.358 --> 00:57:14.994
[laughing]

946
00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:22.902
(Lora)
'Grand 2311.'

947
00:57:24.603 --> 00:57:26.739
Hello, is Dr. Bell there?

948
00:57:28.007 --> 00:57:31.210
Oh. Well, do you know
where I can find him?

949
00:57:31.276 --> 00:57:33.212
I'm Lora Hart, a nurse.

950
00:57:33.278 --> 00:57:35.247
It's very important.

951
00:57:36.115 --> 00:57:38.383
Will he be
at the hospital?

952
00:57:39.819 --> 00:57:41.420
Well, when he does come in

953
00:57:41.486 --> 00:57:44.489
will you tell him Miss Hart
wants him to come at once?

954
00:57:44.556 --> 00:57:47.459
Tell him it's vital
because I can't find Dr. Ranger.

955
00:57:47.526 --> 00:57:48.994
Thank you.

956
00:57:54.233 --> 00:57:56.368
Hey, sister.
Where can I find Nick?

957
00:58:00.405 --> 00:58:01.406
Hello.

958
00:58:03.208 --> 00:58:05.945
- Where'd you come from?
- Well, I'm delivering.

959
00:58:07.346 --> 00:58:09.181
I thought you quit.

960
00:58:09.248 --> 00:58:12.684
Oh, well...I guess
I kinda exaggerated.

961
00:58:14.386 --> 00:58:16.155
Say, you working here?

962
00:58:16.221 --> 00:58:17.222
Yes.

963
00:58:18.924 --> 00:58:21.093
One of my
little patients is dying.

964
00:58:23.028 --> 00:58:25.197
Say, you might help me.

965
00:58:25.264 --> 00:58:27.499
- If I can do anything--
- Come with me.

966
00:58:27.566 --> 00:58:30.770
Say...is this the dump you
got the crack on the chin?

967
00:58:30.836 --> 00:58:32.437
That doesn't matter now.

968
00:58:32.504 --> 00:58:34.639
'Was Nick the guy?'

969
00:58:34.706 --> 00:58:38.343
I've gotta think of this little
child and you've got to help me.

970
00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:39.644
Okay, sister.

971
00:58:39.711 --> 00:58:41.180
Dr. Bell wasn't in.

972
00:58:41.246 --> 00:58:43.215
Oh, what'll we do?
What can we do?

973
00:58:43.282 --> 00:58:45.184
Just wait for Dr. Bell,
that's all.

974
00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:47.987
No use sending for an ambulance.
Nanny couldn't be moved.

975
00:58:48.053 --> 00:58:50.422
- Hey, who is this Bell guy?
- Arthur Bell, the surgeon.

976
00:58:50.489 --> 00:58:53.893
Maybe I can find him. I think
I know a couple of guys--

977
00:58:53.959 --> 00:58:55.527
How could you find him?
Nobody can.

978
00:58:55.594 --> 00:58:58.931
I wish you'd stop acting as
though you knew everything.

979
00:58:58.998 --> 00:59:02.434
- Can't we try a milk bath?
- Oh, that wouldn't do any good.

980
00:59:02.501 --> 00:59:05.337
That's what saved
my sister's baby.

981
00:59:05.404 --> 00:59:07.572
It's a crazy idea,
but we'll try anything.

982
00:59:07.639 --> 00:59:09.041
Oh, thank God.

983
00:59:09.108 --> 00:59:13.278
But I'll need milk.
Ten-twelve-fifteen quarts of it.

984
00:59:13.345 --> 00:59:16.849
- Can you get it?
- Why...where do you buy milk?

985
00:59:16.916 --> 00:59:19.384
- In a grocery, a delicatessens.
- I get you.

986
00:59:19.451 --> 00:59:20.619
Hurry, bootlegger.

987
00:59:20.685 --> 00:59:23.255
This has gotta be the
fastest delivery you ever made.

988
00:59:23.322 --> 00:59:25.490
Okay, sister. I know
a couple of guys--

989
00:59:25.557 --> 00:59:27.259
Alright.

990
01:00:30.822 --> 01:00:33.158
Bootlegger.

991
01:00:33.225 --> 01:00:35.360
(Lora)
'Come in here,
will you?'

992
01:00:41.934 --> 01:00:43.402
Where are you?

993
01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:51.376
Where's he gone?
Where's our bootlegger?

994
01:00:51.443 --> 01:00:54.146
[slurring]
He left 10 minutes ago.

995
01:00:54.213 --> 01:00:58.250
He won't be back. That's
what's wrong with prohibition.

996
01:00:59.418 --> 01:01:02.321
Oh, I wish I could find
one of those doctors.

997
01:01:04.189 --> 01:01:07.559
Don't get Ranger.
I don't like him.

998
01:01:09.094 --> 01:01:11.363
- You don't?
- 'No more.'

999
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:13.298
Why not?

1000
01:01:13.365 --> 01:01:16.936
Had my suspicions
confirmed.

1001
01:01:18.437 --> 01:01:20.372
What suspicions?

1002
01:01:20.973 --> 01:01:22.441
What suspicions?

1003
01:01:23.976 --> 01:01:26.611
I heard on
the telephone..

1004
01:01:26.678 --> 01:01:30.015
What did you hear?
Tell me.

1005
01:01:30.082 --> 01:01:33.953
I heard...what I heard.

1006
01:01:34.019 --> 01:01:35.687
Oh, talk to me.

1007
01:01:35.754 --> 01:01:39.458
What did you hear?
What about Ranger?

1008
01:01:39.524 --> 01:01:43.795
Not talking about him yet.
It isn't time.

1009
01:01:43.862 --> 01:01:46.198
Oh, what is time
if it concerns those kids?

1010
01:01:46.265 --> 01:01:50.902
Will you talk to me?
It's about Nick, isn't it?

1011
01:01:50.970 --> 01:01:54.373
I heard him talking
to Dr. Ranger.

1012
01:01:54.439 --> 01:01:57.276
Alright. You heard him
talking to Dr. Ranger.

1013
01:01:57.342 --> 01:01:59.945
- What did he say?
- T-to Dr. Ranger--

1014
01:02:00.012 --> 01:02:03.048
Oh, will you pay
attention to me?

1015
01:02:03.115 --> 01:02:06.718
What did Nick
say to Dr. Ranger?

1016
01:02:06.785 --> 01:02:11.090
Nick don't want people
to see her when she's drunk.

1017
01:02:12.157 --> 01:02:14.960
Judge will take
away the trust fund.

1018
01:02:15.027 --> 01:02:16.661
Trust fund?

1019
01:02:16.728 --> 01:02:18.463
I had my suspicions.

1020
01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:21.766
Is Mrs. Ritchey in charge
of the children's trust fund?

1021
01:02:21.833 --> 01:02:23.302
Mm-hm.

1022
01:02:26.405 --> 01:02:28.540
So that's what
they're after.

1023
01:02:28.607 --> 01:02:29.574
[door opening]

1024
01:02:33.878 --> 01:02:35.247
What's all the noise?

1025
01:02:37.182 --> 01:02:41.953
Nick, you let us alone.
Nanny's terribly sick.

1026
01:02:42.021 --> 01:02:43.722
Ah, shut up.

1027
01:02:45.657 --> 01:02:47.826
What are you up to
with that kid?

1028
01:02:47.892 --> 01:02:50.329
I'm keeping her resting easily
until the doctor comes.

1029
01:02:50.395 --> 01:02:52.164
Have you anything
to say about that?

1030
01:02:52.231 --> 01:02:53.832
Depends on how
you're doing it.

1031
01:02:53.898 --> 01:02:56.935
- I'm giving her a milk bath.
- Dr. Ranger tell you to?

1032
01:02:57.002 --> 01:03:01.540
No, I can't find Dr. Ranger.
Strange, isn't it?

1033
01:03:01.606 --> 01:03:04.176
Nothing's gonna be done to
that kid without his orders.

1034
01:03:04.243 --> 01:03:05.610
Alright, then you
get Ranger here

1035
01:03:05.677 --> 01:03:08.047
so we can place the
responsibility where it belongs.

1036
01:03:08.113 --> 01:03:09.481
I'm responsible when
he ain't here.

1037
01:03:09.548 --> 01:03:11.516
- I'll say.
- I want his orders carried out.

1038
01:03:11.583 --> 01:03:14.786
You'll be responsible for a lot
more if you don't get wise.

1039
01:03:14.853 --> 01:03:16.121
Oh, yeah?

1040
01:03:16.188 --> 01:03:18.190
They use electric chairs
for the kinda things

1041
01:03:18.257 --> 01:03:19.758
you're responsible for.

1042
01:03:19.824 --> 01:03:21.826
Hey, just what's the idea
behind that crack?

1043
01:03:21.893 --> 01:03:23.862
Don't you think I know
deliberate malpractice

1044
01:03:23.928 --> 01:03:25.297
when I see it?

1045
01:03:25.364 --> 01:03:27.066
You're speaking
right out, ain't you?

1046
01:03:27.132 --> 01:03:28.733
Yeah, I'll make it
even plainer.

1047
01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.503
In your case, I'm
talking about murder.

1048
01:03:31.570 --> 01:03:33.038
Why, you little..

1049
01:03:34.506 --> 01:03:36.208
And I'll keep
your bean.

1050
01:03:36.275 --> 01:03:38.710
If you don't like what
Ranger's doing, talk to him.

1051
01:03:38.777 --> 01:03:42.281
- Don't ring me in.
- You're in already, plenty.

1052
01:03:42.347 --> 01:03:45.150
If this baby dies,
you're in with Ranger.

1053
01:03:46.318 --> 01:03:47.819
Spill it now.
Come on.

1054
01:03:47.886 --> 01:03:50.689
How long did you think
you could get away with this?

1055
01:03:50.755 --> 01:03:53.125
Just because you can
strong-arm a couple of women

1056
01:03:53.192 --> 01:03:55.227
you have the brains
to put this over?

1057
01:03:55.294 --> 01:03:57.862
I had you're number the minute
I stepped into the house.

1058
01:03:57.929 --> 01:04:00.299
What's more, I've reported
my suspicions on the outside.

1059
01:04:00.365 --> 01:04:02.134
Oh, yeah?
Spit them out.

1060
01:04:02.201 --> 01:04:03.968
- You want those kids to die.
- Yeah?

1061
01:04:04.035 --> 01:04:05.637
You want what
their father left them.

1062
01:04:05.704 --> 01:04:08.740
That's why you keep
their mother full of booze.

1063
01:04:08.807 --> 01:04:11.810
You'll take her out and marry
her and grab the trust fund.

1064
01:04:11.876 --> 01:04:14.446
That's what you're after, but
you're not gonna get away.

1065
01:04:14.513 --> 01:04:16.648
Who said there was
a trust fund?

1066
01:04:24.756 --> 01:04:28.560
So you've been shootin' off
you're nutty ideas, huh?

1067
01:04:28.627 --> 01:04:30.129
Get out.

1068
01:04:30.195 --> 01:04:33.432
- Nick, you be careful now.
- Get out.

1069
01:04:38.170 --> 01:04:40.539
I'm not afraid
of you anymore.

1070
01:04:43.175 --> 01:04:44.409
[door closes]

1071
01:04:44.476 --> 01:04:45.844
(Maxwell)
'No, Nick.'

1072
01:04:47.912 --> 01:04:49.013
[Maxwell crying]

1073
01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.549
[door opening]

1074
01:04:52.651 --> 01:04:54.519
Now, I'll tell you
a few things.

1075
01:04:54.586 --> 01:04:57.222
Beating me up won't
get you any place.

1076
01:05:14.306 --> 01:05:17.176
Poor little Nanny.

1077
01:05:17.242 --> 01:05:20.145
Nobody cares whether
you live or die.

1078
01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:24.516
If you could
only hear me.

1079
01:05:24.583 --> 01:05:27.986
I can. And I'm
certainly glad I'm here.

1080
01:05:28.052 --> 01:05:29.688
Doctor, you did
get my message.

1081
01:05:29.754 --> 01:05:32.257
No, I didn't get
any message from you.

1082
01:05:32.324 --> 01:05:34.926
But from a strange man,
a most extraordinary fellow.

1083
01:05:34.993 --> 01:05:36.661
What man?

1084
01:05:36.728 --> 01:05:39.731
He said if I couldn't see
my way clear getting up here

1085
01:05:39.798 --> 01:05:42.367
he'd call around some evening
with a couple of friends

1086
01:05:42.434 --> 01:05:44.403
and take me for a ride.

1087
01:05:44.469 --> 01:05:47.906
- Did he say that?
- Yes, he did.

1088
01:05:47.972 --> 01:05:50.942
And I didn't like the way
he said it, either.

1089
01:05:51.009 --> 01:05:54.779
- Now, what's the trouble here?
- Oh, she's low, doctor.

1090
01:05:54.846 --> 01:05:56.315
Very low.

1091
01:06:01.386 --> 01:06:03.788
Do you think there's
anything we can do?

1092
01:06:03.855 --> 01:06:05.424
Only one thing.

1093
01:06:05.490 --> 01:06:07.459
A blood transfusion,
and in a hurry.

1094
01:06:07.526 --> 01:06:10.028
Take mine, I'm type 4-A.
I've been typed.

1095
01:06:10.094 --> 01:06:11.796
But we don't know
the baby's type.

1096
01:06:11.863 --> 01:06:15.334
I know it, it's 4-A.
Oh, doctor, we've got to hurry.

1097
01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.869
Who's got to hurry?

1098
01:06:19.404 --> 01:06:22.106
- Who are you?
- It's Nick, the chauffeur.

1099
01:06:22.173 --> 01:06:24.175
Oh, yeah.

1100
01:06:27.446 --> 01:06:29.614
I'm Dr. Bell. We're about
to give a transfusion

1101
01:06:29.681 --> 01:06:31.650
and I must ask you
to keep out.

1102
01:06:31.716 --> 01:06:34.219
You're not the doctor
on this case, get out.

1103
01:06:34.286 --> 01:06:36.488
Listen, this is a matter
of life and death.

1104
01:06:36.555 --> 01:06:40.124
- I'd run along if I was you.
- I can't be bothered with you.

1105
01:06:40.191 --> 01:06:42.727
- Oh!
- Oh, you dirty, lousy..

1106
01:06:44.095 --> 01:06:45.330
Oh!

1107
01:06:46.197 --> 01:06:47.666
Hey, you.

1108
01:06:49.601 --> 01:06:53.738
Yeah, I mean you.
Get out of here.

1109
01:07:00.078 --> 01:07:02.547
Come on. And
make it snappy.

1110
01:07:32.176 --> 01:07:35.580
That's a good girl.
Splendid.

1111
01:07:37.816 --> 01:07:41.353
Oh, l...did I wake you?
I'm sorry.

1112
01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:43.622
- How do you feel?
- Alright, I guess.

1113
01:07:43.688 --> 01:07:47.559
- How's Nanny?
- She's responded beautifully.

1114
01:07:49.661 --> 01:07:51.996
She'll pull out
of it this time.

1115
01:07:53.765 --> 01:07:57.369
- Hello, Nanny.
- Hello, Lora.

1116
01:08:03.775 --> 01:08:06.911
'Daylight. My goodness,
have I been asleep that long?'

1117
01:08:06.978 --> 01:08:09.814
Yes, and a good thing too.

1118
01:08:09.881 --> 01:08:12.317
You better go right home
and go back to bed.

1119
01:08:12.384 --> 01:08:15.253
Losing all that blood can make
you feel pretty miserable.

1120
01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:18.189
I can't. I have to hurry
and get dressed.

1121
01:08:18.256 --> 01:08:20.859
- I'm going to the police first.
- Police?

1122
01:08:20.925 --> 01:08:23.995
Can't you see? I've got
all the proof I need now.

1123
01:08:25.797 --> 01:08:28.833
And I'm going
to the bat for you.

1124
01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:32.337
'Gee, doctor,
you're swell.'

1125
01:08:32.404 --> 01:08:35.740
No...just sleepy.

1126
01:08:35.807 --> 01:08:36.808
[chuckling]

1127
01:08:50.355 --> 01:08:51.990
[snoring]

1128
01:08:53.825 --> 01:08:55.293
Cuckoo.

1129
01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.161
Oh, you.

1130
01:08:57.228 --> 01:08:58.997
Ah, go on,
let me in, will ya?

1131
01:08:59.063 --> 01:09:02.601
You know me, I've been here
before. Tony knows me too.

1132
01:09:02.667 --> 01:09:05.504
- What are you trying to pull?
- Nothing.

1133
01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:07.972
Only, you make any joint
look like a speakeasy.

1134
01:09:09.608 --> 01:09:11.175
Oh, Dr. Bell.

1135
01:09:11.242 --> 01:09:13.945
Take good care of Nanny.
She's had a blood transfusion.

1136
01:09:14.012 --> 01:09:16.014
Keep in touch with
me every hour.

1137
01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:17.482
How about, Dr. Ranger?

1138
01:09:17.549 --> 01:09:19.718
I'm gonna settle with
him once and for all.

1139
01:09:19.784 --> 01:09:21.753
I'm gonna engage
a new night nurse too.

1140
01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:23.988
A night nurse? What's
the matter with you, honey?

1141
01:09:24.055 --> 01:09:26.925
It's a certainty, Mrs. Ritchey
will not want Lora around

1142
01:09:26.991 --> 01:09:29.994
after she learns what
Lora has decided to do.

1143
01:09:30.061 --> 01:09:33.665
- Are you gonna sign a warrant?
- If it's the last thing I do.

1144
01:09:33.732 --> 01:09:36.167
Don't be a fool, kid. You'll
never get another job.

1145
01:09:36.234 --> 01:09:39.771
One jam like this and even
the patients are leery of you.

1146
01:09:41.906 --> 01:09:44.543
Will you gimme a lift
downtown? I'm in a hurry.

1147
01:09:44.609 --> 01:09:47.512
Give you a lift? I've been
waiting for the chance.

1148
01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:50.181
Well, how about
a date tonight?

1149
01:09:50.248 --> 01:09:53.017
Well, you're not much
to look at, but you do have

1150
01:09:53.084 --> 01:09:55.053
a way of showing up
when you're needed.

1151
01:09:55.119 --> 01:09:57.355
- Come here.
- By the way, what's your name?

1152
01:09:57.422 --> 01:09:59.023
- Mortie.
- Glad to meet you.

1153
01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:01.726
- Mine's Lora Hart.
- It's the last name I like.

1154
01:10:01.793 --> 01:10:04.362
Say, you won't be able
to drive with one arm.

1155
01:10:04.429 --> 01:10:06.197
Sure, I will.

1156
01:10:06.264 --> 01:10:09.033
When I say shift, shift.

1157
01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:10.101
[whistle blowing]

1158
01:10:10.168 --> 01:10:11.770
Shift.

1159
01:10:13.037 --> 01:10:15.173
Hey, Stupe, look
where you're going.

1160
01:10:17.075 --> 01:10:18.409
Try again.

1161
01:10:21.846 --> 01:10:23.381
- Happy?
- Uh-huh.

1162
01:10:23.448 --> 01:10:25.249
- But there's one thing.
- What?

1163
01:10:25.316 --> 01:10:28.319
I hate to think of Nick
being arrested and all that dirt

1164
01:10:28.386 --> 01:10:31.490
coming out in court on account
of those little kids.

1165
01:10:34.559 --> 01:10:36.695
[siren wailing]

1166
01:10:42.667 --> 01:10:44.335
You know, I've just
been thinking.

1167
01:10:44.402 --> 01:10:46.237
- Maybe Nick won't be arrested.
- Why not?

1168
01:10:46.304 --> 01:10:48.673
Well, I ain't seen him around
since last night.

1169
01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:50.675
- Think he's run away?
- No.

1170
01:10:50.742 --> 01:10:54.078
- Well, what do you think?
- I ain't got an idea.

1171
01:10:54.145 --> 01:10:57.381
I happened to be talking to
a couple of guys last night--

1172
01:10:57.448 --> 01:10:59.183
- What difference does it make?
- Nothing.

1173
01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:02.220
Only, I happened to mention
I didn't like Nick so good.

1174
01:11:02.286 --> 01:11:03.622
[siren wailing]

1175
01:11:10.962 --> 01:11:12.096
[brakes squeal]

1176
01:11:13.598 --> 01:11:16.034
- What is it, for us?
- Nope, for the morgue.

1177
01:11:18.537 --> 01:11:21.105
Some guy got
taken for a ride.

1178
01:11:21.172 --> 01:11:22.507
Bootlegger?

1179
01:11:22.574 --> 01:11:25.744
No, he was wearing
a chauffeur's uniform.

1180
01:11:27.619 --> 01:11:29.154
[whistle blows]

1181
01:11:29.213 --> 01:11:31.382
Shift.

1182
01:11:31.449 --> 01:11:33.251
[honking]
