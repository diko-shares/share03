1
00:01:21.322 --> 00:01:23.723
- Car smash?
- Yeah.

2
00:01:23.891 --> 00:01:26.690
Cement truck
hit one of those baby Austins.

3
00:01:26.861 --> 00:01:29.126
Fractured skull, I guess.

4
00:01:34.502 --> 00:01:37.961
You know, a man's a fool
to ride in those miniature cars.

5
00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:42.235
Be yourself.
This is the guy that drove the truck.

6
00:01:45.746 --> 00:01:47.214
Aww.

7
00:01:47.381 --> 00:01:49.282
- Boy?
- Little girl.

8
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.147
Ah. Ahem. Uh-huh.

9
00:01:53.754 --> 00:01:57.555
Gee, I hope my baby's a boy.

10
00:01:58.025 --> 00:02:01.587
- I'll do my best, Archie.
- Attagirl, Mumsy.

11
00:02:04.832 --> 00:02:07.529
Why can't my son have a screen
around his bed?

12
00:02:07.702 --> 00:02:10.638
- It's against the rules.
- But this man has one.

13
00:02:10.805 --> 00:02:13.639
- Yes. He's dying.
- Oh.

14
00:02:23.451 --> 00:02:24.646
Oh, nuts.

15
00:02:38.065 --> 00:02:41.001
What makes you think
you want to be a nurse?

16
00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:45.606
Why, nursing people has always seemed
sort of a second nature with me.

17
00:02:46.407 --> 00:02:49.036
This is your only recommendation?

18
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.873
Who is this gentleman?
What's his business?

19
00:02:52.046 --> 00:02:54.447
- He's a grocer.
- A grocer?

20
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.011
I'm afraid he knows more about groceries
than about hospitals.

21
00:02:59.186 --> 00:03:01.621
What does he mean
"the time you were at high school"?

22
00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:03.985
Didn't you graduate?

23
00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:07.652
No, I had to leave when my mother died
in the third year.

24
00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.064
Probationary nurse
must be a high school graduate.

25
00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:13.428
I can make it up easy.
I can go to night school.

26
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:16.400
You'll have neither the time
nor the strength with work here.

27
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:19.336
- Oh, I'm sure I would--
- Besides, it wouldn't be allowed.

28
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.040
But I'm sufficiently well educated.
There must be some way.

29
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.647
- Not here.
- Oh, I'm sure I can make good if--

30
00:03:27.148 --> 00:03:29.014
My decision is final.

31
00:03:49.704 --> 00:03:53.436
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- You are in a hurry, aren't you?

32
00:04:19.867 --> 00:04:22.496
- Did I catch the name?
- Hart. Lora Hart.

33
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.538
Hart. That's a good name for a nurse.

34
00:04:25.706 --> 00:04:28.608
Sturdy instrument, the heart.

35
00:04:30.678 --> 00:04:33.842
- Hello, Miss Dillon.
- Oh, good afternoon, doctor.

36
00:04:34.015 --> 00:04:35.950
Now, what can we do
for this young lady?

37
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.884
My dear,
why didn't you mention the doctor?

38
00:04:40.054 --> 00:04:42.455
Of course, doctor, anything you say.

39
00:04:42.623 --> 00:04:46.355
Well, now, suppose you telephone
the principal of Miss Hart's high school...

40
00:04:46.527 --> 00:04:49.395
...and if everything is satisfactory,
we'll waive the rest.

41
00:04:49.563 --> 00:04:51.657
Oh, thank you, doctor.

42
00:04:51.832 --> 00:04:54.666
I hope you realize
what you're letting yourself in for.

43
00:04:54.835 --> 00:04:56.929
Nothing can be too hard.

44
00:04:57.104 --> 00:04:59.801
Now, you take care of her,
will you, Miss Dillon?

45
00:04:59.974 --> 00:05:01.306
I've gotta be going.

46
00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:04.644
This lady will take care of you.

47
00:05:07.114 --> 00:05:10.710
By the way, Dillon, you're doing
something wonderful with the hospital.

48
00:05:10.885 --> 00:05:13.354
Everything runs like a clock.

49
00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:15.285
Thank you, doctor.

50
00:05:15.456 --> 00:05:18.858
I'm sorry you didn't mention Dr. Bell
in the beginning.

51
00:05:24.031 --> 00:05:26.125
You'll find life here pleasant enough.

52
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.532
But there's one thing
you must understand thoroughly:

53
00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:31.764
Rules mean something.

54
00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:34.841
- I understand.
- You'll be told about them later.

55
00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.535
You'll have one hour to yourself
each afternoon...

56
00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:39.374
...and your evenings after 7.

57
00:05:39.547 --> 00:05:43.575
But you're to be in bed
and lights out at 10.

58
00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:45.913
There are no exceptions.

59
00:05:46.087 --> 00:05:48.420
This decision is final.

60
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.555
- I, ahem, see.
- Ahem.

61
00:05:53.394 --> 00:05:55.863
You have one night out a week
until 12...

62
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.159
...and quite a severe penalty
if you're out later.

63
00:06:00.835 --> 00:06:03.304
Miss Maloney, this is Miss Hart.

64
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:05.463
How do you do?

65
00:06:06.507 --> 00:06:09.602
Take Miss Hart to the wardrobe
and help her select some uniforms.

66
00:06:09.777 --> 00:06:12.975
She hopes to be a probationer.

67
00:06:13.948 --> 00:06:16.713
- Miss Maloney will show you.
- Thank you.

68
00:06:17.384 --> 00:06:22.482
Miss Maloney,
you have no one sleeping in your room.

69
00:06:22.656 --> 00:06:24.147
Miss Hart may go with you.

70
00:06:25.693 --> 00:06:28.561
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, Miss Dillon.

71
00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:30.391
Yes, Miss Dillon.

72
00:06:39.206 --> 00:06:41.801
Hype, the new probationer.

73
00:06:41.976 --> 00:06:44.605
- Heads or tails?
- Tails.

74
00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:49.240
Heads. Life is going on for you
in the same old way.

75
00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:55.951
Say, I was afraid the hospital would
burn down before I could get into it.

76
00:06:56.123 --> 00:06:58.183
Now I have to watch myself
with matches.

77
00:06:58.359 --> 00:07:00.225
Well, if you hate it so,
why do you stay?

78
00:07:00.394 --> 00:07:03.057
It's the only job I know
where they pay you to learn.

79
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.893
Oh, I'm sure in your heart
you love it.

80
00:07:06.367 --> 00:07:10.202
- Says you.
- Yeah, says me in a big way, sister.

81
00:07:18.312 --> 00:07:20.645
Oh. Goodness.
Isn't there a smaller one?

82
00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:22.647
If you don't like it, buy your own.

83
00:07:24.018 --> 00:07:26.681
- I can't. I haven't any money.
- Broke?

84
00:07:26.854 --> 00:07:28.584
In a big way, sister.

85
00:07:28.923 --> 00:07:30.858
Any advice?

86
00:07:33.694 --> 00:07:35.788
- What were you doing with the big shot?
- Who?

87
00:07:35.963 --> 00:07:38.489
Dr. Bell. Say, are you kidding me?

88
00:07:38.666 --> 00:07:41.101
- No, why?
- You don't know Bell?

89
00:07:41.268 --> 00:07:44.295
He's the chief of staff.
One of the biggest surgeons in America.

90
00:07:44.471 --> 00:07:45.837
Really?

91
00:07:46.006 --> 00:07:49.807
Why, he just stopped me in the hall
and offered to help me.

92
00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:51.706
Hmm.

93
00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:54.610
For a beginner,
you're not doing so bad.

94
00:07:55.449 --> 00:07:58.078
We'll see if we can find one that fits.

95
00:07:59.386 --> 00:08:00.615
Here, try that.

96
00:08:01.522 --> 00:08:05.323
- Oh, that's much better.
- You better slip off your dress.

97
00:08:05.826 --> 00:08:06.850
Oh, it's okay.

98
00:08:07.628 --> 00:08:09.028
Oh, I suppose so.

99
00:08:09.196 --> 00:08:12.894
I guess everybody around here
has seen more than I've got.

100
00:08:28.048 --> 00:08:30.745
Oh, don't be embarrassed.
You can't show me a thing.

101
00:08:30.918 --> 00:08:32.944
I just came from the delivery room.

102
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.112
What are you doing here,
baby-frightener?

103
00:08:35.856 --> 00:08:40.624
I come on behalf of this big institution
to welcome the new sister to our midst.

104
00:08:40.794 --> 00:08:43.491
You'll find we're just
one big, happy family here.

105
00:08:44.965 --> 00:08:46.593
Beat it, Eagan.

106
00:08:46.767 --> 00:08:49.669
- You're not sore, are you?
- I'm not laughing, veterinary.

107
00:08:49.837 --> 00:08:52.033
How'd you like to go back
to your sick horses?

108
00:08:52.206 --> 00:08:54.505
Sometimes I don't like you, Maloney.

109
00:08:55.142 --> 00:08:57.668
If only I could make that permanent.

110
00:08:57.845 --> 00:08:59.780
What do you say, newcomer?

111
00:08:59.947 --> 00:09:03.475
The score is 2-0, favor of the lady.

112
00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.745
Hmm.

113
00:09:11.091 --> 00:09:13.686
Take my tip and
keep away from interns.

114
00:09:14.995 --> 00:09:17.760
They're like cancer.
The disease is known, but not the cure.

115
00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:18.956
Really?

116
00:09:19.133 --> 00:09:22.592
There's only one guy that can do a nurse
any good, a patient with dough.

117
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.263
Catch one with a fever and a low pulse,
make him think you saved his life...

118
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.932
- ...and you'll be getting somewhere.
- Will I?

119
00:09:29.109 --> 00:09:31.101
- And doctors are no good either.
- Oh, no?

120
00:09:31.278 --> 00:09:33.338
What for? They never marry nurses.

121
00:09:33.514 --> 00:09:35.915
And the trouble
with interns is they do.

122
00:09:36.083 --> 00:09:38.817
All a wife means to an intern is
someone to sit in his office...

123
00:09:38.894 --> 00:09:40.240
when he starts practice...

124
00:09:40.521 --> 00:09:42.922
...and play nurse the rest of her life
without pay.

125
00:09:43.059 --> 00:09:44.266
Oh, I shouldn't like that.

126
00:09:44.322 --> 00:09:46.642
Thing to do is to land
an appendicitis case.

127
00:09:46.794 --> 00:09:48.763
- They've all got dough.
- Oh.

128
00:09:50.597 --> 00:09:52.725
Gee, you look like an ad
for Sloan's Liniment.

129
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.860
I don't care. As long as it means
I'm not gonna be a probe anymore.

130
00:11:16.483 --> 00:11:18.611
Oh, dear.

131
00:11:18.786 --> 00:11:19.981
Don't cry.

132
00:11:20.154 --> 00:11:22.646
Yes, it's a shame.

133
00:11:22.823 --> 00:11:26.555
Yes, it's a shame. There, there.

134
00:11:49.149 --> 00:11:53.712
Gee, it's half past 1.
I was afraid old hatchet-face would see us.

135
00:11:54.262 --> 00:11:55.330
You sap.

136
00:11:55.417 --> 00:11:58.206
She'll be in here to see
if we're in bed.

137
00:11:58.392 --> 00:12:01.487
Oh. We better get in
with all our clothes on.

138
00:12:01.662 --> 00:12:04.757
No, no. Slip your dress off,
put it on the end of the bed here.

139
00:12:04.932 --> 00:12:07.424
If she sees that, it's okay.

140
00:12:12.873 --> 00:12:16.173
Gee, if she switches on the lights
and sees my makeup, I'm sunk.

141
00:12:16.343 --> 00:12:19.211
- Well, turn your face to the wall.
- Oh, don't get funny.

142
00:12:19.379 --> 00:12:22.281
My makeup goes around
the back of my neck.

143
00:12:25.719 --> 00:12:27.051
Hurry up, kid.

144
00:12:27.221 --> 00:12:31.056
If we're caught this time,
it means a month of no nights off.

145
00:12:37.664 --> 00:12:40.429
Oh, some of that goofy Eagan's comedy.

146
00:12:40.601 --> 00:12:42.536
Jump in bed.
I bet hatchet-face heard you.

147
00:12:42.703 --> 00:12:44.103
Oh, I can't. Not with that.

148
00:12:45.472 --> 00:12:46.963
Psst. Get in.

149
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.471
Come in.

150
00:12:55.315 --> 00:12:57.875
Miss Hart, is it possible
you have a man in here?

151
00:12:58.051 --> 00:13:00.611
You worm. I hope you get caught
in the nurses' quarters.

152
00:13:00.787 --> 00:13:03.120
- You know what you'll get for that.
- Boo!

153
00:13:13.355 --> 00:13:14.394
Here he is again.

154
00:13:14.481 --> 00:13:17.213
Let him have it,
and make it a bull's-eye.

155
00:13:19.072 --> 00:13:20.904
Come in.

156
00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:32.642
Who threw that slipper?

157
00:13:36.056 --> 00:13:37.080
What, ma'am?

158
00:13:38.025 --> 00:13:39.789
What, Miss Dillon?

159
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.485
What, Miss Dillon?

160
00:13:41.662 --> 00:13:45.190
- Did you throw that slipper?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

161
00:13:46.333 --> 00:13:48.632
- Well, Hart?
- Well, you see, I--

162
00:13:48.802 --> 00:13:51.601
Take two weeks on the night shift
at the emergency clinic.

163
00:13:57.978 --> 00:14:00.846
I thought so.
You've both just come in.

164
00:14:01.014 --> 00:14:02.217
We had to walk home.

165
00:14:02.373 --> 00:14:04.372
This isn't your first offense,
Miss Maloney.

166
00:14:04.518 --> 00:14:07.420
You'll take four weeks
on the same night shift.

167
00:14:07.588 --> 00:14:10.114
- Thank you.
- And take two more for impertinence.

168
00:14:19.866 --> 00:14:22.131
See what you get for yelling?

169
00:14:22.302 --> 00:14:25.295
Say, suppose you found a skeleton
in your bed.

170
00:14:25.472 --> 00:14:28.909
If I could dodge that night shift,
I'd live with one.

171
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.217
Oh, quit your trembling, kid.
It can't walk around.

172
00:14:37.384 --> 00:14:40.411
Dillon's face took
all the pep out of it.

173
00:14:44.024 --> 00:14:48.086
Well, at least he can't clear his throat.

174
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.036
Just a scalp wound.

175
00:15:08.382 --> 00:15:11.784
- Oh, doctor.
- Hold tight to my hand when it hurts.

176
00:15:12.152 --> 00:15:15.213
You're certainly charitable
with that hand of yours.

177
00:15:15.389 --> 00:15:17.085
Was he hit anywhere else?

178
00:15:17.257 --> 00:15:20.125
Sorry, but that's all.

179
00:15:22.796 --> 00:15:24.458
Just put a bandage on him.

180
00:15:25.799 --> 00:15:27.358
Give him a shot of anti-tetanus.

181
00:15:27.534 --> 00:15:30.368
- What's that for?
- Prevents lockjaw.

182
00:15:30.537 --> 00:15:31.766
Lockjaw?

183
00:15:31.938 --> 00:15:35.306
Ask Miss Maloney about it.
She's been fighting it off all her life.

184
00:15:35.475 --> 00:15:36.670
Grit your teeth, prisoner.

185
00:15:36.843 --> 00:15:39.836
Just two more smart cracks
and Dr. Mayo is through.

186
00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:43.113
Shall I take him
to the station house?

187
00:15:43.283 --> 00:15:44.649
Oh, I don't think we'd better.

188
00:15:44.818 --> 00:15:47.185
Let's keep him here tonight.

189
00:15:47.721 --> 00:15:50.088
Yeah, prison ward.

190
00:15:58.932 --> 00:16:00.423
Come on.

191
00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.432
Come on.

192
00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.873
- Hey, hey.
- The tougher, the softer.

193
00:16:09.042 --> 00:16:11.534
Better get us a lift, lunkhead,
he's fainted.

194
00:16:11.712 --> 00:16:13.112
Huh?

195
00:16:14.681 --> 00:16:18.413
Oh, all right, Florence Nightingale.

196
00:16:28.562 --> 00:16:31.327
Could a guy bum some bandages
and iodine in here?

197
00:16:32.232 --> 00:16:34.792
- Are you hurt?
- No. It's a friend of mine.

198
00:16:34.968 --> 00:16:36.903
He got a little cut on his hand.

199
00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:40.097
- Come in, I'll see what I can do.
- Oh, maybe I better wait here.

200
00:16:40.974 --> 00:16:43.136
- Come in.
- Ouch!

201
00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:45.706
You're the one that's hurt.

202
00:16:47.013 --> 00:16:49.209
All right, I'll come in.

203
00:16:51.718 --> 00:16:53.710
Let's see your hand.

204
00:16:57.491 --> 00:17:00.359
You'll have to get up earlier
than most bootleggers to fool me.

205
00:17:00.527 --> 00:17:04.328
- Huh? How do you get that way?
- We get many like you in here.

206
00:17:04.498 --> 00:17:06.797
- Oh, give us the iodine, will you?
- I'll fix it.

207
00:17:06.967 --> 00:17:09.835
Say, I could do it myself
if you'd just give me the--

208
00:17:12.305 --> 00:17:13.705
I guess I better sit down.

209
00:17:18.545 --> 00:17:21.538
- Hey, what's the idea?
- It's the arm, isn't it?

210
00:17:21.715 --> 00:17:23.547
Oh, all right.

211
00:17:25.719 --> 00:17:26.743
This one here.

212
00:17:32.292 --> 00:17:33.954
Thanks.

213
00:17:45.071 --> 00:17:46.403
Say, that's silk.

214
00:17:46.573 --> 00:17:49.407
That's how I know you're a bootlegger.

215
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.808
You win.

216
00:17:53.847 --> 00:17:55.315
That looks like a bullet wound.

217
00:17:55.482 --> 00:17:58.509
Well, it's a cinch
it ain't a vaccination mark.

218
00:18:03.957 --> 00:18:05.926
I'll have to make
a police report of this.

219
00:18:06.393 --> 00:18:08.794
Yeah? Why?

220
00:18:09.196 --> 00:18:11.290
It has to be done
on all bullet-wound cases.

221
00:18:11.465 --> 00:18:13.457
- Oh, say, that ain't necessary.
- I have to.

222
00:18:13.633 --> 00:18:16.125
Oh, listen, sister,
what's the difference to you?

223
00:18:16.303 --> 00:18:18.363
I could get into trouble if I didn't.

224
00:18:18.638 --> 00:18:21.631
Listen, just give me some bandages
and forget you ever saw me.

225
00:18:24.911 --> 00:18:26.709
How did it happen?

226
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.181
Well, a guy was cleaning a gun
and it went off.

227
00:18:31.351 --> 00:18:32.375
Oh, nonsense.

228
00:18:32.513 --> 00:18:33.623
Well, that's my story,

229
00:18:33.687 --> 00:18:37.014
and a couple of cops with rubber hoses
can't make me change it.

230
00:18:38.225 --> 00:18:39.853
Oh.

231
00:18:42.829 --> 00:18:44.627
Where was this man cleaning the gun?

232
00:18:46.132 --> 00:18:47.156
In a limousine.

233
00:18:48.034 --> 00:18:51.436
It hit a bump and the gun went off.

234
00:18:51.771 --> 00:18:53.034
Why did they wanna get you?

235
00:18:53.206 --> 00:18:55.300
Oh, because I won't buy
their bum alcohol.

236
00:18:55.475 --> 00:18:57.569
I don't poison people.

237
00:18:57.744 --> 00:19:00.646
Why don't you tell who these men are
and have them arrested?

238
00:19:00.814 --> 00:19:05.013
For the same reason you don't squeal
about half the raw work you see down here.

239
00:19:09.289 --> 00:19:10.655
What do you mean?

240
00:19:10.824 --> 00:19:14.056
Well, do you?

241
00:19:14.694 --> 00:19:17.459
Why, we have professional ethics.

242
00:19:18.131 --> 00:19:22.000
Yeah? That goes for my line too.

243
00:19:23.603 --> 00:19:27.540
The things my profession keep quiet about,
we believe it's for the public's own good.

244
00:19:27.707 --> 00:19:30.108
Yeah? Ditto.

245
00:19:35.715 --> 00:19:38.480
Well, it's gone clear through.
You've lost a lot of blood.

246
00:19:42.022 --> 00:19:43.615
What's up?

247
00:19:45.926 --> 00:19:47.189
Say, that's a bullet wound.

248
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.421
Hey, nobody sent for you.
Go rustle your hot-water bottles.

249
00:19:50.597 --> 00:19:52.532
This is no hot-water bottle.

250
00:19:54.534 --> 00:19:57.993
- Did you get this bird's name and address?
- I don't think that's necessary.

251
00:19:58.171 --> 00:20:01.107
Don't you know that you're
supposed to report all bullet wounds?

252
00:20:01.274 --> 00:20:03.573
You didn't see any bullet wound.

253
00:20:03.743 --> 00:20:05.371
I didn't?

254
00:20:05.545 --> 00:20:07.639
Say, what's the idea?

255
00:20:07.814 --> 00:20:09.077
Friend of yours?

256
00:20:11.484 --> 00:20:12.508
Thanks, pal.

257
00:20:12.686 --> 00:20:15.212
He'd have to be hot
before I'd take a chance like that.

258
00:20:15.388 --> 00:20:17.823
- You said something, sister.
- Hold quiet, will you?

259
00:20:17.991 --> 00:20:19.892
Okay.

260
00:20:21.861 --> 00:20:23.853
Hey, are you really taking a chance?

261
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:28.400
I'll say she is. All a nurse needs to do
is to get into one jam and she's through.

262
00:20:28.568 --> 00:20:30.730
- Yeah?
- Oh, don't talk so much.

263
00:20:31.171 --> 00:20:33.367
You might as well turn in
your uniform and quit.

264
00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:37.033
Maybe 56 bucks a week isn't much,
but it's 56 bucks.

265
00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:38.735
Hey, is that all they pay you?

266
00:20:38.912 --> 00:20:40.437
Better than selling apples.

267
00:20:40.614 --> 00:20:42.959
That's probably what she'll be doing
if she loses her diploma.

268
00:20:42.983 --> 00:20:44.281
Shh!

269
00:20:45.018 --> 00:20:46.151
There you are.

270
00:20:46.205 --> 00:20:48.604
It's a nasty cut,
but it'll be all right now.

271
00:20:55.829 --> 00:20:58.355
- Dump this.
- Thanks, sister.

272
00:20:59.699 --> 00:21:00.962
My pal.

273
00:21:04.971 --> 00:21:06.200
What's his trouble?

274
00:21:06.373 --> 00:21:08.308
He fell down stairs
and cut his shoulder.

275
00:21:08.475 --> 00:21:12.310
- Walks like he'd lost a lot of blood.
- No, just drunk.

276
00:21:14.648 --> 00:21:15.775
Oh.

277
00:21:23.323 --> 00:21:27.055
Hey, Maloney,
don't forget to wash that bedpan.

278
00:21:27.827 --> 00:21:30.422
And make it shiny.

279
00:21:31.731 --> 00:21:33.927
Yes, do that.

280
00:21:46.946 --> 00:21:49.108
Oh, calm down, Lora.

281
00:21:51.518 --> 00:21:52.850
You've seen blood before.

282
00:21:53.019 --> 00:21:55.511
Just because this is your first
don't make it worse.

283
00:21:55.689 --> 00:21:56.952
- I know--
- Heaven's sakes...

284
00:21:57.123 --> 00:21:59.558
...if you get dizzy or feel faint,
keep an eye on me.

285
00:21:59.726 --> 00:22:01.285
Remember, this is the final test.

286
00:22:01.461 --> 00:22:04.625
And if you pass out this time,
you don't graduate.

287
00:22:05.532 --> 00:22:07.330
Okay.

288
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.264
Wait a minute.

289
00:22:09.869 --> 00:22:13.362
I almost forgot this.
A man left this here.

290
00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:17.477
He said it was to be given to you
before you went into your big test.

291
00:22:20.346 --> 00:22:22.338
He seemed to think
you'd know who he was.

292
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:47.236
- Well, of all the--
- That's what I call a pal.

293
00:22:47.407 --> 00:22:49.501
- What'll I do with it?
- Put it away for her.

294
00:22:49.676 --> 00:22:53.169
But you're not allowed to drink.
What's it good for?

295
00:22:53.346 --> 00:22:55.212
It's swell for cleaning teeth.

296
00:23:32.685 --> 00:23:37.316
Boy, are we lucky to get in on
an operation as big as this.

297
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.857
Well, I hope Dr. Bell gets away with it.

298
00:23:40.026 --> 00:23:42.586
He's got one chance in a hundred.

299
00:24:03.082 --> 00:24:04.106
Oxygen.

300
00:25:12.151 --> 00:25:13.551
Does that happen often?

301
00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.451
No. But when it does, it's bad news.

302
00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:18.882
It's horrible.

303
00:25:19.058 --> 00:25:22.222
Well, come on, let's get out of here.
My teeth need cleaning.

304
00:25:33.039 --> 00:25:34.507
Now, young ladies...

305
00:25:34.674 --> 00:25:39.374
...you who are about to graduate
to the noble profession of nursing...

306
00:25:39.545 --> 00:25:44.176
...will recite
the Florence Nightingale pledge.

307
00:25:45.518 --> 00:25:49.956
I solemnly pledge myself before God...

308
00:25:50.123 --> 00:25:52.752
...and in the presence
of this assembly...

309
00:25:52.926 --> 00:25:59.093
...to pass my life in purity
and practice my profession faithfully.

310
00:25:59.565 --> 00:26:04.128
I will abstain from whatever
is deleterious and mischievous...

311
00:26:04.304 --> 00:26:09.572
...and will not take or knowingly
administer any harmful drug.

312
00:26:09.876 --> 00:26:15.076
I will do all in my power to elevate
the standard of my profession...

313
00:26:15.248 --> 00:26:17.376
...and will hold in confidence...

314
00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:21.009
...all personal matters
committed to my keeping...

315
00:26:21.187 --> 00:26:24.988
...and all family affairs
coming to my knowledge...

316
00:26:25.158 --> 00:26:27.252
...in the practice of my calling.

317
00:26:27.727 --> 00:26:33.633
With loyalty will I endeavor
to aid the physician in his work...

318
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:37.100
...and devote myself to the welfare...

319
00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:40.763
...of those committed to my care.

320
00:27:12.505 --> 00:27:13.768
I'm the new night nurse.

321
00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.705
Oh? For the two little girls?

322
00:27:16.876 --> 00:27:19.243
Yes. I had them at the hospital
some months ago.

323
00:27:19.412 --> 00:27:20.744
Poor little kiddies.

324
00:27:20.913 --> 00:27:24.406
It's a long time since I've seen them
toddling up these stairs.

325
00:27:27.186 --> 00:27:30.452
- Good night, kiddies.
- Good night, Miss Maloney.

326
00:27:30.623 --> 00:27:33.457
- Hello there.
- Well, it's about time you showed up.

327
00:27:33.626 --> 00:27:36.391
- I'm dying on my feet.
- How did you wangle me into this job?

328
00:27:36.562 --> 00:27:40.124
I told Svengali the kids knew you
at the hospital and were crazy about you.

329
00:27:40.299 --> 00:27:41.790
Thanks. Who's Svengali?

330
00:27:41.968 --> 00:27:44.028
Dr. Ranger. He's a new one on me.

331
00:27:44.203 --> 00:27:48.106
He's not on any hospital staff I know of,
but he's sure the boss around here.

332
00:27:48.274 --> 00:27:50.641
Why did they take Dr. Bell off the case?

333
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:52.442
That's what I'd like to know.

334
00:27:53.112 --> 00:27:57.049
Certainly seems funny to me, replacing
a man like Dr. Bell with an unknown.

335
00:27:58.184 --> 00:28:01.586
- Say, there's something screwy about this.
- What do you mean?

336
00:28:01.754 --> 00:28:03.644
Since those kids got
back from the hospital,

337
00:28:03.748 --> 00:28:05.715
they've been living
on nothing but milk.

338
00:28:05.858 --> 00:28:08.157
That's no cure for anemia,
or malnutrition either.

339
00:28:08.327 --> 00:28:11.058
- I'll say it isn't.
- They were all right at the hospital.

340
00:28:11.198 --> 00:28:13.197
Dr. Bell said they were
getting along great.

341
00:28:13.254 --> 00:28:14.452
Aren't they improving?

342
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.331
No, they're getting worse.
And I'm beginning to wonder why.

343
00:28:17.503 --> 00:28:19.404
But why should anyone--?

344
00:28:19.572 --> 00:28:21.268
Oh, you're crazy.

345
00:28:21.441 --> 00:28:24.843
Maybe. I don't know a thing.
I just work here.

346
00:28:25.611 --> 00:28:27.637
Any more instructions, Miss Maloney?

347
00:28:27.814 --> 00:28:30.215
No, Miss Hart.
Oh, yes, there's a chart pinned up...

348
00:28:30.383 --> 00:28:32.648
...in the kitchenette
beyond the children's room.

349
00:28:32.819 --> 00:28:33.912
- Kitchenette?
- Yeah.

350
00:28:34.087 --> 00:28:37.023
Kitchen, bathroom, sitting room
with every bedroom.

351
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:41.025
This dump's a palace.
But not for those kids.

352
00:28:44.664 --> 00:28:47.429
And, say,
keep your eye open for old eczema.

353
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.434
- Who?
- Mrs. Maxwell. She's the housekeeper.

354
00:28:50.603 --> 00:28:52.401
Wait till you see her.

355
00:28:52.572 --> 00:28:54.200
Well, so long, honey. I got a date.

356
00:28:54.373 --> 00:28:56.137
- With whom?
- Oh, you don't know him.

357
00:28:56.309 --> 00:28:57.641
A gorgeous new boyfriend.

358
00:28:57.810 --> 00:28:59.745
- Intern?
- I should say not.

359
00:28:59.912 --> 00:29:01.175
I'm not all crazy.

360
00:29:06.819 --> 00:29:08.151
Children, what are you doing?

361
00:29:08.321 --> 00:29:11.450
Miss Hart. Miss Hart.

362
00:29:14.227 --> 00:29:17.026
Stop it. Lie down, both of you.

363
00:29:21.601 --> 00:29:24.594
Nanny, you silly little girl.
You shouldn't try things like that.

364
00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:29.231
- You're not strong enough.
- I tried all I could, Desney.

365
00:29:29.408 --> 00:29:31.900
Of course you did, Nanny.

366
00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.372
Poor little baby.

367
00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.316
I didn't mean any harm.

368
00:29:43.489 --> 00:29:45.117
I know you didn't, Desney.

369
00:29:45.291 --> 00:29:47.055
But now you must both be quiet.

370
00:29:47.226 --> 00:29:49.786
We will, won't we, Nanny?

371
00:29:49.962 --> 00:29:52.522
- Yes. We will.
- That's good.

372
00:29:52.698 --> 00:29:57.363
- We like you. Don't we, Nanny?
- Mm-hm.

373
00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:01.236
What's your other name?
You didn't tell us at the hospital.

374
00:30:01.407 --> 00:30:03.342
It's Lora. Lora Hart.

375
00:30:03.509 --> 00:30:06.172
Lora? We had a sister named Lora.

376
00:30:06.345 --> 00:30:07.938
But she's dead.

377
00:30:08.981 --> 00:30:11.041
Oh, poor little baby.

378
00:30:11.217 --> 00:30:12.845
You mustn't talk about her anymore.

379
00:30:13.019 --> 00:30:15.648
She was runned over. She was all cut.

380
00:30:15.821 --> 00:30:18.484
Cut in lots of places,
wasn't she, Nanny?

381
00:30:19.125 --> 00:30:23.290
All over, here and here and here.

382
00:30:23.462 --> 00:30:26.091
Oh, you ought to seen her.

383
00:30:26.732 --> 00:30:29.861
You mustn't think about her.
You must go to sleep, both of you.

384
00:30:30.036 --> 00:30:32.505
We didn't see her, but they told us.

385
00:30:32.672 --> 00:30:35.267
Nick told us, and he showed us too.

386
00:30:35.441 --> 00:30:37.569
- Who's Nick?
- He lives here.

387
00:30:37.743 --> 00:30:40.212
- That's not your father, is it?
- No.

388
00:30:40.379 --> 00:30:42.507
Daddy's up in heaven too.

389
00:30:43.115 --> 00:30:45.584
Oh, I'm sorry.

390
00:30:46.686 --> 00:30:48.917
Now, come on, both of you. Into bed.

391
00:30:49.088 --> 00:30:53.082
Nick's not like Daddy.
Daddy was a nice man.

392
00:30:53.259 --> 00:30:54.852
Isn't Nick a nice man?

393
00:30:55.261 --> 00:30:57.856
No. He's a horrid man.
Isn't he, Nanny?

394
00:31:00.266 --> 00:31:02.667
Oh, Nanny, darling, don't cry, honey.

395
00:31:03.202 --> 00:31:06.502
Such a nice home, lovely things...

396
00:31:06.672 --> 00:31:08.971
...and you're going
to get well real soon.

397
00:31:09.141 --> 00:31:11.133
It isn't a lovely home.

398
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:13.370
We didn't wanna come home.
Did we, Nanny?

399
00:31:13.546 --> 00:31:14.639
No.

400
00:31:14.814 --> 00:31:16.180
Nick scares us.

401
00:31:16.349 --> 00:31:17.749
Doesn't he, Nanny?

402
00:31:17.917 --> 00:31:19.943
He says the most awful things.

403
00:31:20.119 --> 00:31:22.714
- You should tell your mother.
- We can't.

404
00:31:22.888 --> 00:31:26.290
She won't come and see us anymore.

405
00:31:26.859 --> 00:31:29.158
Why aren't you two asleep?

406
00:31:31.063 --> 00:31:32.953
They shouldn't be kept awake like this.

407
00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:35.354
I've been trying to
make them go to sleep.

408
00:31:35.501 --> 00:31:37.493
- That's true.
- Then why didn't you?

409
00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:40.265
We were hungry. Weren't we, Nanny?

410
00:31:40.439 --> 00:31:42.237
Hungry? Don't be absurd.

411
00:31:42.408 --> 00:31:46.004
But we are hungry.
We're always hungry.

412
00:31:46.178 --> 00:31:49.546
- I want to speak to you.
- Are you Mrs. Maxwell?

413
00:31:49.715 --> 00:31:52.913
Yes. I have charge of the children.

414
00:31:53.085 --> 00:31:56.351
I don't want to hear another word
out of you, either of you.

415
00:32:02.361 --> 00:32:04.421
I wish we had something to eat.

416
00:32:04.597 --> 00:32:07.431
Shh, or she'll come back.

417
00:32:08.734 --> 00:32:12.501
Miss Hart, I must warn you not to be upset
by anything the children may tell you.

418
00:32:12.672 --> 00:32:13.970
They've been very sick.

419
00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.405
Yes, I know.
I had charge of them at the hospital.

420
00:32:17.576 --> 00:32:18.669
Oh.

421
00:32:18.844 --> 00:32:21.871
Since they've been home,
they've had bad dreams. Nightmares.

422
00:32:22.048 --> 00:32:24.483
Dr. Ranger says
that's all part of their illness.

423
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:29.149
But they're too young to know
the difference between dreams and facts.

424
00:32:30.323 --> 00:32:33.316
You must realize that
whenever they tell you anything.

425
00:32:34.794 --> 00:32:37.923
I see. Thank you.

426
00:32:40.199 --> 00:32:42.691
That's all I had to say.

427
00:33:12.231 --> 00:33:14.029
Who are you?

428
00:33:18.804 --> 00:33:20.397
What do you want?

429
00:33:20.573 --> 00:33:23.668
A lady needs a little assistance.

430
00:33:23.843 --> 00:33:24.902
What lady?

431
00:33:25.077 --> 00:33:28.047
Shh. You'll never guess.

432
00:33:53.806 --> 00:33:56.833
- What happened?
- She passed out.

433
00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.715
Who is it, Mrs. Ritchey?
The children's mother?

434
00:34:04.617 --> 00:34:07.382
Hm? What did you say?

435
00:34:26.105 --> 00:34:29.075
Are you going to be decent and leave?

436
00:34:30.443 --> 00:34:32.503
I've got to undress her.

437
00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:34.442
It's all right.

438
00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:39.550
Just the type.

439
00:34:40.986 --> 00:34:42.454
Huh?

440
00:34:43.055 --> 00:34:44.853
What did you say?

441
00:35:01.474 --> 00:35:04.876
- Come here.
- Cut that out.

442
00:35:11.083 --> 00:35:15.646
- Leave me alone.
- I want a kiss. I want a kiss.

443
00:35:18.524 --> 00:35:20.083
I tell you, I want a kiss.

444
00:35:20.259 --> 00:35:22.057
Stop it!

445
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:26.665
Let me alone.

446
00:35:43.282 --> 00:35:44.773
- Thank you.
- Never mind that.

447
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:47.510
- Get busy, give her a stomach wash.
- I'll call a doctor.

448
00:35:47.686 --> 00:35:49.985
Listen. You'll do what I tell you.

449
00:35:50.489 --> 00:35:53.482
- You trying to do what he did?
- No, but you're not gonna call.

450
00:35:53.659 --> 00:35:56.993
- You're a nurse. You give her the wash.
- I can't, except under orders.

451
00:35:57.162 --> 00:36:00.030
Oh, yes, you can.
And what's more, you will.

452
00:36:00.199 --> 00:36:03.294
I can't very well with a broken wrist.

453
00:36:10.876 --> 00:36:14.244
- Operator, get me a doctor, quick.
- End that or I'll break your neck.

454
00:36:14.413 --> 00:36:15.904
- What right have you to?
- Plenty.

455
00:36:16.081 --> 00:36:18.550
- Hello, big boy.
- Oh, shut up.

456
00:36:18.717 --> 00:36:22.210
Oh, don't be sore, Nicky. Kiss me.

457
00:36:22.388 --> 00:36:24.880
- Get busy.
- I can't without the proper authority.

458
00:36:25.057 --> 00:36:26.958
- I give you the authority.
- Who are you?

459
00:36:27.126 --> 00:36:30.790
I'm Nick, the chauffeur.

460
00:36:32.932 --> 00:36:34.423
Oh.

461
00:36:36.101 --> 00:36:39.538
Operator? Operator? Operator?

462
00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:52.508
Don't be sore, big boy.
Where you going?

463
00:37:55.981 --> 00:37:58.246
You dirty, lousy....

464
00:38:09.261 --> 00:38:12.527
And I tell you, I wouldn't go through
another night like that again...

465
00:38:12.698 --> 00:38:15.600
- ...for all the money they could pay me.
- Well, then what?

466
00:38:15.768 --> 00:38:19.603
I locked the doors and windows and sat up
until morning expecting that brute back.

467
00:38:19.772 --> 00:38:21.172
- Well, did he?
- No, but--

468
00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:25.300
I see. It's unfortunate, Miss Hart, but not
much likelihood of its happening again.

469
00:38:25.477 --> 00:38:27.139
I'm going to make sure it doesn't.

470
00:38:27.312 --> 00:38:28.644
- Forget it.
- The police.

471
00:38:28.814 --> 00:38:30.510
- What'll that get you?
- You don't--

472
00:38:30.683 --> 00:38:32.515
- Who'd believe you?
- Believe me?

473
00:38:32.685 --> 00:38:35.052
The Ritcheys
wouldn't let you get away with that.

474
00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.155
Blackmail's a pretty dangerous game.

475
00:38:37.322 --> 00:38:38.756
- Blackmail?
- You heard me.

476
00:38:38.924 --> 00:38:41.723
- Well, then, you don't believe me?
- Why should I?

477
00:38:41.894 --> 00:38:44.557
- But, Dr. Ranger--
- I visited that house daily for months.

478
00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:48.497
- And I see no evidence of all this rot.
- Oh, yes, you have. You know you have.

479
00:38:48.667 --> 00:38:52.069
I thought you were a reputable physician.
I came here to ask your advice.

480
00:38:52.237 --> 00:38:54.263
You shall have it:
mind your own business.

481
00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:58.434
You're in that house to watch two patients,
not to oversee the conduct of its members.

482
00:38:58.610 --> 00:39:00.374
Am I to take blows from its servants?

483
00:39:00.546 --> 00:39:03.243
- I've said that wouldn't happen again.
- You guarantee that?

484
00:39:03.415 --> 00:39:04.508
That'll do, Miss Hart.

485
00:39:04.683 --> 00:39:06.879
You've forgotten your place long enough.

486
00:39:07.052 --> 00:39:09.988
Quiet down, now,
and I'll see that you're fully compensated.

487
00:39:10.155 --> 00:39:11.350
- Is that all?
- It isn't.

488
00:39:11.523 --> 00:39:13.549
- Well?
- Something's gotta be done.

489
00:39:13.726 --> 00:39:15.991
- You speaking of my patients?
- You are the doctor.

490
00:39:16.161 --> 00:39:18.494
The way things are going,
those babies won't last.

491
00:39:18.664 --> 00:39:19.757
Well, that's news to me.

492
00:39:19.932 --> 00:39:22.731
Dr. Ranger, they're slowly dying
of undernourishment.

493
00:39:22.901 --> 00:39:27.271
- Aren't my instructions being followed?
- I suppose so. Here.

494
00:39:29.308 --> 00:39:31.140
See about....

495
00:39:31.844 --> 00:39:33.904
Yeah, quite correct.

496
00:39:34.079 --> 00:39:36.844
But I know starvation symptoms
when I see them.

497
00:39:37.015 --> 00:39:39.007
- I take it you don't approve--
- No, I don't.

498
00:39:39.184 --> 00:39:41.551
- It's your first case, isn't it?
- Well, what of it?

499
00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:42.915
You've been on one night.

500
00:39:43.088 --> 00:39:44.215
It's only natural...

501
00:39:44.389 --> 00:39:47.985
...that you should get excited
about something that puzzles you.

502
00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.425
You know, Miss Hart,
you talk too much.

503
00:39:50.596 --> 00:39:53.657
You've picked up half-baked
medical knowledge around the hospital.

504
00:39:53.832 --> 00:39:55.494
All nurses do.

505
00:39:55.667 --> 00:39:57.448
I wouldn't air it quite so freely.

506
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:59.355
You'll talk yourself out
of your profession.

507
00:39:59.505 --> 00:40:03.670
- Don't think you can muzzle me.
- I'm not trying to. I'm giving you advice.

508
00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:05.482
You don't wanna take it,
get off the case.

509
00:40:05.584 --> 00:40:06.608
I resign.

510
00:40:06.945 --> 00:40:09.642
I warn you, if you do,
you're through as a licensed nurse.

511
00:40:09.815 --> 00:40:12.910
- Oh, a threat?
- Exactly. Your kind is too dangerous.

512
00:40:13.485 --> 00:40:15.681
I have no doubt of it,
to your kind of doctor...

513
00:40:15.854 --> 00:40:18.915
...but I'm gonna find someone
who will listen to me.

514
00:40:25.063 --> 00:40:27.999
Riverside 12468.

515
00:40:29.768 --> 00:40:31.396
Hello.

516
00:40:32.871 --> 00:40:35.568
Uh, Nick, this is Dr. Ranger.

517
00:40:35.741 --> 00:40:38.734
Now, listen carefully
and I'll tell you what I want you to do.

518
00:40:39.778 --> 00:40:41.041
I know it's my first case.

519
00:40:41.213 --> 00:40:45.082
And I know Dr. Ranger's a big man,
but I've got to do something.

520
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:47.048
You got me the job, that's why I came.

521
00:40:47.219 --> 00:40:49.848
- But, my dear child--
- I'm sorry to drag you into this.

522
00:40:50.022 --> 00:40:53.515
But those poor little kids are starving.
Anybody can see it in their faces.

523
00:40:53.692 --> 00:40:56.218
And if somebody doesn't do something,
they won't last.

524
00:40:56.395 --> 00:40:57.920
Don't get so worked up about it.

525
00:40:58.096 --> 00:41:00.190
Don't you think I know
starvation symptoms?

526
00:41:00.365 --> 00:41:03.733
- Yes, I suppose you do.
- Well, then, won't you do something?

527
00:41:03.902 --> 00:41:06.428
You know I can't interfere
in another doctor's case.

528
00:41:06.605 --> 00:41:08.870
Why can't you, when things like this
are going on?

529
00:41:09.041 --> 00:41:11.067
Why? It's about as unethical--

530
00:41:11.243 --> 00:41:14.873
Oh, ethics, ethics! That's all I've heard
since I've been in this business.

531
00:41:15.047 --> 00:41:16.515
Isn't there any humanity in it?

532
00:41:16.682 --> 00:41:19.311
Aren't there any ethics
about letting babies be murdered?

533
00:41:19.484 --> 00:41:21.749
Steady. You need proof
when you talk that way.

534
00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.515
What more proof do I need
than what I've already got?

535
00:41:24.857 --> 00:41:26.689
Well, why don't you cool down a bit?

536
00:41:26.859 --> 00:41:29.158
Those kids were getting along
when you had them.

537
00:41:29.328 --> 00:41:31.593
- Why were you taken off the case?
- I don't know.

538
00:41:31.763 --> 00:41:34.130
Ranger's a rotten doctor.
You know his reputation.

539
00:41:34.299 --> 00:41:36.200
- I can't discuss that.
- It isn't ethical.

540
00:41:36.368 --> 00:41:39.736
Well, I can. Why doesn't he belong
to the medical association?

541
00:41:39.905 --> 00:41:42.397
Why hasn't he got a job
on some decent hospital staff?

542
00:41:42.574 --> 00:41:46.306
Because he's shady, and you know it,
as well as every other doctor in this city.

543
00:41:46.478 --> 00:41:50.506
I know a lot of things inside
the profession that I can't advertise.

544
00:41:50.682 --> 00:41:53.880
I also know that Dr. Ranger
has a tremendous practice.

545
00:41:54.052 --> 00:41:56.112
And that alone
can keep him out of trouble.

546
00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:58.542
If I stir things up,
if I go to the authorities,

547
00:41:58.661 --> 00:41:59.872
what does it look like?

548
00:41:59.983 --> 00:42:00.589
Jealousy.

549
00:42:00.614 --> 00:42:02.429
Argue yourself out
of your responsibility.

550
00:42:02.461 --> 00:42:04.794
- I'll see this through.
- Will you be reasonable?

551
00:42:04.963 --> 00:42:06.989
No! I won't see this
go on another minute.

552
00:42:07.165 --> 00:42:08.793
- I'm going to the police.
- Lora!

553
00:42:09.167 --> 00:42:11.261
Don't you realize
they'll only laugh at you?

554
00:42:11.436 --> 00:42:13.264
You, a nurse on her first job,

555
00:42:13.569 --> 00:42:15.864
trying to pit your opinion
against a man like Dr. Ranger.

556
00:42:16.008 --> 00:42:17.874
Oh, what'll I do? It's maddening.

557
00:42:18.043 --> 00:42:19.636
Two little babies being murdered.

558
00:42:19.811 --> 00:42:22.007
I could go out
and yell it on the street.

559
00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:25.275
Listen, you've got to convince people
that what you say is true.

560
00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:27.851
- How?
- Hysterics won't do it.

561
00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.922
I'll calm down,
if you'll only tell me what to do.

562
00:42:31.089 --> 00:42:33.339
My advice is for you
to go back on that job.

563
00:42:33.393 --> 00:42:35.892
- What?
- If you are convinced of malpractice...

564
00:42:36.028 --> 00:42:40.022
...you can do more good there than
you can shouting around on the outside.

565
00:42:40.198 --> 00:42:42.633
Go back and watch those kids.

566
00:42:42.801 --> 00:42:45.737
We've got to play Ranger
at his own game.

567
00:42:46.371 --> 00:42:50.536
It's a risky business,
and it's right under Ranger's nose.

568
00:42:50.709 --> 00:42:55.477
But if he wants to murder those youngsters,
we'll make him use a gun.

569
00:42:56.048 --> 00:42:59.212
I came to apologize
for the way I acted this morning.

570
00:42:59.885 --> 00:43:02.286
So you've thought it over?

571
00:43:02.454 --> 00:43:04.047
Yes, I'm terribly sorry.

572
00:43:04.222 --> 00:43:07.192
I hadn't gotten over
the shock of last night.

573
00:43:07.359 --> 00:43:10.386
I didn't realize what I was saying.
I hope you'll overlook it.

574
00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:13.193
Who were you talking to?

575
00:43:13.832 --> 00:43:17.462
Why, I didn't discuss it with anyone.

576
00:43:17.636 --> 00:43:19.764
I just sat in the park
and thought things over.

577
00:43:19.938 --> 00:43:22.874
I realized I was simply
throwing my career away.

578
00:43:23.041 --> 00:43:24.566
And I can't do that.

579
00:43:26.345 --> 00:43:28.177
I thought you'd come around.

580
00:43:28.347 --> 00:43:30.543
You're not the first
hysterical nurse I've seen.

581
00:43:30.716 --> 00:43:33.709
- You'll forgive me, then?
- Entirely forgotten.

582
00:43:33.885 --> 00:43:36.320
On both sides.

583
00:43:36.822 --> 00:43:40.020
- That little business of last night?
- Oh, yes, of course.

584
00:43:40.192 --> 00:43:43.754
I understand that such occurrences
are all part of a nurse's experience.

585
00:43:43.929 --> 00:43:45.454
That's it exactly.

586
00:43:46.331 --> 00:43:49.426
Let me give you
a little friendly advice, my dear.

587
00:43:49.968 --> 00:43:53.803
The successful nurse
is the one who keeps her mouth shut.

588
00:43:54.573 --> 00:43:58.340
You see, we doctors have to do it.
It's part of our professional ethics.

589
00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:02.140
So naturally, we want nurses
whose discretion we can rely upon.

590
00:44:02.314 --> 00:44:04.476
I realize that now.

591
00:44:04.883 --> 00:44:08.115
Good. Come on, run along, now,
back to your case.

592
00:44:08.286 --> 00:44:10.317
I'm sure everything's going
to be pleasant.

593
00:44:10.504 --> 00:44:12.247
You're generous to keep me on.

594
00:44:12.391 --> 00:44:15.384
Since we understand
each other, Miss Hart...

595
00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.995
...I shall probably have
considerable work for you.

596
00:44:18.163 --> 00:44:21.691
- Oh, do you think so?
- I like your spirit.

597
00:44:21.867 --> 00:44:25.326
Just put it to use in the interest
of your doctor, can you?

598
00:44:25.504 --> 00:44:27.166
I think I can.

599
00:44:27.339 --> 00:44:31.401
- Good afternoon, doctor.
- Good afternoon, Miss Hart.

600
00:44:34.913 --> 00:44:37.974
How do you do?
I was told you wished to see me.

601
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:41.052
Oh, yes, I have wanted
to talk with you...

602
00:44:41.219 --> 00:44:42.744
...but, oh, my head hurt so.

603
00:44:42.921 --> 00:44:45.447
I hope it feels better now.

604
00:44:45.624 --> 00:44:50.062
You know, if people only knew
the tortures of neurasthenia...

605
00:44:50.228 --> 00:44:52.663
...they'd forgive us everything.

606
00:44:52.831 --> 00:44:56.529
You see, Dr. Ranger
forgot to send my bromides.

607
00:44:56.701 --> 00:44:58.135
Oh.

608
00:44:58.303 --> 00:45:01.603
I do hope you weren't too upset
by the conduct of the chauffeur.

609
00:45:02.974 --> 00:45:04.966
You know--
Now, listen, Poochie, stop that.

610
00:45:05.143 --> 00:45:08.136
You know, we discovered,
for some strange reason...

611
00:45:08.313 --> 00:45:12.842
...that Nick seems to irritate me
less than any of the other servants.

612
00:45:13.018 --> 00:45:19.515
So as far as feasible, Dr. Ranger
wanted him to be my personal attendant.

613
00:45:19.958 --> 00:45:21.517
Well, we'll just forget about it.

614
00:45:21.993 --> 00:45:26.158
I'm sure you understand
how much I'm depending upon you.

615
00:45:26.331 --> 00:45:29.768
I'll do everything I can
to help the children. Is that all?

616
00:45:29.935 --> 00:45:32.905
- Oh, I want you to have this, Miss Hart.
- Why, I--

617
00:45:33.071 --> 00:45:36.803
Just a little appreciation
of your tactful conduct.

618
00:45:36.975 --> 00:45:39.501
Oh, thank you very much. Is that all?

619
00:45:39.678 --> 00:45:42.842
I'll be sending for you soon.

620
00:45:50.989 --> 00:45:54.187
Well, Poochie,
now we can have a drink, huh?

621
00:46:01.933 --> 00:46:03.799
Well, what'd she want?

622
00:46:03.969 --> 00:46:06.268
- Gee, a hundred bucks.
- Yeah, isn't that a scream?

623
00:46:06.438 --> 00:46:08.498
Hey, don't handle it like it's rubber.

624
00:46:08.673 --> 00:46:10.869
I won't get very much kick
out of spending it.

625
00:46:11.042 --> 00:46:14.809
Listen, belle, for a hundred bucks,
I'd take a couple of socks on the chin.

626
00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:16.972
Funny what people think money will do.

627
00:46:17.149 --> 00:46:21.211
Keeping our nose out of patients' private
affairs is part of our professional ethics.

628
00:46:21.386 --> 00:46:23.651
I'll kill the next one
that says "ethics" to me.

629
00:46:23.822 --> 00:46:26.951
- Says you.
- Yeah, says me in a big way, sister.

630
00:46:34.332 --> 00:46:35.925
Will you make this up for me?

631
00:46:36.101 --> 00:46:38.297
For the little girls, eh?
Are they any better?

632
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:39.768
I wish I thought so.

633
00:46:39.938 --> 00:46:42.066
My pal.

634
00:46:42.641 --> 00:46:46.134
Well, of all the places.
And drinking a soda too.

635
00:46:46.311 --> 00:46:48.143
Why not? Have one?

636
00:46:48.313 --> 00:46:49.975
Why not?

637
00:46:50.148 --> 00:46:52.447
- One of the same.
- Yes, sir.

638
00:46:53.552 --> 00:46:58.388
- How's your friend's hand?
- Oh, fine.

639
00:46:58.557 --> 00:47:00.549
Good as new.

640
00:47:00.725 --> 00:47:03.889
- Say, you're looking pretty hot yourself.
- Thanks.

641
00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:13.630
Hey, where'd you get that?

642
00:47:15.674 --> 00:47:17.233
Looks like somebody took a swing.

643
00:47:17.409 --> 00:47:20.174
Oh, a chauffeur
at the place where I work got fresh.

644
00:47:20.345 --> 00:47:22.439
He socked you? On the level?

645
00:47:22.614 --> 00:47:24.640
Well, not exactly on the level.

646
00:47:24.816 --> 00:47:27.547
From a way down here someplace.

647
00:47:27.719 --> 00:47:29.085
Why, the dirty....

648
00:47:29.254 --> 00:47:31.382
- I'll get him.
- What do you mean?

649
00:47:31.556 --> 00:47:34.685
Say, listen. I know a couple of guys
who'll do it as a pleasure.

650
00:47:34.859 --> 00:47:37.556
- You wouldn't do anything like that?
- I don't do a thing...

651
00:47:37.729 --> 00:47:40.392
...but tell a couple of guys
I don't like this bozo.

652
00:47:41.166 --> 00:47:44.432
- Anyhow, you don't know who he is.
- All you gotta do is tell me.

653
00:47:44.603 --> 00:47:48.301
I should say not.
I don't want you getting in a jam over me.

654
00:47:48.974 --> 00:47:51.739
There's nobody
I'd rather get in a jam over.

655
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:55.403
Well, maybe there's nobody
I'd rather keep out of a jam.

656
00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:57.947
- Honest?
- Maybe.

657
00:47:58.116 --> 00:48:00.210
I tried to get you at the hospital.

658
00:48:00.385 --> 00:48:01.910
Oh, I'm on private duty now.

659
00:48:01.991 --> 00:48:03.111
- Nights?
- Mm-hm.

660
00:48:03.148 --> 00:48:05.006
Then how about a buggy ride
some afternoon?

661
00:48:05.123 --> 00:48:06.955
Nurses have reputations.

662
00:48:07.125 --> 00:48:09.458
Oh, I see.

663
00:48:09.794 --> 00:48:12.593
What would you say if I told you
I'd quit the racket?

664
00:48:13.098 --> 00:48:15.658
- I'd say I didn't believe you.
- Well, I did.

665
00:48:15.834 --> 00:48:17.427
A month ago.

666
00:48:17.602 --> 00:48:20.401
So how about a ride some afternoon?
Tomorrow afternoon.

667
00:48:21.273 --> 00:48:23.765
- What do you say?
- I'd like to, but I hadn't better.

668
00:48:23.942 --> 00:48:27.242
Oh, come on. I've been crazy to see you
ever since that night.

669
00:48:27.412 --> 00:48:28.539
When I go riding...

670
00:48:28.713 --> 00:48:31.512
...it isn't gonna be with anybody
that's liable to get shot.

671
00:48:31.683 --> 00:48:35.245
- But I tell you I'm all washed up.
- And I tell you I don't believe you.

672
00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.048
On the level, sister.

673
00:48:37.756 --> 00:48:40.988
Hey, you.
Those two mugs won't wait forever.

674
00:48:41.159 --> 00:48:43.594
Okay, I'm coming.

675
00:48:43.928 --> 00:48:46.420
- Say, we're just going to see the fights.
- Mm-hm.

676
00:48:46.598 --> 00:48:48.260
Honest.

677
00:48:48.433 --> 00:48:50.459
I'll find you sometime
and prove I'm on the level.

678
00:48:50.635 --> 00:48:53.104
- Hmm.
- So long, sister.

679
00:49:12.691 --> 00:49:14.819
- How is she?
- She dozed off at last.

680
00:49:14.993 --> 00:49:16.325
Oh, thank goodness.

681
00:49:16.494 --> 00:49:18.793
Say, when did you take
to worrying so much?

682
00:49:18.963 --> 00:49:21.432
I didn't realize it was so serious.

683
00:49:21.599 --> 00:49:25.058
It's sort of gotten
on my nerves lately.

684
00:49:25.236 --> 00:49:27.068
It's about time.

685
00:49:27.238 --> 00:49:31.266
And I heard something yesterday
that I didn't like.

686
00:49:31.443 --> 00:49:32.672
What?

687
00:49:32.844 --> 00:49:37.339
Well, I'll tell you about it
when I'm sure it's true.

688
00:49:37.849 --> 00:49:42.810
Lora's late again. She would be.
Every time I've had a decent date.

689
00:49:43.588 --> 00:49:46.353
I think I'll blow and let you watch
the kids till she comes.

690
00:49:46.524 --> 00:49:48.823
Oh, you mustn't,
with Nanny as low as she is.

691
00:49:48.993 --> 00:49:52.725
- I wouldn't know what to do.
- Keep your chemise on, I didn't mean it.

692
00:49:52.897 --> 00:49:55.366
If she wakes up,
hadn't we better try paregoric?

693
00:49:55.533 --> 00:49:58.332
A lot of good that'll do
if she can't retain a Murphy drip.

694
00:49:58.503 --> 00:50:02.304
Oh, I wish Dr. Ranger would come.
He'd know what to do.

695
00:50:02.474 --> 00:50:04.534
Yeah. He would, all right.

696
00:50:04.709 --> 00:50:08.703
I wish you'd try a milk bath.
My sister Edna saved her baby that way.

697
00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:12.180
- She did, I tell you, I was there.
- Well, let's not go into that again.

698
00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:15.548
- But if it worked once--
- It was a mistake.

699
00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:17.484
Well, it's about time.

700
00:50:17.655 --> 00:50:19.089
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

701
00:50:19.187 --> 00:50:20.216
Where've you been?

702
00:50:20.311 --> 00:50:22.308
That rich boyfriend of mine
is waiting again.

703
00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:24.986
Is that so?
I just saw Eagan downstairs.

704
00:50:25.163 --> 00:50:27.632
He tried to duck, but I saw him.

705
00:50:28.133 --> 00:50:31.001
I thought you was out delivering gin
with that crush of yours.

706
00:50:31.169 --> 00:50:34.105
I haven't seen him but once
since that night in the drugstore.

707
00:50:34.272 --> 00:50:37.401
Say, look, won't Nanny love that?

708
00:50:38.076 --> 00:50:39.874
Not the way she was feeling today.

709
00:50:40.044 --> 00:50:42.843
- Is she worse?
- Yeah, took a nosedive.

710
00:50:43.014 --> 00:50:45.074
I had to send Desney
to Mrs. Maxwell's room.

711
00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:48.277
- Nanny can't keep anything down or up.
- Did you try a Murphy drip?

712
00:50:48.453 --> 00:50:51.184
- Mm-hm.
- Oh, the poor little baby.

713
00:50:53.658 --> 00:50:56.059
- Have you called Dr. Ranger?
- Yeah, I can't get him.

714
00:50:56.227 --> 00:50:58.662
He's in Jersey on a case.

715
00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:00.822
Well, I've done all I can do
without orders.

716
00:51:00.999 --> 00:51:05.937
You could give her a milk bath.
My sister saved her baby with one.

717
00:51:06.104 --> 00:51:09.131
You've got her started again.
Well, good night, kid.

718
00:51:09.307 --> 00:51:11.902
And good luck.
And if you need me, give me a ring.

719
00:51:12.076 --> 00:51:13.635
All right.

720
00:51:16.481 --> 00:51:18.575
Why won't you try a milk bath?

721
00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:21.083
She couldn't absorb nourishment
through her pores.

722
00:51:21.252 --> 00:51:23.380
But she might. We could try.

723
00:51:23.555 --> 00:51:27.117
Oh, I didn't realize it was this serious.

724
00:51:27.292 --> 00:51:32.959
- Poor kids, the way we treated them.
- Shh. You'll wake her.

725
00:51:35.633 --> 00:51:38.262
Nanny. Nanny.

726
00:51:38.436 --> 00:51:40.564
Look what I brought you.

727
00:52:04.863 --> 00:52:08.356
Pardon me.
Could you tell me where Mrs. Ritchey is?

728
00:52:08.533 --> 00:52:10.365
Say, what's going on here?

729
00:52:10.535 --> 00:52:12.766
- A costume party?
- Well, as I live and breathe.

730
00:52:12.937 --> 00:52:14.269
Now, wait a minute. Hold on--

731
00:52:14.439 --> 00:52:15.930
Control yourself, big boy.

732
00:52:16.107 --> 00:52:18.133
- You don't know her.
- Yes, I do.

733
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:21.438
One time, I had a pain and the doctor
put a big cone over my face...

734
00:52:21.613 --> 00:52:23.343
...and told me to take a deep breath.

735
00:52:23.515 --> 00:52:25.746
And I did and I floated right up
through the cone...

736
00:52:25.917 --> 00:52:28.751
...and when I came out the other end,
there she was.

737
00:52:35.827 --> 00:52:38.490
- What have we here?
- Why, it's little Miss Iodine herself.

738
00:52:38.663 --> 00:52:41.326
Do you know where I can find Mrs. Ritchey?
It's important.

739
00:52:41.499 --> 00:52:44.230
Well, if you're soliciting for a hospital,
you're too soon.

740
00:52:44.402 --> 00:52:46.098
Mrs. Ritchey won't need you till morning.

741
00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:58.478
- Do you belong here?
- Yes. Do you know where Mrs. Ritchey is?

742
00:52:58.650 --> 00:53:00.175
She's the latest innovation.

743
00:53:00.351 --> 00:53:03.617
All the newest household bars
have attachable sick nurses.

744
00:53:05.456 --> 00:53:07.948
What's known as
the morning-after pickup.

745
00:53:08.126 --> 00:53:09.754
Pickup, yeah, whatever.

746
00:53:16.834 --> 00:53:20.100
Mack, go back and be barkeeper.

747
00:53:20.271 --> 00:53:23.730
- Ah, shut up.
- Go back and be barkeeper.

748
00:53:23.908 --> 00:53:25.809
Tishy wants a drink.

749
00:53:26.844 --> 00:53:31.248
- Oh, Tishy wants a drink, Mack.
- Mrs. Ritchey. Mrs. Ritchey.

750
00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:35.110
- What?
- I wanna speak to you.

751
00:53:35.286 --> 00:53:39.087
Yeah? Well, go back of the bar
and give Tishy a little drink.

752
00:53:39.490 --> 00:53:42.483
Nanny is very ill. You must come up
to the nursery with me.

753
00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:45.186
- What?
- Nanny is dangerously ill.

754
00:53:45.897 --> 00:53:47.229
Oh, you're crazy.

755
00:53:47.398 --> 00:53:50.800
Oh, Mrs. Ritchey, I wouldn't come here
if it wasn't absolutely necessary.

756
00:53:50.969 --> 00:53:54.337
Don't you understand?
Nanny is almost dying.

757
00:53:54.505 --> 00:53:58.101
- It's my duty to make you come.
- Ridiculous.

758
00:53:58.276 --> 00:54:02.145
Dr. Ranger is a grand...

759
00:54:02.313 --> 00:54:05.306
...splendid, magnificent doctor.

760
00:54:05.483 --> 00:54:10.012
He's a magnificent doctor.
Says she's almost well.

761
00:54:10.188 --> 00:54:11.781
Don't be silly.

762
00:54:11.956 --> 00:54:14.425
Dr. Ranger hasn't been near her
for two days.

763
00:54:14.592 --> 00:54:17.960
She's sinking very low.
You've got to come with me.

764
00:54:18.129 --> 00:54:19.563
Shh.

765
00:54:19.731 --> 00:54:25.295
Utter confidence in Dr. Ranger.
He's a magnificent doctor.

766
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:28.634
A marvelous doctor.

767
00:54:28.806 --> 00:54:32.265
Says you're an alarmist, an alarmist.

768
00:54:38.516 --> 00:54:40.747
He says that I can't see the children...

769
00:54:40.918 --> 00:54:46.118
...because it makes them so nervous
and so upset.

770
00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:49.886
Oh, don't you understand?
Nanny is dying.

771
00:54:50.061 --> 00:54:55.432
Oh, go back of the bar
and give Tishy a little drink.

772
00:54:56.501 --> 00:55:02.907
- Mack, give Tishy a little drink.
- Who says I am?

773
00:55:06.477 --> 00:55:10.915
Oh, hello. I remember you.

774
00:55:11.249 --> 00:55:12.808
What are you waving at?

775
00:55:12.984 --> 00:55:15.419
You get out of here. He's mine.

776
00:55:15.586 --> 00:55:17.452
You get out of here.

777
00:55:17.622 --> 00:55:21.787
Dr. Ranger's a stupendous doctor.

778
00:55:21.959 --> 00:55:25.623
And I love my big boy.

779
00:55:28.332 --> 00:55:31.825
Don't stand there staring at me like that.

780
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:35.468
I'm a dipsomaniac and I'm proud of it.

781
00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:39.099
You hear?
I'm a dipsomaniac and I like it.

782
00:55:39.277 --> 00:55:42.509
- I like it. How do you like that?
- You're a cruel, inhuman mother.

783
00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:43.909
I'm a dipsomaniac--

784
00:55:44.082 --> 00:55:45.948
You're a rotten parasite, that's what.

785
00:55:46.117 --> 00:55:48.052
Don't blame it on the booze. It's you.

786
00:55:48.219 --> 00:55:51.519
Why do poor little children
have to be born to women like you?

787
00:55:51.689 --> 00:55:53.419
- How can I--?
- Shut up!

788
00:55:53.591 --> 00:55:55.355
Mack, don't let her hurt my feelings--

789
00:55:55.526 --> 00:55:59.019
You're going up in that nursery
if I have to drag you by the hair.

790
00:55:59.197 --> 00:56:01.996
Let go! Mack, stop her.

791
00:56:02.166 --> 00:56:05.568
Here, here, here. Just a minute, now.

792
00:56:05.737 --> 00:56:10.198
Don't you realize that
you're getting poor little miss all upset?

793
00:56:10.374 --> 00:56:12.240
Oh, yeah?

794
00:56:17.882 --> 00:56:19.180
Say, you can't....

795
00:56:28.693 --> 00:56:30.662
- Come on, now.
- Stop it, let go of me.

796
00:56:30.828 --> 00:56:35.493
- I say stop it. Stop.
- Oh, snap out of it.

797
00:56:35.867 --> 00:56:39.360
- Stay on your feet.
- Let me alone.

798
00:56:44.208 --> 00:56:46.336
You mother.

799
00:56:58.389 --> 00:57:00.187
Say, you can't do that.

800
00:57:12.036 --> 00:57:13.868
Bye-bye.

801
00:57:21.412 --> 00:57:23.938
Grand 2311.

802
00:57:24.816 --> 00:57:27.217
Hello, is Dr. Bell there?

803
00:57:28.152 --> 00:57:33.216
Oh. Well, do you know where I can
find him? I'm Lora Hart, a nurse.

804
00:57:33.391 --> 00:57:35.883
It's very important.

805
00:57:36.427 --> 00:57:38.987
Will he be at the hospital?

806
00:57:41.065 --> 00:57:44.399
When does he come in, tell him
Miss Hart wants him to come at once.

807
00:57:44.569 --> 00:57:48.973
Tell him it's vital, because I can't
find Dr. Ranger. Thank you.

808
00:57:54.545 --> 00:57:56.514
Hey, sister, where can I find Nick?

809
00:58:00.418 --> 00:58:02.114
Hello.

810
00:58:03.521 --> 00:58:06.184
- Where'd you come from?
- I'm delivering.

811
00:58:07.325 --> 00:58:08.918
I thought you quit.

812
00:58:09.527 --> 00:58:13.623
Oh, well,
I guess I kind of exaggerated.

813
00:58:14.465 --> 00:58:17.993
- Say, are you working here?
- Yes.

814
00:58:19.036 --> 00:58:21.665
And one of my little patients is dying.

815
00:58:23.307 --> 00:58:25.469
Say, you might help me.

816
00:58:25.643 --> 00:58:27.805
- Well, if I can do anything....
- Come with me.

817
00:58:27.979 --> 00:58:30.972
Say, is this the dump
you got the crack on the chin?

818
00:58:31.148 --> 00:58:34.516
- That doesn't matter now.
- Was Nick the guy?

819
00:58:35.186 --> 00:58:38.247
I've got to think of this little child
and you've got to help me.

820
00:58:38.422 --> 00:58:39.788
Okay, sister.

821
00:58:39.957 --> 00:58:41.152
Dr. Bell wasn't in.

822
00:58:41.325 --> 00:58:45.319
- Oh, what'll we do? What can we do?
- Just wait for Dr. Bell, that's all.

823
00:58:45.496 --> 00:58:48.193
No use sending for an ambulance,
Nanny couldn't be moved.

824
00:58:48.366 --> 00:58:50.858
- Say, who is this Bell guy?
- Arthur Bell, the surgeon.

825
00:58:51.035 --> 00:58:53.197
Maybe I can find him.
I know a couple of guys--

826
00:58:53.371 --> 00:58:55.306
How could you find him? Nobody can.

827
00:58:55.473 --> 00:58:58.739
I wish for once you'd stop acting
as though you knew everything.

828
00:58:59.176 --> 00:59:02.544
- Can't we try a milk bath?
- Oh, that wouldn't do any good.

829
00:59:02.713 --> 00:59:05.148
That's what saved my sister's baby.

830
00:59:05.783 --> 00:59:07.906
It's a crazy idea,
but we'll try anything.

831
00:59:08.032 --> 00:59:08.969
Oh, thank God.

832
00:59:09.082 --> 00:59:13.452
But I'll need milk.
Ten, 12, 15 quarts of it.

833
00:59:13.557 --> 00:59:14.581
Can you get it?

834
00:59:15.092 --> 00:59:18.585
- Why, where do you buy milk?
- In a grocery, a delicatessen.

835
00:59:18.763 --> 00:59:21.096
- Oh, I get you.
- Now, hurry, bootlegger.

836
00:59:21.265 --> 00:59:23.359
This has gotta be
the fastest delivery ever.

837
00:59:23.534 --> 00:59:26.663
Okay, sister.
I know a couple of guys--

838
01:00:31.035 --> 01:00:32.059
Bootlegger.

839
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:34.329
Come in here, will you?

840
01:00:42.113 --> 01:00:43.513
Where are you?

841
01:00:47.952 --> 01:00:51.480
Where's he gone?
Where's our bootlegger?

842
01:00:51.655 --> 01:00:56.150
He left 10 minutes ago.
He won't be back.

843
01:00:56.327 --> 01:00:58.922
That's what's wrong with Prohibition.

844
01:00:59.563 --> 01:01:02.590
Oh, I wish I could find
one of those doctors.

845
01:01:04.235 --> 01:01:07.672
Don't get Ranger. I don't like him.

846
01:01:09.273 --> 01:01:11.674
- You don't?
- No more.

847
01:01:11.842 --> 01:01:16.871
- Why not?
- Had my suspicions confirmed.

848
01:01:18.349 --> 01:01:20.443
What suspicions?

849
01:01:21.052 --> 01:01:22.486
What suspicions?

850
01:01:24.021 --> 01:01:26.388
I heard, on the telephone....

851
01:01:26.557 --> 01:01:29.493
What did you hear? Tell me.

852
01:01:30.127 --> 01:01:35.566
- I heard what I heard.
- Oh, talk to me.

853
01:01:35.733 --> 01:01:39.431
What did you hear? What about Ranger?

854
01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:42.365
Not talking about him yet.

855
01:01:43.007 --> 01:01:43.789
It isn't time.

856
01:01:43.814 --> 01:01:46.160
Oh, it is time,
if it concerns those kids.

857
01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:50.372
Will you talk to me?
It's about Nick, isn't it?

858
01:01:50.915 --> 01:01:54.408
I heard him talking to Dr. Ranger.

859
01:01:54.585 --> 01:01:57.214
All right, you heard him
talking to Dr. Ranger.

860
01:01:57.388 --> 01:01:59.823
- What did he say?
- To Dr. Ranger.

861
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:05.361
Oh, will you pay attention to me?
What did Nick say to Dr. Ranger?

862
01:02:07.031 --> 01:02:11.025
Nick don't want people to see her
when she's drunk.

863
01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:16.404
- Judge will take away the trust fund.
- Trust fund?

864
01:02:16.574 --> 01:02:18.440
I had my suspicions.

865
01:02:18.609 --> 01:02:21.636
Is Mrs. Ritchey in charge
of the children's trust fund?

866
01:02:21.812 --> 01:02:23.440
Mm-hm.

867
01:02:26.450 --> 01:02:28.578
So that's what they're after.

868
01:02:33.757 --> 01:02:35.919
What's all the noise?

869
01:02:37.094 --> 01:02:41.794
Nick, you let us alone.
Nanny's terribly sick.

870
01:02:41.966 --> 01:02:43.958
Ah, shut up.

871
01:02:45.903 --> 01:02:47.735
What are you up to with that kid?

872
01:02:47.905 --> 01:02:50.568
I'm keeping her resting easily
until a doctor comes.

873
01:02:50.741 --> 01:02:53.973
- Have you anything to say about that?
- Depends on how you're doing it.

874
01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:57.013
- I'm giving her a milk bath.
- Dr. Ranger tell you to?

875
01:02:57.181 --> 01:03:01.551
No, I can't find Dr. Ranger.
Strange, isn't it?

876
01:03:02.386 --> 01:03:04.184
Nothing's gonna be done
without orders.

877
01:03:04.355 --> 01:03:07.917
Then you get Ranger here so we can
place the responsibility where it belongs.

878
01:03:08.092 --> 01:03:10.220
- I'm responsible when he ain't here.
- I'll say.

879
01:03:10.394 --> 01:03:14.195
- And I want Ranger's orders carried out.
- You'll be responsible for a lot more.

880
01:03:14.365 --> 01:03:15.731
Oh, yeah?

881
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.334
They use electric chairs for the kind
of things you're responsible for.

882
01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:21.998
Hey, just what's the idea
behind that crack?

883
01:03:22.173 --> 01:03:24.972
Don't you think I know
deliberate malpractice when I see it?

884
01:03:25.142 --> 01:03:28.635
- You're speaking right out, ain't you?
- Yeah, and I'll make it even plainer.

885
01:03:28.812 --> 01:03:31.077
In your case,
I'm talking about murder.

886
01:03:31.248 --> 01:03:33.308
Why, you little--

887
01:03:35.452 --> 01:03:38.513
Keep your bean. If you don't like
what Ranger's doing, talk to him.

888
01:03:38.689 --> 01:03:42.091
- Don't bring me in.
- You're in already, plenty.

889
01:03:42.259 --> 01:03:45.991
If this baby dies,
you're in with Ranger.

890
01:03:46.697 --> 01:03:48.165
Spill it, now. Come on.

891
01:03:48.332 --> 01:03:50.767
How long did you think
you could get away with this?

892
01:03:50.935 --> 01:03:55.236
You think because you strong-arm women,
you have the brains to put this over?

893
01:03:55.406 --> 01:03:57.568
I had your number
the minute I stepped in.

894
01:03:57.741 --> 01:04:00.006
And I've reported my suspicions
on the outside.

895
01:04:00.177 --> 01:04:03.375
- Oh, yeah? Spit them out.
- You want those kids to die.

896
01:04:03.547 --> 01:04:05.607
- Yeah?
- You want what their father left them.

897
01:04:05.783 --> 01:04:08.776
That's why you keep the mother
full of booze all the time.

898
01:04:08.953 --> 01:04:11.980
You'll take her out and marry her
and grab the trust fund.

899
01:04:12.156 --> 01:04:16.719
- You're not gonna get away with it.
- Who said there was a trust fund?

900
01:04:24.868 --> 01:04:28.270
So you've been shooting off
your nutty ideas, huh?

901
01:04:28.439 --> 01:04:32.206
- Get out.
- Nick, you be careful, now.

902
01:04:32.376 --> 01:04:34.072
Get out!

903
01:04:38.249 --> 01:04:41.583
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

904
01:04:44.822 --> 01:04:46.450
No, Nick.

905
01:04:53.097 --> 01:04:56.727
- Now I'll tell you a few things.
- Beating me up won't get you any place.

906
01:05:14.285 --> 01:05:16.686
Poor little Nanny.

907
01:05:17.454 --> 01:05:20.652
Nobody cares whether you live or die.

908
01:05:21.725 --> 01:05:24.058
Gee, if you could only hear me.

909
01:05:24.828 --> 01:05:27.957
I can.
And I'm certainly glad I'm here.

910
01:05:28.132 --> 01:05:32.331
- Doctor, you did get my message.
- No, I didn't get any message from you.

911
01:05:32.503 --> 01:05:35.405
But from a strange man,
a most extraordinary fellow.

912
01:05:35.572 --> 01:05:36.596
What man?

913
01:05:37.508 --> 01:05:40.000
He said if I couldn't
see my way clear getting here...

914
01:05:40.177 --> 01:05:44.080
...he'd call around some evening with
a couple of friends and take me for a ride.

915
01:05:44.248 --> 01:05:48.015
- Did he say that?
- Yes, he did.

916
01:05:48.185 --> 01:05:51.280
And I didn't like
the way he said it, either.

917
01:05:51.755 --> 01:05:54.623
- Now, what's the trouble here?
- Oh, she's low, doctor.

918
01:05:54.792 --> 01:05:56.556
Very low.

919
01:06:01.598 --> 01:06:05.399
- Do you think there's anything we can do?
- Only one thing.

920
01:06:05.836 --> 01:06:08.101
- A blood transfusion, and in a hurry.
- Take mine.

921
01:06:08.272 --> 01:06:10.741
I'm type 4A. I've been typed.

922
01:06:10.908 --> 01:06:13.537
- But we don't know the baby's type.
- I know it, it's 4A.

923
01:06:13.711 --> 01:06:15.509
Oh, doctor, we've got to hurry.

924
01:06:15.679 --> 01:06:16.942
Who's got to hurry?

925
01:06:19.583 --> 01:06:22.178
- Who are you?
- It's Nick, the chauffeur.

926
01:06:22.353 --> 01:06:24.049
Oh, yeah.

927
01:06:27.925 --> 01:06:28.984
I'm Dr. Bell.

928
01:06:29.159 --> 01:06:31.924
We're about to give a transfusion
and I ask you to keep out.

929
01:06:32.096 --> 01:06:34.258
You're not on this case.
You better get out.

930
01:06:34.431 --> 01:06:36.627
Now, listen,
this is a matter of life and death.

931
01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:40.635
- I'd run along if I was you.
- Oh, I can't be bothered with you-- Oh!

932
01:06:40.804 --> 01:06:43.603
Oh, you dirty, lousy--

933
01:06:43.974 --> 01:06:45.499
Oh!

934
01:06:46.243 --> 01:06:48.235
Hey, you.

935
01:06:49.747 --> 01:06:53.707
Yeah, I mean you. Get out of here.

936
01:07:00.124 --> 01:07:02.684
Come on, and make it snappy.

937
01:07:32.289 --> 01:07:36.226
That's a good girl. Splendid.

938
01:07:37.995 --> 01:07:41.329
Oh, I-- Did I wake you? I'm sorry.

939
01:07:41.498 --> 01:07:43.797
- How do you feel?
- All right, I guess.

940
01:07:43.967 --> 01:07:48.462
- How's Nanny?
- She's responded beautifully.

941
01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.241
She'll pull out of it this time.

942
01:07:53.777 --> 01:07:57.771
- Hello, Nanny.
- Hello, Lora.

943
01:08:03.954 --> 01:08:06.788
Daylight. My goodness,
have I been asleep that long?

944
01:08:06.957 --> 01:08:09.825
Yes, and a good thing too.

945
01:08:10.127 --> 01:08:12.596
You better go right home
and go back to bed.

946
01:08:12.763 --> 01:08:15.392
Losing all that blood
can make you feel pretty miserable.

947
01:08:15.566 --> 01:08:18.161
I can't. I have to hurry
and get dressed.

948
01:08:18.335 --> 01:08:20.930
- I'm going to the police station first.
- Police?

949
01:08:21.104 --> 01:08:25.041
Can't you see?
I've got all the proof I need now.

950
01:08:26.009 --> 01:08:28.945
And I'm going to the bat for you.

951
01:08:29.112 --> 01:08:31.172
Gee, doctor, you're swell.

952
01:08:32.516 --> 01:08:35.816
No, just sleepy.

953
01:08:53.770 --> 01:08:55.363
Cuckoo.

954
01:08:55.539 --> 01:08:57.667
Oh. You.

955
01:08:57.841 --> 01:08:59.241
Ah, go on, let me in, will you?

956
01:08:59.409 --> 01:09:02.743
You know me, I've been here before.
Tony knows me too.

957
01:09:02.913 --> 01:09:05.508
- Hey, what are you trying to pull?
- Nothing.

958
01:09:05.682 --> 01:09:08.880
Only, you make any joint
look like a speakeasy.

959
01:09:10.254 --> 01:09:13.122
- Oh, Dr. Bell.
- Take good care of Nanny, Maloney.

960
01:09:13.290 --> 01:09:16.351
She's had a blood transfusion.
Keep in touch with me every hour.

961
01:09:16.527 --> 01:09:17.790
Well, how about Dr. Ranger?

962
01:09:17.969 --> 01:09:19.969
I'm going to settle
with him once and for all.

963
01:09:20.062 --> 01:09:22.000
I'm going to engage
a new night nurse.

964
01:09:22.065 --> 01:09:24.261
A night nurse?
What's the matter with you?

965
01:09:24.434 --> 01:09:27.370
Well, it's a certainty Mrs. Ritchey
will not want Lora around...

966
01:09:27.538 --> 01:09:29.837
...after she learns what Lora
has decided to do.

967
01:09:30.407 --> 01:09:33.809
- Are you gonna sign a warrant?
- If it's the last thing I ever do.

968
01:09:33.977 --> 01:09:36.276
Don't be a fool.
You'll never get another job.

969
01:09:36.446 --> 01:09:40.042
One jam like this and even
the patients are leery of you.

970
01:09:42.386 --> 01:09:44.651
Will you give me a lift downtown?
I'm in a hurry.

971
01:09:44.821 --> 01:09:47.791
Give you a lift?
I've been waiting for the chance.

972
01:09:49.693 --> 01:09:51.161
Well, how about a date tonight?

973
01:09:51.328 --> 01:09:55.197
You're not much to look at, but you do have
a way of showing up when you're needed.

974
01:09:55.365 --> 01:09:57.732
- Come here.
- By the way, what's your name?

975
01:09:57.901 --> 01:09:59.164
- Mortie.
- Glad to meet you.

976
01:09:59.336 --> 01:10:01.965
- Mine's Lora Hart.
- It's the last name I like.

977
01:10:02.139 --> 01:10:04.108
You won't be able to drive
with one arm.

978
01:10:04.274 --> 01:10:08.769
Sure I will. When I say shift, shift.

979
01:10:10.147 --> 01:10:11.672
Shift.

980
01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:16.084
Hey, stupe, look where you're going.

981
01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:18.989
Try again.

982
01:10:22.025 --> 01:10:23.653
- Happy?
- Uh-huh.

983
01:10:23.827 --> 01:10:25.625
- But there's one thing.
- What?

984
01:10:25.796 --> 01:10:29.255
I hate to think of Nick being arrested
and that dirt coming out in court...

985
01:10:29.433 --> 01:10:31.925
...on account of those little kids.

986
01:10:42.846 --> 01:10:44.439
You know, I've just been thinking.

987
01:10:44.615 --> 01:10:46.743
- Maybe Nick won't be arrested.
- Why not?

988
01:10:46.917 --> 01:10:48.818
I ain't seen him around since last night.

989
01:10:48.986 --> 01:10:50.784
- Think he's run away?
- No.

990
01:10:50.954 --> 01:10:54.447
- Well, what do you think?
- I ain't got an idea.

991
01:10:54.625 --> 01:10:57.026
Only, I happened to be talking
to a couple of guys--

992
01:10:57.194 --> 01:10:59.527
- What difference does that make?
- Nothing.

993
01:10:59.696 --> 01:11:02.928
Only, I happened to mention
I didn't like Nick so good.

994
01:11:13.644 --> 01:11:16.705
- What is it, for us?
- Nope, for the morgue.

995
01:11:18.672 --> 01:11:21.024
Some guy got taken for a ride.

996
01:11:21.184 --> 01:11:22.550
Bootlegger?

997
01:11:22.719 --> 01:11:26.121
No, he was wearing
a chauffeur's uniform.

998
01:11:29.159 --> 01:11:30.718
Shift.
