1
00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:17.538
Tommy?

2
00:02:19.774 --> 00:02:22.510
Tommy, are you awake?

3
00:02:25.212 --> 00:02:27.882
I saw your missing boat outside.

4
00:02:29.817 --> 00:02:32.185
I'm gonna get it for you.

5
00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:36.323
Mrs. Summers.

6
00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:38.593
Are you sure I should go?

7
00:02:38.626 --> 00:02:40.260
I don't mind staying.

8
00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:42.697
No, it's fine.
You should go home.

9
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.464
I'll check on the kids later.

10
00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:46.400
Okay, Mrs. Summers.

11
00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:48.435
I'll see you tomorrow.

12
00:03:08.523 --> 00:03:10.290
There you are.

13
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.312
Rebecca?

14
00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:07.447
What are you doing?

15
00:04:18.793 --> 00:04:20.293
Sorry, Mom.

16
00:04:20.327 --> 00:04:22.295
I didn't mean...

17
00:04:27.068 --> 00:04:29.336
Mom?

18
00:05:23.724 --> 00:05:26.828
<i>Temagami. Temagami.</i>

19
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:29.362
<i>Temagami. Temagami...</i>

20
00:05:32.767 --> 00:05:35.102
Mom! Mom!

21
00:05:35.136 --> 00:05:37.404
Help!

22
00:06:00.628 --> 00:06:02.462
Brewers played extra innings

23
00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:03.998
with the Marlins yesterday.

24
00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:05.465
They fell in 12.

25
00:06:05.498 --> 00:06:07.001
One-one. Foul ball
up the first baseline,

26
00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:08.603
and it is two strikes.

27
00:06:08.636 --> 00:06:10.437
Brewers are eight and nine

28
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.607
in extra-inning games
so far this season.

29
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.642
Hoping to keep
that streak alive.

30
00:06:14.675 --> 00:06:16.978
Ray, they're ready for us.

31
00:06:24.685 --> 00:06:26.120
Dad.

32
00:06:26.153 --> 00:06:28.155
You okay?

33
00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:30.892
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

34
00:06:30.925 --> 00:06:32.894
I'll just give you a head start.

35
00:06:32.927 --> 00:06:34.795
I'll meet you inside.

36
00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:41.802
This has got every single thing
that you asked for.

37
00:06:41.836 --> 00:06:44.038
It has 24-hour emergency
call service.

38
00:06:44.071 --> 00:06:46.107
Right? Which is great.

39
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.743
It's got, uh,
single-level bedrooms.

40
00:06:48.776 --> 00:06:51.579
It's got bath-- All
the bathrooms have handrails.

41
00:06:51.612 --> 00:06:53.114
And you're just minutes away

42
00:06:53.147 --> 00:06:56.050
from one of the best medical
facilities in the Twin Cities.

43
00:06:56.083 --> 00:06:57.518
Yeah.

44
00:06:57.551 --> 00:06:59.053
It's... I mean,
it's really kind of

45
00:06:59.086 --> 00:07:00.922
a perfect lease for when you
just need a little extra help.

46
00:07:00.955 --> 00:07:02.023
Hey.

47
00:07:02.056 --> 00:07:03.524
Do you not like it?

48
00:07:03.557 --> 00:07:05.492
-Well, it's nice.
-Are you... are you looking

49
00:07:05.526 --> 00:07:07.995
for a place to throw
the ball around?

50
00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:10.197
Is there any chance
that you're gonna bring

51
00:07:10.231 --> 00:07:13.067
that Waller swing here
once you get better?

52
00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:16.704
I'm sorry.
I google all my clients,

53
00:07:16.737 --> 00:07:19.040
and it's just not every day
that I get a...

54
00:07:19.073 --> 00:07:21.142
a big-league third baseman.

55
00:07:21.175 --> 00:07:22.610
Yeah, no. I, um...

56
00:07:22.643 --> 00:07:24.578
I'm just focused
on getting better now

57
00:07:24.612 --> 00:07:25.947
and spending some time at home

58
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.782
-and being with family.
-Well, you know what?

59
00:07:27.815 --> 00:07:30.518
You can spend some of that
baseball money right here.

60
00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:32.987
You can't put a price
on peace of mind.

61
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.221
Yeah.

62
00:07:34.255 --> 00:07:35.623
Yeah, well, apparently,
here you can.

63
00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:37.224
It's 4,200 bucks.

64
00:07:37.258 --> 00:07:38.659
Oh, just...

65
00:07:38.693 --> 00:07:39.961
You know what? In the kitchen.

66
00:07:39.994 --> 00:07:40.995
Come here. I want to show you.

67
00:07:41.028 --> 00:07:42.730
There's this accessible design.

68
00:07:42.763 --> 00:07:44.799
And I don't know who did it,
but I think I want one myself.

69
00:07:44.832 --> 00:07:46.600
-I'll tell you that much.
-You guys like it or...

70
00:07:46.634 --> 00:07:48.602
-Yeah.
-I might be your neighbor.

71
00:08:24.271 --> 00:08:25.873
Uh, wait, wait. Honey, honey.

72
00:08:25.906 --> 00:08:27.241
-Wait, stop, stop.
Stop, stop, stop. -What?

73
00:08:27.274 --> 00:08:29.210
Honey, stop, stop, stop. Look.

74
00:08:29.243 --> 00:08:31.612
-Look. Look.
-Oh.

75
00:08:33.047 --> 00:08:35.182
Huh.

76
00:08:35.216 --> 00:08:36.717
I would've shown you this place,

77
00:08:36.751 --> 00:08:38.252
but it didn't really meet
your checklist.

78
00:08:38.285 --> 00:08:39.553
And this is not a rental, right?

79
00:08:39.587 --> 00:08:40.688
Oh, I know.

80
00:08:40.721 --> 00:08:42.189
-We were just curious.
-Okay.

81
00:08:42.223 --> 00:08:45.092
Right, well, it's only one owner
for the last couple decades.

82
00:08:45.126 --> 00:08:48.863
And, uh, you know, it needs
just a little work, I think.

83
00:08:48.896 --> 00:08:51.766
But it's not gonna be on the
market very long at this price.

84
00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:54.268
Oh, and you're in
a great school district

85
00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:55.636
with Harold Holt.

86
00:08:55.669 --> 00:08:56.904
That's where I start
in the fall.

87
00:08:56.937 --> 00:08:59.173
No, really?
Oh, I'm a proud alum myself.

88
00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:00.641
Go, Lake Trout.

89
00:09:01.976 --> 00:09:03.978
And, uh, what subject
do you teach there?

90
00:09:04.011 --> 00:09:05.846
Oh, no.
I'm just in the admin office

91
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.949
while I finish my degree online
for special education.

92
00:09:09.817 --> 00:09:11.652
Oh, good for you. Good for you.

93
00:09:11.685 --> 00:09:14.922
Well, it's never too late
to follow your dream.

94
00:09:16.957 --> 00:09:18.793
Yeah.

95
00:09:18.826 --> 00:09:22.329
Oh, my gosh.
This is amazing.

96
00:09:22.363 --> 00:09:24.698
What is that?
Oh, the fruit baskets.

97
00:09:24.732 --> 00:09:27.034
Where did Ray get off to?

98
00:09:27.068 --> 00:09:28.869
I didn't see him.

99
00:09:30.104 --> 00:09:31.739
There you are.

100
00:09:31.772 --> 00:09:33.140
Hey.

101
00:09:33.174 --> 00:09:35.042
There's a pool.

102
00:09:37.678 --> 00:09:39.980
I used to be scared of pools.

103
00:09:40.915 --> 00:09:43.684
My dad pushed me into
one of the training tanks

104
00:09:43.717 --> 00:09:45.352
at Fort Benning
when I was three.

105
00:09:45.386 --> 00:09:46.687
Mm-hmm.

106
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.355
Sink or swim.

107
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:50.791
I guess I swam.

108
00:09:52.726 --> 00:09:54.995
I always wanted a pool.

109
00:09:55.029 --> 00:09:57.331
When we were kids,
we used to go down the street,

110
00:09:57.364 --> 00:09:59.633
break into the KOA, go swimming.

111
00:09:59.667 --> 00:10:02.970
We used to pretend that we were
the rich kids from the suburbs.

112
00:10:04.338 --> 00:10:06.073
Hey, Mom, can we get lunch?

113
00:10:06.107 --> 00:10:08.375
Yeah, I'm ready to go.
Can we get some food?

114
00:10:08.409 --> 00:10:10.377
Mm. Come on, old man.

115
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:12.213
Before we get too nostalgic.

116
00:10:44.945 --> 00:10:46.347
<i>Familiar face makes his way</i>

117
00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.848
<i>down to the plate.</i>

118
00:10:47.882 --> 00:10:50.017
<i>What a story</i>
<i>this has been, folks.</i>

119
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.919
<i>After a year battling illness,</i>

120
00:10:51.952 --> 00:10:54.288
<i>Ray Waller is trying</i>
<i>to do the impossible</i>

121
00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:56.757
<i>with a Major League comeback.</i>

122
00:10:58.359 --> 00:10:59.460
<i>Slider inside.</i>

123
00:10:59.493 --> 00:11:01.695
<i>Waller digs for it...</i>

124
00:11:01.729 --> 00:11:03.464
<i>and connects!</i>

125
00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:05.733
<i>It's a deep ball</i>
<i>into far center field,</i>

126
00:11:05.766 --> 00:11:08.035
<i>and it is gone!</i>

127
00:11:22.316 --> 00:11:23.450
Dad!

128
00:11:23.484 --> 00:11:26.053
Mom, hurry! Dad fell in!

129
00:11:27.154 --> 00:11:29.323
Ray, what happened?
Are you okay?

130
00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:30.891
-Dad?
-Yeah.

131
00:11:30.925 --> 00:11:32.126
-What happened?
-Mom, is he okay?

132
00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:33.928
Just breathe.
It's okay. It's okay.

133
00:11:33.961 --> 00:11:35.863
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Mom, his cane. -Yep.

134
00:11:35.896 --> 00:11:38.065
-Izzy, give me... Help me here.
-Yep.

135
00:11:38.098 --> 00:11:39.500
-Yeah.
-You got it?

136
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.338
-You got it?
-Okay.

137
00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:46.373
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Okay.

138
00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:58.085
How long has it been
since your last episode?

139
00:11:58.118 --> 00:12:00.454
Um, well,
it wasn't really an episode,

140
00:12:00.487 --> 00:12:01.956
I don't think. It's like...

141
00:12:01.989 --> 00:12:03.857
At spring training
about six months ago.

142
00:12:03.891 --> 00:12:08.362
My recommendation
is to escalate the diagnosis

143
00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:11.498
to secondary progressive MS.

144
00:12:11.533 --> 00:12:14.034
No, but the doctor said
he was stabilizing

145
00:12:14.068 --> 00:12:16.837
and that it's about
managing now.

146
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.773
It's better to have
a more accurate diagnosis.

147
00:12:19.807 --> 00:12:21.308
Are you in PT?

148
00:12:21.342 --> 00:12:23.777
No, um, well, I mean,
I'm throwing the ball around

149
00:12:23.811 --> 00:12:25.513
in the front yard with
the kids, and, like, that...

150
00:12:25.547 --> 00:12:28.382
We just got insurance through
the school where I'm working.

151
00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:29.850
-Yeah.
-Forget baseball.

152
00:12:29.883 --> 00:12:32.987
For now, we need to find
a low-impact activity

153
00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.522
that you can do every day.

154
00:12:34.556 --> 00:12:37.024
Walking, yoga.

155
00:12:37.057 --> 00:12:39.927
Most therapists
recommend swimming.

156
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.996
Look, I know it feels like
your whole world

157
00:12:42.029 --> 00:12:44.298
is turning upside down.

158
00:12:44.331 --> 00:12:47.268
It's going to take sacrifice
from you both,

159
00:12:47.301 --> 00:12:49.537
but you can build a good life
together.

160
00:12:49.571 --> 00:12:52.373
First, you have to let go
of the old one.

161
00:12:53.907 --> 00:12:56.010
Use the wheelchair
for the next few days

162
00:12:56.043 --> 00:12:59.313
while you regulate, and I will
bring you back in next week.

163
00:13:04.051 --> 00:13:05.919
Honey, if we rent that townhome,

164
00:13:05.953 --> 00:13:08.122
it'd be like living
in a hospital.

165
00:13:10.592 --> 00:13:12.426
I don't want to be
the sick guy anymore.

166
00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:13.827
But you're sick, Ray.

167
00:13:13.861 --> 00:13:15.329
We need to deal with that
head-on.

168
00:13:15.362 --> 00:13:18.799
I know. I just don't want it
to define our whole life now.

169
00:13:19.634 --> 00:13:22.303
What about that other house?

170
00:13:22.336 --> 00:13:25.339
The kids will love it,
with all that room.

171
00:13:25.372 --> 00:13:26.608
And with a swimming pool,

172
00:13:26.641 --> 00:13:30.811
we'll have water therapy
in our own backyard.

173
00:13:40.988 --> 00:13:43.924
You know I want our own place.

174
00:13:43.957 --> 00:13:46.994
I'm tired of the kids
changing schools,

175
00:13:47.027 --> 00:13:50.064
making new friends
every time you get traded.

176
00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:55.102
I want us to put down roots,
you know?

177
00:13:55.135 --> 00:13:58.372
I just need to know

Yeah.

235
00:16:22.416 --> 00:16:23.751

-Yeah.
-That's great, Iz.

239
00:16:29.256 --> 00:16:31.091
Yeah, you're gonna be
a natural.

240
00:16:31.124 --> 00:16:34.127
That trophy bat, that came alive

241
00:16:34.161 --> 00:16:35.362
Mm-hmm.

242
00:16:35.395 --> 00:16:39.166
I absolutely launched one
into the Bay.

243
00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:40.334
Pop!

244
00:16:40.367 --> 00:16:41.368
Splash.

245
00:16:41.401 --> 00:16:44.238
It was the ninth inning,
and I was at the plate,

246
00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:46.406
and I don't know what it was.

247
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.577
Just this sense of strength
came over me.

248
00:16:50.545 --> 00:16:52.079
I knew it.

249
00:16:52.112 --> 00:16:53.515
I knew it right then.

250
00:16:53.548 --> 00:16:54.716
My Izzy is...

251
00:16:56.116 --> 00:16:57.117
Dad? Oh, my gosh.

252
00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.252
What happened?

253
00:16:58.285 --> 00:16:59.453
-Ray?
-Are you okay?

254
00:16:59.486 --> 00:17:00.655
Ah, God,
I sliced it pretty good.

255
00:17:00.688 --> 00:17:02.590
What happened? Oh, that looks...

256
00:17:02.624 --> 00:17:03.725
Oh, God.

257
00:17:03.758 --> 00:17:05.392
Oh, my gosh.

258
00:17:05.425 --> 00:17:07.629
-Ew. What is that?
-Oh, God.

259
00:17:07.662 --> 00:17:09.429
Be careful.

260
00:17:10.565 --> 00:17:11.766
Is that supposed to happen?

261
00:17:11.799 --> 00:17:13.267
I don't think so.

262
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.802
<i>Is it safe?</i>

263
00:17:14.836 --> 00:17:16.671
No pool is absolutely safe.

264
00:17:16.704 --> 00:17:18.606
But you see that cap?

265
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.340
That's a wellhead.

266
00:17:20.374 --> 00:17:23.545
I-I've never seen an actual
spring-fed pool before

267
00:17:23.578 --> 00:17:26.681
in person, but you're tapped
into groundwater.

268
00:17:26.714 --> 00:17:28.315
I'm talking aquiclude.

269
00:17:28.348 --> 00:17:30.417
That's some sublevel
aquifer shit.

270
00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.319
-What does that mean?
-Yeah, what does that mean?

271
00:17:32.352 --> 00:17:33.721
I'm about to tell you
what that means.

272
00:17:33.755 --> 00:17:36.123
That means natural filtration,

273
00:17:36.156 --> 00:17:39.159
geothermal heating,
the whole shebang.

274
00:17:39.192 --> 00:17:42.129
Yeah, we'll give it a shock,
but these spring pools

275
00:17:42.162 --> 00:17:44.097
are supposed to work miracles
on your skin.

276
00:17:44.131 --> 00:17:46.568
This whole area
had natural pools all around.

277
00:17:46.601 --> 00:17:48.335
Wellness centers, health spas.

278
00:17:48.368 --> 00:17:50.270
-That's great. Lucky us, huh?
-Mm.

279
00:17:50.304 --> 00:17:51.271
Yeah.

280
00:17:51.305 --> 00:17:53.440
-It's funny, isn't it, though?
-Uh-huh.

281
00:17:53.473 --> 00:17:54.609
I mean...

282
00:17:54.642 --> 00:17:57.444
we evolved out of the water

283
00:17:57.477 --> 00:18:00.247
and some part of our
reptilian brain knows

284
00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.182
we're not supposed
to be there anymore,

285
00:18:02.215 --> 00:18:03.585
but----

286
00:18:03.618 --> 00:18:07.354
I guess that's why we try
to tame it so hard.

287
00:18:08.488 --> 00:18:11.593
It's like trying
to conquer death--

288
00:18:11.626 --> 00:18:12.827
-Oh!
-Jesus. Be Careful.

289
00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:13.861
Are you okay?

290
00:18:13.895 --> 00:18:15.128
God, sorry.

291
00:18:15.162 --> 00:18:16.296

292
00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:17.865

can be easily overwhelmed
by sensory stimulation,

and they may shut down
when emotionally dysregulated.

356
00:21:34.962 --> 00:21:37.064
Kids who are struggling
with anxiety

357
00:21:37.098 --> 00:21:39.100
and in-class performance...

358
00:21:39.133 --> 00:21:40.968
...they're inclined to...

359
00:22:03.991 --> 00:22:06.493
Hey, what's the matter?

360
00:22:07.995 --> 00:22:09.864
Huh?

361
00:22:09.897 --> 00:22:12.834
You don't want to swim?

362
00:22:12.867 --> 00:22:13.935
Hmm?

363
00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:18.039
Pussy.

364
00:22:57.945 --> 00:23:00.480
Ray, you scared me.

365
00:24:05.513 --> 00:24:07.548
His 27th home run this season,

366
00:24:07.581 --> 00:24:09.684
and the crowd is fully
back in the game.

367
00:24:09.717 --> 00:24:11.552
So many times,
we talk about how momentum

368
00:24:11.585 --> 00:24:13.521
can change
with one swing of the bat.

369
00:24:13.554 --> 00:24:15.723
One pitch, one play...

370
00:24:21.729 --> 00:24:23.064
You're all wet.

371
00:24:24.732 --> 00:24:27.467
Were you outside a minute ago?

372
00:24:28.102 --> 00:24:29.570
No.

373
00:24:29.603 --> 00:24:32.640
I think I just fell asleep.

374
00:24:34.942 --> 00:24:38.813
I think we should put in
a pool cover just to be safe.

375
00:24:39.814 --> 00:24:42.950
And we need to check out
the lights.

376
00:24:42.984 --> 00:24:44.719
Yeah, s... Yeah, for sure.

377
00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.121
Everything okay?

378
00:24:47.154 --> 00:24:48.556
Yeah.

379
00:24:48.589 --> 00:24:50.891
Yeah. Go back to sleep.

380
00:25:23.057 --> 00:25:24.759
Mom! Dad!

381
00:25:24.792 --> 00:25:26.660
Come look!

382
00:25:27.728 --> 00:25:29.997
He probably fell in
and got scared.

383
00:25:31.098 --> 00:25:34.602
Well, he, he'll come back
when he's hungry, huh?

384
00:25:34.635 --> 00:25:36.604
We have to find him.

385
00:25:36.637 --> 00:25:38.339
Yeah, that's...
We'll go look for him.

386
00:25:38.372 --> 00:25:40.307
We'll find him.

387
00:25:40.341 --> 00:25:41.942
It's okay, Ellie.
He'll come back.

388
00:25:41.976 --> 00:25:44.311
Pshh-pshh-pshh-pshh-
pshh-pshh-pshh!

389
00:25:44.345 --> 00:25:45.646
Cider.

390
00:25:45.679 --> 00:25:47.148
Come here, Cider.

391
00:25:47.181 --> 00:25:49.116
Come on, puss.

392
00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:51.052
Cider, where'd you go?

393
00:25:51.085 --> 00:25:53.120
Cider?

394
00:25:53.154 --> 00:25:55.322
Izzy,
did you look down there?

395
00:25:55.356 --> 00:25:57.358
No, I didn't check there.

396
00:25:57.391 --> 00:25:58.793
Here, puss.

397
00:25:58.826 --> 00:26:00.761
Maybe he's up in this tree?

398
00:26:01.695 --> 00:26:03.597
Come here, Cider.

399
00:26:03.631 --> 00:26:05.166
Cider.

400
00:26:05.199 --> 00:26:06.901
Cider!

401
00:26:07.835 --> 00:26:09.837
You guys look inside the house?

402
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:11.972
-Uh, yeah.
-Come here, buddy!

403
00:26:12.006 --> 00:26:14.041
Not upstairs, though.
Did you look upstairs?

404
00:26:14.075 --> 00:26:17.578
Again? I promise you,
I already checked upstairs.

405
00:26:20.714 --> 00:26:22.683
Cider!

406
00:26:23.717 --> 00:26:25.119
Here, Cider.

407
00:26:26.087 --> 00:26:27.888
Come on, Cider.

408
00:26:29.023 --> 00:26:30.891
Cider!

409
00:26:34.862 --> 00:26:36.730
Cider.

410
00:26:41.001 --> 00:26:42.670
Cider.

411
00:26:43.304 --> 00:26:45.139
Want some food?

412
00:26:48.742 --> 00:26:51.178
Come on, Cider.

413
00:26:56.217 --> 00:26:58.352
Come on, put your back
into it.

414
00:26:58.385 --> 00:26:59.954
We gotta roll it up,
make it tight,

415
00:26:59.987 --> 00:27:01.722
so when we roll it back out,
it's all clean and nice.

416
00:27:01.755 --> 00:27:03.257
Keep cranking.
One turn at a time.

417
00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:05.092
-I'm trying.
-Come on.

418
00:27:05.126 --> 00:27:06.694
Keep going. You strike out,
you keep going.

419
00:27:06.727 --> 00:27:07.895
Isn't that right?

420
00:27:07.928 --> 00:27:09.864
Yeah. Don't give up.
That's the key.

421
00:27:09.897 --> 00:27:12.399
That's the only thing that
matters. Let's go, come on.

422
00:27:12.433 --> 00:27:14.268
Good job. Little wins.

423
00:27:14.301 --> 00:27:15.769
Here we go. Come on.

424
00:27:15.803 --> 00:27:18.038
Be nice to your brother
right now.

425
00:27:19.006 --> 00:27:20.975
None of this has been
easy on him.

426
00:27:21.008 --> 00:27:24.278
Keep going, keep going.
Good job.

427
00:27:24.311 --> 00:27:25.980
There you go. See?

428
00:27:26.013 --> 00:27:28.916
I know it hasn't been easy
on you, either.

429
00:27:30.317 --> 00:27:31.886
Oh, no. Baby, I'm fine.

430
00:27:31.919 --> 00:27:34.655
I don't want you worrying
about me.

431
00:28:05.119 --> 00:28:06.854
What is that?

432
00:29:08.415 --> 00:29:09.850
Um, s...

433
00:29:09.883 --> 00:29:12.253
Uh, what-what is it?

434
00:29:15.856 --> 00:29:18.826
I've never seen such
a dramatic improvement

435
00:29:18.859 --> 00:29:21.161
in such a short time.

436
00:29:21.195 --> 00:29:24.198
We need to do more tests,
but...

437
00:29:24.231 --> 00:29:26.867
...it appears there are
no new lesions

438
00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:30.838
and the white tissue
is actually improving.

439
00:29:30.871 --> 00:29:34.041
We started the new diet
like you said,

440
00:29:34.074 --> 00:29:36.343
and the water therapy and...

441
00:29:36.377 --> 00:29:38.045
Twice a day.

442
00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.949
We have a pool.

443
00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.566
Hey, Mom, I finished
all my work in study hall.

444
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.000
Can I go swimming?

445
00:30:00.034 --> 00:30:01.435
Okay, but don't go alone.

446
00:30:01.468 --> 00:30:03.304
Ask your dad.

447
00:30:08.242 --> 00:30:10.545
A progress report.

448
00:30:10.578 --> 00:30:12.146
I, uh, you all know

449
00:30:12.179 --> 00:30:14.516
I was diagnosed with MS
not too long ago,

450
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:16.216
um, a little while back.

451
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:18.218
-Dad -I've been able
to work out in rehab

452
00:30:18.252 --> 00:30:21.322
and been getting back at it
for the last little while

453
00:30:21.355 --> 00:30:24.325
and I've made a lot of strides
that I'm proud of.

454
00:30:24.358 --> 00:30:26.193
I think that I can show you,

455
00:30:26.226 --> 00:30:29.263
demonstrate my ability
is still at a level that

456
00:30:29.296 --> 00:30:32.333
I'd be able to make an impact
on a team rather quickly.

457
00:30:32.366 --> 00:30:34.168
Hey, pal.

458
00:30:35.169 --> 00:30:37.237
Can you help me out
with something?

459
00:30:38.205 --> 00:30:39.440
Yeah.

460
00:30:39.473 --> 00:30:41.342
Can you throw on a 25?

461
00:30:50.652 --> 00:30:52.654
What are you doing
with the camera?

462
00:30:52.687 --> 00:30:55.255
Helps me with my training.

463
00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:12.139
Can you dive for coins with me?

464
00:31:12.172 --> 00:31:14.274
Mom says I can't swim alone.

465
00:31:18.713 --> 00:31:21.248
Yeah, um...

466
00:31:22.249 --> 00:31:24.118
Uh...

467
00:31:24.686 --> 00:31:26.019
Yeah.

468
00:31:26.053 --> 00:31:28.088
Hand me one of those coins.

469
00:31:31.291 --> 00:31:32.459
Here.

470
00:31:34.428 --> 00:31:36.296
You gotta promise me

471
00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:37.965
you're gonna stay
in the shallow end.

472
00:31:37.998 --> 00:31:39.166
-Okay?
-Okay.

473
00:31:39.199 --> 00:31:41.368
Throw this one in the pool
for me.

474
00:31:42.637 --> 00:31:45.372
And I'll come find it. Okay?

475
00:31:45.406 --> 00:31:47.374
All right.

476
00:32:31.285 --> 00:32:33.220
Hey, Dad.

477
00:33:30.645 --> 00:33:32.446
Hello?

478
00:33:42.089 --> 00:33:44.124
I got 'em all in one breath.

479
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.702
Izzy?

480
00:33:54.736 --> 00:33:56.370
It's not funny.

481
00:33:59.807 --> 00:34:01.576
Izzy?

482
00:34:04.546 --> 00:34:06.480
I know that's you.

483
00:34:09.584 --> 00:34:11.653
I'm keeping the money.

484
00:34:15.723 --> 00:34:18.425
Okay, I'm going under.

485
00:35:06.239 --> 00:35:08.375
Hello?

486
00:35:12.814 --> 00:35:15.215
Can you hear me?

487
00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.089
I need help.

488
00:35:25.392 --> 00:35:27.562
I'm looking for my mom.

489
00:35:28.763 --> 00:35:31.231
Who are you?

490
00:35:31.264 --> 00:35:33.735
My name is Rebecca Summers.

491
00:35:37.237 --> 00:35:39.507
I found your toy.

492
00:36:08.603 --> 00:36:10.605
Let go of me!

493
00:36:13.741 --> 00:36:16.376
Help!

494
00:36:24.719 --> 00:36:26.788
Mom.

495
00:36:27.822 --> 00:36:29.691
Is someone out here?

496
00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:37.297
Ellie, are you sure?

497
00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:38.966
Her name is Rebecca.

498
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.669
She said she was looking
for her mom.

499
00:37:07.327 --> 00:37:09.797
It was probably just a kid
who snuck over the gate.

500
00:37:09.831 --> 00:37:11.032
That's all.

501
00:37:11.065 --> 00:37:13.266
Anyway, we have a lock
on it now, so...

502
00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.368
I didn't see anyone out there.

503
00:37:16.003 --> 00:37:18.005
Maybe he's pretending.

504
00:37:18.039 --> 00:37:20.407
'Cause he doesn't have
any real friends yet.

505
00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.044
Remember he talked to that pet
gecko or lizard, or whatever?

506
00:37:23.077 --> 00:37:24.645
He was five.

507
00:37:24.679 --> 00:37:26.647
Yeah, but he talked to him
for months after he died.

508
00:37:26.681 --> 00:37:28.950
He's gonna make friends.
He just...

509
00:37:28.983 --> 00:37:31.485
It just takes him time.

510
00:37:31.519 --> 00:37:32.352
Yeah.

511
00:37:32.385 --> 00:37:35.022
I'm going to his practice
later today.

512
00:37:35.056 --> 00:37:38.793
So, maybe that'll help, like,
break the ice with the kids.

513
00:37:38.826 --> 00:37:40.728
Yeah.

514
00:37:40.762 --> 00:37:42.897
You should come,
'cause he always plays better

515
00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:45.265
when you're there.
He's more himself.

516
00:37:46.634 --> 00:37:48.401
Hmm.

517
00:37:49.436 --> 00:37:51.539
Maybe we should have
the team over.

518
00:37:51.572 --> 00:37:54.075
-You know, for a cookout
or something? -Yes.

519
00:37:54.108 --> 00:37:55.408
That's a great idea.

520
00:37:55.442 --> 00:37:57.410
-Yeah?
-Yeah, like a pool party.

521
00:37:57.444 --> 00:37:59.446
That's why I married you,
because you're a genius.

522
00:37:59.479 --> 00:38:01.048
Invite your coworkers,
friends, whoever.

523
00:38:01.082 --> 00:38:02.683
-Just "Meet the Wallers," right?
-Mm-hmm.

524
00:38:02.717 --> 00:38:04.652
-Sounds great.
-Can I invite some friends?

525
00:38:04.685 --> 00:38:06.521
Yes, invite whoever you want.
It's a great idea.

526
00:38:06.554 --> 00:38:07.922
We should invite
everybody you know.

527
00:38:07.955 --> 00:38:09.791
-We're a welcoming family.
-Stop.

528
00:38:09.824 --> 00:38:11.324
How many people you think
we can fit in the pool?

529
00:38:11.358 --> 00:38:12.392
We're the pool family now.

530
00:38:13.561 --> 00:38:14.929
All right. Get in front of it.

531
00:38:14.962 --> 00:38:17.064
Good. Move it around.

532
00:38:17.098 --> 00:38:18.833
There you go, in front of it,
in front of it.

533
00:38:19.867 --> 00:38:21.102
It's all right. It's all right.

534
00:38:21.135 --> 00:38:22.804
Get in front of it.
In front of it.

535
00:38:24.071 --> 00:38:26.040
Come on, wake up, man.

536
00:38:26.073 --> 00:38:27.542
Let's hustle.
Let's hustle, boys.

537
00:38:27.575 --> 00:38:29.710
You know what baseball is,
right?

538
00:38:30.978 --> 00:38:33.581
It's a stick and a ball

539
00:38:33.614 --> 00:38:36.517
and a bunch of guys
wearing long socks.

540
00:38:38.052 --> 00:38:40.387
It's play.

541
00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.558
How come it's so easy
for Dad and Izzy?

542
00:38:43.591 --> 00:38:45.693
It's not.

543
00:38:45.726 --> 00:38:48.095
Everyone's scared of something.

544
00:38:48.129 --> 00:38:51.732
Izzy used to hate
drop-off in kindergarten.

545
00:38:51.766 --> 00:38:53.968
Every day, I'd wait outside
until I saw her

546
00:38:54.001 --> 00:38:57.370
in the classroom window,
and she'd give me the signal.

547
00:38:57.404 --> 00:38:58.706
Show him, Iz.

548
00:38:58.739 --> 00:39:01.843
There we go!
Good job, good job.

549
00:39:01.876 --> 00:39:03.611
Green light to swing.

550
00:39:03.644 --> 00:39:04.979
Wait for the ball, boys!

551
00:39:05.012 --> 00:39:06.147
Come on, come on!

552
00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.782
-Hey, there he is.
-Hey, Coach.

553
00:39:07.815 --> 00:39:08.983
Sorry I'm late.

554
00:39:09.016 --> 00:39:10.718
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

555
00:39:10.751 --> 00:39:11.719
All right.

556
00:39:11.752 --> 00:39:13.988
You got this.

557
00:39:14.021 --> 00:39:16.123
Hey, boys, this is Elliot's dad.

558
00:39:16.157 --> 00:39:18.159
He's a former Brewers
third baseman,

559
00:39:18.192 --> 00:39:20.928
and he's here to turn you
into all-star hitters.

560
00:39:20.962 --> 00:39:22.462
Uh, you got this.

561
00:39:22.495 --> 00:39:24.431
You got this. Nice and easy.

562
00:39:26.167 --> 00:39:28.002
You gotta follow through
the ball.

563
00:39:28.035 --> 00:39:29.604
Don't just, like, check swing.

564
00:39:29.637 --> 00:39:31.471
-There you go.
-Yes! Nice!

565
00:39:31.505 --> 00:39:33.140
All right. Line drive
up the middle. There you go.

566
00:39:33.174 --> 00:39:34.675
All right, move it around,
move it around.

567
00:39:34.709 --> 00:39:36.443
You're bent way over
at the waist, right?

568
00:39:36.476 --> 00:39:37.979
And you turn out with your body.

569
00:39:38.012 --> 00:39:39.881
Don't hit it with your hands.
You turn out with your body.

570
00:39:39.914 --> 00:39:41.481
-All right. Good job.
-There you go!

571
00:39:41.515 --> 00:39:42.884
Way to get on top of it.
Good job.

572
00:39:42.917 --> 00:39:44.652
Oh, hey, Ray, that's my son, Ty.

573
00:39:44.685 --> 00:39:46.721
Yeah, keep an eye.
He's got good mechanics.

574
00:39:46.754 --> 00:39:48.723
All right, Ty.
Let's see what you got.

575
00:39:50.057 --> 00:39:51.491
There you go.

576
00:39:51.525 --> 00:39:53.027
Yes, Ty. Yes.

577
00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:54.795
-Good swing. Good hit.
-Yeah, I got you, Dad.

578
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:56.463
-Good job.
-Thanks, Mr. Waller.

579
00:39:56.496 --> 00:39:58.666
All right, El, you ready?

580
00:39:58.699 --> 00:40:00.034
Go, Ellie!

581
00:40:00.067 --> 00:40:01.501
-All right, let's go.
-Hey.

582
00:40:01.535 --> 00:40:03.436
Good luck out there, man.
You got this.

583
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:05.438
Way to go. Whoo. Good job, Ty.

584
00:40:05.472 --> 00:40:06.908
Hey, Ellie.

585
00:40:12.813 --> 00:40:14.715
All right, Elliot.

586
00:40:14.749 --> 00:40:17.051
All right, come on.
You got this.

587
00:40:17.084 --> 00:40:18.653
You got it, Elliot.

588
00:40:19.186 --> 00:40:20.655
-There you go. Nice!
-Nice going.

589
00:40:20.688 --> 00:40:23.057
There you go. All right.
Good job.

590
00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:24.525
-Yes, Elliot.
-All right.

591
00:40:24.558 --> 00:40:25.793
That's what stepping
into the ball does.

592
00:40:25.826 --> 00:40:27.194
You go after it and you get it.

593
00:40:27.228 --> 00:40:28.696
Good job. Way to go.

594
00:40:28.729 --> 00:40:30.097
Try for the other side
of the field. Way to go.

595
00:40:30.131 --> 00:40:31.532
We'll work on it.
Don't worry about it.

596
00:40:31.565 --> 00:40:32.833
Hey, Ray,
you want to take some?

597
00:40:32.867 --> 00:40:33.500
Um...

598
00:40:33.534 --> 00:40:36.103
I mean, if you're up for it.

599
00:40:36.137 --> 00:40:38.039
Um...

600
00:40:38.072 --> 00:40:39.941
-Yeah?
-Sure, right?

601
00:40:39.974 --> 00:40:41.642
Take a couple. I'll be fine.

602
00:40:41.676 --> 00:40:44.011
All right. All right,
get ready, boys! Get ready!

603
00:40:44.045 --> 00:40:45.478
All right.

604
00:40:45.513 --> 00:40:46.881
Okay, you ready?

605
00:40:46.914 --> 00:40:48.215
You guys ready out there?

606
00:40:48.249 --> 00:40:49.684
Bend your knees.
Bend your knees.

607
00:40:49.717 --> 00:40:51.686
Take it easy on me.

608
00:40:51.719 --> 00:40:54.454
I haven't swung in a while.

609
00:40:57.158 --> 00:41:00.528
All right, hold on.
Let me loosen up real quick.

610
00:41:00.561 --> 00:41:03.731
-Okay, okay. Next one.
-Just let me... Yeah.

611
00:41:12.173 --> 00:41:13.841
Dad?

612
00:41:13.874 --> 00:41:15.910
Ooh. You okay, boss?

613
00:41:15.943 --> 00:41:17.712
Ooh.

614
00:41:17.745 --> 00:41:18.879
Ray?

615
00:41:18.913 --> 00:41:20.047
You okay?

616
00:41:20.081 --> 00:41:22.717
Uh, I'm okay.

617
00:41:24.752 --> 00:41:26.020
I'm good. Let's keep going.

618
00:41:26.053 --> 00:41:27.855
-Okay.
-I'm good. I'm good.

619
00:41:27.888 --> 00:41:29.256
Shit.

620
00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:30.925
Why don't you throw that again?

621
00:41:30.958 --> 00:41:32.059
All right.

622
00:42:13.934 --> 00:42:17.104
Oh! Oh, my God!

623
00:42:17.138 --> 00:42:18.305
Oh, my God!

624
00:42:21.108 --> 00:42:22.777
Whoo!

625
00:42:30.084 --> 00:42:32.353
See, boys,
that's how you hit a ball.

626
00:42:32.386 --> 00:42:34.588
That's how you hit it, man.

627
00:42:49.336 --> 00:42:50.604
You know the deal.

628
00:42:50.638 --> 00:42:51.972
Stay in the house, bed by 10:00.

629
00:42:52.006 --> 00:42:53.707
-We'll be back after dinner.
-Mm-hmm.

630
00:42:53.741 --> 00:42:55.743
Don't make me regret
not getting a sitter.

631
00:42:55.776 --> 00:42:57.812
-Yeah, okay, I know.
-Yeah?

632
00:42:57.845 --> 00:42:59.947
Ray, you ready?

633
00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:01.682
We gotta go.

634
00:43:10.124 --> 00:43:12.093
Hey, someone's coming over
in a minute.

635
00:43:12.126 --> 00:43:13.894
It's not a big deal.

636
00:43:13.928 --> 00:43:15.596
Okay.

637
00:43:16.864 --> 00:43:19.600
It's for the swim team.

638
00:43:20.201 --> 00:43:22.703
Okay.

639
00:43:32.279 --> 00:43:33.781
If you tell Mom,

640
00:43:33.814 --> 00:43:37.017
I'm gonna put a Tide POD
in your fish tank.

"fish out of water"?

I didn't see anything.

688
00:47:21.241 --> 00:47:23.143
You were only down there
for a couple seconds.

689
00:47:23.177 --> 00:47:25.312
Maybe your foot got stuck
in the pool cleaner.

690

-I-I...

-Shh, shh, shh.

716
00:48:49.396 --> 00:48:51.198
Shh, shh. Stop.

717
00:48:55.102 --> 00:48:58.005
Things have been better
since we moved here.

718
00:48:59.072 --> 00:49:01.743
I mean, Dad's healthier.

719
00:49:01.776 --> 00:49:03.611
Mom's happy.

720
00:49:03.645 --> 00:49:06.714
Do you want to freak them out
just so we have to move again?

721
00:49:06.748 --> 00:49:08.415
What makes more sense,

722
00:49:08.449 --> 00:49:11.485
that the pool's helping us
or that it's haunted?

723
00:49:12.453 --> 00:49:14.321
What if it's both?

724
00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:16.524
Hey, I'm back!

725
00:49:19.794 --> 00:49:21.328
Keep your mouth shut.

726
00:49:21.361 --> 00:49:23.263
Hey. Where are you two?

727
00:49:23.297 --> 00:49:25.567
No one's gonna believe us
anyway.

728
00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.334
Coming, Mom.

729
00:49:27.367 --> 00:49:29.002
I can help.

730
00:49:29.637 --> 00:49:32.039
Everything okay?

731
00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:36.076
Yeah, Mom. Everything's fine.

732
00:49:38.412 --> 00:49:39.781

00:50:01.101 --> 00:50:02.570
You're hosting

-Of course.

Hey.

746
00:50:11.378 --> 00:50:13.247
Oh, my God,
the house looks great.

747
00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:13.948
Oh, wow.

748
00:50:13.982 --> 00:50:16.551
Oh, I made my jiggly rum cake.

749
00:50:16.584 --> 00:50:17.785
Wow.

750
00:50:17.819 --> 00:50:19.453
But this is not
for the kids. Okay?

751
00:50:19.486 --> 00:50:21.121
There's enough Captain Morgan
in here

752
00:50:21.154 --> 00:50:23.558
to get Phil into his famous
Bermuda G-string.

753
00:50:33.701 --> 00:50:35.570
-You seem to be doing
a lot better, man. -Thank you.

754
00:50:35.603 --> 00:50:37.539
I don't think I've ever seen
anybody hit a ball that hard.

755
00:50:37.572 --> 00:50:40.207
Tell my agent
that when you see him.

756
00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:43.143
Yeah, he used to rep, uh,
Evan Longoria, Mark Teixeira.

757
00:50:43.176 --> 00:50:44.478
-He repped a lot
of good people. -No shit.

758
00:50:44.512 --> 00:50:46.413
-Yeah. -You know, I'd love
for Ty to meet him.

759
00:50:46.446 --> 00:50:48.115
Yeah, sure. Maybe I can
get him to come to practice.

760
00:50:48.148 --> 00:50:49.551
Sun's out, guns out.

761
00:50:49.584 --> 00:50:51.351
You ready? Let's go.

762
00:50:51.385 --> 00:50:53.287
Coming in.

763
00:51:01.295 --> 00:51:03.698
Yeah, so he, he came over
for a swim last night.

764
00:51:03.731 --> 00:51:06.199
Um, it was cool.

765
00:51:07.334 --> 00:51:10.838
But, uh, he... he kissed me.

766
00:51:10.872 --> 00:51:13.173
Shut up. No, he didn't.

767
00:51:13.206 --> 00:51:15.577
But I, I actually think it's
hotter that he's Christian.

768
00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:16.878
-Really?
-Really?

769
00:51:16.911 --> 00:51:18.345
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
It's, like, forbidden.

770
00:51:18.378 --> 00:51:20.380
Hey, Izzy, I got this for you.

What?

773
00:51:24.686 --> 00:51:26.453
Nothing. We were just... We're
saying we should go for a swim.

774
00:51:26.486 --> 00:51:27.755
-We're gonna go for a swim.
-Yeah.

775
00:51:27.789 --> 00:51:29.524
We're gonna head
out to the water.

776
00:51:29.557 --> 00:51:30.692
Come on. Come on.

777
00:51:30.725 --> 00:51:31.893
I'm good, thanks.

-Do you swim?

784
00:51:51.846 --> 00:51:53.347
Oh, my dad was Navy.

785
00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:56.249
I was doing dive drills
before I could walk.

786
00:51:56.283 --> 00:51:58.620
Oh, you should have
seen her eyes light up

787
00:51:58.653 --> 00:52:00.253
when she saw this place.

788
00:52:01.221 --> 00:52:03.357

you're used to hosting.

It's just nice to meet people

792
00:52:08.963 --> 00:52:10.898
you might actually know
next year.

00:52:24.411 --> 00:52:25.647
Oh, I did.
I'm wearing it already.

797
00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:26.814
Okay, good.

798
00:52:26.848 --> 00:52:29.550

Where are you?
Let's get in the pool.

804
00:52:48.970 --> 00:52:50.672
-Mr. Waller?
-Hey.

805
00:52:50.705 --> 00:52:51.773
Hey, El!

806
00:52:51.806 --> 00:52:54.274
Will you sign this for me?

807
00:52:54.307 --> 00:52:57.277
It took me like an hour
to find it last night.

808
00:53:06.954 --> 00:53:08.656
Yeah, of course.

809
00:53:10.323 --> 00:53:11.759
Thank you so much.

810
00:53:11.793 --> 00:53:13.193
Yeah.

811
00:53:14.996 --> 00:53:16.363
There you go.

812
00:53:16.396 --> 00:53:18.265
-Now hold on to that.
-Oh, I will.

813
00:53:18.298 --> 00:53:19.767
It's gonna be worth something
someday.

814
00:53:19.801 --> 00:53:21.803
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

815
00:53:21.836 --> 00:53:22.837
Hey.

816
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:23.905
Yeah?

817
00:53:25.139 --> 00:53:28.341
Steroid Shrek over here
thinks he owns the damn pool.

818
00:53:28.375 --> 00:53:30.410
Think we can take him?

819
00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:35.783
Yeah, I got you, man!

820
00:53:37.752 --> 00:53:39.721
-All right, we got this, okay?
-Yeah. All right.

821
00:53:39.754 --> 00:53:41.455
-Let's go. Come on.
-Okay.

822
00:53:48.295 --> 00:53:50.464
You ready, Big League?

823
00:53:54.902 --> 00:53:56.604
Nice, buddy.

824
00:53:56.637 --> 00:53:57.572
Get 'em, Mikey!

825
00:53:57.605 --> 00:53:59.607
You know, when we were
fixing up the pool,

826
00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:02.977
they said it hadn't been used
in probably 15 years.

827
00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:04.344
Maybe longer.

828
00:54:04.377 --> 00:54:06.446
It's weird, right?

829
00:54:07.347 --> 00:54:08.616
No. No, I don't know.

830
00:54:08.649 --> 00:54:11.251
Maybe they weren't pool people.

831
00:54:13.988 --> 00:54:14.956
Kay?

832
00:54:14.989 --> 00:54:16.657
Hmm?

833
00:54:18.391 --> 00:54:19.794
Okay, you know what?

834
00:54:23.064 --> 00:54:24.632
You know, this is your new home,

835
00:54:24.665 --> 00:54:26.466
and I-I didn't want to
say anything

836
00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:29.737
that would taint your...
your feelings about this house.

837
00:54:29.771 --> 00:54:32.507
Come on, we closed months ago.
What is it?

838
00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:33.941
-Get it, buddy. Yeah.
-Ty, use your core.

839
00:54:33.975 --> 00:54:35.475
-Let's go!
-Use your core, Ty.

840
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:36.644
-There you go.
-Lean forward a little bit.

841
00:54:36.677 --> 00:54:38.378
-Yeah. That's it.
-Lean forward.

842
00:54:38.411 --> 00:54:39.914
-Use your arms. Your arms.
-Going down, Mikey.

843
00:54:39.947 --> 00:54:43.785
I swear, I had no idea
that this was the same house

844
00:54:43.818 --> 00:54:45.920
until my friend told me
after you'd already moved in.

845
00:54:45.953 --> 00:54:49.524
And I was gonna tell you,
but you seemed so happy here.

846
00:54:49.557 --> 00:54:53.326
And I... I didn't want to put
any poo in the pudding.

847
00:54:56.564 --> 00:54:58.431
Um...

848
00:54:58.465 --> 00:54:59.834
it-it's very possible

849
00:54:59.867 --> 00:55:02.603
that the people who lived here
before, that they...

850
00:55:02.637 --> 00:55:04.371
You know,
they liked the neighborhood,

851
00:55:04.404 --> 00:55:05.706
and they wanted
the good school district,

852
00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:09.010
but they didn't feel comfortable
using the pool

853
00:55:09.043 --> 00:55:11.411
because of certain
alleged events.

854
00:55:11.444 --> 00:55:13.080
Alleged events?

855
00:55:14.949 --> 00:55:16.416
Yeah, I...

856
00:55:16.449 --> 00:55:17.819
You know, I don't remember
much about it.

857
00:55:17.852 --> 00:55:19.452
Just, there were these stories

858
00:55:19.486 --> 00:55:23.057
about this little girl who--
uh, from Harold Holt--

859
00:55:23.090 --> 00:55:26.426
and she drowned here.

860
00:55:27.427 --> 00:55:31.431
I know, it's just...
Oh, it is a tragedy.

861
00:55:31.464 --> 00:55:32.934
You know, I-I mean, I don't
know why that would make

862
00:55:32.967 --> 00:55:35.002
someone not want to use
a perfectly good swimming pool,

863
00:55:35.036 --> 00:55:36.436
but you know what?

864
00:55:36.469 --> 00:55:38.438
People are...
They're superstitious.

865
00:55:38.471 --> 00:55:39.874
Aren't they, really?

866
00:55:41.142 --> 00:55:43.611
Was the little girl's name
Rebecca?

867
00:55:45.146 --> 00:55:47.014
Wait. How did you know that?

868
00:55:47.048 --> 00:55:49.083
Okay, keep pushing.

869
00:55:49.116 --> 00:55:50.952
Let's go. Let's take 'em down.

870
00:55:50.985 --> 00:55:52.485
Come on, Ty.

871
00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:54.555
-Don't give up. Use your legs.
-Let's go.

872
00:55:54.589 --> 00:55:55.990
-Come on, Ty.
-Keep going.

873
00:55:56.023 --> 00:55:57.124
-Use your legs, Ty.
-You got him. Keep pushing.

874
00:55:58.693 --> 00:56:00.528
-Don't give up.
-Get him, Mikey.

875
00:56:00.561 --> 00:56:02.864
-That's it, buddy.
-You're going down!

876
00:56:09.904 --> 00:56:11.105
Let's go! We won!

877
00:56:11.138 --> 00:56:12.740
Whoo!

878
00:56:12.773 --> 00:56:14.008
Let's go!

879
00:56:14.041 --> 00:56:16.878
We did it, Mr. Waller! Whoo!

880
00:56:16.911 --> 00:56:19.146
All right, you can let go now.

881
00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:21.649
Mr. Waller. Mr. Waller.

882
00:56:22.516 --> 00:56:24.585
Hey, let go. Hey!

883
00:56:24.619 --> 00:56:27.154
Mr. Waller, please let go.

884
00:56:27.188 --> 00:56:29.924
You've got my legs, Mr. Waller.

885
00:56:29.957 --> 00:56:32.894
Let go! Let go!

886
00:56:40.668 --> 00:56:42.069
Mr. Waller.

887
00:56:42.103 --> 00:56:44.038
You're grabbing on my legs.
Stop.

888
00:56:44.071 --> 00:56:46.040
Let go. Mr. Waller!

889
00:56:52.113 --> 00:56:53.514
Mr. Waller...

890
00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:57.184
Let go!

891
00:57:12.066 --> 00:57:13.668
Mom!

892
00:57:14.669 --> 00:57:16.570
Hey, Ty.

893
00:57:17.171 --> 00:57:19.507
Ty.

894
00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:20.942
Baby, you seen Ty?

895
00:57:20.975 --> 00:57:22.810
Mom! Mom!

896
00:57:23.644 --> 00:57:25.780
Mom. Outside in the pool.

897
00:57:29.183 --> 00:57:30.785
Oh, my God. Ty!

898
00:57:30.818 --> 00:57:31.953
Oh, my...

899
00:57:31.986 --> 00:57:35.690
-Ty? -Out of the way!
Out of the way! Out of the way!

900
00:57:38.025 --> 00:57:39.727
Ty! What happened?

901
00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:41.095
Help me! Someone help!

902
00:57:41.128 --> 00:57:42.163
-Give him to me.
-Get him out.

903
00:57:42.196 --> 00:57:43.965
Pull him over the edge.

904
00:57:43.998 --> 00:57:45.533
Someone call for help!

905
00:57:45.566 --> 00:57:46.968
-Mom, look! It's Dad!
-Move!

906
00:57:47.001 --> 00:57:48.836
-Ty, breathe. Breathe.
-It's okay. It's okay.

907
00:57:48.869 --> 00:57:50.504
-I got him. -Come on, breathe,
breathe. Wh-What happened?

908
00:57:50.538 --> 00:57:52.273
What happened?

909
00:57:52.306 --> 00:57:53.641
What the hell happened?

910
00:57:53.674 --> 00:57:55.209
Someone call for help.

911
00:57:55.242 --> 00:57:56.844
Call 911! Someone call for help.

912
00:57:56.877 --> 00:57:58.646
Ray. Ray.

913
00:57:58.679 --> 00:58:00.648
What happened, Ty?

914
00:58:09.023 --> 00:58:12.126
Dad? Dad?

915
00:58:12.159 --> 00:58:13.761
-You're okay.
-Okay.

916
00:58:13.794 --> 00:58:15.930
-Yeah, just hold on to my arm.
-It's okay. It's okay.

917
00:58:15.963 --> 00:58:17.732
-Okay.
-Let's get him inside.

918
00:58:17.765 --> 00:58:20.001
-Okay, one, two...
-It's okay. You're okay.

919
00:58:30.144 --> 00:58:31.846
Ty said he wouldn't let go.

920
00:58:31.879 --> 00:58:34.281
No, Coach, you know the disease
attacks his nervous system.

921
00:58:34.315 --> 00:58:36.684
I mean...
No. He nearly drowned, too.

922
00:58:36.717 --> 00:58:39.086
We're not gonna press charges,
Officer.

923
00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:40.321
We're fine.

924
00:58:40.354 --> 00:58:42.156
Uh, hey, Eve, I just...

925
00:58:42.189 --> 00:58:45.893
I don't think Ray should come
to practice anymore.

926
00:58:47.695 --> 00:58:49.196
Look, I'm so sorry.

927
00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:51.265
Do you hear what he's saying?

928
00:58:51.298 --> 00:58:54.668
Don't come near
our family again.

929
00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:14.922
-Come on, let's go.
Let's go. -Wait. Wait.

930
00:59:14.955 --> 00:59:16.323
-Stop, stop. Stop.
-Here, just put the...

931
00:59:16.357 --> 00:59:17.658
-Stop. God, wait.
-Get in the car.

932
00:59:17.691 --> 00:59:19.660
Wait. Where are we going?

933
00:59:19.693 --> 00:59:21.829
I don't know. Just not here.

934
00:59:21.862 --> 00:59:24.065
There's something wrong
with that pool.

935
00:59:24.098 --> 00:59:26.100
Eve, there's nothing wrong
with the pool.

936
00:59:26.133 --> 00:59:27.868
The pool's fine.

937
00:59:27.902 --> 00:59:30.204
The pool's the greatest thing
to ever happen to me.

938
00:59:30.237 --> 00:59:31.806
Look.

939
00:59:31.839 --> 00:59:33.307
Listen. I mean, honey,
it would be different this time.

940
00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:34.675
It would be so different.

941
00:59:34.708 --> 00:59:35.876
We wouldn't have to make
the same sacri...

942
00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:38.012
What are you talking about?

943
00:59:38.045 --> 00:59:40.581
You almost drowned today.

944
00:59:43.350 --> 00:59:45.352
That little boy almost drowned.

945
01:00:00.367 --> 01:00:02.837
Dad?

946
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:05.239
-Dad, stop.
-Mom, what's going on?

947
01:00:05.272 --> 01:00:07.708
Stop the car.

948
01:00:07.741 --> 01:00:09.844
-Mom, do something.
-I don't know what to do.

949
01:00:09.877 --> 01:00:11.712
Is he breathing?

950
01:00:11.745 --> 01:00:12.913
What is happening?

951
01:00:12.947 --> 01:00:14.648
Please! He can't breathe!

952
01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:17.384
-Cough it out.
-Oh, my God.

953
01:00:17.418 --> 01:00:19.653
-Dad.
-Get him out of the car!

954
01:00:19.687 --> 01:00:21.255
<i>No, no, no, he's stable now,</i>

955
01:00:21.288 --> 01:00:25.092
<i>but I... I've never seen him</i>
<i>like this before.</i>

956
01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.863
It was like something was
attacking him from the inside.

957
01:00:28.896 --> 01:00:30.397
Look, I know these episodes

958
01:00:30.431 --> 01:00:31.899
<i>are frightening.</i>

959
01:00:31.932 --> 01:00:33.801
<i>I can have him come in</i>
<i>on Tuesday</i>

960
01:00:33.834 --> 01:00:35.936
<i>for another round of tests,</i>
<i>but in the meantime,</i>

961
01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:39.173
<i>just let him rest and recover.</i>

962
01:00:44.011 --> 01:00:45.146
Eve.

963
01:00:45.179 --> 01:00:46.881
I'm sorry.
I don't know what's happening.

964
01:00:46.914 --> 01:00:47.616
It's okay.

965
01:00:47.648 --> 01:00:49.183
I didn't mean to hurt that boy.

966
01:00:49.216 --> 01:00:50.951
You don't have to talk.

967
01:00:54.755 --> 01:00:56.357
We'll just get you stable
and just...

968
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:58.726
We'll figure out what to do.

969
01:01:01.462 --> 01:01:03.764
It's just one more time.
It's just one more.

970
01:01:03.797 --> 01:01:05.332
I just need one more time.

971
01:01:05.366 --> 01:01:06.901
You can carry me into the pool.

972
01:01:06.934 --> 01:01:09.103
I just need to get in
one more time.

973
01:01:19.079 --> 01:01:21.749
It's so cool in the deep water.

974
01:01:24.785 --> 01:01:27.821
It's so cool in the deep.

975
01:02:00.254 --> 01:02:02.823
I told him he could
sleep here tonight.

976
01:02:20.007 --> 01:02:23.944
You know your dad talks about
being at bat and...

977
01:02:23.978 --> 01:02:28.749
feeling this rush of strength
when you were born?

978
01:02:30.017 --> 01:02:36.524
I was 22 in a hospital
surrounded by strangers, and...

979
01:02:36.558 --> 01:02:39.927
and I felt totally alone.

980
01:02:42.363 --> 01:02:43.864
And I didn't...

981
01:02:43.897 --> 01:02:45.199
And I didn't think
I could keep pushing.

982
01:02:45.232 --> 01:02:48.836
I didn't think I would...
I didn't...

983
01:02:48.869 --> 01:02:51.905
I didn't think I would be
a good mom.

984
01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:55.876
And I just wanted to give up.

985
01:02:57.244 --> 01:03:01.915
And you must have felt
how scared I was.

986
01:03:01.949 --> 01:03:07.855
Because suddenly,
there you were.

987
01:03:09.056 --> 01:03:12.059
And I wasn't alone anymore.

988
01:03:19.534 --> 01:03:22.903
We're never alone
if we have each other.

989
01:03:24.471 --> 01:03:28.142
I'm not gonna let anything
bad happen to us, okay?

990
01:03:29.076 --> 01:03:31.345
Okay.

991
01:03:37.084 --> 01:03:38.986
<i>Hi, Eve.</i>
<i>I'm sorry your party ended</i>

992
01:03:39.019 --> 01:03:40.888
<i>on a sour note,</i>
<i>but you give people time</i>

993
01:03:40.921 --> 01:03:42.923
<i>and they're gonna</i>
<i>forget all about it.</i>

994
01:03:42.956 --> 01:03:45.259
<i>Kay, it's not that. It's...</i>

995
01:03:45.292 --> 01:03:48.596
<i>Would you consider yourself</i>
<i>an open-minded person?</i>

996
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:50.364
<i>Yeah, I like to think so.</i>

997
01:03:50.397 --> 01:03:51.599
<i>Why are you asking?</i>

998
01:03:51.633 --> 01:03:53.133
It wasn't just Rebecca.

999
01:03:53.167 --> 01:03:55.035
If you go back,
there's more people

1000
01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:57.071
<i>who lived at the house</i>
<i>who just went missing.</i>

1001
01:03:57.104 --> 01:03:58.906
<i>I need to know what's going on.</i>

1002
01:03:58.939 --> 01:04:00.575
<i>Eve, I swear I told you</i>

1003
01:04:00.608 --> 01:04:02.042
<i>everything I knew at the house.</i>

1004
01:04:02.076 --> 01:04:04.478
<i>I don't know anything</i>
<i>about this.</i>

1005
01:04:04.512 --> 01:04:06.180
<i>Just tell me what I can do</i>
<i>to help.</i>

1006
01:04:06.213 --> 01:04:08.082
<i>Does the Summers family</i>
<i>live nearby?</i>

1007
01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.662
Hi.

1008
01:04:54.696 --> 01:04:57.632
My name is Eve Waller.

1009
01:04:57.665 --> 01:04:59.400
I tried to call you yesterday.

1010
01:04:59.433 --> 01:05:02.469
I think my family lives
in your old house.

1011
01:05:02.503 --> 01:05:04.539
With the pool?

1012
01:05:04.572 --> 01:05:06.407
Oh.

1013
01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.675
Yes.

1014
01:05:07.709 --> 01:05:09.243
Come in.

1015
01:05:10.244 --> 01:05:12.446
That's Thomas.

1016
01:05:12.479 --> 01:05:16.083
USAID ambassador in Washington.

1017
01:05:16.116 --> 01:05:19.386
His work in Sudan
saved thousands

1018
01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:22.256
during the refugee crisis.

1019
01:05:22.289 --> 01:05:23.157
Your son?

1020
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:25.527
Yeah. My pride and joy.

1021
01:05:27.027 --> 01:05:30.297
He's responsible
for this beautiful home.

1022
01:05:30.330 --> 01:05:32.634
Though he doesn't visit
as much as I'd like.

1023
01:05:32.667 --> 01:05:34.636
This is about as far

1024
01:05:34.669 --> 01:05:37.404
as I can make it,
if you don't mind.

1025
01:05:37.438 --> 01:05:39.106
Please.

1026
01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:46.180
I know this is strange,
but I wanted to ask you about

1027
01:05:46.213 --> 01:05:47.981
when you lived at the house.

1028
01:05:48.015 --> 01:05:49.983
Oh.

1029
01:05:50.017 --> 01:05:53.187
What a special place.

1030
01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:54.455
Tommy loved that pool.

1031
01:05:54.488 --> 01:05:57.926
I could hardly
get him out of the water.

1032
01:05:59.561 --> 01:06:02.362
Did you have a daughter, too?

1033
01:06:05.199 --> 01:06:08.035
No, it's-it's just Thomas and I.

1034
01:06:08.068 --> 01:06:11.739
Oh, he writes
the most wonderful letters.

1035
01:06:11.773 --> 01:06:14.074
He's in Washington,

1036
01:06:14.107 --> 01:06:16.276
doing so much good.

1037
01:06:19.781 --> 01:06:22.650
Mrs. Summers,
I'm not here to upset you.

1038
01:06:22.684 --> 01:06:26.153
But I don't know
who else to talk to.

1039
01:06:27.522 --> 01:06:29.624
My husband was sick,

1040
01:06:29.657 --> 01:06:33.494
and we moved into the house,

1041
01:06:33.528 --> 01:06:35.597
and he started getting better.

1042
01:06:37.331 --> 01:06:39.767
And I think...

1043
01:06:39.801 --> 01:06:42.469
the pool made him better.

1044
01:06:44.672 --> 01:06:48.408
But my kids have seen things.

1045
01:06:49.744 --> 01:06:52.145
And so have I.

1046
01:06:55.550 --> 01:07:00.220
There's something bad
in the water, isn't there?

1047
01:07:09.697 --> 01:07:12.132
What happened to your daughter?

1048
01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:14.434
To Rebecca?

1049
01:07:18.238 --> 01:07:20.307
Please. I'm worried
that the same thing

1050
01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:21.843
is going to happen
to my husband.

1051
01:07:43.363 --> 01:07:47.134
Did you ever use
a wishing well as a child?

1052
01:07:48.736 --> 01:07:50.838
Throw a coin in the water

1053
01:07:50.872 --> 01:07:55.342
and pray with all your heart.

1054
01:07:58.178 --> 01:08:01.348
Some water is magic.

1055
01:08:11.759 --> 01:08:15.563
Before there was a house

1056
01:08:15.597 --> 01:08:18.165
or a pool...

1057
01:08:18.198 --> 01:08:21.335
<i>there was a spring</i>
<i>in the ground.</i>

1058
01:08:22.369 --> 01:08:24.237
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what's beneath the surface.</i>

1059
01:08:24.271 --> 01:08:26.507
<i>Maybe no one does.</i>

1060
01:08:26.541 --> 01:08:31.478
<i>But I know it gives us</i>
<i>our deepest desires.</i>

1061
01:08:31.512 --> 01:08:35.883
<i>The people then</i>
<i>must have worshipped it</i>

1062
01:08:35.917 --> 01:08:39.554
when they found out
what it could do.

1063
01:08:41.723 --> 01:08:43.558
<i>Temagami.</i>

1064
01:08:44.692 --> 01:08:47.260
The deep water.

1065
01:08:48.228 --> 01:08:51.599
<i>Temagami. Temagami.</i>

1066
01:08:51.633 --> 01:08:54.434
The well has a wish of its own.

1067
01:08:54.468 --> 01:08:58.438
<i>Once the water is woken,</i>
<i>it will take a life.</i>

1068
01:08:58.472 --> 01:09:02.677
<i>Someone has to pay</i>
<i>so the water can keep giving.</i>

1069
01:09:02.710 --> 01:09:05.145
<i>The way it gave to me.</i>

1070
01:09:06.748 --> 01:09:09.349
Tommy was so sick.

1071
01:09:13.588 --> 01:09:15.422
And look at him now.

1072
01:09:19.927 --> 01:09:22.664
But what happened
to your daughter?

1073
01:09:22.697 --> 01:09:24.666
It was...

1074
01:09:24.699 --> 01:09:27.602
better with Rebecca,

1075
01:09:27.635 --> 01:09:30.571
more humane for a child

1076
01:09:30.605 --> 01:09:32.774
not to know

1077
01:09:32.807 --> 01:09:35.175
what was coming.

1078
01:09:35.777 --> 01:09:37.277
Mom! Help!

1079
01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:40.548
Mom! Mom!

1080
01:09:43.951 --> 01:09:45.553
Mom!

1081
01:09:45.586 --> 01:09:47.689
Becky? Becky!

1082
01:09:47.722 --> 01:09:49.924
Mom! Mom!

1083
01:09:49.957 --> 01:09:51.959
Help!

1084
01:09:51.993 --> 01:09:53.695
Mom, Becky's outside!

1085
01:09:53.728 --> 01:09:56.196
Mom! Mom!

1086
01:09:56.864 --> 01:09:58.833
Mom!

1087
01:09:58.866 --> 01:10:01.501
Mom, Becky's outside!

1088
01:10:01.536 --> 01:10:04.906
<i>The water used me as a vessel</i>

1089
01:10:04.939 --> 01:10:07.809
<i>to do what must be done.</i>

1090
01:10:09.309 --> 01:10:11.713
<i>Don't worry about your husband.</i>

1091
01:10:12.547 --> 01:10:15.817
He's the one who gets the wish.

1092
01:10:15.850 --> 01:10:16.984
He gets his health.

1093
01:10:17.018 --> 01:10:18.853
I got my son back.

1094
01:10:18.886 --> 01:10:20.888
It'll be worth it.

1095
01:10:20.922 --> 01:10:22.724
You'll see.

1096
01:10:22.757 --> 01:10:25.893
Love requires sacrifice.

1097
01:10:25.927 --> 01:10:28.295
That's not love.

1098
01:10:29.362 --> 01:10:33.467
It's not a sacrifice
if you get something back.

1099
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:36.369
Rebecca asked where you were.

1100
01:10:37.505 --> 01:10:39.774
She's still looking for you.

1101
01:10:39.807 --> 01:10:41.743
You can still help us.

1102
01:10:41.776 --> 01:10:45.546
There has to be
some way to stop this.

1103
01:11:26.721 --> 01:11:29.557
It'll be over soon.

1104
01:11:30.925 --> 01:11:34.562
The water will sleep again.

1105
01:11:37.098 --> 01:11:39.366
And...

1106
01:11:39.399 --> 01:11:42.570
someone else
will find the house.

1107
01:11:43.571 --> 01:11:48.543
Someone else who needs its help.

1108
01:12:41.162 --> 01:12:43.764
Thanks, Ronin.
See you tomorrow.

1109
01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:48.468
Hey, Mom, Dad, we're home.

1110
01:12:51.038 --> 01:12:52.640
Mom?

1111
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:56.510
Dad, we're home.

1112
01:12:59.914 --> 01:13:02.482
She's not answering.

1113
01:13:02.516 --> 01:13:05.119
Think Dad might be with her.

1114
01:13:05.152 --> 01:13:07.420
I'm gonna go check the garage.

1115
01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:23.871
Cider?

1116
01:13:35.883 --> 01:13:37.685
Cider?

1117
01:13:42.023 --> 01:13:43.925
Come here, Cider.

1118
01:13:57.939 --> 01:13:59.840
Come here, Cider.

1119
01:14:12.787 --> 01:14:14.522
What?

1120
01:14:24.131 --> 01:14:25.833
Cider?

1121
01:14:40.982 --> 01:14:42.583
It's okay, buddy.

1122
01:14:42.616 --> 01:14:44.852
I'm right here.

1123
01:15:20.821 --> 01:15:22.223
Cider?

1124
01:15:36.737 --> 01:15:38.873
Elliot!

1125
01:15:42.243 --> 01:15:45.679
Elliot! Elliot!

1126
01:15:58.159 --> 01:15:59.794
Mom.

1127
01:15:59.827 --> 01:16:01.796
-Come on. Okay, okay.
-Izzy, help me. Come on.

1128
01:16:11.305 --> 01:16:12.740
I don't know what happened.

1129
01:16:12.773 --> 01:16:13.941
I don't know...
Elliot's down there.

1130
01:16:13.974 --> 01:16:15.342
-All I know is that he...
-Go in the house.

1131
01:16:15.376 --> 01:16:17.044
-Call for help. Go!
-Okay.

1132
01:16:17.078 --> 01:16:19.046
Okay, I'm going.

1133
01:16:29.924 --> 01:16:31.759
Dad!

1134
01:17:38.192 --> 01:17:40.227
Dad?

1135
01:17:56.977 --> 01:17:58.312
Dad!

1136
01:17:58.345 --> 01:18:00.181
There you are.

1137
01:18:00.981 --> 01:18:02.816
I've been looking for you, Iz.

1138
01:18:04.418 --> 01:18:05.853
What's the matter?

1139
01:18:18.365 --> 01:18:21.702
Okay, I'm...
I-I'm calling for help.

1140
01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:27.808
Don't do that!

1141
01:18:48.429 --> 01:18:50.231
I know you want me

1142
01:18:50.264 --> 01:18:51.932
to get better.

1143
01:18:52.967 --> 01:18:54.868
You understand, don't you?

1144
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:58.439
We have to get help.

1145
01:18:58.472 --> 01:19:01.342
Baby, we already got help.

1146
01:19:03.477 --> 01:19:05.779
Life is too hard for Elliot.

1147
01:19:05.813 --> 01:19:07.948
It's better this way.

1148
01:19:10.284 --> 01:19:12.052
Aah!

1149
01:19:22.863 --> 01:19:25.966
Help! Help! Help!

1150
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.434
Marco.

1151
01:20:20.622 --> 01:20:22.189
Help!

1152
01:20:22.222 --> 01:20:24.858
Please! Help!

1153
01:20:24.892 --> 01:20:27.361
Is anyone out there?
Call for help!

1154
01:20:36.236 --> 01:20:38.038

Why don't you stay here,
and it'll all be over soon.

1161
01:22:45.466 --> 01:22:47.267
Ellie.

1162
01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:50.471
Oh, God. Come on.

1163
01:22:50.504 --> 01:22:51.673
Come on, Ellie. Come on.

1164
01:22:51.706 --> 01:22:54.742
One, two, three, four, five.

1165
01:22:54.776 --> 01:22:56.611
Come on. Come on.

1166
01:23:01.148 --> 01:23:02.382
It's too late.

1167
01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:07.354
Love requires sacrifice.

1168
01:23:07.387 --> 01:23:09.022
Ray.

1169
01:23:09.657 --> 01:23:11.191
Oh, Ray, please.

1170
01:23:11.225 --> 01:23:13.628
Please, we need
to get him to a hospital, Ray.

1171
01:23:13.661 --> 01:23:16.163
He needs your help. Look at him.

1172
01:23:23.203 --> 01:23:26.139
The water chose him.

1173
01:23:27.407 --> 01:23:29.644
He loves the pool.

1174
01:23:29.677 --> 01:23:31.646
Elliot will always be here.

1175
01:23:31.679 --> 01:23:34.047
He'll always be here.

1178
01:23:58.873 --> 01:24:00.407
<i>You have to fight it.</i>

1179
01:24:01.876 --> 01:24:03.443
<i>It's going to take sacrifice,</i>

1180
01:24:03.477 --> 01:24:05.547
<i>but you can have</i>
<i>a good life together.</i>

1181
01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:08.683
<i>I just need to know</i>

1182
01:24:08.716 --> 01:24:10.150
<i>Please come back.</i>

1183
01:24:10.183 --> 01:24:11.285
<i>I want that, too.</i>

1184
01:24:11.318 --> 01:24:12.687
<i>Elliot needs you.</i>

1185
01:24:15.455 --> 01:24:16.858
Ray?

1186
01:24:16.891 --> 01:24:18.693
Come back.

1187
01:24:18.726 --> 01:24:20.862
Come back. Come back.

1188
01:24:29.871 --> 01:24:31.639
Izzy, no...

1189
01:24:38.445 --> 01:24:39.781
It's me.

1190
01:24:39.814 --> 01:24:41.315
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1191
01:24:41.348 --> 01:24:43.183
Mom.

1192
01:24:43.216 --> 01:24:45.118
-Ellie!
-Is he okay?

1193
01:24:45.152 --> 01:24:48.455
He's breathing.
We gotta get him out of here.

1194
01:24:49.356 --> 01:24:52.426
Come on. Come on, baby.

1195
01:24:53.393 --> 01:24:55.128
Dad, come on. Let's go.

1196
01:24:56.396 --> 01:24:58.600
<i>Temagami.</i>

1197
01:25:08.342 --> 01:25:10.878
Dad?

1198
01:25:10.912 --> 01:25:12.680
Oh, my God. Mom?

1199
01:25:16.784 --> 01:25:18.586
Baby, what's wrong?

1200
01:25:19.921 --> 01:25:21.656
-Elliot.
-Mom, it's the water.

1201
01:25:21.689 --> 01:25:24.157
It's not gonna let him leave.

1202
01:25:24.191 --> 01:25:25.893
Ray, it's-it's getting worse.

1203
01:25:28.195 --> 01:25:30.698
Get him up, Izzy. Help me.

1204
01:25:32.199 --> 01:25:34.636
Someone has to pay.

1205
01:25:54.287 --> 01:25:55.523
Dad?

1206
01:25:57.825 --> 01:25:59.794
Dad, where are you going?

1207
01:25:59.827 --> 01:26:01.896
Don't look back.

1208
01:26:04.699 --> 01:26:05.800
Ray?

1209
01:26:05.833 --> 01:26:08.168
Dad!

1210
01:26:08.803 --> 01:26:10.605
Dad!

1211
01:26:39.767 --> 01:26:41.468
Ellie!

1212
01:26:42.737 --> 01:26:43.938
Are you okay?

1213
01:26:43.971 --> 01:26:46.507
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

1214
01:26:46.541 --> 01:26:47.742
I'm good.

1215
01:26:47.775 --> 01:26:48.943
I'm okay.

1216
01:26:48.976 --> 01:26:50.277
Where's Dad?

1217
01:27:02.957 --> 01:27:04.458
I got you.

1218
01:27:04.491 --> 01:27:05.793
Okay.

1219
01:27:05.827 --> 01:27:07.695
Okay.

1220
01:27:33.988 --> 01:27:36.356
Hey, Eve, kids.

1221
01:27:36.389 --> 01:27:38.593
Um...

1222
01:27:38.626 --> 01:27:42.429
I-I don't know
what's gonna come of all this,

1223
01:27:42.462 --> 01:27:46.834
but I just feel like
I still got something to prove.

1224
01:27:47.802 --> 01:27:49.904
You know, and...

1225
01:27:49.937 --> 01:27:52.372
I want to make you proud.

1226
01:27:55.076 --> 01:27:57.779
Baseball's always
just come easy to me.

1227
01:27:57.812 --> 01:27:59.547
And...

1228
01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:02.315
the other stuff, not so much.

1229
01:28:03.951 --> 01:28:05.653
So...

1230
01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:09.489
I guess I just...

1231
01:28:10.423 --> 01:28:12.627
...wish I knew a better way

1232
01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:15.696
to let you know
how much you mean to me.

1233
01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:20.701
Love you.

1234
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:31.512
This yours?

1235
01:28:35.850 --> 01:28:38.853
You know,
we could still sell the house.

1236
01:28:39.854 --> 01:28:41.889
I mean, we could go anywhere.

1237
01:28:44.457 --> 01:28:48.495
But then it's going to happen
to someone else, isn't it?

1238
01:28:49.997 --> 01:28:52.332
