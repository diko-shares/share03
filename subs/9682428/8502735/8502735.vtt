My recommendation
is to escalate the diagnosis

he was stabilizing

Yes.

1229
01:05:07.709 --> 01:05:09.243
Come in.

1230
01:05:10.244 --> 01:05:12.446
That's Thomas.

1231
01:05:12.479 --> 01:05:16.083
USAID ambassador in Washington.

1232
01:05:16.116 --> 01:05:19.386
His work in Sudan
saved thousands

1233
01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:22.256
during the refugee crisis.

1234
01:05:22.289 --> 01:05:23.157
Your son?

1235
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:25.527
Yeah. My pride and joy.

1236
01:05:27.027 --> 01:05:30.297
He's responsible
for this beautiful home.

1237
01:05:30.330 --> 01:05:32.634
Though he doesn't visit
as much as I'd like.

1238
01:05:32.667 --> 01:05:34.636
This is about as far

1239
01:05:34.669 --> 01:05:37.404
as I can make it,
if you don't mind.

1240
01:05:37.438 --> 01:05:39.106
Please.

1241
01:05:40.708 --> 01:05:42.476
(air hissing)

1242
01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:46.180
I know this is strange,
but I wanted to ask you about

1243
01:05:46.213 --> 01:05:47.981
when you lived at the house.

1244
01:05:48.015 --> 01:05:49.983
(chuckles):
Oh.

1245
01:05:50.017 --> 01:05:53.187
What a special place. (sighs)

1246
01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:54.455
Tommy loved that pool.

1247
01:05:54.488 --> 01:05:57.926
I could hardly
get him out of the water.

1248
01:05:59.561 --> 01:06:02.362
Did you have a daughter, too?

1249
01:06:05.199 --> 01:06:08.035
No, it's-it's just Thomas and I.

1250
01:06:08.068 --> 01:06:11.739
Oh, he writes
the most wonderful letters.

1251
01:06:11.773 --> 01:06:14.074
He's in Washington,

1252
01:06:14.107 --> 01:06:16.276
doing so much good.

1253
01:06:19.781 --> 01:06:22.650
Mrs. Summers,
I'm not here to upset you.

1254
01:06:22.684 --> 01:06:26.153
But I don't know
who else to talk to.

1255
01:06:27.522 --> 01:06:29.624
My husband was sick,

1256
01:06:29.657 --> 01:06:33.494
and we moved into the house,

1257
01:06:33.528 --> 01:06:35.597
and he started getting better.

1258
01:06:37.331 --> 01:06:39.767
And I think...

1259
01:06:39.801 --> 01:06:42.469
the pool made him better.

1260
01:06:44.672 --> 01:06:48.408
But my kids have seen things.

1261
01:06:49.744 --> 01:06:52.145
And so have I.

1262
01:06:55.550 --> 01:07:00.220
There's something bad
in the water, isn't there?

1263
01:07:03.423 --> 01:07:05.492
(coughing)

1264
01:07:09.697 --> 01:07:12.132
What happened to your daughter?

1265
01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:14.434
To Rebecca?

1266
01:07:14.468 --> 01:07:17.037
(air hissing)

1267
01:07:18.238 --> 01:07:20.307
Please. I'm worried
that the same thing

1268
01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:21.843
is going to happen
to my husband.

1269
01:07:21.876 --> 01:07:24.244
(coughing)

1270
01:07:43.363 --> 01:07:47.134
Did you ever use
a wishing well as a child?

1271
01:07:48.736 --> 01:07:50.838
Throw a coin in the water

1272
01:07:50.872 --> 01:07:55.342
and pray with all your heart.

1273
01:07:58.178 --> 01:08:01.348
Some water is magic.

1274
01:08:11.759 --> 01:08:15.563
Before there was a house

1275
01:08:15.597 --> 01:08:18.165
or a pool...

1276
01:08:18.198 --> 01:08:21.335
<i>there was a spring</i>
<i>in the ground.</i>

1277
01:08:22.369 --> 01:08:24.237
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what's beneath the surface.</i>

1278
01:08:24.271 --> 01:08:26.507
<i>Maybe no one does.</i>

1279
01:08:26.541 --> 01:08:31.478
<i>But I know it gives us</i>
<i>our deepest desires.</i>

1280
01:08:31.512 --> 01:08:35.883
<i>The people then</i>
<i>must have worshipped it</i>

1281
01:08:35.917 --> 01:08:39.554
when they found out
what it could do.

1282
01:08:41.723 --> 01:08:43.558
<i>Temagami.</i>

1283
01:08:44.692 --> 01:08:47.260
The deep water.

1284
01:08:48.228 --> 01:08:51.599
WHISPERING VOICES:
<i>Temagami. Temagami.</i>

1285
01:08:51.633 --> 01:08:54.434

The well has a wish of its own.

1286
01:08:54.468 --> 01:08:58.438
<i>Once the water is woken,</i>
<i>it will take a life.</i>

1287
01:08:58.472 --> 01:09:02.677
<i>Someone has to pay</i>
<i>so the water can keep giving.</i>

1288
01:09:02.710 --> 01:09:05.145
<i>The way it gave to me.</i>

1289
01:09:06.748 --> 01:09:09.349
Tommy was so sick.

1290
01:09:11.619 --> 01:09:13.554

1291

to your daughter?

1294
01:09:24.699 --> 01:09:27.602
better with Rebecca,

1295
01:09:27.635 --> 01:09:30.571
