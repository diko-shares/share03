like them, but…

354
00:16:06.757 --> 00:16:08.175
I'm stuck down here.

355
00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:09.593
Well…

356
00:16:09.677 --> 00:16:11.845

Remember my dad?

359
00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:17.893
He worked at the Wash his whole life.

360
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.483
[Oscar] He was the number one
tongue-scrubber.

361
00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:28.237
Every year for 25 years.

362
00:16:31.156 --> 00:16:33.492
To me, working at the wash

363
00:16:33.617 --> 00:16:36.495
was the coolest job in the ocean.

364
00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:40.082
But then I learned
something I will never forget.

365
00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:41.250

375

back by tomorrow,

A pink pearl?

-Mm-hmm.
-Where'd you get that?

382
00:17:40.267 --> 00:17:42.144
My grandmother gave it to me.

383
00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:47.066
She said it started
from a tiny grain of sand.

384
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:50.277
But then, after a while,

385
00:17:51.028 --> 00:17:53.947
it grew into something beautiful.

That's a fine tradition.
What's the matter with you?

-he's a killer.
-Thanks, Pop.

He does what he's supposed to do.

I'm hearing things.

406

You… You gotta understand,

407
00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:42.913
when you look weak,
it makes me look weak.

you don't even want it.

Here's the thing. I'm on a diet.

422
00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:15.904
I read an article about shrimps.

423
00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:16.989
They're not good for you.

424
00:19:17.114 --> 00:19:20.367
You know how many calories
are in one of those shrimps?

425
00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:22.119
A lot.

426
00:19:22.244 --> 00:19:25.080
It's true, it's true,
and the other thing is,

427
00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:26.373
my sister had a baby,

428
00:19:26.456 --> 00:19:29.042
and I took it over
because she passed away,

429
00:19:29.126 --> 00:19:32.129
and then her baby lost
its legs and its arms,

430
00:19:32.212 --> 00:19:33.505
and now he's nothing but a stump,

431
00:19:33.589 --> 00:19:35.757
but I still take care of him
with my wife,

432
00:19:35.883 --> 00:19:38.552
and it's growing, and it's…

433
00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:41.388
It's fairly happy, but it's difficult

434

a second shift at the factory

-Mm-hmm.

1048
00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:31.734
What did I tell you?

1049
00:43:31.817 --> 00:43:33.402
You kids shouldn't even be doing this.

1050
00:43:33.527 --> 00:43:36.196
And besides, it's not safe
to be out here at night.

1051
00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.657
It is now, bro-bro!
You the Sharkslayer!

1052
00:43:38.741 --> 00:43:39.742
-Yeah, bro.
-Yeah.

1053
00:43:39.825 --> 00:43:41.327
-Sharkslayer?
-What was that?

1054
00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:42.786
[coughing loudly]

1055
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:44.496
Sometimes I'll be
coughing for nothing.

1056
00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:46.165
Look, I just need you
off of these streets.

1057
00:43:46.248 --> 00:43:47.791
-Oh, come on, Oscar.
-Get your butts home.

1058
00:43:47.875 --> 00:43:50.044
I know your moms.
I'm gonna tell 'em y'all doing bad stuff.

1059
00:43:50.127 --> 00:43:52.171
Let's go make Mr. Sykes puff up.

1060
00:43:52.254 --> 00:43:53.255
[both] Yeah!

1061
00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:54.923
-[Shortie 2] Bye, Oscar!
-[Shortie 3] See ya later, dude!

1062
00:43:55.049 --> 00:43:58.093
Lenny! Did you see
what just happened there?

1063
00:43:58.218 --> 00:44:01.221
I know. They think
you're the Sharkslayer.

1064
00:44:01.305 --> 00:44:02.348
As if!

1065
00:44:02.431 --> 00:44:03.557
[laughing]

1066
00:44:03.641 --> 00:44:05.893
I don't appreciate
your funky tone, actually.

1067
00:44:05.976 --> 00:44:07.144
No, wait up! Hey!

1068
00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:08.812
I'm sorry. Seriously.

1069
00:44:08.896 --> 00:44:10.481
I don't want you mad at me,

1070
00:44:10.564 --> 00:44:14.401
and I certainly don't want you
to slay me. [laughing]

1071
00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:15.653
You having a good time, huh?

1072
00:44:15.778 --> 00:44:16.987
You're enjoying yourself?

1073
00:44:18.364 --> 00:44:21.992
Well, for your information,
I am the Sharkslayer!

1074
00:44:22.076 --> 00:44:25.204
Oscar the Sharkslayer.
That's what people be saying.

1075
00:44:26.288 --> 00:44:28.290
Wait. You mean you…

1076
00:44:28.374 --> 00:44:29.541
Yeah.

1077
00:44:29.958 --> 00:44:31.460

[gasps]

1079
00:44:33.754 --> 00:44:35.172
Oh, you're a liar.

1080
00:44:35.255 --> 00:44:37.174
Hey, I didn't lie, all right?

1081
00:44:37.341 --> 00:44:38.425
All right, I lied.

1082
00:44:38.634 --> 00:44:40.594
But it was a little lie!
Come on!

1083
00:44:40.678 --> 00:44:42.096
Who's it gonna hurt anyway?

1084
00:44:42.179 --> 00:44:43.722
Go ahead. I'm not
explaining myself to you.

1085
00:44:43.847 --> 00:44:45.808
-You know what? You're on your own!
-No problem.

1086
00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:51.230
And if, God forbid,
someone should, oh, I don't know,

1087
00:44:51.313 --> 00:44:54.858
find out the truth about the
Sharkslayer on my way back…

1088
00:44:54.983 --> 00:44:56.985
-You wouldn't.
-I would.

1089
00:44:58.654 --> 00:44:59.988
Uh… [clicks tongue]

1090
00:45:00.656 --> 00:45:01.824
[exhales]

1091
00:45:01.907 --> 00:45:03.367
Come here!

1092
00:45:04.118 --> 00:45:07.663
-Of course you can come with me.
-[laughing]

1093
00:45:08.122 --> 00:45:10.332
But, you know, I mean,
you're a shark, right?

1094
00:45:10.416 --> 00:45:11.750
And I'm a sharkslayer.

1095
00:45:11.834 --> 00:45:13.961
So we can't be seen together. [grunts]

1096
00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:15.629
You dig, dog?

1097
00:45:15.712 --> 00:45:16.797
Dig! Dug.

1098
00:45:17.131 --> 00:45:18.424
Dug dig. Dig dog.

1099
00:45:18.507 --> 00:45:20.342
Yeah. Yo, diggy dog!

1100
00:45:20.509 --> 00:45:21.718
Just… Come on!

1101
00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:26.473
[Oscar] Okay, Lenny.

1102
00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:28.809
Follow my every move,
and don't make a sound.

1103
00:45:28.934 --> 00:45:29.935
[Lenny] You got it. [echoes]

1104
00:45:30.018 --> 00:45:31.228

Okay, you wanna be friends? Fine.

1150
00:47:11.245 --> 00:47:12.913
But we gotta lay down some rules.

1151
00:47:13.372 --> 00:47:14.706
Rule number one,

1152
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:19.253
no "snuggly, buggly,"
whatever that just was.

1153
00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:20.796
You got it. Anything else?

1154

All right, rule number two,

1155
00:47:22.172 --> 00:47:24.132
and this is the most important rule.

1156
00:47:24.258 --> 00:47:26.802
In the event that
possibly you get hungry…

1157
00:47:26.927 --> 00:47:28.929
Don't worry. I'm not gonna eat anyone.

1158
00:47:29.012 --> 00:47:30.180
In case you haven't noticed,

1159
00:47:30.264 --> 00:47:32.057
I'm different from the other sharks.

1160
00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:35.227
Let's put it that way,
leave it at that. Good night.

1161
00:47:35.352 --> 00:47:37.354
-Define "different."
-You'll laugh.

1162
00:47:37.437 --> 00:47:38.605
I'm not gonna laugh.

1163
00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:41.692
That's what you say, and then
what happens later? You laugh.

1164
00:47:41.817 --> 00:47:43.110
Lenny, I give you my word.

1165
00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:47.030
Okay. I will tell you.

1170
00:48:00.961 --> 00:48:02.796
[sneezes] What do you mean, "That's it?"

1171
00:48:02.879 --> 00:48:05.048
You're the first fish I ever told.

1172
00:48:05.173 --> 00:48:07.676
I'm so tired of keeping it all a secret.

-Whoa! Hey!

1178
00:48:20.689 --> 00:48:23.734

for what happened.

-Yeah.

out there in the first place,

-Yeah, whatever. Sykes, listen…
-And another thing,

1206
00:49:16.536 --> 00:49:18.914
from now on, you're gonna have
to start paying me protection.

1207
00:49:19.122 --> 00:49:22.793
Sykes, the deal is off.
That shark I killed was Don Lino's son.

1208
00:49:22.918 --> 00:49:24.169
I know. Ain't it great?

1209
00:49:24.252 --> 00:49:25.587
Not if he finds out.

1210
00:49:25.712 --> 00:49:27.714
What do you mean, "Find out"?
I've got him on phone right now.

1211

right here in front of me.

Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.

1213

And he's gonna slay you
and all your sharks.

I've seen it a thousand times.

They take the thing you love the most,
and then they use it against you.

We got to go to that sit-down
and we got to save her.

Whoa, whoa. Look, I wanna save Angie, too,

1618

"Hi, Pop. I'm a dolphin."

This will never work.
We're dead. We're dead.

Shh. Thank you, Sykes. Thank you.

1640
01:07:46.645 --> 01:07:49.231
And my man Sykes has just

1641
01:07:49.857 --> 01:07:53.611
begged me not to murderlize
all y'all up in here, all right?

1642
01:07:54.028 --> 01:07:57.073
Now, I might listen to him,
but then again, I might not.

1643
01:07:57.490 --> 01:07:59.867

on the individual behavior

The taste was killing me.

1737
01:11:20.484 --> 01:11:21.568
-Lenny?
-[gasps]

1738
01:11:22.945 --> 01:11:24.196
Is that you?

1739
01:11:26.824 --> 01:11:28.284
-You're alive?
-Oh.

1740
01:11:28.701 --> 01:11:30.369
I thought I lost you.

1741
01:11:31.787 --> 01:11:34.373
What are you wearing? Huh? What is that?

1742
01:11:48.595 --> 01:11:50.347
Whoa! Ho-ho ho!

1743
01:11:50.597 --> 01:11:52.057
Hey, boss, it's Lenny.

1744
01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:54.476
He was wearing a disguise
so we wouldn't recognize him.

1745
01:11:54.601 --> 01:11:56.729
But now he's not wearing a disguise,

1746
01:11:56.812 --> 01:11:58.731
so we do recognize him.

1747
01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:00.941
Hi, Pop.

1748
01:12:01.025 --> 01:12:02.151
Are you kidding me?

1749
01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:05.237
Are you kidding me?
Are you out of your mind?

1750
01:12:05.362 --> 01:12:07.364
Do you have any idea how this looks?

1751
01:12:08.032 --> 01:12:10.409
This is the best sit-down
I've ever been to.

1752
01:12:10.868 --> 01:12:12.161
What are you doing with this guy?

1753
01:12:12.244 --> 01:12:14.371
He took out your flesh and blood, Frankie.

1754
01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:15.748
Look, Pop, just listen…

1755
01:12:15.873 --> 01:12:19.043
But nothing. You never take sides
against the family. Ever!

1756
01:12:19.126 --> 01:12:20.961
Hey, Don, Lino, sir.

1757
01:12:21.086 --> 01:12:24.298
Listen, it's not his fault.
This is between you and me.

1758
01:12:24.423 --> 01:12:26.008
What did I ever do to you?

1759
01:12:26.216 --> 01:12:27.718
You took Frankie away,

1760
01:12:27.801 --> 01:12:29.803
and you turned Lenny into a dolphin!

1761
01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:32.181
-I'm gonna get you.
-[screams]

1762
01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:33.807
[Angie] Oscar, look out!

1763
01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:36.060
Oscar, swim! Swim for your life!

1764
01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:37.811
[growling]

1765
01:12:44.151 --> 01:12:47.154
You're gonna regret the day
you became the Sharkslayer.

1766
01:12:47.237 --> 01:12:52.201
Well, well, well.
Look who's stuck in the porthole.

1767
01:12:52.326 --> 01:12:54.411
-Huh?
-You still hungry, big guy?

1768
01:12:54.828 --> 01:12:58.040
Well, say hello to my little friends.

1769
01:12:58.749 --> 01:13:00.334
[humming battle charge music]

1770
01:13:02.002 --> 01:13:03.212
[screaming]

1771
01:13:03.337 --> 01:13:04.713
[laughing]

1772
01:13:11.178 --> 01:13:12.304
-Try it again.
-[phone ringing]

1773
01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:14.556
Whale Wash, you get a whale of a wash

1774
01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.225
and the price… Oh, my gosh!

1775
01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:19.520
All right! You got it right.
You got it right.

1776
01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:20.896
Move! Everybody, out of the way!

1777
01:13:24.441 --> 01:13:25.484
Blow out!

1778
01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:26.777
[whales squealing]

1779
01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:35.994
Come on, Lino.
It's time to clean up your act.

1780
01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:39.790
[Don Lino groans]

1781
01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:41.792
Pop, leave him alone!

1782
01:13:42.042 --> 01:13:43.252
[yells]

1783
01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:52.136
All right, Lino, game's over.

1784
01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:55.097
Ah! Ooh!

1785
01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.770
Lenny? What are you doing in there?

1786
01:14:01.937 --> 01:14:03.439
-Sorry.
-Where's Lino?

1787
01:14:04.314 --> 01:14:05.983
He's right behind me, isn't he?

1788
01:14:06.066 --> 01:14:07.443
You're mine now.

1789
01:14:07.568 --> 01:14:08.735
[screams]

1790
01:14:16.243 --> 01:14:17.244
Whoa!

1791
01:14:20.164 --> 01:14:21.748
Let's finish this, Sharkslayer.

1792
01:14:21.874 --> 01:14:23.208
Oh, we're about to.

1793
01:14:28.672 --> 01:14:29.965
[shouting in slo-mo]

1794
01:14:39.057 --> 01:14:40.058
[screams]

1795
01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:43.395
[machinery powering down]

1796
01:14:49.735 --> 01:14:51.445
[music playing on headphones]

1797
01:14:51.528 --> 01:14:53.489
Thank you for coming to Whale Wash.

1798
01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:55.908
[crowd chattering]

1799
01:14:56.867 --> 01:15:01.455
Okay, somebody needs
to get me out of the bubble, today.

1800
01:15:01.997 --> 01:15:03.540
-Ooh.
-[crowd cheering]

1801
01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:05.876
-Angie…
-The Sharkslayer has done it again.

1802
01:15:05.959 --> 01:15:09.838
This time luring two sharks
into his deathtrap of hygiene.

1803
01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:12.883
Oscar, you're the somebody
everybody wants to be.

1804
01:15:12.966 --> 01:15:14.760
-The top of the food chain.
-No, no…

1805
01:15:14.885 --> 01:15:16.470
-Tell our cameras how it feels to be you.
-Angie…

1806
01:15:16.553 --> 01:15:17.513
Angie!

1807
01:15:17.596 --> 01:15:19.765
Oscar, get me out here. Quick.
I need to get a head start

1808
01:15:19.848 --> 01:15:21.642
so I can get as far away as possible.

1809
01:15:21.725 --> 01:15:22.809
Look what you did to him.

1810
01:15:22.893 --> 01:15:24.436
Wait, no! It's all a big misunderstanding.

1811
01:15:24.561 --> 01:15:26.438
-Sharkslayer, over here.
-If you'd just…

1812
01:15:26.563 --> 01:15:30.025
[all chanting] Sharkslayer!
Sharkslayer! Sharkslayer!

1813
01:15:30.150 --> 01:15:31.485
Sharkslayer! Sharkslayer!

1814
01:15:31.568 --> 01:15:33.362
Stop!

1815
01:15:33.445 --> 01:15:37.991
[shouting] I am not a real sharkslayer!

1816
01:15:38.075 --> 01:15:39.618
[crowd quiets down]

1817
01:15:45.457 --> 01:15:47.084
I lied.

1818
01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:48.418
What?

1819
01:15:48.752 --> 01:15:51.672
And I'm not a real financial adviser.

1820
01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:53.549
[sobbing]

1821
01:15:54.007 --> 01:15:55.342
Okay. [clears throat]

1822
01:15:55.509 --> 01:15:57.386
It was an anchor that killed Frankie.

1823
01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.513
I didn't have anything to do with it,

1824
01:15:59.596 --> 01:16:00.597
and neither did Lenny.

1825
01:16:00.722 --> 01:16:03.267
If that was true, why did you run away?

1826
01:16:03.850 --> 01:16:06.478
Because you always wanted me
to be like Frankie.

1827
01:16:07.437 --> 01:16:09.439
I'll never be the shark you want me to be.

1828
01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.484
What is your problem?

1829
01:16:12.609 --> 01:16:14.403
So your son likes kelp.

1830
01:16:14.486 --> 01:16:16.238
So his best friend's a fish.

1831
01:16:16.321 --> 01:16:19.199
So he likes to dress like a dolphin.

1832
01:16:19.324 --> 01:16:20.576
So what?

1833
01:16:21.034 --> 01:16:22.828
Everybody loves him

1834
01:16:22.911 --> 01:16:24.204
just the way he is.

1835
01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:26.748
Why can't you?

1836
01:16:29.543 --> 01:16:31.420
Don't make the same mistake that I did.

1837
01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:35.507
I didn't know what I had until I lost it.

1838
01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:43.765
Will you get me out of this?

1839
01:16:43.890 --> 01:16:46.977
So I can hug my kid
and tell him I'm sorry.

1840
01:16:47.894 --> 01:16:48.979
Pop.

1841
01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:56.194
Come here, you.

1842
01:16:58.488 --> 01:17:00.782
I love you, son, no matter what you eat

1843
01:17:00.991 --> 01:17:02.743
or how you dress.

1844
01:17:04.411 --> 01:17:05.746
[Angie] Oscar?

1845
01:17:05.912 --> 01:17:07.205
Angie?

1846
01:17:12.628 --> 01:17:14.504
[sighs] Angie.

1847
01:17:15.922 --> 01:17:17.841
I wish I knew now what I knew then.

1848
01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:20.927
I mean, I wish you knew what I knew…

1849
01:17:21.011 --> 01:17:23.013
Uh, I mean, before this.

1850
01:17:23.263 --> 01:17:24.681
You're blowing it, man!

1851
01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:27.726
Mind your business.
It's emotional and it's pressure.

1852
01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:30.812
What I'm saying, I just…

1853
01:17:31.396 --> 01:17:33.440
I didn't need the top of the reef.

1854
01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:36.568
Everything I wanted
was right there in front of me

1855
01:17:37.277 --> 01:17:38.445
the whole time.

1856
01:17:39.071 --> 01:17:41.490
Well, what about being a somebody?

1857
01:17:42.699 --> 01:17:44.368
I'm nobody without you.

1858
01:17:52.459 --> 01:17:53.835
[kissing]

1859
01:17:53.919 --> 01:17:56.046
[chuckles] You're not helping.

1860
01:17:56.963 --> 01:17:58.256
[chuckles]

1861
01:17:58.423 --> 01:18:01.718
Oh, come here, you big dumb dummy-head.

1862

[crowd cheering]

1863
01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:08.100
I never told you two this,

1864
01:18:08.183 --> 01:18:10.686
but you're the best henchmen
a guy ever had.

1865
01:18:10.769 --> 01:18:12.270
Come on. Group hug.

1866
01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:14.606
-Ow! Hey!
-Sorry, mon. Sorry.

1867
01:18:14.731 --> 01:18:16.650
Come, Sykes, try again, mon. Go for it.

1868
01:18:16.775 --> 01:18:18.193
Oh, forget it. The moment's gone.

1869
01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:20.737
So, uh, Lino…

1870
01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:22.823
Uh, Don… [chuckles]

1871
01:18:23.156 --> 01:18:25.534
We cool, right? I mean,
like, the reef is safe.

1872
01:18:25.617 --> 01:18:28.662
You know, walk the streets, you know,
without… Aah! You know.

1873
01:18:29.413 --> 01:18:31.123
Yeah. We're cool.

1875
01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:35.752
[Katie] Oscar, excuse me. Oscar.

1876
01:18:35.836 --> 01:18:38.755
You've lost everything
you lied so hard to achieve.

1877
01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.799
Tell me, what's next for you?

1878
01:18:43.427 --> 01:18:45.011
Come on. Everyone's waiting,

1879
01:18:45.512 --> 01:18:47.347
Mr. Manager.

1880
01:18:47.472 --> 01:18:50.058
Just got to put the finishing touch
on my new desk.

1881
01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:51.435
Love you, Pop.

1882
01:18:52.811 --> 01:18:54.438
-Yo, dog!
-Sykes!

1883
01:18:54.521 --> 01:18:56.565
All right, partner,
let's see what you can do.
