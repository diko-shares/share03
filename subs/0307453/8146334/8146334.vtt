00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:07.873
Hi. I'm Lenny.

2
00:01:09.594 --> 00:01:12.086
Oh, little buddy,
did I scare ya? I'm sorry.

3
00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:14.262
Wake up. Wake up. Okay.

4
00:01:14.348 --> 00:01:16.556
Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna get you out in a jiffy.

5
00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:18.370
You just keep holding your
breath, little wormy.

6
00:01:18.394 --> 00:01:19.635
- Yo, Lenny!
- Uh...

7
00:01:19.812 --> 00:01:20.893
I'm coming, Frankie!

8
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.188
Well, move it! Come on.
Pop's waiting.

9
00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:25.223
Here we go. And... Gotcha!

10
00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:27.059
Okay, buddy. You're free.
Now escape. Go.

11
00:01:27.445 --> 00:01:28.606
Just go. Cry freedom.

12
00:01:28.738 --> 00:01:30.229
Oh.

13
00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:31.946
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

14
00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:33.073
Lenny, what are you doing?

15
00:01:33.117 --> 00:01:35.359
What? I... I was just, uh...

16
00:01:36.287 --> 00:01:37.368
Picking you flowers.

17
00:01:37.955 --> 00:01:39.742
Hey. Mom said
it's not okay to hit.

18
00:01:40.916 --> 00:01:42.498
Mom's not here.

19
00:01:42.627 --> 00:01:44.493
<i>Dah-dum, dah-dum</i>

20
00:01:44.587 --> 00:01:45.587
Don't.

21
00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:46.732
<i>Dah-nah dah-nah
Dah-nah dah-nah</i>

22
00:01:46.756 --> 00:01:47.792
Don't!

23
00:01:47.882 --> 00:01:48.882
<i>Buh-nah-bun-nah</i>

24
00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:50.878
That song gives me
the creeps.

25
00:01:50.968 --> 00:01:52.800
What do you mean?
It's our theme song.

26
00:02:17.745 --> 00:02:19.737
<i>Are they gone? Are they gone?</i>

27
00:02:19.872 --> 00:02:21.079
<i>You sure?</i>

28
00:02:21.624 --> 00:02:23.411
<i>Good morning, Southside Reef.</i>

29
00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:25.618
<i>I'm Katie Current,
keeping it current.</i>

30
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.661
<i>We've just received
official confirmation.</i>

31
00:02:27.755 --> 00:02:29.371
<i>The sharks are gone.</i>

32
00:02:29.507 --> 00:02:31.339
<i>I repeat, the sharks are gone.</i>

33
00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:33.091
<i>Don't worry</i>

34
00:02:33.928 --> 00:02:35.169
<i>About a thing</i>

35
00:02:36.972 --> 00:02:38.429
<i>'Cause every little thing</i>

36
00:02:38.516 --> 00:02:40.257
<i>Is gonna be all right</i>

37
00:02:41.936 --> 00:02:42.972
<i>Don't worry</i>

38
00:02:44.105 --> 00:02:45.721
<i>About a thing</i>

39
00:02:47.274 --> 00:02:50.392
<i>'Cause every little thing
Is gonna be all right</i>

40
00:02:50.486 --> 00:02:52.193
Mussel Crowe!

41
00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:53.770
Jessica Shrimpson!

42
00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:55.442
Cod Stewart!

43
00:02:58.494 --> 00:03:00.281
<i>Up next,
a mother of 800</i>

44
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:02.112
<i>tells us how she does it all.</i>

45
00:03:02.206 --> 00:03:04.994
<i>But first, over to Janice
for the traffic report.</i>

46
00:03:05.126 --> 00:03:06.186
Thanks, Katie.

47
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.452
Slight congestion
here on the Interreef 95.

48
00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:09.648
There's an overturned
mackerel.

49
00:03:09.672 --> 00:03:11.538
Authorities are trying to
calm him down.

50
00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:14.466
Get out those shell phones

51
00:03:14.552 --> 00:03:17.010
and call into the boss
'cause you'll be late.

52
00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.341
Don't you yell at me!
My mother is your mother, okay?

53
00:03:41.078 --> 00:03:42.444
Yeah. It's fake.

54
00:03:42.538 --> 00:03:45.121
Fake? I worked eight years
on that!

55
00:03:57.762 --> 00:03:58.762
Oh!

56
00:03:59.638 --> 00:04:01.425
<i>According to the
latest scallop poll,</i>

57
00:04:01.515 --> 00:04:03.632
<i>fear of sharks is at
an all-time high.</i>

58
00:04:03.768 --> 00:04:06.135
<i>Join us tonight for an
in-depth report.</i>

59
00:04:06.353 --> 00:04:09.096
<i>How long must this reef
live under siege?</i>

60
00:04:09.356 --> 00:04:11.598
<i>Is there no hero among us?</i>

61
00:04:11.734 --> 00:04:14.647
<i>Who can stop
this shark menace?</i>

62
00:04:15.654 --> 00:04:16.861
Hi. I'm Oscar.

63
00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.573
You might think you know,
but you have no idea.

64
00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:24.661
Welcome to my crib.

65
00:04:24.747 --> 00:04:27.455
The good life.
The way the other half lives.

66
00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:30.041
Check it out. I got my 60-inch
Hi-Def flat-screen TV

67
00:04:30.127 --> 00:04:32.039
with six-speaker Surround.

68
00:04:32.213 --> 00:04:33.579
CD, DVD, PlayStation hookup,

69
00:04:33.672 --> 00:04:35.334
and a 8-track player
for those days

70
00:04:35.466 --> 00:04:36.957
when you're feeling
just a little...

71
00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:39.418
...old school.

72
00:04:41.096 --> 00:04:43.554
'Cause even a superstar,
Mack Daddy fish like me

73
00:04:43.682 --> 00:04:46.049
has to have the basic
necessities.

74
00:04:46.143 --> 00:04:48.601
Yeah. Like money.

75
00:04:48.687 --> 00:04:50.916
Come on, shorties.
Why y'all messing with my fantasy?

76
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.058
'Cause you so broke,
your bologna has no first name.

77
00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:57.311
Oh, that's funny.
That's very funny.

78
00:04:57.404 --> 00:04:59.942
Hey, Oscar! Oscar! Over here!

79
00:05:00.032 --> 00:05:01.489
I gotta talk to ya!

80
00:05:01.617 --> 00:05:03.654
I'll be right there.
Hang on to these for me.

81
00:05:03.786 --> 00:05:06.028
- Oscar, you da fish.
- Yo, dude.

82
00:05:06.956 --> 00:05:08.868
Yo, Crazy Joe.

83
00:05:09.458 --> 00:05:11.199
Now that you live in
a great penthouse,

84
00:05:11.335 --> 00:05:13.497
can I be your
financial adviser?

85
00:05:13.921 --> 00:05:15.457
That's a billboard, Crazy Joe.

86
00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:17.080
You live in a billboard?

87
00:05:17.174 --> 00:05:19.666
- No.
- And they call me crazy.

88
00:05:22.137 --> 00:05:24.470
Hey, Oscar,
look who came to visit.

89
00:05:25.641 --> 00:05:27.507
- Gotcha!
- No. Don't do that.

90
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.096
Shouldn't you kids
be in school?

91
00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:30.639
Shouldn't you be at work?

92
00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.971
Ooh, right back at me, huh?
Little smart mouth.

93
00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:35.565
I'm on my way.
Y'all stay outta trouble.

94
00:05:35.901 --> 00:05:37.483
And clean that stuff up.

95
00:05:37.611 --> 00:05:38.897
See ya.

96
00:05:43.117 --> 00:05:45.200
See you, Oscar.

97
00:05:51.792 --> 00:05:52.953
Ooh!

98
00:06:03.888 --> 00:06:04.969
Yo, yo. What's up?

99
00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:06.880
Big O's in the house.

100
00:06:06.974 --> 00:06:08.431
Hi, Oscar.

101
00:06:10.644 --> 00:06:12.306
- Hey! Hi, Oscar.
- What's up?

102
00:06:14.523 --> 00:06:16.185
Hey. Psych!

103
00:06:16.275 --> 00:06:17.982
Yo, Johnson, is it lunch yet?

104
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.396
You just got here.

105
00:06:19.528 --> 00:06:21.269
That's the point.

106
00:06:24.867 --> 00:06:26.654
Hey, Headphone Guy.

107
00:06:28.954 --> 00:06:30.286
Yeah.

108
00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:32.114
Looking good, ladies.

109
00:06:32.207 --> 00:06:33.869
- Hey, Oscar.
- Unh, unh, unh.

110
00:06:34.418 --> 00:06:35.829
Keep up the bad work.

111
00:06:37.838 --> 00:06:39.374
Huh?

112
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:41.877
I'm already punched in?

113
00:06:41.967 --> 00:06:43.708
Angie.

114
00:06:43.844 --> 00:06:46.086
Good morning. Can I help you?

115
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.796
One wash and lube, please.

116
00:06:47.932 --> 00:06:49.173
- Hot wax?
- Please.

117
00:06:49.308 --> 00:06:51.369
Kelp scrape? We're having a
special. What do you say?

118
00:06:51.393 --> 00:06:53.305
Why not? It's mating season.

119
00:06:53.687 --> 00:06:56.054
And I'm feeling lucky.

120
00:06:56.148 --> 00:06:58.640
Sykes Whale Wash.
Whale of a wash, and the price...

121
00:06:59.735 --> 00:07:00.851
Oh, my gosh.

122
00:07:02.071 --> 00:07:03.687
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.

123
00:07:03.781 --> 00:07:05.522
Oh. May I suggest
a barnacle peel?

124
00:07:05.616 --> 00:07:06.982
Removes lines
and salt damage.

125
00:07:07.117 --> 00:07:08.403
- Good.
- Hey, Ang.

126
00:07:08.494 --> 00:07:10.577
Oh, my gosh!
Hi, Oscar.

127
00:07:10.663 --> 00:07:12.074
Thanks for covering for me.

128
00:07:12.164 --> 00:07:14.907
Yo. I'm sorry. Angie
needs to get her freak on.

129
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.957
Would you hold for
one moment, please?

130
00:07:17.044 --> 00:07:18.251
- Thanks, dog.
- Oscar.

131
00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:20.166
Come on, Ang.
Dance with me, Mama.

132
00:07:20.255 --> 00:07:21.291
Let me see it.

133
00:07:21.423 --> 00:07:23.380
Oh!

134
00:07:23.467 --> 00:07:24.548
- Come on, Ang.
- Oscar.

135
00:07:24.677 --> 00:07:26.088
You're gonna get me fired.

136
00:07:26.303 --> 00:07:27.714
Please. You fired?

137
00:07:27.805 --> 00:07:28.921
Nah. That can't happen.

138
00:07:29.014 --> 00:07:32.507
'Cause I would have absolutely
no reason to come to work.

139
00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:34.718
Oh. You don't mean that.

140
00:07:35.145 --> 00:07:36.386
Of course I do.

141
00:07:36.605 --> 00:07:38.016
You're, like, my best friend.

142
00:07:40.943 --> 00:07:42.059
Oh, listen.

143
00:07:42.152 --> 00:07:43.338
Tell me what you
think about this.

144
00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:46.150
This is, like, the best
idea ever. All right?

145
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:49.399
It's a sure thing,
guaranteed cash extravaganza.

146
00:07:51.036 --> 00:07:52.948
Bottled water.

147
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.662
- Oh, no.
- All I need

148
00:07:54.748 --> 00:07:56.740
is another advance on
my paycheck from the boss,

149
00:07:56.834 --> 00:07:58.871
and I am outta this place.

150
00:07:58.961 --> 00:08:00.452
I'm, I'm...

151
00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:01.878
Oscar...

152
00:08:01.964 --> 00:08:03.956
Instead of getting in
Mr. Sykes's face

153
00:08:04.049 --> 00:08:06.041
with another one of your
get-rich-quick schemes,

154
00:08:06.135 --> 00:08:07.751
go do something
you're good at.

155
00:08:07.928 --> 00:08:09.510
- What?
- Your job.

156
00:08:09.596 --> 00:08:11.929
Which, by some miracle,
you still have.

157
00:08:12.099 --> 00:08:13.099
Oh.

158
00:08:13.892 --> 00:08:15.178
Almost forgot.

159
00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:17.553
I brought you some breakfast.

160
00:08:17.688 --> 00:08:19.475
- You didn't.
- Mmm-hmm.

161
00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:21.181
- Kelpy Kremes?
- Your favorite.

162
00:08:21.316 --> 00:08:22.316
Oh, by the way...

163
00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:23.812
You're still on hold.

164
00:08:23.902 --> 00:08:25.109
Oh, my gosh!

165
00:08:25.195 --> 00:08:27.107
Thank you for holding.
Busy, busy, busy.

166
00:08:27.239 --> 00:08:29.151
Go! How can I help you?

167
00:08:30.367 --> 00:08:31.483
Mm-mm-mm-mm.

168
00:08:33.787 --> 00:08:36.530
No. I'm sorry. Mr. Sykes
is at a meeting right now.

169
00:08:36.623 --> 00:08:38.285
Won't be back till later.

170
00:08:45.674 --> 00:08:48.508
How are my
little babies this morning?

171
00:08:48.594 --> 00:08:49.880
You miss me?

172
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.197
You doing good?

173
00:08:51.221 --> 00:08:53.053
Huh? Huh?

174
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.972
You see, Sykes,

175
00:08:55.642 --> 00:08:58.009
it's a fish-eat-fish world.

176
00:08:58.103 --> 00:09:00.470
You either take
or you get taken.

177
00:09:05.277 --> 00:09:06.813
Truer words have
never been spoken.

178
00:09:06.904 --> 00:09:08.361
Is that it?
That all? We done?

179
00:09:08.489 --> 00:09:10.105
You and me,
we worked together

180
00:09:10.199 --> 00:09:12.407
a long, long, long time.

181
00:09:12.534 --> 00:09:14.446
Please, Don Lino,
it's hardly been work.

182
00:09:14.578 --> 00:09:16.556
- Let me finish. And you know...
- I love that about you...

183
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.866
Let me finish!

184
00:09:18.123 --> 00:09:20.206
...that I've lived my life
for my sons,

185
00:09:20.334 --> 00:09:22.326
raising them
and protecting them...

186
00:09:22.419 --> 00:09:23.897
- You're the best!
- ...teaching them...

187
00:09:23.921 --> 00:09:25.878
- Am I right or wrong?
- Sykes.

188
00:09:26.006 --> 00:09:27.838
- It's all been to prepare...
- Right?

189
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.152
- To prepare them...
- Sorry.

190
00:09:29.176 --> 00:09:30.176
Yeah. It's all right.

191
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.752
...for the day
they run the reef.

192
00:09:33.514 --> 00:09:35.927
Well, today is that day.

193
00:09:39.353 --> 00:09:40.469
Luca.

194
00:09:42.397 --> 00:09:45.310
<i>I like big butts And
I cannot lie...</i>

195
00:09:46.902 --> 00:09:48.689
Hey, boss. Big butts.

196
00:09:50.572 --> 00:09:51.813
Oy vey!

197
00:09:52.574 --> 00:09:53.985
Long story short,

198
00:09:54.076 --> 00:09:57.035
from now on, yous work
for Frankie and Lenny.

199
00:09:57.162 --> 00:09:58.903
<i>Capisce?</i>

200
00:09:59.081 --> 00:10:00.538
Lenny? Frankie, I understand,

201
00:10:00.624 --> 00:10:02.456
but Lenny?
You can't be serious.

202
00:10:02.584 --> 00:10:03.584
I'm dead serious.

203
00:10:03.669 --> 00:10:05.501
It takes more
than muscle to run things.

204
00:10:05.587 --> 00:10:07.704
Now Lenny,
he's got the brains.

205
00:10:07.965 --> 00:10:09.297
That's something special.

206
00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.830
oh, yeah.
He's special all right.

207
00:10:10.884 --> 00:10:11.986
What's that
supposed to mean?

208
00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.154
- Nothing. I'm just saying.
- Hey!

209
00:10:13.178 --> 00:10:14.840
I bring you in here,

210
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.922
look you in the eye,
tell you what's what,

211
00:10:17.015 --> 00:10:18.051
and what?

212
00:10:18.559 --> 00:10:20.016
- What?
- What, "What"?

213
00:10:20.144 --> 00:10:21.704
Nothing.
You said, "What," first.

214
00:10:21.728 --> 00:10:23.640
I didn't say "What" first.
I asked you, "What?"

215
00:10:23.772 --> 00:10:25.855
You said, "And then what?"
and I said, "What?"

216
00:10:25.983 --> 00:10:28.316
I said, "What what?"
Like what what?

217
00:10:30.028 --> 00:10:31.064
You said, "What" first.

218
00:10:31.196 --> 00:10:33.174
- You're making fun of me?
- No. You misunderstood.

219
00:10:33.198 --> 00:10:36.282
Sorry we're late, Pop.
Lenny had an accident.

220
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:37.410
He was born.

221
00:10:38.745 --> 00:10:39.906
You're a comic genius.

222
00:10:40.038 --> 00:10:41.370
Look, all I'm saying is,

223
00:10:41.456 --> 00:10:42.822
the kid ain't exactly
no killer.

224
00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.870
My Lenny is a killer.
You hear me?

225
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.246
A cold-blooded killer.

226
00:10:46.378 --> 00:10:48.165
Look at him.

227
00:10:50.549 --> 00:10:51.710
Huh?

228
00:10:53.886 --> 00:10:55.843
That's it. That's it!

229
00:10:55.929 --> 00:10:57.170
You are out!

230
00:10:57.306 --> 00:10:58.387
What?

231
00:10:59.349 --> 00:11:01.369
- What do you mean I'm out?
- You're fired!

232
00:11:04.021 --> 00:11:05.353
And on top of that,

233
00:11:05.439 --> 00:11:06.896
you're gonna have to
start paying me!

234
00:11:07.024 --> 00:11:08.024
For what?

235
00:11:08.108 --> 00:11:10.475
So nothing happens to that
little whale wash of yours.

236
00:11:10.986 --> 00:11:12.943
Welcome to Oscar's crib.

237
00:11:13.572 --> 00:11:16.986
Sixty-foot slime-covered
tongue with canker sores,

238
00:11:17.075 --> 00:11:18.407
swim-in cavities,

239
00:11:18.535 --> 00:11:21.494
and plankton-encrusted teeth
for when I feel a little...

240
00:11:22.706 --> 00:11:24.163
...old school.

241
00:11:24.249 --> 00:11:27.208
Stop your moaning, Oscar.
It could be a lot worse.

242
00:11:27.336 --> 00:11:28.336
Yeah, that's true.

243
00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:31.538
I could have this job,
and look like you.

244
00:11:31.632 --> 00:11:34.295
Who's behind me? Whoever
behind me, better give me some.

245
00:11:38.513 --> 00:11:39.845
Indigestion.

246
00:11:40.265 --> 00:11:42.632
She's gonna blow!

247
00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:44.885
Wait! Headphone Guy's
still in there.

248
00:11:47.105 --> 00:11:49.438
I got you!

249
00:11:49.524 --> 00:11:51.356
Headphone Guy!

250
00:12:01.328 --> 00:12:02.910
Still think it could be worse?

251
00:12:03.038 --> 00:12:05.405
Yeah. I could look like you.

252
00:12:05.624 --> 00:12:07.331
Y'all funny.

253
00:12:07.417 --> 00:12:08.953
Well, see if you
laugh at this!

254
00:12:16.885 --> 00:12:18.046
My eye!

255
00:12:18.136 --> 00:12:20.298
Soap in the eye!
Soap in the eye!

256
00:12:26.937 --> 00:12:29.224
It's all right. I'm gonna
get you some coupons.

257
00:12:29.314 --> 00:12:32.057
We gonna get you a free hot wax
and all that. You like that?

258
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:33.211
All right, go ahead,
big baby.

259
00:12:33.235 --> 00:12:34.567
Thanks, Oscar.

260
00:12:34.695 --> 00:12:36.778
- All right.
- Look who it is, Bernie.

261
00:12:36.905 --> 00:12:39.648
- Just the fish we're looking for.
- Yeah.

262
00:12:39.741 --> 00:12:41.573
The boss be needing
to see you right now.

263
00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.660
Right now.

264
00:12:42.786 --> 00:12:45.745
Ernie, Bernie, my jellyfish brothers.
Boo-ya-ka!

265
00:12:45.872 --> 00:12:49.536
Hey, what's up, man?
Man, it's good to see y'all. Huh?

266
00:12:49.668 --> 00:12:52.206
What'd you say, Ang?
Oh, okay.

267
00:12:52.379 --> 00:12:54.712
Fellas, I'm gonna go
over there, but, uh...

268
00:12:54.798 --> 00:12:56.585
<i>Don't worry</i>

269
00:12:57.342 --> 00:12:59.004
<i>About a thing</i>

270
00:13:00.887 --> 00:13:04.130
<i>'Cause every little thing
Is gonna be all right</i>

271
00:13:04.224 --> 00:13:06.466
That's not the way
you sing that song, mon.

272
00:13:10.897 --> 00:13:12.809
Ah! Sykes!

273
00:13:13.066 --> 00:13:14.898
My brother
from another mother!

274
00:13:15.027 --> 00:13:16.643
What the deezy, baby?

275
00:13:16.737 --> 00:13:18.194
Unh. Show me that. Unh.

276
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.340
So, unh, what's going down?

277
00:13:19.364 --> 00:13:21.401
Hey, baby, this is
all gravy today.

278
00:13:21.533 --> 00:13:23.365
Snap your fin.
On the... Snap it!

279
00:13:23.452 --> 00:13:25.409
- Oscar. Oscar!
- You're not snapping it.

280
00:13:25.746 --> 00:13:27.783
Don't sweat it.
A lot of whitefish can't do it.

281
00:13:27.873 --> 00:13:28.954
Would you just sit down?

282
00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:30.041
Ooh. Thank you.

283
00:13:30.167 --> 00:13:31.954
Look, I've been going
over my markers.

284
00:13:32.044 --> 00:13:33.330
You're in to me
for five grand.

285
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.501
Five G's, okay?

286
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:36.086
Five G's? Man, you tripping!

287
00:13:36.173 --> 00:13:37.173
Five G's.

288
00:13:37.299 --> 00:13:39.211
See if this refreshes
your memory.

289
00:13:39.301 --> 00:13:40.792
Wha...

290
00:13:41.428 --> 00:13:43.215
That's crazy. Look at that!

291
00:13:43.722 --> 00:13:47.090
You wrote everything down
so you wouldn't forget.

292
00:13:47.225 --> 00:13:49.057
Wow. This is a perfect example

293
00:13:49.144 --> 00:13:52.353
of why you're in management
and I'm not. You go, boy.

294
00:13:52.439 --> 00:13:54.476
I have to start paying
Don Lino protection.

295
00:13:54.566 --> 00:13:56.182
Everything you owe me,
you owe him.

296
00:13:56.318 --> 00:13:57.729
- How you figure that?
- Simple.

297
00:13:57.819 --> 00:13:59.105
The food chain.

298
00:13:59.237 --> 00:14:01.132
- You see, on top, there's Don Lino.
- Right.

299
00:14:01.156 --> 00:14:02.633
- There's me, and there's regular fish.
- Mmm-hmm.

300
00:14:02.657 --> 00:14:04.114
- Oh, that's me.
- No.

301
00:14:05.035 --> 00:14:07.152
There's plankton,
there's single-cell amoebas.

302
00:14:07.245 --> 00:14:08.361
Then there's me.

303
00:14:08.455 --> 00:14:09.735
I'm getting there.
There's coral.

304
00:14:09.831 --> 00:14:12.494
There's rocks,
there's whale poo,

305
00:14:12.584 --> 00:14:13.665
and then there's you.

306
00:14:14.461 --> 00:14:15.542
That's messed up.

307
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.411
So, if Don Lino's
squeezing me,

308
00:14:17.923 --> 00:14:19.043
- he's squeezing you!
- What?

309
00:14:19.341 --> 00:14:21.048
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

310
00:14:21.134 --> 00:14:22.134
Easy, boss.

311
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.001
- Find your happy place.
- Happy place.

312
00:14:24.137 --> 00:14:25.697
There is no happy place
with him around.

313
00:14:25.806 --> 00:14:27.492
I'm serious!

314
00:14:27.516 --> 00:14:29.803
Okay! Okay! Please,
just give me some time.

315
00:14:29.893 --> 00:14:30.893
That's all I'm asking.

316
00:14:30.977 --> 00:14:33.264
I'm begging you,
Sykes. Please!

317
00:14:33.563 --> 00:14:34.563
Please!

318
00:14:37.109 --> 00:14:38.316
All right.

319
00:14:39.444 --> 00:14:40.505
'Cause I like you,

320
00:14:40.529 --> 00:14:42.486
I'm gonna give you
24 hours to pay up.

321
00:14:42.572 --> 00:14:44.780
All of it? How am I
supposed to do that?

322
00:14:44.908 --> 00:14:45.908
That's your problem.

323
00:14:45.992 --> 00:14:48.450
Bring my 5,000 clams to the
racetrack tomorrow, or else.

324
00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:49.620
Or else what?

325
00:14:49.746 --> 00:14:51.032
The boys'll explain.

326
00:14:54.418 --> 00:14:56.330
Unpleasant.

327
00:14:56.753 --> 00:15:00.167
Five thousand clams?

328
00:15:00.924 --> 00:15:04.133
You borrowed 5,000 clams
from Mr. Sykes?

329
00:15:04.511 --> 00:15:08.380
Oscar, why do you get yourself
into these situations?

330
00:15:08.515 --> 00:15:10.131
I don't know, Ang.

331
00:15:11.393 --> 00:15:13.635
It's just hard. All right?
Because, um...

332
00:15:13.854 --> 00:15:16.346
I'm a little fish
in a big pond.

333
00:15:16.731 --> 00:15:19.394
A really big pond. The ocean.

334
00:15:22.362 --> 00:15:23.603
I'm a nobody.

335
00:15:24.489 --> 00:15:25.696
I want some of that.

336
00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:27.986
- Mrs. Sanchez?
- What?

337
00:15:30.912 --> 00:15:33.325
Ew! No. That.

338
00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:35.615
The top of the reef.

339
00:15:36.293 --> 00:15:38.034
Where the somebodies live.

340
00:15:39.129 --> 00:15:42.372
I wanna be rich and famous
like them, but...

341
00:15:42.757 --> 00:15:44.168
I'm stuck down here.

342
00:15:44.384 --> 00:15:45.384
Well...

343
00:15:45.677 --> 00:15:47.168
What's wrong with down here?

344
00:15:47.929 --> 00:15:49.636
I'll tell you what's wrong
with down here.

345
00:15:50.348 --> 00:15:51.384
Remember my dad?

346
00:15:51.475 --> 00:15:53.888
He worked at the Wash
his whole life.

347
00:15:57.731 --> 00:16:00.474
<i>He was the number one
tongue-scrubber.</i>

348
00:16:01.485 --> 00:16:04.228
<i>Every year for 25 years.</i>

349
00:16:07.157 --> 00:16:09.490
<i>To me, working at the wash</i>

350
00:16:09.618 --> 00:16:12.486
<i>was the coolestjob in
the ocean.</i>

351
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.072
<i>But then I learned
something I will never forget.</i>

352
00:16:17.334 --> 00:16:19.621
Oscar's dad's
a tongue-scrubber!

353
00:16:19.794 --> 00:16:27.291
Tongue-scrubber!
Tongue-scrubber!

354
00:16:27.969 --> 00:16:29.835
My dad was the greatest.

355
00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.047
But nobody loves a nobody.

356
00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.097
I wanna be a somebody.

357
00:16:37.312 --> 00:16:39.679
Oscar, you don't
have to live

358
00:16:39.773 --> 00:16:42.390
at the top of the reef
to be a somebody.

359
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.320
What's the difference?

360
00:16:46.404 --> 00:16:48.487
If I don't pay Mr. Sykes
back by tomorrow,

361
00:16:49.407 --> 00:16:51.023
I'm dead anyways.

362
00:16:54.037 --> 00:16:55.494
Wait here.

363
00:17:08.218 --> 00:17:09.299
Wha... What's this?

364
00:17:11.846 --> 00:17:13.553
A pink pearl?

365
00:17:13.723 --> 00:17:15.806
- Mmm-hmm.
- Where'd you get that?

366
00:17:16.268 --> 00:17:18.134
My grandmother gave it to me.

367
00:17:19.729 --> 00:17:23.063
She said it started
from a tiny grain of sand.

368
00:17:24.651 --> 00:17:26.267
But then, after a while,

369
00:17:27.028 --> 00:17:29.941
it grew into
something beautiful.

370
00:17:32.033 --> 00:17:33.899
Dreams can
begin small, too.

371
00:17:34.035 --> 00:17:35.071
No. Uh-uh.

372
00:17:35.161 --> 00:17:36.447
- No, I couldn't...
- Take it.

373
00:17:37.497 --> 00:17:40.365
It'll get you the money
you need for Mr. Sykes.

374
00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:47.066
What do you mean,
you don't understand?

375
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:48.170
What's there to understand?

376
00:17:48.216 --> 00:17:49.694
We've been over this
a thousand times.

377
00:17:49.718 --> 00:17:50.959
I don't want to say it again.

378
00:17:51.386 --> 00:17:53.343
You know, you're
really giving me agita.

379
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:54.841
I don't know how else
to say this.

380
00:17:54.931 --> 00:17:57.298
You see something, you kill it,
you eat it. Period.

381
00:17:57.726 --> 00:18:00.093
Thanks. That's what sharks do.

382
00:18:00.228 --> 00:18:02.595
That's a fine tradition.
What's the matter with you?

383
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:04.518
Your brother Frankie here,

384
00:18:04.649 --> 00:18:06.185
- he's a killer.
- Thanks, Pop.

385
00:18:06.276 --> 00:18:08.563
He's beautiful. He does
what he's supposed to do.

386
00:18:08.945 --> 00:18:09.981
Wipe your face.

387
00:18:10.822 --> 00:18:12.154
But you...

388
00:18:13.325 --> 00:18:14.532
I'm hearing things.

389
00:18:15.619 --> 00:18:17.155
You... You gotta understand,

390
00:18:17.245 --> 00:18:18.907
when you look weak,
it makes me look weak.

391
00:18:19.039 --> 00:18:20.575
- I know.
- I... I can't have that.

392
00:18:20.665 --> 00:18:21.951
Pop, I'm sorry.

393
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:23.866
Lenny, Lenny, look at me.

394
00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:25.169
Look at me.

395
00:18:25.462 --> 00:18:28.705
This handing over the business
is for you. For both of yous.

396
00:18:29.007 --> 00:18:31.215
You're acting like
you don't even want it.

397
00:18:32.469 --> 00:18:34.506
I need to know that you can
handle that.

398
00:18:39.267 --> 00:18:40.467
All right, all right.

399
00:18:40.852 --> 00:18:42.969
Right here, in front
of me now, eat this.

400
00:18:44.272 --> 00:18:46.980
Yeah. Oh, uh, gee.
Thanks, Pop.

401
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.687
Here's the thing.
I'm on a diet.

402
00:18:49.819 --> 00:18:51.902
I read an article
about shrimps.

403
00:18:51.988 --> 00:18:52.988
They're not good for you.

404
00:18:53.114 --> 00:18:56.357
You know how many calories
are in one of those shrimps?

405
00:18:57.118 --> 00:18:58.118
A lot.

406
00:18:58.244 --> 00:19:00.531
It's true, it's true,
and the other thing is,

407
00:19:01.164 --> 00:19:02.371
my sister had a baby,

408
00:19:02.457 --> 00:19:05.040
and I took it over
because she passed away,

409
00:19:05.126 --> 00:19:08.119
and then her baby lost
its legs and its arms,

410
00:19:08.213 --> 00:19:09.499
and now he's nothing
but a stump,

411
00:19:09.589 --> 00:19:11.751
but I still take care of him
with my wife,

412
00:19:11.883 --> 00:19:14.546
and it's growing,
and it's...

413
00:19:14.678 --> 00:19:17.386
It's fairly happy,
but it's difficult

414
00:19:17.472 --> 00:19:20.180
'cause I've been working
a second shift at the factory

415
00:19:20.266 --> 00:19:21.882
to put food on the table,

416
00:19:21.976 --> 00:19:23.968
but all the love that I see

417
00:19:24.062 --> 00:19:25.428
in that little guy's face

418
00:19:25.522 --> 00:19:27.309
makes it worth it in the end.

419
00:19:29.609 --> 00:19:30.850
True story.

420
00:19:35.156 --> 00:19:36.692
I'm not asking you anymore.

421
00:19:36.783 --> 00:19:38.240
I'm telling ya. Eat it.

422
00:19:38.618 --> 00:19:40.780
- No. Have mercy.
- Pop, please.

423
00:19:40.912 --> 00:19:42.119
- Eat.
- No eat!

424
00:19:42.247 --> 00:19:44.534
- What... No!
- Son, eat the shrimp!

425
00:19:44.666 --> 00:19:46.248
- Please!
- No! Please!

426
00:19:46.334 --> 00:19:47.916
- Eat. Eat. Eat!
- No!

427
00:19:48.002 --> 00:19:49.334
- Eat! Eat! Eat!
- No!

428
00:19:49.421 --> 00:19:51.253
Put the shrimp down!

429
00:19:54.551 --> 00:19:56.793
All right. Go now. No one's
looking. Get outta here.

430
00:19:56.886 --> 00:19:58.468
You're free. Go on. Go!

431
00:19:58.638 --> 00:20:00.971
Thank you.
You're a good person.

432
00:20:05.937 --> 00:20:07.053
Come on, fellas.

433
00:20:14.654 --> 00:20:16.316
Pop, Pop, I can
handle the reef.

434
00:20:16.406 --> 00:20:17.817
- It's not a problem.
- No. No.

435
00:20:18.116 --> 00:20:19.903
We're gonna do this
as a family.

436
00:20:20.076 --> 00:20:22.784
Frankie, take Lenny out,
show him the ropes.

437
00:20:22.871 --> 00:20:23.952
Oh, come on, Pop.

438
00:20:24.038 --> 00:20:25.825
Son, you're gonna learn
how to be a shark,

439
00:20:26.374 --> 00:20:27.990
whether you like it or not.

440
00:20:34.215 --> 00:20:35.956
That kid better show up,
or he's dead meat.

441
00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:37.336
Just say the word, boss.

442
00:20:38.011 --> 00:20:39.798
Carrying a big old envelope
full of money.

443
00:20:39.888 --> 00:20:41.720
Gonna give it to Mr. Sykes.

444
00:20:41.806 --> 00:20:44.264
Hurry up! This is our chance.
You don't wanna miss it.

445
00:20:44.392 --> 00:20:45.508
Are you sure
about this?

446
00:20:45.602 --> 00:20:47.059
A trainer friend
tipped me off.

447
00:20:47.395 --> 00:20:49.933
The race is rigged.
We can't lose.

448
00:20:50.064 --> 00:20:52.807
- What's the horse's name?
- Lucky Day.

449
00:20:52.901 --> 00:20:55.735
<i>The long shot,
Lucky Day, at 200 to 1.</i>

450
00:20:56.821 --> 00:20:58.733
We're gonna
be rich. Rich!

451
00:20:59.073 --> 00:21:02.066
Ooh. Top of the reef,
here I come!

452
00:21:02.577 --> 00:21:03.818
No! Wait. What am I doing?

453
00:21:03.912 --> 00:21:06.370
Remember what Angie said.
Remember what Angie said.

454
00:21:07.916 --> 00:21:09.123
What did Angie say?

455
00:21:09.334 --> 00:21:11.121
Dreams can begin small.

456
00:21:11.252 --> 00:21:13.915
You just have to bet it all.

457
00:21:14.005 --> 00:21:15.166
Bet it all!

458
00:21:15.256 --> 00:21:17.839
<i>And Lucky Day wins!</i>

459
00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:20.511
<i>Yeah</i>

460
00:21:20.595 --> 00:21:21.631
<i>It's Oscar</i>

461
00:21:24.307 --> 00:21:25.798
Five thousand on
Lucky Day to win!

462
00:21:26.976 --> 00:21:28.183
That's 200 to 1.

463
00:21:28.394 --> 00:21:30.056
That would pay
a million clams!

464
00:21:30.313 --> 00:21:33.977
Well, I guess that makes me
Oscar the Millionaire.

465
00:21:34.067 --> 00:21:35.558
<i>The Millionaire.</i>

466
00:21:38.112 --> 00:21:40.820
Lucky Day. Lucky Day.
Lucky Day!

467
00:21:44.828 --> 00:21:47.161
<i>She's dangerous, super-bad</i>

468
00:21:47.747 --> 00:21:49.739
<i>Better watch out
She'll take your cash</i>

469
00:21:49.833 --> 00:21:54.202
<i>She's a gold digger</i>

470
00:21:54.337 --> 00:21:56.670
<i>She's dangerous, super-bad</i>

471
00:21:57.298 --> 00:21:59.415
<i>Better watch out
She'll take your cash</i>

472
00:21:59.509 --> 00:22:00.625
<i>She's a gold digger</i>

473
00:22:00.927 --> 00:22:02.293
Nice bet.

474
00:22:08.977 --> 00:22:10.138
You got a name?

475
00:22:11.938 --> 00:22:13.429
You wanna tell me what it is?

476
00:22:14.774 --> 00:22:16.606
Well, mine's Lola.

477
00:22:17.944 --> 00:22:20.106
Come on, man.
Get your game face on.

478
00:22:22.574 --> 00:22:24.156
So...

479
00:22:24.826 --> 00:22:26.738
Lola. My name's...

480
00:22:27.954 --> 00:22:30.617
Uh, my name is Oscar, sweetie.

481
00:22:30.707 --> 00:22:32.448
Mrs. Sanchez.

482
00:22:32.542 --> 00:22:35.376
That hippity-hop smooth talk
don't work with me.

483
00:22:35.461 --> 00:22:36.461
Oh. My bad.

484
00:22:36.546 --> 00:22:37.787
Hey. So, uh...

485
00:22:37.881 --> 00:22:40.669
Oscar. I was starting
to think you skipped out on me.

486
00:22:40.758 --> 00:22:43.375
Sykes! Hey! Oh, I see you, uh,

487
00:22:43.469 --> 00:22:45.586
are already on your way
to the concession stand.

488
00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.440
- What are you doing?
- Bring us some drinks.

489
00:22:47.515 --> 00:22:49.535
- Why are you touching me?
- That would be great. Thanks.

490
00:22:49.559 --> 00:22:51.799
Oh, and, uh, bring back, uh,
some little wiener thingies.

491
00:22:51.853 --> 00:22:53.289
You mean the one
with the toothpicks?

492
00:22:53.313 --> 00:22:54.873
What are you doing?
Don't listen to him.

493
00:22:54.939 --> 00:22:57.522
Lola, let me escort you
to my box.

494
00:22:57.609 --> 00:22:59.350
- Your box?
- His box?

495
00:22:59.444 --> 00:23:01.436
You can't afford
the gum under the seats.

496
00:23:01.571 --> 00:23:03.608
- Sykes.
- He just laid five grand on Lucky Day.

497
00:23:03.698 --> 00:23:05.985
I think he can afford
anything he wants.

498
00:23:08.161 --> 00:23:10.073
Five grand? My five grand?

499
00:23:10.204 --> 00:23:12.036
Uh-uh. No. It was
another five grand.

500
00:23:12.123 --> 00:23:14.365
You had the money to pay me,
and you bet it?

501
00:23:14.459 --> 00:23:16.291
- Hold up. Sykes!
- Give me that!

502
00:23:16.419 --> 00:23:17.660
Clearly, I've made a mistake.

503
00:23:17.795 --> 00:23:19.377
No. No. Wait. Lola!

504
00:23:19.464 --> 00:23:21.171
Look. Deep down,

505
00:23:21.257 --> 00:23:22.338
I'm really superficial.

506
00:23:22.508 --> 00:23:25.046
And don't get me wrong,
you're cute,

507
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:27.427
but you're a nobody.

508
00:23:29.098 --> 00:23:32.717
Oscar, you cute,
but you're a nobody.

509
00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:34.392
Wait! Lola!
Come back!

510
00:23:34.479 --> 00:23:36.186
I'm not a nobody.

511
00:23:36.272 --> 00:23:37.979
I'm a wiener!

512
00:23:39.901 --> 00:23:40.937
You are unbelievable.

513
00:23:41.027 --> 00:23:42.393
You're in trouble
up to your gills,

514
00:23:42.487 --> 00:23:44.194
and still you're asking
for more? Huh?

515
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.840
Go on. Get in here.

516
00:23:46.199 --> 00:23:48.907
Oscar, you better pray that
this horse of yours comes through.

517
00:23:48.993 --> 00:23:50.450
Betting my 5,000.

518
00:23:50.954 --> 00:23:53.196
Hey! Hey! Outta my seat.
You, outta my seat.

519
00:23:53.414 --> 00:23:54.950
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

520
00:23:55.083 --> 00:23:56.949
Sit tight and
watch the race.

521
00:23:57.085 --> 00:23:58.451
With your good eye.

522
00:23:59.754 --> 00:24:00.961
Good eye.

523
00:24:01.047 --> 00:24:02.316
<i>The horses are at the post.</i>

524
00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.002
<i>And they're off!</i>

525
00:24:04.092 --> 00:24:06.675
<i>It's Fish Fingers followed
by Sea Biscuit and Salmonella.</i>

526
00:24:06.761 --> 00:24:09.674
<i>The long shot, Lucky Day, is having
trouble getting out of the gate.</i>

527
00:24:09.806 --> 00:24:12.389
<i>- What?
- Only a sucker could've bet on that horse.</i>

528
00:24:12.517 --> 00:24:15.100
Don't sweat it, man.
He does this all the time.

529
00:24:15.228 --> 00:24:18.596
<i>What's this?
Lucky Day's crashing his way through,</i>

530
00:24:18.731 --> 00:24:20.417
<i>and he's off and running.</i>

531
00:24:20.441 --> 00:24:22.558
<i>Down the straightaway,
it's Sea Biscuit,</i>

532
00:24:22.694 --> 00:24:23.734
<i>Fish Fingers
and Lucky Day.</i>

533
00:24:23.778 --> 00:24:25.565
Please, Lucky Day, go fast.

534
00:24:26.239 --> 00:24:28.926
<i>Coming round
the far turn, it's Sea Biscuit by a length,</i>

535
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:30.691
<i>and Lucky Day well
behind the pack.</i>

536
00:24:30.827 --> 00:24:34.036
<i>And here comes Lucky Day
coming up from behind!</i>

537
00:24:34.163 --> 00:24:36.450
<i>He's passing
Yellowtail, Salmonella,</i>

538
00:24:36.582 --> 00:24:38.665
<i>- coming up on Fish Fingers!
- Who's your fish?</i>

539
00:24:38.793 --> 00:24:41.376
<i>Around
the final turn, here comes Lucky Day.</i>

540
00:24:41.546 --> 00:24:43.287
<i>Lucky Day's caught up
to Fish Fingers!</i>

541
00:24:43.381 --> 00:24:44.381
<i>They're head-to-head.</i>

542
00:24:44.507 --> 00:24:46.944
<i>- Lucky Day's pulling ahead!
- Come on through for me, baby!</i>

543
00:24:46.968 --> 00:24:50.006
I'm getting tired just thinking
about counting all this money.

544
00:24:50.096 --> 00:24:51.883
<i>Look at Lucky Day go!</i>

545
00:24:51.973 --> 00:24:55.466
<i>We're moving on up
To the east side</i>

546
00:24:55.601 --> 00:24:57.467
<i>Absolutely amazing!</i>

547
00:24:57.562 --> 00:25:00.680
<i>This looks to be Lucky
Day's big day.</i>

548
00:25:00.815 --> 00:25:02.556
<i>It's Lucky Day!</i>

549
00:25:06.279 --> 00:25:08.066
<i>Oh! What happened?</i>

550
00:25:08.197 --> 00:25:09.984
<i>Lucky Day is down.</i>

551
00:25:11.701 --> 00:25:13.192
<i>We're moving on up</i>

552
00:25:13.286 --> 00:25:14.286
<i>To the east side</i>

553
00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:15.861
No!

554
00:25:19.042 --> 00:25:21.830
<i>And here comes
Fish Fingers followed by Sea Biscuit,</i>

555
00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:23.410
<i>Yellowtail and
Fish Fingers wins.</i>

556
00:25:23.504 --> 00:25:24.504
What happened?
Let me see.

557
00:25:24.589 --> 00:25:26.330
Wait! I just wanna
hold you.

558
00:25:26.424 --> 00:25:27.960
Oscar, get outta my way.

559
00:25:28.092 --> 00:25:30.946
<i>- What a sad day for Lucky Day.
- Remember your happy place.</i>

560
00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:33.929
<i>And that's why they
call him the long shot.</i>

561
00:25:34.057 --> 00:25:36.140
Yo, that was crazy!
Right? Who knew?

562
00:25:36.225 --> 00:25:37.682
Everything's set,
it's a lock,

563
00:25:37.769 --> 00:25:39.476
we good to go,
we in the money,

564
00:25:39.645 --> 00:25:41.978
and he trips underwater.

565
00:25:42.398 --> 00:25:45.766
Who in the halibut
trips under water?

566
00:25:45.902 --> 00:25:47.734
And by the way,
on what?

567
00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.482
That's it! That's it!
I've had it.

568
00:25:49.572 --> 00:25:50.632
Ernie, Bernie,

569
00:25:50.656 --> 00:25:52.760
I want you to find the deepest,
darkest hole in the ocean

570
00:25:52.784 --> 00:25:55.948
and when you do,
dig deeper and put him in it!

571
00:26:01.334 --> 00:26:03.451
Sorry, kid.
It's nothing personal.

572
00:26:03.544 --> 00:26:04.705
It's just business.

573
00:26:10.384 --> 00:26:12.125
<i>Don't worry</i>

574
00:26:13.387 --> 00:26:15.128
<i>About a thing</i>

575
00:26:17.058 --> 00:26:19.050
<i>'Cause every little thing</i>

576
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:20.972
<i>Is gonna be all right</i>

577
00:26:21.312 --> 00:26:23.144
- This is how you sing it, Oscar.
- Yeah.

578
00:26:23.981 --> 00:26:25.643
Sykes, he like ya, mon.

579
00:26:25.775 --> 00:26:28.142
- Him say take it easy on you.
- Ooh!

580
00:26:28.236 --> 00:26:30.979
But Sykes is not here.

581
00:26:31.197 --> 00:26:32.358
True.

582
00:26:33.616 --> 00:26:34.982
Ernie, let me
ask you a question.

583
00:26:35.159 --> 00:26:36.637
Yeah, mon. Go on.

584
00:26:36.661 --> 00:26:39.369
Why is it that me locks
can sting other people,

585
00:26:39.455 --> 00:26:41.538
but they have no effect
on me or you?

586
00:26:42.834 --> 00:26:44.541
Ernie! I didn't
mean it, Ernie.

587
00:26:44.627 --> 00:26:45.788
I didn't mean it, man.

588
00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.286
Ernie!

589
00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:48.962
Oh, Ernie!

590
00:26:49.048 --> 00:26:51.335
Ernie! You made a joke!

591
00:26:51.843 --> 00:26:53.755
Good one, mon. Respect.

592
00:26:53.845 --> 00:26:56.007
Respect. Bloodfire.

593
00:26:58.391 --> 00:27:00.474
Frankie, you know
I can't do this.

594
00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.246
Lenny, if you
wanna make Pop happy,

595
00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:03.636
you gotta kill something.

596
00:27:03.729 --> 00:27:06.346
Or I could find
a very old sick fish and just wait.

597
00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.057
Ugh. It's getting around,
your thing at the restaurant.

598
00:27:09.152 --> 00:27:11.485
You know how fish talk.
Bit-a-bit, bit-a-bop.

599
00:27:11.571 --> 00:27:13.340
This, that, the other.
Then how ya doing, boom!

600
00:27:13.364 --> 00:27:14.964
Forget about it. You're dead.

601
00:27:14.991 --> 00:27:16.198
Okay. Seriously,

602
00:27:16.284 --> 00:27:17.775
I can't understand wiseguy,

603
00:27:17.869 --> 00:27:19.531
so you'll have to
be more specific.

604
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.236
Oh, specific.
You want specific.

605
00:27:21.372 --> 00:27:23.204
Be a shark for once in your life!

606
00:27:23.708 --> 00:27:24.708
What am I gonna do?

607
00:27:24.792 --> 00:27:27.455
Aw. Lenny, forget
about it. Okay?

608
00:27:27.545 --> 00:27:29.787
We do couple of practice runs,
badda-bing, badda-boom,

609
00:27:29.881 --> 00:27:32.999
<i>Pop's happy, you're a shark,
life goes on. Capisce?</i>

610
00:27:33.217 --> 00:27:35.129
<i>Okay. Okay. Capisce.</i>

611
00:27:35.219 --> 00:27:37.176
Wait, wait, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Bingo.

612
00:27:38.681 --> 00:27:40.422
Right there. Dead ahead.
You see it?

613
00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:43.308
TV dinner. Don't get
no easier than this.

614
00:27:43.728 --> 00:27:46.721
All right. Come on.
Eye of the tiger.

615
00:27:47.398 --> 00:27:49.390
Frankie, I can do this!

616
00:27:49.483 --> 00:27:50.769
What if I can't do this?

617
00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.351
Then don't bother
coming home.

618
00:27:52.445 --> 00:27:54.402
Good point! All right.

619
00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.316
Hit him in the tail again.

620
00:27:57.408 --> 00:28:00.025
- I like the funny face he make.
- Funny face.

621
00:28:00.119 --> 00:28:01.985
- Ernie!
- Blow out!

622
00:28:08.085 --> 00:28:10.293
Ah! Uh, guys?

623
00:28:10.379 --> 00:28:12.041
Guys, don't leave me alone.

624
00:28:12.131 --> 00:28:14.623
There could be
sharks out here.

625
00:28:22.934 --> 00:28:25.597
Oh, no. Wait. I'm sorry.
No, no. I'm not...

626
00:28:25.686 --> 00:28:26.722
- Lenny.
- What?

627
00:28:26.812 --> 00:28:28.144
Like this.

628
00:28:28.397 --> 00:28:30.309
Oh, no. Ah.

629
00:28:31.067 --> 00:28:32.524
Aah.

630
00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:34.351
Oh, just get it
over with!

631
00:28:34.445 --> 00:28:36.232
Wait a minute.
Do me a favor.

632
00:28:36.322 --> 00:28:37.322
Don't chew me.

633
00:28:37.406 --> 00:28:38.508
I'm not for that.

634
00:28:38.532 --> 00:28:39.613
I'm not gonna eat ya.

635
00:28:39.742 --> 00:28:41.984
Don't do the whole
head-trip thing with me.

636
00:28:42.119 --> 00:28:44.202
Listen to me. Don't move
until I tell you.

637
00:28:45.081 --> 00:28:46.322
Back up!

638
00:28:47.166 --> 00:28:49.408
That's it, Len.
There you go, buddy.

639
00:28:50.002 --> 00:28:52.119
Wave those fins,
baby. Dig in.

640
00:28:53.756 --> 00:28:55.622
I'm just pretending
so you can get away.

641
00:28:55.758 --> 00:28:57.624
- Huh?
- When I turn around, you take off!

642
00:28:58.511 --> 00:28:59.797
Tastes just like chicken.

643
00:29:00.388 --> 00:29:02.345
Mm. Mmm!

644
00:29:02.431 --> 00:29:03.638
Oh, no.

645
00:29:04.558 --> 00:29:05.924
- Oh! What did I tell you?
- Oh!

646
00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.019
- I'm sorry. You want me to go now?
- Just go!

647
00:29:09.146 --> 00:29:10.887
That's it. I've had it
up to here.

648
00:29:13.067 --> 00:29:14.067
Ooh!

649
00:29:14.151 --> 00:29:15.151
Oh, no!

650
00:29:15.236 --> 00:29:17.478
Hurry! Swim!
No, Frankie. Wait!

651
00:29:17.571 --> 00:29:19.528
Oh!
Get your boy! Get your boy!

652
00:29:35.089 --> 00:29:36.921
Frankie!

653
00:29:41.971 --> 00:29:43.337
Lenny...

654
00:29:44.932 --> 00:29:47.174
Lenny, is that you?

655
00:29:47.435 --> 00:29:48.767
I'm here, Frankie.

656
00:29:49.312 --> 00:29:51.144
- Come closer.
- Yes? What is it?

657
00:29:51.272 --> 00:29:52.888
I'm so cold.

658
00:29:53.024 --> 00:29:55.186
That's just because
we're cold-blooded.

659
00:29:55.693 --> 00:29:56.693
Ow!

660
00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.606
Moron.

661
00:30:00.114 --> 00:30:01.901
Frankie, no.

662
00:30:03.242 --> 00:30:05.279
No!

663
00:30:07.872 --> 00:30:10.034
This is all my fault.

664
00:30:10.333 --> 00:30:12.950
I'm so sorry, Frankie.

665
00:30:13.878 --> 00:30:16.370
How am I ever gonna
explain this to Pop?

666
00:30:18.132 --> 00:30:19.464
Oh, no!

667
00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.632
Watch it! Back up!

668
00:30:28.768 --> 00:30:31.055
I'm crazy! I be tripping!

669
00:30:31.187 --> 00:30:32.519
- Whoa.
- Oh.

670
00:30:36.233 --> 00:30:37.690
Ow! What the...

671
00:30:42.656 --> 00:30:44.192
Don't hurt us. We're sorry.

672
00:30:44.283 --> 00:30:46.400
It was all Ernie's idea.

673
00:30:49.747 --> 00:30:50.863
Oscar...

674
00:30:50.956 --> 00:30:52.288
Did you kill that shark?

675
00:30:57.588 --> 00:30:58.669
Uh...

676
00:30:58.756 --> 00:31:00.213
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

677
00:31:00.299 --> 00:31:02.541
Exac... Exactly how it look,
that's how it is.

678
00:31:02.635 --> 00:31:04.001
What happened?

679
00:31:04.095 --> 00:31:06.382
Oh, you... You wanna
know what happened?

680
00:31:06.514 --> 00:31:08.972
- Yeah. You're standing on top of a shark.
- Yeah.

681
00:31:09.058 --> 00:31:10.058
Go on, mon.

682
00:31:10.142 --> 00:31:11.262
I'll tell you what happened!

683
00:31:13.062 --> 00:31:16.430
Big ol' shark,
about 75, 100 feet long.

684
00:31:16.524 --> 00:31:18.015
He's swimming at me. Right?

685
00:31:19.276 --> 00:31:20.483
With teeth like razors!

686
00:31:20.569 --> 00:31:21.935
Ooh! Razors! Ha!

687
00:31:22.405 --> 00:31:24.488
And I was all like, "You gonna
come at me like that?"

688
00:31:24.573 --> 00:31:26.530
You're gonna come
at the "O" like that?

689
00:31:26.617 --> 00:31:27.698
Uh-uh.

690
00:31:27.785 --> 00:31:29.947
Hey! Do the muscle thing.
The muscle thing.

691
00:31:30.079 --> 00:31:32.116
Oh. Right, right.
I told that dude,

692
00:31:32.206 --> 00:31:34.414
"You see this guy?"
And I pointed like this.

693
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.868
"Well, he's got a brother,
and he lives right over here,

694
00:31:37.962 --> 00:31:40.329
"and I think it's time
for a little...

695
00:31:40.423 --> 00:31:42.415
- "family reunion!"
- Family reunion!

696
00:31:45.302 --> 00:31:46.964
- See, man? I told you.
- Excuse me.

697
00:31:47.054 --> 00:31:48.886
- We were right there!
- Pardon me.

698
00:31:49.348 --> 00:31:51.135
- Move it!
- Whoa. Sorry. Sorry.

699
00:31:51.559 --> 00:31:53.266
She seems
so nice on TV.

700
00:31:53.519 --> 00:31:54.680
Oscar, Katie Current.

701
00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:57.934
As the first fish in history to ever
take on a shark and win, tell me,

702
00:31:58.065 --> 00:31:59.835
does this mean you're now
protector of the reef,

703
00:31:59.859 --> 00:32:01.441
new sheriff in town,
the big kahuna?

704
00:32:01.735 --> 00:32:03.772
Katie, I'm gonna
keep it real.

705
00:32:03.904 --> 00:32:05.736
- I can call you Katie?
- Of course.

706
00:32:05.865 --> 00:32:10.280
<i>Any shark try to mess around
in Oscartown is going down!</i>

707
00:32:14.331 --> 00:32:16.789
<i>Yeah, it's poetic.
In the heat I get poetic!</i>

708
00:32:16.876 --> 00:32:18.037
Oscar.

709
00:32:18.419 --> 00:32:20.752
Mmm. Oscar.

710
00:32:22.673 --> 00:32:24.234
Okay. Get outta here,
you barracudas.

711
00:32:24.258 --> 00:32:26.375
Any further questions
will be fielded by me.

712
00:32:26.594 --> 00:32:27.960
- And you are?
- His manager.

713
00:32:28.095 --> 00:32:29.677
- Uh...
- Sykes, with a "Y."

714
00:32:29.805 --> 00:32:31.797
And I'm
his financial adviser!

715
00:32:34.852 --> 00:32:36.138
You wanna see my puppets?

716
00:32:38.272 --> 00:32:39.472
Hello!

717
00:32:40.691 --> 00:32:43.434
Could you excuse us for a moment,
please?

718
00:32:43.611 --> 00:32:45.227
- My manager?
- You're a superstar.

719
00:32:45.321 --> 00:32:47.233
We're gonna make a fortune.
Let me handle it.

720
00:32:47.406 --> 00:32:49.301
- What about the five G's?
- Forget the five G's.

721
00:32:49.325 --> 00:32:50.657
From now on,
we're partners.

722
00:32:50.784 --> 00:32:52.366
What exactly
are we talking about?

723
00:32:52.495 --> 00:32:54.077
I'm thinking 90-10 split.

724
00:32:54.205 --> 00:32:55.205
That's pretty generous.

725
00:32:55.289 --> 00:32:56.766
You're the 10. I take
my 90 off the top.

726
00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:58.070
- I don't think so.
- Talk to me.

727
00:32:58.125 --> 00:32:59.241
- You get 15.
- 70.

728
00:32:59.335 --> 00:33:00.335
- 20.
- 75.

729
00:33:00.419 --> 00:33:02.001
Dude! You're going
the wrong way.

730
00:33:02.463 --> 00:33:03.463
50-50.

731
00:33:03.589 --> 00:33:04.921
- You happy?
- No. You happy?

732
00:33:05.007 --> 00:33:06.248
- No!
- Deal!

733
00:33:09.637 --> 00:33:11.094
Uh, my manager and I

734
00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:12.740
are now prepared
to take your questions.

735
00:33:13.349 --> 00:33:16.308
Oscar, are you going to continue
working here at the wash?

736
00:33:16.435 --> 00:33:18.051
Please. I barely
work here now.

737
00:33:19.438 --> 00:33:20.974
Keep it up, kid.
You're slaying 'em.

738
00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:22.931
No! He's slaying sharks!

739
00:33:23.067 --> 00:33:25.275
Hey. Hey, that's good.
That's good. I like that.

740
00:33:25.361 --> 00:33:27.148
- Oscar the Sharkslayer.
- All right.

741
00:33:27.279 --> 00:33:28.279
Whoa!

742
00:33:28.364 --> 00:33:29.650
A sharkslayer!

743
00:33:29.782 --> 00:33:31.273
<i>You heard it
here first.</i>

744
00:33:31.408 --> 00:33:33.845
<i>From now on, any shark tries
to bother this reef,</i>

745
00:33:33.869 --> 00:33:35.861
<i>it's his funeral.</i>

746
00:33:48.384 --> 00:33:53.800
<i>I could fly higher
Than an eagle</i>

747
00:33:55.558 --> 00:34:00.724
<i>If you are the wind
Beneath my wings</i>

748
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:04.352
Frankie, we'll miss you.

749
00:34:04.817 --> 00:34:06.228
To Frankie.

750
00:34:07.903 --> 00:34:09.815
It's a terrible thing,
Don Lino.

751
00:34:09.947 --> 00:34:11.688
Everybody loved Frankie.

752
00:34:12.241 --> 00:34:15.484
May whoever did this
die a thousand deaths.

753
00:34:15.744 --> 00:34:18.407
May his stinking,
maggot-covered corpse

754
00:34:18.497 --> 00:34:20.329
rot in the fiery depths
of hell.

755
00:34:22.418 --> 00:34:24.660
Thank you for your
kind thoughts, Giuseppe.

756
00:34:26.046 --> 00:34:28.959
Oh, and may Lenny be found
safe and sound, too.

757
00:34:29.133 --> 00:34:30.669
Hope he's okay.

758
00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:32.751
Oh, Lenny.

759
00:34:34.054 --> 00:34:35.511
Don't worry, boss.

760
00:34:35.848 --> 00:34:37.464
I said some things to him.

761
00:34:37.933 --> 00:34:39.424
We gotta find him.

762
00:34:39.768 --> 00:34:41.179
We're searching everywhere.

763
00:34:41.562 --> 00:34:43.144
Forget about it.
He'll turn up.

764
00:34:43.647 --> 00:34:44.979
What's wrong with that kid?

765
00:34:45.107 --> 00:34:46.769
Why's he gotta be
so different?

766
00:34:47.234 --> 00:34:50.568
Frankie, God rest his soul,
he was perfect.

767
00:34:50.696 --> 00:34:51.857
Perfect!

768
00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.323
Oh, Luca.

769
00:34:56.243 --> 00:34:57.529
Who could've done this?

770
00:34:57.786 --> 00:35:00.199
Don Lino,

771
00:35:00.331 --> 00:35:04.951
at this most difficult time,
please accept my deepest condolences.

772
00:35:05.419 --> 00:35:06.785
Thank you, Don Feinberg,

773
00:35:06.879 --> 00:35:08.745
for honoring my son
with your song.

774
00:35:09.548 --> 00:35:11.414
I got some news,

775
00:35:11.592 --> 00:35:14.050
about the guy
who took out Frankie.

776
00:35:20.225 --> 00:35:22.717
Let's, uh... Yeah,
let's talk over here.

777
00:35:25.564 --> 00:35:28.022
He come out of nowhere,
this guy.

778
00:35:28.317 --> 00:35:29.728
Calls himself,

779
00:35:30.027 --> 00:35:32.269
"The Sharkslayer."

780
00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:35.147
Ira, over here.

781
00:35:35.282 --> 00:35:36.318
Sorry.

782
00:35:36.408 --> 00:35:38.616
The Sharkslayer!

783
00:35:38.702 --> 00:35:39.738
Where do I find him?

784
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:41.862
He's from the Southside Reef.

785
00:35:41.955 --> 00:35:43.491
That's all we could dig up.

786
00:35:43.999 --> 00:35:45.865
Thank you. Thank you.

787
00:35:48.087 --> 00:35:49.749
- Any requests?
- Luca.

788
00:35:49.838 --> 00:35:51.625
<i>How about that
Titanic song?</i>

789
00:35:51.715 --> 00:35:52.875
Oh, no! Not again!

790
00:35:52.966 --> 00:35:55.959
Get Sykes. He knows that reef
better than anybody.

791
00:35:56.178 --> 00:35:58.636
I wanna find this guy. I wanna
know everything about him.

792
00:35:58.764 --> 00:36:00.801
I wanna know where he lives,
where he sleeps.

793
00:36:00.891 --> 00:36:02.883
He pops a gill, I wanna know
about it.

794
00:36:03.018 --> 00:36:04.600
Who is this Sharkslayer?

795
00:36:04.687 --> 00:36:05.803
<i>Here he is,</i>

796
00:36:05.938 --> 00:36:07.895
<i>the Sharkslayer!</i>

797
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.817
<i>I think I love you, baby</i>

798
00:36:16.907 --> 00:36:19.024
<i>What you feel now</i>

799
00:36:19.326 --> 00:36:21.067
<i>I think need you, baby</i>

800
00:36:21.161 --> 00:36:22.948
<i>What you know now</i>

801
00:36:23.038 --> 00:36:24.745
<i>Uh-uh, uh-huh</i>

802
00:36:24.832 --> 00:36:26.289
<i>To be real</i>

803
00:36:26.375 --> 00:36:29.163
<i>Uh-huh, mmm-hmm, whoo</i>

804
00:36:32.798 --> 00:36:36.633
<i>Your love's for real now</i>

805
00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.503
<i>You know that your love</i>

806
00:36:39.596 --> 00:36:41.258
<i>And my love</i>

807
00:36:41.724 --> 00:36:43.966
<i>My love is here to stay</i>

808
00:36:44.059 --> 00:36:45.891
Let's get this party
started right!

809
00:36:46.395 --> 00:36:48.933
<i>What you find now</i>

810
00:36:50.149 --> 00:36:52.892
<i>What you feel now</i>

811
00:36:53.318 --> 00:36:55.651
- Here he is, the Big O!
- Psych!

812
00:36:55.738 --> 00:36:57.650
Pound that, dog!
Pound it!

813
00:36:58.073 --> 00:37:01.157
Oscar, raise the reef!
Raise the reef, buddy!

814
00:37:01.243 --> 00:37:02.905
- Uh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

815
00:37:02.995 --> 00:37:04.702
Huh? Hot!

816
00:37:04.788 --> 00:37:06.575
Yeah, that's pretty...
That's pretty...

817
00:37:06.665 --> 00:37:08.952
Come on, cabbage patch!
Cabbage patch.

818
00:37:09.084 --> 00:37:10.871
Angie, you made it!

819
00:37:10.961 --> 00:37:13.044
Wait, wait! You're
gonna break my gift!

820
00:37:13.172 --> 00:37:15.255
Oh, come on. You didn't
have to get me anything.

821
00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.456
What'd you get me?

822
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:19.884
Well, what does every
bachelor pad need, huh?

823
00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:21.256
A lava lamp!

824
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:23.387
How did you know I love lava lamps?

825
00:37:23.891 --> 00:37:26.133
I'm gonna put it right here
next to my other one.

826
00:37:31.315 --> 00:37:32.647
Hey, come on, Ang!

827
00:37:32.733 --> 00:37:35.441
I wanna show you
the best thing about this place.

828
00:37:38.238 --> 00:37:39.274
Wow!

829
00:37:39.364 --> 00:37:40.605
How great is this view?

830
00:37:40.741 --> 00:37:42.528
Top of
the reef. It's...

831
00:37:43.327 --> 00:37:44.327
It's amazing.

832
00:37:44.578 --> 00:37:46.035
I know. It's
beautiful, right?

833
00:37:46.121 --> 00:37:47.202
Like you.

834
00:37:47.289 --> 00:37:49.076
Like your
new apartment.

835
00:37:49.291 --> 00:37:51.908
It's... Wow! Awesome!

836
00:37:54.463 --> 00:37:59.174
What I'm trying to say is
that I'm proud of you, Oscar.

837
00:37:59.301 --> 00:38:01.463
Yeah. It was...
It was nothing,

838
00:38:01.553 --> 00:38:03.169
really. You know?

839
00:38:03.639 --> 00:38:04.720
Hey! Oh! You know what?

840
00:38:04.807 --> 00:38:06.639
Wait right here. Don't move.

841
00:38:06.725 --> 00:38:07.725
I'll be right back.

842
00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:09.517
Girl, you are gonna flip!

843
00:38:13.398 --> 00:38:14.793
- Boop! I'm back.
- Oh, you're back!

844
00:38:15.984 --> 00:38:17.395
You know what, Ang?

845
00:38:17.653 --> 00:38:19.019
Where I am right now,

846
00:38:19.112 --> 00:38:21.229
this whole new life I've got

847
00:38:21.323 --> 00:38:23.906
and all my dreams
coming true,

848
00:38:24.743 --> 00:38:27.952
in a weird kinda way,

849
00:38:28.747 --> 00:38:31.239
well, I never could've
done it without you.

850
00:38:31.834 --> 00:38:33.826
Oh, sure, you could.

851
00:38:34.503 --> 00:38:36.745
Well, probably not.

852
00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:40.457
Ang. Here.

853
00:38:40.551 --> 00:38:42.793
Oh, Oscar!

854
00:38:43.595 --> 00:38:44.836
I know, I know.

855
00:38:44.972 --> 00:38:47.715
I'm just sorry that
it took so long.

856
00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:49.216
Oh, that's okay.

857
00:38:49.685 --> 00:38:50.926
Bam!

858
00:38:51.061 --> 00:38:52.097
Huh?

859
00:38:52.187 --> 00:38:53.678
My grandmother's pearl.

860
00:38:55.524 --> 00:38:56.524
With interest!

861
00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:58.562
Now, I don't
forget anything,

862
00:38:58.652 --> 00:39:00.484
and I never forget
who my friends are.

863
00:39:00.654 --> 00:39:02.737
Oh.

864
00:39:09.913 --> 00:39:11.279
Ang, uh...

865
00:39:11.999 --> 00:39:13.740
Oh, hi.

866
00:39:13.834 --> 00:39:15.666
I'm not interrupting
something, am I?

867
00:39:16.712 --> 00:39:17.981
- Yes, we're talking.
- No! Uh-uh.

868
00:39:18.005 --> 00:39:20.463
Hey, Lola. Wow! You're here!

869
00:39:20.757 --> 00:39:22.589
Oh!

870
00:39:22.718 --> 00:39:23.718
Uh, hey, you...

871
00:39:23.802 --> 00:39:25.442
You gotta come best
my meet friend, Angie.

872
00:39:25.721 --> 00:39:28.839
Eat my
best men, Wangie.

873
00:39:28.932 --> 00:39:31.470
Best friend?
Oh, that's sweet.

874
00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:34.769
So you won't mind if I steal him
for a while then, will you?

875
00:39:43.196 --> 00:39:46.610
So, look who's
a somebody after all.

876
00:39:46.742 --> 00:39:48.483
Well, you know, uh...

877
00:39:48.577 --> 00:39:51.615
Sharks! On the...
On the edge of the reef!

878
00:39:51.788 --> 00:39:53.871
They're... They're
Great Whites!

879
00:39:53.957 --> 00:39:55.493
Sharks!

880
00:39:55.626 --> 00:39:57.346
Okay, everybody,
go home to your loved ones!

881
00:39:57.377 --> 00:40:00.415
Spend the last few hours
that you have with each other.

882
00:40:04.468 --> 00:40:05.468
Oh!

883
00:40:06.845 --> 00:40:08.552
I mean...

884
00:40:08.639 --> 00:40:11.006
That's the way it used to be
around here.

885
00:40:11.141 --> 00:40:13.633
We'd have been all scrambling
for cover and stuff,

886
00:40:13.727 --> 00:40:15.889
but not since Oscar
came to town!

887
00:40:17.105 --> 00:40:18.767
So, Lola, uh, baby,

888
00:40:18.857 --> 00:40:20.293
just wait here.
I'm gonna be right back.

889
00:40:20.317 --> 00:40:22.479
I'm gonna go ahead,
take care of these sharks.

890
00:40:22.569 --> 00:40:23.605
Go get 'em, tiger!

891
00:40:23.695 --> 00:40:26.529
Whoo! Biceps, triceps!

892
00:40:26.615 --> 00:40:28.652
Grr!

893
00:40:28.742 --> 00:40:29.886
All right, Oscar!
You're the best!

894
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:30.991
Go get 'em, Oscar!

895
00:40:31.119 --> 00:40:32.119
Grr!

896
00:40:41.338 --> 00:40:42.795
Lenny!

897
00:40:44.091 --> 00:40:46.083
Where the heck is he? Lenny!

898
00:40:46.176 --> 00:40:47.462
Hey, what are you doing?

899
00:40:47.552 --> 00:40:49.259
There's a sharkslayer
out here.

900
00:40:49.346 --> 00:40:51.554
- You wanna be next?
- Oh, yeah.

901
00:40:52.015 --> 00:40:54.473
Lenny! Lenny!

902
00:40:55.477 --> 00:40:56.477
Ooh.

903
00:40:57.145 --> 00:40:58.352
That was close.

904
00:40:58.730 --> 00:40:59.891
Super close.

905
00:41:03.527 --> 00:41:04.643
Don't panic.

906
00:41:07.656 --> 00:41:09.192
Quiet! We're safe.

907
00:41:09.324 --> 00:41:12.237
- Oh, no, not you again!
- Yeah.

908
00:41:12.327 --> 00:41:13.568
What was that?

909
00:41:13.662 --> 00:41:15.244
Yo! What is with you, man?

910
00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:17.367
Shh! He could be anywhere.

911
00:41:17.499 --> 00:41:19.115
- Who?
- Shh!

912
00:41:20.043 --> 00:41:21.784
The Sharkslayer.

913
00:41:23.338 --> 00:41:24.954
There's no sharkslayer
out here.

914
00:41:26.216 --> 00:41:27.252
Yes, there is!

915
00:41:27.342 --> 00:41:29.083
No, there is not.

916
00:41:29.177 --> 00:41:30.384
Trust me on this one.

917
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:32.302
Get a hold of yourself, man!

918
00:41:32.389 --> 00:41:33.549
This is no time to act crazy!

919
00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.677
You the one
acting crazy, crazy!

920
00:41:36.059 --> 00:41:38.301
You're right,
you're right, you're right.

921
00:41:38.395 --> 00:41:39.511
I'm sorry.

922
00:41:39.604 --> 00:41:41.436
I haven't been myself
since the, uh...

923
00:41:42.232 --> 00:41:43.232
The, uh...

924
00:41:43.316 --> 00:41:45.308
Don't cry.

925
00:41:46.361 --> 00:41:48.227
Oh, no!

926
00:41:50.282 --> 00:41:52.740
No, no. It's not all that.
Just relax.

927
00:41:52.868 --> 00:41:54.905
It's my fault, kinda.

928
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:57.236
Not really, but still...

929
00:41:57.456 --> 00:41:58.992
- Hey, um...
- My brother.

930
00:41:59.082 --> 00:42:01.242
You just need a little time,
man. Things will work out.

931
00:42:01.293 --> 00:42:03.159
- You think?
- Yeah!

932
00:42:03.336 --> 00:42:05.328
So, look, um...

933
00:42:05.422 --> 00:42:06.629
I'm gonna take off,

934
00:42:06.715 --> 00:42:08.832
and you should just
go home, okay?

935
00:42:08.925 --> 00:42:10.006
Okay.

936
00:42:10.093 --> 00:42:11.504
All right. Hey,
good luck, dog.

937
00:42:12.137 --> 00:42:13.924
- Wait! Uh...
- What, man?

938
00:42:14.181 --> 00:42:16.298
- I didn't catch your name.
- Oscar.

939
00:42:16.433 --> 00:42:18.470
- I'm Lenny. Hi.
- Hi.

940
00:42:18.685 --> 00:42:20.517
Where... Where...
Where do you live?

941
00:42:20.645 --> 00:42:22.477
Lenny, where I come from,

942
00:42:22.564 --> 00:42:25.147
fish don't like to get
grabbed by sharks, okay?

943
00:42:25.275 --> 00:42:26.811
- Sorry.
- Now, go home!

944
00:42:26.943 --> 00:42:28.525
There is no home
for me anymore.

945
00:42:28.612 --> 00:42:29.648
Don't you
understand that?

946
00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:31.460
You're too big to be
grabbing on me.

947
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:32.981
- Take me home with you.
- Shh!

948
00:42:33.075 --> 00:42:34.441
You won't notice
I'm there.

949
00:42:34.576 --> 00:42:36.283
I'm like the invisible shark.

950
00:42:39.081 --> 00:42:40.288
Are you crazy?

951
00:42:40.415 --> 00:42:42.498
Please! I'm begging you!

952
00:42:42.584 --> 00:42:43.916
Don't leave me alone!

953
00:42:44.044 --> 00:42:45.125
Shh!

954
00:42:45.212 --> 00:42:48.046
Yo! Put your fins
on the wall where I can see 'em!

955
00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:49.376
Shh!

956
00:42:51.843 --> 00:42:53.129
Gotcha!

957
00:42:53.386 --> 00:42:54.922
Hey! Yo, the shorties!

958
00:42:55.055 --> 00:42:57.138
- Oscar!
- What y'all doing here?

959
00:42:57.265 --> 00:42:59.006
- Check out my mad burner.
- Check it out.

960
00:42:59.101 --> 00:43:00.637
<i>Whoomp, there it is</i>

961
00:43:00.936 --> 00:43:02.143
How ya like that?

962
00:43:02.229 --> 00:43:04.221
Y'all kids got
some skills.

963
00:43:04.564 --> 00:43:06.100
- It's wild style, dude.
- Mmm-hmm.

964
00:43:06.191 --> 00:43:07.557
What did I tell you?

965
00:43:07.818 --> 00:43:09.400
You kids shouldn't
even be doing this.

966
00:43:09.528 --> 00:43:12.191
And besides, it's not safe
to be out here at night.

967
00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.647
It is now, bro-bro!
You the Sharkslayer!

968
00:43:14.741 --> 00:43:15.741
- Yeah, bro.
- Yeah.

969
00:43:15.826 --> 00:43:17.317
- Sharkslayer?
- What was that?

970
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:20.486
Sometimes I'll be
coughing for nothing.

971
00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:22.225
Look, I just need you
off of these streets.

972
00:43:22.249 --> 00:43:23.851
- Oh, come on, Oscar.
- Get your butts home.

973
00:43:23.875 --> 00:43:26.104
I know your moms. I'm gonna
tell 'em y'all doing bad stuff.

974
00:43:26.128 --> 00:43:28.165
Let's go make
Mr. Sykes puff up.

975
00:43:28.255 --> 00:43:29.255
Yeah!

976
00:43:29.464 --> 00:43:31.025
- Bye, Oscar!
- See ya later, dude!

977
00:43:31.049 --> 00:43:34.087
Lenny! Did you see
what just happened there?

978
00:43:34.219 --> 00:43:36.882
I know. They think
you're the Sharkslayer.

979
00:43:37.305 --> 00:43:38.341
As if!

980
00:43:39.641 --> 00:43:41.883
I don't appreciate
your funky tone, actually.

981
00:43:41.977 --> 00:43:43.138
No, wait up! Hey!

982
00:43:43.311 --> 00:43:44.802
I'm sorry. Seriously.

983
00:43:44.896 --> 00:43:46.307
I don't want you mad at me,

984
00:43:46.565 --> 00:43:50.400
and I certainly don't want you
to slay me.

985
00:43:50.485 --> 00:43:51.646
You having a good time, huh?

986
00:43:51.778 --> 00:43:52.985
You're enjoying yourself?

987
00:43:54.364 --> 00:43:57.983
Well, for your information,
I am the Sharkslayer!

988
00:43:58.076 --> 00:44:01.194
Oscar the Sharkslayer.
That's what people be saying.

989
00:44:02.289 --> 00:44:04.281
Wait. You mean you...

990
00:44:04.374 --> 00:44:05.535
Yeah.

991
00:44:05.959 --> 00:44:07.450
When the anchor...

992
00:44:09.754 --> 00:44:11.165
Oh, you're a liar.

993
00:44:11.256 --> 00:44:13.168
Hey, I didn't lie,
all right?

994
00:44:13.341 --> 00:44:14.422
All right, I lied.

995
00:44:14.634 --> 00:44:16.591
But it was a little lie!
Come on!

996
00:44:16.678 --> 00:44:18.089
Who's it gonna hurt anyway?

997
00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:19.824
Go ahead. I'm not
explaining myself to you.

998
00:44:19.848 --> 00:44:21.808
- You know what? You're on your own!
- No problem.

999
00:44:22.517 --> 00:44:26.932
And if, God forbid, someone
should, oh, I don't know,

1000
00:44:27.314 --> 00:44:30.853
find out the truth about the
Sharkslayer on my way back...

1001
00:44:30.984 --> 00:44:32.976
- You wouldn't.
- I would.

1002
00:44:34.654 --> 00:44:35.986
Uh...

1003
00:44:37.908 --> 00:44:39.365
Come here!

1004
00:44:40.118 --> 00:44:42.986
Of course you can
come with me.

1005
00:44:44.372 --> 00:44:46.204
But, you know, I mean,
you're a shark,

1006
00:44:46.291 --> 00:44:47.748
and I'm a sharkslayer.

1007
00:44:47.834 --> 00:44:49.666
So we can't be seen together.

1008
00:44:50.545 --> 00:44:51.626
You dig, dog?

1009
00:44:51.713 --> 00:44:52.794
Dig! Dug.

1010
00:44:53.131 --> 00:44:54.417
Dug dig. Dig dog.

1011
00:44:54.507 --> 00:44:56.339
Yeah. Yo, diggy dog!

1012
00:44:56.509 --> 00:44:57.716
Just... Come on!

1013
00:45:01.223 --> 00:45:02.464
Okay, Lenny.

1014
00:45:02.557 --> 00:45:04.799
Follow my every move,
and don't make a sound.

1015
00:45:04.935 --> 00:45:05.995
You got it.

1016
00:45:06.019 --> 00:45:07.226
Ooh, an echo.

1017
00:45:07.395 --> 00:45:08.977
Echo.

1018
00:45:09.064 --> 00:45:11.181
Now, batting for the
Southside Sharks, number 15...

1019
00:45:11.274 --> 00:45:13.391
Ow! It's not okay to hit!

1020
00:45:18.865 --> 00:45:20.072
<i>Ain't nothing to it</i>

1021
00:45:21.243 --> 00:45:23.986
<i>If you wanna get down
We can do it, do it</i>

1022
00:45:24.079 --> 00:45:25.991
<i>Ain't nothing to it</i>

1023
00:45:31.127 --> 00:45:33.244
<i>Keep stepping
With your new suede shoes on</i>

1024
00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:35.747
<i>Boys and girls
Let's all sing along</i>

1025
00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.378
<i>Everybodyjust get
On a good foot</i>

1026
00:45:39.261 --> 00:45:41.093
<i>Oh, Lord</i>

1027
00:45:41.179 --> 00:45:43.136
<i>- Ooh ooh
- Get on a good foot</i>

1028
00:45:43.932 --> 00:45:45.343
<i>Oh, Lord</i>

1029
00:45:45.433 --> 00:45:46.799
- Ooh-whee.
- Shh!

1030
00:45:46.893 --> 00:45:48.009
<i>Get on a good foot</i>

1031
00:45:48.728 --> 00:45:49.889
Ow!

1032
00:45:50.021 --> 00:45:51.262
Aah! Ow!

1033
00:45:56.111 --> 00:45:57.227
Get your tail in there!

1034
00:45:57.362 --> 00:45:59.149
Think anybody
heard that? Ooh!

1035
00:45:59.239 --> 00:46:00.605
Ow!

1036
00:46:02.284 --> 00:46:04.697
Who was that? Huh?
Who? Who's out there?

1037
00:46:04.786 --> 00:46:06.652
Yo, Crazy Joe!

1038
00:46:06.746 --> 00:46:08.362
I thought I heard
something.

1039
00:46:08.456 --> 00:46:09.913
Did you get that shark?

1040
00:46:10.041 --> 00:46:12.454
You have no idea, Joe.

1041
00:46:12.544 --> 00:46:14.080
That's great!

1042
00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:15.877
Well, gotta go. My show's on.

1043
00:46:22.846 --> 00:46:25.054
All right, we're safe.
For now.

1044
00:46:25.724 --> 00:46:27.966
- Ah. Hey, a bed!
- Huh?

1045
00:46:28.184 --> 00:46:30.642
Oh! Oh, yeah. That's good.

1046
00:46:30.729 --> 00:46:32.595
Oh, that's heaven. Yeah.

1047
00:46:32.689 --> 00:46:34.931
Oh, snuggly,

1048
00:46:35.025 --> 00:46:36.891
buggly, wuggly.

1049
00:46:37.569 --> 00:46:39.185
I love you, man.

1050
00:46:39.321 --> 00:46:40.857
Whoa! Hold up!

1051
00:46:40.947 --> 00:46:42.779
You're my new best friend.

1052
00:46:42.866 --> 00:46:44.073
Stop it.

1053
00:46:44.159 --> 00:46:46.993
Okay, you wanna
be friends? Fine.

1054
00:46:47.245 --> 00:46:48.907
But we gotta lay down
some rules.

1055
00:46:49.372 --> 00:46:50.658
Rule number one,

1056
00:46:50.749 --> 00:46:55.244
no "snuggly, buggly,"
whatever that just was.

1057
00:46:55.337 --> 00:46:56.794
You got it. Anything else?

1058
00:46:57.088 --> 00:46:58.088
Rule number two,

1059
00:46:58.173 --> 00:47:00.130
and this is the most
important rule.

1060
00:47:00.258 --> 00:47:02.796
In the event that
possibly you get hungry...

1061
00:47:02.927 --> 00:47:04.919
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
eat anyone.

1062
00:47:05.013 --> 00:47:06.174
In case you haven't noticed,

1063
00:47:06.264 --> 00:47:08.051
I'm different from
the other sharks.

1064
00:47:08.141 --> 00:47:11.225
Let's put it that way,
leave it at that. Good night.

1065
00:47:11.353 --> 00:47:13.345
- Define "different."
- You'll laugh.

1066
00:47:13.438 --> 00:47:14.599
I'm not gonna laugh.

1067
00:47:14.689 --> 00:47:17.682
That's what you say, and then
what happens later? You laugh.

1068
00:47:17.817 --> 00:47:19.103
Lenny, I give you my word.

1069
00:47:21.321 --> 00:47:23.028
Okay. I will tell you.

1070
00:47:23.323 --> 00:47:26.532
I'm... I'm a vegetarian.

1071
00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:33.322
Hold up.

1072
00:47:35.794 --> 00:47:36.830
So, that's it?

1073
00:47:36.961 --> 00:47:38.793
What do you mean,
"That's it?"

1074
00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.042
You're the first fish
I ever told.

1075
00:47:41.174 --> 00:47:43.666
I'm so tired of
keeping it all a secret.

1076
00:47:43.885 --> 00:47:45.877
- And my dad...
- Whoa! Hey!

1077
00:47:46.012 --> 00:47:48.846
He'll never accept me.
What's wrong with me?

1078
00:47:49.599 --> 00:47:51.556
Nothing is wrong
with you, man.

1079
00:47:51.643 --> 00:47:54.260
I think all sharks
should be like you.

1080
00:47:54.562 --> 00:47:56.599
That's sweet of you to say.

1081
00:47:56.689 --> 00:47:59.727
And stop blaming yourself
for what happened.

1082
00:47:59.859 --> 00:48:00.975
Really?

1083
00:48:01.069 --> 00:48:02.901
If you wanna blame anybody,
blame me.

1084
00:48:02.987 --> 00:48:04.853
If I hadn't been out there
in the first place,

1085
00:48:04.948 --> 00:48:06.008
none of this would
have happened.

1086
00:48:06.032 --> 00:48:07.068
Yeah.

1087
00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.817
Gee, if Pop knew that,
he'd ice you for sure.

1088
00:48:10.954 --> 00:48:12.741
"Ice"?

1089
00:48:12.831 --> 00:48:14.413
What is he, the Godfather
or something?

1090
00:48:14.541 --> 00:48:16.373
- Yeah.
- What you mean, "Yeah"?

1091
00:48:16.501 --> 00:48:17.617
Yeah, he is.

1092
00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:21.837
Hey, are you all right?

1093
00:48:27.512 --> 00:48:29.595
- I told ya!
- I'm doing it!

1094
00:48:29.681 --> 00:48:31.138
X, circle, X, X,
double left, square,

1095
00:48:31.224 --> 00:48:32.368
right trigger, down,
square, square.

1096
00:48:32.392 --> 00:48:33.758
Oh! Double square.

1097
00:48:33.852 --> 00:48:34.933
- Respect.
- Respect.

1098
00:48:35.019 --> 00:48:36.635
Oh, yeah? Well,
I've got news for you.

1099
00:48:36.729 --> 00:48:38.129
The Sharkslayer
made me his manager,

1100
00:48:38.189 --> 00:48:40.727
so I'm now what I like to call
"untouchable."

1101
00:48:40.817 --> 00:48:41.817
You hear me?

1102
00:48:41.901 --> 00:48:43.688
- Sykes.
- Hey, Oscar.

1103
00:48:44.988 --> 00:48:47.446
Ow! Hey! Sykes.

1104
00:48:47.907 --> 00:48:50.775
There he is, my brother,
my player, the Sharkslayer.

1105
00:48:50.869 --> 00:48:52.451
- Sykes, listen...
- And another thing,

1106
00:48:52.537 --> 00:48:54.937
from now on, you're gonna have
to start paying me protection.

1107
00:48:55.123 --> 00:48:58.787
The deal is off. That shark I
killed was Don Lino's son.

1108
00:48:58.918 --> 00:49:00.159
I know. Ain't it great?

1109
00:49:00.253 --> 00:49:01.585
Not if he finds out.

1110
00:49:01.713 --> 00:49:03.774
What do you mean, "Find out"?
I've got him on phone right now.

1111
00:49:03.798 --> 00:49:06.478
That's right, Lino, I got the Sharkslayer
right here in front of me.

1112
00:49:06.676 --> 00:49:08.008
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

1113
00:49:08.928 --> 00:49:11.045
And he's gonna slay you
and all your sharks.

1114
00:49:11.222 --> 00:49:13.555
Sykes, shut up! Shut up!

1115
00:49:13.641 --> 00:49:15.633
Hey, that's good.
I like that.

1116
00:49:15.727 --> 00:49:17.639
Shut up, Lino.
Ha! Shut up!

1117
00:49:17.729 --> 00:49:19.140
What? Oh.

1118
00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:20.332
Kid, he wants to
talk to you.

1119
00:49:20.356 --> 00:49:22.473
- I'm not here.
- He's right here.

1120
00:49:23.526 --> 00:49:24.767
Hello!

1121
00:49:24.861 --> 00:49:26.568
"Shut up"? "Shut up"?

1122
00:49:26.654 --> 00:49:27.986
You don't tell me,
"shut up."

1123
00:49:28.114 --> 00:49:29.754
I tell you, "shut up."

1124
00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.407
- Hello?
- How you doing?

1125
00:49:31.493 --> 00:49:32.887
Let me have a pie
with everything on it.

1126
00:49:32.911 --> 00:49:34.493
Anchovies,
meatballs, mushrooms.

1127
00:49:34.579 --> 00:49:35.695
- Luca.
- Oh.

1128
00:49:35.788 --> 00:49:38.405
Hi, Boss, what are you doing
working in a pizza joint?

1129
00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.492
- Get off the phone!
- But I'm hungry.

1130
00:49:42.212 --> 00:49:44.295
My guys are coming
for you, Sharkslayer.

1131
00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:47.123
They're gonna tear you
fin from fin.

1132
00:49:48.551 --> 00:49:49.917
Now who's your
puff daddy? Huh?

1133
00:49:50.011 --> 00:49:51.252
Who takes care of you?
Huh? Huh?

1134
00:49:51.804 --> 00:49:53.199
Come on, you two,
we got work to do.

1135
00:49:54.307 --> 00:49:55.307
I was winning.

1136
00:49:55.475 --> 00:49:57.637
Sykes, you got it all wrong.

1137
00:49:57.727 --> 00:49:59.455
They're gonna write
songs about you, kid.

1138
00:49:59.479 --> 00:50:03.143
<i>Oh, the shark bites
With his teeth, dear</i>

1139
00:50:03.233 --> 00:50:04.233
Sing it, mon.

1140
00:50:04.317 --> 00:50:06.559
<i>And then Oscar
Kicked his butt</i>

1141
00:50:06.653 --> 00:50:08.189
Sykes! Sykes, man!

1142
00:50:08.279 --> 00:50:09.279
Come on!

1143
00:50:09.364 --> 00:50:10.400
Maybe I can help.

1144
00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:13.198
Ooh! Hey, Lola!

1145
00:50:13.493 --> 00:50:14.609
What are you doing here?

1146
00:50:14.702 --> 00:50:16.989
You just be popping up
sometimes, places.

1147
00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:19.743
Well, you said to wait, so...

1148
00:50:21.084 --> 00:50:22.084
I've been waiting.

1149
00:50:22.168 --> 00:50:23.500
Uh...

1150
00:50:23.586 --> 00:50:25.578
Look, uh, I don't have
a lot of time

1151
00:50:25.672 --> 00:50:28.380
for the whole hand-clappy,
making-the-lights-go-off,

1152
00:50:28.466 --> 00:50:30.253
music-playing-in-the-dark
thing, you know?

1153
00:50:30.343 --> 00:50:31.629
What are you afraid of?

1154
00:50:31.803 --> 00:50:33.294
Afraid?

1155
00:50:33.388 --> 00:50:34.674
Yeah, that's funny.

1156
00:50:34.806 --> 00:50:37.014
I ain't afraid of nothing.
It's just... Ooh!

1157
00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:39.763
Oh, baby,
you are so tense.

1158
00:50:39.852 --> 00:50:41.514
Yeah, I've been
stressed lately.

1159
00:50:41.604 --> 00:50:45.097
You know, protecting the reef.
I do that by myself, you know.

1160
00:50:45.191 --> 00:50:47.023
It's just... Just crazy.

1161
00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:49.443
It's just too much.
It's piling up.

1162
00:50:49.529 --> 00:50:52.021
Yeah. Just one thing
on top of the other.

1163
00:50:52.156 --> 00:50:54.364
Actually, I was thinking
about retiring.

1164
00:50:55.243 --> 00:50:57.200
- You don't wanna do that.
- I don't?

1165
00:50:57.328 --> 00:50:59.490
You have worked
your way to the top.

1166
00:50:59.956 --> 00:51:03.791
You don't wanna go back
to the bottom, do you?

1167
00:51:03.918 --> 00:51:05.125
No.

1168
00:51:06.212 --> 00:51:07.293
No.

1169
00:51:07.714 --> 00:51:08.714
No way.

1170
00:51:08.798 --> 00:51:10.414
You just show 'em
who's boss,

1171
00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:13.133
and those sharks
will leave you alone.

1172
00:51:13.928 --> 00:51:15.294
Yeah. You're right.

1173
00:51:15.513 --> 00:51:16.720
Lenny.

1174
00:51:24.063 --> 00:51:25.063
Psst.

1175
00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:27.523
Lenny,
where are you?

1176
00:51:28.359 --> 00:51:30.066
Hello, Oscar.

1177
00:51:30.361 --> 00:51:31.522
Angie!

1178
00:51:31.821 --> 00:51:34.404
Hey. What are you doing here?

1179
00:51:34.699 --> 00:51:36.281
What, Oscar, did you
forget something?

1180
00:51:36.451 --> 00:51:37.817
Um... Uh... You know...

1181
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:40.402
Oh, maybe you
forgot your shark!

1182
00:51:42.749 --> 00:51:45.036
- Hi.
- Uh... Shark!

1183
00:51:45.335 --> 00:51:47.167
Swim, Angie. I'll cover you.

1184
00:51:47.253 --> 00:51:48.960
Quick, before it's too late.

1185
00:51:49.213 --> 00:51:51.045
- Go on without me.
- Oh, stop it.

1186
00:51:51.299 --> 00:51:53.382
Your pet shark told me
everything.

1187
00:51:53.468 --> 00:51:54.468
Dang, Lenny.

1188
00:51:54.552 --> 00:51:55.963
Why would you do that?

1189
00:51:56.095 --> 00:51:58.303
I don't know.
I like her.

1190
00:51:58.389 --> 00:52:00.051
Thank you. I like you, too.

1191
00:52:00.475 --> 00:52:03.013
What were you thinking
bringing him in here?

1192
00:52:03.144 --> 00:52:05.056
I'm still working
out the kinks.

1193
00:52:05.146 --> 00:52:07.479
"Kinks?" You lied.

1194
00:52:07.565 --> 00:52:09.682
Everybody thinks you
"slayed" the shark.

1195
00:52:09.817 --> 00:52:11.433
Who am I to tell them that
they're wrong?

1196
00:52:11.527 --> 00:52:13.814
How could you
lie to me, Oscar? Me!

1197
00:52:13.905 --> 00:52:16.238
Don't take it personally.
I lied to everybody.

1198
00:52:17.492 --> 00:52:20.735
All right, I'm sorry.
I totally betrayed you.

1199
00:52:21.537 --> 00:52:24.371
I got just one little problem
I got to take care of.

1200
00:52:24.457 --> 00:52:25.573
Oh, what's that?

1201
00:52:25.792 --> 00:52:28.910
Sharks are coming to get me!

1202
00:52:29.003 --> 00:52:31.290
And they should!
What did you expect?

1203
00:52:31.381 --> 00:52:33.247
You take credit
for killing a shark,

1204
00:52:33.341 --> 00:52:34.693
and then everything
will be fine and dandy

1205
00:52:34.717 --> 00:52:36.128
for the rest of your life?

1206
00:52:37.887 --> 00:52:39.094
Uh...

1207
00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:40.296
Yeah.

1208
00:52:40.765 --> 00:52:44.634
But don't you worry. Me and
Lenny got it. We gonna fix it.

1209
00:52:44.727 --> 00:52:46.121
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's with the "We?"

1210
00:52:46.145 --> 00:52:47.431
I don't want any part of this.

1211
00:52:47.563 --> 00:52:48.974
Too late now, veggie boy.

1212
00:52:49.065 --> 00:52:50.305
They'll be looking
for you, too.

1213
00:52:50.942 --> 00:52:52.774
Point taken. What's the plan?

1214
00:52:53.236 --> 00:52:55.603
- This is what we do.
- Oscar, here's the plan.

1215
00:52:55.738 --> 00:52:58.731
You tell the truth,
and you go home.

1216
00:53:03.162 --> 00:53:05.779
This is what we gonna do, right?

1217
00:53:05.873 --> 00:53:08.365
We gonna paint you up
all bloody. A mess, right?

1218
00:53:08.459 --> 00:53:10.542
Then you'll swim out
and meet the sharks

1219
00:53:10.628 --> 00:53:11.789
before they get here.

1220
00:53:11.879 --> 00:53:15.964
Then you gonna say,
"Stop! Don't go no farther.

1221
00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:18.334
"That Sharkslayer's
crazy, man.

1222
00:53:18.428 --> 00:53:19.714
"He beat me senseless.

1223
00:53:19.846 --> 00:53:21.929
"He's a stone-cold
killer, man."

1224
00:53:22.056 --> 00:53:23.718
You could tell 'em I'm huge.

1225
00:53:23.808 --> 00:53:25.140
Tell them I'm handsome.

1226
00:53:25.226 --> 00:53:26.342
You could throw that in.

1227
00:53:26.436 --> 00:53:28.177
You're going way too far.

1228
00:53:28.521 --> 00:53:31.855
Actually, he hasn't gone
far enough.

1229
00:53:31.983 --> 00:53:33.975
Exactly. What?

1230
00:53:34.736 --> 00:53:36.523
You need to slay a shark,

1231
00:53:37.196 --> 00:53:38.732
and I need to disappear.

1232
00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:40.572
Here's what we're gonna do.

1233
00:53:43.119 --> 00:53:45.076
<i>This is Katie Current
reporting live.</i>

1234
00:53:45.163 --> 00:53:46.904
<i>We've had unconfirmed
reports of...</i>

1235
00:53:55.214 --> 00:53:56.375
<i>Da-da-da!</i>

1236
00:53:56.466 --> 00:53:58.879
<i>Look! It's the Sharkslayer!</i>

1237
00:54:13.024 --> 00:54:14.856
<i>Da-da-da-da</i>

1238
00:54:19.489 --> 00:54:21.697
<i>Holy mackerel!
Did we get that?</i>

1239
00:54:21.824 --> 00:54:23.941
Hey, Ang.
Oscar's on the TV.

1240
00:54:24.577 --> 00:54:26.819
<i>Show me that.
Go ahead with your bad self.</i>

1241
00:54:27.038 --> 00:54:28.245
Ugh.

1242
00:54:29.749 --> 00:54:31.509
Do you hear them, Lenny?

1243
00:54:31.584 --> 00:54:33.576
They are going crazy.
They love us.

1244
00:54:33.711 --> 00:54:35.794
- They love you. They hate me.
- What?

1245
00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.880
Can we switch sides?
Maybe I can be the Fishslayer.

1246
00:54:37.965 --> 00:54:39.085
They'll never see it coming.

1247
00:54:39.217 --> 00:54:43.052
Come on. You sell this, you'll
never have to go home again.

1248
00:54:43.137 --> 00:54:44.719
You can start a new life.

1249
00:54:44.806 --> 00:54:46.047
Give me a growl.

1250
00:54:46.224 --> 00:54:47.340
Okay.

1251
00:54:56.442 --> 00:54:57.442
Like that?

1252
00:54:57.819 --> 00:55:00.186
That was... pretty good.

1253
00:55:00.655 --> 00:55:01.691
Let's go.

1254
00:55:03.908 --> 00:55:04.968
Is that all you're offering?

1255
00:55:04.992 --> 00:55:07.780
Do you understand how huge my client is?
Turn on your TV right now.

1256
00:55:10.456 --> 00:55:14.416
Wait, Lenny. Hold up.
Lenny! Lenny! Lenny! Lenny!

1257
00:55:16.295 --> 00:55:18.002
Turn off your TV!
Turn off your TV!

1258
00:55:22.093 --> 00:55:24.585
Don't swallow.

1259
00:55:24.679 --> 00:55:27.137
- Oscar?
- No. It's Pinocchio.

1260
00:55:27.223 --> 00:55:29.306
Of course it's me.
Why did you do that?

1261
00:55:29.392 --> 00:55:30.678
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

1262
00:55:31.143 --> 00:55:34.557
Sorry is when you step
on somebody's fin at the movie theater.

1263
00:55:34.689 --> 00:55:35.975
Sorry is when you say,

1264
00:55:36.065 --> 00:55:39.103
"When is the baby due?"
and the person is just fat.

1265
00:55:39.569 --> 00:55:43.859
This is as far away from sorry
as you could possibly get.

1266
00:55:43.948 --> 00:55:46.861
But, Oscar, I think
I'm gonna puke.

1267
00:55:46.951 --> 00:55:48.408
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1268
00:55:48.494 --> 00:55:51.828
Lenny, just open up
nice and easy.

1269
00:56:02.008 --> 00:56:04.466
Are you not entertained?

1270
00:56:04.552 --> 00:56:05.552
Go, Oscar, man!

1271
00:56:05.678 --> 00:56:08.045
You can't handle the truth!

1272
00:56:08.139 --> 00:56:09.471
Go get 'em, Oscar!

1273
00:56:09.599 --> 00:56:11.340
You had me at hello!

1274
00:56:13.394 --> 00:56:14.635
Turn your TV back on.

1275
00:56:14.729 --> 00:56:16.729
What are you doing turning
your TV off? Turn it on!

1276
00:56:16.814 --> 00:56:18.350
Yippee-ki-yay!

1277
00:56:18.441 --> 00:56:19.441
Go, Oscar!

1278
00:56:20.651 --> 00:56:21.767
Whoo-hoo!

1279
00:56:33.581 --> 00:56:35.117
This reef is huge.

1280
00:56:35.207 --> 00:56:37.494
How we supposed to find
the Sharkslayer?

1281
00:56:48.846 --> 00:56:50.633
This is it, Lenny.
Big finish.

1282
00:56:50.723 --> 00:56:52.134
Just like we practiced.

1283
00:56:52.266 --> 00:56:54.474
- The flying fish.
- The flying fish?

1284
00:56:57.271 --> 00:56:59.513
A little help here, buddy boy.

1285
00:56:59.649 --> 00:57:00.649
Sorry.

1286
00:57:00.775 --> 00:57:02.937
Thank you. Whoa.

1287
00:57:22.254 --> 00:57:25.088
Curse you, Sharkslayer!

1288
00:57:41.023 --> 00:57:45.233
Yeah. And you tell
Don Lame-O

1289
00:57:45.361 --> 00:57:46.897
that I don't never,
ever, ever, ever,

1290
00:57:46.988 --> 00:57:51.198
ever, never wanna see
another shark on this reef again.

1291
00:57:51.951 --> 00:57:53.067
- Ever!
- Oh!

1292
00:57:54.537 --> 00:57:55.903
Remember this name,

1293
00:57:56.205 --> 00:57:59.073
Oscar the Sharkslayer!

1294
00:57:59.208 --> 00:58:00.995
Aha! You see?
You see? Huh?

1295
00:58:01.085 --> 00:58:08.749
<i>Oscar, bumaye! Oscar, bumaye!</i>

1296
00:58:09.051 --> 00:58:10.917
Ah! Oh, look at Oscar.

1297
00:58:11.012 --> 00:58:15.096
<i>Oscar, bumaye!</i>

1298
00:58:15.182 --> 00:58:17.014
Whoo! Hey, Lo...

1299
00:58:17.893 --> 00:58:20.886
<i>Seems the Sharkslayer not
only conquered a few sharks today,</i>

1300
00:58:21.022 --> 00:58:22.433
<i>but maybe a few hearts.</i>

1301
00:58:22.565 --> 00:58:26.354
<i>Has the reef's most eligible
bachelor been snapped up?</i>

1302
00:58:26.444 --> 00:58:30.563
<i>I'm Katie Current, here live watching
the Sharkslayer making out.</i>

1303
00:58:32.783 --> 00:58:34.866
Hey, Angie, can you
hand me the blue one?

1304
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:38.320
Thank you.

1305
00:58:38.414 --> 00:58:41.077
Hey! Who stepped
in the room?

1306
00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:43.460
Ho, ho, ho, yeah!

1307
00:58:43.544 --> 00:58:45.752
Oscar and Lenny.
What a team, baby.

1308
00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:48.623
- Unh. Give me some fin.
- High fin. Low fin.

1309
00:58:49.175 --> 00:58:50.757
Yo, did you see me?
I was like...

1310
00:58:53.512 --> 00:58:54.512
Ha-ha! I was great!

1311
00:58:54.597 --> 00:58:56.884
When you punched me,
and the crowd was, "Ahh!"

1312
00:58:57.016 --> 00:58:58.348
They ate it up.

1313
00:58:58.476 --> 00:59:00.559
Angie, you ain't know
I had it in me, did you?

1314
00:59:00.644 --> 00:59:02.385
It was like an Oscar-splosion.

1315
00:59:02.521 --> 00:59:04.513
- How good was I?
- You was the bomb.

1316
00:59:04.648 --> 00:59:05.809
Thank you. Thank you.

1317
00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:07.482
And hey, hey, hey.

1318
00:59:07.568 --> 00:59:09.059
Casanova.

1319
00:59:09.195 --> 00:59:11.437
I saw your big finish
on the news.

1320
00:59:11.572 --> 00:59:13.359
Nice smooch, lover boy.

1321
00:59:13.491 --> 00:59:16.700
Ixnay on the iskay, man.
That's private. It's private.

1322
00:59:17.078 --> 00:59:19.445
Private? The entire reef
saw you do it.

1323
00:59:19.538 --> 00:59:21.655
Hey, whoa, somebody's
in a bad mood.

1324
00:59:21.749 --> 00:59:23.602
Ang, let me see the smile.
Show me the smile, baby.

1325
00:59:23.626 --> 00:59:24.867
Knock it off.

1326
00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:26.872
Uh... What has
gotten into you?

1327
00:59:27.004 --> 00:59:28.415
Me? Oh, I swear,

1328
00:59:28.506 --> 00:59:31.715
sometimes I wanna take
your big dumb dummy-head

1329
00:59:31.801 --> 00:59:33.633
and just...

1330
00:59:33.719 --> 00:59:35.335
Ang, what is the problem?

1331
00:59:35.471 --> 00:59:37.758
There's no problem.
I don't have any problem.

1332
00:59:38.057 --> 00:59:40.014
Miss Perfect is the one
with the problem.

1333
00:59:40.142 --> 00:59:41.258
Um, hey, you guys.

1334
00:59:41.393 --> 00:59:42.554
What do you got
against Lola?

1335
00:59:42.645 --> 00:59:44.682
Not my lips,
that's for sure.

1336
00:59:44.855 --> 00:59:45.855
Ooh.

1337
00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:46.940
What's going on?

1338
00:59:47.066 --> 00:59:48.426
Uh, I'm gonna stay
out of this one.

1339
00:59:48.526 --> 00:59:50.734
Why would you
even care about Lola?

1340
00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:52.027
- I don't.
- You don't?

1341
00:59:52.113 --> 00:59:53.194
- No.
- "No," what?

1342
00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:54.862
- I don't know.
- Guys, you wanna...

1343
00:59:54.949 --> 00:59:56.360
- No!
- No!

1344
00:59:56.575 --> 00:59:59.033
Just tell me, Oscar,
'cause I'm curious.

1345
00:59:59.161 --> 01:00:00.948
Why do you think she's
interested, huh?

1346
01:00:01.038 --> 01:00:02.779
Do you think
for one minute

1347
01:00:02.873 --> 01:00:04.489
that she would
even be with you

1348
01:00:04.583 --> 01:00:06.311
if you weren't the rich
and famous Sharkslayer?

1349
01:00:06.335 --> 01:00:08.292
- Please don't fight.
- Are you that blind?

1350
01:00:08.379 --> 01:00:10.245
At least she treats me
like I'm somebody.

1351
01:00:10.381 --> 01:00:12.043
Would she love you
if you were nobody?

1352
01:00:12.174 --> 01:00:13.915
Nobody loved me
when I was nobody!

1353
01:00:14.051 --> 01:00:15.167
I did!

1354
01:00:18.472 --> 01:00:20.054
Before the money...

1355
01:00:20.724 --> 01:00:22.260
And before the fame.

1356
01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:25.097
Before the lie.

1357
01:00:25.646 --> 01:00:27.979
To me, you were
a somebody, Oscar.

1358
01:00:28.065 --> 01:00:30.682
Now you're nothing
but a fake.

1359
01:00:31.152 --> 01:00:33.109
A sham. A con.

1360
01:00:34.613 --> 01:00:35.694
You're a joke.

1361
01:00:36.365 --> 01:00:37.365
Here I come.

1362
01:00:38.242 --> 01:00:39.242
Ta-da!

1363
01:00:39.326 --> 01:00:40.783

1364
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:43.032
<i>The whale-washing dolphin</i>

1365
01:00:52.298 --> 01:00:54.085
- Angie...
- No. Forget it.

1366
01:00:54.592 --> 01:00:55.592
Just go,

1367
01:00:55.676 --> 01:00:56.837
'cause I'm tired
of hearing

1368
01:00:56.927 --> 01:00:59.795
how everything you had
in your life wasn't good enough.

1369
01:01:00.347 --> 01:01:01.758
Including me.

1370
01:01:10.357 --> 01:01:11.357
Angie.

1371
01:01:11.442 --> 01:01:14.150
Oh, honey, I'm...
I'm sorry.

1372
01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:16.606
Go... Go back
and do it again.

1373
01:01:19.575 --> 01:01:21.032
Hey, come on.

1374
01:01:23.287 --> 01:01:24.744
It'll be okay.

1375
01:01:34.965 --> 01:01:39.460
<i>One shot to your heart
Without breaking your skin</i>

1376
01:01:40.095 --> 01:01:44.590
<i>No one has the power
To hurt you like your kin</i>

1377
01:01:45.142 --> 01:01:46.599
<i>Kept it inside</i>

01:01:47.061 --> 01:01:49.849
<i>Didn't tell no one else...</i>

<i>You can't handle the truth!</i>

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.187
<i>You've got shark breath!</i>

1381
01:01:55.527 --> 01:02:00.318
<i>And now you only have
Yourself to blame</i>

1382
01:02:00.407 --> 01:02:01.898

How many times
I have to tell you?

1390
01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:24.137
It's past your bedtime.

1391
01:02:24.223 --> 01:02:25.464
Go on. Go on.

1392
01:02:27.393 --> 01:02:29.305
Hey, what are you kids up to?

1393
01:02:29.728 --> 01:02:30.969
That looks pretty good.

1394
01:02:31.063 --> 01:02:32.503
You guys should
do this for a living.

1395
01:02:33.065 --> 01:02:34.806
<i>Ooh</i>

1396
01:02:35.359 --> 01:02:39.228
<i>You can fly, fly, fly, fly</i>

1397
01:02:39.989 --> 01:02:44.654
<i>You can live or you can die</i>

1398
01:02:44.743 --> 01:02:49.534
<i>You know that life
Is a choice you make</i>

1399
01:02:49.873 --> 01:02:54.834
<i>You can give or you can take</i>

1400
01:02:55.129 --> 01:02:59.248
<i>You can fly, fly, fly, fly</i>

1401
01:02:59.925 --> 01:03:04.215
<i>You can fly, fly, fly, fly</i>

1402
01:03:04.638 --> 01:03:07.881
It slays hemorrhoids
like Oscar slays sharks.

1403
01:03:08.559 --> 01:03:10.551
Oh. Hey, Oscar.

1404
01:03:11.312 --> 01:03:12.553
Preparation O.

1405
01:03:15.065 --> 01:03:18.274
Angie was right. I am a joke.

1406
01:03:20.362 --> 01:03:21.819
Hey, Sharkslayer.

1407
01:03:22.489 --> 01:03:23.730
Why are you
out here?

1408
01:03:24.116 --> 01:03:25.698
All your friends
are inside.

1409
01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:27.946
Not all my friends.

1410
01:03:28.245 --> 01:03:30.908
You mean that little bottom-feeder
from the Whale Wash?

1411
01:03:31.498 --> 01:03:34.582
Forget about her.
She's a nobody.

1412
01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.872
No. I'm the nobody.

1413
01:03:38.922 --> 01:03:40.538
Oh, let me guess.

1414
01:03:40.632 --> 01:03:42.919
She told you
that she loves you.

1415
01:03:43.344 --> 01:03:44.630
Is that it?

1416
01:03:47.139 --> 01:03:49.176
It's not like you feel
the same way about her.

1417
01:03:58.233 --> 01:04:00.566
I don't think this
is gonna work out.

1418
01:04:00.694 --> 01:04:03.232
Wait. Are you dumping me?

1419
01:04:07.868 --> 01:04:09.484
Let me explain
something to you.

1420
01:04:09.953 --> 01:04:11.639
<i>We're gonna party
like it's your birthday</i>

1421
01:04:15.084 --> 01:04:16.291
Ha! Young love.

1422
01:04:24.426 --> 01:04:25.633
<i>Ooh</i>

1423
01:04:25.719 --> 01:04:28.052
<i>Sugar pie, honey bunch</i>

1424
01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:31.218
<i>You know that I love you</i>

1425
01:04:32.684 --> 01:04:35.176
<i>I can't help myself</i>

1426
01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:37.853
<i>I love you
and nobody else...</i>

1427
01:04:37.981 --> 01:04:40.314
- Hey, Oscar!
- I can't talk. I got to find Angie.

1428
01:04:40.609 --> 01:04:42.896
I need to tell her I love her.

1429
01:04:43.404 --> 01:04:45.566
<i>You come and you go</i>

1430
01:04:45.656 --> 01:04:47.238
Way to go, Oscar!

1431
01:04:47.324 --> 01:04:48.843
Irie. Whale Wash...

1432
01:04:48.867 --> 01:04:49.903
Gimme the phone.

1433
01:04:49.993 --> 01:04:52.110
Where you get
a whale of a wash.

1434
01:04:52.287 --> 01:04:54.028
Gimme back the phone.
And the price is...

1435
01:04:54.373 --> 01:04:57.616
Very, very low, considering
how good the wash is.

1436
01:04:57.751 --> 01:04:58.832
Good one, Ernie.

1437
01:04:58.919 --> 01:05:00.772
How many times do I have to
tell you? It's "gosh."

1438
01:05:00.796 --> 01:05:03.789
"You get a whale of a wash
and the price, oh, my gosh."

1439
01:05:03.882 --> 01:05:05.568
Me get it, mon. Whale Wash.

1440
01:05:05.592 --> 01:05:07.629
Rhymes with "gosh."

1441
01:05:07.719 --> 01:05:09.210
Give me that.
Get out of here.

1442
01:05:09.304 --> 01:05:10.761
Go be useless someplace else.

1443
01:05:10.848 --> 01:05:11.848
Sykes, where's Angie?

1444
01:05:11.932 --> 01:05:13.034
You tell me.

1445
01:05:13.058 --> 01:05:14.536
Whale Wash. You get
a whale of a wash...

1446
01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:16.051
Oh. Huh.

1447
01:05:16.145 --> 01:05:18.478
- It's for you.
- Huh? Hello.

1448
01:05:18.772 --> 01:05:20.792
<i>- Is this the Sharkslayer?
- Yeah. Who's this?</i>

1449
01:05:20.816 --> 01:05:23.900
It's Luca, the octo...
I mean, forget about it.

1450
01:05:24.319 --> 01:05:26.982
Now you follow these instructions
to the letter like, okay?

1451
01:05:27.239 --> 01:05:29.196
File cabinet,
top drawer.

1452
01:05:29.324 --> 01:05:30.940
<i>There's a package.
Get it.</i>

1453
01:05:32.453 --> 01:05:35.196
<i>That's right, tough guy.
We got your girl.</i>

1454
01:05:35.706 --> 01:05:37.948
<i>There's going to be
a sit-down in one hour.</i>

1455
01:05:38.041 --> 01:05:39.041
Who is it?

1456
01:05:39.126 --> 01:05:40.162
Shh!

1457
01:05:40.252 --> 01:05:43.666
Be there, if you don't wanna see her
sleeping with the fishes.

1458
01:05:45.174 --> 01:05:46.585
The dead ones.

1459
01:05:46.758 --> 01:05:48.966
Now, nod your head
if you understand.

1460
01:05:51.638 --> 01:05:53.675
Now, tell me if you
nodded your head.

1461
01:05:54.725 --> 01:05:56.057
I nodded.

1462
01:05:58.061 --> 01:06:00.394
They got Angie,
and they want a sit-down.

1463
01:06:01.565 --> 01:06:03.306
I never meant for
anybody to get hurt,

1464
01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:04.766
especially not Angie.

1465
01:06:05.611 --> 01:06:07.193
This is all my fault.

1466
01:06:07.321 --> 01:06:09.321
Classic move.
I've seen it a thousand times.

1467
01:06:09.364 --> 01:06:12.573
They take the thing you love the most,
and then they use it against you.

1468
01:06:16.663 --> 01:06:19.076
We got to go to that
sit-down and save her.

1469
01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:21.370
Whoa, whoa. I wanna
save Angie, too,

1470
01:06:21.502 --> 01:06:24.290
but I can't waltz in there and
say, "Hi, Pop. I'm a dolphin."

1471
01:06:24.421 --> 01:06:26.629
- Lenny?
- "And the Sharkslayer's a fake."

1472
01:06:26.757 --> 01:06:29.465
- Fake?
- We're gonna need a better plan.

1473
01:06:31.053 --> 01:06:32.589
This is a joke, right?
This is a joke.

1474
01:06:32.846 --> 01:06:34.633
Because I told Lino...

1475
01:06:34.765 --> 01:06:36.848
<i>Shut up, Lino! Shut up!</i>

1476
01:06:38.143 --> 01:06:39.329
Tell me
you didn't make it all up.

1477
01:06:39.353 --> 01:06:40.434
Tell me that's not Lenny.

1478
01:06:40.521 --> 01:06:42.558
Tell me you're a real
sharkslayer, please.

1479
01:06:42.648 --> 01:06:45.311
I'm sorry, Sykes. I'm not.

1480
01:06:47.861 --> 01:06:49.693
But the sharks
don't know that.

1481
01:07:16.723 --> 01:07:17.804
Stop screwing around.

1482
01:07:17.891 --> 01:07:19.536
This will never work.
We're dead. We're dead.

1483
01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:22.098
Shh. Thank you,
Sykes. Thank you.

1484
01:07:22.646 --> 01:07:25.229
And my man Sykes has just

1485
01:07:25.857 --> 01:07:29.601
begged me not to murderlize
all y'all up in here.

1486
01:07:30.028 --> 01:07:33.066
Now, I might listen to him,
but then again, I might not.

1487
01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:35.857
And that depends
on the individual behavior

1488
01:07:36.159 --> 01:07:38.151
of all the individuals
in here,

1489
01:07:38.662 --> 01:07:39.823
individually.

1490
01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.163
Ain't that right?

1491
01:07:42.249 --> 01:07:44.115
Look. He's got dolphin muscle.

1492
01:07:44.209 --> 01:07:46.701
My Uncle Vito got
whacked by one of those.

1493
01:07:46.837 --> 01:07:49.705
Which one of you sardines
called this meeting?

1494
01:07:50.173 --> 01:07:51.835
That would be me.

1495
01:07:53.802 --> 01:07:56.340
So, this is
the Sharkslayer.

1496
01:07:56.430 --> 01:07:58.262
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

1497
01:07:58.682 --> 01:08:00.469
I feel like we're
practically family.

1498
01:08:00.767 --> 01:08:02.178
You know that?
Funny, ain't it?

1499
01:08:02.644 --> 01:08:04.681
I brought my kids
into the world

1500
01:08:05.314 --> 01:08:06.896
full of love and care,

1501
01:08:07.608 --> 01:08:08.940
and you took 'em out.

1502
01:08:09.776 --> 01:08:11.142
You know who I am?

1503
01:08:11.236 --> 01:08:12.647
Do you know who I am?

1504
01:08:14.072 --> 01:08:16.155
I'm the Don, the boss

1505
01:08:16.241 --> 01:08:17.527
of the great white sharks.

1506
01:08:17.618 --> 01:08:19.530
Boss, I saved you a seat.

1507
01:08:20.787 --> 01:08:23.575
I've been running this reef
since before you was born.

1508
01:08:23.790 --> 01:08:25.782
If you thought
a guy like me

1509
01:08:25.876 --> 01:08:27.833
can't get to
a guy like you...

1510
01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:29.206
Guess what?

1511
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:31.041
You thought wrong.

1512
01:08:35.135 --> 01:08:37.377
Man, you the one
who's wrong.

1513
01:08:37.721 --> 01:08:40.054
I barely know that girl.
What's your name, miss?

1514
01:08:40.641 --> 01:08:41.921
Oh, yeah?

1515
01:08:42.726 --> 01:08:44.718
Well, I say he's bluffing.

1516
01:08:46.313 --> 01:08:47.724
<i>Marone, if I wasn't married.</i>

1517
01:08:48.190 --> 01:08:50.022
How ya doing,
pretty lady?

1518
01:08:50.233 --> 01:08:51.233
Ugh.

1519
01:08:51.526 --> 01:08:52.858
Lola.

1520
01:08:53.528 --> 01:08:54.769
We meet again.

1521
01:08:54.905 --> 01:08:56.316
You know, Sharkslayer,

1522
01:08:56.698 --> 01:09:00.112
there's only one thing
I like better than money,

1523
01:09:00.535 --> 01:09:01.821
revenge.

1524
01:09:02.537 --> 01:09:04.278
Oh, I'm in love.

1525
01:09:04.414 --> 01:09:06.531
Your shark slaying days
are over,

1526
01:09:07.125 --> 01:09:09.458
and there ain't nothing
you can do about it.

1527
01:09:24.434 --> 01:09:25.845
- Huh? What's so funny?
- Ow!

1528
01:09:26.728 --> 01:09:29.562
You got nothing. Nothing!

1529
01:09:29.773 --> 01:09:31.389
Sebastian, take her out.

1530
01:09:36.446 --> 01:09:38.529
<i>Da-da-da-da da-da-da-da</i>

1531
01:09:38.615 --> 01:09:39.731
<i>Can't touch this</i>

1532
01:09:39.825 --> 01:09:41.657
<i>Da-da-da-da da-da-da-da</i>

1533
01:09:41.743 --> 01:09:42.743
<i>Can't touch this</i>

1534
01:09:42.869 --> 01:09:44.952
<i>Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh,
uh-oh, uh-oh</i>

1535
01:09:45.038 --> 01:09:46.654
Stop! Oscar time!

1536
01:09:46.748 --> 01:09:48.910
Okay, new rules.

1537
01:09:49.376 --> 01:09:53.290
Nobody, I repeat, nobody
makes a move without my okay.

1538
01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:55.292
I am the Panama Canal, baby.

1539
01:09:55.382 --> 01:09:57.374
From now on, everything...

1540
01:09:57.467 --> 01:09:58.467
...flows through me.

1541
01:09:58.552 --> 01:10:00.544
Huh? What'd he do?
I can't see it.

1542
01:10:00.637 --> 01:10:01.673
You don't lose a tooth.

1543
01:10:01.763 --> 01:10:03.675
You don't grow one back
without my okay. Okay?

1544
01:10:03.765 --> 01:10:05.051
- Okay?
- Okay.

1545
01:10:05.142 --> 01:10:06.508
If you sneeze,

1546
01:10:06.601 --> 01:10:09.719
you don't wipe that boogie
without my okay. Okay?

1547
01:10:09.813 --> 01:10:10.929
- Okay.
- All right.

1548
01:10:11.022 --> 01:10:14.311
And you don't say "okay"
without my okay. Okay?

1549
01:10:15.694 --> 01:10:16.730
Uh-oh.

1550
01:10:17.112 --> 01:10:18.172
Okay. Thank you all
for coming.

1551
01:10:18.196 --> 01:10:19.312
Good meeting.
We got to go.

1552
01:10:19.406 --> 01:10:20.406
Oh, and one more thing.

1553
01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:22.698
What is with all y'all
living in the Love Boat?

1554
01:10:22.784 --> 01:10:23.784
Oscar.

1555
01:10:23.869 --> 01:10:25.201
Y'all supposed to
be the Mob.

1556
01:10:25.287 --> 01:10:26.949
Get yourselves
a real hideout.

1557
01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:28.116
Oscar.

1558
01:10:28.248 --> 01:10:29.910
And take a good look, Lino.

1559
01:10:30.041 --> 01:10:33.250
It's over. You're old school.

1560
01:10:33.336 --> 01:10:34.827
- Oscar!
- What?

1561
01:10:36.798 --> 01:10:37.914
Oh!

1562
01:10:38.925 --> 01:10:40.086
The horror!

1563
01:10:40.802 --> 01:10:42.088
The horror!

1564
01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:48.098
Um, excuse me.

1565
01:10:48.477 --> 01:10:49.684
Ang, are you okay?

1566
01:10:49.770 --> 01:10:51.682
No, I am not okay.

1567
01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:54.188
- He ate me!
- I couldn't take it.

1568
01:10:54.733 --> 01:10:56.395
The taste was killing me.

1569
01:10:56.485 --> 01:10:57.566
Lenny?

1570
01:10:58.945 --> 01:11:00.186
Is that you?

1571
01:11:02.824 --> 01:11:04.281
- You're alive?
- Oh.

1572
01:11:04.701 --> 01:11:06.363
I thought I lost you.

1573
01:11:07.788 --> 01:11:10.371
What are you wearing?
Huh? What is that?

1574
01:11:24.596 --> 01:11:26.337
Whoa! Ho-ho ho!

1575
01:11:26.598 --> 01:11:28.055
Hey, Boss, it's Lenny.

1576
01:11:28.141 --> 01:11:30.474
He was wearing a disguise
so we wouldn't recognize him.

1577
01:11:30.602 --> 01:11:32.719
But now he's not wearing
a disguise,

1578
01:11:32.813 --> 01:11:34.725
so we do recognize him.

1579
01:11:35.941 --> 01:11:36.941
Hi, Pop.

1580
01:11:37.025 --> 01:11:38.141
Are you
kidding me?

1581
01:11:38.568 --> 01:11:41.231
Are you kidding me?
Are you out of your mind?

1582
01:11:41.363 --> 01:11:43.355
Do you have any idea
how this looks?

1583
01:11:44.032 --> 01:11:46.399
This is the best sit-down
I've ever been to.

1584
01:11:46.868 --> 01:11:48.154
What are you doing
with this guy?

1585
01:11:48.245 --> 01:11:50.362
He took out your
flesh and blood, Frankie.

1586
01:11:50.455 --> 01:11:51.741
But, Pop,
just listen...

1587
01:11:51.873 --> 01:11:55.037
But nothing. You never
take sides against the family. Ever!

1588
01:11:55.126 --> 01:11:56.958
Hey, Don, Lino, sir.

1589
01:11:57.087 --> 01:12:00.296
It's not his fault.
This is between you and me.

1590
01:12:00.423 --> 01:12:02.005
What did I ever do to you?

1591
01:12:02.217 --> 01:12:03.708
You took Frankie away,

1592
01:12:03.802 --> 01:12:05.794
and you turned Lenny
into a dolphin!

1593
01:12:06.763 --> 01:12:08.174
I'm gonna get you.

1594
01:12:08.765 --> 01:12:09.801
Oscar, look out!

1595
01:12:09.891 --> 01:12:12.053
Oscar, swim for your life!

1596
01:12:20.151 --> 01:12:23.144
You're gonna regret the day
you became the Sharkslayer.

1597
01:12:23.238 --> 01:12:28.199
Well, well, well. Look who's
stuck in the porthole.

1598
01:12:28.326 --> 01:12:30.409
- Huh?
- You still hungry, big guy?

1599
01:12:30.829 --> 01:12:34.038
Well, say hello
to my little friends.

1600
01:12:47.178 --> 01:12:48.364
Try it again.

1601
01:12:48.388 --> 01:12:50.550
Whale Wash, you get
a whale of a wash

1602
01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.222
and the price...
Oh, my gosh!

1603
01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:55.514
All right! You got it right.
You got it right.

1604
01:12:55.645 --> 01:12:56.885
Move! Everybody,
out of the way!

1605
01:13:00.442 --> 01:13:01.478
Blow out!

1606
01:13:09.409 --> 01:13:11.992
Come on, Lino.
It's time to clean up your act.

1607
01:13:16.249 --> 01:13:17.785
Pop, leave him alone!

1608
01:13:25.842 --> 01:13:28.129
All right, Lino,
game's over.

1609
01:13:29.679 --> 01:13:31.090
Ah! Ooh!

1610
01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.768
Lenny? What are you
doing in there?

1611
01:13:37.938 --> 01:13:39.429
- Sorry.
- Where's Lino?

1612
01:13:40.315 --> 01:13:41.977
He's right behind me,
isn't he?

1613
01:13:42.067 --> 01:13:43.433
You're mine now.

1614
01:13:52.243 --> 01:13:53.243
Whoa!

1615
01:13:56.164 --> 01:13:57.746
Let's finish this,
Sharkslayer.

1616
01:13:57.874 --> 01:13:59.206
Oh, we're about to.

1617
01:14:27.529 --> 01:14:29.486
Thank you for coming
to Whale Wash.

1618
01:14:32.867 --> 01:14:37.453
Okay, somebody needs to
get me out of the bubble, today.

1619
01:14:37.998 --> 01:14:39.534
Ooh.

1620
01:14:39.666 --> 01:14:41.874
- Angie...
- The Sharkslayer has done it again.

1621
01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:45.829
This time luring two sharks
into his deathtrap of hygiene.

1622
01:14:45.922 --> 01:14:48.881
Oscar, you're the somebody
everybody wants to be.

1623
01:14:49.009 --> 01:14:50.796
- Angie!
- The top of the food chain.

1624
01:14:50.885 --> 01:14:53.298
Tell our cameras
how it feels to be you.

1625
01:14:53.388 --> 01:14:55.755
Oscar, get me out here. Quick.
I need to get a head start

1626
01:14:55.849 --> 01:14:57.636
so I can get as far away
as possible.

1627
01:14:57.726 --> 01:14:58.807
Look what you did to him.

1628
01:14:58.893 --> 01:15:00.429
It's all a big
misunderstanding.

1629
01:15:00.562 --> 01:15:02.428
- Sharkslayer, over here.
- If you'd just...

1630
01:15:02.564 --> 01:15:06.023
Sharkslayer!
Sharkslayer! Sharkslayer!

1631
01:15:06.151 --> 01:15:07.483
Sharkslayer! Sharkslayer!

1632
01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:09.356
Stop!

1633
01:15:09.446 --> 01:15:13.986
I am not a real sharkslayer!

1634
01:15:21.458 --> 01:15:23.074
I lied.

1635
01:15:23.209 --> 01:15:24.416
What?

1636
01:15:24.544 --> 01:15:27.662
And I'm not
a real financial adviser.

1637
01:15:30.008 --> 01:15:31.215
Okay.

1638
01:15:31.509 --> 01:15:33.375
It was an anchor
that killed Frankie.

1639
01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:35.573
I didn't have anything
to do with it,

1640
01:15:35.597 --> 01:15:36.597
and neither did Lenny.

1641
01:15:36.723 --> 01:15:39.261
If that was true,
why did you run away?

1642
01:15:39.851 --> 01:15:42.468
Because you always wanted me
to be like Frankie.

1643
01:15:43.438 --> 01:15:45.430
I'll never be the shark
you want me to be.

1644
01:15:46.441 --> 01:15:48.478
What is your problem?

1645
01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:50.397
So your son likes kelp.

1646
01:15:50.487 --> 01:15:52.228
So his best friend's a fish.

1647
01:15:52.322 --> 01:15:55.190
So he likes to dress
like a dolphin.

1648
01:15:55.325 --> 01:15:56.566
So what?

1649
01:15:57.035 --> 01:15:58.822
Everybody loves him

1650
01:15:58.912 --> 01:16:00.198
just the way he is.

1651
01:16:01.581 --> 01:16:02.742
Why can't you?

1652
01:16:05.543 --> 01:16:07.409
Don't make the same mistake
that I did.

1653
01:16:08.421 --> 01:16:11.505
I didn't know what I had
until I lost it.

1654
01:16:18.264 --> 01:16:19.755
Will you get me out of this?

1655
01:16:19.891 --> 01:16:22.975
So I can hug my kid
and tell him I'm sorry.

1656
01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:24.726
Pop.

1657
01:16:30.610 --> 01:16:32.192
Come here, you.

1658
01:16:34.114 --> 01:16:36.401
I love you, son,
no matter what you eat

1659
01:16:36.533 --> 01:16:38.274
or how you dress.

1660
01:16:39.536 --> 01:16:40.868
Oscar?

1661
01:16:41.329 --> 01:16:42.615
Angie?

1662
01:16:48.628 --> 01:16:50.494
Ah, Angie.

1663
01:16:51.923 --> 01:16:53.835
I wish I knew now
what I knew then.

1664
01:16:53.967 --> 01:16:56.926
I mean, I wish you knew
what I knew...

1665
01:16:57.011 --> 01:16:59.298
Uh, I mean, before this.

1666
01:16:59.430 --> 01:17:00.762
You're blowing it, man!

1667
01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:03.724
Mind your business. It's
emotional and it's pressure.

1668
01:17:04.644 --> 01:17:06.806
What I'm saying, I just...

1669
01:17:07.397 --> 01:17:09.434
I didn't need
the top of the reef.

1670
01:17:09.649 --> 01:17:12.562
Everything I wanted was
right there in front of me

1671
01:17:13.278 --> 01:17:14.439
the whole time.

1672
01:17:15.071 --> 01:17:17.484
Well, what about
being a somebody?

1673
01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.362
I'm nobody without you.

1674
01:17:29.919 --> 01:17:32.036
You're not helping.

1675
01:17:34.424 --> 01:17:37.713
Oh, come here,
you big dumb dummy-head.

1676
01:17:42.515 --> 01:17:44.097
I never told
you two this,

1677
01:17:44.184 --> 01:17:46.676
but you're the best
henchmen a guy ever had.

1678
01:17:46.769 --> 01:17:48.260
Come on. Group hug.

1679
01:17:48.521 --> 01:17:50.604
- Ow! Hey!
- Sorry, mon. Sorry.

1680
01:17:50.732 --> 01:17:52.644
Come, Sykes, try again, mon.
Go for it.

1681
01:17:52.775 --> 01:17:54.186
Oh, forget it.
The moment's gone.

1682
01:17:54.944 --> 01:17:56.731
So, uh, Lino...

1683
01:17:56.821 --> 01:17:58.813
Uh, Don...

1684
01:17:59.157 --> 01:18:01.524
We cool, right?
Like, the reef is safe.

1685
01:18:01.618 --> 01:18:04.656
You know, walk the streets without...
Aah! You know.

1686
01:18:05.413 --> 01:18:07.120
Yeah. We're cool.

1687
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:11.746
Oscar, excuse me.
Oscar.

1688
01:18:11.836 --> 01:18:14.749
You've lost everything
you lied so hard to achieve.

1689
01:18:14.881 --> 01:18:16.793
Tell me, what's
next for you?

1690
01:18:19.427 --> 01:18:21.009
Come on.
Everyone's waiting,

1691
01:18:21.512 --> 01:18:23.344
Mr. Manager.

1692
01:18:23.473 --> 01:18:26.056
Just got to put the finishing
touch on my new desk.

1693
01:18:26.226 --> 01:18:27.433
Love you, Pop.

1694
01:18:28.102 --> 01:18:30.435
- Yo, dog!
- Sykes!

1695
01:18:30.521 --> 01:18:32.558
All right, partner,
let's see what you can do.

1696
01:18:33.983 --> 01:18:36.600
Sykes and Oscar's Whale Wash

1697
01:18:36.694 --> 01:18:39.107
is now open for business!

1698
01:18:40.406 --> 01:18:41.863
Yo, E, B,

1699
01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:45.489
let's get this party
bump-bump-bumping!

1700
01:18:45.662 --> 01:18:49.326
Yo, yo! It's E and B
on the wheels of steel!

1701
01:18:49.457 --> 01:18:51.039
Yo, Christina, Missy,

1702
01:18:51.125 --> 01:18:53.868
how about we have
a little Oscar-licious fun?

1703
01:18:53.962 --> 01:18:56.045
<i>Y'all small tuna fish
I'm one big catch</i>

1704
01:18:56.130 --> 01:18:58.497
<i>You might not ever get rich</i>

1705
01:18:58.758 --> 01:19:00.590
Warm it up.
I be warming it up.

1706
01:19:00.718 --> 01:19:03.677
<i>Let me tell you, it's better
Than digging a ditch</i>

1707
01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:07.673
<i>There ain't no telling
Who you might meet</i>

1708
01:19:08.476 --> 01:19:11.810
<i>A movie star
Or maybe a common thief</i>

1709
01:19:11.896 --> 01:19:13.307
<i>Working at the car wash</i>

1710
01:19:13.439 --> 01:19:15.852
Okay, Jimbo, let it go!

1711
01:19:16.567 --> 01:19:18.399
<i>At the car wash, yeah</i>

1712
01:19:18.653 --> 01:19:20.144
<i>Yeah</i>

1713
01:19:20.238 --> 01:19:21.774
<i>At the car wash</i>

1714
01:19:21.864 --> 01:19:23.150
<i>Sing it with me</i>

1715
01:19:23.241 --> 01:19:24.277
Hey, Angie.

1716
01:19:24.409 --> 01:19:25.775
Sorry Pop and I are late,

1717
01:19:25.868 --> 01:19:27.404
but we brought
some new customers.

1718
01:19:27.912 --> 01:19:29.278
Hey, how you doing?

1719
01:19:29.414 --> 01:19:30.780
Wow!

1720
01:19:30.999 --> 01:19:32.490
Okay, guys, come on in!

1721
01:19:33.251 --> 01:19:36.915
<i>This ain't no place to be
If you plan on being a star</i>

1722
01:19:37.505 --> 01:19:40.623
<i>Let me tell ya
It's always cool</i>

1723
01:19:41.342 --> 01:19:44.380
<i>And the boss don't mind
Sometimes if you're acting Like a fool</i>

1724
01:19:44.721 --> 01:19:46.713
<i>Working at the car wash</i>

1725
01:19:46.848 --> 01:19:48.248
No. Snap it. You're
not snapping it.

1726
01:19:48.349 --> 01:19:50.090
I'm snapping it.
I'm snapping it.

1727
01:19:50.184 --> 01:19:51.870
It's okay. A lot of
Great Whites can't do it, yo.

1728
01:19:51.894 --> 01:19:52.894
- Yo?
- Yo, what's up?

1729
01:19:53.021 --> 01:19:54.021
What's up with what?

1730
01:19:54.105 --> 01:19:55.846
Yo, yo, yo. Yo, yo, yo.

1731
01:19:55.982 --> 01:19:58.895
You say "yo" one more time,
and I'm gonna yo you.

1732
01:19:59.027 --> 01:20:00.188
I'm sorry.

1733
01:20:00.361 --> 01:20:02.444
Okay, dude,
I pimped your hide.

1734
01:20:02.530 --> 01:20:03.530
All right
