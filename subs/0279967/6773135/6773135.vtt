you must work together.

349
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.200
Like the
sun and rain.

350
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.680
Wait a minute.

351
00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.240
Old man Fa Zhou
got a point now.

352
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.040
Mulan and Shang
are as different
as sun and rain.

353
00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.320
And when
the infatuation
wears off,

354
00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.720
their tree of life's
gonna wind up with
root rot.

355
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.840
(CHIRPS)

356
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.440
Oh, yeah,
sure she seems happy.

357
00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.080
That's the real
tragedy here.

358
00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.440
The girl don't even realize
how miserable she is.

359
00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.560
(CHIRPS)

360
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.960
That's why I
gotta nip this thing
in the bud.

361

(CHIRPING)

362
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.760
This is not about
my pedestal.

363
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.120
This is about Mulan
making the biggest
mistake of my...

364
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.720
Uh, I mean,
her life.

365
00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.800
(CHIRPING)

366
00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.440
Man, how could I
have been so selfish?

367
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.640
Mulan's a girl
worth fighting for.

368
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.360
And after all,
I am the girl's
guardian.

369
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.160
Cri-Kee,
I'm gonna break them up.

370
00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.920
(CHIRPS)

371
00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.920
Oh. So I guess that means
you're on board.

372
00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.200
Uh, Mulan,
could you smooth out
the ride a little bit?

373
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.040
Oh, I'm getting horsesick.

374
00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.640
Mushu.
What are you
doing here?

375
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.920
Hey, whither thou go,
I goest, girl.

376
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.560
Remember,
teamwork isn't about ego,
it's about we go.

(CHIRPS)
Yeah, yeah,

382
00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.600
You're lucky
I don't break out
the bug spray.

383
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.960
THE EMPEROR:
As we stand here,

384
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.160
Mongol forces
are moving closer
to our border.

385
00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.080
The threat of attack
is growing every day.

386
00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.960
As it is, our army is
hopelessly outnumbered.

387
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.040
Your Majesty,

388
00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.520
let me lead my forces
in a preemptive strike.

389
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.240
Each of my warriors
will fight
like 10 Mongols.

390
00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.480
No, General.

391
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.400
I plan to defeat this enemy
without the use of force.

392
00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.960
Instead, we will
forge a union so strong,

393
00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.640
the Mongol hordes
won't dare attack.

394
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.320
An alliance
with the kingdom
of Qui Gong.

395
00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.160
We will become united
through marriage.

396
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.800
You will escort
three princesses
to Qui Gong.

397
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.840
There, they will marry
Lord Chin's sons...

398
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:38.960
What?

399
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.440
And seal this
critical alliance.

400
00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.880
Yes, Your Majesty.

401
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.800
My advisors tell me
the charts are clear.

402
00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.080
If this wedding
does not take place
in three days,

403
00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.960
the alliance will crumble
and the Mongols
will destroy us.

404
00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.960
Mark my words,
General, three days.

405
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.640
Not a moment more,
Your Majesty.

406
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.480
I know that face, Fa Mulan.
What troubles you?

407
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.200
Your Majesty,
an arranged marriage?

408
00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.840
Rest assured, child,

409
00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.760
my daughters know
exactly what
they are doing.

410
00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.200
Your daughters?

411
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.680
They consider it an honor
to marry in
the cause of peace.

412
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.920
Your Majesty,
I, uh...

413
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.440
Apology accepted.

414
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.360
General, how many troops
do you estimate you will need

415
00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.920
to accomplish
this mission?

416
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.160
Three.
Three companies?

417
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.200
Three men.

418
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.240
You surprise me, General.

419
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.760
These are my children.

420
00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.760
This mission does
not call for force,
but finesse.

421
00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.000
We must become one
with the countryside.

422
00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.320
As Emperor,
I trust you.

423
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.560
As a father,

424
00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.760
I implore you
to choose your
three soldiers wisely.

425
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.200
I know just the men.
Fearless.

426
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.280
Loyal.
And disciplined.

427
00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.840
China's most honorable
and noble soldiers.

428
00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.240

But the Golden

432
00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.240
couldn't make
love matches
for you three.

433

get personalities.

434

to treat China's greatest...

What's her problem?

437
00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:24.160
All I asked for was a girl
who would worship
the dirt I walk on.

438
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.880
I simply asked for someone
who would cook for me

439
00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.600
morning,
noon and night.

440
00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.040

who likes to laugh.

441
00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.320
And thinks I'm a god.

442

specific enough.

What face?
That face.

This is my face,

another duty.

Oh, Mulan,
your only duty is
to the Emperor.

532
00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.640
But, Shang,
an arranged marriage?

533
00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.080
I know, but not everyone
can be as lucky as we are.

even talk to him.
