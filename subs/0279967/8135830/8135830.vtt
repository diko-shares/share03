00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:27.758
O Savior of China,

2
00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:34.398
you have ennobled the House of Fa.

3
00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.358
In gratitude, we honor you.

4
00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:45.518
All veneration to you, O mighty...

5
00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.558
Say it. Say my name.

6
00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:49.278
Mushu.

7
00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:52.678
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

8
00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:55.278
Hey, how you doing up there, man?
Thanks for the intro.

9
00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.718
And now I think I'd like
to visit my beloved pedestal.

10
00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:05.398
Let's get it over with.

11
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.759
Ceremonial robe of honor.

12
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.079
If Mulan could see me now.

13
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.639
Mulan saves China one time,
and now he thinks he's the emperor.

14
00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:36.880
I'm climbing a stairway to heaven.

15
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.280
Top floor.

16
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.959
Pedestals, perks and props.

17
00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:44.879
Ceremonial bath of honor.

18
00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:51.840
Yeah.
Y'all better take a deep breath now,

19
00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:57.000
because I ain't leaving my pedestal
for the next thousand years.

20
00:01:58.641 --> 00:02:00.920
Let the whirlpool begin.

21
00:02:04.681 --> 00:02:06.121
Oh, yeah.

22
00:03:10.003 --> 00:03:14.282
According to this chart,
I put the coins here.

23
00:03:16.082 --> 00:03:17.842
Relax, child.

24
00:03:17.923 --> 00:03:22.482
The spirits tell me Shang will arrive and
propose to Mulan before the sun sets.

25
00:03:22.843 --> 00:03:25.402
There's still time to get in on the pool.

26
00:03:26.283 --> 00:03:27.443
Mother.

27
00:03:27.523 --> 00:03:31.683
Gambling is like playing mah-jongg
with blank tiles.

28
00:03:32.083 --> 00:03:34.362
No one really wins.

29
00:03:39.043 --> 00:03:42.083
I'm enriched by your presence, my son.

30
00:03:43.324 --> 00:03:45.842
I think I'll go pray.

31
00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:52.123
Hello, Sha-Ron.

32
00:03:52.204 --> 00:03:55.643
- Is Fa Mulan here?
- Why, she's out in the field.

33
00:03:55.723 --> 00:03:58.883
Yeah, doing her chores.

34
00:04:00.044 --> 00:04:02.083
I'll go help her.

35
00:04:02.604 --> 00:04:03.883
Thank you.

36
00:04:06.964 --> 00:04:09.123
The children all love Mulan.

37
00:04:09.204 --> 00:04:10.723
And why not?

38
00:04:10.804 --> 00:04:13.524
She's strong, she's brave,
she's beautiful.

39
00:04:14.885 --> 00:04:17.924
She's a chip off the old block.

40
00:04:21.404 --> 00:04:38.564
Hi-ya!

41
00:04:39.925 --> 00:04:40.924
Hiya.

42
00:04:42.165 --> 00:04:44.484
It's okay, Little Brother.
What's going on here?

43
00:04:44.565 --> 00:04:46.644
We wanna be like you, Fa Mulan.

44
00:04:46.726 --> 00:04:48.724
Ya! Ya! Hi-ya!

45
00:04:50.885 --> 00:04:52.764
But I'm still learning myself.

46
00:04:52.845 --> 00:04:55.124
- Please?
- Teach us, Mulan.

47
00:04:55.206 --> 00:04:58.324
- Show us.
- Okay. I guess I can show a few moves.

48
00:04:58.405 --> 00:05:00.965
Mulan's gonna teach us
how to kick butt.

49
00:05:04.086 --> 00:05:06.885
Hold it. Calm down.

50
00:05:06.966 --> 00:05:08.964
That's lesson number two.

51
00:05:09.046 --> 00:05:12.645
The first and most important lesson
is to be gentle

52
00:05:12.726 --> 00:05:15.205
at the same time we're being tough.

53
00:05:15.286 --> 00:05:17.285
How can you be tough and gentle?

54
00:05:17.366 --> 00:05:19.685
Yeah, I wanna be tough.

55
00:05:19.846 --> 00:05:20.845
Yeah!

56
00:05:20.926 --> 00:05:23.765
I know it does sound a little funny.

57
00:05:23.926 --> 00:05:27.645
But the world is full of opposites,
and so are you.

58
00:05:27.966 --> 00:05:31.405
To be a good warrior,
you must bring it all into balance.

59
00:05:33.887 --> 00:05:35.765
Let's see if this helps.

60
00:05:35.846 --> 00:05:39.206
Earth, sky, day, night.

61
00:05:39.446 --> 00:05:41.245
Sound and silence.

62
00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:43.206
Dark and light.

63
00:05:43.286 --> 00:05:45.565
One aIone is not enough

64
00:05:46.166 --> 00:05:48.725
You need both together

65
00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:53.525
Winter, summer
Moon and Sun

66
00:05:55.287 --> 00:05:56.886
Lesson number one

67
00:06:00.207 --> 00:06:03.446
Like a rock
You must be hard

68
00:06:03.767 --> 00:06:07.326
Like an oak
You must stand firm

69
00:06:07.407 --> 00:06:08.727
Cut quick

70
00:06:08.807 --> 00:06:10.927
Like my blade

71
00:06:11.007 --> 00:06:12.486
Think fast

72
00:06:12.568 --> 00:06:15.246
Unafraid

73
00:06:16.447 --> 00:06:20.126
Like a rock
I must be hard

74
00:06:20.207 --> 00:06:23.606
Like an oak
I must stand firm

75
00:06:23.688 --> 00:06:25.206
Cut quick

76
00:06:25.288 --> 00:06:27.047
Like my blade

77
00:06:27.127 --> 00:06:28.806
Think fast

78
00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:31.007
Unafraid

79
00:06:31.647 --> 00:06:33.207
Okay, Mulan, I'm ready.

80
00:06:34.007 --> 00:06:35.727
But you're still out of balance.

81
00:06:35.808 --> 00:06:37.447
You're only halfway there.

82
00:06:37.528 --> 00:06:41.287
Like a cIoud
You are soft

83
00:06:41.368 --> 00:06:45.047
Like bamboo
You bend in the wind

84
00:06:45.128 --> 00:06:49.127
Creeping sIow
You're at peace because you know

85
00:06:49.888 --> 00:06:53.207
lt's okay to be afraid

86
00:06:54.488 --> 00:06:58.208
Like a cIoud
I am soft

87
00:06:58.288 --> 00:07:01.768
Like bamboo
I bend in the wind

88
00:07:01.848 --> 00:07:06.168
Creeping sIow
l'm at peace because l know

89
00:07:06.488 --> 00:07:10.168
lt's okay to be afraid

90
00:07:11.568 --> 00:07:14.128
- One aIone is not enough
- One aIone is not enough

91
00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:18.568
- You need both together
- You need both together

92
00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:24.608
Winter, summer
Moon and sun

93
00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:26.968
Lesson number one

94
00:07:28.489 --> 00:07:30.528
- Like a cIoud
- Like a rock

95
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.168
- I am soft
- I must be hard

96
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.769
- Like bamboo
- Like an oak

97
00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:35.529
- I bend in the wind
- I must stand firm

98
00:07:35.609 --> 00:07:36.808
You can fly

99
00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:40.008
- l'm at peace because l know
- Cut quick Iike my bIade

100
00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:41.849
- Think fast
- lt's okay to be afraid

101
00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:43.848
Unafraid

102
00:07:43.929 --> 00:07:46.649
- You have begun
- Lesson number one

103
00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:48.849
Lesson number one
Lesson number one

104
00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.929
Lesson number one

105
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:56.968
It's General Shang.

106
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.209
- General Shang.
- It's Shang.

107
00:07:59.289 --> 00:08:02.009
Look, it's General Shang.

108
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.769
Hello, little warriors.

109
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.650
- The new uniform suits you, General.
- The uniform. Yes.

110
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.770
- Now I just have to live up to it.
- Of course you will.

111
00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.089
- You're very brave.
- Right. Brave.

112
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:26.049
Yes, well, Mulan,
I haven't known you for very long,

113
00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:28.809
but I feel that doesn't matter so much
when a man is in...

114
00:08:31.291 --> 00:08:32.730
When a man is in...

115
00:08:35.691 --> 00:08:37.650
Is there someplace private we can talk?

116
00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:39.410
We can go to my house.

117
00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:44.410
Okay, everybody,
time to be like the river and flow home.

118
00:08:44.491 --> 00:08:46.090
- Okay.
- Oh, no.

119
00:08:46.171 --> 00:08:47.290
Bye, Shang.

120
00:08:47.371 --> 00:08:49.490
- Bye, Shang. Bye, Mulan.
- See you.

121
00:08:52.451 --> 00:08:54.210
Could you take care of this for me?

122
00:08:58.811 --> 00:09:00.610
You know,
you're never gonna get that back.

123
00:09:15.932 --> 00:09:17.771
She said yes.

124
00:09:19.372 --> 00:09:24.851
When one's heart is overfilled with joy,
some may spill from the eyes.

125
00:09:24.932 --> 00:09:26.931
You can say that again.

126
00:09:27.012 --> 00:09:28.891
I win the pot.

127
00:09:29.972 --> 00:09:33.451
Actually, you bet
he would propose before sundown.

128
00:09:33.532 --> 00:09:36.492
I bet he would propose before noon.

129
00:09:36.572 --> 00:09:39.051
But, you don't gamble.

130
00:09:39.132 --> 00:09:41.852
Betting against my mother
is not a gamble.

131
00:09:41.932 --> 00:09:43.291
It's an investment.

132
00:09:46.893 --> 00:09:49.171
What a happy, happy day.

133
00:09:49.253 --> 00:09:51.412
My little baby's getting married.

134
00:09:51.813 --> 00:09:54.252
- Mushu, someone will hear you.
- I can't help it.

135
00:09:54.333 --> 00:09:56.332
You know dragons are very emotional.

136
00:09:56.493 --> 00:10:00.292
It seems like just last month
you and I were saving China.

137
00:10:00.373 --> 00:10:03.012
- It was last month.
- How time flies.

138
00:10:03.093 --> 00:10:05.452
You know, baby,
this must be a magical moment for you.

139
00:10:05.533 --> 00:10:07.332
It's not every day I get engaged.

140
00:10:07.413 --> 00:10:09.293
No, I meant telling me you're engaged.

141
00:10:10.173 --> 00:10:13.012
After all, I'm the guy that gave you
and Pretty Boy the hookup.

142
00:10:13.093 --> 00:10:15.453
Am I a guardian or am I a guardian?

143
00:10:17.013 --> 00:10:19.013
You're more than that, Mushu.

144
00:10:19.093 --> 00:10:21.092
You're my most trusted friend.

145
00:10:21.774 --> 00:10:22.973
That did it.

146
00:10:23.694 --> 00:10:25.252
Are you crying again?

147
00:10:25.334 --> 00:10:27.412
No, I just got some exfoliating cream
in my eye.

148
00:10:27.494 --> 00:10:29.413
Of course I'm crying, girl.
What you think?

149
00:10:29.773 --> 00:10:32.212
Oh, Mulan. I'm just so happy for me.

150
00:10:32.653 --> 00:10:33.693
You?

151
00:10:34.654 --> 00:10:37.533
This wedding business
is a big status boost for me.

152
00:10:37.614 --> 00:10:39.332
When those ancestors
look up the career ladder,

153
00:10:39.414 --> 00:10:41.613
all they gonna see is my behind.

154
00:10:41.694 --> 00:10:44.853
So glad my getting married
is helping you out, Mushu.

155
00:10:45.014 --> 00:10:46.693
All right, I get you, Miss Missy.

156
00:10:46.774 --> 00:10:48.253
But, you know,
I'm thinking about you too.

157
00:10:48.334 --> 00:10:50.213
In fact, I'm gonna plan your wedding.

158
00:10:50.294 --> 00:10:52.894
First, I gotta work me up a theme.
You know, theme is everything.

159
00:10:52.974 --> 00:10:56.133
How about Rainbow of Memories?

160
00:10:56.774 --> 00:10:58.094
No, that's too junior prom.

161
00:10:58.174 --> 00:11:00.854
I've got it. The theme is Think Pink.

162
00:11:00.934 --> 00:11:03.373
You know, pink is the new red, girl.
It's simple, it says it.

163
00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:05.614
Now, watch my smoke.

164
00:11:05.694 --> 00:11:07.134
Cri-Kee, to the fabric store.

165
00:11:09.215 --> 00:11:10.373
Mulan?

166
00:11:10.455 --> 00:11:13.933
Seems your grandma invited someone
to help us celebrate the engagement.

167
00:11:14.015 --> 00:11:15.973
Really? Who?

168
00:11:16.735 --> 00:11:17.854
China.

169
00:11:17.935 --> 00:11:21.214
Congratulations!

170
00:11:22.975 --> 00:11:24.734
Isn't it wonderful?

171
00:11:24.815 --> 00:11:26.894
Sorry, it's sort of slapdash.

172
00:11:26.975 --> 00:11:28.574
It took us by surprise, you know?

173
00:11:29.815 --> 00:11:32.214
Make way for the happy couple.

174
00:11:35.255 --> 00:11:37.294
Now, this is a battlefield.

175
00:11:37.375 --> 00:11:39.054
What's our strategy, General?

176
00:11:39.135 --> 00:11:41.534
Divide and conquer.

177
00:11:43.575 --> 00:11:46.375
All right, all right, all right, dead people,
we've got work to do,

178
00:11:46.455 --> 00:11:48.334
so let's move with purpose.

179
00:11:49.055 --> 00:11:51.015
I've got an important announcement
to make.

180
00:11:51.095 --> 00:11:55.214
Hold on to your ectoplasm, now.
Mulan's getting married.

181
00:12:00.016 --> 00:12:02.975
All right, all right, all right,
simmer down. I know just how you feel.

182
00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:05.495
But time is wasting, people,
so let's move, move, move.

183
00:12:05.576 --> 00:12:07.375
The theme is pink.

184
00:12:07.456 --> 00:12:09.495
I wanna see pink flowers,
pink ribbons, pink bows.

185
00:12:09.576 --> 00:12:11.735
I'm not talking about salmon.
Don't show me no blush.

186
00:12:11.816 --> 00:12:14.496
I mean, pink
as a freshly slapped newborn's behind.

187
00:12:14.576 --> 00:12:17.255
- How about a pink slip?
- Excuse me?

188
00:12:17.336 --> 00:12:19.815
Don't nobody wanna see your drawers.

189
00:12:19.896 --> 00:12:22.095
Actually, she meant this.

190
00:12:23.336 --> 00:12:25.775
Hey, this looks like a for-real pink slip.

191
00:12:25.857 --> 00:12:28.616
You know, like a "you're fired" pink slip.

192
00:12:28.696 --> 00:12:30.615
- It is.
- Say what?

193
00:12:31.337 --> 00:12:33.216
The pink slip is for you.

194
00:12:33.537 --> 00:12:36.176
It is written, once a woman marries,

195
00:12:36.257 --> 00:12:39.936
her husband's ancestors
take over the duty of guardianship.

196
00:12:40.456 --> 00:12:44.296
Oh, no, your scroll must have a typo.
That can't be.

197
00:12:44.777 --> 00:12:48.176
- But it is. You're out of a job.
- Out of a pedestal.

198
00:12:48.257 --> 00:12:50.296
And out of our hair, fool.

199
00:12:51.497 --> 00:12:54.056
Oh, no, no, no. I ain't going out like this.

200
00:12:54.138 --> 00:12:56.976
It took me 500 years
to get this pedestal back,

201
00:12:57.057 --> 00:12:58.736
and I ain't about to give it up.

202
00:12:58.817 --> 00:13:01.616
Hear me, you lazy lounge lizard.

203
00:13:01.697 --> 00:13:05.497
The moment Fa Mulan is married,
you've got your old job back.

204
00:13:06.017 --> 00:13:07.776
Remember gong duty?

205
00:13:08.297 --> 00:13:10.737
Perhaps this will ring a bell.

206
00:13:18.577 --> 00:13:26.177
Mushu's on his way out

207
00:13:26.258 --> 00:13:29.137
Mushu's on his way out
Mushu's on his way out

208
00:13:29.218 --> 00:13:31.057
What am I gonna do?

209
00:13:32.098 --> 00:13:34.097
Mushu's on his way out

210
00:13:43.219 --> 00:13:46.537
- So tell me, will it be a big wedding?
- Absolutely.

211
00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:48.418
Oh, no. Absolutely not.

212
00:13:49.259 --> 00:13:51.617
- Children?
- As many as possible.

213
00:13:51.739 --> 00:13:53.537
Maybe one or two.

214
00:13:53.939 --> 00:13:55.737
- We'll think about it.
- Right away.

215
00:13:55.819 --> 00:13:57.657
- Blue. Mild.
- Pink. Spicy.

216
00:13:57.739 --> 00:13:59.058
- Yes.
- No.

217
00:13:59.139 --> 00:14:00.898
Oh, dear. Did you hear that?

218
00:14:00.979 --> 00:14:03.778
Not exactly a harmonious couple,
are they?

219
00:14:03.859 --> 00:14:05.098
What should we do?

220
00:14:05.179 --> 00:14:08.098
Perhaps we should give our gift
to the children now.

221
00:14:12.099 --> 00:14:15.459
General Shang, Fa Mulan.
Orders from His Majesty the Emperor.

222
00:14:15.539 --> 00:14:17.099
- Is there trouble?
- Yes, sir.

223
00:14:17.179 --> 00:14:19.058
Report to the Imperial Palace.

224
00:14:20.419 --> 00:14:21.698
We'll leave at once.

225
00:14:22.979 --> 00:14:25.658
This must be pretty important
for the Emperor to want both of us.

226
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.779
He knows a winning team
when he sees one.

227
00:14:28.539 --> 00:14:29.979
Since when are they the winning team?

228
00:14:30.059 --> 00:14:32.739
The ink ain't even dry on my pink slip
and I'm being replaced.

229
00:14:35.499 --> 00:14:37.899
Yeah, I know, you're right.

230
00:14:37.979 --> 00:14:40.019
How could I have been so selfish?

231
00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.339
Look at them.
Those two clearly got it going on.

232
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.779
Cri-Kee, I've made a decision.

233
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.019
I gotta kiss my pedestal goodbye,

234
00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.219
because my girl's happiness
comes first.

235
00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:53.979
Ba-ba. Ma-ma.

236
00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.579
We were just admiring the Mudan tree.

237
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.219
It's so lovely this year.

238
00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:01.140
The blossoms reach
for the sunlight above,

239
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:05.780
yet unseen,
the roots reach for the rainwater below.

240
00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.619
Sun and rain, so different.

241
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:14.420
Yet only by working together
do they create harmony and life.

242
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.940
I know, Ba-ba.
The lesson of yin and yang.

243
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.500
And to help you remember that lesson...

244
00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.980
Father, Mother. Your necklaces.

245
00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.580
Not ours.
Our great-great-grandparents.

246
00:15:27.661 --> 00:15:29.980
And now, yours.

247
00:15:31.261 --> 00:15:32.740
Thank you, sir.

248
00:15:33.381 --> 00:15:34.860
They're so beautiful.

249
00:15:35.141 --> 00:15:39.180
But you'll be surprised
how heavily they can weigh.

250
00:15:39.262 --> 00:15:42.460
To share the burden,
you must work together.

251
00:15:42.542 --> 00:15:45.141
Like the sun and rain.

252
00:15:46.502 --> 00:15:47.540
Wait a minute.

253
00:15:47.622 --> 00:15:49.980
Old man Fa Zhou got a point now.

254
00:15:50.062 --> 00:15:53.621
Mulan and Shang
are as different as sun and rain.

255
00:15:53.902 --> 00:15:55.821
And when the infatuation wears off,

256
00:15:55.901 --> 00:15:58.100
their tree of life's
gonna wind up with root rot.

257
00:15:59.102 --> 00:16:02.301
Yeah, sure she seems happy.
That's the real tragedy here.

258
00:16:02.382 --> 00:16:04.780
The girl don't even realize
how miserable she is.

259
00:16:05.621 --> 00:16:07.901
That's why I gotta nip this thing
in the bud.

260
00:16:09.782 --> 00:16:11.581
This is not about my pedestal.

261
00:16:11.662 --> 00:16:14.821
This is about Mulan
making the biggest mistake of my...

262
00:16:15.662 --> 00:16:17.382
I mean, her life.

263
00:16:18.422 --> 00:16:20.861
Man, how could I have been so selfish?

264
00:16:20.943 --> 00:16:22.981
Mulan's a girl worth fighting for.

265
00:16:23.062 --> 00:16:26.542
And after all, I am the girl's guardian.

266
00:16:26.622 --> 00:16:29.221
Cri-Kee, I'm gonna break them up.

267
00:16:32.583 --> 00:16:34.181
So I guess that means you're on board.

268
00:16:39.342 --> 00:16:41.742
Mulan, could you smooth out
the ride a little bit?

269
00:16:41.822 --> 00:16:43.502
I'm getting horsesick.

270
00:16:44.263 --> 00:16:45.982
Mushu. What are you doing here?

271
00:16:46.062 --> 00:16:48.182
Hey, whither thou go, I goest, girl.

272
00:16:48.262 --> 00:16:50.982
Remember, teamwork isn't about ego,
it's about we go.

273
00:16:51.623 --> 00:16:53.822
Cri-Kee. What are you doing here?

274
00:16:56.103 --> 00:16:58.182
Protect Mulan from me?
I'm her guardian.

275
00:16:58.583 --> 00:17:00.382
Yeah, yeah, her lucky cricket.

276
00:17:00.463 --> 00:17:02.262
You're lucky
I don't break out the bug spray.

277
00:17:12.744 --> 00:17:14.103
As we stand here,

278
00:17:14.183 --> 00:17:17.183
Mongol forces
are moving closer to our border.

279
00:17:17.264 --> 00:17:19.983
The threat of attack
is growing every day.

280
00:17:20.064 --> 00:17:23.703
As it is,
our army is hopelessly outnumbered.

281
00:17:23.783 --> 00:17:24.742
Your Majesty,

282
00:17:24.824 --> 00:17:27.103
let me lead my forces
in a preemptive strike.

283
00:17:27.184 --> 00:17:29.743
Each of my warriors
will fight like 10 Mongols.

284
00:17:29.823 --> 00:17:30.903
No, General.

285
00:17:30.984 --> 00:17:34.663
I plan to defeat this enemy
without the use of force.

286
00:17:34.984 --> 00:17:40.663
Instead, we will forge a union so strong,
the Mongol hordes won't dare attack.

287
00:17:41.104 --> 00:17:44.223
An alliance
with the kingdom of Qui Gong.

288
00:17:44.424 --> 00:17:47.904
We will become united
through marriage.

289
00:17:48.104 --> 00:17:51.383
You will escort three princesses
to Qui Gong.

290
00:17:51.465 --> 00:17:54.263
There, they will marry
Lord Chin's sons...

291
00:17:54.345 --> 00:17:56.784
- What?
- And seal this critical alliance.

292
00:17:56.864 --> 00:17:58.144
Yes, Your Majesty.

293
00:17:58.224 --> 00:18:00.943
My advisors tell me the charts are clear.

294
00:18:01.025 --> 00:18:04.103
If this wedding does not take place
in three days,

295
00:18:04.185 --> 00:18:06.864
the alliance will crumble
and the Mongols will destroy us.

296
00:18:07.625 --> 00:18:10.704
Mark my words, General, three days.

297
00:18:10.785 --> 00:18:12.304
Not a moment more, Your Majesty.

298
00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:16.944
I know that face, Fa Mulan.
What troubles you?

299
00:18:17.025 --> 00:18:19.544
Your Majesty, an arranged marriage?

300
00:18:22.345 --> 00:18:24.024
Rest assured, child,

301
00:18:24.106 --> 00:18:27.785
my daughters know
exactly what they are doing.

302
00:18:27.865 --> 00:18:29.145
Your daughters?

303
00:18:29.225 --> 00:18:32.504
They consider it an honor
to marry in the cause of peace.

304
00:18:32.586 --> 00:18:35.585
Your Majesty, I...

305
00:18:35.665 --> 00:18:38.024
Apology accepted.

306
00:18:38.106 --> 00:18:40.825
General, how many troops
do you estimate you will need

307
00:18:40.906 --> 00:18:42.345
to accomplish this mission?

308
00:18:42.906 --> 00:18:44.465
- Three.
- Three companies?

309
00:18:44.546 --> 00:18:47.425
- Three men.
- You surprise me, General.

310
00:18:47.506 --> 00:18:48.865
These are my children.

311
00:18:48.945 --> 00:18:51.745
This mission does not call for force,
but finesse.

312
00:18:51.825 --> 00:18:53.905
We must become one
with the countryside.

313
00:18:53.986 --> 00:18:56.105
As Emperor, I trust you.

314
00:18:56.186 --> 00:18:57.306
As a father,

315
00:18:57.386 --> 00:19:01.345
I implore you
to choose your three soldiers wisely.

316
00:19:01.426 --> 00:19:03.665
I know just the men. Fearless.

317
00:19:03.786 --> 00:19:05.666
- Loyal.
- And disciplined.

318
00:19:05.746 --> 00:19:08.985
China's most honorable
and noble soldiers.

319
00:19:09.747 --> 00:19:11.386
And stay out!

320
00:19:13.347 --> 00:19:15.825
I've found wives for hundreds of men.

321
00:19:15.907 --> 00:19:18.266
But the Golden Dragon of Unity himself

322
00:19:18.346 --> 00:19:20.986
couldn't make love matches
for you three.

323
00:19:21.267 --> 00:19:24.706
Come back when you get personalities.

324
00:19:25.067 --> 00:19:28.266
Well, that's a fine way
to treat China's greatest...

325
00:19:29.707 --> 00:19:31.146
Heroes.

326
00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:32.586
What's her problem?

327
00:19:32.667 --> 00:19:36.226
All I asked for was a girl
who would worship the dirt I walk on.

328
00:19:36.307 --> 00:19:38.866
I simply asked for someone
who would cook for me

329
00:19:38.947 --> 00:19:40.507
morning, noon and night.

330
00:19:40.587 --> 00:19:42.827
And I just wanted a girl
who likes to laugh.

331
00:19:42.907 --> 00:19:45.027
And thinks I'm a god.

332
00:19:45.107 --> 00:19:47.266
Perhaps we weren't specific enough.

333
00:19:47.348 --> 00:19:49.667
Forget that dragon lady.

334
00:19:49.747 --> 00:19:52.987
The only ones
who can find girls worthy of us is us.

335
00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:54.067
Yeah.

336
00:19:54.147 --> 00:19:58.346
Well, l don't need her
To be all smug and snooty

337
00:19:58.588 --> 00:20:02.107
l got a plaque right here
That says l kicked Hun booty

338
00:20:03.147 --> 00:20:05.467
We have everything
We dreamed we'd find

339
00:20:05.548 --> 00:20:07.387
When we came back from war

340
00:20:07.468 --> 00:20:09.147
Yeah, everything but

341
00:20:11.228 --> 00:20:14.027
A girl worth fighting for

342
00:20:14.188 --> 00:20:15.507
Hey, suck in your gut.

343
00:20:15.588 --> 00:20:17.667
There's a girl worth fighting for

344
00:20:17.748 --> 00:20:20.307
And I think she wants us to come over.

345
00:20:20.628 --> 00:20:23.387
My girl will laugh at all my jokes

346
00:20:23.468 --> 00:20:24.987
But tell it to me straight

347
00:20:25.069 --> 00:20:27.347
She'II rub my head when I get sick

348
00:20:27.428 --> 00:20:30.027
And let me pick off of her plate

349
00:20:30.308 --> 00:20:34.467
lf Ling can find a girl
Who likes his chopstick nose trick

350
00:20:34.548 --> 00:20:37.307
Oh, he reaIIy better just propose quick

351
00:20:39.268 --> 00:20:43.428
Well, l have to say
Based on today l'm cranky

352
00:20:43.509 --> 00:20:45.588
l'll just spend my life with you two

353
00:20:45.668 --> 00:20:48.068
Pass the hanky

354
00:20:48.148 --> 00:20:50.268
And there's no one there
To steal my chair

355
00:20:50.349 --> 00:20:52.828
And twirI around the fIoor

356
00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:56.508
Wish that I had
A girl worth fighting for

357
00:20:57.229 --> 00:20:59.668
I wouId be true
To a girl worth fighting

358
00:20:59.749 --> 00:21:01.748
I'd make fondue
For a girl worth fighting

359
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.348
l'd even kiss you
For a girl worth fighting

360
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.188
For

361
00:21:08.589 --> 00:21:11.028
Mulan. General Shang.

362
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:14.788
If you three aren't too busy
disturbing the peace,

363
00:21:14.869 --> 00:21:16.948
I need you to join Mulan and me
on a mission.

364
00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:19.028
- To save China?
- Naturally.

365
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:23.989
I'll be leaving behind
a few broken hearts, but count me in.

366
00:21:24.069 --> 00:21:27.109
- Sign me up.
- When do we start, General?

367
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:28.429
Tonight.

368
00:22:39.911 --> 00:22:41.590
We're about to depart,
Your Highnesses.

369
00:22:41.672 --> 00:22:44.631
You have my word
we will arrive swiftly and safely.

370
00:22:44.711 --> 00:22:46.831
My sisters and I thank you,
General Shang.

371
00:22:48.072 --> 00:22:50.431
Permit me to introduce Fa Mulan.

372
00:22:50.512 --> 00:22:53.111
It is a privilege
to meet the hero of China.

373
00:22:53.192 --> 00:22:55.351
I leave you in her capable hands.

374
00:22:55.432 --> 00:22:56.511
Stand ready.

375
00:22:56.592 --> 00:23:00.071
- You might need these. It's a little chilly.
- Thank you, Fa Mulan.

376
00:23:00.152 --> 00:23:01.591
You're welcome, Your Highness.

377
00:23:01.672 --> 00:23:05.551
- So, you're getting married?
- Oh, yes.

378
00:23:06.192 --> 00:23:08.991
- To princes in Qui Gong.
- That's right.

379
00:23:09.072 --> 00:23:11.272
Well, they must be handsome.

380
00:23:11.352 --> 00:23:13.592
We don't know. We've never met them.

381
00:23:13.672 --> 00:23:14.992
Really?

382
00:23:15.072 --> 00:23:18.392
So you have no idea
what they're like at all.

383
00:23:18.472 --> 00:23:20.111
It's all right, Fa Mulan.

384
00:23:20.193 --> 00:23:22.472
It's our honor to serve the Emperor.

385
00:23:22.552 --> 00:23:23.912
And the Middle Kingdom.

386
00:23:23.993 --> 00:23:26.032
The whole thing is so exciting.

387
00:23:26.113 --> 00:23:28.191
We're very happy, really.

388
00:23:28.913 --> 00:23:31.992
Well, I'm glad to hear that. I'm not sure
I could go through with some...

389
00:23:32.073 --> 00:23:33.872
Mulan, prepare to move out.

390
00:23:34.833 --> 00:23:36.232
Time to get going.

391
00:23:40.673 --> 00:23:41.872
Move out.

392
00:23:53.313 --> 00:23:56.192
If we get to the Honshu pass
by midday tomorrow...

393
00:23:56.274 --> 00:23:58.553
We'll have just enough time
to make it to Qui Gong.

394
00:23:58.633 --> 00:24:00.913
Yeah, just enough time to stop Mulan

395
00:24:00.993 --> 00:24:02.433
from making the biggest mistake
of my...

396
00:24:02.513 --> 00:24:04.753
I mean, her life.

397
00:24:32.034 --> 00:24:33.473
What's the face?

398
00:24:33.555 --> 00:24:35.354
- What face?
- That face.

399
00:24:35.434 --> 00:24:38.273
There's no face.
This is my face, that's all.

400
00:24:38.355 --> 00:24:41.074
You know I know you
better than that, Mulan.

401
00:24:41.314 --> 00:24:42.434
What's wrong?

402
00:24:42.995 --> 00:24:46.314
- I realize our duty is to the mission...
- But...

403
00:24:46.394 --> 00:24:49.634
But I have another duty. To my heart.

404
00:24:49.715 --> 00:24:52.714
Mulan, your only duty is to the Emperor.

405
00:24:52.794 --> 00:24:55.114
But, Shang, an arranged marriage?

406
00:24:55.195 --> 00:24:58.394
I know, but not everyone
can be as lucky as we are.

407
00:24:58.475 --> 00:25:00.914
In an ideal world,
everyone would marry for love.

408
00:25:01.835 --> 00:25:03.154
But the world isn't perfect.

409
00:25:04.195 --> 00:25:06.154
I'm just glad my world is.

410
00:25:10.876 --> 00:25:12.915
"My world." Talk about selfish.

411
00:25:12.995 --> 00:25:15.675
You know, you don't hear me bragging
about how it's my world,

412
00:25:15.755 --> 00:25:17.155
even though it pretty much is.

413
00:25:17.235 --> 00:25:18.234
I'm telling you, Cri-Kee,

414
00:25:18.315 --> 00:25:21.234
the sooner I bust them apart,
the better things will be for Mulan.

415
00:25:22.076 --> 00:25:26.394
And so I said,
you just broke my best set of China.

416
00:25:27.876 --> 00:25:29.274
China. Get it?

417
00:25:29.356 --> 00:25:32.075
Did you see the way she looked at me?

418
00:25:32.155 --> 00:25:33.435
You mean with disgust?

419
00:25:34.796 --> 00:25:36.075
No.

420
00:25:36.156 --> 00:25:40.595
Our eyes met
and we shared a cosmic moment.

421
00:25:41.396 --> 00:25:44.275
Just like when I look
at potted pig's knuckles.

422
00:25:45.317 --> 00:25:47.115
It's love, I tell you.

423
00:25:47.196 --> 00:25:48.835
Love.

424
00:25:48.916 --> 00:25:50.516
Love, shmove.

425
00:25:50.596 --> 00:25:52.836
It doesn't matter, we're on a mission.

426
00:25:52.916 --> 00:25:55.275
No fraternizing with the princesses.

427
00:25:55.356 --> 00:25:58.316
Engaged-to-be-married princesses.

428
00:25:58.636 --> 00:26:00.076
Oh, yeah.

429
00:26:09.797 --> 00:26:13.035
China is so big. Isn't it beautiful, Mei?

430
00:26:13.716 --> 00:26:14.836
Mei?

431
00:26:15.677 --> 00:26:17.996
Yes, beautiful.

432
00:26:18.357 --> 00:26:20.676
Did you see the way he looked at me?

433
00:26:20.757 --> 00:26:22.516
Who, the gorilla with the bad eye?

434
00:26:22.597 --> 00:26:26.516
Gorilla?
He's more like a big cuddly panda bear.

435
00:26:26.598 --> 00:26:30.036
- But you didn't even talk to him.
- A true romantic can tell.

436
00:26:30.477 --> 00:26:33.956
He may be coarse on the outside,
but on the inside...

437
00:26:34.037 --> 00:26:36.676
- He's gross?
- I mean, under that.

438
00:26:36.957 --> 00:26:38.316
He smells?

439
00:26:38.638 --> 00:26:40.717
I can see past my nose.

440
00:26:40.797 --> 00:26:46.837
Deep down, deep, deep down,
way down, there's something.

441
00:26:47.118 --> 00:26:49.916
Ting Ting, I think she's in love.

442
00:26:49.998 --> 00:26:51.957
Oh, no. There will be none of that.

443
00:26:52.038 --> 00:26:54.917
Remember, Mei,
you are to be married in three days.

444
00:26:54.997 --> 00:26:56.437
You gave your solemn oath.

445
00:26:58.518 --> 00:26:59.797
You're right.

446
00:27:06.758 --> 00:27:08.917
We're stopping to water the horses,
Your Highnesses.

447
00:27:08.998 --> 00:27:10.557
Maybe you'd like to stretch your legs?

448
00:27:10.638 --> 00:27:13.117
Are the guard fellows out there?

449
00:27:13.398 --> 00:27:15.558
Yes. You're perfectly safe.

450
00:27:15.799 --> 00:27:18.077
I think a leg stretch would be very nice.

451
00:27:28.959 --> 00:27:31.158
Thank you for helping me
with my slipper.

452
00:27:32.158 --> 00:27:33.478
May I know your name?

453
00:27:34.119 --> 00:27:37.318
Now. Dow. Cow. Bao?

454
00:27:37.399 --> 00:27:38.918
No, you must eat.

455
00:27:38.999 --> 00:27:41.998
It must be exhausting
guarding us day and night.

456
00:27:42.079 --> 00:27:46.158
Oh, no.
Well, yes, but I'm strong, and marching.

457
00:27:46.239 --> 00:27:50.198
Yes, I suppose all that training
does make it second nature.

458
00:27:50.919 --> 00:27:54.759
But I think, you, a princess, with royal...

459
00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:56.358
I could never...

460
00:27:56.439 --> 00:27:58.319
But it is our duty, and our honor.

461
00:27:58.399 --> 00:28:00.438
Although it can be a burden.

462
00:28:01.519 --> 00:28:03.079
I've said too much.

463
00:28:03.159 --> 00:28:05.439
You are very easy to talk to, Yao.

464
00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.319
Permit me to echo your praise,
Your Highness.

465
00:28:08.399 --> 00:28:12.679
I find your presence engaging
and your conversation sparkling.

466
00:28:12.759 --> 00:28:14.119
Thank you.

467
00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.599
Well, hello there. I am Ling.

468
00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.320
I am Princess Ting Ting.

469
00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:40.000
Well, if you ever need me,
just give me a ting-a-ling.

470
00:28:42.041 --> 00:28:43.399
Come on, Your Highness.

471
00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.800
You don't wanna let your guard down.

472
00:28:45.881 --> 00:28:48.039
Get it? Guard? Down?

473
00:28:48.121 --> 00:28:49.399
Thank you.

474
00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:53.040
You know,
I've got some blue blood myself.

475
00:28:53.121 --> 00:28:54.999
Many have called me a royal pain.

476
00:28:55.641 --> 00:28:56.880
Thank you.

477
00:28:57.281 --> 00:28:59.080
You've been a great crowd.

478
00:29:02.001 --> 00:29:04.880
Ting Ting, look, isn't this fruit lovely?

479
00:29:04.961 --> 00:29:08.160
Chien-Po got it for me. He's so sweet.

480
00:29:08.241 --> 00:29:10.440
Just get your pomegranates
in the carriage.

481
00:29:22.441 --> 00:29:24.161
Fa Mulan?

482
00:29:24.241 --> 00:29:26.840
Your Highness. Is anything wrong?

483
00:29:26.922 --> 00:29:29.601
No, no, not at all.

484
00:29:29.922 --> 00:29:31.920
Are you sure?

485
00:29:33.482 --> 00:29:36.280
I just wanted to compliment you.

486
00:29:36.362 --> 00:29:39.481
You were so brave
to take your father's place in the army.

487
00:29:40.402 --> 00:29:42.121
Well, thank you.

488
00:29:42.402 --> 00:29:44.361
Your duty was to stay home,

489
00:29:44.442 --> 00:29:47.401
but your heart told you
to break the rules.

490
00:29:47.482 --> 00:29:50.041
How did you decide
between duty and heart?

491
00:29:52.802 --> 00:29:55.121
Well, it wasn't easy.

492
00:29:55.202 --> 00:29:59.361
But, by following my feelings,
I wound up doing the right thing.

493
00:29:59.443 --> 00:30:02.682
I guess I learned
that my duty is to my heart.

494
00:30:03.362 --> 00:30:06.522
"My duty is to my heart."

495
00:30:06.722 --> 00:30:10.522
Yes, that makes sense.
That's marvelous.

496
00:30:10.602 --> 00:30:12.921
Thank you, Fa Mulan. Thank you.

497
00:30:13.283 --> 00:30:16.321
You're welcome, I guess.

498
00:30:16.482 --> 00:30:18.521
Let's get back on the road.

499
00:30:21.203 --> 00:30:24.482
That's my cue
to put Operation Shang into action.

500
00:30:24.563 --> 00:30:29.242
Pretty Boy's gonna look so bad,
it will send Mulan running for the hills.

501
00:30:30.923 --> 00:30:33.922
This is gonna be delicious.

502
00:30:40.564 --> 00:30:42.002
Watch this.

503
00:30:43.564 --> 00:30:45.122
Hey. What?

504
00:30:49.644 --> 00:30:50.882
Hey.

505
00:30:50.964 --> 00:30:52.723
Good catch, Shang.

506
00:31:16.245 --> 00:31:17.604
Shang?

507
00:31:39.485 --> 00:31:40.964
Hey.

508
00:31:42.365 --> 00:31:43.524
Tasty.

509
00:31:52.965 --> 00:31:55.244
I try and I try.

510
00:31:55.326 --> 00:31:58.284
I put my heart and soul
into busting them up.

511
00:31:58.365 --> 00:32:00.164
And what do I have to show for it?

512
00:32:02.125 --> 00:32:04.365
A cricket laughs in my face.

513
00:32:05.085 --> 00:32:07.805
I just can't do it anymore.

514
00:32:08.886 --> 00:32:13.604
Great ancestors,
I throw myself at your mercy.

515
00:32:13.686 --> 00:32:16.125
My pedestal is all but a distant memory.

516
00:32:16.726 --> 00:32:18.605
Great Spirits, take me now.

517
00:32:29.246 --> 00:32:30.285
Hold on, ladies.

518
00:32:30.366 --> 00:32:33.245
Help! We'll save you.

519
00:32:33.327 --> 00:32:35.246
Look out, a cliff!

520
00:32:35.326 --> 00:32:36.485
They're headed for the cliff.

521
00:32:36.566 --> 00:32:38.045
Come on.

522
00:32:41.086 --> 00:32:43.326
- Time to go, ladies.
- Ting Ting, over here.

523
00:32:43.406 --> 00:32:45.086
Go.

524
00:32:45.166 --> 00:32:46.766
- You're next.
- No, no, no.

525
00:32:46.847 --> 00:32:48.246
- Alley-oop.
- Take my arm.

526
00:32:49.607 --> 00:32:51.205
- Ling.
- Ting Ting's stuck.

527
00:32:52.806 --> 00:32:54.366
Mulan, the rope.

528
00:33:01.446 --> 00:33:02.886
Hang on.

529
00:33:17.567 --> 00:33:21.327
- Is everyone all right?
- Mei, I'll save you.

530
00:33:21.407 --> 00:33:23.446
I saved the food.

531
00:33:23.527 --> 00:33:25.567
And I saved you.

532
00:33:26.607 --> 00:33:27.806
Mulan.

533
00:33:30.328 --> 00:33:33.087
- What happened?
- I don't know, I wasn't near the carriage.

534
00:33:33.167 --> 00:33:35.367
Yao, Ling. Save the supplies.

535
00:33:35.448 --> 00:33:38.727
Keep paddling.
Look how great you're doing.

536
00:33:38.808 --> 00:33:41.407
- Who's the big boy?
- Thank you.

537
00:33:43.888 --> 00:33:45.167
My fault?

538
00:33:46.728 --> 00:33:48.087
This wasn't my plan.

539
00:33:48.168 --> 00:33:52.607
Wagon's busted, cold and miserable,
everything's ruined.

540
00:33:53.208 --> 00:33:54.447
Or maybe not.

541
00:33:54.528 --> 00:33:57.368
Old Shang's steaming
like a fresh pork bun.

542
00:33:58.688 --> 00:34:01.807
I bet he and Mulan
are two nasty words away

543
00:34:01.889 --> 00:34:03.847
from an all-out feud.

544
00:34:03.928 --> 00:34:07.727
Oh, Cri-Kee,
things are brightening up after all.

545
00:34:21.688 --> 00:34:25.248
- I've seen happier princesses.
- That's the least of our problems.

546
00:34:26.729 --> 00:34:28.928
There's a mountain pass
between here and Qui Gong.

547
00:34:29.729 --> 00:34:32.488
It takes us through bandit country,
but it's the only way.

548
00:34:32.569 --> 00:34:35.008
Why not just follow the river?

549
00:34:35.089 --> 00:34:38.728
- Because the river is not on the map.
- It's bound to go past a town.

550
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.849
And where there's a town,
there's a road.

551
00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:42.489
There's no town on the map.

552
00:34:42.569 --> 00:34:46.248
Well, then maybe we should
just forget the map and wing it.

553
00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:48.809
We can't "wing it." We need a new plan.

554
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:51.249
We have three days.
What if we get lost?

555
00:34:51.329 --> 00:34:53.808
Then we pull over and ask directions.

556
00:34:53.890 --> 00:34:57.409
We don't need to pull over
and ask directions. We have a map.

557
00:34:57.489 --> 00:34:59.489
What is it with men
and asking directions?

558
00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:01.369
What is it with women and maps?

559
00:35:01.449 --> 00:35:03.089
You're saying women can't read maps?

560
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:05.049
I'm saying that
women will ask directions,

561
00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:06.369
but they won't follow directions.

562
00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:08.049
Men follow directions,
so they don't need...

563
00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:09.849
General, I...

564
00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:13.569
Am I interrupting?

565
00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:16.409
- What is it, Yao?
- Scout report.

566
00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:19.410
I've found a village
and a path to it through the forest.

567
00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:21.529
A forest path?

568
00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:23.729
Great. Show us.

569
00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:26.530
See?
If it were a snake, it would have bit you.

570
00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:29.250
There's bound to be a road down there
that will lead us to Qui Gong.

571
00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:31.649
- Good work, Yao.
- Thank you, sir.

572
00:35:38.331 --> 00:35:39.970
Shang, I'm sorry.

573
00:35:40.051 --> 00:35:41.930
You're in charge of the mission.

574
00:35:42.011 --> 00:35:43.689
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

575
00:35:43.771 --> 00:35:45.930
A good leader is open to new ideas.

576
00:35:46.011 --> 00:35:47.250
Forgive me?

577
00:35:47.331 --> 00:35:48.930
There's nothing to forgive.

578
00:35:58.691 --> 00:36:01.771
I'd better go.
I've got the first watch, General.

579
00:36:01.851 --> 00:36:03.050
But...

580
00:36:07.092 --> 00:36:08.810
Are you bugging? Look at her go.

581
00:36:08.892 --> 00:36:10.330
She can't wait to get away from him.

582
00:36:12.012 --> 00:36:15.250
That's no smile, that's a mask of pain.

583
00:36:16.771 --> 00:36:21.291
Yeah, well, that was just phase one
of my new 18-phase master plan.

584
00:36:21.372 --> 00:36:24.371
Now, just watch phase two
when I get up close

585
00:36:25.132 --> 00:36:27.211
and personal.

586
00:36:41.732 --> 00:36:45.331
Excuse me, Your Highness,
I found your fan.

587
00:36:45.412 --> 00:36:48.011
It just needed a little drying out.

588
00:36:48.813 --> 00:36:50.292
Thank you, Ling.

589
00:36:50.372 --> 00:36:54.611
Normally,
I would say I'm your biggest fan,

590
00:36:54.693 --> 00:36:58.051
but, I'll just go away now.

591
00:36:58.253 --> 00:36:59.531
Again.

592
00:37:00.932 --> 00:37:02.052
Sorry.

593
00:37:03.053 --> 00:37:04.572
I'll replace that.

594
00:37:06.493 --> 00:37:09.252
Of course she doesn't like you.
You're just such a ding-a-ling.

595
00:37:10.973 --> 00:37:12.772
He likes you.

596
00:37:12.853 --> 00:37:14.692
It would seem so.

597
00:37:14.773 --> 00:37:16.933
And you like him.

598
00:37:17.253 --> 00:37:21.892
Well,
I appreciate that he's a good soldier.

599
00:37:23.413 --> 00:37:25.052
How can you do that?

600
00:37:25.134 --> 00:37:27.012
How can you look right at someone,

601
00:37:27.094 --> 00:37:29.892
realize you share a special connection,
and then just...

602
00:37:29.974 --> 00:37:32.533
I know where my duty lies, Mei.

603
00:37:32.613 --> 00:37:34.053
Do you?

604
00:37:50.734 --> 00:37:54.934
"And so, my dear father,
I cannot complete this mission.

605
00:37:55.014 --> 00:37:59.613
"I have come to realize
that my duty is to my heart."

606
00:37:59.974 --> 00:38:01.733
What are you doing?

607
00:38:03.654 --> 00:38:07.013
- She's running away.
- Mei, what are you thinking?

608
00:38:07.614 --> 00:38:09.253
I can't complete this mission.

609
00:38:09.575 --> 00:38:10.773
I know that now.

610
00:38:10.854 --> 00:38:13.294
Why, because
Yao has given you his heart?

611
00:38:13.374 --> 00:38:15.734
No, it's not about his heart.

612
00:38:16.135 --> 00:38:17.654
It's about mine.

613
00:38:17.734 --> 00:38:19.773
Mei, we've discussed this.

614
00:38:20.215 --> 00:38:23.494
A princess must make every sacrifice
for her country.

615
00:38:23.855 --> 00:38:25.454
It's our duty.

616
00:38:27.615 --> 00:38:30.254
The life of a princess

617
00:38:31.615 --> 00:38:34.694
From her birth is weII-defined

618
00:38:35.975 --> 00:38:39.334
She must humbIy serve her country

619
00:38:40.215 --> 00:38:43.574
Play the part she's been assigned

620
00:38:44.416 --> 00:38:48.454
She guards the hopes of her peopIe

621
00:38:48.775 --> 00:38:52.655
Weak and mighty, rich and poor

622
00:38:53.576 --> 00:38:55.574
Who couId ever ask for more?

623
00:38:55.656 --> 00:38:59.895
Who couId ever ask for

624
00:38:59.975 --> 00:39:01.815
More?

625
00:39:03.416 --> 00:39:06.055
l wanna be like other girls

626
00:39:06.135 --> 00:39:08.895
CIimb up a tree Iike other girIs can

627
00:39:08.976 --> 00:39:15.535
Just to be free like other girls get to be

628
00:39:16.296 --> 00:39:17.775
Mei. Su.

629
00:39:17.856 --> 00:39:19.255
To sIouch when I sit

630
00:39:19.336 --> 00:39:20.496
To eat a whoIe cake

631
00:39:20.576 --> 00:39:21.975
Feel the sun on my feet

632
00:39:22.056 --> 00:39:23.455
- Get dirty
- Act silly

633
00:39:23.536 --> 00:39:25.655
Be anything l want to be

634
00:39:25.736 --> 00:39:28.416
- Dance around
- ln my underwear

635
00:39:29.056 --> 00:39:30.415
To run really fast

636
00:39:30.497 --> 00:39:31.815
To get rid of this fan

637
00:39:31.897 --> 00:39:33.816
- To eat a whoIe cake
- Get crazy

638
00:39:33.897 --> 00:39:35.256
- With frosting
- No escorts

639
00:39:35.336 --> 00:39:36.575
- No manners
- No nursemaids

640
00:39:36.657 --> 00:39:39.296
No worries, no hands folded perfect

641
00:39:39.377 --> 00:39:41.456
Like holding a lily

642
00:39:41.536 --> 00:39:43.616
No pinchy shoes?

643
00:39:45.257 --> 00:39:47.896
l wanna be like other girls

644
00:39:47.977 --> 00:39:50.856
Scrape up my knee Iike other girIs can

645
00:39:50.937 --> 00:39:55.776
Just to be free
Like other girls

646
00:39:55.857 --> 00:39:59.177
Get to be

647
00:39:59.937 --> 00:40:01.296
To speak for myself

648
00:40:01.378 --> 00:40:02.496
To sing way off key

649
00:40:02.577 --> 00:40:03.896
Marry someone l've met

650
00:40:03.978 --> 00:40:05.416
Who Ioves me for me

651
00:40:05.498 --> 00:40:08.097
No escorts, no manners
No nursemaids, no worries

652
00:40:08.177 --> 00:40:10.096
No hands folded perfect

653
00:40:10.177 --> 00:40:12.256
Like holding a lily

654
00:40:12.338 --> 00:40:16.057
No pinchy shoes

655
00:40:16.138 --> 00:40:18.696

656
00:40:18.858 --> 00:40:21.617

Just to be free like other girls

Get to be

659
00:40:46.298 --> 00:40:48.577
She defied you.

660
00:40:48.659 --> 00:40:50.937
She insulted you.

661
00:40:51.019 --> 00:40:53.498
- Man, she laughed at your map.
- My map.

662
00:40:53.579 --> 00:40:55.577
And if she's laughing to your face,

663
00:40:55.659 --> 00:40:58.818
imagine what she's saying
behind your back.

664
00:40:58.898 --> 00:41:00.618
Back.

665
00:41:01.139 --> 00:41:02.338
She's a loose cannon.

666
00:41:02.418 --> 00:41:04.617
- She's out of control.
- She's out of control.

667
00:41:04.699 --> 00:41:06.698
I mean, who's in charge here? You?

668
00:41:06.779 --> 00:41:09.818
- I'm in charge, I'm in charge.
- Or Mulan? Mulan.

669
00:41:10.098 --> 00:41:12.058
- Mulan.
- Mulan.

670
00:41:12.139 --> 00:41:13.658
Mulan!

671
00:41:20.339 --> 00:41:22.419
General Shang? That's not it.

672
00:41:22.499 --> 00:41:23.818
General Shang?

673
00:41:23.899 --> 00:41:25.579
Hello, it's me, Mulan.

674
00:41:25.659 --> 00:41:27.178
General Shang.

675
00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:30.939
Shang, Shang, Shang.

676
00:41:31.019 --> 00:41:32.019
I got it.

677
00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:36.699
General Shang?

678
00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:39.979
General Hardhead,
that's what they should call him.

679
00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:43.659
- Everything's got to have a strategy.
- Mulan?

680
00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:46.458
The man won't brush his teeth
without a backup plan.

681
00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.579
- What?
- I blame myself.

682
00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:50.459
I fell for those broad shoulders.

683
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:53.139
I didn't realize there wasn't much
sitting on top of them.

684
00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:57.619
Except for that garlic breath.

685
00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:00.420
That boy can peel paint.

686
00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:05.259
That's enough. Where is she?

687
00:42:08.501 --> 00:42:10.059
I am good.

688
00:42:10.141 --> 00:42:12.379
- Mulan.
- Why, hello, general.

689
00:42:12.461 --> 00:42:13.940
Out on night maneuvers?

690
00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:16.140
General Hardhead? Brushing my teeth?

691
00:42:17.141 --> 00:42:21.220
- Is something wrong?
- I heard you, Mulan. Every word.

692
00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:23.780
Every word of what?

693
00:42:23.861 --> 00:42:26.660
Don't play coy.
I saw you outside my tent.

694
00:42:26.741 --> 00:42:29.099
What? I haven't left my post.

695
00:42:29.181 --> 00:42:32.380
And I suppose you weren't gossiping
about me with the princesses?

696
00:42:32.461 --> 00:42:35.100
Shang, did that dip in the river
get you waterlogged?

697
00:42:35.181 --> 00:42:38.060
And why are you talking
with your hand over your mouth?

698
00:42:38.142 --> 00:42:40.820
I wouldn't want to peel your paint.

699
00:42:43.221 --> 00:42:44.740
Changing of the guard.

700
00:42:44.821 --> 00:42:47.100
And next time, don't leave your post.

701
00:42:48.301 --> 00:42:49.420
What's with him?

702
00:42:51.822 --> 00:42:53.341
What's with her?

703
00:42:53.421 --> 00:42:55.141
Who am I talking to?

704
00:42:56.382 --> 00:42:58.541
How could he not believe me?

705
00:42:59.342 --> 00:43:00.861
I don't know, girlfriend.

706
00:43:00.941 --> 00:43:05.981
But I do know this. Without trust,
there can be no relationship.

707
00:43:06.421 --> 00:43:08.221
And that man don't trust you.

708
00:43:08.302 --> 00:43:09.941
Maybe he was just confused.

709
00:43:10.022 --> 00:43:12.461
Please. First, you fussed
about the arranged marriage.

710
00:43:12.542 --> 00:43:14.101
Then you fought
about which way to Qui Gong.

711
00:43:14.182 --> 00:43:16.821
Now, y'all feuding over nothing.
It seems pretty clear to me.

712
00:43:16.902 --> 00:43:18.061
You're right.

713
00:43:19.182 --> 00:43:21.821
- Mushu, I don't know what to do.
- I do. It's simple.

714
00:43:21.902 --> 00:43:24.622
Drop that boy like a hot pot sticker.
Kick him to the curb.

715
00:43:24.702 --> 00:43:26.781
Burn his letters
and dance around the fire yelling,

716
00:43:26.862 --> 00:43:29.301
"Happy days are here again."

717
00:43:29.382 --> 00:43:30.502
You know, you have a point.

718
00:43:30.582 --> 00:43:33.662
If this is the real Li Shang,
I don't like what I'm seeing.

719
00:43:40.343 --> 00:43:41.781
I hope the tea is still warm.

720
00:43:50.783 --> 00:43:53.182
- After you.
- No, after you.

721
00:43:53.263 --> 00:43:55.062
- No, after you.
- After you.

722
00:43:55.143 --> 00:43:56.862
I said, after you.

723
00:44:05.383 --> 00:44:06.463
You, I'm gonna...

724
00:44:06.543 --> 00:44:07.823
Yao.

725
00:44:08.463 --> 00:44:10.502
Is everything all right?

726
00:44:10.943 --> 00:44:11.982
No.

727
00:44:12.464 --> 00:44:13.942
I mean, yes.

728
00:44:14.023 --> 00:44:17.703
You see, Chien-Po here
has always had a dream.

729
00:44:17.784 --> 00:44:19.502
- A dream?
- A dream?

730
00:44:19.584 --> 00:44:21.903
- A dream.
- But I don't...

731
00:44:23.343 --> 00:44:24.663
That dream.

732
00:44:24.743 --> 00:44:28.543
A dream of seeing a small village
in the middle of nowhere

733
00:44:28.624 --> 00:44:30.223
by the moonlight.

734
00:44:30.504 --> 00:44:31.583
How can we help?

735
00:44:31.664 --> 00:44:36.303
Well, if Your Highnesses would consent
to come with us to the village,

736
00:44:36.384 --> 00:44:40.863
we could still guard you,
and Chien-Po could have his dream.

737
00:44:40.944 --> 00:44:44.183
My one chance to be like other guys.

738
00:44:44.264 --> 00:44:45.544
- Can we? Can we?
- Can we, please?

739
00:44:45.624 --> 00:44:47.864
- Please, come on.
- Ting Ting, please.

740
00:44:47.944 --> 00:44:49.063
Sounds like fun.

741
00:44:49.144 --> 00:44:50.543
Hurray! Hurray!

742
00:44:52.024 --> 00:44:53.184
We're sorry.

743
00:44:53.264 --> 00:44:54.704
We're off.

744
00:44:55.665 --> 00:44:57.783
I never noticed we were so different.

745
00:44:58.224 --> 00:45:00.024
It's like I don't even know him.

746
00:45:00.305 --> 00:45:02.423
Well, what do you know about that?

747
00:45:02.505 --> 00:45:07.223
I mean, I know he's by the book,
but doesn't the man ever bend a rule?

748
00:45:07.305 --> 00:45:09.423
And speaking of bending rules...

749
00:45:09.505 --> 00:45:12.944
You know, relationships are easy
when everything runs nice and smooth.

750
00:45:13.025 --> 00:45:14.464
- But...
- Mulan.

751
00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:17.584
- Nice and smooth just ran out of camp.
- What?

752
00:45:17.665 --> 00:45:20.264
Did you know that almonds, rice and
milk are part of a complete breakfast?

753
00:45:20.345 --> 00:45:21.304
Mushu.

754
00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:23.824
I'm just trying to tell you
the princesses went AWOL, that's all.

755
00:45:23.905 --> 00:45:26.704
- Where are the guards?
- Showing them the way.

756
00:45:26.785 --> 00:45:28.224
They're together?

757
00:45:28.746 --> 00:45:31.144
- "Together" together?
- Don't you understand Chinese?

758
00:45:35.026 --> 00:45:36.864
Hey, what about old Shang-hai?

759
00:45:36.946 --> 00:45:39.265
I think I better handle this one
on my own.

760
00:45:39.345 --> 00:45:41.705
Shang's on a short fuse as it is.

761
00:45:41.785 --> 00:45:43.945
Just make sure nothing wakes him up.

762
00:45:45.946 --> 00:45:48.065
You can count on me.

763
00:46:05.106 --> 00:46:06.745
Where are the guards?

764
00:46:07.106 --> 00:46:08.465
The princesses.

765
00:46:17.306 --> 00:46:19.026
"My duty is to my heart"?

766
00:46:23.267 --> 00:46:25.026
Mulan.

767
00:46:30.427 --> 00:46:31.586
Get your ticket, cricket.

768
00:46:31.667 --> 00:46:33.146
The show's about to begin.

769
00:46:53.267 --> 00:46:55.547
Look at all the food.

770
00:46:58.227 --> 00:47:00.546
We just got in some excellent ginger.

771
00:47:01.988 --> 00:47:03.067
Ginger.

772
00:47:03.147 --> 00:47:05.507
That goes very well with dumplings.

773
00:47:05.587 --> 00:47:07.267
Did you say dumplings?

774
00:47:08.828 --> 00:47:10.507
How about some fresh ginseng?

775
00:47:10.588 --> 00:47:13.266
That makes a wonderful
accompaniment to soy beans.

776
00:47:13.348 --> 00:47:16.107
One order of soy beans.

777
00:47:21.988 --> 00:47:23.907
- He's done.
- You're done.

778
00:47:24.428 --> 00:47:25.347
Oh, my.

779
00:47:25.428 --> 00:47:29.747
Who will be next to challenge
the undefeated Shi Rongkai?

780
00:47:32.548 --> 00:47:34.427
- Step aside.
- Yao.

781
00:47:34.708 --> 00:47:36.627
- Oh, no.
- You'll be killed, little man.

782
00:47:43.149 --> 00:47:45.107
So where does he go?

783
00:47:48.388 --> 00:47:50.508
Yao, you're my hero.

784
00:47:50.588 --> 00:47:53.348
Little, like a little gorilla.

785
00:47:55.389 --> 00:47:57.268
Pick a prize, any prize.

786
00:47:58.108 --> 00:48:00.348
Which one do you want, sir?

787
00:48:01.989 --> 00:48:03.309
Give me that one.

788
00:48:10.389 --> 00:48:12.909
Okay, okay.

789
00:48:12.989 --> 00:48:14.908
Okay, okay, how about this one?

790
00:48:14.989 --> 00:48:18.749
What does Attila say
when he walks through the door?

791
00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:21.829
Hun, I'm home.

792
00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:29.309
I give up.

793
00:48:29.389 --> 00:48:31.669
I guess I'm not as funny as I think.

794
00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:47.909
- What a cute laugh.
- Oh, no. I hate my laugh.

795
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:49.829
What? It's adorable.

796
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:52.709
I thought you didn't have
a sense of humor.

797
00:48:52.791 --> 00:48:54.349
No sense of humor?

798
00:49:17.671 --> 00:49:20.070
It's so beautiful.

799
00:49:20.151 --> 00:49:21.870
Yeah.

800
00:49:22.551 --> 00:49:24.750
It's the same moon
we see from the palace.

801
00:49:24.831 --> 00:49:29.110
No, this one is entirely different.

802
00:49:29.831 --> 00:49:30.910
You're right.

803
00:49:30.991 --> 00:49:32.950
I know I've never seen anything like it.

804
00:49:33.031 --> 00:49:34.270
Mulan.

805
00:49:34.352 --> 00:49:36.271
- I'm listening.
- We...

806
00:49:36.471 --> 00:49:38.631
- That is...
- All of us...

807
00:49:39.471 --> 00:49:42.750
- Oh, boy.
- Fa Mulan, it's love.

808
00:49:42.832 --> 00:49:44.670
Yao and myself, Chien-Po and Su...

809
00:49:44.752 --> 00:49:46.391
And myself and Lingy Bear.

810
00:49:46.471 --> 00:49:47.830
I mean, Ling.

811
00:49:51.951 --> 00:49:53.991
Group hug.

812
00:49:54.872 --> 00:49:57.111
I'm so happy for all of you.

813
00:50:00.792 --> 00:50:02.231
General Shang.

814
00:50:03.232 --> 00:50:05.512
- General Shang.
- Oh, boy.

815
00:50:07.272 --> 00:50:10.152
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

816
00:50:10.232 --> 00:50:12.311
Don't worry. I'll handle this.

817
00:50:12.952 --> 00:50:15.191
I'm so sorry to break up your little party.

818
00:50:15.832 --> 00:50:17.432
This is gonna be good.

819
00:50:17.512 --> 00:50:19.472
Shang, before you jump to conclusions,

820
00:50:19.552 --> 00:50:20.992
let me explain the situation.

821
00:50:21.072 --> 00:50:22.872
Fine. Why don't we start with this?

822
00:50:23.352 --> 00:50:25.512
- That's mine.
- All yours?

823
00:50:25.592 --> 00:50:26.791
Or did you have help?

824
00:50:26.873 --> 00:50:30.032
"And so, my dear father,
I cannot complete this mission.

825
00:50:30.113 --> 00:50:33.272
"I have come to realize
that my duty is to my heart."

826
00:50:33.353 --> 00:50:36.232
- Now, who does that sound like?
- Mei never meant to send that letter.

827
00:50:36.313 --> 00:50:39.152
Your Highnesses, you swore a vow
to be married in Qui Gong.

828
00:50:39.233 --> 00:50:42.112
If your father saw you now
breaking that vow,

829
00:50:42.193 --> 00:50:43.352
what would he say?

830
00:50:45.273 --> 00:50:47.753
You three are to escort
Their Highnesses

831
00:50:47.833 --> 00:50:49.432
back to their tents immediately.

832
00:50:49.513 --> 00:50:51.912
You are to guard them.
You are not to enter their tents.

833
00:50:51.994 --> 00:50:53.432
You are not to speak to them.

834
00:50:53.514 --> 00:50:56.913
Not a word, ever. Am I understood?

835
00:50:56.993 --> 00:50:58.232
Yes, sir.

836
00:51:12.074 --> 00:51:14.553
Shang, the problem
isn't as bad as it seems.

837
00:51:14.634 --> 00:51:16.993
- The problem, Mulan, is you.
- What?

838
00:51:17.074 --> 00:51:19.473
You place your own feelings
above everything.

839
00:51:19.554 --> 00:51:22.593
Duty, obligation, tradition,
it all means nothing to you.

840
00:51:22.674 --> 00:51:24.393
It means everything to me.

841
00:51:24.474 --> 00:51:26.873
My heart tells me my duty,
and I follow it.

842
00:51:28.194 --> 00:51:29.994
You're a brilliant warrior, Shang.

843
00:51:31.874 --> 00:51:36.674
You're brave, you're loyal,
but you don't trust your heart.

844
00:51:37.954 --> 00:51:40.193
Sometimes I wonder
if you even have one.

845
00:51:41.554 --> 00:51:44.394
This assignment has made it clear.

846
00:51:44.475 --> 00:51:46.873
We are very different people.

847
00:51:47.994 --> 00:51:49.514
Maybe too different.

848
00:51:50.434 --> 00:51:51.553
Fine.

849
00:51:54.195 --> 00:51:55.834
We have a mission to complete.

850
00:51:58.755 --> 00:51:59.994
Fine.

851
00:52:24.956 --> 00:52:27.035
Isn't it a great day?

852
00:52:43.476 --> 00:52:45.955
I see Pretty Boy isn't talking to you.

853
00:52:46.036 --> 00:52:48.115
And you're not talking to Pretty Boy.

854
00:52:48.996 --> 00:52:50.795
Well, you know you can always
talk to me.

855
00:52:54.676 --> 00:52:57.476
Well, just wait till she realizes
what I've done for her.

856
00:52:57.556 --> 00:52:59.475
Will that frown turn upside down.

857
00:53:01.877 --> 00:53:03.395
Snapdragon?

858
00:53:03.477 --> 00:53:05.436
Just for that, I'm not talking to you.

859
00:53:09.277 --> 00:53:12.356
We're so sorry for what we've done,
Fa Mulan.

860
00:53:12.437 --> 00:53:14.956
You inspired us to follow our hearts.

861
00:53:15.037 --> 00:53:17.916
And we repay you
by ruining your relationship.

862
00:53:17.997 --> 00:53:21.596
No, you just opened my eyes
to how broken it was.

863
00:53:21.916 --> 00:53:23.476
I'm indebted to you, Mei.

864
00:53:35.517 --> 00:53:37.996
Keep a sharp eye.
This is bandit country.

865
00:53:44.118 --> 00:53:48.357
I sure wish we could talk
to the princesses, Yao.

866
00:53:48.438 --> 00:53:50.677
What? You know we can't.

867
00:53:53.398 --> 00:53:57.117
Yes, Ling, I also wish
we could talk to them.

868
00:53:57.198 --> 00:54:00.237
But as you know, orders is orders.

869
00:54:00.317 --> 00:54:06.437
Yes, but if I could talk to them,
do you know what I would say?

870
00:54:06.518 --> 00:54:10.837
No, Ling.
What would you say if only you could?

871
00:54:10.918 --> 00:54:14.797
I'd tell Ting Ting
that she's the prettiest, funniest,

872
00:54:14.878 --> 00:54:17.877
most extraordinary girl I've ever met.

873
00:54:18.478 --> 00:54:20.397
I would tell Princess Su

874
00:54:20.478 --> 00:54:25.717
that she is like fresh ginger
on the rice bowl of my life.

875
00:54:27.279 --> 00:54:32.878
And I would tell Mei
that she's one right babe.

876
00:54:46.079 --> 00:54:49.118
Mulan, what do you say
to a little pick-me-up?

877
00:54:49.599 --> 00:54:52.878
My father said
differences can make you stronger.

878
00:54:53.479 --> 00:54:56.478
He didn't realize
that Shang and I are just too different.

879
00:54:56.879 --> 00:55:00.038
Well, you know you always got me.

880
00:55:00.279 --> 00:55:02.559
The old team, right?

881
00:55:03.959 --> 00:55:06.359
You're always looking out
for me, Mushu.

882
00:55:06.879 --> 00:55:09.158
Well, just doing the best I can.

883
00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:12.399
Really, I just don't know what I'd do
without you.

884
00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.159
You're the best friend I've ever had.

885
00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:21.918
I can't stand it no more.

886
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.479
The only thing wrong
with you and Shang is me.

887
00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:27.839
I'm the one that got between you.

888
00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:29.759
What are you talking about?

889
00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:32.119
It's not like you made the carriage
go into the river.

890
00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:33.560
Now, that was an accident.

891
00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:35.959
Following several attempts
at on purpose.

892
00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:39.519
And it wasn't you outside Shang's tent.

893
00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:41.719
You know how I gab.

894
00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:44.120
And you woke him up after I left?

895
00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:46.239
It wasn't easy neither.
That man can sleep.

896
00:55:46.321 --> 00:55:49.519
- Mushu, what did you do?
- Well, I was banging pots and pans.

897
00:55:49.601 --> 00:55:52.040
No. What did you do?

898
00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:54.760
You was getting married.
Everything was gonna change.

899
00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:57.439
I was gonna lose you. And my pedestal.

900
00:55:57.521 --> 00:56:00.560
You mean, you got between Shang
and me so you could keep your job?

901
00:56:00.641 --> 00:56:02.120
I'm sorry.

902
00:56:02.201 --> 00:56:04.800
What you did was unforgivable.

903
00:56:04.881 --> 00:56:07.760
But you and Shang are so different.

904
00:56:07.841 --> 00:56:11.440
Wait a second.
Not as different as I thought.

905
00:56:11.841 --> 00:56:15.521
All those problems, they weren't us.
They were you.

906
00:56:17.121 --> 00:56:19.240
I've got to talk to Shang,
tell him I love him.

907
00:56:20.121 --> 00:56:22.560
Mulan, I'll make it up to you. I promise.

908
00:56:22.642 --> 00:56:24.640
Forget it. You've helped enough.

909
00:56:25.161 --> 00:56:27.360
Shang. Shang.

910
00:56:28.402 --> 00:56:30.161
- It's an ambush.
- Bandits.

911
00:56:30.241 --> 00:56:32.000
Close ranks. Save the princesses.

912
00:56:33.882 --> 00:56:35.560
- Run, run.
- You two, get the gold.

913
00:56:35.642 --> 00:56:37.601
- Come on.
- You two, come with me.

914
00:56:37.962 --> 00:56:39.081
I got them.

915
00:56:39.162 --> 00:56:40.640
Shang, I've got your back.

916
00:56:44.362 --> 00:56:46.001
Take my hand.

917
00:56:49.402 --> 00:56:51.921
- Help!
- The princesses.

918
00:56:52.322 --> 00:56:55.842
- How dare you touch me?
- It won't budge.

919
00:56:55.922 --> 00:56:57.721
- Then take the whole package.
- No.

920
00:56:57.802 --> 00:56:59.441
Get your hands off her.

921
00:57:03.643 --> 00:57:05.761
Help!

922
00:57:05.843 --> 00:57:07.121
- No!
- Mei.

923
00:57:07.203 --> 00:57:08.882
Yao!

924
00:57:09.243 --> 00:57:10.922
Hold them off. Let's go.

925
00:57:14.723 --> 00:57:16.041
Help me.

926
00:57:17.643 --> 00:57:19.082
Run.

927
00:57:19.843 --> 00:57:21.162
- Mei.
- Yao.

928
00:57:24.963 --> 00:57:26.202
Come on.

929
00:57:40.203 --> 00:57:41.523
Let's get out of here.

930
00:57:49.284 --> 00:57:51.083
Shang, hang on.

931
00:57:51.163 --> 00:57:54.963
- It won't hold us both.
- It will. It will, Shang.

932
00:57:57.484 --> 00:57:58.603
Mulan.

933
00:58:00.043 --> 00:58:02.163
- I'm sorry.
- Please.

934
00:58:03.604 --> 00:58:05.083
Shang.

935
00:58:05.164 --> 00:58:06.843
Shang!

936
00:58:53.405 --> 00:58:55.004
Shang.

937
00:59:16.366 --> 00:59:19.765
Fa Mulan, we're ready to go through
with the wedding.

938
00:59:19.846 --> 00:59:21.325
No.

939
00:59:21.406 --> 00:59:24.045
Your orders are to take care
of each other.

940
00:59:24.125 --> 00:59:25.725
But...

941
00:59:26.846 --> 00:59:29.765
Losing Shang will not be meaningless.

942
00:59:30.326 --> 00:59:33.725
No matter what it takes,
I'm finishing this mission.

943
01:00:11.487 --> 01:00:12.806
Good horse.

944
01:00:15.847 --> 01:00:17.806
What do you mean, they are gone?

945
01:00:17.887 --> 01:00:19.566
There was an accident, Lord Chin.

946
01:00:19.648 --> 01:00:22.326
The royal carriage fell into the river
and was destroyed.

947
01:00:23.967 --> 01:00:26.887
A grave loss.

948
01:00:29.727 --> 01:00:33.167
But it does not alter my agreement
with the Emperor.

949
01:00:33.247 --> 01:00:35.207
And unless it is honored,

950
01:00:35.288 --> 01:00:39.207
I will sanction no alliance
with the Middle Kingdom.

951
01:00:39.287 --> 01:00:42.566
- A marriage was promised.
- And a marriage there will be.

952
01:00:45.128 --> 01:00:48.167
I would be honored
to wed a prince of Qui Gong.

953
01:00:48.248 --> 01:00:49.327
You?

954
01:00:49.408 --> 01:00:53.687
My Lord, Fa Mulan, the hero of China.

955
01:00:54.368 --> 01:01:00.047
A jewel in your crown far more dear
than three mere princesses.

956
01:01:04.048 --> 01:01:06.047
This is not what was agreed.

957
01:01:06.129 --> 01:01:11.527
However, the Golden Dragon of Unity
smiles upon you today.

958
01:01:11.849 --> 01:01:17.127
And in view of the tragedy,
I will accept your offer.

959
01:01:17.329 --> 01:01:22.528
You will make a fine bride
for my eldest son, Prince Jeeki.

960
01:01:31.449 --> 01:01:32.889
This is her?

961
01:01:32.969 --> 01:01:34.928
She's so old.

962
01:01:39.289 --> 01:01:43.569
Mulan said she was gonna
finish the mission no matter what.

963
01:01:43.649 --> 01:01:46.088
But how can she without us?

964
01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:47.488
By taking your place.

965
01:01:49.050 --> 01:01:50.328
Shang's alive.

966
01:01:50.410 --> 01:01:52.849
Shang, you're alive. You're alive.

967
01:01:56.489 --> 01:01:57.608
Mulan was right.

968
01:01:57.690 --> 01:02:00.089
No one should marry someone
they don't love.

969
01:02:00.970 --> 01:02:02.209
I'm going to Qui Gong.

970
01:02:02.290 --> 01:02:04.969
- We're going with you.
- No, you're not. Stay here.

971
01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:10.649
Would you say that was an order?

972
01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:14.129
I would say it was a friendly suggestion.

973
01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:16.689
Let's go.

974
01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:31.729
Looks like we won't be a team
after all, Mushu.

975
01:02:33.891 --> 01:02:35.209
Mulan.

976
01:02:36.810 --> 01:02:40.529
I would give up 1,000 pedestals
if I could stop this.

977
01:02:44.131 --> 01:02:47.850
I doubt even the Golden Dragon
of Unity could stop this now.

978
01:02:50.611 --> 01:02:52.290
Goodbye, Mushu.

979
01:03:34.732 --> 01:03:36.891
My people,

980
01:03:36.972 --> 01:03:42.011
the Golden Dragon of Unity,
who guides us in all we do,

981
01:03:42.092 --> 01:03:47.611
today sanctifies a union that will be
a blessing for all of Qui Gong.

982
01:04:02.053 --> 01:04:03.372
Of course I wanna stop it.

983
01:04:03.453 --> 01:04:05.492
But what can one itty-bitty dragon do?

984
01:04:05.573 --> 01:04:08.172
With the tying of this sash,

985
01:04:08.253 --> 01:04:13.492
we shall unite not only two lives,
but two kingdoms.

986
01:04:17.054 --> 01:04:19.492
- It's General Li Shang.
- He's alive.

987
01:04:24.613 --> 01:04:27.053
Yeah, Shang to the rescue.

988
01:04:27.133 --> 01:04:30.092
Lucky for Lord Chin,
because I was about to whip his butt.

989
01:04:35.654 --> 01:04:36.653
You're alive.

990
01:04:36.734 --> 01:04:38.452
I couldn't let you get married
without me.

991
01:04:38.534 --> 01:04:40.573
General, this is outrageous.

992
01:04:40.653 --> 01:04:44.173
- You will leave at once.
- I'm not going anywhere.

993
01:04:45.094 --> 01:04:47.893
- What are you doing?
- I don't know. I'm winging it.

994
01:04:47.974 --> 01:04:51.213
How dare you trample
upon this sacred ceremony?

995
01:04:51.294 --> 01:04:53.933
Oh, my gosh, he's gonna lower
the hammer on Shang.

996
01:04:54.014 --> 01:04:56.733
Where is the dang Dragon of Unity
when you need him?

997
01:04:59.054 --> 01:05:00.813
Don't bother me now, Cri-Kee, I...

998
01:05:03.974 --> 01:05:07.053
I have an idea.

999
01:05:07.694 --> 01:05:11.093
My lord, I love Mulan,
and I don't care what the rules say.

1000
01:05:11.374 --> 01:05:15.653
If she'll have me, I intend to marry her
right here, right now.

1001
01:05:15.735 --> 01:05:17.853
Insolent dog.

1002
01:05:17.935 --> 01:05:19.014
Seize him.

1003
01:05:19.094 --> 01:05:20.534
- Shang.
- Mulan.

1004
01:05:23.975 --> 01:05:27.374
Yo, what's with all this drama?

1005
01:05:28.975 --> 01:05:32.174
The Golden Dragon of Unity. He lives.

1006
01:05:32.255 --> 01:05:33.414
Mushu?

1007
01:05:40.815 --> 01:05:42.814
You dang right, I live.

1008
01:05:42.896 --> 01:05:45.654
So you best drop
your dumpling-eating behind on down

1009
01:05:45.735 --> 01:05:48.054
and tell me why we ain't busting out
the vows already?

1010
01:05:48.135 --> 01:05:53.774
But, Your Greatness, General Li Shang
is not a son of Qui Gong.

1011
01:05:53.895 --> 01:05:55.335
Silence!

1012
01:05:56.616 --> 01:06:00.094
I am the Golden Dragon of Unity.

1013
01:06:00.176 --> 01:06:03.535
And I decide whom to unify.

1014
01:06:04.016 --> 01:06:09.775
My all-seeing eye has peered
into the very heart of China.

1015
01:06:10.136 --> 01:06:15.095
And I've never seen two people
more right for one another

1016
01:06:15.176 --> 01:06:18.895
than this lovely couple right here,
Mulan and Shang.

1017
01:06:19.296 --> 01:06:20.855
Give it up for them, would you please?

1018
01:06:21.976 --> 01:06:24.695
Now, I command you
to proceed at once.

1019
01:06:24.776 --> 01:06:26.815
Yes, Your Greatness, as you command.

1020
01:06:26.896 --> 01:06:29.376
Now let's get down to business.
Mulan, do you love Shang?

1021
01:06:29.456 --> 01:06:30.815
Of course you do.
Shang, do you love Mulan?

1022
01:06:30.897 --> 01:06:32.096
Yes, very much, moving on.

1023
01:06:32.176 --> 01:06:35.055
By the power vested in me, by me.

1024
01:06:35.137 --> 01:06:38.376
I hereby pronounce you
husband and wife.

1025
01:06:38.456 --> 01:06:40.176
You got anything to say,
Lord Double Chin?

1026
01:06:41.537 --> 01:06:42.855
Yes. I mean, no.

1027
01:06:42.937 --> 01:06:45.175
I mean, whatever you say.

1028
01:06:52.497 --> 01:06:55.096
And furthermore, I hereby decree

1029
01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:57.256
that the princesses
of the Middle Kingdom,

1030
01:06:57.337 --> 01:06:58.337
wherever they may be,

1031
01:06:58.417 --> 01:07:03.137
are released from their vow and
may marry whomsoever they please.

1032
01:07:03.217 --> 01:07:05.416
And who pleases them,
that's very important.

1033
01:07:05.977 --> 01:07:07.256
Honey pie.

1034
01:07:56.498 --> 01:07:59.858
I can't believe
I'm back on wake-up duty.

1035
01:08:01.139 --> 01:08:03.618
Well, Mulan is happy.

1036
01:08:03.699 --> 01:08:06.257
And if she's happy, I'm happy.

1037
01:08:07.939 --> 01:08:09.418
Thank you, Cri-Kee.

1038
01:08:09.499 --> 01:08:11.298
I did do good, didn't I?

1039
01:08:11.379 --> 01:08:13.338
Better get your rest, Mushu.

1040
01:08:13.419 --> 01:08:15.378
I have a yoga session at dawn,

1041
01:08:15.459 --> 01:08:18.218
and I don't want to be late
for my greetings to the sun.

1042
01:08:18.299 --> 01:08:20.098
And don't forget.

1043
01:08:20.179 --> 01:08:22.778
I like to be awakened
from my beauty sleep

1044
01:08:22.859 --> 01:08:25.938
with a nice long foot massage.

1045
01:08:26.819 --> 01:08:28.419
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1046
01:08:36.819 --> 01:08:39.939
- Shang, what are you doing?
- Watch and see.

1047
01:08:40.019 --> 01:08:43.099
- What is he doing?
- It can't be.

1048
01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:45.859
He's combining the family temples.

1049
01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:47.019
No.

1050
01:08:47.099 --> 01:08:49.858
Excuse me,
what does that mean exactly?

1051
01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:51.099
You know, for me?

1052
01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:52.379
It means...

1053
01:08:52.459 --> 01:08:54.219
Yeah, what, what? It means what?

1054
01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:58.859
Unfortunately,
you get to keep your pedestal.

1055
01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:00.579
Yeah.

1056
01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:02.139
I'm back, baby.

1057
01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.259
I am back!

1058
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:07.579
Yes.

1059
01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:13.380
So this is the famous Mushu?

1060
01:09:14.621 --> 01:09:17.540
Somehow I pictured you bigger.

1061
01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:19.219
Say what?

1062
01:09:19.301 --> 01:09:21.860
You told him about me? About us?

1063
01:09:22.581 --> 01:09:25.379
I have no secrets
from my husband, Mushu.

1064
01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:27.460
I told him everything.

1065
01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:30.579
"Everything" everything?

1066
01:09:30.661 --> 01:09:34.420
That's right,
Great Golden Dragon of Unity.

1067
01:09:37.181 --> 01:09:38.540
I still don't get it.

1068
01:09:38.621 --> 01:09:40.740
What does combining our temples do?

1069
01:09:40.821 --> 01:09:43.580
It gives me back my pedestal.

1070
01:09:44.621 --> 01:09:46.380
Wait, but can you do this?

1071
01:09:46.462 --> 01:09:48.540
- Aren't there rules?
- Of course.

1072
01:09:48.621 --> 01:09:50.820
Right next to the rules
about dressing up like a man

1073
01:09:50.901 --> 01:09:52.260
and joining the army.

1074
01:09:53.462 --> 01:09:54.500
Well, what do you know?

1075
01:09:54.581 --> 01:09:56.660
This thing just might work out after all.

1076
01:09:58.341 --> 01:10:00.821
Hey, yo, where's my masseuse?

1077
01:10:00.901 --> 01:10:03.500
Saving China gives me knots
like you wouldn't believe.

1078
01:10:04.382 --> 01:10:05.781
And what about my pedicure?

1079
01:10:05.861 --> 01:10:07.701
Let's get jamming on the toe jam,
people.

1080
01:10:07.782 --> 01:10:09.341
And somebody heat up some oil.

1081
01:10:09.422 --> 01:10:11.461
I don't know
what we're gonna do with it yet,

1082
01:10:11.542 --> 01:10:13.381
but it's gonna be good.

1083
01:10:13.462 --> 01:10:15.701
Does a hero dragon
deserve anything less?

1084
01:10:15.782 --> 01:10:17.061
Draw my bath.

1085
01:10:17.142 --> 01:10:22.261
Warm my towels.
Let the pampering begin.
