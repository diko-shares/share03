00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.150
In ancient times, the world was
ruled by gods and monsters.

2
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.180
But it was the half-god Perseus,
my son...

3
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.060
...who defeated the Kraken
and saved humanity.

4
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.000
For his courage, I offered him
a place to rule at my side.

5
00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.490
But Perseus...

6
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.440
...was strong-willed
and chose a different path.

7
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.770
He vowed to live as a man.

8
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.810
Even when fate took his wife...

9
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.640
...he would not pray for help, from me...

10
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.840
...or the other gods.

11
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.450
And now the time of the gods is ending.

12
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.890
But the son of Zeus cannot hide
from his destiny forever.

13
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.630
Now pull it in. Do it again.

14
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.740
Throw in the other one real quick.
Go on. I will tie this off.

15
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.310
Good catch today, Dad.

16
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.010
- Where'd you get that?
- I made it myself.

17
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.680
You made it yourself? Heh.

18
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.420
I want to be a good god
and do good things.

19
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.560
- There's no such thing as good gods.
- Some of them are good.

20
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.260
Ah. Helius, there's more to life
than gods and Titans.

21
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.360
Hey, Clea. I have a confession to make.

22
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.030
I, uh, needed him for chores
so he skipped studying.

23
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.010
Now, you do a good job, make me proud.

24
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.930
I know you're here.

25
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.910
I visit him sometimes in his dreams.

26
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.670
He's like his father.
A strong-willed boy.

27
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.240
You just passing through?

28
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.550
No.

29
00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.590
I need your help...

30
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.820
...Perseus.

31
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.120
You're the great god Zeus.
You don't need my help.

32
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.260
There is a calamity coming.

33
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.420
It will affect us all. Gods and men.

34
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.140
The humans may have stopped praying
to us... With good reason.

35
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.830
...but there are consequences.

36
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.240
Without prayer, we gods lose our power.

37
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.110
When our power leaves us,
all our work comes undone. All of it.

38
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.490
The walls of Tartarus are falling.

39
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.490
It is emptying all its demons onto the
earth. The first are already here.

40
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.930
If our power diminishes much further,
we gods will become mortal.

41
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.670
We will die and Kronos himself will escape.

42
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.880
It will mean chaos. The end of the world.

43
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.970
What am I meant to do?

44
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.140
This is business for gods.

45
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.320
We need all our children now.

46
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.840
Perhaps, together...

47
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.490
...we can remedy this.

48
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.390
But we need every shred of power, Perseus.

49
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.350
I will never leave my son.

50
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.360
I know your heart better
than you know it yourself.

51
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:24.070
You believe your human half
makes you unworthy to join us.

52
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.810
You will learn someday that...

53
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.500
...being half-human...

54
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.880
...makes you stronger than a god,
not weaker.

55
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.910
I think you should go.

56
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.990
Sleep well, Perseus.

57
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.200
I will never leave my son.

58
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.530
Zeus.

59
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.010
Poseidon.

60
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.170
Brother.

61
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.010
It has been an age.

62
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.050
Indeed, it has.

63
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.220
Ares.

64
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.430
My son.

65
00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.960
Where's my brother Perseus?

66
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.030
Gone fishing?

67
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.440
Yes.

68
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.440
What a brave and noble decision.

69
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:17.380
Let us go, then.

70
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.970
Tartarus.
The great prison of the underworld.

71
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.160
Brother Hades.

72
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.330
We have come to your domain...

73
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:47.500
...as agreed.

74
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.500
Show yourself to us.

75
00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.290
After so many years...

76
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:04.550
...the sons of Kronos, together once more.

77
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.420
Brothers in arms.

78
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.030
Hades...

79
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:12.430
...you are the great
ruler of the underworld.

80
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.240
Allow us to enter and help you rebuild...

81
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.640
...the walls of Tartarus.

82
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.140
My beloved brother,
who banished me here for eternity...

83
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.580
...to look after our father, now seeks...

84
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.380
...reconciliation.

85
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.710
We must forget the past, brother...

86
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.120
...and unite.

87
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.250
Yes.

88
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.290
But on my terms.

89
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.330
Poseidon.

90
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.480
Above you.

91
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:06.750
Poseidon.

92
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.440
It has begun.

93
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.610
Helius?

94
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.480
Helius.

95
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.520
Stay away, stay away.

96
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:26.900
Helius?

97
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.330
Helius.

98
00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:57.290
Chimera.

99
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.440
Helius.

100
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:09.870
Have you seen Helius?

101
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.680
Helius.

102
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:17.250
Get back.

103
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.480
Keep away. Its venom catches fire.

104
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.230
Stay down.

105
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.350
Helius, go with them.

106
00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.030
Take him.

107
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.430
I will find you. Go.

108
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.170
Go.

109
00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:15.770
- Dad.
- Run.

110
00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:16.610
Go.

111
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:19.980
Helius.

112
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:24.380
Helius.

113
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.560
- Dad, hurry.
- I am coming, son.

114
00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.560
Helius. Stay there.

115
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:41.000
Dad.

116
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.080
Helius.

117
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.210
Here.

118
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:54.810
Come and get me.

119
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.260
What are you waiting for? Burn me.

120
00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:36.410
Sit.

121
00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:43.520
Ohh.

122
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.690
Things are happening...

123
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.630
...in the world, Perseus.
You know that, you have instincts.

124
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:51.790
The son of a god.

125
00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.100
A son needs a father.

126
00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:57.830
I made a vow to lo.

127
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:02.110
I know, I know,
I was there delivering your son.

128
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:05.010
You vowed to your wife
you'd never let Helius wield a sword.

129
00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:07.340
That you'd live with him
as a simple fisherman.

130
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:12.480
Well, that's a fine game in normal times.

131
00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.930
But if you have power,
you also have a duty.

132
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.160
Just fix my body...

133
00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.500
...and leave my soul to me.

134
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.330
Where are we going?

135
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.940
I need to speak to my father.

136
00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.080
There's nothing to be frightened of.

137
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.220
This is the Mount of Idols.

138
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.510
The closest place to the heavens.

139
00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.960
It's a place where people come
to worship the gods.

140
00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:53.700
Or at least they used to come.

141
00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.330
Zeus?

142
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.270
Father.

143
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.600
Poseidon.

144
00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.890
What happened?

145
00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:34.730
Hades and Ares have joined Kronos...

146
00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.600
...against humanity.

147
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.770
All the gods have disappeared.

148
00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:43.040
- I fear the worst.
- Here, here.

149
00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:45.910
I got you, I got you.

150
00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.810
Where's my father?

151
00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.220
Captured.

152
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.920
You must journey to the underworld
and free him.

153
00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.950
They took my father.

154
00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.220
You're the only hope left in this world.

155
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.570
Or there will be oblivion.

156
00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.630
How do I do it?

157
00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:12.670
I am only half a god.

158
00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.900
Then you must find another half-god.

159
00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.410
Agenor.

160
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.570
He's my son.

161
00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.290
He's with Queen Andromeda.

162
00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:29.490
Tell him to take you to the Fallen One.

163
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.460
Poseidon.

164
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.560
Take this. Use it.

165
00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:43.200
If my son...

166
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.970
...survives and proves worthy...

167
00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.200
...give it to him.

168
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.380
My own son betrays me.

169
00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.710
Only when it suits you,
you remember I am your son.

170
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.220
Hades.

171
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.760
You're sweating like a human, brother.
Next, it will be tears.

172
00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.620
Don't waste words on him.

173
00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.720
Kronos is waiting...

174
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.230
...Father.

175
00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:45.900
What?

176
00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.370
Our father has offered us a deal.

177
00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:50.200
You fool.

178
00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.410
If we help him to escape Tartarus...

179
00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:57.880
...he will allow we few gods who remain
to keep our immortality.

180
00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.280
- No.
- Let him speak.

181
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:02.250
Let him speak.

182
00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:05.050
Are you becoming weak?

183
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:09.760
You're in the underworld, Ares,
where it's wise to obey me.

184
00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.020
You forget our father
once tried to kill us.

185
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.430
No, I remember everything.

186
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:23.100
And what exactly does our father want from
us in return for our precious immortality?

187
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:28.540
We simply offer him the last of your
divine powers so that he may free himself.

188
00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.710
Oh, Hades.

189
00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.710
What have I done to you?

190
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:48.760
You laugh as if you had a choice.

191
00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.730
There is no choice.

192
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.840
I hope you have enough of them.

193
00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:58.240
Pull him.

194
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.160
You will need it more than me.

195
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.530
Pegasus.

196
00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.440
Go on.

197
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:49.750
He likes you.

198
00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.160
Me, on the other hand....

199
00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:01.960
I love you.

200
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:03.640
I know.

201
00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:05.900
Come on.

202
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:16.340
Eh, whoa.
Keep it straight. Have it look good.

203
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:47.840
Come on, boy.

204
00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.220
More Chimera. Archers.

205
00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.720
Go, go, go.

206
00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.230
Ready. Fire.

207
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:04.060
- Chimera.
- Ready.

208
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.860
Hold your lines. Hold your lines.

209
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:09.760
Out of the way.

210
00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:12.070
Hold your fire.

211
00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:15.340
- I said hold your fire.
- Queen Andromeda.

212
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.550
Ah, keep it straight. Oy.

213
00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:21.780
Whoa.

214
00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.890
You used to be a lot better at this.

215
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:41.170
All hail Perseus, killer of the Kraken.

216
00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:43.310
Hail Perseus.

217
00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.100
Great Perseus.

218
00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:54.480
If it is action you're after,
you are a little late.

219
00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:57.320
I am just here to see Queen Andromeda.

220
00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.790
This is a battlefield.

221
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:02.290
- I am in command here.
- Uh-huh.

222
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:04.790
Well, I wish to speak to the queen.

223
00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.290
And the queen wishes to speak to you.

224
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.530
Your Majesty.

225
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.900
Come on.

226
00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:16.910
Hail Perseus.

227
00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.790
You have obviously been
in your own battles, Perseus.

228
00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.680
I have been busy with mine.

229
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.550
Yeah, you have.

230
00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:42.720
I won't keep you.

231
00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.800
It's been too long.

232
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:54.710
- I have a son now.
- I know. I'd like to meet him.

233
00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:58.140
And my wife, she... I know.

234
00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.380
I am sorry.

235
00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:03.350
Your Majesty.

236
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:09.890
For the sake of the men, we must
resolve our differences before sunset.

237
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:11.890
I made it clear we continue to fight...

238
00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:13.590
...the Chimera invaders.

239
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:16.200
Today in the field we lost 300 men...

240
00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.030
...for the death of four Chimera.
We have...

241
00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:22.570
...offended the gods. We need to pray.

242
00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:24.330
You'd pray to Ares, perhaps?

243
00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:26.700
As soldiers always have.

244
00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.670
What if I was to tell you that Ares
is your enemy now?

245
00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.280
I would make peace with him.

246
00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.580
You would make peace with the god of war?

247
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:36.050
Perseus.

248
00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:38.880
What's your strategy?

249
00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:43.890
There's a way we can end this,
and then I can get home.

250
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:46.950
What is this for?
It's to cut the oars for my trireme.

251
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:48.220
I need 170 oars...

252
00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:49.860
...for the three rows...

253
00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:50.690
...one oar per man.

254
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:52.870
This looks like a pick.

255
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:55.440
lt is, however, the rudder
for my flagship. Quiet.

256
00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.900
Morning checks, Your Majesty.

257
00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.270
Always eventful.

258
00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.540
Oh, Your Majesty.
Ah. So good to see you.

259
00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:07.510
This is Agenor. He's a liar and a thief.
I know it didn't work out between us...

260
00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.980
...but, please, do try and get over it.

261
00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.590
Have you ever had a woman
love you so much...

262
00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.790
...she locks you up like a pet rabbit?

263
00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:16.720
He wanted my hand in marriage.

264
00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.830
When I refused, he tried to run away
with the crown jewels.

265
00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:22.090
I think it's my extraordinary eyes.

266
00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:24.670
Actually, you got the eyes of your father.

267
00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.930
Do you know his father?

268
00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.230
Yeah, Agenor here...

269
00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.610
...he's the son of the great god Poseidon.

270
00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.610
Your new boyfriend is clearly insane.

271
00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.850
I am your cousin, Agenor.

272
00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.780
I am the son of Zeus.

273
00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.090
Half-god and abandoned just like you.

274
00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.650
If my father sent you...

275
00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.800
...I want nothing to do with you.

276
00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.460
Your father is dead.

277
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:58.160
Gods don't die.

278
00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.970
They do now.

279
00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.140
Good. Could you do me a favor?

280
00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.370
Anything.
Go to hell.

281
00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.610
That's exactly where I am going.

282
00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.710
I just need information.

283
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.220
Your father told me...

284
00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.620
...that you could help me
get to the Fallen One.

285
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:26.960
You long for the ocean, don't you?

286
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:30.530
It's like a thirst you cannot quench.

287
00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.900
It must be hell for you in here.

288
00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.900
I want a royal pardon.

289
00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.710
Granted.

290
00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.490
I want my body weight in gold.

291
00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:53.880
Granted.

292
00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:57.250
Few gold coins, you're so scrawny.

293
00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:00.590
Let me see. What else have I dreamt
of as I lay here in my cell?

294
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.130
Don't push it.

295
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:06.340
I am going to need a boat,
your fastest boat.

296
00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.770
The Fallen One lives far
across the ocean.

297
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:10.430
Where?

298
00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.370
Well, put me on the deck of the boat
and I will show you.

299
00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.080
Your ship awaits.

300
00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.920
Fetch my lucky cape.

301
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.730
Do you know why
this is my lucky cape, me old mate?

302
00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:33.890
Because the first time I wore it,
I sprouted a beard. A full-grown beard.

303
00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:35.730
Send word to every regiment...

304
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:38.960
...that's still intact to gather here
at the Tyrene pass.

305
00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.710
If I am not there in two days...

306
00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.800
...then you can pray.

307
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:47.180
Your Majesty.

308
00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:50.810
- Regroup at the garrison.
- You can't leave...

309
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:52.880
...Greece without a queen.

310
00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.180
Are you giving me orders now?

311
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:12.130
Unchain him.

312
00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:21.100
Show me where the Fallen One is.

313
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:24.110
Who is the Fallen One?

314
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:27.480
Oh, the god Hephaestus.
Heh, heh.

315
00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:31.350
And who's Hephaestus?

316
00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:36.160
Hephaestus was the god
that made Poseidon's trident...

317
00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:38.460
...Hades' pitchfork...

318
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.030
...and Zeus' thunderbolt.

319
00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:42.160
Put those together...

320
00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:45.630
...they form the Spear of Trium,
the weapon the gods used...

321
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:47.270
...to defeat Kronos.

322
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:49.740
But Hephaestus lives on the island
of Kail. Ha-ha-ha.

323
00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:52.140
Which no one has ever found.

324
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.310
Kail doesn't exist, does it, Agenor?

325
00:28:57.810 --> 00:28:58.470
It does...

326
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:59.950
...exist. I can take you.

327
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:02.340
Unchain me and give me the trident.

328
00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.890
If you unchain him, he will jump off
this boat, you will never see him again.

329
00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:08.250
Hephaestus can help you save your father.

330
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:31.480
Don't let our family down.

331
00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.200
Never doubted you for a second, Agenor.

332
00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:38.780
Great Kronos.

333
00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:39.970
Father.

334
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:44.040
We have delivered Zeus, your son...

335
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.220
...as you ordered.

336
00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.410
Zeus.

337
00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:07.630
Island of Kail.

338
00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.150
I am not touching that again.

339
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.660
What is it?

340
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:38.630
I don't know. But whoever
did this doesn't want us here.

341
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:39.830
We have no choice.

342
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:43.270
Fallen god has to live as close
to the heavens as possible.

343
00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:44.500
Streams run through.

344
00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.480
Higher ground's that way.

345
00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.940
- What...?
- Look.

346
00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:17.880
Don't move.

347
00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:27.720
I can't see nothing.

348
00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.920
We should pray to the god of war.
Warriors.

349
00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.650
I know it is your custom, but no
matter what we're about to face...

350
00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:35.590
...you do not pray to Ares.

351
00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:40.090
If you do, he will
find us and kill us all.

352
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.230
Close in.

353
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:44.560
Stay alert.

354
00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:53.480
Trip wire.

355
00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.080
- Agenor.
- Yeah, yeah. Saw it.

356
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:05.790
The most important thing
is to do nothing.

357
00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.850
Nothing, I can do well.

358
00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.970
Aah. For the love of Zeus.

359
00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:14.760
I told you to do nothing.

360
00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.030
I didn't do anything.
Just stay still.

361
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.300
No, no, no.

362
00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:23.640
Cut the counterweights.

363
00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:28.950
Don't cut the counterweight.

364
00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:31.090
Yeah, he's right,
the fall will kill him.

365
00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:48.470
Cut the counterweight.
Cut the counterweight.

366
00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:55.640
Agenor.

367
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:59.680
Cut the counterweight.
Cut the counterweight.

368
00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.110
Agenor.

369
00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.480
Agenor.

370
00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:32.970
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

371
00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.280
Stay down.

372
00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.210
Ah.

373
00:34:39.390 --> 00:34:40.120
What is it?

374
00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:41.580
Big.

375
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:43.280
Andromeda, slow him down.

376
00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:57.030
Now.

377
00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:59.030
Archers.

378
00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.130
Galenos...

379
00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:02.610
...give him support. You, follow me.

380
00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:16.860
No.

381
00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:54.960
I pray to you, great god Ares.
I pray to you...

382
00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.360
Shh.

383
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:04.570
Is it gone?

384
00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.490
Hey.

385
00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:26.690
This is going to be a bad idea.

386
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.330
Where's my cousin?

387
00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.310
Glad you're hanging in there.

388
00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:56.510
Yeah, I thought I'd give him an eyeful.

389
00:37:58.590 --> 00:37:59.920
What was that for?

390
00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:03.720
Poseidon.

391
00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:29.210
Poor Ares, always...

392
00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:30.850
...following orders.

393
00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:33.960
I am my own master.

394
00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.260
Yes, of course you are.

395
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:39.290
Perhaps it's only humans...

396
00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:40.720
...that have free will.

397
00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.060
There.

398
00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.270
Pain. Your lesson in being human.

399
00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.410
Why don't you weep?

400
00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:55.770
Why don't you weep like
your favorite son, Perseus?

401
00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:03.780
If I weep, it will be for you, Ares.

402
00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:06.920
Ares.

403
00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:08.790
Enough.

404
00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:11.220
Weep for your son.

405
00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.790
I said...

406
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:14.220
...enough.

407
00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:16.560
We are in this together, Hades.

408
00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.890
Do not weaken now.

409
00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:23.900
Your weakness is your blind hatred
for your father and your brother.

410
00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:29.100
You don't know when to stop fighting.

411
00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.280
You have already won.

412
00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:35.080
Kronos is draining Zeus' power.

413
00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:23.200
Hephaestus.

414
00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:43.320
Zeus?

415
00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:45.240
Ares.

416
00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:47.220
Hades.

417
00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.960
At last. I knew you'd come.

418
00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:54.600
Poseidon,
I can see your trident glinting.

419
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:57.500
Ha-ha-ha. Ah.

420
00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:00.730
It's not...

421
00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:01.960
...them.

422
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:07.170
We're looking for Hephaestus,
the maker...

423
00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:10.870
...of such mighty weapons.
Well, should I let them in?

424
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:13.570
He says no.

425
00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:18.080
But then he always says no.

426
00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:23.060
He always says...

427
00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:25.530
...no.

428
00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:26.420
Ahh.

429
00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:28.590
Yes.

430
00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:38.240
You are Perseus...

431
00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:40.630
...son of Zeus.

432
00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:43.270
I am.

433
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:46.010
"Release the Kraken," all of that.

434
00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.820
Yeah. Who are you?

435
00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:53.550
I am Agenor, son of Poseidon.

436
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:57.280
Agenor.

437
00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:59.730
Have you ever heard of Agenor?

438
00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:02.060
Never heard of you.

439
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:05.400
Well, your friend may also
know me by the name...

440
00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.660
...the Navigator.

441
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:10.830
Navigator?

442
00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.140
Navigator.

443
00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:17.640
Still no.

444
00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:20.810
Don't worry, son, he says
there are many useless demigods.

445
00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:25.180
"Useless"? About as useless
as your one-eyed friends.

446
00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.410
Those Cyclopes...

447
00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:29.180
...helped me forge the god-weapons.

448
00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:32.320
Have respect.

449
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:38.320
"Navigator."

450
00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.970
Mm-hm.

451
00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.630
Hold on, because...

452
00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:47.600
Poseidon dead, Zeus captured.
The words...

453
00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.270
...don't even sit together.

454
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:51.310
We need your help to rescue Zeus...

455
00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:53.110
...so he can stop Kronos.

456
00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:57.280
- That's the plan, is it?
- Yeah.

457
00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:01.320
Right. Right. Well, in that case,
we'd best prepare.

458
00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:04.050
For what?
The end of the bloody world.

459
00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:06.190
Kronos will dismantle the earth.

460
00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:09.520
You will be scattered
across the universe.

461
00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.130
Fantastic.

462
00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.700
You forged these weapons...

463
00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:17.630
...right here for the gods.
You must be able to help us.

464
00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:20.370
Shut it. How could I...

465
00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:22.010
...when I have no godly power anymore?

466
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:22.970
Who's he talking to?

467
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:24.540
Don't you...

468
00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:25.980
...walk away from me.

469
00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.880
His all-powerful father
took it away from me...

470
00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.920
...when I sided with Hades
in their little family argument.

471
00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:36.150
Yes, I know now it was a mistake.

472
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:38.560
People forget.

473
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:43.590
In the beginning, Hades was wise...

474
00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:47.570
...and just and strong.

475
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.270
It were your daddy became drunk on power.

476
00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:53.770
We were even hoping...

477
00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:58.440
...when Zeus came he might see
his mistake and restore our...

478
00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:01.920
Why not? He might have, had he come.

479
00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:09.690
I am sorry...

480
00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:12.850
...that you think being human
is not enough. But we humans...

481
00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:15.520
...hope when there's no hope.

482
00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:19.390
And we believe when to believe is idiotic.

483
00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:22.400
But sometimes, in spite...

484
00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.040
...of everything, we prevail.

485
00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:28.400
Now...

486
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:32.310
...which of you two...

487
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:34.240
...is in charge?

488
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:35.810
- I am.
- Then...

489
00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:40.190
...if we were gods...

490
00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.590
...how would you help us free Zeus?

491
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:46.930
Oh, my dear.

492
00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:50.500
You remind me of someone.

493
00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:55.200
Aphrodite.

494
00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:58.130
She was my wife.

495
00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:02.740
Come with me.

496
00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:05.680
If Zeus is captive in the underworld...

497
00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:08.980
...he's likely being held
in the heart of Tartarus.

498
00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:13.490
There can't be much time
before his life force...

499
00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:14.780
...is completely sapped.

500
00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:16.790
But how do we get to him?

501
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:18.320
We can't.

502
00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:20.360
Normally you'd be right, young man.

503
00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.300
But when I designed this marvel...

504
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:32.200
...I included a secret
passage, a shortcut...

505
00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.430
...if you will.

506
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:35.740
- You designed Tartarus?
- Oh, aye.

507
00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:37.800
And built it.

508
00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:40.470
Aphrodite, I could...

509
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:42.950
...not only get you inside...

510
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:46.490
...I could give you a guided tour.

511
00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:53.160
In order for the prison of Tartarus...

512
00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.560
...to be completely impregnable...

513
00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.670
...I built it from the outside in.

514
00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:01.670
So I had to leave a passage
for meself to get out...

515
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:04.700
...when the work was done.
And this labyrinth...

516
00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:08.070
...is the only way a human
can travel through the underworld...

517
00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:12.040
...and get to the heart of Tartarus.

518
00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:46.240
Where's my snarling bastard of a son Ares?

519
00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:50.180
Will Kronos really spare him?

520
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:52.280
And you?

521
00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:57.120
Is there no end to this?

522
00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:59.020
I am afraid, brother.

523
00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:02.390
Is that what you want me to say?
I am a god and I am afraid.

524
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:03.530
Well, you should be.

525
00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:08.330
When your precious humans die,
at least their souls go to another place.

526
00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:11.840
When a god dies, it isn't death.

527
00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:14.240
It's just absence.

528
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:16.970
It's nothing.

529
00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:21.250
It's oblivion.

530
00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:26.280
It's oblivion.

531
00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:30.580
Perseus.

532
00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:35.790
Perseus.

533
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:38.430
Father.

534
00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:42.300
I am close.

535
00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:44.260
Stay with me.

536
00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:47.130
You see, if you align
the edges correctly...

537
00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:50.010
...it gives you a shifting depiction
of the interior.

538
00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:51.970
Can I say, that is a masterpiece.

539
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:53.980
Well, useful to a point.

540
00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:56.740
Would you let a lowly navigator hold it?
No.

541
00:47:56.740 --> 00:48:00.150
Well, you are the son of Poseidon.

542
00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:04.860
He's the one who taught me to navigate.
That, and how to seduce a mermaid...

543
00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:07.430
...which seemed random,
but came in handy more often...

544
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:09.960
...than you'd think.
Thing to do is...

545
00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:12.970
...don't talk to her,
talk to her friend.

546
00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:19.670
Navigator, this is the entrance
to the labyrinth.

547
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:23.970
There are hundreds of doors,
all of which would kill you...

548
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:26.850
...save one. You see...

549
00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:28.450
...I designed it to play...

550
00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:31.020
...tricks with the mind.
After all, the mind...

551
00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:32.680
...is the greatest trap of all.

552
00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.820
So you have got to control your fears...

553
00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:38.480
...so you don't turn on yourself
or each other...

554
00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.860
...if you want to make it to Tartarus.

555
00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:49.730
There it is.

556
00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:51.700
There's our door.

557
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:57.340
Everybody back.

558
00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:08.150
Oh.

559
00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:10.820
Which one of you prayed to him?

560
00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:43.880
You betrayed our father.

561
00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:46.620
He betrayed me...

562
00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:48.920
...by choosing you.

563
00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:18.890
You beauty.

564
00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:23.430
Come on. It won't stay open...

565
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:24.620
...for long.

566
00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:37.970
No, not now.

567
00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:50.350
Great god Ares...

568
00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:53.430
...be merciful. It was I who prayed
to you. I was taught...

569
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.790
...to pray for my enemies.
I prayed you would find peace...

570
00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:59.200
...in your heart... Ah. Ah.

571
00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:06.510
We are brothers...

572
00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:08.300
...but not equal.

573
00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:16.140
I have got to give them more time.

574
00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.390
One last godly thing.

575
00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:29.660
Come on.

576
00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:32.630
Let's see what you blee....

577
00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:34.730
Perseus.

578
00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:38.330
Hephaestus.

579
00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:39.340
Aah.

580
00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:43.510
Perseus. The door's...

581
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:45.040
...closing. Come on.

582
00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.310
Ares.

583
00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:49.180
Is that all you got...

584
00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:50.320
...you sniveling...

585
00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:52.240
...dog?

586
00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:54.550
Get to the door.

587
00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:57.860
- Come on.
- Come on.

588
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:22.640
Oh, Korrina.

589
00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:26.410
She was a fool to pray to him...

590
00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:30.620
...and he was a coward to kill the weak.

591
00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:33.390
He has fought in many wars.

592
00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:35.760
He's slaughtered innocents for centuries.

593
00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:37.360
It's all...

594
00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:38.560
...he knows.

595
00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:41.290
I can't beat him.

596
00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:43.060
Mutton head.

597
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:46.800
Two days ago I was trapped in a cell
in a dungeon, admittedly...

598
00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:50.100
...trying to escape,
unbecoming of the son of Poseidon.

599
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:54.780
But today I am here,
and I am trying to save the universe.

600
00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:56.480
Jump in.

601
00:53:06.090 --> 00:53:07.320
Your Majesty...

602
00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:10.830
...I realize in a labyrinth
with a million possibilities...

603
00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:13.530
...this is the last thing
you want to hear but...

604
00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:16.200
...follow me.

605
00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:22.570
That way.

606
00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:28.150
Or this way.

607
00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:48.430
I don't know...

608
00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:50.630
...how we will get through this
without Hephaestus.

609
00:53:57.110 --> 00:53:58.880
Perseus.

610
00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:05.990
Where is your son?

611
00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:18.630
This way.

612
00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:26.030
That way.

613
00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.800
This way.

614
00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:01.330
Andromeda.

615
00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:04.510
Korrina.

616
00:55:05.410 --> 00:55:07.180
You must turn back.

617
00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:16.190
This should be...

618
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:18.520
...a corridor.
This map makes no sense.

619
00:55:18.730 --> 00:55:20.250
Andromeda.

620
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:26.130
There's something in here with us.

621
00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:30.600
- Just give me the map.
- No.

622
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:33.430
The mighty Kraken slayer.
Shouldn't he be somewhere...

623
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:35.270
...posing for a statue? Agenor...

624
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:38.410
...just give me the map.
The map is useless.

625
00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:48.080
This way.

626
00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:54.590
Agenor.

627
00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:59.260
I know where we're going.

628
00:56:06.070 --> 00:56:07.370
This way.

629
00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:19.450
Get back.

630
00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:29.150
Back.

631
00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:37.290
Get up.

632
00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:50.710
Andromeda.

633
00:56:57.020 --> 00:56:58.050
Yes.

634
00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:10.630
Take the weight.

635
00:57:16.310 --> 00:57:18.070
Come on, come on, come on.

636
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:23.080
Go, go.

637
00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:24.750
Go.

638
00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:12.630
It's cold in here, isn't it?

639
00:58:29.250 --> 00:58:31.080
You're not real.

640
00:58:31.590 --> 00:58:33.280
Helius?

641
01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:05.640
Why are you doing this?
Please, Dad, don't kill me.

642
01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:08.070
- Perseus.
- Perseus.

643
01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:09.800
What happened?

644
01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:17.370
Tartarus.

645
01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:21.240
Come on, let's go.

646
01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:23.390
Come on.

647
01:01:33.130 --> 01:01:36.230
Kronos has his power now.

648
01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.100
Hades.

649
01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:43.010
I am so sorry.

650
01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:45.000
For what?

651
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:47.240
For having banished you.

652
01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:51.150
Can you forgive me for that?

653
01:01:52.290 --> 01:01:53.910
Why do you ask?

654
01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:58.220
Because I forgive you for this.

655
01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.250
Release me, Hades.

656
01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:04.950
I know there is still good in you.

657
01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:15.740
You have no pride, Hades.

658
01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:17.940
No.

659
01:02:18.450 --> 01:02:21.110
I won't let you kill him.

660
01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:24.240
Brother.

661
01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:29.360
You can't stop this.

662
01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:47.640
Ares.

663
01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:20.840
Come on.

664
01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:29.450
Go, go.

665
01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:36.690
Father. Father.

666
01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:38.090
Father.

667
01:03:38.090 --> 01:03:39.420
Open your eyes.

668
01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:42.950
Perseus.

669
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:46.260
Perseus, my son.

670
01:04:04.550 --> 01:04:06.640
Use the power inside you.

671
01:04:32.810 --> 01:04:33.510
Perseus...

672
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:34.370
...hurry.

673
01:04:59.170 --> 01:05:00.760
Ares. Andromeda.

674
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:19.360
Hades...

675
01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:20.550
...come with us.

676
01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:47.550
No.

677
01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:52.880
Hades.......

678
01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:02.530
Weapon. Give it to me.

679
01:06:04.070 --> 01:06:05.370
Hold them.

680
01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:40.710
Mantius, impressive.

681
01:06:41.110 --> 01:06:44.540
- You gathered a fine army.
- I have prepared a royal tent.

682
01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:46.300
And is it fit for a god?

683
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:48.540
Great Zeus. Great Zeus.

684
01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:50.210
Great Zeus.

685
01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:56.980
Kronos...

686
01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:59.960
...will come for me, Perseus.

687
01:07:00.330 --> 01:07:02.730
I don't have the power left to stop him.

688
01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:06.820
I wanted...

689
01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:09.430
...to leave the world safe for you.
I failed.

690
01:07:10.270 --> 01:07:12.500
I should have come with you.

691
01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:14.160
- I was just...
- You pulled me...

692
01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.240
...out of Tartarus.

693
01:07:17.610 --> 01:07:18.910
You saved me.

694
01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.550
How do you suppose you did that?

695
01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:26.510
I never stopped thinking about
getting home to my son. Then...

696
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:29.550
...you use that.
Fight for your son.

697
01:07:30.590 --> 01:07:31.850
Remember:

698
01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:35.690
Only the Spear of Trium can defeat Kronos.

699
01:07:35.690 --> 01:07:38.420
And the hand that holds that spear
will have to be...

700
01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:39.660
...yours.

701
01:07:45.970 --> 01:07:48.570
We have two pieces of the Spear of Trium.

702
01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:51.610
Poseidon's trident...

703
01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.470
...and Hades' pitchfork.

704
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:56.980
So, what we need is Zeus' thunderbolt.

705
01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:58.670
Which is on Ares' back.

706
01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:02.880
Yep.

707
01:08:04.890 --> 01:08:06.020
Ares.

708
01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:08.720
Ares.

709
01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:10.520
Ares.

710
01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:12.900
Brother.

711
01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:16.630
I pray to you.

712
01:08:17.970 --> 01:08:20.410
Meet me at the temple of the gods.

713
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:24.840
You say we're not equal.

714
01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:28.580
So come prove to me...

715
01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:29.740
...you're right.

716
01:08:33.390 --> 01:08:36.510
Prove to our father that you're right.

717
01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:40.250
I hear you, brother.

718
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:49.260
I will get the spear.
You hold him off.

719
01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:57.510
Don't give me the big speech.

720
01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:00.210
Yeah, I wasn't planning to.

721
01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:24.530
Our battle plan...

722
01:09:25.170 --> 01:09:26.230
...must be simple.

723
01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:27.900
Three lines of defense:

724
01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:30.130
Agenor's men will hold the front line...

725
01:09:30.130 --> 01:09:31.400
...from the trenches.

726
01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.440
Cover every part...

727
01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:34.410
...of yourself, or you will be burned...

728
01:09:34.410 --> 01:09:35.710
...by the fire.

729
01:09:35.710 --> 01:09:37.540
Every piece of cloth...

730
01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:40.210
...every piece of skin. Help each other.

731
01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:41.550
Phalanxes behind that...

732
01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:43.810
...and infantry as the last defense.

733
01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:46.180
I will lead the infantry myself.

734
01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:48.150
And our job...

735
01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:51.590
...is to hold Kronos back
for as long as possible...

736
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:53.890
...if we're to stand a chance.

737
01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:57.570
- Dig in.
- Position.

738
01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.330
Secure positions.

739
01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:47.480
Kronos is near.

740
01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.300
Makhai.

741
01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:05.760
Makhai.

742
01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:19.550
Light the fires.

743
01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:23.050
- Light the fires.
- Light the fires.

744
01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:27.520
Hold.

745
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:34.920
Fire the artillery.

746
01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.420
Loose.

747
01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:40.170
Fire.

748
01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:15.270
Brother.

749
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:28.620
Brother.

750
01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:34.260
- Please don't hurt him.
- I am not going to hurt him.

751
01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:35.930
I am going to hurt you.

752
01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:38.260
And I want him to watch.

753
01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:40.790
I want you to know...

754
01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:42.990
...what it feels like...

755
01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:46.970
...when someone takes your
father away from you.

756
01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:13.490
Front line, attack.

757
01:14:14.090 --> 01:14:14.960
Stay with me.

758
01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:17.150
Stand firm.

759
01:15:12.450 --> 01:15:13.940
So this is what a father...

760
01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:16.280
...would go through for his son?

761
01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:45.110
Brother.

762
01:15:47.450 --> 01:15:48.780
Brother.

763
01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.790
I do...

764
01:15:52.930 --> 01:15:54.590
...forgive you.

765
01:16:18.150 --> 01:16:18.810
You look...

766
01:16:18.810 --> 01:16:21.220
...10,000 years younger.

767
01:16:21.690 --> 01:16:22.850
And feel it.

768
01:16:28.230 --> 01:16:31.130
Death was circling you.

769
01:16:31.630 --> 01:16:34.860
That was the last time I will have
the strength to chase it away.

770
01:16:36.970 --> 01:16:37.870
We have the power...

771
01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:41.700
...between us to put on a little display.

772
01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:42.860
Like in the old days.

773
01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:45.140
So shall we finish this?

774
01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:46.210
We have no weapons.

775
01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:48.210
We had power before we had weapons.

776
01:16:48.210 --> 01:16:50.180
- When we were young gods.
- Yes.

777
01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:52.240
Let's have some fun.

778
01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:17.790
Helius. Weapons.

779
01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:38.580
Hold the line. Hold the line.

780
01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:40.010
Stand firm.

781
01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:56.530
The Spear of Trium.

782
01:20:10.450 --> 01:20:13.170
Hades.......

783
01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:21.830
Zeus.....

784
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:23.850
The first strike's mine, brother.

785
01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:03.060
Perseus.

786
01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:15.070
Together now, brother.

787
01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:36.520
This is it, boy.
They have given us a chance.

788
01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:04.120
Brother.

789
01:24:07.050 --> 01:24:08.640
Come on, stand up.

790
01:24:22.330 --> 01:24:25.790
Perseus. Perseus. Perseus.

791
01:25:00.670 --> 01:25:02.500
He's waiting for you...

792
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:05.710
...before he goes.

793
01:25:27.670 --> 01:25:29.900
Your boy gave you strength.

794
01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:32.400
Yes.

795
01:25:33.570 --> 01:25:35.340
As did mine.

796
01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:42.370
Perhaps Hades can heal you.

797
01:25:42.710 --> 01:25:44.910
He already gave me my last chance.

798
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:52.550
And you sacrificed it for him.

799
01:25:54.090 --> 01:25:56.760
There will be no more sacrifices.

800
01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:00.460
No more gods.

801
01:26:05.470 --> 01:26:08.740
Use your power wisely, Perseus.

802
01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:29.630
Thank you, my son.

803
01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:01.590
All my power is spent.

804
01:27:05.230 --> 01:27:06.660
Who knows?

805
01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:10.960
I might be stronger without it.

806
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:28.480
I know it's broke. No need to tell me.

807
01:27:28.690 --> 01:27:31.050
I could walk on it, but....
My mum always said...

808
01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:34.490
...you should let everyone have
their moment to shine. You know?

809
01:27:34.490 --> 01:27:37.630
So, you know, I am established.
I have already got a name.

810
01:27:37.630 --> 01:27:40.360
You know? The Navigator.

811
01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:44.660
If I am not mistaken...

812
01:27:45.370 --> 01:27:48.310
...you're the son of Perseus.
I am Helius.

813
01:27:48.510 --> 01:27:50.870
Is that your boy, Helius?

814
01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:01.280
Go over there.

815
01:28:03.190 --> 01:28:04.180
Helius.

816
01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:05.720
Come here.

817
01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:08.050
I have got a story to tell.
Come and meet...

818
01:28:08.050 --> 01:28:09.890
...your Uncle Navigator.

819
01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:21.340
I am Agenor.

820
01:28:21.670 --> 01:28:23.000
Helius.

821
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.440
I have read that you are
a great disappointment.

822
01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:28.850
That's right, I am great.

823
01:28:28.850 --> 01:28:31.040
This is my nurse, Tiger.

824
01:28:45.130 --> 01:28:47.390
We have to be prepared
if there's another attack.

825
01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:49.730
We're fortifying Argos
with the third regiment.

826
01:28:49.730 --> 01:28:53.030
Our engines will be ready in two days,
so in the west we can...

827
01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:13.390
Dad...

828
01:29:14.290 --> 01:29:16.960
...I am actually looking forward
to going home.

829
01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:21.960
I have decided being a boring fisherman
isn't that bad.

830
01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:24.930
You know we can't go back home.

831
01:29:41.890 --> 01:29:43.120
Take it.

832
01:29:48.090 --> 01:29:49.650
You're Helius.

833
01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:53.660
You're son of Perseus...

834
01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:56.090
...the grandson of Zeus.

835
01:29:59.270 --> 01:30:00.470
Take it.

836
01:30:11.450 --> 01:30:12.780
It's heavy.

837
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:15.350
Yeah, it is.

838
01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:19.650
Is it too much?

839
01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:28.460
No.
