<font color="#00ffff"><i>In ancient times,</i></font>

00:00:38.352 --> 00:00:40.395
<font color="#00ffff"><i>the world was ruled by Gods</i></font>

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.159

7

<font color="#00ffff"><i>I offered him a place

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:01.112
<font color="#00ffff"><i>But Perseus was strong-willed</i></font>

00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:03.443
<font color="#00ffff"><i>and chose a different path.</i></font>

10
00:01:03.692 --> 00:01:06.582
<font color="#00ffff"><i>He vowed to live, as a man.</i></font>

11
00:01:08.768 --> 00:01:10.640
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Even when fate took his wife,</i></font>

12
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.836

00:01:13.432 --> 00:01:14.366
<font color="#00ffff"><i>from me,</i></font>

14
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.915
<font color="#00ffff"><i>or the other Gods.</i></font>

15
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.204
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And now the time of the Gods is ending.</i></font>

16
00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:24.529
<font color="#00ffff"><i>But the son of Zeus cannot hide
from his destiny forever.</i></font>

17
00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:29.888
Now pull it in. Pull it in.
Do it again.

18
00:01:29.931 --> 00:01:32.324
Throw in the other one real quick.
Go on. I will tie this off.

19
00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.646
Good catch today, Dad.

20
00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:44.301
Where'd you get that?

21
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.727
I made it myself.

22
00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.115
You made it yourself?

23
00:01:52.668 --> 00:01:54.829
I want to be a good God
and do good things.

24
00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:56.484
There's no such thing as good Gods.

25
00:01:56.486 --> 00:01:57.696
Some of them are good.

26
00:01:58.613 --> 00:02:01.681
Helius, there is more to life
than Gods and Titans.

27
00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:03.426
Hey, Clea.

28
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.288
I have a confession to make.

29
00:02:05.726 --> 00:02:08.372
I, needed him for chores
so he skipped studying.

30
00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.412
Now, you do a good job,

31
00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:13.039
make me proud.

32
00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.882
I know you're here.

33
00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.981
I visit him sometimes in his dreams.

34
00:02:48.433 --> 00:02:49.693
He's like his father.

35
00:02:49.695 --> 00:02:51.058
A strong-willed boy.

36
00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:53.635
You just passing through?

37
00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:57.474
No.

38
00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:00.520
I need your help Perseus.

39
00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:04.204
You're the great God Zeus.
You don't need my help.

40
00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:07.094
There is a calamity coming.

41
00:03:07.663 --> 00:03:08.957
It will affect us all.

42
00:03:09.217 --> 00:03:10.938
Gods and men.

43
00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:13.381
The humans may have
stopped praying to us.

44
00:03:13.383 --> 00:03:14.391
With good reason.

45
00:03:14.641 --> 00:03:16.201
But there are consequences.

46
00:03:17.163 --> 00:03:19.407
Without prayer,
we Gods lose our power.

47
00:03:19.735 --> 00:03:22.882
When our power leaves us,
all our work comes undone.

48
00:03:23.417 --> 00:03:24.445
All of it.

49
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.441
The walls of Tartarus are falling.

50
00:03:37.183 --> 00:03:39.603
It is emptying all its demons
onto the earth.

51
00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.602
The first are already here.

52
00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.038
If our power
diminishes much further,

53
00:03:45.116 --> 00:03:46.869
we Gods will become mortal.

54
00:03:47.322 --> 00:03:49.920
We will die and Kronos
himself will escape.

55
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.061
It will mean chaos.

56
00:03:52.704 --> 00:03:54.089
The end of the world.

57
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.087
What am I meant to do?

58
00:03:58.137 --> 00:03:59.544
This is business for Gods.

59
00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.573
We need all our children now.

60
00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:03.114
Perhaps,

61
00:04:03.377 --> 00:04:05.127
together we can remedy this.

62
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.642
But we need every shred of power,
Perseus.

63
00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.178
I will never leave my son.

64
00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:19.331
I know your heart better
than you know it yourself.

65
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.882
You believe your human half
makes you unworthy to join us.

66
00:04:24.664 --> 00:04:27.029
You will learn someday
that being half-human,

67
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.778
makes you stronger than a God,

68
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.869
not weaker.

69
00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:33.844
I think you should go.

70
00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:38.725
Sleep well, Perseus.

71
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:30.051
<i>I will never leave my son.</i>

72
00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:33.157
<i>Zeus.</i>

73
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.883
Poseidon.

74
00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:44.167
Brother.

75
00:06:46.773 --> 00:06:48.263
It has been an age.

76
00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:50.921
Indeed, it has.

77
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.123
Ares.

78
00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:57.231
My son.

79
00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:00.709
Where's my brother Perseus?

80
00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:03.970
Gone fishing?

81
00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:06.092
Yes.

82
00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.258
What a brave and noble decision.

83
00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:17.857
Let us go, then.

84
00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:33.327
Tartarus.

85
00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:36.009
The great prison of the underworld.

86
00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:41.699
Brother Hades.

87
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.588
We have come to your domain,

88
00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:47.478
as agreed.

89
00:07:48.267 --> 00:07:49.757
Show yourself to us.

90
00:07:58.244 --> 00:08:00.304
After so many years...

91
00:08:00.746 --> 00:08:02.449
the sons of Kronos,

92
00:08:02.762 --> 00:08:04.527
together once more.

93
00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:06.276
Brothers in arms.

94
00:08:06.662 --> 00:08:07.744
Hades...

95
00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:12.210
you are the great ruler
of the underworld.

96
00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:14.690
Allow us to enter,

97
00:08:14.884 --> 00:08:17.636
and help you rebuild
the walls of Tartarus.

98
00:08:18.884 --> 00:08:20.220
My beloved brother,

99
00:08:20.755 --> 00:08:24.425
who banished me here for eternity
to look after our father,

100
00:08:25.018 --> 00:08:27.584
now seeks reconciliation.

101
00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:31.581
We must forget the past brother,

102
00:08:31.824 --> 00:08:32.856
and unite.

103
00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:38.926
Yes.

104
00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:41.267
But on my terms.

105
00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:46.586
Poseidon.

106
00:08:57.403 --> 00:08:58.432
Above you.

107
00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:06.830
Poseidon.

108
00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:27.254
It has begun.

109
00:10:10.121 --> 00:10:11.305
Helius?

110
00:10:12.678 --> 00:10:13.736
Helius.

111
00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:20.063
Stay away, stay away.

112
00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:27.106
Helius?

113
00:10:27.493 --> 00:10:28.282
Helius.

114
00:10:56.422 --> 00:10:57.548
Chimera.

115
00:11:05.531 --> 00:11:06.562
Helius.

116
00:11:08.932 --> 00:11:10.222
Have you seen Helius?

117
00:11:13.806 --> 00:11:14.771
Helius.

118
00:11:16.742 --> 00:11:17.504
Get back.

119
00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:21.739
Keep away.
Its venom catches fire.

120
00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:25.201
Stay down.

121
00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:55.768
Helius, go with them.

122
00:11:59.985 --> 00:12:01.093
Take him.

123
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.680
I will find you. Go.

124
00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:07.423
Go.

125
00:12:15.073 --> 00:12:16.061
Dad.
Run.

126
00:12:16.366 --> 00:12:17.204
Go.

127
00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:20.077
Helius.

128
00:12:24.171 --> 00:12:25.044
Helius.

129
00:12:29.548 --> 00:12:31.532
Dad, hurry.
I am coming, son.

130
00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:35.810
Helius. Stay there.

131
00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:41.250
Dad.

132
00:12:50.636 --> 00:12:51.537
Helius.

133
00:12:52.671 --> 00:12:53.563
Here.

134
00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:55.066
Come and get me.

135
00:14:07.646 --> 00:14:09.306
What are you waiting for?

136
00:14:09.613 --> 00:14:10.734
Burn me.

137
00:14:46.195 --> 00:14:47.930
Things are happening
in the world, Perseus.

138
00:14:47.932 --> 00:14:49.682
You know that, you have instincts.

139
00:14:50.006 --> 00:14:51.425
The son of a God.

140
00:14:54.293 --> 00:14:55.850
A son needs a father.

141
00:14:56.929 --> 00:14:58.388
I made a vow to lo.

142
00:14:58.389 --> 00:15:02.018
I know, I know,
I was there delivering your son.

143
00:15:02.743 --> 00:15:05.563
You vowed to your wife you'd
never let Helius wield a sword.

144
00:15:05.564 --> 00:15:07.898
That you'd live with him
as a simple fisherman.

145
00:15:08.644 --> 00:15:09.485
Well,

146
00:15:10.273 --> 00:15:12.316
that's a fine game in normal times.

147
00:15:13.212 --> 00:15:15.717
But if you have power,
you also have a duty.

148
00:15:17.616 --> 00:15:19.042
Just fix my body...

149
00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:21.425
and leave my soul to me.

150
00:15:27.983 --> 00:15:29.273
Where are we going?

151
00:15:30.996 --> 00:15:32.763
I need to speak to my father.

152
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:35.884
There's nothing to be frightened of.

153
00:15:41.573 --> 00:15:43.303
This is the Mount of Idols.

154
00:15:43.859 --> 00:15:45.651
The closest place to the heavens.

155
00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:48.887
It's a place where people come
to worship the Gods.

156
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.013
Or at least they used to come.

157
00:15:56.155 --> 00:15:57.231
Zeus?

158
00:16:06.932 --> 00:16:08.125
Father.

159
00:16:29.555 --> 00:16:30.590
Poseidon.

160
00:16:31.056 --> 00:16:32.147
What happened?

161
00:16:32.277 --> 00:16:33.665
Hades and Ares,

162
00:16:33.877 --> 00:16:36.572
have joined Kronos, against humanity.

163
00:16:37.963 --> 00:16:39.643
All the Gods have disappeared.

164
00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:41.414
I fear the worst.

165
00:16:41.639 --> 00:16:42.962
Here, here.

166
00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:45.670
I got you, I got you.

167
00:16:49.475 --> 00:16:50.622
Where's my father?

168
00:16:51.393 --> 00:16:52.287
Captured.

169
00:16:52.978 --> 00:16:54.574
You must journey to the underworld

170
00:16:54.708 --> 00:16:55.780
and free him.

171
00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:58.100
They took my father.

172
00:16:58.432 --> 00:17:00.460
You're the only hope left in this world.

173
00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:02.820
Or there will be oblivion.

174
00:17:09.328 --> 00:17:10.569
How do I do it?

175
00:17:11.691 --> 00:17:13.022
I am only half a God.

176
00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:15.038
Then you must find another half-God.

177
00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:17.318
Agenor.

178
00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:19.331
He's my son.

179
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.276
He's with Queen Andromeda.

180
00:17:28.242 --> 00:17:29.937
Tell him to take you to the Fallen One.

181
00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:34.404
Poseidon.

182
00:17:40.423 --> 00:17:41.981
Take this. Use it.

183
00:17:43.006 --> 00:17:45.566
And if my son survives
and proves worthy...

184
00:17:46.832 --> 00:17:48.023
give it to him.

185
00:18:24.403 --> 00:18:26.141
My own son betrays me.

186
00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:28.851
Only when it suits you,

187
00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:30.750
you remember I am your son.

188
00:18:32.177 --> 00:18:33.066
Hades.

189
00:18:33.163 --> 00:18:35.165
You're sweating like a human, brother.

190
00:18:35.596 --> 00:18:37.131
Next, it will be tears.

191
00:18:37.371 --> 00:18:39.009
Don't waste words on him.

192
00:18:39.384 --> 00:18:40.344
Kronos...

193
00:18:40.917 --> 00:18:43.098
is waiting, Father.

194
00:18:44.923 --> 00:18:45.801
What?

195
00:18:46.405 --> 00:18:48.622
Our father has offered us a deal.

196
00:18:48.846 --> 00:18:50.100
You fool.

197
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.659
If we help him to escape Tartarus,

198
00:18:53.791 --> 00:18:56.550
he will allow we few
Gods who remain to keep,

199
00:18:56.552 --> 00:18:57.926
our immortality.

200
00:18:58.132 --> 00:18:59.680
No.

201
00:18:59.682 --> 00:19:00.783
Let him speak.

202
00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:02.500
Let him speak.

203
00:19:04.042 --> 00:19:05.452
Are you becoming weak?

204
00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:07.559
You're in the underworld, Ares,

205
00:19:07.561 --> 00:19:09.730
where it's wise to obey me.

206
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.411
You forget our father
once tried to kill us.

207
00:19:15.749 --> 00:19:17.682
No, I remember everything.

208
00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.726
And what exactly

209
00:19:19.728 --> 00:19:23.354
does our father want from us in
return for our precious immortality?

210
00:19:23.355 --> 00:19:26.752
We simply offer him
the last of your divine powers

211
00:19:26.754 --> 00:19:28.797
so that he may free himself.

212
00:19:31.436 --> 00:19:32.542
Oh, Hades.

213
00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.527
What have I done to you?

214
00:19:46.985 --> 00:19:48.821
You laugh as if you had a choice.

215
00:19:49.132 --> 00:19:50.387
There is no choice.

216
00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.640
I hope you have enough of them.

217
00:19:57.764 --> 00:19:58.594
Pull him.

218
00:20:21.273 --> 00:20:22.604
You will need it more than me.

219
00:20:27.693 --> 00:20:28.785
Pegasus.

220
00:20:34.499 --> 00:20:35.507
Go on.

221
00:20:49.201 --> 00:20:50.318
He likes you.

222
00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.210
Me, on the other hand...

223
00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:02.324
I love you.

224
00:21:02.628 --> 00:21:03.890
I know.

225
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.358
Come on.

226
00:21:12.477 --> 00:21:14.144
Go head, keep it straight.

227
00:21:15.293 --> 00:21:16.525
Have it look good.

228
00:21:46.605 --> 00:21:47.833
Come on, boy.

229
00:21:50.776 --> 00:21:52.375
More Chimera.

230
00:21:52.666 --> 00:21:54.088
Archers.

231
00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:55.541
Go, go, go.

232
00:21:55.974 --> 00:21:58.480
Ready. Fire.

233
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.314
Chimera.
Ready.

234
00:22:04.856 --> 00:22:06.745
Hold your lines. Hold your lines.

235
00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.018
Out of the way.

236
00:22:10.462 --> 00:22:12.327
Hold your fire.

237
00:22:12.864 --> 00:22:15.727
I said hold your fire.
Queen Andromeda.

238
00:22:16.368 --> 00:22:17.637
Keep it straight.

239
00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:19.031
Oy.

240
00:22:32.417 --> 00:22:34.146
You used to be a lot better at this.

241
00:22:36.655 --> 00:22:38.872
All hail Perseus,

242
00:22:39.061 --> 00:22:41.091
killer of the Kraken.

243
00:22:41.626 --> 00:22:43.418
Hail Perseus.

244
00:22:48.333 --> 00:22:49.791
Great Perseus.

245
00:22:50.869 --> 00:22:52.756
If it is action you're after,

246
00:22:52.915 --> 00:22:54.389
you are a little late.

247
00:22:54.985 --> 00:22:56.372
I am just here,

248
00:22:56.374 --> 00:22:57.653
to see Queen Andromeda.

249
00:22:57.849 --> 00:22:59.439
This is a battlefield.

250
00:22:59.861 --> 00:23:01.470
I am in command here.

251
00:23:03.248 --> 00:23:05.044
Well, I wish to speak to the queen.

252
00:23:05.216 --> 00:23:07.239
And the queen wishes
to speak to you.

253
00:23:09.499 --> 00:23:10.727
Your Majesty.

254
00:23:12.858 --> 00:23:13.892
Come on.

255
00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:16.555
Hail Perseus.

256
00:23:28.173 --> 00:23:30.459
You have obviously been
in your own battles, Perseus.

257
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:33.678
I have been busy with mine.

258
00:23:34.312 --> 00:23:35.478
Yeah, you have.

259
00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.606
I won't keep you.

260
00:23:46.391 --> 00:23:47.597
It's been too long.

261
00:23:51.763 --> 00:23:53.421
I have a son now.
I know.

262
00:23:53.423 --> 00:23:54.687
I'd like to meet him.

263
00:23:56.401 --> 00:23:58.051
And my wife, she...
I know.

264
00:23:59.237 --> 00:24:00.327
I am sorry.

265
00:24:02.207 --> 00:24:03.306
Your Majesty.

266
00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:07.450
For the sake of the men,

267
00:24:07.652 --> 00:24:10.145
we must resolve our
differences before sunset.

268
00:24:10.369 --> 00:24:13.574
I made it clear we continue to fight
the Chimera invaders.

269
00:24:13.841 --> 00:24:18.474
Today in the field we lost 300 men
for the death of four Chimera.

270
00:24:18.805 --> 00:24:20.759
We have offended the Gods.

271
00:24:21.441 --> 00:24:22.697
We need to pray.

272
00:24:23.145 --> 00:24:24.585
You'd pray to Ares, perhaps?

273
00:24:24.664 --> 00:24:26.469
As soldiers always have.

274
00:24:27.332 --> 00:24:29.925
What if I was to tell you that Ares
is your enemy now?

275
00:24:30.043 --> 00:24:31.651
I would make peace with him.

276
00:24:32.237 --> 00:24:34.428
You would make peace
with the God of war?

277
00:24:35.716 --> 00:24:36.657
Perseus.

278
00:24:37.342 --> 00:24:39.139
What's your strategy?

279
00:24:41.513 --> 00:24:44.141
There's a way we can end this,
and then I can get home.

280
00:24:44.649 --> 00:24:45.865
What is this for?

281
00:24:45.938 --> 00:24:49.001
It's to cut the oars my trireme
170 oars

282
00:24:49.105 --> 00:24:50.942
for the three rows one oar per man.

283
00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:52.836
This looks like a pick.

284
00:24:52.931 --> 00:24:54.139
It is however,

285
00:24:54.141 --> 00:24:55.826
the rudder for my flagship.
Quiet.

286
00:24:55.994 --> 00:24:57.719
Morning checks, Your Majesty.

287
00:24:58.568 --> 00:25:00.309
Always eventful.

288
00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:02.309
Oh, Your Majesty.

289
00:25:02.311 --> 00:25:03.790
So good to see you.

290
00:25:03.791 --> 00:25:04.987
This is Agenor.

291
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.837
He's a liar and a thief.

292
00:25:06.839 --> 00:25:08.535
I know it didn't work out between us but...

293
00:25:08.676 --> 00:25:10.427
please, do try and get over it.

294
00:25:10.536 --> 00:25:13.325
Have you ever had a woman
love you so much,

295
00:25:13.447 --> 00:25:15.039
she locks you up like a pet rabbit?

296
00:25:15.214 --> 00:25:16.668
He wanted my hand in marriage.

297
00:25:16.976 --> 00:25:18.429
When I refused,

298
00:25:18.431 --> 00:25:20.183
he tried to run away
with the crown jewels.

299
00:25:20.384 --> 00:25:22.549
I think it's my extraordinary eyes.

300
00:25:22.625 --> 00:25:24.754
Actually, you got the eyes of your father.

301
00:25:27.631 --> 00:25:28.890
Do you know his father?

302
00:25:30.104 --> 00:25:31.429
Yeah, Agenor here...

303
00:25:32.428 --> 00:25:34.396
he's the son of the great God Poseidon.

304
00:25:36.625 --> 00:25:39.982
Your new boyfriend is clearly insane.

305
00:25:40.069 --> 00:25:41.667
I am your cousin, Agenor.

306
00:25:42.967 --> 00:25:44.127
I am the son of Zeus.

307
00:25:44.431 --> 00:25:46.905
Half-God and abandoned just like you.

308
00:25:49.814 --> 00:25:52.559
If my father sent you,
I want nothing to do with you.

309
00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:55.193
Your father is dead.

310
00:25:56.888 --> 00:25:58.093
Gods don't die.

311
00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:00.044
They do now.

312
00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:01.407
Good.

313
00:26:01.594 --> 00:26:02.614
Could you do me a favor?

314
00:26:02.616 --> 00:26:04.277
Anything.
Go to hell.

315
00:26:06.097 --> 00:26:07.860
That's exactly where I am going.

316
00:26:10.936 --> 00:26:12.493
I just need information.

317
00:26:14.232 --> 00:26:17.721
Your father told me that you could
help me get to the Fallen One.

318
00:26:25.019 --> 00:26:27.214
You long for the ocean,
don't you Agenor?

319
00:26:28.086 --> 00:26:30.475
It's like a thirst you cannot quench.

320
00:26:32.891 --> 00:26:34.772
It must be hell for you in here.

321
00:26:43.134 --> 00:26:44.628
I want a royal pardon.

322
00:26:47.973 --> 00:26:48.962
Granted.

323
00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:51.742
I want my body weight in gold.

324
00:26:53.078 --> 00:26:54.136
Granted.

325
00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.325
Few gold coins, you're so scrawny.

326
00:26:57.729 --> 00:27:01.143
Oh let me see what else have
I dreamt of as I lay here in my cell?

327
00:27:01.145 --> 00:27:02.118
Don't push it.

328
00:27:04.122 --> 00:27:06.421
I am going to need a boat,
your fastest boat.

329
00:27:06.832 --> 00:27:09.264
The Fallen One lives far
across the ocean.

330
00:27:10.132 --> 00:27:10.860
Where?

331
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.931
Well, put me on the deck of the boat
and I will show you.

332
00:27:20.138 --> 00:27:21.332
Your ship awaits.

333
00:27:21.773 --> 00:27:23.870
Fetch my lucky cape.

334
00:27:27.012 --> 00:27:29.613
Do you know why
this is my lucky cape, me old mate?

335
00:27:29.981 --> 00:27:32.881
Because the first time I wore it,
I sprouted a beard.

336
00:27:33.041 --> 00:27:34.139
A full-grown beard.

337
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:38.691
Send word to every regiment that's still
intact to gather here at the Tyrene pass.

338
00:27:39.991 --> 00:27:42.443
If I am not there in two days...

339
00:27:43.528 --> 00:27:44.812
then you can pray.

340
00:27:45.964 --> 00:27:47.146
Your Majesty.

341
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.996
Regroup at the garrison.

342
00:27:50.722 --> 00:27:52.563
You can't leave Greece without a queen.

343
00:27:54.539 --> 00:27:56.083
Are you giving me orders now?

344
00:28:10.989 --> 00:28:12.120
Unchain him.

345
00:28:19.897 --> 00:28:21.489
Show me where the Fallen One is.

346
00:28:22.567 --> 00:28:24.084
Who is the Fallen One?

347
00:28:25.747 --> 00:28:27.633
The God Hephaestus.

348
00:28:29.986 --> 00:28:31.645
And who's Hephaestus?

349
00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:35.830
Hephaestus was the God
that made Poseidon's trident,

350
00:28:36.748 --> 00:28:38.243
Hades' pitchfork,

351
00:28:38.716 --> 00:28:40.206
and Zeus' thunderbolt.

352
00:28:41.332 --> 00:28:42.457
Put those together,

353
00:28:42.612 --> 00:28:44.309
they form the Spear of Trium,

354
00:28:44.824 --> 00:28:47.064
the weapon the Gods used
to defeat Kronos.

355
00:28:47.257 --> 00:28:49.125
But Hephaestus lives
on the island of Kail.

356
00:28:50.522 --> 00:28:51.885
Which no one has ever found.

357
00:28:52.697 --> 00:28:54.043
Kail doesn't exist,

358
00:28:54.739 --> 00:28:55.825
does it Agenor?

359
00:28:58.365 --> 00:29:00.496
It does exist and I can take you there.

360
00:29:01.277 --> 00:29:02.780
Unchain me and give me the trident.

361
00:29:02.803 --> 00:29:05.405
If you unchain him, he will jump off
this boat, you will never see him again.

362
00:29:06.031 --> 00:29:07.956
Hephaestus can help you save your father.

363
00:29:29.768 --> 00:29:31.216
Don't let our family down.

364
00:29:59.297 --> 00:30:01.379
Never doubted you
for a second, Agenor.

365
00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:38.586
Great Kronos.

366
00:30:39.266 --> 00:30:40.334
Father.

367
00:30:40.738 --> 00:30:43.880
We have delivered Zeus, your son...

368
00:30:46.311 --> 00:30:47.631
as you ordered.

369
00:30:48.413 --> 00:30:49.663
Zeus.

370
00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.397
Island of Kail.

371
00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:13.909
I am not touching that again.

372
00:31:33.858 --> 00:31:34.916
What is it?

373
00:31:35.426 --> 00:31:36.514
I don't know.

374
00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.083
But whoever did this
doesn't want us here.

375
00:31:39.262 --> 00:31:40.465
We have no choice.

376
00:31:41.151 --> 00:31:43.524
Fallen God has to live as close
to the heavens as possible.

377
00:31:43.525 --> 00:31:44.881
Streams run through here.

378
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:46.469
Higher ground's that way.

379
00:32:14.132 --> 00:32:15.834
What?
Look.

380
00:32:16.634 --> 00:32:17.941
Don't move.

381
00:32:26.696 --> 00:32:27.785
I can't see nothing.

382
00:32:27.976 --> 00:32:29.431
We should pray to the God of war.
Warriors.

383
00:32:30.171 --> 00:32:31.465
I know it is your custom,

384
00:32:32.185 --> 00:32:33.822
but no matter what we're about to face,

385
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:36.169
you do not pray Ares.

386
00:32:37.018 --> 00:32:37.958
If you do,

387
00:32:38.686 --> 00:32:40.641
he will find us and kill us all.

388
00:32:41.345 --> 00:32:42.352
Close in.

389
00:32:43.261 --> 00:32:44.562
Stay alert.

390
00:32:52.437 --> 00:32:53.309
Trip wire.

391
00:32:55.025 --> 00:32:56.565
Agenor.
Yeah, yeah. Saw it.

392
00:33:03.247 --> 00:33:04.673
The most important thing,

393
00:33:05.112 --> 00:33:06.192
is to do nothing.

394
00:33:06.783 --> 00:33:08.114
Nothing, I can do well.

395
00:33:11.356 --> 00:33:13.000
For the love of Zeus.

396
00:33:13.367 --> 00:33:14.844
I told you to do nothing.

397
00:33:14.846 --> 00:33:16.603
I didn't do anything.
Just stay still.

398
00:33:18.396 --> 00:33:19.556
No, no, no, no.

399
00:33:23.217 --> 00:33:24.241
Cut the counterweights.

400
00:33:27.305 --> 00:33:29.205
Don't cut the counterweight.

401
00:33:29.407 --> 00:33:30.986
Yeah, he's right, the fall will kill him.

402
00:33:44.288 --> 00:33:46.205
Cut the counterweight.

403
00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:48.418
Cut the counterweight.

404
00:33:55.124 --> 00:33:56.187
Agenor.

405
00:33:56.635 --> 00:33:58.085
Cut the counterweight.

406
00:33:58.087 --> 00:33:59.937
Cut the counterweight.

407
00:34:00.238 --> 00:34:01.364
Agenor.

408
00:34:05.176 --> 00:34:06.452
Agenor.

409
00:34:31.235 --> 00:34:33.011
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

410
00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:36.172
Stay down.

411
00:34:39.792 --> 00:34:40.622
What is it?

412
00:34:40.845 --> 00:34:41.723
Big.

413
00:34:41.783 --> 00:34:43.370
Andromeda, slow him down.

414
00:34:56.814 --> 00:34:57.473
Now.

415
00:34:57.662 --> 00:34:59.289
Archers.

416
00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:01.066
Galenos give him support.

417
00:35:01.068 --> 00:35:02.686
You, follow me.

418
00:35:16.203 --> 00:35:16.900
No.

419
00:35:53.291 --> 00:35:55.350
I pray to you, great God Ares.
I pray to you...

420
00:36:03.543 --> 00:36:04.613
Is it gone?

421
00:36:23.514 --> 00:36:24.742
Hey.

422
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:27.119
This is going to be a bad idea.

423
00:37:38.815 --> 00:37:40.269
Where's my cousin?

424
00:37:53.099 --> 00:37:54.497
Glad you're hanging in there.

425
00:37:54.569 --> 00:37:56.511
Yeah, I thought I'd give him an eyeful.

426
00:37:58.843 --> 00:38:00.174
What was that for?

427
00:38:02.113 --> 00:38:03.546
Poseidon.

428
00:38:27.609 --> 00:38:28.671
Poor Ares,

429
00:38:29.063 --> 00:38:30.990
always following orders.

430
00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:34.210
I am my own master.

431
00:38:34.612 --> 00:38:36.512
Yes, of course you are.

432
00:38:37.882 --> 00:38:40.568
Perhaps it's only humans
that have free will.

433
00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:47.075
There.

434
00:38:48.859 --> 00:38:49.693
Pain.

435
00:38:49.996 --> 00:38:51.845
Your lesson in being human.

436
00:38:52.397 --> 00:38:53.663
Why don't you weep?

437
00:38:53.864 --> 00:38:55.830
Why don't you weep like
your favorite son, Perseus?

438
00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:00.897
If I weep,

439
00:39:01.593 --> 00:39:04.040
it will be for you, Ares.

440
00:39:05.976 --> 00:39:06.913
Ares.

441
00:39:07.899 --> 00:39:08.705
Enough.

442
00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.469
Weep for your son.

443
00:39:11.674 --> 00:39:14.347
I said enough.

444
00:39:14.614 --> 00:39:16.393
We are in this together, Hades.

445
00:39:16.812 --> 00:39:18.706
Do not weaken now.

446
00:39:19.824 --> 00:39:22.888
Your weakness is your
blind hatred for your father

447
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:24.378
and your brother.

448
00:39:26.831 --> 00:39:28.919
You don't know when to stop fighting.

449
00:39:29.734 --> 00:39:31.257
You have already won.

450
00:39:31.598 --> 00:39:34.750
Kronos is draining Zeus' power.

451
00:40:21.619 --> 00:40:22.963
Hephaestus.

452
00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:43.133
Zeus?

453
00:40:43.941 --> 00:40:45.499
Ares.

454
00:40:45.709 --> 00:40:47.080
Hades.

455
00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:50.931
At last I knew you'd come.

456
00:40:51.173 --> 00:40:54.776
Poseidon,
I can see your trident glinting.

457
00:41:00.157 --> 00:41:02.042
It's not them.

458
00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:06.678
We're looking for Hephaestus,

459
00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:08.926
the maker of such mighty weapons.

460
00:41:09.154 --> 00:41:10.904
Well, should I let them in?

461
00:41:11.802 --> 00:41:13.440
He says no.

462
00:41:15.673 --> 00:41:18.078
But then he always says no.

463
00:41:21.345 --> 00:41:23.033
He always says...

464
00:41:24.348 --> 00:41:25.394
no.

465
00:41:27.184 --> 00:41:28.404
Yes.

466
00:41:36.527 --> 00:41:38.462
You are Perseus,

467
00:41:38.811 --> 00:41:40.587
son of Zeus.

468
00:41:42.466 --> 00:41:43.523
I am.

469
00:41:43.524 --> 00:41:45.736
Release the Kraken, all of that.

470
00:41:48.138 --> 00:41:50.072
Yeah.
Who are you?

471
00:41:51.275 --> 00:41:53.583
I am Agenor, son of Poseidon.

472
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:57.034
Agenor.

473
00:41:58.048 --> 00:41:59.655
Have you ever heard of Agenor?

474
00:41:59.982 --> 00:42:01.728
Never heard of you.

475
00:42:02.412 --> 00:42:03.144
Well your...

476
00:42:03.146 --> 00:42:05.212
friend may also know me
by the name...

477
00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:07.918
the Navigator.

478
00:42:09.426 --> 00:42:10.925
Navigator?

479
00:42:12.764 --> 00:42:14.629
Navigator.

480
00:42:16.184 --> 00:42:17.482
Still no.

481
00:42:17.891 --> 00:42:20.928
Don't worry, son, he says
there are many useless demiGods.

482
00:42:21.605 --> 00:42:22.856
Useless?

483
00:42:23.371 --> 00:42:25.324
About as useless as
your one-eyed friends.

484
00:42:25.439 --> 00:42:28.890
Those Cyclopes helped me
forge the God-weapons.

485
00:42:30.447 --> 00:42:32.248
Have respect.

486
00:42:37.021 --> 00:42:38.202
Navigator.

487
00:42:41.874 --> 00:42:42.898
Hold on, because...

488
00:42:43.894 --> 00:42:45.550
Poseidon dead,

489
00:42:45.851 --> 00:42:49.521
Zeus captured.
The words don't even sit together.

490
00:42:49.713 --> 00:42:52.849
We need your help to rescue Zeus
so he can stop Kronos.

491
00:42:55.439 --> 00:42:56.727
That's the plan, is it?

492
00:42:56.729 --> 00:42:57.531
Yeah.

493
00:42:57.532 --> 00:42:59.204
Right. Right.

494
00:42:59.206 --> 00:43:01.829
Well in that case, we'd best prepare.

495
00:43:01.831 --> 00:43:02.642
For what?

496
00:43:02.644 --> 00:43:04.304
The end of the bloody world.

497
00:43:04.503 --> 00:43:06.647
Kronos will dismantle the earth.

498
00:43:06.649 --> 00:43:09.776
You will be scattered
across the universe.

499
00:43:10.019 --> 00:43:11.628
Fantastic.

500
00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:16.074
You forged these weapons
right here for the Gods.

501
00:43:16.076 --> 00:43:17.690
You must be able to help us.

502
00:43:18.362 --> 00:43:19.499
Shut it.

503
00:43:19.975 --> 00:43:22.264
How could I when I have no
Godly power anymore?

504
00:43:22.265 --> 00:43:23.228
Who's he talking to?

505
00:43:23.229 --> 00:43:25.869
Don't you walk away from me.

506
00:43:26.231 --> 00:43:32.359
His all powerful father took it away from me when
I sided with Hades in their little family argument.

507
00:43:32.876 --> 00:43:36.402
Yes, I know now it was a mistake.

508
00:43:36.582 --> 00:43:38.471
People forget.

509
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:41.303
In the beginning,

510
00:43:41.742 --> 00:43:43.845
Hades was wise...

511
00:43:44.096 --> 00:43:45.288
and just,

512
00:43:45.635 --> 00:43:47.852
and strong.

513
00:43:48.258 --> 00:43:51.663
It were your daddy
became drunk on power.

514
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:55.903
We were even hoping
when Zeus came he might

515
00:43:55.937 --> 00:43:58.443
see his mistake and restore our...

516
00:43:59.303 --> 00:44:01.871
Why not?
He might have, had he come.

517
00:44:09.179 --> 00:44:12.010
I am sorry that you think
being human is not enough.

518
00:44:12.366 --> 00:44:15.561
But we humans hope
when there is no hope.

519
00:44:15.986 --> 00:44:19.649
And we believe when
to believe is idiotic.

520
00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:21.420
But sometimes,

521
00:44:21.901 --> 00:44:23.459
in spite of everything,

522
00:44:24.124 --> 00:44:25.660
we prevail.

523
00:44:27.564 --> 00:44:28.498
Now...

524
00:44:31.201 --> 00:44:33.835
which of you two is in charge?

525
00:44:34.668 --> 00:44:35.557
I am.

526
00:44:35.559 --> 00:44:36.560
Then...

527
00:44:38.475 --> 00:44:39.867
if we were Gods...

528
00:44:41.256 --> 00:44:43.376
how would you help us free Zeus?

529
00:44:45.283 --> 00:44:46.752
Oh, my dear.

530
00:44:49.386 --> 00:44:50.958
You remind me of someone.

531
00:44:53.824 --> 00:44:55.023
Aphrodite.

532
00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.055
She was my wife.

533
00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:02.601
Come with me.

534
00:45:03.567 --> 00:45:06.421
If Zeus is captive in the underworld,

535
00:45:06.423 --> 00:45:09.721
he's likely being held
in the heart of Tartarus.

536
00:45:10.874 --> 00:45:15.036
There can't be much time before
his life force is completely sapped.

537
00:45:15.037 --> 00:45:16.690
But how do we get to him?

538
00:45:17.281 --> 00:45:18.384
We can't.

539
00:45:18.532 --> 00:45:21.035
Normally you'd be right, young man.

540
00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:29.171
But when I designed this marvel,

541
00:45:29.211 --> 00:45:31.785
I included a secret passage,

542
00:45:31.787 --> 00:45:33.246
a shortcut if you will.

543
00:45:33.687 --> 00:45:35.293
You designed Tartarus?

544
00:45:35.295 --> 00:45:36.275
Oh, aye.

545
00:45:36.533 --> 00:45:38.057
And built it.

546
00:45:38.635 --> 00:45:39.983
Aphrodite,

547
00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:42.969
I could not only get you inside,

548
00:45:43.203 --> 00:45:46.490
I could give you a guided tour.

549
00:45:51.548 --> 00:45:55.920
In order for the prison of Tartarus
to be completely impregnable,

550
00:45:56.019 --> 00:45:58.919
I built it from the outside in.

551
00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:03.665
So I had to leave a passage for myself
to get out when the work was done.

552
00:46:04.366 --> 00:46:08.574
And this labyrinth is the only way a human
can travel through the underworld,

553
00:46:08.587 --> 00:46:12.353
and get to the heart of Tartarus.

554
00:46:42.499 --> 00:46:46.062
Where's my snarling bastard of a son Ares?

555
00:46:47.104 --> 00:46:50.155
Will Kronos really spare him?

556
00:46:51.511 --> 00:46:52.763
And you?

557
00:46:54.845 --> 00:46:57.075
Is there no end to this?

558
00:46:58.115 --> 00:46:59.617
I am afraid, brother.

559
00:46:59.796 --> 00:47:01.277
Is that what you want me to say?

560
00:47:01.279 --> 00:47:02.876
I am a God and I am afraid.

561
00:47:02.878 --> 00:47:04.019
Well, you should be.

562
00:47:04.021 --> 00:47:05.956
When your precious humans die,

563
00:47:05.958 --> 00:47:08.333
at least their souls go to another place.

564
00:47:09.226 --> 00:47:10.557
When a God dies,

565
00:47:10.559 --> 00:47:11.939
it isn't death.

566
00:47:12.596 --> 00:47:14.682
It's just absence.

567
00:47:15.966 --> 00:47:17.228
It's nothing.

568
00:47:19.703 --> 00:47:21.293
It's oblivion.

569
00:47:24.842 --> 00:47:26.013
It's oblivion.

570
00:47:29.313 --> 00:47:30.474
Perseus.

571
00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:35.664
Perseus.

572
00:47:37.221 --> 00:47:38.338
Father.

573
00:47:40.924 --> 00:47:42.196
I am close.

574
00:47:42.926 --> 00:47:44.518
Stay with me.

575
00:47:44.974 --> 00:47:47.535
You see, if you align
the edges correctly,

576
00:47:47.707 --> 00:47:50.260
it gives you a shifting depiction
of the interior.

577
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:52.489
Can I say, that is a masterpiece.

578
00:47:52.491 --> 00:47:54.233
Well, useful to a point.

579
00:47:54.438 --> 00:47:56.701
Would you let a lowly navigator hold it?
No.

580
00:47:57.153 --> 00:48:00.082
Well, you are the son of Poseidon.

581
00:48:00.744 --> 00:48:02.758
He's the one who taught me to navigate.

582
00:48:02.925 --> 00:48:05.112
That and how to seduce a mermaid,

583
00:48:05.113 --> 00:48:08.630
which seemed random, but came in
handy more often than you'd think.

584
00:48:08.911 --> 00:48:12.177
Thing to do is don't talk to her,
talk to her friend.

585
00:48:16.931 --> 00:48:19.920
Navigator, this is the entrance
to the labyrinth.

586
00:48:20.194 --> 00:48:22.068
There are hundreds of doors,

587
00:48:22.397 --> 00:48:24.214
all of which would kill you.

588
00:48:25.464 --> 00:48:26.357
Save one.

589
00:48:26.387 --> 00:48:30.566
You see, I designed it to play tricks
with the mind.

590
00:48:30.666 --> 00:48:32.819
After all, the mind is
the greatest trap of all.

591
00:48:32.931 --> 00:48:35.860
So you have got to control your fears,

592
00:48:36.246 --> 00:48:38.844
so you don't turn on
yourself or each other,

593
00:48:38.956 --> 00:48:41.056
if you want to make it to Tartarus.

594
00:48:49.059 --> 00:48:50.118
There it is.

595
00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:51.956
There's our door.

596
00:48:55.966 --> 00:48:57.158
Everybody back.

597
00:49:08.946 --> 00:49:10.635
Which one of you prayed to him?

598
00:49:43.185 --> 00:49:44.311
You betrayed our father.

599
00:49:45.115 --> 00:49:46.383
He betrayed me,

600
00:49:47.514 --> 00:49:48.582
by choosing you.

601
00:50:17.381 --> 00:50:19.247
You beauty.

602
00:50:21.418 --> 00:50:22.321
Come on.

603
00:50:22.653 --> 00:50:24.881
It won't stay open for long.

604
00:50:36.066 --> 00:50:38.227
No, not now.

605
00:50:49.846 --> 00:50:52.709
Great God Ares be merciful.
It was I who prayed to you.

606
00:50:52.711 --> 00:50:53.718
I was taught...

607
00:50:54.251 --> 00:50:55.498
to pray for my enemies.

608
00:50:55.545 --> 00:50:57.907
I prayed you would find peace
in your heart...

609
00:51:05.896 --> 00:51:08.854
We are brothers, but not equal.

610
00:51:13.336 --> 00:51:16.014
I have got to give them more time.

611
00:51:25.615 --> 00:51:28.188
One last Godly thing.

612
00:51:28.852 --> 00:51:30.062
Come on.

613
00:51:30.587 --> 00:51:32.885
Let's see what you blee...

614
00:51:34.091 --> 00:51:35.200
Perseus.

615
00:51:37.594 --> 00:51:38.583
Hephaestus.

616
00:51:42.866 --> 00:51:45.148
Perseus! The door's closing.
Come on.

617
00:51:45.299 --> 00:51:46.561
Ares.

618
00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.767
Is that all you got you sniveling...

619
00:51:51.472 --> 00:51:52.209
dog?

620
00:51:53.777 --> 00:51:54.940
Get to the door.

621
00:51:56.113 --> 00:51:57.220
Come on.
Come on.

622
00:52:21.547 --> 00:52:22.587
Korrina.

623
00:52:24.174 --> 00:52:26.060
She was a fool to pray to him...

624
00:52:27.844 --> 00:52:29.238
and he was a coward,

625
00:52:29.517 --> 00:52:30.718
to kill the weak.

626
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:33.382
He has fought in many wars.

627
00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:36.011
He's slaughtered
innocents for centuries.

628
00:52:37.226 --> 00:52:38.478
It's all he knows.

629
00:52:40.423 --> 00:52:41.549
I can't beat him.

630
00:52:42.325 --> 00:52:43.314
Mutton head.

631
00:52:43.527 --> 00:52:44.678
Two days ago,

632
00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.544
I was trapped in a cell in a dungeon,

633
00:52:46.725 --> 00:52:48.295
admittedly trying to escape,

634
00:52:48.827 --> 00:52:50.580
unbecoming of the son of Poseidon.

635
00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:52.548
But today I am here,

636
00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:54.543
and I am trying to save the universe.

637
00:52:55.472 --> 00:52:56.612
Jump in.

638
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:07.496
Your Majesty,

639
00:53:07.826 --> 00:53:08.788
I realize...

640
00:53:09.522 --> 00:53:11.466
in a labyrinth with
a million possibilities,

641
00:53:11.468 --> 00:53:13.511
this is the last thing
you want to hear but...

642
00:53:15.025 --> 00:53:16.277
follow me.

643
00:53:21.464 --> 00:53:22.550
That way.

644
00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:28.074
Or this way.

645
00:53:48.024 --> 00:53:50.883
I don't know how we will get
through this without Hephaestus.

646
00:53:57.367 --> 00:53:58.912
<i>Perseus.</i>

647
00:54:04.307 --> 00:54:06.241
<i>Where is your son?</i>

648
00:54:17.085 --> 00:54:18.882
This way.

649
00:54:25.027 --> 00:54:26.144
That way.

650
00:54:48.617 --> 00:54:49.687
This way.

651
00:55:00.095 --> 00:55:01.299
<i>Andromeda.</i>

652
00:55:03.298 --> 00:55:04.405
<i>Korrina.</i>

653
00:55:05.745 --> 00:55:07.508
<i>You must turn back.</i>

654
00:55:15.611 --> 00:55:17.206
This should be a corridor.

655
00:55:17.471 --> 00:55:18.861
This map makes no sense.

656
00:55:18.981 --> 00:55:19.988
<i>Andromeda.</i>

657
00:55:24.486 --> 00:55:25.969
There's something in here with us.

658
00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:30.349
Just give me the map.
No.

659
00:55:31.126 --> 00:55:32.731
The mighty Kraken slayer.

660
00:55:32.733 --> 00:55:34.795
Shouldn't he be somewhere
posing for a statue?

661
00:55:34.797 --> 00:55:36.353
Agenor just give me the map.

662
00:55:36.424 --> 00:55:38.943
The map is useless.

663
00:55:47.342 --> 00:55:48.331
This way.

664
00:55:54.201 --> 00:55:55.126
Agenor.

665
00:55:57.445 --> 00:55:59.094
I know where we're going.

666
00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:07.005
This way.

667
00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:19.700
Get back.

668
00:56:28.891 --> 00:56:29.550
Back.

669
00:56:36.525 --> 00:56:37.419
Get up.

670
00:56:50.238 --> 00:56:51.358
Andromeda.

671
00:56:57.372 --> 00:56:58.067
Yes.

672
00:57:09.391 --> 00:57:10.482
Take the weight.

673
00:57:16.432 --> 00:57:18.097
Come on, come on, come on.

674
00:57:22.004 --> 00:57:23.199
Go, go.

675
00:57:24.028 --> 00:57:24.622
Go.

676
00:58:11.153 --> 00:58:12.882
It's cold in here, isn't it?

677
00:58:29.504 --> 00:58:30.827
You're not real.

678
00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:33.092
Helius?

679
01:00:01.756 --> 01:00:03.252
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

680
01:00:03.402 --> 01:00:05.594
<i>Please, Dad, don't kill me.</i>

681
01:01:06.027 --> 01:01:07.740
Perseus.
Perseus.

682
01:01:08.797 --> 01:01:09.818
What happened?

683
01:01:16.638 --> 01:01:17.627
Tartarus.

684
01:01:20.508 --> 01:01:21.497
Come on, let's go.

685
01:01:22.811 --> 01:01:23.641
Come on.

686
01:01:33.388 --> 01:01:35.987
Kronos has his power now.

687
01:01:37.759 --> 01:01:38.874
Hades.

688
01:01:41.830 --> 01:01:43.263
I am so sorry.

689
01:01:44.199 --> 01:01:45.257
For what?

690
01:01:46.001 --> 01:01:47.491
For having banished you.

691
01:01:49.522 --> 01:01:51.251
Can you forgive me for that?

692
01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:54.030
Why do you ask?

693
01:01:55.777 --> 01:01:57.989
Because I forgive you for this.

694
01:02:00.415 --> 01:02:02.124
Release me, Hades.

695
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:04.834
I know there is still good in you.

696
01:02:13.595 --> 01:02:15.610
You have no pride, Hades.

697
01:02:17.032 --> 01:02:18.192
No.

698
01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.926
I won't let you kill him.

699
01:02:23.271 --> 01:02:24.499
Brother.

700
01:02:28.143 --> 01:02:29.506
You can't stop this.

701
01:02:46.656 --> 01:02:47.953
Ares.

702
01:03:19.794 --> 01:03:20.809
Come on.

703
01:03:28.303 --> 01:03:29.372
Go, go.

704
01:03:35.076 --> 01:03:36.941
Father. Father.

705
01:03:37.574 --> 01:03:38.403
Father.

706
01:03:38.498 --> 01:03:39.829
Open your eyes.

707
01:03:41.716 --> 01:03:42.973
Perseus.

708
01:03:44.486 --> 01:03:45.968
Perseus, my son.

709
01:04:04.806 --> 01:04:06.732
Use the power inside you.

710
01:04:33.068 --> 01:04:34.476
Perseus hurry.

711
01:04:59.427 --> 01:05:01.656
Ares. Andromeda.

712
01:05:18.713 --> 01:05:20.415
Hades come with us.

713
01:05:46.474 --> 01:05:47.502
No.

714
01:05:51.056 --> 01:05:51.962
Hades!

715
01:06:00.862 --> 01:06:02.786
Weapon. Give it to me.

716
01:06:04.325 --> 01:06:05.381
Hold them.

717
01:06:40.028 --> 01:06:41.353
Mantius, impressive.

718
01:06:41.362 --> 01:06:42.966
You gathered a fine army.

719
01:06:42.968 --> 01:06:44.797
I have prepared a royal tent.

720
01:06:44.798 --> 01:06:46.214
And is it fit for a God?

721
01:06:47.202 --> 01:06:48.793
Great Zeus. Great Zeus.

722
01:06:48.794 --> 01:06:50.460
Great Zeus.

723
01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:58.525
Kronos will come for me,

724
01:06:58.832 --> 01:06:59.826
Perseus.

725
01:07:00.582 --> 01:07:02.738
I don't have the power left to stop him.

726
01:07:06.054 --> 01:07:08.503
I wanted to leave
the world safe for you.

727
01:07:08.817 --> 01:07:09.854
I failed.

728
01:07:10.525 --> 01:07:12.087
I should have come with you.

729
01:07:12.755 --> 01:07:13.907
I was just...

730
01:07:13.909 --> 01:07:16.010
You pulled me out of Tartarus.

731
01:07:17.865 --> 01:07:19.162
You saved me.

732
01:07:20.335 --> 01:07:22.582
How do you suppose you did that?

733
01:07:23.805 --> 01:07:26.252
I never stopped thinking about
getting home to my son.

734
01:07:26.254 --> 01:07:27.893
Then you use that.

735
01:07:28.354 --> 01:07:29.715
Fight for your son.

736
01:07:30.845 --> 01:07:31.889
Remember,

737
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:35.498
only the Spear of
Trium can defeat Kronos.

738
01:07:35.949 --> 01:07:39.313
And the hand that holds that
spear will have to be yours.

739
01:07:46.188 --> 01:07:48.192
We have two pieces
of the Spear of Trium.

740
01:07:50.131 --> 01:07:51.485
Poseidon's trident...

741
01:07:53.534 --> 01:07:54.727
and Hades' pitchfork.

742
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:56.871
So, what we need is Zeus' thunderbolt.

743
01:07:56.921 --> 01:07:58.238
Which is on Ares' back.

744
01:08:01.976 --> 01:08:03.136
Yep.

745
01:08:05.146 --> 01:08:06.272
<i>Ares.</i>

746
01:08:07.482 --> 01:08:08.972
<i>Ares.</i>

747
01:08:09.751 --> 01:08:10.775
<i>Ares.</i>

748
01:08:11.853 --> 01:08:12.908
<i>Brother.</i>

749
01:08:15.089 --> 01:08:16.276
I pray to you.

750
01:08:18.226 --> 01:08:20.270
Meet me at the temple of the Gods.

751
01:08:23.164 --> 01:08:25.098
You say we're not equal.

752
01:08:27.602 --> 01:08:29.320
So come prove to me you're right.

753
01:08:33.641 --> 01:08:35.078
Prove to our father,

754
01:08:35.242 --> 01:08:36.665
that you're right.

755
01:08:38.746 --> 01:08:40.224
I hear you, brother.

756
01:08:47.822 --> 01:08:49.817
I will get the spear.
You hold him off.

757
01:08:56.485 --> 01:08:57.911
Don't give me the big speech.

758
01:08:58.533 --> 01:09:00.257
Yeah, I wasn't planning to.

759
01:09:24.223 --> 01:09:26.487
Our battle plan must be simple.

760
01:09:26.684 --> 01:09:28.048
Three lines of defense:

761
01:09:28.255 --> 01:09:31.206
Agenor's men will hold the front line
from the trenches.

762
01:09:31.947 --> 01:09:33.848
Cover every part of yourself,

763
01:09:34.174 --> 01:09:35.516
or you will be burned by the fire.

764
01:09:35.962 --> 01:09:37.461
Every piece of cloth,

765
01:09:38.087 --> 01:09:40.248
every piece of skin.
Help each other.

766
01:09:40.456 --> 01:09:41.831
Phalanxes behind that,

767
01:09:42.012 --> 01:09:44.189
and infantry as the last defense.

768
01:09:44.879 --> 01:09:46.789
I will lead the infantry myself.

769
01:09:47.248 --> 01:09:48.567
And our job,

770
01:09:48.569 --> 01:09:50.110
is to hold Kronos back,

771
01:09:50.498 --> 01:09:51.847
for as long as possible,

772
01:09:52.136 --> 01:09:53.851
if we're to stand a chance.

773
01:09:55.288 --> 01:09:56.332
Dig in!

774
01:09:57.263 --> 01:09:58.388
Position.

775
01:10:00.094 --> 01:10:01.584
Secure positions.

776
01:10:46.073 --> 01:10:47.543
Kronos is near.

777
01:11:01.756 --> 01:11:03.553
Makhai.

778
01:11:04.392 --> 01:11:06.019
Makhai.

779
01:11:17.939 --> 01:11:20.062
Light the fires.

780
01:11:20.107 --> 01:11:23.304
Light the fires.
Light the fires.

781
01:11:26.747 --> 01:11:27.771
Hold.

782
01:11:33.688 --> 01:11:35.178
Fire the artillery.

783
01:11:35.690 --> 01:11:36.679
Loose.

784
01:11:39.093 --> 01:11:40.424
Fire.

785
01:12:14.095 --> 01:12:15.125
Brother.

786
01:12:27.608 --> 01:12:28.613
Brother.

787
01:12:31.112 --> 01:12:32.557
Please don't hurt him.

788
01:12:32.628 --> 01:12:34.156
I am not going to hurt him.

789
01:12:34.262 --> 01:12:35.729
I am going to hurt you.

790
01:12:37.318 --> 01:12:38.727
And I want him to watch.

791
01:12:39.499 --> 01:12:40.892
I want you to know,

792
01:12:41.722 --> 01:12:43.028
what it feels like,

793
01:12:43.410 --> 01:12:45.374
when someone takes your father,

794
01:12:45.688 --> 01:12:46.918
away from you.

795
01:14:12.513 --> 01:14:14.122
Front line, attack.

796
01:14:14.348 --> 01:14:15.608
Stay with me.

797
01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:17.408
Stand firm.

798
01:15:12.707 --> 01:15:14.343
So this is what a father,

799
01:15:14.574 --> 01:15:16.078
would go through for his son?

800
01:15:43.803 --> 01:15:44.965
Brother.

801
01:15:47.708 --> 01:15:49.039
Brother.

802
01:15:50.578 --> 01:15:51.734
I do...

803
01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:54.425
forgive you.

804
01:16:18.405 --> 01:16:20.959
You look 10,000 years younger.

805
01:16:21.942 --> 01:16:23.102
And feel it.

806
01:16:28.482 --> 01:16:31.166
Death was circling you.

807
01:16:32.003 --> 01:16:35.285
That was the last time I will have
the strength to chase it away.

808
01:16:37.224 --> 01:16:39.361
We have the power between us,

809
01:16:40.079 --> 01:16:41.954
to put on a little display.

810
01:16:41.955 --> 01:16:43.618
Like in the old days.

811
01:16:44.098 --> 01:16:45.394
So shall we finish this?

812
01:16:45.395 --> 01:16:46.463
We have no weapons.

813
01:16:46.464 --> 01:16:48.464
We had power before we had weapons.

814
01:16:48.465 --> 01:16:50.433
When we were young Gods.
Yes.

815
01:16:51.495 --> 01:16:52.670
Let's have some fun.

816
01:19:15.783 --> 01:19:18.047
Helius. Weapons.

817
01:19:36.537 --> 01:19:38.835
Hold the line. Hold the line.

818
01:19:39.039 --> 01:19:40.267
Stand firm.

819
01:19:55.556 --> 01:19:56.784
The Spear of Trium.

820
01:20:10.704 --> 01:20:12.314
<i>Hades...</i>

821
01:20:20.114 --> 01:20:22.081
<i>Zeus...</i>

822
01:20:22.082 --> 01:20:24.107
The first strike's mine, brother.

823
01:21:02.156 --> 01:21:03.316
Perseus.

824
01:22:13.894 --> 01:22:15.327
Together now, brother.

825
01:22:33.714 --> 01:22:34.889
This is it, boy.

826
01:22:34.891 --> 01:22:36.492
They have given us a chance.

827
01:23:03.477 --> 01:23:04.548
Brother.

828
01:24:07.307 --> 01:24:08.899
Come on, stand up.

829
01:24:22.589 --> 01:24:26.047
Perseus. Perseus. Perseus.

830
01:25:00.927 --> 01:25:02.357
He's waiting for you...

831
01:25:04.164 --> 01:25:05.539
before he goes.

832
01:25:27.921 --> 01:25:29.802
Your boy gave you strength.

833
01:25:31.379 --> 01:25:32.363
Yes.

834
01:25:33.827 --> 01:25:35.191
As did mine.

835
01:25:40.434 --> 01:25:42.221
Perhaps Hades can heal you.

836
01:25:42.969 --> 01:25:45.164
He already gave me my last chance.

837
01:25:50.007 --> 01:25:52.221
And you sacrificed it for him.

838
01:25:54.348 --> 01:25:56.815
There will be no more sacrifices.

839
01:25:58.819 --> 01:26:00.345
No more Gods.

840
01:26:05.726 --> 01:26:08.440
Use your power wisely, Perseus.

841
01:26:27.013 --> 01:26:29.276
Thank you, my son.

842
01:26:59.212 --> 01:27:01.436
All my power is spent.

843
01:27:05.485 --> 01:27:06.738
Who knows?

844
01:27:08.555 --> 01:27:10.712
I might be stronger without it.

845
01:27:26.006 --> 01:27:28.163
I know it's broke.
No need to tell me.

846
01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:29.991
I could walk on it,

847
01:27:30.588 --> 01:27:31.736
my mum always said...

848
01:27:31.853 --> 01:27:33.916
you should let everyone
have their moment to shine.

849
01:27:33.918 --> 01:27:34.740
You know?

850
01:27:34.991 --> 01:27:36.631
So, you know, I am established.

851
01:27:36.684 --> 01:27:38.466
I have already got a name, you know.

852
01:27:38.851 --> 01:27:40.228
The Navigator.

853
01:27:43.135 --> 01:27:44.472
If I am not mistaken...

854
01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:47.221
you're the son of Perseus.

855
01:27:47.410 --> 01:27:48.513
I am Helius.

856
01:27:48.762 --> 01:27:50.600
Is that your boy, Helius?

857
01:28:00.273 --> 01:28:01.535
Go over there.

858
01:28:03.443 --> 01:28:04.432
Helius.

859
01:28:05.178 --> 01:28:06.970
Come here.
I have got a story to tell.

860
01:28:07.845 --> 01:28:09.529
Come and meet your Uncle Navigator.

861
01:28:20.126 --> 01:28:21.317
I am Agenor.

862
01:28:21.928 --> 01:28:23.026
Helius.

863
01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:26.306
I have read that you are
a great disappointment.

864
01:28:27.247 --> 01:28:28.739
That's right, I am great.

865
01:28:29.195 --> 01:28:30.430
This is my nurse,

866
01:28:30.697 --> 01:28:31.654
Tiger.

867
01:28:45.653 --> 01:28:47.648
We have to be prepared
if there is another attack.

868
01:28:47.649 --> 01:28:49.981
We're fortifying Argos
with the third regiment.

869
01:28:49.982 --> 01:28:52.862
Our engines will be ready in two days,
so in the west we can...

870
01:29:12.412 --> 01:29:13.260
Dad...

871
01:29:14.587 --> 01:29:16.595
I am actually looking forward
to going home.

872
01:29:18.018 --> 01:29:19.087
I have decided,

873
01:29:19.646 --> 01:29:21.868
being a boring
fisherman isn't that bad.

874
01:29:23.056 --> 01:29:24.801
You know we can't go back home.

875
01:29:42.016 --> 01:29:43.098
Take it.

876
01:29:48.348 --> 01:29:49.576
You're Helius.

877
01:29:52.052 --> 01:29:53.394
You're son of Perseus,

878
01:29:54.364 --> 01:29:56.016
the grandson of Zeus.

879
01:29:59.526 --> 01:30:00.379
Take it.

880
01:30:11.705 --> 01:30:12.844
It's heavy.

881
01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:15.455
Yeah, it is.

882
01:30:18.311 --> 01:30:19.729
Is it too much?

883
01:30:27.454 --> 01:30:28.484
No.

884
