Can I talk to you for a sec?

339

Remember? From middle school?

-How you doing?
-Wow.

341

Okay, Sandy Lyle,
last time I saw you...

342
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.198
you were playing bagpipes
in that movie.

343
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.151
Croco Tears. Yep, that's me.

344
00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.835
Polly! Can I have a word with you?

345
00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.831
-Sorry.
-Excuse us.

346
00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.508
What happened to you?

347
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.716
I'm in a situation here.
We must leave now.

348
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.313
Can we stay a couple more minutes?

349
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.834
Dude, no. This is serious.
I just sharted.

350
00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.748
I don't know what that means.

351
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.354
I tried to fart, and a little
shit came out. I sharted.

Now let's go.

353
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.512
You're the most disgusting person
I've ever met in my life.

354

and pour wine.

You're still acting?

I am.
Yeah, it's going incredibly well.

Polly's so wrong for me?

You don't even know this girl.

You haven't seen her
since seventh grade.

397
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.791

like that. Enough said. Ball in!

into Polly for a reason. Really.

You have no idea what I want.

1327
01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:20.433
You left Rodolfo behind.
Does that mean anything?

1328
01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:25.271
I made a mistake. I should've
never put you in the Riskmaster.

1329
01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.669
Truth is, no matter what happened
on our honeymoon...

1330
01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:30.194
-you're much riskier than Lisa.
-Yes! Right!

1331
01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:32.350
That's why it won't work out
between us.

1332
01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:35.398
Reuben, you're a nice,
safe, conventional guy.

1333
01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:37.550
It's not going to work out.

1334
01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:39.358
I don't think
that's who I really am.

1335
01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:41.874
It is. That's okay.

1336
01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:44.633
What do I have to do
to prove it to you?

1337
01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:45.709
Hey!

1338
01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:48.836
POLLY: What are you.... Oh, my God.

1339
01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:52.274
Hey, look! Look, I'm eating nuts.

1340
01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:56.192
-What are you doing?
-Those nuts aren't even dirty.

1341
01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:06.478
Since we've been together,
I've felt more uncomfortable...

1342
01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:09.950
out of place, embarrassed
and just physically sick...

1343
01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:11.473
than in my entire life.

1344
01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:13.437
But I couldn't have
gone through all that...

1345
01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:16.432
I couldn't have thrown up
19 times in 48 days...

1346
01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:19.995
if I wasn't in love with you.

1347
01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.668
Maybe you're right.
Maybe this is just a fling.

1348
01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:28.672
But if you get on that plane
and go to Cincinnati or Tanzania...

1349
01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:31.877
or wherever, we'll never know
if it could've been more.

1350
01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:35.674
POLLY: Oh, no.

1351
01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:38.752
[Polly continues protesting]

1352
01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:47.714
POLLY: Oh, Reuben.

1353
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.911
Please don't eat those.

1354
01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:52.793
POLLY: No, really.

1355
01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:03.075
I don't want you to go away.

1356
01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:07.795
-I'm not going to marry you.
-I don't want to get married.

1357
01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:10.914
I just want to take you to dinner.

1358
01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:12.912
Sometime this week.

1359
01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.997
Can I pick the place?

1362
01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:35.669
CLAUDE: Solid!

1363
01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.837
Excuse me. Hi. Hello.

1364
01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:43.675
I see you two are new to the island.
I want to come have a meet....

1365
01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:45.751
Oh, my stars and stripe, Reuben!

1366
01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:48.195
Oh, my God,
I cannot believe it is you.

1367
01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:50.510
-This is Polly.
-Hi, Polly. I am Claude.

1368
01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.158
Wow, hi.

1369
01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:53.759
So, how's it going?

1370
01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:57.629
In truth, it has been a little bit
tough noogies for me.

1371
01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.712
Lisa, she broke my heart.

1372
01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:03.793
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-That is life.

1373
01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.995
Well, you have to be like the hippo.

1374
01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:09.190
Exactly. Like the hippo.

1375
01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:13.072
So, let me guess.
You are here on honeymoon again?

1376
01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:16.709
CLAUDE: This is your beautiful bride?
REUBEN: No, we're just hanging out.

1377
01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:20.076
-It's more serious than that.
-I'm just saying we're not married.

1378
01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:22.390
Right. Definitely not married.
But it's possible.

1379
01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.515
It is possible.

1380
01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:26.831
We're taking things step by step,
seeing how they work out.

1381
01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:29.912
I don't really understand
what you're talking about...

1382
01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:32.156
but any chance
you're for scuba today?

1383
01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:34.231
You know what,
actually we are for scuba.

1384
01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.629
-No way, José!
-Yes way, José!

1385
01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:39.188
But, we're going out with that guy.

1386
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.911
We'll be out there in a minute!

1387
01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:46.877
You know what? As long as
you're for scuba, I am happy.

1388
01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:48.958
Oh, that's sweet.

1389
01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.917
So, au revoir, my good friend.

1390
01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:55.229
Thank you for everything, Claude.

1391
01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:58.240
It's good to see you again.
Good-bye, Polly.

1392
01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:01.069
POLLY: Nice to meet you, Claude.
CLAUDE: You, as well.

1393
01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:05.595
-So you're ready?
