1
00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:18.618
BILL: Do you find me sadistic?

2
00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.520
You know, Kiddo,

3
00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.690
I'd like to believe

4
00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:27.427
you're aware enough, even now,

5
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.097
to know that there's nothing sadistic

6
00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.633
in my actions.

7
00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.536
At this moment...

8
00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:41.107
this is me

9
00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:43.743
at my most masochistic.

10
00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:47.347
Bill... it's your ba--

11
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.215
(gunshot)

12
00:00:52.752 --> 00:00:54.654
THE BRIDE: Looked dead, didn't I?

13
00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:56.489
Well, I wasn't.

14
00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:59.392
But it wasn't from lack of trying, I can tell you that.

15
00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:03.463
Actually, Bill's last bullet put me in a coma,

16
00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:06.666
a coma I was to lie in for four years.

17
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.636
When I woke up, I went on

18
00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:11.604
what the movie advertisements refer to as,

19
00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:15.508
"A roaring rampage of revenge."

20
00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:18.711
I roared and I rampaged,

21
00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:22.348
and I got bloody satisfaction.

22
00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:26.252
I've killed a hell of a lot of people to get to this point,

23
00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:28.721
but I have only one more.

24
00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:31.724
The last one.

25
00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:35.361
The one I'm driving to right now.

26
00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:37.931
The only one left.

27
00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:41.468
And when I arrive at my destination,

28
00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:45.171
I am gonna kill Bill.

29
00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:12.298
THE BRIDE: Now, the incident that happened

30
00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:13.833
at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel

31
00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:17.203
that put this whole gory story into motion

32
00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:19.806
has since become legend.

33
00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.408
"Massacre at Two Pines."

34
00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:24.477
That's what the newspapers called it.

35
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:26.446
The local TV news called it

36
00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:30.650
"The El Paso, Texas, Wedding Chapel Massacre."

37
00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:33.453
How it happened, who was there,

38
00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:36.456
how many got killed and who killed them

39
00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.959
changes depending on who's telling the story.

40
00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.194
In actual fact,

41
00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:45.465
the massacre didn't happen during a wedding at all.

42
00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:48.334
It was a wedding rehearsal.

43
00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:50.370
REVEREND: Now, when we come to the part where I say,

44
00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:54.807
"You may kiss the bride," you may kiss the bride,

45
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.709
but don't stick your tongue in her mouth.

46
00:02:56.743 --> 00:02:58.545
(laughter)

47
00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.648
This might be funny to your friends,

48
00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:05.251
but it would be embarrassing to your parents.

49
00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:09.656
We'll try to restrain ourselves, reverend.

50
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.425
RUFUS: Y'all got a song?

51
00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:19.666
How 'bout Love Me Tender? I can play that.

52
00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.668
-THE BRIDE: Sure. -Yeah.

53
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:24.270
GROOM: Love Me Tender would be great.

54
00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:27.373
Rufus, he's the man.

55
00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:30.476
Rufus, who was that that you used to play for?

56
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.445
Rufus Thomas.

57
00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:35.481
Rufus Thomas. Rufus Thomas.

58
00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:38.451
RUFUS: I was a Drell. I was a Drifter.

59
00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:39.852
I was a Coaster.

60
00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:43.590
I was part of the Gang. I was a Bar-kay.

61
00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:47.927
If they come through Texas, I played with 'em.

62
00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:50.997
Rufus, he's the man.

63
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.803
-Have I forgotten anything? -Um...

64
00:03:56.836 --> 00:04:00.306
Oh, yes. You forgot, uh, the seating arrangements.

65
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.942
-Thank you, mother. -Yes.

66
00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:05.345
Now, the way we normally do this,

67
00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:07.647
we have the bride's side,

68
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.482
and then we have the groom's side.

69
00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:12.685
But since the bride ain't got nobody comin',

70
00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:16.756
and the groom's got far too many people comin'...

71
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.292
Well, yeah, they're comin' all the way from Oklahoma.

72
00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:25.365
REVEREND: Right. Well, I don't see no problem with...

73
00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:29.669
the groom's side sharing the bride's side.

74
00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:30.670
Do you, mother?

75
00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:33.706
I don't have a problem with that. But, uh...

76
00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:35.775
REVEREND'S WIFE: Honey, you know, it would be

77
00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:38.678
good if you had somebody come.

78
00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:40.580
You know, as a sign of good faith?

79
00:04:42.682 --> 00:04:44.851
Well, I don't have anybody,

80
00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:47.754
except for Tommy and my friends.

81
00:04:49.155 --> 00:04:51.424
You have no family?

82
00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:53.459
Well, I'm workin' on changing that.

83
00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:55.028
Mrs. Harmony, we're all the family

84
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:57.697
this little angel's ever gonna need.

85
00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:00.600
I'm not feeling very well,

86
00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:03.069
and this bitch is starting to piss me off.

87
00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:05.104
So while y'all blather on,

88
00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:06.706
I'm gonna go outside and get some air.

89
00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:07.974
Okay.

90
00:05:08.007 --> 00:05:09.809
THE BRIDE: Um, uh, reverend, sorry, uh...

91
00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:11.511
She's gonna go out and get some air.

92
00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:13.813
Yeah. Given her delicate condition.

93
00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:15.782
She just needs a few minutes to get it together.

94
00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:18.685
-She'll be okay. -REVEREND: Right.

95
00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:25.591
(flute plays)

96
00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.797
Hello, Kiddo.

97
00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.871
How did you find me?

98
00:06:45.705 --> 00:06:47.106
I'm the man.

99
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.912
What are you doin' here?

100
00:06:54.847 --> 00:06:56.816
What am I doin'?

101
00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:00.186
Well,

102
00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:03.923
a moment ago I was playing my flute.

103
00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:12.765
At this moment...

104
00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:14.934
I'm lookin' at the most beautiful bride

105
00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:17.236
these old eyes have ever seen.

106
00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:20.807
Why are you here?

107
00:07:21.574 --> 00:07:23.242
Last look.

108
00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:26.879
Are you gonna be nice?

109
00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:31.017
I've never been nice my whole life.

110
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.487
But I'll do my best to be sweet.

111
00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:36.722
Hmm.

112
00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:39.158
I always told you,

113
00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:42.762
your sweet side is your best side.

114
00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:46.999
I guess that's why you're the only one who's ever seen it.

115
00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:51.571
See you got a bun in the oven.

116
00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:53.573
Hmm.

117
00:07:55.107 --> 00:07:56.242
I'm knocked up.

118
00:07:57.643 --> 00:08:00.680
Jeez, Louise. That young man of yours

119
00:08:00.713 --> 00:08:04.984
sure doesn't believe in wasting time, does he?

120
00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:07.186
Have you seen Tommy?

121
00:08:09.956 --> 00:08:13.192
-Big guy in the tux? -Yes.

122
00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:14.894
Then I saw him.

123
00:08:16.362 --> 00:08:18.531
I like his hair.

124
00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:23.836
You promised you'd be nice.

125
00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:27.874
No, I said I'd do my best. That's hardly a promise.

126
00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:31.210
But you're right.

127
00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:34.914
What does your young man do for a living?

128
00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:39.151
He owns a used record store here in El Paso.

129
00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:41.821
Ah. Music lover, eh?

130
00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:43.756
He's fond of music.

131
00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:46.592
Aren't we all?

132
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:55.167
And what are you doing for a j-o-b these days?

133
00:08:56.335 --> 00:08:59.105
I work in the record store.

134
00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:01.707
Ah, so...

135
00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:06.312
It all suddenly seems so clear.

136
00:09:08.414 --> 00:09:10.716
Do you like it?

137
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.153
Yeah. I like it a lot, smartass.

138
00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:16.822
I get to listen to music all day,

139
00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:20.259
talk about music all day. It's really cool.

140
00:09:21.794 --> 00:09:23.029
It's gonna be a great environment

141
00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:25.298
for my little girl to grow up in.

142
00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:32.772
As opposed to jetting around the world, killing human beings

143
00:09:32.805 --> 00:09:35.675
and being paid vast sums of money?

144
00:09:37.743 --> 00:09:39.345
Precisely.

145
00:09:39.378 --> 00:09:42.081
Well, my old friend,

146
00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:44.216
to each his own.

147
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:48.821
However, all cock blockery aside,

148
00:09:49.221 --> 00:09:52.124
I am looking forward to meeting your young man.

149
00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:57.930
I happen to be, more or less, particular whom my gal marries.

150
00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:02.335
You want to come to the wedding?

151
00:10:02.368 --> 00:10:04.136
Only if I can sit on the bride's side.

152
00:10:06.038 --> 00:10:08.975
You'll find it a bit lonely on my side.

153
00:10:09.008 --> 00:10:12.178
Your side always was a bit lonely.

154
00:10:12.845 --> 00:10:15.881
But I wouldn't sit anywhere else.

155
00:10:17.483 --> 00:10:19.852
You know,

156
00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:22.188
I had the loveliest dream about you--

157
00:10:22.221 --> 00:10:24.657
Oh, here's Tommy! Call me Arlene.

158
00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:26.926
-BILL: You must be Tommy! -Uh-huh.

159
00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:29.328
Arlene's told me so much about you.

160
00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:32.365
-Honey, you okay? -Oh, I'm fine.

161
00:10:32.398 --> 00:10:34.767
Tommy, I'd like you to meet my father.

162
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.204
-Ha, ha. Hi. -Oh, my God!

163
00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:40.106
Oh, my God, this is great!

164
00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:43.042
I'm so glad to meet you, sir... uh, dad.

165
00:10:43.442 --> 00:10:45.177
The name's Bill.

166
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:47.813
Well, it's great to meet you... Bill.

167
00:10:47.847 --> 00:10:49.415
Arlene told me you couldn't make it.

168
00:10:50.216 --> 00:10:52.718
-Surprise. -That's my pop for ya.

169
00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:54.387
Always full of surprises.

170
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.957
Well, in the surprise department,

171
00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.826
the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

172
00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:03.863
-When did you get in? -Just now.

173
00:11:03.896 --> 00:11:05.898
Did you come straight from Australia?

174
00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:07.900
-Of course. -Daddy, I told Tommy

175
00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:09.468
that you were in Perth mining for silver,

176
00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:12.371
and no one could reach you.

177
00:11:12.938 --> 00:11:16.008
Lucky for us all, that's not the case.

178
00:11:16.475 --> 00:11:19.311
So... what's this all about?

179
00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:22.248
I've heard of wedding rehearsals,

180
00:11:22.281 --> 00:11:24.350
but I don't believe I've ever heard of

181
00:11:24.383 --> 00:11:27.053
a wedding dress rehearsal before.

182
00:11:27.086 --> 00:11:29.388
We thought, "Why pay so much money for a dress

183
00:11:29.422 --> 00:11:31.290
you're only gonna wear once?"

184
00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:34.126
Especially when Arlene looks so goddamn beautiful in it.

185
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.494
So I think we're gonna try

186
00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.963
to get all the mileage we can out of it.

187
00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:41.400
Isn't it supposed to be bad luck for the groom

188
00:11:41.434 --> 00:11:44.336
to see the bride in her wedding dress

189
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.938
before the ceremony?

190
00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:49.775
Well, I guess I just believe in living dangerously.

191
00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:54.146
I know just what you mean.

192
00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:57.283
REVEREND: Son, some of us have places to be.

193
00:11:57.583 --> 00:11:59.218
RUFUS: Sure do.

194
00:11:59.251 --> 00:12:01.787
Look, we gotta go through this one more time,

195
00:12:01.821 --> 00:12:03.556
so why don't you have a s...

196
00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:05.124
Oh, my God.

197
00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:07.827
What am I thinking? You should give her away!

198
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.996
Tommy, that's not exactly daddy's cup of tea.

199
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:14.233
I think father would be much more comfortable

200
00:12:14.266 --> 00:12:15.501
sitting with the rest of the guests.

201
00:12:15.534 --> 00:12:17.269
Hmm. Really?

202
00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:19.939
That's asking a lot.

203
00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.509
Oh. Okay. Well, forget it.

204
00:12:24.176 --> 00:12:26.312
But how about we go out to dinner tonight to celebrate?

205
00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:29.148
Only on the condition that I pay for everything.

206
00:12:29.181 --> 00:12:31.317
Deal. We got to do this now.

207
00:12:31.951 --> 00:12:33.352
Can I watch?

208
00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:35.421
Absolutely. Have a seat.

209
00:12:36.021 --> 00:12:37.823
Which is the bride's side?

210
00:12:37.857 --> 00:12:39.825
Right over here.

211
00:12:42.528 --> 00:12:46.198
REVEREND: Mother, here we go!

212
00:12:46.232 --> 00:12:49.902
Now, son, about them vows...

213
00:12:55.941 --> 00:12:59.044
Bill... I just want--

214
00:12:59.078 --> 00:13:01.847
You don't owe me a damn thing.

215
00:13:02.982 --> 00:13:05.184
If he's the man you want,

216
00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:09.221
then go stand by him.

217
00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:34.213
Do I look pretty?

218
00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:36.415
Oh, yes.

219
00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:48.861
Thank you.

220
00:13:53.966 --> 00:13:55.467
REVEREND: Oh, good.

221
00:14:21.227 --> 00:14:23.429
(reverend speaking indistinctly)

222
00:14:23.462 --> 00:14:25.331
REVEREND: What the hell?

223
00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:26.532
(screaming)

224
00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:28.500
THE BRIDE: No! Bill!

225
00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:30.669
(machine-gun fire)

226
00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:36.942
(dog barking)

227
00:14:36.976 --> 00:14:39.111
(bell tolling)

228
00:15:07.673 --> 00:15:12.177
You tellin' me she cut her way through 88 bodyguards

229
00:15:12.211 --> 00:15:13.712
'fore she got to O-Ren?

230
00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:16.115
Nah, there wasn't really 88 of 'em.

231
00:15:16.148 --> 00:15:19.151
They just call themselves "The Crazy 88."

232
00:15:19.184 --> 00:15:21.120
-How come? -I don't know.

233
00:15:21.153 --> 00:15:23.122
I guess they thought it sounded cool.

234
00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:28.427
Anyhow, they all fell under her Hanzo sword.

235
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.462
She got a Hanzo sword?

236
00:15:30.496 --> 00:15:32.097
He made one for her.

237
00:15:32.131 --> 00:15:35.534
Didn't he swear a blood oath to never make another sword?

238
00:15:36.135 --> 00:15:39.505
It would appear he has broken it.

239
00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:45.311
Them Japs sure know how to hold a grudge, don't they?

240
00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:46.979
(laughing)

241
00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:51.684
Or maybe you just tend to bring that out in people.

242
00:15:53.052 --> 00:15:56.722
I know this is a ridiculous question before I ask it,

243
00:15:57.523 --> 00:16:02.027
but you haven't, by any chance, kept up with your... swordplay?

244
00:16:04.263 --> 00:16:05.597
I, um...

245
00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:10.169
(belches) I pawned that years ago.

246
00:16:10.669 --> 00:16:13.672
You hocked a Hattori Hanzo sword?

247
00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.041
Yep.

248
00:16:16.408 --> 00:16:18.110
It was priceless.

249
00:16:20.846 --> 00:16:22.514
(laughing)

250
00:16:22.548 --> 00:16:26.518
Well, not in El Paso, it ain't. (laughing)

251
00:16:27.086 --> 00:16:30.122
In El Paso, I got me $250 for it.

252
00:16:31.724 --> 00:16:36.095
I'm a bouncer in a titty bar, Bill. (sniffs)

253
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.698
If she wants to fight with me, all she's gotta do

254
00:16:39.732 --> 00:16:41.834
is come down to the club and start some shit

255
00:16:41.867 --> 00:16:43.569
and we'll be in a fight.

256
00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:50.075
I know we haven't spoken in some time,

257
00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:53.846
and the last time we spoke wasn't the most pleasant,

258
00:16:53.879 --> 00:16:57.683
but you've got to get over being mad at me

259
00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.652
and start becoming afraid of (bleep)

260
00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:04.456
Because she is coming, and she's coming to kill you.

261
00:17:05.758 --> 00:17:07.426
And, unless you accept my assistance,

262
00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:10.162
I have no doubt she will succeed.

263
00:17:19.238 --> 00:17:20.606
I don't dodge guilt,

264
00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:23.475
and I don't Jew out of paying my comeuppance.

265
00:17:26.145 --> 00:17:29.548
Can't we just... forget the past?

266
00:17:32.251 --> 00:17:35.721
That woman deserves her revenge.

267
00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:45.631
And we deserve to die.

268
00:17:50.636 --> 00:17:53.105
(laughing) But, then again,

269
00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:55.207
so does she.

270
00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:01.480
So I guess

271
00:18:01.513 --> 00:18:03.782
we'll just see.

272
00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:06.452
Won't we?

273
00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:39.218
(woman singing in Spanish)

274
00:18:43.522 --> 00:18:45.424
Late again.

275
00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:48.460
Budd, can't you tell time?

276
00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:50.496
There ain't nobody in here, man.

277
00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:52.965
-LARRY: Is that Budd? -Yeah.

278
00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:55.801
Tell him to get his fucking ass back here!

279
00:18:56.335 --> 00:18:57.903
Okay.

280
00:18:57.936 --> 00:19:01.240
Budd, Larry'd like a word with ya.

281
00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:09.381
Take a hit. Be somebody, baby.

282
00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:20.893
BUDD: You looking for me?

283
00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:29.902
I don't know what car wash you worked before you came here

284
00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:32.237
that let you stroll in 20 minutes late,

285
00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:35.274
but it wasn't owned by me and I own a fucking car wash.

286
00:19:35.307 --> 00:19:37.309
-Do you want me to leave? -No, I don't want you to leave.

287
00:19:37.342 --> 00:19:39.411
I want you to sit and wait.

288
00:19:39.444 --> 00:19:41.246
Larry,

289
00:19:41.647 --> 00:19:44.483
there ain't nobody out there, so...

290
00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:48.420
"There's nobody out there, Larry."

291
00:19:50.389 --> 00:19:54.426
What's your point? That you're not needed here?

292
00:19:54.826 --> 00:19:58.430
My point is I'm a bouncer,

293
00:19:58.964 --> 00:20:02.034
and there ain't nobody out there to bounce.

294
00:20:02.067 --> 00:20:03.902
You saying that the reason

295
00:20:05.437 --> 00:20:07.839
that you're not doing the job

296
00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:10.609
that I'm paying you to do

297
00:20:10.642 --> 00:20:13.879
is that you don't have a job to do?

298
00:20:15.981 --> 00:20:18.383
-No... -Is that what you're saying?

299
00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:20.285
What are you trying to convince me of, exactly?

300
00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:24.389
That you're as useless as an asshole right here?

301
00:20:24.423 --> 00:20:26.792
Well, guess what, Buddy?

302
00:20:26.825 --> 00:20:31.296
I think you just fucking convinced me.

303
00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:35.901
Let's go to the calendar. It's calendar time.

304
00:20:36.702 --> 00:20:38.770
Calendar time for Buddy.

305
00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:42.307
-Okay. You working tomorrow? -Yeah.

306
00:20:42.507 --> 00:20:44.576
Mm. No, you're not.

307
00:20:44.943 --> 00:20:47.346
You don't know what fucking day you work.

308
00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:48.847
Here. You're not working tomorrow.

309
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.516
You're working Wednesday. Here you are. There you go.

310
00:20:52.351 --> 00:20:54.353
-Workin' Thursday? -Yeah.

311
00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:56.989
I don't think so. Friday?

312
00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.360
-I don't-- There's your name. -BUDDY: If you say so.

313
00:21:01.393 --> 00:21:03.962
There used to be your name. Okay?

314
00:21:03.996 --> 00:21:05.964
Saturday. There used to be your name.

315
00:21:05.998 --> 00:21:07.466
Oh.

316
00:21:07.499 --> 00:21:10.569
Uh, Monday... Here, how about that?

317
00:21:10.602 --> 00:21:12.004
Fucking with your cash is the only thing

318
00:21:12.037 --> 00:21:15.073
you kids seem to understand. Okay?

319
00:21:16.742 --> 00:21:18.944
Now, I want you to go home till I call you.

320
00:21:18.977 --> 00:21:20.946
Till I call you.

321
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.048
Before you leave, talk to Rocket.

322
00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:25.484
She's got a job for you to do.

323
00:21:27.019 --> 00:21:29.321
And...

324
00:21:29.988 --> 00:21:32.457
for the hat,

325
00:21:32.724 --> 00:21:34.893
that fucking hat.

326
00:21:35.927 --> 00:21:38.697
LARRY: That fucking hat.

327
00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:40.766
How many times have I told you,

328
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.870
don't wear that fucking hat here? How many?

329
00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:51.610
Customers wear hats.

330
00:21:51.643 --> 00:21:54.479
Well, I'm not the boss of the customers.

331
00:21:54.513 --> 00:21:55.981
I'm the boss of you.

332
00:21:56.782 --> 00:21:58.884
And I'm telling you that I want you

333
00:21:58.917 --> 00:22:02.421
to keep that shit-kicker hat at home.

334
00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:40.992
Yeah, Budd, honey, uh, the toilet is at it again.

335
00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:43.962
There's shitty water all over the floor.

336
00:22:44.496 --> 00:22:47.566
Okay, Rocket.

337
00:22:49.768 --> 00:22:52.771
-I'll clean it up. -Mm-hmm.

BUDD: I just caught me the cowgirl ain't never been caught.

00:29:21.926 --> 00:29:23.561
ELLE: Did you kill her?

390

Well, not yet, I ain't.

391
00:29:26.264 --> 00:29:28.867

00:29:30.635 --> 00:29:33.805

00:29:50.155 --> 00:29:53.224
And I'm here to tell ya, Elle,

399
00:29:53.258 --> 00:29:55.193
that's what I call sharp.

400
00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.061
How much?

401
00:29:57.095 --> 00:30:00.131
Oh, that's hard to say, bein' that it's...

402
00:30:00.165 --> 00:30:01.933

You get your bony ass down here first thing in the morning

406
00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:18.049
and I'll give you the greatest sword ever made by a man.

407
00:30:22.353 --> 00:30:24.155
Now, how do you like the sound of that?

408
00:30:24.189 --> 00:30:27.025
Sounds like we got a deal. One condition.

409
00:30:27.959 --> 00:30:29.093
What?

410
00:30:29.127 --> 00:30:32.597
She must suffer to her last breath.

411
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:35.200

00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:41.306
I can pretty much damn well guarantee.

414
00:30:42.207 --> 00:30:45.176
Then I'll see you in the mornin', millionaire.

00:30:46.244 --> 00:30:47.645

MAN: I'm done!

422
00:32:30.481 --> 00:32:33.284
Get me outta this hole!

00:32:36.087 --> 00:32:37.588
BUDD: Good.

00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:48.299
MAN: Whew.

425
00:33:10.455 --> 00:33:12.523
Whoa, look at those eyes.

426
00:33:12.557 --> 00:33:16.160
MAN: This bitch is furious. (chuckles)

427
00:33:16.728 --> 00:33:19.430
What did I tell ya?

428
00:33:19.664 --> 00:33:23.234
Is she the cutest little blond pussy you ever saw?

429
00:33:23.267 --> 00:33:27.171
Or, is she the cutest little blond pussy you ever saw?

430
00:33:27.372 --> 00:33:29.040
I seen better.

431
00:33:34.479 --> 00:33:36.214
You got anything to say?

432
00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:42.253
White women call this "The silent treatment."

433
00:33:42.286 --> 00:33:44.722
And we let 'em think we don't like it.

434
00:33:49.794 --> 00:33:51.662
You grab the feet, I get the head.

435
00:33:59.804 --> 00:34:02.573
Hey. Hey. Hey!

436
00:34:03.541 --> 00:34:06.177
Wiggle worm, you see this?

437
00:34:07.645 --> 00:34:09.680
You see it, don't ya?

438
00:34:11.849 --> 00:34:14.152
That's a can of mace.

439
00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:16.721
Mm-hmm. No.

440
00:34:16.754 --> 00:34:19.424
You're goin' underneath the ground tonight.

441
00:34:19.757 --> 00:34:23.461
And that's all there is to it.

442
00:34:26.831 --> 00:34:29.434
I wanna bury ya.

443
00:34:31.769 --> 00:34:33.838
I was gonna bury ya...

444
00:34:38.543 --> 00:34:41.312
(chuckles) ...with this.

445
00:34:45.383 --> 00:34:48.152
But if you're gonna act like a horse's ass...

446
00:34:50.888 --> 00:34:54.859
I'm gonna spray this whole goddamn can

447
00:34:54.892 --> 00:34:56.594
right in your eyeballs!

448
00:34:56.627 --> 00:35:00.131
I'll burn 'em right outta your fucking head.

449
00:35:00.832 --> 00:35:03.668
Then you're gonna be blind

450
00:35:03.701 --> 00:35:05.236
and burnin'...

451
00:35:08.372 --> 00:35:09.907
and buried alive.

452
00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.282
Now, what's it gonna be, sister?

453
00:35:28.659 --> 00:35:30.828
That's a wise decision.

454
00:35:34.899 --> 00:35:37.535
(breathing heavily)

455
00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:46.911
This is for breakin' my brother's heart.

456
00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:59.190

457
00:36:22.713 --> 00:36:24.448

472
00:37:29.013 --> 00:37:31.782
(loud thud )

473
00:37:31.983 --> 00:37:33.918

477
00:37:52.903 --> 00:37:55.072

478
00:37:58.843 --> 00:38:01.078

(enraged grunting)

485

(engine starts up)

486
00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:49.460
(vehicle leaves)

487
00:38:49.493 --> 00:38:51.662
(sobs)

488
00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:38.909
Once upon a time,

489
00:39:38.943 --> 00:39:41.779
in China,

490
00:39:41.812 --> 00:39:45.683
some believe around the year

491
00:39:45.716 --> 00:39:49.086
one, double aught, three,

492
00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:52.490
head priest of the White Lotus Clan, Pai Mei,

493
00:39:52.523 --> 00:39:56.093
was walking down a road

494
00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.629
contemplating whatever it is

495
00:39:58.662 --> 00:40:02.066
that a man of Pai Mei's infinite powers

496
00:40:02.867 --> 00:40:04.969
would contemplate.

497
00:40:05.002 --> 00:40:07.705
Which is another way of saying, "Who knows?"

498
00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:12.743
When a Shaolin monk appeared on the road,

499
00:40:12.777 --> 00:40:15.813
traveling in the opposite direction.

500
00:40:15.846 --> 00:40:19.049
As the monk and the priest crossed paths,

501
00:40:19.917 --> 00:40:21.986
Pai Mei,

502
00:40:22.019 --> 00:40:26.824
in a practically unfathomable display of generosity,

503
00:40:27.658 --> 00:40:30.961
gave the monk the slightest of nods.

504
00:40:32.797 --> 00:40:34.732
The nod

505
00:40:34.765 --> 00:40:37.101
was not returned.

506
00:40:40.204 --> 00:40:43.774
Now, was it the intention of the Shaolin monk

507
00:40:43.808 --> 00:40:46.744
to insult Pai Mei?

508
00:40:46.777 --> 00:40:52.049
Or did he just fail to see the generous social gesture?

509
00:40:52.082 --> 00:40:56.487
The motives of the monk remain unknown.

510
00:40:56.954 --> 00:40:58.756
What is known

511
00:40:58.789 --> 00:41:01.759
were the consequences.

512
00:41:02.693 --> 00:41:04.862
(flute playing)

513
00:41:13.771 --> 00:41:15.673
The next morning,

514
00:41:15.706 --> 00:41:19.944
Pai Mei appeared at the Shaolin temple

515
00:41:19.977 --> 00:41:23.280
and demanded of the temple's head abbot

516
00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:29.920
that he offer Pai Mei his neck to repay the insult.

517
00:41:29.954 --> 00:41:34.325
The abbot, at first, tried to console Pai Mei,

518
00:41:34.358 --> 00:41:38.295
only to find Pai Mei was...

519
00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:40.231
inconsolable.

520
00:41:40.264 --> 00:41:42.833
(flute playing)

521
00:41:51.709 --> 00:41:53.911
So began...

522
00:41:53.944 --> 00:41:56.580
the massacre of the Shaolin temple

523
00:41:56.614 --> 00:41:59.783
and all sixty of the monks inside,

524
00:41:59.817 --> 00:42:03.287
at the fists of the White Lotus.

525
00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:07.258
And so began the legend

526
00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:11.695
of Pai Mei's five-point-palm exploding-heart technique.

527
00:42:11.729 --> 00:42:12.997
And what, pray tell,

528
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:15.799
is the five-point-palm exploding-heart technique?

529
00:42:15.833 --> 00:42:21.038
Quite simply, the deadliest blow in all of martial arts.

530
00:42:23.274 --> 00:42:27.044
He hits you with his fingertips

531
00:42:27.077 --> 00:42:31.081
at five different pressure points on your body,

532
00:42:31.115 --> 00:42:34.018
and then lets you walk away.

533
00:42:35.052 --> 00:42:38.155
But once you've taken five steps,

534
00:42:38.188 --> 00:42:41.325
your heart explodes inside your body

535
00:42:42.293 --> 00:42:45.729
and you fall to the floor, dead.

536
00:42:46.397 --> 00:42:48.766
-Did he teach you that? -No.

537
00:42:50.234 --> 00:42:51.869
He teaches no one

538
00:42:51.902 --> 00:42:54.939
the five-point-palm exploding-heart technique.

539
00:42:55.372 --> 00:42:57.041
Now...

540
00:42:57.708 --> 00:43:02.646
one of the things I've always liked about you, Kiddo...

541
00:43:04.815 --> 00:43:08.319
is you appear wise beyond your years.

542
00:43:11.388 --> 00:43:15.726
So, allow me to impart a word to the wise.

543
00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:21.799
Whatever... whatever Pai Mei says, obey.

544
00:43:23.267 --> 00:43:26.904
If you flash him, even for an instant, a defiant eye,

545
00:43:26.937 --> 00:43:29.106
he'll pluck it out.

546
00:43:29.139 --> 00:43:33.043
And if you throw any American sass his way,

547
00:43:33.811 --> 00:43:37.281
he'll snap your back and your neck like they were twigs.

548
00:43:40.317 --> 00:43:43.287
And that will be the story of you.

549
00:43:46.023 --> 00:43:48.892
(flute playing)

550
00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:06.076
He'll accept you as his student.

551
00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:08.178
-What happened to you? -Nothin'.

552
00:44:08.212 --> 00:44:09.847
Get in a fight?

553
00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.382
Friendly contest.

554
00:44:11.415 --> 00:44:12.983
Why did he accept me?

555
00:44:13.017 --> 00:44:17.287
Because he's a very, very, very old man.

556
00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:20.457
And, like all rotten bastards,

557
00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:24.161
when they become old, they get lonely.

558
00:44:25.896 --> 00:44:28.966
Which has no effect on their dispositions,

559
00:44:28.999 --> 00:44:33.037
but it does teach them the value of company.

560
00:44:33.971 --> 00:44:36.240
BILL: Whew. Oh.

561
00:44:36.874 --> 00:44:41.045
Just seein' those steps again makes me ache.

562
00:44:42.046 --> 00:44:44.982
You're gonna have a lot of fun carrying buckets of water

563
00:44:45.015 --> 00:44:47.451
up and down that fucker.

564
00:44:51.555 --> 00:44:53.791
When will I see you again?

565
00:44:53.824 --> 00:44:57.227
That's the title of my favorite soul song of the 70s.

566
00:44:57.261 --> 00:44:59.296
-What? -Nothin'.

567
00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:02.499
When he tells me you're done.

568
00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:04.468
When do you think that might be?

569
00:45:04.501 --> 00:45:07.471
That, my dearest, depends entirely on you.

570
00:45:07.504 --> 00:45:11.208
Now remember, no sarcasm, no back talk.

571
00:45:11.241 --> 00:45:13.410
At least not for the first year or so.

572
00:45:13.444 --> 00:45:16.947
You're gonna have to let him warm up to you.

573
00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:20.784
He hates Caucasians, despises Americans,

574
00:45:20.818 --> 00:45:23.487
and has nothing but contempt for women.

575
00:45:25.956 --> 00:45:29.293
So in your case, it might take a little while.

576
00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.829
Adiós.

577
00:45:31.862 --> 00:45:33.197
(engine starts)

578
00:47:40.724 --> 00:47:42.059
A little.

579
00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:06.416
Yes, he is.

580
00:48:15.626 --> 00:48:18.195
I am proficient in tiger-crane style,

581
00:48:18.228 --> 00:48:19.630
and I am more than proficient

582
00:48:19.663 --> 00:48:22.399
in the exquisite art of the samurai sword.

583
00:48:22.432 --> 00:48:24.101
(scoffs)

584
00:48:33.777 --> 00:48:35.412
(laughs)

585
00:48:52.329 --> 00:48:54.031
(laughs)

586
00:50:34.631 --> 00:50:36.533
(laughs)

587
00:50:51.181 --> 00:50:53.483
(laughs)

588
00:51:50.607 --> 00:51:51.775
(laughs)

589
00:51:59.883 --> 00:52:02.352
(laughs)

590
00:52:04.588 --> 00:52:05.856
Argh!

591
00:52:08.892 --> 00:52:10.393
Argh!

592
00:52:24.808 --> 00:52:26.243
No, please don't!

593
00:52:26.276 --> 00:52:27.410
(laughs)

594
00:52:32.482 --> 00:52:33.650
Aaargh!

595
00:53:06.016 --> 00:53:07.350
Yes!

596
00:53:18.528 --> 00:53:20.797
(yells)

597
00:53:57.767 --> 00:53:59.369
(grunts)

598
00:54:00.337 --> 00:54:01.805
(grunts)

599
00:54:10.647 --> 00:54:12.549
(grunts)

600
00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:16.453
(grunts)

601
00:54:16.786 --> 00:54:18.555
(groans)

602
00:54:18.588 --> 00:54:20.824
(scoffs)

603
00:55:08.004 --> 00:55:10.940
(grunting)

604
00:55:10.974 --> 00:55:12.909
(gasping)

605
00:55:38.935 --> 00:55:41.938
(thunder)

606
00:56:11.067 --> 00:56:12.702
(chopsticks clatter)

607
01:00:02.699 --> 01:00:06.135
Come on, you bitch.

608
01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:09.739
(grunts)

609
01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:49.379
Okay, Pai Mei.

610
01:00:51.514 --> 01:00:53.983
Here I come.

611
01:00:56.786 --> 01:00:59.722
(grunts)

612
01:02:02.852 --> 01:02:05.955
(gasping)

613
01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:09.859
(wheezing)

614
01:02:21.938 --> 01:02:24.040
(gasping)

615
01:02:30.146 --> 01:02:33.316
(wheezing)

616
01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:05.581
May I have a glass of water, please?

617
01:04:11.647 --> 01:04:13.950
(bird shrieks)

618
01:05:32.561 --> 01:05:34.497
(Quincy Jones' "Ironside" playing)

619
01:05:44.206 --> 01:05:46.742
So that's a Texas funeral?

620
01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:48.277
Yep.

621
01:05:49.245 --> 01:05:51.113
I have to give it to ya, Budd.

622
01:05:51.147 --> 01:05:53.716
That's a pretty fucked-up way to die.

623
01:05:54.317 --> 01:05:57.353
What's the name on the grave she's buried under?

624
01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.588
Paula...

625
01:06:01.223 --> 01:06:03.159
Schultz.

626
01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:09.799
Can I look at the sword?

627
01:06:09.832 --> 01:06:13.269
That's my money right there in that red bag, isn't it?

628
01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:15.104
It sure is.

629
01:06:16.238 --> 01:06:18.441
Well, then, it's your sword now.

630
01:06:33.689 --> 01:06:37.159
(blender buzzing)

631
01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:40.062
What's that you said?

632
01:06:40.096 --> 01:06:42.598
So this is a Hattori Hanzo sword.

633
01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:44.767
That's a Hanzo sword, all right.

634
01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:47.603
Bill tells me you once had one of these of your own.

635
01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:51.173
Yeah, once.

636
01:06:51.474 --> 01:06:54.143
Yeah? How does this one compare to that?

637
01:07:03.386 --> 01:07:07.289
If you're gonna compare a Hanzo sword,

638
01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:11.327
you compare it to every other sword ever made--

639
01:07:12.261 --> 01:07:15.731
wasn't made-- by Hattori Hanzo.

640
01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:28.144
Here you go. Wrap your lips around that.

641
01:07:37.453 --> 01:07:38.754
So...

642
01:07:40.189 --> 01:07:41.857
which "R" are you filled with?

643
01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:44.727
What?

644
01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:49.799
They say

645
01:07:49.832 --> 01:07:53.636
the number one killer of old people

646
01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:56.439
is retirement.

647
01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.642
People got a job to do,

648
01:07:59.675 --> 01:08:04.613
they tend to live a little bit longer so they can do it.

649
01:08:05.614 --> 01:08:07.683
I've always figured that

650
01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:10.886
warriors and their enemies

651
01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:13.789
share the same relationship.

652
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:16.192
So now that you're not gonna have to face

653
01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:19.295
your enemy no more on the battlefield,

654
01:08:20.396 --> 01:08:23.766
which "R" ya filled with?

655
01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:27.570
Relief?

656
01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:31.574
Or regret?

657
01:08:33.275 --> 01:08:34.810
A little bit of both.

658
01:08:35.311 --> 01:08:37.313
Horseshit.

659
01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:41.884
I'm sure you do feel a little bit of both.

660
01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:45.554
But I know damn well that you feel one

661
01:08:45.588 --> 01:08:47.523
more than you feel the other.

662
01:08:48.557 --> 01:08:52.495
And the question was, which one is it?

663
01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:56.532
Regret.

664
01:08:57.566 --> 01:09:00.202
You know, you gotta hand it to the old girl.

665
01:09:00.236 --> 01:09:04.406
I never saw anybody Buffalo Bill the way she Buffaloed Bill.

666
01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:07.276
Bill thought she was so damn smart.

667
01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:09.278
And I tried to tell him

668
01:09:09.678 --> 01:09:12.548
she was just smart for a blonde.

669
01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.536
Thanks a bunch.

670
01:09:42.811 --> 01:09:45.281
(chuckles)

671
01:09:47.449 --> 01:09:48.951
(hissing)

672
01:09:50.286 --> 01:09:52.354
Argh! Argh!

673
01:10:02.298 --> 01:10:04.466
(groaning)

674
01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:18.981
Mmm.

675
01:10:19.515 --> 01:10:21.550
I'm sorry, Budd.

676
01:10:21.584 --> 01:10:23.319
That was rude of me, wasn't it?

677
01:10:23.819 --> 01:10:27.656
Budd, I'd like to introduce my friend, the black mamba.

678
01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:30.726
Black mamba, this is Budd.

679
01:10:31.594 --> 01:10:33.028
You know, before I picked that little fella up,

680
01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:35.598
I looked him up on the Internet.

681
01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:38.834
Fascinating creature, the black mamba.

682
01:10:39.635 --> 01:10:40.970
Listen to this.

683
01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:44.039
(groaning)

684
01:10:45.541 --> 01:10:47.977
"In Africa, the saying goes

685
01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:50.613
'In the bush, an elephant can kill you,

686
01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:52.014
a leopard can kill you,

687
01:10:52.047 --> 01:10:56.352
and a black mamba can kill you. But only with the mamba,

688
01:10:56.385 --> 01:10:59.288
and this has been true in Africa since the dawn of time,

689
01:10:59.622 --> 01:11:01.423
is death sure.'

690
01:11:01.457 --> 01:11:05.327
Hence its handle, 'death incarnate.'"

691
01:11:05.728 --> 01:11:07.062
Pretty cool, huh?

692
01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:12.801
"Its neurotoxic venom is one of nature's most effective poisons,

693
01:11:12.835 --> 01:11:16.438
acting on the nervous system, causing paralysis.

694
01:11:16.472 --> 01:11:19.942
The venom of a black mamba can kill a human being in four hours

695
01:11:19.975 --> 01:11:22.678
if, say, bitten on the ankle or the thumb.

696
01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:26.015
However, a bite to the face or torso

697
01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:29.852
can bring death from paralysis within 20 minutes."

698
01:11:29.885 --> 01:11:33.422
Now, you should listen to this, 'cause this concerns you.

699
01:11:34.923 --> 01:11:38.027
"The amount of venom that can be delivered from a single bite

700
01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:40.429
can be gargantuan."

701
01:11:41.063 --> 01:11:43.632
You know, I've always liked that word "gargantuan."

702
01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:47.803
I so rarely have an opportunity to use it in a sentence.

703
01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:50.005
"If not treated quickly with antivenom,

704
01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:52.975
ten to 15 milligrams can be fatal to human beings.

705
01:11:53.008 --> 01:11:55.711
However, the black mamba can deliver

706
01:11:55.744 --> 01:11:59.014
as much as 100 to 400 milligrams of venom

707
01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:00.549
from a single bite."

708
01:12:03.719 --> 01:12:05.654
Now...

709
01:12:06.722 --> 01:12:10.626
in these last agonizing minutes of life you have left,

710
01:12:11.193 --> 01:12:12.594
let me answer that question

711
01:12:12.628 --> 01:12:14.930
you asked earlier more thoroughly.

712
01:12:16.131 --> 01:12:17.633
(moaning)

713
01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:20.703
Right at this moment,

714
01:12:20.736 --> 01:12:24.707
the biggest "R" I feel is regret.

715
01:12:26.141 --> 01:12:28.844
Regret that maybe

716
01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:31.980
the greatest warrior I have ever met

717
01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:38.153
met her end at the hands of a bushwhackin', scrub,

718
01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:41.590
elky piece of shit like you.

719
01:12:44.059 --> 01:12:46.862
That woman deserved better.

720
01:12:48.797 --> 01:12:50.933
(moaning stops)

721
01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:28.437
(cellphone rings)

722
01:13:30.606 --> 01:13:31.807
Bill.

723
01:13:33.509 --> 01:13:35.577
I have some tragic news.

724
01:13:36.612 --> 01:13:39.548
Your brother's dead.

725
01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:41.216
I am so sorry, baby.

726
01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:45.754
She put a black mamba in his camper.

727
01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:48.624
I got her, sweetie. She's dead.

728
01:13:50.859 --> 01:13:52.795
Let me put it this way,

729
01:13:52.828 --> 01:13:54.963
you ever start feeling sentimental,

730
01:13:54.997 --> 01:13:57.166
go to Barstow, California.

731
01:13:57.199 --> 01:13:58.967
When you get here, walk into a florist

732
01:13:59.001 --> 01:14:00.903
and buy a bunch of flowers.

733
01:14:00.936 --> 01:14:04.239
Then you take those flowers to Huntington Cemetery

734
01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:06.008
on Fuller and Guadalupe,

735
01:14:06.041 --> 01:14:08.811
look for the headstone marked "Paula Schultz,"

736
01:14:08.844 --> 01:14:10.746
and lay them on the grave.

737
01:14:10.779 --> 01:14:14.116
'Cause you will be standing at the final resting place

738
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:16.618
of Beatrix Kiddo.

739
01:14:17.019 --> 01:14:18.921
-Marty Kitrosser? -Here.

740
01:14:18.954 --> 01:14:20.889
-Melanie Harrhouse? -Here.

741
01:14:20.923 --> 01:14:23.225
-Beatrix Kiddo? -Here.

742
01:14:23.792 --> 01:14:26.962
Look... I can be there in about four hours.

743
01:14:26.995 --> 01:14:29.064
Do you want me to come over?

744
01:14:29.731 --> 01:14:32.501
No, no, no, no. You need me, baby, I'm there.

745
01:14:35.804 --> 01:14:38.674
Okay. I'm leaving now.

746
01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:41.844
You go smoke some pot or somethin'. I'll be there soon.

747
01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:16.144
(both grunting)

748
01:15:43.272 --> 01:15:44.706
Ugh.

749
01:15:45.674 --> 01:15:47.075
Gross.

750
01:16:07.296 --> 01:16:10.165
Yaagh!

751
01:16:17.205 --> 01:16:18.774
Agh!

752
01:16:58.313 --> 01:17:00.248
Hi-ya!

753
01:17:10.258 --> 01:17:13.428
"To my brother, Budd. The only man I ever loved.

754
01:17:13.996 --> 01:17:15.397
Bill."

755
01:17:26.274 --> 01:17:28.377
What's that?

756
01:17:30.078 --> 01:17:32.447
Budd's Hanzo sword.

757
01:17:33.248 --> 01:17:35.117
He said he pawned it.

758
01:17:35.817 --> 01:17:38.720
Guess that makes him a liar now, don't it?

759
01:17:42.424 --> 01:17:43.859
Elle?

760
01:17:44.126 --> 01:17:45.293
Bea.

761
01:17:46.194 --> 01:17:48.797
Somethin' I've always been curious about.

762
01:17:49.197 --> 01:17:53.035
Just between us girls,

763
01:17:53.068 --> 01:17:57.205
what did you say to Pai Mei to make him snatch out your eye?

764
01:17:57.239 --> 01:17:58.707
Argh! Ow! Ow!

765
01:18:00.976 --> 01:18:04.413
I called him a miserable old fool.

766
01:18:05.213 --> 01:18:07.115
Ooh.

767
01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:09.151
Bad idea.

768
01:18:09.551 --> 01:18:11.987
ELLE: Know what I did?

769
01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:15.724
I killed that miserable old fool.

770
01:18:17.492 --> 01:18:20.762
ELLE: How do you like the fish head, you miserable old fool?

771
01:18:20.796 --> 01:18:22.497
I poisoned his fish heads.

772
01:18:27.035 --> 01:18:28.804
(Elle laughs)

773
01:18:33.475 --> 01:18:35.277
And I told him

774
01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:39.247
"To me, the word of an old fool like you

775
01:18:39.281 --> 01:18:43.185
is worth less than nothing."

776
01:18:43.218 --> 01:18:44.920
(laughs)

777
01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:50.092
That's right.

778
01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:52.160
I killed your master.

779
01:18:52.194 --> 01:18:54.262
And now I'm gonna kill you, too.

780
01:18:54.963 --> 01:18:57.532
With your own sword, no less.

781
01:18:57.566 --> 01:19:03.038
Which, in the very immediate future, will become my sword.

782
01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:07.275
Bitch.

783
01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:09.778
You don't have a future.

784
01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:42.244
(screams)

785
01:19:53.522 --> 01:19:56.291
(screams)

786
01:20:00.028 --> 01:20:02.330
You bitch!

787
01:20:05.133 --> 01:20:07.369
It hurts! You bitch!

788
01:20:14.609 --> 01:20:17.946
I'll kill you! Give it back!

789
01:20:20.515 --> 01:20:23.084
You-- You bitch!

790
01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:25.587
(moaning continues)

791
01:20:28.356 --> 01:20:30.458
ELLE: I'm going to kill you, you bitch!

792
01:20:31.226 --> 01:20:32.594
(hisses)

793
01:20:33.094 --> 01:20:35.263
ELLE: Oh, I'll get you!

794
01:20:36.398 --> 01:20:38.300
I'm gonna...

795
01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:42.470
Where are you? Lemme at you!

796
01:20:45.073 --> 01:20:48.276
ELLE: Where are you? I'm coming, you fucking bitch!

797
01:20:49.044 --> 01:20:51.613
You're fucking dead! You're fucking dead!

798
01:22:24.739 --> 01:22:27.042
BEATRIX: Like most men who never knew their father,

799
01:22:27.075 --> 01:22:29.544
Bill collected father figures.

800
01:22:29.577 --> 01:22:33.114
The first was Esteban Vallejo.

801
01:22:33.148 --> 01:22:36.284
Esteban was a pimp and a friend of Bill's mother.

802
01:22:36.818 --> 01:22:40.388
He ran a brothel in Acuna, Mexico, for over 50 years.

803
01:22:41.089 --> 01:22:43.325
His army, the Acuna boys,

804
01:22:43.358 --> 01:22:46.194
made up of the fatherless offspring of his whores,

805
01:22:46.227 --> 01:22:47.429
ran Acuna.

806
01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:50.265
He ran the Acuna boys.

807
01:22:52.167 --> 01:22:54.069
Now, at the age of 80,

808
01:22:54.102 --> 01:22:56.371
it would be this retired gentleman of leisure

809
01:22:57.172 --> 01:23:00.075
who could point me in Bill's direction.

810
01:23:02.344 --> 01:23:05.046
BEATRIX: Señor Esteban Vallejo?

811
01:23:06.247 --> 01:23:09.484
-Yes. -May I join you?

812
01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:15.023
Only on the condition that you call me Esteban.

813
01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:17.759
May I join you, Esteban?

814
01:23:17.792 --> 01:23:19.294
Please.

815
01:23:23.398 --> 01:23:25.300
¿Americana?

816
01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:27.068
Yes.

817
01:23:27.102 --> 01:23:29.604
I speak a little Spanish, if you prefer.

818
01:23:29.637 --> 01:23:33.575
No, no, no, no. I prefer English.

819
01:23:33.608 --> 01:23:36.077
I haven't spoken it in a while,

820
01:23:36.111 --> 01:23:39.614
but I would relish the opportunity to converse

821
01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:42.450
with such a pretty companion as yourself.

822
01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:44.519
It's my pleasure to be in the company

823
01:23:44.552 --> 01:23:46.855
of such a fine gentleman as yourself.

824
01:23:46.888 --> 01:23:49.758
I must warn you, young lady,

825
01:23:49.791 --> 01:23:53.128
I am susceptible to flattery.

826
01:23:56.131 --> 01:23:58.166
How may I be of service to you?

827
01:24:06.408 --> 01:24:07.776
Where's Bill?

828
01:24:10.612 --> 01:24:12.414
Ahh.

829
01:24:12.914 --> 01:24:15.283
You must be Beatrix.

830
01:24:17.285 --> 01:24:19.454
I can see the attraction.

831
01:24:22.223 --> 01:24:25.460
I remember when Bill was only five years old,

832
01:24:25.493 --> 01:24:27.629
I took him to the movies.

833
01:24:27.662 --> 01:24:31.433
It was a movie starring Lana Turner.

834
01:24:31.466 --> 01:24:36.404
The Postman Always Ring Twice, with John Garfields.

835
01:24:36.438 --> 01:24:39.641
And whenever she would appear on the screen,

836
01:24:39.674 --> 01:24:42.911
Bill would begin compulsively to suck his thumb

837
01:24:42.944 --> 01:24:45.380
to an obscene amount.

838
01:24:45.413 --> 01:24:47.482
And I knew from this very moment

839
01:24:47.515 --> 01:24:51.186
this boy was a fool for blondes.

840
01:24:56.691 --> 01:24:58.493
Mmm.

841
01:24:58.526 --> 01:25:00.328
You know,

842
01:25:00.361 --> 01:25:04.432
being a fool for a woman such as yourself

843
01:25:04.466 --> 01:25:07.836
is always the right thing to do.

844
01:25:09.804 --> 01:25:14.776
If we had met when I was back in business,

845
01:25:14.809 --> 01:25:19.347
you would have been my number one lady.

846
01:25:21.749 --> 01:25:23.618
Well, I'm flattered.

847
01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:26.888
You goddamn well better be.

848
01:25:27.822 --> 01:25:31.292
This... I heard you were driving a truck.

849
01:25:32.427 --> 01:25:34.529
My Pussy Wagon died on me.

850
01:25:35.396 --> 01:25:38.500
The pussy died. Hmm.

851
01:25:41.302 --> 01:25:44.205
Bill shot you in the head, no?

852
01:25:44.606 --> 01:25:46.641
-Yes. -Hmm.

853
01:25:47.909 --> 01:25:51.212
I would have been much nicer.

854
01:25:51.246 --> 01:25:53.515
I would have just cut your face.

855
01:25:56.384 --> 01:25:58.253
You must forgive me.

856
01:25:58.286 --> 01:26:02.757
Please, you have a drink with me.

857
01:26:04.292 --> 01:26:06.961
Clara!

858
01:26:09.797 --> 01:26:10.965
CLARA: Coming.

859
01:26:14.402 --> 01:26:15.970
Dos añejo.

860
01:26:17.805 --> 01:26:19.240
(mumbles)

861
01:26:28.616 --> 01:26:29.951
Gracias.

862
01:26:35.657 --> 01:26:38.593
What were we talking about?

863
01:26:44.799 --> 01:26:46.367
Bill.

864
01:26:48.636 --> 01:26:50.271
Where's Bill?

865
01:26:50.605 --> 01:26:54.342
Where's Bill? Yeah. Hmm.

866
01:26:55.343 --> 01:27:00.748
Bill is at the Villa Quatro, on the road to Salina.

867
01:27:00.782 --> 01:27:04.652
I will draw you a map.

868
01:27:04.686 --> 01:27:07.021
Bill is like a son to me.

869
01:27:08.656 --> 01:27:11.326
Do you know why I help you?

870
01:27:11.359 --> 01:27:12.760
No.

871
01:27:12.994 --> 01:27:14.963
Because he would want me to.

872
01:27:16.097 --> 01:27:18.333
Now, that I don't believe.

873
01:27:18.366 --> 01:27:20.702
Ahh.

874
01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:24.973
How else is he ever going to see you again?

875
01:28:33.708 --> 01:28:35.009
Freeze, Mommy.

876
01:28:35.043 --> 01:28:37.745
Bang, bang! Oh!

877
01:28:37.779 --> 01:28:40.548
Oh! She got us, B.B. Mommy got us.

878
01:28:40.581 --> 01:28:42.116
Oh, I'm dying.

879
01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:44.719
(groans) I'm dying.

880
01:28:47.555 --> 01:28:51.025
Fall down, sweetheart. Mommy shot us.

881
01:28:52.827 --> 01:28:55.963
BILL: But little did Quickdraw Kiddo know

882
01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:59.067
that little B.B. was only playing possum,

883
01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:03.938
due to the fact that she was impervious to bullets.

884
01:29:03.971 --> 01:29:06.140
I am pervious to bullets, Mommy.

885
01:29:06.174 --> 01:29:10.078
Hey, get back down there. You're playing possum.

886
01:29:10.111 --> 01:29:15.850
So, as the smirking killer advanced on what she thought

887
01:29:15.883 --> 01:29:22.023
was a bullet-ridden corpse, that's when little B.B. fired.

888
01:29:23.958 --> 01:29:25.126
Bang, bang!

889
01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:36.804
You're dead, Mommy. So die.

890
01:29:37.772 --> 01:29:39.741
Oh!

891
01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:44.412
B.B.

892
01:29:47.248 --> 01:29:51.519
Oh, B.B.

893
01:29:51.552 --> 01:29:53.621
(grunts)

894
01:29:53.654 --> 01:29:56.758
I should've known.

895
01:29:56.791 --> 01:29:58.559
You are the best.

896
01:30:06.968 --> 01:30:10.071
Oh, Mommy. Don't die.

897
01:30:10.104 --> 01:30:13.074
I was just playing.

898
01:30:17.678 --> 01:30:19.046
I know.

899
01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:35.463
BILL: I told her that you were asleep,

900
01:30:36.197 --> 01:30:40.234
but that one day you'd wake up and come back to her.

901
01:30:41.202 --> 01:30:45.506
And she asked me, "If Mommy's been asleep since I was born,

902
01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:48.176
then how will she know what I look like?"

903
01:30:48.209 --> 01:30:55.183
To which I replied, "Because Mommy's been dreaming of you."

904
01:30:56.150 --> 01:30:58.853
BILL: That's what I said.

905
01:30:58.886 --> 01:31:02.223
Did you dream of me? I dreamed of you.

906
01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:07.028
Every single night, baby. Every single night.

907
01:31:07.061 --> 01:31:10.765
I waited a long time for you to wake up, Mommy.

908
01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:25.980
Now, let me look at you.

909
01:31:26.013 --> 01:31:28.182
Oh.

910
01:31:31.752 --> 01:31:35.323
My, my, my, what a pretty little girl you are.

911
01:31:35.356 --> 01:31:37.091
You're pretty too, Mommy.

912
01:31:43.598 --> 01:31:47.134
Tell mommy what you said when I showed you her picture.

913
01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:48.569
Mm-mm.

914
01:31:48.603 --> 01:31:51.172
-Come on, shy girl. -Mm-mm.

915
01:31:51.205 --> 01:31:53.941
Come on. You know what you said.

916
01:31:53.975 --> 01:31:57.345
Come on. Tell Mommy. It'll make her feel good.

917
01:31:57.378 --> 01:31:59.347
-Come on. -Mm-mm.

918
01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:01.015
Yeah. Come on.

919
01:32:01.048 --> 01:32:03.184
I said... I said

920
01:32:03.217 --> 01:32:05.686
"You're the most beautifulest woman

921
01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:10.691
I ever saw in the whole wide world."

922
01:32:11.125 --> 01:32:14.896
That's the truth. That's what she said.

923
01:32:15.663 --> 01:32:19.934
B.B., don't you think Mommy has the prettiest hair

924
01:32:19.967 --> 01:32:21.702
in the whole wide world?

925
01:32:21.736 --> 01:32:23.604
Yes, I do.

926
01:32:23.638 --> 01:32:25.606
Matter of fact, it's better than pretty.

927
01:32:27.041 --> 01:32:28.843
What's better than pretty?

928
01:32:28.876 --> 01:32:32.013
Mmm... gorgeous.

929
01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:35.616
Very good. Gorgeous.

930
01:32:35.650 --> 01:32:36.817
Mommy is gorgeous.

931
01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:42.390
Hmm. You know, sweetie,

932
01:32:42.423 --> 01:32:44.692
mommy's kinda mad at daddy.

933
01:32:44.725 --> 01:32:47.662
Why, daddy? Were you being a bad daddy?

934
01:32:47.695 --> 01:32:50.965
I'm afraid I was. I was a real bad daddy.

935
01:32:53.434 --> 01:32:58.005
Our little girl learned about life and death the other day.

936
01:32:58.039 --> 01:33:01.375
Wanna tell mommy about what happened to Emilio?

937
01:33:04.078 --> 01:33:07.081
I killed him.

938
01:33:07.114 --> 01:33:08.983
Emilio was her goldfish.

939
01:33:09.016 --> 01:33:12.353
Emilio was my goldfiss.

940
01:33:12.386 --> 01:33:14.956
She came running into my room,

941
01:33:14.989 --> 01:33:17.124
holding the fish in her hand and crying,

942
01:33:17.158 --> 01:33:20.027
"Daddy! Daddy! Emilio's dead."

943
01:33:21.963 --> 01:33:25.933
And I said, "Really? That's so sad."

944
01:33:25.967 --> 01:33:28.235
"How did he die?"

945
01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:29.837
And what did you say?

946
01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:31.205
I stepped on him.

947
01:33:31.238 --> 01:33:32.907
Actually, young lady,

948
01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:36.344
the words you so strategically used were

949
01:33:36.377 --> 01:33:39.780
"I accidentally stepped on him."

950
01:33:41.148 --> 01:33:42.683
To which I queried,

951
01:33:42.717 --> 01:33:45.319
"And just how did your foot accidentally

952
01:33:45.353 --> 01:33:48.022
find its way into Emilio's fishbowl?"

953
01:33:48.055 --> 01:33:49.390
And she said, "No, no, no.

954
01:33:49.423 --> 01:33:52.760
Emilio was on the carpet when I stepped on him."

955
01:33:52.793 --> 01:33:56.731
Mmm. The plot thickens.

956
01:33:56.764 --> 01:34:01.435
"And just how did Emilio get on the carpet?"

957
01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:05.339
And, mommy, you would've been so proud of her.

958
01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:09.477
She didn't lie.

959
01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:13.814
She said she took Emilio out of his bowl

960
01:34:13.848 --> 01:34:16.117
and put him on the carpet.

961
01:34:19.086 --> 01:34:21.322
And what was Emilio doing on the carpet?

962
01:34:23.224 --> 01:34:25.059
Flapping.

963
01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:27.895
And then you stomped on him.

964
01:34:27.928 --> 01:34:29.430
Uh-huh.

965
01:34:29.897 --> 01:34:33.401
And when you lifted up your foot,

966
01:34:33.434 --> 01:34:35.102
what was Emilio doing then?

967
01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:37.738
Nothing.

968
01:34:37.772 --> 01:34:40.374
He stopped flapping, didn't he?

969
01:34:43.044 --> 01:34:45.780
She told me later

970
01:34:45.813 --> 01:34:48.049
that the second she lifted up her foot

971
01:34:48.082 --> 01:34:52.286
and saw Emilio not flapping, she knew what she had done.

972
01:34:52.319 --> 01:34:57.024
Is that not the perfect visual image of life and death?

973
01:34:57.058 --> 01:34:59.260
A fish flapping on the carpet,

974
01:35:00.027 --> 01:35:02.963
and a fish not flapping on the carpet.

975
01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:07.501
So powerful, even a four-year-old

976
01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:11.972
with no concept of life or death knew what it meant.

977
01:35:14.141 --> 01:35:15.843
You loved Emilio, didn't you?

978
01:35:15.876 --> 01:35:17.311
Uh-huh.

979
01:35:17.344 --> 01:35:21.248
Well, I love mommy, too.

980
01:35:21.916 --> 01:35:24.218
But I did to mommy what you did to Emilio.

981
01:35:24.251 --> 01:35:28.089
-You stomped on mommy? -Worse.

982
01:35:28.122 --> 01:35:30.191
I shot mommy.

983
01:35:30.224 --> 01:35:33.394
Not pretend shooting like we were just doing.

984
01:35:33.427 --> 01:35:35.362
I shot her for real.

985
01:35:35.396 --> 01:35:37.998
Why? Did you want to see what would happen?

986
01:35:38.032 --> 01:35:42.103
No, I knew what would happen to mommy if I shot her.

987
01:35:42.503 --> 01:35:44.872
What I didn't know was,

988
01:35:44.905 --> 01:35:47.374
when I shot mommy, what would happen to me.

989
01:35:47.408 --> 01:35:49.043
What happened?

990
01:35:49.076 --> 01:35:51.812
I was very sad.

991
01:35:53.114 --> 01:35:55.449
And that's when I learned

992
01:35:55.483 --> 01:35:59.420
some things, once you do, they can never be undone.

993
01:36:03.958 --> 01:36:05.493
What happened to mommy?

994
01:36:07.394 --> 01:36:09.029
Why don't you ask mommy?

995
01:36:09.063 --> 01:36:12.233
You okay, mommy? Does it hurt?

996
01:36:12.266 --> 01:36:13.968
No, sweetie.

997
01:36:16.003 --> 01:36:18.539
Doesn't hurt anymore.

998
01:36:23.477 --> 01:36:26.547
Did it make you sick?

999
01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:30.918
No. It made me sleep.

1000
01:36:31.919 --> 01:36:34.355
That's why I haven't been with you, B.B. I've been asleep.

1001
01:36:34.388 --> 01:36:38.092
But you're awake now, mommy. Right?

1002
01:36:38.125 --> 01:36:41.462
I'm wide awake, pretty girl.

1003
01:36:41.495 --> 01:36:43.931
B.B., would you like mommy

1004
01:36:43.964 --> 01:36:46.934
to watch a video with you before sleepy time?

1005
01:36:46.967 --> 01:36:50.404
Uh-huh. Mommy, do you wanna watch a video with me

1006
01:36:50.437 --> 01:36:52.273
before sleepy time?

1007
01:36:52.306 --> 01:36:55.075
Oh, yeah! I would love to.

1008
01:36:55.476 --> 01:36:57.878
-Which one do you wanna watch? -Shogun Assassin.

1009
01:36:57.912 --> 01:37:00.314
No, B.B. Shogun Assassin is too long.

1010
01:37:00.347 --> 01:37:02.149
Mm-mm.

1011
01:37:02.917 --> 01:37:04.552
No, it's not.

1012
01:37:04.585 --> 01:37:07.054
Well, then,

1013
01:37:07.087 --> 01:37:09.356
I'll leave you ladies to it.

1014
01:37:15.696 --> 01:37:20.334
(BOY on TV) When I was little, my father was famous.

1015
01:37:21.235 --> 01:37:25.506
He was the greatest samurai in the empire.

1016
01:37:25.539 --> 01:37:29.043
And he was the shogun's decapitator.

1017
01:37:29.076 --> 01:37:34.248
He cut off the heads of 131 lords.

1018
01:37:34.281 --> 01:37:36.951
My father would come home to mother,

1019
01:37:36.984 --> 01:37:38.986
and when he would see her

1020
01:37:39.019 --> 01:37:41.989
he would forget about the killings.

1021
01:37:42.022 --> 01:37:44.058
He wasn't scared of the shogun,

1022
01:37:44.091 --> 01:37:47.127
but the shogun was scared of him.

1023
01:37:47.161 --> 01:37:49.496
Maybe that was the problem.

1024
01:37:49.530 --> 01:37:52.933
One night, the shogun sent...

BILL: I was just admiring your sword.

1059
01:40:18.579 --> 01:40:21.048
Quite a piece of work.

1060
01:40:21.482 --> 01:40:25.519
Speaking of which, how is Hanzo-san?

1061
01:40:25.552 --> 01:40:27.187
He's good.

1062
01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:31.091
Has his sushi gotten any better?

1063
01:40:35.262 --> 01:40:36.830
You know, I couldn't believe it.

1064
01:40:36.864 --> 01:40:39.867
You got him to make you a sword.

1065
01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:41.301
It was easy.

1066
01:40:42.269 --> 01:40:44.538
I just dropped your name, Bill.

1067
01:40:44.571 --> 01:40:46.573
Ha. That'd do it.

1068
01:40:59.853 --> 01:41:01.889

I suppose the idea is we cross Hanzo swords.

1073
01:41:21.942 --> 01:41:23.310
Am I right?

1074
01:41:25.179 --> 01:41:28.482
Well, it just so happens

1075
01:41:28.515 --> 01:41:31.585
this hacienda has its own private beach.

1076
01:41:31.618 --> 01:41:33.754
And that private beach just so happens

1077
01:41:33.787 --> 01:41:38.826
to look particularly beautiful bathed in moonlight.

1078
01:41:39.426 --> 01:41:42.229
And there just so happens to be a full moon out tonight.

1079
01:41:42.262 --> 01:41:45.165
So, sword fighter,

1080
01:41:45.199 --> 01:41:48.902
if you want a sword fight, that's where I suggest.

1081
01:41:49.536 --> 01:41:53.340
But if you wanna be old school about it,

1082
01:41:53.373 --> 01:41:56.443
and you know I'm all about old school,

1083
01:41:56.910 --> 01:41:58.712
then we could wait until dawn

1084
01:41:58.745 --> 01:42:00.848
and slice each other up at sunrise

1085
01:42:00.881 --> 01:42:02.716
like a couple of real-life, honest...

1086
01:42:05.419 --> 01:42:07.554
Now, if you don't settle down,

1087
01:42:07.588 --> 01:42:09.923
I'm gonna have to put one in your kneecap.

1088
01:42:10.524 --> 01:42:13.594
And I hear tell that's a very painful place to get shot in.

1089
01:42:14.828 --> 01:42:17.598
(laughs)

1090
01:42:18.298 --> 01:42:19.833
I'm just fuckin' with you.

1091
01:42:21.435 --> 01:42:25.639
Now, when it comes to you...

1092
01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:28.242
and us...

1093
01:42:29.710 --> 01:42:32.980
I have a few unanswered questions.

1094
01:42:33.013 --> 01:42:36.850
So, before this tale of bloody revenge

1095
01:42:36.884 --> 01:42:39.419
reaches its climax,

1096
01:42:39.453 --> 01:42:42.222
I'm gonna ask you some questions,

1097
01:42:42.256 --> 01:42:44.825
and I want you to tell me the truth.

1098
01:42:44.858 --> 01:42:47.661
However, therein lies a dilemma.

1099
01:42:49.296 --> 01:42:52.299
Because when it comes to the subject of me,

1100
01:42:52.332 --> 01:42:55.335
I believe you are truly and utterly

1101
01:42:55.369 --> 01:42:57.404
incapable of telling the truth.

1102
01:42:57.437 --> 01:43:01.975
Especially to me. And least of all, to yourself.

1103
01:43:02.009 --> 01:43:05.312
And when it comes to the subject of me,

1104
01:43:05.345 --> 01:43:07.581
I am truly and utterly

1105
01:43:07.614 --> 01:43:12.252
incapable of believing anything you say.

1106
01:43:12.286 --> 01:43:14.288
BEATRIX: How do you suppose we solve this dilemma?

1107
01:43:14.321 --> 01:43:18.492
Well, it just so happens,

1108
01:43:18.525 --> 01:43:19.760
I have a solution.

1109
01:43:19.793 --> 01:43:22.763
-BEATRIX: Agh! -Gotcha!

1110
01:43:22.796 --> 01:43:24.998
(grunting) God!

1111
01:43:25.032 --> 01:43:27.601
(Bill laughs)

1112
01:43:27.634 --> 01:43:31.271
What the fuck did you just shoot me with?

1113
01:43:31.305 --> 01:43:34.374
My greatest invention. Or at least my favorite.

1114
01:43:35.442 --> 01:43:36.743
Don't touch it,

1115
01:43:36.777 --> 01:43:38.679
or I'll stick another one right in your cheek.

1116
01:43:42.983 --> 01:43:45.586
What lies within that dart,

1117
01:43:45.619 --> 01:43:49.323
just begging to course its way through your veins

1118
01:43:49.356 --> 01:43:51.291
is an incredibly potent

1119
01:43:51.325 --> 01:43:53.927
and quite infallible truth serum.

1120
01:43:53.961 --> 01:43:57.297
I call it "The undisputed truth."

1121
01:43:57.331 --> 01:43:59.666
Twice as strong as sodium pentothal,

1122
01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:01.735
with no druggy aftereffects.

1123
01:44:02.769 --> 01:44:08.375
Except for a slight wave of euphoria. You feel it?

1124
01:44:09.076 --> 01:44:11.612
-Euphoria? -BILL: Yeah.

1125
01:44:11.645 --> 01:44:13.914
-No. -Too bad.

1126
01:44:15.682 --> 01:44:18.018
As you know,

1127
01:44:18.051 --> 01:44:21.321
I'm quite keen on comic books.

1128
01:44:22.556 --> 01:44:25.359
Especially the ones about superheroes.

1129
01:44:25.392 --> 01:44:27.527
I find the whole mythology

1130
01:44:27.561 --> 01:44:30.831
surrounding superheroes fascinating.

1131
01:44:30.864 --> 01:44:35.702
Take my favorite superhero, Superman.

1132
01:44:35.736 --> 01:44:38.739
Not a great comic book. Not particularly well drawn.

1133
01:44:40.407 --> 01:44:42.075
Mmm.

1134
01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:44.544
But the mythology...

1135
01:44:44.578 --> 01:44:48.048
the mythology is not only great, it's unique.

1136
01:44:48.749 --> 01:44:51.918
How long does this shit take to go into effect?

1137
01:44:52.519 --> 01:44:53.453
About two minutes.

1138
01:44:53.487 --> 01:44:56.423
Just long enough for me to finish my point.

1139
01:44:56.456 --> 01:45:01.395
Now, a staple of the superhero mythology is,

1140
01:45:01.428 --> 01:45:04.631
there's the superhero and there's the alter ego.

1141
01:45:04.665 --> 01:45:06.900
Batman is actually Bruce Wayne,

1142
01:45:06.933 --> 01:45:09.036
Spider-man is actually Peter Parker.

1143
01:45:09.936 --> 01:45:12.139
When that character wakes up in the morning,

1144
01:45:12.172 --> 01:45:14.574
he's Peter Parker.

1145
01:45:14.608 --> 01:45:19.479
He has to put on a costume to become Spider-man.

1146
01:45:19.513 --> 01:45:25.452
And it is in that characteristic Superman stands alone.

1147
01:45:25.485 --> 01:45:28.021
Superman didn't become Superman.

1148
01:45:28.055 --> 01:45:30.957
Superman was born Superman.

1149
01:45:30.991 --> 01:45:35.162
When Superman wakes up in the morning, he's Superman.

1150
01:45:35.195 --> 01:45:38.065
His alter ego is Clark Kent.

1151
01:45:38.832 --> 01:45:42.035
His outfit with the big red "S,"

1152
01:45:42.069 --> 01:45:44.504
that's the blanket he was wrapped in as a baby

1153
01:45:44.538 --> 01:45:48.742
when the Kents found him. Those are his clothes.

1154
01:45:48.775 --> 01:45:52.079
What Kent wears-- the glasses, the business suit,

1155
01:45:52.112 --> 01:45:53.980
that's the costume.

1156
01:45:54.014 --> 01:45:58.518
That's the costume Superman wears to blend in with us.

1157
01:46:00.187 --> 01:46:03.824
Clark Kent is how Superman views us.

1158
01:46:03.857 --> 01:46:07.127
And what are the characteristics of Clark Kent?

1159
01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:09.696
He's weak,

1160
01:46:09.730 --> 01:46:12.733
he's unsure of himself,

1161
01:46:12.766 --> 01:46:14.501
he's a coward.

1162
01:46:15.469 --> 01:46:17.771
Clark Kent is Superman's critique

1163
01:46:17.804 --> 01:46:20.841
on the whole human race.

1164
01:46:22.142 --> 01:46:26.947
Sorta like Beatrix Kiddo and Mrs. Tommy Plympton.

1165
01:46:27.981 --> 01:46:30.150
Ah, so.

1166
01:46:30.183 --> 01:46:32.419
The point emerges.

1167
01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:37.758
You would've worn the costume of Arlene Plympton.

1168
01:46:37.791 --> 01:46:41.728
But you were born Beatrix Kiddo.

1169
01:46:41.762 --> 01:46:44.197
And every morning when you woke up,

1170
01:46:44.231 --> 01:46:46.666
you'd still be Beatrix Kiddo.

1171
01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:48.668
Oh, you can take the needle out.

1172
01:46:56.042 --> 01:46:58.145
Are you calling me a superhero?

1173
01:46:58.178 --> 01:47:00.847
I'm calling you a killer.

1174
01:47:00.881 --> 01:47:03.884
A natural-born killer.

1175
01:47:03.917 --> 01:47:07.521
You always have been, and you always will be.

1176
01:47:07.554 --> 01:47:09.689
Moving to El Paso,

1177
01:47:09.723 --> 01:47:12.959
working in a used-record store,

1178
01:47:12.993 --> 01:47:17.230
goin' to the movies with Tommy, clipping coupons.

1179
01:47:17.264 --> 01:47:19.232
That's you

1180
01:47:19.266 --> 01:47:22.736
trying to disguise yourself as a worker bee.

1181
01:47:22.769 --> 01:47:25.939
That's you tryin' to blend in with the hive.

1182
01:47:25.972 --> 01:47:29.209
But you're not a worker bee.

1183
01:47:29.242 --> 01:47:32.212
You're a renegade killer bee.

1184
01:47:32.245 --> 01:47:35.282
And no matter how much beer you drank or barbecue you ate

1185
01:47:35.315 --> 01:47:38.552
or how fat your ass got,

1186
01:47:38.585 --> 01:47:42.489
nothing in the world would ever change that.

1187
01:47:44.858 --> 01:47:48.962
First question:

1188
01:47:48.995 --> 01:47:53.700
Did you really think your life in El Paso was gonna work?

1189
01:48:00.006 --> 01:48:01.541
No!

1190
01:48:05.278 --> 01:48:08.582
But I would've had B.B.!

1191
01:48:08.849 --> 01:48:11.051
Don't get me wrong.

1192
01:48:11.084 --> 01:48:15.055
I think you would have been a wonderful mother.

1193
01:48:15.088 --> 01:48:16.923
But you are a killer.

1194
01:48:21.761 --> 01:48:24.831
All those people you killed to get to me

1195
01:48:24.865 --> 01:48:27.200
felt damn good, didn't they?

1196
01:48:29.069 --> 01:48:31.705
Yes.

1197
01:48:31.738 --> 01:48:34.040
Every single one of them?

1198
01:48:44.050 --> 01:48:45.619
Yes.

1199
01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:52.092
That was the warmup round.

1200
01:48:52.125 --> 01:48:57.063
Now comes the $64,000 question.

1201
01:49:04.037 --> 01:49:07.741
Why did you run away from me with my baby?

1202
01:49:11.778 --> 01:49:15.315
Do you remember the last assignment you sent me on?

1203
01:49:15.348 --> 01:49:17.684
Of course.

1204
01:49:17.717 --> 01:49:19.786
Lisa Wong.

1205
01:49:20.954 --> 01:49:25.191
The morning I left, I was sick.

1206
01:49:25.225 --> 01:49:30.196
On the plane, I threw up.

1207
01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:33.833
So I started thinking

1208
01:49:33.867 --> 01:49:35.969
maybe I was pregnant.

1209
01:49:36.002 --> 01:49:38.705
"Easy to use. Remove cap and urinate

1210
01:49:38.738 --> 01:49:40.307
on the absorbent end for five seconds."

1211
01:49:42.309 --> 01:49:44.644
"Accurate results in only 90 seconds.

1212
01:49:44.678 --> 01:49:46.046
You can read the results

1213
01:49:46.079 --> 01:49:48.014
as soon as the line appears in the window."

1214
01:49:48.048 --> 01:49:49.215
(sighs)

1215
01:49:49.249 --> 01:49:52.285
(clock ticking)

1216
01:50:24.718 --> 01:50:25.885
Fuck.

1217
01:50:25.919 --> 01:50:28.154
BEATRIX: What I didn't know

1218
01:50:28.188 --> 01:50:29.689
was that somewhere on my journey

1219
01:50:29.723 --> 01:50:32.325
I had been spotted.

1220
01:50:32.359 --> 01:50:35.862
With me in L.A., it didn't take Lisa Wong long

1221
01:50:35.895 --> 01:50:38.431
to send an assassin of her own.

1222
01:50:38.465 --> 01:50:39.566
(doorbell)

1223
01:50:39.599 --> 01:50:42.769
-BEATRIX: Hello, can I help you? -Hello, I'm Karen Kim.

1224
01:50:42.802 --> 01:50:44.404
I'm the hospitality manager of the hotel.

1225
01:50:44.437 --> 01:50:46.239
I have a welcome gift from the management.

1226
01:50:46.272 --> 01:50:49.776
Oh, that's nice. Um...

1227
01:50:49.809 --> 01:50:51.211
Can you just leave it by the door?

1228
01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:05.258
You pretty good with that shotgun?

1229
01:51:05.291 --> 01:51:06.993
Not that I have to be at this range,

1230
01:51:07.027 --> 01:51:09.829
but I'm a fucking surgeon with this shotgun.

1231
01:51:09.863 --> 01:51:12.232
Well, guess what, bitch? I'm better than Annie Oakley,

1232
01:51:12.265 --> 01:51:14.334
and I got you right in my sight.

1233
01:51:14.367 --> 01:51:16.202
I could blow your fucking head off.

1234
01:51:16.236 --> 01:51:18.371
Not before I put one right between your eyes,

1235
01:51:18.405 --> 01:51:20.306
so let's talk.

1236
01:51:22.409 --> 01:51:24.010
Karen...

1237
01:51:26.112 --> 01:51:28.815
I just found out

1238
01:51:28.848 --> 01:51:30.750
right now,

1239
01:51:30.784 --> 01:51:35.822
not a moment before you blew a hole through the door,

1240
01:51:36.423 --> 01:51:38.324
that I'm pregnant.

1241
01:51:38.358 --> 01:51:39.893
What is this?

1242
01:51:41.061 --> 01:51:43.930
On the floor by the door

1243
01:51:43.963 --> 01:51:47.100
is a strip that says I'm pregnant.

1244
01:51:47.133 --> 01:51:48.735
Bullshit.

1245
01:51:49.402 --> 01:51:53.406
Any other time you'd be 100% right.

1246
01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:54.774
But this time,

1247
01:51:56.409 --> 01:51:58.178
you're 100% wrong.

1248
01:52:00.413 --> 01:52:03.383
I'm the deadliest woman in the world.

1249
01:52:04.417 --> 01:52:06.786
But right now,

1250
01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:09.255
I'm just scared shitless for my baby.

1251
01:52:10.123 --> 01:52:12.058
Please.

1252
01:52:13.059 --> 01:52:15.462
Just look at the strip.

1253
01:52:17.464 --> 01:52:19.199
Please!

1254
01:52:20.867 --> 01:52:25.438
Stay where you are and don't move.

1255
01:52:42.555 --> 01:52:44.457
I don't know what this fuckin' shit means.

1256
01:52:44.491 --> 01:52:47.160
The box with the directions is right there.

1257
01:52:59.272 --> 01:53:01.107
"Easy to use.

1258
01:53:01.141 --> 01:53:05.912
Remove the cap and urinate on the absorbent end."

1259
01:53:05.945 --> 01:53:07.514
Blue means pregnant.

1260
01:53:07.947 --> 01:53:11.050
I'll read it myself, thank you.

1261
01:53:16.356 --> 01:53:21.094
Oh, okay. Say I were to believe you. What then?

1262
01:53:21.561 --> 01:53:23.830
Just go home.

1263
01:53:25.298 --> 01:53:27.400
I'll do the same.

1264
01:53:32.172 --> 01:53:34.474
(door opens)

1265
01:53:47.554 --> 01:53:49.222
Congratulations.

1266
01:53:53.059 --> 01:53:55.562
Before that strip turned blue,

1267
01:53:55.595 --> 01:53:59.299
I was a woman. I was your woman.

1268
01:53:59.332 --> 01:54:02.635
I was a killer who killed for you.

1269
01:54:02.669 --> 01:54:04.370
Before that strip turned blue,

1270
01:54:04.404 --> 01:54:08.374
I would've jumped a motorcycle onto a speeding train.

1271
01:54:09.342 --> 01:54:12.445
For you.

1272
01:54:12.478 --> 01:54:15.381
But once that strip turned blue,

1273
01:54:16.249 --> 01:54:19.085
I could no longer do any of those things.

1274
01:54:19.485 --> 01:54:22.055
Not anymore.

1275
01:54:22.088 --> 01:54:24.057
Because I was gonna be a mother.

1276
01:54:27.527 --> 01:54:29.229
Can you understand that?

1277
01:54:32.532 --> 01:54:34.267
Yes.

1278
01:54:35.235 --> 01:54:40.506
But why didn't you tell me then, instead of now?

1279
01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:43.243
Once you knew, you'd claim her.

1280
01:54:43.276 --> 01:54:45.111
And I didn't want that.

1281
01:54:45.745 --> 01:54:48.381
Not your decision to make.

1282
01:54:48.414 --> 01:54:50.416
Yes.

1283
01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:54.487
But it's the right decision, and I made it for my daughter.

1284
01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:59.359
She deserved to be born with a clean slate.

1285
01:54:59.392 --> 01:55:02.495
But with you she would've been born

1286
01:55:02.528 --> 01:55:04.931
into a world she shouldn't have.

1287
01:55:07.233 --> 01:55:10.236
I had to choose.

1288
01:55:10.270 --> 01:55:12.105
I chose her.

1289
01:55:15.041 --> 01:55:17.710
You know, five years ago,

1290
01:55:17.744 --> 01:55:20.713
if I had to make a list of impossible things

1291
01:55:20.747 --> 01:55:22.649
that could never happen,

1292
01:55:22.682 --> 01:55:24.984
you performing a coup de grace on me

1293
01:55:25.018 --> 01:55:28.354
by bustin' a cap in my crown...

1294
01:55:30.657 --> 01:55:32.725
would've been right at the top of the list.

1295
01:55:35.261 --> 01:55:37.130
I'd have been wrong, wouldn't I?

1296
01:55:38.431 --> 01:55:40.133
I'm sorry.

1297
01:55:40.166 --> 01:55:42.035
Was that a question?

1298
01:55:43.703 --> 01:55:46.439
Of impossible things that could never happen,

1299
01:55:46.472 --> 01:55:49.742
yes, in this instance, you would've been wrong.

1300
01:55:50.543 --> 01:55:51.744
Well?

1301
01:55:52.478 --> 01:55:55.515
When you never came back,

1302
01:55:55.548 --> 01:55:58.785
I naturally assumed Lisa Wong,

1303
01:55:58.818 --> 01:56:01.621
or somebody else, had killed you.

1304
01:56:01.654 --> 01:56:05.091
Oh! And for the record,

1305
01:56:05.124 --> 01:56:08.127
letting somebody think somebody they love is dead

1306
01:56:08.161 --> 01:56:11.431
when they're not is quite cruel.

1307
01:56:14.634 --> 01:56:19.539
I mourned you for three months.

1308
01:56:19.572 --> 01:56:23.710
And in the third month of mourning you

1309
01:56:23.743 --> 01:56:26.212
I tracked you down.

1310
01:56:26.245 --> 01:56:28.481
I wasn't tryin' to track you down.

1311
01:56:28.514 --> 01:56:30.683
I was tryin' to track down the fucking assholes

1312
01:56:30.717 --> 01:56:33.753
I thought killed you.

1313
01:56:33.786 --> 01:56:37.457
So I find you.

1314
01:56:37.490 --> 01:56:39.759
And what do I find?

1315
01:56:39.792 --> 01:56:43.329
Not only are you not dead,

1316
01:56:43.363 --> 01:56:47.667
you're getting married to some fucking jerk.

1317
01:56:49.569 --> 01:56:52.472
And you're pregnant.

1318
01:56:55.475 --> 01:56:57.710
I overreacted.

1319
01:57:06.486 --> 01:57:10.289
You overreacted? Is that your explanation?

1320
01:57:10.323 --> 01:57:12.725
I didn't say I was gonna explain myself.

1321
01:57:12.759 --> 01:57:15.361
I said I was gonna tell you the truth.

1322
01:57:15.795 --> 01:57:19.632
But if that's too cryptic, let's get literal.

1323
01:57:22.301 --> 01:57:24.804
I'm a killer.

1324
01:57:24.837 --> 01:57:28.508
I'm a murdering bastard. You know that.

1325
01:57:28.541 --> 01:57:31.344
And there are consequences

1326
01:57:31.377 --> 01:57:35.681
to breaking the heart of a murdering bastard.

1327
01:57:35.715 --> 01:57:38.584
You experienced some of them.

1328
01:57:41.721 --> 01:57:45.725
Was my reaction really that surprising?

1329
01:57:45.758 --> 01:57:49.429
Yes. It was.

1330
01:57:51.464 --> 01:57:55.301
Could you do what you did?

1331
01:57:55.334 --> 01:57:59.172
Of course you could.

1332
01:57:59.205 --> 01:58:03.342
But I never thought you would, or could,

1333
01:58:03.376 --> 01:58:05.645
do that to me.

1334
01:58:05.678 --> 01:58:08.581
I'm really sorry, Kiddo,

1335
01:58:08.614 --> 01:58:10.817
but you thought wrong.

1336
01:58:17.256 --> 01:58:21.461
You and I have unfinished business.

1337
01:58:22.261 --> 01:58:25.431
Baby, you ain't kiddin'.

1338
01:58:32.772 --> 01:58:34.474

1339

(groans)

1340
01:58:46.652 --> 01:58:48.287
Aah.

1341
01:58:55.795 --> 01:59:00.233
Ha. Pai Mei taught you

1342
01:59:00.266 --> 01:59:04.303
the five-point-palm exploding-heart technique?

1343
01:59:06.973 --> 01:59:09.342
'Course he did.

1344
01:59:11.244 --> 01:59:13.312
Why didn't you tell me?

1345
01:59:16.949 --> 01:59:19.485
I don't know.

1346
01:59:21.621 --> 01:59:24.724
Because I'm...

1347
01:59:24.757 --> 01:59:27.627
a bad person.

1348
01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:29.295
BILL: No.

1349
01:59:31.330 --> 01:59:34.433
You're not a bad person.

1350
01:59:34.467 --> 01:59:37.503
You're a terrific person.

1351
01:59:37.537 --> 01:59:40.306
You're my favorite person.

1352
01:59:42.341 --> 01:59:45.845
But every once in a while

1353
01:59:45.878 --> 01:59:47.847
you can be a real cunt.

1354
02:00:07.567 --> 02:00:09.368
How do I look?

1355
02:00:24.984 --> 02:00:26.819
You look ready.

1356
02:02:13.993 --> 02:02:19.131
Well, well, well. If it ain't the little flower.

1358
02:02:25.137 --> 02:02:28.908
and all the ships at sea. Let's go to press. Flash.

1359
02:02:28.941 --> 02:02:31.777
Do you have a magpie in your home?

1360
02:02:31.811 --> 02:02:34.046
If you do, you are most fortunate.

1361
02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:37.750
The magpie is the most charming bird in all the world.

1362
02:02:37.783 --> 02:02:40.152
He is the best friend a farmer ever had.

1363
02:02:40.186 --> 02:02:43.522
Treat him gently. Treat him kindly.

1364
02:02:43.556 --> 02:02:45.591
And always remember,

1365
02:02:45.624 --> 02:02:47.993
the magpie deserves your respect.

(laughing)

1368
02:03:23.963 --> 02:03:26.565
Thank you.

1369
02:03:26.599 --> 02:03:30.736
Thank you. Thank you.

1370
02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:33.105
Oh, thank you.

1372
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:39.945
I ain't got no headache.

1373
02:03:39.979 --> 02:03:43.482
Oh, yes, you have, brother.
