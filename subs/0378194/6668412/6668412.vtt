1
00:47:12.704 --> 00:47:13.830
Master...

2
00:47:15.665 --> 00:47:17.375
Your Mandarin is lousy.

3
00:47:18.335 --> 00:47:19.669
It causes my ears discomfort.

4
00:47:19.753 --> 00:47:21.379
You bray like an ass!

5
00:47:22.172 --> 00:47:24.299
You are not to speak unless spoken to.

6
00:47:25.216 --> 00:47:28.761
Is it too much to hope --
you understand Cantonese?

7
00:47:32.557 --> 00:47:33.933
I speak Japanese very well--

8
00:47:34.017 --> 00:47:37.311
I didn't ask if you speak Japanese --

9
00:47:37.395 --> 00:47:39.522
I asked if you understand Cantonese?

10
00:47:42.734 --> 00:47:47.234
You are here to learn the mysteries
of Kung Fu, not linguistics.

11
00:47:47.739 --> 00:47:51.409
If you can't understand me -- I will
communicate with you like I would a dog.

12
00:47:51.743 --> 00:47:55.246
When I yell, when I point, when I beat you
with my stick!

13
00:48:01.294 --> 00:48:03.170
Bill is your master, is he not?

14
00:48:08.927 --> 00:48:12.722
Your master tells me --
you're not entirely unschooled.

15
00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.099
What training do you possess?

16
00:48:23.817 --> 00:48:26.820
The exquisite art of the Samurai sword.
Don't make me laugh!

17
00:48:26.903 --> 00:48:31.403
Your so-called exquisite art,
is only fit for --

18
00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:33.534
Japanese fat heads!

19
00:48:38.665 --> 00:48:43.165
Your anger amuses me. Do you believe
you are my match?

20
00:48:44.337 --> 00:48:44.962
No.

21
00:48:45.797 --> 00:48:47.757
Are you aware I kill at will?

22
00:48:48.425 --> 00:48:49.467
Yes.

23
00:48:49.968 --> 00:48:51.344
Is it your wish to die?

24
00:48:51.428 --> 00:48:52.303
No.

25
00:48:54.305 --> 00:48:55.222
Then you must be stupid...

26
00:48:55.306 --> 00:48:57.683
Then you must be stupid... so stupid.

27
00:48:57.767 --> 00:49:01.479
Rise, and let me look at your
ridiculous face.

28
00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:03.147
Rise.

29
00:49:07.694 --> 00:49:12.194
So my pathetic friend...
Is there anything that you can do well?

30
00:49:14.159 --> 00:49:16.119
What's the matter?

31
00:49:16.536 --> 00:49:18.496
Cat got your tongue?

32
00:49:19.956 --> 00:49:22.917
-- Oh yes, you speak Japanese.

33
00:49:23.543 --> 00:49:25.002
I despise the Goddamn Japs!

34
00:49:28.006 --> 00:49:29.757
Go to that rack.

35
00:49:38.057 --> 00:49:39.016
Remove the sword.

36
00:50:05.376 --> 00:50:07.169
Let's see how good you really are.

37
00:50:08.046 --> 00:50:09.672
If...

38
00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:12.050
...you land a single blow,

39
00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:15.511
I'll bow down and call you master.

40
00:50:29.734 --> 00:50:32.236
From here you can get an excellent
view of my foot.

41
00:50:37.408 --> 00:50:40.869
Your swordsmanship -- is amateur at best.

42
00:50:54.884 --> 00:50:59.384
Your so-called kung-fu -- is really --
quite pathetic.

43
00:51:03.059 --> 00:51:06.854
I asked you to demonstrate -- what you know
-- and you did...

44
00:51:07.564 --> 00:51:08.773
Not a goddamn thing!

45
00:51:09.816 --> 00:51:13.444
Let's see your Tiger Crane --
match my Eagle's Claw.

46
00:52:10.627 --> 00:52:12.587
Like all Yankee women...

47
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:16.173
...all you can do is order in restaurants
and spend a man's money.

48
00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.926
Excruciating -- isn't it?

49
00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:20.261
Yes!

50
00:52:21.846 --> 00:52:23.180
If it was my wish...

51
00:52:23.681 --> 00:52:24.973
...I could chop your arm off.

52
00:52:27.810 --> 00:52:30.103
It's my arm now. I can do what I please.

53
00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:32.815
If you can stop me -- I suggest you try.

54
00:52:35.193 --> 00:52:36.194
I can't.

55
00:52:37.362 --> 00:52:38.613
Because you're helpless?

56
00:52:39.489 --> 00:52:40.364
Yes.

57
00:52:43.034 --> 00:52:45.119
Have you ever felt this before?

58
00:52:45.536 --> 00:52:46.328
No.

59
00:52:46.579 --> 00:52:49.999
Compared to me -- you're as helpless
as a worm fighting an eagle?

60
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.209
YES!!!

61
00:52:54.379 --> 00:52:55.129
THAT'S THE BEGINNING!

62
00:53:00.885 --> 00:53:03.554
Is it your wish to possess this
kind of power?

63
00:53:09.394 --> 00:53:12.188
Your training will begin -- tomorrow.

64
00:53:20.947 --> 00:53:22.323
Since your arm now belongs to me...

65
00:53:23.241 --> 00:53:24.533
...I want it strong.

66
00:53:26.077 --> 00:53:27.495
Can you do that?

67
00:53:29.205 --> 00:53:30.873
I can, but not that close.

68
00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.332
Then you can't do it.

69
00:53:33.584 --> 00:53:37.337
What if your enemy -- is three inches
in front of you...

70
00:53:38.423 --> 00:53:39.674
...What do you do then...

71
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:41.926
...Curl into a ball...

72
00:53:43.594 --> 00:53:44.845
...or do you put your FIST through him?

73
00:53:46.431 --> 00:53:47.181
Now begin.

74
00:54:19.422 --> 00:54:23.467
It's the wood that should fear your hand --
-- not the other way around.

75
00:54:24.302 --> 00:54:28.802
No wonder you can't do it -- you acquiesce
to defeat -- before you even begin.

76
00:56:18.541 --> 00:56:20.751
If you want to eat like a dog...

77
00:56:22.044 --> 00:56:24.046
You can live and sleep outside like a dog.

78
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:28.425
If you want to live and sleep
like a human...

79
00:56:30.052 --> 00:56:31.553
...pick up those sticks.

80
01:18:23.281 --> 01:18:26.742
Elle, you treacherous dog.

81
01:18:31.331 --> 01:18:33.916
I - give - you - my - word --
