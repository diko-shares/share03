1
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:36.981
Game over.

2
00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:39.553
I'll fuckin' kill you!

3
00:00:39.654 --> 00:00:41.884
You fuckin' bitch!

4
00:00:42.924 --> 00:00:44.391
You bitch!

5
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.219
I'll fuckin' kill you!

6
00:02:17.018 --> 00:02:19.145
Daniel!

7
00:05:15.363 --> 00:05:18.799
Secure the flank!
Left side clear?

8
00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:20.332
We're clear!

9
00:05:20.434 --> 00:05:22.868
Left side's clear.
Let's move!

10
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.417
Oh, my God.

11
00:05:39.954 --> 00:05:41.478
Someone call Kerry.

12
00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:45.389
The call came in at 11:45.
The woman heard an explosion.

13
00:05:45.493 --> 00:05:46.824
The fire department was
the first on the scene.

14
00:05:46.927 --> 00:05:48.019
Kerry.

15
00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:50.359
- Is it him?
- Before you go in there--

16
00:05:50.464 --> 00:05:52.591
Eric. Is it him?

17
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.894
We don't know yet.

18
00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.105
It's not Detective Matthews.

19
00:06:17.858 --> 00:06:18.825
What happened?

20
00:06:18.926 --> 00:06:22.327
The victim was held
in place by these chains.

21
00:07:01.802 --> 00:07:04.862
Hello, Troy.

22
00:07:04.972 --> 00:07:07.497
I wanna play a game.

23
00:07:07.608 --> 00:07:09.872
This game will take place
in a room not much bigger

24
00:07:09.977 --> 00:07:12.707
than the room you've
spent most of your life in.

25
00:07:12.813 --> 00:07:14.440
A prison cell.

26
00:07:14.548 --> 00:07:16.982
Despite all of the advantages
and privileges

27
00:07:17.084 --> 00:07:18.711
that you were given at birth,

28
00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:23.017
you have returned
to prison again and again.

29
00:07:23.124 --> 00:07:26.423
More comfortable in chains
than you are in freedom.

30
00:07:26.527 --> 00:07:30.054
Tonight we will see how
far you are willing to go

31
00:07:30.164 --> 00:07:32.689
to break those chains
once and for all.

32
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.290
Live or die, Troy.

33
00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:36.528
Make your choice.

34
00:07:55.523 --> 00:07:57.923
This was the bomb.

35
00:07:58.025 --> 00:08:03.588
All he had to do was release himself
from each of the chains...

36
00:08:03.697 --> 00:08:07.656
walk out the door before it went off.

37
00:08:09.703 --> 00:08:11.330
All he had to do?

38
00:08:55.883 --> 00:08:57.714
Oh, God.

39
00:09:33.854 --> 00:09:36.220
Fuck! Fuck!

40
00:09:53.474 --> 00:09:55.874
I really had this feeling
it was going to be him.

41
00:09:55.976 --> 00:10:01.380
Kerry, Eric is a missing persons case,
not a homicide case.

42
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.109
I've been having nightmares
where I see him.

43
00:10:11.992 --> 00:10:14.893
I'm never going to be able
to forgive myself for what happened.

44
00:10:14.995 --> 00:10:17.395
Listen.
It's not your fault.

45
00:10:17.498 --> 00:10:18.795
It's always somebody's fault.

46
00:10:18.899 --> 00:10:20.366
That somebody isn't you.

47
00:10:20.467 --> 00:10:22.731
That someone is still out there.

48
00:10:22.836 --> 00:10:26.738
Put all your anger into finding them
and putting them away.

49
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.137
All right?

50
00:10:29.009 --> 00:10:31.910
What I don't understand is

51
00:10:32.012 --> 00:10:33.570
how the hell could Jigsaw
do all of this?

52
00:10:33.681 --> 00:10:36.309
He was damn near on his deathbed
the last time we saw him.

53
00:10:39.186 --> 00:10:40.448
I'm not so sure he did.

54
00:10:40.554 --> 00:10:42.818
So far this doesn't follow
any of his patterns.

55
00:10:42.923 --> 00:10:44.254
Meaning?

56
00:10:44.358 --> 00:10:47.020
Well... how'd you get in here?

57
00:10:47.127 --> 00:10:49.391
- We cut the door down.
- Why?

58
00:10:49.496 --> 00:10:52.556
Because somebody heard
an explosion and called us.

59
00:10:52.666 --> 00:10:54.964
I mean, why did you
have to cut the door down?

60
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:56.798
It was welded shut.

61
00:10:56.904 --> 00:10:58.269
Bloody truck couldn't get in here.

62
00:10:58.372 --> 00:10:59.634
Exactly.

63
00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.708
I don't follow.

64
00:11:01.809 --> 00:11:04.175
If the aim of Jigsaw's game was
to get out before the bomb went off,

65
00:11:04.278 --> 00:11:06.041
then why was the door
welded shut?

66
00:11:06.146 --> 00:11:08.444
The guy couldn't get out if he wanted to.

67
00:11:08.549 --> 00:11:11.746
You won't believe this.
We got the tape out clean.

68
00:12:04.104 --> 00:12:07.301
Hello, Troy.
I wanna play a game.

69
00:12:09.576 --> 00:12:13.068
Live or die, Troy.
Make your choice.

70
00:14:12.232 --> 00:14:13.256
Hello, Kerry.

71
00:14:14.735 --> 00:14:16.225
I want to play a game.

72
00:14:16.336 --> 00:14:20.602
Up until now you have spent
your life among the dead

73
00:14:20.707 --> 00:14:22.299
piecing together
their final moments.

74
00:14:22.409 --> 00:14:25.708
You are good at this because you,
like them,

75
00:14:25.812 --> 00:14:27.109
are also dead.

76
00:14:27.214 --> 00:14:29.876
Dead on the inside.

77
00:14:29.983 --> 00:14:34.147
You identify more
with a cold corpse

78
00:14:34.254 --> 00:14:36.154
than you do
with a living human.

79
00:14:36.256 --> 00:14:39.384
I believe you want
to join your true family,

80
00:14:39.493 --> 00:14:42.587
indeed, your only family,
in death.

81
00:14:44.031 --> 00:14:45.658
The device you are wearing

82
00:14:45.766 --> 00:14:48.360
is hooked into your ribcage.

83
00:14:48.468 --> 00:14:50.527
And by the time
this tape is finished,

84
00:14:50.637 --> 00:14:53.834
you will have one minute
to find a way out.

85
00:14:53.941 --> 00:14:57.308
At the end of that minute,
you should know

86
00:14:57.411 --> 00:15:00.505
better than anyone
what happens then.

87
00:15:00.614 --> 00:15:03.708
There is a simple key
that will unlock the harness, Kerry.

88
00:15:03.817 --> 00:15:05.375
It is right in front of you.

89
00:15:05.485 --> 00:15:09.251
All you have to do is
reach in and take it.

90
00:15:10.457 --> 00:15:11.947
But do it quickly.

91
00:15:12.059 --> 00:15:17.087
The acid will dissolve the key
in a matter of seconds.

92
00:15:17.197 --> 00:15:19.563
Make your choice.

93
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.686
You.

94
00:17:34.101 --> 00:17:36.262
I gotta be at the hospital by 9.

95
00:17:38.905 --> 00:17:41.373
It's Tuesday.
I thought you started at 11.

96
00:17:41.475 --> 00:17:45.309
Yeah, well, they change
things on me last minute.

97
00:17:45.412 --> 00:17:46.902
Well, you better head off, then.

98
00:17:54.654 --> 00:17:55.814
You're not gonna take a shower?

99
00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:01.624
Nah. I'm just gonna take
a shower at the hospital.

100
00:18:01.728 --> 00:18:06.461
Can we just...
talk for five minutes?

101
00:18:06.566 --> 00:18:10.434
How about we just make eye contact
for five seconds?

102
00:18:10.537 --> 00:18:11.629
What's wrong?

103
00:18:11.738 --> 00:18:16.903
Nothing.
Just... everything.

104
00:18:19.579 --> 00:18:21.137
Lynn.

105
00:18:21.248 --> 00:18:22.977
What is it you want from me, Chris?

106
00:18:24.951 --> 00:18:25.940
A divorce.

107
00:18:35.295 --> 00:18:36.284
MPA.

108
00:18:37.731 --> 00:18:39.426
Car skidded into oncoming traffic.

109
00:18:41.001 --> 00:18:41.899
Pressure?

110
00:18:42.002 --> 00:18:43.196
80 over, palp.
Pulse is thready.

111
00:18:43.303 --> 00:18:45.134
Ready? 1, 2, 3.

112
00:18:45.238 --> 00:18:47.968
- Where's Lynn?
- Page Dr. Denlon.

113
00:18:48.074 --> 00:18:48.972
Set up an art-line.

114
00:18:49.075 --> 00:18:50.042
Dr. Lynn Denlon,

115
00:18:50.143 --> 00:18:51.474
please report
to trauma immediately.

116
00:18:52.012 --> 00:18:54.446
Dr. Lynn Denlon, please
report to trauma immediately.

117
00:18:56.349 --> 00:18:57.316
Lynn!

118
00:18:59.286 --> 00:19:01.083
Check this out.
Hermaphony.

119
00:19:01.188 --> 00:19:04.248
Pressure down to 70.
He's going into shock.

120
00:19:04.357 --> 00:19:06.348
Get an OR ready.
We gotta crack his chest.

121
00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.052
Do we get a bolus?
500 wide open?

122
00:19:08.161 --> 00:19:09.128
No.

123
00:19:10.797 --> 00:19:12.389
What?

124
00:19:16.069 --> 00:19:17.696
- No air entry on the right side.
- And?

125
00:19:17.804 --> 00:19:19.669
Let's get a chest tube in him.

126
00:19:19.773 --> 00:19:22.708
We gotta get him to OR now.

127
00:19:22.809 --> 00:19:24.709
His stats are dropping.
He's gonna code.

128
00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.247
I'm doin' it.

129
00:19:38.725 --> 00:19:40.283
I'm getting a rush of air.

130
00:19:40.393 --> 00:19:43.419
Stats are improving.
Pressure back to 80.

131
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:45.998
Pressure normal.

132
00:20:02.849 --> 00:20:04.680
If you got something on your mind,
go upstairs to psych.

133
00:20:04.784 --> 00:20:06.411
Just don't bring it in here.

134
00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.147
We don't have any seconds to spare, Lynn.

135
00:20:08.255 --> 00:20:10.849
The woman standing in front of me
had to be dragged

136
00:20:10.957 --> 00:20:13.790
from the locker room
to put a chest tube in a trauma patient?

137
00:20:13.894 --> 00:20:15.828
Lynn Denlon should have been
the first one there.

138
00:20:19.633 --> 00:20:20.600
Lynn.

139
00:20:21.635 --> 00:20:22.602
Lynn!

140
00:20:56.636 --> 00:20:57.933
What the hell?

141
00:20:58.471 --> 00:20:59.768
I'm locked in!

142
00:20:59.873 --> 00:21:01.864
Is anybody there?

143
00:21:01.975 --> 00:21:03.203
Hello?

144
00:21:11.318 --> 00:21:12.945
Anybody here?

145
00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:40.201
Help! Help me!

146
00:22:42.742 --> 00:22:44.642
Help!

147
00:22:49.849 --> 00:22:52.044
Who are you?
Who are you?

148
00:22:52.152 --> 00:22:53.949
What is this?

149
00:22:56.256 --> 00:22:59.987
What are you doing?

150
00:23:04.798 --> 00:23:06.060
Are you gonna behave?

151
00:23:13.907 --> 00:23:15.272
Let's go.

152
00:23:17.377 --> 00:23:20.005
What is this place?
What is this place?

153
00:23:29.122 --> 00:23:31.818
What is... this place?

154
00:23:38.898 --> 00:23:41.560
Who are you?
Who are you?

155
00:23:46.539 --> 00:23:48.097
Hello, Dr. Denlon.

156
00:23:48.208 --> 00:23:52.941
You may not remember me,
but I most certainly remember you.

157
00:23:53.046 --> 00:23:58.609
I was a guest at your hospital once.

158
00:24:01.821 --> 00:24:02.788
Where am I?

159
00:24:06.059 --> 00:24:07.959
Do you remember me?

160
00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:18.767
I've seen you on television.

161
00:24:20.607 --> 00:24:23.041
Lawrence Gordon was your doctor.

162
00:24:23.143 --> 00:24:26.635
I was his patient,
and he was mine.

163
00:24:28.148 --> 00:24:29.911
As you can see from that report,

164
00:24:30.016 --> 00:24:31.881
my prognosis isn't good.

165
00:24:33.586 --> 00:24:35.645
Would you agree?

166
00:24:42.562 --> 00:24:44.962
There's no preventative treatment
for what you have.

167
00:24:45.064 --> 00:24:48.033
I remember you saying that
to me once before

168
00:24:48.134 --> 00:24:50.694
in almost the exact same tone.

169
00:24:50.804 --> 00:24:54.467
Leave it to a doctor to find such a cold,
clinical way

170
00:24:54.574 --> 00:24:57.668
of saying I'm a dead man walking.

171
00:24:57.777 --> 00:25:00.439
Looking at me,
how long would you say I have left?

172
00:25:00.547 --> 00:25:03.675
I'd have to examine you.

173
00:25:03.783 --> 00:25:06.650
Even then,
a frontal lobe tumor is unpredictable.

174
00:25:06.753 --> 00:25:10.154
The growth depends on the rate of mitosis
versus apoptosis--

175
00:25:10.256 --> 00:25:14.693
I'm sorry, but there's all this crude
medical equipment around me

176
00:25:14.794 --> 00:25:18.252
causing you to believe
that you're still inside a hospital.

177
00:25:18.364 --> 00:25:19.661
No.

178
00:25:19.766 --> 00:25:21.233
Then why are you speaking to me

179
00:25:21.334 --> 00:25:24.394
in that graduate school
medical jargon?

180
00:25:26.973 --> 00:25:27.871
Look at me!

181
00:25:30.443 --> 00:25:32.274
Now, you look at me.

182
00:25:32.378 --> 00:25:34.903
I asked you a simple question.

183
00:25:35.014 --> 00:25:36.743
Based on your experience,

184
00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:40.377
how long do you think I have left?

185
00:25:40.486 --> 00:25:42.613
It's not a simple answer.

186
00:25:42.722 --> 00:25:47.682
Based on your file,
I'd say... not long.

187
00:25:56.302 --> 00:25:58.497
Death is a surprise party.

188
00:25:58.605 --> 00:26:04.339
Unless, of course,
you're already dead on the inside.

189
00:26:07.614 --> 00:26:09.104
Unless you're the type of person

190
00:26:09.215 --> 00:26:13.083
who swallows antidepressants
to hide the pain, huh?

191
00:26:13.186 --> 00:26:15.347
Turns their back on their husband.

192
00:26:15.455 --> 00:26:17.514
Neglects their child.

193
00:26:17.624 --> 00:26:20.184
Who has every possible
advantage in life

194
00:26:20.293 --> 00:26:22.761
but chooses not to advance.

195
00:26:22.862 --> 00:26:24.762
What do you want from me?

196
00:26:26.332 --> 00:26:28.095
What do I want?

197
00:26:30.203 --> 00:26:31.602
I want to play a game.

198
00:26:35.074 --> 00:26:38.566
The rules of the game are simple.

199
00:26:38.678 --> 00:26:42.273
The consequences
for breaking them are great.

200
00:26:42.382 --> 00:26:43.349
Death.

201
00:26:45.952 --> 00:26:48.614
You're being tested.
Your will is being tested.

202
00:26:48.721 --> 00:26:50.655
Your will to keep someone alive.

203
00:26:50.757 --> 00:26:51.917
Can you do that?

204
00:26:52.025 --> 00:26:54.755
Can you follow the rules
and grant someone the gift of life?

205
00:26:54.861 --> 00:26:57.796
What is this?
No! Get it--

206
00:26:57.897 --> 00:27:03.426
No! No! What is this!
What are you doing to me?

207
00:27:09.208 --> 00:27:13.269
The device that you're wearing
is linked to my heart rate monitor.

208
00:27:13.379 --> 00:27:18.180
The second that heart rate monitor flatlines
or you move out of range,

209
00:27:18.284 --> 00:27:21.151
an explosion will go off in that collar.

210
00:27:21.254 --> 00:27:25.657
Your life and my life
will end simultaneously.

211
00:27:26.893 --> 00:27:28.952
Please.
Please don't do this to me.

212
00:27:29.062 --> 00:27:31.895
I have a family.
I have a family.

213
00:27:31.998 --> 00:27:34.364
Let me give you
the simple version.

214
00:27:35.902 --> 00:27:39.531
You will keep him alive,
whatever it takes.

215
00:27:39.639 --> 00:27:44.167
No excuses.
No equivocations.

216
00:27:44.277 --> 00:27:46.074
No crying.

217
00:27:46.179 --> 00:27:48.909
What do you mean,
keep him alive?

218
00:27:51.751 --> 00:27:56.552
Out there, on those screens,
we have another test subject.

219
00:27:56.656 --> 00:27:58.715
A man.

220
00:28:00.493 --> 00:28:04.657
He will face a series of tests.

221
00:28:04.764 --> 00:28:09.963
You have to keep John alive
until he makes it through.

222
00:28:11.004 --> 00:28:15.065
If he completes all of his tests
and John is still breathing,

223
00:28:15.174 --> 00:28:17.734
then I will remove your collar...

224
00:28:19.612 --> 00:28:21.273
and you're free to go.

225
00:28:22.548 --> 00:28:25.039
You're a vital piece
of my puzzle, Dr. Denlon.

226
00:28:25.151 --> 00:28:28.917
A critical part of what could be
my final test.

227
00:28:30.723 --> 00:28:34.523
Amanda,
it's time to start our game.

228
00:29:05.525 --> 00:29:06.856
Help!

229
00:29:13.332 --> 00:29:14.299
Hello!

230
00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:19.138
Is there anybody out there?

231
00:29:28.881 --> 00:29:31.145
Hello, Jeff.

232
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:32.877
Over the past few years,

233
00:29:32.985 --> 00:29:35.920
you have become a shell
of your former self...

234
00:29:36.022 --> 00:29:39.219
consumed with hatred
and vengeance.

235
00:29:39.325 --> 00:29:43.125
Vengeance against the drunk driver
who killed your only son.

236
00:29:43.229 --> 00:29:48.565
Vengeance against the killer,
who to your surprise and dismay,

237
00:29:48.668 --> 00:29:52.866
was set free after a hasty trial.

238
00:29:52.972 --> 00:29:57.272
Today, however,
it is you who will be put on trial.

239
00:29:57.376 --> 00:30:02.313
To escape from where you are,
you will have to face a series of tests.

240
00:30:02.415 --> 00:30:06.715
You will have to suffer
to move forward through each of them.

241
00:30:06.819 --> 00:30:11.085
But with each one,
you will also have a chance...

242
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:14.318
a chance to forgive.

243
00:30:14.427 --> 00:30:15.689
When you complete the tests,

244
00:30:15.795 --> 00:30:19.231
I promise you
you will finally come face to face

245
00:30:19.332 --> 00:30:22.233
with the man responsible
for the loss of your child.

246
00:30:22.335 --> 00:30:25.395
That will be your ultimate test.

247
00:30:25.505 --> 00:30:28.065
Can you forgive him?

248
00:30:29.609 --> 00:30:30.701
You better hurry, though.

249
00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:34.041
In two hours, the doors will lock,

250
00:30:34.147 --> 00:30:37.310
and this place
will become your tomb.

251
00:30:37.416 --> 00:30:40.943
This is what you've
been waiting for, Jeff.

252
00:30:41.053 --> 00:30:42.645
Let the game begin.

253
00:30:42.755 --> 00:30:44.655
Help!

254
00:31:11.317 --> 00:31:13.877
You fucking killed my son.

255
00:31:13.986 --> 00:31:16.716
Don't you fuckin' beg.

256
00:31:16.822 --> 00:31:20.952
Do you know who I am?

257
00:31:22.929 --> 00:31:25.056
I'll fuckin' teach you,
you motherfucker.

258
00:31:34.607 --> 00:31:36.734
This is what you fuckin' deserve.

259
00:31:57.797 --> 00:31:59.321
Where is it?

260
00:31:59.432 --> 00:32:01.059
What?

261
00:32:03.135 --> 00:32:04.329
Where is it?

262
00:32:11.844 --> 00:32:13.243
How many times?

263
00:32:14.747 --> 00:32:16.476
How many times
do I have to tell you

264
00:32:16.582 --> 00:32:18.015
before you get it in your head?

265
00:32:18.117 --> 00:32:20.915
I just wanted
to sleep with something.

266
00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:22.920
No. No. You just-- nothin'.

267
00:32:23.022 --> 00:32:27.982
You don't... touch things in Dylan's room.

268
00:32:31.797 --> 00:32:32.786
Okay?

269
00:33:23.716 --> 00:33:24.910
I'm sorry, Daddy.

270
00:33:33.993 --> 00:33:35.585
You know I love you, don't you?

271
00:33:39.365 --> 00:33:43.392
What do you think Mommy would say
if she saw us like this?

272
00:33:45.938 --> 00:33:48.907
I'm gonna go get ready for school.

273
00:34:11.897 --> 00:34:12.886
Daddy!

274
00:34:31.617 --> 00:34:33.244
Hello?

275
00:34:39.058 --> 00:34:40.923
Hello?

276
00:34:56.976 --> 00:34:58.773
Hey!

277
00:36:15.187 --> 00:36:17.382
All right, John.
I need you to look at my nose.

278
00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:18.548
Right here.

279
00:36:20.025 --> 00:36:22.186
Look at my nose, please?

280
00:36:22.294 --> 00:36:24.956
Follow my flashlight.

281
00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:34.130
Tell me if you feel any pain, all right?

282
00:36:35.241 --> 00:36:36.208
That hurt?

283
00:36:42.214 --> 00:36:43.738
It's begun.

284
00:36:45.417 --> 00:36:47.044
He's out of the box.

285
00:36:52.958 --> 00:36:53.947
So?

286
00:36:55.528 --> 00:36:57.962
My 20-second analysis
without any medical equipment

287
00:36:58.063 --> 00:36:59.428
is that his brain's herniating.

288
00:37:01.634 --> 00:37:04.967
He needs to go to the hospital
and have an operation

289
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:06.935
to decompress his brain.

290
00:37:07.039 --> 00:37:08.802
Come here.

291
00:37:08.908 --> 00:37:11.706
- No, really. Come here.
- What?

292
00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:12.868
- Come here.
- No.

293
00:37:12.978 --> 00:37:15.469
- Let me ask you something.
- Oh, God!

294
00:37:15.581 --> 00:37:18.277
Did I bring John to you...

295
00:37:18.384 --> 00:37:22.013
or did I bring your self-centered ass to him?

296
00:37:22.121 --> 00:37:25.887
You better start
fuckin' paying attention.

297
00:37:25.991 --> 00:37:28.960
No one's going to any hospital.

298
00:37:31.797 --> 00:37:33.230
I can't perform miracles.

299
00:37:33.332 --> 00:37:35.163
You're-- You're giving him painkillers.

300
00:37:35.267 --> 00:37:37.462
For a tumor like this,
he needs steroids, Prednisone.

301
00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:38.559
Oh, good. Yeah.

302
00:37:38.671 --> 00:37:40.468
Maybe we could try
some corticoid steroids,

303
00:37:40.573 --> 00:37:42.438
you know,
like Dexamethasone.

304
00:37:42.541 --> 00:37:44.873
Why don't you fuckin' tell me something
that I don't know,

305
00:37:44.977 --> 00:37:47.468
you stupid cunt?

306
00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:52.313
The only place that he can get
those drugs is in a hospital.

307
00:37:54.787 --> 00:37:56.118
Or else he's gonna die.

308
00:37:58.891 --> 00:38:01.826
You are not a good listener.

309
00:38:01.927 --> 00:38:05.419
I think you missed the part
that if he dies...

310
00:38:06.565 --> 00:38:08.123
you die.

311
00:38:08.233 --> 00:38:11.259
You're asking me
to do the impossible.

312
00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:14.669
I'm not asking you. He is.

313
00:38:14.773 --> 00:38:17.173
He chose you.

314
00:38:20.145 --> 00:38:21.908
- Not me.
- Amanda!

315
00:38:23.248 --> 00:38:26.649
Our doctor can't do
what's being asked of her

316
00:38:26.752 --> 00:38:28.811
if you're threatening her.

317
00:38:28.921 --> 00:38:32.721
The rules of our game
have been made very clear.

318
00:38:32.825 --> 00:38:35.988
You need to abide by those rules.

319
00:38:36.095 --> 00:38:37.062
Sorry.

320
00:38:56.849 --> 00:39:00.012
Amanda!
Amanda, I need your help!

321
00:39:00.119 --> 00:39:02.644
Amanda, he needs oxygen!

322
00:39:02.755 --> 00:39:04.848
Oxygen, Amanda!

323
00:39:04.957 --> 00:39:06.390
Put the mask on his face.

324
00:39:10.996 --> 00:39:12.327
Okay, now hold him down.

325
00:39:13.499 --> 00:39:15.899
Tip his head to the side.
You got it?

326
00:39:33.018 --> 00:39:34.280
What are you doing?

327
00:39:34.386 --> 00:39:37.150
Ativan!
Do you have Ativan?

328
00:39:37.256 --> 00:39:38.484
No!

329
00:39:40.359 --> 00:39:41.326
Back off! Back off!

330
00:39:41.427 --> 00:39:43.054
Back off! Back off!

331
00:39:45.531 --> 00:39:46.896
Stay with me, John.

332
00:39:46.999 --> 00:39:48.933
You're almost through this.
Stay with me.

333
00:39:53.806 --> 00:39:56.138
Stay with me.
We're almost done with this.

334
00:40:20.933 --> 00:40:22.628
Was that enough for you?

335
00:40:22.735 --> 00:40:24.532
Are you ready to go
to the hospital now?

336
00:40:26.839 --> 00:40:31.276
He needs to have an operation.

337
00:40:31.376 --> 00:40:33.970
- Okay.
- Okay.

338
00:40:34.079 --> 00:40:36.274
But we do it here.

339
00:40:36.381 --> 00:40:38.008
- We do it here.
- What?

340
00:40:38.117 --> 00:40:40.108
What do you need?

341
00:40:40.219 --> 00:40:42.710
I need anesthetic
for a procedure like this.

342
00:40:42.821 --> 00:40:43.845
Anesthetic.
What else?

343
00:40:43.956 --> 00:40:45.446
Even with an anesthetic--

344
00:40:45.557 --> 00:40:47.218
Anesthetic!
What else?

345
00:40:50.295 --> 00:40:51.762
A power drill.

346
00:42:39.538 --> 00:42:42.166
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

347
00:42:44.109 --> 00:42:48.478
Please, please.
Let me go.

348
00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:53.210
Please. Why... Why are you
doing this to me?

349
00:42:53.318 --> 00:42:56.947
Don't... Don't kill me.
Okay? Please!

350
00:42:57.055 --> 00:42:58.579
Wait. The key. Key.

351
00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:01.420
Key. Okay.
Come on.

352
00:43:01.526 --> 00:43:02.618
Fuck!

353
00:43:03.662 --> 00:43:05.391
Fuck!

354
00:43:06.832 --> 00:43:11.531
Please. I'm so cold.
I can't feel my arms.

355
00:43:19.211 --> 00:43:21.475
Welcome to your first test, Jeff.

356
00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:24.777
For the past three years,
you've cursed the name

357
00:43:24.883 --> 00:43:26.851
of all those you thought
were responsible

358
00:43:26.952 --> 00:43:29.352
for the death of your son.

359
00:43:29.454 --> 00:43:33.584
You fantasize those accountable will pay.

360
00:43:33.692 --> 00:43:37.560
Well, you will find a woman in front of you
chained in place.

361
00:43:37.663 --> 00:43:39.756
This will prevent her from running...

362
00:43:39.865 --> 00:43:43.096
much like she did
on the day your son was hit.

363
00:43:47.139 --> 00:43:49.266
Her name is Danica Scott.

364
00:43:49.374 --> 00:43:50.932
She was the only witness present

365
00:43:51.043 --> 00:43:53.807
at the scene
of your son's untimely demise.

366
00:44:00.452 --> 00:44:04.252
If not for her own self-absorption
and cowardice,

367
00:44:04.356 --> 00:44:08.759
she could have brought
your son's killer to justice.

368
00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:13.263
Now it is you who has a chance
to bring her to justice.

369
00:44:14.166 --> 00:44:19.570
You alone can grant her the gift of life
before she freezes to death.

370
00:44:19.671 --> 00:44:22.105
Behind the pipes
on the back wall

371
00:44:22.207 --> 00:44:24.971
you will find the key that
will free her and bring you

372
00:44:25.077 --> 00:44:26.476
one step closer to the man

373
00:44:26.578 --> 00:44:29.240
responsible for the loss
of your child.

374
00:44:30.182 --> 00:44:33.481
Will you claim the key
to save only yourself?

375
00:44:33.585 --> 00:44:35.212
Help me!

376
00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:38.983
Or can you find it within you
to save another?

377
00:44:39.391 --> 00:44:41.621
Make your choice.

378
00:45:10.422 --> 00:45:12.549
I didn't do anything.

379
00:45:14.126 --> 00:45:16.185
I didn't do anything to you!

380
00:45:16.294 --> 00:45:18.922
That's exactly it.
You didn't do anything.

381
00:45:20.999 --> 00:45:24.127
I'm fucking... dying.

382
00:45:24.236 --> 00:45:25.567
He died!

383
00:45:27.239 --> 00:45:28.331
In my arms.

384
00:45:29.474 --> 00:45:33.467
My eight-year-old son
died in my arms.

385
00:46:00.972 --> 00:46:04.567
I made a m-m-mistake.

386
00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:07.373
I'm so sorry.

387
00:46:07.479 --> 00:46:09.344
I'm human.

388
00:46:09.448 --> 00:46:12.906
I'm human,
just like your son was. Okay?

389
00:46:16.188 --> 00:46:17.155
Look at me.

390
00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:20.954
I said, look at me.
Look...

391
00:46:24.129 --> 00:46:25.756
Oh, my God.

392
00:46:25.864 --> 00:46:26.956
Oh, my God.

393
00:46:27.065 --> 00:46:29.226
It's so cold.

394
00:47:46.378 --> 00:47:48.437
Oh, God!

395
00:49:49.401 --> 00:49:53.303
Amanda, if you really care about John,

396
00:49:53.405 --> 00:49:55.270
you won't let me do this to him.

397
00:49:55.373 --> 00:49:56.601
You're a smart woman,

398
00:49:56.708 --> 00:49:57.936
and you know what's right for him.

399
00:49:58.043 --> 00:49:59.101
I'm sorry.

400
00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:00.939
I know it's hard to concentrate

401
00:50:01.046 --> 00:50:03.776
when you're surrounded by so many things
you could kill me with,

402
00:50:03.882 --> 00:50:06.316
like this ax I saw you lookin' at.

403
00:50:08.219 --> 00:50:09.277
Take it.

404
00:50:09.387 --> 00:50:11.150
Please, it's yours.

405
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:13.179
Come on.

406
00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:16.286
I'd go for the neck,

407
00:50:16.394 --> 00:50:18.555
but I'm not the brain surgeon.

408
00:50:18.663 --> 00:50:21.131
Just do it quietly
so John doesn't hear me die.

409
00:50:21.232 --> 00:50:22.699
Otherwise he's likely
to get upset,

410
00:50:22.801 --> 00:50:24.393
rip off his heart rate monitor.

411
00:50:24.502 --> 00:50:25.332
Boom.

412
00:50:25.437 --> 00:50:28.406
Then you just have to
find the sensor and disarm it

413
00:50:28.506 --> 00:50:30.906
so you can walk more
than 30 feet out that door

414
00:50:31.009 --> 00:50:33.000
without the collar detonating.

415
00:50:33.111 --> 00:50:36.569
Or you could try and take
the collar off yourself.

416
00:50:36.681 --> 00:50:37.943
But that could be tricky.

417
00:50:38.049 --> 00:50:41.485
The slightest knock
in the wrong place could trigger it.

418
00:50:41.586 --> 00:50:42.575
I should know.

419
00:50:46.191 --> 00:50:47.158
I built it.

420
00:50:50.995 --> 00:50:55.295
So, do you have
everything you need?

421
00:50:56.701 --> 00:50:58.862
I have the instruments
to cut someone open.

422
00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:02.770
I don't have the tools
to save a life.

423
00:51:02.874 --> 00:51:05.672
You'd be surprised
what tools can save a life.

424
00:51:52.724 --> 00:51:54.715
Hello, Amanda.

425
00:51:54.826 --> 00:51:58.387
You don't know me, but...
I know you.

426
00:52:00.265 --> 00:52:01.664
I want to play a game.

427
00:52:04.135 --> 00:52:07.070
There is only one key
to open the device.

428
00:52:11.242 --> 00:52:13.540
It's in the stomach
of your dead cellmate.

429
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:20.076
Look around, Amanda.

430
00:52:20.185 --> 00:52:23.518
Know that I'm not playing.

431
00:52:23.621 --> 00:52:25.555
Live or die.

432
00:52:25.657 --> 00:52:27.522
Make your choice.

433
00:52:33.731 --> 00:52:35.323
Congratulations.

434
00:52:35.433 --> 00:52:37.230
You are still alive.

435
00:52:38.136 --> 00:52:42.470
Most people are so ungrateful
to be alive,

436
00:52:42.574 --> 00:52:46.271
but not you, not anymore.

437
00:52:46.377 --> 00:52:50.643
Amanda, do not be afraid.

438
00:52:50.748 --> 00:52:52.875
Your life has just begun.

439
00:53:10.802 --> 00:53:13.270
He made it through
the freezer room.

440
00:53:16.608 --> 00:53:18.235
He tried to save her.

441
00:53:29.621 --> 00:53:37.153
There are some things
I need you to do for me.

442
00:53:37.262 --> 00:53:42.199
In my desk...
in the center drawer,

443
00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:44.200
an envelope...

444
00:53:44.302 --> 00:53:46.429
with your name on it.

445
00:53:50.308 --> 00:53:53.709
She's gonna do a procedure on you.

446
00:53:53.811 --> 00:53:55.210
Yeah.

447
00:53:55.313 --> 00:53:56.780
To relieve the pressure
on your brain.

448
00:53:56.881 --> 00:53:57.779
Yeah.

449
00:53:57.882 --> 00:53:59.782
And help with the headaches.

450
00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:10.218
I can't do this.

451
00:54:10.328 --> 00:54:12.558
Amanda... you can.

452
00:54:12.664 --> 00:54:14.598
You can.

453
00:54:14.699 --> 00:54:16.291
You're stronger now.

454
00:54:18.469 --> 00:54:20.994
And I believe in you.

455
00:54:26.177 --> 00:54:28.737
You chose her 'cause
she's the best, right?

456
00:54:30.848 --> 00:54:32.975
That's one reason I chose her.

457
00:56:23.127 --> 00:56:25.254
Damn it!

458
00:56:25.363 --> 00:56:27.422
Hello?

459
00:56:27.532 --> 00:56:29.659
Help me, please!

460
00:56:33.404 --> 00:56:35.167
Please, help me!

461
00:56:38.076 --> 00:56:40.044
I'm in here!

462
00:56:42.914 --> 00:56:44.711
Please get me out of here.

463
00:56:45.783 --> 00:56:47.751
Help me. I--

464
00:56:51.889 --> 00:56:53.481
Hello?

465
00:56:54.859 --> 00:56:55.883
I know you're there.

466
00:56:55.993 --> 00:56:58.723
Please!
Please help me!

467
00:57:02.567 --> 00:57:06.094
I-- I can hear you.
Please, answer me!

468
00:57:06.204 --> 00:57:07.967
Help me!

469
00:57:10.408 --> 00:57:11.670
Please!

470
00:57:12.376 --> 00:57:14.105
Help me.

471
00:57:16.981 --> 00:57:18.972
Get me out of here, please.

472
00:57:19.083 --> 00:57:20.050
Please help me.

473
00:57:20.151 --> 00:57:21.618
Get me out of here!

474
00:57:21.719 --> 00:57:22.708
Please!

475
00:57:24.088 --> 00:57:25.180
Don't just stand there!

476
00:57:25.289 --> 00:57:26.688
Help me!

477
00:57:30.895 --> 00:57:34.353
Jeff, when the judge
presiding over your case

478
00:57:34.465 --> 00:57:37.866
sentenced your boy's
murderer so lightly,

479
00:57:37.969 --> 00:57:39.937
your soul never recovered.

480
00:57:40.037 --> 00:57:44.440
Now you have the power to sentence
his soul straight to Hell.

481
00:57:44.542 --> 00:57:46.703
Or you can forgive.

482
00:57:46.811 --> 00:57:51.714
The key that will free him
is hidden inside your son's possessions--

483
00:57:51.816 --> 00:57:55.183
Possessions you have clung to
for far too long.

484
00:57:55.286 --> 00:57:59.882
Now, if you flip the switch
on the incinerator underneath you,

485
00:57:59.991 --> 00:58:02.357
a fire will cleanse you
of this obsession

486
00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:04.052
and destroy them all,

487
00:58:04.162 --> 00:58:06.722
leaving only the key remaining.

488
00:58:06.831 --> 00:58:08.765
It is also the key
that will bring you closer

489
00:58:08.866 --> 00:58:12.393
to the man accountable
for taking your child.

490
00:58:12.503 --> 00:58:14.733
He doesn't have much time, Jeff.

491
00:58:14.839 --> 00:58:15.771
Let the game begin.

492
00:58:15.873 --> 00:58:16.771
Please, get me out of here.

493
00:58:16.874 --> 00:58:18.432
Please!

494
00:58:22.346 --> 00:58:23.973
What is that?

495
00:58:30.188 --> 00:58:31.314
What's that sound?

496
00:59:10.561 --> 00:59:13.462
I'm a criminal court judge,
for Christ's sake!

497
00:59:13.564 --> 00:59:14.690
You can't do this to me!

498
00:59:17.235 --> 00:59:18.395
You don't remember me?

499
00:59:22.907 --> 00:59:25.375
Well, maybe you remember
Timothy Young?

500
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:35.783
He was the driver
who killed my son.

501
00:59:35.887 --> 00:59:38.014
You gave him six months!

502
00:59:38.723 --> 00:59:40.520
Okay. All right.

503
00:59:40.625 --> 00:59:41.853
We can talk about your case.

504
00:59:41.959 --> 00:59:44.189
Obviously you want answers.

505
00:59:44.295 --> 00:59:46.388
I can't give them to you like this.

506
00:59:47.398 --> 00:59:48.558
This hurts!

507
00:59:50.167 --> 00:59:52.362
You gave more for
fuckin' parking tickets!

508
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:53.630
Listen to me.

509
00:59:53.738 --> 00:59:57.037
I can see that you're
in a great deal of pain,

510
00:59:57.141 --> 01:00:00.338
but there are ways that we can have
his sentence extended.

511
01:00:00.444 --> 01:00:01.638
I can help you!

512
01:00:01.746 --> 01:00:03.941
It's too late!

513
01:00:04.048 --> 01:00:06.016
They let him go!

514
01:00:06.117 --> 01:00:07.880
Don't become what he is!

515
01:00:09.453 --> 01:00:11.353
Don't become a killer!

516
01:00:11.455 --> 01:00:14.583
Please!
I have a son, too.

517
01:00:23.567 --> 01:00:24.829
Where are you going?

518
01:00:26.837 --> 01:00:29.362
You gotta help me!

519
01:00:33.978 --> 01:00:35.536
I'm so sorry!

520
01:00:40.518 --> 01:00:41.883
Oh, God.

521
01:00:43.321 --> 01:00:44.948
You're killing me!

522
01:00:46.824 --> 01:00:50.123
Don't do this to me!
I'm gonna die!

523
01:00:56.834 --> 01:00:57.630
Fuck you!

524
01:00:59.136 --> 01:01:00.763
Fuck you, you--

525
01:01:01.272 --> 01:01:02.432
You gotta help me!

526
01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:03.973
Shut the fuck up.

527
01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:27.557
Help!

528
01:02:44.642 --> 01:02:45.700
Come on!

529
01:03:38.295 --> 01:03:41.753
He made it through
the second test.

530
01:03:41.866 --> 01:03:45.131
The judge is alive.

531
01:03:45.236 --> 01:03:46.794
Faster than I expected.

532
01:03:46.904 --> 01:03:49.930
All right, John, I need you
to keep your head to the side

533
01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.031
and keep still.

534
01:03:52.143 --> 01:03:53.974
What's goin' on here
is that your brain

535
01:03:54.078 --> 01:03:55.705
is pushing
against your skull.

536
01:03:55.813 --> 01:03:58.646
I'm gonna try
to relieve the pressure

537
01:03:58.749 --> 01:04:00.376
by cutting away
a little bit of your skull.

538
01:04:00.484 --> 01:04:03.044
It should help you
with your headaches

539
01:04:03.154 --> 01:04:05.645
and drastically improve
your motor skills.

540
01:04:05.756 --> 01:04:06.882
Do you understand?

541
01:04:06.991 --> 01:04:10.256
All too well.

542
01:04:18.602 --> 01:04:22.504
All right, you're gonna feel
some slight discomfort.

543
01:04:22.606 --> 01:04:24.767
Are you gonna give him
a general anesthetic?

544
01:04:24.875 --> 01:04:26.365
For a procedure like this,

545
01:04:26.477 --> 01:04:28.445
the patient needs to be
fully alert.

546
01:04:36.654 --> 01:04:37.985
Okay.

547
01:05:18.028 --> 01:05:19.655
Amanda, I need you here.

548
01:05:21.398 --> 01:05:22.387
Amanda.

549
01:05:24.535 --> 01:05:29.302
All right, John,
you're gonna feel some pressure.

550
01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:42.448
Let's clamp this.
Stop the bleeding.

551
01:05:55.499 --> 01:05:57.660
Fill that syringe
with alcohol from that bowl.

552
01:06:03.107 --> 01:06:04.301
Hurry.

553
01:06:13.417 --> 01:06:16.011
All right, John,
I need you to keep your mouth closed.

554
01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.917
You're gonna hear
a lot of noise.

555
01:07:17.014 --> 01:07:18.072
John, how you doin'?

556
01:07:18.182 --> 01:07:20.082
Never better.

557
01:07:22.219 --> 01:07:23.186
All right.

558
01:07:33.797 --> 01:07:36.857
All right,
you're gonna hear a lot of ringing.

559
01:07:36.967 --> 01:07:39.367
I need you to stay very still.

560
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:41.438
Here I go.

561
01:08:25.182 --> 01:08:28.481
All right, John,
I'm gonna remove the skull.

562
01:08:54.211 --> 01:08:55.735
He's stabilized.

563
01:08:58.048 --> 01:08:59.276
John, I need you
to raise your hand

564
01:08:59.383 --> 01:09:00.748
and flex your fingers.

565
01:09:07.958 --> 01:09:09.550
John?

566
01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:11.457
John, raise your hand...
hand...

567
01:09:14.331 --> 01:09:15.798
John, can you hear me?

568
01:09:18.335 --> 01:09:19.666
What's happening?

569
01:09:21.171 --> 01:09:23.162
John.

570
01:09:23.273 --> 01:09:24.604
What's happening to him?

571
01:09:24.708 --> 01:09:26.801
What's happening?

572
01:09:28.846 --> 01:09:30.143
What's wrong?

573
01:09:37.187 --> 01:09:38.484
What's wrong?

574
01:09:40.524 --> 01:09:43.254
Why isn't he moving?

575
01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:45.055
Do something!

576
01:09:45.162 --> 01:09:46.652
Please.

577
01:09:50.367 --> 01:09:51.493
Stay with me, John.

578
01:09:55.038 --> 01:09:57.438
Good.

579
01:09:57.541 --> 01:09:59.270
- I love you.
- I love you.

580
01:09:59.376 --> 01:10:02.402
Breathe!
Breathe, damn it.

581
01:10:02.513 --> 01:10:04.105
Breathe, John.

582
01:10:04.214 --> 01:10:05.545
I love...

583
01:10:05.649 --> 01:10:07.276
Breathe.

584
01:10:12.055 --> 01:10:14.615
I...

585
01:10:14.725 --> 01:10:17.023
I love you.

586
01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:52.228
You will give everything to me.

587
01:10:54.765 --> 01:10:56.232
Every cell in your body.

588
01:10:58.602 --> 01:10:59.626
Is that understood?

589
01:11:00.938 --> 01:11:01.927
Yes.

590
01:11:05.609 --> 01:11:10.273
The marks on your arms...
they're from another life.

591
01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:12.940
We'll leave that life behind.

592
01:11:16.119 --> 01:11:18.087
When you go down
that corridor...

593
01:11:23.293 --> 01:11:24.851
there is no turning back.

594
01:11:24.962 --> 01:11:26.793
Do you understand that?

595
01:11:28.465 --> 01:11:29.989
Yes.

596
01:11:31.301 --> 01:11:32.768
Then start with this.

597
01:11:44.648 --> 01:11:45.945
Go.

598
01:12:09.506 --> 01:12:11.736
Who is that?

599
01:12:11.842 --> 01:12:13.036
Who's in there?

600
01:12:14.344 --> 01:12:15.811
I'll kill you, you motherfucker!

601
01:12:17.848 --> 01:12:19.816
I'll kill you, you motherfucker!

602
01:13:33.023 --> 01:13:35.116
Put his left leg in the shackle.

603
01:15:00.577 --> 01:15:02.943
It's time to start our game.

604
01:15:31.508 --> 01:15:32.805
What's that?

605
01:15:32.909 --> 01:15:35.434
Slow my heart rate.

606
01:15:35.545 --> 01:15:37.706
Relax my muscles.

607
01:15:42.219 --> 01:15:43.777
It's time.

608
01:15:47.524 --> 01:15:49.856
Close the door behind you.

609
01:17:29.926 --> 01:17:31.826
He can't hear you.

610
01:17:31.928 --> 01:17:34.158
He doesn't even know you're there.

611
01:17:44.074 --> 01:17:45.564
Amanda.

612
01:17:46.309 --> 01:17:48.277
Put... it... away.

613
01:17:48.378 --> 01:17:50.005
Trust me.

614
01:17:50.814 --> 01:17:52.645
Put it away.

615
01:17:56.753 --> 01:17:58.618
Leave us alone.

616
01:18:00.056 --> 01:18:02.081
Now.

617
01:18:02.192 --> 01:18:03.921
You fucking freak.

618
01:18:05.495 --> 01:18:08.089
I apologize for her behavior.

619
01:18:09.699 --> 01:18:11.633
She swims in my sea.

620
01:18:13.136 --> 01:18:15.366
In the end,
she will be the closest

621
01:18:15.472 --> 01:18:18.373
I've ever come to a connection,

622
01:18:18.475 --> 01:18:19.942
to being understood.

623
01:18:22.812 --> 01:18:27.272
But her emotion
is also her... weakness.

624
01:21:26.397 --> 01:21:27.364
Adam.

625
01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:30.458
Adam.

626
01:21:39.144 --> 01:21:40.805
Come here.

627
01:21:40.912 --> 01:21:42.209
I'm gonna help you.

628
01:21:43.748 --> 01:21:45.045
I'm gonna help you.

629
01:21:49.921 --> 01:21:51.548
I'm gonna free you.

630
01:22:21.085 --> 01:22:22.279
Adam!

631
01:23:17.742 --> 01:23:20.472
I'm so sorry about your son, Jeff.

632
01:23:22.413 --> 01:23:25.075
But let me tell you something that I...

633
01:23:25.183 --> 01:23:26.411
that I know for sure.

634
01:23:26.517 --> 01:23:30.453
No sentence I gave him,
not 500 years,

635
01:23:30.555 --> 01:23:35.424
not even death, nothing,
will take your pain away.

636
01:23:35.526 --> 01:23:38.586
And vengeance doesn't
solve anything.

637
01:23:38.696 --> 01:23:41.824
It only makes
the pain greater, Jeff.

638
01:24:03.888 --> 01:24:05.753
What the...
What the fuck?

639
01:24:07.558 --> 01:24:08.889
Somebody, help me!

640
01:24:10.595 --> 01:24:12.290
What the fuck?

641
01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:16.697
Help.

642
01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:25.038
What the fu--
What the fuck are you doin'?

643
01:24:27.345 --> 01:24:28.312
Please help me.

644
01:24:30.748 --> 01:24:31.976
Hello, Jeff.

645
01:24:32.083 --> 01:24:33.710
If you are listening to this,

646
01:24:33.818 --> 01:24:38.653
that means that the confrontation
you so long dreamed of

647
01:24:38.756 --> 01:24:40.314
is finally unfolding.

648
01:24:40.425 --> 01:24:42.154
Do something!

649
01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:44.990
In your head he is a cipher,

650
01:24:45.096 --> 01:24:47.257
a symbol of your life changing,

651
01:24:47.365 --> 01:24:48.662
a symbol of death.

652
01:24:48.766 --> 01:24:54.170
I present him to you now
as a simple human being.

653
01:24:54.272 --> 01:24:55.671
His name is Timothy Young.

654
01:24:55.773 --> 01:24:57.502
He's 27 years old,

655
01:24:57.608 --> 01:25:00.168
a medical student
with a mother and a father

656
01:25:00.278 --> 01:25:02.075
just like you,

657
01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:05.946
a man whose life also changed
the day your son died.

658
01:25:10.488 --> 01:25:12.854
That day he made
a terrible mistake.

659
01:25:18.596 --> 01:25:20.427
You believed he didn't pay
for that mistake,

660
01:25:20.531 --> 01:25:23.830
and now is your chance
to make him pay.

661
01:25:23.935 --> 01:25:28.770
The device Timothy is strapped to
is my personal favorite.

662
01:25:28.873 --> 01:25:30.170
I call it the rack.

663
01:25:35.913 --> 01:25:39.440
The human body
is a miraculous creation.

664
01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:43.281
Ever wonder how far
the arm can twist?

665
01:25:43.388 --> 01:25:46.289
This device is going
to start twisting.

666
01:25:46.391 --> 01:25:49.121
There is a chance he might live,
though, with your help.

667
01:25:49.227 --> 01:25:50.125
Please...

668
01:25:50.228 --> 01:25:52.958
To your right is a box.

669
01:25:53.064 --> 01:25:54.998
At the back of the box is a key.

670
01:25:55.099 --> 01:25:57.795
It's tied to the trigger of a shotgun.

671
01:25:57.902 --> 01:26:00.302
The question you have to
ask yourself is this...

672
01:26:02.507 --> 01:26:03.474
Are you willing...

673
01:26:03.574 --> 01:26:04.973
Have mercy!

674
01:26:05.076 --> 01:26:08.568
...to take a bullet for the man
who killed your son?

675
01:26:08.679 --> 01:26:11.307
Does "Do unto others as you
would have them do unto you"

676
01:26:11.416 --> 01:26:13.179
apply here, Jeff?

677
01:26:13.284 --> 01:26:14.774
Make your choice.

678
01:27:04.135 --> 01:27:05.568
My God.

679
01:27:14.946 --> 01:27:17.107
You've got to help him, Jeff!

680
01:27:24.355 --> 01:27:25.379
Fuck me!

681
01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:27.515
Please stop! Stop!

682
01:27:27.625 --> 01:27:29.957
Stop! Please stop!

683
01:27:45.109 --> 01:27:46.406
Jeff!

684
01:27:50.548 --> 01:27:52.379
Jeff!

685
01:27:52.483 --> 01:27:55.816
Just standing there
you're an accomplice to murder!

686
01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:56.944
Are you a murderer?

687
01:27:57.989 --> 01:28:00.321
I've wanted
to kill him every day.

688
01:28:00.424 --> 01:28:01.391
Oh, my God!

689
01:28:01.492 --> 01:28:05.155
For three years,
I wanted to kill you.

690
01:28:05.263 --> 01:28:06.730
Yeah, maybe I am.

691
01:28:06.831 --> 01:28:08.264
You'll lose your family.

692
01:28:08.366 --> 01:28:09.424
Oh, my God!

693
01:28:09.534 --> 01:28:10.762
Your wife, your daughter.

694
01:28:10.868 --> 01:28:12.859
I killed him.

695
01:28:14.705 --> 01:28:16.138
Fuck!

696
01:28:26.851 --> 01:28:27.818
Oh, God.

697
01:28:30.788 --> 01:28:32.653
Okay.

698
01:28:35.092 --> 01:28:36.423
Hold on, son.

699
01:28:59.283 --> 01:29:01.717
Hold on. Don't give up.

700
01:29:01.819 --> 01:29:02.843
Come on, son.

701
01:29:04.789 --> 01:29:06.984
Oh, God! Oh, God!

702
01:29:07.658 --> 01:29:08.920
Son.

703
01:29:20.471 --> 01:29:21.802
Got the key.

704
01:29:37.255 --> 01:29:39.348
Help me!

705
01:29:39.457 --> 01:29:40.515
Help me!

706
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:49.967
Help me!

707
01:29:50.067 --> 01:29:51.056
Stop!

708
01:29:52.436 --> 01:29:53.903
I forgive him!

709
01:29:56.941 --> 01:29:59.705
I forgive him! No!

710
01:29:59.810 --> 01:30:02.938
No!

711
01:30:03.047 --> 01:30:04.071
God!

712
01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:08.444
God damn you!

713
01:30:41.786 --> 01:30:43.811
Don't you think it would be wise

714
01:30:43.921 --> 01:30:48.324
to engage me in conversation
for your own sake?

715
01:30:48.426 --> 01:30:49.916
I asked you to tell me
about your husband.

716
01:30:54.332 --> 01:30:56.596
It's like we're strangers now.

717
01:30:56.701 --> 01:30:59.033
And?

718
01:30:59.136 --> 01:31:03.732
The last time I saw him,
we were so disconnected.

719
01:31:03.841 --> 01:31:05.001
But now...

720
01:31:07.712 --> 01:31:11.773
I'd give anything in the world...

721
01:31:15.486 --> 01:31:17.852
...to see my husband.

722
01:31:17.955 --> 01:31:20.287
Matrimony's always
fascinated me.

723
01:31:20.391 --> 01:31:22.825
Husbands barely able
to look at their wives,

724
01:31:22.927 --> 01:31:24.292
wives on their backs

725
01:31:24.395 --> 01:31:27.728
in motel rooms
with perfect strangers,

726
01:31:27.832 --> 01:31:30.494
people who bear children
only to neglect them.

727
01:31:30.601 --> 01:31:33.229
Till death do us part, indeed.

728
01:31:33.337 --> 01:31:36.568
I don't know
what you think you know,

729
01:31:36.674 --> 01:31:39.404
but my marriage has
survived more suffering

730
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:41.978
than someone like you
could ever grasp.

731
01:31:42.079 --> 01:31:43.046
Suffering?

732
01:31:44.682 --> 01:31:46.309
You haven't seen anything yet.

733
01:31:49.453 --> 01:31:51.114
Someone like me?
Who am I?

734
01:31:51.222 --> 01:31:53.588
A monster.

735
01:31:53.691 --> 01:31:54.623
A murderer.

736
01:31:54.725 --> 01:31:56.249
I don't condone murder,

737
01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:59.955
and I... despise murderers.

738
01:32:00.064 --> 01:32:02.589
Please.

739
01:32:08.038 --> 01:32:10.700
Please... let me go.

740
01:32:17.648 --> 01:32:18.580
We're fine, Amanda.

741
01:32:18.682 --> 01:32:20.616
We don't need you.

742
01:32:25.022 --> 01:32:26.114
I said, we're fine.

743
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000
He needs you.

744
01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:08.080
Why is this door open?

745
01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:26.828
If you make it through this, Lynn,

746
01:36:26.938 --> 01:36:29.372
you're gonna thank me one day
just as Amanda did.

747
01:36:37.215 --> 01:36:39.945
Please, let me go.

748
01:36:40.051 --> 01:36:43.509
I saved your life.

749
01:36:43.621 --> 01:36:46.681
Maybe my life isn't the one
you were saving after all.

750
01:36:51.129 --> 01:36:52.858
Tell me about your daughter.

751
01:36:52.964 --> 01:36:55.432
I understand she's quite
a little athlete.

752
01:37:02.006 --> 01:37:04.531
Or we could talk about your son.

753
01:37:04.642 --> 01:37:05.973
What did you say?

754
01:37:09.914 --> 01:37:11.381
Why are you living with the dead

755
01:37:11.483 --> 01:37:13.576
when you have such
a beautiful family,

756
01:37:13.685 --> 01:37:17.883
a husband who is indeed alone,

757
01:37:17.989 --> 01:37:20.321
a daughter who needs her mother,

758
01:37:20.425 --> 01:37:23.883
patients who need
a competent physician

759
01:37:23.995 --> 01:37:25.860
who looks them in the eye

760
01:37:25.964 --> 01:37:28.194
and treats them
like human beings?

761
01:37:28.299 --> 01:37:30.324
He's completed the third test.

762
01:37:30.435 --> 01:37:32.801
Congratulations, Lynn.

763
01:37:32.904 --> 01:37:33.996
You're free to go.

764
01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:37.901
Yeah, but he's not
all the way out yet.

765
01:37:39.544 --> 01:37:42.513
Undo her collar, Amanda,
and let her go.

766
01:37:42.614 --> 01:37:45.242
No, he's not finished.

767
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:46.908
He's not all the way.

768
01:37:47.018 --> 01:37:50.920
Amanda, Lynn is more important
than you know.

769
01:37:51.022 --> 01:37:55.015
Unlock her collar and let her go.

770
01:37:55.126 --> 01:37:57.356
I said no.

771
01:38:01.533 --> 01:38:03.091
Amanda, there are rules.

772
01:38:03.201 --> 01:38:04.429
I said no!

773
01:38:06.538 --> 01:38:08.438
She doesn't deserve to go free.

774
01:38:08.540 --> 01:38:09.507
You promised.

775
01:38:09.607 --> 01:38:11.040
I didn't promise you shit.

776
01:38:11.142 --> 01:38:13.633
Amanda, even with that gun,

777
01:38:13.745 --> 01:38:18.808
it is Lynn who holds
your life in her hand.

778
01:38:18.917 --> 01:38:19.906
Fuck you.

779
01:38:20.018 --> 01:38:22.248
You give her control over me?

780
01:38:22.353 --> 01:38:23.718
Fuck you!

781
01:38:23.822 --> 01:38:25.915
I won't tell anyone.
I promise I won't.

782
01:38:26.024 --> 01:38:27.321
Please, I have a family.

783
01:38:27.425 --> 01:38:30.087
Shut up, shut up,
shut up, shut up!

784
01:38:30.195 --> 01:38:32.220
And stop fuckin' moving around!

785
01:38:32.330 --> 01:38:35.766
And what about the other
test subjects that we left alive?

786
01:38:35.867 --> 01:38:36.697
Game over.

787
01:38:36.801 --> 01:38:38.530
I'll fucking kill you!

788
01:38:38.636 --> 01:38:40.035
What about them?

789
01:38:40.138 --> 01:38:42.368
Was that how you felt about them?

790
01:38:45.210 --> 01:38:47.644
Was that how you felt
about Eric Matthews?

791
01:38:47.745 --> 01:38:48.769
Eric Matthews.

792
01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:50.040
<i>Let me go.</i>

793
01:38:50.148 --> 01:38:53.845
I'll tell you how I felt
about Eric Matthews.

794
01:39:22.514 --> 01:39:24.277
Daniel!

795
01:39:28.853 --> 01:39:29.649
Fuck.

796
01:39:29.754 --> 01:39:31.619
Daniel!

797
01:39:43.768 --> 01:39:45.531
Daniel?

798
01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:16.694
Fuck!

799
01:41:24.268 --> 01:41:25.701
Where's my son?

800
01:41:28.106 --> 01:41:30.472
Where is he, you junkie bitch?

801
01:41:34.479 --> 01:41:35.946
Where is he?

802
01:41:49.661 --> 01:41:51.561
Tell me where he is.

803
01:41:51.663 --> 01:41:53.324
Tell me where he is.

804
01:41:53.431 --> 01:41:55.092
Right fuckin' here.

805
01:42:13.851 --> 01:42:15.375
You bitch!

806
01:42:20.091 --> 01:42:22.116
You're nothin', bitch!

807
01:42:24.395 --> 01:42:26.522
You're nothing!

808
01:42:31.836 --> 01:42:33.531
You're not Jigsaw.

809
01:42:37.642 --> 01:42:40.133
You're not Jigsaw, bitch!

810
01:42:49.887 --> 01:42:51.752
You hear me?

811
01:42:52.657 --> 01:42:54.181
You're nothing!

812
01:42:56.761 --> 01:42:59.025
You're not Jigsaw, bitch.

813
01:43:02.433 --> 01:43:04.025
You're nothin'!

814
01:43:07.605 --> 01:43:10.369
I'll fuckin' kill you!

815
01:43:10.475 --> 01:43:11.442
No!

816
01:43:11.809 --> 01:43:13.242
That's right.

817
01:43:13.344 --> 01:43:15.642
I'm a murderer.

818
01:43:15.747 --> 01:43:18.272
He took my life from me,

819
01:43:18.382 --> 01:43:20.612
so I just returned
the fuckin' favor.

820
01:43:20.718 --> 01:43:23.619
No, Amanda,
that's what you thought,

821
01:43:23.721 --> 01:43:26.189
but I know different.

822
01:43:26.290 --> 01:43:28.781
You left him for dead, didn't you?

823
01:43:28.893 --> 01:43:30.292
Stop fucking with me.

824
01:43:30.394 --> 01:43:33.625
But I cleaned up
your mistakes.

825
01:43:33.731 --> 01:43:35.995
I forgave you for them.

826
01:43:38.069 --> 01:43:39.866
Let me go! Please!

827
01:43:39.971 --> 01:43:42.963
What you do
is no different than murder.

828
01:43:43.074 --> 01:43:45.907
You torture people.
You watch them die.

829
01:43:46.010 --> 01:43:48.979
But now you're begging me
not to kill this worthless bitch

830
01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:50.809
on the grounds of some game?

831
01:43:50.915 --> 01:43:53.145
You are walking us
toward a precipice, Amanda.

832
01:43:53.251 --> 01:43:54.809
Step back.

833
01:43:54.919 --> 01:43:56.216
It's bullshit.

834
01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:58.811
Nobody changes.

835
01:43:58.923 --> 01:43:59.890
It's all a lie.

836
01:43:59.991 --> 01:44:01.891
If you fail in this, we all fail.

837
01:44:01.993 --> 01:44:04.154
Succeed, and we all succeed.

838
01:44:04.262 --> 01:44:05.889
It's a lie!

839
01:44:11.269 --> 01:44:14.204
I'll tell you,
she hasn't changed,

840
01:44:14.305 --> 01:44:16.603
because nobody fuckin' changes.

841
01:44:18.776 --> 01:44:20.004
Nobody is reborn.

842
01:44:20.111 --> 01:44:21.237
It's all bullshit!

843
01:44:21.345 --> 01:44:23.336
It's all a fuckin' lie!

844
01:44:23.447 --> 01:44:26.245
And I'm just a pawn
in your stupid games.

845
01:44:39.297 --> 01:44:41.288
I don't mean anything to you.

846
01:44:41.399 --> 01:44:44.027
No, you mean everything to me.

847
01:44:44.135 --> 01:44:45.864
Fuck you!

848
01:44:45.970 --> 01:44:47.733
Our fates are linked.

849
01:44:49.207 --> 01:44:51.300
I've tried to help you, Amanda.

850
01:44:51.409 --> 01:44:53.274
So, help me!

851
01:44:53.377 --> 01:44:54.935
Fix me!

852
01:44:56.581 --> 01:44:58.173
Fix me, motherfucker!

853
01:44:59.917 --> 01:45:06.789
I'm standin' right here.

854
01:45:06.891 --> 01:45:08.188
Why is she so important to you?

855
01:45:09.694 --> 01:45:11.753
She's not important to me.

856
01:45:13.598 --> 01:45:15.122
She's important to you.

857
01:45:15.233 --> 01:45:17.463
She's not important to me.

858
01:45:17.568 --> 01:45:21.197
I beg you to reconsider that.

859
01:45:27.011 --> 01:45:28.876
This is your last chance, Amanda.

860
01:45:28.980 --> 01:45:30.242
She's nothing.

861
01:45:47.131 --> 01:45:49.099
Your time's running out.

862
01:45:52.737 --> 01:45:54.398
Now, you think about
what you're doing.

863
01:45:58.376 --> 01:46:00.674
Think about everything
that you've done.

864
01:46:08.219 --> 01:46:11.017
You think about
what you promised me.

865
01:46:11.122 --> 01:46:13.784
Think about our dreams.

866
01:46:13.891 --> 01:46:15.518
Think about tomorrow.

867
01:46:18.529 --> 01:46:19.996
Lynn?

868
01:46:20.097 --> 01:46:21.724
Jeff! Jeff--

869
01:46:22.867 --> 01:46:23.925
Lynn.

870
01:46:26.570 --> 01:46:28.538
Lynn.

871
01:46:28.639 --> 01:46:29.765
- Lynn.
- Jeff.

872
01:46:30.675 --> 01:46:32.336
You just destroyed four lives.

873
01:46:33.611 --> 01:46:35.306
You just murdered Jeff's wife.

874
01:46:55.299 --> 01:46:56.960
Baby.

875
01:46:57.068 --> 01:46:58.433
Amanda.

876
01:47:01.172 --> 01:47:02.139
It's okay.

877
01:47:08.279 --> 01:47:09.439
This was your test...

878
01:47:10.982 --> 01:47:12.574
...your game.

879
01:47:14.785 --> 01:47:16.150
What do I want?

880
01:47:16.253 --> 01:47:17.914
I want to play a game.

881
01:47:20.558 --> 01:47:21.684
You're being tested.

882
01:47:21.792 --> 01:47:22.918
Your will is being tested--

883
01:47:23.027 --> 01:47:24.927
Your will to keep someone alive.

884
01:47:25.029 --> 01:47:25.996
Can you do that?

885
01:47:26.097 --> 01:47:29.897
Can you follow the rules
and grant someone the gift of life?

886
01:47:32.303 --> 01:47:33.964
I was testing you.

887
01:47:34.071 --> 01:47:35.936
I took you in.

888
01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:38.031
You will give everything to me.

889
01:47:38.142 --> 01:47:39.131
Yes.

890
01:47:39.243 --> 01:47:40.301
Every cell in your body.

891
01:47:40.411 --> 01:47:45.405
I selected you for the honor
of carrying on my life's work.

892
01:47:45.516 --> 01:47:47.381
But you didn't.

893
01:47:47.485 --> 01:47:48.452
That's right.

894
01:47:50.421 --> 01:47:51.410
I'm a murderer.

895
01:47:51.522 --> 01:47:52.716
I despise murderers.

896
01:47:52.823 --> 01:47:55.053
You didn't test anyone's will to live.

897
01:47:55.159 --> 01:47:56.524
Game over.

898
01:47:57.828 --> 01:48:00.388
Instead you took away
their only chance.

899
01:48:00.498 --> 01:48:03.126
Your games were unwinnable.

900
01:48:03.234 --> 01:48:04.963
Your subjects merely victims.

901
01:48:05.069 --> 01:48:06.627
You.

902
01:48:07.571 --> 01:48:08.697
There is no turning back.

903
01:48:08.806 --> 01:48:10.797
Do you understand that?

904
01:48:10.908 --> 01:48:16.346
In my desperation,
I decided to give you one last chance.

905
01:48:16.447 --> 01:48:19.245
So I put everything in place.

906
01:48:20.618 --> 01:48:22.347
You chose her 'cause
she's the best, right?

907
01:48:22.453 --> 01:48:24.250
That's one reason I chose her.

908
01:48:24.355 --> 01:48:28.416
You didn't know that Lynn and Jeff
were husband and wife.

909
01:48:28.526 --> 01:48:33.725
I had to keep that from you
for the purposes of my game.

910
01:48:33.831 --> 01:48:36.026
I had to leave out
the ruined marriage,

911
01:48:36.133 --> 01:48:39.296
the cheating wife,

912
01:48:39.403 --> 01:48:44.136
the vengeful husband,
the neglected daughter.

913
01:48:44.241 --> 01:48:49.144
And I let you make
your own choices.

914
01:48:49.246 --> 01:48:52.443
I wanted you to succeed.

915
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:55.576
Amanda, put it away.

916
01:48:55.686 --> 01:48:57.916
Trust me, even with that gun,

917
01:48:58.022 --> 01:49:01.685
it's Lynn who holds
your life in her hands.

918
01:49:01.792 --> 01:49:03.350
She's not important to me.

919
01:49:03.461 --> 01:49:05.986
I beg you to reconsider that.

920
01:49:06.097 --> 01:49:07.928
Unlock her collar
and let her go.

921
01:49:08.032 --> 01:49:10.364
I said no!

922
01:49:10.468 --> 01:49:12.595
The rules of our game
have been made very clear.

923
01:49:12.703 --> 01:49:15.001
You need to abide by those rules.

924
01:49:17.074 --> 01:49:18.041
You couldn't.

925
01:49:24.381 --> 01:49:26.076
God.

926
01:49:42.066 --> 01:49:43.192
Game over.

927
01:49:55.746 --> 01:49:57.805
You haven't learned anything tonight,
have you?

928
01:49:57.915 --> 01:50:02.113
Your rage and your vengeance
will only hurt the ones you love.

929
01:50:02.219 --> 01:50:05.484
Killing me will only add
to your misery.

930
01:50:05.589 --> 01:50:08.251
It will not bring back your son.

931
01:50:08.359 --> 01:50:10.327
Think of your daughter, Jeff.

932
01:50:10.427 --> 01:50:14.420
She needs you now
more than ever.

933
01:50:14.532 --> 01:50:16.523
You can't kill me, Jeff.

934
01:50:26.177 --> 01:50:28.236
Your wife's dying, Jeff.

935
01:50:28.345 --> 01:50:31.781
Her time's running out.

936
01:50:39.790 --> 01:50:43.521
Jeff, do not miscalculate.

937
01:50:43.627 --> 01:50:45.288
Your fate is in my hands.

938
01:50:45.396 --> 01:50:48.194
Your wife's fate is in my hands.

939
01:50:48.299 --> 01:50:50.529
I love you.

940
01:50:50.634 --> 01:50:52.261
I love you.

941
01:50:56.140 --> 01:50:58.700
I'm taking you home. Okay?

942
01:50:58.809 --> 01:51:02.370
Though you may not
see any threat...

943
01:51:02.479 --> 01:51:04.743
there are threats all around you.

944
01:51:04.848 --> 01:51:07.715
Jeff, if you try to move your wife,
she will die.

945
01:51:07.818 --> 01:51:10.582
I can have an ambulance here
in four minutes.

946
01:51:10.688 --> 01:51:13.384
Would you like to take your wife
out of here tonight?

947
01:51:13.490 --> 01:51:14.980
Would you like
to take her to safety?

948
01:51:15.092 --> 01:51:16.218
Stay.

949
01:51:16.327 --> 01:51:17.851
Stand and face me, Jeff.

950
01:51:17.962 --> 01:51:21.159
- Stay with me, please.
- Right now.

951
01:51:21.265 --> 01:51:24.598
Would you like to get your life back?

952
01:51:24.702 --> 01:51:25.600
Would you, Jeff?

953
01:51:25.703 --> 01:51:27.295
I can make that happen.

954
01:51:29.807 --> 01:51:31.798
Which is it, Jeff?

955
01:51:31.909 --> 01:51:34.104
Come on... yes or no?

956
01:51:34.211 --> 01:51:35.200
Yes.

957
01:51:38.415 --> 01:51:39.677
What do you want?

958
01:51:39.783 --> 01:51:41.375
One final test.

959
01:51:41.485 --> 01:51:43.316
The rules are simple.

960
01:51:43.420 --> 01:51:47.652
Over on that table,
there's a host of vicious implements...

961
01:51:48.993 --> 01:51:52.554
which you can use
to exact your pound of flesh,

962
01:51:52.663 --> 01:51:53.994
to take your vengeance,

963
01:51:54.098 --> 01:51:57.329
to indulge your obsession.

964
01:51:57.434 --> 01:52:02.599
Or you can choose to put
your vengeance aside,

965
01:52:02.706 --> 01:52:04.731
and you can forgive.

966
01:52:06.443 --> 01:52:09.844
You can forgive me for the pain

967
01:52:09.947 --> 01:52:12.643
that I've caused you
and your wife tonight.

968
01:52:14.118 --> 01:52:15.176
Jeff.

969
01:52:15.286 --> 01:52:16.913
Which is it gonna be, Jeff?

970
01:52:21.358 --> 01:52:23.349
Honey, don't do it.

971
01:52:23.460 --> 01:52:25.587
Jeff...

972
01:52:27.464 --> 01:52:29.022
It's up to you.

973
01:52:29.133 --> 01:52:30.191
I need you.

974
01:52:30.301 --> 01:52:33.361
Live or die, Jeff?

975
01:52:33.470 --> 01:52:35.267
Make our choice.

976
01:52:52.856 --> 01:52:53.948
I forgive you.

977
01:53:00.864 --> 01:53:03.230
Jeff...

978
01:53:03.334 --> 01:53:05.928
Jeff. Jeff!

979
01:53:14.945 --> 01:53:16.037
Jeff, no.

980
01:53:30.327 --> 01:53:32.420
I forgive you.

981
01:54:49.775 --> 01:54:51.538
Hello, Jeff.

982
01:54:51.643 --> 01:54:56.103
I made this tape
as an insurance policy, if you will.

983
01:54:59.251 --> 01:55:02.687
And if you're listening to it,
then it's time to collect.

984
01:55:05.257 --> 01:55:08.351
I was your final test of forgiveness.

985
01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:13.155
And if you are listening to this,

986
01:55:13.262 --> 01:55:15.196
then you failed.

987
01:55:16.532 --> 01:55:19.797
Now you must pay the price...

988
01:55:19.902 --> 01:55:22.462
the price for holding onto
all that anger.

989
01:55:22.850 --> 01:55:26.014
The price of driving your
own wife away from you.

990
01:55:26.015 --> 01:55:29.015
The price of living for
nothing but vengeance.

991
01:55:29.016 --> 01:55:31.516
Now I will give you something
to live for.

992
01:55:32.592 --> 01:55:35.322
I told you that
you couldn't kill me, Jeff,

993
01:55:36.228 --> 01:55:38.594
but I didn't tell you why,

994
01:55:39.098 --> 01:55:40.258
and the answer is simple.

995
01:55:40.916 --> 01:55:45.751
I am the person responsible
for the loss of your child.

996
01:55:46.254 --> 01:55:51.851
I am the only person who knows
where your daughter is.

997
01:55:52.610 --> 01:55:55.579
She only has a limited supply of air,

998
01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:56.942
and if you want to get her back,

999
01:55:57.248 --> 01:55:59.273
you'll have to play a game.
