1
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.280
Ah!

2
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.420
Where is he? Where is he hiding?

3
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.220
I don't know. I've been looking
for him since yesterday.

4
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.600
I'm gonna ask you for the last time.
Where is he?

5
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.610
I don't know.

6
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.370
What are you gonna do to him?

7
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.560
Stay here in case
that rat shows up.

8
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.010
Okay.

9
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.250
Who you protecting,
you dumb asshole?

10
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.980
A stoolie who rats
on his own friends?

11
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.160
They were your friends too.

12
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.290
I got it. You wanna end up
like that bitch, huh?

13
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:33.230
At Chun Lao's. Chinese theater.

14
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.940
You stay here
with this barrel of shit.

15
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:10.830
Noodles. Noodles. Noodles.

16
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.550
Easy, easy...

17
00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.010
This way. Hurry!

18
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:44.840
There down. Mott Street.
Go. Go. Go.

19
00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.510
Noodles.

20
00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.400
Noodles.

21
00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.330
Noodles.

22
00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:04.500
Untie me.

23
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:09.280
Stay that way. No, stay.
I want them to know I did it.

24
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:15.880
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna go get Eve.

25
00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.500
Don't.

26
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.960
Why?

27
00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.180
They... They already been there.

28
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.380
Do you need anything?

29
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.000
Money?

30
00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:16.100
- I got more than I need.
- Yeah, it's all yours now.

31
00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.920
Where to?

32
00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.720
Sir, where do you want to go?

33
00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:37.320
Anywhere. First bus.

34
00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.490
Buffalo?

35
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.210
One way.

36
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:53.200
That'll be $1.20.

37
00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:07.560
I wanna rent a car.

38
00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:10.460
Would you fill this out, please?

39
00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:19.070
Shoot the dice, man.
Shoot the dice.

40
00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.270
Noodles.

41
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:18.880
I brought back
the key to your clock.

42
00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:29.950
Lock the door.

43
00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:45.920
When did you get back?

44
00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:48.640
Today.

45
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.010
Why?

46
00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:54.100
They got in touch with me.

47
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.560
Who?

48
00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.860
I thought you might know.

49
00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:00.650
Me?

50
00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:04.600
I don't know nothing
about nobody no more.

51
00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.130
You gonna offer me a drink?

52
00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:32.050
Yeah, forgive me. Sure. Of course.

53
00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:34.550
Please sit down.

54
00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:02.790
Who's Robert Williams?

55
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.740
I am.

56
00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.890
"We wish to inform you
that following the sale

57
00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:18.260
of the Beth Israel Cemetery".

58
00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:22.690
The synagogue sent these out if you
wanted to relocate your loved ones.

59
00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:26.140
I got the same letter
on account of my father.

60
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:31.200
Only the synagogue didn't send that.
I got that last week.

61
00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:34.110
The rabbi told me he sent those out
eight months ago.

62
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:37.940
Yeah, that's right.
That's about when I got mine.

63
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.250
So, what else did the rabbi say?

64
00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:47.000
He said I was lucky.
The bodies of Philip Stein,

65
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.010
Maximilian Bercovicz, Patrick
Goldberg were already spoken for.

66
00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:56.710
And they were up in a very fancy
cemetery in Riverdale.

67
00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.930
What's this all mean?

68
00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:04.180
It means...

69
00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:09.480
"Noodles, though you've been hiding
in the asshole of the world,

70
00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:13.740
we found you.
We know where you are."

71
00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.010
It means...

72
00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:18.190
"Get ready."

73
00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:22.070
For what?

74
00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:28.320
That's the one thing it didn't say.

75
00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.160
What do you think?

76
00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:03.690
I think the answer's here.
That's why I came back.

77
00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:09.020
Hmm.

78
00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.630
I moved everything in here.

79
00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.550
I had to sell the house,
the backroom.

80
00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.480
I always thought
you might have helped yourself

81
00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:41.060
to that million bucks.
But now I know.

82
00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.930
You're...

83
00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.150
You're on your ass worse than ever.

84
00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:52.960
But I thought it was you who...

85
00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.610
No, you thought wrong.

86
00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:00.250
The suitcase was empty.

87
00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:04.960
Then who took it?

88
00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:13.130
That's what I've been asking myself
for 35 years.

89
00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:27.410
If it bothers you, I can sleep here.

90
00:34:27.410 --> 00:34:31.900
- You can have my room.
- No. It's okay.

91
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:55.770
- How's your sister?
- I ain't seen her for years.

92
00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:58.640
She's a big star now.

93
00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.340
We should have known, huh?

94
00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:07.990
You can always tell the winners
at the starting gate.

95
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:12.350
You can always tell the winners,
and you can tell the losers.

96
00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:16.360
Who would've put a penny on you?

97
00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.240
I'd have put everything
I ever had on you.

98
00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.580
Yeah, and you would've lost.

99
00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:42.770
Well, you're beat. Good night.

100
00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:45.800
Good night, Moe. Thanks.

101
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:54.230
What have you been doing
all these years?

102
00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:00.240
Been going to bed early.

103
00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:52.570
Deborah, Papa says you should help.

104
00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:54.200
No.

105
00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:57.620
We got customers all over.
We can't do everything.

106
00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:01.700
Try. I've got my elocution lessons.

107
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:56.990
Fat, you better spray the toilet.
I saw a cockroach in there.

108
00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:15.430
- Sorry.
- Meshuga!

109
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:24.580
Sorry,
I can't make it today.

110
00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:26.980
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

111
00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:36.990
Sorry, Fats.

112
00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:46.470
- Noodles!
- Bugsy's got a job for us.

113
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:48.920
Hurry up.
He don't wait.

114
00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:24.340
Who you calling
a cockroach?

115
00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:27.720
So, what are you?
You're filthy, you make me sick.

116
00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:32.020
You crawl up toilet walls
just like a roach. So, what are you?

117
00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:33.770
Let go!

118
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:38.100
I make you sick, huh? Then how come
you showed me your tush?

119
00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:40.690
To a roach.

120
00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:47.650
Go look at yourself, David Aaronson.

121
00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:06.180
She don't leave me alone, I'm gonna
give her what she's asking for.

122
00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:08.930
- What's Bugsy want?
- We gotta wake up a deadbeat.

123
00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:12.420
That schmuck at the newsstand
didn't pay.

124
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:03.640
Here's your money, sir.

125
00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:25.450
Beautiful.

126
00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:33.290
Look at it, it looks great! Wow!

127
00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:42.930
Come on, guys.

128
00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:54.030
Come on, come on.

129
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:56.620
Now make up your mind.

130
00:45:56.620 --> 00:46:00.250
- Noodles, let's take the dollar.
- Yeah.

131
00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:03.150
Skip, here you go.

132
00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:06.830
That one.

133
00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:08.920
Him.

134
00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:11.880
Hey, Sam,
I'll see you next Thursday.

135
00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:13.830
That one.

136
00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.010
Are you nuts?

137
00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:22.430
Bugsy said we could take the dollar
or we could roll the drunk.

138
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:25.440
Yeah, but he ain't even drunk yet.

139
00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:27.340
We'll wait.

140
00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:35.100
- Well, you roll that one over there.
- What's to roll? He drunk it all.

141
00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:42.070
Bounce that little shikker.

142
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:32.570
Jacket.

143
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:44.760
It's Fartface.

144
00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:49.670
Shit!

145
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:53.230
We should've took the dollar.

146
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:57.510
Could've had 10 corned beef
sandwiches on poppy-seed rolls.

147
00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:15.070
Look, the wagon will hide us
from Fartface. Get ready!

148
00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:46.480
Now! Throw your jacket over him.

149
00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:53.250
Mister, you sick? Poor guy,
you'll be okay. I'll help ya.

150
00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:56.250
Come on, up you go.

151
00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:59.090
Now, you're worse
than my Uncle Nathan.

152
00:48:59.090 --> 00:49:02.670
Why do you want to get soused?
I'll take you home.

153
00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:04.920
Go, Mama.

154
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:17.170
Stop right there. Hey, you!
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

155
00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:20.440
What are you kids doing here?

156
00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:24.780
- What are we kids doing here?
- We're getting it up the ass.

157
00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:28.200
Yeah, getting screwed.
Is there a law against it?

158
00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:32.330
Can you spare a dime for pisherkehs
that just got it up the ass?

159
00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:37.830
Get out of here.
Get off the street.

160
00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:40.210
Go ahead. And don't come back.

161
00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:43.870
I don't want to see you here again.
All right?

162
00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:19.520
Hey, stop by for you later.

163
00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:24.700
Yeah, but knock here
on the john first.

164
00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:28.960
My old man's praying,
and my old lady's crying.

165
00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.470
And the light's turned off.

166
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:36.920
What the hell should I go home for?
At least in here I can read.

167
00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:42.080
- Where are you going?
- Mama, don't get worked up.

168
00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:44.400
You got pots to clean.

169
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:50.630
Peggeleh?

170
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:54.030
I'll be right back, Ma.
I gotta go to the can.

171
00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:02.760
Hi, Peggy.

172
00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.790
At least you could lock the door.

173
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:10.680
Don't you like it?

174
00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:19.860
I've seen better.

175
00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:22.910
- You seen lots?
- How many you seen?

176
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:25.940
I'll tell you how many. None.

177
00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:32.280
Let me see yours.

178
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:49.500
Looksies, no feelsies.

179
00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:56.430
Peggy... Peggy, I...

180
00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:02.490
- You like it, don't you?
- Not for free, I don't.

181
00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:06.870
Bring me a charlotte russe, and
then you can do anything you like.

182
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:09.830
Tomorrow. I'll bring it
to you tomorrow.

183
00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:13.000
- I'll bring it tomorrow.
- I don't give credit.

184
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.670
I promise. I promise.

185
00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:19.250
You better stop squeezing me,
or I'm gonna poop in my pants.

186
00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:27.500
Well, you getting out?

187
00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:18.010
Come on, come on.

188
00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:47.410
Give me six copies.

189
00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:52.080
Drop your pants
and I'll stick it to you again.

190
00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:59.270
- What do you mean, "again"?
- That's a long story.

191
00:54:59.270 --> 00:55:02.480
And look what time it is.

192
00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:07.010
It's already 6:34. And I gotta go.

193
00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:10.450
Boy, I got a lot of work to do.

194
00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:12.570
Hold it a minute.

195
00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:17.620
Now it's 6:35.
And I ain't got a damn thing to do.

196
00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:21.620
Just you wait, asshole.
I'll do something with your time.

197
00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:23.120
Wait! Hey!

198
00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:25.590
Since we're talking about time...

199
00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:29.700
...it looks like you're gonna break
that lamp at 6:36.

200
00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:32.420
- Where'd you pinch this?
- It's mine.

201
00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:35.420
- Prove it.
- I gave it to him.

202
00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:38.310
Yeah?

203
00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:40.850
Who the hell are you?

204
00:55:40.850 --> 00:55:44.140
- Where you from?
- The Bronx.

205
00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:46.980
And you give away watches?

206
00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:49.480
He's my uncle.

207
00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:52.780
- And who gave it to you?
- My Uncle Nathan.

208
00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:55.110
My little brother.

209
00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:58.370
Tell your uncle
to stop by the precinct.

210
00:55:58.370 --> 00:56:00.450
- He's dead.
- Alcoholic.

211
00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:02.860
In Kishnev, Poland.

212
00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:10.790
Then he don't need it no more.
It's been requisitioned.

213
00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:16.590
- What's that mean?
- Pinched, by him. At 6:37.

214
00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:19.930
Just remember,
I got my eye on you two.

215
00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:22.350
I got my eye on you too.

216
00:56:22.350 --> 00:56:27.430
Take it! Take it!
Take the lamp off. I can't hold it.

217
00:56:28.310 --> 00:56:30.010
Max.

218
00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:36.020
Who's this?

219
00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:39.820
My uncle.

220
00:56:59.010 --> 00:57:03.390
- That one. With the cream.
- The 5-cent one?

221
00:57:03.390 --> 00:57:05.060
Yeah.

222
00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:07.470
For the two penny one she only gives
you a hand job.

223
00:57:07.470 --> 00:57:09.840
I can do that myself.

224
00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:12.600
Not that one!

225
00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:14.630
That one.

226
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:17.060
You sure?

227
00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:20.100
Wrap it up pretty.

228
00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:02.320
Good morning. Peggy home?

229
00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:04.450
She's taking a bath.

230
00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:07.240
That's great.
Would you tell her I'm here?

231
00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:11.070
Hey, Ma. Another bucket of water.

232
00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:14.230
Wait.

233
01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:46.770
- What do you want?
- Me?

234
01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:51.940
- Mama said you were looking for me.
- No. The guys told me that...

235
01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:56.520
- What?
- I'll come back some other time.

236
01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:32.980
Noodles!

237
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:38.230
Noodles! Noodles! Noodles!

238
01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:46.290
Did you get it?

239
01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:48.620
His asshole blinked, but we got him.

240
01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:51.250
Nice going, Fartface.
And on duty too.

241
01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:56.010
You boys caught me
with my pants down that time.

242
01:01:56.010 --> 01:01:59.220
No, we caught you
with your schmuck in a minor.

243
01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:03.260
- Put this someplace safe.
- That's all right. Hey, hold it!

244
01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:05.720
Where you going?
Hold it! Wait a minute!

245
01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.680
Hey, you, stop! Hold it.

246
01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.940
- What are you gonna do
with that plate? -Depends.

247
01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:12.850
What time is it, Max?

248
01:02:12.850 --> 01:02:16.690
I think it's time
we got our watch back.

249
01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:19.900
- Okay, boys, we're even.
- The hell we are.

250
01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:22.530
You'll be collecting
your pension before we're even.

251
01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:24.560
Hiya, fellas.

252
01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:26.990
What do you boys want?

253
01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:29.540
First off...

254
01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:31.790
...you're paying Peggy for us.

255
01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:34.330
Okay. That's it?

256
01:02:34.330 --> 01:02:36.670
Go ahead while I tell him.

257
01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:41.500
I can't believe it. My first time,
and a lousy cop's paying for it.

258
01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:46.850
Look, what else do you kids
want for that plate?

259
01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:53.060
Noodles was telling me about Bugsy.
Seems he's boss, thanks to you.

260
01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:56.360
- Meaning what?
- Meaning he pays you off.

261
01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:00.230
Will you slow down?
What is your hurry? Take it easy.

262
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:03.720
If you keep this up,
you're gonna come too fast.

263
01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:09.280
> Do you see what I mean? You're
so stupid. I can't believe it.

264
01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:14.990
So why does Bugsy pay you?
What do you do for him?

265
01:03:15.830 --> 01:03:20.210
- I close an eye once in a while.
- Well, now you close an eye for us.

266
01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:23.820
Why? What are you kids up to?

267
01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:28.930
He'll tell you.

268
01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:33.810
Me, him, Cockeye and Patsy,
we're working together.

269
01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:35.390
Bugsy'll flatten you.

270
01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:38.900
Besides, I don't put up
with no trouble on my beat.

271
01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:40.860
You'll put up, and you'll shut up.

272
01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:43.150
You hear nothing,
and you see nothing.

273
01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:45.190
Just like you did for Bugsy.

274
01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:46.820
Shit!

275
01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:52.030
Don't get upset. That makes it
worse. It can happen the first time.

276
01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:53.620
It's them two talking out there.

277
01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:56.540
Can't you see you're ruining
the mood?

278
01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:59.620
We made our deal.

279
01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:03.700
- So take a walk.
- Come here, honey.

280
01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:09.530
- Feel good, bubeleh?
- He'll never get it up.

281
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:16.460
Relax. Okay.
Calm down, calm down.

282
01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:25.470
Okay. Okay, come here.

283
01:05:44.850 --> 01:05:46.940
I'm glad the baby's better.

284
01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:51.680
- Happy Pesach, Deborah.
- Happy Pesach, Becky.

285
01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.910
Hurry. We're gonna be late.

286
01:05:59.910 --> 01:06:02.910
- There's Deborah.
- Sorry. Mama needed help.

287
01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:08.200
Good girl. I just locked up,
and I'm giving you the keys.

288
01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:24.970
I thought I'd just practice
my dance routines. All right?

289
01:06:24.970 --> 01:06:28.630
Make sure you don't let
the goyim in.

290
01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:33.310
- Okay, bye.
- See you later, Debbie. Bye.

291
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:48.010
Get down off of there,
roach.

292
01:07:48.010 --> 01:07:49.930
That record's just like Ex-Lax.

293
01:07:49.930 --> 01:07:54.090
Every time I put it on,
you have to go to the bathroom.

294
01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.950
What are you doing?

295
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:16.000
- Give me a drink.
- We're closed.

296
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.710
Nice people don't drink on Pesach.
They go to the synagogue.

297
01:08:20.710 --> 01:08:22.880
So, what are you doing here?

298
01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:25.800
Somebody's got to keep an eye
on the place.

299
01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:28.180
There are a lot of thieves
out there.

300
01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:30.220
One could get into your house.

301
01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:33.800
Especially if you leave
the door open.

302
01:09:05.670 --> 01:09:08.170
You can pray here too.

303
01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:14.000
Here or in the synagogue,
to God it's the same difference.

304
01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:17.840
Come over here and sit down.

305
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:53.550
"My beloved is white and ruddy.

306
01:09:53.550 --> 01:09:57.350
His skin is as the most fine gold.

307
01:09:57.350 --> 01:10:01.800
His cheeks are as a bed of spices."

308
01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:08.380
Even though he hasn't washed
since last December.

309
01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:15.360
"His eyes are as the eyes
of doves.

310
01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:18.240
His body is as bright ivory.

311
01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:22.570
His legs are as pillars of marble."

312
01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:27.320
In pants so dirty
they stand by themselves.

313
01:10:28.710 --> 01:10:32.320
"He is altogether lovable."

314
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:36.220
But he'll always be
a two-bit punk...

315
01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:41.550
...so he'll never be my beloved.
What a shame.

316
01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:14.740
Somebody's there.

317
01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:29.260
There ain't nobody.

318
01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.730
It's Max.

319
01:11:36.730 --> 01:11:40.570
So that's who it was.

320
01:11:40.570 --> 01:11:42.600
Noodles!

321
01:11:46.530 --> 01:11:49.610
Go on, run.
Your mother's calling you.

322
01:11:55.290 --> 01:11:57.070
Noodles!

323
01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.750
Just gonna go see what he wants.

324
01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:32.740
- Hey.
- Yo?

325
01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:38.860
- You been here long?
- No.

326
01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:42.200
Were you in there?

327
01:12:44.170 --> 01:12:46.550
You're one lousy kisser.

328
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:49.890
I seen you go in there
after that ball-buster.

329
01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:51.680
Here's the stuff from last night.

330
01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:55.140
We got 4 for the silverware,
6 for the typewriter.

331
01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:59.720
Lipschitz wouldn't cough up any
more. We gotta get somebody else.

332
01:13:01.650 --> 01:13:04.740
I came to divvy up.

333
01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:09.770
- Tomorrow, with the others.
- I also came to pick you up.

334
01:13:10.830 --> 01:13:15.040
- I can't come right now. -The
houses, the stores are all empty.

335
01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:19.170
We got our pick. You pick that.

336
01:13:19.170 --> 01:13:21.540
Yeah.

337
01:13:24.170 --> 01:13:29.080
Some partner I got. Have fun.

338
01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:36.810
How's it going, boys?

339
01:13:36.810 --> 01:13:39.350
Who's that?

340
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:41.720
Bugsy.

341
01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:02.210
I hear you guys are in business
for yourselves now.

342
01:14:02.210 --> 01:14:04.530
I hear youse are doing real good.

343
01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:15.000
Ain't you gonna introduce me
to your friend here?

344
01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:20.010
I'll introduce myself.

345
01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.800
Excuse the glove.

346
01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:38.150
Son of a bitch!

347
01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:27.460
That's my cut.

348
01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:31.630
You don't work for me,
you don't work for no one.

349
01:15:31.630 --> 01:15:33.880
I don't like bosses.

350
01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:37.790
You was better off
you stayed in the Bronx.

351
01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:44.050
It would have been better
for you too.

352
01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:30.310
- I'm gonna kill him
one of these days. NOODLES: Yeah?

353
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:35.180
Meantime it looks like
he's killed us.

354
01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:57.290
Deborah, open up the door.

355
01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:01.450
Deborah, open up the door.

356
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:04.580
Deborah.

357
01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:50.450
- That stuff, is it ready?
- We're loading it.

358
01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:26.920
Che cazzo succede down here?

359
01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:29.550
AI, we got the big boys
with us today.

360
01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:33.470
- They wanna work for us. -Doing what
Bugsy did. We want his job.

361
01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:34.810
Do you get that?

362
01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:40.550
We the best escorts
you ever gonna get.

363
01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:45.230
A fangulo a ma, escort
your mother's ass out of here.

364
01:18:45.230 --> 01:18:47.480
Okay. Let's go, Noodles.

365
01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:50.890
We'll peddle your invention
somewhere else.

366
01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.740
Hey, wait a minute.

367
01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:57.370
What invention?

368
01:18:57.370 --> 01:19:00.500
- You ship your stuff by the river,
right? -Sometimes.

369
01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:04.210
And when you get caught,
you throw the cases overboard.

370
01:19:04.210 --> 01:19:07.130
- You lose the whole shipment.
- So?

371
01:19:07.130 --> 01:19:10.010
For 10 percent,
we'll save it all for you.

372
01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:13.740
- What do you got, a submarine?
- We got salt.

373
01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:15.930
You got what?

374
01:19:15.930 --> 01:19:18.100
Me and the boys are rolling salts.

375
01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:20.980
We need 3 tons of salt per shipment.

376
01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:24.980
Get the fuck out of here.
Go back to school where you belong.

377
01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:27.610
What is it with all this salt?

378
01:19:27.610 --> 01:19:32.560
Hey, hey, we got salt
on our noodles. Show 'em.

379
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:47.070
This is full of salt.

380
01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.830
All right, come here.

381
01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:11.400
- So?
- Keep your shirt on.

382
01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:14.430
We gotta wait for the salt
to dissolve.

383
01:20:46.230 --> 01:20:49.550
- Well?
- Hey, what's wrong?

384
01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:57.360
Hey, look.

385
01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:59.110
Wow!

386
01:21:00.910 --> 01:21:02.650
Great!

387
01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:06.370
- Look at that!
- It's great.

388
01:21:06.370 --> 01:21:08.190
- Noodles.
- Look.

389
01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:13.360
- I see 'em! What did I say?
- Yeah.

390
01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:18.160
Yeah!

391
01:21:26.430 --> 01:21:31.470
- Hey, Noodles.
- Hooray. Hooray for us!

392
01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:36.630
We did it.

393
01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:39.270
Come here, Max.

394
01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:44.070
- We did it.
- No, Max, no!

395
01:21:47.410 --> 01:21:49.060
Max.

396
01:21:50.330 --> 01:21:52.150
Max.

397
01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:05.170
Max!

398
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:09.000
Max!

399
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:25.770
What would you do without me?

400
01:23:30.970 --> 01:23:32.670
There.

401
01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:39.060
From here on, we establish
the shared funds of the gang.

402
01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:42.190
They belong to all of us together
and to none of us alone.

403
01:23:42.190 --> 01:23:46.360
And we solemnly swear to put in
50 percent of everything we make.

404
01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.600
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

405
01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:51.430
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

406
01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:55.850
Agreed.

407
01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:00.280
I wanna take another peek.

408
01:24:38.410 --> 01:24:42.250
This goes to Fat Moe.
We don't tell him what it's for.

409
01:24:42.250 --> 01:24:45.790
And he gives it back
only when we're all together.

410
01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:47.410
Agreed?

411
01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:49.740
Agreed.

412
01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:55.040
Agreed.

413
01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:54.630
Bugsy's coming! Run!

414
01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:47.730
Noodles.

415
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:51.360
I slipped.

416
01:28:32.590 --> 01:28:35.170
Schmuck.

417
01:30:49.770 --> 01:30:51.760
Wanna go in?

418
01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:57.150
Yeah.

419
01:30:57.150 --> 01:30:58.930
You a relative?

420
01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:04.020
An uncle.

421
01:31:16.210 --> 01:31:17.960
It's open.

422
01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:33.190
"Erected to their everlasting memory
by their friend and brother...

423
01:34:33.190 --> 01:34:35.970
...David Aaronson, 1967."

424
01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:00.800
Hello. May I help you?

425
01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:05.180
- I was just looking.
- I'm the director of Riverdale.

426
01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:07.890
I've never seen a tomb like this.

427
01:35:07.890 --> 01:35:12.380
We like to call them "heavens",
we find it's more calming.

428
01:35:16.730 --> 01:35:19.490
Erected to their everlasting memory
by their friend and brother...

429
01:35:19.490 --> 01:35:22.450
David Aaronson, 1967.

430
01:35:22.450 --> 01:35:24.940
Is it a new building?

431
01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:31.480
Yes. Do you know Mr. Aaronson,
Mr...? Sorry.

432
01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:34.660
Mr. Williams.

433
01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:41.500
Mr. Williams. An interest like yours
is a compliment to our architects.

434
01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:44.420
After you.

435
01:36:12.210 --> 01:36:15.920
I think the beauty of the interior
equals that of the exterior.

436
01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:18.570
Don't you agree, Mr. Williams?

437
01:36:19.210 --> 01:36:22.010
We wanted to do
the style of the 30s,

438
01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:25.580
which is when our young friends
went away.

439
01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:36.980
Was it Mr. Aaronson's idea?

440
01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:40.840
Actually he left the whole thing
up to us.

441
01:36:41.570 --> 01:36:44.320
We had carte blanche.

442
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:47.490
All he suggested was
the inscription.

443
01:36:47.490 --> 01:36:51.650
"Your youngest and strongest
will fall by the sword."

444
01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:57.210
- What about the music?
- And the music.

445
01:36:57.210 --> 01:37:00.210
- That was exactly his suggestion?
- Yes.

446
01:37:00.210 --> 01:37:02.710
We received a tape.

447
01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:06.130
You seem to know him so well.

448
01:37:06.130 --> 01:37:10.050
I'd like to ask you to tell him
how much you like the "heaven",

449
01:37:10.050 --> 01:37:14.210
- when you see him.
Could you do that? -Sure.

450
01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:19.150
I've been away quite a long time
and I lost the address.

451
01:37:19.150 --> 01:37:21.230
Maybe you...

452
01:37:21.230 --> 01:37:24.600
You must have signed a bill
or something.

453
01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:29.430
The bank handled it.
A foreign bank.

454
01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:34.600
I wish I could be of more assistance
to you, Mr. Williams.

455
01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:40.360
Have you ever thought to build
your own heaven?

456
01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:16.940
Think about it.

457
01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:49.380
Can I take that for you, sir?

458
01:40:51.390 --> 01:40:53.840
Your limousine is waiting.

459
01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:05.610
Maxie.

460
01:41:17.170 --> 01:41:20.540
How are you, uncle?
You're looking good.

461
01:41:21.590 --> 01:41:23.790
You're looking a little better.

462
01:41:26.930 --> 01:41:31.290
Come on. Better get you
off the streets.

463
01:41:34.100 --> 01:41:37.730
- Some limousine.
- What are you talking, huh?

464
01:41:37.730 --> 01:41:42.440
We own the company now.
It's a good cover. It pays off too.

465
01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:46.730
My mother wrote me you was
in the body-snatching business.

466
01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:52.120
I appreciate everything you did
for my family.

467
01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:55.000
Forget it. It's your dough.

468
01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:59.170
It's all down in black and white
in the company books.

469
01:41:59.170 --> 01:42:02.090
You're the company.
You and Patsy and Cockeye.

470
01:42:02.090 --> 01:42:04.800
Gravediggers and partners.

471
01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:08.330
Hey, enough of this.
Business before pleasure.

472
01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:11.260
We got a rush job. Here.

473
01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:16.920
Come here. Look at this. Come here.

474
01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:22.510
Sudden death. Fucking tragedy, huh?

475
01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:27.440
- 26 years old.
- 26?

476
01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:32.950
- What a shame. -Great stiff.
She died of an overdose.

477
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:35.120
And I'm ready for another.

478
01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:39.030
Pump the life into her. You didn't
turn pansy in there, did you?

479
01:42:42.330 --> 01:42:44.200
There you go.

480
01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:51.210
Turning over in the grave.
They do it every time.

481
01:43:32.130 --> 01:43:35.040
Don't worry. A pansy he ain't.

482
01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:40.770
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, Noodles.

483
01:43:40.770 --> 01:43:42.890
Whoops. Sorry.

484
01:43:42.890 --> 01:43:45.770
Thanks. Good night.

485
01:43:45.770 --> 01:43:48.440
Hey, you want a little
pick-me-up?

486
01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:51.220
No, thanks. I've had mine.

487
01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:56.930
- Did you give her your all?
- What do you think? You bet.

488
01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:24.270
Wait till you see this place.

489
01:44:24.270 --> 01:44:26.140
It's over here.

490
01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:32.050
- Where we going?
- To a place that never closes.

491
01:44:32.570 --> 01:44:34.970
Whoops. Watch yourself.

492
01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:53.250
What's this?

493
01:44:53.250 --> 01:44:56.160
Our place.
We got the hottest spot in town.

494
01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:06.790
This is the real Fat Moe's.

495
01:45:07.770 --> 01:45:10.140
Get rid of that rag, will you?

496
01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:13.610
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.

497
01:45:13.610 --> 01:45:16.350
- You like it?
- Beautiful. Beautiful.

498
01:45:31.370 --> 01:45:33.570
Hey, give me that.

499
01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:41.800
- Noodles.
- Patsy, look.

500
01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:45.830
Come here, son of a bitch.
Come here!

501
01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:49.220
- You look fantastic.
- Wait a minute.

502
01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:51.000
How you doing?

503
01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.850
- Look how big you got.
- Me?

504
01:45:55.850 --> 01:45:58.310
Noodles. Oh, God.

505
01:45:58.730 --> 01:46:01.890
- Noodles!
- Number three coming through.

506
01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:09.660
Let's have a toast, for chrissakes!

507
01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:12.450
- You look like shit.
- I just got out of prison.

508
01:46:12.450 --> 01:46:15.080
- Nice guy.
- Hey, Noodles, get a load of this.

509
01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:16.980
Look.

510
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:20.920
Hey, scotch heating.

511
01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:23.330
Yeah, a buck a cup.

512
01:46:24.050 --> 01:46:25.680
- A buck a cup?
- Yeah.

513
01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:27.590
- How much it cost us?
- Costing us?

514
01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:30.640
- Yeah.
- A dime, including overhead.

515
01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:34.370
- Hey, Noodles.
- Fat Moe.

516
01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:41.930
You look terrific.

517
01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:49.620
- Look like you lost an ounce or two.
- You think I'll lose hemorrhoids.

518
01:46:49.620 --> 01:46:52.240
Can't recognize him
without an apron.

519
01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:54.570
- L'Chaim.
- L'Chaim.

520
01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:57.150
Welcome home.

521
01:47:00.710 --> 01:47:04.960
What kind of maître are you?
You don't even show a guy around.

522
01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:06.800
- Yeah.
- What's with you?

523
01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:10.880
- I didn't know. I'm sorry.
- You're some shtunks.

524
01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:14.180
- You don't come up and get me.
- He's the shtunk.

525
01:47:14.180 --> 01:47:16.850
He said you weren't out till
Monday.

526
01:47:16.850 --> 01:47:19.800
You get him the next time
he gets out.

527
01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:22.640
God forbid. God forbid.

528
01:47:26.780 --> 01:47:31.430
Whoa! Whoa!

529
01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:43.870
Come on, let's see
if you can guess who it is.

530
01:47:48.590 --> 01:47:53.290
Charlotte russe. With a little
too much whipped cream.

531
01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:56.120
Peggy.

532
01:47:59.930 --> 01:48:04.350
Hey, you watch it, now.
And my prices, they've gone up.

533
01:48:04.350 --> 01:48:10.030
I work in a high-class joint now.
And I get paid by the pound.

534
01:48:10.030 --> 01:48:14.770
My Peggy, she's worth every penny
of it too, my red-hot mama.

535
01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:18.480
Come on, come on.

536
01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:22.410
Timber!

537
01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:27.380
You've seen your old pals, now
I want you to meet some new ones.

538
01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:32.620
- I'll see you later.
- You gonna lay here all night?

539
01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:45.920
Cockeye wanted to play
with the band. I'm serious.

540
01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:54.060
Come on.

541
01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:24.620
- Aren't you going to say hello?
- Hello.

542
01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:48.480
- Your brother's a real friend.
- He's a romantic.

543
01:49:59.470 --> 01:50:04.100
- Max tell you I was getting out
today? -Max? No.

544
01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:09.080
- You remembered yourself?
- No, Moe. It's always Moe.

545
01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:15.270
Yeah.

546
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:26.200
You weren't counting the days?

547
01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:31.830
Of course I was.
4344, 4343.

548
01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:34.380
I lost track at 3000.

549
01:50:34.380 --> 01:50:38.110
- That wasn't my choice.
- Yes, it was. It still is.

550
01:50:41.050 --> 01:50:44.300
Did you come here
to welcome me back at least?

551
01:50:44.300 --> 01:50:48.960
I still live here. I was on my way
out. Moe said I should say hello.

552
01:50:50.010 --> 01:50:54.300
I hope Moe didn't have
to bend your arm or anything.

553
01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:57.970
No.

554
01:50:59.230 --> 01:51:01.680
Welcome back, Noodles.

555
01:51:04.450 --> 01:51:06.190
Hey, Noodles.

556
01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:15.080
You dancing?

557
01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:18.160
Every night at the Palace Theatre.

558
01:51:18.630 --> 01:51:22.800
I've made some progress since
I danced here among the brooms

559
01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:24.320
and the empties.

560
01:51:25.170 --> 01:51:29.790
You can come spy on me if you like.
If you have time.

561
01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:32.670
Every night.

562
01:51:48.610 --> 01:51:50.480
Noodles.

563
01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:57.690
Go on, Noodles,
your mother's calling you.

564
01:52:05.590 --> 01:52:08.620
It's good to see you again, Noodles.

565
01:52:21.150 --> 01:52:23.020
My pleasure.

566
01:52:31.530 --> 01:52:35.360
- Did you get the wine?
- Dago Red. The best.

567
01:52:42.670 --> 01:52:44.490
How you doing?

568
01:52:51.130 --> 01:52:55.240
There they are.
The four horsemen of the apocalypse.

569
01:52:57.470 --> 01:53:00.810
Did you see that movie, Joe?
It's a good movie.

570
01:53:00.810 --> 01:53:02.690
- Max, how are you?
- Good to see you.

571
01:53:02.690 --> 01:53:04.630
Nice to see you.

572
01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:08.570
- This must be Noodles.
- Noodles, say hello to Mr. Monaldi.

573
01:53:08.570 --> 01:53:10.860
- Hi, how are you?
- All right.

574
01:53:10.860 --> 01:53:15.360
Nice to meet you. You don't have
to call me Mr. Monaldi.

575
01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:20.190
I like my friends and people
I respect to call me Frankie.

576
01:53:20.620 --> 01:53:24.730
Come on, sit down.
Get some chairs and some glasses.

577
01:53:28.210 --> 01:53:32.120
Sit down, relax. You're home now.

578
01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:44.520
This is my very dear friend Joe.

579
01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:48.480
He came from Detroit to ask me
to do him a favor.

580
01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:50.760
And I wanna do it for him.

581
01:53:51.690 --> 01:53:55.490
I don't have to tell you who Joe is,
how far he got,

582
01:53:55.490 --> 01:53:57.950
or how far he'll get.

583
01:53:57.950 --> 01:54:01.830
He's not only my dear friend,
he's my brother.

584
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:06.060
I'll tell you the truth.
Even a Jew can't eat this shit.

585
01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:09.620
I mean, the mustard
doesn't even help.

586
01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:22.300
These guys with you?

587
01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:25.510
I told you these fellas are with me.

588
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:28.810
You could trust them.
You're in good hands.

589
01:54:28.810 --> 01:54:32.090
Just tell them
what you want them to do.

590
01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:38.180
Move some diamonds from Detroit.
Kid stuff.

591
01:54:43.070 --> 01:54:45.620
Why us then?

592
01:54:45.620 --> 01:54:50.030
If it's kid stuff, why not have
the kids from Detroit do it?

593
01:54:52.290 --> 01:54:58.210
Excuse me, Noodles. He means that
it's something that's very simple.

594
01:54:58.210 --> 01:55:01.720
But he needs kids
from outside to handle it.

595
01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:05.140
He just found out they're moving
these diamonds to Holland

596
01:55:05.140 --> 01:55:09.040
in a few days. So it's something
came up right away.

597
01:55:09.890 --> 01:55:12.050
You understand?

598
01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:20.100
Hey, Joe.

599
01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:27.160
Tell these guys the story about
the pussy being insured. What is it?

600
01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:29.330
Insured?

601
01:55:29.330 --> 01:55:32.910
Tell these guys how you
stumbled on this whole thing.

602
01:55:32.910 --> 01:55:35.170
- Tell them the story.
- Come on.

603
01:55:35.170 --> 01:55:39.090
Pussy insurance. The insurance
pussies. Tell them that story.

604
01:55:39.090 --> 01:55:45.220
Life is stranger than shit, that's
all. It's a pisser. No big story.

605
01:55:45.220 --> 01:55:48.850
I got this insurance agent,
this Jew kid named David.

606
01:55:48.850 --> 01:55:53.680
He conned me into every policy
in the world. Every policy, name it.

607
01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:57.610
Dogs, house, wife, life, anything.

608
01:55:57.610 --> 01:56:02.530
I'm drinking with the boys one
night, he comes in with his wife...

609
01:56:02.530 --> 01:56:05.200
...a brunette with a nice ass
who works for a jeweler.

610
01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:08.440
And he's still on the hustle,
this guy.

611
01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:12.320
So I wink at the guys,
I say, "Look...

612
01:56:13.620 --> 01:56:18.080
...the most serious policy,
you don't have me covered for."

613
01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:22.300
He goes, "What's that, Joe?"
"Cock insurance."

614
01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:27.130
"You make me a policy that when
it don't work, I get a payment...

615
01:56:27.130 --> 01:56:29.710
...I'll write out a check now."

616
01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:35.600
He thinks, and he says,
"I don't know if the actuality

617
01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:39.770
gauges govern this...
but we can make a policy.

618
01:56:39.770 --> 01:56:43.150
But you gotta guarantee
you're in good health now."

619
01:56:43.150 --> 01:56:48.070
I says, "Look, leave her with me.
Come back and see if it stands up.

620
01:56:48.070 --> 01:56:51.410
If it stands up,
you know I'm in good health."

621
01:56:51.410 --> 01:56:53.620
The jerk leaves her. I screw her.

622
01:56:53.620 --> 01:56:57.500
Not only that, she likes it.
And she tells me when her boss,

623
01:56:57.500 --> 01:57:00.960
the jeweler...
is shipping stones to Holland...

624
01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:05.420
...where he keeps his stash
in a drawer in the safe. Everything.

625
01:57:05.420 --> 01:57:08.920
Can't ask for more, right?
Except, one better.

626
01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:13.500
I never paid the first premium
on the new cock policy.

627
01:57:26.770 --> 01:57:29.050
Cock insurance.

628
01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:38.620
Life is funnier than shit.

629
01:57:38.620 --> 01:57:40.240
But...

630
01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:46.700
...be easy with the girl.

631
01:57:49.630 --> 01:57:52.450
I mean that. Be easy with the girl.

632
01:58:00.100 --> 01:58:02.000
Oh, my God!

633
01:58:08.150 --> 01:58:09.480
Open it!

634
01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:12.140
Who's gotten in?

635
01:58:19.870 --> 01:58:22.190
Had to go and be a hero, huh?

636
01:58:28.170 --> 01:58:30.090
- Open it.
- No.

637
01:58:30.090 --> 01:58:33.010
- Open it!
- No, don't hurt him!

638
01:58:33.010 --> 01:58:36.130
- Don't hurt him!
- Get this bitch out of here.

639
01:58:36.130 --> 01:58:39.510
You animal! You asshole!

640
01:58:40.050 --> 01:58:42.890
- Come on, hit me.
- What do you mean?

641
01:58:42.890 --> 01:58:45.390
- Hit me.
- What, are you crazy?

642
01:58:45.390 --> 01:58:47.980
- Straighten up and fly right.
- I'm all right.

643
01:58:47.980 --> 01:58:51.560
Let me make it look real.
Make it look real.

644
01:58:51.560 --> 01:58:53.860
- Knock it off.
- I'm all right. Let go.

645
01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:56.480
- Come on, cut the act.
- Hit me!

646
01:58:56.480 --> 01:59:00.530
She said hit her.
Go ahead, rap her in the mouth.

647
01:59:00.530 --> 01:59:03.730
- Hit me!
- I'll hit you! You bitch!

648
01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:08.990
- You animal!
- Put a cork in her.

649
01:59:13.670 --> 01:59:14.960
No.

650
01:59:14.960 --> 01:59:17.210
No. Don't.

651
01:59:17.210 --> 01:59:20.050
Don't. No!

652
01:59:20.050 --> 01:59:26.390
No! You dirty bastards!

653
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:32.640
Bastards!

654
01:59:38.990 --> 01:59:41.140
Try the secret compartment.

655
01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:49.490
Attaboy.

656
01:59:58.760 --> 02:00:00.500
Thanks.

657
02:00:24.150 --> 02:00:26.600
Nice matzo balls.

658
02:00:32.660 --> 02:00:35.610
Beautiful. Look at that.

659
02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:39.700
Okay, better wrap them up.

660
02:00:48.390 --> 02:00:51.210
We're going. You coming?

661
02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:55.500
Coming.

662
02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:46.260
- Morning.
- You get the stones?

663
02:02:07.090 --> 02:02:09.580
Pay him.

664
02:02:33.610 --> 02:02:37.400
- Any trouble?
- No trouble. Kid stuff.

665
02:05:32.750 --> 02:05:36.830
- How come you didn't tell me?
- Being inside can change you.

666
02:05:36.830 --> 02:05:39.880
I'd already made the deal
with Frankie to get rid of Joe.

667
02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:44.130
With Frankie Monaldi
you don't say, "yes" and then, "no."

668
02:05:44.130 --> 02:05:46.470
You're right.
I would have said, no.

669
02:05:46.470 --> 02:05:48.640
Frankie is as big as they come.

670
02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:50.850
He's got the combination
in his hand.

671
02:05:50.850 --> 02:05:53.850
If we're not careful,
he'll have us in his hand.

672
02:05:53.850 --> 02:05:56.640
You don't get nowhere alone.

673
02:05:56.640 --> 02:05:59.150
I thought you didn't like bosses.

674
02:05:59.150 --> 02:06:02.480
It sounded like a good idea then.
It still is.

675
02:06:02.480 --> 02:06:03.820
Think about it.

676
02:06:03.820 --> 02:06:08.770
They're gonna ask us to come in with
them. There's a lot in it for us.

677
02:06:10.780 --> 02:06:12.620
Today they asked us to get rid
of Joe.

678
02:06:12.620 --> 02:06:15.450
Tomorrow they ask me
to get rid of you.

679
02:06:15.450 --> 02:06:19.240
Is that okay with you?
'Cause it's not okay with me.

680
02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:24.080
All right.

681
02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:27.830
Let's just forget about it.

682
02:06:40.270 --> 02:06:42.220
Wanna go for a swim?

683
02:06:44.190 --> 02:06:47.010
Yeah, let's go for a swim.

684
02:06:57.740 --> 02:06:59.910
All right, what are you doing?

685
02:06:59.910 --> 02:07:03.740
Hey, Noodles.
Don't fuck around, Noodles.

686
02:07:06.420 --> 02:07:09.010
- Noodles, what are you doing?
- Hey!

687
02:07:09.010 --> 02:07:11.660
You crazy?

688
02:07:14.050 --> 02:07:16.380
Shit.

689
02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:26.640
Asshole!
Can't believe you did this!

690
02:10:50.220 --> 02:10:53.510
"District Attorney James Lister
was killed in an explosion of a car

691
02:10:53.510 --> 02:10:56.600
belonging to Secretary of Commerce
Bailey

692
02:10:56.600 --> 02:11:00.230
as he left the secretary's estate.

693
02:11:00.230 --> 02:11:03.820
Mr. Lister, killed in the blast,
was scheduled to testify

694
02:11:03.820 --> 02:11:07.150
in Washington on Thursday
before a Senate committee.

695
02:11:07.150 --> 02:11:11.320
A committee investigating what has
been called "The Bailey Scandal."

696
02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:14.870
A team of detectives
has been assigned to the case.

697
02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:20.110
Secretary Bailey was not available
for any statement at this time."

698
02:11:20.580 --> 02:11:21.880
Did you know them?

699
02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:25.380
"...offices of his legal advisor,
Irving Gold...

700
02:11:25.380 --> 02:11:28.090
...in hopes of getting some comment.

701
02:11:28.090 --> 02:11:33.300
Mr. Gold, you're aware
that District Attorney Lister

702
02:11:33.300 --> 02:11:36.760
is the second witness in the
Bailey Scandal to meet a sudden end.

703
02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:40.440
The first was Thomas Finney,
undersecretary of commerce

704
02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:44.810
who fell to his death from his
15th-floor office a month ago."

705
02:11:44.810 --> 02:11:46.320
Is there a connection...?

706
02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:50.430
Take the money and run, Noodles.
What's keeping you here?

707
02:11:51.570 --> 02:11:54.570
"The only remaining witness
is the man who

708
02:11:54.570 --> 02:11:57.700
rightly or wrongly has given
his name to this affair,

709
02:11:57.700 --> 02:11:59.870
Secretary Bailey."

710
02:11:59.870 --> 02:12:02.150
Curious.

711
02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:06.170
"The secretary has no worries.
If he has no worries,

712
02:12:06.170 --> 02:12:09.960
why has he retreated to his place
on Long Island?

713
02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:13.720
He's preparing his attack
on the questions

714
02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:15.890
he will be asked
by the committee.

715
02:12:15.890 --> 02:12:18.600
I'd call them accusations
more than questions.

716
02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:21.430
- He has no worries.
- The public does.

717
02:12:21.430 --> 02:12:24.730
Particularly, in view of the rumors
about rigged contracts,

718
02:12:24.730 --> 02:12:27.600
bribery, the international Mafia.

719
02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:30.610
Especially those dealing
with the illegal use

720
02:12:30.610 --> 02:12:33.820
of the Transport union
pension funds.

721
02:12:33.820 --> 02:12:36.320
Could you tell us anything
about that?

722
02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:39.080
Gentlemen,
I deny all of these rumors

723
02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:42.330
and allegations
against my organization.

724
02:12:42.330 --> 02:12:46.960
Our hands have always been
and will continue to remain clean.

725
02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:52.670
In my entire life, I've fought to
keep the American labor movement..."

726
02:12:52.670 --> 02:12:53.880
Him, I know.

727
02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:57.090
"...forced speculation,
criminal elements

728
02:12:57.090 --> 02:13:01.850
or corrupt politicians.
If any mistakes have..."

729
02:13:01.850 --> 02:13:05.140
He's still giving out
the same old bullshit.

730
02:13:05.140 --> 02:13:11.880
"If any guilt at all exists in this
situation, it lies elsewhere."

731
02:13:50.650 --> 02:13:55.300
What's this I've been reading
about you in the newspapers?

732
02:13:57.270 --> 02:14:02.230
Inflammatory words
from a union boss?

733
02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:12.000
You still won't come and stop
the workers or the social movement.

734
02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:15.420
Listen to me, you socialist asshole!

735
02:14:15.420 --> 02:14:18.880
We don't give a good fart
about the socialist workers

736
02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:20.920
and their movements.

737
02:14:20.920 --> 02:14:26.090
We want you out of the factory so we
can get the furnaces working again.

738
02:14:26.090 --> 02:14:29.270
This is the last offer
you're gonna get.

739
02:14:29.270 --> 02:14:32.720
You want to sign it or what?

740
02:14:38.190 --> 02:14:41.900
Tell your bosses they can wipe
their ass with it.

741
02:14:47.870 --> 02:14:49.610
Fill her up.

742
02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:16.420
This is my last...

743
02:15:23.190 --> 02:15:26.720
Hold it, boys. Don't shoot.

744
02:15:27.530 --> 02:15:30.230
It's me, Crowning.

745
02:15:42.750 --> 02:15:45.670
- Crowning.
- Yeah.

746
02:15:45.670 --> 02:15:47.510
That'll do, boys.

747
02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:49.510
What'll do?

748
02:15:49.510 --> 02:15:53.210
We almost got the kid
where we want him.

749
02:15:56.640 --> 02:15:59.890
And we got the boss
where we want him.

750
02:15:59.890 --> 02:16:01.890
Easy.

751
02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:04.930
Easy.

752
02:16:07.860 --> 02:16:10.950
Put 'em down.

753
02:16:10.950 --> 02:16:13.940
Put your guns away, boys.

754
02:16:23.330 --> 02:16:26.040
Just swapping prisoners.

755
02:16:26.040 --> 02:16:29.080
Fair trade,
huh, chickenhead?

756
02:16:36.060 --> 02:16:39.390
Union boy over here
for Mr. Boss Man.

757
02:16:39.390 --> 02:16:42.690
Well, look who's here.

758
02:16:42.690 --> 02:16:45.600
Fat Moe's boneyard boys.

759
02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:48.110
Which reminds me.

760
02:16:48.110 --> 02:16:52.270
How's that cancer in your gut
coming along, Chicken Joe?

761
02:16:53.950 --> 02:16:57.990
- Untie him.
- I don't take orders from you.

762
02:16:57.990 --> 02:17:01.330
We're not asking you to take orders.
We're telling you.

763
02:17:01.330 --> 02:17:03.670
Now go ahead, untie him.

764
02:17:03.670 --> 02:17:06.070
Untie him.

765
02:17:10.550 --> 02:17:12.070
Untie him.

766
02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:45.360
Who are you?

767
02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:47.400
Who's paying you?

768
02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:51.250
I think this is gonna piss you off,
Mac.

769
02:17:51.250 --> 02:17:54.960
I think it's those dirty
politician friends of yours.

770
02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:59.760
Yeah? Well, you crawl back and tell
'em we don't want you in with us.

771
02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:03.850
Our fight's got nothing to do with
liquor and prostitution and dope.

772
02:18:03.850 --> 02:18:07.100
Well, you'd better
get used to the idea, pal.

773
02:18:07.100 --> 02:18:09.310
This country is still growing up.

774
02:18:09.310 --> 02:18:13.640
Certain diseases it's better
to have when you're still young.

775
02:18:15.030 --> 02:18:19.990
You boys ain't a mild case
of the measles. You're the plague.

776
02:18:19.990 --> 02:18:22.200
Bastards like him are immune.

777
02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:25.900
That's the difference
between us and them!

778
02:18:27.330 --> 02:18:29.330
Take it easy.

779
02:18:29.330 --> 02:18:31.500
The difference is,
they'll always win.

780
02:18:31.500 --> 02:18:34.250
And you'll keep
getting it up the ass.

781
02:18:34.250 --> 02:18:36.620
Sooner than you think.

782
02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:57.900
Chief Aiello, moving policemen
into the factory came as a surprise.

783
02:18:57.900 --> 02:19:00.780
The press, the unions,
especially the strikers.

784
02:19:00.780 --> 02:19:03.530
What did you want,
a declaration of war?

785
02:19:03.530 --> 02:19:05.450
Ours was a peaceable operation.

786
02:19:05.450 --> 02:19:07.990
Wasn't that contrary
to new union laws?

787
02:19:07.990 --> 02:19:10.370
I'm chief of police,
not chief of people.

788
02:19:10.370 --> 02:19:12.870
Was there any violence to justify...

789
02:19:12.870 --> 02:19:16.710
My motto is:
"Prevention, not repression."

790
02:19:16.710 --> 02:19:18.960
You let scabs move in and work.

791
02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:23.010
Young lady, you wanna talk to me,
call them "unemployed workers."

792
02:19:23.010 --> 02:19:24.590
With your permission,

793
02:19:24.590 --> 02:19:28.720
I'll take these flowers
to my missis before they wilt.

794
02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:33.680
Or maybe you heard.
I'm the father of a baby boy.

795
02:19:34.890 --> 02:19:37.560
Chief, one more question.

796
02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:39.570
We heard he's the youngest
stockholder

797
02:19:39.570 --> 02:19:42.440
in that factory you occupied.

798
02:19:46.740 --> 02:19:48.870
What'd you mean by that?

799
02:19:48.870 --> 02:19:53.820
They say management expressed their
thanks with a present for the baby.

800
02:19:56.460 --> 02:19:59.250
You know,
slander is a serious offense.

801
02:19:59.250 --> 02:20:02.000
Especially from a hack reporter.

802
02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:05.160
You wanna find out how serious?

803
02:20:06.880 --> 02:20:12.060
But since this is my first boy
after four girls...

804
02:20:12.060 --> 02:20:15.010
...I'll declare amnesty.

805
02:20:16.270 --> 02:20:19.010
Behave yourself.

806
02:20:19.980 --> 02:20:22.300
Go.

807
02:22:33.110 --> 02:22:35.680
Thank you.

808
02:22:36.280 --> 02:22:38.030
- He's eating?
- Mmm.

809
02:22:38.030 --> 02:22:41.620
- For five.
- For five? Well, why not.

810
02:22:41.620 --> 02:22:44.580
You could feed an army
with these milk plants.

811
02:22:44.580 --> 02:22:47.480
We could open up a dairy.

812
02:22:49.290 --> 02:22:52.630
Oh, hey. Che bella.

813
02:22:52.630 --> 02:22:58.590
Who loves you? Who loves you?
I love you.

814
02:22:58.590 --> 02:23:02.600
And I love you.
And I love you.

815
02:23:02.600 --> 02:23:04.390
Lucy!

816
02:23:04.390 --> 02:23:06.840
- Don't you have to feed him at 6:00?
- Uh-huh.

817
02:23:07.810 --> 02:23:09.630
Come in.

818
02:23:10.940 --> 02:23:14.690
- Oh, here he is now.
- That's my son.

819
02:23:14.690 --> 02:23:17.190
That's my son.

820
02:23:20.820 --> 02:23:25.610
That's my son! That's my son!

821
02:23:26.620 --> 02:23:29.910
Jesus Christ, they change fast.

822
02:23:29.910 --> 02:23:32.750
Yeah, but he looks like my old man.

823
02:23:32.750 --> 02:23:34.790
Yeah, yeah, look, same eyes.

824
02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:37.340
And look, the same devilish pride.

825
02:23:37.340 --> 02:23:40.380
Hey. Hey, hey.

826
02:23:40.380 --> 02:23:42.090
Did you see his dickey?

827
02:23:42.090 --> 02:23:44.220
- Vincent.
- What?

828
02:23:44.220 --> 02:23:46.640
- The girls.
- The girls!

829
02:23:46.640 --> 02:23:49.270
Sooner or later
you have to learn that after me,

830
02:23:49.270 --> 02:23:52.730
the boss in the house is him.

831
02:23:52.730 --> 02:23:54.690
He's got balls like his papa.

832
02:23:54.690 --> 02:23:56.110
- Hey!
- Let me have him.

833
02:23:56.110 --> 02:24:01.570
No, no, no.
I'll do this. I'll do this, huh.

834
02:24:01.570 --> 02:24:05.120
Hey. No, no, no.

835
02:24:05.120 --> 02:24:08.020
Look. Hey, hey.

836
02:24:11.790 --> 02:24:13.290
Let Papa change you.

837
02:24:13.290 --> 02:24:15.670
Come on,
everything will be swell.

838
02:24:15.670 --> 02:24:20.950
Come on, come on, come on.

839
02:24:21.760 --> 02:24:23.930
What the fuck is this?

840
02:24:23.930 --> 02:24:30.010
- What is this? Huh? What's that?
- Oh, no!

841
02:24:30.010 --> 02:24:32.430
- Look!
- It's the right number.

842
02:24:32.430 --> 02:24:35.940
The right number?
I'll break your goddamn neck!

843
02:24:35.940 --> 02:24:38.720
Find my son,
or I'll burn down this building.

844
02:24:41.230 --> 02:24:43.860
Hello.
Would you shut up?

845
02:24:43.860 --> 02:24:48.370
No, hey, no. Wait, wait.
I'm not talking to you.

846
02:24:48.370 --> 02:24:50.740
Well, who's this?

847
02:24:50.740 --> 02:24:53.330
Never mind.
To who am I talking?

848
02:24:53.330 --> 02:24:56.290
Where the hell are you?
My son, where is he?

849
02:24:56.290 --> 02:25:00.500
Where do you think? He's in the
maternity ward. He never left.

850
02:25:00.500 --> 02:25:04.010
He got restless, so he wanted
to change his bed.

851
02:25:04.010 --> 02:25:07.880
The other kids got the same idea,
so they wanted to change their beds.

852
02:25:07.880 --> 02:25:11.850
You got 30, 40 screaming babies
jumping from one bed to another

853
02:25:11.850 --> 02:25:15.430
switching tags,
so now we do have a real problem.

854
02:25:15.430 --> 02:25:20.060
Piece of shit whoever you are!
What the fuck! I want my son!

855
02:25:20.060 --> 02:25:24.480
Luckily, we were there to see
that everything was under control.

856
02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:26.990
If you want,
we can put everything back.

857
02:25:26.990 --> 02:25:31.200
- Except you gotta meet us halfway.
- Tell me!

858
02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:33.660
Why do you give a fuck
who wins the strike?

859
02:25:33.660 --> 02:25:36.290
That's got nothing to do
with me! What did I do?

860
02:25:36.290 --> 02:25:38.830
First of all, you let the scabs in.

861
02:25:38.830 --> 02:25:42.170
Second, you've got the cops in there
protecting them.

862
02:25:42.170 --> 02:25:45.050
- I'm a cop!
- All right, shut the fuck up!

863
02:25:45.050 --> 02:25:47.220
Now listen very carefully.

864
02:25:47.220 --> 02:25:50.220
Call off your dogs
and let the strikers work it out

865
02:25:50.220 --> 02:25:52.590
- with the bosses.
- I want my son!

866
02:25:52.590 --> 02:25:54.850
Do that and
we'll give you the kid's number.

867
02:25:54.850 --> 02:25:58.850
If you don't, look for your
kid yourself. And good luck.

868
02:25:58.850 --> 02:26:01.270
- So, what is it gonna be?
- Okay.

869
02:26:01.270 --> 02:26:04.360
- I'll call my men off today.
- Attaboy.

870
02:26:04.360 --> 02:26:07.690
You know, for a rotten bastard
son of a bitch

871
02:26:07.690 --> 02:26:10.850
you're not as stupid as I thought.

872
02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:13.990
- We'll be in touch.
- When will you call?

873
02:26:13.990 --> 02:26:17.240
Don't worry, don't worry.
We'll be in touch with you.

874
02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:18.690
- Bye.
- I got to...

875
02:26:22.330 --> 02:26:25.530
- So?
- We got a deal.

876
02:26:29.050 --> 02:26:31.470
- To a very smooth talker.
- Yeah.

877
02:26:31.470 --> 02:26:34.430
- Mazel.
- At least.

878
02:26:34.430 --> 02:26:36.420
Peggeleh.

879
02:26:41.930 --> 02:26:44.140
Where's that switch list?

880
02:26:44.140 --> 02:26:46.970
- The switch list?
- Yeah.

881
02:26:47.900 --> 02:26:49.780
- I can't find it.
- What?

882
02:26:49.780 --> 02:26:52.270
I can't find it.

883
02:26:52.820 --> 02:26:56.030
- What'd you do with it?
- I think I dumped it.

884
02:26:56.030 --> 02:26:57.780
What a yutz.

885
02:26:57.780 --> 02:27:00.120
- Oh, Pat.
- Wait a minute, listen.

886
02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:03.120
Listen, Noodles,
Noodles, wait. I remember.

887
02:27:03.120 --> 02:27:07.210
The boys' numbers was odd...
Even, and the girls' was odd.

888
02:27:07.210 --> 02:27:09.500
- It's simple.
- You took good stock.

889
02:27:09.500 --> 02:27:11.960
Hey, let's give him an even number.

890
02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:14.510
Eight. Let's pick an eight.

891
02:27:14.510 --> 02:27:16.030
Eight.

892
02:27:18.510 --> 02:27:24.060
- Yeah, it's a good number. -Wait.
What about the other pischers?

893
02:27:24.060 --> 02:27:26.440
We're better than fate.

894
02:27:26.440 --> 02:27:29.590
We give some the good life,
give it to others up the ass.

895
02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:35.990
All right, boys, let's settle up.
It's Saturday.

896
02:27:35.990 --> 02:27:39.530
Settle-shmettle,
I'm gonna take mine out in trade.

897
02:27:39.530 --> 02:27:41.230
You're such a nudge.

898
02:27:42.490 --> 02:27:46.830
You know what? I wish
I was switched when I was a kid.

899
02:27:46.830 --> 02:27:49.610
What makes you think you weren't?

900
02:28:04.390 --> 02:28:07.390
I don't believe it.

901
02:28:07.390 --> 02:28:11.440
Hey, you guys, come here.
Take a look at who's over here.

902
02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:13.900
- That suit you, Peg?
- Fine, Max.

903
02:28:13.900 --> 02:28:16.850
- What've you got?
- Over there.

904
02:28:18.900 --> 02:28:21.230
Well, what...

905
02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:30.410
Holy shit! Noodles! Noodles!
Come here, come here.

906
02:28:30.410 --> 02:28:32.490
Look.

907
02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:36.910
The blond by the piano.

908
02:28:40.170 --> 02:28:42.260
- Who's that?
- Who is that?

909
02:28:42.260 --> 02:28:46.090
You and this broad were practically
engaged at one point.

910
02:28:46.720 --> 02:28:51.060
Oh, beat me. Oh, I love it.

911
02:28:51.060 --> 02:28:53.730
- Who was it?
The Detroit cock-squasher? -Yeah.

912
02:28:53.730 --> 02:28:56.270
- Peggy.
- No, she looks different.

913
02:28:56.270 --> 02:28:59.780
You know that platinum blond.
She's by the table.

914
02:28:59.780 --> 02:29:02.600
See her? Call her in, will you?

915
02:29:08.830 --> 02:29:10.450
- Carol.
- Carol, whatever.

916
02:29:10.450 --> 02:29:14.860
Just tell her there's a bunch
of her old friends here.

917
02:29:16.170 --> 02:29:17.920
Carol.

918
02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:20.200
Carol!

919
02:29:24.800 --> 02:29:27.580
Noodles, come here.

920
02:29:30.390 --> 02:29:34.220
- Somebody here wants to see you.
- Who?

921
02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:37.090
You know these guys?

922
02:29:38.690 --> 02:29:40.970
No.

923
02:29:41.980 --> 02:29:44.850
I don't think so.

924
02:29:48.280 --> 02:29:49.950
No.

925
02:29:49.950 --> 02:29:54.150
No. I'd remember a bunch
of good-lookers like these.

926
02:30:11.260 --> 02:30:15.340
Oh, well,
how could I forget.

927
02:30:21.190 --> 02:30:23.730
There was...

928
02:30:23.730 --> 02:30:29.770
There was only one of you
I got to know personally, though.

929
02:30:31.120 --> 02:30:32.990
Which one?

930
02:30:32.990 --> 02:30:36.650
Let's see how good a memory
you've got for faces.

931
02:30:56.560 --> 02:30:59.140
You.

932
02:30:59.140 --> 02:31:01.310
No.

933
02:31:01.310 --> 02:31:02.730
Him.

934
02:31:02.730 --> 02:31:08.090
We've been hanging out so
long we're starting to look alike.

935
02:31:18.700 --> 02:31:21.730
Charmed.

936
02:31:38.560 --> 02:31:40.960
You can call me Carol.

937
02:31:52.070 --> 02:31:54.720
We've already met.

938
02:32:12.550 --> 02:32:15.040
Pleasure.

939
02:32:15.670 --> 02:32:17.970
The pleasure...

940
02:32:17.970 --> 02:32:20.620
...is all mine.

941
02:32:30.350 --> 02:32:33.480
Mmm.

942
02:32:47.200 --> 02:32:50.250
So you left Detroit, huh?

943
02:32:50.250 --> 02:32:53.170
Her and her husband
just come in on weekends.

944
02:32:53.170 --> 02:32:55.570
Yeah, beats the seashore.

945
02:32:56.130 --> 02:33:00.390
She takes on 10 guys while her hubby
watches through the peephole.

946
02:33:00.390 --> 02:33:02.680
Beats the hell out of the movies.

947
02:33:02.680 --> 02:33:05.470
I wonder what that jerk
is up to in his cubbyhole?

948
02:33:05.470 --> 02:33:09.080
He must be wondering
where is his fucking wife.

949
02:33:15.810 --> 02:33:19.780
Why don't we make it a threesome,
huh?

950
02:33:19.780 --> 02:33:23.070
Can't you see he's got
other plans for tonight?

951
02:33:23.070 --> 02:33:27.560
Well, bring her along.
We'll make it a foursome.

952
02:33:31.460 --> 02:33:34.790
I'm not that kind of guy.

953
02:33:34.790 --> 02:33:37.290
I'm afraid if I give you
a good crack in the mouth,

954
02:33:37.290 --> 02:33:40.040
you'd probably like it.

955
02:33:53.020 --> 02:33:56.100
Have a good night, fellas.

956
02:33:56.100 --> 02:33:58.470
See you later.

957
02:34:04.570 --> 02:34:07.950
They make you dress like those
lunatics who go around Germany

958
02:34:07.950 --> 02:34:10.580
burning down all Jewish stores.

959
02:34:10.580 --> 02:34:14.610
Those lunatics burned down also
our store and made us go to America.

960
02:34:16.210 --> 02:34:19.090
- I'm Jewish too.
- I know, sir.

961
02:34:19.090 --> 02:34:22.570
- Everybody knows.
- Knows what?

962
02:34:24.130 --> 02:34:26.630
Everybody knows who you are, sir.

963
02:34:30.550 --> 02:34:34.930
- And what do you think? -I don't
think, it's your business, sir.

964
02:34:34.930 --> 02:34:36.960
No, you think.

965
02:34:38.060 --> 02:34:41.060
You think it's a disgrace,
don't you?

966
02:34:41.060 --> 02:34:43.610
We don't have to be
like the Italians,

967
02:34:43.610 --> 02:34:46.530
who look up to the lawbreakers.

968
02:34:46.530 --> 02:34:50.310
We have enough enemies
without becoming gangsters, sir.

969
02:34:50.910 --> 02:34:53.740
How much money do you make a week?

970
02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:56.040
Not everybody tips like you, sir.

971
02:34:56.040 --> 02:34:59.120
I make enough to go to school
and learn for my degree.

972
02:34:59.120 --> 02:35:02.540
Good for you. So maybe by the time
you are 60, you'll make enough,

973
02:35:02.540 --> 02:35:06.330
but then you won't be able
to get it up anymore.

974
02:35:20.730 --> 02:35:23.630
- Been waiting long?
- All my life.

975
02:35:44.130 --> 02:35:46.960
You wanted a place by the ocean.
I had it opened.

976
02:35:46.960 --> 02:35:48.800
It was closed for the season.

977
02:35:48.800 --> 02:35:51.930
All these tables are for two people.

978
02:35:51.930 --> 02:35:54.800
Pick whatever one you want.

979
02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:27.710
I like this one.

980
02:36:27.710 --> 02:36:30.240
Here, sit down.

981
02:36:36.590 --> 02:36:39.300
Boeuf à la mode.
Blanquette de veau.

982
02:36:39.300 --> 02:36:41.560
I'll have the asperges sauce
vinaigrette

983
02:36:41.560 --> 02:36:43.100
and then a Châteaubriand.

984
02:36:43.100 --> 02:36:45.310
- Pommes frites?
- Natures.

985
02:36:45.310 --> 02:36:48.440
- Comme dessert?
- I'll decide later.

986
02:36:48.440 --> 02:36:51.430
- Monsieur?
- I'll have the same.

987
02:36:52.110 --> 02:36:54.110
For the wine?

988
02:36:54.110 --> 02:36:56.530
You decide.
I'll just have water.

989
02:36:56.530 --> 02:37:00.890
- You decide.
- Thank you.

990
02:37:07.790 --> 02:37:09.660
You've been around.

991
02:37:10.420 --> 02:37:13.920
Where'd you learn them
parlez-vous français dishes?

992
02:37:13.920 --> 02:37:16.800
Who's teaching you that stuff?

993
02:37:16.800 --> 02:37:20.450
You mean a sugar daddy,
who tries to teach me how to act?

994
02:37:22.470 --> 02:37:25.350
I read books.
I want to know everything.

995
02:37:25.350 --> 02:37:28.250
Doesn't it make sense to have plans?

996
02:37:29.180 --> 02:37:31.940
Yeah, it does.

997
02:37:31.940 --> 02:37:35.550
What about me?
Am I in any of these plans?

998
02:37:37.070 --> 02:37:39.390
Noodles...

999
02:37:40.410 --> 02:37:44.120
You're the only person
that I have ever...

1000
02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:47.690
Ever what? Go ahead.

1001
02:37:48.710 --> 02:37:51.290
Ever what?

1002
02:37:51.290 --> 02:37:54.210
That I ever cared about.

1003
02:37:54.210 --> 02:37:58.290
But you'd lock me up and
throw away the key, wouldn't you?

1004
02:38:02.380 --> 02:38:05.010
Yeah.

1005
02:38:05.010 --> 02:38:07.140
Yeah, I guess so.

1006
02:38:07.140 --> 02:38:09.430
Yeah...

1007
02:38:09.430 --> 02:38:13.140
And the thing is,
I probably wouldn't even mind.

1008
02:38:15.060 --> 02:38:20.070
- So?
- So I got to get to where I'm going.

1009
02:38:20.070 --> 02:38:23.270
- And where's that?
- To the top.

1010
02:38:26.570 --> 02:38:29.870
Now you sound just like Maxie.

1011
02:38:29.870 --> 02:38:33.420
Youse both alike,
that's why you hate each other.

1012
02:38:33.420 --> 02:38:36.040
Do you want me to leave?

1013
02:38:40.670 --> 02:38:43.620
No, I don't want you to leave.

1014
02:39:05.950 --> 02:39:08.700
You dancing?

1015
02:39:08.700 --> 02:39:10.490
- You asking?
- I'm asking.

1016
02:39:10.490 --> 02:39:12.990
I'm dancing.

1017
02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:30.240
To keep from going crazy, you have
to cut yourself off from the world.

1018
02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:32.240
Just not think about it.

1019
02:40:32.240 --> 02:40:36.490
Yet there were years
that went by, it seemed like...

1020
02:40:36.490 --> 02:40:39.950
...no time at all,
because you're not doing anything.

1021
02:40:39.950 --> 02:40:44.000
There were two things I couldn't
get out of my mind. One was Dominic.

1022
02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:47.610
The way he said, "I slipped,"
just before he died.

1023
02:40:48.500 --> 02:40:51.160
The other was you.

1024
02:40:56.970 --> 02:41:01.580
How you used to read me
your Song of Songs, remember?

1025
02:41:02.980 --> 02:41:07.840
How beautiful are your feet
In sandals, O prince's daughter

1026
02:41:11.070 --> 02:41:13.280
I used to read the Bible
every night.

1027
02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:16.650
Every night
I used to think about you.

1028
02:41:18.490 --> 02:41:23.660
Your navel is a bowl
Well-rounded with no lack of wine

1029
02:41:23.660 --> 02:41:27.420
Your belly, a heap of wheat
Surrounded with lilies

1030
02:41:27.420 --> 02:41:30.240
Your breasts

1031
02:41:31.380 --> 02:41:34.550
Clusters of grapes

1032
02:41:34.550 --> 02:41:39.330
Your breath, sweet-scented as apples

1033
02:41:46.480 --> 02:41:49.960
Nobody's gonna love you
the way I loved you.

1034
02:41:54.070 --> 02:41:57.740
At times I couldn't stand it.
I used to think about you.

1035
02:41:57.740 --> 02:42:01.990
I'd think, "Deborah lives.
She's out there. She exists."

1036
02:42:01.990 --> 02:42:04.900
And that would get me
through it all.

1037
02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:09.990
You know how important
that was to me?

1038
02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:18.630
I'm leaving tomorrow
to go to Hollywood.

1039
02:42:18.630 --> 02:42:21.830
I wanted to see you tonight
to tell you.

1040
02:44:15.540 --> 02:44:17.670
No.

1041
02:44:17.670 --> 02:44:19.880
No!

1042
02:44:19.880 --> 02:44:22.750
No! No.

1043
02:44:26.300 --> 02:44:31.550
No. Please, no. No, please. No!

1044
02:44:31.550 --> 02:44:37.020
No! No! No, please!

1045
02:44:37.020 --> 02:44:42.930
No, no! Please, no, no. No.

1046
02:44:45.480 --> 02:44:47.640
No!

1047
02:46:22.120 --> 02:46:23.950
Deborah.

1048
02:46:23.950 --> 02:46:26.730
Get away! Get away!

1049
02:46:43.260 --> 02:46:45.630
I'll be right back.

1050
02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:19.160
Take her home.

1051
02:47:19.670 --> 02:47:21.920
Take her home.

1052
02:48:58.650 --> 02:49:00.720
Hi.

1053
02:49:06.280 --> 02:49:08.400
Hi.

1054
02:49:10.780 --> 02:49:15.570
- Are you alone?
- No, I'm with you, I hope.

1055
02:49:17.410 --> 02:49:19.240
Wanna dance?

1056
02:49:19.870 --> 02:49:23.990
No, I'm not up to that.
You know what I want?

1057
02:49:24.710 --> 02:49:26.740
I want to fuck you.

1058
02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:31.380
That's what you're up to?

1059
02:49:43.150 --> 02:49:47.930
You drink like this every night
or this is just a bad night?

1060
02:49:59.750 --> 02:50:03.830
- Who are you, Mr. Rockefeller?
- No.

1061
02:50:04.540 --> 02:50:07.880
- Why, how much did I give you?
- 50.

1062
02:50:07.880 --> 02:50:09.620
50?

1063
02:50:10.510 --> 02:50:13.330
- What's your name?
- Eve.

1064
02:50:21.390 --> 02:50:24.090
I'll call you Deborah.

1065
02:50:24.610 --> 02:50:27.680
I did more complicated things
for less.

1066
02:50:28.320 --> 02:50:33.230
- Deborah... Do you love me?
- Yes.

1067
02:50:41.160 --> 02:50:43.610
You are so beautiful!

1068
02:50:46.040 --> 02:50:48.120
Thanks.

1069
02:51:18.030 --> 02:51:21.030
Your feet are so beautiful!

1070
02:51:21.030 --> 02:51:24.240
Sandals...

1071
02:51:24.240 --> 02:51:26.900
Prince's daughter...

1072
02:51:28.290 --> 02:51:30.620
Deborah...

1073
02:51:56.990 --> 02:51:59.260
Now I'll fuck you.

1074
02:52:00.820 --> 02:52:03.190
Take your time.

1075
02:57:05.240 --> 02:57:07.450
Well...

1076
02:57:07.450 --> 02:57:10.070
look who's back.

1077
02:57:10.960 --> 02:57:13.110
What's this?

1078
02:57:16.210 --> 02:57:18.360
It's a throne.

1079
02:57:20.130 --> 02:57:22.910
It was a gift to a pope.

1080
02:57:23.390 --> 02:57:29.000
- Cost me 800 bucks.
- It's from the 17th century.

1081
02:57:37.020 --> 02:57:39.890
So, what are you doing with it?

1082
02:57:42.320 --> 02:57:44.600
I'm sitting on it.

1083
02:57:52.500 --> 02:57:56.070
- You got any coffee around?
- Yes.

1084
02:58:07.510 --> 02:58:09.590
Thanks.

1085
02:59:27.090 --> 02:59:32.250
While you were on vacation,
we were working overtime.

1086
02:59:39.020 --> 02:59:41.550
The union paid off.

1087
02:59:44.020 --> 02:59:46.470
That's your share.

1088
02:59:47.190 --> 02:59:51.650
Yeah. Even that geek.
You know, Jimmy "Clean Hands."

1089
02:59:51.650 --> 02:59:57.620
He respects us.
I shed a little blood for the cause.

1090
02:59:57.620 --> 03:00:00.200
Here, it's all in the papers.

1091
03:00:00.200 --> 03:00:04.500
Morning Telegraph,
they didn't like it.

1092
03:00:04.500 --> 03:00:09.500
It says, "Underworld joins strikers
in brutal battle."

1093
03:00:09.500 --> 03:00:13.470
But The Post, they liked it.

1094
03:00:13.470 --> 03:00:17.600
"Ends justify means
in decisive gangland encounter."

1095
03:00:17.600 --> 03:00:21.140
And they kvetched
about the Atlantic City job.

1096
03:00:21.140 --> 03:00:25.090
Newspaper guys never know
what the fuck they want.

1097
03:00:31.610 --> 03:00:35.390
- Well, you could have looked for me.
- We did.

1098
03:00:36.320 --> 03:00:38.950
Cockeye found you at the Chink's.

1099
03:00:38.950 --> 03:00:41.910
So doped up
you didn't even recognize him.

1100
03:00:41.910 --> 03:00:47.490
There you were.
You called me "Deborah."

1101
03:00:48.830 --> 03:00:51.340
Go fuck yourself.
Mind your own business.

1102
03:00:51.340 --> 03:00:55.800
We do our business together,
and broads do not get in the way

1103
03:00:55.800 --> 03:00:57.260
- and you know it!
- Yeah?

1104
03:00:57.260 --> 03:00:59.910
- Yeah.
- What's she doing here?

1105
03:01:00.970 --> 03:01:04.720
It ain't Saturday.
She should be screwing in Detroit.

1106
03:01:04.720 --> 03:01:07.680
Well, she's screwing here now.

1107
03:01:07.680 --> 03:01:12.020
And only with Max.

1108
03:01:12.020 --> 03:01:14.150
Oh, yeah?

1109
03:01:14.150 --> 03:01:19.140
- With her husband peeping through?
- No, I left him.

1110
03:01:22.780 --> 03:01:26.700
You live with her and you tell me
not to mess with broads.

1111
03:01:26.700 --> 03:01:28.620
- You forget one thing.
- What?

1112
03:01:28.620 --> 03:01:30.960
- I don't give a fuck about her.
- Max...

1113
03:01:30.960 --> 03:01:34.380
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Maxie, tell me something.

1114
03:01:34.380 --> 03:01:36.380
What'll you spend your honeymoon on?

1115
03:01:36.380 --> 03:01:40.830
- Maxie.
- Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

1116
03:01:41.720 --> 03:01:44.210
Just shut up!

1117
03:01:48.270 --> 03:01:50.730
You want me to dump her?

1118
03:01:50.730 --> 03:01:54.730
You want me to kick
her fucking ass out of here?

1119
03:01:54.730 --> 03:01:57.230
Want me to kick her ass out
or what?

1120
03:01:57.230 --> 03:02:02.390
You want me to kick... Get the fuck
out! Get the fuck out! Get out!

1121
03:02:09.040 --> 03:02:12.280
Gonna tell me I don't have
a way with women?

1122
03:02:24.720 --> 03:02:27.640
- Hello. JIMMY: This is Jimmy.
Who's this, Max?

1123
03:02:27.640 --> 03:02:29.840
No, it's Noodles.

1124
03:02:31.770 --> 03:02:35.940
Okay, listen.
We're gonna need you guys today.

1125
03:02:35.940 --> 03:02:39.590
I'm gonna be making a tough speech,
and I think you...

1126
03:02:49.830 --> 03:02:52.280
Go, go!

1127
03:03:13.140 --> 03:03:16.560
Start the engine.
I'll be right with you.

1128
03:03:16.560 --> 03:03:20.980
Mr. Gallagher wants you to know
he appreciates what you did.

1129
03:03:20.980 --> 03:03:23.810
To show his appreciation...

1130
03:03:33.830 --> 03:03:37.120
Here's an envelope
for the both of you.

1131
03:03:37.120 --> 03:03:42.240
If we gotta complete the job,
I'll let you know.

1132
03:04:19.210 --> 03:04:21.830
Wiped out by a blast
of Cordon Rouge.

1133
03:04:21.830 --> 03:04:25.670
What would Crowning
and his bosses say after that?

1134
03:04:25.670 --> 03:04:27.710
Never be afraid of you, then.

1135
03:04:27.710 --> 03:04:32.720
They're still not afraid of me. It
was you boys that scared them off.

1136
03:04:32.720 --> 03:04:37.260
You didn't want these guys.
You're lucky you got party leaders

1137
03:04:37.260 --> 03:04:40.220
like me who care about the union.

1138
03:04:40.220 --> 03:04:44.230
The strike is settled. We won.
That's what counts. Am I right, Jim?

1139
03:04:44.230 --> 03:04:48.190
It was tough for Jimmy not to be
there to sign the contract.

1140
03:04:48.190 --> 03:04:50.140
No.

1141
03:04:51.400 --> 03:04:54.490
What's tough is,
you did more in a night

1142
03:04:54.490 --> 03:04:56.410
than I could in two years
of talking.

1143
03:04:56.410 --> 03:04:58.780
- Forget it.
- To the hottest newcomer

1144
03:04:58.780 --> 03:05:00.950
- in American unions.
- There you go.

1145
03:05:00.950 --> 03:05:03.200
- Jimmy Conway.
- Now you're talking.

1146
03:05:03.200 --> 03:05:04.790
Roll out the barrel.

1147
03:05:04.790 --> 03:05:09.250
- And God bless.
- Drink up. Suck it right down.

1148
03:05:09.250 --> 03:05:13.220
You must be crazy giving
him drinks. We're going to operate.

1149
03:05:13.220 --> 03:05:15.260
What's the rush?

1150
03:05:15.260 --> 03:05:18.340
They already told me I'd be a gimp
for the rest of my life.

1151
03:05:18.340 --> 03:05:23.680
Don't worry, with one leg a little
shy, you're gonna take giant steps.

1152
03:05:23.680 --> 03:05:27.980
Yeah. And always one step
right behind you, Sharkey?

1153
03:05:27.980 --> 03:05:30.860
Make sure they work on
the right leg, Jim.

1154
03:05:30.860 --> 03:05:34.060
It's only blood, huh?

1155
03:05:41.030 --> 03:05:46.200
You boys got yourself a real martyr
for a friend. Make it work for you.

1156
03:05:46.200 --> 03:05:49.750
Yeah, but what are we going to do
with a martyr?

1157
03:05:49.750 --> 03:05:53.960
Times change. Prohibition won't last
much longer. Take it from me,

1158
03:05:53.960 --> 03:05:56.260
a lot of you will be out
of work.

1159
03:05:56.260 --> 03:06:00.710
Go on, Mr. Sharkey.
We're interested.

1160
03:06:01.720 --> 03:06:05.640
You ever think of setting
yourselves up in business?

1161
03:06:05.640 --> 03:06:08.350
All those trucks
used to haul liquor,

1162
03:06:08.350 --> 03:06:10.720
soon be selling them for nothing.

1163
03:06:11.230 --> 03:06:13.730
I'm talking about
hundreds controlled

1164
03:06:13.730 --> 03:06:15.980
by a national organization.

1165
03:06:15.980 --> 03:06:19.740
And supported by a powerful union
headed by Jimmy.

1166
03:06:19.740 --> 03:06:24.490
Whatever you ask,
there's no way he can turn you down.

1167
03:06:24.490 --> 03:06:26.940
You gotta be kidding, Sharkey.

1168
03:06:28.750 --> 03:06:32.710
Jimmy "Clean Hands"
in business with us?

1169
03:06:32.710 --> 03:06:36.380
They won't be clean for long,
with the hands he'll shake.

1170
03:06:36.380 --> 03:06:39.410
Everything in good time.

1171
03:06:53.850 --> 03:06:58.020
- We're not interested. -What's
the matter, you got a problem?

1172
03:06:58.020 --> 03:07:01.860
We got plenty of money tucked away.
Why not invest it?

1173
03:07:01.860 --> 03:07:06.570
I'll put the party behind you.
And I got friends in high places.

1174
03:07:07.700 --> 03:07:11.500
I'm not interested,
and I don't trust politicians.

1175
03:07:11.500 --> 03:07:13.870
You still think
like some street schmuck.

1176
03:07:13.870 --> 03:07:17.000
If we'd listened to you,
we'd still be rolling drunks.

1177
03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:19.500
- You broke?
- Don't bust my balls.

1178
03:07:19.500 --> 03:07:23.050
I am talking about real money.

1179
03:07:23.050 --> 03:07:29.180
This is real money to me. It's a lot
of money. You want any of it?

1180
03:07:29.180 --> 03:07:33.770
- You carry that stink of the street.
- I like that. It makes me feel good.

1181
03:07:33.770 --> 03:07:37.980
I like the smell of it.
It opens up my lungs.

1182
03:07:37.980 --> 03:07:40.230
And it gives me a hard-on.

1183
03:07:40.230 --> 03:07:42.740
You're carrying dead weight, Maxie.

1184
03:07:42.740 --> 03:07:46.390
One of these days,
you're gonna have to dump it.

1185
03:07:49.620 --> 03:07:52.580
Let me know
when you're gonna dump me.

1186
03:07:52.580 --> 03:07:56.560
Meanwhile, I'll be in Florida.
I got a yen for the seashore.

1187
03:08:19.140 --> 03:08:21.260
Hey.

1188
03:08:22.730 --> 03:08:26.310
Listen, I was thinking it over
and...

1189
03:08:26.950 --> 03:08:31.400
I guess I kind of got a yen
for the seashore myself.

1190
03:08:36.620 --> 03:08:38.610
You wanna go swimming?

1191
03:08:39.080 --> 03:08:43.660
Yeah. Yeah, let's go for a swim.

1192
03:09:01.140 --> 03:09:03.800
Read all about it!

1193
03:09:05.650 --> 03:09:08.550
Read all about it!

1194
03:10:22.720 --> 03:10:25.270
Hey, Maxie.

1195
03:10:25.270 --> 03:10:27.810
- Max.
- Huh?

1196
03:10:27.810 --> 03:10:30.810
How much money we got put away?

1197
03:10:30.810 --> 03:10:32.640
Why?

1198
03:10:35.070 --> 03:10:37.890
Because we're unemployed.

1199
03:10:52.540 --> 03:10:55.550
About a million bucks.

1200
03:10:55.550 --> 03:11:00.660
- Oh, yeah? Where'd you put it?
- In my underwear.

1201
03:11:02.390 --> 03:11:06.500
- I'd have found it there.
- Hey.

1202
03:11:33.290 --> 03:11:38.250
We gotta reorganize, Max.
And I got a couple of good ideas.

1203
03:11:39.210 --> 03:11:41.220
Me too.

1204
03:11:41.220 --> 03:11:44.430
If I had a million bucks,
I'd take it easy.

1205
03:11:44.430 --> 03:11:47.210
We'll take it easy when we got 20.

1206
03:11:48.180 --> 03:11:51.920
- Fifty.
- Where you gonna get that?

1207
03:11:54.850 --> 03:11:56.930
Right here.

1208
03:12:05.860 --> 03:12:08.020
What's that?

1209
03:12:11.040 --> 03:12:13.360
It's a dream.

1210
03:12:15.370 --> 03:12:18.290
A dream I've been dreaming
all my life.

1211
03:12:18.290 --> 03:12:22.830
I swear to God, you and me together,
we can make it come true.

1212
03:12:26.340 --> 03:12:27.960
What is it?

1213
03:12:32.850 --> 03:12:35.090
The Federal Reserve Bank.

1214
03:12:38.400 --> 03:12:42.260
It's the biggest step
we can take, Noodles.

1215
03:13:04.920 --> 03:13:07.170
You're really crazy.

1216
03:13:07.970 --> 03:13:13.050
Don't you ever say that to me.
Don't ever say that to me again!

1217
03:14:38.390 --> 03:14:43.670
What chance is there that a crazy
thing like this might succeed?

1218
03:14:44.480 --> 03:14:46.810
Don't ask me, ask Max.

1219
03:14:46.810 --> 03:14:49.980
You know as well as I do
that this is suicide,

1220
03:14:49.980 --> 03:14:53.400
pure and simple, for everyone.

1221
03:14:53.400 --> 03:14:59.320
Yeah, well, don't tell me, tell him.
You got your own methods.

1222
03:14:59.320 --> 03:15:01.440
I tried.

1223
03:15:02.080 --> 03:15:05.560
He doesn't want to screw anymore.

1224
03:15:08.130 --> 03:15:11.860
All he thinks about is this job.

1225
03:15:13.960 --> 03:15:17.220
Tear gas, hostages,
now he's gonna do this.

1226
03:15:17.220 --> 03:15:21.040
He's gonna do it
with or without you.

1227
03:15:25.890 --> 03:15:29.720
Noodles, we've never liked
each other.

1228
03:15:33.610 --> 03:15:39.400
We put up with each other for Max.
So why don't we get together once

1229
03:15:39.400 --> 03:15:42.560
and do something for him.

1230
03:15:51.880 --> 03:15:54.250
And after that...

1231
03:15:54.880 --> 03:15:58.460
we can go back to being enemies.

1232
03:16:06.550 --> 03:16:11.770
You know,
if you were all in jail first,

1233
03:16:11.770 --> 03:16:15.260
there wouldn't be any bank job.

1234
03:16:26.410 --> 03:16:29.490
I got the idea from your friend Max.

1235
03:16:30.910 --> 03:16:32.530
What do you mean?

1236
03:16:35.210 --> 03:16:38.950
He laughs at you.
He makes fun of you.

1237
03:16:40.380 --> 03:16:43.840
He says Eve has got you
by the balls.

1238
03:16:43.840 --> 03:16:47.930
Every time you walk past this place,
you shit in your pants.

1239
03:16:47.930 --> 03:16:50.310
You'd do anything for the cops
to pick you up

1240
03:16:50.310 --> 03:16:53.840
so you wouldn't have to do this.

1241
03:17:06.700 --> 03:17:08.450
Well, then do it.

1242
03:17:08.450 --> 03:17:11.910
Do it. Put him in jail.
Put him in jail. Not long.

1243
03:17:11.910 --> 03:17:16.200
Just long enough so he can get
the idea out of his mind.

1244
03:17:17.580 --> 03:17:23.120
If you can't stand being away
from him, put yourself there too.

1245
03:17:24.300 --> 03:17:27.630
Better off than being dead.

1246
03:17:31.640 --> 03:17:34.340
You know what to do.

1247
03:17:37.560 --> 03:17:40.810
And if you don't, I will.

1248
03:17:43.820 --> 03:17:45.240
Get out!

1249
03:17:45.240 --> 03:17:49.890
Take a cab. I'm busy.
I got things to do. Get out.

1250
03:17:55.040 --> 03:17:56.560
Noodles.

1251
03:17:57.210 --> 03:18:00.530
Make up your mind fast, huh?

1252
03:19:24.830 --> 03:19:27.420
What's the matter?

1253
03:19:27.420 --> 03:19:30.320
Aren't you having a good time?

1254
03:19:36.720 --> 03:19:39.850
Why are you going out tonight?

1255
03:19:39.850 --> 03:19:43.500
Why bother now that prohibition
is almost over?

1256
03:19:45.140 --> 03:19:49.230
Everybody's selling. We got friends
who wanna get rid of booze.

1257
03:19:49.230 --> 03:19:54.090
Practically nothing.
So we figured, why not.

1258
03:19:59.870 --> 03:20:02.950
I'm gonna be gone for a while.

1259
03:20:02.950 --> 03:20:06.280
I'll be waiting at the hotel.

1260
03:20:06.710 --> 03:20:11.240
I like it when you come home
late and wake me up.

1261
03:20:16.420 --> 03:20:19.040
I'm not gonna be home tonight.

1262
03:20:25.640 --> 03:20:28.640
I'm not gonna be home tomorrow
either.

1263
03:20:28.640 --> 03:20:33.010
I thought these things
only take a couple of hours.

1264
03:20:38.990 --> 03:20:45.200
Ladies and gents, I drink to
the demise of Fat Moe's speakeasy.

1265
03:20:45.200 --> 03:20:50.000
Who the hell wants to drink
here legally anyway, am I right?

1266
03:20:50.000 --> 03:20:53.900
Okay. Come on, Moe, set them up.
Go on, get in there.

1267
03:21:08.520 --> 03:21:11.170
Here's mud in your eye.

1268
03:21:17.440 --> 03:21:19.340
Boys.

1269
03:21:22.320 --> 03:21:24.610
Let's drink to our last shipment.

1270
03:21:24.610 --> 03:21:27.620
There's more onboard
tonight than just booze.

1271
03:21:27.620 --> 03:21:33.210
It's 10 years of our lives. Ten
years that were really worth living.

1272
03:21:33.210 --> 03:21:34.990
Yeah.

1273
03:21:53.060 --> 03:21:55.300
Noodles.

1274
03:21:56.270 --> 03:21:58.270
Noodles.

1275
03:21:59.560 --> 03:22:02.560
- L'Chaim.
- L'Chaim.

1276
03:22:05.150 --> 03:22:08.150
How long will I have to wait?

1277
03:22:11.410 --> 03:22:15.320
A year and a half, more or less.

1278
03:22:16.290 --> 03:22:18.920
Six months off for good behavior.

1279
03:22:18.920 --> 03:22:22.160
- What are you gonna do?
- Don't ask.

1280
03:23:56.510 --> 03:23:58.760
FEMALE OPERATOR: Operator.

1281
03:23:59.680 --> 03:24:01.260
Police, please.

1282
03:24:06.860 --> 03:24:09.510
Fifth Precinct. Sergeant Halloran.

1283
03:24:11.860 --> 03:24:13.810
Hello.

1284
03:24:14.360 --> 03:24:17.620
Who's speaking? Can I help you?

1285
03:24:17.620 --> 03:24:20.020
- Hello.
- Yeah.

1286
03:24:22.200 --> 03:24:24.360
I got a good tip for you.

1287
03:24:50.440 --> 03:24:54.640
- Yeah, who is it?
- It's Max. Open the door.

1288
03:25:00.110 --> 03:25:04.330
- What's the matter with you?
You sick? -No, I'm fine.

1289
03:25:04.330 --> 03:25:06.400
You don't look it.

1290
03:25:08.120 --> 03:25:11.460
Maybe you'd better stay home
tonight, huh?

1291
03:25:11.460 --> 03:25:14.790
- Why?
- Huh.

1292
03:25:16.840 --> 03:25:20.170
You know, I've been watching you
all night.

1293
03:25:21.260 --> 03:25:24.510
And you've been drinking
like a fish.

1294
03:25:24.970 --> 03:25:27.800
Trying to get your courage up?

1295
03:25:30.900 --> 03:25:34.600
We're only bringing
in a shipment of booze.

1296
03:25:35.730 --> 03:25:39.340
It's got so you're even scared
to do that.

1297
03:25:40.700 --> 03:25:43.850
Maybe you just better
stay home tonight.

1298
03:25:44.490 --> 03:25:46.440
With Eve.

1299
03:25:56.380 --> 03:26:01.210
Hey, Maxie, everywhere you go,
I go too. Remember that.

1300
03:26:10.640 --> 03:26:13.270
Maybe Sharkey was right.

1301
03:26:13.270 --> 03:26:16.470
Maybe I ought to just dump you.

1302
03:26:25.200 --> 03:26:29.330
- You're really crazy.
- Never say that.

1303
03:26:29.330 --> 03:26:32.900
Don't say it!

1304
03:26:39.380 --> 03:26:43.630
Max made fools of us,
Noodles. He wanted to die.

1305
03:26:43.630 --> 03:26:46.840
Did you know his old man died
in the nut house?

1306
03:26:46.840 --> 03:26:49.890
Max didn't want to end up
the same way.

1307
03:26:49.890 --> 03:26:54.180
So he put the idea
in our heads to tip off the cops.

1308
03:26:54.180 --> 03:26:59.230
And when they stopped the truck,
Max started shooting first

1309
03:26:59.230 --> 03:27:02.930
just to get himself killed.

1310
03:27:19.710 --> 03:27:22.460
What is this?

1311
03:27:25.090 --> 03:27:26.660
Opening night.

1312
03:27:27.930 --> 03:27:31.050
Fifteen years ago.

1313
03:27:31.050 --> 03:27:33.460
Who's this?

1314
03:27:34.770 --> 03:27:38.170
Patron saint of the place.

1315
03:27:39.140 --> 03:27:42.190
And some actress.

1316
03:27:42.190 --> 03:27:43.970
Do you know her?

1317
03:27:45.570 --> 03:27:47.520
No.

1318
03:28:15.800 --> 03:28:18.300
This proves me base:

1319
03:28:19.270 --> 03:28:22.230
If she first meet the curled Antony,
he'll make demand of her,

1320
03:28:22.230 --> 03:28:25.840
and spend that kiss
which is my heaven to have.

1321
03:28:48.800 --> 03:28:51.540
Come, thou mortal wretch,

1322
03:28:53.800 --> 03:28:58.880
with thy sharp teeth this knot
intrinsicate of life at once untie:

1323
03:29:01.140 --> 03:29:03.760
poor venomous fool.

1324
03:29:05.690 --> 03:29:09.140
Be angry, and dispatch.

1325
03:29:11.530 --> 03:29:14.770
Oh, couldst thou speak,

1326
03:29:15.280 --> 03:29:19.660
that I might hear thee call
great Caesar ass unpolicied!

1327
03:29:19.660 --> 03:29:22.540
Oh eastern star! Peace, peace!

1328
03:29:22.540 --> 03:29:25.000
Dost thou not see my baby
at my breast,

1329
03:29:25.000 --> 03:29:28.670
that sucks the nurse asleep?
Oh, break! Oh, break!

1330
03:29:28.670 --> 03:29:31.460
As sweet as balm,

1331
03:29:31.460 --> 03:29:35.750
as soft as air, as gentle...

1332
03:29:37.050 --> 03:29:39.370
Oh, Antony!

1333
03:29:47.180 --> 03:29:49.720
Nay, I will take thee too.

1334
03:29:57.110 --> 03:29:59.490
What should I stay...

1335
03:29:59.490 --> 03:30:03.220
In this vile world?
So, fare thee well.

1336
03:30:03.950 --> 03:30:08.960
Now boast thee, death, in thy
possession lies a lass unparallel'd.

1337
03:30:08.960 --> 03:30:11.170
Downy windows, close,

1338
03:30:11.170 --> 03:30:15.670
and golden Phoebus never be beheld
of eyes again so royal!

1339
03:30:15.670 --> 03:30:19.450
Your crown's awry.
I'll mend it, and then play.

1340
03:30:56.710 --> 03:30:59.410
Hello, Deborah.

1341
03:31:06.600 --> 03:31:09.670
Aren't you gonna say anything?

1342
03:31:16.020 --> 03:31:19.980
What is someone
supposed to say after...

1343
03:31:19.980 --> 03:31:23.440
...more than 30 years.

1344
03:31:28.160 --> 03:31:33.770
Well, how about, "How you doing?
You're looking good." Or...

1345
03:31:36.120 --> 03:31:39.700
"I was hoping
I'd never see you again."

1346
03:31:41.710 --> 03:31:45.120
I never thought I would.

1347
03:31:45.800 --> 03:31:48.850
There's a difference.

1348
03:31:48.850 --> 03:31:51.310
At least you recognized me,
that's something.

1349
03:31:51.310 --> 03:31:55.540
Actresses have good memories.

1350
03:32:04.900 --> 03:32:07.650
You want a drink?

1351
03:32:11.450 --> 03:32:14.280
I'm having one.

1352
03:32:24.300 --> 03:32:25.740
Margo.

1353
03:32:27.090 --> 03:32:29.970
- Yes, miss?
- That's all. You can go.

1354
03:32:29.970 --> 03:32:32.590
All right, miss.

1355
03:32:37.060 --> 03:32:40.270
She called you "miss."

1356
03:32:40.270 --> 03:32:43.090
You never got married?

1357
03:32:43.520 --> 03:32:45.550
No.

1358
03:32:48.740 --> 03:32:50.680
You live alone?

1359
03:32:58.410 --> 03:33:00.320
No.

1360
03:33:06.750 --> 03:33:09.500
Where were you?

1361
03:33:12.010 --> 03:33:14.830
I was out of town.

1362
03:33:17.260 --> 03:33:20.470
Have you been back long?

1363
03:33:21.020 --> 03:33:23.600
A couple of days.

1364
03:33:23.600 --> 03:33:26.260
Are you staying?

1365
03:33:37.490 --> 03:33:39.310
That depends.

1366
03:33:41.830 --> 03:33:44.320
Why do you want to see me?

1367
03:33:45.750 --> 03:33:48.250
Two reasons.

1368
03:33:48.250 --> 03:33:51.510
First, I wanted to see
if you did the right thing,

1369
03:33:51.510 --> 03:33:54.000
turning me down
to become an actress.

1370
03:33:57.930 --> 03:33:59.920
Well?

1371
03:34:02.180 --> 03:34:05.010
You did. You're terrific.

1372
03:34:20.200 --> 03:34:23.490
"Age cannot wither her."

1373
03:34:23.490 --> 03:34:26.900
It's like the play
was written for you.

1374
03:34:29.960 --> 03:34:32.630
What was the other reason?

1375
03:34:32.630 --> 03:34:35.330
The other reason...

1376
03:34:38.130 --> 03:34:42.870
...is to decide whether I should go
to a party tomorrow night.

1377
03:34:49.190 --> 03:34:51.130
Party?

1378
03:34:54.020 --> 03:34:56.930
Yeah, on Long Island.

1379
03:34:58.030 --> 03:35:01.600
A Secretary Bailey.

1380
03:35:05.030 --> 03:35:07.610
Do you know Secretary Bailey?

1381
03:35:09.040 --> 03:35:10.660
No.

1382
03:35:12.670 --> 03:35:15.410
But I was invited anyway.

1383
03:35:23.510 --> 03:35:26.560
If you don't know each other,
why were you invited?

1384
03:35:26.560 --> 03:35:28.500
I don't know.

1385
03:35:29.730 --> 03:35:32.180
I thought you might know why.

1386
03:35:32.810 --> 03:35:34.400
Me?

1387
03:35:34.400 --> 03:35:36.430
Why me?

1388
03:35:41.440 --> 03:35:43.770
Because you know him.

1389
03:35:44.820 --> 03:35:46.450
- Who is it?
- David.

1390
03:35:46.450 --> 03:35:49.330
- No, David.
- Can I come in?

1391
03:35:49.330 --> 03:35:52.370
No. Just wait outside,
I'll call you.

1392
03:35:52.370 --> 03:35:55.150
Okay, I'll be right here.

1393
03:35:57.540 --> 03:36:01.550
- What does Bailey want from me?
- You came to ask me that?

1394
03:36:01.550 --> 03:36:04.720
- Why'd he send me an invitation?
- I don't know.

1395
03:36:04.720 --> 03:36:09.260
Why should I know about your
invitations? I don't know anything.

1396
03:36:09.260 --> 03:36:13.440
What do you want? Why did you come
here? I know nothing.

1397
03:36:13.440 --> 03:36:16.510
Now you're a lousy actress.

1398
03:36:18.940 --> 03:36:22.190
Who is Secretary Bailey?

1399
03:36:30.530 --> 03:36:34.570
Secretary Bailey
is a rich businessman.

1400
03:36:39.880 --> 03:36:44.670
He came to the United States as an
immigrant and made a lot of money...

1401
03:36:44.670 --> 03:36:48.800
...in San Francisco and L.A.,
where he's lived for 30 years.

1402
03:36:48.800 --> 03:36:53.210
I know all that. It's all
in the papers. What else is there?

1403
03:36:59.310 --> 03:37:02.720
He married a very wealthy woman.

1404
03:37:03.610 --> 03:37:06.320
They had a child.

1405
03:37:06.320 --> 03:37:09.950
She died when the child was born.

1406
03:37:09.950 --> 03:37:14.660
A few years ago, he went
into politics. Moved here.

1407
03:37:14.660 --> 03:37:19.870
That's history. I'm not talking
about that. I'm talking about now.

1408
03:37:19.870 --> 03:37:22.900
Right now he's in trouble.

1409
03:37:24.170 --> 03:37:27.720
Just tell me you've been living
with him all these years,

1410
03:37:27.720 --> 03:37:30.090
and you're his lover.

1411
03:37:38.520 --> 03:37:41.920
Age can wither me, Noodles.

1412
03:37:45.230 --> 03:37:48.260
We're both getting old.

1413
03:37:53.200 --> 03:37:56.900
All that we have left now
are our memories.

1414
03:37:59.410 --> 03:38:05.780
If you go to that party on Saturday
night, you won't have those anymore.

1415
03:38:06.750 --> 03:38:09.620
Tear up that invitation.

1416
03:38:11.590 --> 03:38:14.620
There's an exit back this way.

1417
03:38:15.140 --> 03:38:18.460
Noodles, go through it.

1418
03:38:20.720 --> 03:38:22.810
Keep walking.

1419
03:38:22.810 --> 03:38:25.470
Don't turn around.

1420
03:38:26.400 --> 03:38:28.730
Please, Noodles.

1421
03:38:28.730 --> 03:38:32.140
I'm begging you. Please.

1422
03:38:38.200 --> 03:38:42.150
Are you afraid that I'll turn
into a pillar of salt?

1423
03:38:45.250 --> 03:38:49.410
If you go out that door, yes.

1424
03:39:47.220 --> 03:39:50.400
This is Secretary Bailey's son.

1425
03:39:50.400 --> 03:39:54.300
His name's David, just like yours.

1426
03:42:26.340 --> 03:42:32.010
I must admit this party was
a wonderful idea, Mr. Secretary.

1427
03:42:32.010 --> 03:42:35.720
It's a bit like saying, "I'm going
up before the Commettee in 5 days,

1428
03:42:35.720 --> 03:42:38.350
like, my conscience is clear.

1429
03:42:38.350 --> 03:42:42.480
The most important people
in New York are my guests.

1430
03:42:42.480 --> 03:42:45.770
It's going to be a night
to remember."

1431
03:42:45.770 --> 03:42:48.350
Especially if the house blows up.

1432
03:42:48.820 --> 03:42:51.350
Where are you putting the next bomb?

1433
03:42:52.450 --> 03:42:54.600
In the freezer?

1434
03:42:55.200 --> 03:42:57.520
Or in the toilet?

1435
03:43:05.210 --> 03:43:08.580
You can't even think straight
anymore.

1436
03:43:09.300 --> 03:43:11.670
I'll tell you something.

1437
03:43:11.670 --> 03:43:16.830
A waiting list of people would like
to send flowers to your funeral.

1438
03:43:18.600 --> 03:43:22.390
- I can point out ten right now,
if you like me to. -Yes.

1439
03:43:22.390 --> 03:43:25.520
But none of them wants to read my
obituary in front of the Committee

1440
03:43:25.520 --> 03:43:27.690
as much as you do.

1441
03:43:27.690 --> 03:43:29.890
You and your union.

1442
03:43:32.940 --> 03:43:35.860
We just want to resolve
this situation clean.

1443
03:43:35.860 --> 03:43:39.570
I've heard that same song from you
for 35 fucking years!

1444
03:43:39.570 --> 03:43:42.350
Who do you think you are talking to?

1445
03:43:43.620 --> 03:43:47.420
I helped you to make a fortune,
you and the rest of those parasites!

1446
03:43:47.420 --> 03:43:52.410
It was a reasonable arrangement
between labour and management.

1447
03:43:53.420 --> 03:43:57.260
2% for them and 40% for you.

1448
03:43:57.260 --> 03:44:01.010
You defend them and you screw them.
Come on!

1449
03:44:01.010 --> 03:44:03.630
It's been the story of your life.

1450
03:44:04.220 --> 03:44:07.880
- Do you think anybody believe you
anymore? -Some.

1451
03:44:08.520 --> 03:44:11.190
But no one believes in you anymore,

1452
03:44:11.190 --> 03:44:14.640
because you have made mistakes
and I haven't.

1453
03:44:15.610 --> 03:44:18.690
But that's beside the point.

1454
03:44:20.110 --> 03:44:23.080
The important thing right now
is that

1455
03:44:23.080 --> 03:44:26.780
you and I straighten out
these transfers of authority.

1456
03:44:28.790 --> 03:44:31.540
Now it's all as we have agreed.

1457
03:44:34.420 --> 03:44:37.370
Have had our lawyers drawn it up.

1458
03:44:39.010 --> 03:44:41.710
All you have to do is sign.

1459
03:44:49.600 --> 03:44:51.930
My last will?

1460
03:44:53.150 --> 03:44:56.300
You are not in a position
to exercise your will.

1461
03:44:58.530 --> 03:45:01.230
I give up everything.

1462
03:45:02.610 --> 03:45:05.530
12% would be set aside for your boy.

1463
03:45:05.530 --> 03:45:10.270
In that way he can be assured
of living to a ripe old age.

1464
03:45:10.950 --> 03:45:14.160
Or not, if I don't sign?

1465
03:46:24.400 --> 03:46:27.650
Why don't you take care of this
by yourself?

1466
03:46:28.660 --> 03:46:32.200
I'd be very happy for you tonight,
if during all the noise of the party

1467
03:46:32.200 --> 03:46:35.610
- I heard a shot.
- Maybe you will.

1468
03:47:47.940 --> 03:47:50.190
Please go in.

1469
03:48:03.830 --> 03:48:06.580
What are you waiting for?

1470
03:48:09.840 --> 03:48:12.910
I don't understand, Mr. Bailey.

1471
03:48:38.990 --> 03:48:41.490
Sit down, Noodles.

1472
03:48:45.330 --> 03:48:47.530
Make yourself comfortable.

1473
03:49:05.520 --> 03:49:08.390
I'm glad you accepted my invitation.

1474
03:49:08.390 --> 03:49:10.800
Well, I was curious.

1475
03:49:13.360 --> 03:49:16.690
So many important people
in one place.

1476
03:49:16.690 --> 03:49:21.030
Yes. Well, the rats usually
desert a sinking ship.

1477
03:49:21.030 --> 03:49:25.360
But in my case, they appear to be
flocking onboard.

1478
03:49:36.590 --> 03:49:40.820
Yeah, well, I read about
your troubles in the newspapers.

1479
03:49:41.800 --> 03:49:43.760
But a man in your position,

1480
03:49:43.760 --> 03:49:46.680
with all your power
and all your privileges...

1481
03:49:46.680 --> 03:49:51.600
...has to assume a certain amount
of responsibility...

1482
03:49:51.600 --> 03:49:54.470
...a certain amount of risk.

1483
03:50:01.530 --> 03:50:04.680
Why'd you ask me
to come here, Mr. Bailey?

1484
03:50:07.620 --> 03:50:12.500
That invitation doesn't mean
a goddamn thing, and you know it.

1485
03:50:12.500 --> 03:50:16.450
All that counts is what
was in that suitcase.

1486
03:50:17.710 --> 03:50:20.830
The money and the contract.

1487
03:50:23.260 --> 03:50:26.870
It didn't say who the contract
was on, though.

1488
03:50:27.800 --> 03:50:30.630
Haven't you figured that out yet?

1489
03:50:31.930 --> 03:50:33.880
You, Mr. Bailey?

1490
03:50:47.280 --> 03:50:51.390
I haven't had a gun in my hand
for many, many years.

1491
03:50:52.620 --> 03:50:58.580
My eyes aren't too good, even
with my glasses. My hands shake.

1492
03:51:01.050 --> 03:51:05.450
- And I wouldn't want to miss.
- Cut the bullshit, Noodles.

1493
03:51:06.590 --> 03:51:09.750
I'm already a dead man.

1494
03:51:10.260 --> 03:51:15.350
At least give me the chance to
settle the debt that I owe to you.

1495
03:51:15.350 --> 03:51:19.020
I'll never make it before
the investigating committee.

1496
03:51:19.020 --> 03:51:23.360
They're scared I'll implicate
the whole bunch of 'em.

1497
03:51:23.360 --> 03:51:25.980
They gotta get rid of me.

1498
03:51:28.240 --> 03:51:31.610
Today is as good a day as any.

1499
03:51:33.530 --> 03:51:36.160
You do it, Noodles.

1500
03:51:36.700 --> 03:51:40.490
You're the only person
I can accept it from.

1501
03:51:46.960 --> 03:51:49.720
You see, I found out where you were.

1502
03:51:49.720 --> 03:51:53.200
I brought you back here for this.

1503
03:51:54.140 --> 03:51:57.750
To even the score
between you and me.

1504
03:51:59.730 --> 03:52:02.600
You can get out through there.

1505
03:52:09.440 --> 03:52:14.400
It leads right down to the street.
Nobody will see you.

1506
03:52:20.750 --> 03:52:25.530
I don't know what you're talking
about. You don't owe me a thing.

1507
03:52:33.090 --> 03:52:37.760
Your eyes were too full of tears
to see it wasn't me burned up

1508
03:52:37.760 --> 03:52:39.630
on that street.

1509
03:52:40.060 --> 03:52:42.340
It was somebody else.

1510
03:52:43.520 --> 03:52:49.070
You were too shocked to realize
that the cops were in on it too.

1511
03:52:49.070 --> 03:52:52.680
That was a syndicate operation,
Noodles.

1512
03:53:02.580 --> 03:53:04.980
You're crazy.

1513
03:53:07.040 --> 03:53:11.590
You said that to me once before,
a long time ago.

1514
03:53:11.590 --> 03:53:15.800
My mind was never as clear
as it was at that moment.

1515
03:53:15.800 --> 03:53:19.510
I took away your whole life
from you.

1516
03:53:19.510 --> 03:53:22.760
I've been living in your place.

1517
03:53:23.600 --> 03:53:26.600
I took everything.

1518
03:53:27.600 --> 03:53:30.480
I took your money.

1519
03:53:30.480 --> 03:53:33.320
I took your girl.

1520
03:53:33.320 --> 03:53:38.520
All I left for you was 35 years
of grief over having killed me.

1521
03:53:39.950 --> 03:53:42.150
Now, why don't you shoot?

1522
03:55:16.380 --> 03:55:19.500
It's true,
I have killed people, Mr. Bailey.

1523
03:55:19.500 --> 03:55:24.550
Sometimes to defend myself.
Sometimes for money.

1524
03:55:24.550 --> 03:55:27.300
And many people used to come to us.

1525
03:55:27.300 --> 03:55:30.600
Business partners, rivals...

1526
03:55:30.600 --> 03:55:33.140
...lovers.

1527
03:55:33.140 --> 03:55:37.680
Some of the jobs we took,
and some we didn't.

1528
03:55:50.660 --> 03:55:54.030
Yours is one we would never touch.

1529
03:55:54.500 --> 03:55:57.870
Is this your way of getting revenge?

1530
03:56:01.420 --> 03:56:03.410
No.

1531
03:56:06.340 --> 03:56:09.870
It's just the way I see things.

1532
03:57:12.160 --> 03:57:15.360
It's 10:25...

1533
03:57:16.240 --> 03:57:19.820
...and I've got nothing left
to lose.

1534
03:57:21.540 --> 03:57:25.900
When you've been betrayed
by a friend, you hit back.

1535
03:57:30.550 --> 03:57:32.790
Do it.

1536
03:57:54.530 --> 03:57:57.560
You see, Mr. Secretary...

1537
03:57:59.160 --> 03:58:01.650
...I have a story also.

1538
03:58:02.200 --> 03:58:05.150
A little simpler than yours.

1539
03:58:05.870 --> 03:58:10.990
Many years ago I had a friend,
a dear friend.

1540
03:58:12.210 --> 03:58:15.670
I turned him in to save his life...

1541
03:58:15.670 --> 03:58:18.380
...but he was killed.

1542
03:58:19.260 --> 03:58:22.510
But he wanted it that way.

1543
03:58:23.140 --> 03:58:25.760
It was a great friendship.

1544
03:58:28.440 --> 03:58:32.890
It went bad for him,
and it went bad for me too.

1545
03:58:37.450 --> 03:58:40.020
Good night, Mr. Bailey.

1546
03:58:48.790 --> 03:58:52.900
I hope the investigation
turns out to be nothing.

1547
03:58:54.420 --> 03:58:58.870
It'd be a shame to see
a lifetime of work go to waste.
