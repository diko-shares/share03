[JOHN]: <i>What a show!</i>

1535
01:43:23.448 --> 01:43:27.567
I think we have just seen some a
cappella history being made, John.

1536
01:43:27.661 --> 01:43:31.529
And from an all-female group, Gail.
I could never have called this one.

1537
01:43:31.623 --> 01:43:34.240
Never. Well, you are
a misogynist at heart,

1538
01:43:34.334 --> 01:43:36.371
so there's no way you would
have bet on these girls to win.

I have been rejected by the Army,
shoved into a Dora the Explorer backpack,

1546
01:44:16.293 --> 01:44:19.752
and pushed into the girls' locker
room wearing nothing but suspenders.

1547
01:44:19.838 --> 01:44:22.751
But no matter.
I am in the world that I love.
