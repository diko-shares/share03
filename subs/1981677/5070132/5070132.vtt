00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:53.398
Now, this is exactly the type of
performance you would expect to see

4
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.735
at the international Championship
of Collegiate A Cappella.

5
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.966
Am I right, Gail?

6
00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:00.121
John, you're so right,
everything else seems wrong.

JOHN: Boy, these Barden University
Treblemakers always thrill the judges.

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:05.873
And the ladies in the room
cannot get enough.

So true, John.

10
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.813
Nothing makes a woman feel more like a
girl than a man who sings like a boy.

We're hand in hand, chest to chest

Chloe, look at you. You're a mess.
You're unfocused. You're unreliable.

18
00:01:42.084 --> 00:01:46.145
And your breath smells
like egg. Like, all the time.

19
00:01:46.222 --> 00:01:48.338

I won't disappoint you.

23
00:01:53.896 --> 00:01:55.816
My dad always says,
"if you're not here to win,

24
00:01:55.817 --> 00:01:57.163
"get the hell out of Kuwait."

25
00:01:57.566 --> 00:01:59.693
Has your dad ever told you to shut up?

26
00:02:03.405 --> 00:02:04.929
I'm fine.

JOHN: Well, the Bellas
tonight are making history

41
00:03:05.366 --> 00:03:08.961
as the first ever all-female group
to advance to the ICCA finals.

42
00:03:09.037 --> 00:03:11.717
GAIL: That's right, John. Now, why
do you think it's taken so long

43
00:03:11.718 --> 00:03:14.570
for an all-lady group to break through
that a cappella glass ceiling?

44
00:03:14.642 --> 00:03:17.805
Well, Gail, the women, typically,
cannot hit the low notes,

45
00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.439
which really round out an
arrangement, thrill the judges,

46
00:03:20.515 --> 00:03:22.380
and that can really hurt
them in competition.

47
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.248
Women are about as good at a cappella
as they are at being doctors.

Is it me or did we just take a
left turn into Snoozeville?

58
00:04:05.126 --> 00:04:07.788
Yeah, and we parked in a lot
where they do not validate.

you're gonna go down this way,

It was really Jewish.

Here's the real question.

517
00:31:34.786 --> 00:31:36.146
Who would be easier to sleep with?

518
00:31:36.147 --> 00:31:37.850
Captain America or a great white shark?

519
00:31:38.223 --> 00:31:39.703
Great white shark. I wouldn't... Hey.

522
00:31:43.195 --> 00:31:47.859
You are probably the grossest
human being I've ever seen.

523
00:31:48.267 --> 00:31:50.462
Well, you're no
panty-dropper yourself.

524
00:31:51.136 --> 00:31:55.664
So I have a feeling
that we should kiss.

525
00:31:55.741 --> 00:31:59.199
And is that feeling a good
feeling or an incorrect feeling?

526
00:31:59.278 --> 00:32:01.872
Well, I sometimes have a
feeling I can do crystal meth,

527
00:32:01.947 --> 00:32:04.939
but then I think, "Hmm.
Better not." Yeah.

528
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:07.910

your head up

was Treble-boned.

Stacie, the Trebles don't respect us,

555
00:33:22.259 --> 00:33:23.851
and if we let them penetrate us,

556
00:33:24.228 --> 00:33:25.718
we are giving them our power.

557
00:33:25.796 --> 00:33:28.128
Not a good enough reason
to use the word "penetrate."

558
00:33:28.199 --> 00:33:32.795
So, does anyone here
have anything to confess?

00:41:39.484 --> 00:41:40.746
You want me to get you lunch?

689
00:41:41.652 --> 00:41:43.292
You should probably
lay off the burgers.

690
00:41:43.506 --> 00:41:45.186
You're not gonna
be 22 forever, you know.

691
00:41:46.691 --> 00:41:48.591
Yeah, I think I'm good.

692
00:41:48.659 --> 00:41:50.752
He's good.
You're good.

693
00:41:51.529 --> 00:41:53.827
And the chess match continues.

694
00:41:58.034 --> 00:42:00.502
Hey, this is my new mix,

695
00:42:00.798 --> 00:42:02.598
so if there's anything
you wanted to play...

696
00:42:02.672 --> 00:42:04.333
Yeah, okay, I'll put it on the pile.

697
00:42:04.508 --> 00:42:05.975
Okay.

698
00:42:11.181 --> 00:42:13.081
What's up, weirdo?

699
00:42:13.149 --> 00:42:14.673
Okay.

700
00:42:17.454 --> 00:42:19.285
What's this?
As much as I love

701
00:42:19.356 --> 00:42:21.586
spending time with you stacking CDs...
And I do.

702
00:42:21.658 --> 00:42:23.819
I love it, like, more than life.

703
00:42:24.427 --> 00:42:26.307
...I figured we could do
some other fun things

704
00:42:26.308 --> 00:42:28.228
that don't make us wanna
kill ourselves, right?

705
00:42:28.229 --> 00:42:30.491
Yeah.
So, brought some movies.

706
00:42:31.034 --> 00:42:36.700
Jaws, E. T., The Breakfast
Club, Star Wars and Rocky.

707
00:42:36.773 --> 00:42:39.571
Best scored and soundtracked
movies of all time.

708
00:42:39.776 --> 00:42:42.973
That's what I wanna do when I grow up.
I wanna score movies.

709
00:42:43.046 --> 00:42:45.086
Bring people to tears,
you know. Blow their minds.

710
00:42:45.382 --> 00:42:47.612
I feel like only music can do that.

711
00:42:47.851 --> 00:42:49.045
Yeah.

712
00:42:49.119 --> 00:42:51.199
You must really sweep
your girlfriend off her feet.

713
00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.240
I don't have a girlfriend.

714
00:42:52.255 --> 00:42:53.347
What?
No.

715
00:42:53.423 --> 00:42:55.755
You have juice pouches and Rocky.

716
00:42:55.825 --> 00:42:58.293
Okay, so what do you wanna watch first?

717
00:42:58.361 --> 00:42:59.487
Wanna do something else?

718
00:42:59.996 --> 00:43:02.226
We could relive my parents' divorce.

719
00:43:02.299 --> 00:43:03.630
Or visit a gynecologist.

720
00:43:04.301 --> 00:43:06.021
What, do you not like
movies or something?

721
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:08.532
Like, any movies? You don't...

722
00:43:08.872 --> 00:43:12.137
What the hell is wrong with you?
How do you not like movies?

723
00:43:12.208 --> 00:43:15.006
Not liking movies is like
not liking puppies.

724
00:43:15.078 --> 00:43:17.546
They're fine. I just get bored
and never make it to the end.

725
00:43:17.948 --> 00:43:19.915
The endings are the best part.

726
00:43:20.215 --> 00:43:22.877
They're predictable.
Like, the guy gets the girl,

727
00:43:22.952 --> 00:43:26.649
and that kid sees dead people and
Darth Vader is Luke's father.

728
00:43:26.722 --> 00:43:30.419
Okay, right, so you just happened to guess
the biggest cinematic reveal in history?

729
00:43:30.926 --> 00:43:33.121
"Vader" in German means father.

730
00:43:33.195 --> 00:43:35.686
His name is literally
"Darth Father."

731
00:43:36.532 --> 00:43:37.521
Huh.

732
00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:39.360
So, you know German.

733
00:43:39.435 --> 00:43:42.336
Well, now I know
why you don't like fun things.

734
00:43:42.404 --> 00:43:44.497
You know, you need a movie education.

735
00:43:44.573 --> 00:43:46.905
You need a movie-cation.
And I'm gonna give it to you.

736
00:43:47.009 --> 00:43:49.807
Yeah, in between Bella
rehearsals, which are always.

737
00:43:50.412 --> 00:43:52.212
Are you guys getting
ready for the riff-off?

738
00:43:53.148 --> 00:43:54.706

is a riff-off?

have the same chord progressions

blends them together.

01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:20.281
Jesus.
That's really crazy.

1540
01:28:21.923 --> 01:28:24.949
I get it. Mine
gets on me, too.

1541
01:28:25.027 --> 01:28:26.859
Not like that, but...

1542
01:28:28.865 --> 01:28:31.145
I guess we don't really know
that much about each other.

1543
01:28:31.567 --> 01:28:33.831
About most of you, really.

1544
01:28:34.404 --> 01:28:38.135
Well, I'll confess something
that none of you know about me.

1545
01:28:38.207 --> 01:28:39.697
(INHALES AND EXHALES DEEPLY)

1546
01:28:39.776 --> 01:28:41.209
I have a lot of sex.

1547
01:28:41.277 --> 01:28:42.539
Yeah, we know, Stacie.

1548
01:28:43.746 --> 01:28:45.043
Only 'cause I just told you.

1549
01:28:45.114 --> 01:28:46.240
This is a good idea.

1550
01:28:46.716 --> 01:28:49.446
That was a pretty bad example,
but this is a good idea.

1551
01:28:49.519 --> 01:28:53.819
Why don't we all go around the room,

1552
01:28:54.557 --> 01:28:58.755
and we can all say something about
ourselves that nobody else knows.

1553
01:28:59.429 --> 01:29:01.522
Okay, I got something.

1554
01:29:01.931 --> 01:29:04.695
This is hard for me to
admit to you guys.

1555
01:29:04.901 --> 01:29:08.530
I think we all know where this
is going. Let's be honest.

1556
01:29:10.039 --> 01:29:14.806
Well, for the last two
years, I've had a serious

1557
01:29:15.612 --> 01:29:16.704
gambling problem.

1558
01:29:17.181 --> 01:29:18.273
What?
What?

1559
01:29:18.582 --> 01:29:20.516
It started when I broke
up with my girlfriend.

1560
01:29:20.818 --> 01:29:22.581
(SINGING) Whoomp! There it is

1561
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:27.914
(MOUTHING) I still love you.

1562
01:29:32.996 --> 01:29:34.463
BECA: Anyone else?

1563
01:29:37.768 --> 01:29:39.395
(QUIETLY) I ate my twin in the womb.

1564
01:29:41.305 --> 01:29:42.397
What?

1565
01:29:45.743 --> 01:29:46.767
Okay.

1566
01:29:48.846 --> 01:29:49.870
Fat Amy?

1567
01:29:50.547 --> 01:29:52.105
I'm an open book.

1568
01:29:52.182 --> 01:29:54.707
I mean, for God's sake,
you guys all call me Fat Amy.

1569
01:29:55.986 --> 01:30:00.923
See, I guess I'm just not really
living if I'm not being 100% honest.

1570
01:30:04.128 --> 01:30:06.529
And my real name is Fat Patricia.

1571
01:30:07.766 --> 01:30:09.063
WOMAN: What?

1572
01:30:10.435 --> 01:30:14.201
Okay. I've never been
one of those girls

1573
01:30:15.373 --> 01:30:18.809
who had a lot of friends
who were girls. And I do now.

1574
01:30:20.445 --> 01:30:22.140
And that's pretty cool.

1575
01:30:25.150 --> 01:30:27.744
So, that's me.
Someone else please go.

1576
01:30:29.988 --> 01:30:30.977
Okay.

1577
01:30:33.658 --> 01:30:39.426
Over spring break, I made the
courageous decision to remove my nodes.

1578
01:30:39.597 --> 01:30:40.689
(GASPS)

1579
01:30:40.999 --> 01:30:45.936
I know. The doctor said that
I can't sing above a G-sharp,

1580
01:30:46.905 --> 01:30:48.270
maybe ever.

1581
01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:52.000
(SOBBING) I thought
the season was over.

1582
01:30:55.981 --> 01:30:58.211
It's okay. It's okay.

1583
01:31:00.486 --> 01:31:03.546
Beca, what do we do?

1584
01:31:13.165 --> 01:31:14.598
I'm sorry.

1585
01:31:15.401 --> 01:31:16.493
Maybe not here.

1586
01:31:17.636 --> 01:31:20.434
All right. Let's
remix this business.

1587
01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:26.036
Aubrey, would you
pick a song for us, please?

1589
01:31:30.416 --> 01:31:33.442

I don't know, I've never
made that sound before.

1620
01:33:31.506 --> 01:33:34.346
Yo, but with your messed up vocal
cords, you could hit the bass notes.

1778
01:43:24.443 --> 01:43:28.608
I think we have just seen some a
cappella history being made, John.

1779
01:43:28.682 --> 01:43:32.584
And from an all-female group, Gail.
I could never have called this one.

1780
01:43:32.652 --> 01:43:34.979
Never. Well, you are
a misogynist at heart,

1781
01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:37.380
so there's no way you would
have bet on these girls to win.

it up again for the Barden Bellas!

1785
01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:55.931
Told you. Endings
are the best part.

1786
01:43:56.009 --> 01:43:57.135
You're such a weirdo.

into a Dora the Explorer backpack,

room wearing nothing but suspenders.

But no matter.
I am in the world that I love.

of my boy, Justin...
