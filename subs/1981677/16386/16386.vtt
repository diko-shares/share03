(CHEERING INTENSIFIES)

3
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,600
Thank you, everybody.

4
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,840
Thank you.

5
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,000
Hello!

6
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,520
- Hello, peoples!
- Hello.

7
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,360
Thank you very much.

8
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,240
Thank you.

9
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,160
Thank you so much.

10
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,720
Thank you, everybody.

11
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,480
And in this show...

12
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,600
James stands in a park,

13
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,000
I panic in a shop...

14
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,560
...and Richard is touched
by a man.

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,160
(LAUGHTER)

16
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,360
All that is coming later.

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,080
It is not!

18
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,480
(LAUGHTER)

19
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,720
Yes, it is. But first,
we start with this.

20
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,960
This is the new Ford GT,

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,200
and we have had thousands
of letters from people,

22
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,840
all asking the same thing -

23
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,000
"We know it's fast, very fast,

24
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,520
but is it faster
than an airliner?"

25
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,440
Well, not thousands of letters.

26
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,000
Er... no, not thousands
of letters.

27
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,320
- You mean, none.
- Yes. We've had no letters at all.

28
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,400
But I was interested in
finding out anyway,

29
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,840
so this week, The Grand Tour
is off to New York.

30
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
And here it is.

(ENGINE REVS)

32
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,400
Deep inside the concrete
canyons of Manhattan...

33
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,320
...the fastest, most beautiful,

34
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,640
most expensive car
Ford has ever made.

35
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,800
Some are saying that it's just a
647-horsepower racing car for the road,

36
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,320
but actually,
it's a lot more than that.

37
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,760
First things first -
it is very practical.

38
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,320
It's got a boot which is
the exact same size

39
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,160
as the glove box
on a Renault Clio,

40
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,240
so you can get your luggage
in easily.

41
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,080
And unlike the previous GT,

42
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,960
it's got doors that
you can open in a car park

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,680
cos they go up rather than out.

44
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,800
And you can get inside
even if you have a head.

45
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,680
However, the seat doesn't move.

46
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,160
In order to get comfortable,
what you have to do is

47
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,520
move the steering wheel
to where you want it

48
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,920
and then you move the pedals.

49
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,440
Pull this sort of
ratchet strap here, and...

50
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,040
Right.

51
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,600
Is that... Is that fixed?

(ENGINE ROARS)

53
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,720
The problem with this
moving-pedal arrangement is

54
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,640
that when I push the brake,

55
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,960
how do I know whether
I'm applying the brakes

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,680
or just pushing the pedal
further away?

57
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,960
How do I know
whether it's locked?

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,480
I don't!

59
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,600

the start point of the race

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
that no one's been asking about.

64
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,560
And dressed like everyone else,

65
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,920
my rival was waiting.

66
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,640
There he is, Mr Slowly.

67
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,280
- Morning.
- (GRUNTS) Hang on.

68
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,320
Right, what's the plan?

69
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,120
Well, we're going to find out

70
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,880
whether it's faster
to fly or drive

71
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,200
from here
to the Canadian border.

72
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,680
- Fly.
- Well, you say that,

73
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,080
- but if you look on a map...
- (MOUTHS SILENTLY)

...you, because you're not
using a car,

75
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,080
will have to go from here
in Central Park

76
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,000
on a train to JFK,
then fly to Buffalo

77
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,520
and then use a bus
to get to the finish line

78
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,960
at the Niagara Falls, where
I'll be waiting for you.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,920
You won't be waiting for me.

80
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,400
I will. This thing does
216 miles an hour!

81
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,880
Yes, I know, but where,
between there and there,

82
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,200
are you gonna do
216 miles an hour?

83
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,880
Yes, but you've got to spend two hours
at JFK being touched inappropriately

84
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,480
and giving them your toothpaste.

85
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,080
Anyway, you've got a handicap.

86
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,920
- What handicap?
- Here it is!

88
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,160
Seriously?
I thought he was in hospital.

89
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,600
No, you mean you hoped he was
in hospital, but he isn't!

90
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,200
He's come all the way out here.

91
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,400
He's keen to get back to work.

92
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,800
So I've become a carer,
is that what you're saying?

93
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,400
Yes. Morning, Hammond.

94
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,560
- Morning, chaps! How are you?
- We're very well.

95
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,840
You do know this is
a race car, don't you?

96
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,320
Yes, apart from the fact it's got
indicators and a rear-view mirror and...

97
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,120
Yeah, but it was built
to go racing,

98
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,760
and you do know racing cars
never work on the road.

99
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,280
After an hour in this, you'll
be scared you're gonna to die.

100
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,640
After two hours, you'll be
scared in case you don't die.

101
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,440
Shall we just get on with this?

- Yes!

105
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,240
- Nothing, nothing.
- That looks tremendous!

106
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,120
I've got it up again now.
That was in its V-Max mode.

00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,560
Right. Ready, steady...

108
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,080

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,840
Go.

He hasn't got a chance, has he?

00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,000
He has if you just
stand there. Let's go!

the car and public transport,

as they get a card,
most people just do it.

Finally, I'd been caught
at a red light,

138
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,960

an important call to make.

You have a James May

Sure. Do you have their confirmation number,
and can you spell their last names?

144
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,640
I don't have
a confirmation number.

145
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,840
What I can tell you is that they've
been accidentally booked by the office

146

into business class.

147
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,720
That's not company policy, so could
you drop them back down to economy?

148
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,440
Sure, let me take a look.

149
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,360
OK, I will make this update
in their reservation

150
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
and we will email you
a confirmation.

we can help with?

JAMES: Come on!

158
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,760
With the world's clumsiest
driver stuck in a barrier...

159
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,400
...I was getting used to
the monster

160
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,960
that was powering me
through Manhattan.

161
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,320
I used to own the old Ford GT,

162
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,920
and that was a brilliant car
in every way

163
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,200
apart from the fact that it was
the size of a football pitch,

164
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,400
I knocked myself out
every time I closed the door,

165
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,880
I couldn't see
what was coming at junctions,

166
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,440
and it had
such a small fuel tank

167
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,760
that it could only go about
six yards between fill-ups.

168
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,040
This new version, however,
is completely different.

169
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,720
It is longer than
the car I had, and wider

170
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,880
and harder to see out of,
and incredibly,

171
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,560
the fuel tank's even smaller.

172
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,640
It only holds 12 gallons.

173
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,240
And that means that
on this 420-mile race,

174
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,400
I'm gonna have
to fill up... twice.

175
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,840
Eek.

176
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,520
It also has literally the hardest
ride of any car I've ever driven.

177
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,120
I know New York's roads are
atrocious, but this is stiff.

This is... This is
stiffer than Ron Jeremy.

down the stairs,

already leaving Manhattan.

Right, we've got to go across
the Georgy Washington Bridge.

Annoyingly though,
my storming progress

189

by roadworks.

(BEEPING HORNS)

I thought it was going to be.

Nothing, don't worry.

- What?
- Nothing.

Yeah, but it means both of
them, not just this one.

Come and see the man without a
disability sitting in the special seat!

- Ow!
- There's nobody else disabled down here.

199
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,160
I'd be better if I could sit in that
special seat that's reserved for me.

It's reserved for
disabled people.

- Like me!
- You're not disabled!

Temporarily, yes, I am!

You're not disabled, you've
had a playground injury

There always is, of course, cos they're
seen as sort of blue-collar heroes.

That said, this one is $400,000.

You can actually have two Ferraris
for the price of one of these. Two!

212
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,760
Meanwhile, Hammond was heading
for the next subway train

of Captain Compassionate.

That's gone, then. Yeah.

217
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,760
What happened there is,
basically, we missed the train

218
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,040
because you don't know to slow down
when it says "finish" across the road.

what happened.

JEREMY: I, meanwhile,
was off the bridge,

222
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,840
and at last the GT had some
space to stretch its legs.

223
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,320
Right, now, the roads are
opening up a bit,

224

00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,160
What an astonishing engine!

231
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,640
It's a turbo-charged V6,
not a V8,

232
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,080
which it should be in a Ford GT,

233
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,880
and it shares 60% of its components with
the engine in a Ford pick-up truck.

234
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:25,240
Yet somehow, it feels
like a mad Caterham

00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,640

around with the sound this engine makes.

himself in New Jersey,

I was falling even more
under the spell of the GT.

267
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,160
This car was actually developed

268
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,160
by a team of just 20 people,

269
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,680
and they did it under the
radar of Ford's management.

270
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,760
They had no idea
it was going on.

271
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,760
Their only contribution to it
was insisting it had

272
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,960
a little sort of glove-box thing
down here in front of the seat

273
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,440
so that when they were testing
it on the streets of Detroit,

274
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,880
they had somewhere
to store their Glocks.

275
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,280
And it does actually feel like it
was put together by a small team.

276
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,840
It doesn't feel like the product
of a mass-market manufacturer.

277

There's nothing subtle or damped
or gentle about anything it does.

this was going?

going faster than the cars.

a James May talking book
on how to mend things.

296
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,840
JAMES (NARRATING): What I didn't
appreciate at the age of five

297
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,560
was the facility that the
freshly wound mainspring had

298
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,840
for completing the
disassembly process for me,

299
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,360

at that. It was there...

- Yeah, that's all right.
- Cool.

know how you've put up with it.

How did he stay awake
to read that out?

He's reassembling
an alarm clock,

an audio book of it.

You were complaining. I didn't
think you wanted them any more.

- You gave them away!
- You're in a wheelchair.

don't go, "I'm not using that".

343
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,720
Sitrep - 300 miles to go,

344
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,360
and I've been doing
16.4 miles to the gallon,

345
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,520
and I'm on the motorway.

346
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,040
That's not bad. I mean, it's
not a prize, but it's not bad.

347
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,880
They should be at JFK now
having their penises touched

348
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,560
and deodorant confiscated.

349
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,520
I'm gonna go up and down, OK?

350
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,200
I'm going down.

351
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,360
I'll go up and down one more
time at the top of the leg.

352
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,800
JEREMY: At this point,

353
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,680
I decided to make life even
worse for Hammond and May

354
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,520
by making another call
to their airline.

355
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,600
CUSTOMER-SERVICE REP: Thank you for
calling JetBlue. How may I help you?

356
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,960
Really sorry to trouble you again.
It's Jeremy Clarkson here.

357
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,720
I spoke earlier about

358
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,480
downgrading Mr May and
Mr Hammond to economy class.

359
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,680
- Yeah.
- If I could tell you,

360
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,280
in confidence - they've both
just come out of rehab.

361
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,840
So on the flight,
could you make sure

362
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,400
the attendants don't
give them any alcohol?

363
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,720
Thank you for letting us know.

364
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,360
I will go onto the
reservation and make a note

365
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,320
and give it
to our in-flight crew.

366
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,680
We will make sure to accommodate
this special request.

367
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,800
Thank you
for your understanding.

368
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,680
OK, goodbye.

369
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,680
PHONE COMPUTER: Calling Vagina.

370
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,280
- (PHONE RINGS)
- Hold on.

371
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,200
- Hello?
- Where are you?

372
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,240
We're at JFK.
How far have you got?

373
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,560
I've done 153 miles.

374
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,160
- 153?
- Yeah.

375
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,480
Right, well,
this is where we catch up.

376
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,840
We're about to board
the 500mph shuttle.

377
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,400
How long's your flight?

378
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,080
One hour and 15 minutes.

379
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,800
Righty-ho. I could literally...

380
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,720
I might stop
and have lunch in a minute.

381
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll see you at the end

382
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,600
and keep a beer warm for you.

383
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,960
You definitely will need a drink if
you get to the end, I assure you.

384
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,880
Got to go now - important work.

385
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,000
- Goodbye.
- (LAUGHS)

386
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,400
Economy and no drinks!

387
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,800
I am so gonna win this today.

388
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,560
JEREMY: Calls over,
I put my foot down

389
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,960
and went back
into the noise zone.

390
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,800
(ENGINE ROARS)

391
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,960
(CHEERING)

392
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,240
Honestly...

393
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,480
...you would not believe,

394
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,320
you simply wouldn't believe the
noise that that car makes.

395
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,160
It's just...
It's just so relentless.

396
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,400
I can't imagine having to put up
with that endless bellowing drone.

397
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,200
Yeah, it's a dreary drone.

398
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,320
Just going on and on
and on and on.

399
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,560
You think you had it bad, I was
travelling with a handicap!

400
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,680
(LAUGHTER)

401
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,080
James, it's not 1950. The correct
term these days is "a disabled".

402
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,440
He's not disabled,
he's just clumsy.

403
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,960
What?

404
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,600
Actually, on that whole point,

405
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,200
able-bodied people
like to think that

406
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,280
everything that could be done
to make life easier

407
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,640
and convenient for disabled
people has been done,

408
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,560
but when you find yourself
in that position,

409
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,520
you realise it really,
really hasn't.

410
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,920
The Grand Tour -
a show that cares.

411
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,400
(LAUGHTER)

412
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,840
This week it's disabled people

413
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,440
and next week we're doing
people who are BLT.

414
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,040
Erm... that's a sandwich.

415
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,320
What is it I mean?

416
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,960
You mean, LGBT.

417
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,520
Yes, that.

418
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,040
That's what I meant, not BLT.
Er... anyway...

419
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,960
It's lesbian, gay, bacon
and tomato - that's the one.

420
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,400
That's my favourite sandwich,
and we're doing that next week.

421
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,840
Later on, though,
we'll be picking the race up,

422
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,400
so don't go away.

423
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,920
Absolutely, there'll be
more of that later.

424
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,800
But now it is time for us
to lean

425
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,640
on the lamppost of chat,
in Conversation Street.

426
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,520
(LIVELY JAZZ)

427
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,400
(LAUGHTER)

428
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,800
Right, yes, now -
Formula One season is over,

429
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,800
and as we all know, I'm sure,

430
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
Lewis Hamilton is
world champion,

431
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,040
and well done, him.

432
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,000
I think we all agree on that.

433
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm sure the Baby Jesus
was very pleased.

434
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,520
- I don't doubt it.
- They're like that.

435
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,040
They're close.

436
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,840
For me though, the highlight
of the entire season

437
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,160
was on the podium in Mexico,

438
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,160
where Kimi Raikkonen set what
I think is a new world record

439
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,000
for the longest
chug of champagne.

440
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,760
- Did he?
- Honestly.

441
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,720
Everyone else is
spraying it round.

442
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,240
Back of shot... (GULPS)

443
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,200
I thought, "I know
the Finns like a drink,

444
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,200
but he must have
a titanium throat!"

445
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,080
Imagine the burp he did
afterwards, a whole bottle.

446
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,600
It's staggering.

447
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,760
I think the problem is
for most people,

448
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,120
champagne on the podium
is a ritual,

449
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,560
but for Kimi Raikkonen,
it's just another drink,

450
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,640
and he hasn't had one
for at least two hours.

451
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,440
I often wonder - you know
in Abu Dhabi, on the podium,

452
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,560
they're given rose water,
not champagne?

453
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,120
If Kimi's coming 3rd,
he's thinking,

454
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,080
"I've got to go on the podium for
20 minutes and drink rose water."

455
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,400
(REVS DOWN) "Oh, no, I'm 4th.

456
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,320
Straight to my motorhome
and have a beer".

457
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,400
- Tuck in!
- I mean, he is a Finn!

458
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,200
That's what they do.

459
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,960
Anyway, self-driving cars.
We're told they're coming.

460
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,120
- Yes.
- We were told this week,

461
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,920
actually,
that there's a problem.

462
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,360
In cities like New York, and I guess
other cities around the world,

463
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,280
people who drive them,
indeed the cars themselves,

464
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,800
are going to be bullied.

465
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,960
- Bullied?
- That's what they're saying.

466
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,520
Obviously, these cars will be programmed
to never run over a person, OK?

467
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,400
Which means you can just go
and stand in front of them.

468
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,160
I mean, you could.

469
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,720
You could do better than that, you
could probably herd them a bit.

470
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,720
I could herd them
and I would herd them.

471
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,120
Can you imagine
how sanctimonious

472
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,920
the man sitting in his new self-driving
car is gonna be with his paper?

473
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,720
"I'm not driving, I'm just reading
the paper while it drives me home."

474
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,440
If you just go, "Back up!"

475
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,760
It'll be going,
"I mustn't run him over!"

476
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,480
Back him into a river.
That's what I'd do, I would.

477
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,640
They'll have all those
algorithms on board

478
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,160
for moral decisions as to
what they're gonna do.

479
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,720
- So carry a fake baby.
- Good plan!

480
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,720
Walk up to it,
the car will think,

481
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,240
"Fake baby or fat, smug man
in a business suit?"

482
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,200
- He's going in the river.
- This is exactly right.

483
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,000
That would be tremendous.

484
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,040
Sadly, I don't think we're
going to see anything like

485
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,200
an autonomous car
until long after we're dead.

486
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,880
No, I couldn't
agree with you more.

487
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,360
They are years and years and
years away, decades away.

488
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,600
It's such a complicated area to
apply what is essentially robotics.

489
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,400
You're dead right
about robotics.

490
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,840
I don't yet have a robot that
could make me a cup of tea,

491
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,160
which is quite simple,
or bring me my slippers.

492
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,480
- Just domestic stuff.
- Sex robots aren't here yet.

493
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,120
That's people from Essex,
isn't it?

494
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,840
(LAUGHTER)

495
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,880
There's a TV show about that,
isn't there?

496
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,800
- Anyone from Essex?
- Orange Sex...

497
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,040
You're from Essex? There's
a sex robot here, look.

498
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,760
RICHARD: Hiya!

499
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,160
That's what he thinks of you.
I don't, personally.

500
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,640
That's amazing.
It's incredibly convincing!

501
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,760
Can you go like that...

502
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,200
Can we stop this conversation?
It's gonna go somewhere wrong.

503
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,520
The way I'd sum this up is this.

504
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,320
Somebody says, "We've made this
self-driving car, brilliant."

505
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,040
I will take him to Bolivia, put
him at the bottom of Death Road

506
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,640
and say, "Sit in it,
reading your paper

507
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,920
while it drives you up there, passing
all the buses with the 1,000-foot drop.

508
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,640
If you're prepared to do that
and you can reach the top

509
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,200
with no poo in your
underpants, I'll buy one."

510
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,800
"Enjoy reading your newspaper on the way".
It's not gonna work.

511
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,240
No, right - "Agh!"

512
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,280
That's covered
self-driving cars.

513
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,520
We needn't worry.
Shall we move it on?

514
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,040
Yes. Moving on.
Interesting news this week -

515
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,520
Jeremy has been approached
to be the ambassador...

516
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,200
- Oh, yeah!
- ...for a vineyard

517
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,600
- in the South of France.
- Yes, I have.

518
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,960
What are they thinking?

519
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,120
Imagine a better job than that.

520
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,600
Oh, yeah. "I am the Ambassador
for Chateau (MUTTERS)."

521
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,960
How's that going to go?
"Where is the Ambassador?"

522
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,760
"He's out the back,
completely clattered,

523
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,360
where he always is."

524
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,360
You're not an ambassador,
you're a customer!

525
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,480
Sorry - he's out the back
with pneumonia.

526
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,320
- Ambassadorial pneumonia.
- Still droning on about that?

527
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,120
I don't know how it's going to
work though, cos the problem is,

528
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,280
the three of us have never
had a commercial tie-in.

529
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,160
You may be surprised to hear
this - we dress ourselves.

530
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,080
(LAUGHTER)

531
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,240
No, he doesn't mean we
put our clothes on ourselves.

532
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,760
We're not sponsored by
a clothing company.

533
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,520
I know you'll be staggered
to hear that.

534
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,240
- Model's own.
- Yes, this is it.

535
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,280
I go into a shop and I
choose these and I buy them

536
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,120
with my money,
watches and everything.

537
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,000
We buy everything ourselves.

538
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,640
That's why we don't know how it
works, the commercial stuff.

539
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,600
Actually, it's funny
you should mention that,

540
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,280
because you know that
pink-and-purple-striped

541
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,360
rugby-shirt thing
I've had for years?

542
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,440
- Yeah.
- You know the one I mean.

543
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,640
- It's a top.
- I know, yeah. Top?

544
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,160
- It's a top.
- Did you say, "top"?

545
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,480
- It's a top.
- It's not a top!

546
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,840
It's not a shirt,
it's not a T-shirt.

547
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,360
Hammond, I've never said this before
and I promise I'll never say it again,

548
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,240
but I'm with James May on this.

549
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,840
- A man cannot wear a "top".
- Ordinarily, no,

550
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,160
but that is... Technically,
it's a hooped top.

551
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,440
Anyway, that's not the point.
I was at an event once,

552
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,160
and a man sidled up to me,
took me to one side.

553
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,080
He was from Gant, the big
American clothing company

554
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,880
- that made that thing originally, the shirt!
- Top.

555
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,120
He begged me, he said,
"Please stop wearing it."

556
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,720
And then...

557
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,080
It got better than that.

558
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,840
He says,
"If you stop wearing it,

559
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,320
you can have as many
free clothes as you like."

560
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,960
But I still said no
because I'm an arse.

561
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,480
(LAUGHTER)

562
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:56,440
Hey! What about...
Why don't we do...

563
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,520
- What?
- Reverse sponsorship.

564
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,560
It's just occurring to me.

565
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,920
You know Levi's once said I'm
ruining the Levi reputation?

566
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,760
- They did!
- Because I always wear Levi's.

567
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,960
Why don't I say to them,
"Give me 100 grand,

568
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,600
I'll wear Rounders"?

569
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,840
- Erm...
- What about watches?

570
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,880
I'm going to sit like this,

571
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,800
and I'm going to say
something deeply offensive

572
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,200
to millions of people
around the world, Omega!

573
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,120
(LAUGHTER)

574
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,360
Unless you send me 50 grand,
and I'll wear a Rolex,

575
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,320
which is the watch of choice
for all the world's arses.

576
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,320
I'm not a lawyer...

577
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,800
- Mm-hm?
- ...but isn't that extortion?

578
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,280
It is extortion.

579
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,880
It just is.

580
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,520
I've got a better idea.

581
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,200
Why don't we say to people,
they can put in bids

582
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,480
to put their logo on the bottom
of Richard Hammond's car?

583
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,840
Because the chances are...

584
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,520
(LAUGHTER)

585
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,040
Yes!

586
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,400
Thank you!

587
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,360
- Thank you.
- Imagine the commentary.

588
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,480
"Here comes Richard Hammond.
Oh, no, he's gone off! Pepsi".

589
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,400
(LAUGHTER)

590
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,360
- That's a very good idea.
- Moving on.

591
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,920
That's the end
of Conversation Street.

592
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,720
We must move it on with this.

593
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,040
Imagine what it's like
to be a car designer.

594
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,120
You love cars, you always have.

595
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,320
Your school exercise books
were full of drawings of cars.

596
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,960
You worked hard,
you got to college,

597
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,520
learned about geometry
and proportions

598
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,600
and classicism and airflow
and legislation.

599
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,480
Then one day
you get your qualification,

600
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,160
and you land your dream job
somewhere like Mercedes-Benz.

601
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,440
And you spend
your first four years

602
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:36,040
designing the new seat-belt release
button for the A-Class hatchback.

603
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,640
Exactly, or a tailgate handle
for a van. Ooh!

604
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,720
It's not exactly what
they dreamed of as kids,

605
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,320
is it, car designers?

606
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,360
Which is why they
occasionally get bolshie

607
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,080
and they say to the management,

608
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,640
"Look, would you please let
us do something interesting?"

609
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:56,360
And that is obviously what's
happened with the new Mercedes GT R.

610
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,240
(ENGINE ROARS)

611
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,480
You just know the designers
have said, "Can it be green

612
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,520
and can it have a mouth that
could be used for sifting krill

613
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,640
and can the bonnet
be nine miles long

614
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,520
and can it have bits of the
Battlestar Galactica on its gills?"

615
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,520
The bosses obviously thought,
"They're being idiotic."

616
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,400
But to keep them sweet,
they let them get on with it.

617
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,800
The upshot is a car
that only really appeals

618
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,760
to those that have
a mental age of eight,

619
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,320
and that's me
and every other man.

620
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,680
It even makes a childish noise.

621
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
- (RUMBLES)
- (LAUGHS)

622
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,720
Just brilliant!

623
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,640
Unfortunately however,

624
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,120
because the stylists were
allowed to do what they wanted,

625
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,400
the engineers then
stuck out their bottom lips

626
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,960
and said they wanted
a free hand too.

627
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,040
The trouble is that
unlike car stylists,

628
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,040
who are flamboyant
and usually drunk,

629
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,280
car engineers
tend to be very sensible.

630
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,560
You can tell this just by
looking at their trousers.

631
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,600
So they fitted this with
all sorts of sensible stuff.

632
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,280
It's got a flap, for example,
which lowers itself

633
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,880
from the bottom of the car
when you're going quickly

634
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,960
to reduce the air pressure
down there.

635
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,040
That literally sucks the car
into the Tarmac,

636
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,080
giving you more grip.

637
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,440
Then there's
the traction control,

638
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,080
which you can turn off
using this button here.

639
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,000
Then you can decide how off
you'd like it to be

640
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,640
using this piece of Lego here.

641
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,160
You turn it that way, and
it's really very off indeed.

642
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:15,000
Then you swivel it round, and
now it's only slightly off.

643
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,360
I never knew "off"
was a variable thing,

644
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,720
but there you go.

645
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,840
Other things - well, the body
is made from carbon fibre

646
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:31,400
and titanium and magnesium
to make it light.

647
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,720
And it's got two
Venturi tunnels at the back

648
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,600
and short gearing
and four-wheel steering.

649
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,880
There's so much techy stuff
on the GT R, in fact,

650
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,280
that it is really...

651
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,200
(LAUGHS) ...very fast

652
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,760
and extremely well sorted out.

653
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,480
The turning, thanks to
the four-wheel steering,

654
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,040
is incredible,
and when you go through

655
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,240
Dentalcare Swindon,
run by dentists for patients,

656
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,640
it's like a small
and very eager dog.

657
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,520
Then you've got the gearbox,

658
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,520
which I think was designed by
Mystic Meg

659
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,760
because it always seems to know

660
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,080
what's going to happen next.

661
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,240
It is uncanny!

662
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,000
But the best thing is
the braking. You ready?

663
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,000
Watch this.

664
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,600
Has my face actually
come off? It has, hasn't it?

665
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,320
Small wonder, then, that
the GT R holds the lap record

666
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,440
for rear-wheel drive cars
at the Nurburgring,

667
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,400
and that is its problem.

668
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,720
Because AMG Mercs aren't really
supposed to set lap records.

669
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,160
They're not supposed to be
particularly fast.

670
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,360
You buy an AMG Merc
cos you want it to do this...

671
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
...make a lot of noise

672
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,880
while sliding through a
cloud of its own tyre smoke.

673
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,640
In an AMG Merc,

674
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,040
you don't want to go round
a corner crisply at 150,

675
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:38,760
you want to go round smiling
and sideways at about 27.

676
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,880
And there's another thing too...

677
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,960
...the engine.

678
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,840
It's a twin turbo-charged V8,

679
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,760
which produces 577
horsepower, and that's a lot.

680
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,800
But exactly the same engine
in an E-Class saloon

681
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,320
produces
more than 600 horsepower.

682
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,200
So why not use that engine
in here?

683
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,080
The only possible reason
is that soon,

684
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,360
there'll be a more powerful,

685
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
even faster version of this car,

686
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,880
so why buy this one now?

687
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,160
It's a good question.

688
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,080
I wouldn't.

689
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,520
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

690
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,080
So, who would buy a car
like that?

691
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,040
I don't know,
I've never met anyone

692
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,040
who I think would like that
car, would want to buy it.

693
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,840
Besides all that,
if you want something

694
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,560
that feels like a Porsche,
why not buy, say, a Porsche?

695
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,080
Because Porsche are really
good at making Porsches.

696
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,400
- RICHARD: They are.
- Yeah.

697
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,800
They're so good
at making Porsches

698
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,360
that since you filmed that,
their new GT2

699
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,920
has gone round the Nurburgring

700
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,080
faster than the GTR.

701
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,840
The worst thing is,

702
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,920
that's the first time I've
ever filmed an AMG Merc

703
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,200
and finished the day

704
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,880
on the same set of tyres
I started with.

705
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,560
And I don't like that.

706
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,920
I want an AMG Merc to eat
its own feet in every corner.

707
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,600
That's what it's for, yes.

708
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,400
Anyway, if you are
the sort of person

709
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,520
who wants to buy
a shouty, lime green car

710
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,240
that looks mad
but actually isn't,

711
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,520
then you'll probably
want to know

712
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,040
how fast it goes around
our Eboladrome.

713
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,800
Yeah. Last year,
that would have meant

714
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,640
handing it over to the American.

715
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,640
But we're not using him
any more,

716
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,680
because he didn't like
coming to England.

717
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,720
And because you all hated him.

718
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,520
(CHEERING)

719
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,320
- Well, that too.
- Little bit.

720
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,440
But the point is,
we needed a replacement,

721
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,000
we needed a new driver.

722
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,800
And we've spent
the last nine months

723
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,840
auditioning everyone
we could think of.

724
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,280
Former F1 drivers,

725
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,320
rally drivers, stunt drivers,
test drivers,

726
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,320
until we ended up
with the fastest.

727
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,840
And here she is.

728
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,640
Right, here we go.

729
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,760
JEREMY: And she's off.
Tidy start, no wheelspin,

730
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,520
full power
from the twin-turbo V8.

731
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,880
To the first corner.
Will she lift?

732
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,000
No, it didn't sound like
she did.

733
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,680
Right, second corner,
balancing the car nicely.

734
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,760
God, that thing looks planted.

735
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,640
Right, here we go,
this is the tricky bit.

736
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,840
Let's have a look how she's
getting on round here.

737
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,960
Ooh, that thing looks planted!

738
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,600
And quick.

739
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,560
She's on the raggedy edge
on the down-changes.

740
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,040
(TYRES SQUEAL)

741
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,240
Michelins squealing in pain,
but that is...

742
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,240
Let's have a look.
Yeah, inch-perfect.

743
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,040
Now, back onto the Isn't.

744
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,960
She really has only one
throttle position here,

745
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,280
and it is in the carpet.

746
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,560
Lifting now, and into the
Old Lady's House complex.

747
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,000
Working the low-speed grip
through there.

748
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:53,280
Yeah, and back on the gas for
the bumpy run to Substation.

749
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,920
Showing no mercy down there.

750
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,160
Leaving the braking
nice and late.

751
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,320
Tidy line through
the second-to-last corner.

752
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,960
Just Field of Sheep to go.

753
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,720
Really on it through there,
and across the line.

754
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,040
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

755
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,240
That was an impressive lap,

756
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,640
but let's see how fast it was.

757
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,160
Here we go.

758
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,800
Past the... Oh, it's quicker.

759
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,040
- Yes!
- (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

760
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,880
Bloody hell!

761
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,400
1:18.7. That is quick.

762
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,840
Yeah, it is, and she is
an incredible driver.

763
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,120
She's a phenomenal driver,
absolutely phenomenal.

764
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,880
We are delighted
to have her on board.

765
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,040
But now it is time to move on
to Celebrity Face-Off.

766
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,960
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

767
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Yes. And once again
it is an international event

768
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,800
as baseball takes on cricket.

769
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,960
In short,
we're trying to find out

770
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,800
who is the fastest person
in the world

771
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,400
who earns a living from throwing
and catching small balls.

772
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,320
So would you please welcome

773
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,600
Kevin Pietersen
and Brian Wilson.

774
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,080
(APPLAUSE)

775
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,480
JEREMY: Gentlemen!

776
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,560
Hello, sir.

777
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,720
- Kevin, how are you?
- Good.

778
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,400
Good. Have a seat.

779
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,160
Brian. Good to see you.

780
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,400
That is a look!

781
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,000
That is a look
you've got going there.

782
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,000
First of all, thank you
very much for coming.

783
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,400
Thanks for having us.

784
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,120
And let's begin
with a simple one, OK?

785
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,600
Actually, it's not that simple.

786
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,200
Kevin, could you explain
to our American viewers

787
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,840
what cricket is?

788
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,000
I think I'm very lucky,
we've got...

789
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,240
I'm bored already actually!

790
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,440
- No, go on, have another bash.
- No.

791
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,920
Just cos I don't like it
and it gives me hay fever.

792
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,440
Go on.

793
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,840
Yeah, it's very difficult.
For American...

794
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,960
I play a lot of golf with
a lot of American people

795
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,760
and they literally,
after two minutes,

796
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,680
tell me to go away,
swearing at me,

797
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,680
because how can you play a game for
five days and not get a result?

798
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,360
But there's T20s
that Brian knows about,

799
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,880
he's been to India,
he's played T20s in India,

800
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,440
and it's a pretty cool game.

801
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,000
- I reckon you could do a T20.
- No, I couldn't.

802
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,600
With cricket, you stand there
in the outfield,

803
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,120
the ball,
super-heated from re-entry,

804
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,040
is coming, "Ah, ah, ah,"

805
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,640
and then it always lands
right on the end of your...

806
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,680
- "Gah!"
- That finger?

807
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,880
- Yeah, and everyone shouts.
- That's convenient.

808
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,600
Everybody shouts,
and you drop the ball,

809
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,800
and you're batting
and some enormous man...

810
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,320
It's miserable, it goes on,
as you say, five days.

811
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,240
Actually, before we move on,

812
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,640
perhaps you could explain
to the British viewers

813
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,360
what baseball is.

814
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,600
It's not much more exciting.

815
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,400
- JEREMY: I've seen...
- It's a little faster.

816
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,880
I've seen clips of it in films,

817
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,880
like Good Will Hunting,
there's a scene of it.

818
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,200
It's rounders.

819
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,480
- Now, I just learned...
- It is rounders, isn't it?

820
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,400
I just learned
what rounders was today,

821
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,160
and in all fairness,
no, no, it's not like that.

822
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,400
Men play this sport as well.

823
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,080
Can you be drunk
while playing baseball?

824
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,600
- You can be, I guess, yeah.
- Cos you are...

825
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,200
Everyone is in cricket,
I presume.

826
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,680
We're all piss-heads.
Cricketers are piss-heads.

827
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,280
The great celebrated cricketers,

828
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,720
the Flintoffs, the Warnes,
piss-heads.

829
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,440
- BRIAN: Piss-heads?
- Piss-heads, yeah.

830
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,520
- JEREMY: It's OK.
- You can say that?

831
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,760
Or as we call them, ambassadors.

832
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,640
With pneumonia.
That's what it is.

833
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,960
I was astonished
to read the other day

834
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,640
about the England
cricket team and how...

835
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,640
Actually, the Australian
cricket team as well,

836
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,400
I presume it's the same
in South Africa,

837
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,400
is how much drinking went on
at the "tea break".

838
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,960
Yeah. There's a world record

839
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,480
for the amount of alcohol
consumed on an aeroplane

840
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,280
by a cricketer from Australia
for the Ashes,

841
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,440
and there was an Australian
cricketer drank 52 beers

842
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,320
on his way over from Australia.

843
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,960
That's aggressive.
That's aggressive.

844
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,440
That's a big amount.

845
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,480
- That's a big amount.
- That's a lot of drunk.

846
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,520
Now, we must move
on to cars, if we may,

847
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,520
- having covered the sport.
- Sure.

848
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,160
Maybe begin with you, Brian, OK?

849
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,960
You had,
I think it's fair to say,

850
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,680
an inauspicious start
to your driving career.

851
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,560
It wasn't the best start, no.

852
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,840
So, 16, got my licence.

853
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,440
First day, I got a speeding
ticket, that was expected.

854
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,600
Second day, though,
it's about 1am,

855
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,840
apparently we have a curfew
I didn't know about,

856
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,920
you have to be in bed
by a certain time.

857
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,040
As a 16-year-old,
I'm thinking, "No, I don't."

858
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,680
So I rolled through
the stop sign,

859
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,760
and I see the blue lights,
and I'm thinking,

860
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,000
"I'm in a '94 Thunderbird,
this is a V8 engine."

861
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,800
So I speed.

862
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,440
Now I'm getting
in a police chase.

863
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,480
- Now the adrenaline's going.
- Second day?

864
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,840
BRIAN: The second day.

865
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,560
I'm driving around
my neighbourhood,

866
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,480
and I accidentally hit
an electrical box

867
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,880
and the power goes out
and I feel really bad.

868
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,960
But I left this guy in the dust.

869
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Like, I got all the way
to my driveway.

870
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,720
But because
I turned the keys off...

871
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,360
The car was automatic lights.

872
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,720
So the cop
just followed the lights

873
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,360
and arrested me in my
driveway, my front yard.

874
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,560
And so what do you get
for that, for...

875
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,760
What do you get? You get to go
to jail, you get a free ride.

876
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,120
And I'm amazed
they pull you over,

877
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,160
cos you look like
an accountant, I mean...

878
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,120
This is a slow Tuesday.
See me on the weekends!

879
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,440
So, Kevin, your first car
was a Nissan...

880
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,440
- Pulsar.
- Which is a bit boring.

881
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,880
It's not as good as his
V8 Thunderbird, is it?

882
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,880
It is boring, apart from
a couple of gadgets.

883
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,120
I got a couple of gadgets

884
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,160
that were put in
by my late grandfather.

885
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,600
And in South Africa, the
crime rate's pretty severe,

886
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,760
so there was a switch he had
put underneath the ignition

887
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,840
you had to flip before
you could turn the car.

888
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,080
If you didn't flip it
within 20 seconds, the car...

889
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,760
Would explode, killing
everybody within 40 yards.

890
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,320
- That's safe!
- The South African way.

891
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,920
There was another one,

892
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,800
every time you put it into
reverse, "Doo, doo, doo."

893
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,960
I'm a cool 18-year-old
driving around Durban,

894
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,760
I put it in reverse, everyone goes,
"Where's the (BLEEP) truck?"

895
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,160
It was a little red
Nissan Pulsar,

896
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,920
"Doo, doo, doo, doo," out of it.

897
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,400
So really, you're basically
a slightly more wild driver.

898
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,960
Did you not buy a police car
at one stage?

899
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,960
I did have a police car.

900
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,760
And I did get
pulled over in that. So...

901
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,120
Again, why would you
get pulled over?

902
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,800
It wasn't my fault, though.

903
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,440
They said I was trying to
impersonate a police officer,

904
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,800
which I wasn't, it was just
a cool car to drive in.

905
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,560
I may have pulled a friend
over as a joke.

906
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,880
- But who wouldn't?
- Did you have sirens and all?

907
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:33,880
Yeah, you have sirens.

908
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,080
Have you ever gone anywhere
in a car

909
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,880
and not been pulled over
by the police?

910
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,080
Just thinking, going back
to the sporting thing,

911
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,400
when you played cricket
briefly in India,

912
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,600
you managed to get
into trouble with that one.

913
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,480
- Yeah, and felt really bad.
- Really?

914
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,800
So, well, where I was,
it was just a large field

915
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,800
and there might have been
100 games going on,

916
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,360
all the kids
from around local playing,

917
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,040
and they said,
"Hey, you wanna try?"

918
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,160
So no one tells me
any of these rules,

919
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,520
so there's these three little...

920
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,480
- What do you call, wickets?
- Wickets.

921
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,840
- Stumps.
- "OK, what do I do?"

922
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,960
They give me this
paddle-looking thing,

923
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,200
and like, "Just stand there,

924
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,000
and then this guy's
gonna throw to you."

925
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,680
He throws it, it hits
the ground, I'm like, "What?

926
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,640
That's a bad pitch."
And it hits the wickets,

927
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,320
and all the kids start
laughing at me.

928
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,040
"What are you guys laughing
at? Give me another shot!"

929
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,000
So I stand up, pff,
just absolutely destroy it.

930
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,160
It leaves the park, it hits
an apartment building,

931
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,640
and I'm just like,
"I'm the greatest!"

932
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,840
The guy that brought me there
told me

933
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,480
that's the only ball
that they have.

934
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,560
And immediately
I just went, "Oh.

935
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,480
I feel terrible."

936
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,600
"We've had that ball in our
town for three generations."

937
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,160
- They would have.
- Treasure it.

938
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,760
Now, going back to cars,
you, at one stage,

939
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,800
as I understand it,
had a Vauxhall Vectra.

940
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,960
I did.

941
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
And you said to our researcher

942
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,920
when they called you
the other day,

943
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,760
"I have nothing particularly
interesting to say about that."

944
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,160
I've been known to be
a straight-shooter.

945
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,920
Put it there.
I once had to do a TV show

946
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,480
where I was asked
to review one of those,

947
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,320
and couldn't think of a thing.

948
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,960
It was four wheels
and a (BLEEP) seat.

949
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,400
Why did you have one?

950
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,880
The team were sponsored
by Vauxhall.

951
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,640
You were sponsored by Vauxhall?

952
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,280
Oh, I'd have gone and done
another sport.

953
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,360
Now, we must get
on to why you are here.

954
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,720
Obviously, you're only the second group
of people we've had around the track.

955
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,520
- How was it out there?
- It was...

956
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,960
I found it comfortable
on the tar,

957
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,920
but as soon as we veered
off there, it was difficult.

958
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,880
- It was intimidating.
- Is it?

959
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,760
I (BLEEP) loved it!

960
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,680
There were grass clippings
all over the car,

961
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,000
I just took it off-road
a little bit, it was fun.

962
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,240
Yeah, I've been hearing.

963
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,920
We can get it mended
for next week.

964
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,760
Kevin, we're gonna see
your lap first.

965
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,200
OK, let's bring it up
and see how you got on.

966
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,040
JEREMY: Is that
a slow-motion start?

967
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,800
Oh, no, you're building up
speed as you cross the line.

968
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,440
Come on, Kevin!

969
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,280
JEREMY: Ooh, that's
a determined-looking face.

970
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,880
Clipping the corner,

971
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,200
but keeping two wheels
on the track, nice to see.

972
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,600
Yes, you've done what I do.
You brake there

973
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,160
and then you've got a slingshot

974
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,280
into what we're calling
the Difficult Bit.

975
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,640
That's when it goes
really skatey as you...

976
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,160
You've really gotta pay...

977
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,800
Ooh, I say, that's rather good.

978
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,640
For a man who grew up
with a Pulsar.

979
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,480
Kevin, you absolute numpty!

980
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,160
JEREMY: Right, oh, look at
that, it's got the tail out.

981
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,480
KEVIN: Yeah, got the tail
out, got him going good.

982
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,080
JEREMY:
Traction control saved it,

983
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,920
now you can floor it
through to Difficult Bit 2.

984
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,480
KEVIN: Oh, she's going all right.
Nicely done.

985
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,120
- That was tough.
- Yeah.

986
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,360
JEREMY: It is a tough bit.
This is really slippery

987
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,880
when you come back
on the Tarmac,

988
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,320
you think that's OK,
and it isn't.

989
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,240
Tyres being absolutely tortured,

990
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,560
that's looking nice.

991
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,040
Right, onto the straight.

992
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,320
Come on, baby! Come on, baby!

993
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,480
JEREMY: It's more exciting
than cricket, way more!

994
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,280
As is being asleep.

995
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,160
Were you flat-out through there?

996
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,200
KEVIN: I was flat-out through
there, then I messed this up.

997
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,800
JEREMY: Ooh! I'm not...

998
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,440
KEVIN: Yeah, I messed it up,
I missed the curve.

999
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,880
Ballsy flat-out through there,

1000
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,960
but you crossed the line,
you did it.

1001
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,040
(APPLAUSE)

1002
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,360
I got it. Time?

1003
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,400
So...

1004
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,600
Time?

1005
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,160
- Patience.
- Time?

1006
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,680
You're a cricketer,
we know you have patience.

1007
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,960
OK.

1008
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,880
Because what else
is there to have?

1009
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,880
- It wasn't bad.
- No, it looked OK.

1010
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,480
- Brian.
- Yes.

1011
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,680
- Want to see his lap?
- AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1012
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,120
Come on, let's see Brian's.

1013
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,360
KEVIN: Oh.

1014
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,240
JEREMY: Right, no creeping
across the line.

1015
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,160
And here we go! Yee!

1016
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,840
JEREMY: That is a colourful
comb... That's a...

1017
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,960
Cheat. He's cheating! Cheat!

1018
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,680
He's a cheat!

1019
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,200
JEREMY: It's not Formula One,

1020
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,160
we won't penalise him for
this, we have no stewards.

1021
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,480
KEVIN: Oh!

1022
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,960
JEREMY: Oh, my God!
Coming in hot!

1023
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,400
Holding it well, though,

1024
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,080
and, I must say,
that is exuberant.

1025
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,600
He's on fire!

1026
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,560
JEREMY: Into the gravel cell,
the banked gravel corner,

1027
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,600
nicely done through there.

1028
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,280
Look at those stones
coming off the back of that.

1029
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,840
Difficult Bit 2.

1030
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,960
Floor it.

1031
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
JEREMY: You don't think this is
gonna be slippery but it is.

1032
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,840
Every time, that happens.

1033
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,640
Nicely held, though, Brian.

1034
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,360
You really do get around.

1035
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,720
And there he is, onto the
main straight and relaxing.

1036
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,800
Yoo!

1037
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,600
JEREMY: Well, not
completely relaxing.

1038
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,440
Were you flat through here,
as well?

1039
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,400
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

1040
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,720
BRIAN: I took it... JEREMY:
Flat-out, that's good.

1041
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,800
Braking hard.

1042
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,160
Not bad at all.

1043
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,320
And there we are, across the
line, that's both of them.

1044
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,040
(APPLAUSE)

1045
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,920
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1046
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,760
Right. Now, I've got
your times here.

1047
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,680
I'll tell you one thing,
they're very, very close.

1048
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,160
So you were kind of smooth
and crickety.

1049
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,120
- Yeah.
- You were kind of exuberant.

1050
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,280
- Yeah.
- They are ridiculously close.

1051
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,200
- OK, here we go.
- The suspense.

1052
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,520
- I mean, come on.
- Yeah.

1053
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,800
- Killing me.
- OK, Kevin.

1054
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,040
- 1:17.2.
- 1:17.2?

1055
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,800
So at the moment,
you're the fastest man

1056
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,840
who's ever been round our track.

1057
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,400
- Until...
- This precise moment.

1058
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,080
Until about 30 seconds.

1059
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,960
(APPLAUSE)

1060
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,000
Brian Wilson...

1061
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,880
- Ooh.
- 1:17...

1062
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,800
- AUDIENCE: Ooh.
- Point one.

1063
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,480
- Give it to me.
- ..five.

1064
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,840
- Damn it!
- Ah!

1065
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,160
- Seriously, 0.3 of a second.
- (APPLAUSE)

1066
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,160
Well done, sir.

1067
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,560
- That's close.
- JEREMY: That is nice.

1068
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,840
That is a nice result,
I'm very pleased with that.

1069
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,960
And there we are,
you are still the fastest man

1070
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,320
who's been round our track.

1071
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,240
You have come a long way
for nothing.

1072
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,120
Thank you.

1073
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,640
- JEREMY: Literally nothing...
- Much appreciated.

1074
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,800
So, honestly, I mean
it's been an absolute joy

1075
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,120
- having you both here...
- Came here for the sheep.

1076
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,040
Yeah, no, take one home.

1077
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,200
So there we are,
ladies and gentlemen,

1078
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,520
Brian Wilson, and the fastest
person who makes a living

1079
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,880
by throwing and hitting
and catching small balls,

1080
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,320
- Kevin Pietersen!
- (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

1081
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,840
KEVIN: Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

1082
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,920
Right.

1083
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,680
Now, this week
we are having a race

1084
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,840
from Central Park in New York
to Niagara Falls,

1085
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,480
and it's Jeremy
in the new Ford GT

1086
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,160
against James and me

1087
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,520
in a whole selection
of public transport.

1088
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,200
Yes, and when
we left the action,

1089
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,640
Jeremy was miles ahead
in the car,

1090
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,240
slowly going deaf
from the drone of the engine.

1091
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,960
But now we were
about to haul him in

1092
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,160
as we boarded
the flight to Buffalo.

1093
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,840
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1094
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,240
(BANG)

1095
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,360
RICHARD: Ow! JAMES: Sorry.

1096
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,080
Get out of the way. Get out
of the way, I'm in a race.

1097
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,320
(ENGINE ROARS)

1098
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,320
Hello. Hello.

1099
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,160
Don't get in the way of someone

1100
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,680
who's just given up
a 43-year smoking habit.

1101
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,760
JEREMY: Meanwhile...

1102
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,240
JAMES: Has he got to go in that?

1103
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,160
MAN: Yes.

1104
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,840
OK, see you on board.

1105
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,560
- STEWARD: Welcome aboard.
- Hello. Thank you.

1106
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,560
Oh, God.

1107
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,560
Hello. Hello.

1108
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,360
Yeah.

1109
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,760
OK.

1110
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,000
JEREMY: Having covered
160 miles,

1111
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:14,880
the GT's tiny tank
was now nearly empty.

1112
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:20,280
This is a splash-and-dash.
Right, petroleum.

1113
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,560
Oh, please let it not be

1114
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,440
one of those stupid
American ones

1115
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,520
where I've gotta pay first,
I don't know how much I want.

1116
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,840
Sadly, it was.

1117
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,920
No. Not a debit card.

1118
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,040
I haven't got one... Ah.

1119
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,920
What?

1120
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,320
PA: All exits are marked
with a sign overhead...

1121
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,440
It's very unusual having business
class at the back, isn't it?

1122
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,720
Imagine what it's like
at the front.

1123
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,520
Must be sort of like there.

1124
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,920
It's quite good if you sit at
the back in business class,

1125
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,480
survey the whole aeroplane.

1126
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,760
This is an Embraer 190.

1127
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,640
I can tell you a bit about
these actually.

1128
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,040
PA: Prepare for departure.

1129
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,720
Oh, dear, you can't,
he's talking.

1130
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,840
JEREMY: Hello. Can I...
The pump says...

1131
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,440
It's just coming up
"not approved".

1132
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,600
Does it have a chip?
It's probably the chip.

1133
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,120
How do I pay? Cos...

1134
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,040
I'll turn the pump on,
you pump what you need

1135
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,200
and I'll let you run
the card when you're done.

1136
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,520
Thank you so much.

1137
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,360
If you talk like Hugh Grant,
you can get anywhere.

1138
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,400
Any minute now, Richard
Hammond and James May

1139
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,480
will be thinking,
"Mmm, a beer, I think."

1140
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,960
(CHUCKLES)

1141
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,960
Anyway, here we go,
let's catch him up.

1142
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,200
Definitely.

1143
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:47,200
I think we should celebrate
our progress right now,

1144
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,800
as we're moving so well.

1145
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,240
- Hello.
- Hello.

1146
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,400
- JAMES: Hi.
- Can we have beer?

1147
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,720
- Two beers, please.
- Let me see.

1148
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,520
So, as it turns out,

1149
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,400
unfortunately I won't be able
to serve you any beer today.

1150
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,360
Can I offer you a water,
Coke, Sprite?

1151
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,440
- You've got no beer?
- No, I'm sorry.

1152
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,320
Wine. Wine? Two glasses
of wine? White wine.

1153
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,960
I'm not quite too sure why,

1154
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,760
but unfortunately
I won't be able to.

1155
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,440
Can I get you
some other beverages?

1156
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,360
JEREMY: However, while they
were squashed and thirsty,

1157
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,200
there was no getting round
the fact

1158
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:23,120
that they were doing 500mph,
and I wasn't.

1159
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,000
Come on, fellow Ford driver,
get out of the way, please.

1160
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,560
You've got a Ford!

1161
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,320
We are gonna be
reeling him in now.

1162
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,360
We're not gonna get stuck
behind anything.

1163
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,560
- No.
- In traffic.

1164
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,920
No. Nobody is gonna have
a puncture.

1165
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,560
Or shed the load
from a pick-up truck.

1166
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,480
No.

1167
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,840
JEREMY: My biggest problem,
though,

1168
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:53,720
was the woeful lane discipline.

1169
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,480
And you're gonna stay in
that lane, are you, really?

1170
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,720
Undertaking.

1171
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,320
This is allowed in the
United States and America.

1172
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:10,800
You can see why. People
don't use their mirrors.

1173
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,640
It was a problem.

1174
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:16,480
And then there was a bigger one.

1175
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:20,680
What the hell's this?
I'm in a traffic jam.

1176
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,880
A bloody traffic jam. No.

1177
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,040
PA: We're about to begin
our descent

1178
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,320
into the Buffalo airport.

1179
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,000
We'll be on the ground shortly.

1180
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,360
Look.

1181
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,800
Is there a fat idiot
in a very fast Ford?

1182
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,080
- Nope.
- Good.

1183
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,840
(HORN SOUNDS)

1184
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,600
Why is there a traffic jam?
And it's a bad one.

1185
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,920
Look, we're all stopped.

1186
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:49,240
Come on. Come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

1187
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,600
Go, go, go, go, go.
Chair, please.

1188
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,040
JEREMY: Oh, shit.

1189
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,440
There we go. I'm in.

1190
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:12,280
Blimey! Yeah, that is...
I am safe.

1191
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:15,080
JEREMY: Incident.
There's been an accident.

1192
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,800
There's the problem. Jesus.

1193
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,160
We have some time to make up.

1194
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,600
Seeing an accident like that
normally slows you down,

1195
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,840
but I couldn't do that.

1196
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:32,120
I was upholding
the honour of the car.

1197
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,280
They should be landing
in about ten minutes.

1198
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,440
(PHONE RINGS)

1199
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,760
Oh, no.

1200
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,360
JEREMY: May? You've landed?

1201
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,440
- Yes! Yes.
- James, too loud. Too loud.

1202
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,640
Shit. JAMES: Where are you?

1203
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,960
I'm 130 miles from Buffalo.

1204
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,600
(LAUGHS) He's 130 miles away.

1205
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,240
Well, you better
get a move on then

1206
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,960
in your 200 and whatever
it is mile-an-hour car.

1207
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,520
I... Oh.

1208
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,040
- JEREMY: That's...
- Keep going.

1209
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,080
Oh, for God's.... Shut up.

1210
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,400
JAMES: Bye.

1211
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:08,080
Right, where do we get the bus?

1212
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:11,360
JAMES: We now only had a
couple of dozen miles to go.

1213
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,080
We'd catch a bus into Buffalo

1214
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,880
and then another
to the finish line

1215
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,360
at the Niagara Falls.

1216
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,800
Trying to think
where this went wrong.

1217
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,120
George Washington Bridge,
that didn't help.

1218
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:26,840
The accident and the traffic jam
that resulted, that didn't help.

1219
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,440
But I think the main problem

1220
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,960
is that Jet Blue managed to do

1221
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,800
an hour and 15 minute flight
in an hour.

1222
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,680
(BEEPING) RICHARD: Oh, I say.

1223
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,720
JAMES: Oh, I see,
it folds out like that?

1224
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,040
RICHARD: That's very clever.
JAMES: Here we go.

1225
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,800
RICHARD: Thank you.
JAMES: Aligned.

1226
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:47,040
- There's a wheelchair section right over there.
- Thank you very much.

1227
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,280
Come on. Yay!

1228
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:57,360
The Trump enthusiast
has pulled over!

1229
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,160
Right, let's find out
where he is.

1230

(PHONE RINGS)

1231
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:08,160
It's Mr Bell End.
Hammond, where are you?

1232
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,720
Leaving the airport on a bus.

1233
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,200
Right. Well,
I'm 90 miles behind you.

1234
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:18,440
(LAUGHS) You're gonna have
to make that up in no time.

1235
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,200
How far are you
from Niagara Falls now?

1236
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,520
23 miles.

1237
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,240
RICHARD: I'd say
you could be doomed.

1238
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,320
Good luck,
we're getting closer. Bye.

1239
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,280
He's never gonna do it.

1240
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:38,480
Oh! I don't want this car
to lose, I properly love it.

1241
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,920
It's just so exciting.

1242
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,560
All the things that make it
bad and annoying

1243
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,800
make it brilliant and exciting.

1244
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,920
The noise, and the ride,
and the roughness.

1245
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:54,040
It's just raucous, raw,
bareback, unplugged energy.

1246
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:01,200
I want it to win,
I want it to beat the plane.

1247
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:04,560
But to do that, it
would have to do 113 miles

1248
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:08,360
in the time it takes a bus
to do 23.

1249

(BELL RINGS) PA: Stop requested.

1250

JEREMY: Luckily, however,

1251
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,960
buses have other people on them.

1252
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,200
JAMES: I don't like this bit.
What do you do?

1253
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,840
You just have to sit here.

1254
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:20,440
Yeah. Bus travel
is tricky to like, isn't it?

1255
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,320
And we've gotta stop
and change buses,

1256
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:25,400
and if we lose ten, 15 minutes
waiting for the next bus...

1257
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,000

- 55?
- Yeah.

No, no, we're in Buffalo,

01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:09,200
but we haven't got
to the bus change point.

Oh, really? Oh!
Does your bus keep stopping?

Well, of course it does,
it's a bloody bus!

1274
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,120
I haven't been on one
since I was eight.

1275
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,960
That kept stopping.

1276
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,280

another one, they're stupid."

JEREMY: Amazingly,
I was still in the running,

1280
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:33,600
but my furious pace meant
I had to make a decision.

1281
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:37,760
Do I drive like Al Gore would
want me to drive, at 55mph,

1282
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,640
and possibly make
the finish line

1283
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,040
without having to fill up again,

1284
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,640
or do I floor it,
go really quickly,

1285
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,120
and have a quick
splash-and-dash?

1286
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,200

Oh, no, I can't.

Put the brake on.

1352
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,600
How long you been here?

1353
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:53,480
Long enough
to do some nice pictures

1354
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,720
- and some Instagram work.
- RICHARD: Oh, good.

1355
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,280
JEREMY: Why are you so tired?

1356
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,480
I've been pushing him uphill!

1357
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,760
- RICHARD: He doesn't like it.
- He's actually sweating.

1358
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:05,040
- He's been running!
- I've run on the internet.

1359
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,960
I thought he might have
a heart attack.

1360
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,320
James May is going to die
live on TV.

1361
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,840
I'm gonna do it here,
just talk amongst yourselves.

1362
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,080
(PANTING)

1363
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:18,480
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

1364
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:26,240
The gloating gets worse.

1365
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:30,880
So there we are, the answer to the
question that no one was asking is:

1366
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:35,200
Yes, the Ford GT
is faster than an airliner.

1367
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,160
No, it's faster than a bus.

1368
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,040
And it crippled you
and made you deaf.

1369
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:41,720
He didn't exactly arrive
in tip-top shape, did he?

1370
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,360
No, but hang on,

1371
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,600
that's because I had to
push him around all day,

1372
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,000
and it was like having

1373
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,760
a massive wheeled suitcase
with an opinion

1374
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,240
that pointed at things
like Rommel all the time.

1375
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:54,040
He was the only one who had
a comfortable day, actually.

1376
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,120
- You were.
- You were.

1377
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,720
Cos the honest truth is,

1378
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:00,080
that Ford GT went through
a city and on a motorway,

1379
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,240
and neither
of those environments

1380
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,880
is where it's really at home.

1381
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,600
Yes, like I said in New York,
it's a racing car.

1382
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,040
Yes, which is why I'm going to
get one brought over to the UK

1383
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,760
and later I'm gonna thrash
it round the Eboladrome.

1384
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:15,880
- You're gonna do that?
- As opposed to?

1385
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,040
Well, uh... me?

1386
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,880
People wanna know
what it's like on a track,

1387
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:22,320
not what it's like on its roof.

1388
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:26,560
And on that terrible
disappointment, for you,

1389
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,800
it's time to end.

1390
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:30,320
Thank you so much
for watching, goodnight.

1391
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:33,440
