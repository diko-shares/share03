00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:02.544
Alpa Chino!

2
00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:04.338
We're loaded

3
00:00:04.505 --> 00:00:07.257
I love the pussy, hell, yeah

4
00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:10.010
I love that pussy
dripping down to the floor, no.

5
00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:12.638
The wettest pussy, hell, yeah
I love the pussy, hell, yeah

6
00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:15.807
I'm drinking up
your Booty Sweat and busting a nut.

7
00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:17.684
Alpa Chino got that pussy control.

8
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.686
Alpa Chino's Booty Sweat.

9
00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.230
Pop an ass open!

10
00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:24.900
Booty Sweat and Bust-A-Nut bars
available at concessions now.

11
00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:33.075
In 2013, when the Earth's rotation
came to a halt...

12
00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:36.703
The President has declared
all of North America a disaster area.

13
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.540
I call on my fellow Americans
to come together...

14
00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:43.710
The world called on the one man
who could make a difference.

15
00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:52.010
When it happened again,
the world called on him once more.

16
00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:59.017
And no one saw it coming
three more times!

17
00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:03.188
Now,

18
00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:07.317
the one man who made a difference
five times before,

19
00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:14.116
is about to make a difference again.

20
00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:18.912
Only this time, it's different.

21
00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.416
Who left the fridge open?

22
00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:25.711
Tugg Speedman.

23
00:01:25.877 --> 00:01:30.549
Scorcher VI: Global Meltdown.

24
00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:32.509
Here we go again.

25
00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:35.095
Again.

26
00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:46.315
Will there be anything else?

27
00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:49.776
Yes, my dear man. More beans.

28
00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:53.822
Granny!

29
00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:56.783
Please!

30
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.289
This summer,
America's favorite obese family is back.

31
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.293
Gross!

32
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.503
- You're just mad 'cause I'm skinny.
- Am not!

33
00:02:09.046 --> 00:02:10.422
Jeff Portnoy.

34
00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:12.716
Jeff Portnoy.

35
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.760
Jeff Portnoy.

36
00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:20.932
And Jeff Portnoy are
The Fatties: Fart Two.

37
00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.934
In some countries,

38
00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:25.562
it's considered a compliment.

39
00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:29.066
Letting loose this summer.

40
00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:44.081
In a time where to be different
was to be condemned,

41
00:02:57.803 --> 00:03:02.516
and to be condemned was to die,

42
00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:10.774
one man chose to question his God.

43
00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:16.446
From Fox Searchlight,

44
00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:28.542
five-time Academy Award winner
Kirk Lazarus

45
00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:33.964
and MTV Movie Award
Best Kiss winner Tobey Maguire.

46
00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:44.850
Winner of the Beijing Film Festival's
coveted Crying Monkey Award,

47
00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.061
Satan's Alley.

48
00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:55.152
I've been a bad, bad boy, Father.

49
00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:33.273
In the winter of 1969,

50
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.442
an elite force of the U.S. Army

51
00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:40.405
was sent on a top-secret assignment
in southeast Vietnam.

52
00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:43.241
The objective,
rescue Sergeant Four Leaf Tayback

53
00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:46.411
from a heavily guarded
NVA Prison Camp.

54
00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:49.706
The mission was considered
to be near suicide.

55
00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:54.211
Of the 10 men sent, four returned.

56
00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:57.756
Of those four, three wrote books
about what happened.

57
00:04:57.923 --> 00:05:00.842
Of those three, two were published.

58
00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:05.180
Of those two, just one got a movie deal.

59
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.895
This is the story of the men
who attempted to make that movie.

60
00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:25.200
Whiskey Fire Old Snake
requests an LZ prep

61
00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:27.953
at Alpha-Delta-two-four-eight-niner,
over.

62
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.003
Floyd, this is lead. Right echelon
approach from RP to LZ, acknowledge.

63
00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:40.799
Floyd, Wall-Eye airborne.
Welcome aboard.

64
00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:45.887
All right, lead's going in.
Give her some cover.

65
00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:49.307
Delivery on five.
I repeat, delivery on five.

66
00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:57.274
This is Zero-Three.
I'm on your six, don't worry.

67
00:05:57.607 --> 00:06:00.235
Chalk-Three's taking fire.
Guns right, guns right.

68
00:06:06.992 --> 00:06:09.119
Lay that shit down!

69
00:06:09.578 --> 00:06:10.871
Come on!

70
00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:14.666
Come on, you damn dirty heathens!

71
00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:18.086
Wall-Eye, Wall-Eye,
this is Boomer One-Seven in the Zee!

72
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.214
I need fast movers
on my Yankee Smoke, copy?

73
00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:24.301
Boomer, this is Wall-Eye.
I got two-Alpha-four

74
00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:25.886
- snake and nape on the ready!
- Jesus! Holy shit!

75
00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:27.137
Holy shit!

76
00:06:27.304 --> 00:06:29.306
Get on that horn
and get some firepower, boy!

77
00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:30.682
Jesus Christ!

78
00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.017
Listen, you cherry fuck,

79
00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:35.645
you call in that snake and nape
and get us some boom-boom now!

80
00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:38.231
I'd do it myself
but I'm kind of goddamn busy!

81
00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:39.733
I need an answer, Boomer!

82
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.526
Wall-Eye, Wall-Eye!

83
00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:43.069
I copy!

84
00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:46.406
What the fuck?

85
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.291
That's for Brooklyn, motherfucker!

86
00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.835
I think I can put it back in!

87
00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:01.880
This is the last Christmas
I spend with Victor Charlie up my ass!

88
00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:04.674
Want some? Get some!

89
00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:07.802
Hey, yo, Fats! I ain't seen Four Leaf!

90
00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:11.097
Don't count him out! That bastard's
got luck tattooed to his ass!

91
00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:14.225
Motown, get your Detroit jukebox

00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:16.561
in this chickenshit chop-chop! ASAFP!

93
00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:18.480
Four Leaf is still
outside the perimeter, Sarge!

94
00:07:18.647 --> 00:07:23.068
Miss me with that cracker chump jive!
We Di Di mau! We Di Di mau!

95
00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:24.569
Come on, get down, get down!

96
00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:26.780
What am I looking at? What is this?

97
00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:31.576
Come on, let's get, let's go!
Come on, elevator up, up!

98
00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:34.287
Sarge. It's Four Leaf.

99
00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:48.551
No!

100
00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:56.309
Survive!

101
00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:11.366
Cover me, you limp dick fuckups!

102
00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:20.834
Peek-a-boo! I see you!

103
00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:24.587
Hold on, Four Leaf!

104
00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:28.550
Shit!

105
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.761
Watch my right!

106
00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:35.432
Come on, Leaf, let's boogie!

107
00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:46.443
No!

108
00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:51.698
- Fats!
- Holy fuck!

109
00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:55.535
Take us over to those men! Shit!

110
00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:03.001
Look at you, man.
Playing with grenades.

111
00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:07.756
I'm cold, Linc.

112
00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.634
I can't feel my legs.

113
00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:14.721
Ain't nothing but a thang.

114
00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.391
Hold my hands,

115
00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:20.310
'cause I got something to...

116
00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:22.353
I got something to say.

117
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:24.898
Boy.

118
00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.362
When we get back to the world,

119
00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:35.158
I'm gonna finally teach you
how to juggle.

120
00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:40.371
I ain't never been worth a nothing
in this life,

121
00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:42.874
but I want you to know something.

122
00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:45.627
What, man?

123
00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:48.630
You are my...

124
00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:52.008
You are my brother.

125
00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:08.691
You are my brother.
You are my... You are my...

126
00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:11.820
I am your brother.

127
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:16.699
I'm sorry. Could we cut?

128
00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:18.576
- What's he saying?
- Damien, can we cut?

129
00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:20.328
- No. No, no, no, no, no...
- All right, you know what?

130
00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:23.456
We got the jets coming in,
big explosion, two minutes.

131
00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:24.666
Still rolling.

132
00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:26.376
You know what? No, not still rolling.
Can we cut?

133
00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:28.169
- We're cutting.
- No, we're not. Get out!

134
00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:30.296
Hey, what's going on?
For real, my butt is hurting!

135
00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:32.257
This harness is riding up my crack!

136
00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:35.051
- Damien, are we cutting?
- No! No! Still rolling!

137
00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:37.303
Mr. Cockburn! Are we cutting, sir?

138
00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:40.515
No! No. I'm not cutting!
We're still rolling!

139
00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:41.683
Damien, what's the dealy, dude?

140
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.560
Are we gonna blow
this tree line or what?

141
00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:45.228
Tuk Tuk and Kim
got the blue balls here.

142
00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:46.688
I'm gonna let them squirt if we're a go!

143
00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:48.898
- Play it through. Still rolling!
- Dieter, can he hear me?

144
00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:51.776
That's C-4, dipshit. Put that back.
I said a detonator.

145
00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:54.237
I need some dudes up here
who speak American, God damn it!

146
00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:55.822
He's making
a fucking sweater back here.

147
00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:58.241
I'm trying to put Tiger Balm
on this jungle's nuts.

148
00:10:58.408 --> 00:10:59.492
Shit!

149
00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.244
Alpa Chino hotline. What's up?
What's up, baby?

150
00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:03.580
What the fuck is going on here?

151
00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:04.789
Everyone, please shut up.

152
00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:07.375
The jets are coming in.
We only have one chance at this!

153
00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:10.044
On three, baby. One, two, three, baby.

154
00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:12.297
Look, do me a favor. I don't want to do
a countdown before I do the scene.

155
00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:13.464
- No countdown?
- No countdown.

156
00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:14.757
- Okay.
- Can we just do it off of "Action"?

157
00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:16.509
Just... In your own time.

158
00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:18.344
- Good...
- I'm not a rocket ship, okay?

159
00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.054
- All right, dude.
- And action!

160
00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:23.766
Whatever floats your boat, baby.
Fuck! Don't die!

161
00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:25.560
Erika, get me a VitaminWater!

162
00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:27.187
You know what it is, Damien? I'm sorry.

163
00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:31.774
Not to get into his thing, but if
I'm crying, should Osiris be crying, too?

164
00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:33.693
- No, it's everyone cry...
- We cutting or we crying?

165
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.111
- No, no, no, we're crying!
- Just call it, man!

166
00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:37.363
- Kirk, you can cry. Tugg, you can cry.
- Thanks!

167
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.199
- Everybody cry...
- You know what?

168
00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:41.242
- You see how agitated he is now?
- I know.

169
00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:43.912
- Let's make lemonade. Let's go to work.
- Okay. Still rolling!

170
00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:46.873
This is Falcon One. We have the ridge
in sight, approximately two miles out.

171
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.209
Dieter, these jets
are about to crest this ridge line.

172
00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:51.252
They got about 200 pounds
of shit your pants.

173
00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:52.795
I need to know if we're ready to go.

174
00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:57.467
- You're my... You're my...
- I am your...

175
00:11:57.634 --> 00:12:01.012
See, that's what I think it is, Damien.
I think it's the line.

176
00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:02.138
Yeah?

177
00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:04.140
I don't know if Four Leaf
would say that... Four Leaf?

178
00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:06.100
Were you crying
when your hands blew up?

179
00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:08.269
No. See, he didn't.
Yeah, I mean, just that's what...

180
00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:09.938
So now we in re-writes, right?

181
00:12:10.104 --> 00:12:11.189
- Where you going?
- Let's re-write it!

182
00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:13.441
Action Jackson can't cry.
That's what's going down.

183
00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:15.526
You know what, Kirk?
I'm ready to do the scene!

184
00:12:15.693 --> 00:12:19.197
What scene? The scene is
about emotionality. Where is it?

185
00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:20.907
- Now it's time to flip the script!
- Kirk...

186
00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:23.284
Be here till Chinese New Year
waiting for my man to cry.

187
00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:24.702
Here they come!

188
00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:27.997
- Kirk, no!
- Stop tailgating me, you pasty teabag!

189
00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:29.207
Can I make pee-pee?

190
00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:31.668
- The planes are inbound!
- I know! Shit!

191
00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:35.129
Get the fruit... Jesus! Fuck!
Shit! Cocksucking!

192
00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:38.466
- That's the signal! Go, go, go, go, go!
- Tropic tits!

193
00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:41.302
Goddamn shit-picking cock!

194
00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:44.430
It's beautiful!

195
00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:53.398
Mother Nature just pissed her pantsuit!

196
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.818
Hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot! Fuck!

197
00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:02.740
- Sweet.
- Mama!

198
00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:04.242
Let me down!

199
00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:07.537
Bungle in the jungle.

200
00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:10.707
More bad news from the Vietnamese set
of Tropic Thunder,

201
00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:14.544
where a $4 million explosion
charred the Asian location

202
00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:16.713
and the camera wasn't even rolling.

203
00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:19.382
Financed by hotheaded mega-mogul
Les Grossman,

204
00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:22.593
the film is already rumored to be
one month behind schedule

205
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.555
just five days into shooting.
The reason?

206
00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:28.599
Fingers are pointed at rookie director
Damien Cockburn,

207
00:13:28.766 --> 00:13:31.811
who, insiders say,
can't control a star-studded cast,

208
00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:36.774
including flatulent star of the popular
Fatties franchise, Jeff Portnoy.

209
00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:39.235
Let me tell you something.
A lot of people are disrespecting me.

210
00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:43.072
They say that the movie's
just about farts. It's about family,

211
00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:46.326
and [bleep] you! You can't do what I do.

212
00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:50.580
Fresh from his most recent arrest
for heroin, glue and crack possession,

213
00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:53.041
Portnoy was almost uninsurable.

214
00:13:53.207 --> 00:13:57.503
Also in the mix is Booty Sweat-hocking
hip-hop hyphenate Alpa Chino.

215
00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.048
I'm so excited, you know what I'm
saying, about doing Tropic Thunder.

216
00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:02.342
Hey, drink Booty Sweat, baby.
Drink Booty Sweat.

217
00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:04.135
But the real heavyweight on the set

218
00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:06.929
is five-time Academy Award winner
Kirk Lazarus.

219
00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:10.767
The brilliant Australian
known for his bad boy antics off-screen

220
00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:14.520
is famous for his total immersion
into any role he portrays.

221
00:14:14.812 --> 00:14:16.105
Well, being an actor is no different

222
00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:18.149
than being a rugby player
or a construction worker,

223
00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:19.400
save for the fact that my tools

224
00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:21.611
are the mechanisms
that trigger human emotion.

225
00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:23.738
Lazarus underwent a controversial

226
00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:26.824
pigmentation alteration procedure
in order to play

227
00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:30.036
the platoon's African-American
sergeant, Lincoln Osiris.

228
00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:31.537
Yeah!

229
00:14:31.704 --> 00:14:33.539
Trying to hold his own onscreen
with Kirk

230
00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:35.750
is action juggernaut Tugg Speedman.

231
00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:38.669
Once the highest grossing star
in the world,

232
00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:41.881
lately his Scorcher films
have lost their heat.

233
00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:44.509
Recently, Speedman opened up to Tyra.

234
00:14:44.675 --> 00:14:46.552
You have no real family.

235
00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:51.099
You're on the wrong side of 40.
You're childless and alone.

236
00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:52.892
Somebody close to you said,

237
00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:55.853
"One more flop and it's over."

238
00:14:58.147 --> 00:15:00.066
Somebody said they were close to me?

239
00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:02.068
It's been a tough year for Tugg.

240
00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:04.904
The disappointing buddy comedy
Chitlin' & the Dude

241
00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:09.367
was followed by an ill-advised venture
into serious dramatic territory.

242
00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:11.244
Simple Jack,

243
00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:14.789
the story of a mentally impaired
farmhand who can talk to animals,

244
00:15:15.164 --> 00:15:16.707
was a box office disaster

245
00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:21.379
that many critics called,
"One of the worst movies of all time."

246
00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:25.174
I ain't got a good brain.

247
00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:29.137
I think you've got a fine brain, Jack.

248
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:34.851
You make me happy.

249
00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:40.273
But now the question is,
can Speedman make audiences happy

250
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.150
in what's being called
the most expensive

251
00:15:42.316 --> 00:15:44.527
- war movie never made?
- Rick Peck.

252
00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:46.946
Wishing Tugg all the best on that one.

253
00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:50.575
Rum-Tum-Tuggernauts, it's the Pecker.
You got time for your agent?

254
00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:52.201
- Rick?
- Hey, buddy,

255
00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:53.578
guess who I'm staring at right now.

256
00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:55.746
- What?
- I'm looking at your ugly mug

257
00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:57.748
on the back cover
of Vanity Fair magazine,

258
00:15:57.915 --> 00:16:00.293
holding a cute, cuddly panda
from Cutesville.

259
00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.296
It is insane, bro. You are a rock star.

260
00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:06.048
Hey, did you get the gift basket I sent?

261
00:16:06.215 --> 00:16:07.216
From Rick.

262
00:16:07.383 --> 00:16:09.093
Yeah. Yeah. It's cool, man. Thanks.

263
00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:11.762
All right,
that is a real satellite phone, bro.

264
00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:13.473
Do not re-gift.

265
00:16:13.764 --> 00:16:16.350
Hey. You see
that Access Hollywood piece?

266
00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:19.479
Yeah, I did.
It was like pistol-whipping a blind kid.

267
00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:23.858
I mean, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,
Tugg. You are a huge star, all right?

268
00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:25.109
But right now,

269
00:16:25.276 --> 00:16:26.777
you're like that kid on the playground,
you know,

270
00:16:26.944 --> 00:16:29.947
the one who has lice that none
of the other kids want to play with?

271
00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:32.283
- What do you mean?
- I mean we gotta shave your head

272
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.535
and get you back
on the monkey bars, right?

273
00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:36.037
What?

274
00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:37.705
How did the crying scene go?

275
00:16:38.372 --> 00:16:40.082
Horrible. Lazarus started crying.

276
00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:43.044
Then he starts drooling and dribbling,
and it wasn't even in the script...

277
00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:44.587
Stop right there!

278
00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:46.506
You gotta buck up here, Tuggboat.

279
00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:49.050
Who cares how much more talented
he may be than you?

280
00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:52.428
If he cries, you cry harder, man.

281
00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:55.139
Didn't your dog have, like,
leukemia or something

282
00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:56.516
when you were a kid?
I mean, think of that.

283
00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:59.393
Boom! End of story.
They hook up the TiVo yet?

284
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.145
- No.
- What?

285
00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:03.105
They have digital cable, but,
I mean, it's okay.

286
00:17:03.272 --> 00:17:05.399
No, no, no. Come on, man. It's not okay.

287
00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:07.360
It is not okay, Tugg!

288
00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:10.613
And you don't need to explain to me
why you need TiVo

289
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.992
or clean water, clean sheets,
food, shelter.

290
00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:17.578
I mean,
I fought for that in your contract.

291
00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:20.331
Hey, how's the adoption thing coming,
buddy?

292
00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:22.542
Not too great.

293
00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:25.795
Well, at least you get to choose yours.

294
00:17:26.254 --> 00:17:27.713
I'm stuck with mine.

295
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:32.176
Tell you what, get back to work,
genius soldier.

296
00:17:32.593 --> 00:17:35.513
The Pecker's on a TiVo mission
for the Y-O-U.

297
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.139
Work on those tears, my man.

298
00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:38.391
All right. Yeah.

299
00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:39.850
Say it for me one time.

300
00:17:40.351 --> 00:17:44.480
- You make me happy.
- Make me happy.

301
00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:46.274
- I love you, buddy.
- All right, bye.

302
00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:49.151
Crisis meeting?
What does that mean, exactly?

303
00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:50.945
I mean, you know, are we in a crisis?

304
00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:52.154
He's the head of the studio.

305
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:54.907
He's reaching out.
We're 10,000 miles away.

306
00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:56.409
He just wants a little face-time.

307
00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:58.536
I know, it's just you said
that he called it a crisis meeting. So...

308
00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:01.414
It's Les Grossman.
He throws these words around.

309
00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:05.585
"Crisis," "explosion,"
"not rolling," "fired."

310
00:18:06.168 --> 00:18:07.587
These are just words.

311
00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:09.213
Yeah! Yeah!

312
00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.009
Keep a secret? A camera truck
in London just plowed into Judi Dench.

313
00:18:13.175 --> 00:18:14.302
Trust me, he's got bigger problems.

314
00:18:14.468 --> 00:18:16.804
Look, he may be able to see me,
but I can't see him.

315
00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:21.350
- Move! Move! Hello, Les! Hello!
- Get your ass out of my...

316
00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:22.518
- Your feet were on my desk.
- Can he see us?

317
00:18:22.685 --> 00:18:24.478
I don't know why we don't have...

318
00:18:24.645 --> 00:18:26.647
Get him a Diet Coke. Les! It's working!

319
00:18:26.814 --> 00:18:28.816
Yeah, whatever you're doing right there.
Hello, Les!

320
00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:30.318
- Hello, Les!
- Okay.

321
00:18:30.484 --> 00:18:32.903
We got you loud and clear here, Les.

322
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:36.365
I see you. I see you. I see you.

323
00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:40.077
Which one of you fuckfaces
is Damien Cockburn?

324
00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:41.996
That's me, sir.

325
00:18:42.204 --> 00:18:45.750
It's good to finally meet you at last,
get some face-time.

326
00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:50.546
And who here is the key grip?
You? You.

327
00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.676
Hit that director in the face,
really fucking hard.

328
00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:03.976
Sorry, man.

329
00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:13.361
This is your fault, you limey fuck!

330
00:19:14.111 --> 00:19:15.488
You shit the money-bed, my friend.

331
00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:18.949
Hey, Les, I understand if you're angry,

332
00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:20.910
but I am dealing
with a bunch of prima Donnas!

333
00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:24.413
Clowns! Tugg Speedman, he can't cry!
He can't cry!

334
00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.957
You know how you handle an actor?
They whine about anything,

335
00:19:27.124 --> 00:19:30.461
you pull down their pants
and you spank their ass.

336
00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:32.463
- You spank that ass, Les.
- What?

337
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.592
Spanking a child
turns him into a little snot.

338
00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:40.513
Fear makes him a man.

339
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:45.476
I know a place
where a man's worth is measured

340
00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:49.397
in the ears hanging from his dog tags.

341
00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:52.233
The real deep shit.

342
00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:54.318
You wanna make this movie right?

343
00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:59.031
That's where you take
your pansy-ass actors.

344
00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:01.909
Who is this guy?

345
00:20:02.076 --> 00:20:04.453
Les, that's Four Leaf.

346
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.790
Sergeant Four Leaf Tayback.
I wrote the book.

347
00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:13.629
You're a great American.
This nation owes you a huge debt.

348
00:20:14.296 --> 00:20:17.258
Now shut the fuck up
and let me do my job!

349
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.552
- Look, Cockburn.
- Yes.

350
00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:23.013
From now on, my fist
is gonna be so far up your shithole

351
00:20:23.806 --> 00:20:25.307
that every time you have a thought,

352
00:20:25.474 --> 00:20:27.768
it's gonna have to tiptoe
past my wedding ring.

353
00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:31.397
Take control of your actors,
or I will shut you down.

354
00:20:32.106 --> 00:20:33.107
Diet Coke!

355
00:20:45.661 --> 00:20:48.080
When the herd loses its way,

356
00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:53.085
the shepherd must kill
the bull that leads them astray.

357
00:20:54.837 --> 00:20:58.007
- Four Leaf?
- Come on over. It's okay.

358
00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:00.926
- Sit down.
- Yes.

359
00:21:02.636 --> 00:21:07.641
- So, you don't like the hotel?
- Beds give me nightmares.

360
00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:17.985
I'm guessing right about now
you couldn't find a Dixie coonskin

361
00:21:18.152 --> 00:21:22.615
with an Ohio hooker holding your prick
and showing you the way.

362
00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:30.581
What?

363
00:21:30.748 --> 00:21:34.627
I put my story in your limp Brit hands,

364
00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:37.880
and you are not going to fail me.

365
00:21:38.339 --> 00:21:41.425
You think I was just blowing
my own bagpipe in that meeting?

366
00:21:42.051 --> 00:21:45.805
You must put those boys in the shit.

367
00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:47.306
What? I don't understand.

368
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.851
- You wanna make your movie or not?
- Yes, I do.

369
00:21:51.018 --> 00:21:54.438
All right, you get
some of those little video type cameras.

370
00:21:54.605 --> 00:21:58.150
We take them out there, and we put
them in the trees in different angles.

371
00:21:58.317 --> 00:22:01.570
Then you give me
and that pyromaniac Cody

372
00:22:01.737 --> 00:22:05.991
all the smoke bombs, charges,
explosives, detonators you got.

373
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.410
Then we take those boys up there,

374
00:22:09.245 --> 00:22:11.997
me and Cody,
we could light up that fucking jungle,

375
00:22:12.414 --> 00:22:15.292
so those lily-dick actors
would be shitting their pants

376
00:22:15.459 --> 00:22:17.378
and screaming for their mammies.

377
00:22:17.545 --> 00:22:20.840
They'd be begging for a body bag
if it means a ride home.

378
00:22:23.884 --> 00:22:24.969
I could do it.

379
00:22:26.178 --> 00:22:29.515
I could shoot the whole thing
guerrilla style. Gritty, dirty.

380
00:22:29.682 --> 00:22:32.977
Get them away from their helpers
and ass-licking assistants.

381
00:22:33.143 --> 00:22:34.186
Put them in the real shit.

382
00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:35.479
- Real shit.
- With real fear in their eyes!

383
00:22:35.646 --> 00:22:38.607
Real fear, real emotion!
Yes, Four Leaf, yes!

384
00:22:38.816 --> 00:22:40.818
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

385
00:22:40.985 --> 00:22:42.778
Take them off the fucking grid!

386
00:23:00.212 --> 00:23:02.965
You are no longer actors in a movie!

387
00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:06.802
You are five men in a helicopter!

388
00:23:08.554 --> 00:23:10.347
With three other men!

389
00:23:15.978 --> 00:23:17.438
How long are we gonna be gone,
anyways?

390
00:23:17.605 --> 00:23:21.609
'Cause I left most of my vitamins
back at the hotel.

391
00:23:21.775 --> 00:23:24.612
- Save your breath, maggots!
- That's right, maggots!

392
00:23:47.468 --> 00:23:50.137
Go, go, go! Get out of the chopper!

393
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.516
Move it, maggots, move!
Move, grunts, move your ass!

394
00:23:54.683 --> 00:23:56.936
Get out, you wriggly worms!

395
00:23:57.102 --> 00:23:59.563
- It's up too high!
- Move, move, move!

396
00:24:03.025 --> 00:24:04.777
See you in hell!

397
00:24:16.246 --> 00:24:20.459
This is bullshit! I gotta
at least call my fucking assistant.

398
00:24:21.752 --> 00:24:24.463
Fucking! Jesus! Dude!

399
00:24:25.965 --> 00:24:28.092
You're sitting on a nest
of hostile enemy V.C.

400
00:24:28.258 --> 00:24:31.720
Congratulations, Fats.
You just got us all killed.

401
00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.265
Anybody else care to give away
our position to Charlie?

402
00:24:36.392 --> 00:24:37.935
Cell phones!

403
00:24:38.268 --> 00:24:39.728
What the hell, Damien?

404
00:24:40.062 --> 00:24:43.023
Weren't no cell phones in '69, man.
I'm head-to-toe legitimate.

405
00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:46.986
Gentlemen, I've got good news
and bad news.

406
00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:50.614
The studio wants to shut us down.
That's the bad news.

407
00:24:50.781 --> 00:24:52.533
And the good news.

408
00:24:53.158 --> 00:24:55.995
If you wanna save this movie,
you will become a unit.

409
00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:59.873
Your objective is to head north
to the D'ang Kwook River

410
00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.458
and liberate the POW camp,

411
00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:04.837
at which point Four Leaf
will get himself captured,

412
00:25:05.004 --> 00:25:06.714
at which point you will rescue him,

413
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.259
at which point
we will chopper you home!

414
00:25:11.468 --> 00:25:12.511
Damn.

415
00:25:12.678 --> 00:25:14.471
Four Leaf,
since you're the staff sergeant,

416
00:25:14.763 --> 00:25:16.974
there's the map, this is the scene list.

417
00:25:17.224 --> 00:25:18.225
Think you can handle it?

418
00:25:19.518 --> 00:25:23.522
We have rigged this entire
valley of death with hidden cameras.

419
00:25:24.982 --> 00:25:28.527
And I will be shooting as well,
from unseen vantage points,

420
00:25:28.694 --> 00:25:32.322
so that every glorious moment
is captured on film.

421
00:25:33.741 --> 00:25:36.410
And believe me, gentlemen,
it will be glorious.

422
00:25:36.827 --> 00:25:39.288
If it looks real,
chances are it probably is.

423
00:25:39.455 --> 00:25:40.998
You wanted to be actors.

424
00:25:41.165 --> 00:25:43.709
You wanted to occupy
the skin of another human being.

425
00:25:43.876 --> 00:25:46.795
Well, get ready to occupy the skin
of a terrified U.S. Infantry grunt,

426
00:25:46.962 --> 00:25:50.758
surrounded by death,
crawling up Satan's bottom.

427
00:25:51.759 --> 00:25:56.472
There'll be ambushes, enemy fire,
your own little personal slice of 'Nam.

428
00:25:56.805 --> 00:26:01.101
This radio goes to the chopper
and the chopper only.

429
00:26:01.268 --> 00:26:05.689
The chopper is God,
and I am Jesus Christ, his son.

430
00:26:05.981 --> 00:26:08.484
You are my chosen disciples.

431
00:26:08.776 --> 00:26:11.570
And no one gets to go home
till we get the shots.

432
00:26:11.737 --> 00:26:13.822
Put on your war faces, gentlemen.

433
00:26:15.032 --> 00:26:19.578
Now, let's go and make
the greatest war movie ever!

434
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:21.997
- Yeah!
- All right!

435
00:26:40.724 --> 00:26:41.809
Yeah!

436
00:26:44.394 --> 00:26:45.395
Woo!

437
00:26:47.481 --> 00:26:48.565
Yeah!

438
00:27:01.161 --> 00:27:02.746
Not bad, Cockburn!

439
00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:05.791
Not bad.

440
00:27:07.626 --> 00:27:09.086
Wherever you are!

441
00:27:11.421 --> 00:27:14.466
Wherever he is?
Looks like he's all over the place.

442
00:27:16.135 --> 00:27:17.302
Here we go.

443
00:27:17.928 --> 00:27:19.847
Must be an old French mine.

444
00:27:20.055 --> 00:27:23.851
It's a remnant from colonial Indo-China.
This jungle must be full of them.

445
00:27:24.226 --> 00:27:29.064
Hey! Don't you get it?
He's messing with our heads.

446
00:27:29.439 --> 00:27:31.400
That's what all that
playing God stuff was about.

447
00:27:31.733 --> 00:27:33.861
He's trying to get us to act good,
save the movie.

448
00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:37.573
He ain't playing God.
He's being judged by him.

449
00:27:40.993 --> 00:27:43.704
That's our objective.
Complete the mission.

450
00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:53.088
No offense, Kirk,
I know you're the big fancy actor here,

451
00:27:53.255 --> 00:27:56.800
but I've done a lot more effects-driven
event films than you. Okay?

452
00:27:57.217 --> 00:27:58.635
And I think I can spot

453
00:28:00.804 --> 00:28:02.222
a prop head when I see one.

454
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:03.515
Jesus.

455
00:28:04.892 --> 00:28:08.478
It's corn syrup, guys.
Corn syrup and latex.

456
00:28:11.607 --> 00:28:14.568
Warm, blood-flavored corn syrup.

457
00:28:15.027 --> 00:28:16.195
God.

458
00:28:16.778 --> 00:28:19.615
Smoke and mirrors, guys.
Welcome to the movie factory.

459
00:28:19.948 --> 00:28:21.158
Oldest trick in the book.

460
00:28:23.368 --> 00:28:24.536
He getting down now.

461
00:28:24.703 --> 00:28:25.704
My God!

462
00:28:28.749 --> 00:28:30.083
Look at me!

463
00:28:30.959 --> 00:28:32.461
You're going to get the shots,

464
00:28:32.628 --> 00:28:35.547
and I'm going to make sure
because I'm the director.

465
00:28:35.714 --> 00:28:37.549
I'm from London. I direct plays.

466
00:28:37.716 --> 00:28:40.719
Hey, Damien! We got our war faces on!

467
00:28:50.395 --> 00:28:52.648
Hey, look, I'm Dave Beckham.

468
00:29:02.282 --> 00:29:04.284
So, we gotta
light these boys up today?

469
00:29:04.826 --> 00:29:06.787
Blow some sense into these young men.

470
00:29:07.955 --> 00:29:10.374
Hey, I don't want to come off
as weird or anything,

471
00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:15.254
but I might be your biggest fan. Yeah.

472
00:29:16.171 --> 00:29:19.341
Tropic Thunder.
Kind of like my Catcher in the Rye.

473
00:29:21.009 --> 00:29:23.136
Yeah, I've never been in the military,
per se,

474
00:29:23.303 --> 00:29:25.764
but I have lost an appendage
in the line of duty.

475
00:29:27.557 --> 00:29:29.768
Driving Miss Daisy, first studio gig.

476
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.603
Yeah.

477
00:29:32.104 --> 00:29:34.856
It's a pretty cool sidearm you got there.
What is it?

478
00:29:35.023 --> 00:29:36.692
I don't know what it's called.

479
00:29:37.818 --> 00:29:42.572
I just know the sound it makes
when it takes a man's life.

480
00:29:45.701 --> 00:29:46.743
Okay.

481
00:29:46.952 --> 00:29:48.495
Damien, we're go for explosion.

482
00:29:48.662 --> 00:29:51.373
Ready to kick the tires
and light the fires on your say-so.

483
00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.292
Damien, we're go for explosion.

484
00:29:54.418 --> 00:29:55.377
Do you copy?

485
00:29:55.544 --> 00:29:58.338
I got an itchy trigger finger here,
and I'm ready to blow some shit up.

486
00:29:58.505 --> 00:30:02.134
All right, you happy now?
Can we do the scene?

487
00:30:02.301 --> 00:30:04.886
Or do you need a formal invitation?
Come on, let's go!

488
00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:07.806
Here. Okay.

489
00:30:07.973 --> 00:30:10.267
"Scene 12, exterior,
jungle clearing, day, ambush."

490
00:30:15.605 --> 00:30:17.274
"Four Leaf notices
movement in the brush.

491
00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:20.610
"A dozen guerrilla fighters
can be seen moving in the tree line.

492
00:30:20.777 --> 00:30:23.655
"Somewhere a mine explodes."
And you.

493
00:30:24.698 --> 00:30:25.949
"I got a bad feeling on this one."

494
00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:28.118
- Yeah.
- No, that's your line.

495
00:30:28.285 --> 00:30:31.288
- I got... Now?
- Yeah, but scared. Like, scared.

496
00:30:31.538 --> 00:30:34.041
- "I got a bad feeling on this one."
- Dude, wait, like how?

497
00:30:34.207 --> 00:30:36.001
"I got a bad feeling on this one."

498
00:30:36.168 --> 00:30:38.545
- Okay. Yeah, okay.
- Action. Go, come on.

499
00:30:47.804 --> 00:30:50.140
I got a bad feeling
on this one there, Fats.

500
00:30:51.433 --> 00:30:54.394
Our asses don't get fragged
in this bullshit valley,

501
00:30:54.936 --> 00:30:56.730
first thing I'm doing
is paying my two bucks

502
00:30:56.897 --> 00:30:58.440
so I can watch Brooklyn bust his cherry

503
00:30:58.607 --> 00:31:01.276
on a sweet little mama-san's
dinky dau poontang.

504
00:31:01.443 --> 00:31:04.279
Shit, Brooklyn be bagged and tagged
before he get any cooch.

505
00:31:04.446 --> 00:31:07.657
He die, he probably die
a coochless motherfucker.

506
00:31:07.908 --> 00:31:09.409
Zip it, Motown.

507
00:31:09.576 --> 00:31:10.869
Man, I'm thirsty.

508
00:31:12.287 --> 00:31:17.250
Might as well have some of this
Booty Sweat I got back in Danang.

509
00:31:18.126 --> 00:31:21.254
Yo, asshole! This motherfucker's dead!

510
00:31:21.713 --> 00:31:23.465
Ain't no Criss Angel Mindfreak,

511
00:31:23.632 --> 00:31:26.676
David Blaine trapdoor
horseshit jumping off here!

512
00:31:27.052 --> 00:31:30.764
Hey! You wanna get on the train here,
or do you wanna ruin another take?

513
00:31:30.931 --> 00:31:34.267
There ain't no goddamn takes,
ain't no goddamn motion picture!

514
00:31:35.227 --> 00:31:36.937
- You sure?
- Yeah.

515
00:31:37.104 --> 00:31:38.563
- Yeah?
- For certain, man.

516
00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:40.482
Then why are you still in character?

517
00:31:42.442 --> 00:31:44.444
I know, but I don't have to tell you.

518
00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.405
You don't know.

519
00:31:46.696 --> 00:31:49.658
Man, I don't drop character
till I done a DVD commentary.

520
00:31:52.411 --> 00:31:54.496
You happy now?
We're out of position for the effects!

521
00:31:54.663 --> 00:31:56.415
Get down, fool!

522
00:31:58.125 --> 00:32:01.044
Didn't anyone read the script?
This is the ambush!

523
00:32:02.421 --> 00:32:06.341
- This feels pretty real!
- Exactly! Let's use it.

524
00:32:16.685 --> 00:32:17.853
Yeah!

525
00:32:19.104 --> 00:32:20.981
Yeah!

526
00:32:23.275 --> 00:32:24.526
Eat lead!

527
00:32:26.319 --> 00:32:28.697
They're busting caps
like a motherfucker down there.

528
00:32:32.075 --> 00:32:33.994
This is FUBAR. I say we juice them.

529
00:32:34.161 --> 00:32:35.662
- What do you think?
- Juice them.

530
00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:40.750
Fuck you, Charlie!

531
00:32:42.836 --> 00:32:44.296
Big-ass titties!

532
00:32:50.051 --> 00:32:51.678
Look at that?

533
00:32:57.225 --> 00:32:58.226
And cut!

534
00:33:00.562 --> 00:33:02.272
That's the trailer right there.

535
00:33:02.647 --> 00:33:03.607
Yeah!

536
00:33:03.773 --> 00:33:05.942
- What do we do now?
- Yeah.

537
00:33:06.109 --> 00:33:08.069
North. Man said to head north.

538
00:33:08.236 --> 00:33:11.031
- Did you see me shooting?
- That's how we do. Good work, baby.

539
00:33:11.198 --> 00:33:12.240
I believed it.

540
00:33:12.532 --> 00:33:13.533
D'ang Kwook River.

541
00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:15.452
I'm betting
he's got more of these battles

542
00:33:15.619 --> 00:33:18.330
and Viet Congs
rigged for us along the way.

543
00:33:18.497 --> 00:33:22.626
Sergeant Osiris, get your men.
Load and lock.

544
00:33:22.918 --> 00:33:24.669
Real, baby, I'm real.

545
00:33:25.754 --> 00:33:28.757
Let's go! We got a lot of klicks to cover!

546
00:33:29.925 --> 00:33:32.636
Hump it up, gentlemen!
Single formation.

547
00:33:32.802 --> 00:33:34.638
Don't dawdle now!

548
00:33:59.079 --> 00:34:03.041
D-Rod, D-Rod, this is Puddingface.
How are we coming on that hotplate?

549
00:34:05.961 --> 00:34:09.214
Something's up.
I think we better drag ass back there.

550
00:34:09.381 --> 00:34:11.758
Make sure Damien ain't forgot
how to use his talkbox again.

551
00:34:19.474 --> 00:34:22.769
Yeah, baby, come on. Just a little taste.

552
00:34:24.396 --> 00:34:26.106
- What are you doing, Jeff?
- Fucking... Nothing, man!

553
00:34:26.273 --> 00:34:29.985
- I'm eating jellybeans.
- I love jellybeans. Can I please...

554
00:34:30.151 --> 00:34:32.362
No, you can't have
any fucking jellybeans.

555
00:34:32.529 --> 00:34:33.572
They're mine.

556
00:34:33.738 --> 00:34:34.864
You think
you're the only one who gets sick

557
00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:36.658
when he doesn't have his jellybeans?

558
00:34:36.825 --> 00:34:38.243
Boundaries, man. Fuck.

559
00:34:58.096 --> 00:35:01.141
Hey. I didn't mean to
show you up back there.

560
00:35:01.308 --> 00:35:04.853
It's just, I feel like we really need
to set the example for the other guys.

561
00:35:05.395 --> 00:35:07.063
It's gonna be tough, but

562
00:35:07.397 --> 00:35:10.191
I think Damien's gonna get
some great shit out of us.

563
00:35:12.152 --> 00:35:13.737
Just wish I had
a director like this on Jack.

564
00:35:13.903 --> 00:35:16.406
On Jack. What? Jack?
What you talking about?

565
00:35:17.699 --> 00:35:19.451
- Simple Jack.
- Yeah.

566
00:35:20.952 --> 00:35:23.955
Simple Jack, yeah.
You went all out on that one?

567
00:35:24.331 --> 00:35:26.333
You did.
Really swung for the fences?

568
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:28.835
Thank you. Thanks. Yeah.

569
00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:31.713
Yeah, it was an intense experience,
you know.

570
00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.132
I just... I just did the work.

571
00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:39.137
Watched a lot of retarded people.
Spent time with them. Observed them.

572
00:35:40.221 --> 00:35:42.349
Watched all the retarded stuff they did.

573
00:35:42.515 --> 00:35:44.184
Then again,
I always found mere observation

574
00:35:44.351 --> 00:35:46.603
in and of itself is a tad rudimentary.

575
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:49.773
Sometimes, we gotta dig deeper
to mine the true emotional pay dirt.

576
00:35:49.939 --> 00:35:54.194
Thus, we can diagram the source
of the pain and then live it, you know.

577
00:35:54.361 --> 00:35:56.363
Yeah, yeah, live it. Yeah, exactly.

578
00:35:56.529 --> 00:35:59.199
You know, there were times
when I was doing Jack

579
00:35:59.366 --> 00:36:01.785
that I actually felt retarded,

580
00:36:01.951 --> 00:36:03.745
- like really retarded.
- Damn.

581
00:36:03.912 --> 00:36:07.082
In a weird way,
I had to sort of just free myself up

582
00:36:07.248 --> 00:36:10.085
to believe that it was okay
to be stupid or dumb.

583
00:36:10.335 --> 00:36:11.836
- To be a moron.
- Yeah.

584
00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:14.631
- To be moronical.
- Exactly, to be a moron.

585
00:36:14.839 --> 00:36:16.132
- An imbecile.
- Yeah.

586
00:36:16.299 --> 00:36:18.426
Like the dumbest motherfucker
that ever lived.

587
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.387
When I was playing the character.

588
00:36:20.553 --> 00:36:23.056
- When you was the character.
- Yeah, I mean, as Jack, definitely.

589
00:36:23.223 --> 00:36:25.308
Jack, stupid ass Jack.

590
00:36:25.558 --> 00:36:27.227
By the end of the whole thing, I was like,

591
00:36:27.394 --> 00:36:29.521
"Wait a minute, you know,
I flushed so much out,

592
00:36:29.688 --> 00:36:31.856
how am I gonna jumpstart it up again?"

593
00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:34.025
- It's just like... Right?
- Yeah.

594
00:36:34.192 --> 00:36:36.903
You was farting in bathtubs
and laughing your ass off.

595
00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:39.531
Yeah. I mean, it was really quite a...
It was crazy.

596
00:36:39.698 --> 00:36:43.076
It's like working with mercury.
It's high science, man. It's an art form.

597
00:36:43.243 --> 00:36:45.203
- Yeah.
- You an artist.

598
00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:47.080
- That's what we do, right? Yeah.
- Yeah.

599
00:36:47.247 --> 00:36:48.456
Hats off for going there,

600
00:36:48.623 --> 00:36:51.376
especially knowing how
the Academy is about that shit.

601
00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:58.591
- About what?
- You're serious? You don't know?

602
00:37:00.802 --> 00:37:02.846
Everybody knows
you never go full retard.

603
00:37:04.347 --> 00:37:06.433
- What do you mean?
- Check it out.

604
00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:10.645
Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man, looked
retarded, act retarded, not retarded.

605
00:37:10.812 --> 00:37:14.899
Count toothpicks, cheat at cards.
Autistic, sure. Not retarded.

606
00:37:15.775 --> 00:37:17.569
Then you got Tom Hanks,
Forrest Gump.

607
00:37:17.736 --> 00:37:19.946
Slow, yes, retarded, maybe,
braces on his legs.

608
00:37:20.113 --> 00:37:22.949
But he charmed the pants off Nixon,
and he won a Ping-Pong competition.

609
00:37:23.116 --> 00:37:24.325
That ain't retarded.

610
00:37:25.452 --> 00:37:28.413
Peter Sellers, Being There.
Infantile, yes. Retarded, no.

611
00:37:30.165 --> 00:37:32.167
You went full retard, man.

612
00:37:33.501 --> 00:37:34.878
Never go full retard.

613
00:37:35.879 --> 00:37:39.382
You don't buy that?
Ask Sean Penn, 2001, I Am Sam.

614
00:37:39.549 --> 00:37:42.844
Remember? Went full retard?
Went home empty-handed.

615
00:37:52.645 --> 00:37:55.857
My God! Holy shit!

616
00:37:56.524 --> 00:37:59.152
Good job, turd. You killed the director.

617
00:37:59.319 --> 00:38:00.528
No, that's impossible, man.

618
00:38:00.695 --> 00:38:03.531
I rigged the whole tree line,
and this is here.

619
00:38:03.698 --> 00:38:05.158
- He must have missed his mark.
- Missed his mark?

620
00:38:05.325 --> 00:38:06.493
Yeah, this isn't me.

621
00:38:06.659 --> 00:38:09.412
Come on, let's bag and tag the bastard
and get back to the hotel.

622
00:38:09.579 --> 00:38:12.207
- You're in a world of hurt, dumbo!
- We're in a world of hurt!

623
00:38:12.373 --> 00:38:14.501
- You're in trouble.
- This isn't just on me!

624
00:38:14.667 --> 00:38:16.836
- We're in a... We're together on this.
- Bullshit.

625
00:38:17.003 --> 00:38:18.379
You're just gonna run away.
You're gonna leave.

626
00:38:18.546 --> 00:38:20.173
What happened to,
"No man left behind," okay?

627
00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.550
Just wait, just wait, just wait!
Listen! Listen, okay?

628
00:38:22.717 --> 00:38:25.386
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Let me just be real with you, all right?

629
00:38:25.553 --> 00:38:28.765
I almost blinded Jamie Lee Curtis
on Freaky Friday, okay?

630
00:38:28.932 --> 00:38:30.308
This shit will fucking ruin me!

631
00:38:30.475 --> 00:38:32.185
- Just get off me! You're pathetic.
- No, I'm not.

632
00:38:32.352 --> 00:38:34.854
- Get off me!
- You are not going back!

633
00:38:38.191 --> 00:38:40.151
- What the fuck?
- Now wait a minute.

634
00:38:57.919 --> 00:38:59.462
I fucking hate movies.

635
00:39:01.798 --> 00:39:04.843
This is bullshit.
I don't wanna be in this shitty movie.

636
00:39:14.477 --> 00:39:17.146
No! That's my jellybeans! No!

637
00:39:17.313 --> 00:39:21.943
Kid, grab the bat! Please! Shit!

638
00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:25.572
- Yo, man, I got a Bust-A-Nut.
- You go to hell! There he is.

639
00:39:28.783 --> 00:39:31.870
God damn it! Okay. Where'd he go?

640
00:39:32.704 --> 00:39:35.164
You little piece of shit!
I'm gonna fucking rip your wings off!

641
00:39:37.083 --> 00:39:40.128
Sanducci. Hold up, man,
keep it on the down-low.

642
00:39:41.546 --> 00:39:43.715
I don't really gotta piss.
I'm trying to talk at you, man.

643
00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:45.508
Bait, I need bait.

644
00:39:46.926 --> 00:39:50.263
You went to boot camp, right?
You can read a map?

645
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:51.598
Yeah, I think so.

646
00:39:51.764 --> 00:39:54.392
I know Speedman
got everyone convinced we out here

647
00:39:54.559 --> 00:39:58.313
making Planet of the Apes on YouTube
or some shit, but I don't buy it.

648
00:39:58.646 --> 00:40:00.940
You wanna step on a real landmine?
You wanna die?

649
00:40:01.733 --> 00:40:03.359
You wanna get shot
by a real motherfucker?

650
00:40:03.526 --> 00:40:06.738
- Keep looking ahead, man.
- No, of course not.

651
00:40:06.905 --> 00:40:09.616
If I can put that map in your hands,
can I count you in?

652
00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:13.995
- Well, yeah, I guess you can.
- Dynamite. I'm out.

653
00:40:17.874 --> 00:40:20.043
That smelled just like bologna
for some reason.

654
00:40:20.209 --> 00:40:22.754
Is anybody gonna fucking help me
get this fucking thing?

655
00:40:23.421 --> 00:40:24.964
Why are they even out in the daytime?

656
00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:30.553
I'm gonna level with you, bro.
I don't need to pee.

657
00:40:31.596 --> 00:40:32.639
I need to talk to you.

658
00:40:39.228 --> 00:40:43.483
Lazarus is gonna torpedo the movie.

659
00:40:45.026 --> 00:40:46.819
He's way out on a limb
with this character,

660
00:40:46.986 --> 00:40:48.488
and I think he's getting cold feet.

661
00:40:49.948 --> 00:40:53.326
- I need you on my side, Kyle.
- It's Kevin.

662
00:40:53.785 --> 00:40:55.662
Good. Can I count on you?

663
00:40:56.829 --> 00:41:00.583
Yeah. If you want,
I could give the map a look-see.

664
00:41:01.084 --> 00:41:02.877
- I'll handle the map.
- Okay.

665
00:41:03.044 --> 00:41:05.755
You stick with the program,
we get this movie in the can,

666
00:41:06.381 --> 00:41:08.967
I'm thinking there could be
a Teen Choice Award in it for you.

667
00:41:10.176 --> 00:41:14.305
You have that potential.
They'll slime you, the whole deal.

668
00:41:14.472 --> 00:41:18.101
- Yeah, that's wicked.
- Good.

669
00:41:23.982 --> 00:41:26.567
There it is! Yeah, now you're dead!

670
00:41:27.652 --> 00:41:29.195
You O.D.'d!

671
00:41:30.071 --> 00:41:31.572
Hold up now, Jeff.

672
00:41:34.117 --> 00:41:35.827
Fucking hell!

673
00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:39.831
What the hell, Jeff? That's a bat, man!

674
00:41:40.289 --> 00:41:42.834
I don't have any more jellybeans.

675
00:41:49.298 --> 00:41:51.092
You land there!

676
00:42:05.773 --> 00:42:08.776
Look at these ruins.

677
00:42:10.653 --> 00:42:14.699
- Where the hell are we?
- D'ang Kwook River.

678
00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:17.535
That so? How do you know that?
How you sure?

679
00:42:17.702 --> 00:42:19.871
Only one way to find out, dude. Let's go.

680
00:42:20.038 --> 00:42:24.667
Yeah. I'm not feeling so good right now.
Seriously, my skin hurts!

681
00:42:25.168 --> 00:42:27.211
Enough from the peanut gallery!
Into the water, ladies!

682
00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:29.797
No, no, no, man. Let me take a look
at that map right quick.

683
00:42:29.964 --> 00:42:31.507
Why is everybody
all obsessed with the map?

684
00:42:31.674 --> 00:42:33.634
'Cause we're tired
of being your trail donkeys!

685
00:42:33.801 --> 00:42:36.012
Acting like you some one-man GPS!

686
00:42:36.345 --> 00:42:40.141
God damn it! We lost!
We fucking super lost, man!

687
00:42:40.308 --> 00:42:42.226
Tell him, McClusky.
Tell him what time it is.

688
00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.103
I don't believe you people.

689
00:42:45.855 --> 00:42:47.565
What do you mean "you people"?

690
00:42:50.234 --> 00:42:52.403
What do you mean, "you people"?

691
00:42:52.904 --> 00:42:54.822
I think what Tugg means is...

692
00:42:54.989 --> 00:42:56.324
No, look at his eyes, man.

693
00:42:56.491 --> 00:42:59.118
- You people, you actors. You people...
- Look at them beady, white devil eyes.

694
00:42:59.285 --> 00:43:00.787
I gotta get back to the hotel, for real!

695
00:43:00.953 --> 00:43:01.954
- Hell, no!
- Silence!

696
00:43:03.956 --> 00:43:06.626
Chill! All right? Just chill it.

697
00:43:08.127 --> 00:43:11.339
Now, let's go get those Viet Congs.

698
00:43:12.131 --> 00:43:14.050
- "Viet Cong"!
- What?

699
00:43:14.217 --> 00:43:17.178
It's "Viet Cong." There's no "s."
It's already plural.

700
00:43:17.345 --> 00:43:18.971
You wouldn't say "Chineses."

701
00:43:20.306 --> 00:43:22.683
All right, that's enough
of this insubordination!

702
00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:25.603
If the machine breaks down,
we break down.

703
00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:28.231
Hey, man, you know how in Rambo I,
he was big but a little puffy

704
00:43:28.397 --> 00:43:29.899
and then Rambo ll,
he got all shredded up?

705
00:43:30.066 --> 00:43:31.859
- Yeah.
- That's kind of how you look right now.

706
00:43:32.151 --> 00:43:34.529
- Yeah?
- You know, not Rambo I but ll.

707
00:43:34.695 --> 00:43:36.364
- Really?
- Yeah, when he was cut up.

708
00:43:36.531 --> 00:43:38.866
I'm not that... I mean,
that's what I'm going for, but you know...

709
00:43:39.033 --> 00:43:41.661
Come on, dude. You more shredded
than a julienne salad, man.

710
00:43:41.828 --> 00:43:43.246
- Thanks.
- What's the secret, dude?

711
00:43:43.412 --> 00:43:44.705
- It's a diet. I'm just dieting.
- Really?

712
00:43:44.872 --> 00:43:47.834
'Cause I'm trying to come up a little,
but it's just... It's tough.

713
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.418
- You look good.
- Any tips?

714
00:43:49.585 --> 00:43:51.212
- What?
- Any tips, you got?

715
00:43:51.379 --> 00:43:52.463
There's, like, the pineapple...

716
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:54.841
- Give me that goddamn map! Fuck you!
- Hey!

717
00:43:55.007 --> 00:43:56.509
- Hey!
- All right, now!

718
00:43:56.759 --> 00:43:59.095
What it is, Sikorski?
Tell us where we really at.

719
00:43:59.262 --> 00:44:01.180
That's fucking bullshit!
It's a chump move.

720
00:44:01.347 --> 00:44:03.307
We just getting a second opinion, doc.

721
00:44:05.101 --> 00:44:06.310
We're going the wrong way!

722
00:44:06.477 --> 00:44:07.520
- Damn!
- Son of a bitch.

723
00:44:07.687 --> 00:44:10.940
God! I think we were
supposed to be doing this,

724
00:44:12.233 --> 00:44:14.652
and instead we did this.

725
00:44:14.819 --> 00:44:18.823
Shit, shit, shit, shitty shit, shit!

726
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:20.992
Think you can get us back
to that drop zone, boy?

727
00:44:22.451 --> 00:44:23.870
This is not cool!

728
00:44:26.289 --> 00:44:27.456
Maybe.

729
00:44:29.125 --> 00:44:30.626
This is insane!

730
00:44:31.878 --> 00:44:34.213
Are you really going
to abandon this movie?

731
00:44:35.006 --> 00:44:37.133
We're supposed to be a unit!

732
00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:38.843
Suck my unit!

733
00:44:39.719 --> 00:44:41.429
All right, fine.

734
00:44:41.596 --> 00:44:45.725
- I'll finish it by myself.
- You go be all you can be, man.

735
00:44:46.601 --> 00:44:48.561
Tugg, you have no idea
where you're going!

736
00:44:48.728 --> 00:44:50.021
Yes, I do!

737
00:44:50.605 --> 00:44:55.067
I'm going to,
"Exterior, rain forest, dusk."

738
00:44:55.234 --> 00:44:59.238
"Smash cut to Four Leaf, who treks
alone through a frightening jungle."

739
00:44:59.822 --> 00:45:01.741
Suck on that unit, Kirk!

740
00:45:15.296 --> 00:45:18.299
Come on, men. Let's get home.

741
00:45:56.462 --> 00:45:58.130
Hello, Mr. Mantis.

742
00:46:00.383 --> 00:46:01.467
You're beautiful.

743
00:46:03.386 --> 00:46:05.263
Now, if you recall that whole hullabaloo

744
00:46:05.429 --> 00:46:07.056
where Hollywood
was split into schisms,

745
00:46:07.223 --> 00:46:10.601
some studios backing Blu-ray Disc,
others backing HD DVD.

746
00:46:10.768 --> 00:46:11.769
People thought it would come down to

747
00:46:11.936 --> 00:46:14.146
pixel rate or refresh rate,
and they're pretty much the same.

748
00:46:14.313 --> 00:46:18.067
What it came down to was
a combination of gamers and porn.

749
00:46:18.234 --> 00:46:19.902
Now, whichever format porno backs

750
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:23.823
is usually the one
that becomes the most successful.

751
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:26.909
But, you know, Sony,
every PlayStation 3 has a Blu-ray in it.

752
00:46:27.076 --> 00:46:28.828
You talking to me this whole time?

753
00:46:29.537 --> 00:46:30.913
I was talking to whoever
was listening to me.

754
00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:32.415
Jesus Christ, man!

755
00:46:50.808 --> 00:46:52.893
Booty Sweat.

756
00:46:58.899 --> 00:47:00.318
God!

757
00:47:02.737 --> 00:47:07.033
It's cold! It's freezing.
I'm fucking cold.

758
00:47:07.199 --> 00:47:08.576
You want my flak jacket?

759
00:47:09.535 --> 00:47:13.664
What, are you insane? It's boiling!
It's like a sweat lodge out here!

760
00:47:13.831 --> 00:47:16.250
Keep the volume down on that bitching,
Flatch Adams.

761
00:47:16.417 --> 00:47:18.544
I gotta take a fucking 12-pound shit!

762
00:47:18.711 --> 00:47:20.588
- How we doing? We making good time?
- We're making good time,

763
00:47:20.755 --> 00:47:23.549
but there's no way we make it
over that ridge before sundown.

764
00:47:23.924 --> 00:47:26.469
All right, fellas,
we're gonna make camp, rest up!

765
00:47:26.635 --> 00:47:28.846
- God.
- Y'all might be in for a treat.

766
00:47:29.013 --> 00:47:30.473
You know,
back before the war broked out,

767
00:47:30.639 --> 00:47:32.892
I was a saucier in San Antone.

768
00:47:33.059 --> 00:47:35.603
I bet I could collar up
some of them greens.

769
00:47:35.978 --> 00:47:39.357
Yeah, noodle some crawfish
out the paddy, yo.

770
00:47:40.483 --> 00:47:44.612
And maybe some crab apples
for dessert, now, you hear? Hell, yeah!

771
00:47:45.696 --> 00:47:46.906
Hell, yeah!

772
00:47:47.073 --> 00:47:51.410
That's how we all talk.
We all talk like this, suh! Yes, suh.

773
00:47:51.577 --> 00:47:56.374
Yeah, get some crawfish
and some ribs. Yeah!

774
00:47:56.832 --> 00:48:01.837
You're Australian! Be Australian!
Excuse me, Kangaroo Jack.

775
00:48:06.092 --> 00:48:08.052
I get excited about my foods, man.

776
00:49:33.929 --> 00:49:36.640
Die!

777
00:49:50.362 --> 00:49:53.032
No!

778
00:49:58.996 --> 00:50:01.874
Dude, dude, what the hell
is going on here? Where are we?

779
00:50:03.459 --> 00:50:04.752
I have no idea.

780
00:50:05.961 --> 00:50:07.963
I've never been outside the States.

781
00:50:08.422 --> 00:50:10.674
Wait, what?
Are you fucking kidding me?

782
00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:12.301
Did you make this
whole goddamn thing up?

783
00:50:12.927 --> 00:50:14.261
Dude, were you
even in the fucking service?

784
00:50:14.428 --> 00:50:17.014
Yes. Of course. Coast Guard.

785
00:50:17.181 --> 00:50:19.016
- Coast Guard.
- Sanitation Department.

786
00:50:19.183 --> 00:50:21.810
My God!
You're a fucking garbage man!

787
00:50:21.977 --> 00:50:25.648
Damn it. F.L. Tayback lies to me
and the whole goddamn U.S. of A.

788
00:50:25.814 --> 00:50:28.400
I wrote the book as a tribute!
I'm a patriot!

789
00:50:28.567 --> 00:50:30.569
Yeah, you're the Milli Vanilli
of patriots, okay?

790
00:50:30.736 --> 00:50:32.363
You lied
about fighting the Vietnam War.

791
00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:35.741
It's like punching the American flag
in the face, God damn it.

792
00:50:35.908 --> 00:50:37.284
God, and to think I believed in you!

793
00:50:37.451 --> 00:50:39.745
- I don't wanna be next to you.
- Writers lie all the time.

794
00:50:39.912 --> 00:50:42.039
Can I be tied to another post? Okay.

795
00:51:03.644 --> 00:51:04.979
- Rick?
- Tugg.

796
00:51:05.563 --> 00:51:06.855
I killed one, Rick.

797
00:51:08.774 --> 00:51:10.401
The thing I love most in the world.

798
00:51:11.277 --> 00:51:12.861
Vivica, get off the line now!

799
00:51:15.406 --> 00:51:17.283
A hooker. All right, you killed a hooker.

800
00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:19.910
Calm down.
Here's what you're gonna do.

801
00:51:20.077 --> 00:51:21.161
Get your hands on some bleach,

802
00:51:21.328 --> 00:51:23.455
some hydrogen peroxide
and a shitload of lime.

803
00:51:23.789 --> 00:51:24.915
No, a panda.

804
00:51:25.416 --> 00:51:27.126
I killed a panda.

805
00:51:27.293 --> 00:51:29.003
Amanda? Come on, dude.

806
00:51:29.169 --> 00:51:31.130
I mean,
that's probably not even her real name.

807
00:51:31.297 --> 00:51:32.548
No, a panda!

808
00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:34.133
A panda?

809
00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:36.844
A sweet, cuddly,

810
00:51:37.261 --> 00:51:39.138
vicious little panda.

811
00:51:39.305 --> 00:51:42.182
Jesus Christ, Tugg!
Man, don't scare me like that!

812
00:51:42.391 --> 00:51:43.434
It's beautiful here.

813
00:51:43.601 --> 00:51:45.060
You on the set?

814
00:51:45.227 --> 00:51:46.395
I am the set.

815
00:51:46.562 --> 00:51:47.563
All right, man.

816
00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:49.481
Hey, how's the TiVo working out?

817
00:51:49.648 --> 00:51:50.816
Screw TiVo.

818
00:51:50.983 --> 00:51:52.401
I'm way beyond TiVo.

819
00:51:53.527 --> 00:51:55.321
Last I checked,
they hadn't hooked it up, though.

820
00:51:55.738 --> 00:51:58.198
Hadn't hooked it up? No TiVo?

821
00:51:59.158 --> 00:52:00.993
It doesn't matter anymore.

822
00:52:03.787 --> 00:52:05.289
I've moved on.

823
00:52:06.165 --> 00:52:07.666
Where have you moved on to?

824
00:52:07.833 --> 00:52:09.001
Another agency?

825
00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:11.920
Hey, who is with you?

826
00:52:12.087 --> 00:52:16.133
You are still my client, Tugg Speedman!
I am getting the TiVo!

827
00:52:16.508 --> 00:52:18.427
Jacket's on, I'm out the door!

828
00:52:18.594 --> 00:52:19.678
Tugg?

829
00:52:23.015 --> 00:52:24.016
Please don't fire me.

830
00:52:27.227 --> 00:52:29.563
Mama. Thirsty.

831
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:32.232
He doesn't look too good.

832
00:52:32.399 --> 00:52:37.363
Must drink,
so I can throw something up!

833
00:52:37.529 --> 00:52:39.615
No, no. Don't drink that water!
That water's like a petri dish!

834
00:52:39.782 --> 00:52:40.824
No, don't!

835
00:52:40.991 --> 00:52:42.660
Alpa, do you have any Booty Sweat?

836
00:52:43.619 --> 00:52:45.913
Yeah, get him chugging on
some of Alpa's ass water.

837
00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:47.956
That'll bring him around. It's a cure-all.

838
00:52:48.123 --> 00:52:49.958
Man, what you coming out
in movies for anyway?

839
00:52:50.125 --> 00:52:51.710
Did you need another revenue stream?

840
00:52:51.877 --> 00:52:54.588
For your information,
my revenue stream

841
00:52:54.755 --> 00:52:57.049
currently generates $2 million a year

842
00:52:57.216 --> 00:52:59.093
in charitable contributions
for my community.

843
00:52:59.259 --> 00:53:01.512
- Hot damn.
- And why am I in this movie?

844
00:53:01.679 --> 00:53:03.931
Maybe I just knew I had to represent,

845
00:53:04.098 --> 00:53:06.058
because they had one good part
in it for a Black man

846
00:53:06.225 --> 00:53:08.060
and they gave it to Crocodile Dundee.

847
00:53:09.687 --> 00:53:12.398
Pump your brakes, kid.
That man is a national treasure.

848
00:53:13.357 --> 00:53:15.401
I just wanted to throw another shrimp
on your barbie.

849
00:53:15.567 --> 00:53:16.652
That shit ain't funny.

850
00:53:16.819 --> 00:53:19.446
Hey, fellas! It's hot!
We're tired! It stinks!

851
00:53:19.613 --> 00:53:21.198
I'm just fucking with you,
Kangaroo Jack!

852
00:53:21.365 --> 00:53:22.950
I'm sorry a dingo ate your baby.

853
00:53:23.117 --> 00:53:25.494
You know that's a true story?
Lady lost her kid.

854
00:53:25.661 --> 00:53:28.706
- You about to cross some fucking lines.
- Guys, relax and stuff.

855
00:53:28.872 --> 00:53:29.873
You know what? Fuck that, man!

856
00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.959
I'm sick of this koala-hugging nigga
telling me...

857
00:53:37.005 --> 00:53:38.590
For 400 years,

858
00:53:39.758 --> 00:53:42.511
that word has kept us down.

859
00:53:43.554 --> 00:53:45.139
What the fuck?

860
00:53:45.305 --> 00:53:48.434
It took a whole lot of trying
just to get up that hill.

861
00:53:49.351 --> 00:53:51.395
Now we up in the big leagues,

862
00:53:52.187 --> 00:53:53.856
getting our turn at bat.

863
00:53:54.022 --> 00:53:56.191
Long as we live, it's you and me, baby.

864
00:53:57.651 --> 00:54:00.654
That's the theme song for
The Jeffersons. You really need help.

865
00:54:00.821 --> 00:54:03.157
Yeah. Just 'cause it's the theme song,
don't make it not true.

866
00:54:04.283 --> 00:54:05.909
You know what?
I'm gonna tell you what's true.

867
00:54:06.076 --> 00:54:09.455
I'm gonna tag you back.
You better believe that, baby.

868
00:54:09.788 --> 00:54:12.207
Guys! Hey, guys!

869
00:54:13.125 --> 00:54:15.294
Jeff, stay away from that animal.

870
00:54:18.005 --> 00:54:20.883
I'm gonna bite his hide. I need...

871
00:54:21.717 --> 00:54:24.762
I need to wear his stomach skin
like a unitard.

872
00:54:25.971 --> 00:54:28.849
Ain't nobody doing nothing
to no one or body!

873
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:33.937
Now, if Mr. Portnoy is feeling
a little flu-ish, don't wanna walk,

874
00:54:34.313 --> 00:54:36.190
put him up on that cloven-hoof animal!

875
00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:39.026
We got ground to cover!

876
00:55:08.096 --> 00:55:11.099
All right, POW camp, scene 67.

877
00:55:12.184 --> 00:55:13.727
Bring it on, Cockburn!

878
00:55:21.026 --> 00:55:24.863
My body may be shackled,
but my mind wanders free.

879
00:55:29.701 --> 00:55:30.786
Wait, wait, wait,
let me do the line again.

880
00:55:30.953 --> 00:55:31.954
Let me do the line again.

881
00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:36.333
My body may be shackled,
but my mind wanders free.

882
00:55:43.423 --> 00:55:44.800
Good, again. Again.

883
00:55:50.681 --> 00:55:53.058
Good, good.
Now let's do the torture scene.

884
00:55:53.225 --> 00:55:54.685
I see moss on both sides of that tree.

885
00:55:54.852 --> 00:55:58.522
Well, you know, maybe if I wasn't
the only one at boot camp...

886
00:55:58.689 --> 00:56:00.357
My belly really hurts, you guys!

887
00:56:00.524 --> 00:56:02.192
I'm not joking around, I'm nauseous.

888
00:56:02.651 --> 00:56:04.486
Let me off, I gotta puke!
I don't wanna die like Hendrix!

889
00:56:04.653 --> 00:56:06.363
All right. All right.

890
00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:12.870
Are you okay, Jeff?

891
00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:14.746
I'm awesome.

892
00:56:16.957 --> 00:56:18.458
Holy shit!

893
00:56:22.796 --> 00:56:25.215
Okay. Everyone, down, down, down.

894
00:56:30.053 --> 00:56:31.471
Man. Now I'm tripping.

895
00:56:31.638 --> 00:56:34.308
That looks like the POW camp
from out the script, yo.

896
00:56:34.766 --> 00:56:36.226
Speedman was right?

897
00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:37.853
I don't think so.

898
00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:40.606
Look at the cooking vats,
the armed guards.

899
00:56:42.316 --> 00:56:43.942
Looks like a heroin processing plant.

900
00:56:45.485 --> 00:56:46.570
We were in that chopper for hours.

901
00:56:46.737 --> 00:56:48.572
I don't even think
we're in Vietnam anymore.

902
00:56:49.114 --> 00:56:51.450
- Fuck.
- Shit. We ain't even in 'Nam?

903
00:56:51.617 --> 00:56:53.827
No, most likely Myanmar or Laos.

904
00:56:54.494 --> 00:56:55.662
What the fuck is Laos?

905
00:56:56.163 --> 00:56:57.289
It's the Golden Triangle.

906
00:56:58.081 --> 00:56:59.583
The world's hard drug superhighway.

907
00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:00.959
And how do you know about that?

908
00:57:01.126 --> 00:57:03.503
It was a really long trip.
I read the in-flight magazine.

909
00:57:05.672 --> 00:57:06.882
Cut!

910
00:57:07.049 --> 00:57:08.091
Jesus!

911
00:57:08.634 --> 00:57:09.885
What do you see, man? I'm blocked.

912
00:57:11.219 --> 00:57:12.596
Damien, cut!

913
00:57:14.348 --> 00:57:15.974
Hey, Damien, cut!

914
00:57:16.808 --> 00:57:18.477
They got Speedman.

915
00:57:19.019 --> 00:57:20.479
And it doesn't look good.

916
00:57:53.095 --> 00:57:54.388
I am Tran.

917
00:57:55.347 --> 00:57:57.265
You are a trespasser
in my poppy fields.

918
00:57:58.934 --> 00:58:01.561
You are D.E.A. scum!

919
00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:06.942
Were there some re-writes
that I missed?

920
00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:14.241
Do you want to die?

921
00:58:15.492 --> 00:58:16.576
- Do you?
- No!

922
00:58:17.077 --> 00:58:21.456
Please, don't hurt me!

923
00:58:29.006 --> 00:58:30.007
Say that again.

924
00:58:31.258 --> 00:58:33.010
Please, don't hurt me.

925
00:58:33.176 --> 00:58:36.221
No! Like you did before! Say it!

926
00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:38.181
Say it!

927
00:58:38.348 --> 00:58:42.352
Please, don't hurt me!

928
00:58:57.951 --> 00:59:00.537
- What?
- You are Simple Jack.

929
00:59:03.498 --> 00:59:05.292
You saw Simple Jack?

930
00:59:05.459 --> 00:59:07.794
We love the tale of this man,
Simple Jack.

931
00:59:09.504 --> 00:59:11.131
We do not have many luxury here.

932
00:59:11.423 --> 00:59:13.717
And Simple Jack is the only movie
we possess.

933
00:59:13.967 --> 00:59:17.554
You got the VHS.

934
00:59:17.888 --> 00:59:19.598
We've watched it many, many times.

935
00:59:20.057 --> 00:59:22.517
You should've got Oscar.

936
00:59:25.562 --> 00:59:27.355
Well, you know. It's...

937
00:59:28.607 --> 00:59:29.733
Just to be nominated...

938
00:59:29.983 --> 00:59:31.151
You were nominated?

939
00:59:31.318 --> 00:59:32.778
No, no, no. I wasn't nominated.

940
00:59:32.944 --> 00:59:36.031
I'm just saying that to have been
nominated would have been nice.

941
00:59:36.198 --> 00:59:38.492
It's just... It's very political.
You have to take out ads...

942
00:59:38.658 --> 00:59:41.161
- Shut up now!
- Okay. Okay.

943
00:59:41.995 --> 00:59:43.747
So, are you going to

944
00:59:45.373 --> 00:59:47.042
let me go, or...

945
00:59:47.209 --> 00:59:49.169
No. We'll hold you for ransom.

946
00:59:49.336 --> 00:59:50.712
Much more money now!

947
01:00:02.641 --> 01:00:03.642
He's in a meeting.

948
01:00:03.809 --> 01:00:06.561
Yeah, I know.
In about two seconds with the Pecker.

949
01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:09.397
I'm gonna rip your fucking tits off.

950
01:00:09.564 --> 01:00:11.691
You wanna talk about trouble?
That's trouble.

951
01:00:15.821 --> 01:00:17.614
What do you need, Peck?

952
01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:20.367
No, more like what do you need, Les?

953
01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:21.743
Glasses?

954
01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:23.787
What?

955
01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:26.414
So you can read
the Tropic Thunder contract

956
01:00:26.581 --> 01:00:28.917
that guarantees my client,
Tugg Speedman,

957
01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:32.796
some form of digital video recorder
on location.

958
01:00:33.547 --> 01:00:35.048
I can't believe you let him in.

959
01:00:37.592 --> 01:00:40.095
Look, fuckstick, I'm incredibly busy,
so why don't you get the hell out of here

960
01:00:40.262 --> 01:00:43.265
before I snap your dick off
and jam it into your ass?

961
01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.016
No, not you, Helen.

962
01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:48.145
But I will rip your tits off
if you don't get me those theaters.

963
01:00:49.354 --> 01:00:50.480
Perfect.

964
01:00:51.022 --> 01:00:53.358
Hey, Tuggernuts,
I've got you on speakerphone.

965
01:00:53.525 --> 01:00:55.318
I'm standing here with Les Grossman,

966
01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:58.613
and he is dying to tell you
why he's apparently wiped his ass

967
01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:01.074
with the TiVo clause from your contract.

968
01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:03.869
We are Flaming Dragon.

969
01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:06.413
Speedman is with us now.

970
01:01:07.122 --> 01:01:10.333
For 50 million, you will get him back.

971
01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:12.586
- Are you gonna get those...
- Who is this?

972
01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:15.297
- And how did you get this phone?
- We are Flaming Dragon!

973
01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:17.465
Simple Jack belong to us now.

974
01:01:20.218 --> 01:01:21.636
He does, does he?

975
01:01:22.304 --> 01:01:24.723
Let me tell you something, shitbird.

976
01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:27.267
I've never even heard
of your little agency.

977
01:01:27.642 --> 01:01:29.477
But if you think
you can poach my client...

978
01:01:29.644 --> 01:01:33.982
Send $50 million, or you no see
Simple Jack again because we kill him.

979
01:01:34.149 --> 01:01:35.567
This is Les Grossman. Who is this?

980
01:01:35.901 --> 01:01:37.986
This is Flaming Dragon!

981
01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:40.822
Okay. Flaming Dragon. Fuckface.

982
01:01:40.989 --> 01:01:46.119
First, take a big step back
and literally fuck your own face!

983
01:01:47.495 --> 01:01:49.873
Now, I don't know what kind of
pan-Pacific bullshit power play

984
01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.626
you're trying to pull here,
but Asia, Jack, is my territory.

985
01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:54.002
So whatever you're thinking,
you better think again.

986
01:01:54.169 --> 01:01:55.503
Otherwise, I'm gonna
have to head down there,

987
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:58.757
and I will rain down an ungodly
fucking firestorm upon you.

988
01:01:58.924 --> 01:02:00.508
You're gonna have to call
the fucking United Nations

989
01:02:00.675 --> 01:02:04.638
and get a fucking binding resolution
to keep me from fucking destroying you.

990
01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:07.474
I am talking scorched earth,
motherfucker!

991
01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:09.184
I will massacre you!

992
01:02:09.517 --> 01:02:11.603
I will fuck you up!

993
01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:21.321
- Could you find out who that was? Go.
- Yeah. Yeah.

994
01:02:56.523 --> 01:02:58.650
You wear these.
More like Simple Jack teeth.

995
01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:00.986
Okay.

996
01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:03.822
Hey. Look, I know you're a big fan,
and that's great...

997
01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.535
Put teeth in!

998
01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:17.419
Now do movie.

999
01:03:17.752 --> 01:03:19.212
The whole movie?

1000
01:03:19.379 --> 01:03:21.214
I can't. I don't know the whole...

1001
01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:24.175
You perform! You perform or die!

1002
01:03:24.592 --> 01:03:25.885
Monkey swine!

1003
01:03:28.888 --> 01:03:29.889
Pa.

1004
01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:33.560
More stupid!

1005
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:40.817
Pa, why you gotta make me feel bad?

1006
01:03:43.153 --> 01:03:44.404
You saw what I saw.

1007
01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:46.740
Tugg Speedman is dead meat
if we don't do something soon.

1008
01:03:46.906 --> 01:03:49.200
Yeah. We could do something
by getting our asses back to the hotel,

1009
01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:50.618
which is in the other direction!

1010
01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:52.037
Ain't right.

1011
01:03:52.787 --> 01:03:54.456
What would've happened
in The Great Escape

1012
01:03:54.622 --> 01:03:58.418
if Steve McQueen and them dudes
had turned tail and ran?

1013
01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:02.839
Well, that's what that movie was about.
They were escaping. They ran away.

1014
01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:05.550
I'm trying to agree with you.
The point is they did something.

1015
01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:06.885
Then what are we supposed to do?

1016
01:04:07.052 --> 01:04:09.846
'Cause he's cleaning a gun
with no bullets. Yeah, that's a plan.

1017
01:04:11.014 --> 01:04:14.851
I'm just like a little boy,
playing with his dick when he's nervous.

1018
01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:19.773
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1019
01:04:20.982 --> 01:04:23.985
I got an idea.
This might be a little crazy.

1020
01:04:24.152 --> 01:04:25.445
Crazy's better than nothing.

1021
01:04:26.237 --> 01:04:30.116
Back in '93, I did a low-budget
titty comedy for Skinemax.

1022
01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:33.536
- Sex Camp. Remember it?
- Yeah.

1023
01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:37.582
Anyway, me and the campers
from the uncool camp

1024
01:04:37.749 --> 01:04:40.251
had to break into the rich girl camp.

1025
01:04:40.418 --> 01:04:42.045
So, what we did,

1026
01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:45.131
we built a catapult
out of logs and underwear,

1027
01:04:45.298 --> 01:04:48.885
and they shot us over the wall,
and we parachuted down.

1028
01:04:54.474 --> 01:04:55.767
Look,

1029
01:04:55.934 --> 01:04:59.145
- you guys, we already know the plan.
- Fine.

1030
01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:03.650
We do it just like in the book,
Chapter 26, the Wet Offensive.

1031
01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:05.860
The book of Tropic Thunder.

1032
01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:08.530
Yeah, did you guys read the book?

1033
01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:12.325
The flap, I read the back flap
and saw the pictures.

1034
01:05:13.243 --> 01:05:16.287
Well, it's okay.
It's exactly the same as in the script.

1035
01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:17.539
Cool.

1036
01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:21.376
You guys all read the script, right?

1037
01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:23.878
I don't read the script, script reads me.

1038
01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:26.840
What the hell does that even mean?

1039
01:05:27.006 --> 01:05:30.385
What you getting at with the books,
scripts? Spit that shit out, man!

1040
01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.557
All right. The Wet Offensive.

1041
01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:39.185
Osiris and Fats go undercover
as a diversion.

1042
01:05:39.561 --> 01:05:41.813
Motown and Brooklyn sneak in
via the river.

1043
01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:44.399
Yeah. But those dudes
was trained soldiers.

1044
01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:46.943
Yeah!

1045
01:05:48.403 --> 01:05:50.530
And we trained actors, motherfucker.

1046
01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:55.785
Time to man up.
And I ain't gonna sugarcoat.

1047
01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:58.621
Some of us
might not even make it back.

1048
01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:02.125
What do you mean?
Like not on the same flight?

1049
01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:07.589
Alpa and I's already wearing
earth mama's natural night camo.

1050
01:06:07.755 --> 01:06:09.299
- Cool it, Benson.
- Sorry.

1051
01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:14.888
We gonna scout, get a plan together.
We ain't back in 20, come looking.

1052
01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:18.266
We are Flaming Dragon.

1053
01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.188
Okay-

1054
01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:27.525
Flaming Dragon's
a heroin manufacturer.

1055
01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:30.695
They're responsible
for an eighth of the drug trade in Asia.

1056
01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:33.781
- Huge profit margin.
- Guys!

1057
01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:37.118
Would somebody please let me know
what the game plan is?

1058
01:06:37.285 --> 01:06:38.953
Peck! We have it handled.

1059
01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.873
Please, don't interrupt.
Everything's under control.

1060
01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.708
I got it. Got it.

1061
01:06:56.095 --> 01:06:58.056
- Les Grossman.
- We not get money yet.

1062
01:06:58.556 --> 01:07:00.642
Price now 100 million!

1063
01:07:00.808 --> 01:07:03.561
You pay now,
or tomorrow Simple Jack die.

1064
01:07:03.728 --> 01:07:06.731
Great. Let me get this down.

1065
01:07:06.898 --> 01:07:08.274
100 million.

1066
01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:11.319
Wait! I got a better idea.

1067
01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:13.696
Instead of 100 million,

1068
01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:16.449
how about I send you
a hobo's dick cheese?

1069
01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:19.077
Then you kill him! Do your thing!
Skin the fucking bastard!

1070
01:07:19.244 --> 01:07:21.371
Go to town, man! Go to town!

1071
01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:23.289
- No...
- In the meantime, and as usual,

1072
01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:25.500
go fuck yourself!

1073
01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:29.170
- No.
- We don't negotiate with terrorists.

1074
01:07:31.256 --> 01:07:33.925
Hey, hey, are you insane?

1075
01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:35.843
- I think I could've done that better.
- I thought it was good.

1076
01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:37.303
They're gonna kill him!

1077
01:07:43.184 --> 01:07:46.396
And we'll weep for him, in the press.

1078
01:07:47.313 --> 01:07:49.399
Set up a scholarship in his name.

1079
01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:53.528
Eventually, and I'm talking way,
way down the road,

1080
01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:55.530
we file an insurance claim.

1081
01:07:55.697 --> 01:07:58.408
Preferably before
the end of the fiscal year.

1082
01:07:58.575 --> 01:08:02.328
Actually, the claim alone would net us
more than the movie would lose.

1083
01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:06.207
You can't be serious.

1084
01:08:08.126 --> 01:08:09.752
Let's face it.

1085
01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:13.965
The kids aren't dressing up as Scorcher
for Purim anymore.

1086
01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:18.303
Speedman is a dying star,

1087
01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:21.598
a white dwarf heading for a black hole.

1088
01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:23.933
That's physics. It's inevitable.

1089
01:08:24.601 --> 01:08:27.604
We've been handed
an incredible opportunity here, Peck.

1090
01:08:28.062 --> 01:08:31.399
The universe is talking to us right now.

1091
01:08:31.983 --> 01:08:33.443
You just gotta listen.

1092
01:08:46.664 --> 01:08:50.043
See, this is the good part, Pecker.
This is when the job gets fun.

1093
01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:51.210
Yeah.

1094
01:08:51.544 --> 01:08:54.714
Ask and you shall receive.

1095
01:08:55.757 --> 01:08:59.802
- All right.
- You play ball, we play ball.

1096
01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:03.264
I know you want the goodies.

1097
01:09:03.431 --> 01:09:04.974
Welcome to the goody room.

1098
01:09:05.558 --> 01:09:09.937
You paying attention?
'Cause I'm talking G5 for the Pecker.

1099
01:09:10.271 --> 01:09:11.272
That's how you're gonna roll.

1100
01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:14.692
No more frequent flyer
bitch miles for my boy.

1101
01:09:15.735 --> 01:09:17.028
Yeah!

1102
01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:18.780
Playa.

1103
01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:20.990
Playa!

1104
01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:23.284
Big dick playa.

1105
01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:25.119
Swinging past your knees!

1106
01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:26.496
Big dick, baby.

1107
01:09:26.663 --> 01:09:27.830
Yep.

1108
01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.711
Or you can grow a conscience

1109
01:09:33.878 --> 01:09:36.255
in the next five minutes
and see where that takes you.

1110
01:09:41.219 --> 01:09:42.679
Let me get this straight.

1111
01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:46.974
You want me
to let my client of 15 years,

1112
01:09:47.141 --> 01:09:48.434
one of my best friends,

1113
01:09:48.601 --> 01:09:53.272
die in the jungle, alone,
for some money and a G5?

1114
01:09:54.399 --> 01:09:55.525
Yes.

1115
01:10:00.571 --> 01:10:02.865
A G5 airplane?

1116
01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:06.035
Yes.

1117
01:10:07.078 --> 01:10:09.789
And lots of money.

1118
01:10:11.165 --> 01:10:13.334
Playa.

1119
01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:17.422
Yeah!

1120
01:10:18.631 --> 01:10:21.509
Smack it up, flip it, rub it down!

1121
01:10:23.803 --> 01:10:26.472
But Mama take care of Jack a lot.

1122
01:10:27.306 --> 01:10:30.977
How many more sleeps
before she wakes up again?

1123
01:10:31.185 --> 01:10:32.603
Sorry, Jack.

1124
01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:35.064
She in heaven now.

1125
01:10:35.815 --> 01:10:39.026
Damn! I thought the movie was bad.

1126
01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.779
She sleep forever.

1127
01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:45.491
To the man's credit, he's actually
eased up on the retard throttle.

1128
01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:49.162
And now that's added a balance,
and the audience can connect.

1129
01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:50.997
I mean, this is Theater 101,

1130
01:10:51.164 --> 01:10:53.082
but, you know, the guy's had...
he's had a tough road.

1131
01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:54.333
He'll become a naturalist.

1132
01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.127
- Yeah.
- Break down the aesthetic distance,

1133
01:10:56.294 --> 01:10:58.004
then the...

1134
01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.300
Told you I'd tag you back.

1135
01:11:04.969 --> 01:11:06.679
Can I tell you that I'm sorry

1136
01:11:07.346 --> 01:11:09.599
for any offense I might've caused, man?

1137
01:11:09.974 --> 01:11:12.059
- I just got caught up in...
- In being a dumb-ass?

1138
01:11:12.226 --> 01:11:13.561
I guess so.

1139
01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:16.647
Why you still doing this
Chicken George shit, I have no idea.

1140
01:11:16.814 --> 01:11:18.024
- Neither do I.
- It's beyond me.

1141
01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:20.318
- It's beyond me.
- You confused.

1142
01:11:20.485 --> 01:11:22.153
- I am a little confused.
- I know.

1143
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:25.490
But are we cool?

1144
01:11:25.823 --> 01:11:26.991
Not really.

1145
01:11:31.037 --> 01:11:32.580
Hey, man.

1146
01:11:32.747 --> 01:11:34.373
- How's it going?
- Good. Yourself?

1147
01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:36.501
Hey, so, if it's no big deal,

1148
01:11:36.667 --> 01:11:39.045
I think I'm just gonna hang back here
for the mission.

1149
01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:41.214
Watch the stuff.

1150
01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.341
- Is that cool?
- What? No!

1151
01:11:43.508 --> 01:11:45.343
We need you, Jeff.

1152
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:47.053
What are you talking about?

1153
01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:48.763
Okay, look, man.

1154
01:11:50.014 --> 01:11:52.308
- I got something to tell you.
- Okay.

1155
01:11:54.519 --> 01:11:56.687
You know those jellybeans
I was eating?

1156
01:11:57.355 --> 01:12:00.483
Well, they weren't jellybeans, okay?

1157
01:12:01.359 --> 01:12:03.694
- They were drugs.
- Really?

1158
01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:08.574
I get down there near the mother lode,
I am done. I'm jonesing bad, man.

1159
01:12:08.741 --> 01:12:11.661
I'm gonna fucking do all the heroin
in the fucking world.

1160
01:12:14.956 --> 01:12:19.126
If you guys wanna make it through
this thing, you gotta strap me to a tree.

1161
01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:24.215
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious. Literally, a tree.

1162
01:12:24.382 --> 01:12:27.176
And you can, no matter what, you can't
fucking untie me until it is done,

1163
01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:28.845
until it is out of my system.

1164
01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.555
I'm gonna say,
"Hey, man, I'm cool. It's cool."

1165
01:12:30.721 --> 01:12:32.223
"I'm finally better. I'm finally better.
Untie me."

1166
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:35.059
Don't listen to me!
Anything I fucking say is a lie!

1167
01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:37.061
You got it!

1168
01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:39.689
Goodbye, Mama!

1169
01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:42.942
Now you can have ice cream in heaven.

1170
01:12:43.109 --> 01:12:48.072
I'll see you tonight, when I go to bed,
in my head movies.

1171
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:53.619
But this head movie
makes my eyes rain.

1172
01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:05.882
Dang. Gilligan catching a kidney shot.

1173
01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:10.219
- They got him on the move!
- That's torture, man.

1174
01:13:10.678 --> 01:13:13.472
Okay. That's where they keeping him.

1175
01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:15.391
I gotta get cracking on my costume.

1176
01:13:15.933 --> 01:13:17.268
Say, are you good
with a needle and thread?

1177
01:13:17.435 --> 01:13:18.394
Hell, yeah.

1178
01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:21.814
Alpa Chino chinos sold more than
five million pairs last spring at the Gap.

1179
01:13:21.981 --> 01:13:24.400
- I sewed them patterns myself, baby.
- Let's roll out.

1180
01:13:56.682 --> 01:13:58.893
It's a little twig man Oscar.

1181
01:14:05.483 --> 01:14:07.902
I'm going to call you Half Squat.

1182
01:14:09.612 --> 01:14:11.572
And you can call me...

1183
01:14:12.615 --> 01:14:13.616
Papa.

1184
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:39.141
Look at all those stars.

1185
01:14:41.102 --> 01:14:43.062
Really makes a guy feel pretty small.

1186
01:14:44.605 --> 01:14:46.816
This could be the last time
we look at these stars.

1187
01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:49.610
Man, that's beauty.

1188
01:14:51.529 --> 01:14:54.198
Nights like tonight
make a man wonder what it's all about.

1189
01:14:54.865 --> 01:14:56.993
Hey, you guys.
Anybody got some bug spray?

1190
01:14:58.828 --> 01:14:59.912
Don't ignore me!

1191
01:15:00.079 --> 01:15:02.957
Stick it out, man.
We're gonna get through this.

1192
01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:06.085
- Hey, Kirk?
- Yeah?

1193
01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:09.005
Are you still dating
Jennifer Love Hewitt?

1194
01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:10.506
'Cause I think she's hot.

1195
01:15:10.881 --> 01:15:14.176
No, that was just some
tabloid conjecture.

1196
01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:18.347
Hey, guys, I'm good. I made it through.
You can untie me now.

1197
01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:20.224
Funny?

1198
01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:23.769
The circus life 280 days a year
on location.

1199
01:15:24.979 --> 01:15:27.898
It's hard to find a girl
that can hang with that, you know?

1200
01:15:29.692 --> 01:15:31.527
Not one worth keeping, nohow.

1201
01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:34.071
Hey, Radar? Evans?

1202
01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:35.364
No, it's Kevin.

1203
01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:37.074
Kev, whatever the fuck.
Come over here.

1204
01:15:37.241 --> 01:15:39.410
I didn't tell you, but Fatties: Fart Three
is coming down the pike,

1205
01:15:39.577 --> 01:15:42.997
and there's a role in there for you
if you come over and untie me.

1206
01:15:43.164 --> 01:15:45.666
Jeff, you're just going to
have to tough it out.

1207
01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:47.793
Your mother's a cankerous whore!

1208
01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.086
Jesus, man.

1209
01:15:50.337 --> 01:15:51.464
Hey, man.

1210
01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:54.633
Remember way back when I said
your mother was a cankerous whore?

1211
01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:58.054
I'm sorry, man.
I did not mean that. She's not.

1212
01:15:58.387 --> 01:15:59.847
How about you, man?

1213
01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:02.600
You got some little minx waiting for you
on the other side of tomorrow?

1214
01:16:02.767 --> 01:16:03.976
Me?

1215
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:07.104
I've barely even had a girlfriend, and...

1216
01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:11.525
I was really hoping I'd get laid
when this movie came out,

1217
01:16:11.692 --> 01:16:14.111
but that's not gonna happen.

1218
01:16:14.945 --> 01:16:16.363
What about you, Masterblaster?

1219
01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:19.075
You got a certain someone you trying
to get with back in the States?

1220
01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:23.913
What, Alpa Chino?
He's like 10 girls deep, 24/7.

1221
01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.247
No. You missing me, man.

1222
01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:26.999
I'm talking about something special.
Big difference.

1223
01:16:27.166 --> 01:16:28.167
How about it?

1224
01:16:29.293 --> 01:16:30.419
Yeah.

1225
01:16:31.796 --> 01:16:33.130
Yeah, there is.

1226
01:16:33.881 --> 01:16:36.759
Well? What's the skinny?
Y'all been on a date or what?

1227
01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:39.136
No. I mean...

1228
01:16:39.303 --> 01:16:43.933
I always wanted to, but I guess
I just never had the courage to ask.

1229
01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:45.893
It's... It's complicated.

1230
01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:48.395
No! It's simple as pie, man.

1231
01:16:48.562 --> 01:16:51.107
You plant your feet in the ground, you
look her square in the eyes, you say,

1232
01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:54.360
"Hey, baby, you and me's going
on a date." That's the end of story.

1233
01:16:55.027 --> 01:16:57.363
- What's her name?
- Lance.

1234
01:16:57.822 --> 01:16:59.573
"Listen here, Lance..."

1235
01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:04.203
Lance? What the fuck did I just hear?
Lance?

1236
01:17:04.537 --> 01:17:05.996
- Did you say "Lance"?
- No!

1237
01:17:06.163 --> 01:17:08.040
- That sounded like "Lance."
- No, I said "Nance."

1238
01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:10.334
- That's what I said, "Nance."
- It sounded like "Lance."

1239
01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:11.919
Look, I'm Alpa Chino, okay?

1240
01:17:12.128 --> 01:17:13.712
I love the pussy! All right?

1241
01:17:13.879 --> 01:17:15.756
Lay your ass back down
and look at the stars.

1242
01:17:15.923 --> 01:17:17.174
When you wrote I Love Tha Pussy

1243
01:17:17.341 --> 01:17:20.636
was you thinking of dangling your dice
on Lance's forehead?

1244
01:17:20.845 --> 01:17:23.097
No, hell, no! What? Come on. Look.

1245
01:17:23.264 --> 01:17:26.142
- Man, everyone's gay once in a while.
- I'm not gay!

1246
01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:27.309
This Hollywood.

1247
01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:28.561
How about we all get back to work?

1248
01:17:28.727 --> 01:17:30.229
- Okay. Cool.
- This is ridiculous!

1249
01:17:30.396 --> 01:17:33.274
We got a big day tomorrow.
Let's get focused.

1250
01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:40.614
Alpa, if you untie me,
I will literally suck your dick right now.

1251
01:17:40.781 --> 01:17:44.034
I told you, for the last time,
I love the pussy!

1252
01:17:45.369 --> 01:17:47.913
I'll cradle the balls, stroke the shaft,

1253
01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:51.333
work the pipe and swallow the gravy.

1254
01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.586
Get it over here, buddy. Let's do this.

1255
01:18:00.134 --> 01:18:01.135
Okay, so, what's the plan?

1256
01:18:01.302 --> 01:18:02.636
Are you gonna talk Vietnamese
to those dudes?

1257
01:18:02.803 --> 01:18:04.513
No. No. Mandarin Chinese.

1258
01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.307
Which, from what I can tell,
is what they speaking down there.

1259
01:18:06.473 --> 01:18:07.975
How the hell do you know Chinese?

1260
01:18:08.142 --> 01:18:11.562
Land of Silk and Money with Gong Li.
Second Globe, third Oscar.

1261
01:18:11.729 --> 01:18:15.608
Prepped for that one by working in a
Beijing textile factory for eight months.

1262
01:18:15.774 --> 01:18:17.735
That might be our ride.

1263
01:18:27.661 --> 01:18:28.662
The straps are too tight!

1264
01:18:28.829 --> 01:18:31.207
Shut your mouth and follow my lead.

1265
01:19:24.051 --> 01:19:25.219
Okay.

1266
01:19:27.805 --> 01:19:28.931
All right.

1267
01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:31.433
That looks like it could be
the munitions hut right there.

1268
01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.644
I'm gonna try to find Speedman
in the main building.

1269
01:19:53.122 --> 01:19:54.707
Get over here!

1270
01:19:56.083 --> 01:19:57.835
- What are you guys doing here?
- He has hands.

1271
01:19:58.002 --> 01:20:00.087
- He killed Damien.
- Bullshit!

1272
01:20:00.504 --> 01:20:02.673
- He blinded Jamie Lee Curtis.
- Almost!

1273
01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:05.968
What are you talking about?
Damien stepped on a old landmine.

1274
01:20:06.343 --> 01:20:07.928
Sweet. Thank God.

1275
01:20:08.095 --> 01:20:10.014
- We busting Speedman out.
- Speedman's here?

1276
01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:20.941
They got my boom boom up here.

1277
01:20:21.108 --> 01:20:23.652
I take it y'all are doing
the Wet Offensive from the book.

1278
01:20:24.028 --> 01:20:25.029
I can give y'all a diversion.

1279
01:20:25.195 --> 01:20:29.325
I got enough shit here to light this place
up like it's the Fourth of fucking July.

1280
01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:13.535
Yes, your farm.

1281
01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:20.084
Where is your farm,

1282
01:21:21.627 --> 01:21:22.836
American?

1283
01:21:25.923 --> 01:21:26.924
My farm?

1284
01:21:29.009 --> 01:21:30.135
Shit.

1285
01:21:31.095 --> 01:21:32.930
Here's my motherfucking farm!

1286
01:21:34.348 --> 01:21:36.558
Yeah!

1287
01:21:40.604 --> 01:21:44.149
Yeah! Chicka-chickaw, baby!

1288
01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:46.276
Kwan-Lo!

1289
01:21:47.653 --> 01:21:49.571
I'm a lead farmer, motherfucker!

1290
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:51.240
Yeah!

1291
01:21:52.783 --> 01:21:55.911
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
keep your head down!

1292
01:21:56.078 --> 01:21:58.288
Keep your head down on the ground!

1293
01:21:58.455 --> 01:22:00.541
Nobody move or I do the little big guy!

1294
01:22:00.707 --> 01:22:02.876
That's right,
we running this program now, J.P.

1295
01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:05.879
Now show me where the drugs are.

1296
01:22:06.964 --> 01:22:08.006
What the fuck?

1297
01:22:08.882 --> 01:22:10.092
That ain't the plan!

1298
01:22:10.676 --> 01:22:12.970
Don't judge me!

1299
01:22:16.056 --> 01:22:17.808
He's got a real serious problem.

1300
01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.269
Hey! Hey, you!

1301
01:22:20.978 --> 01:22:22.229
Take off your clothes!

1302
01:22:23.272 --> 01:22:24.898
Take off your clothes!

1303
01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:26.275
What do we do now?

1304
01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:28.235
Stick with the plan. Find Speedman.

1305
01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:30.696
Alpa, keep this clown posse down.
Come on now.

1306
01:22:30.863 --> 01:22:33.157
Y'all heard the man.
Be suede, don't move!

1307
01:22:34.366 --> 01:22:36.201
Fuck your do-rag. Fuck your do-rag.

1308
01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:38.454
- Door!
- One, two, three!

1309
01:22:52.134 --> 01:22:53.969
I go high, you go low.

1310
01:22:58.599 --> 01:23:01.894
Get down. Get down! Get down!
Chow Yun-Fat, get the hell down!

1311
01:23:02.269 --> 01:23:05.564
If I see one more head pop up,
it's gonna be bullet Whac-A-Mole.

1312
01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:08.400
Come on, come on!

1313
01:23:08.692 --> 01:23:10.694
- Smoke grenade.
- Don't drop it now.

1314
01:23:11.361 --> 01:23:12.863
Here.

1315
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:15.365
- What's this?
- I don't know what it's called.

1316
01:23:15.532 --> 01:23:18.035
I just know the sound it makes
when it lies.

1317
01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:21.246
Don't move, Matchbox,
or I will shoot you.

1318
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:24.333
I'm gonna put on this thing. Don't move.

1319
01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:26.543
I can still see you.

1320
01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:33.800
Tugg!

1321
01:23:36.303 --> 01:23:37.471
Tugg?

1322
01:23:39.556 --> 01:23:40.599
Gotcha.

1323
01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:44.019
Roll your shit up, man. We going home.

1324
01:23:44.937 --> 01:23:46.063
Home?

1325
01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:51.944
But I'm doing five shows a day
for a standing-room-only crowd.

1326
01:23:52.277 --> 01:23:54.696
Don't you get it? I already am home.

1327
01:23:57.199 --> 01:23:59.201
All right, now, dude, you gotta get it...

1328
01:24:00.202 --> 01:24:02.329
My son gave this to me.

1329
01:24:02.496 --> 01:24:05.749
- That's your stick buddy?
- His name is Twigman.

1330
01:24:06.124 --> 01:24:07.960
Does he wanna come with us?

1331
01:24:28.522 --> 01:24:29.898
Get the hell down!

1332
01:24:30.232 --> 01:24:33.068
What you doing? What you doing?
Don't touch that gun.

1333
01:24:33.235 --> 01:24:34.736
Don't do it! Don't touch that gun!

1334
01:24:34.903 --> 01:24:36.530
On my momma, if you touch that gun...

1335
01:24:41.952 --> 01:24:44.079
- Shit, it's on!
- Over here!

1336
01:25:15.569 --> 01:25:16.653
Shadow me, Pinocchio!

1337
01:25:17.529 --> 01:25:18.739
Smoke!

1338
01:25:24.578 --> 01:25:26.288
Shit!

1339
01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:32.169
Jeff, don't!

1340
01:25:33.462 --> 01:25:35.422
It doesn't matter what I do.

1341
01:25:35.589 --> 01:25:38.467
I'll always be a screw-up.
No one'll ever respect me.

1342
01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:42.596
That is not true, you are not a screw-up!
You make so many people laugh.

1343
01:25:42.763 --> 01:25:44.723
They only laugh at my farts.

1344
01:25:45.098 --> 01:25:47.017
Jeff, we really need to go now!

1345
01:25:47.392 --> 01:25:49.102
This is all I deserve!

1346
01:26:09.081 --> 01:26:10.791
Laugh at that, you bastards!

1347
01:26:11.541 --> 01:26:15.003
Hilarious! Hilarious!

1348
01:26:16.505 --> 01:26:19.341
Let's move. We only have 16 hours
before they wake up.

1349
01:26:26.932 --> 01:26:28.475
Sounds like the dinner bell's ringing.

1350
01:26:28.642 --> 01:26:31.603
These assholes are gonna be crawling
in here ready to fucking eat us.

1351
01:26:34.523 --> 01:26:36.566
There. All right, you keep six right here.

1352
01:26:39.319 --> 01:26:40.320
Come on, let's go.

1353
01:26:41.571 --> 01:26:43.407
Come on, what are you guys doing?
Let's get out of here!

1354
01:26:43.615 --> 01:26:45.200
He's on tilt status.

1355
01:26:45.367 --> 01:26:49.287
Same thing happened to me when
I played Neil Armstrong in Moonshot.

1356
01:26:49.454 --> 01:26:51.498
They found me in an alley in Burbank

1357
01:26:51.665 --> 01:26:54.876
trying to re-enter the Earth's
atmosphere in an old refrigerator box.

1358
01:27:00.382 --> 01:27:02.551
Give me the flame thrower.
You gotta start the chopper.

1359
01:27:02.718 --> 01:27:06.179
- No, fuck that! Just give me this.
- No time! I'll take care of this!

1360
01:27:07.389 --> 01:27:09.224
All right. Give me your hooks.

1361
01:27:09.391 --> 01:27:10.934
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna put them on again.

1362
01:27:11.101 --> 01:27:13.895
- Just give me your goddamn hooks.
- All right. Here.

1363
01:27:14.104 --> 01:27:16.106
Get those boys back to the bird, pronto!

1364
01:27:20.819 --> 01:27:22.195
Fuck! Enough!

1365
01:27:23.238 --> 01:27:24.239
Fake shit!

1366
01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:29.536
Fuck!

1367
01:27:37.085 --> 01:27:40.338
Go get your guys!
Get them to the chopper!

1368
01:27:40.505 --> 01:27:42.632
I'll take care of these yahoos!

1369
01:27:44.634 --> 01:27:46.845
You're gonna focus up now,
motherfucker, and say it.

1370
01:27:47.012 --> 01:27:49.097
- "It's me, Tugg!"
- It's me, Tugg.

1371
01:27:49.264 --> 01:27:50.724
That's right! Now, Tugg who?

1372
01:27:50.891 --> 01:27:53.560
- Tugg who? I don't know. Who are you?
- Me?

1373
01:27:53.727 --> 01:27:55.353
I know who I am!

1374
01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:58.732
I'm a dude playing a dude
disguised as another dude.

1375
01:27:59.232 --> 01:28:00.233
What?

1376
01:28:00.525 --> 01:28:02.569
You a dude
that don't know what dude he is!

1377
01:28:02.736 --> 01:28:05.363
Or are you a dude who has no idea
what dude he is

1378
01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:06.948
and claims to know what dude he is...

1379
01:28:07.115 --> 01:28:08.575
What the fuck
are you guys talking about?

1380
01:28:08.742 --> 01:28:09.785
By playing other dudes?

1381
01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:11.077
I know what dude I am!

1382
01:28:11.244 --> 01:28:13.997
- You're scared.
- I ain't scared. Scared of what?

1383
01:28:14.164 --> 01:28:15.332
Or scared of who?

1384
01:28:15.499 --> 01:28:18.043
- Scared of who?
- Come on, guys. We really need to go!

1385
01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:19.503
Scared of you.

1386
01:28:24.382 --> 01:28:26.384
- Jesus.
- What's going on?

1387
01:28:26.802 --> 01:28:28.261
The dudes are emerging.

1388
01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:29.805
He's right, you know.

1389
01:28:31.556 --> 01:28:33.225
I am not...

1390
01:28:34.518 --> 01:28:36.228
Sergeant Lincoln Osiris.

1391
01:28:40.607 --> 01:28:41.691
We gotta roll out.

1392
01:28:42.192 --> 01:28:45.403
Nor am I Father O'Malley.

1393
01:28:47.656 --> 01:28:50.575
Or Neil Armstrong.

1394
01:28:58.166 --> 01:29:00.335
I think I might be nobody.

1395
01:29:02.963 --> 01:29:05.674
The insecurity level
with you guys is ridiculous!

1396
01:29:06.925 --> 01:29:09.803
- Everybody's got issues!
- Yeah, man, everybody got issues.

1397
01:29:09.970 --> 01:29:12.472
Come on! You're Kirk Lazarus.

1398
01:29:12.639 --> 01:29:14.766
You're the whole reason
I got into acting.

1399
01:29:14.933 --> 01:29:16.685
I memorized every single monologue

1400
01:29:16.852 --> 01:29:19.396
you ever did
when I was in theater school.

1401
01:29:19.563 --> 01:29:21.523
- Really?
- Yeah. And look, Tugg!

1402
01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:24.067
I saw Scorcher I
24 times when I was in eighth grade.

1403
01:29:24.234 --> 01:29:27.112
That shit blew me away!
I got high to that shit! You the man!

1404
01:29:27.279 --> 01:29:30.323
Yeah, man, Scorcher I was great.
Let's get the fuck out of here!

1405
01:29:30.490 --> 01:29:34.578
Tugg, Tugger, you're the last piece
of the puzzle, buddy.

1406
01:29:34.911 --> 01:29:37.747
We need you! Your men need you!
Are you with us?

1407
01:29:42.085 --> 01:29:43.712
I'm a rooster illusion.

1408
01:29:44.170 --> 01:29:45.422
Fuck it. We'll deal with him later.

1409
01:29:45.589 --> 01:29:48.884
Let's move. Come on. Come on.
Double time. Gotta go!

1410
01:29:51.177 --> 01:29:52.971
Come on, come on, come on.

1411
01:29:56.766 --> 01:29:58.685
Bingo! Move out.

1412
01:30:00.604 --> 01:30:01.980
God.

1413
01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:06.818
Just say no to this,
you drug-making midget.

1414
01:30:11.489 --> 01:30:12.532
God, hold on!

1415
01:30:18.997 --> 01:30:20.373
Four Leaf!

1416
01:30:25.128 --> 01:30:26.463
You grew hands?

1417
01:30:35.931 --> 01:30:37.223
RPG, gentlemen!

1418
01:30:39.976 --> 01:30:41.519
Where are you going?

1419
01:30:47.025 --> 01:30:49.778
My God.
I am moving to catering after this.

1420
01:31:11.841 --> 01:31:13.176
My ass!

1421
01:31:16.137 --> 01:31:17.847
My ass!

1422
01:31:19.432 --> 01:31:22.519
Hey, yo!
We gotta get our shit together, Tugg!

1423
01:31:22.686 --> 01:31:24.604
We gotta get his cracker ass
to the chopper!

1424
01:31:24.771 --> 01:31:28.733
Are you still crazy?
We gotta get Candisky to the chopper!

1425
01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:30.610
It's Sandusky.

1426
01:31:32.821 --> 01:31:35.699
- Kevin Sandusky.
- My name.

1427
01:31:35.865 --> 01:31:37.283
You remembered my name.

1428
01:31:37.575 --> 01:31:39.536
Alpa, go help Cody.

1429
01:31:39.953 --> 01:31:42.163
Portnoy, get Sandusky
back to the chopper-Go!

1430
01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:43.665
- I got him!
- Let's go!

1431
01:31:45.083 --> 01:31:46.251
Let's get out of here!

1432
01:31:58.471 --> 01:31:59.931
Hey, Leaf!

1433
01:32:00.306 --> 01:32:01.266
- Leaf!
- Yeah.

1434
01:32:01.433 --> 01:32:02.434
Hit the plunger

1435
01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.269
- as soon as they clear the bridge!
- Got it!

1436
01:32:05.729 --> 01:32:07.647
Come on! Get in the chopper!

1437
01:32:08.648 --> 01:32:11.443
- Come on! Move!
- Kirk! Wait!

1438
01:32:14.446 --> 01:32:17.407
- What the hell is he doing?
- Laz, I'm gonna blow the bridge!

1439
01:32:17.574 --> 01:32:18.867
Leaf's about to blow the bridge.
Come on!

1440
01:32:19.034 --> 01:32:21.119
You don't have to! You don't have to!
I'm staying.

1441
01:32:21.703 --> 01:32:23.121
No, I can't let you do that, mate.
We gotta go.

1442
01:32:23.288 --> 01:32:25.749
No, I'm telling you, I'm not being crazy.
They'll listen to me.

1443
01:32:25.915 --> 01:32:28.668
I know it sounds weird,
but I have a connection with them.

1444
01:32:28.835 --> 01:32:32.547
- Get over here!
- I have a son now. Little Half Squat.

1445
01:32:32.797 --> 01:32:34.299
Who in crikey fuck is Half Squat?

1446
01:32:34.466 --> 01:32:36.634
He's my son. He's my boy!

1447
01:32:36.801 --> 01:32:38.845
He needs me. I have to go back to him.

1448
01:32:42.348 --> 01:32:43.725
You tell the world what happened here.

1449
01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:45.101
What happened here?

1450
01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:48.271
I don't know, but you need to tell them.

1451
01:32:50.648 --> 01:32:51.816
I got this.

1452
01:32:52.442 --> 01:32:53.443
Tugg!

1453
01:32:54.444 --> 01:32:58.031
You take care of the boys!
I'll deal with these guys.

1454
01:32:59.449 --> 01:33:02.035
Where is he going?
We're gonna fucking die!

1455
01:33:03.119 --> 01:33:05.663
Laz, come on. He joined the circus.
Let's go.

1456
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:06.998
- You've got hands.
- Yeah.

1457
01:33:07.165 --> 01:33:08.958
- Fuck! You've got hands?
- Come on!

1458
01:33:10.335 --> 01:33:11.419
- Come on!
- Get in!

1459
01:33:11.586 --> 01:33:13.129
- Come on!
- He's staying?

1460
01:33:13.296 --> 01:33:15.590
Go! He's a lost cause, mate!
Get out of here!

1461
01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:24.641
I was wrong! Blow the bridge!
Blow the fucking bridge!

1462
01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:31.898
I got this.

1463
01:33:32.565 --> 01:33:34.234
Leaf, no!

1464
01:34:18.069 --> 01:34:20.655
It's over! He's gone!

1465
01:34:20.822 --> 01:34:23.158
Cody! We gotta go!

1466
01:34:24.784 --> 01:34:25.785
Look.

1467
01:34:48.683 --> 01:34:49.684
Think he's done.

1468
01:34:49.934 --> 01:34:50.935
Cover me!

1469
01:34:52.437 --> 01:34:54.814
- Come on!
- Wait, come back!

1470
01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:56.774
How do we cover him?

1471
01:35:01.404 --> 01:35:04.574
All right, game over. Come on, mate.
Come on.

1472
01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:07.452
- You all right, man?
- I'm cold.

1473
01:35:07.619 --> 01:35:09.245
I can't feel my legs.

1474
01:35:09.704 --> 01:35:12.582
No, no, they're in a puddle, mate. See?
There's a puddle right there.

1475
01:35:12.957 --> 01:35:14.125
- No worries.
- Good.

1476
01:35:14.292 --> 01:35:15.293
Come on, we gotta split, man.

1477
01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:17.670
- You guys came back for me.
- Course.

1478
01:35:17.837 --> 01:35:20.131
Hey! I want you to know something.

1479
01:35:20.298 --> 01:35:21.507
What?

1480
01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.135
I know who you are.

1481
01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:28.306
You're my friend.

1482
01:35:30.767 --> 01:35:32.227
You're my brother.

1483
01:35:33.102 --> 01:35:35.855
But like a really cool brother, you know?

1484
01:35:36.022 --> 01:35:37.315
Like a brother
where there was no animosity or...

1485
01:35:37.482 --> 01:35:39.609
Don't look now,
you got some real tears going.

1486
01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:41.361
Really?

1487
01:35:41.527 --> 01:35:42.946
That's the stuff
that accolades are made of.

1488
01:35:43.321 --> 01:35:44.739
Jesus, let's go, man!

1489
01:35:44.906 --> 01:35:45.907
All right?

1490
01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:48.868
Upsy-daisy.

1491
01:35:51.162 --> 01:35:52.664
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

1492
01:35:56.084 --> 01:35:57.293
Get in! Get in!

1493
01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:59.504
Come on! Here we go!

1494
01:36:02.215 --> 01:36:04.509
Tuggernuts! I got it!

1495
01:36:07.178 --> 01:36:09.472
- Tugger!
- Rick!

1496
01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:13.268
What the fuck?

1497
01:36:13.434 --> 01:36:15.645
I got the TiVo!

1498
01:36:16.104 --> 01:36:20.775
My friend wants a TiVo,
my friend gets a TiVo!

1499
01:36:25.655 --> 01:36:27.156
Shit!

1500
01:37:03.568 --> 01:37:05.611
And the Oscar goes to...

1501
01:37:08.489 --> 01:37:10.825
Yes! Tugg Speedman.

1502
01:37:12.535 --> 01:37:14.912
Tropic Blunder,
The True Story Behind the Making

1503
01:37:15.079 --> 01:37:17.915
of the Most Expensive
Fake True War Story Ever.

1504
01:37:19.167 --> 01:37:20.335
Yeah!

1505
01:37:25.214 --> 01:37:27.175
Yeah, you son of a bitch!

1506
01:37:46.652 --> 01:37:50.948
Eight Oscars, $400 million,

1507
01:37:51.115 --> 01:37:52.867
and you saved
Tugg Speedman's career.

1508
01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:56.537
I couldn't have done it
without you, Slolom.

1509
01:37:59.165 --> 01:38:00.166
Really?

1510
01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:02.460
No, dickhead, of course I could.

1511
01:38:02.627 --> 01:38:05.213
- A nutless monkey could do your job.
- Well, I...

1512
