Are we gonna blow
this tree line or what?

180
00:10:44.403 --> 00:10:46.074
Tuk Tuk and Kim
got the blue balls here.

181
00:10:46.076 --> 00:10:47.471
I'm gonna let them
squirt if we're a go.

182
00:10:47.473 --> 00:10:49.640
Still rolling.
Dieter, can he hear me?

183
00:10:49.642 --> 00:10:52.478
That's C-4, dipshit. Put that
back. I said a detonator.

184
00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.885
I need some dudes up here who
speak American, goddamn it.

185
00:10:54.887 --> 00:10:56.549
He's making a fucking sweater
back here.

186
00:10:56.551 --> 00:10:59.117
I'm trying to put Tiger Balm
on this jungle's nuts.

187
00:10:59.119 --> 00:11:00.857
Oh, shit.
Alpa Chino hot line.

188
00:11:00.859 --> 00:11:02.319
What's up?
What's up, baby?

189
00:11:02.321 --> 00:11:04.628
What the fuck
is going on here?

190
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.128
Everyone, please shut up.

191
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.127
The jets are coming.
We only have one chance at this.

192
00:11:08.129 --> 00:11:10.066
On three, baby.
One, two, breathe.

193
00:11:10.068 --> 00:11:11.966
Look, do me a favor. I don't
want to do a countdown

194
00:11:11.968 --> 00:11:13.364
before I do the scene.
No countdown?

195
00:11:13.366 --> 00:11:15.704
No countdown. Can we just do it
off of "action"?

196
00:11:15.706 --> 00:11:17.336
Just-- In your own time. Good.

197
00:11:17.338 --> 00:11:18.907
I'm not-- I'm not a rocket
ship, okay?

198
00:11:18.909 --> 00:11:20.511
- All right, dude.
- And action.

199
00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:21.772
Whatever floats
your boat, baby.

200
00:11:21.774 --> 00:11:23.978
Fuck.

201
00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.311
Erika, get me a VitaminWater.

202
00:11:26.313 --> 00:11:28.084
You know what it is, Damien?
I'm sorry.

203
00:11:28.086 --> 00:11:30.851
Not to get into his thing,
but if I'm crying,

204
00:11:30.853 --> 00:11:32.516
should Osiris be crying too?

205
00:11:32.518 --> 00:11:34.693
No, it's everyone...
We cutting or we crying?

206
00:11:34.695 --> 00:11:36.258
No, we're crying.
Just call it, man.

207
00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.863
Kirk, y-you can cry. Tugg,
you can cry. Everybody cry.

208
00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:41.061
You know what? You see how
agitated he is now?

209
00:11:41.063 --> 00:11:42.460
I know.
Let's make lemonade.

210
00:11:42.462 --> 00:11:44.533
- Let's go to work.
- Still rolling.

211
00:11:44.535 --> 00:11:47.466
<i>- This is Falcon One.</i>
<i>- We have the ridge in sight...</i>

212
00:11:47.468 --> 00:11:50.039
Dieter, these jets are about
to crest this ridge line.

213
00:11:50.041 --> 00:11:52.140
They got about 200 pounds
of shit your pants.

214
00:11:52.142 --> 00:11:53.607
I need to know if
we're ready to go.

215
00:11:55.644 --> 00:11:56.643
You are my...

216
00:11:56.645 --> 00:11:58.014
I am your...

217
00:11:58.016 --> 00:12:00.717
See, that's what
I think it is, Damien.

218
00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:02.349
I think it's the line.
Yeah?

219
00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:04.922
I don't know if Four Leaf would
say that. Four Leaf?

220
00:12:04.924 --> 00:12:06.958
Were you crying when your hands
blew up?

221
00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.257
- No. See, he didn't.
- Yeah, I mean...

222
00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:11.889
So now we in rewrites, right?
Where are you going?

223
00:12:11.891 --> 00:12:14.162
Action Jackson can't cry.
That's what's going down.

224
00:12:14.164 --> 00:12:16.427
You know what, Kirk?
I'm ready to do the scene.

225
00:12:16.429 --> 00:12:18.662
What scene?
The scene is about emotionality.

226
00:12:18.664 --> 00:12:21.002
Where is it? Now it's time
to flip the script.

227
00:12:21.004 --> 00:12:22.401
Kirk--
Be here till Chinese New Year

228
00:12:22.403 --> 00:12:24.473
waiting for my man to cry.

229
00:12:24.475 --> 00:12:25.973
Here they come!

230
00:12:25.975 --> 00:12:27.377
Kirk, no.
Stop tailgating me,

231
00:12:27.379 --> 00:12:28.873
you pasty tea bag.

232
00:12:28.875 --> 00:12:30.107
Can I make pee-pee?

233
00:12:30.109 --> 00:12:31.175
The planes are inbound.

234
00:12:31.177 --> 00:12:33.147
I know. Oh, shit. Get the fruit.

235
00:12:33.149 --> 00:12:35.314
Jesus-- Fuck-- Shit--

236
00:12:35.316 --> 00:12:38.256

Go, go, go, go!

237
00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:39.853

239
00:12:43.561 --> 00:12:45.423
It's beautiful!

240
00:12:51.199 --> 00:12:54.405

Oh, mama.

244
00:13:03.778 --> 00:13:05.850

00:16:53.544 --> 00:16:55.643
Didn't your dog have,
like, leukemia or something

345
00:16:55.645 --> 00:16:57.811
<i>when you were a kid?</i>
<i>I mean, think of that. Boom.</i>

346
00:16:57.813 --> 00:16:59.111
End of story.

347
00:16:59.113 --> 00:17:00.245
They hook up the TiVo yet?

348
00:17:00.247 --> 00:17:01.814
<i>Uh, no.</i>
What?

349
00:17:01.816 --> 00:17:03.814
They have digital cable, but,
I mean, it's okay.

350
00:17:03.816 --> 00:17:06.790
No, no, no. Come on, man.
It's not okay.

351
00:17:06.792 --> 00:17:08.492
<i>It is not okay, Tugg.</i>

352
00:17:08.494 --> 00:17:11.690
<i>And you don't need to explain</i>
<i>to me why you need TiVo</i>

353
00:17:11.692 --> 00:17:15.662
or clean water, clean sheets,
food, shelter.

354
00:17:15.664 --> 00:17:18.500
<i>I mean, I fought for that</i>
<i>in your contract, huh?</i>

355
00:17:18.502 --> 00:17:21.232
Hey, uh, h-how's the adoption
thing coming, buddy?

356
00:17:21.234 --> 00:17:23.573
Um, not too great.

357
00:17:24.671 --> 00:17:26.711
Well, at least you get
to choose yours.

358
00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:28.841
I'm stuck with mine.

359
00:17:28.843 --> 00:17:30.413
Hm.

360
00:17:30.415 --> 00:17:32.910
<i>Tell you what, get back</i>
<i>to work, genius soldier.</i>

361
00:17:32.912 --> 00:17:36.315
The Pecker's on a TiVo mission
for the Y-O-U.

362
00:17:36.317 --> 00:17:38.215
<i>Work on those tears, my man.</i>

363
00:17:38.217 --> 00:17:39.284
All right. Yeah.

364
00:17:39.286 --> 00:17:41.124
Say it for me one time.

365
00:17:41.126 --> 00:17:43.158
You muh-muh-muh--
<i>Muh-muh-muh--</i>

366
00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.261
Make me happy.
<i>Make me happy.</i>

367
00:17:45.263 --> 00:17:47.663
<i>Love you, buddy.</i>
All right, bye.

368
00:17:47.665 --> 00:17:50.266
- Crisis meeting? What--?
- What does that mean, exactly?

369
00:17:50.268 --> 00:17:51.663
I mean, you know,
are we in a crisis?

370
00:17:51.665 --> 00:17:53.436
He's the head of the studio.

371
00:17:53.438 --> 00:17:55.204
He's reaching out.
We're 10,000 miles away.

372
00:17:55.206 --> 00:17:57.075
He just wants
a little face time.

373
00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:58.506
It's just you said he called it

374
00:17:58.508 --> 00:18:00.912
a crisis meeting, so--
It's Les Grossman.

375
00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:02.345
He throws
these words around.

376
00:18:02.347 --> 00:18:06.915
"Crisis," "explosion,"
"not rolling," "fired."

377
00:18:06.917 --> 00:18:08.652
These are just words.

378
00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:10.387
Yeah! Yeah!

379
00:18:10.389 --> 00:18:12.153
Keep a secret? A camera truck
in London

380
00:18:12.155 --> 00:18:13.487
just plowed into Judi Dench.

381
00:18:13.489 --> 00:18:14.951
Trust me, he's got
bigger problems.

382
00:18:14.953 --> 00:18:16.487
<i>Look, he may be able</i>
<i>to see me,</i>

383
00:18:16.489 --> 00:18:17.827
<i>but I can't see him.</i>

384
00:18:17.829 --> 00:18:19.362
Move. Move.

385
00:18:19.364 --> 00:18:22.229
- Hello, Les. Hello.
<i>- Get your ass out of my--</i>

386
00:18:22.231 --> 00:18:23.429
<i>Your feet were on my desk.</i>

387
00:18:23.431 --> 00:18:25.269
I don't know why we--

388
00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:27.534
Get him a Diet Coke.
Les. It's working.

389
00:18:27.536 --> 00:18:29.435
Whatever you're doing there.
Hello, Les.

390
00:18:29.437 --> 00:18:31.569
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Hello, Les.

391
00:18:31.571 --> 00:18:33.441
We got you loud
and clear here, Les.

392
00:18:33.443 --> 00:18:37.107
<i>I see you. I see you.</i>
<i>I see you.</i>

393
00:18:37.109 --> 00:18:41.214
<i>Which one of you fuckfaces</i>
<i>is Damien Cockburn?</i>

394
00:18:41.216 --> 00:18:42.715
Uh, that's me, sir.

395
00:18:42.717 --> 00:18:44.480
Uh, it's good to finally
meet you at last,

396
00:18:44.482 --> 00:18:46.683
get some face time.

397
00:18:46.685 --> 00:18:48.824
<i>And who here is the key grip?</i>

398
00:18:48.826 --> 00:18:51.591
<i>You? You.</i>

399
00:18:53.093 --> 00:18:56.629
<i>Hit that director in the face</i>
<i>really fucking hard.</i>

400
00:19:02.872 --> 00:19:04.373
Sorry, man.

401
00:19:06.579 --> 00:19:07.841
Ow. Ow.

402
00:19:07.843 --> 00:19:09.580
Ow.

403
00:19:09.582 --> 00:19:11.479
<i>Hm!</i>

404
00:19:11.481 --> 00:19:14.350
<i>This is your fault,</i>
<i>you limey fuck.</i>

405
00:19:14.352 --> 00:19:16.584
<i>You shit the money bed,</i>
<i>my friend.</i>

406
00:19:16.586 --> 00:19:19.786
Hey, Les, I understand
if you're angry,

407
00:19:19.788 --> 00:19:22.118
but I am dealing with a bunch
of prima donnas. Clowns.

408
00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.926
Tugg Speedman, he can't cry.

409
00:19:23.928 --> 00:19:25.361
He can't cry.

410
00:19:25.363 --> 00:19:26.590
<i>You know how you handle</i>
<i>an actor?</i>

411
00:19:26.592 --> 00:19:27.690
<i>They whine about anything,</i>

412
00:19:27.692 --> 00:19:29.263
<i>you pull down their pants</i>

413
00:19:29.265 --> 00:19:31.266
<i>and you spank their ass.</i>

414
00:19:31.268 --> 00:19:33.732
You spank that ass, Les.
What?

415
00:19:33.734 --> 00:19:36.202
Spanking a child turns him

416
00:19:36.204 --> 00:19:37.907
into a little snot.

417
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:41.577
Fear makes him a man.

418
00:19:41.579 --> 00:19:46.514
I know a place where
a man's worth is measured

419
00:19:46.516 --> 00:19:50.414
in the ears
hanging from his dog tags.

420
00:19:50.416 --> 00:19:53.420
The real deep shit.

421
00:19:53.422 --> 00:19:55.052
You wanna make
this movie right?

422
00:19:55.054 --> 00:20:00.363
That's where you take
your pansy-ass actors.

423
00:20:01.361 --> 00:20:02.629
<i>Who is this guy?</i>

424
00:20:02.631 --> 00:20:05.269
Uh, L-Les, that's, uh,
Four Leaf.

425
00:20:05.271 --> 00:20:07.233
Sergeant Four Leaf Tayback.

426
00:20:07.235 --> 00:20:08.870
I wrote the book.

427
00:20:08.872 --> 00:20:10.733
<i>Oh.</i>

428
00:20:10.735 --> 00:20:12.375
<i>You're a great American.</i>

429
00:20:12.377 --> 00:20:14.808
<i>This nation owes you</i>
<i>a huge debt.</i>

430
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.247
<i>Now shut the fuck up</i>
<i>and let me do my job!</i>

431
00:20:18.249 --> 00:20:19.983
<i>Look, Cockburn.</i>

432
00:20:19.985 --> 00:20:21.050
Yes?
<i>From now on,</i>

433
00:20:21.052 --> 00:20:22.118
<i>my fist is gonna be</i>

434
00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.815
<i>so far up your shithole...</i>

435
00:20:23.817 --> 00:20:25.621
<i>...that every time you have</i>

436
00:20:25.623 --> 00:20:27.155
<i>a thought,</i>
<i>it's gonna have to tiptoe</i>

437
00:20:27.157 --> 00:20:28.619
<i>past my wedding ring.</i>

438
00:20:28.621 --> 00:20:30.060
<i>Take control of your actors,</i>

439
00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:32.994
<i>or I will shut you down.</i>

440
00:20:32.996 --> 00:20:34.230
<i>Diet Coke!</i>

441
00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:48.809
When the herd loses its way,

442
00:20:48.811 --> 00:20:53.812
the shepherd must kill the bull
that leads them astray.

443
00:20:55.721 --> 00:20:56.782
Four Leaf?

444
00:20:56.784 --> 00:20:59.888
Come on over. It's okay.

445
00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:01.053
Sit down.

446
00:21:01.055 --> 00:21:02.688
Yes.

447
00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:06.325
So you, uh,
don't like the hotel?

448
00:21:06.327 --> 00:21:08.827
Beds give me nightmares.

449
00:21:13.536 --> 00:21:15.800
I'm guessing
right about now

450
00:21:15.802 --> 00:21:18.441
you couldn't find
a Dixie coonskin

451
00:21:18.443 --> 00:21:21.307
with an Ohio hooker
holding your prick

452
00:21:21.309 --> 00:21:24.282
and showing you the way.

453
00:21:30.085 --> 00:21:31.520
What?

454
00:21:31.522 --> 00:21:35.325
I put my story
in your limp Brit hands

455
00:21:35.327 --> 00:21:38.795
and you are not
going to fail me.

456
00:21:38.797 --> 00:21:42.398
You think I was just blowing
my own bagpipe in that meeting?

457
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.636
You must put those boys
in the shit.

458
00:21:46.638 --> 00:21:48.304
I don't understand.
I don't understand.

459
00:21:48.306 --> 00:21:49.740
You wanna make your movie
or not?

460
00:21:49.742 --> 00:21:51.642
Yes, I do.

461
00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:54.841
All right, you get some of those
little video-type cameras.

462
00:21:54.843 --> 00:21:57.980
We take them out there
and we put them in the trees

463
00:21:57.982 --> 00:21:58.975
in different angles.

464
00:21:58.977 --> 00:22:02.016
Then you give me
and that pyromaniac Cody

465
00:22:02.018 --> 00:22:06.783
all the smoke bombs, charges,
explosives, detonators you got.

466
00:22:06.785 --> 00:22:09.186
Then we take
those boys up there.

467
00:22:09.188 --> 00:22:12.861
Me and Cody, we could light up
that fucking jungle,

468
00:22:12.863 --> 00:22:16.233
so those lily-dick actors
would be shitting their pants

469
00:22:16.235 --> 00:22:18.130
and screaming
for their mammies.

470
00:22:18.132 --> 00:22:21.768
They'd be begging for a body bag
if it means a ride home.

471
00:22:24.569 --> 00:22:27.071
I could do it. I--

472
00:22:27.073 --> 00:22:29.139
I could shoot the whole thing
guerrilla style.

473
00:22:29.141 --> 00:22:31.341
Gritty, dirty. Get them away
from their helpers

474
00:22:31.343 --> 00:22:34.913
and ass-licking assistants.
Put them in the real shit.

475
00:22:34.915 --> 00:22:36.784
Real shit.
With real fear in their eyes.

476
00:22:36.786 --> 00:22:39.451
Real fear, real emotion.
Yes, Four Leaf, yes.

477
00:22:39.453 --> 00:22:41.050
Yes. Yes.
Yes.

478
00:22:41.052 --> 00:22:43.960
Yes.
Take them off the fucking grid.

479
00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:01.979
You are no longer

480
00:23:01.981 --> 00:23:04.544

481
00:23:04.546 --> 00:23:07.715

our position to Charlie?

515
00:24:37.338 --> 00:24:39.210
Cell phones.

516
00:24:39.212 --> 00:24:40.710
What the hell, Damien?

517
00:24:40.712 --> 00:24:42.004
Weren't no cell phones
in '69, man.

518
00:24:42.006 --> 00:24:44.044
I'm head-to-toe legitimate.

519
00:24:44.046 --> 00:24:47.845
Gentlemen, I've got good news
and bad news.

520
00:24:47.847 --> 00:24:49.680
The studio wants
to shut us down.

521
00:24:49.682 --> 00:24:51.286
That's the bad news.

522
00:24:51.288 --> 00:24:53.691
And the good news.

523
00:24:53.693 --> 00:24:56.894
If you want to save this movie,
you will become a unit.

524
00:24:56.896 --> 00:25:00.823
Your objective is to head north
to the D'ang Kwook River

525
00:25:00.825 --> 00:25:02.329
and liberate the POW camp,

526
00:25:02.331 --> 00:25:03.633
at which point

527
00:25:03.635 --> 00:25:05.633
Four Leaf will get himself
captured,

528
00:25:05.635 --> 00:25:07.637
at which point
you will rescue him,

529
00:25:07.639 --> 00:25:11.339
at which point
we will chopper you home!

530
00:25:11.341 --> 00:25:13.744
Oh!
Damn.

531
00:25:13.746 --> 00:25:15.338
Four Leaf, since you're
the staff sergeant,

532
00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.874
there's the map,
there's the scene list.

533
00:25:17.876 --> 00:25:20.112
Think you can handle it?

534
00:25:20.114 --> 00:25:23.120
We have rigged
this entire valley of death

535
00:25:23.122 --> 00:25:24.555
with hidden cameras.

536
00:25:25.556 --> 00:25:27.785
And I will be
shooting as well,

537
00:25:27.787 --> 00:25:29.792
from unseen vantage points,

538
00:25:29.794 --> 00:25:33.030
so that every glorious moment
is captured on film.

539
00:25:34.326 --> 00:25:37.294
And believe me, gentlemen,
it will be glorious.

540
00:25:37.296 --> 00:25:40.236
If it looks real,
chances are it probably is.

541
00:25:40.238 --> 00:25:41.937
You wanted to be actors.

542
00:25:41.939 --> 00:25:44.639
You wanted to occupy
the skin of another human being.

543
00:25:44.641 --> 00:25:45.970
Well, get ready
to occupy the skin

544
00:25:45.972 --> 00:25:47.536
of a terrified
U.S. Infantry grunt

545
00:25:47.538 --> 00:25:52.275
surrounded by death,
crawling up Satan's bottom.

546
00:25:52.277 --> 00:25:53.915
There'll be ambushes,
enemy fire,

547
00:25:53.917 --> 00:25:57.347
your own little
personal slice of 'Nam.

548
00:25:57.349 --> 00:26:01.917
This radio goes to the chopper
and the chopper only.

549
00:26:01.919 --> 00:26:03.691
The chopper is God,

550
00:26:03.693 --> 00:26:06.659
and I am Jesus Christ,
his son.

551
00:26:06.661 --> 00:26:09.393
You are my chosen disciples.

552
00:26:09.395 --> 00:26:12.534
And no one gets to go home
till we get the shots.

553
00:26:12.536 --> 00:26:15.103
Put on your war faces,
gentlemen.

554
00:26:15.105 --> 00:26:20.605
Now, let's go and make
the greatest war movie ever!

555
00:26:20.607 --> 00:26:22.144
Yeah!
Yeah!

556
00:26:22.146 --> 00:26:23.345
All right!

557
00:26:23.347 --> 00:26:24.978
Oh.

558
00:26:41.495 --> 00:26:43.062
Yeah!

559
00:26:44.465 --> 00:26:45.696
Whoo!

560
00:26:47.768 --> 00:26:49.033
Yeah!

561
00:27:01.715 --> 00:27:03.885
Not bad, Cockburn!

562
00:27:05.419 --> 00:27:06.987
Not bad.

563
00:27:08.458 --> 00:27:10.221
Wherever you are.

564
00:27:12.056 --> 00:27:13.664
Wherever he is?

565
00:27:13.666 --> 00:27:15.094
Looks like
he's all over the place.

566
00:27:16.762 --> 00:27:18.667
Here we go.

567
00:27:18.669 --> 00:27:20.462
Ah, must be an old
French mine.

568
00:27:20.464 --> 00:27:22.737
It's a remnant from
colonial Indo-China.

569
00:27:22.739 --> 00:27:25.073
This jungle must be
full of them.

570
00:27:25.075 --> 00:27:26.342
Hey.

571
00:27:26.344 --> 00:27:27.543
Don't you get it?

572
00:27:27.545 --> 00:27:30.044
He's messing with our heads.

573
00:27:30.046 --> 00:27:32.212
That's what all that
playing-God stuff was about.

574
00:27:32.214 --> 00:27:35.011
He's trying to get us
to act good, save the movie.

575
00:27:35.013 --> 00:27:36.585
He ain't playing God.

576
00:27:36.587 --> 00:27:38.819
He's being judged by him.

577
00:27:41.924 --> 00:27:43.557
That's our objective.

578
00:27:43.559 --> 00:27:44.893
Complete the mission.

579
00:27:50.796 --> 00:27:52.131
No offense, Kirk,

580
00:27:52.133 --> 00:27:53.804
I know you're
the big fancy actor here,

581
00:27:53.806 --> 00:27:55.736
but I've done a lot more
effects-driven

582
00:27:55.738 --> 00:27:57.736
event films than you, okay?

583
00:27:57.738 --> 00:27:59.303
And I think I can spot

584
00:28:01.512 --> 00:28:03.072
a prop head when I see one.

585
00:28:03.074 --> 00:28:04.814
Oh, Jesus.

586
00:28:05.615 --> 00:28:07.581
It's corn syrup, guys.

587
00:28:07.583 --> 00:28:09.313
Corn syrup and latex.

588
00:28:12.119 --> 00:28:15.688
Warm, blood-flavored
corn syrup.

589
00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:17.460
Oh, God.

590
00:28:17.462 --> 00:28:18.858
Smoke and mirrors, guys.

591
00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.660
Welcome to the movie factory.

592
00:28:20.662 --> 00:28:22.297
Oldest trick in the book.

593
00:28:22.299 --> 00:28:24.093
Wow! Ooh!

594
00:28:24.095 --> 00:28:25.564
Ooh, he getting down now.

595
00:28:25.566 --> 00:28:26.935
Oh, my God!

596
00:28:29.336 --> 00:28:31.301
Whoa, look at me! Oh!

597
00:28:31.303 --> 00:28:33.176
You're going to get
the shots

598
00:28:33.178 --> 00:28:36.208
and I'm going to make sure
because I'm the director.

599
00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:38.340
Oh, and I'm from London.
I direct plays.

600
00:28:38.342 --> 00:28:39.679
Hey, Damien!

601
00:28:39.681 --> 00:28:41.646
We got our war faces on!

602
00:28:51.828 --> 00:28:53.089
Hey, look,
I'm Dave Beckham.

603
00:28:53.091 --> 00:28:55.192
Whoo!

604
00:29:02.808 --> 00:29:05.468
So we gotta light
these boys up today, huh?

605
00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:09.244
Blow some sense
into these young men.

606
00:29:09.246 --> 00:29:11.648
Hey, I don't want to, uh,
come off as weird or anything,

607
00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:16.518
but I might be
your biggest fan. Yeah.

608
00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.250
<i>Tropic Thunder.</i>

609
00:29:18.252 --> 00:29:20.450
Kind of like my
<i>Catcher in the Rye.</i>

610
00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.926
Yeah, I've never been in
the military, per se,

611
00:29:23.928 --> 00:29:26.929
but I have lost an appendage
in the line of duty.

612
00:29:28.164 --> 00:29:30.728
<i>Driving Miss Daisy,</i>
first studio gig.

613
00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:32.496
Yeah.

614
00:29:32.498 --> 00:29:34.536
It's a pretty cool sidearm
you got there.

615
00:29:34.538 --> 00:29:35.839
What--? What is it?

616
00:29:35.841 --> 00:29:37.841
I don't know
what it's called.

617
00:29:38.875 --> 00:29:41.237
I just know
the sound it makes

618
00:29:41.239 --> 00:29:43.913
when it takes a man's life.

619
00:29:46.415 --> 00:29:47.543
Okay.

620
00:29:47.545 --> 00:29:49.350
Uh, Damien,
we're go for explosion.

621
00:29:49.352 --> 00:29:52.217
Ready to kick the tires and
light the fires on your say-so.

622
00:29:52.219 --> 00:29:54.251
Damien, we're go
for explosion.

623
00:29:54.253 --> 00:29:55.958
<i>Do you copy?</i>

624
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.423
<i>I got an itchy</i>
<i>trigger finger here</i>

625
00:29:57.425 --> 00:29:59.189

<i>to blow some shit up.</i>

626
00:29:59.191 --> 00:30:00.958
All right, you happy now? Huh?

627
00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.063
Can we do the scene?

628
00:30:03.065 --> 00:30:04.764
Or do you need
a formal invitation?

629
00:30:04.766 --> 00:30:06.863
Come on, let's go.

630
00:30:06.865 --> 00:30:08.599
Here. Okay.

631
00:30:08.601 --> 00:30:11.103
"Scene 12, exterior
jungle clearing. Day. Ambush...

"...Four Leaf notices

"A dozen guerrilla fighters can
be seen moving in the tree line.

634
00:30:21.413 --> 00:30:24.985
Somewhere a mine
explodes." And you.

635
00:30:24.987 --> 00:30:27.350
"I got a bad feeling
on this one."

636
00:30:27.352 --> 00:30:28.987
Yeah.
No, that's your line.

637
00:30:28.989 --> 00:30:30.552
Oh! I got-- Now?

638
00:30:30.554 --> 00:30:32.257
Yeah, but scared. Like, scared.

639
00:30:32.259 --> 00:30:33.793
"I got a bad feeling

640
00:30:33.795 --> 00:30:35.029
Dude, wait, like how?

641
00:30:35.031 --> 00:30:37.229
"I got a bad feeling
on this one."

642
00:30:37.231 --> 00:30:39.534
Yeah. Okay.
Action. Go, come on.

643
00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:49.479
I got a bad feeling

644
00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:51.211
on this one there, Fats.

645
00:30:52.612 --> 00:30:55.447
Our asses don't get fragged
in this bullshit valley,

646
00:30:55.449 --> 00:30:57.413
first thing I'm doing
is paying my 2 bucks

647
00:30:57.415 --> 00:30:59.189
so I can watch
Brooklyn bust his cherry

648
00:30:59.191 --> 00:31:01.884
on a sweet little mama-san's
dinky dau poontang.

649
00:31:01.886 --> 00:31:05.094
Shit, Brooklyn be bagged and
tagged before he get any cooch.

650
00:31:05.096 --> 00:31:07.528
He die, he probably die
a coochless motherfucker.

651
00:31:08.666 --> 00:31:10.195
Zip it, Motown.

652
00:31:10.197 --> 00:31:11.935
Man, I'm thirsty.

653
00:31:13.134 --> 00:31:15.201
Might as well
have some of this

654
00:31:15.203 --> 00:31:18.667
Booty Sweat
I got back in Da Nang.

655
00:31:18.669 --> 00:31:22.108
Yo, asshole!
This motherfucker's dead!

David Blaine trapdoor
horseshit jumping off here!

658
00:31:27.513 --> 00:31:29.512
Hey! You wanna get
on the train here,

659
00:31:29.514 --> 00:31:31.487
or do you wanna
ruin another take? Huh?

660
00:31:31.489 --> 00:31:35.490
There ain't no goddamn takes,
ain't no goddamn motion picture!

661
00:31:35.492 --> 00:31:36.890
You sure?

662
00:31:36.892 --> 00:31:38.088
Oh, yeah.
Yeah?

663
00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:39.424
For certain, man.

664
00:31:39.426 --> 00:31:43.066
Then why are you
still in character? Hm?

665
00:31:43.068 --> 00:31:45.364
I know, but I don't
have to tell you.

666
00:31:46.064 --> 00:31:47.198
You don't know.

667
00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.738
Man, I don't drop character

668
00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.606
till I done the DVD commentary.

669
00:31:51.705 --> 00:31:52.709
Ah!

670
00:31:52.711 --> 00:31:54.010
You happy now?

671
00:31:54.012 --> 00:31:55.612
We're out of position
for the effects!

672
00:31:55.614 --> 00:31:56.973
Get down, fool!

673
00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:00.714
Didn't anyone read the script?

674
00:32:00.716 --> 00:32:02.653
This is the ambush!

675
00:32:02.655 --> 00:32:04.853
Uh, this feels pretty real!

676
00:32:04.855 --> 00:32:06.983
Exactly. Let's use it.

677
00:32:16.731 --> 00:32:18.463
Oh, yeah!

678
00:32:20.372 --> 00:32:21.703
Oh, yeah!

679
00:32:23.939 --> 00:32:25.838
Eat lead!

680
00:32:27.106 --> 00:32:28.173
They're busting caps

681
00:32:28.175 --> 00:32:29.641
like a motherfucker down there.

682
00:32:29.643 --> 00:32:31.481
Oh!

683
00:32:32.682 --> 00:32:34.049
This is FUBAR.

684
00:32:34.051 --> 00:32:35.617
I say we juice them.
What do you think?

685
00:32:35.619 --> 00:32:36.987
Juice them.

686
00:32:38.955 --> 00:32:40.385
Fuck you, Charlie!

687
00:32:42.656 --> 00:32:43.658
Huh?

688
00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:45.193
Big-ass titties!

689
00:32:50.294 --> 00:32:52.899
Whoo. Look at that, huh?

690
00:32:57.738 --> 00:32:59.504
And cut!

691
00:33:01.013 --> 00:33:03.577
That's the trailer
right there.

692
00:33:03.579 --> 00:33:04.473
Yeah!

693
00:33:04.475 --> 00:33:05.910
What do we do now?

694
00:33:05.912 --> 00:33:07.015
Yeah.

695
00:33:07.017 --> 00:33:09.052
North. Man said
to head north.

696
00:33:09.054 --> 00:33:10.754
Did you see me shooting?
That's how we do.

697
00:33:10.756 --> 00:33:12.015
Good work, baby.

698
00:33:12.017 --> 00:33:13.183
I believed it.

699
00:33:13.185 --> 00:33:14.886
D'ang Kwook River.

700
00:33:14.888 --> 00:33:17.892
I'm betting he's got more
of these battles and Viet Congs

701
00:33:17.894 --> 00:33:19.225
rigged for us along the way.

702
00:33:19.227 --> 00:33:22.158
Sergeant Osiris,
get your men.

703
00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.231
Load and lock.

704
00:33:24.233 --> 00:33:26.333
Real, baby, I'm real.

705
00:33:26.335 --> 00:33:29.666
Let's go! We got
a lot of clicks to cover!

706
00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:33.742
Hump it up, gentlemen!
Single formation.

707
00:33:33.744 --> 00:33:35.838

on that hotplate?

717
00:34:06.777 --> 00:34:08.044
Something's up.

718
00:34:08.046 --> 00:34:09.777
I think we better
drag ass back there.

719
00:34:09.779 --> 00:34:13.116
Make sure Damien ain't forgot
how to use his talkbox again.

720
00:34:20.191 --> 00:34:24.623
Yeah, baby, come on.
Just a little taste.

721
00:34:24.625 --> 00:34:26.658
What are you doing, Jeff?
Fucking--! Nothing, man!

722
00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:28.263
It's jelly--
I'm eating jellybeans.

723
00:34:28.265 --> 00:34:30.728
Oh, wow, I love jellybeans.
Can I please--?

724
00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:32.899
No, you can't have
any fucking jellybeans!

725
00:34:32.901 --> 00:34:34.370
They're mine.

726
00:34:34.372 --> 00:34:36.073
You think you're the only one

have his jellybeans?

Hey. I didn't mean

736
00:35:00.326 --> 00:35:01.693
to show you up back there.

737
00:35:01.695 --> 00:35:03.793
It's just, I feel
like we really need

738
00:35:03.795 --> 00:35:05.834
to set the example
for the other guys.

739
00:35:05.836 --> 00:35:07.603
It's gonna be tough,

740
00:35:07.605 --> 00:35:11.405
but I think Damien's gonna get
some great shit out of us.

741
00:35:12.606 --> 00:35:14.477
Just wish I had a director
like this on<i> Jack.</i>

742
00:35:14.479 --> 00:35:18.113
On<i> Jack.</i> What?<i> Jack?</i>
What you talking about?

743
00:35:18.115 --> 00:35:20.715
<i>Simple Jack.</i>
Oh, yeah.

744
00:35:21.512 --> 00:35:22.745
<i>Simple Jack,</i> yeah.

745
00:35:22.747 --> 00:35:24.715
You went all out
on that one, huh?

746
00:35:24.717 --> 00:35:27.251
You did. Really swung
for the fences, huh?

747
00:35:27.253 --> 00:35:29.688
Thank you. Thanks. Yeah.

748
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:32.160
Yeah, it was an intense
experience, you know.

749
00:35:32.162 --> 00:35:35.461
I just--
I just did the work.

750
00:35:35.463 --> 00:35:37.661
Watched a lot of
retarded people.

751
00:35:37.663 --> 00:35:40.566
Spent time with them.
Observed them.

752
00:35:40.568 --> 00:35:42.767
Watched all the retarded stuff
they did.

753
00:35:42.769 --> 00:35:44.867
Then again, I always found
mere observation

754
00:35:44.869 --> 00:35:47.076
in and of itself
is a tad rudimentary.

755
00:35:47.078 --> 00:35:48.376
Sometimes,
we gotta dig deeper

756
00:35:48.378 --> 00:35:50.379
to mine the true
emotional pay dirt.

757
00:35:50.381 --> 00:35:52.741
Thus, we can diagram
the source of the pain

758
00:35:52.743 --> 00:35:54.809
and then live it,
you know.

759
00:35:54.811 --> 00:35:56.979
Yeah, yeah, live it.
Yeah, exactly.

760
00:35:56.981 --> 00:35:59.781
You know, there were times
when I was doing<i> Jack</i>

761
00:35:59.783 --> 00:36:02.488
that I actually
felt retarded,

762
00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:04.460
like really retarded.
Oh, yeah. Damn.

763
00:36:04.462 --> 00:36:07.858
In a weird way, I had to
sort of just free myself up

764
00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:11.032
to believe that it was okay
to be stupid or dumb.

765
00:36:11.034 --> 00:36:12.735
To be a moron.
Yeah.

766
00:36:12.737 --> 00:36:14.002
To be moronical.

767
00:36:14.004 --> 00:36:15.398
Exactly, to be a moron.

768
00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:16.834
An imbecile.
Yeah.

769
00:36:16.836 --> 00:36:19.340
Like the dumbest
motherfucker that ever lived.

770
00:36:19.342 --> 00:36:21.011
When I was
playing the character.

771
00:36:21.013 --> 00:36:22.141
When you was
the character.

772
00:36:22.143 --> 00:36:23.309
Yeah, as Jack, definitely.

773
00:36:23.311 --> 00:36:26.043
Yeah. Jack, stupid-ass Jack.

774
00:36:26.045 --> 00:36:28.983
By the end of the whole thing,
I was like, "Wait a minute,

775
00:36:28.985 --> 00:36:30.286
"I flushed so much out,

776
00:36:30.288 --> 00:36:32.516
how am I gonna
jumpstart it up again?"

777
00:36:32.518 --> 00:36:34.054
It's just like... pfft.

778
00:36:34.056 --> 00:36:35.156
Yeah.
Yeah, right?

779
00:36:35.158 --> 00:36:36.189
You was farting in bathtubs

780
00:36:36.191 --> 00:36:37.623
and laughing your ass off.

781
00:36:37.625 --> 00:36:39.157
Yeah. I mean,
it was really quite a--

782
00:36:39.159 --> 00:36:40.428
It was crazy.

783
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:42.024
It's like working
with mercury.

784
00:36:42.026 --> 00:36:43.900
It's high science, man.
It's an art form.

785
00:36:43.902 --> 00:36:45.894
Yeah.
You an artist.

786
00:36:45.896 --> 00:36:47.335
That's what we do, right?
Yeah.

787
00:36:47.337 --> 00:36:49.033
Yeah.
Hats off for going there,

788
00:36:49.035 --> 00:36:52.534
especially knowing how
the Academy is about that shit.

789
00:36:53.944 --> 00:36:56.774
Wait. About what?

790
00:36:57.975 --> 00:36:59.942
You're serious?
You don't know?

791
00:37:01.319 --> 00:37:04.287
Everybody knows
you never go full retard.

792
00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.118
What do you mean?

793
00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.254
Check it out.

794
00:37:07.256 --> 00:37:08.992
Dustin Hoffman,<i> Rain Man,</i>

795
00:37:08.994 --> 00:37:10.286
looked retarded, act retarded,

796
00:37:10.288 --> 00:37:11.490
not retarded.

797
00:37:11.492 --> 00:37:13.096
Count toothpicks,
cheat at cards.

798
00:37:13.098 --> 00:37:15.827
Autistic, sure.
Not retarded.

799
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:18.468
Then you got Tom Hanks,
<i>Forrest Gump.</i>

800
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:20.632
Slow, yes, retarded, maybe,
braces on his legs.

801
00:37:20.634 --> 00:37:22.171
But he charmed
the pants off Nixon

802
00:37:22.173 --> 00:37:23.500
and he won
a Ping-Pong competition.

803
00:37:23.502 --> 00:37:24.901
That ain't retarded.

804
00:37:26.144 --> 00:37:27.473
Peter Sellers,
<i>Being There.</i>

805
00:37:27.475 --> 00:37:29.939
Infantile, yes.
Retarded, no.

806
00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:32.942
You went full retard, man.

807
00:37:34.182 --> 00:37:36.348
Never go full retard.

808
00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:37.583
You don't buy that?

809
00:37:37.585 --> 00:37:40.221
Ask Sean Penn,
2001,<i> I Am Sam.</i>

810
00:37:40.223 --> 00:37:42.485
Remember?
Went full retard?

811
00:37:42.487 --> 00:37:43.986
Went home empty-handed.

812
00:37:53.235 --> 00:37:56.932
Oh, my God!
Holy shit!

813
00:37:56.934 --> 00:38:00.175
Good job, turd.
You killed the director.

814
00:38:00.177 --> 00:38:01.409
No, that's impossible, man.

815
00:38:01.411 --> 00:38:02.740
I mean, I rigged
the whole tree line

816
00:38:02.742 --> 00:38:04.312
and-- And this is here.
I mean,

817
00:38:04.314 --> 00:38:05.612
he must have
missed his mark.

818
00:38:05.614 --> 00:38:07.449
Missed his mark?
Yeah, this isn't me.

819
00:38:07.451 --> 00:38:09.017
Come on,
let's bag and tag the bastard

820
00:38:09.019 --> 00:38:10.320
and get back to the hotel.

821
00:38:10.322 --> 00:38:12.055
You're in a world
of hurt, dumbo!

822
00:38:12.057 --> 00:38:13.186
We're in a world of hurt!

823
00:38:13.188 --> 00:38:14.656
You're in trouble.

824
00:38:14.658 --> 00:38:16.325
This isn't just on me!
This-- We're in a--

825
00:38:16.327 --> 00:38:17.924
We're together on this.
Bullshit.

826
00:38:17.926 --> 00:38:19.824
You're just gonna run away?
You're gonna leave?

827
00:38:19.826 --> 00:38:21.460
What happened to,
"No man left behind"?

828
00:38:21.462 --> 00:38:22.794
Just wait, just wait! Listen!

829
00:38:22.796 --> 00:38:24.598
Listen, okay?
I don't wanna hear it.

830
00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.201
Let me just be real
with you, all right?

831
00:38:26.203 --> 00:38:27.696
I almost blinded
Jamie Lee Curtis

832
00:38:27.698 --> 00:38:29.634
on<i> Freaky Friday,</i> okay?

833
00:38:29.636 --> 00:38:31.066
This shit will
fucking ruin me.

834
00:38:31.068 --> 00:38:32.669
Oh, just get off me.
You're pathetic.

835
00:38:32.671 --> 00:38:33.735
No, I'm not.
Get off me.

836
00:38:33.737 --> 00:38:35.145
You are not going back--

837
00:38:38.949 --> 00:38:40.348
What the fuck?

838
00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:41.780
Now, wait a minute.

839
00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:00.700
I fucking hate movies.

840
00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:03.165
This is bullshit.

841
00:39:03.167 --> 00:39:05.067
I don't wanna be
in this shitty movie.

842
00:39:06.644 --> 00:39:10.206
<i>♪ You know</i>
<i>I smoked a lot of grass ♪</i>

843
00:39:10.208 --> 00:39:13.944

845

Kid, grab the bat!

846
00:39:20.892 --> 00:39:22.653
Please! Shit!

847
00:39:22.655 --> 00:39:23.852
Yo, man, I got
a Bust A Nut.

848
00:39:23.854 --> 00:39:26.495
You go to hell!
There he is.

849
00:39:29.629 --> 00:39:31.264
God-- Goddamn it!

850
00:39:31.266 --> 00:39:32.695
Where'd he go?

851
00:39:32.697 --> 00:39:34.097
You little piece of shit!

852
00:39:34.099 --> 00:39:36.538
I'm gonna fucking
rip your wings off!

853
00:39:37.801 --> 00:39:39.375
Sanducci.

854
00:39:39.377 --> 00:39:41.910
Hold up, man,
keep it on the down-low.

855
00:39:41.912 --> 00:39:44.807
I don't really gotta piss.
I'm trying to talk at you, man.

856
00:39:44.809 --> 00:39:46.614
Bait, I need bait.

857
00:39:47.582 --> 00:39:49.518
You went to
boot camp, right?

858
00:39:50.185 --> 00:39:51.185
You can read a map?

859
00:39:51.187 --> 00:39:52.688
Yeah, I think so.

860
00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:55.186
And I know Speedman got everyone
convinced we out here

861
00:39:55.188 --> 00:39:57.994
making<i> Planet of the Apes</i>
on YouTube or some shit,

862
00:39:57.996 --> 00:39:59.154
but I don't buy it.

863
00:39:59.156 --> 00:40:00.623
You wanna step on
a real land mine?

864
00:40:00.625 --> 00:40:02.498
You wanna die? Huh?

865
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.398
You wanna get shot
by a real motherfucker?

866
00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.628
No.
Keep looking ahead, man.

867
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:07.395
No, of course not.

868
00:40:07.397 --> 00:40:10.406
If I can put that map in your
hands, can I count you in?

869
00:40:10.408 --> 00:40:13.372
Uh-- Uh, well--
Uh, I guess you--

870
00:40:13.374 --> 00:40:15.137
Dynamite. I'm out.

871
00:40:17.144 --> 00:40:18.515
Ha!

872
00:40:18.517 --> 00:40:20.883
That smelled just like
bologna for some reason.

873
00:40:20.885 --> 00:40:23.947
Is anyone gonna fucking help me
get this fucking thing?

874
00:40:23.949 --> 00:40:25.884
Why are they even out
in the daytime?

875
00:40:28.692 --> 00:40:30.389
I'm gonna level with you, bro.

876
00:40:30.391 --> 00:40:32.325
I don't need to pee.

877
00:40:32.327 --> 00:40:33.760
I need to talk to you.

878
00:40:39.668 --> 00:40:43.737
Lazarus is gonna
torpedo the movie.

879
00:40:45.742 --> 00:40:47.642
He's way out on a limb
with this character

880
00:40:47.644 --> 00:40:50.106
and I think
he's getting cold feet.

881
00:40:51.116 --> 00:40:52.641
I need you on my side, Kyle.

882
00:40:52.643 --> 00:40:54.314
It's Kevin.

883
00:40:54.316 --> 00:40:57.179
Good. Can I count on you?

884
00:40:57.181 --> 00:41:01.819
If you want I could, uh,
give the map a look-see.

885
00:41:01.821 --> 00:41:03.386
I'll handle the map.
Okay.

886
00:41:03.388 --> 00:41:06.662
You stick with the program,
we get this movie in the can,

887
00:41:06.664 --> 00:41:08.590
I'm thinking there could be
a Teen Choice Award

888
00:41:08.592 --> 00:41:09.928
in it for you.

889
00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:12.700
You have that potential.

890
00:41:12.702 --> 00:41:15.336
They'll slime you,
the whole deal.

891
00:41:15.338 --> 00:41:17.668
Yeah, that's wicked.

892
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:19.003
Good.

893
00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:27.411
There it is!
Yeah, now you're dead!

894
00:41:28.415 --> 00:41:30.746
You O.D.'d!

895
00:41:30.748 --> 00:41:32.516
Hold up now.

896
00:41:34.718 --> 00:41:37.725
Fucking hell!

897
00:41:37.727 --> 00:41:40.727
What the hell, Jeff?
That's a bat, man.

898
00:41:40.729 --> 00:41:43.929
I don't have any more
jellybeans.

899
00:41:50.074 --> 00:41:52.201
You land there!

900
00:42:06.689 --> 00:42:10.054
Wow. Look at these ruins.

901
00:42:11.294 --> 00:42:13.759
Where the hell are we?

902
00:42:13.761 --> 00:42:15.525
D'ang Kwook River.

903
00:42:15.527 --> 00:42:17.865
- That so? How do you know that?
- How you sure?

904
00:42:17.867 --> 00:42:21.131
Only one way to find out,
dude. Let's go.

905
00:42:21.133 --> 00:42:23.735
Yeah. I'm not feeling
so good right now.

906
00:42:23.737 --> 00:42:25.706
Seriously,
my skin hurts.

907
00:42:25.708 --> 00:42:27.137
Enough from
the peanut gallery.

908
00:42:27.139 --> 00:42:28.942
Into the water, ladies.
No, no, no, man.

909
00:42:28.944 --> 00:42:30.613
Let me take a look at that map
right quick.

910
00:42:30.615 --> 00:42:32.311
Why is everybody
all obsessed with the map?

911
00:42:32.313 --> 00:42:34.616
'Cause we're tired
of being your trail donkeys.

912
00:42:34.618 --> 00:42:36.852
Acting like you
some one-man GPS.

913
00:42:36.854 --> 00:42:40.789
Goddamn it! We lost!
We fucking super lost, man!

914
00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:43.021
Tell him, McClusky.
Tell him what time it is.

915
00:42:43.023 --> 00:42:45.188
- I don't believe you people.
- Huh?

916
00:42:46.256 --> 00:42:48.928
What do you mean,
"you people"?

917
00:42:50.766 --> 00:42:52.667
What do you mean,
"you people"?

918
00:42:52.669 --> 00:42:55.637
Huh?
I think what Tugg means is...

919
00:42:55.639 --> 00:42:57.298
No, look at his eyes, man.

920
00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.301
Look at them beady,
white devil eyes.

921
00:42:59.303 --> 00:43:01.109
I gotta get back
to the hotel, for real!

922
00:43:01.111 --> 00:43:02.310
Oh, hell, no!

923
00:43:04.714 --> 00:43:07.177
Chill, all right?
Just chill it.

924
00:43:08.652 --> 00:43:12.751
Now, let's go get
those Viet Congs.

925
00:43:12.753 --> 00:43:14.322
"Viet Cong."
What?

926
00:43:14.324 --> 00:43:15.658
It's "Viet Cong."

927
00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:17.790
There's no S.
It's already plural.

928
00:43:17.792 --> 00:43:20.091
You wouldn't say
"Chineses."

929
00:43:21.492 --> 00:43:23.699
All right, that's enough
of this insubordination.

930
00:43:23.701 --> 00:43:26.095
If the machine breaks down,
we break down.

931
00:43:26.097 --> 00:43:27.562
Hey, man,
you know how in<i> Rambo I,</i>

932
00:43:27.564 --> 00:43:29.636
he was big but a little puffy,
and then<i> Rambo II,</i>

933
00:43:29.638 --> 00:43:31.037
he got all shredded up?
Yeah.

934
00:43:31.039 --> 00:43:32.567
That's kind of how
you look right now.

935
00:43:32.569 --> 00:43:34.741
Oh. Yeah?
You know, not<i> Rambo I</i> but<i> II.</i>

936
00:43:34.743 --> 00:43:36.475
Really?
Yeah, when he was cut up.

937
00:43:36.477 --> 00:43:38.745
Well, I'm not that-- I mean,
that's what I'm going for,

938
00:43:38.747 --> 00:43:40.145
but you know--
Come on, dude.

939
00:43:40.147 --> 00:43:42.177
You more shredded than
a julienne salad, man.

940
00:43:42.179 --> 00:43:43.685
Thanks.
What's the secret, dude?

941
00:43:43.687 --> 00:43:45.184
It's a diet.
I'm just dieting.

942
00:43:45.186 --> 00:43:47.050
Really? Because I'm trying
to come up a little,

943
00:43:47.052 --> 00:43:48.556
but it's just-- It's tough.

944
00:43:48.558 --> 00:43:50.085
You look good.
Any tips?

945
00:43:50.087 --> 00:43:51.560
What?
Any tips, you got?

946
00:43:51.562 --> 00:43:52.792
There's, like,
the pineapple--

947
00:43:52.794 --> 00:43:54.525
Give me that goddamn map!
Hey!

948
00:43:54.527 --> 00:43:55.694
Fuck you!

949
00:43:55.696 --> 00:43:57.360
Hey!
All right, now!

950
00:43:57.362 --> 00:43:59.968
What it is, Sikorski?
Tell us where we really at.

951
00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.803
That's fucking bullshit!
It's a chump move.

952
00:44:01.805 --> 00:44:03.468
We just getting
a second opinion, doc.

953
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:04.806
Uh...

954
00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:07.003
we're going the wrong way.

955
00:44:07.005 --> 00:44:08.471
Damn!
Son of a bitch.

956
00:44:08.473 --> 00:44:11.813
God-- I think we were
supposed to be doing this,

957
00:44:12.646 --> 00:44:15.882
and instead we did this.

958
00:44:15.884 --> 00:44:19.988
Shit, shit,
shit, shitty shit, shit!

959
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:21.955
Think you can get us back
to the drop zone, boy?

960
00:44:22.889 --> 00:44:24.958
This is not cool!

961
00:44:27.131 --> 00:44:28.258
Maybe.

962
00:44:29.629 --> 00:44:31.393
This is insane.

963
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:35.670
Are you really gonna
abandon this movie?

964
00:44:35.672 --> 00:44:38.140
We're supposed to be a unit.

965
00:44:38.142 --> 00:44:39.973
Suck my unit.

966
00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.137
All right, fine.

967
00:44:42.139 --> 00:44:44.547
I'll finish it by myself.

968
00:44:44.549 --> 00:44:46.981
You go be all
you can be, man.

969
00:44:46.983 --> 00:44:49.547
Tugg, you have no idea
where you're going.

970
00:44:49.549 --> 00:44:51.150
Yes, I do.

971
00:44:51.152 --> 00:44:55.853
I'm going to, "Exterior.
Rain forest. Dusk.

972
00:44:55.855 --> 00:44:57.387
"Smash cut to Four Leaf,

973
00:44:57.389 --> 00:45:00.362
who treks alone through
a frightening jungle."

974
00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:02.660
Suck on that unit, Kirk.

You're beautiful.

989
00:46:02.492 --> 00:46:04.126
Ooh!

990
00:46:04.128 --> 00:46:06.125
Now, if you recall
that whole hullabaloo,

991
00:46:06.127 --> 00:46:07.895
uh, where Hollywood
was split into schisms,

992
00:46:07.897 --> 00:46:09.629
some studios backing
Blu-ray disc,

993
00:46:09.631 --> 00:46:11.196
others backing HD DVD.

994
00:46:11.198 --> 00:46:13.069
People thought it would
come down to pixel rate

995
00:46:13.071 --> 00:46:14.796
or refresh rate, and they're
pretty much the same.

996
00:46:14.798 --> 00:46:19.004
What it came down to was a
combination of gamers and porn.

997
00:46:19.006 --> 00:46:20.670
Now, whichever format
porno backs

998
00:46:20.672 --> 00:46:24.446
is usually the one that becomes
the, uh, most successful.

999
00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:25.881
Uh, but, you know, Sony,

1000
00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:27.881
every PlayStation 3
has a Blu-ray in it.

1001
00:46:27.883 --> 00:46:29.852
You talking to me
this whole time?

1002
00:46:29.854 --> 00:46:31.748
I-- I was talking to whoever
was listening to me.

1003
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:33.185

Oh, God.

1009
00:47:03.485 --> 00:47:08.020
It's cold. Ooh, it's freezing.
I'm fucking cold.

1010
00:47:08.022 --> 00:47:09.892
You want my flak jacket?

1011
00:47:09.894 --> 00:47:12.190
What, are you insane?
It's boiling.

1012
00:47:12.192 --> 00:47:13.889
It's like a sweat lodge
out here.

1013
00:47:13.891 --> 00:47:17.096
Keep the volume down on
that bitching, Flatch Adams.

1014
00:47:17.098 --> 00:47:19.330
Ah, I gotta take
a fucking 12-pound shit.

1015
00:47:19.332 --> 00:47:20.901
How we doing? Making good time?

1016
00:47:20.903 --> 00:47:22.100
We're making good time,

1017
00:47:22.102 --> 00:47:23.232
but there's no way we make it

1018
00:47:23.234 --> 00:47:25.107
over that ridge before sundown.

1019
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:27.338
All right, fellas,
we're gonna make camp. Rest up.

1020
00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:29.637
Oh, God.
Y'all might be in for a treat.

1021
00:47:29.639 --> 00:47:31.307
You know, back before
the war broked out,

1022
00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:33.642
I was a saucier
in San Antone.

1023
00:47:33.644 --> 00:47:36.481
I bet I could collar up
some of them greens.

1024
00:47:36.483 --> 00:47:41.190
Yeah, noodle some crawfish
out the paddy, yo. Ha!

1025
00:47:41.192 --> 00:47:44.118
And maybe some crab apples
for dessert, now, you hear?

1026
00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:46.257
Hell, yeah! Ha!

1027
00:47:46.259 --> 00:47:47.827
Hell, yeah! Ha!

1028
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:49.228
That's how we all talk.

1029
00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:52.265
We all talk like this, suh!
Yes, suh. Ha!

1030
00:47:52.267 --> 00:47:56.205
Yeah, mm-hm, get some crawfish
and some ribs. Ha!

1031
00:47:56.207 --> 00:47:57.268
Yeah.

1032
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:58.901
You're Australian.

1033
00:47:58.903 --> 00:48:00.742
Be Australian.

1034
00:48:00.744 --> 00:48:02.945
Excuse me,
Kangaroo Jack.

1035
00:48:06.542 --> 00:48:09.482
I get excited
about my foods, man.

1036
00:49:34.734 --> 00:49:37.171
Die!

1037
00:49:51.014 --> 00:49:53.220
No!

1038
00:49:59.493 --> 00:50:01.489
Dude, dude, what the hell
is going on here?

1039
00:50:01.491 --> 00:50:03.697
Where are we?

1040
00:50:03.699 --> 00:50:06.101
I have no idea.

1041
00:50:06.103 --> 00:50:08.768
I've never been
outside the States.

1042
00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:09.970
Wait, what?

1043
00:50:09.972 --> 00:50:11.469
Are you fucking
kidding me?

1044
00:50:11.471 --> 00:50:13.439
Did you make this
whole goddamn thing up?

1045
00:50:13.441 --> 00:50:15.207
Dude, were you even
in the fucking service?

1046
00:50:15.209 --> 00:50:17.946
Yes. Of course.
Coast Guard.

1047
00:50:17.948 --> 00:50:19.976
Coast Guard.
Sanitation Department.

1048
00:50:19.978 --> 00:50:21.180
Oh, my God!

1049
00:50:21.182 --> 00:50:22.578
You're a fucking
garbage man!

1050
00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:24.580
Damn it.
F.L. Tayback lies to me

1051
00:50:24.582 --> 00:50:26.486
and the whole
goddamn U.S. of A.

1052
00:50:26.488 --> 00:50:29.554
I wrote the book as a tribute.
I'm a patriot.

1053
00:50:29.556 --> 00:50:31.390
Yeah, you're the Milli Vanilli
of patriots.

1054
00:50:31.392 --> 00:50:33.088
You lied about fighting
the Vietnam War.

1055
00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:36.494
It's like punching the American
flag in the face, goddamn it.

1056
00:50:36.496 --> 00:50:38.331
God, and to think
I believed in you.

1057
00:50:38.333 --> 00:50:39.962
Writers lie all the time.

1058
00:50:39.964 --> 00:50:43.267
Can I be tied to another post?

1059
00:50:58.983 --> 00:51:01.552
Oh. Ah.

1060
00:51:03.021 --> 00:51:04.324
Yeah!

1061
00:51:04.326 --> 00:51:06.057
<i> Rick?</i>
Tugg.

1062
00:51:06.059 --> 00:51:07.822
I killed one, Rick.

1063
00:51:09.364 --> 00:51:11.331
The thing I love most
in the world.

1064
00:51:12.265 --> 00:51:13.795
Vivica, get off the line now.

1065
00:51:15.601 --> 00:51:18.306
A hooker. All right,
you killed a hooker.

1066
00:51:18.308 --> 00:51:20.602
Calm down. Here's what
you're gonna do.

1067
00:51:20.604 --> 00:51:22.177
Get your hands
on some bleach,

1068
00:51:22.179 --> 00:51:24.305
some hydrogen peroxide
and a shitload of lime.

1069
00:51:24.307 --> 00:51:25.978
No, a panda.

1070
00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:28.015
<i>I killed a panda.</i>

1071
00:51:28.017 --> 00:51:29.782
Amanda?
Come on, dude.

1072
00:51:29.784 --> 00:51:32.082
I mean, that-- That's probably
not even her real name.

1073
00:51:32.084 --> 00:51:33.621
No, a panda.

1074
00:51:33.623 --> 00:51:34.986
A panda?

1075
00:51:34.988 --> 00:51:37.892
A sweet, cuddly,

1076
00:51:37.894 --> 00:51:39.794
<i>vicious little panda.</i>

1077
00:51:39.796 --> 00:51:41.228
Jesus Christ, Tugg.

1078
00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:43.194
Man, don't scare me
like that.

1079
00:51:43.196 --> 00:51:44.394
It's beautiful here.

1080
00:51:44.396 --> 00:51:45.964
<i>You on-- You on the set?</i>

1081
00:51:45.966 --> 00:51:47.297
I am the set.

1082
00:51:47.299 --> 00:51:48.762
<i>All right, man. Hey,</i>

1083
00:51:48.764 --> 00:51:50.572
how's the TiVo
working out?

1084
00:51:50.574 --> 00:51:51.599
Screw TiVo.

1085
00:51:51.601 --> 00:51:53.268
<i>I'm way beyond TiVo.</i>

1086
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:54.803
Last I checked,

1087
00:51:54.805 --> 00:51:56.275
they hadn't
hooked it up, though.

1088
00:51:56.277 --> 00:51:59.178
Hadn't hooked it up?
No TiVo?

1089
00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:02.316
It doesn't matter anymore.

1090
00:52:04.315 --> 00:52:06.922
I've moved on.

1091
00:52:06.924 --> 00:52:08.756
Where have you
moved on to?

1092
00:52:08.758 --> 00:52:10.220
<i>Another agency?</i>

1093
00:52:11.454 --> 00:52:12.822
Hey, who is with you?

1094
00:52:12.824 --> 00:52:15.357
<i>You are still my client,</i>
<i>Tugg Speedman.</i>

1095
00:52:15.359 --> 00:52:17.232
<i>I am getting the TiVo.</i>

1096
00:52:17.234 --> 00:52:18.798
Jacket's on,
I'm out the door.

1097
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.400
<i>Tugg?</i>

1098
00:52:23.401 --> 00:52:25.366
Please don't fire me.

1099
00:52:27.877 --> 00:52:30.342
Oh, mama. Thirsty.

1100
00:52:30.344 --> 00:52:32.907
He doesn't look
too good.

1101
00:52:32.909 --> 00:52:37.714
Must drink so I can throw
something up.

1102
00:52:37.716 --> 00:52:39.219
No, don't drink that water!

1103
00:52:39.221 --> 00:52:40.719
That water's like a petri dish!

1104
00:52:40.721 --> 00:52:42.954
No, don't! Uh, Alpa, do you
have any Booty Sweat?

1105
00:52:44.428 --> 00:52:46.593
Yeah, get him chugging on
some of Alpa's ass water.

1106
00:52:46.595 --> 00:52:48.660
That'll bring him around.
It's a cure-all.

1107
00:52:48.662 --> 00:52:50.627
Man, what you coming out
in movies for anyway?

1108
00:52:50.629 --> 00:52:52.432
Did you need
another revenue stream?

1109
00:52:52.434 --> 00:52:54.896
For your information,
my revenue stream

1110
00:52:54.898 --> 00:52:57.867
currently generates
$2 million a year

1111
00:52:57.869 --> 00:52:59.971
in charitable contributions
for my community.

1112
00:52:59.973 --> 00:53:01.175
Hot damn.

1113
00:53:01.177 --> 00:53:02.474
And why am I
in this movie?

1114
00:53:02.476 --> 00:53:04.644
Maybe I just knew
I had to represent,

1115
00:53:04.646 --> 00:53:06.709
because they had one good part
in it for a black man

1116
00:53:06.711 --> 00:53:09.284
and they gave it
to Crocodile Dundee.

1117
00:53:10.282 --> 00:53:11.547
Pump your brakes, kid.

1118
00:53:11.549 --> 00:53:13.818
That man is a national treasure.

1119
00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:16.422
I just wanted to throw another
shrimp on your barbie.

1120
00:53:16.424 --> 00:53:18.327
That shit ain't funny.
Hey, fellas.

1121
00:53:18.329 --> 00:53:19.822
It's hot, we're tired,
it stinks.

1122
00:53:19.824 --> 00:53:21.956
I'm just fucking with you,
Kangaroo Jack.

1123
00:53:21.958 --> 00:53:23.762
I'm sorry a dingo
ate your baby.

1124
00:53:23.764 --> 00:53:26.365
You know that's a true story?
Lady lost her kid.

1125
00:53:26.367 --> 00:53:28.100
You about to cross
some fucking lines.

1126
00:53:28.102 --> 00:53:29.302
Guys, relax.

1127
00:53:29.304 --> 00:53:30.802
You know what?
Fuck that, man.

1128
00:53:30.804 --> 00:53:33.539
I'm sick of this koala-hugging
nigger telling me--

1129
00:53:37.781 --> 00:53:40.280
For 400 years,

1130
00:53:40.282 --> 00:53:43.681
that word
has kept us down.

1131
00:53:44.315 --> 00:53:45.917
What the fuck?

1132
00:53:45.919 --> 00:53:49.718
It took a whole lot of trying
just to get up that hill.

1133
00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:52.927
Now we up
in the big leagues,

1134
00:53:52.929 --> 00:53:54.626
getting our turn at bat.

1135
00:53:54.628 --> 00:53:56.760
Long as we live,
it's you and me, baby.

1136
00:53:58.061 --> 00:54:00.165
That's the theme song
for<i> The Jeffersons.</i>

1137
00:54:00.167 --> 00:54:01.801
You really need help.

1138
00:54:01.803 --> 00:54:04.638
Just because it's the theme song
don't make it not true.

1139
00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:06.668
You know what? I'm gonna
tell you what's true.

1140
00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:08.506
I'm gonna tag you back.

1141
00:54:08.508 --> 00:54:10.307
You better
believe that, baby.

1142
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:11.746
Guys.

1143
00:54:11.748 --> 00:54:13.808
Hey, guys.

1144
00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:15.977
Jeff, stay away
from that animal.

1145
00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:22.016
I'm gonna bite his hide.
I need...

1146
00:54:22.018 --> 00:54:26.220
I need to wear his stomach skin
like a unitard.

1147
00:54:26.222 --> 00:54:29.590
Ain't nobody doing nothing
to no one or body!

1148
00:54:29.592 --> 00:54:31.830
Now, Mr. Portnoy,

1149
00:54:31.832 --> 00:54:34.731
feeling a little flu-ish,
don't wanna walk,

1150
00:54:34.733 --> 00:54:37.133
put him up on that
cloven-hoof animal!

1151
00:54:38.503 --> 00:54:40.340
We got ground to cover.

1152
00:55:08.502 --> 00:55:12.633
All right,
POW camp, scene 67.

1153
00:55:12.635 --> 00:55:15.069
Bring it on, Cockburn!

1154
00:55:21.683 --> 00:55:25.816
My body may be shackled,
but my mind wanders free.

1155
00:55:26.416 --> 00:55:28.791
Ah! Oh!

1156
00:55:30.155 --> 00:55:32.692
Wait, let me do the line again.
Let me do the line again.

1157
00:55:32.694 --> 00:55:36.864
My body may be shackled,
but my mind wanders free.

1158
00:55:39.233 --> 00:55:41.134
Ah!

1159
00:55:44.006 --> 00:55:45.303
Good, again. Again.

1160
00:55:50.945 --> 00:55:53.879
Good, good. Now let's do
the torture scene.

1161
00:55:53.881 --> 00:55:55.984
I see moss on
both sides of that tree.

1162
00:55:55.986 --> 00:55:59.048
You know, maybe if I wasn't
the only one at boot camp...

1163
00:55:59.050 --> 00:56:00.786
My belly really hurts,
you guys.

1164
00:56:00.788 --> 00:56:03.121
I'm not joking around.
I'm nauseous.

1165
00:56:03.123 --> 00:56:05.488
Let me off, I gotta puke.
I don't wanna die like Hendrix.

1166
00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:07.759
All right. All right.

1167
00:56:12.199 --> 00:56:13.968
Are you okay, Jeff?

1168
00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:15.437
I'm awesome.

1169
00:56:17.775 --> 00:56:19.340
Holy shit!

1170
00:56:23.578 --> 00:56:25.579
Oh. Okay. Shh. Everyone,
down, down, down.

1171
00:56:30.484 --> 00:56:31.982
Man.
Now I'm tripping.

1172
00:56:31.984 --> 00:56:35.587
That looks like the POW camp
from out the script, yo.

1173
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:37.223
Speedman was right?

1174
00:56:37.225 --> 00:56:38.791
I don't think so.

1175
00:56:38.793 --> 00:56:41.122
Look at the cooking vats,
the armed guards.

1176
00:56:42.993 --> 00:56:45.498
Looks like a heroin
processing plant.

1177
00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:47.098
We were in that chopper
for hours.

1178
00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:49.433
I-- I don't even think
we're in Vietnam anymore.

1179
00:56:49.435 --> 00:56:50.733
Fuck.
Shit.

1180
00:56:50.735 --> 00:56:51.934
We ain't even in 'Nam?

1181
00:56:51.936 --> 00:56:54.804
No, most likely
Myanmar or Lao.

1182
00:56:54.806 --> 00:56:56.640
What the fuck is Lao?

1183
00:56:56.642 --> 00:56:58.106
It's the Golden Triangle.

1184
00:56:58.108 --> 00:56:59.941
The world's hard-drug
superhighway.

1185
00:56:59.943 --> 00:57:01.348
And how do you
know about that?

1186
00:57:01.350 --> 00:57:02.548
It was a really
long trip.

1187
00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:04.915
I read the
in-flight magazine.

1188
00:57:06.152 --> 00:57:07.716
Cut!

1189
00:57:07.718 --> 00:57:09.018
Oh, Jesus.

1190
00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:10.992
What do you see, man?
I'm blocked.

1191
00:57:10.994 --> 00:57:13.055
Damien, cut!

1192
00:57:14.724 --> 00:57:16.999
Hey, Damien, cut!

1193
00:57:17.001 --> 00:57:19.465
They got Speedman.

1194
00:57:19.467 --> 00:57:21.536
And it doesn't look good.

1195
00:57:53.629 --> 00:57:55.768
I am Tran.

1196
00:57:55.770 --> 00:57:58.166
You are a trespasser
in my poppy fields.

1197
00:57:59.636 --> 00:58:02.610
You are DEA scum.

1198
00:58:03.877 --> 00:58:08.110
Were there some re-writes
that I missed?

1199
00:58:11.316 --> 00:58:12.653
Oh!

1200
00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:16.223
Do you want to die?

1201
00:58:16.225 --> 00:58:17.454
Do you?
No!

1202
00:58:17.456 --> 00:58:19.524
P-P-Please,

1203
00:58:19.526 --> 00:58:21.827
d-don't h-hurt m-me!

1204
00:58:29.501 --> 00:58:30.766
Say that again.

1205
00:58:30.768 --> 00:58:33.639
Please, don't hurt me.

1206
00:58:33.641 --> 00:58:37.145
No! Like you did before!
Say it!

1207
00:58:37.147 --> 00:58:38.909
Wha--?
Say it!

1208
00:58:38.911 --> 00:58:42.947
P-P-Please,
d-d-d-don't h-hurt me!

1209
00:58:58.468 --> 00:59:01.735
What?
You are Simple Jack.

1210
00:59:03.933 --> 00:59:05.904
You saw<i> Simple Jack?</i>

1211
00:59:05.906 --> 00:59:08.109
We love the tale of
this man, Simple Jack.

1212
00:59:10.514 --> 00:59:12.078
We do not have
many luxury here.

1213
00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:14.578
And<i> Simple Jack</i>
is the only movie we possess.

1214
00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:17.018
Oh. You got the...

1215
00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:18.312
It's VHS.

1216
00:59:18.314 --> 00:59:20.717
We've watched it many,
many times.

1217
00:59:20.719 --> 00:59:23.284
You should've got Oscar.

1218
00:59:25.593 --> 00:59:29.231
Oh, well, you know. It's...

1219
00:59:29.233 --> 00:59:30.565
Just to be nominated...

1220
00:59:30.567 --> 00:59:32.366
You were nominated?
No, no, no.

1221
00:59:32.368 --> 00:59:33.801
I wasn't nominated.

1222
00:59:33.803 --> 00:59:35.362
I'm just saying that
to have been nominated

1223
00:59:35.364 --> 00:59:37.432
would have been nice.
It's just...

1224
00:59:37.434 --> 00:59:39.670
It's very political.
You have to take out ads...

1225
00:59:39.672 --> 00:59:42.006
Shut up now!
Okay. Okay.

1226
00:59:42.971 --> 00:59:45.873
So are you going to...

1227
00:59:45.875 --> 00:59:47.649
let me go, or...?

1228
00:59:47.651 --> 00:59:49.843
No. We'll hold you
for ransom.

1229
00:59:49.845 --> 00:59:51.785
Much more money now.

1230
01:00:02.958 --> 01:00:04.865
He's in a meeting.

1231
01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:08.033
Yeah, I know. In about
two seconds with the Pecker.

1232
01:00:08.035 --> 01:00:10.068
I'm gonna rip
your fucking tits off.

1233
01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:11.965
You wanna talk about trouble?
That's trouble.

1234
01:00:11.967 --> 01:00:14.676
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1235
01:00:16.444 --> 01:00:18.306
What do you need, Peck?

1236
01:00:18.308 --> 01:00:21.247
No, more like what
do you need, Les?

1237
01:00:21.249 --> 01:00:23.282
Glasses?

1238
01:00:23.284 --> 01:00:24.647
What?

1239
01:00:24.649 --> 01:00:25.751
So you can read

1240
01:00:25.753 --> 01:00:27.084
the<i> Tropic Thunder</i> contract

1241
01:00:27.086 --> 01:00:30.023
that guarantees my client,
Tugg Speedman,

1242
01:00:30.025 --> 01:00:34.091
some form of digital-video
recorder on location.

1243
01:00:34.093 --> 01:00:35.895
Huh?
I can't believe
you let him in.

1244
01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:39.628
Look, fuckstick,
I'm incredibly busy.

1245
01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:41.869
Why don't you get out of here
before I snap your dick off

1246
01:00:41.871 --> 01:00:45.072
and jam it into your ass?
No, not you, Helen.

1247
01:00:45.074 --> 01:00:47.167
<i>♪ Sometimes when we touch ♪</i>

1248
01:00:47.169 --> 01:00:48.643
But I will rip your tits off

1249
01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.144
if you don't get me
those theaters.

1250
01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:51.506
Perfect.

1251
01:00:51.508 --> 01:00:54.078
Hey, Tuggernuts, I've got you
on speakerphone.

1252
01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.247
I'm standing here
with Les Grossman

1253
01:00:56.249 --> 01:00:58.580
and he is dying to tell you
why he's apparently

1254
01:00:58.582 --> 01:01:01.855
wiped his ass with the TiVo
clause from your contract.

1255
01:01:03.051 --> 01:01:04.821
We are Flaming Dragon.

1256
01:01:04.823 --> 01:01:07.223
Speedman is with us now.

1257
01:01:07.225 --> 01:01:11.293
<i>For 50 million,</i>
<i>you will get him back.</i>

1258
01:01:11.295 --> 01:01:13.129
Are you gonna get those...?
Who is this?

1259
01:01:13.131 --> 01:01:14.797
And how did you
get this phone?

1260
01:01:14.799 --> 01:01:16.064
<i>We are Flaming Dragon.</i>

1261
01:01:16.066 --> 01:01:18.272
Simple Jack belong to us now.

1262
01:01:18.274 --> 01:01:21.001
I can't believe I'm still
having this conversation.

1263
01:01:21.003 --> 01:01:23.041
Oh, he does, does he?

1264
01:01:23.043 --> 01:01:25.274
Hey, let me tell you
something, shitbird.

1265
01:01:25.276 --> 01:01:28.279
I've never even heard
of your little agency.

1266
01:01:28.281 --> 01:01:30.249
<i>But if you think</i>
<i>you can poach my client--</i>

1267
01:01:30.251 --> 01:01:32.915
<i>Send $50 million, or you no see</i>
<i>Simple Jack again</i>

1268
01:01:32.917 --> 01:01:34.853
<i>because we kill him.</i>

1269
01:01:34.855 --> 01:01:36.655
This is Les Grossman.
Who is this?

1270
01:01:36.657 --> 01:01:38.892
This is Flaming Dragon!

1271
01:01:38.894 --> 01:01:41.422
Oh, okay. Flaming Dragon.
Fuckface.

1272
01:01:41.424 --> 01:01:45.266
First, take a big step back
and literally

1273
01:01:45.268 --> 01:01:47.829
fuck your own face!

1274
01:01:47.831 --> 01:01:50.501
Now, I don't know what kind of
pan-Pacific bullshit power play

1275
01:01:50.503 --> 01:01:53.438
you're trying to pull here,
but Asia, Jack, is my territory.

1276
01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:56.341
<i>You better think again.</i>
<i>Otherwise, I'm gonna head down,</i>

1277
01:01:56.343 --> 01:01:59.376
and I will rain down an ungodly
fucking firestorm upon you.

1278
01:01:59.378 --> 01:02:01.616
You're gonna have to call
the fucking United Nations

1279
01:02:01.618 --> 01:02:03.685
and get a fucking
binding resolution

1280
01:02:03.687 --> 01:02:05.349
to keep me from
fucking destroying you.

1281
01:02:05.351 --> 01:02:08.487
<i>I am talking scorched earth,</i>
<i>motherfucker!</i>

1282
01:02:08.489 --> 01:02:10.325
I will massacre you!

1283
01:02:10.327 --> 01:02:12.486
I will fuck you up!

1284
01:02:19.595 --> 01:02:22.197
Could you find out who that was?
Go. Yeah. Yeah.

1285
01:02:57.137 --> 01:02:59.636
You wear these.
More like Simple Jack teeth.

1286
01:02:59.638 --> 01:03:01.737
Oh. Okay.

1287
01:03:01.739 --> 01:03:04.710
Hey. Look, I know you're a big
fan, and that's great--

1288
01:03:04.712 --> 01:03:06.413
Ooh!

1289
01:03:07.812 --> 01:03:09.543
Put teeth in!

1290
01:03:16.755 --> 01:03:18.392
Now do movie.

1291
01:03:18.394 --> 01:03:19.553
The whole movie?

1292
01:03:19.555 --> 01:03:21.994
I can't.
I don't know the whole--

1293
01:03:21.996 --> 01:03:24.797
You perform!
You perform or die!

1294
01:03:24.799 --> 01:03:27.066
I-- Hey-- Oh!
Monkey swine!

1295
01:03:29.701 --> 01:03:30.732
Oh, Pa.

1296
01:03:30.734 --> 01:03:31.834
Ooh!

1297
01:03:33.202 --> 01:03:35.303
More stupid.

1298
01:03:35.305 --> 01:03:38.545
Aah!
P-Pa, why you g-g-gotta

1299
01:03:38.547 --> 01:03:41.850
m-m-make me feel bad?

1300
01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.945
You saw what I saw.

1301
01:03:44.947 --> 01:03:47.583
Tugg Speedman is dead meat
if we don't do something soon.

1302
01:03:47.585 --> 01:03:49.485
Yeah. We could do something
by getting our asses

1303
01:03:49.487 --> 01:03:51.689
back to the hotel,
which is in the other direction.

1304
01:03:51.691 --> 01:03:53.390
They right.

1305
01:03:53.392 --> 01:03:55.493
What would've happened
in<i> The Great Escape</i>

1306
01:03:55.495 --> 01:04:00.034
if Steve McQueen and them
dudes had turned tail and ran?

1307
01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:01.494
Well, that's what
that movie was about.

1308
01:04:01.496 --> 01:04:03.431
They were escaping.
They ran away.

1309
01:04:03.433 --> 01:04:04.905
I'm trying to
agree with you.

1310
01:04:04.907 --> 01:04:06.400
The point is
they did something.

1311
01:04:06.402 --> 01:04:07.942
Then what are we
supposed to do?

1312
01:04:07.944 --> 01:04:09.742
He's cleaning a gun
with no bullets.

1313
01:04:09.744 --> 01:04:11.272
Yeah, that's a plan.

1314
01:04:11.274 --> 01:04:13.542
I'm just like a little boy

1315
01:04:13.544 --> 01:04:16.049
playing with his dick
when he's nervous.

1316
01:04:19.052 --> 01:04:20.783
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1317
01:04:20.785 --> 01:04:23.219
I got an idea.

1318
01:04:23.221 --> 01:04:24.923
This might be
a little crazy.

1319
01:04:24.925 --> 01:04:26.723
Crazy's better than nothing.

1320
01:04:26.725 --> 01:04:30.962
Back in '98, I did a low-budget
titty comedy for Skinemax.

1321
01:04:30.964 --> 01:04:33.730
<i>Sex Camp.</i> Remember it?

1322
01:04:33.732 --> 01:04:35.168
Yeah.

1323
01:04:35.170 --> 01:04:38.368
Anyway, me and the campers
from the uncool camp

1324
01:04:38.370 --> 01:04:40.837
had to break into
the rich-girl camp.

1325
01:04:40.839 --> 01:04:42.736
So, what we did,

1326
01:04:42.738 --> 01:04:46.011
we built a catapult
out of logs and underwear

1327
01:04:46.013 --> 01:04:48.109
and they shot us
over the wall

1328
01:04:48.111 --> 01:04:50.248
and we parachuted down.

1329
01:04:55.358 --> 01:04:56.516
Look,

1330
01:04:56.518 --> 01:04:58.788
you guys, we already
know the plan.

1331
01:04:58.790 --> 01:04:59.993
Fine.

1332
01:04:59.995 --> 01:05:01.862
We do it just
like in the book.

1333
01:05:01.864 --> 01:05:04.424
Chapter 26,
the Wet Offensive.

1334
01:05:04.426 --> 01:05:07.033
The book of<i> Tropic Thunder.</i>

1335
01:05:07.035 --> 01:05:09.634
Yeah, you-- Did you guys
read the book?

1336
01:05:09.636 --> 01:05:11.169
Mm, the flap,

1337
01:05:11.171 --> 01:05:12.935
I read the back flap
and saw the pictures.

1338
01:05:12.937 --> 01:05:17.378
Well, it's okay. It's exactly
the same as in the script.

1339
01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:19.915
Cool.

1340
01:05:19.917 --> 01:05:22.578
You guys all read
the script, right?

1341
01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:25.612
I don't read the script.
The script reads me.

1342
01:05:25.614 --> 01:05:27.615
What the hell
does that even mean?

1343
01:05:27.617 --> 01:05:29.755
What you getting at
with the books, scripts?

1344
01:05:29.757 --> 01:05:31.289
Spit that shit out, man!

1345
01:05:33.021 --> 01:05:34.388
I, uh--

1346
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:36.691
All right.
The Wet Offensive.

1347
01:05:36.693 --> 01:05:39.793
Osiris and Fats go undercover
as a diversion.

1348
01:05:39.795 --> 01:05:42.664
Motown and Brooklyn
sneak in via the river.

1349
01:05:42.666 --> 01:05:45.699
Yeah. But those dudes
was trained soldiers.

1350
01:05:47.036 --> 01:05:49.175
Yeah.

1351
01:05:49.177 --> 01:05:51.507
And we trained actors,
motherfucker.

1352
01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:54.442
Time to man up.

1353
01:05:54.444 --> 01:05:56.578
And I ain't
gonna sugarcoat.

1354
01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:59.482
Some of us might not even
make it back.

1355
01:05:59.484 --> 01:06:03.354
What do you mean? Like
not on the same flight?

1356
01:06:05.121 --> 01:06:08.026
Alpa and I's already wearing
earth mama's natural night camo.

1357
01:06:08.028 --> 01:06:10.328
- Cool it, Benson.
- Sorry.

1358
01:06:11.396 --> 01:06:13.727
We gonna scout,
get a plan together.

1359
01:06:13.729 --> 01:06:16.534
We ain't back in 20,
come looking.

1360
01:06:16.536 --> 01:06:19.403
<i>We are Flaming Dragon.</i>

1361
01:06:22.874 --> 01:06:24.210
Okay.

1362
01:06:25.311 --> 01:06:28.444
Flaming Dragons
are heroin manufacturers.

1363
01:06:28.446 --> 01:06:29.980

01:07:02.544 --> 01:07:04.512
<i>or tomorrow Simple Jack die.</i>

1378
01:07:04.514 --> 01:07:07.182
Great. Uh, let me
get this down.

1379
01:07:07.184 --> 01:07:09.220
One hundred million--

1380
01:07:09.222 --> 01:07:12.694
Oh, wait.
I got a better idea.

1381
01:07:12.696 --> 01:07:14.426
Instead of 100 million,

1382
01:07:14.428 --> 01:07:17.395
how about I send you
a hobo's dick cheese?

1383
01:07:17.397 --> 01:07:18.833
<i>Then you kill him.</i>
<i>Do your thing.</i>

1384
01:07:18.835 --> 01:07:20.032
<i>Skin the fucking bastard.</i>

1385
01:07:20.034 --> 01:07:22.267
Go to town, man.
Go to town.

1386
01:07:22.269 --> 01:07:24.232
No...
In the meantime, and as usual,

1387
01:07:24.234 --> 01:07:26.539
go fuck yourself.

1388
01:07:26.541 --> 01:07:28.142
No.

1389
01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:30.006
We don't negotiate
with terrorists.

1390
01:07:31.975 --> 01:07:35.116
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, are you insane?

1391
01:07:35.118 --> 01:07:36.982
I think I could've
done that better.

1392
01:07:36.984 --> 01:07:38.515
They're gonna kill him.

1393
01:07:43.688 --> 01:07:48.128
And we'll weep for him
in the press.

1394
01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:50.463
Set up a scholarship
in his name.

1395
01:07:50.465 --> 01:07:54.836
Eventually, and I'm talking way,
way down the road,

1396
01:07:54.838 --> 01:07:56.302
we file an
insurance claim.

1397
01:07:56.304 --> 01:07:59.074
Preferably before
the end of the fiscal year.

1398
01:07:59.076 --> 01:08:01.005
Actually, the claim alone
would net us more

1399
01:08:01.007 --> 01:08:03.177
than the movie would lose.

1400
01:08:04.275 --> 01:08:07.610
You can't be serious.

1401
01:08:08.883 --> 01:08:10.518
Let's face it.

1402
01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:14.716
The kids aren't dressing up
as Scorcher for Purim anymore.

1403
01:08:16.055 --> 01:08:19.193
Speedman is a dying star,

1404
01:08:19.195 --> 01:08:22.426
a white dwarf
heading for a black hole.

1405
01:08:22.428 --> 01:08:24.761
That's physics.
It's inevitable.

1406
01:08:24.763 --> 01:08:28.499
We've been handed an incredible
opportunity here, Peck.

1407
01:08:28.501 --> 01:08:32.399
The universe is talking to us
right now.

1408
01:08:32.401 --> 01:08:34.301
You just gotta listen.

01:08:49.621 --> 01:08:52.057
This is when the job gets fun.
Yeah.

1416
01:08:52.059 --> 01:08:56.223
Ask and you shall receive.

1417
01:08:56.225 --> 01:08:57.291
All right.

1418

You play ball,

1419
01:08:58.766 --> 01:09:00.594
we play ball.

1420
01:09:00.596 --> 01:09:04.169
I know you want
the goodies. Mm.

1421
01:09:04.171 --> 01:09:06.066
Welcome to
the goody room.

1422
01:09:06.068 --> 01:09:08.839
You paying attention?
'Cause I'm talking

1423
01:09:08.841 --> 01:09:11.939
G5 for the Pecker.
That's how you're gonna roll.

1424
01:09:11.941 --> 01:09:15.011
No more frequent flyer
bitch miles for my boy.

1425
01:09:15.013 --> 01:09:16.146
Mm-mm.

1426
01:09:16.148 --> 01:09:17.981
Oh, yeah.

1427
01:09:17.983 --> 01:09:20.588
Playa.

1428
01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:21.783
Playa.

1429
01:09:22.989 --> 01:09:24.254
Big-dick playa.

1430
01:09:24.256 --> 01:09:25.993
Swinging past your knees.

1431
01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:28.658
- Big dick, baby.
- Yep.

1432
01:09:31.698 --> 01:09:35.596
Or you can grow a conscience
in the next five minutes

1433
01:09:35.598 --> 01:09:37.667
and see where that takes you.

1434
01:09:42.043 --> 01:09:44.212
Now let me get this straight.

1435
01:09:44.214 --> 01:09:47.947
You want me
to let my client of 15 years,

1436
01:09:47.949 --> 01:09:49.383
one of my best friends,

1437
01:09:49.385 --> 01:09:54.519
die in the jungle, alone,
for some money and a G5?

1438
01:09:55.184 --> 01:09:57.489
Yes.

1439
01:10:01.356 --> 01:10:03.726
A G5 airplane?

1440
01:10:05.766 --> 01:10:07.967
Yes.

1441
01:10:07.969 --> 01:10:12.037
And lots of money.

1442
01:10:12.039 --> 01:10:14.536
Playa.

1443

1444
01:10:16.646 --> 01:10:18.411

rub it down. Whoa.

1448
01:10:27.984 --> 01:10:32.059
How many more sleeps
before she wakes up again?

1449
01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:33.553
Sorry, Jack.

1450
01:10:33.555 --> 01:10:35.856
She in heaven now.

1451
01:10:35.858 --> 01:10:40.098
Damn! I thought
the movie was bad.

1452
01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:42.903
She sleep forever.

1453
01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.230
To the man's credit,

1454
01:10:44.232 --> 01:10:46.472
he's actually eased up
on the retard throttle.

1455
01:10:46.474 --> 01:10:48.208
And now that's
added a balance

1456
01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:50.010
and the audience
can connect.

1457
01:10:50.012 --> 01:10:51.746
I mean, this is Theater 101,

1458
01:10:51.748 --> 01:10:53.806
but, you know, the guy's had--
He's had a tough road.

1459
01:10:53.808 --> 01:10:55.416
He'll become a naturalist.

1460
01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:57.180
Yeah.
Break down the
aesthetic distance,

1461
01:10:57.182 --> 01:10:58.847
then the-- Ah!

1462
01:11:01.487 --> 01:11:03.357
Told you
I'd tag you back.

1463
01:11:05.755 --> 01:11:07.427
Can I tell you that I'm sorry

1464
01:11:07.429 --> 01:11:10.591
for any offense
I might've caused, man?

1465
01:11:10.593 --> 01:11:11.793
I just got caught up in--

1466
01:11:11.795 --> 01:11:14.635
In being a dumbass?
I guess so.

1467
01:11:14.637 --> 01:11:17.534
Why you still doing this Chicken
George shit, I have no idea.

1468
01:11:17.536 --> 01:11:18.972
Neither do I.
It's beyond me.

1469
01:11:18.974 --> 01:11:20.137
It's beyond me.

1470
01:11:20.139 --> 01:11:21.340
You confused.

1471
01:11:21.342 --> 01:11:23.036
I am a little confused.
I know.

1472
01:11:24.407 --> 01:11:26.374
But are we cool?

1473
01:11:26.376 --> 01:11:28.547
Not really.

1474
01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.387
Hey, man.

1475
01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:35.222
How's it going?
Good. Yourself?

1476
01:11:35.224 --> 01:11:37.120
Hey, so, if it's
no big deal,

1477
01:11:37.122 --> 01:11:40.293
I think I'm just gonna hang
back here for the mission.

1478
01:11:40.295 --> 01:11:42.824
Watch the stuff.
Is that cool?

1479
01:11:42.826 --> 01:11:46.200
What? No.
Uh, we need you, Jeff.

1480
01:11:46.202 --> 01:11:47.967
What--? What are you
talking about?

1481
01:11:47.969 --> 01:11:50.599
Okay, look, man.

1482
01:11:50.601 --> 01:11:52.002
I got something
to tell you.

1483
01:11:52.004 --> 01:11:53.334
Okay.

1484
01:11:55.037 --> 01:11:57.905
You know those jellybeans
I was eating?

1485
01:11:57.907 --> 01:12:02.016
Well, they weren't
jellybeans, okay?

1486
01:12:02.018 --> 01:12:04.549
They were drugs.
Really?

1487
01:12:04.551 --> 01:12:06.683
I get down there
near the mother lode,

1488
01:12:06.685 --> 01:12:09.216
I am done.
I'm jonesing bad, man.

1489
01:12:09.218 --> 01:12:12.525
I'm gonna fucking do all
the heroin in the fucking world.

1490
01:12:15.223 --> 01:12:17.297
If you guys wanna make it
through this thing,

1491
01:12:17.299 --> 01:12:19.465
you gotta strap me
to a tree.

1492
01:12:19.467 --> 01:12:22.799
Oh. Rea--? Are you--?
Are you serious?

1493
01:12:22.801 --> 01:12:24.969
Yeah, I'm serious.
Literally, a tree.

1494
01:12:24.971 --> 01:12:27.637
No matter what, you can't
untie me until it is done,

1495
01:12:27.639 --> 01:12:29.337
until it is
out of my system.

1496
01:12:29.339 --> 01:12:31.411
I'm gonna say, "Hey, man,
I'm cool. It's cool.

1497
01:12:31.413 --> 01:12:33.042
I'm finally better.
Untie me."

1498
01:12:33.044 --> 01:12:36.048
Don't listen to me. Anything
I fucking say is a lie.

1499
01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:38.281
You got it.

1500
01:12:38.283 --> 01:12:40.553
Goodbye, Mama.

1501
01:12:40.555 --> 01:12:43.483
Now you can have
ice cream in heaven.

1502
01:12:43.485 --> 01:12:49.661
I'll see you tonight, when I go
to bed, in my head movies.

1503
01:12:49.663 --> 01:12:54.768
But this head movie
makes my eyes rain.

1504
01:13:03.343 --> 01:13:04.543
Ooh, dang.

1505
01:13:04.545 --> 01:13:07.045
Gilligan catching
a kidney shot.

1506
01:13:07.047 --> 01:13:08.412
Shh. Shh.

1507
01:13:08.414 --> 01:13:09.614
They got him on the move.

1508
01:13:09.616 --> 01:13:11.112
That's torture, man.

1509
01:13:11.114 --> 01:13:14.182
Okay. That's where
they keeping him.

1510
01:13:14.184 --> 01:13:16.117
I gotta get cracking
on my costume.

1511
01:13:16.119 --> 01:13:18.225
Say, are you good
with a needle and thread?

1512
01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:20.058
Hell, yeah. Alpa Chino chinos

1513
01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:22.725
sold more than five million
pairs last spring at the Gap.

1514
01:13:22.727 --> 01:13:24.262
I sewed them patterns
myself, baby.

Really makes a guy

01:14:45.242 --> 01:14:48.043
This could be the last time
we look at these stars.

1534

Man, that's beauty.

1535
01:14:52.214 --> 01:14:53.814

what it's all about.

1537
01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:57.954
Hey, you guys.
Anybody got some bug spray?

1538
01:14:59.655 --> 01:15:01.062
Don't ignore me!

1539
01:15:01.064 --> 01:15:02.462
Stick it out, man.

1540
01:15:02.464 --> 01:15:04.191
We're gonna get
through this.

1541
01:15:05.201 --> 01:15:07.734
Hey, Kirk?
Yeah?

1542
01:15:07.736 --> 01:15:10.029
Are you still dating
Jennifer Love Hewitt?

1543
01:15:10.031 --> 01:15:11.572
Because I think she's hot.

1544
01:15:11.574 --> 01:15:14.902
No, that was just
some tabloid conjecture.

1545
01:15:14.904 --> 01:15:17.105
Hey, guys, I'm good. Ha, ha!

1546
01:15:17.107 --> 01:15:19.510
I made it through.
You can untie me now.

1547
01:15:19.512 --> 01:15:20.944
Funny, huh?

1548
01:15:20.946 --> 01:15:24.816
The circus life
280 days a year on location.

1549
01:15:26.418 --> 01:15:29.818
It's hard to find a girl that
can hang with that, you know?

1550
01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:32.456
Not one worth keeping, nohow.

1551
01:15:32.458 --> 01:15:35.058
Hey, Radar? Evans?

1552
01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:36.993
No, it's Kevin.
Kev-- Whatever the fuck.

1553
01:15:36.995 --> 01:15:38.733
Come over here.
I didn't tell you,

1554
01:15:38.735 --> 01:15:40.601
but<i> Fatties: Fart Three</i>
is coming down the pike

1555
01:15:40.603 --> 01:15:42.062
and there's a role
in there for you

1556
01:15:42.064 --> 01:15:43.804
if you come over
and untie me.

1557
01:15:43.806 --> 01:15:46.673
Jeff, you're just going
to have to tough it out.

1558
01:15:46.675 --> 01:15:48.603
Your mother's
a cankerous whore!

1559
01:15:48.605 --> 01:15:50.538
Jesus, man.

1560
01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:51.976
Hey, man.

1561
01:15:51.978 --> 01:15:54.214
Remember way back
when I said your mother

1562
01:15:54.216 --> 01:15:55.483
was a cankerous whore?

1563
01:15:55.485 --> 01:15:57.710
I'm sorry, man.
I did not mean that.

1564
01:15:57.712 --> 01:15:58.812
She's not.

1565
01:15:58.814 --> 01:16:00.654
How about you, man?

1566
01:16:00.656 --> 01:16:02.082
You got some little
minx waiting for you

1567
01:16:02.084 --> 01:16:03.417
on the other side
of tomorrow?

1568
01:16:03.419 --> 01:16:04.891
Me?

1569
01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:08.255
No, I've barely even
had a girlfriend and...

1570
01:16:08.257 --> 01:16:10.363
I was really hoping
I'd get laid

1571
01:16:10.365 --> 01:16:11.828
when this movie came out,

1572
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:15.161
but that's not gonna happen.

1573
01:16:15.163 --> 01:16:16.837
What about you,
masterblaster?

1574
01:16:16.839 --> 01:16:18.865
You got a certain someone
you trying to get with

1575
01:16:18.867 --> 01:16:19.899
back in the States?

1576
01:16:19.901 --> 01:16:21.708
What, Alpa Chino?

1577
01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:24.170
He's like ten girls
deep, 24/7.

1578
01:16:24.172 --> 01:16:26.011
No. You missing me, man.

1579
01:16:26.013 --> 01:16:28.313
I'm talking about something
special. Big difference.

1580
01:16:28.315 --> 01:16:29.543
How about it?

1581
01:16:29.545 --> 01:16:31.014
Yeah.

1582
01:16:32.451 --> 01:16:34.487
Yeah, there is.

1583
01:16:34.489 --> 01:16:36.357
Well? What's the skinny?

1584
01:16:36.359 --> 01:16:37.750
Y'all been on a date, or what?

1585
01:16:37.752 --> 01:16:39.589
No. I mean...

1586
01:16:39.591 --> 01:16:41.356
I always wanted to,

1587
01:16:41.358 --> 01:16:44.530
but I guess I just never
had the-- The courage to ask.

1588
01:16:44.532 --> 01:16:46.728
It's-- It's complicated.

1589
01:16:46.730 --> 01:16:47.929
No!

1590
01:16:47.931 --> 01:16:49.096
It's simple as pie, man.

1591
01:16:49.098 --> 01:16:50.396
You plant your feet
in the ground,

1592
01:16:50.398 --> 01:16:52.399
you look her square
in the eyes, you say,

1593
01:16:52.401 --> 01:16:54.341
"Hey, baby, you
and me's going on a date."

1594
01:16:54.343 --> 01:16:55.539
That's the end of story.

1595
01:16:55.541 --> 01:16:56.906
What's her name?

1596
01:16:56.908 --> 01:17:01.180
Lance.
"Listen here, Lance..."

1597
01:17:01.182 --> 01:17:02.815
Lance?

1598
01:17:02.817 --> 01:17:05.111
What the fuck
did I just hear? Lance?

1599
01:17:05.113 --> 01:17:06.886
Did you say "Lance"?
No.

1600
01:17:06.888 --> 01:17:08.918
That sounded like "Lance."
No, I said "Nance."

1601
01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:10.456
That's what I said, "Nance."

1602
01:17:10.458 --> 01:17:11.524
It sounded like "Lance."

1603
01:17:11.526 --> 01:17:12.723
Look, I'm Alpa Chino, okay?

1604
01:17:12.725 --> 01:17:14.454
I love the pussy, all right?

1605
01:17:14.456 --> 01:17:16.662
Lay your ass back down
and look at the stars.

1606
01:17:16.664 --> 01:17:18.094
When you wrote
"I Love the Pussy,"

1607
01:17:18.096 --> 01:17:19.992
was you thinking of
dangling your dice

1608
01:17:19.994 --> 01:17:21.669
on Lance's forehead?

1609
01:17:21.671 --> 01:17:23.902
No, hell, no! What?
Come on. Look--

1610
01:17:23.904 --> 01:17:26.135
Man, everyone's gay
once in a while.

1611
01:17:26.137 --> 01:17:28.102
I'm not gay!
This is Hollywood.

1612
01:17:28.104 --> 01:17:29.609
How about we all
get back to work?

1613
01:17:29.611 --> 01:17:30.938
Okay. Cool.
This is ridiculous.

1614
01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:32.774
We got a big day tomorrow.

1615
01:17:32.776 --> 01:17:34.209
Let's get focused.

1616
01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:38.444
Alpa, if you untie me,

1617
01:17:38.446 --> 01:17:41.621
I will literally suck your dick
right now.

1618
01:17:41.623 --> 01:17:43.752
I told you,
for the last time,

1619
01:17:43.754 --> 01:17:46.024
I love the pussy!

1620
01:17:46.026 --> 01:17:48.892
I'll cradle the balls,
stroke the shaft,

1621
01:17:48.894 --> 01:17:51.798
work the pipe
and swallow the gravy.

1622
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:54.229
Get it over here, buddy.
Let's do this.

1623
01:18:00.402 --> 01:18:01.974
Okay, so, what's the plan?

1624
01:18:01.976 --> 01:18:03.809
Are you gonna talk Vietnamese
to those dudes?

1625
01:18:03.811 --> 01:18:05.442
No, no. Mandarin Chinese.

1626
01:18:05.444 --> 01:18:07.575
From what I can tell, it's what
they speaking down there.

1627
01:18:07.577 --> 01:18:09.915
- How you know Chinese?
<i>- Land of Silk and Money</i>

1628
01:18:09.917 --> 01:18:12.245
with Gong Li.
Second Globe, third Oscar.

1629
01:18:12.247 --> 01:18:13.986
Prepped for that one
by working

1630
01:18:13.988 --> 01:18:17.084
in a Beijing textile factory
for eight months.

1631
01:18:17.086 --> 01:18:18.955
That might be
our ride.

1632
01:18:28.296 --> 01:18:29.902
The straps are too tight!

1633
01:18:29.904 --> 01:18:31.569
Shut your mouth
and follow my lead.

1634
01:19:24.853 --> 01:19:26.189
Okay.

1635
01:19:28.527 --> 01:19:30.394
All right.

1636
01:19:30.396 --> 01:19:32.791
That looks like it could be
the munitions hut right there.

1637
01:19:32.793 --> 01:19:35.000
I'll try to find Speedman
in the main building.

1638
01:19:56.386 --> 01:19:58.791
What are you guys doing here?
He has hands.

1639
01:19:58.793 --> 01:20:00.424
He killed Damien.
Bullshit!

1640
01:20:00.426 --> 01:20:01.462
Shh!

1641
01:20:01.464 --> 01:20:02.829
He blinded Jamie Lee Curtis.

1642
01:20:02.831 --> 01:20:05.095
Almost!
What are you talking about?

1643
01:20:05.097 --> 01:20:06.994
Damien stepped
on a old land mine.

1644
01:20:06.996 --> 01:20:09.068
Oh, sweet. Thank God.

1645
01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:11.168
We busting Speedman out.
Speedman's here?

1646
01:20:20.276 --> 01:20:21.541
They got my boom-boom
up here.

1647
01:20:21.543 --> 01:20:22.948
I take it y'all are doing

1648
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:24.817
the Wet Offensive
from the book.

1649
01:20:24.819 --> 01:20:25.947
I can give y'all a diversion.

1650
01:20:25.949 --> 01:20:27.454
I got enough shit here

1651
01:20:27.456 --> 01:20:28.515
to light this place up

1652
01:20:28.517 --> 01:20:30.352
like it's the Fourth
of fucking July.

1653
01:21:05.557 --> 01:21:07.125
Uh...

1654
01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:14.627
Yes, your farm.

1655
01:21:18.473 --> 01:21:21.007
Where is your farm?

1656
01:21:22.575 --> 01:21:23.911
American!

1657
01:21:26.645 --> 01:21:28.146
My farm?

1658
01:21:29.813 --> 01:21:31.884
Oh, shit.

1659
01:21:31.886 --> 01:21:33.382
Here's my motherfucking farm!

1660
01:21:41.123 --> 01:21:43.090
Yeah!

1661
01:21:43.092 --> 01:21:44.459
Chicka-chickaw, baby!

1662
01:21:45.894 --> 01:21:47.902
Kwan-Lo!

1663
01:21:47.904 --> 01:21:50.733
I'm a lead farmer,
motherfucker!

1664
01:21:50.735 --> 01:21:52.469
Yeah!

1665
01:21:52.471 --> 01:21:53.432
Huh?

1666
01:21:53.434 --> 01:21:55.102
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1667
01:21:55.104 --> 01:21:56.602
Keep your head down!

1668
01:21:56.604 --> 01:21:58.538
Keep your head
down on the ground!

1669
01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:01.675
Nobody move or I do
the little big guy!

1670
01:22:01.677 --> 01:22:03.783
That's right, we running
this program now, J.P.

1671
01:22:03.785 --> 01:22:07.520
Now, show me
where the drugs are.

1672
01:22:07.522 --> 01:22:08.989
What the fuck?

1673
01:22:09.822 --> 01:22:11.019
That ain't the plan!

1674
01:22:11.021 --> 01:22:13.994
Don't judge me!

1675
01:22:15.657 --> 01:22:18.828
He's got a real
serious problem.

1676
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:21.601
Hey! Hey, you!

1677
01:22:21.603 --> 01:22:23.168
Take off your clothes.

1678
01:22:24.001 --> 01:22:25.869
Take off your clothes!

1679
01:22:25.871 --> 01:22:27.170
Uh, what do we do now?

1680
01:22:27.172 --> 01:22:29.305
Stick with the plan.
Find Speedman.

1681
01:22:29.307 --> 01:22:30.604
Alpa, keep this
clown posse down.

1682
01:22:30.606 --> 01:22:32.272
- Come on, now.
- Y'all heard the man.

1683
01:22:32.274 --> 01:22:34.047
Be suede, don't move!

1684
01:22:34.049 --> 01:22:37.146
Whoo! Fuck your do-rag.
Fuck your do-rag.

1685
01:22:37.148 --> 01:22:38.682
Go!
One, two, three!

1686
01:22:52.326 --> 01:22:54.364
I go high, you go low.

1687
01:22:59.203 --> 01:23:00.500
Get down. Get down. Get down.

1688
01:23:00.502 --> 01:23:02.601
Chow Yun-Fat,
get the hell down.

1689
01:23:02.603 --> 01:23:04.638
If I see one more
head pop up,

1690
01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:06.640
it's gonna be
bullet Whac-A-Mole.

1691
01:23:08.445 --> 01:23:10.380
- Come on, come on.
- Smoke grenade.

1692
01:23:12.084 --> 01:23:14.417
Here.
What's this?

1693
01:23:14.419 --> 01:23:16.089
I don't know
what it's called.

1694
01:23:16.091 --> 01:23:19.087
I just know the sound
it makes when it lies.

1695
01:23:19.089 --> 01:23:20.791
Don't move, matchbox,

1696
01:23:20.793 --> 01:23:22.262
or I will shoot you.

1697
01:23:22.264 --> 01:23:25.632
I'm gonna put on
this thing. Don't move.

1698
01:23:25.634 --> 01:23:27.166
I can still see you.

1699
01:23:33.706 --> 01:23:35.108
Tugg.

1700
01:23:37.138 --> 01:23:38.738
Tugg?

1701
01:23:40.108 --> 01:23:41.444
Gotcha.

1702
01:23:43.217 --> 01:23:45.386
Roll your shit up, man.
We going home.

1703
01:23:45.388 --> 01:23:47.087
Home?

1704
01:23:48.418 --> 01:23:50.417
But I'm doing
five shows a day

1705
01:23:50.419 --> 01:23:53.026
for a standing-room-only crowd.

1706
01:23:53.028 --> 01:23:56.088
Don't you get it?
I already am home.

1707
01:23:56.090 --> 01:23:57.724
Uh-oh.

1708
01:23:57.726 --> 01:24:00.998
All right, now, dude,
you gotta get it--

1709
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.198
My son gave this to me.

1710
01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:05.133
That's your stick buddy?

1711
01:24:05.135 --> 01:24:06.806
His name is Twigman.

1712
01:24:06.808 --> 01:24:09.609
Does he wanna come with us?

1713
01:24:14.649 --> 01:24:16.314
Ah! Ooh! oh!

1714
01:24:29.227 --> 01:24:30.757
Get the hell down!

1715
01:24:30.759 --> 01:24:32.326
Hold, what you doing?
What you doing?

1716
01:24:32.328 --> 01:24:33.727
Don't touch that gun.

1717
01:24:33.729 --> 01:24:35.530
Don't do it.
Don't touch that gun.

1718
01:24:35.532 --> 01:24:37.299
On my momma,
if you touch that gun...

1719
01:24:42.539 --> 01:24:45.079
Oh, shit, it's on!
Over here!

1720
01:25:16.338 --> 01:25:18.412
Shadow me, Pinocchio.

1721
01:25:18.414 --> 01:25:19.839
Smoke.

1722
01:25:31.693 --> 01:25:32.852
Jeff, don't!

1723
01:25:34.193 --> 01:25:36.060
It doesn't matter what I do.

1724
01:25:36.062 --> 01:25:37.523
I'll always be a screw-up.

1725
01:25:37.525 --> 01:25:39.596
No one will ever respect me.

1726
01:25:39.598 --> 01:25:41.397
That is not true,
you are not a screw-up.

1727
01:25:41.399 --> 01:25:43.465
You make
so many people laugh.

1728
01:25:43.467 --> 01:25:45.665
They only laugh
at my farts.

1729
01:25:45.667 --> 01:25:48.137
Jeff, we really need
to go now.

1730
01:25:48.139 --> 01:25:50.471
This is all I deserve.

1731
01:26:09.932 --> 01:26:11.594
Laugh at that, you bastards!

1732
01:26:11.596 --> 01:26:14.564
Ha, ha, ha!
Oh, hilarious! Hilarious!

1733
01:26:16.771 --> 01:26:18.238
Let's move.

1734
01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.339
We only have 16 hours
before they wake up.

1735
01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:29.316
Sounds like
the dinner bell's ringing.

1736
01:26:29.318 --> 01:26:31.081
These assholes are
gonna be crawling in here

1737
01:26:31.083 --> 01:26:32.483
ready to fucking eat us.

1738
01:26:34.587 --> 01:26:36.718
There. All right,
you keep six right here.

1739
01:26:39.455 --> 01:26:42.024
Come on, let's go.

1740
01:26:42.026 --> 01:26:44.292
Come on, what are you guys
doing? Let's get out of here.

1741
01:26:44.294 --> 01:26:45.862
He's on tilt status.

1742
01:26:45.864 --> 01:26:48.768
Same thing happened to me
when I played Neil Armstrong

1743
01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:50.301
in<i> Moonshot.</i>

1744
01:26:50.303 --> 01:26:52.305
They found me in
an alley in Burbank

1745
01:26:52.307 --> 01:26:54.105
trying to re-enter
the Earth's atmosphere

1746
01:26:54.107 --> 01:26:55.701
in an old refrigerator box.

1747
01:27:00.982 --> 01:27:02.213
Give me the flamethrower.

1748
01:27:02.215 --> 01:27:03.414
You gotta start
the chopper.

1749
01:27:03.416 --> 01:27:04.678
No, fuck that.
Just give me this.

1750
01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:07.120
No time! I'll take care
of this!

1751
01:27:07.122 --> 01:27:09.952
All right.
Give me your hooks.

1752
01:27:09.954 --> 01:27:11.717
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
put them on again.

1753
01:27:11.719 --> 01:27:13.793
Just give me
your goddamn hooks.

1754
01:27:13.795 --> 01:27:14.788
All right. Here.

1755
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:16.956
Get those boys back
to the bird, pronto.

1756
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:22.995
Oh, shit! Enough!

1757
01:27:24.035 --> 01:27:26.372
Fake shit!

1758
01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:30.970
Fuck!

1759
01:27:37.445 --> 01:27:39.314
Go get your guys!

1760
01:27:39.316 --> 01:27:41.286
Get them to the chopper!

1761
01:27:41.288 --> 01:27:43.719
I'll take care of these yahoos.

1762
01:27:45.054 --> 01:27:47.657
You're gonna focus up now,
motherfucker, and say it.

1763
01:27:47.659 --> 01:27:49.455
"It's me, Tugg!"
It's me, Tugg.

1764
01:27:49.457 --> 01:27:50.690
That's right.

1765
01:27:50.692 --> 01:27:52.131
Now, Tugg who?
Tugg who?

1766
01:27:52.133 --> 01:27:54.460
I don't know. Who are you?

1767
01:27:54.462 --> 01:27:56.064
Me? I know who I am!

1768
01:27:56.066 --> 01:27:59.771
I'm a dude playing a dude
disguised as another dude.

1769
01:27:59.773 --> 01:28:00.968
What?

1770
01:28:00.970 --> 01:28:03.168
You a dude that don't know
what dude he is.

1771
01:28:03.170 --> 01:28:06.313
Or are you a dude who has
no idea what dude he is

1772
01:28:06.315 --> 01:28:07.743
and claims to know
what dude he is...

1773
01:28:07.745 --> 01:28:09.510
What the fuck are you guys
talking about?

1774
01:28:09.512 --> 01:28:10.609
...by playing other dudes?

1775
01:28:10.611 --> 01:28:11.911
I know what dude I am!

1776
01:28:11.913 --> 01:28:13.578
You're scared.
I ain't scared.

1777
01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:14.782
Scared of what?

1778
01:28:14.784 --> 01:28:16.950
Or scared of who?
Scared of who?

1779
01:28:16.952 --> 01:28:19.026
Come on, guys.
We really need to go.

1780
01:28:19.028 --> 01:28:20.987
Scared of you.

1781
01:28:23.791 --> 01:28:26.229
Jesus.

1782
01:28:26.231 --> 01:28:27.363
What's going on?

1783
01:28:27.365 --> 01:28:29.398
The dudes are emerging.

1784
01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:32.200
He's right, you know.

1785
01:28:32.202 --> 01:28:34.000
I am not

1786
01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:37.641
Sergeant Lincoln Osiris.

1787
01:28:41.015 --> 01:28:42.648
We gotta roll out.

1788
01:28:42.650 --> 01:28:46.617
Nor am I Father O'Malley.

1789
01:28:48.016 --> 01:28:50.951
Or Neil Armstrong.

1790
01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:02.129
I-- I think I might be nobody.

1791
01:29:02.131 --> 01:29:03.603
Wow.

1792
01:29:03.605 --> 01:29:06.604
The insecurity level
with you guys is ridiculous.

1793
01:29:08.274 --> 01:29:09.540
Everybody's got issues.

1794
01:29:09.542 --> 01:29:11.442
Yeah, man,
everybody got issues.

1795
01:29:11.444 --> 01:29:13.106
Come on.
You're Kirk Lazarus.

1796
01:29:13.108 --> 01:29:15.581
You're the whole reason
I got into acting.

1797
01:29:15.583 --> 01:29:18.283
I memorized every single
monologue you ever did

1798
01:29:18.285 --> 01:29:19.481
when I was in theater school.

1799
01:29:19.483 --> 01:29:21.620
- Really?
- Yeah.

1800
01:29:21.622 --> 01:29:23.854
And look, Tugg.
I saw<i> Scorcher I</i> 24 times

1801
01:29:23.856 --> 01:29:25.787
when I was in eighth grade.
That shit blew me away.

1802
01:29:25.789 --> 01:29:28.328
I got high to that shit.
You the man.

1803
01:29:28.330 --> 01:29:29.560
Yeah, man,<i> Scorcher I</i>
was great.

1804
01:29:29.562 --> 01:29:31.226
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

1805
01:29:31.228 --> 01:29:32.797
Tugg, Tugger,

1806
01:29:32.799 --> 01:29:35.565
you're the last piece
of the puzzle, buddy.

1807
01:29:35.567 --> 01:29:37.497
We need you.
Your men need you.

1808
01:29:37.499 --> 01:29:38.933
Are you with us?

1809
01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:44.370
I'm a rooster illusion.

1810
01:29:44.372 --> 01:29:46.446
Fuck it. We'll deal
with him later. Let's move.

1811
01:29:46.448 --> 01:29:49.041
Come on. Come on.
Double time. Gotta go.

1812
01:29:51.516 --> 01:29:52.914
Come on, come on,
come on.

1813
01:29:54.415 --> 01:29:55.950
Ah!

1814
01:29:57.519 --> 01:29:59.822
Bingo. Move out.

1815
01:30:04.158 --> 01:30:07.794
Just say no to this,
you drug-making midget.

1816
01:30:12.335 --> 01:30:13.737
God, hold on!

1817
01:30:19.947 --> 01:30:21.547
Four Leaf!

1818
01:30:25.514 --> 01:30:27.652
You grew hands?

1819
01:30:36.657 --> 01:30:38.091
RPG, gentlemen!

1820
01:30:40.369 --> 01:30:42.733
Where are you going?

1821
01:30:47.973 --> 01:30:50.774
Oh, my God. I am moving
to catering after this.

1822
01:31:12.098 --> 01:31:14.160
My ass!

1823
01:31:16.564 --> 01:31:18.564
My ass!

1824
01:31:19.668 --> 01:31:21.508
Hey, yo!

1825
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:23.235
We gotta get our
shit together, Tugg!

1826
01:31:23.237 --> 01:31:25.509
We gotta get his cracker ass
to the chopper!

1827
01:31:25.511 --> 01:31:26.975
Are you still crazy?

1828
01:31:26.977 --> 01:31:29.610
We gotta get Kandinsky
to the chopper!

1829
01:31:29.612 --> 01:31:31.584
It's Sandusky.

1830
01:31:32.779 --> 01:31:35.253
Kevin Sandusky.

1831
01:31:35.255 --> 01:31:36.651
That's my name.

1832
01:31:36.653 --> 01:31:38.222
You remembered my name.

1833
01:31:38.224 --> 01:31:40.385
Alpa, go help Cody.

1834
01:31:40.387 --> 01:31:43.425
Portnoy, get Sandusky
back to the chopper. Go!

1835
01:31:43.427 --> 01:31:45.058
Let's go!

1836
01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:47.094
Let's get out of here.

1837
01:31:59.707 --> 01:32:01.006
Hey, Leaf! Leaf!

1838
01:32:01.008 --> 01:32:03.144
Yeah.
Hit the plunger

1839
01:32:03.146 --> 01:32:04.947
as soon as they clear
the bridge.
Got it.

1840
01:32:06.551 --> 01:32:09.253
Come on! Get in the chopper!

1841
01:32:09.255 --> 01:32:10.584
Come on! Move!

1842
01:32:10.586 --> 01:32:12.053
Kirk! Wait!

1843
01:32:14.661 --> 01:32:16.156
What the hell is he doing?

1844
01:32:16.158 --> 01:32:18.059
Laz, I'm gonna
blow the bridge!

1845
01:32:18.061 --> 01:32:19.726
Leaf's about to
blow the bridge. Come on!

1846
01:32:19.728 --> 01:32:20.962
You don't have to!

1847
01:32:20.964 --> 01:32:22.194
You don't have to,
I'm staying.

1848
01:32:22.196 --> 01:32:23.735
No, I can't let you
do that, mate.

1849
01:32:23.737 --> 01:32:25.469
No, I'm telling you,
I'm not being crazy.

1850
01:32:25.471 --> 01:32:26.569
They'll listen to me.

1851
01:32:26.571 --> 01:32:27.902
I know it sounds weird,

1852
01:32:27.904 --> 01:32:29.542
but I have a connection
with them.

1853
01:32:29.544 --> 01:32:32.111
Get over here!
I have a son now.

1854
01:32:32.113 --> 01:32:33.238
Little Half Squat.

1855
01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:35.107
Who in crikey fuck
is Half Squat?

1856
01:32:35.109 --> 01:32:37.617
He's my son. He's my boy.

1857
01:32:37.619 --> 01:32:39.817
He needs me.
I have to go back to him.

1858
01:32:42.349 --> 01:32:44.520
You tell the world
what happened here.

1859
01:32:44.522 --> 01:32:45.923
What happened here?

1860
01:32:45.925 --> 01:32:49.123
I don't know, but you need
to tell them.

1861
01:32:51.033 --> 01:32:53.262
I got this.

1862
01:32:53.264 --> 01:32:54.366
Tugg!

1863
01:32:54.368 --> 01:32:56.568
You take care of the boys.

1864
01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:58.869
I'll deal
with these guys.

1865
01:33:00.137 --> 01:33:02.301
Where is he going?
We're gonna fucking die!

1866
01:33:03.341 --> 01:33:04.544
Laz, come on.

1867
01:33:04.546 --> 01:33:05.973
He joined the circus.
Let's go.

1868
01:33:05.975 --> 01:33:07.644
You've got hands.
Yeah.

1869
01:33:07.646 --> 01:33:09.015
Fuck! You've got hands?

1870
01:33:09.017 --> 01:33:11.183
Come on!

1871
01:33:11.185 --> 01:33:12.984
Come on! Get in!

1872
01:33:12.986 --> 01:33:15.115
He's staying?
Go! He's a lost cause, mate!

1873
01:33:15.117 --> 01:33:16.821
Get out of here!

1874
01:33:20.989 --> 01:33:23.262
I was wrong!
Blow the bridge!

1875
01:33:23.264 --> 01:33:24.994
Blow the fucking bridge!

1876
01:33:30.732 --> 01:33:32.731
I got this.

1877
01:33:32.733 --> 01:33:34.267
Leaf, no!

1878
01:34:18.351 --> 01:34:19.845
It's over.

1879
01:34:19.847 --> 01:34:21.550
He's gone.

1880
01:34:21.552 --> 01:34:25.090
Cody, we gotta go!

1881
01:34:25.092 --> 01:34:26.625
Look.

1882
01:34:45.612 --> 01:34:49.141
<i>♪ Hey, hey, hey ♪</i>

1883
01:34:49.143 --> 01:34:51.850
Think he's done. Cover me!

1884
01:34:53.016 --> 01:34:55.816
Come on! Wait, come back!

1885
01:34:55.818 --> 01:34:58.021
How do we cover him?

1886
01:34:58.986 --> 01:35:02.124
<i>♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪</i>

1887
01:35:02.126 --> 01:35:04.192
All right, game over.
Come on, mate.

1888
01:35:05.762 --> 01:35:06.826
You all right, man?

1889
01:35:06.828 --> 01:35:07.928
I'm cold.

1890
01:35:07.930 --> 01:35:10.133
I can't feel my legs.

1891
01:35:10.135 --> 01:35:12.298
No, no, they're in
a puddle, mate. See?

1892
01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:13.737
There's a puddle
right there.

1893
01:35:13.739 --> 01:35:15.002
No worries.
Oh. Good.

1894
01:35:15.004 --> 01:35:16.067

You guys came back for me.

1896
01:35:18.146 --> 01:35:19.645
Of course.

1897
01:35:19.647 --> 01:35:21.114
Hey. I want you
to know something.

1898
01:35:21.116 --> 01:35:22.744
What?

1899
01:35:22.746 --> 01:35:25.114
I know who you are.

1900
01:35:26.882 --> 01:35:29.382
You're my friend.

1901
01:35:31.557 --> 01:35:33.320
You're my brother.

1902
01:35:33.322 --> 01:35:36.488
But like a really cool
brother, you know?

1903
01:35:36.490 --> 01:35:38.327
Like a brother where
there was no animosity--

1904
01:35:38.329 --> 01:35:40.628
Don't look now, you got
some real tears going.

1905
01:35:40.630 --> 01:35:42.133
Really?

1906
01:35:42.135 --> 01:35:44.034
That's the stuff
that accolades are made of.

1907
01:35:44.036 --> 01:35:45.633
Oh, Jesus, let's go, man!

1908
01:35:45.635 --> 01:35:46.971
All right?

1909
01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:49.501

1930
01:38:00.974 --> 01:38:02.775
No, dickhead,
of course I could.

1931
01:38:02.777 --> 01:38:05.370

1932
01:38:05.372 --> 01:38:06.638
Well, I...
Now, go get drunk

1933
01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:09.111
and take credit
at all the parties.

1934
01:38:09.113 --> 01:38:10.416
I would never
do that to--

1935
01:38:10.418 --> 01:38:11.242
Ah, joking.

1936
01:38:11.244 --> 01:38:12.817
Yeah?
Yeah.

1937
01:38:12.819 --> 01:38:13.947

All right, we're having a--

1941
01:38:18.352 --> 01:38:19.550
Fuck, okay.
Thank you, Les.

1942
01:38:19.552 --> 01:38:21.052
Thank you.
You have a good night--

1943
01:38:21.054 --> 01:38:22.290
