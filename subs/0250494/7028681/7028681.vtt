1
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.650
- Hi.
- Hi.

2
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.703
- Hi!
- Hey!

3
00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.465
- Did you get the card?
- Yeah

4
00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:01.287
And five, and four, and three.

5
00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:03.024
- All right.
- Yeah!

6
00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:08.002
- Hi!
- Hey girls, sign!

7
00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:09.739
- My God!
- Yeah!

8
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.500
- Elle's gonna love it.
- Thanks.

9
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.411
- Hi.
- Thank you.

10
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.730
I love that restaurant!

11
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:11.941
I heard Madonna went into labor there.

12
00:03:11.942 --> 00:03:13.317
Gosh, I have to go shopping.

13
00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:15.236
Okay, I'll see you tonight.

14
00:03:15.237 --> 00:03:16.437
Okay, bye.

15
00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.101
Bruiser, what's this?

16
00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:24.370
Good luck tonight.

17
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.372
Elle and Warner forever.

18
00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:29.816
That's so cute.

19
00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:46.374
My gosh, you guys are so sweet.

20
00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:49.603
But I'm not positive it's
gonna happen tonight.

21
00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:50.438
Hello!

22
00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:51.731
He just had lunch with his grandmother.

23
00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:53.315
You know he got the rock.

24
00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:55.317
Why else would she have
flown in from Newport?

25
00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:58.154
It's not like she'd FedEx
a six-carat diamond.

26
00:03:58.155 --> 00:03:59.238
Do you really think?

27
00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.396
I can't believe you're getting engaged!

28
00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:03.659
My gosh.

29
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.704
You guys have to help me
pick out the perfect outfit.

30
00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:08.622
Come on.
Totally.

31
00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:09.999
I think you should go with the red.

32
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.625
It's the color of confidence.

33
00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:13.294
I don't understand why you're completely

34
00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:15.087
disregarding your signature color?

35
00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.380
He's proposing.

36
00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:18.507
I can't look like I
would on any other date.

37
00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:20.092
This is the date.

38
00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.094
The night I'll always remember.

39
00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.002
I wanna look special.

40
00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:26.348
Bridal.

41
00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.058
But not like I expect anything.

42
00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:30.019
There's nothing I love
more than a dumb blonde

43
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.979
with Daddy's plastic.

44
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.897
You know how he gets excited when he...

45
00:04:32.898 --> 00:04:33.939
Did you see this one?

46
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.257
We just got it in yesterday.

47
00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:39.487
Is this low-viscosity rayon?

48
00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:41.572
Yes, of course.

49
00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:43.657
With a half-loop top
stitching on the hem?

50
00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:46.692
Absolutely, it's one of a kind.

51
00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:49.830
It's impossible to use a
half-loop top stitching

52
00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:51.207
on low-viscosity rayon.

53
00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:53.459
It would snag the fabric.

54
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.585
And you didn't just get it in.

55
00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:56.420
I saw it in a June Vogue a year ago.

56
00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:59.048
So if you're trying to sell
it to me for full price,

57
00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:01.366
you picked the wrong girl.

58
00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:07.413
Girls, this is it.

59
00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.267
In a few hours,

60
00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:13.552
I'll be the future Mrs.
Warner Huntington III.

61
00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:27.526
Hello.

62
00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:49.390
You look so beautiful.

63
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:50.591
So do you.

64
00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:02.343
Let's get out of here.

65
00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:07.357
Okay.

66
00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.738
It must be strange
having such perfect eyes.

67
00:06:23.592 --> 00:06:24.925
God, you're so wonderful.

68
00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:26.367
Elle, thank you.

69
00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:31.307
Here's to us.

70
00:06:31.308 --> 00:06:32.508
To us.

71
00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:43.527
- Elle.
- Yes?

72
00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:45.321
One of the reasons I
wanted to come here tonight

73
00:06:45.322 --> 00:06:47.948
was to discuss our future.

74
00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:51.118
And I am fully amenable
to that discussion.

75
00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:51.952
Good.

76
00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:52.786
Well, you know how we've been having

77
00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:54.496
all kinds of fun lately?

78
00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:55.331
Yeah.

79
00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:58.626
Well, Harvard is gonna be different.

80
00:06:58.627 --> 00:07:00.711
Law school is a completely
different world,

81
00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:02.755
and I need to be serious.

82
00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:03.956
Of course.

83
00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:07.551
I mean, my family expects a lot from me.

84
00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:08.385
Right.

85
00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:10.512
I expect a lot from me.

86
00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:12.848
I plan on running for office some day.

87
00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:14.099
And I fully support that, Warner.

88
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.975
You know that, right?

89
00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:15.893
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

90
00:07:15.894 --> 00:07:17.061
But the thing is,

91
00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:20.564
if I'm gonna be a senator
by the time I'm 30,

92
00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:22.483
I need to stop dicking around.

93
00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:25.392
Warner, I completely agree.

94
00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:31.315
Well, that's why I
think it's time for us,

95
00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:33.643
Elle, Pooh Bear.

96
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.070
Yes?

97
00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:38.738
- I do.
- I think we should break up.

98
00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:44.338
What?

99
00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:45.381
Well, I've been thinking about it,

100
00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:47.549
and I think it's the right thing to do.

101
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.552
You're breaking up with me?

102
00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:52.513
I thought you were proposing.

103
00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:54.348
Proposing?

104
00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:55.683
Elle!

105
00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:57.309
If I'm gonna be a senator,

106
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.063
well, I need to marry a
Jackie, not a Marilyn.

107
00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:01.897
So you're breaking up with me

108
00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:03.964
because I'm too blonde?

109
00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:07.152
No, that's not entirely true.

110
00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.070
Then what?

111
00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:09.512
My boobs are too big?

112
00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:12.658
Your boobs are fine.

113
00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:14.994
So when you said you
would always love me,

114
00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:16.829
you were just dicking around?

115
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.987
Elle, I, I do love you, I.

116
00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:22.001
I just can't marry you.

117
00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:24.837
You have no idea the
pressure that I am under.

118
00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:27.047
My family has five
generations of senators.

119
00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:29.758
My brother's in the top three at Yale Law,

120
00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:32.292
and he just got engaged to a
Vanderbilt, for Christ's sake!

121
00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:45.515
Bad salad.

122
00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:49.221
Sweetie, Pooh Bear?

123
00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:57.393
It's not like I have a
choice here, sweetheart.

124
00:08:58.163 --> 00:08:59.872
Okay, you get the car.

125
00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:00.706
I'll get the check.

126
00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:03.695
I won't be having salad.

127
00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:12.342
Come on, let me take you home.

128
00:09:12.343 --> 00:09:13.677
No.

129
00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:16.597
Elle, believe me, I
never expected to do this.

130
00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:18.474
But I think it's the right thing.

131
00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:19.767
How can it be the right thing

132
00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:21.769
when we're not together?

133
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.479
Well, I have to think of my future

134
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.314
and what my family expects of me.

135
00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:26.482
So you're breaking up with me

136
00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:29.568
because you're afraid
your family won't like me?

137
00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:31.361
Everybody likes me.

138
00:09:31.362 --> 00:09:33.739
Well, East Coast people are different.

139
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.240
What, just because I'm not a Vanderbilt,

140
00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:36.575
suddenly I'm white trash?

141
00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:37.951
I grew up in Bel Air, Warner,

142
00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:39.787
across the street from Aaron Spelling.

143
00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:40.788
I think most people would agree

144
00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:44.124
that's a lot better than
some stinky old Vanderbilt.

145
00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:47.363
I told you, I need someone serious.

146
00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:52.540
Well, I'm seriously in love with you.

147
00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:56.386
Isn't that enough?

148
00:09:56.387 --> 00:09:59.295
Pooh Bear, just get in the car.

149
00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:04.645
No.

150
00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:08.135
You're gonna ruin your shoes.

151
00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:13.145
Okay.

152
00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:04.649
Morning, Amy.

153
00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:11.295
Elle, it's Amy.

154
00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:13.964
I'm having trouble with
this whole lip-liner thing.

155
00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:16.008
Sweetie, didn't you hear?

156
00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:17.050
Hear what?

157
00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:19.868
It's terrible, dumped her.

158
00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:23.348
Why me?

159
00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:24.683
Because you're not gonna remember

160
00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:26.750
anything after tonight.

161
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.481
You're wrong.

162
00:11:31.482 --> 00:11:34.299
I will remember, no matter what.

163
00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:38.697
And I'm never gonna lose you again.

164
00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:40.105
You couldn't.

165
00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:43.475
You're a part of me.

166
00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:45.821
I love you.

167
00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:47.864
Liar!

168
00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.210
Honey, you have to leave this room.

169
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.837
It's been, like, a week.

170
00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:54.630
So?

171
00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:56.632
Drink this.

172
00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:58.050
What's the one thing that always

173
00:11:58.051 --> 00:12:00.208
makes us feel better, no matter what?

174
00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:07.684
She had eight grilled-cheese sandwiches.

175
00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:09.353
She just stuffed 'em in
her mouth, all at once.

176
00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:10.896
It was so sad.

177
00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:13.190
We all thought she'd be the
first to walk down the aisle,

178
00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:16.151
and now she's totally adrift.

179
00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.352
Totally.

180
00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.573
She hasn't conditioned
her hair in like a week.

181
00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:23.533
Maybe she's
going for the grunge look.

182
00:12:23.534 --> 00:12:25.994
And, like, her
nails are full-on chipped.

183
00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:27.731
So trailer park.

184
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.759
My God!

185
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.261
Do you know who this is?

186
00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:43.136
No.

187
00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:45.097
That's Warner's older brother.

188
00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:46.390
Who?

189
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:48.016
Third-year Yale Law student,

190
00:12:48.017 --> 00:12:49.685
Putnam Bowes Huntington III

191
00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:53.397
and his fiancee, Layne Walker Vanderbilt,

192
00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:55.305
first year, Yale Law.

193
00:12:57.151 --> 00:13:01.280
This is the type of
girl Warner wants to marry.

194
00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:03.740
This is what I need to
become to be serious.

195
00:13:03.741 --> 00:13:04.658
What?

196
00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:06.660
Practically deformed?

197
00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:07.861
No!

198
00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:10.438
A law student.

199
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.120
Elle?

200
00:13:17.588 --> 00:13:19.381
Law school?

201
00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:21.717
It's a perfectly
respectable place, Daddy.

202
00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:24.636
Honey, you were first runner-up

203
00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:27.055
at the Miss Hawaiian Tropics contest.

204
00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:29.308
Why are you gonna throw that all away?

205
00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:30.225
Going to Harvard is the only way

206
00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:32.394
I'm gonna get the love of my life back.

207
00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:34.771
Sweetheart, you
don't need law school.

208
00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:36.106
Law school's for people

209
00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:39.266
who are boring and ugly and serious.

210
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:44.229
And you, button, are none of those things.

211
00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:49.745
Harvard Law School?

212
00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:51.153
That's right.

213
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.458
But that's a top-three school.

214
00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:56.418
I have a 4.0.

215
00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:57.669
Yes.

216
00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:01.159
But your major is fashion merchandising.

217
00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:03.675
Harvard won't be impressed

218
00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:08.837
that you aced History
of Polka Dots.

219
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:11.516
What are your backups?

220
00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:12.893
I don't need backups.

221
00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:14.801
I'm going to Harvard.

222
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:16.730
Well, then.

223
00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:20.817
You'll need excellent
recommendations from your professors.

224
00:14:20.818 --> 00:14:21.943
Okay.

225
00:14:21.944 --> 00:14:24.404
And a heck of an admissions essay.

226
00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:25.489
Right.

227
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:28.558
And at least a 175 on your LSATs.

228
00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:33.538
I once had to judge
a tighty-Whitey contest

229
00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:34.998
for Lambda Kappa Pi.

230
00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:38.943
Trust me, I can handle anything.

231
00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:44.457
Thanks.

232
00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:46.626
Welcome.

233
00:14:48.262 --> 00:14:50.555
Because I have a metrabolism.

234
00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:52.974
I have a really high metrabolism.

235
00:14:52.975 --> 00:14:55.132
It's metab, metab.

236
00:14:57.855 --> 00:15:00.763
My God, what are you doing?

237
00:15:02.819 --> 00:15:05.570
Reading about the LSATs.

238
00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:07.197
My cousin had that.

239
00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:09.230
Apparently you get a really
bad rash on your.

240
00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:13.495
The LSATs are an exam.

241
00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:15.872
Girls, I'm going to Harvard.

242
00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:16.998
You mean, like, on vacay?

243
00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:18.291
Let's all go!

244
00:15:18.292 --> 00:15:19.778
Road trip!

245
00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:24.905
No, I'm going to Harvard Law School.

246
00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:27.459
Why?

247
00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:29.469
Elle,

248
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.471
now I know you're upset about all this,

249
00:15:31.472 --> 00:15:34.558
but can't you just take a Percocet?

250
00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:38.270
Okay, once Warner sees me
as a serious law student,

251
00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:39.438
he'll totally want me back.

252
00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:42.232
It's a completely brilliant plan.

253
00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:44.776
But isn't it
hard to get into law school?

254
00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:48.220
Well, I have the
highest GPA in Delta Nu.

255
00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:50.764
Well, here.

256
00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.785
You're gonna need this.

257
00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:55.245
Your scrunchie?

258
00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:57.289
My lucky scrunchie.

259
00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.332
It helped me pass Spanish.

260
00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:00.333
You passed Spanish

261
00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:02.377
because you gave Professor
Montoya a lap dance

262
00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:04.087
after the final.

263
00:16:04.088 --> 00:16:05.574
Yeah, luckily.

264
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.090
Hi.

265
00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:18.185
My name is Elle Woods,

266
00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:19.895
and for my admissions essay,

267
00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:21.938
I'm gonna tell all of you at Harvard

268
00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:25.025
why I'm gonna make an amazing lawyer.

269
00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:27.235
As president of my sorority,

270
00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:29.237
I'm skilled at commanding
the attention of a room,

271
00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:31.406
and discussing very important issues.

272
00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:33.533
It has come to my attention
that the maintenance staff

273
00:16:33.534 --> 00:16:38.695
is switching our toilet paper
from Charmin to generic.

274
00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:41.082
All those opposed to chafing, say aye.

275
00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:42.694
Aye.

276
00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:45.086
A, neither type of opera

277
00:16:45.087 --> 00:16:47.214
or neither type of rap is on sale.

278
00:16:47.215 --> 00:16:48.632
B, neither type of jazz

279
00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:50.800
and neither type of opera is on sale.

280
00:16:50.801 --> 00:16:52.219
C, neither type of opera

281
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.931
and neither type of soul.

282
00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:58.058
Delta Nu, we love you.

283
00:16:58.059 --> 00:17:01.228
- Yeah we love you, Delta!
- Hey.

284
00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:03.188
- Okay.
- Okay.

285
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:05.440
I'm able to recall
hundreds of important details

286
00:17:05.441 --> 00:17:06.858
at the drop of a hat.

287
00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.902
Hey, Elle, do you know what happened

288
00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:11.279
on Days of Our Lives yesterday?

289
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.114
Why yes, Margot, I do.

290
00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:15.784
Once again, we joined Hope in
the search for her identity.

291
00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:20.747
As you know, she's been
brainwashed by the evil Stefano.

292
00:17:20.748 --> 00:17:21.581
Three.

293
00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:23.375
Get set, and go!

294
00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:27.035
And six, seven, eight.

295
00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:34.502
143.

296
00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:43.426
I feel comfortable using
legal jargon in everyday life.

297
00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:46.838
I object!

298
00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:02.664
Finally it's here.

299
00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:03.999
- Elle!
- What?

300
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.501
- It's here.
- The LSAT scores!

301
00:18:06.502 --> 00:18:09.170
Open the scores!

302
00:18:09.171 --> 00:18:11.214
I'm so excited to know!

303
00:18:11.215 --> 00:18:12.882
Hurry, what if it's a top score,

304
00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:14.301
what the score?
Shh!

305
00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:15.260
What is it?

306
00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:16.845
- I'm so excited.
- Hello?

307
00:18:16.846 --> 00:18:18.046
What is it?

308
00:18:20.391 --> 00:18:21.591
179!

309
00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:33.511
179!

310
00:18:41.912 --> 00:18:44.831
And that's why you should
vote for me, Elle Woods,

311
00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:48.366
future lawyer, for the class of 2004.

312
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.469
She does have a 4.0 from CULA,

313
00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.208
and she got a 179 on her LSATs.

314
00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:03.016
A fashion major?

315
00:19:03.017 --> 00:19:04.768
Well, sir, we've never had one before,

316
00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:07.187
and aren't we always
looking for diversity?

317
00:19:07.188 --> 00:19:10.690
Her list of extracurricular
activities is impressive.

318
00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:12.901
She was in a Ricky Martin video.

319
00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:16.071
Clearly, she's interested in music.

320
00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:20.061
She also designed a
line of faux-fur panties

321
00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:22.994
for her sorority's charity project.

322
00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:24.704
She's a friend to the animals,

323
00:19:24.705 --> 00:19:27.192
as well as a philanthropist.

324
00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:29.361
Elle Woods.

325
00:19:32.546 --> 00:19:33.907
Welcome to Harvard.

326
00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:37.485
Bruiser, it's so exciting.

327
00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:38.361
Look!

328
00:20:38.362 --> 00:20:39.738
Harvard.

329
00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:41.146
Are you excited?

330
00:20:52.126 --> 00:20:54.377
This is our new house
for the next three years.

331
00:20:54.378 --> 00:20:56.004
Are you thirsty?

332
00:20:56.005 --> 00:20:56.838
- What is she wearing?
- Okay,

333
00:20:56.839 --> 00:20:59.340
let's get you some water.

334
00:20:59.341 --> 00:21:01.509
Sweetheart, you just look parched.

335
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:04.971
Hey, Brad,
check out Malibu Barbie.

336
00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:07.640
Where's the beach, honey?

337
00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:09.878
There you go, good boy.

338
00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.438
Warner's gonna be so excited to see you.

339
00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:14.814
Guys, this way.

340
00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:15.774
This ain't LA!

341
00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:16.891
Come on, Bruiser.

342
00:21:19.862 --> 00:21:22.781
Check it out, look at the way she walks.

343
00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:24.032
It's gonna be so exciting.

344
00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:26.441
Don't be scared, everyone will love you.

345
00:21:31.582 --> 00:21:33.489
Hi, Woods comma Elle.

346
00:21:38.714 --> 00:21:41.622
Class schedule, map, book list.

347
00:21:44.762 --> 00:21:46.179
Wait a second.

348
00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.015
My social events calendar is missing.

349
00:21:49.016 --> 00:21:50.016
Your what?

350
00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:50.850
Social events.

351
00:21:50.851 --> 00:21:55.671
You know, mixers, formals,
clambakes, trips to the Cape.

352
00:21:58.692 --> 00:22:02.320
Okay, has Warner Huntington
III checked in yet?

353
00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:03.521
Um.

354
00:22:04.323 --> 00:22:05.782
No.

355
00:22:05.783 --> 00:22:06.699
No, maybe you should check with

356
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.938
the cruise director on the lido deck.

357
00:22:11.872 --> 00:22:14.374
Okay, welcome to law school.

358
00:22:14.375 --> 00:22:16.793
This is the part where
we go around in a circle

359
00:22:16.794 --> 00:22:20.880
and everyone says a little
bit about themselves.

360
00:22:20.881 --> 00:22:22.549
Let's start with you.

361
00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.968
My name is David Kidney.

362
00:22:24.969 --> 00:22:28.263
I have a Master's in Russian literature,

363
00:22:28.264 --> 00:22:30.014
a PhD in biochemistry,

364
00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:32.350
and for the last 18 months,

365
00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:35.760
I've been deworming orphans in Somalia.

366
00:22:37.731 --> 00:22:38.898
Awesome.

367
00:22:38.899 --> 00:22:40.066
What about you?

368
00:22:40.067 --> 00:22:40.984
Hey, how you doin'?

369
00:22:40.985 --> 00:22:41.860
I'm Enid Wexler.

370
00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:43.820
Got a PhD from Berkeley
in women's studies,

371
00:22:43.821 --> 00:22:46.072
emphasis in the history of combat.

372
00:22:46.073 --> 00:22:48.825
And last year, I single-handedly organized

373
00:22:48.826 --> 00:22:51.536
the march for Lesbians
Against Drunk Driving.

374
00:22:51.537 --> 00:22:52.495
Killer.

375
00:22:52.496 --> 00:22:54.789
Thanks, good times.

376
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.040
Aaron Mitchell.

377
00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:58.126
I graduated first in my
class from Princeton.

378
00:22:58.127 --> 00:22:59.818
I have an IQ of 187.

379
00:23:00.546 --> 00:23:03.172
And it's been suggested
that Stephen Hawking

380
00:23:03.173 --> 00:23:08.334
stole his Brief History of Time
from my fourth-grade paper.

381
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.638
Cool.

382
00:23:10.639 --> 00:23:11.639
Me?

383
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.932
Yeah.

384
00:23:12.933 --> 00:23:15.643
Okay, hi, I'm Elle Woods

385
00:23:15.644 --> 00:23:17.478
and this is Bruiser Woods.

386
00:23:17.479 --> 00:23:20.023
We're both Gemini vegetarians.

387
00:23:20.024 --> 00:23:21.232
I have a bachelor's degree

388
00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:23.610
in fashion merchandising from CULA.

389
00:23:23.611 --> 00:23:26.321
And I was a Zeta Lambda Nu Sweetheart,

390
00:23:26.322 --> 00:23:28.406
president of my sorority, Delta Nu,

391
00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:32.066
and last year I was Homecoming Queen.

392
00:23:32.703 --> 00:23:34.537
Two weeks ago I saw
Cameron Diaz at Fred Segal,

393
00:23:34.538 --> 00:23:35.788
and I talked her out of buying

394
00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:37.790
this truly heinous angora sweater.

395
00:23:37.791 --> 00:23:39.334
Whoever said orange was the new pink

396
00:23:39.335 --> 00:23:41.492
was seriously disturbed.

397
00:23:46.675 --> 00:23:48.051
Wish me luck, Bruiser.

398
00:23:48.052 --> 00:23:52.917
This is my first class
as a serious law student.

399
00:23:57.227 --> 00:23:59.384
I totally look the part.

400
00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:09.730
Hi.

401
00:24:11.075 --> 00:24:12.275
Hey.

402
00:24:31.178 --> 00:24:32.378
Elle?

403
00:24:34.181 --> 00:24:35.381
Warner?

404
00:24:36.183 --> 00:24:37.976
I totally forgot you go here.

405
00:24:37.977 --> 00:24:40.603
What are you talking about?

406
00:24:40.604 --> 00:24:43.022
I'm sorry, are you here to see me?

407
00:24:43.023 --> 00:24:45.089
No, silly, I go here.

408
00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:47.944
You go where?

409
00:24:47.945 --> 00:24:49.932
Harvard, Law School.

410
00:24:50.823 --> 00:24:53.825
You got into Harvard Law?

411
00:24:53.826 --> 00:24:55.576
What, like it's hard?

412
00:24:55.577 --> 00:24:57.453
My gosh, it's gonna be so great.

413
00:24:57.454 --> 00:24:58.705
I'm planning this great mixer.

414
00:24:58.706 --> 00:25:00.039
You totally have to help me.

415
00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.001
I'm thinking, like, a luau
or maybe a casino night.

416
00:25:03.002 --> 00:25:07.037
This is gonna be just like
senior year, except for funner.

417
00:25:08.215 --> 00:25:10.258
Time to go, have to go to class,

418
00:25:10.259 --> 00:25:12.927
but meet me after, on the benches, okay?

419
00:25:12.928 --> 00:25:14.460
All right, bye!

420
00:25:30.487 --> 00:25:33.406
A legal education means

421
00:25:33.407 --> 00:25:37.066
you will learn to speak in a new language.

422
00:25:38.203 --> 00:25:40.163
You will be taught to achieve insight

423
00:25:40.164 --> 00:25:43.041
into the world around you,

424
00:25:43.042 --> 00:25:46.360
and to sharply question what you know.

425
00:25:49.256 --> 00:25:52.050
The seat you have picked will be yours

426
00:25:52.051 --> 00:25:55.369
for the next nine months of your life!

427
00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.668
And those of you in the front row,

428
00:26:00.601 --> 00:26:01.801
beware.

429
00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:07.899
"The law is reason free from passion."

430
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:12.060
Does anyone know who spoke
those immortal words?

431
00:26:14.114 --> 00:26:15.615
Yes?

432
00:26:15.616 --> 00:26:17.603
Aristotle.

433
00:26:22.706 --> 00:26:24.373
Are you sure?

434
00:26:24.374 --> 00:26:25.458
Yes.

435
00:26:25.459 --> 00:26:29.619
Would you be willing
to stake your life on it?

436
00:26:30.422 --> 00:26:31.658
I think so.

437
00:26:34.927 --> 00:26:36.127
What about

438
00:26:36.804 --> 00:26:38.370
his life?

439
00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:44.894
I don't know.

440
00:26:44.895 --> 00:26:48.714
Well, I recommend
knowing before speaking.

441
00:26:49.942 --> 00:26:53.681
The law leaves much
room for interpretation

442
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:57.309
but very little for self-doubt.

443
00:26:58.992 --> 00:27:00.728
And you were right.

444
00:27:02.329 --> 00:27:04.330
It was Aristotle.

445
00:27:04.331 --> 00:27:06.541
Good job.

446
00:27:06.542 --> 00:27:08.709
Now, I assume all of you have read

447
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:10.294
pages one through 48,

448
00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:13.840
and are now well-versed in
subject matter jurisdiction.

449
00:27:13.841 --> 00:27:17.176
Who can tell us about
Gordon versus Steele?

450
00:27:17.177 --> 00:27:22.338
Let's call on someone from
the hot zone.

451
00:27:37.698 --> 00:27:38.898
Elle Woods?

452
00:27:43.829 --> 00:27:48.239
Actually, I wasn't aware
that we had an assignment.

453
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:02.013
Vivian Kensington.

454
00:28:02.014 --> 00:28:06.642
Do you think it's acceptable
that Ms. Woods is not prepared?

455
00:28:06.643 --> 00:28:07.843
No.

456
00:28:10.981 --> 00:28:12.181
I don't.

457
00:28:12.858 --> 00:28:14.442
Would you support my decision

458
00:28:14.443 --> 00:28:16.569
to ask her to leave class,

459
00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:19.906
and to return only when she is prepared?

460
00:28:19.907 --> 00:28:21.143
Absolutely.

461
00:28:40.427 --> 00:28:41.886
Now, Ms. Kensington,

462
00:28:41.887 --> 00:28:45.348
Did diversity jurisdiction
exist in this case?

463
00:28:45.349 --> 00:28:47.666
No, it did not.

464
00:28:48.685 --> 00:28:49.727
Good.

465
00:28:49.728 --> 00:28:51.848
How about in the case of
Owens versus Mccullough.

466
00:29:04.034 --> 00:29:05.451
Who does she think she is?

467
00:29:05.452 --> 00:29:07.769
Excuse me, are you okay?

468
00:29:09.081 --> 00:29:10.539
Yeah.

469
00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:12.333
Do they just put you
on the spot like that,

470
00:29:12.334 --> 00:29:14.293
like, all the time?

471
00:29:14.294 --> 00:29:15.211
The professors?

472
00:29:15.212 --> 00:29:16.671
Yeah, they tend to do that.

473
00:29:16.672 --> 00:29:18.158
Socratic method.

474
00:29:19.341 --> 00:29:20.383
So, if you don't know the answer,

475
00:29:20.384 --> 00:29:22.802
they're just gonna kick you out?

476
00:29:22.803 --> 00:29:24.387
So you have Stromwell?

477
00:29:24.388 --> 00:29:25.680
Yes!

478
00:29:25.681 --> 00:29:26.764
Did she do that to you too?

479
00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:28.933
No, but she did make me cry once.

480
00:29:28.934 --> 00:29:29.892
I mean, not in class,

481
00:29:29.893 --> 00:29:31.394
I waited till I got back to my room.

482
00:29:31.395 --> 00:29:35.314
But she'll kick you right in
the ball-yeah, or wherever, you know.

483
00:29:35.315 --> 00:29:37.256
But, yeah, she's tough, really tough.

484
00:29:38.652 --> 00:29:39.694
Great.

485
00:29:39.695 --> 00:29:40.653
Don't worry, though, it gets better.

486
00:29:40.654 --> 00:29:42.780
Who else do you have?

487
00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:46.659
I have Callahan,
Royalton, and Levinthal.

488
00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.202
Yeah, let's see.

489
00:29:48.203 --> 00:29:49.412
Speak up in Callahan's class.

490
00:29:49.413 --> 00:29:51.497
He really likes people
that are opinionated.

491
00:29:51.498 --> 00:29:52.623
Okay.

492
00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:55.032
And in Royalton's class,

493
00:29:55.919 --> 00:29:57.503
try to get a seat in the back.

494
00:29:57.504 --> 00:30:00.617
He tends to spit when he talks
about products liability.

495
00:30:01.425 --> 00:30:03.259
And for Levinthal, you know,

496
00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:04.635
make sure you read the footnotes,

497
00:30:04.636 --> 00:30:05.469
'cause that's where he gets

498
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.972
a lot of his exam questions from.

499
00:30:07.973 --> 00:30:09.173
Right.

500
00:30:11.351 --> 00:30:14.089
I'm really glad I met you.

501
00:30:15.522 --> 00:30:16.722
Hey.

502
00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:19.066
Are you a third-year?

503
00:30:19.067 --> 00:30:21.777
- Well, I'm a...
- Hey, Elle.

504
00:30:21.778 --> 00:30:23.112
Hi.

505
00:30:23.113 --> 00:30:24.530
Thanks for all your help.

506
00:30:24.531 --> 00:30:25.731
Good luck.

507
00:30:27.951 --> 00:30:29.201
Hi, Warner.

508
00:30:29.202 --> 00:30:30.402
Hi.

509
00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:34.957
So, how was your first class?

510
00:30:34.958 --> 00:30:36.000
It was good,

511
00:30:36.001 --> 00:30:37.251
except for this horrible preppy girl

512
00:30:37.252 --> 00:30:38.627
who tried to make me look bad in front

513
00:30:38.628 --> 00:30:41.088
of the professor, but no biggie.

514
00:30:41.089 --> 00:30:42.048
You're here now.

515
00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:43.841
So how was your summer?

516
00:30:43.842 --> 00:30:45.593
Good, it's good.

517
00:30:45.594 --> 00:30:47.376
Did you do anything exciting?

518
00:30:49.598 --> 00:30:51.474
Hey!

519
00:30:51.475 --> 00:30:53.792
Have, have you met Vivian?

520
00:30:55.312 --> 00:30:57.799
Hi, Vivian Kensington.

521
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.109
Do you know her?

522
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:02.943
She's...

523
00:31:02.944 --> 00:31:04.601
I'm his fiance.

524
00:31:12.579 --> 00:31:14.622
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.

525
00:31:14.623 --> 00:31:16.207
What?

526
00:31:16.208 --> 00:31:20.503
Yeah, she, she was my
girlfriend in prep school.

527
00:31:20.504 --> 00:31:22.880
And well, we got back together this summer

528
00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:26.550
at my grandmother's birthday party.

529
00:31:26.551 --> 00:31:28.761
Warner told me all about you.

530
00:31:28.762 --> 00:31:31.079
You're famous at our club.

531
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:34.517
But he didn't tell me you'd be here.

532
00:31:34.518 --> 00:31:38.428
Pooh Bear, I didn't
know she would be here.

533
00:31:40.816 --> 00:31:42.427
Excuse me.

534
00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.042
Thank God!

535
00:32:00.043 --> 00:32:01.669
- What are you doing?
- Move it blonde.

536
00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:03.421
- Come on.
- Really, where are you going?

537
00:32:03.422 --> 00:32:05.989
- What are you doing?
- Figures, you couldn't drive.

538
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:18.644
Are you free?

539
00:32:18.645 --> 00:32:20.354
It's an emergency.

540
00:32:20.355 --> 00:32:21.555
Bad day?

541
00:32:22.524 --> 00:32:24.966
You can't even imagine.

542
00:32:27.863 --> 00:32:29.113
Spill.

543
00:32:29.114 --> 00:32:32.408
I worked so hard to get into law school.

544
00:32:32.409 --> 00:32:34.869
I blew off Greek Week
to study for the LSATS.

545
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:36.036
I even hired a Coppola

546
00:32:36.037 --> 00:32:37.913
to direct my admissions video.

547
00:32:37.914 --> 00:32:39.331
All to get my boyfriend Warner back,

548
00:32:39.332 --> 00:32:42.209
and now he's engaged to
this awful girl, Vivian.

549
00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:43.294
So it was all for nothing,

550
00:32:43.295 --> 00:32:45.031
and I, I just wish,

551
00:32:47.048 --> 00:32:50.843
I just wish I had never gone to Harvard.

552
00:32:50.844 --> 00:32:53.095
After you went to all that trouble.

553
00:32:53.096 --> 00:32:54.597
He's engaged.

554
00:32:54.598 --> 00:32:56.432
She's got the six-carat Harry Winston

555
00:32:56.433 --> 00:32:59.592
on her bony, unpolished finger.

556
00:33:02.355 --> 00:33:04.732
What am I supposed to do?

557
00:33:04.733 --> 00:33:06.775
You're askin' the wrong girl.

558
00:33:06.776 --> 00:33:09.111
I mean, I'm with my guy eight years,

559
00:33:09.112 --> 00:33:12.531
and then one day it's, I met someone else.

560
00:33:12.532 --> 00:33:13.908
Move out.

561
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:15.109
No.

562
00:33:16.077 --> 00:33:17.578
That's awful.

563
00:33:17.579 --> 00:33:18.621
Dewey kept the trailer

564
00:33:18.622 --> 00:33:21.109
and my precious baby, Rufus.

565
00:33:23.919 --> 00:33:26.378
I didn't even get to throw
him a birthday party.

566
00:33:26.379 --> 00:33:27.579
No!

567
00:33:28.507 --> 00:33:30.549
I mean, what's a girl to do?

568
00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:34.553
He's a guy who followed his
pecker to greener pastures,

569
00:33:34.554 --> 00:33:38.349
and I'm a middle-aged high school dropout

570
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:41.602
who's got stretch marks and a fat ass.

571
00:33:41.603 --> 00:33:43.103
That's terrible.

572
00:33:43.104 --> 00:33:45.421
Yeah, happens every day.

573
00:33:48.026 --> 00:33:50.694
So what's this Vivian
got that you don't have?

574
00:33:50.695 --> 00:33:52.404
Three tits?

575
00:33:52.405 --> 00:33:54.031
She's from Connecticut.

576
00:33:54.032 --> 00:33:56.700
She belongs to his stupid country club.

577
00:33:56.701 --> 00:33:59.018
Is she as pretty as you?

578
00:33:59.788 --> 00:34:00.996
She could use some mascara

579
00:34:00.997 --> 00:34:02.248
and some serious highlights,

580
00:34:02.249 --> 00:34:06.043
but she's not completely
unfortunate-looking.

581
00:34:06.044 --> 00:34:06.877
How ya doing?

582
00:34:06.878 --> 00:34:08.212
Neptunes.

583
00:34:08.213 --> 00:34:09.380
Hello, ladies.

584
00:34:09.381 --> 00:34:10.881
- Hey there.
- How ya doin'?

585
00:34:10.882 --> 00:34:12.082
Sign here.

586
00:34:19.641 --> 00:34:21.141
Gee!

587
00:34:21.142 --> 00:34:23.018
Look what I did.

588
00:34:23.019 --> 00:34:25.677
- See you later.
- Bye, sugar.

589
00:34:26.856 --> 00:34:28.056
Shit.

590
00:34:29.025 --> 00:34:32.152
Could I have been any
more goddamn spastic?

591
00:34:32.153 --> 00:34:33.353
It's okay.

592
00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:38.826
Are you sure this Warner
guy is, like, the one?

593
00:34:38.827 --> 00:34:41.064
Definitely, I love him.

594
00:34:44.708 --> 00:34:48.210
Well, if a girl like you
can't hold on to her man,

595
00:34:48.211 --> 00:34:53.372
then there sure as hell isn't
any hope for the rest of us.

596
00:34:53.425 --> 00:34:55.662
What are you waitin' for?

597
00:34:57.429 --> 00:34:59.461
Steal the bastard back.

598
00:35:03.518 --> 00:35:05.102
I should warn you, that in addition

599
00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:06.520
to competing against each other

600
00:35:06.521 --> 00:35:09.398
for the top grade in this class,

601
00:35:09.399 --> 00:35:11.775
you will also be competing
for one of my firm's

602
00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:16.155
highly-coveted four
internship spots next year,

603
00:35:16.156 --> 00:35:19.992
where you will get to
assist on actual cases.

604
00:35:19.993 --> 00:35:22.276
Let the bloodbath begin.

605
00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:28.334
Now, let's commence
with our usual torture.

606
00:35:28.335 --> 00:35:29.535
Ms. Woods.

607
00:35:30.879 --> 00:35:32.171
Would you rather have a client

608
00:35:32.172 --> 00:35:36.912
who committed a crime malum
in se, or malum prohibitum?

609
00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:42.723
Neither.

610
00:35:42.724 --> 00:35:44.767
And why is that?

611
00:35:44.768 --> 00:35:46.925
I would rather have a
client who's innocent.

612
00:35:49.439 --> 00:35:51.847
Dare to dream, Ms. Woods.

613
00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:58.697
Ms. Kensington, which would you prefer?

614
00:35:58.698 --> 00:36:00.434
Malum prohibitum.

615
00:36:01.743 --> 00:36:03.327
Because then the client would've

616
00:36:03.328 --> 00:36:05.204
committed a regulatory infraction,

617
00:36:05.205 --> 00:36:07.915
as opposed to a dangerous crime.

618
00:36:07.916 --> 00:36:09.875
Well done, Ms. Kensington.

619
00:36:09.876 --> 00:36:13.003
You've obviously done your homework.

620
00:36:13.004 --> 00:36:17.549
Now, let us look at malum
prohibitum a little more closely.

621
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:19.218
It has been said.

622
00:36:19.219 --> 00:36:20.626
Yes, Ms. Woods?

623
00:36:21.471 --> 00:36:22.971
I changed my mind.

624
00:36:22.972 --> 00:36:24.807
I'd pick the dangerous one,

625
00:36:24.808 --> 00:36:27.045
'cause I'm not afraid of a challenge.

626
00:36:31.064 --> 00:36:32.523
Hike!

627
00:36:32.524 --> 00:36:33.524
Going inside.

628
00:36:33.525 --> 00:36:35.567
Right.
Come on guys, come on.

629
00:36:35.568 --> 00:36:36.402
Throw it, throw it,

630
00:36:36.403 --> 00:36:37.763
throw it, throw it.
Coming to ya.

631
00:36:39.322 --> 00:36:40.155
Pick it up.

632
00:36:40.156 --> 00:36:42.063
- Come on bro.
- Who is that?

633
00:36:46.287 --> 00:36:48.122
- Woo.
- Woo wee!

634
00:36:48.123 --> 00:36:49.156
Guys.

635
00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:52.459
- Hi!
- She needs some help

636
00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:53.377
with some sunscreen.

637
00:36:53.378 --> 00:36:55.194
Warner, do you know her?

638
00:36:57.257 --> 00:36:58.090
Hi.

639
00:36:58.091 --> 00:36:58.924
Look at that.

640
00:36:58.925 --> 00:37:00.467
Yeah.

641
00:37:00.468 --> 00:37:02.159
- Goodness.
- All right.

642
00:37:05.223 --> 00:37:06.098
Hi, everybody.

643
00:37:06.099 --> 00:37:07.850
Elle, what are you doing here?

644
00:37:07.851 --> 00:37:09.435
I've come to join your study group.

645
00:37:09.436 --> 00:37:10.853
And look, I brought sustenance.

646
00:37:10.854 --> 00:37:12.170
Who's first?

647
00:37:12.856 --> 00:37:14.513
Our group is full.

648
00:37:16.109 --> 00:37:18.110
Is this like an RSVP thing?

649
00:37:18.111 --> 00:37:20.946
No, it's like a smart-people thing.

650
00:37:20.947 --> 00:37:22.865
And, as Viv said, we're full.

651
00:37:22.866 --> 00:37:23.699
Come on, guys.

652
00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.062
We can make room for one more.

653
00:37:26.786 --> 00:37:30.414
We've already assigned the outlines.

654
00:37:30.415 --> 00:37:31.981
The answer is no.

655
00:37:40.216 --> 00:37:43.204
Okay, I'll just leave, then.

656
00:37:44.721 --> 00:37:45.921
Bye.

657
00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:53.020
Hey, maybe there's, like, a sorority

658
00:37:53.021 --> 00:37:55.439
you could, like, join instead, like.

659
00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.357
You know, if you had
come to a rush party,

660
00:37:57.358 --> 00:37:58.984
I would have at least been nice to you.

661
00:37:58.985 --> 00:38:01.195
Is that before you voted against me,

662
00:38:01.196 --> 00:38:03.781
and then called me a dyke behind my back?

663
00:38:03.782 --> 00:38:04.898
I don't use that word.

664
00:38:06.326 --> 00:38:09.394
You must have heard it from Vivian.

665
00:38:34.395 --> 00:38:35.395
Hello?

666
00:38:35.396 --> 00:38:36.897
Hey, it's me.

667
00:38:36.898 --> 00:38:38.440
It's Elle!

668
00:38:38.441 --> 00:38:40.567
Guess what I'm doing right this second?

669
00:38:40.568 --> 00:38:42.611
I don't know, what?

670
00:38:42.612 --> 00:38:45.572
I'm picking out my wedding dress!

671
00:38:45.573 --> 00:38:46.406
What?

672
00:38:46.407 --> 00:38:48.143
Josh proposed.

673
00:38:49.369 --> 00:38:52.079
Did you get the rock yet?

674
00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.316
Um, almost.

675
00:38:54.082 --> 00:38:56.208
Well, hurry up, so you can come home.

676
00:38:56.209 --> 00:38:57.626
We miss you.

677
00:38:57.627 --> 00:38:59.169
I miss you guys too.

678
00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.921
The people here are so vile.

679
00:39:00.922 --> 00:39:02.381
Hardly anybody speaks to me, unless...

680
00:39:02.382 --> 00:39:03.715
My God.

681
00:39:03.716 --> 00:39:05.509
I almost forgot to tell you.

682
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:06.385
What?

683
00:39:06.386 --> 00:39:08.178
I got bangs.

684
00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:09.179
My hair is so now.

685
00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.848
- Really?
- Yeah.

686
00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:12.808
Okay, so just listen to me.

687
00:39:12.809 --> 00:39:14.184
Keep June 1st open.

688
00:39:14.185 --> 00:39:15.936
You're one of my bridesmaids.

689
00:39:15.937 --> 00:39:18.230
And give Warner our love.

690
00:39:18.231 --> 00:39:20.190
Because I'm getting married!

691
00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:22.383
I'm getting!

692
00:39:30.451 --> 00:39:31.702
So don't forget.

693
00:39:31.703 --> 00:39:34.246
Eight o'clock at 45 Dunstan Street.

694
00:39:34.247 --> 00:39:36.415
It'll be a really nice party.
Okay we'll be there.

695
00:39:36.416 --> 00:39:39.501
And don't forget
to bring your own Merlot.

696
00:39:39.502 --> 00:39:40.544
- Okay.
- No way!

697
00:39:40.545 --> 00:39:44.131
Is somebody at this school
actually having a party?

698
00:39:44.132 --> 00:39:45.332
Yes.

699
00:39:47.343 --> 00:39:48.719
But it's a costume party.

700
00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.628
You probably wouldn't wanna come.

701
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:54.474
I love costume parties.

702
00:39:54.475 --> 00:39:58.464
Well, then, I guess
we'll see you there.

703
00:39:59.439 --> 00:40:00.639
Okay.

704
00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.234
At 45 Dunstan Street.

705
00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:05.471
Okay.

706
00:40:23.963 --> 00:40:25.163
My God!

707
00:40:43.733 --> 00:40:44.983
Thanks for inviting me, girls.

708
00:40:44.984 --> 00:40:46.944
This party is super fun.

709
00:40:46.945 --> 00:40:49.947
Nice outfit.

710
00:40:49.948 --> 00:40:51.698
I like your outfit, too.

711
00:40:51.699 --> 00:40:53.700
Except when I dress up as a frigid bitch,

712
00:40:53.701 --> 00:40:56.188
I try not to look so constipated.

713
00:41:00.208 --> 00:41:02.115
She's horrible.

714
00:41:02.919 --> 00:41:05.657
You've got the ring, sweetie.

715
00:41:09.092 --> 00:41:10.050
- Nice ears.
- How you doin'?

716
00:41:10.051 --> 00:41:11.218
Warner, Warner!

717
00:41:11.219 --> 00:41:14.346
The English language it is all
about subliminal domination.

718
00:41:14.347 --> 00:41:16.473
I mean, take the word, semester, okay?

719
00:41:16.474 --> 00:41:19.017
This is a perfect example of
this school's discriminatory

720
00:41:19.018 --> 00:41:20.477
preference of semen to ovaries.

721
00:41:20.478 --> 00:41:22.396
That's why I'm petitioning
to have next term

722
00:41:22.397 --> 00:41:25.023
be referred to as the winter ovester.

723
00:41:25.024 --> 00:41:27.317
Excuse me, hey, Warner.

724
00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:30.737
Well, don't you
look like a walking felony?

725
00:41:30.738 --> 00:41:32.395
Thank you, you're so sweet.

726
00:41:33.533 --> 00:41:35.409
Are you having fun?

727
00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:36.284
I am now.

728
00:41:36.285 --> 00:41:38.870
What, what's with the costume?

729
00:41:38.871 --> 00:41:41.164
I just decided to dress up.

730
00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:42.457
Really?

731
00:41:42.458 --> 00:41:43.792
You know, I feel like we barely get to

732
00:41:43.793 --> 00:41:45.627
see each other since we've been here.

733
00:41:45.628 --> 00:41:46.670
I know,

734
00:41:46.671 --> 00:41:49.047
I'm so busy with these
case studies and hypos.

735
00:41:49.048 --> 00:41:49.923
I know what you mean.

736
00:41:49.924 --> 00:41:51.091
I can't imagine doing all this

737
00:41:51.092 --> 00:41:53.468
and Callahan's internship next year.

738
00:41:53.469 --> 00:41:55.470
This is gonna be so much.

739
00:41:55.471 --> 00:41:56.972
Elle.

740
00:41:56.973 --> 00:41:58.098
Come on, you're never gonna get the grades

741
00:41:58.099 --> 00:42:01.143
to qualify for one of those spots.

742
00:42:01.144 --> 00:42:04.052
You're not smart enough, sweetie.

743
00:42:04.981 --> 00:42:06.106
Wait, am I on glue,

744
00:42:06.107 --> 00:42:08.942
or did we not get into the
same law school, Warner?

745
00:42:08.943 --> 00:42:10.152
Well, yeah, but...

746
00:42:10.153 --> 00:42:11.111
But what?

747
00:42:11.112 --> 00:42:12.612
We took the same LSATs,

748
00:42:12.613 --> 00:42:14.865
and we're taking the same classes.

749
00:42:14.866 --> 00:42:15.699
I know.

750
00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:18.952
But come on, Elle, be serious.

751
00:42:18.953 --> 00:42:21.145
You can do something more
valuable with your time.

752
00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:29.529
I'm never gonna be good
enough for you, am I?

753
00:42:33.926 --> 00:42:34.885
Elle, come on.

754
00:42:34.886 --> 00:42:35.961
Just forget it.

755
00:42:39.015 --> 00:42:42.458
I'll show you how valuable
Elle Woods can be.

756
00:42:54.363 --> 00:42:55.989
Don't ask.

757
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:57.148
Wasn't gonna.

758
00:43:07.794 --> 00:43:10.281
I love that sweater, it's Chanel.

759
00:43:11.923 --> 00:43:13.409
Look.

760
00:43:14.175 --> 00:43:15.786
Is she carrying books?

761
00:43:26.938 --> 00:43:29.676
So, you've filed a claim.

762
00:43:31.025 --> 00:43:32.225
What next?

763
00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:35.270
Ms. Woods?

764
00:43:37.782 --> 00:43:40.242
Don't you need to have evidence?

765
00:43:40.243 --> 00:43:41.993
Meaning?

766
00:43:41.994 --> 00:43:45.038
Meaning you need reasonable belief

767
00:43:45.039 --> 00:43:49.734
that your claim should have,
like, evidentiary support?

768
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:55.590
And what kind of evidentiary support

769
00:43:55.591 --> 00:43:57.373
does this case require?

770
00:44:07.895 --> 00:44:08.928
With us Mark Jacobson

771
00:44:10.565 --> 00:44:11.481
It won't take long
In the article you talk

772
00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:13.548
about all sort of things,

773
00:44:26.664 --> 00:44:29.197
And the purpose of
diminished capacity is?

774
00:44:32.128 --> 00:44:34.160
To negate mens rea?

775
00:44:53.274 --> 00:44:54.840
Are you ready?

776
00:44:56.861 --> 00:44:57.694
No.

777
00:44:57.695 --> 00:44:59.738
Yes, yes, you are.

778
00:44:59.739 --> 00:45:01.555
Go, you can do this.

779
00:45:04.744 --> 00:45:05.911
Listen to me, Dewey.

780
00:45:05.912 --> 00:45:07.728
You shut your mouth.

781
00:45:08.789 --> 00:45:11.276
No, you shut your big mouth.

782
00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:14.743
I'm doing all the talking.

783
00:45:24.847 --> 00:45:26.890
What the hell do you want?

784
00:45:26.891 --> 00:45:28.433
We're eatin' lunch.

785
00:45:28.434 --> 00:45:30.977
I just thought that maybe I could...

786
00:45:30.978 --> 00:45:33.688
You just thought you could come here

787
00:45:33.689 --> 00:45:37.901
and show me what I'm definitely
not missin'?

788
00:45:37.902 --> 00:45:39.986
That's not why I came by.

789
00:45:39.987 --> 00:45:41.196
Hey, Paulette, how many times you gonna

790
00:45:41.197 --> 00:45:44.074
come over here beggin'
me to take you back?

791
00:45:44.075 --> 00:45:45.482
I was, um, I.

792
00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:49.246
Dewey Newcombe?

793
00:45:49.247 --> 00:45:50.654
Who's askin'?

794
00:45:51.457 --> 00:45:52.707
I'm Elle Woods,

795
00:45:52.708 --> 00:45:55.252
Ms. Bonifante's attorney.

796
00:45:55.253 --> 00:45:58.672
And I'm here to discuss the
legal situation at hand.

797
00:45:58.673 --> 00:46:00.006
Come again?

798
00:46:00.007 --> 00:46:03.551
Do you understand what
subject matter jurisdiction is?

799
00:46:03.552 --> 00:46:04.386
No.

800
00:46:04.387 --> 00:46:05.887
Yeah, I didn't think so.

801
00:46:05.888 --> 00:46:08.296
Well, due to habeas corpus,

802
00:46:09.558 --> 00:46:12.894
you and Ms. Bonifante had
a common law marriage,

803
00:46:12.895 --> 00:46:15.981
which, heretofore, entitles her

804
00:46:15.982 --> 00:46:17.399
to what is legally referred to

805
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.559
as equitable division of the assets.

806
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:22.904
Come again?

807
00:46:22.905 --> 00:46:27.575
Due to the fact that you've
retained this residence

808
00:46:27.576 --> 00:46:28.910
Ms. Bonifante is entitled

809
00:46:28.911 --> 00:46:31.288
to full canine property ownership,

810
00:46:31.289 --> 00:46:35.358
and will be enforcing
said ownership right now.

811
00:46:38.129 --> 00:46:40.036
Tell him, Paulette.

812
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:48.169
I'm takin' the dog, dumb-ass!

813
00:46:49.515 --> 00:46:53.425
We did it!

814
00:46:55.813 --> 00:46:58.315
Come here.

815
00:46:58.316 --> 00:46:59.482
My gosh, did you see him?

816
00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:01.192
He's probably still scratching his head.

817
00:47:01.193 --> 00:47:04.227
Yeah, which must be a
nice vacation for his balls.

818
00:47:14.206 --> 00:47:15.406
Thank you.

819
00:47:21.422 --> 00:47:23.757
Well according to
Swinney versus Newbert,

820
00:47:23.758 --> 00:47:25.592
Swinney, who was also
a private sperm donor,

821
00:47:25.593 --> 00:47:26.801
was allowed visitation rights

822
00:47:26.802 --> 00:47:28.470
as long as he came to terms

823
00:47:28.471 --> 00:47:30.430
with the hours set forth by the parents.

824
00:47:30.431 --> 00:47:32.891
So, if we're sticking to past precedent,

825
00:47:32.892 --> 00:47:35.977
I mean, Mr. Latimer wasn't stalking.

826
00:47:35.978 --> 00:47:39.314
He was clearly within his
rights to ask for visitation.

827
00:47:39.315 --> 00:47:42.776
But Swinney was a one-time sperm donor.

828
00:47:42.777 --> 00:47:46.237
And, in our case, the defendant
was an habitual sperm donor,

829
00:47:46.238 --> 00:47:48.406
who also happens to be harassing

830
00:47:48.407 --> 00:47:50.283
the parents in his quest for visitation.

831
00:47:50.284 --> 00:47:53.328
Well, yeah, but I mean,
without this man's sperm

832
00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:56.664
the child in question wouldn't exist.

833
00:47:56.665 --> 00:47:59.608
Now you're thinking like a lawyer.

834
00:48:03.464 --> 00:48:05.590
Yes, Ms. Woods?

835
00:48:05.591 --> 00:48:08.551
Although Mr. Huntington
makes an excellent point,

836
00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:11.137
I have to wonder if the
defendant kept a thorough record

837
00:48:11.138 --> 00:48:14.331
of every sperm emission
made throughout his life.

838
00:48:17.061 --> 00:48:17.894
Interesting.

839
00:48:17.895 --> 00:48:19.354
Why do you ask?

840
00:48:19.355 --> 00:48:22.107
Well, unless the defendant attempted

841
00:48:22.108 --> 00:48:24.275
to contact every single one-night stand

842
00:48:24.276 --> 00:48:27.195
to determine if a child
resulted in those unions,

843
00:48:27.196 --> 00:48:29.948
he has no parental claim
over this child, whatsoever.

844
00:48:29.949 --> 00:48:30.782
Why now?

845
00:48:30.783 --> 00:48:32.190
Why this sperm?

846
00:48:34.286 --> 00:48:35.578
I see your point.

847
00:48:35.579 --> 00:48:37.122
And for that matter,

848
00:48:37.123 --> 00:48:39.082
all masturbatory emissions where his sperm

849
00:48:39.083 --> 00:48:40.250
was clearly not seeking an egg,

850
00:48:40.251 --> 00:48:43.489
could be termed reckless abandonment.

851
00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:47.744
I believe you've just won your case.

852
00:48:51.429 --> 00:48:53.513
Ms. Woods, you did well today.

853
00:48:53.514 --> 00:48:54.714
Really?

854
00:48:55.474 --> 00:48:58.184
You're applying for my
internship, aren't you?

855
00:48:58.185 --> 00:48:59.269
I don't know.

856
00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:00.103
Well, you should.

857
00:49:00.104 --> 00:49:02.105
Do you have a resume?

858
00:49:02.106 --> 00:49:03.690
Yes, I do.

859
00:49:03.691 --> 00:49:04.891
Um.

860
00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:09.020
Here it is.

861
00:49:10.823 --> 00:49:11.781
It's pink.

862
00:49:11.782 --> 00:49:12.991
And it's scented.

863
00:49:12.992 --> 00:49:14.534
I think it gives it a
little something extra,

864
00:49:14.535 --> 00:49:16.021
don't you think?

865
00:49:18.122 --> 00:49:20.609
Okay, well, see you next class.

866
00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:26.963
Do you think she woke
up one morning and said,

867
00:49:26.964 --> 00:49:29.257
I think I'll go to law school today?

868
00:49:29.258 --> 00:49:31.342
Well, that lapse in judgment aside,

869
00:49:31.343 --> 00:49:34.012
I think she's got a lot of potential.

870
00:49:34.013 --> 00:49:36.347
Here's the Windham file.

871
00:49:36.348 --> 00:49:39.336
Smell this.

872
00:49:40.561 --> 00:49:41.811
What's that?

873
00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:44.022
It's her resume.

874
00:49:44.023 --> 00:49:45.589
It smells good.

875
00:50:09.965 --> 00:50:11.466
What's going on?

876
00:50:11.467 --> 00:50:13.676
Callahan's firm is
defending a murder trial.

877
00:50:13.677 --> 00:50:15.094
His case load is so big,

878
00:50:15.095 --> 00:50:17.472
he's taking on first-year interns.

879
00:50:17.473 --> 00:50:18.556
He picked 'em already?

880
00:50:18.557 --> 00:50:19.390
My God,

881
00:50:19.391 --> 00:50:21.684
I can't believe it, Warner!

882
00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:23.342
We got it!
Yes.

883
00:50:25.022 --> 00:50:28.841
That only leaves one for.

884
00:50:32.988 --> 00:50:34.188
Me!

885
00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:36.190
Yes!

886
00:50:41.163 --> 00:50:42.363
Warner.

887
00:50:47.127 --> 00:50:49.921
Do you remember when we spent
those four amazing hours

888
00:50:49.922 --> 00:50:52.674
in the hot tub after Winter Formal?

889
00:50:52.675 --> 00:50:55.510
Yeah, no.

890
00:50:55.511 --> 00:50:59.055
This is so much better than that!

891
00:50:59.056 --> 00:50:59.889
Excuse me.

892
00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:02.298
I have some shopping to do.

893
00:51:03.227 --> 00:51:04.463
Four hours?

894
00:51:26.292 --> 00:51:29.669
You look very nice today, Vivian.

895
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:31.337
Thank you.

896
00:51:31.338 --> 00:51:33.245
You're welcome.

897
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.184
We're defending Brooke Windham,

898
00:51:45.185 --> 00:51:46.519
whose very wealthy husband

899
00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:49.188
was found shot to death in
their Beacon Hill mansion.

900
00:51:49.189 --> 00:51:50.398
Gold-digger?

901
00:51:50.399 --> 00:51:52.525
You'd think so, since the stiff was 60,

902
00:51:52.526 --> 00:51:54.485
but she was rich on her own.

903
00:51:54.486 --> 00:51:56.237
Some kind of fitness empire.

904
00:51:56.238 --> 00:51:59.157
You can buy her exercise
tapes on infomercials.

905
00:51:59.158 --> 00:52:02.910
Wait, are you talking
about Brooke Taylor?

906
00:52:02.911 --> 00:52:05.496
Maiden name, Taylor.

907
00:52:05.497 --> 00:52:06.497
You know her?

908
00:52:06.498 --> 00:52:08.249
She's a Delta Nu.

909
00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:09.292
She wasn't in my pledge class.

910
00:52:09.293 --> 00:52:11.794
She graduated four years before me.

911
00:52:11.795 --> 00:52:12.920
But I used to take her class

912
00:52:12.921 --> 00:52:14.464
at the Los Angeles Sports Club.

913
00:52:14.465 --> 00:52:15.781
She's amazing.

914
00:52:16.508 --> 00:52:18.259
Amazing, how?

915
00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:20.762
She can make you lose like
three pounds in one class.

916
00:52:20.763 --> 00:52:22.513
She's completely gifted.

917
00:52:22.514 --> 00:52:23.431
Well, in all likelihood,

918
00:52:23.432 --> 00:52:25.600
she's completely guilty as well.

919
00:52:25.601 --> 00:52:28.394
She was seen standing
over her husbands body.

920
00:52:28.395 --> 00:52:29.812
By who?

921
00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:33.441
His 26-year-old
daughter and the pool boy.

922
00:52:33.442 --> 00:52:35.985
Sorry I'm late, excuse me.

923
00:52:35.986 --> 00:52:37.862
This is Emmett Richmond, an associate.

924
00:52:37.863 --> 00:52:39.155
Top three in his class

925
00:52:39.156 --> 00:52:42.033
and former editor of Harvard Law Review.

926
00:52:42.034 --> 00:52:43.034
You've probably seen him lurking

927
00:52:43.035 --> 00:52:45.119
around campus doing my research.

928
00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.121
Thanks for the introduction.

929
00:52:47.122 --> 00:52:49.332
So, what
about the murder weapon?

930
00:52:49.333 --> 00:52:50.708
The gun is missing.

931
00:52:50.709 --> 00:52:53.419
Coroner said he'd been dead 30
minutes when the cops arrived

932
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:55.672
giving Brooke plenty of time to stash it.

933
00:52:55.673 --> 00:52:58.383
I just don't think Brooke
could have done this.

934
00:52:58.384 --> 00:53:00.343
Exercise gives you endorphins.

935
00:53:00.344 --> 00:53:01.844
Endorphins make you happy.

936
00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:06.432
Happy people just don't
shoot their husbands.

937
00:53:06.433 --> 00:53:08.559
They just don't.

938
00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:10.520
I didn't do it.

939
00:53:10.521 --> 00:53:11.854
I walked in.

940
00:53:11.855 --> 00:53:14.482
I saw my husband lying on the floor.

941
00:53:14.483 --> 00:53:15.775
I bent down to check his heart,

942
00:53:15.776 --> 00:53:16.651
screamed my head off,

943
00:53:16.652 --> 00:53:18.361
and then Enrique and Chutney ran inside.

944
00:53:18.362 --> 00:53:19.487
Okay, your stepdaughter

945
00:53:19.488 --> 00:53:21.030
and the pool boy came in,

946
00:53:21.031 --> 00:53:21.906
where they saw you standing

947
00:53:21.907 --> 00:53:25.066
over the body, covered in his blood.

948
00:53:27.621 --> 00:53:29.205
Why would I kill my husband?

949
00:53:29.206 --> 00:53:30.081
Insurance?

950
00:53:30.082 --> 00:53:31.124
A love affair?

951
00:53:31.125 --> 00:53:32.750
Pure unadulterated hatred?

952
00:53:32.751 --> 00:53:35.628
Believe me, the DA will come
up with plenty of reasons.

953
00:53:35.629 --> 00:53:36.945
I loved him.

954
00:53:38.257 --> 00:53:41.175
He was 34 years older than you.

955
00:53:41.176 --> 00:53:44.137
That doesn't look so good to a jury.

956
00:53:44.138 --> 00:53:46.889
Then show them a picture of his dick.

957
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:49.798
That might clear a few things up.

958
00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.688
Brooke, I believe you.

959
00:53:53.689 --> 00:53:57.233
But a jury is gonna want an alibi.

960
00:53:57.234 --> 00:53:58.985
Well, I can't give you that.

961
00:53:58.986 --> 00:54:02.739
And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.

962
00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:03.865
Well, then,

963
00:54:03.866 --> 00:54:06.149
I guess we're done for today.

964
00:54:14.918 --> 00:54:16.252
- Hey.
- Hi.

965
00:54:16.253 --> 00:54:17.378
I know you.

966
00:54:17.379 --> 00:54:18.504
I'm a Delta Nu.

967
00:54:18.505 --> 00:54:21.090
And I'm a huge fan of yours.

968
00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:22.577
You took my class in LA.

969
00:54:23.469 --> 00:54:26.512
You had the best high
kick I've ever seen.

970
00:54:26.513 --> 00:54:28.347
Are you one of my lawyers?

971
00:54:28.348 --> 00:54:30.308
Yeah, sort of.

972
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:32.602
Well, thank God one of you has a brain.

973
00:54:32.603 --> 00:54:34.339
Let's go.

974
00:54:38.275 --> 00:54:39.692
I'm the only one that believes her.

975
00:54:39.693 --> 00:54:41.652
Callahan totally thinks she's guilty.

976
00:54:41.653 --> 00:54:45.698
Yeah, that's 'cause men are
big fat retards who don't...

977
00:54:45.699 --> 00:54:47.241
Afternoon, ladies.

978
00:54:47.242 --> 00:54:48.201
Hey, how's it going?

979
00:54:48.202 --> 00:54:49.911
It's him.

980
00:54:49.912 --> 00:54:51.853
Paulette Bonifante.

981
00:54:52.664 --> 00:54:53.698
My God.

982
00:54:56.293 --> 00:54:58.325
He's coming over here.

983
00:55:01.715 --> 00:55:05.033
I've got a package.

984
00:55:06.595 --> 00:55:08.832
He's got a package.

985
00:55:21.527 --> 00:55:23.361
How you doin' today?

986
00:55:23.362 --> 00:55:24.395
Fine.

987
00:55:30.786 --> 00:55:32.193
Take it easy.

988
00:55:33.622 --> 00:55:34.747
See you later.

989
00:55:34.748 --> 00:55:36.155
Take it easy.

990
00:55:37.042 --> 00:55:38.292
That's great, Paulette.

991
00:55:38.293 --> 00:55:40.670
Is this the only interaction
you two have ever had?

992
00:55:40.671 --> 00:55:42.088
No!

993
00:55:42.089 --> 00:55:46.676
Sometimes I say, okay,
instead of fine.

994
00:55:46.677 --> 00:55:48.511
Why don't you offer him a cold beverage,

995
00:55:48.512 --> 00:55:51.013
or a neck massage, or something?

996
00:55:51.014 --> 00:55:52.807
Come on, what's the point?

997
00:55:52.808 --> 00:55:55.560
Trust me, Paulette, you
have all the equipment.

998
00:55:55.561 --> 00:55:57.002
You just need to read the manual.

999
00:55:58.397 --> 00:56:00.008
Do you know what I'm saying?

1000
00:56:01.483 --> 00:56:02.817
Okay, I'm gonna show a little maneuver

1001
00:56:02.818 --> 00:56:04.694
that my mother taught me in junior high.

1002
00:56:04.695 --> 00:56:07.530
In my experience, it
has a 98% success rate

1003
00:56:07.531 --> 00:56:08.865
of getting a man's attention

1004
00:56:08.866 --> 00:56:10.992
and, when used appropriately,

1005
00:56:10.993 --> 00:56:12.368
it has an 83% rate

1006
00:56:12.369 --> 00:56:14.401
of return on a dinner invitation.

1007
00:56:15.914 --> 00:56:18.708
It's called the bend and snap.

1008
00:56:18.709 --> 00:56:19.909
Watch this.

1009
00:56:22.462 --> 00:56:24.130
I think I dropped something

1010
00:56:24.131 --> 00:56:26.173
on the floor that I need to pick up.

1011
00:56:26.174 --> 00:56:27.865
So you bend

1012
00:56:28.719 --> 00:56:30.303
and snap.

1013
00:56:30.304 --> 00:56:31.512
See?

1014
00:56:31.513 --> 00:56:33.079
Come on, you try.

1015
00:56:37.311 --> 00:56:38.797
Bend and snap.

1016
00:56:40.272 --> 00:56:42.148
Okay, um, yeah.

1017
00:56:42.149 --> 00:56:44.734
A little less bend, a little more snap.

1018
00:56:44.735 --> 00:56:45.568
Okay?

1019
00:56:45.569 --> 00:56:46.903
Like this?

1020
00:56:46.904 --> 00:56:48.779
Good snap!

1021
00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:49.980
Come on.

1022
00:56:51.366 --> 00:56:52.742
You!

1023
00:56:52.743 --> 00:56:54.869
Come on, you can do it.

1024
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:56.356
Bend and snap.

1025
00:56:57.205 --> 00:56:58.239
My goodness.

1026
00:57:00.334 --> 00:57:01.459
We can all do it.

1027
00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:02.493
Come on, guys!

1028
00:57:04.755 --> 00:57:07.465
You're gonna bend and snap.

1029
00:57:07.466 --> 00:57:08.841
Now put your head into it.

1030
00:57:08.842 --> 00:57:11.969
Bend and snap.
Go on over and try it.

1031
00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:13.456
Bend and snap.

1032
00:57:14.765 --> 00:57:15.973
Good job!

1033
00:57:15.974 --> 00:57:18.267
A little attitude, please.

1034
00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:19.477
Now, everybody, smile.

1035
00:57:19.478 --> 00:57:21.437
That's very important.

1036
00:57:21.438 --> 00:57:22.396
Pump!

1037
00:57:22.397 --> 00:57:23.648
Pump, pump!

1038
00:57:23.649 --> 00:57:24.965
Bend and snap.

1039
00:57:26.026 --> 00:57:27.842
Good job, everybody.

1040
00:57:30.030 --> 00:57:31.266
Work it out!

1041
00:57:35.535 --> 00:57:37.351
- Come on, Paulette.
- Yeah!

1042
00:57:38.413 --> 00:57:41.082
- Bend and snap.
- Yes!

1043
00:57:41.083 --> 00:57:42.124
My God.

1044
00:57:42.125 --> 00:57:43.668
The bend and snap.

1045
00:57:43.669 --> 00:57:45.610
Works every time.

1046
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:50.341
Well, if Brooke didn't
kill the guy, then who did?

1047
00:57:50.342 --> 00:57:52.843
My money is on the angry
daughter or the ex-wife.

1048
00:57:52.844 --> 00:57:54.261
Chutney has a trust fund.

1049
00:57:54.262 --> 00:57:56.681
She didn't need the insurance
payoff or the inheritance.

1050
00:57:56.682 --> 00:57:57.932
What about the mother?

1051
00:57:57.933 --> 00:57:59.392
Covered, she was in Aspen at the time.

1052
00:57:59.393 --> 00:58:01.018
Vivian, get me some plum sauce.

1053
00:58:01.019 --> 00:58:02.478
Ten people saw her downing

1054
00:58:02.479 --> 00:58:04.730
cosmopolitans at the Caribou Club.

1055
00:58:04.731 --> 00:58:07.024
Well all I know is that it's not Brooke.

1056
00:58:07.025 --> 00:58:11.014
That's touching, Elle,
but we need an alibi.

1057
00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:14.532
I brought you some necessities.

1058
00:58:14.533 --> 00:58:17.660
Some Calvin Klein 720-count sheets,

1059
00:58:17.661 --> 00:58:19.912
the entire Clinique skincare line,

1060
00:58:19.913 --> 00:58:23.572
some aromatherapy candles, a loofah.

1061
00:58:24.918 --> 00:58:26.234
And the Bible.

1062
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:30.256
You're an angel.

1063
00:58:30.257 --> 00:58:31.382
So how are you?

1064
00:58:31.383 --> 00:58:32.758
Are you all right?

1065
00:58:32.759 --> 00:58:34.495
You look so orange.

1066
00:58:35.846 --> 00:58:39.473
I'm just glad that
it's you and not Callahan.

1067
00:58:39.474 --> 00:58:40.766
He means well.

1068
00:58:40.767 --> 00:58:41.767
He's very brilliant.

1069
00:58:41.768 --> 00:58:45.604
He better be, for
what I'm paying for him.

1070
00:58:45.605 --> 00:58:47.898
I have to tell you the
real reason I came here.

1071
00:58:47.899 --> 00:58:48.941
Professor Callahan says

1072
00:58:48.942 --> 00:58:51.736
we really, really need your alibi.

1073
00:58:51.737 --> 00:58:53.223
Elle, I can't.

1074
00:58:55.866 --> 00:58:57.533
I mean, you don't understand.

1075
00:58:57.534 --> 00:59:01.245
Who could understand better than me?

1076
00:59:01.246 --> 00:59:02.997
It's so shameful.

1077
00:59:02.998 --> 00:59:05.458
Whatever it is, Brooke,
it could save you.

1078
00:59:05.459 --> 00:59:06.709
No, that's just it.

1079
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:08.276
It would ruin me.

1080
00:59:09.004 --> 00:59:10.204
How?

1081
00:59:13.341 --> 00:59:15.301
I've made my fortune on the ability

1082
00:59:15.302 --> 00:59:16.677
to perfect women's bodies

1083
00:59:16.678 --> 00:59:18.471
with Brooke's butt-buster workout.

1084
00:59:18.472 --> 00:59:20.473
I know, you helped me
go from a six to a four.

1085
00:59:20.474 --> 00:59:21.881
That's great!

1086
00:59:25.854 --> 00:59:29.388
On the day of Heyworth's murder.

1087
00:59:36.782 --> 00:59:38.199
What?

1088
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:41.393
I was getting liposuction.

1089
00:59:42.037 --> 00:59:43.444
Liposuction!

1090
00:59:44.206 --> 00:59:45.247
God!

1091
00:59:45.248 --> 00:59:46.123
No!

1092
00:59:46.124 --> 00:59:47.833
I know, I'm a fraud!

1093
00:59:47.834 --> 00:59:50.920
But it's not like normal
women can have this ass!

1094
00:59:50.921 --> 00:59:52.379
If my fans knew that I bought it,

1095
00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:54.537
I would lose everything.

1096
00:59:56.051 --> 00:59:58.584
I've already lost my husband.

1097
01:00:01.473 --> 01:00:05.726
I'd rather go to jail
than lose my reputation.

1098
01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:08.965
Brooke, your secret's safe with me.

1099
01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:14.601
Thank you.

1100
01:00:16.905 --> 01:00:19.281
Vivian, grab me some coffee.

1101
01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:20.366
We got two interviews tomorrow

1102
01:00:20.367 --> 01:00:22.284
that Gerard and Bobby are gonna handle,

1103
01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:23.410
and the ex-wife in an hour.

1104
01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:26.330
According to this
communique from the prison,

1105
01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:29.959
our client apparently had
a visit from her sister.

1106
01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.446
A Miss Delta Nu.

1107
01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:36.465
Anyone you know?

1108
01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:38.676
Yes, I went to visit her.

1109
01:00:38.677 --> 01:00:40.344
What the hell do you
mean, you went to visit her?

1110
01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:41.762
I went to get her alibi.

1111
01:00:41.763 --> 01:00:43.374
Did you get it?

1112
01:00:44.141 --> 01:00:45.558
It's really good.

1113
01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:46.976
Well, great.

1114
01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:48.060
What is it?

1115
01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:50.646
I can't tell you.

1116
01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:51.689
Why the hell not?

1117
01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:53.858
Because I promised her
I'd keep it a secret.

1118
01:00:53.859 --> 01:00:56.026
And I can't break the bonds of sisterhood.

1119
01:00:56.027 --> 01:00:57.403
Screw Sisterhood!

1120
01:00:57.404 --> 01:00:58.362
This is a murder trial,

1121
01:00:58.363 --> 01:01:00.573
not some scandal at the sorority house.

1122
01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:02.616
I want the alibi.

1123
01:01:02.617 --> 01:01:04.160
I can't give it to you.

1124
01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:07.371
But I can tell you she is innocent.

1125
01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:08.330
Mr. Callahan,

1126
01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:10.958
Mrs. Windham Vandermark
is on line two for you.

1127
01:01:10.959 --> 01:01:14.778
Someone reason with
her while I take this.

1128
01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:16.422
Are you crazy?

1129
01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:18.174
Just tell him the alibi.

1130
01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:19.008
No!

1131
01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:20.176
We're gonna lose the case if you don't.

1132
01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:22.136
Well then we're not very good lawyers.

1133
01:01:22.137 --> 01:01:22.970
If you tell him,

1134
01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:25.639
he'll probably hire you
as a summer associate.

1135
01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.932
Who cares about Brooke?

1136
01:01:26.933 --> 01:01:28.840
Think about yourself.

1137
01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:32.354
I gave her my word, Warner.

1138
01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:33.555
So what?

1139
01:01:37.986 --> 01:01:39.737
The ex-wife seems to be unconcerned

1140
01:01:39.738 --> 01:01:41.906
with the fact that her interview is today.

1141
01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:43.908
She's at a spa in the Berkshires.

1142
01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:44.867
A spa.

1143
01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:47.912
Isn't that kind of like your mothership?

1144
01:01:47.913 --> 01:01:49.413
I could go if you want me to.

1145
01:01:49.414 --> 01:01:50.247
Emmett.

1146
01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:51.207
Yeah?

1147
01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:52.416
Go with her.

1148
01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:53.617
Okay.

1149
01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:06.639
She seems completely
untrustworthy to me.

1150
01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.848
Why?

1151
01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:10.142
I mean, this is a person
who's made her living

1152
01:02:10.143 --> 01:02:12.353
by telling women they're too fat.

1153
01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:14.647
Brooke would never tell a
woman that she was too fat.

1154
01:02:14.648 --> 01:02:18.234
And she seems to me like
she's hiding something.

1155
01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:19.610
Then maybe it's not what you think.

1156
01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:23.197
Maybe it's exactly what I think.

1157
01:02:23.198 --> 01:02:25.741
You know, you're
really being a butthead.

1158
01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:27.117
A butthead?

1159
01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:28.661
Why would you call me that?

1160
01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:29.536
You know, Emmett,

1161
01:02:29.537 --> 01:02:30.955
you just need to have a
little more faith in people.

1162
01:02:30.956 --> 01:02:32.988
You might be surprised.

1163
01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:36.418
I can't believe you
just called me a butthead.

1164
01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:37.503
I mean, no ones' called me a butthead

1165
01:02:37.504 --> 01:02:39.213
since about the ninth grade.

1166
01:02:39.214 --> 01:02:43.374
Maybe not to your face.

1167
01:02:44.803 --> 01:02:47.638
So this is what
a spa looks like.

1168
01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:48.847
How do we find her?

1169
01:02:48.848 --> 01:02:49.682
I called ahead.

1170
01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:50.599
She's in the mud room.

1171
01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.668
She's not naked, is she?

1172
01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:58.256
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?

1173
01:03:00.193 --> 01:03:01.759
So, you found me.

1174
01:03:02.487 --> 01:03:03.737
Yes.

1175
01:03:03.738 --> 01:03:05.906
We're from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Callahan

1176
01:03:05.907 --> 01:03:08.993
and we're here to ask you a few questions.

1177
01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:10.828
So, I hear that that little tart

1178
01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:13.455
from California shot poor Heyworth.

1179
01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:14.957
Well, that's what we're trying to prove

1180
01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:16.208
didn't happen, actually.

1181
01:03:16.209 --> 01:03:18.669
Do you have any reason
to believe that it did?

1182
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:21.505
Well, I've never actually met the woman.

1183
01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:22.339
But my daughter tells me

1184
01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:25.134
she can be quite the little bitch.

1185
01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:27.803
Now, did your daughter
ever mention anything to you

1186
01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:31.390
about the relationship
between Brooke and Heyworth?

1187
01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:35.936
Well, she did say that
they humped like gorillas.

1188
01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:39.106
I guess it wasn't enough,
though, for Brooke.

1189
01:03:39.107 --> 01:03:41.066
Why do you say that?

1190
01:03:41.067 --> 01:03:43.110
Well,

1191
01:03:43.111 --> 01:03:45.928
haven't you seen the cabana boy?

1192
01:03:47.407 --> 01:03:48.824
She's lying.

1193
01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:50.701
And you know this for a fact?

1194
01:03:50.702 --> 01:03:52.911
Did you see the icky
brown color of her hair?

1195
01:03:52.912 --> 01:03:53.829
So?

1196
01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:56.123
Now you discriminate against brunettes?

1197
01:03:56.124 --> 01:03:56.999
Why shouldn't I?

1198
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.542
I'm discriminated against as a blonde.

1199
01:03:58.543 --> 01:03:59.585
You know, being a blonde

1200
01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:01.128
is actually a pretty powerful thing.

1201
01:04:01.129 --> 01:04:02.921
You hold more cards than you think you do.

1202
01:04:02.922 --> 01:04:06.258
I personally would like
to see you take that power

1203
01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:10.262
and channel it towards the
greater good, you know?

1204
01:04:10.263 --> 01:04:12.431
Thanks, I'll see you tomorrow.

1205
01:04:12.432 --> 01:04:14.183
All right.

1206
01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:15.384
Hey.

1207
01:04:15.935 --> 01:04:16.769
Yeah?

1208
01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:18.312
How do you think
I'd look as a blond, you know?

1209
01:04:18.313 --> 01:04:21.940
I'm not sure you could handle it.

1210
01:04:21.941 --> 01:04:23.177
- Bye.
- Bye.

1211
01:04:32.827 --> 01:04:34.620
So I called
your room last night.

1212
01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:35.746
I heard.

1213
01:04:35.747 --> 01:04:38.040
I was thinking maybe
we could go out sometime.

1214
01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:40.709
No, you're a dork.

1215
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:43.045
I'm in law school.

1216
01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:44.922
Look, I'm not
gonna go out with you.

1217
01:04:44.923 --> 01:04:47.216
I can't believe you'd even ask.

1218
01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:50.636
Girls like me don't go
out with losers like you.

1219
01:04:50.637 --> 01:04:52.429
Let's get out of here.

1220
01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:53.630
Excuse me.

1221
01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.395
Why didn't you call me?

1222
01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:00.229
What?

1223
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:01.563
We spent a beautiful night together,

1224
01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:03.816
and I never hear from you again?

1225
01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:05.224
I, I'm sorry?

1226
01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:10.531
Sorry for what? For breaking my heart?

1227
01:05:10.532 --> 01:05:13.075
Or for giving me the greatest
pleasure I've ever known

1228
01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:15.643
and then just taking it away?

1229
01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:19.373
Both?

1230
01:05:19.374 --> 01:05:20.624
Well, forget it.

1231
01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:23.568
I've already spent too
many hours crying over you.

1232
01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:30.746
So when did you wanna go out?

1233
01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:37.924
Come in.

1234
01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:45.023
Are you done with that deposition yet?

1235
01:05:45.024 --> 01:05:47.359
Yeah, here, take it.

1236
01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.927
I've read it, like, 20 times.

1237
01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:52.064
Okay.

1238
01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:02.193
You know, Elle, I still can't believe

1239
01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:06.044
you didn't tell Callahan the alibi.

1240
01:06:06.045 --> 01:06:08.505
It's not my alibi to tell.

1241
01:06:08.506 --> 01:06:09.706
I know.

1242
01:06:10.175 --> 01:06:13.834
And I thought that was very classy of you.

1243
01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:17.431
Really?

1244
01:06:17.432 --> 01:06:18.632
Sure.

1245
01:06:20.351 --> 01:06:21.551
Thanks.

1246
01:06:29.194 --> 01:06:30.819
Did you ever notice how Callahan

1247
01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:33.572
never asks Warner to bring him his coffee?

1248
01:06:33.573 --> 01:06:37.701
I mean, he's asked me at least ten times.

1249
01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:40.954
Well, men are helpless, you know that.

1250
01:06:40.955 --> 01:06:41.788
I know.

1251
01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:42.998
Warner doesn't do his own laundry.

1252
01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:43.832
I know.

1253
01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:44.708
He has to have it sent out.

1254
01:06:44.709 --> 01:06:47.947
I know.

1255
01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:54.218
Did you know, when he first
applied he got wait-listed?

1256
01:06:54.219 --> 01:06:55.419
What?

1257
01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:59.556
His father had to make a call.

1258
01:06:59.557 --> 01:07:01.214
You're kidding.

1259
01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:04.755
No way!

1260
01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:10.025
God.

1261
01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:12.778
That is such a precious dog, hi.

1262
01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:13.695
His name is Bruiser.

1263
01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:14.813
Do you wanna hold him?

1264
01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:17.974
- He's very friendly.
- Sure.

1265
01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:20.402
Aw.

1266
01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:24.456
Look, he likes you.

1267
01:07:24.457 --> 01:07:26.319
He's giving me kisses.

1268
01:07:29.254 --> 01:07:30.337
Thanks, Jeff.

1269
01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:33.298
We're here today covering
the trial of Brooke Windham.

1270
01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:34.716
Now you may remember, she's charged

1271
01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.176
with the murder of her husband,

1272
01:07:36.177 --> 01:07:38.512
Boston millionaire Heyworth Windham.

1273
01:07:38.513 --> 01:07:42.140
First to testify are the
victim's daughter and ex-wife.

1274
01:07:42.141 --> 01:07:43.392
Superior Court of Suffolk County

1275
01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:44.351
is now in session.

1276
01:07:44.352 --> 01:07:47.187
The Honorable Judge Marina
R. Bickford presiding.

1277
01:07:47.188 --> 01:07:48.845
You may be seated.

1278
01:07:57.115 --> 01:07:59.449
And where was she exactly?

1279
01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:02.768
Standing over my father's dead body.

1280
01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:06.707
And what was the defendant doing?

1281
01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:09.751
Well, she was sitting
next to the pool, topless

1282
01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:13.286
while the Latin boy handed her a drink.

1283
01:08:14.716 --> 01:08:19.877
Mr. Salvatore,
can you tell us what this is?

1284
01:08:20.013 --> 01:08:21.213
My uniform.

1285
01:08:22.181 --> 01:08:25.684
This is the uniform that Mrs. Windham

1286
01:08:25.685 --> 01:08:29.344
asked you to wear while cleaning her pool?

1287
01:08:31.691 --> 01:08:32.891
Yes.

1288
01:08:33.735 --> 01:08:34.943
And are you, or are you not,

1289
01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:38.182
having an affair with Brooke Windham?

1290
01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:41.908
Define affair.

1291
01:08:41.909 --> 01:08:46.149
Have you and Mrs. Windham
had sexual relations?

1292
01:08:47.123 --> 01:08:48.689
Yes, okay, yes.

1293
01:08:54.547 --> 01:08:55.756
Ladies and gentlemen,

1294
01:08:55.757 --> 01:08:59.843
court will reconvene
tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.

1295
01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:01.330
We're adjourned.

1296
01:09:04.599 --> 01:09:05.682
You know a Delta Nu would never

1297
01:09:05.683 --> 01:09:07.225
sleep with a man who wears a thong.

1298
01:09:07.226 --> 01:09:08.101
Never!

1299
01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:10.729
I just liked watching
him clean the filter.

1300
01:09:10.730 --> 01:09:12.898
I know, I believe you, Brooke.

1301
01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:13.857
Take care of me, Elle.

1302
01:09:13.858 --> 01:09:15.299
I will.

1303
01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:37.533
I got a big one for ya.

1304
01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:46.129
Can you sign?

1305
01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:54.714
Yeah.

1306
01:10:21.676 --> 01:10:24.539
I got it.

1307
01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:28.724
You broke his nose?

1308
01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:30.600
I blew it, Elle.

1309
01:10:30.601 --> 01:10:32.894
My snap was all over the place.

1310
01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:34.354
I'll be there right as
as soon as court is out.

1311
01:10:34.355 --> 01:10:36.106
We have to cross-examine Enrique.

1312
01:10:36.107 --> 01:10:37.399
But don't worry, my girlfriend, Serena,

1313
01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.109
once barfed on a guy during
The Blair Witch Project,

1314
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:40.652
and they ended up dating for three months.

1315
01:10:40.653 --> 01:10:41.486
Really?

1316
01:10:41.487 --> 01:10:43.155
All right, bye-bye.

1317
01:10:43.156 --> 01:10:44.356
Okay, bye.

1318
01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:57.502
Don't stomp your little

1319
01:10:57.503 --> 01:11:00.741
last-season Prada shoes at me, honey.

1320
01:11:01.466 --> 01:11:03.282
They're not last season.

1321
01:11:09.724 --> 01:11:11.349
Emmett.

1322
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:12.225
He's gay.

1323
01:11:12.226 --> 01:11:13.518
Enrique is gay.

1324
01:11:13.519 --> 01:11:14.811
What?

1325
01:11:14.812 --> 01:11:16.396
Warner, what kind of shoes are these?

1326
01:11:16.397 --> 01:11:19.065
Black ones.

1327
01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:19.900
See?

1328
01:11:19.901 --> 01:11:21.443
What are you talking about?

1329
01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:22.277
He's gay.

1330
01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:23.153
He isn't Brooke's lover.

1331
01:11:23.154 --> 01:11:24.654
He's making it up.

1332
01:11:24.655 --> 01:11:25.489
Wait, back up.

1333
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:26.907
How do you know that he's gay?

1334
01:11:26.908 --> 01:11:28.408
Gay men know designers.

1335
01:11:28.409 --> 01:11:30.160
Straight men don't.

1336
01:11:30.161 --> 01:11:30.994
You know what?

1337
01:11:30.995 --> 01:11:35.207
He did leave a Cher tape
in the pool house one time.

1338
01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:37.667
While I appreciate your
masterful legal theory,

1339
01:11:37.668 --> 01:11:41.129
I have a murder trial to attend to.

1340
01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:42.047
Emmett.

1341
01:11:42.048 --> 01:11:43.248
Okay.

1342
01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:47.052
I'll take care of it, thanks.

1343
01:11:47.053 --> 01:11:48.220
Okay.

1344
01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:51.459
Court will come to order.

1345
01:11:56.354 --> 01:11:59.189
Mr.
Salvatore, do you have any proof

1346
01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:03.819
that you and Mrs. Windham
were having an affair?

1347
01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:06.279
Only the love in my heart.

1348
01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:10.033
Well, if that's all the
proof that he has, Your Honor,

1349
01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:11.868
I think I'm done here.

1350
01:12:11.869 --> 01:12:13.036
You may step down.

1351
01:12:13.037 --> 01:12:16.540
I'd like to ask a couple
of questions, Your Honor.

1352
01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:19.449
Just give me a couple of minutes.

1353
01:12:20.753 --> 01:12:23.547
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?

1354
01:12:23.548 --> 01:12:24.506
Yes.

1355
01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:25.549
Where?

1356
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:28.134
A restaurant in Concord,
where no one could recognize us.

1357
01:12:28.135 --> 01:12:30.095
And how long have you been
sleeping with Mrs. Windham?

1358
01:12:30.096 --> 01:12:30.929
Three months.

1359
01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:32.013
And your boyfriend's name is?

1360
01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:33.705
- Chuck.
- Right.

1361
01:12:38.646 --> 01:12:39.604
Silence!

1362
01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:40.438
Silence!

1363
01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:41.273
Pardon, pardon me.

1364
01:12:41.274 --> 01:12:42.107
Yes, Mr. Salvatore?

1365
01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:44.192
I was confused, you see?

1366
01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:46.736
I thought you said friend,
Chuck is just a friend.

1367
01:12:46.737 --> 01:12:47.946
Okay.

1368
01:12:47.947 --> 01:12:49.183
You bitch!

1369
01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:52.284
Chuck wait!

1370
01:12:52.285 --> 01:12:53.451
Silence in my court.

1371
01:12:53.452 --> 01:12:55.564
Sit down, Mr. Salvatore.

1372
01:12:58.082 --> 01:13:00.148
Silence in my courtroom!

1373
01:13:01.085 --> 01:13:04.212
How did I miss that?

1374
01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:07.883
Silence in my courtroom.

1375
01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:10.076
Thanks.

1376
01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:14.180
Good night.

1377
01:13:14.181 --> 01:13:16.168
Good night.

1378
01:13:18.686 --> 01:13:21.730
Elle. Callahan asked
to see you before you leave.

1379
01:13:21.731 --> 01:13:22.564
Really?

1380
01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:23.773
Yeah, you know, he
already has his coffee,

1381
01:13:23.774 --> 01:13:25.525
but maybe he needs a donut.

1382
01:13:25.526 --> 01:13:26.651
Okay.

1383
01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:27.485
Do you need help?

1384
01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:28.445
No, I'm fine.

1385
01:13:28.446 --> 01:13:29.646
Okay. Bye.

1386
01:13:35.036 --> 01:13:36.236
Come on in.

1387
01:13:38.122 --> 01:13:39.706
Hi.
Hi.

1388
01:13:39.707 --> 01:13:40.540
Sit down.

1389
01:13:40.541 --> 01:13:41.741
Okay.

1390
01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:51.551
Is everything all right?

1391
01:13:51.552 --> 01:13:53.845
You followed your intuition today,

1392
01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:56.413
and you were right on target.

1393
01:13:57.725 --> 01:13:59.893
I should have listened.

1394
01:13:59.894 --> 01:14:01.094
Thank you.

1395
01:14:02.647 --> 01:14:04.272
About the alibi.

1396
01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:05.106
I'm sorry...

1397
01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:06.399
I'm impressed that you took

1398
01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.360
the initiative to go there and get it.

1399
01:14:08.361 --> 01:14:10.654
That's what makes a good lawyer.

1400
01:14:10.655 --> 01:14:11.488
And on top of that,

1401
01:14:11.489 --> 01:14:13.907
you gained the client's trust and kept it.

1402
01:14:13.908 --> 01:14:16.701
That's what makes a great lawyer.

1403
01:14:16.702 --> 01:14:18.438
You're smart, Elle.

1404
01:14:19.246 --> 01:14:22.154
Smarter than most of
the guys on my payroll.

1405
01:14:24.418 --> 01:14:26.962
I think it's time to
discuss your career path.

1406
01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:28.588
Have you thought about

1407
01:14:28.589 --> 01:14:31.633
where you might be a summer associate?

1408
01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:33.120
Not really.

1409
01:14:34.428 --> 01:14:35.720
I know it's very competitive.

1410
01:14:35.721 --> 01:14:36.888
Well, you know what

1411
01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:40.600
competition's really about, don't you?

1412
01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:43.168
It's about ferocity, carnage.

1413
01:14:44.772 --> 01:14:49.182
Balancing human intelligence
with animal diligence.

1414
01:14:50.736 --> 01:14:53.947
Knowing exactly what you want

1415
01:14:53.948 --> 01:14:56.765
and how far you'll go to get it.

1416
01:14:57.660 --> 01:14:59.522
How far will Elle go?

1417
01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.209
Are you hitting on me?

1418
01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:08.527
You're a beautiful girl.

1419
01:15:09.296 --> 01:15:10.922
So everything you just said?

1420
01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:14.175
I'm a man who knows what he wants.

1421
01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:15.635
And I'm a law student who just realized

1422
01:15:15.636 --> 01:15:18.795
her professor is a pathetic asshole.

1423
01:15:19.473 --> 01:15:20.306
Too bad.

1424
01:15:20.307 --> 01:15:23.215
I thought you were a law student
who wanted to be a lawyer.

1425
01:15:40.244 --> 01:15:42.871
You almost had me fooled.

1426
01:15:42.872 --> 01:15:44.205
What?

1427
01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:45.957
Well, maybe you should
sleep with the jury too.

1428
01:15:45.958 --> 01:15:48.571
Then we can win the case.

1429
01:16:03.476 --> 01:16:04.476
Hey.

1430
01:16:04.477 --> 01:16:06.061
I'm quitting.

1431
01:16:06.062 --> 01:16:07.395
Why?

1432
01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:08.646
Law school was a mistake.

1433
01:16:08.647 --> 01:16:10.273
This whole internship was a mistake!

1434
01:16:10.274 --> 01:16:11.149
What are you talking about?

1435
01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:11.983
You earned it.

1436
01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:14.944
I didn't earn anything, Emmett.

1437
01:16:14.945 --> 01:16:16.446
Callahan only gave me that internship

1438
01:16:16.447 --> 01:16:18.281
because he liked the way I looked.

1439
01:16:18.282 --> 01:16:19.282
Which he made clear tonight

1440
01:16:19.283 --> 01:16:22.368
when he tried to feel me up.

1441
01:16:22.369 --> 01:16:24.185
Callahan did what?

1442
01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:27.248
Just forget about it.

1443
01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:28.500
I'm going back to LA.

1444
01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:30.293
No more boring suits, no more pantyhose.

1445
01:16:30.294 --> 01:16:33.671
No more trying to be
something that I'm just,

1446
01:16:33.672 --> 01:16:34.908
I'm just not.

1447
01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:40.053
What if you're trying
to be somebody you are?

1448
01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:42.792
I mean, the hell with Callahan.

1449
01:16:44.391 --> 01:16:45.957
Stay.

1450
01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:52.093
Call me if you're ever
in California, okay?

1451
01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:10.708
What's the point in staying, Paulette?

1452
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:12.335
I mean,

1453
01:17:12.336 --> 01:17:13.795
all people see when they look at me

1454
01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:16.506
is blonde hair and big boobs.

1455
01:17:16.507 --> 01:17:18.925
No one's ever gonna take me seriously.

1456
01:17:18.926 --> 01:17:20.301
People at law school don't.

1457
01:17:20.302 --> 01:17:22.470
And Warner doesn't.

1458
01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:26.961
I don't even think my own
parents take me seriously.

1459
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:31.187
It just felt like, for the first time,

1460
01:17:31.188 --> 01:17:33.675
that someone expected me to,

1461
01:17:34.358 --> 01:17:35.817
to do something more with my life

1462
01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:39.557
than just become a
Victoria's Secret model.

1463
01:17:41.448 --> 01:17:43.908
But I was just kidding myself.

1464
01:17:43.909 --> 01:17:45.368
Callahan never saw me as a lawyer,

1465
01:17:45.369 --> 01:17:47.787
he just saw me as a piece of ass.

1466
01:17:47.788 --> 01:17:50.025
Just like everybody else.

1467
01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:54.071
Turns out I am a joke.

1468
01:17:56.088 --> 01:18:00.884
No, you're not a joke.

1469
01:18:00.885 --> 01:18:03.094
Just brush this right here.

1470
01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:04.331
There you go.

1471
01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:08.266
The hell with law school.

1472
01:18:08.267 --> 01:18:09.767
I just wanted to say goodbye.

1473
01:18:09.768 --> 01:18:11.352
And you're all done.

1474
01:18:11.353 --> 01:18:12.896
If you're going to let

1475
01:18:12.897 --> 01:18:15.635
one stupid prick ruin your life

1476
01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:24.977
you're not the girl I thought you were.

1477
01:18:41.675 --> 01:18:42.508
Did you go in there knowing

1478
01:18:42.509 --> 01:18:44.469
how you were going to
discredit Mr. Salvatore?

1479
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:45.303
Absolutely.

1480
01:18:45.304 --> 01:18:49.724
It's a little thing I
like to call strategy.

1481
01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:52.602
You know, I had a about
feeling Mr. Salvatore.

1482
01:18:52.603 --> 01:18:54.354
Is he always such an ass?

1483
01:18:54.355 --> 01:18:56.606
He's the top defense
attorney in the state.

1484
01:18:56.607 --> 01:18:57.732
Of course he's an ass.

1485
01:18:57.733 --> 01:19:01.236
Fine, but is he an ass
that's gonna win my case?

1486
01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:03.363
Well, he's an ass that's gonna try.

1487
01:19:03.364 --> 01:19:05.406
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?

1488
01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:06.783
That's not what's important.

1489
01:19:06.784 --> 01:19:09.494
If he doesn't trust me,
why should I trust him?

1490
01:19:09.495 --> 01:19:10.328
Ask Elle.

1491
01:19:10.329 --> 01:19:12.580
She looked pretty cozy
with him last night.

1492
01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:13.706
No, you don't even know

1493
01:19:13.707 --> 01:19:16.775
what the hell you're talking about.

1494
01:19:17.503 --> 01:19:20.046
What's going on here?

1495
01:19:20.047 --> 01:19:21.381
Elle quit.

1496
01:19:21.382 --> 01:19:22.215
What?

1497
01:19:22.216 --> 01:19:25.510
Yeah, Callahan hit on her, so she quit.

1498
01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:27.498
My God, scumbag.

1499
01:19:29.348 --> 01:19:30.640
God.

1500
01:19:30.641 --> 01:19:31.841
What?

1501
01:19:33.018 --> 01:19:33.935
I feel terrible.

1502
01:19:33.936 --> 01:19:35.923
I made a huge mistake.

1503
01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:48.144
Well, maybe there's
something we can do about it.

1504
01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:52.109
Thank you.

1505
01:19:56.667 --> 01:19:57.583
What are you so happy about?

1506
01:19:57.584 --> 01:19:59.711
You're on trial for murder.

1507
01:19:59.712 --> 01:20:00.912
Get up.

1508
01:20:02.298 --> 01:20:03.172
What?

1509
01:20:03.173 --> 01:20:04.799
You're fired.

1510
01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:07.677
I have new representation.

1511
01:20:07.678 --> 01:20:09.289
Who?

1512
01:20:31.452 --> 01:20:32.410
Excuse you.

1513
01:20:32.411 --> 01:20:33.369
You're in my way.

1514
01:20:33.370 --> 01:20:34.245
She's law a student.

1515
01:20:34.246 --> 01:20:35.732
She can't defend you.

1516
01:20:36.457 --> 01:20:41.127
Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court Ruling 3.03.

1517
01:20:41.128 --> 01:20:42.328
See?

1518
01:20:43.172 --> 01:20:44.130
Thank you, David.

1519
01:20:44.131 --> 01:20:47.039
Counselors, approach the bench.

1520
01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:49.093
You're not going up there.

1521
01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:50.011
Yes, I am.

1522
01:20:50.012 --> 01:20:51.596
I'm sorry, maybe you didn't hear me.

1523
01:20:51.597 --> 01:20:53.473
You're fired.

1524
01:20:53.474 --> 01:20:55.600
Counselors, now!

1525
01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:56.801
All of you.

1526
01:21:01.398 --> 01:21:02.774
Elle Woods, Your Honor.

1527
01:21:02.775 --> 01:21:05.610
Rule 3.03 of Supreme Judicial Court

1528
01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:07.570
states that a law student
may appear on behalf

1529
01:21:07.571 --> 01:21:09.489
of a defendant in criminal proceedings

1530
01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:11.783
Your Honor, I have no problem with this.

1531
01:21:11.784 --> 01:21:13.242
I do, I'm not allowing it.

1532
01:21:13.243 --> 01:21:15.078
But you agreed last night.

1533
01:21:15.079 --> 01:21:18.956
In your office, when we
were discussing my career?

1534
01:21:18.957 --> 01:21:21.000
The ruling also states that you need

1535
01:21:21.001 --> 01:21:24.128
a licensed attorney to supervise you.

1536
01:21:24.129 --> 01:21:25.421
Mr. Callahan?

1537
01:21:25.422 --> 01:21:28.132
That I won't agree to.

1538
01:21:28.133 --> 01:21:30.885
I'll supervise, Your Honor.

1539
01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:33.888
Well, then, Ms. Woods, proceed.

1540
01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:36.376
Thank you, Your Honor.

1541
01:21:40.938 --> 01:21:43.335
Hi.

1542
01:21:49.405 --> 01:21:50.812
Enjoy prison.

1543
01:21:52.282 --> 01:21:56.035
Mrs. Windham, you do
realize what you're doing?

1544
01:21:56.036 --> 01:21:57.272
Absolutely.

1545
01:21:59.957 --> 01:22:00.873
My God.

1546
01:22:00.874 --> 01:22:02.166
There she is, Elle!

1547
01:22:02.167 --> 01:22:04.877
Elle, we came to see your trial.

1548
01:22:04.878 --> 01:22:06.129
Look, how cute!

1549
01:22:06.130 --> 01:22:10.842
There's, like, a judge and
everything and jury people.

1550
01:22:10.843 --> 01:22:12.009
Vote for Elle!

1551
01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:14.345
Ladies, take a seat.

1552
01:22:14.346 --> 01:22:15.546
Go, girl.

1553
01:22:20.727 --> 01:22:22.145
Do you swear
to tell the whole truth

1554
01:22:22.146 --> 01:22:23.813
and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?

1555
01:22:23.814 --> 01:22:24.647
I do.

1556
01:22:24.648 --> 01:22:25.848
Be seated.

1557
01:22:27.985 --> 01:22:31.804
Ms. Woods, you may
begin your questioning.

1558
01:22:35.701 --> 01:22:38.077
First of all, I would
like to point out that,

1559
01:22:38.078 --> 01:22:40.037
not only is there no proof in this case,

1560
01:22:40.038 --> 01:22:43.527
but there's a complete lack of mens rea,

1561
01:22:44.418 --> 01:22:48.004
which, by definition, tells
us that there can be no crime

1562
01:22:48.005 --> 01:22:50.071
without a vicious will.

1563
01:22:51.508 --> 01:22:54.135
I am aware of the meaning of mens rea.

1564
01:22:54.136 --> 01:22:56.179
What I'm unaware of is why

1565
01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:57.972
you're giving me a vocabulary lesson

1566
01:22:57.973 --> 01:23:01.792
when you should be
questioning your witness.

1567
01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:04.301
Yes, Your Honor.

1568
01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:08.849
Ms. Windham,

1569
01:23:09.568 --> 01:23:14.729
when you arrived back at the
house was your father there?

1570
01:23:14.907 --> 01:23:16.032
Not that I saw.

1571
01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:20.620
But like I said, I went straight
upstairs to take a shower.

1572
01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:24.440
And when you came
downstairs, what happened?

1573
01:23:25.417 --> 01:23:29.253
I saw Brooke standing over his body,

1574
01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:31.241
drenched in his blood.

1575
01:23:37.262 --> 01:23:39.847
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?

1576
01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:41.682
No, she'd stashed it by then.

1577
01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:43.726
Move to strike that from
the record, Your Honor.

1578
01:23:43.727 --> 01:23:44.644
It's speculation.

1579
01:23:44.645 --> 01:23:45.961
So stricken.

1580
01:23:48.607 --> 01:23:49.807
Go ahead.

1581
01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:58.366
Ms. Windham, did you hear a shot fired?

1582
01:23:58.367 --> 01:24:00.684
No. I was in the shower.

1583
01:24:01.745 --> 01:24:02.870
Okay.

1584
01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:05.529
So, sometime in the 20 minutes

1585
01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:11.087
that you were in the shower
your father was shot?

1586
01:24:11.088 --> 01:24:12.288
I guess.

1587
01:24:13.423 --> 01:24:14.257
Your father was shot

1588
01:24:14.258 --> 01:24:16.759
while you were in the shower

1589
01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.928
but you didn't hear the shot

1590
01:24:18.929 --> 01:24:20.129
because, um,

1591
01:24:24.142 --> 01:24:27.103
because you were in the shower?

1592
01:24:27.104 --> 01:24:28.604
Yes.

1593
01:24:28.605 --> 01:24:30.592
I was washing my hair.

1594
01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:35.778
Where is she going with this?

1595
01:24:35.779 --> 01:24:38.437
Have a little faith, Gerard.

1596
01:24:45.706 --> 01:24:50.025
Ms. Windham, what had
you done earlier that day?

1597
01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:54.589
I got up, got a latte, went to the gym,

1598
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:56.827
got a perm and came home.

1599
01:24:58.802 --> 01:25:01.929
Where you got in the shower?

1600
01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:03.931
I believe the witness has made it clear

1601
01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:06.590
that she was in the shower.

1602
01:25:12.357 --> 01:25:14.191
Yes, Your Honor.

1603
01:25:14.192 --> 01:25:18.154
Ms. Windham, had you ever
gotten a perm before?

1604
01:25:18.155 --> 01:25:19.822
Yes.

1605
01:25:19.823 --> 01:25:22.325
How many, would you say?

1606
01:25:22.326 --> 01:25:25.369
Two a year since I was 12.

1607
01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:27.413
You do the math.

1608
01:25:27.414 --> 01:25:28.789
You know, a girl in my sorority,

1609
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:31.208
Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once.

1610
01:25:31.209 --> 01:25:32.627
We all tried to talk her out of it.

1611
01:25:32.628 --> 01:25:34.712
Curls weren't a good look for her.

1612
01:25:34.713 --> 01:25:36.547
She didn't have your bone structure.

1613
01:25:36.548 --> 01:25:37.715
Aww.

1614
01:25:37.716 --> 01:25:39.925
But thankfully, that same day,

1615
01:25:39.926 --> 01:25:42.053
she entered the Beta Delta
Pi wet T-shirt contest,

1616
01:25:42.054 --> 01:25:42.887
where she was completely

1617
01:25:42.888 --> 01:25:44.096
hosed down from head to toe.

1618
01:25:44.097 --> 01:25:45.389
Objection!

1619
01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:47.391
Why is this relevant?

1620
01:25:47.392 --> 01:25:49.060
I have a point, I promise.

1621
01:25:49.061 --> 01:25:51.145
Then make it.

1622
01:25:51.146 --> 01:25:52.382
Yes, ma'am.

1623
01:25:53.732 --> 01:25:55.566
Chutney, why is that
Tracy Marcinko's curls

1624
01:25:55.567 --> 01:25:59.153
were ruined when she got hosed down?

1625
01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:00.321
Because they got wet.

1626
01:26:00.322 --> 01:26:01.155
Exactly.

1627
01:26:01.156 --> 01:26:03.324
Because isn't it the first
cardinal rule of perm maintenance

1628
01:26:03.325 --> 01:26:05.951
that you're forbidden to wet
your hair for at least 24 hours

1629
01:26:05.952 --> 01:26:08.329
after getting a perm at
the risk of deactivating

1630
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:10.738
the ammonium thioglycolate?

1631
01:26:12.125 --> 01:26:12.958
Yes.

1632
01:26:12.959 --> 01:26:14.085
And wouldn't somebody who's had,

1633
01:26:14.086 --> 01:26:15.920
say 30 perms before in their life

1634
01:26:15.921 --> 01:26:18.255
be well aware of this rule?

1635
01:26:18.256 --> 01:26:20.216
And if you weren't washing your hair,

1636
01:26:20.217 --> 01:26:21.342
as I suspect you weren't,

1637
01:26:21.343 --> 01:26:22.968
because your curls are still intact,

1638
01:26:22.969 --> 01:26:24.470
wouldn't you have heard the gunshot?

1639
01:26:24.471 --> 01:26:26.430
And if, in fact, you
had heard the gunshot,

1640
01:26:26.431 --> 01:26:28.349
Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time

1641
01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:30.393
to hide the gun before you got downstairs,

1642
01:26:30.394 --> 01:26:31.477
which would mean that you would've

1643
01:26:31.478 --> 01:26:33.062
had to have found Mrs. Windham

1644
01:26:33.063 --> 01:26:35.856
with a gun in her hand to
make your story plausible.

1645
01:26:35.857 --> 01:26:36.982
Isn't that right?

1646
01:26:36.983 --> 01:26:39.402
She's my age, did she tell you that?

1647
01:26:39.403 --> 01:26:40.653
How would you feel if your father

1648
01:26:40.654 --> 01:26:41.862
married someone who was your age?

1649
01:26:41.863 --> 01:26:43.656
You, however, had time to hide the gun,

1650
01:26:43.657 --> 01:26:44.782
didn't you, Chutney?

1651
01:26:44.783 --> 01:26:45.866
After you shot your father.

1652
01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:47.493
I didn't mean to shoot him!

1653
01:26:47.494 --> 01:26:49.526
I thought it was you
walking through the door!

1654
01:26:53.166 --> 01:26:54.607
Order, order.

1655
01:26:55.293 --> 01:26:56.327
Order.

1656
01:26:57.879 --> 01:27:01.813
My God.

1657
01:27:03.677 --> 01:27:05.970
Bailiff, take the witness into custody,

1658
01:27:05.971 --> 01:27:07.346
where she will be charged

1659
01:27:07.347 --> 01:27:09.724
for the murder of Heyworth Windham.

1660
01:27:09.725 --> 01:27:12.935
In the matter of The State
versus Brooke Windham,

1661
01:27:12.936 --> 01:27:14.645
this case is dismissed.

1662
01:27:14.646 --> 01:27:16.856
Mrs. Windham, you are free to go.

1663
01:27:16.857 --> 01:27:19.219
Yes!

1664
01:27:28.577 --> 01:27:30.313
Thank you!

1665
01:27:34.291 --> 01:27:36.292
Elle, how did you
know Chutney was lying?

1666
01:27:36.293 --> 01:27:37.585
'Cause she's brilliant, of course.

1667
01:27:37.586 --> 01:27:40.073
The rules of hair care
are simple and finite.

1668
01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:41.620
Any Cosmo girl would've known.

1669
01:27:44.509 --> 01:27:46.746
Elle, Elle, Elle, Elle.

1670
01:27:47.637 --> 01:27:48.763
What?

1671
01:27:48.764 --> 01:27:51.432
I just wanted to say that you were

1672
01:27:51.433 --> 01:27:53.851
so brilliant in there.

1673
01:27:53.852 --> 01:27:55.759
And that I was wrong.

1674
01:27:57.773 --> 01:28:00.215
And you are the girl for me.

1675
01:28:02.486 --> 01:28:03.444
Really?

1676
01:28:03.445 --> 01:28:04.528
Yes.

1677
01:28:04.529 --> 01:28:06.516
Pooh Bear, I love you.

1678
01:28:09.451 --> 01:28:11.202
Warner.

1679
01:28:11.203 --> 01:28:14.771
I've waited so long to hear you say that.

1680
01:28:16.291 --> 01:28:17.333
But if I'm gonna be a partner in

1681
01:28:17.334 --> 01:28:19.126
a law firm by the time I'm 30,

1682
01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:19.960
I need a boyfriend who's

1683
01:28:19.961 --> 01:28:21.823
not such a complete bonehead.

1684
01:28:26.593 --> 01:28:28.079
Thank you, boys.

1685
01:28:34.643 --> 01:28:36.310
Ladies and gentlemen,

1686
01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:40.397
I present the graduates
of Harvard Law School.

1687
01:28:40.398 --> 01:28:42.134
Class of 2004.

1688
01:28:44.903 --> 01:28:48.697
I am personally very honored to introduce

1689
01:28:48.698 --> 01:28:51.367
this year's class-elected speaker.

1690
01:28:51.368 --> 01:28:53.494
After getting off to a quite

1691
01:28:53.495 --> 01:28:55.955
interesting start here at Harvard,

1692
01:28:55.956 --> 01:28:59.583
she graduates today with
an invitation to join

1693
01:28:59.584 --> 01:29:03.838
one of Boston's most
prestigious law firms.

1694
01:29:03.839 --> 01:29:08.050
I am sure we are going to
see great things from her.

1695
01:29:08.051 --> 01:29:10.959
Ladies and gentlemen, Elle Woods.

1696
01:29:11.721 --> 01:29:15.710
Yeah!

1697
01:29:33.326 --> 01:29:35.369
On our very first day at Harvard,

1698
01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:38.779
a very wise professor quoted Aristotle.

1699
01:29:39.499 --> 01:29:43.127
"The law is reason free from passion."

1700
01:29:43.128 --> 01:29:46.130
Well, no offense to Aristotle,

1701
01:29:46.131 --> 01:29:47.798
but in my three years at Harvard,

1702
01:29:47.799 --> 01:29:49.675
I have come to find that passion

1703
01:29:49.676 --> 01:29:51.969
is a key ingredient to the study

1704
01:29:51.970 --> 01:29:54.787
and practice of law and of life.

1705
01:29:56.182 --> 01:29:59.059
It is with passion, courage of conviction,

1706
01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:01.103
and strong sense of self

1707
01:30:01.104 --> 01:30:04.106
that we take our next
steps into the world,

1708
01:30:04.107 --> 01:30:09.111
remembering that first impressions
are not always correct.

1709
01:30:09.112 --> 01:30:12.239
You must always have faith in people

1710
01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:17.401
and most importantly you must
always have faith in yourself.

1711
01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:24.488
Congratulations, class of 2004.

1712
01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:26.745
We did it!
