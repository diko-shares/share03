1
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.520
Yeah!

2
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.120
Hands up!

3
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.760
- Hi.
- Hi.

4
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.720
- Hi.
- Hi.

5
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.800
Here it is.

6
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.440
Thanks.

7
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.880
Did you guys sign it?

8
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.080
Hi.

9
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.400
- Did you sign the card?
- Yeah.

10
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.480
And five and four...

11
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.920
- Hey, girls, sign.
- Yeah.

12
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.840
- All right.
- Yeah.

13
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.280
Here you go.

14
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.840
- Elle's gonna love it.
- Thanks.

15
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.120
You go, girl.

16
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.080
Hi, girls. Here, sign.

17
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.040
Thanks.

18
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.040
There she is.

19
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.640
- All right.
- Thank you.

20
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.560
I love that restaurant.

21
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.400
I heard Madonna went
into labor there.

22
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.096
Oh, gosh. I have to go shopping.

23
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.440
Okay, I'll see you tonight.

24
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.080
Okay. Bye.

25
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.920
Bruiser, what's this?

26
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.360
"Good luck tonight.
Elle and Warner forever."

27
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.920
That's so cute.

28
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.800
Oh, my gosh. You guys are so sweet.

29
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.600
But I'm not positive
it's gonna happen tonight.

30
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.120
Hello. He just had lunch
with his grandmother.

31
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.360
You know he got the rock.

32
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.560
Why else would she have flown
in from Newport?

33
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.000
It's not like she'd FedEx
a six-carat diamond.

34
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.080
Do you really think?

35
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.040
I can't believe
you're getting engaged.

36
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.440
Oh, my gosh.

37
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.600
You guys have to help me
pick out the perfect outfit.

38
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.400
Come on.

39
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.800
I think you should go with the red.
It's the color of confidence.

40
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.200
I don't understand why
you're completely disregarding

41
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.280
your signature color.

42
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.480
He's proposing.

43
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.600
I can't look like
I would on any other date.

44
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.720
This is the date,
the night I'll always remember.

45
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.520
I want to look special.

46
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.960
Bridal.

47
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.560
But not like I expect anything.

48
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.880
There's nothing I love
more than a dumb blonde

49
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.320
with daddy's plastic.

50
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.736
You know how he gets excited
when I even just...

51
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.920
Did you see this one?
We just got it in yesterday.

52
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.360
Is this low-viscosity rayon?

53
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.680
Yes. Of course.

54
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.480
With a half-loop top-stitching
on the hem?

55
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.760
Absolutely. It's one of a kind.

56
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.040
It's impossible to use a half-loop
top-stitching on low-viscosity rayon.

57
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.360
It would snag the fabric.

58
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.320
And you didn't just get it in.

59
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.040
I saw it in the June <i>Vogue</i>
a year ago.

60
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.080
So if you're trying
to sell it for full price

61
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.520
you picked the wrong girl.

62
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.880
Girls, this is it.

63
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.240
In a few hours

64
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.200
I'll be the future
Mrs. Warner Huntington III.

65
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.640
Hello.

66
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.600
- You look so beautiful.
- So do you.

67
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.760
Let's get out of here.

68
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.080
Must be strange
having such perfect eyes.

69
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.920
God, you're so wonderful.
Elle, thank you.

70
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.760
- Here's to us.
- To us.

71
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.960
- Elle.
- Yes?

72
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.536
One of the reasons
I wanted to come here tonight

73
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.320
was to discuss our future.

74
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.440
And I am fully amenable
to that discussion.

75
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.880
Good.

76
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.096
Well, you know how we've been
having all kinds of fun lately?

77
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.200
- Yeah.
- Well...

78
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.320
Harvard is gonna be different.

79
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.400
Law school is a completely
different world

80
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.280
and I need to be serious.

81
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.360
Of course.

82
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.400
I mean, my family expects
a lot from me.

83
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.640
- Right.
- I expect a lot from me.

84
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.360
I plan on running for office someday.

85
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.736
And I fully support that one.
You know that, right?

86
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.760
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

87
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.240
But the thing is
if I'm gonna be a senator

88
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.480
by the time I'm 30

89
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.080
I need to stop dicking around.

90
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.760
Warner, I completely agree.

91
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.680
Well, that's why I think it's time
for us.

92
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.560
- Elle, pooh bear.
- Yes?

93
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.200
- I do.
- I think we should break up.

94
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.120
What?

95
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.336
Well, I've been thinking about it

96
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.880
and I think it's the right thing
to do.

97
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.280
You're breaking up with me?

98
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.360
I thought you were proposing.

99
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.720
Proposing?

100
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.960
Elle, if I'm gonna be a senator...

101
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.840
well, I need to marry a Jackie,
not a Marilyn.

102
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.480
So you're breaking up with me
because I'm too... blonde?

103
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.760
No. That's not entirely true.

104
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.040
Then what? My boobs are too big?

105
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.080
Elle, your boobs are fine.

106
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.440
So when you said
that you would always love me

107
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.920
you were just dicking around?

108
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.240
Elle, I do love you. I...

109
00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.840
I just can't marry you.

110
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.360
You have no idea of the pressure
that I am under.

111
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.000
My family has five generations
of senators.

112
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.200
My brother's in the top three
at Yale Law.

113
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.840
And he just got engaged
to a Vanderbilt, for Christ's sake.

114
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.720
Bad salad.

115
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.520
Sweetie.

116
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.440
Pooh bear?

117
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.560
It's not like I have a choice here,
sweetheart.

118
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.200
Okay. You get the car,
I'll get the check.

119
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.600
I won't be having the salad.

120
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.720
Come on, let me take you home.

121
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.440
No.

122
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.760
Elle, believe me,
I never expected to do this.

123
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.960
But I think it's the right thing.

124
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.840
How can it be the right thing
when we're not together?

125
00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.760
Well, I have to think of my future
and what my family expects of me.

126
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.120
So you're breaking up with me

127
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.240
because you're afraid
your family won't like me?

128
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.200
Everybody likes me.

129
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.240
Well, East Coast people
are different.

130
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.680
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt,
suddenly I'm white trash?

131
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.160
I grew up in Bel Air, Warner

132
00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.760
across the street
from Aaron Spelling.

133
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.576
I think most people
would agree that's a lot better

134
00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.320
than some stinky old Vanderbilt.

135
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.000
I told you. I need someone serious.

136
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.760
But I'm seriously in love with you.

137
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.880
Isn't that enough?

138
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.000
Pooh bear, just get in the car.

139
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.640
No.

140
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.080
You're gonna ruin your shoes.

141
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Okay.

142
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.080
Morning, Amy.

143
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.480
Elle, it's Amy.

144
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.000
I'm having trouble
with this whole lip-liner thing.

145
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.800
- Sweetie, didn't you hear?
- Hear what?

146
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.160
It's terrible. He dumped her.

147
00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:52.880
<i>Why me?</i>

148
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.680
<i>Because you're not gonna remember
anything after tonight.</i>

149
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.240
<i>Oh, you're wrong.</i>

150
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.440
<i>I will remember, no matter what.</i>

151
00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.640
<i>And I'm never gonna lose you again.</i>

152
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.960
<i>You couldn't.</i>

153
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.520
<i>You're a part of me.</i>

154
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.440
<i>I love you.</i>

155
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.640
Liar!

156
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.640
Honey, you have to leave this room.

157
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.240
It's been, like, a week.

158
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.080
- So?
- Drink this.

159
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.120
What's the one thing
that always makes us feel better

160
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.160
no matter what?

161
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.000
She had eight grilled cheese
sandwiches.

162
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.216
She stuffed them in her mouth
all at once.

163
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.240
It was so sad.

164
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.936
We all thought she'd be the first
to walk down the aisle

165
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.080
and now she's totally adrift.

166
00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.680
Totally.

167
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.720
She hasn't conditioned her hair
in like a week.

168
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.800
Maybe she's going
for the grunge look.

169
00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.240
And, like, her nails
are full-on chipped.

170
00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.360
So trailer park.

171
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.800
Oh, my God.

172
00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.120
- Do you know who this is?
- No.

173
00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.920
- That's Warner's older brother.
- Who?

174
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.800
"Third year Yale Law student
Putnam Bowes Huntington III

175
00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.640
and his fiancée
Layne Walker Vanderbilt

176
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.000
first year Yale Law."

177
00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.640
This is the type of girl
that Warner wants to marry.

178
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.360
This is what I need to become
to be serious.

179
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.000
What? Practically deformed?

180
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.280
No.

181
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.920
A law student.

182
00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.960
Elle.

183
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.840
Law school?

184
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.160
It's a perfectly
respectable place, daddy.

185
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.280
Honey, you were first runner up
at the Miss Hawaiian Tropics contest.

186
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.680
Why are you gonna
throw that all away?

187
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.056
Going to Harvard is the only way

188
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.600
I'm gonna get
the love of my life back.

189
00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.840
Oh, sweetheart,
you don't need law school.

190
00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:05.440
Law school is for people
who are boring and ugly and serious.

191
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.880
And you, Button,
are none of those things.

192
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.040
- Harvard Law School?
- That's right.

193
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.480
- But that's a top three school.
- Oh, I have a 4.0

194
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.320
Yes, but your major
is fashion merchandising.

195
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:30.000
Harvard won't be impressed
that you aced History of Polka Dots.

196
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.320
What are your backups?

197
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.760
I don't need backups.
I'm going to Harvard.

198
00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:44.080
Well, then, you'll need excellent
recommendations from your professors.

199
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.400
Okay.

200
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.400
And a heck of an admissions essay.

201
00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.840
Right.

202
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.360
And at least a 175 on your LSATs.

203
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.640
I once had to judge
a tighty-whitey contest

204
00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.840
for Lambda Kappa Pi.

205
00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.880
Trust me, I can handle anything.

206
00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.720
Thanks.

207
00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:08.880
You're welcome.

208
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.080
because then I have a metrabolism.
I have a really high metrabolism.

209
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.240
It's metabol...

210
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Oh, my God.

211
00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.120
What are you doing?

212
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.840
Reading about the LSATs.

213
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.400
My cousin had that.

214
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.480
Apparently, you get
a really bad rash on your...

215
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.680
The LSATs are an exam.
Girls, I'm going to Harvard.

216
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.160
- You mean like on vacay?
- Let's all go.

217
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.520
- Road trip!
- Road trip!

218
00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.680
No. I'm going to Harvard Law School.

219
00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.040
Why?

220
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.040
Elle, now, I know
you're upset about all this

221
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.520
but can't you just take a Percocet?

222
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.160
Okay.

223
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.520
Once Warner sees me
as a serious law student

224
00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.720
he'll totally want me back.

225
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.280
It's a completely brilliant plan.

226
00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.320
But isn't it hard
to get into law school?

227
00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.520
I had the highest GPA in Delta Nu.

228
00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.320
Oh, well.
Here, you're gonna need this.

229
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.520
Your scrunchy?

230
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.240
My lucky scrunchy.
It helped me pass Spanish.

231
00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.240
You passed Spanish because
you gave Professor Montoya

232
00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.680
a lap dance after the final.

233
00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.840
Yeah, luckily.

234
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.640
{\an5}<i>Hi, My name is Elle Woods</i>

235
00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.560
{\an5}<i>and for my admissions essay</i>

236
00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.920
<i>I'm gonna tell all of you at Harvard,
why I'm gonna make an amazing lawyer.</i>

237
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.480
<i>As president of my sorority</i>

238
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.520
<i>I'm skilled at commanding
the attention of a room</i>

239
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.400
<i>and discussing very important issues.</i>

240
00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.640
<i>It has come to my attention that
the maintenance staff</i>

241
00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.880
<i>is switching our toilet paper
from Charmin to generic.</i>

242
00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.480
<i>All those opposed
to chafing please say "aye."</i>

243
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.040
<i>- Aye.
- Aye.</i>

244
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.560
A, neither type of opera
or neither type of rap is on sale.

245
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.960
B, neither type of jazz
and neither type of opera is on sale.

246
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.840
C, neither type of opera
and neither type of soul...

247
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.920
- Party.
- Delta Nu, we love you.

248
00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.040
- Hey.
- Yeah, we love you, Kendall!

249
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.200
- Okay.
- Okay.

250
00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.240
<i>I'm able to recall
hundreds of important details</i>

251
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.400
<i>at the drop of a hat.</i>

252
00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.600
<i>Hey, Elle, do you know what happened</i>
<i>on</i> Days of Our Lives <i>yesterday?</i>

253
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.320
<i>Why, yes, Margot, I do.</i>

254
00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.120
<i>Once again, we join Hope
in the search for her identity.</i>

255
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.880
<i>As you know, she's been brainwashed
by the evil Stefano.</i>

256
00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.040
Ready, get set, and go.

257
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.600
and six, seven, eight, and...

258
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.280
One forty-three.

259
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.880
<i>I feel comfortable using legal jargon
in everyday life.</i>

260
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.840
<i>I object.</i>

261
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.120
It's here.

262
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.240
- Elle.
- What?

263
00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.480
- It's here.
- The LSAT scores.

264
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.120
- It's here.
- Open the scores.

265
00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.080
- What's the score?
- This is so exciting.

266
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.200
- Tell us.
- What is it?

267
00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.200
One seventy-nine.

268
00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.280
One seventy-nine.

269
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.560
<i>And that's why you should vote for me</i>

270
00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.360
<i>Elle Woods, future lawyer
for the Class of 2004.</i>

271
00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:12.480
She does have a 4.0 from CULA,
and she got a 179 on her LSATs.

272
00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.120
A fashion major?

273
00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.720
Well, sir, we've never had one before

274
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.680
and aren't we always looking
for diversity?

275
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.280
Her list of extracurricular
activities is impressive.

276
00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.240
- She was in a Ricky Martin video.
- Clearly, she's interested in music.

277
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:32.000
She also designed a line
of faux fur panties

278
00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.960
for her sorority's charity project.

279
00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.600
She's a friend to the animals
as well as a philanthropist.

280
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.120
Elle Woods.

281
00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.240
Welcome to Harvard.

282
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.920
Bruiser, it's so exciting.
Look. Harvard.

283
00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.720
Are you excited?

284
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.640
This is our new house
for the next three years.

285
00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.960
Oh, are you thirsty?

286
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.880
Okay, let's get you some water.

287
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.920
Sweetheart, you just look parched.

288
00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.400
Hey, Brad, check out Malibu Barbie.

289
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.760
Where's the beach, honey?

290
00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.680
Here you go.

291
00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.840
Good boy. Warner's gonna be
so excited to see you.

292
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.160
Guys, this way.

293
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.920
- This ain't LA.
- Come on, Bruiser.

294
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.120
- Check her out.
- Look at the way she walks.

295
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.296
It's gonna be so exciting.
Now, don't be scared.

296
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.320
Everyone will love you.

297
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.160
Hi. Woods, comma, Elle.

298
00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.960
Class schedule, map, book list.

299
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.200
Wait a second.

300
00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.000
My social events calendar is missing.

301
00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.080
Your what?

302
00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.880
Social events, you know,
mixers, formals

303
00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.360
clambakes, trips to the Cape.

304
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.480
Okay, has Warner Huntington III
checked in yet?

305
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:09.920
No.

306
00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.096
You know, maybe you should check
with the cruise director

307
00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.120
on the Lido deck.

308
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.880
Okay. Welcome to law school.

309
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.680
This is the part where
we go around in a circle

310
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.880
and everyone says a little bit
about themselves.

311
00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.760
Let's start with you.

312
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.080
My name is David Kidney.

313
00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.200
I have a masters
in Russian literature

314
00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.680
a PhD in biochemistry,
and for the last 18 months

315
00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.920
I've been deworming orphans
in Somalia.

316
00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.520
Awesome. What about you?

317
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.880
Hey. How you doing? I'm Enid Wexler.

318
00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.880
I got a PhD from Berkeley
in women's studies

319
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.680
emphasis in the history of combat

320
00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.720
and last year,
I single-handedly organized

321
00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.840
the march for Lesbians
Against Drunk Driving.

322
00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.880
- Killer.
- Thanks. Good times.

323
00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.400
Aaron Mitchell.

324
00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.520
I graduated first in my class
from Princeton.

325
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.840
I have an IQ of 187

326
00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.120
and it's been suggested
that Stephen Hawking

327
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.360
stole his <i>Brief History of Time</i>
from my fourth grade paper.

328
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.320
Cool.

329
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.600
- Me?
- Yeah.

330
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.600
Okay. Hi. I'm Elle Woods,
and this is Bruiser Woods

331
00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.040
and we're both Gemini vegetarians.

332
00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.920
I have a bachelor's degree in fashion
merchandising from CULA

333
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.120
and I was a Zeta Lambda Nu sweetheart

334
00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.240
president of my sorority, Delta Nu.

335
00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.160
And last year,
I was homecoming queen.

336
00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.600
Two weeks ago
I saw Cameron Diaz at Fred Segal

337
00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.240
and I talked her out of buying
this truly heinous angora sweater.

338
00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.520
Whoever said orange was the new pink
was seriously disturbed.

339
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.120
Wish me luck, Bruiser.

340
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.440
This is my first class
as a serious law student.

341
00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.520
I totally look the part.

342
00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:08.880
Hi.

343
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.400
Hey.

344
00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.840
Elle?

345
00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.600
Warner?

346
00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.880
I totally forgot you go here.

347
00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.880
What are you talking about?

348
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.960
I'm sorry. Are you here to see me?

349
00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.080
No, silly. I go here.

350
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.400
- You go where?
- Harvard. Law school.

351
00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:52.240
- You got into Harvard Law?
- What, like it's hard?

352
00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.800
Oh, my gosh, Warner,
it's gonna be so great.

353
00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.240
I'm planning this great mixer.
You totally have to help me.

354
00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.000
I'm thinking like a luau
or maybe like casino night.

355
00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.520
This is gonna be just like
senior year except for funner.

356
00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.920
Time to go. I have to go to class
but meet me after on the benches.

357
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Okay. All right, bye.

358
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.320
A legal education

359
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:32.360
means you will learn to speak
in a new language.

360
00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.840
You will be taught to achieve insight
into the world around you

361
00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.240
and to sharply question
what you know.

362
00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.920
The seat you have picked

363
00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.920
will be yours
for the next nine months

364
00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.400
of your life.

365
00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.080
And those of you in the front row

366
00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.440
beware.

367
00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:02.280
"The law is reason free
from passion."

368
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.720
Does anyone know who spoke
those immortal words?

369
00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.440
- Yes?
- Aristotle.

370
00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.840
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

371
00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.320
Would you be willing
to stake your life on it?

372
00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.240
I think so.

373
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.600
What about his life?

374
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.440
I don't know.

375
00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.880
Well, I recommend knowing
before speaking.

376
00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:46.840
The law leaves much room
for interpretation

377
00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.880
but very little for self-doubt.

378
00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:52.560
And you were right.

379
00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.120
- It was Aristotle.
- Good job.

380
00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.320
Now, I assume all of you have read
pages 1 through 48

381
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.960
and are now well-versed
in subject-matter jurisdiction.

382
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.960
Who can tell us
about Gordon v. Steele?

383
00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.400
Let's call on someone
from the hot zone.

384
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:29.760
Elle Woods?

385
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.480
Actually, I wasn't aware
that we had an assignment.

386
00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.960
Vivian Kensington.

387
00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.680
Do you think it's acceptable
that Ms. Woods is not prepared?

388
00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.280
No.

389
00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.520
I don't.

390
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.720
Would you support my decision
to ask her to leave class

391
00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.200
and to return only
when she is prepared?

392
00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.160
Absolutely.

393
00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.760
Now, Ms. Kensington

394
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.960
did diversity jurisdiction exist
in this case?

395
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.920
No, it did not.

396
00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.240
Good. How about in the case
of Owens v. McCullogh?

397
00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.680
Excuse me, are you okay?

398
00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.200
Yeah.

399
00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.400
But do they just put you on the spot
like that, like, all the time?

400
00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.600
The professors? Yeah.
They tend to do that.

401
00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.680
Socratic method.

402
00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.560
So, if you don't know the answers,
they're just gonna kick you out?

403
00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.600
- So you have Stromwell, huh?
- Yes.

404
00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.680
- Did she do that to you, too?
- No.

405
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.200
But she did make me cry once.
I mean, not in class.

406
00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.576
I waited til I got back to my room

407
00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.360
but, yeah, she'll kick you
right in the ball.

408
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:20.800
Or wherever, you know.

409
00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.080
But, yeah, she's tough. Really tough.

410
00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.520
Great.

411
00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.881
Don't worry, though, it gets better.
Who else do you have?

412
00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.800
I have Callahan, Royalton,
and Levinthal.

413
00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.080
Yeah.

414
00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.040
Let's see,
speak up in Callahan's class.

415
00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.840
He really likes people
that are opinionated.

416
00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:37.920
Okay.

417
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.640
And in Royalton's class...

418
00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.720
try to get a seat in the back.

419
00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.520
He tends to spit when he talks
about products liability.

420
00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.600
And for Levinthal, you know,
make sure you read the footnotes

421
00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.080
'cause that's where he gets
a lot of his exam questions from.

422
00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:53.880
Right.

423
00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.160
I'm really glad I met you.

424
00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.040
Hey.

425
00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.360
Are you a third year?

426
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.480
- Well...
- Hey, Elle.

427
00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:06.800
Hi.

428
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.920
- Thanks for all your help.
- Good luck.

429
00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.640
- Hi, Warner.
- Hi.

430
00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.520
So, how was your first class?

431
00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.840
Oh, it was good,
except for this horrible preppy girl

432
00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.696
who tried made me look bad
in front of the professor.

433
00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.720
But no biggie.

434
00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.440
You're here now.
So, how was your summer?

435
00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.840
- Good. It was good.
- Did you do anything exciting?

436
00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:37.360
Hey. Have you met Vivian?

437
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.240
Oh, hi. Vivian Kensington.

438
00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:43.920
Do you know her?

439
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.920
- She's...
- I'm his fiancée.

440
00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.920
I'm sorry. I just hallucinated.

441
00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.560
What?

442
00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:02.280
Yeah, she was my girlfriend
in prep school.

443
00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.640
And, well, we got back together
this summer

444
00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.880
at my grandmother's birthday party.

445
00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.200
Warner told me all about you.

446
00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.920
You're famous at our club.

447
00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.600
But he didn't tell me you'd be here.

448
00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.720
Pooh bear,
I didn't know she would be here.

449
00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:22.840
Excuse me.

450
00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.280
Oh, thank God.

451
00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.000
Are you free? It's an emergency.

452
00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:00.760
Bad day?

453
00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.160
You can't even imagine.

454
00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:07.840
Spill.

455
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.320
I worked so hard
to get into law school.

456
00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.360
I blew off Greek week
to study for the LSATs.

457
00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:16.120
I even hired a Coppola
to direct my admissions video.

458
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.896
All to get my boyfriend Warner back.

459
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.640
And now he's engaged
to this awful girl Vivian

460
00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.120
so it was all for nothing, and I...

461
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:23.960
I just wish...

462
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.560
I just wish I had never
gone to Harvard.

463
00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.440
After you went to all that trouble.

464
00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.360
He's engaged.

465
00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:36.480
She's got the six-carat Harry Winston
on her bony, unpolished finger.

466
00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.280
What am I supposed to do?

467
00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.880
You're asking the wrong girl.

468
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.320
I mean, I'm with my guy eight years
and then one day

469
00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.560
it's "I met someone else. Move out."

470
00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.040
Oh, no.

471
00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.240
That's awful.

472
00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.360
Dewey kept the trailer
and my precious baby Rufus.

473
00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.800
I didn't even get to throw him
a birthday party.

474
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.880
No.

475
00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.400
I mean, what's a girl to do?

476
00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:10.440
He's a guy who followed his pecker
to greener pastures

477
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.400
and I'm a middle-aged
high-school dropout

478
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.720
who's got stretch marks
and a fat ass.

479
00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.520
- That's terrible.
- Yep.

480
00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.120
Happens every day.

481
00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.000
So what's this Vivian got
that you don't have?

482
00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.440
Three tits?

483
00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:29.600
She's from Connecticut.

484
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.400
She belongs
to his stupid country club.

485
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.080
Is she as pretty as you?

486
00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.440
She could use some mascara
and some serious highlights

487
00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.480
but she's not completely
unfortunate looking.

488
00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.600
- Hello, ladies.
- Hey, there.

489
00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.080
How you doing? Sign here.

490
00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.760
Oh, jeez. Look what I did.

491
00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.600
- See you later.
- Bye-bye, sugar.

492
00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.040
Oh, shit.

493
00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.400
Could I have been any
more goddamn spastic?

494
00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.240
It's okay.

495
00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.440
Are you sure
this Warner guy is, like...

496
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.200
the one?

497
00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.400
Definitely.

498
00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:14.840
I love him.

499
00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.200
Well, if a girl like you can't hold
on to her man

500
00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.320
then there sure as hell
isn't any hope for the rest of us.

501
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.480
What are you waiting for?

502
00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.880
Steal the bastard back.

503
00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.120
I should warn you that in addition
to competing against each other

504
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.160
for the top grade in this class

505
00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.080
you will also be competing
for one of my firm's

506
00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.520
highly coveted four internship
spots next year

507
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.920
where you will get to assist
on actual cases.

508
00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.480
Let the bloodbath begin.

509
00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.960
Now, let's commence
with our usual torture.

510
00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.040
Ms. Woods

511
00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.760
would you rather have a client
who committed a crime

512
00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.480
<i>malum in se</i> or <i>malum prohibitum?</i>

513
00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.360
- Neither.
- And why is that?

514
00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.400
I would rather have
a client who's innocent.

515
00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:22.040
Dare to dream, Ms. Woods.

516
00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.320
Ms. Kensington,
which would you prefer?

517
00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.080
<i>Malum prohibitum.</i>

518
00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.840
Because then the client
would have committed

519
00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:37.160
a regulatory infraction
as opposed to a dangerous crime.

520
00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:38.880
Well done, Ms. Kensington.

521
00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.520
You've obviously done your homework.

522
00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:46.480
Now let us look at <i>malum prohibitum</i>
a little more closely.

523
00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.600
It has been said... Yes, Ms. Woods?

524
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000
I changed my mind.

525
00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.320
I'd pick the dangerous one

526
00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.560
because I'm not afraid
of a challenge.

527
00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.320
Going inside.

528
00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:03.560
Right behind you, come on!

529
00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:05.960
- Come on...
- Coming through you!

530
00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.000
- That's great!
- Chad, make a hollow!

531
00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.320
Yo, bro.

532
00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.400
Who is that?

533
00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.640
Guys.

534
00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.040
- Can she play?
- Hi.

535
00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.680
Warner, do you know her?

536
00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.720
Get outta here.

537
00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.520
- Hey.
- Look at that.

538
00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.040
- Hi, everybody.
- Elle, what are you doing here?

539
00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.760
I've come to join your study group.

540
00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.000
And look, I brought sustenance.
Who's first?

541
00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.240
Our group is full.

542
00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.160
Oh, is this like an RSVP thing?

543
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.360
No. It's like a smart people thing.

544
00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.880
And as Viv said, we're full.

545
00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.760
Come on, guys, we can make room
for one more.

546
00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.120
We've already assigned the outlines.

547
00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:57.960
The answer is no.

548
00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.720
Oh, okay. I'll just leave, then.

549
00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:11.720
Bye.

550
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.760
Hey, maybe there's, like, a sorority

551
00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.360
you could, like, join instead, like?

552
00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.840
You know, if you had come
to a rush party

553
00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.440
I would have at least
been nice to you.

554
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.560
Is that before you voted against me

555
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.240
and then called me a dyke
behind my back?

556
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.080
I don't use that word.

557
00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.840
You must have heard it from Vivian.

558
00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.320
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey, it's me.

559
00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.760
It's Elle.

560
00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.240
Guess what I'm doing
right this second.

561
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.440
<i>I don't know. What?</i>

562
00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.600
I'm picking out my wedding dress!

563
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.160
- What?
<i>- Josh proposed.</i>

564
00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.640
Did you get the rock yet?

565
00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.160
Almost.

566
00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.160
Well, hurry up, so you can come home.

567
00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.240
We miss you.

568
00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.520
I miss you guys, too.
The people here are so vile.

569
00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.256
<i>Hardly anybody speaks to me unless...</i>

570
00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.280
Oh, my God.

571
00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.640
I almost forgot to tell you.

572
00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.200
- What?
- I got bangs.

573
00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.800
<i>My hair is so now.</i>

574
00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:32.880
- Really?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

575
00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:34.960
Okay, so just listen to me.

576
00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:38.040
<i>Keep June 1st open.
You're one of my bridesmaids</i>

577
00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:40.120
<i>and give Warner our love</i>

578
00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.800
because I'm getting married!
I'm getting...

579
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.080
So don't forget.

580
00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.360
Eight o'clock at 45 Dunston Street.

581
00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.760
- It'll be a really nice party.
- Okay, we'll be there.

582
00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.480
And don't forget
to bring your own merlot.

583
00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:01.800
- Okay.
- No way.

584
00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.160
Is somebody at this school
actually having a party?

585
00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.240
Yes.

586
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.920
But it's a costume party.
You probably wouldn't wanna come.

587
00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.520
I love costume parties.

588
00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.560
Well, then I guess
we'll see you there.

589
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Okay.

590
00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.160
Oh, at 45 Dunston Street.

591
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:25.960
Okay.

592
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.400
You won.

593
00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:44.880
Oh, my God.

594
00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.520
Hey.

595
00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.920
Thanks for inviting me, girls.
This party is super fun.

596
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:07.880
Nice outfit.

597
00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.000
I like your outfit, too.

598
00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.920
Except when I dress up
as a frigid bitch

599
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.680
I try not to look so constipated.

600
00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.880
- She's horrible.
- You've got the ring, sweetie.

601
00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.720
- Nice ears.
- How you doin'?

602
00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.840
Warner, Warner, the English language

603
00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.800
it is all about
subliminal domination.

604
00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.720
I mean, take the word semester. Okay?

605
00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.560
This is a perfect example
of this school's

606
00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.720
discriminatory preference
of semen to ovaries.

607
00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.600
That's why I'm petitioning
to have next term

608
00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.960
be referred to as the winter ovester.

609
00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.440
Excuse me. Hey, Warner.

610
00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.320
Well, don't you look
like a walking felony?

611
00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.960
Thank you. You're so sweet.

612
00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.840
- Are you having fun?
- I am now.

613
00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.080
What... What's with the costume?

614
00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.960
- I just decided to dress up.
- Really?

615
00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.696
You know, I feel like we barely
get to see each other

616
00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.720
since we've been here.

617
00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.800
Oh, I know. I'm so busy
with these case studies and hypos.

618
00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:05.880
I know what you mean.

619
00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.840
I can't imagine doing all this
and Callahan's internship next year.

620
00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.160
This is gonna be so much.

621
00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.880
Oh, Elle, come on,
you're never gonna get the grades

622
00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.360
to qualify for one of those spots.

623
00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.000
You're not smart enough, sweetie.

624
00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.400
Wait, am I on glue

625
00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.520
or did we not get into
the same law school, Warner?

626
00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.840
- Well, yeah, but...
- But what?

627
00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:29.720
We took the same LSATs,
and we're taking the same classes.

628
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.000
I know, but come on, Elle,
be serious.

629
00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:35.800
You can do something more valuable
with your time.

630
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.760
I'm never gonna be good enough
for you, am I?

631
00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.560
- Elle. Oh, come on.
- Just forget it.

632
00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.880
I'll show you how valuable
Elle Woods can be.

633
00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:09.600
- Don't ask.
- Wasn't gonna.

634
00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.560
I love that sweater. It's Chanel.

635
00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.520
Look.

636
00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:27.680
Was she carrying books?

637
00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.440
Thanks.

638
00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:41.480
So, you've filed a claim.

639
00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:43.960
What next?

640
00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:46.720
Ms. Woods?

641
00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:52.200
- Don't you need to have evidence?
- Meaning?

642
00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:58.680
Meaning you need reasonable belief
that your claim should have, like...

643
00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.920
evidentiary support?

644
00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:07.840
And what kind of evidentiary support
does this case require?

645
00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.800
Yo quiero, <i>Taco Bell.</i>

646
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.176
<i>Welcome back.
I'm talking with Frank Lucas</i>

647
00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.000
<i>Mark Jacobson, and Richard Roberts.</i>

648
00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.120
<i>Mark, in the article you talk about</i>

649
00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:26.320
<i>all sorts of things corrupt cops
who are wheeling and dealing...</i>

650
00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.800
And the purpose
of diminished capacity is?

651
00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.360
To negate <i>mens rea?</i>

652
00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.800
Are you ready?

653
00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:07.680
- No.
- Yes, yes, you are.

654
00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:09.880
Go. You can do this.

655
00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.760
Listen to me, Dewey.

656
00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.160
You shut your mouth.

657
00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.200
No, you shut your big mouth.

658
00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:21.000
I'm doing all the talking.

659
00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.600
What the hell do you want?
We're eating lunch.

660
00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.560
I just thought that...

661
00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.216
- Maybe we could...
- You just thought...

662
00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:40.536
You just thought you could come here

663
00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.280
and show me what
I'm definitely not missing?

664
00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.280
That's not why I came by.

665
00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.256
Hey, Paulette, how many times
you gonna come over here

666
00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.840
begging me to take you back, huh?

667
00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.400
I was...

668
00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:54.640
Dewey Newcombe?

669
00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:56.560
Who's asking?

670
00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.080
I'm Elle Woods.
Miss Bonifante's attorney.

671
00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.240
And I'm here to discuss
the legal situation at hand.

672
00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:05.360
Come again?

673
00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:08.760
Do you understand what
subject-matter jurisdiction is?

674
00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.880
- No.
- I didn't think so.

675
00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:14.400
Well, due to habeas corpus

676
00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:18.120
you and Miss Bonifante had
a common-law marriage

677
00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:22.320
which heretofore entitles her
to what is legally referred to

678
00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.000
as equitable division of the assets.

679
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:27.600
Come again?

680
00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:31.280
Due to the fact that you've retained
this residence

681
00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.800
Miss Bonifante is entitled
to full canine property ownership

682
00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:39.160
and will be enforcing said
ownership right now.

683
00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.240
Tell him, Paulette.

684
00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.560
I'm taking the dog, dumbass.

685
00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.840
- That's awesome.
- We did it.

686
00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:00.240
Come here.

687
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:02.880
Oh, my gosh, did you see him?

688
00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.520
He's probably still
scratching his head.

689
00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:06.920
Yeah, which must be a nice vacation
for his balls.

690
00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:17.840
Thank you.

691
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.680
Well, according to Swinney v. Neubert

692
00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.800
Swinney, who was also
a private sperm donor

693
00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:30.560
was allowed visitation rights
as long as he came to terms

694
00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.520
with the hours set forth
by the parents.

695
00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.360
So, if we're sticking
to past precedent

696
00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:37.240
I mean, Mr. Latimer wasn't stalking.

697
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.880
He was clearly within his rights
to ask for visitation.

698
00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:44.040
But Swinney
was a one-time sperm donor

699
00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:47.400
and in our case, the defendant
was an habitual sperm donor

700
00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:50.200
who also happens
to be harassing the parents

701
00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:51.480
in his quest for visitation.

702
00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.840
Well, yeah, but, I mean,
without this man's sperm

703
00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:57.320
the child in question wouldn't exist.

704
00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.040
Now you're thinking like a lawyer.

705
00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:05.120
Yes, Ms. Woods?

706
00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:08.640
Although Mr. Huntington
makes an excellent point

707
00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.600
I have to wonder if the defendant
kept a thorough record

708
00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.080
of every sperm emission
made throughout his life.

709
00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.760
Interesting. Why do you ask?

710
00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.720
Well, unless the defendant
attempted to contact

711
00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.200
every single one-night stand

712
00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:26.640
to determine
if a child resulted in those unions

713
00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:29.400
he has no parental claim
over this child whatsoever.

714
00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.240
Why now? Why this sperm?

715
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.600
I see your point.

716
00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.680
And for that matter

717
00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:37.760
all masturbatory emissions

718
00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:39.536
where his sperm
was clearly not seeking an egg

719
00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:41.040
could be termed reckless abandonment.

720
00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:44.920
I believe you've just won your case.

721
00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.800
- Ms. Woods, you did well today.
- Really?

722
00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:55.720
You're applying for my internship,
aren't you?

723
00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:58.320
- I don't know.
- You should.

724
00:46:58.520 --> 00:46:59.520
Do you have a resume?

725
00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.320
Yes, I do.

726
00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:06.720
Here it is.

727
00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:09.600
It's pink.

728
00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:10.680
Oh, and it's scented.

729
00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.296
I think it gives it
a little something extra

730
00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.320
don't you think?

731
00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.080
Okay, well, see you next class.

732
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.760
Do you think she woke up
one morning and said

733
00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.640
"I think I'll go
to law school today."

734
00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.720
That lapse in judgment aside,
I think she's got a lot of potential.

735
00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:31.960
Here's the Windham file.

736
00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:34.400
Smell this.

737
00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.080
- What's that?
- It's her resume.

738
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:41.600
Smells good.

739
00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:06.440
What's going on?

740
00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.960
Callahan's firm
is defending a murder trial.

741
00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.560
His caseload is so big,
he's taking on first year interns.

742
00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:15.680
- He picked them already?
- My God, I can't believe it, Warner.

743
00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:17.600
- We got it.
- Yes!

744
00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.720
That only leaves one for...

745
00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:28.520
Me!

746
00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:30.440
Yes!

747
00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:36.320
Warner?

748
00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.840
Do you remember when we spent
those four amazing hours

749
00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.440
in the hot tub after winter formal?

750
00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:47.480
Yeah, no.

751
00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:51.120
This is so much better than that.

752
00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.080
Excuse me.
I have some shopping to do.

753
00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:57.960
Four hours?

754
00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:19.920
You look very nice today, Vivian.

755
00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.840
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

756
00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:36.160
We're defending Brooke Windham

757
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.040
whose very wealthy husband

758
00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:40.400
was found shot to death
in their Beacon Hill mansion.

759
00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:41.720
Gold digger?

760
00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.720
You'd think so since the stiff was 60

761
00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.800
but she was rich on her own.

762
00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:47.360
Some kind of fitness empire.

763
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.600
You can buy her exercise tapes
on infomercials.

764
00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:52.040
Wait, are you talking
about Brooke Taylor?

765
00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:54.920
Maiden name, Taylor.

766
00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:58.440
- You know her?
- She's a Delta Nu.

767
00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:00.480
She wasn't in my pledge class
but she...

768
00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.160
She graduated four years before me.

769
00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.600
But I used to take her class
at the Los Angeles Sports Club.

770
00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.160
She's amazing.

771
00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:07.960
Amazing? How?

772
00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:10.640
She can make you lose, like,
three pounds in one class.

773
00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:11.880
She's completely gifted.

774
00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:15.040
Well, in all likelihood,
she's completely guilty, as well.

775
00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:18.040
She was seen standing
over her husband's dead body.

776
00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.360
By who?

777
00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:21.800
His 26-year-old daughter
and the pool boy.

778
00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:24.360
Sorry, I'm late. Excuse me.

779
00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.280
This is Emmett Richmond,
another associate

780
00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:28.600
top three in his class

781
00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.800
and former editor
of <i>Harvard Law Review.</i>

782
00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:34.000
You've probably seen him lurking
around campus doing my research.

783
00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:35.440
Thanks for the introduction.

784
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.680
- So, what about the murder weapon?
- Hi.

785
00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:39.280
The gun is missing.

786
00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:40.936
The coroner said
he'd been dead 30 minutes

787
00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:41.960
when the cops arrived

788
00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:44.040
giving Brooke plenty
of time to stash it.

789
00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.320
I just don't think Brooke
could have done this.

790
00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:50.040
Exercise gives you endorphins.
Endorphins make you happy.

791
00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.200
Happy people just don't shoot
their husbands.

792
00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:55.800
They just don't.

793
00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:57.720
I didn't do it.

794
00:50:58.680 --> 00:50:59.680
I walked in

795
00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.880
I saw my husband lying on the floor

796
00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:04.520
I bent down to check his heart,
screamed my head off

797
00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:06.096
and then Enrique and Chutney
ran inside.

798
00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.360
Okay, your step-daughter
and the pool boy came in

799
00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.760
where they saw you standing
over the body covered in his blood.

800
00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.440
Why would I kill my husband?

801
00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:19.760
Insurance, a love affair,
pure unadulterated hatred.

802
00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.200
Believe me, the DA
will come up with plenty of reasons.

803
00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:23.800
I loved him.

804
00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:30.560
He was 34 years older than you.
That doesn't look so good to a jury.

805
00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.440
Then show them a picture of his dick.

806
00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:34.760
That might clear a few things up.

807
00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:42.840
Brooke, I believe you,
but a jury is going to want an alibi.

808
00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:44.480
Well, I can't give you that

809
00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:47.600
and if you put me on the stand,
I'll lie.

810
00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:51.240
Well then, I guess we're done
for today.

811
00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:01.160
Hey.

812
00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:02.240
- Hi.
- I know you.

813
00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:05.560
I'm a Delta Nu,
and I'm a huge fan of yours.

814
00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:07.800
You took my class in LA.

815
00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:10.720
You had the best high-kick
I've ever seen.

816
00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:14.040
- Are you one of my lawyers?
- Yes. Sort of.

817
00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:16.760
Well, thank God
one of you has a brain.

818
00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:18.480
Let's go.

819
00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:26.000
I'm the only one that believes her.
Callahan totally thinks she's guilty.

820
00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:28.720
Yeah, that's because men
are big fat retards who don't...

821
00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:31.080
Afternoon, ladies.

822
00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:33.200
It's him.

823
00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:35.280
Paulette Bonifante.

824
00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:37.720
Oh, my God.

825
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.200
He's coming over here.

826
00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:46.320
I've got a package.

827
00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:51.280
He's got a package.

828
00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:06.720
- How you doing today?
- Fine.

829
00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.200
Take it easy.

830
00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:17.520
- See you later.
- Take it easy.

831
00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:20.320
That's great, Paulette.

832
00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.560
Is this the only interaction
you two have ever had?

833
00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:23.720
No.

834
00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:26.280
Sometimes I say
"okay" instead of "fine."

835
00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.080
Well, why don't you offer him
a cold beverage

836
00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:32.000
or a neck massage or something?

837
00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:34.000
Oh, come on. What's the point?

838
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:36.760
Trust me, Paulette,
you have all the equipment

839
00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:38.160
you just need to read the manual.

840
00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:40.880
Do you know what I'm saying?

841
00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:43.816
Okay, I'm gonna show you
a little maneuver

842
00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:45.400
that my mother taught me
in junior high.

843
00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:46.800
In my experience

844
00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:49.400
it has a 98% success rate
of getting a man's attention

845
00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:51.400
and when used appropriately

846
00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:54.560
it has an 83% rate of return
on a dinner invitation.

847
00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:58.400
It's called the "bend and snap."

848
00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.160
Watch this.

849
00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:06.160
I think I dropped something
on the floor that I need to pick up.

850
00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:09.480
So you bend... and snap.

851
00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.280
See?

852
00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.520
Come on. You try it.

853
00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:19.280
Bend and snap.

854
00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:20.880
Okay.

855
00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:23.720
Yeah. A little less bend,
a little more snap.

856
00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:25.280
- Okay?
- Like this?

857
00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:28.360
Good snap. Come on.

858
00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:33.400
You. Come on, you can do it.

859
00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:35.680
Bend and snap.

860
00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:37.520
Oh, yeah.

861
00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:38.760
- Yeah.
- Very good.

862
00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:39.840
We can all do it.

863
00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.960
- Come on, guys.
- No, I can't do that.

864
00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:45.800
You're gonna bend... and snap.

865
00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:47.160
Okay, now put your head into it.

866
00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.760
- Bend... and snap.
- Bend... and snap.

867
00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:52.480
- Bend... and snap.
- Bend... and snap.

868
00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.680
Good job. A little attitude, please.

869
00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:58.200
Now, everybody smile.
That's very important.

870
00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:01.120
Pump.

871
00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:03.160
Bend... and snap.

872
00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.160
Good job, everybody.

873
00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:08.000
Work it out. Work it out.

874
00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:09.880
That's it.

875
00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:13.440
Let's go. Come on, Paulette.

876
00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:19.200
- Bend... and snap.
- Oh, my God.

877
00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:22.200
The "bend and snap."
Works every time.

878
00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.280
Yeah.

879
00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:26.320
Well, if Brooke didn't kill the guy,
then who did?

880
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.240
My money is on the angry daughter
or the ex-wife.

881
00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:30.680
Chutney has a trust fund.

882
00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:33.080
She didn't need the insurance pay off
or the inheritance.

883
00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:34.160
What about the mother?

884
00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.696
Covered.
She was in Aspen at the time.

885
00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:36.960
Vivian, get me some plum sauce.

886
00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:39.520
Ten people saw her downing
cosmopolitans

887
00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:40.600
at the Caribou Club.

888
00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.480
All I know is it's not Brooke.

889
00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:45.280
That's touching, Elle,
but we need an alibi.

890
00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:52.200
I brought you some necessities,
some Calvin Klein 720-count sheets

891
00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:56.840
the entire Clinique skincare line,
some aromatherapy candles

892
00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:58.480
a loofah

893
00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:01.680
and the Bible.

894
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.000
You're an angel.

895
00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.360
So how are you? Are you all right?

896
00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:10.200
You look so orange.

897
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.480
I'm just glad that it's you
and not Callahan.

898
00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:16.360
He means well. He's very brilliant.

899
00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.320
Yeah, he better be
for what I'm paying for him.

900
00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:21.960
I have to tell you
the real reason I came here.

901
00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:24.960
Professor Callahan says
we really, really need your alibi.

902
00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:28.360
Elle, I can't.

903
00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:31.160
You don't understand.

904
00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:33.080
Who could understand better than me?

905
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.040
It's so shameful.

906
00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:39.160
Whatever it is, Brooke,
it could save you.

907
00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:41.360
No. That's just it. It would ruin me.

908
00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:43.400
How?

909
00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:49.840
I've made my fortune on the ability
to perfect women's bodies

910
00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:51.520
with Brooke's Butt-Buster workout.

911
00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:53.520
I know, you helped me go
from a six to a four.

912
00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.600
That's great.

913
00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:00.320
On the day of Heyworth's murder...

914
00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:06.880
I was getting...

915
00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:09.960
What?

916
00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:12.240
I was getting liposuction.

917
00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:15.160
Liposuction!

918
00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:17.720
- Oh, God.
- No.

919
00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:19.400
I know. I'm a fraud.

920
00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:21.960
It's not like normal women
can have this ass.

921
00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:25.440
If my fans knew that I bought it,
I would lose everything.

922
00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:29.280
I've already lost my husband.

923
00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:35.400
I'd rather go to jail
than lose my reputation.

924
00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:37.920
Brooke...

925
00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:40.000
your secret's safe with me.

926
00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:45.120
Thank you.

927
00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:48.640
Vivian, grab me some coffee.

928
00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:50.816
We got two interviews tomorrow

929
00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.400
that Gerard and Bobby
are gonna handle.

930
00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:53.640
The ex-wife in an hour.

931
00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:55.760
And according to this communique
from the prison

932
00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:58.720
our client apparently had a visit
from her sister...

933
00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:01.920
a Ms. Delta Nu.

934
00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:05.320
Anyone you know?

935
00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:07.600
Yes. I went to visit her.

936
00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.856
What the hell do you mean
you went to visit her?

937
00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:11.920
- I went to get her alibi.
- Did you get it?

938
00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:15.680
- It's really good.
- Well, great.

939
00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:17.320
What is it?

940
00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.040
I can't tell you.

941
00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:20.920
Why the hell not?

942
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.800
Because I promised her
I'd keep it a secret

943
00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:24.720
and I can't break the bonds
of sisterhood.

944
00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:26.040
Screw sisterhood.

945
00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:27.400
This is a murder trial

946
00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:29.400
not some scandal
at the sorority house.

947
00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:30.480
I want the alibi.

948
00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:35.000
I can't give it to you,
but I can tell you she is innocent.

949
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.880
Mr. Callahan, Mrs. Windham Vandermark
is on line two for you.

950
00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:41.760
Someone reason with her
while I take this.

951
00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:44.680
Are you crazy?

952
00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:46.720
- Just tell him the alibi.
- No.

953
00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.360
We're gonna lose this case
if you don't.

954
00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:50.000
Well, then we're not
very good lawyers.

955
00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:51.680
If you tell him,
he'll probably hire you

956
00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:52.760
as a summer associate.

957
00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:55.600
Who cares about Brooke?
Think about yourself.

958
00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:00.560
- I gave her my word, Warner.
- So what?

959
00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:07.200
The ex-wife seems to be unconcerned

960
00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.000
with the fact that
her interview is today.

961
00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:10.560
She's at a spa in the Berkshires.

962
00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:13.920
A spa? Isn't that
kind of like your mothership?

963
00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:16.160
I could go if you want me to.

964
00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:17.240
- Emmett?
- Yeah.

965
00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:19.440
- Go with her.
- Okay.

966
00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:32.600
She seems completely
untrustworthy to me.

967
00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:33.760
Why?

968
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.240
I mean, this is a person
who's made her living

969
00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:37.800
by telling women
that they're too fat.

970
00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:40.440
Brooke would never tell a woman
that she was too fat.

971
00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:42.840
And she seems to me
like she's hiding something.

972
00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:46.880
- Then maybe it's not what you think.
- Maybe it's exactly what I think.

973
00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:50.320
You know,
you're really being a butthead.

974
00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:53.440
A butthead?
Why would you call me that?

975
00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:56.176
You know, Emmett, you just need to
have a little more faith in people.

976
00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:57.240
You might be surprised.

977
00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.336
I can't believe you just called me
a butthead.

978
01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.960
I mean, no one's called me a butthead
since about the ninth grade.

979
01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:06.560
Maybe not to your face.

980
01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:10.920
So this is what a spa looks like.

981
01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:13.120
How do we find her?

982
01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.656
I called ahead.
She's in the mud room.

983
01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:17.160
She's not naked, is she?

984
01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.360
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?

985
01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.800
- So you found me.
- Yes.

986
01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.680
We're from Austen, Platt, Jaret,
and Callahan

987
01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.400
and we're here to ask you
a few questions.

988
01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:36.480
So I hear that that little tart
from California shot poor Heyworth.

989
01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:39.536
Well, that's what we're trying
to prove didn't happen, actually.

990
01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.400
Do you have any reason
to believe that it did?

991
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.920
Well, I've never actually met
the woman

992
01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:47.160
but my daughter tells me
she can be quite the little bitch.

993
01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.560
Now, did your daughter
ever mention anything to you

994
01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:53.240
about the relationship
between Brooke and Heyworth?

995
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.280
Well, she did say that
they humped like gorillas.

996
01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.920
I guess it wasn't enough,
though, for Brooke.

997
01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.080
Why do you say that?

998
01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:07.040
Well, haven't you seen
the cabana boy?

999
01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.320
She's lying.

1000
01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.160
And you know this for a fact?

1001
01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.560
Did you see the icky brown color
of her hair?

1002
01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.680
So?

1003
01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.640
Now you discriminate
against brunettes?

1004
01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:20.080
Why shouldn't I? I'm discriminated
against as a blonde.

1005
01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.680
You know, being a blonde
is actually a pretty powerful thing.

1006
01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.256
You hold more cards
than you think you do.

1007
01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:27.440
And I personally would like
to see you take that power

1008
01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:29.760
and channel it towards
the greater good, you know?

1009
01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.200
Thanks.

1010
01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.080
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

1011
01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.240
- Hey.
- Yeah?

1012
01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.200
How do you think
I'd look as a blonde, you know?

1013
01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.040
I'm not sure you could handle it.

1014
01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.640
- Good night.
- Bye.

1015
01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.560
So, I called your room last night.

1016
01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:55.760
I heard.

1017
01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:57.680
I was thinking maybe
we could go out sometime.

1018
01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.240
No. You're a dork.

1019
01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.280
I'm in law school.

1020
01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:06.400
Look, I'm not gonna go out with you.
I can't believe you'd even ask.

1021
01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.680
Girls like me don't go out
with losers like you.

1022
01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.080
Let's get out of here.

1023
01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:12.840
Excuse me.

1024
01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.960
- Why didn't you call me?
- What?

1025
01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:22.160
We spent a beautiful night together,
and I never hear from you again?

1026
01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:23.840
I...

1027
01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.480
I'm sorry?

1028
01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.240
Sorry for what? For breaking my heart

1029
01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.480
or for giving me
the greatest pleasure I've ever known

1030
01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.280
and then just taking it away?

1031
01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:37.400
Both?

1032
01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:38.680
Well, forget it.

1033
01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.720
I've spent too many hours
crying over you.

1034
01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:47.360
So, when did you wanna go out?

1035
01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.320
Come in.

1036
01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:01.960
Are you done
with that deposition yet?

1037
01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:05.880
Oh, yeah. Here, take it.
I've read it like 20 times.

1038
01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:08.520
Okay.

1039
01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:16.680
You know, Elle...

1040
01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:21.160
I still can't believe
you didn't tell Callahan the alibi.

1041
01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.160
- It's not my alibi to tell.
- I know.

1042
01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:29.600
And I thought
that was very classy of you.

1043
01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.760
- Really?
- Sure.

1044
01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.120
Thanks.

1045
01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:46.160
Did you ever notice how Callahan

1046
01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.760
never asks Warner
to bring him his coffee?

1047
01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:52.080
I mean, he's asked me
at least ten times.

1048
01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:54.160
Well, men are helpless.
You know that.

1049
01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:57.800
I know. Warner doesn't even do
his own laundry.

1050
01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.440
I know, he has to have it sent out.

1051
01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:01.360
I know.

1052
01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:05.440
Did you know when he first applied

1053
01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.160
he got wait-listed.

1054
01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:09.680
What?

1055
01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.880
His father had to make a call.

1056
01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:14.880
You're kidding.

1057
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.080
No way.

1058
01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.880
God, that is such a precious dog.

1059
01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.120
- Hi.
- His name is Bruiser.

1060
01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.200
Do you want to hold him?

1061
01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.520
- He's very friendly.
- Sure.

1062
01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.440
Look, he likes you.

1063
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:38.880
He's giving me kisses.

1064
01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.040
Thanks, Jeoff.

1065
01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.760
<i>We're here today covering
the trial of Brooke Windham.</i>

1066
01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:48.760
<i>Now, you may remember, she's charged
with the murder of her husband</i>

1067
01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.440
<i>Boston millionaire Heyworth Windham.</i>

1068
01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:54.040
<i>First to testify are the victim's
daughter and ex-wife.</i>

1069
01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.800
The Superior Court of Suffolk County
is now in session.

1070
01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:59.320
The Honorable Judge
Marina R. Bickford presiding.

1071
01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.400
You may be seated.

1072
01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.560
And where was she exactly?

1073
01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:13.000
Standing over my father's dead body.

1074
01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.560
And what was the defendant doing?

1075
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.680
Well, she was sitting
next to the pool, topless

1076
01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:22.840
while the Latin boy
handed her a drink.

1077
01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:29.000
Mr. Salvatore,
can you tell us what this is?

1078
01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:31.880
My uniform.

1079
01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:36.840
This is the uniform
that Mrs. Windham asked you

1080
01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:38.800
to wear while cleaning her pool?

1081
01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:43.080
Yes.

1082
01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.800
And are you or are you not having
an affair with Brooke Windham?

1083
01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:51.560
Define "affair."

1084
01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:55.360
Have you and Mrs. Windham
had sexual relations?

1085
01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.120
Yes, okay?

1086
01:05:58.680 --> 01:05:59.680
Yes.

1087
01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:06.560
Ladies and gentlemen,
court will reconvene

1088
01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.680
tomorrow morning at 9.00am.

1089
01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:10.160
We're adjourned.

1090
01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.016
You know a Delta Nu would never sleep
with a man who wears a thong.

1091
01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.040
Never.

1092
01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.800
I just liked watching him
clean the filter.

1093
01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.200
I know, I believe you, Brooke.

1094
01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:22.960
- Take care of me, Elle.
- I will.

1095
01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:43.880
I got a big one for you.

1096
01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:52.280
Can you sign?

1097
01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.640
I got it.

1098
01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.960
- You broke his nose?
<i>- Oh, I blew it, Elle.</i>

1099
01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.120
<i>My snap was all over the place.</i>

1100
01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.776
I'll be there right
as soon as court is out.

1101
01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.200
We have to cross-examine Enrique.

1102
01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.736
But don't worry. My girlfriend Serena

1103
01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:44.456
once barfed on a guy
during <i>The Blair Witch Project</i>

1104
01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.776
and they ended up dating
for three months.

1105
01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:47.960
<i>Really? All right. Bye-bye.</i>

1106
01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.040
Okay. Bye.

1107
01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:03.640
Don't stomp your little last-season
Prada shoes at me, honey.

1108
01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:06.800
These aren't last season.

1109
01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:17.160
Emmett he's gay. Enrique's gay.

1110
01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:18.840
- What?
- Warner.

1111
01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.200
What kind of shoes are these?

1112
01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:22.600
Black ones.

1113
01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:24.080
- See.
- What are you talking about?

1114
01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:27.360
He's gay. He isn't Brooke's lover.
He's making it up.

1115
01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:29.680
Wait. Back up.
How do you know that he's gay?

1116
01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:32.520
Gay men know designers.
Straight men don't.

1117
01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.040
Know what?

1118
01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:36.160
He did leave a Cher tape
in the pool house one time.

1119
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.560
While I appreciate
your masterful legal theory

1120
01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.040
I have a murder trial to attend to.

1121
01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:45.080
- Emmett.
- Okay.

1122
01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:49.800
- I'll take care of it. Thanks.
- Okay.

1123
01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:51.840
The court will come to order.

1124
01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:03.040
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof
that you and Mrs. Windham

1125
01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:04.640
were having an affair?

1126
01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:06.560
Only the love in my heart.

1127
01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:08.640
Well...

1128
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.280
if that's all the proof that he has,
Your Honor

1129
01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:12.360
I think I'm done here.

1130
01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:14.280
You may step down.

1131
01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:16.320
I'd like to ask a couple
of questions, Your Honor.

1132
01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:18.960
Just give me a couple minutes.

1133
01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:23.680
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham
on a date?

1134
01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:26.000
- Yes.
- Where?

1135
01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:28.440
A restaurant in Concord
where no one could recognize us.

1136
01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:30.576
And how long have you been sleeping
with Mrs. Windham?

1137
01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.600
Three months.

1138
01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:33.256
- And your boyfriend's name is...
- Chuck.

1139
01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:34.280
Right.

1140
01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:39.600
Silence.

1141
01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:42.040
- Pardon me. Pardon me.
- Yes, Mr. Salvatore?

1142
01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:45.160
I was confused.
You see, I thought you said friend.

1143
01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:46.680
- Chuck is just a friend.
- Oh, okay.

1144
01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:51.080
- You bitch.
- Chuck, wait.

1145
01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:54.600
Silence in my court.
Sit down, Mr. Salvatore.

1146
01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.760
Silence in my courtroom.

1147
01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.280
How did I miss that? You were great.

1148
01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:04.920
Silence in my courtroom.

1149
01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:07.840
Thanks.

1150
01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.320
- Good night.
- Good night.

1151
01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:20.080
Elle, Callahan asked to see you
before you leave.

1152
01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.440
- Really?
- Yeah, you know

1153
01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.600
he already has coffee,
but maybe he needs a doughnut.

1154
01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:24.840
Okay.

1155
01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.480
- Do you need any help?
- No. I'm fine.

1156
01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:27.560
Okay. Bye.

1157
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Come on in.

1158
01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:37.080
- Hi.
- Hi.

1159
01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:38.360
- Sit down.
- Okay.

1160
01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:47.920
Is everything all right?

1161
01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:50.400
You followed your intuition today

1162
01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.920
and you were right on target.

1163
01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:57.400
- I should have listened.
- Thank you.

1164
01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:00.600
About the alibi...

1165
01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:01.920
I'm sorry...

1166
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.400
I'm impressed you took the initiative
to go there and get it.

1167
01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.320
That's what makes a good lawyer.

1168
01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:09.280
And on top of that,
you gained the client's trust

1169
01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.440
and kept it,
that's what makes a great lawyer.

1170
01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.040
You're smart, Elle.

1171
01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.120
Smarter than most of the guys
on my payroll.

1172
01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.800
I think it's time to discuss
your career path.

1173
01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:26.200
Have you thought about where you
might be a summer associate?

1174
01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:31.000
Not really.
I know it's very competitive.

1175
01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.600
Well, you know what competition's
really about, don't you?

1176
01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:39.240
It's about ferocity, carnage.

1177
01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:44.560
Balancing human intelligence
with animal diligence.

1178
01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:50.560
Knowing exactly what you want
and how far you'll go to get it.

1179
01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:54.200
How far will Elle go?

1180
01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:01.200
- Are you hitting on me?
- You're a beautiful girl.

1181
01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:04.720
So everything you just said...

1182
01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.480
I'm a man who knows what he wants.

1183
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.496
And I'm a law student
who just realized

1184
01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:11.400
her professor is a pathetic asshole.

1185
01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:14.920
Too bad.
I thought you were a law student

1186
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.040
who wanted to be a lawyer.

1187
01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:36.000
- You almost had me fooled.
- What?

1188
01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:38.600
Well, maybe you should sleep
with the jury, too.

1189
01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:39.840
Then we can win the case.

1190
01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:56.800
- Hey.
- I'm quitting.

1191
01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Why?

1192
01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.200
Law school was a mistake.

1193
01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:01.760
This whole internship was a mistake.

1194
01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.520
What are you talking about?
You earned it.

1195
01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.000
I didn't earn anything, Emmett.

1196
01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:09.200
Callahan only gave me that internship
because he liked the way I looked.

1197
01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:11.880
Which he made clear tonight
when he tried to feel me up.

1198
01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.000
Callahan did what?

1199
01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:19.000
Just forget about it.
I'm going back to LA.

1200
01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:21.120
No more boring suits.
No more pantyhose.

1201
01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:23.040
No more trying to be something
that I'm just...

1202
01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:25.440
I'm just not.

1203
01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:28.720
What if you're trying
to be somebody you are?

1204
01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:31.800
The hell with Callahan.

1205
01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:35.600
Stay.

1206
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.840
Call me if you're ever
in California. Okay?

1207
01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.400
What's the point
in staying, Paulette? I mean...

1208
01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:04.560
All people see when they look at me
is blond hair and big boobs.

1209
01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.000
No one's ever
gonna take me seriously.

1210
01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.800
The people at law school don't.
Warner doesn't.

1211
01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:13.440
I don't even think my own parents
take me seriously.

1212
01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:20.840
I just felt, like, for the first time
that someone expected me to...

1213
01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:23.960
to do something more with my life

1214
01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:26.200
than just become
a Victoria's Secret model.

1215
01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:30.760
But I was just kidding myself.

1216
01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.400
Callahan never saw me as a lawyer.
He just saw me as a piece of ass.

1217
01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:36.360
Just like everybody else.

1218
01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:40.800
Turns out I am a joke.

1219
01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:44.400
No, you're not a joke.

1220
01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:53.880
The hell with law school.

1221
01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.120
I just wanted to say goodbye.

1222
01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.720
If you're going to let
one stupid prick ruin your life...

1223
01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.680
you're not the girl
I thought you were.

1224
01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:27.760
<i>Did you go in there</i>

1225
01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:29.656
<i>knowing how you're going to
discredit Mr. Salvatore?</i>

1226
01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:34.080
<i>Oh, absolutely. It's a little thing
I'd like to call strategy.</i>

1227
01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:37.360
<i>You know, I had a feeling
about Mr. Salvatore...</i>

1228
01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:38.920
Is he always such an ass?

1229
01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:41.240
He's the top defense attorney
in the state.

1230
01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:42.360
Of course he's an ass.

1231
01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:44.880
Fine. But is he an ass
that's gonna win my case?

1232
01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:47.520
Well, he's an ass that's gonna try.

1233
01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.920
- He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
- That's not what's important.

1234
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.040
If he doesn't trust me,
why should I trust him?

1235
01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:56.080
Ask Elle. She looked pretty cozy
with him last night.

1236
01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:59.200
You know, you don't even know
what the hell you're talking about.

1237
01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:02.480
What's going on here?

1238
01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:04.880
Elle quit.

1239
01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:06.280
- What?
- Yeah.

1240
01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:08.240
Callahan hit on her, so she quit.

1241
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000
My God.

1242
01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:12.280
Scumbag.

1243
01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.600
- Oh, God.
- What?

1244
01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:19.680
I feel terrible.
I made a huge mistake.

1245
01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.280
Well, maybe there's something
we can do about it.

1246
01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:33.840
Thank you.

1247
01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:41.200
What are you so happy about?
You're on trial for murder.

1248
01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:42.800
Get up.

1249
01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.000
- What?
- You're fired.

1250
01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:48.080
I have new representation.

1251
01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:50.640
Who?

1252
01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:13.920
Excuse you, you're in my way.

1253
01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:16.240
She's a law student.
She can't defend you.

1254
01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:21.360
Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court ruling 3.03.

1255
01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:22.720
See?

1256
01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:26.800
- Thank you, David.
- Counselors, approach the bench.

1257
01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:29.920
- You're not going up there.
- Oh, yes, I am.

1258
01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:31.640
I'm sorry, maybe you didn't hear me.

1259
01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:35.520
- You're fired.
- Counselors, now.

1260
01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:36.600
All of you.

1261
01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:42.120
Elle Woods, Your Honor.

1262
01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:45.360
Rule 3.03 of Supreme
Judicial Court states

1263
01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:47.000
that a law student
may appear on behalf

1264
01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:48.600
of a defendant
in criminal proceedings.

1265
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.840
Your Honor,
I have no problem with this.

1266
01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:52.160
I do. I'm not allowing it.

1267
01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:53.640
Oh, but you agreed last night.

1268
01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.440
In your office
when we were discussing my career.

1269
01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:02.240
The ruling also states that you need
a licensed attorney to supervise you.

1270
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.080
- Mr. Callahan?
- That I won't agree to.

1271
01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:07.680
I'll supervise, Your Honor.

1272
01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:12.920
- Well, then Ms. Woods, proceed.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1273
01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:20.800
- Hi.
- Hi.

1274
01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:28.240
Enjoy prison.

1275
01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:33.240
Mrs. Windham,
you do realize what you're doing?

1276
01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:34.640
Absolutely.

1277
01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:41.360
- Oh, my God. There she is, Elle.
- Elle, we came to see your trial.

1278
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.080
Oh, look how cute. There's, like,
a judge and everything.

1279
01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.680
And jury people.

1280
01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:50.000
- Vote for Elle!
- Ladies, take a seat.

1281
01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:51.840
Go, girl.

1282
01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.056
Do you swear to tell the truth

1283
01:18:58.080 --> 01:18:59.336
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth

1284
01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:00.360
so help you God?

1285
01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:01.440
- I do.
- Be seated.

1286
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.920
Ms. Woods,
you may begin your questioning.

1287
01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:12.856
First of all, I would like
to point out

1288
01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:15.600
that not only is there no proof
in this case

1289
01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:19.560
but there is a complete lack
of <i>mens rea</i>

1290
01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:23.400
which by definition tells us that
there can be no crime

1291
01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:25.400
without a vicious will.

1292
01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:29.120
I am aware
of the meaning of <i>mens rea.</i>

1293
01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:31.720
What I'm unaware
of is why you're giving me

1294
01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.000
a vocabulary lesson

1295
01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:35.160
when you should be
questioning your witness.

1296
01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:38.280
Yes, Your Honor.

1297
01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:43.080
Ms. Windham

1298
01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:48.240
when you arrived back at the house,
was your father there?

1299
01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:50.160
Not that I saw

1300
01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:53.000
but like I said, I went straight
upstairs to take a shower.

1301
01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:58.600
And when you came downstairs,
what happened?

1302
01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:01.840
I saw Brooke standing over his body

1303
01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:04.240
drenched in his blood.

1304
01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:12.480
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?

1305
01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:14.800
No. She'd stashed it by then.

1306
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.816
Move to strike that from the record,
Your Honor.

1307
01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.320
- It's speculation.
- So stricken.

1308
01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:22.120
Go ahead.

1309
01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.920
Ms. Windham,
did you hear a shot fired?

1310
01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:32.280
No. I was in the shower.

1311
01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:34.760
Okay.

1312
01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:40.200
So, sometime in the 20 minutes
that you were in the shower

1313
01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:42.080
your father was shot.

1314
01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:44.080
I guess.

1315
01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.240
Your father was shot
while you were in the shower

1316
01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:51.280
but you didn't hear
the shot because...

1317
01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:56.680
because you were in the shower?

1318
01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:00.840
Yes. I was washing my hair.

1319
01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:08.240
- Where is she going with this?
- Have a little faith, Gerard.

1320
01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:19.800
Ms. Windham,
what had you done earlier that day?

1321
01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:23.440
I got up, got a latte

1322
01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:26.200
went to the gym, got a perm,
and came home.

1323
01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:29.960
Where you got in the shower?

1324
01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:33.680
I believe the witness
has made it clear

1325
01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.680
that she was in the shower.

1326
01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:42.600
Yes, Your Honor.

1327
01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:46.680
Ms. Windham,
had you ever gotten a perm before?

1328
01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:49.720
- Yes.
- How many would you say?

1329
01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:53.160
Two a year since I was 12.

1330
01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.160
You do the math.

1331
01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:59.080
You know, a girl in my sorority,
Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once.

1332
01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:02.521
We all tried to talk her out of it.
Curls weren't a good look for her.

1333
01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:04.680
She didn't have your bone structure.

1334
01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:08.080
But, thankfully, that same day

1335
01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:10.200
she entered the Beta Delta Pi
wet t-shirt contest

1336
01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:12.216
where she was completely
hosed down from head to toe.

1337
01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:13.240
Objection.

1338
01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:16.840
- Why is this relevant?
- Oh, I have a point, I promise.

1339
01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:18.040
Then make it.

1340
01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:19.800
Yes, ma'am.

1341
01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:23.680
Chutney, why is it that
Tracy Marcinko's curls ruined

1342
01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:24.760
when she got hosed down?

1343
01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:28.280
- Because they got wet?
- Exactly.

1344
01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:30.776
Because isn't it the first
cardinal rule of perm maintenance

1345
01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:32.016
that you're forbidden
to wet your hair

1346
01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.000
for at least 24 hours
after getting a perm

1347
01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:36.520
at the risk of deactivating
the ammonium thioglycolate?

1348
01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:39.960
Yes.

1349
01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:41.800
And wouldn't somebody
who's had say 30 perms

1350
01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:44.240
before in their life
be well aware of this rule?

1351
01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:47.720
And if in fact you weren't washing
your hair as I suspect you weren't

1352
01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:50.680
because your curls are still intact,
wouldn't you have heard the gunshot?

1353
01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:52.640
And if in fact you had heard
the gunshot

1354
01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:54.520
Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time

1355
01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:56.520
to hide the gun
before you got downstairs

1356
01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:58.616
which would mean that
you would have had to have found

1357
01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:01.680
Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand
to make your story plausible.

1358
01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:03.960
- Isn't that right?
- She's my age.

1359
01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:05.160
Did she tell you that?

1360
01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:07.656
How would you feel if your father
married someone who is your age?

1361
01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:10.040
You, however, had time to hide
the gun, didn't you, Chutney?

1362
01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.400
After you shot your father.

1363
01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:12.640
I didn't mean to shoot him.

1364
01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:14.760
I thought it was you
walking through the door.

1365
01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:19.040
Order. Order.

1366
01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:21.480
Order.

1367
01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:25.000
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

1368
01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.560
Oh, my God.

1369
01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:30.640
Bailiff, take the witness
into custody

1370
01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:33.920
where she will be charged
for the murder of Heyworth Windham.

1371
01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:36.800
In the Matter of the State
v. Brooke Windham

1372
01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:38.760
this case is dismissed.

1373
01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:41.000
Mrs. Windham, you are free to go.

1374
01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:43.280
- Yes!
- Yes!

1375
01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:53.920
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

1376
01:23:58.080 --> 01:23:59.776
Elle, how did you know
that Chutney was lying?

1377
01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.176
Because she's brilliant, of course.

1378
01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:03.120
The rules of hair care
are simple and finite.

1379
01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:04.480
Any Cosmo Girl would have known.

1380
01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:11.000
- Elle...
- What?

1381
01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:15.480
I just wanted to say that
you were so brilliant in there.

1382
01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.840
And that I was wrong.

1383
01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:23.520
And you are the girl for me.

1384
01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:25.960
- Really?
- Yes.

1385
01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:29.800
Pooh bear, I love you.

1386
01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:32.640
Oh, Warner.

1387
01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.680
I've waited so long
to hear you say that.

1388
01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:40.720
But if I'm gonna be a partner
at a law firm by the time I'm 30

1389
01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:43.120
I need a boyfriend
who's not such a complete bonehead.

1390
01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:49.040
Thank you, boys.

1391
01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:56.880
Ladies and gentlemen

1392
01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:01.040
I present the graduates
of Harvard Law School

1393
01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:03.000
Class of 2004.

1394
01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:08.920
I am personally very honored
to introduce

1395
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.160
this year's class-elected speaker.

1396
01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:15.880
After getting off to a quite
interesting start here at Harvard

1397
01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:19.560
she graduates today
with an invitation to join

1398
01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:22.720
one of Boston's most
prestigious law firms.

1399
01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:27.160
I'm sure we are going
to see great things from her.

1400
01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:31.280
Ladies and gentlemen, Elle Woods.

1401
01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.880
On our very first day at Harvard

1402
01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:56.440
a very wise professor
quoted Aristotle.

1403
01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:00.040
"The law is reason free
from passion."

1404
01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:05.800
Well, no offense to Aristotle,
but in my three years at Harvard

1405
01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:09.320
I have come to find that passion
is a key ingredient

1406
01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:13.120
to the study and practice of law
and of life.

1407
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.080
It is with passion

1408
01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:18.520
courage of conviction,
and strong sense of self

1409
01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.640
that we take our next steps
into the world

1410
01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:24.360
remembering that first impressions
are not always correct.

1411
01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:28.280
You must always have faith in people

1412
01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:30.800
and most importantly...

1413
01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:36.240
you must always have faith
in yourself.

1414
01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:40.800
Congratulations, Class of 2004.

1415
01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:43.080
We did it.
