00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.397
Hey, this area's restricted.

2
00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:00.900
Hi. Yeah, I know.
They called me down here.

3
00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:02.777
Some of this wiring got screwed up.

4
00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:06.281
Nobody called it down to me.
I'm gonna have to see a work order.

5
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:08.236
Yeah. Just a second.

6
00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:13.659
There you are.

7
00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:17.670
Nothing personal.

8
00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:24.132
Well, I guess that wraps it up.
Good work, everybody.

9
00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:28.840
Marty, I couldn't be happier
with the way this worked out.

10
00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:34.220
Congratulations.

11
00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:40.026
Hold that.

12
00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:44.189
Gee, thanks.

13
00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.829
Thanks for pushing that, Bob.
The light's on,

14
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.660
but you never know, it might be broken.

15
00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:58.541
Shut up.

16
00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:15.554
Remember, honey...

17
00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:58.013
Jesus. Bob, what button did you push?

18
00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:49.026
Mr bagwell, make sure these other
elevators remain locked down and empty.

19
00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:53.744
There's no doors, no other way in or out,
except through access panels, correct?

20
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.995
What we have here are 13 passengers
in an express elevator below floor 30.

21
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.629
Bomb's taken out cables. Bomber wants
$3 million or he blows the brakes.

22
00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:07.423
- What's our clock?
- He gave one hour.

23
00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:11.010
That leaves us 23 minutes exactly.

24
00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:13.133
Anything to keep this
elevator from falling?

25
00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:14.423
The basement.

26
00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:16.508
We'd like to avoid that, traven.

27
00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:19.970
- We can't unload the passengers?
- This is an express elevator.

28
00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:24.104
The only way in is through access panels.
The bomber's wired the hatch,

29
00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:27.357
which seats him
in the "crazy but not stupid" section.

30
00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:30.814
Sir, Harry volunteers
to examine the device.

31
00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:34.777
- Yeah, right.
- Fine. The two of you check it out.

32
00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:37.863
The nearest access panel's
on the 32nd floor in the lobby.

33
00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.324
I want reports only.
We're in a holding pattern.

34
00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:42.704
Worthy, Briggs, secure the base area.

35
00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:45.913
Everyone else,
I want you to affirm building evac. Move!

36
00:07:46.967 --> 00:07:48.923
Looks like we're walkin'.

37
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.256
Hurry, but watch your step! 29.

38
00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:55.426
All the way down to the lobby!
Let's go, folks!

39
00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:57.469
30.

40
00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:00.764
31.

41
00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:04.393
32.

42
00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:27.458
Hello?

43
00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:32.460
- Come on! Get us outta here!
- Hello! Hello!

44
00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:08.711
Help! Please, get us out of here!

45
00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:11.126
Please!

46
00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:37.486
Please! Get us out of here!

47
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:44.323
Who's up there?
Who's up there? What's going on?

48
00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:47.117
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the LAPD.

49
00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:49.578
- Thank god.
- What are you doing up there?

50
00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:54.041
There's been an elevator malfunction,
so just relax.

51
00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:57.627
Hey, come on!
What are you guys waiting for?

52
00:09:57.722 --> 00:10:01.556
We'll have you out of there
as soon as possible.

53
00:10:01.684 --> 00:10:03.720
Am I lying?

54
00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:08.222
How come they sent cops here?
Shouldn't they send repair guys?

55
00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:17.814
What do you think?

56
00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:23.536
- You're the expert. I just work here.
- Looks pretty solid.

57
00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:28.416
- Anyone we know?
- I don't recognise the work, but he's a pro.

58
00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:32.749
- He's cutting it close.
- I don't like it.

59
00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:35.749
Well, what's to like?
Mac said we hold, so we hold.

60
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.638
All right, pop quiz.
The airport. Gunman with one hostage.

61
00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:52.189
He's using her for cover.
He's almost to a plane.

62
00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:55.727
You're 100 feet away.

63
00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:02.655
Jack.

64
00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:06.579
Shoot the hostage.

65
00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:09.499
- What?
- Take her out of the equation.

66
00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:13.704
Go for the good wound and he can't
get to the plane with her. Clear shot.

67
00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:17.586
You're deeply nuts, you know that?
"Shoot the hostage."

68
00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:24.931
Harry, this is wrong.
He's gonna blow it anyway.

69
00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:29.307
- Why?
- I don't know. Gut feeling.

70
00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:32.598
Right now Mac outranks your gut,
so we sit.

71
00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:36.522
This is taking way too long.

72
00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:39.529
How much d'you think
that elevator weighs?

73
00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:41.698
Jack, come on.

74
00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:46.285
Maybe we can do something
about those hostages.

75
00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:50.198
We're not gonna shoot 'em, right?

76
00:11:51.502 --> 00:11:54.619
Hey, where you going? What's going on?

77
00:11:56.216 --> 00:12:00.050
Don't go! Don't leave us here!

78
00:12:14.817 --> 00:12:17.729
No, we just take them out of the equation.

79
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.728
- Are you sure it'll hold?
- It'll hold.

80
00:12:55.024 --> 00:12:57.060
Six minutes.

81
00:12:57.193 --> 00:13:00.560
I can't get any more time.
He's not talking!

82
00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:02.858
I need the goddamn money now.

83
00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:16.375
Tell me again, Harry.
Why did I take this job?

84
00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:20.671
Oh, come on. 30 more years of this, you get
a tiny pension and a cheap gold watch.

85
00:13:20.758 --> 00:13:22.464
Cool.

86
00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:58.038
- God, it's hot in here.
- There's no air.

87
00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:01.121
- Can't they just pry the doors open?
- I can't breathe.

88
00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:08.211
Don't fuck with daddy.

89
00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:45.005
Usually they fall down now.

90
00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.972
He's early. The son of a bitch is early!

91
00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:18.698
Mac, we need more help up here now!

92
00:15:19.377 --> 00:15:22.835
Oh, please! I don't wanna die!

93
00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.037
Please save us!

94
00:15:30.346 --> 00:15:33.429
Open the door! Open the door, please!

95
00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:40.725
- Please help me!
- We'll get you out!

96
00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:45.851
- Give me your hands! It's ok.
- Pull me through.

97
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.611
Watch your head. Watch your head.

98
00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:59.618
- Ok, I've got you.
- Take it easy.

99
00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:02.451
- You're fine. You're fine.
- Thank you.

100
00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:04.376
Take her. Who's next?

101
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:08.630
Thank you.

102
00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:12.384
We've got you, ma'am.

103
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.302
- What the hell is all this?
- Help us! Hurry!

104
00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:27.559
Hurry, hurry! Let's go! Go! Go!

105
00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:29.314
Come on. Come on.

106
00:16:34.243 --> 00:16:36.859
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

107
00:16:36.954 --> 00:16:40.287
- Help me out! Please, help me out.
- Watch your head.

108
00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:43.032
- Come on, lady!
- No.

109
00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:45.834
Come on, lady! Come on! Grab my hand!

110
00:16:51.427 --> 00:16:54.635
- Come on! Let's go! It's going to fall!
- No!

111
00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:55.970
No, I can't!

112
00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:59.511
Just take one step, reach out
and take my hand.

113
00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:02.344
Come on! Come on!

114
00:17:05.441 --> 00:17:09.605
Oh, god! Don't let go of me!
You're ok.

115
00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:28.044
My shoe!

116
00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:31.463
Was it good for you?

117
00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:34.588
It was great for me.
How was it for you, honey?

118
00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:37.796
- Elevator dropped.
- Good. That's good to know.

119
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.687
- Is your watch slow?
- No. He jumped the gun.

120
00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:50.308
- We had three minutes left.
- Why does he do that?

121
00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:52.234
He's losing his $3 million.

122
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:55.154
Maybe he couldn't hold his wad
long enough.

123
00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:59.655
It's a common problem among
middle-aged men. So I'm told.

124
00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:06.293
He's here.

125
00:18:06.377 --> 00:18:09.619
He could've blown that thing
from pacoima.

126
00:18:09.714 --> 00:18:14.799
No. He knew we were up to something.
He's close by.

127
00:18:14.885 --> 00:18:20.096
He's not gonna corner himself in a building
we evacuated anyway. Come on.

128
00:18:25.396 --> 00:18:30.390
He'd wanna be here,
but he'd wanna stay mobile, right?

129
00:18:34.071 --> 00:18:35.902
The elevators.

130
00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:38.739
Passenger cars were stopped.
They checked 'em out.

131
00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:40.946
What about the freight elevators?

132
00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:09.266
Will the mystery guest please sign in?
“What?

133
00:19:11.442 --> 00:19:13.398
Jack!

134
00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:15.192
Damn it.

135
00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:58.269
Get to the side!

136
00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.462
Shit! Shit! Shit!

137
00:20:18.676 --> 00:20:20.883
Up! Get your ass up!

138
00:21:04.346 --> 00:21:09.181
I don't suppose anybody'll give me
three million just for you.

139
00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:15.937
Hold it!

140
00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:22.149
Pop quiz, hotshot.
Terrorist holding a police hostage.

141
00:21:22.239 --> 00:21:25.652
Got enough dynamite strapped to his chest
to blow a building in half.

142
00:21:25.743 --> 00:21:27.574
Now what do you do?

143
00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:30.740
There's gonna be 50 cops
waiting for you in the basement.

144
00:21:30.873 --> 00:21:33.034
Standard flanking deployment, right?

145
00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:40.122
Maybe we'll get off on the third floor,
huh? At least that's what they'll think.

146
00:21:40.382 --> 00:21:44.500
I want location on those goddamn shots!
Briggs! Where's Jack and Harry?

147
00:21:44.595 --> 00:21:48.087
Lieutenant, we've got movement
on the freight elevator.

148
00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:57.062
It's on three. Let's move!

149
00:21:59.902 --> 00:22:04.737
End of the line. This day has been
real disappointing, I don't mind saying.

150
00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:06.689
Because you didn't kill everyone?

151
00:22:06.784 --> 00:22:10.697
There will come a time, boy,
when you'll wish you'd never met me.

152
00:22:10.788 --> 00:22:12.824
Mister, I'm already there.

153
00:22:12.915 --> 00:22:19.252
I'm in charge here. I drop this stick
and they pick your friend up with a sponge.

154
00:22:23.926 --> 00:22:28.340
In 200 years, we've come from "I regret
but I have one life to give for my country"

155
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:29.545
to "fuck you"?

156
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.803
- Go ahead. Drop the stick. Do it.
- Shut up, Harry.

157
00:22:32.935 --> 00:22:36.098
We've got all the balls
in the world right here, man.

158
00:22:36.188 --> 00:22:38.304
Give it up. You got nowhere to go!

159
00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:40.980
Shoot the hostage.

160
00:22:44.113 --> 00:22:45.444
Say goodbye, Harry.

161
00:22:50.828 --> 00:22:52.113
You fuck!

162
00:22:54.832 --> 00:22:55.947
Freeze!

163
00:22:57.626 --> 00:22:58.991
Freeze!

164
00:22:59.128 --> 00:23:02.040
Give it up! You're out of options!

165
00:23:25.362 --> 00:23:30.072
Through dedication and bravery,
these next two officers effected the rescue

166
00:23:30.159 --> 00:23:32.571
of 13 citizens of this city.

167
00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:37.659
And, thanks to them, the only life taken
by the terrorist's bomb was his own.

168
00:23:38.042 --> 00:23:40.454
You shot me. I can't believe it.

169
00:23:40.544 --> 00:23:43.707
They're giving you a medal
for shooting me, you little prick.

170
00:23:43.839 --> 00:23:47.252
Harry, you told me to.

171
00:23:47.343 --> 00:23:49.834
The Los Angeles police department.

172
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.762
Officer Harry temple.

173
00:24:08.864 --> 00:24:10.354
Officer Jack traven.

174
00:24:27.883 --> 00:24:30.465
Way to go, Jack. Way to go.

175
00:24:31.261 --> 00:24:33.547
- There we go.
- Harry, my man.

176
00:24:33.639 --> 00:24:37.678
Beautiful. A toast to me.
Make me feel good about myself.

177
00:24:37.768 --> 00:24:40.510
Hey, Sandy! Here we go!

178
00:24:40.604 --> 00:24:42.765
Ok, so how we doing? Whoa, whoa.

179
00:24:42.898 --> 00:24:45.890
Shit. I need a bib!

180
00:24:47.736 --> 00:24:51.069
- Here we go. All right.
- You can't take me anywhere.

181
00:24:51.907 --> 00:24:54.444
And here is to Harry,

182
00:24:55.244 --> 00:24:57.576
for his quick thinking,

183
00:24:58.414 --> 00:25:02.783
for his grace under pressure
and for his brave and selfless act.

184
00:25:03.252 --> 00:25:05.288
Hear! Hear!

185
00:25:06.422 --> 00:25:10.256
And to Jack, for shooting Harry.

186
00:25:10.968 --> 00:25:14.301
Something we've all wanted to do
for a very long time.

187
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:16.967
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

188
00:25:17.099 --> 00:25:19.090
Ok, no, no. Here it is.

189
00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:23.803
Here's to you guys for doing your job
and for not getting dead.

190
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.681
Mazel tov.

191
00:25:36.035 --> 00:25:38.492
We are the two luckiest guys in the world.

192
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.532
We got the bad guy
and we didn't lose any civilians.

193
00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:43.872
- We're good.
- No. You were lucky.

194
00:25:43.959 --> 00:25:47.747
No, we were lucky.
You'd better understand it.

195
00:25:47.838 --> 00:25:50.500
We were dealing with a total psycho.

196
00:25:50.632 --> 00:25:53.715
This guy could've blown us up at any time.

197
00:25:54.636 --> 00:25:57.127
And I got a bullet in me.

198
00:25:57.639 --> 00:26:01.757
Six inches off the Mark,
and they're giving the medal to my wife.

199
00:26:01.852 --> 00:26:05.185
Harry, come on, man.
I mean, we won. We got him.

200
00:26:05.314 --> 00:26:08.181
Do you listen? Do you ever?

201
00:26:08.317 --> 00:26:13.027
Because I am not gonna be around to
back you up, so you better start thinking.

202
00:26:14.823 --> 00:26:18.532
Guts'll get you so far,
and then they'll get you killed.

203
00:26:21.914 --> 00:26:24.872
Luck runs out sooner or later.
Right, chief?

204
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.536
That's right.

205
00:26:29.338 --> 00:26:33.923
I'm all right. I'm all right.
I'm gonna go home, have some sex.

206
00:26:36.512 --> 00:26:40.676
- Harry, you're gonna go home and puke.
- Yeah, well, that'll be fun, too.

207
00:26:41.934 --> 00:26:44.220
Come on, you gimp.

208
00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:09.208
Hey, Jack, saw you on TV. Congratulations.

209
00:27:09.294 --> 00:27:10.294
Thanks, Bob.

210
00:27:10.379 --> 00:27:12.745
- You looked fat.
- Take it easy on him, Bob.

211
00:27:12.881 --> 00:27:16.123
- The boy was up late last night partying.
- Wild party, huh?

212
00:27:16.218 --> 00:27:18.083
I don't remember that well.

213
00:27:18.178 --> 00:27:20.544
Couldn't have been too great.
Woke up alone.

214
00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:25.724
Yeah? The last time I partied like that,
I woke up married, huh, Vinnie?

215
00:27:26.562 --> 00:27:28.678
Hey, Jack, you forgot your muffins.

216
00:27:28.772 --> 00:27:31.980
- Have a good one, Bob.
- Thanks, Jack. Take care.

217
00:27:32.151 --> 00:27:33.391
Thanks.

218
00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:47.905
See you tomorrow.

219
00:29:04.743 --> 00:29:06.699
What do you think, Jack?

220
00:29:06.828 --> 00:29:11.743
You think if you pick up all the bus driver's
teeth, they'll give you another medal?

221
00:29:11.833 --> 00:29:12.833
Jesus!

222
00:29:12.918 --> 00:29:15.500
You think I wouldn't have been prepared?

223
00:29:15.587 --> 00:29:18.920
Two years I spent setting up
that elevator job.

224
00:29:19.007 --> 00:29:21.339
Two years I invested myself in it.

225
00:29:22.177 --> 00:29:25.294
You couldn't understand
the kind of commitment that I have.

226
00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:28.631
You ruined a man's life's work
and you think you can walk away?

227
00:29:28.725 --> 00:29:33.845
You got blinders on to the world, but I
got your attention now, didn't I, Jack?

228
00:29:33.939 --> 00:29:38.683
- Why didn't you just come after me?
- This is about me. This is about my money.

229
00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:42.736
This is about money due me,
which I will collect.

230
00:29:42.864 --> 00:29:45.025
$3.7 million.

231
00:29:45.534 --> 00:29:49.527
It's my nest egg, Jack.
At my age, you gotta think ahead.

232
00:29:50.038 --> 00:29:52.620
- When I find you...
- Pop quiz, hotshot.

233
00:29:52.708 --> 00:29:55.495
There's a bomb on a bus.

234
00:29:55.585 --> 00:29:59.794
Once the bus goes 50 miles an hour,
the bomb is armed.

235
00:29:59.881 --> 00:30:03.840
If it drops below 50, it blows up.

236
00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:07.302
What do you do? What do you do?

237
00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:12.383
- I'd wanna know what bus it was.
- You think I'm gonna tell you that?

238
00:30:13.228 --> 00:30:15.469
- Yes.
- Very good.

239
00:30:15.564 --> 00:30:18.977
There are rules, Jack,
and I want you to get this right.

240
00:30:19.067 --> 00:30:21.524
No one goes off the bus.

241
00:30:21.611 --> 00:30:25.650
You try to take any passengers off the bus,
I will detonate it.

242
00:30:25.741 --> 00:30:28.232
I want my money by 11am.

243
00:30:30.412 --> 00:30:33.996
- We can't pull that kind of money in time.
- Focus, Jack!

244
00:30:34.082 --> 00:30:39.122
Your concern is the bus.
And don't try to call. The radio's down.

245
00:30:39.796 --> 00:30:45.336
Now, the number of the bus is 2525.
It's running downtown from venice.

246
00:30:45.761 --> 00:30:49.674
It is at the corner of ocean park and main.

247
00:31:03.612 --> 00:31:04.647
Sam!

248
00:31:06.031 --> 00:31:07.111
Sam!

249
00:31:07.199 --> 00:31:08.609
Annie.

250
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.565
Sam! Tell him to stop!

251
00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.777
Shit. Excuse me. Coming through! Sam!

252
00:31:16.375 --> 00:31:18.787
- Sam!
- This ain't no bus stop.

253
00:31:18.877 --> 00:31:21.084
- Come on.
- Get rid of your butt, Annie.

254
00:31:21.171 --> 00:31:23.787
Ok, it's gone, it's gone.

255
00:31:23.882 --> 00:31:28.967
You are a good, kind man. One day
people are gonna write songs about you.

256
00:31:48.532 --> 00:31:52.821
- First time in la.
- Oh, no. I live here.

257
00:31:53.161 --> 00:31:56.278
No, I mean mine. Oh, that's just funny.

258
00:31:56.373 --> 00:31:59.331
- You heard me wrong. I'm sightseeing.
- Oh, really?

259
00:31:59.418 --> 00:32:03.582
Yeah. I hate to use the word "tourist",
but it's not like I can hide it.

260
00:32:04.089 --> 00:32:05.704
Not really.

261
00:32:08.677 --> 00:32:12.841
Aw, jeez. You know, it took me three hours
just to get here from the airport.

262
00:32:12.931 --> 00:32:14.546
I got so lost.

263
00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:19.009
La is one large place. Course, you
live here. You probably don't notice.

264
00:32:19.104 --> 00:32:22.642
I'm such a yokel. There. I said it.

265
00:32:22.732 --> 00:32:26.099
You know what? I got gum on my seat.

266
00:32:26.194 --> 00:32:27.479
Gum.

267
00:32:30.073 --> 00:32:31.529
Excuse me.

268
00:32:33.535 --> 00:32:34.695
- Morning.
- Hi.

269
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:41.057
I just couldn't handle
the freeways any more.

270
00:33:41.144 --> 00:33:43.226
I got so tense.

271
00:33:43.313 --> 00:33:46.305
This way, I can just relax
all the way to work.

272
00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:50.275
Yeah, well, I love my car. I miss my car.

273
00:34:03.041 --> 00:34:05.123
Oh, god. Look at that.

274
00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:08.956
- Hey, Sam!
- Shit.

275
00:34:09.047 --> 00:34:10.878
Sam! “What?

276
00:34:10.966 --> 00:34:13.082
Why don't you just drive over
these people?

277
00:34:13.176 --> 00:34:15.713
Don't spit on my bus, Annie.

278
00:34:16.805 --> 00:34:17.965
Such a mess.

279
00:34:34.406 --> 00:34:35.521
Stop!

280
00:34:41.204 --> 00:34:44.867
- Open up!
- Get off the door. This ain't no bus stop.

281
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.037
- That guy really wants to get on the bus.
- Open up! Stop!

282
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:50.831
- Don't, Sam! Don't let him on!
- LAPD!

283
00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:52.913
- I can't hear you!
- Stop this bus!

284
00:34:53.008 --> 00:34:54.919
What?

285
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:57.968
LAPD! Stop the bus!

286
00:34:58.054 --> 00:35:00.511
LAPD!

287
00:35:03.518 --> 00:35:05.600
Stop! Stop!

288
00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:10.059
- Stop! LAPD! Get out of the car.
- Jesus, not again.

289
00:35:10.191 --> 00:35:13.683
This is my car. I own this car.
It's not stolen.

290
00:35:14.195 --> 00:35:16.527
- It is now. Move over.
- Fuck!

291
00:35:16.615 --> 00:35:19.448
Man, you scratch this puppy,
and me and you

292
00:35:19.534 --> 00:35:22.196
are gonna have words, you understand?

293
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:45.049
Ok, look, man, we don't have to go so fast.
Just slow down a little bit.

294
00:35:46.061 --> 00:35:49.224
Oh, shit. Come on, man.

295
00:35:49.314 --> 00:35:52.397
Just don't tear up my car, all right?

296
00:35:53.485 --> 00:35:57.023
Ok, ok. Just slow down
just a bit, all right?

297
00:35:57.113 --> 00:36:00.901
We don't have to go so fast, do we?
We don't have to go so...

298
00:36:03.328 --> 00:36:06.070
That was a nice move, man.

299
00:36:17.967 --> 00:36:20.253
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

300
00:36:20.345 --> 00:36:22.961
The least you could do is slow down.
Come on.

301
00:36:23.598 --> 00:36:25.759
Oh, shit.

302
00:36:26.601 --> 00:36:28.182
Oh, shit!

303
00:36:30.146 --> 00:36:31.352
Move! Move!

304
00:36:34.192 --> 00:36:36.478
Is that that guy?

305
00:36:36.611 --> 00:36:39.023
Man sure has a hard-on for this bus.

306
00:36:54.337 --> 00:36:57.044
Hey! I'm a cop!

307
00:36:57.549 --> 00:36:58.789
What?

308
00:36:59.634 --> 00:37:01.044
I'm a cop!

309
00:37:01.136 --> 00:37:05.220
LAPD! There's a bomb on your bus!

310
00:37:08.727 --> 00:37:11.890
There's a... what? Fuck!

311
00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:16.019
There's a bomb on your bus!
Watch the road!

312
00:37:16.151 --> 00:37:18.483
Grab that. I want you to write on it.

313
00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:21.528
I want you to write on the back:
"Bomb on bus."

314
00:37:23.324 --> 00:37:24.814
Write it, write it, write it!

315
00:37:40.592 --> 00:37:42.332
Watch the road. Oh, shit.

316
00:37:55.523 --> 00:37:56.683
Oh, shit!

317
00:37:57.108 --> 00:37:58.518
No!

318
00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:00.475
Don't slow down!

319
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.782
No! No, no, no, no, no!

320
00:38:08.369 --> 00:38:10.360
Speed up!

321
00:38:12.248 --> 00:38:14.364
Open your door!

322
00:38:14.459 --> 00:38:16.871
Open the doors!

323
00:38:19.631 --> 00:38:21.872
50! Stay above 50!

324
00:38:22.383 --> 00:38:24.089
All right?

325
00:38:28.431 --> 00:38:32.265
4708000. Ask for detective Harry temple.

326
00:38:34.938 --> 00:38:36.849
Harry.

327
00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.056
Harry, it's Jack.

328
00:38:42.779 --> 00:38:45.737
You better not be calling in sick,
cos I dragged my ass...

329
00:38:45.824 --> 00:38:48.657
Harry, he's alive. “What?

330
00:38:48.743 --> 00:38:50.984
The bomber. He's back.

331
00:38:51.079 --> 00:38:54.321
He hit one in venice already.
There's nothing left.

332
00:38:54.415 --> 00:38:57.907
We got a ransom demand from your
dead terrorist. Says he's rigged a bus.

333
00:38:58.002 --> 00:39:00.163
- Where's Jack?
- Where do you think?

334
00:39:00.255 --> 00:39:03.292
- I gotta get on that bus.
- You gotta get...

335
00:39:03.424 --> 00:39:05.506
Yeah, yeah. You get on the bus.

336
00:39:05.593 --> 00:39:07.834
Drive straight!

337
00:39:07.929 --> 00:39:09.965
Stay in this Lane!

338
00:39:10.807 --> 00:39:11.922
Watch the road.

339
00:39:15.603 --> 00:39:18.185
Wait a minute. What are you doin'?

340
00:39:18.273 --> 00:39:20.605
- Are you insured?
- Yeah! Why?

341
00:39:21.776 --> 00:39:23.516
No! No!

342
00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:29.818
You broke my door.

343
00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:34.615
- Sir, I need to take your phone.
- Take the phone.

344
00:39:35.707 --> 00:39:38.540
Take the wheel. “What?

345
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.826
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

346
00:39:47.635 --> 00:39:48.875
Drive straight.

347
00:39:54.976 --> 00:39:56.967
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

348
00:40:02.358 --> 00:40:03.438
Oh, shit!

349
00:40:06.738 --> 00:40:08.820
Shit!

350
00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.035
This guy's out of his mind.

351
00:40:25.924 --> 00:40:28.916
Ok, listen, you gotta stay above 50.

352
00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:33.003
Excuse me, are you out of your mind?
“Whatever it takes.

353
00:40:34.182 --> 00:40:37.094
Everybody, I'm Jack traven, LAPD.

354
00:40:37.352 --> 00:40:40.560
We have a slight situation on the bus.
If you'll please sit down.

355
00:40:40.688 --> 00:40:44.601
- You're scaring the shit out of these people.
- Ma'am, please!

356
00:40:47.904 --> 00:40:51.817
If everybody will stay in your seats
and remain calm,

357
00:40:52.283 --> 00:40:55.025
we should be able to defuse the problem...

358
00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:57.531
Get away from me!

359
00:41:01.751 --> 00:41:05.664
I don't know you, man.
I'm not here for you. Let's not do this.

360
00:41:05.755 --> 00:41:07.336
- Stop the bus!
- He can't.

361
00:41:07.423 --> 00:41:10.540
Shut up! Stop the bus! Stop it!

362
00:41:10.635 --> 00:41:12.717
Listen!

363
00:41:13.888 --> 00:41:16.220
Look, I'm putting my gun away, ok?

364
00:41:18.726 --> 00:41:19.932
Ok?

365
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:27.190
Now, listen. I don't care about your crime.

366
00:41:27.276 --> 00:41:33.738
Whatever you did, I'm sure that you're
sorry, so it's cool now. It's over.

367
00:41:38.746 --> 00:41:41.237
And I'm not a cop right now.

368
00:41:42.917 --> 00:41:47.126
See? We're just two cool guys,
just hanging out...

369
00:41:51.592 --> 00:41:52.627
Sam!

370
00:41:57.348 --> 00:42:00.761
I've got the wheel! I've got it!
Sam! Oh god, Sam!

371
00:42:06.274 --> 00:42:10.438
You've gotta move your legs.
Can somebody move his legs?

372
00:42:12.113 --> 00:42:15.446
Sam, get your foot off the pedal!

373
00:42:16.034 --> 00:42:19.947
- I gotta stop this thing!
- No! Don't! Stay above 50!

374
00:42:20.038 --> 00:42:24.281
- Sam's been shot! We gotta get him off!
- You slow down and this bus'll explode!

375
00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.582
There is a bomb on this bus.

376
00:42:33.676 --> 00:42:36.463
If we slow down, it'll blow.

377
00:42:37.805 --> 00:42:41.889
If anyone tries to get off, it'll explode.

378
00:42:41.976 --> 00:42:44.467
Bullshit! Yeah, there's a bomb.

379
00:42:44.562 --> 00:42:47.770
- Some funny joke, man.
- Are we gonna have a problem now?

380
00:42:47.857 --> 00:42:50.940
He's bleeding so much.
I don't know what to do.

381
00:42:51.027 --> 00:42:56.522
Put pressure front and back, keep
his legs up and put this under his head.

382
00:42:56.657 --> 00:42:59.524
- Hold on, man.
- Sam, lift your head.

383
00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:03.152
- Can you handle this bus?
- Sure. It's like driving a really big pinto.

384
00:43:03.247 --> 00:43:07.331
- I need to know! Can you handle it?
- I'm fine. Just tell me what the plan is.

385
00:43:08.836 --> 00:43:11.623
- Is there a plan?
- For you to drive. We're ok for now.

386
00:43:11.714 --> 00:43:14.046
- Just keep us above 50.
- Good plan.

387
00:43:17.512 --> 00:43:20.094
- So, you're a cop, right?
- That's right.

388
00:43:20.181 --> 00:43:24.595
Well, I should probably tell you that
I had my driver's licence revoked.

389
00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:28.011
- What for?
- Speeding.

390
00:43:31.859 --> 00:43:35.852
Harry, we're on our way to the chopper.
If anything changes, let us know.

391
00:43:35.947 --> 00:43:38.859
Anything we haven't seen
should be in here.

392
00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:13.223
Wrong with the driver,
but at least one car, a Jaguar,

393
00:44:13.317 --> 00:44:16.354
has been driven off the road
by the speeding bus.

394
00:44:17.572 --> 00:44:21.030
The bus came onto the freeway
at the Lincoln onramp.

395
00:44:21.117 --> 00:44:24.951
It began picking up speed, swerving,
and hasn't slowed down since.

396
00:44:25.079 --> 00:44:27.821
Minutes ago a police officer
boarded the bus

397
00:44:27.915 --> 00:44:30.327
by jumping onto it from a moving car.

398
00:44:30.418 --> 00:44:33.080
Would that be you, Jack?

399
00:44:34.088 --> 00:44:36.204
- Where do we start?
- The speedometer.

400
00:44:36.299 --> 00:44:40.508
Has it been fucked with or loosened?
See any wires or anything?

401
00:44:40.595 --> 00:44:42.460
Excuse me, ma'am.

402
00:44:42.597 --> 00:44:44.633
No, it's clean.

403
00:44:44.765 --> 00:44:48.223
Then it's gonna be under the bus.
Probably rigged to one of the axles.

404
00:44:48.311 --> 00:44:51.599
I can't get under the bus right now.
It's kind of in motion.

405
00:44:51.689 --> 00:44:54.021
Excuse me! Excuse me!

406
00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:56.144
Hold on.

407
00:44:56.277 --> 00:44:59.019
Access panel... in the floor.

408
00:45:00.198 --> 00:45:02.280
Underneath you, man.

409
00:45:04.493 --> 00:45:06.700
All right, Harry. We're in.
Passenger relay.

410
00:45:06.787 --> 00:45:10.621
Sir, take this.
I want you to tell him what I see.

411
00:45:12.376 --> 00:45:14.162
Ok.

412
00:45:14.295 --> 00:45:16.786
We got a wad! Pretty big!

413
00:45:17.215 --> 00:45:19.752
- There's a pretty big wad.
- Brass fittings!

414
00:45:19.842 --> 00:45:23.209
- Brass fittings.
- I think I can reach the circuit wire.

415
00:45:23.304 --> 00:45:27.718
- He can reach the circuit wire.
- No, don't. That's a decoy. Classic.

416
00:45:27.808 --> 00:45:29.799
- Classic decoy.
- What else?

417
00:45:29.894 --> 00:45:32.101
- What else?
- Hold on.

418
00:45:32.188 --> 00:45:34.304
Hold on.

419
00:45:43.199 --> 00:45:44.530
Fuck me!

420
00:45:46.911 --> 00:45:48.151
Oh, darn.

421
00:45:50.998 --> 00:45:54.786
Harry, there's enough c4 on this thing
to put a hole in the world.

422
00:45:54.877 --> 00:45:57.869
Ok, all right. Just stay calm. What else?

423
00:45:58.005 --> 00:46:01.418
Three triggers -one on the axle
I can't really see, a cellular remote

424
00:46:01.509 --> 00:46:03.591
and a timer running off a wristwatch.

425
00:46:05.388 --> 00:46:07.800
- A watch? What kind of watch?
- Gold.

426
00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:09.846
Gold band. Fairly cheesy.

427
00:46:10.184 --> 00:46:12.470
Officer!

428
00:46:12.561 --> 00:46:14.973
- Officer!
- What's on your mind, Harry?

429
00:46:15.064 --> 00:46:17.271
Shit. What do I do? Officer!

430
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:19.519
- What do I do?
- Oh, shit.

431
00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:22.272
- Which way? Which way?
- Get on the shoulder.

432
00:46:22.363 --> 00:46:23.443
Ok.

433
00:46:36.544 --> 00:46:37.544
Watch it!

434
00:46:45.219 --> 00:46:48.677
Stay on or get off? Stay on or get off?

435
00:46:48.764 --> 00:46:51.756
Offl off! Hold on!

436
00:47:09.285 --> 00:47:10.946
Oh, god.

437
00:47:16.584 --> 00:47:18.870
- Keep going.
- It's red!

438
00:47:18.961 --> 00:47:21.498
Gol gol

439
00:47:36.145 --> 00:47:37.851
This is much better.

440
00:47:40.316 --> 00:47:45.185
City streets. The bus is on western,
heading in a southbound direction.

441
00:47:45.279 --> 00:47:49.318
Now, where the bus did exit here,
it had a couple of close calls.

442
00:47:49.408 --> 00:47:52.115
Yeah! Yeah! All right!

443
00:47:53.162 --> 00:47:55.528
We don't know what authorities plan to do.

444
00:48:04.507 --> 00:48:06.213
I don't get it.

445
00:48:07.051 --> 00:48:10.669
The watch is a shitty timer.
Why use it? What's he saying?

446
00:48:10.805 --> 00:48:14.093
- Lots of people have watches, Harry.
- This guy has no mo.

447
00:48:14.183 --> 00:48:17.971
A bomber falls in love with one kind
of bomb and they're very monogamous.

448
00:48:18.062 --> 00:48:21.646
This guy uses c4, dynamite,
different trigger every time,

449
00:48:21.732 --> 00:48:23.438
and now he throws in this watch.

450
00:48:23.526 --> 00:48:26.484
He's an encyclopaedia of bombs.
He knows every kind.

451
00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:29.687
Yeah, and everything we do to dismantle it.

452
00:48:31.826 --> 00:48:33.908
Wait a minute.

453
00:48:34.912 --> 00:48:37.619
I wanna look at the files
for the last 10 years.

454
00:48:37.706 --> 00:48:42.075
- We did the mug shots. It's not gonna help.
- No. I wanna look at cops.

455
00:48:42.878 --> 00:48:44.994
Come on. Let's go.

456
00:48:51.011 --> 00:48:53.718
Yeah. Mac, where have you been?

457
00:48:53.848 --> 00:48:56.635
I had to bail on the freeway.
We're in the city.

458
00:48:56.725 --> 00:48:59.933
I can see you. Just keep going straight.

459
00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:03.888
I'm gonna try to clear the roads for you.
Just stay on line.

460
00:49:07.528 --> 00:49:09.985
Shit! Oh, Jesus! God! No!

461
00:49:10.072 --> 00:49:11.107
Go left!

462
00:49:12.199 --> 00:49:15.111
- Sorry.
- Oh, my god!

463
00:49:23.544 --> 00:49:24.624
Oh, jeez!

464
00:49:27.047 --> 00:49:30.505
People, stay out of my way!
Stay out of my way!

465
00:49:30.593 --> 00:49:34.427
- Ma'am, up to the right.
- Ok, ok, ok. I see it, I see it.

466
00:49:41.228 --> 00:49:44.436
Mac! Mac, you've gotta get me outta here!

467
00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:51.899
A few more blocks,
you're gonna come up to a soft turn. Right.

468
00:49:51.989 --> 00:49:55.197
Then hold straight. I've got
some units waiting for you there.

469
00:49:55.284 --> 00:50:00.278
They're gonna lead you to the 105 freeway.
It's not in use. It'll be empty.

470
00:50:00.414 --> 00:50:03.121
- You'll be totally clear.
- Got it

471
00:50:06.587 --> 00:50:10.330
in a few blocks,
we take the soft turn to the right.

472
00:50:13.427 --> 00:50:16.919
Ok. Wait a minute. Escort to where?
Where do we get an escort to?

473
00:50:17.014 --> 00:50:19.096
Look out!

474
00:50:21.101 --> 00:50:22.261
Oh, god!

475
00:50:27.983 --> 00:50:29.393
Son of a bitch!

476
00:50:29.485 --> 00:50:32.022
Oh, Jesus! Oh, god!

477
00:50:33.948 --> 00:50:37.782
- Oh, god! I just hit the baby!
- Cans!

478
00:50:37.868 --> 00:50:41.986
- There was no baby. It was full of cans.
- Are you sure?

479
00:51:02.059 --> 00:51:03.970
Oh, jeez. No! No! No!

480
00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:16.358
- Why aren't they at school?
- Mac, we're boned.

481
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:18.321
I'll get you out, Jack.

482
00:51:27.876 --> 00:51:30.913
All right, listen.
You got an entrance coming up, Jack.

483
00:51:31.005 --> 00:51:33.792
It's gonna be a real ugly turn, though.

484
00:51:33.882 --> 00:51:35.998
- How ugly?
- What's ugly?

485
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:40.002
We got a hard right coming up
at the construction site.

486
00:51:40.723 --> 00:51:43.556
- This should be it.
- That is a dead end.

487
00:51:43.684 --> 00:51:48.053
- I can't make that turn.
- You can make it. Keep left. Make it wide.

488
00:51:48.188 --> 00:51:51.430
Oh, god. We're gonna tip over.
We're gonna tip over.

489
00:51:51.525 --> 00:51:55.438
You're right. We're gonna tip over.
Everyone on this side of the bus now!

490
00:51:55.529 --> 00:51:58.362
On this side of the bus!
As far as you can, please.

491
00:51:58.449 --> 00:52:00.531
Hold on!

492
00:52:00.618 --> 00:52:05.908
Over here. Over here. As far as you can!
Now! Mac, you better clear this site out.

493
00:52:13.255 --> 00:52:15.496
- Everybody hold on!
- This side of the bus!

494
00:52:15.591 --> 00:52:17.752
Hold on!

495
00:52:19.386 --> 00:52:23.550
Hold on! Oh, god! Here we go! Here we go!

496
00:52:26.644 --> 00:52:28.225
Here we go!

497
00:52:43.243 --> 00:52:46.076
Oh, my god!
Oh, god! Is everybody all right?

498
00:52:46.163 --> 00:52:48.404
- Yes!
- Oh, my god.

499
00:52:48.499 --> 00:52:51.161
Take me to that interchange at the 105.

500
00:53:01.762 --> 00:53:05.926
Oh, my god. We might've died.
I can't think.

501
00:53:06.016 --> 00:53:09.679
It's ok. If you need to,
you go right ahead and vomit.

502
00:53:28.122 --> 00:53:32.286
Frank, get rid of that scaffolding
and replace it with webbing.

503
00:53:32.376 --> 00:53:36.369
Norwood, I want aerial units up ahead.
No obstructions in the freeway.

504
00:53:36.463 --> 00:53:40.001
We have a window here.
I wanna make sure it stays open.

505
00:54:01.155 --> 00:54:02.361
Shoot.

506
00:54:03.574 --> 00:54:07.237
Could you do me a favour
and hold the wheel for me for a second?

507
00:54:07.327 --> 00:54:09.739
Hold the wheel? Thank you.

508
00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:12.242
Ma'am, you did very well.

509
00:54:12.332 --> 00:54:15.950
Actually, you were incredible.
I've never seen driving like that.

510
00:54:16.044 --> 00:54:17.750
Annie. What?

511
00:54:17.838 --> 00:54:19.703
It's my name. Annie.

512
00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:23.457
- Annie.
- As opposed to "ma'am".

513
00:54:23.552 --> 00:54:25.088
Ok.

514
00:54:28.599 --> 00:54:32.057
So, why is all this happening?

515
00:54:32.186 --> 00:54:36.805
I mean, what did we do?
Bomb the guy's country or something?

516
00:54:36.899 --> 00:54:39.606
No. It's just a guy who wants money.

517
00:54:41.028 --> 00:54:44.395
I don't buy that.
It's not a very good way to make money.

518
00:54:45.699 --> 00:54:49.237
So... what is this guy's deal?

519
00:54:50.871 --> 00:54:53.783
A while back,
he held some people for ransom.

520
00:54:53.874 --> 00:54:57.082
It went sour,
and now he's a little pissed at me.

521
00:54:57.211 --> 00:55:01.295
- What does that have to do with us?
- Nothing. It's a game.

522
00:55:01.381 --> 00:55:04.919
If he gets the money, he wins.
If the bus blows up, he wins.

523
00:55:05.052 --> 00:55:07.668
- What if you win?
- Tomorrow we'll play another one.

524
00:55:07.763 --> 00:55:10.880
But I'm not available
to drive tomorrow. Busy.

525
00:55:15.062 --> 00:55:17.428
We got no match for that description.

526
00:55:17.564 --> 00:55:20.180
No one's lost a thumb
for at least the last 10 years.

527
00:55:20.275 --> 00:55:23.608
- He could be from anywhere.
- I can't access all that.

528
00:55:23.737 --> 00:55:26.900
Forget the files.
Start going through the pension fund.

529
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:30.824
This guy's drawing disability. He may not
be LAPD, but he's living here now.

530
00:55:30.911 --> 00:55:33.994
I want pictures! I've seen this asshole.

531
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:51.678
Hey! Let's get these passengers
off the bus!

532
00:55:51.765 --> 00:55:52.845
We can't do it, sir!

533
00:55:52.933 --> 00:55:54.764
There's no time for any stunts.

534
00:55:54.852 --> 00:55:56.843
We gotta get these people
out of harm's way.

535
00:55:56.937 --> 00:56:00.304
I got orders.
We move these people, he'll see.

536
00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:05.226
Remember: Crazy, not stupid.

537
00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:09.734
Harry's trying to find out who this guy is.
We think maybe he's a cop.

538
00:56:09.825 --> 00:56:12.487
Lieutenant, it's him.

539
00:56:12.619 --> 00:56:15.986
- He wants to talk to Jack.
- He's on the line for you.

540
00:56:16.123 --> 00:56:19.991
- Ok, give him the number.
- Give him the number.

541
00:56:22.671 --> 00:56:25.083
- How's he doing?
- The bleeding is less, but...

542
00:56:25.173 --> 00:56:28.791
- Are they going to help us?
- Sure they are. They're the police.

543
00:56:28.886 --> 00:56:33.676
Hey, your taxes are paying their salary.
If we die, they gotta take a pay cut.

544
00:56:36.518 --> 00:56:38.133
I mean, you know.

545
00:56:41.565 --> 00:56:42.645
Yeah.

546
00:56:42.733 --> 00:56:43.973
I think we have trust,

547
00:56:44.318 --> 00:56:48.402
but it looks on TV like you're trying
to get those passengers off.

548
00:56:48.655 --> 00:56:52.022
- Look, you've gotta let me have one.
- We went over the rules.

549
00:56:52.159 --> 00:56:53.159
As an act of faith.

550
00:56:53.243 --> 00:56:56.076
We have an injured man here.
The driver's been shot.

551
00:56:56.163 --> 00:56:58.870
Tell me you haven't
been shooting the passengers.

552
00:56:58.999 --> 00:57:03.663
I thought it was customary
for a police officer to shoot the bad guys.

553
00:57:04.004 --> 00:57:07.838
- This man has no time.
- No one gets off.

554
00:57:07.925 --> 00:57:10.758
It'll grease the wheels
with the money men.

555
00:57:10.844 --> 00:57:13.130
There's still gonna be
plenty of us to kill.

556
00:57:14.222 --> 00:57:17.339
Ok, son, you can try and unload the driver.

557
00:57:17.434 --> 00:57:21.768
You tell that wildcat behind the wheel
not to slow down, though,

558
00:57:21.855 --> 00:57:26.440
or he won't even get a chance
to bleed to death. And, Jack, don't slip.

559
00:57:27.903 --> 00:57:32.237
- He's letting us unload the driver.
- Norwood! Get us closer!

560
00:57:33.617 --> 00:57:35.903
- We're gonna get the driver off.
- Just him?

561
00:57:36.036 --> 00:57:38.243
- For now. Gigantor.
- Ortiz.

562
00:57:38.372 --> 00:57:42.331
Ortiz, we're gonna need your help.
I need you to pass him to me.

563
00:57:42.417 --> 00:57:44.783
Keep him straight, or the wound'll tear.

564
00:57:44.878 --> 00:57:48.621
- What about the rest of us?
- Hey, hey, hey! Lady!

565
00:57:50.384 --> 00:57:52.466
I can't stay!

566
00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:56.632
- How are you feeling?
- Like I've been shot.

567
00:57:56.723 --> 00:57:58.805
- Take care, Sam.
- Ok, Annie.

568
00:57:59.768 --> 00:58:02.384
Drive straight!

569
00:58:05.315 --> 00:58:09.433
- Get as close as you can, ok?
- All right.

570
00:58:09.569 --> 00:58:13.061
Closer. A little closer, Annie.

571
00:58:14.783 --> 00:58:16.899
- Annie, a little closer.
- Ok.

572
00:58:19.079 --> 00:58:21.570
Ok, how's this?

573
00:58:23.250 --> 00:58:25.411
Sorry. Sorry.

574
00:58:25.502 --> 00:58:29.086
Ok, Annie. No problem.
Let's try it one more time.

575
00:58:30.132 --> 00:58:31.668
A little more!

576
00:58:31.758 --> 00:58:34.921
Ok! Ok! Right there!
Steady! Hold it steady!

577
00:58:36.179 --> 00:58:38.761
You got him? You got him?

578
00:58:45.605 --> 00:58:48.017
I'm all right. Thanks.

579
00:58:48.108 --> 00:58:50.599
Oh, my god. Yes!

580
00:59:00.287 --> 00:59:02.323
He's gonna be ok.

581
00:59:05.167 --> 00:59:07.453
Come on! Come on, lady.
Give me your hand.

582
00:59:07.544 --> 00:59:10.286
- I have to, Annie.
- No, Helen!

583
00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:12.587
- No, Helen, no!
- Come on!

584
00:59:12.674 --> 00:59:13.754
Helen, no! No!

585
00:59:13.842 --> 00:59:15.833
I'm here at the 105 freeway,

586
00:59:15.927 --> 00:59:19.294
where the police have successfully
led the runaway bus...

587
00:59:22.017 --> 00:59:23.473
No, Helen!

588
00:59:38.909 --> 00:59:42.242
Goddamn it, Mac!
Get those fucking choppers outta here!

589
00:59:42.329 --> 00:59:45.617
Was driving the bus.
Well, I couldn't tell how old...

590
00:59:45.707 --> 00:59:48.574
An explosion. Some kind of an explosion.

591
00:59:48.668 --> 00:59:51.751
The bus hasn't exploded, but... oh, my god.

592
00:59:51.838 --> 00:59:56.252
A woman caught in the blast fell. She was
pulled under the wheels. This is terrible.

593
00:59:56.343 --> 01:00:00.586
Interactive TV, Jack.
Wave of the future, huh?

594
01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:24.534
I can't be here.

595
01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:28.072
I can't, you know...

596
01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:31.207
This is the wrong bus.

597
01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:33.376
I mean, for me to...

598
01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:37.171
I can't die here.

599
01:00:37.259 --> 01:00:39.375
Hey, shut up, man.

600
01:00:40.554 --> 01:00:42.920
- I got a wife.
- Oh, you do?

601
01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:47.595
Hey! So if you have a wife and I donft,
does that mean I'm expendable?

602
01:00:47.727 --> 01:00:49.968
What are you talking about, man?

603
01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:52.270
The guy's just talking crazy.

604
01:00:52.399 --> 01:00:55.357
He gets on my nerves.
He gets on everybody's nerves.

605
01:00:55.443 --> 01:01:00.983
- I think I have the right to be a little upset.
- What are you staring at, anyway?

606
01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:03.941
Why don't you let us all die in peace,
if it has to happen?

607
01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:08.912
Oh, so you're a really tough guy, huh?
Why don't we just step outside?

608
01:01:08.999 --> 01:01:10.079
Hey!

609
01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:27.589
How are you doing? You all right?

610
01:01:28.476 --> 01:01:30.592
What can I do?

611
01:01:32.147 --> 01:01:33.887
When that bomb went off...

612
01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:36.685
I know.

613
01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:41.645
I thought that was it. I thought that was
the bomb, and I was dead.

614
01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:44.944
And then when I saw her body fall
under the bus, it was like...

615
01:01:46.161 --> 01:01:48.652
You were glad you were still alive.

616
01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:53.497
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.

617
01:01:53.627 --> 01:01:56.118
You should be glad. We all are.

618
01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:01.294
- It doesn't mean you don't care.
- I know, but she was so scared.

619
01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:04.592
She was a nice lady
who didn't deserve to get killed,

620
01:02:04.679 --> 01:02:07.762
but if she'd gotten off,
it would have killed us all.

621
01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:12.309
He's the asshole, Annie. The guy
who put us here. Remember that, ok?

622
01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.931
Big asshole.

623
01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:17.142
Ok.

624
01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:22.398
Are you sure?

625
01:02:22.489 --> 01:02:24.571
Well, how far?

626
01:02:27.494 --> 01:02:29.655
Sir, we have a serious problem.

627
01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:32.196
What?

628
01:02:32.332 --> 01:02:36.371
- This freeway isn't finished.
- What are you talking about?

629
01:02:36.503 --> 01:02:41.167
The aerial unit caught it. About three
miles ahead there's a section missing.

630
01:02:41.925 --> 01:02:44.007
A section missing?

631
01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:52.925
But it's on the map.
It's finished on the goddamn map!

632
01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:55.101
I guess they fell behind.

633
01:02:56.606 --> 01:03:00.190
Fuck! You're fired.
Everybody's fucking fired!

634
01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:03.814
Get me closer!

635
01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:06.772
Hey, get closer. Watch him in the mirror.

636
01:03:07.534 --> 01:03:09.616
Jack!

637
01:03:11.871 --> 01:03:15.534
- How big is the section?
- 50 feet... at least.

638
01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.043
There's a gap in the road up ahead.
It's big.

639
01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:28.593
- You're kidding. How big?
- 50 feet.

640
01:03:28.722 --> 01:03:30.132
What?

641
01:03:30.223 --> 01:03:32.635
We gotta get these people
off the bus somehow.

642
01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:34.341
You know I can't.

643
01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:38.386
What did he say? Jack?

644
01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:42.140
Jack, what did he say?

645
01:03:43.737 --> 01:03:45.193
What's the matter?

646
01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:54.160
There's a gap in the freeway.
“What?

647
01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:57.993
- What do you mean?
- How big is a gap?

648
01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:01.201
50 feet. A couple of miles ahead.

649
01:04:01.296 --> 01:04:03.412
This is crazy.

650
01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:10.293
Jeez. Jack.

651
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:14.173
Jack. What if I shift into neutral
and just keep the engine revving?

652
01:04:14.267 --> 01:04:17.930
- No, he'd have thought of that.
- What, then? What? What?

653
01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:21.304
What? Jack?

654
01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:22.931
Floor it. “What?

655
01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:26.359
Floor it. It's an interchange.
There might be an incline.

656
01:04:26.446 --> 01:04:28.186
Fine.

657
01:04:30.992 --> 01:04:34.701
Everybody hold onto your seats
or whatever you can.

658
01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:37.871
When we hit the gap, heads down.

659
01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:40.289
That's it? That's it?

660
01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:45.497
That's all we can do. Let's put these
underneath your seat, all right?

661
01:04:45.632 --> 01:04:48.123
Put your bags underneath the seat.

662
01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:56.223
- Hey, I didn't mean to shoot the guy.
- Hold on.

663
01:04:57.394 --> 01:05:00.227
Is this really gonna work?

664
01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:01.644
Jack.

665
01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:04.977
Yeah?

666
01:05:06.194 --> 01:05:07.354
Jack.

667
01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:32.042
- Come on, come on, come one.
- Oh, god.

668
01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:34.419
- Come on!
- Oh, god.

669
01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:44.891
Oh, shit.

670
01:05:58.371 --> 01:06:01.078
Everybody hold on!

671
01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:20.386
Oh, god. Jack.

672
01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:28.731
Shit!

673
01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:54.587
Yes! We are way out of control!

674
01:07:02.101 --> 01:07:03.341
You ok? Yeah.

675
01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:05.017
- You ok?
- I'm ok.

676
01:07:05.104 --> 01:07:08.346
All right! Norwood, let's go!

677
01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:11.308
Is everybody ok? Yes!

678
01:07:14.489 --> 01:07:16.480
We did it!

679
01:07:16.616 --> 01:07:18.777
We made it.

680
01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:21.530
You're the man. You are the man!

681
01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:24.287
Thank you. Thank you very much.

682
01:07:26.292 --> 01:07:27.828
Oh, shit.

683
01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:30.794
I think you missed your calling.
Yeah? What was it?

684
01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:34.793
Watch the road.
You should have been a pilot.

685
01:07:42.684 --> 01:07:43.924
Get off. “What?

686
01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:46.976
Get off this. Now. Get off this.

687
01:07:52.318 --> 01:07:53.979
In there.

688
01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:55.981
Where? Right here? Yeah.

689
01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:57.482
Right here? Yeah.

690
01:08:13.506 --> 01:08:17.124
- He's just entered the airport.
- There's thousands of people there.

691
01:08:17.218 --> 01:08:20.551
That's my boy Jack. He can circle
the runways and buy us some time.

692
01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:25.470
- Choppers can't fly there. It's restricted.
- He's headed for the end of the field.

693
01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:29.894
- Bravo tango, an emergency runway.
- Let's hope it's built. Let's move!

694
01:08:43.202 --> 01:08:45.693
We're at the airport.

695
01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:47.870
Yeah? So?

696
01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:51.032
I already seen the airport.

697
01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:15.815
Yeah? Very, very exciting, Jack.

698
01:09:15.902 --> 01:09:20.145
Some close calls, huh?
But you've done all right for yourself.

699
01:09:20.239 --> 01:09:23.447
- What do you want?
- I want money, Jack.

700
01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:29.697
I wish I had some loftier purpose, but I'm
afraid in the end it's just the money, Jack.

701
01:09:29.791 --> 01:09:36.412
I would like large non-sequential bills
in two clear plastic bags, unmarked.

702
01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:40.833
- Can you remember all that?
- What are you telling me for?

703
01:09:40.927 --> 01:09:44.169
Because I want you to help me
to get it before it gets too late.

704
01:09:44.263 --> 01:09:48.131
I hate negotiators, Jack. They talk to you
like they're your best friend

705
01:09:48.267 --> 01:09:50.303
and they don't even know you.

706
01:09:50.436 --> 01:09:54.805
Why are they messing with me, huh?
Do they think I'm doing this for fun?

707
01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:58.308
- Aren't you?
- Oah, that's unfair, Jack.

708
01:09:58.444 --> 01:10:02.813
You don't know how I feel about this.
You don't even know me.

709
01:10:02.949 --> 01:10:05.315
You want a shitload of money
you didn't earn.

710
01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:06.941
Oh, I earned it.

711
01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:09.945
I spent my life earning it.

712
01:10:10.289 --> 01:10:15.704
I got a medal, too, Jack, a medal and
a pink slip and a "sorry about your hand”.

713
01:10:15.795 --> 01:10:18.958
- You have to let me off.
- Oh, no.

714
01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:21.915
- That's not good.
- You want me to help you?

715
01:10:22.009 --> 01:10:25.718
I need to talk to these people face
to face. They think you're bullshit.

716
01:10:25.805 --> 01:10:27.887
They don't think that.

717
01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:30.431
Look, you want the money,
I don't want anyone else to die.

718
01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:32.679
Let me get on the ground.

719
01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:35.849
Just me. That's not against the rules.

720
01:10:36.274 --> 01:10:38.014
All right. I want you back real fast.

721
01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:40.767
Fine.

722
01:10:40.862 --> 01:10:44.525
Jack, nothing tricky now.
You know that I'm on top of you.

723
01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:47.653
Do not attempt to grow a brain.

724
01:10:57.003 --> 01:11:00.666
- So I guess there's a plan now?
- Could be.

725
01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:02.918
- Yeah?
- He's letting me off.

726
01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:06.251
- What?
- Just keep circling. You'll be fine.

727
01:11:08.014 --> 01:11:11.802
- Sit tight. I'm getting off for a minute.
- Do you think that's a good idea?

728
01:11:11.893 --> 01:11:14.600
- It'll be ok.
- Are you just gonna leave us here?

729
01:11:14.687 --> 01:11:17.975
- I would.
- Don't worry. I won't go far.

730
01:11:18.065 --> 01:11:21.603
Hey. Don't forget about us.

731
01:11:37.043 --> 01:11:39.500
The choppers are gone.
Let's dump the passengers.

732
01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:41.999
- He's ready for that.
- How is that possible?

733
01:11:42.089 --> 01:11:46.253
I don't know how. I just know he is.
He's been a step ahead every time.

734
01:11:46.385 --> 01:11:49.593
- If we unload, he'll take them out.
- So where does that put us?

735
01:11:49.722 --> 01:11:51.963
I have to try and dismantle that bomb.

736
01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:54.924
After an incredible ride on the 10 freeway,

737
01:11:55.061 --> 01:11:57.598
the streets of Los Angeles
and the 105 freeway,

738
01:11:57.730 --> 01:12:03.316
this bus has ended up here at Los Angeles
international airport, circling the runway.

739
01:12:15.122 --> 01:12:17.738
I'm telling you, he's
somewhere jerking off.

740
01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:21.622
He didn't have to get
on the bus in the first place, Ortiz.

741
01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:23.961
Get your ass behind the yellow line.

742
01:12:27.426 --> 01:12:28.916
What is that?

743
01:12:33.266 --> 01:12:35.302
I have no idea.

744
01:12:38.771 --> 01:12:41.137
We won't be able to hold
this steady for long.

745
01:12:41.274 --> 01:12:45.734
I just need a few minutes. If I can't
do it by then, I can't do it at all.

746
01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:49.187
- Harry, you with me?
- Yeah. You be careful, Jack.

747
01:12:53.786 --> 01:12:57.620
What's he doing? Oh, my god. He is insane.

748
01:13:03.671 --> 01:13:07.505
Ok, Jack, this is it. Don't get dead.

749
01:13:21.814 --> 01:13:24.476
- This is not a very good plan.
- Have faith, sister.

750
01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:25.567
Oh, Christ.

751
01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:38.194
Just keep it steady.

752
01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:40.822
Thank you for the tip, Ortiz.

753
01:13:52.345 --> 01:13:54.506
This guy is nuts!

754
01:13:55.765 --> 01:13:58.802
We'll try to bypass the remote current
with the battery.

755
01:13:58.893 --> 01:14:03.557
- Can you find the tripwire for the remote?
- I don't know. I got a few choices here.

756
01:14:03.689 --> 01:14:06.396
- Black and red?
- And green.

757
01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:10.852
Ok, I'm gonna guess he's not gonna go
with standard copper for the remote.

758
01:14:10.947 --> 01:14:13.359
That'd be too weak. I'd use a fibre alloy.

759
01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:16.566
Jack, I'm gonna need you
to look at the wire.

760
01:14:18.913 --> 01:14:20.153
Harry, it's covered.

761
01:14:20.247 --> 01:14:24.081
I know. You're gonna have to cut off
the sheath. But don't cut the wire.

762
01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:26.041
Right.

763
01:14:39.016 --> 01:14:41.098
Fuck me!

764
01:14:42.228 --> 01:14:43.228
Shit!

765
01:14:49.402 --> 01:14:50.687
- Bull's-eye!
- Great.

766
01:14:50.778 --> 01:14:54.362
Ok. I want you to clip on the battery
and then run it to the lead wire.

767
01:14:54.448 --> 01:14:55.448
Copy.

768
01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:14.711
I can't bypass. It'll fire.

769
01:15:14.802 --> 01:15:17.259
Oh, shit! It's a collapsible circuit.

770
01:15:18.597 --> 01:15:24.342
Howard Payne, Atlanta pd bomb squad.
Retired in sun valley in 1989

771
01:15:24.437 --> 01:15:27.804
when a small charge left him
with fingers numbering nine.

772
01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:31.307
That's our scumbag!
We got him. Jack, we found him.

773
01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:32.921
We can get to his place
inside of 15 minutes.

774
01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:35.186
Jack, get out of there.

775
01:15:35.281 --> 01:15:37.943
- We're going after the source.
- Watch your back.

776
01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:40.987
Wait for me!

777
01:15:41.662 --> 01:15:44.153
Mac, get me outta here.

778
01:15:56.510 --> 01:16:00.378
Somebody go to the back and check
and see if he came out the back. Go!

779
01:16:11.859 --> 01:16:14.271
- Can you see him?
- He's not behind us.

780
01:16:14.361 --> 01:16:16.477
- What?
- He's not back here.

781
01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:17.982
Oh, my god. Go look!

782
01:16:18.074 --> 01:16:22.488
Lay down and look under the bus
and see if you can see him down there.

783
01:16:23.662 --> 01:16:25.243
- Can you see him?
- No.

784
01:16:25.331 --> 01:16:28.289
You don't see him
back by the tyre or something?

785
01:16:28.375 --> 01:16:30.582
- I can't see him.
- Are you sure?

786
01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:32.079
I can't see him.

787
01:16:54.527 --> 01:16:58.236
Oh, my god! We hit him!
Oh, my god! Do you see him?

788
01:16:58.364 --> 01:17:01.231
- Did we hit him?
- Look out the sides.

789
01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:11.741
- My tools!
- Will somebody get him his tools?

790
01:17:23.722 --> 01:17:26.213
Please help him! Hurry!

791
01:17:26.934 --> 01:17:29.721
God, we're dragging him. Do you see him?

792
01:17:30.396 --> 01:17:32.637
Where is he? Is he there?

793
01:17:34.316 --> 01:17:38.150
- Do you see him?
- Jack! Jack!

794
01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:40.482
I see him! “What?

795
01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:42.905
I see him! You do? Is he ok?

796
01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:46.610
He's all right! He's all right!

797
01:17:46.745 --> 01:17:50.078
Hold my legs. Hold my legs.
Somebody hold my legs.

798
01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:52.248
Hold his legs.

799
01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:54.829
- Hold his legs!
- Come on!

800
01:17:56.755 --> 01:17:58.916
Come on! I got ya!

801
01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:07.964
- Is he hurt? Is he ok?
- Pull! Pull!

802
01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:10.136
Come on! Come on!

803
01:18:10.269 --> 01:18:12.601
We got him now. Come on, pull!

804
01:18:13.772 --> 01:18:15.683
Jesus. I can't believe it.

805
01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:20.936
You are a complete jerk. You know that?

806
01:18:22.781 --> 01:18:26.444
- Did you have any luck with the bomb?
- Yeah. It didn't go off.

807
01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:29.197
Ortiz, thanks.

808
01:18:29.288 --> 01:18:32.371
How many lives you got, man?

809
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.461
You're not too bright, man,
but you got some big, round, hairy cojones.

810
01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:43.624
That's... very gross, Ortiz.

811
01:18:45.012 --> 01:18:47.503
Can't even pay him a compliment.

812
01:18:48.641 --> 01:18:51.804
- How you doing?
- You scared the shit out of me, Jack!

813
01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:54.135
Other than that, I'm fine.

814
01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:57.814
- What is that smell?
- It's gas.

815
01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:00.391
- We're leaking gas?
- We are now.

816
01:19:04.823 --> 01:19:07.565
You felt you needed
another challenge or something?

817
01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:10.572
- Mac.
- Mac here. Go ahead.

818
01:19:10.663 --> 01:19:13.370
Can you get a fuel truck to pace us?
We're losing gas.

819
01:19:13.499 --> 01:19:18.994
- I'll see what I can find. How much time?
- 10 minutes? It doesn't look good.

820
01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:23.172
Gotcha. Norwood, get a fuel car
out here on the double.

821
01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:25.045
Is that gonna work?

822
01:19:26.095 --> 01:19:27.505
I don't know.

823
01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:33.177
Harry, save my life.

824
01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:09.187
Harry, tell me good news, man.

825
01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:12.027
Oh, I'm sorry, Jack. He didn't make it.

826
01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:16.151
You fuck!

827
01:21:17.956 --> 01:21:22.199
It was the watch that led him
to me, wasn't it? Huh?

828
01:21:22.294 --> 01:21:24.501
It seemed a little hammy to me to build

829
01:21:24.588 --> 01:21:26.829
the bomb out of
my precious retirement gift,

830
01:21:26.965 --> 01:21:32.631
but, you know, I figured a sign that said
"Howard Payne" would be pushing it.

831
01:21:34.848 --> 01:21:38.011
I'm gonna rip your fucking spine out,
I swear to god.

832
01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:41.060
You're gonna do exactly as you're told.

833
01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:45.185
Jack, we both know that he was the brains
of your particular operation.

834
01:21:45.317 --> 01:21:48.184
You can't beat me.
You're gonna pay me every dollar.

835
01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:52.984
Otherwise, you, the wildcat
and every innocent person on that bus

836
01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:55.987
are gonna end up just like your friend.

837
01:21:56.912 --> 01:22:00.871
Are you paying attention?
Jack, are you listening to me?

838
01:22:02.334 --> 01:22:05.292
Jack? Jack? Yeah.

839
01:22:05.379 --> 01:22:10.339
Good. You tell them that
the drop point is pershing square.

840
01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:14.797
There's a garbage can
on the northeast corner.

841
01:22:14.888 --> 01:22:17.425
You drop the bags and leave.

842
01:22:17.516 --> 01:22:20.428
I don't show until all
your people are gone.

843
01:22:21.353 --> 01:22:27.849
It's getting on to 11am, Jack, and I think
it's gonna be a very pretty day.

844
01:22:38.579 --> 01:22:40.240
Jack.

845
01:22:42.416 --> 01:22:46.955
Come on. Don't give up on me, Jack!
Jack, stop it! Jack, come on!

846
01:22:47.045 --> 01:22:50.287
Stop it, ok? Don't give up
on me right now, all right?

847
01:22:52.885 --> 01:22:58.255
We're really scared and we need you right
now. I can't do this by myself. Please?

848
01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:59.675
Jack, please.

849
01:23:04.771 --> 01:23:07.888
Ok? Please. All right?

850
01:23:13.906 --> 01:23:17.444
- We're gonna die.
- No, we're not. We got this far, ok?

851
01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:41.930
I'll be damned.

852
01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:49.145
Did you go to the university of Arizona?

853
01:23:49.274 --> 01:23:51.606
- Yeah? So?
- Good football team.

854
01:23:52.611 --> 01:23:55.353
Yeah, I guess so. I don't really know.

855
01:23:55.447 --> 01:23:57.278
Arizona wildcats.

856
01:23:59.451 --> 01:24:01.863
- Right.
- He can see you.

857
01:24:01.954 --> 01:24:04.912
- What?
- He can see you.

858
01:24:05.958 --> 01:24:07.914
Just keep looking straight ahead.

859
01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:28.473
He called you a wildcat before.
Bastard's got a camera right in your face.

860
01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:31.772
He can see the whole bus.
He's been playing me from minute one.

861
01:24:31.858 --> 01:24:36.227
- Well, he can see me, but can he hear me?
- Doesn't look like it. He's just watching.

862
01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:41.650
We are following the progress of what
is turning out to be a harrowing story,

863
01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:44.780
as a city bus,
rigged to explode if it slows down,

864
01:24:44.871 --> 01:24:48.113
races around literally in circles
at the Los Angeles airport.

865
01:24:48.208 --> 01:24:51.416
The dead are a female passenger
and a driver of another bus,

866
01:24:51.503 --> 01:24:53.084
both blown up by the bomber.

867
01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:56.129
Others in jeopardy are the passengers
of the bus,

868
01:24:56.216 --> 01:24:59.174
held hostage at the whim of a madman.

869
01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:03.253
"The whim of a madman.”

870
01:25:03.849 --> 01:25:05.339
I like that.

871
01:25:06.059 --> 01:25:09.347
There's a camera on the bus
just over my left shoulder.

872
01:25:09.438 --> 01:25:12.430
I want you to stare straight ahead.

873
01:25:12.524 --> 01:25:16.062
Don't make any big movements, ok?

874
01:25:17.613 --> 01:25:19.444
It's Jack.

875
01:25:19.531 --> 01:25:21.613
Yeah, I know about Harry.

876
01:25:24.202 --> 01:25:26.067
Is that news Van still around?

877
01:25:26.538 --> 01:25:29.405
- Get those cameras to stop taping.
- Right.

878
01:25:30.542 --> 01:25:33.784
LAPD. I need this unit.
You can broadcast uhf, right?

879
01:25:33.879 --> 01:25:36.666
There's a signal going to that bus.
I want you to find it.

880
01:25:37.424 --> 01:25:40.336
We're gonna have to take you off the air.

881
01:25:40.427 --> 01:25:42.668
Please, sir, stop taping.

882
01:25:42.763 --> 01:25:46.051
Come on, hurry up. Good! Tape off of that.

883
01:25:49.645 --> 01:25:53.183
Remember, no big movements.
Just look whipped.

884
01:25:53.273 --> 01:25:55.980
That ain't gonna be too hard.

885
01:26:07.412 --> 01:26:10.279
- Tape it. Good. Come on, tape it.
- It's taping!

886
01:26:20.592 --> 01:26:22.128
Jack. Yeah?

887
01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:24.296
Look.

888
01:26:27.808 --> 01:26:30.925
- Mac, fuel.
- Jack, five minutes.

889
01:26:31.269 --> 01:26:34.011
Not enough time. Run the tape.
We have to unload.

890
01:26:34.106 --> 01:26:36.768
- I only have a minute of tape.
- Do it now.

891
01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:40.692
I want you to make a tape and loop it
so that it runs over and over, ok?

892
01:26:43.532 --> 01:26:48.322
- All right, run it. Run it!
- All right. Tape's rolling.

893
01:26:48.453 --> 01:26:53.993
We still have no live picture, but reports
are that the bus continues to circle...

894
01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:58.827
Everyone is safe for the moment.

895
01:26:58.964 --> 01:27:02.673
Hard to imagine what's going
through their thoughts at this time.

896
01:27:02.801 --> 01:27:05.042
Certainly, a sense of community...

897
01:27:23.321 --> 01:27:26.529
Rig the steering wheel and the gas pedal.

898
01:27:28.994 --> 01:27:31.656
All right, let's get 'em off.

899
01:27:31.747 --> 01:27:33.829
Ok, you, you, and you.

900
01:27:35.041 --> 01:27:37.407
Police have just issued
a general statement,

901
01:27:37.502 --> 01:27:40.164
which doesn't tell us much more...

902
01:27:40.422 --> 01:27:43.664
Grab my wrist. That's it. Good.

903
01:27:43.759 --> 01:27:46.250
Come on. Look straight ahead.

904
01:28:05.238 --> 01:28:08.730
- That's good, that's good.
- Grab my wrist.

905
01:28:08.867 --> 01:28:11.074
Put your hand out. Take his hand.

906
01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:25.588
Come on, buddy. I got ya.

907
01:28:25.717 --> 01:28:28.550
Give me your hand. Your hand.

908
01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:33.138
Grab my hand. Don't look down.

909
01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:37.933
Shit!

910
01:28:38.271 --> 01:28:40.603
Jack!

911
01:28:42.484 --> 01:28:45.567
Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

912
01:28:53.453 --> 01:28:55.785
Jack! Jack, I can't hold this any more.

913
01:28:56.456 --> 01:28:58.196
Annie!

914
01:28:58.291 --> 01:28:59.622
You... hold on!

915
01:29:03.505 --> 01:29:05.587
No! No! No!

916
01:29:07.926 --> 01:29:09.006
Hold it.

917
01:29:16.101 --> 01:29:19.764
- Oh, god.
- Wedge down the gas pedal.

918
01:29:23.275 --> 01:29:25.357
Ok, I got it.

919
01:29:35.954 --> 01:29:38.616
- You got it?
- Yeah. I got it.

920
01:29:47.465 --> 01:29:50.457
- Ok, Annie, get on.
- Jack, I can't do this.

921
01:29:51.553 --> 01:29:54.966
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Shit. Shit.

922
01:29:56.975 --> 01:29:58.511
- Jack.
- Shit!

923
01:30:00.145 --> 01:30:01.681
Hold on.

924
01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:28.722
Shit!

925
01:31:35.991 --> 01:31:38.152
Are you all right?

926
01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:40.400
No.

927
01:31:41.663 --> 01:31:44.905
It's ok. It's ok. It's over.

928
01:31:45.625 --> 01:31:49.584
It's over. You did it. You did it.

929
01:31:54.592 --> 01:31:56.002
I hate the airport.

930
01:32:02.934 --> 01:32:05.095
You're not gonna get mushy on me,
are you?

931
01:32:06.354 --> 01:32:09.562
Maybe. I might.

932
01:32:12.110 --> 01:32:16.695
I hope not, cos relationships that start
under intense circumstances never last.

933
01:32:16.781 --> 01:32:19.443
- Oh, yeah?
- I've done extensive studying on this.

934
01:32:20.952 --> 01:32:22.988
Here comes the cavalry.

935
01:32:39.137 --> 01:32:41.628
How ya doing? “We're ok.

936
01:32:43.725 --> 01:32:47.263
I just might be a nice guy
and let you have the rest of the day off.

937
01:32:47.353 --> 01:32:48.433
Oh, boy.

938
01:32:49.481 --> 01:32:52.223
Mac, this is Annie.

939
01:32:52.317 --> 01:32:55.480
Annie, meet lieutenant McMahon.

940
01:32:55.570 --> 01:32:57.561
- How you doing?
- Ok.

941
01:33:01.618 --> 01:33:03.483
- Watch it.
- Sorry.

942
01:33:04.412 --> 01:33:07.825
- We're gonna have you guys checked out.
- Lieutenant!

943
01:33:09.417 --> 01:33:12.250
It's him. He wants to know
when he's gonna get his money.

944
01:33:12.337 --> 01:33:15.295
I'll tell him what to do
with his goddamn money.

945
01:33:15.381 --> 01:33:17.872
He doesn't know it blew up.

946
01:33:21.221 --> 01:33:22.586
30 minutes.

947
01:34:02.762 --> 01:34:04.878
I'll be right back.

948
01:34:07.767 --> 01:34:13.637
All right, here's our target. Fox, I want you
in 4-1, you in 1-2. You're in 3. Let's move it.

949
01:34:13.731 --> 01:34:17.064
- Is the paint bomb in with the money?
- It's done, sir.

950
01:35:17.295 --> 01:35:20.207
Too bad, Jack.
You could've made a good cop.

951
01:35:22.842 --> 01:35:24.252
Ok.

952
01:35:26.512 --> 01:35:33.133
We still have no live picture. Reports are
that the bus continues to circle inside lax

953
01:35:40.818 --> 01:35:43.150
No! No!

954
01:36:07.512 --> 01:36:10.549
Miss, you can't be this close.
You need to move back.

955
01:36:10.682 --> 01:36:12.138
No. Jack traven said...

956
01:36:12.225 --> 01:36:16.685
Jack traven asked that you be brought out
of harm's way. Just move right over here.

957
01:36:17.522 --> 01:36:20.685
- He's running a little late.
- He's not late.

958
01:36:22.193 --> 01:36:25.026
- What?
- He's never late.

959
01:36:25.113 --> 01:36:27.604
Well, that money hasn't moved.

960
01:36:27.699 --> 01:36:32.693
We got 200 eyes on that can, a bird dog
in the bag. I'd say he's covered.

961
01:36:37.250 --> 01:36:39.616
Turn it on.
What for? It hasn't moved.

962
01:36:39.711 --> 01:36:41.793
Just do it.

963
01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:52.132
Shit. It's moving. He's got the money.

964
01:36:52.223 --> 01:36:53.508
Jack!

965
01:37:03.318 --> 01:37:04.728
Shit!

966
01:37:22.628 --> 01:37:23.913
Freeze!

967
01:37:24.589 --> 01:37:28.173
Pop quiz, asshole.
You have a hair trigger aimed at your head.

968
01:37:28.259 --> 01:37:32.093
What do you do? What do you do?

969
01:37:33.431 --> 01:37:37.299
Turn around. Turn around!

970
01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:59.283
- Oh, no.
- I'm sorry.

971
01:38:01.501 --> 01:38:03.492
Be prepared.

972
01:38:03.628 --> 01:38:06.335
It's the boy scout marching song.

973
01:38:06.464 --> 01:38:10.798
What are you gonna do, Jack?
I don't think you can shoot her.

974
01:38:10.885 --> 01:38:12.125
Let her go.

975
01:38:13.638 --> 01:38:16.220
No, I don't think I'm gonna do that.

976
01:38:16.307 --> 01:38:18.969
Fill it. Now.

977
01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:25.437
I think Harry would be very disappointed,

978
01:38:25.525 --> 01:38:28.267
feeling that we're right back
where we started.

979
01:38:28.361 --> 01:38:32.070
Let her go. You don't need her.
You have the money. Take it and walk.

980
01:38:32.156 --> 01:38:35.648
Come on. Just take it and walk.
You don't need her.

981
01:38:35.743 --> 01:38:39.031
- Just take your goddamn money and walk!
- Stay right there.

982
01:38:39.163 --> 01:38:42.280
I'll do it. I'll let go. I'll let go.

983
01:38:42.375 --> 01:38:43.660
Oh, yeah.

984
01:38:44.502 --> 01:38:49.041
You still don't get it, do you, Jack? Huh?
The beauty of it.

985
01:38:50.007 --> 01:38:54.967
A bomb is made to explode.
That's its meaning, its purpose.

986
01:38:55.054 --> 01:39:00.765
Your life is empty because you spend it
trying to stop the bomb from becoming.

987
01:39:01.602 --> 01:39:03.684
And for who? For what?

988
01:39:05.064 --> 01:39:08.602
Do you know what a bomb is, Jack,
that doesn't explode?

989
01:39:08.693 --> 01:39:12.106
It is a cheap gold watch, buddy.

990
01:39:13.281 --> 01:39:17.615
You're crazy. You're fucking crazy.

991
01:39:17.702 --> 01:39:20.865
No. Poor people are crazy, Jack.

992
01:39:20.955 --> 01:39:23.662
I'm eccentric. Get the money. Let's go.

993
01:39:23.749 --> 01:39:26.365
Come on! Let's go! Move it! Move it!

994
01:39:26.461 --> 01:39:28.747
You stay! Move it! Move it!

995
01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:31.371
In the door. In that door! Now!

996
01:39:33.259 --> 01:39:36.217
Bye, Jack. Punk.

997
01:39:40.266 --> 01:39:41.551
All right!

998
01:39:43.311 --> 01:39:46.223
Get in there. Go on, get in.

999
01:39:46.939 --> 01:39:50.727
You get back in there!
You get this train moving! Go on!

1000
01:39:51.569 --> 01:39:54.276
Are these seats taken?

1001
01:39:54.405 --> 01:39:55.736
No. Go.

1002
01:39:58.826 --> 01:40:02.284
Come on. Back over here.
Hands around the pole.

1003
01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:24.306
Damn.

1004
01:40:43.955 --> 01:40:45.866
Come on, come on, come on!

1005
01:40:51.796 --> 01:40:55.004
Please report, westbound 501.
What is your position?

1006
01:40:59.887 --> 01:41:02.799
Westbound 501, please check in.

1007
01:41:02.890 --> 01:41:09.887
Westbound 501. We have police orders
to return to the station. Do you copy?

1008
01:41:10.314 --> 01:41:14.774
You have to hold this. It's like a grenade.
You have to help me now. Come on, hold it.

1009
01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:18.444
Don't let it go. Huh? I'm counting on you.

1010
01:41:18.531 --> 01:41:19.941
Do you copy?

1011
01:41:20.032 --> 01:41:22.489
Hey! I'll take it from here.

1012
01:41:34.505 --> 01:41:36.496
Maybe you'd better let me have this
after all.

1013
01:41:36.591 --> 01:41:38.877
I'm afraid you're a bit hysterical

1014
01:41:39.010 --> 01:41:41.501
and you might let this go a mite early.

1015
01:41:44.682 --> 01:41:47.674
Hey! Hey, buckaroo!

1016
01:41:47.768 --> 01:41:50.180
It's not cos you're a woman, all right?

1017
01:41:50.271 --> 01:41:54.605
Hey, it's all right. Looks
like we're all alone.

1018
01:41:54.692 --> 01:41:57.104
You won. You beat Jack.
You beat everybody.

1019
01:41:57.194 --> 01:41:59.856
Just throw me off the train. I don't care.

1020
01:42:00.364 --> 01:42:03.606
This stick works on a remote.

1021
01:42:03.701 --> 01:42:07.944
When you explode, that's where they'll
come, but it's not where I'll be.

1022
01:42:08.039 --> 01:42:13.204
I have a different plan. Mess like that,
they don't even count body parts.

1023
01:42:14.128 --> 01:42:16.084
Gives me more time.

1024
01:42:17.381 --> 01:42:19.872
It's not gonna hurt, Annie.

1025
01:42:32.772 --> 01:42:35.263
Hey, Jack, is that you?

1026
01:42:37.401 --> 01:42:40.859
He's so persistent. He always gets his man.

1027
01:42:40.946 --> 01:42:44.734
Wouldn't be able
to interest you in a bribe, would 1?

1028
01:42:44.825 --> 01:42:48.409
I've got plenty to go around.

1029
01:42:52.416 --> 01:42:54.247
My money!

1030
01:42:59.298 --> 01:43:02.916
You bastard! How does that feel?

1031
01:43:04.595 --> 01:43:08.338
You like that, huh? You
like it, you bastard?

1032
01:43:12.603 --> 01:43:14.514
My money!

1033
01:43:21.612 --> 01:43:22.943
Shit!

1034
01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:26.488
You! I'm coming for you, Jack!

1035
01:43:56.230 --> 01:43:59.347
Hey, I'll drop the stick, boy.
You want that?

1036
01:44:00.693 --> 01:44:03.355
I'm gonna get you.

1037
01:44:03.779 --> 01:44:05.019
Oh, yes!

1038
01:44:18.043 --> 01:44:22.286
What do you do, Jack? What do you do?
You're so smart, right, Jack?

1039
01:44:22.381 --> 01:44:27.671
You piece of shit! I'm the guy
with the plan cos I'm smarter than you.

1040
01:44:27.762 --> 01:44:29.844
I'm smarter than you.

1041
01:44:43.778 --> 01:44:45.234
Yeah.

1042
01:44:46.697 --> 01:44:48.437
But I'm taller.

1043
01:44:50.242 --> 01:44:51.448
Jack.

1044
01:44:52.369 --> 01:44:53.369
Jack!

1045
01:44:53.454 --> 01:44:56.196
Oh, god! I thought you were dead. Jack.

1046
01:44:58.793 --> 01:45:01.785
- Turn around.
- Where's Payne?

1047
01:45:01.879 --> 01:45:03.540
He lost his head.

1048
01:45:05.883 --> 01:45:08.249
Oh, god.

1049
01:45:08.385 --> 01:45:12.298
Let's take this off, shall we?
Yes. Let's take this off.

1050
01:45:15.142 --> 01:45:18.134
- Take it off.
- Hello? Hello?

1051
01:45:18.729 --> 01:45:23.063
Does anyone copy?
Jack, this is Mac. Can you hear me?

1052
01:45:24.610 --> 01:45:29.775
Jack, if you're there, you've got to stop
the train. The track isn't finished.

1053
01:45:29.907 --> 01:45:31.067
Mac, I copy.

1054
01:45:33.327 --> 01:45:35.693
- Mac.
- If someone can hear me...

1055
01:45:35.788 --> 01:45:41.078
- Mac, can you hear me?
- Try the emergency brake. Do you copy?

1056
01:45:43.295 --> 01:45:46.583
Nothing works!
Annie, you won't believe this.

1057
01:45:46.674 --> 01:45:48.084
What?

1058
01:45:48.926 --> 01:45:50.917
We have to jump.

1059
01:45:51.011 --> 01:45:53.093
You can't stop it?

1060
01:45:55.641 --> 01:45:59.805
Well, ok, undo me,
and I'd love to go with you. Come on.

1061
01:46:01.939 --> 01:46:04.055
I don't have a key. “What?

1062
01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:06.185
I don't have the key.

1063
01:46:27.047 --> 01:46:28.162
Shit.

1064
01:46:45.733 --> 01:46:48.566
You gotta get off...
You gotta get off the train.

1065
01:46:48.652 --> 01:46:53.021
Jack, please! This track dead-ends. You
gotta get off this train. This is crazy.

1066
01:46:53.157 --> 01:46:55.318
There's a curve ahead.

1067
01:46:55.409 --> 01:46:58.993
I'm gonna speed it up,
make it jump the track.

1068
01:46:59.079 --> 01:47:02.697
This is really stupid.
Jack, please. You can still jump.

1069
01:47:03.042 --> 01:47:06.159
Jack, please. Please, Jack?

1070
01:49:46.705 --> 01:49:51.290
I can't believe he hit my Van.
Come on. It's all right.

1071
01:49:51.376 --> 01:49:52.491
Unreal.

1072
01:49:55.089 --> 01:49:56.625
You didn't leave me.

1073
01:49:57.382 --> 01:49:58.838
I can't believe it.

1074
01:50:01.845 --> 01:50:03.335
You didn't leave me.

1075
01:50:04.431 --> 01:50:06.638
Didn't have anywhere to be just then.

1076
01:50:12.689 --> 01:50:14.145
Check it out.

1077
01:50:20.405 --> 01:50:21.986
I have to warn you.

1078
01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:27.284
I've heard relationships
based on intense experiences never work.

1079
01:50:27.371 --> 01:50:28.531
Ok.

1080
01:50:29.790 --> 01:50:32.202
We'll have to base it on sex, then.

1081
01:50:33.210 --> 01:50:35.371
Whatever you say, ma'am.

1082
01:55:52.362 --> 01:55:53.362
