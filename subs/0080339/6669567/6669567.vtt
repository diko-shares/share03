<i>There is no stopping in the red zone.</i>

13
00:02:04.968 --> 00:02:06.720
Hello. We'd like you to have this flower

14
00:02:06.803 --> 00:02:08.430
from the Religious
Consciousness Church.

15
00:02:08.513 --> 00:02:11.858
- Would you care to make a donation?
- No, but thank you, anyway.

16
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.108
<i>The red zone is

<i>There is no stopping in the white zone.</i>

00:02:21.943 --> 00:02:25.288
<i>No, the white
zone is for loading and unloading,</i>

20
00:02:25.363 --> 00:02:28.207
<i>and there is no stopping in the red zone.</i>

21
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.374
<i>The red zone has
always been for loading and unloading.</i>

22
00:02:32.537 --> 00:02:34.960
<i>There is never stopping in a white zone.</i>

23
00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:37.542
<i>Don't tell me
which zone is for stopping</i>

24
00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:39.252
<i>and which zone is for loading.</i>

25
00:02:39.335 --> 00:02:43.135
<i>Listen, Betty, don't
start up with your white zone shit again.</i>

26
00:02:45.967 --> 00:02:47.685
Hello. We'd like you to have this flower

27
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.979
from the Church
of Religious Consciousness.

28
00:02:50.054 --> 00:02:51.601
Would you like to make a donation?

29
00:02:51.764 --> 00:02:54.233
No, thanks. We gave at the office.

30
00:02:54.767 --> 00:02:56.440
<i>Flight 988 to Milwaukee</i>

31
00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.614
<i>is now in the final boarding process
at Gate 34.</i>

32
00:03:03.067 --> 00:03:06.822
Would you put all your metal objects
into this dish, please?

33
00:03:14.871 --> 00:03:17.340
<i>There's just no
stopping in a white zone.</i>

34
00:03:17.415 --> 00:03:19.713
<i>Oh, really,
Vernon? Why pretend?</i>

35
00:03:19.792 --> 00:03:22.671
<i>We both know perfectly well
what it is you're talking about.</i>

36
00:03:22.754 --> 00:03:24.631
<i>You want me to have an abortion.</i>

37
00:03:24.714 --> 00:03:28.059
<i>It's really the only
sensible thing to do, if it's done properly</i>

38
00:03:28.134 --> 00:03:31.354
<i>Therapeutically,
there's no danger involved.</i>

39
00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:32.521
Taxi!

40
00:03:40.897 --> 00:03:42.399
I'll be back in a minute.

41
00:03:49.364 --> 00:03:51.366
Hello, sir.
We'd like you to have this flower

42
00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:53.702
on behalf of the Church
of Religious Consciousness.

43
00:03:53.785 --> 00:03:55.412
Would you care...

44
00:04:11.135 --> 00:04:12.432
Hey, Larry, where's the forklift?

45
00:04:12.804 --> 00:04:13.896
Forklift?

46
00:04:13.972 --> 00:04:16.816
It's over there by the baggage loader.

47
00:04:20.478 --> 00:04:21.730
Look out!

48
00:04:33.825 --> 00:04:35.668
- Elaine!
- Ted!

49
00:04:36.995 --> 00:04:38.997
I came home early and found your note.

50
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.253
I guess you meant for me to read it later.

51
00:04:41.332 --> 00:04:43.209
Elaine, I've gotta talk to you.

52
00:04:43.293 --> 00:04:45.671
I just don't wanna go over it anymore.

53
00:04:46.504 --> 00:04:48.381
I know things haven't been right
for a long time,

54
00:04:48.464 --> 00:04:49.932
but it'll be different.

55
00:04:50.008 --> 00:04:51.760
Like it was in the beginning.

56
00:04:51.843 --> 00:04:53.937
If you'll just be patient,
I can work things out.

57
00:04:54.554 --> 00:04:57.228
I have been patient,
and I've tried to help,

58
00:04:57.307 --> 00:04:59.230
but you wouldn't even let me do that.

59
00:05:01.644 --> 00:05:04.443
Don't you feel anything
for me at all anymore?

60
00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:08.819
It takes so many things
to make love last.

61
00:05:08.901 --> 00:05:11.279
Most of all, it takes respect.

62
00:05:11.362 --> 00:05:14.286
And I can't live with a man
I don't respect.

63
00:05:21.164 --> 00:05:22.666
What a pisser.

64
00:05:32.091 --> 00:05:34.560
<i>Captain Oveur,
white courtesy phone.</i>

65
00:05:34.636 --> 00:05:37.731
<i>Captain Clarence Oveur,
white courtesy phone.</i>

66
00:05:43.186 --> 00:05:45.029
<i>- No, the white phone.
- Oh.</i>

67
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.026
This is Captain Oveur.

68
00:05:50.109 --> 00:05:52.703
<i>One moment for your call
from the Mayo Clinic.</i>

69
00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:54.998
<i>Captain Oveur, white
courtesy phone.</i>

70
00:05:55.073 --> 00:05:56.416
<i>Captain Clarence Oveur.</i>

71
00:05:56.491 --> 00:05:59.085
<i>- I've got it!
- Thank you.</i>

72
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.833
<i>Go ahead with your call.</i>

73
00:06:00.912 --> 00:06:03.040
<i>This is Dr. Brody at
the Mayo Clinic.</i>

74
00:06:03.122 --> 00:06:05.671
There's a passenger
on your Chicago flight, 209'er.

75
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.095
A little girl named Lisa Davis,
en route to Minneapolis.

76
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.843
She's scheduled for a heart transplant,

77
00:06:10.922 --> 00:06:13.801
and we'd like you to tell her mother
that we found a donor an hour ago.

78
00:06:14.175 --> 00:06:15.768
<i>We have the heart here
ready for surgery</i>

79
00:06:15.843 --> 00:06:19.347
<i>We must have the recipient
on the operating table within six hours.</i>

80
00:06:19.597 --> 00:06:22.646
I want you to make sure
that she's kept in a reclined position,

81
00:06:22.725 --> 00:06:25.524
and that a continuous watch
is kept on her IV.

82
00:06:26.187 --> 00:06:28.360
<i>Also, it's very important
that she remain calm.</i>

83
00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:30.692
<i>Excuse me,
this is the operator, Captain Oveur.</i>

84
00:06:30.775 --> 00:06:34.700
<i>I have an emergency call
for you on line 5 from a Mr. Hamm.</i>

85
00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:36.998
All right, give me Hamm on 5,
hold the Mayo.

86
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:05.768
Look. You'll be back
in town tomorrow night.

87
00:07:05.852 --> 00:07:07.854
We'll have dinner. We'll talk things over.

88
00:07:07.937 --> 00:07:10.736
I won't be back.
I've requested the Atlanta run.

89
00:07:10.815 --> 00:07:12.032
Elaine,

90
00:07:12.817 --> 00:07:14.535
I promise I can change.

91
00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.990
Then why didn't you take the job
that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?

92
00:07:19.115 --> 00:07:22.790
You know I haven't been able
to get near a plane since the war.

93
00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:24.086
Even if I could,

94
00:07:24.162 --> 00:07:26.256
they wouldn't hire me
because of my war record.

95
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.502
Your war record?

96
00:07:28.082 --> 00:07:29.925
You're the only one keeping that alive.

97
00:07:30.001 --> 00:07:32.379
For everyone else, it's ancient history.

98
00:07:32.754 --> 00:07:34.347
You expect me to believe that?

99
00:07:34.797 --> 00:07:35.889
It's the truth.

100
00:07:35.965 --> 00:07:38.764
What's hurt you the most
is your record since the war.

101
00:07:38.843 --> 00:07:40.595
Different cities, different jobs.

102
00:07:40.678 --> 00:07:44.273
And not one of them shows
you can accept any real responsibility.

103
00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:47.352
- Elaine, if you just give me one more...
- It's too late, Ted.

104
00:07:47.852 --> 00:07:52.232
When I get back to Chicago,
I'm going to start my life all over again.

105
00:07:52.315 --> 00:07:53.658
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:56.861 --> 00:07:58.659
Excuse me,
we'd like you to have this flower

107
00:07:58.738 --> 00:08:01.491
from the Church
of Religious Conscious...

108
00:08:09.957 --> 00:08:10.958
- Good evening.
- Hi.

109
00:08:11.042 --> 00:08:13.136
Well, good evening. There you go.

110
00:08:13.211 --> 00:08:14.212
You can just follow all the way back.

111
00:08:14.295 --> 00:08:15.296
- Thank you.
- Hi, how are you tonight?

112
00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:16.426
Hello.

113
00:08:19.967 --> 00:08:23.016
Any word on that storm
lifting over Salt Lake, Clarence?

114
00:08:23.095 --> 00:08:25.223
No, not likely, Victor.

115
00:08:25.306 --> 00:08:27.400
I just reviewed the area report

116
00:08:27.475 --> 00:08:30.024
- for 1600 hours through 2400.
- Uh-huh.

117
00:08:30.102 --> 00:08:32.104
There's an occluded front
stalled over the Dakotas,

118
00:08:32.188 --> 00:08:34.611
backed up all the way to Utah.

119
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:36.738
Yeah, well, if she decides to push over
to the Great Lakes,

120
00:08:36.818 --> 00:08:38.820
- it could get plenty soupy.
- Mmm-hmm.

121
00:08:38.903 --> 00:08:40.701
Hey, what about that southern route
around Tulsa?

122
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.203
Well, I double-checked
the terminal forecast,

123
00:08:43.282 --> 00:08:46.536
and the wind's aloft,
and IFR ceilings all the way.

124
00:08:46.619 --> 00:08:48.212
Where do they top out?

125
00:08:48.287 --> 00:08:52.383
Well, there's some light scattered cover
at 20,000, icing around 18.

126
00:08:53.626 --> 00:08:56.550
It looks like the original flight plan
over Denver is the best bet.

127
00:08:57.129 --> 00:08:58.176
Denver it is.

128
00:08:58.256 --> 00:08:59.303
Sorry, Clarence.

129
00:08:59.382 --> 00:09:01.430
Latest weather report
shows everything socked in

130
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:02.977
from Salt Lake to Lincoln.

131
00:09:03.052 --> 00:09:04.850
Oh, hi, Roger. Glad to have you aboard.

132
00:09:04.929 --> 00:09:06.897
Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Victor Basta.

133
00:09:06.973 --> 00:09:09.067
- How do you do, Roger?
- Nice to meet you.

134
00:09:09.141 --> 00:09:10.518
Roger, I was telling Victor,

135
00:09:10.601 --> 00:09:14.322
I reviewed the area report
for 1600 hours through 2400.

136
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:19.285
There's an occluded front
stalled over the Dakotas.

137
00:09:28.786 --> 00:09:30.538
There you go. Thank you.

138
00:09:31.664 --> 00:09:34.292
Can you tell me
if Elaine Dickinson is on this flight?

139
00:09:34.375 --> 00:09:36.878
Well, the whole flight crew has boarded.

140
00:09:36.961 --> 00:09:38.304
Let me see.

141
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.257
Oh, yes. She is on board.

142
00:09:44.218 --> 00:09:46.721
I'd like one ticket to Chicago.

143
00:09:46.804 --> 00:09:48.056
No baggage.

144
00:09:53.769 --> 00:09:56.648
- Smoking or nonsmoking?
- Smoking, please.

145
00:09:59.275 --> 00:10:01.243
There. Have a nice trip.

146
00:10:18.002 --> 00:10:20.346
<i>Striker,
this is Red Leader 4.</i>

147
00:10:20.421 --> 00:10:23.015
<i>Primary target covered by fog.</i>

148
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.263
<i>The decision to proceed is yours.</i>

149
00:10:25.343 --> 00:10:28.096
<i>The decision is yours.</i>

150
00:10:28.179 --> 00:10:31.774
<i>Is yours.</i>

151
00:10:40.566 --> 00:10:41.692
Shit, man.

152
00:11:48.426 --> 00:11:49.678
Nervous?

153
00:11:50.594 --> 00:11:51.641
Yes.

154
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:53.773
First time?

155
00:11:55.057 --> 00:11:57.606
No, I've been nervous lots of times.

156
00:12:04.275 --> 00:12:08.121
Hi, we'll be taking off real soon,
so I better fasten you in tight.

157
00:12:08.195 --> 00:12:09.196
Thank you.

158
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.203
Oh, Mother, this is so exciting.

159
00:12:11.282 --> 00:12:14.252
I know, but remember,
you must get some rest.

160
00:12:14.326 --> 00:12:15.452
That's good advice.

161
00:12:15.536 --> 00:12:18.210
You relax,
and I'll be back right after we take off.

162
00:12:18.289 --> 00:12:19.666
Thank you.

163
00:12:22.126 --> 00:12:26.097
- God, Bill, I'm gonna miss you so much.
- I'm gonna miss you too.

164
00:12:26.172 --> 00:12:27.799
Promise you'll write?

165
00:12:28.632 --> 00:12:29.975
Every day.

166
00:12:31.969 --> 00:12:33.061
Bill!

167
00:12:33.596 --> 00:12:35.564
Better get on board, son.

168
00:12:37.641 --> 00:12:38.984
All aboard!

169
00:12:39.935 --> 00:12:43.064
209'er to ground control.
We're loaded and ready to taxi.

170
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.903
Goodbye, Bill!

171
00:12:44.982 --> 00:12:46.074
Goodbye, darling!

172
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.868
I love you, darling!

173
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:50.538
<i>209'er,
taxi to runway 19'er.</i>

174
00:12:53.157 --> 00:12:55.000
Goodbye, darling!

175
00:12:55.076 --> 00:12:57.454
Have your picture taken
the minute you get there

176
00:12:57.536 --> 00:12:58.753
and send me one, all right?

177
00:12:58.829 --> 00:13:00.456
Okay. Here, hurry.

178
00:13:01.957 --> 00:13:02.924
Oh!

179
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.174
But your watch. You shouldn't.
You're gonna need this.

180
00:13:06.337 --> 00:13:09.341
- It's all right. It doesn't work.
- Bill!

181
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:10.762
Goodbye, darling!

182
00:13:11.008 --> 00:13:12.180
Bill...

183
00:13:13.677 --> 00:13:16.977
Bill! Bill... With me all the time.

184
00:13:17.056 --> 00:13:18.182
- I swear to you!
- So long, darling.

185
00:13:18.265 --> 00:13:19.767
Take care of yourself. Goodbye!

186
00:13:20.101 --> 00:13:22.229
<i>Flight
209'er, you're cleared for takeoff.</i>

187
00:13:22.311 --> 00:13:23.563
- Roger.
- Huh?

188
00:13:23.729 --> 00:13:26.608
<i>L.A. departure
frequency 123.9'er.</i>

189
00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.067
- Roger.
- Huh?

190
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.619
- Request vector. Over.
- What?

191
00:13:30.694 --> 00:13:33.493
<i>Flight 209'er,
clear for vector 324.</i>

192
00:13:33.572 --> 00:13:34.949
We have clearance, Clarence.

193
00:13:35.032 --> 00:13:37.706
Roger, Roger.
What's our vector, Victor?

194
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.128
Tower radioed clearance, over.

195
00:13:40.204 --> 00:13:42.298
That's
Clarence Oveur, over.

196
00:13:42.373 --> 00:13:43.750
- Roger.
- Huh?

197
00:13:43.833 --> 00:13:45.176
<i>- Roger. Over.
- What?</i>

198
00:13:45.251 --> 00:13:46.753
- Huh?
- Who?

199
00:14:12.444 --> 00:14:14.572
Do you feel all right, sir?

200
00:14:14.905 --> 00:14:15.906
Oh...

201
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.334
I haven't flown for a long time.

202
00:14:27.084 --> 00:14:29.382
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
this is Captain Oveur speaking.

203
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.967
<i>- Here you go.
- We'll be cruising</i>

204
00:14:31.046 --> 00:14:33.344
<i>- at 36,000 feet this evening.
- Stewardess?</i>

205
00:14:33.424 --> 00:14:37.930
<i>Our arrival time in Chicago
will be 10:45 p.m. Central time.</i>

206
00:14:38.762 --> 00:14:41.015
<i>The temperature there
is currently 62 degrees,</i>

207
00:14:41.098 --> 00:14:43.521
<i>with a 20 % chance of precipitation.</i>

208
00:14:43.601 --> 00:14:45.945
<i>Meanwhile, relax and enjoy your flight.</i>

209
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:49.820
- Would you like something to read?
- Do you have anything light?

210
00:14:51.859 --> 00:14:55.989
<i>How about this leaflet,
"Famous Jewish Sports Legends"?</i>

211
00:14:56.071 --> 00:14:57.698
Yes. Thank you.

212
00:14:59.533 --> 00:15:02.707
- Ted! What are you doing here?
- Elaine, I've got to talk to you.

213
00:15:02.786 --> 00:15:05.335
You shouldn't have come.
I don't have time now.

214
00:15:05.414 --> 00:15:07.542
- Oh, stewardess?
- Excuse me.

215
00:15:07.708 --> 00:15:08.834
But...

216
00:15:21.305 --> 00:15:23.774
No wonder you're upset.

217
00:15:23.849 --> 00:15:25.476
She's lovely.

218
00:15:27.478 --> 00:15:29.276
And a darling figure.

219
00:15:30.439 --> 00:15:32.487
Supple, pouting breasts.

220
00:15:33.359 --> 00:15:34.861
Firm thighs.

221
00:15:36.403 --> 00:15:38.997
It's a shame you two don't get along.

222
00:15:39.615 --> 00:15:40.992
Yes, I know.

223
00:15:41.909 --> 00:15:44.037
Things used to be different.

224
00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:48.423
I remember when we first met.

225
00:15:49.917 --> 00:15:51.794
It was during the war.

226
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.547
I was in the Air Force,

227
00:15:54.672 --> 00:15:57.721
stationed in Drambuie
off the Barbary Coast.

228
00:15:58.842 --> 00:16:01.311
<i>I used to hang out at the Magumba Bar.</i>

229
00:16:01.387 --> 00:16:04.766
<i>It was a rough place,
the seediest dive on the wharf,</i>

230
00:16:04.848 --> 00:16:07.192
<i>populated with every reject and cutthroat</i>

231
00:16:07.268 --> 00:16:09.521
<i>from Bombay to Calcutta.</i>

232
00:16:09.603 --> 00:16:11.651
<i>It was worse than Detroit.</i>

233
00:16:22.866 --> 00:16:25.164
<i>The mood in the place
was downright ugly.</i>

234
00:16:25.244 --> 00:16:28.293
<i>You wouldn't walk in there
unless you knew how to use your fists.</i>

235
00:16:28.372 --> 00:16:32.093
<i>You could count on a fight
breaking out almost every night.</i>

236
00:17:41.862 --> 00:17:46.038
<i>I didn't go there that night to fall in love.
I just dropped in for a couple of drinks.</i>

237
00:17:46.116 --> 00:17:48.164
<i>But suddenly, there she was.</i>

238
00:17:57.836 --> 00:18:01.761
<i>I was captivated, entranced.
It hit me like a thunderbolt.</i>

239
00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.717
<i>I had to ask the guy next to me
to pinch me</i>

240
00:18:03.801 --> 00:18:06.099
<i>to make sure I wasn't dreaming.</i>

241
00:18:11.308 --> 00:18:15.154
<i>I was afraid to approach her.
But that night, fate was on my side.</i>

242
00:21:22.874 --> 00:21:24.547
<i>We laughed. We talked.</i>

243
00:21:25.294 --> 00:21:26.546
We danced.

244
00:21:26.628 --> 00:21:30.258
I never wanted it to end.
Hell, I guess I still don't.

245
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:34.345
But enough about me.
I hope this hasn't been boring for you.

246
00:21:34.511 --> 00:21:36.309
It's just that whenever
I start to talk about Elaine,

247
00:21:36.388 --> 00:21:38.607
I always get so carried away.

248
00:21:38.682 --> 00:21:40.559
I lose all track of time.

249
00:21:41.852 --> 00:21:43.274
Would you like to order dinner now?

250
00:21:43.353 --> 00:21:46.527
Yes. Joey will have the steak,
and my wife and I will have the fish.

251
00:21:46.607 --> 00:21:48.450
When can I see the cockpit, Dad?

252
00:21:48.525 --> 00:21:49.572
Joey, I think the pilots

253
00:21:49.651 --> 00:21:52.370
are probably too busy
flying the plane for that.

254
00:21:52.446 --> 00:21:53.993
Oh, gee whiz.

255
00:21:54.072 --> 00:21:55.289
I'll tell you what, Joey.

256
00:21:55.365 --> 00:21:57.959
I'll talk to the captain
and see what I can arrange.

257
00:21:58.035 --> 00:21:59.912
Gee, that'd be swell!

258
00:22:02.914 --> 00:22:05.542
Would you gentlemen
care to order your dinners?

259
00:22:10.881 --> 00:22:11.928
Lookie here.

260
00:22:22.476 --> 00:22:23.648
Excuse me.

261
00:22:23.727 --> 00:22:25.274
I happened to be passing,

262
00:22:25.354 --> 00:22:27.777
and I thought
you'd might like some coffee.

263
00:22:27.856 --> 00:22:30.484
Oh, that's very nice of you. Thank you.

264
00:22:33.028 --> 00:22:34.951
Won't you sit down?

265
00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:36.373
Thank you.

266
00:22:38.659 --> 00:22:39.706
Cream?

267
00:22:39.785 --> 00:22:41.958
No, thank you. I take it black.

268
00:22:42.037 --> 00:22:43.414
Like my men.

269
00:22:51.296 --> 00:22:53.264
Well, you see...

270
00:23:53.567 --> 00:23:56.662
Oh, Ted, I never knew
I could be so happy.

271
00:23:56.737 --> 00:24:00.287
These past few months
have been just wonderful.

272
00:24:00.365 --> 00:24:02.367
Tomorrow, why don't we drive
up the coast

273
00:24:02.451 --> 00:24:04.374
to that little seafood place, and...

274
00:24:05.495 --> 00:24:06.963
What's the matter?

275
00:24:07.622 --> 00:24:09.590
My orders came through.

276
00:24:09.666 --> 00:24:11.509
My squadron ships out tomorrow.

277
00:24:11.585 --> 00:24:15.180
We're bombing the storage depots
at Daiquiri at 1800 hours.

278
00:24:15.255 --> 00:24:17.849
We're coming in from the north,
below their radar.

279
00:24:18.258 --> 00:24:19.635
When will you be back?

280
00:24:20.177 --> 00:24:21.679
I can't tell you that.

281
00:24:21.762 --> 00:24:22.979
It's classified.

282
00:24:23.638 --> 00:24:27.268
Oh, Ted, please be careful.
I worry about you so much.

283
00:24:28.977 --> 00:24:30.354
I love you, Elaine.

284
00:24:30.937 --> 00:24:32.314
I love you.

285
00:24:54.419 --> 00:24:58.049
<i>Flight 209'er,
this is Denver flight control.</i>

286
00:24:58.131 --> 00:25:00.008
<i>You're approaching
some rough weather.</i>

287
00:25:00.091 --> 00:25:02.219
<i>Please climb to 42,000 feet.</i>

288
00:25:03.762 --> 00:25:04.979
Roger, Denver.

289
00:25:05.055 --> 00:25:06.898
We have a visitor.

290
00:25:06.973 --> 00:25:08.225
- Hello.
- Hi.

291
00:25:08.308 --> 00:25:11.357
This is Captain Oveur,
Mr. Murdock and Mr. Basta.

292
00:25:11.436 --> 00:25:12.608
This is Joey Hammen.

293
00:25:12.687 --> 00:25:15.110
- Well, hi, Joey.
- Come on up here. You can see better.

294
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:17.613
Joey, we have something here
for our special visitors.

295
00:25:17.692 --> 00:25:20.992
- Would you like to have it?
- Thank you. Thanks a lot!

296
00:25:21.071 --> 00:25:23.415
Sure. You ever been in a cockpit before?

297
00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:26.744
No, sir,
I've never been up in a plane before.

298
00:25:26.827 --> 00:25:29.250
Have you ever seen
a grown man naked?

299
00:25:29.329 --> 00:25:31.172
Do you want me to check
the weather, Clarence?

300
00:25:31.248 --> 00:25:33.342
No, why don't you take care of it?

301
00:25:33.416 --> 00:25:37.091
Joey, do you ever
hang around a gymnasium?

302
00:25:37.587 --> 00:25:39.134
We'd better get back now, Joey.

303
00:25:39.214 --> 00:25:41.433
No, Joey can stay here
for a while if he'd like.

304
00:25:41.508 --> 00:25:43.761
- Could I?
- Okay. If you don't get in the way.

305
00:25:43.844 --> 00:25:45.846
Flight 209'er to Denver radio.

306
00:25:46.096 --> 00:25:48.144
Climbing to cruise at 42,000.

307
00:25:48.265 --> 00:25:51.485
Will report again over Lincoln.
Over and out.

308
00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.688
Wait a minute. I know you.

309
00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:55.647
You're Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

310
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:58.779
You play basketball
for the Los Angeles Lakers.

311
00:25:59.484 --> 00:26:02.203
I'm sorry, son, but you must
have me confused with someone else.

312
00:26:02.279 --> 00:26:05.203
My name is Roger Murdock.
I'm the co-pilot.

313
00:26:05.282 --> 00:26:09.412
You are Kareem. I've seen you play.
My dad's got season tickets.

314
00:26:10.036 --> 00:26:13.290
I think you should go back
to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?

315
00:26:14.165 --> 00:26:17.214
No, he's not bothering anyone.
Let him stay here.

316
00:26:18.587 --> 00:26:19.759
All right, but just remember,

317
00:26:19.838 --> 00:26:22.387
my name is Roger Murdock.

318
00:26:22.465 --> 00:26:24.058
I'm an airline pilot.

319
00:26:24.593 --> 00:26:25.936
I think you're the greatest,

320
00:26:26.011 --> 00:26:29.481
but my dad says
you don't work hard enough on defense.

321
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.565
And he says that lots of times,
you don't even run down court.

322
00:26:34.978 --> 00:26:38.107
And that you don't really try
except during the playoffs.

323
00:26:38.273 --> 00:26:39.900
The hell I don't!

324
00:26:41.776 --> 00:26:43.244
Listen, kid.

325
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.914
I've been hearing that crap
ever since I was at UCLA.

326
00:26:46.114 --> 00:26:49.288
I'm out there
busting my buns every night.

327
00:26:49.367 --> 00:26:51.415
Tell your old man
to drag Walton and Lanier

328
00:26:51.494 --> 00:26:54.088
up and down the court for 48 minutes.

329
00:27:00.754 --> 00:27:01.846
Joey?

330
00:27:02.714 --> 00:27:05.137
You like movies about gladiators?

331
00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.023
Elaine, just hear me out.

332
00:27:13.016 --> 00:27:16.816
I know things haven't been right
for a long time, but it'll be different.

333
00:27:16.895 --> 00:27:19.523
Like it was in the beginning, remember?

334
00:27:20.023 --> 00:27:21.525
I remember everything.

335
00:27:23.193 --> 00:27:25.787
All I have are memories.

336
00:27:25.862 --> 00:27:29.207
Mostly, I remember the nights
when we were together.

337
00:27:29.282 --> 00:27:31.876
I remember how you used to hold me.

338
00:27:32.869 --> 00:27:36.089
How I used to sit on your face
and wriggle,

339
00:27:36.164 --> 00:27:39.919
and afterwards how we'd watch
till the sun came up.

340
00:27:40.001 --> 00:27:42.675
When it did, it was almost like...

341
00:27:43.505 --> 00:27:47.885
Like each new day
was created only for us.

342
00:27:48.301 --> 00:27:50.895
That's the way
I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.

343
00:27:50.971 --> 00:27:52.598
But it won't be.

344
00:27:52.681 --> 00:27:55.901
Not as long as you insist
on living in the past.

345
00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.869
<i>You're too low, Ted.
You're too low.</i>

346
00:28:16.204 --> 00:28:18.832
You mustn't believe everything
that you see.

347
00:28:18.915 --> 00:28:21.668
The mind can play tricks on people.

348
00:28:21.751 --> 00:28:23.594
Pain. Pain.

349
00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:26.219
- He looks so happy today, doesn't he?
- Okay, I'll be back.

350
00:28:26.297 --> 00:28:28.595
Thank you, thank you.
You look so happy today.

351
00:28:30.218 --> 00:28:33.347
Okay, Robert, slip them down.
This won't hurt much.

352
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:34.773
Give me a big smile.

353
00:28:34.848 --> 00:28:37.522
You got a telegram
from headquarters today.

354
00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.193
Headquarters! What is it?

355
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:41.442
Well, it's a big building
where generals meet,

356
00:28:41.521 --> 00:28:43.364
but that's not important right now.

357
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.692
They've cleared you of any blame

358
00:28:44.774 --> 00:28:46.196
for what happened on that raid.

359
00:28:46.276 --> 00:28:47.528
Isn't that good news?

360
00:28:48.445 --> 00:28:49.617
Is it?

361
00:28:50.405 --> 00:28:54.251
Because of my mistake,
six men didn't return from that raid.

362
00:28:54.951 --> 00:28:58.501
Seven, Lieutenant Zipp
died this morning.

363
00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.753
But Dr. Sandler says
you'll be out in a week.

364
00:29:00.832 --> 00:29:02.584
Isn't that wonderful?

365
00:29:04.085 --> 00:29:06.713
I wish I could say the same
for George Zipp.

366
00:29:07.297 --> 00:29:08.389
Be patient, Ted.

367
00:29:08.465 --> 00:29:11.719
Nobody expects you
to get over this immediately.

368
00:29:11.801 --> 00:29:15.055
Hey, Striker. How about a break?
I'm getting tired.

369
00:29:16.014 --> 00:29:17.891
Yeah, all right. Take five.

370
00:29:19.726 --> 00:29:20.943
Thanks.

371
00:29:21.603 --> 00:29:24.823
I've found a wonderful apartment for us.

372
00:29:24.898 --> 00:29:28.118
It has a brick fireplace
and a cute little bedroom

373
00:29:28.193 --> 00:29:30.537
with mirrors on the ceiling, and...

374
00:29:30.612 --> 00:29:33.206
Red Leader! Red Leader!
I'm going down.

375
00:29:33.281 --> 00:29:34.954
Captain Geline.

376
00:29:35.033 --> 00:29:37.081
He thinks he's a pilot,
still fighting the war.

377
00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.958
...around here somewhere.

378
00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:42.294
I've found the tunnel, Johnson!
It's this way!

379
00:29:42.373 --> 00:29:45.502
$25 for a cigarette is too much!

380
00:29:48.797 --> 00:29:50.390
What's his problem?

381
00:29:50.465 --> 00:29:52.183
That's Lieutenant Hurwitz.

382
00:29:52.258 --> 00:29:54.352
Severe shell shock.

383
00:29:54.427 --> 00:29:56.555
He thinks he's Ethel Merman.

384
00:29:56.638 --> 00:29:59.016
<i>You'll be swell</i>

385
00:29:59.099 --> 00:30:00.567
<i>You'll be great</i>

386
00:30:00.642 --> 00:30:03.646
<i>Gonna have the whole world on a plate</i>

387
00:30:03.728 --> 00:30:06.732
<i>Startin' here, startin' now</i>

388
00:30:06.815 --> 00:30:10.991
<i>Honey, everything's coming up</i>

389
00:30:11.069 --> 00:30:14.198
<i>roses</i>

390
00:30:15.156 --> 00:30:16.533
War is hell.

391
00:30:21.871 --> 00:30:23.623
Excuse me, sir.

392
00:30:23.706 --> 00:30:26.334
Would you like some coffee
before we serve dinner?

393
00:30:26.417 --> 00:30:28.215
No. No, thank you.

394
00:30:30.171 --> 00:30:32.390
Would either of you like
another cup of coffee?

395
00:30:32.465 --> 00:30:34.138
I will, but Jim won't.

396
00:30:34.217 --> 00:30:37.096
I think I will have another cup of coffee.

397
00:30:38.763 --> 00:30:41.733
<i>Jim never has
a second cup of coffee at home.</i>

398
00:30:47.897 --> 00:30:50.571
- Excuse me, Sister.
- Yes?

399
00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:52.323
There's a little girl on board, up front,

400
00:30:52.402 --> 00:30:55.497
- who's ill and, well...
- Oh, yes, I saw. Poor child.

401
00:30:56.489 --> 00:30:59.493
Could I borrow your guitar?
I thought maybe I could cheer her up.

402
00:30:59.576 --> 00:31:03.171
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you. Thank you.

403
00:31:09.419 --> 00:31:11.342
- Hi.
- Hi.

404
00:31:11.421 --> 00:31:13.844
Do you mind if I talk to your daughter?

405
00:31:13.923 --> 00:31:16.051
Why, I think that'd be nice.

406
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.767
Hi, I'm Randy.

407
00:31:20.054 --> 00:31:21.351
I'm Lisa.

408
00:31:21.431 --> 00:31:23.183
Oh, you have a guitar.

409
00:31:23.474 --> 00:31:24.521
Mmm-hmm.

410
00:31:24.601 --> 00:31:26.353
I thought maybe
you'd like to hear a song.

411
00:31:27.854 --> 00:31:29.151
I'd love to.

412
00:31:29.355 --> 00:31:30.447
Okay.

413
00:31:30.523 --> 00:31:32.275
Let's see.

414
00:31:32.358 --> 00:31:34.486
This is one of my favorites.

415
00:31:38.448 --> 00:31:42.703
<i>I traveled the banks
of the River of Jordan</i>

416
00:31:43.244 --> 00:31:47.215
<i>To find where it flows to the sea</i>

417
00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:52.216
<i>I looked in the eyes
of the cold and the hungry</i>

418
00:31:52.795 --> 00:31:56.800
<i>And I saw that I was looking at me</i>

419
00:31:58.676 --> 00:32:02.931
<i>And I wanted to know
if life had a purpose</i>

420
00:32:03.056 --> 00:32:06.356
<i>And what it all means in the end</i>

421
00:32:06.893 --> 00:32:10.989
<i>In the silence I listened
to voices inside me</i>

422
00:32:11.856 --> 00:32:15.781
<i>And they told me again and again</i>

423
00:32:17.237 --> 00:32:20.582
<i>There is only one river</i>

424
00:32:20.657 --> 00:32:23.911
<i>There is only one sea</i>

425
00:32:23.993 --> 00:32:27.122
<i>And it flows through you</i>

426
00:32:27.205 --> 00:32:30.334
<i>And it flows through me</i>

427
00:32:30.416 --> 00:32:33.590
<i>There is only one people</i>

428
00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:36.890
<i>We are one and the same</i>

429
00:32:37.048 --> 00:32:40.427
<i>We are all one spirit</i>

430
00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:43.854
<i>One name</i>

431
00:32:44.222 --> 00:32:46.145
<i>We are the father</i>

432
00:32:46.599 --> 00:32:48.351
<i>We are one</i>

433
00:32:49.852 --> 00:32:51.354
<i>We are one</i>

434
00:32:53.356 --> 00:32:56.075
<i>We are one</i>

435
00:33:01.781 --> 00:33:03.249
A little late tonight.
We've been waiting for you.

436
00:33:03.324 --> 00:33:05.622
- Who wants to be first?
- Go ahead, Clarence. I got it.

437
00:33:05.702 --> 00:33:07.545
- Okay.
- How's the weather?

438
00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:10.715
Not so good.
We got some heavy stuff ahead of us.

439
00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:13.134
It might get rough again
unless we can climb on top.

440
00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:15.087
Yeah, after the war,

441
00:33:15.169 --> 00:33:17.797
I just wanted to get
as far away from things as possible,

442
00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.759
so Elaine and I joined the Peace Corps.

443
00:33:22.343 --> 00:33:24.721
We were assigned to an isolated tribe.

444
00:33:24.846 --> 00:33:26.314
The Molombos.

445
00:33:27.098 --> 00:33:29.100
They'd never seen Americans before.

446
00:33:43.614 --> 00:33:45.332
<i>It was really a challenge
during the year,</i>

447
00:33:45.408 --> 00:33:48.252
<i>introducing them to our Western culture.</i>

448
00:33:53.166 --> 00:33:55.134
<i>At first they didn't know
what to think of us.</i>

449
00:33:55.251 --> 00:33:57.595
<i>But soon, we gained their trust.</i>

450
00:34:06.763 --> 00:34:09.983
It'll help you better prepare storing foods

451
00:34:10.058 --> 00:34:13.483
for the up and coming monsoon months.

452
00:34:13.561 --> 00:34:18.362
Also, Supperware products
are ideal for storing leftovers

453
00:34:18.441 --> 00:34:21.285
to help stretch your food dollar.

454
00:34:22.111 --> 00:34:27.959
This 2-quart Seals-M-Rite container
keeps hot dog buns fresh for days.

455
00:34:28.701 --> 00:34:30.624
<i>You must understand,
these people had been</i>

456
00:34:30.703 --> 00:34:32.876
<i>completely isolated from civilization.</i>

457
00:34:33.748 --> 00:34:36.297
<i>No one had ever outlined
a physical fitness program for them,</i>

458
00:34:36.376 --> 00:34:38.470
<i>and they had no athletic equipment.</i>

459
00:34:38.544 --> 00:34:40.342
<i>I started them on simple calisthenics,</i>

460
00:34:40.421 --> 00:34:43.049
<i>then gradually worked them up
to rudimentary game skills.</i>

461
00:34:43.132 --> 00:34:45.555
<i>And finally,
advanced competitive theory</i>

462
00:34:46.386 --> 00:34:49.014
<i>I was patient with them,
and they were eager to learn.</i>

463
00:34:49.305 --> 00:34:50.978
<i>They seemed to enjoy themselves.</i>

464
00:34:51.474 --> 00:34:54.193
<i>It was probably due to the advanced
American teaching techniques</i>

465
00:34:54.268 --> 00:34:56.987
<i>that we were able to bridge
the generations of isolation</i>

466
00:34:57.063 --> 00:34:59.612
<i>and communicate so successfully
with the Molombos.</i>

467
00:35:06.614 --> 00:35:08.332
I think they're getting the hang of it.

468
00:35:08.408 --> 00:35:10.581
When we re-enlist,
I'll teach them baseball.

469
00:35:11.119 --> 00:35:13.542
Ted, I don't wanna stay here.

470
00:35:13.663 --> 00:35:17.884
It's time for us to go back home
to the plans we made before the war.

471
00:35:20.044 --> 00:35:22.968
A lot of people made plans
before the war.

472
00:35:23.047 --> 00:35:24.139
Like George Zipp.

473
00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.473
<i>It was at that moment that I first realized</i>

474
00:35:31.556 --> 00:35:34.230
<i>Elaine had doubts
about our relationship.</i>

475
00:35:34.308 --> 00:35:38.188
<i>And that, as much as anything else,
led to my drinking problem.</i>

476
00:35:39.272 --> 00:35:40.945
<i>We did come back to the States.</i>

477
00:35:41.691 --> 00:35:43.568
I tried a number of jobs.

478
00:35:43.651 --> 00:35:46.996
Well, I could go on for hours,
but I'd probably start to bore you.

479
00:35:47.071 --> 00:35:48.994
You know, I really couldn't blame Elaine.

480
00:35:49.073 --> 00:35:50.871
She wanted a career.

481
00:35:56.205 --> 00:35:58.128
I can't stand it.

482
00:35:58.207 --> 00:35:59.629
What is it?

483
00:35:59.709 --> 00:36:01.882
- Yes?
- Oh, it's my stomach.

484
00:36:03.045 --> 00:36:06.299
I haven't felt this awful
since we saw that Ronald Reagan film.

485
00:36:07.133 --> 00:36:09.761
I'll see if I can find some Dramamine.

486
00:36:17.393 --> 00:36:20.237
Captain, one of the woman passengers
is very sick.

487
00:36:20.938 --> 00:36:21.939
Airsick?

488
00:36:22.023 --> 00:36:24.902
<i>I think so,
but I've never seen it so acute.</i>

489
00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:30.081
Find out if there's a doctor on board
as quietly as you can.

490
00:36:33.075 --> 00:36:35.954
Joey, have you ever been in a...

491
00:36:36.037 --> 00:36:37.789
In a Turkish prison?

492
00:36:39.957 --> 00:36:43.052
I shouldn't have had
that second cup of coffee.

493
00:36:54.305 --> 00:36:56.307
<i>Jim never vomits at home.</i>

494
00:36:58.017 --> 00:37:00.520
I'm sorry I had to wake you.
I'm just looking for a doctor.

495
00:37:00.603 --> 00:37:02.355
There's nothing to worry about.

496
00:37:02.438 --> 00:37:03.530
Stewardess?

497
00:37:03.606 --> 00:37:06.450
I think the man sitting next to me
is a doctor.

498
00:37:06.526 --> 00:37:09.120
Sir? Excuse me, sir.
I'm sorry I have to wake you.

499
00:37:09.195 --> 00:37:10.538
Are you a doctor?

500
00:37:10.613 --> 00:37:11.785
That's right.

501
00:37:11.864 --> 00:37:13.582
We have some passengers
that are very sick.

502
00:37:13.658 --> 00:37:16.912
- Could you come take a look at them?
- Yes. Yes, of course.

503
00:37:26.546 --> 00:37:28.469
Let me see your tongue.

504
00:37:59.036 --> 00:38:01.038
I'll be back in a minute.

505
00:38:06.168 --> 00:38:08.762
You'd better tell the captain,
we've got to land as soon as we can.

506
00:38:08.838 --> 00:38:10.465
This woman has to be gotten
to a hospital.

507
00:38:10.548 --> 00:38:12.391
A hospital, what is it?

508
00:38:12.466 --> 00:38:15.265
It's a big building with patients.
But that's not important right now.

509
00:38:15.344 --> 00:38:18.439
- Tell the captain I must speak to him.
- Certainly.

510
00:38:25.521 --> 00:38:27.819
Victor, we're running into
some heavy weather, can you...

511
00:38:27.898 --> 00:38:29.525
Roger, take over!

512
00:38:52.381 --> 00:38:55.976
- Captain, how soon can you land?
- I can't tell.

513
00:38:56.052 --> 00:38:59.056
- You can tell me, I'm a doctor.
- No, I mean, I'm just not sure.

514
00:38:59.138 --> 00:39:03.143
- Well, can't you take a guess?
- Well, not for another two hours.

515
00:39:04.226 --> 00:39:06.320
You can't take a guess
for another two hours?

516
00:39:06.395 --> 00:39:08.568
No, no, no. I mean,
we can't land for another two hours.

517
00:39:08.648 --> 00:39:10.696
Fog has closed down everything
this side of the mountains.

518
00:39:10.775 --> 00:39:13.324
We've got to get through to Chicago.

519
00:39:20.451 --> 00:39:22.294
Get him out of there!

520
00:39:48.104 --> 00:39:51.324
- What is it, Doctor? What's going on?
- I'm not sure.

521
00:39:51.399 --> 00:39:54.869
I haven't seen anything like this
since the Anita Bryant concert.

522
00:39:54.944 --> 00:39:56.912
What was it we had for dinner tonight?

523
00:39:57.113 --> 00:39:59.616
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.

524
00:40:00.157 --> 00:40:03.377
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
What did he have?

525
00:40:03.744 --> 00:40:05.087
He had fish.

526
00:40:05.162 --> 00:40:07.381
Doctor, there are two more sick people,

527
00:40:07.456 --> 00:40:09.174
and the rest of the passengers
are worried.

528
00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.002
I'll take care of the passengers.

529
00:40:11.627 --> 00:40:14.801
Find out what the two sick people
had for dinner.

530
00:40:15.256 --> 00:40:16.724
This is Captain Oveur speaking.

531
00:40:16.799 --> 00:40:20.178
<i>It's been a little bumpy up here,
but we'll be past it in a few minutes.</i>

532
00:40:20.261 --> 00:40:21.888
<i>A couple points of interest.</i>

533
00:40:21.971 --> 00:40:25.225
<i>We're now flying over Hoover Dam,
and a little later on,</i>

534
00:40:25.307 --> 00:40:27.480
<i>we'll pass just to the south
of the Grand Canyon.</i>

535
00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.404
<i>Meanwhile, relax
and enjoy your flight, okay?</i>

536
00:40:32.314 --> 00:40:34.908
Chicago, this is flight 209'er.

537
00:40:34.984 --> 00:40:36.486
We're in trouble.

538
00:40:36.569 --> 00:40:39.163
We've got to have all traffic
below us cleared,

539
00:40:39.238 --> 00:40:41.616
and I want a priority approach
and landing in Chicago.

540
00:40:45.286 --> 00:40:48.039
- Yes?
- Stewardess. My husband's very sick.

541
00:40:48.122 --> 00:40:49.544
Can you do something, please?

542
00:40:49.623 --> 00:40:53.253
Well, the doctor will be
with you in just a moment.

543
00:40:53.335 --> 00:40:55.633
One thing, do you know
what he had for dinner?

544
00:40:55.713 --> 00:40:57.966
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?

545
00:40:58.048 --> 00:40:59.925
It's nothing to be alarmed about.

546
00:41:00.009 --> 00:41:02.478
We'll be back to you very quickly.

547
00:41:09.435 --> 00:41:11.437
Dr. Rumack, Mr. Hammen ate fish,

548
00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.568
and Randy said
there are five more cases,

549
00:41:13.647 --> 00:41:15.399
and they all had fish, too.

550
00:41:15.483 --> 00:41:17.326
And the copilot had fish.

551
00:41:17.401 --> 00:41:20.655
- What did the navigator have?
- He had fish.

552
00:41:20.738 --> 00:41:23.617
All right.
Now we know what we're up against.

553
00:41:23.699 --> 00:41:26.248
Every passenger on this plane
who had fish for dinner

554
00:41:26.327 --> 00:41:29.422
will become violently ill
in the next half-hour.

555
00:41:29.705 --> 00:41:31.707
Just how serious is it, Doctor?

556
00:41:32.166 --> 00:41:33.588
Extremely serious.

557
00:41:33.667 --> 00:41:37.137
It starts with a slight fever,
dryness of the throat.

558
00:41:37.213 --> 00:41:39.011
As the virus penetrates
the red blood cells,

559
00:41:39.089 --> 00:41:43.060
the victim becomes dizzy,
begins to experience an itching, a rash.

560
00:41:43.135 --> 00:41:45.854
From there, the poison goes to work
on the central nervous system,

561
00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:50.481
causing severe muscle spasms,
followed by the inevitable drooling.

562
00:41:50.559 --> 00:41:53.312
At this point,
the entire digestive system collapses,

563
00:41:53.395 --> 00:41:56.319
accompanied by
uncontrollable flatulence...

564
00:41:56.398 --> 00:41:57.945
Until finally the poor bastard

565
00:41:58.067 --> 00:42:01.241
is reduced to a quivering,
wasted piece of jelly.

566
00:42:19.964 --> 00:42:22.717
Turn on automatic pilot.

567
00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.638
Automatic pilot. Automatic pilot.

568
00:42:27.096 --> 00:42:28.143
There it is!

569
00:42:36.772 --> 00:42:39.070
I'll go back to the passengers.

570
00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:44.363
<i>Come in, 209'er.
This is Chicago.</i>

571
00:42:44.446 --> 00:42:46.574
<i>Flight 209'er, come in.</i>

572
00:42:48.033 --> 00:42:50.536
This is Elaine Dickinson.
I'm the stewardess.

573
00:42:50.619 --> 00:42:52.417
Captain Oveur's passed out on the floor,

574
00:42:52.496 --> 00:42:54.544
and we've lost the copilot
and navigator, too.

575
00:42:54.623 --> 00:42:56.216
We're in terrible trouble. Over.

576
00:42:56.292 --> 00:42:57.589
<i>Roger, Elaine, roger.
I read you.</i>

577
00:42:57.668 --> 00:42:59.636
<i>This is Steve McCroskey
at Chicago Air Control.</i>

578
00:42:59.712 --> 00:43:02.056
Get back to you in a minute.
Hold all takeoffs.

579
00:43:02.131 --> 00:43:04.725
I don't want another plane in the air.
When the 508 reports,

580
00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.177
- bring it straight in.
- Yes, sir.

581
00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:08.388
Put out a general bulletin
to suspend all meal service

582
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:10.063
on flights out of Los Angeles.

583
00:43:10.139 --> 00:43:12.107
Tell all dispatchers
to remain at their posts.

584
00:43:12.182 --> 00:43:13.274
It's gonna be a long night.

585
00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:14.852
- How about some coffee, Johnny?
- No, thanks.

586
00:43:14.935 --> 00:43:17.188
I want the weather on every landing field
this side of the Rockies

587
00:43:17.271 --> 00:43:18.488
no matter what the size.

588
00:43:18.564 --> 00:43:20.066
Do you understand?

589
00:43:20.149 --> 00:43:23.528
Anyplace. Anyplace where there's
a chance to land that plane!

590
00:43:23.611 --> 00:43:27.366
Stan, go upstairs to the tower
and get a runway diagram.

591
00:43:27.448 --> 00:43:30.748
Terry, check down the field
for emergency equipment.

592
00:43:30.826 --> 00:43:33.170
Chief, we got fog,
right down to the deck,

593
00:43:33.245 --> 00:43:34.963
every place east of the Rockies.

594
00:43:35.039 --> 00:43:36.382
There's no possible place they can land.

595
00:43:36.457 --> 00:43:39.085
They'll have to come
through to Chicago.

596
00:43:39.168 --> 00:43:41.762
Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit smoking.

597
00:43:41.837 --> 00:43:43.760
I want the best available man on this.

598
00:43:43.839 --> 00:43:45.682
A man who knows
that plane inside and out

599
00:43:45.758 --> 00:43:47.101
and won't crack under pressure.

600
00:43:47.176 --> 00:43:48.974
How about Mr. Rogers?

601
00:43:52.598 --> 00:43:54.271
Get me Rex Kramer.

602
00:44:00.022 --> 00:44:03.447
<i>Elaine, right next to the throttle
is the air-speed gauge.</i>

603
00:44:03.525 --> 00:44:05.072
<i>What speed does it indicate?</i>

604
00:44:07.321 --> 00:44:09.665
520 miles per hour.

605
00:44:10.199 --> 00:44:13.373
Good. Very good.
Now check your altitude.

606
00:44:13.827 --> 00:44:17.627
That's the dial just below and to
the right of the air-speed indicator.

607
00:44:18.624 --> 00:44:20.342
35,000 feet.

608
00:44:21.168 --> 00:44:23.421
No, wait. 34,000 feet.

609
00:44:23.879 --> 00:44:27.383
No, it's dropping. It's dropping fast.

610
00:44:28.092 --> 00:44:29.935
Why is it doing that?

611
00:44:32.721 --> 00:44:36.396
Oh, my God!
The automatic pilot, it's deflating!

612
00:44:37.142 --> 00:44:38.894
Now, Elaine, don't panic.

613
00:44:39.395 --> 00:44:42.274
On the belt line of the automatic pilot,
there is a hollow tube.

614
00:44:42.481 --> 00:44:46.577
<i>Now that is the manual inflation nozzle.
Pull it out and blow on it.</i>

615
00:44:51.407 --> 00:44:53.876
What the hell's going on up there?

616
00:45:49.131 --> 00:45:50.849
Elaine?

617
00:45:50.924 --> 00:45:52.301
Yes, Doctor?

618
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:56.063
Elaine, you're a member of this crew.

619
00:45:56.138 --> 00:45:59.108
- Can you face some unpleasant facts?
- No.

620
00:45:59.183 --> 00:46:02.528
All right. Unless I get all those people
to a hospital quickly,

621
00:46:02.603 --> 00:46:04.526
I can't even be sure of saving their lives.

622
00:46:04.605 --> 00:46:07.654
Now, is there anyone on board
who can land this plane?

623
00:46:08.484 --> 00:46:09.485
Well...

624
00:46:13.322 --> 00:46:15.120
No, no one I know of.

625
00:46:15.741 --> 00:46:17.914
I think you ought to know
what our chances are.

626
00:46:17.993 --> 00:46:21.088
The life of everyone on board
depends upon just one thing.

627
00:46:21.163 --> 00:46:24.258
Finding someone back there
who can not only fly this plane,

628
00:46:24.333 --> 00:46:26.176
but who didn't have fish for dinner.

629
00:46:37.679 --> 00:46:41.183
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your stewardess speaking.

630
00:46:41.266 --> 00:46:43.143
We regret any inconvenience

631
00:46:43.227 --> 00:46:45.650
the sudden cabin movement
might have caused.

632
00:46:45.729 --> 00:46:49.199
<i>This is due to periodic air pockets
we encounter.</i>

633
00:46:49.274 --> 00:46:51.493
<i>There's no reason to become alarmed,</i>

634
00:46:51.568 --> 00:46:54.071
<i>and we hope you enjoy
the rest of your flight.</i>

635
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:58.876
By the way, is there anyone on board
who knows how to fly a plane?

636
00:47:28.981 --> 00:47:31.700
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline.
I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.

637
00:47:31.775 --> 00:47:34.528
Yes. Come in, Paul. Rex'll be right out.

638
00:47:37.906 --> 00:47:40.329
Shep, sit. Sit.

639
00:47:40.409 --> 00:47:43.208
So, I understand you have
a real emergency down there.

640
00:47:43.704 --> 00:47:44.876
Yeah, something like that.

641
00:47:44.955 --> 00:47:48.505
But as I say, they didn't have time
to tell me very much.

642
00:47:50.085 --> 00:47:52.008
Shep, no!

643
00:47:52.087 --> 00:47:55.466
I'll bet you have exciting things
happen all the time down there.

644
00:47:55.799 --> 00:47:57.972
Well, the airline business
does have its moments,

645
00:47:58.051 --> 00:48:00.804
but after a while
you begin to get used to it.

646
00:48:02.514 --> 00:48:04.061
Shep, come!

647
00:48:06.018 --> 00:48:08.942
He gets so excited
when new people are here.

648
00:48:09.563 --> 00:48:11.440
Are you a pilot yourself?

649
00:48:11.523 --> 00:48:14.902
No, I'm in...
A training program.

650
00:48:14.985 --> 00:48:16.862
It's unbelievable!

651
00:48:16.945 --> 00:48:18.868
Just unbelievable!

652
00:48:18.947 --> 00:48:21.666
How many times I've warned
those people about food inspection.

653
00:48:21.742 --> 00:48:24.621
You'd think after all these years,
someone would listen to you.

654
00:48:24.703 --> 00:48:27.752
Oh, well. Airport management,
the FAA and the airlines,

655
00:48:30.167 --> 00:48:32.090
they're all cheats and liars!

656
00:48:32.169 --> 00:48:34.592
All right, let's get out of here.

657
00:48:41.845 --> 00:48:42.937
I'm sorry to bother you.

658
00:48:43.013 --> 00:48:46.313
I was just looking for someone
with flying experience.

659
00:48:46.934 --> 00:48:50.154
When they built those roads,
they had no thought of drainage in mind.

660
00:48:50.229 --> 00:48:54.029
So we had to take a special jeep
up to the main road.

661
00:48:55.067 --> 00:48:56.660
In fact, we were lucky to even get a jeep

662
00:48:56.735 --> 00:49:00.911
since just the day before,
only one that we had broke down.

663
00:49:00.989 --> 00:49:02.912
It had a bad axle.

664
00:49:02.991 --> 00:49:04.459
Excuse me, sir.

665
00:49:04.534 --> 00:49:06.081
There's been a little problem
in the cockpit...

666
00:49:06.161 --> 00:49:08.084
The cockpit! What is it?

667
00:49:08.163 --> 00:49:10.632
It's the little room in the front
of the plane where the pilots sit.

668
00:49:10.707 --> 00:49:11.924
But that's not important right now.

669
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.593
You see, the first officer is ill,

670
00:49:13.669 --> 00:49:16.639
and the captain needs someone
to help him with the radio.

671
00:49:16.713 --> 00:49:19.717
Do you know anything about planes?

672
00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:23.395
Well, I flew in the war,
but that was years ago.

673
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:25.097
I wouldn't know anything about it.

674
00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:27.399
Well, would you go up? Please?

675
00:49:44.741 --> 00:49:46.368
The stewardess said that...

676
00:49:48.912 --> 00:49:50.038
Both pilots?

677
00:49:50.455 --> 00:49:52.378
Can you fly this plane and land it?

678
00:49:53.458 --> 00:49:54.926
Surely you can't be serious?

679
00:49:55.002 --> 00:49:57.676
I am serious. And don't call me Shirley.

680
00:49:58.755 --> 00:50:02.601
Doctor, I've checked everyone.
Mr. Striker's the only one.

681
00:50:02.718 --> 00:50:04.595
What flying experience have you had?

682
00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:06.768
Well, I flew single-engine fighters
in the Air Force,

683
00:50:06.847 --> 00:50:08.815
but this plane has four engines.

684
00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:11.564
It's an entirely different
kind of flying altogether.

685
00:50:12.519 --> 00:50:15.113
It's an entirely different kind of flying.

686
00:50:17.607 --> 00:50:20.451
Besides, I haven't touched
any kind of plane in six years.

687
00:50:20.902 --> 00:50:23.951
Mr. Striker, I know nothing about flying,

688
00:50:24.031 --> 00:50:26.159
but there's one thing I do know.

689
00:50:26.241 --> 00:50:29.336
You're the only one on this plane
who can possibly fly it.

690
00:50:29.411 --> 00:50:31.288
You're the only chance we've got.

691
00:51:12.162 --> 00:51:14.711
Yeah, that's right. That's right.

692
00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:16.463
No, that's what I said. You heard me.

693
00:51:16.583 --> 00:51:18.551
Tell Omaha to acknowledge
and stand by.

694
00:51:18.627 --> 00:51:22.507
Every piece of emergency equipment
you can reach.

695
00:51:22.589 --> 00:51:24.341
Alert rescue units
at every mile of the way.

696
00:51:24.424 --> 00:51:26.017
- From here to the Rockies.
- Chief?

697
00:51:27.427 --> 00:51:28.474
We'll need a pre-landing flight check.

698
00:51:28.553 --> 00:51:30.476
Tell them I'm in the dispatch office,
and I want it here fast.

699
00:51:30.555 --> 00:51:31.556
It's your wife.

700
00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:34.063
I want the kids in bed by 9:00.
I want the dog fed, the yard watered,

701
00:51:34.142 --> 00:51:35.735
and the gate locked.
And get a note to the milkman.

702
00:51:35.811 --> 00:51:37.563
No more cheese!

703
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:42.192
Where the hell is Kramer?

704
00:51:50.742 --> 00:51:54.713
No, we can't do that.
The risk of a flameout's too great.

705
00:51:54.788 --> 00:51:57.086
Keep them at 24,000.

706
00:51:57.165 --> 00:51:58.417
No, feet.

707
00:52:01.711 --> 00:52:03.930
One of the passengers
is gonna land that plane.

708
00:52:04.005 --> 00:52:06.007
Is that possible?

709
00:52:06.091 --> 00:52:07.764
Possible. It's a 100-to-1 shot.

710
00:52:10.053 --> 00:52:12.772
1,000-to-1. I know this guy.

711
00:52:12.848 --> 00:52:13.940
- You do?
- Asshole!

712
00:52:14.015 --> 00:52:16.143
- Who is it?
- Name's Ted Striker.

713
00:52:16.226 --> 00:52:17.899
I flew with him during the war.

714
00:52:18.186 --> 00:52:20.439
And that won't make my job
any easier tonight.

715
00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:24.990
Ted Striker was a crack flight leader
up to a point.

716
00:52:25.444 --> 00:52:26.991
He was one of those men who...

717
00:52:27.070 --> 00:52:30.449
Well, let's just say, felt too much inside.

718
00:52:30.615 --> 00:52:32.663
Maybe you know the kind.

719
00:52:32.826 --> 00:52:35.796
He went all to pieces
one particular mission.

720
00:52:36.872 --> 00:52:39.751
Just hope that doesn't happen tonight.

721
00:52:46.923 --> 00:52:48.140
Let's see.

722
00:52:48.216 --> 00:52:51.095
Altitude, 24,000 feet.

723
00:52:52.554 --> 00:52:53.931
Level flight.

724
00:52:54.014 --> 00:52:55.857
Speed, 520 knots.

725
00:52:56.558 --> 00:52:58.560
Course, zero-niner-zero.

726
00:52:58.894 --> 00:53:00.646
Trim, mixture.

727
00:53:00.729 --> 00:53:02.697
Wash, soap, rinse, spin.

728
00:53:06.568 --> 00:53:10.539
Ted! What are you doing here?
You can't fly this plane.

729
00:53:11.239 --> 00:53:12.991
That's what I've been
trying to tell these people.

730
00:53:13.074 --> 00:53:14.291
Elaine,

731
00:53:14.367 --> 00:53:17.371
I don't have time to say this gently,
so I'll be very direct.

732
00:53:17.454 --> 00:53:20.128
Everyone in this plane
is in a desperate situation.

733
00:53:20.207 --> 00:53:22.926
Mr. Striker is the only hope we've got.

734
00:53:27.422 --> 00:53:29.095
Those are the flaps.

735
00:53:29.174 --> 00:53:30.926
This is the thrust.

736
00:53:32.093 --> 00:53:34.721
This must turn on the landing lights.

737
00:53:48.610 --> 00:53:50.237
Mayday! Mayday!

738
00:53:50.445 --> 00:53:52.743
<i>- Mayday!
- Mayday? What the hell is that for?</i>

739
00:53:52.822 --> 00:53:54.574
Mayday?
Why, that's the Russian New Year.

740
00:53:54.658 --> 00:53:56.581
We'll have a big parade.
We'll serve hot hors d'oeuvres.

741
00:54:08.004 --> 00:54:10.052
I can't stand it anymore.

742
00:54:10.131 --> 00:54:13.055
I've gotta get out of here.
I've got to get out of here!

743
00:54:13.134 --> 00:54:14.807
Calm down. Get a hold of yourself!

744
00:54:14.886 --> 00:54:16.604
Stewardess, please, let me handle this.

745
00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:18.148
I've gotta get out.

746
00:54:19.766 --> 00:54:23.111
Calm down, now get back to your seat.
I'll take care of this problem now.

747
00:54:23.186 --> 00:54:25.188
Calm down! Get a hold of yourself.

748
00:54:25.272 --> 00:54:27.650
Doctor, you're wanted on the phone.

749
00:54:27.732 --> 00:54:30.235
Everything's gonna be all right, please!

750
00:54:30.318 --> 00:54:32.992
- Sister, please. I'll handle this.
- Just try and get a hold of yourself.

751
00:54:33.113 --> 00:54:35.741
I've gotta get out of here!
Ahhh!

752
00:54:35.824 --> 00:54:38.043
Out of here! I've gotta get out of here!

753
00:54:38.868 --> 00:54:41.838
Excuse me,
we'd like you to have this flower.

754
00:54:42.998 --> 00:54:45.376
Excuse me, sir, would you...

755
00:54:45.458 --> 00:54:46.880
Donations for Reverend Moon?

756
00:54:48.378 --> 00:54:49.880
Jews for Jesus?

757
00:54:50.005 --> 00:54:52.053
Read about Jehovah's Witness.

758
00:54:52.132 --> 00:54:53.133
Ahhh!

759
00:54:53.258 --> 00:54:54.976
How about Buddhism?

760
00:54:56.177 --> 00:54:57.269
Help Jerry's kids?

761
00:54:58.221 --> 00:54:59.393
Scientology?

762
00:54:59.472 --> 00:55:00.769
More nuclear power?

763
00:55:07.814 --> 00:55:09.487
<i>Your attention please.</i>

764
00:55:09.566 --> 00:55:12.319
<i>No-frills passengers now arriving.</i>

765
00:55:12.402 --> 00:55:15.076
<i>Please have your baggage
claim checks ready</i>

766
00:55:15.155 --> 00:55:18.125
<i>to show attendant
upon leaving the terminal.</i>

767
00:55:18.825 --> 00:55:21.749
I know, but this guy doing the flying
has no airline experience at all.

768
00:55:21.828 --> 00:55:25.082
He's a menace to himself
and everything else in the air.

769
00:55:25.165 --> 00:55:26.337
Yes, birds too.

770
00:55:26.416 --> 00:55:29.886
Okay, okay, he's a terrible risk.
But what other choice have we got?

771
00:55:29.961 --> 00:55:32.555
That's the whole story there, Rex.
Everything we know.

772
00:55:34.215 --> 00:55:36.968
All right, Steve, let's face a few facts.

773
00:55:37.052 --> 00:55:39.146
As you know, I flew with this man,
Striker, during the war.

774
00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:41.643
He's gonna have enough on his mind
without worrying about those times

775
00:55:41.723 --> 00:55:43.521
when things weren't so good.

776
00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:45.648
Well, right now, things aren't so good.

777
00:55:45.935 --> 00:55:47.357
Let me tell you something, Steve.

778
00:55:47.437 --> 00:55:49.235
Ted Striker was
a top-notch squadron leader,

779
00:55:49.314 --> 00:55:51.237
a long time ago.

780
00:55:51.316 --> 00:55:55.241
Look, Rex, I want you to get on the horn
and talk that guy down.

781
00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:58.620
Now, you're gonna have to let him
get the feel of that airplane on the way.

782
00:55:58.698 --> 00:56:00.166
Then you'll have to talk him
onto the approach.

783
00:56:00.241 --> 00:56:03.711
So help me, you'll have to talk him
right down to the ground!

784
00:56:04.829 --> 00:56:05.876
Very well.

785
00:56:05.955 --> 00:56:09.550
- Put Striker on the speaker.
- Okay, use my radio over there.

786
00:56:11.044 --> 00:56:14.344
Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit drinking.

787
00:56:16.091 --> 00:56:18.185
Now, you can work them
direct from here, Captain.

788
00:56:18.259 --> 00:56:19.431
Thanks.

789
00:56:21.429 --> 00:56:22.681
Striker?

790
00:56:24.057 --> 00:56:26.606
Striker, this is
Captain Rex Kramer speaking.

791
00:56:29.854 --> 00:56:33.404
Yes, Captain Kramer.
Read you loud and clear.

792
00:56:36.945 --> 00:56:39.619
All right. It's obvious you remember me.

793
00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:41.287
So, what do you say you and I

794
00:56:41.366 --> 00:56:44.040
just forget about everything
except what we have to do now?

795
00:56:44.661 --> 00:56:46.880
Let's not kid each other, Kramer.

796
00:56:46.955 --> 00:56:49.208
You know I've never flown
a bucket like this!

797
00:56:49.290 --> 00:56:51.292
I'm gonna need all the luck there is.

798
00:56:51.543 --> 00:56:53.216
Stand by, Striker.

799
00:56:54.087 --> 00:56:55.760
Our one hope is to build this man up.

800
00:56:55.839 --> 00:56:58.968
I've gotta give him
all the confidence I can.

801
00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:00.427
Striker?

802
00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:02.558
Have you ever flown
a multi-engine plane before?

803
00:57:02.637 --> 00:57:03.729
<i>No. Never.</i>

804
00:57:03.805 --> 00:57:05.853
Shit. This is a goddamn waste of time!

805
00:57:06.307 --> 00:57:07.559
<i>There's no way he can land this plane!</i>

806
00:57:07.642 --> 00:57:10.737
<i>Grab a hold of yourself.
You gotta talk him down. You gotta.</i>

807
00:57:10.812 --> 00:57:12.029
<i>Route him into Lake Michigan.</i>

808
00:57:12.105 --> 00:57:14.233
<i>At least he'll avoid
killing innocent people.</i>

809
00:57:14.524 --> 00:57:17.027
You're the only chance they've got!

810
00:57:19.654 --> 00:57:20.997
All right.

811
00:57:22.073 --> 00:57:24.826
Striker, you listen, and you listen close.

812
00:57:26.161 --> 00:57:28.255
Flying a plane is no different
than riding a bicycle.

813
00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:32.255
<i>Just a lot harder
to put baseball cards in the spokes.</i>

814
00:57:32.333 --> 00:57:34.131
<i>Now first, I want you to get
the feel of the plane.</i>

815
00:57:34.586 --> 00:57:37.510
Later, we'll run down
the landing procedure.

816
00:57:41.593 --> 00:57:44.813
All right, now I want you
to disengage the automatic pilot.

817
00:57:44.888 --> 00:57:47.266
But watch out you don't make
any violent control movements

818
00:57:47.348 --> 00:57:48.600
like you did in the fighter plane.

819
00:57:49.350 --> 00:57:52.604
All right, I'm going to unlock
the automatic pilot.

820
00:57:58.151 --> 00:58:00.279
<i>Just remember,
the controls will feel very heavy</i>

821
00:58:00.361 --> 00:58:01.863
<i>compared to a fighter.</i>

822
00:58:04.032 --> 00:58:07.036
<i>Don't worry about that.
It's perfectly normal.</i>

823
00:58:18.963 --> 00:58:20.465
<i>Now, one more thing,</i>

824
00:58:20.548 --> 00:58:22.175
<i>is somebody there
who can work the radio</i>

825
00:58:22.258 --> 00:58:24.431
<i>and leave you free for flying?</i>

826
00:58:24.511 --> 00:58:26.559
Yes. The stewardess is here with me.

827
00:58:26.638 --> 00:58:29.437
<i>Good. Have her sit in the copilot's seat.</i>

828
00:58:31.434 --> 00:58:34.688
Elaine, he wants you to sit
in the copilot's seat.

829
00:58:42.862 --> 00:58:45.411
What's going on?
We have a right to know the truth.

830
00:58:47.367 --> 00:58:49.415
All right, I'm gonna level with you all.

831
00:58:50.119 --> 00:58:52.713
The most important thing now
is that you remain calm.

832
00:58:52.831 --> 00:58:54.925
There is no reason to panic.

833
00:58:55.083 --> 00:58:58.303
Now, it is true
that one of the crew members is ill.

834
00:58:58.503 --> 00:58:59.971
Slightly ill.

835
00:59:00.588 --> 00:59:03.011
But the other two pilots are just fine.

836
00:59:03.091 --> 00:59:05.185
They're at the controls flying the plane,

837
00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:07.763
free to pursue a life
of religious fulfillment.

838
00:59:08.263 --> 00:59:09.890
The radio's all yours now.

839
00:59:09.973 --> 00:59:12.943
And keep an eye on that
number three engine gauge, over there.

840
00:59:13.101 --> 00:59:14.603
It's running a little hot.

841
00:59:17.981 --> 00:59:20.951
<i>Striker, before we start,
I'd like to say something.</i>

842
00:59:21.526 --> 00:59:24.871
I know that right now
things must look pretty rough up there,

843
00:59:24.946 --> 00:59:27.825
but if you do what I tell you,
when I tell you to do it,

844
00:59:28.074 --> 00:59:29.542
<i>there's no reason
why you shouldn't have</i>

845
00:59:29.617 --> 00:59:31.335
<i>complete confidence in your chances</i>

846
00:59:31.411 --> 00:59:34.130
<i>to come out of this thing alive
and in one piece.</i>

847
00:59:34.831 --> 00:59:36.799
Striker, what kind of weather
you in up there?

848
00:59:37.792 --> 00:59:39.009
Rain.

849
00:59:39.252 --> 00:59:40.344
And a little ice.

850
00:59:40.837 --> 00:59:42.180
And a little ice.

851
00:59:42.881 --> 00:59:43.973
How's it handling?

852
00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:47.803
It's sluggish, like a wet sponge.

853
00:59:48.136 --> 00:59:49.137
Sluggish,

854
00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:51.018
<i>like a wet sponge.</i>

855
00:59:51.097 --> 00:59:53.976
All right, Striker. You're doing just fine.

856
00:59:54.934 --> 00:59:58.313
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know
how much I hate his guts.

857
00:59:58.396 --> 01:00:02.492
It's a damn good thing you don't know
how much he hates your guts.

858
01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:10.708
Can I get you something?

859
01:00:11.743 --> 01:00:13.996
It's your mofo butter
laying me to the bone,

860
01:00:14.078 --> 01:00:15.625
jacking me up.

861
01:00:15.705 --> 01:00:17.127
Tightening me.

862
01:00:17.290 --> 01:00:18.758
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

863
01:00:18.833 --> 01:00:20.210
Cutty say he can't hang.

864
01:00:20.293 --> 01:00:21.670
Oh, stewardess?

865
01:00:21.753 --> 01:00:23.721
- I speak jive.
- Oh, good.

866
01:00:23.796 --> 01:00:26.925
He said that he's in great pain,

867
01:00:27.008 --> 01:00:28.601
and he wants to know
if you can help him.

868
01:00:28.676 --> 01:00:30.553
All right. Would you tell him to just relax,

869
01:00:30.637 --> 01:00:33.982
and I'll be back as soon as I can
with some medicine.

870
01:00:35.934 --> 01:00:37.356
Just hang loose, blood.

871
01:00:37.435 --> 01:00:39.984
She gonna catch up
on the rebound on the medi side.

872
01:00:40.063 --> 01:00:41.110
What it is, big mama?

873
01:00:41.189 --> 01:00:43.362
My mama didn't raise no dummies.
I dug her rap.

874
01:00:43.733 --> 01:00:45.110
Cut me some slack, Jack.

875
01:00:49.072 --> 01:00:51.040
Chump don't want the help,
chump don't get the help.

876
01:00:51.115 --> 01:00:52.617
Say he can't hang, say seven-up.

877
01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:55.499
Jive-ass dude
don't got no brains, anyhow.

878
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:04.303
Macias, get me Captain Oveur's wife
on the phone.

879
01:01:04.379 --> 01:01:05.471
We better let her know what's going on.

880
01:01:05.546 --> 01:01:08.891
Chief, this weather bulletin
just came off the wire.

881
01:01:11.052 --> 01:01:12.804
Johnny, what do you make out of this?

882
01:01:12.887 --> 01:01:14.059
This?

883
01:01:14.138 --> 01:01:18.063
Why, I could make a hat or a brooch.
Or a pterodactyl, could eat your...

884
01:01:27.902 --> 01:01:28.949
Hello?

885
01:01:29.028 --> 01:01:32.328
<i>- Mrs. Oveur?
- Yes, this is Mrs. Oveur.</i>

886
01:01:32.407 --> 01:01:34.830
<i>This is Ed Macias
calling from the airport.</i>

887
01:01:34.909 --> 01:01:37.287
<i>There's some trouble
on your husband's flight.</i>

888
01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:39.589
<i>Now, we don't know
how serious it is yet.</i>

889
01:01:39.664 --> 01:01:42.588
<i>But Steve McCroskey thought
you'd wanna get down here right away.</i>

890
01:01:42.667 --> 01:01:44.715
Yes, I'll be right down.

891
01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:50.967
I've gotta go to the airport.

892
01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:53.018
You can let yourself out the back door.

893
01:01:53.094 --> 01:01:54.937
There's juice in the refrigerator.

894
01:02:03.938 --> 01:02:06.566
Dr. Rumack says
the sick people are getting worse,

895
01:02:06.649 --> 01:02:08.902
and we're running out of time.

896
01:02:10.528 --> 01:02:12.155
<i>I've got to concentrate.</i>

897
01:02:12.238 --> 01:02:14.286
<i>Concentrate. Concentrate. Concentrate.</i>

898
01:02:14.365 --> 01:02:15.958
<i>I've got to concentrate.</i>

899
01:02:16.034 --> 01:02:18.628
<i>Concentrate. Concentrate. Concentrate.</i>

900
01:02:18.703 --> 01:02:21.877
<i>Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?</i>

901
01:02:21.956 --> 01:02:25.005
<i>Echo! Echo! Echo! Echo!</i>

902
01:02:25.126 --> 01:02:29.973
<i>Pinch hitting for Pedro Borbon,
Manny Mota.</i>

903
01:02:30.048 --> 01:02:31.345
<i>Mota. Mota. Mota.</i>

904
01:02:34.677 --> 01:02:38.272
- How you doing, honey?
- Jack, I'm so hot, I'm burning up.

905
01:02:38.639 --> 01:02:40.516
I'll turn on some air.

906
01:02:46.564 --> 01:02:48.032
What's going on up there?

907
01:02:48.107 --> 01:02:49.529
Close the window!

908
01:02:50.902 --> 01:02:53.246
Chicago, the passengers
are beginning to panic.

909
01:02:53.321 --> 01:02:55.039
When do we start down?

910
01:02:55.323 --> 01:02:59.328
Not just yet. We'll have you
in radar range any second now.

911
01:02:59.410 --> 01:03:02.914
I don't understand it. Should have been
in range 10 minutes ago.

912
01:03:02.997 --> 01:03:04.715
Gunderson, check the radar range.
Anything yet?

913
01:03:07.043 --> 01:03:09.262
It's about two more minutes, Chief.

914
01:03:13.174 --> 01:03:15.643
Two more minutes?
They could be miles off course.

915
01:03:15.718 --> 01:03:17.345
That's impossible.
They're on instruments.

916
01:03:21.641 --> 01:03:24.315
This is gonna be a real sweat.

917
01:03:24.393 --> 01:03:27.067
Gunderson, let me know
when you get anything.

918
01:03:27.146 --> 01:03:28.693
Got a cigarette, Nels?

919
01:03:28.773 --> 01:03:31.071
I can't take much more of this.

920
01:03:34.403 --> 01:03:37.953
Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit amphetamines.

921
01:03:39.033 --> 01:03:40.785
- Johnny, how about some more coffee.
- No, thanks.

922
01:03:41.202 --> 01:03:43.330
Chief, these reporters won't leave
without a statement.

923
01:03:43.412 --> 01:03:45.631
How much longer
can those passengers hold out?

924
01:03:45.706 --> 01:03:47.299
Half-an-hour, maybe 45 minutes.

925
01:03:47.375 --> 01:03:48.752
Who's flying the plane?

926
01:03:48.835 --> 01:03:51.509
One of the passengers,
but he's an experienced Air Force pilot

927
01:03:51.587 --> 01:03:53.260
who flew during the war,
so there's no cause for alarm.

928
01:03:53.339 --> 01:03:54.636
Hinshaw, take over.

929
01:03:54.715 --> 01:03:56.058
What kind of plane is it?

930
01:03:56.384 --> 01:04:00.139
Oh, it's a big, pretty white plane
with red stripes,

931
01:04:00.221 --> 01:04:03.771
curtains in the window, and wheels,
and it looks like a big Tylenol.

932
01:04:04.433 --> 01:04:06.982
Okay, boys. Let's get some pictures.

933
01:04:08.187 --> 01:04:10.235
I want the one
that'll block a wall.

934
01:04:14.193 --> 01:04:15.820
C-47, right? I love that one.

935
01:04:36.465 --> 01:04:38.183
<i>This bulletin just handed to me.</i>

936
01:04:38.259 --> 01:04:39.852
<i>Stricken airliner approaching Chicago.</i>

937
01:04:54.275 --> 01:04:57.404
Shana, they bought their tickets.

938
01:04:57.486 --> 01:04:59.784
They knew what they were getting into.

939
01:05:01.407 --> 01:05:03.626
I say let them crash.

940
01:05:19.675 --> 01:05:23.020
- Would you like a little whiskey, ma'am?
- Certainly not.

941
01:05:35.399 --> 01:05:37.401
How are the passengers doing?

942
01:05:37.485 --> 01:05:39.738
I won't deceive you, Mr. Striker.

943
01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:41.572
We're running out of time.

944
01:05:41.656 --> 01:05:43.158
Surely there must be something
you can do.

945
01:05:43.241 --> 01:05:45.744
I'm doing everything I can.

946
01:05:45.826 --> 01:05:48.124
And stop calling me Shirley.

947
01:05:48.329 --> 01:05:50.047
<i>R-E-S-P-E-C-T</i>

948
01:05:50.122 --> 01:05:51.874
<i>Find out what it means to me</i>

949
01:05:51.958 --> 01:05:53.835
<i>R-E-S-P-E-C-T</i>

950
01:05:53.918 --> 01:05:55.295
<i>Take out T-C-P</i>

951
01:05:55.378 --> 01:05:57.096
<i>Sock it to me, sock it to me
Sock it to me, sock it to me</i>

952
01:05:57.171 --> 01:05:58.297
<i>Sock it to me, sock it to me</i>

953
01:05:58.381 --> 01:06:00.475
<i>A little respect, just a little bit</i>

954
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:02.222
<i>Just a little bit</i>

955
01:06:11.978 --> 01:06:14.026
Randy, are you all right?

956
01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:17.408
Dr. Rumack.

957
01:06:18.359 --> 01:06:21.363
I'm scared. I've never been so scared.

958
01:06:22.863 --> 01:06:25.958
And besides, I'm 26 and I'm not married.

959
01:06:26.492 --> 01:06:29.917
Now, we're going to make it.
You've got to believe that.

960
01:06:29.996 --> 01:06:33.250
Dr. Rumack, do you have any idea
when we'll be landing?

961
01:06:33.332 --> 01:06:35.460
Pretty soon. How you bearing up?

962
01:06:35.543 --> 01:06:38.547
Well, to be honest,
I've never been so scared.

963
01:06:39.547 --> 01:06:41.766
But at least I have a husband.

964
01:06:54.603 --> 01:06:58.153
<i>Stay in formation.
Targets just ahead.</i>

965
01:06:58.232 --> 01:07:01.452
<i>Target should be clear
if you go in low enough.</i>

966
01:07:01.527 --> 01:07:07.500
<i>You'll have to decide.</i>

967
01:07:07.575 --> 01:07:11.170
<i>Stay in formation. Targets just ahead.</i>

968
01:07:11.245 --> 01:07:14.419
<i>Target should be clear
if you go in low enough.</i>

969
01:07:14.498 --> 01:07:19.720
<i>You'll have to decide.</i>

970
01:07:24.592 --> 01:07:26.014
Oh, rats!

971
01:07:26.969 --> 01:07:28.266
Lost number four.

972
01:07:28.596 --> 01:07:30.940
What happened, Ted?
What went wrong?

973
01:07:31.265 --> 01:07:34.735
The oil pressure.
I forgot to check the oil pressure.

974
01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:38.030
When Kramer hears about this,
the shit's gonna hit the fan.

975
01:07:40.483 --> 01:07:43.362
Watch that oil temperature.
What the hell's he doing up there?

976
01:07:43.444 --> 01:07:45.071
Striker, that plane can't land itself!

977
01:07:45.154 --> 01:07:46.531
It takes a pilot who can handle pressure!

978
01:07:46.614 --> 01:07:48.287
Ease off, Rex. He hasn't flown for years.

979
01:07:48.366 --> 01:07:50.368
It's not his fault.
Could happen to any pilot.

980
01:07:50.451 --> 01:07:51.873
It happened to Barbara Stanwyck.

981
01:07:51.952 --> 01:07:54.000
Can't push him too hard.
He might break.

982
01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:55.423
Gotta remember
who you're dealing with.

983
01:07:55.498 --> 01:07:58.502
Nick, Pete, Jared.
There's a fire in the barn!

984
01:08:00.127 --> 01:08:01.720
He's right.

985
01:08:01.796 --> 01:08:03.924
I can't take the pressure.

986
01:08:04.006 --> 01:08:05.974
I was crazy to think
I could land this plane.

987
01:08:06.050 --> 01:08:08.974
- But, Ted, you're the only...
- I don't care.

988
01:08:10.304 --> 01:08:12.181
I don't have what it takes.

989
01:08:12.264 --> 01:08:15.985
They'd be better off with someone
who'd never flown before.

990
01:08:25.736 --> 01:08:28.330
Bad news. The fog is getting thicker.

991
01:08:29.281 --> 01:08:32.455
And Leon's getting larger!

992
01:08:56.434 --> 01:08:59.654
I know what you're gonna say,
so save your breath.

993
01:09:01.730 --> 01:09:04.779
No. I don't have a thing to say.

994
01:09:05.568 --> 01:09:07.946
You've done the best you could.

995
01:09:08.028 --> 01:09:10.531
You really have. The best you could.

996
01:09:11.699 --> 01:09:14.043
You can't expect to win them all.

997
01:09:15.578 --> 01:09:17.455
But I wanna tell you something

998
01:09:17.538 --> 01:09:20.542
I've kept to myself through these years.

999
01:09:20.624 --> 01:09:23.377
I was in the war myself, Medical Corps.

1000
01:09:24.587 --> 01:09:25.964
Was on late duty one night

1001
01:09:26.046 --> 01:09:27.719
when they brought in
a badly wounded pilot

1002
01:09:27.798 --> 01:09:29.971
from one of the raids.

1003
01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:32.144
He could barely talk.

1004
01:09:32.219 --> 01:09:35.564
He looked up at me and, "Doc," he said,

1005
01:09:35.639 --> 01:09:39.815
"The odds were against us up there,
but we went in anyway.

1006
01:09:39.894 --> 01:09:41.771
"I'm glad.

1007
01:09:41.854 --> 01:09:44.277
"Captain made the right decision."

1008
01:09:46.025 --> 01:09:47.823
That pilot's name was George Zipp.

1009
01:09:50.237 --> 01:09:52.080
George Zipp said that?

1010
01:09:53.908 --> 01:09:57.333
The last thing he said to me,
"Doc," he said.

1011
01:09:57.411 --> 01:09:58.628
"Sometime,

1012
01:10:00.039 --> 01:10:02.167
"when the crew is up against it,

1013
01:10:02.249 --> 01:10:04.593
"and the breaks are beating the boys,

1014
01:10:04.752 --> 01:10:08.256
"tell them to get out there
and give it all they've got.

1015
01:10:09.256 --> 01:10:12.430
"And win just one for the Zipper.

1016
01:10:14.762 --> 01:10:17.185
"I don't know where I'll be then, Doc,"
he said.

1017
01:10:19.183 --> 01:10:22.187
"And I won't smell too good,
that's for sure."

1018
01:10:24.772 --> 01:10:26.319
Excuse me, Doc.

1019
01:10:27.608 --> 01:10:29.610
I've got a plane to land.

1020
01:10:37.493 --> 01:10:40.042
<i>All right, Striker,
you better stay up there for a bit.</i>

1021
01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:41.872
<i>Soon as the fog lifts, we'll bring you in.</i>

1022
01:10:41.956 --> 01:10:43.754
I'll take it, Elaine.

1023
01:10:52.007 --> 01:10:53.384
Listen to me, Kramer.

1024
01:10:53.467 --> 01:10:56.346
Dr. Rumack says
the sick people are in critical condition,

1025
01:10:56.428 --> 01:10:57.771
and every minute counts.

1026
01:10:57.846 --> 01:10:59.564
We've got to land now.

1027
01:11:00.099 --> 01:11:01.316
Don't be a fool, Striker.

1028
01:11:01.392 --> 01:11:02.769
You know what a landing
like this means.

1029
01:11:02.851 --> 01:11:03.977
You more than anybody.

1030
01:11:04.061 --> 01:11:05.654
I'm ordering you to stay up there!

1031
01:11:06.313 --> 01:11:07.860
No dice, Chicago.

1032
01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:10.864
I'm giving the orders,
and we're coming in.

1033
01:11:10.943 --> 01:11:14.664
I guess the foot's
on the other hand now, isn't it, Kramer?

1034
01:11:16.699 --> 01:11:19.043
He'll never make it in this soup.
Never, not one chance in a million.

1035
01:11:19.118 --> 01:11:22.918
I know, I know. But it's his ship now.
His command. He's in charge.

1036
01:11:22.997 --> 01:11:26.718
He's the boss, head man,
top dog, big cheese,

1037
01:11:26.792 --> 01:11:30.592
- the head honcho, number...
- Captain, look at this!

1038
01:11:30.671 --> 01:11:33.094
"Passengers certain to die."

1039
01:11:33.173 --> 01:11:35.426
"Airline negligent."

1040
01:11:35.509 --> 01:11:37.682
There's a sale at Penney's!

1041
01:11:40.556 --> 01:11:42.524
All right,
I'll need three men up in the tower.

1042
01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:43.977
You, Neubauer. You, Macias.

1043
01:11:44.351 --> 01:11:46.149
Me, John, big tree.

1044
01:11:47.021 --> 01:11:50.400
Stand by, Striker.
We're going to the tower. Good luck.

1045
01:11:50.524 --> 01:11:51.821
We're going to the tower.

1046
01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:53.994
The tower! The tower!

1047
01:11:54.069 --> 01:11:56.288
Rapunzel! Rapunzel!

1048
01:12:01.035 --> 01:12:02.287
Stewardess?

1049
01:12:02.369 --> 01:12:03.791
How soon do we land?

1050
01:12:03.871 --> 01:12:06.590
Oh, it won't be long now.
Try not to worry.

1051
01:12:20.304 --> 01:12:21.931
We're all ready, sir.

1052
01:12:22.014 --> 01:12:24.312
This is Captain McCroskey.
This is Captain Roberts.

1053
01:12:24.391 --> 01:12:26.314
Captain Kramer,
this is Captain Colosimo.

1054
01:12:26.393 --> 01:12:28.361
Captain Hinshaw, this is Captain Gatz.

1055
01:12:28.437 --> 01:12:29.984
Captain Kramer, Captain Gatz.

1056
01:12:30.064 --> 01:12:32.158
Captain Hinshaw, Captain Roberts.

1057
01:12:32.232 --> 01:12:34.326
All right, Colosimo, you work the relay.

1058
01:12:34.401 --> 01:12:36.699
Roberts, check all air traffic
within 5 miles.

1059
01:12:37.237 --> 01:12:38.659
Get that finger out of your ear.

1060
01:12:38.739 --> 01:12:40.787
You don't know where that finger's been.

1061
01:12:42.743 --> 01:12:43.744
Steve?

1062
01:12:44.536 --> 01:12:46.664
- Got a cigarette, Nelson?
- Now, Linda.

1063
01:12:46.747 --> 01:12:49.216
Your husband and the others are alive,
but unconscious.

1064
01:12:49.291 --> 01:12:51.134
Just like Gerald Ford.

1065
01:12:51.210 --> 01:12:53.258
Now, there's a chance
that we can save them

1066
01:12:53.337 --> 01:12:55.806
if Striker can get
that plane down in time.

1067
01:12:55.881 --> 01:12:58.976
- That isn't much of a chance, is it?
- I don't know, Linda, I don't know.

1068
01:12:59.051 --> 01:13:02.351
But we'll do everything we can.
Now excuse me, yeah?

1069
01:13:05.432 --> 01:13:08.276
Where did you get that dress? It's awful!

1070
01:13:08.352 --> 01:13:11.196
And those shoes, and that coat. Jesus!

1071
01:13:15.484 --> 01:13:19.205
8 miles. Turn right to heading 044.

1072
01:13:21.699 --> 01:13:24.794
<i>We're now at 2,000 feet,
beginning our descent.</i>

1073
01:13:24.868 --> 01:13:25.994
Steve.

1074
01:13:26.078 --> 01:13:28.001
I want every light you can get
poured onto that field.

1075
01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:29.332
Being done right now.

1076
01:13:34.169 --> 01:13:36.968
Tower to all emergency vehicles.
Runway is niner.

1077
01:13:38.048 --> 01:13:40.972
<i>Airport vehicles
take positions one and two.</i>

1078
01:13:41.301 --> 01:13:43.349
Civilian equipment, number three.

1079
01:13:45.305 --> 01:13:47.933
<i>Air Force, positions
number four and five.</i>

1080
01:13:48.016 --> 01:13:50.519
<i>All ambulances, go to number three.</i>

1081
01:13:50.644 --> 01:13:53.864
<i>Air Israel,
please clear the runway.</i>

1082
01:13:59.570 --> 01:14:02.824
In a moment, we'll ask you
to assume crash positions.

1083
01:14:02.906 --> 01:14:05.159
Your life jackets
are located under your seat.

1084
01:14:05.826 --> 01:14:07.624
Place the jacket over your head,

1085
01:14:07.703 --> 01:14:11.674
and when I give the word,
pull the cord on the right-side flap.

1086
01:14:12.583 --> 01:14:15.052
- Isn't that cute?
- Your seat cushions are also equipped

1087
01:14:15.127 --> 01:14:16.674
with a floatation device.

1088
01:14:17.463 --> 01:14:21.593
<i>WZAZ in Chicago,
where disco lives forever.</i>

1089
01:14:25.721 --> 01:14:28.099
Watch your altitude, Striker.
You're too erratic.

1090
01:14:28.182 --> 01:14:30.105
You can't come straight in.

1091
01:14:30.184 --> 01:14:32.312
You've got enough fuel left
for two hours of flying.

1092
01:14:32.603 --> 01:14:34.321
I'll take it, Elaine.

1093
01:14:34.396 --> 01:14:36.069
Listen to me, Kramer.

1094
01:14:36.148 --> 01:14:40.119
We have people up here who will die
in less than an hour, let alone two.

1095
01:14:40.194 --> 01:14:42.868
I may bend your precious airplane,
but I'll get it down.

1096
01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:45.248
I'm putting the landing gear down now.

1097
01:14:45.324 --> 01:14:48.123
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.

1098
01:14:48.202 --> 01:14:49.579
Thanks, Randy.

1099
01:14:49.661 --> 01:14:52.881
You better leave, sweetheart.
You might get hurt up here.

1100
01:15:02.549 --> 01:15:03.675
Ted?

1101
01:15:05.010 --> 01:15:06.057
Yes?

1102
01:15:06.804 --> 01:15:09.398
I wanted you to know, now,

1103
01:15:10.349 --> 01:15:11.976
I'm very proud.

1104
01:15:16.438 --> 01:15:19.237
Tell them the gear is down,
and we're ready to land.

1105
01:15:23.028 --> 01:15:25.827
The gear is down,
and we're ready to land.

1106
01:15:27.533 --> 01:15:29.206
All right, he's on final now.

1107
01:15:29.284 --> 01:15:32.003
Put out all runway lights, except niner.

1108
01:15:33.664 --> 01:15:37.259
Captain, maybe we ought
to turn on the searchlights now.

1109
01:15:38.293 --> 01:15:39.340
No.

1110
01:15:40.254 --> 01:15:43.349
That's just what
they'll be expecting us to do.

1111
01:15:49.054 --> 01:15:51.477
I just wanna tell you both, good luck.
We're all counting on you.

1112
01:15:54.768 --> 01:15:56.987
All right, now just listen carefully.

1113
01:15:57.062 --> 01:15:59.281
You should be able to see the runway
at 300 feet.

1114
01:15:59.773 --> 01:16:01.867
Aim the touch down
a third of the way along.

1115
01:16:01.942 --> 01:16:05.367
There's a slight crosswind
from the right, so be ready for it.

1116
01:16:05.445 --> 01:16:07.948
Land too fast,
use your emergency brakes.

1117
01:16:08.031 --> 01:16:10.079
Red handle's right in front of you.

1118
01:16:10.158 --> 01:16:12.286
If that doesn't stop you...

1119
01:16:17.666 --> 01:16:19.964
If that doesn't stop you,
cut the four ignition switches

1120
01:16:20.043 --> 01:16:21.465
over the copilot's head.

1121
01:16:25.132 --> 01:16:26.884
<i>Do you see us now?</i>

1122
01:16:26.967 --> 01:16:29.561
<i>You should be able to see the field, now.</i>

1123
01:16:36.393 --> 01:16:39.613
- Sure is quiet out there.
- Yeah, too quiet.

1124
01:16:41.982 --> 01:16:45.577
Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit sniffing glue.

1125
01:16:58.165 --> 01:16:59.542
There it is.

1126
01:17:02.002 --> 01:17:03.049
There he is!

1127
01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:07.508
Striker, you're coming in too fast!

1128
01:17:07.925 --> 01:17:09.472
I know! I know!

1129
01:17:09.551 --> 01:17:11.224
He knows! He knows!

1130
01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:13.312
Wow.

1131
01:17:14.473 --> 01:17:16.521
He's below 700 now, still going down.

1132
01:17:16.683 --> 01:17:20.108
675, 650, 625. He's holding.

1133
01:17:20.187 --> 01:17:22.485
He's holding. He's at...
No, no. He's down, he's down.

1134
01:17:22.564 --> 01:17:24.692
Sound your alarm bell, now!

1135
01:17:26.610 --> 01:17:29.204
All right, now, everybody,
get in crash positions.

1136
01:17:34.743 --> 01:17:36.586
Put down 30 degrees of flap!

1137
01:17:40.415 --> 01:17:41.632
Striker, now listen to me.

1138
01:17:41.708 --> 01:17:43.335
Remember your brakes and switches!

1139
01:17:43.418 --> 01:17:45.091
Get ready to flare it out!

1140
01:17:46.088 --> 01:17:47.465
He's all over the place.

1141
01:17:47.547 --> 01:17:50.016
900 feet up to 1300 feet.

1142
01:17:50.092 --> 01:17:51.514
What an asshole.

1143
01:17:51.593 --> 01:17:54.346
<i>Hold up, harder!
Put down more flap!</i>

1144
01:17:59.726 --> 01:18:01.194
Just kidding.

1145
01:18:02.646 --> 01:18:05.775
<i>Striker, lift your nose.
Straighten your wings!</i>

1146
01:18:06.108 --> 01:18:08.987
Coming in too fast. Watch your speed.

1147
01:18:09.069 --> 01:18:11.037
He's coming right at us!

1148
01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:16.543
Coming in too hot!

1149
01:18:17.202 --> 01:18:18.829
<i>Ease up on the throttle!</i>

1150
01:18:18.912 --> 01:18:21.210
<i>Watch for that crosswind. Level it out.</i>

1151
01:18:21.289 --> 01:18:23.792
<i>Aim for the numbers.
You'll have to dip your left wing.</i>

1152
01:18:27.879 --> 01:18:30.974
<i>You're drifting. Keep your eyes
on the far end of the runway.</i>

1153
01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:35.183
<i>You're too low, damn it!</i>

1154
01:18:36.888 --> 01:18:38.765
<i>Watch your stall speed.</i>

1155
01:18:42.185 --> 01:18:43.607
<i>Flare out!</i>

1156
01:18:46.106 --> 01:18:48.029
Now ease her down! Down!

1157
01:18:52.696 --> 01:18:54.994
<i>The brake! Pull the red handle!</i>

1158
01:19:00.287 --> 01:19:04.292
I just wanna tell you both, good luck.
We're all counting on you.

1159
01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:13.975
<i>Flight 209 now arriving,
Gate 8.</i>

1160
01:19:15.010 --> 01:19:16.307
<i>Gate 9.</i>

1161
01:19:17.137 --> 01:19:18.389
<i>Gate 10.</i>

1162
01:19:19.139 --> 01:19:21.392
<i>Pull on a lever. Push a button!</i>

1163
01:19:28.398 --> 01:19:29.945
<i>Gate 13.</i>

1164
01:19:30.025 --> 01:19:31.652
<i>Gate 14.</i>

1165
01:19:31.735 --> 01:19:33.112
<i>Gate 15.</i>

1166
01:19:42.829 --> 01:19:46.208
Auntie Em, Uncle Henry, Toto!
It's a twister! It's a twister!

1167
01:19:48.668 --> 01:19:49.965
<i>Gate 23.</i>

1168
01:19:50.045 --> 01:19:51.046
<i>24.</i>

1169
01:19:51.129 --> 01:19:52.346
<i>25.</i>

1170
01:20:15.403 --> 01:20:19.408
I just wanna tell you both, good luck.
We're all counting on you.

1171
01:20:24.871 --> 01:20:26.418
<i>Striker?</i>

1172
01:20:26.498 --> 01:20:28.842
<i>- Striker, you all right?
- Yeah.</i>

1173
01:20:29.793 --> 01:20:30.919
We're okay.

1174
01:20:31.378 --> 01:20:33.847
Ted, that was probably
the lousiest landing

1175
01:20:33.922 --> 01:20:36.266
in the history of this airport.

1176
01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.973
But some of us here, particularly me,

1177
01:20:39.845 --> 01:20:43.065
<i>would like to buy you a drink
and shake your hand.</i>

1178
01:20:48.019 --> 01:20:51.239
<i>And, Ted, I just want you to know
that when the going got rough...</i>

1179
01:20:53.233 --> 01:20:55.702
Okay, all right. Have a nice day.

1180
01:20:55.777 --> 01:20:57.529
Okay. Have a nice day.

1181
01:20:57.612 --> 01:20:59.614
Thank you for flying Trans American.

1182
01:21:00.490 --> 01:21:02.993
<i>Loneliness, that's the bottom line.</i>

1183
01:21:03.743 --> 01:21:05.666
<i>I was never happy as a child.</i>

1184
01:21:05.745 --> 01:21:07.713
<i>Christmas, Ted,
what does that mean to you?</i>

1185
01:21:07.789 --> 01:21:09.382
<i>To me, it was a living hell.</i>

1186
01:21:10.167 --> 01:21:12.716
Do you know what it's like
to fall in the mud and get kicked,

1187
01:21:12.794 --> 01:21:15.138
in the head, by an iron boot?

1188
01:21:16.506 --> 01:21:19.009
Of course you don't.
No one does. That never happens.

1189
01:21:19.092 --> 01:21:21.265
I'm sorry, Ted.
That's a dumb question. Skip that.

1190
01:21:22.679 --> 01:21:24.602
Hurry, hurry.

1191
01:21:26.099 --> 01:21:27.772
Okay, folks. There you go.

1192
01:21:27.851 --> 01:21:29.444
Have a nice day.

1193
01:21:44.159 --> 01:21:47.459
Municipal bonds, Ted.
I'm talking double-A rating.

1194
01:21:47.537 --> 01:21:48.914
The best investment in America.

1195
01:27:21.663 --> 01:27:24.212
Well, I'll give him another 20 minutes.

1196
01:27:24.290 --> 01:27:25.587
But that's it.
