00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:27.421
The white zone is for loading
and unloading of passengers only.

2
00:01:27.505 --> 00:01:30.065
There is no stopping in the red zone.

3
00:01:31.345 --> 00:01:36.294
The white zone is for loading
and unloading of passengers only.

4
00:01:36.385 --> 00:01:39.183
There is no stopping in the red zone.

5
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.069
The white zone is for loading
and unloading of passengers only.

6
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.958
There is no stopping in the red zone.

7
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.388
Hello. Take this flower from
the Religious Consciousness Church.

8
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.234
- Would you care to make a donation?
- No, but thank you anyway.

9
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.316
The red zone is for loading
and unloading of passengers only.

10
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.358
There's no stopping
in the white zone.

11
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.716
No. The white zone
is for loading and unloading.

12
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.678
There's no stopping in the red zone.

13
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.514
The red zone's always been
for loading and unloading.

14
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.034
There's never stopping
in a white zone.

15
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.795
Don't tell me which zone's for
stopping and which is for loading.

16
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.475
Listen, Betty, don't start up
with your white zone shit again.

17
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.909
Hello. Take this flower from
the Religious Consciousness Church.

18
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.672
Would you like to make a donation?

19
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.194
No, thanks. We gave at the office.

20
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.234
Would you put all your metal objects
into this dish, please?

21
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.713
There's just no stopping
in a white zone.

22
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.677
Really, Vernon, why pretend?

23
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.513
We both know
what you're talking about.

24
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.477
You want me to have an abortion.

25
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.950
It's the only sensible thing to do.
If it's done properly,

26
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.998
therapeutically,
there's no danger involved.

27
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.354
Taxi!

28
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.317
I'll be back in a minute.

29
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.919
Hello, sir, take this flower from
the Religious Consciousness Church.

30
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.558
Would you care...

31
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.473
- Hey, Larry, where's the forklift?
- Forklift?

32
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.154
It's over there
by the baggage loader.

33
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.758
Look out!

34
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.314
- Elaine.
- Ted!

35
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.914
I came home early
and found your note.

36
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.788
I guess you meant for me to read
it later. I've got to talk to you.

37
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.235
I don't want to go over it any more.

38
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.788
Things haven't been right
for a long time,

39
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.952
but it'll be different,
like in the beginning.

40
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.996
Just be patient
and I'll work things out.

41
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.072
I have been patient
and I've tried to help,

42
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.116
but you wouldn't even let me do that.

43
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.193
Don't you feel anything
for me any more?

44
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.478
It takes so many things
to make love last.

45
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.596
Most of all, it takes respect.

46
00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.719
I can't live with a man
I don't respect!

47
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.111
What a pisser.

48
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.313
Captain Oveur, white courtesy phone.

49
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.437
Captain Clarence Oveur,
white courtesy phone.

50
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.076
No, the white phone!

51
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.158
This is Captain Oveur.

52
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.232
One moment for your call
from the Mayo Clinic.

53
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.118
Captain Oveur, white courtesy phone.

54
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.316
- I've got it!
- Thank you.

55
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.277
Go ahead with your call.

56
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.351
This is Dr Brody at the Mayo Clinic.

57
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.908
There's a passenger
on your Chicago flight,

58
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.958
a little girl named Lisa Davis,
en route to Minneapolis.

59
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.349
She's scheduled
for a heart transplant.

60
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.635
Tell her mother we found a donor.

61
00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.711
The heart is ready for surgery.

62
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.156
We must have the recipient on
the operating table within six hours.

63
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.550
Make sure she's kept
in a reclined position,

64
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.518
that a continuous watch
is kept on her IV.

65
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.830
It's very important
she remain calm...

66
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.751
Excuse me, this is the operator.

67
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.799
I have an emergency call
on line five from Mr Hamm.

68
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.916
Give me Hamm on five, hold the Mayo.

69
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.676
You'll be back tomorrow night.

70
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.716
We'll have dinner.
We'll talk things over.

71
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.156
I won't be back.
I've requested the Atlanta run.

72
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.038
Elaine... I promise I can change.

73
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.874
Then why didn't you take the job that
Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?

74
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.589
I haven't been able to get near
a plane since the war.

75
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.195
And they wouldn't hire me
because of my war record.

76
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.795
War record? You're the only one
keeping that alive.

77
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.030
For everyone else,
it's ancient history.

78
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.430
- You expect me to believe that?
- It's the truth.

79
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.478
What's hurt you the most
is your record since the war -

80
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.993
different cities, different jobs -

81
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.390
and not one of them shows you
can accept any real responsibility.

82
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.392
- Elaine, just give me one more...
- It's too late, Ted.

83
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.869
When I get back to Chicago,

84
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.078
I'm going to start my life
all over again. I'm sorry.

85
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.677
Excuse me, take this flower
from the Church of Religious...

86
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.316
Hi! Well, good evening.

87
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.154
There you go.
Just follow them to the back.

88
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.752
Any word on that storm lifting
over Salt Lake, Clarence?

89
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.274
No, not likely, Victor.

90
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.239
I just reviewed the area report
for 1600 hours through 2400.

91
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.198
There's an occluded front
stalled over the Dakotas,

92
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.077
backed up all the way to Utah.

93
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.914
If she decides to push over the Great
Lakes, it could get plenty soupy.

94
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.877
What about that southern route
around Tulsa?

95
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.315
I double-checked
the terminal forecast,

96
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.517
and the wind's aloft
and IFR ceilings all the way.

97
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.352
Where do they top out?

98
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.194
Light scattered cover
at 20,000, icing around 18.

99
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.193
- Looks like over Denver is best.
- Denver it is.

100
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.918
Sorry, Clarence.

101
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.151
Latest report shows everything's
socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.

102
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.912
Hi, Roger. Glad to have you aboard.

103
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.718
Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Victor Basta.

104
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.950
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

105
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.112
I was telling Victor
I reviewed the area report

106
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.351
for 1600 hours through 2400.

107
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.557
There's an occluded front
stalled over the Dakotas.

108
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.120
There you go. Thank you.

109
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.998
Is Elaine Dickinson on this flight?

110
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.710
The whole flight crew has boarded.
Let me see.

111
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.552
Oh, yes. She is on board.

112
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.195
I'd like one ticket to Chicago.
No baggage.

113
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.116
- Smoking or non-smoking?
- Smoking, please.

114
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.150
There. Have a nice trip.

115
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.399
Striker, this is Red Leader Four.

116
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.550
Primary target covered by fog.

117
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.631
Decision to proceed is yours.

118
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.917
The decision is yours...

119
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.673
is yours... is yours...

120
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.634
Golly, that white fellow
should stay away from my wife,

121
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.234
or I will punch him.

122
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.632
Yes, he is wrong for doing that.

123
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.234
I knew a man
in a similar predicament,

124
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.753
and he ended up being sorry.

125
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.990
Don't be naive, Arthur.

126
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.152
Each of us faces
a clear moral choice.

127
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.436
Early to bed, early to rise makes
a man healthy, wealthy and wise.

128
00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.078
How true!

129
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.115
Golly!

130
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.392
Nervous?

131
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.277
Yes.

132
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.920
First time?

133
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.878
No. I've been nervous lots of times.

134
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.434
Hi. We'll be taking off real soon,
so I better fasten you in tight.

135
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.398
Thank you.
Oh, Mother, this is so exciting!

136
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.278
I know, but remember,
you must get some rest.

137
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.273
That's good advice. You relax,
and I'll be back after takeoff.

138
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.679
Thank you.

139
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.156
- I'm going to miss you so much.
- I'm going to miss you, too.

140
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.038
Promise you'll write?

141
00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.156
Every day.

142
00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.873
Bill!

143
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.076
Better get on board, son.

144
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.796
All aboard!

145
00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.031
209er to ground control.
We're ready to taxi.

146
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.839
- Goodbye, Bill!
- Goodbye, darling!

147
00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.717
I love you, darling!

148
00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.234
209er, taxi to runway 19er.

149
00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.352
Goodbye, darling!

150
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.910
Have your picture taken the minute
you get there and send me one.

151
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.036
OK. Here, hurry.

152
00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.312
It's your watch. You shouldn't.
You're going to need this.

153
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.595
It's all right. It doesn't work.

154
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.511
- Bill!
- Goodbye, darling!

155
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.874
Bill!

156
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.550
Bill! Bill!
I'll keep it with me all the time.

157
00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.949
Goodbye, darling.
Take care of yourself. Goodbye.

158
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.269
- Flight 209er - clear for takeoff.
- Roger.

159
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.238
- LA departure frequency 123.9er.
- Roger.

160
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.149
- Request vector. Over.
- What?

161
00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.435
Flight 209er, clear for vector 324.

162
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.715
- We have clearance, Clarence.
- Roger, Roger.

163
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.597
What's our vector, Victor?

164
00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.514
- I want radio clearance. Over.
- That's Clarence Oveur. Over.

165
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.318
- Roger.
- Huh?

166
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.153
- Roger. Over.
- Huh? Who?

167
00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.910
Do you feel all right, sir?

168
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.436
Oh, I haven't flown for a long time.

169
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.910
Good evening.
This is Captain Oveur speaking.

170
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.072
We'll be cruising
at 36,000 feet this evening...

171
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.716
Relax and enjoy your flight.

172
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.836
Would you like something to read?

173
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.911
Do you have anything light?

174
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.633
How about this leaflet,
"Famous Jewish Sports Legends"?

175
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.597
Yes. Thank you.

176
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.037
- Ted! What are you doing here?
- I've got to talk to you.

177
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.588
You shouldn't have come.
I don't have time now.

178
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.636
- Stewardess?
- Excuse me.

179
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.709
But...

180
00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:46.753
No wonder you're upset. She's lovely.

181
00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.439
And a darling figure.

182
00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.991
Supple, pouting breasts, firm thighs.

183
00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.238
It's a shame you two
don't get along.

184
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.276
Yes, I know.

185
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.316
Things used to be different.

186
00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.954
I remember when we first met.

187
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.918
It was during the war.

188
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.752
I was in the air force,

189
00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:18.355
stationed in Drambuie,
off the Barbary Coast.

190
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.795
I used to hang out
at the Magumba Bar.

191
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.589
It was a rough place.
The seediest dive on the wharf,

192
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:29.435
populated with every reject and
cut-throat from Bombay to Calcutta.

193
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.397
It was worse than Detroit.

194
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.831
The mood in the place was ugly.

195
00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.356
You wouldn't be there unless
you knew how to use your fists.

196
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.954
A fight broke out almost every night.

197
00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.509
I didn't go there that night
to fall in love.

198
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.556
I just wanted a couple of drinks.

199
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.551
And suddenly, there she was.

200
00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.753
I was captivated, entranced.
It hit me like a thunderbolt.

201
00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:21.197
I had to asked this guy to pinch me
to make sure I wasn't dreaming.

202
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.796
I was afraid to approach her,

203
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.519
but that night, fate was on my side.

204
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.916
We laughed, we talked, we danced.

205
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.595
I never wanted it to end.
I guess I still don't.

206
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.639
Enough about me. I hope
this hasn't been boring for you.

207
00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.473
Whenever I talk about Elaine,
I get carried away.

208
00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.437
I lose all track of time.

209
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.636
Would you like to order dinner?

210
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.518
Joey will have steak.
We'll have fish.

211
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.477
When can I see the cockpit?

212
00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.314
The pilots are probably too busy
flying the plane for that.

213
00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.958
Aw, gee whizz!

214
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.396
I'll talk to the captain
and see what I can arrange.

215
00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.630
Gee, that'd be swell!

216
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.116
Would you care to order your dinners?

217
00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.590
I would like the steak, please.

218
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.189
I'll have the fish.

219
00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.438
Excuse me, I happened to be passing.

220
00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.909
I thought you might like some coffee.

221
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.594
That's very nice of you. Thank you.

222
00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.752
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

223
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.834
- Cream?
- No, I take it black.

224
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.717
Like my men.

225
00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:57.236
Ted, I never knew
I could be so happy.

226
00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.517
These past few months
have been wonderful.

227
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:05.276
Tomorrow, why don't we drive
to that little seafood place and...

228
00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.353
- What's the matter?
- My orders came through.

229
00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.317
My squadron ships out tomorrow.

230
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.756
We're bombing the storage depots
at Daiquiri at 1800 hours.

231
00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.195
We're coming in
from the north, below their radar.

232
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.032
When will you be back?

233
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.317
I can't tell you that.
It's classified.

234
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.916
Oh, Ted, please be careful.
I worry about you so much.

235
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.389
I love you, Elaine.

236
00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.471
I love you.

237
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.909
Flight 209er,
this is Denver flight control.

238
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.991
You're approaching rough weather.

239
00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.435
Please climb to 42,000 feet.

240
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.437
- Roger, Denver.
- We have a visitor.

241
00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.509
Hello.

242
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.752
Captain Oveur, Mr Murdock,
and Mr Basta, this is Joey Hammen.

243
00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.910
- Hi, Joey.
- Come up here.

244
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.879
This is for special visitors.
Would you like to have it?

245
00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:20.317
- Thank you. Thanks a lot.
- Sure. Ever been in a cockpit?

246
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.198
No, I've never been up
in a plane before.

247
00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.919
Have you ever seen a grown man naked?

248
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.993
- Shall I check the weather?
- No, why don't you take care of it?

249
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.868
Joey, do you ever hang around
a gymnasium?

250
00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.316
- We'd better get back.
- No, Joey can stay for a while.

251
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.153
- Could I?
- OK, if you don't get in the way.

252
00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.949
Flight 209er to Denver,
climbing to cruise at 42,000.

253
00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.191
Will report again over Lincoln.
Over and out.

254
00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:51.068
Wait a minute, I know you.
You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar.

255
00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.152
You play basketball
for the Los Angeles Lakers.

256
00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.596
Sorry, you have me confused
with someone else.

257
00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.831
My name's Roger Murdock.
I'm the co-pilot.

258
00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:04.629
You are Kareem! I've seen you play.
My dad's got season tickets.

259
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.837
You should go back to your seat now.
Right, Clarence?

260
00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.872
No, he's not bothering anyone.
Let him stay here.

261
00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.828
All right, but just remember
my name is Roger Murdock.

262
00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.592
I'm an airline pilot.

263
00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.636
I think you're the greatest,

264
00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.998
but my dad says you don't work hard
enough on defence.

265
00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.675
And he says lots of times
you don't even run downcourt.

266
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.877
And you don't try,
except during play-offs.

267
00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.757
The hell I don't!

268
00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.108
Listen, kid, I've been hearing
that crap ever since I was at UCLA.

269
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.556
I'm out there busting my buns
every night.

270
00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.438
Tell your old man
to drag Walton and Lanier

271
00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.750
up and down the court for 48 minutes.

272
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.833
Joey...

273
00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.956
Do you like movies about gladiators?

274
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.073
Elaine, just hear me out.

275
00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.720
Things haven't been right
for a long time,

276
00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.839
but it'll be different,
like in the beginning, remember?

277
00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.878
I remember everything.

278
00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.633
All I have is memories.

279
00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.792
Mostly, I remember the nights
we were together.

280
00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.156
I remember how you used to hold me,

281
00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.471
and how I used to sit on your face
and wriggle, and...

282
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.189
afterwards, how we'd watch
till the sun came up.

283
00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.477
When it did, it was almost like...

284
00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:38.838
like each new day was
created only for us.

285
00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.559
That's the way
I've always wanted it to be.

286
00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.631
But it won't be.

287
00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:47.474
Not as long as you insist
on living in the past!

288
00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.710
You're too low, Ted! You're too low!

289
00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.352
The mind plays tricks on you.

290
00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.391
He looks so happy today, doesn't he?

291
00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.436
You look so happy today.

292
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:23.878
OK, Robert, slip them down.
This won't hurt much.

293
00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.520
You got a telegram
from headquarters today.

294
00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.636
Headquarters? What is it?

295
00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.156
A big building where generals meet,
but that's not important.

296
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.949
They've cleared you of any blame
for what happened on that raid.

297
00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.713
- Isn't that good news?
- Is it?

298
00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:43.510
Because of my mistake,
six men didn't return from that raid.

299
00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.558
Seven.
Lieutenant Zip died this morning.

300
00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:50.349
But Dr Sandler says you'll be out
in a week. Isn't that wonderful?

301
00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.313
I wish I could say the same
for George Zip.

302
00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:59.155
Be patient, Ted. Nobody expects you
to get over this immediately.

303
00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.994
Hey, Striker, how about a break?
I'm getting tired.

304
00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.116
Yeah, all right. Take five.

305
00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.191
Thanks.

306
00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.795
I found a wonderful apartment for us.

307
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.836
It has a brick fireplace

308
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.151
and a cute bedroom
with mirrors on the ceiling and...

309
00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:20.073
Red Leader!
Red Leader, I'm going down!

310
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:24.597
Captain Geline. He think he's
a pilot, still fighting the war.

311
00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.479
I've found the tunnel, Johnson!
It's this way!

312
00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.313
$25 for a cigarette is too much!

313
00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.916
- What's his problem?
- It's Lieutenant Hurwitz.

314
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.036
Severe shell shock.

315
00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.156
He thinks he's Ethel Merman.

316
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.235
War is hell.

317
00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:10.558
Excuse me, sir. Would you
like coffee before dinner?

318
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.870
No. No, thank you.

319
00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.189
- Would you like another cup?
- I will, but Jim won't.

320
00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:22.432
I think I will have
another cup of coffee.

321
00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.671
Jim never has a second
cup of coffee at home.

322
00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.034
- Excuse me, sister.
- Yes?

323
00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.475
There's a little girl
onboard who's ill.

324
00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.233
Oh, yes, I saw. Poor child.

325
00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:43.199
Could I borrow your guitar?
I thought maybe I could cheer her up.

326
00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.669
- Of course.
- Thank you.

327
00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.917
- Hi.
- Hi.

328
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.719
Do you mind if I talk
to your daughter?

329
00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.268
I think that'd would be nice.

330
00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.519
- Hi, I'm Randy.
- I'm Lisa.

331
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.319
Oh, you have a guitar!

332
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.358
I thought maybe you'd
like to hear a song.

333
00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.953
I'd love to.

334
00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.679
OK. Let's see...

335
00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.751
This is one of my favorites.

336
00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.356
You're late. We've been waiting.

337
00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.590
- Who's first?
- Go ahead, Clarence.

338
00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.636
How's the weather?

339
00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.676
We got some heavy stuff ahead.

340
00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.591
We've got to climb on top.

341
00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:55.353
Yeah, after the war, I wanted
to get as far away as possible,

342
00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.149
so Elaine and I
joined the Peace Corps.

343
00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:03.677
We were assigned
to an isolated tribe, the Molombos.

344
00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.558
They'd never seen Americans before.

345
00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:21.836
It was really a challenge,

346
00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.992
introducing them
to our western culture.

347
00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.679
At first, they didn't know
what to think of us.

348
00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.830
But soon, we gained their trust.

349
00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.596
It'll help you better
prepare storing foods

350
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.831
for the up and coming
monsoon months.

351
00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.630
Also, Supperware products
are ideal for storing leftovers

352
00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.393
to help stretch your food dollar.

353
00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:00.189
This two-quart
"Seals-M-Rite" container

354
00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.874
keeps hot dog buns fresh for days.

355
00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.112
These people had been completely
isolated from civilization.

356
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.875
No one had outlined a physical
fitness program for them,

357
00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.757
and they had no athletic equipment.

358
00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.717
I started them
on simple calisthenics,

359
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.438
worked up to rudimentary game skills,

360
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.353
and finally,
advanced competitive theory.

361
00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.591
I was patient,
and they were eager to learn.

362
00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.398
They seemed to enjoy themselves.

363
00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.756
Probably due to advanced
American teaching techniques,

364
00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.638
we bridged the generations
of isolation,

365
00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.280
and communicated successfully
with the Molombos.

366
00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.197
They're getting the hang of it.

367
00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.236
When we re-enlist,
I'll teach them baseball.

368
00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.039
Ted, I don't want to stay here.

369
00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:50.318
It's time to go home
to the plans we made before the war.

370
00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:56.318
A lot of people made plans
before the war. Like George Zip.

371
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:05.950
At that moment, I realised Elaine
had doubts about our relationship.

372
00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:09.999
And that, as much as anything else,
led to my drinking problem.

373
00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:14.959
We did come back to the States.
I tried a number of jobs.

374
00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:18.237
I could go on,
but I'd probably bore you.

375
00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.959
I couldn't blame Elaine.
She wanted a career.

376
00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.399
- I can't stand it.
- What is it?

377
00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.471
- Yes?
- It's my stomach.

378
00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:36.712
I haven't felt this awful
since we saw that Ronald Reagan film.

379
00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.315
I'll see if I can find
some dramamine.

380
00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.233
Captain, a woman passenger
is very sick.

381
00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.799
Airsick?

382
00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:55.759
I think so,
but I've never seen it so acute.

383
00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.753
Find out if a doctor's onboard
as quietly as you can.

384
00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:06.598
Joey, have you ever been
in a Turkish prison?

385
00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.878
I shouldn't have had
that second cup of coffee.

386
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:26.077
Jim never vomits at home.

387
00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:29.072
Sorry to wake you.
I'm looking for a doctor.

388
00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.832
There's nothing to worry about.

389
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.674
Stewardess, I think the man
next to me is a doctor.

390
00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:38.355
Sir, excuse me. Sorry to wake you,
are you a doctor?

391
00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.591
- That's right.
- We have sick passengers.

392
00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:45.309
- Could you come look at them?
- Yes. Yes, of course.

393
00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.909
Let me see your tongue.

394
00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.796
I'll be back in a minute.

395
00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:35.799
Tell the captain to land.
She must go to a hospital.

396
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.871
A hospital! What is it?

397
00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.918
It's a big building with patients,
but that's not important.

398
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.878
- I must speak to the captain.
- Certainly.

399
00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.276
Victor, we're running into heavy...

400
00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.476
Roger, take over!

401
00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.391
- Captain, how soon can you land?
- I can't tell.

402
00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:22.597
- You can tell me. I'm a doctor.
- No, I'm not sure.

403
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:27.196
- Can't you take a guess?
- Not for another two hours.

404
00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.272
You can't take a guess
for another two hours?

405
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.796
No, we can't land.
Fog has closed down everything.

406
00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.950
We've got to get through to Chicago.

407
00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.871
Get him out of there!

408
00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.476
What is it, Doctor? What's going on?

409
00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.949
I'm not sure.
Haven't seen anything like this

410
00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.996
since the Anita Bryant Concert.

411
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:20.596
- What did we have for dinner?
- We had a choice - steak or fish.

412
00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.558
Yes, I remember. I had Lasagna.

413
00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.949
- What did he have?
- He had fish.

414
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:30.079
Doctor, two more are sick.
The other passengers are worried.

415
00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.116
We'll handle the passengers.

416
00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.158
Find out what the sick people
had for dinner.

417
00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.798
This is Captain Oveur speaking.

418
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.919
It's bumpy, but we'll be past it
in a few minutes.

419
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.117
We're now flying over Hoover Dam,

420
00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.590
and later we'll pass south
of the Grand Canyon.

421
00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:50.114
Meanwhile, relax
and enjoy your flight, OK?

422
00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.952
Chicago, this is flight 209er.
We're in trouble.

423
00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.996
We need traffic below us cleared

424
00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.718
and priority landing in Chicago.

425
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.435
Yes?

426
00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:09.269
My husband's very sick.
Can you do something?

427
00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.716
The doctor will be with you
in just a moment.

428
00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.671
Do you know what he had for dinner?

429
00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.876
Yes, we both had fish. Why?

430
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.235
It's nothing to be alarmed about.

431
00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.356
We'll be back to you very quickly.

432
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.073
Doctor, Mr Hammen ate fish,

433
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:33.948
and Randy said there are five
more cases, and they all had fish.

434
00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.998
The co-pilot had fish.
What did the navigator have?

435
00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.672
He had fish.

436
00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.877
All right, now we know
what we're up against.

437
00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:46.750
Those who had fish for dinner
will soon become violently ill.

438
00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.753
- Just how serious is it?
- Extremely serious.

439
00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:54.230
It starts with a slight fever,
dryness of the throat.

440
00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.039
When the virus penetrates,
the victim becomes dizzy,

441
00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:00.271
and begins to experience
an itching rash.

442
00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:03.716
From there, the poison works
on the central nervous system,

443
00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.631
causing severe muscle spasms,

444
00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.597
followed by the inevitable drooling.

445
00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.069
At this point,
the digestive system collapses,

446
00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.833
accompanied
by uncontrollable flatulence.

447
00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:15.195
Until, finally,
the poor bastard is reduced

448
00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.794
to a quivering,
wasted piece of jelly.

449
00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:38.072
Put it on... automatic pilot.

450
00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:42.870
Automatic pilot, automatic pilot...
There it is!

451
00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.839
I'll go back to the passengers.

452
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.514
Come in, 209er. This is Chicago.

453
00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.795
Flight 209er, come in.

454
00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:04.474
This is Elaine Dickinson,
the stewardess.

455
00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.471
Captain Oveur's passed out.

456
00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:09.950
We've lost the co-pilot
and navigator, too. We're in trouble.

457
00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:13.191
Roger. I'm Steve McCroskey,
Chicago air control.

458
00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.909
I'll be back in a moment.
Hold all takeoffs.

459
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.560
When 508 reports,
bring it straight in.

460
00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:23.394
Suspend all meal service
on flights leaving Los Angeles.

461
00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:26.153
Tell all dispatchers
to remain at the post.

462
00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.912
- How about coffee?
- No, thanks.

463
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.231
I want the weather
on every available landing field.

464
00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.958
You understand?

465
00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:36.316
Any place available
to land that plane!

466
00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:40.109
Go to the tower
and get a runway diagram.

467
00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.317
Check down the field
for emergency equipment.

468
00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.552
Chief, we got fog every place
east of the Rockies.

469
00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:51.189
They'll have
to come through to Chicago.

470
00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.352
Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit smoking.

471
00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:58.831
Get the best available man
who won't crack under pressure.

472
00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.309
How about Mr Rogers?

473
00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.270
Get me Rex Kramer.

474
00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:14.469
Next to the throttle
is the air speed gauge.

475
00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.518
What speed does it indicate?

476
00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:22.116
- 520 miles per hour.
- Good. Very good.

477
00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.589
Now, check your altitude.

478
00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:28.070
That's the dial below and right
of the speed indicator.

479
00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.152
35,000 feet.

480
00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:34.038
No, wait. 34,000 feet.

481
00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:37.476
No. It's dropping!
It's dropping fast!

482
00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:40.120
Why is it doing that?

483
00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:46.399
Oh, my God! The automatic pilot,
it's deflating!

484
00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.755
Elaine, don't panic.

485
00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:51.673
On his belt line
there's a hollow tube.

486
00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.194
That's the manual inflation nozzle.

487
00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.714
Pull it out and blow on it.

488
00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.478
What the hell's going on up there?

489
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.633
- Elaine.
- Yes, Doctor?

490
00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:02.716
Elaine, you're a member of this crew.

491
00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:05.268
- Can you face some unpleasant facts?
- No.

492
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:08.875
Unless we hospitalise
those people quickly,

493
00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.758
I can't be sure
of saving their lives.

494
00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:14.798
Is there anyone on board
who can land this plane?

495
00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:16.677
Well...

496
00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.712
No. No one I know of.

497
00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:26.033
You ought to know our chances.
Our lives depend on just one thing -

498
00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:31.069
finding someone to fly this plane
who didn't have fish for dinner.

499
00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:45.914
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your stewardess speaking.

500
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.913
We regret any inconvenience
the sudden cabin movement caused.

501
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.595
This is due to periodic air pockets.

502
00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:57.992
There's no reason to become alarmed.
We hope you enjoy your flight.

503
00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:02.676
By the way, is there anyone
on board who can fly a plane?

504
00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.032
Hello. I'm Paul Carey
from the airline.

505
00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.475
- I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
- Yes. Come in, Paul.

506
00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.596
Rex will be right out.

507
00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.360
Shep, sit. Sit!

508
00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:45.079
I understand there's an emergency.

509
00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:49.438
Something like that. There wasn't
time to tell me very much...

510
00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:53.597
Shep, no!

511
00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.877
I'll bet exciting things
happen all the time down there.

512
00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:59.394
Airline business
does have its moments.

513
00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:01.994
After a while, you get used to it.

514
00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.437
Shep! Come!

515
00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:10.316
He gets so excited
when new people are here.

516
00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:13.358
- Are you a pilot?
- No, I'm in...

517
00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.715
a training program.

518
00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:18.997
It's unbelievable.
It's just unbelievable.

519
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:22.470
How many times have I warned
about food inspection?

520
00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:25.313
You'd think
someone would listen to you.

521
00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:30.110
Well, airport management,
the FAA, and the airlines...

522
00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.395
they're all cheats and liars.

523
00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:35.074
All right. Let's get out of here.

524
00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:46.155
I'm sorry, I was just looking
for someone with flying experience.

525
00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:50.074
When they built those roads,
they didn't think about drainage,

526
00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.948
so we had to take a special jeep
up to the main road.

527
00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:56.031
We were lucky to get a jeep,

528
00:46:56.120 --> 00:47:00.272
since, just the day before,
only one we had broke down.

529
00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.833
It had a bad axle...

530
00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:04.718
Excuse me, sir.
There's a problem in the cockpit.

531
00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:06.631
The cockpit? What is it?

532
00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.917
The little room where the pilot sits.
That's not important.

533
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.592
The first officer is ill,

534
00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:14.717
and the captain needs someone
to help him with the radio.

535
00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.189
Do you know anything about planes?

536
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.113
I flew in the war years ago.

537
00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.351
I wouldn't know anything about it.

538
00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.396
Would you go up, please?

539
00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.272
The stewardess said...

540
00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:49.029
- Both pilots?
- Can you fly this plane and land it?

541
00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:51.395
Surely, you can't be serious.

542
00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:54.119
I am serious,
and don't call me Shirley.

543
00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:58.835
Doctor, I've checked everyone.
Mr Striker's the only one.

544
00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:00.592
What's your flying experience?

545
00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:04.639
I flew single-engine fighters,
but this plane has four engines.

546
00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:07.518
It's an entirely different
kind of flying... altogether.

547
00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:10.717
It's an entirely different
kind of flying.

548
00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.872
I haven't touched
any kind of plane in six years.

549
00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:19.191
Mr Striker,
I know nothing about flying.

550
00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:23.876
You're the only one on this plane
who can possibly fly it.

551
00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.520
You're the only chance we've got.

552
00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:09.553
That's right. That's what I said.
You heard me.

553
00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:11.596
Tell Omaha to acknowledge
and stand by.

554
00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:14.990
Every piece
of emergency equipment available.

555
00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:18.038
Alert rescue units every mile
of the way, from here to the Rockies.

556
00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.111
Chief!

557
00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:23.112
We'll need
a free-landing flight check. Fast.

558
00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.316
- It's your wife.
- I want the kids in bed by nine,

559
00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.550
the dog fed, the yard watered,
the gate locked.

560
00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:30.598
Get a note to the milkman -
"No more cheese."

561
00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:34.551
Where the hell is Kramer?

562
00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:46.513
No, he can't do that.
The risk of a flame-out's too great.

563
00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:49.717
Keep him at 24,000... No, feet.

564
00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:55.394
A passenger is going
to land that plane.

565
00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:58.472
- Is that possible?
- It's a hundred to one shot.

566
00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:05.710
- I know this guy.
- You do? Who is it?

567
00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:08.473
Ted striker.
I flew with him during the war.

568
00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:12.109
It won't make my job easier.

569
00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.317
Ted Striker was a crack
flight leader.

570
00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:20.633
He was one of those men who...
felt too much inside.

571
00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:22.711
Maybe you know that kind.

572
00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:26.395
He went all to pieces
on a particular mission.

573
00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.438
Let's just hope
that doesn't happen tonight.

574
00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:40.633
Let's see... Altitude, 24,000 feet.

575
00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:45.150
Level flight. Speed, 520 knots.

576
00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:47.879
Course Zero Niner Zero.

577
00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:51.669
Trim, mixture.
Wash, soap, rinse, spin.

578
00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:59.198
Ted! What are you doing here?
You can't fly this plane!

579
00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:01.316
That's what I'm trying to tell them.

580
00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:05.632
Elaine. I don't have time to be
gentle, so I'll be very direct.

581
00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.154
Everyone is in a desperate situation.

582
00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:11.471
Mr Striker is the only hope we got.

583
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.596
Those are the flaps.
This is the thrust.

584
00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:22.956
This must turn on the landing lights.

585
00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:39.549
- Mayday! Mayday!
- Mayday? What the hell is that?

586
00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:43.189
May Day's the Russian new year.
We'll have a big parade and serve...

587
00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:55.950
I can't stand it any more.

588
00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:58.793
I've got to get out of here!

589
00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:00.871
Calm down! Get a hold of yourself!

590
00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.918
- Please let me handle this.
- I've got to get out...

591
00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:08.676
Calm down. Get to your seat.
I'll handle it.

592
00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:10.671
Calm down. Get ahold of yourself.

593
00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:12.990
Doctor, you're wanted on the phone.

594
00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.310
Everything will be all right.

595
00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:19.432
- Sister, I can handle this.
- Got to get out of here!

596
00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:26.394
We'd like you to have this flower.

597
00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.798
Excuse me, sir, would you...

598
00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:32.599
Donations for Reverend Moon?

599
00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:34.352
Jews for Jesus?

600
00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:37.671
Read about Jehovah's Witness?

601
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:40.149
How about Buddhism?

602
00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:42.310
Help Jerry's kids?

603
00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:45.358
- Scientology?
- For nuclear power?

604
00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:55.708
Your attention, please.
No-frills passengers now arriving.

605
00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:59.679
Please have your baggage
claim checks ready to show

606
00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.910
upon leaving the terminal.

607
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.912
This guy has no airline experience.

608
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.753
He's a menace
to everything in the air.

609
00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:09.592
Yes, birds, too.

610
00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:13.036
OK, he's a terrible risk,
but what other choice have we got?

611
00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:16.829
That's the whole story, Rex.
Everything we know.

612
00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:18.990
Let's face a few facts.

613
00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.719
I flew with Striker during the war.

614
00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:25.793
He can't afford to worry about those
times when... things weren't so good.

615
00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:29.953
- Right now things aren't so good.
- Let me tell you something.

616
00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:33.077
Striker was a top-notch
squadron leader long ago.

617
00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:37.392
Get on the horn
and talk that guy down.

618
00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:40.438
Let him get the feel
of that airplane,

619
00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:44.798
then you'll have to talk him
right down to the ground.

620
00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:48.913
Very well.
Put Striker on the speaker.

621
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.958
Use my radio.

622
00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:55.350
I took the wrong week
to quit drinking.

623
00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:00.637
You can work them direct
from here, Captain.

624
00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:07.068
Striker? Striker, this is
Captain Rex Kramer speaking.

625
00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:13.793
Yes, Captain Kramer.
Read you loud and clear.

626
00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:20.077
All right.
It's obvious you remember me.

627
00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:24.472
What do you say we forget about
everything, except what we must do?

628
00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:26.835
Let's not kid each other, Kramer.

629
00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:29.878
You know I've never flown
a bucket like this.

630
00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:33.316
- I'll need all the luck there is.
- Stand by, Striker.

631
00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:38.235
Our one hope is to build this man up.
I've got to give him confidence.

632
00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:41.756
Striker, you ever flown
a multi-engine plane?

633
00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:44.673
- No, never.
- Shit! It's a goddamn waste of time.

634
00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.751
There's no way he can land it!

635
00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:49.354
You got to talk him down! You got to!

636
00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:52.750
Route him into Lake Michigan. At
least avoid killing innocent people.

637
00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:55.718
You're the only chance they've got.

638
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.195
All right.

639
00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:03.909
Striker, you listen,
and you listen close.

640
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.195
Flying a plane
is like riding a bicycle.

641
00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:09.829
It's just harder
to put baseball cards in the spokes.

642
00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:11.797
First, get the feel of the plane.

643
00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:16.635
Later, we'll run down
the landing procedure.

644
00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:22.510
All right.
Disengage the automatic pilot.

645
00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:26.718
Make no violent control movements
like you did in the fighter planes.

646
00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:29.758
All right.
I'll unlock the automatic pilot.

647
00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:38.395
The controls will feel very heavy
compared to a fighter.

648
00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:43.238
Don't worry about that.
It's perfectly normal.

649
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.956
Now, one more thing.

650
00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:00.191
Can somebody work the radio
and leave you free for flying?

651
00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:02.077
The stewardess is here with me.

652
00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:05.675
Good. Have her sit
in the co-pilot seat.

653
00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:10.793
Elaine, he wants you
to sit in the co-pilot seat.

654
00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:21.992
What's going on?
We have a right to know the truth.

655
00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:24.036
All right, I'll level with you all.

656
00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:27.157
The most important thing
is that you remain calm.

657
00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.356
There's no reason to panic.

658
00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:32.591
It's true
one of the crew members is ill.

659
00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:34.636
Slightly ill.

660
00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:37.314
The other two pilots are fine.

661
00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.231
They're flying the plane,

662
00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:41.595
free to pursue
a life of religious fulfilment.

663
00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:46.276
The radio is all yours. Keep an eye
on number three engine gauge.

664
00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:48.316
It's running a little hot.

665
00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:54.392
Striker,
first I'd like to say something.

666
00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:58.075
I know things must look
pretty rough up there.

667
00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:00.833
If you do what I tell you
when I tell you,

668
00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:03.559
there's no reason
you should lack confidence

669
00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:07.155
in your chances of coming out
alive and in one piece.

670
00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:09.549
What weather are you in?

671
00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:12.916
- Rain.
- And a little ice.

672
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.638
And a little ice.

673
00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:20.272
- How's it handling?
- Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

674
00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:22.669
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

675
00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:26.036
All right, Striker.
You're doing just fine.

676
00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.958
It's damn good
he doesn't know I hate his guts.

677
00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:33.828
It's damn good
you don't know he hates your guts.

678
00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:42.794
Can I get you something?

679
00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:49.717
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

680
00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:54.277
- Stewardess. I speak jive.
- Good.

681
00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:56.271
He said he's in great pain,

682
00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:59.318
and he wants to know
if you can help him?

683
00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:03.598
Tell him to relax.
I'll be back with some medicine.

684
00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:35.156
Call Captain Oveur's wife
and let her know what's going on.

685
00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:38.391
This weather bulletin
just came off the wire.

686
00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:41.791
What can you make out of this?

687
00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:46.078
This? I can make a hat
or a brooch or pterodactyl...

688
00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:58.030
- Hello?
- Mrs Oveur?

689
00:58:58.120 --> 00:58:59.917
Yes, this is Mrs Oveur.

690
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.389
This is Ed Macias
calling from the airport.

691
00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:04.710
There's trouble
on your husband's flight.

692
00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:06.756
We don't know how serious it is,

693
00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:10.196
but Steve McCroskey thought you'd
want to come over right away.

694
00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:13.033
Yes. I'll be right down.

695
00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:17.916
I've got to go to the airport.

696
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.434
You can let yourself
out the back door.

697
00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:22.476
There's juice in the refrigerator.

698
00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:33.438
Doctor says the sick people
are getting worse.

699
00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:35.397
We're running out of time.

700
00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:38.912
I've got to concentrate.

701
00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:42.791
I've got to concentrate.

702
00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:46.352
Hello?

703
00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:49.358
Echo!

704
00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:54.590
Pinch hitting for Pedro Bourbone,

705
00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:56.636
Manny Mota.

706
01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.789
- How you doing, honey?
- Jack, I'm so hot, I'm burning up.

707
01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:05.871
I'll turn on some air.

708
01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:14.796
- What's going on?
- Close the window!

709
01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.235
Chicago,
the passengers are panicking.

710
01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:19.470
When do we start down?

711
01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:23.553
Not yet. You'll be in radar range
any second now.

712
01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:27.189
They should have been in range
10 minutes ago.

713
01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:31.068
Gunderson, check the radar range.
Anything yet?

714
01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.037
About two more minutes, chief.

715
01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.190
Two minutes?
They could be miles off course.

716
01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.952
Impossible! They're on instruments.

717
01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.390
This is going to be a real sweat.

718
01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.153
Gunderson,
let me know when you get anything.

719
01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.832
Got a cigarette, Nels?

720
01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:54.639
I can't take much more of this.

721
01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:01.273
Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit amphetamines.

722
01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.396
- Johnny, how about some more coffee?
- No, thanks.

723
01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.955
These reporters want a statement.

724
01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:09.715
- How much longer can they hold out?
- 30, 45 minutes.

725
01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.519
- Who's flying the plane?
- A passenger.

726
01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.831
He's an experienced air force pilot.
No cause for alarm.

727
01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:18.036
- Take over.
- What kind of plane?

728
01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.509
It's a big, pretty white plane

729
01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:23.512
with red stripes,
curtains and wheels.

730
01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.556
It looks like a big tylenol.

731
01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.632
OK, boys. Let's get some pictures.

732
01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.318
This bulletin just handed to me.

733
01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.311
Stricken airliner
approaching Chicago...

734
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.594
Shana, they bought their tickets.

735
01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:20.719
They knew what
they were getting into.

736
01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:23.872
I say, let them crash!

737
01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:41.591
- Would you like some whisky, ma'am?
- Certainly not!

738
01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.191
How are the passengers?

739
01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.238
I won't deceive you, Mr Striker.
We're running out of time.

740
01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:01.118
Surely, there's something you can do.

741
01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.509
I'm doing everything I can...

742
01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.636
and stop calling me Shirley.

743
01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:30.948
Randy, are you all right?

744
01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:34.430
Oh, Dr Rumack.

745
01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.953
I'm scared.

746
01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.600
I've never been so scared...

747
01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:42.389
And besides,
I'm 26 and I'm not married.

748
01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.836
We're going to make it.
You've got to believe that.

749
01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:49.037
Dr Rumack, do you have any idea
when we'll be landing?

750
01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:51.076
Pretty soon. How are you bearing up?

751
01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:54.152
To be honest,
I've never been so scared,

752
01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.595
but at least I have a husband.

753
01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:12.795
Stay in formation.
Target's just ahead.

754
01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.077
Target should be clear
if you go in low enough.

755
01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:19.596
You'll have to decide.
You'll have to decide.

756
01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:22.399
You'll have to decide.

757
01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.869
Stay in formation.
Target's just ahead.

758
01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:28.475
Target should be clear
if you go in low enough.

759
01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.552
You'll have to decide.
You'll have to decide.

760
01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.358
You'll have to decide.

761
01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:41.714
Oh, rats! Lost number four.

762
01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:44.155
What happened? What went wrong?

763
01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:47.118
I forgot to check the oil pressure.

764
01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:50.954
When Kramer hears about this,
the shit's going to hit the fan.

765
01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:56.637
I told him to watch that
oil temperature. What's he doing?

766
01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:59.393
Stiker, that plane can't land itself.

767
01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:02.995
Ease off. It's not his fault.
It could happen to any pilot.

768
01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.911
It happened to Barbara Stanwyck.

769
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.515
Can't push him too hard. Might break.
Remember who you're dealing with.

770
01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.716
Nick, Pete, Jerry,
there's a fire in the barn.

771
01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:15.477
He's right.
I can't take the pressure.

772
01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.518
I was crazy to think
I could land this plane.

773
01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.433
- But, Ted, you're the only...
- I don't care.

774
01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.317
I don't have what it takes.

775
01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:26.836
They would be better off with someone
who's never flown before.

776
01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:39.633
Bad news. Fog's getting thicker.

777
01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:43.998
And Leon's getting larger.

778
01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:09.836
I know what you're going to say,
so save your breath.

779
01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:14.233
Well, I don't have a thing to say.

780
01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:17.118
You've done the best you could.

781
01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:19.998
You really have. The best you could.

782
01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:22.958
We can't expect to win them all.

783
01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:29.237
I want to tell you something I've
kept to myself through these years.

784
01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:33.279
I was in the war. Medical corps.

785
01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:38.275
One night, they brought in
a badly wounded pilot from one raid.

786
01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:40.590
He could barely talk.

787
01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:42.716
He looked up at me, he said,

788
01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:47.396
"The odds were against us there,
but we went in anyway.

789
01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:52.349
"I'm glad.
Captain made the right decision."

790
01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:56.235
The pilot's name was George Zip.

791
01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.950
George Zip said that?

792
01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.396
The last thing he said to me,

793
01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:07.109
"Doc," he said, "Sometime...

794
01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.236
"... the crew is up against it.

795
01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.550
"The breaks are beating the boys.

796
01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:16.156
"Tell them to give it all they've got

797
01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:19.277
"and win just one for the Zipper.

798
01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:25.359
"I don't know
where I'll be then," he said...

799
01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:29.035
"but I won't smell too good,
that's for sure."

800
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.798
Excuse me, doc.

801
01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:35.950
I've got a plane to land.

802
01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:45.511
You'd better stay up there a bit.

803
01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.830
When the fog lifts,
we'll bring you in.

804
01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.911
I'll take it, Elaine.

805
01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:01.271
Listen, Dr Rumack says the sick
people are in critical condition.

806
01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:04.352
Every minute counts.
We've got to land now.

807
01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:08.473
Don't be a fool, Striker. You know
what landing like this means.

808
01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:10.437
I'm ordering you to stay up there.

809
01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.431
No dice, Chicago.

810
01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:15.432
I'm giving the orders,
and we're coming in.

811
01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:18.876
I guess the foot's
on the other hand now.

812
01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:23.229
He'll never make it in this soup.

813
01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:26.835
But it's his ship now.
He's in charge.

814
01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:29.514
He's boss, head man, top dog,

815
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.636
big cheese, head honcho...

816
01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:33.517
Captain, look at this.

817
01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:36.239
"Passengers certain to die."

818
01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:38.470
"Airline negligent."

819
01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.313
There's a sale at Penny's!

820
01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.916
I'll need three men in the tower.
You, Neubauer, you, Macias.

821
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.956
Me John. Big tree.

822
01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:53.077
Striker, we're going to the tower.
Good luck.

823
01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.878
They're going to the tower.

824
01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:59.033
The tower! The tower!
Rapunzel! Rapunzel!

825
01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.913
Stewardess, how soon till we land?

826
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.276
It won't be long now.
Try not to worry.

827
01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:23.551
We're all ready, sir.

828
01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.676
Captain McCroskey,
this is Captain Roberts.

829
01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.876
Captain Kramer,
this is Captain Colosimo.

830
01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.757
Captain Hinshaw,
this is Captain Gantz.

831
01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:33.276
Captain Kramer, Captain Gantz.
Captain Hinshaw, Captain Roberts.

832
01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:35.271
Colosimo, you work the relay.

833
01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.476
Roberts, check air traffic.

834
01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:41.758
Get that finger out of your ear.
You don't know where it's been.

835
01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.835
- Steve!
- Got a cigarette, Nels?

836
01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:49.435
Linda, your husband and the others
are alive but unconscious.

837
01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.431
Just like Gerald Ford.

838
01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:55.798
There's a chance we can save them
if Striker lands that plane in time.

839
01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:58.155
That isn't much of a chance.

840
01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:01.994
I don't know. We're doing
everything we can. Now excuse me.

841
01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.997
Where did you get that dress?
It's awful!

842
01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.958
And those shoes and that coat! Geez!

843
01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:18.629
8 miles. Turn right to heading 044.

844
01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:23.518
We're now at 2,000 feet
beginning our descent.

845
01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:28.071
- Pour every light onto that field.
- It's being done.

846
01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:35.551
Tower to emergency vehicles,
runway is niner.

847
01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:39.110
Airport vehicles,
take positions one and two.

848
01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:41.316
Civilian equipment, number three.

849
01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:46.073
Air force, positions four and five.

850
01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.355
All ambulances go to number three.

851
01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:52.319
Air Israel, please clear the runway.

852
01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:00.031
In a moment, we'll ask you
to assume crash positions.

853
01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.315
Life jackets are under your seat.

854
01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.709
Place it over your head.

855
01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:08.190
When I give the word,
pull the cord on the right side flap.

856
01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:13.190
Your seat cushions are also equipped
with a flotation device.

857
01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:18.518
WZAZ in Chicago,
where disco lives forever.

858
01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:26.238
Your altitude's too erratic.
You can't come straight in.

859
01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.515
You've got enough fuel for two hours.

860
01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.637
I'll take it, Elaine.
Listen to me, Kramer.

861
01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:35.759
We have people up here who will die
in less than an hour.

862
01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:40.675
I may bend your precious airplane,
but I'll get it down.

863
01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:44.753
- The passengers are ready.
- Thanks, Randy.

864
01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:48.958
You better leave, sweetheart.
You might get hurt up here.

865
01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:00.636
- Ted...
- Yes?

866
01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:04.838
I wanted you to know... now...

867
01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:07.434
I'm very proud.

868
01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:13.278
Tell them the gear is down
and we're ready to land.

869
01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.758
The gear is down,
and we're ready to land.

870
01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:23.392
He's on final now.

871
01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:26.398
Put out all runway lights
except niner.

872
01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:31.438
Captain, maybe we ought
to turn on the searchlights.

873
01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.238
No.

874
01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:37.279
That's just what they'll
be expecting us to do.

875
01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:45.753
I want to tell you both good luck.
We're all counting on you.

876
01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:49.470
Now listen carefully.

877
01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:51.790
You'll see the runway at 300 feet.

878
01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:54.917
Touch down a third of the way.

879
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.389
A slight cross wind, so be ready.

880
01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.358
Land too fast,
use your emergency brakes.

881
01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:04.115
Red handle's right in front.
If that doesn't stop you...

882
01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:13.069
If that doesn't stop you,
cut the four ignition switches.

883
01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:20.751
Can you see us now? You should
be able to see the field.

884
01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:31.039
- Sure is quiet out there.
- Yeah, too quiet.

885
01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:36.273
Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit sniffing glue.

886
01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:50.112
There it is.

887
01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:52.795
There he is!

888
01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.191
Striker, you're coming in too fast.

889
01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:58.998
I know, I know!

890
01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:00.877
He knows, he knows!

891
01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:05.835
Below 700 now. Still going down.

892
01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:09.595
675, 650, 625, he's holding.

893
01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:11.511
No, he's down, he's down.

894
01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.556
Sound your alarm now.

895
01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:18.034
Now, everybody,
get in crash positions.

896
01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:25.031
Put down 30 degrees of flap.

897
01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:31.832
All right, listen to me.
Remember your brakes and switches.

898
01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:33.638
Get ready to flare it out!

899
01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:35.756
He's all over the place.

900
01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:39.355
900 up to 1,300 feet.
What an asshole.

901
01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:42.079
More left rudder. Put down more flap.

902
01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:48.832
Just kidding!

903
01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:53.111
Striker, lift your nose.
Straighten your wings.

904
01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:56.078
Coming in too fast. Watch your speed.

905
01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.355
He's coming right at us!

906
01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:05.556
Coming in too hot.
Ease up on the throttle.

907
01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:09.349
Watch out for that cross wind.
Level it out.

908
01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.431
You'll have to dip your left wing.

909
01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:17.156
You're drifting. Keep your eyes
on the far end of the runway.

910
01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:21.157
You're too low, damn it!

911
01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.518
Watch your stall speed.

912
01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:29.193
Flare it out!

913
01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:33.717
Ease her down. Down!

914
01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:40.838
The brake! Pull the red handle!

915
01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:49.239
I want to tell you both good luck.
We're all counting on you.

916
01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:59.351
Flight 209 now arriving
at gate eight.

917
01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:01.556
Gate nine.

918
01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:03.039
Gate ten.

919
01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:05.714
Pull out of it! Push that button!

920
01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:15.311
Gate 13... Gate 14.

921
01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:16.913
Gate 15...

922
01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:29.357
Auntie Em! Toto! It's a twister!

923
01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:35.315
Gate 23, 24, 25...

924
01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:02.314
I want to tell you both good luck.
We're all counting on you.

925
01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:07.949
Striker?

926
01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:12.232
- Striker, are you all right?
- Yeah. We're OK.

927
01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:15.278
Ted, that was probably
the lousiest landing

928
01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:17.874
in the history of this airport.

929
01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:19.951
But some of us, particularly me,

930
01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:23.874
would like to buy you a
drink and shake your hand.

931
01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:31.678
And, Ted, when the going got rough...

932
01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.789
Have a nice day. OK.

933
01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:40.111
Have a nice day and thank you
for flying TransAmerican.

934
01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:43.510
Loneliness, that's the bottom line.

935
01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:45.591
I was never happy as a child.

936
01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:47.875
Christmas,
what does that mean to you?

937
01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:50.030
Mine was living hell.

938
01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:53.078
Do you know what it's like
to fall in the mud

939
01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:55.958
and get kicked in the head
by an iron boot?

940
01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:58.235
Of course not. It never happens.

941
01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:00.515
Sorry. That's a dumb question.
Skip that.

942
01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:08.039
There you go. Have a nice day.

943
01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:25.516
Municipal bonds, Ted.
Talking double "A" rating.

944
01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:28.160
Best investment in America.

945
01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:50.039
Well, I'll give him
another 20 minutes, but that's it.

946
01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:53.078
English
