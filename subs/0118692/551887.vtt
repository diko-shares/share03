00:00:27.175 --> 00:00:30.135
<i>Deck the halls with boughs of holly</i>

2
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.100
<i>Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la</i>

3
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:36.101
<i>'Tis the season to be jolly</i>

4
00:00:36.184 --> 00:00:39.190
<i>Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la</i>

5
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.150
<i>Don we now our gay apparel</i>

6
00:00:42.232 --> 00:00:45.162
<i>Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la</i>

7
00:00:45.235 --> 00:00:48.105
<i>Troll the ancient Yuletide carol</i>

8
00:00:48.196 --> 00:00:52.026
<i>Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la</i>

9
00:00:52.117 --> 00:00:54.197
Whoa!

10
00:00:56.371 --> 00:00:59.371
<i>Deck the halls with boughs of holly</i>

11
00:00:59.457 --> 00:01:02.337
Ha-ha. There must be much, much more holly.

12
00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:04.419
<i>'Tis the season to be...</i>

13
00:01:04.504 --> 00:01:05.842
What's this? There's too much holly.

14
00:01:05.922 --> 00:01:08.382
Whoa! Slow down, lad.

15
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:11.426
<i>Don we now our gay apparel</i>

16
00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:14.141
No, no, no, no more mistletoe.

17
00:01:18.768 --> 00:01:21.958
Chip, away from those presents, dear.

18
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:26.071
Mama, I found one for me!

19
00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:28.031
Can I open it, Mama? Can I?

20
00:01:28.111 --> 00:01:31.321
- Well, just one.
- Oh, boy!

21
00:01:31.614 --> 00:01:34.750
It's good to see the boy
having a proper Christmas.

22
00:01:34.826 --> 00:01:36.826
Not like last year.

23
00:01:36.995 --> 00:01:40.325
Yes. This is much more agreeable.

24
00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:43.245
Well, I thought last year was quite nice.

25
00:01:43.334 --> 00:01:47.592
Yes, well, I suppose I...
I did manage to save Christmas.

26
00:01:47.672 --> 00:01:50.052
- You?
- Yes, me.

27
00:01:50.117 --> 00:01:53.507
If not for my skillful
and decisive leadership,

28
00:01:53.595 --> 00:01:54.795
all would've been lost.

29
00:01:54.888 --> 00:01:58.728
Leadership? Ha!
You could not lead a horse to water.

30
00:01:58.808 --> 00:02:02.604
What are you yammering about?
It was all my idea.

31
00:02:02.687 --> 00:02:05.607
Your idea? Everyone knows it was mine.

32
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.110
Heavens. How many times are
we going to have to go over this story?

33
00:02:10.195 --> 00:02:14.525
- Story?
- Until someone gets his facts straight.

34
00:02:14.616 --> 00:02:17.446
- Why don't you tell it, Mama?
- Capital idea.

35
00:02:17.535 --> 00:02:19.655
Well, I don't know.

36
00:02:19.746 --> 00:02:21.286
Come now, Mrs. Potts.

37
00:02:21.372 --> 00:02:24.332
Surely you recall how I saved Christmas.

38
00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:26.585
Tut-tut-tut-tut. No leading the witness.

39
00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:29.129
Please, Mama, tell the story.

40
00:02:29.214 --> 00:02:31.469
Oh, all right.

41
00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.598
Ah! Now we will hear what really happened.

42
00:02:35.678 --> 00:02:37.758
Well, let's see.

43
00:02:37.847 --> 00:02:40.927
Belle, terrified by the master's anger,

44
00:02:41.017 --> 00:02:42.637
ran away from the castle

45
00:02:42.727 --> 00:02:46.307
straight into a pack of wolves.

46
00:02:46.397 --> 00:02:48.977
But the master saved her.

47
00:02:49.067 --> 00:02:51.027
<i>They began to be friends.</i>

48
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.400
<i>Ah-ah-ah.</i>

49
00:02:52.487 --> 00:02:54.907
<i>That's where I came in.</i>

50
00:02:56.407 --> 00:02:59.487
- Where could he be?
- Goodness knows.

51
00:02:59.577 --> 00:03:02.117
We've searched every last corner.

52
00:03:02.205 --> 00:03:05.705
I'm beginning to think
he's not in the castle at all.

53
00:03:07.836 --> 00:03:10.046
<i>Voilà!</i> There he is!

54
00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.919
- Wonderful!
- No time to waste.

55
00:03:13.007 --> 00:03:14.877
We must find a way to get them together.

56
00:03:14.968 --> 00:03:17.798
Let's go! Love will not wait.

57
00:03:17.887 --> 00:03:21.267
You really think she's the one?
Will she break the spell?

58
00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.849
I knew it from the moment
I set eyes on her.

59
00:03:23.935 --> 00:03:28.475
If anyone can reach the master,
Belle can. Such a kind soul.

60
00:03:29.065 --> 00:03:31.415
And her looks don't hurt either.

61
00:03:31.484 --> 00:03:33.284
Wait for me!

62
00:03:41.661 --> 00:03:44.501
- Hi, Belle.
- Oh, hello.

63
00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:47.289
Chip, do you know what day it is?

64
00:03:47.375 --> 00:03:50.915
Well, it's not Tuesday...

65
00:03:51.004 --> 00:03:54.719
No, silly. Today is December 24th.

66
00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.969
- The day before Christmas.
- And what a beautiful day it is.

67
00:03:59.053 --> 00:04:01.851
A wonderful day for a morning stroll.

68
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:05.980
Yes, yes. Nothing starts the day
like a brisk walk around the grounds.

69
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.608
Yeah! Or you could go ice-skating.

70
00:04:08.688 --> 00:04:11.578
- Ha-ha. Wahoo!
- Yes, fresh air, exercise. Ha-ha.

71
00:04:11.665 --> 00:04:13.525
In moderation, of course.

72
00:04:13.794 --> 00:04:17.408
Come along, Belle, dear.
The great outdoors awaits.

73
00:04:17.488 --> 00:04:19.448
Yeah, let's go!

74
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:30.251
Oh. Good morning.

75
00:04:30.335 --> 00:04:32.845
Huh? Whoa...

76
00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:37.509
Oh, dear. Are you all right?

77
00:04:38.301 --> 00:04:40.391
Uh... Uh...

78
00:04:42.138 --> 00:04:47.268
I fell and I landed on my...
On... On the ice.

79
00:04:47.352 --> 00:04:49.352
It's pretty slippery.

80
00:04:49.771 --> 00:04:52.611
Yes, it's slippery.

81
00:04:53.524 --> 00:04:56.034
This is a perfect day for skating.

82
00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:59.071
Come on.

83
00:04:59.697 --> 00:05:00.947
Hmm?

84
00:05:01.866 --> 00:05:03.486
Come on.

85
00:05:03.576 --> 00:05:04.946
No.

86
00:05:06.788 --> 00:05:11.078
- Go on, Master. It might be fun.
- Go for it!

87
00:05:11.167 --> 00:05:13.127
Hmm. Hmm?

88
00:05:15.546 --> 00:05:17.216
- Come on!
- Not so fast.

89
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.880
Ooo-ooo la-la.

90
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:22.891
Come on. Why don't you try it like this?

91
00:05:22.971 --> 00:05:27.731
One, two, three. One, two, three.
See? It's easy.

92
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.150
One, two, three.

93
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.360
One, two, three.

94
00:05:35.566 --> 00:05:36.606
Ho-ho-ho.

95
00:05:36.693 --> 00:05:39.282
Yes, I think this may work.

96
00:06:03.553 --> 00:06:07.183
Bravo! Bravo! Encore!

97
00:06:09.142 --> 00:06:12.022
Fife, you approve?

98
00:06:12.103 --> 00:06:15.063
Oh, Maestro, it's magnificent!

99
00:06:15.148 --> 00:06:18.398
Oh, come along. It's merely an opera

100
00:06:20.695 --> 00:06:24.525
to bring the house down.

101
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.700
Is there a part for a piccolo?

102
00:06:29.787 --> 00:06:31.947
Absolutely.

103
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.510
Solo for Fife in B-flat.

104
00:06:41.591 --> 00:06:45.641
- Ooh. I'd do anything for a solo.
- Yes.

105
00:06:46.637 --> 00:06:50.097
I know. Now, Fifey,

106
00:06:50.183 --> 00:06:52.353
in the midst of my crescendo,

107
00:06:52.435 --> 00:06:56.015
I thought I heard merriment
outside the window.

108
00:06:56.105 --> 00:06:58.565
Have a little look-see, will you?

109
00:07:00.818 --> 00:07:03.738
Wow! Would you look at that?

110
00:07:03.821 --> 00:07:07.531
Well, I think I might.
I'll just pick myself up and...

111
00:07:07.617 --> 00:07:08.617
Oh!

112
00:07:08.701 --> 00:07:11.331
What's this? Heavens, look.

113
00:07:11.412 --> 00:07:14.018
I'm bolted to the wall!

114
00:07:14.098 --> 00:07:15.988
Oh, right.

115
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.420
Um, the master is skating.

116
00:07:20.505 --> 00:07:24.085
Skating? Why on earth
would he do a thing like that?

117
00:07:24.175 --> 00:07:27.255
Probably because that
pretty girl is holding his hand.

118
00:07:27.345 --> 00:07:29.805
- What? Belle?
- Hey.

119
00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:34.139
Maybe if she falls in love with him,
the spell will be broken,

120
00:07:34.227 --> 00:07:36.397
and we'll be human again!

121
00:07:38.356 --> 00:07:40.266
Trust me, Fife.

122
00:07:40.358 --> 00:07:43.858
Humanity is entirely overrated.

123
00:07:43.945 --> 00:07:46.775
Before the enchantment, there was no need

124
00:07:46.864 --> 00:07:50.544
for my particular brand of genius.

125
00:07:51.035 --> 00:07:54.285
But now the master needs my melodies

126
00:07:54.372 --> 00:07:57.132
to feed his tormented soul.

127
00:07:57.708 --> 00:08:00.248
I am his confidant

128
00:08:00.878 --> 00:08:02.878
and his best friend.

129
00:08:03.756 --> 00:08:08.896
And I won't let some peasant girl
ruin it for me!

130
00:08:08.986 --> 00:08:13.136
Fife, see to it that this blossoming love

131
00:08:13.224 --> 00:08:15.524
withers on the vine.

132
00:08:16.061 --> 00:08:18.061
Yes, Maestro Forte.

133
00:08:19.397 --> 00:08:21.517
One, two, three.

134
00:08:21.607 --> 00:08:24.737
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three.

135
00:08:24.819 --> 00:08:26.739
I think I've got it!

136
00:08:32.493 --> 00:08:34.749
Hey, down in front. I wanna see.

137
00:08:34.829 --> 00:08:37.249
Let me see. I wanna see, too!

138
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.170
Quiet. Oh, this is very promising.

139
00:08:44.255 --> 00:08:46.755
Ah, yes, there is something in the air.

140
00:08:47.341 --> 00:08:49.138
Could it be love?

141
00:08:49.218 --> 00:08:51.178
Love? Oh, oh, oh, ooh.

142
00:08:51.262 --> 00:08:52.932
Uh. Oh. Oh.

143
00:08:53.014 --> 00:08:54.644
I've got to stop them.

144
00:08:54.724 --> 00:08:55.734
Oh!

145
00:08:58.102 --> 00:09:00.522
Help!

146
00:09:00.938 --> 00:09:03.608
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

147
00:09:03.858 --> 00:09:06.028
What's that little toot up to?

148
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:07.610
Whoa!

149
00:09:13.326 --> 00:09:15.366
Mmm-mmm.

150
00:09:17.455 --> 00:09:19.235
Stop!

151
00:09:38.226 --> 00:09:41.016
It's a Christmas angel, see?

152
00:09:46.317 --> 00:09:48.357
This is no angel.

153
00:09:48.819 --> 00:09:52.059
It's the shadow of a monster.

154
00:09:59.413 --> 00:10:02.673
Oh, Forte is going to be so proud of me.

155
00:10:06.963 --> 00:10:09.263
I don't know why I bother.

156
00:10:11.008 --> 00:10:13.088
Now he's worse than ever.

157
00:10:13.594 --> 00:10:15.854
Don't lose heart, dearest.

158
00:10:29.986 --> 00:10:32.837
I hate Christmas.

159
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.710
The music helps?

160
00:10:45.793 --> 00:10:50.009
Your music is the only thing
that helps me forget.

161
00:10:50.089 --> 00:10:52.629
Don't worry, old friend.

162
00:10:52.717 --> 00:10:55.007
I'm here for you,

163
00:10:55.094 --> 00:10:57.433
just as I have been,

164
00:10:57.513 --> 00:11:00.223
just as I always will be.

165
00:11:01.892 --> 00:11:03.981
Why is the beast such a grump?

166
00:11:04.061 --> 00:11:06.651
I don't know. He's always like that.

167
00:11:07.398 --> 00:11:09.728
- Even at Christmas?
- Yep.

168
00:11:10.651 --> 00:11:13.321
Belle, what's Christmas?

169
00:11:13.404 --> 00:11:15.824
Oh, Chip, you must know about Christmas.

170
00:11:15.906 --> 00:11:19.326
Stockings in front of the fire? Tree?

171
00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.790
Tinsel? Presents?

172
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:23.911
Presents? Do I get one?

173
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.500
Of course. Everyone gets
a present on Christmas.

174
00:11:27.585 --> 00:11:31.005
- Oh, even the master?
- Yes, even the master.

175
00:11:31.088 --> 00:11:34.338
- What are you gonna get him?
- I don't really know him well enough

176
00:11:34.425 --> 00:11:36.505
to know what he would want.

177
00:11:36.594 --> 00:11:40.810
- What would you want?
- Well, what I love most

178
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.600
in the world are my books, my stories.

179
00:11:44.685 --> 00:11:47.185
Why don't you get the master a story?

180
00:11:47.271 --> 00:11:50.611
You're right, Chip. A story.

181
00:11:52.943 --> 00:11:55.950
<i>When I get to know him</i>

182
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.410
<i>We'll find more things to say</i>

183
00:11:59.492 --> 00:12:02.540
<i>One day I will reach him</i>

184
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.040
<i>There has to be a way</i>

185
00:12:06.123 --> 00:12:09.003
<i>Everyone needs someone</i>

186
00:12:09.085 --> 00:12:12.415
<i>He must need someone, too</i>

187
00:12:12.505 --> 00:12:15.755
<i>When I get to know him better</i>

188
00:12:17.426 --> 00:12:19.386
<i>Here's what I will do</i>

189
00:12:20.554 --> 00:12:23.352
<i>I'll read him stories</i>

190
00:12:23.432 --> 00:12:26.812
<i>From picture books all filled with wonder</i>

191
00:12:26.894 --> 00:12:29.859
<i>Magic worlds where the impossible</i>

192
00:12:29.939 --> 00:12:33.109
<i>Becomes the everyday</i>

193
00:12:33.192 --> 00:12:36.362
<i>We'll find a mountaintop</i>

194
00:12:36.445 --> 00:12:39.565
<i>And some moonbeams to sit under</i>

195
00:12:39.657 --> 00:12:45.867
<i>I'll lead because I know the way</i>

196
00:12:45.955 --> 00:12:49.075
<i>So much to discover</i>

197
00:12:49.166 --> 00:12:52.456
<i>I do it all the time</i>

198
00:12:52.545 --> 00:12:55.585
<i>I could live inside bright pages</i>

199
00:12:55.673 --> 00:12:58.633
<i>Where the words all rhyme</i>

200
00:12:58.717 --> 00:13:01.467
<i>We will slay the dragons</i>

201
00:13:01.554 --> 00:13:04.762
<i>That still follow him around</i>

202
00:13:04.849 --> 00:13:08.269
<i>And he'll smile, yes, he'll smile</i>

203
00:13:08.352 --> 00:13:11.522
<i>As his dreams leave the ground</i>

204
00:13:11.605 --> 00:13:14.475
<i>Stories and stories</i>

205
00:13:14.567 --> 00:13:18.027
<i>About mermaids, kings and sunken treasure</i>

206
00:13:18.112 --> 00:13:21.160
<i>Magic worlds where the impossible</i>

207
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.700
<i>Becomes the everyday</i>

208
00:13:24.785 --> 00:13:27.955
<i>I know a tiny place</i>

209
00:13:28.038 --> 00:13:31.288
<i>Just a dot too small to measure</i>

210
00:13:31.375 --> 00:13:33.335
<i>I'll take him there</i>

211
00:13:33.419 --> 00:13:37.629
<i>I know the way</i>

212
00:13:37.715 --> 00:13:40.885
<i>Stories about heroes</i>

213
00:13:40.968 --> 00:13:44.638
<i>Who overcame their deepest sorrow</i>

214
00:13:44.722 --> 00:13:47.770
<i>They'll put hope into his heart again</i>

215
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:51.270
<i>He'll cherish every day</i>

216
00:13:51.353 --> 00:13:54.652
<i>He'll find a better world</i>

217
00:13:54.732 --> 00:13:58.072
<i>And the strength to face tomorrow</i>

218
00:13:58.152 --> 00:14:04.161
<i>I'm sure that when he knows the way</i>

219
00:14:04.241 --> 00:14:06.451
<i>He'll want</i>

220
00:14:06.535 --> 00:14:12.915
<i>To stay</i>

221
00:14:18.881 --> 00:14:21.841
Do you think the master
will like his gift?

222
00:14:21.926 --> 00:14:23.006
I do.

223
00:14:23.093 --> 00:14:26.123
So does this mean
we're gonna have a Christmas?

224
00:14:26.204 --> 00:14:28.144
Uh-huh. Absolutely.

225
00:14:28.307 --> 00:14:30.477
Absolutely not.

226
00:14:30.559 --> 00:14:32.519
Why not?

227
00:14:32.603 --> 00:14:36.861
Out of the question. Not a chance.
Dream on. An impossibility. Forget it.

228
00:14:38.441 --> 00:14:40.651
Come on!

229
00:14:40.736 --> 00:14:42.146
Suck in that gut.

230
00:14:42.238 --> 00:14:46.448
<i>Mon ami</i>. Get with the spirit. Unwind.

231
00:14:46.534 --> 00:14:49.498
- Oh, dear.
- Come on, love. Have a heart.

232
00:14:49.578 --> 00:14:52.868
Yeah. Come on.

233
00:14:52.957 --> 00:14:57.287
- No, no, and... Let me think...
- Uh-huh? Uh-huh?

234
00:14:57.378 --> 00:14:58.958
No!

235
00:14:59.046 --> 00:15:01.836
This is where I put my foot down.

236
00:15:02.216 --> 00:15:04.336
Wait. Get out of...

237
00:15:04.802 --> 00:15:08.262
The master has forbidden Christmas!

238
00:15:08.347 --> 00:15:09.717
Oh, dear.

239
00:15:09.807 --> 00:15:11.557
Forbid Christmas?

240
00:15:11.642 --> 00:15:13.892
No one can forbid Christmas.

241
00:15:13.978 --> 00:15:16.148
He doesn't wish
to be reminded of his past,

242
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:19.820
and Christmas is
a most painful reminder of it.

243
00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.740
I, for one, do not wish to torture him.

244
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.070
I, for one, think a little Christmas
cheer would do him some good.

245
00:15:26.156 --> 00:15:27.776
- Yeah.
- Oh? Hmm.

246
00:15:28.325 --> 00:15:32.245
The girl is right.
It is up to us to do something.

247
00:15:32.329 --> 00:15:35.499
Gosh! It's not our place to get involved.

248
00:15:35.583 --> 00:15:39.590
No, no, no, no! We just can't
mind our own beeswax, can we?

249
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:43.550
Just have to stick our wick
where it doesn't belong.

250
00:15:55.728 --> 00:15:58.898
- Oh, humiliating.
- Pish posh.

251
00:15:58.981 --> 00:16:01.151
I think it's a wonderful idea.

252
00:16:01.233 --> 00:16:05.741
But the master doesn't want it.
His castle, his rules.

253
00:16:05.821 --> 00:16:07.781
It's not fair.

254
00:16:07.865 --> 00:16:11.945
He's right. It's not fair!

255
00:16:12.036 --> 00:16:14.406
Don't whine, glasses.

256
00:16:14.496 --> 00:16:17.036
Sorry.

257
00:16:17.124 --> 00:16:20.589
Look at us, squabbling and bickering.

258
00:16:20.669 --> 00:16:23.299
Breaks my heart to see it, it does.

259
00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.300
And we used to be at our very best
at Christmas.

260
00:16:26.383 --> 00:16:30.641
Why, we used to prepare
a feast for the entire castle.

261
00:16:30.721 --> 00:16:34.061
Ah! You could have some stuffed turkey.

262
00:16:34.141 --> 00:16:36.771
- Cranberry sauce.
- Shortbread cookies.

263
00:16:36.852 --> 00:16:38.899
- Mince pies.
- Potatoes.

264
00:16:38.979 --> 00:16:41.149
- Gravy.
- And Christmas pudding!

265
00:16:41.231 --> 00:16:44.691
Uh, pudding? With... With custard?

266
00:16:44.777 --> 00:16:48.987
What do you think we are, barbarians?
Of course with custard.

267
00:16:49.073 --> 00:16:51.743
And raisins and brandy,

268
00:16:51.825 --> 00:16:54.405
and all those things you like.

269
00:16:59.375 --> 00:17:01.955
- All right.
- Yes!

270
00:17:02.044 --> 00:17:05.384
But if the master finds out about this,
he will be furious,

271
00:17:05.464 --> 00:17:08.344
so, everybody, keep quiet.

272
00:17:08.425 --> 00:17:11.465
Come on!
What are we waiting for, Christmas?

273
00:17:11.553 --> 00:17:14.101
Good heavens, we don't have
much time. It's Christmas Eve!

274
00:17:14.181 --> 00:17:17.911
- I'll see to the dinner.
- I'll get some mistletoe.

275
00:17:18.076 --> 00:17:19.846
We need to brighten this place up.

276
00:17:19.937 --> 00:17:22.227
Belle, I know someone who will help.

277
00:17:22.314 --> 00:17:26.244
Now, now, wait for me.
I'm in charge here. I'm in charge.

278
00:17:27.945 --> 00:17:29.945
Wait for me!

279
00:17:31.323 --> 00:17:34.743
One-thousand one, one-thousand two,

280
00:17:34.827 --> 00:17:36.697
one-thousand three...

281
00:17:36.787 --> 00:17:40.287
- Are we there yet?
- Not yet.

282
00:17:40.374 --> 00:17:43.464
Oh, boy, there sure
are a lot of stairs here.

283
00:17:43.544 --> 00:17:46.342
One-thousand seven, one-thousand eight,

284
00:17:46.422 --> 00:17:49.452
one-thousand nine, one-thousand ten...

285
00:17:57.766 --> 00:17:59.136
Hello?

286
00:17:59.852 --> 00:18:01.192
Hello?

287
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.730
Do not be afraid, <i>mes amis.</i>

288
00:18:05.816 --> 00:18:09.986
It is I, Lumiere.
We have come to pay you a little visit.

289
00:18:14.491 --> 00:18:17.581
- Lumiere?
- Angelique.

290
00:18:18.162 --> 00:18:21.460
Ah, Lumiere, finally.

291
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.840
I thought we were to be locked away
in this dusty attic forever.

292
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.670
Ah, Angelique, <i>mon amour.</i>

293
00:18:29.089 --> 00:18:33.259
Your eyes are still so lovely
after all these years.

294
00:18:33.343 --> 00:18:35.263
Lumiere, please!

295
00:18:35.345 --> 00:18:37.635
You'll tarnish the halo.

296
00:18:38.849 --> 00:18:42.139
Oh, yes. This is Belle, our guest.

297
00:18:42.227 --> 00:18:46.017
- Pleased to meet you.
- And this is Angelique.

298
00:18:46.106 --> 00:18:48.066
She is the castle decorator.

299
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.780
You mean was the castle decorator.

300
00:18:50.861 --> 00:18:54.451
I am not responsible
for this baroque atrocity.

301
00:18:54.531 --> 00:18:56.578
When I was in charge,

302
00:18:56.658 --> 00:19:00.578
the castle was full of light and beauty.

303
00:19:00.662 --> 00:19:03.832
But, <i>chérie,</i> that is why we have come.

304
00:19:03.916 --> 00:19:06.536
Gather around, <i>mes enfants.</i>

305
00:19:06.627 --> 00:19:12.469
We are planning the greatest
Christmas celebration ever.

306
00:19:20.808 --> 00:19:22.638
No, stop!

307
00:19:23.726 --> 00:19:24.806
What is it, <i>chérie?</i>

308
00:19:24.895 --> 00:19:27.015
Why do you raise my hopes...

309
00:19:27.105 --> 00:19:31.815
I... I mean, their hopes...
Only to have them dashed?

310
00:19:31.902 --> 00:19:34.072
Well, no more.

311
00:19:35.531 --> 00:19:37.031
But it's Christmas Eve.

312
00:19:37.115 --> 00:19:40.075
Without you, we'll never get
the castle decorated in time.

313
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.750
Ha! Christmas? Hmph!
I refuse to hope for it anymore.

314
00:19:44.832 --> 00:19:46.962
I will not be disappointed again.

315
00:19:47.042 --> 00:19:50.132
But this is to be
the greatest celebration ever.

316
00:19:50.212 --> 00:19:52.342
We cannot do it without you.

317
00:19:52.422 --> 00:19:56.052
Well, but of course you cannot.

318
00:19:56.134 --> 00:19:59.099
Christmas takes planning and organization.

319
00:19:59.179 --> 00:20:04.059
No. No, I won't do it.
It won't change anything.

320
00:20:04.142 --> 00:20:06.192
I believe it will.

321
00:20:06.937 --> 00:20:09.897
<i>There is more to</i>

322
00:20:09.982 --> 00:20:12.732
<i>This time of year</i>

323
00:20:12.818 --> 00:20:16.448
<i>Than sleigh bells and holly</i>

324
00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.828
<i>Mistletoe and snow</i>

325
00:20:19.908 --> 00:20:22.788
<i>Those things come and go</i>

326
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:26.040
<i>Much deeper than snow</i>

327
00:20:26.123 --> 00:20:31.840
<i>Stronger than the strongest love
we'll know</i>

328
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.818
<i>We'll ever know</i>

329
00:20:40.888 --> 00:20:45.178
<i>As long as there's Christmas</i>

330
00:20:45.267 --> 00:20:49.397
<i>I truly believe</i>

331
00:20:49.479 --> 00:20:53.689
<i>That hope is the greatest</i>

332
00:20:53.775 --> 00:20:58.195
<i>Of the gifts we'll receive</i>

333
00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.410
<i>As long as there's Christmas</i>

334
00:21:02.492 --> 00:21:06.542
<i>We'll all be just fine</i>

335
00:21:06.622 --> 00:21:10.502
<i>A star shines above us</i>

336
00:21:10.584 --> 00:21:14.844
<i>Lighting your way and mine</i>

337
00:21:17.007 --> 00:21:21.177
<i>Just as long as there's Christmas
there will be Christmas pud</i>

338
00:21:21.595 --> 00:21:22.595
<i>Tons of turkey</i>

339
00:21:22.679 --> 00:21:25.269
<i>And cranberry sauce and mince pies
if we're good</i>

340
00:21:25.349 --> 00:21:29.479
<i>- Lots of logs on the fire
- Lots of gifts on the tree</i>

341
00:21:29.561 --> 00:21:31.771
<i>All wrapped up in red ribbons</i>

342
00:21:31.855 --> 00:21:33.815
<i>Wonder if there's one for me</i>

343
00:21:33.899 --> 00:21:37.989
<i>We're due for a party
Where on earth do we start</i>

344
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:42.119
<i>I may wear my tiara
you bought me in Montmartre</i>

345
00:21:42.199 --> 00:21:44.369
<i>All the silver will sparkle</i>

346
00:21:44.451 --> 00:21:46.451
<i>And the china will gleam</i>

347
00:21:46.536 --> 00:21:50.786
<i>And we'll be as shiny
as a brand-new centime</i>

348
00:21:50.874 --> 00:21:54.923
<i>- After dinner we'll play games
- Till the morning breaks through</i>

349
00:21:55.003 --> 00:21:56.800
<i>Then we'll meet in the garden</i>

350
00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.760
<i>- This is what we shall do</i>
- <i>We will build</i>

351
00:21:59.841 --> 00:22:03.301
<i>We will build a snowman
that'll reach to the sky</i>

352
00:22:03.387 --> 00:22:07.847
<i>It will stay up until July</i>

353
00:22:17.776 --> 00:22:20.236
What are you doing? Stop, stop, stop.

354
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:24.119
Put me down. Put me down.
This is ridiculous.

355
00:22:24.199 --> 00:22:27.369
Everyone knows that
the lights go on first.

356
00:22:29.579 --> 00:22:32.789
I don't want to go
all the way up there on the top.

357
00:22:32.874 --> 00:22:36.714
<i>As long as there's Christmas</i>

358
00:22:36.795 --> 00:22:40.665
<i>I truly believe</i>

359
00:22:40.757 --> 00:22:44.797
<i>That hope is the greatest</i>

360
00:22:44.886 --> 00:22:48.766
<i>Of the gifts we'll receive</i>

361
00:22:48.849 --> 00:22:52.809
<i>As long as there's Christmas</i>

362
00:22:52.894 --> 00:22:56.818
<i>We'll all be just fine</i>

363
00:22:56.898 --> 00:23:03.608
<i>There'll always be Christmas</i>

364
00:23:03.947 --> 00:23:08.987
<i>So there always will be a time</i>

365
00:23:09.077 --> 00:23:11.157
<i>When the world</i>

366
00:23:11.246 --> 00:23:14.366
<i>Is filled with peace</i>

367
00:23:14.458 --> 00:23:20.088
<i>And warmth</i>

368
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.470
We're gonna have
the greatest Christmas ever.

369
00:23:24.551 --> 00:23:26.971
Oh, I hope so, Chip.

370
00:23:29.639 --> 00:23:32.099
You on the left,
you on the right, follow me.

371
00:23:32.184 --> 00:23:34.439
There is decorating to be done.

372
00:23:34.519 --> 00:23:38.979
Yes, yes, yes, yes. But keep in mind,
the master mustn't find out.

373
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.280
Ooh, yes.

374
00:23:44.696 --> 00:23:48.156
Christmas? She's planning Christmas?

375
00:23:48.408 --> 00:23:51.908
Yes. Awful, isn't it?

376
00:24:00.253 --> 00:24:02.923
Perhaps she doesn't know
how I feel about Christmas.

377
00:24:03.006 --> 00:24:05.046
- But she does know.
- Hmm?

378
00:24:05.133 --> 00:24:08.973
She just doesn't care like I do.

379
00:24:11.139 --> 00:24:13.679
She's actually trying to bring
Christmas back to the castle.

380
00:24:13.767 --> 00:24:18.147
And you know how much
we despise Christmas.

381
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.690
The day my life ended.

382
00:24:23.026 --> 00:24:26.946
- Bring me my presents!
- Your Highness,

383
00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:30.910
please accept this humble gift
as a token of our appreciation.

384
00:24:30.992 --> 00:24:33.248
I know I speak for everyone when...

385
00:24:33.328 --> 00:24:35.458
Ah, just give it to me!

386
00:24:36.748 --> 00:24:40.458
A storybook? You call this a present?

387
00:24:40.544 --> 00:24:43.592
I hope you have something
better for me, Forte.

388
00:24:43.672 --> 00:24:46.682
Yes, sir. Of course, master.

389
00:24:51.513 --> 00:24:53.183
What is that?

390
00:24:53.265 --> 00:24:57.305
Um, a small piece in your honor, master.

391
00:24:57.644 --> 00:25:01.474
Ew! I hate it.
Forte, that stuff is gloomy.

392
00:25:04.734 --> 00:25:07.244
Who disturbs my Christmas?

393
00:25:08.989 --> 00:25:11.279
Please, take this rose

394
00:25:11.366 --> 00:25:15.696
in exchange for shelter
from the bitter cold.

395
00:25:17.346 --> 00:25:21.069
I don't need a rose.
Go away, you wretched old hag!

396
00:25:24.254 --> 00:25:28.844
You have been deceived
by your own cold heart.

397
00:25:28.925 --> 00:25:32.385
A curse upon your house and all within it.

398
00:25:33.597 --> 00:25:37.597
Until you have found one
to love you as you are,

399
00:25:37.684 --> 00:25:41.774
you shall remain forever a beast.

400
00:25:50.864 --> 00:25:53.744
But we've come so far since then.

401
00:25:53.825 --> 00:25:57.535
We've risen above the tragedy.

402
00:25:57.621 --> 00:26:00.210
Where is she?

403
00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:03.670
I believe she's gone to the boiler room,

404
00:26:03.752 --> 00:26:06.922
or so, a little birdie told me.

405
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.900
Tweet, tweet, tweet.

406
00:26:32.572 --> 00:26:34.492
Hey, hey, hey. Come on.
Get out of the way.

407
00:26:34.574 --> 00:26:36.454
We're workin' here.

408
00:26:37.035 --> 00:26:40.535
- Excuse me.
- Let's go. Let's go.

409
00:26:40.622 --> 00:26:43.670
All right, you guys.
Now, get back to work.

410
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:46.490
The castle doesn't heat itself, you know.

411
00:26:47.587 --> 00:26:50.087
So, what can I do you for, lady?

412
00:26:50.173 --> 00:26:53.430
- I'm looking for a log.
- All right. Logs we got.

413
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:56.600
What do you want? Hard wood?
Soft wood? We got it all.

414
00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.220
We got birch, maple, pine, oak...

415
00:27:00.107 --> 00:27:04.019
Concrete. My head. Don't worry. It'll pass.

416
00:27:04.104 --> 00:27:06.274
So, make up your mind already.

417
00:27:06.356 --> 00:27:09.106
Is it all right if I just browse?

418
00:27:09.192 --> 00:27:12.492
Suit yourself. Take your time.
Me, I got work to do.

419
00:27:30.505 --> 00:27:33.005
Hey, what am I payin' you for,
being boring?

420
00:27:33.091 --> 00:27:36.221
Do that on your own time. Get out of here!

421
00:27:37.971 --> 00:27:39.351
Yes.

422
00:27:50.817 --> 00:27:52.737
What are you hiding?

423
00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:02.700
It's a Yule log.

424
00:28:02.912 --> 00:28:04.000
Huh?

425
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.750
A... A Yule log.

426
00:28:06.666 --> 00:28:09.036
It's a wonderful tradition.

427
00:28:09.127 --> 00:28:12.417
One log is chosen and everyone
in the house touches it

428
00:28:12.505 --> 00:28:14.665
and makes a Christmas wish.

429
00:28:15.091 --> 00:28:17.431
Mmm, wishes are stupid.

430
00:28:19.304 --> 00:28:22.519
You made a Christmas wish last year.

431
00:28:22.599 --> 00:28:25.949
Is this what you wished for?

432
00:28:29.773 --> 00:28:30.983
No.

433
00:28:33.151 --> 00:28:35.281
But I will keep wishing.

434
00:28:35.695 --> 00:28:37.655
And when the log is burned
on Christmas morning...

435
00:28:37.739 --> 00:28:39.619
There will be no Christmas.

436
00:28:39.699 --> 00:28:44.369
- But...
- No! I am the master here.

437
00:28:44.454 --> 00:28:47.168
How can you be so selfish?

438
00:28:47.248 --> 00:28:50.338
You cannot possibly understand.

439
00:28:50.418 --> 00:28:53.668
You have no idea
what it's like to lose everything,

440
00:28:53.755 --> 00:28:55.915
to be trapped in your own castle,

441
00:28:56.007 --> 00:28:58.297
to be a... A... A...

442
00:28:58.385 --> 00:28:59.795
Prisoner?

443
00:29:01.596 --> 00:29:05.056
The only one holding us prisoner here
is you.

444
00:29:05.141 --> 00:29:07.231
Well, I'm not giving up.

445
00:29:12.482 --> 00:29:14.152
Prisoner.

446
00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:36.420
Hiya, Belle. You should see the ballroom.

447
00:29:36.506 --> 00:29:39.086
It's all decorated and pretty
and there's garlands everywhere.

448
00:29:39.175 --> 00:29:41.085
I think the master's gonna
be really excited

449
00:29:41.177 --> 00:29:43.257
when he finds out about Christmas.

450
00:29:43.346 --> 00:29:46.426
Well, he... He already knows.

451
00:29:46.516 --> 00:29:49.266
Really? Was he excited?

452
00:29:49.352 --> 00:29:52.522
Actually, Chip, he's forbidden it.

453
00:29:53.565 --> 00:29:57.355
But I thought
he couldn't forbid Christmas.

454
00:29:58.695 --> 00:30:01.445
You know, Chip, he can't.

455
00:30:01.531 --> 00:30:03.870
We'll have Christmas with or without him.

456
00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:09.080
Hurray! Can we get a tree now, Belle?
It's the only thing we're missing.

457
00:30:09.164 --> 00:30:12.134
All right, then. Let's go get a tree.

458
00:30:12.625 --> 00:30:14.205
But first...

459
00:30:15.211 --> 00:30:16.381
Shh.

460
00:30:26.848 --> 00:30:30.308
Psst, Belle. The master. Hurry.

461
00:30:51.498 --> 00:30:53.418
What about this one?

462
00:31:03.092 --> 00:31:07.152
Nah, too skinny. Come on.

463
00:31:19.484 --> 00:31:20.904
Ooo la-la.

464
00:31:22.362 --> 00:31:26.322
- Ohh, Lumiere.
- She's beautiful, no?

465
00:31:26.407 --> 00:31:29.037
Yes, and I'm hideous.

466
00:31:29.118 --> 00:31:31.408
Not to mention ill-tempered.

467
00:31:31.496 --> 00:31:34.806
What? What is that?

468
00:31:34.891 --> 00:31:37.871
Ooh, it looks like a Christmas present.

469
00:31:45.802 --> 00:31:48.302
Oh-ho-ho. It's for you, master.

470
00:31:48.388 --> 00:31:50.968
It's from a girl.

471
00:31:53.142 --> 00:31:56.312
- Mrs. Potts?
- No. From Belle.

472
00:31:57.981 --> 00:31:59.321
Belle?

473
00:32:02.777 --> 00:32:05.237
Uh-uh-uh. Master, you can't open it.

474
00:32:05.321 --> 00:32:07.701
Well, why not? It's for me, isn't it?

475
00:32:07.782 --> 00:32:10.079
Because it's not yet Christmas.

476
00:32:11.661 --> 00:32:16.371
Master, we all understand
how you feel about Christmas.

477
00:32:16.457 --> 00:32:21.247
But when a woman gives a man a gift,
she's saying, "I care about you."

478
00:32:21.379 --> 00:32:22.549
Hmm.

479
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:24.590
But I don't have a gift for her.

480
00:32:24.674 --> 00:32:26.729
It is not too late.

481
00:32:28.469 --> 00:32:32.139
Well, I guess I could
get her a little something.

482
00:32:37.103 --> 00:32:39.442
Forte, stop the noise!

483
00:32:39.522 --> 00:32:42.192
Noise? Noise?

484
00:32:42.734 --> 00:32:44.714
This is my masterpiece.

485
00:32:45.862 --> 00:32:47.452
Master.

486
00:32:48.573 --> 00:32:50.620
I... I want you to compose a song.

487
00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:54.040
- It's a present for Belle.
- What? Belle?

488
00:32:55.204 --> 00:32:57.834
And make it happy!

489
00:32:57.915 --> 00:33:01.875
Oh, but happiness is so depressing.

490
00:33:02.503 --> 00:33:05.633
What's next? Love songs?

491
00:33:07.508 --> 00:33:09.718
Wedding marches?

492
00:33:11.638 --> 00:33:15.138
It's all that girl's fault.

493
00:33:17.518 --> 00:33:19.308
What about this one?

494
00:33:19.395 --> 00:33:24.275
- Hmm, too wiggly.
- Too wiggly.

495
00:33:24.359 --> 00:33:25.488
Fife!

496
00:33:28.446 --> 00:33:29.606
Pay attention.

497
00:33:29.697 --> 00:33:34.407
I need you to pace when I think.
The girl is evil, I tell you.

498
00:33:34.494 --> 00:33:36.624
She pulls him from my grasp.

499
00:33:36.704 --> 00:33:39.334
She fills his head with dreams of love

500
00:33:39.415 --> 00:33:42.125
and hope and Christmas!

501
00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:45.800
Well, what you gonna do?
You can't stop Christmas.

502
00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:50.890
No, but I can stop the girl.

503
00:33:54.889 --> 00:33:58.429
Chip, this is the last one.

504
00:33:58.518 --> 00:34:02.398
That's not it. That's just a weed
wishing it was a tree.

505
00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.860
Chip, we've looked
at every tree on the grounds.

506
00:34:05.942 --> 00:34:08.698
But it's more this way than that.

507
00:34:08.778 --> 00:34:10.658
It will have to do.

508
00:34:13.574 --> 00:34:16.454
- What a headache I have.
- I'm sorry.

509
00:34:16.536 --> 00:34:18.326
I... I'll get a saw.

510
00:34:18.413 --> 00:34:21.461
No, that's fine.
I don't want I should put you out.

511
00:34:21.541 --> 00:34:23.251
Oh, all right.

512
00:34:24.961 --> 00:34:28.551
Do you have some oil?
I just thought a little massage...

513
00:34:28.631 --> 00:34:31.551
But if it's no, it's no. Go on.
What are you waiting for?

514
00:34:31.634 --> 00:34:33.764
Knock yourself out.

515
00:34:34.721 --> 00:34:36.931
You never get headaches, I guess.
Lucky you.

516
00:34:37.014 --> 00:34:40.313
- Really, I can get a saw.
- Who wants a saw?

517
00:34:40.393 --> 00:34:43.733
I said go ahead with the whacking
and the hitting. Who's stopping you?

518
00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:47.480
What is that?

519
00:34:54.323 --> 00:34:55.493
Ohh.

520
00:34:56.409 --> 00:34:58.449
It's beautiful.

521
00:35:02.165 --> 00:35:06.175
And now for a little Fife.

522
00:35:13.301 --> 00:35:15.011
Sultan, wait!

523
00:35:16.512 --> 00:35:20.772
Don't worry yourself about me.
I'll just sit here. Snow is fine.

524
00:35:21.225 --> 00:35:23.435
A little wet, but who's complaining?

525
00:35:23.728 --> 00:35:28.318
Yes, my dear. Come to me.

526
00:35:28.691 --> 00:35:31.361
Come here, boy. Come here.

527
00:35:39.994 --> 00:35:43.374
Good doggy. Nice doggy.

528
00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:47.040
- Sultan?
- Back off, doggy.

529
00:35:49.879 --> 00:35:51.419
Hello?

530
00:35:53.382 --> 00:35:54.762
Hello?

531
00:35:54.842 --> 00:35:57.512
Well, maybe there's nobody here.

532
00:35:58.221 --> 00:36:01.018
Maybe we should go.

533
00:36:02.308 --> 00:36:04.518
What's the matter, Sultan?

534
00:36:07.939 --> 00:36:12.069
Oh, hello. I don't believe we've met.
I... I'm Belle.

535
00:36:12.401 --> 00:36:15.241
- And you are?
- Fife.

536
00:36:16.171 --> 00:36:20.791
Down, boy, down.
We heard the most beautiful music.

537
00:36:21.244 --> 00:36:23.583
- Was it you?
- Me?

538
00:36:23.663 --> 00:36:27.003
You thought that was me?

539
00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.830
<i>Mademoiselle,</i> please.

540
00:36:33.798 --> 00:36:36.928
I am Maestro Forte,

541
00:36:37.009 --> 00:36:41.389
court composer
and your most humble servant.

542
00:36:41.472 --> 00:36:44.682
Pleased to meet you, <i>Monsieur</i> Forte.
I'm Belle.

543
00:36:44.767 --> 00:36:49.147
Yes. The entire castle is talking
about you, child.

544
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:54.030
They say you're planning
a Christmas gala. Marvelous idea.

545
00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:59.280
The very thing to shatter
the master's dark and gloomy past.

546
00:36:59.365 --> 00:37:03.575
But you must make this
the grandest celebration ever.

547
00:37:03.661 --> 00:37:05.081
- Have you gifts?
- Yep.

548
00:37:05.162 --> 00:37:06.162
- Food?
- Yep.

549
00:37:06.247 --> 00:37:08.367
- Garlands, ribbons, wreaths?
- Check.

550
00:37:08.457 --> 00:37:10.627
Spangles and "fandangles"?

551
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:13.549
The trinkets, the trimmings,
the trappings?

552
00:37:13.629 --> 00:37:17.219
- Yep, we got 'em all.
- A tree?

553
00:37:19.343 --> 00:37:21.763
See, Belle? I told you.

554
00:37:21.846 --> 00:37:23.466
Well, we found one.

555
00:37:23.556 --> 00:37:26.726
But it was on the piddlin' side of puny.

556
00:37:28.519 --> 00:37:31.899
But did you look in the Black Forest?

557
00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.900
There you will find a tree

558
00:37:34.984 --> 00:37:38.282
better than any you can dream of.

559
00:37:38.362 --> 00:37:40.822
Better? We gotta go, Belle!

560
00:37:42.658 --> 00:37:45.368
- We gotta!
- Chip, we can't.

561
00:37:46.203 --> 00:37:50.083
I... I promised your master
I wouldn't leave the castle grounds.

562
00:37:50.166 --> 00:37:51.326
I gave my word.

563
00:37:51.417 --> 00:37:55.167
Chin up, son.
There's a profound lesson here.

564
00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:01.680
Keeping your word is much more
important than bringing joy to another.

565
00:38:01.761 --> 00:38:03.891
You're twisting what I said.

566
00:38:03.971 --> 00:38:06.931
Not at all. I agree with you.

567
00:38:07.016 --> 00:38:11.146
Look after yourself.
Let the master do the same.

568
00:38:11.228 --> 00:38:13.108
Never mind that the tree

569
00:38:13.189 --> 00:38:17.488
was always his favorite part of Christmas.

570
00:38:17.568 --> 00:38:21.358
Please, Belle? Please?

571
00:38:22.865 --> 00:38:24.775
It looks dangerous.

572
00:38:25.567 --> 00:38:28.957
<i>Mademoiselle,</i> you are in more danger

573
00:38:29.038 --> 00:38:32.458
in this very room, I assure you.

574
00:38:33.876 --> 00:38:34.916
All right.

575
00:38:35.002 --> 00:38:36.799
- Yes!
- We'll take Phillippe.

576
00:38:36.879 --> 00:38:38.968
If we hurry, we can be back by nightfall.

577
00:38:39.048 --> 00:38:42.548
- Hurray!
<i>- Au revoir, Monsieur</i> Forte.

578
00:38:43.052 --> 00:38:45.852
You'll keep my secret, won't you?

579
00:38:46.555 --> 00:38:48.805
Of course, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

580
00:38:48.891 --> 00:38:52.271
The master will remain
completely in the dark.

581
00:38:52.353 --> 00:38:54.153
<i>Au revoir,</i> Fife.

582
00:38:56.524 --> 00:38:59.494
Fife! I want you to follow her.

583
00:38:59.819 --> 00:39:03.659
Make sure they don't come back.

584
00:39:03.739 --> 00:39:07.119
Oh, yeah, but, Maestro, she's so nice.

585
00:39:07.201 --> 00:39:09.661
When you're finished fawning, Fife,

586
00:39:09.745 --> 00:39:14.625
perhaps you can recommend
someone else to play your solo.

587
00:39:14.709 --> 00:39:17.089
No! I'm going. I'm going.

588
00:39:27.722 --> 00:39:31.772
- Cogsworth!
- Oh, dear. Yes. Coming. Coming.

589
00:39:32.309 --> 00:39:34.649
Cogsworth!

590
00:39:34.729 --> 00:39:38.979
Running, running. Almost there.
You bellowed, sir?

591
00:39:39.066 --> 00:39:42.066
Find Belle. I... Uh...

592
00:39:42.153 --> 00:39:46.369
Well, I... She has to hear a song.

593
00:39:46.449 --> 00:39:49.119
Yes, sir. Right away, sir. Uh, yes.

594
00:39:49.618 --> 00:39:52.868
Splendid. Yes, well... Splendid.

595
00:39:52.955 --> 00:39:53.995
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

596
00:39:55.541 --> 00:39:58.001
Belle. Belle?

597
00:39:58.085 --> 00:40:00.245
Where is she? Belle?

598
00:40:01.338 --> 00:40:03.378
Careful, careful.

599
00:40:03.466 --> 00:40:06.546
Too fast! Get out of the way! Stop!

600
00:40:07.261 --> 00:40:08.261
Huh!

601
00:40:08.345 --> 00:40:09.635
Amateurs.

602
00:40:10.097 --> 00:40:14.187
Belle? Here... Excuse me. Hello?

603
00:40:14.268 --> 00:40:17.608
Has anyone seen Belle?
I can't find her anywhere.

604
00:40:17.688 --> 00:40:19.818
And the master is demanding
to see her now.

605
00:40:19.899 --> 00:40:22.399
He's got a song he wants her to hear.

606
00:40:23.694 --> 00:40:28.661
Last I saw of her, she was going
with Chip to look for a Christmas tree.

607
00:40:30.576 --> 00:40:33.326
Right. We must conduct
a search of the grounds.

608
00:40:33.412 --> 00:40:38.671
- Lumiere, you're with me.
- Cogsworth! I'm waiting!

609
00:40:38.751 --> 00:40:41.881
Oh, dear. Running, running, running.
I'm almost there, sir.

610
00:40:42.838 --> 00:40:45.468
Mrs. Potts, stall the master.
All right, Lumiere, we're...

611
00:40:45.549 --> 00:40:48.219
Lumiere? Wait, I'm leading.

612
00:40:48.302 --> 00:40:50.472
Me first, you second.

613
00:40:52.473 --> 00:40:56.353
Belle! Belle! Where is she?

614
00:40:56.435 --> 00:40:59.105
Belle? Belle?

615
00:40:59.188 --> 00:41:00.608
Belle, where are you?

616
00:41:00.689 --> 00:41:02.939
Lumiere, wait.

617
00:41:10.157 --> 00:41:12.367
The Black Forest!

618
00:41:13.119 --> 00:41:15.079
Come along. Hurry now!

619
00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:19.460
Oh, no. This is catastrophic!

620
00:41:20.376 --> 00:41:22.746
Cogsworth, quit dawdling.

621
00:41:22.837 --> 00:41:24.957
I'm not dawdling. I'm waddling.

622
00:41:25.047 --> 00:41:29.717
Well, don't waddle then.
We're in a hurry, you lazy old clock.

623
00:41:45.734 --> 00:41:48.404
Why am I still waiting?

624
00:41:48.904 --> 00:41:52.204
- Mrs. Potts!
- Coming, sir! Coming!

625
00:41:52.658 --> 00:41:54.618
What a brisk day!

626
00:41:54.702 --> 00:41:58.292
Why, you look positively chilled
to the bone.

627
00:41:58.873 --> 00:42:00.503
Where's Belle?

628
00:42:00.583 --> 00:42:04.503
How about a nice cup of tea, sir?
Just a spot.

629
00:42:04.879 --> 00:42:06.049
Hmm.

630
00:42:07.089 --> 00:42:09.589
Forte, play Belle's song!

631
00:42:12.511 --> 00:42:13.931
Hot.

632
00:42:15.472 --> 00:42:17.272
You're not singing!

633
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:24.440
<i>Deck the halls with boughs of holly</i>

634
00:42:24.523 --> 00:42:28.280
<i>Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la</i>

635
00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.650
Louder!

636
00:42:30.487 --> 00:42:32.487
<i>'Tis the season</i>

637
00:42:32.573 --> 00:42:35.871
A bit more tea, sir?
Good for the heart, you know.

638
00:42:35.951 --> 00:42:37.039
No, thank you.

639
00:42:37.119 --> 00:42:39.119
- Just a spot?
- No more.

640
00:42:39.205 --> 00:42:42.285
- Well, there's always room for tea, love.
- I said, "No more."

641
00:42:42.374 --> 00:42:44.713
- Oh, dearie me!
- Mrs. Potts,

642
00:42:44.793 --> 00:42:47.800
are you trying to distract me?

643
00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.970
Goodness, no, sir.

644
00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:53.889
Heavens. Is that a yellow-bellied,
double-breasted sapsucker?

645
00:42:53.969 --> 00:42:57.139
- Rare this time of year.
- Enough! Where's Cogsworth?

646
00:42:57.223 --> 00:42:59.353
- Where's Belle?
- Belle?

647
00:42:59.433 --> 00:43:03.063
We can't find her, sir.

648
00:43:03.145 --> 00:43:04.555
What?

649
00:43:04.647 --> 00:43:06.017
Leave me!

650
00:43:08.692 --> 00:43:10.692
Show me the girl.

651
00:43:16.325 --> 00:43:18.695
- I will bring her back!
- No!

652
00:43:18.911 --> 00:43:21.161
Um, she's abandoned you.

653
00:43:21.447 --> 00:43:24.247
Listen to your old friend, won't you?

654
00:43:24.333 --> 00:43:27.543
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Led you astray?

655
00:43:27.628 --> 00:43:30.458
No. But the girl...

656
00:43:31.006 --> 00:43:35.176
<i>The quickest way to break your heart</i>

657
00:43:35.261 --> 00:43:38.931
<i>Make you depressed and ill</i>

658
00:43:39.014 --> 00:43:43.144
<i>Is to get tangled up inside</i>

659
00:43:43.227 --> 00:43:46.977
<i>The side effects could kill</i>

660
00:43:47.064 --> 00:43:51.154
<i>All passion is a waste of time</i>

661
00:43:51.235 --> 00:43:53.855
<i>A deadly game</i> pour vous

662
00:43:55.064 --> 00:43:59.330
<i>I am your friend, your</i> cher ami

663
00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:04.040
<i>I wouldn't lie to you</i>

664
00:44:05.165 --> 00:44:08.495
<i>If you must love someone may I suggest</i>

665
00:44:08.585 --> 00:44:11.875
<i>You love yourself, just think it through</i>

666
00:44:11.964 --> 00:44:15.384
<i>You'll never leave
and you will find you'll get more rest</i>

667
00:44:15.467 --> 00:44:18.797
<i>You'll always feel as good as new</i>

668
00:44:18.887 --> 00:44:22.017
<i>Your freedom is the most
important thing, my friend</i>

669
00:44:22.099 --> 00:44:25.389
<i>You must be strong, you mustn't bend</i>

670
00:44:25.477 --> 00:44:27.477
<i>Don't talk for hours, don't send flowers</i>

671
00:44:27.563 --> 00:44:29.568
<i>Don't write poems
Don't sing songs and dance</i>

672
00:44:29.648 --> 00:44:32.398
<i>Beneath the stars that shine above</i>

673
00:44:32.484 --> 00:44:35.404
<i>Don't fall in love</i>

674
00:44:35.988 --> 00:44:39.278
Oh, don't do it.

675
00:44:41.035 --> 00:44:45.245
<i>As soon as your heart rules your head</i>

676
00:44:45.331 --> 00:44:48.831
<i>Your life is not your own</i>

677
00:44:48.917 --> 00:44:52.797
<i>It's hell when someone's always there</i>

678
00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:56.800
<i>It's bliss to be alone</i>

679
00:44:56.884 --> 00:45:00.804
<i>And love of any kind is bad</i>

680
00:45:00.888 --> 00:45:04.388
<i>A dog, a child, a cat</i>

681
00:45:04.475 --> 00:45:08.975
<i>They take up so much precious time</i>

682
00:45:09.063 --> 00:45:13.533
<i>Now, where's the sense in that</i>

683
00:45:15.527 --> 00:45:18.947
<i>Love takes the wildest heart
and makes it tame</i>

684
00:45:19.031 --> 00:45:22.281
<i>If you're turned on then just turn off</i>

685
00:45:22.368 --> 00:45:25.868
<i>Emotions are a thing
all great men overcame</i>

686
00:45:25.954 --> 00:45:29.124
<i>Please, don't make this</i> grande catastrophe

687
00:45:29.208 --> 00:45:32.628
<i>Don't get attached to anyone or anything</i>

688
00:45:32.711 --> 00:45:36.010
<i>There's nothing worse
than things that cling</i>

689
00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:37.800
<i>You'll go to pot, you'll turn to drink</i>

690
00:45:37.883 --> 00:45:39.513
<i>You'll never rest, you'll end up mad</i>

691
00:45:39.593 --> 00:45:43.263
<i>And looking like some poor demented dove</i>

692
00:45:43.347 --> 00:45:48.887
<i>Don't fall in love</i>

693
00:45:48.977 --> 00:45:52.147
<i>Don't fall in love!</i>

694
00:45:56.527 --> 00:45:59.317
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

695
00:45:59.405 --> 00:46:02.565
They cannot mix bells with holly.

696
00:46:02.658 --> 00:46:06.288
Still, I have to admit,
not bad for amateurs.

697
00:46:22.553 --> 00:46:25.353
I knew this was hopeless.

698
00:46:56.879 --> 00:46:59.209
There. That's it! That's it!

699
00:47:02.217 --> 00:47:04.757
Oh, Chip, it's perfect.

700
00:47:11.602 --> 00:47:15.982
- Do you see her?
- Not yet. Now, come along. Hurry!

701
00:47:19.485 --> 00:47:22.315
You go on. I'll never make it.

702
00:47:25.741 --> 00:47:27.281
Save yourself.

703
00:47:28.744 --> 00:47:31.458
Ah, it will be summer
before we reach them.

704
00:47:31.538 --> 00:47:33.288
What the... Whoa!

705
00:47:34.541 --> 00:47:35.631
Oh, dear!

706
00:47:40.204 --> 00:47:43.971
Faster! Faster!
I think we finally found a use for you.

707
00:47:44.051 --> 00:47:46.681
Clock boarding! No, snow clocking!

708
00:47:47.513 --> 00:47:48.973
Whatever!

709
00:47:59.942 --> 00:48:04.032
- It's the best tree ever!
- Chip, you're right.

710
00:48:04.112 --> 00:48:08.282
Merry Christmas! And a happy Hanukkah!

711
00:48:08.951 --> 00:48:12.081
We better hurry. It's getting very stormy.

712
00:48:15.123 --> 00:48:17.213
Again with the chopping.

713
00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:21.890
Oh, I gotta do something.
Forte's counting on me.

714
00:48:27.636 --> 00:48:30.096
Timber!

715
00:48:38.146 --> 00:48:40.146
Take it away, Phillippe!

716
00:48:52.244 --> 00:48:53.584
Oh, no!

717
00:49:06.842 --> 00:49:08.092
Fife?

718
00:49:08.876 --> 00:49:12.354
Uh, hi, Belle. Nice tree.

719
00:49:12.889 --> 00:49:14.769
What are you doing way out here?

720
00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:17.770
Uh, nothin'. I just was walkin'.

721
00:49:17.853 --> 00:49:21.163
I mean, I love the bitter cold. I mean...

722
00:49:27.195 --> 00:49:28.735
Phillippe!

723
00:49:33.243 --> 00:49:34.703
Oh, no!

724
00:49:38.541 --> 00:49:41.630
The tree, Belle!
We're gonna lose the tree!

725
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:43.250
Whoa!

726
00:49:44.087 --> 00:49:46.087
Chip! Oh!

727
00:49:47.174 --> 00:49:48.634
Where is he?

728
00:49:48.717 --> 00:49:51.047
Whoa! Whoa!

729
00:50:16.828 --> 00:50:20.668
- Hold on, <i>chérie</i>. I will save you!
- Oh, dear!

730
00:50:21.249 --> 00:50:24.749
Oh, no. Oh, gosh. Oh, no.
Oh, gosh. Oh, no. Oh, gosh.

731
00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:26.510
Oh, no!

732
00:50:37.599 --> 00:50:42.059
- Oh, Chip, thank goodness you're safe.
- I wasn't scared.

733
00:50:46.191 --> 00:50:47.821
Oh, no! No!

734
00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:14.640
Belle!

735
00:51:26.148 --> 00:51:29.068
Oh, no, what have I done?

736
00:51:29.985 --> 00:51:31.735
It's all my fault.

737
00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:37.240
We all share some blame, <i>mon ami,</i>
for daring to hope for a Christmas.

738
00:51:59.347 --> 00:52:01.807
You said you'd never leave.

739
00:52:06.104 --> 00:52:08.444
I wasn't trying to leave.

740
00:52:10.275 --> 00:52:12.985
I just wanted to make you happy.

741
00:52:15.447 --> 00:52:18.577
You broke your word.

742
00:52:18.658 --> 00:52:24.118
And for that, you will rot
in this dungeon forever.

743
00:52:25.999 --> 00:52:30.549
I should have known
you'd never be anything but a beast.

744
00:52:36.218 --> 00:52:38.048
Midnight.

745
00:52:38.136 --> 00:52:40.596
Merry Christmas, Cogsworth.

746
00:52:41.014 --> 00:52:42.974
If only it were.

747
00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:51.150
Oh, my dear old friend,
I told you not to feel for her.

748
00:52:51.775 --> 00:52:56.395
Things were so much simpler
before she came along,

749
00:52:56.488 --> 00:53:00.488
before we dared to hope.

750
00:53:01.159 --> 00:53:05.369
Oh, I thought she was the one.

751
00:53:07.541 --> 00:53:08.841
Belle?

752
00:53:09.709 --> 00:53:11.629
There she is.

753
00:53:11.711 --> 00:53:16.131
- Merry Christmas.
- Doesn't look so special to me.

754
00:53:16.758 --> 00:53:21.008
Oh, Chip, I'm sorry.

755
00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:23.390
Nothing's changed.

756
00:53:23.473 --> 00:53:26.143
I told you nothing would change.

757
00:53:26.226 --> 00:53:28.186
I told you the master
would not allow this.

758
00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:31.770
I told you Christmas was a hopeless folly!

759
00:53:32.774 --> 00:53:34.114
But

760
00:53:35.443 --> 00:53:36.993
I was wrong.

761
00:53:40.323 --> 00:53:44.331
<i>When I felt lost</i>

762
00:53:44.411 --> 00:53:47.459
<i>And lonely</i>

763
00:53:47.539 --> 00:53:52.879
<i>Not a dream in my head</i>

764
00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:59.050
<i>Your words lifted my spirits</i>

765
00:53:59.134 --> 00:54:01.264
<i>High</i>

766
00:54:01.344 --> 00:54:04.224
<i>Remember what</i>

767
00:54:04.306 --> 00:54:06.726
<i>You said</i>

768
00:54:08.393 --> 00:54:14.611
<i>As long as there's Christmas</i>

769
00:54:14.691 --> 00:54:19.651
<i>I truly believe</i>

770
00:54:20.655 --> 00:54:26.365
<i>That hope is the greatest</i>

771
00:54:26.453 --> 00:54:32.543
<i>Of the gifts we'll receive</i>

772
00:54:33.376 --> 00:54:36.246
<i>- As long as
- As long as</i>

773
00:54:36.338 --> 00:54:40.588
<i>Our guiding star</i>

774
00:54:40.675 --> 00:54:45.305
<i>Shines above</i>

775
00:54:45.388 --> 00:54:49.018
<i>There'll always be</i>

776
00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:55.400
<i>Christmas</i>

777
00:54:55.482 --> 00:54:58.780
<i>So there always</i>

778
00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:02.070
<i>Will be a time</i>

779
00:55:02.155 --> 00:55:07.945
<i>When the world is filled with peace</i>

780
00:55:08.662 --> 00:55:15.342
<i>And love</i>

781
00:55:21.132 --> 00:55:26.302
Ah, it tears me up
to see you this way, master.

782
00:55:26.388 --> 00:55:28.558
Why do you torment yourself?

783
00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:31.640
There's the symbol of your curse.

784
00:55:31.726 --> 00:55:35.436
Destroy it, and end
these adolescent notions

785
00:55:35.522 --> 00:55:38.862
of love and redemption.

786
00:55:38.942 --> 00:55:42.742
End your pain forever.

787
00:55:45.073 --> 00:55:48.453
Yes! Do it!

788
00:55:48.618 --> 00:55:51.038
Smash it!

789
00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:00.510
Belle?

790
00:56:03.633 --> 00:56:06.013
What are you doing? What is it?

791
00:56:11.057 --> 00:56:14.307
Oh, a storybook.

792
00:56:14.394 --> 00:56:17.801
Does this one have pretty pictures
you can color?

793
00:56:18.481 --> 00:56:21.029
Utterly dreadful, master.

794
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:25.989
No! This one's different. It's from Belle.

795
00:56:26.072 --> 00:56:29.579
Well, that would account
for the creative wrapping.

796
00:56:29.659 --> 00:56:31.169
Quiet!

797
00:56:33.538 --> 00:56:35.078
I want to read.

798
00:56:40.503 --> 00:56:44.593
<i>"Once upon a time,
there was an enchanted castle.</i>

799
00:56:44.674 --> 00:56:49.140
<i>"Its master seemed as cold as winter.
Deep inside his heart...</i>

800
00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:52.350
<i>"His cries of anger echoed through
the stone wall of the castle.</i>

801
00:56:52.432 --> 00:56:56.898
<i>"Though surrounded by servants,
he was all alone.</i>

802
00:56:56.978 --> 00:56:59.938
<i>"And in that simple act of kindness,</i>

803
00:57:00.023 --> 00:57:02.570
<i>"he knew someone cared.</i>

804
00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:06.530
<i>"Christmas that year was spent
exchanging humble gifts.</i>

805
00:57:06.613 --> 00:57:09.911
<i>"But the greatest gift
that anyone received</i>

806
00:57:09.991 --> 00:57:12.831
<i>"was the gift of hope."</i>

807
00:57:17.665 --> 00:57:18.995
Hope.

808
00:57:26.758 --> 00:57:28.928
No, master! Come back!

809
00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:31.930
She'll only prolong your torment!

810
00:57:32.388 --> 00:57:37.348
You know what, Belle? I don't need
a tree to celebrate Christmas.

811
00:57:37.435 --> 00:57:40.225
And I can do without mistletoe.

812
00:57:41.314 --> 00:57:44.194
- Well, I don't need tinsel.
- Oh, I don't need holly.

813
00:57:44.275 --> 00:57:46.605
- And I don't need a wreath.
- I don't need ornaments!

814
00:57:46.694 --> 00:57:49.614
- And I don't need turkey!
- I don't need stuffing!

815
00:57:49.697 --> 00:57:52.827
I don't need pudding!

816
00:57:52.909 --> 00:57:56.149
<i>To each his own, my friend
You know how to get me stressed</i>

817
00:57:56.221 --> 00:57:58.791
<i>But when it comes to
making Christmas special...</i>

818
00:57:58.873 --> 00:58:00.462
<i>I'm a cut above the rest</i>

819
00:58:00.542 --> 00:58:03.798
<i>If you could see things clearly
you would say that I've been blessed</i>

820
00:58:03.878 --> 00:58:06.628
<i>You can't hold a candle to my timing</i>

821
00:58:06.714 --> 00:58:09.179
<i>I'm a cut above the rest</i>

822
00:58:09.259 --> 00:58:12.889
<i>You belong side by side
You should never be apart</i>

823
00:58:12.971 --> 00:58:17.228
<i>'Cause when you're both together
you're really twice as smart</i>

824
00:58:17.308 --> 00:58:20.308
"Twice as smart." She does have a point.

825
00:58:20.395 --> 00:58:23.645
Yes, well, two heads are better than one.

826
00:58:23.731 --> 00:58:26.941
<i>They say that as a team
we have got to be the best</i>

827
00:58:27.026 --> 00:58:29.526
<i>Now we found something we both agree on</i>

828
00:58:29.612 --> 00:58:31.159
<i>We're a cut above the rest</i>

829
00:58:31.239 --> 00:58:34.739
<i>There's no doubt that as a team
we two are the very best</i>

830
00:58:34.826 --> 00:58:37.196
<i>Everyone who knows us must agree</i>

831
00:58:37.287 --> 00:58:38.907
<i>We're a cut above the rest</i>

832
00:58:38.997 --> 00:58:42.327
<i>There's no doubt that as a team
you two are the very best</i>

833
00:58:42.417 --> 00:58:44.997
<i>Everyone who knows you must agree</i>

834
00:58:45.086 --> 00:58:47.376
<i>- We're a cut
- A cut above</i>

835
00:58:47.463 --> 00:58:49.133
<i>Above the rest</i>

836
00:58:51.759 --> 00:58:53.889
Uh-oh! It's the master!

837
00:58:54.762 --> 00:58:57.392
Uh, Belle...

838
00:59:07.984 --> 00:59:10.154
Can you forgive me?

839
00:59:17.202 --> 00:59:20.542
Of course. Merry Christmas.

840
00:59:21.039 --> 00:59:22.289
All right!

841
00:59:22.665 --> 00:59:26.085
Let's give Belle the Christmas
she's always wanted.

842
00:59:26.961 --> 00:59:29.341
So, Beast gets girl,

843
00:59:29.422 --> 00:59:32.552
and it's a happy ending for everyone.

844
00:59:33.176 --> 00:59:35.636
Enchantment lifted,

845
00:59:36.304 --> 00:59:39.724
and Forte fades into the background.

846
00:59:40.225 --> 00:59:45.145
No longer important. No longer needed.

847
00:59:45.813 --> 00:59:47.903
I think not!

848
00:59:58.284 --> 01:00:01.082
What is it, Mama? What's happening?

849
01:00:06.626 --> 01:00:08.126
Watch out!

850
01:00:10.046 --> 01:00:11.416
Forte!

851
01:00:14.676 --> 01:00:16.756
- Whoa!
- Hurry, now. Hurry.

852
01:00:18.513 --> 01:00:21.683
Can you believe I never took a lesson?

853
01:00:25.186 --> 01:00:26.516
Belle!

854
01:00:27.397 --> 01:00:28.607
- Oh, no!
- Belle!

855
01:00:28.690 --> 01:00:29.860
Help!

856
01:00:41.077 --> 01:00:42.117
Oh, no.

857
01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:48.040
Maestro! Stop!

858
01:00:49.043 --> 01:00:52.963
- What do you think you're doing?
- Don't you see, Fife?

859
01:00:53.047 --> 01:00:56.337
They can't fall in love if they're dead.

860
01:00:56.426 --> 01:01:00.506
I'll tell you what I see.
A big, old windbag!

861
01:01:01.806 --> 01:01:04.426
You could've joined me, Fife,

862
01:01:04.517 --> 01:01:08.397
but I see my triumph is a solo act.

863
01:01:10.231 --> 01:01:12.691
My solo... It's blank!

864
01:01:13.943 --> 01:01:15.653
So naive.

865
01:01:15.737 --> 01:01:18.317
- No! No, no!
- You're second fiddle, Fife,

866
01:01:18.406 --> 01:01:21.326
and that's all you'll ever be.

867
01:01:21.409 --> 01:01:23.409
Forte!

868
01:01:27.081 --> 01:01:30.251
We can remain as we are forever and ever!

869
01:01:37.759 --> 01:01:39.759
Forte!

870
01:01:45.767 --> 01:01:47.637
Enough!

871
01:01:47.727 --> 01:01:49.767
Heavens! Master.

872
01:01:51.272 --> 01:01:53.572
You're not singing.

873
01:02:04.035 --> 01:02:05.405
Careful.

874
01:02:13.294 --> 01:02:15.341
Oh, no, the bell jar!

875
01:02:15.421 --> 01:02:19.051
- Whoa! Got it. Got it.
- Oh, careful.

876
01:02:19.133 --> 01:02:22.140
Is this happy enough for you, master?

877
01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:26.640
I know I'm downright giddy!

878
01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:31.850
Master, the keyboard.

879
01:02:56.462 --> 01:02:58.592
- You got it?
- Got it. Got it.

880
01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:00.300
Whoa!

881
01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.020
Help!

882
01:03:13.354 --> 01:03:17.154
No!

883
01:03:25.992 --> 01:03:27.372
Forte.

884
01:03:34.459 --> 01:03:37.419
Oh, yes, it is lovely.

885
01:03:37.503 --> 01:03:39.923
And you said it was impossible.

886
01:03:40.047 --> 01:03:41.587
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

887
01:03:41.883 --> 01:03:46.103
I said it was impossible without me.

888
01:03:46.512 --> 01:03:49.642
- Everyone, shh-shh! Here they come.
- Wow!

889
01:03:52.143 --> 01:03:54.193
The setting is perfect.

890
01:03:54.729 --> 01:03:57.059
Oh, aren't they beautiful?

891
01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:04.279
It's wonderful!

892
01:04:04.363 --> 01:04:06.119
Hurray!

893
01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:11.660
And what a wonderful Christmas it was.

894
01:04:11.746 --> 01:04:17.166
I suppose if anyone saved Christmas,
it was Belle.

895
01:04:17.251 --> 01:04:19.590
Merry Christmas, one and all!

896
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:22.670
- Merry Christmas.
- And merry Christmas to you, sir.

897
01:04:22.757 --> 01:04:25.427
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, everyone.

898
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:29.220
I believe we have
a little something for you, Chip.

899
01:04:29.305 --> 01:04:32.345
A present? Oh, boy! Thank you.

900
01:04:32.433 --> 01:04:34.021
Open it!

901
01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:39.360
Look, Mama! A storybook!
Would you read it to me?

902
01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:42.070
- I'd love to, son.
- Oh, boy!

903
01:04:46.447 --> 01:04:48.027
Maestro?

904
01:04:50.201 --> 01:04:53.661
- Yes, master?
- Would you do us the honor, old friend?

905
01:04:54.330 --> 01:04:56.380
I'd be delighted.
