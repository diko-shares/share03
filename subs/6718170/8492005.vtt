1
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.720
Behold! The king of the Koopas!

2
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.200
Open the gates or die!

3
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.920
Attack!

4
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.680
That is but a taste of our fury.

5
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.680
Do you yield?

6
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.800
I do not.

7
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.040
No.

8
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.640
I've finally found it.

9
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.160
And now, no one can stop me!

10
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.760
It's-a me, a-Mario!

11
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.840
And-a Luigi!

12
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.240
Are you-a tired of a-paying
too much for plumbing?

13
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.680
Mamma mia!

14
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.920
That's a-why
the Super Mario Brothers are here.

15
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.880
- A-to save Brooklyn.
- And-a Queens.

16
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.120
And-a your wallet.

17
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.760
Thank you, Super Mario Bros.

18
00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.960
It seems like the only thing

19
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.040
you haven't drained

20
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.120
is my bank account.

21
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.400
Forget-a the expensive
a-plumbing companies

22
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.960
a-where you're just a face-a.

23
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.520
With-a Super Mario Brothers-a,
you're family.

24
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.200
Wow. You were great.

25
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.280
I was great? Are you kidding me?
You were great!

26
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.640
I am so glad we spent our life
savings on this commercial.

27
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.040
That is not a commercial!
That is cinema.

28
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.800
What about the accents?
Is it... Is it too much?

29
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.240
Too much? It's-a perfect.

30
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.880
Okay, I'm gonna trust you.

31
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.480
Well, well, well.

32
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.200
If it isn't
Brooklyn's favorite failures

33
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.080
the Stupid Mario Brothers.

34
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.800
Aw, great. Spike's here.

35
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.080
Hey, Spike.

36
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.760
Yeah. "It's-a me!"

37
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.800
Yeah.

38
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.160
Tell me,
have you even gotten one call

39
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.520
since you left me
to start your dumb company?

40
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.800
As a matter of fact,
Spike, we have.

41
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.880
Wow. Really?

42
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.920
Yeah. Our mom called

43
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.520
and she said, "Oh, boys, that's
the best commercial I've ever seen!"

44
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.320
And I said, "Thank you very much,
Mother. We're very proud of it."

45
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.400
So, boom!

46
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.720
Good luck running
a business with this idiot.

47
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.040
Say that again about my brother,
and you're gonna regret it.

48
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.120
Oh, yeah?

49
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.120
Get this through
your tiny brain, Mario.

50
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.400
You're a joke,
and you always will be.

51
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.400
Are you insane?

52
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.200
He's three times your size.

53
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.520
Luigi, come on.

54
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.360
You know,
you can't be scared all the time.

55
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.880
You'd be surprised.

56
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.760
Hello, Super Mario Brothers.

57
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.720
A drip in your faucet? That's great!

58
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.840
I mean, that's great you called us

59
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.400
because we can be there
and we can fix it right away. Okay.

60
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.120
Mario, we got one!

61
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.680
The Super Mario Brothers
are in business!

62
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.640
Oh, no. We're gonna be late.

63
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.680
No, we're not. Come on. Let's go.

64
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.080
Hey, wait up.

65
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.400
This way.

66
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.360
Come on, Lu. Step on it.

67
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.480
Excuse you.

68
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:29.960
Here you go!

69
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.880
Mario. What're you doin'?

70
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.400
Hey! Get off of there!

71
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.880
You can't be in...

72
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.320
My bad!

73
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.640
- Move it up!
- I'm...

74
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.280
- We're working here!
- Sorry. So sorry.

75
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.360
Come on, Luigi. Pump those legs.

76
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.280
I'm trying. I'm trying.

77
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.360
I got bad knees.

78
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.960
Oh, wow. We have hit the big time.

79
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.120
The drip is right upstairs
at the end of the hall.

80
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.000
- Can you fix it?
- Very confident, sir.

81
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.920
You'll be careful
about making a mess?

82
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.280
Ma'am, I assure you,
we don't make messes.

83
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.360
We fix 'em.

84
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.720
That's Francis.

85
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.040
He likes you!

86
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.160
Mama... mama love ya, baby.

87
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.040
Wrench?

88
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.080
And a first job complete.

89
00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.440
- Hey!
- Hey!

90
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.160
Francis is here.

91
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.680
Hey there, pal.

92
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.040
Mario! Do something!

93
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.000
Mamma mia!

94
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.280
Mario?

95
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.280
That hellhound is gonna escape!

96
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.200
No, he won't.

97
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.000
Hey, Mario?

98
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.960
Who's a good puppy?

99
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.520
Who's a good boy?

100
00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.880
Found the problem!

101
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.800
- Ma, you make these?
- Good batch, hey?

102
00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.640
Hey-o!

103
00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.920
Hey-o!

104
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.520
It's the Super Mario Brothers,
from the TV!

105
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.600
They give an Oscar for worst actors?

106
00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.160
- Hey!
- What'd I do?

107
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.120
So... So everybody saw
the commercial then?

108
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.800
We seen it.

109
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.880
- And?
- I wouldn't quit your day job.

110
00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.760
Oops! He already did.

111
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.880
Well, I thought it was incredible.

112
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.680
It belongs in a movie theater.

113
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.280
Mushrooms?

114
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.200
Everybody loves mushrooms, right?

115
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.880
- I like mushrooms. I'll take it.
- Yeah.

116
00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.200
Mario, seriously.

117
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.200
What were you thinking
with that commercial?

118
00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.840
What? It's supposed to be funny.

119
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.496
- Can someone pass the bread?
- Yeah, but what's with the outfits?

120
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.200
Plumbers wearing white gloves?

121
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.680
That's right, you gotta have
a trademark. Gotta stand out.

122
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.040
Don't listen to them.

123
00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.360
The world laughed at da Vinci too.

124
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.200
I'm not sure they did, Ma.

125
00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.040
Dad, what did you think?

126
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.360
I think you're nuts.

127
00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.560
You don't leave a steady job
for some crazy dream.

128
00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.960
And the worst part?

129
00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.320
You're bringing
your brother down with you.

130
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.040
Well, thanks, Dad.

131
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.200
Thanks for your support.

132
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.320
What'd I say?

133
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.040
<i>Thanks for tuning in
to News Channel 4.</i>

134
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.120
Hey.

135
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.520
You're not bringing me down.

136
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:27.920
You know what?

137
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.160
What do they know, huh?

138
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.680
It's not just them.

139
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.376
Our whole lives,
everyone's telling us

140
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.160
we can't do this, we can't do that.

141
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.280
I'm sick and tired
of feeling so small.

142
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.200
<i>A water main burst underground today</i>

143
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.120
<i>stopping subway service
and flooding downtown Brooklyn.</i>

144
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.280
<i>Everything is under control,
I promise you.</i>

145
00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.000
<i>We are very close to fixing this.</i>

146
00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.560
<i>Out of the way!</i>

147
00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.000
<i>Somebody help!
Somebody save Brooklyn!</i>

148
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.840
Save Brooklyn?

149
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.240
Luigi, this is our chance.

150
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.800
Destiny is calling.

151
00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.840
Destiny Del Vecchio,
from high school?

152
00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.240
What? No! Just come on.

153
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.240
Look for a gate valve, huh?

154
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.680
It's more than
the storm drains can handle.

155
00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.160
Come on. We gotta pump it.

156
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.680
I got this.

157
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.360
They're not even looking
in the right place.

158
00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.680
Come on, Lu.

159
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.160
You are not seriously considering...

160
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.000
Mario!

161
00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.680
We gotta get to that pressure valve.

162
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.480
Mamma mia!

163
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.200
Mario!

164
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.200
I knew saving Brooklyn
was a bad idea.

165
00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.600
Come on.

166
00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.760
Whoa.

167
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.720
What is this place?

168
00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.520
Looks like nobody's been
down here for years.

169
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.320
Luigi?

170
00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.120
Luigi, are you in there?

171
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.320
Luigi?

172
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.400
What?

173
00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.000
Whoa!

174
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.720
Luigi!

175
00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.800
Mario!

176
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.800
Give me your hand!

177
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.960
It's all gonna be okay.

178
00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.600
How is this gonna be okay?

179
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.840
I'm telling you, nothing can hurt us
as long as we're together.

180
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.320
Mario!

181
00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.760
Luigi!

182
00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.000
Do not touch that mushroom!
You'll die!

183
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.320
Oh, I'm sorry.

184
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.680
That one's perfectly fine.

185
00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.000
That's a little mushroom man.
A little mushroom man talking to me.

186
00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.160
Pleased to meet ya. I'm Toad.

187
00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:11.880
Mario.

188
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.160
So, this is... This is...
This is not a dream?

189
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.880
- That hurt, right?
- Yes!

190
00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.040
Definitely not a dream.

191
00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.400
Then it's... This place is...

192
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.200
The Mushroom Kingdom!

193
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.960
Mushrooms. Really?

194
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.720
Now, that is a cruel twist of fate.

195
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.520
Hello.

196
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.040
Yeah, I'm actually looking
for somebody. My brother, in fact.

197
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.000
He looks exactly like me,
but tall and skinny and green.

198
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.536
See, last time I saw him,
he was falling through a pipe.

199
00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.600
It was foggy,
and I believe there was lava.

200
00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.920
That is not good.

201
00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.520
Your brother has landed
in the Dark Lands.

202
00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.240
They're under... Bowser's control.

203
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.040
Bowser?

204
00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.360
He's the most evil,
wretched creature alive.

205
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.720
I'm taking you to see the princess.

206
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.200
She can help you.

207
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.520
She can do anything.

208
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.200
Princess?

209
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.600
Come on, Mario!
Our big adventure begins now!

210
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.040
Hang on, Luigi.

211
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.160
Mario?

212
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.000
Mario?

213
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.400
Where are you?

214
00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.280
Huh?

215
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.760
Yes!

216
00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.360
You just got a-Luigi'd.

217
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:57.040
This way, Mario. The princess
lives right on that hill.

218
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.560
Do you wanna go or not?

219
00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.360
Excuse me, everybody.
Coming through!

220
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.360
Got a big adventure happening
right now. Just clear a path for us.

221
00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.696
- If I could just...
- Here you go.

222
00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.720
Excuse me.

223
00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.160
Excuse me, everybody.
Coming through.

224
00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.440
This guy's brother
is going to die imminently.

225
00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.696
- What?
- Out of the way, please.

226
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.256
Just trying to clear a path.
That's all I'm doing.

227
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.280
He's gonna be fine.

228
00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.560
- Chanterelle!
- Morning!

229
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.360
- Nice to see you, bud!
- Hi.

230
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.600
Does this thing work?

231
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.760
Yes, works great.
You just have to blow into it.

232
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.320
And up we go!

233
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.400
Wait, up?

234
00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.120
Okay, so these bricks are
just floating here?

235
00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.840
Just pop in this pipe
and we're on our way.

236
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.640
It's the only way to fly, man!

237
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.400
Oh, wow. Love these pi...

238
00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.120
Huh?

239
00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.400
Oh, come on!

240
00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.360
Here we are. Palace doors.
Bing, bang, boom!

241
00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.280
Come on!

242
00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.600
Pretty impressive, am I right?

243
00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.040
Hold it right there, you two!

244
00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.920
Oh, hey! I need to see the princess.

245
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.040
It's an emergency.

246
00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.320
What princess?

247
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.200
I never heard of any princess.

248
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.400
Oh, wait, I did. Our princess,
though, is in another castle.

249
00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.800
Oh, yeah. That's right.

250
00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.880
You should try another castle, maybe.
She ain't in this one.

251
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.760
- Huh?
- Okay, so they're messing with you

252
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.760
and I don't like it.

253
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.880
What do you guys...
What do you wanna eat?

254
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.840
Anything... Anything
your hearts desire.

255
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.200
Go. I am ready to scramble it up.

256
00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.760
Hey! Intruder!

257
00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:38.840
Stop him!

258
00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.360
Intruder!

259
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.120
Stop him!

260
00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.520
Now! Stop him!

261
00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.600
Council, your attention.

262
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:04.960
Bowser has found the Super Star
and is headed toward our kingdom.

263
00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.640
Its power will make him invincible.

264
00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.800
We will be destroyed.

265
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.840
Princess, what are we gonna do?

266
00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.520
I will not let him hurt you.

267
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.520
We are going to stop Bowser.

268
00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.680
How? Look at us. We're adorable!

269
00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.640
I'm going to convince
the great Kong army to help us.

270
00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.440
Together, we'll annihilate
that monster.

271
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.040
Their mad king
doesn't make alliances.

272
00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.280
The Kongs will never agree.

273
00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.200
I can convince him.

274
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.280
I'll leave for the Jungle Kingdom
in the morning.

275
00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.320
Good luck, Princess.

276
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.040
For all our sakes.

277
00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.960
Princess!

278
00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.360
Princess! I...

279
00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.800
Wait. Release him.

280
00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:16.560
Are you...

281
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.160
No.

282
00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.480
He's a human!
I mean, you are a human, right?

283
00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.960
- It's just, you're so small, and...
- Hey!

284
00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.480
Wait... Let's go back.
Where did you come from?

285
00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:30.320
Me and my little brother, Luigi,
we fell down this pipe.

286
00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.080
And now he's lost
somewhere in the Dark Lands.

287
00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.800
Then it's only a matter of time
until he's captured by Bowser.

288
00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.880
But you're in luck.
I'm on my way to stop him.

289
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.240
Well, take me with you.

290
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.320
This guy's a lunatic. A psycho.

291
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.400
He will eat you for breakfast.

292
00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:51.080
He won't even notice it, probably,
'cause you're very, very small.

293
00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.040
You know what?
Make fun of me all you want

294
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.760
but you are gonna
help me find my brother.

295
00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.440
Please?

296
00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:59.960
Well, okay.

297
00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.480
Let's see what you're made of.

298
00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.160
Is that a "yes"?

299
00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.000
No. That's a
"let's see what you're made of."

300
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.360
If you can finish this,
you're coming with me.

301
00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.640
Watch and learn.

302
00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.720
That was amazing.

303
00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.200
Wait. How am I supposed to do that?

304
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:47.560
With the Power-Ups.
They give us special abilities.

305
00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.040
Really?

306
00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.400
Go on. Eat it.

307
00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:59.920
Now, this has to be a mushroom?

308
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
'Cause I just hate mushrooms and...

309
00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.240
Okay...

310
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.336
- Are you sure there's not a...
- Down the hatch.

311
00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.400
Yep, there it is. And all gone.

312
00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.000
Not cool.

313
00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.600
Huh?

314
00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.320
- I'm tall.
- And strong.

315
00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.520
And you can jump.

316
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.360
I got this. No problem.

317
00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.680
Oh, no!

318
00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:50.880
Oh, yeah.

319
00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.160
When you get hit,
you lose the power.

320
00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.360
Great.

321
00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.120
Come on. Try again.

322
00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.400
Yes!

323
00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:15.000
Well, we have a long journey
ahead of us, Mustache.

324
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.680
But I didn't make it.

325
00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.600
You almost did.
No one gets it right away.

326
00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.320
How many tries did it take you?

327
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.480
Oh, so many. I was not good at it.

328
00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:26.800
Worse than you.

329
00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.776
You got it right away, didn't you?

330
00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.000
I got it right away,
but I grew up here.

331
00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.320
Okay, now you're just trying
to make me feel better.

332
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.320
No! No.

333
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Is it working?

334
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.280
A little bit. Yeah.

335
00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.720
My army!

336
00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.560
- Koopas,
- Yeah!

337
00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.800
Goombas

338
00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.600
whatever those things are!

339
00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:19.920
After years of searching for
the Super Star, it is finally ours.

340
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.640
- Yeah!
- I am now

341
00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.800
the most powerful turtle
in the world.

342
00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:24.880
Yeah!

343
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.440
Soon, we will arrive
at the Mushroom Kingdom.

344
00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.520
Yeah!

345
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.240
Where, after years
of being sworn enemies

346
00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:35.480
I will ask their princess to marry me
in a fairy-tale wedding!

347
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:36.800
Yeah!

348
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.560
Eh?

349
00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.320
Yeah.

350
00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.240
Did he say marry their princess?

351
00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.960
Doesn't she hate you?

352
00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.600
Of course she hates me.

353
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.200
But that makes me
love her all the more.

354
00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.600
Her heart-shaped bangs,
the way she floats in the breeze

355
00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.760
her immovable tiara.

356
00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.080
And when she sees this star...

357
00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.640
Wedding bells.

358
00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.680
What if she says no?

359
00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:08.040
Then I will power up with this star
and destroy the Mushroom Kingdom!

360
00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.080
- Yeah!
- Prepare yourselves

361
00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.760
for the best wedding ever!

362
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.880
It's gonna rock!

363
00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.920
They're all counting on us.

364
00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.400
No pressure.

365
00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:25.760
Yay!

366
00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.120
- Yeah!
- Hooray!

367
00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.320
Huh?

368
00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:34.840
Good luck!

369
00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:37.520
My Toads

370
00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.240
our days of terror are almost over.

371
00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:44.120
With the help of the Kong army,
we will stop...

372
00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.960
Who's he?

373
00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.360
He's not important!

374
00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.360
Nervous?

375
00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.520
Who? Me?

376
00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:10.640
Yes, a little.

377
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.400
<i>We're going on an adventure</i>

378
00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:14.480
Come on, guys!

379
00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:18.640
Hey, Mario.

380
00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:19.880
You know this guy?

381
00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:20.960
We're best friends.

382
00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.080
But are we?

383
00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:27.080
Don't worry. I will protect you.

384
00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:30.200
A Toad brave enough to join me.

385
00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.960
I fear nothing.

386
00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.080
Well, that settles it.
You're coming with us.

387
00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.160
Let's move.

388
00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:39.520
<i>I said we're going on an adventure</i>

389
00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.880
Pretty incredible, huh?

390
00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.000
Mamma mia.

391
00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.480
I'll never let anyone ruin this.

392
00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:03.920
Sire.

393
00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:06.600
What?

394
00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.120
A report from our intelligence.

395
00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:13.160
A mustachioed human has arrived
in the Mushroom Kingdom.

396
00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.960
The princess has been training him.

397
00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.040
They are up to something, sire.

398
00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.040
Sit.

399
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.000
Jam with me.

400
00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:32.480
This human, where did he come from?

401
00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.600
We aren't sure.

402
00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.320
Does the princess like him?

403
00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.920
Sire. Look in the mirror.

404
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.240
You have nothing to worry about.

405
00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.480
I know that. I'm not threatened.

406
00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:50.120
Find out who he is
and what they're planning!

407
00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.760
I'm on it, sire.

408
00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.200
May I lift the cover?

409
00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.200
Not yet. Pain is the best teacher.

410
00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.240
Thinking about your brother?

411
00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.360
We've never been apart this long.

412
00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.240
Don't worry. We're going to save him.

413
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.360
You don't seem like you're from here.

414
00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.800
I don't know where I'm from.

415
00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.920
- Really?
- Yep.

416
00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:40.680
My earliest memory is arriving.

417
00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.920
I was so lucky they found me.

418
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.800
They took me in.

419
00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.320
Raised me like one of their own.

420
00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.520
And when I was ready...

421
00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.880
they made me their princess.

422
00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.640
Hey, maybe you're from my world.

423
00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:11.680
There's a huge universe out there

424
00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.000
with a lot of galaxies.

425
00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.800
We found him in the Dark Lands.

426
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.240
Leave him to me.

427
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.520
What is your name?

428
00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.880
Luigi.

429
00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.160
Not sure if you know who I am

430
00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:24.560
but I'm about to marry a princess
and rule the world.

431
00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.200
Wow...

432
00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.200
Yay.

433
00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.280
But there's one problem, Luigi.

434
00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:34.600
There's a human
traveling with my fiancée.

435
00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:35.880
Has a mustache.

436
00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.560
Just like you.

437
00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.960
Do you know him?

438
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.200
No. No!

439
00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.200
Ah, a tough one, I see.

440
00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.360
Maybe this will get you to talk.

441
00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.136
Do you think I know
every human being with a mustache

442
00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.400
wearing an identical outfit

443
00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.720
with a hat with
the letter of his first name on it?

444
00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.040
Because I don't.

445
00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.240
Do you know him?

446
00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.360
Stop... I know him.
Yes, I know him.

447
00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:03.040
Yeah, he's my brother, Mario,
and he's the best guy in the world.

448
00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.880
Do princesses find him attractive?

449
00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.200
They do if they have good taste.

450
00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.480
Get him out of my sight.

451
00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:15.880
We'll see how tough this Mario is
when he watches me kill his brother.

452
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.760
Where am I?

453
00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:34.840
Home.

454
00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.720
Pay him no heed.

455
00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.960
He is cute, but he is...

456
00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:44.760
In an insane world,
it is the sane who is called crazy.

457
00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.800
How long you guys been in here?

458
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:54.280
Time, like hope, is an illusion.

459
00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.360
Please. We are depressed enough.

460
00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.480
There's gotta be a way outta here.

461
00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.080
There is no escape.

462
00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:04.000
The only hope is
the sweet relief of death.

463
00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.800
You've got to be kidding me.

464
00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.120
You ready?

465
00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:32.880
Sure?

466
00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.120
What?

467
00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.000
How you doing?

468
00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.520
We are here to see the king.

469
00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.440
Follow me.

470
00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.256
That gorilla's wearing a sports coat.

471
00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.320
Feel underdressed.

472
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Hop in.

473
00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:13.680
Oh, by all means, come in.

474
00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:27.200
Great and mighty Cranky Kong...

475
00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.000
So I heard you want my army.

476
00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.600
Yes, Your Highness.

477
00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:33.680
Without your help

478
00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:36.240
the Mushroom Kingdom
will be annihilated.

479
00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.960
What makes you think

480
00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:45.480
you're worthy of fighting alongside
the greatest army in the world?

481
00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.120
Because we have heart.

482
00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:51.320
And with your strength, we can win.

483
00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:53.120
Okay, fine.

484
00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.280
- That's it?
- No, that's not it.

485
00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.920
The answer is no. Goodbye.

486
00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:01.440
If the Mushroom Kingdom falls,
the Jungle Kingdom is next.

487
00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.800
We're not leaving without your army.

488
00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.240
Who is this guy?

489
00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:10.800
Oh, he makes me laugh.

490
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.320
All right, tough guy.

491
00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.040
You want my army so badly

492
00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:22.480
defeat my son
in the Great Ring of Kong!

493
00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:24.880
Give us a second.

494
00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.960
This is a really, really bad idea.

495
00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.960
Well, do you have another way
to save my brother?

496
00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.160
Are you two done whispering?

497
00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.800
It's a little rude.

498
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.640
You, sir, have a deal.

499
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:40.280
I'll fight your son and win.

500
00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:42.000
I'm sure you will.

501
00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.400
I am DK.

502
00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.480
I'm Donkey Kong.

503
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.240
Oh, yeah!

504
00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:39.000
- Hi, Dad! Hi!
- No, don't.

505
00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:40.160
Don't do that.

506
00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.520
Dad, wave back.

507
00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.720
Enough with the showboating.

508
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.720
What do you mean? They like it.

509
00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.160
It's what they came here for.

510
00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.560
Dancing pecs.

511
00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.200
Okay, simmer down.

512
00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.400
DK...!

513
00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.680
I said simmer down!

514
00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.200
DK...!

515
00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.640
That means you, Diddy Kong!

516
00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.240
D... Sorry.

517
00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:03.640
Now, since I want this fight to last
more than five seconds

518
00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:06.400
I put Power-Ups around the arena.

519
00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.600
You're welcome, Mario.

520
00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:13.440
I don't need anything special to
break every bone in your tiny body!

521
00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:22.320
All right.

522
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:27.640
Get him!

523
00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:35.960
Oh! My... Okay.

524
00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:37.880
Guess you're not getting my army.

525
00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.200
Is this what you came for?

526
00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:47.000
We love you, DK!

527
00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:50.840
Hi, Dad! Love you!

528
00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:59.400
It is on like Donkey Kong!

529
00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.360
You're about to pick
on someone your own size.

530
00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.160
Yeah!

531
00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.600
I guess he got the wrong mushroom.

532
00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:47.040
Get up, Mario!

533
00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:14.280
Had enough?

534
00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:17.480
Not even close.

535
00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.440
Mario!

536
00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:33.160
It's-a me.

537
00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:35.600
The box!

538
00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.360
He looks adorable.

539
00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:55.800
He really does.

540
00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.920
Oh, what? I'm a cat?

541
00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:00.360
You got the cat box!

542
00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:02.040
Oh, my...

543
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.640
I'm sorry... Okay.

544
00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:07.080
Now you die.

545
00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.360
I'm a cat.

546
00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.800
Meow.

547
00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:51.920
Had enough?

548
00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:55.880
Not even close.

549
00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:59.560
I'll take that as a yes.

550
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.360
Mario...!

551
00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.840
Yes! That's my best friend!

552
00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:13.520
Mario...!

553
00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.560
Yeah...

554
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.200
Mario...!

555
00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:21.160
That was incredible.

556
00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.320
- He kept beating you senseless...
- Hey.

557
00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:25.360
And you just kept getting back up?

558
00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.520
You just don't know when to quit.

559
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.040
Well, never thought of that
as a good thing.

560
00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.920
It's a great thing.

561
00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:33.520
Thanks. I...

562
00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.200
I let him win. Just for the record.

563
00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.880
Really, though?
Why would you do that?

564
00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:39.240
You wanna know why?

565
00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:41.640
It's mind your own business,
that's why.

566
00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.400
- All right, giant monkey...
- Enough!

567
00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:46.080
Get inside.

568
00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.200
We've located Bowser's ship.

569
00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:54.200
He's gonna arrive
at the Mushroom Kingdom by sundown.

570
00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.600
Lucky for you guys, I got a shortcut.

571
00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:00.200
We beat him there and ambush him.

572
00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.520
Yeah, I know.

573
00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:06.280
That's why we're gonna need karts!

574
00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.520
Well, what are you waiting for?

575
00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:27.120
Pick your karts.

576
00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:26.520
I hate you.

577
00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:30.920
To the Mushroom Kingdom
and the biggest fight of our lives.

578
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.400
Here we go!

579
00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:36.800
Yeah!

580
00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:53.320
Princess Peach, here we are.

581
00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:57.280
I guess love really makes a guy
come out of his shell.

582
00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.920
Let's rule the world.

583
00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.360
Together. Forever.

584
00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:07.400
Will you marry me?

585
00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.240
Oh, yes!

586
00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:12.640
What?

587
00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:15.680
We have found the princess
and the mustachioed human.

588
00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:19.800
He has defeated Donkey Kong
and won the Kong army.

589
00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.680
So, like, Peach was super impressed?

590
00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.520
It appears so, yes.

591
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.680
They are heading
toward their secret passage.

592
00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:28.280
Oh, they think
they can surprise me, huh?

593
00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:30.040
Two can play at that game.

594
00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:55.640
No one panic,
but the road is about to end.

595
00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:59.200
Well, then you better step on the gas
and buckle up.

596
00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:31.840
Is there anything like this
in your world?

597
00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:32.920
What?

598
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.120
Is there anything
like this in your world?

599
00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:38.080
No.

600
00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.960
We don't drive on rainbows.

601
00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:43.280
What are you gonna tell me next?
That the turtles aren't evil?

602
00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:45.680
No, no. They're usually pets.

603
00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:46.840
No way.

604
00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.760
Eh, come to Brooklyn.
I'll buy you a turtle.

605
00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.400
Maybe I will.

606
00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:55.000
Dude, is this you flirting?
This is painful.

607
00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:56.400
Just... I was trying to be nice.

608
00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.000
You are so embarrassing.

609
00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:00.280
A princess would
never go out with you.

610
00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:02.320
Yes, she would.
I guarantee she would.

611
00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.120
Guys, enough.

612
00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:05.800
All right...

613
00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:15.800
Attack!

614
00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:26.120
It's an ambush!

615
00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:30.800
Defensive positions!

616
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.320
Mario, you're a dead man.

617
00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:52.920
Split up!

618
00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:56.240
Mario!

619
00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:12.000
I'm too cute to die!

620
00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:23.680
That is how you princess!

621
00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:37.000
Time to die, Mario.

622
00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.080
See ya!

623
00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.480
No!

624
00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:06.960
Yeah!

625
00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:16.680
You can't escape me!

626
00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:17.880
What?

627
00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:20.240
Blue shell!

628
00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:35.520
No!

629
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.440
No, Mario!

630
00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:42.200
No...!

631
00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:50.200
Get your clown claws off of me!

632
00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:54.960
Goodbye, Mario.

633
00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:57.160
We have to get home.

634
00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:06.360
Hey! This is your fault!

635
00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:08.560
- My fault? You're the one who...
- Stop talking!

636
00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:12.120
I don't want the last thing
I hear before I die to be your...

637
00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:44.240
Mario, you saved my life.

638
00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:46.440
Yeah, well, I won't tell anyone.

639
00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:47.800
Good. Please don't.

640
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.000
Okay.

641
00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:53.400
Did you just feel something?

642
00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:57.200
Swim!

643
01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:16.600
Bowser's on his way.
You have to evacuate.

644
01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.320
Hurry! Get out of the city!

645
01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.360
Princess?

646
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.400
We lost the army.

647
01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.040
And Mario's gone.

648
01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.720
Bowser is coming.

649
01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.680
Head into the forest.
I'll buy you some time.

650
01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:48.000
You heard her. Evacuate the city.

651
01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.400
Go with the others.

652
01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:53.800
I said I wouldn't
let anyone hurt you.

653
01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.440
Run!

654
01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.000
Run!

655
01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.520
Just leave it! There's no time!

656
01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.120
Princess Peach.

657
01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:01.800
Brave as ever.

658
01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:08.000
As you can see,
I have the Super Star.

659
01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:11.560
If you're going to use it,
use it now.

660
01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:18.440
No, Princess.
I stole this star for us.

661
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.320
I guess love really makes a guy
come out of his shell.

662
01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.840
I told you that line wouldn't work.

663
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.360
You're doing great.

664
01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:33.400
Peaches, with this star,
we will be invincible.

665
01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:36.960
We can rule the world
together. Forever.

666
01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.240
Will you marry me?

667
01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:42.280
Marry you? Are you insane?

668
01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.400
I would never marry you.

669
01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:47.280
Maybe you should reconsider.

670
01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:50.960
No!

671
01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:52.720
Stop!

672
01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:55.160
Please, stop.

673
01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:58.000
I'll... I'll marry you.
Just don't hurt my Toads.

674
01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.480
You have my word.

675
01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.080
Time for a wedding!

676
01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:28.040
<i>Life is sad</i>

677
01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.680
<i>Prison is sad</i>

678
01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:34.640
<i>Life in prison is very, very sad</i>

679
01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:43.400
Ooh, fresh meat for the grinder.

680
01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:45.800
Who's this ray of sunshine?

681
01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:48.760
There's no sunshine. Only darkness.

682
01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.680
Shut up...!

683
01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.120
Hello, prisoners.

684
01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:57.720
You don't deserve this, but
you're invited to the royal wedding!

685
01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.320
Yay!

686
01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:02.600
Where you will all be
ritualistically sacrificed!

687
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.240
Oh, no...!

688
01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:09.840
Finally. Mercy.

689
01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.120
Mario.

690
01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.640
So, this is the end.

691
01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:30.240
Being slowly digested by an eel,
next to an idiot in overalls.

692
01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.920
Well, at least your brother
isn't gonna die because of you.

693
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.640
At least you're not gonna die
with your dad thinking you're a joke.

694
01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:38.320
Yeah, well,
my dad thinks I'm a joke too.

695
01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.000
Yeah, well

696
01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.320
your dad's right!

697
01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:43.040
You know what? I feel bad enough.

698
01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.320
Just leave me alone.

699
01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.680
I've never met your dad,
but he sounds brilliant.

700
01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:49.800
Just go in a corner
and smash some stuff, smash monkey.

701
01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:56.960
I am more
than a guy who smashes things!

702
01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:24.880
That was amazing.

703
01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.040
Now we're even!

704
01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:56.320
Princess, I got it.

705
01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.720
Great job.

706
01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:59.960
Couldn't have you going out there
without your bouquet.

707
01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:01.800
It's perfect.

708
01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.920
I'll be sacrificing them
in your honor.

709
01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.840
Lower the prisoners!

710
01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.520
Dearly belove...

711
01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:43.680
Huh?

712
01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.760
Drama.

713
01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.080
You really thought I'd marry you?

714
01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:52.000
- Kinda.
- I'd never marry a monster.

715
01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:56.520
Then we are breaking up right now!

716
01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.000
Yeah!

717
01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.080
They gotta be up there.

718
01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:26.120
Fire!

719
01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:35.360
You wanna do this?

720
01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:36.440
Yes, I do.

721
01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:47.520
Yes! Fire!

722
01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:04.680
This is fun!

723
01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:07.720
Loser.

724
01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:13.280
Hey, what does this do?

725
01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.480
Whoa. Yeah!

726
01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:23.760
Cool raccoon suit.

727
01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.440
- Really?
- Not at all.

728
01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.040
What?

729
01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.360
Boo.

730
01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:27.320
- Lu!
- Mario?

731
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.280
I told ya. See?

732
01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:35.920
As long as we're together,
everything is gonna be okay.

733
01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:40.960
Mario, why do you look like a bear?
What is this?

734
01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:46.480
Ya did good, kid.

735
01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.000
Make your pecs dance. You deserve it.

736
01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.280
No time now. Definitely later.

737
01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:08.200
Launch the Bomber Bill
and destroy the Mushroom Kingdom!

738
01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:19.840
No.

739
01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.680
Hey... over here.

740
01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:41.880
You asked for it.

741
01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:51.720
Hello.

742
01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:15.560
Really?

743
01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.640
Follow me.

744
01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.200
Come on.

745
01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.240
Little closer.

746
01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:36.760
Mamma mia.

747
01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:47.960
Huh?

748
01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:15.680
- That's beautiful.
- You made these, right?

749
01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:42.680
Brooklyn?

750
01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:45.240
Mario?

751
01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.440
You almost dented my...

752
01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:20.240
Mario!

753
01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.360
You want this?

754
01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.920
You ruined my wedding!

755
01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:42.760
I was finally gonna be happy!

756
01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.560
Now you will suffer!

757
01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:49.680
Like me!

758
01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.960
You really thought you could stop me?

759
01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:10.040
You worthless, weak little nothing.

760
01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.040
Come out and fight.

761
01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:13.880
Or are you too scared?

762
01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:19.840
Just what I thought.

763
01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:39.200
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

764
01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:42.160
<i>That's a-why
the Super Mario Brothers are here.</i>

765
01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:45.400
<i>a-to save Brooklyn.
save Brooklyn... Brooklyn.</i>

766
01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.600
<i>save Brooklyn.</i>

767
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.320
Let's-a go.

768
01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:11.960
Hey.

769
01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.200
Leave him alone.

770
01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:16.120
Mario?

771
01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:19.480
You just don't know when to quit.

772
01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:22.280
Yeah. I've been told that before.

773
01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:26.880
Mario!

774
01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:30.880
The star!

775
01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.760
No! That's mine!

776
01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:54.400
Lu.

777
01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:59.040
"Nothing can hurt us
as long as we're together."

778
01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:10.440
No!

779
01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:24.840
Huh?

780
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.560
Rip them to pieces!

781
01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.560
Oh, hey, Spike.

782
01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:47.080
Luigi?

783
01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.680
No!

784
01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:05.560
Mamma mia!

785
01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:55.760
Peaches.

786
01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:58.920
Listen. This is not
the way I pictured it

787
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.480
but give me one more chance.

788
01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:02.200
Ew. No.

789
01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.480
No...

790
01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:06.680
Hey...!

791
01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:08.480
That is not cool.

792
01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.560
He got the blue mushroom.

793
01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:12.800
Eh? I told you
I'd get you a pet turtle.

794
01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:15.680
Not bad, Mustache.

795
01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:18.680
And, Luigi, you're so brave.

796
01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:21.520
Oh. Thanks...
Yeah, it's kinda my thing.

797
01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:23.200
My boys.

798
01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.920
My heroes.

799
01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:28.360
Mario, you were amazing.

800
01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:30.800
Thanks, Dad.

801
01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:33.160
Bring it in!

802
01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:39.720
Yeah!

803
01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:44.000
Let's hear it
for the Super Mario Brothers!

804
01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:54.520
These are my boys!

805
01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:55.800
Hey.

806
01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:03.560
Yes!

807
01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:00.840
Now, that's a happy ending.

808
01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:02.160
Or is it?

809
01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:04.160
Because everything's over now

810
01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:07.680
and all that's left
is you and the infinite void.

811
01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:11.480
Kind of makes you
want to play saxophone, huh?
