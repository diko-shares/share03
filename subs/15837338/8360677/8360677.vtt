J&H Scrap.
You bring us trash,

9
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.089
Oh, sure thing.
I'll get him.

10
00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:05.592
Hank! Phone!

11
00:02:07.028 --> 00:02:08.829
Okey-doke.

12
00:02:08.863 --> 00:02:11.332
Bruce, when are you gonna
start answering the phone?

13
00:02:11.365 --> 00:02:14.068
Living here
rent-free.

14
00:02:15.036 --> 00:02:16.837
Yell-o. Hello?

15
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.873
Weird.
There's nobody there.

16
00:02:18.906 --> 00:02:21.042
What do you mean?
I was just talking
to her.

17
00:02:21.075 --> 00:02:24.778
Hello? Hello?
What on earth?

18
00:02:27.248 --> 00:02:29.116
The door's locked.

19
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.085
There's
somebody
outside.

20
00:02:31.118 --> 00:02:33.988
What? Where?
Look. Over there.

21
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:36.057
What are they doing?

22
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.459
Looks like
they're stealing
the crane!

23
00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:45.132
Oh, my goodness.
They're heading straight
for the welding tanks!

24
00:03:07.822 --> 00:03:10.958
Hello? PAW Patrol?
This is Janet from J&H Scrap.

25
00:03:10.992 --> 00:03:13.227
The whole place
is burning down!

26
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.627
You've got to come quick!

27
00:03:31.912 --> 00:03:34.614
All right, pups,
we've got a fire
at the scrapyard.

28
00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:37.318
And by the sounds of it,
we don't have much time.

29
00:03:37.351 --> 00:03:40.287
No fire's too big,
no pup's too small!

30
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.596
Skye, you are clear
for takeoff.

31
00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.432
Let's take to the sky!

32
00:03:54.335 --> 00:03:56.636
And away we go!

33
00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:04.111
Pups, get ready to launch.

34
00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:40.747
PAW Patrol is on a roll!

35
00:05:02.336 --> 00:05:03.971
I've got eyes
on the fire.

36
00:05:04.004 --> 00:05:07.208
It's a big one.
I'm going in for a water drop.

37
00:05:21.222 --> 00:05:24.825
The entrance is blocked.
I'm gonna clear a way in.

38
00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:33.801
Whoo! Bullseye!

39
00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:37.404
Hot dog! It's the PAW Patrol!
They're gonna save us!

40
00:05:37.438 --> 00:05:40.141
The PAW Patrol! Oh, Bruce,
you're gonna love them.

41
00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:43.544
They're cute little puppies
who drive around in cars.

42
00:05:43.577 --> 00:05:45.880
I know that sounds weird,
but just go with it.

43
00:05:49.817 --> 00:05:52.520
All right, Marshall,
let's fight that fire.

44
00:05:52.553 --> 00:05:54.488
Arf! Water cannon!

45
00:06:18.546 --> 00:06:20.047
- Help!
- Over here!

46
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.415
Help!
Help!

47
00:06:21.448 --> 00:06:22.883
Help us!

48
00:06:22.917 --> 00:06:25.152
Marshall, the trailer's
on fire!

49
00:06:25.186 --> 00:06:26.719
I'm all out of water!

50
00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:28.956
- Oh, no.
- Incoming!

51
00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:36.463
Yeah, Skye!

52
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:53.180
You see that right there?
That's why she's
my favorite pup.

53
00:06:53.214 --> 00:06:54.747
PAW Patrol!

54
00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:56.817
Let's get you out of there.

55
00:06:58.152 --> 00:07:00.521
Whoa!

56
00:07:00.554 --> 00:07:01.989
Oh!

57
00:07:02.022 --> 00:07:03.390
Oops. Sorry.

58
00:07:03.424 --> 00:07:05.826
And that's why
I wear a hard hat.

59
00:07:06.694 --> 00:07:09.296
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

60
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.765
We're just glad you're okay.
Hopefully there's not
too much damage.

61
00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:16.337
Well, the good thing
is it was all junk
to begin with.

62
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.640
These are the brave pups
I was telling you about.

63
00:07:19.673 --> 00:07:22.076
This is Bruce.
He's a sensitive soul.

64
00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:24.178
This is all
a bit much for him.

65
00:07:25.212 --> 00:07:27.815
Hey, let's get a picture
with Bruce and the pups.

66
00:07:27.848 --> 00:07:29.183
Oh, great idea.

67
00:07:29.216 --> 00:07:31.986
Janet, grab the little one
so she gets in the photo.

68
00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:34.488
I'm fine down here.
Come here, sweetie.

69
00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:36.557
Everybody say, "Junk."

70
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.158
Junk!

71
00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:42.429
Ugh! I hate being
the smallest pup.

72
00:07:42.463 --> 00:07:46.000
If she picked me up like that,
I'd have hit her
with the dog breath.

73
00:07:49.136 --> 00:07:52.606
That trailer was locked
from the outside.
How did that happen?

74
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.976
Well, you're not
gonna believe this,
but somebody locked us up

75
00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.313
so they could steal
our 10-ton electromagnet.

76
00:07:59.346 --> 00:08:03.350
Who would want to steal
a 10-ton electromagnet?

77
00:08:25.239 --> 00:08:27.141
It's showtime.

78
00:08:32.079 --> 00:08:33.681
Hey, what's going on,
everybody?

79
00:08:33.714 --> 00:08:37.318
I'm Sam Stringer here,
reporting live from
downtown Adventure City,

80
00:08:37.351 --> 00:08:39.620
where we're about to see
the largest meteor shower

81
00:08:39.653 --> 00:08:41.922
we've had in over 50 years.

82
00:08:41.955 --> 00:08:44.625
Meteor! Meteor! Meteor!

83
00:08:44.658 --> 00:08:48.228
Ah, I'm just so excited
to see the meteor,
Chickaletta.

84
00:08:49.396 --> 00:08:51.532
As you can see,
it's meteor fever out here,

85
00:08:51.565 --> 00:08:54.568
and everyone is turning
their eyes to the sky.

86
00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:57.905
Meteor! Meteor! Meteor...

87
00:09:06.647 --> 00:09:07.681
See any meteors?

88
00:09:09.283 --> 00:09:11.719
All I can see
is your giant head.

89
00:09:11.752 --> 00:09:14.154
Oops. Sorry.

90
00:09:14.188 --> 00:09:17.191
Come on, Rubble.
You're gonna miss the meteor.

91
00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:18.592
Do you really
expect me to watch

92
00:09:18.625 --> 00:09:22.262
a once-in-a-lifetime
celestial event
without snacks?

93
00:09:27.768 --> 00:09:30.437
Hey, Chase,
you have a rip
in your suit.

94
00:09:30.471 --> 00:09:31.672
I do?

95
00:09:31.705 --> 00:09:34.742
Yeah. Looks like
you're too big for
this thing already.

96
00:09:34.775 --> 00:09:36.744
You're all growing so fast.

97
00:09:36.777 --> 00:09:39.213
All of us? Even me?

98
00:09:39.246 --> 00:09:42.583
Not yet, Skye. You're still
pretty much the same size.

99
00:09:42.616 --> 00:09:46.186
But it's nothing
to worry about. All pups
grow at their own speed.

100
00:09:47.187 --> 00:09:49.556
And some of us
never grow at all.

101
00:09:51.158 --> 00:09:52.593
Oh, great.
They're here.

102
00:09:53.994 --> 00:09:57.297
Come on up. Pups,
we've got company.

103
00:09:58.867 --> 00:10:01.301
I'd like you to meet
the Junior Patrollers.

104
00:10:01.335 --> 00:10:02.569
Nano.
Hello!

105
00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:03.670
Mini.
Hi!

106
00:10:03.704 --> 00:10:05.339
And Tot.
What's up?

107
00:10:05.372 --> 00:10:07.608
When they grow up,
they want to be
in the PAW Patrol.

108
00:10:07.641 --> 00:10:10.611
So I invited them to watch
the meteor shower with us.

109
00:10:10.644 --> 00:10:12.379
You're Chase.

110
00:10:12.413 --> 00:10:13.580
Uh, yep.

111
00:10:13.614 --> 00:10:15.516
You're on the case.

112
00:10:15.549 --> 00:10:16.984
I guess I am.

113
00:10:17.918 --> 00:10:19.854
And you're Rubble!

114
00:10:19.888 --> 00:10:22.423
Cool glasses.
Thank you.

115
00:10:22.456 --> 00:10:25.526
Wow, Skye, I'm almost
as tall as you!

116
00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:30.798
Well, I'm definitely taller.
But not for long.

117
00:10:30.832 --> 00:10:32.733
Why don't you guys
check out the telescope?

118
00:10:32.766 --> 00:10:34.701
Whoa!
My turn, my turn!

119
00:10:34.735 --> 00:10:37.137
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa, whoa!

120
00:10:38.038 --> 00:10:39.640
Take it easy, puffballs.

121
00:10:39.673 --> 00:10:41.308
This thing is expensive.

122
00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:42.376
Oops.
Whoops.

123
00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:43.777
Sorry.

124
00:10:43.812 --> 00:10:45.612
Let's try that again.

125
00:10:45.646 --> 00:10:49.116
Take a look through
the eyepiece and tell us
what you see.

126
00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:52.352
Carefully look through
the eyepiece. Carefully.

127
00:10:54.755 --> 00:10:58.225
I don't know about this whole
"Junior Patrollers" thing.

128
00:10:58.258 --> 00:10:59.828
I mean, when did
the PAW Patrol become

129
00:10:59.861 --> 00:11:01.462
a babysitting service?

130
00:11:01.495 --> 00:11:02.996
Come on, Liberty.

131
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.432
Don't write them off
just because they're small.

132
00:11:05.466 --> 00:11:06.500
Whoa!

133
00:11:06.533 --> 00:11:07.968
Look at all the stars.

134
00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:10.003
There must be
a billion of them.

135
00:11:10.037 --> 00:11:11.572
We should count them all.

136
00:11:11.605 --> 00:11:12.473
Okay.

137
00:11:12.506 --> 00:11:19.146
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

138
00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:32.092
Hello, world. Hello, universe.
Hello, Internet!

139
00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:33.962
My name is Victoria Vance,

140
00:11:33.994 --> 00:11:36.163
and I'm making
this video as proof

141
00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:38.967
that I'm the greatest
scientist in history.

142
00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:41.502
Oh, and don't
believe the rumors.

143
00:11:41.535 --> 00:11:43.504
I'm not a mad scientist.

144
00:11:43.537 --> 00:11:46.875
I mean, sure, sometimes
I act a little mad,

145
00:11:46.908 --> 00:11:49.076
and I am a scientist,

146
00:11:49.109 --> 00:11:52.679
but that doesn't make me
a mad scientist.

147
00:11:52.713 --> 00:11:54.548
You got that? Good.

148
00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:01.321
Now, I've been
tracking meteor X-2805
for the past two years.

149
00:12:01.355 --> 00:12:04.224
It contains some kind of
power source

150
00:12:04.258 --> 00:12:07.194
stronger than anything
we've ever seen on Earth.

151
00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:11.532
Which brings me to my latest
invention, the Meteor Magnet!

152
00:12:13.033 --> 00:12:15.135
Cool name, right?

153
00:12:15.168 --> 00:12:17.204
This sweet little tractor beam

154
00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:19.406
will pull that meteor
out of the sky

155
00:12:19.439 --> 00:12:22.676
and gently deliver
it to my doorstep.

156
00:12:25.379 --> 00:12:28.850
Now, let's get ready to party.

157
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.435
Whoo-hoo!

158
00:12:48.468 --> 00:12:51.138
I've locked on to the meteor
and I'm reeling it in!

159
00:12:54.741 --> 00:12:57.144
I did it. I did it!

160
00:12:57.177 --> 00:12:59.780
Me. Victoria Vance.

161
00:12:59.814 --> 00:13:02.749
To all the haters out there
who laughed at me

162
00:13:02.783 --> 00:13:07.654
and called me a mad scientist,
who's laughing now?

163
00:13:11.558 --> 00:13:12.759
Uh-oh.

164
00:13:15.529 --> 00:13:17.932
No! No, no, no!

165
00:13:17.966 --> 00:13:20.334
The meteor is stronger
than I expected.

166
00:13:29.343 --> 00:13:31.879
I don't have enough power!

167
00:13:41.923 --> 00:13:45.125
That is not good.

168
00:13:52.834 --> 00:13:56.136
...3,034, 3,035,

169
00:13:56.169 --> 00:14:00.908
3,036, 3,037, 3,038...

170
00:14:00.942 --> 00:14:03.011
There it is!

171
00:14:03.044 --> 00:14:05.212
Whoa.

172
00:14:06.246 --> 00:14:08.715
I didn't think
it would be so bright.

173
00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:10.985
It looks like it's headed
straight for us.

174
00:14:13.754 --> 00:14:16.289
That's because it is!

175
00:14:16.323 --> 00:14:18.458
Everybody out
of the pup tower!

176
00:14:28.568 --> 00:14:31.105
Get those
people inside! Go, go, go!

177
00:14:31.139 --> 00:14:35.242
Everybody out of the street!
You need to take cover
right now!

178
00:14:35.275 --> 00:14:38.278
Take shelter!
The meteor's heading
straight for us!

179
00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:47.187
Everybody inside! Get inside!

180
00:14:52.325 --> 00:14:53.961
Oh!
Come on, buddy.
Get up. Let's go.

181
00:14:55.762 --> 00:14:58.732
Get out of the street!
We don't have much time!

182
00:15:01.002 --> 00:15:02.202
Clear!

183
00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:04.738
Street's clear!

184
00:15:05.605 --> 00:15:06.440
Clear!

185
00:15:06.473 --> 00:15:08.608
Good job, pups.
Now take cover!

186
00:15:26.928 --> 00:15:27.962
Get down!

187
00:15:42.043 --> 00:15:43.543
Is everybody okay?

188
00:15:44.212 --> 00:15:45.412
I'm okay.

189
00:15:46.747 --> 00:15:48.582
I'm good.

190
00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:52.019
I'm fine, but I'm gonna need
a serious bath.

191
00:15:57.724 --> 00:15:59.359
Oh, my goodness.

192
00:15:59.392 --> 00:16:01.628
Wait. Where are
the Junior Patrollers?

193
00:16:02.196 --> 00:16:04.798
Nano? Mini? Tot?

194
00:16:05.833 --> 00:16:06.868
Whoa!

195
00:16:06.901 --> 00:16:09.904
That was epic.

196
00:16:09.937 --> 00:16:12.907
I'm so glad nobody got hurt.

197
00:16:13.808 --> 00:16:15.810
Oh, no. Look.

198
00:16:18.779 --> 00:16:23.483
The pup tower.
It's completely destroyed.

199
00:16:27.354 --> 00:16:29.790
Our home.
Our vehicles.

200
00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:32.425
It's all gone.

201
00:16:44.172 --> 00:16:46.406
That little thing
did all this?

202
00:16:52.379 --> 00:16:57.051
This meteor is
giving off some kind of
strange energy pulse.

203
00:16:57.084 --> 00:16:59.954
Let's get it out of here until
we find out what's going on.

204
00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.761
At approximately 7:31 p.m.,

205
00:17:07.794 --> 00:17:10.530
a meteor, which was meant
to safely pass by the planet,

206
00:17:10.564 --> 00:17:14.235
suddenly veered off course,
crashing into Adventure City,

207
00:17:14.268 --> 00:17:16.536
causing massive destruction!

208
00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:20.407
I was there, people!
I almost got squashed!

209
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.844
Whew! Okay.

210
00:17:22.877 --> 00:17:25.579
The mad scientist
Victoria Vance was arrested

211
00:17:25.612 --> 00:17:28.115
after taking credit
for the disaster online.

212
00:17:28.149 --> 00:17:32.619
<i>I did it! Me.</i>
<i>Victoria Vance.</i>

213
00:17:32.652 --> 00:17:35.655
Yikes. Ooh!
That's an open and shut case.

214
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.764
You can't lock me up!

215
00:17:44.798 --> 00:17:48.602
I'm the greatest scientist
in the world!

216
00:17:48.635 --> 00:17:51.038
More like the maddest
scientist in the world.

217
00:17:51.072 --> 00:17:52.405
I heard that.

218
00:17:52.439 --> 00:17:55.810
I am not a mad scientist!

219
00:18:03.317 --> 00:18:05.086
Hello, roomie.

220
00:18:28.943 --> 00:18:31.711
It looks like
it stopped glowing.

221
00:18:31.745 --> 00:18:35.448
Maybe that's a good thing.
The glowing freaks me out.

222
00:18:46.227 --> 00:18:49.230
This will analyze the meteor
and tell us what it's made of.

223
00:18:49.263 --> 00:18:52.532
We'll leave it scanning
overnight and see what
we can learn.

224
00:18:58.072 --> 00:19:00.507
All right, pups, time for bed.

225
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:06.713
Argh, come on.

226
00:19:06.746 --> 00:19:08.481
Need a little help
there, Skye?

227
00:19:08.515 --> 00:19:10.384
Nope. No, I got it.

228
00:19:36.911 --> 00:19:40.247
Good night, pups.
If you need me,
I'm just down the hall.

229
00:19:40.281 --> 00:19:41.949
Ryder?
Yeah?

230
00:19:41.983 --> 00:19:45.719
I miss the pup tower.
I don't like sleeping
in new places.

231
00:19:45.752 --> 00:19:48.122
I'm never gonna be able
to get to sleep.

232
00:19:48.155 --> 00:19:52.893
Well, we've all had
a long day. You're probably
more tired than you think.

233
00:20:00.267 --> 00:20:01.735
See you in the morning.

234
00:20:26.994 --> 00:20:29.696
Rubble, quit messing
with the light.

235
00:20:33.267 --> 00:20:35.069
Rubble!

236
00:20:38.472 --> 00:20:39.773
What is that?

237
00:21:54.181 --> 00:21:55.249
Weird.

238
00:21:59.453 --> 00:22:00.855
I didn't do it!

239
00:22:26.347 --> 00:22:27.747
No way.

240
00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:40.961
Whoa.

241
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:44.198
Whoa!

242
00:22:49.069 --> 00:22:50.137
Whoa.

243
00:22:51.105 --> 00:22:52.106
Whoa.

244
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.191
Looks like the smallest pup
just became the strongest pup.

245
00:23:19.533 --> 00:23:22.803
All right, let's see
what this thing
can really do.

246
00:23:26.207 --> 00:23:27.241
Whoa!

247
00:23:28.175 --> 00:23:30.710
What's going on?
Is everybody okay?

248
00:23:31.946 --> 00:23:35.316
I think I've got superpowers.

249
00:23:37.384 --> 00:23:38.452
Whoa.

250
00:23:39.386 --> 00:23:41.155
Whoa.

251
00:23:41.188 --> 00:23:42.990
No way.

252
00:23:46.627 --> 00:23:49.964
This is the weirdest dream
I've ever had.

253
00:23:49.997 --> 00:23:53.367
Uh, Rubble,
you're not dreaming.

254
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:57.238
Oh. Then this is the weirdest
awake I've ever had.

255
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.953
Look at your paws.

256
00:24:17.224 --> 00:24:18.659
Whoa.

257
00:24:18.692 --> 00:24:20.961
It's some kind of fireball.

258
00:24:20.995 --> 00:24:23.831
Well, that makes sense.
You're a fire pup.

259
00:24:23.864 --> 00:24:26.000
I wonder what
your power is.

260
00:24:27.835 --> 00:24:29.903
- Huh? Chase?
- Marshall!

261
00:24:29.937 --> 00:24:34.041
Up here!
Hey, how'd you get
over there so fast?

262
00:24:35.342 --> 00:24:36.710
Get over where?

263
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:41.815
Great. Now the clumsy pup

264
00:24:41.849 --> 00:24:43.783
shoots fireballs
out of his paws.

265
00:24:43.817 --> 00:24:45.519
Don't worry. I got it.

266
00:24:49.657 --> 00:24:53.127
Dudes,
I'm one with the water.

267
00:24:57.064 --> 00:24:58.232
Awesome.

268
00:25:04.605 --> 00:25:07.207
Check me out.
I'm a walking magnet.

269
00:25:07.975 --> 00:25:09.510
Huh?

270
00:25:13.914 --> 00:25:15.149
Sorry about that.

271
00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:19.453
Cool. I'm a wrecking ball.

272
00:25:25.059 --> 00:25:27.528
Whoa, Rubble, are you okay?

273
00:25:28.429 --> 00:25:30.197
Rock 'n' roll!

274
00:25:36.437 --> 00:25:37.938
What's your power, Liberty?

275
00:25:37.971 --> 00:25:40.507
That's a good question.
I'm trying to figure it out.

276
00:25:40.541 --> 00:25:43.277
Okay, come on. Here we go.
Superpowers on three.

277
00:25:43.744 --> 00:25:46.347
One, two, three.

278
00:25:47.314 --> 00:25:48.515
Whoa!

279
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:50.150
Okay, okay.

280
00:25:50.184 --> 00:25:53.120
It's not
the power of flight.

281
00:25:53.153 --> 00:25:57.057
That's because
it's magnet paws!

282
00:25:58.492 --> 00:25:59.493
Nope.

283
00:26:03.964 --> 00:26:07.301
That's it.
I'm a superpowered
wrecking ball!

284
00:26:08.669 --> 00:26:10.070
Yeah!

285
00:26:10.104 --> 00:26:11.105
Whoo!

286
00:26:14.441 --> 00:26:17.478
What's going on here?
I've got no powers.

287
00:26:17.511 --> 00:26:18.512
What a rip-off.

288
00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:22.817
Skye can fly.
Marshall can control fire.

289
00:26:22.851 --> 00:26:24.618
Zuma turns to water.

290
00:26:24.651 --> 00:26:27.488
It's like these crystals
amplify something about you.

291
00:26:28.021 --> 00:26:30.557
But I'm just Liberty.

292
00:26:30.591 --> 00:26:31.692
What's my thing?

293
00:26:45.439 --> 00:26:49.343
Now that we're super,
we're gonna need a new name
for ourselves.

294
00:26:49.376 --> 00:26:53.247
Why do we need a new name?
We're the PAW Patrol.

295
00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.382
I know, but now we're more.

296
00:26:55.416 --> 00:26:58.519
It's like we've got something
just a little bit extra.

297
00:26:58.887 --> 00:27:00.187
Ooh! I know.

298
00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.622
How about we call ourselves

299
00:27:01.655 --> 00:27:07.261
"the PAW Patrol But More
With Just A Little Bit Extra"?

300
00:27:08.462 --> 00:27:11.031
It doesn't exactly
roll off the tongue.

301
00:27:12.966 --> 00:27:16.770
How about "the Mighty Pups"?

302
00:27:46.366 --> 00:27:49.102
Ready for action,
Ryder, sir!

303
00:28:03.016 --> 00:28:04.651
Whoa!

304
00:28:17.664 --> 00:28:21.068
<i>Chase, Marshall,</i>
<i>ready for launch.</i>

305
00:28:21.101 --> 00:28:22.469
Power paws!

306
00:28:22.503 --> 00:28:27.241
<i>Ten, nine, eight,</i>

307
00:28:27.274 --> 00:28:32.914
<i>seven, six, five, four...</i>

308
00:28:32.947 --> 00:28:36.517
<i>...three, two, one,</i>

309
00:28:38.318 --> 00:28:39.319
<i>go!</i>

310
00:28:48.328 --> 00:28:49.796
Power paws!

311
00:28:52.099 --> 00:28:54.501
<i>Skye, Rocky,</i>

312
00:28:55.937 --> 00:28:57.170
<i>go!</i>

313
00:29:01.508 --> 00:29:04.711
<i>Zuma, Rubble,</i>
<i>ready for launch.</i>

314
00:29:04.745 --> 00:29:08.883
- Did he say "lunch"?
<i>- No, I said launch!</i>

315
00:29:08.917 --> 00:29:10.617
<i>Go!</i>

316
00:29:14.956 --> 00:29:16.390
Uh, Ryder?

317
00:29:16.423 --> 00:29:19.994
As you know, I didn't get
any superpowers.

318
00:29:20.028 --> 00:29:21.963
So, I'm not totally sure
what to do here.

319
00:29:21.996 --> 00:29:24.064
I've been thinking
about that, Liberty,

320
00:29:24.097 --> 00:29:26.366
and I've got a very important
mission for you.

321
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.436
You do? Yes! That's what
I'm talking about!

322
00:29:29.469 --> 00:29:32.040
Whatever you need,
anything at all, I'm your pup.

323
00:29:32.072 --> 00:29:36.176
Great. I need you
to hang back and look after
the Junior Patrollers.

324
00:29:37.979 --> 00:29:40.180
Oh, that's not a good idea.
Nope. Mm-mm.

325
00:29:40.213 --> 00:29:41.481
I'm trying to be
more flexible,

326
00:29:41.515 --> 00:29:44.251
but I don't know the first
thing about little kids.

327
00:29:44.284 --> 00:29:46.620
Don't worry, Liberty.
You'll be great at it.

328
00:29:46.653 --> 00:29:48.689
Mighty Pups are on a roll!

329
00:29:50.524 --> 00:29:55.295
Ryder, come back!
I'm not built for babysitting!

330
00:30:03.737 --> 00:30:04.738
Oh!

331
00:30:48.782 --> 00:30:50.584
<i>When we hear</i>
<i>the word "superpowers,"</i>

332
00:30:50.617 --> 00:30:52.452
we usually think of big-budget
Hollywood movies

333
00:30:52.486 --> 00:30:54.621
starring overpaid celebrities
wearing tights.

334
00:30:54.655 --> 00:30:56.757
But now we know
superpowers are real.

335
00:30:56.790 --> 00:31:00.962
And the fluffy little doggies
who got them call themselves
"the Mighty Pups."

336
00:31:00.995 --> 00:31:02.396
Help!

337
00:31:18.046 --> 00:31:22.282
They got new powers,
new uniforms
and new merchandise.

338
00:31:22.315 --> 00:31:25.385
To all the parents
out there, I'm sorry.

339
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:30.457
That was my meteor.

340
00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:32.559
Those should be
my superpowers.

341
00:31:32.592 --> 00:31:35.228
I can't stand
those little mongrels.

342
00:31:35.262 --> 00:31:37.664
I can't stand
the PAW Patrol either.

343
00:31:37.698 --> 00:31:41.234
That's what makes us
such perfect roommates.

344
00:31:41.268 --> 00:31:42.837
Yeah, well, don't get
too attached.

345
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:44.972
As soon as I can find
my way out of here,

346
00:31:45.006 --> 00:31:47.207
I'm gonna get
my meteor back.

347
00:31:48.009 --> 00:31:49.143
Can you give us a minute?

348
00:31:49.177 --> 00:31:51.145
I need to discuss
something in private

349
00:31:51.179 --> 00:31:53.014
with my colleagues.

350
00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.823
Okay, here's the deal.

351
00:32:01.856 --> 00:32:05.093
The kitties and I
have been planning
a jailbreak.

352
00:32:05.126 --> 00:32:06.626
We'll help you
fly the coop

353
00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:10.865
if you promise to share
some of those superpowers
with me.

354
00:32:10.898 --> 00:32:12.365
Do we have a deal?

355
00:32:12.399 --> 00:32:17.404
I don't really have a lot
of options right now,
so sure, it's a deal.

356
00:32:17.437 --> 00:32:20.340
It's only a deal
if we shake on it.

357
00:32:21.608 --> 00:32:22.642
Ugh.

358
00:32:22.676 --> 00:32:24.678
We all shake on it.

359
00:32:27.748 --> 00:32:29.750
Ugh! Are you kidding me?

360
00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:36.356
Excellent, excellent.
Sealing the deal.
Wonderful.

361
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:38.792
Now, if you'll direct
your attention over there,

362
00:32:38.826 --> 00:32:42.362
I left you
a little surprise
in the toilet.

363
00:32:44.031 --> 00:32:46.399
Yeah. No, thanks.
I'm good.

364
00:32:46.433 --> 00:32:49.302
Don't be shy.
Lift the lid.

365
00:32:56.610 --> 00:33:00.081
That's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

366
00:33:00.114 --> 00:33:02.817
It took me a lot
of hard work.

367
00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:12.626
<i>The Mighty Pups have</i>
<i>incredible superpowers.</i>

368
00:33:12.659 --> 00:33:17.531
<i>Skye can fly, Chase has</i>
<i>super speed and Rubble</i>
<i>is a real-life wrecking ball.</i>

369
00:33:17.564 --> 00:33:19.466
Okay, no more messing around.

370
00:33:19.499 --> 00:33:23.971
My superpower is fire paws!

371
00:33:25.372 --> 00:33:28.176
Nope. Okay. Okay. That's okay.

372
00:33:28.209 --> 00:33:30.744
It's super speed.

373
00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:37.417
I think I'm gonna be sick.

374
00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:40.121
<i>Thanks to</i>
<i>the superpowers contained</i>
<i>in the mysterious meteor,</i>

375
00:33:40.154 --> 00:33:42.924
<i>these pups are truly</i>
<i>unstoppable.</i>

376
00:33:42.957 --> 00:33:46.359
Come on, Liberty.
Be flexible. Be flexible!

377
00:33:46.393 --> 00:33:50.363
<i>Adventure City simply</i>
<i>can't get enough</i>
<i>of these Mighty Pups.</i>

378
00:33:50.998 --> 00:33:51.933
Hey!

379
00:33:51.966 --> 00:33:55.102
We were watching that.
That's the problem.

380
00:33:55.136 --> 00:33:57.337
We're just sitting
around watching.

381
00:33:57.370 --> 00:34:01.275
We might not have superpowers,
but that doesn't mean
we can't contribute.

382
00:34:01.309 --> 00:34:03.077
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

383
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:07.081
but are you three puffballs
serious about joining
the PAW Patrol one day?

384
00:34:07.114 --> 00:34:08.916
Yes!
Absolutely!

385
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:11.886
More than anything
in the entire universe!

386
00:34:11.919 --> 00:34:14.754
Then you guys are going
to be my personal project.

387
00:34:14.788 --> 00:34:16.523
I'm gonna teach you
everything I know,

388
00:34:16.556 --> 00:34:20.727
and turn you into lean, mean,
fluffy little rescue machines.

389
00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.063
Wicked!

390
00:34:24.332 --> 00:34:28.202
...97, 98, 99, 100.

391
00:34:28.236 --> 00:34:29.536
Your turn.

392
00:34:30.137 --> 00:34:31.906
One...
One...

393
00:34:34.075 --> 00:34:36.043
Yeesh.

394
00:34:36.077 --> 00:34:39.746
You're running with the big
dogs now! No pain, no gain!

395
00:34:49.056 --> 00:34:50.825
Let's do this!

396
00:34:51.725 --> 00:34:54.694
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

397
00:34:56.964 --> 00:34:58.398
Ugh.

398
00:34:58.431 --> 00:35:00.001
<i>Come on! Move it, move it!</i>

399
00:35:00.034 --> 00:35:02.169
<i>We're gonna take you</i>
<i>from puff to tough!</i>

400
00:35:02.203 --> 00:35:04.939
<i>Is that all you got?</i>
<i>I thought you wanted</i>
<i>to be in the PAW Patrol.</i>

401
00:35:04.972 --> 00:35:06.874
<i>I want to see you hustle.</i>

402
00:35:07.875 --> 00:35:09.343
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

403
00:35:09.377 --> 00:35:12.847
<i>You're lean, you're mean,</i>
<i>you're a fluffy little</i>
<i>rescue machine!</i>

404
00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.015
Take it easy, Liberty.

405
00:35:14.048 --> 00:35:17.417
Remember, the Junior Patroller
program is just for fun.

406
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:20.720
And there's nothing
more fun than realizing
your full potential.

407
00:35:20.754 --> 00:35:21.655
Huh?

408
00:35:21.688 --> 00:35:23.324
<i>I didn't say stop.</i>

409
00:35:23.357 --> 00:35:24.859
<i>Move it, move it, move it!</i>

410
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:38.806
Not much further.
We're almost there.

411
00:35:38.839 --> 00:35:41.108
You said that
two miles ago.

412
00:35:41.142 --> 00:35:44.879
Oh, stop complaining.
Just be happy
I broke you out of jail.

413
00:35:47.714 --> 00:35:51.484
I'll be happy when I have
something else to look at.

414
00:35:51.518 --> 00:35:53.220
We're here!

415
00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:04.131
Ah!

416
00:36:04.165 --> 00:36:06.934
The sweet smell of freedom.

417
00:36:08.468 --> 00:36:11.471
Is that Humdinger?
What's he doing
out of jail?

418
00:36:11.504 --> 00:36:15.943
It is me. And I hope
I can count on your support
in the next election.

419
00:36:15.977 --> 00:36:18.846
Stop campaigning.
We're fugitives on the run.

420
00:36:18.879 --> 00:36:20.114
Sorry. I forgot.

421
00:36:20.147 --> 00:36:24.452
It's just so nice
to be reunited
with my adoring public.

422
00:36:24.484 --> 00:36:26.320
Ha! I didn't vote for you.

423
00:36:26.354 --> 00:36:30.157
Me neither.
You were the worst mayor
the city's ever had.

424
00:36:30.191 --> 00:36:33.828
Hmm! This is why I hate
free and fair elections.

425
00:36:33.861 --> 00:36:35.830
We just got to keep
a low profile

426
00:36:35.863 --> 00:36:39.433
until we get those superpowers
from the PAW Patrol.

427
00:36:39.467 --> 00:36:41.969
And how do you propose
we do that?

428
00:36:42.003 --> 00:36:46.907
We give them the one thing
they can't resist.

429
00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:56.884
There it is.

430
00:36:56.917 --> 00:37:00.653
- Air Humdinger.
- It's perfect.

431
00:37:00.687 --> 00:37:02.356
Oh, I've missed you.

432
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:05.893
I had nightmares in jail
about flying coach.

433
00:37:07.694 --> 00:37:11.132
Are you sure you know
how to fly this thing?

434
00:37:11.165 --> 00:37:14.435
Oh, don't worry.
Your tacky little jet
is in good hands.

435
00:37:14.468 --> 00:37:17.838
I've been flying planes
like this since I was
in grade school.

436
00:37:19.407 --> 00:37:21.075
Must have been
a good school.

437
00:37:36.556 --> 00:37:38.092
<i>Autopilot activated.</i>

438
00:37:38.125 --> 00:37:41.929
Now we just fly around
until the PAW Patrol
comes to rescue us.

439
00:37:41.962 --> 00:37:45.166
And why would they do that?
Because of this.

440
00:37:48.635 --> 00:37:50.670
Are you out
of your mind?

441
00:37:51.272 --> 00:37:52.339
Whee!

442
00:37:54.075 --> 00:37:55.276
What are you doing?

443
00:37:55.309 --> 00:37:59.646
Now we're in trouble.
They'll have to come
rescue us!

444
00:37:59.679 --> 00:38:02.116
That was your plan?

445
00:38:02.149 --> 00:38:03.551
Uh-huh!

446
00:38:03.583 --> 00:38:07.922
Now sit down and eat
some cashews while
I go yelp for help!

447
00:38:14.727 --> 00:38:16.030
Stop, drop and roll!

448
00:38:17.697 --> 00:38:18.833
Did you see that?

449
00:38:18.866 --> 00:38:21.302
They're getting it.
These pups are legit.

450
00:38:21.335 --> 00:38:25.638
I'm happy for you, Liberty,
but maybe it's time
for a break.

451
00:38:25.672 --> 00:38:27.508
Do you guys want a break?

452
00:38:27.541 --> 00:38:29.776
We don't need
no stinking break!

453
00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:32.446
Ha-ha! That's what
I'm talking about, puffballs.

454
00:38:33.547 --> 00:38:34.915
PAW Patrol.
What's your emergency?

455
00:38:34.949 --> 00:38:38.285
<i>Mayday, mayday!</i>
<i>This is flight HD9904.</i>

456
00:38:38.319 --> 00:38:42.056
<i>We need immediate assistance.</i>
Hang tight. We're on our way.

457
00:38:49.597 --> 00:38:53.334
Skye, I need you
to fly up there and carry
that plane down safely.

458
00:38:53.367 --> 00:38:54.502
Are you up for it?

459
00:38:54.535 --> 00:38:57.972
I'm a Mighty Pup.
I was made for this.

460
00:38:58.005 --> 00:39:00.574
We'll provide ground support.
Come on, pups.

461
00:39:02.642 --> 00:39:04.812
Let's take to the sky!

462
00:39:22.695 --> 00:39:24.398
The PAW Patrol is here!

463
00:39:24.431 --> 00:39:27.667
Cut the engines and I'll carry
the plane down safely.

464
00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:30.471
And here you are!

465
00:39:30.504 --> 00:39:31.639
Humdinger?

466
00:39:31.671 --> 00:39:35.342
It worked exactly like
she said it would.

467
00:39:35.376 --> 00:39:37.311
Like who said it would?

468
00:39:37.344 --> 00:39:38.379
Me.

469
00:39:38.412 --> 00:39:39.580
My crystal!

470
00:39:39.613 --> 00:39:42.550
It's like taking candy
from a baby.

471
00:39:42.583 --> 00:39:44.151
Give that back.

472
00:39:44.185 --> 00:39:45.386
Ooh!

473
00:39:45.419 --> 00:39:47.188
You're a feisty one,
aren't you?

474
00:39:50.824 --> 00:39:54.295
Catch you around, pipsqueak.
Buh-bye!

475
00:39:55.396 --> 00:39:56.630
No!

476
00:39:56.664 --> 00:39:58.599
Thank you for flying
Air Humdinger.

477
00:39:59.699 --> 00:40:01.502
Whoo-hoo!

478
00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.935
Ryder, come in.
This is Skye.

479
00:40:34.969 --> 00:40:36.303
<i>How's it going</i>
<i>up there?</i>

480
00:40:36.337 --> 00:40:37.705
It was a trap.

481
00:40:37.737 --> 00:40:41.774
They stole my crystal,
I've got no powers and
this plane is going down.

482
00:40:41.809 --> 00:40:43.244
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

483
00:40:44.645 --> 00:40:47.147
I can't get a visual. Hang on.

484
00:40:47.181 --> 00:40:49.183
<i>Can you make it back</i>
<i>to the airport?</i>

485
00:40:51.751 --> 00:40:56.056
Negative. It's too far.
I need a place to land
this thing now.

486
00:40:58.192 --> 00:41:00.261
Copy that.
We'll have to improvise.

487
00:41:09.103 --> 00:41:10.871
Skye,
we're clearing a runway.

488
00:41:10.904 --> 00:41:13.040
I need you to set a course
for Main Street.

489
00:41:13.073 --> 00:41:15.276
Did you say Main Street?
<i>Affirmative.</i>

490
00:41:15.309 --> 00:41:18.212
That's the busiest street
in Adventure City.

491
00:41:19.647 --> 00:41:21.148
It's also the longest.

492
00:41:25.619 --> 00:41:29.123
All right, pups.
We need to make a runway
and we don't have much time.

493
00:41:29.156 --> 00:41:31.358
Let's move it, people.

494
00:41:31.392 --> 00:41:35.296
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

495
00:41:35.329 --> 00:41:37.998
Chase, mark the runway.
All the way down.

496
00:41:38.032 --> 00:41:39.533
Chase is on the case.

497
00:41:40.701 --> 00:41:42.870
Arf! Flares!

498
00:41:44.605 --> 00:41:47.708
I feel the need
for super speed.

499
00:42:09.797 --> 00:42:13.167
This intersection is closed!

500
00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.135
<i>I've got a visual</i>
<i>on the runway.</i>

501
00:42:15.903 --> 00:42:18.072
All right, let's do this.

502
00:42:21.775 --> 00:42:26.947
Close your eyes and listen to
the calming sound of my voice.

503
00:42:31.652 --> 00:42:33.787
I'm on final approach.

504
00:42:36.825 --> 00:42:38.092
Oh, no.

505
00:42:41.895 --> 00:42:43.263
I'm going under!

506
00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.401
Whoa!

507
00:42:50.337 --> 00:42:54.641
Come on, baby.
Soft landing. Soft landing.

508
00:42:57.411 --> 00:42:59.880
Oof! Okay, hard landing.

509
00:43:03.484 --> 00:43:04.485
Whoa.

510
00:43:06.855 --> 00:43:09.390
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

511
00:43:20.534 --> 00:43:23.036
Now that's a nice parking job.

512
00:43:36.383 --> 00:43:38.419
They're back.
Come on. They're back.

513
00:43:38.452 --> 00:43:40.287
Awesome!
Yeah!

514
00:43:40.687 --> 00:43:41.922
How'd it go?

515
00:43:42.322 --> 00:43:43.457
Not good.

516
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:46.026
Come on. You guys
are the Mighty Pups.

517
00:43:46.059 --> 00:43:49.496
How bad could it be?
It was a trap.

518
00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:51.465
Skye's crystal was stolen.

519
00:43:52.199 --> 00:43:53.033
Oh.

520
00:43:53.066 --> 00:43:55.536
So, really, really not good.

521
00:44:11.618 --> 00:44:14.856
Hey, Skye. You doing okay?

522
00:44:14.889 --> 00:44:17.724
I can't believe
I lost my crystal.

523
00:44:17.758 --> 00:44:20.294
It could have happened
to any one of us.

524
00:44:20.327 --> 00:44:24.097
But it didn't.
It happened to me.

525
00:44:28.469 --> 00:44:31.738
When I was born,
I was the runt
of the litter.

526
00:44:31.772 --> 00:44:33.207
Do you know
what that means?

527
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.309
That you were
the smallest?

528
00:44:35.342 --> 00:44:38.178
The smallest
and the weakest.

529
00:44:49.289 --> 00:44:51.391
<i>It's not easy</i>
<i>being the smallest.</i>

530
00:44:54.863 --> 00:44:58.232
<i>You learn pretty early on</i>
<i>that everything's gonna be</i>
<i>harder for you.</i>

531
00:45:15.282 --> 00:45:18.652
<i>When you're the smallest,</i>
<i>you're always picked last.</i>

532
00:45:24.091 --> 00:45:26.928
<i>And sometimes</i>
<i>you're never picked at all.</i>

533
00:45:42.776 --> 00:45:46.680
<i>Eventually,</i>
<i>I realized that</i>
<i>if I wanted a better life,</i>

534
00:45:46.713 --> 00:45:49.182
<i>I needed to take matters</i>
<i>into my own hands.</i>

535
00:46:06.868 --> 00:46:08.635
No! Come back!

536
00:46:37.598 --> 00:46:40.100
I've got you. It's okay.

537
00:46:41.869 --> 00:46:43.470
Let's get you
out of the cold.

538
00:46:51.079 --> 00:46:55.817
I shouldn't even be in
the PAW Patrol. Ryder didn't
want another pup.

539
00:46:55.850 --> 00:46:59.353
And if he did,
he sure wouldn't have picked
one as small as me.

540
00:47:00.021 --> 00:47:01.588
I had no idea.

541
00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:06.393
When I had superpowers,
for the first time in my life

542
00:47:06.426 --> 00:47:09.396
I didn't feel
like the smallest
and the weakest.

543
00:47:11.198 --> 00:47:13.767
I'd do anything
to get that crystal back.

544
00:47:27.347 --> 00:47:30.684
Amazing.
That's your best time yet!

545
00:47:30.717 --> 00:47:33.453
Hey, Liberty.
Can I talk to you
for a second?

546
00:47:34.354 --> 00:47:36.657
Okay, puffballs, take five.

547
00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:39.526
Better yet, take zero.
Do some push-ups.

548
00:47:44.464 --> 00:47:48.735
I'm telling you, Ryder,
these puffballs
are the real deal.

549
00:47:48.769 --> 00:47:52.907
Liberty, we've got to end
the Junior Patroller program.

550
00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:55.442
What?
It's too dangerous.

551
00:47:55.475 --> 00:47:58.079
Skye's superpowers have fallen
into the wrong hands,

552
00:47:58.112 --> 00:48:00.882
and we have no idea
what's coming.

553
00:48:00.915 --> 00:48:02.783
But the puffballs can help.

554
00:48:02.817 --> 00:48:04.484
Sure, they're little,
but I've heard you say,

555
00:48:04.518 --> 00:48:08.288
"No pup's too small,"
like, a million times.

556
00:48:08.321 --> 00:48:11.291
I know the Junior Patrollers
mean the world to you,

557
00:48:11.324 --> 00:48:14.294
but for now,
we need to keep them safe.

558
00:48:14.327 --> 00:48:17.131
That means we need
to send them home.

559
00:48:17.165 --> 00:48:19.499
Do you want to tell them
or should I?

560
00:48:20.467 --> 00:48:22.202
Tell us what?

561
00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:30.477
Nano, Mini, Tot,
I've got some tough news.

562
00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:32.947
I'm ending
the Junior Patroller program.

563
00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:34.281
What?

564
00:48:34.314 --> 00:48:36.450
- No.
- I'm sorry.

565
00:48:36.483 --> 00:48:39.821
Hopefully, we can
start it again when
things are safe.

566
00:48:40.454 --> 00:48:42.355
When is that gonna be?

567
00:48:43.858 --> 00:48:44.992
I don't know.

568
00:49:02.342 --> 00:49:06.848
Ryder, I'm sorry
I lost my crystal.

569
00:49:06.881 --> 00:49:11.485
It's not your fault.
I never should have
sent you up there alone.

570
00:49:11.518 --> 00:49:12.954
I just keep thinking,

571
00:49:12.987 --> 00:49:16.623
if I wasn't so small,
I could've stopped them
from taking it.

572
00:49:16.656 --> 00:49:19.659
Don't be so hard on yourself.
We're gonna get it back.

573
00:49:19.693 --> 00:49:22.729
I've set the computer to scan
the city sector by sector,

574
00:49:22.763 --> 00:49:25.298
looking for the energy
signature of the crystal.

575
00:49:25.332 --> 00:49:28.335
Just say the word,
I'm ready to go.

576
00:49:28.368 --> 00:49:32.472
Skye, I'm gonna need
you to stay behind
on this mission.

577
00:49:32.506 --> 00:49:33.540
What?

578
00:49:33.573 --> 00:49:35.742
You don't have
superpowers anymore.

579
00:49:36.343 --> 00:49:39.613
But I have to do something.

580
00:49:39.646 --> 00:49:42.315
My job is to keep you safe.

581
00:49:42.349 --> 00:49:45.418
Until we get
that crystal back,
I need you to stay here.

582
00:49:45.452 --> 00:49:47.687
That's not fair.

583
00:49:47.721 --> 00:49:50.892
I'm sorry, Skye.
But my decision is final.

584
00:49:51.826 --> 00:49:53.360
Try and get some rest.

585
00:50:20.054 --> 00:50:21.189
Finally.

586
00:50:22.322 --> 00:50:24.691
I wonder what
my superpower will be.

587
00:50:24.724 --> 00:50:25.759
Ooh!

588
00:50:25.792 --> 00:50:27.929
Ow!
Don't touch.

589
00:50:33.134 --> 00:50:35.002
Ooh!

590
00:50:35.036 --> 00:50:36.103
It tingles.

591
00:50:38.638 --> 00:50:42.043
I have the power
to control electricity.

592
00:50:46.113 --> 00:50:49.783
For someone who hates
being called a mad scientist,

593
00:50:49.817 --> 00:50:52.519
this is not helping
your image!

594
00:50:54.554 --> 00:50:56.824
I'm just gonna
stand over here.

595
00:50:58.692 --> 00:51:03.430
This is incredible!
I can feel the energy
surging through me!

596
00:51:07.134 --> 00:51:08.269
Stop that!

597
00:51:08.302 --> 00:51:11.806
The static electricity
is ruining my moustache.

598
00:51:13.007 --> 00:51:16.143
And look what it's done
to the kitties!

599
00:51:16.177 --> 00:51:20.147
The problem with
the Meteor Magnet was
it never had enough power.

600
00:51:20.181 --> 00:51:21.648
But now look at me.

601
00:51:21.681 --> 00:51:23.483
I just need to make
a few modifications,

602
00:51:23.516 --> 00:51:26.287
and I can give it
all the power it needs.

603
00:51:27.787 --> 00:51:31.791
I'll finally be able to catch
all the meteors I want!

604
00:51:31.826 --> 00:51:34.862
Why on earth do you need
more meteors?

605
00:51:34.896 --> 00:51:37.497
You saw what kind of power
was in the first one.

606
00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:39.399
Who knows what else
is out there?

607
00:51:47.375 --> 00:51:49.010
<i>Energy signature detected.</i>

608
00:51:49.676 --> 00:51:51.345
<i>Energy signature detected.</i>

609
00:51:51.379 --> 00:51:53.446
My crystal.

610
00:52:06.426 --> 00:52:10.865
If I'm gonna get
my crystal back, I'm gonna
need all the power I can get.

611
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:37.858
That's all of them.

612
00:52:37.892 --> 00:52:40.727
I'll have these crystals
back before anyone knows
they're gone.

613
00:53:02.083 --> 00:53:05.485
Gotcha. Switching engines
to stealth mode.

614
00:54:19.726 --> 00:54:20.961
Oh, no, you don't!

615
00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.301
Ta-ta.

616
00:54:29.336 --> 00:54:30.603
Get back here!

617
00:54:41.849 --> 00:54:44.118
Is that really as fast
as you can go?

618
00:54:53.327 --> 00:54:57.131
Oh, do you need me
to slow down so you
can keep up, little pup?

619
00:55:08.476 --> 00:55:09.676
Oh!

620
00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:17.485
You're so predictable.
Let me out of here!

621
00:55:17.518 --> 00:55:20.221
Not so super inside
a force field, are you?

622
00:55:26.894 --> 00:55:28.728
Don't feel bad
for losing.

623
00:55:28.761 --> 00:55:32.333
People have been
underestimating me
my entire life.

624
00:55:34.602 --> 00:55:36.270
Thanks for the crystals,
though.

625
00:55:38.205 --> 00:55:39.540
No!

626
00:55:48.715 --> 00:55:51.819
Time to put all of
this power to work!

627
00:55:52.586 --> 00:55:53.621
Ha!

628
00:56:20.581 --> 00:56:22.049
This is incredible!

629
00:56:22.082 --> 00:56:25.119
I can reach further into space
than ever before.

630
00:56:25.152 --> 00:56:27.720
Stop! What you're doing
is dangerous.

631
00:56:27.754 --> 00:56:29.223
People could get hurt.

632
00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:36.964
And why should I care
about other people?
They never cared about me.

633
00:56:36.997 --> 00:56:39.200
No matter how smart I was,

634
00:56:39.233 --> 00:56:44.104
they laughed at me
and called me a mad scientist.

635
00:56:44.138 --> 00:56:46.840
So, I took matters
into my own hands.

636
00:56:46.874 --> 00:56:49.143
I promised myself
I'd never let anyone

637
00:56:49.176 --> 00:56:54.747
make me feel small
and insignificant ever again.

638
00:56:54.781 --> 00:56:57.284
I'm sorry that
happened to you.

639
00:56:57.318 --> 00:57:00.354
Oh, what would you
know about anything?
You're just a dog.

640
00:57:02.256 --> 00:57:06.327
I know what
it's like to feel small
and insignificant.

641
00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:11.265
Like you have to work
twice as hard as everyone else
just to prove you belong.

642
00:57:11.298 --> 00:57:14.835
That's why I risked everything
to get my crystal back.

643
00:57:14.868 --> 00:57:18.339
But all I did
was make things worse.

644
00:57:18.372 --> 00:57:21.175
Turns out I am too small
to make a difference.

645
00:57:25.913 --> 00:57:28.716
Ooh!

646
00:57:28.748 --> 00:57:31.986
That was good. I know
what you're trying to do.

647
00:57:32.019 --> 00:57:36.423
We have a little
bonding moment,
I get all soft and blubbery,

648
00:57:36.457 --> 00:57:39.093
then I have a change of heart
and let you go?

649
00:57:39.126 --> 00:57:40.594
Well, it's never gonna happen!

650
00:57:41.729 --> 00:57:44.898
Who are you talking to?
Ooh, is that Skye?

651
00:57:45.499 --> 00:57:47.067
Humdinger.

652
00:57:47.101 --> 00:57:49.870
She was kind enough
to bring me the rest
of the crystals.

653
00:57:49.903 --> 00:57:51.438
Aren't they beautiful?

654
00:57:51.472 --> 00:57:55.843
Now remember, we had a deal.
One of those crystals is mine.

655
00:57:55.876 --> 00:57:57.945
Ugh! Fine.
A deal's a deal.

656
00:57:58.479 --> 00:58:00.214
Oh! Oh! Ah!

657
00:58:01.448 --> 00:58:03.584
Oh, my goodness.
I can talk!

658
00:58:04.852 --> 00:58:06.754
I have so much to say!

659
00:58:06.786 --> 00:58:08.255
Give me that crystal!

660
00:58:09.923 --> 00:58:13.327
How do I turn this thing on?
Come on, superpowers.

661
00:58:14.194 --> 00:58:15.929
Ahhh!

662
00:58:16.997 --> 00:58:18.032
Wow!

663
00:58:18.065 --> 00:58:19.099
Oh!

664
00:58:19.133 --> 00:58:20.167
Oh!

665
00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.235
Oh!

666
00:58:32.546 --> 00:58:34.415
Would you look at that?

667
00:58:37.084 --> 00:58:41.288
Ooh, I always
knew I'd make it big
in Adventure City.

668
00:58:41.322 --> 00:58:45.459
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to pay a visit
to the PAW Patrol.

669
00:58:45.492 --> 00:58:49.363
Those pups and I have got some
unfinished business.

670
00:58:52.499 --> 00:58:53.567
Oh, no.

671
00:58:57.037 --> 00:58:59.707
Ryder! Ryder! Ryder!

672
00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:02.409
Skye's gone.
She took the crystals!

673
00:59:02.443 --> 00:59:03.544
What?

674
00:59:09.416 --> 00:59:11.919
Skye, this is Ryder. Come in.

675
00:59:11.952 --> 00:59:14.288
Skye, this is Ryder.
Do you read me?

676
00:59:18.959 --> 00:59:21.562
The computer found
the missing crystal.

677
00:59:21.595 --> 00:59:23.197
She must've gone after it.

678
00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:24.598
Oh, no.

679
00:59:24.631 --> 00:59:26.667
Come on, pups.
Skye needs our help.

680
00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:31.238
How are we supposed
to help Skye if we don't
have our superpowers?

681
00:59:31.271 --> 00:59:33.640
Looks like we're doing this
the old-fashioned way.

682
00:59:33.674 --> 00:59:35.309
Then I'm coming with you.

683
00:59:45.552 --> 00:59:46.553
What was that?

684
00:59:50.057 --> 00:59:52.393
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

685
00:59:54.161 --> 00:59:55.596
Earthquake!

686
00:59:56.697 --> 00:59:58.432
I don't think
that's an earthquake.

687
01:00:00.934 --> 01:00:02.102
Well, well, well.

688
01:00:02.136 --> 01:00:05.606
If it isn't my old friends,
the PAW Patrol.

689
01:00:06.273 --> 01:00:07.207
Humdinger.

690
01:00:07.241 --> 01:00:09.343
He looks different
than I remember.

691
01:00:10.444 --> 01:00:11.512
I'm stuck!

692
01:00:17.852 --> 01:00:19.420
- Gotcha.
- Go!

693
01:00:23.791 --> 01:00:25.759
Spread out
and don't get stepped on.

694
01:00:30.097 --> 01:00:32.533
Hold still
so I can squash you.

695
01:00:35.702 --> 01:00:36.871
Get out of the road!

696
01:00:38.705 --> 01:00:43.210
What kind of heartless monster
steps on an ice cream truck?

697
01:00:48.015 --> 01:00:51.652
Ah, there's nothing better
than a day at the salon.

698
01:00:55.255 --> 01:00:56.925
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

699
01:00:56.957 --> 01:00:58.625
Arf! Sidecar!

700
01:01:04.598 --> 01:01:05.599
Hey!

701
01:01:11.472 --> 01:01:14.876
Hey, I know you.
You're in the PAW Patrol.

702
01:01:14.909 --> 01:01:16.543
I was thinking
maybe I should join.

703
01:01:16.577 --> 01:01:19.346
I mean, not to do
the rescues or anything,
obviously,

704
01:01:19.379 --> 01:01:21.315
but, like,
your social media
or whatever.

705
01:01:21.348 --> 01:01:23.350
Hang on!

706
01:01:30.691 --> 01:01:32.493
Sorry about that!

707
01:01:32.526 --> 01:01:35.362
On second thought,
who needs a job?

708
01:01:35.395 --> 01:01:36.630
Ew!

709
01:01:36.663 --> 01:01:38.765
You're not
getting away that easy.

710
01:01:38.799 --> 01:01:40.000
Ugh!

711
01:01:41.034 --> 01:01:42.336
Get back here!

712
01:01:49.076 --> 01:01:50.744
It's a dead end!

713
01:01:50.777 --> 01:01:52.012
Turn around!

714
01:01:57.551 --> 01:02:02.022
Looks like it's the end
of the road, PAW Patrol.

715
01:02:02.055 --> 01:02:03.090
What do we do?

716
01:02:03.123 --> 01:02:05.225
I don't know.
We're trapped!

717
01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:14.268
Junior Patrol is on a roll!

718
01:02:14.301 --> 01:02:16.503
It's the Junior Patrollers!

719
01:02:24.444 --> 01:02:25.312
Ahhh!

720
01:02:25.345 --> 01:02:27.414
What is that?
Get it off! Get it off!

721
01:02:32.352 --> 01:02:34.054
Operation Allergies.

722
01:02:34.087 --> 01:02:35.155
Go!

723
01:02:36.657 --> 01:02:39.092
Ah... Ah... Ah...

724
01:02:39.693 --> 01:02:41.194
Ah... Ah...

725
01:02:41.228 --> 01:02:42.931
He's gonna blow!

726
01:02:55.043 --> 01:02:57.578
Marshall, the crystal's
in his jacket pocket!

727
01:02:57.611 --> 01:02:58.645
I'm on it.

728
01:03:05.586 --> 01:03:07.554
- Got it.
- Oh, no, you don't!

729
01:03:07.588 --> 01:03:09.057
Marshall!

730
01:03:09.089 --> 01:03:12.559
Nobody messes
with Giant Humdinger.

731
01:03:14.062 --> 01:03:15.395
Ow!

732
01:03:15.429 --> 01:03:18.967
If you mess with the fire pup,
you're gonna get burned.

733
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.802
Ooh, that's a hot one-liner.

734
01:03:21.836 --> 01:03:22.837
He's shrinking!

735
01:03:33.547 --> 01:03:34.548
Ahhh!

736
01:03:36.583 --> 01:03:38.485
Whoa! Whoa!

737
01:03:41.188 --> 01:03:43.958
Humdinger,
you're going back to jail.

738
01:03:43.992 --> 01:03:46.760
Oh, not again.

739
01:03:48.795 --> 01:03:53.166
That's what I'm talking about.
Lean, mean, fluffy little
rescue machines.

740
01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:56.670
Hop in, puffballs.
You ride with me.

741
01:04:01.308 --> 01:04:05.212
Nice work, Marshall.
Let's take that crystal
and go get Skye.

742
01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:24.498
So many meteors,
so little time.

743
01:04:24.531 --> 01:04:25.532
Ooh!

744
01:04:37.678 --> 01:04:40.915
Can't you read?
The sign says "keep out"!

745
01:04:43.617 --> 01:04:45.686
Ugh!

746
01:05:00.068 --> 01:05:01.601
Hello!

747
01:05:01.635 --> 01:05:04.604
We're going door to door
selling Pup Club cookies.

748
01:05:04.638 --> 01:05:08.241
Can we interest you
in a sweet and tasty treat?

749
01:05:08.275 --> 01:05:10.277
I'm listening.
What do you got?

750
01:05:13.014 --> 01:05:16.550
Vance is distracted
at the door.
Zuma, you're up.

751
01:05:17.151 --> 01:05:18.820
Aye-aye, Ryder, sir.

752
01:05:21.288 --> 01:05:24.624
We got plain,
sprinkles, caramel...

753
01:05:28.528 --> 01:05:30.797
- No. No. Pass.
- Spicy ginger...

754
01:05:30.832 --> 01:05:31.833
Ooh!

755
01:05:33.034 --> 01:05:34.234
Surf's up.

756
01:05:47.581 --> 01:05:51.518
So, we can't eat
chocolate, but we'll take
your word for it.

757
01:05:51.551 --> 01:05:53.054
We'll take your order now,

758
01:05:53.087 --> 01:05:56.523
and you will get your cookies
in six to eight weeks.

759
01:05:57.657 --> 01:05:59.259
That seems
like a long time.

760
01:06:01.461 --> 01:06:05.365
Skye? Skye? Where are you?

761
01:06:05.799 --> 01:06:06.834
Zuma?

762
01:06:08.735 --> 01:06:12.974
Oh, it's good to see you.
Time to bust out of here.

763
01:06:16.777 --> 01:06:18.311
Power paws.

764
01:06:21.782 --> 01:06:24.451
Oh, I don't think so.

765
01:06:32.193 --> 01:06:37.430
Only one of you has powers!
Ha! You're no match for me!

766
01:06:40.034 --> 01:06:41.535
We're a team.

767
01:06:41.568 --> 01:06:44.437
When you go up
against one of us,
you go up against all of us.

768
01:06:44.471 --> 01:06:46.040
Fine. Have it your way.

769
01:06:47.241 --> 01:06:49.576
Chase!
Got it.

770
01:06:49.609 --> 01:06:50.644
Marshall!

771
01:07:04.058 --> 01:07:05.092
Coming in hot!

772
01:07:22.676 --> 01:07:23.677
Rocky!

773
01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:27.714
Look out!

774
01:07:33.753 --> 01:07:36.090
Keep your hands off
our vehicles.

775
01:07:36.123 --> 01:07:37.925
You tell her, Rocky!

776
01:07:39.626 --> 01:07:40.627
Rubble!

777
01:07:43.064 --> 01:07:44.698
Power paws!

778
01:07:54.976 --> 01:07:56.509
Skye!
On it.

779
01:07:56.978 --> 01:07:58.112
Oh, no, you don't.

780
01:08:01.148 --> 01:08:02.149
Chase!

781
01:08:22.203 --> 01:08:24.338
Look at me.

782
01:08:24.372 --> 01:08:26.506
I'm... I'm stretchy!

783
01:08:26.539 --> 01:08:30.510
That's my superpower!
I'm elastic and fantastic.

784
01:08:30.543 --> 01:08:32.646
Uh, Liberty?

785
01:08:32.679 --> 01:08:35.182
Can you please
get us out of here?
No problem.

786
01:08:39.619 --> 01:08:41.289
Nice catch, Liberty!

787
01:08:41.322 --> 01:08:45.492
I've been trying
to be more flexible,
but this is ridiculous.

788
01:08:45.525 --> 01:08:48.528
All right, puppies,
playtime's over!

789
01:08:48.561 --> 01:08:50.697
Give me back
that crystal!

790
01:08:51.832 --> 01:08:52.833
Zuma!

791
01:09:01.741 --> 01:09:04.744
Where'd he go?
Over here, dude!

792
01:09:05.612 --> 01:09:07.480
You got to be
faster than that.

793
01:09:09.283 --> 01:09:11.152
You can't hide forever!

794
01:09:16.057 --> 01:09:17.158
Huh?

795
01:09:24.932 --> 01:09:27.534
These crystals
belong to us, dude.

796
01:09:28.735 --> 01:09:29.803
No!

797
01:09:44.385 --> 01:09:48.122
It's time to shut down
that Meteor Magnet
once and for all.

798
01:09:49.957 --> 01:09:53.660
Hey, Rubble.
Want to go for a ride?

799
01:09:53.693 --> 01:09:55.997
Teamwork makes
the dream work.

800
01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:02.635
No! No! Stop!
What are you doing?
Fire!

801
01:10:05.172 --> 01:10:06.273
No!

802
01:10:11.012 --> 01:10:13.848
Oh, yeah.
How do you like me now?

803
01:10:18.486 --> 01:10:21.688
Victoria Vance,
you are under arrest.

804
01:10:22.156 --> 01:10:23.391
Ooh!

805
01:10:23.424 --> 01:10:26.127
You're in big trouble!

806
01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:27.862
You'll have to
catch me first!

807
01:10:28.661 --> 01:10:30.297
Where do you think
you're going?

808
01:10:38.472 --> 01:10:41.242
You mangy mutts
think you're so smart,

809
01:10:41.275 --> 01:10:45.379
but those meteors
are coming down whether
you like it or not.

810
01:10:46.713 --> 01:10:48.115
She's telling the truth.

811
01:10:48.149 --> 01:10:50.818
There's hundreds of meteors
heading straight for the city.

812
01:10:51.886 --> 01:10:54.922
What have you done?
What can I say?

813
01:10:54.955 --> 01:10:58.259
I guess I am a mad scientist.

814
01:11:01.661 --> 01:11:04.231
Finally, she admits it.

815
01:11:04.265 --> 01:11:06.566
Skye, I need you
to fly up there

816
01:11:06.599 --> 01:11:10.137
and destroy as many
of those meteors as you can.

817
01:11:10.171 --> 01:11:13.874
You still believe in me after
everything that's happened?

818
01:11:13.908 --> 01:11:16.776
I've always believed
in you, Skye.

819
01:11:16.811 --> 01:11:20.047
You're the reason I started
saying, "No pup's too small."

820
01:11:22.083 --> 01:11:24.651
I'll give it
everything I got, Ryder.

821
01:11:25.986 --> 01:11:27.388
Wait.

822
01:11:27.421 --> 01:11:30.124
If you're going up
against those meteors,

823
01:11:30.157 --> 01:11:32.659
you better take
all the power you can get.

824
01:11:49.243 --> 01:11:50.845
We believe in you, Skye.

825
01:11:51.778 --> 01:11:53.280
I won't let you down.

826
01:11:58.252 --> 01:12:00.054
Let's take to the sky.

827
01:12:02.789 --> 01:12:06.393
Okay, pups, we've got a city
to evacuate. Let's move!

828
01:12:28.115 --> 01:12:29.183
Where are you?

829
01:12:32.752 --> 01:12:34.654
There you are.

830
01:12:34.687 --> 01:12:36.957
Activating targeting computer.

831
01:12:41.595 --> 01:12:42.963
Let's do this.

832
01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.201
Fire!

833
01:13:04.552 --> 01:13:06.287
Time to turn and burn.

834
01:13:24.972 --> 01:13:26.974
Oh!

835
01:13:27.007 --> 01:13:27.975
I'm hit!

836
01:13:28.008 --> 01:13:30.010
<i>Skye, are you okay?</i>

837
01:13:30.044 --> 01:13:32.913
I'm fine, but I'm gonna
have to ditch my jet.

838
01:13:43.591 --> 01:13:46.260
All right, space rocks,
what do you got?

839
01:14:05.713 --> 01:14:08.682
<i>There are meteors headed</i>
<i>directly for Adventure City.</i>

840
01:14:08.716 --> 01:14:13.687
<i>Evacuate the area immediately.</i>
<i>I repeat, evacuate the area!</i>

841
01:14:13.721 --> 01:14:17.992
Keep moving, everybody.
Only bring what's
absolutely necessary!

842
01:14:19.193 --> 01:14:20.261
Come on, Skye.

843
01:14:38.178 --> 01:14:40.648
That's all of them.
The sky is clear.

844
01:14:42.782 --> 01:14:44.151
No, it's not.

845
01:14:44.184 --> 01:14:47.054
Skye, there's
a huge meteor incoming.

846
01:14:48.956 --> 01:14:50.357
I don't see anything.

847
01:14:51.725 --> 01:14:52.860
Wait a second.

848
01:15:00.434 --> 01:15:01.435
Oh, no.

849
01:15:06.907 --> 01:15:09.410
Skye, you've got
to get out of there!

850
01:15:12.079 --> 01:15:15.349
I can't do that, Ryder.
I have to try.

851
01:15:15.382 --> 01:15:18.819
<i>Save yourself, Skye!</i>
<i>That meteor's too big!</i>

852
01:15:25.726 --> 01:15:26.994
No pup's too small.

853
01:15:52.686 --> 01:15:54.455
No pup's too small!

854
01:16:00.728 --> 01:16:02.363
No pup's too small!

855
01:16:14.942 --> 01:16:16.343
Skye!

856
01:16:38.198 --> 01:16:39.400
Skye!

857
01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:41.135
Skye!

858
01:16:41.168 --> 01:16:42.269
Skye!

859
01:16:43.771 --> 01:16:44.806
Skye!

860
01:17:04.826 --> 01:17:06.427
Wait. What's that?

861
01:17:17.571 --> 01:17:19.239
Whoa!

862
01:17:22.811 --> 01:17:24.311
You see that right there?

863
01:17:24.344 --> 01:17:26.079
That's why she's
my favorite pup.

864
01:17:27.981 --> 01:17:29.483
Yeah, Skye!

865
01:17:29.516 --> 01:17:31.051
Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

866
01:17:31.084 --> 01:17:33.654
That was amazing.

867
01:17:34.621 --> 01:17:36.290
I'm so proud of you, Skye.

868
01:17:36.323 --> 01:17:38.559
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

869
01:17:40.427 --> 01:17:44.064
I don't believe it.
She did it. Yeah!

870
01:17:47.401 --> 01:17:48.569
Whoo-hoo!

871
01:17:48.602 --> 01:17:50.771
Way to go,
PAW Patrol!

872
01:17:56.410 --> 01:17:59.646
Give it up for Skye
and the Mighty Pups!

873
01:18:17.431 --> 01:18:21.368
<i>We are the Mighty Pups,</i>
<i>defenders of Adventure City</i>

874
01:18:21.401 --> 01:18:24.371
<i>and guardians of all</i>
<i>that's good in the world.</i>

875
01:18:24.404 --> 01:18:26.340
<i>With these superpowers</i>
<i>comes a duty</i>

876
01:18:26.373 --> 01:18:29.911
<i>to protect all those</i>
<i>who need our help.</i>

877
01:18:29.944 --> 01:18:32.112
<i>Our promise is to always</i>
<i>do what's right</i>

878
01:18:32.145 --> 01:18:34.615
<i>and stop at nothing</i>
<i>to keep the world safe.</i>

879
01:18:35.315 --> 01:18:37.518
<i>Because even the smallest pup</i>

880
01:18:41.288 --> 01:18:43.290
<i>can make</i>
<i>the biggest difference.</i>

881
01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.862
No rescue's too big...

882
01:18:49.029 --> 01:18:50.497
No pup's too small.
