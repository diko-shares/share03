1
00:01:31.726 --> 00:01:33.226
That was a long one.

2
00:01:37.632 --> 00:01:42.235
I don't suppose you can tell me
how it looks, can you?

3
00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:45.339
Unfortunately,
I'm just the technician.

4
00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:47.809
Your doctor will have
your results tomorrow.

5
00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:51.613
-Would you like some help to...
-Thank you very much.

6
00:01:52.547 --> 00:01:53.648
You're very kind.

7
00:02:02.824 --> 00:02:04.626
I mean, yeah,

8
00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.962
the cancer has brought
grief and pain

9
00:02:07.996 --> 00:02:11.264
and fear into my every
waking moment.

10
00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:16.571
Okay, Chris.
Today is a gift.

11
00:02:16.604 --> 00:02:19.841
That's why they call it
the present.

12
00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:23.077
Anyone else?

13
00:02:24.846 --> 00:02:26.547
Henry Kessler.

14
00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:28.016
Please.

15
00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.685
Stage four pancreatic.

16
00:02:31.218 --> 00:02:32.386
Terminal.

17
00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:36.557
That's what they tell me,
anyway, but...

18
00:02:39.527 --> 00:02:41.596
I'm gonna fight this
'til the end.

19
00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:47.669
How much time do I have?

20
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.439
A year?

21
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.176
Months at best.

22
00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.446
I still have a lot of work
that needs to be done.

23
00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:00.515
My advice?

24
00:03:02.016 --> 00:03:03.051
Retire.

25
00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.254
You know, at this stage,

26
00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:09.824
everyone always searches
for a way out.

27
00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:13.895
But sometimes,
those who accept their fate,

28
00:03:13.928 --> 00:03:15.029
have an easier time.

29
00:03:15.063 --> 00:03:16.698
Easier time? What?

30
00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.399
Dying?

31
00:03:21.736 --> 00:03:26.641
So, your advice to me
is to die easy?

32
00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:44.719
Help! Hey! Help! Help, please!

33
00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:57.231
<i>I'd like to play a game.</i>

34
00:04:57.265 --> 00:05:01.569
<i>Perhaps one that addresses</i>
<i>those sticky fingers of yours.</i>

35
00:05:02.904 --> 00:05:07.775
<i>I've had my eyes on you</i>
<i>and I do not like what I see.</i>

36
00:05:09.177 --> 00:05:12.412
<i>Your job as a custodian</i>
<i>is a noble one.</i>

37
00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:15.216
<i>Sanitizing and sterilizing</i>
<i>the hospital...</i>

38
00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:18.485
<i>...helping patients</i>
<i>avoid sickness.</i>

39
00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:20.420
<i>But there is</i>
<i>a sickness inside you</i>

40
00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:22.056
<i>that needs to be excised.</i>

41
00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:25.660
<i>You have the ability</i>
<i>to not only save</i>

42
00:05:25.693 --> 00:05:28.196
<i>your soul today,</i>
<i>but your sight.</i>

43
00:05:29.697 --> 00:05:32.099
<i>All you have to do is</i>
<i>click the dial</i>

44
00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:34.168
<i>across the five positions</i>

45
00:05:34.202 --> 00:05:37.171
<i>and you will live to see</i>
<i>another day.</i>

46
00:05:37.205 --> 00:05:39.339
<i>You have 60 seconds.</i>

47
00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:40.575
Help, please!

48
00:05:46.547 --> 00:05:49.449
Help me! Please, please,
please. Help. Help!

49
00:06:09.136 --> 00:06:11.505
I can't! I can't, I can't!

50
00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:13.774
Please, no!

51
00:06:24.785 --> 00:06:26.386
Fuck you!

52
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.430
Good choice.

53
00:07:31.085 --> 00:07:32.853
Here you go, sir.

54
00:07:32.887 --> 00:07:33.921
Thank you.

55
00:07:47.735 --> 00:07:50.571
Can I get
a blueberry scone, please?

56
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.175
Oh, they look good.

57
00:07:55.977 --> 00:07:56.978
Thank you.

58
00:08:01.282 --> 00:08:02.482
Henry.

59
00:08:05.386 --> 00:08:08.055
We were in the same
cancer support group.

60
00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:10.057
John Kramer.

61
00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:11.692
I remember you.

62
00:08:11.726 --> 00:08:13.828
Hey, good to see you.

63
00:08:15.162 --> 00:08:16.197
And you as well.

64
00:08:19.033 --> 00:08:20.267
You look marvelous.

65
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:22.970
Thank you. I... I...
I feel great.

66
00:08:23.004 --> 00:08:25.706
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but you were, uh...

67
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.242
Yeah, stage four pancreatic.

68
00:08:28.275 --> 00:08:30.378
But now, four months later,

69
00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:33.781
I'm in complete remission.

70
00:08:37.318 --> 00:08:38.486
How?

71
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.357
It's a... it's a long story.

72
00:08:43.391 --> 00:08:46.560
I'd love to hear it.

73
00:08:46.594 --> 00:08:48.095
You got a minute to tell me?

74
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.798
Sure. Sure.

75
00:08:56.537 --> 00:08:57.772
So, um,

76
00:08:57.805 --> 00:09:01.575
I read about a doctor,
a specialist of sorts.

77
00:09:01.609 --> 00:09:04.045
A Dr. Finn Pederson.

78
00:09:04.078 --> 00:09:06.647
He offered a treatment

79
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.485
and it is a groundbreaking

80
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.655
drug cocktail
combined with surgery.

81
00:09:20.294 --> 00:09:21.796
It's my war wound.

82
00:09:24.432 --> 00:09:26.767
I know it looks bad,

83
00:09:26.801 --> 00:09:30.204
but it was totally worth it.

84
00:09:30.237 --> 00:09:33.207
Yeah.

85
00:09:34.675 --> 00:09:37.878
-Is it available here?
-No.

86
00:09:37.912 --> 00:09:40.648
No, no, the treatment's not
available in the States.

87
00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:43.784
The, uh, the medication
isn't approved by the FDA.

88
00:09:44.819 --> 00:09:47.154
Hell, it isn't approved
by anybody.

89
00:09:48.456 --> 00:09:51.125
I, um... I haven't
seen them since...

90
00:09:51.892 --> 00:09:53.961
since my treatment in Norway.

91
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:55.830
But...

92
00:10:01.102 --> 00:10:03.270
this link...

93
00:10:05.973 --> 00:10:06.974
is still good.

94
00:10:12.581 --> 00:10:13.781
Hey, John,

95
00:10:15.783 --> 00:10:18.285
good luck, man. Okay?

96
00:10:18.319 --> 00:10:20.855
I'm... I'm rooting for you.

97
00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:23.390
Thank you.

98
00:10:23.424 --> 00:10:24.625
Take care.

99
00:10:42.476 --> 00:10:44.311
Doctor, what exactly is
the procedure?

100
00:10:44.345 --> 00:10:48.048
Well, under the right
circumstances and with
the proper stimuli,

101
00:10:48.082 --> 00:10:50.885
genes can be turned on and
turned off like a light switch.

102
00:10:50.918 --> 00:10:53.187
<i>And you're targeting</i>
<i>the cancer cells?</i>

103
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.788
<i>Exactly.</i>

104
00:10:54.822 --> 00:10:58.392
What we've managed to do is
to create a new cutting-edge
drug cocktail,

105
00:10:58.425 --> 00:10:59.727
along with surgery,

106
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.363
to teach the malignant cells
to switch off.

107
00:11:02.396 --> 00:11:03.864
<i>Fascinating.</i>

108
00:11:04.365 --> 00:11:05.366
Hmm.

109
00:11:17.077 --> 00:11:21.315
<i>My father, Dr. Finn Pederson,</i>
<i>was forced into hiding</i>

110
00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:26.153
<i>by corrupt governments</i>
<i>and their relationship</i>
<i>to big pharma.</i>

111
00:11:26.187 --> 00:11:28.055
Why?

112
00:11:28.088 --> 00:11:32.226
Because my father was
on the cusp of curing
dozens of diseases.

113
00:11:32.259 --> 00:11:36.598
<i>Which means no more need</i>
<i>for lifelong medication.</i>

114
00:11:36.631 --> 00:11:39.300
Can you imagine
what that implies?

115
00:11:41.235 --> 00:11:44.004
Well, the big drug companies
certainly can.

116
00:11:44.038 --> 00:11:48.342
<i>And I'm here to say</i>
<i>that this just cannot stand.</i>

117
00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:52.846
<i>So, while my father</i>
<i>continues to make further</i>
<i>improvements to his formula,</i>

118
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.783
<i>I'm taking his treatment</i>
<i>on the road</i>

119
00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:57.084
<i>for more trials,</i>

120
00:11:57.117 --> 00:12:00.854
to save as many lives
as humanly possible.

121
00:12:33.387 --> 00:12:34.755
Who is this?

122
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:37.659
This is Cecilia Pederson.

123
00:12:37.692 --> 00:12:39.159
Is this John Kramer?

124
00:12:40.094 --> 00:12:41.362
Yes, it is.

125
00:12:41.395 --> 00:12:42.997
<i>Good.</i>

126
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.033
We received the email
with your medical records,
Mr. Kramer.

127
00:12:46.066 --> 00:12:47.636
Thank you for reaching out.

128
00:12:47.669 --> 00:12:51.238
<i>I'm sifting through</i>
<i>potential candidates</i>
<i>for our program.</i>

129
00:12:51.272 --> 00:12:52.741
So, I'm calling you now,

130
00:12:52.773 --> 00:12:55.442
because we have spots opening
for treatment in about
three months.

131
00:13:00.781 --> 00:13:02.216
Mr. Kramer?

132
00:13:02.751 --> 00:13:04.151
Uh, yes, I'm here.

133
00:13:05.553 --> 00:13:07.555
You don't have three months,
do you?

134
00:13:09.691 --> 00:13:11.559
<i>Okay, listen...</i>

135
00:13:11.593 --> 00:13:13.628
I'm currently working in Mexico.

136
00:13:13.662 --> 00:13:16.363
Oslo has become
too difficult for us.

137
00:13:16.397 --> 00:13:18.432
But we have a team
of specialists here

138
00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:21.335
who share our belief
in the Pederson method

139
00:13:21.368 --> 00:13:23.971
and I've gathered
a group of eligible patients

140
00:13:24.004 --> 00:13:26.273
to start treatment
a week from now.

141
00:13:26.307 --> 00:13:28.375
<i>I think I could add</i>
<i>one more spot.</i>

142
00:13:28.976 --> 00:13:30.811
<i>If you're interested.</i>

143
00:13:31.613 --> 00:13:32.980
Yes, I'm interested.

144
00:13:33.782 --> 00:13:34.882
Henry Kessler...

145
00:13:34.915 --> 00:13:36.116
<i>referred me to you.</i>

146
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:40.421
Henry. He's doing well.
I'm so pleased.

147
00:13:41.322 --> 00:13:42.456
I wonder if you could...

148
00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:44.892
could you tell me a little more
about the treatment?

149
00:13:44.925 --> 00:13:46.695
<i>Of course.</i>

150
00:13:46.728 --> 00:13:50.565
It's a two-prong treatment
that uses my father's
Xaxiophenol cocktail.

151
00:13:50.598 --> 00:13:56.370
And in your case, it would be
combined with a cranial surgery
to clear the tumor.

152
00:13:56.403 --> 00:13:59.507
When both are used together,
the results have been stunning.

153
00:13:59.541 --> 00:14:01.776
<i>Over 90% success rate.</i>

154
00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:03.010
<i>I know it's a long trip,</i>

155
00:14:03.043 --> 00:14:06.447
Mr. Kramer,
especially in your condition,

156
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.883
but I want you to know
that we found a very
beautiful location

157
00:14:09.917 --> 00:14:12.554
for our clinic
outside Mexico City.

158
00:14:12.587 --> 00:14:14.221
It's in a
well-off-the-grid area,

159
00:14:14.254 --> 00:14:18.025
in the countryside
where you can have
safety and privacy.

160
00:14:18.058 --> 00:14:22.496
<i>We'll also, of course,</i>
<i>arrange for a trusted</i>
<i>driver at your arrival.</i>

161
00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.098
What date did you have in mind?

162
00:14:24.131 --> 00:14:27.034
The 5th, Friday after next.

163
00:14:27.067 --> 00:14:29.069
I think I could make that.

164
00:14:46.086 --> 00:14:48.188
-J. Kramer? Yeah?
<i>-Si.</i> Yes.

165
00:14:48.222 --> 00:14:50.924
I'm Diego. Welcome to Mexico.

166
00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.528
Allow me, sir. Please. This way.

167
00:14:53.561 --> 00:14:56.296
There you go.

168
00:15:00.167 --> 00:15:01.669
Take a look at that.

169
00:15:01.703 --> 00:15:04.004
That's the Metropolitan
Cathedral.

170
00:15:04.037 --> 00:15:06.907
That's the revolutionary
memorial.

171
00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.309
That's the Angel
of Independence.

172
00:15:09.343 --> 00:15:12.446
Take a look at that.
Isn't it beautiful?

173
00:15:14.415 --> 00:15:15.583
Hey, J.

174
00:15:15.617 --> 00:15:20.087
That, my friend, that's the old
Aztec statue of Tlaloc.

175
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.321
That's where the priests

176
00:15:21.355 --> 00:15:23.223
chop the hearts
out of their subjects

177
00:15:23.257 --> 00:15:24.893
and roll them down the stairs.

178
00:15:26.561 --> 00:15:29.531
Every day, a tourist wants me
to take them here.

179
00:15:29.564 --> 00:15:31.098
Very strange.

180
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:51.586
Hey, J.

181
00:15:51.619 --> 00:15:52.620
You okay?

182
00:16:01.161 --> 00:16:02.530
Get out!

183
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.170
What's your name?

184
00:16:10.738 --> 00:16:12.172
John Kramer.

185
00:16:12.206 --> 00:16:15.777
Lie to me again and I'll empty
this chamber in your eye.

186
00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.212
I'm not lying.
My name is John Kramer.

187
00:16:20.481 --> 00:16:23.183
Not to worry, <i>senor</i>
Kramer, you're fine.

188
00:16:23.217 --> 00:16:26.654
You're safe. Come with me.
Come, come.

189
00:16:26.688 --> 00:16:29.657
Here. Welcome. Watch your head.

190
00:16:55.617 --> 00:16:57.017
Your room.

191
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.586
Here. Come.

192
00:17:01.623 --> 00:17:03.357
It's here. Good luck.

193
00:17:10.264 --> 00:17:11.265
<i>Si?</i>

194
00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:15.737
I am John Kramer.

195
00:17:16.838 --> 00:17:18.038
Come.

196
00:17:28.348 --> 00:17:30.250
I... Gabriela.

197
00:17:40.795 --> 00:17:42.296
<i>Mi familia.</i>

198
00:17:46.668 --> 00:17:47.669
Come.

199
00:17:55.977 --> 00:17:57.845
Sleep. Sleep here.

200
00:17:57.879 --> 00:18:00.080
Dr. Cecilia Pederson?

201
00:18:00.748 --> 00:18:01.783
Ah. <i>Si.</i>

202
00:18:03.216 --> 00:18:07.421
She saved life. My life.

203
00:18:10.223 --> 00:18:12.326
I get. I get now.

204
00:18:26.173 --> 00:18:28.810
Mr. Kramer, welcome.

205
00:18:34.481 --> 00:18:38.920
That was quite a reception
that I got on the way out here.

206
00:18:38.953 --> 00:18:40.588
Oh, our welcome wagon?

207
00:18:41.623 --> 00:18:43.290
I know, I'm sorry.

208
00:18:43.323 --> 00:18:46.828
But we've had to beef up
the security wherever we go.

209
00:18:46.861 --> 00:18:49.797
The big drug companies
are always one step behind

210
00:18:49.831 --> 00:18:54.167
and so we must keep our location
secret from everyone, even you.

211
00:18:55.703 --> 00:18:56.738
Come.

212
00:18:56.771 --> 00:18:58.640
I want you to meet the team.

213
00:19:07.081 --> 00:19:09.182
Yeah?

214
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:14.221
That's Carlos.
Our local football star.

215
00:19:14.254 --> 00:19:16.390
His father is the caretaker.

216
00:19:39.212 --> 00:19:42.684
This used to be
a chemical factory
back in the day.

217
00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.555
Mateo.

218
00:20:21.122 --> 00:20:22.857
Hello, Doctor.

219
00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.424
This is John Kramer.

220
00:20:24.458 --> 00:20:26.661
Very nice to meet you,
Mr. Kramer, and welcome
to our clinic.

221
00:20:26.694 --> 00:20:28.696
You're in very good hands
with us.

222
00:20:29.496 --> 00:20:30.631
Hmm.

223
00:20:30.665 --> 00:20:33.101
Mateo is an anesthesiologist
at Hospital Alto Prado.

224
00:20:33.134 --> 00:20:37.939
He did his residency
at Johns Hopkins and has
worked a lot with my father.

225
00:20:37.972 --> 00:20:39.272
-Yes.
-He'll be helping out

226
00:20:39.306 --> 00:20:40.775
with your surgery tomorrow.

227
00:20:40.808 --> 00:20:42.076
Thank you.

228
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:44.979
-I'll be right here
if you need anything.
-Thank you.

229
00:20:50.383 --> 00:20:52.887
This is Valentina,
one of our nurses.

230
00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.890
She'll be taking some scans
and drawing some blood,

231
00:20:55.923 --> 00:20:59.160
all in preparation for the
injection therapy later today.

232
00:20:59.193 --> 00:21:01.495
Mr. Sears' vitals look good.

233
00:21:01.529 --> 00:21:03.765
He's cleared for release.

234
00:21:03.798 --> 00:21:04.832
Wonderful.

235
00:21:06.333 --> 00:21:08.736
Parker Sears, John Kramer.

236
00:21:11.338 --> 00:21:13.975
Thyroid cancer, advanced. You?

237
00:21:14.008 --> 00:21:15.710
Uh, brain.

238
00:21:16.343 --> 00:21:19.180
Ah. You win.

239
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.987
Sorry, they cut me open
yesterday.

240
00:21:26.821 --> 00:21:29.190
Took out a tumor
the size of my knob.

241
00:21:29.223 --> 00:21:31.491
I'm just about to start
the cocktail.

242
00:21:31.526 --> 00:21:33.528
Mutated natural killer cells.

243
00:21:33.561 --> 00:21:36.164
They're a type of
cytotoxic lymphocyte.

244
00:21:36.197 --> 00:21:37.965
Developed by my father.

245
00:21:39.033 --> 00:21:40.500
Good luck, John.

246
00:21:42.036 --> 00:21:43.805
Thank you.

247
00:21:43.838 --> 00:21:46.774
So, we've arranged
for you to stay at a hotel.

248
00:21:46.808 --> 00:21:47.942
Shall we begin?

249
00:21:54.381 --> 00:21:55.883
Please, don't move.

250
00:22:08.428 --> 00:22:10.865
<i>So, Mr. Kramer...</i>

251
00:22:10.898 --> 00:22:13.901
-What do you do?
Like, for a living?
-John.

252
00:22:14.502 --> 00:22:16.403
Please, call me John.

253
00:22:16.436 --> 00:22:18.573
And what do you do, John?

254
00:22:18.606 --> 00:22:22.677
I've been a civil engineer and
an architect most of my life.

255
00:22:23.311 --> 00:22:24.512
Now, I...

256
00:22:26.413 --> 00:22:27.782
have a few hobbies.

257
00:22:28.783 --> 00:22:29.784
Hmm.

258
00:22:30.383 --> 00:22:31.586
Let me guess.

259
00:22:32.352 --> 00:22:34.354
Classic car renovation.

260
00:22:35.957 --> 00:22:38.159
- No?
- No.

261
00:22:38.192 --> 00:22:39.293
I, uh...

262
00:22:39.327 --> 00:22:42.063
I help people overcome
inner obstacles.

263
00:22:43.531 --> 00:22:46.399
Help them make positive
changes in their lives.

264
00:22:46.968 --> 00:22:48.836
Like a life coach, yeah?

265
00:22:50.004 --> 00:22:51.105
Something like that.

266
00:22:51.906 --> 00:22:53.674
Sounds nice.

267
00:22:53.708 --> 00:22:56.811
I can't think of anything more
important than helping others.

268
00:22:57.979 --> 00:22:59.446
Yeah.

269
00:23:01.616 --> 00:23:03.050
Tequila.

270
00:23:03.084 --> 00:23:04.118
For good luck.

271
00:23:06.721 --> 00:23:08.122
Thank you, Gabriela.

272
00:23:08.956 --> 00:23:09.957
<i>De nada.</i>

273
00:23:11.092 --> 00:23:13.194
It's a local favorite.

274
00:23:13.227 --> 00:23:14.562
You can't drink it now, though.

275
00:23:14.595 --> 00:23:16.097
Not before surgery.

276
00:23:21.434 --> 00:23:24.505
"My sun sets to rise again."

277
00:23:26.574 --> 00:23:28.709
Your sun is rising again, John.

278
00:23:30.978 --> 00:23:32.179
We will make sure of it.

279
00:24:23.631 --> 00:24:25.465
You speak English, Carlos?

280
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.835
<i>Que?</i>

281
00:24:27.868 --> 00:24:30.504
That's about
as good as my Spanish.

282
00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.542
How do you say "pull"?

283
00:24:37.111 --> 00:24:39.246
Pull, pull. Pull.

284
00:24:41.415 --> 00:24:42.616
<i>Jalar.</i>

285
00:24:43.517 --> 00:24:44.719
<i>Jalar.</i>

286
00:24:47.487 --> 00:24:50.157
Excellent. <i>Jalar.</i>

287
00:24:56.496 --> 00:24:57.732
<i>Gracias.</i>

288
00:25:00.568 --> 00:25:03.004
And who performs the surgery?

289
00:25:03.037 --> 00:25:05.072
Dr. Ramone Cortez.

290
00:25:05.106 --> 00:25:07.341
Also at Alto Prado.

291
00:25:07.375 --> 00:25:10.311
He's the best neurosurgeon
in 2,000 miles.

292
00:25:10.344 --> 00:25:13.848
He's the doctor I'd use
if my own family
was on the table.

293
00:25:13.881 --> 00:25:17.118
Now, we'll be performing
an "awake craniotomy."

294
00:25:17.151 --> 00:25:21.022
This means that you'll be
floating in and out
of consciousness...

295
00:25:21.055 --> 00:25:24.425
...so that we can do
function mapping...

296
00:25:24.458 --> 00:25:26.260
<i>This allows us to monitor</i>
<i>your abilities,</i>

297
00:25:26.293 --> 00:25:28.629
<i>so that we don't touch</i>
<i>any part of your brain</i>

298
00:25:28.662 --> 00:25:30.998
<i>that might affect speech</i>
<i>or movement...</i>

299
00:26:07.201 --> 00:26:08.636
Mr. Kramer...

300
00:26:08.669 --> 00:26:10.671
Can you please wiggle
your fingers?

301
00:26:11.472 --> 00:26:14.241
Good. Motor function is clear.

302
00:26:14.275 --> 00:26:15.609
Suction vac, please.

303
00:26:45.139 --> 00:26:47.341
Valentina,
will you move...

304
00:26:49.443 --> 00:26:51.045
Right, right, right.

305
00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:08.796
Okay, great.
We're gonna
put you back to sleep.

306
00:27:08.829 --> 00:27:11.198
I'm gonna count down from ten.

307
00:27:11.232 --> 00:27:12.233
Ten...

308
00:27:13.234 --> 00:27:15.736
nine, eight...

309
00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.873
<i>seven, six...</i>

310
00:27:26.581 --> 00:27:27.781
Hi, there.

311
00:27:29.483 --> 00:27:30.718
You did great.

312
00:27:31.752 --> 00:27:33.721
Where are we?

313
00:27:33.754 --> 00:27:36.390
We're two blocks away
from Mateo's hospital.

314
00:27:36.423 --> 00:27:38.192
In case you need a transfusion.

315
00:27:38.859 --> 00:27:40.194
I got your bloodwork.

316
00:27:45.132 --> 00:27:47.234
Hemoglobin's normal.

317
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:51.372
It all looks good, John.

318
00:27:52.206 --> 00:27:53.407
It all looks good.

319
00:27:55.577 --> 00:27:56.777
Now...

320
00:27:57.546 --> 00:27:59.180
Drink two a day.

321
00:27:59.213 --> 00:28:01.248
One in the morning
and one at night.

322
00:28:01.282 --> 00:28:02.716
Okay.

323
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:04.318
In addition
to my father's treatment,

324
00:28:04.351 --> 00:28:08.189
it contains a painkiller
you'll need for the next
seven days.

325
00:28:09.089 --> 00:28:10.991
And after that,
what happens then?

326
00:28:12.594 --> 00:28:14.295
Your whole life happens then.

327
00:28:20.334 --> 00:28:23.003
I never got a chance
to say goodbye to Gabriela.

328
00:28:23.672 --> 00:28:24.838
Or, any of the others.

329
00:28:24.872 --> 00:28:26.508
I'll send them your best.

330
00:28:26.541 --> 00:28:28.510
Don't get your head wet.

331
00:28:28.543 --> 00:28:29.944
The bandage is anti-bacterial.

332
00:28:29.977 --> 00:28:32.479
It will stave off infection.

333
00:28:32.514 --> 00:28:36.183
Valentina will swing by
to keep an eye on it for you.

334
00:28:36.217 --> 00:28:37.519
Get some rest now, John.

335
00:28:37.552 --> 00:28:38.752
Okay.

336
00:28:40.689 --> 00:28:42.856
Dr. Pederson,
just so you know...

337
00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:45.426
I'll wire the second half
of the payment tomorrow morning.

338
00:28:46.327 --> 00:28:47.328
Thank you, John.

339
00:28:48.896 --> 00:28:50.831
Have a good life, John.

340
00:28:52.266 --> 00:28:55.035
A long, good life.

341
00:30:01.402 --> 00:30:03.170
Do you have a gift card?

342
00:30:03.203 --> 00:30:06.106
It's for a friend. Thank you.

343
00:30:46.648 --> 00:30:48.849
<i>Un momento, por favor.</i>

344
00:31:05.899 --> 00:31:07.101
Hello?

345
00:31:10.904 --> 00:31:12.206
Gabriela?

346
00:32:24.445 --> 00:32:26.079
<i>Hello, and welcome</i>

347
00:32:26.113 --> 00:32:27.214
<i>to section five</i>

348
00:32:27.247 --> 00:32:29.149
<i>in our neurosurgery series.</i>

00:32:36.457 --> 00:32:39.527

353
00:32:47.067 --> 00:32:48.703
Right, right, right.

354
00:33:28.442 --> 00:33:30.110
<i>Have a good life, John.</i>

355
00:33:30.143 --> 00:33:32.514
<i>A long, good life.</i>

356
00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.930
Hey, guys.

357
00:33:48.963 --> 00:33:53.333
Did you know that when
the Aztecs roll the heart
of their victim down the stairs

358
00:33:53.367 --> 00:33:57.037
people will take them home
and display them like ornaments?

359
00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:59.741
In their fucking houses.
Yeah.

360
00:33:59.774 --> 00:34:03.511
Nice.
Yes, sir,
welcome to Mexico.

361
00:34:04.211 --> 00:34:07.782
Okay, so here we are.

362
00:34:08.983 --> 00:34:11.619
This is the Tlaloc statue.
Okay?

363
00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.923
Huh. Thank you, man.
Have a good one.

364
00:34:14.956 --> 00:34:16.390
Of course, man.
Thanks.

365
00:34:25.967 --> 00:34:27.167
Hello.

366
00:34:28.168 --> 00:34:29.369
<i>Buenas noches.</i>

367
00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:57.865
<i>Ayuda!</i>

368
00:35:00.935 --> 00:35:03.103
<i>Ayuda!</i>

369
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:09.711
Kramer?

370
00:35:10.778 --> 00:35:11.879
Hey, man.

371
00:35:12.981 --> 00:35:14.515
I've told you
what you wanted to know!

372
00:35:14.549 --> 00:35:16.918
I fucking told you
who you're looking for!

373
00:35:43.811 --> 00:35:45.880
Kramer. Kramer!

374
00:35:58.092 --> 00:36:01.428
<i>Hello, Diego.</i>
<i>Or, should I call you...</i>

375
00:36:02.597 --> 00:36:04.331
<i>Dr. Cortez?</i>

376
00:36:04.364 --> 00:36:06.934
<i>I'd like to play a game.</i>

377
00:36:06.968 --> 00:36:10.470
<i>Attached to your arms</i>
<i>are two explosive devices.</i>

378
00:36:11.304 --> 00:36:13.173
<i>Pipe bombs.</i>

379
00:36:13.206 --> 00:36:17.411
<i>Think of the explosives</i>
<i>as a sort of cancer.</i>

380
00:36:17.444 --> 00:36:22.416
<i>A malignancy that must be</i>
<i>cut out for you to survive.</i>

381
00:36:22.449 --> 00:36:26.154
<i>The blades cannot cut through</i>
<i>the galvanized cable.</i>

382
00:36:26.186 --> 00:36:29.624
<i>But they can slice through</i>
<i>flesh and muscle,</i>

383
00:36:29.657 --> 00:36:32.593
<i>allowing you to cut</i>
<i>the cancer away.</i>

384
00:36:32.627 --> 00:36:35.295
<i>Live, or die.</i>
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

385
00:36:38.432 --> 00:36:40.802
No, no, no. No, no, no.

386
00:36:40.835 --> 00:36:42.335
Kramer.

387
00:36:42.737 --> 00:36:43.771
Kramer!

388
00:36:43.805 --> 00:36:45.773
Kramer!

389
00:36:45.807 --> 00:36:47.709
Kramer!

390
00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:37.678
You're gonna be okay.

391
00:39:40.413 --> 00:39:41.549
<i>Detective...</i>

392
00:39:41.582 --> 00:39:44.085
I could use your assistance...

393
00:39:45.586 --> 00:39:50.858
in locating some people that are
in need of our services.

394
00:40:16.284 --> 00:40:18.085
Okay. <i>Vamonos.</i>

395
00:42:08.129 --> 00:42:09.130
Mateo?

396
00:42:14.435 --> 00:42:15.636
Hey.

397
00:42:22.343 --> 00:42:23.744
Mm.

398
00:42:33.954 --> 00:42:34.955
<i>Gracias.</i>

399
00:44:51.759 --> 00:44:55.664
I'm arranging
a small team in Bolivia
next week, Margaret.

400
00:44:55.696 --> 00:44:58.933
Yeah, we have three cases
scheduled already.

401
00:44:58.966 --> 00:45:02.102
But I think that we might
have room for one more spot.

402
00:45:02.136 --> 00:45:04.104
Yeah. We're working
off the grid, of course,

403
00:45:04.138 --> 00:45:07.308
but if you think
you can get there, Margaret.

404
00:45:09.678 --> 00:45:13.280
No... Please,
no need to cry, Margaret.

405
00:45:14.649 --> 00:45:17.619
No...
I'm not an angel.

406
00:45:17.652 --> 00:45:19.186
It's pure science.

407
00:45:20.254 --> 00:45:22.389
All right.

408
00:45:22.423 --> 00:45:25.960
You send those medical records
in and we'll have a look,
all right?

409
00:45:26.628 --> 00:45:27.828
Perfect.

410
00:45:28.762 --> 00:45:30.064
See you soon, Margaret.

411
00:45:30.632 --> 00:45:31.832
See you soon.

412
00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:51.111
I've got a gun!

413
00:47:50.471 --> 00:47:51.972
What the fuck...

414
00:48:11.158 --> 00:48:12.159
Hi.

415
00:48:14.228 --> 00:48:15.396
Who are you?

416
00:48:16.531 --> 00:48:18.700
This is my associate, Amanda.

417
00:48:36.417 --> 00:48:38.520
Get some rest, Cecilia.

418
00:48:39.754 --> 00:48:42.122
You're going to
fucking need it.

419
00:48:52.667 --> 00:48:53.868
Mateo.

420
00:48:53.902 --> 00:48:56.003
What the fuck
is going on?

421
00:48:56.036 --> 00:48:57.705
Why are we back here?

422
00:48:58.873 --> 00:49:01.275
Oh, my God. What the...

423
00:49:07.549 --> 00:49:10.951
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Help. Who are you?

424
00:49:10.984 --> 00:49:14.087
-Do you know why we're here?
-Hey! Hey.

425
00:49:14.121 --> 00:49:16.390
Lady, do you know...

426
00:49:16.423 --> 00:49:17.692
Do you know who
brought us here?

427
00:49:19.059 --> 00:49:21.395
Hey! Can you help us?

428
00:49:27.301 --> 00:49:30.538
Who are you?
Please. Please, please.

429
00:49:30.572 --> 00:49:32.473
Hey, hey...

430
00:49:39.881 --> 00:49:41.448
What... What are you doing?

431
00:49:47.087 --> 00:49:48.322
Hey.

432
00:49:53.227 --> 00:49:54.228
John?

433
00:49:55.395 --> 00:49:56.598
It was you?

434
00:49:57.464 --> 00:49:58.700
Why?

435
00:49:59.834 --> 00:50:01.268
Why are we here?

436
00:50:02.637 --> 00:50:03.638
John!

437
00:50:04.506 --> 00:50:06.206
What is this?

438
00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:08.475
We were only trying
to help you.

439
00:50:09.744 --> 00:50:11.345
That game is over.

440
00:50:11.378 --> 00:50:13.480
And a new game is
about to begin.

441
00:50:16.851 --> 00:50:18.352
Valentina...

442
00:50:18.385 --> 00:50:20.522
...did my blood ever
make it to the lab?

443
00:50:21.288 --> 00:50:22.657
<i>Or...</i>

444
00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:25.760
did you just suck it out
and flush it down
the drain somewhere?

445
00:50:27.729 --> 00:50:29.396
Mr. Kramer. Mr. Kramer.

446
00:50:29.429 --> 00:50:31.331
Please, listen to me.
I beg you.

447
00:50:31.365 --> 00:50:33.500
I beg you, please. Please.

448
00:50:34.769 --> 00:50:36.270
We have nothing
to do with this.

449
00:50:36.303 --> 00:50:38.305
We didn't know what was
going on. It was all her.

450
00:50:38.338 --> 00:50:40.274
She planned the whole thing.

451
00:50:40.307 --> 00:50:44.478
Mateo, I don't even know
if that's your real name.

452
00:50:44.512 --> 00:50:47.381
-It is my real name.
-It is, oh.

453
00:50:48.716 --> 00:50:52.252
'Cause they have never heard
of you at the hospital.

454
00:50:52.286 --> 00:50:53.888
She told me to say that
I worked there.

455
00:50:53.922 --> 00:50:56.624
- But I don't. I'm sorry.
- Mm, mm.

456
00:50:56.658 --> 00:50:59.527
Please wait.
Let me explain.
- Mr. Kramer...

457
00:51:02.195 --> 00:51:04.498
I meant no harm.

458
00:51:04.532 --> 00:51:08.803
I would really like
to believe you, Gabriela.

459
00:51:11.171 --> 00:51:13.273
You'll have a chance
to prove yourself.

460
00:51:14.676 --> 00:51:17.545
<i>Por favor. Por favor.</i>

461
00:51:29.256 --> 00:51:32.092
The key to your freedom
is inside that box.

462
00:51:36.096 --> 00:51:37.599
What the hell is that?

463
00:51:37.632 --> 00:51:39.567
It's a Gigli saw.

464
00:51:40.969 --> 00:51:42.737
I thought you said
there was a key?

465
00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:44.806
He was speaking metaphorically.

466
00:51:44.839 --> 00:51:46.674
He does that a lot.

467
00:51:48.042 --> 00:51:50.110
When I get out of here,

468
00:51:50.143 --> 00:51:53.380
I'm gonna kill both of you
motherfuckers!

469
00:51:55.984 --> 00:51:57.552
That's a good plan.

470
00:51:57.585 --> 00:51:59.954
You're gonna wanna
really listen carefully

471
00:51:59.988 --> 00:52:02.322
to the rules
in order to pull that off.

472
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:05.292
Fuck you!

473
00:52:13.701 --> 00:52:14.736
Go ahead.

474
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:17.772
No. No.

475
00:52:17.805 --> 00:52:18.806
What...

476
00:52:22.476 --> 00:52:24.679
No. No. What?

477
00:52:28.482 --> 00:52:30.985
The wire saw inside of that box

478
00:52:31.019 --> 00:52:33.487
was invented
by an Italian physician.

479
00:52:33.521 --> 00:52:36.223
Leonardo Gigli.

480
00:52:36.256 --> 00:52:39.527
It creates an extraordinarily
clean-cut to the bone.

481
00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:40.862
No.

482
00:52:46.166 --> 00:52:48.102
No. No, no, no, no, no!

483
00:52:48.136 --> 00:52:49.737
No, no, no, no!

484
00:52:59.747 --> 00:53:02.550
The dotted line on your leg
marks the spot.

485
00:53:03.818 --> 00:53:06.219
Are you fucking crazy?

486
00:53:06.253 --> 00:53:08.956
What makes you think
I'd fucking cut off my own leg?

487
00:53:10.424 --> 00:53:12.325
Because if you don't,

488
00:53:12.359 --> 00:53:15.362
the wire saw that's wrapped
around your neck

489
00:53:16.164 --> 00:53:17.899
will first cut into your skin,

490
00:53:17.932 --> 00:53:20.034
then your vertebral ligaments,

491
00:53:20.068 --> 00:53:22.436
and finally, it'll sever
your spinal cord.

492
00:53:22.469 --> 00:53:24.204
No.

493
00:53:24.237 --> 00:53:26.473
The CliffsNotes version?

494
00:53:27.474 --> 00:53:29.309
It's gonna
cut your head off.

495
00:53:31.411 --> 00:53:32.412
No!

496
00:53:33.815 --> 00:53:34.849
You won't.

497
00:53:34.882 --> 00:53:36.751
You wouldn't.

498
00:53:36.784 --> 00:53:37.985
Uh, it's true.

499
00:53:38.686 --> 00:53:39.687
We won't.

500
00:53:42.289 --> 00:53:43.658
But Valentina might.

501
00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:47.360
All of you...

502
00:53:51.032 --> 00:53:52.332
All of you...

503
00:53:53.901 --> 00:53:54.969
All of you...

504
00:53:58.539 --> 00:54:01.008
You promised dying people.

505
00:54:02.110 --> 00:54:03.845
Dying people!

506
00:54:07.347 --> 00:54:08.816
That you could save their lives.

507
00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:13.921
And in doing so, you took
advantage of the only thing...

508
00:54:16.591 --> 00:54:18.325
that they still possessed.

509
00:54:21.863 --> 00:54:23.497
Hope.

510
00:54:23.531 --> 00:54:26.734
No, John. We've worked
to heal people.

511
00:54:28.202 --> 00:54:31.906
Your case was... different.

512
00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:35.910
And still you lie.

513
00:54:35.943 --> 00:54:39.647
My associate, Amanda here,
has had a look
at your bank records.

514
00:54:41.348 --> 00:54:42.650
Take a look.

515
00:54:46.087 --> 00:54:48.288
Who are those 34 people to you?

516
00:54:48.321 --> 00:54:50.423
John's case
was different?

517
00:54:50.457 --> 00:54:53.628
Did you heal
any of those 34 people?

518
00:54:53.661 --> 00:54:56.329
Did they have children
that are now orphaned?

519
00:54:56.363 --> 00:54:58.900
You've been doing this
larcenist dance now

520
00:54:58.933 --> 00:55:00.635
for more than eight years.

521
00:55:00.668 --> 00:55:02.469
Eight years.

522
00:55:02.502 --> 00:55:04.605
That's more than $8 million.

523
00:55:06.107 --> 00:55:07.474
That's a lot of pain...

524
00:55:07.508 --> 00:55:09.710
to inflict on others

525
00:55:10.978 --> 00:55:12.814
for your own enrichment.

526
00:55:12.847 --> 00:55:16.083
There was no healing
going on there, bitch.

527
00:55:16.117 --> 00:55:18.786
They're all underground.
I checked.

528
00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:20.888
We know everything.

529
00:55:20.922 --> 00:55:22.723
We have everything.

530
00:55:22.757 --> 00:55:25.793
Including the cash
from your house.

531
00:55:25.827 --> 00:55:27.695
We have it upstairs.

532
00:55:30.298 --> 00:55:32.567
Please. Please,
don't do this. Please.

533
00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:34.268
Please, help me.

534
00:55:34.302 --> 00:55:35.636
Please.

535
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:38.039
That's exactly
what we are doing, Valentina.

536
00:55:38.873 --> 00:55:40.373
This is not retribution,

537
00:55:42.109 --> 00:55:43.744
it's a reawakening.

538
00:55:47.815 --> 00:55:51.586
Valentina, follow
my instructions
if you want to live.

539
00:55:51.619 --> 00:55:54.989
There are more than five pounds
of marrow in the human body.

540
00:55:55.022 --> 00:55:56.423
All you need is three ounces.

541
00:55:56.456 --> 00:55:59.293
- There's more than
enough in your femur.

542
00:55:59.327 --> 00:56:00.595
Just suction it out,

543
00:56:00.628 --> 00:56:03.831
it'll be transferred
to that device right there

544
00:56:03.865 --> 00:56:07.101
and it will deactivate the saw
around your neck.

545
00:56:07.134 --> 00:56:08.501
Don't hesitate.

546
00:56:08.536 --> 00:56:10.638
Because your time is
prescribed.

547
00:56:13.507 --> 00:56:16.277
No. No.

548
00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:18.246
Now,
refusing to play the game

549
00:56:18.279 --> 00:56:20.147
is not an option.

550
00:56:20.181 --> 00:56:21.481
If you refuse...

551
00:56:21.515 --> 00:56:23.284
you will remain in this room...

552
00:56:25.219 --> 00:56:26.419
Forever.

553
00:56:28.322 --> 00:56:30.157
You'll make it.

554
00:56:30.191 --> 00:56:31.792
So long as you keep your head.

555
00:56:33.094 --> 00:56:35.229
We were not involved
in the whole thing.

556
00:56:36.496 --> 00:56:38.699
- Please.
- John! Please.

557
00:56:41.369 --> 00:56:43.137
This is not right.

558
00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:44.505
Not right?

559
00:56:46.707 --> 00:56:48.876
A lecture in moral decency?

560
00:56:50.011 --> 00:56:51.045
From you?

561
00:56:54.282 --> 00:56:55.917
No, no, John. John!

562
00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:58.418
Please, wait, John!

563
00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:00.121
John!

564
00:57:00.888 --> 00:57:02.056
John!

565
00:57:02.089 --> 00:57:04.025
Please, please, please, help me.

566
00:57:08.495 --> 00:57:09.730
John, please wait!

567
00:57:09.764 --> 00:57:11.132
Please wait! Please wait!

568
00:57:21.075 --> 00:57:22.710
<i>What do we do?</i>

569
00:57:34.989 --> 00:57:36.424
John!

570
00:57:36.456 --> 00:57:40.861
John, please wait!
You don't have to do this!
John! John!

571
00:57:41.862 --> 00:57:43.230
No, no.

572
00:57:43.264 --> 00:57:44.765
Valentina, look at me.

573
00:57:44.799 --> 00:57:45.800
Look at me!

574
00:57:46.334 --> 00:57:47.500
You can do this.

575
00:57:47.535 --> 00:57:49.370
No, no, no, I can't! No.

576
00:57:49.403 --> 00:57:50.905
You have to do this!

577
00:57:50.938 --> 00:57:52.106
No!

578
00:57:53.307 --> 00:57:55.843
Valentina,
come on! Do it!

579
00:57:56.744 --> 00:57:57.812
Okay.

580
00:58:04.986 --> 00:58:06.253
You can do it.

581
00:58:10.524 --> 00:58:12.093
Oh, my God! No!

582
00:58:15.463 --> 00:58:17.631
No, no, no, no, no! No, no, no!

583
00:58:18.532 --> 00:58:19.867
Oh, my God.

584
00:58:20.901 --> 00:58:22.636
- The tourniquet.
- No, no!

585
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:23.704
Put it on.

586
00:58:23.738 --> 00:58:25.139
Goddamn it! Valentina.

587
00:58:25.172 --> 00:58:26.774
The tourniquet, put it on!

588
00:58:27.775 --> 00:58:29.276
Faster!

589
00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:34.482
You can do this.

590
00:58:34.515 --> 00:58:36.784
You can do this!

591
00:58:37.618 --> 00:58:38.886
Now, the wire saw.

592
00:58:40.221 --> 00:58:41.522
Wrap it under your leg.

593
00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:45.760
If Diego could do this,
you can do this.

594
00:58:46.761 --> 00:58:47.762
Okay.

595
00:58:48.863 --> 00:58:51.298
Come on.

596
00:58:51.332 --> 00:58:54.168
You have to. Save yourself!

597
00:58:57.972 --> 00:58:59.607
Oh, my God!

598
00:59:08.649 --> 00:59:10.985
I can't! I can't!

599
00:59:11.018 --> 00:59:13.087
Don't stop, don't think!
Just do it!

600
00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.588
No!

601
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:24.533
Come on!

602
00:59:24.565 --> 00:59:26.634
Faster.

603
00:59:29.003 --> 00:59:32.873
Do it, don't think. Keep going.
You're gonna die. Come on!

604
00:59:35.376 --> 00:59:37.344
You're running
out of time!

605
00:59:37.378 --> 00:59:38.646
Come on.

606
00:59:39.246 --> 00:59:40.347
Fuck. Come on!

607
00:59:41.449 --> 00:59:42.950
Faster.

608
00:59:42.983 --> 00:59:46.120
Come on. Faster!
Keep going until it's off!

609
00:59:46.153 --> 00:59:47.988
No!

610
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:58.899
For God's sake, Valentina,
save yourself!

611
01:00:18.285 --> 01:00:19.320
Go on.

612
01:00:24.492 --> 01:00:26.927
Okay, okay, okay.

613
01:00:26.961 --> 01:00:29.763
You're running
out of time!

614
01:00:30.798 --> 01:00:32.633
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

615
01:00:32.666 --> 01:00:33.834
You're doing great.

616
01:00:33.868 --> 01:00:35.769
You're doing great.

617
01:00:55.956 --> 01:00:57.124
Please.

618
01:01:09.136 --> 01:01:11.138
I'm not gonna make it.

619
01:01:11.172 --> 01:01:12.806
No, no, no! I'm no
going to make it!

620
01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:15.442
Oh, my God. No. No. No.

621
01:01:15.476 --> 01:01:17.878
No, no, no, no!

622
01:01:18.712 --> 01:01:20.047
No, no, no, no!

623
01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.118
No. No, no, no!

624
01:01:24.151 --> 01:01:25.587
No!

625
01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:28.088
No!

626
01:01:43.538 --> 01:01:45.172
Oh, fuck.

627
01:02:00.754 --> 01:02:02.823
Help!

628
01:02:02.856 --> 01:02:04.091
<i>Help!</i>

629
01:02:04.124 --> 01:02:05.594
<i>This is all</i>
<i>your fault.</i>

630
01:02:05.627 --> 01:02:07.995
<i>You brought me into this.</i>
<i>You brought me into this!</i>

631
01:02:08.028 --> 01:02:09.897
<i>Get it together, Gabby!</i>

632
01:02:10.364 --> 01:02:11.999
<i>Oh, no...</i>

633
01:02:12.032 --> 01:02:14.368
<i>I'm not the one addicted</i>
<i>to Oxy, am I?</i>

634
01:02:20.207 --> 01:02:21.408
Gabriela's next.

635
01:02:26.113 --> 01:02:27.915
What?

636
01:02:27.948 --> 01:02:30.951
Sometimes we get
sucked into things that

637
01:02:32.721 --> 01:02:34.088
are against our nature.

638
01:02:34.121 --> 01:02:38.759
Drugs are as vicious
as they are powerful.

639
01:02:39.493 --> 01:02:41.262
We all have free will.

640
01:02:41.962 --> 01:02:44.765
Gabriela had her own free will.

641
01:02:44.798 --> 01:02:48.769
And if you can't handle this,
how will you handle
the rest of our work?

642
01:03:11.392 --> 01:03:13.961
They're not looking.
Why don't we use the...

643
01:03:13.994 --> 01:03:16.163
- Our clothes to tie them
and take it...
Yes, yes.

644
01:03:16.196 --> 01:03:18.533
- Yes, yes, yes, we can do that.
- We need a rope.

645
01:03:22.202 --> 01:03:24.138
Do you want to keep going?

646
01:03:25.139 --> 01:03:26.140
Yes.

647
01:03:26.608 --> 01:03:27.808
The pain...

648
01:03:28.809 --> 01:03:30.311
just comes in waves.

649
01:03:30.344 --> 01:03:33.247
Listen, I'm not ready
to do this without you.

650
01:03:34.181 --> 01:03:35.282
You are ready.

651
01:03:36.417 --> 01:03:38.319
You are ready and you can.

652
01:04:04.411 --> 01:04:07.515
Cecilia. Cecilia,
what are you doing?

653
01:04:12.554 --> 01:04:14.121
Cecilia,
don't touch her!

654
01:04:14.154 --> 01:04:16.957
- Shh.
Cecilia,
don't touch her.

655
01:04:17.792 --> 01:04:19.159
Stop.

656
01:04:21.830 --> 01:04:23.364
No, no.

657
01:04:26.233 --> 01:04:28.869
Right now, Amanda, these people
deserve to be tested.

658
01:04:28.902 --> 01:04:31.606
That lady doctor

659
01:04:31.639 --> 01:04:33.073
deserves nothing.

660
01:04:33.107 --> 01:04:35.008
Everyone deserves a chance.

661
01:04:35.042 --> 01:04:37.512
An opportunity
to redeem themselves.

662
01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:40.914
You should know that
more than anyone.

663
01:04:45.319 --> 01:04:46.320
Hmm.

664
01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:54.763
Cecilia.

665
01:04:54.796 --> 01:04:56.564
Cecilia, what the fuck is that?

666
01:04:56.598 --> 01:04:58.065
Cecilia, what are you doing?

667
01:05:06.006 --> 01:05:08.510
No... No. No. Wait!

668
01:05:09.376 --> 01:05:11.679
-No! No!
-Shh.

669
01:05:18.252 --> 01:05:19.420
Ugh.

670
01:05:33.967 --> 01:05:35.135
We have a rope.

671
01:05:35.169 --> 01:05:37.539
- No!
- Mateo!

672
01:05:38.907 --> 01:05:40.307
Fine, fine.

673
01:05:53.387 --> 01:05:56.990
Okay. Yes, you can loop it
around the table and...

674
01:05:57.826 --> 01:05:58.927
And pull it in.

675
01:06:08.135 --> 01:06:10.672
Yes, yes.

676
01:06:24.619 --> 01:06:26.821
-Pick up, pick up.
-Yeah.

677
01:06:31.759 --> 01:06:32.927
No!

678
01:06:35.730 --> 01:06:38.332
No! No, no!

679
01:07:10.264 --> 01:07:12.767
Listen. Just listen.

680
01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:14.067
You're right.

681
01:07:15.068 --> 01:07:16.370
I'm a total fraud.

682
01:07:19.106 --> 01:07:20.775
But my father, John,

683
01:07:20.808 --> 01:07:22.476
he's the real deal.

684
01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:24.244
And you know that.

685
01:07:25.513 --> 01:07:26.981
He can save you.

686
01:07:27.015 --> 01:07:28.448
Is that your concern?

687
01:07:30.685 --> 01:07:31.753
Saving me?

688
01:07:31.786 --> 01:07:33.287
But he can heal you.

689
01:07:34.421 --> 01:07:36.024
I swear to God.

690
01:07:36.056 --> 01:07:38.091
That's who I was
trying to call.

691
01:07:38.125 --> 01:07:39.561
Let me talk to him.

692
01:07:39.594 --> 01:07:42.296
Let me tell him where we are
and he will come.

693
01:07:42.329 --> 01:07:44.666
He will come help you.

694
01:07:44.699 --> 01:07:46.133
To save my life.

695
01:07:47.635 --> 01:07:50.638
Begging won't help. Trust me,
you're not the first to try.

696
01:08:01.583 --> 01:08:02.617
Please.

697
01:08:02.650 --> 01:08:04.418
Please.

698
01:08:04.451 --> 01:08:07.021
Please, please.
Please help. Please.

699
01:08:07.055 --> 01:08:08.823
Please, please.

700
01:08:31.946 --> 01:08:34.549
John, we have a visitor.

701
01:08:42.523 --> 01:08:44.759
<i>Open this fucking door!</i>

702
01:08:44.792 --> 01:08:46.493
<i>It's Parker Sears!</i>

703
01:08:46.527 --> 01:08:48.696
<i>I've come to get my money</i>
<i>back and I'm not going</i>
<i>until I get it!</i>

704
01:08:48.730 --> 01:08:51.398
- Help! Hey!
<i>- Pederson, you thief!</i>

705
01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:37.645
Oh, fuck.

706
01:09:54.562 --> 01:09:55.663
Hey.

707
01:09:57.999 --> 01:10:00.568
Hey! What is this?

708
01:10:04.605 --> 01:10:07.809
Walk in with a gun,
get treated like a criminal.

709
01:10:09.711 --> 01:10:10.712
Who are you?

710
01:10:12.513 --> 01:10:14.949
I was gonna ask you
the same question.

711
01:10:18.853 --> 01:10:21.288
I know you. Kramer.

712
01:10:21.321 --> 01:10:22.657
Brain cancer, right?

713
01:10:28.361 --> 01:10:30.031
What are you
doing here, Parker?

714
01:10:30.064 --> 01:10:31.833
I came to get my money back.

715
01:10:33.634 --> 01:10:35.703
These people are just crooks.

716
01:10:35.737 --> 01:10:37.004
Look at this.

717
01:10:38.539 --> 01:10:39.640
Ah.

718
01:10:40.474 --> 01:10:41.576
Hmm...

719
01:10:42.242 --> 01:10:43.443
Yeah.

720
01:10:57.225 --> 01:10:58.559
Is that Pederson?

721
01:10:59.359 --> 01:11:00.528
And Mateo.

722
01:11:01.896 --> 01:11:06.033
Gabriela, Valentina,
and Diego was in on it too.

723
01:11:06.901 --> 01:11:08.435
They're all con artists.

724
01:11:09.369 --> 01:11:12.305
And we, we were the suckers.

725
01:11:12.339 --> 01:11:14.307
That bitch.

726
01:11:14.341 --> 01:11:17.444
I gave her everything.
All the money I had.

727
01:11:17.477 --> 01:11:19.614
That was for my family,
that money.

728
01:11:20.748 --> 01:11:23.718
To make good with my kids
when I was gone.

729
01:11:23.751 --> 01:11:27.487
But instead,
you traded it for magic beans.

730
01:11:27.522 --> 01:11:31.726
More time, a shot at life.

731
01:11:31.759 --> 01:11:33.761
What's your life
really mean to you, Parker?

732
01:11:33.795 --> 01:11:35.563
Have you ever thought
about that?

733
01:11:35.596 --> 01:11:38.065
Because if you find
the meaning of your life,

734
01:11:39.567 --> 01:11:41.501
what you've found is your soul.

735
01:11:43.004 --> 01:11:45.706
We have your money.
You can be assured of that.

736
01:11:46.607 --> 01:11:49.143
But before I let you
confront Cecilia,

737
01:11:49.177 --> 01:11:52.780
there's a game that she has to
play out to its conclusion.

738
01:11:54.215 --> 01:11:55.616
What do you mean a game?

739
01:11:59.053 --> 01:12:00.087
Oh, God...

740
01:12:00.121 --> 01:12:02.190
You killed Valentina.

741
01:12:02.223 --> 01:12:04.659
We don't kill.

742
01:12:04.692 --> 01:12:06.828
You chopped her
fucking head off!

743
01:12:06.861 --> 01:12:10.231
Valentina died
because she didn't have
the will to live.

744
01:12:10.264 --> 01:12:11.666
She failed her test.

745
01:12:11.699 --> 01:12:15.837
John, if he found us here,
others might too, and soon.

746
01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:18.172
We're wasting time.

747
01:12:18.206 --> 01:12:20.641
I'm just trying
to give Mr. Sears

748
01:12:20.675 --> 01:12:22.844
a chance to make his choice.

749
01:12:22.877 --> 01:12:24.779
What choice?

750
01:12:24.812 --> 01:12:27.480
I don't have a choice. What are
you two fucking talking about?

751
01:12:27.515 --> 01:12:29.349
I'm going to give you
an opportunity

752
01:12:29.382 --> 01:12:33.054
to do something significant
with your life.

753
01:12:34.822 --> 01:12:35.990
Right now.

754
01:12:36.958 --> 01:12:37.925
I'm listening.

755
01:12:37.959 --> 01:12:40.628
But first, I'm going to
have to insist...

756
01:12:41.929 --> 01:12:43.030
no guns.

757
01:12:50.938 --> 01:12:52.974
Rules are rules.

758
01:12:53.007 --> 01:12:55.843
Consequences for
breaking them will be dire.

759
01:12:55.877 --> 01:12:57.111
Understood?

760
01:12:59.814 --> 01:13:01.448
Undo me now?

761
01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:06.821
John.

762
01:13:13.527 --> 01:13:15.096
I promise you, Amanda.

763
01:13:15.129 --> 01:13:19.399
One way or another,
it's all gonna work out
according to plan.

764
01:13:20.935 --> 01:13:24.639
Why don't you go and prepare
Gabriela for the next game?

765
01:13:28.175 --> 01:13:30.811
-You want me to do it?
-No.

766
01:13:41.088 --> 01:13:43.423
But the anesthesiologist
is next.

767
01:13:47.962 --> 01:13:49.931
Lady, can you
talk to me, please?

768
01:13:49.964 --> 01:13:51.966
Can you... Can you
please talk to me?

769
01:13:51.999 --> 01:13:53.433
Please talk to me.

770
01:13:53.466 --> 01:13:54.769
You fucking bitch!

771
01:13:54.802 --> 01:13:56.938
You fucking cunt!

772
01:14:07.648 --> 01:14:09.283
Help me, help me.

773
01:14:09.317 --> 01:14:10.518
Help me, help me.
Help me. Please.

774
01:14:10.551 --> 01:14:12.186
Believe it or not, I just did.

775
01:14:12.219 --> 01:14:13.921
-You were next.
-He's a monster.

776
01:14:13.955 --> 01:14:15.589
He's gonna kill you
the same way he's gonna
kill all of us. Please...

777
01:14:15.623 --> 01:14:17.124
You don't know John.

778
01:14:17.158 --> 01:14:20.628
If you want any more of my help,
keep your mouth shut about that.

779
01:14:36.711 --> 01:14:39.113
Is that so I don't shoot that
thief in the face?

780
01:14:42.717 --> 01:14:44.719
Trust me, Mr. Sears.

781
01:14:44.752 --> 01:14:47.487
In short order,
she'll wish that you had.

782
01:15:07.041 --> 01:15:08.042
Mateo.

783
01:15:12.013 --> 01:15:13.014
Fuck.

784
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.235
What...

785
01:15:38.005 --> 01:15:40.007
Ah...

786
01:15:41.342 --> 01:15:42.910
What the fuck is that?

787
01:16:06.233 --> 01:16:08.002
What is it? What is it?

788
01:16:08.035 --> 01:16:10.604
I don't know what the fuck
all of these things are.

789
01:16:10.638 --> 01:16:12.306
Medical supplies, I think.

790
01:16:12.339 --> 01:16:14.675
And there's
a fucking bone cutter.

791
01:16:14.708 --> 01:16:16.143
A craniotome.

792
01:16:16.177 --> 01:16:19.146
I don't care what the fucking
thing is called, Cecilia!

793
01:16:20.114 --> 01:16:22.216
There's this thing
that says "Play me."

794
01:16:22.249 --> 01:16:23.584
I'm not gonna touch that thing.

795
01:16:27.221 --> 01:16:28.756
Fine. Fine.

796
01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:33.861
<i>Hello, Mateo.</i>

797
01:16:34.662 --> 01:16:36.664
<i>It's time to play a game.</i>

798
01:16:36.697 --> 01:16:38.866
<i>The rules are simple.</i>

799
01:16:38.899 --> 01:16:42.002
<i>Place a big enough piece</i>
<i>of your cerebral tissue</i>

800
01:16:42.036 --> 01:16:45.606
<i>into the glass enzyme tank</i>
<i>and you win.</i>

801
01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:47.542
A piece of what?

802
01:16:47.576 --> 01:16:50.044
-A piece of what?
-Gray matter.

803
01:16:50.678 --> 01:16:52.079
What does that mean?

804
01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:54.048
A piece of your brain.

805
01:16:54.081 --> 01:16:55.550
This is insane.

806
01:16:55.584 --> 01:16:58.385
- This is insane.
- Kramer!

807
01:16:58.419 --> 01:17:00.921
<i>John, please!</i>

808
01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:04.325
<i>Kramer!</i>

809
01:17:04.358 --> 01:17:05.626
Please!

810
01:17:08.597 --> 01:17:11.966
<i>If you complete</i>
<i>your task in less than</i>
<i>three minutes,</i>

811
01:17:11.999 --> 01:17:16.737
<i>the enzymes will dissolve</i>
<i>the tissue to close a circuit.</i>

812
01:17:16.770 --> 01:17:18.706
<i>This will save your life.</i>

813
01:17:18.739 --> 01:17:20.708
<i>But know this.</i>

814
01:17:20.741 --> 01:17:23.944
<i>The brain is a remarkably</i>
<i>resilient organ.</i>

815
01:17:23.978 --> 01:17:26.113
<i>There have been accounts</i>
<i>of people undergoing</i>

816
01:17:26.147 --> 01:17:29.817
<i>complete anatomical</i>
<i>hemispherectomies.</i>

817
01:17:29.850 --> 01:17:34.822
<i>Half their brain removed,</i>
<i>only to have it rewire itself,</i>

818
01:17:34.855 --> 01:17:38.959
<i>so that the patient</i>
<i>not only survives, but thrives.</i>

819
01:17:38.993 --> 01:17:40.361
Ah...

820
01:17:40.394 --> 01:17:41.829
I don't know how to do this.

821
01:17:41.862 --> 01:17:43.731
I don't know how to do that.

822
01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:49.069
Okay...

823
01:17:49.103 --> 01:17:53.374
<i>The only thing</i>
<i>I have not provided</i>
<i>is your anesthetic.</i>

824
01:17:53.407 --> 01:17:58.012
<i>But trust me,</i>
<i>you will want to remain alert.</i>

825
01:17:58.679 --> 01:18:00.314
<i>And if you fail to act,</i>

826
01:18:00.347 --> 01:18:04.251
<i>the consequences</i>
<i>will not go well for you.</i>

827
01:18:04.285 --> 01:18:07.087
<i>Do not waste time.</i>

828
01:18:07.121 --> 01:18:10.559
<i>Live or die,</i>
<i>the choice is yours.</i>

829
01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:17.031
No, no, no.

830
01:18:17.998 --> 01:18:20.134
I need to take this thing off.

831
01:18:23.605 --> 01:18:25.072
-Somebody help me.
-Mateo.

832
01:18:25.105 --> 01:18:27.474
What do I do? What do I do?
What do I do?

833
01:18:27.509 --> 01:18:28.909
You have to use the craniotome.

834
01:18:30.811 --> 01:18:32.647
Yes, Mateo, you have to.

835
01:18:32.681 --> 01:18:34.882
That is not going to
fucking happen.

836
01:18:34.915 --> 01:18:36.518
You have to cut into your scalp.

837
01:18:36.551 --> 01:18:38.319
-No. No.
-Yes!

838
01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:40.788
I can't do it.
I can't...

839
01:18:40.821 --> 01:18:43.324
Do you want to live?
Or wind up like her?

840
01:18:46.193 --> 01:18:47.895
-Mateo!
-Okay.

841
01:18:52.399 --> 01:18:53.434
Is there a cable?

842
01:18:54.703 --> 01:18:56.470
Is this it?

843
01:18:56.503 --> 01:18:57.771
This is it.

844
01:18:57.805 --> 01:18:59.206
Yes.

845
01:19:07.649 --> 01:19:10.784
Just do it.

846
01:20:17.619 --> 01:20:18.753
Faster!

847
01:20:37.871 --> 01:20:40.274
Oh, my God. Oh... Oh, my God.

848
01:20:48.182 --> 01:20:49.584
Pull it out!

849
01:20:52.687 --> 01:20:54.689
Ah!

850
01:20:54.723 --> 01:20:56.624
Dig it out! Do it!

851
01:21:15.309 --> 01:21:16.310
Oh...

852
01:21:24.084 --> 01:21:26.654
No!

853
01:21:36.798 --> 01:21:38.432
No!

854
01:21:46.641 --> 01:21:49.009
No! Mateo!

855
01:22:01.922 --> 01:22:03.658
You guys are fucking sick.

856
01:22:04.526 --> 01:22:06.193
We're sick?

857
01:22:06.226 --> 01:22:09.163
These people kill
with false hope.

858
01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:29.049
What if there is
something her father
can do to help you?

859
01:22:29.717 --> 01:22:31.686
Amanda, you know

860
01:22:31.719 --> 01:22:33.086
as well as I do...

861
01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:36.691
people will say almost anything
to save their own life.

862
01:22:36.724 --> 01:22:38.626
Yeah, but her father's real.

863
01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:39.928
We both know that.

864
01:22:39.993 --> 01:22:42.129
Amanda, the reality is...

865
01:22:43.665 --> 01:22:44.666
I'm dying.

866
01:22:46.634 --> 01:22:47.968
I am dying.

867
01:22:49.503 --> 01:22:50.772
You have to face that.

868
01:22:50.805 --> 01:22:52.473
But our work's not gonna end.

869
01:22:53.775 --> 01:22:57.712
And I'm trust... trusting you...

870
01:23:01.315 --> 01:23:02.349
to carry on.

871
01:23:33.848 --> 01:23:35.550
It's almost morning.

872
01:23:35.583 --> 01:23:37.552
We have a job to do.

873
01:23:37.585 --> 01:23:39.353
We're running out of time.

874
01:23:39.386 --> 01:23:43.423
I want you to go
and free Mr. Sears.

875
01:23:45.092 --> 01:23:47.060
And see if he'll play
by the rules.

876
01:23:59.674 --> 01:24:00.708
No.

877
01:24:00.742 --> 01:24:01.976
No.

878
01:24:02.010 --> 01:24:04.812
Gabriela, you have to take it.

879
01:24:05.914 --> 01:24:07.015
No.

880
01:24:07.047 --> 01:24:09.751
We'll never get
out of here otherwise.

881
01:24:25.934 --> 01:24:28.201
<i>What was that?</i>

882
01:24:30.137 --> 01:24:31.338
<i>What's that?</i>

883
01:24:38.245 --> 01:24:39.714
<i>Hello, Gabriela.</i>

884
01:24:40.815 --> 01:24:42.050
<i>I want to play a game...</i>

885
01:24:42.082 --> 01:24:43.585
No, no, stop it!

886
01:24:43.618 --> 01:24:45.452
Stop it. Stop it...

887
01:24:47.555 --> 01:24:49.624
I'm afraid that's not
going to work.

888
01:24:51.191 --> 01:24:53.661
<i>You are going to</i>
<i>have to play the game.</i>

889
01:25:22.255 --> 01:25:25.693
No! No, no, no, no, no!

890
01:25:25.727 --> 01:25:26.894
What the fuck?

891
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:57.257
<i>Although</i>
<i>you all pretended</i>

892
01:25:57.290 --> 01:25:59.794
to cure my cancer,

893
01:25:59.827 --> 01:26:02.530
I have spent years in treatment.

894
01:26:02.563 --> 01:26:05.867
<i>Chemotherapy,</i>
<i>immunotherapy, radiation.</i>

895
01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:10.470
<i>Radiation machines</i>
<i>are not to be trifled with.</i>

896
01:26:10.504 --> 01:26:13.206
So, follow my instructions
carefully, Gabriela.

897
01:26:20.148 --> 01:26:21.381
Fuck.

898
01:26:25.053 --> 01:26:30.357
<i>The only way out is</i>
<i>to free your hand and ankle</i>
<i>from the shackles.</i>

899
01:26:30.992 --> 01:26:33.260
<i>Use the tool above you.</i>

900
01:26:33.293 --> 01:26:34.929
No! No, you can't!

901
01:26:34.962 --> 01:26:36.664
You can't! Let me out!

902
01:26:36.698 --> 01:26:38.032
Let me out!

903
01:26:38.066 --> 01:26:42.402
Broken bones heal.
Flesh can be grafted.

904
01:26:42.436 --> 01:26:46.074
<i>This will not be easy,</i>
<i>but then,</i>

905
01:26:46.107 --> 01:26:50.044
nothing worth having,
like life, ever is.

906
01:27:00.121 --> 01:27:01.823
You have to take it, Gabby.

907
01:27:06.293 --> 01:27:07.360
Do it.

908
01:27:07.394 --> 01:27:08.830
You have to do it, Gabby.

909
01:27:27.949 --> 01:27:29.249
No, no, no, no, no!

910
01:27:29.282 --> 01:27:30.484
Start with your foot.

911
01:27:30.518 --> 01:27:32.285
You'll swing out of the way.

912
01:27:35.857 --> 01:27:36.858
Okay, Gabby.

913
01:28:17.297 --> 01:28:19.033
You did it, Gabby.

914
01:28:29.610 --> 01:28:30.611
No.

915
01:28:32.914 --> 01:28:34.447
No. No.

916
01:28:37.718 --> 01:28:41.589
No. No, no. No.

917
01:28:41.622 --> 01:28:44.158
Stop it. Please.

918
01:28:44.192 --> 01:28:46.894
Don't stop. Gabby!

919
01:29:28.135 --> 01:29:29.270
Drop her at a hospital.

920
01:29:29.303 --> 01:29:30.972
Okay, play time's over.

921
01:29:33.406 --> 01:29:35.408
Give me the keys.

922
01:29:35.442 --> 01:29:37.778
I stated to you very clearly,

923
01:29:37.812 --> 01:29:40.882
that guns were
against the rules.

924
01:29:40.915 --> 01:29:42.550
Fuck your rules, John.

925
01:29:42.583 --> 01:29:44.752
The keys to Cecilia's chains.

926
01:29:44.785 --> 01:29:48.022
You don't need the keys.
She's not going anywhere.

927
01:29:58.966 --> 01:29:59.967
Now, move.

928
01:30:21.421 --> 01:30:23.557
Come on. Move.

929
01:30:29.630 --> 01:30:31.198
I thought
you forgot about me.

930
01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:33.466
Not a chance.

931
01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:35.202
You know I'd die for you, baby.

932
01:30:41.409 --> 01:30:42.743
Unlock her.

933
01:30:43.978 --> 01:30:44.979
Now!

934
01:31:03.631 --> 01:31:07.168
I've been wanting to do that
since the moment I met you.

935
01:31:12.807 --> 01:31:15.242
Come on, old man.
Lock yourself in.

936
01:31:25.519 --> 01:31:26.821
Come on, move!

937
01:32:03.824 --> 01:32:04.992
New game.

938
01:32:05.026 --> 01:32:08.929
It's called we live,
you die, fuck you.

939
01:32:08.963 --> 01:32:10.131
Simple enough?

940
01:32:10.164 --> 01:32:12.500
I told you
Parker would break the rules.

941
01:32:12.533 --> 01:32:14.301
You failed your test, asshole.

942
01:32:15.403 --> 01:32:17.405
We need to get her
to a hospital.

943
01:32:17.438 --> 01:32:19.373
She won her game

944
01:32:19.407 --> 01:32:21.208
and she deserves to live.

945
01:32:21.242 --> 01:32:22.877
Oh, does she now?

946
01:32:23.811 --> 01:32:26.247
Her injuries need
medical treatment.

947
01:32:27.314 --> 01:32:28.649
Do they?

948
01:32:34.722 --> 01:32:36.557
Don't even think about it!

949
01:32:38.092 --> 01:32:39.493
No, no, no, no.

950
01:32:39.528 --> 01:32:42.396
No, no, no, no, no!

951
01:32:45.366 --> 01:32:47.768
You sick bitch!

952
01:32:51.305 --> 01:32:55.709
Unfortunately, I don't think
she's gonna make it.

953
01:32:58.479 --> 01:32:59.680
Parker.

954
01:33:02.283 --> 01:33:03.284
Give me the keys.

955
01:33:14.395 --> 01:33:15.663
Lock yourself in.

956
01:33:48.362 --> 01:33:49.797
So, tell me, John.

957
01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:53.200
You've been doing this for a
very long time, haven't you?

958
01:33:53.234 --> 01:33:54.368
How did I stop you?

959
01:33:55.503 --> 01:33:57.539
Am I just that good?

960
01:33:57.572 --> 01:34:00.007
Don't flatter yourself.

961
01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:02.276
I just had a lapse in judgement.

962
01:34:02.309 --> 01:34:04.178
-That's all.
-Yeah, I agree.

963
01:34:04.211 --> 01:34:06.515
For a guy as smart
as you are, John,

964
01:34:06.548 --> 01:34:09.884
you kind of overplayed
your hand here,
wouldn't you say?

965
01:34:09.917 --> 01:34:11.152
You don't give a shit

966
01:34:11.185 --> 01:34:13.287
that all your friends are dead
because of you?

967
01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:14.421
Friends?

968
01:34:16.223 --> 01:34:17.691
Not friends.

969
01:34:17.725 --> 01:34:19.860
They were loose ends,
sweetheart.

970
01:34:19.894 --> 01:34:22.062
Nothing but loose ends.

971
01:34:22.096 --> 01:34:25.833
Do you want to know
what I thought when
I watched them each die?

972
01:34:26.867 --> 01:34:29.638
One less person
to split the money with.

973
01:34:29.670 --> 01:34:31.540
So, thank you.

974
01:34:31.573 --> 01:34:32.940
You did me a favor.

975
01:34:32.973 --> 01:34:35.376
You're gonna have to get
the money back from me,

976
01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:38.513
before you two can split it.

977
01:34:38.547 --> 01:34:40.347
I think
we'll get the money back.

978
01:34:40.381 --> 01:34:41.782
It's upstairs.

979
01:34:41.815 --> 01:34:44.351
You know she's eventually
gonna kill you, too, right?

980
01:34:44.385 --> 01:34:45.686
Fuck off, Amanda.

981
01:34:45.719 --> 01:34:47.321
Amanda's right.

982
01:34:47.354 --> 01:34:48.989
She's gonna burn you.

983
01:34:49.023 --> 01:34:50.791
You just can't see it yet.

984
01:34:50.824 --> 01:34:52.259
God...

985
01:34:52.293 --> 01:34:54.929
Is that really
all you've got left, John?

986
01:34:54.962 --> 01:34:57.765
When I realized
who you really were...

987
01:34:57.798 --> 01:34:59.400
Jig-fucking-saw...

988
01:35:01.335 --> 01:35:02.770
I got a bit worried.

989
01:35:03.771 --> 01:35:05.439
God's honest.

990
01:35:05.472 --> 01:35:07.942
And now, the great John Kramer

991
01:35:07.975 --> 01:35:10.411
is gonna die
in one of his own traps.

992
01:35:10.444 --> 01:35:13.080
There's some wicked irony.

993
01:35:13.113 --> 01:35:16.450
And the crazy thing is,
that you could have
just walked away.

994
01:35:17.885 --> 01:35:21.355
Acknowledged that you
got beat, got conned.

995
01:35:22.624 --> 01:35:23.824
But, no...

996
01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:28.095
You just had to come back,
didn't you?

997
01:35:30.431 --> 01:35:33.334
Why don't we put this bitch
on the other side of that thing

998
01:35:33.367 --> 01:35:34.969
and press play?

999
01:35:55.889 --> 01:35:59.728
You know, this fucking asshole
is dead in two months,

1000
01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:03.397
but I want him to suffer
like he made me suffer.

1001
01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:07.501
I want his last memory to be
watching someone innocent die.

1002
01:36:07.535 --> 01:36:09.571
If you think I'm innocent...

1003
01:36:09.604 --> 01:36:10.904
You?

1004
01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:12.741
Not for a second.

1005
01:36:16.810 --> 01:36:18.445
But I think I hear an answer.

1006
01:36:26.621 --> 01:36:28.088
<i>- Hey, Carlos.</i>
<i>- Hi.</i>

1007
01:36:28.122 --> 01:36:30.257
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1008
01:36:30.291 --> 01:36:33.093
<i>I've got some friends</i>
<i>I want you to meet.</i>

1009
01:36:33.127 --> 01:36:35.597
<i>-Wanna come inside?</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

1010
01:36:35.630 --> 01:36:36.864
<i>Come on.</i>

1011
01:36:40.769 --> 01:36:42.136
Here we are.

1012
01:36:46.307 --> 01:36:47.975
Look who I found.

1013
01:36:57.284 --> 01:36:58.419
John...

1014
01:36:58.452 --> 01:36:59.688
Who is that?

1015
01:36:59.721 --> 01:37:01.589
A friend.

1016
01:37:04.391 --> 01:37:08.095
And a terrible,
unforeseen consequence.

1017
01:37:17.004 --> 01:37:18.573
Please, don't do this.

1018
01:37:20.274 --> 01:37:23.444
- The boy is innocent.
- Exactly.

1019
01:37:24.378 --> 01:37:27.848
So, if you let him die,
it's all on you.

1020
01:37:32.152 --> 01:37:34.556
How do we get
this thing started?

1021
01:37:34.589 --> 01:37:36.857
It's activated by the subject.

1022
01:37:38.593 --> 01:37:40.894
Of course.

1023
01:37:40.928 --> 01:37:44.131
Because you wouldn't be
responsible for killing anyone,
would you?

1024
01:37:44.833 --> 01:37:46.701
Fucking hypocrite.

1025
01:37:46.735 --> 01:37:49.937
Well, you might want
to tell the kid the rules
before we start.

1026
01:37:49.970 --> 01:37:51.372
He's not a player.

1027
01:37:53.541 --> 01:37:54.975
In any of this.

1028
01:37:55.008 --> 01:37:56.276
Oh, come on, John.

1029
01:37:57.378 --> 01:37:59.413
Do the scary voice.

1030
01:37:59.446 --> 01:38:02.383
"I'd like to play a game."

1031
01:38:02.916 --> 01:38:04.118
No?

1032
01:38:06.019 --> 01:38:08.857
You really want the boy to play
without hearing the rules?

1033
01:38:08.889 --> 01:38:11.291
I don't think
he's gonna fare well.

1034
01:38:16.930 --> 01:38:19.500
John, I will cut his throat!

1035
01:38:45.392 --> 01:38:47.227
This is not right.

1036
01:38:47.261 --> 01:38:49.963
- It's not right.
- Oh, really?

1037
01:38:49.997 --> 01:38:53.367
A lecture on moral decency
from you?

1038
01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:56.638
You've got ten seconds,
or I hit the lever myself.

1039
01:38:56.671 --> 01:39:00.040
And I don't have a silly
moral code like you, trust me.

1040
01:39:03.812 --> 01:39:05.145
Carlos...

1041
01:39:11.553 --> 01:39:12.554
<i>Comprende?</i>

1042
01:39:18.292 --> 01:39:20.662
Turn it on,
Parker, and let's go.

1043
01:39:30.304 --> 01:39:31.338
No <i>jalar.</i>

1044
01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:34.702
No, no!

1045
01:40:38.405 --> 01:40:39.439
No.

1046
01:41:06.801 --> 01:41:08.402
Not waterboarding, huh?

1047
01:41:09.436 --> 01:41:10.638
Blood-boarding.

1048
01:42:10.031 --> 01:42:13.133
No <i>jalar,</i> Carlos! No <i>jalar!</i>

1049
01:42:26.714 --> 01:42:28.650
Stop! Stop!

1050
01:42:32.020 --> 01:42:33.420
Stop!

1051
01:42:35.422 --> 01:42:37.224
Stop!

1052
01:42:41.294 --> 01:42:44.098
Stop it, you're killing him!

1053
01:42:44.132 --> 01:42:46.801
All he has to do is
push the lever,

1054
01:42:46.834 --> 01:42:47.902
sacrifice the kid.

1055
01:42:55.543 --> 01:42:57.177
Let's go and get the money.

1056
01:43:13.226 --> 01:43:17.230
Once I heard your voice
over that speaker,
I knew I'd be fine.

1057
01:43:17.264 --> 01:43:20.568
I can't believe they fell
for the whole damn thing,
hook, line, and sinker.

1058
01:43:20.601 --> 01:43:23.638
- I know.
- Fucking idiots.

1059
01:43:31.913 --> 01:43:34.549
But if you were the last player,

1060
01:43:34.582 --> 01:43:37.785
who was supposed to be
on the other side
of that plank with you?

1061
01:43:40.420 --> 01:43:41.622
There's the money.

1062
01:44:07.215 --> 01:44:08.950
Where's the fucking money?

1063
01:44:11.318 --> 01:44:12.920
Where's the money?

1064
01:44:42.850 --> 01:44:43.918
Fuck!

1065
01:44:48.689 --> 01:44:49.724
Fuck.

1066
01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:42.510
You are a warrior, my boy.

1067
01:45:43.144 --> 01:45:44.545
A warrior.

1068
01:45:45.478 --> 01:45:46.747
Are you okay?

1069
01:45:48.415 --> 01:45:50.852
Not exactly
as we planned it, but...

1070
01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:54.021
How did they know?

1071
01:45:57.058 --> 01:45:58.526
How did they know about you?

1072
01:45:59.961 --> 01:46:02.362
Parker Sears!

1073
01:46:02.395 --> 01:46:04.298
Okay? He was in on it!

1074
01:46:04.332 --> 01:46:06.901
He's a handler
and he's fucking Cecilia, too!

1075
01:46:10.538 --> 01:46:13.841
<i>I was able</i>
<i>to find the man you asked for.</i>

1076
01:46:13.875 --> 01:46:15.676
Uh-huh. Good.

1077
01:46:15.710 --> 01:46:17.778
<i>But Parker Sears?</i>

1078
01:46:17.812 --> 01:46:19.680
<i>You'll have to find</i>
<i>another way.</i>

1079
01:46:26.287 --> 01:46:27.487
Gotcha.

1080
01:46:28.256 --> 01:46:29.323
<i>We have a visitor.</i>

1081
01:46:45.339 --> 01:46:47.975
<i>Cecilia Pederson,</i>

1082
01:46:48.009 --> 01:46:50.278
<i>Parker Sears,</i>

1083
01:46:50.311 --> 01:46:53.214
<i>you've each been</i>
<i>working a grift.</i>

1084
01:46:53.247 --> 01:46:55.082
<i>Playing a role,</i>

1085
01:46:55.116 --> 01:46:56.951
<i>working together</i>

1086
01:46:56.984 --> 01:47:00.321
<i>continuing to play out</i>
<i>your scam.</i>

1087
01:47:00.354 --> 01:47:05.793
<i>Never realizing that</i>
<i>you have been the marks</i>
<i>all night long.</i>

1088
01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:15.369
<i>You were given a chance</i>
<i>for redemption,</i>

1089
01:47:15.403 --> 01:47:20.007
<i>but at every turn,</i>
<i>you chose death,</i>

1090
01:47:20.041 --> 01:47:21.976
<i>instead of life.</i>

1091
01:47:23.878 --> 01:47:26.781
I promise you,
one way or another,

1092
01:47:26.814 --> 01:47:29.116
it's all gonna work out
according to plan.

1093
01:47:29.150 --> 01:47:31.919
<i>You have played</i>
<i>your last con game...</i>

1094
01:47:31.953 --> 01:47:34.322
- No!
<i>- ...but not your last game.</i>

1095
01:47:34.355 --> 01:47:39.459
<i>The two of you</i>
<i>have worked together</i>
<i>to destroy others.</i>

1096
01:47:43.965 --> 01:47:47.768
<i>Now, you will work</i>
<i>against each other.</i>

1097
01:47:50.304 --> 01:47:53.140
<i>Only one can survive.</i>

1098
01:47:57.378 --> 01:47:59.780
<i>And the choice is yours.</i>

1099
01:48:13.694 --> 01:48:15.296
I thought you forgot about me.

1100
01:48:18.332 --> 01:48:19.967
You know I'd die for you, baby.

1101
01:48:38.953 --> 01:48:39.954
Ah!

1102
01:48:57.671 --> 01:48:59.807
You know she's eventually
gonna kill you, too, right?

1103
01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:02.443
- Fuck off, Amanda.
- She's gonna burn you.

1104
01:49:02.476 --> 01:49:04.211
You just can't see it yet.

1105
01:49:31.572 --> 01:49:32.907
John!

1106
01:49:37.278 --> 01:49:38.312
John!

1107
01:50:04.972 --> 01:50:06.173
<i>Gracias.</i>

1108
01:50:07.341 --> 01:50:08.809
Let's get you home, Carlos.

1109
01:52:36.725 --> 01:52:38.392
It's my war wound.

1110
01:52:40.394 --> 01:52:42.162
Where is your scar...

1111
01:52:43.264 --> 01:52:44.398
Henry?

1112
01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:47.067
Thank you, Detective,

1113
01:52:48.102 --> 01:52:50.838
for locating
my fellow cancer patient.

1114
01:52:59.813 --> 01:53:01.782
Out of all the men to cheat,

1115
01:53:03.284 --> 01:53:05.252
you picked John Kramer?

1116
01:53:06.220 --> 01:53:07.454
I mean...

1117
01:53:09.089 --> 01:53:12.727
I call that epic bad luck.

1118
01:53:12.761 --> 01:53:14.061
Please...

1119
01:53:14.795 --> 01:53:16.263
John, please.

1120
01:53:17.632 --> 01:53:19.033
Please, don't kill me.

1121
01:53:19.066 --> 01:53:22.036
That's the last thing that
you should be worried about.

1122
01:53:23.470 --> 01:53:24.838
Now...

1123
01:53:25.973 --> 01:53:28.208
I want to play a game.

1124
01:53:31.513 --> 01:53:33.447
No! No!

1125
01:53:36.183 --> 01:53:37.851
No! No!
