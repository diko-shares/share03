1
00:01:31.786 --> 00:01:33.286
That was a long one.

2
00:01:37.688 --> 00:01:42.292
I don't suppose you can tell me
how it looks, can you?

3
00:01:42.293 --> 00:01:45.394
Unfortunately,
I'm just the technician.

4
00:01:45.395 --> 00:01:47.861
Your doctor will have
your results tomorrow.

5
00:01:49.502 --> 00:01:51.667
- Would you like some help to...
- Thank you very much.

6
00:01:52.608 --> 00:01:53.702
You're very kind.

7
00:02:02.883 --> 00:02:04.676
I mean, yeah,

8
00:02:04.677 --> 00:02:08.000
the cancer has brought
grief and pain

9
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:11.324
and fear into my every
waking moment.

10
00:02:12.292 --> 00:02:16.623
Okay, Chris.
Today is a gift.

11
00:02:16.624 --> 00:02:19.897
That's why they call it
the present.

12
00:02:22.032 --> 00:02:23.449
Anyone else?

13
00:02:25.028 --> 00:02:26.605
Henry Kessler.

14
00:02:26.606 --> 00:02:28.070
Please.

15
00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:30.739
Stage four pancreatic.

16
00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.444
Terminal.

17
00:02:33.313 --> 00:02:36.613
That's what they tell me,
anyway, but...

18
00:02:39.582 --> 00:02:41.651
I'm gonna fight this
'til the end.

19
00:02:45.992 --> 00:02:47.723
How much time do I have?

20
00:02:51.225 --> 00:02:52.497
A year?

21
00:02:53.295 --> 00:02:56.235
Months at best.

22
00:02:56.236 --> 00:02:59.506
I still have a lot of work
that needs to be done.

23
00:02:59.507 --> 00:03:00.571
My advice?

24
00:03:02.071 --> 00:03:03.104
Retire.

25
00:03:05.242 --> 00:03:07.310
You know, at this stage,

26
00:03:07.311 --> 00:03:10.630
everyone always searches
for a way out.

27
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:13.951
But sometimes,
those who accept their fate,

28
00:03:13.952 --> 00:03:15.351
have an easier time.

29
00:03:15.352 --> 00:03:16.752
Easier time? What?

30
00:03:18.153 --> 00:03:19.458
Dying?

31
00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:26.696
So, your advice to me
is to die easy?

32
00:04:41.337 --> 00:04:44.774
Help! Hey! Help! Help, please!

33
00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.281
<i>I'd like to play a game.</i>

34
00:04:57.282 --> 00:05:01.626
<i>Perhaps one that addresses
those sticky fingers of yours.</i>

35
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.830
<i>I've had my eyes on you
and I do not like what I see.</i>

36
00:05:09.238 --> 00:05:12.469
<i>Your job as a custodian
is a noble one.</i>

37
00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.270
<i>Sanitizing and sterilizing
the hospital...</i>

38
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.540
<i>...helping patients
avoid sickness.</i>

39
00:05:18.541 --> 00:05:20.325
<i>But there is
a sickness inside you</i>

40
00:05:20.326 --> 00:05:22.110
<i>that needs to be excised.</i>

41
00:05:23.381 --> 00:05:25.814
<i>You have the ability
to not only save</i>

42
00:05:25.815 --> 00:05:28.248
<i>your soul today,
but your sight.</i>

43
00:05:29.718 --> 00:05:32.157
<i>All you have to do is
click the dial</i>

44
00:05:32.158 --> 00:05:34.226
<i>across the five positions</i>

45
00:05:34.227 --> 00:05:37.227
<i>and you will live to see
another day.</i>

46
00:05:37.228 --> 00:05:39.392
<i>You have 60 seconds.</i>

47
00:05:39.393 --> 00:05:40.632
Help, please!

48
00:05:46.605 --> 00:05:49.509
Help me! Please, please,
please. Help. Help!

49
00:06:09.196 --> 00:06:11.557
I can't! I can't, I can't!

50
00:06:11.558 --> 00:06:13.830
Please, no!

51
00:06:24.846 --> 00:06:26.447
Fuck you!

52
00:07:09.088 --> 00:07:10.491
Good choice.

53
00:07:31.146 --> 00:07:32.911
Here you go, sir.

54
00:07:32.912 --> 00:07:33.976
Thank you.

55
00:07:47.792 --> 00:07:50.630
Can I get
a blueberry scone, please?

56
00:07:52.694 --> 00:07:54.227
Oh, they look good.

57
00:07:56.036 --> 00:07:57.036
Thank you.

58
00:08:01.337 --> 00:08:02.543
Henry.

59
00:08:05.412 --> 00:08:08.112
We were in the same
cancer support group.

60
00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:09.928
John Kramer.

61
00:08:09.929 --> 00:08:11.744
I remember you.

62
00:08:11.745 --> 00:08:13.884
Hey, good to see you.

63
00:08:15.221 --> 00:08:16.249
And you as well.

64
00:08:19.094 --> 00:08:20.326
You look marvelous.

65
00:08:20.327 --> 00:08:23.022
Thank you. I... I...
I feel great.

66
00:08:23.023 --> 00:08:25.759
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but you were, uh...

67
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.096
Yeah, stage four pancreatic.

68
00:08:28.097 --> 00:08:30.967
But now, four months later,

69
00:08:30.968 --> 00:08:33.838
I'm in complete remission.

70
00:08:37.373 --> 00:08:38.579
How?

71
00:08:39.775 --> 00:08:43.415
It's a... it's a long story.

72
00:08:43.416 --> 00:08:46.615
I'd love to hear it.

73
00:08:46.616 --> 00:08:48.149
You got a minute to tell me?

74
00:08:49.089 --> 00:08:50.855
Sure. Sure.

75
00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:57.826
So, um,

76
00:08:57.827 --> 00:09:01.628
I read about a doctor,
a specialist of sorts.

77
00:09:01.629 --> 00:09:04.164
A Dr. Finn Pederson.

78
00:09:04.165 --> 00:09:07.853
He offered a treatment

79
00:09:07.854 --> 00:09:11.542
and it is a groundbreaking

80
00:09:11.543 --> 00:09:14.714
drug cocktail
combined with surgery.

81
00:09:20.352 --> 00:09:21.853
It's my war wound.

82
00:09:24.489 --> 00:09:26.819
I know it looks bad,

83
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.039
but it was totally worth it.

84
00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.260
Yeah.

85
00:09:34.731 --> 00:09:37.934
- Is it available here?
- No.

86
00:09:37.935 --> 00:09:40.888
No, no, the treatment's not
available in the States.

87
00:09:40.889 --> 00:09:43.842
The, uh, the medication
isn't approved by the FDA.

88
00:09:44.842 --> 00:09:47.208
Hell, it isn't approved
by anybody.

89
00:09:48.516 --> 00:09:51.179
I, um... I haven't
seen them since...

90
00:09:51.946 --> 00:09:54.017
since my treatment in Norway.

91
00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:55.890
But...

92
00:10:01.161 --> 00:10:03.323
this link...

93
00:10:06.035 --> 00:10:07.035
is still good.

94
00:10:12.634 --> 00:10:13.839
Hey, John,

95
00:10:15.837 --> 00:10:18.343
good luck, man. Okay?

96
00:10:18.344 --> 00:10:20.912
I'm... I'm rooting for you.

97
00:10:22.149 --> 00:10:23.416
Thank you.

98
00:10:23.417 --> 00:10:24.685
Take care.

99
00:10:42.537 --> 00:10:44.366
Doctor, what exactly is
the procedure?

100
00:10:44.367 --> 00:10:48.105
Well, under the right circumstances
and with the proper stimuli,

101
00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:50.675
genes can be turned on and
turned off like a light switch.

102
00:10:50.676 --> 00:10:53.246
<i>And you're targeting
the cancer cells?</i>

103
00:10:53.247 --> 00:10:54.839
<i>Exactly.</i>

104
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.448
What we've managed to do is to create
a new cutting-edge drug cocktail,

105
00:10:58.449 --> 00:10:59.783
along with surgery,

106
00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:02.420
to teach the malignant cells
to switch off.

107
00:11:02.421 --> 00:11:03.922
<i>Fascinating.</i>

108
00:11:04.422 --> 00:11:05.422
Hmm.

109
00:11:17.136 --> 00:11:21.370
<i>My father, Dr. Finn Pederson,
was forced into hiding</i>

110
00:11:21.371 --> 00:11:26.209
<i>by corrupt governments
and their relationship to big pharma.</i>

111
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:28.113
Why?

112
00:11:28.114 --> 00:11:32.279
Because my father was on the cusp
of curing dozens of diseases.

113
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.654
<i>Which means no more need
for lifelong medication.</i>

114
00:11:36.655 --> 00:11:39.353
Can you imagine
what that implies?

115
00:11:41.289 --> 00:11:44.060
Well, the big drug companies
certainly can.

116
00:11:44.061 --> 00:11:48.400
<i>And I'm here to say
that this just cannot stand.</i>

117
00:11:48.401 --> 00:11:52.902
<i>So, while my father continues to make
further improvements to his formula,</i>

118
00:11:52.903 --> 00:11:55.835
<i>I'm taking his treatment
on the road</i>

119
00:11:55.836 --> 00:11:57.137
<i>for more trials,</i>

120
00:11:57.138 --> 00:12:00.913
to save as many lives
as humanly possible.

121
00:12:33.445 --> 00:12:34.815
Who is this?

122
00:12:35.747 --> 00:12:37.712
This is Cecilia Pederson.

123
00:12:37.713 --> 00:12:39.215
Is this John Kramer?

124
00:12:40.155 --> 00:12:41.418
Yes, it is.

125
00:12:41.419 --> 00:12:43.055
<i>Good.</i>

126
00:12:43.056 --> 00:12:46.085
We received the email
with your medical records, Mr. Kramer.

127
00:12:46.086 --> 00:12:47.686
Thank you for reaching out.

128
00:12:47.687 --> 00:12:51.298
<i>I'm sifting through potential candidates
for our program.</i>

129
00:12:51.299 --> 00:12:52.791
So, I'm calling you now,

130
00:12:52.792 --> 00:12:55.495
because we have spots opening
for treatment in about three months.

131
00:13:00.835 --> 00:13:02.271
Mr. Kramer?

132
00:13:02.805 --> 00:13:04.207
Uh, yes, I'm here.

133
00:13:05.614 --> 00:13:07.606
You don't have three months,
do you?

134
00:13:09.746 --> 00:13:11.615
<i>Okay, listen...</i>

135
00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:13.685
I'm currently working in Mexico.

136
00:13:13.686 --> 00:13:16.084
Oslo has become
too difficult for us.

137
00:13:16.085 --> 00:13:18.482
But we have a team
of specialists here

138
00:13:18.483 --> 00:13:21.253
who share our belief
in the Pederson method

139
00:13:21.254 --> 00:13:24.025
and I've gathered
a group of eligible patients

140
00:13:24.026 --> 00:13:26.324
to start treatment
a week from now.

141
00:13:26.325 --> 00:13:28.429
<i>I think I could add
one more spot.</i>

142
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.871
<i>If you're interested.</i>

143
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.038
Yes, I'm interested.

144
00:13:33.836 --> 00:13:34.934
Henry Kessler...

145
00:13:34.935 --> 00:13:36.169
<i>referred me to you.</i>

146
00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:40.474
Henry. He's doing well.
I'm so pleased.

147
00:13:41.383 --> 00:13:42.508
I wonder if you could...

148
00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:44.944
could you tell me a little more
about the treatment?

149
00:13:44.945 --> 00:13:46.747
<i>Of course.</i>

150
00:13:46.748 --> 00:13:50.621
It's a two-prong treatment that uses
my father's Xaxiophenol cocktail.

151
00:13:50.622 --> 00:13:56.425
And in your case, it would be combined
with a cranial surgery to clear the tumor.

152
00:13:56.426 --> 00:13:59.564
When both are used together,
the results have been stunning.

153
00:13:59.565 --> 00:14:01.829
<i>Over 90% success rate.</i>

154
00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:03.065
<i>I know it's a long trip,</i>

155
00:14:03.066 --> 00:14:06.501
Mr. Kramer,
especially in your condition,

156
00:14:06.502 --> 00:14:09.940
but I want you to know that we found
a very beautiful location

157
00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:12.109
for our clinic
outside Mexico City.

158
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.277
It's in a
well-off-the-grid area,

159
00:14:14.278 --> 00:14:18.075
in the countryside where you can
have safety and privacy.

160
00:14:18.076 --> 00:14:22.555
<i>We'll also, of course, arrange for
a trusted driver at your arrival.</i>

161
00:14:22.556 --> 00:14:24.820
What date did you have in mind?

162
00:14:24.821 --> 00:14:26.973
The 5th, Friday after next.

163
00:14:26.974 --> 00:14:29.127
I think I could make that.

164
00:14:46.109 --> 00:14:48.543
- J. Kramer? Yeah?
<i>- Si.</i> Yes.

165
00:14:48.544 --> 00:14:51.064
I'm Diego. Welcome to Mexico.

166
00:14:51.065 --> 00:14:53.708
Allow me, sir. Please. This way.

167
00:14:53.709 --> 00:14:56.352
There you go.

168
00:15:00.221 --> 00:15:01.726
Take a look at that.

169
00:15:01.727 --> 00:15:04.344
That's the Metropolitan Cathedral.

170
00:15:04.345 --> 00:15:06.853
That's the revolutionary memorial.

171
00:15:06.854 --> 00:15:09.362
That's the Angel
of Independence.

172
00:15:09.363 --> 00:15:12.500
Take a look at that.
Isn't it beautiful?

173
00:15:14.473 --> 00:15:15.634
Hey, J.

174
00:15:15.635 --> 00:15:20.139
That, my friend, that's the old
Aztec statue of Tlaloc.

175
00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.373
That's where the priests

176
00:15:21.374 --> 00:15:23.275
chop the hearts
out of their subjects

177
00:15:23.276 --> 00:15:24.944
and roll them down the stairs.

178
00:15:26.579 --> 00:15:29.586
Every day, a tourist wants me
to take them here.

179
00:15:29.587 --> 00:15:31.156
Very strange.

180
00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:51.540
Hey, J.

181
00:15:51.541 --> 00:15:52.672
You okay?

182
00:16:01.215 --> 00:16:02.579
Get out!

183
00:16:08.927 --> 00:16:10.228
What's your name?

184
00:16:10.794 --> 00:16:12.230
John Kramer.

185
00:16:12.231 --> 00:16:15.835
Lie to me again and I'll empty
this chamber in your eye.

186
00:16:15.836 --> 00:16:18.269
I'm not lying.
My name is John Kramer.

187
00:16:20.535 --> 00:16:23.623
Not to worry, <i>senor</i>
Kramer, you're fine.

188
00:16:23.624 --> 00:16:26.712
You're safe. Come with me.
Come, come.

189
00:16:26.713 --> 00:16:29.709
Here. Welcome. Watch your head.

190
00:16:55.676 --> 00:16:57.069
Your room.

191
00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.639
Here. Come.

192
00:17:01.794 --> 00:17:03.413
It's here. Good luck.

193
00:17:10.325 --> 00:17:11.325
<i>Si?</i>

194
00:17:13.288 --> 00:17:15.788
I am John Kramer.

195
00:17:16.892 --> 00:17:18.098
Come.

196
00:17:28.402 --> 00:17:30.308
I... Gabriela.

197
00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:42.353
<i>Mi familia.</i>

198
00:17:46.726 --> 00:17:47.726
Come.

199
00:17:56.034 --> 00:17:57.901
Sleep. Sleep here.

200
00:17:57.902 --> 00:18:00.140
Dr. Cecilia Pederson?

201
00:18:00.804 --> 00:18:01.834
Ah. <i>Si.</i>

202
00:18:03.274 --> 00:18:07.477
She saved life. My life.

203
00:18:10.277 --> 00:18:12.383
I get. I get now.

204
00:18:26.228 --> 00:18:28.861
Mr. Kramer, welcome.

205
00:18:34.505 --> 00:18:38.975
That was quite a reception
that I got on the way out here.

206
00:18:38.976 --> 00:18:40.642
Oh, our welcome wagon?

207
00:18:41.682 --> 00:18:43.347
I know, I'm sorry.

208
00:18:43.348 --> 00:18:46.598
But we've had to beef up
the security wherever we go.

209
00:18:46.599 --> 00:18:49.849
The big drug companies
are always one step behind

210
00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:54.227
and so we must keep our location
secret from everyone, even you.

211
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.795
Come.

212
00:18:56.796 --> 00:18:58.693
I want you to meet the team.

213
00:19:07.142 --> 00:19:09.242
Yeah?

214
00:19:10.209 --> 00:19:14.275
That's Carlos.
Our local football star.

215
00:19:14.276 --> 00:19:16.447
His father is the caretaker.

216
00:19:39.265 --> 00:19:42.740
This used to be
a chemical factory back in the day.

217
00:20:19.175 --> 00:20:20.610
Mateo.

218
00:20:21.177 --> 00:20:22.914
Hello, Doctor.

219
00:20:22.915 --> 00:20:24.483
This is John Kramer.

220
00:20:24.484 --> 00:20:26.711
Very nice to meet you, Mr. Kramer,
and welcome to our clinic.

221
00:20:26.712 --> 00:20:28.750
You're in very good hands
with us.

222
00:20:29.557 --> 00:20:30.685
Hmm.

223
00:20:30.686 --> 00:20:33.153
Mateo is an anesthesiologist
at Hospital Alto Prado.

224
00:20:33.154 --> 00:20:37.996
He did his residency at Johns Hopkins
and has worked a lot with my father.

225
00:20:37.997 --> 00:20:39.413
- Yes.
- He'll be helping out

226
00:20:39.414 --> 00:20:40.830
with your surgery tomorrow.

227
00:20:40.831 --> 00:20:42.126
Thank you.

228
00:20:42.127 --> 00:20:45.030
- I'll be right here if you need anything.
- Thank you.

229
00:20:50.441 --> 00:20:52.938
This is Valentina,
one of our nurses.

230
00:20:52.939 --> 00:20:55.942
She'll be taking some scans
and drawing some blood,

231
00:20:55.943 --> 00:20:59.215
all in preparation for the
injection therapy later today.

232
00:20:59.216 --> 00:21:01.517
Mr. Sears' vitals look good.

233
00:21:01.518 --> 00:21:03.820
He's cleared for release.

234
00:21:03.821 --> 00:21:04.885
Wonderful.

235
00:21:06.389 --> 00:21:08.790
Parker Sears, John Kramer.

236
00:21:11.394 --> 00:21:14.028
Thyroid cancer, advanced. You?

237
00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:15.764
Uh, brain.

238
00:21:16.398 --> 00:21:19.231
Ah. You win.

239
00:21:23.111 --> 00:21:26.038
Sorry, they cut me open yesterday.

240
00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.191
Took out a tumor
the size of my knob.

241
00:21:29.192 --> 00:21:31.544
I'm just about to start
the cocktail.

242
00:21:31.545 --> 00:21:33.581
Mutated natural killer cells.

243
00:21:33.582 --> 00:21:36.218
They're a type of
cytotoxic lymphocyte.

244
00:21:36.219 --> 00:21:38.017
Developed by my father.

245
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.558
Good luck, John.

246
00:21:42.092 --> 00:21:43.858
Thank you.

247
00:21:43.859 --> 00:21:46.831
So, we've arranged
for you to stay at a hotel.

248
00:21:46.832 --> 00:21:47.994
Shall we begin?

249
00:21:54.436 --> 00:21:55.936
Please, don't move.

250
00:22:08.449 --> 00:22:10.915
<i>So, Mr. Kramer...</i>

251
00:22:10.916 --> 00:22:13.954
- What do you do? Like, for a living?
- John.

252
00:22:14.555 --> 00:22:16.592
Please, call me John.

253
00:22:16.593 --> 00:22:18.629
And what do you do, John?

254
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:22.732
I've been a civil engineer and
an architect most of my life.

255
00:22:23.364 --> 00:22:24.569
Now, I...

256
00:22:26.468 --> 00:22:27.836
have a few hobbies.

257
00:22:28.841 --> 00:22:29.841
Hmm.

258
00:22:30.438 --> 00:22:31.642
Let me guess.

259
00:22:32.408 --> 00:22:34.407
Classic car renovation.

260
00:22:35.981 --> 00:22:38.211
- No?
- No.

261
00:22:38.212 --> 00:22:39.349
I, uh...

262
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:42.114
I help people overcome
inner obstacles.

263
00:22:43.589 --> 00:22:46.459
Help them make positive
changes in their lives.

264
00:22:47.027 --> 00:22:48.890
Like a life coach, yeah?

265
00:22:50.063 --> 00:22:51.156
Something like that.

266
00:22:51.966 --> 00:22:53.730
Sounds nice.

267
00:22:53.731 --> 00:22:56.865
I can't think of anything more
important than helping others.

268
00:22:58.035 --> 00:22:59.505
Yeah.

269
00:23:01.676 --> 00:23:03.104
Tequila.

270
00:23:03.105 --> 00:23:04.169
For good luck.

271
00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.173
Thank you, Gabriela.

272
00:23:09.013 --> 00:23:10.013
<i>De nada.</i>

273
00:23:11.151 --> 00:23:12.881
It's a local favorite.

274
00:23:12.882 --> 00:23:14.612
You can't drink it now, though.

275
00:23:14.613 --> 00:23:16.148
Not before surgery.

276
00:23:21.491 --> 00:23:24.563
"My sun sets to rise again."

277
00:23:26.628 --> 00:23:28.765
Your sun is rising again, John.

278
00:23:31.038 --> 00:23:32.230
We will make sure of it.

279
00:24:23.685 --> 00:24:25.525
You speak English, Carlos?

280
00:24:26.057 --> 00:24:27.888
<i>Que?</i>

281
00:24:27.889 --> 00:24:30.563
That's about
as good as my Spanish.

282
00:24:32.792 --> 00:24:34.600
How do you say "pull"?

283
00:24:37.169 --> 00:24:39.297
Pull, pull. Pull.

284
00:24:41.468 --> 00:24:42.674
<i>Jalar.</i>

285
00:24:43.569 --> 00:24:44.775
<i>Jalar.</i>

286
00:24:47.542 --> 00:24:49.392
Excellent. <i>Jalar.</i>

287
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:57.788
<i>Gracias.</i>

288
00:25:00.623 --> 00:25:03.061
And who performs the surgery?

289
00:25:03.062 --> 00:25:05.230
Dr. Ramone Cortez.

290
00:25:05.231 --> 00:25:07.399
Also at Alto Prado.

291
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.361
He's the best neurosurgeon
in 2,000 miles.

292
00:25:10.362 --> 00:25:13.901
He's the doctor I'd use
if my own family was on the table.

293
00:25:13.902 --> 00:25:17.172
Now, we'll be performing
an "awake craniotomy."

294
00:25:17.173 --> 00:25:21.042
This means that you'll be floating in
and out of consciousness...

295
00:25:21.043 --> 00:25:23.676
...so that we can do
function mapping...

296
00:25:23.677 --> 00:25:26.309
<i>This allows us to monitor
your abilities,</i>

297
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:28.680
<i>so that we don't touch
any part of your brain</i>

298
00:25:28.681 --> 00:25:31.052
<i>that might affect speech
or movement...</i>

299
00:26:07.261 --> 00:26:08.690
Mr. Kramer...

300
00:26:08.691 --> 00:26:10.729
Can you please wiggle
your fingers?

301
00:26:11.529 --> 00:26:14.297
Good. Motor function is clear.

302
00:26:14.298 --> 00:26:15.668
Suction vac, please.

303
00:26:45.191 --> 00:26:47.392
Valentina,
will you move...

304
00:26:49.501 --> 00:26:51.099
Right, right, right.

305
00:27:05.611 --> 00:27:08.848
Okay, great.
We're gonna put you back to sleep.

306
00:27:08.849 --> 00:27:11.253
I'm gonna count down from ten.

307
00:27:11.254 --> 00:27:12.285
Ten...

308
00:27:13.292 --> 00:27:15.794
nine, eight...

309
00:27:16.328 --> 00:27:18.929
<i>seven, six...</i>

310
00:27:26.634 --> 00:27:27.839
Hi, there.

311
00:27:29.539 --> 00:27:30.776
You did great.

312
00:27:31.805 --> 00:27:33.743
Where are we?

313
00:27:33.744 --> 00:27:36.447
We're two blocks away
from Mateo's hospital.

314
00:27:36.448 --> 00:27:38.245
In case you need a transfusion.

315
00:27:38.912 --> 00:27:40.247
I got your bloodwork.

316
00:27:45.193 --> 00:27:47.287
Hemoglobin's normal.

317
00:27:49.923 --> 00:27:51.423
It all looks good, John.

318
00:27:52.265 --> 00:27:53.458
It all looks good.

319
00:27:55.629 --> 00:27:56.835
Now...

320
00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.229
Drink two a day.

321
00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:01.303
One in the morning
and one at night.

322
00:28:01.304 --> 00:28:02.773
Okay.

323
00:28:02.774 --> 00:28:04.370
In addition
to my father's treatment,

324
00:28:04.371 --> 00:28:08.242
it contains a painkiller you'll need
for the next seven days.

325
00:28:09.143 --> 00:28:11.047
And after that,
what happens then?

326
00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:14.347
Your whole life happens then.

327
00:28:20.352 --> 00:28:23.059
I never got a chance
to say goodbye to Gabriela.

328
00:28:23.726 --> 00:28:25.143
Or, any of the others.

329
00:28:25.144 --> 00:28:26.854
I'll send them your best.

330
00:28:26.855 --> 00:28:28.564
Don't get your head wet.

331
00:28:28.565 --> 00:28:30.547
The bandage is anti-bacterial.

332
00:28:30.548 --> 00:28:32.529
It will stave off infection.

333
00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:36.242
Valentina will swing by
to keep an eye on it for you.

334
00:28:36.243 --> 00:28:37.570
Get some rest now, John.

335
00:28:37.571 --> 00:28:38.811
Okay.

336
00:28:40.746 --> 00:28:42.914
Dr. Pederson,
just so you know...

337
00:28:42.915 --> 00:28:45.477
I'll wire the second half
of the payment tomorrow morning.

338
00:28:46.385 --> 00:28:47.385
Thank you, John.

339
00:28:48.949 --> 00:28:50.889
Have a good life, John.

340
00:28:52.318 --> 00:28:55.091
A long, good life.

341
00:30:01.461 --> 00:30:03.219
Do you have a gift card?

342
00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:06.162
It's for a friend. Thank you.

343
00:30:46.704 --> 00:30:48.908
<i>Un momento, por favor.</i>

344
00:31:05.954 --> 00:31:07.157
Hello?

345
00:31:10.957 --> 00:31:12.261
Gabriela?

346
00:32:24.505 --> 00:32:25.884
<i>Hello, and welcome</i>

347
00:32:25.885 --> 00:32:27.264
<i>to section five</i>

348
00:32:27.265 --> 00:32:29.206
<i>in our neurosurgery series.</i>

349
00:32:29.207 --> 00:32:32.605
<i>The human brain is a mystery,
hundreds of millions...</i>

350
00:32:36.513 --> 00:32:39.582
<i>We'll be performing
an "awake craniotomy."</i>

351
00:32:39.583 --> 00:32:43.286
<i>This means that you'll be floating in

352
00:32:45.856 --> 00:32:47.086
Valentina...

353
00:32:47.087 --> 00:32:48.753
Right, right, right.

354
00:33:28.494 --> 00:33:30.161
<i>Have a good life, John.</i>

355
00:33:30.162 --> 00:33:32.562
<i>A long, good life.</i>

356
00:33:47.114 --> 00:33:48.982
Hey, guys.

357
00:33:48.983 --> 00:33:53.390
Did you know that when the Aztecs roll the heart
of their victim down the stairs

358
00:33:53.391 --> 00:33:57.093
people will take them home
and display them like ornaments?

359
00:33:57.094 --> 00:33:59.790
In their fucking houses.
Yeah.

360
00:33:59.791 --> 00:34:03.564
- Nice.
- Yes, sir, welcome to Mexico.

361
00:34:04.264 --> 00:34:07.832
Okay, so here we are.

362
00:34:09.041 --> 00:34:11.671
This is the Tlaloc statue.
Okay?

363
00:34:12.572 --> 00:34:14.509
Huh. Thank you, man.
Have a good one.

364
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:16.447
Of course, man. Thanks.

365
00:34:26.019 --> 00:34:27.225
Hello.

366
00:34:28.221 --> 00:34:29.425
<i>Buenas noches.</i>

367
00:34:55.888 --> 00:34:57.915
<i>Ayuda!</i>

368
00:35:00.988 --> 00:35:03.162
<i>Ayuda!</i>

369
00:35:08.765 --> 00:35:09.765
Kramer?

370
00:35:10.836 --> 00:35:11.929
Hey, man.

371
00:35:13.039 --> 00:35:15.004
I've told you
what you wanted to know!

372
00:35:15.005 --> 00:35:16.971
I fucking told you
who you're looking for!

373
00:35:43.868 --> 00:35:45.930
Kramer. Kramer!

374
00:35:58.144 --> 00:36:01.484
<i>Hello, Diego. Or, should I call you...</i>

375
00:36:02.656 --> 00:36:04.381
<i>Dr. Cortez?</i>

376
00:36:04.382 --> 00:36:06.983
<i>I'd like to play a game.</i>

377
00:36:06.984 --> 00:36:10.526
<i>Attached to your arms
are two explosive devices.</i>

378
00:36:11.357 --> 00:36:13.230
<i>Pipe bombs.</i>

379
00:36:13.231 --> 00:36:17.467
<i>Think of the explosives
as a sort of cancer.</i>

380
00:36:17.468 --> 00:36:22.472
<i>A malignancy that must be
cut out for you to survive.</i>

381
00:36:22.473 --> 00:36:26.073
<i>The blades cannot cut through
the galvanized cable.</i>

382
00:36:26.074 --> 00:36:29.358
<i>But they can slice through
flesh and muscle,</i>

383
00:36:29.359 --> 00:36:32.643
<i>allowing you to cut
the cancer away.</i>

384
00:36:32.644 --> 00:36:35.345
<i>Live, or die.
The choice is yours.</i>

385
00:36:38.484 --> 00:36:40.857
No, no, no. No, no, no.

386
00:36:40.858 --> 00:36:42.393
Kramer.

387
00:36:42.793 --> 00:36:47.764
Kramer!

388
00:39:36.068 --> 00:39:37.733
You're gonna be okay.

389
00:39:40.467 --> 00:39:41.599
<i>Detective...</i>

390
00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.135
I could use your assistance...

391
00:39:45.644 --> 00:39:50.916
in locating some people that are
in need of our services.

392
00:40:16.338 --> 00:40:18.136
Okay. <i>Vamonos.</i>

393
00:42:08.184 --> 00:42:09.184
Mateo?

394
00:42:14.489 --> 00:42:15.693
Hey.

395
00:42:22.398 --> 00:42:23.800
Mm.

396
00:42:34.012 --> 00:42:35.012
<i>Gracias.</i>

397
00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:55.719
I'm arranging a small team
in Bolivia next week, Margaret.

398
00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:58.987
Yeah, we have three cases
scheduled already.

399
00:44:58.988 --> 00:45:02.154
But I think that we might
have room for one more spot.

400
00:45:02.155 --> 00:45:04.756
Yeah. We're working
off the grid, of course,

401
00:45:04.757 --> 00:45:07.359
but if you think
you can get there, Margaret.

402
00:45:09.735 --> 00:45:13.332
No... Please,
no need to cry, Margaret.

403
00:45:14.706 --> 00:45:17.670
No...
I'm not an angel.

404
00:45:17.671 --> 00:45:19.239
It's pure science.

405
00:45:20.311 --> 00:45:22.442
All right.

406
00:45:22.443 --> 00:45:26.015
You send those medical records
in and we'll have a look, all right?

407
00:45:26.679 --> 00:45:27.885
Perfect.

408
00:45:28.816 --> 00:45:30.118
See you soon, Margaret.

409
00:45:30.685 --> 00:45:31.889
See you soon.

410
00:46:49.863 --> 00:46:51.166
I've got a gun!

411
00:47:50.528 --> 00:47:52.029
What the fuck...

412
00:48:11.217 --> 00:48:12.217
Hi.

413
00:48:14.287 --> 00:48:15.448
Who are you?

414
00:48:16.589 --> 00:48:18.753
This is my associate, Amanda.

415
00:48:36.476 --> 00:48:38.570
Get some rest, Cecilia.

416
00:48:39.811 --> 00:48:42.178
You're going to
fucking need it.

417
00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:53.922
Mateo.

418
00:48:53.923 --> 00:48:55.838
What the fuck
is going on?

419
00:48:55.839 --> 00:48:57.754
Why are we back here?

420
00:48:58.927 --> 00:49:01.327
Oh, my God. What the...

421
00:49:07.601 --> 00:49:11.006
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Help. Who are you?

422
00:49:11.007 --> 00:49:14.144
- Do you know why we're here?
- Hey! Hey.

423
00:49:14.145 --> 00:49:16.405
Lady, do you know...

424
00:49:16.406 --> 00:49:17.743
Do you know who
brought us here?

425
00:49:19.081 --> 00:49:21.450
Hey! Can you help us?

426
00:49:27.354 --> 00:49:30.595
Who are you?
Please. Please, please.

427
00:49:30.596 --> 00:49:32.525
Hey, hey...

428
00:49:39.936 --> 00:49:41.501
What... What are you doing?

429
00:49:47.139 --> 00:49:48.376
Hey.

430
00:49:53.286 --> 00:49:54.286
John?

431
00:49:55.454 --> 00:49:56.648
It was you?

432
00:49:57.523 --> 00:49:58.749
Why?

433
00:49:59.888 --> 00:50:01.323
Why are we here?

434
00:50:02.693 --> 00:50:03.693
John!

435
00:50:04.563 --> 00:50:06.257
What is this?

436
00:50:06.258 --> 00:50:08.528
We were only trying
to help you.

437
00:50:09.799 --> 00:50:11.394
That game is over.

438
00:50:11.395 --> 00:50:13.533
And a new game is
about to begin.

439
00:50:16.908 --> 00:50:18.403
Valentina...

440
00:50:18.404 --> 00:50:20.573
...did my blood ever
make it to the lab?

441
00:50:21.347 --> 00:50:22.708
<i>Or...</i>

442
00:50:22.709 --> 00:50:25.809
did you just suck it out and flush it down
the drain somewhere?

443
00:50:27.751 --> 00:50:29.565
Mr. Kramer. Mr. Kramer.

444
00:50:29.566 --> 00:50:31.380
Please, listen to me.
I beg you.

445
00:50:31.381 --> 00:50:33.553
I beg you, please. Please.

446
00:50:34.827 --> 00:50:36.323
We have nothing
to do with this.

447
00:50:36.324 --> 00:50:38.355
We didn't know what was
going on. It was all her.

448
00:50:38.356 --> 00:50:40.327
She planned the whole thing.

449
00:50:40.328 --> 00:50:44.527
Mateo, I don't even know
if that's your real name.

450
00:50:44.528 --> 00:50:47.435
- It is my real name.
- It is, oh.

451
00:50:48.768 --> 00:50:52.305
'Cause they have never heard
of you at the hospital.

452
00:50:52.306 --> 00:50:54.490
She told me to say that
I worked there.

453
00:50:54.491 --> 00:50:56.674
- But I don't. I'm sorry.
- Mm, mm.

454
00:50:56.675 --> 00:50:59.579
- Please wait. Let me explain.
- Mr. Kramer...

455
00:51:02.247 --> 00:51:04.549
I meant no harm.

456
00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:08.854
I would really like
to believe you, Gabriela.

457
00:51:11.192 --> 00:51:13.329
You'll have a chance
to prove yourself.

458
00:51:14.733 --> 00:51:17.597
<i>Por favor. Por favor.</i>

459
00:51:29.312 --> 00:51:32.150
The key to your freedom
is inside that box.

460
00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:37.654
What the hell is that?

461
00:51:37.655 --> 00:51:39.619
It's a Gigli saw.

462
00:51:41.026 --> 00:51:42.793
I thought you said
there was a key?

463
00:51:42.794 --> 00:51:44.859
He was speaking metaphorically.

464
00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:46.725
He does that a lot.

465
00:51:48.096 --> 00:51:50.165
When I get out of here,

466
00:51:50.166 --> 00:51:53.435
I'm gonna kill both of you
motherfuckers!

467
00:51:56.038 --> 00:51:57.601
That's a good plan.

468
00:51:57.602 --> 00:51:59.989
You're gonna wanna
really listen carefully

469
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:02.378
to the rules
in order to pull that off.

470
00:52:03.309 --> 00:52:05.348
Fuck you!

471
00:52:13.757 --> 00:52:14.786
Go ahead.

472
00:52:15.725 --> 00:52:17.290
No. No.

473
00:52:17.291 --> 00:52:18.856
What...

474
00:52:22.529 --> 00:52:24.730
No. No. What?

475
00:52:28.533 --> 00:52:31.040
The wire saw inside of that box

476
00:52:31.041 --> 00:52:33.544
was invented
by an Italian physician.

477
00:52:33.545 --> 00:52:36.279
Leonardo Gigli.

478
00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:39.581
It creates an extraordinarily
clean-cut to the bone.

479
00:52:39.582 --> 00:52:40.911
No.

480
00:52:46.185 --> 00:52:48.152
No. No, no, no, no, no!

481
00:52:48.153 --> 00:52:49.790
No, no, no, no!

482
00:52:59.798 --> 00:53:02.603
The dotted line on your leg
marks the spot.

483
00:53:03.875 --> 00:53:06.276
Are you fucking crazy?

484
00:53:06.277 --> 00:53:09.005
What makes you think
I'd fucking cut off my own leg?

485
00:53:10.443 --> 00:53:12.379
Because if you don't,

486
00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:15.418
the wire saw that's wrapped
around your neck

487
00:53:16.218 --> 00:53:18.154
will first cut into your skin,

488
00:53:18.155 --> 00:53:20.090
then your vertebral ligaments,

489
00:53:20.091 --> 00:53:22.486
and finally, it'll sever
your spinal cord.

490
00:53:22.487 --> 00:53:24.507
No.

491
00:53:24.508 --> 00:53:26.528
The CliffsNotes version?

492
00:53:27.529 --> 00:53:29.366
It's gonna
cut your head off.

493
00:53:31.471 --> 00:53:32.471
No!

494
00:53:33.872 --> 00:53:34.902
You won't.

495
00:53:34.903 --> 00:53:36.468
You wouldn't.

496
00:53:36.469 --> 00:53:38.034
Uh, it's true.

497
00:53:38.743 --> 00:53:39.743
We won't.

498
00:53:42.342 --> 00:53:43.712
But Valentina might.

499
00:53:46.079 --> 00:53:47.417
All of you...

500
00:53:51.086 --> 00:53:52.389
All of you...

501
00:53:53.957 --> 00:53:55.018
All of you...

502
00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:01.057
You promised dying people.

503
00:54:02.163 --> 00:54:03.895
Dying people!

504
00:54:07.401 --> 00:54:08.867
That you could save their lives.

505
00:54:08.868 --> 00:54:13.971
And in doing so, you took
advantage of the only thing...

506
00:54:16.641 --> 00:54:18.382
that they still possessed.

507
00:54:21.917 --> 00:54:23.548
Hope.

508
00:54:23.549 --> 00:54:26.786
No, John. We've worked
to heal people.

509
00:54:28.257 --> 00:54:31.958
Your case was... different.

510
00:54:33.491 --> 00:54:35.961
And still you lie.

511
00:54:35.962 --> 00:54:39.700
My associate, Amanda here,
has had a look at your bank records.

512
00:54:41.399 --> 00:54:42.703
Take a look.

513
00:54:46.143 --> 00:54:48.293
Who are those 34 people to you?

514
00:54:48.294 --> 00:54:50.987
John's case
was different?

515
00:54:50.988 --> 00:54:53.680
Did you heal
any of those 34 people?

516
00:54:53.681 --> 00:54:56.385
Did they have children
that are now orphaned?

517
00:54:56.386 --> 00:54:58.955
You've been doing this
larcenist dance now

518
00:54:58.956 --> 00:55:00.691
for more than eight years.

519
00:55:00.692 --> 00:55:02.519
Eight years.

520
00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.659
That's more than $8 million.

521
00:55:06.162 --> 00:55:07.962
That's a lot of pain...

522
00:55:07.963 --> 00:55:09.763
to inflict on others

523
00:55:11.035 --> 00:55:12.864
for your own enrichment.

524
00:55:12.865 --> 00:55:16.139
There was no healing
going on there, bitch.

525
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:18.842
They're all underground.
I checked.

526
00:55:18.843 --> 00:55:20.807
We know everything.

527
00:55:20.808 --> 00:55:22.771
We have everything.

528
00:55:22.772 --> 00:55:25.849
Including the cash
from your house.

529
00:55:25.850 --> 00:55:27.748
We have it upstairs.

530
00:55:30.354 --> 00:55:32.615
Please. Please,
don't do this. Please.

531
00:55:32.616 --> 00:55:34.317
Please, help me.

532
00:55:34.318 --> 00:55:35.689
Please.

533
00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:38.088
That's exactly
what we are doing, Valentina.

534
00:55:38.931 --> 00:55:40.431
This is not retribution,

535
00:55:42.165 --> 00:55:43.799
it's a reawakening.

536
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:51.640
Valentina, follow my instructions
if you want to live.

537
00:55:51.641 --> 00:55:55.045
There are more than five pounds
of marrow in the human body.

538
00:55:55.046 --> 00:55:56.479
All you need is three ounces.

539
00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:59.344
There's more than enough in your femur.

540
00:55:59.345 --> 00:56:00.647
Just suction it out,

541
00:56:00.648 --> 00:56:03.900
it'll be transferred
to that device right there

542
00:56:03.901 --> 00:56:07.153
and it will deactivate the saw
around your neck.

543
00:56:07.154 --> 00:56:08.553
Don't hesitate.

544
00:56:08.554 --> 00:56:10.694
Because your time is prescribed.

545
00:56:13.558 --> 00:56:16.331
No. No.

546
00:56:16.332 --> 00:56:18.297
Now,
refusing to play the game

547
00:56:18.298 --> 00:56:19.915
is not an option.

548
00:56:19.916 --> 00:56:21.532
If you refuse...

549
00:56:21.533 --> 00:56:23.333
you will remain in this room...

550
00:56:25.271 --> 00:56:26.477
Forever.

551
00:56:28.377 --> 00:56:30.110
You'll make it.

552
00:56:30.111 --> 00:56:31.845
So long as you keep your head.

553
00:56:33.145 --> 00:56:35.283
We were not involved
in the whole thing.

554
00:56:36.518 --> 00:56:38.753
- Please.
- John! Please.

555
00:56:41.421 --> 00:56:43.188
This is not right.

556
00:56:43.189 --> 00:56:44.561
Not right?

557
00:56:46.758 --> 00:56:48.928
A lecture in moral decency?

558
00:56:50.066 --> 00:56:51.095
From you?

559
00:56:54.337 --> 00:56:55.965
No, no, John. John!

560
00:56:55.966 --> 00:56:58.476
Please, wait, John!

561
00:56:59.173 --> 00:57:00.173
John!

562
00:57:00.944 --> 00:57:02.111
John!

563
00:57:02.112 --> 00:57:04.078
Please, please, please, help me.

564
00:57:08.552 --> 00:57:09.778
John, please wait!

565
00:57:09.779 --> 00:57:11.181
Please wait! Please wait!

566
00:57:21.132 --> 00:57:22.758
<i>What do we do?</i>

567
00:57:35.044 --> 00:57:36.472
John!

568
00:57:36.473 --> 00:57:40.914
John, please wait!
You don't have to do this! John! John!

569
00:57:41.919 --> 00:57:43.283
No, no.

570
00:57:43.284 --> 00:57:44.822
Valentina, look at me.

571
00:57:44.823 --> 00:57:45.853
Look at me!

572
00:57:46.387 --> 00:57:47.551
You can do this.

573
00:57:47.552 --> 00:57:49.254
No, no, no, I can't! No.

574
00:57:49.255 --> 00:57:50.958
You have to do this!

575
00:57:50.959 --> 00:57:52.159
No!

576
00:57:53.330 --> 00:57:55.896
Valentina,
come on! Do it!

577
00:57:56.802 --> 00:57:57.865
Okay.

578
00:58:05.044 --> 00:58:06.302
You can do it.

579
00:58:10.529 --> 00:58:12.143
Oh, my God! No!

580
00:58:15.482 --> 00:58:17.687
No, no, no, no, no! No, no, no!

581
00:58:18.583 --> 00:58:19.922
Oh, my God.

582
00:58:20.918 --> 00:58:22.685
- The tourniquet.
- No, no!

583
00:58:22.686 --> 00:58:23.939
Put it on.

584
00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:25.383
Goddamn it! Valentina.

585
00:58:25.384 --> 00:58:26.828
The tourniquet, put it on!

586
00:58:27.833 --> 00:58:29.327
Faster!

587
00:58:33.335 --> 00:58:34.533
You can do this.

588
00:58:34.534 --> 00:58:36.838
You can do this!

589
00:58:37.669 --> 00:58:38.939
Now, the wire saw.

590
00:58:40.277 --> 00:58:41.579
Wrap it under your leg.

591
00:58:43.043 --> 00:58:45.814
If Diego could do this,
you can do this.

592
00:58:46.819 --> 00:58:47.819
Okay.

593
00:58:48.916 --> 00:58:51.353
Come on.

594
00:58:51.354 --> 00:58:54.155
You have to. Save yourself!

595
00:58:58.029 --> 00:58:59.656
Oh, my God!

596
00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:11.033
I can't! I can't!

597
00:59:11.034 --> 00:59:13.141
Don't stop, don't think!
Just do it!

598
00:59:13.142 --> 00:59:14.645
No!

599
00:59:23.086 --> 00:59:24.582
Come on!

600
00:59:24.583 --> 00:59:26.690
Faster.

601
00:59:29.058 --> 00:59:32.930
Do it, don't think. Keep going.
You're gonna die. Come on!

602
00:59:35.399 --> 00:59:37.395
You're running
out of time!

603
00:59:37.396 --> 00:59:38.702
Come on.

604
00:59:39.302 --> 00:59:40.396
Fuck. Come on!

605
00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:43.000
Faster.

606
00:59:43.001 --> 00:59:46.174
Come on. Faster!
Keep going until it's off!

607
00:59:46.175 --> 00:59:48.041
No!

608
00:59:56.245 --> 00:59:58.955
For God's sake, Valentina,
save yourself!

609
01:00:18.339 --> 01:00:19.369
Go on.

610
01:00:24.545 --> 01:00:26.981
Okay, okay, okay.

611
01:00:26.982 --> 01:00:29.819
You're running out of time!

612
01:00:30.852 --> 01:00:32.684
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

613
01:00:32.685 --> 01:00:33.886
You're doing great.

614
01:00:33.887 --> 01:00:35.825
You're doing great.

615
01:00:56.014 --> 01:00:57.176
Please.

616
01:01:09.187 --> 01:01:11.022
I'm not gonna make it.

617
01:01:11.023 --> 01:01:12.858
No, no, no! I'm no
going to make it!

618
01:01:12.859 --> 01:01:15.494
Oh, my God. No. No. No.

619
01:01:15.495 --> 01:01:17.933
No, no, no, no!

620
01:01:18.764 --> 01:01:21.467
No, no, no, no!

621
01:01:21.468 --> 01:01:24.171
No. No, no, no!

622
01:01:24.172 --> 01:01:25.638
No!

623
01:01:25.639 --> 01:01:28.141
No!

624
01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:45.224
Oh, fuck.

625
01:02:00.806 --> 01:02:02.473
Help!

626
01:02:02.474 --> 01:02:04.140
<i>Help!</i>

627
01:02:04.141 --> 01:02:05.607
<i>This is all
your fault.</i>

628
01:02:05.608 --> 01:02:08.043
<i>You brought me into this.
You brought me into this!</i>

629
01:02:08.044 --> 01:02:09.952
<i>Get it together, Gabby!</i>

630
01:02:10.419 --> 01:02:12.050
<i>Oh, no...</i>

631
01:02:12.051 --> 01:02:14.423
<i>I'm not the one addicted
to Oxy, am I?</i>

632
01:02:20.265 --> 01:02:21.458
Gabriela's next.

633
01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:27.966
What?

634
01:02:27.967 --> 01:02:31.006
Sometimes we get
sucked into things that

635
01:02:32.773 --> 01:02:34.138
are against our nature.

636
01:02:34.139 --> 01:02:38.816
Drugs are as vicious
as they are powerful.

637
01:02:39.549 --> 01:02:41.313
We all have free will.

638
01:02:42.014 --> 01:02:44.814
Gabriela had her own free will.

639
01:02:44.815 --> 01:02:48.826
And if you can't handle this,
how will you handle the rest of our work?

640
01:03:11.411 --> 01:03:13.813
- They're not looking.
- Why don't we use the...

641
01:03:13.814 --> 01:03:16.197
- Our clothes to tie them and take it...
- Yes, yes.

642
01:03:16.198 --> 01:03:18.581
- Yes, yes, yes, we can do that.
- We need a rope.

643
01:03:22.221 --> 01:03:24.191
Do you want to keep going?

644
01:03:25.196 --> 01:03:26.196
Yes.

645
01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:27.865
The pain...

646
01:03:28.862 --> 01:03:30.359
just comes in waves.

647
01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:33.299
Listen, I'm not ready
to do this without you.

648
01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.334
You are ready.

649
01:03:36.475 --> 01:03:38.370
You are ready and you can.

650
01:04:04.462 --> 01:04:07.564
Cecilia. Cecilia,
what are you doing?

651
01:04:12.611 --> 01:04:14.171
Cecilia,
don't touch her!

652
01:04:14.172 --> 01:04:17.013
- Shh.
- Cecilia, don't touch her.

653
01:04:17.844 --> 01:04:19.213
Stop.

654
01:04:21.881 --> 01:04:23.415
No, no.

655
01:04:26.288 --> 01:04:28.918
Right now, Amanda, these people
deserve to be tested.

656
01:04:28.919 --> 01:04:31.020
That lady doctor

657
01:04:31.021 --> 01:04:33.122
deserves nothing.

658
01:04:33.123 --> 01:04:35.060
Everyone deserves a chance.

659
01:04:35.061 --> 01:04:37.561
An opportunity
to redeem themselves.

660
01:04:38.837 --> 01:04:40.971
You should know that
more than anyone.

661
01:04:45.375 --> 01:04:46.375
Hmm.

662
01:04:53.418 --> 01:04:54.814
Cecilia.

663
01:04:54.815 --> 01:04:56.467
Cecilia, what the fuck is that?

664
01:04:56.468 --> 01:04:58.120
Cecilia, what are you doing?

665
01:05:06.058 --> 01:05:08.559
No... No. No. Wait!

666
01:05:09.434 --> 01:05:11.727
- No! No!
- Shh.

667
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:19.471
Ugh.

668
01:05:34.019 --> 01:05:35.183
We have a rope.

669
01:05:35.184 --> 01:05:37.588
- No!
- Mateo!

670
01:05:38.957 --> 01:05:40.360
Fine, fine.

671
01:05:53.441 --> 01:05:57.047
Okay. Yes, you can loop it
around the table and...

672
01:05:57.878 --> 01:05:59.145
And pull it in.

673
01:06:08.190 --> 01:06:10.724
Yes, yes.

674
01:06:24.676 --> 01:06:26.872
- Pick up, pick up.
- Yeah.

675
01:06:31.811 --> 01:06:32.975
No!

676
01:06:35.783 --> 01:06:38.385
No! No, no!

677
01:07:10.315 --> 01:07:12.818
Listen. Just listen.

678
01:07:12.819 --> 01:07:14.124
You're right.

679
01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:16.423
I'm a total fraud.

680
01:07:19.158 --> 01:07:20.844
But my father, John,

681
01:07:20.845 --> 01:07:22.571
he's the real deal.

682
01:07:22.572 --> 01:07:24.299
And you know that.

683
01:07:25.570 --> 01:07:27.031
He can save you.

684
01:07:27.032 --> 01:07:28.501
Is that your concern?

685
01:07:30.739 --> 01:07:31.804
Saving me?

686
01:07:31.805 --> 01:07:33.341
But he can heal you.

687
01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:36.074
I swear to God.

688
01:07:36.075 --> 01:07:38.141
That's who I was
trying to call.

689
01:07:38.142 --> 01:07:39.576
Let me talk to him.

690
01:07:39.577 --> 01:07:42.344
Let me tell him where we are
and he will come.

691
01:07:42.345 --> 01:07:44.718
He will come help you.

692
01:07:44.719 --> 01:07:46.189
To save my life.

693
01:07:47.688 --> 01:07:50.688
Begging won't help. Trust me,
you're not the first to try.

694
01:08:01.637 --> 01:08:04.467
Please.

695
01:08:04.468 --> 01:08:07.070
Please, please.
Please help. Please.

696
01:08:07.071 --> 01:08:08.871
Please, please.

697
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.600
John, we have a visitor.

698
01:08:42.573 --> 01:08:44.812
<i>Open this fucking door!</i>

699
01:08:44.813 --> 01:08:46.549
<i>It's Parker Sears!</i>

700
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:48.744
<i>I've come to get my money back
and I'm not going until I get it!</i>

701
01:08:48.745 --> 01:08:51.452
- Help! Hey!
<i>- Pederson, you thief!</i>

702
01:09:35.963 --> 01:09:37.696
Oh, fuck.

703
01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:55.714
Hey.

704
01:09:58.052 --> 01:10:00.620
Hey! What is this?

705
01:10:04.659 --> 01:10:07.862
Walk in with a gun,
get treated like a criminal.

706
01:10:09.732 --> 01:10:10.762
Who are you?

707
01:10:12.566 --> 01:10:14.997
I was gonna ask you
the same question.

708
01:10:18.909 --> 01:10:20.808
I know you. Kramer.

709
01:10:20.809 --> 01:10:22.708
Brain cancer, right?

710
01:10:28.416 --> 01:10:30.084
What are you
doing here, Parker?

711
01:10:30.085 --> 01:10:31.882
I came to get my money back.

712
01:10:33.683 --> 01:10:35.757
These people are just crooks.

713
01:10:35.758 --> 01:10:37.052
Look at this.

714
01:10:38.596 --> 01:10:39.692
Ah.

715
01:10:40.532 --> 01:10:41.628
Hmm...

716
01:10:42.292 --> 01:10:43.498
Yeah.

717
01:10:57.276 --> 01:10:58.612
Is that Pederson?

718
01:10:59.376 --> 01:11:00.581
And Mateo.

719
01:11:01.947 --> 01:11:06.081
Gabriela, Valentina,
and Diego was in on it too.

720
01:11:06.957 --> 01:11:08.490
They're all con artists.

721
01:11:09.422 --> 01:11:12.354
And we, we were the suckers.

722
01:11:12.355 --> 01:11:14.361
That bitch.

723
01:11:14.362 --> 01:11:17.496
I gave her everything.
All the money I had.

724
01:11:17.497 --> 01:11:19.666
That was for my family,
that money.

725
01:11:20.799 --> 01:11:24.167
To make good with my kids
when I was gone.

726
01:11:24.168 --> 01:11:27.536
But instead,
you traded it for magic beans.

727
01:11:27.537 --> 01:11:31.774
More time, a shot at life.

728
01:11:31.775 --> 01:11:33.809
What's your life
really mean to you, Parker?

729
01:11:33.810 --> 01:11:35.614
Have you ever thought
about that?

730
01:11:35.615 --> 01:11:38.113
Because if you find
the meaning of your life,

731
01:11:39.617 --> 01:11:41.556
what you've found is your soul.

732
01:11:43.054 --> 01:11:45.758
We have your money.
You can be assured of that.

733
01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:49.190
But before I let you
confront Cecilia,

734
01:11:49.191 --> 01:11:52.831
there's a game that she has to
play out to its conclusion.

735
01:11:54.268 --> 01:11:55.669
What do you mean a game?

736
01:11:59.106 --> 01:12:00.139
Oh, God...

737
01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:02.239
You killed Valentina.

738
01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.706
We don't kill.

739
01:12:04.707 --> 01:12:06.879
You chopped her
fucking head off!

740
01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:10.281
Valentina died
because she didn't have the will to live.

741
01:12:10.282 --> 01:12:11.717
She failed her test.

742
01:12:11.718 --> 01:12:15.891
John, if he found us here,
others might too, and soon.

743
01:12:15.892 --> 01:12:18.225
We're wasting time.

744
01:12:18.226 --> 01:12:20.689
I'm just trying
to give Mr. Sears

745
01:12:20.690 --> 01:12:22.897
a chance to make his choice.

746
01:12:22.898 --> 01:12:24.830
What choice?

747
01:12:24.831 --> 01:12:27.533
I don't have a choice. What are
you two fucking talking about?

748
01:12:27.534 --> 01:12:29.403
I'm going to give you
an opportunity

749
01:12:29.404 --> 01:12:33.102
to do something significant
with your life.

750
01:12:34.878 --> 01:12:36.039
Right now.

751
01:12:37.012 --> 01:12:37.972
I'm listening.

752
01:12:37.973 --> 01:12:40.681
But first, I'm going to
have to insist...

753
01:12:41.983 --> 01:12:43.079
no guns.

754
01:12:50.994 --> 01:12:53.020
Rules are rules.

755
01:12:53.021 --> 01:12:55.897
Consequences for
breaking them will be dire.

756
01:12:55.898 --> 01:12:57.159
Understood?

757
01:12:59.870 --> 01:13:01.504
Undo me now?

758
01:13:05.875 --> 01:13:06.875
John.

759
01:13:13.544 --> 01:13:15.145
I promise you, Amanda.

760
01:13:15.146 --> 01:13:19.456
One way or another,
it's all gonna work out according to plan.

761
01:13:20.988 --> 01:13:24.692
Why don't you go and prepare
Gabriela for the next game?

762
01:13:28.231 --> 01:13:30.863
- You want me to do it?
- No.

763
01:13:41.146 --> 01:13:43.480
But the anesthesiologist
is next.

764
01:13:48.012 --> 01:13:50.015
Lady, can you
talk to me, please?

765
01:13:50.016 --> 01:13:52.020
Can you... Can you
please talk to me?

766
01:13:52.021 --> 01:13:53.418
Please talk to me.

767
01:13:53.419 --> 01:13:54.816
You fucking bitch!

768
01:13:54.817 --> 01:13:56.993
You fucking cunt!

769
01:14:07.697 --> 01:14:10.568
Help me, help me.
Help me. Please.

770
01:14:10.569 --> 01:14:12.239
Believe it or not, I just did.

771
01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:13.975
- You were next.
- He's a monster.

772
01:14:13.976 --> 01:14:15.637
He's gonna kill you the same way
he's gonna kill all of us. Please...

773
01:14:15.638 --> 01:14:17.173
You don't know John.

774
01:14:17.174 --> 01:14:20.682
If you want any more of my help,
keep your mouth shut about that.

775
01:14:36.766 --> 01:14:39.162
Is that so I don't shoot that
thief in the face?

776
01:14:42.766 --> 01:14:44.769
Trust me, Mr. Sears.

777
01:14:44.770 --> 01:14:47.544
In short order,
she'll wish that you had.

778
01:15:07.095 --> 01:15:08.095
Mateo.

779
01:15:12.067 --> 01:15:13.067
Fuck.

780
01:15:33.055 --> 01:15:34.283
What...

781
01:15:38.062 --> 01:15:40.058
Ah...

782
01:15:41.396 --> 01:15:42.962
What the fuck is that?

783
01:16:06.289 --> 01:16:08.051
What is it? What is it?

784
01:16:08.052 --> 01:16:10.654
I don't know what the fuck
all of these things are.

785
01:16:10.655 --> 01:16:12.361
Medical supplies, I think.

786
01:16:12.362 --> 01:16:14.722
And there's
a fucking bone cutter.

787
01:16:14.723 --> 01:16:16.193
A craniotome.

788
01:16:16.194 --> 01:16:19.196
I don't care what the fucking
thing is called, Cecilia!

789
01:16:20.164 --> 01:16:22.271
There's this thing
that says "Play me."

790
01:16:22.272 --> 01:16:23.636
I'm not gonna touch that thing.

791
01:16:27.275 --> 01:16:28.810
Fine. Fine.

792
01:16:32.515 --> 01:16:33.914
<i>Hello, Mateo.</i>

793
01:16:34.714 --> 01:16:36.815
<i>It's time to play a game.</i>

794
01:16:36.816 --> 01:16:38.917
<i>The rules are simple.</i>

795
01:16:38.918 --> 01:16:42.289
<i>Place a big enough piece
of your cerebral tissue</i>

796
01:16:42.290 --> 01:16:45.662
<i>into the glass enzyme tank
and you win.</i>

797
01:16:46.493 --> 01:16:47.593
A piece of what?

798
01:16:47.594 --> 01:16:50.095
- A piece of what?
- Gray matter.

799
01:16:50.729 --> 01:16:52.130
What does that mean?

800
01:16:52.731 --> 01:16:54.101
A piece of your brain.

801
01:16:54.102 --> 01:16:57.537
- This is insane.
- Kramer!

802
01:16:57.538 --> 01:17:00.974
<i>John, please!</i>

803
01:17:03.343 --> 01:17:04.512
<i>Kramer!</i>

804
01:17:04.513 --> 01:17:05.682
Please!

805
01:17:08.646 --> 01:17:12.716
<i>If you complete your task
in less than three minutes,</i>

806
01:17:12.717 --> 01:17:16.787
<i>the enzymes will dissolve
the tissue to close a circuit.</i>

807
01:17:16.788 --> 01:17:18.774
<i>This will save your life.</i>

808
01:17:18.775 --> 01:17:20.760
<i>But know this.</i>

809
01:17:20.761 --> 01:17:23.995
<i>The brain is a remarkably
resilient organ.</i>

810
01:17:23.996 --> 01:17:26.933
<i>There have been accounts
of people undergoing</i>

811
01:17:26.934 --> 01:17:29.871
<i>complete anatomical hemispherectomies.</i>

812
01:17:29.872 --> 01:17:34.442
<i>Half their brain removed,
only to have it rewire itself,</i>

813
01:17:34.443 --> 01:17:39.014
<i>so that the patient
not only survives, but thrives.</i>

814
01:17:39.015 --> 01:17:40.414
Ah...

815
01:17:40.415 --> 01:17:41.881
I don't know how to do this.

816
01:17:41.882 --> 01:17:43.778
I don't know how to do that.

817
01:17:46.221 --> 01:17:49.124
Okay...

818
01:17:49.125 --> 01:17:53.421
<i>The only thing
I have not provided is your anesthetic.</i>

819
01:17:53.422 --> 01:17:58.064
<i>But trust me,
you will want to remain alert.</i>

820
01:17:58.731 --> 01:18:00.360
<i>And if you fail to act,</i>

821
01:18:00.361 --> 01:18:04.305
<i>the consequences
will not go well for you.</i>

822
01:18:04.306 --> 01:18:07.135
<i>Do not waste time.</i>

823
01:18:07.136 --> 01:18:10.607
<i>Live or die,
the choice is yours.</i>

824
01:18:16.087 --> 01:18:17.087
No, no, no.

825
01:18:18.048 --> 01:18:20.188
I need to take this thing off.

826
01:18:23.658 --> 01:18:25.121
- Somebody help me.
- Mateo.

827
01:18:25.122 --> 01:18:27.528
What do I do? What do I do?
What do I do?

828
01:18:27.529 --> 01:18:29.179
You have to use the craniotome.

829
01:18:30.831 --> 01:18:32.700
Yes, Mateo, you have to.

830
01:18:32.701 --> 01:18:34.931
That is not going to
fucking happen.

831
01:18:34.932 --> 01:18:36.568
You have to cut into your scalp.

832
01:18:36.569 --> 01:18:37.950
- No. No.
- Yes!

833
01:18:39.333 --> 01:18:41.352
I can't do it.
I can't...

834
01:18:41.353 --> 01:18:43.373
Do you want to live?
Or wind up like her?

835
01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:47.949
- Mateo!
- Okay.

836
01:18:52.454 --> 01:18:53.482
Is there a cable?

837
01:18:54.753 --> 01:18:56.521
Is this it?

838
01:18:56.522 --> 01:18:57.820
This is it.

839
01:18:57.821 --> 01:18:59.257
Yes.

840
01:19:07.705 --> 01:19:10.840
Just do it.

841
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:19.085
Faster!

842
01:20:37.924 --> 01:20:40.329
Oh, my God. Oh... Oh, my God.

843
01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.418
Pull it out!

844
01:20:52.739 --> 01:20:54.704
Ah!

845
01:20:54.705 --> 01:20:56.671
Dig it out! Do it!

846
01:21:15.364 --> 01:21:16.364
Oh...

847
01:21:24.135 --> 01:21:26.701
No!

848
01:21:36.851 --> 01:21:38.482
No!

849
01:21:46.693 --> 01:21:49.064
No! Mateo!

850
01:22:01.975 --> 01:22:03.705
You guys are fucking sick.

851
01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:06.241
We're sick?

852
01:22:06.242 --> 01:22:09.216
These people kill
with false hope.

853
01:22:25.633 --> 01:22:29.104
What if there is something
her father can do to help you?

854
01:22:29.770 --> 01:22:31.455
Amanda, you know

855
01:22:31.456 --> 01:22:33.140
as well as I do...

856
01:22:33.141 --> 01:22:36.744
people will say almost anything
to save their own life.

857
01:22:36.745 --> 01:22:38.678
Yeah, but her father's real.

858
01:22:38.679 --> 01:22:39.976
We both know that.

859
01:22:39.977 --> 01:22:42.183
Amanda, the reality is...

860
01:22:43.717 --> 01:22:44.717
I'm dying.

861
01:22:46.687 --> 01:22:48.105
I am dying.

862
01:22:49.525 --> 01:22:50.823
You have to face that.

863
01:22:50.824 --> 01:22:52.523
But our work's not gonna end.

864
01:22:53.829 --> 01:22:57.759
And I'm trust... trusting you...

865
01:23:01.372 --> 01:23:02.401
to carry on.

866
01:23:33.902 --> 01:23:35.603
It's almost morning.

867
01:23:35.604 --> 01:23:37.605
We have a job to do.

868
01:23:37.606 --> 01:23:39.401
We're running out of time.

869
01:23:39.402 --> 01:23:43.475
I want you to go
and free Mr. Sears.

870
01:23:45.146 --> 01:23:47.116
And see if he'll play
by the rules.

871
01:23:59.726 --> 01:24:02.026
No.

872
01:24:02.027 --> 01:24:04.859
Gabriela, you have to take it.

873
01:24:05.963 --> 01:24:07.066
No.

874
01:24:07.067 --> 01:24:09.798
We'll never get
out of here otherwise.

875
01:24:25.986 --> 01:24:28.256
<i>What was that?</i>

876
01:24:30.187 --> 01:24:31.391
<i>What's that?</i>

877
01:24:38.298 --> 01:24:39.762
<i>Hello, Gabriela.</i>

878
01:24:40.869 --> 01:24:42.097
<i>I want to play a game...</i>

879
01:24:42.098 --> 01:24:43.800
No, no, stop it!

880
01:24:43.801 --> 01:24:45.504
Stop it. Stop it...

881
01:24:47.604 --> 01:24:49.673
I'm afraid that's not
going to work.

882
01:24:51.246 --> 01:24:53.710
<i>You are going to
have to play the game.</i>

883
01:25:22.306 --> 01:25:25.745
No! No, no, no, no, no!

884
01:25:25.746 --> 01:25:26.941
What the fuck?

885
01:25:55.639 --> 01:25:57.305
<i>Although
you all pretended</i>

886
01:25:57.306 --> 01:25:59.847
to cure my cancer,

887
01:25:59.848 --> 01:26:02.578
I have spent years in treatment.

888
01:26:02.579 --> 01:26:05.913
<i>Chemotherapy,
immunotherapy, radiation.</i>

889
01:26:05.914 --> 01:26:09.587
<i>Radiation machines
are not to be trifled with.</i>

890
01:26:09.588 --> 01:26:13.262
So, follow my instructions
carefully, Gabriela.

891
01:26:20.196 --> 01:26:21.435
Fuck.

892
01:26:25.105 --> 01:26:30.411
<i>The only way out is to free your hand
and ankle from the shackles.</i>

893
01:26:31.045 --> 01:26:33.311
<i>Use the tool above you.</i>

894
01:26:33.312 --> 01:26:34.981
No! No, you can't!

895
01:26:34.982 --> 01:26:36.534
You can't! Let me out!

896
01:26:36.535 --> 01:26:38.086
Let me out!

897
01:26:38.087 --> 01:26:42.107
Broken bones heal.
Flesh can be grafted.

898
01:26:42.108 --> 01:26:46.127
<i>This will not be easy,
but then,</i>

899
01:26:46.128 --> 01:26:50.094
nothing worth having,
like life, ever is.

900
01:27:00.174 --> 01:27:02.089
You have to take it, Gabby.

901
01:27:06.343 --> 01:27:07.375
Do it.

902
01:27:07.376 --> 01:27:09.144
You have to do it, Gabby.

903
01:27:28.004 --> 01:27:29.299
No, no, no, no, no!

904
01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:30.531
Start with your foot.

905
01:27:30.532 --> 01:27:32.341
You'll swing out of the way.

906
01:27:35.876 --> 01:27:36.906
Okay, Gabby.

907
01:28:17.348 --> 01:28:18.730
You did it, Gabby.

908
01:28:29.666 --> 01:28:30.666
No.

909
01:28:32.966 --> 01:28:34.502
No. No.

910
01:28:37.775 --> 01:28:41.634
No. No, no. No.

911
01:28:41.635 --> 01:28:44.208
Stop it. Please.

912
01:28:44.209 --> 01:28:46.943
Don't stop. Gabby!

913
01:29:28.189 --> 01:29:29.604
Drop her at a hospital.

914
01:29:29.605 --> 01:29:31.020
Okay, play time's over.

915
01:29:33.461 --> 01:29:35.459
Give me the keys.

916
01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:37.824
I stated to you very clearly,

917
01:29:37.825 --> 01:29:40.936
that guns were
against the rules.

918
01:29:40.937 --> 01:29:42.597
Fuck your rules, John.

919
01:29:42.598 --> 01:29:44.801
The keys to Cecilia's chains.

920
01:29:44.802 --> 01:29:48.075
You don't need the keys.
She's not going anywhere.

921
01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:00.020
Now, move.

922
01:30:21.472 --> 01:30:23.611
Come on. Move.

923
01:30:29.683 --> 01:30:31.245
I thought
you forgot about me.

924
01:30:32.450 --> 01:30:33.516
Not a chance.

925
01:30:33.517 --> 01:30:35.249
You know I'd die for you, baby.

926
01:30:41.458 --> 01:30:42.795
Unlock her.

927
01:30:44.031 --> 01:30:45.031
Now!

928
01:31:03.687 --> 01:31:07.215
I've been wanting to do that
since the moment I met you.

929
01:31:12.857 --> 01:31:15.289
Come on, old man.
Lock yourself in.

930
01:31:25.569 --> 01:31:26.872
Come on, move!

931
01:32:03.881 --> 01:32:05.038
New game.

932
01:32:05.039 --> 01:32:08.983
It's called we live,
you die, fuck you.

933
01:32:08.984 --> 01:32:10.177
Simple enough?

934
01:32:10.178 --> 01:32:12.550
I told you
Parker would break the rules.

935
01:32:12.551 --> 01:32:14.350
You failed your test, asshole.

936
01:32:15.422 --> 01:32:17.453
We need to get her
to a hospital.

937
01:32:17.454 --> 01:32:19.423
She won her game

938
01:32:19.424 --> 01:32:21.260
and she deserves to live.

939
01:32:21.261 --> 01:32:22.928
Oh, does she now?

940
01:32:23.862 --> 01:32:26.294
Her injuries need
medical treatment.

941
01:32:27.365 --> 01:32:28.703
Do they?

942
01:32:34.736 --> 01:32:36.612
Don't even think about it!

943
01:32:38.148 --> 01:32:40.297
No, no, no, no.

944
01:32:40.298 --> 01:32:42.446
No, no, no, no, no!

945
01:32:45.385 --> 01:32:47.821
You sick bitch!

946
01:32:51.318 --> 01:32:55.763
Unfortunately, I don't think
she's gonna make it.

947
01:32:58.180 --> 01:32:59.734
Parker.

948
01:33:02.336 --> 01:33:03.336
Give me the keys.

949
01:33:14.447 --> 01:33:15.717
Lock yourself in.

950
01:33:48.417 --> 01:33:49.850
So, tell me, John.

951
01:33:49.851 --> 01:33:53.253
You've been doing this for a
very long time, haven't you?

952
01:33:53.254 --> 01:33:54.415
How did I stop you?

953
01:33:55.555 --> 01:33:57.803
Am I just that good?

954
01:33:57.804 --> 01:34:00.052
Don't flatter yourself.

955
01:34:00.053 --> 01:34:02.138
I just had a lapse in judgement.

956
01:34:02.139 --> 01:34:04.223
- That's all.
- Yeah, I agree.

957
01:34:04.224 --> 01:34:06.559
For a guy as smart
as you are, John,

958
01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:09.930
you kind of overplayed your hand here,
wouldn't you say?

959
01:34:09.931 --> 01:34:11.198
You don't give a shit

960
01:34:11.199 --> 01:34:13.337
that all your friends are dead
because of you?

961
01:34:13.338 --> 01:34:14.468
Friends?

962
01:34:16.277 --> 01:34:17.742
Not friends.

963
01:34:17.743 --> 01:34:19.907
They were loose ends, sweetheart.

964
01:34:19.908 --> 01:34:22.081
Nothing but loose ends.

965
01:34:22.082 --> 01:34:25.886
Do you want to know what I thought
when I watched them each die?

966
01:34:26.919 --> 01:34:29.684
One less person
to split the money with.

967
01:34:29.685 --> 01:34:31.587
So, thank you.

968
01:34:31.588 --> 01:34:32.989
You did me a favor.

969
01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:35.423
You're gonna have to get
the money back from me,

970
01:34:36.366 --> 01:34:38.566
before you two can split it.

971
01:34:38.567 --> 01:34:40.398
I think
we'll get the money back.

972
01:34:40.399 --> 01:34:41.835
It's upstairs.

973
01:34:41.836 --> 01:34:44.403
You know she's eventually
gonna kill you, too, right?

974
01:34:44.404 --> 01:34:45.888
Fuck off, Amanda.

975
01:34:45.889 --> 01:34:47.461
Amanda's right.

976
01:34:47.462 --> 01:34:49.034
She's gonna burn you.

977
01:34:49.035 --> 01:34:50.837
You just can't see it yet.

978
01:34:50.838 --> 01:34:52.305
God...

979
01:34:52.306 --> 01:34:55.058
Is that really
all you've got left, John?

980
01:34:55.059 --> 01:34:57.812
When I realized
who you really were...

981
01:34:57.813 --> 01:34:59.447
Jig-fucking-saw...

982
01:35:01.390 --> 01:35:02.824
I got a bit worried.

983
01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:05.491
God's honest.

984
01:35:05.492 --> 01:35:07.990
And now, the great John Kramer

985
01:35:07.991 --> 01:35:10.463
is gonna die
in one of his own traps.

986
01:35:10.464 --> 01:35:13.132
There's some wicked irony.

987
01:35:13.133 --> 01:35:16.497
And the crazy thing is,
that you could have just walked away.

988
01:35:17.939 --> 01:35:21.403
Acknowledged that you
got beat, got conned.

989
01:35:22.673 --> 01:35:23.878
But, no...

990
01:35:25.616 --> 01:35:28.146
You just had to come back,
didn't you?

991
01:35:30.481 --> 01:35:33.385
Why don't we put this bitch
on the other side of that thing

992
01:35:33.386 --> 01:35:35.021
and press play?

993
01:35:55.945 --> 01:35:59.780
You know, this fucking asshole
is dead in two months,

994
01:35:59.781 --> 01:36:03.445
but I want him to suffer
like he made me suffer.

995
01:36:03.446 --> 01:36:07.554
I want his last memory to be
watching someone innocent die.

996
01:36:07.555 --> 01:36:09.617
If you think I'm innocent...

997
01:36:09.618 --> 01:36:10.958
You?

998
01:36:11.690 --> 01:36:13.056
Not for a second.

999
01:36:16.862 --> 01:36:18.493
But I think I hear an answer.

1000
01:36:26.676 --> 01:36:28.490
<i>- Hey, Carlos.
- Hi.</i>

1001
01:36:28.491 --> 01:36:30.305
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1002
01:36:30.306 --> 01:36:33.141
<i>I've got some friends
I want you to meet.</i>

1003
01:36:33.142 --> 01:36:35.646
<i>- Wanna come inside?
- Okay.</i>

1004
01:36:35.647 --> 01:36:36.918
<i>Come on.</i>

1005
01:36:40.819 --> 01:36:42.190
Here we are.

1006
01:36:46.362 --> 01:36:48.028
Look who I found.

1007
01:36:57.340 --> 01:36:58.536
John...

1008
01:36:58.537 --> 01:37:00.085
Who is that?

1009
01:37:00.086 --> 01:37:01.635
A friend.

1010
01:37:04.439 --> 01:37:08.147
And a terrible,
unforeseen consequence.

1011
01:37:17.053 --> 01:37:18.619
Please, don't do this.

1012
01:37:20.324 --> 01:37:23.492
- The boy is innocent.
- Exactly.

1013
01:37:24.426 --> 01:37:27.903
So, if you let him die,
it's all on you.

1014
01:37:32.203 --> 01:37:34.557
How do we get
this thing started?

1015
01:37:34.558 --> 01:37:36.912
It's activated by the subject.

1016
01:37:38.646 --> 01:37:40.939
Of course.

1017
01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:44.183
Because you wouldn't be
responsible for killing anyone, would you?

1018
01:37:44.882 --> 01:37:46.747
Fucking hypocrite.

1019
01:37:46.748 --> 01:37:49.984
Well, you might want to tell
the kid the rules before we start.

1020
01:37:49.985 --> 01:37:51.421
He's not a player.

1021
01:37:53.594 --> 01:37:54.960
In any of this.

1022
01:37:54.961 --> 01:37:56.327
Oh, come on, John.

1023
01:37:57.434 --> 01:37:59.461
Do the scary voice.

1024
01:37:59.462 --> 01:38:02.432
"I'd like to play a game."

1025
01:38:02.967 --> 01:38:04.170
No?

1026
01:38:06.076 --> 01:38:08.908
You really want the boy to play
without hearing the rules?

1027
01:38:08.909 --> 01:38:11.345
I don't think
he's gonna fare well.

1028
01:38:16.982 --> 01:38:19.548
John, I will cut his throat!

1029
01:38:45.448 --> 01:38:47.275
This is not right.

1030
01:38:47.276 --> 01:38:50.345
- It's not right.
- Oh, really?

1031
01:38:50.346 --> 01:38:53.415
A lecture on moral decency
from you?

1032
01:38:53.416 --> 01:38:56.683
You've got ten seconds,
or I hit the lever myself.

1033
01:38:56.684 --> 01:39:00.094
And I don't have a silly
moral code like you, trust me.

1034
01:39:03.861 --> 01:39:05.198
Carlos...

1035
01:39:11.605 --> 01:39:12.605
<i>Comprende?</i>

1036
01:39:18.344 --> 01:39:20.708
Turn it on,
Parker, and let's go.

1037
01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:31.389
No <i>jalar.</i>

1038
01:40:33.151 --> 01:40:34.749
No, no!

1039
01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:39.490
No.

1040
01:41:06.854 --> 01:41:08.453
Not waterboarding, huh?

1041
01:41:09.493 --> 01:41:10.688
Blood-boarding.

1042
01:42:10.083 --> 01:42:13.188
No <i>jalar,</i> Carlos! No <i>jalar!</i>

1043
01:42:26.769 --> 01:42:28.698
Stop! Stop!

1044
01:42:32.068 --> 01:42:33.472
Stop!

1045
01:42:35.478 --> 01:42:37.272
Stop!

1046
01:42:41.345 --> 01:42:44.149
Stop it, you're killing him!

1047
01:42:44.150 --> 01:42:46.852
All he has to do is
push the lever,

1048
01:42:46.853 --> 01:42:47.948
sacrifice the kid.

1049
01:42:55.590 --> 01:42:57.232
Let's go and get the money.

1050
01:43:13.274 --> 01:43:17.245
Once I heard your voice over that speaker,
I knew I'd be fine.

1051
01:43:17.246 --> 01:43:20.614
I can't believe they fell for the whole damn thing,
hook, line, and sinker.

1052
01:43:20.615 --> 01:43:23.687
- I know.
- Fucking idiots.

1053
01:43:31.967 --> 01:43:34.600
But if you were the last player,

1054
01:43:34.601 --> 01:43:37.833
who was supposed to be on the other side
of that plank with you?

1055
01:43:40.468 --> 01:43:41.672
There's the money.

1056
01:44:07.268 --> 01:44:08.996
Where's the fucking money?

1057
01:44:11.367 --> 01:44:12.967
Where's the money?

1058
01:44:42.904 --> 01:44:43.965
Fuck!

1059
01:44:48.709 --> 01:44:49.776
Fuck.

1060
01:45:39.292 --> 01:45:42.562
You are a warrior, my boy.

1061
01:45:43.194 --> 01:45:44.597
A warrior.

1062
01:45:45.527 --> 01:45:46.797
Are you okay?

1063
01:45:48.468 --> 01:45:50.900
Not exactly
as we planned it, but...

1064
01:45:52.974 --> 01:45:54.068
How did they know?

1065
01:45:57.112 --> 01:45:58.578
How did they know about you?

1066
01:46:00.015 --> 01:46:02.182
Parker Sears!

1067
01:46:02.183 --> 01:46:04.350
Okay? He was in on it!

1068
01:46:04.351 --> 01:46:06.949
He's a handler
and he's fucking Cecilia, too!

1069
01:46:10.593 --> 01:46:13.893
<i>I was able
to find the man you asked for.</i>

1070
01:46:13.894 --> 01:46:15.721
Uh-huh. Good.

1071
01:46:15.722 --> 01:46:17.824
<i>But Parker Sears?</i>

1072
01:46:17.825 --> 01:46:19.731
<i>You'll have to find
another way.</i>

1073
01:46:26.335 --> 01:46:27.541
Gotcha.

1074
01:46:28.308 --> 01:46:29.369
<i>We have a visitor.</i>

1075
01:46:45.391 --> 01:46:48.027
<i>Cecilia Pederson,</i>

1076
01:46:48.028 --> 01:46:50.328
<i>Parker Sears,</i>

1077
01:46:50.329 --> 01:46:53.263
<i>you've each been
working a grift.</i>

1078
01:46:53.264 --> 01:46:55.132
<i>Playing a role,</i>

1079
01:46:55.133 --> 01:46:56.995
<i>working together</i>

1080
01:46:56.996 --> 01:47:00.366
<i>continuing to play out
your scam.</i>

1081
01:47:00.367 --> 01:47:05.845
<i>Never realizing that you have been
the marks all night long.</i>

1082
01:47:12.751 --> 01:47:16.404
<i>You were given a chance
for redemption,</i>

1083
01:47:16.405 --> 01:47:20.059
<i>but at every turn,
you chose death,</i>

1084
01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:22.024
<i>instead of life.</i>

1085
01:47:23.927 --> 01:47:26.544
I promise you,
one way or another,

1086
01:47:26.545 --> 01:47:29.161
it's all gonna work out
according to plan.

1087
01:47:29.162 --> 01:47:31.764
<i>You have played
your last con game...</i>

1088
01:47:31.765 --> 01:47:34.367
- No!
<i>- ...but not your last game.</i>

1089
01:47:34.368 --> 01:47:39.514
<i>The two of you have worked together
to destroy others.</i>

1090
01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:47.813
<i>Now, you will work
against each other.</i>

1091
01:47:50.356 --> 01:47:53.187
<i>Only one can survive.</i>

1092
01:47:57.429 --> 01:47:59.831
<i>And the choice is yours.</i>

1093
01:48:13.708 --> 01:48:15.345
I thought you forgot about me.

1094
01:48:18.385 --> 01:48:20.016
You know I'd die for you, baby.

1095
01:48:39.007 --> 01:48:40.007
Ah!

1096
01:48:57.691 --> 01:49:00.091
You know she's eventually
gonna kill you, too, right?

1097
01:49:00.092 --> 01:49:02.492
- Fuck off, Amanda.
- She's gonna burn you.

1098
01:49:02.493 --> 01:49:04.258
You just can't see it yet.

1099
01:49:31.619 --> 01:49:32.957
John!

1100
01:49:37.328 --> 01:49:38.358
John!

1101
01:50:05.026 --> 01:50:06.221
<i>Gracias.</i>

1102
01:50:07.395 --> 01:50:08.861
Let's get you home, Carlos.

1103
01:52:36.773 --> 01:52:38.439
It's my war wound.

1104
01:52:40.449 --> 01:52:42.212
Where is your scar...

1105
01:52:43.316 --> 01:52:44.448
Henry?

1106
01:52:45.784 --> 01:52:47.118
Thank you, Detective,

1107
01:52:48.152 --> 01:52:50.891
for locating
my fellow cancer patient.

1108
01:52:59.829 --> 01:53:01.836
Out of all the men to cheat,

1109
01:53:03.339 --> 01:53:05.301
you picked John Kramer?

1110
01:53:06.274 --> 01:53:07.501
I mean...

1111
01:53:09.139 --> 01:53:12.772
I call that epic bad luck.

1112
01:53:12.773 --> 01:53:14.112
Please...

1113
01:53:14.844 --> 01:53:16.312
John, please.

1114
01:53:17.683 --> 01:53:19.083
Please, don't kill me.

1115
01:53:19.084 --> 01:53:22.087
That's the last thing that
you should be worried about.

1116
01:53:23.521 --> 01:53:24.892
Now...

1117
01:53:26.021 --> 01:53:28.262
I want to play a game.

1118
01:53:31.562 --> 01:53:33.497
No! No!

1119
01:53:36.237 --> 01:53:37.898
No! No!
