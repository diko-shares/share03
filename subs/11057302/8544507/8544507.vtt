1
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.120
You think we're in close?

2
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.380
They're almost impossible to find.
No one's ever captured one alive.

3
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.925
I agree to provide
security to you because I

4
00:01:22.937 --> 00:01:24.900
thought you were close
to fighting the spider.

5
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.963
A little bit worth the
wait. Dead specimens

6
00:01:28.975 --> 00:01:32.380
show that the peptides
in the spider's venom...

7
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.460
...basically they supercharge
their cellular structure.

8
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.660
That spider can give superhuman
strength and power like Asarana.

9
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.387
Asarana? The mythical spider
people who run across the

10
00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.660
treetops and punish evil men
with their black poison pests?

11
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.780
I'd like to make my research on
science, not legends, Mr. Stamps.

12
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.940
Those powers are wasted here.

13
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.660
These little spiders have the
potential to cure hundreds of diseases.

14
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.320
Are you okay?

15
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.880
No. She's trying her best
to keep me from working.

16
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.780
But I'm not gonna let her do that.

17
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.140
I don't wanna live close.

18
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.080
Perhaps you should rest.

19
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.360
I don't have time.

20
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.600
Thank you. For the umbrella.

21
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.500
No!

22
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.440
Isn't she beautiful? Incredible, isn't it?

23
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.260
Something so small, so much power.

24
00:03:24.261 --> 00:03:25.261
Stop!

25
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.740
What are you doing?
I don't... I don't understand.

26
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.260
I've been searching
for that spider for years.

27
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.220
No, we could help so many people.

28
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.060
I'm interested in helping people. No one
helped me when my family was starting.

29
00:03:43.715 --> 00:03:46.980
My road was not as clear as yours.
We didn't have the same choices.

30
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.556
You're making the wrong decision.

31
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.700
You're making the wrong decision.

32
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.360
Get it to me.

33
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.980
You can't walk away.

34
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.820
Stop! Stop! Stop!

35
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.700
Her journey will not be
easy, but she is strong.

36
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.680
She will come back when she
needs answers, and when she does,

37
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.280
I will be here for that.

38
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.650
This is 210 with a
42-year-old female, 12-3.

39
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.270
Guys, I've lost the pulse.
I'm starting compressions now.

40
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.250
Ben, what are you even doing back there?

41
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.370
Oh, you wanna come take over? I can drive.

42
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.190
I'm not going where this has gone my way.

43
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.049
I'm not going where this has gone my way.

44
00:06:35.441 --> 00:06:41.640
You're taking her back there.

45
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.680
Well, last time when the vehicle
drifted like this, I was getting shot at.

46
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.920
I wouldn't want you to be
home, except for the army.

47
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.320
I never thought I'd be this
happy to be back in Queens.

48
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.940
Wait, you better get shot at in Queens?

49
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.600
Shouldn't we go to school?

50
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.080
Who puts off it anyway? Jesus.

51
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.460
Jesus.

52
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.340
I'm gonna get roped in.

53
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.140
No, you're not. You're gonna be
in the backyard, growing with us.

54
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.520
I know how these things work, Ben.

55
00:07:26.521 --> 00:07:27.900
Oh, do you? How do you know?

56
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.656
I think you've never
been back to a lady job.

57
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.720
Yeah, I'm careful not to get roped in.

58
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.431
I'm glad I caught you
before you headed back out.

59
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:35.560
She's gonna be okay.

60
00:07:35.561 --> 00:07:37.760
There's loud room 124.

61
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:38.940
Who? You're patient.

62
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.020
Little boy wanted to say thank you.

63
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.640
You know what?
Mr. Ben Perker here did all the work, so...

64
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.720
Just take it.

65
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.340
Take it.

66
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.920
Take it.

67
00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.360
Thanks, buddy.

68
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.500
I'm taking a receiver.

69
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:03.350
Are you all immediately on me?

70
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:04.900
I'm her stepdaughter.

71
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.740
I think she might prefer...

72
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.250
Yeah, it's okay, Dad.

73
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.720
I'll see you guys back at your apartment.

74
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.140
Okay. Come on, buddy.

75
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.080
This is mine.

76
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:16.800
Okay.

77
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:18.480
This one is for you.

78
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.680
Thanks so much.

79
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.240
What am I supposed to do with this?

80
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.660
Just put it in your pocket and
then throw it away somewhere else.

81
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.310
You can't even fold it.
It's like cardboard.

82
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.020
Oh, come on.

83
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.220
We both hate family stuff.

84
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.140
I think I have plans, anyway, so...

85
00:08:44.141 --> 00:08:47.220
Plans? Since when you have plans,
you're, like, impossible to pin down.

86
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.600
Well, I like to keep my
options open, you know?

87
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.440
I might sleep in. I might go to the museum.

88
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.580
I might walk the dock.

89
00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:53.640
You don't have a dog?

90
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.880
I might adopt one.

91
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:56.380
Return the neighbor.

92
00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.700
I suspect you were a bit
more of an ample bucking.

93
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.560
I don't know what you're talking about.

94
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.160
I was a model foster kid.

95
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:04.840
A p-i and everything.

96
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.260
So, I, um...

97
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.380
kind of met someone.

98
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.160
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

99
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.760
What's this one saying?

100
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.500
Oh.

101
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.500
Serious.

102
00:09:24.524 --> 00:09:34.524
<b><font color=#60ff00>Subtitle made by Master_Blaster for https://subscene.com/</font></b>

103
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.240
Ooh!

104
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.380
Yeah!

105
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.190
She's a lucky lady, then.

106
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:05.290
Thank you.

107
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:06.570
Oh.

108
00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.210
You have a winning personality,
I guess I got yours by mistake.

109
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:13.230
You're an asshole.

110
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:14.550
Here.

111
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:17.690
Let's see what your future holds for you.

112
00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.300
What if I don't want to know?

113
00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:22.490
Well, it's just a cookie.

114
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.170
You will.

115
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:30.810
You will what?

116
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:33.790
Apparently I have no future.

117
00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.330
Cassie, do you know what this means?

118
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:37.530
What?

119
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.110
It means that their printer is broken.

120
00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:42.370
We can't eat here anymore.

121
00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:01.810
I just need to make up this pizza.

122
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.156
Why don't you come in and talk to me, Dad?

123
00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.380
I haven't seen you in a while.

124
00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.780
This is not home right now, actually.

125
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.660
I'm coming back to work.

126
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:12.340
I swear.

127
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.540
Why? All right.

128
00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.620
Us strange things stick together.

129
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.260
Somebody's hungry.

130
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:20.500
I hope the spiders weren't worth it, Mom.

131
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.690
We ate three people, four people.

132
00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:37.450
What now, Mom?

133
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:38.870
What now?

134
00:13:38.871 --> 00:13:40.270
What now?

135
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.980
Three, two, one.

136
00:13:44.981 --> 00:13:49.800
Can you tell me
your name? Robert.

137
00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:51.960
Robert? I'm Cassie.

138
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.840
What?

139
00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.220
I'm gonna help you out, okay?

140
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.880
You're gonna be all right.

141
00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.240
All right, I'm gonna cut your seatbelt,
and when I do, you're gonna fall,

142
00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.560
and my partner's gonna help
you out on that side, okay?

143
00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.280
Three, two, one.

144
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:05.880
All right, Robert.

145
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.000
One, two, three.

146
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.020
Why? Aywork.

147
00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:49.580
You're going to tell me your name.

148
00:14:49.581 --> 00:14:50.581
Mm-hmm.

149
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.960
Do you guys need ice cold?

150
00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.880
I'm gonna take the ice cold.

151
00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.100
Eee-huh.

152
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:00.700
No need to press.

153
00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.840
No need to press.

154
00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.280
No need to press.

155
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.700
You can't say your name right now.

156
00:15:07.701 --> 00:15:08.360
Yes, I can't, I can't say
your name right now.

157
00:15:08.361 --> 00:15:08.680
I'm gonna take the ice cold.

158
00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.728
to be in more than one
place at the same time as

159
00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.560
you are the only one
who can change the future.

160
00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:16.420
NOOOOOOO!

161
00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.120
It's a crazy dream!

162
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.560
Come on! I'm tired.

163
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.760
I'm nervous.

164
00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.360
Did I die?

165
00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.940
Yeah, you were down three
minutes before I fished you out.

166
00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:31.460
Three minutes? Yeah.

167
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.400
Welcome back to the land of the living.

168
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:53.370
79 over 55, you need a real workout
at a real hospital with a real doctor.

169
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:54.630
I don't need a doctor.

170
00:15:55.635 --> 00:15:56.635
I trust you.

171
00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:59.130
80%! That's great.

172
00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:01.770
Why are we above
that of a dead fish?

173
00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:04.450
Huh?

174
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.450
No, 2's going up to 89.

175
00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:11.170
Come back in the water any time.

176
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:24.830
79 over 55, you need a real workout
at a real hospital with a real doctor.

177
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.590
Seriously, Ben, dial it back. I'm fine.

178
00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.200
Wait, wait, wait.
I need to get your oxygen onwards.

179
00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:33.310
Again?

180
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:35.290
What are you talking
about? My O2 is 89.

181
00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:36.550
No, it's not.

182
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:41.170
..

183
00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:43.210
Oh, you're right.

184
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.930
Are you okay? What the
hell happened out there? Fine.

185
00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.690
I just want to go home and watch Idol.

186
00:17:53.500 --> 00:18:02.620
No, no, no, no.

187
00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:51.090
Where's my spider?

188
00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:52.610
Where's my spider?

189
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:49.150
It's not a dream.

190
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.850
I'm going to be murdered one day.

191
00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:54.910
Oh, wow, that's a buzzkill.

192
00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.330
The same three faces.

193
00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.530
Every night, the same vision.

194
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:06.550
It's a curse.

195
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:08.630
But we all die someday.

196
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:10.930
I think we really didn't stop that.

197
00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:16.390
If you still always go on to
murder you, you try to stop them.

198
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:18.930
Okay.

199
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:26.050
You have no idea of the torment and
torture of dying over and over again.

200
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:27.530
And I can't escape it.

201
00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.660
So I'm not going to sit
back and let it happen.

202
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:36.370
I will find them and kill them first.

203
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:43.450
So you know who did... I mean, will do it?

204
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:47.370
It's always those three faces.

205
00:20:47.371 --> 00:20:51.684
Can you imagine how
frustrating it's been trying

206
00:20:51.696 --> 00:20:55.930
to identify someone
I've only seen in a vision?

207
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.270
But as the universe has, there
have been technological advances.

208
00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:07.090
New ways to find people
if you know their faces.

209
00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:14.210
The kind of technology I've heard the
National Security Agency has been pursuing.

210
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:33.400
What are you doing?

211
00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.140
How are you questioning me?

212
00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:36.820
What's your password, ma'am?

213
00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.060
I can't tell you.

214
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.220
Please! Yes, please,
your password.

215
00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:48.140
Tell me quickly before the paralysis
reaches your lips, and I'll stop the poison.

216
00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:05.960
Q-9-2-0-B-3-7-5

217
00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:21.370
It's a good thing I had no idea today
was the day we were going to die.

218
00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:43.490
Hey!

219
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:48.570
Hey, next time you want to go swimming,
maybe you should stick to a story apart.

220
00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:50.890
Oh, that's really funny.
You're such a funny guy.

221
00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:52.890
Are you crafting the burgers?

222
00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:54.550
I'm releasing them back.

223
00:22:55.135 --> 00:22:57.735
That's called play here, ma'am.
Plus, it's like really clam-able.

224
00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:58.430
There you go.

225
00:22:58.670 --> 00:22:59.670
Oh, thanks.

226
00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.050
You don't think that maybe in light
of recent events I could use a beer?

227
00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:08.910
Well, as you know, the protocol is no
booze within 24 hours of your death.

228
00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:10.410
Is that protocol?

229
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:11.770
Yeah, it's a protocol.

230
00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:12.750
That's boring.

231
00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:14.790
I feel like there's more of a story there.

232
00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:18.490
No, you guys, we've seen this a
hundred times. It was cardiac arrest.

233
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.010
When your heart starts
back up again, you're fine.

234
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:23.190
Really?

235
00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.270
Yeah, huh?
Did you see the white light or what?

236
00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:34.710
Well, actually, I saw Jersey, so you
tell me... Oh, come on. You saw Jersey.

237
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.430
Hey.

238
00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:36.730
What did Jersey do?

239
00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:38.890
They were rushing the burgers.

240
00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:40.310
Yeah, they're ruined now.

241
00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:41.810
You saw them?

242
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.680
Oh, now they're really ruined.

243
00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:45.570
Ready to start.

244
00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:46.610
What?

245
00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:47.390
What?

246
00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:49.410
They're starting to
see if you get in there.

247
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:51.690
No, you were right. They're roping in.

248
00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:52.650
Yeah, thank you so much.

249
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:53.870
You're welcome.

250
00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:55.010
Have fun.

251
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:02.750
This is for you.

252
00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:03.850
This is for you.

253
00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:10.650
Hi, I'm Cassie Webb. Thanks for having me.

254
00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.070
You're Ben's partner.
I'm his sister-in-law.

255
00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:13.630
Yeah.

256
00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:15.190
Nice to meet you.

257
00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.650
Ben is so excited about being an uncle.

258
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:19.956
I don't know what we'd do without him.

259
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.140
Especially with Richard away.

260
00:24:21.475 --> 00:24:23.410
Again, where is it this time?

261
00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:27.410
He's in Mumbai, Shanghai.
I can't keep track.

262
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:34.370
Never stops leaping around
in there and always hungry.

263
00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.750
Does it have a name?

264
00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.320
We're saving that for the games.

265
00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:56.120
My mother always cut the
crusts off my sandwiches.

266
00:24:58.660 --> 00:24:59.180
Chloe, is that you?

267
00:24:59.181 --> 00:25:00.181
Yes.

268
00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.120
My mom said the crust
would make my hair feel curly.

269
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.470
It was yours before I figured that one out.

270
00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:14.110
This is this.

271
00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:17.570
Oh, it's mine.

272
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:20.970
You must have at least one
thought memory of your mother.

273
00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:25.110
Well, my mother
actually died in childbirth.

274
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:28.510
But it wasn't that bad.

275
00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:32.710
Obviously, it was that. She died.

276
00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:37.850
But I grew up totally healthy.

277
00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:40.710
Death in childbirth is super rare.

278
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.730
She chose to be way deeper than
Amazon for the last month of her pregnancy,

279
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:49.720
hundreds of miles away
from any medical facilities.

280
00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:53.570
Okay, so let's move on to the next one.

281
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.110
Guess the name of Mary's baby.

282
00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:00.890
Okay, I'll kick things off.

283
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:04.110
Stephen.

284
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:06.970
He's not named Stephen.

285
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:08.950
You guys are ice cold.

286
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:16.510
Richard Jr.

287
00:26:16.511 --> 00:26:17.511
? Richard wishes.

288
00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:22.190
Cassie, what's your guess?

289
00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.030
Wait, we just did this.

290
00:26:46.031 --> 00:26:49.770
What's your guess?

291
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.570
Wait, we just did this.

292
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:02.090
What, seriously, is this part of the game?

293
00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:07.210
Sorry, they're calling everyone
in and fighting down into dogs.

294
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:11.310
So...

295
00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:12.530
You okay?

296
00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:16.110
Yeah, I just got a weird sense of deja vu.

297
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.870
Looks like a practically
left radius under my stable.

298
00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.480
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

299
00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.600
Check this out.

300
00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.460
Oh, it's okay.

301
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.040
We had the internal injuries.

302
00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:44.380
Good catch.

303
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.220
Hey, I need to get my gun out of there.

304
00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.920
Stay where people are trapped.

305
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.000
We need to treat them before we move them.

306
00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.640
He's packed with explosives.

307
00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:00.580
Engestion will bring fireworks.

308
00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:02.760
Ignore them!

309
00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:07.260
Ignore them!

310
00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.380
Cassie!

311
00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.720
Cassie!

312
00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.420
This place is always
going to be a dead trap.

313
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.560
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

314
00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:24.740
Check this out.

315
00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.240
Cassie! Cassie! Cassie!

316
00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.440
I need you at the triad!

317
00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.260
Sir, you're okay. You're okay.

318
00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.100
He's stable, ready to transport.

319
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:54.880
Is everything okay?

320
00:28:54.881 --> 00:28:56.560
What's up?

321
00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.080
Wait!

322
00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:59.260
I'm out!

323
00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.100
Hey, what is it? I got a roll.

324
00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.360
We let you drive?

325
00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:03.840
What are you talking about?

326
00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.740
I don't know, I just...
I don't know what we're feeling.

327
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.380
Cassie, I need you over there.

328
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.200
Will you just let me drive?

329
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.660
We've got a bad experience on the job.

330
00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:15.460
I don't think that's what's happening.

331
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.900
Don't let it mess with your head.

332
00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:48.130
We don't need you.

333
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:56.310
We don't need you.

334
00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:07.940
Cassie! Cassie!

335
00:30:07.941 --> 00:30:11.300
Hey, Cassie!

336
00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:13.780
Cassie, come on!

337
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.980
Cassie! Cassie!

338
00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.300
Come on, come on!

339
00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.300
Come on, Cassie!

340
00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:27.600
You've got to help me!

341
00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.440
It's okay, okay?

342
00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.740
Just have a little time, okay?

343
00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:14.460
So, was it worth the trouble?

344
00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.220
The scale of the NSA's
surveillance is unprecedented.

345
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.080
They can access everything.

346
00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.060
There's... there's nowhere to hide.

347
00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.120
That's the idea.

348
00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:25.420
The potential is infinite.

349
00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:28.420
It's... it's intoxicating, but...

350
00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.420
in the wrong hands, I mean...

351
00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.880
people can be tracked wherever they go.

352
00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.360
It's going to change everything.

353
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.420
As long as it has the ability
to find those women now,

354
00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:41.120
before they get their powers.

355
00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:43.460
This is what they look
like in your visions,

356
00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:44.780
as well as you can recollect.

357
00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:47.920
Their faces have been
daunting me for years.

358
00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.460
We don't know exactly
when your vision takes place,

359
00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.820
so I'm giving this a 10-year
range just to be safe.

360
00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.160
Here's what they should look like now.

361
00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:06.560
If you're good, then I thought I'd... I
didn't know we'd be targeting teenagers.

362
00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.120
They're teenagers now, but in the future,

363
00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.120
they have powers, and
they will try to destroy me.

364
00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.340
I came from nothing, less than nothing.

365
00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:17.000
I will not give up everything I've built,

366
00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.480
and have my life cut short.

367
00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:26.300
I'll say, ride public transportation, go to
the museum, get money from an ATM,

368
00:32:27.365 --> 00:32:28.605
wherever they are in the world.

369
00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.040
Fine, then.

370
00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:32.660
I'd pay you a fortune.

371
00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:34.620
Yeah, fine.

372
00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.400
Still no blurriness, no division,

373
00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.460
no discoloration at all.

374
00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:45.240
Your eyesight is good,

375
00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.100
and all your other vitals check out.

376
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.580
But what about the visions?

377
00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.580
How long have I seen that stuff?

378
00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:56.340
Sometimes, when we experience trauma,

379
00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:57.820
it can have a lasting effect.

380
00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.120
This isn't trauma.

381
00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:01.220
I knew he was gonna die.

382
00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.680
I saw it.

383
00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.981
Cassie, I have all your reports
here from your other consultations.

384
00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:10.380
Your head CT was
normal, your MRI was clear.

385
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.500
The scan showed no abnormality.

386
00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.860
I know that it sounds crazy.

387
00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:16.040
I know, but I don't
understand what's happening.

388
00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.400
I will be recommending
that you take a week off.

389
00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.640
Get some rest.

390
00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:20.700
Watch old movies.

391
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.660
If you still have concerns,

392
00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.680
I can run some bloods over for you to take.

393
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:28.700
But I'm sure everything will be
back to normal before you know it.

394
00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:33.300
I have been to prison service.

395
00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:34.740
Prison's yet to come.

396
00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.721
If you have a feeling you
won't let anyone take that.

397
00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:51.110
I can never see anyone.

398
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:58.791
Hey Cassie, it's me again.

399
00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:00.510
Ben.

400
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:02.230
You're there to speak up.

401
00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:06.190
Okay, well, uh...

402
00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:07.930
O'Neill's funeral starts at two.

403
00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:09.691
I can see everyone's gone.

404
00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:12.790
I know, it's the last place you want to be.

405
00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.730
But it would help Susan.

406
00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.230
The king might help you too.

407
00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.681
But if you leave now,
you can still be good.

408
00:34:21.410 --> 00:34:22.410
Cassie?

409
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:23.830
Cass?

410
00:34:23.831 --> 00:34:24.831
Yes.

411
00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:43.070
Ain't afraid to be screwed, but...

412
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:45.730
you can't change anything.

413
00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:36.820
This isn't going to change anything.

414
00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:01.970
It's the entire world.

415
00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:58.660
I'm going to the cancer, please.

416
00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:07.780
On your course, I start
moving onto the platform.

417
00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:10.500
She's on her own.

418
00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:15.300
Julia Cornwall is on the
concourse, also alone.

419
00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:20.100
And Martha Franklin.

420
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Shit!

421
00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.980
What are the odds of them all being
in the same place at the same time?

422
00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:28.140
It's not a coincidence.

423
00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:30.820
There must be something that connects them.

424
00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.420
Or... something that will.

425
00:37:34.421 --> 00:37:37.760
Please keep all coming to you at all times.

426
00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.660
Please do see something suspicious
by the member of the MTA staff.

427
00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:09.120
You don't see the whole
new level of craziness.

428
00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.960
Fire!

429
00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:32.540
This is the train to Mount Parker.

430
00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:50.720
Is this real?

431
00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:53.260
Are you okay too?

432
00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.700
Oh god, I'm in the park.

433
00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:59.400
You don't see the whole new
level of craziness these days.

434
00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.480
This is the train to Mount Parker.

435
00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:41.300
This is the train to Mount Parker.

436
00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.060
Get up. Get up. Get up.

437
00:40:54.061 --> 00:40:54.440
Get up.

438
00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:55.000
Beep.

439
00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:55.880
Get up.

440
00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:57.380
You're gonna die if you stay here.

441
00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:57.600
Get up.

442
00:40:57.601 --> 00:40:59.100
What? Are you where it is?

443
00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.700
This is an emergency situation.
I need you to follow my instructions.

444
00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:03.960
Get off the train.

445
00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:04.440
Come on.

446
00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:05.400
I'll just let you know.

447
00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:06.040
I'll just let you know.

448
00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.000
Get up.

449
00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:08.340
Hey, give me that back.

450
00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:15.080
I'm so pressing charges.

451
00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.020
Okay, knock yourself out.

452
00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.120
Give me my person to stay for that.

453
00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.040
What's up? Okay, come on.

454
00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:45.880
I'm getting my freaking skateboard back.

455
00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:46.280
Okay.

456
00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.140
What exactly is this emergency?

457
00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:48.720
What?

458
00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:50.080
Someone's trying to deduct us.

459
00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:51.100
What? No.

460
00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.480
Shit.

461
00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:56.380
Back to your emergency.

462
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:17.670
Yeah!

463
00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:52.850
The FDC is placing the luggage rack above.

464
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:22.790
Hey.

465
00:43:22.791 --> 00:43:23.791
Holy shit.

466
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:24.910
Come on.

467
00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:46.370
No.

468
00:43:46.371 --> 00:43:47.451
There's an emergency, guys.

469
00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:51.740
What's going on
here? I don't know.

470
00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:52.960
We'll have you some coffee.

471
00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.236
You guys need to call from back.

472
00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:55.060
That will not be necessary.

473
00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:55.860
I told you to call.

474
00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:56.740
Hey, let's go.

475
00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:57.640
Don't leave us.

476
00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:58.040
Shit.

477
00:43:59.040 --> 00:43:59.700
We'll be in the car.

478
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:00.640
We'll be in the car.

479
00:44:00.641 --> 00:44:01.641
Go.

480
00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:05.450
Go.

481
00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:12.570
Go, go, go.

482
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:13.890
Go, go, go, go.

483
00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:35.860
Shit.

484
00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:43.930
Shit.

485
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.110
Get in.

486
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:50.800
Get in.

487
00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:56.400
It's not even possible.

488
00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:57.200
It's not.

489
00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.336
There's not enough friction on
course and the bear came and

490
00:44:59.348 --> 00:45:01.336
flipped to overcome gravity
and keep him stuck to the wall.

491
00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:02.200
It's not like sailing.

492
00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:33.830
What is it?

493
00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:37.010
I'm Anya Corazón.

494
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:39.030
Madi Franklin.

495
00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:40.590
Thank you for protecting us.

496
00:45:40.591 --> 00:45:43.370
No, no, no.
That's not what's happening here.

497
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:45.830
I'm not protecting you. I am...

498
00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:48.850
Your parents can handle this.

499
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:50.366
Your parents are on a business trip.

500
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:51.970
Yeah, my parents are out of town, too.

501
00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:54.370
Oh, my daughter's busy working, so...

502
00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:56.046
Oh, it's going to go
stay with some friends.

503
00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:58.430
Well, where are your friends live?
I'll drop you off first.

504
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:06.230
That's great. Good.

505
00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:08.610
Hope they find you crazy ass.

506
00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:12.230
That was insane. They better lock them up.

507
00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:17.010
She?

508
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:22.570
What? What? That's.

509
00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:25.810
..

510
00:46:25.811 --> 00:46:27.710
Look, you guys...
What about them?

511
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:29.150
He was crawling on the ceiling.

512
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.970
What about that guy?

513
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:31.150
I mean, you saw...

514
00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:32.530
No one saw a ceiling guy.

515
00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:34.070
Everyone thinks Julie could not hurt.

516
00:46:34.071 --> 00:46:35.850
Yeah, because you told them I was.

517
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:37.230
I didn't know what was happening.

518
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:38.470
Okay, guys.

519
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:41.206
My Uncle John can totally help us.
I'm going to call him.

520
00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:42.230
You're moving phone?

521
00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:44.170
You know they can track
those nowadays, right?

522
00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:47.210
Hey, you can't do that.

523
00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:47.810
She's right.

524
00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:49.446
It's okay. Daddy, I thought you knew it.

525
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:50.470
What is your problem?

526
00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:51.230
What are you doing?

527
00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:52.370
I'm just trying to help.

528
00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:55.790
Okay, anyone who wants
to leave can leave right now.

529
00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:56.970
Okay.

530
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:58.290
Wait.

531
00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:03.970
Sorry, no, you can't actually
leave because you guys

532
00:47:03.971 --> 00:47:04.971
are the only ones that know
what actually happened.

533
00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:11.020
Okay, well, this is what
we're going to do, okay?

534
00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:13.360
We're just going to,
like, lay low for a little bit.

535
00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:18.081
And, um... I'll figure
out how to get out of this.

536
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:27.070
This is still not a kidnapping, okay?

537
00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:29.930
Feels like a kidnapping.

538
00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.120
How did they get away?

539
00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:36.100
It's like the rumor was coming.

540
00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:40.360
No, it's the transportation in
West Duval or any of the bridges.

541
00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:43.100
Okay, there weren't there any cameras.

542
00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.800
The police don't have this technology.

543
00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:47.560
You have access to
every camera in the city.

544
00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:49.740
We should be ahead of them.

545
00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:52.780
I went to a lot of trouble
to steal you these tools.

546
00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:54.460
You stole them back.

547
00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:57.240
Have I just wanted to be a fresco?

548
00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:58.780
Of course you did.

549
00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:00.740
And maybe I'll start it.

550
00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:02.640
All I have is gum.

551
00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:06.560
Here, I found this in
the glove compartment.

552
00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.536
Wait, not that. I've already been open.

553
00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:11.036
We don't know how long it's been in there.

554
00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:13.560
Okay, I hope you're good
at, um, catching squirrels.

555
00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:17.300
Okay, so, what's the
deal with stealing guys?

556
00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:18.720
I told you, I don't know.

557
00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:20.340
I've never seen him before.

558
00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.020
How did you know he was coming?

559
00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:25.360
I'm kind of more interested
in why he's trying to kill us.

560
00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:27.120
I don't know.

561
00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:30.240
Crazy shit's been happening
and I don't know why.

562
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:31.920
Stop asking me, okay?

563
00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:34.160
Wait, you're the paramedic.

564
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:39.220
You saved my stepmother then
you were super awkward about it.

565
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:43.400
That does sound like me.

566
00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:45.520
Wait, I recognize you too.

567
00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:47.100
What?

568
00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:48.740
Yeah, you live in my building.

569
00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:52.306
You leave your junk
mail in the lobby and then

570
00:48:52.318 --> 00:48:54.280
everybody else has
to clean it up for you.

571
00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:56.720
Okay, well, there should
be a recycling bin there.

572
00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.320
You don't think this is weird?

573
00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:00.780
That we both know you?

574
00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:04.160
It's honestly, like, the least
weird thing that's happened all day.

575
00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:08.650
What? Total stranger.

576
00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:14.410
No.

577
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:16.910
You flipped me off.

578
00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:19.030
It's not really really down much.

579
00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:20.290
Here, this is so freaky.

580
00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:22.930
Who are you? What is going on?

581
00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.950
I can see the future.

582
00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:29.970
Kind of.

583
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:37.910
I didn't.

584
00:49:37.911 --> 00:49:39.830
Oh, what the hell? See?

585
00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:41.530
You shouldn't see that coming.

586
00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:43.550
It doesn't work like that.

587
00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:45.510
You guys, just give her a chance, please.

588
00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:48.933
Wait, when you were
looking into the future,

589
00:49:48.945 --> 00:49:51.250
did you see us in the
middle of nowhere,

590
00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:55.550
eating love compartment or... Okay,
look, believe me or don't, I don't care.

591
00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:58.084
I didn't ask to be
doing this with you and I

592
00:49:58.096 --> 00:50:00.350
didn't ask for this to
happen to me either.

593
00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:03.650
Also, I'm pretty sure I've
saved all of your lives.

594
00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:06.050
So, you're welcome.

595
00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:09.940
How does it work?

596
00:50:12.490 --> 00:50:13.490
It just happens.

597
00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:15.130
Can you do it now?

598
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:18.190
I can't control it.

599
00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:21.190
You know the other guy can walk
on the ceiling, right? No, he can't.

600
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:25.630
He was using his hands.

601
00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:27.670
Why are you like this?

602
00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:30.190
I'm just saying it was more of a crawl.

603
00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:34.130
It was like a spider... person.

604
00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.960
I'm gonna be back in a few hours.

605
00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:48.900
Where are you going?

606
00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:52.500
I need to check some
things out about all of this.

607
00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:54.960
You can't just leave us here.

608
00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.360
We'll be okay, Julia, we
don't need a babysitter.

609
00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:59.640
Oh, yeah, sure, just three
teenagers alone in the

610
00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:01.440
woods, definitely not
the opening of a war film.

611
00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.280
You are way safer out here.

612
00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:08.260
Just, you know, be like a Girl Scout girl.

613
00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:10.360
Be back. Just be back.

614
00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:11.861
Can you bring us some
sandwiches? Pass the ear.

615
00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:17.260
Can we toast here?

616
00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.580
Three hours, okay?
Just stay here.

617
00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:23.720
Don't do anything dumb.

618
00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:31.540
Seriously, don't do dumb things.

619
00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:36.020
She was stalking you.

620
00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:39.280
Okay, well, you're just a bitch, so...

621
00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.760
I know a second ago.

622
00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:48.580
You.

623
00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:52.801
I had a few rough years in school
when my parents were divorced,

624
00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:56.240
so I wanted to feel like
I'd be back if I needed to.

625
00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:02.740
That's what I thought.

626
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:16.430
One second, Kat.

627
00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:26.920
Research on Amazonian spiders.

628
00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:29.780
Peptides.

629
00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.120
More peptides.

630
00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:32.720
Where is it?

631
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:36.000
Ah, spider people.

632
00:53:37.575 --> 00:53:38.575
Las Aranyas.

633
00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:41.641
Have you ever heard
of Las Aranyas? Neither.

634
00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:49.080
According to local folklore,

635
00:53:50.735 --> 00:53:53.740
they possess powers
derived from spider venom

636
00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:57.920
and are incredibly fast, incredibly strong,

637
00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:00.330
and...

638
00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:01.840
they can climb like spiders.

639
00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:05.540
She's like a singing guy.

640
00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:17.040
How would you know if you could
climb a wall if you've ever tried?

641
00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:36.550
Okay, let's not mention that as anybody.

642
00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:48.020
Las Aranyas are said
to possess a sixth sense

643
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:51.140
as if they have the
ability to climb the future.

644
00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:26.010
Who's got the
jerky? You ate it all.

645
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:29.020
You had like three pieces.

646
00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:30.260
I was fine.

647
00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:31.640
You counted.

648
00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:32.880
You also ate all mine.

649
00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:36.240
What's this? Okay.

650
00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:43.070
We got jerky.

651
00:55:44.490 --> 00:55:45.610
Did you guys see that diner?

652
00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:47.371
Like a half mile down the road?

653
00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:49.186
Let's just go there and get real food.

654
00:55:49.210 --> 00:55:50.450
How's it supposed to
stay here? Come on, Julia.

655
00:55:51.730 --> 00:55:52.730
She bailed on us.

656
00:55:53.110 --> 00:55:54.570
We don't have any money, Junius.

657
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:55.950
Well, I have money.

658
00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:59.301
You have money so we
should do what you want?

659
00:55:59.710 --> 00:56:00.710
You got something to say?

660
00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:02.550
You know, I bet.

661
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:04.030
Your dad is a senator,

662
00:56:04.355 --> 00:56:05.966
and your mom sits on the board at the Met,

663
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:08.271
and you somewhere in the
Hamptons next to Martha Stewart.

664
00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:09.610
So sad about Martha Stewart.

665
00:56:13.405 --> 00:56:14.530
My parents are in Beijing,

666
00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:17.986
where my dad is raking in a tunnel and you're
making plastics that pollute the ocean,

667
00:56:18.010 --> 00:56:19.810
and my mom is spending
it all on hideous art.

668
00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:22.901
So I talked to them on Mondays.

669
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:24.230
So who do you live with?

670
00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:25.990
The housekeeper.

671
00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:29.370
Well, on the upside note, curfew.

672
00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:32.301
I bet you have your own room at least.

673
00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:36.030
I live with my dad and
his wife and their kid.

674
00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:37.730
What about your mom?

675
00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:40.650
She's not really around.

676
00:56:41.370 --> 00:56:42.370
She got money? Right, so.

677
00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:45.290
..

678
00:56:45.291 --> 00:56:46.291
Diner?

679
00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:49.011
Please spend some money
saying it's pollution money.

680
00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:51.691
I'm going to order
everything I'm going to need.

681
00:56:54.450 --> 00:56:55.450
Julia, you in?

682
00:56:57.210 --> 00:56:58.210
Hey.

683
00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:00.201
We have to take care of ourselves.

684
00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:08.480
Yeah.

685
00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:12.060
You're right.

686
00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:14.810
Let's go do this.

687
00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:18.300
She's kind of cute when she's mad.

688
00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:23.200
We weren't making
the right decision, Julia.

689
00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:25.060
We would not like women of hatred.

690
00:57:26.010 --> 00:57:27.160
Who decides we like you now?

691
00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:28.840
Why?

692
00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:30.760
I knew we should have done this.

693
00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:37.220
Do you think there's ticks?

694
00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:41.220
Julia walks a little bit faster.

695
00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:43.471
You said this was a shortcut.

696
00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:44.760
Are you lost?

697
00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:46.400
I don't know where you're going.

698
00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:47.580
You're no where you're at.

699
00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:48.660
Actually, I do.

700
00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:51.860
Ow!

701
00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:58.500
Okay, don't talk to anybody except a woman.

702
00:57:59.100 --> 00:57:59.880
We're going to be nowhere.

703
00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:01.340
Don't try to track us down here.

704
00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:02.980
Don't make eye contact.

705
00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:04.721
Oh, I don't have a chance.

706
00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:10.020
She'll walk a little bit
faster than the other woman.

707
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:17.150
So there you go.

708
00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:30.160
Should we begin?

709
00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:31.480
Eat fruits?

710
00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:32.700
Start a choice later.

711
00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:34.900
Tell me.

712
00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:44.440
Let's just eat quickly
and then get up here.

713
00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:47.620
Absolutely bread and
dough, right after cherry pie.

714
00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.120
Yeah, I know.

715
00:58:49.690 --> 00:58:50.840
No cherry pie.

716
00:58:53.550 --> 00:58:55.631
Julia, tell me you agree
that we should get dessert.

717
00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:01.520
Yeah, whatever you guys are under
another sugar, I'll pay for the good price.

718
00:59:11.290 --> 00:59:13.040
We should go ahead and talk to them.

719
00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:14.580
Really?

720
00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:16.620
No, we should be kidding.

721
00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:17.760
Should we? Maybe we can't.

722
00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:20.680
Yeah, you want to.

723
00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:21.980
I know.

724
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.160
This is a good idea.

725
00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:24.840
It's a good idea.

726
00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:25.840
Yeah, what are you doing?

727
00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:27.060
Hold on a second.

728
00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:28.180
Where's this?

729
00:59:32.135 --> 00:59:34.000
This isn't really my style.

730
00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:36.200
Come on.

731
00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:37.000
You're cute.

732
00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:38.740
This is not a good idea.

733
00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:40.240
Jason, guys.

734
00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:41.800
Hi.

735
00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:43.120
Hey, how are you doing?

736
00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:44.500
How are you doing? Thanks a lot.

737
00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:46.660
Yeah, I'm doing great.

738
00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:47.360
Thanks a lot.

739
00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:48.840
Thank you.

740
00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:50.500
Okay.

741
00:59:58.650 --> 01:00:00.290
Patch Hill City in Churchill, New Jersey.

742
01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:02.410
Connect me with Churchill Police Dispatch.

743
01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:03.350
Yeah.

744
01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:04.830
Patch, are you in now?

745
01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.360
Two-two-three dispatch.

746
01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:16.580
On scene of four-star-niner.

747
01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.540
Route 206 of Dave's Road.

748
01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:19.620
You're in two-two-three.

749
01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:21.020
No need to send back.

750
01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.940
These aren't our missing persons.

751
01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:27.860
Go forward.

752
01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.620
These are not our missing persons.

753
01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.640
No.

754
01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:41.780
Girls?

755
01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:17.060
Girls?

756
01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:34.280
So much more attractive attention.

757
01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.800
I won't even know that.

758
01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:53.640
We have to get off this.

759
01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:57.720
I'm so sorry.

760
01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:01.780
Get down.

761
01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:04.460
This isn't what we were thinking.

762
01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:04.760
Stop.

763
01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:05.940
You'll laugh at us.

764
01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:08.040
I'm so sorry.

765
01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:13.180
Julia!

766
01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:15.360
Julia, get back!

767
01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.160
Julia, get back!

768
01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:19.380
Stop!

769
01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:20.640
Stop!

770
01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:27.440
Come on!

771
01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:28.660
No!

772
01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:29.820
No!

773
01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:32.140
No!

774
01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:36.550
No!

775
01:02:36.810 --> 01:02:36.830
No!

776
01:02:36.831 --> 01:02:37.831
No!

777
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:39.910
Come on!

778
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:43.950
No!

779
01:02:45.010 --> 01:02:46.010
No!

780
01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:49.530
No!

781
01:03:17.315 --> 01:03:18.756
This track is going to be confusing.

782
01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:19.920
Have you heard the song?

783
01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.040
This is with you, bitch.

784
01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.480
Let's try that again.

785
01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.580
I love this song.

786
01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:42.860
Nice.

787
01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:44.620
Okay, okay, sorry.

788
01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:51.880
This is funny.

789
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Try it.

790
01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:55.140
Okay.

791
01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:21.340
Come on.

792
01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:21.960
Let's go.

793
01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:23.640
We were pretending to hold a brick.

794
01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.260
I know you were working hard.

795
01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:26.420
Get up here.

796
01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.320
Come on.

797
01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:46.640
Come on.

798
01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:54.960
Leave everything.

799
01:05:00.250 --> 01:05:04.230
I'm so sorry.

800
01:05:19.050 --> 01:05:20.050
No.

801
01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:28.380
So much for not meeting a bathing spot.

802
01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:30.280
You guys think of anybody but yourselves.

803
01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:33.060
You're so impulsive and entitled.

804
01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:33.940
And you don't listen.

805
01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:34.680
We didn't even see.

806
01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:36.460
Whatever, don't even say anything.

807
01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:42.000
God, you're futures
were almost so different.

808
01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:45.560
You're lucky I saw them.

809
01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:46.640
I'm so sorry.

810
01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:48.060
Yes!

811
01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:51.640
You should be so sorry.
All of you should be sorry.

812
01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:20.800
I'm sorry.

813
01:06:20.801 --> 01:06:21.801
I'm running checks now.

814
01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:24.980
I don't understand how they're doing this.

815
01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:26.940
I've got a mountain
over and he's with them.

816
01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:28.320
I'm not interested in her.

817
01:06:28.321 --> 01:06:30.660
It's about the zone finding those girls.

818
01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:34.720
Cassandra Webb, daughter
of Constance Webb deceased.

819
01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:36.560
Did you say Webb? Uh, yeah.

820
01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:39.220
Do you know her?

821
01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:40.660
It's not possible.

822
01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:44.360
Mom!

823
01:06:48.810 --> 01:06:50.731
He's not gonna stop.
Please, he'll just be busy.

824
01:06:52.030 --> 01:06:53.250
I don't know what he wants.

825
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:54.950
I don't know what I need to say.

826
01:06:56.830 --> 01:06:58.470
But you can see the future.

827
01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:01.410
Can't you stop him with your visions?

828
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:03.810
I don't know how to control them.

829
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:05.910
It's useless.

830
01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:07.730
I don't know why, maybe that's a plus.

831
01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:09.290
Is your hand okay? It's fine.

832
01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.961
First thing in the morning
I'm taking you all home.

833
01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.720
My parents can deal with this.

834
01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:23.240
No, they can't.

835
01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:28.160
My mom's in a psych ward.

836
01:07:30.690 --> 01:07:32.366
She didn't really cope
well after my dad left,

837
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:35.000
and so I got sent to live
with him and his new family,

838
01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.840
and I don't think that they want me there.

839
01:07:40.310 --> 01:07:41.900
I wondered if they missed me if...

840
01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:44.480
if I ran away.

841
01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:47.100
Hmm. That's what you did.

842
01:07:48.290 --> 01:07:49.571
My parents aren't around either.

843
01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.641
I think they resent how having
a kid messed up their lives.

844
01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:55.866
I don't think they're gonna fly
back from China to deal with this,

845
01:07:55.890 --> 01:07:59.521
and I really don't want to find
out, so... they're on my own.

846
01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:06.401
Well, fine then. You guys
can just... Go to the police.

847
01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:07.500
No.

848
01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:13.020
My dad got deported six months ago.

849
01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:16.140
I came home from school when he was gone.

850
01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:17.900
What about your mom?

851
01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:19.201
My mom died when I was five.

852
01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:21.660
It's just me and my dad.

853
01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.346
Except he never told me
he didn't have his papers,

854
01:08:24.370 --> 01:08:27.400
so I've just been living by
myself in our apartment since then.

855
01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:28.780
You're on your own? I don't.

856
01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:32.280
I don't need anyone
else to look out for me.

857
01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:35.741
And I don't have a girlfriend either.

858
01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:40.460
So I can't go to the police.

859
01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:43.060
Okay? Until I'm 18.

860
01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:44.880
I can't exist.

861
01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:47.931
And there's no way I'm
getting deported, too.

862
01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:49.760
Or going into the foster system.

863
01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:57.800
Well... the foster system
isn't always that terrible.

864
01:09:01.450 --> 01:09:03.220
Things didn't turn out so bad for me.

865
01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:05.120
Right.

866
01:09:08.490 --> 01:09:10.970
Cassie, please help us.

867
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:31.130
No one survives once enough
doors and enters their system.

868
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:33.230
You won't be so lucky next time.

869
01:11:34.330 --> 01:11:35.410
But why are you doing this?

870
01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:37.830
I need to solve the problem.

871
01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:40.390
They're not killers.

872
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:41.830
They're just teenagers.

873
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:44.230
In the future, I have done much more.

874
01:11:44.370 --> 01:11:46.950
In the future, they will destroy me.

875
01:11:47.210 --> 01:11:48.250
And everything I've built.

876
01:11:49.670 --> 01:11:51.330
Those girls cannot exist.

877
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:53.810
How are you going to decide?

878
01:11:54.530 --> 01:11:56.070
Because I'm the one with the powers.

879
01:11:59.590 --> 01:12:03.530
If you knew where I'd go,
you'd do the same thing.

880
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:09.610
Well, I knew the price to
pay was the lives of three girls.

881
01:12:09.611 --> 01:12:12.350
My young woman and I have
been almost done in the future.

882
01:12:12.610 --> 01:12:13.610
They also have powers.

883
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:16.510
The girls?

884
01:12:16.890 --> 01:12:18.950
The girls have the powers in the future.

885
01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:22.350
Because if you can beat me
with your mind, you can beat me.

886
01:12:22.450 --> 01:12:24.070
Your mother underestimated me.

887
01:12:24.071 --> 01:12:25.550
Mother underestimated me.

888
01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:27.230
You made me the power of the star.

889
01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:29.950
Don't make me say the same thing.

890
01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:31.950
Tell me where they are.

891
01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:33.810
They don't mean it effectively.

892
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:35.870
You never do.

893
01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:57.900
You never do.

894
01:13:39.690 --> 01:13:44.800
Okay, so this guy's hands
somehow release an acute neurotoxin.

895
01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:46.260
And it is painful.

896
01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:50.880
I was lucky. The longer he holds onto
you, the more poison gets into your system.

897
01:13:51.230 --> 01:13:52.230
Then what happens?

898
01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:54.620
Then your heart stops.

899
01:13:56.350 --> 01:13:59.140
But you can offset cardiac arrest with CPR.

900
01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:02.960
So, you interlock your hands like this.

901
01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:04.760
You lock your elbows.

902
01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:08.840
And then you place the heel of
your hand right on the sternum.

903
01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:10.920
And then you pump.

904
01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:13.140
And you want to go like two inches down.

905
01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:15.641
And you want to keep a
rhythm like a heartbeat.

906
01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:17.700
You ready?

907
01:14:17.701 --> 01:14:20.620
Okay, begin compressions. Go. Good.

908
01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:23.620
And when do I
stop? You don't stop.

909
01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:25.660
If you stop, they die.

910
01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:29.260
If you get tired, then you
need somebody to take over.

911
01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:31.260
I'm tired.

912
01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.320
Okay, Anya, get ready to take over.

913
01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:35.980
But you have to pick up
the exact same rhythm.

914
01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:37.500
Ready? Yeah.

915
01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:37.920
And go.

916
01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:39.340
Great.

917
01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:44.560
Yes, Matty?

918
01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:49.420
Julie, you want to
take over? Okay.

919
01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:50.640
Get ready.

920
01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:52.280
Okay.

921
01:14:54.410 --> 01:14:56.060
One, two, three.

922
01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:58.540
Nice job, Anya.

923
01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:05.240
I've never said this before in my
entire life, but you're a good teacher.

924
01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:11.140
Well, I've been learning some
things, too, about my mom.

925
01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:23.040
Wait, so you do know this guy?

926
01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.840
My mom did, I think. That's her.

927
01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:27.800
She's really pretty.

928
01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:33.510
So this is because of you?

929
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:39.050
All I know is that she
was researching spiders.

930
01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:43.290
In her notebook, there's
some stuff about a local

931
01:15:43.302 --> 01:15:46.150
tribe in Peru that can
do, like, crazy stuff.

932
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:48.310
No kind of crazy stuff.

933
01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:51.430
Climb like spiders.

934
01:15:53.650 --> 01:15:55.870
So is he one of them?

935
01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:58.030
I need more information.

936
01:16:02.230 --> 01:16:03.230
You're leaving.

937
01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:09.320
I have to go and figure
out what is going on.

938
01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.040
Who?

939
01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:15.020
He has to go to Peru.

940
01:16:18.770 --> 01:16:20.500
I'll be gone a week.
I don't want to leave them.

941
01:16:20.501 --> 01:16:22.750
But he's out there looking
for them, and they're relying

942
01:16:22.762 --> 01:16:24.741
on me, and I don't know
how else to protect them.

943
01:16:25.190 --> 01:16:27.264
Okay. Look, I'm staying down
there for a few weeks over.

944
01:16:27.276 --> 01:16:29.320
It's out of town. He
won't find them there.

945
01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:32.824
But Cassie, I can't
pretend to understand

946
01:16:32.836 --> 01:16:36.180
what's going on here.
Just be careful, okay?

947
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:40.000
I'll be back as soon as I can. Thank
you, Ben. You didn't ask for any of this.

948
01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:41.460
Okay, well neither did you.

949
01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:32.510
No, no, no, no.

950
01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:18.040
I promised your mother I would be here.

951
01:19:20.370 --> 01:19:22.630
My mom thought Las Arrannas were a myth.

952
01:19:23.370 --> 01:19:24.370
What do you think?

953
01:19:24.410 --> 01:19:26.570
I think she's crazy for coming here alone.

954
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:29.970
She came here hoping
to extract killing properties

955
01:19:29.982 --> 01:19:32.910
from the spiders. She thought
she was being protected.

956
01:19:33.610 --> 01:19:34.610
Bye, does he feel sense?

957
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:37.888
His motives were selfish.
He used your mom to find

958
01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:40.990
us. But because he stole
the spider, he was cursed.

959
01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:44.830
He's been trying to outrun
his destiny ever since.

960
01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:53.260
This is where my mom died?

961
01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:55.520
And where you were born?

962
01:20:01.290 --> 01:20:04.650
I don't understand why she
risked my life to come here.

963
01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:09.490
To see your future clearly, you
have to heal the wounds of your past.

964
01:20:10.030 --> 01:20:13.330
That sounds like literally every
therapy session I've ever avoided.

965
01:20:13.630 --> 01:20:17.110
You have to go back to your
beginning and keep going past that.

966
01:20:17.111 --> 01:20:21.590
You are powerless.
You don't even know you're capable of it.

967
01:20:22.010 --> 01:20:24.570
Your threat did not start
when you were born.

968
01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:29.460
Do you trust me?

969
01:20:32.130 --> 01:20:34.051
I'm not really sure if
this is my net of choice.

970
01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:43.640
You need to just walk away.

971
01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:46.260
Your threat did not start
when you were born.

972
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.620
She really is trying her best
to keep me from working.

973
01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:55.660
Not when I was close, but when
I'm not going to let her do that.

974
01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:57.660
Why did you hate
me so much? I care.

975
01:20:58.080 --> 01:20:59.080
Give it to me.

976
01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:01.940
I'm sorry.

977
01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:04.080
I'm sorry.

978
01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:05.800
I'm sorry.

979
01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:07.340
Give it to me.

980
01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:10.360
Give it to me.

981
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.640
Give it to me.

982
01:21:12.641 --> 01:21:13.020
Give it to me.

983
01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:13.900
Give it to me.

984
01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:15.480
I'm sorry.

985
01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:28.860
I'm sorry.

986
01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:30.140
I'm sorry.

987
01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:32.320
I'm sorry.

988
01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.700
That's what I used to cannot stand by.

989
01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:40.460
Have you tried for the
safety of your world?

990
01:21:57.810 --> 01:22:02.330
Your journey will not be
easy, but she is strong.

991
01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:13.740
Your test results came back.

992
01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:17.040
I'm sorry to tell you that
your mania is my zebra.

993
01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:20.420
It's a genetic neuro-muscular disorder.

994
01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:22.460
But I don't have a neuro-muscular disorder.

995
01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:23.720
Does that accept
disease? It varies.

996
01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:26.360
Do you need a tissue?

997
01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:27.420
No.

998
01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:28.760
No, I need the cure.

999
01:22:28.761 --> 01:22:31.060
I'm afraid there is no cure.

1000
01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:33.840
A single target nucleotide intervention.

1001
01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:37.920
It's experimental, but there are
some promising leads in the Amazon.

1002
01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:39.520
That's why you want that?

1003
01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:41.340
For me?

1004
01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:43.520
I have to advise you against traveling.

1005
01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:44.500
I'm sorry.

1006
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
What are you offering besides tissues?

1007
01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:48.960
I know this is hard to accept.

1008
01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:50.040
No, no.

1009
01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:54.940
I'm unwilling to accept a
diagnosis of helplessness.

1010
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:57.660
And I'm not going to teach
my daughter too either.

1011
01:23:09.930 --> 01:23:11.160
You did it.

1012
01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:14.380
I never knew I was sick.

1013
01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:17.340
The spider venom did
have healing properties.

1014
01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:22.700
I'm so sorry I spent so long being mine.

1015
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:09.830
I was not my mom didn't care about me.

1016
01:24:11.010 --> 01:24:13.590
Sometimes you must sacrifice
yourself for what you love.

1017
01:24:18.005 --> 01:24:18.720
I was there.

1018
01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:19.960
I was in the room.

1019
01:24:20.905 --> 01:24:22.040
I was in the room with her.

1020
01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:23.100
How did you do
that? You did that.

1021
01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:27.500
Now you're starting to
see what you're capable of.

1022
01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:30.420
You came here to learn
the truth about your past.

1023
01:24:31.690 --> 01:24:33.600
You will be ready to embrace your future.

1024
01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:38.160
Seeing into the future
is no match for Ezekiel.

1025
01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:41.340
I need to stop him
before he kills those girls.

1026
01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:43.160
But I can't do what he can do.

1027
01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:47.260
I can't do the leap egg,
crawly, like death poison.

1028
01:24:47.261 --> 01:24:50.360
You didn't get the gift
of the greater physical

1029
01:24:50.361 --> 01:24:52.540
strength or the ability
to release poison.

1030
01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:57.140
But seeing into the
future is only the start.

1031
01:24:57.940 --> 01:25:00.200
Your mind has infinite potential.

1032
01:25:00.850 --> 01:25:02.080
If you master your power,

1033
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:06.660
you can use the web to be in more
than one place at the same time.

1034
01:25:07.670 --> 01:25:10.640
You are the only one
who can change the future.

1035
01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:18.140
And when you take on the responsibility,
your ability to raise power will come.

1036
01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:36.980
I put death a bit closer.

1037
01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:41.160
And you still have found nothing?

1038
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.820
How can she forget the 32
natures hidden for a week?

1039
01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:47.040
I'm running checks every three minutes,

1040
01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:48.820
scanning CCTV camera.

1041
01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.680
I packed police and
emergency services frequencies.

1042
01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:53.580
I have eyes on all of their houses,

1043
01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.360
including friends and family.

1044
01:25:57.615 --> 01:25:58.615
Still nothing.

1045
01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:00.200
Do you understand?

1046
01:26:03.310 --> 01:26:04.760
Those girls cannot exist.

1047
01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:06.960
They will try to destroy me,

1048
01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:09.400
as I will you if you don't find them.

1049
01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:12.760
She can't hide them forever.

1050
01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:19.600
Okay, it's still pretty quiet out there.

1051
01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:21.020
What did I miss? Ben said words.

1052
01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:22.280
Oh, foreign.

1053
01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:29.600
Okay, let's try and remember to pick up
after ourselves Hey, woah, woah, woah, woah.

1054
01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:35.480
Guys, guys, either I paid
myself or my water broke.

1055
01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:38.560
Ew.

1056
01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:42.020
Well, honestly, you probably paid yourself
because that isn't supposed to happen yet.

1057
01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:45.860
Richard's not here, and the
baby isn't due for four weeks.

1058
01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:48.140
I don't think the baby got the medal, Ben.

1059
01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:49.440
Okay, okay, okay.

1060
01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:54.760
Looks like we may have to wait a
little while for the roll ambulance.

1061
01:26:54.761 --> 01:26:57.100
The baby is not waiting.

1062
01:26:57.380 --> 01:26:58.380
He's coming.

1063
01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:00.120
Now, now.

1064
01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:02.940
Uh, like here, in the dining room?

1065
01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:06.000
If Ben doesn't get me
to the hospital, then yes.

1066
01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:10.420
Okay, uh, uh, get in the car.

1067
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.380
Okay, okay, sleep helps everybody.

1068
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Seriously? Let's go.

1069
01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:32.880
Uh, never mind.

1070
01:27:59.390 --> 01:28:00.710
Red house and Ben.

1071
01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:10.200
I've intercepted a call to the hospital.

1072
01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:11.740
Same time it is.

1073
01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:12.800
Track the route.

1074
01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:13.860
Track it.

1075
01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:32.960
Yeah.

1076
01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:54.281
Is this the... Hospital, Ben.

1077
01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:56.860
Get off me, get off me, get off me!

1078
01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:00.820
Shit! Sorry, guys.

1079
01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:13.600
Don't care.

1080
01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:34.928
So the last one was 3 minutes and 24
seconds after the previous one, so that

1081
01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:40.980
means the time between contractions
is increasing at a rate of 21.6 seconds.

1082
01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:43.320
That was pretty fast.

1083
01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:47.040
You better hurry up, I'm not
sticking around if it gets gross.

1084
01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:49.540
This is the south last offer in an avenue.

1085
01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:51.980
I'll count them off on the
second avenue intersection.

1086
01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:54.040
Try faster!

1087
01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:55.660
Let's go, let's go, please.

1088
01:29:57.260 --> 01:29:58.260
No!

1089
01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:06.240
Back into traffic control.

1090
01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:08.300
Turn the lights green.

1091
01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:11.480
Amaria, now.

1092
01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:13.040
Do not have a lights to green.

1093
01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:17.780
Why is no one stopping you?

1094
01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:20.160
Get out of here!

1095
01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:22.380
You're not stopping me!

1096
01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:23.760
Whoa, whoa!

1097
01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:25.800
Yes, he's pulling the lights out!

1098
01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:29.120
Everyone okay? Yeah.

1099
01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:30.680
Are you okay? Yeah.

1100
01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:38.800
Um... What is that?

1101
01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:44.060
Oh my god, that's heaven.

1102
01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:46.160
Guys?

1103
01:30:58.340 --> 01:31:00.400
Don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go!

1104
01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:34.880
Get out of the way, get the ambulance,
come on, it's not over, come on.

1105
01:31:36.161 --> 01:31:40.140
Ben, I need you to get married
as far away as possible, okay?

1106
01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:41.820
As you go, he won't care about you now.

1107
01:31:42.340 --> 01:31:43.340
What about you?

1108
01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:45.940
I'd like to marry when
you need to make plans.

1109
01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:09.880
You're showing off? Yeah.

1110
01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:13.800
Uh, I think we lost him.

1111
01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:19.520
Okay.

1112
01:32:19.521 --> 01:32:21.001
Get in the back and charge that easy.

1113
01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:23.080
I want you to do it though.

1114
01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:26.720
Okay, press charge.

1115
01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:32.220
I think I'm moving hard to the
top, I'm moving hard to the top.

1116
01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:35.100
Okay, get ready.

1117
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.920
I'm close to the ceiling, don't
really touch the sides of anything.

1118
01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:02.310
Okay.

1119
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:07.030
Now you're showing off.

1120
01:33:07.570 --> 01:33:08.570
Maybe a little.

1121
01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:40.860
Those looks good, guys.

1122
01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:42.600
It's a death trap.

1123
01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:43.620
Anything potential.

1124
01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:47.240
Attack when it's closest.

1125
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Get down!

1126
01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:51.560
Go, go!

1127
01:34:03.150 --> 01:34:08.950
I have a code 30, PD 36307, requesting
airless support dockside queens.

1128
01:34:16.650 --> 01:34:17.930
It's gonna get a little crazy.

1129
01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:19.590
It's already crazy.

1130
01:34:20.210 --> 01:34:21.210
You didn't lay on us.

1131
01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:25.050
Whatever happens, I promise
I'm going to protect you guys.

1132
01:34:25.330 --> 01:34:26.370
We'll protect each other.

1133
01:34:26.850 --> 01:34:27.850
Don't run this together.

1134
01:34:28.850 --> 01:34:29.850
Right? Yeah.

1135
01:34:32.530 --> 01:34:34.050
Okay, we are still not doing our work.

1136
01:34:34.850 --> 01:34:36.370
I know, that's not cool.

1137
01:34:36.371 --> 01:34:37.830
Let's go, now go back.

1138
01:34:38.290 --> 01:34:39.290
All right, go, go, go.

1139
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:51.170
This doesn't look safe.

1140
01:34:51.730 --> 01:34:54.590
Well, it's full of explosives
and it's structurally unsound.

1141
01:34:54.750 --> 01:34:55.870
Yeah, it doesn't sound safe.

1142
01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:57.590
It's a death trap.

1143
01:34:58.990 --> 01:34:59.990
That's a good thing.

1144
01:35:00.510 --> 01:35:02.270
As long as we're not
the one to get trapped.

1145
01:35:03.570 --> 01:35:06.270
No matter what happens,
we need to work together.

1146
01:35:09.010 --> 01:35:10.510
Well, let's make this time possible.

1147
01:35:11.230 --> 01:35:12.610
Yeah, and we won't be impulsive.

1148
01:35:13.570 --> 01:35:14.570
Are we ready?

1149
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:21.070
We have to get to the roof.

1150
01:35:21.570 --> 01:35:22.770
It's gonna be here any minute.

1151
01:35:22.990 --> 01:35:24.650
Here, take these.

1152
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:27.170
Put them in as many crates as you can.

1153
01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:33.300
Okay.

1154
01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:35.640
You two, go that way.

1155
01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:37.160
We need to slow them down.

1156
01:35:37.660 --> 01:35:37.680
Right.

1157
01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:39.300
Keep them with me.

1158
01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:46.300
I'm coming for you.

1159
01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:53.660
I'm coming for you.

1160
01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:02.280
I'm coming for you.

1161
01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:38.240
Let it go, run, run for yourself.

1162
01:36:47.470 --> 01:36:53.150
You are going to the south side.

1163
01:36:53.151 --> 01:36:54.391
You're going to the south side.

1164
01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:01.480
Keep your wings to the south side.

1165
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:24.270
I need you to help me.

1166
01:39:27.070 --> 01:39:30.410
I need you to help me.

1167
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:32.510
I need you to help me.

1168
01:39:32.511 --> 01:39:42.010
I need you to help me.

1169
01:39:43.170 --> 01:39:47.170
You can't stay all free.

1170
01:39:47.171 --> 01:39:54.790
And when you take on the response
of duty, great power will come.

1171
01:40:01.450 --> 01:40:07.830
You're gonna be okay.

1172
01:40:33.390 --> 01:40:41.090
I need you to help me.

1173
01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:47.740
What makes you so short?

1174
01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:24.360
You look like a change in the future.

1175
01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:04.220
I need you to help me.

1176
01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:31.100
We're still here crossing you.

1177
01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:32.280
We're not leaving you.

1178
01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:36.220
I wouldn't be here if I
weren't for the three of you.

1179
01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:37.640
Right back at you.

1180
01:44:38.670 --> 01:44:41.020
And so the twin of the
baby's doing really well.

1181
01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:42.940
He's loving being an uncle.

1182
01:44:43.685 --> 01:44:46.500
Yeah, all the fun and
none of the responsibility.

1183
01:44:48.490 --> 01:44:49.490
That's what he thinks.

1184
01:44:53.010 --> 01:44:54.720
Are you all immediate family?

1185
01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:56.740
Yes.

1186
01:44:57.820 --> 01:44:58.820
They're all mine.

1187
01:45:06.510 --> 01:45:07.510
Can I get you anything?

1188
01:45:08.070 --> 01:45:09.070
No.

1189
01:45:09.970 --> 01:45:11.650
I have everything I need right here.

1190
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:47.300
You left your junk mail downstairs.

1191
01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:50.740
And we got take-out.

1192
01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:53.000
I don't know how chicken is perfect.

1193
01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:54.440
Actually, no.

1194
01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:56.500
Bless you, Anya.

1195
01:45:56.740 --> 01:45:57.740
What? Thank you.

1196
01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:05.700
Maddie!

1197
01:46:06.220 --> 01:46:06.520
What?

1198
01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:07.920
I told you I'm starving.

1199
01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:09.860
And I told you that is pretty good.

1200
01:46:09.861 --> 01:46:11.320
I wouldn't like you if you were hungry.

1201
01:46:11.321 --> 01:46:14.320
Well, I wouldn't, so...

1202
01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:16.320
How should I say?

1203
01:46:16.510 --> 01:46:18.200
I can see better than I ever have.

1204
01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:19.540
Oh, yeah?

1205
01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:22.020
Can you see us in the future?

1206
01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:23.900
Yes.

1207
01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:26.440
I can see you.

1208
01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:29.820
Standing up for what you believe.

1209
01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:36.840
Never looking back.

1210
01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:45.200
Considering you are always
more powerful than you thought.

1211
01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:48.260
Nothing I didn't already know.

1212
01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:53.320
I don't know about you two, but...

1213
01:46:54.220 --> 01:46:55.460
That totally makes sense to me.

1214
01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:57.040
What? I'm serious.

1215
01:46:57.580 --> 01:46:58.580
Wow.

1216
01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:01.560
Wow, I'm being serious.

1217
01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:20.050
Whatever the future holds.

1218
01:47:24.430 --> 01:47:25.430
We'll be ready.

1219
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:29.870
I don't know the best
thing about the future.

1220
01:47:31.970 --> 01:47:33.050
It has nothing left.
