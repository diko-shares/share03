1
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.420
You think we're in close?

2
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.680
They're almost impossible to find.
No one's ever captured one alive.

3
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.225
I agree to provide
security to you because I

4
00:01:48.237 --> 00:01:50.200
thought you were close
to fighting the spider.

5
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.263
A little bit worth the
wait. Dead specimens

6
00:01:54.275 --> 00:01:57.680
show that the peptides
in the spider's venom...

7
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.760
...basically they supercharge
their cellular structure.

8
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.960
That spider can give superhuman
strength and power like Asarana.

9
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.687
Asarana? The mythical spider
people who run across the

10
00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:16.960
treetops and punish evil men
with their black poison pests?

11
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.080
I'd like to make my research on
science, not legends, Mr. Stamps.

12
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.240
Those powers are wasted here.

13
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.960
These little spiders have the
potential to cure hundreds of diseases.

14
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.620
Are you okay?

15
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.180
No. She's trying her best
to keep me from working.

16
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.080
But I'm not gonna let her do that.

17
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.440
I don't wanna live close.

18
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.380
Perhaps you should rest.

19
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.660
I don't have time.

20
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.900
Thank you. For the umbrella.

21
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.800
No!

22
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.740
Isn't she beautiful? Incredible, isn't it?

23
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.560
Something so small, so much power.

24
00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:50.561
Stop!

25
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.040
What are you doing?
I don't... I don't understand.

26
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.560
I've been searching
for that spider for years.

27
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.520
No, we could help so many people.

28
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.360
I'm interested in helping people. No one
helped me when my family was starting.

29
00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:12.280
My road was not as clear as yours.
We didn't have the same choices.

30
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.856
You're making the wrong decision.

31
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.000
You're making the wrong decision.

32
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.660
Get it to me.

33
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.280
You can't walk away.

34
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.120
Stop! Stop! Stop!

35
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.000
Her journey will not be
easy, but she is strong.

36
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.980
She will come back when she
needs answers, and when she does,

37
00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.580
I will be here for that.

38
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.950
This is 210 with a
42-year-old female, Code 3.

39
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.570
Guys, I've lost the pulse.
I'm starting compressions now.

40
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.550
Ben, what are you even doing back there?

41
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.670
Oh, you wanna come take over? I can drive.

42
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.490
It's not gonna ruin temp on my watch.

43
00:07:02.441 --> 00:07:04.640
How are you doing back there?

44
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.680
Well, last time when the vehicle
drifted like this, I was getting shot at.

45
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.920
I wouldn't want you to be
home, except for the army.

46
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.320
I never thought I'd be this
happy to be back in Queens.

47
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.940
Wait, you better been shot at in Queens?

48
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.600
Shouldn't you be in school?

49
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.080
Who puts off an ambulance?

50
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.160
Jesus.

51
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.920
Kids.

52
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.040
I'm gonna get roped in.

53
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.840
No, you're not. You're gonna be
in the backyard, growing with us.

54
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.220
I know how these things work, Ben.

55
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:50.600
Oh, do you? How do you know?

56
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.356
I thought you've never
been to a baby job.

57
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.420
Yeah, I'm careful not to get roped in.

58
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.131
I'm glad I caught you
before you headed back out.

59
00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.260
She's gonna be okay.

60
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.640
Who?

61
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:03.220
Your... patient.

62
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.720
Little boy wanted to say thank you.

63
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.340
You know what?
Mr. Ben Perker here did all the work, so...

64
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.420
Just take it.

65
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.040
Take it.

66
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.620
Take it.

67
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.060
Thanks, buddy.

68
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.200
I'm taking a receiver.

69
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.450
Are you all immediate family?

70
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
I'm her stepdaughter.

71
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.840
I think she might prefer...

72
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:31.350
Yeah, it's okay, Dad.

73
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.820
I'll see you guys back at your apartment.

74
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.240
Okay. Come on, buddy.

75
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:38.180
This is mine.

76
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:38.900
Okay.

77
00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:40.580
This one is for you.

78
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:42.780
Thanks so much.

79
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.340
What am I supposed to do with this?

80
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.760
Just put it in your pocket and
then throw it away somewhere else.

81
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:55.410
You can't even fold it.
It's like cardboard.

82
00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.520
Oh, come on.

83
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.720
We both hate family stuff.

84
00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.640
I think I have plans, anyway, so...

85
00:09:05.641 --> 00:09:08.720
Plans? Since when you have plans,
you're, like, impossible to pin down.

86
00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.100
Well, I like to keep my
options open, you know?

87
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.940
I might sleep in. I might go to the museum.

88
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.080
I might walk the dog.

89
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.140
You don't have a dog?

90
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.380
I might adopt one.

91
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:17.880
Return the favor.

92
00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.200
I suspect you were a bit more 
of a handful than a puppy.

93
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.060
I don't know what you're talking about.

94
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.660
I was a model foster kid.

95
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.340
I peed outside and everything.

96
00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:29.460
So, I, um...

97
00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.580
kind of met someone.

98
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.360
Oh, yeah?

99
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:35.820
Yeah.

100
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.960
What's this one name?

101
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.700
Oh.

102
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.700
Serious.

103
00:09:49.724 --> 00:10:19.724
<b><font color="#60ff00">Subtitle made by Guto for https://www.opensubtitles.org/</font></b>

104
00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.390
She's a lucky lady, then.

105
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:26.490
Thank you.

106
00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:27.770
Oh.

107
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.410
You have a winning personality,
I guess I got yours by mistake.

108
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:34.430
You're an asshole.

109
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:35.750
Here.

110
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:38.890
Let's see what your future holds for you.

111
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.500
What if I don't want to know?

112
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:43.690
Well, it's just a cookie.

113
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:50.370
You will.

114
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:52.010
You will what?

115
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:54.990
Apparently I have no future.

116
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.530
Cassie, do you know what this means?

117
00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:58.730
What?

118
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.310
It means that their printer is broken.

119
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:03.570
We can't eat here anymore.

120
00:11:19.125 --> 00:11:20.625
We''l have it for you tomorrow,

121
00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.010
My dad just needs to 
pick up his paycheck.

122
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.656
Let me come in and talk
to your dad,

123
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.580
I haven't seen him in a while,
I'm worried something happened.

124
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.980
He's not home right now, actually.

125
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.560
Look, I'll be back tomorrow.
But no more excuses.

126
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:32.940
I swear!

127
00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.140
We'll have it!

128
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.720
All right.

129
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.320
Us strays need to stick together.

130
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.960
Somebody's hungry.

131
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.200
I hope the spiders were worth it, Mom.

132
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:55.790
B-A, three vechicles, one vehicle...

133
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:57.950
Seems to be overturned
and there's traffic.

134
00:13:57.971 --> 00:13:59.870
Copy that. Sending backup
to your location.

135
00:13:59.871 --> 00:14:00.975
It won't open!

136
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.080
Alright sir, we're gonna
get you out of there, ok?

137
00:14:04.104 --> 00:14:05.504
Just don't move.

138
00:14:05.881 --> 00:14:07.100
Hi, sir!

139
00:14:07.924 --> 00:14:08.924
Can you tell me your name?

140
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.020
Robert.

141
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.860
Robert? I'm Cassie.

142
00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.020
I'm gonna help you out, okay?

143
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.680
You're gonna be all right.

144
00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.040
All right, I'm gonna cut your seatbelt,
and when I do, you're gonna fall,

145
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.360
and my partner's gonna help
you out on that side, okay?

146
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.080
Three, two, one.

147
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.680
All right, Robert.

148
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.800
One, two, three.

149
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.240
Ok, you're gonna be ok, sir. 
Just try and...

150
00:14:34.164 --> 00:14:35.564
Hey! Cassie!

151
00:14:35.588 --> 00:14:36.588
Ben!

152
00:14:36.612 --> 00:14:37.712
Cassie!

153
00:14:37.736 --> 00:14:38.736
Ben!

154
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:05.820
(whispers)

155
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.040
(whispers)

156
00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.380
(whispers)

157
00:15:08.381 --> 00:15:09.381
(whispers)

158
00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.760
You guys are ice cold.

159
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.680
"Cassie!"

160
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.600
"This has always been a death trap"

161
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.640
"No need to press"

162
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.080
(whispers)

163
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.500
"You can't save those three!"

164
00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.760
"You are the only one
who can change the future"

165
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:34.620
"Cassie!"

166
00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.320
"C'mon Cassie, breath!"

167
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.760
Come on!

168
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.960
You're ok.

169
00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.560
Did I die?

170
00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.140
Yeah, you were down three
minutes before I fished you out.

171
00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.660
Three minutes? Yeah.

172
00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.600
Welcome back to the land of the living.

173
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:11.370
79 over 55, you need a real work-up
at a real hospital with a real doctor.

174
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:12.530
I don't need a doctor.

175
00:16:13.535 --> 00:16:14.535
I trust you.

176
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:17.030
80%! That's great.

177
00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.670
Slightly above that of a... dead fish.

178
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:21.750
Ah..?

179
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.750
All right, O2 is going up to 89...

180
00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.470
Jump back in the water any time.

181
00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:42.130
79 over 55, you need a real work-up
at a real hospital with a real doctor.

182
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:45.890
Seriously, Ben, dial it back. I'm fine.

183
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.200
Wait, wait, wait.
I need to get your oxygen levels.

184
00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.310
Again?

185
00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:52.590
What are you talking about?

186
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:53.850
My O2 is 89.

187
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:58.470
No, it's nah...

188
00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:00.510
Oh, you're right.

189
00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.830
Are you okay? What the
hell happened down there?

190
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:08.010
Fine!

191
00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:10.990
I just want to go home and watch Idol.

192
00:18:36.425 --> 00:18:37.425
Wow.

193
00:18:39.249 --> 00:18:40.249
Great apartment.

194
00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:07.890
Where's my spider?

195
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:09.210
They took my spider!

196
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:19.540
Who are you?

197
00:20:02.725 --> 00:20:04.725
Bad dream...?

198
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:05.850
It's not a dream.

199
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.550
I'm going to be murdered one day.

200
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.610
Oh, wow, that's a buzzkill.

201
00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.030
The same three faces.

202
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.230
Every night, the same vision.

203
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:23.250
It's a curse.

204
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:25.330
But we all die someday.

205
00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:27.630
Nothing we can really do to stop that.

206
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:33.090
If you saw who is going to
murder you, you'd try to stop them.

207
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:35.630
Okay.

208
00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:42.750
You have no idea of the torment and
torture of dying over and over again.

209
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:44.230
And I can't escape it.

210
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.360
So I'm not going to sit
back and let it happen.

211
00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:53.070
I will find them and kill them first.

212
00:20:55.210 --> 00:21:00.150
So you know who did... I mean, will do it?

213
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.470
It's always those three faces.

214
00:21:05.971 --> 00:21:08.884
Can you imagine how frustrating it's been,

215
00:21:09.796 --> 00:21:13.030
Trying to identify someone
I've only seen in a vision?

216
00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:20.470
But as the years pass, there
have been technological advances.

217
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:24.190
New ways to find people
if you know their faces.

218
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:30.910
The kind of technology I've heard the
National Security Agency has been pursuing.

219
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:48.800
What are you doing?

220
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.240
How are you poisoning me?

221
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.120
What's your password?

222
00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.860
I can't tell you... oh, please!

223
00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:59.820
Yes, please, your password.

224
00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.340
Tell me quickly before the 
paralysis reaches your lips,

225
00:22:04.364 --> 00:22:06.364
And I'll stop the poison.

226
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:22.660
Q-9-2-0-B-3-7-5

227
00:22:33.635 --> 00:22:35.135
Believe me,

228
00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:39.170
It's a good thing you had no idea today
was the day we were going to die.

229
00:22:52.865 --> 00:22:53.865
Hey, Cass!

230
00:22:53.889 --> 00:22:54.889
Hey.

231
00:22:56.565 --> 00:22:57.665
Hey, Neil.

232
00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.090
Hey, Cassie!

233
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:06.470
Hey, next time you want to go swimming,
maybe you should stick to a story apart.

234
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.790
Oh, that's really funny.
You're such a funny guy.

235
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:10.790
Are you pressing the burgers?

236
00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:12.450
I'm releasing the fat!

237
00:23:13.035 --> 00:23:15.635
That's called flavour, man.
Plus, it's like, really flammable.

238
00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:16.830
There you go.

239
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:17.870
Oh, thanks.

240
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:20.950
You don't think that maybe in light
of recent events I could use a beer?

241
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:26.810
Well, as you know, the protocol is no
booze within 24 hours of your death.

242
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:28.310
Is that protocol?

243
00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:29.670
Yeah, it's a protocol.

244
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:30.950
That's boring.

245
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:32.790
I feel like there's more of a story there.

246
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:36.390
No, you guys, we've seen this a
hundred times. It was cardiac arrest.

247
00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:38.910
When your heart starts
back up again, you're fine.

248
00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:41.090
Really?

249
00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:45.670
Dead, huh?
Did you see a white light or...

250
00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:51.510
Well, actually, I saw Jersey, so you
tell me...

251
00:23:51.634 --> 00:23:53.146
Oh, come on. You saw Jersey.

252
00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:53.630
Hey.

253
00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:54.930
What did Jersey do?

254
00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:57.290
Was he pressing the burgers again?

255
00:23:57.290 --> 00:23:58.510
Yeah, they're ruined now.

256
00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:00.010
For you, sir...?

257
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.880
Oh, now they're really ruined.

258
00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:03.770
Ready to start.

259
00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:04.810
What?

260
00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:07.610
What?
They're starting, so you should get in there.

261
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:09.990
No, you were right. They're roping you in.

262
00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:11.050
Yeah, thank you so much.

263
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:12.070
You're welcome.

264
00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:13.210
Have fun.

265
00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:21.350
Hey... This is crazy!

266
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:22.550
I can't decide what I have to.

267
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:29.250
Hi, I'm Cassie Webb. Thanks for having me.

268
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.870
You're Ben's partner.
I'm his sister-in-law.

269
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:32.930
Mary.

270
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.990
Nice to meet you.

271
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.650
Ben is so excited about being an uncle.

272
00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:38.656
I don't know what we'd do without him.

273
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:39.940
Especially with Richard away.

274
00:24:40.275 --> 00:24:42.210
Again, where is it this time?

275
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.210
He's in Mumbai, Shanghai.
I can't keep track.

276
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:53.170
Never stops leaping around
in there and always hungry.

277
00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:55.550
Does it have a name?

278
00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.320
We're saving that for the games.

279
00:25:01.344 --> 00:25:02.344
Games...?

280
00:25:02.368 --> 00:25:03.568
Games! Oh, my god...

281
00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.620
My mother always cut the
crusts off my sandwiches.

282
00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.680
Chloe, is that you?

283
00:25:18.881 --> 00:25:19.881
Yes.

284
00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.220
My mom said the crusts
would make my hair go curly.

285
00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:26.570
It was years before I figured that one out.

286
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:34.010
Who's is this?

287
00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:36.670
Oh, it's mine.

288
00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.070
You must have at least one
thought memory of your mother.

289
00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:44.810
Well, my mother
actually died in childbirth.

290
00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:48.610
Oh, well... But it wasn't that bad.
It wasn't.

291
00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:52.510
Like, I mean...Obviously, it was 
baaad, you know. She died.

292
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:57.450
But, ahn... I grew up totally healthy.

293
00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:01.810
Death in childbirth is super rare.
I mean...

294
00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:06.330
She chose to be, like, way deep in the 
Amazon for the last month of her pregnancy,

295
00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:09.920
Hundreds of miles away
from any medical facilities, so...

296
00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:13.470
Okay, so let's move on to the next one.

297
00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:17.310
Guess the name of Mary's baby.

298
00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:20.590
Okay, I'll kick things off.

299
00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:23.810
Sam.

300
00:26:23.834 --> 00:26:24.786
Nope!

301
00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:25.786
Steven!

302
00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:27.170
He's not named Steven.

303
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:28.950
You guys are ice cold.

304
00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:36.510
Richard Jr...?

305
00:26:36.511 --> 00:26:37.511
Richard wishes.

306
00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:42.190
Cassie, what's your guess?

307
00:26:52.835 --> 00:26:53.835
Ben...?

308
00:26:53.859 --> 00:26:55.059
The name is...

309
00:27:04.735 --> 00:27:06.035
Richard Jr...?

310
00:27:06.059 --> 00:27:07.636
Richard wishes.

311
00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:10.660
Cassie.

312
00:27:11.031 --> 00:27:12.570
What's your guess?

313
00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.870
Wait, we just did this.

314
00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:22.390
What, seriously, is this part of the game?

315
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:27.810
Uh... sorry, they're calling everyone in.
Fire down in the docks.

316
00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:30.010
So...

317
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:33.430
You okay?

318
00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:37.010
Yeah, I just... got a weird sense of deja vu.

319
00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.770
Ok, looks like a fractured left radius,
otherwise stable.

320
00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.380
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

321
00:27:58.500 --> 00:27:59.500
Check his abdomen.

322
00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.360
Ouch!

Hey,

323
00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.940
And... internal injuries.

324
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.080
Good catch.

325
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.320
Hey, I need to get my guys in there.

326
00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.020
It doesn't sound safe, the
structure is unstable.

327
00:28:15.144 --> 00:28:16.196
People are trapped.

328
00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.900
We need to treat them before we move them.

329
00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.540
This place is packed with explosives.

330
00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.480
Industrial grade fireworks.

331
00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:23.660
Ignore them!

332
00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.160
Ignore them!

333
00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.280
Cassie!

334
00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:33.620
Cassie!

335
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.320
This place is always
been a death trap.

336
00:28:40.744 --> 00:28:42.244
C'mon, this way! Get around!

337
00:28:42.268 --> 00:28:43.396
Otherwise stable.

338
00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:44.660
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

339
00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:45.740
Check his abdomen.

340
00:28:47.064 --> 00:28:49.064
And... internal injuries. Good catch!

341
00:28:49.388 --> 00:28:50.888
Let's go! Come on!

342
00:28:55.795 --> 00:28:56.995
I gotta get my guys in there.

343
00:28:57.019 --> 00:28:58.519
The structure is unstable.

344
00:28:58.543 --> 00:28:59.743
Hey, people are trapped.

345
00:28:59.767 --> 00:29:01.267
The place is packed... with explosives.

346
00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:02.791
Industrial grade fireworks.

347
00:29:02.815 --> 00:29:04.296
This place has always been a death trap.

348
00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.140
Cassie! Cassie! Cassie!

349
00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:07.940
I need you at the triage!

350
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.760
Sir, you're okay. You're okay.

351
00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.600
He's stable, ready to transport.

352
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:16.580
You're gonna be okay.

353
00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:19.580
Wait!

354
00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.760
O'Neil!

355
00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.600
Hey, what is it? I gotta roll.

356
00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:23.860
Will you let me drive?

357
00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:25.640
What are you talking about?

358
00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.240
I just... I don't know, I just...
Have a weird feeling.

359
00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:29.880
Cassie, I need you over here.

360
00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.000
Will you just let me drive?

361
00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.860
You had a bad experience on the job.

362
00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.560
I don't think that's what's happening.

363
00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.000
Don't let it mess with your head.

364
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
This is O'Neil, clear up dock side.
It is...

365
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.400
O'Neil. Come on.

366
00:30:25.124 --> 00:30:27.624
Come on! O'Neil! Come on!

367
00:30:32.548 --> 00:30:33.548
Wake up!

368
00:30:34.272 --> 00:30:35.972
O'Neil, come on!

369
00:30:36.941 --> 00:30:38.700
O'Neil, come on!

370
00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.980
Cassie! Cassie!

371
00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.000
Come on, come back!

372
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.400
Come on, come on!

373
00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.200
Ben, help me!
Cassie, Cassie, it's ok... it's ok.

374
00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.840
It's okay, okay?

375
00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.440
There's nothing you could
have done, okay?

376
00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:37.460
So, was it worth the trouble?

377
00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.220
The scale of the NSA's
surveillance is unprecedented.

378
00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.080
They can access everything.

379
00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.960
There's... there's nowhere to hide.

380
00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.120
That's the idea.

381
00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:48.420
The potential is infinite.

382
00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:51.220
It's... it's intoxicating, but...

383
00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.420
in the wrong hands, I mean...

384
00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.880
people can be tracked wherever they go.

385
00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.360
It's going to change everything.

386
00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.420
As long as it has the ability
to find those women now,

387
00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:04.120
before they get their powers.

388
00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.760
This is what they look
like in your visions,

389
00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.080
as well as you can recollect.

390
00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.220
Their faces have been
daunting me for years.

391
00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.760
We don't know exactly
when your vision takes place,

392
00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.120
so I'm giving this a 10-year
range just to be safe.

393
00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.160
Here's what they should look like now.

394
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.460
They're younger than I thought, I...

395
00:32:28.184 --> 00:32:30.256
I didn't know we'd be targeting teenagers.

396
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.720
They're teenagers now, but in the future,

397
00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.520
they have powers, and
they will try to destroy me.

398
00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:37.940
I came from nothing, less than nothing.

399
00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.600
I will not give up everything I've built,

400
00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.080
and have my life cut short.

401
00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:49.900
I'll say, ride public transportation, go to
the museum, get money from an ATM,

402
00:32:50.965 --> 00:32:52.205
wherever they are in the world.

403
00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.640
Find them.

404
00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:56.260
I pay you a fortune.

405
00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:58.220
Yeah, I'll find them.

406
00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.000
Still no blurriness, no double vision,

407
00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.060
no discoloration at all.

408
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:08.840
Your eyesight is good,

409
00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:10.900
and all your other vitals check out.

410
00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.580
Ahm... but what about the visions?

411
00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.480
How am I seeing that stuff?

412
00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.240
Sometimes, when we experience trauma,

413
00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:21.720
it can have a lasting effect.

414
00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:23.020
This isn't trauma.

415
00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:25.120
I knew he was gonna die.

416
00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:27.580
I saw it.

417
00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:30.981
Cassie, I have all your reports
here from your other consultations.

418
00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.280
Your head CT was
normal, your MRI was clear.

419
00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.700
The scan showed no abnormality.

420
00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.060
I know that it sounds crazy.

421
00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.240
I know, but I don't
understand what's happening.

422
00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.600
I will be recommending
that you take a week off.

423
00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.840
Get some rest.

424
00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.300
Watch old movies.

425
00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:47.160
If you still have concerns,

426
00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:48.980
I can run some bloods or
refer you to psych.

427
00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:52.900
But I'm sure everything will be
back to normal before you know it.

428
00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.700
I have been to present, seems...

429
00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:58.940
Christmas is yet to come.

430
00:34:01.064 --> 00:34:04.564
And you british only shadows things that
not yet happened, but will happen...

431
00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:10.121
Spirit of the future, I fear you more
than any other specter I've seen...

432
00:34:10.745 --> 00:34:13.945
Even that fear I must deal with... 
I am doomed!

433
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:16.110
I can not change...

434
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:22.991
Hey Cassie, it's me again.

435
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:24.710
Ahn... Ben.

436
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:26.930
I know you're there, just pick up.

437
00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:30.690
Okay, well, uh...

438
00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.130
O'Neill's funeral starts at two 
in Poughkeepsie.

439
00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:34.291
Everyone is going.

440
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:37.290
I know, it's the last place you want to be.

441
00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:39.230
But it would help Susan.

442
00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.830
If you came... it might help you too.

443
00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:44.781
Look, if you leave now,
you can still make it.

444
00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:46.610
Cassie?

445
00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:48.930
Cass?

446
00:34:55.854 --> 00:34:58.554
Before I join the ones that stare,
answer me one question:

447
00:34:59.178 --> 00:35:01.878
Are this the shadows of things that must leave?

448
00:35:02.702 --> 00:35:05.402
Are they only shadows of things that might be?

449
00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:07.270
Hate to break it to you, Scrooge, but...

450
00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:09.930
you can't change anything.

451
00:35:46.515 --> 00:35:49.215
Are this the shadows of things that must leave?

452
00:35:49.939 --> 00:35:52.439
Are they only shadows of things that might be?

453
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.620
This isn't going to change anything.

454
00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:26.670
Guess is in tie of draw.

455
00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.260
May I have one to Poughkeepsie, please.

456
00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:32.580
Anya Corazón started moving 
onto the platform.

457
00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.300
She's on her own.

458
00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.100
Julia Cornwall is on the
concourse, also alone.

459
00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:44.900
And Martha Franklin.

460
00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.800
Shit!

461
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.780
What are the odds of them all being
in the same place at the same time?

462
00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:52.940
It's not a coincidence.

463
00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.220
There must be something that connects them.

464
00:37:55.355 --> 00:37:56.555
Or...

465
00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:58.920
Something that will.

466
00:37:59.221 --> 00:38:02.560
Please keep all belongings to 
you at all times.

467
00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:06.260
If you see something suspicious
find a member of the MTA staff.

468
00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.720
New York City is a whole
new level of crazy these days.

469
00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.340
This is the train to Mount Vernon, right?

470
00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:14.020
Is this real?

471
00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:15.960
Are you okay, dear?

472
00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.000
Oh god, I think I'm going crazy.

473
00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.900
New York City is a whole new
level of crazy these days.

474
00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.680
This is the train to Mount Vernon, right?

475
00:40:34.704 --> 00:40:36.104
I hope not.

476
00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.460
Get up. Get off. Get off.

477
00:41:16.461 --> 00:41:16.840
Get up.

478
00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:17.400
Me?

479
00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:18.280
Go, get off!

480
00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:19.580
You're gonna die if you stay here.

481
00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:20.000
Get up.

482
00:41:20.001 --> 00:41:21.500
What? Are you threatening us?

483
00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.100
This is an emergency situation.
I need you to follow my instructions.

484
00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.360
Get off the train.

485
00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:26.840
Come on.

486
00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.500
My mom told me never to talk
to strangers, so...

487
00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:29.500
Get up.

488
00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:30.740
Hey, give me that back.

489
00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.480
I'm so pressing charges.

490
00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.420
Okay, knock yourself out.

491
00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:41.020
Give me my humvee skateboard back.

492
00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.140
Let's go.

493
00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.260
Ok, nevermind.

494
00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:07.480
Gimme my freaking skateboard back.

495
00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:07.980
Okay.

496
00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.140
What exactly is this emergency?

497
00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:12.180
This woman is trying to abduct us!

498
00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.200
What? No! That's not...

499
00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.680
That's... shh!

500
00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.880
That's your emergency.
That.

501
00:42:27.104 --> 00:42:28.704
Is anybody else seeing this?

502
00:42:28.828 --> 00:42:30.028
That man is trying to kill you.

503
00:42:30.052 --> 00:42:32.052
But how you...?
I don't know, come on.

504
00:42:34.576 --> 00:42:36.076
We don't have tickets for this train!

505
00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:37.500
That's you biggest concern?

506
00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:39.170
Please, stay clear. Close doors.

507
00:42:39.994 --> 00:42:43.494
The train is departing. Please, be kind
removing your bags from empty seats...

508
00:42:43.518 --> 00:42:45.518
Place any luggage on the rack above.

509
00:42:46.442 --> 00:42:47.442
Come on.

510
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Ok.

511
00:42:57.124 --> 00:42:58.724
Hey. Am I on the right train?

512
00:42:59.148 --> 00:43:00.448
I don't know, man.

513
00:43:13.691 --> 00:43:14.691
Holy shit.

514
00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:15.810
Come on.

515
00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:25.340
Come.

516
00:43:27.364 --> 00:43:28.364
Run!

517
00:43:37.271 --> 00:43:39.551
There's an emergency exit, to
the street, that way.

518
00:43:39.575 --> 00:43:40.575
Go.

519
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.440
Hey, cops! Over here!

520
00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:43.980
I've never been so happy to see cops.

521
00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:45.336
You guys need to call for backup.

522
00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.360
That will not be necessary.

523
00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:47.260
As long as you cooperate.

524
00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.140
Wait, what? It's not what...

525
00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:49.540
You don't understand!
We are being attacked!

526
00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:50.600
We're beeing attacked!

527
00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:51.540
You're safe...

528
00:43:53.241 --> 00:43:54.241
Run! Go!

529
00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:56.350
Go.

530
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:03.470
Go, go, go.

531
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:04.790
Go, go, go, go.

532
00:44:57.935 --> 00:44:59.035
Come on!

533
00:45:02.959 --> 00:45:04.536
Just get in!
What? Get in!

534
00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:07.160
Come on! We're out of time!

535
00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:08.960
I appreciate it, thank you so much.

536
00:45:11.484 --> 00:45:13.684
That guy was nuts. Do you guys think
he killed those cops?

537
00:45:13.708 --> 00:45:15.546
He... he climbed on walls and
dodged bullets,

538
00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:16.870
How is that even possible?

539
00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:17.500
It's not.

540
00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:19.636
There's not enough friction or
force in the bare human foot to...

541
00:45:19.648 --> 00:45:21.636
to overcome gravity and 
keep him stuck to the wall.

542
00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:22.500
Even more to the ceiling.

543
00:45:23.124 --> 00:45:25.924
No science seems to stop him,
so what good is it?

544
00:45:25.948 --> 00:45:27.248
What good is science?

545
00:45:27.472 --> 00:45:28.272
Ok, enough.

546
00:45:28.296 --> 00:45:29.196
Please, don't fight...

547
00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:30.020
Enough.

548
00:45:29.944 --> 00:45:30.644
I was just telling...

549
00:45:30.568 --> 00:45:31.268
Enough!

550
00:45:31.592 --> 00:45:34.092
Your voices are, like, drilling in
the center of my skull,

551
00:45:34.116 --> 00:45:35.016
And I need to think.

552
00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:42.740
I'm Cassie.

553
00:45:43.164 --> 00:45:44.364
Ok? What are your names?

554
00:45:45.488 --> 00:45:46.888
What are your names?

555
00:45:46.912 --> 00:45:48.012
I'm Julia Cornwall.

556
00:45:48.036 --> 00:45:51.536
My... my dad lives here in New York
and my mom lives back in L.A. but...

557
00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:52.960
We don't need your whole life story.

558
00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:56.910
I'm Anya Corazón.

559
00:45:57.730 --> 00:45:58.730
Mattie Franklin.

560
00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:00.290
Thank you for protecting us.

561
00:46:00.291 --> 00:46:03.070
No, no, no.
That's not what's happening here.

562
00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:05.530
I'm not protecting you. I am...

563
00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:08.550
Your parents can handle this.

564
00:46:08.650 --> 00:46:10.066
My parents are on a business trip.

565
00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:11.670
Yeah, my parents are out of town, too.

566
00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:13.670
Oh, my mom's busy working, so...

567
00:46:13.694 --> 00:46:14.326
Oh, my god.

568
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:16.146
Oh, I was gonna go stay with some friends.

569
00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:18.230
Well, where are your friends live?
I'll drop you off first.

570
00:46:18.254 --> 00:46:20.754
<i>... public zone, and finding the person of
interest seen in an attack on... </i>

571
00:46:20.778 --> 00:46:24.478
<i>multiple NYPD officers at Grand Central 
terminal this afternoon.</i>

572
00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:25.930
That's great. Good.

573
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:28.310
Hope they find his crazy ass.

574
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:31.930
That was insane. They better lock him up.

575
00:46:31.954 --> 00:46:35.754
<i>she is also the same person police are
seeking to question in a possible abduction...</i>

576
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:36.710
She?

577
00:46:36.734 --> 00:46:40.434
<i>of the three teenage girls. Eye witnesses
have identified the woman in her early 30s,</i>

578
00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:42.970
What?

579
00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:45.510
What? That's...

580
00:46:45.511 --> 00:46:47.410
Look, you guys...
What about them?

581
00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:48.850
He was crawling on the ceiling.

582
00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:49.670
What about that guy?

583
00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:50.850
I mean, you saw...

584
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:52.230
No one saw a ceiling guy.

585
00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:53.770
Everyone thinks you're the kidnapper.

586
00:46:53.771 --> 00:46:55.550
Yeah, because you told them I was.

587
00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:56.930
I didn't know what was happening.

588
00:46:57.170 --> 00:46:58.170
Okay, guys.

589
00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:00.606
My Uncle Jonah can totally help us.
I'm going to call him.

590
00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:01.930
You have a phone?

591
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:03.870
You know they can track
those nowadays, right?

592
00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:06.510
Hey, you can't do that.

593
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:06.910
She's right.

594
00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:08.946
It's okay. Daddy will buy you a new one.

595
00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:09.570
What is your problem?

596
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:10.330
What do you mean?

597
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:11.470
I'm just trying to help.

598
00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:14.890
Okay, anyone who wants
to leave can leave right now.

599
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:16.070
Okay.

600
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:17.390
Wait.

601
00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:23.070
Sorry, no, you can't actually
leave because you guys

602
00:47:23.071 --> 00:47:24.071
are the only ones that know
what actually happened.

603
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:30.120
Okay, well, this is what
we're going to do, okay?

604
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.460
We're just going to,
like, lay low for a little bit.

605
00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:36.581
And, um... I'll figure
out how to get out of this.

606
00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:45.970
This is still not a kidnapping, okay?

607
00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:48.930
Feels like a kidnapping.

608
00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:52.620
How did they get away?

609
00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.600
It's like they knew I was coming.

610
00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:58.860
No hits at the train station in 
West Duval or any of the bridges.

611
00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.800
Wherever they are, there aren't any cameras.

612
00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:03.300
The police don't have this technology.

613
00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:06.060
You have access to
every camera in the city.

614
00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.240
We should be ahead of them.

615
00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:11.280
I went to a lot of trouble
to steal you these tools.

616
00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:12.960
Use them. Better.

617
00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.240
I always wanted to be a girl scout.

618
00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:17.280
Of course you did.

619
00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.240
Anybody else starving?

620
00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:21.140
All I have is gum.

621
00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.060
Here, I found this in
the glove compartment.

622
00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.036
Wait, that bag. It's already been open.

623
00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:29.536
We don't know how long it's been in there.

624
00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:32.060
Okay, I hope you're good
at, um, catching squirrels.

625
00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.800
Okay, so, what's the deal
with Ceiling Guy?

626
00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:37.220
I told you, I don't know.

627
00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:38.840
I've never seen him before.

628
00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:40.520
How did you know he was coming?

629
00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:43.860
I'm kind of more interested
in why he's trying to kill us.

630
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.620
I don't know.

631
00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:48.740
Crazy shit's been happening
and I don't know why.

632
00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:50.420
Stop asking me, okay?

633
00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:52.660
Wait, you're the paramedic.

634
00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:57.720
You saved my stepmother then
you were super awkward about it.

635
00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:01.300
That does sound like me.

636
00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:03.420
Wait, I recognize you too.

637
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000
What?

638
00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:06.640
Yeah, you live in my building.

639
00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:10.206
You leave your junk
mail in the lobby and then

640
00:49:10.218 --> 00:49:12.180
everybody else has
to clean it up for you.

641
00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:14.620
Okay, well, there should
be a recycling bin there.

642
00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:16.220
You don't think this is weird?

643
00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:18.680
That we both know you?

644
00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:22.060
It's honestly, like, the least
weird thing that's happened all day.

645
00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:26.550
What?

646
00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:30.150
Total stranger.

647
00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:32.310
No.

648
00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:34.810
You flipped me off.

649
00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:36.930
It's not really narrowing down much.

650
00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:38.190
You guys, this is so freaky.

651
00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:40.830
Who are you? What is going on?

652
00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:44.850
I can see the future.

653
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:47.870
Kind of.

654
00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:55.110
I mean...

655
00:49:55.811 --> 00:49:57.730
Oh, what the hell? See?

656
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:59.430
She didn't see that coming.

657
00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:01.150
It doesn't work like that.

658
00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:03.110
You guys, just give her a chance, please.

659
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:06.533
Wait, when you were
looking into the future,

660
00:50:06.545 --> 00:50:08.850
did you see us in the
middle of nowhere,

661
00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:13.150
eating love compartment or... Okay,
look, believe me or don't, I don't care.

662
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:15.684
I didn't ask to be
doing this with you and I

663
00:50:15.696 --> 00:50:17.950
didn't ask for this to
happen to me either.

664
00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:21.250
Also, I'm pretty sure I've
saved all of your lives.

665
00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:23.650
So, you're welcome.

666
00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:27.540
How does it work?

667
00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:31.090
It just happens.

668
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:32.730
Can you do it now?

669
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:35.790
I can't control it.

670
00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:38.790
You know the other guy can walk
on the ceiling, right?

671
00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:40.310
No, he can't.

672
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:42.930
He was using his hands.

673
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:44.970
Why are you like this?

674
00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:47.490
I'm just saying it was more of a crawl.

675
00:50:47.790 --> 00:50:51.430
It was like a spider... person.

676
00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:03.260
I'm gonna be back in a few hours.

677
00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:06.200
Where are you going?

678
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:09.800
I need to check some
things out about all of this.

679
00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:12.260
You can't just leave us here.

680
00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:14.660
We'll be okay, Julia, we
don't need a babysitter.

681
00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:16.440
Oh, yeah, sure, just three
teenagers alone in the woods,

682
00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.640
definitely not the opening of a horror film.

683
00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.280
You are way safer out here.

684
00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:25.560
Just, you know, be like a Girl Scout girl.

685
00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.660
Be that. Just... be that.

686
00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:29.061
Can you bring us some
sandwiches?

687
00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:30.740
Cassie!

688
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:33.960
Can we trust you?

689
00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:38.980
Three hours, okay?
Just stay here.

690
00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.320
And don't do anything dumb.

691
00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:48.540
Seriously, don't do dumb things.

692
00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:52.420
She was talking to you.

693
00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:55.680
Okay, well, you're just a bitch, so...

694
00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.160
I know Tae Kwon Do.

695
00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:04.980
You.

696
00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:09.201
I had a few rough years in school
when my parents were divorcing,

697
00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:12.640
so I wanted to feel like I
could fight back if I needed to.

698
00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:19.140
That's what I thought.

699
00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:31.930
One second, Kat.

700
00:53:35.854 --> 00:53:36.854
Come on...

701
00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:42.420
Research on Amazonian spiders.

702
00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:45.280
Peptides.

703
00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:46.620
More peptides.

704
00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:48.220
Where is it?

705
00:53:50.290 --> 00:53:51.500
Ah, spider people.

706
00:53:53.075 --> 00:53:54.075
Las Aranyas.

707
00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:57.141
Have you ever heard
of Las Aranyas?

708
00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:00.120
Me neither.

709
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:04.580
According to local folklore,

710
00:54:06.235 --> 00:54:09.240
they possess powers
derived from spider venom

711
00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:13.820
and are incredibly fast, incredibly strong,

712
00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:14.930
and...

713
00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:17.340
they can climb like spiders.

714
00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:21.440
Just like Ceiling Guy.

715
00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:32.540
How would you know if you could
climb a wall if you've never tried?

716
00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:52.050
Okay, let's not mention that to anybody.

717
00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:03.520
Las Aranyas are said
to possess a sixth sense

718
00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:06.640
as if they have the
ability to glimpse the future.

719
00:55:20.764 --> 00:55:21.864
Oh, my god.

720
00:55:40.810 --> 00:55:41.810
Hey, who's got the jerky?

721
00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.040
You ate it all.

722
00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:44.820
You had like three pieces.

723
00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:46.060
Out of five.

724
00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:47.440
You counted.

725
00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:48.680
You also ate all mine.

726
00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:52.440
What's this?

727
00:55:52.464 --> 00:55:53.864
Stop.

728
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:59.870
Ok. Forget jerky.

729
00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:01.410
Did you guys see that diner?

730
00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:03.171
Like a half mile down the road?

731
00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:05.186
Let's just go there and get real food.

732
00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:06.450
Cassie told us to stay here.

733
00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:07.510
Come on, Julia...

734
00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:08.530
She bailed on us.

735
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:10.370
We don't have any money, genius.

736
00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:12.250
Well, I have money. So...

737
00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:15.101
You have money so we
should do what you want?

738
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:16.910
You got something to say?

739
00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:19.050
You know, I bet...

740
00:56:19.130 --> 00:56:20.130
Your dad is a senator,

741
00:56:20.455 --> 00:56:22.066
and your mom sits on the board at the Met,

742
00:56:22.090 --> 00:56:24.371
and you somewhere in the
Hamptons next to Martha Stewart.

743
00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:25.710
So sad about Martha Stewart.

744
00:56:29.505 --> 00:56:30.630
My parents are in Beijing,

745
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:34.186
where my dad is raking in a ton of money for
making plastics that pollute the ocean,

746
00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:36.010
and my mom is spending
it all on hideous art.

747
00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:39.301
So... I talk to them on Mondays.

748
00:56:39.330 --> 00:56:40.730
So who do you live with?

749
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:42.390
The housekeeper.

750
00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:45.770
Well, on the upside, no curfew.

751
00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:48.701
I bet you have your own room at least.

752
00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:52.430
I live with my dad and
his wife and their kid.

753
00:56:53.130 --> 00:56:54.130
What about your mom?

754
00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:57.050
She's not really around.

755
00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:58.770
She bailed on you?

756
00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:01.490
Right, so...

757
00:57:01.691 --> 00:57:02.691
Diner?

758
00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:05.611
Let's spend some of Mattie's 
daddy's pollution money?

759
00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:08.091
Ey! I'm going to order 
everything on the menu.

760
00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:12.150
Julia, you in?

761
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:14.910
Hey.

762
00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:16.901
We have to take care of ourselves.

763
00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:25.180
Yeah.

764
00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:28.760
You're right.

765
00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:31.510
Let's go do this.

766
00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:35.000
She's kind of cute when she's mad.

767
00:57:35.615 --> 00:57:36.407
I heard that!

768
00:57:38.031 --> 00:57:40.491
We are making
the right decision, Julia.

769
00:57:40.591 --> 00:57:42.351
You would not like me when I'm hangry.

770
00:57:43.301 --> 00:57:44.451
Who says we like you now?

771
00:57:45.131 --> 00:57:46.131
God!

772
00:57:46.351 --> 00:57:48.051
I knew we shouldn't have done this.

773
00:57:52.831 --> 00:57:54.511
Do you think there's ticks?

774
00:57:56.791 --> 00:57:59.011
Can we walk...?
Julia. Faster, please?

775
00:57:59.601 --> 00:58:00.762
You said this was a shortcut.

776
00:58:01.051 --> 00:58:02.051
Are you lost?

777
00:58:02.411 --> 00:58:03.691
I don't know where you're going.

778
00:58:03.831 --> 00:58:04.871
Do you know where you're going?

779
00:58:04.951 --> 00:58:05.951
Actually, I do.

780
00:58:08.751 --> 00:58:09.751
Ow, shit!

781
00:58:13.811 --> 00:58:16.291
Okay, don't talk to anybody except to order.

782
00:58:16.391 --> 00:58:17.671
We're in the middle of nowhere.

783
00:58:17.351 --> 00:58:18.631
No one is gonna track us down here.

784
00:58:19.271 --> 00:58:20.271
Don't make eye contact.

785
00:58:20.971 --> 00:58:22.512
Oh, I will have cherry pie!

786
00:58:33.441 --> 00:58:34.441
Let's sit at the bar.

787
00:58:42.265 --> 00:58:43.265
There you go.

788
00:58:44.389 --> 00:58:45.389
Here.

789
00:58:47.051 --> 00:58:48.351
Should we make a game plan?

790
00:58:48.371 --> 00:58:49.371
Eat first...

791
00:58:49.591 --> 00:58:50.591
Strategize later.

792
00:58:51.791 --> 00:58:52.791
Tell me.

793
00:59:00.101 --> 00:59:02.331
Let's just eat quickly
and then get out of here.

794
00:59:02.951 --> 00:59:05.511
Absolutely great idea, I'll get
at it after cherry pie.

795
00:59:06.011 --> 00:59:07.011
No.

796
00:59:07.581 --> 00:59:08.731
No cherry pie.

797
00:59:11.141 --> 00:59:13.222
Julia, tell me you agree
that we should get dessert.

798
00:59:15.271 --> 00:59:19.211
Yeah, whatever you guys are arguing about
I'm sure both of you make really good points.

799
00:59:28.881 --> 00:59:30.631
We should go ahead and talk to them.

800
00:59:31.171 --> 00:59:32.171
Really?

801
00:59:33.121 --> 00:59:34.211
No, we we we kid...

802
00:59:35.771 --> 00:59:36.571
Should we?

803
00:59:36.595 --> 00:59:37.347
Wait, we can't.

804
00:59:37.571 --> 00:59:38.571
You know you want to.

805
00:59:38.571 --> 00:59:39.571
No.

806
00:59:39.971 --> 00:59:41.851
This is not a good idea.

807
00:59:42.071 --> 00:59:43.231
It's a good idea.
What are you doing?

808
00:59:43.191 --> 00:59:44.031
Yeah, what are you doing?

809
00:59:44.031 --> 00:59:44.851
Hold on a second.

810
00:59:45.371 --> 00:59:46.271
What is this?

811
00:59:47.895 --> 00:59:49.695
It's just a little confidence boost.

812
00:59:50.326 --> 00:59:52.191
This isn't really my style.

813
00:59:53.671 --> 00:59:54.691
It's all right.

814
00:59:54.791 --> 00:59:55.191
You look cute.

815
00:59:55.711 --> 00:59:56.931
This is not a good idea.

816
00:59:57.431 --> 00:59:58.431
Seriously, guys.

817
01:00:00.331 --> 01:00:00.591
Hi.

818
01:00:01.271 --> 01:00:01.911
Hey guys, how are you?

819
01:00:02.291 --> 01:00:03.291
How are you doing? Thanks a lot.

820
01:00:04.451 --> 01:00:05.451
Yeah, I'm doing great.

821
01:00:05.751 --> 01:00:06.151
Thanks a lot.

822
01:00:06.631 --> 01:00:07.631
Thank you.

823
01:00:08.291 --> 01:00:09.291
Okay.

824
01:00:10.316 --> 01:00:11.916
<i>Thank you for your information,</i>

825
01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:14.440
<i>Can you just confirm your location?
4 Star Diner, </i>

826
01:00:14.464 --> 01:00:17.164
<i>Dave's Road, Route 206.
Churchill, New Jersey.</i>

827
01:00:17.441 --> 01:00:19.381
Hey. Possible siting in 
Churchill, New Jersey.

828
01:00:19.401 --> 01:00:21.201
Connect me with Churchill Police Dispatch.

829
01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:22.141
Yeah.

830
01:00:22.321 --> 01:00:23.621
Patching you right now.

831
01:00:32.151 --> 01:00:33.151
Two-two-three dispatch.

832
01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:35.371
On scene of 4 Star Diner.

833
01:00:35.971 --> 01:00:37.331
Route 206 of Dave's Road.

834
01:00:37.711 --> 01:00:38.411
<i>Go ahead, two-two-three.</i>

835
01:00:38.631 --> 01:00:39.811
No need to send backup.

836
01:00:42.291 --> 01:00:43.731
These aren't our missing persons.

837
01:00:45.651 --> 01:00:46.651
Don't for.

838
01:00:47.851 --> 01:00:49.411
Repeat: These are not our 
missing persons.

839
01:00:53.431 --> 01:00:54.431
No.

840
01:00:59.571 --> 01:01:00.571
Girls?

841
01:01:34.851 --> 01:01:35.851
Girls?

842
01:01:51.871 --> 01:01:54.271
So much for not attracting attention.

843
01:02:09.511 --> 01:02:11.791
I won't even know that.

844
01:02:12.131 --> 01:02:13.631
We have to get off this.

845
01:02:16.611 --> 01:02:17.711
I'm so sorry.

846
01:02:20.771 --> 01:02:21.771
Get down.

847
01:02:23.131 --> 01:02:24.451
This isn't what you're thinking.

848
01:02:24.511 --> 01:02:24.851
Stop.

849
01:02:24.931 --> 01:02:25.931
You left us.

850
01:02:26.851 --> 01:02:28.031
I'm so sorry.

851
01:02:32.171 --> 01:02:33.171
Julia!

852
01:02:34.211 --> 01:02:35.351
Julia, get back!

853
01:02:36.811 --> 01:02:38.151
Julia, get back!

854
01:02:38.371 --> 01:02:39.371
Stop!

855
01:02:39.631 --> 01:02:40.631
Stop!

856
01:02:46.291 --> 01:02:47.431
Come on!

857
01:02:47.651 --> 01:02:48.651
No!

858
01:02:48.811 --> 01:02:49.811
No!

859
01:02:51.131 --> 01:02:52.131
No!

860
01:02:55.541 --> 01:02:56.541
No!

861
01:02:56.801 --> 01:02:56.821
No!

862
01:02:56.822 --> 01:02:57.822
No!

863
01:02:58.901 --> 01:02:59.901
Come on!

864
01:03:02.941 --> 01:03:03.941
No!

865
01:03:05.001 --> 01:03:06.001
No!

866
01:03:08.521 --> 01:03:09.521
No!

867
01:03:37.606 --> 01:03:39.047
This track is going to be huge.

868
01:03:39.511 --> 01:03:40.511
Are you in the zone?

869
01:03:40.631 --> 01:03:41.631
This is Britney Spears.

870
01:03:45.051 --> 01:03:46.971
Let's try that again.

871
01:03:57.371 --> 01:04:00.071
I love this song.

872
01:04:03.351 --> 01:04:04.351
Nice.

873
01:04:05.111 --> 01:04:06.111
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I have to get on here.

874
01:04:12.371 --> 01:04:13.771
Come on, Julia. Party, girl!

875
01:04:14.491 --> 01:04:15.491
Right.

876
01:04:15.631 --> 01:04:16.631
Okay.

877
01:04:41.831 --> 01:04:42.831
Come on.

878
01:04:43.051 --> 01:04:43.451
Let's go.

879
01:04:43.711 --> 01:04:45.131
Don't even pretend that you're
poorer than Britney.

880
01:04:45.371 --> 01:04:46.751
I know you would've worked.

881
01:04:46.911 --> 01:04:47.911
Get up here.

882
01:04:52.031 --> 01:04:53.911
Come on.

883
01:05:07.871 --> 01:05:11.231
Guys. Guys. Guys, we have to go.

884
01:05:18.231 --> 01:05:21.251
Girls, get in! Get in, get in, get in!

885
01:05:21.375 --> 01:05:23.317
Leave everything! Run!
Come on, let's go!

886
01:05:23.841 --> 01:05:27.821
Mattie, let's go!
I'm so sorry, Cassie!

887
01:05:45.341 --> 01:05:46.341
God!

888
01:05:48.671 --> 01:05:50.571
So much for not needing a babysitter.

889
01:05:50.671 --> 01:05:52.371
Do you guys think of anybody 
but yourselves?

890
01:05:53.111 --> 01:05:55.151
You're so impulsive and entitled.

891
01:05:55.391 --> 01:05:56.031
And you don't listen.

892
01:05:56.231 --> 01:05:56.771
We didn't mean to...

893
01:05:56.971 --> 01:05:58.551
Whatever, don't even say anything.

894
01:05:59.591 --> 01:06:04.391
God, your futures were almost...
so different.

895
01:06:06.371 --> 01:06:07.951
You're lucky I saw them.

896
01:06:08.111 --> 01:06:08.431
I'm so sorry.

897
01:06:08.851 --> 01:06:09.851
Yes!

898
01:06:10.551 --> 01:06:13.431
You should be so sorry.
All of you should be sorry.

899
01:06:40.411 --> 01:06:41.791
Maria. Where did they go?

900
01:06:42.592 --> 01:06:43.592
I'm running checks now.

901
01:06:45.491 --> 01:06:47.371
I don't understand how they're doing this.

902
01:06:47.571 --> 01:06:49.331
I've got a match on the
woman that's with them.

903
01:06:49.631 --> 01:06:50.711
I'm not interested in her.

904
01:06:50.712 --> 01:06:53.051
Focus on finding those girls.

905
01:06:53.871 --> 01:06:57.111
Cassandra Webb, daughter
of Constance Webb, deceased.

906
01:06:57.951 --> 01:06:58.951
Did you say Webb?

907
01:07:00.131 --> 01:07:01.611
Uh, yeah. Do you know her?

908
01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:03.051
It's not possible.

909
01:07:06.051 --> 01:07:07.051
C'mon!

910
01:07:11.201 --> 01:07:13.122
He's not gonna stop until he 
kills us... is he?

911
01:07:14.421 --> 01:07:15.641
I don't know what he wants.

912
01:07:16.061 --> 01:07:17.341
I don't know anything.

913
01:07:19.221 --> 01:07:20.861
But...  you can see the future.

914
01:07:20.911 --> 01:07:23.801
Can't you stop him with your visions?

915
01:07:24.621 --> 01:07:26.201
I don't know how to control them.

916
01:07:27.301 --> 01:07:28.301
It's useless.

917
01:07:28.601 --> 01:07:30.121
I don't know why, maybe that's a plus.

918
01:07:30.681 --> 01:07:31.681
Is your hand okay?

919
01:07:33.301 --> 01:07:34.301
It's fine.

920
01:07:39.311 --> 01:07:41.352
First thing in the morning
I'm taking you all home.

921
01:07:41.911 --> 01:07:43.411
Your parents can deal with this.

922
01:07:44.491 --> 01:07:45.631
No, they can't.

923
01:07:50.051 --> 01:07:51.151
My mom's in a psych ward.

924
01:07:53.681 --> 01:07:55.357
She didn't really cope
well after my dad left,

925
01:07:55.381 --> 01:07:57.991
and so I got sent to live
with him and his new family,

926
01:07:58.151 --> 01:07:59.831
and I don't think that they want me there.

927
01:08:03.301 --> 01:08:04.891
I wondered if they missed me if...

928
01:08:06.471 --> 01:08:07.471
if I ran away.

929
01:08:08.841 --> 01:08:10.091
Hmm. So you did.

930
01:08:11.281 --> 01:08:12.562
My parents aren't around either.

931
01:08:13.271 --> 01:08:15.632
I think they resent how having
a kid messed up their lives.

932
01:08:16.441 --> 01:08:18.857
I don't think they're gonna fly
back from China to deal with this,

933
01:08:18.881 --> 01:08:22.512
and I really don't want to find
out, so... I'm on my own.

934
01:08:25.231 --> 01:08:29.392
Well, fine then. You guys
can just... Go to the police.

935
01:08:29.491 --> 01:08:30.491
No.

936
01:08:33.611 --> 01:08:36.011
My dad got deported six months ago.

937
01:08:37.371 --> 01:08:39.131
I came home from school when he was gone.

938
01:08:39.891 --> 01:08:40.891
What about your mom?

939
01:08:41.071 --> 01:08:42.192
My mom died when I was five.

940
01:08:43.651 --> 01:08:44.651
It's just me and my dad.

941
01:08:46.151 --> 01:08:47.937
Except he never told me
he didn't have his papers,

942
01:08:47.961 --> 01:08:50.991
so I've just been living by
myself in our apartment since then.

943
01:08:51.371 --> 01:08:52.371
You're on your own?

944
01:08:53.331 --> 01:08:55.871
I don't need anyone
else to look out for me.

945
01:08:57.851 --> 01:08:59.332
And I don't have a curfew either.

946
01:09:02.411 --> 01:09:04.051
So I can't go to the police.

947
01:09:04.951 --> 01:09:06.651
Okay? Until I'm 18.

948
01:09:07.471 --> 01:09:08.471
I can't exist.

949
01:09:09.721 --> 01:09:11.522
And there's no way I'm
getting deported, too.

950
01:09:11.831 --> 01:09:13.851
Or going into the foster system.

951
01:09:17.275 --> 01:09:18.575
Well...

952
01:09:19.371 --> 01:09:23.191
The foster system
isn't always that terrible.

953
01:09:25.041 --> 01:09:27.511
Things didn't turn out so bad for me.

954
01:09:27.711 --> 01:09:28.711
Right.

955
01:09:32.081 --> 01:09:34.561
Cassie, please help us.

956
01:11:53.621 --> 01:11:57.121
No one survives once enough
poison enters their system.

957
01:11:57.581 --> 01:11:59.221
You won't be so lucky next time.

958
01:12:00.321 --> 01:12:01.401
Why are you doing this?

959
01:12:02.261 --> 01:12:03.821
I need to stop them from killing me.

960
01:12:05.201 --> 01:12:06.381
They're not killers.

961
01:12:06.821 --> 01:12:07.821
They're just teenagers.

962
01:12:08.101 --> 01:12:10.221
In the future, I have done much more.

963
01:12:10.361 --> 01:12:12.941
In the future, they will destroy me.

964
01:12:13.201 --> 01:12:14.241
And everything I've built.

965
01:12:15.661 --> 01:12:17.321
Those girls cannot exist.

966
01:12:18.541 --> 01:12:19.801
How come you get to decide?

967
01:12:20.521 --> 01:12:22.061
Because I'm the one with the powers.

968
01:12:25.581 --> 01:12:29.521
If you knew what I know,
you'd do the same thing.

969
01:12:31.261 --> 01:12:35.601
Would I? If I  knew the price to
pay was the lives of three girls.

970
01:12:35.602 --> 01:12:38.341
The only thing I know
is that, in the future,

971
01:12:38.601 --> 01:12:39.601
They also have powers.

972
01:12:41.501 --> 01:12:42.501
The girls?

973
01:12:42.881 --> 01:12:44.941
The girls have the powers in the future.

974
01:12:45.261 --> 01:12:48.341
Did you think you can beat me
with your mind?

975
01:12:48.441 --> 01:12:50.061
Your mother underestimated me.

976
01:12:50.062 --> 01:12:51.541
<i>Mother underestimated me.</i>

977
01:12:51.721 --> 01:12:53.221
<i>The power of the spider.</i>

978
01:12:54.281 --> 01:12:55.941
Don't make the same mistake.

979
01:12:56.741 --> 01:12:57.941
Tell me where they are.

980
01:12:58.561 --> 01:13:00.201
They don't mean anything to you.

981
01:13:00.861 --> 01:13:01.861
You can just walk away.

982
01:13:22.891 --> 01:13:23.891
You never do.

983
01:14:03.456 --> 01:14:04.856
Rise and shine!

984
01:14:05.681 --> 01:14:10.791
Okay, so this guy's hands
somehow release an acute neurotoxin.

985
01:14:10.971 --> 01:14:12.251
And it is painful.

986
01:14:12.871 --> 01:14:16.871
I was lucky. The longer he holds onto
you, the more poison gets into your system.

987
01:14:17.221 --> 01:14:18.221
Then what happens?

988
01:14:19.461 --> 01:14:20.611
Then your heart stops.

989
01:14:22.341 --> 01:14:25.131
But you can offset cardiac arrest with CPR.

990
01:14:26.191 --> 01:14:28.951
So, you interlock your hands like this.

991
01:14:29.751 --> 01:14:30.751
You lock your elbows.

992
01:14:31.531 --> 01:14:34.831
And then you place the heel of
your hand right on the sternum.

993
01:14:35.331 --> 01:14:36.911
And then you pump.

994
01:14:37.371 --> 01:14:39.131
And you want to go like two inches down.

995
01:14:39.751 --> 01:14:41.632
And you want to keep a
rhythm like a heartbeat.

996
01:14:43.331 --> 01:14:43.691
You ready?

997
01:14:43.692 --> 01:14:46.611
Okay, begin compressions. Go. Good.

998
01:14:49.011 --> 01:14:49.611
And when do I
stop? You don't stop.

999
01:14:49.891 --> 01:14:51.651
If you stop, they die.

1000
01:14:52.291 --> 01:14:55.251
If you get tired, then you
need somebody to take over.

1001
01:14:56.251 --> 01:14:57.251
I'm tired.

1002
01:14:57.491 --> 01:14:59.311
Okay, Anya, get ready to take over.

1003
01:14:59.511 --> 01:15:01.971
But you have to pick up
the exact same rhythm.

1004
01:15:02.491 --> 01:15:03.491
Ready? Yeah.

1005
01:15:03.771 --> 01:15:03.911
And go.

1006
01:15:07.631 --> 01:15:08.531
Great.

1007
01:15:08.611 --> 01:15:09.611
Nice, Matty.

1008
01:15:09.635 --> 01:15:11.635
Not cool.

1009
01:15:14.551 --> 01:15:15.711
Julie, you want to
take over? Okay.

1010
01:15:15.931 --> 01:15:16.931
Get ready.

1011
01:15:19.071 --> 01:15:20.071
Okay.

1012
01:15:20.101 --> 01:15:21.751
One, two, three.
Perfect.

1013
01:15:22.631 --> 01:15:23.631
Nice job, Anya.

1014
01:15:26.401 --> 01:15:30.331
I've never said this before in my
entire life, but you're a good teacher.

1015
01:15:32.851 --> 01:15:36.231
Well, I've been learning some
things, too...

1016
01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:39.901
About my mom.

1017
01:15:46.631 --> 01:15:47.831
Wait, so you do know this guy?

1018
01:15:48.311 --> 01:15:50.631
My mom did, I think. That's her.

1019
01:15:51.591 --> 01:15:52.591
She's really pretty.

1020
01:15:57.051 --> 01:15:58.301
So this is because of you?

1021
01:16:01.141 --> 01:16:03.841
All I know is that she
was researching spiders.

1022
01:16:04.991 --> 01:16:08.081
In her notebook, there's
some stuff about a local

1023
01:16:08.093 --> 01:16:10.941
tribe in Peru that can
do, like, crazy stuff.

1024
01:16:11.401 --> 01:16:12.801
What kind of crazy stuff?

1025
01:16:14.921 --> 01:16:15.921
Climb like spiders.

1026
01:16:18.141 --> 01:16:20.361
So is he one of them?

1027
01:16:21.511 --> 01:16:22.521
I need more information.

1028
01:16:26.721 --> 01:16:27.721
You're leaving.

1029
01:16:31.821 --> 01:16:33.811
I have to go and figure
out what is going on.

1030
01:16:34.531 --> 01:16:35.531
How?

1031
01:16:38.511 --> 01:16:39.511
You have to go to Peru.

1032
01:16:43.261 --> 01:16:44.991
I'll be gone a week.
I don't want to leave them.

1033
01:16:44.992 --> 01:16:47.241
But he's out there looking
for them, and they're relying

1034
01:16:47.253 --> 01:16:49.232
on me, and I don't know
how else to protect them.

1035
01:16:49.681 --> 01:16:51.755
Okay. Look, I'm staying down
there for a few weeks over.

1036
01:16:51.767 --> 01:16:53.811
It's out of town. He
won't find them there.

1037
01:16:54.211 --> 01:16:57.315
But Cassie, I can't
pretend to understand

1038
01:16:57.327 --> 01:17:00.671
what's going on here.
Just be careful, okay?

1039
01:17:01.361 --> 01:17:04.491
I'll be back as soon as I can. Thank
you, Ben. You didn't ask for any of this.

1040
01:17:04.751 --> 01:17:05.951
Okay, well neither did you.

1041
01:18:52.091 --> 01:18:57.001
No, no, no, no.

1042
01:19:29.541 --> 01:19:32.141
You have come back. Looking for answers.

1043
01:19:36.666 --> 01:19:37.666
Back?

1044
01:19:37.691 --> 01:19:41.031
I promised your mother I would be here.

1045
01:19:43.361 --> 01:19:45.621
My mom thought Las Aranyas were a myth.

1046
01:19:46.061 --> 01:19:47.061
What do you think?

1047
01:19:47.101 --> 01:19:49.261
I think she's crazy for coming here alone.

1048
01:19:49.961 --> 01:19:52.661
She came here hoping
to extract healing properties

1049
01:19:52.673 --> 01:19:55.601
from the spiders. She thought
she was being protected.

1050
01:19:56.301 --> 01:19:57.301
By Ezekiel Sims?

1051
01:19:57.561 --> 01:20:00.579
His motives were selfish.
He used your mom to find

1052
01:20:00.591 --> 01:20:03.681
us. But because he stole
the spider, he was cursed.

1053
01:20:04.811 --> 01:20:07.521
He's been trying to outrun
his destiny ever since.

1054
01:20:14.601 --> 01:20:15.951
This is where my mom died?

1055
01:20:17.031 --> 01:20:18.211
And where you were born.

1056
01:20:23.981 --> 01:20:27.341
I don't understand why she
risked my life to come here.

1057
01:20:28.241 --> 01:20:32.181
To see your future clearly, you
have to heal the wounds of your past.

1058
01:20:32.721 --> 01:20:36.021
That sounds like literally every
therapy session I've ever avoided.

1059
01:20:36.321 --> 01:20:39.201
You have to go back to your
beginning and keep going past that.

1060
01:20:39.202 --> 01:20:42.581
There are powers...
You don't even know you're capable of.

1061
01:20:43.701 --> 01:20:46.261
Your thread did not start
when you were born.

1062
01:20:50.551 --> 01:20:51.551
Do you trust me?

1063
01:20:53.921 --> 01:20:56.342
I'm not really sure at this
point if I have a choice...

1064
01:21:03.731 --> 01:21:05.731
<i>You need to just walk away.</i>

1065
01:21:06.071 --> 01:21:08.351
Your threat did not start
when you were born.

1066
01:21:12.091 --> 01:21:14.711
She really is trying her best
to keep me from working.

1067
01:21:15.191 --> 01:21:17.751
Not when I was close, but when
I'm not going to let her do that.

1068
01:21:17.971 --> 01:21:19.751
Why did you hate me so much? 
Thank you.

1069
01:21:20.171 --> 01:21:21.171
<i>For the umbrella.</i>

1070
01:21:22.891 --> 01:21:24.031
<i>Give it to me.</i>

1071
01:21:25.171 --> 01:21:26.171
<i>I found it!</i>

1072
01:21:26.491 --> 01:21:27.491
<i>I found the spider!</i>

1073
01:21:28.031 --> 01:21:29.031
<i>Incredible, isn't it?</i>

1074
01:21:31.211 --> 01:21:32.451
Give it to me.

1075
01:21:32.691 --> 01:21:33.931
No, please...
Give it to me.

1076
01:21:34.132 --> 01:21:35.211
You're making the wrong decision...
Give it to me!

1077
01:21:35.251 --> 01:21:36.491
You could just walk away!

1078
01:21:36.831 --> 01:21:38.371
Ah!

1079
01:21:50.251 --> 01:21:51.251
I'm sorry.

1080
01:21:51.531 --> 01:21:52.531
I'm sorry.

1081
01:21:52.811 --> 01:21:53.811
I'm so sorry.

1082
01:21:54.351 --> 01:21:55.351
I'm so sorry.

1083
01:21:57.091 --> 01:21:59.191
Las Aranyas could not stand by.

1084
01:21:59.971 --> 01:22:01.951
We tried to save you both.

1085
01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:23.821
Her journey will not be
easy, but she is strong.

1086
01:22:32.971 --> 01:22:35.231
Your test results came back.

1087
01:22:35.271 --> 01:22:38.231
I'm sorry to tell you that
your baby has <i>Myestenia gravis</i>.

1088
01:22:38.751 --> 01:22:41.611
It's a genetic neuro-muscular disorder.

1089
01:22:42.031 --> 01:22:43.651
But I don't have a neuro-muscular disorder.

1090
01:22:43.671 --> 01:22:44.911
Life expectancy? It varies.

1091
01:22:46.391 --> 01:22:47.551
Do you need a tissue?

1092
01:22:48.011 --> 01:22:48.311
No.

1093
01:22:48.711 --> 01:22:49.651
No, I need a cure.

1094
01:22:49.652 --> 01:22:51.951
I'm afraid there is no cure.

1095
01:22:52.571 --> 01:22:54.731
A single target nucleotide intervention.

1096
01:22:55.111 --> 01:22:58.811
It's experimental, but there are
some promising leads in the Amazon.

1097
01:22:59.351 --> 01:23:00.411
That's why you want that?

1098
01:23:01.231 --> 01:23:02.231
For me?

1099
01:23:02.451 --> 01:23:04.411
I have to advise you against traveling.

1100
01:23:04.971 --> 01:23:05.391
I'm sorry.

1101
01:23:05.891 --> 01:23:07.891
What are you offering besides tissues?

1102
01:23:08.131 --> 01:23:09.851
I know this is hard to accept.

1103
01:23:09.931 --> 01:23:10.931
No, no.

1104
01:23:11.011 --> 01:23:15.831
I'm unwilling to accept a
diagnosis of helplessness.

1105
01:23:16.361 --> 01:23:18.551
And I'm not going to teach
my daughter to, either.

1106
01:23:27.796 --> 01:23:28.796
You did it.

1107
01:23:30.821 --> 01:23:32.051
You did it.

1108
01:23:33.351 --> 01:23:34.971
I never knew I was sick.

1109
01:23:35.551 --> 01:23:37.931
The spider venom did
have healing properties.

1110
01:23:41.051 --> 01:23:43.291
I'm so sorry I spent so long
being mad at you.

1111
01:24:26.961 --> 01:24:29.521
I always thought my mom 
didn't care about me.

1112
01:24:30.701 --> 01:24:33.281
Sometimes you must sacrifice
yourself for those you love.

1113
01:24:37.696 --> 01:24:38.411
I was there.

1114
01:24:38.651 --> 01:24:39.651
I was in the room.

1115
01:24:40.596 --> 01:24:41.731
I was in the room with her.

1116
01:24:41.791 --> 01:24:42.791
How did you do that?

1117
01:24:43.431 --> 01:24:44.631
You did that.

1118
01:24:44.811 --> 01:24:47.191
Now you're starting to
see what you're capable of.

1119
01:24:47.531 --> 01:24:50.111
You came here to learn
the truth about your past.

1120
01:24:51.381 --> 01:24:53.291
You will leave ready to embrace your future.

1121
01:24:55.261 --> 01:24:57.851
Seeing into the future
is no match for Ezekiel.

1122
01:24:58.431 --> 01:25:01.031
I need to stop him
before he kills those girls.

1123
01:25:01.231 --> 01:25:02.851
But I can't do what he can do.

1124
01:25:03.011 --> 01:25:06.951
I can't do the leapy, crawly, 
like... death poison.

1125
01:25:06.952 --> 01:25:10.051
You didn't get the gift
of the greater physical

1126
01:25:10.052 --> 01:25:12.231
strength or the ability
to release poison.

1127
01:25:13.191 --> 01:25:16.831
But seeing into the
future is only the start.

1128
01:25:17.031 --> 01:25:19.291
Your mind has infinite potential.

1129
01:25:19.941 --> 01:25:21.171
If you master your power,

1130
01:25:22.041 --> 01:25:25.751
you can use the web to be in more
than one place at the same time.

1131
01:25:26.761 --> 01:25:29.731
You are the only one
who can change the future.

1132
01:25:30.951 --> 01:25:37.231
And when you take on the responsibility,
great power will come.

1133
01:25:53.266 --> 01:25:55.066
Every day that goes by...

1134
01:25:55.191 --> 01:25:57.271
My appointment with death gets closer.

1135
01:25:58.751 --> 01:26:00.251
And you still have found nothing?

1136
01:26:01.091 --> 01:26:03.911
How can she get three teenagers
hidden for a week?

1137
01:26:04.351 --> 01:26:06.131
I'm running checks every three minutes,

1138
01:26:06.291 --> 01:26:07.911
scanning CCTV camera.

1139
01:26:08.191 --> 01:26:10.671
I hacked police and
emergency services frequencies.

1140
01:26:10.691 --> 01:26:12.171
I have eyes on all of their houses,

1141
01:26:12.791 --> 01:26:14.151
including friends and family.

1142
01:26:16.406 --> 01:26:17.406
Still nothing.

1143
01:26:17.771 --> 01:26:18.991
Do you understand?

1144
01:26:22.101 --> 01:26:23.551
Those girls cannot exist.

1145
01:26:24.091 --> 01:26:25.751
They will try to destroy me,

1146
01:26:26.011 --> 01:26:28.191
as I will you if you don't find them.

1147
01:26:29.971 --> 01:26:31.551
She can't hide them forever.

1148
01:26:35.941 --> 01:26:38.691
Okay, it's still pretty quiet out there.

1149
01:26:39.171 --> 01:26:40.511
What did I miss? Ben said words.

1150
01:26:40.471 --> 01:26:41.471
Oh, boring.

1151
01:26:41.971 --> 01:26:45.291
Okay, let's try and remember to pick up
after ourselves... ok, guys?

1152
01:26:45.315 --> 01:26:48.715
Hey, woah, woah, woah, woah.
Throwing popcorn is superfun, but...

1153
01:26:48.751 --> 01:26:54.371
Guys, guys, either I peed
myself or my water broke.

1154
01:26:56.531 --> 01:26:57.451
Ew.

1155
01:26:57.631 --> 01:27:00.811
Well, honestly, you probably peed yourself
because that isn't supposed to happen yet.

1156
01:27:01.051 --> 01:27:04.651
Richard's not here, and the
baby isn't due for four weeks.

1157
01:27:04.951 --> 01:27:06.631
I don't think the baby got the medal, Ben.

1158
01:27:06.751 --> 01:27:07.931
Okay, okay, okay.

1159
01:27:08.571 --> 01:27:13.251
Looks like we may have to wait a
little while for the... WOW. Ambulance.

1160
01:27:13.252 --> 01:27:15.591
The baby is not waiting.

1161
01:27:15.871 --> 01:27:16.871
He's coming.

1162
01:27:17.611 --> 01:27:18.611
Now, now.

1163
01:27:19.571 --> 01:27:21.431
Uh, like here, in the dining room?

1164
01:27:22.051 --> 01:27:24.491
If Ben doesn't get me
to the hospital, then yes.

1165
01:27:24.831 --> 01:27:28.911
Okay, uh, uh, get in the car.

1166
01:27:32.135 --> 01:27:33.335
Keep your head down.

1167
01:27:37.159 --> 01:27:39.159
It's gonna be ok.

1168
01:27:45.491 --> 01:27:47.871
Okay. Seatbelts, everybody.

1169
01:27:48.491 --> 01:27:49.491
Seriously? Let's go.

1170
01:27:50.571 --> 01:27:51.371
Uh, never mind.

1171
01:28:16.981 --> 01:28:18.301
We may have something.

1172
01:28:26.191 --> 01:28:27.791
I've intercepted a call to the hospital.

1173
01:28:28.331 --> 01:28:29.331
Same time it is.

1174
01:28:29.391 --> 01:28:30.391
Track the route.

1175
01:28:30.451 --> 01:28:31.451
Tracking.

1176
01:28:49.551 --> 01:28:50.551
Yeah.

1177
01:29:09.991 --> 01:29:11.872
Is this the... Hospital, Ben.

1178
01:29:12.051 --> 01:29:14.451
Get off me, get off me, get off me!

1179
01:29:16.811 --> 01:29:17.811
Shit!

1180
01:29:29.291 --> 01:29:30.391
Sorry, guys.

1181
01:29:39.001 --> 01:29:40.001
Thank you!

1182
01:29:45.891 --> 01:29:51.919
So the last one was 3 minutes and 24
seconds after the previous one, so that

1183
01:29:51.931 --> 01:29:57.971
means the time between contractions
is increasing at a rate of 21.6 seconds.

1184
01:29:58.871 --> 01:30:00.311
That was pretty fast.

1185
01:30:01.551 --> 01:30:04.031
You better hurry up, I'm not
sticking around if it gets gross.

1186
01:30:04.351 --> 01:30:06.031
It's the southwest on Vernon Avenue.

1187
01:30:06.511 --> 01:30:08.671
I'll cut them off on the
second avenue intersection.

1188
01:30:09.631 --> 01:30:10.631
Drive faster!

1189
01:30:10.711 --> 01:30:12.051
Let's go, let's go, please.

1190
01:30:21.131 --> 01:30:22.631
Hack into traffic control.

1191
01:30:23.611 --> 01:30:24.691
Turn the lights green.

1192
01:30:26.871 --> 01:30:27.871
Amaria, now.

1193
01:30:28.231 --> 01:30:29.931
Turning all traffic lights to green.

1194
01:30:32.711 --> 01:30:34.171
Why is no one stopping on red?

1195
01:30:34.691 --> 01:30:36.551
Hey, watch out!

1196
01:30:37.211 --> 01:30:38.771
They're not stopping!

1197
01:30:39.151 --> 01:30:40.151
Whoa, whoa!

1198
01:30:44.351 --> 01:30:45.511
Everyone okay? Yeah.

1199
01:30:45.951 --> 01:30:46.171
Yeah.

1200
01:30:46.591 --> 01:30:47.071
Are you okay?

1201
01:30:47.471 --> 01:30:48.471
Yeah.

1202
01:30:53.031 --> 01:30:55.191
Um... What is that?

1203
01:30:59.011 --> 01:31:00.451
Oh my god, it's him.

1204
01:31:01.551 --> 01:31:02.551
Guys?

1205
01:31:14.731 --> 01:31:16.791
Go, go, go!
Everybody get outta here right now!

1206
01:31:48.991 --> 01:31:52.871
Get out, go on! Get in the ambulance,
go! It's not over, go!

1207
01:31:53.152 --> 01:31:56.631
Ben, I need you to get Mary
as far away as possible, okay?

1208
01:31:56.651 --> 01:31:58.211
Ezekiel, he won't care about you now.

1209
01:31:58.431 --> 01:31:59.431
What about you?

1210
01:31:59.971 --> 01:32:02.031
I liked you better when
you didn't make plans!

1211
01:32:24.971 --> 01:32:25.971
You're showing off!

1212
01:32:27.131 --> 01:32:28.131
Not yet.

1213
01:32:28.411 --> 01:32:29.891
Uh, I think we lost him.

1214
01:32:35.612 --> 01:32:37.092
Get in the back and charge that AED.

1215
01:32:37.911 --> 01:32:39.171
For what?
Just do it, go.

1216
01:32:41.351 --> 01:32:42.811
Okay, press charge.

1217
01:32:43.635 --> 01:32:45.235
Am I having a heart attack?

1218
01:32:45.611 --> 01:32:47.411
I think I'm having a heart attack.

1219
01:32:47.435 --> 01:32:49.435
You're not having a heart attack.

1220
01:32:50.071 --> 01:32:51.791
Okay, get ready.

1221
01:32:53.091 --> 01:32:56.611
Get it close to the ceiling, nobody
touch the sides or anything.

1222
01:32:58.576 --> 01:33:00.076
Ready...?

1223
01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:04.900
Wait... wait...

1224
01:33:05.024 --> 01:33:06.224
Now!

1225
01:33:13.776 --> 01:33:14.976
Sorry!

1226
01:33:16.901 --> 01:33:17.901
You're okay?

1227
01:33:20.396 --> 01:33:21.396
Okay.

1228
01:33:21.821 --> 01:33:23.221
Now you're showing off.

1229
01:33:24.261 --> 01:33:25.261
Maybe a little.

1230
01:33:56.631 --> 01:33:57.951
<i>Those girls can not exist.</i>

1231
01:33:59.711 --> 01:34:00.711
<i>Infinite potential.</i>

1232
01:34:02.091 --> 01:34:03.531
<i>This place was always a death trap.</i>

1233
01:34:04.991 --> 01:34:05.991
Get down!

1234
01:34:08.011 --> 01:34:09.151
Go, run!

1235
01:34:10.475 --> 01:34:12.875
Go, come on! 
Get in the helicopter!

1236
01:34:20.141 --> 01:34:26.241
I have a code 30, PD 36307, requesting
airlift support, dockside, Queens.

1237
01:34:29.516 --> 01:34:30.516
Ok...

1238
01:34:34.541 --> 01:34:35.821
It's gonna get a little crazy.

1239
01:34:35.881 --> 01:34:36.881
It's already crazy.

1240
01:34:37.501 --> 01:34:38.501
You didn't bail on us.

1241
01:34:39.861 --> 01:34:42.641
Whatever happens, I promise
I'm going to protect you guys.

1242
01:34:42.921 --> 01:34:43.961
We'll protect each other.

1243
01:34:44.441 --> 01:34:45.441
We'll run this together.

1244
01:34:46.441 --> 01:34:47.441
Right?

1245
01:34:47.681 --> 01:34:48.681
Yeah.

1246
01:34:50.121 --> 01:34:52.041
Okay, we are still not doing high five.

1247
01:34:52.441 --> 01:34:53.961
I know, it's not cool.

1248
01:34:54.262 --> 01:34:55.721
Let's go, now go back.

1249
01:34:56.181 --> 01:34:57.181
All right, go, go, go.

1250
01:35:07.801 --> 01:35:09.061
This doesn't look safe.

1251
01:35:09.621 --> 01:35:12.481
Well, it's full of explosives
and it's structurally unsound.

1252
01:35:12.641 --> 01:35:13.761
Yeah, it doesn't sound safe.

1253
01:35:14.481 --> 01:35:15.481
It's a death trap.

1254
01:35:16.881 --> 01:35:17.881
That's a good thing?

1255
01:35:18.401 --> 01:35:20.361
As long as we're not
the ones who get trapped.

1256
01:35:21.661 --> 01:35:24.361
No matter what happens,
we need to work together.

1257
01:35:24.985 --> 01:35:26.185
Ok?

1258
01:35:26.901 --> 01:35:28.401
Well, his name is time, Cassie.

1259
01:35:29.121 --> 01:35:30.501
Yeah, and we won't be impulsive.

1260
01:35:31.461 --> 01:35:32.461
Are we ready?

1261
01:35:37.881 --> 01:35:38.961
We have to get to the roof.

1262
01:35:39.461 --> 01:35:40.661
He's gonna be here any minute.

1263
01:35:40.881 --> 01:35:42.541
Here, take these.

1264
01:35:43.241 --> 01:35:45.061
Put them in as many crates as you can.

1265
01:35:50.191 --> 01:35:51.191
Okay.

1266
01:35:52.091 --> 01:35:53.531
You two, go that way.

1267
01:35:54.011 --> 01:35:55.251
We need to slow him down.

1268
01:35:56.191 --> 01:35:58.091
Mattie, this way.
You come with me, come on.

1269
01:36:02.971 --> 01:36:04.191
Come this way.

1270
01:36:05.315 --> 01:36:06.515
Come on, Julia! Let's go!

1271
01:36:19.331 --> 01:36:20.671
Anya, go!

1272
01:36:24.395 --> 01:36:25.395
Go!

1273
01:36:36.619 --> 01:36:39.119
Go straight ahead! When I say now,
Get down!

1274
01:36:43.443 --> 01:36:45.443
What do you mean?
It's a dead end!

1275
01:36:48.167 --> 01:36:49.467
Now!

1276
01:36:53.191 --> 01:36:55.131
Wow. Go! Go!

1277
01:36:56.455 --> 01:36:57.855
Now you're really showing off!

1278
01:36:57.879 --> 01:36:59.879
Come on! Upstairs!

1279
01:37:11.042 --> 01:37:12.782
I knew! I knew she had a plan!

1280
01:37:12.971 --> 01:37:16.271
Hey! Right here! Right here!

1281
01:37:18.295 --> 01:37:20.295
<i>Make your way to the south side!</i>

1282
01:37:23.319 --> 01:37:24.519
Come on!

1283
01:37:26.643 --> 01:37:28.243
Wait, get down!

1284
01:37:30.367 --> 01:37:33.067
Oh, dear!
He said south side, we can go this way!

1285
01:37:34.291 --> 01:37:35.291
Anya!

1286
01:37:44.515 --> 01:37:45.515
Let's go!

1287
01:37:46.239 --> 01:37:47.239
Mattie!

1288
01:37:54.063 --> 01:37:55.263
We need to go this way.

1289
01:37:55.287 --> 01:37:57.287
Come on, Anya! Get down!

1290
01:37:59.311 --> 01:38:01.311
Go for the ladder! Let's go!

1291
01:38:03.135 --> 01:38:05.135
Come on, come on!

1292
01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:25.100
Get to the helicopter!

1293
01:38:25.124 --> 01:38:27.124
Hey! Hello!
Get down!

1294
01:38:29.948 --> 01:38:31.948
<i>It's not safe to land!
You have to get higher!</i>

1295
01:38:32.972 --> 01:38:35.272
Guys, this way!
We can get to the chopper from here!

1296
01:38:40.596 --> 01:38:41.996
Anya, jump!

1297
01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:44.620
Jump, now!

1298
01:38:44.644 --> 01:38:45.844
Julia, get back!

1299
01:38:52.368 --> 01:38:54.368
Julia, get down!

1300
01:39:05.992 --> 01:39:07.092
Oh, god!

1301
01:39:08.416 --> 01:39:09.916
You should have walked away!

1302
01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:13.240
You can't protect them!

1303
01:39:13.264 --> 01:39:14.464
Cassie!

1304
01:39:19.288 --> 01:39:20.688
Over here, asshole!

1305
01:39:23.512 --> 01:39:24.712
Mattie!

1306
01:39:43.881 --> 01:39:44.961
Anya!

1307
01:39:48.561 --> 01:39:50.201
Cassie!

1308
01:40:06.561 --> 01:40:10.561
You can't stay all three.

1309
01:40:10.562 --> 01:40:18.181
<i>And when you take on the responsability,
great power will come.</i>

1310
01:40:22.105 --> 01:40:24.105
Julia! I got you.

1311
01:40:24.129 --> 01:40:25.317
Come on.

1312
01:40:26.841 --> 01:40:29.121
Mattie!
You're gonna be okay.

1313
01:40:29.145 --> 01:40:31.145
Anya!
Honey, give me your hand.

1314
01:41:02.481 --> 01:41:04.581
You still can't beat me with your mind.

1315
01:41:08.031 --> 01:41:09.731
What makes you so sure?

1316
01:41:16.455 --> 01:41:18.455
Come on. Come on, come on.

1317
01:41:18.779 --> 01:41:19.979
You're just like your mother.

1318
01:41:20.403 --> 01:41:21.703
Yes. I am.

1319
01:41:44.451 --> 01:41:46.651
You've been trying to change your future...

1320
01:41:48.275 --> 01:41:50.575
But the girls were never your future.

1321
01:41:51.899 --> 01:41:53.099
I was.

1322
01:42:31.123 --> 01:42:33.423
No! Cassie!

1323
01:43:26.447 --> 01:43:28.147
She's not breathing!

1324
01:43:28.171 --> 01:43:29.171
Her heart is not beating!

1325
01:43:29.171 --> 01:43:30.347
We know what to do!

1326
01:43:30.571 --> 01:43:31.771
Beggining compressions!

1327
01:43:32.295 --> 01:43:33.595
Interlock your fingers.

1328
01:43:33.819 --> 01:43:35.219
Come back, Cassie!

1329
01:43:35.243 --> 01:43:36.543
Come on guys, come on!

1330
01:43:37.467 --> 01:43:38.667
We keep going, we don't stop!

1331
01:43:40.391 --> 01:43:41.891
Come on, Cassie...

1332
01:43:42.415 --> 01:43:43.815
I'm getting a little tired...

1333
01:43:44.039 --> 01:43:46.039
I'm right here.

1334
01:43:46.063 --> 01:43:48.563
Cassie, wake up...
Cassie! Come back, Cassie!

1335
01:43:50.351 --> 01:43:51.791
We're here, Cassie.

1336
01:43:51.871 --> 01:43:52.871
We're not leaving you.

1337
01:43:53.295 --> 01:43:55.295
Please come back, I need you...

1338
01:43:57.119 --> 01:43:59.119
Oh, my god!

1339
01:43:59.943 --> 01:44:00.943
Cassie!

1340
01:44:02.767 --> 01:44:04.767
Oh my god, we did it!

1341
01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:41.400
He's perfect!

1342
01:44:41.624 --> 01:44:43.824
He is.
He is perfect.

1343
01:44:52.448 --> 01:44:54.448
We're still here, Cassie.

1344
01:44:54.472 --> 01:44:56.472
We're not leaving you.

1345
01:44:57.351 --> 01:44:59.911
I wouldn't be here if I
weren't for the three of you.

1346
01:45:00.331 --> 01:45:01.331
Right back at you.

1347
01:45:02.361 --> 01:45:04.711
And so the title of the baby
is doing really well.

1348
01:45:05.511 --> 01:45:06.631
He's loving being an uncle.

1349
01:45:07.376 --> 01:45:10.291
Yeah, all the fun and
none of the responsibility.

1350
01:45:12.181 --> 01:45:13.181
That's what he thinks.

1351
01:45:16.701 --> 01:45:18.411
Are you all immediate family?

1352
01:45:19.431 --> 01:45:20.431
Yes.

1353
01:45:21.511 --> 01:45:22.511
They're all mine.

1354
01:45:30.201 --> 01:45:31.201
Can I get you anything?

1355
01:45:31.761 --> 01:45:32.761
No.

1356
01:45:33.661 --> 01:45:35.341
I have everything I need right here.

1357
01:46:09.621 --> 01:46:12.891
You left your junk mail downstairs...
Again.

1358
01:46:13.271 --> 01:46:15.331
And we got take-out.

1359
01:46:15.851 --> 01:46:17.891
We didn't know...
Kung-Pow chicken is perfect.

1360
01:46:18.031 --> 01:46:19.031
How did you know?

1361
01:46:20.091 --> 01:46:21.091
Bless you, Anya.

1362
01:46:21.331 --> 01:46:22.331
What?

1363
01:46:24.351 --> 01:46:25.351
Thank you.

1364
01:46:29.871 --> 01:46:30.291
Maddie!

1365
01:46:30.811 --> 01:46:31.111
What?

1366
01:46:31.511 --> 01:46:32.511
I told you I'm starving.

1367
01:46:33.171 --> 01:46:34.451
And I told you guys, that you won't...

1368
01:46:34.452 --> 01:46:36.511
We wouldn't like you if you're hangry.

1369
01:46:36.512 --> 01:46:39.511
Well, you wouldn't, so...

1370
01:46:39.911 --> 01:46:40.911
How's your eyesight?

1371
01:46:41.101 --> 01:46:42.791
I can see better than I ever have.

1372
01:46:43.131 --> 01:46:44.131
Oh, yeah?

1373
01:46:44.531 --> 01:46:46.611
Can you see us in the future?

1374
01:46:47.491 --> 01:46:48.491
Yes.

1375
01:46:49.851 --> 01:46:51.031
I can see you.

1376
01:46:52.811 --> 01:46:54.411
Standing up for what you believe.

1377
01:47:00.051 --> 01:47:01.431
Never giving up.

1378
01:47:06.851 --> 01:47:10.491
Discovering you were always
more powerful than you thought.

1379
01:47:11.791 --> 01:47:13.151
Nothing I didn't already know.

1380
01:47:16.031 --> 01:47:18.511
I don't know about you two, but...

1381
01:47:19.411 --> 01:47:20.651
That totally makes sense to me.

1382
01:47:21.231 --> 01:47:22.231
What? I'm serious.

1383
01:47:22.771 --> 01:47:23.771
Wow.

1384
01:47:25.311 --> 01:47:26.751
Wow, I'm being serious.

1385
01:47:42.491 --> 01:47:44.441
Whatever the future holds.

1386
01:47:49.621 --> 01:47:50.621
We'll be ready.

1387
01:47:53.261 --> 01:47:55.461
And you know the best
thing about the future...

1388
01:47:57.361 --> 01:47:58.641
It hasn't happened yet.
