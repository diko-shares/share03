348
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:05.960
FOR THE TIME BEING, YES.

349
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.080
THE CHILD NEEDS
PROTECTION.

<i>Mia: FOR 15 YEARS</i>

352
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.400
TO TELL ME THAT
MY FATHER IS A ROYAL?

353
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.680
I THOUGHT I WAS DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

354
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.520
OH, THE RIGHT THING
FOR WHO, MOM?

355
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.240
FOR ALL OF US.

356
00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.680
<i>I MEAN, IF WE</i>
<i>SECRETLY DIVORCED,</i>

357
00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.520
<i>HE WOULD BE ABLE</i>
<i>TO FIND A WOMAN</i>

358
00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.960
WHO WOULD STAY BY HIS SIDE
IN GENOVIA AND PRODUCE HEIRS,

359
00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.920
AND I WOULD BE FREE
TO LIVE MY LIFE WITH YOU.

360
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.360

WE MET IN COLLEGE!

361
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.760
I WAS YOUNG!
I--I WANTED TO PAINT.

362
00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.680

ONE STEP BEHIND SOMEONE

363
00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.240
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE?

364
00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.960
I MEAN, WITH RULES
AND REGULATIONS

365
00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.360
AND THE WAVING AND THE BOWING
AND THE SCRAPING?

366
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.040
I MEAN, I WAS SCARED!

367
00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.200
WELL, LIVING
WITH A MOTHER

368
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.600

370
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.680
I'M GOING
TO STRAIGHTEN UP

371
00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.160

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.160
<i>Helen: AFTER THE DIVORCE,</i>

374
00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.600
<i>BOTH AGREED</i>
<i>TO KEEP THAT DISTANCE</i>

375

381
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.200
I DON'T FEEL PROTECTED.

382
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.520
YOU TRY LIVING
FOR 15 YEARS

THINKING THAT
YOU'RE ONE PERSON,

384

YOU FIND OUT

385

THAT YOU'RE A PRINCESS.

386
00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.960

I'VE NEVER RIDDEN
IN A LIMO...

400
00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.040
HE ADMITTED BITTERLY
TO HIMSELF

401
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.160
AS HE CROSSED
TO THE OPEN WINDOW

402
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.360
AND LOOKED OUT AT THE BAY,
THE FOG LOOMING

403
00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.280
LIKE HIS PATHETIC LIFE
BEFORE HIM.

404
00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.360
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I WON AN EMMY.

405
00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.160
I HAVE THIS FAVORITE

HELEN, IF AMELIA REFUSES
TO ACCEPT THE THRONE,

412
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.520
THEN GENOVIA WILL CEASE
TO EXIST AS WE KNOW IT.

SO THE FUTURE
OF YOUR COUNTRY

OF MY 15-YEAR-OLD?

FOR THIS FAMILY.

EXCUSE ME,

451
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.120
I DON'T HAVE A FAMILY
WITH EITHER ONE OF YOU

452
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.640
BECAUSE YOU IGNORED ME
FOR 15 YEARS

453
00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.240
AND YOU LIED TO ME.

454
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.200

STUFF LIKE THAT

455
00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.520

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:54.880
I'M MEETING WITH
THE PRESS IN AN HOUR

1878
01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:56.200

1879
01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.760
YOU CAN COME IN NOW.

1880

IF I MAY SAY SO,

1881
01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:15.760
THAT DID NOT
GO VERY WELL.

1882
01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.960
IS THIS THE WAY
A PRINCESS SHOULD ACT?

1883
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.360
MY INFORMATION TELLS ME
THAT BOY WAS USING HER.

1884
01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:23.800
THE KISS WAS
MERELY A DEVICE

1885
01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:26.720
SO THAT HE COULD GET
HIS 15 MINUTES OF FAME.

1886
01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:28.000
AND HER FRIENDS
DIDN'T HELP, EITHER.

BANDANA, MONTANA...

WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

1889
01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.360
WHY DIDN'T SHE HAVE
ENOUGH COMMON SENSE

1890
01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:36.800
TO DEAL WITH THIS?

1891
01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.320
SHE'S ONLY 15...

1892
01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:41.200
BUT TODAY, SHE ACTED
BEYOND HER YEARS.

1893
01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:43.840
SHE SHOWED GREAT RESPECT

1894
01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:45.480
AND GRACEFULLY ACCEPTED
YOUR CRITICISM.

1895
01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:48.720
YOU'RE SAYING THAT AS A QUEEN,
I WAS TOO HARSH ON HER.

1896
01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:51.360
I WAS CRITICAL
OF THE PERSON

1897

2054
01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:55.720
DOC SAID THAT HE FIXED

TO GIVE HIM A CALL.

2056

REALLY GREAT OF YOU.

2066
01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:17.800
I DIDN'T DO IT FOR YOU.
DOC LETS THE BAND PRACTICE.

2067
01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:19.360
RIGHT. OF COURSE.

2068
01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:20.480
I HELP WITH THE CARS.

2069

OH, NO, HONEY, I'M SORRY.

2143
01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:07.720
I WAS IN A VERY
IMPORTANT MEETING.

2144
01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:09.880

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:32.360
IT WAS FOUND
AMONG HIS POSSESSIONS.

2149
01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:35.400

<i>ABOUT THE BEACH INCIDENT.</i>

2160
01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:02.680
IT WAS JUDGEMENTAL OF ME.

2161
01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:05.880
I DIDN'T PAUSE
TO VERIFY THE FACTS.

2162
01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:07.640
THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
GRANDMA.

2163
01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:10.880
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT IT A GREAT DEAL,

2164
01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:12.000
AND THE TRUTH IS,

2165
01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:15.320
I THINK YOU'D MAKE
A VERY FINE PRINCESS.

2166
01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:17.040
<i>YOU KNOW, PEOPLE THINK</i>

2167

<i>PRINCESSES ARE SUPPOSED</i>
<i>TO WEAR TIARAS,</i>

<i>AND LIVE</i>
<i>HAPPILY EVER AFTER,</i>

2170
01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:25.760
BUT IT'S SO MUCH MORE
THAN THAT.

2171
01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:28.000
IT'S A REAL JOB.

2172
01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:37.040
YOU ARE AN EXTRAORDINARY
PERSON, GRANDMA...

2173
01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:39.720
BUT I DON'T THINK
I'M MEANT TO DO THIS.

2174
01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:43.560
I WOULD BE SO AFRAID

2175
01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:47.040
THAT I WOULD DISAPPOINT
THE PEOPLE OF GENOVIA

2176
01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:49.000
AND I COULDN'T BEAR

2177
01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:52.480
TO DISAPPOINT YOU AGAIN.

2178
01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:57.480
WELL, AS I SAID,

2179
01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:00.000
I HAVE FAITH IN YOU.

2180
01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:05.880
I'M A WRITER.

2181
01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.080

2185
01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:14.480
NO. NO, NO.

2186
01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:16.480
IT'S A BIG HIT.

2187
01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:17.920
I WROTE A CHARACTER

2188
01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:19.160

2189
01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.920
I'M NOT A SPY.

2190
01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:23.600

THE CHARACTER SAID.

2191
01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:26.080

CONSIDERING MY HISTORY

2202
01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:51.600
IT WOULD BE BETTER

MY GRANDDAUGHTER HAS ARRIVED.

AS TO HER WARDROBE, I'M SURE.

BUT I'M NOT SO AFRAID
ANYMORE.

2426
01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:20.720
MY FATHER HELPED ME.

2427
01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:23.240
EARLIER THIS EVENING,
I HAD EVERY INTENTION

2428
01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:27.720
OF GIVING UP MY CLAIM
TO THE THRONE...

2429
01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:34.600
AND MY MOTHER HELPED ME
BY TELLING ME THAT IT WAS OK

2430
01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:39.680
AND BY SUPPORTING ME LIKE
SHE HAS FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE.

2431
01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:42.360
BUT...

2432
01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:44.760
THEN I WONDERED HOW I'D FEEL

2433
01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:47.800
AFTER ABDICATING MY ROLE
AS PRINCESS OF GENOVIA.

2434
01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:51.240
WOULD I FEEL RELIEVED
OR WOULD I FEEL SAD?

2435
01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:54.280
AND THEN I REALIZED...

2436
01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:58.840
HOW MANY STUPID TIMES A DAY
I USE THE WORD "I."

2437
01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:01.680
<i>IN FACT,</i>
<i>PROBABLY ALL I EVER DO</i>

2438
01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:03.120
IS THINK ABOUT MYSELF.

2439
01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:04.720
AND HOW LAME IS THAT

2440
01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:06.480
WHEN THERE ARE 7 BILLION
OTHER PEOPLE ON THE PLANET--

2441
01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:08.200
AHEM.

2442
01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:11.320
DID--OOH. SORRY.
I'M GOING TOO FAST.

2443
01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:14.560
<i>BUT THEN I THOUGHT...</i>

2444
01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:17.480
IF I CARED ABOUT
THE OTHER 7 BILLION OUT THERE

2445
01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:20.120
INSTEAD OF JUST ME...

2446
01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:22.800
THAT'S PROBABLY
A MUCH BETTER USE OF MY TIME.

2447
01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:28.880
<i>SEE, IF I WERE</i>
<i>PRINCESS OF GENOVIA,</i>

2448
01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:30.680
THEN MY THOUGHTS

2449
01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:34.480
AND THE THOUGHTS OF PEOPLE
SMARTER THAN ME...

2450
01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:38.480
<i>WOULD BE MUCH BETTER HEARD</i>
<i>AND JUST MAYBE...</i>

2451
01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:41.720
THOSE THOUGHTS COULD BE
TURNED INTO ACTIONS.

2452
01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:46.720

2453

01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:58.920
