she'll be with you in a moment.

No.

He was the Crown Prince of Genovia.

Uh-huh. You're joking.

Why would I joke about
something like that?

No. No, 'cause if he's
really a prince, then I'm...

235
00:14:02.916 --> 00:14:06.003
Your Majesty, in America
it doesn't always mean "be quiet."

- HERE IT COULD MEAN "WOW", "GEE WHIZ:..

Why on earth would you
pick me to be your princess?

Since your father died, you are
the natural heir to the throne of Genovia.

You are royal by blood.

is to be invisible

and I'm good at it.

250
00:14:53.967 --> 00:14:56.887
Amelia, I had other expectations, also.

251
00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:59.973
In my wildest dreams, I never
expected this to happen,

252
00:15:00.349 --> 00:15:04.186
but you are the legal heir,
the only heir to the Genovian throne

253

of helping you

254
00:15:06.647 --> 00:15:08.732
become the princess that you are.

I can teach you to walk, talk,
sit, stand, eat, dress like a princess.

in Genovia a very pleasant place to live.

I'm the head of your security and you want
me to be a chauffeur and a babysitter?

For the time being, yes.
The child needs protection.

find a spare minute

273
00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.262
to tell me that my father is a royal?

274
00:16:20.512 --> 00:16:22.723
- I thought I was doing the right thing.
- Oh.

275
00:16:22.806 --> 00:16:25.976
- The right thing for who, Mom?
- All of us.

276
00:16:26.185 --> 00:16:30.022
I mean, if we secretly divorced,
he would be able to find a woman

277
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.691
who'd stay by his side in Genovia
and produce heirs.

278
00:16:32.774 --> 00:16:35.152
And I'd be free to live my life with you.

I mean, please, we met in college.

280
00:16:37.446 --> 00:16:40.866
I was young. I wanted to paint.

Can you see me walking one step
behind someone for the rest of my life?

282

I mean, with rules and regulations,

283
00:16:46.705 --> 00:16:49.708
and the waving and the bowing
and the scraping, I was scared.

284
00:16:49.791 --> 00:16:53.170

for 15 years scares me.

we all discussed it.

288
00:17:03.096 --> 00:17:07.184
Your father and your grandmother
both agreed to keep their distance,

289
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:09.603
so you would have a chance
of a normal childhood.

He was so full of <i>joie de vivre,</i>
always laughing and smiling.

I remember.

Helen, if Amelia refuses
to accept the throne,

315
00:18:33.353 --> 00:18:36.523
then Genovia will cease to exist
as we know it.

we have an annual ball.

338
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:04.820
I was... I am hoping

339
00:20:05.028 --> 00:20:08.532
that I may present you to the press
and the public on that occasion.

340
00:20:08.865 --> 00:20:11.785
However, you desperately need
some instruction.

341
00:20:11.993 --> 00:20:15.997
I speak for the entire Genovian parliament
and the royal family.

342
00:20:16.206 --> 00:20:18.041
And I speak for this family.

343
00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.753
Excuse me. I don't have a family
with either one of you,

344
00:20:21.837 --> 00:20:26.383
because you ignored me for 15 years
and you lied to me.

345
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:29.761
Families don't do stuff like that
to one another, OK?

346
00:20:33.014 --> 00:20:35.559
- Where is she going?
- The tower.

347
00:20:36.893 --> 00:20:40.897
- Mia, you can't run from everything.
- She has a tower?

Please, just come down from there.

349
00:20:44.693 --> 00:20:48.572

for their 16th birthday, not a country.

350
00:20:50.073 --> 00:20:51.783

Talk to me.

353
00:20:58.832 --> 00:20:59.934
I can't talk to you right now,

354
00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:01.918
I'm late for a meeting
with my guidance counselor.

355
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.880
I'm late for a meeting
with Spain and Portugal.

356

357
00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:12.053
Mia promises to attend princess lessons
until your ball.

358
00:21:12.429 --> 00:21:17.225
It's not my ball, it's Genovia's
Annual Independence Day Ball.

359
00:21:17.517 --> 00:21:18.935
I'm sorry.

360
00:21:19.561 --> 00:21:22.147
Mia promises neither to accept nor reject

361
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:25.692
your offer to be royal
until this grand ball.

362
00:21:25.942 --> 00:21:28.069
And then she makes her decision.

363
00:21:28.403 --> 00:21:30.071
Now can you both live with that?

364
00:21:39.122 --> 00:21:40.499

until that evening, is that understood?

and Portugal waiting.

371

I'm gonna be 16 this year,

372
00:21:58.558 --> 00:22:01.978
and my mom traded two paintings
to get me a 1966 Mustang.

373

- You do know what a Mustang is, right?
- I raise mustangs.

374
00:22:04.981 --> 00:22:07.067
That is not a sensible car
for a princess.

375
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:10.153
Well, you see, it's not really
a sensible car for anyone. It doesn't run.

376
00:22:10.529 --> 00:22:13.740

something to this vehicle.

And the truth is, I think you'd make
a very fine princess.

are supposed to wear tiaras,

to disappoint you again.

- No, no.

just like you once, he was a spy.

- it would be better if you did it?
- Amelia,

hit the windshield, would you?

1811
01:43:15.639 --> 01:43:19.768
If I cared about the other seven billion
out there, instead of just me,

1812
01:43:21.394 --> 01:43:23.814
that's probably
a much better use of my time.

1813
01:43:25.732 --> 01:43:29.528
See, if I were Princess of Genovia,

1814
01:43:29.611 --> 01:43:35.117
then my thoughts and the thoughts
of people smarter than me

1815
01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:39.121
would be much better heard
and just maybe,

1816
01:43:39.246 --> 01:43:42.415
those thoughts could be
turned into actions.

1817
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:47.546
So, this morning when I woke up,

1818
01:43:47.629 --> 01:43:50.632
I was Mia Thermopolis.

1819
01:43:50.924 --> 01:43:53.635
But now...

1820
01:43:56.012 --> 01:43:58.974
...I choose to be, forevermore...

1821
01:43:59.891 --> 01:44:04.396
...Amelia Mignonette Thermopolis
Renaldi,

1822
01:44:04.563 --> 01:44:07.607
Princess of Genovia.

01:44:08.441 --> 01:44:10.694
(APPLAUSE)

1824
01:44:19.244 --> 01:44:23.248
I hope you didn't order
your stationary yet.

1825
01:44:23.498 --> 01:44:25.834
This was my very first tiara.

1826
01:44:25.917 --> 01:44:29.546
I was rather fond of it.
I'm hoping you will be, too.

1827
01:44:30.714 --> 01:44:31.923
Oh.

1828
01:44:32.007 --> 01:44:35.260
Grandma, but you had it all ready.
How did you know I'd even be here?

1829
01:44:35.802 --> 01:44:40.265
Because I recognize the same spirit in you
as someone else I know.

1830
01:44:40.682 --> 01:44:41.975
Hmm? Who?

1831
01:44:43.351 --> 01:44:44.978
Me.

1832
01:44:46.104 --> 01:44:47.439
Ah-ha! You made it.

1833
01:44:47.522 --> 01:44:49.608
You bet your life,
you big, tall string bean.
