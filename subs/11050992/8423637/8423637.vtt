1
00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:40.802
Mom.

2
00:01:50.078 --> 00:01:51.579
The wreath fell again.

3
00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:55.583
Okay. I thought
I saw something.

4
00:01:57.384 --> 00:01:58.385
Okay.

5
00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:01.488
What are you reading?

6
00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:06.159
Green Lantern.

7
00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:09.262
It's Earth's branch of the
intergalactic police force.

8
00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.032
Makes things
happen with his mind.

9
00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:15.637
Well, his ring.
But it's mostly his mind.

10
00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:19.206
Yeah.

11
00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:22.110
Maybe they
should write a comic

12
00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:23.745
about a middle-aged
Louisville nurse

13
00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:27.447
whose pheromones cause
men to lose their minds.

14
00:02:28.016 --> 00:02:29.216
I'd read that.

15
00:02:29.951 --> 00:02:31.284
What? Humor me.

16
00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:34.354
The level to which I humor
you is already off the charts.

17
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.394
Please just eat your toast.

18
00:02:45.232 --> 00:02:46.668
All right, we
should take your temp.

19
00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:48.402
This isn't a cartoon.

20
00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:50.672
My temperature doesn't
go up when I get mad.

21
00:02:52.073 --> 00:02:53.273
You're mad?

22
00:03:10.792 --> 00:03:14.327
I can't,
can't keep this up.

23
00:03:15.963 --> 00:03:17.098
I know it's hard.

24
00:03:17.832 --> 00:03:23.336
We both just have to be
strong just until it breaks.

25
00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:27.608
Me or the blizzard?

26
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.755
You behave out there.

27
00:07:57.878 --> 00:08:00.181
So'd you ever start your
graphic novel thingy?

28
00:08:03.584 --> 00:08:06.087
Well, I sat down to draw it
and I was like, "Oh shit,

29
00:08:06.654 --> 00:08:08.990
I should probably come
up with a story first."

30
00:08:10.624 --> 00:08:13.627
A grand opening, grand closing.

31
00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:18.032
Well, I'm sure
you have some ideas.

32
00:08:19.467 --> 00:08:20.968
I wanna write something dark.

33
00:08:21.936 --> 00:08:27.441
Something karmic, but
engaging and hopeful, too.

34
00:08:27.508 --> 00:08:28.776
I, I don't know.

35
00:08:30.011 --> 00:08:31.078
Well, I could help.

36
00:08:37.952 --> 00:08:38.753
Hey!

37
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.956
I'll autograph one for
you when I'm done, okay?

38
00:08:43.324 --> 00:08:44.759
Just gimme some space.

39
00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:47.161
Okay.

40
00:08:51.032 --> 00:08:53.167
There is something you
could do that might help.

41
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:58.072
Tell me the worst
thing you've ever done.

42
00:08:59.774 --> 00:09:01.642
Well, that's a bit direct.

43
00:09:01.709 --> 00:09:02.877
Before you had me.

44
00:09:11.619 --> 00:09:14.455
I don't,

45
00:09:14.523 --> 00:09:17.058
I don't wanna tell you.

46
00:09:19.927 --> 00:09:21.962
Wouldn't be that
useful if you did.

47
00:09:26.467 --> 00:09:27.635
Well...

48
00:09:30.738 --> 00:09:33.574
the people and the
places are a b-, a blur,

49
00:09:34.942 --> 00:09:35.943
but I remember

50
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.115
I was a bad person.

51
00:09:42.116 --> 00:09:44.218
You? Or the drugs?

52
00:09:45.252 --> 00:09:46.854
I'm glad that you can
make the distinction

53
00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:50.825
between the two,
but no, it was me.

54
00:09:55.396 --> 00:09:59.500
I, I enjoyed
corrupting innocence,

55
00:10:01.202 --> 00:10:05.473
mm, you know, giving them
a taste of the darkness

56
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.241
that flowed through my veins.

57
00:10:08.309 --> 00:10:10.778
It was, it was worse than
misery loving company.

58
00:10:10.845 --> 00:10:15.116
It was, it was chaos
making chaos for breakfast.

59
00:10:17.051 --> 00:10:18.119
Mm.

60
00:10:18.786 --> 00:10:22.990
20 years ago, right?
Ancient history.

61
00:10:23.257 --> 00:10:27.761
Mm. No, you don't just
click your heels and run...

62
00:10:28.329 --> 00:10:32.032
Have a pass waiting for
you like that in the dark.

63
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:36.670
Or outside the window.

64
00:10:40.975 --> 00:10:44.812
Mm, chaos making
chaos for breakfast.

65
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.318
The past is a bitch like that.

66
00:10:56.657 --> 00:10:58.292
At least you
didn't kill anybody.

67
00:11:00.995 --> 00:11:03.097
Not like you're
gonna kill me.

68
00:11:26.387 --> 00:11:28.155
That is not the most accurate.

69
00:11:28.289 --> 00:11:29.857
My asshole's frozen shut.

70
00:11:37.666 --> 00:11:39.300
I think I stacked
the dishes funny.

71
00:11:39.601 --> 00:11:41.101
Dry off. I'll be right back.

72
00:12:40.861 --> 00:12:42.796
Look at all the decorations.

73
00:12:42.863 --> 00:12:44.599
They have decorations. I
hope there's no kids here.

74
00:12:44.765 --> 00:12:45.866
What?

75
00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:46.900
Well, I don't
wanna freak them out.

76
00:12:46.967 --> 00:12:48.503
I don't wanna freak anybody out!

77
00:12:49.203 --> 00:12:50.104
Come here.

78
00:12:52.674 --> 00:12:53.575
Kory?

79
00:12:53.642 --> 00:12:54.908
-Yeah?
-This doesn't feel right.

80
00:12:54.975 --> 00:12:57.011
No, Lizzie,
it feels warm.

81
00:12:57.378 --> 00:12:58.379
Look, we need to go!

82
00:12:58.613 --> 00:12:59.648
Where?

83
00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:03.752
Run!

84
00:13:03.817 --> 00:13:04.918
Get out of my house!

85
00:13:12.926 --> 00:13:13.927
What the?

86
00:13:13.994 --> 00:13:16.665
-Stop! Stop!
-Wait! Wait!

87
00:13:16.964 --> 00:13:20.034
Okay, wait? Just
wait a second, okay?

88
00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:23.070
We're not here to hurt anybody.

89
00:13:23.137 --> 00:13:24.706
We, we just wanted
to get out of the cold.

90
00:13:24.773 --> 00:13:25.740
Bullshit!

91
00:13:25.806 --> 00:13:27.408
I'm sorry, okay?
This was a mistake.

92
00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:28.442
-Yeah!
-Yeah, I told you that

93
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.077
10 fucking minutes ago.

94
00:13:30.512 --> 00:13:32.946
I need a doctor. Hey, lady,
are you a nurse or something?

95
00:13:33.013 --> 00:13:35.583
No, and you need to get
the hell out of here now.

96
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:38.085
But ma'am, it
is freezing outside.

97
00:13:38.152 --> 00:13:39.654
I can't walk.
I'm fucking dying.

98
00:13:39.721 --> 00:13:40.988
You're not dying.

99
00:13:41.055 --> 00:13:42.990
You have to help me.
That's a rule, isn't it, right?

100
00:13:43.057 --> 00:13:44.825
It's like the, the, uh, what
is it, the Hippocratic Oath?

101
00:13:44.892 --> 00:13:46.193
-What are you-
-No, that's doctors.

102
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.494
Nurses take the
Nightingale Pledge.

103
00:13:47.562 --> 00:13:48.663
Oh, I'm sorry.

104
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.164
Hey, that doesn't cover
home fucking invasion.

105
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.965
Okay, we can debate
that while he bleeds

106
00:13:52.032 --> 00:13:53.033
all over your floor.

107
00:13:53.267 --> 00:13:55.469
There'll be more damages
than we meant to cause.

108
00:13:57.037 --> 00:13:59.973
Do you know what'll happen
if you send us out there?

109
00:14:00.809 --> 00:14:03.043
I'm not sure I'd be able
to live with myself.

110
00:14:04.011 --> 00:14:05.346
But your house, your call.

111
00:14:07.615 --> 00:14:09.116
Please, please.

112
00:14:09.584 --> 00:14:14.756
Dammit. Help me
get him to the couch.

113
00:14:15.155 --> 00:14:16.791
-Breathe, just breathe.
-Okay.

114
00:14:16.857 --> 00:14:17.759
-I'm breathing!
-Little faster.

115
00:14:17.826 --> 00:14:19.126
I think I'm hyperventilating.

116
00:14:19.193 --> 00:14:20.260
I'm gonna fucking pass out now.

117
00:14:20.327 --> 00:14:22.530
-Ow, fuck, come on!
-Ooh, sorry,

118
00:14:22.597 --> 00:14:25.132
-sorry, sorry!
-Ow! Oh, fuck.

119
00:14:26.701 --> 00:14:28.503
Ooh, okay, rags.

120
00:14:28.703 --> 00:14:29.704
-Huh?
-In the kitchen

121
00:14:29.771 --> 00:14:31.105
underneath the sink!

122
00:14:31.238 --> 00:14:34.174
Ah, okay, I'm ready.
Just, just, just yank it.

123
00:14:34.241 --> 00:14:35.909
Yeah, it's not
gonna be that simple.

124
00:14:36.243 --> 00:14:37.177
What?

125
00:14:41.014 --> 00:14:41.716
What is that?

126
00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.652
No, no, no, no, no
tools, no, no. It's okay.

127
00:14:44.719 --> 00:14:46.688
Trust me, this is the easy way.

128
00:14:47.254 --> 00:14:48.422
Uh, what do I do?

129
00:14:49.022 --> 00:14:51.024
Roll it up and
put it in his mouth.

130
00:14:51.325 --> 00:14:52.126
Okay.

131
00:14:52.226 --> 00:14:53.862
Hell of a time to
be out for a stroll.

132
00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:56.063
Blizzard's been full tilt
for the past six days.

133
00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.898
Yeah, I told her that this
little missionary trip

134
00:14:57.965 --> 00:14:58.932
could wait till spring.

135
00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:00.100
-This isn't-
-Well 'tis the season.

136
00:15:00.167 --> 00:15:02.637
All right.
Hold the bat still.

137
00:15:02.704 --> 00:15:04.037
There's gonna be
more blood coming.

138
00:15:04.839 --> 00:15:07.174
Here we go.

139
00:15:07.908 --> 00:15:09.042
All right.

140
00:15:11.011 --> 00:15:12.112
Oh, shit! Sorry!

141
00:15:12.179 --> 00:15:13.648
What the fuck, man?

142
00:15:13.748 --> 00:15:14.982
I'm sorry.

143
00:15:15.282 --> 00:15:18.085
I'm sorry. Are you ready

144
00:15:18.152 --> 00:15:18.986
No!

145
00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:30.297
-Okay.
-Just you here?

146
00:15:30.364 --> 00:15:33.133
I have a daughter.

147
00:15:34.334 --> 00:15:35.670
She has a fever.

148
00:15:37.171 --> 00:15:38.939
Is that her room at the door?

149
00:15:39.841 --> 00:15:42.276
She's not a basket
case or something?

150
00:15:47.047 --> 00:15:50.384
Apply pressure.
Do not leave this room.

151
00:16:16.511 --> 00:16:17.444
Charm?

152
00:16:36.865 --> 00:16:37.866
Charm.

153
00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:20.434
You hammer,
I'll see to his knee,

154
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.135
and we'll figure
out the rest later.

155
00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.757
Nice house. Must be
one heck of a nurse.

156
00:19:16.824 --> 00:19:18.026
I had a hospice patient.

157
00:19:18.325 --> 00:19:19.359
We worked together
for two years.

158
00:19:19.426 --> 00:19:20.327
I didn't think she
liked me very much,

159
00:19:20.394 --> 00:19:24.197
but she went, her will came,

160
00:19:24.264 --> 00:19:25.667
it was hers, and now it's mine.

161
00:19:28.036 --> 00:19:29.236
Thanks.

162
00:19:31.271 --> 00:19:32.807
Guest room.
It's yours for the night.

163
00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:39.647
Does that make you feel safe?

164
00:19:42.617 --> 00:19:46.253
Yeah, absolutely. What
makes you feel safe?

165
00:19:47.922 --> 00:19:49.924
Big bats with screws in them.

166
00:19:53.561 --> 00:19:56.196
So what's your daughter's deal?

167
00:19:57.865 --> 00:19:59.867
I told you. She has a fever.

168
00:20:00.034 --> 00:20:01.936
Yeah, it must be pretty bad.

169
00:20:02.003 --> 00:20:03.236
And all the metal.

170
00:20:04.172 --> 00:20:06.007
She's prone to
psychotic episodes.

171
00:20:06.074 --> 00:20:08.241
I'd insist that you stay away.

172
00:20:10.511 --> 00:20:12.714
You're the boss, Nightingale.

173
00:20:13.047 --> 00:20:14.247
Yeah.

174
00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:22.623
Thanks again.

175
00:20:26.928 --> 00:20:27.929
I heard voices.

176
00:20:29.329 --> 00:20:30.798
Are there really
people down there?

177
00:20:30.865 --> 00:20:33.034
Uh, yeah, they just,
they got caught in the storm,

178
00:20:33.101 --> 00:20:35.737
so it's just gonna
be for a few hours.

179
00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.740
I could get dressed, say hi.

180
00:20:39.339 --> 00:20:41.209
You know that's not a good idea.

181
00:20:41.609 --> 00:20:46.714
I just, I just wanna
talk to somebody.

182
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.684
Charm, these people, they're,
they're drifters, okay?

183
00:20:49.751 --> 00:20:51.451
The 8 ball they did in
the shelter's probably

184
00:20:51.519 --> 00:20:53.821
the only reason why
they're not frozen solid.

185
00:20:55.288 --> 00:20:56.490
You would know.

186
00:20:57.892 --> 00:20:58.893
I would fucking know!

187
00:21:03.631 --> 00:21:06.968
Can you just trust
me for once? Please?

188
00:21:22.049 --> 00:21:23.316
2.4 degrees.

189
00:21:24.585 --> 00:21:26.954
That's all that's keeping her
from slipping away from me.

190
00:21:27.889 --> 00:21:28.790
Again.

191
00:21:31.491 --> 00:21:35.029
I know addiction,
I know sickness,

192
00:21:37.031 --> 00:21:42.703
but what has Charm is
a biological nightmare,

193
00:21:44.972 --> 00:21:46.741
and I'm fighting it the
only way that I know how,

194
00:21:53.413 --> 00:21:56.349
but that, that safe
zone, that coveted window

195
00:21:57.218 --> 00:21:59.419
is getting harder and
harder to maintain.

196
00:22:03.724 --> 00:22:09.831
I'm so tired and my
sweet, sweet girl, she is

197
00:22:13.034 --> 00:22:14.135
running out of time.

198
00:22:45.766 --> 00:22:47.869
We got lucky.

199
00:22:48.302 --> 00:22:49.402
Wasn't luck.

200
00:22:49.604 --> 00:22:50.972
Yeah, no, I know it.

201
00:22:51.038 --> 00:22:52.472
I'm just, you know what I mean.

202
00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:55.375
You mean we found the house
at the end of the rainbow

203
00:22:55.442 --> 00:22:57.011
like the leprechaun
said we would?

204
00:22:57.545 --> 00:22:59.013
Oh, look under the cushion.

205
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.083
Maybe there's some gold coins
sprinkled about, laddie.

206
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:03.517
I get it already.

207
00:23:03.651 --> 00:23:05.219
And credit where it's due, huh?

208
00:23:05.286 --> 00:23:06.988
No, just saying

209
00:23:07.622 --> 00:23:10.224
that this is an extremely
fortunate situation.

210
00:23:10.457 --> 00:23:12.927
Found a nice warm
house with the power on

211
00:23:12.994 --> 00:23:17.464
and the hostess is a nurse among
other bucket-list fetishes.

212
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.433
That was a joke, Liz.

213
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.435
But I
tell you that anyone

214
00:23:22.503 --> 00:23:24.038
who looks at a woman lustfully

215
00:23:24.105 --> 00:23:27.508
has already committed adultery
with her in his heart.

216
00:23:28.109 --> 00:23:31.746
Liz, I'm not married.

217
00:23:35.082 --> 00:23:40.021
I'm sorry. I'm in your
corner no matter what.

218
00:23:41.689 --> 00:23:46.527
We just can't have
another misunderstanding.

219
00:23:48.729 --> 00:23:49.764
Okay.

220
00:23:50.197 --> 00:23:51.198
Not now.

221
00:23:57.805 --> 00:23:59.874
So what are you
looking for exactly?

222
00:24:00.308 --> 00:24:01.474
Intracranial hemorrhaging.

223
00:24:01.642 --> 00:24:04.078
It's a possible side effect
from a prolonged fever.

224
00:24:05.546 --> 00:24:07.214
So brain damage.

225
00:24:08.582 --> 00:24:10.051
It's just a precaution.

226
00:24:10.318 --> 00:24:13.554
Heavy recovery from any
medication has a mini withdrawal

227
00:24:13.821 --> 00:24:15.556
Psychosis is a possibility.

228
00:24:15.623 --> 00:24:16.991
Auditory and visual
hallucinations,

229
00:24:17.058 --> 00:24:21.028
lucid sleepwalking,
but you'll be fine.

230
00:24:26.033 --> 00:24:31.572
When you said you made mistakes
before, was I one of them?

231
00:24:37.712 --> 00:24:39.547
I've made mistakes before you,

232
00:24:40.581 --> 00:24:43.150
after you, with you,

233
00:24:46.354 --> 00:24:47.722
but never you.

234
00:24:51.425 --> 00:24:55.129
So who are they downstairs?

235
00:24:56.864 --> 00:25:01.502
Um, they're just some kids
who got caught in the storm.

236
00:25:01.902 --> 00:25:02.703
Kids?

237
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:04.972
Well, no, no, they're adults.

238
00:25:05.706 --> 00:25:06.807
Well, you just said kids.

239
00:25:06.874 --> 00:25:07.975
Okay, it's a figure of speech.

240
00:25:08.042 --> 00:25:09.577
Which is the exact
opposite of adults.

241
00:25:09.643 --> 00:25:10.311
Why are you pushing me?

242
00:25:10.378 --> 00:25:11.512
I'm not pushing you.

243
00:25:11.579 --> 00:25:13.080
I just wanna have some
normal interaction with-

244
00:25:13.147 --> 00:25:15.082
Well, you're not normal!

245
00:25:21.088 --> 00:25:23.758
You're more, Charm.

246
00:25:24.992 --> 00:25:25.893
You're more, okay?

247
00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.030
You're more than anyone
could ever understand.

248
00:25:30.464 --> 00:25:31.866
And what's happening right now

249
00:25:31.932 --> 00:25:34.802
leads away from logic
into pure phenomena,

250
00:25:35.836 --> 00:25:37.805
so it, it, it
doesn't make it easier.

251
00:25:37.872 --> 00:25:41.642
It makes it harder.

252
00:25:43.644 --> 00:25:47.681
I promise I won't
give up if you don't,

253
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:49.950
but you have to trust me.

254
00:25:59.226 --> 00:26:01.328
All right. Maybe a quick dinner.

255
00:26:06.133 --> 00:26:10.137
What are those? Those aren't
what you normally, um...

256
00:26:12.073 --> 00:26:14.041
Dinner or not, kiddo?

257
00:26:27.888 --> 00:26:30.691
Okay. Well, I will
leave the door unlocked.

258
00:26:30.758 --> 00:26:32.293
Come down in about 20 minutes.

259
00:27:34.688 --> 00:27:36.657
Oh, come on man. You're
gotta say something.

260
00:27:36.724 --> 00:27:38.726
She's gonna think you're
a fucking serial killer.

261
00:27:38.792 --> 00:27:42.129
Um, hey, going hiking?

262
00:27:48.802 --> 00:27:51.005
Who are you now?

263
00:27:51.172 --> 00:27:52.806
Our little home invader?

264
00:27:52.873 --> 00:27:55.009
Yeah. Yep, that's me, Kory.

265
00:27:55.075 --> 00:27:57.945
Sorry, um, uh, it, it, it, just,

266
00:27:58.012 --> 00:28:00.181
I'm not, I'm not
dangerous, okay.

267
00:28:00.381 --> 00:28:02.249
Said every serial killer ever.

268
00:28:02.316 --> 00:28:04.785
Okay, please, please
don't. Please don't scream.

269
00:28:04.852 --> 00:28:05.554
Liz will freak out and then-

270
00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:06.820
Liz?

271
00:28:06.887 --> 00:28:09.123
Yeah, that's my sister who
thinks she is my mother.

272
00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.325
You know, I love her,
I, I, it's just like,

273
00:28:11.392 --> 00:28:14.395
don't you wish people would
back the fuck off sometimes?

274
00:28:14.862 --> 00:28:18.165
All the time.
You coming out or what?

275
00:28:18.732 --> 00:28:22.069
Uh, I was sort of
thinking I'd stay here

276
00:28:22.136 --> 00:28:24.305
because, uh,
if you don't see me,

277
00:28:24.371 --> 00:28:27.676
then we got a little bit of,
uh, uh, plausible deniability,

278
00:28:27.741 --> 00:28:28.909
you know what I mean?

279
00:28:35.849 --> 00:28:39.286
So you're pretty
into porcupines, huh?

280
00:28:41.188 --> 00:28:42.156
I hate them.

281
00:28:42.624 --> 00:28:46.160
Oh, yeah, sure.
That explains the shrine.

282
00:28:46.628 --> 00:28:47.928
It's hard to exert
control over something

283
00:28:47.995 --> 00:28:50.197
when you're too
busy running from it.

284
00:28:50.632 --> 00:28:53.000
Sounds like you got
some adult concerns.

285
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.170
Yeah, I'm
juggling a few others.

286
00:28:56.337 --> 00:28:58.439
Oh, yeah. Like what?

287
00:29:00.241 --> 00:29:03.377
Like the effect antifreeze
has on one's innards.

288
00:29:08.249 --> 00:29:11.218
Did you know porcupine
means pig with swords?

289
00:29:11.352 --> 00:29:15.055
Did you know their quills
are basically calcified hair?

290
00:29:15.222 --> 00:29:16.290
I did not.

291
00:29:16.357 --> 00:29:18.259
And that at the right angle
they sink into the flesh,

292
00:29:18.325 --> 00:29:19.728
like hot rebar.

293
00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.997
How did
you find that out?

294
00:29:25.634 --> 00:29:26.834
The hard way.

295
00:29:29.704 --> 00:29:32.139
My mom had surprised me
with a trip to the zoo.

296
00:29:34.475 --> 00:29:35.776
Like always, she felt bad

297
00:29:35.843 --> 00:29:37.444
and thought this would
make everything okay.

298
00:29:41.115 --> 00:29:42.116
You wanna take it
outta my pocket?

299
00:29:42.182 --> 00:29:43.150
-Yeah, I do!
-But even then

300
00:29:43.217 --> 00:29:44.753
I could see
through her bullshit.

301
00:29:44.818 --> 00:29:46.521
Where is it, huh?
What you gonna do with it?

302
00:29:46.588 --> 00:29:48.723
What are you gonna do with
it? Better give it on back!

303
00:29:48.956 --> 00:29:50.958
-The look in her eye.
-Who you gonna sell it to?

304
00:29:51.058 --> 00:29:52.259
It was
more than hunger.

305
00:29:52.426 --> 00:29:56.163
It was, it scared me,

306
00:29:58.365 --> 00:29:59.133
so I ran.

307
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:07.542
There were people everywhere,
but no one helped.

308
00:30:15.349 --> 00:30:17.918
Ran through the first
door I could find,

309
00:30:21.255 --> 00:30:22.256
the wrong one.

310
00:30:22.923 --> 00:30:24.058
Mama, Mama, Mama.

311
00:30:24.124 --> 00:30:25.760
The smell hit me first.

312
00:30:26.795 --> 00:30:30.130
Then I, I saw it.

313
00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:40.207
Possession, negligence. They
arrested her on the spot.

314
00:30:41.041 --> 00:30:42.677
How long did they keep her?

315
00:30:43.043 --> 00:30:47.881
She kept herself. 7
rehab stints in 10 years.

316
00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:52.920
But, but she's, uh, she's all
better now, though, right?

317
00:30:52.986 --> 00:30:56.256
Like she's, uh,
rehabilitated or whatever.

318
00:30:58.058 --> 00:31:00.160
Part of recovering
is letting go.

319
00:31:02.429 --> 00:31:03.263
She has this old suitcase

320
00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:05.399
from her party days
out in the garage.

321
00:31:06.467 --> 00:31:07.267
Probably still something

322
00:31:07.334 --> 00:31:10.037
in there to make
all the pain go away.

323
00:31:11.271 --> 00:31:12.940
Guess all that shit with
your mom is the reason

324
00:31:13.006 --> 00:31:15.275
you got the whole tortured
artist thing going on, right?

325
00:31:15.342 --> 00:31:17.612
I mean, well,
I mean almost anyway, right?

326
00:31:17.679 --> 00:31:18.646
What do you mean?

327
00:31:18.747 --> 00:31:20.114
I don't know, I mean, um,

328
00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:23.618
no obsession is complete
without a cool origin story, so.

329
00:31:24.619 --> 00:31:27.555
Some battle scars might have
sold it better. That's all.

330
00:31:46.741 --> 00:31:48.375
Honey
are you coming down?

331
00:31:50.043 --> 00:31:51.412
Guess it's showtime.

332
00:31:51.478 --> 00:31:53.548
Yeah, yeah,
I guess I better, um...

333
00:31:53.615 --> 00:31:55.215
Escape?

334
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:58.686
No one's getting
out of this zoo.

335
00:32:21.375 --> 00:32:22.376
What? Okay.

336
00:32:25.979 --> 00:32:28.148
-Pass that.
-Oh, thank you.

337
00:32:28.282 --> 00:32:29.283
Thanks.

338
00:32:29.584 --> 00:32:30.585
Smells great, ma'am.

339
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:41.395
Hi, Charm. Uh, this is
Liz and that's Kory.

340
00:32:44.532 --> 00:32:48.503
Uh, we appreciate
your hospitality.

341
00:32:50.471 --> 00:32:51.739
We'll see.

342
00:32:55.976 --> 00:32:57.377
Uh, before we start eating,

343
00:32:57.444 --> 00:33:00.548
I would be honored to
lead us in a blessing.

344
00:33:00.615 --> 00:33:02.082
If we could all join hands?

345
00:33:08.422 --> 00:33:12.025
Heavenly Father, thank you
for leading us out of the cold

346
00:33:12.092 --> 00:33:14.796
and into the limitless
warmth of Your love.

347
00:33:15.195 --> 00:33:18.499
Please bless our food,
but especially our host,

348
00:33:18.867 --> 00:33:21.168
hostesses who have graced us

349
00:33:21.235 --> 00:33:23.505
with an all-too-rare compassion.

350
00:33:23.771 --> 00:33:25.840
In Your name, we say

351
00:33:25.907 --> 00:33:27.207
amen.

352
00:33:32.079 --> 00:33:33.347
Let's eat.

353
00:33:33.548 --> 00:33:36.350
So we're making tracks along
the road outside Shelby Bowl,

354
00:33:36.416 --> 00:33:37.719
and then the snow just
starts dumping on us.

355
00:33:37.785 --> 00:33:40.722
Mm-hmm, and we need shelter,
but we wanna keep moving.

356
00:33:40.788 --> 00:33:42.189
-Bus, right?
-Wrong.

357
00:33:42.256 --> 00:33:44.124
Some kind human
took it upon themselves

358
00:33:44.191 --> 00:33:46.326
to knock down every
stop marker for like-

359
00:33:46.393 --> 00:33:47.962
For like, it's
like two miles easy.

360
00:33:48.028 --> 00:33:49.196
So the buses are going by us

361
00:33:49.263 --> 00:33:50.532
and we're screaming
bloody murder.

362
00:33:50.598 --> 00:33:54.034
Yeah, for hours, so then
I gave up and I sat down-

363
00:33:54.101 --> 00:33:55.402
In the snow.

364
00:33:55.469 --> 00:33:56.436
And I cried.

365
00:33:56.504 --> 00:33:57.539
Yes, you did.

366
00:33:57.672 --> 00:34:00.374
Mm, why didn't you just pray

367
00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.677
for the limitless
warmth of His love?

368
00:34:07.782 --> 00:34:10.652
Uh, I did that, too.

369
00:34:10.718 --> 00:34:12.052
Well, help me understand.

370
00:34:12.119 --> 00:34:13.320
Like, maybe you can
explain it to me.

371
00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:17.357
So when you have food
right, you thank Him for it,

372
00:34:17.424 --> 00:34:20.895
but when you are trapped
in sub-zero temperatures,

373
00:34:20.962 --> 00:34:22.830
that's a sign, right?

374
00:34:23.565 --> 00:34:24.933
A sign of what?

375
00:34:25.098 --> 00:34:27.067
That God wants you
to freeze to death.

376
00:34:27.769 --> 00:34:31.673
I don't think God wants
anyone to freeze to death.

377
00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:37.411
I think God uses the cold
like a farmer would use

378
00:34:37.477 --> 00:34:41.481
an electric fence to steer
you to where you belong.

379
00:34:41.783 --> 00:34:44.519
Okay, so say God
steers you here

380
00:34:44.686 --> 00:34:47.822
and I send you right back out
the window that you came in,

381
00:34:48.455 --> 00:34:52.492
and then, you know,
something bad happens.

382
00:34:52.827 --> 00:34:54.127
Who's the guilty party?

383
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:56.330
The party that feels guilty.

384
00:34:57.532 --> 00:34:58.398
I don't know.

385
00:34:58.566 --> 00:35:00.635
Doesn't His plan kind of
give me an out, though?

386
00:35:00.902 --> 00:35:03.136
Like, no repercussions,
cause like, whatever I do,

387
00:35:03.203 --> 00:35:07.508
whatever happens,
it's His plan, right?

388
00:35:10.645 --> 00:35:13.113
Well, God...

389
00:35:13.347 --> 00:35:15.850
Have you ever heard
of the term PBAB?

390
00:35:16.985 --> 00:35:18.586
Pine box at bedside?

391
00:35:20.688 --> 00:35:24.025
Yeah, I've been a
nurse for 10 years now,

392
00:35:24.191 --> 00:35:25.392
and I've helped more
people evade death

393
00:35:25.459 --> 00:35:27.327
than you could even fathom,

394
00:35:27.562 --> 00:35:29.463
and it wasn't because I
waited for holy intervention

395
00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.198
or because I
trusted in the plan.

396
00:35:31.532 --> 00:35:34.334
I acted. The use of
science is an act.

397
00:35:34.769 --> 00:35:37.204
And the people who believe
in the myth to save them,

398
00:35:37.471 --> 00:35:40.508
they build those pine boxes
and the people who act,

399
00:35:40.708 --> 00:35:42.275
we keep them empty.

400
00:35:46.346 --> 00:35:49.917
I think one day
you're gonna wonder

401
00:35:49.984 --> 00:35:51.552
what else you are wrong about.

402
00:35:55.255 --> 00:35:56.423
Emerald twilight.

403
00:35:58.425 --> 00:35:59.027
What?

404
00:35:59.192 --> 00:36:02.195
Oh, Mom, you're gonna love this.

405
00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:05.298
Hal Jordan, Earth's
Green Lantern, uh,

406
00:36:05.365 --> 00:36:08.335
he comes back from this cosmic
ass-kicking marathon, right?

407
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:12.272
And he finds his home, Coast
City, completely annihilated.

408
00:36:12.607 --> 00:36:17.578
Everything he ever loved or
held dear is just a crater.

409
00:36:19.279 --> 00:36:23.818
So he's devastated
and he gets an idea.

410
00:36:25.485 --> 00:36:29.023
He uses his ring to
resurrect Coast City.

411
00:36:29.824 --> 00:36:32.960
All the buildings are back
and people stroll the streets,

412
00:36:34.028 --> 00:36:36.263
holding hands and
sharing embraces

413
00:36:36.329 --> 00:36:37.397
with the one who got away.

414
00:36:37.464 --> 00:36:39.399
He even spends time
with his dead mother

415
00:36:42.269 --> 00:36:43.838
till his ring runs out of power.

416
00:36:45.673 --> 00:36:47.008
So he shoots up into space to
get back to his home planet

417
00:36:47.075 --> 00:36:51.713
where their,
where their power source is,

418
00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:54.048
and he needs it.

419
00:36:54.716 --> 00:36:56.651
He needs all of it to
keep Coast City alive,

420
00:36:56.718 --> 00:36:58.853
but the, the Guardians
and the other Lanterns,

421
00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:02.990
they won't let him have it,
so he obliterates them all.

422
00:37:06.027 --> 00:37:07.028
Charm. Charm?

423
00:37:07.327 --> 00:37:10.631
No one feels guilty if
they're destroying something

424
00:37:10.698 --> 00:37:11.866
in order to build.

425
00:37:12.299 --> 00:37:18.438
Not God, not superheroes,
not fucking politicians.

426
00:37:24.011 --> 00:37:25.780
But I think we should.

427
00:37:26.214 --> 00:37:27.782
I, I think.

428
00:37:30.918 --> 00:37:32.186
Charm. Charm!

429
00:37:32.252 --> 00:37:33.755
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, Charm!

430
00:37:33.821 --> 00:37:35.656
Oh my god, this is a
seizure. What do we do?

431
00:37:35.723 --> 00:37:37.290
Can't just stand here.
We gotta do something.

432
00:37:37.357 --> 00:37:38.593
Help me lie her straight.

433
00:37:38.659 --> 00:37:39.927
No, you're supposed to put
something in her mouth.

434
00:37:39.994 --> 00:37:41.162
What, are you a doctor now?

435
00:37:41.229 --> 00:37:42.663
She's gonna fucking die, man!

436
00:37:44.498 --> 00:37:46.399
Shit. The power transfer switch.

437
00:37:46.466 --> 00:37:48.536
Oh great, the power transfer
switch. That's lovely.

438
00:37:48.603 --> 00:37:49.269
Calm down!

439
00:37:49.336 --> 00:37:50.671
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

440
00:37:50.738 --> 00:37:52.907
We can't see shit and there's
a girl dying on the floor.

441
00:37:52.974 --> 00:37:53.875
I apologize for losing my zen.

442
00:37:53.941 --> 00:37:54.776
-Okay.
-You, you have

443
00:37:54.842 --> 00:37:56.343
like a, a backup
generator or something?

444
00:37:56.409 --> 00:37:57.745
No, it should have kicked on.

445
00:37:57.812 --> 00:37:58.946
Flashlights?

446
00:38:00.413 --> 00:38:04.384
Yes, there is a backup jenny
in the corner of the garage.

447
00:38:05.153 --> 00:38:06.286
All right, you guys take these.

448
00:38:06.353 --> 00:38:06.988
Go turn the switch on.

449
00:38:07.088 --> 00:38:08.122
What, why us?

450
00:38:08.189 --> 00:38:09.289
We don't know anything
about generators.

451
00:38:09.356 --> 00:38:10.357
Because I need to be
here with my daughter.

452
00:38:10.423 --> 00:38:11.793
Um, okay, he, he, he's right.

453
00:38:11.859 --> 00:38:13.261
Okay, we don't know
what we're doing,

454
00:38:13.326 --> 00:38:15.696
so why don't you take him
and I'll stay with her.

455
00:38:19.934 --> 00:38:22.970
Okay, let's go.

456
00:38:23.204 --> 00:38:24.972
After this, team meeting.

457
00:38:29.342 --> 00:38:34.515
Uh, okay, just um,
stay there.

458
00:38:41.722 --> 00:38:43.257
S- so, uh, Charm's dad,

459
00:38:43.323 --> 00:38:45.425
is he, is he in the picture?

460
00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.762
I cut him out a long time ago.

461
00:38:48.196 --> 00:38:49.396
Doesn't stop him
from squirming in

462
00:38:49.462 --> 00:38:50.698
every now and then, but...

463
00:38:52.266 --> 00:38:56.637
Shit. Can you
give me some light?

464
00:38:57.238 --> 00:38:59.941
Uh-huh.

465
00:39:00.741 --> 00:39:03.110
You know, I think the
whole body positivity thing

466
00:39:03.177 --> 00:39:04.812
is super hot.

467
00:39:24.332 --> 00:39:28.102
Hello? Charm?

468
00:39:42.884 --> 00:39:43.885
Are you all right?

469
00:39:47.555 --> 00:39:49.456
Like, if you need help,

470
00:39:51.859 --> 00:39:55.963
if something's wrong,
like, really wrong,

471
00:39:58.633 --> 00:40:00.835
you just have to tell me.

472
00:41:14.241 --> 00:41:15.242
Charm?

473
00:41:22.049 --> 00:41:23.417
Help me, Mama.

474
00:41:23.818 --> 00:41:27.855
O- okay, just, just, just
wait a second! You guys!

475
00:41:39.499 --> 00:41:41.135
Team meeting, all right.

476
00:42:05.393 --> 00:42:06.627
Charm?

477
00:42:17.271 --> 00:42:21.776
Charm? Can you follow my voice?

478
00:42:23.344 --> 00:42:25.246
Can you follow my voice?

479
00:42:29.984 --> 00:42:34.588
I'll go as far as I can, but
you're gonna have to meet me.

480
00:42:37.725 --> 00:42:39.927
Charm, are you coming?

481
00:42:57.078 --> 00:43:00.714
Our Father Who art in
heaven, hallowed be Thy name.

482
00:43:00.781 --> 00:43:03.350
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

483
00:43:14.295 --> 00:43:15.296
Charm?

484
00:43:20.569 --> 00:43:21.769
Hello?

485
00:43:40.454 --> 00:43:42.456
Hurry, open this door!

486
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:44.725
Hurry, open the fucking door!

487
00:43:46.794 --> 00:43:48.929
Somebody open this door!

488
00:43:50.798 --> 00:43:51.932
We got you. Hey, hey.

489
00:43:51.999 --> 00:43:53.100
Oh no.

490
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:57.338
There is, there
is something out there.

491
00:43:57.404 --> 00:43:58.739
-What?
-Okay, maybe there is.

492
00:43:58.806 --> 00:44:01.642
There's a tunnel all the way
to your damn mailbox, okay?

493
00:44:01.709 --> 00:44:04.011
-Come here, come here.
-well, where's Charm?

494
00:44:04.845 --> 00:44:06.113
-Something was chasing me.
-Charm. Charm.

495
00:44:11.118 --> 00:44:12.086
Ice tunnel?

496
00:44:12.153 --> 00:44:14.088
Yes. Go look, I swear!

497
00:44:16.056 --> 00:44:17.091
What the fuck?

498
00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:32.306
Something is wrong here.
Have you been seeing things.

499
00:44:32.806 --> 00:44:33.941
With all the pills
I've been taking,

500
00:44:34.008 --> 00:44:35.376
I don't think I'm
seeing enough things.

501
00:44:35.442 --> 00:44:36.410
Look, I'm being serious!

502
00:44:36.477 --> 00:44:37.845
Yeah, and I'm
being logical, dude.

503
00:44:37.912 --> 00:44:41.650
Like, we're all tired and
hungry and fucking horny, okay?

504
00:44:41.715 --> 00:44:44.218
So I think some minor
freakouts are allowed.

505
00:44:46.353 --> 00:44:47.054
She drugged us.

506
00:44:47.121 --> 00:44:48.088
What?

507
00:44:48.155 --> 00:44:51.560
I was fine until we ate
and then, and then I, I,

508
00:44:51.626 --> 00:44:52.993
-I thought I saw.
-Oh, no, no, no.

509
00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:54.361
I ate the same thing you did.

510
00:44:54.596 --> 00:44:55.863
Maybe it's too
busy bouncing off

511
00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:57.398
all the other crap
in your system.

512
00:44:57.464 --> 00:44:58.633
Yeah, and maybe
it's like the time

513
00:44:58.699 --> 00:45:00.901
you saw St. Anthony
in the shower.

514
00:45:01.101 --> 00:45:02.803
Look, you want me to
concur with something?

515
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:05.973
I'll concur that Charm is a
few bats short of a belfry.

516
00:45:06.508 --> 00:45:09.109
Or is it too many bats?
It's too many bats, right?

517
00:45:10.077 --> 00:45:11.312
I think she's here
against her will.

518
00:45:12.413 --> 00:45:15.316
The, the seizures, the
door. It, it makes sense.

519
00:45:15.382 --> 00:45:16.283
No, it do-

520
00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:18.385
I, I talked to her, okay.

521
00:45:18.452 --> 00:45:21.956
She would've told me if she
was a, like a fucking hostage.

522
00:45:23.592 --> 00:45:25.926
It's my face. Makes
girls wanna open up.

523
00:45:25.993 --> 00:45:29.496
-Ugh.
-Don't. Hey, don't, okay?

524
00:45:30.231 --> 00:45:31.666
Your neurotic hunch
is gonna put us

525
00:45:31.732 --> 00:45:33.100
in a freeze-to-death situation.

526
00:45:33.167 --> 00:45:37.505
So you would ignore a
captive human to stay warm?

527
00:45:37.838 --> 00:45:40.040
I am disabled.

528
00:45:41.375 --> 00:45:46.847
Just get some
rest, okay, Nancy Drew?

529
00:45:47.147 --> 00:45:50.484
We're hitting the slopes
tomorrow, no skis.

530
00:45:53.187 --> 00:45:55.389
You know, when
they delivered you,

531
00:45:56.625 --> 00:46:00.629
both of your lungs collapsed,
and the umbilical cord

532
00:46:00.695 --> 00:46:02.263
wrapped around your
neck was not helping.

533
00:46:03.764 --> 00:46:05.199
You weighed two pounds.

534
00:46:06.467 --> 00:46:09.336
When they tried to check you
out in the corner of the room,

535
00:46:09.403 --> 00:46:10.505
the power died,

536
00:46:13.307 --> 00:46:15.376
and I didn't know
what was happening.

537
00:46:16.176 --> 00:46:18.580
You know, I was so
disoriented from the drugs,

538
00:46:18.647 --> 00:46:19.913
theirs and my own.

539
00:46:20.649 --> 00:46:21.616
I didn't know what was going on,

540
00:46:21.683 --> 00:46:23.150
but I could hear them talking

541
00:46:23.585 --> 00:46:26.153
and they were talking about
you like you were already dead.

542
00:46:27.321 --> 00:46:29.524
And I knew that I
couldn't be there for you,

543
00:46:31.091 --> 00:46:33.060
that you would have to
be your own battery,

544
00:46:33.127 --> 00:46:36.196
your own safety, your own charm,

545
00:46:38.633 --> 00:46:41.636
but this time, this time,

546
00:46:41.703 --> 00:46:43.772
I'm here to pull
you out of the dark.

547
00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:12.099
The substitute compound is
making her more aggressive.

548
00:47:12.966 --> 00:47:18.807
I might have to,
I might have to. Fuck!

549
00:47:24.144 --> 00:47:25.145
Fuck.

550
00:47:29.718 --> 00:47:30.618
Fuck.

551
00:48:11.291 --> 00:48:12.259
Hello.

552
00:48:13.427 --> 00:48:18.098
Uh, uh, fuck.

553
00:48:23.003 --> 00:48:24.672
Just leave you there.

554
00:48:25.774 --> 00:48:30.144
Um, um, um.

555
00:48:32.714 --> 00:48:34.582
Oh, Jesus, you're the man.

556
00:48:43.792 --> 00:48:45.192
What the fuck?

557
00:48:47.595 --> 00:48:49.163
Jesus Christ, Faith.

558
00:48:51.666 --> 00:48:52.667
What?

559
00:48:54.702 --> 00:48:56.704
Make the pain go away, my ass.

560
00:49:03.645 --> 00:49:04.411
Idiot.

561
00:49:18.392 --> 00:49:19.393
Mine now.

562
00:49:35.342 --> 00:49:36.310
Okay.

563
00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:41.749
Shit, I got it.

564
00:50:07.542 --> 00:50:10.912
Sorry.

565
00:50:51.686 --> 00:50:54.622
Some, uh,

566
00:50:54.689 --> 00:50:55.690
it's a crazy day, huh?

567
00:50:56.624 --> 00:50:59.393
Still early,
isn't it, buddy?

568
00:50:59.694 --> 00:51:02.931
Oh, oh, uh, you're, um.

569
00:51:03.297 --> 00:51:07.434
Charm's father,
man of the house. That's me.

570
00:51:08.468 --> 00:51:11.005
She didn't really, uh, she
didn't really mention you.

571
00:51:11.506 --> 00:51:15.610
Really? Sounds like
sour teenage grapes to me.

572
00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:18.111
Well, I wouldn't know

573
00:51:18.178 --> 00:51:19.847
I, um, I don't have any kids.

574
00:51:19.914 --> 00:51:21.683
Not yet,
but you got plenty

575
00:51:21.749 --> 00:51:25.019
of that pure white venom
just itching to get out.

576
00:51:25.085 --> 00:51:27.989
I can
smell it from here.

577
00:52:13.668 --> 00:52:16.169
You know, I never
apologized t-, um,

578
00:52:16.236 --> 00:52:18.706
to you for sort of
just dropping in here.

579
00:52:18.773 --> 00:52:19.741
So sorry.

580
00:52:30.852 --> 00:52:34.856
I should go back to bed. So,
um, sorry to wake you up here.

581
00:52:35.523 --> 00:52:36.490
Kory.

582
00:52:37.091 --> 00:52:40.227
Yeah?

583
00:52:43.564 --> 00:52:45.767
You've got
something of mine.

584
00:52:47.234 --> 00:52:49.436
I'm sorry. I, I wasn't gonna.

585
00:53:02.382 --> 00:53:03.818
Nighty-night.

586
00:53:11.458 --> 00:53:13.761
What the fuck?

587
00:53:18.032 --> 00:53:19.399
Don't go out there.

588
00:53:20.001 --> 00:53:21.169
I have to see her for myself.

589
00:53:21.234 --> 00:53:23.203
Trust me, hey. It's not safe.

590
00:53:23.437 --> 00:53:24.706
Well, maybe she's
not safe, either.

591
00:53:24.772 --> 00:53:26.339
Who fucking cares?

592
00:53:27.274 --> 00:53:29.342
That sickening lack of
empathy for your fellow man

593
00:53:29.409 --> 00:53:31.344
is gonna come for
you tenfold, brother,

594
00:53:31.445 --> 00:53:34.716
so do yourself a favour
and get with the program

595
00:53:35.083 --> 00:53:36.150
before it's too late.

596
00:53:36.216 --> 00:53:36.918
Move.

597
00:55:06.207 --> 00:55:07.542
Charm?

598
00:55:10.878 --> 00:55:13.881
It's me, Liz.

599
00:55:16.717 --> 00:55:18.753
Yeah, I know where you are.

600
00:55:19.587 --> 00:55:21.522
Come to stare at
the basket case?

601
00:55:24.759 --> 00:55:27.028
Old school. Nice.

602
00:55:29.931 --> 00:55:31.833
Literally been in
hundreds of those things,

603
00:55:31.899 --> 00:55:33.968
but I still don't
understand how they work.

604
00:55:35.102 --> 00:55:37.370
Photo chemicals are basically
popped like a pimple

605
00:55:37.437 --> 00:55:40.141
onto a positive sheet
when the exposure exits.

606
00:55:40.842 --> 00:55:43.044
After that,
what you see is what you get

607
00:55:45.445 --> 00:55:46.914
or what you thought you saw.

608
00:55:48.716 --> 00:55:52.820
Mystery solved.
I brought you these.

609
00:55:53.621 --> 00:55:59.660
Th- they're very striking.
Thought you might want them.

610
00:56:02.964 --> 00:56:03.965
Liz, right?

611
00:56:07.869 --> 00:56:12.073
Last time I checked, there's
only one copy of that key.

612
00:56:15.543 --> 00:56:17.111
I had to see for myself.

613
00:56:17.178 --> 00:56:18.411
See what for yourself?

614
00:56:18.746 --> 00:56:21.082
That you weren't
here against your will.

615
00:56:21.916 --> 00:56:26.554
The seizure, the door,
the, the, the tunnel.

616
00:56:28.856 --> 00:56:29.824
The tunnel.

617
00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:33.628
Take my picture.

618
00:56:39.567 --> 00:56:40.768
Your home is odd.

619
00:56:42.435 --> 00:56:44.071
I've been keeping my eyes open.

620
00:56:44.939 --> 00:56:47.474
Usually there'll
be a sign somewhere.

621
00:56:48.209 --> 00:56:51.612
You know, a trinket, a symbol.

622
00:56:52.246 --> 00:56:53.446
Some evidence of-

623
00:56:53.514 --> 00:56:54.348
Evidence of what?

624
00:57:01.889 --> 00:57:02.890
Faith.

625
00:57:04.125 --> 00:57:11.532
Hmm. Value judgements from
the home invader, hmm?

626
00:57:13.067 --> 00:57:14.201
I'm sorry. I just...

627
00:57:18.606 --> 00:57:20.708
I- is there something

628
00:57:21.676 --> 00:57:25.212
that you wanna tell me
about your mother?

629
00:57:27.748 --> 00:57:31.118
I've seen situations
like this before.

630
00:57:31.886 --> 00:57:34.922
This isn't how real
protection works.

631
00:57:37.692 --> 00:57:38.859
What's there to tell?

632
00:57:40.895 --> 00:57:42.563
My mom thinks I
turn into a monster

633
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:44.565
if I get too hot or too cold.

634
00:57:46.867 --> 00:57:47.835
Well, do you?

635
00:57:50.204 --> 00:57:51.806
Joking.

636
00:57:53.074 --> 00:57:58.379
I really, your mother seemed
to have this overdeveloped

637
00:57:58.446 --> 00:58:01.849
sense of duty when it
comes to your health.

638
00:58:03.217 --> 00:58:07.521
Sometimes people want us to
think that their transgressions

639
00:58:07.588 --> 00:58:09.757
are powered by passion.

640
00:58:11.659 --> 00:58:13.761
Then what's actually
in the tank, hmm?

641
00:58:14.729 --> 00:58:19.233
I don't know. Guilt, maybe.

642
00:58:19.667 --> 00:58:24.572
You two sure seem
fascinated by the G word.

643
00:58:25.339 --> 00:58:27.708
I just wish we agreed
on its functions.

644
00:58:28.943 --> 00:58:31.679
Guilt is a stain
bestowed upon people

645
00:58:31.746 --> 00:58:34.548
who make the wrong decisions.

646
00:58:35.649 --> 00:58:39.854
It's the whole point. It's
what separates us from beasts.

647
00:58:44.358 --> 00:58:48.295
So if I really am a monster,

648
00:58:49.563 --> 00:58:52.033
my mom shouldn't feel
guilty for locking me up,

649
00:58:53.801 --> 00:58:58.939
tranquilized like a beast?

650
00:59:01.809 --> 00:59:07.081
Charm, I've seen monsters.

651
00:59:09.283 --> 00:59:11.252
You're not one of them.

652
00:59:25.399 --> 00:59:26.333
Charm.

653
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.335
What you see is what you get.

654
00:59:44.118 --> 00:59:45.086
That's, that's enough.

655
01:00:03.704 --> 01:00:04.905
Charm!

656
01:00:22.189 --> 01:00:26.627
Charm!

657
01:00:53.454 --> 01:00:55.456
Hey, I don't know
what just happened.

658
01:00:55.990 --> 01:01:00.694
You don't have to tell me. But,
um, we obviously have to go.

659
01:01:13.642 --> 01:01:15.176
I don't know what
the fuck that is.

660
01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:16.611
Look.

661
01:01:23.717 --> 01:01:24.818
Listen, we're gonna get,

662
01:01:24.885 --> 01:01:26.187
we're gonna get some blankets

663
01:01:26.253 --> 01:01:28.189
and then we're gonna steal
some food and then we go out

664
01:01:28.255 --> 01:01:30.592
the way we came in and we
just move faster than shit.

665
01:01:30.858 --> 01:01:34.461
I can't. We can't.

666
01:01:34.695 --> 01:01:37.398
Hey, Lizzie. Hey,
hey, hey, Lizzie.

667
01:01:37.998 --> 01:01:39.833
I know you think you
can help these people.

668
01:01:40.134 --> 01:01:42.469
That's why you're,
you're amazing.

669
01:01:43.938 --> 01:01:46.173
Whatever's happening
in this house is so big

670
01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.610
and dark that even a
fucking idiot like me

671
01:01:48.677 --> 01:01:50.311
knows you cannot pray it away.

672
01:01:50.377 --> 01:01:51.412
We're all she has.

673
01:01:51.478 --> 01:01:54.348
Fuck, no, Liz! Pack your shit.

674
01:01:55.416 --> 01:01:59.119
Lizzie, I'll leave you.

675
01:02:02.957 --> 01:02:06.794
Turning our back on
her would be a sin

676
01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:09.029
that dwarves all others.

677
01:02:14.368 --> 01:02:16.036
What do you wanna do?

678
01:02:24.111 --> 01:02:26.313
I wanna vanquish the demon.

679
01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:35.489
The substitute compound is
making her more aggressive.

680
01:02:37.124 --> 01:02:43.831
I might have to,
I might have to. Fuck!

681
01:02:48.035 --> 01:02:50.705
Every medicinal compound
ever created is just a litany

682
01:02:50.771 --> 01:02:53.474
of chemicals that either
trigger, inhibit,

683
01:02:53.541 --> 01:02:56.578
or neutralize until the
desired effect is reached.

684
01:02:57.111 --> 01:03:00.447
There's no precedent
for what we face,

685
01:03:00.749 --> 01:03:05.587
and this holding pattern
is becoming more harmful

686
01:03:05.654 --> 01:03:07.821
to her than the real thing.

687
01:03:13.327 --> 01:03:14.562
The real thing.

688
01:03:22.236 --> 01:03:26.641
Maybe just a micro dose
to get us through the storm.

689
01:03:46.528 --> 01:03:48.530
Hey, Faith. Hey.

690
01:03:49.597 --> 01:03:50.831
What is going on?

691
01:03:50.898 --> 01:03:51.832
Nothing.

692
01:03:51.899 --> 01:03:54.034
-Hmm?
-Yeah, I, I swear.

693
01:03:54.134 --> 01:03:54.968
You swear.

694
01:03:55.302 --> 01:03:57.404
I thought you Jesus freaks
weren't supposed to do that.

695
01:03:57.471 --> 01:04:00.207
Well, I'm kind of a failure
of being a Jesus freak.

696
01:04:00.274 --> 01:04:06.046
So she, um, she just
wants to help, okay?

697
01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.356
Charm has begun to
experience blackouts

698
01:04:15.422 --> 01:04:17.659
along with an extreme
personality disorder

699
01:04:17.726 --> 01:04:20.227
in which her body
physically alters.

700
01:04:20.294 --> 01:04:22.196
I have tracked a
continuous high fever,

701
01:04:22.262 --> 01:04:27.468
noting flashes of clarity
between 102 and 104.4 degrees.

702
01:04:27.535 --> 01:04:31.539
We'll attempt to maintain
that 2.4 degree safe zone

703
01:04:31.972 --> 01:04:36.043
via a controlled
methadone overdose.

704
01:04:36.745 --> 01:04:38.946
That's extremely
questionable parenting.

705
01:04:41.482 --> 01:04:44.586
Yesterday, I would've called
that plain manic overkill,

706
01:04:44.652 --> 01:04:45.486
but today?

707
01:04:47.756 --> 01:04:49.156
Porcupines, though?

708
01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:52.259
What kind of fever conjures
farm animals out of thin air?

709
01:04:52.326 --> 01:04:54.294
Mm, porcupines aren't
farm animals, Liz.

710
01:04:54.361 --> 01:04:55.329
Kory!

711
01:04:55.864 --> 01:04:56.964
Liz.

712
01:04:57.732 --> 01:04:58.733
You know there's a theory

713
01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:01.001
that 10% is what we
use of our brains

714
01:05:01.703 --> 01:05:04.639
and that full capacity
operation could be the result

715
01:05:04.706 --> 01:05:08.877
in unlocking of powers like
telepathy, telekinesis,

716
01:05:09.511 --> 01:05:12.446
that'd mean we'd only be
limited by our imagination.

717
01:05:14.516 --> 01:05:15.983
I don't know, it's kinda
like the Green Lantern,

718
01:05:16.049 --> 01:05:17.519
right, but without the rings?

719
01:05:18.419 --> 01:05:21.656
Don't try to tell us the same
lies you tell her, Faith.

720
01:05:22.489 --> 01:05:23.625
We know better.

721
01:05:23.758 --> 01:05:25.025
There are documented studies

722
01:05:25.092 --> 01:05:27.629
of drastic physical transitions.

723
01:05:27.695 --> 01:05:28.462
I could show you.

724
01:05:28.530 --> 01:05:30.397
Your room was interesting.

725
01:05:31.098 --> 01:05:33.802
That lab you got there is
rudimentary to say the least.

726
01:05:33.967 --> 01:05:35.235
Fuck you.

727
01:05:35.302 --> 01:05:39.908
Tell me about your compound,
Faith, about your cure.

728
01:05:39.973 --> 01:05:41.509
Fuck you.

729
01:05:42.409 --> 01:05:45.680
Fine. We'll just skip
to the lightning round.

730
01:05:49.049 --> 01:05:50.819
You might out of methadone,

731
01:05:50.951 --> 01:05:53.487
but your garage is
stocked full, huh?

732
01:05:53.555 --> 01:05:54.955
Fucking antifreeze?

733
01:05:55.022 --> 01:05:56.323
Two questions.

734
01:05:56.490 --> 01:05:59.894
What kind of mother pumps her
little girl full of this shit?

735
01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:03.197
And what kind of little
girl gets pumped full

736
01:06:03.263 --> 01:06:06.634
of this shit and doesn't die?

737
01:06:08.903 --> 01:06:11.438
Admit your hand in this,
Faith, and convince me

738
01:06:11.506 --> 01:06:15.108
that there is something at
work here other than the devil.

739
01:06:16.343 --> 01:06:21.716
The devil. You little bitch.

740
01:06:22.483 --> 01:06:23.918
You don't know shit.

741
01:06:24.519 --> 01:06:26.386
You don't know what it's
like to pull yourself out

742
01:06:26.453 --> 01:06:29.724
from the brink, to pull
your baby out, too,

743
01:06:29.791 --> 01:06:32.794
with no help, no one.

744
01:06:32.993 --> 01:06:35.530
Just the storm and
the resentment.

745
01:06:36.396 --> 01:06:39.032
You don't know what it's
like to be a mother!

746
01:06:40.167 --> 01:06:41.936
So you can take your good book

747
01:06:42.002 --> 01:06:44.539
and your fairy tale
fucking holiday!

748
01:06:44.606 --> 01:06:45.640
You mean Christmas?

749
01:06:45.707 --> 01:06:46.841
And your Ten Commandments.

750
01:06:46.908 --> 01:06:48.643
It's the season of His birth.

751
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:50.410
And you can go straight to hell!

752
01:06:57.619 --> 01:07:00.588
That spiked bat wasn't
meant for us, was it?

753
01:07:02.757 --> 01:07:04.124
You're scared.

754
01:07:06.226 --> 01:07:09.029
How many more weapons do you
have stashed around here?

755
01:07:10.565 --> 01:07:16.503
You have taken this as far
as you can go. Further, even.

756
01:07:17.037 --> 01:07:19.273
What are you holding onto?

757
01:07:19.373 --> 01:07:22.877
What is the sin whose
shadow in which you live?

758
01:07:27.882 --> 01:07:30.284
It is time to put
your confidence

759
01:07:30.350 --> 01:07:36.156
in something other than
yourself for her sake.

760
01:07:36.691 --> 01:07:38.358
Just say the word.

761
01:07:40.995 --> 01:07:42.030
You want my blessing?

762
01:07:42.095 --> 01:07:44.599
Yes. Yes, I do.

763
01:07:46.734 --> 01:07:47.702
Don't touch her.

764
01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:53.473
If you fucking touch her...

765
01:08:09.222 --> 01:08:10.792
It'll be painless, Faith.

766
01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:15.730
We just invoke His name
and we let Him decide

767
01:08:15.797 --> 01:08:22.336
who's right or wrong,
our truth or your poison.

768
01:08:22.402 --> 01:08:25.740
Don't lay a finger on her.
Don't you fucking touch her!

769
01:08:51.231 --> 01:08:53.266
Kory.

770
01:09:01.208 --> 01:09:03.611
Get out!

771
01:09:03.678 --> 01:09:06.446
-is Christ the King
-Get out of here!

772
01:09:06.514 --> 01:09:09.282
Stop!

773
01:09:11.052 --> 01:09:12.386
Get back here.

774
01:09:12.452 --> 01:09:15.056
Get back!

775
01:09:15.123 --> 01:09:15.890
Get out! Mom!

776
01:09:15.957 --> 01:09:17.892
-Mom!
-Coming!

777
01:09:23.397 --> 01:09:24.398
No!

778
01:09:25.099 --> 01:09:25.900
Mom!

779
01:09:39.379 --> 01:09:41.916
Oh, fuck!

780
01:09:51.224 --> 01:09:53.161
Breathe. Apply pressure.

781
01:09:54.996 --> 01:09:59.567
Okay. Okay, so we're oh for one.

782
01:10:00.267 --> 01:10:02.070
You're never gonna
convince her you're right.

783
01:10:02.436 --> 01:10:04.438
Your sister was
right about one thing.

784
01:10:04.739 --> 01:10:09.744
I am shooting in the dark.
Fever is all that I have.

785
01:10:10.511 --> 01:10:13.614
I just, I have to get control.

786
01:10:13.681 --> 01:10:18.351
Well, you had control,
but now it does.

787
01:10:19.252 --> 01:10:20.688
We gotta leave her.

788
01:10:21.155 --> 01:10:22.990
No, no!

789
01:10:23.891 --> 01:10:25.793
All right, well, um, uh, uh,

790
01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:28.663
Liz's stun gun in her bag maybe?

791
01:10:54.822 --> 01:10:58.325
I won't let anyone else
ever hurt her again!

792
01:11:10.838 --> 01:11:14.976
Hey, hey, somebody. Liz!

793
01:12:59.379 --> 01:13:00.915
Wait!

794
01:13:04.619 --> 01:13:07.355
P- pl- please, please don't go.

795
01:13:12.093 --> 01:13:13.460
Good luck, Nightingale.

796
01:13:41.822 --> 01:13:42.757
Shit. Shit.

797
01:13:49.630 --> 01:13:53.567
Oh!

798
01:14:18.826 --> 01:14:19.727
Okay, fuck.

799
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:03.871
Where is she?

800
01:15:06.173 --> 01:15:07.842
Tell me she's not out there.

801
01:15:10.077 --> 01:15:12.780
Oh God, Jesus.

802
01:15:18.786 --> 01:15:19.754
What if,

803
01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:25.292
what if He won't take me?

804
01:15:37.371 --> 01:15:39.640
Then you just come on back.

805
01:16:24.685 --> 01:16:27.088
When you said you
made mistakes before,

806
01:16:27.154 --> 01:16:28.122
was I one of them?

807
01:16:28.989 --> 01:16:30.357
No. No, baby.

808
01:16:30.424 --> 01:16:32.760
I, I thought I,

809
01:16:34.328 --> 01:16:35.530
I thought I saw something.

810
01:16:35.596 --> 01:16:36.730
I thought I saw something.

811
01:16:36.931 --> 01:16:38.766
Part of
recovering is letting go.

812
01:16:40.367 --> 01:16:41.570
I would never.

813
01:16:41.702 --> 01:16:43.137
She has this old
suitcase from her party days.

814
01:16:44.672 --> 01:16:45.673
I would never.

815
01:16:46.173 --> 01:16:49.410
No one feels guilty if
they're destroying something

816
01:16:49.477 --> 01:16:50.411
in order to build.

817
01:16:50.611 --> 01:16:54.615
I just can't do this!
I need help!

818
01:17:05.493 --> 01:17:09.096
I can't! Wait, no, I can't!

819
01:17:09.163 --> 01:17:11.600
I don't want to! No!

820
01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:21.675
I can't do it.

821
01:17:21.742 --> 01:17:23.911
I won't fucking do it!

822
01:17:26.615 --> 01:17:30.784
Please, please,
I won't fucking do it.

823
01:17:31.218 --> 01:17:34.121
Please, please, no!

824
01:17:41.495 --> 01:17:43.097
You know,
when they delivered you,

825
01:17:43.164 --> 01:17:44.999
I was so disoriented
from the drugs,

826
01:17:45.065 --> 01:17:46.667
I knew that I
couldn't be there for you,

827
01:17:49.203 --> 01:17:50.639
but this time I'm here
to pull you out the dark.

828
01:17:51.005 --> 01:17:53.440
I'm here to pull
you out of the dark.

829
01:17:53.908 --> 01:17:55.276
Pull you out of the dark.

830
01:17:55.577 --> 01:17:56.844
Pull you out of the dark.

831
01:21:49.544 --> 01:21:51.311
Come on. Charm!

832
01:22:54.843 --> 01:22:56.276
KLU,
Louisville, Kentucky.

833
01:22:56.343 --> 01:22:59.179
K-top mornings with the bishop.
Get your shorts out, folks.

834
01:22:59.246 --> 01:23:01.583
We got a high of 75 today.

835
01:23:01.649 --> 01:23:05.118
Spring sprung it in January,
a few months early it seems.

836
01:23:05.185 --> 01:23:07.120
there are reports all
over the Louisville area

837
01:23:07.187 --> 01:23:09.223
of flash floodings
melting off the snow

838
01:23:09.289 --> 01:23:11.559
from last week's
white out blizzard,

839
01:23:11.626 --> 01:23:13.227
so be careful out there.

840
01:23:13.293 --> 01:23:14.662
Don't be a stranger over here.

841
01:23:16.063 --> 01:23:17.498
Do you have any
plans this morning?

842
01:23:17.565 --> 01:23:18.733
I'm happy
about it. I'll still-

843
01:23:19.399 --> 01:23:21.168
Gonna add some flowers
to my painting.

844
01:23:21.235 --> 01:23:23.337
You know,
dig into my multimedia bag.

845
01:23:23.403 --> 01:23:26.173
Some, oh, maybe you should
try some gold leafing.

846
01:23:26.674 --> 01:23:27.642
I can help you pick some.

847
01:23:28.375 --> 01:23:30.277
Of course. The more the merrier.

848
01:23:31.078 --> 01:23:31.846
I'll go change.

849
01:23:31.913 --> 01:23:33.080
Okay.

850
01:23:39.721 --> 01:23:40.588
Mom?

851
01:23:40.655 --> 01:23:41.523
Yeah?

852
01:23:43.925 --> 01:23:45.092
Thanks.

853
01:23:46.326 --> 01:23:47.261
For what?

854
01:23:48.362 --> 01:23:51.533
Pulling me out of the dark
like you said you would.

855
01:24:51.358 --> 01:24:54.194
Tell me the worst
thing you've ever done.

856
01:24:54.896 --> 01:24:56.263
I was a bad person.

857
01:25:09.577 --> 01:25:12.212
You're not gonna get a
bigger crown in heaven

858
01:25:12.279 --> 01:25:14.348
trying to save something
that's already lost.

859
01:25:14.414 --> 01:25:16.718
What the fuck are we
doing here then, Liz?

860
01:25:17.819 --> 01:25:20.855
I, I don't believe, I had
a connection, you know?

861
01:25:20.922 --> 01:25:22.023
Yeah, I bet.

862
01:25:22.090 --> 01:25:23.290
No, it's, it's more than that.

863
01:25:23.357 --> 01:25:27.227
It's, it's the, she, I
think she'll listen to me,

864
01:25:28.596 --> 01:25:29.697
so I gotta try.

865
01:25:36.169 --> 01:25:39.841
Kory, she doesn't
want to be saved.

866
01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:01.062
Hey!

867
01:26:09.037 --> 01:26:10.104
Come with me.

868
01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:24.217
I wanna help you.

869
01:26:24.519 --> 01:26:25.653
Mm.

870
01:26:25.987 --> 01:26:27.021
Let's get outta here.

871
01:26:27.088 --> 01:26:28.488
We can leave.
We can go somewhere else.

872
01:26:31.993 --> 01:26:35.395
Shh. Shh.

873
01:26:46.741 --> 01:26:49.977
I'm gonna cum so hard when
I pop your fucking cherry.

874
01:26:54.281 --> 01:26:55.215
What are you doing?

875
01:26:55.683 --> 01:26:58.218
Faith. Faith, what the
fuck, what the fuck?

876
01:27:15.570 --> 01:27:19.439
I enjoyed
corrupting innocence.

877
01:27:25.245 --> 01:27:26.446
Somebody help!

878
01:27:28.850 --> 01:27:29.851
Somebody help!

879
01:27:36.991 --> 01:27:38.358
You hammer,

880
01:27:38.425 --> 01:27:40.828
I'll see to his knee, and we'll
figure out the rest later.

881
01:27:41.596 --> 01:27:44.364
Who are you now?
Our little home invader?

882
01:27:45.332 --> 01:27:48.603
Charm, it's me, Liz.

883
01:27:50.238 --> 01:27:51.739
Yeah, I know who you are

884
01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:55.009
Uh, this is Liz and that's Kory.

885
01:28:10.057 --> 01:28:13.060
Take your fucking medicine!

886
01:28:15.163 --> 01:28:17.430
Don't you fucking touch her!

887
01:28:17.497 --> 01:28:20.968
I won't let anyone else
ever hurt her again!

888
01:28:23.137 --> 01:28:24.806
I can't keep this up.

889
01:28:37.450 --> 01:28:38.653
Wait.

890
01:28:43.624 --> 01:28:44.592
Wait.

891
01:28:45.358 --> 01:28:46.294
You stay back!

892
01:28:48.095 --> 01:28:49.462
You get away!

893
01:28:49.530 --> 01:28:51.699
Please, please don't go.

894
01:28:54.235 --> 01:28:55.136
Please.

895
01:29:49.422 --> 01:29:51.458
No one's getting
out of this zoo.
