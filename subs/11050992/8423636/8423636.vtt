There'll be more damages
than we meant to cause.

183
00:13:57.037 --> 00:13:59.973
Do you know what'll happen
if you send us out there?

184
00:14:00.809 --> 00:14:03.043
I'm not sure I'd be able
to live with myself.

185
00:14:04.011 --> 00:14:05.346
But your house, your call.

186
00:14:05.412 --> 00:14:07.549
[wind whistling]

187
00:14:07.615 --> 00:14:09.116
Please, please.

188
00:14:09.584 --> 00:14:14.756
[sighs] Dammit. Help me
get him to the couch.

189
00:14:15.155 --> 00:14:16.791
-Breathe, just breathe.
-Okay.

190
00:14:16.857 --> 00:14:17.759
-I'm breathing!
-Little faster.

191
00:14:17.826 --> 00:14:19.126
I think I'm hyperventilating.

192
00:14:19.193 --> 00:14:20.260
I'm gonna fucking pass out now.

193
00:14:20.327 --> 00:14:22.530
-Ow, fuck, come on!
-Ooh, sorry,

194
00:14:22.597 --> 00:14:25.132
-sorry, sorry!
-Ow! Oh, fuck.

195
00:14:26.701 --> 00:14:28.503
Ooh, okay, rags.

196
00:14:28.703 --> 00:14:29.704
-Huh?
-In the kitchen

197
00:14:29.771 --> 00:14:31.105
-underneath the sink!
-[Kory grunts]

198
00:14:31.238 --> 00:14:34.174
Ah, okay, I'm ready.
Just, just, just yank it.

199
00:14:34.241 --> 00:14:35.909
Yeah, it's not
gonna be that simple.

200
00:14:36.243 --> 00:14:37.177
What?

201
00:14:41.014 --> 00:14:41.716
[gasps] What is that?

202
00:14:41.783 --> 00:14:42.883
[bag thumps]

203
00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.652
No, no, no, no, no
tools, no, no. It's okay.

204
00:14:44.719 --> 00:14:46.688
Trust me, this is the easy way.

205
00:14:47.254 --> 00:14:48.422
-[Kory exhales]
-Uh, what do I do?

206
00:14:49.022 --> 00:14:51.024
Roll it up and
put it in his mouth.

207
00:14:51.325 --> 00:14:52.126
[Liz] Okay.

208
00:14:52.226 --> 00:14:53.862
Hell of a time to
be out for a stroll.

209
00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:56.063
Blizzard's been full tilt
for the past six days.

210
00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.898
Yeah, I told her that this
little missionary trip

211
00:14:57.965 --> 00:14:58.932
could wait till spring.

212
00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:00.100
-This isn't-
-Well 'tis the season.

213
00:15:00.167 --> 00:15:02.637
[Faith] All right.
Hold the bat still.

214
00:15:02.704 --> 00:15:04.037
There's gonna be
more blood coming.

215
00:15:04.839 --> 00:15:07.174
-Here we go.
-[Kory whimpering]

216
00:15:07.908 --> 00:15:09.042
[Faith] All right.

217
00:15:09.878 --> 00:15:10.944
-[drill whirling]
-[Kory yells]

218
00:15:11.011 --> 00:15:12.112
-Oh, shit! Sorry!
-[Kory yelling]

219
00:15:12.179 --> 00:15:13.648
[Kory] What the fuck, man?

220
00:15:13.748 --> 00:15:14.982
-I'm sorry.
-[Kory crying]

221
00:15:15.282 --> 00:15:18.085
[sighs] I'm sorry. Are you ready

222
00:15:18.152 --> 00:15:18.986
No!

223
00:15:19.052 --> 00:15:20.954
-[drill whirling]
-[Kory screaming]

00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:22.824

-[Faith grunting]
-[Kory grunting]

226
00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:30.297
-Okay.
-Just you here?

227
00:15:30.364 --> 00:15:33.133
-[Kory breathing heavily]
-I have a daughter.

228
00:15:34.334 --> 00:15:35.670
She has a fever.

229
00:15:37.171 --> 00:15:38.939
Is that her room at the door?

230
00:15:39.841 --> 00:15:42.276
She's not a basket
case or something?

231
00:15:42.744 --> 00:15:43.711
[object loudly thuds]

232
00:15:43.778 --> 00:15:46.748
[creature growling]

233
00:15:47.047 --> 00:15:50.384
Apply pressure.
Do not leave this room.

234
00:15:53.487 --> 00:15:55.189
[tense suspenseful music]

235
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.959
[wind whistling]

237
00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:10.170
[door squeaking]

238
00:16:16.511 --> 00:16:17.444
Charm?

239
00:16:21.683 --> 00:16:24.686
[dramatic tense music]

240
00:16:29.557 --> 00:16:30.558
[creature growling]

241
00:16:31.158 --> 00:16:36.196
[dramatic ominous music]

242
00:16:36.865 --> 00:16:37.866
Charm.

243
00:16:38.131 --> 00:16:42.336
[gentle suspenseful music]

244
00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:49.677
[dramatic tense music]

245
00:16:58.085 --> 00:16:59.754
[eerie foreboding music]

246
00:16:59.821 --> 00:17:06.761
[thermometer beeping]

247
00:17:25.479 --> 00:17:26.246
[Faith sighs]

251
00:17:43.263 --> 00:17:43.998
[creature growling]

252
00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:46.199
[cloth ripping]

253
00:17:47.769 --> 00:17:49.202
[objects thudding]

254
00:17:49.837 --> 00:17:50.972
[creature growling]

[wood banging]

260
00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:20.434
You hammer,
I'll see to his knee,

261
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.135
and we'll figure
out the rest later.

262
00:18:22.202 --> 00:18:25.205
[wind whistling]

263
00:18:33.615 --> 00:18:35.215
[Charm gasps]

264
00:18:37.051 --> 00:18:38.586
[Charm exhaling]

265
00:18:41.589 --> 00:18:44.592
[gentle eerie music]

266
00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.757
Nice house. Must be
one heck of a nurse.

267
00:19:16.824 --> 00:19:18.026
I had a hospice patient.

268
00:19:18.325 --> 00:19:19.359
We worked together
for two years.

269
00:19:19.426 --> 00:19:20.327
I didn't think she
liked me very much,

270
00:19:20.394 --> 00:19:24.197
but she went, her will came,

271
00:19:24.264 --> 00:19:25.667
it was hers, and now it's mine.

272
00:19:28.036 --> 00:19:29.236
Thanks.

273
00:19:31.271 --> 00:19:32.807
Guest room.
It's yours for the night.

274
00:19:33.941 --> 00:19:35.076
[wind whistling]

275
00:19:35.143 --> 00:19:37.545
[necklace jangling]

276
00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:39.647
Does that make you feel safe?

277
00:19:42.617 --> 00:19:46.253
Yeah, absolutely. What
makes you feel safe?

278
00:19:47.922 --> 00:19:49.924
Big bats with screws in them.

279
00:19:53.561 --> 00:19:56.196
So what's your daughter's deal?

280
00:19:57.865 --> 00:19:59.867
I told you. She has a fever.

281
00:20:00.034 --> 00:20:01.936
Yeah, it must be pretty bad.

282
00:20:02.003 --> 00:20:03.236
And all the metal.

283
00:20:04.172 --> 00:20:06.007
She's prone to
psychotic episodes.

284
00:20:06.074 --> 00:20:08.241
I'd insist that you stay away.

285
00:20:10.511 --> 00:20:12.714
You're the boss, Nightingale.

286
00:20:13.047 --> 00:20:14.247
Yeah.

287
00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:22.623
Thanks again.

288
00:20:23.191 --> 00:20:26.426
[footsteps thumping]

289
00:20:26.928 --> 00:20:27.929
[Charm] I heard voices.

290
00:20:29.329 --> 00:20:30.798
Are there really
people down there?

291
00:20:30.865 --> 00:20:33.034
[Faith] Uh, yeah, they just,
they got caught in the storm,

292
00:20:33.101 --> 00:20:35.737
so it's just gonna
be for a few hours.

293
00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.740
I could get dressed, say hi.

294
00:20:39.339 --> 00:20:41.209
You know that's not a good idea.

295
00:20:41.609 --> 00:20:46.714
I just, I just wanna
talk to somebody.

296
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.684
Charm, these people, they're,
they're drifters, okay?

297
00:20:49.751 --> 00:20:51.451
The 8 ball they did in
the shelter's probably

298
00:20:51.519 --> 00:20:53.821
the only reason why
they're not frozen solid.

299
00:20:55.288 --> 00:20:56.490
You would know.

300
00:20:57.892 --> 00:20:58.893
I would fucking know!

301
00:21:00.795 --> 00:21:03.564
[wind whistling]

302
00:21:03.631 --> 00:21:06.968
Can you just trust
me for once? Please?

303
00:21:08.703 --> 00:21:10.037
[door banging]

304
00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.041
[creature growling]

305
00:21:19.747 --> 00:21:21.749
[door slams]

306
00:21:22.049 --> 00:21:23.316
2.4 degrees.

307
00:21:24.585 --> 00:21:26.954
That's all that's keeping her
from slipping away from me.

308
00:21:27.889 --> 00:21:28.790
Again.

309
00:21:29.123 --> 00:21:31.424
[eerie unsettling music]

310
00:21:31.491 --> 00:21:35.029
I know addiction,
I know sickness,

311
00:21:37.031 --> 00:21:42.703
but what has Charm is
a biological nightmare,

312
00:21:44.972 --> 00:21:46.741
and I'm fighting it the
only way that I know how,

313
00:21:47.241 --> 00:21:48.576
[liquid burbling]

314
00:21:53.413 --> 00:21:56.349
but that, that safe
zone, that coveted window

315
00:21:57.218 --> 00:21:59.419
is getting harder and
harder to maintain.

316
00:22:03.724 --> 00:22:09.831
I'm so tired and my
sweet, sweet girl, she is

317
00:22:10.131 --> 00:22:11.098
[Charm screaming]

318
00:22:11.165 --> 00:22:12.700
[creature growling]

319
00:22:13.034 --> 00:22:14.135
running out of time.

320
00:22:14.202 --> 00:22:17.370
[eerie suspenseful music]

321
00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:24.612
[Kory grunts]

322
00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.685
[gentle eerie music]

323
00:22:45.766 --> 00:22:47.869
[Kory] [exhales] We got lucky.

324
00:22:48.302 --> 00:22:49.402
Wasn't luck.

325
00:22:49.604 --> 00:22:50.972
Yeah, no, I know it.

326
00:22:51.038 --> 00:22:52.472
I'm just, you know what I mean.

327
00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:55.375
You mean we found the house
at the end of the rainbow

328
00:22:55.442 --> 00:22:57.011
like the leprechaun
said we would?

329
00:22:57.545 --> 00:22:59.013
Oh, look under the cushion.

330
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.083
Maybe there's some gold coins
sprinkled about, laddie.

331
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:03.517
I get it already.

332
00:23:03.651 --> 00:23:05.219
And credit where it's due, huh?

333
00:23:05.286 --> 00:23:06.988
No, just saying

334
00:23:07.622 --> 00:23:10.224
that this is an extremely
fortunate situation.

335
00:23:10.457 --> 00:23:12.927
Found a nice warm
house with the power on

336
00:23:12.994 --> 00:23:17.464
and the hostess is a nurse among
other bucket-list fetishes.

337
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.433
That was a joke, Liz.

338
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.435
[sighs] But I
tell you that anyone

339
00:23:22.503 --> 00:23:24.038
who looks at a woman lustfully

340
00:23:24.105 --> 00:23:27.508
has already committed adultery
with her in his heart.

341
00:23:28.109 --> 00:23:31.746
Liz, I'm not married.

342
00:23:35.082 --> 00:23:40.021
I'm sorry. I'm in your
corner no matter what.

343
00:23:41.689 --> 00:23:46.527
We just can't have
another misunderstanding.

344
00:23:48.729 --> 00:23:49.764
Okay.

345
00:23:50.197 --> 00:23:51.198
Not now.

346
00:23:51.699 --> 00:23:54.068
[unsettling foreboding music]

347
00:23:55.303 --> 00:23:57.305
[Faith humming]

348
00:23:57.805 --> 00:23:59.874
[Charm] So what are you
looking for exactly?

349
00:24:00.308 --> 00:24:01.474
Intracranial hemorrhaging.

350
00:24:01.642 --> 00:24:04.078
It's a possible side effect
from a prolonged fever.

351
00:24:05.546 --> 00:24:07.214
So brain damage.

352
00:24:08.582 --> 00:24:10.051
It's just a precaution.

353
00:24:10.318 --> 00:24:13.554
Heavy recovery from any
medication has a mini withdrawal

354
00:24:13.821 --> 00:24:15.556
Psychosis is a possibility.

355
00:24:15.623 --> 00:24:16.991
Auditory and visual
hallucinations,

356
00:24:17.058 --> 00:24:21.028
lucid sleepwalking,
but you'll be fine.

357
00:24:26.033 --> 00:24:31.572
When you said you made mistakes
before, was I one of them?

358
00:24:37.712 --> 00:24:39.547
I've made mistakes before you,

359
00:24:40.581 --> 00:24:43.150
after you, with you,

360
00:24:46.354 --> 00:24:47.722
but never you.

361
00:24:51.425 --> 00:24:55.129
So who are they downstairs?

362
00:24:56.864 --> 00:25:01.502
Um, they're just some kids
who got caught in the storm.

363
00:25:01.902 --> 00:25:02.703
Kids?

364
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:04.972
Well, no, no, they're adults.

365
00:25:05.706 --> 00:25:06.807
Well, you just said kids.

366
00:25:06.874 --> 00:25:07.975
Okay, it's a figure of speech.

367
00:25:08.042 --> 00:25:09.577
Which is the exact
opposite of adults.

368
00:25:09.643 --> 00:25:10.311
Why are you pushing me?

369
00:25:10.378 --> 00:25:11.512
I'm not pushing you.

370
00:25:11.579 --> 00:25:13.080
I just wanna have some
normal interaction with-

371
00:25:13.147 --> 00:25:15.082
Well, you're not normal!

372
00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.022
[wind whistling]

373
00:25:21.088 --> 00:25:23.758
You're more, Charm.

374
00:25:24.992 --> 00:25:25.893
You're more, okay?

375
00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.030
You're more than anyone
could ever understand.

376
00:25:30.464 --> 00:25:31.866
And what's happening right now

377
00:25:31.932 --> 00:25:34.802
leads away from logic
into pure phenomena,

378
00:25:35.836 --> 00:25:37.805
so it, it, it
doesn't make it easier.

379
00:25:37.872 --> 00:25:41.642
It makes it harder. [exhales]

380
00:25:41.709 --> 00:25:43.577
[gentle eerie music]

381
00:25:43.644 --> 00:25:47.681
I promise I won't
give up if you don't,

382
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:49.950
but you have to trust me.

383
00:25:59.226 --> 00:26:01.328
All right. Maybe a quick dinner.

384
00:26:02.563 --> 00:26:06.067
[pills clattering]

385
00:26:06.133 --> 00:26:10.137
What are those? Those aren't
what you normally, um...

386
00:26:12.073 --> 00:26:14.041
Dinner or not, kiddo?

387
00:26:14.108 --> 00:26:20.948
[tense unsettling music]

388
00:26:27.888 --> 00:26:30.691
Okay. Well, I will
leave the door unlocked.

389
00:26:30.758 --> 00:26:32.293
Come down in about 20 minutes.

390
00:26:42.903 --> 00:26:46.107
[tense suspenseful music]

391
00:27:00.555 --> 00:27:01.556
[door creaks]

392
00:27:01.889 --> 00:27:05.092
[tense unsettling music]

393
00:27:06.427 --> 00:27:08.662
[Kory grunting]

394
00:27:24.311 --> 00:27:26.347
[toilet flushes]

395
00:27:34.688 --> 00:27:36.657
Oh, come on man. You're
gotta say something.

396
00:27:36.724 --> 00:27:38.726
She's gonna think you're
a fucking serial killer.

397
00:27:38.792 --> 00:27:42.129
Um, hey, going hiking?

398
00:27:43.063 --> 00:27:46.066
[wind whistling]

399
00:27:48.802 --> 00:27:51.005
[Charm] Who are you now?

400
00:27:51.172 --> 00:27:52.806
Our little home invader?

401
00:27:52.873 --> 00:27:55.009
Yeah. Yep, that's me, Kory.

402
00:27:55.075 --> 00:27:57.945
Sorry, um, uh, it, it, it, just,

403
00:27:58.012 --> 00:28:00.181
I'm not, I'm not
dangerous, okay.

404
00:28:00.381 --> 00:28:02.249
Said every serial killer ever.

405
00:28:02.316 --> 00:28:04.785
Okay, please, please
don't. Please don't scream.

406
00:28:04.852 --> 00:28:05.554
Liz will freak out and then-

407
00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:06.820
Liz?

408
00:28:06.887 --> 00:28:09.123
Yeah, that's my sister who
thinks she is my mother.

409
00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.325
You know, I love her,
I, I, it's just like,

410
00:28:11.392 --> 00:28:14.395
don't you wish people would
back the fuck off sometimes?

411
00:28:14.862 --> 00:28:18.165
All the time.
You coming out or what?

412
00:28:18.732 --> 00:28:22.069
Uh, I was sort of
thinking I'd stay here

413
00:28:22.136 --> 00:28:24.305
because, uh,
if you don't see me,

414
00:28:24.371 --> 00:28:27.676
then we got a little bit of,
uh, uh, plausible deniability,

415
00:28:27.741 --> 00:28:28.909
you know what I mean?

416
00:28:35.849 --> 00:28:39.286
So you're pretty
into porcupines, huh?

417
00:28:41.188 --> 00:28:42.156
[Charm] I hate them.

418
00:28:42.624 --> 00:28:46.160
Oh, yeah, sure.
That explains the shrine.

419
00:28:46.628 --> 00:28:47.928
It's hard to exert
control over something

420
00:28:47.995 --> 00:28:50.197
when you're too
busy running from it.

421
00:28:50.632 --> 00:28:53.000
Sounds like you got
some adult concerns.

422
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.170
Yeah, I'm
juggling a few others.

423
00:28:56.337 --> 00:28:58.439
Oh, yeah. Like what?

424
00:29:00.241 --> 00:29:03.377
Like the effect antifreeze
has on one's innards.

425
00:29:08.249 --> 00:29:11.218
Did you know porcupine
means pig with swords?

426
00:29:11.352 --> 00:29:15.055
Did you know their quills
are basically calcified hair?

427
00:29:15.222 --> 00:29:16.290
[Kory] I did not.

428
00:29:16.357 --> 00:29:18.259
And that at the right angle
they sink into the flesh,

429
00:29:18.325 --> 00:29:19.728
like hot rebar.

430
00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.997
[chuckles] How did
you find that out?

431
00:29:25.634 --> 00:29:26.834
The hard way.

432
00:29:27.702 --> 00:29:29.638
[dramatic tense music]

433
00:29:29.704 --> 00:29:32.139
My mom had surprised me
with a trip to the zoo.

434
00:29:34.475 --> 00:29:35.776
Like always, she felt bad

435
00:29:35.843 --> 00:29:37.444
and thought this would
make everything okay.

436
00:29:37.512 --> 00:29:39.146
[people chattering indistinctly]

437
00:29:41.115 --> 00:29:42.116
You wanna take it
outta my pocket?

438
00:29:42.182 --> 00:29:43.150
-Yeah, I do!
-But even then

439
00:29:43.217 --> 00:29:44.753
I could see
through her bullshit.

440
00:29:44.818 --> 00:29:46.521
[Faith] Where is it, huh?
What you gonna do with it?

441
00:29:46.588 --> 00:29:48.723
What are you gonna do with
it? Better give it on back!

442
00:29:48.956 --> 00:29:50.958
-The look in her eye.
-Who you gonna sell it to?

443
00:29:51.058 --> 00:29:52.259
[Charm] It was
more than hunger.

444
00:29:52.426 --> 00:29:56.163
It was, it scared me,

445
00:29:58.365 --> 00:29:59.133
so I ran.

446
00:29:59.199 --> 00:30:03.170
[unsettling foreboding music]

447
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:07.542
There were people everywhere,
but no one helped.

448
00:30:11.713 --> 00:30:14.148
[door creaking]

449
00:30:15.349 --> 00:30:17.918
Ran through the first
door I could find,

450
00:30:21.255 --> 00:30:22.256
the wrong one.

451
00:30:22.923 --> 00:30:24.058
Mama, Mama, Mama.

452
00:30:24.124 --> 00:30:25.760
The smell hit me first.

453
00:30:25.826 --> 00:30:26.728
[porcupine growling]

454
00:30:26.795 --> 00:30:30.130
Then I, I saw it.

455
00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.167
[Charm yelling]

456
00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:40.207
Possession, negligence. They
arrested her on the spot.

457
00:30:41.041 --> 00:30:42.677
How long did they keep her?

458
00:30:43.043 --> 00:30:47.881
She kept herself. 7
rehab stints in 10 years.

459
00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:52.920
But, but she's, uh, she's all
better now, though, right?

460
00:30:52.986 --> 00:30:56.256
Like she's, uh,
rehabilitated or whatever.

461
00:30:58.058 --> 00:31:00.160
Part of recovering
is letting go.

462
00:31:02.429 --> 00:31:03.263
She has this old suitcase

463
00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:05.399
from her party days
out in the garage.

464
00:31:06.467 --> 00:31:07.267
Probably still something

465
00:31:07.334 --> 00:31:10.037
in there to make
all the pain go away.

466
00:31:11.271 --> 00:31:12.940
Guess all that shit with
your mom is the reason

467
00:31:13.006 --> 00:31:15.275
you got the whole tortured
artist thing going on, right?

468
00:31:15.342 --> 00:31:17.612
I mean, well,
I mean almost anyway, right?

469
00:31:17.679 --> 00:31:18.646
What do you mean?

470
00:31:18.747 --> 00:31:20.114
I don't know, I mean, um,

471
00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:23.618
no obsession is complete
without a cool origin story, so.

472
00:31:24.619 --> 00:31:27.555
Some battle scars might have
sold it better. That's all.

473
00:31:27.622 --> 00:31:31.559
[gentle suspenseful music]

474
00:31:35.062 --> 00:31:38.265
[gentle eerie music]

475
00:31:46.741 --> 00:31:48.375
[Faith] Honey
are you coming down?

476
00:31:50.043 --> 00:31:51.412
[chuckles] Guess it's showtime.

477
00:31:51.478 --> 00:31:53.548
[Kory] Yeah, yeah,
I guess I better, um...

478
00:31:53.615 --> 00:31:55.215
Escape?

479
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:58.686
No one's getting
out of this zoo.

480
00:32:13.735 --> 00:32:15.102
[Kory grunts]

481
00:32:17.672 --> 00:32:19.473
[Charm exhales]

482
00:32:21.375 --> 00:32:22.376
What? Okay.

483
00:32:23.944 --> 00:32:25.914
[Kory grunting]

484
00:32:25.979 --> 00:32:28.148
-Pass that.
-Oh, thank you.

485
00:32:28.282 --> 00:32:29.283
Thanks.

486
00:32:29.584 --> 00:32:30.585
Smells great, ma'am.

487
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:41.395
Hi, Charm. Uh, this is
Liz and that's Kory.

488
00:32:44.532 --> 00:32:48.503
Uh, we appreciate
your hospitality.

489
00:32:50.471 --> 00:32:51.739
We'll see.

490
00:32:55.976 --> 00:32:57.377
Uh, before we start eating,

491
00:32:57.444 --> 00:33:00.548
I would be honored to
lead us in a blessing.

492
00:33:00.615 --> 00:33:02.082
If we could all join hands?

493
00:33:06.921 --> 00:33:07.922
[Liz clears throat]

494
00:33:08.422 --> 00:33:12.025
Heavenly Father, thank you
for leading us out of the cold

495
00:33:12.092 --> 00:33:14.796
and into the limitless
warmth of Your love.

496
00:33:15.195 --> 00:33:18.499
Please bless our food,
but especially our host,

497
00:33:18.867 --> 00:33:21.168
hostesses who have graced us

498
00:33:21.235 --> 00:33:23.505
with an all-too-rare compassion.

499
00:33:23.771 --> 00:33:25.840
In Your name, we say

500
00:33:25.907 --> 00:33:27.207
-amen.
-[Faith clears throat]

501
00:33:29.276 --> 00:33:30.778
[Faith clears throat]

502
00:33:32.079 --> 00:33:33.347
Let's eat.

503
00:33:33.548 --> 00:33:36.350
So we're making tracks along
the road outside Shelby Bowl,

504
00:33:36.416 --> 00:33:37.719
and then the snow just
starts dumping on us.

505
00:33:37.785 --> 00:33:40.722
Mm-hmm, and we need shelter,
but we wanna keep moving.

506
00:33:40.788 --> 00:33:42.189
-Bus, right?
-Wrong.

507
00:33:42.256 --> 00:33:44.124
[Liz] Some kind human
took it upon themselves

508
00:33:44.191 --> 00:33:46.326
to knock down every
stop marker for like-

509
00:33:46.393 --> 00:33:47.962
For like, it's
like two miles easy.

510
00:33:48.028 --> 00:33:49.196
So the buses are going by us

511
00:33:49.263 --> 00:33:50.532
and we're screaming
bloody murder.

512
00:33:50.598 --> 00:33:54.034
Yeah, for hours, so then
I gave up and I sat down-

513
00:33:54.101 --> 00:33:55.402
In the snow.

514
00:33:55.469 --> 00:33:56.436
And I cried.

515
00:33:56.504 --> 00:33:57.539
Yes, you did.

516
00:33:57.672 --> 00:34:00.374
Mm, why didn't you just pray

517
00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.677
for the limitless
warmth of His love?

518
00:34:07.782 --> 00:34:10.652
Uh, I did that, too.

519
00:34:10.718 --> 00:34:12.052
Well, help me understand.

520
00:34:12.119 --> 00:34:13.320
Like, maybe you can
explain it to me.

521
00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:17.357
So when you have food
right, you thank Him for it,

522
00:34:17.424 --> 00:34:20.895
but when you are trapped
in sub-zero temperatures,

523
00:34:20.962 --> 00:34:22.830
that's a sign, right?

524
00:34:23.565 --> 00:34:24.933
A sign of what?

525
00:34:25.098 --> 00:34:27.067
That God wants you
to freeze to death.

526
00:34:27.769 --> 00:34:31.673
I don't think God wants
anyone to freeze to death.

527
00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:37.411
I think God uses the cold
like a farmer would use

528
00:34:37.477 --> 00:34:41.481
an electric fence to steer
you to where you belong.

529
00:34:41.783 --> 00:34:44.519
Okay, so say God
steers you here

530
00:34:44.686 --> 00:34:47.822
and I send you right back out
the window that you came in,

531
00:34:48.455 --> 00:34:52.492
and then, you know,
something bad happens.

532
00:34:52.827 --> 00:34:54.127
Who's the guilty party?

533
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:56.330
The party that feels guilty.

534
00:34:57.532 --> 00:34:58.398
I don't know.

535
00:34:58.566 --> 00:35:00.635
Doesn't His plan kind of
give me an out, though?

536
00:35:00.902 --> 00:35:03.136
Like, no repercussions,
cause like, whatever I do,

537
00:35:03.203 --> 00:35:07.508
whatever happens,
it's His plan, right?

538
00:35:10.645 --> 00:35:13.113
Well, God...

539
00:35:13.347 --> 00:35:15.850
Have you ever heard
of the term PBAB?

540
00:35:16.985 --> 00:35:18.586
Pine box at bedside?

541
00:35:20.688 --> 00:35:24.025
Yeah, I've been a
nurse for 10 years now,

542
00:35:24.191 --> 00:35:25.392
and I've helped more
people evade death

543
00:35:25.459 --> 00:35:27.327
than you could even fathom,

544
00:35:27.562 --> 00:35:29.463
and it wasn't because I
waited for holy intervention

545
00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.198
or because I
trusted in the plan.

546
00:35:31.532 --> 00:35:34.334
I acted. The use of
science is an act.

547
00:35:34.769 --> 00:35:37.204
And the people who believe
in the myth to save them,

548
00:35:37.471 --> 00:35:40.508
they build those pine boxes
and the people who act,

549
00:35:40.708 --> 00:35:42.275
we keep them empty.

550
00:35:46.346 --> 00:35:49.917
I think one day
you're gonna wonder

551
00:35:49.984 --> 00:35:51.552
what else you are wrong about.

552
00:35:55.255 --> 00:35:56.423
Emerald twilight.

553
00:35:58.425 --> 00:35:59.027
What?

554
00:35:59.192 --> 00:36:02.195
Oh, Mom, you're gonna love this.

555
00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:05.298
Hal Jordan, Earth's
Green Lantern, uh,

556
00:36:05.365 --> 00:36:08.335
he comes back from this cosmic
ass-kicking marathon, right?

557
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:12.272
And he finds his home, Coast
City, completely annihilated.

558
00:36:12.607 --> 00:36:17.578
Everything he ever loved or
held dear is just a crater.

559
00:36:19.279 --> 00:36:23.818
So he's devastated
and he gets an idea.

560
00:36:25.485 --> 00:36:29.023
He uses his ring to
resurrect Coast City.

561
00:36:29.824 --> 00:36:32.960
All the buildings are back
and people stroll the streets,

562
00:36:34.028 --> 00:36:36.263
holding hands and
sharing embraces

563
00:36:36.329 --> 00:36:37.397
with the one who got away.

564
00:36:37.464 --> 00:36:39.399
He even spends time
with his dead mother

565
00:36:39.466 --> 00:36:42.202
[gentle suspenseful music]

566
00:36:42.269 --> 00:36:43.838
till his ring runs out of power.

567
00:36:45.673 --> 00:36:47.008
So he shoots up into space to
get back to his home planet

568
00:36:47.075 --> 00:36:51.713
where their,
where their power source is,

569
00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:54.048
and he needs it.

570
00:36:54.716 --> 00:36:56.651
He needs all of it to
keep Coast City alive,

571
00:36:56.718 --> 00:36:58.853
but the, the Guardians
and the other Lanterns,

572
00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:02.990
they won't let him have it,
so he obliterates them all.

573
00:37:03.057 --> 00:37:04.224
[Charm chuckles]

574
00:37:06.027 --> 00:37:07.028
Charm. Charm?

575
00:37:07.327 --> 00:37:10.631
No one feels guilty if
they're destroying something

576
00:37:10.698 --> 00:37:11.866
in order to build.

577
00:37:12.299 --> 00:37:18.438
Not God, not superheroes,
not fucking politicians.

578
00:37:18.506 --> 00:37:20.240
[gentle suspenseful
music continues]

579
00:37:24.011 --> 00:37:25.780
But I think we should.

580
00:37:26.214 --> 00:37:27.782
I, I think.

581
00:37:28.482 --> 00:37:30.852
-[Charm gasping]
-[dramatic foreboding music]

582
00:37:30.918 --> 00:37:32.186
Charm. Charm!

583
00:37:32.252 --> 00:37:33.755
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, Charm!

584
00:37:33.821 --> 00:37:35.656
Oh my god, this is a
seizure. What do we do?

585
00:37:35.723 --> 00:37:37.290
Can't just stand here.
We gotta do something.

586
00:37:37.357 --> 00:37:38.593
Help me lie her straight.

587
00:37:38.659 --> 00:37:39.927
No, you're supposed to put
something in her mouth.

588
00:37:39.994 --> 00:37:41.162
What, are you a doctor now?

589
00:37:41.229 --> 00:37:42.663
She's gonna fucking die, man!

590
00:37:43.798 --> 00:37:44.431
[Charm gasping]

591
00:37:44.498 --> 00:37:46.399
Shit. The power transfer switch.

592
00:37:46.466 --> 00:37:48.536
Oh great, the power transfer
switch. That's lovely.

593
00:37:48.603 --> 00:37:49.269
Calm down!

594
00:37:49.336 --> 00:37:50.671
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

595
00:37:50.738 --> 00:37:52.907
We can't see shit and there's
a girl dying on the floor.

596
00:37:52.974 --> 00:37:53.875
I apologize for losing my zen.

597
00:37:53.941 --> 00:37:54.776
-Okay.
-You, you have

598
00:37:54.842 --> 00:37:56.343
like a, a backup
generator or something?

599
00:37:56.409 --> 00:37:57.745
No, it should have kicked on.

600
00:37:57.812 --> 00:37:58.946
Flashlights?

601
00:37:59.013 --> 00:38:00.347
[Charm gasping]

602
00:38:00.413 --> 00:38:04.384
Yes, there is a backup jenny
in the corner of the garage.

603
00:38:05.153 --> 00:38:06.286
All right, you guys take these.

604
00:38:06.353 --> 00:38:06.988
Go turn the switch on.

605
00:38:07.088 --> 00:38:08.122
What, why us?

606
00:38:08.189 --> 00:38:09.289
We don't know anything
about generators.

607
00:38:09.356 --> 00:38:10.357
Because I need to be
here with my daughter.

608
00:38:10.423 --> 00:38:11.793
Um, okay, he, he, he's right.

609
00:38:11.859 --> 00:38:13.261
Okay, we don't know
what we're doing,

610
00:38:13.326 --> 00:38:15.696
so why don't you take him
and I'll stay with her.

611
00:38:16.396 --> 00:38:19.867
-[Charm grunting]
-[Charm's body thudding]

612
00:38:19.934 --> 00:38:22.970
Okay, let's go.

613
00:38:23.204 --> 00:38:24.972
After this, team meeting.

614
00:38:25.039 --> 00:38:27.340
[Charm grunting]

615
00:38:29.342 --> 00:38:34.515
Uh, okay, just um,
[exhales] stay there.

616
00:38:41.722 --> 00:38:43.257
[Kory] S- so, uh, Charm's dad,

617
00:38:43.323 --> 00:38:45.425
is he, is he in the picture?

618
00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.762
I cut him out a long time ago.

619
00:38:48.196 --> 00:38:49.396
Doesn't stop him
from squirming in

620
00:38:49.462 --> 00:38:50.698
every now and then, but...

621
00:38:52.266 --> 00:38:56.637
[sighs] Shit. Can you
give me some light?

622
00:38:57.238 --> 00:38:59.941
[Kory] Uh-huh. [sighs]

623
00:39:00.741 --> 00:39:03.110
You know, I think the
whole body positivity thing

624
00:39:03.177 --> 00:39:04.812
is super hot.

625
00:39:07.815 --> 00:39:11.319

[eerie ominous music]

631
00:39:42.884 --> 00:39:43.885
Are you all right?

632
00:39:47.555 --> 00:39:49.456
Like, if you need help,

633
00:39:51.859 --> 00:39:55.963
if something's wrong,
like, really wrong,

634
00:39:58.633 --> 00:40:00.835
you just have to tell me.

635
00:40:01.102 --> 00:40:02.770

Charm?

652
00:41:22.049 --> 00:41:23.417
[Charm] Help me, Mama.

653
00:41:23.818 --> 00:41:27.855
O- okay, just, just, just
wait a second! You guys!

654
00:41:28.356 --> 00:41:31.559
[Liz breathing heavily]

655
00:41:39.499 --> 00:41:41.135

Charm? Can you follow my voice?

663
00:42:23.344 --> 00:42:25.246
[Charm] Can you follow my voice?

[Liz grunting]

665
00:42:29.984 --> 00:42:34.588
I'll go as far as I can, but
you're gonna have to meet me.

666
00:42:37.725 --> 00:42:39.927

Our Father Who art in
heaven, hallowed be Thy name.

I shall not want.

[Kory] We got you. Hey, hey.

684
00:43:51.999 --> 00:43:53.100
[gasping] Oh no.

685
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:57.338
There is, [gasping] there
is something out there.

686
00:43:57.404 --> 00:43:58.739
-What?
-Okay, maybe there is.

687
00:43:58.806 --> 00:44:01.642
There's a tunnel all the way
to your damn mailbox, okay?

688
00:44:01.709 --> 00:44:04.011
-Come here, come here.
-well, where's Charm?

689
00:44:04.845 --> 00:44:06.113
-Something was chasing me.
-Charm. Charm.

690
00:44:11.118 --> 00:44:12.086
Ice tunnel?

691
00:44:12.153 --> 00:44:14.088
Yes. Go look, I swear!

692
00:44:14.155 --> 00:44:15.990
[tool clatters]

693
00:44:16.056 --> 00:44:17.091
What the fuck?

694
00:44:17.158 --> 00:44:18.125
[Liz gasping]

695
00:44:20.394 --> 00:44:21.328

[door slams]

698
00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:32.306
Something is wrong here.
Have you been seeing things.

699
00:44:32.806 --> 00:44:33.941
With all the pills
I've been taking,

700
00:44:34.008 --> 00:44:35.376
I don't think I'm
seeing enough things.

701
00:44:35.442 --> 00:44:36.410
Look, I'm being serious!

702
00:44:36.477 --> 00:44:37.845
Yeah, and I'm
being logical, dude.

703
00:44:37.912 --> 00:44:41.650
Like, we're all tired and
hungry and fucking horny, okay?

704
00:44:41.715 --> 00:44:44.218
So I think some minor
freakouts are allowed.

705
00:44:46.353 --> 00:44:47.054
She drugged us.

706
00:44:47.121 --> 00:44:48.088
What?

707
00:44:48.155 --> 00:44:51.560
I was fine until we ate
and then, and then I, I,

708
00:44:51.626 --> 00:44:52.993
-I thought I saw.
-Oh, no, no, no.

709
00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:54.361
I ate the same thing you did.

710
00:44:54.596 --> 00:44:55.863
Maybe it's too
busy bouncing off

711
00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:57.398
all the other crap
in your system.

712
00:44:57.464 --> 00:44:58.633
Yeah, and maybe
it's like the time

713
00:44:58.699 --> 00:45:00.901
you saw St. Anthony
in the shower.

714
00:45:01.101 --> 00:45:02.803
Look, you want me to
concur with something?

715
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:05.973
I'll concur that Charm is a
few bats short of a belfry.

716
00:45:06.508 --> 00:45:09.109
Or is it too many bats?
It's too many bats, right?

717
00:45:10.077 --> 00:45:11.312
I think she's here
against her will.

718
00:45:11.378 --> 00:45:12.346
[Kory sighs]

719
00:45:12.413 --> 00:45:15.316
The, the seizures, the
door. It, it makes sense.

720
00:45:15.382 --> 00:45:16.283
No, it do-

721
00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:18.385
I, I talked to her, okay.

722
00:45:18.452 --> 00:45:21.956
She would've told me if she
was a, like a fucking hostage.

723
00:45:23.592 --> 00:45:25.926
It's my face. Makes
girls wanna open up.

724
00:45:25.993 --> 00:45:29.496
-Ugh.
-Don't. Hey, don't, okay?

725
00:45:30.231 --> 00:45:31.666
Your neurotic hunch
is gonna put us

726
00:45:31.732 --> 00:45:33.100
in a freeze-to-death situation.

727
00:45:33.167 --> 00:45:37.505
So you would ignore a
captive human to stay warm?

728
00:45:37.838 --> 00:45:40.040
I am disabled.

729
00:45:41.375 --> 00:45:46.847
Just [grunting] get some
rest, okay, Nancy Drew?

730
00:45:47.147 --> 00:45:50.484
We're hitting the slopes
tomorrow, no skis.

731
00:45:53.187 --> 00:45:55.389
You know, when
they delivered you,

732
00:45:56.625 --> 00:46:00.629
both of your lungs collapsed,
and the umbilical cord

733
00:46:00.695 --> 00:46:02.263
wrapped around your
neck was not helping.

734
00:46:03.764 --> 00:46:05.199
You weighed two pounds.

735
00:46:06.467 --> 00:46:09.336
When they tried to check you
out in the corner of the room,

736
00:46:09.403 --> 00:46:10.505
the power died,

737
00:46:13.307 --> 00:46:15.376
and I didn't know
what was happening.

738
00:46:16.176 --> 00:46:18.580
You know, I was so
disoriented from the drugs,

739
00:46:18.647 --> 00:46:19.913
theirs and my own.

740
00:46:20.649 --> 00:46:21.616
I didn't know what was going on,

741
00:46:21.683 --> 00:46:23.150
but I could hear them talking

742
00:46:23.585 --> 00:46:26.153
and they were talking about
you like you were already dead.

743
00:46:27.321 --> 00:46:29.524
And I knew that I
couldn't be there for you,

744
00:46:31.091 --> 00:46:33.060
that you would have to
be your own battery,

745
00:46:33.127 --> 00:46:36.196
your own safety, your own charm,

746
00:46:38.633 --> 00:46:41.636
but this time, this time,

747
00:46:41.703 --> 00:46:43.772
I'm here to pull
you out of the dark.

748
00:46:43.837 --> 00:46:48.442

[recorder clicks]

755
00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:12.099
The substitute compound is
making her more aggressive.

756
00:47:12.966 --> 00:47:18.807
I might have to, [exhales]
I might have to. Fuck!

757
00:47:18.872 --> 00:47:21.576
[objects clattering]

758
00:47:24.144 --> 00:47:25.145
Fuck.

759
00:47:29.718 --> 00:47:30.618
Fuck.

766
00:48:11.291 --> 00:48:12.259
Hello.

767
00:48:13.427 --> 00:48:18.098
Uh, uh, fuck.

768
00:48:19.734 --> 00:48:21.969
[Kory grunting]

769
00:48:23.003 --> 00:48:24.672
Just leave you there.

770
00:48:25.774 --> 00:48:30.144
Um, um, um.

771
00:48:32.714 --> 00:48:34.582
Oh, Jesus, you're the man.

772
00:48:35.983 --> 00:48:37.317

00:48:43.792 --> 00:48:45.192
What the fuck?

776
00:48:47.595 --> 00:48:49.163
Jesus Christ, Faith.

777
00:48:51.666 --> 00:48:52.667
What?

778
00:48:54.702 --> 00:48:56.704
Make the pain go away, my ass.

00:49:03.645 --> 00:49:04.411
Idiot.

[tense suspenseful music]

783
00:49:18.392 --> 00:49:19.393
Mine now.

786
00:49:35.342 --> 00:49:36.310
Okay.

787
00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:41.749
Shit, I got it.

788
00:49:42.049 --> 00:49:45.252

Sorry. [gasps]

Some, uh, [clears throat]

799
00:50:54.689 --> 00:50:55.690
it's a crazy day, huh?

800
00:50:56.624 --> 00:50:59.393
[Creature] Still early,
isn't it, buddy?

801
00:50:59.694 --> 00:51:02.931
Oh, oh, uh, you're, um.

802
00:51:03.297 --> 00:51:07.434
[Father] Charm's father,
man of the house. That's me.

803
00:51:08.468 --> 00:51:11.005
She didn't really, uh, she
didn't really mention you.

804
00:51:11.506 --> 00:51:15.610
[Father] Really? Sounds like
sour teenage grapes to me.

805
00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:18.111
[chuckles] Well, I wouldn't know

806
00:51:18.178 --> 00:51:19.847
I, um, I don't have any kids.

807
00:51:19.914 --> 00:51:21.683
[Father] Not yet,
but you got plenty

808
00:51:21.749 --> 00:51:25.019
of that pure white venom
just itching to get out.

809
00:51:25.085 --> 00:51:27.989
[inhales] I can
smell it from here.

810

[Liz gasps]

814
00:52:13.668 --> 00:52:16.169
You know, I never
apologized t-, um,

815
00:52:16.236 --> 00:52:18.706
to you for sort of
just dropping in here.

816
00:52:18.773 --> 00:52:19.741
So sorry.

817
00:52:20.041 --> 00:52:21.976
[creature whooshing]

[gentle tense music]

820
00:52:30.852 --> 00:52:34.856
I should go back to bed. So,
um, sorry to wake you up here.

821
00:52:35.523 --> 00:52:36.490
[Father] Kory.

822
00:52:37.091 --> 00:52:40.227
[Kory] Yeah? [gasping]

823
00:52:43.564 --> 00:52:45.767
[Father] You've got
something of mine.

824
00:52:47.234 --> 00:52:49.436
I'm sorry. I, I wasn't gonna.

825
00:52:49.771 --> 00:52:50.738
[creature chittering]

827
00:53:02.382 --> 00:53:03.818
[Father] Nighty-night.

00:53:06.721 --> 00:53:08.022

[nails scraping]

831
00:53:11.458 --> 00:53:13.761
[Kory] What the fuck?

832
00:53:14.696 --> 00:53:16.229
[door squeaking]

833
00:53:18.032 --> 00:53:19.399
Don't go out there.

834
00:53:20.001 --> 00:53:21.169
I have to see her for myself.

835
00:53:21.234 --> 00:53:23.203
Trust me, hey. It's not safe.

836
00:53:23.437 --> 00:53:24.706
Well, maybe she's
not safe, either.

837
00:53:24.772 --> 00:53:26.339
Who fucking cares?

838
00:53:27.274 --> 00:53:29.342
That sickening lack of
empathy for your fellow man

839
00:53:29.409 --> 00:53:31.344
is gonna come for
you tenfold, brother,

840
00:53:31.445 --> 00:53:34.716
so do yourself a favour
and get with the program

841
00:53:35.083 --> 00:53:36.150
before it's too late.

842
00:53:36.216 --> 00:53:36.918
Move.

843
00:53:36.984 --> 00:53:39.654

00:55:06.207 --> 00:55:07.542
Charm?

853
00:55:10.878 --> 00:55:13.881
It's me, Liz.

-[shutter clicks]
-[Liz grunts]

855
00:55:16.717 --> 00:55:18.753
-[picture whirring]
-Yeah, I know where you are.

856
00:55:19.587 --> 00:55:21.522
Come to stare at
the basket case?

857
00:55:24.759 --> 00:55:27.028
Old school. Nice.

858
00:55:29.931 --> 00:55:31.833
Literally been in
hundreds of those things,

859
00:55:31.899 --> 00:55:33.968
but I still don't
understand how they work.

860
00:55:35.102 --> 00:55:37.370
Photo chemicals are basically
popped like a pimple

861
00:55:37.437 --> 00:55:40.141
onto a positive sheet
when the exposure exits.

862
00:55:40.842 --> 00:55:43.044
After that,
what you see is what you get

863
00:55:45.445 --> 00:55:46.914
or what you thought you saw.

864
00:55:48.716 --> 00:55:52.820
Mystery solved.
I brought you these.

865
00:55:53.621 --> 00:55:59.660
Th- they're very striking.
Thought you might want them.

866
00:56:02.964 --> 00:56:03.965
Liz, right?

867
00:56:07.869 --> 00:56:12.073
Last time I checked, there's
only one copy of that key.

868
00:56:15.543 --> 00:56:17.111
I had to see for myself.

869
00:56:17.178 --> 00:56:18.411
See what for yourself?

870
00:56:18.746 --> 00:56:21.082
That you weren't
here against your will.

871
00:56:21.916 --> 00:56:26.554
The seizure, the door,
the, the, the tunnel.

872
00:56:28.856 --> 00:56:29.824
The tunnel.

873
00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:33.628
Take my picture.

874
00:56:39.567 --> 00:56:40.768
Your home is odd.

875
00:56:42.435 --> 00:56:44.071
I've been keeping my eyes open.

876
00:56:44.939 --> 00:56:47.474
Usually there'll
be a sign somewhere.

877
00:56:48.209 --> 00:56:51.612
You know, a trinket, a symbol.

878
00:56:52.246 --> 00:56:53.446
Some evidence of-

879
00:56:53.514 --> 00:56:54.348
Evidence of what?

880
00:56:54.615 --> 00:57:00.487
-[shutter clicks]
-[picture whirring]

881
00:57:01.889 --> 00:57:02.890
Faith.

882
00:57:04.125 --> 00:57:11.532
Hmm. Value judgements from
the home invader, hmm?

883
00:57:13.067 --> 00:57:14.201
I'm sorry. I just...

884
00:57:18.606 --> 00:57:20.708
I- is there something

885
00:57:21.676 --> 00:57:25.212
that you wanna tell me
about your mother?

886
00:57:27.748 --> 00:57:31.118
I've seen situations
like this before.

887
00:57:31.886 --> 00:57:34.922
This isn't how real
protection works.

888
00:57:37.692 --> 00:57:38.859
What's there to tell?

889
00:57:40.895 --> 00:57:42.563
My mom thinks I
turn into a monster

890
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:44.565
if I get too hot or too cold.

891
00:57:46.867 --> 00:57:47.835

that 10% is what we
use of our brains

1000

and that full capacity
operation could be the result

1001
