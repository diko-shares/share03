00:01:25.316 --> 00:01:27.592
<i>Some guys
are all about the drink.</i>

00:01:27.622 --> 00:01:30.593
<i>Some like to laugh it up
with the boys all night.</i>

5
00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:32.364
<i>And some guys like to brawl.</i>

6
00:01:35.437 --> 00:01:38.075
<i>Some guys,
they like all that shit.</i>

7
00:01:38.105 --> 00:01:40.715
<i>Me, I'm one of those guys.</i>

8
00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:45.796
<i>Big fucker punching me</i>

9
00:01:45.826 --> 00:01:47.567
<i>is what they call
an up-and-comer.</i>

10
00:01:47.597 --> 00:01:48.897
<i>The world will know him
as the guy</i>

11
00:01:48.927 --> 00:01:51.101
<i>who sold the hamburger grill
on TV.</i>

12
00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:53.077
<i>His name is George Foreman</i>

13
00:01:53.107 --> 00:01:54.647
<i>and he'd hit
like a ton of bricks</i>

14
00:01:54.677 --> 00:01:56.480
<i>falling off a rooftop
right on your head.</i>

15
00:01:57.817 --> 00:02:00.626
<i>The motivational speaker
was Al Braverman.</i>

16
00:02:00.656 --> 00:02:03.397
<i>He didn't know
the meaning of sugarcoating.</i>

17
00:02:03.427 --> 00:02:05.837
<i>But I gotta say,
I wouldn't step in the ring</i>

18
00:02:05.867 --> 00:02:07.903
<i>if I didn't know Al
wasn't gonna be in my corner.</i>

19
00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:10.575
You're fucking blowing it,
you understand? Blowing it.

20
00:02:10.605 --> 00:02:12.077
Keep your fucking mitts up.

21
00:02:12.107 --> 00:02:15.885
Use them to block the punches
instead of your fucking face.

22
00:02:15.915 --> 00:02:17.891
I can beat this guy, Al.

23
00:02:20.597 --> 00:02:22.571
<i>I was the toughest kid
in Bayonne.</i>

24
00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:24.569
<i>No one wanted
to go two rounds with me,</i>

25
00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.106
<i>especially in a smoker.</i>

26
00:02:26.136 --> 00:02:29.151
<i>They loved watching us
kids fight.</i>

27
00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:31.150
<i>I was a hardheaded Polish kid.</i>

28
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.425
<i>I didn't take shit from anyone.</i>

29
00:02:33.455 --> 00:02:34.624
You really knocked
his block off.

30
00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:35.731
Thanks.

31
00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:37.167
<i>This kid stole my bike once.</i>

32
00:02:37.197 --> 00:02:39.534
<i>I made sure he didn't take
anything ever again.</i>

33
00:02:42.074 --> 00:02:44.177
<i>So where does a kid go
who loves to fight?</i>

34
00:02:44.207 --> 00:02:45.450
<i>Where else?</i>

35
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.583
<i>The Marines.</i>

36
00:02:48.153 --> 00:02:49.756
<i>I was a brawler.</i>

37
00:02:51.226 --> 00:02:53.630
<i>And the Marines?
They liked brawlers.</i>

38
00:03:03.885 --> 00:03:05.458
<i>After the Marines,</i>

39
00:03:05.488 --> 00:03:07.124
<i>I figured I'd come home
and get a regular job.</i>

40
00:03:07.154 --> 00:03:10.068
<i>Problem was I ain't any good
at regular jobs.</i>

41
00:03:10.098 --> 00:03:11.571
How's the fights going?

42
00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:12.466
Going good at home.

43
00:03:12.496 --> 00:03:14.672
I'm coming up
in a couple of weeks.

44
00:03:14.702 --> 00:03:16.080
Don't forget me.

45
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.512
I want ringside tickets.

46
00:03:18.248 --> 00:03:19.588
Yeah, anything for you, Joe.

47
00:03:19.618 --> 00:03:21.085
This dirty motherfucker
owes us money.

48
00:03:21.115 --> 00:03:22.126
When I catch him,

49
00:03:22.156 --> 00:03:23.222
I'm gonna wring
his fucking neck.

50
00:03:23.252 --> 00:03:24.264
Let's rock 'n' roll.

51
00:03:24.294 --> 00:03:26.268
Let's go take care of this
piece of shit right now.

52
00:03:26.298 --> 00:03:28.300
<i>See, back then, anyone
who could throw a decent punch</i>

53
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.638
<i>in Bayonne went to work
for the Mob.</i>

54
00:03:30.668 --> 00:03:32.614
Where's my money, douchebag?

55
00:03:32.644 --> 00:03:34.151
Where's my fucking money?

56
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:36.183
- I don't have it.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

57
00:03:36.213 --> 00:03:38.320
<i>One of my favorite
side jobs was collecting</i>

58
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.191
<i>for a mobster named Joey G.</i>

59
00:03:40.221 --> 00:03:43.035
<i>Welching on Joey G.
was a real bad move.</i>

60
00:03:43.065 --> 00:03:44.265
<i>He was hands-down</i>

61
00:03:44.295 --> 00:03:47.010
<i>the scariest mobster
in New York.</i>

62
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.579
<i>That guy would gouge out
your eye over a nickel.</i>

63
00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:56.758
Joey, Joey, please,
let me explain.

64
00:03:56.788 --> 00:03:57.732
Look at me.

65
00:03:57.762 --> 00:03:59.965
The last fucking thing
you'll be looking at.

66
00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.285
There we go.

67
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.339
<i>The Mob
was a mean to an end.</i>

68
00:04:17.369 --> 00:04:19.076
<i>Something to pay the bills.</i>

69
00:04:19.106 --> 00:04:20.773
<i>But I knew I didn't want
to get mixed up</i>

70
00:04:20.803 --> 00:04:22.049
<i>in that crazy shit.</i>

71
00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.712
<i>So I went back
to what I did best.</i>

72
00:04:23.742 --> 00:04:26.418
Get that motherfucker!
Come here.

73
00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.030
Get in. Fucking...

74
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.368
You fucking...

75
00:04:35.038 --> 00:04:36.739
Next time,
I'll fucking burn you,

76
00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:37.975
you motherfucker.

77
00:04:38.005 --> 00:04:40.886
I'll rip your fucking ears off!

78
00:04:40.916 --> 00:04:43.988
<i>But finally I settled in
to what I did best.</i>

79
00:04:44.018 --> 00:04:45.997
<i>What I was meant to do.</i>

80
00:04:46.027 --> 00:04:47.394
<i>I went to the only place
in the world</i>

81
00:04:47.424 --> 00:04:48.900
<i>that made sense to me.</i>

82
00:04:51.906 --> 00:04:53.913
<i>Sometimes, life ain't fair.</i>

83
00:04:53.943 --> 00:04:55.845
<i>All Foreman did
for three months straight</i>

84
00:04:55.875 --> 00:04:57.114
<i>was train for this fight.</i>

85
00:04:57.144 --> 00:04:58.923
<i>Me, I raised my kids.</i>

86
00:04:58.953 --> 00:05:00.022
<i>Worked two jobs.</i>

87
00:05:01.425 --> 00:05:02.965
Get your head out of your ass.

88
00:05:02.995 --> 00:05:04.329
Stop throwing wild punches.

89
00:05:04.359 --> 00:05:05.737
Use your strength.

90
00:05:05.767 --> 00:05:07.736
You gotta do defense
like we talked about.

91
00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:09.211
Defense? Fuck that.

92
00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:10.809
I gotta knock him out.

93
00:05:19.261 --> 00:05:21.165
Hello.

94
00:05:22.302 --> 00:05:25.010
All right, I'm up. I'm up.

95
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.808
<i>The only thing harder
than being a fighter</i>

96
00:05:26.838 --> 00:05:28.111
<i>is being married to one.</i>

97
00:05:28.141 --> 00:05:30.989
<i>They feel the pain
of every loss,</i>

98
00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:33.795
<i>but they don't get
the high of a win.</i>

99
00:05:33.825 --> 00:05:36.163
<i>After Liston, I was invincible.</i>

100
00:05:38.133 --> 00:05:39.339
Are you okay?

101
00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:42.212
Daddy's okay, honey.
Go get ready for school.

102
00:05:42.242 --> 00:05:44.210
- You don't look okay.
- I'm fine.

103
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.284
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

104
00:05:48.922 --> 00:05:51.464
Hey, get up.

105
00:05:51.494 --> 00:05:53.298
Mom made you breakfast,
remember?

106
00:05:55.502 --> 00:05:58.541
Would you look at that?
Jesus fucking Christ.

107
00:05:59.878 --> 00:06:01.147
He got you good.

108
00:06:02.216 --> 00:06:03.355
Does it hurt?

109
00:06:03.385 --> 00:06:06.122
- Yeah, what are you gonna do?
- What are you gonna do?

110
00:06:07.026 --> 00:06:08.595
I must be late for work.

111
00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:10.303
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

112
00:06:10.333 --> 00:06:11.900
You're really gonna go
to work right now?

113
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.378
- Are you joking me?
- Look at this dump.

114
00:06:14.408 --> 00:06:15.474
It's not big enough
for all of us.

115
00:06:15.504 --> 00:06:17.211
It's not a dump.
You need to lay down

116
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:18.480
and you need to heal up.

117
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.451
- Stop.
- I need to pay the bills.

118
00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:22.327
That's what I need to do.

119
00:06:22.357 --> 00:06:24.292
But what about the fight
and the money?

120
00:06:24.322 --> 00:06:27.231
That was, like,
a really big fight, right?

121
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:29.442
After expenses, it goes fast.

122
00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:30.608
Yeah, I know that.

123
00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:34.349
So why do you do it, then?

124
00:06:35.184 --> 00:06:36.956
You never win.

125
00:06:36.986 --> 00:06:38.293
What's the point?

126
00:06:38.323 --> 00:06:39.423
To look like shit?

127
00:06:39.453 --> 00:06:42.697
No, I don't get it.
I actually don't get it anymore.

128
00:06:42.727 --> 00:06:44.973
- Phyllis.
- I don't... What?

129
00:06:45.003 --> 00:06:46.543
- I'm sorry.
- This is what I do.

130
00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:47.439
Do something else.

131
00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:49.415
You're the one
who married a fighter.

132
00:06:49.445 --> 00:06:50.581
Yeah, so what do you think
about Chuck?

133
00:06:50.611 --> 00:06:54.493
- You think he's got a chance?
- Of course. He's tough.

134
00:06:54.523 --> 00:06:56.159
Of course he's got a chance.

135
00:06:57.329 --> 00:06:59.133
- He's real tough.
- Very tough.

136
00:07:03.341 --> 00:07:04.547
<i>Sonny Liston</i>

137
00:07:04.577 --> 00:07:05.677
<i>was the meanest
heavyweight champion</i>

138
00:07:05.707 --> 00:07:06.719
<i>who ever lived.</i>

139
00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:08.321
<i>He was also the toughest.</i>

140
00:07:08.351 --> 00:07:10.622
<i>He was the champ
till a kid named Muhammad Ali</i>

141
00:07:10.652 --> 00:07:12.023
<i>took away his title.</i>

142
00:07:12.053 --> 00:07:15.101
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh, my god!

143
00:07:15.131 --> 00:07:18.040
- Come on, Chuck.
- Are you serious?

144
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.312
<i>I should've known this
was going to be a bloodbath.</i>

145
00:07:20.342 --> 00:07:21.744
<i>Liston was knocking the shit out</i>

146
00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:23.781
<i>of sparring partners
left and right for weeks</i>

147
00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:25.690
<i>leading up to the fight.</i>

148
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.360
I hope his wife
ain't watching this.

149
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.658
Donnie, he's... Okay, call.

150
00:07:28.688 --> 00:07:30.262
We gotta stop this. Come on.

151
00:07:35.741 --> 00:07:37.410
Hey, we gotta stop this fight!

152
00:07:40.383 --> 00:07:42.023
Donnie, he's dying
right now, look.

153
00:07:42.053 --> 00:07:44.523
No, they're gonna kill him!
You guys need to stop this!

154
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.782
I can knock this guy out, Al.

155
00:07:53.812 --> 00:07:55.411
Look, if you keep
your b-heading, you gotta block.

156
00:07:55.441 --> 00:07:57.082
This guy's going right
for your face.

157
00:07:57.112 --> 00:07:58.286
He's chewing you up.

158
00:08:09.476 --> 00:08:10.414
I got you.

159
00:08:10.444 --> 00:08:11.278
- Keep on it.
- I'm fine. I'm good.

160
00:08:11.308 --> 00:08:13.153
How many fingers do I have?

161
00:08:13.183 --> 00:08:14.484
How many guesses do I get?

162
00:08:14.514 --> 00:08:15.391
Can you even see?

163
00:08:15.421 --> 00:08:16.689
I can see.
I'm fine. I can fight.

164
00:08:16.719 --> 00:08:18.425
We're gonna have
to stop the fight.

165
00:08:18.455 --> 00:08:20.329
- What?
- Al, I'm stopping this fight.

166
00:08:20.359 --> 00:08:21.538
Don't stop this fight.

167
00:08:21.568 --> 00:08:23.168
It's over. That's it, it's over.

168
00:08:23.198 --> 00:08:25.440
- I'm stopping the fight.
- Stop the fight.

169
00:08:26.477 --> 00:08:27.684
<i>You don't realize</i>

170
00:08:27.714 --> 00:08:29.515
<i>how banged up you are
in the ring.</i>

171
00:08:29.545 --> 00:08:31.086
<i>It's after that you feel it.</i>

172
00:08:32.156 --> 00:08:34.196
<i>I was banged up bad.</i>

173
00:08:34.226 --> 00:08:36.797
<i>Broke my cheekbone.
Shattered my eye socket.</i>

174
00:08:36.827 --> 00:08:38.703
<i>Tore me up for 72 stitches.</i>

175
00:08:39.806 --> 00:08:40.811
<i>He got me good.</i>

176
00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:42.575
- Stable?
- Heart rate's good.

177
00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:44.150
Blood pressure is good.

178
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:46.820
- You look like shit.
- Aw, thanks, doc.

179
00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:56.610
This big guy.
Come on, give me three.

180
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.279
That's what I'm talking about.
Kiss me, big guy.

181
00:08:58.309 --> 00:08:59.710
Hey, we got a good
nickname for your daddy.

182
00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.446
We're gonna call him
Zipperhead from now on.

183
00:09:02.384 --> 00:09:04.352
You know, when I was
watching that fight,

184
00:09:04.382 --> 00:09:07.627
I saw my husband getting
the shit kicked out of him,

185
00:09:07.657 --> 00:09:10.433
and living alone
without you in my life.

186
00:09:12.405 --> 00:09:14.780
It's not... It's not normal.

187
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.477
Phyllis,
what do you want me to do?

188
00:09:16.507 --> 00:09:18.651
I, I don't really want you
to fight anymore.

189
00:09:20.622 --> 00:09:23.230
<i>I was knocking
fighters out left and right.</i>

190
00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.302
<i>I had a glimpse of failure
which lit a fire in me.</i>

191
00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:28.709
<i>I knew one day I'd have
to leave boxing,</i>

192
00:09:28.739 --> 00:09:30.609
<i>but I was gonna go out swinging.</i>

193
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.593
You know, this kid
could be champ?

194
00:09:37.623 --> 00:09:38.790
Could be the White Hope.

195
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.566
- No, no, no.
- No?

196
00:09:40.596 --> 00:09:43.066
Don't get ahead of yourself. No.

197
00:09:43.096 --> 00:09:45.810
He's too easy to hit, you know?

198
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.549
<i>I fought my way
all the way into the top ten.</i>

199
00:09:48.579 --> 00:09:50.882
<i>I started getting noticed
by all the right people.</i>

200
00:09:50.912 --> 00:09:54.021
<i>I was about to be thrown
into the fight of my life.</i>

201
00:09:54.051 --> 00:09:56.293
<i>And my mom found out before me.</i>

202
00:09:57.096 --> 00:09:58.432
Oh, my god.

203
00:10:04.043 --> 00:10:05.617
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

204
00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:07.386
<i>the story we're about to see
is true.</i>

205
00:10:07.416 --> 00:10:08.483
<i>The names have been changed...</i>

206
00:10:08.513 --> 00:10:09.524
Hello?

207
00:10:09.554 --> 00:10:10.990
Chuckie, did you see
the newspaper?

208
00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.363
<i>No.</i>

209
00:10:12.393 --> 00:10:15.070
You're fighting Muhammad Ali
for the title.

210
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.371
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

211
00:10:16.401 --> 00:10:18.442
Ali? Mom, Mom, that's...
That's great.

212
00:10:18.472 --> 00:10:19.841
God, I'm so proud of you, honey.

213
00:10:19.871 --> 00:10:22.719
<i>Al Braverman got me
a title shot.</i>

214
00:10:22.749 --> 00:10:24.516
<i>This is what I wanted
my entire life.</i>

215
00:10:24.546 --> 00:10:25.688
Fuck, yeah!

216
00:10:42.823 --> 00:10:45.559
<i>Guys like me
never got a chance like this</i>

217
00:10:45.589 --> 00:10:49.406
<i>and I was gonna make damn sure
I didn't blow it.</i>

218
00:10:49.436 --> 00:10:51.739
- Ten-ounce gloves.
- 22' ring?

219
00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:52.780
22'.

220
00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.044
All right, good,
make sure it's 22'

221
00:10:54.074 --> 00:10:55.853
- 'cause I'm gonna be dancing.
- Yeah, I know.

222
00:10:55.883 --> 00:10:57.122
What you doing
eavesdropping on us?

223
00:10:57.152 --> 00:10:58.119
I'm not eavesdropping on you.

224
00:10:58.149 --> 00:11:00.494
I'm just waiting for Al
to do his business.

225
00:11:00.524 --> 00:11:01.592
You and Don are really giving me

226
00:11:01.622 --> 00:11:04.502
a great opportunity here
and I really am thankful.

227
00:11:04.532 --> 00:11:05.968
Stop flattering me, sucker.

228
00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:08.473
There's a nice waiting room
for you downstairs.

229
00:11:08.503 --> 00:11:11.451
All right, thank you, champ.

230
00:11:11.481 --> 00:11:12.916
- Good seeing you, Angelo.
- All right, you too, Chuck.

231
00:11:12.946 --> 00:11:15.492
You are in trouble.

232
00:11:15.522 --> 00:11:18.132
Hey, you're in trouble.

233
00:11:18.162 --> 00:11:20.164
What you talking about, Coach?
I'm the prettiest man alive.

234
00:11:20.194 --> 00:11:21.233
Take care of this.

235
00:11:21.263 --> 00:11:23.710
Man, what you talking about,
coach?

236
00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.475
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

237
00:11:26.511 --> 00:11:27.780
I'm champ of the world.

238
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.084
- <i>Ring size?</i>
- <i>22'.</i>

239
00:11:31.255 --> 00:11:32.524
20'.

240
00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:34.265
22', Al.

241
00:11:34.295 --> 00:11:36.965
Don King told me
you already agreed to 20'.

242
00:11:36.995 --> 00:11:38.969
We've been training in 20'.

243
00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:40.711
My guy likes 22'.

244
00:11:40.741 --> 00:11:42.843
What, he's coming to dance or...
or to fight?

245
00:11:42.873 --> 00:11:45.182
Look, he's coming to fight.

246
00:11:45.212 --> 00:11:48.054
If Don wants 20', 20'.

247
00:11:48.084 --> 00:11:49.930
Glove size?

248
00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.695
- Eight ounces.
- Ten.

249
00:11:51.725 --> 00:11:53.036
Eight ounces.

250
00:11:53.066 --> 00:11:55.068
You might want
an extra two ounces.

251
00:11:55.098 --> 00:11:56.939
My guy hits pretty hard.

252
00:12:00.047 --> 00:12:01.116
Nice.

253
00:12:02.886 --> 00:12:04.888
Come on, move
your feet more. Let's go!

254
00:12:04.918 --> 00:12:06.158
Yeah, he looks great.

255
00:12:06.188 --> 00:12:08.563
Get in there! Get in there!

256
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.705
Beautiful! Beautiful, champ!

257
00:12:12.735 --> 00:12:14.174
Right. Time!

258
00:12:17.249 --> 00:12:18.683
Come on!
You gotta work that off.

259
00:12:18.713 --> 00:12:20.253
- You look tired.
- I'm not tired.

260
00:12:20.283 --> 00:12:22.029
- You're not tired?
- Nobody tired.

261
00:12:22.059 --> 00:12:23.862
Ain't nobody tired.
I'm ready to go.

262
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.368
Hey, Al, did we get everything?

263
00:12:27.398 --> 00:12:29.044
Everything we hoped for.

264
00:12:29.074 --> 00:12:30.307
Al, what about ring size?
Glove size?

265
00:12:30.337 --> 00:12:32.680
24' ring. 10-ounce gloves.

266
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:34.822
24' ring?

267
00:12:34.852 --> 00:12:36.889
How'd you get Angelo Dundee
to agree to a 24' ring?

268
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:38.897
I lied.

269
00:12:38.927 --> 00:12:40.194
<i>This fight
was gonna be different.</i>

270
00:12:40.224 --> 00:12:42.198
<i>I was gonna make
a big enough payday</i>

271
00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:43.907
<i>to be able to train full-time.</i>

272
00:12:43.937 --> 00:12:46.139
<i>Believe it or not, the Ali fight
was the first one</i>

273
00:12:46.169 --> 00:12:47.909
<i>I ever got to train
for full-time.</i>

274
00:12:47.939 --> 00:12:49.785
All right,
back-to-back training.

275
00:12:49.815 --> 00:12:51.417
Let him dance.
He wants to dance.

276
00:12:51.447 --> 00:12:54.423
He wants to be a butterfly,
let him be a butterfly.

277
00:12:54.453 --> 00:12:56.432
Don't try to go
for the knockout.

278
00:12:56.462 --> 00:12:57.362
It's never gonna happen.

279
00:12:57.392 --> 00:12:59.032
- Come on! Come on!
- He's too fast.

280
00:12:59.062 --> 00:13:00.303
His reach is too far.

281
00:13:02.341 --> 00:13:04.416
- All right, Al.
- Body shot.

282
00:13:04.446 --> 00:13:06.015
- You're all right?
- I'm all right.

283
00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.464
<i>For the first time
in my life, I was ready.</i>

284
00:13:14.494 --> 00:13:16.406
<i>I was ready for Ali,</i>

285
00:13:16.436 --> 00:13:20.075
<i>and I was gonna show the world
I belonged on this stage.</i>

286
00:13:20.105 --> 00:13:22.282
Jesus Christ,
keep your hands up!

287
00:13:23.083 --> 00:13:24.456
That's it.

288
00:13:24.486 --> 00:13:25.726
Come on, dish.

289
00:13:25.756 --> 00:13:26.824
Finish with the left hook.

290
00:13:32.436 --> 00:13:33.972
Keep your hands up, Chuck!

291
00:13:36.778 --> 00:13:37.683
Put it up there.

292
00:13:37.713 --> 00:13:39.353
When you throw your left,
you're always...

293
00:13:39.383 --> 00:13:40.450
you're dropping your right.

294
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.491
Don't drop your right

295
00:13:41.521 --> 00:13:42.989
'cause you throw your left
and then you're open.

296
00:13:43.019 --> 00:13:44.030
You're open, right?

297
00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.460
So every time
you throw that left,

298
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.865
make sure you're keeping
this here and then salute.

299
00:13:47.895 --> 00:13:50.375
Go back.
You strike back but salute.

300
00:13:50.405 --> 00:13:51.445
I want you to salute.

301
00:13:51.475 --> 00:13:52.542
Every time you throw
a punch, salute.

302
00:13:52.572 --> 00:13:53.811
Like you're saluting.

303
00:13:53.841 --> 00:13:54.885
Keep that hand up

304
00:13:54.915 --> 00:13:56.252
because I can't hit you
that way.

305
00:13:58.155 --> 00:13:59.828
Are you preparing for Wepner?

306
00:13:59.858 --> 00:14:01.226
Well, I plan on bringing a mop
to the ring

307
00:14:01.256 --> 00:14:03.497
so I can soak up all that blood
he's gonna spill on me.

308
00:14:03.527 --> 00:14:04.872
Cassius, uh, Cassius...

309
00:14:04.902 --> 00:14:06.069
Ain't nobody answering
your question, man.

310
00:14:06.099 --> 00:14:07.510
It's Muhammad Ali.

311
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.276
- Get this guy out of here.
- You gotta go.

312
00:14:09.306 --> 00:14:10.580
<i>Ali wasn't nervous.</i>

313
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.989
<i>He should've been,
but he wasn't.</i>

314
00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:14.926
<i>He was always playing it cool.</i>

315
00:14:14.956 --> 00:14:16.223
He ain't got no chance.
I'm the greatest of all time.

316
00:14:16.253 --> 00:14:18.129
I'm the prettiest.
He can't possibly beat me.

317
00:14:21.503 --> 00:14:22.975
<i>See, Ali thought</i>

318
00:14:23.005 --> 00:14:24.307
<i>he was gonna mop the floor up
with me.</i>

319
00:14:24.337 --> 00:14:26.383
<i>He was out there eating.
Gaining weight.</i>

320
00:14:26.413 --> 00:14:28.081
<i>He thought it was gonna be
a cakewalk,</i>

321
00:14:28.111 --> 00:14:29.317
<i>but I knew different.</i>

322
00:14:29.347 --> 00:14:30.357
That's it.

323
00:14:30.387 --> 00:14:33.263
Always finish strong, baby,
with the left, yes.

324
00:14:33.293 --> 00:14:35.128
You got it.
Finish off with the left hook.

325
00:14:35.158 --> 00:14:36.999
I want to see
that double left hook.

326
00:14:37.603 --> 00:14:39.905
You know, they're calling you
the, the Bleeder.

327
00:14:39.935 --> 00:14:41.140
<i>My brother, Donnie.</i>

328
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:42.617
Stupid fucking name.

329
00:14:42.647 --> 00:14:44.615
<i>As many times
as I get punched in the head,</i>

330
00:14:44.645 --> 00:14:46.653
<i>I still couldn't be as stupid
as that guy.</i>

331
00:14:46.683 --> 00:14:48.923
Hey, you're a 40-to-1 underdog.

332
00:14:48.953 --> 00:14:50.933
Maybe I should place a bet.

333
00:14:50.963 --> 00:14:52.432
As long as you bet on me,
Donnie.

334
00:15:03.956 --> 00:15:05.630
Man, you look nervous.

335
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.300
You never been on national TV?

336
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.371
No, I never have,
but I'm, I'm doing all right.

337
00:15:09.401 --> 00:15:10.467
I just, you know,
maybe just a little...

338
00:15:10.497 --> 00:15:11.375
Ah, well, don't worry about it.

339
00:15:11.405 --> 00:15:12.271
Man, you ain't got nothing
to worry about.

340
00:15:12.301 --> 00:15:15.116
Piece of cake.
Done it a hundred times.

341
00:15:15.146 --> 00:15:16.953
Thanks, champ. I'll do my best.

342
00:15:16.983 --> 00:15:18.250
All right, now, when we get out
on that stage,

343
00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.388
now, I'm gonna need you
to call me nigger.

344
00:15:22.427 --> 00:15:23.265
Come on, now, don't act

345
00:15:23.295 --> 00:15:24.167
like you ain't
never said it before.

346
00:15:24.197 --> 00:15:25.164
I'm gonna need you
to call me a nigger.

347
00:15:25.194 --> 00:15:27.374
I don't... I don't think
that's a good idea.

348
00:15:27.404 --> 00:15:28.772
- I mean, I...
- Chuck, we gotta give the press

349
00:15:28.802 --> 00:15:30.408
something to holler about,
all right?

350
00:15:30.438 --> 00:15:32.212
I don't want you to be boring.

351
00:15:32.242 --> 00:15:34.285
Get with the program, now.
Come on.

352
00:15:35.153 --> 00:15:36.627
Let's do it for TV.

353
00:15:36.657 --> 00:15:40.066
Do it for Don King.
Do it for Great White America.

354
00:15:40.096 --> 00:15:42.265
Don't be a big disappointment,
Chuck.

355
00:15:42.295 --> 00:15:44.644
It's good for business.
Come on, sucker.

356
00:15:44.674 --> 00:15:47.080
I mean, I, uh...
Oh, all right, all right.

357
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.780
- It's going to be like that.
- Let's do it for business.

358
00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:50.187
How you doing, Chuck?

359
00:15:50.217 --> 00:15:51.485
I'm doing well, Angelo.
How are you?

360
00:15:51.515 --> 00:15:53.527
Very good, thanks.

361
00:15:53.557 --> 00:15:55.827
You know, this guy wants me to,
you know, say the...

362
00:15:55.857 --> 00:15:57.736
the N-word, you know, on stage,

363
00:15:57.766 --> 00:16:00.436
but I don't know if that's
a very good idea, you know.

364
00:16:00.466 --> 00:16:02.345
Do what the champ tells you.

365
00:16:02.375 --> 00:16:04.179
If he told you to,
would you do it?

366
00:16:05.081 --> 00:16:06.149
Yeah.

367
00:16:07.721 --> 00:16:09.359
Chuck, are you nervous?
You're looking good.

368
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:11.163
What, are you kidding me?
You think I'm nervous?

369
00:16:11.193 --> 00:16:12.795
I get punched in the face
for a living, all right.

370
00:16:12.825 --> 00:16:13.769
Hey, checking on the dress.

371
00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:14.799
What's going on, Chuck?
What's going on, bud?

372
00:16:14.829 --> 00:16:16.536
- Oh, I'm doing well, Don.
- Okay, all right.

373
00:16:16.566 --> 00:16:17.611
Good, good, good.

374
00:16:17.641 --> 00:16:19.408
Hey, look, give a good show
out there, all right?

375
00:16:19.438 --> 00:16:20.315
All right.

376
00:16:20.345 --> 00:16:22.319
All right,
don't fucking shuffle me, now.

377
00:16:22.349 --> 00:16:23.483
I'll beat
the fucking shit out, boy.

378
00:16:23.513 --> 00:16:24.457
I'll break both your legs.

379
00:16:24.487 --> 00:16:25.554
You'll be crawling
out the studio, okay, boy?

380
00:16:25.584 --> 00:16:27.558
Come on, I thought you were
over that jazz, Don.

381
00:16:27.588 --> 00:16:28.532
Yeah, no, no.

382
00:16:28.562 --> 00:16:30.235
- You have a great show, okay?
- I will.

383
00:16:30.265 --> 00:16:31.465
Yeah, we don't
get along too good.

384
00:16:31.495 --> 00:16:32.708
I heard about him.

385
00:16:32.738 --> 00:16:34.143
Uh, he's a white fella,
you know,

386
00:16:34.173 --> 00:16:35.642
he don't care too much
about colored people.

387
00:16:35.672 --> 00:16:37.880
Yeah, I... I heard
he called you Cassius Clay.

388
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.488
No, he called me something else.

389
00:16:39.518 --> 00:16:41.188
You ain't heard
what he said last week.

390
00:16:42.157 --> 00:16:43.326
He called me a nigger.

391
00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:46.530
Huh, I guess this is going to be
a real fight.

392
00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.735
I, you know, I did not say that.
I did not say that.

393
00:16:48.765 --> 00:16:50.171
It's on the record
to be straight

394
00:16:50.201 --> 00:16:51.273
that I did not say that.

395
00:16:51.303 --> 00:16:52.777
Here he is, uh, the challenger.

396
00:16:52.807 --> 00:16:55.253
Mr. Chuck Wepner,
welcome to the show.

397
00:16:55.283 --> 00:16:56.452
Thanks, it's good to be here.

398
00:16:58.356 --> 00:16:59.758
Oh, okay,
it's gonna be like that.

399
00:16:59.788 --> 00:17:01.834
Okay, so, uh, is there
any truth that you said

400
00:17:01.864 --> 00:17:03.605
- any of these terrible things?
- Absolutely not.

401
00:17:03.635 --> 00:17:05.469
- Yeah, he said it. He said it.
- Not at all. I did not say that.

402
00:17:05.499 --> 00:17:06.537
He said it just to show
his name.

403
00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:08.313
Hey, listen, you're trying
to be in my interview.

404
00:17:08.343 --> 00:17:09.477
This is my after one
interview talks.

405
00:17:09.507 --> 00:17:10.847
- Equal opportunity.
- You're boring.

406
00:17:10.877 --> 00:17:12.188
- You're boring.
- Oh, I'm boring.

407
00:17:12.218 --> 00:17:13.351
Nobody wants to hear you talk.

408
00:17:13.381 --> 00:17:14.560
Yeah, take your jacket off

409
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:16.290
because everyone's gonna see
how fat you are on the camera.

410
00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.567
Oh, you wanna do this now?

411
00:17:17.597 --> 00:17:18.697
Is that what we're doing?

412
00:17:18.727 --> 00:17:20.500
Guys, sit down. Sit down.

413
00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.241
Fellas, let's play nice.

414
00:17:22.271 --> 00:17:23.378
- Keep talking.
- Let's play nice.

415
00:17:23.408 --> 00:17:24.273
All right, all right,
I'm here any time you want it.

416
00:17:24.303 --> 00:17:26.551
- Have a seat.
- All right, here we go.

417
00:17:26.581 --> 00:17:27.920
Yeah, we're friends here, right?

418
00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:29.085
Tell me a little bit more
about yourself.

419
00:17:29.115 --> 00:17:32.390
Uh, I was, uh, born and raised
in Bayonne, New Jersey.

420
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:37.305
I'm a Golden Gloves champion.

421
00:17:37.335 --> 00:17:38.677
Champ, come on.

422
00:17:38.707 --> 00:17:39.773
A little respect to this guy.

423
00:17:39.803 --> 00:17:40.847
Can we get a chance to talk

424
00:17:40.877 --> 00:17:41.977
'cause I thought
they want to know.

425
00:17:42.007 --> 00:17:44.421
He knocked out a lot of guys
that knocked you out.

426
00:17:44.451 --> 00:17:45.618
Hey, I've never been
knocked out.

427
00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:46.854
I've been cut.
Never knocked out.

428
00:17:46.884 --> 00:17:48.295
This guy,
I'm gonna knock him out.

429
00:17:48.325 --> 00:17:49.760
That's right, no, you will...
you will try.

430
00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:50.834
You will get your chance.

431
00:17:50.864 --> 00:17:52.064
Oh, I'm gonna be there.
You better be there.

432
00:17:52.094 --> 00:17:54.002
- No, you're gonna be there.
- I'm gonna be there.

433
00:17:54.032 --> 00:17:55.043
I'm gonna whip the floor...

434
00:17:55.073 --> 00:17:56.311
I'm gonna wipe
the floor with you.

435
00:17:56.341 --> 00:17:57.380
I'm gonna wipe
the ring with you.

436
00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:58.745
Ain't no way in the world
you're gonna whip me.

437
00:18:00.083 --> 00:18:03.026
Hey, who's that silky bastard?

438
00:18:03.056 --> 00:18:05.832
- What, are you kidding me?
- Time!

439
00:18:05.862 --> 00:18:08.330
Sorry, Al. I'm on the cover
of <i>Sports Illustrated.</i>

440
00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.834
I got another cover for you.

441
00:18:09.864 --> 00:18:12.746
You spread-eagle on the canvas,
knocked out by Ali

442
00:18:12.776 --> 00:18:14.916
because you didn't train
for the fight.

443
00:18:14.946 --> 00:18:17.421
Because you're here entertaining
your idiot brother

444
00:18:17.451 --> 00:18:18.987
when you should be jumping rope.

445
00:18:19.017 --> 00:18:21.490
He's contending for the
heavyweight championship

446
00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.067
of the world and you're coming

447
00:18:23.097 --> 00:18:24.771
and putting this shit
into his head!

448
00:18:24.801 --> 00:18:26.067
You need to learn
how to protect my brother.

449
00:18:26.097 --> 00:18:27.710
He's in the...
in the ring getting beat up.

450
00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:28.640
Can you teach him how to move?

451
00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:29.775
You're distracting
my fucking fighter!

452
00:18:29.805 --> 00:18:33.555
Not my job. Maybe you
should learn to protect my...

453
00:18:33.585 --> 00:18:35.486
Donnie, I don't like it
when you're here.

454
00:18:35.516 --> 00:18:36.828
You want a new trainer?

455
00:18:36.858 --> 00:18:37.997
No, no, Al, I'm sorry.

456
00:18:38.027 --> 00:18:39.662
Then get that fucking moron
out of here.

457
00:18:39.692 --> 00:18:41.805
Get out of here, Donnie!
I'm sorry, Al.

458
00:18:41.835 --> 00:18:42.768
You know, he's my brother.

459
00:18:42.798 --> 00:18:44.845
Good, get on the ropes.
Three minutes now!

460
00:18:44.875 --> 00:18:47.116
This is the heavyweight
championship of the world.

461
00:18:47.146 --> 00:18:48.646
You're not gonna go in there
and knock him out.

462
00:18:48.676 --> 00:18:50.488
This is Muhammad fucking Ali.

463
00:18:50.518 --> 00:18:51.887
You're gonna hit body shots.

464
00:18:51.917 --> 00:18:54.759
You gotta concentrate
on his, on his weaknesses.

465
00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:56.769
And he doesn't have any.

466
00:18:56.799 --> 00:18:58.138
I'm taking this seriously, Al.

467
00:18:58.168 --> 00:18:59.769
I know it's a different
kind of fight for me.

468
00:18:59.799 --> 00:19:01.505
Yeah, that means
no drinking,

469
00:19:01.535 --> 00:19:03.445
no drugging, no fucking around.

470
00:19:04.882 --> 00:19:06.650
I have a responsibility
to be a leader

471
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.087
and so do you, Don King.

472
00:19:08.117 --> 00:19:09.423
That's right.

473
00:19:10.459 --> 00:19:12.000
That's why I take this serious.

474
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:13.163
It's not all about fun and games

475
00:19:13.193 --> 00:19:14.566
if you see me on TV laughing

476
00:19:14.596 --> 00:19:16.604
and cracking jokes
with Howard Cosell.

477
00:19:16.634 --> 00:19:19.582
He gets paid
to laugh and crack jokes.

478
00:19:19.612 --> 00:19:22.053
I get paid
to help my people out.

479
00:19:22.083 --> 00:19:24.859
You know, I'm not going to be
a politician for this country

480
00:19:24.889 --> 00:19:26.930
because this country hadn't done
nothing for black folks,

481
00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.066
never did nothing
for black folks.

482
00:19:28.096 --> 00:19:29.030
All they did was take us
from our land.

483
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.573
Why would I go over there
to the Viet Cong

484
00:19:31.603 --> 00:19:32.642
and kill all those people?

485
00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:33.739
They ain't never did
nothing to us.

486
00:19:33.769 --> 00:19:35.080
No, you're right.

487
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.784
You the ones...
You the ones that lynched us.

488
00:19:36.814 --> 00:19:37.719
You the ones that robbed us.

489
00:19:37.749 --> 00:19:39.016
You the ones
that went over to, to Africa

490
00:19:39.046 --> 00:19:41.827
where we was kings and queens
and you took us from over there

491
00:19:41.857 --> 00:19:43.960
and you brought us over here
for 400 years of slavery

492
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.531
and now you want me to sit here
and act like I love y'all?

493
00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:49.003
No, I do not love y'all.
I will not fight for you.

494
00:19:49.033 --> 00:19:50.812
I will help my black people out.

495
00:19:50.842 --> 00:19:51.909
It's always gonna be
black people first.

496
00:19:51.939 --> 00:19:54.787
I'm sorry, but that's just
the way it's gonna be.

497
00:19:54.817 --> 00:19:56.185
- You're right. We gotta fight.
- It's true, baby.

498
00:19:56.215 --> 00:19:58.055
We gotta fight for,
for our rights

499
00:19:58.085 --> 00:19:59.826
because that's what we deserve.

500
00:19:59.856 --> 00:20:03.171
We deserve to be
kings and queens.

501
00:20:03.201 --> 00:20:04.908
That's right, champ.
You're right.

502
00:20:04.938 --> 00:20:06.339
Maybe someday there
will be a black president.

503
00:20:06.369 --> 00:20:07.408
- Who knows?
- Oh, yeah.

504
00:20:07.438 --> 00:20:09.751
Maybe because I only helped
this poor white boy

505
00:20:09.781 --> 00:20:11.983
out in this fight and they see
that we can help them out.

506
00:20:12.013 --> 00:20:13.188
Amen to that.

507
00:20:14.124 --> 00:20:15.162
You know what, champ?

508
00:20:15.192 --> 00:20:16.795
You're the smartest fighter
I know.

509
00:20:17.898 --> 00:20:19.365
Well, let's try
to keep it that way.

510
00:20:19.395 --> 00:20:21.605
All right, all right.

511
00:20:23.342 --> 00:20:24.915
Now, we are all here
for the world

512
00:20:24.945 --> 00:20:26.046
heavyweight championship

513
00:20:26.076 --> 00:20:28.890
between Muhammad Ali
and the contender, Chuck Wepner.

514
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.694
Currently ranked eighth
in the world

515
00:20:30.724 --> 00:20:32.261
and they call him
the Great White Hope.

516
00:20:40.811 --> 00:20:42.212
That's it?

517
00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:45.725
- Here.
- This is the one.

518
00:20:45.755 --> 00:20:48.329
We're here at the
Cleveland Coliseum

519
00:20:48.359 --> 00:20:51.765
for the weigh-in
of the heavyweight championship

520
00:20:51.795 --> 00:20:55.945
between the champion
Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner.

521
00:20:55.975 --> 00:20:57.810
- Muhammad Ali...
- Yeah, I'm fat.

522
00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.888
You heard all about that?
How fat I am?

523
00:21:00.918 --> 00:21:01.857
- All right...
- Don't touch me.

524
00:21:01.887 --> 00:21:02.887
Don't touch me.
Now, you've been wigging...

525
00:21:02.917 --> 00:21:05.326
You've been jawing me
for a long time, now.

526
00:21:05.356 --> 00:21:06.400
One of these days,

527
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:08.370
I'm gonna take that toupee off
of your forehead.

528
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.069
All right, all right, let's...
let's weigh him.

529
00:21:10.099 --> 00:21:11.471
I'm on the scale.
I'm on the scale.

530
00:21:11.501 --> 00:21:12.780
All right.

531
00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:15.184
- 227.
- That is the official weight

532
00:21:15.214 --> 00:21:17.323
- of Muhammad...
- I, I am boxing.

533
00:21:17.353 --> 00:21:19.221
He's not fighting
the challenger.

534
00:21:19.251 --> 00:21:20.891
He's challenging boxing.

535
00:21:20.921 --> 00:21:24.837
He's challenging one 227 pounds.

536
00:21:24.867 --> 00:21:27.271
- Man, I'm sorry, man.
- That is six pounds heavier

537
00:21:27.301 --> 00:21:30.182
than when Ali
fought George Foreman.

538
00:21:30.212 --> 00:21:31.819
Man, there's
too much soul in here.

539
00:21:31.849 --> 00:21:33.216
<i>Everybody thinks
that the training,</i>

540
00:21:33.246 --> 00:21:35.453
<i>the time in,
that that's the hardest part.</i>

541
00:21:35.483 --> 00:21:37.363
223-and-a-half.

542
00:21:37.393 --> 00:21:39.233
You're too light.
You're lightweight.

543
00:21:39.263 --> 00:21:41.032
- And you're too heavy.
- That ain't enough for me.

544
00:21:41.062 --> 00:21:43.036
You need to eat
some more cookies.

545
00:21:43.066 --> 00:21:46.815
<i>But really, it's the
quiet before fight night.</i>

546
00:21:46.845 --> 00:21:48.781
<i>It's those hours
when you're thinking</i>

547
00:21:48.811 --> 00:21:51.458
<i>about everything
that led up to this.</i>

548
00:21:51.488 --> 00:21:54.464
<i>It's about spending time
with the people you love</i>

549
00:21:54.494 --> 00:21:56.198
<i>and praying
you don't let them down.</i>

550
00:21:58.804 --> 00:22:00.206
Why?
You worried about me?

551
00:22:02.912 --> 00:22:04.847
Of course,
I'm worried about you.

552
00:22:06.587 --> 00:22:09.128
I mean, you know he's got way
more experience

553
00:22:09.158 --> 00:22:10.459
than you and you know that.

554
00:22:10.489 --> 00:22:11.928
He knocked Sonny Liston

555
00:22:11.958 --> 00:22:14.138
out in one round, baby,
one round.

556
00:22:14.168 --> 00:22:16.106
And what did Sonny
do to you, hmm?

557
00:22:17.441 --> 00:22:20.150
He broke your fucking face
in half.

558
00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:21.416
I think I can beat Ali.

559
00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.456
I know you can.

560
00:22:31.036 --> 00:22:32.339
Baby, I got you something.

561
00:22:48.037 --> 00:22:50.078
Hey, darling. How are you?

562
00:22:50.108 --> 00:22:51.309
Hey, how you doing?
Good to see you.

563
00:22:51.339 --> 00:22:53.419
Good to see you, too.

564
00:22:53.449 --> 00:22:56.291
- Champ, good luck on the fight.
- I'm going to.

565
00:22:56.321 --> 00:22:57.293
How you doing, champ?

566
00:22:57.323 --> 00:22:58.924
How you feeling, baby?
How you feeling, baby?

567
00:22:58.954 --> 00:23:00.027
Come on, man, I'm the champ.

568
00:23:00.057 --> 00:23:02.236
- You know how I feel.
- Yeah, I know, baby, I know.

569
00:23:02.266 --> 00:23:03.701
So it's gonna be...
It's gonna be a great fight.

570
00:23:03.731 --> 00:23:04.942
I just can't wait
for this one.

571
00:23:04.972 --> 00:23:06.039
Well, that's the way
it should be.

572
00:23:06.069 --> 00:23:06.946
You know what I'm saying?

573
00:23:06.976 --> 00:23:08.176
You're gonna give everybody
a good show.

574
00:23:08.206 --> 00:23:09.050
Ain't nobody worried

575
00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.314
about nothing in this room
right here.

576
00:23:10.344 --> 00:23:11.484
Absolutely, champ.
You're all good.

577
00:23:11.514 --> 00:23:14.556
All right, Angelo, just make
sure you don't be uptight.

578
00:23:14.586 --> 00:23:16.994
<i>This was the biggest
fight of my life,</i>

579
00:23:17.024 --> 00:23:19.972
<i>where fate would decide
if I became a legend...</i>

580
00:23:20.002 --> 00:23:22.609
<i>or just another kid from Bayonne
who life kicks the shit out of.</i>

581
00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.664
The champ is here.

582
00:23:52.202 --> 00:23:53.471
Boo for me.

583
00:23:55.341 --> 00:23:56.978
All right, let's go.

584
00:24:06.231 --> 00:24:07.403
Round one.

585
00:24:07.433 --> 00:24:09.106
The bell sounds and here we go.

586
00:24:09.136 --> 00:24:10.743
Wepner comes bouncing
across the ring

587
00:24:10.773 --> 00:24:13.176
and looks as though he wants
to be aggressive right away.

588
00:24:13.206 --> 00:24:14.847
Ali known for slow starts,

589
00:24:14.877 --> 00:24:17.389
circling ever so patent
to the left.

590
00:24:17.419 --> 00:24:19.390
He'll try and convert early,
it looks like.

591
00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.395
Come on.
Now wipe this honky, Clay.

592
00:24:22.425 --> 00:24:24.098
<i>Let's not forget one thing.</i>

593
00:24:24.128 --> 00:24:27.210
- You're a bunch of turncoats.
- <i>Ali's a smart...</i>

594
00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.342
- Turncoats.
- <i>But he does put on a display.</i>

595
00:24:29.846 --> 00:24:31.385
Wepner will look
slow and awkward

596
00:24:31.415 --> 00:24:32.883
because he is slow and awkward

597
00:24:32.913 --> 00:24:34.587
but he does
seem to be hanging on.

598
00:24:34.617 --> 00:24:35.829
There we go.

599
00:24:35.859 --> 00:24:38.266
It looks like Tony Perez
has warned the lead

600
00:24:38.296 --> 00:24:39.865
about hitting behind the head.

601
00:24:39.895 --> 00:24:41.641
Ali cruises himself around.

602
00:24:41.671 --> 00:24:43.775
Took him on a flight
before this round's over.

603
00:24:46.145 --> 00:24:47.753
<i>Ali's hands are a little quick.</i>

604
00:24:47.783 --> 00:24:49.121
Yeah, he can counter so fast

605
00:24:49.151 --> 00:24:50.587
that it makes it difficult
for Wepner.

606
00:24:50.617 --> 00:24:52.657
This is a heavyweight
championship fight

607
00:24:52.687 --> 00:24:54.299
slated for 15 rounds.

608
00:24:54.329 --> 00:24:55.903
You had that one. Come on, baby.

609
00:24:55.933 --> 00:24:57.266
Can Ali knock out this man?

610
00:24:57.296 --> 00:24:58.303
Many people say no.

611
00:25:03.849 --> 00:25:06.625
The exhausted factor
as they go to round nine.

612
00:25:06.655 --> 00:25:08.327
Ali slips a punch to his left.

613
00:25:08.357 --> 00:25:10.830
Oh, a vicious shot to the ribs
of Muhammad Ali.

614
00:25:11.865 --> 00:25:13.839
And what a surprise.

615
00:25:13.869 --> 00:25:16.377
Chuck Wepner gets
to the body of Muhammad Ali.

616
00:25:16.407 --> 00:25:18.777
Let's see what happened here.
We're gonna count.

617
00:25:18.807 --> 00:25:21.716
Six, seven, and now a minute
into the eight count.

618
00:25:21.746 --> 00:25:23.524
Yeah! Yeah!

619
00:25:23.554 --> 00:25:25.725
You see that? You see that?
You see him? You see Chuck?

620
00:25:25.755 --> 00:25:27.427
Ali's gonna have
to get off his haunches...

621
00:25:27.457 --> 00:25:29.639
<i>I couldn't believe it. Ali fell.</i>

622
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:31.637
<i>For a second, I thought,
"If it bleeds,</i>

623
00:25:31.667 --> 00:25:33.613
<i>I could kill it
and maybe this guy</i>

624
00:25:33.643 --> 00:25:35.544
<i>isn't as invincible
as he says he is.</i>

625
00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.456
We got him! We got him!
We got him! We got him!

626
00:25:41.486 --> 00:25:44.669
Start the car, Al.
We're gonna be rich.

627
00:25:44.699 --> 00:25:47.503
<i>I thought that
for a second and then...</i>

628
00:25:48.708 --> 00:25:50.479
<i>Then he got back up.</i>

629
00:25:50.509 --> 00:25:52.546
Ali has horsed
around and horsed around

630
00:25:52.576 --> 00:25:55.588
and was warned
by his corner not to do that.

631
00:25:57.826 --> 00:25:58.826
Muhammad Ali went down

632
00:25:58.856 --> 00:26:00.932
from a vicious right hand
thrown by Wepner.

633
00:26:01.667 --> 00:26:03.303
Ali is agitated.

634
00:26:05.708 --> 00:26:07.314
He thinks this is for real.

635
00:26:07.344 --> 00:26:08.785
Nobody worried
about that, chump.

636
00:26:08.815 --> 00:26:09.949
You're the champ of the world.
He's nobody.

637
00:26:09.979 --> 00:26:10.789
I know.

638
00:26:10.819 --> 00:26:13.795
Do like what we worked on, okay?
Defense.

639
00:26:13.825 --> 00:26:15.994
Use your defense.
Keep your mitts up.

640
00:26:16.024 --> 00:26:17.666
Use the body shots.

641
00:26:24.781 --> 00:26:27.089
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

642
00:26:27.119 --> 00:26:29.021
It looks like
Wepner's in trouble now.

643
00:26:29.051 --> 00:26:30.062
He's staggering.

644
00:26:30.092 --> 00:26:31.626
Ali goes to work
with the right hand.

645
00:26:31.656 --> 00:26:33.668
Wepner's in trouble.

646
00:26:33.698 --> 00:26:35.907
Ali throws another
right hand right to the eye.

647
00:26:35.937 --> 00:26:38.139
There's a left hook.
Another left hook. Misses.

648
00:26:38.169 --> 00:26:40.048
Wepner continues to come on.

649
00:26:40.078 --> 00:26:41.685
Ali's final 30-second flurry

650
00:26:41.715 --> 00:26:43.455
won't win him the round, though.

651
00:26:43.485 --> 00:26:44.888
What a great round of boxing.

652
00:26:47.459 --> 00:26:48.663
He's in trouble.

653
00:26:49.898 --> 00:26:51.600
He's in big trouble.

654
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:55.013
Ali's not tired.
Wepner is tired.

655
00:26:55.043 --> 00:26:56.945
Ali has scored many more points.

656
00:26:56.975 --> 00:26:58.052
Come on, bro!

657
00:26:58.082 --> 00:27:00.786
I'm surprised knockdown so far
has been the scoring.

658
00:27:00.816 --> 00:27:03.059
That's my husband right there.

659
00:27:09.571 --> 00:27:11.512
Great uppercut by Ali.

660
00:27:11.542 --> 00:27:13.917
Wepner wants Ali so bad
he can taste it,

661
00:27:13.947 --> 00:27:15.849
but he doesn't have
the ability to do it.

662
00:27:15.879 --> 00:27:18.694
Ali does have
the God-given ability.

663
00:27:18.724 --> 00:27:20.197
Ali looked awkward that time.

664
00:27:20.227 --> 00:27:21.560
Wepner has his hands up
and says,

665
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.671
"Is that the best you can do?"

666
00:27:23.701 --> 00:27:26.204
Wepner's a tough kid,
there's no doubt about it.

667
00:27:26.234 --> 00:27:29.611
I have a tremendous respect
for the courage of this man.

668
00:27:29.641 --> 00:27:31.817
Ali has no respect
for his ability.

669
00:27:32.619 --> 00:27:33.892
Ali wants the knockout.

670
00:27:33.922 --> 00:27:35.662
He wants to knock him out
so bad.

671
00:27:35.692 --> 00:27:37.761
Ali trying to keep him
in punching distance now

672
00:27:37.791 --> 00:27:40.835
which tells me he wants
to finish this thing right now.

673
00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:49.251
Ali crosses with a right
to the dome

674
00:27:49.281 --> 00:27:51.561
and tapped the head of Wepner.

675
00:27:51.591 --> 00:27:53.259
Ali definitely wants to finish.

676
00:27:53.289 --> 00:27:54.929
There's a great combination.

677
00:27:54.959 --> 00:27:56.165
Wepner's ready to go.

678
00:27:56.195 --> 00:27:58.270
He's ready to go. Ali comes on.

679
00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.841
Wepner is staggering.

680
00:28:00.776 --> 00:28:02.244
He's on his feet right now.

681
00:28:02.274 --> 00:28:05.485
There's the combination.
Ali has his man in trouble.

682
00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:09.530
Oh!

683
00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.966
I knew it was too good
to be true.

684
00:28:16.141 --> 00:28:18.277
Come on, baby.
Get up. Get up. You got it.

685
00:28:18.307 --> 00:28:20.615
Wepner attempting
to hang on viciously.

686
00:28:20.645 --> 00:28:22.591
Wepner is out on his feet.

687
00:28:22.621 --> 00:28:24.289
A right hand off a left hook.

688
00:28:24.319 --> 00:28:26.794
Chuck Wepner, the count is up.

689
00:28:26.824 --> 00:28:28.670
<i>Four, five, six...</i>

690
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.903
- Ah, get up! Get up!
- <i>...seven, eight.</i>

691
00:28:30.933 --> 00:28:32.578
<i>The referee stops the fight.</i>

692
00:28:32.608 --> 00:28:34.644
<i>It will be scored
as a technical knockout.</i>

693
00:28:34.674 --> 00:28:37.752
Muhammad Ali retains
the heavyweight championship.

694
00:28:43.129 --> 00:28:44.803
<i>In that moment
right there,</i>

695
00:28:44.833 --> 00:28:47.642
<i>I knew that fight with Ali
didn't end up in a loss.</i>

696
00:28:47.672 --> 00:28:50.782
<i>See, people from all over knew
that a nobody from Bayonne</i>

697
00:28:50.812 --> 00:28:52.346
<i>went the distance with the champ</i>

698
00:28:52.376 --> 00:28:54.219
<i>and that meant more to me
than anything.</i>

699
00:29:24.113 --> 00:29:27.184
<i>I'd gone 15 rounds with
the champion of the world.</i>

700
00:29:27.214 --> 00:29:29.228
<i>I wasn't a nobody now.</i>

701
00:29:29.258 --> 00:29:30.793
<i>I was a somebody.</i>

702
00:29:45.925 --> 00:29:47.962
Should I go to his room
or is he coming here?

703
00:29:49.164 --> 00:29:50.334
Very funny.

704
00:29:52.538 --> 00:29:54.142
You fought your ass off.

705
00:29:55.511 --> 00:29:56.980
You really did.

706
00:30:05.231 --> 00:30:07.134
It looks great on you,
by the way.

707
00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:09.873
Who cares?

708
00:30:12.446 --> 00:30:14.348
So you're gonna be a movie star?

709
00:30:14.378 --> 00:30:16.490
A movie star?

710
00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.328
He's too ugly
to be a movie star.

711
00:30:18.358 --> 00:30:19.396
Very funny, Donnie.

712
00:30:19.426 --> 00:30:20.360
It was kind of funny.

713
00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:22.502
No, no, no.
Leave, leave Chuckie alone.

714
00:30:22.532 --> 00:30:24.301
Chuckie, tell me
what it's all about.

715
00:30:24.331 --> 00:30:25.843
What's it all about? You?

716
00:30:25.873 --> 00:30:26.912
Well, you know, they say

717
00:30:26.942 --> 00:30:28.175
it's based on my fight with Ali,

718
00:30:28.205 --> 00:30:29.378
but, you know, it's not me.

719
00:30:29.408 --> 00:30:30.920
Some, some actor's
playing the role.

720
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:32.484
Yeah, but it's some star
nobody knows.

721
00:30:32.514 --> 00:30:34.595
Some "Stallone-y"
or something like that

722
00:30:34.625 --> 00:30:36.158
- that's playing the role.
- Ah.

723
00:30:36.188 --> 00:30:38.565
"Stallone-y?"
"Stallone-y" baloney.

724
00:30:40.169 --> 00:30:41.576
<i>Fighting Ali was nothing</i>

725
00:30:41.606 --> 00:30:43.546
<i>compared to what was
coming my way.</i>

726
00:30:43.576 --> 00:30:45.049
<i>One night, I get this call</i>

727
00:30:45.079 --> 00:30:46.953
<i>from some movie producer
in Hollywood.</i>

728
00:30:46.983 --> 00:30:48.918
<i>He starts telling me
that they just made a movie</i>

729
00:30:48.948 --> 00:30:52.030
<i>about a boxer who I was
the inspiration for.</i>

730
00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:55.169
<i>It was a small movie
with an unknown actor in it.</i>

731
00:30:55.199 --> 00:30:56.506
<i>I didn't really care.</i>

732
00:30:56.536 --> 00:30:58.938
<i>I was just flattered
that they even called.</i>

733
00:30:58.968 --> 00:31:02.284
<i>But it turned out that movie
wasn't so small after all.</i>

734
00:31:02.314 --> 00:31:04.350
<i>In case you don't know
what I'm talking about,</i>

735
00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.426
<i>I'm talking about Rocky.</i>

736
00:31:06.456 --> 00:31:09.328
<i>It was amazing.
The movie was great.</i>

737
00:31:10.631 --> 00:31:11.737
I did.

738
00:31:11.767 --> 00:31:14.069
Who could've thought my story
would be so interesting?

739
00:31:14.099 --> 00:31:15.107
I know.

740
00:31:16.509 --> 00:31:17.550
Of course it is.

741
00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:18.545
Hey, yo, Rocky.

742
00:31:18.575 --> 00:31:20.656
Yo, yo, Chuckie,
how you doing?

743
00:31:20.686 --> 00:31:22.152
- Look who it is, man.
- Doing good.

744
00:31:22.182 --> 00:31:23.455
The real Rocky.
Here he is.

745
00:31:23.485 --> 00:31:24.664
This is my wife, Phyllis.

746
00:31:24.694 --> 00:31:25.761
- Hey, Phyllis, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

747
00:31:25.791 --> 00:31:26.928
Chuck, good,
thank you for coming out.

748
00:31:26.958 --> 00:31:29.439
- I appreciate it very much.
- Thank you for having me.

749
00:31:29.469 --> 00:31:30.737
Well, you know what, you know,

750
00:31:30.767 --> 00:31:32.340
Chuck is the inspiration
for this.

751
00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:33.381
Oh, thank you.

752
00:31:33.411 --> 00:31:34.449
Oh, Chuck, it's the truth.

753
00:31:34.479 --> 00:31:35.413
You know, I want
to say something.

754
00:31:35.443 --> 00:31:37.656
You know, watching
you fight Ali, you know,

755
00:31:37.686 --> 00:31:40.089
I always had <i>Rocky in mind</i>
but watching you fight

756
00:31:40.119 --> 00:31:42.126
just gave me that little,
you know, push.

757
00:31:43.264 --> 00:31:45.104
Well, uh,
whatever I could do to help.

758
00:31:45.134 --> 00:31:46.140
Are you kidding me?
Thanks, Chuck.

759
00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:47.270
- Thanks for coming.
- Thank you for having us.

760
00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.040
- It was a pleasure meeting you.
- Thanks for coming.

761
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:51.518
Hey, you guys
have a good night, okay?

762
00:31:51.548 --> 00:31:53.255
Let's go to Peter Luger's.

763
00:31:53.285 --> 00:31:54.418
- Really?
- Yeah, why not?

764
00:31:54.448 --> 00:31:56.322
- Do we have time?
- Yeah, we got time.

765
00:31:56.352 --> 00:31:57.329
Okay.

766
00:31:57.359 --> 00:32:00.330
I couldn't believe
how packed the theater was.

767
00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.036
Yeah, he's got
a pretty good movie, huh?

768
00:32:03.066 --> 00:32:05.173
Yeah, he does because of you.

769
00:32:05.203 --> 00:32:08.179
<i>And the winner is Rocky.</i>

770
00:32:10.252 --> 00:32:12.360
<i>In true fashion
like a great fighter,</i>

771
00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:14.164
Rocky <i>knocked out</i>
<i>the competition</i>

772
00:32:14.194 --> 00:32:15.662
<i>and took home Best Picture.</i>

773
00:32:15.692 --> 00:32:18.439
<i>In the end, it won three Oscars.</i>

774
00:32:18.469 --> 00:32:19.837
No, it won't happen again.

775
00:32:19.867 --> 00:32:21.479
I have a fucking policy

776
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:24.279
where people that are
fucking consistently late

777
00:32:24.309 --> 00:32:25.755
get fucking fired.

778
00:32:25.785 --> 00:32:26.691
You're fired.

779
00:32:26.721 --> 00:32:29.089
Get your shit
and get the fuck out now.

780
00:32:29.119 --> 00:32:31.797
Get out of my fucking club now!

781
00:32:32.799 --> 00:32:34.071
Hey, John.

782
00:32:34.101 --> 00:32:35.502
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hey!

783
00:32:35.532 --> 00:32:36.677
Hey, Rocky!

784
00:32:36.707 --> 00:32:38.180
<i>Everybody in Jersey knew</i>

785
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:39.845
<i>I was the guy
that inspired Rocky.</i>

786
00:32:39.875 --> 00:32:42.817
<i>I was like a celebrity
going to all these parties</i>

787
00:32:42.847 --> 00:32:45.327
<i>and nobody threw a party
like Artie Stock.</i>

788
00:32:45.357 --> 00:32:46.865
He runs the whole Boardwalk.

789
00:32:46.895 --> 00:32:49.202
If you need anything,
you just ask, all right?

790
00:32:49.232 --> 00:32:50.834
You want some booze
or some girls?

791
00:32:50.864 --> 00:32:51.742
Anything else?

792
00:32:51.772 --> 00:32:54.279
I want you guys
to have a good time, okay?

793
00:32:54.309 --> 00:32:55.348
Well, we got booze.

794
00:32:55.378 --> 00:32:56.445
Let's see some girls.

795
00:32:56.475 --> 00:32:57.486
Hey, Roger!

796
00:32:57.516 --> 00:32:59.323
You are Chuck Wepner.

797
00:32:59.353 --> 00:33:01.656
Yo, that's Amy and that's Sandy.

798
00:33:01.686 --> 00:33:04.261
You like brunettes? Or redheads?

799
00:33:04.291 --> 00:33:06.404
I like all women.

800
00:33:06.434 --> 00:33:08.742
<i>This was the life
I dreamed about.</i>

801
00:33:08.772 --> 00:33:11.308
<i>As a kid, I never thought
in a million years</i>

802
00:33:11.338 --> 00:33:13.615
<i>that I'd be living it up
like this.</i>

803
00:33:34.557 --> 00:33:37.333
<i>Yeah, I heard about
this cocaine shit.</i>

804
00:33:37.363 --> 00:33:39.365
<i>Now it was right in front of me.</i>

805
00:33:39.395 --> 00:33:40.842
<i>So what did I do?</i>

806
00:33:40.872 --> 00:33:43.547
<i>I shoved that shit right up
my nose and I loved it.</i>

807
00:33:43.577 --> 00:33:45.715
<i>It made me feel like
a fucking superhuman.</i>

808
00:34:12.569 --> 00:34:14.409
Whoa!

809
00:34:14.439 --> 00:34:19.414
This blow could rock the size
of a fucking, uh, pornographer.

810
00:34:19.444 --> 00:34:20.455
Oh, yeah.

811
00:34:20.485 --> 00:34:21.692
You're a fighter.

812
00:34:21.722 --> 00:34:23.796
You gotta fight
two or three times a year.

813
00:34:23.826 --> 00:34:24.960
There's a lot of guys out there

814
00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:26.562
that you could be
making money with.

815
00:34:26.592 --> 00:34:28.332
And he deserves
more money!

816
00:34:28.362 --> 00:34:29.775
'Cause you know why?

817
00:34:29.805 --> 00:34:32.107
Because he's one
of the best there is, man!

818
00:34:32.137 --> 00:34:35.486
He got Muhammad Ali
down on the canvas!

819
00:34:35.516 --> 00:34:39.427
And if it wasn't for the referee
counting so goddamn slow

820
00:34:39.457 --> 00:34:42.935
on purpose, he would've been
the champion of the world!

821
00:34:42.965 --> 00:34:44.700
And, to me, he definitely is.

822
00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:46.341
I know who you are.

823
00:34:46.371 --> 00:34:48.610
You're the guy
who knocked out Ali.

824
00:34:54.021 --> 00:34:55.928
Where's your brother?

825
00:34:55.958 --> 00:34:57.726
How would I know
where my brother is?

826
00:34:57.756 --> 00:34:59.969
I'm, I'm sure he's training
or something.

827
00:34:59.999 --> 00:35:01.868
Ain't it kind of late
to be training?

828
00:35:01.898 --> 00:35:03.744
He could be anywhere.
He's out there.

829
00:35:03.774 --> 00:35:05.008
I told you I'd go look for him.

830
00:35:05.038 --> 00:35:06.415
So 'cause he's popular
right now,

831
00:35:06.445 --> 00:35:07.512
I don't get to know where he is?

832
00:35:07.542 --> 00:35:08.650
Where the fuck is my husband?

833
00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.434
I ain't fucking around anymore.

834
00:35:15.464 --> 00:35:17.538
If you don't tell me right now,
both of you guys

835
00:35:17.568 --> 00:35:18.636
get the fuck out of my house.

836
00:35:18.666 --> 00:35:20.907
Why don't you take this shit up
with your husband

837
00:35:20.937 --> 00:35:23.545
and leave me the fuck alone,
all right?

838
00:35:23.575 --> 00:35:26.489
You guys are both
fucking bullshit.

839
00:35:26.519 --> 00:35:28.695
- Tsk, unreal.
- Fucking problem

840
00:35:28.725 --> 00:35:30.525
'cause you stick your nose
into every fucking problem,

841
00:35:30.555 --> 00:35:32.971
and you created
this fucking crazy bitch.

842
00:35:33.001 --> 00:35:34.908
What the... What's your problem?

843
00:35:34.938 --> 00:35:36.205
You want to blame me?

844
00:35:36.235 --> 00:35:38.011
Blame your fucking brother.

845
00:35:39.146 --> 00:35:41.816
Fuck this shit. Aye, fucking A.

846
00:35:44.758 --> 00:35:49.037
You gotta slow down
with the chasing the skirts.

847
00:35:49.067 --> 00:35:50.902
Come on, Donnie, don't go
and Quaker on me,

848
00:35:50.932 --> 00:35:52.038
you fucking square.

849
00:35:52.068 --> 00:35:54.214
The fuck are you talking about?

850
00:35:54.244 --> 00:35:56.953
You, you didn't have to deal
with her shit

851
00:35:56.983 --> 00:35:58.887
and my girl's shit last night.
I did.

852
00:36:00.657 --> 00:36:02.224
Well, that's your problem
right there, Donnie.

853
00:36:02.254 --> 00:36:03.226
Your girl's got your impact.

854
00:36:03.256 --> 00:36:07.675
I ain't got problems, bro.
You got problems.

855
00:36:07.705 --> 00:36:09.845
I want you
to be fucking serious

856
00:36:09.875 --> 00:36:12.047
for one time
in your whole fucking life.

857
00:36:14.585 --> 00:36:15.959
Do me a favor.

858
00:36:15.989 --> 00:36:18.828
Just be a little more
fucking discreet, will you?

859
00:36:21.566 --> 00:36:22.734
- <i>Here.</i>
- <i>Thank you.</i>

860
00:36:22.764 --> 00:36:25.273
All right, what about number 26?

861
00:36:26.109 --> 00:36:27.511
Uh...

862
00:36:28.714 --> 00:36:31.123
- Theodore Roosevelt.
- Yes.

863
00:36:31.153 --> 00:36:33.794
I think you're gonna ace
this one.

864
00:36:33.824 --> 00:36:35.527
What do you guys want to drink?

865
00:36:42.375 --> 00:36:43.715
Hello?

866
00:36:43.745 --> 00:36:44.951
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

867
00:36:44.981 --> 00:36:46.250
Do you know what time it is?

868
00:36:47.152 --> 00:36:49.189
Sorry. I know it's late.

869
00:36:50.124 --> 00:36:51.726
I won tonight, though.

870
00:36:51.756 --> 00:36:53.335
Where are you?

871
00:36:53.365 --> 00:36:55.004
<i>Uh, a hotel
in North Bergen.</i>

872
00:36:55.034 --> 00:36:57.003
I didn't want to drive home.
I wasn't feeling so good.

873
00:36:57.033 --> 00:36:58.406
Well, then you should be home,
Chuck.

874
00:37:01.114 --> 00:37:02.583
I'm pretty tired.

875
00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:04.988
Good night, honey.

876
00:37:07.694 --> 00:37:10.998
<i>I was in a constant
rotation of fighting, fucking,</i>

877
00:37:11.028 --> 00:37:12.374
<i>and doing blow.</i>

878
00:37:12.404 --> 00:37:14.675
<i>Life after Rocky
was like an endless night out.</i>

879
00:37:37.822 --> 00:37:39.124
Thank you, baby.

880
00:37:40.761 --> 00:37:43.237
Nah, it's just I always
get shit at home.

881
00:37:43.267 --> 00:37:44.800
Everyone's always busting
my balls.

882
00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:47.778
My brother. Phyllis.

883
00:37:47.808 --> 00:37:50.045
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I love my kids, but...

884
00:37:50.075 --> 00:37:53.223
I don't want to break
your balls, Chuckie.

885
00:37:53.253 --> 00:37:56.426
I just want to do drugs
and fuck you all night long.

886
00:37:58.163 --> 00:38:00.237
Well, cheers to the groupies.

887
00:38:00.267 --> 00:38:02.002
Boxers don't have groupies.

888
00:38:02.032 --> 00:38:03.912
Rock stars have groupies.

889
00:38:03.942 --> 00:38:06.083
You ain't no fucking rock star.

890
00:38:06.113 --> 00:38:07.886
I'll fuck you
like you're Jimmy Page,

891
00:38:07.916 --> 00:38:09.153
but you ain't Jimmy Page.

892
00:38:11.557 --> 00:38:13.364
<i>It was a crazy ride.</i>

893
00:38:13.394 --> 00:38:15.864
<i>But like all good things,
it had to come to an end.</i>

894
00:38:15.894 --> 00:38:17.200
<i>Where have you been?</i>

895
00:38:18.438 --> 00:38:19.778
Out.

896
00:38:19.808 --> 00:38:21.481
Where'd you get that shirt?

897
00:38:21.511 --> 00:38:22.850
I bought it at a store.

898
00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.780
I've never seen
that shirt before.

899
00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:25.753
Where you've been shopping?

900
00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:29.431
When did you go shopping?

901
00:38:29.461 --> 00:38:31.168
I don't know,
I went the other day.

902
00:38:31.198 --> 00:38:32.270
I bought some clothes.

903
00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:34.135
The other day? You...
Oh, when you were training?

904
00:38:34.165 --> 00:38:36.172
You're fucking drunk.
Give me that.

905
00:38:36.202 --> 00:38:39.017
You don't need
to be drinking anymore.

906
00:38:39.047 --> 00:38:41.149
What, now you get to tell me
what I can drink and not drink?

907
00:38:41.179 --> 00:38:43.086
- That's what...
- I've never told you what to do.

908
00:38:43.116 --> 00:38:46.026
'Cause now, 'cause now
you're stuck with a fucking ball

909
00:38:46.056 --> 00:38:47.569
and motherfucking chain

910
00:38:47.599 --> 00:38:49.300
that's gonna make
your motherfucking life

911
00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:50.540
a living motherfucking hell.

912
00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:51.772
You know what,
you need to shut the fuck up

913
00:38:51.802 --> 00:38:53.441
- and we need to go sleep.
- No, I won't shut the fuck up.

914
00:38:53.471 --> 00:38:54.482
We can talk about this tomorrow.

915
00:38:54.512 --> 00:38:55.980
- You go to sleep.
- You're fucking all riled up.

916
00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:57.956
You're fucking insane right now.

917
00:38:57.986 --> 00:38:59.188
You've never been correct.

918
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.292
Then why'd you marry me?

919
00:39:02.322 --> 00:39:03.968
I was young?

920
00:39:03.998 --> 00:39:06.005
You were beautiful.
You were nice to me.

921
00:39:06.035 --> 00:39:07.604
You think you're nice to me now?
Are you nice to me?

922
00:39:07.634 --> 00:39:09.245
Is this nice?
Coming home to this?

923
00:39:09.275 --> 00:39:10.543
I mean, it would be nice
to come home

924
00:39:10.573 --> 00:39:12.485
and maybe, get,
like, a fucking hug.

925
00:39:12.515 --> 00:39:13.449
You know, maybe give me...

926
00:39:13.479 --> 00:39:15.224
give me a fucking kiss
when I come home.

927
00:39:15.254 --> 00:39:16.689
I did like you,
but you smell like shit.

928
00:39:16.719 --> 00:39:18.294
'Cause I was
at a fucking nightclub!

929
00:39:19.162 --> 00:39:20.234
You came home to what?

930
00:39:20.264 --> 00:39:21.666
Me sitting there waiting
for you?

931
00:39:21.696 --> 00:39:24.471
Can we go to sleep and talk
about this in the morning?

932
00:39:24.501 --> 00:39:26.143
What the fuck, Phyllis?

933
00:39:27.078 --> 00:39:28.278
You're fucking poison.

934
00:39:28.308 --> 00:39:29.987
You fucking piece of shit!

935
00:39:30.017 --> 00:39:31.385
- Close the fucking door!
- Kids, come on down!

936
00:39:31.415 --> 00:39:32.661
Shut the fuck up.

937
00:39:32.691 --> 00:39:35.227
Shut the fuck up
and stop fucking waking them up!

938
00:39:35.257 --> 00:39:38.305
Shut the fuck up
and stop waking up our kids.

939
00:39:38.335 --> 00:39:39.535
You're going crazy in the middle
of the fucking night.

940
00:39:39.565 --> 00:39:41.707
I'm not going crazy.
I'm very calm.

941
00:39:41.737 --> 00:39:44.718
So fucking what if
I fucking broke things?

942
00:39:44.748 --> 00:39:46.717
- I'm fucking pissed...
- Shut the fuck up!

943
00:39:46.747 --> 00:39:48.258
- Yeah?
- Shut the fuck up!

944
00:39:48.288 --> 00:39:49.288
- Yeah, fucking tell me!
- Shut the fuck up!

945
00:39:49.318 --> 00:39:51.464
You want to pack a bag?
Then fucking pack a bag!

946
00:39:51.494 --> 00:39:53.201
They're already all packed up,
up there!

947
00:39:53.231 --> 00:39:54.636
- They're all waiting.
- Shut the fuck up.

948
00:39:56.405 --> 00:39:58.106
- Fuck...
- Fucking...

949
00:39:58.136 --> 00:39:59.381
Do it.

950
00:39:59.411 --> 00:40:01.452
- Do it. Do it.
- Fuck you.

951
00:40:01.482 --> 00:40:04.019
- Chuck Wepner fucking knocked...
- Fuck you.

952
00:40:04.049 --> 00:40:05.160
Fuck you.

953
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:07.598
You know, maybe you could
wear that for me

954
00:40:07.628 --> 00:40:08.527
every once in awhile.

955
00:40:08.557 --> 00:40:10.164
You know, in fact,
maybe if I came home

956
00:40:10.194 --> 00:40:11.238
and you were wearing that

957
00:40:11.268 --> 00:40:12.639
instead of fucking screaming
at me.

958
00:40:15.679 --> 00:40:17.083
Sure.

959
00:40:17.113 --> 00:40:19.450
- I'll put this on for you.
- Put it on for me.

960
00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.524
And now what?

961
00:40:20.554 --> 00:40:22.796
I'm gonna still
motherfucking walk away.

962
00:40:22.826 --> 00:40:24.560
- You want to walk away from me?
- I don't give a fuck about you

963
00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:29.506
and your fucking stupid
assnasty blue fucking...

964
00:40:30.441 --> 00:40:31.815
Sweetie, please.

965
00:40:31.845 --> 00:40:33.183
- Sweetie.
- Can we just lie down?

966
00:40:33.213 --> 00:40:34.285
- Sweetie.
- You look so beautiful.

967
00:40:34.315 --> 00:40:35.382
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

968
00:40:35.412 --> 00:40:36.423
Come on.

969
00:40:36.453 --> 00:40:38.123
Did we get off
on the wrong foot?

970
00:40:48.311 --> 00:40:50.553
I'm sorry. I love you so much.

971
00:40:50.583 --> 00:40:52.185
I love you so much, Chuck.

972
00:40:54.323 --> 00:40:56.397
I'm sorry if I fucked this up.

973
00:40:56.427 --> 00:40:58.197
You broke my fucking heart.

974
00:40:59.233 --> 00:41:01.402
My fucking heart is shattered.

975
00:41:01.432 --> 00:41:02.540
You ruined me.

976
00:41:03.743 --> 00:41:05.446
You ruined our marriage.

977
00:41:06.849 --> 00:41:08.653
But you won't ruin my life.

978
00:41:10.156 --> 00:41:11.624
You ruined your own life.

979
00:41:11.654 --> 00:41:13.162
I'm going to sleep.

980
00:41:15.199 --> 00:41:17.403
I am so disappointed in you.

981
00:41:28.861 --> 00:41:30.166
Okay.

982
00:41:30.196 --> 00:41:32.806
<i>This hurt more than any jab.</i>

983
00:41:32.836 --> 00:41:36.847
<i>I'd rather let Ali beat the shit
out of me for another 15 rounds</i>

984
00:41:36.877 --> 00:41:39.313
<i>than have to see the looks
on my kids' faces</i>

985
00:41:39.343 --> 00:41:41.791
<i>as their mother packed
their bags.</i>

986
00:41:41.821 --> 00:41:44.261
All right, kids,
come on, let's go.

987
00:41:44.291 --> 00:41:45.696
I'll walk you to the car.

988
00:41:47.531 --> 00:41:49.335
Bye, Daddy.

989
00:41:53.544 --> 00:41:54.951
All right, Ron, be careful.

990
00:41:54.981 --> 00:41:56.248
Bags and everything, okay?

991
00:41:56.278 --> 00:41:58.391
- Phyllis.
- What?

992
00:41:58.421 --> 00:41:59.554
Phyllis, you don't have
to do this.

993
00:41:59.584 --> 00:42:00.528
You did this!

994
00:42:00.558 --> 00:42:02.861
You don't care.
I don't care. You don't care.

995
00:42:02.891 --> 00:42:04.332
It doesn't matter.

996
00:42:06.806 --> 00:42:08.207
Phyllis.

997
00:42:08.743 --> 00:42:10.647
Phyllis, please.

998
00:42:29.383 --> 00:42:30.953
Don't worry, bro.

999
00:42:30.983 --> 00:42:32.356
She'll be back.

1000
00:42:33.025 --> 00:42:34.460
I don't think so.

1001
00:42:37.769 --> 00:42:39.809
You know
what your problem is?

1002
00:42:39.839 --> 00:42:41.041
You're too hardheaded.

1003
00:42:42.477 --> 00:42:44.781
It's exactly why she left you.

1004
00:42:44.811 --> 00:42:49.489
You don't fucking listen
and you never have self-control.

1005
00:42:49.519 --> 00:42:50.628
Never.

1006
00:42:53.466 --> 00:42:54.737
Do me a favor, Don.

1007
00:42:55.906 --> 00:42:57.340
Anything for you, bro.

1008
00:42:58.812 --> 00:43:00.715
Shut the fuck up, will you?

1009
00:43:02.886 --> 00:43:04.727
<i>I need to get back to work.</i>

1010
00:43:04.757 --> 00:43:06.157
<i>I need to get my mind off</i>

1011
00:43:06.187 --> 00:43:09.030
<i>those taillights driving away
from the house.</i>

1012
00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:12.704
<i>The only thing that could get
my mind right was a match.</i>

1013
00:43:12.734 --> 00:43:14.777
<i>To hear those crowds again.</i>

1014
00:43:20.487 --> 00:43:21.990
<i>So how do you follow up a fight</i>

1015
00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:24.194
<i>against the most famous boxer
who ever lived?</i>

1016
00:43:24.224 --> 00:43:26.572
Holy shit.

1017
00:43:26.602 --> 00:43:30.478
Well, yeah, the guy's big,
but he's slow as shit.

1018
00:43:30.508 --> 00:43:32.510
<i>If you're me,
you fight the largest wrestler</i>

1019
00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:34.721
<i>in the world at Shea Stadium.</i>

1020
00:43:34.751 --> 00:43:37.694
He body slams you,
we get the money and we go home.

1021
00:43:37.724 --> 00:43:39.393
Then it's back to real fighting.

1022
00:43:40.731 --> 00:43:41.596
There's no way in hell

1023
00:43:41.626 --> 00:43:44.074
I'm letting that fat fuck body
slam me.

1024
00:43:44.104 --> 00:43:45.911
He can throw me
through the ropes

1025
00:43:45.941 --> 00:43:47.141
or something, but that's it.

1026
00:43:47.171 --> 00:43:48.482
I'll talk to Vince.

1027
00:43:48.512 --> 00:43:49.479
No, you don't talk to him.

1028
00:43:49.509 --> 00:43:51.016
You tell him
that's how it's gonna be, Al.

1029
00:43:51.046 --> 00:43:54.195
All right, already.
Take it easy, Chuck.

1030
00:43:54.225 --> 00:43:56.026
<i>Now, look at
the difference in their size.</i>

1031
00:43:56.056 --> 00:43:57.735
Wepner is a big man,

1032
00:43:57.765 --> 00:43:59.867
a big man by any stretch
of the imagination.

1033
00:43:59.897 --> 00:44:02.077
232 pounds, I believe.

1034
00:44:02.107 --> 00:44:04.248
But a midget compared
to Andre the Giant.

1035
00:44:04.278 --> 00:44:06.518
Andre's not gonna be able
to move in the ring

1036
00:44:06.548 --> 00:44:07.619
against Chuck Wepner.

1037
00:44:08.754 --> 00:44:10.255
Pounding away to the kidney now.

1038
00:44:10.285 --> 00:44:13.166
Andre has him, but doesn't know
what to do with him.

1039
00:44:13.196 --> 00:44:15.735
The ref should get in there
and break it up by all rights.

1040
00:44:16.536 --> 00:44:17.806
Oh, baby!

1041
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:25.119
<i>See, you don't know
the true meaning of rock-bottom</i>

1042
00:44:25.149 --> 00:44:26.526
<i>till an overweight,</i>

1043
00:44:26.556 --> 00:44:27.758
<i>enormous European guy
picks you up</i>

1044
00:44:27.788 --> 00:44:30.134
<i>like a baby
and throws you around.</i>

1045
00:44:30.164 --> 00:44:33.102
<i>I was broke with no family
and getting tossed around</i>

1046
00:44:33.132 --> 00:44:34.911
<i>like a piece of trash.</i>

1047
00:44:34.941 --> 00:44:37.010
Got any more of this, baby?

1048
00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.618
Nah, that's it...

1049
00:44:38.648 --> 00:44:40.317
<i>I couldn't help feeling
like I deserved it.</i>

1050
00:44:40.347 --> 00:44:42.593
No more party favors,
no more party.

1051
00:44:42.623 --> 00:44:44.091
<i>I was just about ready
to tap out.</i>

1052
00:44:44.121 --> 00:44:45.594
Give me a Scotch and soda.

1053
00:44:45.624 --> 00:44:46.869
You're cut off.

1054
00:44:46.899 --> 00:44:47.904
You're cut off.

1055
00:44:47.934 --> 00:44:49.970
Just give me, like,
a soda with Scotch, then.

1056
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.874
<i>Then she walked into my life.</i>

1057
00:44:51.904 --> 00:44:52.914
Come on.

1058
00:44:52.944 --> 00:44:54.581
I'll take two waters.

1059
00:44:56.619 --> 00:44:58.793
Take it easy, slugger.

1060
00:44:58.823 --> 00:45:00.994
You get kicked out of here,
you don't get back in.

1061
00:45:05.136 --> 00:45:06.172
I'm Chuck.

1062
00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:09.142
I know who you are.

1063
00:45:09.172 --> 00:45:10.948
I'm Linda.

1064
00:45:11.782 --> 00:45:13.056
<i>Linda.</i>

1065
00:45:13.086 --> 00:45:16.696
<i>I swear,
she was sent from heaven.</i>

1066
00:45:16.726 --> 00:45:19.899
<i>That woman came into my life
just when I needed her most.</i>

1067
00:45:21.335 --> 00:45:22.803
You know, I think
we're going to be friends

1068
00:45:22.833 --> 00:45:24.039
for a long time, Linda.

1069
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:27.017
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah.

1070
00:45:27.047 --> 00:45:29.250
- Cheers to friends.
- Cheers to friends.

1071
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.326
- Do you like steak?
- I love steak.

1072
00:45:31.356 --> 00:45:33.965
Yeah, it's pretty tasty.
With, like, béarnaise sauce.

1073
00:45:33.995 --> 00:45:36.464
I don't know, I just like salt
on it and stuff like that.

1074
00:45:36.494 --> 00:45:37.734
You only like salt.

1075
00:45:37.764 --> 00:45:39.405
- This is me.
- Oh, is it?

1076
00:45:41.042 --> 00:45:44.347
Well, I, uh, I had a great time.
I really needed this.

1077
00:45:44.377 --> 00:45:45.385
Me, too.

1078
00:45:48.791 --> 00:45:50.960
- Good night, Linda.
- All right, good night.

1079
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:52.064
Okay.

1080
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:06.058
<i>While guys like me
were trying their best</i>

1081
00:46:06.088 --> 00:46:09.103
<i>to crawl out of the bottom,
guys like Stallone?</i>

1082
00:46:09.133 --> 00:46:10.334
<i>They never left the top.</i>

1083
00:46:10.364 --> 00:46:12.075
When will you make
another movie?

1084
00:46:12.105 --> 00:46:14.542
When am I making another movie?
I'm making one right now.

1085
00:46:14.572 --> 00:46:17.053
I'm making <i>Rocky II.</i>
What, you wanna be in it, huh?

1086
00:46:17.083 --> 00:46:18.217
- You want to be in it?
- Yes.

1087
00:46:18.247 --> 00:46:20.289
You want to be in it?
All right, I'll put you in it.

1088
00:46:21.391 --> 00:46:22.926
I want to be Rocky
when I grow up.

1089
00:46:22.956 --> 00:46:24.167
Wait a minute. Wait, hey.

1090
00:46:24.197 --> 00:46:25.464
You want to be Rocky?
What about me?

1091
00:46:25.494 --> 00:46:26.640
What about your dad?

1092
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:29.005
Okay, you want to be Rocky?
Okay, you got it, all right?

1093
00:46:29.035 --> 00:46:30.213
Listen, do me a favor.

1094
00:46:30.243 --> 00:46:31.348
Daddy gotta make a phone call.

1095
00:46:31.378 --> 00:46:32.512
Just be quiet
for a couple of minutes

1096
00:46:32.542 --> 00:46:33.887
- and we'll play, okay?
- Okay.

1097
00:46:33.917 --> 00:46:35.354
All right, play with your horse.

1098
00:46:41.532 --> 00:46:44.542
<i>I'd gone 15 rounds
with the champion of the world.</i>

1099
00:46:44.572 --> 00:46:45.572
<i>I wasn't a nobody...</i>

1100
00:46:45.602 --> 00:46:48.579
Hey, Chuck, how you doing?
It's Sly Stallone.

1101
00:46:48.609 --> 00:46:50.254
Sly, how you doing, man?

1102
00:46:50.284 --> 00:46:52.024
Congrats on all the success.

1103
00:46:52.054 --> 00:46:54.089
Hey, man, thanks a lot, Chuck.
I appreciate it.

1104
00:46:54.119 --> 00:46:55.498
Look, Chuck, you know,

1105
00:46:55.528 --> 00:46:58.136
I got this role in mind for you
in <i>Rocky II, okay?</i>

1106
00:46:58.166 --> 00:46:59.467
It's this experienced fighter.

1107
00:46:59.497 --> 00:47:03.009
His name is Chink Weber and,
you know, he spars with <i>Rocky.</i>

1108
00:47:03.645 --> 00:47:04.883
Chink Weber?

1109
00:47:04.913 --> 00:47:05.880
It sounds a lot like my name.

1110
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:07.584
Yeah, yeah,
it's kind of the point, Chuck.

1111
00:47:07.614 --> 00:47:08.586
It was written for you.

1112
00:47:08.616 --> 00:47:11.458
Look, all you gotta do
is come in, audition,

1113
00:47:11.488 --> 00:47:13.301
and the part's yours, okay?

1114
00:47:13.331 --> 00:47:15.238
- Seriously?
- <i>Yeah, come on, Chuck.</i>

1115
00:47:15.268 --> 00:47:17.577
You belong in <i>Rocky II.</i>
I wrote this for you.

1116
00:47:17.607 --> 00:47:19.508
- I'll be there.
- <i>My secretary will...</i>

1117
00:47:19.538 --> 00:47:21.144
<i>Sometimes those guys
at the top</i>

1118
00:47:21.174 --> 00:47:23.054
<i>throw a guy like me a line.</i>

1119
00:47:23.084 --> 00:47:24.558
<i>This was my fucking line</i>

1120
00:47:24.588 --> 00:47:27.093
<i>and I was gonna try my best
not to fuck it up.</i>

1121
00:47:28.128 --> 00:47:29.163
<i>Rocky II.</i>

1122
00:47:30.366 --> 00:47:32.340
<i>This was a night to celebrate.</i>

1123
00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:33.704
<i>I had inspired Rocky</i>

1124
00:47:33.734 --> 00:47:36.348
<i>and now I was gonna be in Rocky.</i>

1125
00:47:36.378 --> 00:47:37.680
<i>I was more excited
about this role</i>

1126
00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:39.415
<i>than any of my fights.</i>

1127
00:47:39.445 --> 00:47:41.959
<i>I was going to be
a famous actor.</i>

1128
00:47:41.989 --> 00:47:43.491
Ah, it's okay.
It's okay, sweetie.

1129
00:47:43.521 --> 00:47:45.032
- Fucking, yeah.
- Can I come?

1130
00:47:45.062 --> 00:47:46.430
Yeah, you can all come
to fucking Hollywood.

1131
00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:47.966
I'll open up a fucking club
out there.

1132
00:47:47.996 --> 00:47:50.005
Hey, Chuck, before we go,
let's get breakfast.

1133
00:47:50.641 --> 00:47:52.180
You want breakfast?

1134
00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:53.312
- Afternoon.
- What time is it?

1135
00:47:54.983 --> 00:47:56.152
I got a fucking watch.

1136
00:47:58.089 --> 00:47:59.322
Hey, champ, man.

1137
00:47:59.352 --> 00:48:00.665
What's up?

1138
00:48:00.695 --> 00:48:03.297
I think that train you're
supposed to catch at 7:45?

1139
00:48:03.327 --> 00:48:04.506
Yeah?

1140
00:48:04.536 --> 00:48:05.938
I think you missed it.

1141
00:48:08.477 --> 00:48:09.647
Oh, shit.

1142
00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:12.653
Your boy's late, Sly.

1143
00:48:13.621 --> 00:48:14.657
Yeah, I know.

1144
00:48:15.524 --> 00:48:16.627
So who's next?

1145
00:48:19.801 --> 00:48:21.102
Roy, get that.

1146
00:48:28.116 --> 00:48:29.591
- Hey.
- Stallone.

1147
00:48:29.621 --> 00:48:31.322
- Hey.
- You're late.

1148
00:48:31.352 --> 00:48:34.430
Look, we don't do
late here, Chuck.

1149
00:48:36.067 --> 00:48:37.635
Yeah, hey, Chuck. Listen.

1150
00:48:37.665 --> 00:48:39.543
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hey.

1151
00:48:39.573 --> 00:48:41.748
- You feeling okay?
- Yeah, yeah, it's good.

1152
00:48:41.778 --> 00:48:42.779
I just had a crazy night.

1153
00:48:42.809 --> 00:48:44.683
Yeah, I know,
it happens to the best of us.

1154
00:48:44.713 --> 00:48:45.858
Listen, Chuck.

1155
00:48:45.888 --> 00:48:48.061
What we're gonna do is we're
just gonna have you read it

1156
00:48:48.091 --> 00:48:49.191
from the script a little bit

1157
00:48:49.221 --> 00:48:50.834
before we offer you the role,
okay?

1158
00:48:50.864 --> 00:48:52.398
- All right, sounds good.
- All right, good.

1159
00:48:52.428 --> 00:48:56.110
So listen, why don't you, um,
turn to page five,

1160
00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:58.245
and, um, when you're ready.

1161
00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.221
Uh...

1162
00:49:01.251 --> 00:49:03.588
- really excited about this.
- Take a deep breath.

1163
00:49:03.618 --> 00:49:05.659
You can do this.
Come on. Here we go.

1164
00:49:05.689 --> 00:49:06.663
Uh...

1165
00:49:08.901 --> 00:49:10.775
Uh, Chink Weber says, um,

1166
00:49:10.805 --> 00:49:12.110
"You are fighting all over..."

1167
00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:13.273
Wait, wait, wait, Chuck, Chuck,

1168
00:49:13.303 --> 00:49:16.648
you, uh, you don't have
to read the character's name.

1169
00:49:16.678 --> 00:49:18.223
You just...

1170
00:49:18.253 --> 00:49:19.560
Just read the lines.

1171
00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:20.628
- Oh, sorry.
- It's all right.

1172
00:49:20.658 --> 00:49:22.259
- That was my first time.
- First time, I understand.

1173
00:49:22.289 --> 00:49:23.764
It's all right.
Now, from the top.

1174
00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.402
All right, uh...

1175
00:49:28.708 --> 00:49:31.617
"You are fighting
all over the place, Rock."

1176
00:49:31.647 --> 00:49:32.687
"Yeah, I know, Chink."

1177
00:49:32.717 --> 00:49:34.587
"You know, I don't think
I'm ready for this fight."

1178
00:49:37.593 --> 00:49:40.195
"You gotta have some heat...
hea... heart."

1179
00:49:40.225 --> 00:49:43.207
- Sorry, sorry, man.
- Take your... Chuck.

1180
00:49:43.237 --> 00:49:45.244
You looked
at these lines before, right?

1181
00:49:45.274 --> 00:49:46.347
Yeah, a little bit, yeah.

1182
00:49:46.377 --> 00:49:47.410
Well, you got nothing
to worry about.

1183
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.347
Come on, man, Chuck,
I wrote this part for you.

1184
00:49:49.377 --> 00:49:51.423
You can do this.

1185
00:49:51.453 --> 00:49:52.690
- All right, sorry.
- Yeah.

1186
00:49:55.328 --> 00:49:56.361
"Come on, Rock.

1187
00:49:56.391 --> 00:49:59.373
You gotta have some
fucking heart out there."

1188
00:49:59.403 --> 00:50:01.343
Read the lines on the page,
please.

1189
00:50:01.373 --> 00:50:02.742
Hey, I can read, asshole.

1190
00:50:02.772 --> 00:50:04.748
- This guy.
- Asshole?

1191
00:50:06.284 --> 00:50:08.392
- Do you know who I am?
- Excuse me?

1192
00:50:08.422 --> 00:50:10.325
Do you know
who you're talking to?

1193
00:50:11.461 --> 00:50:12.899
The guy who gets
Stallone's coffee.

1194
00:50:14.434 --> 00:50:18.609
I produce motion pictures
for Sylvester Stallone.

1195
00:50:20.881 --> 00:50:21.987
You come in here

1196
00:50:22.017 --> 00:50:24.954
and you disrespect everything
we do in this business.

1197
00:50:24.984 --> 00:50:27.297
Get your act together,
read the lines,

1198
00:50:27.327 --> 00:50:28.862
and do me a fucking favor,
all right?

1199
00:50:28.892 --> 00:50:30.531
Don't come in here
fucking around

1200
00:50:30.561 --> 00:50:32.374
and read off the goddamn script!

1201
00:50:32.404 --> 00:50:33.471
I'm gonna knock
this guy's fucking teeth out.

1202
00:50:33.501 --> 00:50:34.506
Hey, hey, hey,
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.

1203
00:50:34.536 --> 00:50:36.644
This is that amateur hour
with this guy, Sly.

1204
00:50:36.674 --> 00:50:38.783
Arthur, one minute here.
Hold on, Chuck.

1205
00:50:38.813 --> 00:50:41.525
This isn't no bars
in Bayonne here.

1206
00:50:41.555 --> 00:50:43.024
Come on, man,
I gave you an opportunity

1207
00:50:43.054 --> 00:50:45.602
to come in here. This guy...
This is a Hollywood guy.

1208
00:50:45.632 --> 00:50:47.066
You gotta do this
in a different way.

1209
00:50:47.096 --> 00:50:49.738
It's a different animal.
Robert put him here for me.

1210
00:50:49.768 --> 00:50:52.515
You gotta make amends here.
Apologize to this guy.

1211
00:50:52.545 --> 00:50:53.713
I ain't apologizing
to this asshole.

1212
00:50:53.743 --> 00:50:55.521
Chuck, you gotta do me a favor.

1213
00:50:55.551 --> 00:50:56.685
You gotta apologize to him.

1214
00:50:56.715 --> 00:50:58.388
I gotta work with this guy.

1215
00:50:58.418 --> 00:51:02.335
- Sorry, sorry.
- No, not to me, to him.

1216
00:51:02.365 --> 00:51:03.936
I brought you down here.
Come on.

1217
00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:06.940
Sorry.

1218
00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:08.380
Okay?

1219
00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:09.681
Yeah, Chuck, lis... Listen.

1220
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:12.824
I'll, I'll meet you...
Wait outside.

1221
00:51:12.854 --> 00:51:13.987
All right,
I'll be right outside.

1222
00:51:14.017 --> 00:51:16.063
We'll do it again, all right?

1223
00:51:16.093 --> 00:51:17.161
It's a good read, Chuck.

1224
00:51:17.191 --> 00:51:18.964
- You're a very good actor.
- Yeah.

1225
00:51:18.994 --> 00:51:20.335
- Very good.
- Thank you.

1226
00:51:27.885 --> 00:51:29.789
That was an embarrassment, Sly.

1227
00:51:31.926 --> 00:51:33.795
Arthur, I tried to give him
a shot, okay?

1228
00:51:33.825 --> 00:51:34.999
I tried to help him.

1229
00:51:42.715 --> 00:51:43.820
Hello?

1230
00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:45.724
Hey, Chuck,
how's it going?

1231
00:51:45.754 --> 00:51:47.589
Fine, I guess. Uh, who is this?

1232
00:51:47.619 --> 00:51:49.531
I'm with <i>Rocky II.</i>

1233
00:51:49.561 --> 00:51:52.498
Hey, look, I'm sorry, Chuck,
they're cutting out your part.

1234
00:51:52.528 --> 00:51:54.743
We're taking Chink Weber
out of the script.

1235
00:51:54.773 --> 00:51:56.775
I'm sorry, it's just the
audition didn't go well

1236
00:51:56.805 --> 00:51:59.720
and the part wasn't really
fitting with the script.

1237
00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:03.222
Hey, Arthur from the studio said
he would like to speak to you.

1238
00:52:03.252 --> 00:52:07.168
Chuck, we feel bad for you.
We really do.

1239
00:52:07.198 --> 00:52:09.640
In all walks of life,
you lose, my friend.

1240
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:13.275
You come this close to the prize
and drop the ball every time.

1241
00:52:13.305 --> 00:52:15.786
Winners win and losers lose,
my friend.

1242
00:52:15.816 --> 00:52:17.890
So if you do want a job, though,

1243
00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.122
you can always start
at the bottom, like I did,

1244
00:52:20.152 --> 00:52:22.198
<i>and maybe get Stallone
his coffee.</i>

1245
00:52:22.228 --> 00:52:24.064
Well, Chuck,
the usual as always,

1246
00:52:24.094 --> 00:52:25.468
go fuck yourself.

1247
00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:32.951
Oh, fuck!

1248
00:52:36.324 --> 00:52:38.265
<i>I already knew
this was coming</i>

1249
00:52:38.295 --> 00:52:39.997
<i>but just like a right cross
to the jaw,</i>

1250
00:52:40.027 --> 00:52:43.171
<i>you see it but it still hurts
when it lands.</i>

1251
00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:24.727
Hello?

1252
00:53:24.757 --> 00:53:26.193
It's, uh, it's Chuck.

1253
00:53:27.028 --> 00:53:28.798
Hey, Chuck, how are you?

1254
00:53:29.834 --> 00:53:31.339
It's kind of late, huh?

1255
00:53:31.369 --> 00:53:33.107
Yeah, sorry about that. I, um...

1256
00:53:34.443 --> 00:53:35.977
can't sleep.

1257
00:53:36.007 --> 00:53:36.951
Mm.

1258
00:53:36.981 --> 00:53:38.985
<i>I auditioned for</i>
Rocky II <i>today.</i>

1259
00:53:40.455 --> 00:53:41.360
Oh.

1260
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:44.700
I didn't know
they were making a sequel.

1261
00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:47.067
Yeah, Stallone
wanted me in it but I, uh...

1262
00:53:49.975 --> 00:53:50.977
I blew it.

1263
00:53:52.446 --> 00:53:56.018
Yeah, well, take comfort
in knowing if it wasn't for you,

1264
00:53:56.048 --> 00:53:58.896
there wouldn't be a <i>Rocky.</i>

1265
00:53:58.926 --> 00:54:02.767
Hey, you want to, uh, you know,
go to dinner or something?

1266
00:54:03.736 --> 00:54:06.245
Yes, I would.

1267
00:54:06.275 --> 00:54:07.508
Now, go to bed, Chuck.

1268
00:54:07.538 --> 00:54:09.445
<i>All right,
goodbye, Linda.</i>

1269
00:54:09.475 --> 00:54:10.717
Bye.

1270
00:54:20.537 --> 00:54:24.245
- Whoo! Nice one.
- Yeah, see what I can do here.

1271
00:54:27.184 --> 00:54:29.192
Mm.

1272
00:54:29.222 --> 00:54:30.892
What's going on with <i>Rocky II?</i>

1273
00:54:34.967 --> 00:54:37.102
Stallone hasn't been
returning my calls.

1274
00:54:37.132 --> 00:54:39.245
Oh. I wouldn't worry.

1275
00:54:39.275 --> 00:54:41.177
I mean, those big
Hollywood actors

1276
00:54:41.207 --> 00:54:42.415
can get so busy.

1277
00:54:43.451 --> 00:54:44.953
How do you do that?

1278
00:54:45.388 --> 00:54:47.462
Do what?

1279
00:54:47.492 --> 00:54:49.828
Make me feel better about
everything that's going on.

1280
00:54:49.858 --> 00:54:51.003
I don't know.

1281
00:54:51.033 --> 00:54:52.769
I just call it like I see it.

1282
00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:59.149
Ha.

1283
00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:04.565
Oh! Not that one.

1284
00:55:04.595 --> 00:55:05.833
Here's your check.

1285
00:55:05.863 --> 00:55:06.929
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, nice.

1286
00:55:06.959 --> 00:55:08.065
You're welcome.

1287
00:55:08.095 --> 00:55:09.941
Let's split it.

1288
00:55:09.971 --> 00:55:11.572
No, no, I... I insist.

1289
00:55:11.602 --> 00:55:13.248
- Let me get it.
- No.

1290
00:55:13.278 --> 00:55:14.585
<i>I felt like a prick.</i>

1291
00:55:14.615 --> 00:55:16.416
<i>I fought the greatest boxer
of all time,</i>

1292
00:55:16.446 --> 00:55:18.888
<i>got one of the most
legendary films of all time</i>

1293
00:55:18.918 --> 00:55:23.035
<i>based off me, and I didn't have
a penny to show for it.</i>

1294
00:55:23.065 --> 00:55:24.835
Turns out I don't really have
any money, though.

1295
00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:27.373
I don't like you anymore.

1296
00:55:28.308 --> 00:55:30.249
Well, I still like you.

1297
00:55:30.279 --> 00:55:31.916
Well, I'll just be your friend.

1298
00:55:33.386 --> 00:55:34.888
What are you doing
with your life?

1299
00:55:35.691 --> 00:55:39.335
Bro, your wife left you.

1300
00:55:39.365 --> 00:55:42.074
You screwed up
the biggest fucking audition

1301
00:55:42.104 --> 00:55:44.375
of your life
with Sylvester Stallone.

1302
00:55:45.712 --> 00:55:47.481
What are you doing
with your life now?

1303
00:55:49.451 --> 00:55:51.125
What am I doing with my life?

1304
00:55:51.155 --> 00:55:53.358
Yeah, what are you doing
with your life, huh?

1305
00:55:53.388 --> 00:55:55.534
You're so special?

1306
00:55:55.564 --> 00:55:58.033
You're an ironworker
from New Jersey, Donnie.

1307
00:55:58.063 --> 00:56:00.572
All right, I'm Chuck Wepner.
People know me.

1308
00:56:00.602 --> 00:56:02.683
People respect me.

1309
00:56:02.713 --> 00:56:04.553
Nobody knows
who Donnie Wepner is

1310
00:56:04.583 --> 00:56:05.619
and you know what?

1311
00:56:07.054 --> 00:56:08.223
Nobody cares.

1312
00:56:09.292 --> 00:56:10.394
You know...

1313
00:56:12.231 --> 00:56:15.104
my wife knows me.

1314
00:56:16.742 --> 00:56:19.413
My kids know me.

1315
00:56:21.284 --> 00:56:23.993
And that's all
that matters to me.

1316
00:56:24.023 --> 00:56:27.232
Yeah, that is that all
that matters to you

1317
00:56:27.262 --> 00:56:28.429
but you know what?

1318
00:56:28.459 --> 00:56:30.305
But not to me, Donnie.

1319
00:56:30.335 --> 00:56:31.537
I'm gonna be somebody.

1320
00:56:32.506 --> 00:56:35.584
Hey! Hey! Then be a good father.

1321
00:56:35.614 --> 00:56:37.119
Be a good husband to your wife

1322
00:56:37.149 --> 00:56:38.685
and stop blowing
alimony money on,

1323
00:56:38.715 --> 00:56:41.558
on booze and cocaine and girls.

1324
00:56:45.366 --> 00:56:46.606
What?

1325
00:56:46.636 --> 00:56:49.044
I am a good father, all right?
My kids love me.

1326
00:56:49.074 --> 00:56:51.215
They know that I love them
because I fucking tell them.

1327
00:56:51.245 --> 00:56:52.545
And me and Phyllis
are better off now

1328
00:56:52.575 --> 00:56:54.054
than we've ever been.

1329
00:56:54.084 --> 00:56:55.686
So stop telling me
how to live my life

1330
00:56:55.716 --> 00:56:56.822
and how to run my family.

1331
00:56:56.852 --> 00:56:59.158
In fact, why don't you
just get the hell out of here?

1332
00:56:59.188 --> 00:57:00.333
'Cause you know I'm right?

1333
00:57:00.363 --> 00:57:02.499
No, because you're a jerk
who I can't be around right now,

1334
00:57:02.529 --> 00:57:03.769
so just get the fuck out!

1335
00:57:03.799 --> 00:57:05.444
I'm the jerk?

1336
00:57:05.474 --> 00:57:08.216
You're the one out there
fighting wrestlers

1337
00:57:08.246 --> 00:57:09.252
and I'm the jerk.

1338
00:57:09.282 --> 00:57:11.818
The whole world's laughing
at you like a clown

1339
00:57:11.848 --> 00:57:13.694
and I'm the jerk.

1340
00:57:13.724 --> 00:57:15.626
I think you're just
a Bayonne jackass.

1341
00:57:15.656 --> 00:57:17.064
Fuck you!

1342
00:57:29.456 --> 00:57:31.598
You don't talk to me anymore.

1343
00:57:31.628 --> 00:57:33.262
You don't tell me
how to live my life.

1344
00:57:33.292 --> 00:57:35.636
You don't tell me
how to run my family.

1345
00:57:37.172 --> 00:57:38.707
You don't talk to anyone
about me.

1346
00:57:38.737 --> 00:57:42.182
You pretend I don't exist
because you know what?

1347
00:57:43.686 --> 00:57:46.759
To me, you no longer exist.

1348
00:57:50.432 --> 00:57:51.468
Fine.

1349
00:57:53.773 --> 00:57:55.814
I'm out of here, you fuck.

1350
00:57:55.844 --> 00:57:58.485
Yeah, get the fuck
out of here, Donnie.

1351
00:57:58.515 --> 00:57:59.652
Get the fuck out of here.

1352
00:58:07.233 --> 00:58:10.440
Blow it out. Blow it out. Blow!

1353
00:58:11.743 --> 00:58:13.779
Come on, push it, Chuckie!

1354
00:58:13.809 --> 00:58:14.949
Push it!

1355
00:58:17.454 --> 00:58:19.624
Give it your all.
That's it? That's all you got?

1356
00:58:19.654 --> 00:58:21.195
Push it, Chuckie!

1357
00:58:23.499 --> 00:58:24.636
A little more.

1358
00:58:25.004 --> 00:58:26.305
Time!

1359
00:58:35.323 --> 00:58:36.426
How do you feel?

1360
00:58:43.641 --> 00:58:45.849
- Chuckie?
- What's up, Al?

1361
00:58:45.879 --> 00:58:47.884
You ever think about
hanging up the gloves?

1362
00:58:49.486 --> 00:58:50.622
Retiring?

1363
00:58:52.458 --> 00:58:54.365
No.

1364
00:58:54.395 --> 00:58:55.800
I think you should.

1365
00:58:59.373 --> 00:59:00.777
You really think it's that time?

1366
00:59:01.812 --> 00:59:03.047
You're overdue.

1367
00:59:07.389 --> 00:59:09.731
But you had a hell of a ride.

1368
00:59:09.761 --> 00:59:12.000
A lot better than most guys
with your skill set.

1369
00:59:13.501 --> 00:59:14.972
You should be proud of yourself.

1370
00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:19.481
Better you get out while
you still got all your marbles.

1371
00:59:20.617 --> 00:59:22.020
You're doing the right thing.

1372
00:59:25.727 --> 00:59:26.830
What's it like?

1373
00:59:27.865 --> 00:59:29.034
You know, to...

1374
00:59:29.802 --> 00:59:31.039
to stop fighting?

1375
00:59:33.844 --> 00:59:36.015
I felt relieved. Most guys do.

1376
00:59:40.456 --> 00:59:41.994
No, you're doing
the right thing.

1377
00:59:47.571 --> 00:59:49.540
It was a great ride, huh, Al?

1378
00:59:51.012 --> 00:59:52.451
Yeah, kid.

1379
00:59:52.481 --> 00:59:53.916
<i>I was hanging up the gloves</i>

1380
00:59:53.946 --> 00:59:56.855
<i>but I still needed cash.
And I won't lie to you.</i>

1381
00:59:56.885 --> 00:59:58.524
<i>I missed the action.</i>

1382
00:59:58.554 --> 01:00:01.972
I was presented
with the... an opportunity.

1383
01:00:02.002 --> 01:00:03.809
- What kind of opportunity?
- A fight.

1384
01:00:03.839 --> 01:00:06.074
Well, I mean, uh,
I'm not really fighting, but...

1385
01:00:06.104 --> 01:00:07.750
You ever been to the circus?

1386
01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:09.854
- Yeah, I've been to the circus.
- Like, a big circus?

1387
01:00:09.884 --> 01:00:10.918
Where they got,
like, animals and shit?

1388
01:00:10.948 --> 01:00:12.755
The one, you know,
that come around with the...

1389
01:00:12.785 --> 01:00:15.766
Yeah, well, they got, like,
uh, bears at the circus.

1390
01:00:15.796 --> 01:00:17.530
Big fucking trained bears
that could, like,

1391
01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:20.075
walk on balls and shit
and do tricks

1392
01:00:20.105 --> 01:00:21.211
and fucking, yeah.

1393
01:00:21.241 --> 01:00:22.079
And kids love them.

1394
01:00:22.109 --> 01:00:23.343
Anyway, this guy comes
into the club

1395
01:00:23.373 --> 01:00:26.989
and he says he wants to put on,
like, a fucking exhibition.

1396
01:00:27.019 --> 01:00:28.487
He's trying
to set up a fight.

1397
01:00:31.161 --> 01:00:32.701
With a bear?

1398
01:00:32.731 --> 01:00:34.772
Yeah, with a bear.

1399
01:00:34.802 --> 01:00:36.002
You want me to fight a bear?

1400
01:00:36.032 --> 01:00:37.573
Would you fight a bear?

1401
01:00:39.578 --> 01:00:42.115
I mean, like, if want to say no,
I'd completely understand.

1402
01:00:42.145 --> 01:00:45.795
It is kind of a fucking
crazy question, I know, but...

1403
01:00:45.825 --> 01:00:48.801
How much money you,
uh, you get to fight a bear?

1404
01:00:48.831 --> 01:00:49.936
I haven't negotiated with him,

1405
01:00:49.966 --> 01:00:51.300
but you'd get a set fee
for the fight,

1406
01:00:51.330 --> 01:00:54.111
and then I would give you
a piece of the door.

1407
01:00:54.141 --> 01:00:56.212
Man, that's
a pretty good fucking deal, man.

1408
01:00:57.815 --> 01:00:58.817
What do you say?

1409
01:01:00.688 --> 01:01:01.755
I believe in you, Chuck.

1410
01:01:01.785 --> 01:01:04.065
I think you can kick
the bear's ass.

1411
01:01:04.095 --> 01:01:05.835
- You think I can beat a bear?
- Yeah.

1412
01:01:05.865 --> 01:01:08.003
I think you would kick
his ass all over the place.

1413
01:01:09.105 --> 01:01:10.244
Come on!

1414
01:01:10.274 --> 01:01:12.143
Fight the fucking bear, Chuck!

1415
01:01:12.173 --> 01:01:13.918
People paid the money!

1416
01:01:13.948 --> 01:01:15.822
Come on, you fucking bear!

1417
01:01:15.852 --> 01:01:17.654
Hit him in the fucking balls!

1418
01:01:17.684 --> 01:01:20.832
Chuck! Chuck! Chuck!

1419
01:01:20.862 --> 01:01:23.905
Chuck! Chuck! Chuck!

1420
01:01:23.935 --> 01:01:26.974
Chuck! Chuck! Chuck!

1421
01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:30.848
<i>Victor's trainer
finally stopped the fight,</i>

1422
01:01:30.878 --> 01:01:32.356
<i>so I guess I won.</i>

1423
01:01:32.386 --> 01:01:35.228
<i>My last fight was a victory
against Victor the Bear.</i>

1424
01:01:35.258 --> 01:01:37.194
<i>The fight with the bear
was good for laughs,</i>

1425
01:01:37.224 --> 01:01:39.901
<i>but now it was time to party.</i>

1426
01:01:42.106 --> 01:01:43.412
Coke for the weekend.

1427
01:01:43.442 --> 01:01:44.981
I, I'm having a big party.

1428
01:01:45.011 --> 01:01:46.882
I, I need to really excite
my guests.

1429
01:01:48.285 --> 01:01:50.860
Come on, man.

1430
01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:52.797
I'm not really
a drug dealer or anything.

1431
01:01:52.827 --> 01:01:54.000
Really, it's,
it's a lot of money.

1432
01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:55.097
You just get me
as much as you can.

1433
01:01:55.127 --> 01:01:56.205
I trust you.

1434
01:01:56.235 --> 01:01:57.936
You know, Artie tells me
great things about you and I...

1435
01:01:57.966 --> 01:01:59.005
You know, I know you
from the past.

1436
01:01:59.035 --> 01:02:00.046
Get it to me by Friday?

1437
01:02:00.076 --> 01:02:01.276
I'll get you the blow by Friday.

1438
01:02:01.306 --> 01:02:02.117
By Friday?

1439
01:02:02.147 --> 01:02:05.219
I'll get you the coke by Friday.
Jesus.

1440
01:02:07.056 --> 01:02:08.391
<i>So Roger needed some coke</i>

1441
01:02:08.421 --> 01:02:10.066
<i>and I knew where to get it.</i>

1442
01:02:10.096 --> 01:02:12.301
<i>No problem. My connect
could take care of that.</i>

1443
01:02:22.354 --> 01:02:23.856
Step out of the car!

1444
01:02:23.886 --> 01:02:26.027
Get the fuck out of the car!

1445
01:02:26.057 --> 01:02:27.198
Get out.

1446
01:02:30.939 --> 01:02:33.046
What's going on, officer?

1447
01:02:33.076 --> 01:02:34.413
Hands up against the wall.

1448
01:02:36.116 --> 01:02:38.152
What do we got?
What do we got? What do we got?

1449
01:02:38.182 --> 01:02:39.991
- I got a gun.
- We got a gun!

1450
01:02:44.066 --> 01:02:46.168
- Another gun.
- We got another gun.

1451
01:02:46.198 --> 01:02:48.307
- It's registered.
- That's nice.

1452
01:02:51.848 --> 01:02:53.952
- Hard candy. We got candy.
- Let me get it.

1453
01:02:55.456 --> 01:02:57.092
Ah, look at this.
Hot, it looks to me.

1454
01:03:02.203 --> 01:03:03.205
Come on.

1455
01:03:04.908 --> 01:03:06.111
Tilt to the side.

1456
01:03:07.179 --> 01:03:08.215
Get in.

1457
01:03:14.227 --> 01:03:17.404
<i>I made an error
in judgment. Uh, a mistake.</i>

1458
01:03:17.434 --> 01:03:20.505
I let down my friends,
my family, my fans,

1459
01:03:20.535 --> 01:03:23.584
and most importantly,
my community.

1460
01:03:23.614 --> 01:03:25.415
And for that, I truly am sorry.

1461
01:03:25.445 --> 01:03:27.057
This is a drug case

1462
01:03:27.087 --> 01:03:29.924
and violence and drugs
often go together.

1463
01:03:29.954 --> 01:03:33.097
You have indeed committed
a serious offense.

1464
01:03:33.127 --> 01:03:35.373
Drugs kill, Mr. Wepner.

1465
01:03:35.403 --> 01:03:37.540
So violence is always inherent,

1466
01:03:37.570 --> 01:03:40.318
and I believe it's inherent
in you.

1467
01:03:40.348 --> 01:03:42.388
You're hereby remanded
to the custody

1468
01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:43.919
of the State Department
of Corrections

1469
01:03:43.949 --> 01:03:47.026
to serve a prison term
of ten years.

1470
01:03:47.056 --> 01:03:49.536
<i>Six-by-eight
and a top bunk.</i>

1471
01:03:49.566 --> 01:03:51.267
<i>That's all the room I had
to think about</i>

1472
01:03:51.297 --> 01:03:52.609
<i>for the next ten years.</i>

1473
01:03:52.639 --> 01:03:54.540
They got me locked up
here with a celebrity.

1474
01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:56.478
Ah, I'm not that famous.

1475
01:03:56.508 --> 01:03:59.490
Hey, what do you mean?
You fought Ali.

1476
01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:02.158
I bet you got one of those
big old houses and everything.

1477
01:04:03.395 --> 01:04:05.067
No.

1478
01:04:05.097 --> 01:04:06.938
<i>All this for trying
to look like a big shot</i>

1479
01:04:06.968 --> 01:04:08.704
<i>that can score some dope
for a bunch of assholes</i>

1480
01:04:08.734 --> 01:04:10.676
<i>who couldn't care less about me.</i>

1481
01:04:11.678 --> 01:04:13.051
<i>Yeah, prison beat me up</i>

1482
01:04:13.081 --> 01:04:14.983
<i>worse than any fighter
could have.</i>

1483
01:04:15.013 --> 01:04:16.424
<i>I'd failed.</i>

1484
01:04:16.454 --> 01:04:17.723
<i>I'd finally become the man</i>

1485
01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:20.499
<i>I thought I fought so hard
to avoid.</i>

1486
01:04:20.529 --> 01:04:23.034
<i>I was exactly where a thug
from Bayonne should be.</i>

1487
01:04:24.103 --> 01:04:25.443
<i>Locked up.</i>

1488
01:04:25.473 --> 01:04:27.347
You know, Stallone
based <i>Rocky off me.</i>

1489
01:04:27.377 --> 01:04:29.713
Well, at least that's
what he said in the papers.

1490
01:04:29.743 --> 01:04:31.723
You know Stallone?

1491
01:04:31.753 --> 01:04:33.721
I auditioned for <i>Rocky II.</i>

1492
01:04:33.751 --> 01:04:35.090
He's a cool guy.

1493
01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.066
Wow.

1494
01:04:37.096 --> 01:04:39.434
Damn, you gotta be
making bank from these movies.

1495
01:04:41.038 --> 01:04:42.277
It was bad apples.

1496
01:04:42.307 --> 01:04:44.108
You know, sometimes you eat
good apples...

1497
01:04:44.138 --> 01:04:48.155
<i>Just like out of some
bizarre dream, there he was.</i>

1498
01:04:48.185 --> 01:04:49.520
You make a lot of money, huh?

1499
01:04:49.550 --> 01:04:51.524
Well, you know,
a little bit here and there.

1500
01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:53.032
How much? How much, man?

1501
01:04:53.062 --> 01:04:54.396
- Come on, man, I don't know.
- Come on.

1502
01:04:54.426 --> 01:04:57.302
It cost me a lot of money.

1503
01:04:57.332 --> 01:04:59.240
No fucking way.

1504
01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:01.282
Hey, Chuck.

1505
01:05:01.312 --> 01:05:02.586
What are you doing here?

1506
01:05:02.616 --> 01:05:03.850
I'm doing time.
What are you doing here?

1507
01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:05.090
Doing time?

1508
01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.292
Oh, go hard.

1509
01:05:06.322 --> 01:05:08.391
I'm doing a prison movie, Chuck.
It's called <i>Lock Up.</i>

1510
01:05:08.421 --> 01:05:10.128
Hey, you guys, come here,
come here.

1511
01:05:10.158 --> 01:05:11.671
You see this guy here?

1512
01:05:11.701 --> 01:05:13.770
This guy
was the inspiration for <i>Rocky.</i>

1513
01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:15.143
Yeah, him.

1514
01:05:15.173 --> 01:05:16.247
Yeah, this guy right here.

1515
01:05:16.277 --> 01:05:17.449
Hey, guys,
you gotta do me a favor.

1516
01:05:17.479 --> 01:05:18.747
You gotta take care
of this guy, okay?

1517
01:05:18.777 --> 01:05:20.483
- We'll take care of him.
- All right, thanks, Sly.

1518
01:05:20.513 --> 01:05:22.186
Hey, listen, Chuck,
it was good seeing you.

1519
01:05:22.216 --> 01:05:24.424
I got to get back to work.
It was good seeing you all.

1520
01:05:24.454 --> 01:05:25.465
I'll probably...

1521
01:05:25.495 --> 01:05:26.629
Maybe I'll see you all,
I'm sure.

1522
01:05:26.659 --> 01:05:27.704
You guys, make sure.

1523
01:05:27.734 --> 01:05:30.241
I'm telling you, this is...
This guy's the real guy.

1524
01:05:30.271 --> 01:05:31.640
- All right, Sly.
- Good seeing you.

1525
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:32.614
All right, Chuck.

1526
01:05:32.644 --> 01:05:34.618
- All right, I'll see you, okay?
- All right, Sly.

1527
01:05:34.648 --> 01:05:35.815
Take care, guys. See you around.

1528
01:05:35.845 --> 01:05:37.852
<i>Seeing him in there was hard.</i>

1529
01:05:37.882 --> 01:05:39.327
<i>He was doing so well.</i>

1530
01:05:39.357 --> 01:05:40.529
The real Rocky here.

1531
01:05:40.559 --> 01:05:42.463
<i>And me,
I was trolling the bottom.</i>

1532
01:05:47.239 --> 01:05:48.942
I feel like such
a piece of shit.

1533
01:05:48.972 --> 01:05:50.145
I mean...

1534
01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:53.587
I know I fucked this all up.

1535
01:05:55.658 --> 01:05:59.531
I'm willing
to, uh, wait for you.

1536
01:06:01.469 --> 01:06:04.208
If you think
you can change, then...

1537
01:06:06.412 --> 01:06:08.516
you can come live with me
when you get out.

1538
01:06:09.351 --> 01:06:10.553
That would be...

1539
01:06:11.723 --> 01:06:12.830
the best thing, ever.

1540
01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:15.263
I mean, I got nothing anymore
but you and I know it.

1541
01:06:15.866 --> 01:06:17.636
I care about you.

1542
01:06:20.876 --> 01:06:22.813
It's good to know someone does.

1543
01:06:24.416 --> 01:06:25.619
Don't give up.

1544
01:06:27.656 --> 01:06:28.792
Don't.

1545
01:06:30.494 --> 01:06:32.235
<i>The only thing
that got me through prison</i>

1546
01:06:32.265 --> 01:06:33.867
<i>was knowing that Linda
would be waiting for me</i>

1547
01:06:33.897 --> 01:06:35.204
<i>on the other side.</i>

1548
01:06:36.573 --> 01:06:37.847
<i>Welcome home, Chuck.</i>

1549
01:06:37.877 --> 01:06:39.785
<i>I mean, when that fence
opened up,</i>

1550
01:06:39.815 --> 01:06:41.989
<i>I knew the true meaning
of a second chance.</i>

1551
01:06:42.019 --> 01:06:44.825
<i>I've never been so happy
and so scared at the same time.</i>

1552
01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.764
<i>Happy to be with her and, uh...</i>

1553
01:06:48.531 --> 01:06:49.838
Time to celebrate.

1554
01:06:49.868 --> 01:06:51.772
<i>...scared shitless
I'd fuck it up somehow.</i>

1555
01:06:53.508 --> 01:06:54.548
What's wrong?

1556
01:06:54.578 --> 01:06:57.818
It's... I, um, you know,
I don't deserve all this.

1557
01:06:59.087 --> 01:07:00.522
Yes, you do.

1558
01:07:03.528 --> 01:07:05.368
I love you, Linda.

1559
01:07:05.398 --> 01:07:07.437
Oh, I love you, too, Chuck.

1560
01:07:11.713 --> 01:07:13.920
<i>Life was the best
when it was simple.</i>

1561
01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:16.593
<i>We didn't have much
and I wasn't a movie star</i>

1562
01:07:16.623 --> 01:07:17.856
<i>or a heavyweight champ,</i>

1563
01:07:17.886 --> 01:07:19.995
<i>but I didn't need to be
any of that.</i>

1564
01:07:20.025 --> 01:07:23.569
<i>I had someone who cared about me
and a place to go home to.</i>

1565
01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:26.341
I, uh...

1566
01:07:27.946 --> 01:07:29.079
Will you marry me, Linda?

1567
01:07:31.519 --> 01:07:32.823
- Yeah?
- Yes.

1568
01:07:33.858 --> 01:07:35.125
- Yes?
- Yes!

1569
01:07:35.155 --> 01:07:36.695
Oh, my god!

1570
01:07:38.668 --> 01:07:40.370
You want to marry me?

1571
01:08:38.791 --> 01:08:39.859
Hi.

1572
01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:55.561
<i>I was back
to selling liquor again.</i>

1573
01:08:55.591 --> 01:08:58.195
<i>It wasn't the best job,
but I was making it work.</i>

1574
01:08:58.225 --> 01:09:01.036
<i>More importantly,
I was keeping my nose clean.</i>

1575
01:09:21.144 --> 01:09:22.847
- Hey, uh, Dave.
- Hey.

1576
01:09:23.983 --> 01:09:25.255
What the fuck is this?

1577
01:09:25.285 --> 01:09:26.185
It's your paycheck.

1578
01:09:26.215 --> 01:09:28.729
I think it's missing
a zero at the end.

1579
01:09:28.759 --> 01:09:30.795
Look, things ain't what they
used to be, you know, right?

1580
01:09:30.825 --> 01:09:32.002
Nobody's paying top dollar

1581
01:09:32.032 --> 01:09:33.700
for the bring
your own booze anymore.

1582
01:09:33.730 --> 01:09:36.239
Yeah, it's not my booze,
but, you know, it'd be nice

1583
01:09:36.269 --> 01:09:38.984
if I can get a bit bigger
of a check, you know.

1584
01:09:39.014 --> 01:09:40.821
I'm surprised here
because, you know,

1585
01:09:40.851 --> 01:09:42.318
I sold more liquor
for this company

1586
01:09:42.348 --> 01:09:43.755
than any of the salesmen.

1587
01:09:43.785 --> 01:09:46.766
Twenty years ago.
It's the 21st century.

1588
01:09:46.796 --> 01:09:48.932
The only guys that are famous
from boxing anymore

1589
01:09:48.962 --> 01:09:52.110
are Ali, Tyson,
George Foreman, Rocky.

1590
01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:53.647
You're a good salesman, Chuck.

1591
01:09:53.677 --> 01:09:55.247
Just not as famous
as you once were.

1592
01:10:28.748 --> 01:10:30.488
Uh, I went to look for you
on the floor,

1593
01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:31.955
but they said
you was up here now.

1594
01:10:38.301 --> 01:10:40.472
It's been so many years, Chuck.

1595
01:10:51.161 --> 01:10:52.363
I'm an idiot.

1596
01:10:56.939 --> 01:10:58.108
I love you, bro.

1597
01:11:10.267 --> 01:11:14.843
So, uh, tell me
about prison, bro.

1598
01:11:21.022 --> 01:11:22.427
You got a sec?

1599
01:11:22.457 --> 01:11:23.698
What's going on?

1600
01:11:23.728 --> 01:11:27.338
I got a shop called Ginsberg's
and we do sports memorabilia.

1601
01:11:27.368 --> 01:11:29.437
We do all that kind of stuff,
you know?

1602
01:11:29.467 --> 01:11:31.947
"Ginsberg Sports Memorabilia."

1603
01:11:31.977 --> 01:11:33.851
We deal a lot
of high-end clientele,

1604
01:11:33.881 --> 01:11:35.883
and, uh, you know, we want
to talk business with you.

1605
01:11:35.913 --> 01:11:36.924
You should come down.

1606
01:11:36.954 --> 01:11:38.656
So you do, like,
you know, signings?

1607
01:11:38.686 --> 01:11:39.925
All that kind of stuff?

1608
01:11:39.955 --> 01:11:40.899
We do everything.

1609
01:11:40.929 --> 01:11:42.229
We do everything sports
memorabilia and stuff.

1610
01:11:42.259 --> 01:11:43.270
Good money.

1611
01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:44.367
You come in.
You sign some stuff.

1612
01:11:44.397 --> 01:11:45.336
It's way better than this.

1613
01:11:45.366 --> 01:11:47.642
We deal with, like,
Muhammad Ali, you know?

1614
01:11:47.672 --> 01:11:50.280
- Oh, you got Muhammad?
- Yeah, Muhammad.

1615
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:51.954
Uh, Jackie Robinson.

1616
01:11:51.984 --> 01:11:54.661
Uh, Jake LaMotta.
Like, everybody.

1617
01:11:54.691 --> 01:11:56.993
All right.
Well, it was nice meeting you.

1618
01:11:57.023 --> 01:11:58.664
Can you... Can you sign this?

1619
01:11:58.694 --> 01:12:00.402
I know, I'm sorry.

1620
01:12:01.638 --> 01:12:03.976
All right, here you go.

1621
01:12:06.047 --> 01:12:07.514
You're the best, champ.
Thank you so much.

1622
01:12:07.544 --> 01:12:09.323
<i>I had my doubts about Olson.</i>

1623
01:12:09.353 --> 01:12:11.255
<i>He was up to no good
and I fucking knew it,</i>

1624
01:12:11.285 --> 01:12:13.231
<i>but the money came so easy.</i>

1625
01:12:13.261 --> 01:12:14.996
<i>See, it's hard to make
the right decision</i>

1626
01:12:15.026 --> 01:12:17.273
<i>when you know the money's
right there in your face.</i>

1627
01:12:17.303 --> 01:12:18.570
- Here you go. Here's a photo.
- I'm so excited to meet you.

1628
01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.207
- What's your name?
- Theresa.

1629
01:12:20.237 --> 01:12:21.311
Theresa, all right.

1630
01:12:23.449 --> 01:12:25.084
- There you are.
- Get the next one.

1631
01:12:25.114 --> 01:12:26.125
I'll never share.

1632
01:12:26.155 --> 01:12:27.522
Oh, my god,
I'll follow you forever.

1633
01:12:27.552 --> 01:12:29.264
Thank you. Absolutely.

1634
01:12:29.294 --> 01:12:30.635
<i>The more money
I got off Olson,</i>

1635
01:12:30.665 --> 01:12:32.165
<i>the more I kept getting
the feeling</i>

1636
01:12:32.195 --> 01:12:33.568
<i>that he was up to no good.</i>

1637
01:12:33.598 --> 01:12:35.076
<i>I couldn't stop, though.</i>

1638
01:12:35.106 --> 01:12:37.342
<i>I mean, 300 bucks
for signing some gloves</i>

1639
01:12:37.372 --> 01:12:39.084
<i>and another $200 for a picture?</i>

1640
01:12:39.114 --> 01:12:40.482
<i>I knew it was too good
to be true</i>

1641
01:12:40.512 --> 01:12:42.993
<i>but it beat busting
my ass selling booze.</i>

1642
01:12:43.023 --> 01:12:44.596
Chuck.
Hey, man, how you doing?

1643
01:12:44.626 --> 01:12:46.093
- Come on in, Come on in.
- Hey, John.

1644
01:12:46.123 --> 01:12:48.103
- How you doing?
- Look at this place.

1645
01:12:48.133 --> 01:12:49.802
Yeah.
Did you see upstairs? Ginsburg?

1646
01:12:49.832 --> 01:12:51.543
- It's awesome.
- Right.

1647
01:12:51.573 --> 01:12:53.610
You gotta get a boxing ring
in the middle.

1648
01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:55.548
Yeah, yeah, we should.
You're right.

1649
01:12:57.151 --> 01:12:58.753
Come on in. Come on in.
Let's hit some balls.

1650
01:12:58.783 --> 01:12:59.594
Let's, let's talk.

1651
01:12:59.624 --> 01:13:01.157
Oh, you're gonna
make me play baseball?

1652
01:13:01.187 --> 01:13:03.468
- Yeah, why not?
- All right.

1653
01:13:03.498 --> 01:13:05.500
- Right? A guy like you?
- Look at this.

1654
01:13:05.530 --> 01:13:08.277
Really smack
the crap out of the ball.

1655
01:13:08.307 --> 01:13:10.309
It's been awhile
since I've been in a cage.

1656
01:13:10.339 --> 01:13:11.685
Yeah, I'm glad you came back.

1657
01:13:11.715 --> 01:13:13.120
I'm sorry I couldn't see you
the other day.

1658
01:13:13.150 --> 01:13:14.686
I had a thing.
I was dealing with Muhammad Ali.

1659
01:13:14.716 --> 01:13:16.160
Yeah, I came by
and you weren't here.

1660
01:13:16.190 --> 01:13:17.392
Yeah, I was in Vegas, you know.

1661
01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:19.830
Let me ask you something.

1662
01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:21.438
You, uh, you know, with these...

1663
01:13:21.468 --> 01:13:22.836
with these signatures
and all that,

1664
01:13:22.866 --> 01:13:25.647
what kind of money,
you know, is in that?

1665
01:13:25.677 --> 01:13:27.316
We can make
a lot of money, Chuck.

1666
01:13:27.346 --> 01:13:29.320
And I'm not talking
about 20 bucks an autograph.

1667
01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:30.718
All right, I saw what
you were doing the other day.

1668
01:13:30.748 --> 01:13:32.555
- Yeah.
- And that's great, okay?

1669
01:13:32.585 --> 01:13:35.227
It's a good little scratch,
a little side thing.

1670
01:13:35.257 --> 01:13:37.739
But we think you should be
at the next level.

1671
01:13:37.769 --> 01:13:39.201
I can make you a lot more money.

1672
01:13:39.231 --> 01:13:40.645
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1673
01:13:40.675 --> 01:13:42.509
- Listen, do me a favor.
- Yeah.

1674
01:13:42.539 --> 01:13:43.551
Hit that ball.

1675
01:13:43.581 --> 01:13:45.180
- Hit this ball?
- Hit that ball.

1676
01:13:47.186 --> 01:13:48.421
You know what you just hit?

1677
01:13:48.451 --> 01:13:49.528
No, what'd I just hit?

1678
01:13:49.558 --> 01:13:51.861
You just hit a $10,000 baseball.
Is what you just hit.

1679
01:13:51.891 --> 01:13:54.734
There's no such thing
as a $10,000 baseball.

1680
01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:55.841
It's a Babe Ruth.

1681
01:13:55.871 --> 01:13:57.707
<i>Olson was a real fucking weasel.</i>

1682
01:13:57.737 --> 01:13:59.845
<i>Slick as they come,
that guy was.</i>

1683
01:13:59.875 --> 01:14:02.720
<i>I didn't like him,
but I liked the money.</i>

1684
01:14:19.654 --> 01:14:21.390
Holy shit.

1685
01:14:24.295 --> 01:14:26.566
Oh, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.

1686
01:14:27.904 --> 01:14:29.778
You done good.

1687
01:14:29.808 --> 01:14:32.984
Unbelievable. That's Babe Ruth.

1688
01:14:33.014 --> 01:14:34.818
That's fucking Babe Ruth!

1689
01:14:36.989 --> 01:14:38.796
I'll just throw it in there.

1690
01:14:38.826 --> 01:14:41.328
Who could I do today?
Who am I gonna be today?

1691
01:14:41.358 --> 01:14:42.732
<i>You gotta love Babe Ruth.</i>

1692
01:14:42.762 --> 01:14:45.270
My grandfather saw him
in Philadelphia.

1693
01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:46.578
He's so lucky.

1694
01:14:46.608 --> 01:14:48.978
I wish I was alive and I wish
I was back then.

1695
01:14:49.008 --> 01:14:50.988
What are all these?

1696
01:14:51.018 --> 01:14:54.428
Ah, you know, I've been doing
some signings recently.

1697
01:14:54.458 --> 01:14:55.926
Trying to make some extra cash.

1698
01:14:55.956 --> 01:14:58.302
Getting fan mail.
Look. All these.

1699
01:14:58.332 --> 01:14:59.767
<i>Since we got
some extra coming in,</i>

1700
01:14:59.797 --> 01:15:03.775
<i>I thought maybe
we could go away with a trip.</i>

1701
01:15:03.805 --> 01:15:06.647
<i>I love that idea.
Paris. Warren.</i>

1702
01:15:20.645 --> 01:15:24.517
<i>This is going to be
the biggest raid in FBI history.</i>

1703
01:15:24.547 --> 01:15:26.794
It's called Operation Bullpen.

1704
01:15:26.824 --> 01:15:28.458
It centers around
certain criminals

1705
01:15:28.488 --> 01:15:31.499
who think it's okay
to forge memorabilia autographs.

1706
01:15:33.739 --> 01:15:34.906
- Incredible player.
- Oh, my god.

1707
01:15:34.936 --> 01:15:37.048
- Did you just hear that?
- Yeah, I did.

1708
01:15:37.078 --> 01:15:38.849
- Oh, my god.
- This guy Olson's unbelievable.

1709
01:15:40.018 --> 01:15:41.558
Oh, my gosh.

1710
01:15:41.588 --> 01:15:43.057
Let's get these fuckers.

1711
01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:58.058
Special Agent-in-Charge
John Corbin.

1712
01:15:58.088 --> 01:16:00.630
We have an arrest warrant
for John Olson.

1713
01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:02.096
- Where is he?
- He's downstairs.

1714
01:16:06.004 --> 01:16:07.510
Oh, shit.

1715
01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:08.776
Fuck you!

1716
01:16:10.814 --> 01:16:12.754
<i>Olson was a real con man.</i>

1717
01:16:12.784 --> 01:16:14.552
<i>He was part of
a multimillion-dollar</i>

1718
01:16:14.582 --> 01:16:16.028
<i>memorabilia forgery ring</i>

1719
01:16:16.058 --> 01:16:17.894
<i>that was a coast-to-coast
business.</i>

1720
01:16:17.924 --> 01:16:18.934
Turn around!

1721
01:16:18.964 --> 01:16:21.874
- There's no crying in baseball.
- Fuck you.

1722
01:16:21.904 --> 01:16:23.639
- Fuck you.
- Come on, man, those are real.

1723
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:25.748
<i>It was called Operation Bullpen</i>

1724
01:16:25.778 --> 01:16:28.147
<i>because most of the swag
was baseball stuff.</i>

1725
01:16:28.177 --> 01:16:30.090
<i>You see,
the inventory comes in</i>

1726
01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:33.029
and I just take it and I just,
you know, I clean it up.

1727
01:16:33.059 --> 01:16:34.127
You know what I mean?
I just clean...

1728
01:16:34.157 --> 01:16:35.495
I just clean it up.
I take the ball.

1729
01:16:35.525 --> 01:16:37.906
I take the autograph. I take...

1730
01:16:37.936 --> 01:16:39.475
<i>Now, looking back on it...</i>

1731
01:16:39.505 --> 01:16:41.546
...make sure if it's, like,
you know, age and stuff.

1732
01:16:41.576 --> 01:16:43.111
And I just...
I do, like, detail work...

1733
01:16:43.141 --> 01:16:44.882
<i>...I'd probably be
better off selling booze.</i>

1734
01:16:44.912 --> 01:16:46.658
...my forte is detail lifts.

1735
01:16:46.688 --> 01:16:50.061
<i>My part was small potatoes,
but try telling that to Linda.</i>

1736
01:16:58.678 --> 01:16:59.847
Go.

1737
01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:03.224
Chuck Wepner.

1738
01:17:03.254 --> 01:17:05.323
Chuck Wepner, I have
a warrant for your arrest.

1739
01:17:05.353 --> 01:17:06.899
You have the right
to remain silent.

1740
01:17:06.929 --> 01:17:08.129
You have the right
to an attorney.

1741
01:17:08.159 --> 01:17:10.636
If you cannot afford one,
one will be provided for you.

1742
01:17:11.939 --> 01:17:14.208
Bring enough guys
to arrest an old man?

1743
01:17:14.238 --> 01:17:15.182
What's going on?

1744
01:17:15.212 --> 01:17:17.821
Ma'am, your husband's
being taken into custody

1745
01:17:17.851 --> 01:17:20.092
for his involvement
in a sports memorabilia fraud.

1746
01:17:20.122 --> 01:17:22.291
There must be a mistake.
Tell him it's a mistake, Chuck.

1747
01:17:22.321 --> 01:17:23.666
Ma'am, if you didn't
see anything,

1748
01:17:23.696 --> 01:17:25.264
you will be obstructing
this case. Let's go.

1749
01:17:25.294 --> 01:17:26.739
Don't worry, honey.

1750
01:17:26.769 --> 01:17:29.039
Call my lawyer.
He'll take care of this.

1751
01:17:29.069 --> 01:17:30.978
You tell them it's a mistake!

1752
01:17:34.117 --> 01:17:36.053
We got everything
on tape already, Chuck.

1753
01:17:36.083 --> 01:17:37.628
What do you got on tape?

1754
01:17:37.658 --> 01:17:39.999
Everything. The deals.
The autographs.

1755
01:17:40.029 --> 01:17:41.836
The conspiracy
with you and Olson.

1756
01:17:41.866 --> 01:17:43.236
What do you do with John Olson?

1757
01:17:44.004 --> 01:17:45.244
I sign autographs.

1758
01:17:45.274 --> 01:17:46.780
Who wants your autograph?

1759
01:17:46.810 --> 01:17:48.878
You're a has-been.
You're washed up.

1760
01:17:48.908 --> 01:17:51.384
You fought a bear,
like, 40 years ago.

1761
01:17:51.414 --> 01:17:54.062
What have you done since?
Tell me.

1762
01:17:54.092 --> 01:17:56.099
In all of these, uh, wiretaps,

1763
01:17:56.129 --> 01:17:57.429
all this stuff you've been
talking about,

1764
01:17:57.459 --> 01:17:58.838
photographs, all that,

1765
01:17:58.868 --> 01:18:00.436
did you ever see me sign
any name

1766
01:18:00.466 --> 01:18:02.340
other than Chuck Wepner
or anything?

1767
01:18:02.370 --> 01:18:03.377
No.

1768
01:18:04.045 --> 01:18:05.351
So can I leave?

1769
01:18:05.381 --> 01:18:06.715
<i>You had the world
in your hands</i>

1770
01:18:06.745 --> 01:18:07.984
<i>and you go and fuck it up!</i>

1771
01:18:08.014 --> 01:18:10.058
Why is that, Chuck? Why?

1772
01:18:12.897 --> 01:18:15.105
- Sorry, I... I didn't know.
- Bullshit!

1773
01:18:15.135 --> 01:18:17.740
You're not sorry and you knew
damn well what you were doing.

1774
01:18:19.143 --> 01:18:22.052
This is typical Chuck Wepner.

1775
01:18:22.082 --> 01:18:24.151
A guy who thinks
he can do anything he wants

1776
01:18:24.181 --> 01:18:26.789
because the world
keeps shitting on him.

1777
01:18:26.819 --> 01:18:29.264
You know, Chuck,
we all get shit on!

1778
01:18:30.799 --> 01:18:32.707
I don't need
a lecture right now.

1779
01:18:32.737 --> 01:18:34.177
Yes, you do need a lecture!

1780
01:18:34.207 --> 01:18:37.280
You need a lecture more than
you need anything in your life!

1781
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:41.121
I just hope
it's not too late for you.

1782
01:18:45.262 --> 01:18:47.504
Hey, hey, it's not.

1783
01:18:47.534 --> 01:18:50.305
Don't you give up on me, Linda.
Don't you do it.

1784
01:18:50.335 --> 01:18:52.414
Don't give up on you?

1785
01:18:52.444 --> 01:18:56.122
So I can come visit you
in prison the rest of your life?

1786
01:18:56.152 --> 01:18:59.428
All I did was sign my name.
I didn't do anything wrong.

1787
01:18:59.458 --> 01:19:00.928
How do I know
you're not lying to me?

1788
01:19:02.331 --> 01:19:03.804
Why would we be here

1789
01:19:03.834 --> 01:19:05.337
if you were just signing
your name?

1790
01:19:11.082 --> 01:19:12.352
You look beautiful, by the way.

1791
01:19:13.019 --> 01:19:14.526
Fuck you!

1792
01:19:14.556 --> 01:19:16.158
You're a fucking idiot!

1793
01:19:17.128 --> 01:19:18.528
Putting me in this position.

1794
01:19:18.558 --> 01:19:19.530
I fucking do nothing

1795
01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.936
but good things for you,
and you're fucking me.

1796
01:19:21.966 --> 01:19:23.544
You're fucking me.

1797
01:19:23.574 --> 01:19:25.514
I'm gonna fucking
grow old by myself.

1798
01:19:25.544 --> 01:19:27.881
I can't take care of myself.
I have no money coming in.

1799
01:19:27.911 --> 01:19:30.157
It's all from you,
so I'm fucked.

1800
01:19:30.187 --> 01:19:31.557
I'm fucked. Thanks, Chuck.

1801
01:19:34.095 --> 01:19:35.631
Okay, they're ready for you.

1802
01:19:35.661 --> 01:19:37.501
Now, Chuck,
we're all disappointed.

1803
01:19:37.531 --> 01:19:39.410
We're all fans.

1804
01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:40.479
You know, I...

1805
01:19:40.509 --> 01:19:42.444
Dealing with a degenerate
like this guy, Olson,

1806
01:19:42.474 --> 01:19:44.353
what the hell
was that all about?

1807
01:19:44.383 --> 01:19:45.250
I mean, come on, man.

1808
01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:46.889
You're getting too old
for this shit.

1809
01:19:47.957 --> 01:19:50.432
All right? Turn it over.

1810
01:19:50.462 --> 01:19:52.564
Your client
pleads guilty to one count.

1811
01:19:52.594 --> 01:19:54.073
He does one day...

1812
01:19:54.103 --> 01:19:55.309
<i>And just like that,</i>

1813
01:19:55.339 --> 01:19:56.940
<i>I walk out with a slap
on the wrist.</i>

1814
01:19:56.970 --> 01:19:59.384
<i>My so-called participation
in this was a joke</i>

1815
01:19:59.414 --> 01:20:01.251
<i>and I was glad to have it
behind me.</i>

1816
01:20:03.356 --> 01:20:05.363
<i>Just when I was clear
of the Feds,</i>

1817
01:20:05.393 --> 01:20:08.603
<i>the universe decide to take
a dump on me one more time.</i>

1818
01:20:08.633 --> 01:20:10.969
Last time I saw you,
you was behind bars.

1819
01:20:10.999 --> 01:20:12.010
Well, I'm out now.

1820
01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.374
Broke as shit,
but I'm a free man.

1821
01:20:13.404 --> 01:20:15.183
Oh, kid, that's a shame.

1822
01:20:15.213 --> 01:20:17.315
<i>Turns out Stallone was
filming something in Bayonne.</i>

1823
01:20:17.345 --> 01:20:18.558
<i>Right in my backyard.</i>

1824
01:20:18.588 --> 01:20:20.628
Oh, we're doing this movie
<i>Cop Land.</i>

1825
01:20:20.658 --> 01:20:22.291
- Any good?
- Oh, yeah, it's great.

1826
01:20:22.321 --> 01:20:24.000
Big kid, De Niro is in it.

1827
01:20:24.030 --> 01:20:26.206
No way, Bobby D?
The <i>Raging Bull himself?</i>

1828
01:20:26.236 --> 01:20:28.138
- Why, you want to meet him?
- Yeah.

1829
01:20:28.168 --> 01:20:29.379
I'll get him.

1830
01:20:29.409 --> 01:20:31.979
Mr. Stallone, you're on standby.
They're ready for you on set.

1831
01:20:32.009 --> 01:20:33.019
Yeah, sure.

1832
01:20:33.049 --> 01:20:35.085
Hey, hey,
do you know who this is?

1833
01:20:35.115 --> 01:20:36.126
No, sir, I don't.

1834
01:20:36.156 --> 01:20:37.328
This is Chuck Wepner.

1835
01:20:37.358 --> 01:20:38.626
Hi, Mr. Wepner,
nice to meet you.

1836
01:20:38.656 --> 01:20:39.997
- I'm Maura.
- Hello, hi.

1837
01:20:40.464 --> 01:20:42.439
He was a boxer.

1838
01:20:42.469 --> 01:20:44.705
Oh, is this the fighter
you saw fight Ali?

1839
01:20:44.735 --> 01:20:45.841
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Wow.

1840
01:20:45.871 --> 01:20:50.115
This must be something,
standing next to Rocky, right?

1841
01:20:50.145 --> 01:20:51.187
Right?

1842
01:20:51.721 --> 01:20:52.760
Yeah, cute, huh?

1843
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:55.298
You always hire such smart
alecks on these shoots?

1844
01:20:55.328 --> 01:20:57.102
Oh, Chuck, she didn't mean
anything by it.

1845
01:20:57.132 --> 01:20:58.265
You know what I mean?
She's young.

1846
01:20:58.295 --> 01:20:59.440
She don't even know who I am.

1847
01:20:59.470 --> 01:21:01.205
Maura, do me a favor, now.
I'll be with you in a minute.

1848
01:21:01.235 --> 01:21:02.509
- All right, just tell them.
- Okay.

1849
01:21:03.411 --> 01:21:04.582
You see Stallone?

1850
01:21:05.617 --> 01:21:07.558
Yeah, I saw him.

1851
01:21:07.588 --> 01:21:09.120
I felt like a real outsider
on that set.

1852
01:21:09.150 --> 01:21:11.197
Like a...
like a fan or something.

1853
01:21:11.227 --> 01:21:12.160
What are you talking about?

1854
01:21:12.190 --> 01:21:14.270
I mean, everyone calls me
the Real Rocky

1855
01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:15.469
but what do I get for it?
Nothing.

1856
01:21:18.610 --> 01:21:21.147
You should get compensated
for what they took from you.

1857
01:21:22.383 --> 01:21:23.222
You know?

1858
01:21:23.252 --> 01:21:25.795
What Stallone
did to you wasn't right.

1859
01:21:25.825 --> 01:21:28.098
You've been a fighter
your whole life.

1860
01:21:28.128 --> 01:21:29.397
You're gonna throw in
the towel now?

1861
01:21:31.134 --> 01:21:32.404
What do you want me to do,
Linda?

1862
01:21:33.339 --> 01:21:34.609
I want you to fight him.

1863
01:21:36.178 --> 01:21:38.180
You want me
to kick Stallone's ass?

1864
01:21:38.210 --> 01:21:40.223
Yeah, I do.

1865
01:21:40.253 --> 01:21:41.487
You've lost
your marbles, Linda.

1866
01:21:41.517 --> 01:21:42.625
No, I'm serious.

1867
01:21:43.426 --> 01:21:44.562
Go kick his ass.

1868
01:21:46.265 --> 01:21:48.401
You really want me to kick
Sylvester Stallone's ass?

1869
01:21:48.431 --> 01:21:50.774
Yeah, I do,
but not with your fists.

1870
01:21:50.804 --> 01:21:52.444
You do it with lawyers.

1871
01:21:53.346 --> 01:21:55.488
You sue him.

1872
01:21:55.518 --> 01:21:57.593
- For what?
- For ripping off your life.

1873
01:21:57.623 --> 01:21:58.690
He didn't rip off my life.

1874
01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:00.461
He said I... I inspired <i>Rocky.</i>

1875
01:22:01.898 --> 01:22:03.605
Oh, you're a lawyer now?

1876
01:22:03.635 --> 01:22:05.502
You know what that means?
No, you don't.

1877
01:22:05.532 --> 01:22:07.241
So go talk to a lawyer.

1878
01:22:08.678 --> 01:22:10.682
They made billions
off you, Chuck.

1879
01:22:11.819 --> 01:22:13.454
And what did you get for it?

1880
01:22:14.557 --> 01:22:16.193
Nothing but a pat on the back.

1881
01:22:18.766 --> 01:22:20.439
Think about it.

1882
01:22:20.469 --> 01:22:21.639
It's not so crazy.

1883
01:22:26.514 --> 01:22:29.290
I don't know, I mean,
I'm not used to suing people.

1884
01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:31.455
Last time I was in court,
they were putting me in jail.

1885
01:22:31.485 --> 01:22:32.895
You got nothing to lose.

1886
01:22:38.471 --> 01:22:39.574
You should.

1887
01:22:40.543 --> 01:22:41.746
Get what's yours.

1888
01:22:44.819 --> 01:22:46.522
It's the other way around now.

1889
01:22:47.490 --> 01:22:48.593
It's your turn.

1890
01:22:49.996 --> 01:22:51.833
It's time to lace up them
gloves, honey.

1891
01:22:54.005 --> 01:22:56.542
So you want to fight
Sylvester Stallone?

1892
01:22:57.913 --> 01:22:59.552
Can I?

1893
01:22:59.582 --> 01:23:01.489
You do have a case, Mr. Wepner.

1894
01:23:01.519 --> 01:23:03.594
I've been pouring
through the records

1895
01:23:03.624 --> 01:23:05.461
as well as the actual
<i>Rocky films.</i>

1896
01:23:07.699 --> 01:23:09.773
- So we have a case?
- I'd say so.

1897
01:23:09.803 --> 01:23:11.239
I think you got a good one.

1898
01:23:12.642 --> 01:23:13.778
Will you represent me?

1899
01:23:15.481 --> 01:23:17.318
It'd be our privilege to do so.

1900
01:23:18.453 --> 01:23:19.492
But won't he have, like,

1901
01:23:19.522 --> 01:23:21.058
big Hollywood lawyers
who are gonna fight this?

1902
01:23:21.088 --> 01:23:22.630
Yeah, he will.

1903
01:23:24.032 --> 01:23:26.805
All right. Buh-bye.

1904
01:23:29.677 --> 01:23:31.317
Who was that?

1905
01:23:31.347 --> 01:23:32.650
It was the lawyers.

1906
01:23:33.384 --> 01:23:35.024
What'd they say?

1907
01:23:35.054 --> 01:23:36.522
We're suing Stallone.

1908
01:23:36.552 --> 01:23:37.660
We are?

1909
01:23:38.829 --> 01:23:40.736
Hey, Martin, relax. I got this.

1910
01:23:40.766 --> 01:23:42.500
I'm walking to him right now.

1911
01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:43.738
Yeah, I got this.

1912
01:23:43.768 --> 01:23:44.907
Relax.

1913
01:23:44.937 --> 01:23:45.911
No.

1914
01:23:48.650 --> 01:23:49.785
No.

1915
01:23:52.523 --> 01:23:53.525
No.

1916
01:23:54.895 --> 01:23:56.368
Marty's on the phone.

1917
01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:57.632
Tell him I'll call him back
in an hour.

1918
01:23:57.662 --> 01:23:58.701
I'm about to shoot a scene.

1919
01:23:58.731 --> 01:23:59.842
He says it's important.

1920
01:23:59.872 --> 01:24:01.173
I'll call him back in an hour.

1921
01:24:01.203 --> 01:24:02.611
Talk to Marty.

1922
01:24:08.156 --> 01:24:09.563
Yeah, Marty,
what's so important?

1923
01:24:09.593 --> 01:24:10.995
I'm in the middle of shooting
a scene here.

1924
01:24:12.832 --> 01:24:14.706
Deposition?

1925
01:24:14.736 --> 01:24:15.838
What are you talking about?

1926
01:24:16.974 --> 01:24:20.083
No. No, I'm not doing it.

1927
01:24:20.113 --> 01:24:21.783
What do you mean
I have to do it?

1928
01:24:22.819 --> 01:24:24.421
No, that's ridiculous.

1929
01:24:25.959 --> 01:24:28.496
Look, Marty, it's got no merit.
It's ridiculous.

1930
01:24:29.565 --> 01:24:31.006
You know what,

1931
01:24:31.036 --> 01:24:32.671
Marty, you're the best lawyer
in Hollywood.

1932
01:24:32.701 --> 01:24:34.445
Get it thrown out.

1933
01:24:34.475 --> 01:24:36.511
<i>I was finally ready
to fight for what was mine.</i>

1934
01:24:36.541 --> 01:24:38.917
<i>I didn't want to hurt Stallone,
but I couldn't be broke</i>

1935
01:24:38.947 --> 01:24:41.460
<i>while my life was being lived
out by a bunch of guys</i>

1936
01:24:41.490 --> 01:24:42.724
<i>who made a fortune off me.</i>

1937
01:24:42.754 --> 01:24:45.664
You know, I just want to go
on record here to let you know

1938
01:24:45.694 --> 01:24:48.808
that this whole lawsuit
is an insult. Okay?

1939
01:24:48.838 --> 01:24:51.108
I'm here only because my lawyer
wants me here,

1940
01:24:51.138 --> 01:24:52.717
but I shouldn't even be here.

1941
01:24:52.747 --> 01:24:54.048
So go ahead, ask your questions.

1942
01:24:54.078 --> 01:24:55.590
- Okay.
- All right.

1943
01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:57.989
Let's talk about
what role Chuck Wepner

1944
01:24:58.019 --> 01:24:59.793
played in the <i>Rocky movies.</i>

1945
01:24:59.823 --> 01:25:01.936
What role?
He didn't have a role.

1946
01:25:01.966 --> 01:25:03.038
<i>Rocky was my idea.</i>

1947
01:25:03.068 --> 01:25:05.239
I had it long before
I ever heard of Chuck Wepner.

1948
01:25:06.175 --> 01:25:07.575
He had no role whatsoever.

1949
01:25:07.605 --> 01:25:09.946
He was...
He was inspiration. That's it.

1950
01:25:09.976 --> 01:25:13.626
So you admit that my client
was your inspiration

1951
01:25:13.656 --> 01:25:14.689
for writing this film?

1952
01:25:14.719 --> 01:25:17.935
No, it was inspiring
to watch Wepner fight Ali,

1953
01:25:17.965 --> 01:25:19.537
but he didn't inspire <i>Rocky.</i>

1954
01:25:19.567 --> 01:25:21.003
That's two entirely
different things.

1955
01:25:21.033 --> 01:25:24.782
But you did credit Chuck
publicly on numerous occasions

1956
01:25:24.812 --> 01:25:27.621
with being the inspiration
for <i>Rocky, am I correct?</i>

1957
01:25:27.651 --> 01:25:29.826
It was a marketing thing
for credibility.

1958
01:25:29.856 --> 01:25:31.091
It wasn't a creative thing.

1959
01:25:32.328 --> 01:25:33.233
Look, you know what?

1960
01:25:33.263 --> 01:25:34.697
I don't even know
why we're even in here.

1961
01:25:34.727 --> 01:25:35.738
- You know that?
- Just...

1962
01:25:35.768 --> 01:25:36.806
You're a... You know what?

1963
01:25:36.836 --> 01:25:38.138
- Just answer his question!
- You're a real phony.

1964
01:25:38.168 --> 01:25:39.645
You're a dick.

1965
01:25:39.675 --> 01:25:40.879
- Let's take a break.
- All right.

1966
01:25:42.682 --> 01:25:43.983
She's typing out everything.

1967
01:25:44.013 --> 01:25:45.124
Everything you're saying.

1968
01:25:45.154 --> 01:25:46.254
It's on a transcript, all right?

1969
01:25:46.284 --> 01:25:47.361
Yeah.

1970
01:25:47.391 --> 01:25:49.065
They'll use it against you.
Yes or no.

1971
01:25:49.095 --> 01:25:50.095
What do you think...
Wait a minute, Martin.

1972
01:25:50.125 --> 01:25:52.300
You don't think they're
using it against me now?

1973
01:25:52.330 --> 01:25:54.777
Don't you understand
there's more at stake here?

1974
01:25:54.807 --> 01:25:56.781
Don't you understand
I have a reputation?

1975
01:25:56.811 --> 01:25:58.112
- I have a reputation.
- I'm a star.

1976
01:25:58.142 --> 01:25:59.153
People look at me.

1977
01:25:59.183 --> 01:26:00.383
They also...
They see me as Rocky.

1978
01:26:00.413 --> 01:26:02.692
They don't just see me as Sly
and what they're gonna do

1979
01:26:02.722 --> 01:26:04.191
is they're gonna think
I stole from this guy.

1980
01:26:04.221 --> 01:26:06.729
This guy is stealing from us.
He didn't do anything.

1981
01:26:06.759 --> 01:26:08.906
We don't need Rocky in there.

1982
01:26:08.936 --> 01:26:10.639
- We need me in there.
- It's bigger than that.

1983
01:26:16.384 --> 01:26:17.818
How we doing in there?

1984
01:26:17.848 --> 01:26:19.427
So far, so good.

1985
01:26:19.457 --> 01:26:21.865
He doesn't sound too happy
with me.

1986
01:26:21.895 --> 01:26:23.265
Chuck, that's not your problem.

1987
01:26:24.969 --> 01:26:26.703
I want you to cancel all
our appointments

1988
01:26:26.733 --> 01:26:27.741
for today, all right?

1989
01:26:33.453 --> 01:26:35.955
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1990
01:26:35.985 --> 01:26:37.331
All right.

1991
01:26:37.361 --> 01:26:38.663
Let's continue.

1992
01:26:41.001 --> 01:26:44.378
Um, you're aware

1993
01:26:44.408 --> 01:26:48.787
that Chuck wrestled Andre
the Giant in 1976

1994
01:26:48.817 --> 01:26:51.125
- in Shea Stadium, correct?
- Yeah.

1995
01:26:51.155 --> 01:26:52.957
Yeah, everybody knows that.
It was a big deal.

1996
01:26:52.987 --> 01:26:55.829
Okay, well, didn't Rocky
wrestle a character

1997
01:26:55.859 --> 01:27:00.411
you called "Thunderlips" played
by Hulk Hogan in <i>Rocky III?</i>

1998
01:27:00.441 --> 01:27:02.376
Oh, you guys
are really bottom feeders.

1999
01:27:02.406 --> 01:27:05.048
Is that where you're going
with this? Really?

2000
01:27:05.078 --> 01:27:07.492
Look, Chuck Wepner had nothing.

2001
01:27:07.522 --> 01:27:10.431
Zero. Not a thing to do
with the creation of <i>Rocky.</i>

2002
01:27:10.461 --> 01:27:11.963
And you want to know the truth?

2003
01:27:11.993 --> 01:27:13.070
<i>Rocky was more based</i>

2004
01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:14.067
on Rocky Marciano,
if you wanna know.

2005
01:27:14.097 --> 01:27:16.811
Okay, but you didn't credit
Rocky Marciano

2006
01:27:16.841 --> 01:27:18.208
as being the inspiration
for <i>Rocky.</i>

2007
01:27:18.238 --> 01:27:19.249
So what?

2008
01:27:19.279 --> 01:27:21.482
You credit
my client, Chuck Wepner.

2009
01:27:21.512 --> 01:27:22.523
So what?

2010
01:27:22.553 --> 01:27:23.792
Wepner could take a punch.

2011
01:27:23.822 --> 01:27:24.955
So could a million
other fighters.

2012
01:27:24.985 --> 01:27:25.929
What's the big deal?

2013
01:27:25.959 --> 01:27:27.995
But you didn't credit
a million other fighters

2014
01:27:28.025 --> 01:27:29.231
for inspiring <i>Rocky.</i>

2015
01:27:29.261 --> 01:27:32.337
You credit my client,
Chuck Wepner.

2016
01:27:32.367 --> 01:27:34.180
<i>Rocky was my idea!</i>

2017
01:27:34.210 --> 01:27:36.351
I came up with it. Nobody else.

2018
01:27:36.381 --> 01:27:37.882
You know what, you guys
are really something.

2019
01:27:37.912 --> 01:27:39.084
You know that?
You got me in here.

2020
01:27:39.114 --> 01:27:40.487
This is nothing more than
a shakedown.

2021
01:27:40.517 --> 01:27:41.862
You know that?

2022
01:27:41.892 --> 01:27:43.560
Just answer yes.
He's just doing...

2023
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:46.939
Yeah, but you don't see Ali
suing me over Apollo, do you?

2024
01:27:46.969 --> 01:27:48.476
Look, you know what,
are we done here?

2025
01:27:48.506 --> 01:27:50.040
Are we done? Are you done
with your questions?

2026
01:27:50.070 --> 01:27:50.880
- That's great.
- Okay.

2027
01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:51.778
Okay, that's it,
we're taking a lunch.

2028
01:27:51.808 --> 01:27:53.380
- You know what, I don't want it.
- Okay...

2029
01:27:53.410 --> 01:27:55.286
Ali's lawyer might be
coming to you soon.

2030
01:27:57.625 --> 01:28:00.500
Sly, nothing personal.

2031
01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:02.900
It's no hard feelings.
This is just business.

2032
01:28:02.930 --> 01:28:04.304
You...

2033
01:28:05.473 --> 01:28:06.976
Chuck, you...

2034
01:28:09.382 --> 01:28:11.389
What?

2035
01:28:11.419 --> 01:28:15.130
You play a fighter in the movies
but you ain't no fighter.

2036
01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:17.396
Why don't you do yourself
a favor and go back inside

2037
01:28:17.426 --> 01:28:19.033
before you get hurt?

2038
01:28:25.047 --> 01:28:26.982
You know something, Chuck?

2039
01:28:27.012 --> 01:28:30.962
This is all a bunch of bullshit
and you know it is.

2040
01:28:30.992 --> 01:28:33.100
So I want you to remember this.

2041
01:28:33.130 --> 01:28:35.268
You can get your lawyers
and you can sue me.

2042
01:28:35.969 --> 01:28:37.976
But in the end,

2043
01:28:38.006 --> 01:28:40.181
it ain't gonna matter
'cause nobody...

2044
01:28:40.211 --> 01:28:42.313
nobody's going to
remember you, Chuck.

2045
01:28:42.343 --> 01:28:43.421
And me?

2046
01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:46.127
They're gonna remember me
and you want to know why?

2047
01:28:46.157 --> 01:28:47.426
Because I gave them <i>Rocky.</i>

2048
01:28:48.227 --> 01:28:50.101
I gave them a hero.

2049
01:28:50.131 --> 01:28:52.641
I gave them somebody
to look up to.

2050
01:28:52.671 --> 01:28:55.374
What'd you ever give the world,
Chuck, huh?

2051
01:28:55.404 --> 01:28:57.110
What'd you ever give them?

2052
01:28:57.140 --> 01:28:58.452
Nothing.

2053
01:28:58.482 --> 01:29:00.286
Not a goddamn thing.

2054
01:29:16.151 --> 01:29:18.292
- Guess what we just did?
- No, what?

2055
01:29:18.322 --> 01:29:19.624
We just won summary judgment

2056
01:29:19.654 --> 01:29:22.201
against Sylvester
fucking Stallone!

2057
01:29:22.231 --> 01:29:23.303
You're kidding?

2058
01:29:23.333 --> 01:29:24.566
No, I ain't kidding.

2059
01:29:24.596 --> 01:29:26.577
Yeah!

2060
01:29:26.607 --> 01:29:27.779
Yeah!

2061
01:29:27.809 --> 01:29:29.777
Out! Out!

2062
01:29:29.807 --> 01:29:31.788
Yeah!

2063
01:29:31.818 --> 01:29:33.286
You the man, Rocco.

2064
01:29:34.355 --> 01:29:35.393
Ching, ching.

2065
01:29:35.423 --> 01:29:36.792
<i>It was the final round.</i>

2066
01:29:36.822 --> 01:29:38.534
<i>Stallone fought hard</i>

2067
01:29:38.564 --> 01:29:40.867
<i>but Mango got me off the ropes
and we stood center ring.</i>

2068
01:29:40.897 --> 01:29:43.344
<i>It all came down to this.</i>

2069
01:29:43.374 --> 01:29:47.318
<i>I needed a knockout to win,
to take my life back.</i>

2070
01:29:47.348 --> 01:29:49.852
<i>I heard the judge told them
to come up with a number.</i>

2071
01:29:49.882 --> 01:29:51.828
<i>Otherwise, if they lost,</i>

2072
01:29:51.858 --> 01:29:55.431
<i>she would and her number
would be a very big one.</i>

2073
01:30:31.372 --> 01:30:34.442
<i>And just like that,
down goes Stallone.</i>

2074
01:30:34.472 --> 01:30:35.480
<i>KO.</i>

2075
01:30:36.348 --> 01:30:37.417
Well done.

2076
01:30:44.364 --> 01:30:45.400
Whoo!

2077
01:31:03.638 --> 01:31:04.844
<i>I was never</i>

2078
01:31:04.874 --> 01:31:06.675
<i>the heavyweight
champion of the world.</i>

2079
01:31:06.705 --> 01:31:09.921
<i>I was never a movie star
or a billionaire.</i>

2080
01:31:09.951 --> 01:31:12.258
<i>I was just a regular Joe
from Bayonne</i>

2081
01:31:12.288 --> 01:31:14.560
<i>who went the distance
with Ali and Stallone.</i>

2082
01:31:15.896 --> 01:31:18.499
<i>And that was good enough for me.</i>

2083
01:31:18.529 --> 01:31:22.641
<i>Because in the end,
it's all about the ride</i>

2084
01:31:22.671 --> 01:31:26.919
<i>and God knows
I had me one hell of a ride.</i>

2085
01:31:44.657 --> 01:31:49.657
