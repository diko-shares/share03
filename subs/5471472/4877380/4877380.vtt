You're fucking blowing it,
you understand? Blowing it.

20
00:02:10.327 --> 00:02:11.827
Keep your fucking mitts up.

21
00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:15.635

<i>The Marines.</i>

36
00:02:47.903 --> 00:02:49.506

37
00:02:50.976 --> 00:02:53.380

<i>I figured I'd come home

00:03:06.876 --> 00:03:09.846
<i>Problem was I ain't any good

I want ringside tickets.

48
00:03:17.998 --> 00:03:19.366
Yeah, anything for you, Joe.

When I catch him,

51
00:03:21.906 --> 00:03:22.972
I'm gonna wring
his fucking neck.

52
00:03:22.974 --> 00:03:24.042
Let's rock 'n' roll.

53
00:03:24.044 --> 00:03:26.046
Let's go take care of this

Where's my money, douchebag?

57
00:03:32.394 --> 00:03:33.929
[Joey] Where's my fucking money?

58
00:03:33.931 --> 00:03:35.933
- I don't have it.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

59
00:03:35.935 --> 00:03:38.070
[Chuck] <i>One of my favorite
side jobs was collecting</i>

61
00:03:39.943 --> 00:03:42.813
<i>Welching on Joey G.
was a real bad move.</i>

62
00:03:42.815 --> 00:03:44.015
<i>He was hands-down</i>

63
00:03:44.017 --> 00:03:46.788
<i>the scariest mobster
in New York.</i>

64
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.329
<i>That guy would gouge out
your eye over a nickel.</i>

65
00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.508
[welcher] Joey, Joey, please,
let me explain.

66
00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.510
Look at me.

67
00:03:57.512 --> 00:03:59.715

[Chuck] <i>The Mob

<i>Something to pay the bills.</i>

74

<i>But I knew I didn't want

76
00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.462

You fucking...

81
00:04:34.788 --> 00:04:36.489
Next time,
I'll fucking burn you,

Get your head out of your ass.

95
00:05:02.745 --> 00:05:04.079
Stop throwing wild punches.

96
00:05:04.081 --> 00:05:05.515
Use your strength.

97
00:05:05.517 --> 00:05:07.486
You gotta do defense
like we talked about.

98
00:05:07.488 --> 00:05:08.989
Defense? Fuck that.

99
00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:10.559

[Chuck] <i>The only thing harder

<i>They feel the pain

106
00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:33.573

<i>After Liston, I was invincible.</i>

108
00:05:37.883 --> 00:05:39.117
Are you okay?

109
00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:41.990
Daddy's okay, honey.
Go get ready for school.

110
00:05:41.992 --> 00:05:43.960
- You don't look okay.
- I'm fine.

111
00:05:43.962 --> 00:05:46.034
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

Mom made you breakfast,
remember?

114

Would you look at that?
Jesus fucking Christ.

- Yeah, what are you gonna do?
- What are you gonna do?

118
00:06:06.776 --> 00:06:08.345
I must be late for work.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

120

You're really gonna go
to work right now?

121
00:06:11.652 --> 00:06:14.156
- Are you joking me?
- Look at this dump.

122
00:06:14.158 --> 00:06:15.224
It's not big enough
for all of us.

123
00:06:15.226 --> 00:06:16.961
It's not a dump.
You need to lay down

124
00:06:16.963 --> 00:06:18.230
and you need to heal up.

125
00:06:18.232 --> 00:06:20.201
- Stop.
- I need to pay the bills.

126
00:06:20.203 --> 00:06:22.105
That's what I need to do.

127
00:06:22.107 --> 00:06:24.042
But what about the fight
and the money?

128
00:06:24.044 --> 00:06:26.981
That was, like,
a really big fight, right?

129
00:06:26.983 --> 00:06:29.220
After expenses, it goes fast.

130
00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:30.358
Yeah, I know that.

131
00:06:32.429 --> 00:06:34.099
So why do you do it, then?

132
00:06:34.934 --> 00:06:36.734
You never win.

133
00:06:36.736 --> 00:06:38.071
What's the point?

134
00:06:38.073 --> 00:06:39.173
To look like shit?

135
00:06:39.175 --> 00:06:42.447
No, I don't get it.
I actually don't get it anymore.

136

- Phyllis.
- I don't... What?

137
00:06:44.753 --> 00:06:46.321
- I'm sorry.
- This is what I do.

138
00:06:46.323 --> 00:06:47.189
Do something else.

139
00:06:47.191 --> 00:06:49.193
You're the one
who married a fighter.

140
00:06:49.195 --> 00:06:50.331
Yeah, so what do you think
about Chuck?

141
00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:54.271
- You think he's got a chance?
- Of course. He's tough.

142
00:06:54.273 --> 00:06:55.909
Of course he's got a chance.

143
00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:58.883

00:08:16.441 --> 00:08:18.175
We're gonna have
to stop the fight.

176
00:08:18.177 --> 00:08:20.079
- What?
- Al, I'm stopping this fight.

177
00:08:20.081 --> 00:08:21.316
Don't stop this fight.

178
00:08:21.318 --> 00:08:22.918
It's over. That's it, it's over.

179
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.190
- I'm stopping the fight.
- [Al] Stop the fight.

180
00:08:26.227 --> 00:08:27.462
[Chuck] <i>You don't realize</i>

181
00:08:27.464 --> 00:08:29.265
<i>how banged up you are
in the ring.</i>

182
00:08:29.267 --> 00:08:30.836
<i>It's after that you feel it.</i>

183
00:08:31.906 --> 00:08:33.974
<i>I was banged up bad.</i>

184
00:08:33.976 --> 00:08:36.547
<i>Broke my cheekbone.
Shattered my eye socket.</i>

185
00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.453
<i>Tore me up for 72 stitches.</i>

186
00:08:39.556 --> 00:08:40.589
<i>He got me good.</i>

187
00:08:40.591 --> 00:08:42.325
- [doctor] Stable?
- [nurse] Heart rate's good.

188
00:08:42.327 --> 00:08:43.928
- Blood pressure is good.
- [machine beeps]

189
00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:46.570
- [doctor] You look like shit.
- Aw, thanks, doc.

190
00:08:54.519 --> 00:08:56.388
[Chuck] This big guy.
Come on, give me three.

191
00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.057
That's what I'm talking about.
Kiss me, big guy.

192
00:08:58.059 --> 00:08:59.460
[Donnie] Hey, we got a good
nickname for your daddy.

193
00:08:59.462 --> 00:09:01.196
We're gonna call him
Zipperhead from now on.

194
00:09:01.198 --> 00:09:02.132
[all laughing]

195
00:09:02.134 --> 00:09:04.102
You know, when I was
watching that fight,

196
00:09:04.104 --> 00:09:07.377
I saw my husband getting
the shit kicked out of him,

197
00:09:07.379 --> 00:09:10.183
and living alone
without you in my life.

198
00:09:12.155 --> 00:09:14.558
It's not... It's not normal.

199
00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.227
Phyllis,
what do you want me to do?

200
00:09:16.229 --> 00:09:18.401
I, I don't really want you
to fight anymore.

201
00:09:20.372 --> 00:09:23.008
[Chuck] <i>I was knocking
fighters out left and right.</i>

202
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.080
<i>I had a glimpse of failure
which lit a fire in me.</i>

203
00:09:26.082 --> 00:09:28.487
<i>I knew one day I'd have
to leave boxing,</i>

204
00:09:28.489 --> 00:09:30.359
<i>but I was gonna go out swinging.</i>

205
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.371
You know, this kid
could be champ?

206
00:09:37.373 --> 00:09:38.540
Could be the White Hope.

207
00:09:38.542 --> 00:09:40.344
- No, no, no.
- No?

208
00:09:40.346 --> 00:09:42.816
Don't get ahead of yourself. No.

209
00:09:42.818 --> 00:09:45.588
He's too easy to hit, you know?

210
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:48.327
[Chuck] <i>I fought my way
all the way into the top ten.</i>

211
00:09:48.329 --> 00:09:50.632
<i>I started getting noticed
by all the right people.</i>

212
00:09:50.634 --> 00:09:53.771
<i>I was about to be thrown
into the fight of my life.</i>

213
00:09:53.773 --> 00:09:56.043
<i>And my mom found out before me.</i>

214
00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:58.182
Oh, my god.

215
00:10:01.088 --> 00:10:03.791
[telephone ringing]

216
00:10:03.793 --> 00:10:05.395
[host] <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

217
00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:07.164
<i>the story we're about to see
is true.</i>

218
00:10:07.166 --> 00:10:08.233
<i>The names have been changed...</i>

219
00:10:08.235 --> 00:10:09.302
Hello?

220
00:10:09.304 --> 00:10:10.740
Chuckie, did you see
the newspaper?

221
00:10:10.742 --> 00:10:12.141
[Chuck] <i>No.</i>

222
00:10:12.143 --> 00:10:14.848
You're fighting Muhammad Ali
for the title.

223
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:16.149
[Chuck] <i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

224
00:10:16.151 --> 00:10:18.220
Ali? Mom, Mom, that's...
That's great.

225
00:10:18.222 --> 00:10:19.591
God, I'm so proud of you, honey.

226
00:10:19.593 --> 00:10:22.497
[Chuck] <i>Al Braverman got me
a title shot.</i>

227
00:10:22.499 --> 00:10:24.266
<i>This is what I wanted
my entire life.</i>

228
00:10:24.268 --> 00:10:25.438
Fuck, yeah!

229
00:10:27.475 --> 00:10:29.479
[upbeat music]

230
00:10:32.251 --> 00:10:34.255
[rattles]

231
00:10:42.573 --> 00:10:45.309
[Chuck] <i>Guys like me
never got a chance like this</i>

232
00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:49.184
<i>and I was gonna make damn sure
I didn't blow it.</i>

233
00:10:49.186 --> 00:10:51.489
- [Angelo] Ten-ounce gloves.
- [Muhammad] 22' ring?

234
00:10:51.491 --> 00:10:52.558
22'.

235
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.794
All right, good,
make sure it's 22'

236
00:10:53.796 --> 00:10:55.631
- 'cause I'm gonna be dancing.
- Yeah, I know.

237
00:10:55.633 --> 00:10:56.900
What you doing
eavesdropping on us?

238
00:10:56.902 --> 00:10:57.869
I'm not eavesdropping on you.

239
00:10:57.871 --> 00:11:00.272
I'm just waiting for Al
to do his business.

240
00:11:00.274 --> 00:11:01.342
You and Don are really giving me

241
00:11:01.344 --> 00:11:04.280
a great opportunity here
and I really am thankful.

242
00:11:04.282 --> 00:11:05.718
Stop flattering me, sucker.

243
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.223
There's a nice waiting room
for you downstairs.

244
00:11:08.225 --> 00:11:11.229
All right, thank you, champ.

245
00:11:11.231 --> 00:11:12.666
- Good seeing you, Angelo.
- All right, you too, Chuck.

246
00:11:12.668 --> 00:11:15.270
You are in trouble.

247
00:11:15.272 --> 00:11:17.910
Hey, you're in trouble.

248
00:11:17.912 --> 00:11:19.914
What you talking about, Coach?
I'm the prettiest man alive.

249
00:11:19.916 --> 00:11:20.983
Take care of this.

250
00:11:20.985 --> 00:11:23.488
Man, what you talking about,
coach?

251
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.225
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

252
00:11:26.261 --> 00:11:27.530
I'm champ of the world.

253
00:11:27.532 --> 00:11:29.834
- [Al] <i>Ring size?</i>
- [Angelo] <i>22'.</i>

254
00:11:29.836 --> 00:11:31.003
[door closes]

255
00:11:31.005 --> 00:11:32.274
20'.

256
00:11:32.875 --> 00:11:34.043
22', Al.

257
00:11:34.045 --> 00:11:36.715
Don King told me
you already agreed to 20'.

258
00:11:36.717 --> 00:11:38.719
We've been training in 20'.

259
00:11:38.721 --> 00:11:40.489
My guy likes 22'.

260
00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:42.593
What, he's coming to dance or...
or to fight?

261
00:11:42.595 --> 00:11:44.932
[chuckles]
Look, he's coming to fight.

262
00:11:44.934 --> 00:11:47.804
If Don wants 20', 20'.

263
00:11:47.806 --> 00:11:49.708
Glove size?

264
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.445
- Eight ounces.
- Ten.

265
00:11:51.447 --> 00:11:52.814
Eight ounces.

266
00:11:52.816 --> 00:11:54.818
You might want
an extra two ounces.

267
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.689
My guy hits pretty hard.

268
00:11:56.691 --> 00:11:58.695
[screeching]

269
00:11:59.797 --> 00:12:00.866
[man] Nice.

270
00:12:02.636 --> 00:12:04.638
[Angelo] Come on, move
your feet more. Let's go!

271
00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.908
Yeah, he looks great.

272
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.313
[Angelo]
Get in there! Get in there!

273
00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.455
Beautiful! Beautiful, champ!

274
00:12:12.457 --> 00:12:13.924
Right. Time!

275
00:12:13.926 --> 00:12:15.930
[crowd applause]

276
00:12:16.999 --> 00:12:18.433
Come on!
You gotta work that off.

277
00:12:18.435 --> 00:12:20.003
- You look tired.
- I'm not tired.

278
00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:21.807
- You're not tired?
- Nobody tired.

279
00:12:21.809 --> 00:12:23.612
Ain't nobody tired.
I'm ready to go.

280
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.118
Hey, Al, did we get everything?

281
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.822
Everything we hoped for.

282
00:12:28.824 --> 00:12:30.057
Al, what about ring size?
Glove size?

283
00:12:30.059 --> 00:12:32.430
24' ring. 10-ounce gloves.

284
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.600
24' ring?

285
00:12:34.602 --> 00:12:36.639
How'd you get Angelo Dundee
to agree to a 24' ring?

286
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.675
I lied.

287
00:12:38.677 --> 00:12:39.944
[Chuck] <i>This fight
was gonna be different.</i>

288
00:12:39.946 --> 00:12:41.948
<i>I was gonna make
a big enough payday</i>

289
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:43.685
<i>to be able to train full-time.</i>

290
00:12:43.687 --> 00:12:45.889
<i>Believe it or not, the Ali fight
was the first one</i>

291
00:12:45.891 --> 00:12:47.659
<i>I ever got to train
for full-time.</i>

292
00:12:47.661 --> 00:12:49.563
All right,
back-to-back training.

293
00:12:49.565 --> 00:12:51.167
Let him dance.
He wants to dance.

294
00:12:51.169 --> 00:12:54.173
He wants to be a butterfly,
let him be a butterfly.

295
00:12:54.175 --> 00:12:56.210
[Al] Don't try to go
for the knockout.

296
00:12:56.212 --> 00:12:57.112
It's never gonna happen.

297
00:12:57.114 --> 00:12:58.782
- Come on! Come on!
- [Al] He's too fast.

298
00:12:58.784 --> 00:13:00.053
His reach is too far.

299
00:13:02.091 --> 00:13:04.194
- All right, Al.
- Body shot.

300
00:13:04.196 --> 00:13:05.765
- You're all right?
- I'm all right.

301
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.214
[Chuck] <i>For the first time
in my life, I was ready.</i>

302
00:13:14.216 --> 00:13:16.184
<i>I was ready for Ali,</i>

303
00:13:16.186 --> 00:13:19.825
<i>and I was gonna show the world
I belonged on this stage.</i>

304
00:13:19.827 --> 00:13:22.032
Jesus Christ,
keep your hands up!

305
00:13:22.833 --> 00:13:24.234
[Al] That's it.

306
00:13:24.236 --> 00:13:25.504
[trainer] Come on, dish.

307
00:13:25.506 --> 00:13:26.574
Finish with the left hook.

308
00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:33.722
[Al] Keep your hands up, Chuck!

309
00:13:36.528 --> 00:13:37.461
Put it up there.

310
00:13:37.463 --> 00:13:39.131
When you throw your left,
you're always...

311
00:13:39.133 --> 00:13:40.200
you're dropping your right.

312
00:13:40.202 --> 00:13:41.269
Don't drop your right

313
00:13:41.271 --> 00:13:42.739
'cause you throw your left
and then you're open.

314
00:13:42.741 --> 00:13:43.808
You're open, right?

315
00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:45.210
So every time
you throw that left,

316
00:13:45.212 --> 00:13:47.615
make sure you're keeping
this here and then salute.

317
00:13:47.617 --> 00:13:50.153
Go back.
You strike back but salute.

318
00:13:50.155 --> 00:13:51.223
I want you to salute.

319
00:13:51.225 --> 00:13:52.292
Every time you throw
a punch, salute.

320
00:13:52.294 --> 00:13:53.561
Like you're saluting.

321
00:13:53.563 --> 00:13:54.663
Keep that hand up

322
00:13:54.665 --> 00:13:56.002
because I can't hit you
that way.

323
00:13:57.905 --> 00:13:59.606
Are you preparing for Wepner?

324
00:13:59.608 --> 00:14:00.976
Well, I plan on bringing a mop
to the ring

325
00:14:00.978 --> 00:14:03.247
so I can soak up all that blood
he's gonna spill on me.

326
00:14:03.249 --> 00:14:04.650
Cassius, uh, Cassius...

327
00:14:04.652 --> 00:14:05.819
Ain't nobody answering
your question, man.

328
00:14:05.821 --> 00:14:07.288
It's Muhammad Ali.

329
00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.026
- Get this guy out of here.
- You gotta go.

330
00:14:09.028 --> 00:14:10.330
[Chuck] <i>Ali wasn't nervous.</i>

331
00:14:10.332 --> 00:14:12.767
<i>He should've been,
but he wasn't.</i>

332
00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:14.704
<i>He was always playing it cool.</i>

333
00:14:14.706 --> 00:14:15.973
He ain't got no chance.
I'm the greatest of all time.

334
00:14:15.975 --> 00:14:17.879
I'm the prettiest.
He can't possibly beat me.

335
00:14:21.253 --> 00:14:22.753
[Chuck] <i>See, Ali thought</i>

336
00:14:22.755 --> 00:14:24.057
<i>he was gonna mop the floor up
with me.</i>

337
00:14:24.059 --> 00:14:26.161
<i>He was out there eating.
Gaining weight.</i>

338
00:14:26.163 --> 00:14:27.831
<i>He thought it was gonna be
a cakewalk,</i>

339
00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:29.067
<i>but I knew different.</i>

340
00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:30.135
That's it.

341
00:14:30.137 --> 00:14:33.041
Always finish strong, baby,
with the left, yes.

342
00:14:33.043 --> 00:14:34.878
You got it.
Finish off with the left hook.

343
00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.949
I want to see
that double left hook.

344
00:14:37.353 --> 00:14:39.655
You know, they're calling you
the, the Bleeder.

345
00:14:39.657 --> 00:14:40.890
[Chuck] <i>My brother, Donnie.</i>

346
00:14:40.892 --> 00:14:42.395
Stupid fucking name.

347
00:14:42.397 --> 00:14:44.365
[Chuck] <i>As many times
as I get punched in the head,</i>

348
00:14:44.367 --> 00:14:46.403
<i>I still couldn't be as stupid
as that guy.</i>

349
00:14:46.405 --> 00:14:48.673
Hey, you're a 40-to-1 underdog.

350
00:14:48.675 --> 00:14:50.711
Maybe I should place a bet.

351
00:14:50.713 --> 00:14:52.182
As long as you bet on me,
Donnie.

352
00:14:54.421 --> 00:14:56.426
[calm music]

353
00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:02.303
[upbeat music]

354
00:15:03.706 --> 00:15:05.408
Man, you look nervous.

355
00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:07.078
You never been on national TV?

356
00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.149
No, I never have,
but I'm, I'm doing all right.

357
00:15:09.151 --> 00:15:10.217
I just, you know,
maybe just a little...

358
00:15:10.219 --> 00:15:11.153
Ah, well, don't worry about it.

359
00:15:11.155 --> 00:15:12.021
Man, you ain't got nothing
to worry about.

360
00:15:12.023 --> 00:15:14.894
Piece of cake.
Done it a hundred times.

361
00:15:14.896 --> 00:15:16.731
Thanks, champ. I'll do my best.

362
00:15:16.733 --> 00:15:18.000
All right, now, when we get out
on that stage,

363
00:15:18.002 --> 00:15:19.338
now, I'm gonna need you
to call me nigger.

364
00:15:22.177 --> 00:15:23.043
Come on, now, don't act

365
00:15:23.045 --> 00:15:23.945
like you ain't
never said it before.

366
00:15:23.947 --> 00:15:24.914
I'm gonna need you
to call me a nigger.

367
00:15:24.916 --> 00:15:27.152
I don't... I don't think
that's a good idea.

368
00:15:27.154 --> 00:15:28.522
- I mean, I...
- Chuck, we gotta give the press

369
00:15:28.524 --> 00:15:30.158
something to holler about,
all right?

370
00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.962
I don't want you to be boring.

371
00:15:31.964 --> 00:15:34.035
Get with the program, now.
Come on.

372
00:15:34.903 --> 00:15:36.405
Let's do it for TV.

373
00:15:36.407 --> 00:15:39.844
Do it for Don King.
Do it for Great White America.

374
00:15:39.846 --> 00:15:42.015
Don't be a big disappointment,
Chuck.

375
00:15:42.017 --> 00:15:44.422
It's good for business.
Come on, sucker.

376
00:15:44.424 --> 00:15:46.858
I mean, I, uh...
Oh, all right, all right.

377
00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.530
- It's going to be like that.
- Let's do it for business.

378
00:15:48.532 --> 00:15:49.965
[Angelo] How you doing, Chuck?

379
00:15:49.967 --> 00:15:51.235
I'm doing well, Angelo.
How are you?

380
00:15:51.237 --> 00:15:53.305
[Angelo] Very good, thanks.

381
00:15:53.307 --> 00:15:55.577
You know, this guy wants me to,
you know, say the...

382
00:15:55.579 --> 00:15:57.514
the N-word, you know, on stage,

383
00:15:57.516 --> 00:16:00.186
but I don't know if that's
a very good idea, you know.

384
00:16:00.188 --> 00:16:02.123
Do what the champ tells you.

385
00:16:02.125 --> 00:16:03.929
If he told you to,
would you do it?

386
00:16:04.831 --> 00:16:05.899
Yeah.

387
00:16:07.471 --> 00:16:09.137
Chuck, are you nervous?
You're looking good.

388
00:16:09.139 --> 00:16:10.941
What, are you kidding me?
You think I'm nervous?

389
00:16:10.943 --> 00:16:12.545
I get punched in the face
for a living, all right.

390
00:16:12.547 --> 00:16:13.547
Hey, checking on the dress.

391
00:16:13.549 --> 00:16:14.549
What's going on, Chuck?
What's going on, bud?

392
00:16:14.551 --> 00:16:16.286
- Oh, I'm doing well, Don.
- Okay, all right.

393
00:16:16.288 --> 00:16:17.389
Good, good, good.

394
00:16:17.391 --> 00:16:19.158
Hey, look, give a good show
out there, all right?

395
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.093
All right.

396
00:16:20.095 --> 00:16:22.097
All right,
don't fucking shuffle me, now.

397
00:16:22.099 --> 00:16:23.233
I'll beat
the fucking shit out, boy.

398
00:16:23.235 --> 00:16:24.235
I'll break both your legs.

399
00:16:24.237 --> 00:16:25.304
You'll be crawling
out the studio, okay, boy?

400
00:16:25.306 --> 00:16:27.308
Come on, I thought you were
over that jazz, Don.

401
00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:28.310
Yeah, no, no.

402
00:16:28.312 --> 00:16:30.013
- You have a great show, okay?
- [Chuck] I will.

403
00:16:30.015 --> 00:16:31.215
[Muhammad] Yeah, we don't
get along too good.

404
00:16:31.217 --> 00:16:32.486
I heard about him.

405
00:16:32.488 --> 00:16:33.921
Uh, he's a white fella,
you know,

406
00:16:33.923 --> 00:16:35.392
he don't care too much
about colored people.

407
00:16:35.394 --> 00:16:37.630
Yeah, I... I heard
he called you Cassius Clay.

408
00:16:37.632 --> 00:16:39.266
No, he called me something else.

409
00:16:39.268 --> 00:16:40.938
You ain't heard
what he said last week.

410
00:16:41.907 --> 00:16:43.076
He called me a nigger.

411
00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:46.280
Huh, I guess this is going to be
a real fight.

412
00:16:46.282 --> 00:16:48.485
I, you know, I did not say that.
I did not say that.

413
00:16:48.487 --> 00:16:49.921
It's on the record
to be straight

414
00:16:49.923 --> 00:16:51.023
that I did not say that.

415
00:16:51.025 --> 00:16:52.527
- Here he is, uh, the challenger.
- [audience applause]

416
00:16:52.529 --> 00:16:55.031
Mr. Chuck Wepner,
welcome to the show.

417
00:16:55.033 --> 00:16:56.202
Thanks, it's good to be here.

418
00:16:58.106 --> 00:16:59.508
Oh, okay,
it's gonna be like that.

419
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.612
Okay, so, uh, is there
any truth that you said

420
00:17:01.614 --> 00:17:03.383
- any of these terrible things?
- Absolutely not.

421
00:17:03.385 --> 00:17:05.219
- Yeah, he said it. He said it.
- Not at all. I did not say that.

422
00:17:05.221 --> 00:17:06.287
He said it just to show
his name.

423
00:17:06.289 --> 00:17:08.091
Hey, listen, you're trying
to be in my interview.

424
00:17:08.093 --> 00:17:09.227
This is my after one
interview talks.

425
00:17:09.229 --> 00:17:10.597
- Equal opportunity.
- You're boring.

426
00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:11.966
- You're boring.
- [Chuck] Oh, I'm boring.

427
00:17:11.968 --> 00:17:13.101
Nobody wants to hear you talk.

428
00:17:13.103 --> 00:17:14.338
Yeah, take your jacket off

429
00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:16.040
because everyone's gonna see
how fat you are on the camera.

430
00:17:16.042 --> 00:17:17.345
Oh, you wanna do this now?

431
00:17:17.347 --> 00:17:18.447
Is that what we're doing?

432
00:17:18.449 --> 00:17:20.250
Guys, sit down. Sit down.

433
00:17:20.252 --> 00:17:22.019
Fellas, let's play nice.

434
00:17:22.021 --> 00:17:23.156
- Keep talking.
- Let's play nice.

435
00:17:23.158 --> 00:17:24.023
All right, all right,
I'm here any time you want it.

436
00:17:24.025 --> 00:17:26.329
- Have a seat.
- All right, here we go.

437
00:17:26.331 --> 00:17:27.698
Yeah, we're friends here, right?

438
00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:28.835
Tell me a little bit more
about yourself.

439
00:17:28.837 --> 00:17:32.140
Uh, I was, uh, born and raised
in Bayonne, New Jersey.

440
00:17:32.142 --> 00:17:37.083
- I'm a Golden Gloves champion.
- [yawns]

441
00:17:37.085 --> 00:17:38.455
Champ, come on.

442
00:17:38.457 --> 00:17:39.523
A little respect to this guy.

443
00:17:39.525 --> 00:17:40.625
Can we get a chance to talk

444
00:17:40.627 --> 00:17:41.727
'cause I thought
they want to know.

445
00:17:41.729 --> 00:17:44.199
He knocked out a lot of guys
that knocked you out.

446
00:17:44.201 --> 00:17:45.368
Hey, I've never been
knocked out.

447
00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:46.604
I've been cut.
Never knocked out.

448
00:17:46.606 --> 00:17:48.073
This guy,
I'm gonna knock him out.

449
00:17:48.075 --> 00:17:49.510
That's right, no, you will...
you will try.

450
00:17:49.512 --> 00:17:50.612
You will get your chance.

451
00:17:50.614 --> 00:17:51.814
[Chuck] Oh, I'm gonna be there.
You better be there.

452
00:17:51.816 --> 00:17:53.752
- No, you're gonna be there.
- [Chuck] I'm gonna be there.

453
00:17:53.754 --> 00:17:54.821
I'm gonna whip the floor...

454
00:17:54.823 --> 00:17:56.089
I'm gonna wipe
the floor with you.

455
00:17:56.091 --> 00:17:57.158
I'm gonna wipe
the ring with you.

456
00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.495
Ain't no way in the world
you're gonna whip me.

457
00:17:58.497 --> 00:17:59.831
[audience laughing]

458
00:17:59.833 --> 00:18:02.804
Hey, who's that silky bastard?

459
00:18:02.806 --> 00:18:05.610
- What, are you kidding me?
- [Al] Time!

460
00:18:05.612 --> 00:18:08.080
Sorry, Al. I'm on the cover
of <i>Sports Illustrated.</i>

461
00:18:08.082 --> 00:18:09.584
I got another cover for you.

462
00:18:09.586 --> 00:18:12.524
You spread-eagle on the canvas,
knocked out by Ali

463
00:18:12.526 --> 00:18:14.694
because you didn't train
for the fight.

464
00:18:14.696 --> 00:18:17.199
Because you're here entertaining
your idiot brother

465
00:18:17.201 --> 00:18:18.737
when you should be jumping rope.

466
00:18:18.739 --> 00:18:21.240
He's contending for the
heavyweight championship

467
00:18:21.242 --> 00:18:22.845
of the world and you're coming

468
00:18:22.847 --> 00:18:24.549
and putting this shit
into his head!

469
00:18:24.551 --> 00:18:25.817
You need to learn
how to protect my brother.

470
00:18:25.819 --> 00:18:27.488
He's in the...
in the ring getting beat up.

471
00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:28.390
Can you teach him how to move?

472
00:18:28.392 --> 00:18:29.525
You're distracting
my fucking fighter!

473
00:18:29.527 --> 00:18:33.333
Not my job. Maybe you
should learn to protect my...

474
00:18:33.335 --> 00:18:35.236
Donnie, I don't like it
when you're here.

475
00:18:35.238 --> 00:18:36.606
You want a new trainer?

476
00:18:36.608 --> 00:18:37.775
No, no, Al, I'm sorry.

477
00:18:37.777 --> 00:18:39.412
Then get that fucking moron
out of here.

478
00:18:39.414 --> 00:18:41.583
Get out of here, Donnie!
I'm sorry, Al.

479
00:18:41.585 --> 00:18:42.518
You know, he's my brother.

480
00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.623
Good, get on the ropes.
Three minutes now!

481
00:18:44.625 --> 00:18:46.894
[Al] This is the heavyweight
championship of the world.

482
00:18:46.896 --> 00:18:48.396
You're not gonna go in there
and knock him out.

483
00:18:48.398 --> 00:18:50.266
This is Muhammad fucking Ali.

484
00:18:50.268 --> 00:18:51.637
You're gonna hit body shots.

485
00:18:51.639 --> 00:18:54.509
You gotta concentrate
on his, on his weaknesses.

486
00:18:54.511 --> 00:18:56.547
And he doesn't have any.

487
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:57.916
I'm taking this seriously, Al.

488
00:18:57.918 --> 00:18:59.519
I know it's a different
kind of fight for me.

489
00:18:59.521 --> 00:19:01.255
[Al] Yeah, that means
no drinking,

490
00:19:01.257 --> 00:19:03.195
no drugging, no fucking around.

491
00:19:04.632 --> 00:19:06.400
I have a responsibility
to be a leader

492
00:19:06.402 --> 00:19:07.837
and so do you, Don King.

493
00:19:07.839 --> 00:19:09.173
That's right.

494
00:19:10.209 --> 00:19:11.778
That's why I take this serious.

495
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:12.913
It's not all about fun and games

496
00:19:12.915 --> 00:19:14.316
if you see me on TV laughing

497
00:19:14.318 --> 00:19:16.354
and cracking jokes
with Howard Cosell.

498
00:19:16.356 --> 00:19:19.360
He gets paid
to laugh and crack jokes.

499
00:19:19.362 --> 00:19:21.831
I get paid
to help my people out.

500
00:19:21.833 --> 00:19:24.637
You know, I'm not going to be
a politician for this country

501
00:19:24.639 --> 00:19:26.708
because this country hadn't done
nothing for black folks,

502
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:27.844
never did nothing
for black folks.

503
00:19:27.846 --> 00:19:28.780
All they did was take us
from our land.

504
00:19:28.782 --> 00:19:31.351
Why would I go over there
to the Viet Cong

505
00:19:31.353 --> 00:19:32.420
and kill all those people?

506
00:19:32.422 --> 00:19:33.489
They ain't never did
nothing to us.

507
00:19:33.491 --> 00:19:34.858
No, you're right.

508
00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.562
You the ones...
You the ones that lynched us.

509
00:19:36.564 --> 00:19:37.497
You the ones that robbed us.

510
00:19:37.499 --> 00:19:38.766
You the ones
that went over to, to Africa

511
00:19:38.768 --> 00:19:41.605
where we was kings and queens
and you took us from over there

512
00:19:41.607 --> 00:19:43.710
and you brought us over here
for 400 years of slavery

513
00:19:43.712 --> 00:19:46.281
and now you want me to sit here
and act like I love y'all?

514
00:19:46.283 --> 00:19:48.753
No, I do not love y'all.
I will not fight for you.

515
00:19:48.755 --> 00:19:50.590
I will help my black people out.

516
00:19:50.592 --> 00:19:51.659
It's always gonna be
black people first.

517
00:19:51.661 --> 00:19:54.565
I'm sorry, but that's just
the way it's gonna be.

518
00:19:54.567 --> 00:19:55.935
- You're right. We gotta fight.
- [Belinda] It's true, baby.

519
00:19:55.937 --> 00:19:57.805
We gotta fight for,
for our rights

520
00:19:57.807 --> 00:19:59.576
because that's what we deserve.

521
00:19:59.578 --> 00:20:02.949
We deserve to be
kings and queens.

522
00:20:02.951 --> 00:20:04.686
[Don] That's right, champ.
You're right.

523
00:20:04.688 --> 00:20:06.089
[Muhammad] Maybe someday there
will be a black president.

524
00:20:06.091 --> 00:20:07.158
- Who knows?
- [Don] Oh, yeah.

525
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.529
Maybe because I only helped
this poor white boy

526
00:20:09.531 --> 00:20:11.733
out in this fight and they see
that we can help them out.

527
00:20:11.735 --> 00:20:12.938
Amen to that.

528
00:20:13.874 --> 00:20:14.940
You know what, champ?

529
00:20:14.942 --> 00:20:16.545
You're the smartest fighter
I know.

530
00:20:17.648 --> 00:20:19.115
Well, let's try
to keep it that way.

531
00:20:19.117 --> 00:20:21.355
All right, all right.
[laughs]

532
00:20:23.092 --> 00:20:24.693
Now, we are all here
for the world

533
00:20:24.695 --> 00:20:25.796
heavyweight championship

534
00:20:25.798 --> 00:20:28.668
between Muhammad Ali
and the contender, Chuck Wepner.

535
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.472
Currently ranked eighth
in the world

536
00:20:30.474 --> 00:20:32.011
and they call him
the Great White Hope.

537
00:20:40.561 --> 00:20:41.962
That's it?

538
00:20:41.964 --> 00:20:45.503
- Here.
- This is the one.

539
00:20:45.505 --> 00:20:48.107
We're here at the
Cleveland Coliseum

540
00:20:48.109 --> 00:20:51.515
for the weigh-in
of the heavyweight championship

541
00:20:51.517 --> 00:20:55.723
between the champion
Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner.

542
00:20:55.725 --> 00:20:57.560
- Muhammad Ali...
- Yeah, I'm fat.

543
00:20:57.562 --> 00:21:00.666
You heard all about that?
How fat I am?

544
00:21:00.668 --> 00:21:01.635
- All right...
- Don't touch me.

545
00:21:01.637 --> 00:21:02.637
Don't touch me.
Now, you've been wigging...

546
00:21:02.639 --> 00:21:05.076
You've been jawing me
for a long time, now.

547
00:21:05.078 --> 00:21:06.178
One of these days,

548
00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.148
I'm gonna take that toupee off
of your forehead.

549
00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:09.819
All right, all right, let's...
let's weigh him.

550
00:21:09.821 --> 00:21:11.221
[Muhammad] I'm on the scale.
I'm on the scale.

551
00:21:11.223 --> 00:21:12.558
All right.

552
00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.962
- 227.
- That is the official weight

553
00:21:14.964 --> 00:21:17.101
- of Muhammad...
- I, I am boxing.

554
00:21:17.103 --> 00:21:18.971
He's not fighting
the challenger.

555
00:21:18.973 --> 00:21:20.641
He's challenging boxing.

556
00:21:20.643 --> 00:21:24.615
He's challenging one 227 pounds.

557
00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:27.021
- [Muhammad] Man, I'm sorry, man.
- That is six pounds heavier

558
00:21:27.023 --> 00:21:29.960
than when Ali
fought George Foreman.

559
00:21:29.962 --> 00:21:31.597
[Muhammad] Man, there's
too much soul in here.

560
00:21:31.599 --> 00:21:32.966
[Chuck] <i>Everybody thinks
that the training,</i>

561
00:21:32.968 --> 00:21:35.203
<i>the time in,
that that's the hardest part.</i>

562
00:21:35.205 --> 00:21:37.141
223-and-a-half.

563
00:21:37.143 --> 00:21:39.011
You're too light.
You're lightweight.

564
00:21:39.013 --> 00:21:40.782
- And you're too heavy.
- That ain't enough for me.

565
00:21:40.784 --> 00:21:42.786
You need to eat
some more cookies.

566
00:21:42.788 --> 00:21:46.593
[Chuck] <i>But really, it's the
quiet before fight night.</i>

567
00:21:46.595 --> 00:21:48.531
<i>It's those hours
when you're thinking</i>

568
00:21:48.533 --> 00:21:51.236
<i>about everything
that led up to this.</i>

569
00:21:51.238 --> 00:21:54.242
<i>It's about spending time
with the people you love</i>

570
00:21:54.244 --> 00:21:55.948
<i>and praying
you don't let them down.</i>

571
00:21:58.554 --> 00:21:59.956
[Chuck] Why?
You worried about me?

572
00:22:02.662 --> 00:22:04.597
Of course,
I'm worried about you.

573
00:22:04.599 --> 00:22:06.335
[Chuck sighs]

574
00:22:06.337 --> 00:22:08.906
I mean, you know he's got way
more experience

575
00:22:08.908 --> 00:22:10.209
than you and you know that.

576
00:22:10.211 --> 00:22:11.678
He knocked Sonny Liston

577
00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.916
out in one round, baby,
one round.

578
00:22:13.918 --> 00:22:15.856
And what did Sonny
do to you, hmm?

579
00:22:17.191 --> 00:22:19.928
He broke your fucking face
in half.

580
00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.166
I think I can beat Ali.

581
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:24.206
I know you can.

582
00:22:30.786 --> 00:22:32.089
Baby, I got you something.

583
00:22:47.787 --> 00:22:49.856
Hey, darling. How are you?

584
00:22:49.858 --> 00:22:51.059
Hey, how you doing?
Good to see you.

585
00:22:51.061 --> 00:22:53.197
Good to see you, too.

586
00:22:53.199 --> 00:22:56.069
- Champ, good luck on the fight.
- I'm going to.

587
00:22:56.071 --> 00:22:57.071
How you doing, champ?

588
00:22:57.073 --> 00:22:58.674
How you feeling, baby?
How you feeling, baby?

589
00:22:58.676 --> 00:22:59.777
Come on, man, I'm the champ.

590
00:22:59.779 --> 00:23:02.014
- You know how I feel.
- Yeah, I know, baby, I know.

591
00:23:02.016 --> 00:23:03.451
So it's gonna be...
It's gonna be a great fight.

592
00:23:03.453 --> 00:23:04.720
[Don] I just can't wait
for this one.

593
00:23:04.722 --> 00:23:05.789
Well, that's the way
it should be.

594
00:23:05.791 --> 00:23:06.724
You know what I'm saying?

595
00:23:06.726 --> 00:23:07.926
You're gonna give everybody
a good show.

596
00:23:07.928 --> 00:23:08.828
Ain't nobody worried

597
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:10.064
about nothing in this room
right here.

598
00:23:10.066 --> 00:23:11.234
Absolutely, champ.
You're all good.

599
00:23:11.236 --> 00:23:14.306
All right, Angelo, just make
sure you don't be uptight.

600
00:23:14.308 --> 00:23:16.744
[Chuck] <i>This was the biggest
fight of my life,</i>

601
00:23:16.746 --> 00:23:19.750
<i>where fate would decide
if I became a legend...</i>

602
00:23:19.752 --> 00:23:22.359
<i>or just another kid from Bayonne
who life kicks the shit out of.</i>

603
00:23:25.398 --> 00:23:27.402
[upbeat music]

604
00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:33.814
[audience cheer]

605
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:49.414
[Muhammad] The champ is here.

606
00:23:51.952 --> 00:23:53.221
Boo for me.

607
00:23:55.091 --> 00:23:56.728
All right, let's go.

608
00:24:00.102 --> 00:24:02.106
[audience cheer]

609
00:24:03.809 --> 00:24:04.979
[bell dings]

610
00:24:05.981 --> 00:24:07.181
[commentator] Round one.

611
00:24:07.183 --> 00:24:08.884
The bell sounds and here we go.

612
00:24:08.886 --> 00:24:10.521
Wepner comes bouncing
across the ring

613
00:24:10.523 --> 00:24:12.926
and looks as though he wants
to be aggressive right away.

614
00:24:12.928 --> 00:24:14.597
Ali known for slow starts,

615
00:24:14.599 --> 00:24:17.167
circling ever so patent
to the left.

616
00:24:17.169 --> 00:24:19.140
He'll try and convert early,
it looks like.

617
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.145
Come on.
Now wipe this honky, Clay.

618
00:24:22.147 --> 00:24:23.848
[commentator]
<i>Let's not forget one thing.</i>

619
00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:26.988
- You're a bunch of turncoats.
- <i>Ali's a smart...</i>

620
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:28.092
- Turncoats.
- <i>But he does put on a display.</i>

621
00:24:29.596 --> 00:24:31.163
[commentator] Wepner will look
slow and awkward

622
00:24:31.165 --> 00:24:32.633
because he is slow and awkward

623
00:24:32.635 --> 00:24:34.337
but he does
seem to be hanging on.

624
00:24:34.339 --> 00:24:35.607
There we go.

625
00:24:35.609 --> 00:24:38.044
It looks like Tony Perez
has warned the lead

626
00:24:38.046 --> 00:24:39.615
about hitting behind the head.

627
00:24:39.617 --> 00:24:41.419
Ali cruises himself around.

628
00:24:41.421 --> 00:24:43.525
Took him on a flight
before this round's over.

629
00:24:45.895 --> 00:24:47.531
<i>Ali's hands are a little quick.</i>

630
00:24:47.533 --> 00:24:48.899
Yeah, he can counter so fast

631
00:24:48.901 --> 00:24:50.337
that it makes it difficult
for Wepner.

632
00:24:50.339 --> 00:24:52.407
This is a heavyweight
championship fight

633
00:24:52.409 --> 00:24:54.077
slated for 15 rounds.

634
00:24:54.079 --> 00:24:55.681
You had that one. Come on, baby.

635
00:24:55.683 --> 00:24:57.016
[commentator]
Can Ali knock out this man?

636
00:24:57.018 --> 00:24:58.053
Many people say no.

637
00:25:03.599 --> 00:25:06.403
The exhausted factor
as they go to round nine.

638
00:25:06.405 --> 00:25:08.105
Ali slips a punch to his left.

639
00:25:08.107 --> 00:25:10.580
Oh, a vicious shot to the ribs
of Muhammad Ali.

640
00:25:11.615 --> 00:25:13.617
- And what a surprise.
- [thuds]

641
00:25:13.619 --> 00:25:16.155
[commentator] Chuck Wepner gets
to the body of Muhammad Ali.

642
00:25:16.157 --> 00:25:18.527
Let's see what happened here.
We're gonna count.

643
00:25:18.529 --> 00:25:21.466
Six, seven, and now a minute
into the eight count.

644
00:25:21.468 --> 00:25:23.302
[Joey] Yeah! Yeah!

645
00:25:23.304 --> 00:25:25.475
You see that? You see that?
You see him? You see Chuck?

646
00:25:25.477 --> 00:25:27.177
[commentator] Ali's gonna have
to get off his haunches...

647
00:25:27.179 --> 00:25:29.417
[Chuck]
<i>I couldn't believe it. Ali fell.</i>

648
00:25:29.419 --> 00:25:31.387
<i>For a second, I thought,
"If it bleeds,</i>

649
00:25:31.389 --> 00:25:33.391
<i>I could kill it
and maybe this guy</i>

650
00:25:33.393 --> 00:25:35.294
<i>isn't as invincible
as he says he is.</i>

651
00:25:35.296 --> 00:25:38.568
[crowd cheering]

652
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:41.206
[Joey] We got him! We got him!
We got him! We got him!

653
00:25:41.208 --> 00:25:44.447
Start the car, Al.
We're gonna be rich.

654
00:25:44.449 --> 00:25:47.253
[Chuck] <i>I thought that
for a second and then...</i>

655
00:25:48.458 --> 00:25:50.257
<i>Then he got back up.</i>

656
00:25:50.259 --> 00:25:52.296
[commentator] Ali has horsed
around and horsed around

657
00:25:52.298 --> 00:25:55.338
and was warned
by his corner not to do that.

658
00:25:57.576 --> 00:25:58.576
Muhammad Ali went down

659
00:25:58.578 --> 00:26:00.682
from a vicious right hand
thrown by Wepner.

660
00:26:01.417 --> 00:26:03.053
Ali is agitated.

661
00:26:05.458 --> 00:26:07.092
He thinks this is for real.

662
00:26:07.094 --> 00:26:08.563
Nobody worried
about that, chump.

663
00:26:08.565 --> 00:26:09.699
You're the champ of the world.
He's nobody.

664
00:26:09.701 --> 00:26:10.567
I know.

665
00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:13.573
Do like what we worked on, okay?
Defense.

666
00:26:13.575 --> 00:26:15.744
Use your defense.
Keep your mitts up.

667
00:26:15.746 --> 00:26:17.416
[Al] Use the body shots.

668
00:26:21.156 --> 00:26:22.225
[bell dings]

669
00:26:24.531 --> 00:26:26.867
[Joey] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

670
00:26:26.869 --> 00:26:28.771
[commentator] It looks like
Wepner's in trouble now.

671
00:26:28.773 --> 00:26:29.840
He's staggering.

672
00:26:29.842 --> 00:26:31.376
Ali goes to work
with the right hand.

673
00:26:31.378 --> 00:26:33.446
Wepner's in trouble.

674
00:26:33.448 --> 00:26:35.685
Ali throws another
right hand right to the eye.

675
00:26:35.687 --> 00:26:37.889
There's a left hook.
Another left hook. Misses.

676
00:26:37.891 --> 00:26:39.826
Wepner continues to come on.

677
00:26:39.828 --> 00:26:41.463
Ali's final 30-second flurry

678
00:26:41.465 --> 00:26:43.233
won't win him the round, though.

679
00:26:43.235 --> 00:26:44.638
What a great round of boxing.

680
00:26:47.209 --> 00:26:48.413
He's in trouble.

681
00:26:49.648 --> 00:26:51.350
He's in big trouble.

682
00:26:51.352 --> 00:26:54.791
[commentator] Ali's not tired.
Wepner is tired.

683
00:26:54.793 --> 00:26:56.695
Ali has scored many more points.

684
00:26:56.697 --> 00:26:57.830
Come on, bro!

685
00:26:57.832 --> 00:27:00.536
I'm surprised knockdown so far
has been the scoring.

686
00:27:00.538 --> 00:27:02.809
That's my husband right there.

687
00:27:09.321 --> 00:27:11.290
[commentator]
Great uppercut by Ali.

688
00:27:11.292 --> 00:27:13.695
Wepner wants Ali so bad
he can taste it,

689
00:27:13.697 --> 00:27:15.599
but he doesn't have
the ability to do it.

690
00:27:15.601 --> 00:27:18.472
Ali does have
the God-given ability.

691
00:27:18.474 --> 00:27:19.975
Ali looked awkward that time.

692
00:27:19.977 --> 00:27:21.310
Wepner has his hands up
and says,

693
00:27:21.312 --> 00:27:23.449
"Is that the best you can do?"

694
00:27:23.451 --> 00:27:25.954
Wepner's a tough kid,
there's no doubt about it.

695
00:27:25.956 --> 00:27:29.361
I have a tremendous respect
for the courage of this man.

696
00:27:29.363 --> 00:27:31.567
Ali has no respect
for his ability.

697
00:27:32.369 --> 00:27:33.670
Ali wants the knockout.

698
00:27:33.672 --> 00:27:35.440
He wants to knock him out
so bad.

699
00:27:35.442 --> 00:27:37.511
Ali trying to keep him
in punching distance now

700
00:27:37.513 --> 00:27:40.585
which tells me he wants
to finish this thing right now.

701
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.001
Ali crosses with a right
to the dome

702
00:27:49.003 --> 00:27:51.339
and tapped the head of Wepner.

703
00:27:51.341 --> 00:27:53.009
Ali definitely wants to finish.

704
00:27:53.011 --> 00:27:54.679
There's a great combination.

705
00:27:54.681 --> 00:27:55.915
Wepner's ready to go.

706
00:27:55.917 --> 00:27:58.020
He's ready to go. Ali comes on.

707
00:27:58.022 --> 00:27:59.591
Wepner is staggering.

708
00:28:00.526 --> 00:28:01.994
He's on his feet right now.

709
00:28:01.996 --> 00:28:05.235
There's the combination.
Ali has his man in trouble.

710
00:28:06.539 --> 00:28:09.308
[all] Oh!

711
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:11.716
I knew it was too good
to be true.

712
00:28:15.891 --> 00:28:18.027
Come on, baby.
Get up. Get up. You got it.

713
00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:20.365
[commentator] Wepner attempting
to hang on viciously.

714
00:28:20.367 --> 00:28:22.369
Wepner is out on his feet.

715
00:28:22.371 --> 00:28:24.039
A right hand off a left hook.

716
00:28:24.041 --> 00:28:26.544
Chuck Wepner, the count is up.

717
00:28:26.546 --> 00:28:28.448
<i>Four, five, six...</i>

718
00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:30.653
- Ah, get up! Get up!
- <i>...seven, eight.</i>

719
00:28:30.655 --> 00:28:32.356
<i>The referee stops the fight.</i>

720
00:28:32.358 --> 00:28:34.394
<i>It will be scored
as a technical knockout.</i>

721
00:28:34.396 --> 00:28:37.502
Muhammad Ali retains
the heavyweight championship.

722
00:28:42.879 --> 00:28:44.581
[Chuck] <i>In that moment
right there,</i>

723
00:28:44.583 --> 00:28:47.420
<i>I knew that fight with Ali
didn't end up in a loss.</i>

724
00:28:47.422 --> 00:28:50.560
<i>See, people from all over knew
that a nobody from Bayonne</i>

725
00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:52.096
<i>went the distance with the champ</i>

726
00:28:52.098 --> 00:28:53.969
<i>and that meant more to me
than anything.</i>

727
00:29:23.863 --> 00:29:26.934
<i>I'd gone 15 rounds with
the champion of the world.</i>

728
00:29:26.936 --> 00:29:29.006
<i>I wasn't a nobody now.</i>

729
00:29:29.008 --> 00:29:30.543
<i>I was a somebody.</i>

730
00:29:45.675 --> 00:29:47.712
Should I go to his room
or is he coming here?

731
00:29:48.914 --> 00:29:50.084
Very funny.

732
00:29:52.288 --> 00:29:53.892
You fought your ass off.

733
00:29:55.261 --> 00:29:56.730
You really did.

734
00:30:01.574 --> 00:30:02.743
[sniffs]

735
00:30:04.981 --> 00:30:06.884
[Chuck] It looks great on you,
by the way.

736
00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.623
Who cares?

737
00:30:12.196 --> 00:30:14.098
So you're gonna be a movie star?

738
00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.268
[laughs]
A movie star?

739
00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:18.106
He's too ugly
to be a movie star.

740
00:30:18.108 --> 00:30:19.174
Very funny, Donnie.

741
00:30:19.176 --> 00:30:20.110
It was kind of funny.

742
00:30:20.112 --> 00:30:22.280
No, no, no.
Leave, leave Chuckie alone.

743
00:30:22.282 --> 00:30:24.051
Chuckie, tell me
what it's all about.

744
00:30:24.053 --> 00:30:25.621
What's it all about? You?

745
00:30:25.623 --> 00:30:26.690
Well, you know, they say

746
00:30:26.692 --> 00:30:27.925
it's based on my fight with Ali,

747
00:30:27.927 --> 00:30:29.128
but, you know, it's not me.

748
00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:30.698
Some, some actor's
playing the role.

749
00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:32.234
Yeah, but it's some star
nobody knows.

750
00:30:32.236 --> 00:30:34.373
Some "Stallone-y"
or something like that

751
00:30:34.375 --> 00:30:35.908
- that's playing the role.
- Ah.

752
00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:38.315
"Stallone-y?"
"Stallone-y" baloney.

753
00:30:39.919 --> 00:30:41.354
[Chuck] <i>Fighting Ali was nothing</i>

754
00:30:41.356 --> 00:30:43.324
<i>compared to what was
coming my way.</i>

755
00:30:43.326 --> 00:30:44.827
<i>One night, I get this call</i>

756
00:30:44.829 --> 00:30:46.731
<i>from some movie producer
in Hollywood.</i>

757
00:30:46.733 --> 00:30:48.668
<i>He starts telling me
that they just made a movie</i>

758
00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:51.808
<i>about a boxer who I was
the inspiration for.</i>

759
00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:54.947
<i>It was a small movie
with an unknown actor in it.</i>

760
00:30:54.949 --> 00:30:56.284
<i>I didn't really care.</i>

761
00:30:56.286 --> 00:30:58.688
<i>I was just flattered
that they even called.</i>

762
00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:02.062
<i>But it turned out that movie
wasn't so small after all.</i>

763
00:31:02.064 --> 00:31:04.100
<i>In case you don't know
what I'm talking about,</i>

764
00:31:04.102 --> 00:31:06.204
<i>I'm talking about Rocky.</i>

765
00:31:06.206 --> 00:31:09.078
<i>It was amazing.
The movie was great.</i>

766
00:31:10.381 --> 00:31:11.515
I did.

767
00:31:11.517 --> 00:31:13.819
Who could've thought my story
would be so interesting?

768
00:31:13.821 --> 00:31:14.857
I know.

769
00:31:16.259 --> 00:31:17.328
[Phyllis] Of course it is.

770
00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:18.295
[Chuck] Hey, yo, Rocky.

771
00:31:18.297 --> 00:31:20.434
[Sylvester] Yo, yo, Chuckie,
how you doing?

772
00:31:20.436 --> 00:31:21.902
- Look who it is, man.
- [Chuck] Doing good.

773
00:31:21.904 --> 00:31:23.205
[Sylvester] The real Rocky.
Here he is.

774
00:31:23.207 --> 00:31:24.442
[Chuck]
This is my wife, Phyllis.

775
00:31:24.444 --> 00:31:25.511
- Hey, Phyllis, nice to meet you.
- [Phyllis] Nice to meet you.

776
00:31:25.513 --> 00:31:26.678
[Sylvester] Chuck, good,
thank you for coming out.

777
00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.217
- I appreciate it very much.
- Thank you for having me.

778
00:31:29.219 --> 00:31:30.487
Well, you know what, you know,

779
00:31:30.489 --> 00:31:32.090
Chuck is the inspiration
for this.

780
00:31:32.092 --> 00:31:33.159
Oh, thank you.

781
00:31:33.161 --> 00:31:34.227
Oh, Chuck, it's the truth.

782
00:31:34.229 --> 00:31:35.163
You know, I want
to say something.

783
00:31:35.165 --> 00:31:37.434
You know, watching
you fight Ali, you know,

784
00:31:37.436 --> 00:31:39.839
I always had <i>Rocky in mind</i>
but watching you fight

785
00:31:39.841 --> 00:31:41.876
just gave me that little,
you know, push.

786
00:31:41.878 --> 00:31:43.012
[all chuckle]

787
00:31:43.014 --> 00:31:44.882
Well, uh,
whatever I could do to help.

788
00:31:44.884 --> 00:31:45.918
Are you kidding me?
Thanks, Chuck.

789
00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.020
- Thanks for coming.
- Thank you for having us.

790
00:31:47.022 --> 00:31:48.790
- It was a pleasure meeting you.
- Thanks for coming.

791
00:31:48.792 --> 00:31:51.296
Hey, you guys
have a good night, okay?

792
00:31:51.298 --> 00:31:53.033
Let's go to Peter Luger's.

793
00:31:53.035 --> 00:31:54.168
- Really?
- Yeah, why not?

794
00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:56.072
- Do we have time?
- Yeah, we got time.

795
00:31:56.074 --> 00:31:57.107
Okay.

796
00:31:57.109 --> 00:32:00.080
I couldn't believe
how packed the theater was.

797
00:32:00.082 --> 00:32:02.786
Yeah, he's got
a pretty good movie, huh?

798
00:32:02.788 --> 00:32:04.923
Yeah, he does because of you.

799
00:32:04.925 --> 00:32:07.929
[announcer]
<i>And the winner is Rocky.</i>

800
00:32:07.931 --> 00:32:10.000
[cheers]

801
00:32:10.002 --> 00:32:12.138
[Chuck] <i>In true fashion
like a great fighter,</i>

802
00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:13.942
Rocky <i>knocked out</i>
<i>the competition</i>

803
00:32:13.944 --> 00:32:15.412
<i>and took home Best Picture.</i>

804
00:32:15.414 --> 00:32:18.217
<i>In the end, it won three Oscars.</i>

805
00:32:18.219 --> 00:32:19.587
[Artie]
No, it won't happen again.

806
00:32:19.589 --> 00:32:21.257
I have a fucking policy

807
00:32:21.259 --> 00:32:24.029
where people that are
fucking consistently late

808
00:32:24.031 --> 00:32:25.533
get fucking fired.

809
00:32:25.535 --> 00:32:26.469
You're fired.

810
00:32:26.471 --> 00:32:28.839
Get your shit
and get the fuck out now.

811
00:32:28.841 --> 00:32:31.547
Get out of my fucking club now!

812
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:33.849
Hey, John.

813
00:32:33.851 --> 00:32:35.252
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hey!

814
00:32:35.254 --> 00:32:36.455

824

Well, we got booze.

<i>So what did I do?</i>

Oh, yeah.

You're a fighter.

more money!

00:34:31.859 --> 00:34:35.264
He got Muhammad Ali
down on the canvas!

851
00:34:35.266 --> 00:34:39.205
And if it wasn't for the referee
counting so goddamn slow

852
00:34:39.207 --> 00:34:42.713
on purpose, he would've been
the champion of the world!

853
00:34:42.715 --> 00:34:44.450
And, to me, he definitely is.

854
00:34:44.452 --> 00:34:46.119
I know who you are.

855
00:34:46.121 --> 00:34:48.360
You're the guy
who knocked out Ali.

856
00:34:53.771 --> 00:34:55.706
Where's your brother?

857
00:34:55.708 --> 00:34:57.476
How would I know
where my brother is?

858
00:34:57.478 --> 00:34:59.747
I'm, I'm sure he's training
or something.

859
00:34:59.749 --> 00:35:01.618
Ain't it kind of late
to be training?

860
00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.522
He could be anywhere.
He's out there.

861
00:35:03.524 --> 00:35:04.758
I told you I'd go look for him.

862
00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.193
So 'cause he's popular
right now,

863
00:35:06.195 --> 00:35:07.262
I don't get to know where he is?

864
00:35:07.264 --> 00:35:08.400
Where the fuck is my husband?

865
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.212
I ain't fucking around anymore.

866
00:35:15.214 --> 00:35:17.316
If you don't tell me right now,
both of you guys

867
00:35:17.318 --> 00:35:18.386
get the fuck out of my house.

868
00:35:18.388 --> 00:35:20.657
Why don't you take this shit up
with your husband

869
00:35:20.659 --> 00:35:23.295
and leave me the fuck alone,
all right?

870
00:35:23.297 --> 00:35:26.267
You guys are both
fucking bullshit.

871
00:35:26.269 --> 00:35:28.473
- [Phyllis] Tsk, unreal.
- Fucking problem

872
00:35:28.475 --> 00:35:30.275
'cause you stick your nose
into every fucking problem,

873
00:35:30.277 --> 00:35:32.749
and you created
this fucking crazy bitch.

874
00:35:32.751 --> 00:35:34.686
What the... What's your problem?

875
00:35:34.688 --> 00:35:35.955
You want to blame me?

876
00:35:35.957 --> 00:35:37.761
Blame your fucking brother.

877
00:35:38.896 --> 00:35:41.566
Fuck this shit. Aye, fucking A.

878
00:35:41.568 --> 00:35:42.704
[clinks]

879
00:35:44.508 --> 00:35:48.815
You gotta slow down
with the chasing the skirts.

880
00:35:48.817 --> 00:35:50.652
Come on, Donnie, don't go
and Quaker on me,

881
00:35:50.654 --> 00:35:51.788
you fucking square.

882
00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:53.992
The fuck are you talking about?

883
00:35:53.994 --> 00:35:56.731
You, you didn't have to deal
with her shit

884
00:35:56.733 --> 00:35:58.637
and my girl's shit last night.
I did.

885
00:36:00.407 --> 00:36:01.974
Well, that's your problem
right there, Donnie.

886
00:36:01.976 --> 00:36:02.976
Your girl's got your impact.

887
00:36:02.978 --> 00:36:07.453
I ain't got problems, bro.
You got problems.

888
00:36:07.455 --> 00:36:09.623
[Donnie] I want you
to be fucking serious

889
00:36:09.625 --> 00:36:11.797
for one time
in your whole fucking life.

890
00:36:14.335 --> 00:36:15.737
Do me a favor.

891
00:36:15.739 --> 00:36:18.578
Just be a little more
fucking discreet, will you?

892
00:36:21.316 --> 00:36:22.484
- [Charlene] <i>Here.</i>
- [Phyllis] <i>Thank you.</i>

893
00:36:22.486 --> 00:36:25.023
All right, what about number 26?

894
00:36:25.859 --> 00:36:27.261
Uh...

895
00:36:28.464 --> 00:36:30.901
- Theodore Roosevelt.
- Yes.

896
00:36:30.903 --> 00:36:33.572
I think you're gonna ace
this one.

897
00:36:33.574 --> 00:36:35.277
What do you guys want to drink?

898
00:36:37.717 --> 00:36:39.921
[telephone rings]

899
00:36:42.125 --> 00:36:43.493
Hello?

900
00:36:43.495 --> 00:36:44.729
[Chuck] <i>Hey, baby.</i>

901
00:36:44.731 --> 00:36:46.000
Do you know what time it is?

902
00:36:46.902 --> 00:36:48.939
Sorry. I know it's late.

903
00:36:49.874 --> 00:36:51.476
I won tonight, though.

904
00:36:51.478 --> 00:36:53.113
Where are you?

905
00:36:53.115 --> 00:36:54.782
[Chuck] <i>Uh, a hotel
in North Bergen.</i>

906
00:36:54.784 --> 00:36:56.753
I didn't want to drive home.
I wasn't feeling so good.

907
00:36:56.755 --> 00:36:58.156
Well, then you should be home,
Chuck.

908
00:36:58.158 --> 00:36:59.494
[sniffs]

909
00:37:00.864 --> 00:37:02.333
I'm pretty tired.

910
00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:04.738
Good night, honey.

911
00:37:07.444 --> 00:37:10.748
[Chuck] <i>I was in a constant
rotation of fighting, fucking,</i>

912
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:12.152
<i>and doing blow.</i>

913
00:37:12.154 --> 00:37:14.425
<i>Life after Rocky
was like an endless night out.</i>

914
00:37:14.959 --> 00:37:16.062
[moans]

915
00:37:36.068 --> 00:37:37.570
[groans]

916
00:37:37.572 --> 00:37:38.874
Thank you, baby.

917
00:37:40.511 --> 00:37:43.015
Nah, it's just I always
get shit at home.

918
00:37:43.017 --> 00:37:44.550
Everyone's always busting
my balls.

919
00:37:44.552 --> 00:37:47.556
My brother. Phyllis.

920
00:37:47.558 --> 00:37:49.795
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I love my kids, but...

921
00:37:49.797 --> 00:37:53.001
I don't want to break
your balls, Chuckie.

922
00:37:53.003 --> 00:37:56.176
I just want to do drugs
and fuck you all night long.

923
00:37:57.913 --> 00:38:00.015
Well, cheers to the groupies.

924
00:38:00.017 --> 00:38:01.752
Boxers don't have groupies.

925
00:38:01.754 --> 00:38:03.690
Rock stars have groupies.

926
00:38:03.692 --> 00:38:05.861
You ain't no fucking rock star.

927
00:38:05.863 --> 00:38:07.664
I'll fuck you
like you're Jimmy Page,

928
00:38:07.666 --> 00:38:08.903
but you ain't Jimmy Page.

929
00:38:09.603 --> 00:38:11.305
[laughs]

930
00:38:11.307 --> 00:38:13.142
[Chuck] <i>It was a crazy ride.</i>

931
00:38:13.144 --> 00:38:15.614
<i>But like all good things,
it had to come to an end.</i>

932
00:38:15.616 --> 00:38:16.950
[Phyllis] <i>Where have you been?</i>

933
00:38:16.952 --> 00:38:18.186
[clanks]

934
00:38:18.188 --> 00:38:19.556
[Chuck] Out.

935
00:38:19.558 --> 00:38:21.259
Where'd you get that shirt?

936
00:38:21.261 --> 00:38:22.628
I bought it at a store.

937
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:23.530
I've never seen
that shirt before.

938
00:38:23.532 --> 00:38:25.503
[Phyllis]
Where you've been shopping?

939
00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.209
When did you go shopping?

940
00:38:29.211 --> 00:38:30.946
I don't know,
I went the other day.

941
00:38:30.948 --> 00:38:32.048
I bought some clothes.

942
00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:33.885
The other day? You...
Oh, when you were training?

943
00:38:33.887 --> 00:38:35.922
You're fucking drunk.
Give me that.

944
00:38:35.924 --> 00:38:38.795
[Phyllis] You don't need
to be drinking anymore.

945
00:38:38.797 --> 00:38:40.899
What, now you get to tell me
what I can drink and not drink?

946
00:38:40.901 --> 00:38:42.836
- That's what...
- I've never told you what to do.

947
00:38:42.838 --> 00:38:45.776
'Cause now, 'cause now
you're stuck with a fucking ball

948
00:38:45.778 --> 00:38:47.347
and motherfucking chain

949
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:49.050
that's gonna make
your motherfucking life

950
00:38:49.052 --> 00:38:50.318
a living motherfucking hell.

951
00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.522
You know what,
you need to shut the fuck up

952
00:38:51.524 --> 00:38:53.191
- and we need to go sleep.
- No, I won't shut the fuck up.

953
00:38:53.193 --> 00:38:54.260
We can talk about this tomorrow.

954
00:38:54.262 --> 00:38:55.730
- You go to sleep.
- You're fucking all riled up.

955
00:38:55.732 --> 00:38:57.734
You're fucking insane right now.

956
00:38:57.736 --> 00:38:58.938
[Chuck]
You've never been correct.

957
00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:02.042
Then why'd you marry me?

958
00:39:02.044 --> 00:39:03.746
[Phyllis] I was young?

959
00:39:03.748 --> 00:39:05.783
You were beautiful.
You were nice to me.

960
00:39:05.785 --> 00:39:07.354
You think you're nice to me now?
Are you nice to me?

961
00:39:07.356 --> 00:39:09.023
Is this nice?
Coming home to this?

962
00:39:09.025 --> 00:39:10.293
I mean, it would be nice
to come home

963
00:39:10.295 --> 00:39:12.263
and maybe, get,
like, a fucking hug.

964
00:39:12.265 --> 00:39:13.199
You know, maybe give me...

965
00:39:13.201 --> 00:39:15.002
give me a fucking kiss
when I come home.

966
00:39:15.004 --> 00:39:16.439
I did like you,
but you smell like shit.

967
00:39:16.441 --> 00:39:18.044
'Cause I was
at a fucking nightclub!

968
00:39:18.912 --> 00:39:20.012
You came home to what?

969
00:39:20.014 --> 00:39:21.416
Me sitting there waiting
for you?

970
00:39:21.418 --> 00:39:24.221
Can we go to sleep and talk
about this in the morning?

971
00:39:24.223 --> 00:39:25.893
[Chuck] What the fuck, Phyllis?

972
00:39:26.828 --> 00:39:28.028
You're fucking poison.

973
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:29.765
You fucking piece of shit!

974
00:39:29.767 --> 00:39:31.135
- Close the fucking door!
- Kids, come on down!

975
00:39:31.137 --> 00:39:32.439
[Chuck] Shut the fuck up.

976
00:39:32.441 --> 00:39:34.977
Shut the fuck up
and stop fucking waking them up!

977
00:39:34.979 --> 00:39:38.083
Shut the fuck up
and stop waking up our kids.

978
00:39:38.085 --> 00:39:39.285
You're going crazy in the middle
of the fucking night.

979
00:39:39.287 --> 00:39:41.457
I'm not going crazy.
I'm very calm.

980
00:39:41.459 --> 00:39:44.496
So fucking what if
I fucking broke things?

981
00:39:44.498 --> 00:39:46.467
- I'm fucking pissed...
- Shut the fuck up!

982
00:39:46.469 --> 00:39:48.036
- Yeah?
- Shut the fuck up!

983
00:39:48.038 --> 00:39:49.038
- Yeah, fucking tell me!
- Shut the fuck up!

984
00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.242
You want to pack a bag?
Then fucking pack a bag!

985
00:39:51.244 --> 00:39:52.979
They're already all packed up,
up there!

986
00:39:52.981 --> 00:39:54.386
- They're all waiting.
- Shut the fuck up.

987
00:39:56.155 --> 00:39:57.856
- Fuck...
- Fucking...

988
00:39:57.858 --> 00:39:59.159
Do it.

989
00:39:59.161 --> 00:40:01.230
- Do it. Do it.
- Fuck you.

990
00:40:01.232 --> 00:40:03.769
- Chuck Wepner fucking knocked...
- Fuck you.

991
00:40:03.771 --> 00:40:04.938
Fuck you.

992
00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.376
You know, maybe you could
wear that for me

993
00:40:07.378 --> 00:40:08.277
every once in awhile.

994
00:40:08.279 --> 00:40:09.914
You know, in fact,
maybe if I came home

995
00:40:09.916 --> 00:40:11.016
and you were wearing that

996
00:40:11.018 --> 00:40:12.389
instead of fucking screaming
at me.

997
00:40:15.429 --> 00:40:16.861
Sure.

998
00:40:16.863 --> 00:40:19.200
- I'll put this on for you.
- Put it on for me.

999
00:40:19.202 --> 00:40:20.302
And now what?

1000
00:40:20.304 --> 00:40:22.574
I'm gonna still
motherfucking walk away.

1001
00:40:22.576 --> 00:40:24.310
- You want to walk away from me?
- I don't give a fuck about you

1002
00:40:24.312 --> 00:40:29.256
and your fucking stupid
assnasty blue fucking...

1003
00:40:30.191 --> 00:40:31.593
Sweetie, please.

1004
00:40:31.595 --> 00:40:32.961
- Sweetie.
- Can we just lie down?

1005
00:40:32.963 --> 00:40:34.063
- Sweetie.
- You look so beautiful.

1006
00:40:34.065 --> 00:40:35.132
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

1007
00:40:35.134 --> 00:40:36.201
Come on.

1008
00:40:36.203 --> 00:40:37.873
Did we get off
on the wrong foot?

1009
00:40:48.061 --> 00:40:50.331
I'm sorry. I love you so much.

1010
00:40:50.333 --> 00:40:51.935
I love you so much, Chuck.

1011
00:40:54.073 --> 00:40:56.175
I'm sorry if I fucked this up.

1012
00:40:56.177 --> 00:40:57.947
You broke my fucking heart.

1013
00:40:58.983 --> 00:41:01.152
My fucking heart is shattered.

1014
00:41:01.154 --> 00:41:02.290
You ruined me.

1015
00:41:03.493 --> 00:41:05.196
You ruined our marriage.

1016
00:41:06.599 --> 00:41:08.403
But you won't ruin my life.

1017
00:41:09.906 --> 00:41:11.374
You ruined your own life.

1018
00:41:11.376 --> 00:41:12.912
I'm going to sleep.

1019
00:41:14.949 --> 00:41:17.153
I am so disappointed in you.

1020
00:41:28.611 --> 00:41:29.944
Okay.

1021
00:41:29.946 --> 00:41:32.584
[Chuck]
<i>This hurt more than any jab.</i>

1022
00:41:32.586 --> 00:41:36.625
<i>I'd rather let Ali beat the shit
out of me for another 15 rounds</i>

1023
00:41:36.627 --> 00:41:39.063
<i>than have to see the looks
on my kids' faces</i>

1024
00:41:39.065 --> 00:41:41.569
<i>as their mother packed
their bags.</i>

1025
00:41:41.571 --> 00:41:44.039
[Phyllis] All right, kids,
come on, let's go.

1026
00:41:44.041 --> 00:41:45.446
I'll walk you to the car.

1027
00:41:47.281 --> 00:41:49.085
- Bye, Daddy.
- [Phyllis sighs]

1028
00:41:53.294 --> 00:41:54.729
All right, Ron, be careful.

1029
00:41:54.731 --> 00:41:55.998
Bags and everything, okay?

1030
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.169
- Phyllis.
- What?

1031
00:41:58.171 --> 00:41:59.304
[Chuck] Phyllis, you don't have
to do this.

1032
00:41:59.306 --> 00:42:00.306
You did this!

1033
00:42:00.308 --> 00:42:02.611
You don't care.
I don't care. You don't care.

1034
00:42:02.613 --> 00:42:04.082
It doesn't matter.

1035
00:42:04.785 --> 00:42:06.554
[car engine revs]

1036
00:42:06.556 --> 00:42:07.957
Phyllis.

1037
00:42:08.493 --> 00:42:10.397
Phyllis, please.

1038
00:42:29.133 --> 00:42:30.703
Don't worry, bro.

1039
00:42:30.705 --> 00:42:32.106
She'll be back.

1040
00:42:32.775 --> 00:42:34.210
I don't think so.

1041
00:42:37.519 --> 00:42:39.587
[Donnie] You know
what your problem is?

1042
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:40.791
You're too hardheaded.

1043
00:42:42.227 --> 00:42:44.531
It's exactly why she left you.

1044
00:42:44.533 --> 00:42:49.239
You don't fucking listen
and you never have self-control.

1045
00:42:49.241 --> 00:42:50.378
Never.

1046
00:42:53.216 --> 00:42:54.487
Do me a favor, Don.

1047
00:42:55.656 --> 00:42:57.090
Anything for you, bro.

1048
00:42:58.562 --> 00:43:00.465
- Shut the fuck up, will you?
- [Donnie chuckles]

1049
00:43:02.636 --> 00:43:04.505
[Chuck]
<i>I need to get back to work.</i>

1050
00:43:04.507 --> 00:43:05.907
<i>I need to get my mind off</i>

1051
00:43:05.909 --> 00:43:08.780
<i>those taillights driving away
from the house.</i>

1052
00:43:08.782 --> 00:43:12.454
<i>The only thing that could get
my mind right was a match.</i>

1053
00:43:12.456 --> 00:43:14.527
<i>To hear those crowds again.</i>

1054
00:43:18.636 --> 00:43:20.235
[crowd cheer]

1055
00:43:20.237 --> 00:43:21.740
<i>So how do you follow up a fight</i>

1056
00:43:21.742 --> 00:43:23.944
<i>against the most famous boxer
who ever lived?</i>

1057
00:43:23.946 --> 00:43:26.350
Holy shit.

1058
00:43:26.352 --> 00:43:30.256
Well, yeah, the guy's big,
but he's slow as shit.

1059
00:43:30.258 --> 00:43:32.260
[Chuck] <i>If you're me,
you fight the largest wrestler</i>

1060
00:43:32.262 --> 00:43:34.499
<i>in the world at Shea Stadium.</i>

1061
00:43:34.501 --> 00:43:37.472
He body slams you,
we get the money and we go home.

1062
00:43:37.474 --> 00:43:39.143
Then it's back to real fighting.

1063
00:43:40.481 --> 00:43:41.346
There's no way in hell

1064
00:43:41.348 --> 00:43:43.852
I'm letting that fat fuck body
slam me.

1065
00:43:43.854 --> 00:43:45.689
He can throw me
through the ropes

1066
00:43:45.691 --> 00:43:46.891
or something, but that's it.

1067
00:43:46.893 --> 00:43:48.260
I'll talk to Vince.

1068
00:43:48.262 --> 00:43:49.229
No, you don't talk to him.

1069
00:43:49.231 --> 00:43:50.766
You tell him
that's how it's gonna be, Al.

1070
00:43:50.768 --> 00:43:53.973
All right, already.
Take it easy, Chuck.

1071
00:43:53.975 --> 00:43:55.776
[commentator] <i>Now, look at
the difference in their size.</i>

1072
00:43:55.778 --> 00:43:57.513
Wepner is a big man,

1073
00:43:57.515 --> 00:43:59.617
a big man by any stretch
of the imagination.

1074
00:43:59.619 --> 00:44:01.855
232 pounds, I believe.

1075
00:44:01.857 --> 00:44:04.026
But a midget compared
to Andre the Giant.

1076
00:44:04.028 --> 00:44:06.296
Andre's not gonna be able
to move in the ring

1077
00:44:06.298 --> 00:44:07.369
against Chuck Wepner.

1078
00:44:08.504 --> 00:44:10.005
Pounding away to the kidney now.

1079
00:44:10.007 --> 00:44:12.944
Andre has him, but doesn't know
what to do with him.

1080
00:44:12.946 --> 00:44:15.485
The ref should get in there
and break it up by all rights.

1081
00:44:16.286 --> 00:44:17.556
Oh, baby!

1082
00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:24.869
[Chuck] <i>See, you don't know
the true meaning of rock-bottom</i>

1083
00:44:24.871 --> 00:44:26.304
<i>till an overweight,</i>

1084
00:44:26.306 --> 00:44:27.508
<i>enormous European guy

1085
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:29.912
<i>like a baby
and throws you around.</i>

1086
00:44:29.914 --> 00:44:32.852
<i>I was broke with no family
and getting tossed around</i>

1087
00:44:32.854 --> 00:44:34.689
<i>like a piece of trash.</i>

1088
00:44:34.691 --> 00:44:36.760
Got any more of this, baby?

1089
00:44:36.762 --> 00:44:38.396
Nah, that's it...

1090
00:44:38.398 --> 00:44:40.067
[Chuck] <i>I couldn't help feeling
like I deserved it.</i>

1091
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:42.371
No more party favors,
no more party.

1092
00:44:42.373 --> 00:44:43.841
[Chuck] <i>I was just about ready
to tap out.</i>

1093
00:44:43.843 --> 00:44:45.344
Give me a Scotch and soda.

1094
00:44:45.346 --> 00:44:46.647
You're cut off.

1095
00:44:46.649 --> 00:44:47.682
You're cut off.

1096
00:44:47.684 --> 00:44:49.720
Just give me, like,
a soda with Scotch, then.

1097
00:44:49.722 --> 00:44:51.624
[Chuck]
<i>Then she walked into my life.</i>

1098
00:44:51.626 --> 00:44:52.692
Come on.

1099
00:44:52.694 --> 00:44:54.331
I'll take two waters.

1100
00:44:56.369 --> 00:44:58.571
Take it easy, slugger.

1101
00:44:58.573 --> 00:45:00.744
You get kicked out of here,
you don't get back in.

1102
00:45:04.886 --> 00:45:05.922
I'm Chuck.

1103
00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:08.892
I know who you are.

1104
00:45:08.894 --> 00:45:10.698
- I'm Linda.
- [glasses clink]

1105
00:45:11.532 --> 00:45:12.834
[Chuck] <i>Linda.</i>

1106

<i>I swear,
she was sent from heaven.</i>

1107
00:45:16.476 --> 00:45:19.649
<i>That woman came into my life
just when I needed her most.</i>

1108
00:45:21.085 --> 00:45:22.553
You know, I think
we're going to be friends

1109
00:45:22.555 --> 00:45:23.789
for a long time, Linda.

1110
00:45:23.791 --> 00:45:26.795
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah.

1111
00:45:26.797 --> 00:45:29.000
- Cheers to friends.
- Cheers to friends.

1112
00:45:29.002 --> 00:45:31.104
- Do you like steak?
- I love steak.

1113
00:45:31.106 --> 00:45:33.743
Yeah, it's pretty tasty.
With, like, béarnaise sauce.

1114
00:45:33.745 --> 00:45:36.214
I don't know, I just like salt
on it and stuff like that.

1115
00:45:36.216 --> 00:45:37.484
You only like salt.

1116
00:45:37.486 --> 00:45:39.155
- This is me.
- Oh, is it?

1117
00:45:40.792 --> 00:45:44.097
Well, I, uh, I had a great time.
I really needed this.

1118
00:45:44.099 --> 00:45:45.135
Me, too.

1119
00:45:46.036 --> 00:45:48.539
[chuckles]

1120
00:45:48.541 --> 00:45:50.710
- Good night, Linda.
- All right, good night.

1121
00:45:50.712 --> 00:45:51.814
Okay.

<i>They never left the top.</i>

00:46:10.086 --> 00:46:11.853
[Sage] When will you make
another movie?

1127
00:46:11.855 --> 00:46:14.292
When am I making another movie?
I'm making one right now.

1128
00:46:14.294 --> 00:46:16.831
I'm making <i>Rocky II.</i>
What, you wanna be in it, huh?

1129
00:46:16.833 --> 00:46:17.967
- You want to be in it?
- Yes.

1130
00:46:17.969 --> 00:46:20.039
You want to be in it?
All right, I'll put you in it.

1131
00:46:21.141 --> 00:46:22.676
I want to be Rocky
when I grow up.

1132
00:46:22.678 --> 00:46:23.945
Wait a minute. Wait, hey.

1133
00:46:23.947 --> 00:46:25.214
You want to be Rocky?
What about me?

1134
00:46:25.216 --> 00:46:26.418
What about your dad?

1135
00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:28.755
Okay, you want to be Rocky?
Okay, you got it, all right?

1136

Listen, do me a favor.

1137
00:46:29.993 --> 00:46:31.126
Daddy gotta make a phone call.

1138
00:46:31.128 --> 00:46:32.262
Just be quiet
for a couple of minutes

1139
00:46:32.264 --> 00:46:33.665
- and we'll play, okay?
- Okay.

1140
00:46:33.667 --> 00:46:35.104
All right, play with your horse.

Congrats on all the success.

Hey, man, thanks a lot, Chuck.
I appreciate it.

1148

Look, Chuck, you know,

1149
00:46:55.278 --> 00:46:57.914
I got this role in mind for you
in <i>Rocky II, okay?</i>

1150
00:46:57.916 --> 00:46:59.217
It's this experienced fighter.

1151

His name is Chink Weber and,
you know, he spars with <i>Rocky.</i>

1152
00:47:03.395 --> 00:47:04.661
Chink Weber?

1153
00:47:04.663 --> 00:47:05.630
It sounds a lot like my name.

1154
00:47:05.632 --> 00:47:07.334
Yeah, yeah,
it's kind of the point, Chuck.

1155
00:47:07.336 --> 00:47:08.336
It was written for you.

1156
00:47:08.338 --> 00:47:11.208
Look, all you gotta do
is come in, audition,

1157
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:13.079
and the part's yours, okay?

1158
00:47:13.081 --> 00:47:15.016
- Seriously?
- <i>Yeah, come on, Chuck.</i>

1159
00:47:15.018 --> 00:47:17.355
You belong in <i>Rocky II.</i>
I wrote this for you.

1160
00:47:17.357 --> 00:47:19.258
- I'll be there.
- <i>My secretary will...</i>

- Fucking, yeah.
- Can I come?

Yeah, you can all come
to fucking Hollywood.

1175
00:47:46.182 --> 00:47:47.716
I'll open up a fucking club
out there.

Hey, Chuck, before we go,
let's get breakfast.

- Afternoon.
- What time is it?

1179

I got a fucking watch.

What's up?

I think that train you're
supposed to catch at 7:45?

Yeah?

Oh, shit.

1186

Your boy's late, Sly.

1187
00:48:13.371 --> 00:48:14.407
Yeah, I know.

1188
00:48:15.274 --> 00:48:16.377
So who's next?

1189
00:48:17.413 --> 00:48:19.549
[knocking]

1190
00:48:19.551 --> 00:48:20.852
Roy, get that.

1191
00:48:27.866 --> 00:48:29.369
- Hey.
- Stallone.

1192
00:48:29.371 --> 00:48:31.072
- Hey.
- You're late.

1193
00:48:31.074 --> 00:48:34.180
Look, we don't do
late here, Chuck.

1194
00:48:35.817 --> 00:48:37.385
Yeah, hey, Chuck. Listen.

1195
00:48:37.387 --> 00:48:39.321
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hey.

1196
00:48:39.323 --> 00:48:41.526
- You feeling okay?
- Yeah, yeah, it's good.

1197
00:48:41.528 --> 00:48:42.529
I just had a crazy night.

1198
00:48:42.531 --> 00:48:44.433
Yeah, I know,
it happens to the best of us.

1199
00:48:44.435 --> 00:48:45.636
Listen, Chuck.

1200
00:48:45.638 --> 00:48:47.839
What we're gonna do is we're
just gonna have you read it

1201
00:48:47.841 --> 00:48:48.941
from the script a little bit

1202
00:48:48.943 --> 00:48:50.612
before we offer you the role,
okay?

1203
00:48:50.614 --> 00:48:52.148
- All right, sounds good.
- All right, good.

1204
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:55.888
So listen, why don't you, um,
turn to page five,

1205
00:48:55.890 --> 00:48:57.995
and, um, when you're ready.

1206
00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:00.999
Uh...

1207
00:49:01.001 --> 00:49:03.338
- really excited about this.
- Take a deep breath.

1208
00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:05.409
You can do this.
Come on. Here we go.

1209
00:49:05.411 --> 00:49:06.413
Uh...

1210
00:49:08.651 --> 00:49:10.553
Uh, Chink Weber says, um,

1211
00:49:10.555 --> 00:49:11.888
"You are fighting all over..."

1212
00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:13.023
Wait, wait, wait, Chuck, Chuck,

1213
00:49:13.025 --> 00:49:16.398
you, uh, you don't have
to read the character's name.

1214
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.001
You just...

1215
00:49:18.003 --> 00:49:19.338
Just read the lines.

1216
00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:20.406
- Oh, sorry.
- It's all right.

1217
00:49:20.408 --> 00:49:22.009
- That was my first time.
- First time, I understand.

1218
00:49:22.011 --> 00:49:23.514
It's all right.
Now, from the top.

1219
00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:26.152
All right, uh...

1220
00:49:28.458 --> 00:49:31.395
"You are fighting
all over the place, Rock."

1221
00:49:31.397 --> 00:49:32.465
"Yeah, I know, Chink."

1222
00:49:32.467 --> 00:49:34.337
"You know, I don't think
I'm ready for this fight."

1223
00:49:37.343 --> 00:49:39.945
"You gotta have some heat...
hea... heart."

1224
00:49:39.947 --> 00:49:42.985
- Sorry, sorry, man.
- Take your... Chuck.

1225
00:49:42.987 --> 00:49:45.022
[Sylvester] You looked
at these lines before, right?

1226
00:49:45.024 --> 00:49:46.125
Yeah, a little bit, yeah.

1227
00:49:46.127 --> 00:49:47.160
Well, you got nothing
to worry about.

1228
00:49:47.162 --> 00:49:49.097
Come on, man, Chuck,
I wrote this part for you.

1229
00:49:49.099 --> 00:49:51.201
You can do this.

1230
00:49:51.203 --> 00:49:52.440
- All right, sorry.
- Yeah.

1231
00:49:55.078 --> 00:49:56.111
"Come on, Rock.

1232
00:49:56.113 --> 00:49:59.151
You gotta have some
fucking heart out there."

1233
00:49:59.153 --> 00:50:01.121
Read the lines on the page,
please.

1234
00:50:01.123 --> 00:50:02.492
Hey, I can read, asshole.

1235
00:50:02.494 --> 00:50:04.498
- This guy.
- Asshole?

1236
00:50:06.034 --> 00:50:08.170
- Do you know who I am?
- Excuse me?

1237
00:50:08.172 --> 00:50:10.075
Do you know
who you're talking to?

1238
00:50:11.211 --> 00:50:12.649
The guy who gets
Stallone's coffee.

1239
00:50:14.184 --> 00:50:18.359
I produce motion pictures
for Sylvester Stallone.

1240
00:50:20.631 --> 00:50:21.765
[Arthur] You come in here

1241
00:50:21.767 --> 00:50:24.704
and you disrespect everything
we do in this business.

1242
00:50:24.706 --> 00:50:27.075
Get your act together,
read the lines,

1243
00:50:27.077 --> 00:50:28.612
and do me a fucking favor,
all right?

1244
00:50:28.614 --> 00:50:30.281
Don't come in here
fucking around

1245
00:50:30.283 --> 00:50:32.152
and read off the goddamn script!

1246
00:50:32.154 --> 00:50:33.221
I'm gonna knock
this guy's fucking teeth out.

1247
00:50:33.223 --> 00:50:34.256
Hey, hey, hey,
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.

1248
00:50:34.258 --> 00:50:36.394
This is that amateur hour
with this guy, Sly.

1249
00:50:36.396 --> 00:50:38.533
Arthur, one minute here.
Hold on, Chuck.

1250
00:50:38.535 --> 00:50:41.303
This isn't no bars
in Bayonne here.

1251
00:50:41.305 --> 00:50:42.774
Come on, man,
I gave you an opportunity

1252
00:50:42.776 --> 00:50:45.380
to come in here. This guy...
This is a Hollywood guy.

1253
00:50:45.382 --> 00:50:46.816
You gotta do this
in a different way.

1254
00:50:46.818 --> 00:50:49.488
It's a different animal.
Robert put him here for me.

1255
00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:52.293
You gotta make amends here.
Apologize to this guy.

1256
00:50:52.295 --> 00:50:53.463
I ain't apologizing
to this asshole.

1257
00:50:53.465 --> 00:50:55.299
Chuck, you gotta do me a favor.

1258
00:50:55.301 --> 00:50:56.435
You gotta apologize to him.

1259
00:50:56.437 --> 00:50:58.138
I gotta work with this guy.

1260
00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:02.113
- Sorry, sorry.
- No, not to me, to him.

1261
00:51:02.115 --> 00:51:03.686
I brought you down here.
Come on.

1262
00:51:05.590 --> 00:51:06.690
Sorry.

1263
00:51:06.692 --> 00:51:08.158
Okay?

1264
00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:09.431
Yeah, Chuck, lis... Listen.

1265
00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:12.602
I'll, I'll meet you...
Wait outside.

1266
00:51:12.604 --> 00:51:13.737
All right,
I'll be right outside.

1267
00:51:13.739 --> 00:51:15.841
We'll do it again, all right?

1268
00:51:15.843 --> 00:51:16.911
It's a good read, Chuck.

1269
00:51:16.913 --> 00:51:18.714
- You're a very good actor.
- Yeah.

1270
00:51:18.716 --> 00:51:20.085
- Very good.
- Thank you.

1271
00:51:26.164 --> 00:51:27.633
[door closes]

1272
00:51:27.635 --> 00:51:29.539
That was an embarrassment, Sly.

1273
00:51:31.676 --> 00:51:33.545
Arthur, I tried to give him
a shot, okay?

1274
00:51:33.547 --> 00:51:34.749
I tried to help him.

1275
00:51:37.421 --> 00:51:38.724
[telephone rings]

1276
00:51:42.465 --> 00:51:43.598
Hello?

1277
00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.502
[Julie] Hey, Chuck,
how's it going?

1278
00:51:45.504 --> 00:51:47.339
Fine, I guess. Uh, who is this?

1279
00:51:47.341 --> 00:51:49.309
I'm with <i>Rocky II.</i>

1280
00:51:49.311 --> 00:51:52.248
Hey, look, I'm sorry, Chuck,
they're cutting out your part.

1281
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:54.521
We're taking Chink Weber
out of the script.

1282
00:51:54.523 --> 00:51:56.525
I'm sorry, it's just the
audition didn't go well

1283
00:51:56.527 --> 00:51:59.498
and the part wasn't really
fitting with the script.

1284
00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:02.972
Hey, Arthur from the studio said
he would like to speak to you.

1285
00:52:02.974 --> 00:52:06.946
Chuck, we feel bad for you.
We really do.

1286
00:52:06.948 --> 00:52:09.418
In all walks of life,
you lose, my friend.

1287
00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:13.025
You come this close to the prize
and drop the ball every time.

1288
00:52:13.027 --> 00:52:15.564
Winners win and losers lose,
my friend.

1289
00:52:15.566 --> 00:52:17.668
So if you do want a job, though,

1290
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:19.872
you can always start
at the bottom, like I did,

1291
00:52:19.874 --> 00:52:21.976
<i>and maybe get Stallone
his coffee.</i>

1292
00:52:21.978 --> 00:52:23.814
Well, Chuck,
the usual as always,

1293
00:52:23.816 --> 00:52:25.218
go fuck yourself.

1294
00:52:28.759 --> 00:52:29.862
[shatters]

1295
00:52:31.031 --> 00:52:32.701
Oh, fuck!

1296
00:52:36.074 --> 00:52:38.043
[Chuck] <i>I already knew
this was coming</i>

1297
00:52:38.045 --> 00:52:39.747
<i>but just like a right cross
to the jaw,</i>

1298
00:52:39.749 --> 00:52:42.921
<i>you see it but it still hurts
when it lands.</i>

1299
00:52:57.685 --> 00:52:59.689
[sniffs]

1300
00:53:05.668 --> 00:53:08.006
[puffs]

1301
00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:21.033
[telephone ringing]

1302
00:53:22.570 --> 00:53:24.505
Hello?

1303
00:53:24.507 --> 00:53:25.943
It's, uh, it's Chuck.

1304
00:53:26.778 --> 00:53:28.548
Hey, Chuck, how are you?

1305
00:53:29.584 --> 00:53:31.117
It's kind of late, huh?

1306
00:53:31.119 --> 00:53:32.857
Yeah, sorry about that. I, um...

1307
00:53:34.193 --> 00:53:35.727
can't sleep.

1308
00:53:35.729 --> 00:53:36.729
Mm.

1309
00:53:36.731 --> 00:53:38.735
[Chuck] <i>I auditioned for</i>
Rocky II <i>today.</i>

1310
00:53:40.205 --> 00:53:41.138
Oh.

1311
00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:44.478
I didn't know
they were making a sequel.

1312
00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.817
Yeah, Stallone
wanted me in it but I, uh...

1313
00:53:46.819 --> 00:53:48.823
[exhales]

1314
00:53:49.725 --> 00:53:50.727
I blew it.

1315
00:53:52.196 --> 00:53:55.768
Yeah, well, take comfort
in knowing if it wasn't for you,

1316
00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:58.674
there wouldn't be a <i>Rocky.</i>

1317
00:53:58.676 --> 00:54:02.517
Hey, you want to, uh, you know,
go to dinner or something?

1318
00:54:03.486 --> 00:54:06.023
Yes, I would.

1319
00:54:06.025 --> 00:54:07.258
Now, go to bed, Chuck.

1320
00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:09.195
[Chuck] <i>All right,
goodbye, Linda.</i>

1321
00:54:09.197 --> 00:54:10.467
Bye.

1322
00:54:20.287 --> 00:54:23.995
- Whoo! Nice one.
- Yeah, see what I can do here.

1323
00:54:26.934 --> 00:54:28.970
Mm.

1324
00:54:28.972 --> 00:54:30.642
What's going on with <i>Rocky II?</i>

1325
00:54:34.717 --> 00:54:36.852
Stallone hasn't been
returning my calls.

1326
00:54:36.854 --> 00:54:39.023
Oh. I wouldn't worry.

1327
00:54:39.025 --> 00:54:40.927
I mean, those big
Hollywood actors

1328
00:54:40.929 --> 00:54:42.165
can get so busy.

1329
00:54:43.201 --> 00:54:44.703
How do you do that?

1330
00:54:45.138 --> 00:54:47.240
Do what?

1331
00:54:47.242 --> 00:54:49.578
Make me feel better about
everything that's going on.

1332
00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:50.781
[Linda] I don't know.

1333
00:54:50.783 --> 00:54:52.519
I just call it like I see it.

1334
00:54:57.830 --> 00:54:58.899
Ha.

1335
00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.343
Oh! Not that one.

1336
00:55:04.345 --> 00:55:05.611
Here's your check.

1337
00:55:05.613 --> 00:55:06.679
- [Linda] Oh, thank you.
- Oh, nice.

1338
00:55:06.681 --> 00:55:07.815
You're welcome.

1339
00:55:07.817 --> 00:55:09.719
[Linda] Let's split it.

1340
00:55:09.721 --> 00:55:11.322
[Chuck] No, no, I... I insist.

1341
00:55:11.324 --> 00:55:13.026
- Let me get it.
- No.

1342
00:55:13.028 --> 00:55:14.363
[Chuck] <i>I felt like a prick.</i>

1343
00:55:14.365 --> 00:55:16.166
<i>I fought the greatest boxer
of all time,</i>

1344
00:55:16.168 --> 00:55:18.638
<i>got one of the most
legendary films of all time</i>

1345
00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:22.813
<i>based off me, and I didn't have
a penny to show for it.</i>

1346
00:55:22.815 --> 00:55:24.585
Turns out I don't really have
any money, though.

1347
00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:27.123
I don't like you anymore.

1348
00:55:28.058 --> 00:55:30.027
Well, I still like you.

1349
00:55:30.029 --> 00:55:31.666
Well, I'll just be your friend.

1350
00:55:33.136 --> 00:55:34.638
What are you doing
with your life?

1351
00:55:35.441 --> 00:55:39.113
Bro, your wife left you.

1352
00:55:39.115 --> 00:55:41.852
You screwed up
the biggest fucking audition

1353
00:55:41.854 --> 00:55:44.125
of your life
with Sylvester Stallone.

1354
00:55:45.462 --> 00:55:47.231
What are you doing
with your life now?

1355
00:55:49.201 --> 00:55:50.903
What am I doing with my life?

1356
00:55:50.905 --> 00:55:53.108
Yeah, what are you doing
with your life, huh?

1357
00:55:53.110 --> 00:55:55.312
You're so special?

1358
00:55:55.314 --> 00:55:57.783
You're an ironworker
from New Jersey, Donnie.

1359
00:55:57.785 --> 00:56:00.322
All right, I'm Chuck Wepner.
People know me.

1360
00:56:00.324 --> 00:56:02.461
People respect me.

1361
00:56:02.463 --> 00:56:04.331
Nobody knows
who Donnie Wepner is

1362
00:56:04.333 --> 00:56:05.369
and you know what?

1363
00:56:06.804 --> 00:56:07.973
Nobody cares.

1364
00:56:09.042 --> 00:56:10.144
You know...

1365
00:56:11.981 --> 00:56:14.854
my wife knows me.

1366
00:56:16.492 --> 00:56:19.163
My kids know me.

1367
00:56:21.034 --> 00:56:23.771
And that's all
that matters to me.

1368
00:56:23.773 --> 00:56:27.010
Yeah, that is that all
that matters to you

1369
00:56:27.012 --> 00:56:28.179
but you know what?

1370
00:56:28.181 --> 00:56:30.083
But not to me, Donnie.

1371
00:56:30.085 --> 00:56:31.287
I'm gonna be somebody.

1372
00:56:32.256 --> 00:56:35.362
Hey! Hey! Then be a good father.

1373
00:56:35.364 --> 00:56:36.897
Be a good husband to your wife

1374
00:56:36.899 --> 00:56:38.435
and stop blowing
alimony money on,

1375
00:56:38.437 --> 00:56:41.308
on booze and cocaine and girls.

1376
00:56:45.116 --> 00:56:46.384
What?

1377
00:56:46.386 --> 00:56:48.822
I am a good father, all right?
My kids love me.

1378
00:56:48.824 --> 00:56:50.993
They know that I love them
because I fucking tell them.

1379
00:56:50.995 --> 00:56:52.295
And me and Phyllis
are better off now

1380
00:56:52.297 --> 00:56:53.832
than we've ever been.

1381
00:56:53.834 --> 00:56:55.436
So stop telling me
how to live my life

1382
00:56:55.438 --> 00:56:56.572
and how to run my family.

1383
00:56:56.574 --> 00:56:58.908
In fact, why don't you
just get the hell out of here?

1384
00:56:58.910 --> 00:57:00.111
'Cause you know I'm right?

1385
00:57:00.113 --> 00:57:02.249
No, because you're a jerk
who I can't be around right now,

1386
00:57:02.251 --> 00:57:03.519
so just get the fuck out!

1387
00:57:03.521 --> 00:57:05.222
I'm the jerk?

1388
00:57:05.224 --> 00:57:07.994
You're the one out there
fighting wrestlers

1389
00:57:07.996 --> 00:57:09.030
and I'm the jerk.

1390
00:57:09.032 --> 00:57:11.568
The whole world's laughing
at you like a clown

1391
00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:13.472
and I'm the jerk.

1392
00:57:13.474 --> 00:57:15.376
I think you're just
a Bayonne jackass.

1393
00:57:15.378 --> 00:57:16.814
Fuck you!

1394
00:57:21.122 --> 00:57:22.893
[clatters]

1395
00:57:29.206 --> 00:57:31.376
You don't talk to me anymore.

1396
00:57:31.378 --> 00:57:33.012
You don't tell me
how to live my life.

1397
00:57:33.014 --> 00:57:35.386
You don't tell me
how to run my family.

1398
00:57:36.922 --> 00:57:38.457
You don't talk to anyone
about me.

1399
00:57:38.459 --> 00:57:41.932
You pretend I don't exist
because you know what?

1400
00:57:43.436 --> 00:57:46.509
To me, you no longer exist.

1401
00:57:50.182 --> 00:57:51.218
Fine.

1402
00:57:53.523 --> 00:57:55.592
I'm out of here, you fuck.

1403
00:57:55.594 --> 00:57:58.263
[Chuck] Yeah, get the fuck
out of here, Donnie.

1404
00:57:58.265 --> 00:57:59.402
Get the fuck out of here.

1405
00:58:02.306 --> 00:58:03.308
[door bangs]

1406
00:58:06.983 --> 00:58:10.190
Blow it out. Blow it out. Blow!

1407
00:58:11.493 --> 00:58:13.529
Come on, push it, Chuckie!

1408
00:58:13.531 --> 00:58:14.699
Push it!

1409
00:58:17.204 --> 00:58:19.374
Give it your all.
That's it? That's all you got?

1410
00:58:19.376 --> 00:58:20.945
Push it, Chuckie!

1411
00:58:23.249 --> 00:58:24.386
A little more.

1412
00:58:24.754 --> 00:58:26.055
Time!

1413
00:58:31.265 --> 00:58:33.270
[heavy breathing]

1414
00:58:35.073 --> 00:58:36.176
How do you feel?

1415
00:58:36.811 --> 00:58:39.015
[panting]

1416
00:58:43.391 --> 00:58:45.627
- Chuckie?
- [Chuck] What's up, Al?

1417
00:58:45.629 --> 00:58:47.634
You ever think about
hanging up the gloves?

1418
00:58:49.236 --> 00:58:50.372
Retiring?

1419
00:58:52.208 --> 00:58:54.143
No.
[exhales]

1420
00:58:54.145 --> 00:58:55.550
I think you should.

1421
00:58:59.123 --> 00:59:00.527
You really think it's that time?

1422
00:59:01.562 --> 00:59:02.797
[Al] You're overdue.

1423
00:59:07.139 --> 00:59:09.509
But you had a hell of a ride.

1424
00:59:09.511 --> 00:59:11.750
A lot better than most guys
with your skill set.

1425
00:59:13.251 --> 00:59:14.722
You should be proud of yourself.

1426
00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:19.231
Better you get out while
you still got all your marbles.

1427
00:59:20.367 --> 00:59:21.770
You're doing the right thing.

1428
00:59:25.477 --> 00:59:26.580
What's it like?

1429
00:59:27.615 --> 00:59:28.784
You know, to...

1430
00:59:29.552 --> 00:59:30.789
to stop fighting?

1431
00:59:33.594 --> 00:59:35.765
I felt relieved. Most guys do.

1432
00:59:40.206 --> 00:59:41.744
No, you're doing
the right thing.

1433
00:59:47.321 --> 00:59:49.290
It was a great ride, huh, Al?

1434
00:59:49.292 --> 00:59:50.760
[Al exhales]

1435
00:59:50.762 --> 00:59:52.229
[Al] Yeah, kid.

1436
00:59:52.231 --> 00:59:53.666
[Chuck]
<i>I was hanging up the gloves</i>

1437
00:59:53.668 --> 00:59:56.605
<i>but I still needed cash.
And I won't lie to you.</i>

1438
00:59:56.607 --> 00:59:58.274
<i>I missed the action.</i>

1439
00:59:58.276 --> 01:00:01.750
[Artie] I was presented
with the... an opportunity.

1440
01:00:01.752 --> 01:00:03.587
- What kind of opportunity?
- A fight.

1441
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:05.824
Well, I mean, uh,
I'm not really fighting, but...

1442
01:00:05.826 --> 01:00:07.528
You ever been to the circus?

1443
01:00:07.530 --> 01:00:09.632
- Yeah, I've been to the circus.
- Like, a big circus?

1444
01:00:09.634 --> 01:00:10.668
Where they got,
like, animals and shit?

1445
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:12.505
The one, you know,
that come around with the...

1446
01:00:12.507 --> 01:00:15.544
Yeah, well, they got, like,
uh, bears at the circus.

1447
01:00:15.546 --> 01:00:17.280
Big fucking trained bears
that could, like,

1448
01:00:17.282 --> 01:00:19.853
walk on balls and shit
and do tricks

1449
01:00:19.855 --> 01:00:20.989
and fucking, yeah.

1450
01:00:20.991 --> 01:00:21.857
And kids love them.

1451
01:00:21.859 --> 01:00:23.093
Anyway, this guy comes
into the club

1452
01:00:23.095 --> 01:00:26.767
and he says he wants to put on,
like, a fucking exhibition.

1453
01:00:26.769 --> 01:00:28.237
[Artie] He's trying
to set up a fight.

1454
01:00:30.911 --> 01:00:32.479
With a bear?

1455
01:00:32.481 --> 01:00:34.550
[Artie] Yeah, with a bear.

1456
01:00:34.552 --> 01:00:35.752
You want me to fight a bear?

1457
01:00:35.754 --> 01:00:37.323
Would you fight a bear?

1458
01:00:39.328 --> 01:00:41.865
I mean, like, if want to say no,
I'd completely understand.

1459
01:00:41.867 --> 01:00:45.573
It is kind of a fucking
crazy question, I know, but...

1460
01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:48.579
How much money you,
uh, you get to fight a bear?

1461
01:00:48.581 --> 01:00:49.714
I haven't negotiated with him,

1462
01:00:49.716 --> 01:00:51.050
but you'd get a set fee
for the fight,

1463
01:00:51.052 --> 01:00:53.889
and then I would give you
a piece of the door.

1464
01:00:53.891 --> 01:00:55.962
[Artie] Man, that's
a pretty good fucking deal, man.

1465
01:00:57.565 --> 01:00:58.567
What do you say?

1466
01:01:00.438 --> 01:01:01.505
I believe in you, Chuck.

1467
01:01:01.507 --> 01:01:03.843
I think you can kick
the bear's ass.

1468
01:01:03.845 --> 01:01:05.613
- You think I can beat a bear?
- Yeah.

1469
01:01:05.615 --> 01:01:07.753
I think you would kick
his ass all over the place.

1470
01:01:08.855 --> 01:01:10.022
Come on!

1471
01:01:10.024 --> 01:01:11.893
Fight the fucking bear, Chuck!

1472
01:01:11.895 --> 01:01:13.696
People paid the money!

1473
01:01:13.698 --> 01:01:15.600
Come on, you fucking bear!

1474
01:01:15.602 --> 01:01:17.404
Hit him in the fucking balls!

1475
01:01:17.406 --> 01:01:20.610
Chuck! Chuck! Chuck!

1476
01:01:20.612 --> 01:01:23.683
Chuck! Chuck! Chuck!

1477
01:01:23.685 --> 01:01:26.724
Chuck! Chuck! Chuck!

1478
01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:30.598
[Chuck] <i>Victor's trainer
finally stopped the fight,</i>

1479
01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.134
<i>so I guess I won.</i>

1480
01:01:32.136 --> 01:01:35.006
<i>My last fight was a victory
against Victor the Bear.</i>

1481
01:01:35.008 --> 01:01:36.944
<i>The fight with the bear
was good for laughs,</i>

1482
01:01:36.946 --> 01:01:39.651
<i>but now it was time to party.</i>

1483
01:01:41.856 --> 01:01:43.190
Coke for the weekend.

1484
01:01:43.192 --> 01:01:44.759
- [shushes]
- I, I'm having a big party.

1485
01:01:44.761 --> 01:01:46.632
I, I need to really excite
my guests.

1486
01:01:48.035 --> 01:01:50.638
Come on, man.

1487
01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.575
I'm not really
a drug dealer or anything.

1488
01:01:52.577 --> 01:01:53.778
[Roger] Really, it's,
it's a lot of money.

1489
01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:54.847
You just get me
as much as you can.

1490
01:01:54.849 --> 01:01:55.983
I trust you.

1491
01:01:55.985 --> 01:01:57.686
You know, Artie tells me
great things about you and I...

1492
01:01:57.688 --> 01:01:58.755
You know, I know you
from the past.

1493
01:01:58.757 --> 01:01:59.824
Get it to me by Friday?

1494
01:01:59.826 --> 01:02:01.026
I'll get you the blow by Friday.

1495
01:02:01.028 --> 01:02:01.895
[Roger] By Friday?

1496
01:02:01.897 --> 01:02:04.969
I'll get you the coke by Friday.
Jesus.

1497
01:02:06.806 --> 01:02:08.141
[Chuck]
<i>So Roger needed some coke</i>

1498
01:02:08.143 --> 01:02:09.844
<i>and I knew where to get it.</i>

1499
01:02:09.846 --> 01:02:12.051
<i>No problem. My connect
could take care of that.</i>

1500
01:02:17.128 --> 01:02:19.132
[siren blaring]

1501
01:02:22.104 --> 01:02:23.606
Step out of the car!

1502
01:02:23.608 --> 01:02:25.777
Get the fuck out of the car!

1503
01:02:25.779 --> 01:02:26.948
Get out.

1504
01:02:30.689 --> 01:02:32.824
What's going on, officer?

1505
01:02:32.826 --> 01:02:34.163
Hands up against the wall.

1506
01:02:35.866 --> 01:02:37.902
[police #1] What do we got?
What do we got? What do we got?

1507
01:02:37.904 --> 01:02:39.741
- I got a gun.
- [police #2] We got a gun!

1508
01:02:43.816 --> 01:02:45.918
- [police #1] Another gun.
- [police #2] We got another gun.

1509
01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:48.057
- It's registered.
- That's nice.

1510
01:02:51.598 --> 01:02:53.702
- Hard candy. We got candy.
- [police #3] Let me get it.

1511
01:02:55.206 --> 01:02:56.842
Ah, look at this.
Hot, it looks to me.

1512
01:03:01.953 --> 01:03:02.955
Come on.

1513
01:03:04.658 --> 01:03:05.861
Tilt to the side.

1514
01:03:06.929 --> 01:03:07.965
Get in.

1515
01:03:13.977 --> 01:03:17.182
[Chuck] <i>I made an error
in judgment. Uh, a mistake.</i>

1516
01:03:17.184 --> 01:03:20.255
I let down my friends,
my family, my fans,

1517
01:03:20.257 --> 01:03:23.362
and most importantly,
my community.

1518
01:03:23.364 --> 01:03:25.165
And for that, I truly am sorry.

1519
01:03:25.167 --> 01:03:26.835
This is a drug case

1520
01:03:26.837 --> 01:03:29.674
and violence and drugs
often go together.

1521
01:03:29.676 --> 01:03:32.847
You have indeed committed
a serious offense.

1522
01:03:32.849 --> 01:03:35.151
Drugs kill, Mr. Wepner.

1523
01:03:35.153 --> 01:03:37.290
So violence is always inherent,

1524
01:03:37.292 --> 01:03:40.096
and I believe it's inherent
in you.

1525
01:03:40.098 --> 01:03:42.166
You're hereby remanded
to the custody

1526
01:03:42.168 --> 01:03:43.669
of the State Department
of Corrections

1527
01:03:43.671 --> 01:03:46.776
to serve a prison term
of ten years.

1528
01:03:46.778 --> 01:03:49.314
[Chuck] <i>Six-by-eight
and a top bunk.</i>

1529
01:03:49.316 --> 01:03:51.017
<i>That's all the room I had
to think about</i>

1530
01:03:51.019 --> 01:03:52.387
<i>for the next ten years.</i>

1531
01:03:52.389 --> 01:03:54.290
[man] They got me locked up
here with a celebrity.

1532
01:03:54.292 --> 01:03:56.228
Ah, I'm not that famous.

1533
01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:59.268
Hey, what do you mean?
You fought Ali.

1534
01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:01.908
I bet you got one of those
big old houses and everything.

1535
01:04:03.145 --> 01:04:04.845
No.

1536
01:04:04.847 --> 01:04:06.716
[Chuck] <i>All this for trying
to look like a big shot</i>

1537
01:04:06.718 --> 01:04:08.454
<i>that can score some dope
for a bunch of assholes</i>

1538
01:04:08.456 --> 01:04:10.426
<i>who couldn't care less about me.</i>

1539
01:04:11.428 --> 01:04:12.829
<i>Yeah, prison beat me up</i>

1540
01:04:12.831 --> 01:04:14.733
<i>worse than any fighter
could have.</i>

1541
01:04:14.735 --> 01:04:16.202
<i>I'd failed.</i>

1542
01:04:16.204 --> 01:04:17.473
<i>I'd finally become the man</i>

1543
01:04:17.475 --> 01:04:20.277
<i>I thought I fought so hard
to avoid.</i>

1544
01:04:20.279 --> 01:04:22.784
<i>I was exactly where a thug
from Bayonne should be.</i>

1545
01:04:23.853 --> 01:04:25.221
<i>Locked up.</i>

1546
01:04:25.223 --> 01:04:27.125
You know, Stallone
based <i>Rocky off me.</i>

1547
01:04:27.127 --> 01:04:29.463
Well, at least that's
what he said in the papers.

1548
01:04:29.465 --> 01:04:31.501
You know Stallone?

1549
01:04:31.503 --> 01:04:33.471
I auditioned for <i>Rocky II.</i>

1550
01:04:33.473 --> 01:04:34.840
He's a cool guy.

1551
01:04:34.842 --> 01:04:36.844
[laughs]
[man] Wow.

1552
01:04:36.846 --> 01:04:39.184
Damn, you gotta be
making bank from these movies.

1553
01:04:40.788 --> 01:04:42.055
[Sylvester] It was bad apples.

1554
01:04:42.057 --> 01:04:43.858
You know, sometimes you eat
good apples...

1555
01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:47.933
[Chuck] <i>Just like out of some
bizarre dream, there he was.</i>

1556
01:04:47.935 --> 01:04:49.270
You make a lot of money, huh?

1557
01:04:49.272 --> 01:04:51.274
Well, you know,
a little bit here and there.

1558
01:04:51.276 --> 01:04:52.810
How much? How much, man?

1559
01:04:52.812 --> 01:04:54.146
- Come on, man, I don't know.
- Come on.

1560
01:04:54.148 --> 01:04:57.052
- It cost me a lot of money.
- [all laugh]

1561
01:04:57.054 --> 01:04:58.990
[Chuck] No fucking way.

1562
01:04:58.992 --> 01:05:01.060
Hey, Chuck.

1563
01:05:01.062 --> 01:05:02.364
What are you doing here?

1564
01:05:02.366 --> 01:05:03.600
I'm doing time.
What are you doing here?

1565
01:05:03.602 --> 01:05:04.868
Doing time?

1566
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:06.070
Oh, go hard.

1567
01:05:06.072 --> 01:05:08.141
I'm doing a prison movie, Chuck.
It's called <i>Lock Up.</i>

1568
01:05:08.143 --> 01:05:09.878
Hey, you guys, come here,
come here.

1569
01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:11.449
You see this guy here?

1570
01:05:11.451 --> 01:05:13.520
[Sylvester] This guy
was the inspiration for <i>Rocky.</i>

1571
01:05:13.522 --> 01:05:14.921
Yeah, him.

1572
01:05:14.923 --> 01:05:16.025
Yeah, this guy right here.

1573
01:05:16.027 --> 01:05:17.227
Hey, guys,
you gotta do me a favor.

1574
01:05:17.229 --> 01:05:18.497
You gotta take care
of this guy, okay?

1575
01:05:18.499 --> 01:05:20.233
- We'll take care of him.
- All right, thanks, Sly.

1576
01:05:20.235 --> 01:05:21.936
[Sylvester] Hey, listen, Chuck,
it was good seeing you.

1577
01:05:21.938 --> 01:05:24.174
I got to get back to work.
It was good seeing you all.

1578
01:05:24.176 --> 01:05:25.243
I'll probably...

1579
01:05:25.245 --> 01:05:26.379
Maybe I'll see you all,
I'm sure.

1580
01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:27.482
You guys, make sure.

1581
01:05:27.484 --> 01:05:30.019
I'm telling you, this is...
This guy's the real guy.

1582
01:05:30.021 --> 01:05:31.390
- All right, Sly.
- Good seeing you.

1583
01:05:31.392 --> 01:05:32.392
[Sylvester] All right, Chuck.

1584
01:05:32.394 --> 01:05:34.396
- All right, I'll see you, okay?
- All right, Sly.

1585
01:05:34.398 --> 01:05:35.565
Take care, guys. See you around.

1586
01:05:35.567 --> 01:05:37.602
[Chuck]
<i>Seeing him in there was hard.</i>

1587
01:05:37.604 --> 01:05:39.105
<i>He was doing so well.</i>

1588
01:05:39.107 --> 01:05:40.307
The real Rocky here.

1589
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:42.213
<i>And me,
I was trolling the bottom.</i>

1590
01:05:46.989 --> 01:05:48.692
I feel like such
a piece of shit.

1591
01:05:48.694 --> 01:05:49.895
I mean...

1592
01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:53.337
I know I fucked this all up.

1593
01:05:55.408 --> 01:05:59.281
I'm willing
to, uh, wait for you.

1594
01:06:01.219 --> 01:06:03.958
[Linda] If you think
you can change, then...

1595
01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:08.266
you can come live with me
when you get out.

1596
01:06:09.101 --> 01:06:10.303
That would be...

1597
01:06:11.473 --> 01:06:12.608
the best thing, ever.

1598
01:06:12.610 --> 01:06:15.013
I mean, I got nothing anymore
but you and I know it.

1599
01:06:15.616 --> 01:06:17.386
I care about you.

1600
01:06:20.626 --> 01:06:22.563
It's good to know someone does.

1601
01:06:24.166 --> 01:06:25.369
Don't give up.

1602
01:06:27.406 --> 01:06:28.542
Don't.

1603
01:06:30.244 --> 01:06:32.013
[Chuck] <i>The only thing
that got me through prison</i>

1604
01:06:32.015 --> 01:06:33.617
<i>was knowing that Linda
would be waiting for me</i>

1605
01:06:33.619 --> 01:06:34.954
<i>on the other side.</i>

1606
01:06:36.323 --> 01:06:37.625
[Linda] <i>Welcome home, Chuck.</i>

1607
01:06:37.627 --> 01:06:39.563
[Chuck] <i>I mean, when that fence
opened up,</i>

1608
01:06:39.565 --> 01:06:41.767
<i>I knew the true meaning
of a second chance.</i>

1609
01:06:41.769 --> 01:06:44.575
<i>I've never been so happy
and so scared at the same time.</i>

1610
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:47.514
<i>Happy to be with her and, uh...</i>

1611
01:06:48.281 --> 01:06:49.616
Time to celebrate.

1612
01:06:49.618 --> 01:06:51.522
<i>...scared shitless
I'd fuck it up somehow.</i>

1613
01:06:53.258 --> 01:06:54.326
What's wrong?

1614
01:06:54.328 --> 01:06:57.568
It's... I, um, you know,
I don't deserve all this.

1615
01:06:58.837 --> 01:07:00.272
Yes, you do.

1616
01:07:03.278 --> 01:07:05.146
I love you, Linda.

1617
01:07:05.148 --> 01:07:07.187
Oh, I love you, too, Chuck.

1618
01:07:11.463 --> 01:07:13.698
[Chuck] <i>Life was the best
when it was simple.</i>

1619
01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:16.371
<i>We didn't have much
and I wasn't a movie star</i>

1620
01:07:16.373 --> 01:07:17.606
<i>or a heavyweight champ,</i>

1621
01:07:17.608 --> 01:07:19.745
<i>but I didn't need to be
any of that.</i>

1622
01:07:19.747 --> 01:07:23.319
<i>I had someone who cared about me
and a place to go home to.</i>

1623
01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:26.091
I, uh...

1624
01:07:27.696 --> 01:07:28.829
Will you marry me, Linda?

1625
01:07:28.831 --> 01:07:31.267
[Linda chuckles]

1626
01:07:31.269 --> 01:07:32.573
- [Chuck] Yeah?
- Yes.

1627
01:07:33.608 --> 01:07:34.875
- Yes?
- Yes!

1628
01:07:34.877 --> 01:07:36.445
Oh, my god!

1629
01:07:36.447 --> 01:07:38.416
[squeal]

1630
01:07:38.418 --> 01:07:40.120
You want to marry me?

1631
01:08:38.541 --> 01:08:39.609
Hi.

1632
01:08:53.370 --> 01:08:55.339
[Chuck] <i>I was back
to selling liquor again.</i>

1633
01:08:55.341 --> 01:08:57.945
<i>It wasn't the best job,
but I was making it work.</i>

1634
01:08:57.947 --> 01:09:00.786
<i>More importantly,
I was keeping my nose clean.</i>

1635
01:09:20.894 --> 01:09:22.597
- Hey, uh, Dave.
- Hey.

1636
01:09:23.733 --> 01:09:25.033
What the fuck is this?

1637
01:09:25.035 --> 01:09:25.935
It's your paycheck.

1638
01:09:25.937 --> 01:09:28.507
I think it's missing
a zero at the end.

1639
01:09:28.509 --> 01:09:30.545
Look, things ain't what they
used to be, you know, right?

1640
01:09:30.547 --> 01:09:31.780
Nobody's paying top dollar

1641
01:09:31.782 --> 01:09:33.450
for the bring
your own booze anymore.

1642
01:09:33.452 --> 01:09:35.989
Yeah, it's not my booze,
but, you know, it'd be nice

1643
01:09:35.991 --> 01:09:38.762
if I can get a bit bigger
of a check, you know.

1644
01:09:38.764 --> 01:09:40.599
I'm surprised here
because, you know,

1645
01:09:40.601 --> 01:09:42.068
I sold more liquor
for this company

1646
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:43.505
than any of the salesmen.

1647
01:09:43.507 --> 01:09:46.544
Twenty years ago.
It's the 21st century.

1648
01:09:46.546 --> 01:09:48.682
The only guys that are famous
from boxing anymore

1649
01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:51.888
are Ali, Tyson,
George Foreman, Rocky.

1650
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:53.425
You're a good salesman, Chuck.

1651
01:09:53.427 --> 01:09:54.997
Just not as famous
as you once were.

1652
01:10:28.498 --> 01:10:30.266
Uh, I went to look for you
on the floor,

1653
01:10:30.268 --> 01:10:31.705
but they said
you was up here now.

1654
01:10:38.051 --> 01:10:40.222
It's been so many years, Chuck.

1655
01:10:50.911 --> 01:10:52.113
I'm an idiot.

1656
01:10:56.689 --> 01:10:57.858
I love you, bro.

1657
01:11:10.017 --> 01:11:14.593
So, uh, tell me
about prison, bro.

1658
01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:16.062
[laughs]

1659
01:11:18.768 --> 01:11:19.936
[exhales]

1660
01:11:20.772 --> 01:11:22.205
You got a sec?

1661
01:11:22.207 --> 01:11:23.476
What's going on?

1662
01:11:23.478 --> 01:11:27.116
I got a shop called Ginsberg's
and we do sports memorabilia.

1663
01:11:27.118 --> 01:11:29.187
We do all that kind of stuff,
you know?

1664
01:11:29.189 --> 01:11:31.725
"Ginsberg Sports Memorabilia."

1665
01:11:31.727 --> 01:11:33.629
We deal a lot
of high-end clientele,

1666
01:11:33.631 --> 01:11:35.633
and, uh, you know, we want
to talk business with you.

1667
01:11:35.635 --> 01:11:36.702
You should come down.

1668
01:11:36.704 --> 01:11:38.406
So you do, like,
you know, signings?

1669
01:11:38.408 --> 01:11:39.675
All that kind of stuff?

1670
01:11:39.677 --> 01:11:40.677
We do everything.

1671
01:11:40.679 --> 01:11:41.979
We do everything sports
memorabilia and stuff.

1672
01:11:41.981 --> 01:11:43.048
Good money.

1673
01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:44.117
You come in.
You sign some stuff.

1674
01:11:44.119 --> 01:11:45.086
It's way better than this.

1675
01:11:45.088 --> 01:11:47.392
We deal with, like,
Muhammad Ali, you know?

1676
01:11:47.394 --> 01:11:50.030
- [Chuck] Oh, you got Muhammad?
- Yeah, Muhammad.

1677
01:11:50.032 --> 01:11:51.732
Uh, Jackie Robinson.

1678
01:11:51.734 --> 01:11:54.439
Uh, Jake LaMotta.
Like, everybody.

1679
01:11:54.441 --> 01:11:56.743
All right.
Well, it was nice meeting you.

1680
01:11:56.745 --> 01:11:58.414
Can you... Can you sign this?

1681
01:11:58.416 --> 01:12:00.152
I know, I'm sorry.

1682
01:12:01.388 --> 01:12:03.726
All right, here you go.

1683
01:12:05.797 --> 01:12:07.264
You're the best, champ.
Thank you so much.

1684
01:12:07.266 --> 01:12:09.101
[Chuck]
<i>I had my doubts about Olson.</i>

1685
01:12:09.103 --> 01:12:11.005
<i>He was up to no good
and I fucking knew it,</i>

1686
01:12:11.007 --> 01:12:13.009
<i>but the money came so easy.</i>

1687
01:12:13.011 --> 01:12:14.746
<i>See, it's hard to make
the right decision</i>

1688
01:12:14.748 --> 01:12:17.051
<i>when you know the money's
right there in your face.</i>

1689
01:12:17.053 --> 01:12:18.320
- Here you go. Here's a photo.
- I'm so excited to meet you.

1690
01:12:18.322 --> 01:12:19.957
- What's your name?
- Theresa.

1691
01:12:19.959 --> 01:12:21.061
Theresa, all right.

1692
01:12:23.199 --> 01:12:24.834
- There you are.
- Get the next one.

1693
01:12:24.836 --> 01:12:25.903
I'll never share.

1694
01:12:25.905 --> 01:12:27.272
Oh, my god,
I'll follow you forever.

1695
01:12:27.274 --> 01:12:29.042
Thank you. Absolutely.

1696
01:12:29.044 --> 01:12:30.413
[Chuck] <i>The more money
I got off Olson,</i>

1697
01:12:30.415 --> 01:12:31.915
<i>the more I kept getting
the feeling</i>

1698
01:12:31.917 --> 01:12:33.318
<i>that he was up to no good.</i>

1699
01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:34.854
<i>I couldn't stop, though.</i>

1700
01:12:34.856 --> 01:12:37.092
<i>I mean, 300 bucks
for signing some gloves</i>

1701
01:12:37.094 --> 01:12:38.862
<i>and another $200 for a picture?</i>

1702
01:12:38.864 --> 01:12:40.232
<i>I knew it was too good
to be true</i>

1703
01:12:40.234 --> 01:12:42.771
<i>but it beat busting
my ass selling booze.</i>

1704
01:12:42.773 --> 01:12:44.374
[Olson] Chuck.
Hey, man, how you doing?

1705
01:12:44.376 --> 01:12:45.843
- Come on in, Come on in.
- Hey, John.

1706
01:12:45.845 --> 01:12:47.881
- How you doing?
- Look at this place.

1707
01:12:47.883 --> 01:12:49.552
[Olson] Yeah.
Did you see upstairs? Ginsburg?

1708
01:12:49.554 --> 01:12:51.321
- It's awesome.
- [Olson] Right.

1709
01:12:51.323 --> 01:12:53.360
You gotta get a boxing ring
in the middle.

1710
01:12:53.362 --> 01:12:55.298
[Olson] Yeah, yeah, we should.
You're right.

1711
01:12:56.901 --> 01:12:58.503
Come on in. Come on in.
Let's hit some balls.

1712
01:12:58.505 --> 01:12:59.372
Let's, let's talk.

1713
01:12:59.374 --> 01:13:00.907
Oh, you're gonna
make me play baseball?

1714
01:13:00.909 --> 01:13:03.246
- [Olson] Yeah, why not?
- All right.

1715
01:13:03.248 --> 01:13:05.250
- Right? A guy like you?
- Look at this.

1716
01:13:05.252 --> 01:13:08.055
Really smack
the crap out of the ball.

1717
01:13:08.057 --> 01:13:10.059
It's been awhile
since I've been in a cage.

1718
01:13:10.061 --> 01:13:11.463
Yeah, I'm glad you came back.

1719
01:13:11.465 --> 01:13:12.898
I'm sorry I couldn't see you
the other day.

1720
01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:14.436
I had a thing.
I was dealing with Muhammad Ali.

1721
01:13:14.438 --> 01:13:15.938
Yeah, I came by
and you weren't here.

1722
01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:17.142
Yeah, I was in Vegas, you know.

1723
01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:19.580
Let me ask you something.

1724
01:13:19.582 --> 01:13:21.216
You, uh, you know, with these...

1725
01:13:21.218 --> 01:13:22.586
with these signatures
and all that,

1726
01:13:22.588 --> 01:13:25.425
what kind of money,
you know, is in that?

1727
01:13:25.427 --> 01:13:27.094
We can make
a lot of money, Chuck.

1728
01:13:27.096 --> 01:13:29.098
And I'm not talking
about 20 bucks an autograph.

1729
01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:30.468
All right, I saw what
you were doing the other day.

1730
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:32.305
- Yeah.
- And that's great, okay?

1731
01:13:32.307 --> 01:13:34.977
It's a good little scratch,
a little side thing.

1732
01:13:34.979 --> 01:13:37.517
But we think you should be
at the next level.

1733
01:13:37.519 --> 01:13:38.951
I can make you a lot more money.

1734
01:13:38.953 --> 01:13:40.423
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1735
01:13:40.425 --> 01:13:42.259
- Listen, do me a favor.
- Yeah.

1736
01:13:42.261 --> 01:13:43.329
Hit that ball.

1737
01:13:43.331 --> 01:13:44.930
- Hit this ball?
- Hit that ball.

1738
01:13:44.932 --> 01:13:46.934
[thuds]

1739
01:13:46.936 --> 01:13:48.171
You know what you just hit?

1740
01:13:48.173 --> 01:13:49.306
[Chuck] No, what'd I just hit?

1741
01:13:49.308 --> 01:13:51.611
You just hit a $10,000 baseball.
Is what you just hit.

1742
01:13:51.613 --> 01:13:54.484
[Chuck] There's no such thing
as a $10,000 baseball.

1743
01:13:54.486 --> 01:13:55.619
It's a Babe Ruth.

1744
01:13:55.621 --> 01:13:57.457
[Chuck]
<i>Olson was a real fucking weasel.</i>

1745
01:13:57.459 --> 01:13:59.595
<i>Slick as they come,
that guy was.</i>

1746
01:13:59.597 --> 01:14:02.470
<i>I didn't like him,
but I liked the money.</i>

1747
01:14:17.333 --> 01:14:19.402
[laughs]

1748
01:14:19.404 --> 01:14:21.140
Holy shit.

1749
01:14:24.045 --> 01:14:26.316
Oh, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.

1750
01:14:27.654 --> 01:14:29.556
You done good.

1751
01:14:29.558 --> 01:14:32.762
Unbelievable. That's Babe Ruth.

1752
01:14:32.764 --> 01:14:34.568
That's fucking Babe Ruth!

1753
01:14:36.739 --> 01:14:38.574
I'll just throw it in there.

1754
01:14:38.576 --> 01:14:41.078
[Olson] Who could I do today?
Who am I gonna be today?

1755
01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.482
[Warfield]
<i>You gotta love Babe Ruth.</i>

1756
01:14:42.484 --> 01:14:45.020
My grandfather saw him
in Philadelphia.

1757
01:14:45.022 --> 01:14:46.356
He's so lucky.

1758
01:14:46.358 --> 01:14:48.728
I wish I was alive and I wish
I was back then.

1759
01:14:48.730 --> 01:14:50.766
What are all these?

1760
01:14:50.768 --> 01:14:54.206
Ah, you know, I've been doing
some signings recently.

1761
01:14:54.208 --> 01:14:55.676
Trying to make some extra cash.

1762
01:14:55.678 --> 01:14:58.080
Getting fan mail.
Look. All these.

1763
01:14:58.082 --> 01:14:59.517
[Linda] <i>Since we got
some extra coming in,</i>

1764
01:14:59.519 --> 01:15:03.525
<i>I thought maybe
we could go away with a trip.</i>

1765
01:15:03.527 --> 01:15:06.397
[Chuck] <i>I love that idea.
Paris. Warren.</i>

1766
01:15:06.399 --> 01:15:08.403
[camera shutter clicks]

1767
01:15:20.395 --> 01:15:24.267
[Corbin] <i>This is going to be
the biggest raid in FBI history.</i>

1768
01:15:24.269 --> 01:15:26.572
It's called Operation Bullpen.

1769
01:15:26.574 --> 01:15:28.208
It centers around
certain criminals

1770
01:15:28.210 --> 01:15:31.249
who think it's okay
to forge memorabilia autographs.

1771
01:15:33.489 --> 01:15:34.656
- Incredible player.
- Oh, my god.

1772
01:15:34.658 --> 01:15:36.826
- Did you just hear that?
- Yeah, I did.

1773
01:15:36.828 --> 01:15:38.599
- Oh, my god.
- This guy Olson's unbelievable.

1774
01:15:39.768 --> 01:15:41.336
[Diamond] Oh, my gosh.

1775
01:15:41.338 --> 01:15:42.807
Let's get these fuckers.

1776
01:15:51.425 --> 01:15:53.227
[car door bangs close]

1777
01:15:54.899 --> 01:15:57.836
Special Agent-in-Charge
John Corbin.

1778
01:15:57.838 --> 01:16:00.408
We have an arrest warrant
for John Olson.

1779
01:16:00.410 --> 01:16:01.846
- [Palazzo] Where is he?
- He's downstairs.

1780
01:16:05.754 --> 01:16:07.288
Oh, shit.

1781
01:16:07.290 --> 01:16:08.526
Fuck you!

1782
01:16:10.564 --> 01:16:12.532
[Chuck]
<i>Olson was a real con man.</i>

1783
01:16:12.534 --> 01:16:14.302
<i>He was part of
a multimillion-dollar</i>

1784
01:16:14.304 --> 01:16:15.806
<i>memorabilia forgery ring</i>

1785
01:16:15.808 --> 01:16:17.644
<i>that was a coast-to-coast
business.</i>

1786
01:16:17.646 --> 01:16:18.712
Turn around!

1787
01:16:18.714 --> 01:16:21.652
- There's no crying in baseball.
- [Olson] Fuck you.

1788
01:16:21.654 --> 01:16:23.389
- [Warfield] Fuck you.
- Come on, man, those are real.

1789
01:16:23.391 --> 01:16:25.526
[Chuck]
<i>It was called Operation Bullpen</i>

1790
01:16:25.528 --> 01:16:27.897
<i>because most of the swag
was baseball stuff.</i>

1791
01:16:27.899 --> 01:16:29.868
[Olsen] <i>You see,
the inventory comes in</i>

1792
01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:32.807
and I just take it and I just,
you know, I clean it up.

1793
01:16:32.809 --> 01:16:33.877
You know what I mean?
I just clean...

1794
01:16:33.879 --> 01:16:35.245
I just clean it up.
I take the ball.

1795
01:16:35.247 --> 01:16:37.684
I take the autograph. I take...

1796
01:16:37.686 --> 01:16:39.253
[Chuck]
<i>Now, looking back on it...</i>

1797
01:16:39.255 --> 01:16:41.324
...make sure if it's, like,
you know, age and stuff.

1798
01:16:41.326 --> 01:16:42.861
And I just...
I do, like, detail work...

1799
01:16:42.863 --> 01:16:44.632
[Chuck] <i>...I'd probably be
better off selling booze.</i>

1800
01:16:44.634 --> 01:16:46.436
...my forte is detail lifts.

1801
01:16:46.438 --> 01:16:49.811
<i>My part was small potatoes,
but try telling that to Linda.</i>

1802
01:16:58.428 --> 01:16:59.597
Go.

1803
01:17:01.534 --> 01:17:03.002
Chuck Wepner.

1804
01:17:03.004 --> 01:17:05.073
Chuck Wepner, I have
a warrant for your arrest.

1805
01:17:05.075 --> 01:17:06.677
[Maddox] You have the right
to remain silent.

1806
01:17:06.679 --> 01:17:07.879
You have the right
to an attorney.

1807
01:17:07.881 --> 01:17:10.386
If you cannot afford one,
one will be provided for you.

1808
01:17:11.689 --> 01:17:13.958
Bring enough guys
to arrest an old man?

1809
01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:14.960
What's going on?

1810
01:17:14.962 --> 01:17:17.599
Ma'am, your husband's
being taken into custody

1811
01:17:17.601 --> 01:17:19.870
for his involvement
in a sports memorabilia fraud.

1812
01:17:19.872 --> 01:17:22.041
There must be a mistake.
Tell him it's a mistake, Chuck.

1813
01:17:22.043 --> 01:17:23.444
Ma'am, if you didn't
see anything,

1814
01:17:23.446 --> 01:17:25.014
you will be obstructing
this case. Let's go.

1815
01:17:25.016 --> 01:17:26.517
Don't worry, honey.

1816
01:17:26.519 --> 01:17:28.789
Call my lawyer.
He'll take care of this.

1817
01:17:28.791 --> 01:17:30.728
You tell them it's a mistake!

1818
01:17:31.897 --> 01:17:33.865
[door closes]

1819
01:17:33.867 --> 01:17:35.803
We got everything
on tape already, Chuck.

1820
01:17:35.805 --> 01:17:37.406
What do you got on tape?

1821
01:17:37.408 --> 01:17:39.777
Everything. The deals.
The autographs.

1822
01:17:39.779 --> 01:17:41.614
The conspiracy
with you and Olson.

1823
01:17:41.616 --> 01:17:42.986
What do you do with John Olson?

1824
01:17:43.754 --> 01:17:45.022
I sign autographs.

1825
01:17:45.024 --> 01:17:46.558
Who wants your autograph?

1826
01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:48.628
You're a has-been.
You're washed up.

1827
01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:51.134
You fought a bear,
like, 40 years ago.

1828
01:17:51.136 --> 01:17:53.840
What have you done since?
Tell me.

1829
01:17:53.842 --> 01:17:55.877
In all of these, uh, wiretaps,

1830
01:17:55.879 --> 01:17:57.179
all this stuff you've been
talking about,

1831
01:17:57.181 --> 01:17:58.616
photographs, all that,

1832
01:17:58.618 --> 01:18:00.186
did you ever see me sign
any name

1833
01:18:00.188 --> 01:18:02.090
other than Chuck Wepner
or anything?

1834
01:18:02.092 --> 01:18:03.127
[Matheson] No.

1835
01:18:03.795 --> 01:18:05.129
So can I leave?

1836
01:18:05.131 --> 01:18:06.465
[Linda] <i>You had the world
in your hands</i>

1837
01:18:06.467 --> 01:18:07.734
<i>and you go and fuck it up!</i>

1838
01:18:07.736 --> 01:18:09.808
Why is that, Chuck? Why?

1839
01:18:12.647 --> 01:18:14.883
- Sorry, I... I didn't know.
- Bullshit!

1840
01:18:14.885 --> 01:18:17.490
You're not sorry and you knew
damn well what you were doing.

1841
01:18:18.893 --> 01:18:21.830
[Linda]
This is typical Chuck Wepner.

1842
01:18:21.832 --> 01:18:23.901
A guy who thinks
he can do anything he wants

1843
01:18:23.903 --> 01:18:26.539
because the world
keeps shitting on him.

1844
01:18:26.541 --> 01:18:29.014
You know, Chuck,
we all get shit on!

1845
01:18:30.549 --> 01:18:32.485
I don't need
a lecture right now.

1846
01:18:32.487 --> 01:18:33.955
Yes, you do need a lecture!

1847
01:18:33.957 --> 01:18:37.030
You need a lecture more than
you need anything in your life!

1848
01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:40.871
I just hope
it's not too late for you.

1849
01:18:43.810 --> 01:18:45.010
[exhales]

1850
01:18:45.012 --> 01:18:47.282
[Chuck] Hey, hey, it's not.

1851
01:18:47.284 --> 01:18:50.055
Don't you give up on me, Linda.
Don't you do it.

1852
01:18:50.057 --> 01:18:52.192
Don't give up on you?

1853
01:18:52.194 --> 01:18:55.900
So I can come visit you
in prison the rest of your life?

1854
01:18:55.902 --> 01:18:59.206
All I did was sign my name.
I didn't do anything wrong.

1855
01:18:59.208 --> 01:19:00.678
How do I know
you're not lying to me?

1856
01:19:02.081 --> 01:19:03.582
Why would we be here

1857
01:19:03.584 --> 01:19:05.087
if you were just signing
your name?

1858
01:19:10.832 --> 01:19:12.102
You look beautiful, by the way.

1859
01:19:12.769 --> 01:19:14.304
Fuck you!

1860
01:19:14.306 --> 01:19:15.908
[Linda] You're a fucking idiot!

1861
01:19:16.878 --> 01:19:18.278
Putting me in this position.

1862
01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:19.280
I fucking do nothing

1863
01:19:19.282 --> 01:19:21.686
but good things for you,
and you're fucking me.

1864
01:19:21.688 --> 01:19:23.322
You're fucking me.

1865
01:19:23.324 --> 01:19:25.292
I'm gonna fucking
grow old by myself.

1866
01:19:25.294 --> 01:19:27.631
I can't take care of myself.
I have no money coming in.

1867
01:19:27.633 --> 01:19:29.935
It's all from you,
so I'm fucked.

1868
01:19:29.937 --> 01:19:31.307
I'm fucked. Thanks, Chuck.

1869
01:19:33.845 --> 01:19:35.381
Okay, they're ready for you.

1870
01:19:35.383 --> 01:19:37.251
Now, Chuck,
we're all disappointed.

1871
01:19:37.253 --> 01:19:39.188
We're all fans.

1872
01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:40.257
[lawyer] You know, I...

1873
01:19:40.259 --> 01:19:42.194
Dealing with a degenerate
like this guy, Olson,

1874
01:19:42.196 --> 01:19:44.131
what the hell
was that all about?

1875
01:19:44.133 --> 01:19:45.000
I mean, come on, man.

1876
01:19:45.002 --> 01:19:46.639
You're getting too old
for this shit.

1877
01:19:47.707 --> 01:19:50.210
All right? Turn it over.

1878
01:19:50.212 --> 01:19:52.314
[Ferguson] Your client
pleads guilty to one count.

1879
01:19:52.316 --> 01:19:53.851
He does one day...

1880
01:19:53.853 --> 01:19:55.087
[Chuck] <i>And just like that,</i>

1881
01:19:55.089 --> 01:19:56.690
<i>I walk out with a slap
on the wrist.</i>

1882
01:19:56.692 --> 01:19:59.162
<i>My so-called participation
in this was a joke</i>

1883
01:19:59.164 --> 01:20:01.001
<i>and I was glad to have it
behind me.</i>

1884
01:20:03.106 --> 01:20:05.141
<i>Just when I was clear
of the Feds,</i>

1885
01:20:05.143 --> 01:20:08.381
<i>the universe decide to take
a dump on me one more time.</i>

1886
01:20:08.383 --> 01:20:10.719
Last time I saw you,
you was behind bars.

1887
01:20:10.721 --> 01:20:11.788
Well, I'm out now.

1888
01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:13.124
Broke as shit,
but I'm a free man.

1889
01:20:13.126 --> 01:20:14.961
Oh, kid, that's a shame.

1890
01:20:14.963 --> 01:20:17.065
[Chuck] <i>Turns out Stallone was
filming something in Bayonne.</i>

1891
01:20:17.067 --> 01:20:18.336
<i>Right in my backyard.</i>

1892
01:20:18.338 --> 01:20:20.406
Oh, we're doing this movie
<i>Cop Land.</i>

1893
01:20:20.408 --> 01:20:22.041
- Any good?
- Oh, yeah, it's great.

1894
01:20:22.043 --> 01:20:23.778
Big kid, De Niro is in it.

1895
01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:25.984
No way, Bobby D?
The <i>Raging Bull himself?</i>

1896
01:20:25.986 --> 01:20:27.888
- Why, you want to meet him?
- Yeah.

1897
01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:29.157
I'll get him.

1898
01:20:29.159 --> 01:20:31.729
Mr. Stallone, you're on standby.
They're ready for you on set.

1899
01:20:31.731 --> 01:20:32.797
Yeah, sure.

1900
01:20:32.799 --> 01:20:34.835
Hey, hey,
do you know who this is?

1901
01:20:34.837 --> 01:20:35.904
No, sir, I don't.

1902
01:20:35.906 --> 01:20:37.106
This is Chuck Wepner.

1903
01:20:37.108 --> 01:20:38.376
Hi, Mr. Wepner,
nice to meet you.

1904
01:20:38.378 --> 01:20:39.747
- I'm Maura.
- Hello, hi.

1905
01:20:40.214 --> 01:20:42.217
He was a boxer.

1906
01:20:42.219 --> 01:20:44.455
Oh, is this the fighter
you saw fight Ali?

1907
01:20:44.457 --> 01:20:45.591
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Wow.

1908
01:20:45.593 --> 01:20:49.865
This must be something,
standing next to Rocky, right?

1909
01:20:49.867 --> 01:20:50.937
Right?

1910
01:20:51.471 --> 01:20:52.538
Yeah, cute, huh?

1911
01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:55.076
You always hire such smart
alecks on these shoots?

1912
01:20:55.078 --> 01:20:56.880
Oh, Chuck, she didn't mean
anything by it.

1913
01:20:56.882 --> 01:20:58.015
You know what I mean?
She's young.

1914
01:20:58.017 --> 01:20:59.218
She don't even know who I am.

1915
01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:00.955
Maura, do me a favor, now.
I'll be with you in a minute.

1916
01:21:00.957 --> 01:21:02.259
- All right, just tell them.
- Okay.

1917
01:21:03.161 --> 01:21:04.332
You see Stallone?

1918
01:21:05.367 --> 01:21:07.336
Yeah, I saw him.

1919
01:21:07.338 --> 01:21:08.870
I felt like a real outsider
on that set.

1920
01:21:08.872 --> 01:21:10.975
Like a...
like a fan or something.

1921
01:21:10.977 --> 01:21:11.910
What are you talking about?

1922
01:21:11.912 --> 01:21:14.048
I mean, everyone calls me
the Real Rocky

1923
01:21:14.050 --> 01:21:15.219
but what do I get for it?
Nothing.

1924
01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.897
You should get compensated
for what they took from you.

1925
01:21:22.133 --> 01:21:23.000
You know?

1926
01:21:23.002 --> 01:21:25.573
What Stallone
did to you wasn't right.

1927
01:21:25.575 --> 01:21:27.876
[Linda] You've been a fighter
your whole life.

1928
01:21:27.878 --> 01:21:29.147
You're gonna throw in
the towel now?

1929
01:21:30.884 --> 01:21:32.154
What do you want me to do,
Linda?

1930
01:21:33.089 --> 01:21:34.359
I want you to fight him.

1931
01:21:35.928 --> 01:21:37.930
You want me
to kick Stallone's ass?

1932
01:21:37.932 --> 01:21:40.001
[Linda] Yeah, I do.

1933
01:21:40.003 --> 01:21:41.237
[Chuck] You've lost
your marbles, Linda.

1934
01:21:41.239 --> 01:21:42.375
No, I'm serious.

1935
01:21:43.176 --> 01:21:44.312
Go kick his ass.

1936
01:21:46.015 --> 01:21:48.151
You really want me to kick
Sylvester Stallone's ass?

1937
01:21:48.153 --> 01:21:50.524
Yeah, I do,
but not with your fists.

1938
01:21:50.526 --> 01:21:52.194
You do it with lawyers.

1939
01:21:53.096 --> 01:21:55.266
You sue him.

1940
01:21:55.268 --> 01:21:57.371
- For what?
- For ripping off your life.

1941
01:21:57.373 --> 01:21:58.440
He didn't rip off my life.

1942
01:21:58.442 --> 01:22:00.211
He said I... I inspired <i>Rocky.</i>

1943
01:22:01.648 --> 01:22:03.383
Oh, you're a lawyer now?

1944
01:22:03.385 --> 01:22:05.252
You know what that means?
No, you don't.

1945
01:22:05.254 --> 01:22:06.991
So go talk to a lawyer.

1946
01:22:08.428 --> 01:22:10.432
[Linda] They made billions
off you, Chuck.

1947
01:22:11.569 --> 01:22:13.204
And what did you get for it?

1948
01:22:14.307 --> 01:22:15.943
Nothing but a pat on the back.

1949
01:22:18.516 --> 01:22:20.217
Think about it.

1950
01:22:20.219 --> 01:22:21.389
It's not so crazy.

1951
01:22:26.264 --> 01:22:29.068
I don't know, I mean,
I'm not used to suing people.

1952
01:22:29.070 --> 01:22:31.205
Last time I was in court,
they were putting me in jail.

1953
01:22:31.207 --> 01:22:32.645
You got nothing to lose.

1954
01:22:38.221 --> 01:22:39.324
[Linda] You should.

1955
01:22:40.293 --> 01:22:41.496
Get what's yours.

1956
01:22:44.569 --> 01:22:46.272
It's the other way around now.

1957
01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:48.343
It's your turn.

1958
01:22:49.746 --> 01:22:51.583
It's time to lace up them
gloves, honey.

1959
01:22:53.755 --> 01:22:56.292
So you want to fight
Sylvester Stallone?

1960
01:22:57.663 --> 01:22:59.330
Can I?

1961
01:22:59.332 --> 01:23:01.267
You do have a case, Mr. Wepner.

1962
01:23:01.269 --> 01:23:03.372
I've been pouring
through the records

1963
01:23:03.374 --> 01:23:05.211
as well as the actual
<i>Rocky films.</i>

1964
01:23:07.449 --> 01:23:09.551
- So we have a case?
- [Anthony] I'd say so.

1965
01:23:09.553 --> 01:23:10.989
I think you got a good one.

1966
01:23:12.392 --> 01:23:13.528
Will you represent me?

1967
01:23:15.231 --> 01:23:17.068
It'd be our privilege to do so.

1968
01:23:18.203 --> 01:23:19.270
But won't he have, like,

1969
01:23:19.272 --> 01:23:20.808
big Hollywood lawyers
who are gonna fight this?

1970
01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:22.380
[Anthony] Yeah, he will.

1971
01:23:23.782 --> 01:23:26.555
- [door opens]
- All right. Buh-bye.

1972
01:23:29.427 --> 01:23:31.095
[Linda] Who was that?

1973
01:23:31.097 --> 01:23:32.400
It was the lawyers.

1974
01:23:33.134 --> 01:23:34.802
What'd they say?

1975
01:23:34.804 --> 01:23:36.272
We're suing Stallone.

1976
01:23:36.274 --> 01:23:37.410
We are?

1977
01:23:38.579 --> 01:23:40.514
Hey, Martin, relax. I got this.

1978
01:23:40.516 --> 01:23:42.250
I'm walking to him right now.

1979
01:23:42.252 --> 01:23:43.488
Yeah, I got this.

1980
01:23:43.490 --> 01:23:44.657
Relax.

1981
01:23:44.659 --> 01:23:45.661
No.

1982
01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:49.535
No.

1983
01:23:52.273 --> 01:23:53.275
No.

1984
01:23:54.645 --> 01:23:56.146
Marty's on the phone.

1985
01:23:56.148 --> 01:23:57.382
Tell him I'll call him back
in an hour.

1986
01:23:57.384 --> 01:23:58.451
I'm about to shoot a scene.

1987
01:23:58.453 --> 01:23:59.620
He says it's important.

1988
01:23:59.622 --> 01:24:00.923
I'll call him back in an hour.

1989
01:24:00.925 --> 01:24:02.361
Talk to Marty.

1990
01:24:07.906 --> 01:24:09.341
Yeah, Marty,
what's so important?

1991
01:24:09.343 --> 01:24:10.745
I'm in the middle of shooting
a scene here.

1992
01:24:12.582 --> 01:24:14.484
Deposition?

1993
01:24:14.486 --> 01:24:15.588
What are you talking about?

1994
01:24:16.724 --> 01:24:19.861
No. No, I'm not doing it.

1995
01:24:19.863 --> 01:24:21.533
What do you mean
I have to do it?

1996
01:24:22.569 --> 01:24:24.171
No, that's ridiculous.

1997
01:24:25.709 --> 01:24:28.246
Look, Marty, it's got no merit.
It's ridiculous.

1998
01:24:29.315 --> 01:24:30.784
You know what,

1999
01:24:30.786 --> 01:24:32.421
Marty, you're the best lawyer
in Hollywood.

2000
01:24:32.423 --> 01:24:34.223
Get it thrown out.

2001
01:24:34.225 --> 01:24:36.261
[Chuck] <i>I was finally ready
to fight for what was mine.</i>

2002
01:24:36.263 --> 01:24:38.667
<i>I didn't want to hurt Stallone,
but I couldn't be broke</i>

2003
01:24:38.669 --> 01:24:41.238
<i>while my life was being lived
out by a bunch of guys</i>

2004
01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:42.474
<i>who made a fortune off me.</i>

2005
01:24:42.476 --> 01:24:45.414
You know, I just want to go
on record here to let you know

2006
01:24:45.416 --> 01:24:48.586
that this whole lawsuit
is an insult. Okay?

2007
01:24:48.588 --> 01:24:50.858
I'm here only because my lawyer
wants me here,

2008
01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:52.495
but I shouldn't even be here.

2009
01:24:52.497 --> 01:24:53.798
So go ahead, ask your questions.

2010
01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:55.368
- Okay.
- All right.

2011
01:24:55.370 --> 01:24:57.739
Let's talk about
what role Chuck Wepner

2012
01:24:57.741 --> 01:24:59.543
played in the <i>Rocky movies.</i>

2013
01:24:59.545 --> 01:25:01.714
What role?
He didn't have a role.

2014
01:25:01.716 --> 01:25:02.816
<i>Rocky was my idea.</i>

2015
01:25:02.818 --> 01:25:04.989
I had it long before
I ever heard of Chuck Wepner.

2016
01:25:05.925 --> 01:25:07.325
He had no role whatsoever.

2017
01:25:07.327 --> 01:25:09.696
He was...
He was inspiration. That's it.

2018
01:25:09.698 --> 01:25:13.404
So you admit that my client
was your inspiration

2019
01:25:13.406 --> 01:25:14.439
for writing this film?

2020
01:25:14.441 --> 01:25:17.713
No, it was inspiring
to watch Wepner fight Ali,

2021
01:25:17.715 --> 01:25:19.315
but he didn't inspire <i>Rocky.</i>

2022
01:25:19.317 --> 01:25:20.753
That's two entirely
different things.

2023
01:25:20.755 --> 01:25:24.560
But you did credit Chuck
publicly on numerous occasions

2024
01:25:24.562 --> 01:25:27.399
with being the inspiration
for <i>Rocky, am I correct?</i>

2025
01:25:27.401 --> 01:25:29.604
It was a marketing thing
for credibility.

2026
01:25:29.606 --> 01:25:30.841
It wasn't a creative thing.

2027
01:25:32.078 --> 01:25:33.011
Look, you know what?

2028
01:25:33.013 --> 01:25:34.447
I don't even know
why we're even in here.

2029
01:25:34.449 --> 01:25:35.516
- You know that?
- Just...

2030
01:25:35.518 --> 01:25:36.584
You're a... You know what?

2031
01:25:36.586 --> 01:25:37.888
- Just answer his question!
- You're a real phony.

2032
01:25:37.890 --> 01:25:39.423
You're a dick.

2033
01:25:39.425 --> 01:25:40.629
- Let's take a break.
- All right.

2034
01:25:42.432 --> 01:25:43.733
She's typing out everything.

2035
01:25:43.735 --> 01:25:44.902
Everything you're saying.

2036
01:25:44.904 --> 01:25:46.004
It's on a transcript, all right?

2037
01:25:46.006 --> 01:25:47.139
Yeah.

2038
01:25:47.141 --> 01:25:48.843
They'll use it against you.
Yes or no.

2039
01:25:48.845 --> 01:25:49.845
What do you think...
Wait a minute, Martin.

2040
01:25:49.847 --> 01:25:52.050
You don't think they're
using it against me now?

2041
01:25:52.052 --> 01:25:54.555
Don't you understand
there's more at stake here?

2042
01:25:54.557 --> 01:25:56.559
Don't you understand
I have a reputation?

2043
01:25:56.561 --> 01:25:57.862
- I have a reputation.
- I'm a star.

2044
01:25:57.864 --> 01:25:58.931
People look at me.

2045
01:25:58.933 --> 01:26:00.133
They also...
They see me as Rocky.

2046
01:26:00.135 --> 01:26:02.470
They don't just see me as Sly
and what they're gonna do

2047
01:26:02.472 --> 01:26:03.941
is they're gonna think
I stole from this guy.

2048
01:26:03.943 --> 01:26:06.479
This guy is stealing from us.
He didn't do anything.

2049
01:26:06.481 --> 01:26:08.684
We don't need Rocky in there.

2050
01:26:08.686 --> 01:26:10.389
- We need me in there.
- It's bigger than that.

2051
01:26:16.134 --> 01:26:17.568
How we doing in there?

2052
01:26:17.570 --> 01:26:19.205
So far, so good.

2053
01:26:19.207 --> 01:26:21.643
He doesn't sound too happy
with me.

2054
01:26:21.645 --> 01:26:23.015
Chuck, that's not your problem.

2055
01:26:24.719 --> 01:26:26.453
I want you to cancel all
our appointments

2056
01:26:26.455 --> 01:26:27.491
for today, all right?

2057
01:26:33.203 --> 01:26:35.705
- You all right?
- Yeah.

2058
01:26:35.707 --> 01:26:37.109
- All right.
- [coughs]

2059
01:26:37.111 --> 01:26:38.413
Let's continue.

2060
01:26:40.751 --> 01:26:44.156
Um, you're aware

2061
01:26:44.158 --> 01:26:48.565
that Chuck wrestled Andre
the Giant in 1976

2062
01:26:48.567 --> 01:26:50.903
- in Shea Stadium, correct?
- Yeah.

2063
01:26:50.905 --> 01:26:52.707
Yeah, everybody knows that.
It was a big deal.

2064
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:55.579
Okay, well, didn't Rocky
wrestle a character

2065
01:26:55.581 --> 01:27:00.189
you called "Thunderlips" played
by Hulk Hogan in <i>Rocky III?</i>

2066
01:27:00.191 --> 01:27:02.126
Oh, you guys
are really bottom feeders.

2067
01:27:02.128 --> 01:27:04.798
Is that where you're going
with this? Really?

2068
01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:07.270
Look, Chuck Wepner had nothing.

2069
01:27:07.272 --> 01:27:10.209
Zero. Not a thing to do
with the creation of <i>Rocky.</i>

2070
01:27:10.211 --> 01:27:11.713
And you want to know the truth?

2071
01:27:11.715 --> 01:27:12.848
<i>Rocky was more based</i>

2072
01:27:12.850 --> 01:27:13.817
on Rocky Marciano,
if you wanna know.

2073
01:27:13.819 --> 01:27:16.589
Okay, but you didn't credit
Rocky Marciano

2074
01:27:16.591 --> 01:27:17.958
as being the inspiration
for <i>Rocky.</i>

2075
01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:19.027
[Sylvester] So what?

2076
01:27:19.029 --> 01:27:21.232
You credit
my client, Chuck Wepner.

2077
01:27:21.234 --> 01:27:22.301
So what?

2078
01:27:22.303 --> 01:27:23.570
Wepner could take a punch.

2079
01:27:23.572 --> 01:27:24.705
So could a million
other fighters.

2080
01:27:24.707 --> 01:27:25.707
What's the big deal?

2081
01:27:25.709 --> 01:27:27.745
But you didn't credit
a million other fighters

2082
01:27:27.747 --> 01:27:28.981
for inspiring <i>Rocky.</i>

2083
01:27:28.983 --> 01:27:32.087
You credit my client,
Chuck Wepner.

2084
01:27:32.089 --> 01:27:33.958
<i>Rocky was my idea!</i>

2085
01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:36.129
I came up with it. Nobody else.

2086
01:27:36.131 --> 01:27:37.632
You know what, you guys
are really something.

2087
01:27:37.634 --> 01:27:38.834
You know that?
You got me in here.

2088
01:27:38.836 --> 01:27:40.237
This is nothing more than
a shakedown.

2089
01:27:40.239 --> 01:27:41.640
You know that?

2090
01:27:41.642 --> 01:27:43.310
Just answer yes.
He's just doing...

2091
01:27:43.312 --> 01:27:46.717
Yeah, but you don't see Ali
suing me over Apollo, do you?

2092
01:27:46.719 --> 01:27:48.254
Look, you know what,
are we done here?

2093
01:27:48.256 --> 01:27:49.790
Are we done? Are you done
with your questions?

2094
01:27:49.792 --> 01:27:50.658
- That's great.
- Okay.

2095
01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:51.528
Okay, that's it,
we're taking a lunch.

2096
01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:53.130
- You know what, I don't want it.
- Okay...

2097
01:27:53.132 --> 01:27:55.036
Ali's lawyer might be
coming to you soon.

2098
01:27:57.375 --> 01:28:00.278
Sly, nothing personal.

2099
01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:02.650
It's no hard feelings.
This is just business.

2100
01:28:02.652 --> 01:28:04.054
[gasping]
You...

2101
01:28:05.223 --> 01:28:06.726
Chuck, you...

2102
01:28:09.132 --> 01:28:11.167
What?

2103
01:28:11.169 --> 01:28:14.908
You play a fighter in the movies
but you ain't no fighter.

2104
01:28:14.910 --> 01:28:17.146
Why don't you do yourself
a favor and go back inside

2105
01:28:17.148 --> 01:28:18.783
before you get hurt?

2106
01:28:18.785 --> 01:28:20.020
[exhales]

2107
01:28:24.797 --> 01:28:26.732
You know something, Chuck?

2108
01:28:26.734 --> 01:28:30.740
This is all a bunch of bullshit
and you know it is.

2109
01:28:30.742 --> 01:28:32.878
So I want you to remember this.

2110
01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:35.018
You can get your lawyers
and you can sue me.

2111
01:28:35.719 --> 01:28:37.754
But in the end,

2112
01:28:37.756 --> 01:28:39.959
it ain't gonna matter
'cause nobody...

2113
01:28:39.961 --> 01:28:42.063
nobody's going to
remember you, Chuck.

2114
01:28:42.065 --> 01:28:43.199
[Sylvester] And me?

2115
01:28:43.201 --> 01:28:45.905
They're gonna remember me
and you want to know why?

2116
01:28:45.907 --> 01:28:47.176
Because I gave them <i>Rocky.</i>

2117
01:28:47.977 --> 01:28:49.879
I gave them a hero.

2118
01:28:49.881 --> 01:28:52.419
I gave them somebody
to look up to.

2119
01:28:52.421 --> 01:28:55.124
What'd you ever give the world,
Chuck, huh?

2120
01:28:55.126 --> 01:28:56.860
What'd you ever give them?

2121
01:28:56.862 --> 01:28:58.230
Nothing.

2122
01:28:58.232 --> 01:29:00.036
Not a goddamn thing.

2123
01:29:15.901 --> 01:29:18.070
- Guess what we just did?
- No, what?

2124
01:29:18.072 --> 01:29:19.374
We just won summary judgment

2125
01:29:19.376 --> 01:29:21.979
against Sylvester
fucking Stallone!

2126
01:29:21.981 --> 01:29:23.081
You're kidding?

2127
01:29:23.083 --> 01:29:24.316
No, I ain't kidding.

2128
01:29:24.318 --> 01:29:26.355
Yeah!
[laughs]

2129
01:29:26.357 --> 01:29:27.557
Yeah!

2130
01:29:27.559 --> 01:29:29.527
[imitating punching]
Out! Out!

2131
01:29:29.529 --> 01:29:31.566
[laughs]
Yeah!

2132
01:29:31.568 --> 01:29:33.036
You the man, Rocco.

2133
01:29:34.105 --> 01:29:35.171
Ching, ching.

2134
01:29:35.173 --> 01:29:36.542
[Chuck] <i>It was the final round.</i>

2135
01:29:36.544 --> 01:29:38.312
<i>Stallone fought hard</i>

2136
01:29:38.314 --> 01:29:40.617
<i>but Mango got me off the ropes
and we stood center ring.</i>

2137
01:29:40.619 --> 01:29:43.122
<i>It all came down to this.</i>

2138
01:29:43.124 --> 01:29:47.096
<i>I needed a knockout to win,
to take my life back.</i>

2139
01:29:47.098 --> 01:29:49.602
<i>I heard the judge told them
to come up with a number.</i>

2140
01:29:49.604 --> 01:29:51.606
<i>Otherwise, if they lost,</i>

2141
01:29:51.608 --> 01:29:55.181
<i>she would and her number
would be a very big one.</i>

2142
01:30:01.629 --> 01:30:03.265
[chuckles]

2143
01:30:31.122 --> 01:30:34.192
<i>And just like that,
down goes Stallone.</i>

2144
01:30:34.194 --> 01:30:35.230
<i>KO.</i>

2145
01:30:36.098 --> 01:30:37.167
[Martin] Well done.

2146
01:30:44.114 --> 01:30:45.150
Whoo!

2147
01:31:03.388 --> 01:31:04.622
[Chuck] <i>I was never</i>

2148
01:31:04.624 --> 01:31:06.425
<i>the heavyweight
champion of the world.</i>

2149
01:31:06.427 --> 01:31:09.699
<i>I was never a movie star
or a billionaire.</i>

2150
01:31:09.701 --> 01:31:12.036
<i>I was just a regular Joe
from Bayonne</i>

2151
01:31:12.038 --> 01:31:14.310
<i>who went the distance
with Ali and Stallone.</i>

2152
01:31:15.646 --> 01:31:18.249
<i>And that was good enough for me.</i>

2153
01:31:18.251 --> 01:31:22.391
<i>Because in the end,
it's all about the ride</i>

2154
01:31:22.393 --> 01:31:26.669
<i>and God knows
I had me one hell of a ride.</i>
