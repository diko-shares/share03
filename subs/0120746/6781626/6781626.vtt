1
00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:42.811
Come on , Alejandro, it is my turn. Let me see.

2
00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:15.761
Hey! What are you doing cutting holes in my wagon?

3
00:02:16.178 --> 00:02:20.557
Sorry, Señor Lopez. We were just waiting for Zorro.

4
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:24.019
-Go home, muchachos.
-Do you think he's going to come?

5
00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.356
Someone thinks he will.

6
00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:34.446
Joaquin , Alejandro, once I carved coffins
for your mother and father.

7
00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:38.617
I would hate to carve ones for you . Now, go!

8
00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:54.883
Alejandro, Joaquin , this is no place for you .
Get back to the mission .

9
00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.956
Come on .

10
00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:51.690
Don Montero, for the love of God , why are you still here?

11
00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:55.110
Now, now, Don Luiz. Calm , calm .

12
00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:59.781
Santa Anna's men are three miles from the town .
You have to go now.

13
00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:04.161
The government of Spain would like to thank you
for your devoted service.

14
00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:15.547
This land is the property of the Spanish government.

15
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.925
In two hours it will be the property of the Mexican government

16
00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.969
unless I hand them over to you .

17
00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:24.431
I am well acquainted with Santa Anna.
He will realize that the dons

18
00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:27.893
will be dutiful taxpayers and he will respect your claims.

19
00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:30.687
The rest of Alta California I have divided equally

20
00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:35.525
among the other dons.
Make sure that all of them receive their grants.

21
00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:44.409
Get the children out of the plaza immediately.

22
00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:50.624
The children should never have to see the things we do.

23
00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:55.212
I want to see! Put me down .

24
00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:04.763
Zorro?

25
00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:15.690
I saw him. I saw Zorro. Come on .

26
00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:32.207
Who are these men that you would risk your life
to have killed?

27
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.584
Who are they? No idea.

28
00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:37.045
Three peasants pulled at random from the crowd .

29
00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:54.187
Where is he?

30
00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:14.332
Go.

31
00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:57.626
Come on .

32
00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:42.462
My thanks to you , gentlemen .

33
00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:53.473
Now, if you will excuse me, I'm missing my own party.

34
00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:12.242
Kill him !

35
00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:22.961
Zorro, Zorro, Zorro!

36
00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:27.257
Zorro!

37
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:36.808
You would murder three innocent men to capture me?

38
00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:40.478
I would murder 100 innocent men if it meant killing you .

39
00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:49.904
Three men , three cuts. A small memento of Mexico, Rafael .

40
00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:52.198
To remind you not to return .

41
00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:38.680
Tornado, my old friend , you're getting too old for this.

42
00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:42.100
Yes, me too.

43
00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:10.003
Is she warm enough?

44
00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:13.673
I always put on an extra blanket for you , señor.

45
00:11:50.668 --> 00:11:53.796
But the good prince was not afraid of the evil king.

46
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.633
He raced across the drawbridge, fighting off 100 guards.

47
00:11:56.716 --> 00:12:00.720
And then , looking very handsome and dashing
in the late-afternoon sun ,

48
00:12:00.803 --> 00:12:04.349
he leapt onto the balcony and thrust his enchanted sword

49
00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:05.767
under the king's chin.

50
00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:11.272
"You would kill three innocent men just to capture me?"

51
00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:12.941
"Yes."

52
00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:19.280
Then suddenly lightning flashed
and thunder shocked the wasted land .

53
00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:24.244
The evil king glared at the good prince and said ...

54
00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:29.123
Something very forgettable.

55
00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:31.834
And the good prince, what did he do?

56
00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:38.007
Well , he leapt from the balcony
onto his faithful old steed , Tornado,

57
00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:41.552
and raced home to his beautiful wife, Esperanza,

58
00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:44.264
and to his little child , Elena.

59
00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:48.559
Never to do anything so foolish or dangerous again .

60
00:12:49.018 --> 00:12:51.771
She loves to hear your stories.

61
00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:56.150
It's only the sound of my voice.

62
00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:58.611
One day she'll have no time for them .

63
00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:02.532
I never tire of them. Why should she?

64
00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:11.749
Esperanza...

65
00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:21.092
She already has your strength .

66
00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:24.637
Today she broke the little clay horse you made for her.

67
00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:27.140
Diego.

68
00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:29.559
It's just a scratch .

69
00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.978
Diego, you promised me.

70
00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:36.024
No more nights waiting up, praying you come home alive.

71
00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:41.195
The Spaniards are going home. Today is Zorro's last ride.

72
00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:46.534
From now on , we'll grow old together with our five children .

73
00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:50.788
-Five?
-Yeah . Not enough?

74
00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:53.541
I love you .

75
00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:09.640
Doña de Ia Vega, still as beautiful as ever.

76
00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:15.938
Don Rafael , what an honor. The governor in my home.

77
00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:21.527
-You'll stay for dinner, of course.
-I have come to apologize, Esperanza.

78
00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:26.532
I'm sorry that I could not protect this country
from the peasants.

79
00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:29.494
I'm sorry that I couldn't make you love me.

80
00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:33.456
And I'm sorry that I have to leave you without a husband .

81
00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.583
Arrest him.

82
00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:56.938
Blood never lies. . . Zorro.

83
00:14:58.022 --> 00:15:03.569
You're a traitor to your country and your class.
Take him away.

84
00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:11.160
Wait!

85
00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:50.825
-No!
-No!

86
00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:12.388
I would never have let any harm come to her.

87
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.142
She was never yours to protect.

88
00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:21.522
Elena.

89
00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:34.785
I want you to live with the knowledge

90
00:16:34.869 --> 00:16:37.330
that you have lost everything that you hold dear.

91
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.502
I want you to suffer as I have suffered ,

92
00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:45.755
knowing that your child should have been mine.

93
00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:07.610
Elena! Elena!

94
00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:25.253
Let me hold her.

95
00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:28.214
Let me hold her!

96
00:17:29.173 --> 00:17:30.216
Rafael !

97
00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:33.553
She has her mother's eyes.

98
00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:49.026
Rafael ! You'll never be rid of me!

99
00:18:24.687 --> 00:18:28.733
Stayed on their track
Bringing them back

100
00:18:28.816 --> 00:18:34.030
So pay the bounty now to me
'Cause...

101
00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.746
'Cause ?

102
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:45.374
-Nobody’s tough as Jack
-Nobody’s tough as Jack

103
00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:48.044
-Nobody's tough as Jack
-Nobody's tough as Jack

104
00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:52.840
Now you're getting there. Like I done told you ,

105
00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:55.926
singing can lighten your terrible load .

106
00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:18.366
Hey, hey, hey!

107
00:19:18.449 --> 00:19:23.621
Come one, come all, for the fright of your life!

108
00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:30.044
See the notorious Murrieta brothers! Robbers, horse thieves,

109
00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:36.300
bandits, people of the worst sort. Hey! Get out here.

110
00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:43.015
Garcia. The Murrieta brothers.

111
00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:50.773
Get over here, you stinking trash.

112
00:20:01.784 --> 00:20:05.162
These men are now in the custody
of Corporal Armando Garcia.

113
00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:07.331
We will take them the rest of the way.

114
00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:12.211
-Claim your bounty in Tlaxco.
-When bulls start wearing bloomers.

115
00:20:12.294 --> 00:20:14.296
How much are we worth?

116
00:20:15.172 --> 00:20:20.594
All figured , about 200 pesos.

117
00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:26.267
Two hundred pesos? That's it? A lousy 200 pesos apiece?

118
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:30.646
-We're wasting time.
-That's 200 for the both of you .

119
00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:34.525
What? Are you crazy? Don't take it, Jack.

120
00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:40.906
Touch my brother again and I'll kill you .

121
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.199
Yes, he will .

122
00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:48.080
Hey, I thought you were tied up.

123
00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:51.250
That's because you're stupid .

124
00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.090
Drop it! Drop it!

125
00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:04.180
Hey.

126
00:21:06.223 --> 00:21:11.270
-They got a strongbox on the wagon .
-We know. That's why we came.

127
00:21:15.858 --> 00:21:20.488
It is a fact that I , the legendary Three-Fingered Jack,

128
00:21:20.571 --> 00:21:23.741
ain't even mentioned . I ain't even mentioned .

129
00:21:23.824 --> 00:21:29.079
Ain't I the one that figured to kidnap
the mayor from his own outhouse?

130
00:21:29.163 --> 00:21:33.417
I tell you , I am the holy guts of this gang .

131
00:21:33.501 --> 00:21:37.004
Without me, the whole dang opera falls apart.

132
00:22:26.512 --> 00:22:28.556
Go! Go.

133
00:22:28.639 --> 00:22:30.724
Come on . Get up, get up!

134
00:22:34.979 --> 00:22:36.564
Go.

135
00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:39.400
Go.

136
00:23:00.796 --> 00:23:05.009
I want you to know, I consider this an honor.

137
00:23:38.334 --> 00:23:42.046
Bury the body. Bag the head .

138
00:24:42.898 --> 00:24:45.609
Of course I have feelings for you .

139
00:24:46.026 --> 00:24:51.865
Yes, yes, but quick. Hide in the barn .

140
00:24:52.241 --> 00:24:54.118
He's coming .

141
00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:02.209
What do you want?! Please, don't touch me.

142
00:25:02.292 --> 00:25:04.962
What do you want? Who are you?

143
00:25:11.885 --> 00:25:14.388
Don Rafael .

144
00:26:08.025 --> 00:26:09.193
Listen to me.

145
00:26:10.778 --> 00:26:13.864
If any of you is, or ever was,

146
00:26:13.947 --> 00:26:17.951
that masked man all dressed in black known as Zorro,

147
00:26:18.494 --> 00:26:20.871
reveal himself now.

148
00:26:21.705 --> 00:26:23.540
I'm Zorro!

149
00:26:24.875 --> 00:26:30.047
-They took my mask, my sword--
-Silence, you old fool !

150
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:35.094
-I am Zorro! I am the man you want. I am the original--
-Liar!

151
00:26:35.177 --> 00:26:39.932
Liar! Anyone can see you are too tall .

152
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:29.690
Get him out of here before he starts to stink.

153
00:27:47.457 --> 00:27:49.251
Did you find him?

154
00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.590
He's dead .

155
00:27:55.841 --> 00:27:59.094
Back to the boat.
I need some sleep before landing tomorrow.

156
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.869
The governor has returned !

157
00:29:57.587 --> 00:29:58.672
Luiz.

158
00:30:00.048 --> 00:30:03.093
Welcome home, Rafael. It has been too long.

159
00:30:03.802 --> 00:30:05.387
Too long , my friend .

160
00:30:05.887 --> 00:30:09.349
You said once you favored me above all .

161
00:30:09.433 --> 00:30:13.520
Consider this a fool's apology for ever doubting you .

162
00:30:19.693 --> 00:30:24.197
Come. A crowd has gathered to greet you .

163
00:30:28.577 --> 00:30:31.330
-Don Pedro.
-Don Rafael , welcome.

164
00:30:31.413 --> 00:30:33.206
-You're looking well .
-Thank you .

165
00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:34.958
-Don Hector.
-Welcome back, sir.

166
00:30:35.042 --> 00:30:36.918
Don Julio.

167
00:30:38.462 --> 00:30:40.255
Gentlemen .

168
00:30:47.054 --> 00:30:49.973
Please, please.

169
00:30:50.974 --> 00:30:54.061
I know you are not really happy to see me,

170
00:30:54.144 --> 00:30:57.606
so let us all stop pretending, shall we?

171
00:30:58.065 --> 00:31:00.942
You think I don't know that you have been paid ,

172
00:31:01.026 --> 00:31:04.529
even threatened, to come out in the hot sun and greet me?

173
00:31:05.405 --> 00:31:09.159
I understand exactly how you feel .

174
00:31:09.576 --> 00:31:14.164
Why should you care about any of your leaders,
past or present?

175
00:31:14.247 --> 00:31:16.458
What did they ever do for you?

176
00:31:17.042 --> 00:31:20.837
The Spaniards oppressed you, the Mexicans ignored you .

177
00:31:20.921 --> 00:31:24.883
And the dons? Well , the dons, the dons...

178
00:31:24.966 --> 00:31:29.888
The dons seem merely content to cheat and lie to you .

179
00:31:32.224 --> 00:31:36.978
In fact, I put it to you .
Who, in your entire history, has ever helped you?

180
00:31:37.062 --> 00:31:41.233
Zorro! Zorro fought for the people.

181
00:31:46.363 --> 00:31:48.532
Yes, Zorro.

182
00:31:49.408 --> 00:31:53.829
Where is he now, Padre, your masked friend?

183
00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:57.749
Unless I am mistaken, he hasn't shown himself in 20 years.

184
00:31:57.833 --> 00:32:00.293
Twenty years!

185
00:32:01.169 --> 00:32:03.505
People of California,

186
00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:07.217
the time has come to take our destiny into our own hands.

187
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:13.223
Not as Spaniards, not as Mexicans, but as Californians!

188
00:32:19.521 --> 00:32:23.942
I stand here before you today with no mask.

189
00:32:24.317 --> 00:32:30.365
Only a pledge, a solemn pledge
that I will never abandon you!

190
00:32:30.449 --> 00:32:34.327
And you have my word, the word of Rafael Montero,

191
00:32:34.411 --> 00:32:37.747
that I will do everything within my power to help you fight

192
00:32:37.831 --> 00:32:40.959
for a free and independent California!

193
00:32:51.845 --> 00:32:53.555
Father.

194
00:32:59.019 --> 00:33:03.064
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce my daughter, Elena.

195
00:33:10.447 --> 00:33:12.282
Thank you.

196
00:33:14.493 --> 00:33:17.579
Can anyone tell me what this flower is? I know this scent.

197
00:33:18.955 --> 00:33:20.540
It's called romneya.

198
00:33:20.624 --> 00:33:22.417
But it only grows in California,

199
00:33:22.501 --> 00:33:25.462
and I believe this is your first visit to our shores.

200
00:33:25.545 --> 00:33:27.255
Yes.

201
00:33:55.158 --> 00:33:58.912
Hey, hey, hey. More whiskey.

202
00:34:00.205 --> 00:34:04.251
Or whatever you call this.
I don't want to see the bottom of this glass.

203
00:34:04.334 --> 00:34:05.752
Money first.

204
00:34:05.835 --> 00:34:07.671
Money first.

205
00:34:09.047 --> 00:34:11.800
Hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait!

206
00:34:14.386 --> 00:34:17.514
-What about this?
-SilVer!

207
00:34:18.682 --> 00:34:21.643
Of course, silver. The finest.

208
00:34:28.275 --> 00:34:31.820
-Where did you get that?
-It's none of your business.

209
00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:35.031
Where did you get it?

210
00:34:38.118 --> 00:34:40.203
It was my brother's.

211
00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:43.081
He's dead.

212
00:34:45.667 --> 00:34:49.129
-I'm sorry.
-You're sorry?

213
00:34:49.212 --> 00:34:51.548
Why should you be sorry?

214
00:34:53.133 --> 00:34:56.303
You should not trade it for a mere glass of whiskey.

215
00:34:56.386 --> 00:35:00.307
Why not? You think I could get two?

216
00:35:07.397 --> 00:35:09.232
Who is that?

217
00:35:13.862 --> 00:35:16.656
-The man who killed my brother.
-You're drunk and angry,

218
00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.701
in no condition to fight a professional soldier.

219
00:35:20.201 --> 00:35:22.829
Get out of my way, old man.

220
00:35:52.734 --> 00:35:55.028
Would you care to try again?

221
00:35:56.363 --> 00:35:57.530
You're welcome.

222
00:36:00.492 --> 00:36:03.912
-For what?
-For saving your life.

223
00:36:08.249 --> 00:36:12.879
-I would have killed him.
-No, not today. He is trained to kill.

224
00:36:12.962 --> 00:36:14.798
You seem trained to drink.

225
00:36:14.881 --> 00:36:18.051
You would have fought Very bravely and died very quickly.

226
00:36:18.134 --> 00:36:20.470
Who then would avenge your brother?

227
00:36:22.263 --> 00:36:24.432
I would have found a way.

228
00:36:25.058 --> 00:36:28.478
-I've never lost a fight.
-Except to a crippled old man just now.

229
00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:33.650
-What is your name?
-Alejandro.

230
00:36:33.733 --> 00:36:35.652
Alejandro.

231
00:36:37.987 --> 00:36:40.407
You know, there is a very old saying:

232
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:42.992
"When the pupil is ready, the master will appear."

233
00:36:43.076 --> 00:36:45.829
If you want to kill this man, I can teach you how.

234
00:36:45.912 --> 00:36:48.915
How to move, how to think,
how to take your revenge with honor.

235
00:36:48.998 --> 00:36:53.128
And live to celebrate it. It will take dedication and time.

236
00:36:54.295 --> 00:36:56.131
Why are you so eager to help me?

237
00:36:56.673 --> 00:36:58.550
Because once, a long time ago,

238
00:37:02.387 --> 00:37:04.305
you did the same for me.

239
00:37:15.108 --> 00:37:17.193
I can't believe it.

240
00:37:18.194 --> 00:37:24.409
I never thought that, one day,
I would be standing in the lair of the fox.

241
00:37:24.492 --> 00:37:26.035
In the lair of Zorro.

242
00:37:28.288 --> 00:37:31.958
This place was devoted to the training of Zorro.

243
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:37.756
Where were you all these years? I thought you were dead.

244
00:37:38.965 --> 00:37:43.845
I was dead. And we will leave it at that.

245
00:37:50.602 --> 00:37:56.191
I remember the last time I saw you.
You were fighting a hundred men.

246
00:37:56.274 --> 00:37:58.067
-A hundred men?
-I do not forget.

247
00:37:58.151 --> 00:38:02.489
You were the greatest swordsman who ever lived. Yes.

248
00:38:02.572 --> 00:38:06.201
Rafael Montero was the governor of California then.

249
00:38:06.284 --> 00:38:08.411
Do you remember him?

250
00:38:09.871 --> 00:38:11.372
What?

251
00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.209
Rafael Montero. Do you remember him?

252
00:38:16.169 --> 00:38:19.923
Yes. His soldiers killed many.

253
00:38:20.006 --> 00:38:24.761
And he was the sworn enemy of Zorro. You.

254
00:38:26.012 --> 00:38:29.682
-Montero has come back.
-Good. Then you can kill him.

255
00:38:29.766 --> 00:38:34.229
No, there are too many complications for me to ignore.

256
00:38:35.772 --> 00:38:37.774
What complications?

257
00:38:44.405 --> 00:38:47.659
I can see we are not gonna spend much time talking.

258
00:38:49.118 --> 00:38:52.664
Montero has some design for California,

259
00:38:52.747 --> 00:38:56.668
otherwise he would not have retained
the services of Captain Love.

260
00:38:56.751 --> 00:38:59.921
-We must find out what that is.
-And then what?

261
00:39:01.297 --> 00:39:05.176
If you are ready, we will both tempt our fates.

262
00:39:06.386 --> 00:39:08.304
Let's go, then.

263
00:39:12.475 --> 00:39:15.019
Do you know how to use that thing?

264
00:39:15.103 --> 00:39:18.189
Yes. The pointy end goes into the other man.

265
00:39:22.944 --> 00:39:25.113
This is going to take a lot of work.

266
00:39:27.156 --> 00:39:30.952
This is called a training circle. The master's wheel.

267
00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:35.248
This circle will be your world, your whole life.

268
00:39:35.331 --> 00:39:38.501
Till I tell you otherwise, there is nothing outside of it.

269
00:39:38.585 --> 00:39:43.006
-Captain Love--
-There is nothing outside of it.

270
00:39:43.089 --> 00:39:47.010
Captain Love does not exist until I say he exists.

271
00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:58.229
As your skill improves, you will progress to a smaller circle.

272
00:39:58.313 --> 00:40:02.025
Each new circle brings you
that much closer to your adversary.

273
00:40:02.108 --> 00:40:04.068
That much closer to retribution.

274
00:40:05.737 --> 00:40:09.949
-I like that part.
-Shall we?

275
00:40:30.929 --> 00:40:35.892
Slow. Attack slow. Attack.

276
00:40:35.975 --> 00:40:38.978
Slow. Again. Slow.

277
00:40:39.062 --> 00:40:43.691
First triangle. Slowly. Good!

278
00:40:43.775 --> 00:40:47.362
-Good. That is good.
-Thank you.

279
00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:49.113
Attack.

280
00:40:52.575 --> 00:40:54.160
Good!

281
00:40:55.912 --> 00:40:56.996
Time for a drink.

282
00:41:10.009 --> 00:41:12.345
Perfect. Do it again.

283
00:41:29.737 --> 00:41:31.906
One, five, three!

284
00:41:33.408 --> 00:41:35.410
Six, four, two!

285
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:38.162
And lunge!

286
00:41:38.496 --> 00:41:40.415
Over-lunge!

287
00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:53.177
Lesson number one: Never attack in anger.

288
00:41:58.182 --> 00:42:00.309
Lesson number two:

289
00:42:01.477 --> 00:42:03.354
Come with me.

290
00:42:06.149 --> 00:42:07.400
What?

291
00:42:20.997 --> 00:42:25.668
-So, what is lesson number three?
-To get to lesson number four.

292
00:42:47.148 --> 00:42:48.649
Again?

293
00:43:11.214 --> 00:43:16.677
-Black Andalusian. Magnificent.
-It looks like your old horse, Tornado.

294
00:43:52.839 --> 00:43:55.800
Hey, hey, hey.

295
00:43:55.883 --> 00:43:57.677
Quiet, quiet.

296
00:44:08.938 --> 00:44:14.110
Damned horse! What are you doing?
What are you doing?!

297
00:44:16.404 --> 00:44:17.989
I'll see you tonight.

298
00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:43.681
Zorro, you look better than ever.

299
00:45:10.082 --> 00:45:14.128
Be careful, señorita, there are dangerous men about.

300
00:45:14.921 --> 00:45:20.051
Well, if you see any, be sure to point them out.

301
00:46:35.334 --> 00:46:39.839
Listen, I'm going to give you the great honor

302
00:46:39.922 --> 00:46:42.216
of being my horse.

303
00:46:59.692 --> 00:47:03.487
We are like one spirit.

304
00:47:08.451 --> 00:47:11.245
Damn it! Stop!

305
00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:10.137
Go, go, go!

306
00:48:41.544 --> 00:48:44.046
Get him!

307
00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:44.416
Kill him.

308
00:51:20.536 --> 00:51:24.957
Zorro! The legend has returned!

309
00:52:04.371 --> 00:52:06.206
Don't yell.

310
00:52:09.251 --> 00:52:11.420
I need sanctuary, Father. You don't know me--

311
00:52:11.503 --> 00:52:14.048
Zorro! Of course I know you.

312
00:52:14.131 --> 00:52:19.178
Zorro, is it really you?
The years have been kinder to you than to me.

313
00:52:19.261 --> 00:52:24.933
I have no time to talk now. Father, please, hide me.

314
00:52:25.267 --> 00:52:26.769
Come.

315
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:33.609
It's just like the old days.

316
00:52:41.617 --> 00:52:43.702
Padre, is that you?

317
00:52:44.912 --> 00:52:48.457
Is everything all right?
It sounds like there is a battle going on.

318
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:54.922
Don't worry, my dear. You are safe in the house of the Lord.

319
00:52:55.005 --> 00:52:59.426
Of course, Padre. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

320
00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:01.637
It has been three days since my last confession.

321
00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:04.848
How many sins could you have committed in three days?

322
00:53:04.932 --> 00:53:07.643
Come back when you have more time, please.

323
00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:13.107
-Excuse me?
-Listen, señorita.

324
00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:19.321
Please, go on.

325
00:53:20.447 --> 00:53:24.785
-I broke the Fourth Commandment.
-You killed somebody?

326
00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:30.374
-That's not the Fourth Commandment.
-Of course not.

327
00:53:31.583 --> 00:53:37.256
In what way did you break
the most sacred of Commandments?

328
00:53:37.339 --> 00:53:39.133
I dishonored my father.

329
00:53:40.843 --> 00:53:44.263
That is not so bad. Maybe your father deserved it.

330
00:53:44.346 --> 00:53:50.853
-What did you say?
-I said, tell me more, my child.

331
00:53:51.645 --> 00:53:56.150
Well, I try to behave properly,
the way my father would like me to.

332
00:53:56.233 --> 00:54:00.571
-But I'm afraid my heart is too wild.
-Too wild?

333
00:54:00.654 --> 00:54:05.534
-Yes.
-Could you be more specific?

334
00:54:05.617 --> 00:54:08.245
I had impure thoughts about a man.

335
00:54:08.328 --> 00:54:12.791
I did. I think he was a bandit or something.
He wore a black mask.

336
00:54:15.335 --> 00:54:20.758
-He had a deep voice?
-Yes.

337
00:54:21.675 --> 00:54:27.222
-Ruggedly handsome?
-His face was half-covered.

338
00:54:28.015 --> 00:54:31.059
But something in his eyes captured me.

339
00:54:31.518 --> 00:54:32.686
Captured you.

340
00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:37.191
I felt warm and feverish.

341
00:54:37.983 --> 00:54:39.860
Lustful?

342
00:54:42.654 --> 00:54:44.281
Yes, lustful.

343
00:54:48.076 --> 00:54:49.453
Forgive me.

344
00:54:54.249 --> 00:54:56.126
I forgive you.

345
00:55:00.255 --> 00:55:02.883
Look over there, by the altar!

346
00:55:03.634 --> 00:55:05.177
He won't get away!

347
00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:10.724
Search everything. The chapel, the loft, the rectory, all of it.

348
00:55:10.808 --> 00:55:13.560
This is a house of God.

349
00:55:14.061 --> 00:55:17.564
Don't worry, Padre, we'll be gone by the time he gets back.

350
00:55:19.817 --> 00:55:23.612
Señorita, you have done nothing wrong.

351
00:55:23.695 --> 00:55:28.408
The only sin would be to deny what your heart truly feels.

352
00:55:29.451 --> 00:55:31.286
Now, go.

353
00:55:34.498 --> 00:55:36.208
Elena!

354
00:55:41.338 --> 00:55:44.424
-What are you doing here?
-I was confessing.

355
00:55:44.508 --> 00:55:46.802
-Confessing?
-Yes.

356
00:55:47.427 --> 00:55:49.805
To whom? The priest is here.

357
00:55:53.267 --> 00:55:57.312
Stand back, Elena. Please.

358
00:56:15.747 --> 00:56:21.086
Out of respect for Miss Montero, I'll deal with you later.

359
00:56:29.052 --> 00:56:31.805
Horse! Come here.

360
00:56:37.352 --> 00:56:41.940
Blackie! Thunder! Storm!

361
00:56:42.024 --> 00:56:44.318
Stupido! Get over here now!

362
00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:50.365
I warn you. I'll get another horse.

363
00:58:00.227 --> 00:58:01.853
So?

364
00:58:02.646 --> 00:58:04.523
What do you think?

365
00:58:08.568 --> 00:58:14.491
Sir, I got the black stallion, I carved a "Z" in the--

366
00:58:16.618 --> 00:58:19.663
The people will be speaking the name of Zorro again.

367
00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:25.002
You think stealing a horse makes you
worthy enough to wear that mask?

368
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:29.214
Be careful.

369
00:58:33.135 --> 00:58:37.723
You're a thief, Alejandro. A pitiful clown.

370
00:58:38.181 --> 00:58:41.977
Zorro was a servant of the people,
not a seeker of fame like you.

371
00:58:43.562 --> 00:58:44.771
A buffoon.

372
00:58:47.607 --> 00:58:51.028
-Zorro did what was needed.
-Now he's needed again.

373
00:58:53.613 --> 00:58:56.158
I didn't ask for your help in the cantina,

374
00:58:56.241 --> 00:59:00.579
but I came here to learn how to fight like you.

375
00:59:00.662 --> 00:59:03.415
To have your strength, your courage.

376
00:59:04.291 --> 00:59:07.586
Now when I try to use them, you slap me down?

377
00:59:08.879 --> 00:59:14.176
Let me tell you something.
I am tired of all your training, your lecturing.

378
00:59:14.259 --> 00:59:18.638
I am tired of waiting for you to tell me I am ready.

379
00:59:19.264 --> 00:59:24.811
I have my own scores to settle, a new life to find.

380
00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:30.567
I thought I could do it here, but I was wrong.

381
00:59:31.735 --> 00:59:33.653
Alejandro!

382
00:59:34.613 --> 00:59:36.615
En garde!

383
00:59:40.577 --> 00:59:41.787
Choose your weapon.

384
01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:06.728
Montero has invited every don in California to a banquet.

385
01:00:07.312 --> 01:00:11.566
If you want to be of service, you can join them as a spy.

386
01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:15.612
I think I do not understand, sir.

387
01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:20.325
You have passion, Alejandro, and your skill is growing.

388
01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:24.788
But to enter Montero's world,
I must give you something which is beyond your reach.

389
01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:29.668
-Yes? What is that?
-Charm.

390
01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:32.879
And what is that?

391
01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:40.262
Convince Montero that you're a gentleman of stature

392
01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:42.264
and he will let you into his circle.

393
01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:47.978
Me?

394
01:00:49.396 --> 01:00:51.189
A gentleman?

395
01:00:53.733 --> 01:00:55.652
This is gonna take a lot of work.

396
01:00:57.571 --> 01:00:59.447
Yes.

397
01:01:17.966 --> 01:01:20.969
Look at me. I look like a butterfly.

398
01:01:21.052 --> 01:01:23.346
This is the most stupid thing I've ever done.

399
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:26.141
-I doubt that.
-We'll never get away with this.

400
01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:28.101
Yes, we will.

401
01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:33.481
A nobleman is a man who says one thing and thinks another.

402
01:01:33.565 --> 01:01:35.650
What if Montero realizes who you are?

403
01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:38.653
Montero thinks of himself as a true nobleman.

404
01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:43.491
He will never look a servant in the eye. Listen to me.

405
01:01:43.575 --> 01:01:45.577
Listen to me!

406
01:01:48.205 --> 01:01:50.332
Most important thing of all,

407
01:01:50.415 --> 01:01:53.335
do not let the dons leave the table without you.

408
01:01:53.418 --> 01:01:55.212
Yes, sir.

409
01:01:56.379 --> 01:02:00.675
-Good luck tonight.
-Thank you.

410
01:02:00.759 --> 01:02:05.013
Stand up straight. Charm.

411
01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:07.140
Charm.

412
01:02:24.866 --> 01:02:28.536
Don Rafael Montero? Good evening.

413
01:02:28.995 --> 01:02:31.581
I am Don Alejandro del Castillo y Garcia.

414
01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:36.419
The formal Spanish greeting. I have not seen that in years.

415
01:02:37.337 --> 01:02:41.508
-My father was very strict.
-Who is your father?

416
01:02:41.925 --> 01:02:43.551
Don Bartolo del Castillo.

417
01:02:44.803 --> 01:02:47.847
I have heard of him,
but never had the pleasure of meeting him.

418
01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:54.062
I arrived last week from Spain,
by way of Paris, Lisbon and San Francisco.

419
01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:57.315
I am inspecting my family's holdings.

420
01:03:02.404 --> 01:03:05.865
Queen Isabella of Spain has been very generous to us.

421
01:03:08.243 --> 01:03:11.705
Very impressive. What brings you here?

422
01:03:12.414 --> 01:03:16.459
I heard you were back in California
and knew I must introduce myself.

423
01:03:16.543 --> 01:03:19.004
Her Royal Highness speaks very highly of you.

424
01:03:21.548 --> 01:03:23.091
Really?

425
01:03:23.675 --> 01:03:28.805
I thought I fell out of favor with the court
when California was lost.

426
01:03:35.186 --> 01:03:37.856
Only in certain circles.

427
01:03:37.939 --> 01:03:42.610
Her Majesty knows those unfortunate events
were clearly no fault of yours.

428
01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:48.742
She told me this is still a land of opportunity
for a man of vision.

429
01:03:49.117 --> 01:03:55.248
-And you are a man of vision?
-I am a man in search of a vision.

430
01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:02.339
But my timing is unfortunate. I have interrupted a party.

431
01:04:02.422 --> 01:04:04.382
Perhaps I could call again?

432
01:04:05.967 --> 01:04:08.845
No, it would honor me for you to join us.

433
01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:12.057
No, it would honor me to do so, sir.

434
01:04:12.974 --> 01:04:16.686
-Please allow me to introduce my daughter, Elena.
-Of course.

435
01:04:20.982 --> 01:04:22.650
Charmed.

436
01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:29.824
I'm afraid I have brought no gift for the hostess,

437
01:04:29.908 --> 01:04:33.203
but wait a moment.

438
01:04:44.839 --> 01:04:47.634
-Thank you.
-A pleasure.

439
01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:57.811
Bernardo, pick up your feet. Señorita. Caballero.

440
01:05:22.544 --> 01:05:23.628
Don Alejandro.

441
01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:28.591
My father and I would like you to join us at our table.

442
01:05:29.634 --> 01:05:32.387
I would be delighted, señorita.

443
01:05:45.483 --> 01:05:48.236
Don Alejandro, I'm so pleased you could join us.

444
01:05:48.319 --> 01:05:52.031
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce
Don Alejandro del Castillo y Garcia.

445
01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:54.742
Recently returned from Spain.

446
01:05:54.826 --> 01:06:01.207
This is Captain Harrison Love. Not a don, but a kindred spirit.

447
01:06:02.667 --> 01:06:06.588
Are you not the man who was chasing
a legendary bandit recently?

448
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:09.966
-He was hardly legendary.
-So you caught him?

449
01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:17.265
-It's only a matter of time.
-The bandit may have escaped,

450
01:06:17.348 --> 01:06:22.353
but the rest of us will think twice before going to confession.

451
01:06:46.377 --> 01:06:48.129
Thank you.

452
01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:53.760
With all due respect, Don Hector, I disagree.

453
01:06:54.469 --> 01:06:56.971
Until these people are free to govern themselves,

454
01:06:57.055 --> 01:07:00.642
I think we will see many more Z's carved into walls.

455
01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:04.145
Don Alejandro, what do you think?

456
01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:11.402
I think. . . sheep will always need a shepherd.

457
01:07:11.819 --> 01:07:16.824
But certainly not this Zorro creature.

458
01:07:16.908 --> 01:07:22.205
He probably wears the mask to hide
his bald head and unsightly features.

459
01:07:25.625 --> 01:07:30.421
-Some would call him heroic.
-Heroism, a romantic illusion.

460
01:07:30.505 --> 01:07:32.966
-Much like nobility.
-Elena, that is enough.

461
01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:37.887
I would think heroism is something to aspire to, not sneer at.

462
01:07:38.263 --> 01:07:42.850
All that playing swords, shooting guns,
racing around on horses...

463
01:07:42.934 --> 01:07:44.644
gives me a frightful headache.

464
01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:48.731
Such sweaty pursuits are hardly the work of a gentleman.

465
01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:51.901
And what is? Climbing in and out of carriages?

466
01:07:52.318 --> 01:07:53.903
No, my dear.

467
01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:59.325
But increasing one's holdings
so as to provide lavish comfort for ladies.

468
01:07:59.784 --> 01:08:00.827
Such as yourself.

469
01:08:08.459 --> 01:08:11.212
A woman's grasp of politics. What can I say?

470
01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:20.930
We're at a party, aren't we?
May I have the honor of this dance?

471
01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:25.602
I would be glad to.

472
01:09:13.775 --> 01:09:16.611
Yes? Were you looking for something?

473
01:09:17.236 --> 01:09:20.323
A sense of the miraculous in everyday life.

474
01:09:21.574 --> 01:09:26.746
Really? Look some place else.
The lady and I were trying to dance.

475
01:09:26.829 --> 01:09:30.249
You were trying. She was succeeding.

476
01:09:32.418 --> 01:09:36.589
Forgive me, captain. A shameless joke at your expense.

477
01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:42.512
I hope it will not be the last.
Don Rafael wants you back. Now.

478
01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:34.021
Should we try something more robust,
or do you feel unequal to the task?

479
01:10:34.105 --> 01:10:36.482
No, on the contrary.

480
01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:40.611
I think only of your distaste for perspiration.

481
01:10:41.612 --> 01:10:43.197
Maestro.

482
01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:13.371
Well, that is the way they are dancing in Madrid these days.

483
01:12:13.454 --> 01:12:16.541
Excuse me, Don Rafael, I need to catch my breath.

484
01:12:16.624 --> 01:12:19.794
Your daughter is a very spirited dancer.

485
01:12:19.877 --> 01:12:24.590
"Spirited." Thank you for putting it so delicately.

486
01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:31.180
I apologize if you're offended.

487
01:12:31.264 --> 01:12:34.892
No, no, no. Completely unnecessary, I assure you.

488
01:12:34.976 --> 01:12:39.188
She is young and impulsive,
but her beauty is beyond compare.

489
01:12:39.272 --> 01:12:42.859
And she has her father's commanding presence.

490
01:12:45.069 --> 01:12:46.779
Don Rafael.

491
01:12:50.658 --> 01:12:55.037
As an advisor to Her Royal Highness in matters of finance,

492
01:12:55.121 --> 01:12:59.375
it would be my pleasure to introduce you both at court.

493
01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:12.722
Join us in the courtyard.
There's something I want to share with you.

494
01:13:13.431 --> 01:13:15.141
What is that?

495
01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:16.517
A vision.

496
01:13:27.028 --> 01:13:29.864
Fellow dons of California,

497
01:13:29.947 --> 01:13:34.660
all of us can recall the golden years
when we ruled this country.

498
01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:39.582
We commanded respect
and amassed a great deal of wealth.

499
01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:42.209
But there was something that we never achieved.

500
01:13:42.293 --> 01:13:45.796
We never determined our own destiny.

501
01:13:47.131 --> 01:13:53.512
Well, the time has come to claim
what always should have been ours.

502
01:13:53.888 --> 01:13:54.889
My friends,

503
01:13:56.432 --> 01:14:02.688
I give you the independent Republic of California.

504
01:14:17.536 --> 01:14:21.415
Don Rafael, every man here owes you something.

505
01:14:21.707 --> 01:14:24.377
The land you gave us made us all wealthy men.

506
01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:29.048
However, we must question your motives.

507
01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:32.468
The day you arrived, you made us look like fools.

508
01:14:32.885 --> 01:14:36.013
That is absurd, Don Pedro.
I was merely playing to the crowd.

509
01:14:36.097 --> 01:14:39.684
And what are you doing now if not playing to the crowd?

510
01:14:39.767 --> 01:14:43.771
You're inciting us to raise arms against Santa Anna.

511
01:14:43.854 --> 01:14:47.191
You know perfectly well we could never defeat his army.

512
01:14:47.274 --> 01:14:50.903
I was not suggesting that we fight him for California.

513
01:14:50.987 --> 01:14:54.073
I was suggesting that we buy it from him.

514
01:14:54.615 --> 01:14:57.785
Santa Anna is waging an expensive war
with the United States

515
01:14:57.868 --> 01:14:59.787
and is increasingly short of money.

516
01:15:00.413 --> 01:15:03.040
Even if we all combined our fortunes,

517
01:15:03.124 --> 01:15:06.711
we could not come up with enough
to buy this country from Santa Anna.

518
01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:09.672
I have already brokered a deal with him.

519
01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:13.217
You're living in a dream.

520
01:15:15.177 --> 01:15:19.056
And why don't we all live in the same dream together?

521
01:15:34.113 --> 01:15:36.824
Meet me here tomorrow morning for a journey

522
01:15:36.907 --> 01:15:40.578
that will open your eyes and lay all your doubts to rest.

523
01:16:33.798 --> 01:16:38.719
My friends, I give you. . . El Dorado!

524
01:16:49.230 --> 01:16:52.566
Technically, of course, all this gold belongs to Santa Anna,

525
01:16:52.650 --> 01:16:56.862
but, fortunately for us,
he's completely unaware of its existence.

526
01:16:56.946 --> 01:16:59.865
For the deception to work, these bars have been marked

527
01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:02.952
with the Spanish seal so he'll think they're from Spain.

528
01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:07.540
You see now, gentlemen? Is it becoming clearer to you?

529
01:17:07.998 --> 01:17:11.919
Two days from now,
we will buy this country from Santa Anna.

530
01:17:12.002 --> 01:17:15.631
We will buy it with gold dug from his own land.

531
01:17:26.433 --> 01:17:31.772
-Where did you find all these people?
-Anywhere we wanted.

532
01:17:32.690 --> 01:17:34.358
Brilliant.

533
01:17:35.943 --> 01:17:37.611
Brilliant.

534
01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:43.284
It's only part of the mining process.

535
01:17:43.367 --> 01:17:46.704
First we picked it up off the ground,
now we're down to blasting.

536
01:18:01.302 --> 01:18:05.848
So. . . this is the future of California?

537
01:18:06.807 --> 01:18:09.643
This is my vision, yes.

538
01:18:13.272 --> 01:18:18.652
Up here. Well, now, ain't you a sight for sore eyes!

539
01:18:19.111 --> 01:18:23.991
Full-grown vultures walking around like real folk.

540
01:18:24.074 --> 01:18:27.995
Welcome! Welcome to hell's outhouse.

541
01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:34.668
They call us the disappeared ones,
but we ain't exactly disappeared.

542
01:18:34.752 --> 01:18:40.257
-We're just hard to find.
-Wait! You. I know you.

543
01:18:40.341 --> 01:18:42.259
You bet you do, peckerwood.

544
01:18:42.343 --> 01:18:44.970
I'm the legendary Three-Fingered Jack.

545
01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:48.641
And you are a bunch of murdering trash

546
01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:53.187
dressed up in fancy, sweet-smelling doodads.

547
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:56.315
Ignore him, gentlemen. He's a common thief.

548
01:18:57.149 --> 01:18:59.026
As common as they come.

549
01:18:59.109 --> 01:19:03.155
But I ain't nothing compared to you gentlemen.

550
01:19:03.239 --> 01:19:06.200
I steal gold, I steal money.

551
01:19:06.283 --> 01:19:10.829
But you steal people's lives.

552
01:19:10.913 --> 01:19:15.542
So damn you! And damn the horse that brung you!

553
01:19:34.353 --> 01:19:35.521
Peckerwood?

554
01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:22.151
Is there something amusing, captain?

555
01:20:22.693 --> 01:20:24.862
Strange, I'd say.

556
01:20:25.571 --> 01:20:29.575
It's the second time I've shot this man
while he was flying through the air.

557
01:20:37.708 --> 01:20:42.796
Don Alejandro! I need to speak
with you at the hacienda, alone.

558
01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:49.553
-Some other time, perhaps.
-Today. Alone.

559
01:21:12.284 --> 01:21:14.703
Good afternoon, Bernardo.

560
01:21:16.288 --> 01:21:18.582
Good afternoon, señorita.

561
01:21:18.665 --> 01:21:21.293
Your voice is so calming.

562
01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:24.004
He's high-spirited. He needs to hear something soothing.

563
01:21:24.088 --> 01:21:26.423
Yes, I understand.

564
01:21:28.675 --> 01:21:31.804
How long have you served Don Alejandro?

565
01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:35.849
Sometimes it seems interminable.
Sorry, I speak out of place.

566
01:21:35.933 --> 01:21:39.645
Do not worry, Bernardo. He will not hear it from me.

567
01:21:41.522 --> 01:21:44.858
Don Alejandro confuses me.

568
01:21:45.317 --> 01:21:50.614
Sometimes he seems so arrogant, so superior.

569
01:21:51.198 --> 01:21:56.578
And yet the way he looks at me
and the way he dances with me...

570
01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:59.164
As if he were two completely different men.

571
01:21:59.790 --> 01:22:01.250
Yeah.

572
01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:11.301
You look so much like your mother.

573
01:22:14.471 --> 01:22:15.806
How would you know that?

574
01:22:16.473 --> 01:22:21.895
Well. . . I don't see much of Don Rafael in you.

575
01:22:24.523 --> 01:22:27.651
I know my father wishes I acted more like her.

576
01:22:27.734 --> 01:22:31.738
She was very proper, my mother. Always appropriate

577
01:22:31.822 --> 01:22:33.532
Is that how he describes her?

578
01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:38.745
-Yes. But I do not believe him.
-She was more like you.

579
01:22:40.914 --> 01:22:44.877
Perhaps. It would be a way of knowing her.

580
01:22:49.214 --> 01:22:54.470
My niñera told me that the departed can see you
in the moonlight.

581
01:22:54.887 --> 01:23:01.101
When I was young, I sneaked out at night
and rode across Andalusia.

582
01:23:01.185 --> 01:23:04.813
I would wave at the skies so she would know it was me.

583
01:23:10.569 --> 01:23:14.281
-How did she die?
-Giving birth to me.

584
01:23:16.366 --> 01:23:19.536
My father rarely speaks of her. I think he finds it too painful.

585
01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.790
Yes.

586
01:23:27.085 --> 01:23:28.670
Well...

587
01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:33.091
I know what it is like to lose a loved one.

588
01:23:33.717 --> 01:23:34.718
You?

589
01:23:36.428 --> 01:23:40.307
Yeah. A daughter. Long ago.

590
01:23:42.601 --> 01:23:47.439
When I see you, I remember what it felt like to be a father.

591
01:23:51.443 --> 01:23:56.990
-Your mother would be proud of you.
-Thank you.

592
01:23:59.993 --> 01:24:03.872
Bernardo, I have to ask you, have we ever met before?

593
01:24:04.623 --> 01:24:07.584
No, why would you think that?

594
01:24:09.127 --> 01:24:14.091
I do not know. It's strange, your voice seems so familiar.

595
01:24:15.342 --> 01:24:18.136
I haven't been to Spain since before you were born.

596
01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:21.682
Of course.

597
01:24:23.308 --> 01:24:26.395
Well, it's a very pleasant voice.

598
01:24:27.854 --> 01:24:29.481
Thank you.

599
01:24:30.357 --> 01:24:33.443
-Good day, Bernardo.
-Good day...

600
01:24:39.324 --> 01:24:41.034
Elena.

601
01:24:56.383 --> 01:24:59.886
Did you know that the Compa Indians of central Peru

602
01:24:59.970 --> 01:25:04.308
used to cannibalize their enemies
in order to absorb their power?

603
01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:08.437
The eyes in particular were most sought after.

604
01:25:11.315 --> 01:25:17.154
To be able to see through the eyes
of an enemy. . . is a valuable thing.

605
01:25:22.075 --> 01:25:26.371
Where are my manners?
Would you care for something to drink?

606
01:25:33.045 --> 01:25:34.546
No?

607
01:25:35.255 --> 01:25:38.216
A different vintage perhaps?

608
01:25:47.267 --> 01:25:49.269
You're a very sick person, Captain Love.

609
01:25:51.563 --> 01:25:55.192
Heads in water jars, hands in wine pitchers...

610
01:25:55.275 --> 01:25:57.861
must strike you as odd, I suppose.

611
01:25:59.404 --> 01:26:03.367
Well, for one thing,
I think you ought to fire your housekeeper.

612
01:26:09.623 --> 01:26:13.627
-Who is he?
-An enemy.

613
01:26:15.379 --> 01:26:18.256
He has a brother out there who will share the same fate.

614
01:26:21.802 --> 01:26:23.679
I wish you luck.

615
01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:31.812
-To your health.
-Murrieta's brother or not,

616
01:26:32.437 --> 01:26:34.272
you are more than you pretend to be.

617
01:26:35.899 --> 01:26:40.612
Maybe someday I will see what I look like through your eyes,

618
01:26:40.696 --> 01:26:42.656
Captain Love.

619
01:27:28.994 --> 01:27:31.413
It is beautiful.

620
01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:50.432
Excuse me. How much does it cost?

621
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:59.691
It is a gift, she says, in honor of your mother.

622
01:28:01.193 --> 01:28:02.277
My mother?

623
01:28:04.321 --> 01:28:08.700
-She loved your mother.
-She must be mistaken.

624
01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:10.869
My mother died long ago in Spain.

625
01:28:23.381 --> 01:28:25.091
She says there is no mistaking

626
01:28:25.175 --> 01:28:28.553
the daughter of Esperanza and Diego de Ia Vega.

627
01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:34.476
She says she was your nanny.
She hung flowers on your crib.

628
01:28:37.562 --> 01:28:40.065
I'm sorry, I cannot accept it.

629
01:28:59.251 --> 01:29:00.961
Alejandro.

630
01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:07.676
Listen to me. Can you find your way back to the mine?

631
01:29:09.261 --> 01:29:10.762
No.

632
01:29:12.264 --> 01:29:15.267
The carriage windows were all covered.

633
01:29:16.476 --> 01:29:20.105
-He didn't even trust his own dons.
-Nor would I .

634
01:29:20.564 --> 01:29:22.774
You must go to Montero's house tonight.

635
01:29:22.858 --> 01:29:25.068
Break into the chest in his study.

636
01:29:25.151 --> 01:29:29.573
-Find out what his plans are.
-People in the mine are dying.

637
01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:35.662
And all I can think of is. . . Captain Love.

638
01:29:35.745 --> 01:29:38.456
He will come into your circle soon enough.

639
01:29:42.377 --> 01:29:44.504
-I miss my brother, sir.
-Your brother is dead.

640
01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:48.341
We lose the ones we love. Put it aside.

641
01:29:49.593 --> 01:29:51.303
How?

642
01:29:53.096 --> 01:29:55.682
How can I do what is needed

643
01:29:55.765 --> 01:30:00.520
when all I feel is. . . hate?

644
01:30:01.813 --> 01:30:03.648
You hide it.

645
01:30:05.567 --> 01:30:07.319
With this.

646
01:30:18.663 --> 01:30:22.000
Santa Anna has agreed to the transfer at noon
the day after tomorrow.

647
01:30:22.083 --> 01:30:25.462
He insists we deliver the gold five miles north of town.

648
01:30:25.545 --> 01:30:27.213
Captain Love?

649
01:30:30.592 --> 01:30:33.386
It's a safe distance from the mine.
The bars are stamped and ready.

650
01:30:34.095 --> 01:30:35.972
I don't foresee a problem.

651
01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:41.353
Tell him we agree. You've done well, Luiz. Very well.

652
01:30:44.981 --> 01:30:48.443
To the independent Republic of California.

653
01:30:52.113 --> 01:30:54.366
Don Rafael!

654
01:31:19.182 --> 01:31:21.935
You sent men to the hills? Doubled the guard at the wall?

655
01:31:22.018 --> 01:31:23.853
Yes, yes, of course.

656
01:31:30.235 --> 01:31:35.323
-After all, it's only one man.
-It isn't just one man. It's Zorro.

657
01:31:36.533 --> 01:31:40.912
And he knows about the mine.
Otherwise he wouldn't be here tonight.

658
01:31:41.496 --> 01:31:44.290
-How could he possibly--?
-It doesn't matter how.

659
01:31:44.916 --> 01:31:47.127
You don't seem to grasp the situation.

660
01:31:47.210 --> 01:31:51.798
If Santa Anna finds out about the gold stolen
from his own land, he will have us butchered.

661
01:31:52.757 --> 01:31:54.676
Do you understand?

662
01:31:57.262 --> 01:31:59.806
Then we should destroy the evidence.

663
01:31:59.889 --> 01:32:01.808
Set explosives. Bury the mine.

664
01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:07.814
-And the workers?
-We destroy all the evidence.

665
01:32:07.897 --> 01:32:09.065
No witnesses.

666
01:32:16.656 --> 01:32:19.367
Make sure those papers are locked up.

667
01:32:36.968 --> 01:32:38.887
Guards!

668
01:32:47.562 --> 01:32:53.318
-The much-debated Zorro.
-No. The legendary Zorro.

669
01:32:56.029 --> 01:33:00.116
Put down your weapons! Tell them.

670
01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:02.452
Do as he says!

671
01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:10.126
Allow me.

672
01:33:16.674 --> 01:33:19.219
Come. Stop.

673
01:33:20.804 --> 01:33:22.722
Face the window.

674
01:33:24.015 --> 01:33:28.269
Now, bend down and touch your toes.

675
01:33:29.854 --> 01:33:32.190
Bend over.

676
01:33:33.983 --> 01:33:39.280
Excuse me, Captain Love. Thank you.

677
01:36:02.257 --> 01:36:03.508
Kill him.

678
01:36:32.537 --> 01:36:34.706
Good morning, señor.

679
01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:41.379
-Good morning, señorita.
-Give it back.

680
01:36:42.255 --> 01:36:44.549
-What?
-Whatever it is you have stolen

681
01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:47.135
from my father, I want it back. Give it to me.

682
01:36:49.012 --> 01:36:50.513
No.

683
01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.230
Come on, now.

684
01:37:13.286 --> 01:37:16.289
I don't have the time to give you the proper instruction.

685
01:37:18.708 --> 01:37:22.587
I have had the proper instruction since I was 4.

686
01:38:15.932 --> 01:38:16.933
Not bad.

687
01:38:20.228 --> 01:38:22.230
Not bad at all.

688
01:38:44.752 --> 01:38:49.173
This will make it more difficult. Señorita.

689
01:39:14.449 --> 01:39:15.825
Don't move.

690
01:39:37.221 --> 01:39:40.850
-Do you surrender?
-Never.

691
01:39:41.559 --> 01:39:43.811
But I may scream.

692
01:39:44.896 --> 01:39:46.731
I understand.

693
01:39:47.190 --> 01:39:49.775
Sometimes I have that effect.

694
01:40:18.471 --> 01:40:19.889
Excuse me.

695
01:40:23.518 --> 01:40:25.645
Goodbye, señorita.

696
01:40:37.532 --> 01:40:39.033
What are you doing? What happened?

697
01:40:39.408 --> 01:40:44.747
Zorro. Zorro was here. I fought him and he left. He left!

698
01:40:45.164 --> 01:40:51.337
-Did you recognize him?
-No, but he was young and vigorous.

699
01:40:51.712 --> 01:40:55.675
-He was very vigorous, Father.
-Vigorous?

700
01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:57.301
Yes.

701
01:41:37.341 --> 01:41:38.926
Let's go!

702
01:42:55.878 --> 01:42:57.380
Go!

703
01:43:34.917 --> 01:43:36.001
Come on.

704
01:44:11.328 --> 01:44:16.250
Here. This is the canyon. That is where the mine is.

705
01:44:17.084 --> 01:44:21.839
They have 25, 30 guards at most.

706
01:44:21.922 --> 01:44:25.217
-Nothing that Zorro can't overcome.
-I'm not going with you.

707
01:44:25.301 --> 01:44:26.927
What?

708
01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:30.222
I'm not going with you.

709
01:44:31.432 --> 01:44:35.311
There's something I must do. It's a personal matter.

710
01:44:36.729 --> 01:44:40.816
-What about the prisoners?
-There's nothing more I can do.

711
01:44:41.859 --> 01:44:45.738
-You mean, nothing you will do.
-I gave my life to them.

712
01:44:46.614 --> 01:44:50.159
In return, I lost everything.
My wife was murdered before my eyes,

713
01:44:50.242 --> 01:44:53.954
and my child was stolen to be raised by my mortal enemy.

714
01:44:54.997 --> 01:44:55.998
Montero?

715
01:45:00.211 --> 01:45:01.754
Elena.

716
01:45:03.714 --> 01:45:05.007
She's your daughter.

717
01:45:06.967 --> 01:45:08.844
Yeah, she was.

718
01:45:13.390 --> 01:45:15.017
So...

719
01:45:16.185 --> 01:45:18.020
you will simply take your revenge.

720
01:45:18.103 --> 01:45:22.733
No, I will take my daughter.
And don't pretend she means nothing to you.

721
01:45:22.817 --> 01:45:27.947
She does. But you taught me to see
beyond personal feelings.

722
01:45:28.030 --> 01:45:32.785
-Was that all a lie?
-You're too young to understand.

723
01:45:32.868 --> 01:45:36.956
To understand what? Betrayal?

724
01:45:37.039 --> 01:45:41.126
All the work, all the training, all the wise words, for what?!

725
01:45:41.210 --> 01:45:46.006
To smile in the face of my brother's killer
while you make your own plans?!

726
01:45:49.218 --> 01:45:52.805
Alejandro, I taught you everything you need to survive.

727
01:45:53.305 --> 01:45:56.016
Now I must look to my own heart.

728
01:45:57.852 --> 01:46:01.438
Elena is all I have left. I'm not going to lose her again.

729
01:46:04.942 --> 01:46:08.737
What about California? What about the people?

730
01:46:09.530 --> 01:46:11.782
They still have Zorro.

731
01:46:40.561 --> 01:46:44.773
I have every inch of the countryside covered.
If he shows himself.

732
01:46:46.984 --> 01:46:49.486
-Are you all right?
-Do you have the map?

733
01:46:49.570 --> 01:46:53.282
-We'll find it.
-Is your army ready to fight Santa Anna's?

734
01:46:53.365 --> 01:46:56.702
-No, sir.
-Then of course I'm not all right.

735
01:46:56.785 --> 01:47:00.372
I'm beginning to wonder
if you want this operation to succeed at all.

736
01:47:00.456 --> 01:47:03.042
-What are you saying?
-What I'm saying, captain,

737
01:47:03.125 --> 01:47:06.962
is that I think my horse could run this army better than you.

738
01:47:11.634 --> 01:47:13.886
I said, I'll find him.

739
01:47:16.055 --> 01:47:17.473
That means I will.

740
01:47:20.851 --> 01:47:24.939
Perhaps I can save you the trouble.
Go on, reach for it, captain.

741
01:47:27.691 --> 01:47:31.695
-Who are you?
-I warned you long ago, Rafael.

742
01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:36.825
-That you would never be rid of me.
-De Ia Vega.

743
01:47:41.205 --> 01:47:42.539
Rafael.

744
01:47:42.831 --> 01:47:45.876
You were not the Zorro I saw last night.

745
01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:50.005
-That was your master, Don Alejandro.
-Yes.

746
01:47:50.089 --> 01:47:53.384
But there are many who would proudly wear
the mask of Zorro.

747
01:47:53.801 --> 01:47:58.180
Either way, events have been set in motion
that you cannot stop.

748
01:47:59.139 --> 01:48:00.766
I'm not here to stop you.

749
01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:04.561
Call for Elena.

750
01:48:08.983 --> 01:48:10.067
Call her.

751
01:48:12.987 --> 01:48:16.699
Captain, bring my daughter to me.

752
01:48:18.784 --> 01:48:20.786
Bring her to me!

753
01:48:29.545 --> 01:48:34.174
You cannot imagine, Rafael,
how I have dreamed of this moment.

754
01:48:34.258 --> 01:48:38.262
Night and day, 20 long years.

755
01:48:39.179 --> 01:48:43.308
Really? I haven't given you a second thought.

756
01:48:44.435 --> 01:48:50.691
-If I die, the truth dies with me.
-We shall see.

757
01:48:50.774 --> 01:48:51.775
Father!

758
01:48:53.277 --> 01:48:57.239
-Bernardo, what are you doing?
-Tell her, Rafael.

759
01:48:58.907 --> 01:49:03.412
-Tell me what? What is going on?
-Tell her who her real father is.

760
01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:06.123
Father, what is he saying?

761
01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:13.881
This. . . unfortunate man lost a daughter once,

762
01:49:13.964 --> 01:49:17.217
and now he seeks to claim you for his own.

763
01:49:20.054 --> 01:49:23.390
Tell her how her mother died.

764
01:49:27.102 --> 01:49:32.483
Your daughter is lost, de Ia Vega. You cannot have mine.

765
01:49:33.067 --> 01:49:34.401
De Ia Vega?

766
01:49:36.612 --> 01:49:39.573
A woman in town, she told me.

767
01:49:41.033 --> 01:49:43.285
Diego de Ia Vega?

768
01:49:46.330 --> 01:49:48.082
Father?

769
01:49:49.333 --> 01:49:51.835
His name is of no consequence.

770
01:49:55.422 --> 01:49:58.717
I was told my niñera used to hang something on my crib.

771
01:50:00.469 --> 01:50:04.264
Yes, she had her hang fresh flowers.

772
01:50:04.348 --> 01:50:05.974
No!

773
01:50:07.101 --> 01:50:08.936
No!

774
01:50:14.024 --> 01:50:18.195
Let us finish it, Rafael. Let us finish what we started...

775
01:50:18.612 --> 01:50:21.031
the night Esperanza died.

776
01:50:21.949 --> 01:50:25.994
Drop your sword, or I will have no choice
but to have you shot.

777
01:50:26.787 --> 01:50:29.456
Even in the presence of my daughter.

778
01:50:32.376 --> 01:50:34.294
Please.

779
01:50:49.434 --> 01:50:53.063
They were flowers. Romneya.

780
01:50:59.486 --> 01:51:00.571
Rafael...

781
01:51:03.699 --> 01:51:04.992
she knows.

782
01:53:14.079 --> 01:53:15.956
Water!

783
01:53:50.866 --> 01:53:51.950
Lock them up!

784
01:54:48.256 --> 01:54:50.842
The fuses are burning. Hurry it up.

785
01:54:55.389 --> 01:54:56.932
Let's go!

786
01:55:19.496 --> 01:55:20.997
Wait here!

787
01:55:30.674 --> 01:55:33.385
Secure the wagon, stay alert.

788
01:57:02.682 --> 01:57:06.102
-De Ia Vega.
-Rafael.

789
01:58:20.343 --> 01:58:22.554
Only one question.

790
01:58:25.932 --> 01:58:28.310
Really? What is that?

791
01:58:32.856 --> 01:58:35.859
How would you like your remains displayed?

792
02:00:05.532 --> 02:00:08.993
-Now I'm free to kill you.
-No!

793
02:00:16.209 --> 02:00:19.129
Drop the sword. Drop it.

794
02:00:29.305 --> 02:00:32.016
You really think I would have killed my own child?

795
02:00:57.375 --> 02:00:59.085
Did you miss me?

796
02:01:22.442 --> 02:01:23.985
Elena! Get them out!

797
02:01:32.035 --> 02:01:38.666
-"M" for Murrieta.
-Two men. One dead!

798
02:02:40.770 --> 02:02:45.316
You're doing well.
Your brother would have shot himself by now.

799
02:04:40.598 --> 02:04:41.766
Alejandro.

800
02:05:58.217 --> 02:06:00.303
Is it finished?

801
02:06:01.137 --> 02:06:05.600
Yes, Don Diego. It's finished.

802
02:06:07.143 --> 02:06:09.228
Not for Zorro.

803
02:06:09.687 --> 02:06:13.608
There will be other days, other battles to fight.

804
02:06:13.691 --> 02:06:16.611
It is your curse and destiny.

805
02:06:19.447 --> 02:06:21.532
My beautiful Elena.

806
02:06:24.368 --> 02:06:27.246
The world is a strange place.

807
02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:32.001
To have found you at last, only to lose you again.

808
02:06:32.418 --> 02:06:34.837
You will never lose me...

809
02:06:35.797 --> 02:06:37.548
Father.

810
02:06:41.177 --> 02:06:42.970
Elena.

811
02:06:45.431 --> 02:06:47.642
You are like your mother.

812
02:06:49.018 --> 02:06:51.395
Same eyes.

813
02:06:51.479 --> 02:06:53.689
Same mouth.

814
02:06:54.023 --> 02:06:56.275
Same spirit.

815
02:07:00.988 --> 02:07:02.949
Alejandro...

816
02:07:05.451 --> 02:07:07.453
Elena.

817
02:07:27.431 --> 02:07:32.353
And so it was. Lightning split the sky.

818
02:07:32.436 --> 02:07:34.856
Thunder shook the air.

819
02:07:34.939 --> 02:07:38.276
And then all was quiet.

820
02:07:39.402 --> 02:07:45.324
The great warrior known as Zorro was gone.

821
02:07:46.492 --> 02:07:48.786
The people of the land gave him a hero's funeral.

822
02:07:48.870 --> 02:07:51.455
The largest anyone had ever seen.

823
02:07:52.248 --> 02:07:55.376
They came from far and wide to say farewell

824
02:07:55.459 --> 02:07:57.837
to the brave and noble champion.

825
02:08:01.132 --> 02:08:03.885
But don't worry, little Joaquin.

826
02:08:04.468 --> 02:08:07.346
Whenever great deeds are remembered,

827
02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:10.141
your grandfather will live on.

828
02:08:11.267 --> 02:08:15.062
For there must always be a Zorro.

829
02:08:15.146 --> 02:08:20.568
And someday, when he's needed, we will see him again.

830
02:08:20.651 --> 02:08:25.698
On his fearsome steed, Tornado, riding like the wind.

831
02:08:25.781 --> 02:08:27.950
His sword blazing in the sun.

832
02:08:28.993 --> 02:08:32.413
Leaping, jumping! Swinging through the air!

833
02:08:32.496 --> 02:08:34.957
Fighting like a lion, fighting like a tiger!

834
02:08:35.041 --> 02:08:36.834
Fighting...

835
02:08:43.883 --> 02:08:45.718
as safely as possible.

836
02:08:47.553 --> 02:08:50.348
Is this your idea of putting the baby to sleep?

837
02:08:57.730 --> 02:09:00.191
Sleep tight, my son.

838
02:09:06.614 --> 02:09:12.536
When I sleep, I will dream of this dashing rogue, Zorro.

839
02:09:13.037 --> 02:09:15.748
But what face shall I give him?

840
02:09:16.749 --> 02:09:20.086
He has been many different men,

841
02:09:20.169 --> 02:09:22.964
but he has loved you as all of them.

842
02:09:27.843 --> 02:09:30.638
How can I refuse such a man?

843
02:09:31.889 --> 02:09:34.600
Do you know where I might find him?

844
02:09:35.101 --> 02:09:39.772
You know Zorro. He could be anywhere.

845
02:09:56.372 --> 02:09:59.208
There, there, my darling.
