1
00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:43.218
Come on, Alejandro, it is my turn.
Let me see.

2
00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:15.750
Hey, what are you doing
cutting holes in my wagon?

3
00:02:16.178 --> 00:02:20.547
I am sorry, senor Lopez.
We were just waiting for Zorro.

4
00:02:20.724 --> 00:02:24.057
- Go home, muchachos.
- Do you think he's going to come?

5
00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.185
Someone thinks he will

6
00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:34.439
Joaquin, Alejandro, once I carved coffins
for your mother and father.

7
00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:37.571
I would hate to carve ones for you.
Now, go!

8
00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:55.085
Alejandro, Joaquin, this is no place
for you. Now, get back to the mission.

9
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:25.371
Come on.

10
00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:51.686
Don montero, for the love of god,
why are you still here?

11
00:03:51.857 --> 00:03:55.099
Now, now, Don luiz. Calm, calm.

12
00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:59.524
Santa Anna's men are three miles
from the town. You have to go now.

13
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.199
The government of Spain would like
to thank you for your devoted service.

14
00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:15.202
This land is the property
of the Spanish government.

15
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.588
And in two hours' time it will be the
property of the Mexican government

16
00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.841
unless I hand them over to you.

17
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:22.467
I am well-acquainted
with Santa Anna.

18
00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:24.969
He will realize that the dons
will be dutiful tax payers

19
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.552
and he will respect your claims.

20
00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:31.514
The rest of California I have divided up
equally among the other dons.

21
00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:35.556
I trust that you will make sure
that all of them receive their grants.

22
00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:44.406
Get the children out of the Plaza
immediately.

23
00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:50.578
The children should not have to see
the things we do.

24
00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:55.205
I want to see! Put me down.

25
00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.798
Shh.

26
00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:05.044
Z0rro?

27
00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:15.721
I saw him. I saw Zorro. Come on.

28
00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:32.074
Who are these men that you would
risk your life to have them killed?

29
00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:34.581
Who are they? No idea.

30
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:37.083
Three peasants pulled at random
from the crowd

31
00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:54.180
Where is he?

32
00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:57.656
Come on.

33
00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:42.538
My thanks to you, gentlemen.

34
00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:53.504
Now, if you will excuse me,
I'm missing my own party.

35
00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.609
Kill him!

36
00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:27.295
Zorro!

37
00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:36.796
You would murder three innocent
men just to capture me?

38
00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:40.467
I would murder 100 innocent men
if it meant killing you.

39
00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:49.985
Three men, three cuts.
A small memento of Mexico, Rafael.

40
00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:52.191
To remind you not to return.

41
00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:37.922
Tornado, my old friend,
you are getting too old for this.

42
00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:42.047
Yes, me too.

43
00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:10.079
Is she warm enough?

44
00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:13.245
I always put on
an extra blanket for you, sefior.

45
00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:53.747
But the good prince was not afraid
of the evil king.

46
00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:56.629
He raced across the drawbridge,
fighting off 100 guards.

47
00:11:56.799 --> 00:12:00.257
And then, looking very handsome
and dashing in the late afternoon sun

48
00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:04.137
he leapt onto the balcony
and thrust his enchanted sword

49
00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:05.801
under the king's chin.

50
00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:10.977
"Would you kill three innocent men,"
he demanded, "just to capture me?"

51
00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:12.307
"Yeg"

52
00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:19.152
Suddenly, lightning flashed and a
mighty thunder shook the wasted land

53
00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:24.442
the evil king glared
at the good prince and said...

54
00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:27.909
Something very forgettable.

55
00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:31.827
And the good prince?
What did he do?

56
00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:37.996
Well, he leapt from the balcony
onto his faithful old steed, tornado...

57
00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:48.553
Never to do anything
so foolish or dangerous again.

58
00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:51.763
She loves to hear your stories.

59
00:12:53.856 --> 00:12:56.188
It's only the sound of my voice.

60
00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:58.600
One day she will have
no time for them.

61
00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:02.566
I never tire of them.
Why should she?

62
00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:11.867
Esperanza.

63
00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:21.046
- She already has your strength.
- Mm-hm_

64
00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:23.583
Today she broke the little Clay horse
you made for her.

65
00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:26.179
Diego.

66
00:13:26.264 --> 00:13:29.552
It's just a scratch.

67
00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:31.967
Diego, you promised me.

68
00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:36.013
No more nights waiting up,
praying you come home alive.

69
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:41.401
The spaniards are going home.
Today is Zorro's last ride.

70
00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:46.322
From now on we will grow
old together with our five children.

71
00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:50.986
- Five?
- Yeah. Not enough?

72
00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:53.913
I love youl.

73
00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:09.675
Dona de la vega,
still as beautiful as ever.

74
00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:15.769
Don Rafael, what an honor.
The governor in my home.

75
00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:17.428
You will stay for dinner, of course.

76
00:14:18.232 --> 00:14:21.816
I have come to apologize, Esperanza.

77
00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:26.776
I'm sorry that I could not protect this country
from the peasants who have overrun it.

78
00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:30.070
I'm sorry that I couldn't
make you love me.

79
00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:33.536
And I'm sorry that I have
to leave you without a husband.

80
00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:35.618
Arrest him.

81
00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:55.641
Blood never lies.

82
00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:56.972
Z0it0.

83
00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:01.306
You are a traitor to your country
and your class.

84
00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:03.600
Take him away.

85
00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:11.448
Wait

86
00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:12.384
I would never have let
any harm come to her.

87
00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:16.138
She was never yours to protect.

88
00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:21.560
Flena.

89
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.986
I want you to live

90
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.323
with the knowledge that you have
lost everything that you hold dear.

91
00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:42.248
I want you to suffer
as I have suffered

92
00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:44.579
knowing that your child
should have been mine.

93
00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:07.307
Flena! Flenal

94
00:17:23.417 --> 00:17:25.373
I et me hold her.

95
00:17:26.462 --> 00:17:28.544
I et me hold her!

96
00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:30.215
Rafael!

97
00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:33.549
She has her mother's eyes.

98
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:48.815
Rafael! You'll never be rid of Mel

99
00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:54.278
Never!

100
00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:28.722
J stayed on their track
bringing them back &

101
00:18:28.899 --> 00:18:34.110
j so pay the bounty now to me
"cause... j

102
00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:39.198

J nobody's tough as Jack j

105
00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:48.032
j nobody's tough as Jack jj

106
00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:50.955
Now you're getting there.

107
00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:55.920
Like I done told you,
singing can lighten your terrible load.

108
00:19:18.532 --> 00:19:23.743
Come one, come all,
for the fright of your life.

109
00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:30.000
See the notorious murrieta brothers.
Robbers, horse thieves

110
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:36.290
bandits, people of the worst sort.
Hey! Gather round here.

111
00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:43.676
Garcia. The murrieta brothers.

112
00:19:46.268 --> 00:19:49.635
Get over here. You stinking trash.

113
00:20:01.784 --> 00:20:05.117
These men are now in the custody
of corporal Armando Garcia.

114
00:20:05.287 --> 00:20:07.198
And we will take them
the rest of the way.

115
00:20:07.373 --> 00:20:09.785
And you can claim your bounty
in tlaxco.

116
00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:12.120
Yeah, when bulls start
wearing bloomers.

117
00:20:12.294 --> 00:20:14.956
How much are we worth?

118
00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:20.376
All figured, about 200 pesos.

119
00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:24.216
Two hundred pesos? That's it?
After all the payrolls we've robbed.

120
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.310
A lousy 200 pesos apiece,
that's all we're worth?

121
00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:30.639
- We are wasting time.
- That's 200 pesos for the both of you.

122
00:20:30.813 --> 00:20:34.522
What? Are you crazy?
Don't take it, Jack.

123
00:20:37.027 --> 00:20:40.986
Touch my brother again,
and I'll kill you.

124
00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:43.398
Yes, he will.

125
00:20:44.827 --> 00:20:46.158
Hey...

126
00:20:46.328 --> 00:20:48.068
I thought you were tied up.

127
00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:51.247
That's because you're stupid.

128
00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:59.000
Drop it.

129
00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:08.173
They've got a strongbox
on the wagon.

130
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:11.308
We know. That's why we came.

131
00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:13.310
Ah

132
00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:21.770
L, the legendary three-fingered
Jack, ain't even mentioned.

133
00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:23.687
I ain't even mentioned.

134
00:21:23.866 --> 00:21:29.031
And ain't I the one that figured
to kidnap the mayor from his own outhouse?

135
00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:33.369
I tell you,
I am the holy guts of this gang.

136
00:21:33.542 --> 00:21:37.034
Without me, the whole dang opera
falls apart.

137
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.711
Yah! Yah!

138
00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:14.450
Ah!

139
00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:30.717
Get up.

140
00:23:00.921 --> 00:23:04.960
I want you to know
I consider this an honor.

141
00:23:38.334 --> 00:23:42.703
Bury the body. Bag the head.

142
00:24:42.481 --> 00:24:45.894
Of course I have feelings for you.

143
00:24:46.068 --> 00:24:52.064
Yes, yes, but quick.
Hide in the barn.

144
00:24:52.282 --> 00:24:54.068
He's coming.

145
00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:02.247
What do you want?
Please don't touch me.

146
00:25:02.418 --> 00:25:05.205
What do you want? Who are you?

147
00:25:11.719 --> 00:25:14.426
Don Rafael

148
00:26:07.983 --> 00:26:09.974
Listen to me.

149
00:26:10.778 --> 00:26:13.815
If any of you is, or ever was

150
00:26:13.989 --> 00:26:17.982
that masked man all dressed in black
known as Zorro...

151
00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.947
Reveal himself now.

152
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:23.536
I'm Zorro!

153
00:26:24.625 --> 00:26:27.332
They took my mask, my sword...

154
00:26:27.503 --> 00:26:29.789
Silence, you old fool!

155
00:26:29.963 --> 00:26:33.797
I am Zorro!
I am the man you want.

156
00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:35.082
I am the original...

157
00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:39.173
Liar!
Anyone can see you are too tall.

158
00:27:25.435 --> 00:27:29.644
Get him out of here
before he starts to stink.

159
00:27:47.583 --> 00:27:49.369
Did you find him?

160
00:27:52.963 --> 00:27:54.703
He's dead.

161
00:27:55.924 --> 00:27:59.087
Back to the boat. I need some sleep
before landing tomorrow.

162
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.862
The governor has returned!

163
00:29:57.796 --> 00:29:58.796
I uiz.

164
00:29:59.965 --> 00:30:03.082
Welcome home, Rafael,
it has been too long.

165
00:30:03.719 --> 00:30:05.380
Too long, my friend.

166
00:30:05.846 --> 00:30:09.304
You said once, you favored me
above all

167
00:30:09.474 --> 00:30:13.558
consider this a fool's apology
for ever doubting you.

168
00:30:19.401 --> 00:30:21.266
Come.

169
00:30:21.695 --> 00:30:24.232
A crowd has gathered to greet you.

170
00:30:28.243 --> 00:30:31.235
- Don Pedro.
- Don Rafael, welcome.

171
00:30:31.413 --> 00:30:33.404
- You're looking well.
- Thank you.

172
00:30:33.623 --> 00:30:34.988
- Don Hector.
- Welcome back, sir.

173
00:30:35.167 --> 00:30:37.749
Don Julio.

174
00:30:38.337 --> 00:30:40.168
Gentlemen.

175
00:30:47.179 --> 00:30:50.012
Please, please.

176
00:30:50.932 --> 00:30:54.095
I know that you are not really happy
to see me.

177
00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:57.602
So let us all stop pretending,
shall we?

178
00:30:57.773 --> 00:31:00.765
You think I don't know
that you have been paid...

179
00:31:00.942 --> 00:31:04.526
Even threatened to come out
in the hot sun and greet me.

180
00:31:05.364 --> 00:31:09.198
I understand exactly how you feel.

181
00:31:09.368 --> 00:31:14.112
Why should you care about any
of your leaders, past or present?

182
00:31:14.289 --> 00:31:16.621
What did they ever do for you?

183
00:31:17.042 --> 00:31:20.785
The spaniards oppressed you,
the Mexicans ignored you.

184
00:31:20.962 --> 00:31:24.796
And the dons?
Well, the dons, the dons.

185
00:31:24.966 --> 00:31:30.131
The dons seem merely content
to cheat and lie to you.

186
00:31:32.307 --> 00:31:34.047
In fact, I put it to you:

187
00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:36.968
Who, in your entire history,
has ever helped you?

188
00:31:37.187 --> 00:31:40.304
Zorro!
Zorro fought for the people.

189
00:31:45.987 --> 00:31:48.694
Ah, yes, Zorro.

190
00:31:49.491 --> 00:31:53.825
Where is he now, padre,
your masked friend?

191
00:31:53.995 --> 00:31:57.658
Unless I am mistaken,
he hasn't shown himself in 20 years.

192
00:31:57.833 --> 00:32:00.495
Twenty years!

193
00:32:01.086 --> 00:32:04.169
People of California,
the time has come

194
00:32:04.339 --> 00:32:07.172
to take our destiny
into our own hands.

195
00:32:07.342 --> 00:32:13.008
Not as spaniards, not as Mexicans,
but as Californians.

196
00:32:19.646 --> 00:32:24.185
I stand here before you today
with no mask.

197
00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:26.020
Only a pledge.

198
00:32:26.194 --> 00:32:30.312
A solemn pledge
that I will never abandon you.

199
00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:34.278
And you have my word,
the word of Rafael montero

200
00:32:34.453 --> 00:32:36.159
that I will do everything
within my power

201
00:32:36.329 --> 00:32:40.743
to help you fight for a free
and independent California!

202
00:32:51.887 --> 00:32:53.752
Father.

203
00:32:59.019 --> 00:33:03.228
Gentlemen, allow me
to introduce my daughter, Elena.

204
00:33:10.405 --> 00:33:12.487
Thank you.

205
00:33:14.493 --> 00:33:16.358
Can anyone tell me
what this flower is?

206
00:33:16.536 --> 00:33:17.571
I know this scent.

207
00:33:17.746 --> 00:33:20.488
Si, senorita, it's called romneya.

208
00:33:20.665 --> 00:33:25.534
But it only grows in California, and I believe
this is your first visit to our shores.

209
00:33:25.712 --> 00:33:27.418
Yes

210
00:33:55.116 --> 00:33:58.904
Hey, hey, hey. More whiskey.

211
00:34:00.205 --> 00:34:01.945
Or whatever you call this.

212
00:34:02.123 --> 00:34:04.114
I don't wanna see
the bottom of this glass, huh?

213
00:34:04.334 --> 00:34:06.450
- Money first.
- Money first.

214
00:34:09.214 --> 00:34:11.830
Hey, hey, wait, wait, wait!

215
00:34:14.553 --> 00:34:16.293
What about this?

216
00:34:16.471 --> 00:34:17.471
Silver!

217
00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.632
Of course, silver. The finest.

218
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:29.229
Where did you get that?

219
00:34:29.401 --> 00:34:31.813
It's none of your business.

220
00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:34.895
Where did you get it?

221
00:34:38.118 --> 00:34:40.154
It was my brother's.

222
00:34:41.371 --> 00:34:43.111
He is dead.

223
00:34:45.584 --> 00:34:46.664
I'm sorry.

224
00:34:47.294 --> 00:34:49.000
You're sorry?

225
00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:51.582
Why should you be sorry?

226
00:34:53.174 --> 00:34:56.257
You should not trade something like that
for a mere glass of whiskey.

227
00:34:56.428 --> 00:35:00.341
Why not?
You think I could get two?

228
00:35:07.522 --> 00:35:09.228
Who is that?

229
00:35:14.029 --> 00:35:15.469
That's the man
who killed my brother.

230
00:35:15.614 --> 00:35:18.614
You're drunk and you're angry, no condition
to fight a professional soldier.

231
00:35:20.201 --> 00:35:22.192
Get out of my way, old man.

232
00:35:52.817 --> 00:35:55.229
Would you care to try again?

233
00:35:55.445 --> 00:35:57.561
Oh... you're welcome.

234
00:36:00.325 --> 00:36:01.405
For what?

235
00:36:02.327 --> 00:36:03.908
For saving your life.

236
00:36:08.249 --> 00:36:09.329
I would have killed him.

237
00:36:09.501 --> 00:36:12.834
No, not today. He is trained to kill.

238
00:36:13.004 --> 00:36:14.869
You seem trained to drink.

239
00:36:15.048 --> 00:36:18.006
Yes, my friend, you would have fought
very bravely and died very quickly.

240
00:36:18.176 --> 00:36:20.588
Who then would
avenge your brother?

241
00:36:22.263 --> 00:36:24.424
I would have found a way.

242
00:36:24.891 --> 00:36:26.427
I have never lost a fight.

243
00:36:26.601 --> 00:36:28.432
Except to a crippled old man
just now.

244
00:36:30.605 --> 00:36:31.811
What is your name?

245
00:36:32.607 --> 00:36:33.642
Alejandro.

246
00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:35.598
Alejandro.

247
00:36:37.987 --> 00:36:40.273
You know, there is a saying.
A very old saying:

248
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:42.450
"When the pupil is ready,
the master will appear.”

249
00:36:43.034 --> 00:36:45.025
Now, if you want to kill this man,
I can help you

250
00:36:45.203 --> 00:36:47.194
and I can teach you how.
How to move, how to think

251
00:36:47.372 --> 00:36:48.862
how to take your revenge
with honor.

252
00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:53.124
And live to celebrate it.
It will take dedication. It will take time.

253
00:36:54.295 --> 00:36:56.126
Why are you so eager to help me?

254
00:36:56.297 --> 00:36:59.630
Because once, a long time ago...

255
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:04.301
You did the same for me.

256
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:17.266
I can't believe it.

257
00:37:18.153 --> 00:37:20.485
I never thought that one day

258
00:37:20.655 --> 00:37:24.113
I would be standing
in the lair of the fox

259
00:37:24.534 --> 00:37:26.024
in the lair of Zorro.

260
00:37:28.288 --> 00:37:32.156
This place was devoted
to the training of Zorro.

261
00:37:33.668 --> 00:37:38.037
Where were you all these years?
I thought you were dead.

262
00:37:38.965 --> 00:37:41.331
I was dead.

263
00:37:41.509 --> 00:37:43.841
And we will leave it at that.

264
00:37:50.602 --> 00:37:54.015
I remember the last time I saw you
in the square.

265
00:37:54.189 --> 00:37:55.770
Fighting 100 men.

266
00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:56.975
A hundred men?

267
00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:00.483
I did not forget. You were the
greatest swordsman who ever lived.

268
00:38:00.653 --> 00:38:02.189
Yes

269
00:38:02.363 --> 00:38:06.106
Rafael montero
was the governor of California then.

270
00:38:06.284 --> 00:38:08.400
Do you remember him?

271
00:38:09.704 --> 00:38:11.444
What?

272
00:38:12.081 --> 00:38:14.197
Rafael montero.
Do you remember him?

273
00:38:15.877 --> 00:38:19.870
Yes. His soldiers killed many.

274
00:38:20.089 --> 00:38:23.832
And he was the sworn enemy
of Zorro.

275
00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:25.341
You.

276
00:38:26.012 --> 00:38:27.377
Montero has come back.

277
00:38:27.555 --> 00:38:29.716
Good. Then you can kill him.

278
00:38:29.891 --> 00:38:31.802
No, there are complications.

279
00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:34.217
Too many complications
for me to ignore.

280
00:38:35.897 --> 00:38:37.762
What complications?

281
00:38:44.489 --> 00:38:47.652
I can see we are not gonna
spend much time talking.

282
00:38:49.118 --> 00:38:52.736
Montero has some plans,
some design for California

283
00:38:52.914 --> 00:38:56.406
otherwise he would not have retained
the services of your captain love.

284
00:38:56.626 --> 00:38:58.742
We must find out what
that design is.

285
00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:01.252
- And then what?
- No

286
00:39:01.422 --> 00:39:05.165
if you are ready,
we will both tempt our fates.

287
00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:08.259
Let's go, then.

288
00:39:12.559 --> 00:39:14.766
Do you know how to use that thing”?

289
00:39:15.144 --> 00:39:18.181
Yes. The pointy end
goes into the other man.

290
00:39:22.777 --> 00:39:25.109
This is going to take a lot of work.

291
00:39:27.156 --> 00:39:30.899
This is called a training circle.
The master's wheel.

292
00:39:31.077 --> 00:39:35.195
This circle will be your world,
your whole life.

293
00:39:35.373 --> 00:39:38.456
Till I tell you otherwise,
there is nothing outside of it.

294
00:39:38.626 --> 00:39:42.960
- Captain love...
- There is nothing outside of it.

295
00:39:43.131 --> 00:39:47.295
Captain love does not exist
until I say he exists.

296
00:39:52.223 --> 00:39:58.264
As your skill with the sword improves
you will progress to a smaller circle.

297
00:39:58.438 --> 00:40:00.038
With each new circle
your world contracts

298
00:40:00.189 --> 00:40:02.069
bringing you that much closer
to your adversary.

299
00:40:02.191 --> 00:40:04.056
That much closer to retribution.

300
00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.230
I like that part.

301
00:40:08.323 --> 00:40:09.984
Shall we?

302
00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:35.839
Slow. Attack slow. Attack.

303
00:40:36.017 --> 00:40:38.929
Slow. Again. Slow.

304
00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:43.847
First triangle. Slowly. Good.

305
00:40:44.025 --> 00:40:46.141
Good. That is good.

306
00:40:46.319 --> 00:40:47.354
Thank you.

307
00:40:47.528 --> 00:40:49.860
Attack

308
00:40:52.659 --> 00:40:53.659
(ood.

309
00:40:55.662 --> 00:40:56.993
Time for a drink.

310
00:41:09.759 --> 00:41:12.375
Perfect. Do it again.

311
00:41:27.819 --> 00:41:28.899
Ooh!

312
00:41:29.737 --> 00:41:31.978
One, five, three!

313
00:41:33.408 --> 00:41:35.319
Six, four, two!

314
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:38.117
And lunge.

315
00:41:38.746 --> 00:41:40.987
- Over lunge.
- Ah! Ah

316
00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:43.076
ah!

317
00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:53.129
Never attack in anger.

318
00:41:58.182 --> 00:42:00.423
I esson number two:

319
00:42:01.436 --> 00:42:03.597
Come with me.

320
00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:07.430
What?

321
00:42:21.122 --> 00:42:22.953
So, what is lesson number three?

322
00:42:23.124 --> 00:42:25.581
To get to lesson number four.

323
00:42:47.148 --> 00:42:49.139
Again?

324
00:43:01.621 --> 00:43:03.327
Whoa whoa

325
00:43:11.172 --> 00:43:14.585
Black andalusian. Magnificent.

326
00:43:14.759 --> 00:43:16.670
It looks like
your old horse, tornado.

327
00:43:50.545 --> 00:43:54.629
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.

328
00:43:55.925 --> 00:43:57.665
Quiet, quiet.

329
00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:11.722
Damned horse.
What are you doing, huh?

330
00:44:11.899 --> 00:44:13.480
What are you doing?

331
00:44:16.404 --> 00:44:17.860
I'll see you tonight.

332
00:44:40.094 --> 00:44:43.552
Zorro, you look better than ever.

333
00:45:04.285 --> 00:45:06.446
Shh.

334
00:45:09.957 --> 00:45:14.792
Be careful, senorita,
there are dangerous men about.

335
00:45:14.962 --> 00:45:19.797
Well, if you see any,
be sure to point them out.

336
00:46:35.209 --> 00:46:39.794
Listen. I'm going to give you
the great honor

337
00:46:39.964 --> 00:46:41.204
of being my horse.

338
00:46:59.567 --> 00:47:03.230
We are like one spirit.

339
00:47:04.405 --> 00:47:06.487
Ah!

340
00:47:09.535 --> 00:47:11.241
Stop!

341
00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:10.300
Go, go, go!

342
00:48:15.267 --> 00:48:16.723
Oh.

343
00:48:41.502 --> 00:48:44.164
Gget him!

344
00:48:59.145 --> 00:49:00.180
\whoal

345
00:50:32.696 --> 00:50:34.687
Ah!

346
00:50:42.831 --> 00:50:44.446
Kill him.

347
00:51:20.661 --> 00:51:25.325
Zorro! The legend has returned!

348
00:52:04.496 --> 00:52:06.953
- Don't yell.
- Mm-mm_

349
00:52:09.376 --> 00:52:11.367
I need sanctuary, father.
You don't know me...

350
00:52:11.545 --> 00:52:14.036
Zorro! Of course I know you.

351
00:52:14.214 --> 00:52:16.170
Zorro, is it really you?

352
00:52:16.342 --> 00:52:19.142
I must say, the years have been
far kinder to you than they have to me.

353
00:52:19.303 --> 00:52:25.048
I have no time to talk now.
Father, please, hide me.

354
00:52:25.225 --> 00:52:26.556
Come.

355
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:32.846
Here. It's just like the old days.

356
00:52:41.575 --> 00:52:44.066
Padre, is that you?

357
00:52:44.912 --> 00:52:48.404
Padre, is everything all right? It sounds
like there is a battle going on out there.

358
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:54.870
Don't worry, my dear. You are safe
in the house of the lord.

359
00:52:55.047 --> 00:52:57.584
Of course, padre.

360
00:52:58.092 --> 00:52:59.569
Forgive me, father,
for I have sinned.

361
00:52:59.593 --> 00:53:01.629
It has been three days
since my last confession.

362
00:53:01.804 --> 00:53:04.762
Three days”? How many sins could
you have committed in three days?

363
00:53:04.932 --> 00:53:07.924
Come back when you have
more time, please.

364
00:53:08.102 --> 00:53:09.137
Fxcuse me?

365
00:53:10.771 --> 00:53:13.103
Listen, senorita...

366
00:53:15.984 --> 00:53:19.317
Please, go on.

367
00:53:20.489 --> 00:53:22.650
I have broken
the fourth commandment, padre.

368
00:53:23.784 --> 00:53:24.784
You killed somebody?

369
00:53:24.993 --> 00:53:26.779
No, that is not
the fourth commandment.

370
00:53:28.247 --> 00:53:30.488
Of course not. You... you.

371
00:53:31.583 --> 00:53:37.203
In what way did you break
the most sacred of commandments?

372
00:53:37.381 --> 00:53:40.043
I dishonored my father.

373
00:53:40.801 --> 00:53:44.293
That is not so bad.
Maybe your father deserved it.

374
00:53:44.513 --> 00:53:45.628
What did you say?

375
00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:50.883
I said, tell me more, my child.

376
00:53:51.645 --> 00:53:56.264
Well, I try to behave properly,
the way my father would like me to.

377
00:53:56.442 --> 00:53:59.058
But I'm afraid my heart is too wild.

378
00:53:59.236 --> 00:54:00.476
Too wild?

379
00:54:00.654 --> 00:54:01.939
Yes

380
00:54:02.114 --> 00:54:05.481
could you be a little more specific
about that?

381
00:54:05.659 --> 00:54:07.149
I had impure thoughts about a man.

382
00:54:08.579 --> 00:54:12.822
I did. I think he was a bandit
or something. He wore a black mask.

383
00:54:15.461 --> 00:54:18.749
He had a deep voice?

384
00:54:19.757 --> 00:54:20.792
Yes

385
00:54:21.675 --> 00:54:23.211
ruggedly handsome?

386
00:54:23.969 --> 00:54:27.507
I do not know,
his face was half-covered.

387
00:54:27.973 --> 00:54:31.056
But something in his eyes
captured me.

388
00:54:31.226 --> 00:54:32.682
Captured you?

389
00:54:32.853 --> 00:54:37.096
I felt warm and feverish.

390
00:54:37.858 --> 00:54:39.689
I ustful?

391
00:54:42.654 --> 00:54:44.269
Yes, lustful.

392
00:54:48.076 --> 00:54:49.441
Forgive me.

393
00:54:54.374 --> 00:54:56.205
I forgive youl.

394
00:55:00.214 --> 00:55:02.956
Look over there by the altar.

395
00:55:05.344 --> 00:55:10.839
Search everything. The chapel,
the loft, the rectory, all of it.

396
00:55:11.016 --> 00:55:13.849
This is a house of god.

397
00:55:14.019 --> 00:55:17.352
Don't worry, padre, we'll be gone
by the time he gets back.

398
00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:23.609
Senorita,
you have done nothing wrong.

399
00:55:23.779 --> 00:55:28.398
The only sin would be to deny
what your heart truly feels.

400
00:55:29.409 --> 00:55:31.365
Now, go.

401
00:55:34.498 --> 00:55:36.329
Flena.

402
00:55:41.338 --> 00:55:44.375
- What are you doing here?
- I was confessing.

403
00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:46.757
Confessing? Yes

404
00:55:47.427 --> 00:55:50.089
to whom? The priest is here.

405
00:55:53.267 --> 00:55:57.260
Stand back, Elena. Please.

406
00:56:15.747 --> 00:56:21.117
Out of respect for miss montero,
I'll deal with you later.

407
00:56:29.177 --> 00:56:31.793
Psst horse! Come here.

408
00:56:37.311 --> 00:56:40.474
Blackie! Thunder!

409
00:56:40.814 --> 00:56:41.929
Storm!

410
00:56:42.107 --> 00:56:45.691
Stupido! Get over here now!

411
00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:50.358
I warn you. I'll get another horse.

412
00:56:54.828 --> 00:56:56.284
Fh

413
00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:28.100
Hyah! Hyah!

414
00:58:00.227 --> 00:58:01.763
So”?

415
00:58:02.688 --> 00:58:04.553
What do you think?

416
00:58:08.568 --> 00:58:15.030
Sir, sir, I got the black stallion,
I carved a "z" in the...

417
00:58:16.743 --> 00:58:19.576
Don Diego, the people will be
speaking the name of Zorro again.

418
00:58:19.788 --> 00:58:22.200
You think stealing a horse
and scratching marks on a wall

419
00:58:22.374 --> 00:58:23.893
makes you worthy enough
to wear that mask?

420
00:58:28.213 --> 00:58:29.213
Be careful.

421
00:58:33.301 --> 00:58:38.011
You're a thief, Alejandro.
A pitiful clown.

422
00:58:38.181 --> 00:58:41.924
Zorro was a servant of the people,
he was not a seeker of fame like you.

423
00:58:43.437 --> 00:58:44.768
A buffoon.

424
00:58:47.607 --> 00:58:48.972
Zorro did what was needed

425
00:58:49.151 --> 00:58:51.016
now he is needed again.

426
00:58:53.613 --> 00:58:56.104
I didn't ask for your help
in the canting...

427
00:58:56.283 --> 00:59:00.617
But I came here
to learn how to fight like you.

428
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:03.912
To have your strength,
your courage.

429
00:59:04.082 --> 00:59:07.700
Now when I try to use them,
you slap me down?

430
00:59:08.837 --> 00:59:10.122
Let me tell you something.

431
00:59:10.338 --> 00:59:14.377
I am tired of all your training.
Your lecturing.

432
00:59:14.551 --> 00:59:18.760
I am tired of waiting for you
to tell me I am ready.

433
00:59:19.431 --> 00:59:24.971
I have my own scores to settle,
and a new life to find.

434
00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:30.973
I thought I could do it here,
but I was wrong.

435
00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:33.725
Alejandro!

436
00:59:34.654 --> 00:59:36.645
En garde!

437
00:59:40.577 --> 00:59:41.783
Choose your weapon.

438
01:00:02.182 --> 01:00:07.176
Montero has invited every Don in California
to a banquet at his hacienda.

439
01:00:07.395 --> 01:00:12.014
If you want to be of service,
you can join them as a spy.

440
01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:15.608
I think I do not understand, sir.

441
01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:20.530
You have passion, Alejandro,
and your skill is growing.

442
01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.512
But to enter montero's world,
I must give you something

443
01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:24.697
which is completely beyond
your reach.

444
01:00:24.913 --> 01:00:27.029
Oh, yes, what is that?

445
01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:29.660
Charm.

446
01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:32.871
And what is that?

447
01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:40.213
Convince montero
that you're a gentleman of stature...

448
01:00:40.387 --> 01:00:43.129
And he will let you into his circle.

449
01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.050
Me?

450
01:00:49.437 --> 01:00:51.268
A gentleman?

451
01:00:53.733 --> 01:00:55.644
This is gonna take a lot of work.

452
01:00:57.571 --> 01:00:59.527
Yes

453
01:01:17.966 --> 01:01:20.878
Look at me.
I look like a butterfly.

454
01:01:21.052 --> 01:01:23.259
This is the most stupid thing
I've ever done.

455
01:01:23.471 --> 01:01:24.551
I doubt that.

456
01:01:24.723 --> 01:01:26.088
We'll never get away with this.

457
01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:28.052
Yes, we will.

458
01:01:28.226 --> 01:01:33.437
A nobleman is nothing but a man
who says one thing and thinks another.

459
01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:35.563
What if montero realizes
who you are?

460
01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:38.771
Montero thinks of himself
3s a true nobleman.

461
01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:41.732
He will never look a servant
in the eye.

462
01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:43.443
Listen to me.

463
01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:45.778
Listen to me!

464
01:01:48.205 --> 01:01:53.416
Most important thing of all, do not let
the dons leave the table without you.

465
01:01:53.585 --> 01:01:56.292
Yes. Good.

466
01:01:56.504 --> 01:01:58.711
Good luck tonight.

467
01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:00.626
Thank you.

468
01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:05.260
Stand up straight. Charm.

469
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:07.136
Charm.

470
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:28.534
Don Rafael montero?
Good evening.

471
01:02:29.037 --> 01:02:31.574
I am Don Alejandro
del castillo y Garcia.

472
01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.143
The formal greeting
of the Spanish court.

473
01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:36.579
I have not seen that in years.

474
01:02:37.003 --> 01:02:39.745
My father was very strict
in matters of etiquette.

475
01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:41.496
And who is your father?

476
01:02:41.675 --> 01:02:44.291
Don bartolo del castillo.

477
01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:48.803
I've heard of Don bartolo, but I've
never had the pleasure of meeting him.

478
01:02:48.974 --> 01:02:54.014
I arrived last week from Spain by way
of Paris, Lisbon and San Francisco.

479
01:02:54.187 --> 01:02:57.270
I am inspecting
my family's holdings.

480
01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:06.946
Queen Isabella of Spain
has been very generous to us.

481
01:03:08.201 --> 01:03:11.693
Very impressive.
What brings you to my door?

482
01:03:12.372 --> 01:03:14.363
When I heard
you were back in California

483
01:03:14.541 --> 01:03:16.372
I knew I must introduce myself.

484
01:03:16.584 --> 01:03:18.996
Her royal highness speaks
very highly of you.

485
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:22.999
Really?

486
01:03:23.717 --> 01:03:26.397
I was under the impression I was
out of favor with the Spanish court

487
01:03:26.553 --> 01:03:28.794
since California was lost to Mexico.

488
01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.136
Uh

489
01:03:35.395 --> 01:03:37.761
Only in certain circles.

490
01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:42.687
Her majesty knows those unfortunate
events were clearly no fault of yours.

491
01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:46.395
She also told me this province
is still a land of opportunity

492
01:03:46.614 --> 01:03:48.900
for a man of vision.

493
01:03:49.117 --> 01:03:50.482
And you are a man of vision?

494
01:03:51.703 --> 01:03:55.241
I am a man in search of a vision.

495
01:03:58.126 --> 01:04:01.994
But my timing is unfortunate.
I have interrupted a party.

496
01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:04.413
Perhaps I could call again?

497
01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:08.842
No, no, it would honor me
for you to join us.

498
01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:12.846
No, it would honor me to do so, sir.

499
01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:16.679
- Please allow me to introduce my daughter, Elena.
- Of course.

500
01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:22.771
Charmed.

501
01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:29.776
I'm afraid I have brought no gift
for the hostess

502
01:04:29.949 --> 01:04:33.191
but wait a moment.

503
01:04:44.964 --> 01:04:48.172
- Thank you.
- A pleasure.

504
01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:57.758
Bernardo, pick up your feet.
Seaorita Caballero.

505
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:24.496
Don Alejandro.

506
01:05:25.713 --> 01:05:28.580
My father and I would like you
to join us at our table.

507
01:05:29.634 --> 01:05:32.717
I would be delighted, senorita.

508
01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:48.187
Ah, Don Alejandro, I'm so pleased
you could join us.

509
01:05:48.361 --> 01:05:52.195
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce
Don Alejandro del castillo y Garcia.

510
01:05:52.365 --> 01:05:54.697
Recently returned from Spain.

511
01:05:54.868 --> 01:05:57.655
This is captain Harrison love.

512
01:05:57.829 --> 01:06:01.196
Not a Don,
but certainly a kindred spirit.

513
01:06:02.834 --> 01:06:07.544
Are you not the man who was chasing
a legendary bandit recently?

514
01:06:07.755 --> 01:06:08.790
He was hardly legendary.

515
01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:11.206
So you caught him?

516
01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:13.124
It's only a matter of time.

517
01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:17.216
Well, the bandit
may have escaped

518
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:19.972
but the rest of us
will certainly think twice

519
01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:21.849
before going to confession.

520
01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:46.207
Oh

521
01:06:46.377 --> 01:06:47.913
Thank you.

522
01:06:51.299 --> 01:06:53.756
With all due respect, Don Hector,
I disagree.

523
01:06:54.385 --> 01:06:56.717
Until these people are free
to govern themselves

524
01:06:56.888 --> 01:07:00.631
I think we will see many more z's
carved into walls.

525
01:07:02.227 --> 01:07:04.138
Don Alejandro, what do you think?

526
01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:08.350
I think

527
01:07:09.317 --> 01:07:11.433
sheep will always need a Shepherd.

528
01:07:11.611 --> 01:07:16.776
But certainly not this Zorro creature.

529
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:20.943
He probably wears the mask to hide
his bald head and unsightly features.

530
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:27.832
There are some
who would call him heroic.

531
01:07:28.002 --> 01:07:30.459
Heroism, a romantic illusion.

532
01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:33.963
- Much like nobility.
- Elena, that is enough.

533
01:07:34.133 --> 01:07:37.876
Myself, I would think heroism is
something to aspire to, not sneer at.

534
01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:40.796
All that playing swords,
shooting guns

535
01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:42.805
racing around on horses...

536
01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:44.637
Gives me a frightful headache.

537
01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:48.720
Such sweaty pursuits are hardly
the work of a gentleman.

538
01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:51.890
And what is?
Climbing in and out of carriages?

539
01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:53.816
No, my dear.

540
01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:59.653
But increasing one's holdings so as to
provide lavish comfort for young ladies is.

541
01:07:59.826 --> 01:08:02.158
Such as yourself.

542
01:08:08.459 --> 01:08:11.201
A woman's grasp of politics.
What can I say?

543
01:08:15.008 --> 01:08:16.669
Well, we're at a party, aren't we?

544
01:08:16.884 --> 01:08:20.877
Elena, may I have the honor
of this dance?

545
01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:25.598
I would be glad to.

546
01:09:13.858 --> 01:09:16.600
Yes? Were you looking
for something?

547
01:09:17.236 --> 01:09:20.353
A sense of the miraculous
in everyday life.

548
01:09:21.574 --> 01:09:24.691
Oh, really”? Well, why don't you try
looking someplace else.

549
01:09:24.869 --> 01:09:26.734
The lady and I were trying to dance.

550
01:09:26.913 --> 01:09:30.246
You were trying.
She was succeeding.

551
01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:36.749
Forgive me, captain.
A shameless joke at your expense.

552
01:09:36.964 --> 01:09:38.545
I hope it will not be the last.

553
01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:41.924
Don Rafael wants you back
at his table. Now.

554
01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:32.054
Would you care to try
something more robust

555
01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:33.968
or do you feel unequal to the task?

556
01:10:34.147 --> 01:10:36.638
No, on the contrary,
Don Alejandro.

557
01:10:36.816 --> 01:10:39.603
I think only of your distaste
for perspiration.

558
01:10:41.529 --> 01:10:42.609
Maestro.

559
01:12:10.409 --> 01:12:13.321
That is the way they are dancing
in Madrid these days.

560
01:12:13.496 --> 01:12:16.488
Excuse me, Don Rafael,
I need to catch my breath.

561
01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:19.749
Your daughter is
a very spirited dancer.

562
01:12:19.919 --> 01:12:24.754
"Spirited." thank you
for putting it so delicately.

563
01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:30.922
I apologize if you're offended.

564
01:12:31.097 --> 01:12:34.840
Oh, no, no, no. Completely
unnecessary, I assure you.

565
01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:39.260
She is young and impulsive,
but her beauty is beyond compare.

566
01:12:39.438 --> 01:12:42.930
And she has her father's
commanding presence.

567
01:12:43.150 --> 01:12:44.890
Mm.

568
01:12:45.069 --> 01:12:46.934
Don Rafael

569
01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:54.943
as an advisor to her royal highness
in matters of finance

570
01:12:55.162 --> 01:12:59.371
it would be my pleasure
to introduce you both at court.

571
01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:12.718
Join us in the courtyard. There's
something I would like to share with you.

572
01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:15.087
What is that?

573
01:13:15.266 --> 01:13:16.506
A vision.

574
01:13:27.153 --> 01:13:29.815
Fellow dons of California.

575
01:13:29.989 --> 01:13:34.824
All of us can recall the golden years
when we ruled this country.

576
01:13:34.994 --> 01:13:39.738
We commanded respect as noblemen
and amassed a great deal of wealth.

577
01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:41.998
But there was something
that we never achieved

578
01:13:42.168 --> 01:13:45.831
we never determined
our own destiny.

579
01:13:47.131 --> 01:13:49.668
Well, the time has come.

580
01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:53.505
The time to claim what always
should have been ours.

581
01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:56.011
My friends...

582
01:13:56.974 --> 01:14:03.015
I give you the independent
Republic of California.

583
01:14:17.495 --> 01:14:19.360
Don Rafael

584
01:14:19.538 --> 01:14:21.403
every man here
owes you something.

585
01:14:21.582 --> 01:14:24.369
The land you gave us
made us all wealthy men.

586
01:14:24.543 --> 01:14:29.128
However, we must question
your motives.

587
01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:32.461
The day you arrived on the beach,
you made us all look like fools.

588
01:14:32.885 --> 01:14:36.048
That is absurd, Don Pedro,
I was merely playing to the crowd.

589
01:14:36.222 --> 01:14:39.635
And what are you doing now
if not playing to the crowd?

590
01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:43.893
Now you're inciting us to raise arms
against Santa Anna.

591
01:14:44.063 --> 01:14:47.226
You know perfectly well
we could never defeat his army.

592
01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:51.018
I was not suggesting
that we fight him for California.

593
01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:54.062
I was suggesting that
we buy it from him.

594
01:14:54.573 --> 01:14:56.859
Santa Anna is waging
a very expensive war

595
01:14:57.034 --> 01:14:59.776
with the United States
and is increasingly short of money.

596
01:15:00.413 --> 01:15:02.745
Even if we all combined
our fortunes

597
01:15:02.915 --> 01:15:04.826
we could not come up
with enough money

598
01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:06.662
to buy this country
from Santa Anna.

599
01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:09.664
I have already brokered
3 deal with him.

600
01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:13.206
You are living in a dream, montero.

601
01:15:15.094 --> 01:15:19.212
And why don't we all live
in the same dream together?

602
01:15:34.113 --> 01:15:36.775
Meet me here tomorrow morning,
gentlemen, for a journey

603
01:15:36.949 --> 01:15:40.612
that will open your eyes
and lay all your doubts to rest.

604
01:16:03.642 --> 01:16:05.633
Whoa, whoa.

605
01:16:33.964 --> 01:16:37.127
My friends, I give you...

606
01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:38.711
Fl dorado!

607
01:16:49.313 --> 01:16:52.521
Technically, of course,
all this gold belongs to Santa Anna

608
01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:56.809
but, fortunately for us, he's
completely unaware of its existence.

609
01:16:56.987 --> 01:16:59.148
Now, for the deception to work,
all these bars

610
01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:01.314
have been marked
with the Spanish seal

611
01:17:01.492 --> 01:17:04.279
so that he will think
they've come from Spain.

612
01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:07.536
You see now, gentlemen?
Is it becoming clearer to you?

613
01:17:07.706 --> 01:17:12.450
Two days from now we will buy
this country from Santa Anna.

614
01:17:12.628 --> 01:17:15.620
We will buy it with gold
dug from his own land.

615
01:17:26.433 --> 01:17:28.799
Where did you find
all these people?

616
01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:31.977
Anywhere we wanted.

617
01:17:32.690 --> 01:17:34.555
Brilliant.

618
01:17:35.943 --> 01:17:36.978
Brilliant.

619
01:17:40.739 --> 01:17:43.071
It's only part of the mining process.

620
01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:45.053
First we were just
picking it up off the ground

621
01:17:45.077 --> 01:17:46.738
but now we're down to blasting.

622
01:18:01.468 --> 01:18:06.087
So this is the future of California?”

623
01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:09.719
This is my vision, yes.

624
01:18:13.272 --> 01:18:18.642
Up here. Well.
Now ain't you a sight for sore eyes!

625
01:18:18.819 --> 01:18:24.109
Full-grown vultures
walking around like real folks.

626
01:18:24.283 --> 01:18:28.026
Welcome.
Welcome to hell's outhouse.

627
01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:31.116
Now, they call us
the disappeared ones

628
01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:34.703
but as you can see,
we ain't exactly disappeared.

629
01:18:34.877 --> 01:18:36.583
We just been a little hard to find.

630
01:18:36.754 --> 01:18:40.292
Wait! You. I know you.

631
01:18:40.507 --> 01:18:42.088
You bet you do, peckerwood.

632
01:18:42.259 --> 01:18:44.966
I'm the legendary
three-fingered Jack.

633
01:18:45.137 --> 01:18:48.629
And you are a bunch
of murdering trash

634
01:18:48.807 --> 01:18:53.221
dressed up in fancy,
sweet-smelling doodads.

635
01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:56.307
Ignore him, gentlemen.
He's a common thief

636
01:18:56.482 --> 01:18:58.939
hah! As common as they come.

637
01:18:59.109 --> 01:19:03.148
But I ain't nothing
compared to you gentlemen.

638
01:19:03.322 --> 01:19:06.155
I steal gold. I steal money.

639
01:19:06.325 --> 01:19:10.034
But you? You steal people's lives.

640
01:19:10.913 --> 01:19:14.246
So damn youl!
And damn the horse that brung you.

641
01:19:34.353 --> 01:19:35.513
Peckerwood?

642
01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:22.352
Is there something
amusing, captain?

643
01:20:22.693 --> 01:20:25.105
Strange, I'd say.

644
01:20:25.612 --> 01:20:29.605
It's the second time I've shot this man
while he was flying through the air.

645
01:20:37.708 --> 01:20:42.828
Don Alejandro! I need to speak with you
at the hacienda alone.

646
01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:46.046
Some other time, perhaps.

647
01:20:46.216 --> 01:20:49.333
Today. Alone.

648
01:21:12.284 --> 01:21:14.946
Good afternoon, Bernardo.

649
01:21:15.996 --> 01:21:18.533
Good afternoon, sefiorita.

650
01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:21.119
Your voice is so calming.

651
01:21:21.293 --> 01:21:23.909
He's high-spirited. He needs to hear
something soothing.

652
01:21:24.088 --> 01:21:26.454
Yes, I understand.

653
01:21:28.592 --> 01:21:31.755
How long have you served
Don Alejandro?

654
01:21:31.929 --> 01:21:33.590
Sometimes it seems interminable.

655
01:21:33.764 --> 01:21:35.880
I'm sorry. I speak out of place.

656
01:21:36.058 --> 01:21:40.176
Do not worry, Bernardo.
He will not hear it from me.

657
01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:44.813
Don Alejandro confuses me.

658
01:21:45.317 --> 01:21:50.653
Sometimes he seems
so arrogant and so superior.

659
01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:56.780
And yet the way that he looks at me
and the way that he dances with me...

660
01:21:56.954 --> 01:21:59.161
As if he were
two completely different men.

661
01:21:59.832 --> 01:22:01.242
Yeah

662
01:22:09.716 --> 01:22:12.458
You look so much like your mother.

663
01:22:14.471 --> 01:22:15.802
How would you know that?

664
01:22:16.515 --> 01:22:18.255
Well

665
01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:21.847
I don't see much
of Don Rafael in you.

666
01:22:24.523 --> 01:22:27.856
I know my father wishes
I acted more like her.

667
01:22:28.026 --> 01:22:31.610
She was very proper, my mother,
always appropriate.

668
01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:33.520
Is that how he describes her?

669
01:22:33.699 --> 01:22:36.941
Yes. But sometimes
I do not believe him.

670
01:22:37.119 --> 01:22:38.734
She was more like you.

671
01:22:40.998 --> 01:22:42.954
Perhaps.

672
01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:46.037
It would be a way of knowing her.

673
01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:51.129
My nifiera once told me

674
01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:54.838
that the departed
can see you in the moonlight.

675
01:22:55.012 --> 01:22:57.879
When I was young I used to
sneak out of my window at night

676
01:22:58.056 --> 01:23:01.048
and ride my horse
across andalusia

677
01:23:01.226 --> 01:23:04.810
I would wave at the skies
so she would know it was me.

678
01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:11.892
How did she die?

679
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:14.482
Giving birth to me.

680
01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:16.271
Oh.

681
01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:20.784
My father rarely speaks of her.
I think he finds it too painful.

682
01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.786
Yes

683
01:23:27.085 --> 01:23:28.746
well

684
01:23:30.047 --> 01:23:33.084
I know what it is like
to lose a loved one.

685
01:23:33.759 --> 01:23:35.499
You?

686
01:23:36.553 --> 01:23:40.341
Yeah. A daughter. Long ago.

687
01:23:42.768 --> 01:23:47.808
When I see you, I remember
what it felt like to be a father.

688
01:23:51.443 --> 01:23:54.435
I'm sure your mother
would be very proud of you, seforita.

689
01:23:55.197 --> 01:23:57.313
Thank you.

690
01:23:59.952 --> 01:24:03.865
Bernardo, I have to ask you,
have we ever met before?

691
01:24:04.623 --> 01:24:07.581
No, why would you think that?

692
01:24:09.253 --> 01:24:11.539
I do not know. It's strange.

693
01:24:11.838 --> 01:24:14.045
Your voice seems
so familiar somehow.

694
01:24:15.342 --> 01:24:18.129
I haven't been to Spain
since before you were born.

695
01:24:19.763 --> 01:24:21.719
Of course.

696
01:24:23.308 --> 01:24:26.345
Well, it's a very pleasant voice.

697
01:24:27.854 --> 01:24:29.435
Thank you.

698
01:24:30.482 --> 01:24:31.642
Good day, Bernardo.

699
01:24:31.817 --> 01:24:33.648
Good day...

700
01:24:39.324 --> 01:24:41.110
Elena.

701
01:24:56.383 --> 01:24:59.841
Did you know that the compa Indians
of central Peru

702
01:25:00.012 --> 01:25:01.673
used to cannibalize
their slain enemies

703
01:25:01.847 --> 01:25:04.384
in order to absorb their power?

704
01:25:04.891 --> 01:25:08.679
The eyes, in particular,
were most sought after.

705
01:25:11.315 --> 01:25:14.682
To be able to see through the eyes
of an enemy...

706
01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:17.397
Is a valuable thing.

707
01:25:22.034 --> 01:25:26.368
Where are my manners? Would you
care for something to drink?

708
01:25:33.045 --> 01:25:34.660
No?

709
01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:38.501
A different vintage perhaps?

710
01:25:47.225 --> 01:25:50.467
You're a very sick person,
captain love.

711
01:25:51.563 --> 01:25:55.147
Heads in water jars,
hands in wine pitchers...

712
01:25:55.317 --> 01:25:57.899
Must strike you as odd, I suppose.

713
01:25:59.321 --> 01:26:03.234
Well, for one thing, I think you ought
to fire your housekeeper.

714
01:26:09.581 --> 01:26:10.661
Who is he?

715
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:13.581
An enemy.

716
01:26:15.379 --> 01:26:18.246
He has a brother out there
who will share the same fate.

717
01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:23.876
I wish you luck.

718
01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:32.263
- To your health.
- Murrieta's brother or not.

719
01:26:32.479 --> 01:26:35.767
You are more than
you pretend to be.

720
01:26:35.941 --> 01:26:40.560
Maybe someday I will see
what I look like through your eyes...

721
01:26:40.737 --> 01:26:42.602
Captain love.

722
01:27:29.035 --> 01:27:31.651
Oh, it is beautiful.

723
01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:50.178
Excuse me, how much does it cost?

724
01:27:56.188 --> 01:27:59.680
It is a gift, she says,
in honor of your mother.

725
01:28:01.193 --> 01:28:02.273
My mother?

726
01:28:04.321 --> 01:28:05.686
She loved your mother.

727
01:28:08.825 --> 01:28:10.861
My mother died long ago in Spain.

728
01:28:23.381 --> 01:28:25.542
She says there is no mistaking
the daughter

729
01:28:25.717 --> 01:28:28.504
of Esperanza
and Diego de la vega.

730
01:28:28.678 --> 01:28:30.293
She says she was your nanny.

731
01:28:31.139 --> 01:28:34.552
She hung flowers on your crib
when you were little.

732
01:28:37.604 --> 01:28:40.061
I'm sorry, I cannot accept it.

733
01:28:59.334 --> 01:29:01.120
Alejandro.

734
01:29:02.504 --> 01:29:07.715
Alejandro, listen to me. Can you find
your way back to the mine?

735
01:29:09.261 --> 01:29:11.092
No

736
01:29:12.264 --> 01:29:15.347
The carriage windows
were all covered.

737
01:29:16.518 --> 01:29:18.099
He didn't even trust his own dons.

738
01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:20.431
Nor would I

739
01:29:20.647 --> 01:29:22.729
you must go to
montero's house tonight.

740
01:29:22.899 --> 01:29:25.015
Break into the chest in his study.

741
01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:27.004
Find anything that will tell us
what his plans are.

742
01:29:27.028 --> 01:29:29.644
People in the mine are dying.

743
01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:35.610
And all I can think of
is captain love.

744
01:29:35.787 --> 01:29:38.449
He will come into your circle soon enough,
you need not chase him.

745
01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:43.540
I miss my brother, sir.

746
01:29:43.712 --> 01:29:45.577
Your brother is dead.

747
01:29:45.755 --> 01:29:48.371
We lose the ones we love,
we cannot change it. Put it aside.

748
01:29:49.593 --> 01:29:51.333
How?

749
01:29:53.179 --> 01:29:55.636
How can I do what is heeded.

750
01:29:55.807 --> 01:30:00.426
When all I feel is hate?

751
01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:03.641
You hide it.

752
01:30:05.692 --> 01:30:07.648
With this

753
01:30:18.705 --> 01:30:21.947
Santa Anna has agreed to
the transfer the day after tomorrow.

754
01:30:22.125 --> 01:30:25.413
But he insists we deliver the gold
five miles north of town.

755
01:30:25.587 --> 01:30:27.327
Captain love?

756
01:30:30.842 --> 01:30:33.482
It's a safe distance from the mine.
The bars are stamped and ready.

757
01:30:33.970 --> 01:30:36.006
I don't foresee a problem.

758
01:30:36.514 --> 01:30:38.300
Tell him we agree.

759
01:30:38.475 --> 01:30:41.512
You have done well, luiz. Very well.

760
01:30:45.023 --> 01:30:48.515
To the independent
Republic of California.

761
01:30:52.113 --> 01:30:54.320
Don Rafael!

762
01:31:19.057 --> 01:31:21.799
You sent men to the hills?
Doubled the guard at the wall?

763
01:31:21.977 --> 01:31:23.888
Yes, yes, of course.

764
01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:31.566
After all, it's only one man.

765
01:31:31.736 --> 01:31:35.320
It isn't just one man, damn it.
It's Zorro.

766
01:31:36.533 --> 01:31:38.239
And he knows about the mine.

767
01:31:38.410 --> 01:31:41.152
Otherwise he wouldn't
be here tonight.

768
01:31:41.538 --> 01:31:44.746
- How could he possibly... 7
- It doesn't matter how.

769
01:31:44.916 --> 01:31:47.077
You don't seem to grasp
the situation, captain.

770
01:31:47.293 --> 01:31:50.398
If Santa Anna finds out that we have paid
him in gold stolen from his own land,

771
01:31:50.422 --> 01:31:51.902
he will have us butchered
like cattle.

772
01:31:52.757 --> 01:31:54.873
- Do you understand?
- Mm_

773
01:31:57.262 --> 01:31:59.753
Then we should
destroy the evidence.

774
01:31:59.931 --> 01:32:01.796
Set explosives. Bury the mine.

775
01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:05.140
And the workers?

776
01:32:05.311 --> 01:32:07.768
We destroy all the evidence,
Don Rafael

777
01:32:07.939 --> 01:32:09.895
no withesses.

778
01:32:16.823 --> 01:32:19.530
Make sure those papers
are locked up.

779
01:32:36.968 --> 01:32:38.879
Guards!

780
01:32:47.645 --> 01:32:49.556
The much-debated Zorro.

781
01:32:49.731 --> 01:32:51.346
No

782
01:32:51.733 --> 01:32:53.348
The legendary Zorro.

783
01:32:56.154 --> 01:32:58.315
Put down your weapons!

784
01:32:58.490 --> 01:33:00.071
Tell them.

785
01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:02.323
Do as he says.

786
01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:10.161
Allow me.

787
01:33:10.335 --> 01:33:12.576
Ah, ah.

788
01:33:16.674 --> 01:33:19.211
Come. Stop.

789
01:33:20.887 --> 01:33:22.843
Face the window.

790
01:33:24.015 --> 01:33:28.133
Now, bend down
and touch your toes.

791
01:33:29.896 --> 01:33:32.182
Bend over!

792
01:33:33.983 --> 01:33:35.894
Would you excuse me, captain love.

793
01:33:37.403 --> 01:33:39.018
Thank you.

794
01:36:02.257 --> 01:36:03.497
Kill him!

795
01:36:32.578 --> 01:36:34.534
Good morning, sefor.

796
01:36:39.085 --> 01:36:40.245
(Good morning, senorita.

797
01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:42.035
Give it back.

798
01:36:42.213 --> 01:36:44.499
What?
Whatever it is you have stolen

799
01:36:44.674 --> 01:36:47.131
from my father, I want it back.
Give it to me.

800
01:36:48.845 --> 01:36:50.585
No

801
01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:55.431
Ooh

802
01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.385
come on now.

803
01:37:13.244 --> 01:37:16.281
I don't have the time
to give you the proper instruction.

804
01:37:18.708 --> 01:37:22.747
I have had the proper instruction
since I was 4.

805
01:37:55.453 --> 01:37:56.488
Hm

806
01:38:15.973 --> 01:38:16.973
Not bad

807
01:38:20.228 --> 01:38:22.219
not bad at all

808
01:38:22.397 --> 01:38:23.887
ah!

809
01:38:25.817 --> 01:38:27.648
Hm.

810
01:38:44.752 --> 01:38:46.834
This will make it more difficult.

811
01:38:47.004 --> 01:38:49.165
Uh senorita

812
01:38:55.138 --> 01:38:56.503
Ah!

813
01:39:14.449 --> 01:39:15.859
Don't move.

814
01:39:37.221 --> 01:39:38.711
Do you surrender?

815
01:39:38.890 --> 01:39:40.846
Never.

816
01:39:41.559 --> 01:39:43.891
But I may scream.

817
01:39:44.896 --> 01:39:47.057
I understand.

818
01:39:47.231 --> 01:39:49.893
Sometimes I have that effect.

819
01:40:18.596 --> 01:40:19.927
Fxcuse me.

820
01:40:20.097 --> 01:40:21.678
Ah!

821
01:40:23.518 --> 01:40:26.100
Goodbye, senorita.

822
01:40:37.532 --> 01:40:39.172
What are you doing in here?
What happened?

823
01:40:39.408 --> 01:40:44.778
Zorro. Zorro was here.
I fought him, and he left. He left!

824
01:40:44.956 --> 01:40:46.446
Did you recognize him?

825
01:40:46.624 --> 01:40:48.285
No

826
01:40:48.459 --> 01:40:51.371
But he was young and vigorous.

827
01:40:51.712 --> 01:40:53.828
He was very vigorous, father.

828
01:40:54.632 --> 01:40:55.667
Vigorous?

829
01:40:56.342 --> 01:40:57.342
Yes

830
01:41:32.253 --> 01:41:34.369
Hyah, hyah, hyah!

831
01:41:37.466 --> 01:41:38.922
Let's go!

832
01:42:55.628 --> 01:42:57.414
(Go!

833
01:43:07.181 --> 01:43:08.261
Ha, ha!

834
01:43:11.018 --> 01:43:13.760
Hyah! Hyah!

835
01:43:35.292 --> 01:43:36.782
Come on.

836
01:44:11.328 --> 01:44:13.740
Here. This is the canyon.

837
01:44:13.914 --> 01:44:16.326
That is where the mine is.

838
01:44:17.084 --> 01:44:21.794
They have 25, 30 guards at most.

839
01:44:21.964 --> 01:44:23.324
Nothing that Zorro can't overcome.

840
01:44:23.424 --> 01:44:25.164
I'm not going with you.

841
01:44:25.342 --> 01:44:27.173
What?

842
01:44:27.678 --> 01:44:30.260
I'm not going with you.

843
01:44:31.557 --> 01:44:35.470
There's something I must do.
It's a personal matter.

844
01:44:36.687 --> 01:44:38.268
What about the prisoners?

845
01:44:38.439 --> 01:44:40.851
There's nothing more
I can do for them.

846
01:44:41.859 --> 01:44:43.440
You mean, nothing you will do.

847
01:44:43.611 --> 01:44:45.818
I gave my life to them.

848
01:44:46.614 --> 01:44:48.605
And in return I lost everything.

849
01:44:48.783 --> 01:44:50.944
My wife was murdered
before my eyes

850
01:44:51.118 --> 01:44:53.985
and my child was stolen
to be raised by my mortal enemy.

851
01:44:55.289 --> 01:44:56.995
Montero?

852
01:45:00.211 --> 01:45:01.872
Flena.

853
01:45:03.714 --> 01:45:05.796
She's your daughter.

854
01:45:06.967 --> 01:45:09.174
Yeah she was.

855
01:45:13.474 --> 01:45:15.089
So

856
01:45:16.185 --> 01:45:17.971
Vou will simply take your revenge.

857
01:45:18.145 --> 01:45:20.386
No, I will take my daughter.

858
01:45:20.606 --> 01:45:22.722
And don't pretend
she means nothing to you.

859
01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:27.894
She does. But you taught me to see beyond
personal feelings, remember?

860
01:45:28.072 --> 01:45:29.232
Was that all a lie?

861
01:45:31.367 --> 01:45:32.777
You're too young to understand.

862
01:45:32.952 --> 01:45:36.786
To understand what? Betrayal?

863
01:45:37.248 --> 01:45:41.241
All the work, all the training,
all the wise words, for what?

864
01:45:41.418 --> 01:45:46.082
To smile in the face of my brother's killer
while you make your own plans?

865
01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:53.173
Alejandro, I taught you everything
you need to survive.

866
01:45:53.347 --> 01:45:56.134
Now I must look to my own heart.

867
01:45:57.685 --> 01:45:59.596
Flena is all I have left

868
01:45:59.770 --> 01:46:02.432
I'm not going to lose her again.

869
01:46:05.025 --> 01:46:08.813
What about California?
What about the people?

870
01:46:09.572 --> 01:46:11.813
They still have Zorro.

871
01:46:40.686 --> 01:46:42.472
I have every inch
of the countryside covered.

872
01:46:42.646 --> 01:46:45.183
If he shows himself

873
01:46:46.984 --> 01:46:49.441
- are you all right?
- Do you have the map?

874
01:46:49.612 --> 01:46:50.727
We'll find it.

875
01:46:50.905 --> 01:46:53.237
Is your army ready
to fight Santa Anna's?

876
01:46:53.407 --> 01:46:54.885
- No, sir.
- Then why are you asking me

877
01:46:54.909 --> 01:46:56.740
if I'm all right.
Of course I'm not all right.

878
01:46:56.911 --> 01:47:00.351
Now I'm beginning to wonder if you want this
operation to succeed at all, captain love.

879
01:47:00.497 --> 01:47:03.079
- Just what are you saying?
- What I'm saying, captain

880
01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:07.038
is that I think that my horse could
run this army better than you.

881
01:47:11.717 --> 01:47:14.129
I said, I'll find him.

882
01:47:16.013 --> 01:47:17.503
That means I will

883
01:47:20.851 --> 01:47:23.012
Perhaps I can save you the trouble.

884
01:47:23.187 --> 01:47:24.927
(Go on, reach for it, captain.

885
01:47:27.441 --> 01:47:28.476
Who are you?

886
01:47:29.276 --> 01:47:31.688
I warned you long ago, Rafael.

887
01:47:33.447 --> 01:47:35.483
You would never be rid of me.

888
01:47:35.658 --> 01:47:36.864
De la vega.

889
01:47:42.706 --> 01:47:45.823
You are not the Zorro
I saw last night.

890
01:47:46.001 --> 01:47:47.912
That was your master,
Don Alejandro.

891
01:47:48.087 --> 01:47:49.998
Yes

892
01:47:50.339 --> 01:47:53.376
but there are many who would
proudly wear the mask of Zorro.

893
01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:55.711
Either way,
it's of little consequence.

894
01:47:55.886 --> 01:47:58.218
Events have been set in motion
that you cannot stop.

895
01:47:59.223 --> 01:48:01.555
I'm not here to stop you.

896
01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:04.550
Call for Elena.

897
01:48:08.983 --> 01:48:11.065
Call her.

898
01:48:12.987 --> 01:48:16.650
Captain, bring my daughter to me.

899
01:48:18.826 --> 01:48:21.033
Bring her to me!

900
01:48:29.545 --> 01:48:34.380
You cannot imagine, Rafael,
how I have dreamed of this moment.

901
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:38.463
Night and day, 20 long years.

902
01:48:39.054 --> 01:48:43.218
Really? I haven't given you
a second thought.

903
01:48:44.435 --> 01:48:49.270
If I die, de la vega,
the truth dies with me.

904
01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:50.725
We shall see.

905
01:48:50.899 --> 01:48:51.899
Father!

906
01:48:53.318 --> 01:48:55.149
Bernardo, what are you doing?

907
01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:57.185
Tell her, Rafael.

908
01:48:58.907 --> 01:49:00.772
Tell me what? What is going on?

909
01:49:00.951 --> 01:49:03.363
Tell her who her real father is.

910
01:49:04.705 --> 01:49:07.071
Father, what is he saying?

911
01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:13.874
This unfortunate man
lost a daughter once

912
01:49:14.048 --> 01:49:17.211
and it has driven him mad and now
he seeks to claim you for his own.

913
01:49:20.054 --> 01:49:23.262
Tell her how her mother died.

914
01:49:27.102 --> 01:49:30.890
Your daughter is lost, de la vega.

915
01:49:31.065 --> 01:49:32.475
You cannot have mine.

916
01:49:33.067 --> 01:49:34.398
De la vega?

917
01:49:36.612 --> 01:49:39.775
A woman in town, she told me...

918
01:49:40.991 --> 01:49:43.323
Diego de la vega?

919
01:49:46.497 --> 01:49:48.237
Father?

920
01:49:49.374 --> 01:49:51.990
His name is of no consequence.

921
01:49:55.422 --> 01:49:58.710
I was told my nifiera used
to hang something on my crib.

922
01:50:00.469 --> 01:50:03.677
Yes, she had her hang
fresh flowers.

923
01:50:04.431 --> 01:50:06.012
No!

924
01:50:07.184 --> 01:50:08.890
No!

925
01:50:14.024 --> 01:50:16.356
Let us finish it, Rafael.

926
01:50:16.527 --> 01:50:21.021
Let us finish what we started
the night Esperanza died.

927
01:50:21.949 --> 01:50:26.033
Drop your sword, or I will have
no choice but to have you shot.

928
01:50:26.787 --> 01:50:29.620
Even in the presence
of my daughter.

929
01:50:32.543 --> 01:50:34.329
Please.

930
01:50:49.518 --> 01:50:53.557
They were flowers. Romneya.

931
01:50:59.570 --> 01:51:00.570
Rafael

932
01:51:03.699 --> 01:51:04.984
she knows.

933
01:53:14.079 --> 01:53:15.944
Water!

934
01:53:36.059 --> 01:53:38.015
Shh.

935
01:53:50.907 --> 01:53:53.444
Lock them up!

936
01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:50.922
The fuses are burning. Hurry it up.

937
01:54:55.389 --> 01:54:57.050
Let's go!

938
01:55:19.579 --> 01:55:20.989
Wait here!

939
01:55:30.715 --> 01:55:33.377
Secure the wagon, stay alert.

940
01:57:02.682 --> 01:57:03.967
De la vega.

941
01:58:20.176 --> 01:58:21.336
Only one question.

942
01:58:25.932 --> 01:58:28.344
Really”? What is that?

943
01:58:32.897 --> 01:58:34.683
How would you like
your remains displayed?

944
01:58:34.858 --> 01:58:36.519
Ugh!

945
02:00:05.615 --> 02:00:07.947
Now I'm free to kill you.

946
02:00:08.118 --> 02:00:09.118
No!

947
02:00:13.248 --> 02:00:14.704
Oh!

948
02:00:16.209 --> 02:00:18.074
Drop the sword.

949
02:00:18.169 --> 02:00:19.169
Drop it.

950
02:00:29.305 --> 02:00:31.265
You really think
I would have killed my own child?

951
02:00:34.602 --> 02:00:35.933
No!

952
02:00:57.417 --> 02:00:58.417
Did you miss me?

953
02:01:22.525 --> 02:01:25.358
Flenal get them out!

954
02:01:32.076 --> 02:01:35.034
"M" for murrieta.

955
02:01:35.663 --> 02:01:38.575
Two men. One dead

956
02:01:52.222 --> 02:01:54.213
Ah!

957
02:02:40.770 --> 02:02:45.309
You're doing well. Your brother
would have shot himself by now.

958
02:02:49.279 --> 02:02:50.610
Ah!

959
02:03:53.301 --> 02:03:56.919
Ah! Ah! Ah!

960
02:04:13.071 --> 02:04:14.857
Ah!

961
02:04:40.556 --> 02:04:42.592
Alejandro.

962
02:05:58.217 --> 02:06:00.629
Is it finished?

963
02:06:01.137 --> 02:06:03.128
Yes, Don Diego.

964
02:06:03.681 --> 02:06:05.637
It's finished.

965
02:06:07.143 --> 02:06:09.555
Not for Zorro.

966
02:06:09.729 --> 02:06:13.563
There will be other days,
other battles to fight.

967
02:06:13.733 --> 02:06:16.770
It is your curse and destiny.

968
02:06:19.363 --> 02:06:21.524
My beautiful Elena.

969
02:06:24.368 --> 02:06:27.235
The world is a strange place.

970
02:06:28.998 --> 02:06:31.990
To have found you at last,
only to lose you again.

971
02:06:32.168 --> 02:06:34.910
You will never lose me

972
02:06:35.797 --> 02:06:37.628
father.

973
02:06:45.348 --> 02:06:47.680
You are like your mother.

974
02:06:49.018 --> 02:06:51.100
Same eyes.

975
02:06:51.521 --> 02:06:53.682
Same mouth.

976
02:06:54.023 --> 02:06:56.264
Same spirit.

977
02:07:00.988 --> 02:07:03.070
Alejandro...

978
02:07:05.451 --> 02:07:07.442
Flena.

979
02:07:27.431 --> 02:07:29.638
And so it was.

980
02:07:29.809 --> 02:07:32.300
Lightning split the sky.

981
02:07:32.478 --> 02:07:34.810
Thunder shook the air.

982
02:07:34.981 --> 02:07:38.394
And then all was quiet.

983
02:07:39.485 --> 02:07:45.355
The great warrior
known as Zorro was gone.

984
02:07:46.492 --> 02:07:48.983
The people of the land
gave him a hero's funeral.

985
02:07:49.162 --> 02:07:51.448
The largest anyone had ever seen.

986
02:07:52.248 --> 02:07:57.834
They came from far and wide to say farewell
to the brave and noble champion.

987
02:08:01.382 --> 02:08:03.998
But don't worry, little Joaquin.

988
02:08:04.427 --> 02:08:07.260
Whenever great deeds
are remembered

989
02:08:07.471 --> 02:08:10.383
your grandfather will live on.

990
02:08:11.267 --> 02:08:15.010
For there must always be a Zorro.

991
02:08:15.188 --> 02:08:20.524
And someday, when he is needed,
we will see him again.

992
02:08:20.693 --> 02:08:25.608
On his fearsome steed tornado,
riding like the wind.

993
02:08:25.781 --> 02:08:27.942
His sword blazing in the sun.

994
02:08:29.076 --> 02:08:32.284
Leaping, jumping,
swinging through the air.

995
02:08:32.455 --> 02:08:34.946
Fighting like a lion.
Fighting like a tiger!

996
02:08:35.124 --> 02:08:37.115
Fighting...

997
02:08:43.966 --> 02:08:45.706
As safely as possible.

998
02:08:47.637 --> 02:08:50.344
Is this your idea
of putting the baby to sleep?

999
02:08:57.897 --> 02:09:00.309
Sleep tight, my son.

1000
02:09:06.739 --> 02:09:12.530
When I sleep, I will dream
of this dashing rogue, Zorro.

1001
02:09:13.037 --> 02:09:15.995
But what face shall I give him?

1002
02:09:16.749 --> 02:09:19.991
He has been many different men...

1003
02:09:20.169 --> 02:09:23.036
But he has loved you
as all of them

1004
02:09:27.843 --> 02:09:30.755
how can I refuse such a man?

1005
02:09:31.847 --> 02:09:34.759
Do you know where
I might find him?

1006
02:09:35.142 --> 02:09:37.349
You know Zorro.

1007
02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:39.886
He could be anywhere.

1008
02:09:56.455 --> 02:09:59.117
There, there, my darling.
