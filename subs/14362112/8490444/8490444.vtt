00:01:17.552 --> 00:01:20.178

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:21.848
[audience member 1]
We love you, BroZone!

5
00:01:23.057 --> 00:01:25.642
All right, guys. We're gonna
open with "Girl, Baby, Baby"

6
00:01:25.643 --> 00:01:27.728
and close with
"Baby, Baby, Girl."

7
00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.521
Wait, no.
That doesn't sound right. Ooh!

8
00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:31.690
I got it.
Open with "Baby, Baby, Girl,"

9
00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:34.234
close with
"Baby, Baby, Girl, Woman."

10
00:01:34.235 --> 00:01:36.028
Yes! [laughing]

11
00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:38.363
We are gonna make
boy band history tonight.

12
00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:40.824
- [groaning] 510. 511. 512.
- Love it, Brother.

13
00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:43.076
I wanna see a hundred more
of those by showtime, Spruce.

14
00:01:43.077 --> 00:01:45.704
Those abs need
to be poppin', baby.

15
00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:48.165
- Oh! Come on.
- [twinkling]

16
00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:50.334
God, I wanna boil an egg
on those abs.

17
00:01:50.335 --> 00:01:53.712
John Dory, do I really have
to keep wearing these things?

18
00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:56.632
Yes, you do, Clay.
They're funderdrawers.

19
00:01:56.633 --> 00:01:59.134
It's underwear,
but 76% more fun.

20
00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:00.677
Let's see those dance moves, Brother.

21
00:02:00.678 --> 00:02:01.845
Fine.

22
00:02:01.846 --> 00:02:04.097
Rusty Robot, into Wiggle Worm,

23
00:02:04.098 --> 00:02:06.308
end on <i>Caliente</i> Puppet. Yeah.

24
00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:08.601
Bro, you look stressed. Breathe.

25
00:02:08.602 --> 00:02:10.521
Well, of course I'm stressed, Floyd.

26
00:02:10.522 --> 00:02:12.147
It's the first show of the tour.

27
00:02:12.148 --> 00:02:14.525
We have to hit
the perfect family harmony.

28
00:02:14.526 --> 00:02:17.110
- We promised the fans.
- Okay, calm down.

29
00:02:17.111 --> 00:02:18.862
You're making
Baby Branch nervous.

30
00:02:18.863 --> 00:02:20.364
[crowd chanting]
BroZone! BroZone!

31
00:02:20.365 --> 00:02:21.365
[John Dory] What? Nervous?

32
00:02:21.366 --> 00:02:22.908
No, no, no.

33
00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.159
He's not allowed to be nervous.

34
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.410
He's gotta be perfect.

35
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:28.038
Cut him some slack, John Dory.
It's his first show.

36
00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:29.165
[grunting] Come on, abs.

37
00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:31.875
Hey, Branch. How you feeling?

38
00:02:31.876 --> 00:02:35.254
I feel like I'm gonna barf
and pass out and...

39
00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:36.421
Pee your pants all at once?

40
00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:37.589
How'd you know?

41
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.049
Ah,
you got the pre-show jitters.

42
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.133
Completely normal.

43
00:02:40.134 --> 00:02:43.263
Everyone gets 'em. You wanna
know what I do when I get 'em?

44
00:02:44.305 --> 00:02:46.098
Barf, pass out
and pee your pants?

45
00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.141
[chuckles] I remember
that I'm with my brothers,

46
00:02:48.142 --> 00:02:49.685
and that when we come together,

47
00:02:49.686 --> 00:02:51.728
there is nothing
that we can't do.

48
00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:54.898
But no one's ever hit the
perfect family harmony before.

49
00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:57.609
Is it true
it can shatter diamonds?

50
00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.528
Yeah. It's that powerful.

51
00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:00.612
All right, boys, just remember,

52
00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:02.948
no matter what you do,
follow my lead.

53
00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:04.116
Or maybe,

54
00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:05.868
let's just go out there
and have fun together.

55
00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.537
It's just so much pressure.
[gulps]

56
00:03:08.538 --> 00:03:09.663
Ten seconds!

57
00:03:09.664 --> 00:03:12.124
A-And what happens
if we can't hit it?

58
00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:13.333
Oh, that's not an option.

59
00:03:13.334 --> 00:03:14.960
If we can't hit
the perfect family harmony,

60
00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:16.211
we aren't perfect.

61
00:03:16.212 --> 00:03:18.589
And if we aren't perfect,
we're nothing.

62
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.133
Just follow my lead,
and the harmony will happen.

that is exactly what happens

00:06:18.686 --> 00:06:20.687
and now there's only
one direction for us to go:

Not forever.
I'll be back. I promise.

But right now, I...

I have to follow my heart.

It's telling me that it's time
to start a solo career.

But what am I gonna do?

150
00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:41.000
Branch, you are gonna do the
most important thing of all.

But I won't let you win,

155
00:06:50.802 --> 00:06:52.929
because I play for the money.

156
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.597

we'll make our hideout.

346
00:14:39.854 --> 00:14:41.480
[sighing] You're right.
Totally rude of me.

347
00:14:41.481 --> 00:14:42.856
Didn't introduce myself.

348
00:14:42.857 --> 00:14:45.067
[grunting]
I'm Branch's brother.

349
00:14:45.068 --> 00:14:46.236
- [crowd gasping]
- What?

350
00:14:48.279 --> 00:14:50.781
Ooh, drama! Corn me, Dinkles.

351
00:14:50.782 --> 00:14:51.866
[squeaks]

352
00:14:52.951 --> 00:14:54.034
Correction:

353
00:14:54.035 --> 00:14:56.161
Used to be my brother.
Not anymore.

354
00:14:56.162 --> 00:14:58.288
Hey, um, remember earlier

355
00:14:58.289 --> 00:15:00.499
when I said you should open up
to me and be real?

356
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.417
Well...

357
00:15:01.418 --> 00:15:02.584
You could've started
by telling me

358
00:15:02.585 --> 00:15:03.752
you had a secret brother!

359
00:15:03.753 --> 00:15:06.213
- Former brother.
- That's not how DNA works!

360
00:15:06.214 --> 00:15:07.422
Dad, did you know about this?

361
00:15:07.423 --> 00:15:11.343
Huh? What would I know
about secret family members?

362
00:15:11.344 --> 00:15:13.303
[chuckles]

363
00:15:13.304 --> 00:15:15.055
Oh, my gosh.
I was being so rude.

364
00:15:15.056 --> 00:15:16.849
I've never met anyone
from Branch's family before.

365
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.058
I'm Poppy, Branch's girlfriend.

366
00:15:18.059 --> 00:15:20.018
Should we hug, fist-bump,
smile and wave for now

367
00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:21.478
and see where
the night takes us?

368
00:15:21.479 --> 00:15:22.855
All of the above. [chuckles]

369
00:15:22.856 --> 00:15:24.022
Wait, I know you.

370
00:15:24.023 --> 00:15:25.691
You're the guy from BroZone!

371
00:15:25.692 --> 00:15:27.401
We were just listening to them.

372
00:15:27.402 --> 00:15:28.652
Yeah, BroZone!

373
00:15:28.653 --> 00:15:30.404
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Don't tell me, um...

374
00:15:30.405 --> 00:15:31.780
Okay, well,
you're not the heartthrob.

375
00:15:31.781 --> 00:15:33.073
Well, that's your opinion. I...

376
00:15:33.074 --> 00:15:34.449
The fun one?
No, you're kind of uptight.

377
00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:35.492
Uptight?

378
00:15:35.493 --> 00:15:36.952
Hmm.
Not the sensitive one either.

379
00:15:36.953 --> 00:15:38.287
Okay, a lot of assumptions

380
00:15:38.288 --> 00:15:40.038
for someone
you just met 30 seconds ago...

381
00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:42.374
Oh, oh! I've got it.
You're John Dory.

382
00:15:42.375 --> 00:15:43.750
- The leader.
- The old one!

383
00:15:43.751 --> 00:15:45.085
[sighs]

384
00:15:45.086 --> 00:15:47.838
Uh, sorry to interrupt, but we
lose the venue at 11:00, so...

385
00:15:47.839 --> 00:15:50.090
Shh, I'm trying to listen.
Very hot gossip.

386
00:15:50.091 --> 00:15:54.011
So, if... if you're
Branch's bro, then that means

387
00:15:54.012 --> 00:15:55.679
that all the other BroZone bros

388
00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.681
are Branch's bros too.

389
00:15:57.682 --> 00:16:00.851
[gasping] Branch,
how come you never told me?

390
00:16:00.852 --> 00:16:02.227
Because it's complicated.

391
00:16:02.228 --> 00:16:03.520
Oh, sweetie.

392
00:16:03.521 --> 00:16:06.106
'Cause you weren't in the band.

393
00:16:06.107 --> 00:16:07.900
Branch was in the band
all right.

394
00:16:07.901 --> 00:16:09.776
What? No way.
Which one was he?

395
00:16:09.777 --> 00:16:11.737
- Bitty B.
- Bitty B?

396
00:16:11.738 --> 00:16:13.030
No, that's impossible.

397
00:16:13.031 --> 00:16:14.948
- Bitty B had glasses.
- Oh, and a diaper.

398
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:19.119
[harmonizing]
And a falsetto made of gold.

399
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.370
Not that anyone cared.

400
00:16:20.371 --> 00:16:21.705
But that's all in the past.

401
00:16:21.706 --> 00:16:23.373
Because they stopped
being my brothers

402
00:16:23.374 --> 00:16:26.084
the day they walked out on me
and never came back.

403
00:16:26.085 --> 00:16:28.003
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's not fair, Branch.

404
00:16:28.004 --> 00:16:29.963
I did come back,
but no one was there.

405
00:16:29.964 --> 00:16:31.924
It wasn't until I heard about
you saving the world

406
00:16:31.925 --> 00:16:33.342
from the rock apocalypse

407
00:16:33.343 --> 00:16:35.344
that I realized
you were even still alive.

408
00:16:35.345 --> 00:16:36.929
Oh, that's... That's so sweet.

409
00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.388
He realized I was still alive.

410
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:39.598
Twenty years too late!

411
00:16:39.599 --> 00:16:41.850
Hi. Sorry. He gets hangry
if he skips breakfast.

412
00:16:41.851 --> 00:16:43.602
I had breakfast.

413
00:16:43.603 --> 00:16:45.646
It was avocado toast
with two poached eggs,

414
00:16:45.647 --> 00:16:47.064
some cayenne for a little kick.

415
00:16:47.065 --> 00:16:48.565
And you know what?
It was delightful.

416
00:16:48.566 --> 00:16:50.275
Branch,
what's going on with you?

417
00:16:50.276 --> 00:16:51.944
The question
we should be asking is,

418
00:16:51.945 --> 00:16:53.487
what's going on with him?

419
00:16:53.488 --> 00:16:55.614
I bet you he's only here
because he needs something.

420
00:16:55.615 --> 00:16:57.533
That's not true.
He's your brother.

421
00:16:57.534 --> 00:16:59.535
Branch, I'm gonna be straight
with you. I need something.

422
00:16:59.536 --> 00:17:00.702
And there it is.

423
00:17:00.703 --> 00:17:02.204
Come on, man. I'm trying here.

424
00:17:02.205 --> 00:17:03.456
Wait... Wait. Hold up, Branch.

425
00:17:04.164 --> 00:17:05.208
It's about Floyd.

426
00:17:05.874 --> 00:17:06.959
What do you mean?

427
00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.378
He's in danger, man.

428
00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:13.422
<i>I hadn't heard from him
since the band broke up.</i>

429
00:17:13.423 --> 00:17:16.219
[babbling, spits]

430
00:17:17.095 --> 00:17:18.513
- <i>Until...</i>
- [thuds]

431
00:17:21.181 --> 00:17:22.851
<i>I got a letter from him.</i>

432
00:17:23.768 --> 00:17:25.102

<i>Love, Floyd."</i>

437
00:17:35.697 --> 00:17:37.489
<i>I didn't know
where any of you were,</i>

438
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.492

[groans]

454
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:54.817
Yo, Floyd!

455
00:18:55.818 --> 00:18:58.612
John Dory? I can't believe it.

456
00:18:58.613 --> 00:19:00.906
I never thought I'd see
any of my brothers again.

457
00:19:00.907 --> 00:19:02.282
I'm gonna get you
out of here, bro.

458
00:19:02.283 --> 00:19:04.993
No, you've gotta get out
of here. You don't understand.

459
00:19:04.994 --> 00:19:06.411
Velvet and Veneer are giant,

460
00:19:06.412 --> 00:19:07.746
pop-obsessed succubi
with no talent,

461
00:19:07.747 --> 00:19:09.373
and they've been stealing mine.

462
00:19:09.374 --> 00:19:11.041
And they'll be back
any minute for more.

463
00:19:11.042 --> 00:19:13.502
What? That's even worse
than lip-synching.

464
00:19:13.503 --> 00:19:15.296
Not my brother. Not today.

465
00:19:15.964 --> 00:19:17.382
[grunting]

466
00:19:23.221 --> 00:19:24.389
John. John. Stop.

467
00:19:25.056 --> 00:19:26.431
The bottle is made of diamond.

468
00:19:26.432 --> 00:19:27.808
And there's only one thing

469
00:19:27.809 --> 00:19:29.894
that's powerful enough
to shatter diamond.

470
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.689
Right. A diamond-shattering
diamond hammer.

471
00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:35.524
Where can we get one of those?

472
00:19:35.525 --> 00:19:36.775
No, John.

473
00:19:36.776 --> 00:19:39.319
It's the perfect family harmony.

474
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.363
[gasping] Of course.

475
00:19:41.364 --> 00:19:43.533
The perfect family harmony.

476
00:19:44.576 --> 00:19:46.618
[Velvet]
Our voices sound like garbage.

477
00:19:46.619 --> 00:19:48.787
We are dying out there.
[groans]

478
00:19:48.788 --> 00:19:50.706
What we need is more troll.

479
00:19:50.707 --> 00:19:53.083
Run, John Dory. Save yourself.

480
00:19:53.084 --> 00:19:56.211
[grunting] Don't worry, Floyd.
I'll be back with the bros.

481
00:19:56.212 --> 00:19:57.589
You have my word.

482
00:20:00.675 --> 00:20:01.717
Floyd.

483
00:20:01.718 --> 00:20:03.844
So, you came here
to get the band back together

484
00:20:03.845 --> 00:20:05.387
and sing
the perfect family harmony.

485
00:20:05.388 --> 00:20:06.680
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

486
00:20:06.681 --> 00:20:07.973
So we can attempt to sing something

487
00:20:07.974 --> 00:20:09.057
we've only tried once

488
00:20:09.058 --> 00:20:11.185
and failed so miserably at
that we broke up

489
00:20:11.186 --> 00:20:12.644
and never talked
to each other again.

490
00:20:12.645 --> 00:20:15.564
- We are so in.
- What? Uh...

491
00:20:15.565 --> 00:20:17.900
Could you give us a second?

492
00:20:17.901 --> 00:20:18.942
Huh?

493
00:20:18.943 --> 00:20:21.320
Okay, what are you doing?

494
00:20:21.321 --> 00:20:23.614
This is your second chance
with your brothers, Branch.

495
00:20:23.615 --> 00:20:26.158
[sighs]
It's not that easy, okay?

496
00:20:26.159 --> 00:20:28.076
You don't get it.
You don't have any siblings.

497
00:20:28.077 --> 00:20:29.244
That's my point.

498
00:20:29.245 --> 00:20:32.372
Branch, you are so lucky to
have a brother to fight for.

499
00:20:32.373 --> 00:20:34.208
I mean, if I had a sister...
[gasps]

500
00:20:34.209 --> 00:20:35.375
...it would be so perfect.

501
00:20:35.376 --> 00:20:37.127
We'd be best friends and
we'd teach each other things.

502
00:20:37.128 --> 00:20:38.670
We'd never fight,
we'd have each other's backs.

503
00:20:38.671 --> 00:20:40.380
We wouldn't talk 'cause we'd
think the same thoughts.

504
00:20:40.381 --> 00:20:41.632
Everyone would ask us
if we're twins,

505
00:20:41.633 --> 00:20:43.800
and we'd be like,
"Well, not technically"...

506
00:20:43.801 --> 00:20:45.511
- Poppy.
- But...

507
00:20:46.512 --> 00:20:48.472
if she were ever in trouble,

508
00:20:48.473 --> 00:20:51.058
I would do everything I could
to help her.

509
00:20:51.059 --> 00:20:52.726
I would show up.

510
00:20:52.727 --> 00:20:54.603
[sighs] Okay, listen.

511
00:20:54.604 --> 00:20:57.606
If there was a brother
that I might do this for,

512
00:20:57.607 --> 00:20:59.108
and I'm not saying there is,

513
00:21:00.193 --> 00:21:01.152
it would be Floyd.

514
00:21:01.153 --> 00:21:02.736
I'm not hearing "no."

515
00:21:02.737 --> 00:21:04.404
- Yes! Works for me.
- Yeah!

516
00:21:04.405 --> 00:21:05.697
BroZone 2.0.

517
00:21:05.698 --> 00:21:07.866
BroZone reunion.

I mean, maybe like
a desperate Christmas album

or a one-off
national anthem performance,

603
00:24:13.052 --> 00:24:14.261

kiss our careers goodbye

- He's fine.
- And he's getting pale.

620
00:24:53.593 --> 00:24:56.512
And not in like a stunning,
Victorian way.

what you're doing?

on this troll

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.186
Listen, baby brother,

693
00:27:51.187 --> 00:27:53.438
we don't need your little
board to find Spruce...

694
00:27:53.439 --> 00:27:55.691
- It's not little.
- ...because I got this!

695
00:27:55.692 --> 00:27:57.317
Ha! Booyah.

696
00:27:57.318 --> 00:27:59.987
A postcard that says,
"Wish you were here"?

697
00:27:59.988 --> 00:28:01.655
That's it?
It's not even signed.

698
00:28:01.656 --> 00:28:03.240
It's definitely Spruce.

699
00:28:03.241 --> 00:28:06.201
I mean, he's the only one
I know who talks that way.

700
00:28:06.202 --> 00:28:08.871
There's no return address.
It's blank.

701
00:28:08.872 --> 00:28:10.247
This could be from anywhere.

702
00:28:10.248 --> 00:28:12.040
We can't find Spruce with this.

703
00:28:12.041 --> 00:28:13.250
Yeah, we can!

704
00:28:13.251 --> 00:28:15.294
All we have to do
is find this sunset.

705
00:28:15.295 --> 00:28:17.337
Liking that optimism,
Poppy seed.

706
00:28:17.338 --> 00:28:20.048
- Branch, one word. Keeper!
- [groans]

707
00:28:20.049 --> 00:28:23.051
Hey, man. I know about
being treated like a baby.

708
00:28:23.052 --> 00:28:25.053
But while it's just
the two of us,

709
00:28:25.054 --> 00:28:26.805
- you want some of this?
- Nah.

710
00:28:26.806 --> 00:28:29.183
Thanks, man. I-I can't
get back on that train.

711
00:28:29.184 --> 00:28:30.350
Suit yourself.

712
00:28:30.351 --> 00:28:31.727
I mean, hey, look at this.

713
00:28:31.728 --> 00:28:33.854
We're never gonna
find Spruce with this.

714
00:28:33.855 --> 00:28:35.940
I bet this sunset
doesn't even exist.

715
00:28:37.275 --> 00:28:38.901
[Tiny Diamond] Oh, hot dog!

716
00:28:38.902 --> 00:28:40.319
Oh, man.

717
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.653
Of course.

718
00:28:41.654 --> 00:28:44.406
Hey, guys!
You're gonna want to see this.

719
00:28:44.407 --> 00:28:46.158
- I knew we'd find it.
- [laughs]

720
00:28:46.159 --> 00:28:47.743
Spruce must be on that island.

721
00:28:47.744 --> 00:28:49.369
Whoa, easy there, goggles.

722
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:51.413
All right, y'all.
Let's mobilize!

723
00:28:51.414 --> 00:28:53.041
Yeah, pedal to the metal, JD.

724
00:28:56.502 --> 00:28:58.629
- What are you doing?
- Worry not, friends.

725
00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:01.341
Rhonda here's
completely waterproof.

726
00:29:02.091 --> 00:29:03.593
[Rhonda groans]

727
00:29:04.636 --> 00:29:06.011
[all scream]

728
00:29:06.012 --> 00:29:08.890
[screaming continues]

729
00:29:09.724 --> 00:29:10.725
{\an8}[splashes]

730
00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.360
Oh, Grissy,

731
00:29:21.361 --> 00:29:25.280
this is the most romantic
honeymoon I've ever been on.

732
00:29:25.281 --> 00:29:26.281
Ever.

733
00:29:26.282 --> 00:29:28.617
Whoo!
It is a night of surprises!

734
00:29:28.618 --> 00:29:30.912
- [engine revs]
- [King Gristle exclaims]

735
00:29:32.622 --> 00:29:35.333
To the water park! Whoo-hoo!

736
00:29:39.003 --> 00:29:41.005
[groaning]

737
00:29:42.257 --> 00:29:44.758
[Branch coughing, panting]

738
00:29:44.759 --> 00:29:46.093
Good old Rhonda.

739
00:29:46.094 --> 00:29:48.887
- Completely waterproof, huh?
- [Rhonda groans]

740
00:29:48.888 --> 00:29:49.972
So, John Dory,

741
00:29:49.973 --> 00:29:51.640
who wrote that song "Girl,
I Love Your Love, Girl"?

742
00:29:51.641 --> 00:29:52.850
- I did.
- Cool.

743
00:29:52.851 --> 00:29:54.309
Who wrote, "Girl,
You Break My Heart, Girl"?

744
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:56.061
- I did.
- So cool.

745
00:29:56.062 --> 00:29:57.563
Who wrote,
"Girl, I Love Your Love, Girl,

746
00:29:57.564 --> 00:29:59.064
You Break My Heart, Girl,
I Still Love You,

747
00:29:59.065 --> 00:30:00.482
But I Seriously Think
We Should Have A Talk

748
00:30:00.483 --> 00:30:01.650
About Our Relationship, Girl"?

749
00:30:01.651 --> 00:30:02.943
- That was Branch.
- Shut up!

750
00:30:02.944 --> 00:30:04.570
That was my favorite
BroZone song, like, ever.

751
00:30:04.571 --> 00:30:07.155
JK! Also me. [laughs]

752
00:30:07.156 --> 00:30:08.657
Branch has never written a song.

753
00:30:08.658 --> 00:30:09.908
I was a baby.

754
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:11.910
What did you want me
to write about, diaper rash?

755
00:30:11.911 --> 00:30:14.414
Okay, take it easy, Bitty B.

756
00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:17.291
- [Branch groans]
- Hey, what's wrong?

757
00:30:17.292 --> 00:30:18.625
Nothing. Super happy.

758
00:30:18.626 --> 00:30:20.795
This is our most
fun mission yet. Yay.

759
00:30:21.504 --> 00:30:23.839
Branch, do you know
how lucky you are?

760
00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.924
A brother is a friend
who can never leave you.

761
00:30:25.925 --> 00:30:27.593
It's the strongest bond
in the world.

762
00:30:27.594 --> 00:30:30.178
I would kill to have a sibling
to sing with, Branch.

763
00:30:30.179 --> 00:30:32.890
Ha! Yeah, well,
you can have mine.

764
00:30:32.891 --> 00:30:34.058
Okay. Fine.

765
00:30:35.018 --> 00:30:36.476
Poppy, wait.

766
00:30:36.477 --> 00:30:37.477
[sighs]

767
00:30:37.478 --> 00:30:40.397
Grown-up stuff. Am I right?
[chuckles]

768
00:30:40.398 --> 00:30:42.608
You know, I've still got
that thang, if you want it.

769
00:30:42.609 --> 00:30:44.986
Whoa, whoa. Don't be
waving that thing around.

770
00:30:46.613 --> 00:30:47.572
All right, y'all.

771
00:30:47.573 --> 00:30:49.573
We're getting close
to something.

772
00:30:49.574 --> 00:30:51.159
I can feel it. [gasps]

773
00:30:52.452 --> 00:30:53.785
- [all scream]
- [chuckling] Whoa.

774
00:30:53.786 --> 00:30:55.204
What do we got here?

775
00:30:55.205 --> 00:30:58.166
Hey, guys. Looks like I found
some fellow rock climbers.

776
00:30:59.167 --> 00:31:01.627
- Hi!

Running drinks
to the back two-top.

795
00:32:08.152 --> 00:32:10.237
Lenny! Seaweed floats
are almost out.

796
00:32:10.238 --> 00:32:11.155
Thanks, boss.

797
00:32:11.156 --> 00:32:13.031
Hey, yo, Spruce! Spruce! Hey!

798
00:32:13.032 --> 00:32:14.116
Specials are on the back.

00:32:14.117 --> 00:32:15.617
Don't order the clams.
Don't ask why.

800
00:32:15.618 --> 00:32:17.911
Fricassee squid
and one jellyfish slider.

801
00:32:17.912 --> 00:32:18.996
Spruce, wait.

802
00:32:18.997 --> 00:32:21.290
Huh? Oh, no. I knew
this would happen one day.

803
00:32:21.291 --> 00:32:23.250
Listen, I know you recognize
me from BroZone,

804
00:32:23.251 --> 00:32:25.335
and I'm happy to give you
an autograph or whatever.

805
00:32:25.336 --> 00:32:27.004
But can you please
be discreet about it?

806
00:32:27.005 --> 00:32:29.131
Spruce, it's us.
It's your brothers.

807
00:32:29.132 --> 00:32:31.967
- Whoa. Bitty B?
- What?

808
00:32:31.968 --> 00:32:33.719
- [growls, laughs]
- Whoa! [chuckles]

809
00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.221
No tossing, okay? [stammers]
Too big to be tossed.

810
00:32:36.222 --> 00:32:38.807
The last time I saw you,
you were in diapers. [laughs]

811
00:32:38.808 --> 00:32:40.184
Diapers. Right.

812
00:32:40.185 --> 00:32:41.393
Wet willy! [grunting]

813
00:32:41.394 --> 00:32:43.270
Stop it. That's disgusting.

814
00:32:43.271 --> 00:32:45.522
- I am a grown-up.
- Oh, sorry.

815
00:32:45.523 --> 00:32:46.732
A wet William.

816
00:32:46.733 --> 00:32:47.816
Hi, Spruce. I'm Poppy.

817
00:32:47.817 --> 00:32:50.444
Wow. It's, like... It's so cool
to meet you or whatever.

818
00:32:50.445 --> 00:32:51.486
This is Tiny Diamond.

819
00:32:51.487 --> 00:32:52.613
[Tiny Diamond] Hey, what's up?

820
00:32:52.614 --> 00:32:54.698
Killer nachos you got here,
by the way.

821
00:32:54.699 --> 00:32:56.533
- Yeah!
- All right!

822
00:32:56.534 --> 00:32:58.452
Okay, Spruce.
We're here because Floyd...

823
00:32:58.453 --> 00:33:01.038
No one's called me Spruce
in years. I go by Bruce now.

824
00:33:01.039 --> 00:33:02.372
I'm sorry. Did you say Bruce?

825
00:33:02.373 --> 00:33:05.626
Yeah. I wanted to put the
whole boy band thing behind me

826
00:33:05.627 --> 00:33:06.793
now that I'm a dad.

827
00:33:06.794 --> 00:33:08.754
Wait a minute.
You're a father?

828
00:33:08.755 --> 00:33:11.632
Yeah. I can't wait
for you to meet everyone.

829
00:33:11.633 --> 00:33:14.384
Hi, honey. These are
my brothers, unexpectedly.

830
00:33:14.385 --> 00:33:18.722
Oh. Oh! Oh, hello there.
So nice to finally meet you.

831
00:33:18.723 --> 00:33:19.973
- Hi!
- Hello.

832
00:33:19.974 --> 00:33:22.434
This is my wife
and business partner, Brandy.

833
00:33:22.435 --> 00:33:24.019
She is my soulmate.

834
00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.854
My very tall soulmate.

835
00:33:25.855 --> 00:33:27.272
But we make it work.

836
00:33:27.273 --> 00:33:28.607
How?

837
00:33:28.608 --> 00:33:30.359
We don't even really know
how it works.

838
00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.736
[chuckles] I'm kidding. I'm...
I'm not. I'm... I don't know.

839
00:33:32.737 --> 00:33:34.363
Daddy, Daddy,
can I have a cookie?

840
00:33:34.364 --> 00:33:35.697
Becoming a dad was like a...

841
00:33:35.698 --> 00:33:37.491
like a seismic shift
in my brain.

842
00:33:37.492 --> 00:33:39.409
- Daddy, Bruce Jr. bit me.
- No biting.

843
00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:41.995
Daddy, I don't see how any
government stands a chance.

844
00:33:41.996 --> 00:33:43.121
You're not wrong, kid.

845
00:33:43.122 --> 00:33:44.665
I'm stuck
in this ketchup bottle.

846
00:33:44.666 --> 00:33:45.999
Okay.
Gonna handle all of that.

847
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.752
Just give Daddy two seconds,
okay? Love you.

848
00:33:48.753 --> 00:33:49.836
As a dad...

849
00:33:49.837 --> 00:33:50.921
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!
Guess what?

850
00:33:50.922 --> 00:33:52.256
I have pink eye.

851
00:33:52.257 --> 00:33:53.799
Oh, my... Pink eye.

852
00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:54.925
Oh, [bleep]

853
00:33:54.926 --> 00:33:56.510
Look, Spruce,
gotta cut to the chase.

854
00:33:56.511 --> 00:33:58.554
We're not here to catch up.
We're here because we need

855
00:33:58.555 --> 00:34:00.347
to hit
the perfect family harmony.

856
00:34:00.348 --> 00:34:02.558
Oh, no. You're still
going on about that?

857
00:34:02.559 --> 00:34:04.977
Hey. Get these guys
their meals to go.

858
00:34:04.978 --> 00:34:06.645
No, no, no.
You don't understand.

859
00:34:06.646 --> 00:34:09.022
It's for Floyd.
He's being held captive.

860
00:34:09.023 --> 00:34:10.857
What? Well, then,
what are we waiting for?

861
00:34:10.858 --> 00:34:12.109
We need to call the authorities.

862
00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:13.609

been paying attention.

1203
00:47:06.843 --> 00:47:09.052
Well, why haven't you
just called the authorities?

1204
00:47:09.053 --> 00:47:11.597
Oh, unless Floyd is being held

1205
00:47:11.598 --> 00:47:13.724
in an impenetrable
diamond prison.

1206
00:47:13.725 --> 00:47:16.268
- Yeah. That.
- I'm in.

1207
00:47:16.269 --> 00:47:18.854
I'd also like to volunteer to
keep track of our expenses.

1208
00:47:18.855 --> 00:47:20.522
Just 'cause I think
you're gonna need somebody

1209
00:47:20.523 --> 00:47:21.690
to be on top of that.

1210
00:47:21.691 --> 00:47:24.359
Yeah, I don't think you'll get
any pushback on that front.

1211
00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.279
Great, but we need to leave
for Mount Rageous, like, now.

1212
00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.323
You can't leave now.
You just got here.

1213
00:47:29.324 --> 00:47:30.657
Come on.
Let me show you around.

1214
00:47:30.658 --> 00:47:32.869
- [grunts]
- Hug time!

1215
00:47:33.536 --> 00:47:35.246
- Uh...
- Yeah, no.

1216
00:47:35.914 --> 00:47:38.665
Aw, so cute. Where'd you get
that hug time bracelet?

1217
00:47:38.666 --> 00:47:40.083
My dad gave it to me.

1218
00:47:40.084 --> 00:47:42.920
Okay, this is so totally random,

1219
00:47:42.921 --> 00:47:44.963
but I used to have one
just like it.

1220
00:47:44.964 --> 00:47:46.132
Can I see that?

1221
00:47:47.008 --> 00:47:48.509
Wow. It fits you perfectly.

1222
00:47:49.219 --> 00:47:50.303
Yeah.

1223
00:47:56.601 --> 00:47:58.602
- Whoa.
- [chuckles]

1224
00:47:58.603 --> 00:47:59.937
I'm sorry.

1225
00:47:59.938 --> 00:48:01.813
What did you say
your name was again?

1226
00:48:01.814 --> 00:48:03.107
I'm Poppy.

1227
00:48:04.359 --> 00:48:05.276
Poppy?

1228
00:48:16.079 --> 00:48:19.331
Okay, um, another totally
random, weird question,

1229
00:48:19.332 --> 00:48:22.919
but is your dad King Peppy?

1230
00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.880
Uh, yeah? [chuckles]

1231
00:48:26.548 --> 00:48:27.673
You're...

1232
00:48:27.674 --> 00:48:29.174
Oh, you're... you're alive.

1233
00:48:29.175 --> 00:48:31.760
- I'm alive.
- This is unbelievable!

1234
00:48:31.761 --> 00:48:33.554
I never thought
I'd see you again.

1235
00:48:33.555 --> 00:48:34.472
Again?

1236
00:48:34.473 --> 00:48:36.306
Poppy, it's me, Viva.

1237
00:48:36.307 --> 00:48:37.433
Uh...

1238
00:48:38.101 --> 00:48:39.101
I'm your sister.

1239
00:48:39.102 --> 00:48:41.019
My... My what?

1240
00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:43.105
Your sister. Your <i>hermana</i>!

1241
00:48:43.106 --> 00:48:44.231
Whoa.

1242
00:48:44.232 --> 00:48:47.109
Hey, man. Am I the only one
without a long-lost sibling?

1243
00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:48.652
What do you mean, we're sisters?

1244
00:48:48.653 --> 00:48:49.945
H-How could I have
not known about you?

1245
00:48:49.946 --> 00:48:52.197
I can't believe Dad didn't
tell me I have a sister.

1246
00:48:52.198 --> 00:48:53.657
- That is...
- [in unison] ...so Dad.

1247
00:48:53.658 --> 00:48:55.367
Oh! I ca...
I can't believe this.

1248
00:48:55.368 --> 00:48:56.785
I've always dreamt
of having a sister.

1249
00:48:56.786 --> 00:48:58.537
I was just saying this.
Wasn't I just saying this?

1250
00:48:58.538 --> 00:49:00.414
This means we can plan
each other's birthday parties.

1251
00:49:00.415 --> 00:49:01.623
- Yeah! And weddings.
- Yes!

1252
00:49:01.624 --> 00:49:02.708
My best friend had her wedding,

1253
00:49:02.709 --> 00:49:03.834
and it went off without a hitch.

1254
00:49:03.835 --> 00:49:04.918
I was the best maid of honor.

1255
00:49:04.919 --> 00:49:06.461
You'd be the best maid of honor.

1256
00:49:06.462 --> 00:49:07.838
You and Bridget
are gonna love each other!

1257
00:49:07.839 --> 00:49:08.922
I'm gonna love her.

1258
00:49:08.923 --> 00:49:10.465
- I love what you love.
- Yes! [screams]

1259
00:49:10.466 --> 00:49:11.675

[Poppy, Viva giggling]

1296
00:50:39.597 --> 00:50:41.557
So I was thinking
about getting more into, like,

1297
00:50:41.558 --> 00:50:43.809
reading short stories and
essays instead of full novels.

1298
00:50:43.810 --> 00:50:46.270
- Ooh, I love that for you.
- Yeah.

1299
00:50:46.271 --> 00:50:48.939
But, um... But just
to circle back real quick.

1300
00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:51.692
I still have a million
questions about what happened.

1301
00:50:51.693 --> 00:50:52.985
I used to live
at the Troll Tree.

1302
00:50:52.986 --> 00:50:54.194
I was there when you were born.

1303
00:50:54.195 --> 00:50:55.529
And you were so cute.

1304
00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:58.407
Kinda like you are now, only
teensier and weensier and...

1305
00:50:58.408 --> 00:50:59.325
[gasps]

1306
00:50:59.326 --> 00:51:01.285
Do you wanna make candy
necklaces that we never finish

1307
00:51:01.286 --> 00:51:03.579
- because we eat all the candy?
- Obviously!

1308
00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:06.957
But, Veev, I'm just gonna need
you to focus here and...

1309
00:51:06.958 --> 00:51:08.458
and tell me everything.

1310
00:51:08.459 --> 00:51:10.377
Why am I only learning
about you now?

1311
00:51:10.378 --> 00:51:12.045
What happened?

1312
00:51:12.046 --> 00:51:14.590
[in robot voice]
We got accidentally separated.

1313
00:51:14.591 --> 00:51:16.550
[normal voice] And I've lived
here ever since. The end.

1314
00:51:16.551 --> 00:51:18.343
Wanna do candy toe rings next?

1315
00:51:18.344 --> 00:51:20.888
Uh, accidentally separated?

1316
00:51:20.889 --> 00:51:23.056
Viva doesn't like
to talk about it.

1317
00:51:23.057 --> 00:51:24.391
It's too painful for her.

1318
00:51:24.392 --> 00:51:25.726
But she's been here ever since

1319
00:51:25.727 --> 00:51:27.060
the night
of the great Bergen attack.

1320
00:51:27.061 --> 00:51:28.520
[humming]

1321
00:51:28.521 --> 00:51:30.147
Viva, are you talking
about the night

1322
00:51:30.148 --> 00:51:32.316
the trolls escaped Bergen Town?

1323
00:51:32.317 --> 00:51:33.942
Oh, yeah.

1324
00:51:33.943 --> 00:51:35.652
Yeah, I guess it was that night.

1325
00:51:35.653 --> 00:51:37.529
[humming]

1326
00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:39.782
Not everyone
made it out of that tree.

1327
00:51:40.491 --> 00:51:42.367
Some of them got trapped
by Bergens.

1328
00:51:42.368 --> 00:51:43.869
<i>They were this close
to getting eaten...</i>

1329
00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:44.953
- [squeaking]
- <i>...until Viva</i>

1330
00:51:44.954 --> 00:51:46.955
<i>and some of the other trolls
fought them off.</i>

1331
00:51:46.956 --> 00:51:48.540
[Viva grunting]

1332
00:51:48.541 --> 00:51:49.626
[Clay] <i>But by then...</i>

1333
00:51:50.752 --> 00:51:51.919
the tunnels had collapsed,

1334
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.670
and they were cut off
from the rest.

1335
00:51:53.671 --> 00:51:56.840
I kept screaming,
"No troll left behind!"

1336
00:51:56.841 --> 00:52:00.260
But when I went back in,
the tunnels had collapsed.

1337
00:52:00.261 --> 00:52:03.138
That's when I found
Viva's hug time bracelet.

1338
00:52:03.139 --> 00:52:06.558
Viva found this old,
abandoned Bergen golf course

1339
00:52:06.559 --> 00:52:08.393
and transformed it
into this troll utopia.

1340
00:52:08.394 --> 00:52:11.355
We formed this little
sanctuary of survivors.

1341
00:52:11.356 --> 00:52:12.648
I added fire exits.

1342
00:52:12.649 --> 00:52:14.066
She added her heart and soul.

1343
00:52:14.067 --> 00:52:17.069
I've thought so many times
about leaving, you know,

1344
00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:20.822
to look for you and Dad,
but it's not safe out there.

1345
00:52:20.823 --> 00:52:25.327
I know I should've told Poppy,
but my heart was broken.

1346
00:52:25.328 --> 00:52:27.037
I felt like a failure.

1347
00:52:27.038 --> 00:52:29.790
Not just as a king,
but as a father.

1348
00:52:29.791 --> 00:52:31.291
I feel so guilty.

1349
00:52:31.292 --> 00:52:32.752
What do you think I should do?

1350
00:52:33.711 --> 00:52:35.712
I'm afraid
that's our time for today.

1351
00:52:35.713 --> 00:52:38.174
But I just
revealed a major trauma.

1352
00:52:39.342 --> 00:52:40.260
[squeaks]

1353
00:52:42.053 --> 00:52:44.179
Okay. Obviously this is a lot,

1354
00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:45.764
and you should be able
to open up about this

1355
00:52:45.765 --> 00:52:46.890
on your own time.

1356
00:52:46.891 --> 00:52:48.475
But we'll have plenty of time
to work through this

1357
00:52:48.476 --> 00:52:49.643
on the way to Mount Rageous.

1358
00:52:49.644 --> 00:52:52.396
Whoa! I am not going
to Mount Rageous.

1359
00:52:52.397 --> 00:52:53.814
And neither are you, silly.

1360
00:52:53.815 --> 00:52:55.441
You're never gonna leave again.

1361
00:52:58.778 --> 00:53:01.072
Wait, what was the...
What was that last thing?

1362
00:53:01.739 --> 00:53:03.073
Okay, guys,
if we're gonna save Floyd,

1363
00:53:03.074 --> 00:53:04.366
we need to get going.

1364
00:53:04.367 --> 00:53:05.450
I'll go get Poppy.

1365
00:53:05.451 --> 00:53:07.160
No, no, no, wait. Hold on.

1366
00:53:07.161 --> 00:53:08.912
There's no way
Viva's gonna let her go.

1367
00:53:08.913 --> 00:53:10.831
What?
W-What are you talking about?

1368
00:53:10.832 --> 00:53:13.458
Like I said, she's got
some stuff going on, man.

1369
00:53:13.459 --> 00:53:16.713
If we don't wanna get trapped,

What's up, girl?

1372
00:53:29.309 --> 00:53:31.560
Viva! What are you doing?

1373
00:53:31.561 --> 00:53:34.522
You're not leaving here
no matter what, because...

1374
00:53:35.023 --> 00:53:37.232
because it's just not safe
out there. You're welcome.

Wait, is this about the Bergens?

trying to eat us.

I was telling you about,

00:53:50.413 --> 00:53:52.915

a million fun things together.

and we sing songs.

these really bad dances.

and I have been doing.

than it used to be.

I used to be just like you.

because I knew it was safe.

1393

1395

Don't be a baby, Branch.

1542
00:59:56.654 --> 00:59:57.905
You're mad at him,

1543
00:59:57.906 --> 01:00:00.199
but you guys do
the exact same thing to me.

1544
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.659
You all still treat me like
the baby of the family.

1545
01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:04.077
But guess what?

1546
01:00:04.078 --> 01:00:07.289
I stopped being a baby the day
you guys walked out on me,

1547
01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:08.916
'cause I had to.

1548
01:00:08.917 --> 01:00:10.042
Then Grandma got eaten,

1549
01:00:10.043 --> 01:00:11.835
and there was no one else
to take care of me.

1550
01:00:11.836 --> 01:00:15.006
This time,
I'm walking out on you.

1551
01:00:21.596 --> 01:00:23.223
This is Branch's bunker.

1552
01:00:24.599 --> 01:00:27.393
He built this for you guys.

1553
01:00:29.562 --> 01:00:30.730
I didn't know.

1554
01:00:32.607 --> 01:00:33.900
I guess you never asked.

1555
01:00:36.945 --> 01:00:37.945
Wait.

1556
01:00:37.946 --> 01:00:39.656
Grandma got eaten?

1557
01:00:42.951 --> 01:00:44.160
[Poppy] Branch, wait!

1558
01:00:44.786 --> 01:00:45.786
Branch! [panting]

1559
01:00:45.787 --> 01:00:47.162
Where are you going?

1560
01:00:47.163 --> 01:00:49.498
To save Floyd. Alone.

1561
01:00:49.499 --> 01:00:51.917
I didn't need them growing up,
and I don't need them now.

1562
01:00:51.918 --> 01:00:54.044
What... What are you doing?

1563
01:00:54.045 --> 01:00:55.922
What do you mean?
I'm coming with you.

1564
01:00:56.673 --> 01:00:58.006
[scoffs] Why bother?

1565
01:00:58.007 --> 01:01:00.343
[stammers] Aren't you gonna
leave me eventually anyway?

1566
01:01:00.843 --> 01:01:02.136
Everyone else does.

1567
01:01:07.016 --> 01:01:09.685
I have been by your side
from the moment we met.

1568
01:01:09.686 --> 01:01:11.562
And you've been by mine.

1569
01:01:11.563 --> 01:01:13.647
Let's give each other
some credit here.

1570
01:01:13.648 --> 01:01:15.065
[sighs] Right.

1571
01:01:15.066 --> 01:01:17.151
Uh, I'm sorry. Thank you.

1572
01:01:17.819 --> 01:01:18.820
You're welcome.

1573
01:01:19.654 --> 01:01:20.947
And I'm not going anywhere.

1574
01:01:22.073 --> 01:01:23.283
Unless it's with you.

1575
01:01:24.409 --> 01:01:25.618
To save Floyd.

1576
01:01:28.913 --> 01:01:30.248
[bicycle bell rings]

1577
01:01:31.332 --> 01:01:33.625
Tiny! You're coming too?

1578
01:01:33.626 --> 01:01:34.626
Hey, what can I say?

1579
01:01:34.627 --> 01:01:36.670
I was moved by Branch's speech

1580
01:01:36.671 --> 01:01:39.006
and his sad, sad drawing.

1581
01:01:39.007 --> 01:01:40.216
Now, let's roll.

1582
01:01:42.176 --> 01:01:43.428
[bell rings]

1583
01:01:49.184 --> 01:01:50.225
Wow, Grissy.

1584
01:01:50.226 --> 01:01:51.602
I've never seen anyone

1585
01:01:51.603 --> 01:01:53.478
get kicked out
of a water park like that.

1586
01:01:53.479 --> 01:01:54.646
All right, for the record,

1587
01:01:54.647 --> 01:01:56.565
it was the water slide
that ripped off my trunks.

1588
01:01:56.566 --> 01:01:58.442
Ooh, so hot.

1589
01:01:58.443 --> 01:01:59.526
[sniffing]

1590
01:01:59.527 --> 01:02:01.361
Wait. [sniffing]

1591
01:02:01.362 --> 01:02:02.696
Do you smell...

1592
01:02:02.697 --> 01:02:03.906
[tires screeching]

1593
01:02:03.907 --> 01:02:05.199
French fries!

1594
01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.160
[gasps] French fries.

1595
01:02:11.623 --> 01:02:13.416
[whispering]

1596
01:02:16.794 --> 01:02:18.420
- [King Gristle gasps]
- [Bridget] Ew.

1597
01:02:18.421 --> 01:02:19.630
Who goes there?

1598
01:02:19.631 --> 01:02:21.131
[both scream]

1599
01:02:21.132 --> 01:02:23.426
[chanting] Putt-Putt.
Putt-Putt. Putt-Putt.

1600
01:02:25.637 --> 01:02:27.222
Are those golf balls?

1601
01:02:27.931 --> 01:02:28.848
Putt-Putt.

1602
01:02:28.849 --> 01:02:31.808
Oh, good. They're just trolls.
Look how cute.

1603
01:02:31.809 --> 01:02:32.727
[grunts]

1604
01:02:32.728 --> 01:02:33.895
[both scream]

1605
01:02:35.772 --> 01:02:37.105
What's happening?

1606
01:02:37.106 --> 01:02:39.066
[both] Ow!

1607
01:02:39.067 --> 01:02:40.359
[both grunting]

1608
01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:43.237
Grissy, I didn't think we'd
both find ourselves tied up

1609
01:02:43.238 --> 01:02:44.531
on this honeymoon.

1610
01:02:45.782 --> 01:02:46.823
[grunts]

1611
01:02:46.824 --> 01:02:48.993
[dance music playing]

1612
01:02:51.621 --> 01:02:52.871
[Branch] All right, look.

1613
01:02:52.872 --> 01:02:54.248
Security is really tight.

1614
01:02:54.249 --> 01:02:56.333
So we're not gonna be able
to just walk right in.

1615
01:02:56.334 --> 01:02:58.835
You know what that means.
We're scaling the walls.

1616
01:02:58.836 --> 01:03:00.797
We're huh? Doing what? When?

1617
01:03:01.464 --> 01:03:02.881
[Branch] <i>We should plan
to make our ascent</i>

1618
01:03:02.882 --> 01:03:04.676
<i>about 200 meters east
of the entrance.</i>

1619
01:03:05.843 --> 01:03:07.594
Good thing I brought
extra gummy gloves.

1620
01:03:07.595 --> 01:03:10.013
I'm tired. Carry me.

1621
01:03:10.014 --> 01:03:11.348
You have to walk on your own, Tiny.

1622
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:12.599
You have to be a big boy.

1623
01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.143
But my feet hurt.
I don't wanna.

1624
01:03:15.144 --> 01:03:16.979
[Branch] <i>The quickest way in
will be at the roof.</i>

1625
01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:18.355
The HVAC system.

1626
01:03:18.356 --> 01:03:21.733
- Ooh. I love how you say HVAC.
- Thank you.

1627
01:03:21.734 --> 01:03:24.319
[Branch] But we'll have
to bypass the fan blade,

1628
01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:26.989
so that our cupcakes
don't get sliced in two.

1629
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:29.449
- Ooh! We brought cupcakes?
- No.

1630
01:03:29.450 --> 01:03:31.119
Not what I meant.
It doesn't matter.

1631
01:03:43.298 --> 01:03:44.798
<i>After that,
we need to cut the power,</i>

1632
01:03:44.799 --> 01:03:45.924
<i>so we can move freely</i>

1633
01:03:45.925 --> 01:03:47.551
<i>through the interior air ducts.</i>

1634
01:03:47.552 --> 01:03:49.428
How do you know
which wires to cut?

1635
01:03:49.429 --> 01:03:50.429
I don't.

1636
01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:52.807
I'm just blasting everything
until something turns off.

1637
01:03:54.475 --> 01:03:55.727
Hello?

1638
01:03:56.311 --> 01:03:58.312
[Branch] <i>From there, we'll
have to do some exploring,</i>

1639
01:03:58.313 --> 01:04:00.523
<i>but we'll find Floyd
in one of those rooms.</i>

1640
01:04:01.065 --> 01:04:02.525
Look. There he is.

1641
01:04:06.988 --> 01:04:08.072
[Poppy] Come on.

1642
01:04:11.034 --> 01:04:12.368
Floyd.

1643
01:04:13.578 --> 01:04:15.829
Branch? Is it really you?

1644
01:04:15.830 --> 01:04:16.997
Yeah.

1645
01:04:16.998 --> 01:04:18.416
It's really me.

1646
01:04:19.083 --> 01:04:21.752
[chuckles] Wow. You've
really grown into that vest.

1647
01:04:21.753 --> 01:04:23.087
You're a man now.

1648
01:04:23.755 --> 01:04:26.799
Oh! Finally, somebody gets me.

1649
01:04:29.427 --> 01:04:31.386
But you need to leave.
Right now.

1650
01:04:31.387 --> 01:04:33.430
No, Floyd. It's okay.
We're here to rescue you.

1651
01:04:33.431 --> 01:04:34.848
No. This is a trap.

1652
01:04:34.849 --> 01:04:37.100
Velvet and Veneer, they...
they lured you here.

1653
01:04:37.101 --> 01:04:39.269
You gotta leave before
they come back. Hurry!

1654
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:41.563
No. I'm not leaving here
without you.

1655
01:04:41.564 --> 01:04:42.898
Branch, please.

1656
01:04:42.899 --> 01:04:44.358
- Do it for me.
- [Velvet] We're so close.

1657
01:04:44.359 --> 01:04:46.151
I told you BroZone
would show up.

1658
01:04:46.152 --> 01:04:48.153
My letter worked.
I'm a genius.

1659
01:04:48.154 --> 01:04:50.198
[Veneer] Are you sure
you're sure about this?

1660
01:04:54.619 --> 01:04:55.453
[grunts]

1661
01:05:00.291 --> 01:05:01.416
Oh, no.

1662
01:05:01.417 --> 01:05:03.126
- [Rhonda grunts]
- [Veneer] Oh! Ow!

1663
01:05:03.127 --> 01:05:04.962
It's biting me.
Put it in the closet.

1664
01:05:04.963 --> 01:05:06.422
Put it in the closet!

1665
01:05:06.923 --> 01:05:08.007
[Crimp] Hello.

1666
01:05:09.217 --> 01:05:11.176
- Floyd!
- Brothers.

1667
01:05:11.177 --> 01:05:13.387
It's so good to see you. We
would have been here sooner,

1668
01:05:13.388 --> 01:05:15.389
but these guys wouldn't stop
yelling at each other.

1669
01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:16.515
Guys, please.

1670
01:05:16.516 --> 01:05:18.058
John Dory,
you're the one who parked

1671
01:05:18.059 --> 01:05:19.977
in the spot marked
"Reserved for BroZone."

1672
01:05:19.978 --> 01:05:21.812
Didn't that seem
a little sus to you?

1673
01:05:21.813 --> 01:05:24.106
- Oh, so it's my fault?
- Oh, look.

1674
01:05:24.107 --> 01:05:25.983
They're even cute
when they fight.

1675
01:05:25.984 --> 01:05:27.526
- Boop, boop, boop.
- [John Dory] Hey. Stop.

1676
01:05:27.527 --> 01:05:28.610
What are you doing?

1677
01:05:28.611 --> 01:05:30.112
Come on, man.
You're better than this.

1678
01:05:30.113 --> 01:05:31.113
Well, thank you.

1679
01:05:31.114 --> 01:05:32.739
I really don't see why
you're so upset.

1680
01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:34.950
At least we're putting
your talent to good use.

1681
01:05:34.951 --> 01:05:36.827
I mean, you're welcome.

1682
01:05:36.828 --> 01:05:38.078
What? You're sick.

1683
01:05:38.079 --> 01:05:39.496
You mispronounced,

1684
01:05:39.497 --> 01:05:41.874
"Thanks for not letting our
talents go to waste anymore,

1685
01:05:41.875 --> 01:05:43.417
Velvet and Veneer."

1686
01:05:43.418 --> 01:05:46.879
Come on. They're waiting
for us on the red carpet.

1687
01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.755
Let's go autograph some butts.

1688
01:05:48.756 --> 01:05:51.217
Oh, that's fun.
I'll grab my butt marker.

1689
01:06:00.059 --> 01:06:01.059
[Crimp grunts]

1690
01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:02.394
[Rhonda purrs]

1691
01:06:02.395 --> 01:06:04.731
Oh, it looks like
you need a hug.

1692
01:06:05.732 --> 01:06:07.483
[sobbing]

1693
01:06:10.111 --> 01:06:12.237
Okay, now,
whose sibling is this now?

1694
01:06:12.238 --> 01:06:13.405
[sucking]

1695
01:06:13.406 --> 01:06:15.532
[all chanting]
Bergens! Bergens!

1696
01:06:15.533 --> 01:06:18.995
Bergens! Bergens! Bergens!

1697
01:06:19.621 --> 01:06:20.621
Bridgey,

1698
01:06:20.622 --> 01:06:23.082
loving you is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1699
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:26.586
Um, would it be weird
if we made out?

1700
01:06:27.253 --> 01:06:29.796
Babe, it would be weird
if we didn't.

1701
01:06:29.797 --> 01:06:31.466
[kissing]

1702
01:06:39.432 --> 01:06:41.558
[both scream]

1703
01:06:41.559 --> 01:06:42.727
[troll] Wait!

1704
01:06:44.395 --> 01:06:45.730
[both gasp]

1705
01:06:53.738 --> 01:06:54.864
Is this you?

1706
01:06:55.698 --> 01:06:58.242
Hey.
That's me and my best friend.

1707
01:06:58.243 --> 01:07:01.663
[sighs] Yeah. Poppy. She...

1708
01:07:02.539 --> 01:07:03.581
She's my sister.

1709
01:07:04.249 --> 01:07:05.958
You're Poppy's sister? [gasps]

1710
01:07:05.959 --> 01:07:08.126
That makes us best friends too.

1711
01:07:08.127 --> 01:07:10.380
Yeah. She told me about
your wedding. [chuckles]

1712
01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.091
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, girl.

1713
01:07:13.758 --> 01:07:14.758
