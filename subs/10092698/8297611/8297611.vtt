1
00:00:41.576 --> 00:00:44.311
I know what you're thinking.

2
00:00:48.716 --> 00:00:52.720
How did our family become the
true crime story of the decade?

3
00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:58.626
Most people in town labeled it
a psychotic episode.

4
00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.535
But then again,
Salem has a long history

5
00:01:07.635 --> 00:01:10.605
of spreading rumors
that aren't true.

6
00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:38.666
My name's Billie.

7
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:41.603
Me and my brothers were born
in this house.

8
00:01:43.538 --> 00:01:46.306
It's the same house
our dad grew up in.

9
00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:48.643
And his dad before him.

10
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.513
But he's gone now, our dad.

11
00:01:52.614 --> 00:01:54.716
That asshole left
when he sobered up

12
00:01:54.816 --> 00:01:57.518
and realized he had three kids.

13
00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.689
If you ever see John Fletcher,
tell him to rot in hell.

14
00:02:03.858 --> 00:02:06.561
That's Mom. She stayed.

15
00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:10.197
That's her brother, Bob.

16
00:02:11.365 --> 00:02:13.601
He hasn't worked in a while.

17
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.105
Those are my brothers.

18
00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:18.706
That's Marcus.

19
00:02:18.806 --> 00:02:21.042
The little one is Jonah.

20
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:23.210
We call him Jo.

21
00:02:25.546 --> 00:02:29.216
Every kid here in Salem knows
the stories of those women--

22
00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:30.985
the ones who were hung,

23
00:02:31.085 --> 00:02:33.186
burned and drowned
hundreds of years ago.

24
00:02:34.822 --> 00:02:37.825
This is our family story.

25
00:02:38.926 --> 00:02:43.031
The only true crime being
Salem's fucked-up past

26
00:02:43.131 --> 00:02:45.633
and how those
who were cursed before us

27
00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:48.002
brought us the same.

28
00:02:48.102 --> 00:02:52.974
Even here in Salem, they didn't
teach us all our history.

29
00:02:53.074 --> 00:02:55.643
Some stories got lost
along the way.

30
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.943
I will play. I won't quit.

31
00:04:02.043 --> 00:04:04.011
I will play.

32
00:04:04.112 --> 00:04:06.413
I won't quit.

33
00:04:07.882 --> 00:04:10.585
I will play. I will play.

34
00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:12.352
I won't quit.

35
00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:15.223
I will play. I will play.

36
00:04:15.322 --> 00:04:16.891
I won't quit.

37
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:19.927
I will play. I will play.

38
00:04:21.896 --> 00:04:23.765
Maybe if they had taught us

39
00:04:23.865 --> 00:04:25.298
everything that happened,

40
00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:27.802
my brother would've left
that knife where he found it.

41
00:04:32.507 --> 00:04:34.742
Jonah.

42
00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:42.315
Come find me, Jo.

43
00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:10.711
Over here, Jo.

44
00:05:44.712 --> 00:05:47.081
Is this a human bone?

45
00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:48.415
Looks like it.

46
00:05:48.516 --> 00:05:50.017
Okay, that's disgusting.

47
00:05:50.117 --> 00:05:51.285
What is that?

48
00:05:51.418 --> 00:05:53.386
-A diary.
-Whose diary?

49
00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:55.556
Somebody really goddamn old.

50
00:05:55.656 --> 00:05:59.160
"He who proclaims it
shall provide the vessel.

51
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.596
The vessel be damned, cometh
the strike of the witch."

52
00:06:01.696 --> 00:06:03.731
- Creepy, right?
- You realize you broke into

53
00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:05.498
someone's house here.
That's a crime.

54
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.467
-This is nobody's house.
-I don't think that's true.

55
00:06:07.568 --> 00:06:09.670
Whoever lived here is probably
a psycho or a satanist.

56
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.371
And they probably made
that knife

57
00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:13.241
from one of their victim's
bones, so put it back.

58
00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:14.242
Let's go.

59
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.083
Uh, yeah, no, I-I actually

60
00:06:22.183 --> 00:06:24.585
had a dream about us
the other night.

61
00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:28.289
No, it wasn't
that kind of dream.

62
00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.423
Okay, maybe, like, a little.

63
00:06:30.524 --> 00:06:32.560
-Ew.
-Yes.

64
00:06:33.361 --> 00:06:35.663
Yes, I want you to beg.
Yes, I...

65
00:06:35.763 --> 00:06:37.665
- Sophie.
- That was disgusting.

66
00:06:37.765 --> 00:06:39.533
-Rude. What?
-That was foul.

67
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.936
- I don't want to listen to you
have phone sex.

68
00:06:42.003 --> 00:06:44.171
Okay, fine. Whatever.

69
00:06:44.272 --> 00:06:45.640
But guess who's going
to Pilar's party

70
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.175
- at the Gallows tonight.
- Not me.

71
00:06:48.276 --> 00:06:50.111
I have an interview
at 9:00 a.m.

72
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:51.345
Oh, right, right.

73
00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:53.214
For... was it Subway?

74
00:06:53.314 --> 00:06:56.050
-Fuck you. Fuck you.
-Gonna be a Sandwich
Artist or...?

75
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:57.318
-Smith alum.
-Yes, I know.

76
00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:59.053
You want to go to school
in the boonies

77
00:06:59.153 --> 00:07:01.522
-with all the lesbians.
-First of all, ignorant.

78
00:07:01.622 --> 00:07:02.857
Straight people go
to Smith, too.

79
00:07:02.957 --> 00:07:04.558
Second of all,
as a lesbian myself,

80
00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:06.093
that sounds pretty great.

81
00:07:06.193 --> 00:07:08.296
Okay, come on, Sophe.

82
00:07:08.396 --> 00:07:10.131
We never do anything.

83
00:07:11.098 --> 00:07:12.333
We never go to parties.

84
00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:14.502
Yeah, because it's cold
and they suck.

85
00:07:14.602 --> 00:07:16.270
And if I wanted to have
vacuous conversations,

86
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.905
-I would hang out
with my parents.
-Okay.

87
00:07:18.005 --> 00:07:20.374
-Wow. "Vacuous." I guess you do
belong at Smith.
-Cute.

88
00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:21.575
I also really
don't want to watch

89
00:07:21.676 --> 00:07:22.810
you and Pete eat
each other's face.

90
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.212
Just look,
you're my best friend.

91
00:07:25.313 --> 00:07:26.881
Please.

92
00:07:26.981 --> 00:07:28.416
Please, it won't be fun
without you.

93
00:07:28.516 --> 00:07:30.184
Come with me.

94
00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:32.320
Oh, wow. You're manipulative.

95
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.388
Best friend.

96
00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:36.057
Wilhelmina?

97
00:07:36.157 --> 00:07:37.858
Wilhelmina?

98
00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:40.528
Mom.
- Fine. Billie.

99
00:07:40.628 --> 00:07:42.630
I like "Wilhelmina."
I think it's pretty.

100
00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.632
Me... me, too, Sophie.

101
00:07:44.732 --> 00:07:46.734
-Have you seen your brothers?
-No.

102
00:07:46.834 --> 00:07:49.971
I mean, thankfully,
not since breakfast.

103
00:08:03.918 --> 00:08:06.020
These drinks always make me
need to shit.

104
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.888
What?

105
00:08:09.657 --> 00:08:11.425
Look at these fucking goofs.

106
00:08:11.525 --> 00:08:12.793
Hey, Fletcher,
I hear your sister's

107
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.562
- getting stuffed by Pete.
- Ooh, Pete.

108
00:08:14.628 --> 00:08:16.597
Stuff me.

109
00:08:18.232 --> 00:08:19.900
- Jo!
- The fuck?

110
00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:21.702
-Don't talk about my sister
like that, dicks!
-Jo!

111
00:08:21.802 --> 00:08:23.537
-You fucking brain-dead?
-I'm not scared of those guys.

112
00:08:23.637 --> 00:08:24.905
I just got this thing detailed.

113
00:08:25.006 --> 00:08:26.107
You're gonna fucking pay
for that, Fletcher.

114
00:08:26.207 --> 00:08:27.541
Sure. Yeah.

115
00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:28.776
I'll get that check
right over to your dad.

116
00:08:28.943 --> 00:08:30.478
Fuck are you laughing at?

117
00:08:30.544 --> 00:08:32.313
Hey, you can suck my balls.
Hey!

118
00:08:32.413 --> 00:08:34.348
Don't fucking touch him.

119
00:08:34.448 --> 00:08:35.816
- Yeah.
- You know what?

120
00:08:35.916 --> 00:08:37.685
I think the reason
you two are so fucked-up

121
00:08:37.785 --> 00:08:38.986
is 'cause you don't have

122
00:08:39.086 --> 00:08:40.855
a strong male role model
in your life.

123
00:08:40.955 --> 00:08:43.224
Maybe I should come by your
house and give your mom a hand.

124
00:08:43.324 --> 00:08:45.326
That was awesome.

125
00:08:45.426 --> 00:08:47.161
-You kicked their asses.
-Okay, Jo.

126
00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:48.829
You know what? Next time,
we'll do some karate shit

127
00:08:48.929 --> 00:08:50.297
and fold them like pancakes.

128
00:08:50.398 --> 00:08:51.999
-"Oh, my nose!"
-Fucking stop!

129
00:08:52.099 --> 00:08:53.701
What's your problem?

130
00:08:53.801 --> 00:08:55.936
What's my problem?
What's my fucking problem?

131
00:08:56.037 --> 00:08:57.038
You are, Jo.

132
00:08:57.138 --> 00:08:58.839
Why did you throw
the fucking drink?

133
00:08:58.939 --> 00:09:01.308
You're always doing shit
like this.

134
00:09:01.409 --> 00:09:02.743
Like what?

135
00:09:02.843 --> 00:09:06.647
Uh, breaking into houses,
starting fights.

136
00:09:06.747 --> 00:09:09.050
I should've let them
kick your ass.

137
00:09:14.622 --> 00:09:16.857
Jonah.

138
00:09:20.861 --> 00:09:22.630
Jonah.

139
00:09:38.112 --> 00:09:40.081
Hey, little man.

140
00:09:40.181 --> 00:09:41.382
What's in the bag?

141
00:09:41.482 --> 00:09:44.085
Uh, uh, Roman candles, M-80s.

142
00:09:46.387 --> 00:09:47.688
Cool.

143
00:09:47.788 --> 00:09:49.657
Speaking of "vacuous,"

144
00:09:49.757 --> 00:09:52.059
I got to go have dinner
with my parents. Bye, Mom.

145
00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:53.627
- Yep. -See you later.
- See ya.

146
00:09:53.727 --> 00:09:55.129
Where do you think
you're going tonight?

147
00:09:55.229 --> 00:09:56.597
Party at the Gallows.

148
00:09:56.697 --> 00:09:57.932
Yeah, no.

149
00:09:58.032 --> 00:09:59.568
-Mom.
-No, I picked up another shift.

150
00:09:59.667 --> 00:10:01.268
-I need you here
with your brother.
-Mom.

151
00:10:01.368 --> 00:10:03.604
Wait, what's Marcus doing?

152
00:10:03.704 --> 00:10:05.973
I don't think Jo needs
both of us to watch him.

153
00:10:06.073 --> 00:10:07.741
He had plans.
I made him cancel.

154
00:10:07.842 --> 00:10:09.343
I'm making you cancel, too.

155
00:10:09.443 --> 00:10:10.811
What plans? What plans?

156
00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:12.581
He gets high in
Randy's basement and pretends

157
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.181
to be in a band
that nobody's ever heard of.

158
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:16.183
I don't want to argue with you
every time I ask you

159
00:10:16.283 --> 00:10:17.618
to do something, okay, Billie?
I'm tired.

160
00:10:17.718 --> 00:10:19.019
It'll be like two hours.
Please.

161
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.754
This is so unfair.

162
00:10:20.855 --> 00:10:22.557
You know what's unfair?

163
00:10:22.656 --> 00:10:24.191
-Okay, I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

164
00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:25.594
I need you, kiddo, okay?

165
00:10:25.693 --> 00:10:28.896
You're the only one
I can depend on.

166
00:10:29.697 --> 00:10:30.898
Jesus Christ.

167
00:10:30.998 --> 00:10:32.800
-Marcus, what happened?
-I tripped.

168
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.503
-Jo?
-He kicked
Nick Libertini's ass.

169
00:10:34.603 --> 00:10:37.238
-This is why I can't leave
these two alone.
-It was cool.

170
00:10:37.338 --> 00:10:39.740
Marcus has to grow up, okay?
You can't keep coddling...

171
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.275
Are you busting Mom's balls
'cause you want

172
00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:43.344
to go fuck your boyfriend
in the woods tonight?

173
00:10:43.444 --> 00:10:44.645
Wha...

174
00:10:44.745 --> 00:10:46.113
- You're an asshole.
- Marcus.

175
00:10:46.213 --> 00:10:47.681
-Hey, at least I'm
fucking somebody.
-Fuck you.

176
00:10:47.781 --> 00:10:49.049
You know what?
Okay, both of you,

177
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.585
your phones right now--
give them to me.

178
00:10:50.684 --> 00:10:52.319
-What? No.
-Seriously?

179
00:10:52.554 --> 00:10:54.221
-I warned you about language
in front of your brother.
-Mom.

180
00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:55.656
Okay, how are we supposed
to watch Jo without our phones?

181
00:10:55.723 --> 00:10:57.224
I don't know. Be present?

182
00:10:57.324 --> 00:11:00.094
And if there's an emergency,
use the landline.

183
00:11:00.194 --> 00:11:01.563
Come on.

184
00:11:01.662 --> 00:11:03.164
Now.

185
00:11:05.032 --> 00:11:08.002
Just so you know, I'm moving to
New York this summer with Pete.

186
00:11:08.102 --> 00:11:09.904
You've got to be the dumbest
smart person I know.

187
00:11:10.004 --> 00:11:11.640
Yeah? And why is that?
Because I actually want to get

188
00:11:11.805 --> 00:11:13.575
out of here and I'm actually
doing something about it?

189
00:11:13.642 --> 00:11:15.510
No, because all you do is

190
00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.144
follow that guy around
like a puppy.

191
00:11:17.244 --> 00:11:19.747
-You're moving?
-No, she is not moving, okay?

192
00:11:19.847 --> 00:11:21.215
Please don't upset
your brother.

193
00:11:21.315 --> 00:11:22.383
He doesn't care about me.

194
00:11:22.483 --> 00:11:23.851
-Can I have your room?
-See?

195
00:11:23.951 --> 00:11:25.152
So, you're dropping out
of high school

196
00:11:25.252 --> 00:11:27.755
to move in
with some spoiled fuckboy

197
00:11:27.855 --> 00:11:30.224
who is gonna drop you
the first chance he gets?

198
00:11:30.324 --> 00:11:32.126
And yeah, where is
your future going, dumbass?

199
00:11:32.226 --> 00:11:34.596
What, are you gonna pump gas
with those ACT scores?

200
00:11:34.695 --> 00:11:37.198
Or-or maybe the next time

201
00:11:37.298 --> 00:11:38.999
that you beat the shit
out of somebody,

202
00:11:39.099 --> 00:11:41.503
they press charges
and you go to jail.

203
00:11:41.603 --> 00:11:43.103
Or worse, an asylum.

204
00:11:43.204 --> 00:11:44.471
-Yeah.
-Psycho.

205
00:11:44.573 --> 00:11:46.407
Okay, Billie, that is enough.

206
00:11:46.508 --> 00:11:48.610
Mom, please don't
do this to me.

207
00:11:48.709 --> 00:11:50.144
You'll be okay.

208
00:11:50.244 --> 00:11:53.180
I'm late. Please take Marcus
some ice for his lip,

209
00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.883
and make sure Uncle Bob
doesn't smoke in the house.

210
00:11:55.983 --> 00:11:57.818
Is there anything else
you want to add to the list?

211
00:11:57.918 --> 00:12:00.120
Uh, yes.

212
00:12:00.221 --> 00:12:02.356
Make Jo a sandwich.

213
00:12:03.357 --> 00:12:04.391
Love you.

214
00:12:09.029 --> 00:12:10.632
Can I have a Dorito sandwich?

215
00:12:16.504 --> 00:12:19.106
Come find me, Jo.

216
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.353
Jo...

217
00:12:33.722 --> 00:12:35.322
Hey.

218
00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:37.525
-Huh?
-You all right?

219
00:12:37.626 --> 00:12:39.460
Yeah.

220
00:12:39.561 --> 00:12:41.663
Did-did you...

221
00:12:41.762 --> 00:12:43.230
Did I...

222
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.299
Oh, nothing, nothing.

223
00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:47.835
Okay.

224
00:13:01.683 --> 00:13:03.450
Mm.

225
00:13:05.819 --> 00:13:07.955
Why do you hate him so much?

226
00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:10.625
Didn't he give you his kidney?

227
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.862
Um... yeah, we were babies, Jo.

228
00:13:14.962 --> 00:13:17.031
He didn't give it to me.

229
00:13:17.131 --> 00:13:20.401
And that's not an excuse to be
a lifelong dick, you know?

230
00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:43.591
Jo.

231
00:13:44.626 --> 00:13:46.393
-Is Mom gone?
-Yeah.

232
00:15:01.603 --> 00:15:05.372
"I will..."

233
00:15:11.011 --> 00:15:13.548
"I won't..."

234
00:15:14.816 --> 00:15:17.251
"I won't...

235
00:15:18.686 --> 00:15:22.289
...qu... quit."

236
00:15:25.593 --> 00:15:27.261
"I will play.

237
00:15:27.361 --> 00:15:28.630
I won't quit."

238
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.598
You will play!

239
00:15:30.698 --> 00:15:32.032
You won't quit!

240
00:15:34.736 --> 00:15:36.203
You will play! You won't quit!

241
00:15:36.303 --> 00:15:38.272
You will play!
You won't quit!

242
00:15:38.372 --> 00:15:40.174
You will play! You won't quit!

243
00:15:40.274 --> 00:15:42.109
You will play!
You won't quit!

244
00:15:42.209 --> 00:15:45.045
You will play! You won't quit!

245
00:15:45.145 --> 00:15:47.649
Shut up! Shut up!

246
00:16:12.072 --> 00:16:13.741
Jo.

247
00:16:51.646 --> 00:16:54.081
"Tell me..."

248
00:17:02.757 --> 00:17:04.592
"...demon..."

249
00:17:12.165 --> 00:17:14.401
You want to watch a movie?

250
00:17:14.502 --> 00:17:16.638
Mm.

251
00:17:17.639 --> 00:17:20.474
-You okay?
-Mm.

252
00:17:20.575 --> 00:17:22.309
You don't look okay.

253
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.612
I'm fine.

254
00:17:32.687 --> 00:17:34.756
Sorry I lost it earlier.

255
00:17:36.724 --> 00:17:38.358
It's okay.

256
00:17:38.458 --> 00:17:41.529
You're still a creep, though.

257
00:17:52.707 --> 00:17:56.109
Okay, Sophie, this is insane.
What is happ...

258
00:17:59.681 --> 00:18:01.214
Jonah.

259
00:18:05.452 --> 00:18:07.187
So now she's pissed.

260
00:18:07.287 --> 00:18:09.489
Which, I mean, rightfully so,
in my opinion.

261
00:18:09.591 --> 00:18:12.459
Come find me, Jo.

262
00:18:13.761 --> 00:18:15.797
Hey. Jo.

263
00:18:16.798 --> 00:18:18.265
Jo.

264
00:18:19.033 --> 00:18:20.434
Jo?

265
00:18:22.537 --> 00:18:23.470
Jo.

266
00:18:23.571 --> 00:18:25.138
Hey. Jo.

267
00:18:29.043 --> 00:18:31.079
Hey, do you want me to, uh,

268
00:18:31.178 --> 00:18:33.648
make you, like,
a frozen pizza or something?

269
00:18:34.649 --> 00:18:35.750
No.

270
00:18:37.518 --> 00:18:39.252
Okay.

271
00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:46.527
The fuck?

272
00:18:46.628 --> 00:18:48.228
-I don't like that.
-Uh, what...

273
00:18:48.328 --> 00:18:49.931
Should we call the cops?

274
00:18:50.031 --> 00:18:51.164
Yeah, let's call the cops,
tell 'em

275
00:18:51.264 --> 00:18:52.634
someone's knocking on our door.

276
00:18:54.201 --> 00:18:56.871
It's probably those assholes
from the cemetery.

277
00:19:06.848 --> 00:19:08.583
Who is it?

278
00:19:10.718 --> 00:19:12.053
-It's nothing.
-Ha!

279
00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:13.955
Whoa, dude, it's Pete.
You trying to kill me?

280
00:19:14.055 --> 00:19:16.289
Oh, my God,
you're such a little shit.

281
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.559
Your brother thought
it was pretty funny.

282
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.293
Ha-ha.

283
00:19:37.779 --> 00:19:39.446
You're gonna get a film camera?

284
00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.281
You're gonna move to New York
and get a film camera?

285
00:19:41.381 --> 00:19:43.017
-Yeah, how are you gonna
pay for that?
-Oh, Sophie.

286
00:19:43.151 --> 00:19:45.586
-Yeah, no...
-What, are you
gonna... gonna make a darkroom

287
00:19:45.687 --> 00:19:47.421
in a and cave that you're gonna
have to live in?

288
00:19:47.522 --> 00:19:49.090
-Oh, ha-ha. Very funny, Sophie.
-Wow.

289
00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:51.258
You know what I think
we should do right now?

290
00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:53.226
-Hmm?
-Get out of here,
go to the party.

291
00:19:53.326 --> 00:19:54.862
-Come on, let's go, babe.
-I can't. I can't.

292
00:19:54.962 --> 00:19:56.329
I told you I have to watch Jo.

293
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:57.765
What time does
your mom get home?

294
00:19:57.865 --> 00:20:00.367
Like 2:00 a.m.
- 2:00 a.m.

295
00:20:00.467 --> 00:20:02.402
I'll have you back
way before then.

296
00:20:02.503 --> 00:20:04.839
She's supposed to be
watching me.

297
00:20:04.939 --> 00:20:06.273
- Um...
- You tell him.

298
00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.842
You don't need anybody
watching you, little man.

299
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:09.309
You're like 13.

300
00:20:09.476 --> 00:20:11.211
I mean, it's cool.
We can just, like, chill.

301
00:20:11.278 --> 00:20:13.380
Here, have a drink.
Listen to some music.

302
00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.149
Just one drink, Sophie.

303
00:20:15.248 --> 00:20:16.884
-Are you peer-pressuring me?
-No.

304
00:20:16.984 --> 00:20:18.820
It's working.

305
00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.823
Hey, you kids
got I.D. in there?

306
00:20:21.923 --> 00:20:23.558
Ah...

307
00:20:23.658 --> 00:20:25.893
- What up, Bobby?
- Hey, Pedro.

308
00:20:25.993 --> 00:20:27.427
- Hi.
- Oh, don't worry.

309
00:20:27.528 --> 00:20:28.830
I'm not looking.
Don't worry. Don't worry.

310
00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.497
Just kidding. Give me
a fucking beer. Come on.

311
00:20:30.598 --> 00:20:32.033
- Ah...
- Hey! Oh!

312
00:20:32.133 --> 00:20:33.768
- Thank you.
- Uh, hey, Bob.

313
00:20:33.868 --> 00:20:36.003
Remember Mom doesn't like you
smoking in the house?

314
00:20:36.104 --> 00:20:38.305
Mm. Open a window.

315
00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:39.540
Dude, come on.

316
00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.308
-Jo's right there.
-Fine.

317
00:20:41.408 --> 00:20:42.577
But maybe Marco
might want a little...

318
00:20:42.677 --> 00:20:44.779
- No. No, put it out.
- Why?

319
00:20:44.879 --> 00:20:45.980
No, seriously, come on.

320
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.414
-Stop showing off.
-Okay, Mom.

321
00:20:47.582 --> 00:20:50.051
- Okay, immature. Come on.
- Hey.

322
00:20:50.118 --> 00:20:52.319
- Thank you.
- Hit that.

323
00:20:53.788 --> 00:20:55.388
- Yo, Bobby.
- Hmm?

324
00:20:55.489 --> 00:20:56.824
You want to go
to the party with us tonight?

325
00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.327
It's not a good look, buddy.

326
00:21:00.427 --> 00:21:02.096
-You can pull it off.
-Oh, thank you.

327
00:21:02.196 --> 00:21:03.765
Marcus, what do you say?
You down?

328
00:21:03.865 --> 00:21:05.199
-What?
-Okay, no.

329
00:21:05.298 --> 00:21:06.768
He's... he's not invited.

330
00:21:06.868 --> 00:21:08.435
- I just got invited.
- You're invited.

331
00:21:08.536 --> 00:21:10.437
I'm invited. There we go.

332
00:21:10.538 --> 00:21:12.472
-No. Get your own plans.
-Come on, babe.

333
00:21:12.573 --> 00:21:14.142
Don't be mean.
I want to come to a party.

334
00:21:14.242 --> 00:21:15.408
What are your friends doing?
Oh, I forgot.

335
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:16.644
-You don't have any.
-Oh, fuck you.

336
00:21:16.744 --> 00:21:17.912
-My friends are busy.
-Oh, ouch.

337
00:21:18.012 --> 00:21:19.379
Yeah, I want to go to a party.

338
00:21:19.479 --> 00:21:20.615
Why should I stay here
when you get to go out?

339
00:21:20.715 --> 00:21:22.183
Uh, because somebody
has to watch Jo.

340
00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:23.551
-Bob.
-Huh? What?

341
00:21:23.618 --> 00:21:24.952
- What? What?
- You can watch Jo, right?

342
00:21:25.019 --> 00:21:26.721
- Are you kidding?
- Are you crazy?

343
00:21:26.821 --> 00:21:27.889
Bob... He's an adult.

344
00:21:27.989 --> 00:21:29.190
I am technically an adult.

345
00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:30.490
-Hardly. No.
-I am an adult.

346
00:21:30.591 --> 00:21:31.926
Come on. Don't be mean.

347
00:21:32.026 --> 00:21:33.728
Jo, you don't mind, right?

348
00:21:37.899 --> 00:21:39.332
Okay, fine. Fine.

349
00:21:39.432 --> 00:21:41.235
Bob, you're watching Jo.

350
00:21:43.204 --> 00:21:46.339
Don't let them leave.

351
00:21:47.141 --> 00:21:48.341
Hey!

352
00:21:48.441 --> 00:21:50.211
Make them play.

353
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.346
Make them play.

354
00:21:53.446 --> 00:21:55.382
No one's going anywhere.

355
00:21:57.185 --> 00:21:59.954
You guys leave, I call Mom.

356
00:22:00.054 --> 00:22:01.289
Whoa. Not cool, dude.

357
00:22:01.388 --> 00:22:02.557
Jo, we'll have a good time,
all right?

358
00:22:02.723 --> 00:22:05.392
Mom doesn't want Bob
looking after me.

359
00:22:05.458 --> 00:22:06.928
She thinks he's a fuckup.

360
00:22:07.028 --> 00:22:09.263
- Whoa. Okay, Jo.
- What did you call me?

361
00:22:09.362 --> 00:22:10.665
- Dude. -Hey.
- Jo, language.

362
00:22:10.765 --> 00:22:12.499
-Come on, don't be like that.
-Like what?

363
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.369
Someone you can move
to New York to get away from?

364
00:22:16.469 --> 00:22:19.307
Or someone Marcus can blame
for all of his problems?

365
00:22:19.406 --> 00:22:20.942
Hey, that's not fair.

366
00:22:21.042 --> 00:22:22.342
What's not fair?

367
00:22:22.442 --> 00:22:23.578
That I'm your only friend

368
00:22:23.678 --> 00:22:25.179
and you still treat me
like shit?

369
00:22:25.279 --> 00:22:26.881
What the fuck? What's up?

370
00:22:26.981 --> 00:22:28.816
You all want to leave me,
and I won't let you.

371
00:22:28.916 --> 00:22:30.383
-Uh... Jo.
-We're...

372
00:22:30.483 --> 00:22:31.853
-We're just going to a party.
-Yeah. We're not...

373
00:22:31.953 --> 00:22:33.821
-We'll be back.
-Yeah, we're not leaving you.

374
00:22:33.921 --> 00:22:35.455
-Yeah.
-Uh, you can just
hang here with Bob.

375
00:22:35.556 --> 00:22:37.258
Play some games.
Play "Fortnite."

376
00:22:37.357 --> 00:22:39.760
I don't want to play
"Fortnite."

377
00:22:40.895 --> 00:22:43.998
I want to play
a different game.

378
00:22:44.098 --> 00:22:47.301
If you play with me, then
I'll let you go to your party

379
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.770
and I won't call Mom.

380
00:22:49.871 --> 00:22:51.105
Okay, Jo.

381
00:22:51.205 --> 00:22:53.841
What game do you want to play,
hmm?

382
00:23:04.484 --> 00:23:07.855
Come on, babe. I'm not playing
duck, duck, goose.

383
00:23:07.955 --> 00:23:09.924
Just humor him.

384
00:23:10.024 --> 00:23:11.926
I just want to go on record
that I'm not

385
00:23:12.026 --> 00:23:15.062
really good at games,
but I'll try my best, Jo.

386
00:23:16.063 --> 00:23:17.031
You, too, Bob.

387
00:23:17.131 --> 00:23:18.566
Uh, I'll be the judge.

388
00:23:18.666 --> 00:23:21.035
You'll tell Mom
about the money.

389
00:23:21.135 --> 00:23:23.170
I'll tell Mom about the money.

390
00:23:24.471 --> 00:23:26.140
What money?

391
00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.176
That you steal from her purse
when she's not looking.

392
00:23:30.511 --> 00:23:32.412
You're a little asshole
sometimes, you know that?

393
00:23:32.513 --> 00:23:33.446
He's a kid.

394
00:23:33.547 --> 00:23:34.582
Jo. Come on.

395
00:23:34.682 --> 00:23:35.950
How do we play this game?

396
00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:38.352
One by one,

397
00:23:38.451 --> 00:23:43.190
you'll all say,
"I will play. I won't quit."

398
00:23:47.595 --> 00:23:48.896
Sophie.

399
00:23:48.996 --> 00:23:50.463
Sophie, say the words.

400
00:23:51.265 --> 00:23:54.168
I will play. I won't quit.

401
00:23:54.268 --> 00:23:56.137
I will play.
I won't quit.

402
00:23:56.237 --> 00:23:57.738
I will play.

403
00:23:59.507 --> 00:24:01.042
I will play.

404
00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:04.211
Pete.

405
00:24:05.246 --> 00:24:07.315
I will play. I won't quit.

406
00:24:10.584 --> 00:24:13.120
- What?
- Jo?

407
00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:16.223
Jonah, I swear, if you're
playing a trick on us,

408
00:24:16.324 --> 00:24:18.292
it's not funny.

409
00:24:18.392 --> 00:24:20.161
-Is that a knife?
-Okay.

410
00:24:20.261 --> 00:24:21.696
- Jesus Christ, Jo.
- Okay, no.

411
00:24:21.796 --> 00:24:24.198
I told you... Give it to me.

412
00:24:27.902 --> 00:24:30.004
Billie,
they're tapping the keg.

413
00:24:30.104 --> 00:24:31.305
We're not done yet.

414
00:24:31.405 --> 00:24:32.907
Game's over, Jo, okay?

415
00:24:33.007 --> 00:24:34.474
We're leaving now.

416
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:37.778
Jesus Christ.

417
00:24:37.878 --> 00:24:39.313
Are you coming?

418
00:24:41.182 --> 00:24:43.250
Hey. Marcus.

419
00:24:44.418 --> 00:24:45.953
Marcus.

420
00:24:46.053 --> 00:24:47.487
Are you coming?

421
00:24:55.229 --> 00:24:57.131
I'll stay with Jo. You guys go.

422
00:24:57.231 --> 00:25:00.501
I... I mean, Bob's here.

423
00:25:01.302 --> 00:25:02.803
No, it's fine.

424
00:25:02.903 --> 00:25:04.238
I got him.

425
00:25:04.338 --> 00:25:06.207
Okay. Cool.

426
00:25:07.541 --> 00:25:08.909
Be good, Jo.

427
00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:10.711
Okay?

428
00:25:19.487 --> 00:25:20.921
Jesus, Jo. What is up with you?

429
00:25:21.022 --> 00:25:22.390
- Make him say the words.
- Say the words.

430
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:23.758
-What do you mean?
-Say the words.

431
00:25:23.858 --> 00:25:25.259
-Stop! Say what?
-Say it!

432
00:25:25.359 --> 00:25:27.294
-On the knife!
-Stop. Stop. Okay.

433
00:25:27.395 --> 00:25:29.764
-What? "I-I will play.
I won't quit." There.
-No.

434
00:25:30.965 --> 00:25:32.501
Make him say the rest of it.

435
00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.734
Say the rest of it.
On the knife.

436
00:25:33.834 --> 00:25:35.102
-Say the rest of it.
-Okay. Stop.

437
00:25:35.202 --> 00:25:36.505
-Say it! Say it!
-Stop. Okay.

438
00:25:36.604 --> 00:25:39.206
"Tell me, demon, am I it?"

439
00:25:46.313 --> 00:25:48.049
Mar-Marcus?

440
00:26:07.502 --> 00:26:09.103
You will play. You won't quit.

441
00:26:10.304 --> 00:26:12.273
You will play. You won't quit!

442
00:26:16.077 --> 00:26:17.178
Marcus.

443
00:26:17.278 --> 00:26:19.013
How did I get in bed?

444
00:26:19.113 --> 00:26:20.448
You passed out.

445
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:22.450
Bob helped you up here.

446
00:26:22.551 --> 00:26:23.851
He wanted to take you
to the hospital,

447
00:26:23.951 --> 00:26:25.520
but I told him he was too high.

448
00:26:25.653 --> 00:26:28.022
I'm just supposed to tell him
when you wake up.

449
00:26:32.193 --> 00:26:34.061
Where's the knife?

450
00:26:34.161 --> 00:26:36.163
I think we should
get rid of the knife.

451
00:26:36.263 --> 00:26:37.398
It made me feel weird.

452
00:26:37.498 --> 00:26:39.400
Yeah, I-I'll...

453
00:26:39.501 --> 00:26:41.368
I'll get rid of it.

454
00:26:41.469 --> 00:26:43.971
But I-I need to see it.

455
00:26:44.071 --> 00:26:45.372
Where is it?

456
00:26:46.607 --> 00:26:48.142
Tell me.

457
00:26:49.578 --> 00:26:51.679
Jo.

458
00:26:52.547 --> 00:26:54.381
Under my bed.

459
00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.018
Okay.

460
00:27:01.222 --> 00:27:02.957
Good.

461
00:27:04.358 --> 00:27:06.393
Go to sleep.

462
00:27:06.494 --> 00:27:07.895
It's late.

463
00:27:09.063 --> 00:27:10.197
Go.

464
00:27:21.742 --> 00:27:23.612
♪ I'm overjoyed,
I'm overjoyed ♪

465
00:27:23.711 --> 00:27:25.679
♪ Just standing there
in corduroy... ♪

466
00:27:25.779 --> 00:27:27.681
Okay, okay.
I got it, I got it, I got it.

467
00:27:27.781 --> 00:27:30.151
Watch this.

468
00:27:31.085 --> 00:27:34.021
-Oh! That was pretty close.
-It was really close.

469
00:27:35.689 --> 00:27:37.925
Pilar, all right.

470
00:27:38.025 --> 00:27:40.661
Okay, if we sweep,
it's a naked lap, girls.

471
00:27:41.896 --> 00:27:44.031
Gallows rules.

472
00:27:44.131 --> 00:27:45.933
I'm having such a good time
tonight.

473
00:27:46.033 --> 00:27:47.935
I'm really psyched
you guys could make it.

474
00:27:48.035 --> 00:27:49.604
I don't have a lot
of girl friends.

475
00:27:49.703 --> 00:27:51.640
-Hmm.,
-Can't imagine why.

476
00:27:51.739 --> 00:27:53.542
- Sophie, be nice.
- Wow.

477
00:27:53.642 --> 00:27:55.676
- What?
- Yeah, I don't bite.

478
00:27:55.776 --> 00:27:58.012
Unless you ask me to.

479
00:27:58.112 --> 00:28:00.881
-Are you flirting with me?
-Do you want me to?

480
00:28:03.585 --> 00:28:05.019
Hey, can we finish the game?

481
00:28:05.119 --> 00:28:06.453
Uh, yeah.

482
00:28:08.122 --> 00:28:09.823
- Oh, yes, yes, yes!
- All right.

483
00:28:09.924 --> 00:28:11.258
-Suck it!
-That was good.

484
00:28:11.358 --> 00:28:12.359
- You're fired up, babe.
- I like it. -Whoo!

485
00:28:12.459 --> 00:28:14.828
But unfortunately...

486
00:28:14.929 --> 00:28:16.830
...you got to drink.

487
00:28:16.931 --> 00:28:19.466
This is so unfair, okay?
Sophie stinks at this game.

488
00:28:19.568 --> 00:28:21.368
Sorry I'm not good
at beer sports.

489
00:28:21.468 --> 00:28:23.270
I'm also a bit of a klutz.

490
00:28:24.038 --> 00:28:25.607
What was the point of that?

491
00:28:25.706 --> 00:28:27.341
I'm sorry.

492
00:29:27.201 --> 00:29:28.936
Marcus?

493
00:29:30.705 --> 00:29:32.206
Marcus.

494
00:29:37.679 --> 00:29:39.780
Marcus! Please open the door.

495
00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.983
I know you have the knife.
Open the door.

496
00:30:23.658 --> 00:30:25.993
Now make them play.

497
00:30:50.484 --> 00:30:52.554
What did you do?

498
00:30:57.991 --> 00:31:00.394
Let's play.

499
00:31:12.339 --> 00:31:14.308
Bob.

500
00:31:14.408 --> 00:31:16.644
Bob, Bob, wake up,
wake up, wake up.

501
00:31:16.745 --> 00:31:18.513
Jo, what-what is it?
What? What?

502
00:31:18.613 --> 00:31:20.114
-M-Marcus... The knife.
-What?

503
00:31:20.214 --> 00:31:21.649
-What? What?
-I don't know what's going on.

504
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:23.250
- What are you talking about?
- Jo.

505
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:25.787
- Something's wrong.
- Calm down.

506
00:31:25.886 --> 00:31:27.555
Who is that? Is that Marcus?

507
00:31:27.655 --> 00:31:29.056
What do you got
in your hand, bud?

508
00:31:29.156 --> 00:31:30.558
-No, we got to leave, Bob.
-Hey, talk to me, Marc...

509
00:31:30.658 --> 00:31:32.359
-Bob, we got to go.
-Hey, hey. Okay, wait, wait.

510
00:31:32.459 --> 00:31:34.294
-No, you don't understand.
-I got... I gotta. I gotta.

511
00:31:34.428 --> 00:31:36.731
Shit, what the hell
is going on?

512
00:31:36.798 --> 00:31:39.466
No, Bob, you-you don't...

513
00:31:39.567 --> 00:31:41.368
Okay, uh...

514
00:31:41.468 --> 00:31:42.704
Hey, buddy. Hey.

515
00:31:42.804 --> 00:31:44.438
What are you doing, man?

516
00:31:45.205 --> 00:31:48.041
You're just... you're just
messing with us, right?

517
00:31:50.477 --> 00:31:52.647
Let's play a game, Bob.

518
00:31:52.747 --> 00:31:54.982
Jesus, Marcus, your forehead.

519
00:31:55.082 --> 00:31:58.520
How about some... hangman?

520
00:31:58.620 --> 00:31:59.788
Marcus, you're bleeding.

521
00:31:59.888 --> 00:32:02.189
Am I?

522
00:32:03.892 --> 00:32:04.958
- Shit!
- Marcus, stop!

523
00:32:05.058 --> 00:32:06.861
Marcus, no! Stop!

524
00:32:09.664 --> 00:32:10.665
Marcus, stop.

525
00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.135
Let me go, man. Let me...

526
00:32:15.235 --> 00:32:17.404
Marcus, please let me go.

527
00:32:17.505 --> 00:32:18.640
Let me go.

528
00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.073
What word am I thinking of,
Bob?

529
00:32:20.174 --> 00:32:22.544
-Four letters.
-Marcus, help.

530
00:32:22.644 --> 00:32:24.344
-Help, Marcus.
-That's not it.

531
00:32:25.446 --> 00:32:28.015
Marcus! Stop it!

532
00:32:28.115 --> 00:32:29.884
This is Uncle Bob!

533
00:32:29.983 --> 00:32:31.452
Put him down!

534
00:32:32.219 --> 00:32:35.255
Guess a letter, Bob.

535
00:32:38.358 --> 00:32:39.594
"H." "H."

536
00:32:39.694 --> 00:32:41.028
Good.

537
00:32:42.362 --> 00:32:43.063
Again.

538
00:32:43.163 --> 00:32:44.732
Marcus, j-just let him go.

539
00:32:44.833 --> 00:32:46.200
We can play another game.

540
00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.068
Again.

541
00:32:48.903 --> 00:32:50.971
"E." "E." "E."

542
00:32:51.071 --> 00:32:52.740
-No.
-No, no, no!

543
00:32:56.945 --> 00:32:58.178
You're killing him!

544
00:32:58.278 --> 00:32:59.413
Stop it!

545
00:33:00.782 --> 00:33:03.450
I can't hear you.

546
00:33:21.836 --> 00:33:23.505
She's something.

547
00:33:24.806 --> 00:33:26.073
Dude!

548
00:33:26.173 --> 00:33:27.542
My bad.
That wasn't supposed to happen.

549
00:33:27.642 --> 00:33:30.678
I just didn't realize
her and Pete were so...

550
00:33:30.778 --> 00:33:32.479
close.

551
00:33:33.948 --> 00:33:36.718
Uh, yeah,
they grew up together.

552
00:33:37.719 --> 00:33:40.522
Oh, when's the big move?

553
00:33:42.022 --> 00:33:44.424
Well, um...

554
00:33:44.526 --> 00:33:49.229
we were thinking, like,
first week of June.

555
00:33:53.701 --> 00:33:55.937
Pete tell his parents?

556
00:33:56.036 --> 00:33:58.006
No, he's, like, kind of waiting

557
00:33:58.105 --> 00:33:59.908
till the last minute
sort of thing.

558
00:34:00.008 --> 00:34:01.408
But his parents are,
like, assholes.

559
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:04.111
- Oh, I'm shocked.
- Shut up.

560
00:34:04.211 --> 00:34:06.113
-Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug!
-Go, go! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

561
00:34:06.213 --> 00:34:08.650
I mean, you could always
come with me.

562
00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:11.553
To Smith?

563
00:34:11.653 --> 00:34:14.221
Uh, is that really
such a crazy idea?

564
00:34:14.321 --> 00:34:16.991
I mean, I think that it's
a little bit more stable

565
00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:19.027
than the other option.

566
00:34:19.126 --> 00:34:20.662
I love you.

567
00:34:20.762 --> 00:34:23.230
I know you do.

568
00:34:25.132 --> 00:34:27.334
Yo, so where you girls
been all my life?

569
00:34:27.434 --> 00:34:29.537
- Oh, no.
- Um...

570
00:34:29.637 --> 00:34:31.305
Oh, God.

571
00:34:31.405 --> 00:34:33.841
I'm-I'm gonna go find Pete.

572
00:34:33.942 --> 00:34:35.843
Okay. Go find Pete.

573
00:34:35.944 --> 00:34:37.712
He said he was taking a piss.

574
00:34:37.812 --> 00:34:39.781
Taking a piss.

575
00:34:43.651 --> 00:34:47.021
-What's up, Sophe?
-Don't even think about it.

576
00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.856
Okay.

577
00:35:15.016 --> 00:35:16.951
Come on, stop.

578
00:35:17.051 --> 00:35:18.653
Stop.

579
00:35:19.419 --> 00:35:21.254
What are you doing?

580
00:35:23.958 --> 00:35:25.760
I missed you.

581
00:35:27.095 --> 00:35:28.328
I missed you, too.

582
00:35:28.428 --> 00:35:30.732
- Did you?
- Yeah.

583
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:57.925
She's pretty cute, huh?

584
00:35:58.026 --> 00:35:59.761
Yeah, she's pretty hot.

585
00:36:01.361 --> 00:36:04.231
Yo, who invited this clown?

586
00:36:06.433 --> 00:36:08.335
He's here to get his ass
fucking kicked.

587
00:36:08.435 --> 00:36:11.039
Fuck's wrong with his face?

588
00:36:11.139 --> 00:36:12.406
God, Marcus.

589
00:36:12.507 --> 00:36:14.542
- Dude, holy shit.
- You're...

590
00:36:14.642 --> 00:36:16.644
bleeding.

591
00:36:16.744 --> 00:36:18.880
Hey, Sophie.

592
00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.380
Are you ready to play?

593
00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.684
What are you talking about?

594
00:36:23.685 --> 00:36:25.753
I will play.

595
00:36:25.853 --> 00:36:27.254
I won't quit.

596
00:36:27.354 --> 00:36:28.589
Are-are you on something?

597
00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:30.357
We need to get you
to a hospital.

598
00:36:30.457 --> 00:36:31.859
You a tweaker, Fletcher?

599
00:36:31.959 --> 00:36:33.061
- Shut up.
- Who is that?

600
00:36:33.161 --> 00:36:34.762
It's Billie's brother.

601
00:36:34.862 --> 00:36:37.197
Fletcher's high as fuck.
He carved an "X" in his head.

602
00:36:37.297 --> 00:36:39.332
You cool, bro?

603
00:36:40.601 --> 00:36:41.736
Hey, Pete.

604
00:36:41.836 --> 00:36:43.538
Are you ready to play?

605
00:36:47.041 --> 00:36:48.743
Marcus, why do you have
that knife?

606
00:36:48.843 --> 00:36:49.877
What the...

607
00:36:49.977 --> 00:36:51.813
What are knives usually for?

608
00:36:54.414 --> 00:36:55.950
Okay, you need to leave.

609
00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:57.852
This is private property.

610
00:37:00.054 --> 00:37:02.090
Did you hear me?

611
00:37:04.257 --> 00:37:07.360
Yes, I heard you.

612
00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:12.265
Your voice makes me want
to slit your throat.

613
00:37:12.365 --> 00:37:13.835
-Fuck did you just say?
-Who is...

614
00:37:13.935 --> 00:37:15.335
Marcus!

615
00:37:15.435 --> 00:37:17.337
Calm down, man! Let her go!

616
00:37:17.437 --> 00:37:19.272
Pete!
- We're calling
the cops, Fletcher.

617
00:37:19.372 --> 00:37:20.474
You're done.

618
00:37:20.575 --> 00:37:24.478
Put that phone in the fire.

619
00:37:24.579 --> 00:37:26.114
-Fuck you.
-Nick, stop.

620
00:37:26.214 --> 00:37:27.280
Now.

621
00:37:27.447 --> 00:37:28.716
- Nick, just do it!
- Shh.

622
00:37:28.783 --> 00:37:31.251
You owe me a fucking phone,
Fletcher.

623
00:37:32.053 --> 00:37:34.055
And the rest of you.

624
00:37:34.155 --> 00:37:36.858
Phones in the fire.

625
00:37:36.958 --> 00:37:38.626
Now.

626
00:37:38.726 --> 00:37:40.460
Fuck.

627
00:37:45.332 --> 00:37:46.768
Sophie.

628
00:37:46.868 --> 00:37:48.569
And you, Sophie.

629
00:37:52.874 --> 00:37:55.877
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?

630
00:37:55.977 --> 00:37:57.779
Because...

631
00:37:58.813 --> 00:38:01.448
...it's time to play...

632
00:38:01.549 --> 00:38:03.918
Shh.

633
00:38:06.453 --> 00:38:07.922
...hide-and-seek.

634
00:38:08.022 --> 00:38:10.258
-Maybe... maybe we can
talk about it.
-Yeah.

635
00:38:10.357 --> 00:38:11.926
Maybe we can figure
something out.

636
00:38:12.994 --> 00:38:15.129
Yeah, just let-let us know
what's going on. Maybe we...

637
00:38:15.229 --> 00:38:17.698
-Maybe we can help.
-Yeah. We can help.

638
00:38:18.431 --> 00:38:20.835
Shh.

639
00:38:20.935 --> 00:38:22.103
Pete.

640
00:38:22.203 --> 00:38:24.337
-Stop! No, stop!
-Stop!

641
00:38:24.437 --> 00:38:25.873
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

642
00:38:25.973 --> 00:38:28.475
-Ah, fuck! Fuck!
-Holy fuck.

643
00:38:28.576 --> 00:38:31.012
-Marcus, what are you
fucking doing?
-Oh, my God.

644
00:38:35.283 --> 00:38:37.885
Marcus, what the fuck
are you doing?

645
00:38:39.921 --> 00:38:41.656
Let's start.

646
00:38:41.756 --> 00:38:42.824
Start what?

647
00:38:42.924 --> 00:38:44.792
Ten.

648
00:38:47.862 --> 00:38:49.396
Nine.

649
00:38:50.598 --> 00:38:51.899
Eight.

650
00:38:52.834 --> 00:38:54.334
You're not playing.

651
00:38:54.434 --> 00:38:56.904
- What are we playing?
- Hide-and-seek.

652
00:38:57.004 --> 00:38:58.506
Go hide.

653
00:38:58.606 --> 00:38:59.874
Seven.

654
00:38:59.974 --> 00:39:01.441
Go.

655
00:39:01.542 --> 00:39:03.511
-Six.
-Hide!

656
00:39:03.611 --> 00:39:04.979
- Pete.
- Marcus!

657
00:39:05.079 --> 00:39:06.681
Pete, don't leave me.

658
00:39:06.781 --> 00:39:08.381
No, no! Pete!

659
00:39:08.481 --> 00:39:10.952
Marcus. Marcus.

660
00:39:11.052 --> 00:39:12.385
Five.

661
00:39:12.485 --> 00:39:14.555
-You got to let her go.
-Four.

662
00:39:14.655 --> 00:39:16.356
You got to let her go because
she-she's got to hide, right?

663
00:39:16.456 --> 00:39:17.725
And you want her to play,
so if you could...

664
00:39:17.825 --> 00:39:19.227
if she's gonna play,
you got to let her hide.

665
00:39:19.327 --> 00:39:20.528
Yeah, I want to play, Marcus.

666
00:39:20.628 --> 00:39:22.362
Please, please let me play.

667
00:39:22.462 --> 00:39:25.132
You got to let her go so...
so she can play.

668
00:39:41.883 --> 00:39:44.118
Marcus.

669
00:39:44.218 --> 00:39:45.686
Please.

670
00:39:51.192 --> 00:39:52.593
Go.

671
00:39:56.998 --> 00:39:59.100
Three.

672
00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.235
Two.

673
00:40:01.335 --> 00:40:03.070
One.

674
00:40:05.072 --> 00:40:07.508
Billie! Billie! Billie, Billie,

675
00:40:07.608 --> 00:40:09.442
-Billie, Billie, Billie.
-Jo? Jo.

676
00:40:09.543 --> 00:40:11.312
-Jo, what are you doing here?
-Billie. Billie.

677
00:40:11.411 --> 00:40:12.747
Bob's dead.

678
00:40:12.847 --> 00:40:13.814
What?

679
00:40:13.915 --> 00:40:15.516
Marcus killed him.

680
00:40:15.616 --> 00:40:17.518
Jo, this isn't funny, okay?

681
00:40:17.618 --> 00:40:21.856
Billie, Marcus killed Bob.

682
00:40:22.857 --> 00:40:24.191
He hung him.

683
00:40:24.292 --> 00:40:25.693
That's-that's enough, Jo, okay?

684
00:40:25.793 --> 00:40:28.829
I'm telling you the truth.
Just listen.

685
00:41:33.227 --> 00:41:36.163
-You left me, you fucking
piece of shit.
-Shh.

686
00:41:36.263 --> 00:41:38.866
We got to go. We got to go now!
Okay? We got to go.

687
00:41:38.966 --> 00:41:40.234
We got to go.

688
00:41:53.981 --> 00:41:56.183
He killed Bob. I...

689
00:41:56.283 --> 00:41:57.485
I saw it.

690
00:41:57.585 --> 00:41:59.053
Okay, okay. Okay, Jo.

691
00:41:59.153 --> 00:42:01.389
Jo.

692
00:42:01.489 --> 00:42:03.424
- You're scaring me, Jo.
- Billie!

693
00:42:03.524 --> 00:42:05.426
Billie! It's Marcus.

694
00:42:05.526 --> 00:42:07.294
It's Marcus. He's killing them.

695
00:42:07.395 --> 00:42:08.796
Okay, what-what is going on?

696
00:42:08.896 --> 00:42:10.564
Did you not hear what I said?

697
00:42:10.664 --> 00:42:12.233
I don't know,
maybe he's on something

698
00:42:12.333 --> 00:42:14.301
or someone drugged him, but...
his eyes, they were insane,

699
00:42:14.402 --> 00:42:16.570
and he made us all play
hide-and-seek,

700
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:18.172
and-and everyone ran, and he...

701
00:42:18.272 --> 00:42:20.041
and he... he's got the knife.

702
00:42:20.141 --> 00:42:22.109
He's got the knife,
and he's-he's looking for us,

703
00:42:22.209 --> 00:42:23.210
and we have to go.

704
00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:24.712
Are you kidding? Marcus?

705
00:42:24.812 --> 00:42:26.747
-Marcus wouldn't do that.
-I saw it!

706
00:42:26.847 --> 00:42:29.050
Look at me.
I'm covered in blood.

707
00:42:53.774 --> 00:42:55.176
We have to go.

708
00:42:55.276 --> 00:42:56.610
Give me your phone.
We have to call the police.

709
00:42:56.677 --> 00:42:57.745
Shit. My mom took it.

710
00:42:57.912 --> 00:42:59.413
Well, we can't go
to the police.

711
00:42:59.548 --> 00:43:00.981
If he's doing what
you're saying he's doing,

712
00:43:01.048 --> 00:43:02.783
if he's killing people,
what are we supposed to do?

713
00:43:02.883 --> 00:43:04.218
It's not him.

714
00:43:04.318 --> 00:43:06.287
He needs our help, Billie.

715
00:43:06.387 --> 00:43:07.922
How can we possibly help him?

716
00:43:08.022 --> 00:43:10.559
When-when we found the knife,
there was a book, a diary.

717
00:43:10.658 --> 00:43:12.059
We have to go!

718
00:43:12.159 --> 00:43:13.928
Where's the diary, Jo?

719
00:43:14.028 --> 00:43:16.897
Uh... it's...

720
00:43:16.997 --> 00:43:17.865
Follow me.

721
00:43:17.965 --> 00:43:20.034
I'll show you where I found it.

722
00:44:27.602 --> 00:44:28.969
I found you.

723
00:45:18.252 --> 00:45:20.187
Found you.

724
00:45:35.936 --> 00:45:37.871
Is that the diary, Jo?

725
00:45:37.972 --> 00:45:40.241
Yeah. That's it.

726
00:45:47.982 --> 00:45:51.151
"Diary of Joanna Good."

727
00:45:51.252 --> 00:45:53.387
1692?

728
00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:58.025
"He who proclaims it

729
00:45:58.125 --> 00:46:00.662
"shall provide the vessel.

730
00:46:00.761 --> 00:46:03.130
"The vessel be damned,

731
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:06.534
"cometh the strike
of the witch.

732
00:46:06.635 --> 00:46:08.670
"They call me the devil's whore

733
00:46:08.769 --> 00:46:13.708
"and claim my boy Daniel
is born of witchcraft.

734
00:46:13.807 --> 00:46:16.410
"The minister hath proclaimed

735
00:46:16.511 --> 00:46:19.748
"flames as our salvation,

736
00:46:19.847 --> 00:46:22.751
"vows to burn us at the stake.

737
00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:26.253
"They say I'm a witch.

738
00:46:27.488 --> 00:46:30.824
"Men came last night and carved

739
00:46:30.924 --> 00:46:33.827
the mark of the witch
upon my head"?

740
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:37.599
"I've fled with-with Daniel

741
00:46:37.699 --> 00:46:39.867
"into the deepest part
of the woods,

742
00:46:39.967 --> 00:46:41.869
"where no townsfolk dare go.

743
00:46:41.969 --> 00:46:44.238
"He turned 12 today.

744
00:46:45.105 --> 00:46:48.610
My only solace is in
keeping Daniel safe."

745
00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:03.190
"The vile children from
the township finally found him.

746
00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:08.763
"They lured him to play games
but only as a trick.

747
00:47:08.862 --> 00:47:10.431
"First, they carved an 'X'

748
00:47:10.532 --> 00:47:13.434
"in his head to mark him
like they marked me.

749
00:47:13.535 --> 00:47:16.937
"Then they played hangman
and hung him by his neck,

750
00:47:17.037 --> 00:47:18.540
"but he would not succumb.

751
00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:22.242
"They cut him down and made him
play hide-and-seek.

752
00:47:22.343 --> 00:47:25.846
When they found him, they
pulled his teeth one by one."

753
00:47:25.946 --> 00:47:27.881
This is fucked, Jo.
I don't want to read it.

754
00:47:27.981 --> 00:47:29.850
No, read it, Billie.
This might be

755
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:31.318
the only way
we can save Marcus.

756
00:47:31.418 --> 00:47:32.953
No, no. This is...
this is insane, okay?

757
00:47:33.053 --> 00:47:35.757
Read the book!
Read the book, read the book!

758
00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:39.927
-Read the book.
-Read the book!

759
00:47:40.027 --> 00:47:41.362
Read the book! Read the book!

760
00:47:41.462 --> 00:47:42.831
Read the book! Read the book!
Read the book!

761
00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:44.666
Read the book! Read the book!

762
00:47:54.642 --> 00:47:56.877
Keep reading.

763
00:47:58.879 --> 00:48:01.081
"When night fell, they chased

764
00:48:01.181 --> 00:48:04.318
"his crippled, beaten body
with torches, burning him.

765
00:48:04.418 --> 00:48:07.888
"At the last,
they ended his sad life.

766
00:48:07.988 --> 00:48:11.158
My dear sweet Daniel is dead."

767
00:48:12.493 --> 00:48:13.728
I-I...

768
00:48:13.828 --> 00:48:15.262
I will have vengeance.

769
00:48:15.362 --> 00:48:17.866
And those wicked,
callous children

770
00:48:17.965 --> 00:48:21.435
who wanted so badly
to play with my Daniel

771
00:48:21.536 --> 00:48:24.037
will play with him forever.

772
00:48:24.138 --> 00:48:26.907
For while I was not a witch

773
00:48:27.007 --> 00:48:29.644
when they accused me
of being so,

774
00:48:29.744 --> 00:48:31.912
I vow to become one,

775
00:48:32.012 --> 00:48:35.349
and they shall feel the wrath
of a real witch.

776
00:48:35.449 --> 00:48:39.687
I made the knife
from Daniel's bones

777
00:48:39.788 --> 00:48:42.657
and carved a curse
upon its blade.

778
00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:46.761
I brought that pointy reckoning
to those children

779
00:48:46.861 --> 00:48:49.062
and bade them play.

780
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:54.636
They said the curse aloud
and called my Daniel back.

781
00:49:00.107 --> 00:49:04.445
He played with them
like they played with him.

782
00:49:04.546 --> 00:49:08.716
And now they play forever.

783
00:49:08.817 --> 00:49:10.819
What-what about our brother?

784
00:49:10.919 --> 00:49:14.154
He will play. He won't quit.

785
00:49:15.155 --> 00:49:19.092
It only ends when Daniel wins.

786
00:49:20.093 --> 00:49:22.630
What if we win?

787
00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:31.873
What if we win?

788
00:49:39.079 --> 00:49:41.048
-Come back!
-Stop. Stop.

789
00:49:47.789 --> 00:49:49.356
What-what if we win?

790
00:49:49.456 --> 00:49:52.192
Those kids that played
with Daniel in the last game,

791
00:49:52.292 --> 00:49:55.162
they chased him and touched him
with torches, like...

792
00:49:56.698 --> 00:49:58.533
...tag.

793
00:49:59.667 --> 00:50:01.603
Like tag. I have an idea.

794
00:50:01.703 --> 00:50:03.671
- We need to go.
- Where?

795
00:50:03.771 --> 00:50:05.439
Home.

796
00:50:09.577 --> 00:50:12.179
How do we know
this is where he'll be?

797
00:50:13.548 --> 00:50:16.383
Only one way to find out.

798
00:50:39.574 --> 00:50:41.009
Sophe.

799
00:50:41.108 --> 00:50:42.777
-What do we do with these?
-Billie.

800
00:50:42.877 --> 00:50:44.278
Flashlight tag.

801
00:50:44.378 --> 00:50:46.614
We used to play
with our dad all the time.

802
00:50:46.714 --> 00:50:48.616
No one could beat Jo.

803
00:50:49.951 --> 00:50:52.052
Ready?

804
00:50:52.152 --> 00:50:53.655
-Yeah.
-Okay.

805
00:50:53.755 --> 00:50:55.723
Come on.

806
00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:14.642
Daniel, I want to play.

807
00:51:15.777 --> 00:51:18.513
Choose the game.

808
00:51:19.313 --> 00:51:20.582
The game.

809
00:51:20.682 --> 00:51:22.784
I hear you like tag.

810
00:51:22.884 --> 00:51:25.352
How about flashlight tag?

811
00:52:06.861 --> 00:52:08.696
Come on.

812
00:53:22.937 --> 00:53:24.772
Daniel?

813
00:55:19.887 --> 00:55:21.556
Fuck!

814
00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:31.364
Jo! Jo, stop!

815
00:55:31.464 --> 00:55:32.867
It burns, Jo!

816
00:55:32.967 --> 00:55:34.001
Jo, it's me!

817
00:55:34.101 --> 00:55:35.368
It's me! Stop!

818
00:55:35.468 --> 00:55:37.337
Please, Jo! Jo!

819
00:55:40.141 --> 00:55:41.876
Marcus?

820
00:56:00.862 --> 00:56:02.096
Be careful!

821
00:56:02.196 --> 00:56:04.599
If the light hits you,
it burns.

822
00:56:38.232 --> 00:56:39.634
Now!

823
00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:47.575
Keep your flashlights on him.

824
00:56:47.675 --> 00:56:49.944
I can't. I can't. I can't.

825
00:56:50.645 --> 00:56:52.880
Stop! Jo, it's Marcus. Come on.

826
00:56:55.216 --> 00:56:56.851
You guys, stop!

827
00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:23.978
He's breathing.

828
00:57:26.446 --> 00:57:27.381
Marcus.

829
00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:29.383
-Marcus!
-I'm it.

830
00:57:29.482 --> 00:57:31.953
Marcus! Marcus!

831
00:57:32.053 --> 00:57:34.889
- Marcus, please, please.
- Stop. Stop!

832
00:57:34.989 --> 00:57:36.691
Marcus, no!

833
00:57:48.402 --> 00:57:50.371
Okay.

834
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:52.239
Okay.

835
00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:54.008
Oh, what are we gonna do,
Billie?

836
00:57:54.108 --> 00:57:55.376
We're gonna die.

837
00:57:55.475 --> 00:57:57.445
We have to do something,
or he's gonna be damned!

838
00:57:57.545 --> 00:58:00.548
Marcus is damned.
Marcus is damned.

839
00:58:01.849 --> 00:58:03.250
If the curse is in the knife,

840
00:58:03.351 --> 00:58:04.585
maybe the knife
can break the curse.

841
00:58:04.685 --> 00:58:07.588
Let's play a new game.

842
00:58:07.688 --> 00:58:09.256
- Something really fun.
- The vessel.

843
00:58:09.357 --> 00:58:13.294
Marcus read the words on the
knife, he became the vessel.

844
00:58:13.394 --> 00:58:16.263
How about...

845
00:58:16.364 --> 00:58:19.800
red rover, Jo?

846
00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:21.502
Red rover.

847
00:58:21.602 --> 00:58:24.271
The knife. Marcus said
the words on the knife.

848
00:58:25.373 --> 00:58:27.274
Red rover.

849
00:58:27.375 --> 00:58:29.477
What's happening? Oh, no!

850
00:58:29.577 --> 00:58:32.513
-Help! Help me!
-Billie, snap out of it!

851
00:58:32.613 --> 00:58:35.950
Send Jonah...

852
00:58:36.050 --> 00:58:38.085
right over.

853
00:58:41.222 --> 00:58:42.556
- I will play.
- What?

854
00:58:42.656 --> 00:58:44.358
-I won't quit.
-Stop, stop, stop!

855
00:58:44.458 --> 00:58:46.327
-Tell me, demon...
-No, Billie!

856
00:58:46.427 --> 00:58:47.995
...am I it?

857
00:59:07.715 --> 00:59:10.351
I will play. I won't quit.

858
00:59:10.451 --> 00:59:14.288
Tell me, demon, am I it?

859
00:59:14.388 --> 00:59:16.390
Am I it?

860
00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:20.795
Am I it? Am I it?

861
00:59:55.229 --> 00:59:56.897
Marcus?

862
00:59:56.997 --> 00:59:58.232
Wake up, please.

863
01:00:03.471 --> 01:00:04.972
It's okay.

864
01:00:05.072 --> 01:00:07.374
Marcus! It's okay.
It's-it's me.

865
01:00:07.475 --> 01:00:08.709
It's me. It's me.

866
01:00:08.809 --> 01:00:10.344
-Okay? You're okay.
-Jo. Jo.

867
01:00:10.444 --> 01:00:12.480
-You're okay, okay? Okay?
-Jo.

868
01:00:12.581 --> 01:00:14.615
-Am I... am I back?
-Hey.

869
01:00:14.715 --> 01:00:16.650
-You're back.
-Jo.

870
01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:18.853
-Oh, Jo.
-Hey.

871
01:00:18.953 --> 01:00:20.287
Am I back?

872
01:00:27.261 --> 01:00:28.996
Sophe.

873
01:00:32.366 --> 01:00:34.068
Where's Billie?

874
01:00:35.336 --> 01:00:37.138
Where's Billie?

875
01:00:38.272 --> 01:00:40.141
Billie?

876
01:00:57.858 --> 01:01:00.094
We've been waiting for you.

877
01:01:00.761 --> 01:01:02.830
Now you can play with us.

878
01:01:05.966 --> 01:01:10.771
You will play. You won't quit.

879
01:01:15.809 --> 01:01:18.712
♪ Ring around the rosie,
a pocket full of posies ♪

880
01:01:18.812 --> 01:01:21.916
♪ Ashes, ashes,
we all fall down. ♪

881
01:01:30.858 --> 01:01:34.695
Let me mark you.

882
01:01:34.795 --> 01:01:37.498
And then you can play with me.

883
01:01:49.143 --> 01:01:50.911
Billie?

884
01:01:51.011 --> 01:01:53.881
It's me, Sophe. Turn that off.

885
01:01:54.882 --> 01:01:57.051
What happened?

886
01:01:57.151 --> 01:02:00.421
I was hurting him,
and I was gonna kill him.

887
01:02:03.791 --> 01:02:06.093
But then I woke up here.

888
01:02:08.195 --> 01:02:09.830
Billie.

889
01:02:11.165 --> 01:02:12.366
Marcus.

890
01:02:21.676 --> 01:02:23.310
Shit.

891
01:03:04.686 --> 01:03:06.153
No, wait, B-Billie, stop.

892
01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:18.399
Jo. Wait, wait, Jo, wait!

893
01:03:18.499 --> 01:03:19.900
Come on.

894
01:03:29.644 --> 01:03:31.478
Shh.

895
01:03:34.683 --> 01:03:36.083
Wait, wait, wait.

896
01:03:36.183 --> 01:03:37.484
Okay.

897
01:04:02.276 --> 01:04:04.011
Wait. Wait.

898
01:04:06.614 --> 01:04:09.116
-Okay.
-Yeah, go.

899
01:04:29.637 --> 01:04:31.872
Play!

900
01:04:34.041 --> 01:04:35.909
No, no, no, no, no, no!

901
01:04:41.315 --> 01:04:43.250
It won't open!

902
01:04:43.350 --> 01:04:44.451
Fuck!

903
01:04:47.121 --> 01:04:48.889
Come on.

904
01:05:29.229 --> 01:05:31.231
Marcus, help!

905
01:05:31.331 --> 01:05:32.232
What did I do?

906
01:05:32.332 --> 01:05:34.134
What are you doing? Come on!

907
01:05:38.939 --> 01:05:40.974
I killed Uncle Bob.

908
01:05:41.776 --> 01:05:42.844
What?

909
01:05:42.943 --> 01:05:45.045
And I killed Pete.

910
01:05:46.947 --> 01:05:48.783
No, you-you didn't do that.

911
01:05:48.883 --> 01:05:51.118
That wasn't you.

912
01:05:51.218 --> 01:05:53.621
I fucking did it.
I fucking did it.

913
01:05:53.721 --> 01:05:55.989
That was the demon.

914
01:06:05.365 --> 01:06:07.100
Get up! Get up!

915
01:06:23.885 --> 01:06:26.420
Marcus, snap out of it!

916
01:06:29.557 --> 01:06:30.959
Let me mark you!

917
01:06:31.058 --> 01:06:32.125
Get off me!

918
01:06:32.292 --> 01:06:34.127
-Help me!
-Marcus, help! Now!

919
01:06:34.194 --> 01:06:36.163
-Let me mark you!
-No!

920
01:06:36.965 --> 01:06:38.700
Marcus!

921
01:06:40.167 --> 01:06:44.371
So we can play forever.

922
01:06:51.311 --> 01:06:53.515
-Help!
-I want to play.

923
01:06:54.983 --> 01:06:56.951
-No.
-Jo.

924
01:07:01.054 --> 01:07:02.757
- Red rover.
- No.

925
01:07:02.857 --> 01:07:05.225
Jo, no.

926
01:07:06.561 --> 01:07:09.162
Red rover, red rover...

927
01:07:13.968 --> 01:07:16.871
Let me mark you.

928
01:07:16.971 --> 01:07:19.841
...send Daniel...

929
01:07:19.941 --> 01:07:22.376
No. Jo, no.

930
01:07:22.476 --> 01:07:24.378
...right over.

931
01:07:29.517 --> 01:07:31.586
Mama. Mama.

932
01:07:31.686 --> 01:07:32.954
Please.

933
01:07:33.053 --> 01:07:34.388
Ma...

934
01:07:36.056 --> 01:07:38.258
Mama.

935
01:07:40.962 --> 01:07:42.597
Mama.

936
01:07:42.697 --> 01:07:44.632
Ma...

937
01:07:54.642 --> 01:07:55.877
Mama.

938
01:08:46.493 --> 01:08:48.395
Even here in Salem,

939
01:08:48.495 --> 01:08:51.398
they didn't teach us
all our history.

940
01:08:51.498 --> 01:08:54.502
Some stories got lost
along the way.

941
01:08:56.169 --> 01:08:59.439
Until one of them found us.

942
01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:01.843
Or really...

943
01:09:01.943 --> 01:09:04.177
we found it.

944
01:09:19.861 --> 01:09:21.863
Marcus turned himself in.

945
01:09:23.097 --> 01:09:25.465
And now we're waiting
for the trial.

946
01:09:27.068 --> 01:09:31.271
One more story in Salem where
no one believed the truth.

947
01:09:36.376 --> 01:09:38.478
But it didn't matter.

948
01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:41.716
We knew what really happened.

949
01:09:44.118 --> 01:09:46.654
People say it'll make
our family stronger,

950
01:09:46.754 --> 01:09:48.790
but I don't know.

951
01:09:53.027 --> 01:09:55.362
That's the thing with trauma.

952
01:09:55.462 --> 01:09:58.633
Even after you face it,

953
01:09:58.733 --> 01:10:01.435
you have to learn
to live with it,

954
01:10:01.536 --> 01:10:04.072
even if you don't want to.

955
01:10:04.172 --> 01:10:07.207
Even if it wasn't yours
to begin with.
