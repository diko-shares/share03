both of us to watch him.

178
00:10:06.073 --> 00:10:07.741
He had plans.
I made him cancel.

179
00:10:07.842 --> 00:10:09.343
I'm making you cancel, too.

180
00:10:09.443 --> 00:10:10.811
What plans? What plans?

181
00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:12.581
He gets high in
Randy's basement and pretends

182
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.181
to be in a band
that nobody's ever heard of.

183
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:16.183
I don't want to argue with you
every time I ask you

184
00:10:16.283 --> 00:10:17.618
to do something, okay, Billie?
I'm tired.

185
00:10:17.718 --> 00:10:19.019
It'll be like two hours.
Please.

186
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.754
-This is so unfair.
-(scoffs)

187
00:10:20.855 --> 00:10:22.557
You know what's unfair?

188
00:10:22.656 --> 00:10:24.191
-Okay, I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

189
00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:25.594
I need you, kiddo, okay?

190
00:10:25.693 --> 00:10:28.896
You're the only one
I can depend on.

191
00:10:29.697 --> 00:10:30.898
Jesus Christ.

192
00:10:30.998 --> 00:10:32.800
-Marcus, what happened?
-I tripped.

193
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.503
-Jo?
-He kicked
Nick Libertini's ass.

194
00:10:34.603 --> 00:10:37.238
-This is why I can't leave
these two alone.
-It was cool.

195
00:10:37.338 --> 00:10:39.740
Marcus has to grow up, okay?
You can't keep coddling...

196
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.275
Are you busting Mom's balls
'cause you want

197
00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:43.344
to go fuck your boyfriend
in the woods tonight?

198
00:10:43.444 --> 00:10:44.645
Wha... (scoffs)

199
00:10:44.745 --> 00:10:46.113
-You're an asshole.
-KATHY: Marcus.

200
00:10:46.213 --> 00:10:47.681
-Hey, at least I'm
fucking somebody.
-Fuck you.

201
00:10:47.781 --> 00:10:49.049
KATHY: You know what?
Okay, both of you,

202
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.585
your phones right now--
give them to me.

203
00:10:50.684 --> 00:10:52.319
-What? No.
-Seriously?

204
00:10:52.554 --> 00:10:54.221
-I warned you about language
in front of your brother.
-Mom.

205
00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:55.656
Okay, how are we supposed
to watch Jo without our phones?

206
00:10:55.723 --> 00:10:57.224
I don't know. Be present?

207
00:10:57.324 --> 00:11:00.094
And if there's an emergency,
use the landline.

208
00:11:00.194 --> 00:11:01.563
Come on.

209
00:11:01.662 --> 00:11:03.164
Now.

210
00:11:03.264 --> 00:11:04.932
(Billie scoffs)

211
00:11:05.032 --> 00:11:08.002
Just so you know, I'm moving to
New York this summer with Pete.

212
00:11:08.102 --> 00:11:09.904
You've got to be the dumbest
smart person I know.

213
00:11:10.004 --> 00:11:11.640
BILLIE: Yeah? And why is that?
Because I actually want to get

214
00:11:11.805 --> 00:11:13.575
out of here and I'm actually
doing something about it?

215
00:11:13.642 --> 00:11:15.510
No, because all you do is

216
00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.144
follow that guy around
like a puppy.

217
00:11:17.244 --> 00:11:19.747
-You're moving?
-No, she is not moving, okay?

218
00:11:19.847 --> 00:11:21.215
Please don't upset
your brother.

219
00:11:21.315 --> 00:11:22.383
He doesn't care about me.

220
00:11:22.483 --> 00:11:23.851
-Can I have your room?
-See?

221
00:11:23.951 --> 00:11:25.152
MARCUS: So, you're dropping out
of high school

222
00:11:25.252 --> 00:11:27.755
to move in
with some spoiled fuckboy

223
00:11:27.855 --> 00:11:30.224
who is gonna drop you
the first chance he gets?

224
00:11:30.324 --> 00:11:32.126
And yeah, where is
your future going, dumbass?

225
00:11:32.226 --> 00:11:34.596
What, are you gonna pump gas
with those ACT scores?

226
00:11:34.695 --> 00:11:37.198
Or-or maybe the next time

227
00:11:37.298 --> 00:11:38.999
that you beat the shit
out of somebody,

228
00:11:39.099 --> 00:11:41.503
they press charges
and you go to jail.

229
00:11:41.603 --> 00:11:43.103
Or worse, an asylum.

230
00:11:43.204 --> 00:11:44.471
-Yeah.
-Psycho.

231
00:11:44.573 --> 00:11:46.407
KATHY:
Okay, Billie, that is enough.

232
00:11:46.508 --> 00:11:48.610
Mom, please don't
do this to me.

233
00:11:48.709 --> 00:11:50.144
You'll be okay.

234
00:11:50.244 --> 00:11:53.180
I'm late. Please take Marcus
some ice for his lip,

235
00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.883
and make sure Uncle Bob
doesn't smoke in the house.

236
00:11:55.983 --> 00:11:57.818
Is there anything else
you want to add to the list?

237
00:11:57.918 --> 00:12:00.120
-Uh, yes.
-(Billie scoffs)

238
00:12:00.221 --> 00:12:02.356

239
00:12:03.357 --> 00:12:04.391

He didn't give it to me.

00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:51.258
You know what I think
we should do right now?

355
00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:53.226
-Hmm?
-Get out of here,
go to the party.

356
00:19:53.326 --> 00:19:54.862
-Come on, let's go, babe.
-I can't. I can't.

357
00:19:54.962 --> 00:19:56.329
I told you I have to watch Jo.

358
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:57.765
PETE: What time does
your mom get home?

359
00:19:57.865 --> 00:20:00.367
-BILLIE: Like 2:00 a.m.
-(scoffs) 2:00 a.m.

360
00:20:00.467 --> 00:20:02.402
I'll have you back
way before then.

361
00:20:02.503 --> 00:20:04.839
She's supposed to be
watching me.

362
00:20:04.939 --> 00:20:06.273
-Um... (laughs)
-You tell him.

363
00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.842
You don't need anybody
watching you, little man.

364
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:09.309
You're like 13.

365
00:20:09.476 --> 00:20:11.211
BILLIE: I mean, it's cool.
We can just, like, chill.

366
00:20:11.278 --> 00:20:13.380
Here, have a drink.
Listen to some music.

367
00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.149
Just one drink, Sophie.

368
00:20:15.248 --> 00:20:16.884
-Are you peer-pressuring me?
-No.

369
00:20:16.984 --> 00:20:18.820
-(can pops open)
-It's working.

370
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.220
(knocking)

371
00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.823
MAN: Hey, you kids
got I.D. in there?

372
00:20:21.923 --> 00:20:23.558
Ah...

373
00:20:23.658 --> 00:20:25.893
-(laughs) What up, Bobby?
-BOB: Hey, Pedro.

374
00:20:25.993 --> 00:20:27.427
-SOPHIE: Hi.
-Oh, don't worry.

375
00:20:27.528 --> 00:20:28.830
I'm not looking.
Don't worry. Don't worry.

376
00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.497
Just kidding. Give me
a fucking beer. Come on.

377
00:20:30.598 --> 00:20:32.033
-Ah... (grunts)
-Hey! Oh!

378
00:20:32.133 --> 00:20:33.768
-Thank you.
-BILLIE: Uh, hey, Bob.

379
00:20:33.868 --> 00:20:36.003
Remember Mom doesn't like you
smoking in the house?

380
00:20:36.104 --> 00:20:38.305
Mm. Open a window.

381
00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:39.540
Dude, come on.

382
00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.308
-Jo's right there.
-Fine.

383
00:20:41.408 --> 00:20:42.577
But maybe Marco
might want a little...

384
00:20:42.677 --> 00:20:44.779
-BILLIE: No. No, put it out.
-Why?

385
00:20:44.879 --> 00:20:45.980
No, seriously, come on.

386
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.414
-Stop showing off.
-Okay, Mom.

387
00:20:47.582 --> 00:20:50.051
-Okay, immature. Come on.
-Hey. (clicks tongue)

388
00:20:50.118 --> 00:20:52.319
-Thank you.
-MARCUS: Hit that.

389
00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:53.688
(eerie voices whispering
indistinctly)

390
00:20:53.788 --> 00:20:55.388
-PETE (muffled): Yo, Bobby.
-BOB: Hmm?

391
00:20:55.489 --> 00:20:56.824
PETE: You want to go
to the party with us tonight?

392
00:20:56.924 --> 00:20:58.960
(chatter continues,
muffled and indistinct)

393
00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.327
It's not a good look, buddy.

394
00:21:00.427 --> 00:21:02.096
-You can pull it off.
-Oh, thank you.

395
00:21:02.196 --> 00:21:03.765
Marcus, what do you say?
You down?

396
00:21:03.865 --> 00:21:05.199
-What?
-Okay, no.

397
00:21:05.298 --> 00:21:06.768
He's... he's not invited.

398
00:21:06.868 --> 00:21:08.435
-I just got invited.
-PETE: You're invited.

399
00:21:08.536 --> 00:21:10.437
I'm invited. There we go.

400
00:21:10.538 --> 00:21:12.472
-No. Get your own plans.
-Come on, babe.

401
00:21:12.573 --> 00:21:14.142
Don't be mean.
I want to come to a party.

402
00:21:14.242 --> 00:21:15.408
What are your friends doing?
Oh, I forgot.

403
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:16.644
-You don't have any.
-Oh, fuck you.

404
00:21:16.744 --> 00:21:17.912
-My friends are busy.
-Oh, ouch.

405
00:21:18.012 --> 00:21:19.379
Yeah, I want to go to a party.

406
00:21:19.479 --> 00:21:20.615
Why should I stay here
when you get to go out?

407
00:21:20.715 --> 00:21:22.183
Uh, because somebody
has to watch Jo.

408
00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:23.551
-Bob.
-Huh? What?

409
00:21:23.618 --> 00:21:24.952
-BILLIE: What? What?
-You can watch Jo, right?

410
00:21:25.019 --> 00:21:26.721
-BILLIE: Are you kidding?
-SOPHIE: Are you crazy?

411
00:21:26.821 --> 00:21:27.889
-(snickering)
-MARCUS: Bob... He's an adult.

412
00:21:27.989 --> 00:21:29.190
I am technically an adult.

413
00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:30.490
-Hardly. No.
-I am an adult.

414
00:21:30.591 --> 00:21:31.926
Come on. Don't be mean.

415
00:21:32.026 --> 00:21:33.728
Jo, you don't mind, right?

416
00:21:33.828 --> 00:21:35.395
(conversation continues,
muffled and indistinct)

417
00:21:35.495 --> 00:21:37.799
(indistinct,
demonic whispering)

418
00:21:37.899 --> 00:21:39.332
BILLIE (muffled):
Okay, fine. Fine.

419
00:21:39.432 --> 00:21:41.235
Bob, you're watching Jo.

420
00:21:41.334 --> 00:21:43.104
(muffled, indistinct chatter)

421
00:21:43.204 --> 00:21:46.339
EERIE VOICE:
Don't let them leave.

422
00:21:47.141 --> 00:21:48.341
DEMONIC VOICE:
Hey!

423
00:21:48.441 --> 00:21:50.211
EERIE VOICE:
Make them play.

424
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.346
-Make them play.
-(distorted screaming)

425
00:21:53.446 --> 00:21:55.382
No one's going anywhere.

426
00:21:57.185 --> 00:21:59.954
You guys leave, I call Mom.

427
00:22:00.054 --> 00:22:01.289
Whoa. Not cool, dude.

428
00:22:01.388 --> 00:22:02.557
Jo, we'll have a good time,
all right?

429
00:22:02.723 --> 00:22:05.392
Mom doesn't want Bob
looking after me.

430
00:22:05.458 --> 00:22:06.928
She thinks he's a fuckup.

431
00:22:07.028 --> 00:22:09.263
-Whoa. Okay, Jo.
-BOB: What did you call me?

432
00:22:09.362 --> 00:22:10.665
-PETE: Dude. -Hey.
-BILLIE: Jo, language.

433
00:22:10.765 --> 00:22:12.499
-Come on, don't be like that.
-Like what?

434
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.369
Someone you can move
to New York to get away from?

435
00:22:16.469 --> 00:22:19.307
Or someone Marcus can blame
for all of his problems?

436
00:22:19.406 --> 00:22:20.942
Hey, that's not fair.

437
00:22:21.042 --> 00:22:22.342
JONAH:
What's not fair?

438
00:22:22.442 --> 00:22:23.578
That I'm your only friend

439
00:22:23.678 --> 00:22:25.179
and you still treat me
like shit?

440
00:22:25.279 --> 00:22:26.881
What the fuck? What's up?

441
00:22:26.981 --> 00:22:28.816
You all want to leave me,
and I won't let you.

442
00:22:28.916 --> 00:22:30.383
-Uh... Jo.
-We're...

443
00:22:30.483 --> 00:22:31.853
-We're just going to a party.
-Yeah. We're not...

444
00:22:31.953 --> 00:22:33.821
-We'll be back.
-Yeah, we're not leaving you.

445
00:22:33.921 --> 00:22:35.455
-Yeah.
-Uh, you can just
hang here with Bob.

446
00:22:35.556 --> 00:22:37.258
Play some games.
Play "Fortnite."

447
00:22:37.357 --> 00:22:39.760
I don't want to play
"Fortnite."

448
00:22:40.895 --> 00:22:43.998
I want to play
a different game.

449
00:22:44.098 --> 00:22:47.301
If you play with me, then
I'll let you go to your party

450
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.770
and I won't call Mom.

451
00:22:49.871 --> 00:22:51.105
BILLIE:
Okay, Jo.

452
00:22:51.205 --> 00:22:53.841
What game do you want to play,
hmm?

453
00:22:56.077 --> 00:22:58.946
♪ ♪

454
00:23:04.484 --> 00:23:07.855
Come on, babe. I'm not playing
duck, duck, goose.

455
00:23:07.955 --> 00:23:09.924
Just humor him.

456
00:23:10.024 --> 00:23:11.926
I just want to go on record
that I'm not

457
00:23:12.026 --> 00:23:15.062
really good at games,
but I'll try my best, Jo.

458
00:23:16.063 --> 00:23:17.031
You, too, Bob.

459
00:23:17.131 --> 00:23:18.566
Uh, I'll be the judge.

EERIE VOICE: You'll tell Mom
about the money.

461
00:23:21.135 --> 00:23:23.170
I'll tell Mom about the money.

462
00:23:24.471 --> 00:23:26.140
What money?

463
00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.176
That you steal from her purse
when she's not looking.

464
00:23:30.511 --> 00:23:32.412
You're a little asshole
sometimes, you know that?

465
00:23:32.513 --> 00:23:33.446
He's a kid.

466
00:23:33.547 --> 00:23:34.582
Jo. Come on.

467
00:23:34.682 --> 00:23:35.950
How do we play this game?

-(eerie voice whispering)
-One by one,

469
00:23:38.451 --> 00:23:43.190
you'll all say,
"I will play. I won't quit."

Jonah, I swear, if you're
playing a trick on us,

482
00:24:16.324 --> 00:24:18.292
it's not funny.

483
00:24:18.392 --> 00:24:20.161

-Okay.

they're tapping the keg.

We're not done yet.

Game's over, Jo, okay?

490
00:24:33.007 --> 00:24:34.474
We're leaving now.

No, it's fine.

Okay. Cool.
