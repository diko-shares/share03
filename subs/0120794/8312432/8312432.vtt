Faster, you beasts!
You run like mules!

69
00:08:51.324 --> 00:08:52.325
Hey, Ramses,

70
00:08:52.868 --> 00:08:55.036
how would you like
your face carved on a wall?

71
00:08:55.287 --> 00:08:56.496
Someday, yes.

72
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.706
How about now?

73
00:09:03.128 --> 00:09:04.212
You almost killed me!

74
00:09:04.296 --> 00:09:05.338
Aw, come on.

75
00:09:05.422 --> 00:09:06.798
Where is your sense of fun?

76
00:09:06.965 --> 00:09:08.675
Oh, it's fun you want.

77
00:09:24.274 --> 00:09:25.483
Moses?

78
00:09:47.255 --> 00:09:50.133
Come on, Moses. Admit it.
You've always looked up to me.

79
00:09:50.216 --> 00:09:52.594
Yes, but it's not
much of a view.

80
00:09:54.095 --> 00:09:55.138
Hyah!

81
00:09:59.225 --> 00:10:00.226
Hey!

82
00:10:00.727 --> 00:10:02.896
Second born,
second place.

83
00:10:02.979 --> 00:10:04.564
Not for long.

84
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.521
Jump!

85
00:11:29.274 --> 00:11:31.276
You don't think we'll get in
trouble for this, do you?

86
00:11:31.359 --> 00:11:33.445
No, not a chance.

87
00:11:34.446 --> 00:11:37.073
Why do the gods
torment me

88
00:11:37.157 --> 00:11:39.659
with such reckless,
destructive,

89
00:11:39.743 --> 00:11:41.411
blasphemous sons?

90
00:11:41.494 --> 00:11:42.495
Father,
hear what I...

91
00:11:42.579 --> 00:11:45.040
Be still! Pharaoh speaks.

92
00:11:46.624 --> 00:11:49.252
I seek to build an empire,

93
00:11:49.377 --> 00:11:52.297
and your only thought
is to amuse yourselves

94
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.007
by tearing it down.

95
00:11:54.466 --> 00:11:55.967
Have I taught you nothing?

96
00:11:56.051 --> 00:11:58.511
You mustn't be so hard on yourself,
Your Majesty.

97
00:11:58.595 --> 00:11:59.846
You're an excellent teacher.

98
00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.475
It's not your fault
your sons learned nothing.

99
00:12:03.558 --> 00:12:05.393
- Well, they learned blasphemy.
- True.

100
00:12:05.727 --> 00:12:08.605
Father, the fault is mine.

101
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:10.065
I goaded Ramses on,

102
00:12:10.148 --> 00:12:11.733
and so I am responsible.

103
00:12:11.858 --> 00:12:13.985
Hmm. "Responsible."

104
00:12:14.319 --> 00:12:17.447
And do you know the meaning
of that word, Ramses?

105
00:12:17.739 --> 00:12:18.990
I understand, Father...

106
00:12:19.074 --> 00:12:21.409
And do you
understand the task

107
00:12:21.493 --> 00:12:23.703
for which your birth
has destined you?

108
00:12:24.037 --> 00:12:26.331
The ancient traditions.

109
00:12:26.539 --> 00:12:28.374
When I pass into
the next world,

110
00:12:28.458 --> 00:12:31.336
then you will be
the morning and evening star.

111
00:12:31.544 --> 00:12:33.296
One damaged temple
does not destroy

112
00:12:33.379 --> 00:12:34.464
centuries of tradition.

113
00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:36.007
But one weak link

114
00:12:36.091 --> 00:12:39.552
can break the chain
of a mighty dynasty!

115
00:12:50.063 --> 00:12:51.940
You have my leave to go.

116
00:12:52.524 --> 00:12:53.858
Father.

117
00:13:08.373 --> 00:13:09.707
Father?

118
00:13:11.042 --> 00:13:13.253
You know it was
really my fault.

119
00:13:13.753 --> 00:13:16.297
Must you be so hard on him?

120
00:13:16.631 --> 00:13:20.260
Moses, you will never
have to carry a burden

121
00:13:20.343 --> 00:13:23.096
like the crown I will pass
to Ramses.

122
00:13:23.388 --> 00:13:28.309
He must not allow himself
to be led astray,

123
00:13:28.643 --> 00:13:31.146
not even by you, my son.

124
00:13:33.022 --> 00:13:36.860
All he cares about
is your approval.

125
00:13:36.943 --> 00:13:39.571
I know he will live up
to your expectations.

126
00:13:39.779 --> 00:13:42.073
He only needs
the opportunity.

127
00:13:42.282 --> 00:13:43.992
Maybe.

128
00:13:44.284 --> 00:13:45.827
Maybe so.

129
00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.163
Go now.

130
00:13:48.246 --> 00:13:50.874
I shall see you both tonight.

131
00:14:04.679 --> 00:14:05.930
Well, that went well.

132
00:14:06.014 --> 00:14:07.515
Just go away.

133
00:14:07.849 --> 00:14:09.058
Could have been worse.

134
00:14:09.142 --> 00:14:11.186
"The weak link
in the chain."

135
00:14:11.728 --> 00:14:13.188
That's what he called me.

136
00:14:15.315 --> 00:14:18.359
Well, you are rather pathetic.

137
00:14:18.693 --> 00:14:21.487
Irresponsible,
ignorant of the traditions.

138
00:14:21.571 --> 00:14:24.449
He practically accused me
of bringing down the dynasty.

139
00:14:24.532 --> 00:14:27.118
Yeah, I can see it now.
There go the pyramids!

140
00:14:28.995 --> 00:14:30.705
You can laugh about it.

141
00:14:30.788 --> 00:14:32.624
Statues cracking
and toppling over,

142
00:14:32.707 --> 00:14:34.042
the Nile drying up.

143
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.002
Single-handedly,

144
00:14:36.085 --> 00:14:39.380
you will manage to bring the greatest
kingdom on Earth to ruin.

145
00:14:39.464 --> 00:14:40.673
Tell me this, Moses.
Tell me this.

146
00:14:40.757 --> 00:14:43.384
Why is it that every time
you start something,

147
00:14:43.468 --> 00:14:45.803
I'm the one who
ends up in trouble?

148
00:14:48.264 --> 00:14:49.515
Man! Oh!

149
00:14:50.391 --> 00:14:51.392
It's Ramses.

150
00:14:51.476 --> 00:14:52.602
You're in trouble,
young man.

151
00:14:52.685 --> 00:14:53.686
Ramses, get down here!

152
00:14:53.811 --> 00:14:55.813
- I think you owe us an apology!
- Oh!

153
00:14:55.897 --> 00:14:57.440
My new thing!

154
00:14:57.523 --> 00:14:58.983
I am so upset!

155
00:14:59.067 --> 00:15:01.110
- You might as well.
- You'll pay for this!

156
00:15:01.194 --> 00:15:02.445
We're gonna
tell the pharaoh!

157
00:15:02.528 --> 00:15:04.489
We're telling
the pharaoh and that's...

158
00:15:04.614 --> 00:15:07.075
Oh!

159
00:15:07.158 --> 00:15:08.701
Look at me.
I'm drenched again.

160
00:15:08.785 --> 00:15:10.328
Hey, I figured it out.

161
00:15:10.578 --> 00:15:12.163
You know what your
problem is, Ramses?

162
00:15:12.247 --> 00:15:14.415
- What?
- You care too much.

163
00:15:14.791 --> 00:15:17.126
And your problem is
you don't care at all.

164
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.879
Oh, in that case, I suppose you
care a lot more than I do

165
00:15:19.963 --> 00:15:22.799
that we're late for the banquet,
for example.

166
00:15:26.844 --> 00:15:29.097
I'm done for.
Father will kill me.

167
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.723
Don't worry.

168
00:15:31.015 --> 00:15:33.434
Nobody will even
notice us coming in.

169
00:15:38.898 --> 00:15:41.317
"Nobody will even notice."

170
00:15:43.945 --> 00:15:46.114
Ah, the young princes.

171
00:15:46.906 --> 00:15:50.243
Ramses, you were just named
Prince regent.

172
00:15:50.326 --> 00:15:54.080
You are now responsible for
overseeing all the temples.

173
00:15:54.163 --> 00:15:57.292
I suggest you get over there,

174
00:15:57.375 --> 00:16:00.169
and thank your father.

175
00:16:00.628 --> 00:16:02.380
Apparently, Moses,

176
00:16:02.463 --> 00:16:07.552
someone thought he just
needed the opportunity.

177
00:16:10.471 --> 00:16:11.514
My lord Pharaoh,

178
00:16:11.931 --> 00:16:14.517
I propose that the high
priests offer tribute

179
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.185
to their new regent.

180
00:16:16.352 --> 00:16:19.105
- An excellent idea.
- Hotep, Huy!

181
00:16:19.188 --> 00:16:20.857
- Huy.
- Hmm?

182
00:16:21.065 --> 00:16:23.443
- The Midian girl.
- That's a good idea.

183
00:16:23.526 --> 00:16:24.861
Go get her.

184
00:16:25.987 --> 00:16:28.323
By the power of Ra,

185
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.868
we present for your
delectation and delight

186
00:16:31.951 --> 00:16:36.289
an exotic apparition
stolen from a faraway land.

187
00:16:44.255 --> 00:16:47.508
We offer you
this delicate desert flower.

188
00:16:54.682 --> 00:16:57.518
Let us inspect
this desert flower.

189
00:17:00.271 --> 00:17:02.482
More like a desert cobra.

190
00:17:02.565 --> 00:17:04.442
Not much of a snake charmer,
are you?

191
00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:06.903
That's why I give her to you.

192
00:17:06.986 --> 00:17:08.321
No, no, no,
that's generous, but...

193
00:17:08.404 --> 00:17:10.656
I won't be
given to anyone.

194
00:17:10.907 --> 00:17:13.826
Especially an arrogant,
pampered palace brat!

195
00:17:14.202 --> 00:17:16.371
Are you gonna
let her talk to you like that?

196
00:17:16.496 --> 00:17:18.998
You will show the proper respect

197
00:17:19.082 --> 00:17:20.375
for a Prince of Egypt.

198
00:17:20.458 --> 00:17:24.545
But I am showing you
all the respect you deserve.
None!

199
00:17:25.713 --> 00:17:27.298
No. Wait!

200
00:17:27.715 --> 00:17:29.550
- Be still.
- Untie this rope!

201
00:17:29.634 --> 00:17:30.927
I demand you set me free!

202
00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.096
- Be still.
- Let go!

203
00:17:33.721 --> 00:17:35.139
As you wish.

204
00:17:48.653 --> 00:17:49.779
You there,

205
00:17:49.862 --> 00:17:51.155
have her dried off

206
00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.409
and sent to Prince Moses' chambers.

207
00:17:54.784 --> 00:17:56.911
If it pleases you, Father,

208
00:17:56.994 --> 00:17:59.080
my first act as regent

209
00:17:59.163 --> 00:18:01.249
is to appoint Moses

210
00:18:01.666 --> 00:18:04.961
as royal chief architect.

211
00:18:32.572 --> 00:18:33.739
Uh...

212
00:18:34.157 --> 00:18:35.867
Well.

213
00:18:36.701 --> 00:18:37.785
Right.

214
00:18:53.426 --> 00:18:54.510
Shh.

215
00:18:54.594 --> 00:18:56.095
Come on.

216
00:19:05.438 --> 00:19:06.481
Guards.

217
00:19:07.899 --> 00:19:09.775
Prince Moses.

218
00:19:13.196 --> 00:19:14.405
Uh...

219
00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.868
There is a man
tied up in my room.

220
00:19:20.286 --> 00:19:21.746
- Well, look into it.
- Right away, sire.

221
00:19:37.386 --> 00:19:39.222
Please,
I need water.

222
00:19:39.305 --> 00:19:41.015
I have a long journey
ahead of me.

223
00:19:41.224 --> 00:19:43.309
May God protect you.

224
00:19:43.518 --> 00:19:44.852
Thank you.

225
00:20:02.036 --> 00:20:05.414
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I...

226
00:20:06.207 --> 00:20:08.084
Oh, please forgive me. I...

227
00:20:08.417 --> 00:20:12.338
I didn't expect
to see you here,

228
00:20:12.755 --> 00:20:16.092
of all places, at our door.

229
00:20:16.175 --> 00:20:17.343
Mmm.

230
00:20:17.426 --> 00:20:18.594
At last!

231
00:20:18.803 --> 00:20:20.555
- "At last"?
- Didn't I tell you, Aaron?

232
00:20:20.638 --> 00:20:21.639
Didn't I tell you?

233
00:20:21.722 --> 00:20:23.224
I knew he would return to us
when he was ready.

234
00:20:23.307 --> 00:20:24.517
Miriam, do you
want us flogged?

235
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.477
- I knew you cared about our freedom.
- Miriam.

236
00:20:26.561 --> 00:20:28.813
"Freedom"? Why would I
care about that?

237
00:20:29.021 --> 00:20:30.606
Because you're...

238
00:20:30.898 --> 00:20:32.483
You're our brother.

239
00:20:33.025 --> 00:20:34.193
- What?
- They...

240
00:20:38.489 --> 00:20:39.991
They never told you?

241
00:20:40.199 --> 00:20:41.576
Who never told me what?

242
00:20:43.661 --> 00:20:46.080
But you're here.
You must know.

243
00:20:46.163 --> 00:20:47.206
Be careful, slave.

244
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:48.916
Oh, my good Prince.

245
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.418
Um, she's...

246
00:20:50.501 --> 00:20:52.253
She's exhausted
from the day's work.

247
00:20:52.336 --> 00:20:53.838
Uh, not that it was too much.

248
00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:55.339
We... We quite enjoyed it.

249
00:20:55.423 --> 00:20:57.216
But she's confused,

250
00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.968
and knows not
to whom she speaks.

251
00:20:59.051 --> 00:21:01.846
I know to whom I speak, Aaron.

252
00:21:01.929 --> 00:21:03.139
I know who you are.

253
00:21:03.347 --> 00:21:05.641
- And you are not a Prince of Egypt.
- Miriam.

254
00:21:05.933 --> 00:21:06.976
What did you say?

255
00:21:07.059 --> 00:21:08.352
Your Highness,
pay her no heed.

256
00:21:08.686 --> 00:21:10.813
Come, Miriam. May I discuss
something with you?

257
00:21:10.896 --> 00:21:12.023
No, Aaron.

258
00:21:12.231 --> 00:21:14.275
- No. Please, Moses, you must believe.
- That's enough.

259
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.527
- You were born of my mother, Yocheved.
- Stop it.

260
00:21:16.611 --> 00:21:18.195
You are our brother!

261
00:21:18.446 --> 00:21:19.947
Now, you go too far.

262
00:21:20.406 --> 00:21:22.199
- You shall be punished.
- No.

263
00:21:22.283 --> 00:21:24.327
Please, uh, Your Highness.

264
00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:26.662
She's ill. She's very ill.

265
00:21:26.746 --> 00:21:27.747
We beg your forgiveness.

266
00:21:28.164 --> 00:21:29.999
- Please, Miriam, let us go.
- No, Aaron.

267
00:21:30.124 --> 00:21:33.085
Our mother set you adrift in
a basket to save your life!

268
00:21:33.878 --> 00:21:35.463
Save my life? From who?

269
00:21:35.546 --> 00:21:37.632
Ask the man that
you call Father.

270
00:21:39.342 --> 00:21:42.595
- How dare you?
- God saved you to be our deliverer.

271
00:21:42.678 --> 00:21:44.639
- Enough of this.
- And you are, Moses.

272
00:21:45.681 --> 00:21:47.558
- You are the deliverer.
- I said enough!

273
00:21:50.603 --> 00:21:52.730
You will regret this night.

They might have
risen against us.

305
00:27:22.101 --> 00:27:23.936
Father, tell me
you didn't do this.

306
00:27:25.479 --> 00:27:29.483
Moses, sometimes,

307
00:27:29.566 --> 00:27:31.860
for the greater good,

308
00:27:32.277 --> 00:27:34.863
sacrifices must be made.

309
00:27:42.663 --> 00:27:44.623
"Sacrifices"?

310
00:27:48.002 --> 00:27:49.878
Oh, my son.

311
00:27:51.088 --> 00:27:53.382
They were only slaves.

312
00:28:11.817 --> 00:28:12.985
Moses?

313
00:28:14.737 --> 00:28:17.281
Is this where you found me?

314
00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:21.118
Moses, please try
to understand.

315
00:28:24.371 --> 00:28:28.167
So... So everything I thought,

316
00:28:28.876 --> 00:28:32.588
everything I am, is a lie.

317
00:28:32.796 --> 00:28:34.131
No.

318
00:28:34.465 --> 00:28:36.175
You are our son,

319
00:28:37.009 --> 00:28:38.260
and we love you.

320
00:28:40.054 --> 00:28:41.889
Why did you choose me?

321
00:28:43.015 --> 00:28:44.850
We didn't, Moses.

322
00:28:45.601 --> 00:28:47.352

331
00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:43.659
Last night, the gods
granted me a vision.

332
00:29:43.992 --> 00:29:46.245
I'm not merely going to
restore this temple.

333
00:29:46.537 --> 00:29:48.122
I will make it more grand,

334
00:29:48.205 --> 00:29:50.999
more splendid than any other
monument in upper or lower Egypt.

335
00:29:51.083 --> 00:29:52.167
I'll make you...

336
00:30:23.532 --> 00:30:25.701
Moses. Look,

337
00:30:25.784 --> 00:30:28.579
fate has turned our
little misadventure

338
00:30:28.662 --> 00:30:29.705
into a great opportunity.

339
00:30:29.788 --> 00:30:30.873
Get up, old man.

340
00:30:30.956 --> 00:30:33.417
I know Father will be so
pleased with what you and I...

341
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.711
Put your back into it!

342
00:30:36.879 --> 00:30:38.172
Faster!

343
00:30:40.048 --> 00:30:41.925
And this is
just the beginning.

344
00:30:42.634 --> 00:30:46.138
A gateway will open to an entire
new city of white limestone,

345
00:30:46.221 --> 00:30:47.556
more dazzling than the sun.

346
00:30:48.182 --> 00:30:50.434
And here, a statue of Hapi...

347
00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:53.478
- I said, hurry!
- ...god of the Nile flanked by two great columned halls.

348
00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:55.063
- Stop it!
- Miriam, no.

349
00:30:55.147 --> 00:30:56.273
Somebody's got to stop this.

350
00:30:56.356 --> 00:30:57.399
There's nothing
that we can do.

351
00:31:00.068 --> 00:31:02.821
Let's raise
the roof over here...

352
00:31:09.786 --> 00:31:11.872
Stop it. Stop.

353
00:31:12.164 --> 00:31:14.666
Stop it. Leave that man alone!

354
00:31:16.168 --> 00:31:17.211
Moses.

355
00:31:27.804 --> 00:31:30.098
Out of my way.
Out of my way. Move!

356
00:31:32.643 --> 00:31:34.228
Who did this?

357
00:31:34.561 --> 00:31:36.021
Up there.

358
00:31:36.313 --> 00:31:38.106
It's him. Up there.

359
00:31:51.745 --> 00:31:52.871
Moses.

360
00:32:04.174 --> 00:32:06.093
Moses, what's going on?

361
00:32:06.176 --> 00:32:07.177
Moses!

362
00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:16.937
Moses!

363
00:32:19.815 --> 00:32:21.441
- Moses.
- Let me go!

364
00:32:21.525 --> 00:32:23.443
- No, wait.
- You saw what happened.

365
00:32:23.652 --> 00:32:25.737
I just killed a man.

366
00:32:26.071 --> 00:32:28.490
We can take care of that.

367
00:32:28.782 --> 00:32:30.575
I will make it so
it never happened.

368
00:32:30.659 --> 00:32:33.620
Nothing you can say
can change what I've done.

369
00:32:33.954 --> 00:32:35.414
I am Egypt,

370
00:32:35.497 --> 00:32:37.541
the morning
and the evening star.

371
00:32:37.624 --> 00:32:39.960
If I say day is night,
it will be written,

372
00:32:40.043 --> 00:32:42.879
and you will be what
I say you are.

373
00:32:43.255 --> 00:32:45.424
I say you are innocent.

374
00:32:45.716 --> 00:32:47.301
What you say does not matter.

375
00:32:47.592 --> 00:32:49.177
You don't understand.

376
00:32:50.053 --> 00:32:51.596
I can't stay here any longer.

377
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.681
Moses...

378
00:32:52.764 --> 00:32:56.601
No! All I've ever known
to be true is a lie.

379
00:32:59.521 --> 00:33:01.773
I'm not who you think I am.

380
00:33:02.024 --> 00:33:04.067
What are you talking about?

381
00:33:05.027 --> 00:33:08.488
Go ask the man
I once called Father.

382
00:33:11.742 --> 00:33:12.993
Moses?

383
00:33:16.413 --> 00:33:17.622
Please.

384
00:33:24.921 --> 00:33:26.423
Goodbye, brother.

385
00:33:32.429 --> 00:33:33.972
Moses!

386
00:33:35.432 --> 00:33:37.309
Moses!

387
00:34:42.624 --> 00:34:43.750
No.

388
00:35:55.071 --> 00:35:56.656
Hey, wait.

389
00:35:58.408 --> 00:35:59.618
Please.

390
00:36:24.434 --> 00:36:25.644
What are you doing?

391
00:36:25.727 --> 00:36:27.103
Help! Stop!

392
00:36:27.187 --> 00:36:28.980
- Let our sheep drink!
- Go away!

393
00:36:29.064 --> 00:36:32.067
- Leave us alone!
- Get away from me!

394
00:36:32.192 --> 00:36:34.277
- Leave us alone!
- Get away!

395
00:36:34.361 --> 00:36:36.613
- Stop it!
- Stop it!

396
00:36:36.738 --> 00:36:38.782
- We'll do what we want.
- My father's the high priest of Midian...

397
00:36:38.907 --> 00:36:40.617
- Get away!
- ...and you'll be in big trouble.

398
00:36:43.078 --> 00:36:44.788
Hey, you.

399
00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.457
Aren't these your camels?

400
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.919
- Hut-hut.
- No, no.

401
00:36:51.002 --> 00:36:52.045
- No, no, wait!
- No!

402
00:36:52.379 --> 00:36:53.964
- Wait, stop!
- No!

403
00:37:10.647 --> 00:37:12.232
What are
you girls doing?

404
00:37:12.357 --> 00:37:14.859
We're trying to get the funny
man out of the well.

405
00:37:15.026 --> 00:37:17.279
Trying to get the funny man
out of the well.

406
00:37:17.487 --> 00:37:19.406
Well, that's one
I've never heard before.

407
00:37:20.991 --> 00:37:24.202
Oh, my. Oh...
Don't worry down there.

408
00:37:24.369 --> 00:37:26.037
We'll get you out. Hold on.

409
00:37:31.501 --> 00:37:32.544
You.

410
00:37:32.627 --> 00:37:33.628
Huh?

411
00:37:40.552 --> 00:37:41.553
Mmm-hmm.

412
00:37:44.472 --> 00:37:47.934
That's why Papa says
she'll never get married.

413
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:53.898
You don't have to do this.

414
00:37:53.982 --> 00:37:55.233
Ladies, please, I'm really...

415
00:37:55.442 --> 00:37:56.526
I'm really quite...

416
00:37:56.693 --> 00:37:58.486
No, not there, please.

417
00:37:58.570 --> 00:37:59.571
That tickles.

418
00:37:59.654 --> 00:38:01.615
Ladies, you've cleaned
every inch of me.

419
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:03.992
Whoa! I... I was wrong.

420
00:38:04.659 --> 00:38:07.287
Let me through. Let me through.
I want to see him.

421
00:38:07.662 --> 00:38:08.788
Ah!

422
00:38:09.331 --> 00:38:12.000
You are most welcome.

423
00:38:12.125 --> 00:38:14.252
You should not be a stranger
in this land.

424
00:38:14.461 --> 00:38:16.921
You have been sent
as a blessing.

425
00:38:17.213 --> 00:38:18.715
And tonight,

426
00:38:18.798 --> 00:38:21.009
you shall be my honored guest.

427
00:38:22.177 --> 00:38:26.056
My father,
Jethro, High Priest of Midian.

428
00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:36.983
Psst.

429
00:38:37.275 --> 00:38:38.526
Sit with me.

430
00:38:39.986 --> 00:38:41.404
All right.

431
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:45.116
Psst.

432
00:38:45.575 --> 00:38:46.618
Not yet.

433
00:38:46.743 --> 00:38:47.952
Oh, sorry.

434
00:38:48.203 --> 00:38:49.496
My children,

435
00:38:50.205 --> 00:38:53.625
let us give thanks
for this bountiful food.

436
00:38:54.626 --> 00:38:56.419
And let us also give thanks

437
00:38:56.711 --> 00:38:59.422
for the presence
of this brave young man

438
00:38:59.923 --> 00:39:01.466
whom we honor here tonight.

439
00:39:03.551 --> 00:39:05.720
Please, sir,
I wish you wouldn't.

440
00:39:06.012 --> 00:39:08.640
I've done nothing in my life
worth honoring.

441
00:39:13.103 --> 00:39:16.314
First, you rescue
Tzipporah from Egypt,

442
00:39:16.523 --> 00:39:18.400
then you defend
my younger daughters

443
00:39:18.483 --> 00:39:19.526
from brigands.

444
00:39:20.193 --> 00:39:22.195
You think that is nothing?

445
00:39:23.071 --> 00:39:25.657

what is worthy of honor.

It's too early for this.

494
00:44:31.337 --> 00:44:33.589
<i>Moses.</i>

495
00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:37.844
<i>Moses.</i>

496
00:44:39.429 --> 00:44:41.597
<i>Moses.</i>

497
00:44:41.889 --> 00:44:43.433
<i>Moses.</i>

498
00:44:46.519 --> 00:44:48.021
Here I am.

499
00:44:49.981 --> 00:44:52.775
<i>Take the sandals
from your feet,</i>

500
00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:57.488
<i>for the place on which you
stand is holy ground.</i>

501
00:45:05.872 --> 00:45:07.415
Who are you?

502
00:45:09.625 --> 00:45:12.587
<i>I am that I am.</i>

503
00:45:15.506 --> 00:45:17.050
I don't understand.

504
00:45:17.925 --> 00:45:20.428
<i>I am the God
of your ancestors,</i>

505
00:45:20.511 --> 00:45:24.015
<i>Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</i>

506
00:45:27.018 --> 00:45:28.895
<i>You were born
of my mother, Yocheved.</i>

507
00:45:28.978 --> 00:45:30.897
<i>You are our brother.</i>

508
00:45:34.358 --> 00:45:36.611
What do you want with me?

509
00:45:38.196 --> 00:45:42.450
<i>I have seen the oppression
of my people in Egypt</i>

510
00:45:42.658 --> 00:45:45.286
<i>and have heard their cry.</i>

511
00:45:46.204 --> 00:45:48.498
<i>Stop it!
Leave that man alone!</i>

512
00:45:48.956 --> 00:45:50.124
<i>So I have come down</i>

513
00:45:50.208 --> 00:45:51.959
<i>to deliver them
out of slavery,</i>

514
00:45:53.669 --> 00:45:56.756
<i>and bring them to a good land,</i>

515
00:45:57.673 --> 00:46:02.845
<i>a land flowing with milk
and honey.</i>

516
00:46:04.597 --> 00:46:07.225
<i>And so, unto Pharaoh,</i>

517
00:46:07.934 --> 00:46:11.771
<i>I shall send you.</i>

518
00:46:13.106 --> 00:46:16.484
Me? Who am I to
lead these people?

519
00:46:17.026 --> 00:46:19.320
They'll never believe me.
They won't even listen.

520
00:46:19.403 --> 00:46:22.073
<i>I shall teach you
what to say.</i>

521
00:46:22.281 --> 00:46:24.867
<i>Let my people go!</i>

522
00:46:25.785 --> 00:46:27.620
But I was their enemy.

523
00:46:27.995 --> 00:46:29.247
I was the Prince of Egypt,

524
00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:32.291
the son of the man who
slaughtered their children.

525
00:46:32.708 --> 00:46:34.961
You've... You've chosen
the wrong messenger.

526
00:46:35.044 --> 00:46:37.421
How can I even speak
to these people?

527
00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:40.550
<i>Who made man's mouth?</i>

528
00:46:40.633 --> 00:46:44.470
<i>Who made the deaf, the mute,
the seeing or the blind?</i>

529
00:46:44.637 --> 00:46:46.013
<i>Did not I?</i>

530
00:46:46.389 --> 00:46:47.557
<i>Now go!</i>

531
00:47:00.361 --> 00:47:02.488
<i>Oh, Moses,</i>

532
00:47:03.156 --> 00:47:07.118
<i>I shall be with you when
you go to the King of Egypt.</i>

533
00:47:08.661 --> 00:47:11.289
<i>But Pharaoh will not listen.</i>

534
00:47:15.126 --> 00:47:18.254
<i>So I will stretch out my hand,</i>

535
00:47:18.337 --> 00:47:23.718
<i>and smite Egypt
with all my wonders.</i>

536
00:47:27.263 --> 00:47:30.224
<i>Take the staff
in your hand, Moses.</i>

537
00:47:31.851 --> 00:47:38.024
<i>With it, you shall
do my wonders.</i>

538
00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:45.656
<i>I shall be with you, Moses.</i>

539
00:47:46.657 --> 00:47:48.701
<i>Moses.</i>

540
00:47:50.411 --> 00:47:52.747
<i>Moses.</i>

541
00:49:12.493 --> 00:49:13.911
But, Moses,

542
00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:17.081
you are just one man.

543
00:49:21.002 --> 00:49:22.712
Tzipporah.

544
00:49:24.755 --> 00:49:26.465
Please.

545
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:36.225
Look at your family.

546
00:49:39.812 --> 00:49:41.564
They are free.

547
00:49:42.732 --> 00:49:44.442
They have a future.

548
00:49:44.775 --> 00:49:47.320
They have hopes and dreams,

549
00:49:47.611 --> 00:49:50.698
and the promise
of a life with dignity.

550
00:49:53.326 --> 00:49:55.953
That is what I want
for my people.

551
00:49:57.621 --> 00:50:02.168
And that is why I must do the
task that God has given me.

552
00:50:15.473 --> 00:50:17.016
I'm coming with you.

553
00:51:46.313 --> 00:51:47.731
Ramses.

554
00:51:49.275 --> 00:51:50.317
Moses?

555
00:51:50.401 --> 00:51:51.527
Is it really?

556
00:51:57.324 --> 00:51:59.952
- Moses, where have you been?
- Ramses.

557
00:52:00.035 --> 00:52:01.203
I took you for dead.

558
00:52:03.622 --> 00:52:05.374
Look at you.

559
00:52:06.375 --> 00:52:08.711
- Pharaoh.
- Well, look at you.

560
00:52:08.794 --> 00:52:10.629
What on Earth
are you dressed as?

561
00:52:11.797 --> 00:52:13.632
Oh, Ramses,

562
00:52:13.716 --> 00:52:15.384
it's so good to see you.

563
00:52:15.676 --> 00:52:17.386
Excuse me, uh,
Your Majesty.

564
00:52:18.095 --> 00:52:20.097
We are compelled to
remind you that this man

565
00:52:20.181 --> 00:52:22.641
committed a serious crime
against the gods.

566
00:52:22.725 --> 00:52:24.393
We are loathe to
bring it up, mind you.

567
00:52:24.477 --> 00:52:25.936
Yet the law
clearly states

568
00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:27.646
the punishment
for such a crime...

569
00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:29.773
- Death.
- We hesitate to say it.

570
00:52:29.857 --> 00:52:31.150
Be still.

571
00:52:31.734 --> 00:52:33.235
Pharaoh speaks.

572
00:52:34.445 --> 00:52:37.323
I am the morning
and the evening star.

573
00:52:37.406 --> 00:52:38.699
Ramses.

574
00:52:38.782 --> 00:52:41.118
It shall be as I say.

575
00:52:42.161 --> 00:52:46.207
I pardon forever all crimes
of which he stands accused,

576
00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:48.709
and will have it known
that he is

577
00:52:48.792 --> 00:52:50.961
our brother Moses,

578
00:52:51.045 --> 00:52:53.047
the Prince of Egypt.

579
00:52:57.384 --> 00:52:59.011
Ramses.

580
00:53:00.554 --> 00:53:02.806
In my heart,
you are my brother,

581
00:53:03.724 --> 00:53:06.268
but things cannot be
as they were.

582
00:53:06.602 --> 00:53:08.479
I see no reason why not.

583
00:53:10.314 --> 00:53:12.233
You know I am a Hebrew,

584
00:53:12.775 --> 00:53:15.236
and the God of the Hebrews
came to me.

585
00:53:15.736 --> 00:53:16.820
What?

586
00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:21.492
He commands that you
let His people go.

587
00:53:25.538 --> 00:53:26.956
Commands?

588
00:53:32.002 --> 00:53:33.546
Behold,

589
00:53:34.046 --> 00:53:35.756
the power of God.

590
00:53:51.063 --> 00:53:54.608
Well, impressive, but... Mmm.

591
00:53:56.485 --> 00:53:58.404
Very well, Moses.

592
00:53:58.487 --> 00:53:59.947
I'll play along.

593
00:54:00.739 --> 00:54:03.242
Hotep. Huy.

594
00:54:03.325 --> 00:54:07.246

All right, Moses.

655
00:57:26.904 --> 00:57:28.280
I know you.

656
00:57:28.530 --> 00:57:30.491
What's this really about?

657
00:57:32.576 --> 00:57:34.244
Ramses,

658
00:57:34.453 --> 00:57:35.537
look.

659
00:57:36.205 --> 00:57:37.706
What do you see?

660
00:57:41.794 --> 00:57:45.297
A greater Egypt
than that of my father.

661
00:57:45.547 --> 00:57:47.174
That is not what I see.

662
00:57:49.051 --> 00:57:52.262
Moses, I cannot change
what you see.

663
00:57:53.013 --> 00:57:56.517
I have to maintain
the ancient traditions.

664
00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:59.895
I bear the weight
of my father's crown.

665
00:58:00.145 --> 00:58:02.898
Do you still not understand
what Seti was?

666
00:58:03.565 --> 00:58:06.193
He was a great leader.

667
00:58:06.568 --> 00:58:09.863
His hands bore the blood
of thousands of children.

668
00:58:09.947 --> 00:58:11.281
Slaves.

669
00:58:11.615 --> 00:58:13.075
My people.

670
00:58:13.575 --> 00:58:16.078
And I can no longer hide in
the desert while they suffer

671
00:58:17.913 --> 00:58:19.414
at your hands.

672
00:58:23.293 --> 00:58:24.670
So,

673
00:58:25.671 --> 00:58:27.464
you have returned

674
00:58:28.924 --> 00:58:30.425
only to free them.

675
00:58:42.145 --> 00:58:43.564
I'm sorry.

676
00:58:52.656 --> 00:58:54.241
Yes.

677
00:58:55.993 --> 00:58:59.371
I had hoped, but...

678
00:59:13.719 --> 00:59:15.429
I do not know this god.

679
00:59:16.638 --> 00:59:19.182
Neither will I let
your people go.

680
00:59:19.308 --> 00:59:21.018
Ramses, please,
you must listen...

681
00:59:21.101 --> 00:59:23.437
I will not be the weak link.

682
00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:34.323
Tell your people, as of today,

683
00:59:34.573 --> 00:59:37.200
their workload
has been doubled,

684
00:59:37.618 --> 00:59:39.536
thanks to your god.

685
00:59:41.538 --> 00:59:43.373
Or is it thanks

686
00:59:44.249 --> 00:59:45.375
to you?

687
00:59:51.924 --> 00:59:53.508
It's Moses.

688
00:59:55.761 --> 00:59:56.762
Moses.

689
00:59:59.181 --> 01:00:01.725
So, Moses, how does it feel

690
01:00:01.808 --> 01:00:03.894
when you get struck
to the ground?

691
01:00:05.312 --> 01:00:08.315
I didn't mean to
cause you more pain.

692
01:00:08.523 --> 01:00:11.360
I'm just trying to do
as God told me.

693
01:00:11.443 --> 01:00:12.569
God?

694
01:00:12.903 --> 01:00:15.113
When did God start caring
about any of us?

695
01:00:15.572 --> 01:00:19.284
In fact, Moses, when did you
start caring about slaves?

696
01:00:19.743 --> 01:00:21.870
Was it when you found out
that you were one of us?

697
01:00:21.954 --> 01:00:23.705
Don't listen to him.

698
01:00:24.164 --> 01:00:26.416
No, he's... He's right.

699
01:00:27.334 --> 01:00:31.213
I did not see because I
did not wish to see.

700
01:00:31.296 --> 01:00:33.924
Oh, you didn't see because
you didn't wish to see.

701
01:00:34.049 --> 01:00:35.217
Ah.

702
01:00:35.467 --> 01:00:37.886
Well, that makes everything
fine then, doesn't it?

703
01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:40.430
Aaron, you shame yourself.

704
01:00:43.767 --> 01:00:44.935
Miriam.

705
01:00:49.022 --> 01:00:50.857
I'm so sorry.

706
01:01:00.659 --> 01:01:01.868
Moses,

707
01:01:02.661 --> 01:01:04.371
hear what I say.

708
01:01:05.163 --> 01:01:07.207
I have been a slave

709
01:01:07.374 --> 01:01:08.875
all my life,

710
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:13.088
and God has never answered
my prayers until now.

711
01:01:13.922 --> 01:01:15.882
God saved you
from the river,

712
01:01:15.966 --> 01:01:18.677
He saved you in
all your wanderings,

713
01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.012
and even now,

714
01:01:20.095 --> 01:01:22.055
He saves you from
the wrath of Pharaoh.

715
01:01:23.056 --> 01:01:25.183
God will not abandon you.

716
01:01:26.518 --> 01:01:28.478
So don't you abandon us.

717
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:03.930
Miriam, where are you going?

718
01:02:04.556 --> 01:02:05.724
Miriam.

719
01:02:20.322 --> 01:02:22.282
The ball disappears.
Now, where is it?

720
01:02:22.365 --> 01:02:24.201
It's in his hand.
How about that?

721
01:02:26.787 --> 01:02:28.121
Ramses!

722
01:02:29.790 --> 01:02:31.958
Let my people go!

723
01:02:33.794 --> 01:02:36.880
Still gnawing away
at that bone, are we?

724
01:02:37.798 --> 01:02:38.924
Carry on.

725
01:02:39.049 --> 01:02:41.093
You cannot keep ignoring us.

726
01:02:41.593 --> 01:02:45.305
Enough. I will hear no more
of this Hebrew nonsense.

727
01:02:45.388 --> 01:02:46.640
Bring him to me.

728
01:02:49.267 --> 01:02:50.310
- Moses!
- No!

729
01:03:04.825 --> 01:03:08.370
<i>Take the staff
in your hand, Moses.</i>

730
01:03:37.941 --> 01:03:39.025
Father.

731
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:40.652
- It's...
- Blood!

732
01:03:40.986 --> 01:03:43.363
Blood! Blood!

733
01:03:54.374 --> 01:03:55.667
Hotep, Huy.

734
01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:57.252
Explain this to me.

735
01:03:58.503 --> 01:04:00.505
- Ah...
- Rest assured, Your Majesty.

736
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:05.719
Yes, we were going to demonstrate
the superior might of our gods.

737
01:04:05.844 --> 01:04:06.887
Uh...

738
01:04:09.264 --> 01:04:11.683
By the power of Ra.

739
01:04:27.616 --> 01:04:30.619
Abandon this
futile mission, Moses.

740
01:04:31.244 --> 01:04:33.580
I've indulged you long enough.

741
01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.917
This must now be finished.

742
01:04:39.753 --> 01:04:41.421
No, Ramses.

743
01:04:41.838 --> 01:04:43.757
It is only beginning.

744
01:04:44.382 --> 01:04:45.425
But, Moses,

745
01:04:45.508 --> 01:04:47.510
didn't you see
what happened?

746
01:04:47.636 --> 01:04:50.013
The priests did
the same thing.

747
01:04:50.305 --> 01:04:53.183
Pharaoh still has the power
over our lives.

748
01:04:56.186 --> 01:04:57.520
Yes, Aaron, it's true.

749
01:04:57.604 --> 01:04:59.397
Pharaoh has the power.

750
01:05:01.566 --> 01:05:03.068
He can take away your food,

751
01:05:03.151 --> 01:05:05.820
your home, your freedom.

752
01:05:06.363 --> 01:05:09.991
He can take away your sons
and daughters.

753
01:05:11.117 --> 01:05:12.869
With one word,

754
01:05:13.703 --> 01:05:16.581
Pharaoh can take away
your very lives.

755
01:05:18.708 --> 01:05:22.045
But there is one thing
he cannot take away from you.

756
01:05:22.712 --> 01:05:24.130
Your faith.

757
01:05:27.050 --> 01:05:28.385
Believe,

758
01:05:28.885 --> 01:05:31.638
for we will see God's wonders.

Ramses?

814
01:09:03.808 --> 01:09:05.935
Oh. Let me guess.

815
01:09:07.479 --> 01:09:12.942
You want me to
let your people go.

816
01:09:15.904 --> 01:09:18.281
I hoped I would find you here.

817
01:09:18.490 --> 01:09:19.491
Get out.

818
01:09:22.494 --> 01:09:26.789
Ramses, we must
bring this to an end.

819
01:09:32.253 --> 01:09:35.089
Ramses, please, talk to me.

820
01:09:35.882 --> 01:09:38.259
We could always talk here.

821
01:09:48.019 --> 01:09:49.479
This place.

822
01:09:51.272 --> 01:09:53.608
So many memories.

823
01:09:56.736 --> 01:09:58.905
I remember the time you

824
01:09:59.489 --> 01:10:03.159
switched the heads of the gods
of the Temple of Ra.

825
01:10:05.245 --> 01:10:06.621
Ah.

826
01:10:07.121 --> 01:10:08.957
If I
recall correctly,

827
01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:13.253
you were there switching heads
right along with me.

828
01:10:14.462 --> 01:10:15.588
No, it was you.

829
01:10:15.672 --> 01:10:16.798
I didn't do that.

830
01:10:17.006 --> 01:10:18.007
Oh, yes, you did.

831
01:10:18.091 --> 01:10:21.511
You put the hippo on the
crocodile, and the crocodile...

832
01:10:21.594 --> 01:10:23.346
- On the falcon.
- Yes.

833
01:10:23.429 --> 01:10:25.265
And the priest thought
it was a horrible omen,

834
01:10:25.348 --> 01:10:26.849
and fasted for two months.

835
01:10:26.975 --> 01:10:28.142
Father was furious.

836
01:10:28.226 --> 01:10:30.436
You were always getting me
into trouble.

837
01:10:37.527 --> 01:10:39.028
But then...

838
01:10:41.447 --> 01:10:43.700
You were always there to

839
01:10:44.867 --> 01:10:47.829
get me out of trouble again.

840
01:10:54.627 --> 01:10:58.089
Why can't things be
the way they were before?

841
01:10:59.632 --> 01:11:00.800
Father.

842
01:11:02.302 --> 01:11:03.344
It's so dark.

843
01:11:05.471 --> 01:11:07.265
I'm frightened.

844
01:11:08.516 --> 01:11:09.934
Why is he here?

845
01:11:13.563 --> 01:11:15.857
Isn't that the man
who did all this?

846
01:11:18.651 --> 01:11:19.861
Yes.

847
01:11:20.903 --> 01:11:23.489
But one must wonder

848
01:11:24.115 --> 01:11:25.533
why?

849
01:11:26.367 --> 01:11:30.330
Because no kingdom should be
made on the backs of slaves.

850
01:11:31.122 --> 01:11:33.166
Ramses, your stubbornness

851
01:11:33.249 --> 01:11:35.168
is bringing this misery
upon Egypt.

852
01:11:35.251 --> 01:11:38.755
It would cease if only you
would let the Hebrews go.

853
01:11:38.921 --> 01:11:41.341
I will not be dictated to.
I will not be threatened.

854
01:11:41.424 --> 01:11:44.093
I am the morning
and the evening star.

855
01:11:44.177 --> 01:11:45.720
I am Pharaoh.

856
01:11:45.845 --> 01:11:47.138
Something else is coming.

857
01:11:47.221 --> 01:11:49.474
Something much worse
than anything before.

858
01:11:49.807 --> 01:11:52.894
Please, let go
of your contempt for life

859
01:11:52.977 --> 01:11:55.188
before it destroys everything
you hold dear.

860
01:11:55.355 --> 01:11:57.231
Think of your son.

861
01:11:58.274 --> 01:11:59.859
I do.

862
01:12:00.026 --> 01:12:02.362
You Hebrews have been
nothing but trouble.

863
01:12:03.029 --> 01:12:04.656
My father had the right idea

864
01:12:04.739 --> 01:12:07.075
about how to deal
with your people.

865
01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.619
- Ramses...
- And I think it's time

866
01:12:09.702 --> 01:12:11.829
- I finished the job.
- Ramses.

867
01:12:11.913 --> 01:12:15.249
And there shall be
a great cry in all of Egypt,

868
01:12:15.333 --> 01:12:18.920
such as never has been
or ever will be again.

869
01:12:33.351 --> 01:12:36.145
Ramses, you bring this
upon yourself.

870
01:12:46.572 --> 01:12:48.449
<i>God has come to me again,</i>

871
01:12:48.533 --> 01:12:51.160
