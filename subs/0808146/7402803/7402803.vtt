| mean, people are dying.

179
00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:00.457
| told you,
I'm not ready yet.

180
00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.625
| am so ready.

181
00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:04.753
Can't | be ready enough
for the both of us?

182
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.088
It doesn't work that way.

183
00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:08.923
It should.

184
00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:10.800
I'm sorry, Erik.

185
00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:12.218
| know how patient
you've been.

186
00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.220
| know. It's just sometimes...

187
00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:15.805
What?

188
00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:20.435
Well, you're a girl. It's a lot
easier for you to be a virgin

189
00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:21.728
because the longer
you stay a virgin,

190
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:23.229
the more pure
and innocent you seem.

191
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:24.898
The longer | stay a virgin,

192
00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:27.692
the more | become the
laughingstock of the entire school.

193
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.113
I'm sorry, but... | mean...

194
00:09:32.197 --> 00:09:33.823
I'm sorry | brought it up.

195
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.658
(BELL RINGING)

196
00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:37.827
Look, | gotta go.
I'll see you after school.

197
00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:41.331
Okay.

198
00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:44.751
Bye.

199
00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:53.843
I'm telling you,
his dick was this big.

200
00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:55.053
(ALL LAUGHING)

201
00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:57.806
NATALIE: What about Erik?
| bet he's got a big one.

202
00:09:58.014 --> 00:09:59.641
Well, Tracy wouldn't know.

203
00:09:59.724 --> 00:10:00.725
Whatever.

204
00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:04.896
Yeah, | guess it's pretty hard to
figure out dick size from dry humping.

205
00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:06.356
Brooke, that's mean.

206
00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:09.609
Just because | don't have a catalog
of the school's dick sizes like you,

207
00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:11.611
doesn't mean
| don't know a thing or two.

208
00:10:11.694 --> 00:10:14.405
Okay, so how big is Erik's?

209
00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:19.369
See? Told you.
Come on, Brooke.

210
00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:22.330
It's not like that with us.
| mean, Erik's different.

211
00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:23.790
He respects my boundaries.

212
00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:25.959
Well, you better give that boy
a reason to stick around,

213
00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:28.419
or he's gonna find a girl
with looser boundaries.

214
00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:30.213
Erik would never do that.

215
00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:31.548
Yeah, that's what
you said about Trent.

216
00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:35.426
He broke up with you over sex,
and that was sophomore year.

217
00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.721
Yeah, this justisn't gonna
work without the sex.

218
00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:41.015
God, Trent is cute,

219
00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:43.518
and | heard he just
broke up with Holly.

220
00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:48.106
Look, Tracy, we love you, and
we love Erik, but let's get real.

221
00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:51.234
He's a guy,
and guys have certain needs.

222
00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:55.155
They really do. It's like a
caveman thing or something.

223
00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:58.741
Yeah, | can't believe you've
kept him tied up this long.

224
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:01.828
Hey, Erik, guess who
| just talked to?

225
00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:02.996
Who?

226
00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:05.165
Your cousin Stifler
up at Michigan.

227
00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:06.624
Why are you talking
to my cousin Dwight?

228
00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:08.293
Oh, we talk all the time.

229
00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.503
What? We have
a lot in common.

230
00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:12.172
What's that crazy
bastard up to?

231
00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:16.009
He's in some fraternity, and all
those guys do is drink and fuck.

232
00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:18.845
And it just so happens that they're
throwing a monster party this weekend

233
00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:20.013
for the Naked Mile.

234
00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:21.222
What's the Naked Mile?

235
00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:23.099
Oh, dude, it's this thing
where thousands of students

236
00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:24.559
run naked through campus.

237
00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:26.853
It's their way of blowing off
steam after exams.

238
00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:28.730
Thousands of naked chicks?

239
00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:31.399
Stifler says that this party
is gonna be epic.

240
00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:34.068
Bottom line is,
this place is played out.

241
00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:35.486
High school's over for us.

242
00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:37.572
It's time to plant
our flag in a new land.

243
00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:41.326
Porn, cumshot, dead
grandmother, grounded forever?

244
00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:42.660
Don't worry.

245
00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:45.788
Just tell your parents that, you're
thinking about going to school there.

246
00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:46.873
| don't know, man.

247
00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:47.957
Oh, please.

248
00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:49.584
Your mom cried
when you told her

249
00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:51.002
you were going
to school in Boston.

250
00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:52.086
She'll probably help you pack

251
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.504
if she thinks it'll keep you
close to home.

252
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.631
I'll help you pack.

253
00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:56.633
I'll make sandwiches.

254
00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:57.842
Chicken salad?

255
00:11:57.967 --> 00:11:59.010
Of course.

256
00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.095
Are you gonna get a chance
to see your cousin?

257
00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:04.057
Yeah. We might stop by
and say hello.

258
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.893
Now, there's someone you
should definitely look up to.

259
00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:09.270
| bet he doesn't have time
to blow his load on his family.

260
00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:11.314
Harry, please. MR. STIFLER:
| don't understand.

261
00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:13.900
When | was your age, | was
up to my neck in poontang.

262
00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:16.694
| didn't have time
to spank my monkey.

263
00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:20.406
Thank you for that very
disturbing image, Dad.

264
00:12:20.698 --> 00:12:24.452
| mean, Stiflers do not fake being
sick to stay home and pull dick.

265
00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:25.787
We cut class to get ass.

266
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.331
Yes, | know. That saying
is on our family crest.

267
00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:30.124
Oh, don't let me forget
to pack the Imodium AD.

268
00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:31.626
Just in case you get diarrhea.

269
00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:33.628
Mom.
| am so excited.

270
00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:34.754
Aren't you excited, Harry?

271
00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:36.798
I'm very excited. (LAUGHS)

272
00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:39.175
Don't you get excited.

273
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.635
ERIK ON PHONE: /t worked
Jjust like you said.

274
00:12:40.718 --> 00:12:41.719
She's helping me pack,

275
00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:43.596
and she's even
making us sandwiches.

276
00:12:43.805 --> 00:12:44.973
Chicken salad?

277
00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:46.432
Oh, sweet.
Yup.

278
00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:48.309
See, | told you.
Never doubt me.

279
00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:50.186
Man, this weekend
is gonna be tits.

280
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.646
| can't wait to see Stifler.

281
00:12:52.814 --> 00:12:54.983
Hey, how come
you never call me Stifler?

282
00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.235
You're more of an Erik.

283
00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:58.778
(BEEPING)

284
00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:00.154
Hold on.

285
00:13:00.863 --> 00:13:02.323
That's Tracy.
I'd better take it.

286
00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:03.574
All right, later.

287
00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:08.871
Hey, sweetie. Listen,
about today, I'm really...

288
00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:11.165
Erik, | wanna have sex.

289
00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:13.084
Excuse me?

290
00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:15.837
| wanna have sex.

291
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.046
Are you serious?

292
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:18.256
Absolutely.

293
00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:20.591
Do you have me
on a conference call?

294
00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:22.135
Because if you do,
that is so not cool.

295
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.928
Erik, this isn't a joke.

296
00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:26.764
| want to have sex.

297
00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:30.935
Yes! Yes, yes.

298
00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:32.562
Tonight.

299
00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:33.771
What?

300
00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:36.024
Tonight. | wanna
have sex tonight.

301
00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:38.318
How am | supposed
to get out of my house?

302
00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:39.861
That's up to you.

303
00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:43.656
But at midnight,
I'll be in my basement,

304
00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:45.658
waiting to be ravished.

305
00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:47.327
I'll be there.

306
00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:10.683
Hypocrite.

307
00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:15.521
So you get the beer and the
weed, and I'll handle the nitrous.

308
00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:17.482
You got it.
What's Erik bringing?

309
00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:18.733
Sandwiches.

310
00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:22.445
Nice. Chicken salad
and college pussy.

311
00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:24.155
My favorite combination.

312
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.032
Yeah, well, at least you'll
get to taste the chicken salad.

313
00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:27.283
Ow.

314
00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.202
Hey, what do you think Erik's
doing right now?

315
00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:31.496
Probably beating off
to dumpster porn.

316
00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:35.750
No more beating off to dumpster
porn. No more virgin jokes.

317
00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:38.169
Tonight, Erik Stifler
becomes a man.

318
00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:58.731
(KNOCKING ON WINDOW)

319
00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:16.707
Hi.

320
00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:26.551
All right, listen.
No.

321
00:15:27.385 --> 00:15:28.845
No talking.

322
00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:35.351
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

323
00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:56.247
Wait.

324
00:15:56.372 --> 00:15:57.415
What?

325
00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.916
Did you hear something?

326
00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:02.712
No. Don't worry,
my parents are passed out.

327
00:16:05.047 --> 00:16:07.925
Are you sure?
You know how my stomach gets.

328
00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:11.304
Here, I'll help you relax.

329
00:16:25.943 --> 00:16:28.154
You brought something, right?

330
00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:32.492
Oh, shit. I left it at home.

331
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.204
| can run back and get it.
I'll be back in like five...

332
00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:38.831
No, no, don't worry.
I've got one.

333
00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:45.087
Do you wanna put it on
or should 1?

334
00:16:45.296 --> 00:16:47.089
Let's put it on together.

335
00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:48.508
Okay.

336
00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:06.317
Are you ready?

337
00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:08.194
Yeah.

338
00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:09.612
(DOOR OPENING)

339
00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:13.407
Shit. Someone's coming.
Quick, get behind the bar. Now!

340
00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:27.463
Honey, what are you
still doing up?

341
00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:29.674
Yoga.

342
00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:31.425
TRACY'S DAD:
| ate too much at dinner.

343
00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:32.969
Why don't you take
an Alka-Seltzer?

344
00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:34.804
Alka-Seltzer is for babies.

345
00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:36.347
| just need a nightcap.

346
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:37.557
(FARTING)

347
00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:41.018
Excuse me.

348
00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:43.312
Sounds like you could use
an Alka-Seltzer.

349
00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:45.523
Oh, Daddy. Here, let me
get you your drink.

350
00:17:45.606 --> 00:17:47.733
No, that's okay, honey.
You go back to your yoga.

351
00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:49.443

00:52:10.836 --> 00:52:12.212
What's up?

876
00:52:17.343 --> 00:52:18.510
Bitch.

877
00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:22.306
BRANDY: (LAUGHING)
That did not happen.

878
00:52:22.389 --> 00:52:25.643
| swear to God, | was running through
the streets with nylons on my head

879
00:52:25.726 --> 00:52:27.728
and the condom still on.

880
00:52:28.062 --> 00:52:29.730
| can't believe | just
told you that story.

881
00:52:29.855 --> 00:52:31.231
| think it's great.

882
00:52:31.315 --> 00:52:34.902
| mean, think of it this way,
you'll never forget your first time.

883
00:52:35.027 --> 00:52:36.654
Well, it wasn't...

884
00:52:36.904 --> 00:52:38.072
Technically...

885
00:52:38.155 --> 00:52:39.657
Oh, no, wait.

886
00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:42.076
You mean you didn't even
get to... He came down too fast.

887
00:52:42.201 --> 00:52:43.327
Oh! (LAUGHING)

888
00:52:43.827 --> 00:52:47.081
Thank you. Thank you for
laughing at my misfortune.

889
00:52:48.082 --> 00:52:51.877
| think you're a sweetheart.
And you're really cute.

890
00:52:53.045 --> 00:52:54.421
This is me.

891
00:52:55.923 --> 00:52:57.800
So, are you guys
running the Mile tomorrow?

892
00:52:57.925 --> 00:53:01.428
| don't know. There's something
about running naked down the street

893
00:53:01.553 --> 00:53:03.472
while you're still a virgin...

894
00:53:03.597 --> 00:53:05.015
Didn't stop you before.

895
00:53:05.099 --> 00:53:06.600
Touche.

896
00:53:06.934 --> 00:53:09.603
You never know,
that virgin thing,

897
00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:13.440
it could totally change
by the end of the weekend.

898
00:53:15.943 --> 00:53:17.611
Thanks for walking me home.

899
00:53:38.924 --> 00:53:39.925
(GROANS)

900
00:53:40.008 --> 00:53:42.845
What the hell happened
to you last night?

901
00:53:44.012 --> 00:53:45.180
What's up, fellas?

902
00:53:45.305 --> 00:53:46.473
What's up?

903
00:53:46.598 --> 00:53:48.642
What's up is
we got cock-blocked

904
00:53:48.726 --> 00:53:50.144
by some midgets at the bar.

905
00:53:50.269 --> 00:53:53.313
Cooze, never mind that.
Where the hell were you?

906
00:53:53.605 --> 00:53:58.152
Well, Mother, if you must
know, | was with a girl.

907
00:53:59.069 --> 00:54:00.070
Ooh.

908
00:54:00.779 --> 00:54:01.780
Mmm.

909
00:54:01.864 --> 00:54:03.574
Bullshit. What girl?

910
00:54:03.657 --> 00:54:06.243
Her name is Brandy. She's
in a sorority and she's hot,

911
00:54:06.326 --> 00:54:08.787
and I'm supposed to meet her
at the Mile tonight.

912
00:54:09.496 --> 00:54:11.290
Dude, | don't get it.

913
00:54:11.457 --> 00:54:15.711
We come to college, we get
blown off by chicks for midgets,

914
00:54:15.836 --> 00:54:18.672
and you're hanging out with
a sorority girl?

915
00:54:18.797 --> 00:54:21.175
What the fuck
is going on here?

916
00:54:21.550 --> 00:54:23.969
So, what are you gonna do?

917
00:54:24.887 --> 00:54:27.848
What do you mean?
He's gonna bang that chick.

918
00:54:29.516 --> 00:54:30.809
Aren't you?

919
00:54:30.893 --> 00:54:32.186
What?

920
00:54:34.688 --> 00:54:35.814
Yeah.

921
00:54:36.023 --> 00:54:39.735
Yeah, of course | will. I'm on a
guilt-free pass, why wouldn't 1?

922
00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:41.820
Why the hesitation, man?

923
00:54:41.904 --> 00:54:42.905
(GROANS)

924
00:54:42.988 --> 00:54:45.866
Oh, shit! You're not
gonna do it. | said I'll do it.

925
00:54:45.991 --> 00:54:49.703
Erik, you've been given a gift
from above. Don't fuck it up.

926
00:54:49.828 --> 00:54:50.913
| won't.

927
00:54:51.038 --> 00:54:52.122
Yes, you will.

928
00:54:52.206 --> 00:54:53.248
No.

929
00:54:53.999 --> 00:54:56.210
L... | gotta get out of here.

930
00:55:16.522 --> 00:55:18.690
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello?

931
00:55:18.774 --> 00:55:20.400
ERIK: Hey, it's me.

932
00:55:22.444 --> 00:55:24.279
Calling to see
how you're doing.

933
00:55:24.404 --> 00:55:25.614
I'm fine,

934
00:55:25.739 --> 00:55:27.866
I'm just studying.
Oh. Okay.

935
00:55:29.576 --> 00:55:30.577
Cool.

936
00:55:30.702 --> 00:55:33.956
So, did you guys decide if you're
gonna run in the Naked Mile?

937
00:55:34.706 --> 00:55:38.210
No, not yet. But you know me,
I'll probably just wimp out.

938
00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:40.087
| mean, you don't have to.

939
00:55:40.879 --> 00:55:42.214
Yeah, | know.

940
00:55:42.923 --> 00:55:45.384
Are you okay? | mean,
you sound a little weird.

941
00:55:45.926 --> 00:55:47.219
I'm fine.

942
00:55:48.262 --> 00:55:50.764
I'm fine. | just wanted
to call and say hello.

943
00:55:50.889 --> 00:55:55.519
Thanks, but you don't need to
check in. | mean, go, have fun.

944
00:55:55.602 --> 00:55:57.980
That's what this weekend's
all about.

945
00:55:59.398 --> 00:56:00.607
You're the greatest.

946
00:56:12.661 --> 00:56:14.121
Erik Stifler.

947
00:56:17.624 --> 00:56:20.043
Hey, Mr. Levenstein.
Hello, Erik, good to see you.

948
00:56:20.127 --> 00:56:23.755
Yeah. Wow, | haven't seen you since
my parents' New Year's party, right?

949
00:56:23.839 --> 00:56:27.634
Yes, well, your folks really, really
know how to ring in the new year.

950
00:56:27.759 --> 00:56:31.597
Look, I'm sorry about my dad giving
you that wedgie in front of everybody.

951
00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:34.975
Well, your dad's been doing
that to me since we were kids,

952
00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:37.519
and strangely enough,
| enjoy it.

953
00:56:40.814 --> 00:56:43.150
So, what are you
doing up here?

954
00:56:44.318 --> 00:56:46.945
Oh, well,
| went to school here

955
00:56:47.029 --> 00:56:50.824
and, you know, | like to come
back every now and then

956
00:56:51.325 --> 00:56:52.743
and check out the campus.

957
00:56:52.826 --> 00:56:57.039
That's the only reason I'm here.
No other reason that | can think of.

958
00:56:57.164 --> 00:56:59.958
And what about you?
What are you doing here?

959
00:57:00.459 --> 00:57:02.502
Actually,
it's kind of personal.

960
00:57:02.628 --> 00:57:04.922
Oh. Well, say no more.
Okay.

961
00:57:05.005 --> 00:57:06.173
Okay, listen,
good seeing you.

962
00:57:06.298 --> 00:57:08.008
Yeah, for sure.

963
00:57:13.847 --> 00:57:16.058
Actually, Mr. Levenstein,
you were a counselor

964
00:57:16.183 --> 00:57:18.352
at Tall Oaks Band Camp
with my cousin Matt, right?

965
00:57:18.477 --> 00:57:21.897
Yes. Yes, | was. And your cousin
Matt needed some counseling...

966
00:57:22.022 --> 00:57:25.776
Yeah. | might add. |
gave him some advice.

967
00:57:25.859 --> 00:57:28.862
Advice. (CLEARS THROAT)
Do you think | could

968
00:57:31.365 --> 00:57:33.367
confide something in you?

969
00:57:33.659 --> 00:57:36.453
Well, sure. Yes, Erik,
anything. Anything.

970
00:57:36.536 --> 00:57:37.704
Okay.

971
00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:39.623
I'm a virgin.

972
00:57:39.706 --> 00:57:41.041
Okay, can | stop you there?

973
00:57:41.166 --> 00:57:44.336
You're a Stifler and a virgin?

974
00:57:45.879 --> 00:57:47.005
Yeah.

975
00:57:48.924 --> 00:57:52.386
Well, so you're a virgin.
What's the big deal?

976
00:57:53.178 --> 00:57:57.724
Well, the other night, my girlfriend
and I... We tried to, you know...

977
00:57:59.851 --> 00:58:01.228
Right. But her father

978
00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:03.313
came down before
we had the chance to.

979
00:58:03.397 --> 00:58:05.732
So she changed her mind
completely about the sex,

980
00:58:05.857 --> 00:58:08.902
but she gave me a guilt-free
pass for the weekend.

981
00:58:09.027 --> 00:58:11.363
You got the guilt-free pass?

982
00:58:12.948 --> 00:58:14.574
What do you mean?

983
00:58:14.866 --> 00:58:19.788
Well, | mean, you've got the
old guilt-free pass dilemma.

984
00:58:20.038 --> 00:58:21.665
Yeah.
It's a tough one.

985
00:58:21.748 --> 00:58:23.959
| didn't think people your age
knew about that kind of stuff.

986
00:58:24.084 --> 00:58:27.129
| believe | know more
about this than you think.

987
00:58:28.755 --> 00:58:31.508
Good, because | just
don't know what to do here.

988
00:58:31.591 --> 00:58:35.262
| mean, I've got this smoking-hot
sorority girl all over me.

989
00:58:36.388 --> 00:58:39.516
Well, you know, my son Jim

990
00:58:39.599 --> 00:58:41.810
went through kind of
a similar dilemma.

991
00:58:41.935 --> 00:58:43.770
He was going out
with this very attractive

992
00:58:43.895 --> 00:58:45.814
foreign-exchange student
named Nadia.

993
00:58:45.939 --> 00:58:49.317
Right, right, yeah. That's the one
he blew his load too early with, right?

994
00:58:49.443 --> 00:58:50.527
Yes.
Twice.

995
00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:51.945
Yes.
Over the Internet.

996
00:58:52.070 --> 00:58:53.697
That's the one.
Yeah.

997
00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:57.117
Well, blowing loads aside...

998
00:58:57.242 --> 00:58:58.285
Yeah.

999
00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:00.704
The next summer Nadia came
to visit Jim at the beach,

1000
00:59:00.787 --> 00:59:02.247
and he turned her down

1001
00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:05.751
because he had fallen in love
with Michelle,

1002
00:59:06.585 --> 00:59:10.589
who he later married, and is
now the mother of my grandchild.

1003
00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:15.635
So you're saying | shouldn't
hook up with this sorority girl?

1004
00:59:15.969 --> 00:59:19.139
I'm saying | think only you
know the answer to that, Erik.

1005
00:59:21.767 --> 00:59:23.310
Well, gotta run.

1006
00:59:26.354 --> 00:59:30.025
Oh, Erik, | was sorry to hear
about your grandmother.

1007
00:59:49.169 --> 00:59:51.046
Last night was amazing.

1008
00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:53.632
Yeah, it was.

1009
00:59:53.715 --> 00:59:56.676
The three of us should
do it again sometime.

1010
00:59:57.010 --> 00:59:58.386
Definitely.

1011
01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.057
Definitely.

1012
01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:12.984
Hey, buddy. You know
how to get to Murray Street?

1013
01:00:13.068 --> 01:00:15.529
Oh, yeah, man. Just go
right down Maryland Avenue...

1014
01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:18.657
What the...

1015
01:00:20.575 --> 01:00:22.035
What is this?
Enter the Midget?

1016
01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.830
It's little people, asshole.

1017
01:00:26.414 --> 01:00:28.166
Come get some.

1018
01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:31.503
Come get some, baby!

1019
01:00:32.003 --> 01:00:33.380
(SCREAMING)

1020
01:00:39.845 --> 01:00:41.596
(PANTING)

1021
01:00:41.763 --> 01:00:43.640
Midgets jumped Stifler.

1022
01:00:43.723 --> 01:00:45.016
ALL: What?

1023
01:00:46.017 --> 01:00:48.186
The midgets jumped Stifler.

1024
01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:50.397
He's in
the hospital right now.

1025
01:00:55.277 --> 01:00:56.611
Oh, shit.

1026
01:00:56.736 --> 01:00:58.446
Holy shit.

1027
01:00:59.447 --> 01:01:01.366
Man, he is fucked up.

1028
01:01:02.284 --> 01:01:03.743
First Grandma,
and now this.

1029
01:01:03.869 --> 01:01:05.203
All right, we gotta get
those fucking midgets.

1030
01:01:05.287 --> 01:01:06.371
Yeah, man.

1031
01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:09.958
Jesus, Ryan, keep it down, will
you? | got a huge fucking headache.

1032
01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:12.210
We thought
this guy was you.

1033
01:01:13.253 --> 01:01:14.546
Fuck, no.

1034
01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:16.715
| don't know
what happened to that pussy.

1035
01:01:17.632 --> 01:01:19.593
Hey, man,
what the hell happened?

1036
01:01:19.718 --> 01:01:23.430
Rock and his boys jumped me,
wearing all black and ski masks.

1037
01:01:23.555 --> 01:01:24.931
Like | wouldn't know
it was them.

1038
01:01:25.056 --> 01:01:28.310
Are you all right? Are you
gonna be able to run in the Mile?

1039
01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:29.728
Doesn't look like it.

1040
01:01:30.312 --> 01:01:33.815
Doc says the Stif-man's gonna be
laid up for at least a couple of more days.

1041
01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:36.151
Hey, don't worry. We
will find those little fuckers.

1042
01:01:36.276 --> 01:01:41.114
No. | appreciate it, okay?
Stifler'll think of something.

1043
01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:45.285
Now you guys are up here
to do two things. Have fun,

1044
01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:47.412
