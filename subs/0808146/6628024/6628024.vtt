Well, you're a girl.
It's a lot easier for you to be a virgin

because the longer you stay a virgin,
the more pure and innocent you seem.

The longer I stay a virgin,

157
00:09:25.257 --> 00:09:28.839

Okay, so how big is Erik's?

173
00:10:17.596 --> 00:10:18.675
See? Told you.

174
00:10:18.764 --> 00:10:20.139
Come on, Brooke.

175
00:10:20.223 --> 00:10:21.717
It's not like that with us.

176
00:10:21.808 --> 00:10:24.096
I mean, Erik's different.
He respects my boundaries.

177
00:10:24.185 --> 00:10:26.224
Well, you better give that boy
a reason to stick around,

178
00:10:26.312 --> 00:10:28.933
or he's gonna find a girl
with looser boundaries.

179
00:10:29.356 --> 00:10:30.519
Erik would never do that.

180
00:10:30.608 --> 00:10:32.232
Yeah, that's what you said about Trent.

181
00:10:32.317 --> 00:10:35.816
He broke up with you over sex,
and that was sophomore year.

182
00:10:35.904 --> 00:10:38.905
Yeah, this just isn't gonna
work without the sex.

183
00:10:39.574 --> 00:10:43.488
God, Trent is cute,
and I heard he just broke up with Holly.

184
00:10:44.412 --> 00:10:48.539
Look, Tracy, we love you, and we love Erik,
but let's get real.

185
00:10:48.999 --> 00:10:51.490
He's a guy, and guys have certain needs.

186
00:10:51.585 --> 00:10:55.416
They really do.
It's like a caveman thing or something.

187
00:10:55.505 --> 00:10:59.039
Yeah, I can't believe
you've kept him tied up this long.

188
00:10:59.967 --> 00:11:02.126
Hey, Erik, guess who I just talked to?

189
00:11:02.219 --> 00:11:03.298
Who?

190
00:11:03.387 --> 00:11:05.426
Your cousin Stifler up at Michigan.

191
00:11:05.514 --> 00:11:06.925
Why are you talking to my cousin Dwight?

192
00:11:07.015 --> 00:11:09.091
Oh, we talk all the time.

193
00:11:09.184 --> 00:11:10.559
What? We have a lot in common.

194
00:11:10.644 --> 00:11:12.470
What's that crazy bastard up to?

195
00:11:12.562 --> 00:11:16.310
He's in some fraternity,
and all those guys do is drink and fuck.

196
00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:19.150
And it just so happens that they're throwing
a monster party this weekend

197
00:11:19.235 --> 00:11:20.314
for the Naked Mile.

198
00:11:20.402 --> 00:11:21.517
What's the Naked Mile?

199
00:11:21.612 --> 00:11:23.403
Oh, dude, it's this thing
where thousands of students

200
00:11:23.489 --> 00:11:24.864
run naked through campus.

201
00:11:24.948 --> 00:11:27.154
It's the way of blowing off
steam after exams.

202
00:11:27.242 --> 00:11:29.033
Thousands of naked chicks?

203
00:11:29.119 --> 00:11:32.119
Stifler says that this party is gonna be epic.

204
00:11:32.205 --> 00:11:34.363
Bottom line is, this place is played out.

205
00:11:34.457 --> 00:11:35.785
High school's over for us.

206
00:11:35.875 --> 00:11:37.832
It's time to plant our flag in a new land.

207
00:11:38.252 --> 00:11:41.786
Porn, cumshot, dead grandmother,
grounded forever?

208
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.959
Don't worry.

209
00:11:43.048 --> 00:11:46.333
Just tell your parents that, you know,
you're thinking about going to school there.

210
00:11:46.426 --> 00:11:48.335
- I don't know, man.
- Oh, please.

211
00:11:48.428 --> 00:11:51.049
Your mom cried when you told her
you were going to school in Boston.

212
00:11:51.138 --> 00:11:53.843
She'll probably help you pack
if she thinks it'll keep you close to home.

213
00:11:53.933 --> 00:11:55.177
I'll help you pack.

214
00:11:55.684 --> 00:11:56.929
I'll make sandwiches.

215
00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.140
Chicken salad?

216
00:11:58.228 --> 00:11:59.307
Of course.

217
00:11:59.396 --> 00:12:01.388
Are you gonna get a chance
to see your cousin?

218
00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:04.351
Yeah. We might stop by and say hello.

219
00:12:04.442 --> 00:12:07.312
Now, there's someone you
should definitely look up to.

220
00:12:07.403 --> 00:12:09.775
I bet he doesn't have time
to blow his load on his family.

221
00:12:09.864 --> 00:12:11.607
- Harry, please.
- HARRY: I don't understand.

222
00:12:11.699 --> 00:12:14.901
When I was your age,
I was up to my neck in poontang.

223
00:12:15.243 --> 00:12:17.450
I didn't have time to spank my monkey.

224
00:12:17.537 --> 00:12:20.906
Thank you for that very
disturbing image, Dad.

225
00:12:20.999 --> 00:12:24.866
I mean, Stiflers do not fake
being sick to stay home and pull dick.

226
00:12:24.961 --> 00:12:26.075
We cut class to get ass.

227
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.542
Yes, I know.
That saying is on our family crest.

228
00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:30.504
Oh, don't let me forget
to pack the Imodium AD.

229
00:12:30.591 --> 00:12:31.919
You know, just in case you get diarrhea.

230
00:12:32.009 --> 00:12:33.918
- Mom.
- I am so excited.

231
00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:35.041
Aren't you excited, Harry?

232
00:12:35.136 --> 00:12:36.844
I'm very excited.

233
00:12:37.805 --> 00:12:39.465

Absolutely.

Because if you do, that is so not cool.

Listen, about last night...

355
00:21:09.224 --> 00:21:12.807
Yeah, you know,
I'd just really rather not talk about it.

356
00:21:13.019 --> 00:21:15.095
I really think that we should.

00:21:15.939 --> 00:21:18.939
Erik, you took a crap in my dryer.

358

- Wait.
- You know, let's just...

Let's forget about it, okay?

361
00:21:27.866 --> 00:21:30.439
Okay, but what about the other thing?

362
00:21:33.413 --> 00:21:34.693
The sex?

363
00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.030
I'm taking last night as a sign from above.

364
00:21:38.167 --> 00:21:39.994
But maybe...
I mean, if your dad didn't come down...

365
00:21:40.085 --> 00:21:43.086
Erik, I love you. I'm just...

366
00:21:43.589 --> 00:21:45.166
I'm not ready yet.

367
00:21:45.757 --> 00:21:46.955
Really?

368
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:49.708
Really.

369
00:21:49.928 --> 00:21:53.261
But I also realized just how ready you are.

370
00:21:54.181 --> 00:21:56.304
I don't wanna break up over sex.

371
00:21:56.392 --> 00:21:58.218
I don't think we have to.

372
00:21:59.186 --> 00:22:03.598
I'm not ready. You are.
It's selfish for me to keep you tied down.

373
00:22:05.442 --> 00:22:07.932
So, this is what I'm proposing.

374
00:22:09.237 --> 00:22:11.525
A guilt-free pass for this weekend.

375
00:22:11.614 --> 00:22:14.780
That means you can do
whatever you want up there

You're sure about this?

378
00:22:20.997 --> 00:22:24.580
I don't think love and sex
have to be tied to each other,

379
00:22:25.543 --> 00:22:27.500
so I'm okay with this.

380
00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.123
One weekend. Get it out of your system,

381
00:22:32.508 --> 00:22:34.299

391

There is no problem.

392
00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.532
Tracy just gave me
a guilt-free pass for the weekend,

393
00:23:05.621 --> 00:23:08.028
which means I can do anything I want.

Yeah, she said
that love and sex don't have to be linked.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.540

the lamest to the coolest in one shot.

some sort of a test?

- No, no.
- No, no.

401
00:23:27.849 --> 00:23:29.308
Tracy's a smart girl.

402
00:23:29.392 --> 00:23:31.100
She's mature enough to see
that you're a man...

- Yeah.

But you guys told me
I had to give him a reason to stick around.

Yeah, you give him a reason,

what do you think's gonna happen?

That it will get it out of his system.

Oh, yeah. That's how it works.

he's not gonna go back
to rubbing his dick on the outside of the lid.

if you're gonna run in the Naked Mile?

No, not yet.

- Hey, Mr. Levenstein.
- Hello, Erik, good to see you.

894
00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:23.868
Yeah. Wow, I haven't seen you
since my parents' New Year's party, right?

Yes, well, your folks really,
really know how to ring in the new year.

giving you that wedgie in front of everybody.

Well, your dad's been doing
that to me since we were kids,

and strangely enough, I enjoy it.

Oh, well, I went to school here

901
00:56:47.149 --> 00:56:50.933
and, you know, I like to come
back every now and then

902
00:56:51.403 --> 00:56:52.862
and check out the campus.

- Okay.

Mr. Levenstein, you were a counselor

910
00:57:16.259 --> 00:57:18.465
at Tall Oaks Band Camp
with my cousin, Matt, right?

911
00:57:18.553 --> 00:57:22.004
Yes. Yes, I was. And your cousin Matt
needed some counseling...

912
00:57:22.098 --> 00:57:25.881
- Yeah.
...I might add. I gave him some advice.

913
00:57:25.976 --> 00:57:28.930
Advice. Do you think I could

914
00:57:31.439 --> 00:57:33.432
confide something in you?

915
00:57:33.733 --> 00:57:36.568
Well, sure. Yes, Erik, anything. Anything.

00:57:36.652 --> 00:57:37.815

Well, so you're a virgin. What's the big deal?

922
00:57:53.251 --> 00:57:57.793
Well, the other night, my girlfriend and I...
We tried to, you know...

923
00:57:59.923 --> 00:58:03.422
Right. But her father
came down before we had the chance to.

924
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:05.835
So she changed her mind
completely about the sex,

925
00:58:05.929 --> 00:58:09.013
but she gave me a guilt-free
pass for the weekend.

926
00:58:09.098 --> 00:58:11.423
You got the guilt-free pass?

927

928
00:58:14.937 --> 00:58:19.894
Well, I mean,
you've got the old guilt-free pass dilemma.

- Yeah.
- It's a tough one.

I didn't think people your age
knew about that kind of stuff.

931

I believe I know more
about this than you think.

don't know what to do here.

935
00:58:39.709 --> 00:58:41.915
went through kind of a similar dilemma.

936
00:58:42.003 --> 00:58:43.876
He was going out with this very attractive

937
00:58:43.963 --> 00:58:45.920
foreign-exchange student named Nadia.

938
00:58:46.006 --> 00:58:49.422
Right, right, yeah. That's the one he blew his
load too early with, right?

939
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:50.624
- Yes.
- Twice.

940
00:58:50.719 --> 00:58:52.047
- Yes.
- Over the Internet.

941
00:58:52.137 --> 00:58:53.797
- Yes, that's the one.
- Yeah.

942
00:58:53.889 --> 00:58:57.222

943
00:58:57.308 --> 00:58:58.387
Yeah.

944
00:58:58.476 --> 00:59:00.801
The next summer Nadia came
to visit Jim at the beach,

945
00:59:00.895 --> 00:59:02.353
and he turned her down

946
00:59:02.438 --> 00:59:05.807
because he had fallen in love with Michelle,

947
00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:10.647
who he later married,
and is now the mother of my grandchild.

948
00:59:11.946 --> 00:59:15.730
So you're saying
I shouldn't hook up with this sorority girl?

949
00:59:16.075 --> 00:59:19.242

only you know the answer to that, Erik.

Have you seen her?

I know you gave me this pass,
but I didn't use it.

I mean I did use it,
but it was only for a few seconds.

I couldn't go through with it,
so I came here looking for you, okay?

I really don't.
