1
00:49:40.311 --> 00:49:43.230
The Vatican announced today...

2
00:49:43.314 --> 00:49:47.109
That Pope Paul VI has canceled
his Sunday blessing...

3
00:49:47.234 --> 00:49:49.069
Due to ill health.

4
00:49:49.236 --> 00:49:52.198
His physician has ordered
total bedrest...

5
00:49:52.406 --> 00:49:55.201
And cessation of all activities.

6
00:50:37.284 --> 00:50:40.788
The purpose of this meeting
is to ratify...

7
00:50:41.038 --> 00:50:44.583
The motion passed by our
shareholders in New York.

8
01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:35.440
What do you think about Altobello?

9
01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:39.111
A very talented man.

10
01:26:39.611 --> 01:26:43.615
He has kept the peace between our
Sicilian and American friends.

11
01:26:44.533 --> 01:26:46.868
The Saint of reason.

12
01:27:05.011 --> 01:27:09.933
The Corleones left drugs, so New York
is weak, and Palermo is strong.

13
01:27:11.476 --> 01:27:15.564
Your enemies always get strong
on what you leave behind.

14
01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:22.571
Who could give the order
for that massacre...

15
01:27:24.448 --> 01:27:28.410
And still pressure the Vatican deal?

16
01:27:28.577 --> 01:27:33.749
Only Lucchesi can reach
between these two worlds.

17
01:28:02.611 --> 01:28:07.032
Is there someone in the
church we can turn to?

18
01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:10.702
Someone we can tell
our problem to?

19
01:28:12.078 --> 01:28:14.122
Cardinal Lamberto.

20
01:28:14.289 --> 01:28:19.628
A wise and good man...
Very influential.

21
01:28:20.045 --> 01:28:23.215
He will see you.

22
01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:02.587
Politics and crime,
they're the same thing.

23
01:38:37.829 --> 01:38:40.706
The wheelchair, for Don Tommasino.

24
01:44:48.783 --> 01:44:53.788
Pope Paul VI, Supreme Pontiff
of the Roman Catholic Church...

25
01:44:54.038 --> 01:44:57.291
Died last night at 9:40 P.M.

26
01:44:57.875 --> 01:45:01.128
The Pope was 81 years old,...

27
01:45:02.087 --> 01:45:05.633
And had been in poor health
for the last several months.

28
01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:53.467
I am honoured, Don Altobello, that
you've come from Palermo to visit me.

29
01:47:56.804 --> 01:48:01.809
Hey, the little kid! He's grown.

30
01:48:02.393 --> 01:48:04.228
Do the donkey for me.

31
01:48:21.829 --> 01:48:25.916
It's been some time since we
did business together.

32
01:48:29.837 --> 01:48:34.842
You are my "ace in the hole,"
as we say in America.

33
01:48:34.925 --> 01:48:40.806
I have a stone in my shoe.
You can remove it.

34
01:48:48.105 --> 01:48:50.983
Only one stone?

35
01:48:53.027 --> 01:48:58.949
It's dangerous. A famous man.

36
01:48:59.199 --> 01:49:02.703
You will have to take precautions.

37
01:49:05.539 --> 01:49:11.003
Tell me what to do.
Then I will tell you my price.

38
01:49:15.215 --> 01:49:18.010
Ah, what bread!

39
01:49:22.056 --> 01:49:26.226
Olive oil...

40
01:49:29.396 --> 01:49:32.900
Virgin... only in Sicily.

41
01:49:36.653 --> 01:49:39.573
To death.

42
01:55:27.712 --> 01:55:30.715
"Oh father, my father!"

43
01:55:31.383 --> 01:55:33.760
"Give me some time to pray
to the lord."

44
01:55:34.886 --> 01:55:38.014
The Baroness of Carini had
betrayed her husband...

45
01:55:38.557 --> 01:55:41.351
And fallen in love with her cousin.

46
01:55:41.726 --> 01:55:43.812
"There will be no forgiveness!"

47
01:55:44.062 --> 01:55:47.691
Her father stabbed her through
the heart.

48
01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:17.572
Father, where are you going?
Would you like a ride?

49
01:57:26.665 --> 01:57:30.961
I know you. You're Mosca
of Montelepre.

50
01:57:32.087 --> 01:57:35.924
You were an assassin then
and you're an assassin now.

51
01:57:36.132 --> 01:57:39.469
I know Michael Corleone
is at your house.

52
01:57:39.803 --> 01:57:42.138
I will pass through the gates
with you.

53
02:02:59.706 --> 02:03:02.041
What is it? What's wrong?

54
02:03:02.292 --> 02:03:05.128
They found Don Tommasino shot.

55
02:03:06.421 --> 02:03:08.631
Is he dead?

56
02:03:10.383 --> 02:03:13.928
My master is dead.
Blood calls for blood.

57
02:03:14.596 --> 02:03:17.432
I must have revenge!

58
02:03:21.227 --> 02:03:26.441
Some day, you may have to do
a difficult service for me.

59
02:03:26.608 --> 02:03:28.234
Command me.

60
02:03:31.321 --> 02:03:33.489
I will avenge him!

61
02:03:48.671 --> 02:03:50.131
Totals...

62
02:03:52.133 --> 02:03:54.510
Lorscheider, 1 vote.

63
02:03:55.178 --> 02:03:58.264
Siri, 11 votes.

64
02:03:58.932 --> 02:04:02.018
Lamberto, 99 votes.

65
02:04:07.482 --> 02:04:12.820
Do you accept your election
as supreme pontiff?

66
02:04:13.446 --> 02:04:19.202
Oh God, shed light on the decision
they have taken on my behalf.

67
02:04:20.119 --> 02:04:21.788
I accept.

68
02:04:21.955 --> 02:04:24.624
By what name do you
wish to be called?

69
02:04:24.874 --> 02:04:27.877
John Paul the first.

70
02:04:57.573 --> 02:05:02.412
I will do things "right away,"
rather than in "a little while"...

71
02:21:19.054 --> 02:21:21.556
Mr Lucchesi's house?

72
02:21:23.183 --> 02:21:27.396
I bring a message from
Michael Corleone.

73
02:21:28.814 --> 02:21:30.190
Let him in.

74
02:28:21.518 --> 02:28:24.979
Tea, your Holiness? 
It will help you sleep.

75
02:28:48.670 --> 02:28:51.673
This is from Vincent Corleone.

76
02:31:05.932 --> 02:31:08.643
The holy father is dead!

77
02:33:53.141 --> 02:33:55.226
Speak... tell me.

78
02:33:56.644 --> 02:34:03.067
You have lost the
faith of the people.

79
02:34:04.360 --> 02:34:08.865
He who builds on the people
builds on mud.

80
02:34:09.240 --> 02:34:13.077
And Michael Corleone's message?

81
02:34:29.802 --> 02:34:36.309
It's very important.
I must whisper it in your ear.

82
02:34:40.146 --> 02:34:42.148
He's clean.

83
02:35:00.625 --> 02:35:03.336
Power wears out those
who don't have it.
