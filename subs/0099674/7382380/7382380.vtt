00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:49.692
<i>My dear children.</i>

2
00:01:51.193 --> 00:01:55.489
<i>It is now better than several years
since I moved to New York</i>

3
00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:58.659
<i>and I haven't seen you
as much as I would like to.</i>

4
00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:04.040
<i>I hope you will come to this
ceremony of Papal honors,</i>

5
00:02:04.832 --> 00:02:06.626
<i>given for my charitable work.</i>

6
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.422
<i>The only wealth
in this world is children.</i>

7
00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:15.051
<i>More than all the money
and power on earth,</i>

8
00:02:16.927 --> 00:02:17.928
<i>you are my treasure.</i>

9
00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:21.974
<i>Anthony and Mary,</i>

10
00:02:23.225 --> 00:02:25.561
<i>although I entrusted your education
to your mother</i>

11
00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:26.854
<i>for your own best interest,</i>

12
00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:33.444
<i>I look forward to seeing you, and to
a new period of harmony in our lives.</i>

13
00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:39.533
<i>Perhaps you might prevail upon your
mother to come to this celebration,</i>

14
00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:45.289
<i>and that from time to time, we can all
see each other at family functions.</i>

15
00:02:46.957 --> 00:02:51.045
<i>Anyway, I remain your loving father.</i>

16
00:03:21.158 --> 00:03:23.285
Hail Mary, full of grace...

17
00:03:27.331 --> 00:03:29.375
...blessed art Thou amongst women...

18
00:03:30.668 --> 00:03:32.712
...and blessed is the fruit
of Thy womb, Jesus.

19
00:03:35.005 --> 00:03:38.718
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

20
00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:10.040
Almighty God, bless the insignia
of Saint Sebastian the martyr,

21
00:04:10.124 --> 00:04:11.709
that it may contribute

22
00:04:12.793 --> 00:04:16.005
to the sacredness of him
to whom it is given.

23
00:04:28.976 --> 00:04:32.146
Do you, Michael,
promise to be faithful

24
00:04:32.563 --> 00:04:34.899
to the noble purposes of this Order,

25
00:04:36.066 --> 00:04:40.529
to have a special care for the poor,
the needy and those who are ill?

26
00:04:40.821 --> 00:04:42.114
I do so promise.

27
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.674
May the blessing of Almighty God,

28
00:05:01.342 --> 00:05:05.846
Father, Son and Holy Spirit

29
00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:11.435
descend upon you
and remain with you forever.

30
00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:47.656
Vincent, our name is not on the list.

31
00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:54.371
Write it in. Mancini. M-A-N-C-I-N-I.

32
00:06:56.457 --> 00:06:58.876
-Problem?
-My name isn't on the list.

33
00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:03.589
-Then you have to leave immediately.
-You want to dance with me?

34
00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:06.967
Joe, it's Vinnie.
These are our guests.

35
00:07:07.384 --> 00:07:09.136
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Sir.

36
00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:10.888
Welcome to the party.

37
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:08.904
-It's good to see you.
-Good to see you. This is my husband.

38
00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.614
-Sit down.
-My son, Anthony.

39
00:08:12.449 --> 00:08:17.246
The Order of Saint Sebastian is one of
the highest honors the Church awards.

40
00:08:17.746 --> 00:08:19.957
It was first granted by Pope...

41
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.043
What about Mr. Corleone's connections
with gambling?

42
00:08:24.003 --> 00:08:25.295
The press Kits have...

43
00:08:25.713 --> 00:08:27.840
What about his involvement
with the underworld?

44
00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:29.091
Cut the crap.

45
00:08:30.175 --> 00:08:32.553
The Pope, the Holy Father himself,

46
00:08:33.137 --> 00:08:37.725
has today blessed Michael Corleone.
Do you know better than the Pope?

47
00:08:38.934 --> 00:08:41.478
Vincent! She loves you.

48
00:08:41.812 --> 00:08:42.855
Yeah?

49
00:08:47.568 --> 00:08:48.861
I love you too.

50
00:08:55.117 --> 00:08:57.703
Hi, Vincent. I remember you.

51
00:08:59.747 --> 00:09:03.751
-From where?
-The last party we were at together.

52
00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:06.962
-Did you come to the club?
-No, it was a wedding.

53
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.925
I was eight and you were 15.

54
00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:16.055
I Had many girlfriends when I was 15.

55
00:09:16.263 --> 00:09:18.348
-Eight-year-olds?
-Especially them.

56
00:09:20.642 --> 00:09:21.769
Where's Mary?

57
00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:27.066
Would somebody please hail Mary?
Excuse me, Your Excellency.

58
00:09:28.108 --> 00:09:31.987
You haven't kissed me hello yet.
Relatives always Kiss.

59
00:09:32.821 --> 00:09:35.115
-Now we're related?
-I'm your little cousin.

60
00:09:43.707 --> 00:09:46.460
-Who's your father?
-I'll give you a hint.

61
00:09:48.003 --> 00:09:49.129
He's Italian.

62
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.633
Mary, we've been waiting for you.

63
00:09:53.383 --> 00:09:57.262
Remember to keep your voice low.

64
00:09:57.679 --> 00:09:59.973
And smile. Don't forget to smile.

65
00:10:20.536 --> 00:10:24.123
The honorary chairman of
the Vito Corleone Foundation,

66
00:10:24.748 --> 00:10:26.750
my daughter, Mary Corleone.

67
00:10:36.885 --> 00:10:38.053
Thanks.

68
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.268
I think I inherited my father's love
for speech making. Here it goes.

69
00:10:46.228 --> 00:10:50.399
The Vito Corleone Foundation helps
the poor in every country,

70
00:10:50.858 --> 00:10:54.695
gives grants to artists,
funds medical research,

71
00:10:55.237 --> 00:10:59.366
and is particularly dedicated
to the resurrection of Sicily.

72
00:11:00.534 --> 00:11:02.035
Archbishop Gilday,

73
00:11:02.828 --> 00:11:07.124
here is 100 million dollars
for the poor of Sicily,

74
00:11:07.332 --> 00:11:09.042
in the name of Vito Corleone.

75
00:11:09.793 --> 00:11:11.670
Don't spend it all in one place.

76
00:11:29.938 --> 00:11:34.193
Mary, I'm so proud of you.

77
00:11:42.284 --> 00:11:43.452
Michael...

78
00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:46.371
You've done a wonderful thing
for Sicily.

79
00:11:47.998 --> 00:11:50.876
Let's hope that the money gets
to the people who need it.

80
00:11:51.543 --> 00:11:52.669
Amen.

81
00:11:53.086 --> 00:11:57.883
...the most important part:
Johnny Fontanel

82
00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:09.895
Thank you very much.
I'm happy to be here.

83
00:12:09.978 --> 00:12:12.439
I would like you to join me
in honoring

84
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:15.150
Commendatore Michael Corleone.

85
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.783
I have something special
for our godfather.

86
00:12:23.367 --> 00:12:27.579
I happen to know his favorite song.
Michael, where are you going?

87
00:12:27.996 --> 00:12:30.874
I'm off to the Kitchen
to hear some Tony Bennett records.

88
00:12:33.001 --> 00:12:35.420
Your favorite song, "Salsiccia's Own".

89
00:12:35.504 --> 00:12:37.839
I'm having a salsiccia sandwich.
I'll be back.

90
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:14.626
Hello, Kay.

91
00:13:25.095 --> 00:13:27.764
Congratulations, Michael.
That's quite an honor.

92
00:13:28.265 --> 00:13:30.475
But a little expensive,
wouldn't you say?

93
00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:36.648
-Cake?
-No, thank you.

94
00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:53.915
-It's been a long time, hasn't it?
-Yeah.

95
00:13:54.082 --> 00:13:55.667
-Eight years.
-Yeah.

96
00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.378
You look wonderful.

97
00:14:02.257 --> 00:14:04.384
Your son has something
he wants to talk to you about.

98
00:14:04.885 --> 00:14:06.178
I came here for him.

99
00:14:41.797 --> 00:14:47.052
-What's wrong with being a lawyer?
-He wants his life to be in music.

100
00:14:49.137 --> 00:14:52.933
Music is great, I love music.
But he should finish what he started.

101
00:14:53.517 --> 00:14:54.559
Anthony...

102
00:14:55.477 --> 00:14:57.604
-I'm going my own way.
-Your own way?

103
00:14:58.855 --> 00:15:00.065
-Professional singer?
-Yes.

104
00:15:00.816 --> 00:15:03.693
What happens if you fail?

105
00:15:04.111 --> 00:15:06.988
-I won't fail.
-Men always believe that.

106
00:15:07.322 --> 00:15:11.326
A law degree is like taking
out insurance.

107
00:15:12.327 --> 00:15:15.705
-After that you can work for me...
-I will never work for you.

108
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:19.000
I have bad memories.

109
00:15:21.169 --> 00:15:23.547
Every family has bad memories.

110
00:15:27.592 --> 00:15:29.052
I'll always be your son,

111
00:15:29.719 --> 00:15:31.555
but won't have anything to do
with your business.

112
00:15:34.516 --> 00:15:37.727
Anthony... finish the law degree.

113
00:15:39.479 --> 00:15:40.647
No.

114
00:15:58.123 --> 00:16:02.169
Well, that he got from you. That "no”.

115
00:16:05.046 --> 00:16:09.885
-You could've helped me convince him.
-Convince him of what?

116
00:16:10.802 --> 00:16:11.887
Of what?

117
00:16:13.096 --> 00:16:17.684
He throws his life away.
He throws greatness away.

118
00:16:18.727 --> 00:16:19.853
This is greatness?

119
00:16:21.897 --> 00:16:25.692
Now that you're so respectable,
you're more dangerous than ever.

120
00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:30.322
I preferred you when you were
just a common Mafia hood.

121
00:16:31.823 --> 00:16:32.991
Okay.

122
00:16:34.284 --> 00:16:37.454
-Can we talk common sense here?
-All right.

123
00:16:44.544 --> 00:16:46.087
Tony knows that you killed Fredo.

124
00:16:53.637 --> 00:16:56.431
-What did you come here for?
-To protect my son.

125
00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:01.811
Not to see you disguised by your
church. That was a shameful ceremony.

126
00:17:06.775 --> 00:17:08.610
I spent my life protecting my son.

127
00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:13.240
I spent my life protecting my family!

128
00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:14.908
Let's be reasonable, okay?

129
00:17:16.743 --> 00:17:20.830
That's your big thing, isn't it,
Michael? Reason,

130
00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:25.794
-backed up by murder.
-Oh, God.

131
00:17:27.504 --> 00:17:30.131
-You hate me. You hate me.
-No.

132
00:17:31.049 --> 00:17:32.259
I don't hate you.

133
00:17:34.511 --> 00:17:35.595
I dread you.

134
00:17:40.058 --> 00:17:41.434
I did what I could, Kay,

135
00:17:42.018 --> 00:17:46.022
to protect all of you
from the horrors of this world.

136
00:17:47.732 --> 00:17:49.067
But you became my horror.

137
00:17:59.619 --> 00:18:02.872
The children still love you, though.
Especially Mary.

138
00:18:06.126 --> 00:18:07.168
That's something.

139
00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:13.758
We can build on that. For their sake,

140
00:18:17.846 --> 00:18:18.888
let's try.

141
00:18:19.806 --> 00:18:24.769
Only if you let Tony go free
to have his own life, away from you.

142
00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:33.778
I'll let Tony go.

143
00:18:36.906 --> 00:18:38.074
Thank you.

144
00:19:13.068 --> 00:19:14.736
-Hi.
-Hi.

145
00:19:17.113 --> 00:19:21.785
You could hurt somebody with those.
Let me show you around.

146
00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:24.162
Can you get me an interview
with Corleone?

147
00:19:24.871 --> 00:19:27.332
No. I'm a relative,
but I can't do that.

148
00:19:27.707 --> 00:19:29.042
What else can I do for you?

149
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:32.754
-Handsome, but useless.
-Oh, yeah?

150
00:19:33.546 --> 00:19:35.840
-That's okay, I'll gamble.
-Do you like to gamble?

151
00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:40.220
Let's go to Atlantic City.
I'll show you how to gamble.

152
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.889
How do I know what numbers to bet?

153
00:19:43.139 --> 00:19:44.849
Do I look like a guy who's gonna lose?

154
00:19:45.517 --> 00:19:46.851
Well...

155
00:19:49.229 --> 00:19:50.730
Spooky-looking guy there.

156
00:19:52.232 --> 00:19:56.653
-What's a guy like that doing here?
-That's Joey Zasa's bulldog.

157
00:19:56.986 --> 00:19:58.738
-You know him?
-Yeah, I do.

158
00:20:00.073 --> 00:20:04.035
His name is Anthony Squigilaro.
They call him "The Ant".

159
00:20:05.161 --> 00:20:06.830
He dips his bullets in cyanide.

160
00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:17.716
Don Altobello.

161
00:20:19.467 --> 00:20:22.721
-I've come to pay my respects.
-grazie.

162
00:20:26.433 --> 00:20:27.976
You honor my father's friendship.

163
00:20:29.269 --> 00:20:31.020
Where is my goddaughter?

164
00:20:32.564 --> 00:20:35.191
-Constanza!
-Don Altobello.

165
00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:39.904
It was not so long ago
that [ held you in these old hands.

166
00:20:48.663 --> 00:20:53.626
Michael, I've lost all the venom,
all the juice of youth.

167
00:20:54.002 --> 00:20:59.007
I've lost the lust for women,
and now my mind is clear.

168
00:20:59.841 --> 00:21:05.805
My duty to God is clear.
I have a special favor to ask of you.

169
00:21:07.807 --> 00:21:14.606
Can I attach my name
to the Vito Corleone Foundation,

170
00:21:15.398 --> 00:21:20.236
so that you and I can be joined
in name and spirit?

171
00:21:23.031 --> 00:21:27.368
-One million dollars.
-A lot of money...

172
00:21:30.705 --> 00:21:34.083
-Godfather.
-Don Altobello, you have such a heart.

173
00:21:37.587 --> 00:21:41.174
Come, let's go and sample
some of that old vino.

174
00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.100
The Vatican knows nothing
about these shareholders.

175
00:21:52.227 --> 00:21:53.269
Goad.

176
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.896
I have a tendency to worry.

177
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.982
We've increased
our position substantially.

178
00:21:58.566 --> 00:22:02.987
-Naturally, I worry.
-Stop worrying, we have an agreement.

179
00:22:04.072 --> 00:22:06.282
Good. How do you think
I got this gray hair?

180
00:22:07.033 --> 00:22:12.664
Two seconds... Thank you for your
contribution to the swimming-pool.

181
00:22:12.997 --> 00:22:17.210
We need your help on Sam Wallace's
candidacy for judgeship.

182
00:22:17.293 --> 00:22:19.295
-We can always use a good judge.
-Thanks.

183
00:22:19.921 --> 00:22:21.047
Andrew!

184
00:22:21.589 --> 00:22:25.510
My godson Andrew Hagen.
My brother Tom's eldest boy.

185
00:22:25.593 --> 00:22:30.181
He's been assistant to Bishop Breelan
for three years.

186
00:22:30.348 --> 00:22:34.227
-Hopes to be assigned to the Vatican.
-Rome needs fine young priests.

187
00:22:34.394 --> 00:22:37.438
His mother Teresa Hagen,
Bishop Gilday.

188
00:22:38.773 --> 00:22:39.774
Honored to meet you.

189
00:22:40.316 --> 00:22:42.819
Mr. Corleone. Hi. Grace Hamilton.

190
00:22:44.612 --> 00:22:48.616
Vincent Mancini promised to tell you
about me. That maybe you'd see me.

191
00:22:49.534 --> 00:22:52.328
-Did Vincent Mancini call about her?
-No.

192
00:22:52.787 --> 00:22:55.582
You promised to stay out there,

193
00:22:55.665 --> 00:22:57.041
-twice.
-I know.

194
00:22:58.251 --> 00:23:02.130
Joey Zasa showed up.
He's waiting in the lobby.

195
00:23:02.255 --> 00:23:05.717
He wants to personally
congratulate you. Show his respect.

196
00:23:06.634 --> 00:23:11.222
-Do I have to see him?
-He says you're his patron.

197
00:23:14.809 --> 00:23:16.936
Hey, Vinnie!

198
00:23:17.937 --> 00:23:19.564
-Who's your favorite aunt?
-You are.

199
00:23:23.318 --> 00:23:25.695
Today I'll talk to Michael
about your little problem.

200
00:23:27.614 --> 00:23:30.199
If you'd warned me,
I would have worn a better suit.

201
00:23:32.452 --> 00:23:34.871
The Meucci Association has elected you

202
00:23:35.413 --> 00:23:37.498
Italian-American Man of the Year.

203
00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:41.044
Meucci...

204
00:23:44.213 --> 00:23:45.590
Who's Meucci?

205
00:23:46.883 --> 00:23:52.931
The Italian-American who invented
the telephone, one year before Bell.

206
00:23:56.726 --> 00:23:59.687
And this is the reason
you've come today?

207
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:08.237
I...

208
00:24:11.532 --> 00:24:13.826
I've got a stone in my shoe.

209
00:24:15.328 --> 00:24:17.580
A two-bit punk who works for me.

210
00:24:18.456 --> 00:24:21.876
The one who thinks
he's related to you.

211
00:24:24.462 --> 00:24:25.630
A bastard.

212
00:24:29.592 --> 00:24:34.097
He's here. Vincent Mancini.
He's at the party.

213
00:24:37.558 --> 00:24:38.935
Bring him in.

214
00:24:40.436 --> 00:24:42.814
I think it's good that we talk.

215
00:24:43.648 --> 00:24:45.608
No, grazie.

216
00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.612
I have a problem...

217
00:24:50.113 --> 00:24:56.452
...and I want to find out if it is
my problem or your problem.

218
00:24:56.536 --> 00:25:01.624
Your business is your business. I have
no interests or percentages from it.

219
00:25:02.959 --> 00:25:06.129
Good. Then it's my problem.

220
00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:14.887
Michael, you know Vincent Mancini.
Sonny's boy.

221
00:25:16.889 --> 00:25:20.018
-How are you, Mr. Corleone?
-How are you?

222
00:25:20.101 --> 00:25:23.896
-Good. How are you? Good party.
-You like it?

223
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:27.233
-Yes, I had to sneak in.
-You're dressed for it.

224
00:25:31.904 --> 00:25:35.825
So, what's the trouble
between you and Mr. Joe Zasa?

225
00:25:38.119 --> 00:25:42.498
-Just trouble. I'll take care of it.
-That's foolish of you.

226
00:25:42.582 --> 00:25:47.503
Foolish of me? It's a little foolish
of this guy, don't you think? Right?

227
00:25:49.172 --> 00:25:52.425
-Right?
-Temper like his father...

228
00:25:53.051 --> 00:25:54.469
Vincent...

229
00:25:56.512 --> 00:26:01.684
Mr. Joe Zasa now owns what used to
be the Corleone business in New York.

230
00:26:02.143 --> 00:26:06.022
Out of kindness, he gave you
a job in his family.

231
00:26:06.105 --> 00:26:08.941
You took it against my advice.

232
00:26:09.025 --> 00:26:14.197
I offered you something better in the
legitimate world. You turned me down.

233
00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:19.202
Now you both come to me with this bad
blood. What do you expect me to do?

234
00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:22.747
-Am I a gangster?
-No...

235
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:27.668
That was Papa's neighborhood.
Zasa runs it like a disgrace!

236
00:26:27.752 --> 00:26:31.589
-That's the past, Connie.
-I earned that territory.

237
00:26:32.173 --> 00:26:35.593
The Commission gave it to me
and you approved.

238
00:26:35.885 --> 00:26:36.969
Yes.

239
00:26:37.053 --> 00:26:41.766
I came for the party, not to ask
for help. I could kill this bastard.

240
00:26:41.849 --> 00:26:43.434
So kill him.

241
00:26:44.852 --> 00:26:47.855
What does all this have to do with me?

242
00:26:48.064 --> 00:26:53.361
Well, he goes behind your back,
saying "Fuck Michael Corleone”.

243
00:26:53.444 --> 00:26:55.947
Say it to his face, one time!

244
00:26:57.657 --> 00:27:02.662
Mr. Corleone, all bastards are liars.
Shakespeare wrote poems about it.

245
00:27:02.745 --> 00:27:05.790
What am [ going to do with this guy?

246
00:27:12.046 --> 00:27:16.717
Joey, if there's some guy
running around this city,

247
00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:19.595
saying, "Fuck Michael Corleone”...

248
00:27:20.888 --> 00:27:24.183
...what do we do
with a piece of shit like that?

249
00:27:26.602 --> 00:27:28.646
He's a fucking dog.

250
00:27:35.778 --> 00:27:39.282
Yes, it's true.
If anyone would say such a thing,

251
00:27:39.365 --> 00:27:42.618
they would not be a friend,
they would be a dog.

252
00:27:48.958 --> 00:27:55.173
-My interests don't conflict with his.
-You don't know how much they do.

253
00:27:55.256 --> 00:27:56.799
Quiet, Vincent.

254
00:27:56.924 --> 00:27:58.968
He needs your support!

255
00:27:59.051 --> 00:28:01.762
Don't let me work for this guy,
let me work for you.

256
00:28:01.846 --> 00:28:07.894
As what? Tough guy? I don't need
tough guys. I need more lawyers.

257
00:28:11.272 --> 00:28:16.194
Since we have no conflicts or debts,
[ accept your tribute.

258
00:28:16.277 --> 00:28:17.778
I wish you well.

259
00:28:19.155 --> 00:28:23.743
Vincent, make your peace
with Mr. Joe Zasa. Go on.

260
00:28:34.795 --> 00:28:36.047
Bastardo...

261
00:28:41.802 --> 00:28:44.847
Vinnie, what's the matter with you?

262
00:28:44.931 --> 00:28:47.099
Get him out of here.

263
00:28:48.809 --> 00:28:50.561
Jesus Christ...

264
00:28:51.729 --> 00:28:53.856
I told Connie
this wasn't the right time.

265
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:54.941
Close it.

266
00:28:55.024 --> 00:28:58.819
I know you're into Wall Street,
but you're still the final word.

267
00:28:58.903 --> 00:29:01.822
I want to protect you from these guys.
Your lawyers can't.

268
00:29:01.906 --> 00:29:04.700
-But you can?
-Yeah, I can do that.

269
00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:08.162
Why should I be afraid of Zasa?

270
00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:11.707
You stop him from rising
in the Commission.

271
00:29:11.791 --> 00:29:15.002
I say we make him dead.
Give me the order, I'll do it.

272
00:29:15.086 --> 00:29:16.796
-You'll do it?
-Yeah.

273
00:29:21.467 --> 00:29:26.138
Maybe you should come with me
for a few weeks. See what happens.

274
00:29:26.722 --> 00:29:28.849
-Okay.
-See if you learn.

275
00:29:30.434 --> 00:29:32.979
And we'll talk about your future.

276
00:29:34.689 --> 00:29:36.524
I won't let you down.

277
00:29:43.322 --> 00:29:44.907
It's about ready.

278
00:29:51.247 --> 00:29:52.290
So, what happened?

279
00:29:52.373 --> 00:29:53.666
What happened?

280
00:29:53.749 --> 00:29:56.919
If I'm in a room with Zasa,
what happens? I bit his ear off.

281
00:29:57.003 --> 00:29:59.338
Here we go. Watch the card.

282
00:30:02.091 --> 00:30:03.592
Hold it!

283
00:30:05.928 --> 00:30:07.638
-Vincent...
-Yeah.

284
00:30:07.722 --> 00:30:09.807
Take the picture with us.

285
00:30:17.315 --> 00:30:18.858
Nice jacket.

286
00:30:20.943 --> 00:30:23.362
Closer to the center, sir.

287
00:30:47.636 --> 00:30:52.099
Godfather, this is the cake for you
and your family from Enzo the baker.

288
00:30:53.476 --> 00:30:55.394
Do you want to do it?

289
00:31:41.524 --> 00:31:44.777
Cent'anni! Cent'anni!

290
00:32:44.128 --> 00:32:47.131
-Vincent?
-What do you want, sweetheart?

291
00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:51.135
Do you love me?

292
00:32:52.678 --> 00:32:55.181
-Come on, go to bed.
-Come on, say it.

293
00:32:57.057 --> 00:32:59.101
I love you.

294
00:32:59.727 --> 00:33:01.645
I love you, too.

295
00:33:04.064 --> 00:33:05.941
You've got a cat?

296
00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.576
Go get us some water, I'm thirsty.
Come on.

297
00:33:16.535 --> 00:33:18.120
Come on.

298
00:33:25.419 --> 00:33:28.130
Well, I guess I know my place.

299
00:33:29.006 --> 00:33:32.051
I can't believe
I'm actually doing this.

300
00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:36.388
"Get me water, bake me a cake"...
What happened to "please"?

301
00:34:24.061 --> 00:34:26.855
Good boy, Sackface. Go for a walk.

302
00:34:36.115 --> 00:34:39.201
-Let her go.
-Cut her throat, man.

303
00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:44.832
-What did you say?
-Cut her fucking throat.

304
00:34:48.002 --> 00:34:49.003
Okay, chief...

305
00:34:49.086 --> 00:34:51.046
Drop your gun or he'll cut her throat.

306
00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:55.467
I hardly know her, so cut her.
What the fuck do I care?

307
00:34:57.428 --> 00:35:01.015
You've got no choice. She'll be dead.

308
00:35:01.098 --> 00:35:05.102
If you do, I'll kill you both.
Give up that knife, I'll let you go.

309
00:35:05.185 --> 00:35:07.896
Cut her throat! Right now!

310
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.608
I'll do something
that'll convince you.

311
00:35:10.691 --> 00:35:13.944
Don't get frightened. Just watch me.

312
00:35:19.074 --> 00:35:20.534
Oh, shit!

313
00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:25.039
Drop the knife. Drop it

314
00:35:25.122 --> 00:35:27.124
Good boy.

315
00:35:27.207 --> 00:35:32.004
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
It was a wise choice. Sit down.

316
00:35:32.087 --> 00:35:33.547
Lose the mask.

317
00:35:37.009 --> 00:35:39.261
Relax, have a smoke. You smoke?

318
00:35:42.181 --> 00:35:44.642
Whose idea was this? Who sent you?

319
00:35:45.309 --> 00:35:47.019
Tell me who sent you.

320
00:35:50.564 --> 00:35:53.359
-No one.
-Did you take a look at this guy?

321
00:35:53.442 --> 00:35:55.569
-Yeah.
-Who sent you?

322
00:35:58.322 --> 00:36:00.616
It was Joey Zasa.

323
00:36:15.297 --> 00:36:16.840
Are you okay?

324
00:36:20.094 --> 00:36:23.347
-You were going to let them kill mel
-No, I wasn't...

325
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:25.808
You pig! You sick fuckl

326
00:36:28.018 --> 00:36:31.563
You wanted gambling. That's gambling.
Call the police.

327
00:36:36.485 --> 00:36:39.988
-You killed the other guy too?
-He went for my gun.

328
00:36:40.739 --> 00:36:43.909
It was self-defense.
Go ahead, call the police.

329
00:36:45.202 --> 00:36:47.246
-No, no...
-I'm taking pictures.

330
00:36:47.329 --> 00:36:48.872
No pictures.

331
00:36:50.749 --> 00:36:52.042
You had a gun!

332
00:36:52.334 --> 00:36:57.214
They only had a knife. You could have
handed them over to the police.

333
00:36:58.257 --> 00:37:01.343
Zasa sent them.
I Just sent him a message.

334
00:37:02.344 --> 00:37:07.558
-Now he has to send you one back.
-Zasa is going to send me one back?

335
00:37:07.641 --> 00:37:10.477
He did the right thing.
He got Zasa's name!

336
00:37:10.561 --> 00:37:14.356
What has Joey Zasa to do
with anything? Joey Zasa is a <i>pazzo.</i>

337
00:37:18.193 --> 00:37:20.404
All right. You are what you are.

338
00:37:21.155 --> 00:37:24.283
It's your nature. Stay close to me.

339
00:37:24.366 --> 00:37:28.245
Don't do anything. Keep your mouth
shut and your eyes open.

340
00:37:28.328 --> 00:37:31.248
-And you do what I tell you.
-I understand.

341
00:37:31.623 --> 00:37:34.752
-I have problems with the Commission.
-I know.

342
00:37:34.835 --> 00:37:39.590
-You don't make them easier.
-It wasn't my idea that this happened.

343
00:37:40.758 --> 00:37:43.010
-Get out of here.
-Michael...

344
00:37:43.635 --> 00:37:44.887
Yes?

345
00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:50.350
-Now they'll fear you.
-Maybe they should fear you.

346
00:37:54.438 --> 00:37:58.275
-B.J., what's up?
-The Archbishop just called back.

347
00:37:58.358 --> 00:38:00.944
We've arranged some amazing things.

348
00:38:01.028 --> 00:38:05.282
The publicity is phenomenal. You're
the new Rockefeller. A philanthropist.

349
00:38:07.659 --> 00:38:10.954
-Sign here, please.
-Times do change, don't they?

350
00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:16.251
My father hated foundations.
He loved doing it by himself.

351
00:38:17.252 --> 00:38:19.797
Man to man. But we're different.

352
00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:22.800
No different than
any large corporation.

353
00:38:22.883 --> 00:38:25.385
We control a lot of money with little.

354
00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:29.973
Minimize taxes.
With no government control.

355
00:38:38.857 --> 00:38:41.360
-Godfather.
-Andrew.

356
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:48.200
-Off to Rome...
-I wanted to thank you for everything.

357
00:38:48.617 --> 00:38:51.703
-Do you want some breakfast?
-Thanks, I can't.

358
00:38:52.454 --> 00:38:56.333
-How's your Italian?
<i>-Devo fare un po' di pratica.</i>

359
00:38:57.459 --> 00:38:59.795
-His father was a great lawyer.
-I know.

360
00:38:59.878 --> 00:39:04.508
Didn't live to see him ordained.
I did. Did you ever see one of those?

361
00:39:04.591 --> 00:39:08.136
Beautiful. I was so proud.
Let me walk you out.

362
00:39:09.471 --> 00:39:12.099
If you hear any rumors in the Vatican,
let me know.

363
00:39:12.182 --> 00:39:14.643
No, Andrew has the true faith.

364
00:39:24.319 --> 00:39:26.405
<i>Don Corleone,</i>

365
00:39:26.488 --> 00:39:30.409
I need your help.
And not just to light a little candle.

366
00:39:32.452 --> 00:39:39.084
My gift was to be able to persuade
people to give to the Holy Church.

367
00:39:40.252 --> 00:39:44.756
Then Rome decides to put me
in charge of the Vatican Bank...

368
00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:49.845
...but I was never a true banker.

369
00:39:53.015 --> 00:39:57.185
Mea culpa. I trusted my friends.

370
00:39:58.395 --> 00:40:00.397
Friendship and money...

371
00:40:01.523 --> 00:40:03.358
Oil and water...

372
00:40:03.442 --> 00:40:04.776
Indeed.

373
00:40:05.319 --> 00:40:12.200
But these "friends" used the good name
of the Church to feed their greed.

374
00:40:13.327 --> 00:40:15.370
If money was lost...

375
00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.957
...then I am to blame.

376
00:40:21.335 --> 00:40:26.006
If only prayer could pay off
our 700 million dollar deficit.

377
00:40:28.216 --> 00:40:30.427
769 million...

378
00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:41.563
The Church owns 25 percent
of a large corporation. Immobiliare.

379
00:40:42.522 --> 00:40:44.399
You know the one I mean?

380
00:40:44.483 --> 00:40:49.154
Largest landlord on Earth.
Real estate worth six billion dollars.

381
00:40:51.448 --> 00:40:53.408
That's true.

382
00:40:54.117 --> 00:40:57.579
And the Vatican vote
is necessary for control.

383
00:41:00.499 --> 00:41:03.043
No, you're mistaken.

384
00:41:03.585 --> 00:41:08.048
This isn't a question of one person
deciding. One deciding vote.

385
00:41:08.131 --> 00:41:13.929
This is like any other company.
We have directors and very old rules.

386
00:41:14.972 --> 00:41:18.934
The Pope himself
would have to approve you.

387
00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:25.899
We've sold the casinos.

388
00:41:27.609 --> 00:41:30.445
All businesses having to do
with gambling.

389
00:41:31.613 --> 00:41:37.327
We have no interests or investments
in anything illegitimate.

390
00:41:40.497 --> 00:41:42.541
The Corleones are prepared to deposit

391
00:41:42.624 --> 00:41:45.002
500 million dollars
in the Vatican Bank

392
00:41:45.085 --> 00:41:48.755
when Mr. Corleone receives majority
control of Immobiliare.

393
00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:53.760
Immobiliare could be something new.
A European conglomerate.

394
00:41:55.595 --> 00:41:59.433
Few families have control
of such a company.

395
00:42:02.602 --> 00:42:05.147
It seems that, in today's world,

396
00:42:05.772 --> 00:42:10.027
the power to absolve debt is greater
than the power of forgiveness.

397
00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.156
600 million dollars.

398
00:42:19.244 --> 00:42:22.289
Don't overestimate
the power of forgiveness.

399
00:42:24.499 --> 00:42:26.501
Don Corleone,

400
00:42:26.585 --> 00:42:29.588
this deal with Immobiliare
can make you

401
00:42:29.671 --> 00:42:31.673
one of the richest men in the world.

402
00:42:31.757 --> 00:42:35.052
Your whole past history,
and the history of your family,

403
00:42:35.677 --> 00:42:37.637
would be washed away.

404
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:42.893
600 million.

405
00:42:59.159 --> 00:43:03.163
<i>The motion under discussion
relates to Corleone Group's proposal</i>

406
00:43:05.874 --> 00:43:09.252
<i>to acquire 100,000,000 newly issued
Class A voting shares.</i>

407
00:43:12.923 --> 00:43:17.052
<i>...Corleone capital invested directly
into International Immobiliare,</i>

408
00:43:18.261 --> 00:43:21.723
<i>an old and respected
European company.</i>

409
00:43:22.557 --> 00:43:28.021
Mr. Corleone has an ambitious program
to expand this real estate company

410
00:43:28.105 --> 00:43:31.108
into an international conglomerate...

411
00:43:34.528 --> 00:43:39.991
...by Eastern techniques of efficiency
and focus and unlimited...

412
00:43:40.075 --> 00:43:42.160
Mr. Corleone, excuse me.

413
00:43:42.577 --> 00:43:46.039
Didn't you recently deposit
200 million in the Vatican Bank,

414
00:43:46.123 --> 00:43:49.501
which is affiliated with Immobiliare?

415
00:43:49.584 --> 00:43:51.128
True. Why not?

416
00:43:51.211 --> 00:43:57.592
Wasn't there any questioning about
the timing on this particular deposit?

417
00:43:57.676 --> 00:43:59.928
Mr. Chairman, if I may?

418
00:44:01.596 --> 00:44:06.184
The Vito Andolini Corleone Foundation,
of which Mary Corleone is chairman,

419
00:44:06.268 --> 00:44:09.646
has made an endowment
of 100 million dollars.

420
00:44:09.729 --> 00:44:11.982
The money comes from his own family

421
00:44:12.065 --> 00:44:14.276
and will be
administered by the Vatican.

422
00:44:14.359 --> 00:44:16.820
Does that answer your question?

423
00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:19.823
I have always believed that

424
00:44:19.906 --> 00:44:23.702
helping your fellow man
is profitable in every sense,

425
00:44:23.785 --> 00:44:25.954
personally and bottom line.

426
00:44:26.621 --> 00:44:32.419
My fellow shareholders, if Europe
and America can learn to co-operate,

427
00:44:32.502 --> 00:44:36.715
if we can learn to pool our wealth,
share our markets,

428
00:44:36.798 --> 00:44:41.595
we can defeat any competition
anywhere in the world.

429
00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:44.973
Thank you for your time.

430
00:44:45.056 --> 00:44:49.686
I hope that you will look favorably
on my proposal. Thank you.

431
00:44:55.734 --> 00:44:58.111
Let me have this microphone here.

432
00:44:58.195 --> 00:45:01.698
Will we let a criminal
run our company?

433
00:45:01.781 --> 00:45:04.075
He's got the map of Sicily
on his facel

434
00:45:04.159 --> 00:45:05.452
Order!

435
00:45:05.535 --> 00:45:07.954
He's either a Catholic or a mafioso...

436
00:45:10.624 --> 00:45:14.336
The Hamilton Investors Group
cannot support this proposal.

437
00:45:15.837 --> 00:45:16.838
Your Excellency...

438
00:45:18.465 --> 00:45:19.925
Mr. Chairman...

439
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:26.181
...the Vatican Bank feels
that International Immobiliare...

440
00:45:28.558 --> 00:45:32.729
...will be safe.
In Mr. Corleone's hands.

441
00:45:32.938 --> 00:45:35.899
...Subject to audit
and final ratification,

442
00:45:35.982 --> 00:45:37.859
which must take place in Rome.

443
00:45:37.943 --> 00:45:41.404
Please join me in welcoming
Mr. Michael Corleone.

444
00:45:52.123 --> 00:45:53.375
Dad?

445
00:45:56.169 --> 00:45:59.214
Tony says that I'm a front
for the foundation.

446
00:46:01.216 --> 00:46:04.052
That you're using me
to pull the strings.

447
00:46:04.719 --> 00:46:07.681
-To get the money where you want it.
-Pleasel

448
00:46:08.306 --> 00:46:11.309
-To shine up your public image.
-Mary!

449
00:46:12.477 --> 00:46:15.814
Mary, this is real.
This foundation is real.

450
00:46:18.817 --> 00:46:21.236
I wanted Anthony to be part of it.

451
00:46:21.319 --> 00:46:24.114
I thought you would be
together on this.

452
00:46:24.197 --> 00:46:28.451
I won't interfere.
I'll help, but only if you ask.

453
00:46:28.535 --> 00:46:30.537
What is this really for?

454
00:46:31.371 --> 00:46:34.624
Why are you doing this?
Why am I doing this?

455
00:46:36.376 --> 00:46:40.880
I'm doing this for my children.
You're doing it for your children too.

456
00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:45.218
This foundation is supposed to
help all people.

457
00:46:45.302 --> 00:46:47.804
That's the purpose.

458
00:46:47.887 --> 00:46:52.350
This is legitimate.
Mary, I swear, this is legitimate.

459
00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:59.691
Dad, I want this to bring me
closer to you.

460
00:47:07.991 --> 00:47:11.870
I would burn in hell to keep you safe.

461
00:47:25.675 --> 00:47:28.636
Go in the other car.
I'll ride with Michael.

462
00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:31.014
Go, go, go.

463
00:47:44.944 --> 00:47:50.241
As your family's oldest friend, I'm
always chosen to bring you messages.

464
00:47:52.994 --> 00:47:55.205
Tell me, Don Altobello.

465
00:47:57.916 --> 00:48:02.712
Your old partners are grateful for
the money you made them.

466
00:48:02.796 --> 00:48:04.547
They worship you...

467
00:48:05.256 --> 00:48:11.304
...but their hearts are broken,
because they think you abandoned them.

468
00:48:11.971 --> 00:48:18.520
They want to share your deal
on Immobiliare, to be a family again.

469
00:48:18.603 --> 00:48:20.897
It can purify their money.

470
00:48:23.316 --> 00:48:24.984
This I cannot do.

471
00:48:27.904 --> 00:48:30.907
Immobiliare must be legitimate.

472
00:48:33.201 --> 00:48:34.536
I know.

473
00:48:35.578 --> 00:48:37.622
But they're unhappy.

474
00:48:39.791 --> 00:48:40.917
And you?

475
00:48:42.335 --> 00:48:47.799
I ask nothing for myself.
Only peace in my old age.

476
00:48:48.174 --> 00:48:51.302
But I must please the world around me.

477
00:48:53.138 --> 00:48:58.977
Michael, your father was
a reasonable man. Learn from him.

478
00:49:01.896 --> 00:49:05.066
I learned many things from my father.

479
00:49:10.613 --> 00:49:16.286
Call a meeting, my friend,
so there are no debts or grudges.

480
00:49:17.328 --> 00:49:20.123
We will make the peace, you and I.

481
00:49:37.515 --> 00:49:40.101
<i>The Vatican announced today...</i>

482
00:49:40.185 --> 00:49:44.022
<i>that Pope Paul VI has canceled
his Sunday blessing...</i>

483
00:49:44.105 --> 00:49:46.024
<i>due to ill health.</i>

484
00:49:46.107 --> 00:49:49.277
<i>His physician has ordered
total bed rest...</i>

485
00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:52.280
<i>and cessation of all activities.</i>

486
00:50:00.246 --> 00:50:02.165
They've had a press conference.

487
00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:05.376
The Pope's condition
is grave. "Gravissimo."

488
00:50:34.155 --> 00:50:37.700
The purpose of this meeting
is to ratify...

489
00:50:38.034 --> 00:50:41.371
the motion passed by our
shareholders in New York.

490
00:50:43.289 --> 00:50:44.415
Please...

491
00:50:45.458 --> 00:50:50.213
Our group represents a consortium
of Catholic businessmen

492
00:50:50.296 --> 00:50:53.132
against the Corleone control.

493
00:50:53.883 --> 00:50:56.219
The Vatican has cast its vote.

494
00:50:56.302 --> 00:50:58.721
Corleone Group
already controls the Board.

495
00:50:59.264 --> 00:51:04.060
According to the Lateran Treaty, the
Vatican vote must be ratified here.

496
00:51:04.143 --> 00:51:06.312
Here in Rome, by the Pope.

497
00:51:10.233 --> 00:51:13.111
The Pope is gravely ill.

498
00:51:14.737 --> 00:51:18.199
Until he recovers, I am powerless.

499
00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:22.370
-What if he dies?
-Then...

500
00:51:23.371 --> 00:51:26.583
...as you Americans say,
all bets are off.

501
00:51:27.083 --> 00:51:28.960
Gentlemen, please.

502
00:51:30.253 --> 00:51:33.673
This is a brief delay. Nothing more.

503
00:51:38.803 --> 00:51:41.139
Your Excellency, gentlemen...

504
00:51:42.223 --> 00:51:47.478
I advise you to join us in our prayers
for the Holy Father's recovery.

505
00:51:49.063 --> 00:51:50.815
We had an agreement!

506
00:51:52.191 --> 00:51:55.945
This meeting was to be
merely a formality.

507
00:51:56.029 --> 00:52:01.367
-Please sit down.
-I'd rather stand. Give me an answer.

508
00:52:01.451 --> 00:52:06.956
The Immobiliare has its roots in the
European tradition. Please understand.

509
00:52:07.832 --> 00:52:11.085
I understand.
Your tactics are despicable.

510
00:52:11.169 --> 00:52:14.339
That's quite an indictment,
coming from a Corleone.

511
00:52:14.422 --> 00:52:18.801
-Gentlemen, gentlemen!
-Remember you are in the Vatican.

512
00:52:22.722 --> 00:52:28.311
-What is it that you want?
-Yes, you will take control.

513
00:52:29.479 --> 00:52:33.024
We'll gladly put you at the helm
of our little fleet,

514
00:52:33.524 --> 00:52:37.320
but our ships must all sail
in the same direction.

515
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:44.494
Otherwise, who can say how long
your stay with us will last?

516
00:52:46.746 --> 00:52:52.585
It's not personal. It's only business.
You should know, Godfather.

517
00:52:56.631 --> 00:52:58.049
Very well.

518
00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:04.222
You want to do business with me?
I will do business with you.

519
00:53:05.264 --> 00:53:07.183
Vipers, all of them.

520
00:53:13.272 --> 00:53:16.401
-We're back with the Borgias!
-Uncle Michael...

521
00:53:16.484 --> 00:53:19.862
-Andrew!
-I heard you were here.

522
00:53:19.946 --> 00:53:23.408
It's so nice to see you.
Vincent, it's so nice.

523
00:53:24.242 --> 00:53:27.704
What is this about the Borgias?
Those days are over.

524
00:53:33.167 --> 00:53:35.044
-Recognize it?
-Yeah.

525
00:53:36.838 --> 00:53:41.509
Genco Olive Oil. That's where our
grandfather started as a delivery boy.

526
00:53:42.969 --> 00:53:45.179
Three years later he owned it.

527
00:53:45.263 --> 00:53:47.557
-Only in America.
-That's it.

528
00:53:48.599 --> 00:53:53.771
Vincenzo, where have you been hiding?
We need your help so badly.

529
00:53:53.855 --> 00:53:55.481
What can I do for you?

530
00:53:55.565 --> 00:53:57.734
Get rid of Joe Zasa. He sells drugs...

531
00:53:57.817 --> 00:54:02.739
Now that I'm an older woman,
I'm afraid to go out at night.

532
00:54:02.822 --> 00:54:05.199
Where should they be now?

533
00:54:05.283 --> 00:54:08.369
-Lou, what's going on?
-We're late.

534
00:54:10.329 --> 00:54:13.124
-Have I ever let you down?
-I trust you.

535
00:54:13.207 --> 00:54:15.460
-Don't worry.
-Thank you.

536
00:54:15.543 --> 00:54:17.211
Enjoy yourselves.

537
00:54:24.093 --> 00:54:27.805
-What was that?
-The neighborhood's in trouble.

538
00:54:28.931 --> 00:54:31.684
-Do you keep an eye out for them?
-Yes.

539
00:54:31.768 --> 00:54:34.312
-And for me??
-From now on.

540
00:54:35.563 --> 00:54:39.567
-I've missed you all this time.
-I missed you too, cousin.

541
00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:42.570
I missed growing up with my cousins.

542
00:54:42.653 --> 00:54:45.114
I didn't even know you,
but missed you.

543
00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:50.077
Do you remember stories about
our fathers? The old days?

544
00:54:50.328 --> 00:54:52.830
Yeah, what do you want to know?

545
00:54:55.208 --> 00:55:00.379
-What was Sonny like?
-Well, he was the Prince of the City.

546
00:55:02.048 --> 00:55:05.635
He died before I was born,
but I've heard a lot about him.

547
00:55:07.303 --> 00:55:10.932
-What about my father?
-He's a great man.

548
00:55:12.308 --> 00:55:14.852
He's a hero. He saved the family.

549
00:55:16.813 --> 00:55:18.481
-Vincent?
-What?

550
00:55:18.564 --> 00:55:20.942
Did he kill his own brother?

551
00:55:25.112 --> 00:55:26.322
No.

552
00:55:29.033 --> 00:55:30.660
So, it's all lies?

553
00:55:35.122 --> 00:55:38.334
Just stories, sweetheart. Okay?

554
00:55:42.505 --> 00:55:43.756
Okay.

555
00:55:45.508 --> 00:55:47.260
I believe you.

556
00:55:48.261 --> 00:55:51.722
-I'm glad you're around.
-I'm glad you're here too.

557
00:55:56.602 --> 00:55:58.229
<i>Cugina...</i>

558
00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:00.523
Cous...

559
00:56:14.996 --> 00:56:18.416
I'd like to take Joey Zasa for a ride
in this and drop him.

560
00:56:18.666 --> 00:56:20.918
Joey Zasa is nothing.

561
00:56:21.752 --> 00:56:25.339
He's a small time enforcer.
He bluffs and threatens.

562
00:56:25.423 --> 00:56:29.218
He's nothing.
You can see him coming a mile away.

563
00:56:30.219 --> 00:56:32.972
-We should kill him before he...
-No!

564
00:56:36.142 --> 00:56:40.313
Never hate your enemies.
It affects your judgment.

565
00:56:56.495 --> 00:56:59.290
Nice to see you again, Mr. Corleone.

566
00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:21.646
Hey, girls. Let's go.

567
00:57:39.664 --> 00:57:44.168
We trusted you to manage
our money in the casinos.

568
00:57:44.251 --> 00:57:46.462
It's not even 20 years.

569
00:57:46.545 --> 00:57:50.132
You've sold the casinos
and made fortunes for all of us.

570
00:57:50.216 --> 00:57:52.218
Bravo, Don Corleone!

571
00:57:54.637 --> 00:57:56.180
Thank you.

572
00:57:56.889 --> 00:58:03.562
Friends, I have come here
because our business together is done.

573
00:58:05.356 --> 00:58:07.274
We have prospered,

574
00:58:07.358 --> 00:58:12.321
and now it is time for us to dissolve
the business relationship between us.

575
00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:16.158
That's it.

576
00:58:16.242 --> 00:58:19.328
But I do have a little surprise. Al?

577
00:58:22.415 --> 00:58:24.583
Your shares in the casinos.

578
00:58:25.209 --> 00:58:27.086
I thought I cut through
all the red tape,

579
00:58:27.169 --> 00:58:29.171
so you could get your money
right away.

580
00:58:35.761 --> 00:58:38.222
50 million dollars!

581
00:58:38.305 --> 00:58:41.726
-Not everybody gets the same.
-Nothing for you...

582
00:58:41.809 --> 00:58:46.856
-It depends on your investment.
-Michael, this is really generous!

583
00:58:47.898 --> 00:58:49.275
Wonderful!

584
00:58:52.528 --> 00:58:56.949
-Parisi, how much did you invest?
-I don't remember.

585
00:58:57.658 --> 00:58:59.326
You're blessed.

586
00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:09.211
My family has done much of
the hard work, taken many risks.

587
00:59:11.547 --> 00:59:14.508
All to make money
for the rest of the families.

588
00:59:16.969 --> 00:59:19.013
You all know Joey Zasa.

589
00:59:19.972 --> 00:59:22.558
He is, I admit, an important man.

590
00:59:23.559 --> 00:59:27.271
His picture is on the cover
of the New York Times magazine.

591
00:59:27.772 --> 00:59:31.817
He gets the Esquire Magazine award
for the best dressed gangster.

592
00:59:33.027 --> 00:59:34.945
The newspapers praise him

593
00:59:35.029 --> 00:59:39.492
because he hires Blacks,
which shows he has a good heart.

594
00:59:42.244 --> 00:59:43.788
He is famous.

595
00:59:44.455 --> 00:59:50.669
Who knows? Maybe one day
he'll make all of you popular.

596
00:59:52.463 --> 00:59:53.464
It's true.

597
00:59:53.547 --> 00:59:59.428
I make more of a Bella figura.
That is my nature.

598
00:59:59.512 --> 01:00:04.391
But I also want to make a move
into legitimate enterprises.

599
01:00:04.475 --> 01:00:07.353
I'd like a little pin from the Pope.

600
01:00:07.728 --> 01:00:12.900
Sure, I take the Blacks
and the Spanish into my family,

601
01:00:12.983 --> 01:00:16.445
because that's America.

602
01:00:17.279 --> 01:00:20.491
And you guarantee
that they don't deal drugs?

603
01:00:22.493 --> 01:00:27.039
I don't guarantee that. I guarantee
that I'll ill anybody who does.

604
01:00:31.627 --> 01:00:36.841
-Let me talk to him.
-Who can refuse Don Altobello?

605
01:00:37.466 --> 01:00:39.552
-Joey, are you...
-No!

606
01:00:40.553 --> 01:00:45.724
I say to all of you, I have been
treated this day with no respect.

607
01:00:46.934 --> 01:00:52.565
I've earned you all money. I've made
you rich and I asked for little.

608
01:00:52.648 --> 01:00:56.443
Good. You will not give, so I'll take!

609
01:00:57.653 --> 01:01:00.197
As for Don Corleone,

610
01:01:00.281 --> 01:01:06.370
he makes it very clear to me today
that he is my enemy.

611
01:01:10.374 --> 01:01:12.626
You must choose between us.

612
01:01:17.089 --> 01:01:18.299
No, Joey!

613
01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.469
Michael, we could reason together.

614
01:01:23.095 --> 01:01:24.555
No.

615
01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:29.810
Michael, please... let's agree.

616
01:01:30.603 --> 01:01:32.771
He doesn't know what he's...

617
01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:34.398
No, no.

618
01:01:39.445 --> 01:01:42.156
Michael, the news is everywhere.

619
01:01:42.948 --> 01:01:47.119
Everyone says that you
control Immobiliare.

620
01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:52.333
Immobiliare is already laundering
money in Peru and Nassau.

621
01:01:53.667 --> 01:01:58.172
We've worked with you for 40 years.
We should wet our beaks a little.

622
01:01:58.255 --> 01:02:03.010
-We want to do business with you.
-That's right, we've been together...

623
01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:16.273
-It's a hit! Let's go!
-Let's get out of here! Move!

624
01:02:35.542 --> 01:02:38.170
My coat! It's my lucky coat!

625
01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:41.173
It's my lucky coat!

626
01:02:47.388 --> 01:02:48.639
Stay behind me!

627
01:03:04.863 --> 01:03:07.074
Mikey, this way!

628
01:03:15.541 --> 01:03:18.794
Zasa, you son-of-a-bitch...

629
01:03:39.106 --> 01:03:41.442
Come on. We're out of here.

630
01:04:13.766 --> 01:04:15.934
-You did good, Vincent.
-Grazie.

631
01:04:16.393 --> 01:04:19.688
The old Dons were pretty much
wiped out.

632
01:04:19.772 --> 01:04:22.733
The survivors made deals with Zasa.

633
01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:26.695
-Altobello?
-He survived.

634
01:04:26.779 --> 01:04:29.406
He's with his daughters
in Staten Island.

635
01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:31.909
He says he's going
to retire in Sicily.

636
01:04:33.535 --> 01:04:37.956
Joey Zasa would never pull something
like this without the backing.

637
01:04:38.749 --> 01:04:44.671
He's just muscle. He doesn't have
the wit for that helicopter attack.

638
01:04:44.755 --> 01:04:48.967
He doesn't even have the ambition
to wipe out the whole Commission.

639
01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:51.804
I say we hit back and take Zasa out!

640
01:04:57.559 --> 01:05:00.521
Never let anyone know
what you're thinking.

641
01:05:08.195 --> 01:05:11.156
Let's get a message to Joey Zasa.

642
01:05:14.451 --> 01:05:16.870
I respect what he's done.

643
01:05:17.746 --> 01:05:20.666
The new overthrows the old.
It's natural.

644
01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:23.794
How can you do business with this guy?

645
01:05:26.338 --> 01:05:30.426
I'm a businessman, first and foremost.
I want no further conflict.

646
01:05:30.509 --> 01:05:33.262
Tell him that
he can live or he can die.

647
01:05:33.345 --> 01:05:35.013
Vincent, will you shut up!

648
01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:54.867
That's it.

649
01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:58.745
Joey Zasa...

650
01:05:59.413 --> 01:06:01.874
He can't be doing this alone.

651
01:06:05.586 --> 01:06:09.465
Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

652
01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:23.937
Our true enemy has not yet
shown his face.

653
01:06:28.108 --> 01:06:29.526
Michael!

654
01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:39.786
-Has he had his medicine?
-I don't know what he took.

655
01:06:45.417 --> 01:06:47.753
-I've got my wind back.
-Call a doctor.

656
01:06:47.836 --> 01:06:49.796
-Run, run, run!
-Vincent!

657
01:06:49.922 --> 01:06:53.509
Run at thunder, girl!
Thunder can't hurt!

658
01:06:54.009 --> 01:06:56.053
Harmless noise!

659
01:06:56.470 --> 01:07:01.266
Bullshit! You deceitful old fuck!

660
01:07:02.142 --> 01:07:04.770
Altobello, you fuck!

661
01:07:07.814 --> 01:07:08.899
Fredo!

662
01:07:09.858 --> 01:07:11.610
Fredo!

663
01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:37.803
Oh, God! Dad!

664
01:07:40.305 --> 01:07:41.890
Excuse me.

665
01:07:42.599 --> 01:07:44.101
I'll call Ray.

666
01:07:55.028 --> 01:07:58.657
-Good evening, sir.
-Can we wait here? We'll be back soon.

667
01:08:05.289 --> 01:08:11.211
Mr. Harrison, you said it was urgent.
Have you come to confess your sins?

668
01:08:12.004 --> 01:08:16.592
Michael Corleone has had a diabetic
stroke. I wanted you to know about it.

669
01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:22.431
He's in a coma. I'm here to insist
the deal goes through in any event.

670
01:08:22.514 --> 01:08:25.058
The Pope has not much time left.

671
01:08:26.101 --> 01:08:29.938
So, as you,
I am in a difficult position.

672
01:08:30.272 --> 01:08:33.525
We have to ratify this deal
as soon as possible.

673
01:08:34.443 --> 01:08:37.237
-We have an understanding.
-Good.

674
01:08:38.697 --> 01:08:42.200
-I'm going to the hospital.
-I'll pray for Mr. Corleone.

675
01:08:46.913 --> 01:08:50.917
-Our thoughts are with Mr. Corleone.
-Thank you, Father Jim.

676
01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:56.965
Everything will be out in the open
if Corleone dies.

677
01:08:58.550 --> 01:09:00.677
Play for time, Keinszig.

678
01:09:01.386 --> 01:09:05.849
A habit born of
a long contemplation of eternity.

679
01:09:12.856 --> 01:09:16.693
-Forget about it, Vinnie.
-Why? It's a simple hit.

680
01:09:16.777 --> 01:09:22.699
I'd love to smack Joey Zasa and then
whack the fag. But it's impossible.

681
01:09:22.991 --> 01:09:28.622
He's always with people, in front of
TV cameras in his own neighborhood.

682
01:09:28.705 --> 01:09:31.291
It's not impossible.
It'll work for us.

683
01:09:31.375 --> 01:09:32.376
How?

684
01:09:32.459 --> 01:09:36.588
Do you think he's going to let
Uncle Michael survive? Would you?

685
01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:39.675
He may not survive anyway.

686
01:09:40.884 --> 01:09:43.637
-How would you do it?
-I'd do it myself.

687
01:09:46.181 --> 01:09:47.516
Do it!

688
01:09:49.851 --> 01:09:52.771
-What would you need?
-A couple of guys.

689
01:10:23.844 --> 01:10:25.387
Hello, Michael.

690
01:10:28.724 --> 01:10:30.142
It's Kay.

691
01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:36.481
Ray...

692
01:10:38.984 --> 01:10:40.986
I never expected you.

693
01:10:41.903 --> 01:10:44.114
No, I know.

694
01:10:46.450 --> 01:10:48.076
But I'm here.

695
01:10:52.164 --> 01:10:54.124
-I'm glad.
-You know...

696
01:10:57.627 --> 01:11:00.088
I've never seen you
looking so helpless.

697
01:11:04.634 --> 01:11:06.720
It's not so bad, really.

698
01:11:08.805 --> 01:11:12.768
I feel... I'm getting wiser now.

699
01:11:13.226 --> 01:11:15.187
-Yeah.
-Oh, yeah.

700
01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:19.316
The sicker you get, the wiser you get?

701
01:11:19.399 --> 01:11:22.194
When I'm dead, I'll be really smart.

702
01:11:23.862 --> 01:11:27.991
Michael...
I want to thank you for Tony.

703
01:11:31.119 --> 01:11:35.040
He's doing really well.
He's gotten some very good notices,

704
01:11:35.665 --> 01:11:40.796
and he'll make his operatic debut in
Sicily, in Palermo this Easter, so...

705
01:11:42.839 --> 01:11:43.965
So, thank you.

706
01:11:45.759 --> 01:11:48.637
That's a real honor. In Sicily.

707
01:11:53.850 --> 01:11:56.770
I will be there. I won't miss that.

708
01:11:57.521 --> 01:11:59.314
I won't miss that.

709
01:12:05.779 --> 01:12:08.114
Mary, Tony...

710
01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:11.201
Go see Dad.

711
01:12:17.082 --> 01:12:20.377
-Sweetheart!
-Everything's going to be all right.

712
01:12:21.169 --> 01:12:23.588
-Tony!
-How are you doing, Pop?

713
01:12:26.216 --> 01:12:29.427
Your mother told me what happened.

714
01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:32.764
About Palermo? I hope you'll be there.

715
01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:35.016
Of course. Kiss me.

716
01:12:54.911 --> 01:12:59.416
-Cousin Vinnie?
-He's not here. Call his apartment.

717
01:13:01.334 --> 01:13:03.795
-It's your cousin Mary.
-Let her in.

718
01:13:08.383 --> 01:13:12.596
Hi, cous. I thought I'd drop by.
Is that okay'?

719
01:13:12.679 --> 01:13:14.556
I'll get the guys.

720
01:13:16.391 --> 01:13:19.644
No, it's not okay.
You shouldn't have come, Mary.

721
01:13:21.187 --> 01:13:23.481
Only a couple of minutes, okay?

722
01:13:25.025 --> 01:13:28.028
-You look beautiful, cous.
-Thanks.

723
01:13:30.947 --> 01:13:33.450
So this is your club, your hideout?

724
01:13:34.326 --> 01:13:36.912
-Yeah.
-I came here to check it out.

725
01:13:42.083 --> 01:13:46.087
It's so strange, just me
and Aunt Connie in the house.

726
01:13:46.171 --> 01:13:50.300
-I feel better when I'm with you.
-What's wrong, sweetheart?

727
01:13:51.134 --> 01:13:53.845
-I'm scared about my father.
-Don't be.

728
01:13:53.929 --> 01:13:57.807
When they took him out of
the ambulance, I thought he was dead.

729
01:13:57.891 --> 01:14:00.685
Everybody says
he's going to be better.

730
01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:04.272
Don't worry.

731
01:14:04.773 --> 01:14:07.525
I remember a shooting
when [ was little.

732
01:14:08.693 --> 01:14:12.030
And one time Al Neri and other
bodyguards took me and Tony away.

733
01:14:15.408 --> 01:14:17.619
Is it all happening again?

734
01:14:19.245 --> 01:14:21.247
Not like that, sweetie.

735
01:14:22.749 --> 01:14:26.503
Then why are you hiding here?
Is something going to happen to you?

736
01:14:28.505 --> 01:14:32.467
Nothing's going to happen
to me, cugina. We'll take care of you.

737
01:14:43.728 --> 01:14:46.022
Can I stay here and hide out with you?

738
01:14:46.106 --> 01:14:48.191
Can you help me cook for the boys?

739
01:14:48.274 --> 01:14:51.903
You know that I don't know
how to cook, but I'll help.

740
01:15:05.083 --> 01:15:06.418
Okay...

741
01:15:07.335 --> 01:15:08.753
What do I do?

742
01:15:41.161 --> 01:15:44.039
-I love you, cous.
-I love you, too, cous.

743
01:15:47.917 --> 01:15:49.377
Let us cook.

744
01:16:06.352 --> 01:16:07.771
Hold me.

745
01:16:44.599 --> 01:16:49.312
You in the press and the police
use words like "Mafia", "Cosa Nostra".

746
01:16:49.395 --> 01:16:51.314
This is a fantasy.

747
01:16:51.397 --> 01:16:54.818
We Italian-Americans
laid the bricks that built this city.

748
01:16:54.901 --> 01:16:57.695
We have Meucci,
who invented the telephone.

749
01:16:57.779 --> 01:17:01.699
We have Don Ameche,
who played the guy who invented it.

750
01:17:02.325 --> 01:17:06.538
Buy yourself a raffle ticket,
maybe you'll win a Cadillac.

751
01:17:07.247 --> 01:17:09.499
The salsiccia is wonderful!

752
01:17:09.624 --> 01:17:11.543
Here, have a sandwich.

753
01:17:24.556 --> 01:17:27.433
-Nice to see you, Mr. Zasa.
-Have a nice time.

754
01:17:29.352 --> 01:17:31.604
Don't forget to buy
your raffle tickets.

755
01:17:35.108 --> 01:17:37.819
-What are you doing?
-He didn't mean it.

756
01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:41.364
-Tell him you're sorry.
-Okay, let's go.

757
01:18:00.466 --> 01:18:03.678
Joey! How are you?

758
01:18:03.761 --> 01:18:05.680
How are you, Buddy boy??

759
01:18:06.723 --> 01:18:09.684
Hey, Joey Zasa! Joey, up your ass!

760
01:18:11.811 --> 01:18:15.106
-Who is this? Do you know him?
-ignore him.

761
01:18:16.065 --> 01:18:19.194
Who's going to win the car? The Ant?

762
01:18:20.278 --> 01:18:24.449
This is what gives Italian-Americans
a bad name. A cappone like this.

763
01:18:24.908 --> 01:18:27.577
Joey, up your ass!

764
01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:31.247
Get off the Car!
Do you have a raffle ticket?

765
01:18:31.331 --> 01:18:34.167
Joey, take a look at my raffle ticket!

766
01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:38.880
Here's what I think of you...
and your raffle ticket.

767
01:18:39.589 --> 01:18:43.176
Get the fuck off this car.
I'll break your fucking balls.

768
01:18:45.970 --> 01:18:47.764
Get out of here!

769
01:19:03.321 --> 01:19:05.698
Run, Joey! You piece of shit!

770
01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:20.505
Open the door!

771
01:19:20.588 --> 01:19:22.548
How are you, Joe?

772
01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:27.053
Zasa!

773
01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:51.369
Don't ever again give that
kind of order. Not while I'm alive.

774
01:19:51.869 --> 01:19:52.954
Understand?

775
01:19:54.706 --> 01:20:00.962
You were too sick to make a decision.
I got a go-ahead from Neri and Connie.

776
01:20:02.046 --> 01:20:03.339
Connie?

777
01:20:13.099 --> 01:20:15.768
It was the right decision, Uncle Mike.

778
01:20:16.561 --> 01:20:20.398
It was the wrong decision.
I command this family!

779
01:20:20.815 --> 01:20:22.775
Right or wrong...

780
01:20:23.568 --> 01:20:26.446
...it was not what [ wanted!

781
01:20:45.048 --> 01:20:46.758
Do you understand?

782
01:20:53.681 --> 01:20:54.807
Yes.

783
01:21:01.481 --> 01:21:03.483
Come on, Michael.

784
01:21:14.952 --> 01:21:16.412
Yes.

785
01:21:18.498 --> 01:21:20.625
Good. Vincent,

786
01:21:20.708 --> 01:21:24.879
help me to my bed. I want to
talk to you alone for a minute.

787
01:21:32.762 --> 01:21:36.474
You know,
[ always felt responsible for you.

788
01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:39.435
You know that.

789
01:21:40.269 --> 01:21:41.813
Your father...

790
01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:45.942
...my brother, we were opposites.

791
01:21:46.776 --> 01:21:50.822
We would fight and argue.
But I never doubted his love.

792
01:21:51.948 --> 01:21:55.993
He would do anything for me.
But his temper...

793
01:21:59.747 --> 01:22:03.709
Too much. It clouded his reason.

794
01:22:05.378 --> 01:22:07.964
I don't want you to make that mistake.

795
01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.093
Also...

796
01:22:13.177 --> 01:22:15.763
...he, too, had a way with women.

797
01:22:17.849 --> 01:22:20.309
-Vincent...
-So I hear.

798
01:22:20.393 --> 01:22:22.728
What are you doing with my daughter?

799
01:22:25.606 --> 01:22:27.775
What are you doing with her?

800
01:22:32.113 --> 01:22:34.031
It's too dangerous.

801
01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:38.786
Do you hear me?

802
01:22:44.876 --> 01:22:46.085
Okay.

803
01:23:00.516 --> 01:23:02.018
Vincenzo...

804
01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:10.026
When they come,
they'll come at what you love.

805
01:23:18.784 --> 01:23:21.329
Michael, you must lead another life.

806
01:23:22.205 --> 01:23:27.251
You have everything a man could
desire. It's time for you to retire.

807
01:23:28.628 --> 01:23:30.963
I have too much responsibility.

808
01:23:32.381 --> 01:23:37.970
Immobiliare? It's too difficult now.
You should really get out.

809
01:23:38.054 --> 01:23:42.767
What do you know
about those <i>pezzi da novanta</i> in Italy?

810
01:23:46.771 --> 01:23:50.191
I'm too old to know anything
about those new people.

811
01:23:50.733 --> 01:23:54.862
I must accept my age
and grow my olives and tomatoes.

812
01:23:56.697 --> 01:24:00.076
-We're not that old.
-But you're very ill.

813
01:24:01.327 --> 01:24:05.373
Michael... Let me see
what can be done.

814
01:24:06.541 --> 01:24:09.669
Let me work to make your path
a little easier.

815
01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:15.967
-Your friendship does that always.
-That makes me happy.

816
01:24:16.676 --> 01:24:20.846
Joey Zasa...
You were wrong about him.

817
01:24:22.014 --> 01:24:25.393
I trust too much.
That's always been my fault.

818
01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:36.862
Michael... treachery is everywhere.

819
01:24:37.446 --> 01:24:41.075
You still have your fingers
on the strings, even now.

820
01:24:42.952 --> 01:24:45.246
Let's see more of each other.

821
01:24:45.955 --> 01:24:50.376
-Michael, in Sicily?
-In Sicily.

822
01:24:51.335 --> 01:24:53.170
In Sicilia.

823
01:24:54.005 --> 01:24:55.381
In Sicilia.

824
01:25:43.638 --> 01:25:45.181
How are you?

825
01:25:45.973 --> 01:25:48.768
Don Bendino, my old friend.

826
01:26:20.132 --> 01:26:25.179
I brought you here, so that my old
friend and protector, Don Tommasino,

827
01:26:25.805 --> 01:26:27.348
could advise us.

828
01:26:29.183 --> 01:26:32.019
What do you think about Altobello?

829
01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:36.148
A very talented man.

830
01:26:36.524 --> 01:26:40.486
He has kept the peace between our
Sicilian and American friends.

831
01:26:41.362 --> 01:26:43.781
The saint of reason.

832
01:26:45.825 --> 01:26:49.620
A blood bath in Atlantic City
left New York a mess.

833
01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:53.290
Joey Zasa at least was running
a tight ship,

834
01:26:53.374 --> 01:26:57.211
but with him out of the picture
we must step in.

835
01:26:57.294 --> 01:27:01.090
-Step back in...
-Or the Chinese and Colombians will.

836
01:27:02.007 --> 01:27:06.887
The Corleones left drugs, so New York
is weak, and Palermo is strong.

837
01:27:08.305 --> 01:27:12.393
Your enemies always get strong
on what you leave behind.

838
01:27:15.062 --> 01:27:19.442
Who could give the order
for that massacre...

839
01:27:21.485 --> 01:27:25.239
and still pressure the Vatican deal?

840
01:27:25.406 --> 01:27:30.661
Only Lucchesi can reach
between these two worlds.

841
01:27:32.913 --> 01:27:36.208
"Our ships must all sail
in the same direction"...

842
01:27:38.002 --> 01:27:41.338
Italian politics have had these men
for centuries.

843
01:27:41.422 --> 01:27:43.841
They are the true Mafia.

844
01:27:43.924 --> 01:27:47.303
The Archbishop and the Vatican Bank,
that's the big problem.

845
01:27:47.386 --> 01:27:51.307
They're the same problem.
B.J., they're connected.

846
01:27:52.224 --> 01:27:54.935
The Archbishop has powerful friends.

847
01:27:57.646 --> 01:27:59.148
They totally protect him.

848
01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:04.028
Is there someone in the
Church we can turn to?

849
01:28:04.195 --> 01:28:07.615
Someone we can tell
our problem to?

850
01:28:09.074 --> 01:28:11.076
Cardinal Lamberto.

851
01:28:11.327 --> 01:28:16.499
A wise and good man...
very influential.

852
01:28:16.999 --> 01:28:20.252
He will see you.

853
01:28:25.341 --> 01:28:30.805
I will see this Cardinal Lamberto
and see if we can work things out.

854
01:28:32.598 --> 01:28:37.102
You honor your agreements,
but you are dealing with crooks.

855
01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:40.272
They have no honor.

856
01:28:42.191 --> 01:28:44.026
My word is final.

857
01:28:54.995 --> 01:28:59.208
Politics and crime,
they're the same thing.

858
01:29:21.355 --> 01:29:27.903
I've invited you all here to celebrate
my son's debut in an opera house...

859
01:29:28.445 --> 01:29:30.364
We'll play "Philadelphia".

860
01:29:31.824 --> 01:29:36.120
Seven cards. Two down, four up.
Deuces and one-eyed jacks are wild.

861
01:29:36.203 --> 01:29:38.706
...in the opera
"Cavallaria Rusticana".

862
01:29:38.789 --> 01:29:43.252
-It's "Cavalleria Rusticana," Dad.
-"Cavalleria."

863
01:29:43.335 --> 01:29:45.838
I think I have tickets
to the wrong opera.

864
01:29:45.921 --> 01:29:48.007
I've been in New York too long.

865
01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:52.344
You will all receive tickets,
so come on time.

866
01:29:52.428 --> 01:29:54.638
Dad, I've got a present for you.

867
01:29:58.517 --> 01:30:02.646
It comes from the town of Corleone
and it's authentic Sicilian.

868
01:30:03.898 --> 01:30:06.984
And... I learned it for you.

869
01:31:36.907 --> 01:31:42.162
She was wonderful, beautiful.
I loved her. And then she died.

870
01:31:43.622 --> 01:31:48.544
My trusted bodyguard
planted a bomb in my car.

871
01:31:50.462 --> 01:31:52.464
She drove it before I did.

872
01:31:54.133 --> 01:31:57.219
Why is such a beautiful country
so violent?

873
01:31:57.636 --> 01:31:59.430
History.

874
01:31:59.513 --> 01:32:03.809
Mom was telling me about when your
biggest worry was passing your exams.

875
01:32:04.101 --> 01:32:07.438
-Yes, it was then.
-I worry about you now.

876
01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:12.818
Oh, Mary, you're such a
warm-hearted girl. You always were.

877
01:32:13.485 --> 01:32:16.780
-I love my family.
-Even your cousin Vincent?

878
01:32:21.035 --> 01:32:22.911
I really love him.

879
01:32:24.496 --> 01:32:27.458
-He's your first cousin.
-Then I love him first.

880
01:32:28.584 --> 01:32:31.295
Mary, you can't see him.

881
01:32:32.087 --> 01:32:34.381
Just don't see him anymore.

882
01:32:35.382 --> 01:32:38.552
He's right. It's too dangerous.

883
01:32:40.971 --> 01:32:43.932
Mary, you can't see him anymore.

884
01:32:44.475 --> 01:32:46.477
-Not in that fashion.
-No.

885
01:32:48.353 --> 01:32:51.607
-Please, promise me.
-No!

886
01:32:52.024 --> 01:32:54.109
-Obey me on this.
-No, Dad!

887
01:32:59.573 --> 01:33:03.577
Mary is smart, Dad.
She'll understand eventually.

888
01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:29.353
<i>Bella cugina... Tesoro mio.</i>

889
01:33:40.823 --> 01:33:43.200
-You wanted to see me?
-Yeah.

890
01:33:44.159 --> 01:33:47.496
I want you to do something for me.
It's dangerous.

891
01:33:49.289 --> 01:33:52.584
Good. I'm in. What do you need?

892
01:33:53.377 --> 01:33:56.505
I want you to sell your soul
to Don Altobello.

893
01:33:57.214 --> 01:33:58.799
To betray me.

894
01:34:02.302 --> 01:34:04.263
He'd never believe me.

895
01:34:05.389 --> 01:34:07.599
-That depends.
-Sit down.

896
01:34:10.477 --> 01:34:12.146
I have an idea.

897
01:34:13.814 --> 01:34:17.317
See if you can learn
how high Altobello is connected.

898
01:34:21.655 --> 01:34:23.365
Arrange a meeting.

899
01:34:25.951 --> 01:34:30.497
You say how devoted you are to me.
Tell him your problems.

900
01:34:31.665 --> 01:34:34.626
-Ask for his help.
-What problems?

901
01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:39.506
That you want to run away
with my daughter.

902
01:34:40.257 --> 01:34:43.677
But you know that if you do,
I will become your enemy.

903
01:34:48.932 --> 01:34:52.311
-You know that I would never do that.
-I know.

904
01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:58.025
<i>Ask Altobello to speak to me.
To further the marriage.</i>

905
01:34:58.734 --> 01:35:03.572
But you're cousins, after all. Michael
was always a little old-fashioned.

906
01:35:04.823 --> 01:35:09.661
Say you can't belong to my legitimate
world. That you want your own family.

907
01:35:10.662 --> 01:35:13.790
I could straighten out
what Joey Zasa left behind.

908
01:35:15.542 --> 01:35:18.503
If you could use your friendship
to persuade him,

909
01:35:19.546 --> 01:35:22.424
I would be indebted to you forever.

910
01:35:24.384 --> 01:35:27.930
A Corleone knows the value
of such a friend.

911
01:35:29.681 --> 01:35:32.226
Then you would work for me?

912
01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.311
<i>Sì.</i>

913
01:35:36.939 --> 01:35:39.524
<i>Bacio la mano, Don Altobello.</i>

914
01:35:42.611 --> 01:35:47.658
If he hints that he wants you
to betray me, get insulted,

915
01:35:48.408 --> 01:35:50.494
because that's his trap.

916
01:35:57.125 --> 01:36:00.337
You're not telling me
the whole truth, Vincenzo.

917
01:36:03.632 --> 01:36:09.221
Isn't it true, that with Michael gone,
the girl controls everything?

918
01:36:13.558 --> 01:36:17.271
-Leave the girl out of this.
-Of course, you love her.

919
01:36:17.354 --> 01:36:19.022
And she loves you.

920
01:36:39.584 --> 01:36:42.754
I guessed it, didn't I?

921
01:36:44.381 --> 01:36:49.177
You're a wise man, Don Altobello.
I'll be learning a lot from you.

922
01:36:50.262 --> 01:36:53.890
The richest man is the one
with the most powerful friends.

923
01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:59.021
It's my duty
to make the introductions.

924
01:37:05.861 --> 01:37:07.988
Don Lucchesi.

925
01:37:10.574 --> 01:37:16.204
Don Altobello tells me that you have
a strong character. A man of respect.

926
01:37:16.288 --> 01:37:19.499
This is the hero who put
Joey Zasa in his grave.

927
01:37:20.167 --> 01:37:24.004
If we'd known of his existence,
we wouldn't have backed Joey.

928
01:37:24.504 --> 01:37:26.590
No one wants another Joe.

929
01:37:28.508 --> 01:37:30.677
Let me be your friend.

930
01:37:31.303 --> 01:37:35.474
-Even the strongest man needs friends.
-I'm flattered.

931
01:37:36.725 --> 01:37:41.396
You're a man of finance and politics.
Things I don't understand.

932
01:37:43.065 --> 01:37:46.985
You understand guns.
Finance is a gun.

933
01:37:48.195 --> 01:37:52.491
Politics is knowing
when to pull the trigger.

934
01:37:56.912 --> 01:37:58.288
How can I help?

935
01:37:59.373 --> 01:38:00.582
<i>Vieni?</i>

936
01:38:03.668 --> 01:38:09.007
Blessed is the peacemaker,
for he can be called the child of God.

937
01:38:09.466 --> 01:38:12.219
<i>-Tu parli Italiano un poco?
-Sì.</i>

938
01:38:34.658 --> 01:38:37.452
The wheelchair, for Don Tommasino.

939
01:38:45.335 --> 01:38:50.132
I trusted this business arrangement
with the Archbishop. I trusted him.

940
01:38:50.215 --> 01:38:53.427
I was sure his honesty
was beyond a doubt.

941
01:38:54.428 --> 01:38:58.723
But, as you see,
I'm now the victim of a swindle.

942
01:38:59.474 --> 01:39:01.476
He's stalling me.

943
01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:05.564
Vast monies have gone to
people in high political places

944
01:39:05.647 --> 01:39:08.608
and the Vatican Bank is the guarantor.

945
01:39:08.692 --> 01:39:13.697
If what you say is true,
there will be a great scandal.

946
01:39:15.907 --> 01:39:20.954
Look at this stone. It has been
in the water for a very long time,

947
01:39:21.037 --> 01:39:24.749
but the water has not penetrated it.

948
01:39:29.004 --> 01:39:30.380
Look...

949
01:39:31.506 --> 01:39:36.678
Perfectly dry. The same thing
has happened to men in Europe.

950
01:39:36.761 --> 01:39:40.682
For centuries they have been
surrounded by Christianity,

951
01:39:41.725 --> 01:39:47.564
but Christ has not penetrated.
Christ doesn't live within them.

952
01:39:51.693 --> 01:39:55.697
-What's happening?
-Could you get me something sweet?

953
01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:59.201
Some orange juice, candy...

954
01:40:02.871 --> 01:40:05.207
I have trouble with diabetes.

955
01:40:08.835 --> 01:40:11.254
My blood sugar goes low.

956
01:40:11.338 --> 01:40:13.089
I understand.

957
01:40:36.446 --> 01:40:39.324
It happens sometimes
when I'm under stress.

958
01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:41.701
I understand.

959
01:40:43.828 --> 01:40:47.707
To come to you
on such a delicate matter...

960
01:40:50.585 --> 01:40:55.006
Accusations against your Archbishop.
It was difficult for me.

961
01:40:56.716 --> 01:40:58.635
The mind suffers

962
01:40:59.010 --> 01:41:01.763
and the body cries out.

963
01:41:07.936 --> 01:41:09.604
That's true.

964
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:14.901
Would you like to make
your confession?

965
01:41:21.866 --> 01:41:23.702
Your Eminence, I'm...

966
01:41:27.872 --> 01:41:33.378
It's been so long. I wouldn't...
I wouldn't know where to...

967
01:41:34.838 --> 01:41:36.673
It's been 30 years.

968
01:41:38.758 --> 01:41:41.386
I'd use up too much of your time,
I think.

969
01:41:42.304 --> 01:41:44.806
I always have time to save souls.

970
01:41:46.516 --> 01:41:51.062
-Well, I'm beyond redemption.
-No, no...

971
01:42:00.488 --> 01:42:04.159
I hear the confessions
of my own priests here.

972
01:42:05.577 --> 01:42:08.997
Sometimes the desire to confess
is overwhelming,

973
01:42:09.873 --> 01:42:12.083
and we must seize the moment.

974
01:42:16.921 --> 01:42:20.508
What is the point of confessing
if I don't repent?

975
01:42:22.969 --> 01:42:25.472
I hear you are a practical man.

976
01:42:26.389 --> 01:42:28.475
What have you got to lose?

977
01:42:40.278 --> 01:42:41.738
Go on.

978
01:42:48.453 --> 01:42:49.663
I...

979
01:42:50.955 --> 01:42:52.957
...betrayed my wife.

980
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:56.169
Go on, my son.

981
01:43:01.758 --> 01:43:03.718
I betrayed myself.

982
01:43:06.763 --> 01:43:08.181
I killed men.

983
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:14.854
And I ordered men to be killed.

984
01:43:16.272 --> 01:43:18.358
Go on, my son. Go on.

985
01:43:24.239 --> 01:43:25.699
It's useless.

986
01:43:27.742 --> 01:43:29.327
Go on, my son.

987
01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:32.205
I killed...

988
01:43:37.335 --> 01:43:39.963
I ordered the death of my brother.

989
01:43:40.922 --> 01:43:42.882
He injured me.

990
01:43:44.426 --> 01:43:46.511
I killed my mother's son.

991
01:43:48.304 --> 01:43:50.390
I killed my father's son.

992
01:44:01.067 --> 01:44:05.572
Your sins are terrible,
and it is just that you suffer.

993
01:44:07.073 --> 01:44:09.576
Your life could be redeemed,

994
01:44:10.827 --> 01:44:14.873
but I know that you don't
believe that. You will not change.

995
01:44:38.438 --> 01:44:43.318
<i>Pope Paul VI, Supreme Pontiff
of the Roman Catholic Church.</i>

996
01:44:43.485 --> 01:44:46.946
<i>died last night at 9:40 p.m.</i>

997
01:44:47.655 --> 01:44:50.867
<i>The Pope was 81 years old,</i>

998
01:44:51.618 --> 01:44:57.290
<i>and had been in poor health
for the last several months.</i>

999
01:45:06.883 --> 01:45:08.343
Connie...

1000
01:45:10.136 --> 01:45:14.641
All my life I've kept trying
to go up in society.

1001
01:45:15.266 --> 01:45:18.144
To where everything higher up
was legal, straight...

1002
01:45:20.271 --> 01:45:23.858
But the higher I go,
the more crooked it becomes.

1003
01:45:26.569 --> 01:45:28.780
Where the hell does it end?

1004
01:45:37.789 --> 01:45:41.084
They've been killing each other
for centuries here.

1005
01:45:42.627 --> 01:45:46.714
For money, for pride, for family.

1006
01:45:49.968 --> 01:45:53.972
To keep from becoming the slaves
of the rich <i>pezzi da novanta.</i>

1007
01:46:01.104 --> 01:46:03.147
I made confession, Connie.

1008
01:46:04.148 --> 01:46:06.234
I confessed my sins.

1009
01:46:08.069 --> 01:46:10.530
Why? That's not like you.

1010
01:46:10.613 --> 01:46:13.408
You don't have to confess your sins
to a stranger.

1011
01:46:14.075 --> 01:46:15.535
It was the man.

1012
01:46:16.578 --> 01:46:20.206
He's a good man. A true priest.

1013
01:46:24.419 --> 01:46:26.504
He can change things.

1014
01:46:28.798 --> 01:46:30.466
Michael...

1015
01:46:32.051 --> 01:46:35.930
You know,
sometimes I think of poor Fredo.

1016
01:46:36.723 --> 01:46:40.059
Drowned. It was God's will.

1017
01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:44.772
It was a terrible accident.

1018
01:46:46.065 --> 01:46:47.984
But it's finished.

1019
01:46:53.031 --> 01:46:55.074
Michael, I love you.

1020
01:46:57.327 --> 01:46:59.245
I'll always help you.

1021
01:47:11.591 --> 01:47:13.009
Oh, Connie...

1022
01:47:43.164 --> 01:47:50.171
I am honored, Don Altobello, that
you've come from Palermo to visit me.

1023
01:47:53.341 --> 01:47:58.346
Hey, the little kid! He's grown.

1024
01:47:59.097 --> 01:48:00.890
Do the donkey for me.

1025
01:48:18.366 --> 01:48:22.453
It's been some time since we
did business together.

1026
01:48:26.416 --> 01:48:31.421
You are my "ace in the hole,”
as we say in America.

1027
01:48:31.504 --> 01:48:37.343
I have a stone in my shoe.
You can remove it.

1028
01:48:44.684 --> 01:48:47.562
Only one stone?

1029
01:48:49.605 --> 01:48:55.528
It's dangerous. A famous man.

1030
01:48:55.611 --> 01:48:58.948
You will have to take precautions.

1031
01:49:02.243 --> 01:49:07.582
Tell me what to do.
Then I will tell you my price.

1032
01:49:11.878 --> 01:49:14.589
Ah, what bread!

1033
01:49:18.634 --> 01:49:22.805
Olive oil...

1034
01:49:26.059 --> 01:49:29.395
Virgin... only in Sicily.

1035
01:49:31.898 --> 01:49:33.232
<i>Alla salute!</i>

1036
01:49:33.316 --> 01:49:36.402
To death.

1037
01:49:49.665 --> 01:49:51.167
Kay!

1038
01:49:51.250 --> 01:49:53.669
-Connie!
-How are you?

1039
01:49:53.753 --> 01:49:56.839
Mary, I've missed you.

1040
01:49:57.256 --> 01:50:01.135
-Hello, Michael.
-Mom, look at this.

1041
01:50:05.223 --> 01:50:07.642
It's too bad Douglas couldn't come.

1042
01:50:07.725 --> 01:50:11.145
I know.
He had a very important trial.

1043
01:50:11.229 --> 01:50:13.272
I know he wanted to come.

1044
01:50:14.232 --> 01:50:16.275
-The car is...
-Okay.

1045
01:50:18.236 --> 01:50:24.450
-Well, your son is an artist.
-Oh, yes. Thanks to you.

1046
01:50:25.284 --> 01:50:29.455
-What for?
-For making me let him go.

1047
01:50:30.331 --> 01:50:35.169
Well, after all these years, here I am
in Sicily for the first time.

1048
01:50:35.253 --> 01:50:37.463
I want to get
a picture of you together.

1049
01:50:37.547 --> 01:50:38.673
Okay.

1050
01:50:40.383 --> 01:50:42.343
Hey, Dad. Smile!

1051
01:50:46.722 --> 01:50:49.559
I see you still have Al Neri. Why?

1052
01:50:50.893 --> 01:50:54.397
I need him. He helps me
get in and out of the car.

1053
01:50:55.606 --> 01:50:59.277
-He carries my briefcase.
-You're still a liar, Michael.

1054
01:51:00.611 --> 01:51:03.948
Let me show you Sicily,
the real Sicily.

1055
01:51:04.031 --> 01:51:06.951
So you'll understand
the family history.

1056
01:51:07.034 --> 01:51:09.829
I think I understand it well enough.

1057
01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:07.303
Anthony, I have something you made
for me a very long time ago.

1058
01:52:09.222 --> 01:52:11.933
-Might bring you luck.
-Thanks.

1059
01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:19.273
You saved it... I remember.

1060
01:52:23.277 --> 01:52:24.987
Thank you, Dad.

1061
01:52:26.489 --> 01:52:28.449
I'm proud of you.

1062
01:52:29.116 --> 01:52:30.534
Thank you.

1063
01:52:46.926 --> 01:52:49.762
-Are they as good as they look?
-Better.

1064
01:52:49.845 --> 01:52:54.392
They're the best. As long as they are
around, Uncle Michael is safe.

1065
01:52:54.892 --> 01:52:56.394
Goodbye.

1066
01:52:58.854 --> 01:53:00.982
Tell your father
I'll be back for dinner.

1067
01:53:01.065 --> 01:53:02.066
Okay.

1068
01:53:02.775 --> 01:53:05.319
-Have fun.
-Tell Tony to wait for me.

1069
01:53:05.403 --> 01:53:06.988
I will.

1070
01:53:09.365 --> 01:53:13.119
Buongiorno, signora. At your service.

1071
01:53:17.081 --> 01:53:19.917
If I see Dad, I'll tell him you left.

1072
01:53:25.548 --> 01:53:29.135
You're the only one left
with my father's strength.

1073
01:53:31.429 --> 01:53:35.308
If anything happens to Michael,
I want you to strike back.

1074
01:53:38.227 --> 01:53:40.229
I'll have everything ready.

1075
01:53:43.566 --> 01:53:44.608
Do you swear?

1076
01:53:52.783 --> 01:53:54.535
I swear to you.

1077
01:54:24.815 --> 01:54:26.400
Here it is.

1078
01:54:28.402 --> 01:54:30.946
The house where my father was born.

1079
01:54:32.031 --> 01:54:37.536
This is where they came to take him
when he was a boy. To kill him.

1080
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:42.458
Wait...

1081
01:54:43.125 --> 01:54:45.002
Listen to that.

1082
01:55:04.230 --> 01:55:06.232
You know Mary's in love.

1083
01:55:07.608 --> 01:55:09.402
Yes, I know.

1084
01:55:10.403 --> 01:55:14.448
With a handsome young Italian man
With dark eyes...

1085
01:55:15.783 --> 01:55:17.576
I won't allow it.

1086
01:55:20.579 --> 01:55:24.291
It's wrong.
It's wrong and it's dangerous.

1087
01:55:24.792 --> 01:55:27.586
"Oh father, my father!"

1088
01:55:28.045 --> 01:55:30.548
"Give me some time to pray
to the Lord."

1089
01:55:31.590 --> 01:55:34.427
The Baroness of Carini had
betrayed her husband...

1090
01:55:35.177 --> 01:55:37.888
and fallen in love with her cousin.

1091
01:55:38.347 --> 01:55:40.391
"There will be no forgiveness!"

1092
01:55:40.474 --> 01:55:43.936
Her father stabbed her through
the heart.

1093
01:55:56.615 --> 01:55:57.950
Honor, huh?

1094
01:56:17.511 --> 01:56:20.514
I remember the time you came
to my parents' house

1095
01:56:20.598 --> 01:56:24.351
and told me about the family business.

1096
01:56:24.435 --> 01:56:29.440
How you'd never have anything
to do with it. You sounded like Tony.

1097
01:56:30.524 --> 01:56:32.526
I was a lot like Tony.

1098
01:56:40.034 --> 01:56:42.870
-I can barely see him... Kay?
-What?

1099
01:56:42.953 --> 01:56:45.581
-Do you mind driving?
-What's wrong?

1100
01:56:45.664 --> 01:56:48.626
My eyes.
Sometimes they're all right, but...

1101
01:56:50.544 --> 01:56:52.713
I have to see Don Tommasino...

1102
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:57.843
Well...

1103
01:56:59.136 --> 01:57:02.640
-There are no bodyguards today.
-I really snuck away.

1104
01:57:09.688 --> 01:57:14.193
Father, where are you going?
Would you like a ride?

1105
01:57:23.494 --> 01:57:27.790
I know you. You're Mosca
of Montelepre.

1106
01:57:28.749 --> 01:57:32.545
You were an assassin then
and you're an assassin now.

1107
01:57:32.878 --> 01:57:36.298
I know Michael Corleone
is at your house.

1108
01:57:36.507 --> 01:57:38.551
I will pass through the gates
with you.

1109
01:57:55.776 --> 01:57:57.528
How are you?

1110
01:57:57.611 --> 01:58:01.115
This is Calo, one of my bodyguards
in the old days.

1111
01:58:06.870 --> 01:58:09.623
-We can wait here.
-You want a drink?

1112
01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:17.756
I spent a lot of time in this room...

1113
01:58:18.882 --> 01:58:20.926
...thinking of you.

1114
01:58:23.929 --> 01:58:26.140
And then you got married.

1115
01:58:29.602 --> 01:58:33.105
-I still thought of you.
-What's in that room?

1116
01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:41.530
This is dangerous for you.
This is Sicily.

1117
01:58:44.658 --> 01:58:46.910
-I love this country.
-Why?

1118
01:58:49.580 --> 01:58:52.791
Well, all through history,

1119
01:58:52.875 --> 01:58:55.586
terrible things
have happened to these people.

1120
01:58:56.545 --> 01:58:58.839
Terrible injustices.

1121
01:58:59.673 --> 01:59:04.511
But they still expect good,
rather than bad, will happen to them.

1122
01:59:04.970 --> 01:59:07.389
Sort of like me and you?

1123
01:59:11.226 --> 01:59:13.812
-How so?
-I'm still here, right?

1124
01:59:14.772 --> 01:59:16.190
We do have a bad history,

1125
01:59:16.774 --> 01:59:17.858
but I'm still here.

1126
01:59:17.941 --> 01:59:20.736
Yes, you are, but with dread.

1127
01:59:25.616 --> 01:59:27.326
Give me the order!

1128
01:59:27.493 --> 01:59:30.245
Is that supposed to make me
not dread you?

1129
01:59:33.207 --> 01:59:35.501
We're in Sicily. It's opera.

1130
01:59:38.003 --> 01:59:39.546
Okay.

1131
01:59:42.091 --> 01:59:43.801
What do we do now?

1132
01:59:46.720 --> 01:59:50.557
Be reasonable.
Let's try not to hurt each other.

1133
01:59:58.399 --> 02:00:00.442
I want you to forgive me.

1134
02:00:03.195 --> 02:00:06.115
-For what?
-Everything.

1135
02:00:09.743 --> 02:00:11.912
Oh, like God?

1136
02:00:13.747 --> 02:00:16.542
No, I need something a little closer.

1137
02:00:19.420 --> 02:00:22.631
You couldn't understand,
back in those days.

1138
02:00:23.966 --> 02:00:28.846
I loved my father. I swore I would
never be a man like him,

1139
02:00:28.929 --> 02:00:32.933
but I loved him and he was in danger.
What could I do?

1140
02:00:33.517 --> 02:00:36.186
And then later, you were in danger.

1141
02:00:37.062 --> 02:00:40.482
Our children were in danger.
What could I do?

1142
02:00:41.525 --> 02:00:46.822
You were all that I... loved
and valued most in the world.

1143
02:00:49.116 --> 02:00:51.827
Now I'm losing you. I lost you.

1144
02:00:52.536 --> 02:00:54.329
You're gone.

1145
02:00:55.622 --> 02:00:58.375
And it was all for nothing. So...

1146
02:01:03.005 --> 02:01:08.051
You have to understand, I had
a whole different destiny planned.

1147
02:01:11.805 --> 02:01:13.640
All right, I'll stop.

1148
02:01:24.026 --> 02:01:27.946
I really don't know what you
want from me, Michael.

1149
02:01:28.530 --> 02:01:32.743
-I mean...
-I'm not the man that you think I am.

1150
02:01:34.495 --> 02:01:37.915
-I don't know.
-I love you, Kay.

1151
02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:41.919
Don't dread me anymore.

1152
02:01:47.633 --> 02:01:51.512
You know,
every night here in Sicily...

1153
02:01:53.722 --> 02:01:58.685
...I dream about my wife
and my children...

1154
02:02:02.064 --> 02:02:04.024
...and how I lost them.

1155
02:02:06.318 --> 02:02:11.949
I guess that if it's any consolation,
I want you to know that...

1156
02:02:15.536 --> 02:02:16.829
...that...

1157
02:02:17.913 --> 02:02:20.332
...I always loved you, Michael.

1158
02:02:21.959 --> 02:02:23.627
And you know...

1159
02:02:25.420 --> 02:02:27.881
...always, I always will.

1160
02:02:56.368 --> 02:02:58.787
What is it? What's wrong?

1161
02:02:59.079 --> 02:03:01.832
They found Don Tommasino shot.

1162
02:03:02.958 --> 02:03:05.252
Is he dead?

1163
02:03:07.129 --> 02:03:10.799
My master is dead.
Blood calls for blood.

1164
02:03:11.133 --> 02:03:13.927
I must have revenge!

1165
02:03:17.931 --> 02:03:22.936
Some day, you may have to do
a difficult service for me.

1166
02:03:23.228 --> 02:03:24.938
Command me.

1167
02:03:26.815 --> 02:03:27.983
It never ends.

1168
02:03:28.066 --> 02:03:30.068
I will avenge him!

1169
02:03:45.292 --> 02:03:46.877
Totals...

1170
02:03:48.879 --> 02:03:51.089
Lorscheider, 1 vote.

1171
02:03:51.924 --> 02:03:54.968

Lamberto, 99 votes.

1173
02:04:04.019 --> 02:04:09.441
Do you accept your election
as supreme pontiff?

1174
02:04:09.983 --> 02:04:15.948
Oh God, shed light on the decision
they have taken on my behalf.

1175
02:04:16.782 --> 02:04:18.408
I accept.

1176
02:04:18.617 --> 02:04:21.161
By what name do you
wish to be called?

1177
02:04:21.536 --> 02:04:24.539
John Paul the First.

1178
02:04:54.486 --> 02:04:59.324
I will do things "right away,"
rather than in "a little while"...

1179
02:05:00.784 --> 02:05:04.913
<i>Frederick Keinszig, known as "God's
Banker", has been reported missing.</i>

1180
02:05:06.540 --> 02:05:10.460
<i>He was last seen leaving the Rome
offices of Vatican owned Immobiliare.</i>

1181
02:05:14.256 --> 02:05:17.843
<i>Also missing was a large sum
of money and several documents.</i>

1182
02:05:18.969 --> 02:05:21.054
Keinszig, you fool.

1183
02:05:24.725 --> 02:05:29.604
<i>His absence casts further suspicion
on the dealings of the Vatican Bank.</i>

1184
02:05:29.688 --> 02:05:32.357
<i>For several years,
the bank and its companies</i>

1185
02:05:32.441 --> 02:05:36.778
<i>have been the object or allegations
of disreputable business practices.</i>

1186
02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:42.200
Lucchesi, will you please
try to understand?

1187
02:05:43.535 --> 02:05:47.831
I have phoned him.
I have waited here by the phone.

1188
02:05:50.375 --> 02:05:54.046
You would do well to remember,
Mr. Lucchesi,

1189
02:05:55.589 --> 02:06:01.470
that this Pope has very different
ideas from the last one.

1190
02:06:23.742 --> 02:06:25.786
Goodbye, my old friend.

1191
02:06:28.413 --> 02:06:31.083
You could have lived a little longer.

1192
02:06:32.209 --> 02:06:34.586
[ Could be closer to my dream.

1193
02:06:41.009 --> 02:06:43.428
You were so loved, Don Tommasino.

1194
02:06:48.225 --> 02:06:52.104
Why was I so feared, and you so loved?

1195
02:06:53.146 --> 02:06:54.898
What was it?

1196
02:06:56.149 --> 02:06:58.151
I was no less honorable.

1197
02:07:00.278 --> 02:07:02.072
I wanted to do good.

1198
02:07:06.243 --> 02:07:09.162
What betrayed me? My mind? My heart?

1199
02:07:12.249 --> 02:07:14.793
Why do I condemn myself so?

1200
02:07:21.258 --> 02:07:23.176
I swear,

1201
02:07:23.468 --> 02:07:25.804
on the lives of my children...

1202
02:07:30.225 --> 02:07:33.061
Give me a chance to redeem myself...

1203
02:07:37.023 --> 02:07:40.569
...and I will sin no more.

1204
02:08:04.843 --> 02:08:08.722
You look pale. Bad news?
Tell me right away.

1205
02:08:10.891 --> 02:08:13.226
It's not just a bad banking deal.

1206
02:08:14.269 --> 02:08:16.396
These guys are butchers.

1207
02:08:17.647 --> 02:08:20.233
-What guys?
-Lucchesi.

1208
02:08:22.277 --> 02:08:26.114
He controls all of them:
Altobello, the Archbishop...

1209
02:08:27.866 --> 02:08:30.452
...others higher up, P2 maybe.

1210
02:08:30.535 --> 02:08:33.622
Secret unknown.
They're running things.

1211
02:08:37.334 --> 02:08:42.339
-I'm in their way.
-He's hired an assassin to kill you.

1212
02:08:42.881 --> 02:08:45.425
A Sicilian. I don't know his name.

1213
02:08:47.594 --> 02:08:49.804
But they say he never fails.

1214
02:08:51.139 --> 02:08:53.308
Then no one is safe.

1215
02:08:56.102 --> 02:08:58.313
Even the new Pope is in danger.

1216
02:08:59.397 --> 02:09:02.525
We still have time.
We can prevent this.

1217
02:09:08.031 --> 02:09:10.200
I tried, Vincent.

1218
02:09:12.410 --> 02:09:14.037
I tried...

1219
02:09:15.205 --> 02:09:19.751
...to keep everything from coming
to this. But it's not possible.

1220
02:09:21.419 --> 02:09:23.129
Not in this world.

1221
02:09:24.631 --> 02:09:26.299
Give me the order.

1222
02:09:30.387 --> 02:09:32.555
You won't be able to go back.

1223
02:09:33.598 --> 02:09:35.725
-You'll be like me.
-Good.

1224
02:09:37.435 --> 02:09:39.479
All my life I wanted out.

1225
02:09:40.355 --> 02:09:42.399
I wanted the family out.

1226
02:09:44.317 --> 02:09:46.236
I don't want out.

1227
02:09:46.695 --> 02:09:49.406
I want the power
to preserve the family.

1228
02:09:54.286 --> 02:09:56.329
I'm asking for the order.

1229
02:10:17.267 --> 02:10:19.060
It's done.

1230
02:10:20.395 --> 02:10:22.772
Because I can't do it anymore.

1231
02:10:27.068 --> 02:10:30.572
Well, it doesn't matter.
Vincent knows what to do.

1232
02:10:30.655 --> 02:10:35.660
Come on outside.
Take a rest and don't think about it.

1233
02:10:36.119 --> 02:10:38.997
-All I do is think about it.
-I'm your son.

1234
02:10:40.206 --> 02:10:42.375
Command me in all things.

1235
02:10:44.544 --> 02:10:46.421
Give up my daughter.

1236
02:10:49.507 --> 02:10:51.718
That's the price you pay...

1237
02:10:52.886 --> 02:10:55.055
...for the life you choose.

1238
02:11:21.331 --> 02:11:22.791
Nephew...

1239
02:11:25.335 --> 02:11:27.420
...from this moment on...

1240
02:11:28.671 --> 02:11:31.299
...call yourself Vincent Corleone.

1241
02:11:36.054 --> 02:11:37.347
Sit.

1242
02:11:52.362 --> 02:11:54.114
Don Vincenzo...

1243
02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:01.746
Don Corleone...

1244
02:12:05.375 --> 02:12:07.544
Don Vincenzo Corleone...

1245
02:13:41.262 --> 02:13:43.473
<i>E tu, Vincenzo...</i>

1246
02:13:43.556 --> 02:13:48.353
I know how you feel about Michael,
but you can't save him.

1247
02:13:49.229 --> 02:13:50.480
He's lost.

1248
02:13:52.106 --> 02:13:53.942
Think of yourself.

1249
02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:57.779
What's your answer, Vincent?

1250
02:13:59.405 --> 02:14:01.115
Enjoy the opera.

1251
02:14:03.201 --> 02:14:05.245
It's all taken care of.

1252
02:14:10.750 --> 02:14:13.503
Check the bar.
I'll check the top floor.

1253
02:14:17.173 --> 02:14:21.761
"Here's hoping Tony sings better at
the Teatro Massimo than in the shower.

1254
02:14:21.844 --> 02:14:24.180
"Love, Douglas."

1255
02:14:24.264 --> 02:14:27.517
-My darling Constanza!
-Don Altobello.

1256
02:14:28.643 --> 02:14:31.688
-This is a great occasion.
-Come, sit down.

1257
02:14:36.276 --> 02:14:40.572
Happy birthday. You're 80,
but don't look more than 60.

1258
02:14:40.655 --> 02:14:43.283
You're the only one who remembered.

1259
02:14:43.366 --> 02:14:44.993
We've just got the word.

1260
02:14:45.076 --> 02:14:48.621
The Pope has ratified
the Immobiliare deal. We've won.

1261
02:14:48.705 --> 02:14:50.331
Congratulations.

1262
02:14:53.126 --> 02:14:55.461
Strange how things work.

1263
02:14:55.545 --> 02:14:59.632
The Pope is doing what you
said he'd do. He's cleaning house.

1264
02:15:00.508 --> 02:15:04.512
He should be careful.
It's dangerous to be an honest man.

1265
02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:13.688
I want to put more muscle backstage
with Tony.

1266
02:15:25.742 --> 02:15:29.078
On your birthday you used to
shower me with treats.

1267
02:15:29.162 --> 02:15:30.997
Tootsie Rolls!

1268
02:15:31.831 --> 02:15:35.376
The nuns who made this cannoli
took a vow of silence.

1269
02:15:35.460 --> 02:15:37.337
They're the very finest.

1270
02:15:41.215 --> 02:15:43.926
-Hey.
-Hey, cous.

1271
02:15:45.970 --> 02:15:48.681
Hi. Where's your leather?

1272
02:15:52.894 --> 02:15:54.562
Stop it.

1273
02:16:00.526 --> 02:16:03.780
You're so thin. You eat it.

1274
02:16:20.380 --> 02:16:21.798
<i>È buoro.</i>

1275
02:16:22.215 --> 02:16:24.550
Grazie!

1276
02:16:27.470 --> 02:16:31.808
It's over. There are things I have
to do that you can't be part of.

1277
02:16:31.891 --> 02:16:35.019
It's not your father's decision,
it's mine.

1278
02:16:36.729 --> 02:16:38.606
Don't hate your father.

1279
02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:44.696
There are things I'll be part of
that you can't be around.

1280
02:16:46.656 --> 02:16:49.325
After tonight,
you won't see me anymore.

1281
02:16:53.788 --> 02:16:57.333
You've got to understand, Mary.
You've got to understand.

1282
02:16:58.376 --> 02:16:59.919
I'll always love you.

1283
02:17:13.182 --> 02:17:14.976
Love somebody else.

1284
02:20:56.113 --> 02:21:00.076
-They won't try anything.
-Everything's fine. It's all clear.

1285
02:21:00.159 --> 02:21:02.954
I've already sent Al Neri
to the Vatican.

1286
02:21:15.549 --> 02:21:18.010
Mr. Lucchesi's house?

1287
02:21:18.094 --> 02:21:19.095
Yes.

1288
02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:23.975
I bring a message from
Michael Corleone.

1289
02:21:25.226 --> 02:21:26.727
Let him in.

1290
02:22:55.858 --> 02:22:57.735
<i>Buona sera.</i>

1291
02:26:18.727 --> 02:26:20.562
Good. You got him.

1292
02:27:12.865 --> 02:27:16.410
<i>Tonight the Corleone family
settles its accounts.</i>

1293
02:27:16.577 --> 02:27:21.248
<i>Reinszig...
That little Swiss banker fuck.</i>

1294
02:27:22.333 --> 02:27:26.295
<i>He's been swindling everyone
from the beginning. Fuck him.</i>

1295
02:27:28.047 --> 02:27:30.591
<i>Don Lucchesi, my friend.</i>

1296
02:27:30.674 --> 02:27:33.260
<i>Calo will pay him a visit at his home.</i>

1297
02:27:36.096 --> 02:27:39.391
<i>Neri take a train to Rome.</i>

1298
02:27:40.934 --> 02:27:43.395
<i>Light a candle for the Archbishop.</i>

1299
02:28:19.723 --> 02:28:21.892
Tea, Your Holiness? It will help
you sleep.

1300
02:28:45.040 --> 02:28:48.043
This is from Vincent Corleone.

1301
02:29:46.226 --> 02:29:47.853
It's serious.

1302
02:29:47.936 --> 02:29:51.398
Our man inside the Vatican
says there's a plot against the Pope.

1303
02:29:51.482 --> 02:29:53.525
He'll have a heart attack?

1304
02:30:00.491 --> 02:30:05.746
This Pope has powerful enemies.
We may not be in time to save him.

1305
02:30:08.707 --> 02:30:10.417
Let's go back.

1306
02:30:44.868 --> 02:30:46.411
<i>Eminenza...</i>

1307
02:31:02.261 --> 02:31:04.805
The Holy Father is dead!

1308
02:32:35.395 --> 02:32:36.730
Sleep.

1309
02:32:37.522 --> 02:32:39.483
Sleep, Godfather.

1310
02:32:54.998 --> 02:32:56.583
Our friend's dead.

1311
02:33:49.636 --> 02:33:51.722
Speak...tell me.

1312
02:33:53.014 --> 02:33:59.521
You have lost the
faith of the people.

1313
02:34:00.647 --> 02:34:05.277
He who builds on the people
builds on mud.

1314
02:34:05.819 --> 02:34:09.614
And Michael Corleone's message?

1315
02:34:26.214 --> 02:34:32.596
It's very important.
I must whisper it in your ear.

1316
02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:38.602
He's clean.

1317
02:34:56.953 --> 02:34:59.998
Power wears out those
who don't have it.

1318
02:36:28.545 --> 02:36:31.715
-I like this outfit.
-I figured you would.

1319
02:36:31.798 --> 02:36:33.675
Say hello.

1320
02:36:55.697 --> 02:36:59.618
-Can I talk to you now?
-No, it's not a good time.

1321
02:36:59.701 --> 02:37:03.413
-You're just like my father.
-Stay with the family. Go on.

1322
02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:06.958
-Talk to me.
-The twins are dead.

1323
02:37:07.042 --> 02:37:11.171
In about one minute, there will be
carabinieri all over this place.

1324
02:37:12.005 --> 02:37:14.883
Get everybody to the cars, quietly.

1325
02:37:14.966 --> 02:37:16.760
-Got it.
-Quiet.

1326
02:37:31.441 --> 02:37:34.611
The name Corleone
will be associated with a voice.

1327
02:37:44.329 --> 02:37:45.705
Dad...

1328
02:38:05.350 --> 02:38:09.104
Dad... Why are you doing this to me?

1329
02:38:18.363 --> 02:38:20.824
Move back, move back.

1330
02:38:22.283 --> 02:38:26.413
-You don't have to do this to me.
-Do what? What do you mean?

1331
02:38:52.772 --> 02:38:53.773
Dad...

1332
02:39:11.124 --> 02:39:13.084
No! Mary!

1333
02:39:16.421 --> 02:39:17.922
God, no!
