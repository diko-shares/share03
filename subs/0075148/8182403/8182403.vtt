1
00:01:12.355 --> 00:01:15.025
Referee, why don't you stop the fight?

2
00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:24.284
Let's go! Let's go!

3
00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:31.250
Come on! Get him!

4
00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:34.921
Come on! Hit him! Hit him!

5
00:01:58.403 --> 00:02:01.406
You're waltzing.
Give the sucker some action.

6
00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:04.909
You're fighting like a bum.
Want some advice?

7
00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:06.075
Water.

8
00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.078
Cold beer here!

9
00:02:09.914 --> 00:02:12.750
Should I bet the fight don't go
three rounds? You feel strong?

10
00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:15.252
- Absolutely.
- Cold beer!

11
00:02:15.336 --> 00:02:18.256
- You want some good advice?
- Mouthpiece.

12
00:02:29.473 --> 00:02:31.019
Come on, Rock!

13
00:03:39.961 --> 00:03:42.131
All right. All right.

14
00:03:42.548 --> 00:03:47.133
Next a six-rounder
between local lightweights Kid Brooks

15
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.013
and Sugar Johnson.

16
00:03:57.187 --> 00:03:58.895
Good going, champ.

17
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.318
- Hey.
- Say what?

18
00:04:02.401 --> 00:04:05.485
- You got a smoke?
- Yeah, you can have this one.

19
00:04:06.406 --> 00:04:07.907
You're a bum.

20
00:04:08.324 --> 00:04:11.157
You're a bum, you know that?
You're a bum!

21
00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:42.064
You really got lucky tonight.

22
00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:43.692
Spider, here's loser's share.

23
00:04:43.776 --> 00:04:46.362
$40, less $15 locker and cornerman,

24
00:04:46.446 --> 00:04:49.281
$5 shower and towel, 7 percent tax.

25
00:04:49.365 --> 00:04:51.367
Comes to 17.20.

26
00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:53.870
You fought a good fight, Spider.

27
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:56.247
Balboa, you get winner's share, $65.

28
00:04:56.329 --> 00:05:01.209
Less $15 locker and cornerman,
$5 shower and towel and 7 percent tax.

29
00:05:01.293 --> 00:05:03.754
Comes to 40.55.

30
00:05:04.713 --> 00:05:07.507
- When do I fight again?
- Maybe two weeks.

31
00:05:07.716 --> 00:05:11.471
Give me a call. The doctor should be in
in about 20 minutes.

32
00:05:47.838 --> 00:05:49.425
Hey, boy.

33
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.733
You guys are getting better every year.
You know that?

34
00:06:48.358 --> 00:06:49.485
Yeah.

35
00:08:01.557 --> 00:08:04.560
Hey, your old man did pretty good tonight.

36
00:08:04.644 --> 00:08:06.478
Why weren't you there?

37
00:08:06.562 --> 00:08:09.273
You should've seen me. You guys hungry?

38
00:08:11.733 --> 00:08:13.194
Here you go.

39
00:08:14.403 --> 00:08:15.778
Here you go.

40
00:08:18.324 --> 00:08:21.076
You wanna see
your friend Moby Dick, huh?

41
00:08:24.372 --> 00:08:27.290
How you doing, Moby Dick?
You miss me today?

42
00:08:31.086 --> 00:08:32.588
Here you go. Say hi.

43
00:08:32.672 --> 00:08:36.341
If you guys could sing or dance,
I wouldn't be doing this.

44
00:08:53.274 --> 00:08:56.528
And this turtle food I got here, it's...

45
00:08:57.903 --> 00:08:59.907
This turtle food I got here
has more flies in it...

46
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.868
There are more moths in it than flies.

47
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:05.120
More flies... More moths...
Who the hell cares?

48
00:10:25.908 --> 00:10:28.576
How you feeling this morning? Full of life?

49
00:10:28.663 --> 00:10:30.038
Fine.

50
00:10:30.123 --> 00:10:32.041
How you doing, killer?

51
00:10:32.375 --> 00:10:35.086
- How's the turtle food this week?
- Fine.

52
00:10:36.043 --> 00:10:37.839
I'm kind of aggravated.

53
00:10:37.922 --> 00:10:39.129
Oh, I'm sorry.

54
00:10:39.215 --> 00:10:41.841
Ain't your fault.
You don't wanna hear about it?

55
00:10:41.926 --> 00:10:43.720
I'll tell you somebody
who don't wanna hear about it.

56
00:10:43.802 --> 00:10:45.763
- How you doing, Gloria?
- Good.

57
00:10:45.846 --> 00:10:50.018
The last turtle food I got here
had more moths in it than flies, Adrian.

58
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.894
These moths get caught
in the turtle's throat

59
00:10:51.975 --> 00:10:54.937
and they cough, and I gotta smack them
on the back of the shell

60
00:10:55.023 --> 00:10:56.899
and what do you think they get?

61
00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.524
They get what?

62
00:11:00.778 --> 00:11:02.864
Come on. Shell shock.

63
00:11:03.403 --> 00:11:04.907
They get shell-shocked.
What do you think?

64
00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:07.076
You're starting with
the bad jokes early, huh?

65
00:11:07.158 --> 00:11:09.701
Well, no.
Inventing jokes ain't so easy sometimes.

66
00:11:09.787 --> 00:11:11.663
No, that wasn't no joke.

67
00:11:11.748 --> 00:11:14.875
Hey, how's my buddy doing today?
Yo, Butkus.

68
00:11:14.956 --> 00:11:16.586
Yo, Butkus!

69
00:11:17.668 --> 00:11:19.047
What is it?

70
00:11:22.759 --> 00:11:25.219
Hey, give me a kiss.

71
00:11:25.302 --> 00:11:29.389
Adrian, go downstairs and clean
all the cat cages. They're a mess.

72
00:11:43.696 --> 00:11:46.532
You gotta pay for that turtle food,
rock head.

73
00:11:46.947 --> 00:11:49.869
Hey, crime don't pay.
You know that, Gloria.

74
00:12:14.432 --> 00:12:16.812
- Yo, Rock, how's your boss?
- Real good.

75
00:12:16.894 --> 00:12:18.855
Hey, Rock, you fighting again?

76
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.899
- Here and there.
- We'll make some money real soon, huh?

77
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.942
Yeah, a million dollars.

78
00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.778
Hey, you. Where are you going?

79
00:12:31.119 --> 00:12:33.870
Where are you going? Where you running?

80
00:12:34.413 --> 00:12:36.456
- Where you running?
- Hey! Hey!

81
00:12:36.541 --> 00:12:39.125
- Hey! Don't hit the face!
- Shut up!

82
00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:41.504
- Not the face!
- Mr. Gazzo wants the 200 now.

83
00:12:41.586 --> 00:12:42.797
I'm broke!

84
00:12:42.879 --> 00:12:46.048
Mr. Gazzo says I should get the 200
or break your thumb. You understand?

85
00:12:46.134 --> 00:12:48.970
- Please, don't...
- What's your name again?

86
00:12:49.802 --> 00:12:52.807
- Bob!
- Bob. Listen, Bob.

87
00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.519
You wanna dance, you gotta pay the band.
You understand?

88
00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.855
You wanna borrow,
you gotta pay the man.

89
00:12:58.937 --> 00:13:02.316
Hey, I ain't emotionally involved, Bob.
You understand?

90
00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:05.028
Give me some money.
Give me some money.

91
00:13:09.615 --> 00:13:11.240
There's 130 here.

92
00:13:11.325 --> 00:13:13.283
That's it. I'm broke.

93
00:13:13.369 --> 00:13:16.788
Hey, Bob, you're still $70 light.

94
00:13:17.288 --> 00:13:20.206
You don't have to break nothing.
Take my coat.

95
00:13:20.293 --> 00:13:22.336
It's worth $50, $60.

96
00:13:22.793 --> 00:13:24.464
Take the coat!

97
00:13:26.048 --> 00:13:27.548
You know, you should've planned ahead.

98
00:13:27.633 --> 00:13:29.759
You know that?
You should've planned ahead.

99
00:13:29.844 --> 00:13:32.177
We'll fake it. I'll tape up the hand
like you broke the thumb!

100
00:13:32.263 --> 00:13:34.849
- Should've planned ahead.
- Gazzo don't have to know!

101
00:13:34.932 --> 00:13:37.975
He won't be wise to nothing!
Gazzo won't be wise to nothing!

102
00:13:38.061 --> 00:13:40.855
Keep the coat! Keep the...

103
00:14:09.884 --> 00:14:14.013
He only had 130, but I think he's good
for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.

104
00:14:14.096 --> 00:14:16.389
Sure, Rocky. Bob's good for it.

105
00:14:17.642 --> 00:14:19.432
That's it for today.

106
00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:23.815
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio.
He's late three weeks. I don't like it.

107
00:14:23.898 --> 00:14:26.234
Tomorrow, three weeks. Del Rio?

108
00:14:26.649 --> 00:14:28.860
All right, I got it.
How do you spell Del Rio?

109
00:14:28.945 --> 00:14:31.239
- How'd you do last night?
- I did real good.

110
00:14:31.322 --> 00:14:32.740
- Hey.
- What?

111
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.658
- Did you get the license number?
- Of what?

112
00:14:35.743 --> 00:14:37.576
The truck that run over your face.

113
00:14:37.662 --> 00:14:39.745
Relax, Buddy. Pull it over here.

114
00:14:39.831 --> 00:14:43.292
I wanna let Rocky out.
I'm gonna talk to him for a few seconds.

115
00:15:06.105 --> 00:15:08.024
Why didn't you break this guy's thumb?

116
00:15:08.109 --> 00:15:10.403
- How do you know I didn't?
- You don't think I hear things?

117
00:15:10.485 --> 00:15:12.278
Didn't I give you a job this morning?

118
00:15:12.363 --> 00:15:15.240
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you break his thumb?

119
00:15:15.322 --> 00:15:19.162
When you don't do what I tell you to do,
you make me look bad.

120
00:15:19.326 --> 00:15:22.288
I figured... Look.
I figured if I break the guy's thumb,

121
00:15:22.373 --> 00:15:23.706
he gets laid off.

122
00:15:23.791 --> 00:15:26.668
- He can't make money.
- Let me do the figuring.

123
00:15:26.753 --> 00:15:29.129
From here on in, let me do the figuring.

124
00:15:29.211 --> 00:15:33.259
These guys think we're running a charity,
they'll get off light.

125
00:15:33.341 --> 00:15:35.845
From here on in, do what I tell you to do,

126
00:15:35.927 --> 00:15:37.427
because it's bad for my reputation.

127
00:15:37.513 --> 00:15:40.264
You understand? You got it, Rock?

128
00:15:41.307 --> 00:15:42.600
I got it.

129
00:15:45.437 --> 00:15:47.480
How do you spell Del Rio?

130
00:15:47.815 --> 00:15:50.317
- Look it up in a dictionary.
- Come on!

131
00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:53.571
I won't let that happen no more,
about the thumb.

132
00:15:55.447 --> 00:15:56.740
You know?

133
00:15:57.865 --> 00:15:59.576
So long, meat bag.

134
00:16:02.413 --> 00:16:04.666
I should've broke your thumbs!

135
00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.489
Hey, Rock. Heard you did good last night.

136
00:16:36.572 --> 00:16:39.615
- Absolutely. Should've seen me.
- Shouldn't you take a rest?

137
00:16:39.701 --> 00:16:41.576
- No, my back is hurt.
- Your back?

138
00:16:41.658 --> 00:16:43.745
My back is hurt. You deaf?

139
00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:45.373
No, I'm short.

140
00:17:49.979 --> 00:17:51.519
Hey, yo, Mike.

141
00:17:51.894 --> 00:17:54.567
Where's my lock?
Whose stuff is this in my locker?

142
00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:57.862
It's Dipper's stuff.
It ain't your locker no more.

143
00:18:00.403 --> 00:18:03.115
What you talking about?
It's been my locker for six years.

144
00:18:03.201 --> 00:18:04.576
Where's my gear?

145
00:18:04.661 --> 00:18:07.288
Mickey told me to bag it and hang it.

146
00:18:11.914 --> 00:18:14.125
You put my stuff on skid row.

147
00:18:14.211 --> 00:18:18.298
I been in that locker for six years,
and you put my stuff on skid row?

148
00:18:18.383 --> 00:18:20.798
Mickey tells me what to do, I gotta do it.

149
00:18:20.884 --> 00:18:22.303
Where is he?

150
00:18:22.384 --> 00:18:24.806
He's outside working with Dipper.

151
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.266
- He's in a bad mood.
- So am I.

152
00:18:37.652 --> 00:18:39.153
Keep your hands up.

153
00:18:39.237 --> 00:18:41.989
Keep your hands up. Watch the right.

154
00:18:42.403 --> 00:18:43.740
- Hey, Mick.
- Shut up!

155
00:18:43.825 --> 00:18:45.990
To the body. Attaboy.

156
00:18:49.122 --> 00:18:51.124
Time. Time!

157
00:18:53.084 --> 00:18:54.750
What do you want?

158
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.171
- How you feeling today?
- What?

159
00:18:57.255 --> 00:18:59.336
- How you feeling?
- Are you a doctor?

160
00:18:59.423 --> 00:19:02.384
- You have problems today?
- Never mind. What's your problem?

161
00:19:02.468 --> 00:19:06.471
I been talking to Michael.
How come I been put out of my locker?

162
00:19:06.556 --> 00:19:09.932
Because Dipper needed it.
Dipper's a contender.

163
00:19:10.018 --> 00:19:12.225
He's a climber.
Do you know what you are?

164
00:19:12.309 --> 00:19:14.605
- You're a tomato.
- Tomato?

165
00:19:14.689 --> 00:19:17.855
I run a business here,
not a goddamn soup kitchen.

166
00:19:17.942 --> 00:19:19.902
- Did you fight last night?
- Yeah.

167
00:19:19.986 --> 00:19:22.986
- Did you win?
- Yeah, I won K.O. In the second.

168
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.778
Yeah? Who'd you fight?

169
00:19:24.865 --> 00:19:26.284
Spider Rico.

170
00:19:26.615 --> 00:19:28.036
He's a bum!

171
00:19:28.741 --> 00:19:32.202
- You think everybody I fight is a bum.
- Well, ain't they?

172
00:19:32.288 --> 00:19:35.414
You got heart,
but you fight like a goddamn ape.

173
00:19:35.789 --> 00:19:38.711
The only thing special about you,
you never got your nose busted.

174
00:19:38.796 --> 00:19:42.508
Leave it that way. Nice and pretty
and what's left of your mind.

175
00:19:42.592 --> 00:19:45.303
I think I'm gonna go take a steam.
You know why?

176
00:19:45.384 --> 00:19:48.054
Because I did good last night,
and you should've seen me.

177
00:19:48.137 --> 00:19:50.682
- Big deal.
- You should've seen me too.

178
00:19:50.767 --> 00:19:52.057
Hey, kid.

179
00:19:52.477 --> 00:19:54.979
- You ever think about retiring?
- No.

180
00:19:55.063 --> 00:19:56.730
- You think about it.
- Yeah.

181
00:19:56.814 --> 00:19:58.395
All right, time.

182
00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.067
- Time!
- What?

183
00:20:00.356 --> 00:20:02.278
I dig your locker, man.

184
00:20:05.073 --> 00:20:06.740
Dig your locker.

185
00:20:09.115 --> 00:20:10.240
Attaboy.

186
00:20:40.942 --> 00:20:42.356
Cold night.

187
00:20:43.317 --> 00:20:46.364
Whew! Good night to catch pneumonia,
you know?

188
00:20:50.115 --> 00:20:52.116
You need some help?

189
00:20:52.951 --> 00:20:55.873
There's a good game
at the Spectrum tonight.

190
00:20:58.375 --> 00:21:00.836
You wanna go to a basketball game?

191
00:21:03.961 --> 00:21:05.758
Hi, Butkus. Hi, kid.

192
00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.305
Tough day today.
They took my locker away.

193
00:21:11.385 --> 00:21:14.182
I had that locker for six years.
It don't bother me.

194
00:21:14.267 --> 00:21:15.807
Lockers are bad, anyway, after a while.

195
00:21:15.893 --> 00:21:17.144
People get the combination.

196
00:21:17.228 --> 00:21:21.105
I must've had 20 bucks
taken out of there in the past 6 years.

197
00:21:21.395 --> 00:21:24.231
Don't sound like much, but it adds up.

198
00:21:24.317 --> 00:21:26.362
Doesn't matter. Who cares?

199
00:21:28.278 --> 00:21:30.573
Yeah, cold night. Hey, birds.

200
00:21:30.656 --> 00:21:33.326
Hey, look who's here. Look who's here.

201
00:21:33.411 --> 00:21:34.951
The giant worm.

202
00:21:36.163 --> 00:21:40.375
Look at these birds.
Don't these birds look like flying candy?

203
00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.293
Bird, you wanna fly me home?

204
00:21:42.376 --> 00:21:44.881
You need somebody to walk you home?

205
00:21:45.131 --> 00:21:46.298
- No.
- No?

206
00:21:47.048 --> 00:21:50.928
It's a cold night.
If you got the money, take a cab.

207
00:21:51.009 --> 00:21:53.135
Too many creeps around here.

208
00:21:53.765 --> 00:21:56.307
Every other block, there's a creep.

209
00:21:56.642 --> 00:21:58.807
You can always tell a creep.

210
00:22:00.894 --> 00:22:02.690
Listen. I'm gonna go now, okay?

211
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:04.480
I'll see you later, all right?

212
00:22:04.567 --> 00:22:08.359
None of you guys get up.
I know you had a hard day in the cage.

213
00:22:08.443 --> 00:22:09.653
So,

214
00:22:09.903 --> 00:22:12.659
I'm gonna go home, make up a joke.
I'll tell you a new joke tomorrow.

215
00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.490
Okay? Good night, Adrian.

216
00:22:14.576 --> 00:22:16.287
Good night, Rocky.

217
00:22:35.346 --> 00:22:37.392
Don't know what happened.

218
00:22:38.643 --> 00:22:41.558
Hey, there, Lefty. Got a friend for you here.

219
00:22:41.644 --> 00:22:43.855
- Hello, Rock.
- How you doing?

220
00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.150
- You seen Paulie?
- Yeah, he's in the steam room.

221
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:49.067
- Yeah.
- Hey, Rocky. What's with the eye?

222
00:22:49.153 --> 00:22:51.112
- Been fighting.
- Hope you won it, at least.

223
00:22:51.195 --> 00:22:53.028
Oh, yeah, did real good.
You should've seen me.

224
00:22:53.115 --> 00:22:56.076
<i>... heavyweight champion of the world</i>
<i>Apollo Creed at Kennedy Airport...</i>

225
00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.287
Hey, Rock, who'd you fight?

226
00:22:58.371 --> 00:22:59.788
Spider Rico.

227
00:23:00.163 --> 00:23:02.125
Jesus. Is he still around?

228
00:23:02.208 --> 00:23:05.375
Yeah, he's doing real good.
He's doing better than you are.

229
00:23:05.461 --> 00:23:09.086
Hey, Paulie. What, do you lock the door?
Yo, Paulie.

230
00:23:09.837 --> 00:23:12.215
I'd like to kill the freaking moron
who broke the mirror.

231
00:23:12.298 --> 00:23:13.928
Hey, yo, Paulie.

232
00:23:14.634 --> 00:23:19.057
Every day, every night, I pass by.
Your sister's giving me the shoulder.

233
00:23:19.142 --> 00:23:20.807
- Forget her.
- What do you mean?

234
00:23:20.893 --> 00:23:22.894
- You can do better than her.
- I don't forget nothing.

235
00:23:22.979 --> 00:23:25.019
Every night I pass by, I tell a joke.

236
00:23:25.105 --> 00:23:27.730
Every morning I pass by, I tell a joke.

237
00:23:27.817 --> 00:23:29.902
She just looks at me,
you know what I mean?

238
00:23:29.986 --> 00:23:32.903
- Looks?
- Yeah, like I'm a plate of leftovers.

239
00:23:32.989 --> 00:23:34.740
I need a Cadillac
to connect with your sister?

240
00:23:34.824 --> 00:23:37.076
Something wrong with my face?

241
00:23:37.826 --> 00:23:39.745
She's a freaking loser.

242
00:23:39.828 --> 00:23:43.082
Sometimes she gets me so crazy,
I could split her head with a razor.

243
00:23:43.163 --> 00:23:46.085
- Don't get mental.
- You caught me in a bad mood.

244
00:23:46.169 --> 00:23:49.005
- You're always in a bad mood.
- Adrian ain't sharp.

245
00:23:49.086 --> 00:23:50.961
Adrian is a loser.

246
00:23:51.048 --> 00:23:53.423
She's pushing 30 freaking years old.

247
00:23:53.509 --> 00:23:55.845
If she don't watch out,
she's gonna die alone.

248
00:23:55.928 --> 00:23:58.554
- I'm 30 myself.
- And you'll die alone.

249
00:23:58.637 --> 00:24:00.596
I don't see no crowd around you neither.

250
00:24:00.682 --> 00:24:02.932
I'd like to kill the freaking moron
who broke the mirror.

251
00:24:03.019 --> 00:24:05.644
Come on. Let's get out of this stink.

252
00:24:06.644 --> 00:24:09.400
- I wanna talk to you anyway.
- About what?

253
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.903
- You still work for Gazzo?
- Yeah, sure.

254
00:24:11.986 --> 00:24:14.489
Why don't you talk to him about me?

255
00:24:14.739 --> 00:24:17.700
I just don't think Gazzo's hiring right now.

256
00:24:18.284 --> 00:24:20.326
You know? Come on.

257
00:24:24.499 --> 00:24:26.664
- The girl's drying up.
- Who?

258
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:30.336
My sister. If she don't start living,
her body's gonna dry up.

259
00:24:30.421 --> 00:24:32.798
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving, you know that?

260
00:24:32.882 --> 00:24:35.759
- Come over and talk to her.
- Sure. Beer.

261
00:24:36.173 --> 00:24:38.134
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?

262
00:24:38.221 --> 00:24:40.471
Absolutely. You got it.

263
00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.932
I gotta go. If I'm ten minutes late,
she calls the hospital.

264
00:24:44.018 --> 00:24:45.307
- Paulie!
- I got it.

265
00:24:45.394 --> 00:24:47.019
<i>... Bicentennial fight with Mac Lee Green</i>

266
00:24:47.105 --> 00:24:49.980
<i>here in Philadelphia</i>
<i>at the fabulous Spectrum.</i>

267
00:24:50.066 --> 00:24:51.230
<i>Larry.</i>

268
00:24:51.317 --> 00:24:53.778
<i>You're speaking now of your</i>
<i>much-publicized Bicentennial fight.</i>

269
00:24:53.861 --> 00:24:57.071
<i>Right. This is gonna be the greatest</i>
<i>sporting event in the country's history.</i>

270
00:24:57.154 --> 00:25:00.284
<i>A gala occurrence with me beating Green</i>
<i>like he committed a crime.</i>

271
00:25:00.365 --> 00:25:02.951
Would you take a look at that guy?

272
00:25:03.037 --> 00:25:06.207
I mean, where are the real fighters
gonna come from? The pros.

273
00:25:06.288 --> 00:25:08.664
All we got today are jig clowns.

274
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:11.125
<i>... on January 1st.</i>
<i>The first major event in the country's...</i>

275
00:25:11.211 --> 00:25:13.336
- Clown?
- That's right, clown.

276
00:25:14.173 --> 00:25:16.884
<i>And in keeping with great events</i>
<i>throughout the country's history,</i>

277
00:25:16.968 --> 00:25:20.971
<i>Apollo Creed will duplicate the cracking</i>
<i>of the Liberty Bell by cracking Green.</i>

278
00:25:21.055 --> 00:25:23.557
You're calling Apollo Creed a clown?

279
00:25:23.641 --> 00:25:25.557
What else? Look at him.

280
00:25:25.807 --> 00:25:28.019
<i>Stay in school and use your brain.</i>

281
00:25:28.104 --> 00:25:31.065
<i>Be a doctor, be a lawyer,</i>
<i>carry a leather briefcase.</i>

282
00:25:31.145 --> 00:25:34.652
<i>Forget about sports as a profession.</i>
<i>Sports make you grunt and smell.</i>

283
00:25:34.736 --> 00:25:38.364
<i>- Be a thinker, not a stinker.</i>
<i>- Thanks a lot, champ.</i>

284
00:25:38.448 --> 00:25:40.654
You crazy?
This man is champion of the world.

285
00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.411
He took his best shot and become champ.

286
00:25:44.076 --> 00:25:46.076
What shot did you ever take?

287
00:25:46.163 --> 00:25:49.375
Hey, Rocky,
you're not happy with your life, that's nice.

288
00:25:49.459 --> 00:25:52.750
But me, I got a business going.
I don't have to take no shots.

289
00:25:52.836 --> 00:25:54.836
<i>... no one having gone</i>
<i>more than 12 rounds with him...</i>

290
00:25:54.922 --> 00:25:57.633
- That's right.
<i>...and that was Jake Dale last June...</i>

291
00:25:57.717 --> 00:26:01.429
- Stick that up your business.
- Why you getting so insulted?

292
00:26:01.971 --> 00:26:04.596
You want me to take a shot? All right.

293
00:26:04.807 --> 00:26:06.392
I'll take a shot.

294
00:26:20.028 --> 00:26:22.529
- Hey, Rocky, how about a bottle?
- No wine, man.

295
00:26:22.615 --> 00:26:25.826
- Come on. Just a little.
- Buy us some Thunderbird.

296
00:26:27.246 --> 00:26:29.457
Marie, does your brother know
you're hanging out so late?

297
00:26:29.538 --> 00:26:31.709
- Get lost, creep.
- Screw you, yo-yo!

298
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:33.836
These guys teach you to talk like that?

299
00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.756
- Stuff it!
- Don't you never say that to me.

300
00:26:37.461 --> 00:26:40.009
You stink up the neighborhood!

301
00:26:41.594 --> 00:26:43.429
You know, you can...

302
00:26:43.554 --> 00:26:47.807
When I was your age, only one girl in
the whole neighborhood talked like that.

303
00:26:47.892 --> 00:26:49.769
That was it. Just one.

304
00:26:49.932 --> 00:26:53.061
What are you doing?
It'll make your teeth yellow. Don't do that.

305
00:26:53.144 --> 00:26:54.440
I like yellow teeth!

306
00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.898
- It'll make your breath like garbage.
- Maybe I like garbage.

307
00:26:56.981 --> 00:26:58.778
Nobody likes garbage.

308
00:26:59.192 --> 00:27:01.696
Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth
wasn't bad looking,

309
00:27:01.779 --> 00:27:04.279
but none of the guys ever took her serious.

310
00:27:04.365 --> 00:27:06.201
They never took her out
for any serious date.

311
00:27:06.285 --> 00:27:07.826
- Why?
- 'Cause that's the way guys are.

312
00:27:07.912 --> 00:27:09.952
They laugh when you talk dirty.
They think you're cute.

313
00:27:10.038 --> 00:27:12.706
After a while, you get a reputation.
You get no respect.

314
00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:15.125
You understand? You get no respect.

315
00:27:15.211 --> 00:27:17.922
I gotta use a bad word, whore.

316
00:27:18.006 --> 00:27:19.923
You understand? Whore.

317
00:27:20.008 --> 00:27:23.970
See? You use dirty words,
and maybe you end up becoming a whore.

318
00:27:24.345 --> 00:27:25.971
Come on, Rocky. I'm 12.

319
00:27:26.055 --> 00:27:28.432
That don't matter.

320
00:27:28.516 --> 00:27:31.602
You don't really have to be one.
Just act like one and that's it.

321
00:27:31.682 --> 00:27:35.355
Boom! Bing! You get a bad rep.
You understand?

322
00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:38.981
Twenty years from now,
people are gonna say,

323
00:27:39.067 --> 00:27:41.403
"Do you remember Marie?"
"No. Who was she?"

324
00:27:41.487 --> 00:27:44.073
"She was the little whore who hung down
at the Atomic Hoagie Shop."

325
00:27:44.153 --> 00:27:46.451
"Oh, yeah. Now I remember her."

326
00:27:46.534 --> 00:27:50.038
You see, they don't remember you.
They remember the rep.

327
00:27:50.121 --> 00:27:51.663
You understand?

328
00:27:52.663 --> 00:27:55.960
You got a boyfriend?
No, you ain't got a boyfriend.

329
00:27:56.336 --> 00:27:59.086
You know why?
Why don't you think you have a boyfriend?

330
00:27:59.172 --> 00:28:01.962
'Cause you're hanging out with them
coconuts on the corner.

331
00:28:02.048 --> 00:28:03.840
You hang around coconuts,
you get nowhere.

332
00:28:03.924 --> 00:28:05.678
They're lemons. Lemons.

333
00:28:05.759 --> 00:28:08.806
You hang out with nice people,
you get nice friends. You understand?

334
00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:11.351
You hang out with smart people,
you get smart friends.

335
00:28:11.432 --> 00:28:13.978
You hang out with yo-yo people,
you get yo-yo friends.

336
00:28:14.058 --> 00:28:16.480
You see, it's simple mathematics.

337
00:28:17.315 --> 00:28:18.816
- I hope you ain't...
- I won't.

338
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:19.980
What was I gonna say?

339
00:28:20.067 --> 00:28:23.112
You hope I don't keep acting
like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?

340
00:28:23.192 --> 00:28:24.278
Yeah, something like that.

341
00:28:24.364 --> 00:28:25.490
Good night, Rocky.

342
00:28:25.573 --> 00:28:27.865
- Good night. Take care.
- Hey, Rocky.

343
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:30.576
- Yo.
- Screw you, creep-o!

344
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.297
Yeah, who are you to give advice, creep-o?

345
00:28:41.381 --> 00:28:42.798
Who are you?

346
00:29:01.651 --> 00:29:04.862
- Are the doctor's reports confirmed?
- Definitely.

347
00:29:05.113 --> 00:29:06.990
Says here Mac Lee Green has suffered

348
00:29:07.073 --> 00:29:10.576
"a severely cracked third metacarpal
in his left hand."

349
00:29:11.076 --> 00:29:12.412
Damn!

350
00:29:12.576 --> 00:29:16.582
We can cancel the fight indefinitely
if you're set on fighting Green.

351
00:29:16.663 --> 00:29:18.710
Hey, it ain't just Green.

352
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.336
What about all the time
Apollo has invested?

353
00:29:21.421 --> 00:29:23.086
We can find a solution.

354
00:29:23.172 --> 00:29:24.256
Solution nothing.

355
00:29:24.339 --> 00:29:27.048
Find me another ranked contender
in a flash, Jergens.

356
00:29:27.134 --> 00:29:29.095
Don't play games with my client.

357
00:29:29.178 --> 00:29:31.760
Apollo's already done a million dollars'
worth of publicity,

358
00:29:31.846 --> 00:29:34.767
has made contractual obligations
with 20 different organizations.

359
00:29:34.851 --> 00:29:36.557
He's not going to be embarrassed!

360
00:29:36.644 --> 00:29:39.019
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.

361
00:29:39.105 --> 00:29:41.065
Ernie's fighting in France that same week.

362
00:29:41.145 --> 00:29:43.274
Then get me Buddy Shaw.
He's ranked fifth.

363
00:29:43.357 --> 00:29:46.192
Went to California and gained 50 pounds.

364
00:29:46.778 --> 00:29:48.653
I called every worthwhile contender.

365
00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:52.701
They all say five weeks isn't enough time
to get into shape.

366
00:29:52.785 --> 00:29:55.288
Shape nothing, man. They're afraid.

367
00:29:55.413 --> 00:29:57.413
They know everybody
is gonna see this fight.

368
00:29:57.498 --> 00:29:59.288
None of them's got
a prayer of whipping me.

369
00:29:59.375 --> 00:30:03.418
They're making excuses so they don't
have to be the chump who gets whipped.

370
00:30:03.502 --> 00:30:06.132
All I can say is I'm a good promoter.

371
00:30:06.632 --> 00:30:09.798
I've promoted fights
in every goddamn country in the world

372
00:30:09.884 --> 00:30:12.053
and I've broken my ass over this one.

373
00:30:12.136 --> 00:30:14.346
I don't know what else to do!

374
00:30:19.933 --> 00:30:21.105
I do.

375
00:30:23.441 --> 00:30:27.403
Without a ranked contender,
what this fight needs is a novelty.

376
00:30:27.817 --> 00:30:30.278
This is the land of opportunity, right?

377
00:30:30.365 --> 00:30:32.784
So, Apollo Creed, on January 1st,

378
00:30:32.865 --> 00:30:35.951
gives a local underdog fighter
an opportunity.

379
00:30:36.663 --> 00:30:41.000
A snow-white underdog, and I'm gonna
put his face on this poster with me.

380
00:30:41.084 --> 00:30:42.960
And I'll tell you why.

381
00:30:43.044 --> 00:30:45.046
Because I'm sentimental.

382
00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:48.132
A lot of other people in this country
are just as sentimental

383
00:30:48.212 --> 00:30:51.009
and there's nothing they'd like better
than to see Apollo Creed

384
00:30:51.094 --> 00:30:54.221
give a local Philadelphia boy
a shot at the greatest title in the world

385
00:30:54.305 --> 00:30:56.639
on this country's biggest birthday.

386
00:30:56.722 --> 00:30:58.807
Now that's the way I see it

387
00:30:59.143 --> 00:31:01.394
and that's the way it's gonna be.

388
00:31:01.479 --> 00:31:03.144
Apollo, I like it.

389
00:31:03.644 --> 00:31:05.400
It's very American.

390
00:31:06.105 --> 00:31:09.112
No, Jergens. It's very smart.

391
00:31:33.678 --> 00:31:35.846
- What is it?
- I wanna check this thing out.

392
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:39.682
You said pick up two yards from Snyder
and a grand from Cappoli, right?

393
00:31:39.767 --> 00:31:43.855
No, no. Two yards from Cappoli
and a grand from Snyder.

394
00:31:43.938 --> 00:31:45.687
- Two yards.
- Write it down, okay?

395
00:31:45.771 --> 00:31:47.355
Yeah, I got it.

396
00:31:47.442 --> 00:31:50.862
Who's this girl you're going out with
tomorrow night?

397
00:31:51.028 --> 00:31:53.193
- How'd you know?
- I know.

398
00:31:53.278 --> 00:31:56.409
Don't you think I hear things?
Lot of canaries flying around the docks.

399
00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:58.701
- I'm going out with Paulie's sister.
- Hey, Rocky.

400
00:31:58.786 --> 00:32:00.997
- What?
- I hear she's retarded.

401
00:32:01.201 --> 00:32:03.249
She ain't retarded. She's shy, you know?

402
00:32:03.333 --> 00:32:07.875
Tell you what to do. Take her to the zoo.
I hear retards like the zoo.

403
00:32:07.961 --> 00:32:09.836
- This bum gotta say that?
- Who you calling a bum?

404
00:32:09.922 --> 00:32:11.712
- Back it up, Buddy.
- I'm calling you a bum!

405
00:32:11.798 --> 00:32:15.094
Relax, relax. Buddy's in a bad mood.
It's his prostate.

406
00:32:15.178 --> 00:32:18.260
He's always in a bad mood.
You ought to count your blessings.

407
00:32:18.346 --> 00:32:20.014
You're still a healthy person.

408
00:32:20.098 --> 00:32:22.307
- I don't like your face.
- I don't like yours either!

409
00:32:22.393 --> 00:32:24.433
- Kiss my ass!
- Come out here!

410
00:32:24.519 --> 00:32:27.063
Relax! Relax. My ears.

411
00:32:27.147 --> 00:32:29.776
Are you driving me crazy? Both of you.

412
00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:32.567
Look. Buddy doesn't like you.

413
00:32:33.067 --> 00:32:35.903
Some guys, they just hate for no reason.
<i>Capisce?</i>

414
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:37.659
- Yeah.
- Come here.

415
00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:42.493
Here's 50 bucks. You and your girl Adrian,
you have a nice time.

416
00:32:42.577 --> 00:32:43.788
Thanks.

417
00:32:45.038 --> 00:32:47.039
How'd you know her name?

418
00:32:47.125 --> 00:32:49.375
You don't think I hear things?

419
00:32:50.086 --> 00:32:51.461
- Hey, Rock.
- What?

420
00:32:51.547 --> 00:32:52.879
- Remember what I told you?
- What'd you tell me?

421
00:32:52.963 --> 00:32:54.092
Take her to the zoo.

422
00:32:54.173 --> 00:32:56.094
Come on out of the car!

423
00:33:02.596 --> 00:33:05.894
- Some more coffee, Mr. Creed?
- No, thanks, Shirley.

424
00:33:06.558 --> 00:33:08.355
What do you think about Billy Snow?

425
00:33:08.439 --> 00:33:09.605
Fouls.

426
00:33:11.105 --> 00:33:12.981
How about Big Chuck Smith?

427
00:33:13.067 --> 00:33:15.113
No, he's too old and dull.

428
00:33:15.278 --> 00:33:17.196
Hey, that Bobby Judge, he's a good boy.

429
00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:18.990
No. I don't feel no heat from that name.

430
00:33:19.075 --> 00:33:21.201
Joe Zack's a good prospect.

431
00:33:22.451 --> 00:33:25.288
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?

432
00:33:26.374 --> 00:33:28.625
This is what I'm looking for.

433
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:30.875
The Italian Stallion.

434
00:33:31.295 --> 00:33:33.711
Rocky Balboa? Never heard of him.

435
00:33:34.173 --> 00:33:36.217
Look, it's the name, man.

436
00:33:36.298 --> 00:33:38.298
The Italian Stallion.

437
00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.884
The media will eat it up.

438
00:33:40.971 --> 00:33:43.807
Who discovered America?
An Italian, right?

439
00:33:44.142 --> 00:33:47.644
What would be better than to get it on
with one of his descendants?

440
00:33:47.729 --> 00:33:49.188
He's a southpaw.

441
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:50.980
I don't want you messing around
with southpaws.

442
00:33:51.065 --> 00:33:53.148
- They do everything backwards.
- Southpaw nothing.

443
00:33:53.232 --> 00:33:55.153
I'll drop him in three.

444
00:33:56.237 --> 00:33:59.990
Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.

445
00:34:01.784 --> 00:34:03.866
Sounds like a damn monster movie.

446
00:34:04.201 --> 00:34:06.247
What are you doing with that bat?

447
00:34:06.327 --> 00:34:07.999
I used to be deadly at stickball.

448
00:34:08.082 --> 00:34:10.914
- Your sister knows I'm coming?
- She's very excited.

449
00:34:11.294 --> 00:34:13.375
- Look at these swollen hands.
- Yeah.

450
00:34:13.461 --> 00:34:16.882
The joints from carrying meat
in and out of the freezer.

451
00:34:16.965 --> 00:34:20.177
- Plays hell on the joints.
- Maybe you ought to see a doctor.

452
00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:22.179
I don't need a doctor.
I need a different job.

453
00:34:22.262 --> 00:34:24.681
Different job. What kind of turkey?
Big? Small?

454
00:34:24.766 --> 00:34:28.143
Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a good man.

455
00:34:28.226 --> 00:34:31.271
Nothing bothers me.
I'd make a great collector.

456
00:34:31.356 --> 00:34:33.358
Busting bones don't bother me.

457
00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.818
Don't bother you. Big turkey, right?

458
00:34:35.902 --> 00:34:38.905
Gazzo's gotta give me... Forget Gazzo.
It's a bad job.

459
00:34:38.987 --> 00:34:40.530
You got a match?

460
00:34:40.614 --> 00:34:42.532
Go to him for me. As a favor.

461
00:34:42.617 --> 00:34:45.369
Yeah, yeah. Last time I had a turkey

462
00:34:45.452 --> 00:34:48.956
was when they had a two-dollar special
at Horn and Hardart's three years ago.

463
00:34:49.039 --> 00:34:51.541
Last year, me and the turtles had Spam.

464
00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.721
- Your sister knows I'm coming?
- Yeah, yeah. She's very excited.

465
00:35:07.099 --> 00:35:09.476
Will you forget about Gazzo?

466
00:35:10.143 --> 00:35:11.646
I don't ask nobody twice.

467
00:35:11.728 --> 00:35:13.648
Don't ask nobody twice.

468
00:35:19.152 --> 00:35:21.114
You're sure your sister knows I'm coming?

469
00:35:21.197 --> 00:35:23.239
Yeah. She's very excited.

470
00:35:26.911 --> 00:35:28.663
Paulie, you're late.

471
00:35:29.706 --> 00:35:30.998
You call the hospital?

472
00:35:31.081 --> 00:35:34.168
She calls the hospital
if I'm ten minutes late.

473
00:35:35.085 --> 00:35:36.795
Yo, how you doing?

474
00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.257
I told you, she's very excited.

475
00:35:42.844 --> 00:35:45.179
Why didn't you tell me
you were bringing him here?

476
00:35:45.262 --> 00:35:46.847
I'm not ready for this.

477
00:35:46.931 --> 00:35:49.349
Would it make a difference if you were?

478
00:35:49.434 --> 00:35:51.893
- He's taking you out.
- No, I can't.

479
00:35:53.186 --> 00:35:55.940
I want you out of the kitchen right now.

480
00:35:56.606 --> 00:35:57.858
I won't.

481
00:36:02.739 --> 00:36:05.282
I want you out of here instamatically!

482
00:36:05.364 --> 00:36:07.994
I'm sick of seeing you
hanging around like a freaking spider.

483
00:36:08.077 --> 00:36:10.246
Go out and live. Enjoy life!

484
00:36:10.454 --> 00:36:12.081
I can't go!

485
00:36:12.164 --> 00:36:14.083
Don't get wise with me now.

486
00:36:14.166 --> 00:36:15.876
I'm tired of you being a loser.

487
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.128
Don't call me that, Paulie!

488
00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:21.132
<i>Apollo Creed says he'll be shopping</i>
<i>for another victim</i>

489
00:36:21.215 --> 00:36:24.969
<i>to fill Green's vacancy</i>
<i>for the Bicentennial championship fight...</i>

490
00:36:25.052 --> 00:36:26.762
Why didn't you tell me
you were bringing him home?

491
00:36:26.846 --> 00:36:28.139
How do you know I didn't?

492
00:36:28.222 --> 00:36:31.059
I can't go, Paulie. I won't go!

493
00:36:31.141 --> 00:36:32.226
Why?

494
00:36:33.226 --> 00:36:36.688
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving.
I got a turkey in the oven.

495
00:36:37.398 --> 00:36:39.442
Oh, a turkey in the oven.

496
00:36:46.157 --> 00:36:47.909
Turkey in the oven.

497
00:36:54.998 --> 00:36:58.710
You want the bird?
Go in the alley and eat the bird!

498
00:36:59.335 --> 00:37:00.797
Aw, Paulie!

499
00:37:01.797 --> 00:37:04.759
I want you out of here!
Get out of the house!

500
00:37:05.009 --> 00:37:07.552
Go out and enjoy your freaking life!

501
00:37:11.766 --> 00:37:13.434
You hungry, Rock?

502
00:37:20.108 --> 00:37:23.820
Hey, yo, Paulie, maybe we better
forget all this, you know?

503
00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.447
Forget nothing. Go ahead.
Tell her something funny.

504
00:37:27.532 --> 00:37:30.702
Ain't nothing to talk about.
She's in a bad mood. I'm in a bad mood.

505
00:37:30.784 --> 00:37:33.538
You can do funny things.
You wanna go out with my sister?

506
00:37:33.621 --> 00:37:35.164
- Yeah.
- Well...

507
00:37:39.376 --> 00:37:41.003
I don't know what to say.

508
00:37:41.085 --> 00:37:42.255
Funny.

509
00:37:53.891 --> 00:37:56.018
Yo, Adrian. It's me, Rocky.

510
00:37:56.393 --> 00:37:58.061
Rocky, you know?

511
00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:59.938
Listen,

512
00:38:02.233 --> 00:38:06.695
I don't know what to say, 'cause I ain't
never talked to no door before.

513
00:38:07.864 --> 00:38:11.074
What do I say to a door?
We better forget this.

514
00:38:11.409 --> 00:38:12.577
You're doing fine.

515
00:38:12.659 --> 00:38:14.996
I ain't doing fine. I look like an idiot.

516
00:38:15.079 --> 00:38:17.081
Keep doing what you're doing. Funny.

517
00:38:17.164 --> 00:38:19.375
I know all about these things.

518
00:38:19.458 --> 00:38:21.210
I feel like a jerk.

519
00:38:27.215 --> 00:38:29.635
Yo, Adrian, it's Rocky again.

520
00:38:29.719 --> 00:38:34.306
Listen, I know you ain't too happy
at this moment.

521
00:38:34.849 --> 00:38:36.516
But could you do me a favor?

522
00:38:36.601 --> 00:38:39.603
I ain't got nobody
to spend Thanksgiving with.

523
00:38:39.771 --> 00:38:43.106
So, how about maybe you and I

524
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:44.983
go out together, get something to eat.

525
00:38:45.068 --> 00:38:47.612
Maybe laugh a little bit.
Who knows, you know?

526
00:38:47.695 --> 00:38:49.447
Would you like to...

527
00:38:51.282 --> 00:38:54.117
Would you like to, maybe,
you and me go out together?

528
00:38:54.202 --> 00:38:56.788
What do you think? Would you like to?

529
00:39:01.793 --> 00:39:04.003
We're gonna have a good time.

530
00:39:04.378 --> 00:39:06.547
We'll have a real good time.

531
00:39:11.094 --> 00:39:12.887
Thanks for the bird.

532
00:39:16.516 --> 00:39:19.434
I'm gonna turn the TV off.
I got a headache.

533
00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.199
- What's your sister like to do?
- Ice-skate.

534
00:39:34.282 --> 00:39:36.284
Adrian, come on.
You're letting the heat out.

535
00:39:36.369 --> 00:39:38.663
Who pays the bills around here?

536
00:39:44.251 --> 00:39:47.380
Listen, I don't want no turkey anyway,
you know?

537
00:39:48.965 --> 00:39:50.967
But it was Thanksgiving.

538
00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:52.927
What?

539
00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:54.971
- It was Thanksgiving.
- Yeah, to you.

540
00:39:55.054 --> 00:39:57.347
But to me it's Thursday, right?

541
00:40:21.706 --> 00:40:24.375
- It looks kind of quiet.
- I think it's closed.

542
00:40:24.458 --> 00:40:27.585
No, I think we're just early
or something like that.

543
00:40:29.005 --> 00:40:30.840
- We're closed.
- What?

544
00:40:31.172 --> 00:40:34.135
- I said we're closed.
- Yeah. Hey, listen.

545
00:40:34.217 --> 00:40:37.554
I'm gonna smooth this guy out. Wait here.
I'll be right back.

546
00:40:37.764 --> 00:40:39.556
- We could go someplace else.
- No, it's okay.

547
00:40:39.639 --> 00:40:43.603
Are you closed to the general public,
or are you just closed to everybody?

548
00:40:43.686 --> 00:40:47.856
It's after 6:00. It's Thanksgiving.
That's why there's nobody here.

549
00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:50.233
Besides, you ain't supposed to be in here.

550
00:40:50.318 --> 00:40:52.820
So do me a favor and not stay here.

551
00:40:52.902 --> 00:40:56.449
- Could you do me a favor?
- Come on. We're not operating.

552
00:40:56.699 --> 00:40:59.534
Look. This girl here ain't feeling well.

553
00:40:59.619 --> 00:41:02.163
Doctors say she should go out
and exercise.

554
00:41:02.246 --> 00:41:04.373
Ice-skating's probably the best thing.

555
00:41:04.456 --> 00:41:05.708
So what do you want from me?

556
00:41:05.791 --> 00:41:07.668
Well, hey, I want you to do me a favor.

557
00:41:07.751 --> 00:41:09.335
You can see she ain't feeling too good.

558
00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:12.422
If you can let her on the ice
for a few minutes, I'd appreciate it.

559
00:41:12.507 --> 00:41:14.300
Ten minutes, ten bucks.

560
00:41:14.384 --> 00:41:16.552
Ten bucks? How about eight bucks?

561
00:41:16.635 --> 00:41:18.762
Come on. It's Thanksgiving.

562
00:41:19.012 --> 00:41:20.889
All right. Nine bucks, you got a deal.

563
00:41:20.972 --> 00:41:23.726
You have the ice to yourself. Ten bucks.

564
00:41:25.853 --> 00:41:27.605
Give her the blades.

565
00:41:28.398 --> 00:41:29.690
Aren't you skating?

566
00:41:29.773 --> 00:41:31.733
No, I ain't skated since I was 15.

567
00:41:31.818 --> 00:41:34.112
That's when I started fighting.

568
00:41:34.402 --> 00:41:37.072
Skating's kind of bad for the ankles,
you know?

569
00:41:38.032 --> 00:41:40.784
You're a pretty good skater, aren't you?

570
00:41:41.577 --> 00:41:44.079
Like I was saying
before on the way over here,

571
00:41:44.163 --> 00:41:47.333
fighting used to be tops with me,
but no more.

572
00:41:47.416 --> 00:41:49.918
All I wanted to do out of fighting
was prove I was no bum,

573
00:41:50.003 --> 00:41:52.422
that I had the stuff to make a good pro.

574
00:41:52.505 --> 00:41:55.507
- You never got the chance?
- I ain't crying about it.

575
00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:57.844
I still fight. I do it like a hobby.

576
00:41:57.927 --> 00:42:00.096
The trouble is I'm a southpaw.

577
00:42:00.179 --> 00:42:03.099
- What's a southpaw?
- A southpaw means you're left-handed.

578
00:42:03.181 --> 00:42:05.559
A southpaw throws your timing off.

579
00:42:05.643 --> 00:42:07.936
It throws other guys' timing off,
makes them look awkward.

580
00:42:08.021 --> 00:42:09.605
Nobody wants to look awkward.

581
00:42:09.688 --> 00:42:12.858
- You know where "southpaw" came from?
- Nine minutes!

582
00:42:12.942 --> 00:42:15.987
A long time ago, there was this guy,
maybe a couple hundred years ago,

583
00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:19.532
he was fighting in the...
I think it was around Philadelphia.

584
00:42:19.614 --> 00:42:23.577
His arm... He was left-handed.
His arm was facing towards New Jersey.

585
00:42:23.661 --> 00:42:27.498
And that's south. So naturally
they called him "south paw." You see?

586
00:42:27.581 --> 00:42:30.876
Southpaw, South Jersey, South Camden.

587
00:42:31.335 --> 00:42:33.170
Southpaw. You know what I mean?

588
00:42:34.672 --> 00:42:36.797
Things probably worked out for the best,
don't you think?

589
00:42:36.882 --> 00:42:39.552
Never got a chance
because you're left-handed, huh?

590
00:42:39.635 --> 00:42:41.721
That's absolutely true, you know?

591
00:42:41.804 --> 00:42:43.056
Watch out.

592
00:42:45.056 --> 00:42:48.101
Ah! Ah! I just dislocated my finger.

593
00:42:48.436 --> 00:42:49.978
Ah! Look at that.

594
00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:52.523
Wait. It ain't your fault. Look.

595
00:42:52.606 --> 00:42:54.983
See? I had it... It's an old wound.

596
00:42:55.068 --> 00:42:57.320
You see that? Look. See?

597
00:42:57.402 --> 00:42:58.820
Nothing. It bends like that.

598
00:42:58.905 --> 00:43:01.864
I originally done it... Push the button.
Bong. It works.

599
00:43:01.949 --> 00:43:04.827
- It ain't your fault. Look.
- Seven minutes!

600
00:43:05.577 --> 00:43:08.581
I originally done it...
I carry pictures of all my fights.

601
00:43:08.664 --> 00:43:11.416
I originally done it
in the Baby Crenshaw fight.

602
00:43:11.501 --> 00:43:14.545
Baby's about the size of an airplane.
I broke both hands on his face.

603
00:43:14.628 --> 00:43:18.007
I lost that fight, but that's a nice picture,
don't you think?

604
00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:19.425
Real nice.

605
00:43:20.885 --> 00:43:23.262
Come on. You having a good time?

606
00:43:23.971 --> 00:43:25.889
You can see I ain't too graceful.

607
00:43:25.972 --> 00:43:30.353
I don't move well, but I can really swat.
I can really hit hard.

608
00:43:30.436 --> 00:43:34.106
But I'm a southpaw,
and nobody wants to fight no southpaw.

609
00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:42.072
You know how I got started in fighting?

610
00:43:42.155 --> 00:43:43.239
No.

611
00:43:44.032 --> 00:43:45.952
Am I talking too loud?

612
00:43:46.244 --> 00:43:47.829
Three minutes!

613
00:43:47.911 --> 00:43:52.458
My father, he's a...
My old man, he was never too smart.

614
00:43:52.541 --> 00:43:54.626
He says to me,
"You weren't born with much of a brain,

615
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:57.213
"so you better start using your body."

616
00:43:57.295 --> 00:43:59.215
So I become a fighter.

617
00:43:59.882 --> 00:44:01.634
You know what I mean?

618
00:44:01.717 --> 00:44:03.552
Why you laughing?

619
00:44:04.887 --> 00:44:07.806
My mother, she said the opposite thing.

620
00:44:07.889 --> 00:44:10.143
What did she say the opposite?

621
00:44:10.768 --> 00:44:13.061
She said,
"You weren't born with much of a body,

622
00:44:13.146 --> 00:44:14.896
"so you better develop your brain."

623
00:44:14.981 --> 00:44:17.733
- Did she say that?
- Yo, time!

624
00:44:19.027 --> 00:44:21.902
- Can I ask you a question?
- Absolutely.

625
00:44:23.155 --> 00:44:26.576
- Why do you wanna fight?
- 'Cause I can't sing or dance.

626
00:44:28.244 --> 00:44:29.954
Don't fall!

627
00:44:31.204 --> 00:44:33.623
That was terrific. I'm pretty good at this.

628
00:44:33.708 --> 00:44:34.958
You like the way I skate?

629
00:44:35.043 --> 00:44:38.085
Last fight I had,
I had with this guy named Spider Rico.

630
00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:40.882
He busted my head up there.
You see that scar?

631
00:44:40.965 --> 00:44:43.967
I'll tell you,
things get pretty rough in the ring.

632
00:44:53.436 --> 00:44:56.396
You know,
some people are very shy by nature.

633
00:44:57.315 --> 00:44:58.690
I suppose.

634
00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:04.489
I say you're very shy by nature, you know?

635
00:45:05.739 --> 00:45:07.114
I suppose.

636
00:45:09.786 --> 00:45:11.536
The bum from the dark.

637
00:45:11.621 --> 00:45:13.289
Get a job, you bum!

638
00:45:14.123 --> 00:45:17.001
Some people think
that being shy is a disease,

639
00:45:17.085 --> 00:45:19.045
but it don't bother me none.

640
00:45:19.128 --> 00:45:21.047
Don't bother me either.

641
00:45:22.382 --> 00:45:24.509
So why'd I bother bringing it up?

642
00:45:24.592 --> 00:45:26.760
'Cause I'm dumb, that's why.

643
00:45:28.012 --> 00:45:30.056
I think we make
a sharp couple of coconuts.

644
00:45:30.139 --> 00:45:32.974
I'm dumb and you're shy.
What do you think?

645
00:45:35.228 --> 00:45:38.815
I don't understand
why anybody would wanna be a fighter.

646
00:45:39.148 --> 00:45:44.445
You gotta be a moron to wanna
be a fighter, you know what I mean?

647
00:45:44.987 --> 00:45:48.489
It's a racket where you're
almost guaranteed to end up a bum.

648
00:45:48.574 --> 00:45:51.994
- I don't think you're a bum.
- I'm at least half a bum.

649
00:45:52.202 --> 00:45:54.371
But I'll tell you something.

650
00:45:55.248 --> 00:45:57.833
Worst thing about fighting
is the morning after.

651
00:45:57.916 --> 00:45:59.293
- You know?
- Morning after.

652
00:45:59.376 --> 00:46:01.253
Yeah, the morning after a fight,

653
00:46:01.335 --> 00:46:03.880
you're like a large wound,
you know what I mean?

654
00:46:03.965 --> 00:46:06.009
Sometimes I got pains all over me.

655
00:46:06.092 --> 00:46:09.804
I feel like calling a taxi to take me
from the bed into the bathroom.

656
00:46:09.887 --> 00:46:11.764
Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt.

657
00:46:11.847 --> 00:46:14.726
Your face is busted up.
Your hands are swollen.

658
00:46:14.809 --> 00:46:17.893
Look at this face. Sixty-four fights.
Look at that nose.

659
00:46:17.978 --> 00:46:20.731
You see that nose?
That nose ain't never been broken.

660
00:46:20.815 --> 00:46:23.150
I had guys busting on it.

661
00:46:23.233 --> 00:46:26.277
I had guys chewing on it,
twisting and punching it.

662
00:46:26.362 --> 00:46:27.947
I mean, whack, boom.

663
00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:30.532
These guys are hitting my nose
all the time.

664
00:46:30.614 --> 00:46:32.577
Never broke it. I'm very proud of that.

665
00:46:32.659 --> 00:46:34.244
That's rare.

666
00:46:34.329 --> 00:46:37.373
- Why do you do it if it hurts?
- Why you think?

667
00:46:38.791 --> 00:46:41.418
'Cause you can't sing and dance?

668
00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:44.213
Yeah, something like that.

669
00:46:44.297 --> 00:46:46.422
Hey, you wanna come inside?

670
00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.010
No, I gotta go.

671
00:46:50.094 --> 00:46:52.054
Hey, come on. I got some animals.

672
00:46:52.137 --> 00:46:54.556
I got these very rare animals inside.

673
00:46:54.639 --> 00:46:56.224
Come on in.

674
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:57.726
No, I gotta go.

675
00:46:57.809 --> 00:47:00.646
I gotta go, too, to the bathroom. Come on.

676
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:02.398
Come on.

677
00:47:02.481 --> 00:47:04.233
No, I gotta go.

678
00:47:04.317 --> 00:47:07.945
Look at this face.
Is that a face you could trust or what?

679
00:47:08.237 --> 00:47:12.407
Is it? They ought to stick this face
on a stamp. What do you think?

680
00:47:12.992 --> 00:47:14.577
Come on in.

681
00:47:20.166 --> 00:47:21.583
Yo, come on.

682
00:47:42.313 --> 00:47:43.523
Click.

683
00:47:49.152 --> 00:47:50.947
Yo, Adrian, you hungry?

684
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:52.407
No.

685
00:47:52.489 --> 00:47:54.157
I got some things in there.

686
00:47:54.242 --> 00:47:57.119
If you like sodas, doughnuts or something.

687
00:47:57.286 --> 00:47:59.454
Got a couple cupcakes. Huh?

688
00:47:59.664 --> 00:48:00.748
No?

689
00:48:01.081 --> 00:48:03.626
I got some chocolate in there. No?

690
00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:14.219
Hot in here, you know?

691
00:48:16.304 --> 00:48:18.431
I could go for some music.

692
00:48:24.063 --> 00:48:25.481
Yo, Adrian.

693
00:48:25.898 --> 00:48:28.735
These are the exotic animals
I was telling you about.

694
00:48:28.818 --> 00:48:30.945
These are my friends, Cuff and Link.

695
00:48:31.027 --> 00:48:33.780
- I sold them to you.
- I know you sold them to me.

696
00:48:33.864 --> 00:48:36.367
Remember you were working
at that pet shop?

697
00:48:36.451 --> 00:48:39.911
First day you was there, and I came in
and bought both these animals?

698
00:48:39.996 --> 00:48:41.121
I remember that.

699
00:48:41.204 --> 00:48:44.916
I bought this bowl
and the animals themselves.

700
00:48:45.001 --> 00:48:47.585
Some food,
the marbles that go on the bottom there.

701
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:49.630
Remember that mountain?

702
00:48:49.713 --> 00:48:53.885
I had to get rid of that mountain.
They kept fall over and flipping.

703
00:48:57.304 --> 00:49:00.141
Why don't you come over here
and sit down?

704
00:49:02.351 --> 00:49:04.728
It's a nice couch. I don't know.

705
00:49:06.898 --> 00:49:09.983
There's big bugs in there.
It's safer over here.

706
00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:14.322
You wanna sit down?

707
00:49:21.036 --> 00:49:22.579
These your parents?

708
00:49:22.664 --> 00:49:24.916
Yeah, that's both of them there.

709
00:49:24.998 --> 00:49:27.668
- Is this you?
- Yeah. I was eight years old.

710
00:49:27.751 --> 00:49:30.838
That's the Italian Stallion
when he was a baby.

711
00:49:33.007 --> 00:49:36.219
Come on over.
Make yourself comfortable. Relax.

712
00:49:41.681 --> 00:49:42.974
Do you have a phone?

713
00:49:43.059 --> 00:49:44.936
No, I had it pulled.

714
00:49:45.018 --> 00:49:46.853
'Cause people calling all the time,

715
00:49:46.938 --> 00:49:49.648
and who needs the aggravation, right?

716
00:49:49.731 --> 00:49:51.233
Interruptions.

717
00:49:51.608 --> 00:49:53.360
Who'd you wanna call?

718
00:49:53.443 --> 00:49:56.155
I wanna let my brother know where I am.

719
00:49:56.947 --> 00:49:58.032
Why?

720
00:49:59.701 --> 00:50:01.369
I think he might be worried.

721
00:50:01.452 --> 00:50:04.539
I'll call your brother, if that's the problem.

722
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.251
Yo, Paulie! Your sister's with me!

723
00:50:09.335 --> 00:50:11.963
I'll call you back later! See you!

724
00:50:18.594 --> 00:50:20.887
You don't like the room, do you?

725
00:50:20.972 --> 00:50:23.891
- It's fine.
- It's only temporary.

726
00:50:24.559 --> 00:50:26.101
It's not that.

727
00:50:31.023 --> 00:50:34.068
What's the problem? You don't like me?

728
00:50:34.152 --> 00:50:36.362
You don't like the turtles?
What's the problem?

729
00:50:36.445 --> 00:50:39.197
- I don't think I belong here.
- It's okay.

730
00:50:41.992 --> 00:50:43.786
I don't belong here.

731
00:50:44.454 --> 00:50:47.748
Well, you know, it's okay,
'cause you're my guest.

732
00:50:48.875 --> 00:50:51.878
I don't know you well enough.

733
00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:55.255
I've never been
in a man's apartment alone.

734
00:50:57.090 --> 00:50:59.927
Well, they're all the same, you know?

735
00:51:05.099 --> 00:51:07.684
I'm not sure I know you well enough.

736
00:51:09.061 --> 00:51:11.105
I don't feel comfortable.

737
00:51:11.271 --> 00:51:14.150
Yo, Adrian, I ain't so comfortable either.

738
00:51:16.568 --> 00:51:18.112
I should go.

739
00:51:18.195 --> 00:51:20.489
Don't go, please. Don't go.

740
00:51:22.532 --> 00:51:23.826
Don't go.

741
00:51:27.413 --> 00:51:29.039
Do me a favor.

742
00:51:29.123 --> 00:51:30.333
What?

743
00:51:30.416 --> 00:51:32.335
Take off these glasses.

744
00:51:36.005 --> 00:51:38.297
You have nice eyes, you know?

745
00:51:40.134 --> 00:51:41.927
Do me another favor?

746
00:51:42.929 --> 00:51:45.306
Why don't you take off that hat?

747
00:51:51.603 --> 00:51:53.815
I always knew you was pretty.

748
00:51:55.358 --> 00:51:57.985
- Don't tease me.
- I'm not teasing you.

749
00:52:01.364 --> 00:52:03.157
I ain't teasing you.

750
00:52:04.242 --> 00:52:06.869
I just wanna... I wanna kiss you.

751
00:52:09.496 --> 00:52:12.541
You don't have to kiss me back
if you don't wanna,

752
00:52:12.625 --> 00:52:14.460
but I wanna kiss you.

753
00:53:26.864 --> 00:53:29.911
- Heard you had a fight coming up.
- Next month.

754
00:53:29.994 --> 00:53:31.746
January 27, right?

755
00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:33.748
That's good. Come down to the gym.

756
00:53:33.831 --> 00:53:36.125
We'll get you in shape.
How's your weight?

757
00:53:36.208 --> 00:53:39.085
- 175.
- Hey, Rock. How you doing?

758
00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:41.338
Mick was looking for you up there, man.

759
00:53:41.422 --> 00:53:43.632
- For me? You're sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

760
00:53:43.715 --> 00:53:45.842
He's looking for you.
Get up there and see him.

761
00:53:45.927 --> 00:53:48.346
- He wanted me?
- Yeah. Your name's Rock, right?

762
00:53:48.429 --> 00:53:50.347
- Yeah.
- All right. Go on, babe.

763
00:54:04.652 --> 00:54:06.489
You got something for me?

764
00:54:06.572 --> 00:54:09.409
Yeah, there was some guy
from Miles Jergens looking for you.

765
00:54:09.492 --> 00:54:12.954
They need sparring partners
for Apollo Creed. There's the card.

766
00:54:13.036 --> 00:54:14.746
- When was he here?
- About an hour ago.

767
00:54:14.831 --> 00:54:18.126
They're probably looking
for sparring partners for Creed.

768
00:54:18.208 --> 00:54:20.628
I said that before, you dumb Dago!

769
00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:25.382
I been coming here for six years,
and six years you been sticking it to me.

770
00:54:25.465 --> 00:54:27.969
- How come?
- You don't wanna know!

771
00:54:28.052 --> 00:54:29.804
Yeah, I wanna know how come.

772
00:54:29.887 --> 00:54:31.931
- You wanna know?
- I wanna know now!

773
00:54:32.014 --> 00:54:34.056
Okay, I'm gonna tell you!

774
00:54:34.141 --> 00:54:38.186
You had the talent to become
a good fighter, and instead of that,

775
00:54:38.271 --> 00:54:42.400
you became a leg breaker
for some cheap, second-rate loan shark!

776
00:54:43.318 --> 00:54:44.485
It's a living.

777
00:54:44.568 --> 00:54:46.402
It's a waste of life!

778
00:55:05.005 --> 00:55:06.797
Yes. May I help you?

779
00:55:12.054 --> 00:55:14.599
Oh, you must be Mr. Rocky Balboa.

780
00:55:14.681 --> 00:55:17.518
Mr. Jergens's expecting you.
Just a moment.

781
00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:25.108
Mr. Rocky Balboa to see you, sir.

782
00:55:25.652 --> 00:55:26.777
Fine.

783
00:55:27.527 --> 00:55:30.030
- Please go in, Mr. Balboa.
- Can I have that?

784
00:55:30.114 --> 00:55:32.532
- Oh, certainly.
- Thanks.

785
00:55:37.329 --> 00:55:38.706
Mr. Balboa.

786
00:55:39.456 --> 00:55:41.250
How are you? George Jergens.

787
00:55:41.333 --> 00:55:42.960
Take a chair, please.

788
00:55:43.043 --> 00:55:44.253
Thanks.

789
00:55:46.088 --> 00:55:47.507
Mr. Balboa.

790
00:55:48.047 --> 00:55:49.925
Call me Rocky.

791
00:55:50.009 --> 00:55:52.052
Rocky, you got any representation?

792
00:55:52.135 --> 00:55:53.637
You have a manager?

793
00:55:53.721 --> 00:55:55.139
No, just me.

794
00:55:56.766 --> 00:56:00.561
Rocky, I've got a proposition
I'd like to make to you.

795
00:56:01.018 --> 00:56:04.190
- About sparring?
- Beg your pardon?

796
00:56:04.273 --> 00:56:08.735
I know you're looking for
sparring partners, and I'm very available.

797
00:56:08.945 --> 00:56:10.780
- I'm sure you are.
- Absolutely.

798
00:56:10.862 --> 00:56:12.364
Sparring with the champ
would be an honor,

799
00:56:12.447 --> 00:56:13.699
and you know what, Mr. Jergens?

800
00:56:13.782 --> 00:56:15.659
- What?
- I wouldn't take no cheap shots.

801
00:56:15.742 --> 00:56:17.911
I'd really be a good sparring partner.

802
00:56:17.996 --> 00:56:20.289
You don't understand me, Rocky.

803
00:56:20.706 --> 00:56:22.583
My proposition's this.

804
00:56:23.418 --> 00:56:25.835
Would you be interested
in fighting Apollo Creed

805
00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:28.630
for the world heavyweight championship?

806
00:56:33.219 --> 00:56:34.387
No.

807
00:56:34.469 --> 00:56:36.014
Listen, Rocky.

808
00:56:36.931 --> 00:56:38.931
Apollo's seen you fight.

809
00:56:39.766 --> 00:56:41.393
He likes you.

810
00:56:41.476 --> 00:56:43.228
He wants to fight you.

811
00:56:43.313 --> 00:56:45.106
Well, it's just that, you see,

812
00:56:45.188 --> 00:56:48.318
I fight in clubs, you know,
and I'm really a ham-and-egger.

813
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.277
This guy, he's the best, and

814
00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:53.947
it wouldn't be such a good fight,
but thank you very much.

815
00:56:54.489 --> 00:56:55.907
I appreciate it.

816
00:56:55.992 --> 00:57:00.329
Rocky, do you believe that America
is the land of opportunity?

817
00:57:01.789 --> 00:57:02.873
Yeah.

818
00:57:03.708 --> 00:57:05.418
Apollo Creed does,

819
00:57:05.793 --> 00:57:07.753
and he's gonna prove it to the whole world

820
00:57:07.835 --> 00:57:10.547
by giving an unknown a shot at the title.

821
00:57:11.047 --> 00:57:13.050
And that unknown is you.

822
00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:15.635
He picked you, Rocky.

823
00:57:16.804 --> 00:57:19.097
It's the chance of a lifetime.

824
00:57:20.224 --> 00:57:22.143
You can't pass it by.

825
00:57:23.436 --> 00:57:25.063
What do you say?

826
00:57:30.943 --> 00:57:32.027
<i>All right, fellas. That's enough pictures.</i>

827
00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:33.945
<i>We wanna ask Apollo a few questions.</i>

828
00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:36.574
<i>Apollo, how do you like</i>
<i>the City of Brotherly Love?</i>

829
00:57:36.657 --> 00:57:40.077
<i>Well, just being in Philadelphia</i>
<i>makes me feel patriotic.</i>

830
00:57:40.161 --> 00:57:42.871
<i>Beautiful people in a beautiful city</i>
<i>coming up to me on the street,</i>

831
00:57:42.954 --> 00:57:44.123
<i>wishing me the best.</i>

832
00:57:44.206 --> 00:57:46.958
<i>I love my Philadelphia brothers,</i>
<i>and I'm proud to be an American.</i>

833
00:57:47.043 --> 00:57:48.585
<i>Apollo? Champ?</i>

834
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:52.507
<i>Why did you agree to fight a man</i>
<i>who has virtually no chance of winning?</i>

835
00:57:52.590 --> 00:57:54.884
<i>If history proves one thing,</i>

836
00:57:54.967 --> 00:57:58.721
<i>American history proves that</i>
<i>everybody's got a chance to win.</i>

837
00:57:58.804 --> 00:58:01.931
<i>Didn't you guys ever hear</i>
<i>of Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?</i>

838
00:58:02.016 --> 00:58:03.518
<i>Apollo?</i>

839
00:58:03.601 --> 00:58:06.143
<i>It is a coincidence</i>
<i>that you're fighting a white man</i>

840
00:58:06.228 --> 00:58:08.188
<i>on the most celebrated day</i>
<i>in the country's history?</i>

841
00:58:08.271 --> 00:58:11.483
<i>I don't know. Is it a coincidence</i>
<i>that he's fighting a black man</i>

842
00:58:11.567 --> 00:58:13.902
<i>on the most celebrated day</i>
<i>in the country's history?</i>

843
00:58:13.987 --> 00:58:15.989
<i>- Right on, Apollo!</i>
<i>- Tell the truth, brother!</i>

844
00:58:16.072 --> 00:58:18.657
<i>Listen, Apollo.</i>
<i>How do you feel about your challenger?</i>

845
00:58:18.739 --> 00:58:21.494
<i>How do I feel about him? Come here, Rock.</i>

846
00:58:21.952 --> 00:58:23.286
<i>My main man.</i>

847
00:58:23.371 --> 00:58:26.039
<i>- Rocky, ain't you Italian?</i>
<i>- Yeah, I'm Italian.</i>

848
00:58:26.123 --> 00:58:27.833
<i>Now what does that mean?</i>

849
00:58:27.916 --> 00:58:30.795
<i>That means, if he can't fight,</i>
<i>I'll bet he can cook.</i>

850
00:58:32.505 --> 00:58:35.047
Do me a favor. His lungs, punch out.

851
00:58:35.132 --> 00:58:36.550
Paulie.

852
00:58:36.634 --> 00:58:39.846
<i>Rocky, how do you expect</i>
<i>to fight Apollo Creed?</i>

853
00:58:40.387 --> 00:58:42.639
<i>Oh, jeez, you know, Creed's the best.</i>

854
00:58:42.724 --> 00:58:44.391
<i>I guess I'll have to do the best I can.</i>

855
00:58:44.474 --> 00:58:47.143
<i>Tell me, Rocky, just between us,</i>

856
00:58:47.228 --> 00:58:50.273
<i>where did you get</i>
<i>the name "Italian Stallion"?</i>

857
00:58:50.356 --> 00:58:54.777
<i>Oh, I invented that about eight years ago</i>
<i>when I was eating dinner.</i>

858
00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:59.657
<i>Rocky, now your payday will be $150,000.</i>

859
00:58:59.782 --> 00:59:01.199
<i>Any comment?</i>

860
00:59:03.411 --> 00:59:06.331
<i>- You got no comment, Rocky, right?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

861
00:59:06.414 --> 00:59:07.873
<i>- Thank you, Rocky.</i>
<i>- Wait a minute.</i>

862
00:59:07.956 --> 00:59:10.876
<i>I just wanna say hi to my girlfriend, okay?</i>

863
00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:13.045
<i>Yo, Adrian, it's me, Rocky.</i>

864
00:59:14.172 --> 00:59:16.922
<i>You believe all this?</i>
<i>Microphones and all that stuff.</i>

865
00:59:17.007 --> 00:59:18.134
You didn't.

866
00:59:18.217 --> 00:59:20.552
<i>- Thank you, Rocky.</i>
<i>- Who you pushing, man?</i>

867
00:59:20.635 --> 00:59:22.972
<i>- Smack you in the mouth!</i>
<i>- Thank you, Rocky.</i>

868
00:59:23.056 --> 00:59:24.931
Don't it matter he making you out a fool?

869
00:59:25.016 --> 00:59:26.601
I'd break his lips.

870
00:59:26.726 --> 00:59:30.355
- He's taking cheap shots.
- Don't bother me none.

871
00:59:30.438 --> 00:59:35.275
Yo, Rocky, I guess you'll be looking
for people to help you out.

872
00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:36.652
Help what?

873
00:59:36.735 --> 00:59:37.945
You know,

874
00:59:38.027 --> 00:59:39.947
keep you living the clean life.

875
00:59:40.030 --> 00:59:42.282
I do okay, you know.

876
00:59:42.367 --> 00:59:44.327
You need someone
to help with the exercise

877
00:59:44.409 --> 00:59:48.246
and someone standing by with a towel
or running errands?

878
00:59:48.331 --> 00:59:51.083
Hey, yo, Paulie,
who cared about me yesterday? Nobody.

879
00:59:51.166 --> 00:59:53.753
So I just think I'm gonna train myself,
you know?

880
00:59:53.835 --> 00:59:56.005
Without such good people around
to help you,

881
00:59:56.088 --> 00:59:58.547
you don't have such a good chance.

882
00:59:58.675 --> 01:00:01.260
Einstein flunked out of school twice.

883
01:00:01.594 --> 01:00:02.804
That so?

884
01:00:02.969 --> 01:00:06.849
Yeah. Beethoven was deaf.
Helen Keller was blind.

885
01:00:07.431 --> 01:00:09.851
I think Rocky's got a good chance.

886
01:00:15.565 --> 01:00:17.652
Want me to get you a beer, Paulie?

887
01:00:17.735 --> 01:00:21.489
You looking to do a good deed?
Keep out of my freaking life!

888
01:00:22.407 --> 01:00:24.282
- What'd I do?
- Nothing.

889
01:00:24.367 --> 01:00:25.952
Did I say something wrong?

890
01:00:26.034 --> 01:00:27.786
You didn't say nothing. It's all right.

891
01:00:27.869 --> 01:00:29.871
That's right! You didn't say nothing!

892
01:00:29.956 --> 01:00:31.498
Nothing at all!

893
01:00:33.501 --> 01:00:34.918
I gotta go.

894
01:00:36.085 --> 01:00:38.463
Where are the freaking pretzels?

895
01:00:41.509 --> 01:00:43.469
I'd like to have a pretzel.

896
01:00:43.552 --> 01:00:45.637
Hey, we ain't got any beer?

897
01:00:46.514 --> 01:00:49.684
I thought you were supposed to
pick up some beer!

898
01:00:57.525 --> 01:01:00.152
How'd you like hearing your name
on TV tonight?

899
01:01:01.902 --> 01:01:03.405
I was shocked.

900
01:01:03.489 --> 01:01:04.907
Why'd you do that?

901
01:01:04.989 --> 01:01:06.742
You're putting me on, right?

902
01:01:06.826 --> 01:01:08.202
Absolutely.

903
01:01:08.994 --> 01:01:11.748
- What time should I expect you?
- About 7:00.

904
01:01:11.831 --> 01:01:13.750
- Okay.
- Hey.

905
01:01:31.266 --> 01:01:34.728
You know how I said
that stuff on TV didn't bother me?

906
01:01:35.146 --> 01:01:36.271
Yeah.

907
01:01:38.733 --> 01:01:40.025
It did.

908
01:01:50.661 --> 01:01:54.248
Listen, the reason I brought you here
is because

909
01:01:54.331 --> 01:01:56.668
I wanna know if you got any money
for training expenses.

910
01:01:56.751 --> 01:01:58.503
I got a few dollars.

911
01:01:58.585 --> 01:02:00.838
A few bucks? Here. Put this in your glove.

912
01:02:00.922 --> 01:02:03.965
- What's this?
- $500. Don't worry about it.

913
01:02:05.217 --> 01:02:07.135
You know, you ain't never had any luck,

914
01:02:07.219 --> 01:02:09.722
but I think this time Lady Luck
may be in your corner.

915
01:02:09.806 --> 01:02:12.724
- What do you think?
- Maybe.

916
01:02:12.809 --> 01:02:14.726
Thanks for the money, Tony.

917
01:02:14.811 --> 01:02:17.896
It's okay. Don't worry about it. I'll see you.

918
01:02:18.188 --> 01:02:19.983
- Wait a minute.
- What?

919
01:02:20.065 --> 01:02:22.193
You're in training. Come on.

920
01:02:30.326 --> 01:02:31.952
- Yo, Tony.
- What?

921
01:02:32.869 --> 01:02:35.081
You gonna show up at the fight?

922
01:02:35.164 --> 01:02:36.456
Ringside.

923
01:02:38.876 --> 01:02:40.378
I'll see you.

924
01:03:15.621 --> 01:03:16.748
Yeah.

925
01:03:22.253 --> 01:03:25.757
Hello, kid. I seen your light. Can I come in?

926
01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:28.134
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah. Good.

927
01:03:28.217 --> 01:03:30.302
Hey, it's a nice place here.

928
01:03:31.137 --> 01:03:33.931
Anyway, what I come to tell you is that,

929
01:03:35.306 --> 01:03:38.561
that what happened to you is freak luck.

930
01:03:38.643 --> 01:03:40.563
- Yeah, freak luck.
- Ain't it true?

931
01:03:40.646 --> 01:03:43.148
Look at the other guys.
They're good fighters, right?

932
01:03:43.231 --> 01:03:45.943
They're colorful. They got good records.

933
01:03:46.027 --> 01:03:48.320
They fight their guts out for peanuts.

934
01:03:48.402 --> 01:03:52.367
But you, you got a shot at the title!

935
01:03:52.449 --> 01:03:54.911
Freak luck is a strange thing, you know?

936
01:03:54.994 --> 01:03:57.496
- Sure is. Can I sit down?
- Yeah, sure.

937
01:03:59.123 --> 01:04:02.210
- What the hell are those?
- Domestic turtles.

938
01:04:02.293 --> 01:04:04.835
The one on the top is Cuff
and the other guy's Link.

939
01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.130
The rest are marbles.

940
01:04:06.213 --> 01:04:08.547
Yeah? They make good soup.

941
01:04:09.257 --> 01:04:10.467
Anyway.

942
01:04:10.550 --> 01:04:13.429
Look, I'm here to warn you.

943
01:04:13.512 --> 01:04:18.016
You gotta be very careful
about this shot that you got at the title.

944
01:04:18.101 --> 01:04:20.893
Because, like the Bible says,

945
01:04:20.978 --> 01:04:23.146
you ain't gonna get a second chance.

946
01:04:23.231 --> 01:04:25.358
Yeah. All right.

947
01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:27.360
You thought of that, huh?

948
01:04:27.443 --> 01:04:30.862
Well, what you need is a manager.

949
01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:33.864
A manager. Listen to me.

950
01:04:33.949 --> 01:04:37.704
I know, because I been in this racket
for 50 years.

951
01:04:37.786 --> 01:04:41.039
- 50 years, huh?
- 50 years. I've seen it all.

952
01:04:41.123 --> 01:04:44.460
- All of it. You know what I done?
- What?

953
01:04:44.543 --> 01:04:46.545
I have done it all.

954
01:04:46.628 --> 01:04:50.382
You should've seen me when I knocked
that guinea Russo out of the ring.

955
01:04:50.465 --> 01:04:52.385
Out of the goddamn ring, I tell you.

956
01:04:52.467 --> 01:04:54.512
September 14, 1923,

957
01:04:54.594 --> 01:04:58.931
and it was the same night
that Firpo knocks Dempsey out of the ring.

958
01:04:59.016 --> 01:05:01.393
So who gets the publicity? Figure that out.

959
01:05:01.476 --> 01:05:03.396
- Dempsey.
- That's right. But why?

960
01:05:03.478 --> 01:05:07.317
- 'Cause he was champ.
- No! Because he had a manager.

961
01:05:07.483 --> 01:05:09.027
I had nothing.

962
01:05:10.402 --> 01:05:12.905
I wanna show you something.
I want you to look at my face.

963
01:05:12.989 --> 01:05:16.284
Look at this.
I got 21 stitches over this left eye.

964
01:05:16.367 --> 01:05:18.827
I got 34 stitches over this eye.

965
01:05:18.911 --> 01:05:22.331
You know I had my nose busted 17 times.

966
01:05:22.414 --> 01:05:27.003
The last time
was in that fight with Sailor Mike.

967
01:05:27.085 --> 01:05:30.005
I got that clipping here.
It was a good fight.

968
01:05:30.088 --> 01:05:32.007
Wanna read that?

969
01:05:32.090 --> 01:05:34.217
Well, it doesn't matter.

970
01:05:34.302 --> 01:05:37.764
Anyway, he put this vegetation on my ear.

971
01:05:43.268 --> 01:05:47.190
You kind of remind me of the Rock,
you know that?

972
01:05:47.273 --> 01:05:49.317
- You really think so?
- That's right.

973
01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.777
You move like him,
and you got heart like he did.

974
01:05:52.862 --> 01:05:56.449
Yeah, I got heart,
but I ain't got no locker, do I, Mick?

975
01:06:00.286 --> 01:06:02.038
Anyway.

976
01:06:02.121 --> 01:06:05.208
You know, when I begun
in this business, kid...

977
01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:11.463
I wanna make a suggestion.
Don't drink that piss before a fight.

978
01:06:11.547 --> 01:06:13.675
It's no good for you.

979
01:06:14.342 --> 01:06:16.135
If you don't mind my saying.

980
01:06:16.219 --> 01:06:18.471
Anyway, you know,
when I started in this racket,

981
01:06:18.554 --> 01:06:20.764
pugs like us, we was treated like dogs.

982
01:06:20.847 --> 01:06:23.266
For $10, you got to
tear somebody's throat out.

983
01:06:23.351 --> 01:06:25.603
But I never had no management.

984
01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:29.983
One time, this son of a bitch that I fought,

985
01:06:30.065 --> 01:06:31.985
he put a nail right there.

986
01:06:32.068 --> 01:06:34.402
- In his thumb.
- In the thumb of the glove.

987
01:06:34.487 --> 01:06:39.617
He punched so many holes in my face,
I had spit shooting out of my cheeks.

988
01:06:40.159 --> 01:06:41.994
Can you imagine that?

989
01:06:42.077 --> 01:06:45.623
Anyway, when I tell you what I looked like
when I was in my prime.

990
01:06:45.706 --> 01:06:47.458
I want you to look at something.

991
01:06:47.541 --> 01:06:50.168
Look at that. That's the way I looked

992
01:06:51.085 --> 01:06:53.213
before these guys got at me.

993
01:06:53.297 --> 01:06:57.050
That's nice. You didn't take very good care
of the picture, though.

994
01:06:57.135 --> 01:07:00.346
Well, I never had no management.

995
01:07:00.429 --> 01:07:02.681
That's the trouble,
but now I got all this knowledge.

996
01:07:02.764 --> 01:07:05.518
I got it up here.
Now I wanna give it to you.

997
01:07:05.601 --> 01:07:08.271
I wanna give you this knowledge.
I wanna take care of you.

998
01:07:08.353 --> 01:07:11.565
I wanna make sure that what happened
to me doesn't happen to you.

999
01:07:11.648 --> 01:07:13.443
You know what I mean?

1000
01:07:13.525 --> 01:07:15.360
Mick, the fight's set.

1001
01:07:15.445 --> 01:07:18.030
Listen to me. I wanna be your manager.

1002
01:07:18.114 --> 01:07:19.532
You follow that?

1003
01:07:19.614 --> 01:07:21.826
Fight's set. I don't need no manager.

1004
01:07:21.909 --> 01:07:24.244
But you can't buy
what I'm gonna give you.

1005
01:07:24.329 --> 01:07:26.706
I got pain and I got experience.

1006
01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:29.333
I got pain and I got experience too.

1007
01:07:30.043 --> 01:07:31.460
Listen, kid.

1008
01:07:31.668 --> 01:07:33.210
Hey, Mick.

1009
01:07:33.295 --> 01:07:35.882
I needed your help
about 10 years ago, right?

1010
01:07:35.965 --> 01:07:38.967
Ten years ago. You never helped me none.
You didn't care.

1011
01:07:39.052 --> 01:07:40.887
If you wanted help...

1012
01:07:41.512 --> 01:07:45.556
I say, if you wanted help,
why didn't you just ask me, kid?

1013
01:07:45.641 --> 01:07:48.226
I asked, but you never heard nothing!

1014
01:07:49.143 --> 01:07:50.521
Well, I...

1015
01:07:53.775 --> 01:07:55.150
I know I...

1016
01:07:55.233 --> 01:07:56.902
I'm 76 years old.

1017
01:08:01.614 --> 01:08:02.824
And...

1018
01:08:38.319 --> 01:08:40.779
Took you long enough to get here.

1019
01:08:41.488 --> 01:08:43.698
Took 10 years to come to my house.

1020
01:08:43.783 --> 01:08:45.783
You don't like my house?

1021
01:08:46.493 --> 01:08:48.078
My house stink?

1022
01:08:49.203 --> 01:08:51.205
That's right, it stinks!

1023
01:08:51.288 --> 01:08:53.626
I didn't ask no favors from you!

1024
01:08:56.712 --> 01:08:58.546
Talk about your prime.

1025
01:08:59.046 --> 01:09:00.966
What about my prime, Mick?

1026
01:09:01.216 --> 01:09:03.176
At least you had a prime!

1027
01:09:03.926 --> 01:09:06.139
I ain't had no prime. I ain't had nothing.

1028
01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:09.180
Legs are going, everything is going.
Nobody's giving me nothing.

1029
01:09:09.265 --> 01:09:11.475
Guy comes up, offers me a fight. Big deal.

1030
01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:14.020
Wanna fight the fight?
Yeah, I'll fight the big fight.

1031
01:09:14.104 --> 01:09:17.692
I'm gonna go fight that big fight
and I'm gonna get that!

1032
01:09:18.109 --> 01:09:19.859
I'm gonna get that!

1033
01:09:21.069 --> 01:09:23.197
And you wanna be ringside and see?

1034
01:09:23.279 --> 01:09:25.323
Do you? You wanna help me out?

1035
01:09:25.408 --> 01:09:28.161
Do you wanna see me
get my face kicked in?

1036
01:09:28.243 --> 01:09:30.246
Legs ain't working, nothing's working.

1037
01:09:30.328 --> 01:09:32.787
Think I'll go and fight the champ.

1038
01:09:33.247 --> 01:09:35.042
Yeah, I'll fight him.

1039
01:09:37.462 --> 01:09:39.337
Get my face kicked in.

1040
01:09:40.212 --> 01:09:42.800
And you come around here.
You wanna move in with me?

1041
01:09:42.884 --> 01:09:45.094
Come on in. It's a nice house!

1042
01:09:45.676 --> 01:09:48.430
Real nice! Come on in! It stinks!

1043
01:09:49.724 --> 01:09:51.725
This whole place stinks.

1044
01:09:52.185 --> 01:09:54.060
You wanna help me out?

1045
01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:58.274
Well, help me out! Come on. Help me out.
I'm standing here!

1046
01:10:58.001 --> 01:11:01.045
<i>It's only about 28 degrees.</i>
<i>We'll check that forecast.</i>

1047
01:11:01.127 --> 01:11:04.046
<i>I feel very mischievous, very weird, very...</i>

1048
01:11:05.381 --> 01:11:07.635
<i>I got vinyl seats in my car.</i>

1049
01:11:07.719 --> 01:11:10.805
<i>When I hit those seats this morning,</i>
<i>I just went, "Whoo!"</i>

1050
01:11:10.886 --> 01:11:15.143
<i>I figure if I'm up, everybody</i>
<i>in the Delaware Valley should be up.</i>

1051
01:11:15.225 --> 01:11:16.560
<i>You agree with me?</i>

1052
01:11:16.644 --> 01:11:20.479
<i>At three minutes past 4:00 in the morning,</i>
<i>what else you gonna do?</i>

1053
01:11:21.983 --> 01:11:23.149
<i>Hello?</i>

1054
01:11:23.234 --> 01:11:26.779
<i>Good morning, Mrs. Kramer.</i>
<i>This is Don Cabot, WYBG Philadelphia?</i>

1055
01:11:26.863 --> 01:11:29.113
<i>- How are you this morning?</i>
<i>- What?</i>

1056
01:11:29.198 --> 01:11:33.077
<i>You have a lot of nerve</i>
<i>calling me at this hour of the morning!</i>

1057
01:11:33.161 --> 01:11:34.453
<i>Good-bye!</i>

1058
01:11:47.631 --> 01:11:50.301
<i>Me and Mrs. Kramer are up,</i>
<i>and it's a good morning.</i>

1059
01:11:50.386 --> 01:11:53.014
<i>I tell you, I need someone</i>
<i>to snuggle with. 28 degrees.</i>

1060
01:11:53.095 --> 01:11:55.140
<i>It's cold out there. We deserve it.</i>

1061
01:11:55.224 --> 01:11:57.685
<i>We've been getting away with murder</i>
<i>the last couple of weeks.</i>

1062
01:11:57.769 --> 01:11:59.854
<i>Our high today could be...</i>

1063
01:11:59.935 --> 01:12:02.814
<i>Tonight we're back down</i>
<i>in the 20-degree range.</i>

1064
01:12:02.899 --> 01:12:04.399
<i>A little colder in the suburbs.</i>

1065
01:12:04.484 --> 01:12:07.694
<i>Tomorrow, with a little bit of luck,</i>
<i>we may hit 40.</i>

1066
01:12:07.779 --> 01:12:09.697
<i>But it's 28. It's awfully chilly.</i>

1067
01:12:09.779 --> 01:12:12.533
<i>Make sure you have it bundled up</i>
<i>before you bring it out.</i>

1068
01:14:34.676 --> 01:14:35.926
Come on.

1069
01:14:36.886 --> 01:14:39.470
It stinks in here, you know?

1070
01:14:39.555 --> 01:14:41.349
Yeah. I know.

1071
01:14:43.184 --> 01:14:45.395
Did you kill all these things?

1072
01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:47.939
No, across the street.

1073
01:14:49.899 --> 01:14:52.694
It's like an animal morgue.

1074
01:14:53.194 --> 01:14:55.029
It's a little cold in here, ain't it?

1075
01:14:55.113 --> 01:14:56.197
Yeah.

1076
01:15:00.702 --> 01:15:02.868
Who killed all these things?

1077
01:15:03.371 --> 01:15:05.037
Are you crazy, Paulie?

1078
01:15:05.122 --> 01:15:07.375
If you don't pay Gazzo,
you end up on a hook.

1079
01:15:07.457 --> 01:15:09.627
Gazzo's a good man. You know that.

1080
01:15:09.711 --> 01:15:11.502
Don't get excited. I know that.

1081
01:15:11.587 --> 01:15:15.506
That's why I wanted you to talk to him
about me and the collecting job.

1082
01:15:15.591 --> 01:15:18.094
And can get me out of
this stinking freezer.

1083
01:15:18.176 --> 01:15:22.180
Why don't you do yourself a favor?
Keep this job. You eat better.

1084
01:15:23.555 --> 01:15:24.640
Moo.

1085
01:15:25.225 --> 01:15:27.353
Does it ever snow in here?

1086
01:15:28.104 --> 01:15:32.317
You and my sister,
how you getting along together?

1087
01:15:33.234 --> 01:15:34.902
How do you think?

1088
01:15:35.444 --> 01:15:38.072
I'm not sure, Rock. What's the story?

1089
01:15:39.073 --> 01:15:40.448
About what?

1090
01:15:40.698 --> 01:15:42.368
What's happening?

1091
01:15:43.202 --> 01:15:44.912
You really like her?

1092
01:15:44.996 --> 01:15:46.622
Sure, I like her.

1093
01:15:48.707 --> 01:15:51.377
I don't see it. What's the attraction?

1094
01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:55.212
I don't know. Fills gaps, I guess.

1095
01:15:55.921 --> 01:15:57.425
What's "gaps"?

1096
01:15:57.759 --> 01:16:01.761
I don't know. She's got gaps.
I got gaps. Together we fill gaps.

1097
01:16:04.265 --> 01:16:05.890
You balling her?

1098
01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:10.770
You don't talk dirty about your sister.

1099
01:16:12.604 --> 01:16:14.774
Are you screwing my sister?

1100
01:16:17.234 --> 01:16:20.698
You see?
That's why I can't connect you with Gazzo.

1101
01:16:20.782 --> 01:16:24.118
Because you got a big mouth.
You just talk too much.

1102
01:16:25.118 --> 01:16:28.037
- It's cold in here. I'm going home.
- Cold in here?

1103
01:16:28.122 --> 01:16:29.707
It is cold in here!

1104
01:16:29.791 --> 01:16:32.210
It stinks in here, and you stink!

1105
01:17:00.779 --> 01:17:02.823
You're breaking the ribs.

1106
01:17:22.176 --> 01:17:26.220
If you do that to Apollo Creed,
they'll put us in jail for murder.

1107
01:17:28.015 --> 01:17:30.600
I'll see you tomorrow morning, okay?

1108
01:17:43.323 --> 01:17:45.573
- I turned the heat up.
- Thanks.

1109
01:17:45.992 --> 01:17:49.912
Your brother's a good man,
but he's awful pushy, you know?

1110
01:18:00.212 --> 01:18:03.259
- You want me to rub you down?
- No, I'm just sore, okay?

1111
01:18:03.341 --> 01:18:05.595
- I'm gonna just sit here.
- You sure?

1112
01:18:05.676 --> 01:18:07.095
Yeah, I'm sure.

1113
01:18:10.765 --> 01:18:13.645
Hey, come on. No fooling around, all right?

1114
01:18:13.978 --> 01:18:15.313
I'm tired.

1115
01:18:16.229 --> 01:18:18.147
Adrian, I'm serious now.

1116
01:18:18.231 --> 01:18:20.109
There's no fooling around during training.

1117
01:18:20.193 --> 01:18:21.944
I wanna stay strong.

1118
01:18:22.278 --> 01:18:25.113
- You're not kidding.
- No, I ain't kidding.

1119
01:18:28.117 --> 01:18:30.078
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1120
01:18:30.161 --> 01:18:32.872
Why don't you just make the meat, okay?

1121
01:18:34.747 --> 01:18:36.751
Okay, I'll make the meat.

1122
01:19:03.359 --> 01:19:05.279
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

1123
01:19:37.979 --> 01:19:40.939
Underneath! Underneath!
Knock him out! Come on!

1124
01:19:41.024 --> 01:19:43.109
Hold it. Hold it, Rock!

1125
01:19:43.192 --> 01:19:47.194
You're driving me crazy. You're so sloppy
because you're off balance.

1126
01:19:47.279 --> 01:19:49.198
Let's try this. Take this string.

1127
01:19:49.282 --> 01:19:50.867
Tie it to both ankles.

1128
01:19:50.948 --> 01:19:54.037
- Leave about two feet of slack.
- I never had good footwork.

1129
01:19:54.118 --> 01:19:56.706
Never mind footwork.
Now you're all balanced.

1130
01:19:56.787 --> 01:19:59.292
Marciano had the same problem

1131
01:19:59.375 --> 01:20:01.542
and this string cured it.

1132
01:20:02.045 --> 01:20:06.966
If you can move and hit without
breaking the string, you got balance!

1133
01:20:07.050 --> 01:20:09.344
You become a dangerous person.

1134
01:20:09.426 --> 01:20:11.386
- You follow me?
- Looking good, Rock.

1135
01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:13.514
- Thanks.
- Let's go. That's it.

1136
01:20:13.595 --> 01:20:15.515
- Underneath it.
- Hey, Rock.

1137
01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:17.685
- What?
- How about an autograph?

1138
01:20:17.769 --> 01:20:19.185
Get out of here!

1139
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:22.064
Don't interrupt me
while I'm conducting business.

1140
01:20:22.148 --> 01:20:24.399
Move your little chicken asses out.

1141
01:20:24.484 --> 01:20:28.694
Hey, listen, kid.
You lay off that pet shop dame.

1142
01:20:29.113 --> 01:20:31.488
Women weaken legs.

1143
01:20:32.742 --> 01:20:35.036
Yeah, but I really like this girl, you know?

1144
01:20:35.118 --> 01:20:37.037
Then let her train you!

1145
01:20:39.666 --> 01:20:41.626
Okay, no more fooling around.

1146
01:20:41.707 --> 01:20:43.377
Okay. Now hit it.

1147
01:20:45.046 --> 01:20:47.296
Women weaken legs, huh?

1148
01:20:51.886 --> 01:20:53.429
- Yo, Rock.
- Yo, Rocky.

1149
01:21:04.064 --> 01:21:05.608
You look great.

1150
01:21:06.734 --> 01:21:08.569
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

1151
01:21:08.778 --> 01:21:11.279
Terrific. I mean, you could be a heartbreak.

1152
01:21:11.363 --> 01:21:14.158
You'll walk down the street
breaking hearts the way you're looking.

1153
01:21:14.242 --> 01:21:15.326
Very sharp.

1154
01:21:15.908 --> 01:21:17.996
I got another surprise for you.

1155
01:21:18.078 --> 01:21:19.247
What?

1156
01:21:19.872 --> 01:21:22.417
Butkus! Hey, Butkus.

1157
01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:24.417
Come here, kid.

1158
01:21:24.502 --> 01:21:26.877
To keep you company when you run.

1159
01:21:31.884 --> 01:21:34.886
Come in and meet the family.
The owner never come back?

1160
01:21:34.970 --> 01:21:36.930
Gloria says he's yours if you want him.

1161
01:21:37.015 --> 01:21:39.725
Do I want him? What's he eat?

1162
01:21:39.809 --> 01:21:41.685
He eats little turtles.

1163
01:22:06.377 --> 01:22:08.087
What's that, Butkus?

1164
01:22:08.171 --> 01:22:10.131
Whose truck is this? Come on.

1165
01:22:12.591 --> 01:22:15.176
One call from me, you're a celebrity.

1166
01:22:17.305 --> 01:22:18.763
You got... Need exposure.

1167
01:22:18.847 --> 01:22:21.100
- Don't breathe on me.
- That's the big time.

1168
01:22:21.184 --> 01:22:22.810
Don't I know about these things?

1169
01:22:22.894 --> 01:22:25.063
You don't know nothing.
What do they want from me?

1170
01:22:25.145 --> 01:22:26.814
To watch you train.

1171
01:22:26.898 --> 01:22:29.609
What is the matter with you?
This is supposed to be private.

1172
01:22:29.692 --> 01:22:32.109
- I'm doing you a favor.
- You ain't doing me no favors!

1173
01:22:32.194 --> 01:22:34.113
You're embarrassing me
in front of everybody.

1174
01:22:34.197 --> 01:22:36.157
You'll make me look bad
in front of your sis...

1175
01:22:36.238 --> 01:22:38.533
See this cigar?
I'm gonna stick it in your ear.

1176
01:22:38.618 --> 01:22:41.746
Don't do these things to me.
You should've called me.

1177
01:22:41.828 --> 01:22:44.162
Leave a message. Don't do that.

1178
01:22:44.832 --> 01:22:46.957
My sister really likes you.

1179
01:22:48.252 --> 01:22:50.505
I'm gonna kill you one of these days!

1180
01:22:50.587 --> 01:22:51.837
Come on.

1181
01:22:51.921 --> 01:22:53.631
- Baby!
- Baby.

1182
01:22:54.256 --> 01:22:57.970
Here he is, the next heavyweight
champion of the world, Rocky Balboa!

1183
01:22:58.054 --> 01:22:59.970
Hello there. Rocky Balboa.

1184
01:23:00.055 --> 01:23:01.973
We wanna get a brief interview with you.

1185
01:23:02.056 --> 01:23:03.893
- What about me?
- What about you?

1186
01:23:03.975 --> 01:23:06.310
- I'm in charge of the meat.
- Fine. Stand behind it.

1187
01:23:06.395 --> 01:23:08.398
Settle yourself down. Relax.

1188
01:23:08.479 --> 01:23:11.359
What we're going to do
is ask you a few questions.

1189
01:23:11.442 --> 01:23:13.987
Just a few questions
about your unique training method.

1190
01:23:14.069 --> 01:23:15.863
Talk to the folks at home.

1191
01:23:15.947 --> 01:23:17.988
They really wanna know
how you got into this.

1192
01:23:18.073 --> 01:23:20.702
This isn't an everyday thing.
Jimmy, you guys ready?

1193
01:23:20.783 --> 01:23:22.912
Let's roll it. Rocky, turn around here.

1194
01:23:22.996 --> 01:23:24.872
Just don't take no cheap shots, you know?

1195
01:23:24.956 --> 01:23:26.872
No, I won't do that. Just relax.

1196
01:23:26.957 --> 01:23:30.420
Today we're here with
heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.

1197
01:23:30.502 --> 01:23:34.756
- The reason we're standing in this...
- The meat guy's sticking his face in.

1198
01:23:34.841 --> 01:23:36.884
Let's try it again, Rocky.

1199
01:23:37.719 --> 01:23:40.805
<i>Today we're here with</i>
<i>heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.</i>

1200
01:23:40.886 --> 01:23:43.430
<i>The reason we're standing</i>
<i>in this refrigerated box</i>

1201
01:23:43.515 --> 01:23:46.728
<i>is that Mr. Balboa</i>
<i>has an unusual method of training.</i>

1202
01:23:46.810 --> 01:23:50.273
<i>In a moment, he'll demonstrate that</i>
<i>for the viewing audience at home.</i>

1203
01:23:50.354 --> 01:23:53.943
<i>But first, Rocky,</i>
<i>how did you come to train in an icebox?</i>

1204
01:23:54.569 --> 01:23:57.404
<i>Well, my friend, the guy over there,</i>

1205
01:23:57.488 --> 01:24:00.323
<i>he let me in one day,</i>
<i>and I hit the beef here and liked it,</i>

1206
01:24:00.408 --> 01:24:03.786
<i>and since I've become a challenger,</i>
<i>the owner don't mind that I come in.</i>

1207
01:24:03.868 --> 01:24:07.747
<i>Is this a common training method?</i>
<i>Do other fighters pound raw meat?</i>

1208
01:24:07.832 --> 01:24:09.792
<i>No, I think I invented it.</i>

1209
01:24:09.876 --> 01:24:12.627
<i>- Would you give us a demonstration?</i>
- Confirm the reservation

1210
01:24:12.712 --> 01:24:16.131
for my people at ringside,
and fly my barber to Philly.

1211
01:24:19.594 --> 01:24:22.639
How much is being channeled
into West Coast closed-circuit advertising?

1212
01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:24.974
- 300,000.
- Make it 450.

1213
01:24:25.055 --> 01:24:27.475
And send the mayor's wife
200 roses from me,

1214
01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:30.313
and make sure we get a picture of it
for all the newspapers.

1215
01:24:30.395 --> 01:24:33.483
Do you want to run the 15 radio spots
in the Midwest?

1216
01:24:33.564 --> 01:24:36.152
You can spend your money better
in Canadian publicity.

1217
01:24:36.234 --> 01:24:38.944
By the way, Apollo,
I've got friends in Toronto

1218
01:24:39.029 --> 01:24:40.988
who can get you a good tax break.

1219
01:24:41.073 --> 01:24:43.201
George, I like your friends.

1220
01:24:51.167 --> 01:24:55.587
Hey, Champ. You ought to come
look at this boy you're gonna fight on TV.

1221
01:24:56.255 --> 01:24:59.466
- Looks like he means business.
- Yeah, I mean business too.

1222
01:24:59.550 --> 01:25:01.676
Shirley, we got any more coffee out there?

1223
01:25:01.761 --> 01:25:04.389
Certainly, Mr. Creed.
I'll get you some right away.

1224
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:07.684
After the fight,
I may retire and run for emperor.

1225
01:25:22.198 --> 01:25:24.533
<i>Diana Lewis in the meat house</i>

1226
01:25:24.617 --> 01:25:27.078
<i>with southpaw Rocky Balboa.</i>

1227
01:26:13.582 --> 01:26:15.542
And he called the reporters?

1228
01:26:15.626 --> 01:26:18.212
Yeah. Threw my training schedule off.

1229
01:26:18.296 --> 01:26:20.421
Don't be mad at him. He's trying to help.

1230
01:26:20.506 --> 01:26:22.300
Adrian, I ain't mad,

1231
01:26:22.381 --> 01:26:25.595
it's just that when reporters are
around, I get out of joint

1232
01:26:25.676 --> 01:26:28.970
'cause they take cheap shots,
and Paulie knows that.

1233
01:26:29.265 --> 01:26:32.393
And Paulie keeps asking me
for a job all the time

1234
01:26:32.475 --> 01:26:35.229
but he don't know nothing about fighting.

1235
01:26:35.313 --> 01:26:37.774
Are you gonna say anything to him?

1236
01:26:38.564 --> 01:26:42.028
What's to say?
I just don't know what he wants from me.

1237
01:26:44.279 --> 01:26:46.532
I don't want nothing from you.

1238
01:26:47.283 --> 01:26:49.577
I don't want nothing from you.

1239
01:26:50.453 --> 01:26:54.287
This ain't no charity case.
Get out of my house.

1240
01:26:54.372 --> 01:26:56.376
It's not just your house.

1241
01:26:57.335 --> 01:26:59.337
You're no friend no more.

1242
01:26:59.712 --> 01:27:02.796
- Get out of my house, I just says.
- Don't talk to him like that.

1243
01:27:02.881 --> 01:27:05.176
Both of you get out of my house!

1244
01:27:07.176 --> 01:27:09.220
It's cold outside, Paulie.

1245
01:27:19.229 --> 01:27:21.317
I don't want you messing her

1246
01:27:21.399 --> 01:27:23.987
and I don't raise you
to go with this scum bum!

1247
01:27:24.069 --> 01:27:25.822
Yeah? Come on! You wanna hit on me?

1248
01:27:25.904 --> 01:27:29.742
Come on! I'll break both your arms
so they don't work for you.

1249
01:27:32.078 --> 01:27:33.162
Stop it!

1250
01:27:33.246 --> 01:27:36.541
I'm not good enough to meet with Gazzo?
That's what I think of Gazzo!

1251
01:27:36.622 --> 01:27:41.170
Now you're a big shot fighter, you
don't even throw a crumb to your friend.

1252
01:27:41.252 --> 01:27:43.506
When I go and get your meat
every morning!

1253
01:27:43.587 --> 01:27:46.091
You forgot that?
And then I even give you my sister too!

1254
01:27:46.175 --> 01:27:48.801
- Only a pig would say that!
- I'm a pig?

1255
01:27:49.554 --> 01:27:51.555
A pig gets you the best?

1256
01:27:52.345 --> 01:27:55.560
You're such a loser!
I don't get married because of you!

1257
01:27:55.935 --> 01:27:58.060
You can't live by yourself!

1258
01:27:58.479 --> 01:28:02.149
I put you two together,
and don't you forget it!

1259
01:28:02.233 --> 01:28:03.609
You owe me!

1260
01:28:06.112 --> 01:28:08.238
- You owe me!
- What do I owe you?

1261
01:28:08.323 --> 01:28:10.742
You're supposed to be good to me!

1262
01:28:10.823 --> 01:28:14.368
What do I owe you, Paulie?

1263
01:28:14.453 --> 01:28:16.037
I treat you good!

1264
01:28:16.122 --> 01:28:19.542
I cook for you, I clean for you,
I pick up your dirty clothes!

1265
01:28:19.625 --> 01:28:22.877
I take care of you, Paulie!
I don't owe you nothing!

1266
01:28:23.627 --> 01:28:26.090
And you made me feel like a loser!

1267
01:28:27.216 --> 01:28:28.926
I'm not a loser!

1268
01:28:29.010 --> 01:28:30.845
- You're busted!
- What?

1269
01:28:30.926 --> 01:28:32.720
You're not a virgin!

1270
01:28:33.139 --> 01:28:35.430
You let a man take down your pants!

1271
01:28:35.515 --> 01:28:36.975
She's busted!

1272
01:28:40.063 --> 01:28:42.148
I can't haul meat no more!

1273
01:29:12.595 --> 01:29:14.389
You want a roommate?

1274
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:20.685
Absolutely.

1275
01:29:22.563 --> 01:29:24.854
Okay, now when you walk into the ring

1276
01:29:24.939 --> 01:29:27.694
with the number one
heavyweight of the world

1277
01:29:27.777 --> 01:29:29.444
you'll be ready, won't you?

1278
01:29:29.529 --> 01:29:32.948
Why? Because I waited for 50 years

1279
01:29:33.032 --> 01:29:34.658
to make you ready.

1280
01:29:34.742 --> 01:29:37.161
You'll be able to spit nails, kid!

1281
01:29:37.243 --> 01:29:39.872
Like the guy says,
you're gonna eat lightning

1282
01:29:39.956 --> 01:29:41.832
and you're gonna crap thunder!

1283
01:29:41.916 --> 01:29:44.667
You're gonna become
a very dangerous person.

1284
01:29:44.752 --> 01:29:46.045
Yo, Mickey.

1285
01:29:46.127 --> 01:29:48.212
Hey, how are you? Oh, Rock.

1286
01:29:48.296 --> 01:29:51.384
I want you to meet our cut man here.
Al Salvani.

1287
01:29:51.466 --> 01:29:53.469
- Take a look at his eye.
- How you doing, Al?

1288
01:29:53.551 --> 01:29:55.970
- That's right.
- It ain't bad. Seen worse.

1289
01:29:56.055 --> 01:29:58.847
- You ain't so bad yourself.
- Cover up. Things will be okay.

1290
01:29:58.930 --> 01:30:00.143
You cover up.

1291
01:30:00.225 --> 01:30:01.978
Go and take a shower.

1292
01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:04.479
Okay, Mick. I'll see you tomorrow.

1293
01:30:05.479 --> 01:30:08.609
You covered that Whitmore fight?

1294
01:30:08.693 --> 01:30:11.444
- That's why he won.
- Listen. We got a winner here.

1295
01:30:11.529 --> 01:30:15.573
We got a chance. He goes to the body
like nobody you've ever seen.

1296
01:30:15.658 --> 01:30:18.493
You just stand by. We're gonna win.

1297
01:30:25.501 --> 01:30:28.002
Hey, Rock. It's okay I talk to you?

1298
01:30:28.587 --> 01:30:31.341
Okay you talk to me? Sure.

1299
01:30:32.131 --> 01:30:35.011
I figured some angle
to make some money off your name.

1300
01:30:35.094 --> 01:30:37.720
My name? How's that?

1301
01:30:37.889 --> 01:30:40.515
Advertising. I know about that stuff.

1302
01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:44.854
What do you know about advertising?

1303
01:30:48.149 --> 01:30:51.069
Hey, you can make money off my name,
make it, okay?

1304
01:30:51.152 --> 01:30:53.154
I'm gonna take a shower.

1305
01:30:54.113 --> 01:30:56.658
- Wanna help me off with these?
- Sure.

1306
01:32:31.961 --> 01:32:33.837
You're gonna kill him!

1307
01:35:24.716 --> 01:35:28.220
Rocky. What brings you here tonight?

1308
01:35:29.805 --> 01:35:31.765
Mr. Jergens, the poster's wrong.

1309
01:35:32.305 --> 01:35:33.975
What do you mean?

1310
01:35:34.143 --> 01:35:36.979
I'm wearing white pants with a red stripe.

1311
01:35:40.817 --> 01:35:43.234
It doesn't really matter, does it?

1312
01:35:43.319 --> 01:35:46.154
I'm sure you're gonna give us
a great show.

1313
01:35:47.154 --> 01:35:49.242
Try to get some rest, kid.

1314
01:35:50.076 --> 01:35:51.452
Good night.

1315
01:37:22.792 --> 01:37:24.337
I can't do it.

1316
01:37:27.421 --> 01:37:28.506
What?

1317
01:37:29.634 --> 01:37:31.260
I can't beat him.

1318
01:37:32.845 --> 01:37:34.095
Apollo?

1319
01:37:34.805 --> 01:37:35.974
Yeah.

1320
01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:40.310
I been out there, walking around, thinking.

1321
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:45.483
Who am I kidding?
I ain't even in the guy's league.

1322
01:37:50.863 --> 01:37:52.698
What are we gonna do?

1323
01:38:04.292 --> 01:38:05.712
I don't know.

1324
01:38:12.091 --> 01:38:13.845
You worked so hard.

1325
01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:18.930
Yeah, it don't matter,
'cause I was nobody before.

1326
01:38:21.269 --> 01:38:22.854
Don't say that.

1327
01:38:23.563 --> 01:38:25.854
Oh, come on, Adrian. It's true.

1328
01:38:25.939 --> 01:38:27.442
I was nobody.

1329
01:38:29.359 --> 01:38:32.029
But that don't matter either, you know?

1330
01:38:33.072 --> 01:38:34.988
'Cause I was thinking,

1331
01:38:36.242 --> 01:38:39.162
it really don't matter if I lose this fight.

1332
01:38:41.247 --> 01:38:44.832
It really don't matter
if this guy opens my head either.

1333
01:38:46.127 --> 01:38:48.921
'Cause all I wanna do is go the distance.

1334
01:38:53.841 --> 01:38:56.720
Nobody's ever gone the distance
with Creed,

1335
01:38:57.555 --> 01:38:59.805
and if I can go that distance,

1336
01:39:01.225 --> 01:39:04.228
and that bell rings, and I'm still standing,

1337
01:39:09.524 --> 01:39:12.862
I'm gonna know
for the first time in my life, see,

1338
01:39:14.738 --> 01:39:18.242
that I weren't just another bum
from the neighborhood.

1339
01:40:25.725 --> 01:40:27.520
Time, kid. Let's go.

1340
01:40:30.564 --> 01:40:32.483
I'll wait for you here.

1341
01:40:34.819 --> 01:40:37.613
How about I wait here and you fight, huh?

1342
01:40:38.488 --> 01:40:41.576
You're looking very great today,
you know that?

1343
01:40:43.578 --> 01:40:46.662
I gotta go now,
but don't you leave town, huh?

1344
01:40:48.082 --> 01:40:50.460
Wish me luck. I'm gonna need it.

1345
01:40:51.210 --> 01:40:52.545
Good luck.

1346
01:40:53.337 --> 01:40:56.631
Adrian, you don't think
this robe is too baggy, huh?

1347
01:40:56.841 --> 01:40:58.176
Good luck.

1348
01:40:58.259 --> 01:40:59.886
Don't leave town.

1349
01:41:02.261 --> 01:41:05.890
<i>I'd like you to meet my colleague,</i>
<i>Stu Nahan.</i>

1350
01:41:05.975 --> 01:41:07.350
<i>Thank you, Bill Baldwin.</i>

1351
01:41:07.435 --> 01:41:10.188
<i>The electricity is all over the place tonight,</i>
<i>as Rocky Balboa...</i>

1352
01:41:12.104 --> 01:41:13.939
What is that?

1353
01:41:14.024 --> 01:41:16.359
I trained you to be a fighter,
not a billboard.

1354
01:41:16.444 --> 01:41:19.029
- I'm doing it for a friend.
- What do you get out of it?

1355
01:41:19.113 --> 01:41:21.032
Paulie gets $3,000. I get the robe.

1356
01:41:21.113 --> 01:41:22.323
Shrewd.

1357
01:41:22.908 --> 01:41:25.578
<i>The story about tonight's fight,</i>
<i>their difference in style,</i>

1358
01:41:25.662 --> 01:41:27.912
<i>you can quote</i>
<i>a recent sports magazine which said,</i>

1359
01:41:27.997 --> 01:41:30.041
<i>it could be</i>
<i>"the caveman against the cavalier."</i>

1360
01:41:30.122 --> 01:41:32.042
<i>I notice a buzzing in the background.</i>

1361
01:41:32.126 --> 01:41:34.712
<i>Could be the challenger</i>
<i>is getting ready to get into the ring.</i>

1362
01:41:34.796 --> 01:41:36.965
Rocky, look at my date.

1363
01:41:37.046 --> 01:41:39.050
- Cost me $200.
- $250.

1364
01:41:39.131 --> 01:41:40.801
I gotta go. I gotta work.

1365
01:41:40.885 --> 01:41:43.220
- How's the robe?
- A little baggy.

1366
01:41:43.304 --> 01:41:46.224
<i>A 50-to-1 underdog</i>
<i>living a Cinderella story,</i>

1367
01:41:46.305 --> 01:41:50.019
<i>and he's captured people's imaginations</i>
<i>all over the world.</i>

1368
01:41:54.564 --> 01:41:56.317
We love you, Rocky!

1369
01:41:56.649 --> 01:41:59.487
- Good luck, champ.
- Thanks for showing up.

1370
01:41:59.988 --> 01:42:01.904
<i>And his record, 44 victories.</i>

1371
01:42:01.988 --> 01:42:04.573
<i>He's had 38 by knockout,</i>
<i>and he's lost 20 fights.</i>

1372
01:42:04.658 --> 01:42:07.036
<i>Which makes me wonder, can he stand it?</i>

1373
01:42:07.118 --> 01:42:09.747
<i>You know, the stamina and the skill</i>
<i>to last three rounds.</i>

1374
01:42:09.831 --> 01:42:11.791
<i>Because Las Vegas odds say no.</i>

1375
01:42:11.872 --> 01:42:14.711
<i>Rocky Balboa, climbing into the ring now.</i>

1376
01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:16.921
<i>"The Italian Stallion."</i>

1377
01:42:17.005 --> 01:42:20.925
<i>Some meat sign on the back of his robe.</i>
<i>You seen what that was?</i>

1378
01:42:21.009 --> 01:42:23.011
<i>Shamrock Meat...</i>

1379
01:42:23.094 --> 01:42:26.264
<i>There's a lot of noise</i>
<i>coming from the background.</i>

1380
01:42:26.764 --> 01:42:29.434
<i>- They have spotlights.</i>
<i>- Am I seeing right back there?</i>

1381
01:42:29.515 --> 01:42:32.979
<i>Is that the world heavyweight champion,</i>
<i>Apollo Creed?</i>

1382
01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:37.108
<i>He's riding in a boat.</i>
<i>Is he supposed to be George Washington?</i>

1383
01:42:37.189 --> 01:42:40.444
<i>Obviously so.</i>
<i>He's got the hat on, the whole thing.</i>

1384
01:42:41.944 --> 01:42:44.532
<i>The world champion, Apollo Creed</i>

1385
01:42:44.613 --> 01:42:47.452
<i>is doing an imitation</i>
<i>of George Washington.</i>

1386
01:42:48.411 --> 01:42:50.121
<i>He's throwing money.</i>

1387
01:42:50.203 --> 01:42:53.625
<i>Remember when we were growing up,</i>
<i>we were taught about George Washington</i>

1388
01:42:53.707 --> 01:42:55.126
<i>throwing a dollar.</i>

1389
01:42:55.207 --> 01:42:57.962
<i>If you threw a dollar in those days,</i>
<i>it went a lot farther.</i>

1390
01:42:58.046 --> 01:43:00.756
<i>Now he's taking his...</i>
<i>Blonde wig came off.</i>

1391
01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:02.466
<i>The hat came off.</i>

1392
01:43:03.801 --> 01:43:05.219
I want you!

1393
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:08.970
<i>The crowd is loving every minute of it.</i>

1394
01:43:09.055 --> 01:43:12.100
<i>- Here is the world heavyweight champion.</i>
<i>- Apollo Creed.</i>

1395
01:43:12.185 --> 01:43:13.603
<i>For you around the world</i>

1396
01:43:13.685 --> 01:43:16.604
<i>he was dressed as George Washington,</i>
<i>the father of our country.</i>

1397
01:43:16.689 --> 01:43:18.064
I want you!

1398
01:43:20.818 --> 01:43:24.322
<i>I don't believe what I'm seeing.</i>
<i>Uncle Sam himself!</i>

1399
01:43:24.404 --> 01:43:25.948
I want you!

1400
01:43:26.032 --> 01:43:28.868
I want all of you!

1401
01:43:29.452 --> 01:43:31.328
He looks like a big flag.

1402
01:43:31.412 --> 01:43:33.456
I want you!

1403
01:43:34.622 --> 01:43:36.917
- Is he talking to me?
- He's talking to you.

1404
01:43:37.001 --> 01:43:39.170
- Is he talking to me?
- Let him talk.

1405
01:43:39.252 --> 01:43:41.046
I want the Stallion!

1406
01:43:41.712 --> 01:43:44.006
<i>He says, "I want the Stallion."</i>

1407
01:43:45.510 --> 01:43:48.511
<i>For you in foreign countries,</i>
<i>during World War I,</i>

1408
01:43:48.595 --> 01:43:51.515
<i>the picture of Uncle Sam</i>
<i>with his finger pointed like that</i>

1409
01:43:51.599 --> 01:43:54.018
<i>was a recruiting poster</i>
<i>for our fellows in the service,</i>

1410
01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:56.310
<i>the army and the navy. "I want you."</i>

1411
01:43:56.395 --> 01:43:58.479
<i>That's what he's doing a take on.</i>

1412
01:43:58.564 --> 01:44:01.818
<i>He's yelling, "Creed in three."</i>

1413
01:44:01.899 --> 01:44:04.028
What do you think that outfit cost?

1414
01:44:14.412 --> 01:44:16.582
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1415
01:44:17.292 --> 01:44:21.170
<i>Good evening. A very Happy New Year.</i>

1416
01:44:21.252 --> 01:44:23.256
<i>Welcome to Philadelphia.</i>

1417
01:44:23.337 --> 01:44:26.091
<i>Everybody who's anybody is here tonight.</i>

1418
01:44:28.301 --> 01:44:31.720
<i>Time does not permit me to introduce</i>

1419
01:44:32.055 --> 01:44:35.225
<i>the many luminaries of politics,</i>

1420
01:44:35.310 --> 01:44:39.729
<i>show business and the sporting world</i>
<i>who are with us tonight</i>

1421
01:44:40.064 --> 01:44:42.233
<i>but I would like to present</i>

1422
01:44:42.317 --> 01:44:45.359
<i>one of the immortals of pugilism,</i>

1423
01:44:45.444 --> 01:44:49.073
<i>a champion in and out of the ring,</i>

1424
01:44:49.157 --> 01:44:51.908
<i>Philadelphia's own "Smokin' Joe,"</i>

1425
01:44:51.993 --> 01:44:54.828
<i>the beloved Mr. Joe Frazier!</i>

1426
01:45:05.590 --> 01:45:06.881
How you doing?

1427
01:45:06.966 --> 01:45:08.384
Don't hurt him, okay?

1428
01:45:08.466 --> 01:45:10.094
I'll try not to.

1429
01:45:10.176 --> 01:45:12.555
<i>What a credit he's been</i>
<i>in his career as a fighter.</i>

1430
01:45:12.639 --> 01:45:14.765
<i>Now he's coming over</i>
<i>to talk to the champ.</i>

1431
01:45:14.849 --> 01:45:17.268
- Hey, Joe.
- You been ducking me a long time.

1432
01:45:17.350 --> 01:45:19.020
No, Joe. You're next.

1433
01:45:19.103 --> 01:45:21.314
- You're next.
- You understand?

1434
01:45:21.854 --> 01:45:23.439
They must be friends.

1435
01:45:31.823 --> 01:45:33.658
Joe Frazier!

1436
01:45:33.743 --> 01:45:35.953
<i>- Fight fans, get settled down.</i>
- Go home!

1437
01:45:36.037 --> 01:45:39.162
- Don't stay in the arena!
<i>- It won't be long now.</i>

1438
01:45:40.625 --> 01:45:44.087
<i>Now for the main event.</i>

1439
01:45:47.796 --> 01:45:49.425
<i>On my left</i>

1440
01:45:49.509 --> 01:45:52.636
<i>the challenger, in white trunks,</i>

1441
01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:55.845
<i>weighing 190 pounds.</i>

1442
01:45:55.930 --> 01:45:58.434
<i>Philadelphia's favorite son,</i>

1443
01:45:58.518 --> 01:46:01.354
<i>The Italian Stallion,</i>

1444
01:46:01.435 --> 01:46:03.523
<i>Rocky Balboa.</i>

1445
01:46:10.488 --> 01:46:12.782
<i>And on my right</i>

1446
01:46:12.863 --> 01:46:15.326
<i>wearing red, white and blue,</i>

1447
01:46:15.408 --> 01:46:18.496
<i>weighing 210 pounds,</i>

1448
01:46:18.578 --> 01:46:22.000
<i>undefeated in 46 fights,</i>

1449
01:46:22.332 --> 01:46:24.836
<i>The Master of Disaster,</i>

1450
01:46:25.295 --> 01:46:29.006
<i>the undisputed heavyweight champion</i>
<i>of the world,</i>

1451
01:46:29.090 --> 01:46:30.881
<i>Apollo Creed!</i>

1452
01:46:32.676 --> 01:46:35.220
I want you! You!

1453
01:46:37.930 --> 01:46:40.768
You, chump. I want you!

1454
01:46:40.850 --> 01:46:43.854
You've both fought in Philadelphia before.
You know the rules.

1455
01:46:43.938 --> 01:46:47.064
No low blows,
watch your heads, no butting.

1456
01:46:47.149 --> 01:46:48.899
Shake hands and come out fighting.

1457
01:46:48.984 --> 01:46:50.653
Put your hands up there, chump.

1458
01:46:50.737 --> 01:46:52.863
- Come out fighting.
- Come on!

1459
01:46:54.863 --> 01:46:59.746
<i>Rocky's just going over and being calm,</i>
<i>it looks like from here.</i>

1460
01:47:00.872 --> 01:47:02.787
<i>There goes the big hat.</i>

1461
01:47:06.252 --> 01:47:09.837
<i>I've never seen a fighter</i>
<i>that concerned about his hair.</i>

1462
01:47:17.889 --> 01:47:20.224
<i>There's the bell for round one.</i>

1463
01:47:21.684 --> 01:47:25.813
<i>The fighters come in the center of the ring,</i>
<i>looking at each other.</i>

1464
01:47:25.895 --> 01:47:29.359
<i>Creed, the champion,</i>
<i>zipping in those left-handed jabs.</i>

1465
01:47:29.442 --> 01:47:31.359
<i>Right there. Bang.</i>

1466
01:47:32.987 --> 01:47:36.198
<i>The champ stinging the slower challenger</i>
<i>with jabs at will.</i>

1467
01:47:36.282 --> 01:47:40.243
<i>In fact, it looks like Rocky</i>
<i>is blocking the blows with his face.</i>

1468
01:47:40.328 --> 01:47:44.747
<i>The champion doesn't look the best</i>
<i>he's ever been, but he's moving now.</i>

1469
01:47:44.832 --> 01:47:48.752
<i>The champion's smiling now.</i>
<i>He's toying with him.</i>

1470
01:47:49.587 --> 01:47:52.506
<i>Trying to give the fans</i>
<i>their money's worth.</i>

1471
01:47:54.175 --> 01:47:57.636
<i>He's very clearly outclassed</i>
<i>the challenger right now.</i>

1472
01:47:59.805 --> 01:48:03.768
<i>He's trying to make his man miss like that.</i>

1473
01:48:05.269 --> 01:48:07.895
<i>The champ is just taunting him.</i>

1474
01:48:10.774 --> 01:48:12.609
<i>Creed dancing around.</i>

1475
01:48:14.028 --> 01:48:15.863
<i>I don't believe this!</i>

1476
01:48:15.947 --> 01:48:18.323
<i>The champ is down!</i>

1477
01:48:24.453 --> 01:48:25.662
<i>Creed is down!</i>

1478
01:48:25.747 --> 01:48:27.707
<i>What a surprise this is!</i>

1479
01:48:28.876 --> 01:48:32.212
<i>This is the first time the champion</i>
<i>has ever been knocked down.</i>

1480
01:48:32.296 --> 01:48:34.506
<i>The referee is giving him the count.</i>

1481
01:48:34.590 --> 01:48:37.426
Six, seven, eight.

1482
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:40.386
<i>He appears to be all right.</i>
<i>Glassy-eyed but okay.</i>

1483
01:48:40.761 --> 01:48:43.972
Go to the ribs! Go to work, Rock!

1484
01:48:44.055 --> 01:48:45.560
Come on!

1485
01:48:46.853 --> 01:48:50.064
<i>Rocky coming back out,</i>
<i>and he's like a bull in a china closet.</i>

1486
01:48:50.148 --> 01:48:53.067
<i>He really wants it. Apollo, left to the head.</i>

1487
01:48:53.192 --> 01:48:56.863
<i>The champion's coming off the floor</i>

1488
01:48:56.944 --> 01:48:59.032
<i>and he's trying to put him away.</i>

1489
01:48:59.113 --> 01:49:00.658
<i>A left, a right.</i>

1490
01:49:00.742 --> 01:49:04.203
<i>Combinations into the face!</i>
<i>That's the Apollo we know.</i>

1491
01:49:08.291 --> 01:49:11.667
<i>Now the champ is taunting Rocky</i>
<i>to come and get some more.</i>

1492
01:49:11.752 --> 01:49:13.377
<i>A left. Another.</i>

1493
01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:15.381
<i>Another left.</i>

1494
01:49:16.841 --> 01:49:18.635
<i>Rocky's coming back!</i>

1495
01:49:20.094 --> 01:49:23.014
<i>Rocky's got him on the ropes!</i>

1496
01:49:23.805 --> 01:49:25.305
Let's break it.

1497
01:49:26.809 --> 01:49:28.353
You're holding.

1498
01:49:28.435 --> 01:49:30.229
You're posing as a boxer.

1499
01:49:30.313 --> 01:49:33.399
<i>There's no way we expected</i>
<i>this kind of hitting.</i>

1500
01:49:36.484 --> 01:49:38.569
Do your best. Do your best.

1501
01:49:40.948 --> 01:49:44.702
<i>Apollo unloading a left.</i>
<i>He's got him up against the ropes.</i>

1502
01:49:52.417 --> 01:49:56.546
<i>They're leading him to his corner.</i>
<i>Rocky can't find his way.</i>

1503
01:49:57.256 --> 01:49:58.631
I called it!

1504
01:49:58.716 --> 01:50:01.260
- Your nose is broke.
- How's it look?

1505
01:50:01.344 --> 01:50:02.845
It's an improvement.

1506
01:50:02.929 --> 01:50:06.180
Quit shucking and jiving! Stick and move!

1507
01:50:06.265 --> 01:50:09.769
Go for the ribs.
Don't let that bastard breathe.

1508
01:50:09.850 --> 01:50:11.270
The guy's quick.

1509
01:50:11.354 --> 01:50:15.149
He doesn't know it's a damn show.
He thinks it's a damn fight.

1510
01:50:15.233 --> 01:50:17.944
Finish this bum, and let's go home.

1511
01:50:18.944 --> 01:50:21.322
Stay to the body. You're doing great!

1512
01:50:21.404 --> 01:50:24.617
<i>Round two.</i>
<i>Creed predicted he'd win in it in three.</i>

1513
01:50:24.701 --> 01:50:28.287
<i>Creed got knocked down in the first.</i>
<i>He came back strong.</i>

1514
01:50:28.621 --> 01:50:30.287
<i>He's working now.</i>

1515
01:50:30.707 --> 01:50:33.457
<i>A sharp left. Again, a hard right.</i>

1516
01:50:33.542 --> 01:50:36.045
<i>Now coming in.</i>
<i>He's knocked him into the corner again.</i>

1517
01:50:36.127 --> 01:50:38.631
<i>The champion's got him</i>
<i>backed into the corner.</i>

1518
01:50:38.715 --> 01:50:42.635
<i>Pummeling him left and right,</i>
<i>his head bouncing against the ropes.</i>

1519
01:50:43.511 --> 01:50:46.595
<i>Balboa's taking</i>
<i>a tremendous beating here.</i>

1520
01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:50.268
<i>Battering him like a punching bag.</i>
<i>What's keeping him up?</i>

1521
01:50:52.603 --> 01:50:54.063
Can't you fight?

1522
01:50:54.145 --> 01:50:57.399
Stop clowning around
and give the people something!

1523
01:50:58.067 --> 01:51:00.403
- Come on!
<i>- He says he wants more!</i>

1524
01:51:00.484 --> 01:51:03.279
<i>He wants more. You folks</i>
<i>watching television around the world</i>

1525
01:51:03.363 --> 01:51:05.408
<i>you're watching a battle.</i>

1526
01:51:10.162 --> 01:51:13.497
<i>Balboa trying to fight back.</i>
<i>Oh, he tagged the champ!</i>

1527
01:51:13.582 --> 01:51:17.086
<i>The champion is trying to get out of there,</i>
<i>but he can't do it.</i>

1528
01:51:17.170 --> 01:51:21.046
<i>He is being barraged with lefts and rights</i>
<i>to the head and body.</i>

1529
01:51:21.131 --> 01:51:24.426
<i>Balboa is tagging the champion</i>
<i>right on the kisser!</i>

1530
01:51:25.426 --> 01:51:28.680
<i>The referee steps in.</i>
<i>They're ready to keep going.</i>

1531
01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:31.059
Back to your corners!

1532
01:51:31.684 --> 01:51:33.603
Come on, Creed!

1533
01:51:34.354 --> 01:51:36.604
<i>This is gonna be a tough one.</i>

1534
01:52:31.243 --> 01:52:33.578
<i>- Back with a left!</i>
<i>- He got tagged!</i>

1535
01:52:35.206 --> 01:52:37.750
<i>The referee's wiping off the gloves.</i>

1536
01:52:42.962 --> 01:52:45.300
<i>Hard left and right combination!</i>

1537
01:52:45.381 --> 01:52:48.301
<i>- What is keeping him up, Bill?</i>
<i>- I don't know.</i>

1538
01:52:50.261 --> 01:52:53.555
<i>He can't even get his gloves up</i>
<i>to protect himself.</i>

1539
01:53:00.979 --> 01:53:03.067
Down! Stay down!

1540
01:53:03.149 --> 01:53:05.444
<i>Apollo has his arms in the air!</i>

1541
01:53:16.497 --> 01:53:17.622
Five.

1542
01:53:18.916 --> 01:53:20.001
Six.

1543
01:53:20.585 --> 01:53:21.792
Seven.

1544
01:53:21.877 --> 01:53:23.046
Eight.

1545
01:53:23.462 --> 01:53:24.546
Nine.

1546
01:53:31.429 --> 01:53:32.680
Come on!

1547
01:53:33.970 --> 01:53:35.975
<i>Apollo can't believe it.</i>

1548
01:53:52.742 --> 01:53:55.953
<i>The champion got a left to his right ribs.</i>

1549
01:53:56.328 --> 01:53:58.537
<i>This has been a tremendous...</i>

1550
01:54:04.337 --> 01:54:05.505
Okay, champ?

1551
01:54:05.587 --> 01:54:06.881
Yeah, I'm okay.

1552
01:54:06.965 --> 01:54:09.591
I may have broke my ribs.

1553
01:54:09.676 --> 01:54:12.136
I can't see nothing. Gotta open my eye.

1554
01:54:12.220 --> 01:54:14.136
- Cut me.
- Don't wanna do it.

1555
01:54:14.220 --> 01:54:16.724
- Go ahead. Cut me.
- Okay.

1556
01:54:16.805 --> 01:54:18.350
Try it. Cut it.

1557
01:54:18.810 --> 01:54:20.685
Creed! Creed!

1558
01:54:22.645 --> 01:54:23.854
Oh, God.

1559
01:54:23.939 --> 01:54:26.734
You're bleeding inside.
I'm gonna stop the fight.

1560
01:54:26.818 --> 01:54:30.113
You ain't stopping nothing, man.

1561
01:54:30.319 --> 01:54:32.782
You stop this fight, I'll kill you!

1562
01:54:34.158 --> 01:54:36.327
- I'm going.
- If you wanna go.

1563
01:54:37.537 --> 01:54:39.872
You gotta give it all!

1564
01:54:39.997 --> 01:54:41.916
You gotta get him!

1565
01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:49.340
<i>The 15th and final round.</i>

1566
01:54:49.421 --> 01:54:52.426
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

1567
01:54:58.265 --> 01:55:00.893
<i>They look like they've been in a war.</i>

1568
01:55:08.524 --> 01:55:11.904
<i>A hard right.</i>
<i>The champion really tagged him.</i>

1569
01:55:11.988 --> 01:55:15.948
<i>Apollo clearly protecting</i>
<i>his right side, his ribs.</i>

1570
01:55:19.368 --> 01:55:21.162
<i>Body punches!</i>

1571
01:55:21.247 --> 01:55:24.667
<i>Hard lefts and rights. Look at the blood</i>
<i>coming out of his mouth!</i>

1572
01:55:24.751 --> 01:55:26.877
<i>He's spitting up blood now.</i>

1573
01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:32.841
<i>A tremendous right hand by Rocky.</i>

1574
01:55:32.925 --> 01:55:34.301
Go for it, Rock!

1575
01:55:34.385 --> 01:55:37.430
<i>- Listen to this crowd!</i>
<i>- Right to the ribs.</i>

1576
01:55:37.511 --> 01:55:39.805
<i>Another to the ribs. That left hand again.</i>

1577
01:55:39.890 --> 01:55:43.144
<i>Right to the jaw!</i>
<i>He's got him up against the ropes!</i>

1578
01:55:43.225 --> 01:55:45.313
<i>Apollo the champ...</i>

1579
01:55:48.774 --> 01:55:51.527
Ain't gonna be no rematch.

1580
01:55:52.153 --> 01:55:53.694
Don't want one.

1581
01:56:04.207 --> 01:56:07.167
Rocky, you went the distance, 15 rounds.
How do you feel?

1582
01:56:07.251 --> 01:56:09.752
- All right.
- What were you thinking about...

1583
01:56:09.837 --> 01:56:12.465
- Adrian!
...coming out for the 15th round?

1584
01:56:12.546 --> 01:56:13.800
Adrian!

1585
01:56:15.801 --> 01:56:16.970
Rocky!

1586
01:56:21.305 --> 01:56:23.140
<i>- Tonight...</i>
- Rocky!

1587
01:56:23.225 --> 01:56:26.270
<i>... we have had the privilege of witnessing</i>

1588
01:56:26.354 --> 01:56:29.983
<i>the greatest exhibition of boxing stamina</i>

1589
01:56:30.064 --> 01:56:32.149
<i>in the history of the ring.</i>

1590
01:56:32.234 --> 01:56:33.819
Adrian!

1591
01:56:34.612 --> 01:56:35.822
Rocky!

1592
01:56:36.654 --> 01:56:38.781
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1593
01:56:38.864 --> 01:56:41.661
<i>we have a split decision.</i>

1594
01:56:42.868 --> 01:56:44.328
<i>Judge Walker</i>

1595
01:56:47.792 --> 01:56:49.167
<i>for Creed!</i>

1596
01:56:51.837 --> 01:56:53.006
Adrian!

1597
01:56:53.131 --> 01:56:56.634
- Your fans want a rematch.
- Ain't gonna be no rematch!

1598
01:56:58.426 --> 01:57:00.179
- Adrian!
- You heard him...

1599
01:57:00.261 --> 01:57:03.390
- You can't go in there!
- That's my friend. Let go!

1600
01:57:03.474 --> 01:57:05.975
- You're wrecking the jacket!
- Rocky!

1601
01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:08.688
- Paulie.
- Adrian!

1602
01:57:10.398 --> 01:57:12.734
- Adrian! Where's your hat?
- Rocky!

1603
01:57:12.817 --> 01:57:14.068
I love you!

1604
01:57:14.152 --> 01:57:15.528
I love you!

1605
01:57:19.198 --> 01:57:21.701
- I love you!
- I love you!

1606
01:57:21.783 --> 01:57:23.368
I love you!
