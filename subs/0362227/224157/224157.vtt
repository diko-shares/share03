See this bunch

00:01:45.106 --> 00:01:47.859
That's the tour from China,
connecting to Orlando.

19
00:01:47.942 --> 00:01:50.528
When was the last time
you saw Chinese tourists

20
00:01:50.612 --> 00:01:54.239
on their way to Disney World
without any cameras?

21
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.118
Possible forged documents

22
00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:07.879
Sir. Sir. Passport.

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:11.341
Thank you.

24
00:02:12.342 --> 00:02:15.678
Welcome, Mr. Navorski.

25
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.639
Purpose of your visit?

26
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.559
Business or pleasure?

27
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.200
Sir, I have an IBIS hit on six.

28
00:02:37.283 --> 00:02:38.660
No!

29
00:02:38.743 --> 00:02:42.038
Mr. Navorski, please follow me.

30
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.750
Flight number 746 from Montreal

31
00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:49.379
must proceed to US Immigration
before claiming their luggage.

32
00:02:49.462 --> 00:02:53.591
All right, Mr. Navorski,
we'd like you to wait here, please.

33
00:02:53.675 --> 00:02:56.553
Next, please.

34
00:03:11.192 --> 00:03:14.487

Staying at the Ramada Inn?

39
00:03:35.091 --> 00:03:37.468
Keep the change.

40
00:03:37.552 --> 00:03:40.805
Do you know anyone in New York?

41
00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.348
Yes.

42
00:03:42.432 --> 00:03:45.101
- Who?
- Yes.

43
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.856
- Who?
- Yes.

44
00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.109
- No, do you know anyone in New York?
- Yes.

45
00:03:53.151 --> 00:03:55.069
- Who?
- Yes.

46
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.452
161 Lexington.

47
00:04:02.535 --> 00:04:06.080
OK, Mr. Navorski, I need to see
your return ticket, please.

48
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.834
No, your return ticket. Your..

49
00:04:09.918 --> 00:04:12.045
- Oh.. Yes.
- Ah.

50
00:04:15.298 --> 00:04:17.217
This is just a standard procedure.

51
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.387
I'm going to need the passport also.

52
00:04:21.471 --> 00:04:23.348
Oh.. OK.

53
00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:24.933
- No, no.
- Thank you.

54
00:04:25.016 --> 00:04:26.559
Mr. Navorski.

55
00:04:28.019 --> 00:04:30.522
That. Passport.

56
00:04:33.316 --> 00:04:35.193
That

57
00:04:40.782 --> 00:04:42.951
Mr. Navorski?
Sorry to keep you waiting.

58
00:04:43.034 --> 00:04:48.206
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs
and Border Protection here at JFK.

59
00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.000
I help people
with their immigration problems.

60
00:04:51.084 --> 00:04:53.753
We're looking for
an interpreter for you.

61
00:04:53.837 --> 00:04:57.590
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?

62
00:04:57.674 --> 00:05:00.593
But I understand
that you speak a little English.

63
00:05:00.677 --> 00:05:03.304
- Yes.
- You do?

64
00:05:03.388 --> 00:05:06.641
I hope you don't mind if I eat
while we talk. I've a bit of bad news.

65
00:05:06.724 --> 00:05:09.644
Your country has suspended
all traveling privileges

66
00:05:09.727 --> 00:05:12.313
on passports issued
by your government.

67
00:05:12.397 --> 00:05:15.316
And our State Department
has revoked the visa

68
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.735
that was going to allow you
to enter the US.

69
00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:20.488
That's it in a nutshell, basically.

70
00:05:20.572 --> 00:05:24.868
While you were in the air there
was a military coup in your country.

71
00:05:24.951 --> 00:05:27.912
Most of the dead were members
of the Presidential Guard.

72
00:05:27.996 --> 00:05:30.456
They were attacked
in the middle of the night.

73
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.750
They got it all on GHN, I think.

74
00:05:32.834 --> 00:05:36.212
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.

75
00:05:36.296 --> 00:05:40.008
Mr. Navorski, your country
was annexed from the inside.

76
00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:42.719
The Republic of Krakozhia
is under new leadership.

77
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.638
Krakozhia. Krakozhia

78
00:05:47.182 --> 00:05:52.687
- Krakozhia.
- Right. I don't think he gets it.

79
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.899
Er.. Let me.. OK. Look.

80
00:05:55.982 --> 00:05:58.359
Imagine that these potato chips
are Krakozhia.

81
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:00.737
Kra-kozhia.

82
00:06:00.778 --> 00:06:02.280
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.

83
00:06:02.322 --> 00:06:04.240
- Krakozhia.
- OK.

84
00:06:04.324 --> 00:06:08.119
Er.. So the potato chips are Krakozhia.

85
00:06:08.203 --> 00:06:11.789
- And this apple..
- Big Apple. Big Apple.

86
00:06:11.873 --> 00:06:14.542
Big Apple represents
the Liberty Rebels.

87
00:06:15.293 --> 00:06:17.212
OK?

88
00:06:18.463 --> 00:06:21.174
No more Krakozhia! OK?

89
00:06:21.257 --> 00:06:25.803
New government.
Revolution. You understand?

90
00:06:25.887 --> 00:06:29.098
All the flights in and out
of your country have been suspended.

91
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.102
The new government has sealed all
borders, so your visa's no longer valid.

92
00:06:33.186 --> 00:06:36.689
So, currently
you are a citizen of nowhere.

93
00:06:36.773 --> 00:06:38.650
Now, we can't process you new papers

94
00:06:38.733 --> 00:06:44.489
until the US recognizes your country's
new diplomatic reclassification.

95
00:06:44.572 --> 00:06:47.158
You don't qualify for asylum,
refugee status,

96
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.994
temporary protective status,
humanitarian parole,

97
00:06:50.078 --> 00:06:53.998
or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.

98
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.959
You are at this time simply..

99
00:06:58.253 --> 00:07:01.756
unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.

100
00:07:01.798 --> 00:07:04.050
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.

101
00:07:04.133 --> 00:07:10.682
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge,
Empire State, Broadway show Cats.

102
00:07:10.765 --> 00:07:13.893
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.

103
00:07:13.977 --> 00:07:15.770
OK. OK.

104
00:07:15.854 --> 00:07:18.815
Now I go New York City. Thank you.

105
00:07:18.898 --> 00:07:22.861
No, Mr. Navorski. I cannot allow you
to enter the United States at this time.

106
00:07:22.944 --> 00:07:26.322
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.

107
00:07:26.406 --> 00:07:30.076
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.

108
00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:35.373
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?

109
00:07:35.456 --> 00:07:38.668
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.

110
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.004
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.

111
00:07:41.087 --> 00:07:43.006
Really? It's not important.

112
00:07:43.089 --> 00:07:46.384
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?

113
00:07:46.426 --> 00:07:48.928
OK, Mr. Navorski, come here.

114
00:07:49.012 --> 00:07:51.181
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.

115
00:07:51.264 --> 00:07:54.934
You have no right to enter the US
and I have no right to detain you.

116
00:07:55.018 --> 00:07:57.478
You have fallen through
a crack in the system.

117
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.274
- I am crack.
- Yes. Until we get this sorted out,

118
00:08:01.357 --> 00:08:05.403
I will allow you to enter
the International Transit Lounge.

119
00:08:05.486 --> 00:08:08.948
I'm going to sign a release form
that is going to make you a free man.

120
00:08:09.032 --> 00:08:11.201
- Free?
- Free. Free.

121
00:08:11.242 --> 00:08:17.040
Free to go anywhere you like
in the International Transit Lounge.

122
00:08:17.081 --> 00:08:19.000
- OK?
- OK.

123
00:08:19.083 --> 00:08:21.419
- OK.
- OK.

124
00:08:21.461 --> 00:08:22.587
OK.

125
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.215
Uncle Sam will have this
sorted out by tomorrow,

126
00:08:25.298 --> 00:08:27.717
and welcome
to the United States. Almost.

127
00:08:29.177 --> 00:08:31.137
- Thank you.
- OK. All right.

128
00:08:31.221 --> 00:08:33.139
Thanks, Judge.

129
00:08:49.531 --> 00:08:53.535
Announcing the arrival
of flight 76 from Singapore Airlines.

130
00:08:53.576 --> 00:08:55.495
Now, Mr. Navorski.

131
00:08:55.578 --> 00:08:57.288
Mr. Navorski. Mr. Navorski.

132
00:08:57.372 --> 00:08:59.874
This is the International
Transit Lounge.

133
00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.919
You are free to wait here.
These are food vouchers.

134
00:09:02.961 --> 00:09:07.048
You can use them in the Food Court.
Your Krakozhian money is no good here.

135
00:09:07.131 --> 00:09:09.926
This is a 15-minute,
prepaid calling card.

136
00:09:10.009 --> 00:09:12.303
You may call home, if you like.

137
00:09:12.345 --> 00:09:16.307
This, in case we need to contact you,
is a pager.

138
00:09:16.349 --> 00:09:19.561
You must keep this
with you at all times.

139
00:09:19.644 --> 00:09:25.024
Here is an ID badge for you
to get into CBP. Beyond those doors..

140
00:09:25.108 --> 00:09:28.695
Mr. Navorski.
I'm going to need you to look at me.

141
00:09:28.778 --> 00:09:31.447
Beyond those doors is American soil.

142
00:09:31.531 --> 00:09:34.075
Mr. Dixon wants me to make it clear

143
00:09:34.117 --> 00:09:36.786
that you are not
to enter through those doors.

144
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:41.082
You are not to leave this building.
America is closed.

145
00:09:41.124 --> 00:09:43.042
America closed.

146
00:09:44.335 --> 00:09:46.087
What I do?

147
00:09:47.255 --> 00:09:50.800
There's only one thing
you can do here, Mr. Navorski.

148
00:09:50.884 --> 00:09:53.094
Shop.

149
00:09:53.178 --> 00:09:57.432
Passengers of flight 854
New York/Warsaw..

150
00:09:57.515 --> 00:09:59.434
Brass band plays]

151
00:10:04.189 --> 00:10:08.359
The international community
tries to secure a peaceful resolution.

152
00:10:08.443 --> 00:10:12.655
The populace has to wonder if
they will ever find political stability,

153
00:10:12.739 --> 00:10:17.911
or find the leadership to secure
their place on the world stage.

154
00:10:17.994 --> 00:10:20.580
And next this hour,
looking to buy a 90-foot yacht?

155
00:10:26.711 --> 00:10:30.715
Taken hostage. We're hearing
that the Vice President has been killed

156
00:10:30.757 --> 00:10:34.844
along with four cabinet members,
13 injured soldiers and 20 civilians.

157
00:10:34.928 --> 00:10:37.972
By dawn, rebel leaders
had surrounded the state houses.

158
00:10:38.056 --> 00:10:41.851
In a symbolic gesture, the national flag
of Krakozhia was torn down

159
00:10:41.935 --> 00:10:44.979
from the Presidential Palace
and the parliament building.

160
00:11:09.796 --> 00:11:11.673
Please. Please.

161
00:11:12.507 --> 00:11:13.925
Television.

162
00:11:18.555 --> 00:11:21.641
Passenger Chen Wan-Shiu
and Liu Tao-Jing,

163
00:11:21.724 --> 00:11:24.936
please come to podium
to pick up your boarding passes.

164
00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:43.496
This is just in. Last night a military coup
overthrew the government of Krakozhia.

165
00:11:43.538 --> 00:11:46.249
Bombing and gunfire
were heard through the night.

166
00:11:46.332 --> 00:11:48.418
Although details are unclear,

167
00:11:48.459 --> 00:11:53.715
we are told that President Vagobagin
and his aides have been taken hostage.

168
00:11:53.798 --> 00:11:56.634
Bonjour, monsieur.
You are a Red Carpet Club member?

169
00:11:59.053 --> 00:12:03.016
I need to see
your boarding pass and club card, sir.

170
00:12:03.057 --> 00:12:06.102
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a private lounge.

171
00:12:06.186 --> 00:12:09.439
The public lounge is downstairs.

172
00:12:10.899 --> 00:12:16.446
The tiniest nation in the region
has been shaken by another uprising.

173
00:12:16.487 --> 00:12:21.159
Krakozhia has been involved in civil war
throughout the late '80s and '90s

174
00:12:21.242 --> 00:12:24.120
as it has tried
to transition from Communist rule.

175
00:12:49.103 --> 00:12:51.022
- Watch it!
- Please.

176
00:12:52.398 --> 00:12:54.317
Please, telephone?
Telephone?

177
00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.278
Telephone?

178
00:13:00.031 --> 00:13:03.576
Please. Please.

179
00:13:33.189 --> 00:13:37.068
For security reasons, please
keep your luggage with you at all times.

180
00:13:37.151 --> 00:13:41.990
Unattended luggage will be removed
for inspection and may be destroyed.

181
00:13:55.962 --> 00:14:00.550
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, you broke my bag!

182
00:14:00.633 --> 00:14:04.179
I got this in Paris.
This is my favorite bag.

183
00:14:04.262 --> 00:14:09.267
I can't believe you just broke my bag!
Mom, Dad! He broke my bag!

184
00:14:18.234 --> 00:14:22.822
- Food document.
- Excuse me. Stop it. Stop it.

185
00:14:22.864 --> 00:14:25.283
Do you have an appointment?

186
00:14:25.366 --> 00:14:31.039
I don't let anyone to look
at my trash without an appointment.

187
00:14:31.122 --> 00:14:34.000
I have an opening next Tuesday.

188
00:14:34.083 --> 00:14:37.879
Tuesday. Tuesday,
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Tuesday.

189
00:14:37.921 --> 00:14:41.591
It will be good time for you
to come back and get lost.

190
00:14:41.633 --> 00:14:43.885
OK, goodbye. Sorry.

191
00:14:45.678 --> 00:14:47.597
Tuesday.

192
00:17:39.519 --> 00:17:41.479
Don't shoot!

193
00:17:49.028 --> 00:17:54.367
She sleeps 12, Frank. Has a
120-volt generator, wet bar, gas range.

194
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.327
She looks amazing.

195
00:17:56.411 --> 00:17:58.955
She's my pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

196
00:17:59.038 --> 00:18:01.749
She's a beautiful boat
and I hope you get her soon.

197
00:18:01.833 --> 00:18:04.836
- You've earned her.
- Thank you, Frank.

198
00:18:04.919 --> 00:18:07.547
- You have.
- Actually, I bought her yesterday.

199
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:10.508
Come on. Congratulations!

200
00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:13.052
I'm nominating you to take my place.

201
00:18:13.761 --> 00:18:17.265
You will assume the duties
of acting Field Commissioner

202
00:18:17.348 --> 00:18:20.018
until you get approval from Washington.

203
00:18:20.101 --> 00:18:22.478
Really? I don't know what to say.

204
00:18:23.354 --> 00:18:26.858
- Jesus. Richard, is this real?
- It's real, Frank, it's real.

205
00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.277
Don't pretend to be surprised.

206
00:18:31.196 --> 00:18:34.616
You've been waiting for me to retire
or drop dead for years now.

207
00:18:34.699 --> 00:18:37.327
No, I haven't been
waiting for you to retire.

208
00:18:39.329 --> 00:18:40.872
That's all right, Frank.

209
00:18:40.955 --> 00:18:44.459
My retirement will become official
the day you get sworn in.

210
00:18:47.545 --> 00:18:51.341
- You've waited a long time for this.
- I have.

211
00:18:51.424 --> 00:18:54.928
Just be careful
about the inspection process.

212
00:18:55.011 --> 00:18:57.889
I will.
I've been here for 17 years..

213
00:18:57.972 --> 00:19:01.100
We're talking about
the Field Commissioner position.

214
00:19:01.142 --> 00:19:05.313
People are going to look to you
for leadership, to set an example.

215
00:19:07.398 --> 00:19:09.567
What are you saying?

216
00:19:11.611 --> 00:19:14.948
I'm saying the job is yours to lose.

217
00:19:15.031 --> 00:19:19.160
Ship the Colombians
off to asylum hearings,

218
00:19:19.244 --> 00:19:21.913
and call the parents
of those kids from Long Island.

219
00:19:21.996 --> 00:19:24.791
Tell them it was a bad idea
to let them go to Jamaica.

220
00:19:24.832 --> 00:19:28.044
Come on, let's go. South America
and Madrid are on the tarmac.

221
00:19:28.127 --> 00:19:30.380
I want them out of here in half an hour.

222
00:19:34.634 --> 00:19:37.178
Mr. Thurman.

223
00:19:37.262 --> 00:19:41.391
There's a man walking around
the terminal in a bathrobe.

224
00:19:41.432 --> 00:19:44.853
I know, sir. You put him there.

225
00:20:03.872 --> 00:20:05.874
Welcome to the United States.

226
00:20:05.915 --> 00:20:07.417
Next!

227
00:20:11.004 --> 00:20:12.630
I need visa.

228
00:20:12.672 --> 00:20:16.050
Where's your green form?
I can't do anything without it.

229
00:20:16.134 --> 00:20:18.011
Go to the wall.

230
00:20:18.052 --> 00:20:19.512
Next!

231
00:20:21.723 --> 00:20:23.474
Sir.

232
00:20:26.477 --> 00:20:28.897
The light green form.

233
00:20:31.691 --> 00:20:35.361
I love New York..

234
00:20:35.445 --> 00:20:37.864
- I love it!
- New York

235
00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:44.120
I love New York

236
00:20:45.371 --> 00:20:49.542
I love New York..

237
00:20:54.339 --> 00:20:56.633
Light green.

238
00:20:58.718 --> 00:21:01.971
Mr. Navorski, you cannot
get into New York without a visa.

239
00:21:02.055 --> 00:21:04.140
You cannot get a visa
without a passport,

240
00:21:04.224 --> 00:21:06.935
and you cannot get
a new passport without a country.

241
00:21:07.018 --> 00:21:09.521
There's nothing
we can do for you here.

242
00:21:09.562 --> 00:21:11.481
I give you light green.

243
00:21:11.523 --> 00:21:14.692
I'm sorry,
but you've wasted an entire day.

244
00:21:14.734 --> 00:21:16.653
At this time you are simply..

245
00:21:18.112 --> 00:21:20.740
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.

246
00:21:20.782 --> 00:21:21.741
Unacceptable.

247
00:21:23.826 --> 00:21:25.578
Why is he still here?

248
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.749
You released him, sir.
You put him there.

249
00:21:29.791 --> 00:21:33.586
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?

250
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:38.424
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.

251
00:21:41.135 --> 00:21:44.722
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?

252
00:21:44.764 --> 00:21:49.060
No news from the State Department,
but we can deport him in a few days.

253
00:21:49.143 --> 00:21:52.730
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.

254
00:21:52.772 --> 00:21:56.442
Who knows what this guy is thinking,
what gulag he escaped from.

255
00:21:56.484 --> 00:21:58.403
Next!

256
00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:02.824
Everything he does comes back to me.

257
00:22:02.866 --> 00:22:06.578
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.

258
00:22:08.746 --> 00:22:10.081
Hello.

259
00:22:11.082 --> 00:22:13.001
Hello.

260
00:22:13.877 --> 00:22:17.255
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes. 9.30.

261
00:22:17.338 --> 00:22:20.466
Food document, trash. Tuesday.

262
00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.803
Tuesday. I hate the Tuesday.

263
00:22:23.887 --> 00:22:25.388
Excuse me.

264
00:22:50.788 --> 00:22:54.667
Airports are tricky places,
Mr. Navorski.

265
00:22:54.709 --> 00:22:57.378
I'm about to tell you something.

266
00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.006
Something you can
never repeat to anyone.

267
00:23:00.089 --> 00:23:02.717
Do you understand? It's a secret.

268
00:23:02.759 --> 00:23:05.345
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.

269
00:23:05.428 --> 00:23:10.600
At 12 o'clock today, the guards
at those doors will leave their posts

270
00:23:10.683 --> 00:23:14.145
and their replacements
are going to be five minutes late.

271
00:23:14.229 --> 00:23:16.272
Late five minutes.

272
00:23:16.356 --> 00:23:21.319
Yes. Late five minutes. At 12 o'clock.
Just today. Just this once.

273
00:23:21.361 --> 00:23:23.571
No one is going
to be watching those doors.

274
00:23:23.655 --> 00:23:28.159
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.

275
00:23:28.201 --> 00:23:29.327
No.

276
00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:33.414
America, for five minutes, is open.

277
00:23:33.498 --> 00:23:35.542
Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski.

278
00:23:44.926 --> 00:23:48.263
Catch and release. it's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.

279
00:23:48.346 --> 00:23:51.307
You unhook him
and place him back in the water.

280
00:23:51.349 --> 00:23:55.979
You set him free so that somebody else
can have the pleasure of catching him.

281
00:23:59.023 --> 00:24:01.192
All right, here we go.

282
00:24:01.276 --> 00:24:03.444
OK. Call them off.

283
00:24:03.486 --> 00:24:05.738
Johnson, clear the doors.

284
00:24:08.616 --> 00:24:09.701
All right. Go.

285
00:24:09.742 --> 00:24:12.912
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.

286
00:24:13.872 --> 00:24:15.623
All right.

287
00:24:15.665 --> 00:24:18.376
Here we go.
Now where is he?

288
00:24:18.459 --> 00:24:21.254
- There he is.
- No, that's not him.

289
00:24:21.296 --> 00:24:23.214
There he is.

290
00:24:23.298 --> 00:24:24.757
All right, Viktor.

291
00:24:25.466 --> 00:24:26.968
Here we go.

292
00:24:43.359 --> 00:24:47.071
What's so complicated? Exit, Viktor.

293
00:24:47.155 --> 00:24:50.450
Come on. In a few minutes,
you'll be somebody else's problem.

294
00:24:50.533 --> 00:24:52.660
He wants to make sure
nobody's watching.

295
00:24:52.744 --> 00:24:55.121
I told him nobody would be watching.

296
00:24:55.163 --> 00:24:58.499
Come on. All right, here we go.

297
00:24:58.583 --> 00:25:00.960
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.

298
00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:03.630
Excuse me.

299
00:25:23.191 --> 00:25:25.777
You got it. There we go.

300
00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:29.030
He's got to get a running start,
I guess.

301
00:25:29.113 --> 00:25:31.491
Just leave. Just leave.

302
00:25:31.574 --> 00:25:33.576
Leave.Leave.

303
00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:37.080
What are you doing?
Why is he kneeling? Is he praying?

304
00:25:37.163 --> 00:25:39.624
No. He's tying his shoelace.

305
00:25:44.921 --> 00:25:47.131
Come on, leave.

306
00:25:47.173 --> 00:25:49.092
Get the cameras.

307
00:25:55.682 --> 00:25:59.185
Where is he? Where is he?

308
00:26:03.523 --> 00:26:06.359
- To the left of here.
- No. He was at the door.

309
00:26:06.401 --> 00:26:09.279
- Just go a little left.
- All right. All right.

310
00:26:17.912 --> 00:26:19.289
I wait.

311
00:26:26.087 --> 00:26:29.257
What are you looking at?
Go back to work. Thank you.

312
00:26:36.514 --> 00:26:39.559
Oh, God. Oh, shit.

313
00:26:47.525 --> 00:26:50.486
- This belong you?
- Thank you.

314
00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:52.405
Oh, shit.

315
00:26:53.781 --> 00:26:56.951
See? Wet floor.

316
00:26:57.035 --> 00:26:58.536
That you.

317
00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.079
I'm so late.

318
00:27:00.121 --> 00:27:02.790
Buenos Aires.
I can't remember the gate.

319
00:27:02.874 --> 00:27:04.959
Gate 24.

320
00:27:05.001 --> 00:27:07.337
- You sure?
- Yes.

321
00:27:08.838 --> 00:27:10.548
Thanks.

322
00:27:10.632 --> 00:27:13.384
Ladies and gentlemen..

323
00:27:13.426 --> 00:27:15.470
Wait.

324
00:27:15.512 --> 00:27:18.139
For you. Payless Shoes.

325
00:27:18.223 --> 00:27:20.725
Second floor.
Sensible heels.

326
00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:35.490
- Hi, baby.
- Come here, you.

327
00:27:41.412 --> 00:27:46.876
I think he's CIA.
The CIA put him here to spy on us.

328
00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.672
You don't know what you're talking
about. He doesn't speak English.

329
00:27:50.713 --> 00:27:53.091
If he could learn to speak, this guy.

330
00:27:53.132 --> 00:27:57.053
He can't speak English, how could he
have a meeting with a beautiful woman?

331
00:27:57.095 --> 00:27:58.388
A flight attendant.

332
00:27:58.471 --> 00:28:00.849
- So, she's CIA, too?
- No.

333
00:28:00.932 --> 00:28:06.437
She look like a Russian.
KGB. She gave him heel of her shoes.

334
00:28:06.521 --> 00:28:08.398
And he gave her a piece of the paper.

335
00:28:08.481 --> 00:28:12.819
- Was it microfilm?
- A coupon from Payless Shoes.

336
00:28:12.902 --> 00:28:15.280
Must be some kind of the code.

337
00:28:15.321 --> 00:28:20.034
You been spending too much time
inhaling them cleaning products.

338
00:28:20.118 --> 00:28:22.996
I'm warning you guys.
You watch yourself.

339
00:28:23.037 --> 00:28:27.917
This guy is here for a reason.
And I think that reason is us.

340
00:28:48.146 --> 00:28:49.439
Excuse me, buddy.

341
00:29:10.376 --> 00:29:11.878
What's going on?

342
00:29:11.961 --> 00:29:15.048
It's Navorski.
He's figured out the quarters.

343
00:29:38.446 --> 00:29:41.866
Good afternoon. Welcome to Burger King.
May I take your order?

344
00:29:45.245 --> 00:29:46.746
Keep the change.

345
00:30:06.599 --> 00:30:07.892
Excuse me.

346
00:30:12.564 --> 00:30:15.567
OK, go. Go.

347
00:30:17.527 --> 00:30:20.405
Good boy. Thank you.

348
00:30:21.531 --> 00:30:22.490

Brass band plays]

351
00:31:07.785 --> 00:31:11.497
"Crisis. Crisis in Krakozhia."

352
00:31:11.539 --> 00:31:13.541
Now that heavy fighting has subsided

353
00:31:13.583 --> 00:31:16.544
and both sides have dug in
for the long winter ahead,

354
00:31:16.628 --> 00:31:20.798
it's clear that the future of Krakozhia
may be in doubt for some time to come.

355
00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:24.511
Meanwhile, the people of Krakozhia
suffer the consequences.

356
00:31:24.594 --> 00:31:27.680
"And food.. in.."

357
00:31:27.764 --> 00:31:30.308
have caused food
and energy shortages.

358
00:31:30.391 --> 00:31:32.268
"In Krakozhia."

"The story of Broadway is the.."

"The cast of comedy hit Friends

361
00:32:09.597 --> 00:32:13.226
which is set in New York."

362
00:32:14.102 --> 00:32:18.481
Friends.

363
00:32:26.072 --> 00:32:29.534
Due to the heavy snowfall,
all flights have been cancelled..

"Wayne Newton is 61 today."

365
00:32:43.256 --> 00:32:45.175
"It's a miracle."

366
00:32:46.551 --> 00:32:51.264
"Korean conjoined twins
separated today in Maine."

367

"Chances of survival 50-50."

00:32:54.642 --> 00:32:55.852
50-50.

369
00:32:59.522 --> 00:33:01.691
Next.

370
00:33:03.193 --> 00:33:05.361
Let me ask you something,
Mr. Navorski.

371
00:33:05.403 --> 00:33:08.907
Why do you wait here every day
when there's nothing I can do for you?

372
00:33:08.948 --> 00:33:14.746
Your new visa will not arrive until
your country is recognized by the US.

373
00:33:14.829 --> 00:33:16.789
You have two stamp.

374
00:33:16.873 --> 00:33:19.709
One red, one green.

375
00:33:19.792 --> 00:33:25.048
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50-50.

376
00:33:28.593 --> 00:33:32.472
Yes. That's a beautiful way to look at
it, but America doesn't work that way.

377
00:33:46.236 --> 00:33:50.657
As acting Field Commissioner,
I've created a new position here at JFK.

378
00:33:50.698 --> 00:33:54.869
Transportation Liaison
for Passenger Assistance.

379
00:33:55.662 --> 00:33:58.915
Sir, what will that person do?

380
00:34:03.503 --> 00:34:06.422
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.

381
00:34:08.591 --> 00:34:12.220
I'm Transportation Liaison
in charge of Passenger Assistance.

382
00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.897
No carts, no quarters.
No quarters, no food.

383
00:34:22.981 --> 00:34:27.318
It'll be days before he goes through
the doors in violation of section 2.14

384
00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.320
Then he's somebody else's problem.

385
00:34:29.362 --> 00:34:32.365
Why don't we tag him
in violation of section 2.14 now?

386
00:34:32.448 --> 00:34:33.867
Then ship him to detention.

387
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:36.035
He has to break the law by leaving.

388
00:34:36.119 --> 00:34:39.330
I won't lie, particularly to get rid
of somebody like him.

389
00:35:14.073 --> 00:35:16.409
- Sorry, buddy.
- Honey!

390
00:35:38.264 --> 00:35:40.683
Put it down. Put it down.

391
00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:43.937
Put it down.

392
00:35:44.938 --> 00:35:48.441
You try to take my mop.
You try to take my floor.

393
00:35:48.525 --> 00:35:52.779
It's my job. Stay off my floor.
Stay away from my mop.

394
00:35:52.862 --> 00:35:55.406
- Food.
- If you touch it again, I kill you.

395
00:36:09.045 --> 00:36:11.297
Hey. I'm Enrique Cruz.

396
00:36:14.592 --> 00:36:16.511
We need to talk.

397
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:24.102
- I want to make a deal with you.
- What deal?

398
00:36:24.185 --> 00:36:27.438
I need information
on CBP Officer Torres.

399
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.400
You feed me information about her
and I'll feed you.

400
00:36:30.483 --> 00:36:33.778
- What do you want know?
- You see her every day.

401
00:36:33.862 --> 00:36:38.324
I want to know
what makes her knees weak.

402
00:36:38.366 --> 00:36:43.413
What makes her blood boil
and her body tingle.

403
00:36:43.496 --> 00:36:46.624
She's a wild stallion
and you'll help me break her.

404
00:36:46.708 --> 00:36:48.126
I'm..

405
00:36:48.209 --> 00:36:50.336
I'm her man of mystery.

406
00:36:50.378 --> 00:36:55.133
- Officer Torres is wild stallion?
- Her name is Delores.

407
00:36:55.216 --> 00:36:59.012
You help me to win her heart
and you'll never go hungry again.

408
00:37:01.347 --> 00:37:03.850
- I do this.
- Really? Promise?

409
00:37:03.933 --> 00:37:07.020
- Yes.
- OK. Thank you.

410
00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:10.064
What mean, "wild stallion"?

411
00:37:16.905 --> 00:37:20.325
Officer Torres.
My friend say you are stallion.

412
00:37:20.408 --> 00:37:22.327

413
00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:25.246
- A what?
- Stallion, like a horse.

414
00:37:25.288 --> 00:37:27.332
Stand behind the yellow line.

00:37:27.415 --> 00:37:30.043
- It's beautiful horse.

416
00:37:30.126 --> 00:37:35.006
- My friend drive the food.
- Mr. Navorski, behind the yellow line.

00:37:35.089 --> 00:37:38.051

She say one thing.

421
00:37:49.395 --> 00:37:53.525
- Very important.
- What? What did she tell you?

422
00:37:55.735 --> 00:37:57.529
Something wrong with the salmon?

423
00:37:57.570 --> 00:37:59.280
Need gorchitsa.

424
00:37:59.322 --> 00:38:00.448
What?

425
00:38:01.616 --> 00:38:02.659
Mustard. Mustard?

426
00:38:02.742 --> 00:38:05.453
- Mustard?
- Yes. Please.

427
00:38:09.541 --> 00:38:11.459
Thank you.

428
00:38:19.217 --> 00:38:21.970
Officer Torres, you like the films?

429
00:38:22.053 --> 00:38:24.305
- Movies?
- Not so much.

430
00:38:24.347 --> 00:38:27.475
- The Rockettes?
- Can't afford it.

431
00:38:27.517 --> 00:38:29.853
- What do you like?
- Conventions.

432
00:38:31.354 --> 00:38:33.439
Conventions. What is?

433
00:38:33.481 --> 00:38:37.986

She go to these conventions
dressed as Yeoman Rand.

436
00:38:46.578 --> 00:38:48.454
- Yeoman Rand.
- She's a Trekkie.

437
00:38:48.538 --> 00:38:51.583
Favorite episode
is Doomsday Machine.

438
00:38:57.046 --> 00:38:58.506
Now, listen, Viktor.

439
00:38:58.548 --> 00:39:01.050
You can ask her something
that is very important.

440
00:39:01.092 --> 00:39:02.635
- OK.
- Look..

441
00:39:11.019 --> 00:39:12.770

442
00:39:15.231 --> 00:39:16.441
Next.

443
00:39:19.777 --> 00:39:23.031
- Officer Torres.

00:39:25.909 --> 00:39:31.122
Man with money or man with love?

446
00:39:35.168 --> 00:39:37.086
What is choose?

447
00:39:41.257 --> 00:39:43.760
She had a boyfriend?

448
00:39:43.801 --> 00:39:46.721
For how long? Two years?

449
00:39:46.804 --> 00:39:48.181
What happened?

450
00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:50.725

00:40:03.655 --> 00:40:05.698

We say krushkach.

00:40:09.327 --> 00:40:11.621
One man, two womans.

458
00:40:11.663 --> 00:40:13.581
So. Mm.

459
00:40:14.374 --> 00:40:16.000
Crowded, you know.

460
00:40:17.252 --> 00:40:19.504
OK. He cheats.

00:40:27.971 --> 00:40:30.056
No. I won't cheat.

00:40:30.139 --> 00:40:33.268
She's a nice girl.
She won't take your chitting.

467
00:40:38.648 --> 00:40:39.607
Next.

468
00:40:40.775 --> 00:40:44.696
Officer Torres.
Have you been ever in the love?

469
00:40:44.779 --> 00:40:48.241
Enough, Viktor. Who is it?

470
00:40:48.283 --> 00:40:50.577
Who's telling you
to ask me these things?

471
00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:53.079
It's a man of misery.

472
00:40:55.748 --> 00:40:57.584
Misery?

473
00:40:57.625 --> 00:41:01.754
- Mystery?
- No, no. Misery. Man of misery.

474
00:41:02.505 --> 00:41:04.465
He's so sick. He's so in love.

475
00:41:06.426 --> 00:41:08.178
But what did she say?

476
00:41:08.261 --> 00:41:11.347
She did say, "Next! Next!"

477
00:41:11.431 --> 00:41:14.058
And now she say,
"Please. Please come."

478
00:41:14.142 --> 00:41:17.061
That's.. Wait.

479
00:41:20.899 --> 00:41:23.902
- I coming now.
- No, wait. Viktor.

480
00:41:23.985 --> 00:41:26.696
Viktor, just tell me more.

481
00:41:26.779 --> 00:41:28.698
I coming. I coming.

482
00:41:28.781 --> 00:41:30.658
Please, please.

483
00:41:47.008 --> 00:41:51.679
Beeper went off.
Started beeping. So, I grab. I come.

484
00:41:51.721 --> 00:41:54.390
We have an idea.

485
00:41:54.432 --> 00:41:56.559
Would you like something to eat?

486
00:41:56.601 --> 00:41:59.103
No. No food. I stuffed.

487
00:42:01.689 --> 00:42:04.067
OK. All right.

488
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:05.360
Thank you.

489
00:42:05.401 --> 00:42:09.030
So, Mr. Navorski,
I have some very good news for you.

490
00:42:09.113 --> 00:42:10.823
What?

491
00:42:10.865 --> 00:42:14.244
I've figured out a way
to get you out of this airport.

492
00:42:14.327 --> 00:42:15.912
How?

493
00:42:15.995 --> 00:42:19.999
Well, we have laws here
that protect aliens

494
00:42:20.041 --> 00:42:23.545
who have a credible fear
of returning to their own country.

495
00:42:23.628 --> 00:42:26.005
If we can establish this fear with you,

496
00:42:26.089 --> 00:42:31.427
then the CBP will be forced
to begin Expedited Removal Procedures,

497
00:42:31.511 --> 00:42:37.100
to bring you to an immigration judge
and let you plead your case for asylum.

498
00:42:37.183 --> 00:42:39.269
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.

499
00:42:39.352 --> 00:42:44.190
Unfortunately, the courts
are so backed up with asylum cases

500
00:42:44.274 --> 00:42:48.945
that the soonest you'd get before
a judge would be six months from now.

501
00:42:49.028 --> 00:42:52.574
Yes, and we would have no choice

502
00:42:52.615 --> 00:42:57.662
but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law. You'd be released.

503
00:42:57.745 --> 00:43:00.790
You would be free to wait
in New York until your court date.

504
00:43:00.874 --> 00:43:05.962
But, believe it or not, most people
never show up before the judge.

505
00:43:06.045 --> 00:43:09.799
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.

506
00:43:09.841 --> 00:43:12.135
You can go to New York City tonight.

507
00:43:12.177 --> 00:43:17.056
But, you only get to go
if we can establish a credible fear.

508
00:43:17.098 --> 00:43:18.725
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.

509
00:43:18.808 --> 00:43:20.268
- Fear.
- Fear.

510
00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:22.478
From what?

511
00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.314
That's the best part.

512
00:43:24.355 --> 00:43:28.651
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.

513
00:43:28.735 --> 00:43:31.154
So I'm going to ask you one question,

514
00:43:31.237 --> 00:43:35.325
if you give me the correct answer, I can
get you out of this airport tonight.

515
00:43:37.619 --> 00:43:39.537
So, I answer one question.

516
00:43:40.872 --> 00:43:43.208
Go to New York City. Tonight.

517
00:43:43.291 --> 00:43:46.294
- Tonight.
- Tonight.

518
00:43:49.923 --> 00:43:52.550
- OK.
- OK.

519
00:43:52.634 --> 00:43:53.760
All right.

520
00:43:53.801 --> 00:43:58.306
Do you, at this time, have any fear
of returning to your own country?

521
00:43:58.389 --> 00:44:00.266
No.

522
00:44:04.854 --> 00:44:07.190
OK. Let me try it again.

523
00:44:08.274 --> 00:44:11.027
- Your country's at war.
- Yes. War.

524
00:44:11.069 --> 00:44:14.405
There are men in the streets
with guns. Political persecution.

525
00:44:14.489 --> 00:44:16.783
- Yes. It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.

526
00:44:16.866 --> 00:44:18.993
And God only knows
what could happen.

527
00:44:19.035 --> 00:44:21.538
Innocent people
are torn from their beds.

528
00:44:21.621 --> 00:44:24.415
On Tuesdays. I hate Tuesdays.

529
00:44:24.457 --> 00:44:26.501
So you're afraid.

530
00:44:26.543 --> 00:44:29.629
- From what?
- Krakozhia.

531
00:44:29.712 --> 00:44:32.423
You're afraid of Krakozhia.

532
00:44:32.465 --> 00:44:34.425
Krakozhia?

533
00:44:34.509 --> 00:44:40.723
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.

534
00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:46.396
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.

535
00:44:46.479 --> 00:44:47.438
Human rights.

536
00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:52.151
Viktor, please don't be afraid
to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.

537
00:44:53.069 --> 00:44:57.407
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.

538
00:44:59.325 --> 00:45:03.121
So? I go to New York City now?

539
00:45:04.664 --> 00:45:06.583
- No.
- No?

540
00:45:08.751 --> 00:45:10.170
OK.

541
00:45:10.211 --> 00:45:14.174
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.

542
00:45:14.257 --> 00:45:17.218
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.

543
00:45:18.136 --> 00:45:22.640
I'm afraid from Wolfmens,
afraid from sharks.

544
00:45:22.682 --> 00:45:23.975
Thanks a lot.

545
00:45:29.147 --> 00:45:31.065
Damn.

546
00:45:34.068 --> 00:45:38.573
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.

547
00:45:40.283 --> 00:45:42.160
This is the only fun I have.

548
00:45:43.411 --> 00:45:47.290
A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?

549
00:45:47.373 --> 00:45:50.710
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.

550
00:45:50.752 --> 00:45:52.921
I take four back-to-back flights,

551
00:45:52.962 --> 00:45:56.925
fly 27 hours straight
literally around the world,

552
00:45:57.008 --> 00:46:00.720
and now you tell me you're going
to spend July 4th with your wife?

553
00:46:00.762 --> 00:46:02.680
The woman hates fireworks.

554
00:46:04.349 --> 00:46:07.018
Don't lie to me, OK?

555
00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:10.438
I know for a fact
you took her to Rome last weekend.

556
00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.899
Because you flew United, Max.

557
00:46:17.904 --> 00:46:21.074
South African Airlines
passenger Sharif AI-Calala,

558
00:46:21.115 --> 00:46:23.117
please come to the main ticket counter.

559
00:46:31.292 --> 00:46:35.964
You make a habit out of listening
to other people's conversations?

560
00:46:36.005 --> 00:46:39.008
No, I try to call home.

561
00:46:39.092 --> 00:46:41.553
So then..

562
00:46:42.428 --> 00:46:46.474
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.

563
00:46:49.686 --> 00:46:52.272
Because they're all liars.

564
00:46:52.939 --> 00:46:54.691
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

565
00:46:56.317 --> 00:46:57.777
Wet floor.

566
00:46:57.861 --> 00:46:59.445
Please. Don't be hurt.

567
00:46:59.487 --> 00:47:01.155
How can I not be? He's married.

568
00:47:01.239 --> 00:47:03.199
One man. Two womens. Crowded.

569
00:47:03.241 --> 00:47:05.201
You want to know
what the worst part is?

570
00:47:05.285 --> 00:47:09.330
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counseling.

571
00:47:09.414 --> 00:47:12.125
What kind of sick person am I?

572
00:47:12.208 --> 00:47:14.627
I'm rooting for the home team.

573
00:47:19.966 --> 00:47:22.343
I just wish the sex
wasn't so amazing.

574
00:47:25.096 --> 00:47:26.973
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.

575
00:47:28.141 --> 00:47:32.645
You know..
sometimes in the mornings,

576
00:47:32.729 --> 00:47:35.940
I just stare at him over room service.

577
00:47:35.982 --> 00:47:38.234
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.

578
00:47:39.777 --> 00:47:44.407
I start to think that maybe..
maybe this could happen.

579
00:47:46.409 --> 00:47:48.453
That we belong together.

580
00:47:51.122 --> 00:47:55.460
This.. man.. has you.

581
00:47:56.753 --> 00:48:00.798
Why he need.. puzzle?

582
00:48:02.425 --> 00:48:04.636
This is my problem.

583
00:48:04.677 --> 00:48:07.013
I always see men
the way I want to see them.

584
00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:15.146
Do I know you from someplace?

585
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:18.024
Sensible heels.
Payless Shoes. Second floor.

586
00:48:21.402 --> 00:48:23.196
Oh..

587
00:48:23.238 --> 00:48:25.156
You headed for home?

588
00:48:25.823 --> 00:48:28.910
Er.. No, no. I am..

589
00:48:28.952 --> 00:48:33.039
I am delayed a long time.

590
00:48:33.081 --> 00:48:37.001
I hate it when they delay flights.
What do you do?

591
00:48:37.085 --> 00:48:42.340
I go from one building
to another building.

592
00:48:42.423 --> 00:48:45.468
I have beeper.

593
00:48:45.552 --> 00:48:49.889
Oh, contractors.
You guys travel as much as we do.

594
00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.144
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.

595
00:48:55.228 --> 00:48:56.437
What's "BH"?

596
00:48:56.479 --> 00:48:58.398
In English..

597
00:48:59.858 --> 00:49:01.442
Viktor Navorski.

598
00:49:02.026 --> 00:49:06.823
- In English, Amelia Warren.
- Amelia Warren?

599
00:49:06.865 --> 00:49:08.908
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

600
00:49:08.992 --> 00:49:10.910
Nice to see you again.

601
00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:15.957
You like Italian food?

602
00:49:15.999 --> 00:49:18.877
I know, it's late
and you've probably got other plans,

603
00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:23.423
but if you'd like to grab some dinner,
we can run right out and catch a cab.

604
00:49:23.506 --> 00:49:26.801
I know a place
that has the greatest cannelloni.

605
00:49:26.885 --> 00:49:28.386
Erm..

606
00:49:28.469 --> 00:49:30.805
No, I.. I can't.

607
00:49:30.847 --> 00:49:32.640
- You married?
- No.

608
00:49:32.724 --> 00:49:35.560
- Girlfriend?
- No.

609
00:49:35.602 --> 00:49:40.899
I.. I can't go out.. with you.

610
00:49:43.985 --> 00:49:47.572
God. I am so.. I'm so sorry.

611
00:49:47.655 --> 00:49:48.865
I am so sorry.

612
00:49:48.948 --> 00:49:51.659
I must come off
like a complete nut job or something.

613
00:49:51.701 --> 00:49:54.871
- No.
- I didn't want to eat alone.

614
00:49:54.954 --> 00:49:56.873
Wet floor. Wet floor.

615
00:49:57.415 --> 00:50:00.043
- I..
- You don't have to explain.

616
00:50:00.126 --> 00:50:02.003
No, I.. Please, I..

617
00:50:05.131 --> 00:50:07.133
Wheelchair to gate A-five.

618
00:50:07.175 --> 00:50:08.426
Nadia.

619
00:50:08.468 --> 00:50:13.640
In New York restaurant,
what cost is cantaloni?

620
00:50:13.723 --> 00:50:15.767
I don't know. Maybe 15 bucks.

621
00:50:15.808 --> 00:50:17.977
- Dollars?
- 20.

622
00:50:18.061 --> 00:50:20.188
Two people, 40.

623
00:50:20.271 --> 00:50:22.190
Two people, 40 dollars.

624
00:50:30.156 --> 00:50:32.951
Two people, 40 dollars.

625
00:50:38.623 --> 00:50:41.918
I.. I.. help you?

626
00:50:42.001 --> 00:50:46.381
I'm so sorry, sir.
The position has already been filled.

627
00:50:51.803 --> 00:50:55.473
- Do you live nearby?
- Yes. Gate 67.

628
00:50:55.515 --> 00:51:00.603
Because we are very particular
about punctual.. Did you say Gate 67?

629
00:51:00.645 --> 00:51:02.480
Gate 67.

630
00:51:06.276 --> 00:51:08.194
You got to be kidding.

631
00:51:08.528 --> 00:51:12.782
You got to help me help you.
I don't see a Social Security number..

632
00:51:12.824 --> 00:51:15.410
mailing address,
even a phone number.

633
00:51:15.493 --> 00:51:20.081
Telephone? You need? I get.
I get. I get phone.

634
00:51:20.123 --> 00:51:22.041
I get.. I get phone.

635
00:51:31.759 --> 00:51:36.598
451-1226.

636
00:51:36.639 --> 00:51:39.601
All right.
When's the best time to reach you?

637
00:51:41.519 --> 00:51:42.520
Now?

638
00:52:13.426 --> 00:52:15.595
- Hello?
- Hi, Mr. Navorski.

639
00:52:15.678 --> 00:52:17.931
Yes, this is Viktor Navorski.
Who calls?

640
00:52:18.014 --> 00:52:20.391
It's Cliff from the Discovery Store.

641
00:52:20.475 --> 00:52:22.644
Cliff. Hello.

642
00:52:22.685 --> 00:52:24.229
- How's it going?
- Good.

643
00:52:24.312 --> 00:52:27.899
- Is this a good time?
- Yes, I wait for your call all day.

644
00:52:27.982 --> 00:52:31.444
Well, I got to tell you
that the position's been filled.

645
00:52:31.486 --> 00:52:35.031
Yeah, so could you please
go sit someplace else?

646
00:52:35.114 --> 00:52:37.909
- I go to bathroom now.
- That'd be good.

647
00:52:37.951 --> 00:52:39.244
- All right.
- Thank you.

648
00:52:39.327 --> 00:52:40.662
OK.

649
00:54:05.330 --> 00:54:07.749
Who is this?

650
00:54:07.832 --> 00:54:10.126
- Who are you?
- It's no one.

651
00:54:10.168 --> 00:54:13.713
There's no one here for
two weeks. This isn't one of my guys.

652
00:54:17.008 --> 00:54:21.513
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.

653
00:54:21.596 --> 00:54:24.307
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?

654
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:26.434
Does Harry think
he's running this job?

655
00:54:26.518 --> 00:54:28.603
- I go now.
- Go? Go where?

656
00:54:28.686 --> 00:54:31.147
- Gate 67.
- 67?

657
00:54:31.231 --> 00:54:33.274
We're ten months away from 67.

658
00:54:33.358 --> 00:54:36.694
He's got to be Harry's.
If he's not mine and he's not yours..

659
00:54:36.778 --> 00:54:39.113
Harry's trying to make me look bad.

660
00:54:39.155 --> 00:54:41.574
I've got to slow him down
before he gets to 67.

661
00:54:41.658 --> 00:54:44.327
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.

662
00:54:45.203 --> 00:54:47.580
Pull him off Harry's crew,
put him on mine.

663
00:54:47.664 --> 00:54:49.624
You start 6.30 Monday morning.

664
00:54:49.707 --> 00:54:52.293
You give me job?

665
00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:56.005
6.30, yes.. Boss.

666
00:55:34.627 --> 00:55:37.672
We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.

667
00:55:37.755 --> 00:55:40.258
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.

668
00:55:40.341 --> 00:55:41.801
OK. Just bring it.

669
00:55:41.843 --> 00:55:44.512
- Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.

670
00:55:44.596 --> 00:55:47.765
Look. The man without a country.

671
00:55:47.849 --> 00:55:49.726
Come on in. Welcome.

672
00:55:49.809 --> 00:55:52.604
- I see this.
- You did well.

673
00:55:53.104 --> 00:55:54.189
Have a seat.

674
00:55:54.272 --> 00:55:55.398
- Here?
- Here.

675
00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:56.816
Come on, sit down.

676
00:55:56.858 --> 00:56:01.154
- Who invited him?
- I did. We needed a fourth, right?

677
00:56:01.237 --> 00:56:04.240
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?

678
00:56:04.324 --> 00:56:07.202
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?

679
00:56:07.285 --> 00:56:11.789
He could be recording
everything we say. A wire in his shirt.

680
00:56:11.873 --> 00:56:14.125
A microphone up in his ass.

681
00:56:15.502 --> 00:56:20.006
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.

682
00:56:20.089 --> 00:56:22.759
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.

683
00:56:24.552 --> 00:56:26.429
Close your eyes.

684
00:56:36.231 --> 00:56:39.692
- OK. So you are clean.
- Good. Let's play cards.

685
00:56:39.776 --> 00:56:43.238
I will have money.
But.. Friday.

686
00:56:43.321 --> 00:56:47.116
Don't worry about it. We play for
unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.

687
00:56:47.158 --> 00:56:50.495
You'll be amazed
at what people leave at airports. Come.

688
00:56:50.578 --> 00:56:53.790
I have two nines and two nines.

689
00:56:53.831 --> 00:56:55.750
Four nines. Thank you.

690
00:56:57.001 --> 00:57:00.171
- Careful.
- Watch out.

691
00:57:00.213 --> 00:57:05.134
- We have a question for you.
- Yeah, we're just curious.

692
00:57:05.176 --> 00:57:06.970
What is in the can?

693
00:57:07.053 --> 00:57:09.597
- This?
- We saw the x-ray.

694
00:57:09.639 --> 00:57:11.683
We know there's no nuts in there.

695
00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:14.519
What is in there?

696
00:57:14.644 --> 00:57:16.563
This is jazz.

697
00:57:17.397 --> 00:57:19.107
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.

698
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:21.609
- Jazz?
- Yes.

699
00:57:23.319 --> 00:57:26.781
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.

700
00:57:26.865 --> 00:57:29.199
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.

701
00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:31.953
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys. OK.

702
00:57:32.036 --> 00:57:34.289
For tonight's grand prize, we have..

703
00:57:36.249 --> 00:57:38.001
Show them, Gupta.

704
00:57:38.084 --> 00:57:39.961
I found this upstairs.

705
00:57:40.003 --> 00:57:42.589
Virgin Air, first class lounge.

706
00:57:42.672 --> 00:57:44.591
There you go.

707
00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:47.010
And.. they belong to?

708
00:57:47.093 --> 00:57:48.720
Cher.

709
00:57:48.761 --> 00:57:50.263
Cher?

710
00:57:50.346 --> 00:57:51.764
As in.. Cher?

711
00:57:51.848 --> 00:57:53.099
Yeah. Cher.

712
00:57:53.183 --> 00:57:55.393
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.

713
00:57:55.435 --> 00:57:57.645
Those are Cher's panties.

714
00:57:57.729 --> 00:57:59.397
- Ready?
- Hurry up.

715
00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:02.025
So, will we share the panties?

716
00:58:02.108 --> 00:58:03.484
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.

717
00:58:03.568 --> 00:58:05.069
- Come on.
- Wait a second.

718
00:58:06.321 --> 00:58:10.408
United Airlines
flight number 801 to Narita

719
00:58:10.450 --> 00:58:12.535
is now announcing final boarding.

720
00:58:12.619 --> 00:58:16.039
"You can't.
That is mine."

721
00:58:17.999 --> 00:58:20.502
"You can get so confused."

722
00:58:20.585 --> 00:58:22.003
Viktor?

723
00:58:22.086 --> 00:58:23.421
Well, hi.

724
00:58:24.714 --> 00:58:25.673
Please.

725
00:58:25.757 --> 00:58:27.717
- How are you?
- Good.

726
00:58:27.759 --> 00:58:29.511
Man.

727
00:58:29.594 --> 00:58:34.182
I am so sorry about what happened
last time, asking you out like that.

728
00:58:34.265 --> 00:58:37.060
I'm so used to guys
trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet

729
00:58:37.143 --> 00:58:41.314
that when I meet somebody that doesn't,
I don't know how to react.

730
00:58:41.356 --> 00:58:43.525
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.

731
00:58:43.566 --> 00:58:46.110
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know. Both.

732
00:58:46.194 --> 00:58:48.112
Tell me about it.

733
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:49.781
Napoleon?

734
00:58:49.822 --> 00:58:55.578
Yeah. I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.

735
00:58:55.662 --> 00:58:58.665
Like 1200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.

736
00:58:58.748 --> 00:59:02.168
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah. He's one of my favorites.

737
00:59:03.169 --> 00:59:05.588
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.

738
00:59:05.672 --> 00:59:06.965
- His ego.
- Ego?

739
00:59:07.048 --> 00:59:08.049
Yes.

740
00:59:08.132 --> 00:59:10.385
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,

741
00:59:10.468 --> 00:59:14.430
Napoleon isolates himself
on the tiny island of Saint Helena.

742
00:59:14.472 --> 00:59:16.933
No one knows exactly
what happens next,

743
00:59:17.016 --> 00:59:19.227
but the version I like goes like this:

744
00:59:20.186 --> 00:59:23.523
He's very depressed
and decides to take his own life.

745
00:59:24.232 --> 00:59:28.194
But Napoleon believes himself
to be of such superhuman strength

746
00:59:28.236 --> 00:59:32.031
that he takes six times the amount
of poison needed to do the job.

747
00:59:32.073 --> 00:59:36.494
His stomach is so full up with poison
that his body rejects it,

748
00:59:36.536 --> 00:59:38.413
and he doesn't die.

749
00:59:38.454 --> 00:59:41.624
See? Ego. Saved his life.

750
00:59:41.708 --> 00:59:43.877
Maybe he need glasses.

751
00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:46.671
- Glasses?
- Yes. To read words on bottle.

752
00:59:46.754 --> 00:59:48.673
Poison.

753
00:59:50.258 --> 00:59:52.677
It's funny you should say that.

754
00:59:52.719 --> 00:59:55.346
Rumor has it
that Napoleon was farsighted.

755
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:56.973
- There you go.
- There you go.

756
00:59:57.056 --> 00:59:59.684
- There you go.
- And there you go.

757
00:59:59.767 --> 01:00:02.604
I think we're rewriting history
right here.

758
01:00:02.687 --> 01:00:04.606
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?

759
01:00:05.648 --> 01:00:08.526
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.

760
01:00:08.651 --> 01:00:10.570
I just did it again.

761
01:00:12.322 --> 01:00:14.741
I'm so..
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?

762
01:00:14.824 --> 01:00:18.536
I'm sick. I don't have the ability
to be alone for five seconds.

763
01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:19.537
OK.

764
01:00:20.705 --> 01:00:23.124
- OK, What?
- OK.

765
01:00:23.208 --> 01:00:25.168
Lunch.. with you.

766
01:00:26.628 --> 01:00:28.421
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.

767
01:00:28.505 --> 01:00:31.049
You're not running for a flight or..?

768
01:00:31.132 --> 01:00:32.509
I wait.

769
01:00:36.221 --> 01:00:38.223
- It's me.
- You. Yes.

770
01:00:38.306 --> 01:00:40.642
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.

771
01:00:40.683 --> 01:00:43.269
You work?

772
01:00:43.353 --> 01:00:45.104
- No.
- Ah.

773
01:00:45.188 --> 01:00:47.857
Three of you. Crowded.

774
01:00:47.941 --> 01:00:50.193
Stay away from me, Viktor.

775
01:00:51.277 --> 01:00:54.948
I'm.. I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.

776
01:00:55.031 --> 01:00:59.160
I just keep ingesting these poisonous
men until I make myself sick.

777
01:00:59.202 --> 01:01:01.996
- You're not sick, Amelia. No.
- No?

778
01:01:02.038 --> 01:01:05.250
No. You're a little.. farsighted.

779
01:01:08.378 --> 01:01:11.130
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.

780
01:01:11.214 --> 01:01:14.259
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.

781
01:01:30.024 --> 01:01:32.360
Your CBP inspection's in three days.

782
01:01:32.443 --> 01:01:35.321
The FBI and Homeland Security
will tour the airport,

783
01:01:35.363 --> 01:01:40.159
spend two hours observing these offices
before your interview process begins.

784
01:01:40.869 --> 01:01:42.787
How much does Navorski make?

785
01:01:43.997 --> 01:01:45.290
Sir?

786
01:01:45.331 --> 01:01:47.959
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?

787
01:01:49.252 --> 01:01:51.880
They're paying him cash under the table.

788
01:01:51.921 --> 01:01:54.090
I know that. How much?

789
01:01:55.091 --> 01:01:57.093
$19 an hour.

790
01:01:57.177 --> 01:02:01.139
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?

791
01:02:01.181 --> 01:02:03.224
That's New York City construction.

792
01:02:04.350 --> 01:02:06.895
One of my own men
came up to me the other day.

793
01:02:06.978 --> 01:02:09.606
Asked me
if I wanted to join the big pool.

794
01:02:09.647 --> 01:02:11.107
Look at him.

795
01:02:11.149 --> 01:02:14.360
Place a bet on when Navorski's
going to leave this airport.

796
01:02:14.444 --> 01:02:16.321
Have you heard about this?

797
01:02:18.198 --> 01:02:20.116
I have January 3rd.

798
01:02:24.204 --> 01:02:26.372
Bring him in.

799
01:02:26.414 --> 01:02:30.001
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK? No country.

800
01:02:30.043 --> 01:02:34.797
He's a national security risk, according
to my interpretation of Section 2.12.

801
01:02:34.881 --> 01:02:38.676
I want you to put him in a detention
center and run a clearance on him.

802
01:02:38.718 --> 01:02:40.637
That's all I want.

803
01:02:42.222 --> 01:02:44.098
What about a federal prison?

804
01:02:45.350 --> 01:02:48.144
What about another airport?

805
01:02:48.186 --> 01:02:50.563
Hello? Hello?

806
01:02:53.983 --> 01:02:57.237
We're detaining so many people,
there's no room anywhere.

807
01:02:57.904 --> 01:03:02.116
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody. Nobody'll take him.

808
01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.577
You want me to bring him back
to the terminal?

809
01:03:04.619 --> 01:03:08.039
No. From now on, Navorski lives here.

810
01:03:17.507 --> 01:03:23.096
The people who are coming here today
will be observing me, inspecting me.

811
01:03:23.888 --> 01:03:27.600
But most of all they will be looking
at the way that this airport is run.

812
01:03:27.642 --> 01:03:32.605
So let's show them why this is the
number-one airport in the United States.

813
01:03:32.689 --> 01:03:36.025
We process about 600 planes a day,

814
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:38.653
with a processing time
of 37 minutes per plane,

815
01:03:38.736 --> 01:03:40.613
about 60 seconds per passenger..

816
01:03:40.697 --> 01:03:43.157
to be brought into the country.

817
01:03:43.199 --> 01:03:46.536
We keep it as clean as possible.

818
01:03:46.619 --> 01:03:48.788
- What do you import?
- Computer software.

819
01:03:48.872 --> 01:03:50.331
That's a lot of walnuts.

820
01:03:50.373 --> 01:03:53.376
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.

821
01:03:53.459 --> 01:03:56.045
Every time I go to Brazil,
I bring her back a bag.

822
01:03:56.129 --> 01:03:58.798
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.

823
01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.758
Mind if I try one?

824
01:04:09.893 --> 01:04:12.770
How did you know
those weren't for his mother-in-law?

825
01:04:12.854 --> 01:04:14.647
If he's married,
where's his ring?

826
01:04:14.689 --> 01:04:17.901
And if he's divorced,
who still talks to their mother-in-law?

827
01:04:17.984 --> 01:04:22.113
I'm sorry, but really.
No of fence to mother-in-laws, but..

828
01:04:22.197 --> 01:04:23.907
- Sir.
- Yeah.

829
01:04:25.241 --> 01:04:27.660
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.

830
01:04:27.744 --> 01:04:30.079
- It'll have to wait.
- No. This won't wait.

831
01:04:30.163 --> 01:04:34.501
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they
found four prescriptions without an MPL.

832
01:04:34.584 --> 01:04:37.128
They tried to take the pills away
and he went nuts.

833
01:04:37.212 --> 01:04:39.797
There he is.
We think they're for his father.

834
01:04:39.839 --> 01:04:42.592
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.

835
01:04:42.675 --> 01:04:46.554
Everybody keep your weapons..
All right. We're here to help you.

836
01:04:46.638 --> 01:04:49.641
We're here to help you, sir.
All right. Give me the knife.

837
01:04:49.724 --> 01:04:51.351
- Where's he from?
- Russia.

838
01:04:51.434 --> 01:04:53.937
The only interpreter
we got is in Newark.

839
01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:57.565
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.

840
01:05:01.027 --> 01:05:02.946
Viktor.

841
01:05:03.655 --> 01:05:05.573
Viktor.

842
01:05:05.657 --> 01:05:08.159
Oh..

843
01:05:08.201 --> 01:05:10.119
I need your help.

844
01:05:11.246 --> 01:05:14.040
His name is Nlilodragovich.
He lives near you.

845
01:05:14.082 --> 01:05:15.833
He may not speak your dialect,

846
01:05:15.917 --> 01:05:18.211
but I need you to translate
and help me out.

847
01:05:18.253 --> 01:05:21.005
- I help you? Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.

848
01:05:21.089 --> 01:05:22.423
This guy's very upset.

849
01:05:22.507 --> 01:05:25.552
Just calm him down
and I'll let you back in the terminal.

850
01:05:25.593 --> 01:05:28.972
No. New York.
No red stamp. Green. I green.

851
01:05:29.138 --> 01:05:30.223
- New York.
- OK, yes.

852
01:05:30.306 --> 01:05:32.225
- You say yes?
- Yes.

853
01:05:32.308 --> 01:05:34.811
- OK. OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!

854
01:05:34.894 --> 01:05:38.857
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you. Go ahead.

855
01:05:39.023 --> 01:05:41.192
Stay out!

856
01:05:56.916 --> 01:05:58.126
So?

857
01:05:58.793 --> 01:06:03.590
OK, tell him in order to export
medicines from this country,

858
01:06:03.673 --> 01:06:09.846
he needs to have the proper form,
a Medicinal Purchase License.

859
01:06:09.888 --> 01:06:11.806
OK? You understand me, Viktor?

860
01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:37.457
He say he bring
the medicine for his father.

861
01:06:42.712 --> 01:06:46.841
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.

862
01:06:46.883 --> 01:06:48.134
It doesn't matter.

863
01:06:48.218 --> 01:06:52.972
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.

864
01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.611
He did not know
he need this document.

865
01:07:06.694 --> 01:07:08.780
No one say to him
he need document form.

866
01:07:08.863 --> 01:07:10.114
I'm saying it to him.

867
01:07:10.198 --> 01:07:15.411
He needs to have the form signed by
the hospital who is treating his father.

868
01:07:15.495 --> 01:07:18.456
These medicines
have to stay in the United States.

869
01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:19.832
They have to stay here.

870
01:07:36.516 --> 01:07:39.477
He.. He's begging you.

871
01:07:39.519 --> 01:07:41.855
I know. I can see that he's begging.

872
01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:47.360
I'm sorry, sir.

873
01:07:48.444 --> 01:07:53.366
You'll have to take a flight in the
morning. The medicine stays here.

874
01:07:54.450 --> 01:07:56.369
I'm sorry.

875
01:07:59.789 --> 01:08:01.583
Send him down!

876
01:08:06.713 --> 01:08:09.424
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job. Let's go.

877
01:08:14.596 --> 01:08:16.514
Whoa.

878
01:08:17.182 --> 01:08:18.683
Goat.

879
01:08:18.766 --> 01:08:23.479
- What?
- Goat. It medicine is for goat.

880
01:08:24.147 --> 01:08:29.277
- Goat?
- Yes. Medicine is for goat. Goat.

881
01:08:30.904 --> 01:08:33.198
- He said that?
- Yes.

882
01:08:33.281 --> 01:08:35.158
He say..

883
01:08:35.241 --> 01:08:39.037
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".

884
01:08:40.121 --> 01:08:42.749
Why? What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?

885
01:08:42.832 --> 01:08:45.960
- It's not for his dying father?
- No. No.

886
01:08:46.002 --> 01:08:51.508
The.. Krakozhia..
The name for "father"..

887
01:08:51.591 --> 01:08:53.927
Sound like "goat".

888
01:08:54.010 --> 01:08:55.929
I make mistake.

889
01:09:03.895 --> 01:09:05.855
Why are you doing this, Viktor?

890
01:09:05.897 --> 01:09:09.025
Medicine is for.. goat.

891
01:09:09.734 --> 01:09:11.277
- No, it's not.
- Yes.

892
01:09:11.361 --> 01:09:13.154
- No.
- Yes.

893
01:09:13.238 --> 01:09:15.323
You read the blue immigration form.

894
01:09:15.406 --> 01:09:16.407
- Blue?
- Yes. Blue.

895
01:09:16.449 --> 01:09:18.326
- Blue?
- Blue. The blue form.

896
01:09:18.368 --> 01:09:21.955
The one that says if it's an animal,
he doesn't need the license.

897
01:09:22.038 --> 01:09:26.000
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor. That's very good.

898
01:09:27.836 --> 01:09:30.296
Why are you doing this? Huh?

899
01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:33.216
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.

900
01:09:33.299 --> 01:09:35.552
Look at me.

901
01:09:35.635 --> 01:09:37.554
I was going to help you.

902
01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:42.976
Now I want you to ask him..
No, not you.

903
01:09:43.059 --> 01:09:45.895
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.

904
01:09:45.937 --> 01:09:49.858
I want to hear him say
who the medicine is for.

905
01:09:49.899 --> 01:09:52.777
Please. Who the medicine is for.

906
01:10:02.203 --> 01:10:06.332
Answer him, Mr. Nlilodragovich.
Who are the pills for?

907
01:10:12.797 --> 01:10:15.967
OK. The pills stay. He goes. That's it.

908
01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:22.849
Goat.

909
01:10:23.558 --> 01:10:26.144
Please. For goat.

910
01:10:26.227 --> 01:10:32.859
Medicine for goat.

911
01:10:34.819 --> 01:10:37.071
Give him the pills.

912
01:10:37.655 --> 01:10:39.574
Medicine for goat.

913
01:10:40.909 --> 01:10:42.827
Medicine..

914
01:10:52.462 --> 01:10:54.506
Come on now, it's all over.

915
01:10:54.589 --> 01:10:56.508
He love that goat.

916
01:10:59.969 --> 01:11:02.805
Do you think I need an excuse
to put you back in that cell

917
01:11:02.889 --> 01:11:04.807
to keep you there for five years?

918
01:11:04.891 --> 01:11:08.144
You go to war with me, and you go to war
with the United States.

919
01:11:08.186 --> 01:11:11.981
Then you'll know why Krakozhians
wait in line for cheap toilet paper

920
01:11:12.023 --> 01:11:15.235
while Uncle Sam wipes his ass
with Charmin two-ply.

921
01:11:23.826 --> 01:11:26.204
There was a 20 man.

922
01:11:26.287 --> 01:11:29.040
Immigration gun was drawn.

923
01:11:29.082 --> 01:11:31.959
The Dixon was ready to fire.

924
01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:34.587
To kill the little man with the pills.

925
01:11:35.588 --> 01:11:40.844
But then someone walks into the room
and stand in front of this little man.

926
01:11:40.927 --> 01:11:45.014
"Put the guns away," the man say.

927
01:11:45.098 --> 01:11:47.475
"Nobody Will die today."

928
01:11:47.517 --> 01:11:49.227
Who?

929
01:11:49.269 --> 01:11:52.021
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us. Who was it?

930
01:11:52.105 --> 01:11:54.023
Who was this man?

931
01:11:59.654 --> 01:12:03.616
Navorski. Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.

932
01:12:31.352 --> 01:12:35.023
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.

933
01:12:35.106 --> 01:12:39.736
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules
and concentrate on the people.

934
01:12:39.819 --> 01:12:40.945
The people, I know.

935
01:12:40.987 --> 01:12:44.407
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.

936
01:12:46.868 --> 01:12:49.204
You could learn
something from Navorski.

937
01:12:51.372 --> 01:12:54.292
Cheer up. it's not over yet.

938
01:13:19.567 --> 01:13:21.444
- Is that for me?
- Yes. Yes.

939
01:13:21.528 --> 01:13:25.240
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.

940
01:13:26.616 --> 01:13:30.411
For you.

941
01:13:30.954 --> 01:13:32.872
For wall.

942
01:13:33.665 --> 01:13:35.583
Fish for wall.

943
01:13:41.548 --> 01:13:43.675
Why do you want to go to New York?

944
01:13:44.759 --> 01:13:46.678
And what's in the can of peanuts?

945
01:13:50.223 --> 01:13:51.599
Promise.

946
01:13:52.517 --> 01:13:54.894
- A promise in the can?
- Yes. A promise.

947
01:13:57.605 --> 01:13:59.983
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.

948
01:14:00.066 --> 01:14:03.444
And this is a promise
that comes from a man who is stuck here.

949
01:14:03.528 --> 01:14:06.030
A man who may be stuck here
for the next ten years.

950
01:14:09.409 --> 01:14:13.204
From now on, you and I are partners.

951
01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:17.166
If I stay, you stay.

952
01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:21.171
You will not set one foot
in New York City.

953
01:14:22.088 --> 01:14:26.009
Not a single toe
in the United States of America.

954
01:14:27.343 --> 01:14:29.679
Do you understand
what I am saying to you?

955
01:14:31.264 --> 01:14:33.183
Yes.

956
01:14:34.058 --> 01:14:35.685
You don't like fish.

957
01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:59.792
Do you ever feel
like you're just living in an airport?

958
01:15:06.508 --> 01:15:10.178
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.

959
01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:12.263
I can mail you
anywhere in the US.

960
01:15:12.347 --> 01:15:15.683
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.

961
01:15:15.767 --> 01:15:19.729
- No. I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.

962
01:15:19.812 --> 01:15:21.856
- I do.
- What's her name?

963
01:15:21.898 --> 01:15:23.191
Amelia Warren.

964
01:15:23.274 --> 01:15:25.985
I thought we were looking
for a way out, not a way in.

965
01:15:26.069 --> 01:15:29.489
Be careful. Those flight attendants
ain't like regular women.

966
01:15:29.572 --> 01:15:33.743
Flying back and forth between time zones
messes with their biological clock.

967
01:15:33.785 --> 01:15:37.789
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.

968
01:15:37.872 --> 01:15:41.793
I am leaving.
They will come for us.

969
01:15:41.876 --> 01:15:44.254
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.

970
01:15:44.295 --> 01:15:47.173
You go in jail. Not me.

971
01:15:47.257 --> 01:15:49.092
For.. You know what? Forget it.

972
01:15:49.175 --> 01:15:50.885
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?

973
01:15:50.969 --> 01:15:52.679
- Yes. Yes.
- Warren.

974
01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.389
Amelia Jane Warren?

975
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:56.349
- Jane?
- Yeah.

976
01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:00.311
Way to go, Viktor. First class.

977
01:16:00.353 --> 01:16:03.940
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.

978
01:16:43.646 --> 01:16:46.858
Amelia,
would you like to get eat to bite?

979
01:16:48.902 --> 01:16:53.156
Bite to eat? Cantaloni?

980
01:17:02.165 --> 01:17:06.252
Bite to eat?

981
01:17:07.629 --> 01:17:09.464
Bite to eat?

982
01:17:12.884 --> 01:17:15.637
Eat to bite? Eat to bite.

983
01:17:15.678 --> 01:17:20.016
Bite to eat.

984
01:17:20.099 --> 01:17:22.143
Bite to eat. Bite to eat.

985
01:17:22.227 --> 01:17:24.270
Bite to eat. Bite to eat. Bite to eat.

986
01:17:24.312 --> 01:17:26.898
Bite to eat. Bite to eat.
Bite to eat. Bite to eat.

987
01:17:26.981 --> 01:17:29.609
Bite to eat. Bite to eat. Bite to eat..

988
01:17:34.739 --> 01:17:38.117
Gupta, you been ever married?

989
01:17:39.202 --> 01:17:42.079
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?

990
01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:47.752
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.

991
01:17:47.836 --> 01:17:50.129
Why?

992
01:17:50.213 --> 01:17:54.259
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.

993
01:17:54.342 --> 01:17:56.469
Made just enough money to survive.

994
01:17:56.553 --> 01:18:01.558
One day this policeman comes in
and tells me I owe him some tax.

995
01:18:01.599 --> 01:18:05.854
I said OK.
This is common. Sol pay him.

996
01:18:05.937 --> 01:18:10.567
The next day, the same policeman
come and keep coming and keep coming.

997
01:18:10.650 --> 01:18:14.487
And I am paying and I'm paying him
and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.

998
01:18:14.571 --> 01:18:19.868
And finally, on the fifth day, I take
a knife and I stab him in his chest.

999
01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:25.290
- You killed policeman?
- No. I just missed his heart.

1000
01:18:25.373 --> 01:18:27.584
When they tried to arrest me,
I run away.

1001
01:18:27.667 --> 01:18:30.712
So you never go home?

1002
01:18:30.795 --> 01:18:35.258
If I go home,
I go in the jail for seven years.

1003
01:18:37.719 --> 01:18:42.223
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.

1004
01:18:43.266 --> 01:18:47.604
As long as I keep
my floor clean, keep my head down,

1005
01:18:48.313 --> 01:18:50.523
they have no reason to deport me.

1006
01:18:50.607 --> 01:18:53.735
They have no reason
to notice a man like me.

1007
01:18:55.028 --> 01:19:01.534
United Airlines Flight 2703
from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.

1008
01:19:09.167 --> 01:19:11.920
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

1009
01:19:16.549 --> 01:19:18.468
No, no, no. It's wet.

1010
01:19:23.389 --> 01:19:25.683
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.

1011
01:19:25.725 --> 01:19:27.644
Watch out!

1012
01:19:31.481 --> 01:19:33.149
- Amelia.
- Viktor.

1013
01:19:33.233 --> 01:19:36.069
- Hello.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

1014
01:19:36.152 --> 01:19:37.695
He nearly killed me.

1015
01:19:37.737 --> 01:19:39.656
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

1016
01:19:41.407 --> 01:19:43.826
I love the suit.

1017
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:45.578
Hugo Boss.

1018
01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:47.830
On sale, $149.99

1019
01:19:48.456 --> 01:19:50.750
That's a bargain.

1020
01:19:50.833 --> 01:19:52.710
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.

1021
01:19:52.794 --> 01:19:54.546
And Josephine.

1022
01:19:54.587 --> 01:19:57.882
Do you know what Napoleon
gave Josephine on their wedding day?

1023
01:19:57.924 --> 01:19:59.467
Amelia?

1024
01:19:59.551 --> 01:20:04.138
Would you like to have eat to bite?

1025
01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:05.682
Food. Tonight?

1026
01:20:05.765 --> 01:20:08.268
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.

1027
01:20:08.351 --> 01:20:10.103
Yeah. Sure.

1028
01:20:10.186 --> 01:20:13.523
- What time?
- Dinnertime.

1029
01:20:13.565 --> 01:20:16.526
- Where do you want to go?
- I know place.

1030
01:20:26.452 --> 01:20:30.832
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.

1031
01:20:31.583 --> 01:20:33.501
This way, please.

1032
01:20:42.051 --> 01:20:43.970
Thank you.

1033
01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:47.849
I didn't know they had a patio up here.

1034
01:20:48.975 --> 01:20:50.894
It's very nice.

1035
01:21:09.746 --> 01:21:11.623
Good night.

1036
01:21:15.251 --> 01:21:17.712
Please. Please. Please. Please.

1037
01:21:17.754 --> 01:21:22.133
Sorry. So, tonight we have
cannellonis or chicken.

1038
01:21:22.217 --> 01:21:24.886
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.

1039
01:21:24.928 --> 01:21:26.846
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

1040
01:21:26.930 --> 01:21:28.723
For you, sir?

1041
01:21:28.765 --> 01:21:31.768
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.

1042
01:21:31.851 --> 01:21:33.770
I'll be back.

1043
01:21:47.283 --> 01:21:50.662
Let me see. Enjoy.

1044
01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:54.958
Did you know the croissant
was invented in Romania?

1045
01:21:55.041 --> 01:21:57.585
- Tell me.
- OK.

1046
01:21:57.669 --> 01:22:01.214
It's 1742
and the Turks invade Bucharest,

1047
01:22:01.256 --> 01:22:04.300
making a surprise attack
under the cover of night.

1048
01:22:04.384 --> 01:22:06.803
But the town bakers..

1049
01:22:08.638 --> 01:22:10.557
Sorry.

1050
01:22:26.698 --> 01:22:28.950
So, the bakers?

1051
01:22:29.033 --> 01:22:33.413
- No, never mind. It's a dumb story.
- No, please.

1052
01:22:33.496 --> 01:22:34.747
I'm sorry, Viktor.

1053
01:22:34.831 --> 01:22:38.626
Nobody really cares
where the croissant was invented.

1054
01:22:38.710 --> 01:22:42.130
I'll bet the Romanians themselves
don't give a shit.

1055
01:22:42.213 --> 01:22:43.506
I care.

1056
01:22:43.548 --> 01:22:46.259
Is histories. Is truth.

1057
01:22:47.343 --> 01:22:49.846
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.

1058
01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:52.182
- Yeah.
- No.

1059
01:22:52.265 --> 01:22:55.143
- That's the truth.
- You are not.

1060
01:22:55.185 --> 01:23:00.523
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of
the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.

1061
01:23:00.607 --> 01:23:02.901
I'm 39.

1062
01:23:02.984 --> 01:23:05.361
So? I was 39 once.

1063
01:23:06.613 --> 01:23:10.116
I was 18 years old
when I started working for the airlines.

1064
01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:12.619
I've been doing this over 20 years.

1065
01:23:12.702 --> 01:23:15.121
And now there's no more pretending.

1066
01:23:15.205 --> 01:23:17.081
This is it.

1067
01:23:17.165 --> 01:23:22.128
It's why my address book is by city
and my pager goes off during dinner.

1068
01:23:25.465 --> 01:23:28.676
You can switch off pager.

1069
01:23:29.844 --> 01:23:31.304
I wish I could.

1070
01:23:31.346 --> 01:23:34.807
I've been waiting for a phone call
for seven years.

1071
01:23:34.849 --> 01:23:39.062
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.

1072
01:23:39.812 --> 01:23:44.400
That's why I live out of hotels and have
my little suitcase packed, ready to go,

1073
01:23:44.442 --> 01:23:46.819
just in case
he wants to meet me for the weekend.

1074
01:23:47.987 --> 01:23:49.864
Yeah.

1075
01:23:50.406 --> 01:23:52.325
I've been waiting my whole life.

1076
01:23:55.537 --> 01:23:59.541
Just don't know what the hell for.

1077
01:24:01.668 --> 01:24:03.586
I'm so sorry.

1078
01:24:20.895 --> 01:24:23.231
I live here.

1079
01:24:23.314 --> 01:24:25.358
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.

1080
01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:27.318
Gate 67.

1081
01:24:28.152 --> 01:24:31.197
- You live at the airport?
- Yes. Day and night.

1082
01:24:31.239 --> 01:24:34.659
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.

1083
01:24:34.742 --> 01:24:36.452
So I wait.

1084
01:24:36.536 --> 01:24:39.247
All frequent fliers
feel the same way you do, Viktor.

1085
01:24:39.330 --> 01:24:41.541
Everybody's waiting. Everybody.

1086
01:24:41.583 --> 01:24:46.087
- For a flight, for a meeting..
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.

1087
01:24:46.171 --> 01:24:48.548
Then what are you waiting for?

1088
01:24:51.676 --> 01:24:54.512
Is OK. I understand.

1089
01:24:57.849 --> 01:24:59.767
I have an idea.

1090
01:25:00.894 --> 01:25:03.521
- Come here.
- What you do?

1091
01:25:05.732 --> 01:25:06.983
You sure?

1092
01:25:07.025 --> 01:25:09.485
More than anything, I'm sure of this.

1093
01:25:09.569 --> 01:25:11.446
Ready?

1094
01:25:25.919 --> 01:25:28.880
So, when do you come back?

1095
01:25:28.922 --> 01:25:32.133
13 days. How about you?

1096
01:25:32.175 --> 01:25:34.802
I will be here.

1097
01:25:34.844 --> 01:25:37.222
But what if your schedule changes?

1098
01:25:37.263 --> 01:25:39.724
Maybe we should
exchange phone numbers.

1099
01:25:39.807 --> 01:25:42.644
No. I will be here.

1100
01:25:43.186 --> 01:25:47.899
You know what Napoleon give
to Josephine when he win Bavaria?

1101
01:25:48.608 --> 01:25:50.527
Tell me.

1102
01:25:51.194 --> 01:25:52.570
Come on. Tell me.

1103
01:25:52.612 --> 01:25:56.950
I will show you. 13 days from now.

1104
01:27:03.183 --> 01:27:04.475
What's he doing?

1105
01:27:04.559 --> 01:27:08.062
I can't ask him. I'm supposed
to tell him what he's doing.

1106
01:27:08.146 --> 01:27:09.939
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.

1107
01:27:26.831 --> 01:27:31.002
I'm sorry. Sorry.
You got to do this for me.

1108
01:27:31.044 --> 01:27:34.339
You'll get really fat
with all the food I'm going to give you.

1109
01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:38.801
But, please, do this for me. It will be
the last thing I ask you to do.

1110
01:27:56.736 --> 01:28:00.490
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.

1111
01:28:04.577 --> 01:28:09.457
- I have to work.
- He will wait.

1112
01:29:10.852 --> 01:29:12.729
- How was your flight?
- Good.

1113
01:29:14.022 --> 01:29:15.940
Thanks.

1114
01:29:19.736 --> 01:29:23.281
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.

1115
01:29:23.323 --> 01:29:26.618
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.

1116
01:29:26.701 --> 01:29:28.578
Please follow me.

1117
01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:30.538
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.

1118
01:29:52.894 --> 01:29:56.022
In my line of work,
there are three things that matter.

1119
01:29:56.105 --> 01:30:00.902
The person, the document and the story.

1120
01:30:02.654 --> 01:30:06.699
Find the truth of one
and you find the truth of all three.

1121
01:30:06.783 --> 01:30:09.035
I need your help finding the truth.

1122
01:30:10.828 --> 01:30:13.873
Do you know a man
named Viktor Navorski?

1123
01:30:13.915 --> 01:30:15.416
Yes.

1124
01:30:16.084 --> 01:30:18.962
Do you know why he's here
and where he's from?

1125
01:30:19.045 --> 01:30:21.798
No. We're just friends.

1126
01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:27.679
Have you noticed that he hides a can
of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?

1127
01:30:27.762 --> 01:30:29.097
So?

1128
01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:31.099
What do you make of that?

1129
01:30:32.767 --> 01:30:34.936
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.

1130
01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:40.775
We know that he's planning to go
to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.

1131
01:30:40.817 --> 01:30:43.027
Has he told you why he's in New York?

1132
01:30:43.069 --> 01:30:44.319
No.

1133
01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:48.116
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No. We just met at the airport.

1134
01:30:48.157 --> 01:30:51.911
All I know is that he's a building
contractor, living out of a suitcase.

1135
01:30:51.995 --> 01:30:53.246
That's it.

1136
01:30:53.329 --> 01:30:55.665
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.

1137
01:30:55.748 --> 01:30:57.667
That's what he said?

1138
01:31:00.587 --> 01:31:04.382
Amelia. I'm just curious.

1139
01:31:04.465 --> 01:31:08.428
You are the kind of woman
who can get any guy she wants.

1140
01:31:11.014 --> 01:31:13.099
Why Viktor Navorski?

1141
01:31:15.018 --> 01:31:19.355
That's something a guy like you
could never understand.

1142
01:31:41.711 --> 01:31:46.216
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.

1143
01:31:46.257 --> 01:31:48.426
Please. Sit.

1144
01:31:48.468 --> 01:31:51.387
It's OK, Viktor. All men lie.

1145
01:31:51.471 --> 01:31:54.849
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.

1146
01:31:54.933 --> 01:31:58.520
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.

1147
01:31:59.521 --> 01:32:02.607
Maybe you see the man
the way you want see the man.

1148
01:32:02.690 --> 01:32:06.736
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?

1149
01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:09.572
- I..
- Unacceptable?

1150
01:32:09.656 --> 01:32:11.824
Yes. Yes.

1151
01:32:11.908 --> 01:32:13.826
You want to hear the funny part?

1152
01:32:14.536 --> 01:32:16.246
I broke up with him.

1153
01:32:16.287 --> 01:32:18.831
I was coming here to tell you
he's out of my life.

1154
01:32:18.873 --> 01:32:22.669
I'm free. I got tired of waiting.

1155
01:32:22.752 --> 01:32:24.671
At least we have that in common.

1156
01:32:29.217 --> 01:32:34.848
Amelia, you know what Napoleon
give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?

1157
01:32:36.599 --> 01:32:38.059
No.

1158
01:32:38.142 --> 01:32:40.186
I show you.

1159
01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:46.401
Please. Please.

1160
01:32:50.154 --> 01:32:52.073
Sit. Please.

1161
01:33:03.126 --> 01:33:07.672
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.

1162
01:33:07.714 --> 01:33:10.175
One thousand fountains.

1163
01:33:11.843 --> 01:33:13.386
You built this for me?

1164
01:33:13.469 --> 01:33:18.183
Please. Sit. Don't get wet.

1165
01:33:27.483 --> 01:33:29.402
Come on.

1166
01:33:30.486 --> 01:33:32.822
Oh..

1167
01:33:32.906 --> 01:33:33.990
It no work.

1168
01:33:34.073 --> 01:33:38.786
It should shoot,
big water up to ceiling.

1169
01:33:40.163 --> 01:33:45.001
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?

1170
01:33:48.796 --> 01:33:50.673
Are you a criminal?

1171
01:33:53.635 --> 01:33:55.345
You're living here, Viktor.

1172
01:33:55.386 --> 01:33:59.307
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.

1173
01:33:59.349 --> 01:34:01.267
Here. I show you.

1174
01:34:12.612 --> 01:34:13.988
My father.

1175
01:34:14.072 --> 01:34:17.200
Viktor, please tell me
your father isn't in that peanut can.

1176
01:34:24.332 --> 01:34:26.251
This is jazz.

1177
01:34:32.465 --> 01:34:35.218
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski,

1178
01:34:35.301 --> 01:34:39.973
see this photograph
in Hungarian newspaper 1958.

1179
01:34:41.099 --> 01:34:43.726
He say he look at photograph
for seven days.

1180
01:34:43.810 --> 01:34:45.687
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday..

1181
01:34:46.229 --> 01:34:48.106
Who are they?

1182
01:34:48.273 --> 01:34:51.734
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie,
Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,

1183
01:34:51.818 --> 01:34:53.695
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.

1184
01:34:53.778 --> 01:34:56.197
57 of them all together.

1185
01:34:56.281 --> 01:35:00.618
After looking at photograph
for seven days, my father has idea.

1186
01:35:00.702 --> 01:35:05.540
He begin to write letters to club,
Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.

1187
01:35:05.582 --> 01:35:10.712
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.

1188
01:35:10.753 --> 01:35:12.672
And then he wait.

1189
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:17.260
He wait month, week, year.

1190
01:35:17.302 --> 01:35:20.221
My father wait 40 year.

1191
01:35:24.559 --> 01:35:26.811
And they all sign names.

1192
01:35:29.772 --> 01:35:31.774
One by one.

1193
01:35:46.831 --> 01:35:51.294
They all write their name
and send it to my father.

1194
01:35:57.467 --> 01:35:59.385
All but not one.

1195
01:36:01.262 --> 01:36:03.014
Benny Golson

1196
01:36:06.434 --> 01:36:08.394
Saxophone.

1197
01:36:08.478 --> 01:36:13.525
My father die before Benny Golson
write his name and send to my father.

1198
01:36:13.566 --> 01:36:17.320
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.

1199
01:36:21.032 --> 01:36:26.329
I promise I will go New York,
find Benny Golson,

1200
01:36:26.371 --> 01:36:29.165
have him write name to put in can.

1201
01:36:30.041 --> 01:36:33.753
And you've been living here
so you could do this for your father?

1202
01:36:34.379 --> 01:36:36.297
Maybe I think he do it for me.

1203
01:36:42.178 --> 01:36:45.849
You say you are waiting for something.

1204
01:36:47.183 --> 01:36:50.854
And I say to you,
"Yes, yes. We all wait".

1205
01:36:54.232 --> 01:36:56.150
What are you waiting for?

1206
01:36:58.152 --> 01:37:02.240
You. I wait for you.

1207
01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:58.213
What?

1208
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:04.636
The war is over.

1209
01:38:04.719 --> 01:38:08.264
The right-wing military coup
that ousted President Vagobagin..

1210
01:38:33.706 --> 01:38:36.751
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.

1211
01:38:36.793 --> 01:38:40.547
Let's have a toast to my friend,
Viktor "The Goat".

1212
01:38:42.674 --> 01:38:44.759
May he never lose his country again.

1213
01:38:45.426 --> 01:38:46.845
Krakozhia!

1214
01:38:46.886 --> 01:38:50.682
Amelia! You here early!

1215
01:38:50.723 --> 01:38:52.934
Hello. Amelia, look.

1216
01:38:53.017 --> 01:38:55.520
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace. Come.

1217
01:38:55.562 --> 01:38:58.439
See, the war,
the war Krakozhia is over.

1218
01:38:58.481 --> 01:39:01.067
Peace. The war is over.

1219
01:39:04.779 --> 01:39:07.991
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.

1220
01:39:08.032 --> 01:39:10.702
He has a lot of connections. Here.

1221
01:39:10.785 --> 01:39:12.370
It's a pass, Viktor.

1222
01:39:12.453 --> 01:39:15.248
A one-day travel emergency visa
with your name on it.

1223
01:39:15.331 --> 01:39:17.000
- Wha.. Visa?
- Yes.

1224
01:39:17.083 --> 01:39:19.169
- From your friend?
- Yeah.

1225
01:39:19.252 --> 01:39:23.089
Just go to New York, find that last name
and put it in the can.

1226
01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:24.924
- I go New York?
- Yes.

1227
01:39:25.008 --> 01:39:26.509
I go New York!

1228
01:39:34.309 --> 01:39:37.645
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.

1229
01:39:40.607 --> 01:39:45.278
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?

1230
01:39:47.197 --> 01:39:49.115
He did it for me.

1231
01:39:51.034 --> 01:39:54.954
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.

1232
01:39:55.038 --> 01:39:58.708
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.

1233
01:39:58.791 --> 01:40:01.294
I not confused.. Not this. Not this.

1234
01:40:03.421 --> 01:40:07.050
I'm sorry. I'm running late.

1235
01:40:07.133 --> 01:40:10.053
Amelia. Why you go? Why you go?

1236
01:40:11.513 --> 01:40:14.807
You know what Napoleon
gave Josephine as a wedding present?

1237
01:40:14.891 --> 01:40:16.893
It was a gold locket.

1238
01:40:16.935 --> 01:40:20.146
And on the inside,
he made an inscription.

1239
01:40:24.734 --> 01:40:26.736
"Destiny".

1240
01:40:29.364 --> 01:40:31.282
Destiny.

1241
01:40:33.409 --> 01:40:36.579
Rejoice in the streets
as well as in their local taverns.

1242
01:40:36.621 --> 01:40:41.251
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye
from high atop the parliament buildings.

1243
01:40:41.334 --> 01:40:43.294
It is a clear sign of the power..

1244
01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:48.007
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

1245
01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:50.051
I missed you.

1246
01:40:53.096 --> 01:40:54.973
Come on.

1247
01:41:07.318 --> 01:41:08.736
Next.

1248
01:41:09.445 --> 01:41:11.364
Viktor.

1249
01:41:13.241 --> 01:41:16.578
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?

1250
01:41:17.495 --> 01:41:19.414
What do you have here?

1251
01:41:23.376 --> 01:41:25.295
What do you have here?

1252
01:41:34.679 --> 01:41:36.681
Oh, no. It's not signed.

1253
01:41:38.224 --> 01:41:40.018
What?

1254
01:41:40.101 --> 01:41:42.770
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.

1255
01:41:42.854 --> 01:41:47.233
To validate authenticity, it needs
to be signed by the supervising officer.

1256
01:41:47.817 --> 01:41:49.694
Dixon?

1257
01:41:49.861 --> 01:41:51.029
Yes.

1258
01:41:51.112 --> 01:41:53.698
Dixon.

1259
01:41:57.076 --> 01:42:00.788
The war in my country is over.

1260
01:42:01.873 --> 01:42:06.628
Yeah. I know. Congratulations.

1261
01:42:06.711 --> 01:42:08.588
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?

1262
01:42:09.714 --> 01:42:11.966
When you wait so long for one thing?

1263
01:42:12.967 --> 01:42:15.261
One tiny moment.

1264
01:42:15.345 --> 01:42:17.847
I had that moment today, too.

1265
01:42:17.889 --> 01:42:20.099
You see this badge?

1266
01:42:20.141 --> 01:42:23.853
This badge means that I was made
CBP Field Commissioner.

1267
01:42:23.937 --> 01:42:28.733
It means that my authority over the
security of this airport is absolute.

1268
01:42:30.068 --> 01:42:32.362
Your ticket and your passport.

1269
01:42:34.906 --> 01:42:37.200
It's time for you to go home.

1270
01:42:40.995 --> 01:42:44.499
Officer Waylin, please show
Mr. Navorski into the terminal

1271
01:42:44.582 --> 01:42:47.377
and make sure
he does not miss his flight.

1272
01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:49.379
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.

1273
01:42:59.597 --> 01:43:01.516
I think I want go New York City.

1274
01:43:03.810 --> 01:43:05.854
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.

1275
01:43:05.937 --> 01:43:08.773
I no more "unacceptable".

1276
01:43:08.815 --> 01:43:12.193
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.

1277
01:43:14.737 --> 01:43:16.656
Are you sure you want to do that?

1278
01:43:18.408 --> 01:43:20.326
I go New York City now.

1279
01:43:25.081 --> 01:43:30.336
Part of my job is to get rid of
undesirables, and there are quite a few.

1280
01:43:31.504 --> 01:43:33.965
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.

1281
01:43:34.048 --> 01:43:38.011
He's been here for 20 years, but he's
been running an after-hour poker game.

1282
01:43:38.094 --> 01:43:40.096
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.

1283
01:43:40.138 --> 01:43:44.058
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.

1284
01:43:44.142 --> 01:43:45.185
Yep.

1285
01:43:45.268 --> 01:43:49.939
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.

1286
01:43:50.023 --> 01:43:54.819
Enrique has been letting people
into the food preparation area.

1287
01:43:54.861 --> 01:43:56.779
That's a major security breach.

1288
01:43:56.821 --> 01:43:58.865
The poor guy, I think he's a newly Wed.

1289
01:43:58.948 --> 01:44:00.950
But I'm going to have to let him go.

1290
01:44:01.034 --> 01:44:05.538
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.

1291
01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:09.918
But he's wanted for assaulting
a police officer back in India in 1979.

1292
01:44:11.336 --> 01:44:13.421
I'll have to deport him.

1293
01:44:13.505 --> 01:44:15.423
I will go home.

1294
01:44:16.299 --> 01:44:19.844
- I'm sorry. What did you say?
- I will go home.

1295
01:44:19.928 --> 01:44:21.846
Leave them alone. I will go.

1296
01:44:22.639 --> 01:44:24.224
- Today.
- Yes.

1297
01:44:24.307 --> 01:44:27.227
If you don't get on that plane,
they're all gone.

1298
01:44:27.310 --> 01:44:29.062
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1299
01:44:29.103 --> 01:44:30.772
OK. Good.

1300
01:44:32.357 --> 01:44:34.025
Your attention please.

1301
01:44:34.067 --> 01:44:39.739
Immediate boarding, gate B-20, for
flight number 309 Air Canada to Ottawa.

1302
01:44:44.077 --> 01:44:45.328
I don't believe you.

1303
01:44:45.411 --> 01:44:48.915
- Viktor, you don't have to do this.
- You can fight these guys.

1304
01:44:48.998 --> 01:44:51.835
- We'll help you.
- Viktor, come on. I owe you so much.

1305
01:44:51.876 --> 01:44:54.796
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.

1306
01:44:54.879 --> 01:44:57.757
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.

1307
01:45:02.178 --> 01:45:03.137
Gupta.

1308
01:45:03.179 --> 01:45:04.722
Good bye.

1309
01:45:04.764 --> 01:45:07.600
You try to fool us.

1310
01:45:07.642 --> 01:45:12.105
You make us to think you would walk out,
that you will fight with them.

1311
01:45:12.188 --> 01:45:13.815
Why don't you fight?

1312
01:45:13.898 --> 01:45:18.403
- The war is over.
- Then go. Get lost.

1313
01:45:18.486 --> 01:45:22.866
Get lost. Go home
and tell them you never made it.

1314
01:45:22.949 --> 01:45:26.828
You come this close to America,

1315
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:30.957
but you don't have the courage
to go from here to here.

1316
01:45:32.333 --> 01:45:34.043
You are a coward.

1317
01:45:34.127 --> 01:45:36.838
The plane is on time.

1318
01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:39.090
You are a coward.

1319
01:45:39.716 --> 01:45:42.135
You are a coward!

1320
01:45:42.218 --> 01:45:43.761
You make me sick!

1321
01:45:43.845 --> 01:45:47.140
What's wrong with you, man?
Settle down.

1322
01:45:47.182 --> 01:45:50.977
Got people looking all around,
looking at me like I'm..

1323
01:45:53.188 --> 01:45:54.564
Look at me.

1324
01:45:55.398 --> 01:45:57.317
Come on, look at me.

1325
01:46:01.738 --> 01:46:03.907
There's something you should know.

1326
01:46:07.744 --> 01:46:10.663
Ladies and gentlemen,
United Airlines Flight 865

1327
01:46:10.747 --> 01:46:14.125
from Krakozhia has landed
and is now taxiing to the gate.

1328
01:46:14.209 --> 01:46:17.795
For those passengers holding tickets
for Flight 866 to Krakozhia,

1329
01:46:17.879 --> 01:46:20.256
we expect departure
to be on schedule.

1330
01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:37.440
Get back, please.

1331
01:46:46.908 --> 01:46:48.117
Gupta.

1332
01:46:59.838 --> 01:47:01.756
Gupta!

1333
01:47:32.287 --> 01:47:34.205
I am going home.

1334
01:47:38.543 --> 01:47:40.503
Get lost.

1335
01:47:51.055 --> 01:47:52.974
Your attention, please.

1336
01:47:53.057 --> 01:47:57.937
Flight 866 to Krakozhia
will be delayed until further notice.

1337
01:48:06.070 --> 01:48:08.573
Do you have an appointment?

1338
01:48:10.825 --> 01:48:13.536
Somebody tell me
what the hell is going on down there!

1339
01:48:16.372 --> 01:48:18.291
We're right behind you.

1340
01:48:22.420 --> 01:48:23.796
Viktor's leaving.

1341
01:48:38.102 --> 01:48:41.481
- Monica, Viktor's leaving.
- I know. He's going home.

1342
01:48:41.523 --> 01:48:43.942
He's going for the front door,
out to the city.

1343
01:48:43.983 --> 01:48:45.443
What?

1344
01:48:54.577 --> 01:48:56.579
Viktor. Remember us.

1345
01:48:56.621 --> 01:48:59.165
From the Discovery Store,
I want to give you this.

1346
01:48:59.249 --> 01:49:00.375
It's good luck.

1347
01:49:00.458 --> 01:49:02.335
A digital camera for cousin Katia.

1348
01:49:02.418 --> 01:49:06.005
I don't know where you're going,
but these will keep your feet warm.

1349
01:49:14.806 --> 01:49:17.267
- Everybody in position?
- We're here.

1350
01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:18.768
Secure the door.

1351
01:49:30.363 --> 01:49:32.282
Sorry, Viktor.

1352
01:49:35.577 --> 01:49:36.703
Take him, Judge.

1353
01:49:38.037 --> 01:49:41.249
Hold it, Viktor. Take it easy.

1354
01:49:42.792 --> 01:49:44.918
You see those doors?

1355
01:49:44.919 --> 01:49:47.422
Those are the entry doors
to New York City.

1356
01:49:47.505 --> 01:49:50.800
To the United States of America.
Turn around.

1357
01:50:00.226 --> 01:50:03.605
It's snowing in the city
and you're going to need that.

1358
01:50:07.442 --> 01:50:08.401
Good luck.

1359
01:50:09.277 --> 01:50:12.155
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

1360
01:50:12.238 --> 01:50:13.781
Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no.

1361
01:50:13.865 --> 01:50:15.200
I'm going to miss you.

1362
01:50:15.241 --> 01:50:17.452
Try not to get stuck
wherever you're going.

1363
01:50:17.535 --> 01:50:19.412
Arrest him! Arrest him!

1364
01:50:19.495 --> 01:50:22.248
