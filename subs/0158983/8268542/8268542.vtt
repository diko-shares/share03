the movie with Terrence and Phillip.

168
00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:43.855
Who wants to touch me?

169
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.608
I said, fuck,
who wants to touch me?!

170
00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:51.947
Come on, bros! Let's go see
a movie with Terrence and Phillip.

171
00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:55.825
Kenny, you are so annoying!

172
00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:02.916
♪ You're an uncle, you're an uncle ♪
♪ uncle fucker! ♪

173
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.127
♪ Cocksucker and cum-sucker, ♪
♪ fuck, motherfucker! ♪

174
00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:10.924
Okay, kids, take your seats.
There's a lot to learn today.

175
00:09:11.467 --> 00:09:13.301
That's right, Mr. Hat.

176
00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:16.721
Okay, kids, let's start the day
with some new math problems.

177
00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:18.723
What's five two?

178
00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:23.770
Don't be shy.
Just give it some thought.

179
00:09:23.854 --> 00:09:25.397
- Well, Clyde?
- Twelve?

180
00:09:25.481 --> 00:09:27.232
All right. (chuckles) Let's, uh.
let's see if we can find out the answer

181
00:09:27.316 --> 00:09:29.568
from someone who's not a complete moron.

182
00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:31.987
Anyone?
Come on, don't be shy.

183
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:34.573
I know the answer, Mr. Garrison!

184
00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:37.450
- Shut up, fatty!
- Hey! Don't call me fat, you fucking Jew!

185
00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:39.661
Eric! Did you just
said the "X" word?

186
00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:41.705
- "Jew"?
- He meant "cocksucker"!

187
00:09:41.789 --> 00:09:43.475
You can't say "dick" in school,
you fucking fat fuck!

188
00:09:43.499 --> 00:09:44.958
- Kyle!
- Why the fuck not?!

189
00:09:45.042 --> 00:09:46.751
- Eric!
- Shit, you said "dick" again!

190
00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:48.044
Stanley!

191
00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:49.379
- Kenny!
- What's the matter?

192
00:09:49.463 --> 00:09:51.650
It won't hurt anybody!
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

193
00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:54.134
How about
a visit to the school counselor?

194
00:09:54.218 --> 00:09:56.845
How about sucking my balls?

195
00:09:57.513 --> 00:09:59.139
What did you say?!

196
00:09:59.223 --> 00:10:02.517
Uh, uh. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
What I actually said was.

197
00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:07.647
"How would you like to suck my balls,
Mr. Garrison?"

198
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:10.066
Holy shit, man.

199
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:11.950
PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE

200
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.989
I'm very
upset boys, okay?

201
00:10:16.073 --> 00:10:17.699
You should be ashamed of yourself.

202
00:10:17.783 --> 00:10:19.344
I've already called your mothers and, uh.

203
00:10:19.368 --> 00:10:21.119
- You paged my mom?
- That's right.

204
00:10:21.203 --> 00:10:23.830
- Oh, man, not again!
- Mr. Mackey, can I ask you a question?

205
00:10:23.914 --> 00:10:24.956
I see, you can.

206
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:27.459
- What the fuck's the big fucking deal?
- Uh-huh.

207
00:10:27.543 --> 00:10:31.129
Answer me immediately where you heard
these horrible obscenities, okay?

208
00:10:31.213 --> 00:10:32.213
Nowhere.

209
00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:34.276
We've heard Mr. Garrison
Mr. Garrison's use of them.

210
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.925
- Aha!
- Boys, I seriously doubt it,

211
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.969
that Mr. Garrison
Mr. Garrison ever said.

212
00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:41.056
"Eat penguin shit, you asshole!"

213
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.850
Awesome!

214
00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:49.898
Thank you for arriving so quickly.

215
00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:51.483
That's not like you, Stanley!

216
00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:54.944
What did my son say, Mr. Mackey?
Did he say the "G" word?

217
00:10:55.029 --> 00:10:57.697
- No. Worse.
- The "H" word?

218
00:10:57.782 --> 00:11:01.326
Here's a short list of expressions
that they used, okay?

219
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.329
- Oh, my God.
- What the hell is an "auger"?!

220
00:11:04.413 --> 00:11:06.224
It's when you put
your legs over your head,

221
00:11:06.248 --> 00:11:08.583
and someone else is licking your ass.

222
00:11:10.127 --> 00:11:12.671
Young man! Right this second.
tell Mr. Mackey,

223
00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:14.506
where you've heard
all those horrible expressions!

224
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:15.715
Я... я...

225
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.403
We're not allowed to tell, we've taken
a terrible oath to keep it a secret.

226
00:11:18.427 --> 00:11:20.072
- From the movie with Terrence and Phillip.
- Dude!

227
00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:21.907
What? Fuck you guys!
I want to get out of here!

228
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:24.015
Terrence and Phillip?
Those Canadians?!

229
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.184
I'm sorry, what the hell are
Terrence freakin' Phillip?

230
00:11:26.268 --> 00:11:29.813
Terrance and Phillip are a couple of rather
a couple of very untalented actresses from Canada.

231
00:11:29.897 --> 00:11:32.232
It's nothing but matronly language and toilet humor.

232
00:11:32.316 --> 00:11:34.878
Well, I guess I'm gonna have to send out
a warning letter to all the parents,

233
00:11:34.902 --> 00:11:36.861
before the rest of the kids
see this movie.

234
00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:38.571
- Everybody was fucking watching!
- Eric!

235
00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:39.936
I'm sorry, there's nothing
I can't help it.

236
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.075
This movie has perverted
my fragile mind.

237
00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:51.835
♪ That's the girl ♪
♪ that I like ♪

238
00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:56.548
♪ With that new smarty-pants ♪
♪ I'm already in bed ♪

239
00:11:56.632 --> 00:11:59.384
Hey, man! You're holding up the line,
goddamn it!

240
00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:01.928
- Hey, guys!
- Hey, Chief.

241
00:12:02.012 --> 00:12:03.346
- How's it going?
- Not good.

242
00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:05.432
- Why bad?
- We got busted for swearing.

243
00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:07.994
Our moms said we're not allowed
to see a movie with Terrance and Phillip.

244
00:12:08.018 --> 00:12:09.060
That's too bad.

245
00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:10.622
You should have seen Kyle
when his mom showed up!

246
00:12:10.646 --> 00:12:11.980
He's scared out of his mind
he was scared out of his mind!

247
00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:14.167
- Shut up, Cartman!
- Nah, I'd be scared, too.

248
00:12:14.191 --> 00:12:15.271
Your mom's a fucking bitch.

249
00:12:15.317 --> 00:12:17.037
Don't call my mom a bitch,
you fat fuck!

250
00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:19.069
Don't call me fat,
you fucking asshole!

251
00:12:19.113 --> 00:12:21.614
Wow, you guys!
Where'd you learn to talk like that?

252
00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:23.241
Just fucking awesome, huh?

253
00:12:23.325 --> 00:12:26.453
Chief, how do you make a woman
to love you more than anyone else in the world?

254
00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:27.579
Well, it's a piece of cake.

255
00:12:27.663 --> 00:12:30.498
- I just need to find the clitoris.
- What?

256
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.001
What does it mean to find the clitoris?

257
00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:34.294
Forget it, I didn't say anything.

258
00:12:34.378 --> 00:12:36.463
Come on, don't hold up the line.

259
00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:38.590
You guys don't know
where to find a clitoris?

260
00:12:38.674 --> 00:12:39.716
What?

261
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.676
It's like finding Jesus, isn't it?

262
00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:42.844
May I have your attention, students!

263
00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:46.139
There is a new rule regarding
dress code in elementary school...

264
00:12:46.223 --> 00:12:49.434
Terrance and Phillip t-shirts
are off-limits.

265
00:12:49.518 --> 00:12:51.371
Everyone who's wearing a T-shirt today
with Terrance and Phillip on it,

266
00:12:51.395 --> 00:12:54.063
you should immediately
to go home.

267
00:12:54.148 --> 00:12:55.356
- Yay!
- Hooray!

268
00:12:59.236 --> 00:13:01.821
Canadian adult movie
"Flaming Assholes ...

269
00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:03.531
holds the number one spot
in ticket sales.

270
00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.617
But isn't this movie ruining
the youth of America?

271
00:13:05.701 --> 00:13:08.077
With a special report--
a midget in a bikini.

272
00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:10.580
Thank you, Tom.
Apparently, a Canadian comedy

273
00:13:10.664 --> 00:13:12.184
really does have
a far-reaching effect.

274
00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.501
It seems that children are being exposed
all over America.

275
00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:16.711
It's like the spelling bee
spelling bee in Washington.

276
00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:21.299
So, the silver medal assignment:
write "expertise."

277
00:13:21.383 --> 00:13:23.570
Fuck him! Why the fuck
write "expertise"?

278
00:13:23.594 --> 00:13:24.677
- Yeah. (chuckles)
- Right.

279
00:13:24.762 --> 00:13:28.765
Here's one for you: "S-O-S-I W-O-P-U."
Forensics!

280
00:13:29.558 --> 00:13:31.976
Tom, the devastating impact
of the Canadian duo.

281
00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:36.189
is also evident in their hit song.
"You shut the fuck up, uncle fucker."

282
00:13:36.398 --> 00:13:39.108
♪ You shut the fuck up, ♪
♪ uncle fucker! ♪

285
00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.326
- You have the floor, Tom.
- Thanks, midget.

286
00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:49.410
Shocking report.

287
00:13:49.453 --> 00:13:51.996
The controversy began
in the small town of South Park,

288
00:13:52.081 --> 00:13:54.559
where the local PTA
is trying to ban this movie.

289
00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:57.623
We're joined this evening
of the PTA, Sheila Broflovski.

290
00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.171
- Hello, Tom.
- And the Canadian Minister of Film.

291
00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:01.506
Thanks for calling me, buddy.

292
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:02.859
Mr. Secretary.
Parents are concerned

293
00:14:02.883 --> 00:14:04.884
entertainment products
from your country. Opinion?

294
00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:07.364
Actually, this movie is rated 'R',
it's not intended for children.

295
00:14:07.388 --> 00:14:09.407
But the kids, of course,
they'll still watch it!

296
00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:11.076
Let me finish!
Us Canadians,

297
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.118
I'm surprised at your outrage...

298
00:14:12.142 --> 00:14:15.019
- You don't give a damn!
- Will you let me finish? А?

299
00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:17.916
In the United States, there are violent scenes on television
on TV 24 hours a day, 7 days a week!

300
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.084
I can't believe
that because of the movie.

301
00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:20.627
with a few swear words.
you're getting so heated.

302
00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:24.320
- Because he's awful!
- Finish?! Please let me finish!

303
00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:26.406
Okay, I'm done.

304
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.366
However, Mr. Minister,
this movie.

305
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:30.387
is by no means the first trouble
to come from Canada.

306
00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:32.055
Let's not forget
about Bryan Adams.

307
00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:33.723
No, no, no! Our state
has already brought many times

308
00:14:33.747 --> 00:14:35.187
apologizing for Bryan Adams.

309
00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:36.708
You Canadians all look alike!

310
00:14:36.792 --> 00:14:38.877
You have running eyes
and twitching heads!

311
00:14:38.961 --> 00:14:41.022
- You're just trash!
- I'm outraged! That's racist!

312
00:14:41.046 --> 00:14:42.691
Our children are addicted
to your slop!

313
00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:44.382
Madam, you're a racist!
Racist!

314
00:14:44.466 --> 00:14:45.925
It's going to take us many weeks

315
00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.262
to undo the damage
your movie has done to our children!

316
00:14:52.349 --> 00:14:55.727
Kids, welcome
to rehab, okay?

317
00:14:55.811 --> 00:14:58.897
Your mothers wanted you suspended
from normal school activities.

318
00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:01.482
and put it here
so you'd stop swearing.

319
00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:03.295
I dare say,
I don't belong with these naughty boys.

320
00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:06.029
I went to Yardale
and I was a straight-A student.

321
00:15:06.113 --> 00:15:07.405
You're a fucking faggot.

322
00:15:07.489 --> 00:15:10.617
Okay, kids. This is exactly
what I'm talking about, okay?

323
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:12.911
We must rid you
from foul language.

324
00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:15.747

So, Phillip. I hope, uh,
you've learned something

376
00:17:21.832 --> 00:17:22.934
because of that experience.

377
00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:27.587
Yeah. I've learned that you're
a pussy-biting, farting motherfucker!

378
00:17:28.213 --> 00:17:30.590

the northern lights?

- Good night!

382
00:17:46.857 --> 00:17:49.210
Man, I've been rewatching so many movies,
and the movie just keeps getting better and better!

383
00:17:49.234 --> 00:17:50.860
- Hey!
- Uh-huh. But you know what?

384
00:17:50.944 --> 00:17:52.904
Lighting fart gas on fire is fucked up.

385
00:17:52.988 --> 00:17:54.614
It can't be set on fire.

386
00:17:54.698 --> 00:17:56.157
No way!

387
00:17:56.825 --> 00:18:00.661
Kenny, I'll bet you $100
you won't light the fart on fire?

388
00:18:07.002 --> 00:18:09.337
- Holy shit, man!
- Oh, my God!

389
00:18:10.172 --> 00:18:12.340
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

390
00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:16.010
- Help me! Do something!
- The stick is on fire!

391
00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:24.644
- Oh, my God! You killed Kenny!
- You bastard!

392
00:18:24.728 --> 00:18:27.230
Well, it looks like farts
can be set on fire after all.

393
00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:32.401
Pour 70ccs of sodium pentothal
70 cc's of sodium pentothol!

394

- We called the parents.
- Oh, man!

395
00:18:34.571 --> 00:18:35.757
Our moms are about to find out,

396
00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:37.217
that we went back
to a movie with Terrence and Phillip.

397
00:18:37.241 --> 00:18:38.407
Suction!

398
00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:41.077
Try to untangle
the trachea and esophagus.

399
00:18:41.161 --> 00:18:43.621
- Shit!
- You're in the wrong place!

400
00:18:46.416 --> 00:18:48.126
- Damn it, Stan!
- That's disgusting!

401
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.461
- Watch the liver!
- I'm gonna get it!

402
00:18:51.046 --> 00:18:52.565
Every minute counts!

403
00:18:52.589 --> 00:18:53.629
We're going to lose him soon!

404
00:18:53.674 --> 00:18:56.134
- Doctor, the heart's stopped!
- Get it out!

405
00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:58.469
Electroshock, quick!

406
00:19:00.013 --> 00:19:03.099
- Who's making the potatoes?
- My bad, sir-- I missed lunch.

407
00:19:03.183 --> 00:19:05.852
Ah, damn it! I'm not losing
another baby!

408
00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:08.229
You can stitch him up.
We did the best we could.

409
00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:10.356
The rest is in God's hands.

410
00:19:11.942 --> 00:19:14.735
Kenny?
Kenny, can you hear me?

411
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.904
How you feeling, son?

412
00:19:17.781 --> 00:19:20.074
Good boy.
Son, I've got some bad news...

413
00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:22.869
We accidentally transplanted you
a baked potato instead of a heart.

414
00:19:22.953 --> 00:19:25.621
You have three seconds to live.

415
00:19:25.914 --> 00:19:27.665
Oh, shit! What the fuck?!

416
00:19:27.749 --> 00:19:30.543
- Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
- Bastards!

417
00:19:30.627 --> 00:19:34.672
Damn it!
It doesn't get any easier with time!

418
00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:41.512
I bet him he wouldn't light up.
I bet him $100.

419
00:19:41.597 --> 00:19:43.074
Cartman, it's not your fault.

420
00:19:43.098 --> 00:19:45.160
I know. I'm just so fucking fucked up
that I don't have to give the money back.

421
00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:48.603
Very nice! He was
your friend, you fat fuck!

422
00:19:48.687 --> 00:19:51.856
So, boys,
have you seen that movie again?

423
00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.275
- Yeah.
- All right, Kyle, I'm done!

424
00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:57.278
You're going to be grounded for two weeks
under house arrest!

425
00:19:58.071 --> 00:20:00.615
- House arrest?!
- And you, Stan. Come on, come on.

426
00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:02.992
And you, Eric, get
three weeks of house arrest.

427

Fluff it up!

493
00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:37.039
My mom's moms went to a meeting.
and they're supposed to be watching me.

494
00:23:37.124 --> 00:23:40.418
But you're still under arrest,
so fam nuffa vefelitfya!

495
00:23:40.502 --> 00:23:43.671
- What's the question?!
- Shelly, where is the clitoris?

496
00:23:45.674 --> 00:23:48.300
All right! You guys are going to be dumbfounded.
and you're gonna keep your mouths shut,

497
00:23:48.385 --> 00:23:51.679
and I'm gonna go fluff my pants.

498
00:23:53.807 --> 00:23:54.849
Okay, we're clear.

499
00:23:56.893 --> 00:23:59.497
Our next guests are those whose movie
is number one on the world charts.

500
00:23:59.521 --> 00:24:02.189
Please give a warm welcome
Terrence and Phillip!

501
00:24:02.607 --> 00:24:03.732
Yay!

502
00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.611
- Hello, Conan!
- Hello, Brooke Shields!

503
00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:09.905
Guys, someone's claiming
that your Canadian humor.

504
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:11.907
is nothing more than a fart
juvenile jokes.

505
00:24:11.992 --> 00:24:15.911
That's not true. Take, for example,
a classic Canadian joke.

506
00:24:16.329 --> 00:24:18.873
- I'm sorry, Terrence.
- Yes, Phillip?

507
00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:21.667
Holy shit!

508
00:24:23.044 --> 00:24:25.087
- Nice going, Phillip!
- Cheers, motherfucker!

509
00:24:25.172 --> 00:24:26.964
Friends, you can't say things like that
you can't say that on TV.

510
00:24:27.048 --> 00:24:29.508
Now Terrence stinks
like my ass!

511
00:24:29.593 --> 00:24:32.428
I farted once
on the set of Blue Lagoon.

512
00:24:36.641 --> 00:24:39.226
So, you guys aren't getting a little shaky
about being in America?

513
00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:40.663
Lots of organizations here

514
00:24:40.687 --> 00:24:42.730
is seeking your arrest
for corruption of minors.

515
00:24:42.814 --> 00:24:45.232
- They'll have to find us first.
- You're right.

516
00:24:45.317 --> 00:24:46.317
It's time!

517
00:24:47.527 --> 00:24:48.569
Terrence and Phillip!

518
00:24:48.653 --> 00:24:52.198
"Mothers Against Canada is placing
you under citizen's arrest!

519
00:24:52.282 --> 00:24:53.885
- Mom?
- What the hell is going on in there?

520
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:56.160
We have a court order
for your arrest!

521
00:24:56.244 --> 00:24:57.828
Phillip, we're ambushed!

522
00:24:57.913 --> 00:24:59.497
It's for you, Conan.

523
00:24:59.581 --> 00:25:01.790
That little scrotal
the scrotum sucker fooled us!

524
00:25:01.875 --> 00:25:04.168
- Not a good man!
- Don't listen to them, Conan.

525
00:25:04.252 --> 00:25:06.837
Conan, you loved our movie!
We watched it together.

526
00:25:06.922 --> 00:25:09.965
- Remember? You laughed, didn't you?
- What have I done!

527
00:25:18.767 --> 00:25:22.770
Holy shit! Did you see that?
They arrested Terrence and Phillip!

528
00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.260
UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATION

529
00:25:27.108 --> 00:25:28.317
Like the Canadian ambassador,

530
00:25:28.401 --> 00:25:30.611
I condemn the actions
taken by America.

531
00:25:30.695 --> 00:25:32.655
to apprehend
Terrence and Phillip.

532
00:25:32.739 --> 00:25:33.799
As you know,

533
00:25:33.823 --> 00:25:36.283
Terrence and Phillip are the backbone
the entire Canadian economy.

534
00:25:36.368 --> 00:25:39.119
Without them, we are doomed to decline.

535
00:25:39.371 --> 00:25:42.373
What do you say,
Mr. American Ambassador?

536
00:25:44.626 --> 00:25:46.877
- Fuck Canada!
- Fuck you, buddy!

537
00:25:46.962 --> 00:25:48.837
Terrence and Phillip
are not going free!

538
00:25:48.922 --> 00:25:51.924
They will stand trial
for molesting America's youth!

539
00:25:52.008 --> 00:25:53.611
We have no idea
what all the fuss is about!

540
00:25:53.635 --> 00:25:55.427
This racket is about
the seizure of our citizens!

541
00:25:55.512 --> 00:25:59.390
It's a rape to censor art!
It's a rape. rape.

542
00:25:59.474 --> 00:26:00.975
What's so funny about that?!

543
00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:02.434
Uh, nothing, nothing.

544
00:26:02.519 --> 00:26:05.688
Could you explain that one more time,
what's with all the speeches?

545
00:26:05.772 --> 00:26:08.232
It's not about diplomacy!
It's about dignity!

546
00:26:08.316 --> 00:26:12.027
It's about respect!
It's a sign of understanding that humor...

547
00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:14.423
You people are fucking crazy!
Let Terrence and Phillip go,

548
00:26:14.447 --> 00:26:17.157
or will you cry
with bitter tears....

549
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:19.450
Stop it! Aa-ha-haa!
Stop it!

550
00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:32.228
Pilot to bombardier, pilot to bombardier!
We're approaching the target!

551
00:26:32.299 --> 00:26:33.632
The bombs are ready, buddy.

552
00:26:34.467 --> 00:26:37.094
Baldwin Manor.
No, that's Billy Baldwin.

553
00:26:37.178 --> 00:26:40.931
If you want Daniel Baldwin,
dial his number, dumbass!

554
00:26:41.016 --> 00:26:43.684
Alec! Do you know why
it sucks to be Baldwin?

555
00:26:43.768 --> 00:26:46.103
- I don't.
- Neither do I! Ha ha ha!

556
00:26:53.361 --> 00:26:54.945
Ha! I've been missed!

557
00:26:58.617 --> 00:27:00.743
Hello, children.
Your moms forced me

558
00:27:00.827 --> 00:27:03.120
to scrap my lesson plan
and teach according to their plan.

559
00:27:03.204 --> 00:27:05.600
How come our moms
arrested Terrence and Phillip?

560
00:27:05.624 --> 00:27:06.957
- Aha!
- That's gay

561
00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:09.043
Your moms are out of sorts.

562
00:27:09.127 --> 00:27:11.837
Maybe they're having their period
or something.

563
00:27:11.921 --> 00:27:15.132
Mr. Garrison! Wendy and I believe
that that was a sexist remark.

564
00:27:15.216 --> 00:27:16.300
Well, I'm sorry, Wendy,

565
00:27:16.384 --> 00:27:20.054
but I don't trust anything that bleeds
for five days in a row but doesn't die.

566
00:27:20.138 --> 00:27:23.307
Anyway, kids,
let's start with the dictionary.

567
00:27:23.391 --> 00:27:25.476
- Attention students. Understand?
- What else is there?

568
00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.938
Everyone gather immediately in the gymnasium
for a special announcement. Understood?

569
00:27:32.776 --> 00:27:35.361
- What's going on, Chief?
- Something big, kids.

570
00:27:35.445 --> 00:27:37.571
Chief, I can't find my clitoris.
You have to help me.

571
00:27:37.656 --> 00:27:39.031
Stan, the clitoris...

572
00:27:39.115 --> 00:27:42.785
Please take your seats,
the announcement is about to be made, okay?

573
00:27:43.203 --> 00:27:44.703
State of Emergency.

574
00:27:44.788 --> 00:27:46.557
We turn now to the White House
listen to a statement

575
00:27:46.581 --> 00:27:48.957
of the President of the United States.

576
00:27:49.042 --> 00:27:50.501
Dear Americans.

577
00:27:50.585 --> 00:27:54.755
Today, at 5:00 a.m., on a day
that will forever be covered in shame...

578
00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:58.801
the Canadians bombed the Baldwins.

579
00:27:58.885 --> 00:28:03.305
In response to this,
the United States declared war on Canada.

580
00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:07.559
- Oh, no!
- War...?

581
00:28:07.644 --> 00:28:10.688
- No, Gregory, no!
- This is bad, Wendy. Hold on.

582
00:28:10.772 --> 00:28:12.439
All the Baldwins are dead?!

583
00:28:12.524 --> 00:28:15.609
It's time to give the Canadians
a proper response.

584
00:28:15.694 --> 00:28:19.071
Within two days, war criminals
war criminals Terrence and Phillip

585
00:28:19.155 --> 00:28:20.906
will be executed.

586
00:28:21.741 --> 00:28:23.033
What, are they gonna kill them?!

587
00:28:23.118 --> 00:28:26.954
And now I'd like to give the floor
to my new Secretary of Defense,

588
00:28:27.038 --> 00:28:29.039
Ms. Sheila Broflovski.

589
00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:30.374
Holy shit, man!

590
00:28:30.458 --> 00:28:31.875
My dear fellow Americans!

591
00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:36.046
We will not tolerate any more bullying
from our neighbor to the north!

592
00:28:36.131 --> 00:28:38.257
- I have a plan...
- The Canadians want to go to war with us,

593
00:28:38.341 --> 00:28:40.884
because we're not going to
to tolerate their profanity!

594
00:28:40.969 --> 00:28:46.056
Well, if they want a war,
they're gonna get a war!

595
00:28:48.476 --> 00:28:52.354
- Man, that's fucked up.
- That's the worst.

596
00:29:03.908 --> 00:29:06.994
Oh, fallen one! I am Satan!

597
00:29:07.078 --> 00:29:09.621
I am your God from now on!

598
00:29:12.208 --> 00:29:14.168
There's no escape!

599
00:29:17.255 --> 00:29:20.174
So feel
sweet pain!

600
00:29:20.967 --> 00:29:24.011
Hey, Satan! Did you hear the news?

601
00:29:24.095 --> 00:29:26.680
A war has just broken out
a war has broken out.

602
00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:30.309
Meet Saddam Hussein. This is Saddam Hussein,
my new partner in evil!

603
00:29:30.852 --> 00:29:32.853
Make way, Satan!
You've taken all the fun!

604
00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:36.607
Aha! Aha!
This is so exciting for me!

605
00:29:37.358 --> 00:29:39.211
Saddam, please,
let me do my job?

606
00:29:39.235 --> 00:29:41.779
Go ahead and massage my nipples,
while I torture this little piggy!

607
00:29:41.863 --> 00:29:45.115
Can I talk to you for a second,
to talk?

608
00:29:46.409 --> 00:29:50.329
I don't understand why you feel the need
to humiliate me in front of people?

609
00:29:50.413 --> 00:29:51.705
Hey, man! Relax!

610
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.708
Sometimes I don't think you have
the slightest respect for me.

611
00:29:54.793 --> 00:29:56.835
Hey, man, come here.

612
00:29:57.754 --> 00:30:00.380
- Who's my custard pie?
- Я.

613
00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:02.341
That's right, baby.

614
00:30:05.804 --> 00:30:07.865
- Man, I don't want to fight anybody.
- You think they're really

615
00:30:07.889 --> 00:30:09.200
kill Terrence and Phillip?

616
00:30:09.224 --> 00:30:11.308
Kyle, will you stop
being such a pussy

617
00:30:11.392 --> 00:30:12.453
and learn to stand up to your mother!

618
00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:14.038
Punch her in the face and tell her:

619
00:30:14.062 --> 00:30:15.623
"Cut the shit, you fucking bitch!"

620
00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:17.397
Don't call my mom a bitch,
Cartman!

621
00:30:17.482 --> 00:30:19.274
Guys, come on.
This isn't helping the cause.

622
00:30:19.359 --> 00:30:20.484
This is where you have to think.

623
00:30:20.568 --> 00:30:22.880
Let's figure this out... What would Brian Boitano
Brian Boitano in our shoes?

624
00:30:22.904 --> 00:30:25.405
Yeah, what would Brian Boitano be doing?

625
00:30:28.243 --> 00:30:29.576
Hey, what's going on out there?

626
00:30:29.661 --> 00:30:32.341
America believes it has the right to be
"the world's gendarme."

627
00:30:32.413 --> 00:30:34.558
Your government is about to
to kill two Canadian citizens.

628
00:30:34.582 --> 00:30:38.168
An action already condemned by the UN.
Truly, "home of the free".

629
00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:41.505
- Play ball on a string?
- Whoa!

630
00:30:41.589 --> 00:30:44.216
It's about
freedom of speech and censorship!

631
00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.611

Ah, fuck.

678
00:32:44.545 --> 00:32:46.964
Okay, everyone, quiet, please!

679
00:32:47.048 --> 00:32:49.675
While we continue
sending troops to Canada,

680
00:32:49.759 --> 00:32:53.261
Mothers Against Canada is also waging
a war on profanity at home.

681
00:32:53.346 --> 00:32:57.182
And now Dr. Waxnocker
will demonstrate the P-chip.

682
00:33:00.311 --> 00:33:02.646
The P-chip is organized very simply.

683
00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:04.606
It's placed under the baby's skin

684
00:33:04.691 --> 00:33:06.692
and he delivers
a mild electric shock,

685
00:33:06.776 --> 00:33:08.504
when an obscenity is uttered.

686
00:33:08.528 --> 00:33:09.820
Uh, uh, just a minute.

687
00:33:09.904 --> 00:33:12.322
Does this chip somehow detect
that the child is swearing?

688
00:33:12.407 --> 00:33:13.657
It's like a lie detector.

689
00:33:13.741 --> 00:33:15.594
When you fight,
the same thing happens to you,

690
00:33:15.618 --> 00:33:16.743
how and when you lie.

691
00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:20.330
The chip responds to that, and the patient
gets a mild injection.

692
00:33:20.415 --> 00:33:23.250
Patient B-5, come over here,
please.

693
00:33:23.334 --> 00:33:26.920
Now, patient B-5
has been fitted with a new P-chip.

694
00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:28.714
- My head hurts!
- Don't worry about it.

695
00:33:28.798 --> 00:33:31.091
Now, what I want you to do
I want you to say "doggy."

696
00:33:32.343 --> 00:33:35.095
- Doggie.
- See, nothing's happening.

697
00:33:35.179 --> 00:33:38.557
- Now say "Montana."
- Montana.

698
00:33:38.641 --> 00:33:40.684
All right! Now "cushion."

699
00:33:40.768 --> 00:33:42.519
- Pillow.
- It's okay.

700
00:33:42.603 --> 00:33:45.355
And now I would like you
I want you to say: "horsefucker."

701
00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:48.483
Come on, Eric, it's okay.

702
00:33:48.568 --> 00:33:50.193
Sure...

703
00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:54.031
Ow! It hurts! Bleah-moo.
Ai-yi-yi-yi!

704
00:33:54.115 --> 00:33:57.075
Now I want you to say
"big twisty donkey dick."

705
00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.660
- I won't!
- Successful outcome!

706
00:33:58.745 --> 00:34:00.787
The kid doesn't want to fight!

707
00:34:00.872 --> 00:34:03.081
That's not fair, you sons of bitches.
Aye-aye-aye! Holy shit!

708
00:34:03.166 --> 00:34:07.419
Next week, we're going to start tagging
with P-chips on all children.

709
00:34:10.214 --> 00:34:13.592
Smack Arewich presents...
"March of War"

710
00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:15.279
Let's salute our
camouflage fighters!

711
00:34:15.303 --> 00:34:16.864
President Clinton
has called them into action,

712
00:34:16.888 --> 00:34:18.930
to fight
the evil Canadian plague!

713
00:34:19.015 --> 00:34:21.641
A full-scale raid
was unleashed on Toronto,

714
00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:23.287
in response to the latest
Canadian bombing,

715
00:34:23.311 --> 00:34:26.021
that she collected a terrible tribute
from the Arquette family.

716
00:34:26.105 --> 00:34:28.356
For the sake of greater security,
our great U.S. government

717
00:34:28.441 --> 00:34:30.878
gathers all citizens
with Canadian blood in their veins,

718
00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:32.022
and puts them in camps.

719
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:34.071
All Canadian-Americans
must arrive

720
00:34:34.155 --> 00:34:35.841
to any of the death camps
without delay.

721
00:34:35.865 --> 00:34:37.007
Did I say "death camps"?

722
00:34:37.091 --> 00:34:39.636
I mean happy camps!
You can feast on the best food,

723
00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:42.621
to be treated by renowned doctors
and regular physical exercise.

724
00:34:42.705 --> 00:34:44.664
Meanwhile, war criminals
Terrence and Phillip...

725
00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:46.625
begin preparations for the execution.

726
00:34:46.709 --> 00:34:50.295
It will take place during a spectacular
show in honor of our armed forces!

727
00:34:50.379 --> 00:34:54.257
Celebrity guests will be in attendance:
Big Gay Al and Winona Ryder!

728
00:34:54.342 --> 00:34:56.885
Of course, the only way
to get into an army show.

729
00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:58.553
is to enlist in the U.S. Army!

730
00:34:58.638 --> 00:35:01.139
Join the army,
and destroy the Canadian scum!

731
00:35:01.224 --> 00:35:04.810
And we continue the March of War!

732
00:35:04.834 --> 00:35:05.834
Eat Smack!

733
00:35:09.107 --> 00:35:12.692
We have to get rid
of all things Canadian!

734
00:35:13.444 --> 00:35:14.644
- Down with Canada!
- Let's bomb them!

735
00:35:15.029 --> 00:35:17.049
Man, don't you just love
love Terrance and Phillip anymore?

736
00:35:17.073 --> 00:35:18.240
Of course not! Mommy says,

737
00:35:18.324 --> 00:35:20.969
that now I hate Canadians,
because they've made me a curser.

738
00:35:20.993 --> 00:35:22.661
Burn everything!

739
00:35:23.329 --> 00:35:25.288
- Hey, dudes.
- What's up, Cartman?

740
00:35:25.373 --> 00:35:28.500
It's the P-chip. It's just annoying--
I can't swear anymore.

741
00:35:28.584 --> 00:35:30.961
- Oh, come on. You can't say "dick"?
- Uh, no.

742
00:35:31.045 --> 00:35:32.963
- And you can't say "shit"?
- Uh, no.

743
00:35:33.047 --> 00:35:34.483
And you're never gonna say:
"I, Eric Cartman..."

744
00:35:34.507 --> 00:35:36.026
"the world's fattest
fucking piece of shit"?

745
00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:38.301
- Fuck you!
- Oh, man, that's great!

746
00:35:38.386 --> 00:35:40.106
Anyway, guys,
this has gone too far!

747
00:35:40.138 --> 00:35:41.680
It's time to reach out to our mothers!

748
00:35:41.764 --> 00:35:43.367
We're supposed to be
under house arrest?

749
00:35:43.391 --> 00:35:45.642
Come on, Kyle, it's time to get
politically active!

750
00:35:45.726 --> 00:35:48.812
Canada will no longer
corrupting our children!

751
00:35:48.896 --> 00:35:52.274
- Mom, can I talk to you? Just for a second?
- Kyle! What are you doing here?

752
00:35:52.358 --> 00:35:53.650
You're under arrest!

753
00:35:53.734 --> 00:35:55.986
Come home now
and stay there!

754
00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:57.487
You too, Stanley!

755
00:35:57.572 --> 00:36:00.532
Mom, you've gone too far.
You can't kill Terrence and Phillip.

756
00:36:00.616 --> 00:36:02.993
We must fight
for our children's future.

757
00:36:03.077 --> 00:36:04.638
You started the war.
it's up to you to stop it!

758
00:36:04.662 --> 00:36:06.663
...to keep them safe!

759
00:36:06.747 --> 00:36:08.999
- Hello!
- Our children are precious!

760
00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:12.169
- Hello, hello!
- We have to fight back,

761
00:36:12.253 --> 00:36:14.004
stopping at nothing!

762
00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:15.732
Told you,
my mom wouldn't listen.

763
00:36:15.756 --> 00:36:18.235
Well, then it's up to us
to save Terrence and Phillip!

764
00:36:18.259 --> 00:36:19.801
- What?
- Guys, think about it.

765
00:36:19.886 --> 00:36:21.094
What would Brian Boitano do?

766
00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:22.781
He would have found a way to help out
Terrence and Phillip,

767
00:36:22.805 --> 00:36:23.847
before they're executed.

768
00:36:23.931 --> 00:36:26.571
There's nothing we can do--
our moms' organization is too strong.

769
00:36:26.642 --> 00:36:28.620
Well, then we're gonna round up
all the grounded kids in the city

770
00:36:28.644 --> 00:36:30.044
and start our own organization.

771
00:36:30.104 --> 00:36:32.082
an organization to assist
to save Terrence and Phillip!

772
00:36:32.106 --> 00:36:34.191
That's right! Our very own
secret club!

773
00:36:34.275 --> 00:36:37.027

Nothing's moving for me....

810
00:38:16.502 --> 00:38:19.421
What began as a spat
between the United States and Canada,

811
00:38:19.505 --> 00:38:21.305
is about to be transformed
into World War III.

812
00:38:21.382 --> 00:38:22.716
World War III?!

813
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.403
Terrence and Phillip
will be put to death

814
00:38:24.427 --> 00:38:25.696
for crimes
against humanity.

815
00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.053
The execution is scheduled for...

816
00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:31.433
And so it is done! Four horsemen
have been sighted in the distance!

817
00:38:31.517 --> 00:38:34.144
An ancient prophecy is coming true!

818
00:38:34.228 --> 00:38:36.123
I love it when you start
biblical, Satan!

819
00:38:36.147 --> 00:38:37.708
You know very well
how to raise my tower!

820
00:38:37.732 --> 00:38:40.859
No, I'm serious.
This is the seventh sign.

821
00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:42.902
- What?
- Behold.

822
00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:45.822
The first signs of my reign
have come true.

823
00:38:45.906 --> 00:38:48.658
The fall of an empire,
the appearance of the comet.

824
00:38:48.743 --> 00:38:53.496
And now that the blood of these Canadians
will fall on American soil,

825
00:38:53.581 --> 00:38:56.416
it will be our time to rise up!

826
00:38:57.168 --> 00:39:00.503
Yes! Yes! Shit, I'm getting aroused!
Let's fuck!

827
00:39:00.588 --> 00:39:02.130
Do you think about sex all the time?

828
00:39:02.214 --> 00:39:04.716
I'm talking about
about very important matters!

829
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.802
I just got overexcited at the thought
of taking over the world. Come on!

830
00:39:07.887 --> 00:39:10.305
Is sex the only thing
that matters to you?

831
00:39:10.389 --> 00:39:11.765
I love you.

832
00:39:13.059 --> 00:39:14.517
I want to believe that.

833
00:39:14.602 --> 00:39:18.396
So how about we turn off the lights
and get laid, huh?

834
00:39:22.443 --> 00:39:24.861
Yeah, you like it that way,
don't you, rooster?

835
00:39:27.782 --> 00:39:30.700
Okay. We're gonna use daddy's
computer to round up the guys.

836
00:39:30.785 --> 00:39:33.620
Hold on. Before we send out those messages,
do a search on the word "clitoris."

837
00:39:33.704 --> 00:39:35.038
Hmm, okay.

838
00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:38.291
There are 8 million pages
for the word "clitoris."

839
00:39:38.376 --> 00:39:39.376
Whoa!

840
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:43.004
I'll look at the first one.
"No one under the age of 18 is allowed."

841
00:39:43.089 --> 00:39:46.257
OK. "Welcome to the site of German
kinky fetish videos."

842
00:39:46.342 --> 00:39:49.177
"If you're under 18..."
Come on, OK.

843
00:39:52.181 --> 00:39:53.723
Shit! They're pooping on the lady!

844
00:39:53.808 --> 00:39:56.226
- Whoa! Isn't that Cartman's mom?
- Very funny.

845
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:58.353
That's Cartman's mom!

846
00:39:59.146 --> 00:40:00.397
Coming, sweetie.

847
00:40:00.481 --> 00:40:01.898
Ah, son of a bitch. Aah!

848
00:40:03.317 --> 00:40:04.961
Get outta here, Ike!
You're too young for this.

849
00:40:04.985 --> 00:40:05.985
Paiben.

850
00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:07.987
What's he doing now?

851
00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.697
All righty.

852
00:40:13.452 --> 00:40:14.911
Shit, turn it off!

853
00:40:14.995 --> 00:40:16.807
What a fucking people these Germans are!

854
00:40:16.831 --> 00:40:18.767
All right, all right. Let's just, uh.
do what we came here to do,

855
00:40:18.791 --> 00:40:19.991
and send a message to the kids.

856
00:40:20.042 --> 00:40:22.562
Well, let's see. I'm supposed to do
a mass e-mail.

857
00:40:22.586 --> 00:40:24.022
Fucking hell, Cartman!
I'm freaking out about your mom!

858
00:40:24.046 --> 00:40:25.273
Just go to an internet forum!

859
00:40:25.297 --> 00:40:27.110
I'm trying.
I can't find a Canadian server.

860
00:40:27.135 --> 00:40:28.699
We'll have to hack into the mainframe.

861
00:40:28.926 --> 00:40:32.595
Oh, crap, I need the access code.
I'll try to reroute the crypto-security.

862
00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.100
ACCESS OPEN

863
00:40:36.116 --> 00:40:39.227
Bingo! Let's go.
"Do you want to help Terrence and Phillip?"

864
00:40:39.251 --> 00:40:41.251
"Tonight, after
"after you've been sent to bed,"

865
00:40:41.275 --> 00:40:43.231
"sneak into Carl's warehouse."

866
00:40:43.232 --> 00:40:45.752
- Tell me it's punch and pie!
- Why, where are we gonna get them?

867
00:40:45.776 --> 00:40:48.846
More people will come if they think
we're having punch and pie!

868
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:51.197
"Punch and Pie."

869
00:40:51.198 --> 00:40:54.492
"Top secret!
Password..."

870
00:40:54.994 --> 00:40:56.703
"Resistance."

871
00:40:57.538 --> 00:40:59.456
So, the draft starts tomorrow,

872
00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:02.584
as more and more manpower is needed
to invade Canada.

873
00:41:02.668 --> 00:41:04.688
The Canadian government is pleading
for a peaceful resolution,

874
00:41:04.712 --> 00:41:07.255
but we, of course,
we don't listen to him.

875
00:41:07.506 --> 00:41:08.590
Good night, sweetie.

876
00:41:08.674 --> 00:41:10.967
Mom, when will the war end?

877
00:41:11.051 --> 00:41:13.344
I don't know, sweetie.
Let's hope it's soon.

878
00:41:13.429 --> 00:41:15.763
You want it
to end sooner, huh?

879
00:41:17.641 --> 00:41:19.601
- Mom.
- Yes, sweetie?

880
00:41:19.685 --> 00:41:23.646
If you were in a German porn movie,
you would have told me about it, right?

881
00:41:24.857 --> 00:41:26.774
Sure, sweetie.
Good night!

882
00:41:36.827 --> 00:41:37.827
Poltergeist!

883
00:41:39.497 --> 00:41:41.331
Kenny, is that you?

884
00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:45.502
Satan?
Is Satan coming here?

885
00:41:46.253 --> 00:41:49.380
Saddam Hussein?
Kenny, this doesn't make any sense!

886
00:41:51.967 --> 00:41:54.677
- Eric, Eric! What is it?
- I saw him! I saw Kenny!

887
00:41:54.762 --> 00:41:58.014
Oh, you poor thing.
You've been through so much!

888
00:41:58.098 --> 00:42:01.392
I bet you couldn't light a fart on fire,
and he went in my asshole! Ouch!

889
00:42:01.477 --> 00:42:03.019
I'm not allowed to say "asshole"...?

890
00:42:05.105 --> 00:42:07.565
The execution of Terrence and Phillip
is imminent.

891
00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:10.443
Soon Saddam and I
will rule the world!

892
00:42:12.446 --> 00:42:15.448
Hey, Satan! I've got more baggage
for the trip up to Earth!

893
00:42:15.533 --> 00:42:16.676
Let's fuck in honor of that!

894
00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:19.869
Saddam, how's it going up there on Earth?
Tell me about it again.

895
00:42:19.954 --> 00:42:21.996
Hey, stop talking!
Get to the point, get to the point!

896
00:42:22.081 --> 00:42:23.873
At first, when you
when you first got here,

897
00:42:23.958 --> 00:42:27.043
we talked all night long,
until the sun came up.

898
00:42:27.127 --> 00:42:29.796
Just talking,
lying in bed.

899
00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:32.567
Right. Because I've been waiting
to get in bed with you, dumbass!

900
00:42:32.591 --> 00:42:35.051
How come you always
always want to fuck me from behind?

901
00:42:35.135 --> 00:42:37.845
Isn't it because you're imagining
someone else in my shoes?

902
00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:40.473
Satan, you have
a giant red ass.

903
00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:43.601
Who else am I supposed to think you are?
Liza Minnelli?

904
00:42:45.479 --> 00:42:47.313

CARL'S STORE.

934
00:44:56.443 --> 00:44:58.421
- Cartman, you're late!
- I had to ride my bike.

935
00:44:58.445 --> 00:45:00.613
- My buttocks hurt like hell.
- "Glutes"?

936
00:45:00.698 --> 00:45:01.821
I had to say "buttocks."

937
00:45:01.846 --> 00:45:03.890
because I'm gonna get fucked up
if I say "asshole"!

938
00:45:03.951 --> 00:45:07.537
- Did you bring punch and pie?
- No. Guys, something's come up.

939
00:45:07.621 --> 00:45:09.872
- I don't think Kenny's dead.
- What?

940
00:45:09.957 --> 00:45:11.037
I saw him in my room.

941
00:45:11.083 --> 00:45:13.376
I know, Cartman, I know.
I see Kenny every day.

942
00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:16.045
- Really?
- It's true. In every child's smile.

943
00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:18.214
In the face of every little one.

944
00:45:18.298 --> 00:45:20.174
Hey! I'm telling you,
it was Kenny himself!

945
00:45:20.259 --> 00:45:22.028
He said that if
Terrence and Phillip died,

946
00:45:22.052 --> 00:45:25.304
Saddam Hussein and Satan will come out
to Earth and take over the world!

947
00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:26.931
Saddam Hussein?!

948
00:45:31.979 --> 00:45:34.564
- Who's there?
- I am here in the name of the Resistance.

949
00:45:34.648 --> 00:45:37.191
- Password?
- Uh-oh. Uh, I don't know.

950
00:45:37.276 --> 00:45:39.819
- Guess!
- Uh. "Bacon?

951
00:45:40.654 --> 00:45:41.988
Okay.

952
00:45:45.826 --> 00:45:47.034
Oh, no. It's that kid!

953
00:45:47.119 --> 00:45:49.412
- This is the place.
- Wendy?

954
00:45:49.496 --> 00:45:51.914
Stan? Did you start
of the Resistance?

955
00:45:52.666 --> 00:45:54.826
You're more politically active
than we thought.

956
00:45:54.877 --> 00:45:57.158
Let's get this meeting started.
The others are on their way.

957
00:46:00.424 --> 00:46:02.759
Wow, that's quite a turnout.

958
00:46:04.428 --> 00:46:05.595
Uh, well, uh, long story short.

959
00:46:05.679 --> 00:46:07.680
Terrence and Phillip
are sentenced to death.

960
00:46:07.765 --> 00:46:09.891
And we think it sucks!

961
00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:12.810
So...?

962
00:46:12.895 --> 00:46:15.438
Uh, we figured,
there's supposed to be punch and pie?

963
00:46:15.522 --> 00:46:17.148
There's neither.

964
00:46:21.153 --> 00:46:23.029
Terrence and Phillip
are sentenced to death,

965
00:46:23.113 --> 00:46:25.364
and that's why we're offering
to make a bunch of calls,

966
00:46:25.449 --> 00:46:28.785
to make a pizza delivery
to unsuspecting police officers!

967
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:34.290
- May I?
- What?

968
00:46:34.875 --> 00:46:36.186
Terrence and Phillip
at this point

969
00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:38.480
are being held in a camp for Canadians
2 kilometers outside of town.

970
00:46:38.504 --> 00:46:41.464
They'll be executed tomorrow, during a show
in honor of the armed forces.

971
00:46:41.548 --> 00:46:42.590
Tomorrow?

972
00:46:42.674 --> 00:46:44.360
When the show starts,
we'll have exactly one hour,

973
00:46:44.384 --> 00:46:45.862
to get Terrence and Phillip
to get Terrence and Phillip out of the cell.

974
00:46:45.886 --> 00:46:46.928
and deliver it here.

975
00:46:47.012 --> 00:46:48.531
This is where we all meet,
and together.

976
00:46:48.555 --> 00:46:50.366
we're gonna get Terrence and Phillip
Terrence and Phillip to Canada.

977
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:52.225
Holy crap!
Wendy's new boyfriend is smart.

978
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:54.989
Meet at the assembly point
at 8:00 p.m. sharp.

979
00:46:55.062 --> 00:46:56.998
To get in and get Terrence and Phillip
Terrence and Phillip--

980
00:46:57.022 --> 00:47:00.316
the most dangerous part, so, uh.
I'm gonna handle this one personally.

981
00:47:00.567 --> 00:47:02.235
No way! We'll take care of it!

982
00:47:02.736 --> 00:47:03.820
We founded the Resistance.

983
00:47:03.904 --> 00:47:06.216
We'll pick up Terrance and Phillip.
and meet everyone at the rendezvous point.

984
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.950
It's, uh. it would be very dangerous.
Are you sure about this?

985
00:47:09.034 --> 00:47:10.159
We don't give a fuck!

986
00:47:10.244 --> 00:47:11.888
Cartman, do you want
to carry the P-Chip around forever?

987
00:47:11.912 --> 00:47:14.872
Here we go! Now, let's, uh.
run through our plan.

988
00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:26.759
Oh, shit! Ned, this is hostilities!

989
00:47:26.844 --> 00:47:29.637
Fucking Aussies!

990
00:47:29.721 --> 00:47:31.764
I think we're at war with the Canadians.

991
00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:34.016
Canadians, Australians,
whatever!

992
00:47:34.101 --> 00:47:38.563
This uniform makes me feel like a tough.
brutal man, Mr. Hat.

993
00:47:38.647 --> 00:47:40.648
It is, Mr. Garrison.

994
00:47:40.732 --> 00:47:42.900
Oh, man. I can't wait for our
first furlough,

995
00:47:42.985 --> 00:47:46.070
to get some fresh pussy!

996
00:47:46.154 --> 00:47:47.154
Attention!

997
00:47:47.239 --> 00:47:50.491
For you, fighters,
there's a show tomorrow night!

998
00:47:50.576 --> 00:47:55.288
There will be a variety of celebrities in attendance,
and then the execution of Terrence and Phillip!

999
00:47:55.789 --> 00:48:00.084
After the show, we're finally going to start
to send ground troops to Canada!

1000
00:48:00.168 --> 00:48:01.460
So let's strategize!

1001
00:48:01.545 --> 00:48:02.795
The map!

1002
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:05.715
Our sources
have reported that the Canadians

1003
00:48:05.799 --> 00:48:08.676
are preparing for our invasion,
so we'll take precautions.

1004
00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.197
Each battalion will have a specific
code name and mission.

1005
00:48:11.221 --> 00:48:13.639
5th Battalion, raise your hands!

1006
00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:16.058
You will be the most important
first wave

1007
00:48:16.143 --> 00:48:18.895
under the name
Operation Human Shield!

1008
00:48:18.979 --> 00:48:20.062
Hey, wait a minute!

1009
00:48:20.147 --> 00:48:23.274
During Operation Human Shield.
there will be heavy casualties.

1010
00:48:23.358 --> 00:48:24.859
14th Battalion!

1011
00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:28.237
Order. Your operation is called
"Frame the nigger."

1012
00:48:28.322 --> 00:48:30.072
You will follow the 5th Battalion.

1013
00:48:30.157 --> 00:48:33.910
And for God's sake, try not to die!
Any questions, boys?

1014
00:48:33.994 --> 00:48:34.994
Yes, soldier?

1015
00:48:35.078 --> 00:48:37.705
Have you ever heard
of the Declaration of the Abolition of Slavery?

1016
00:48:37.789 --> 00:48:39.373
I don't listen to hip-hop.

1017
00:48:39.458 --> 00:48:43.544
So, after this, we're going to march
all the way to the heart of Canada. And we'll, uh.

1018
00:48:43.629 --> 00:48:45.463
I'll get you!
I'll get you!

1019
00:48:45.547 --> 00:48:47.840
What the fuck?

1020
00:48:48.258 --> 00:48:51.594
Fucking Windows 98!
And get Bill Gates in here!

1021
00:48:54.848 --> 00:48:57.600
You told us that Windows 98
would be faster, more efficient.

1022
00:48:57.684 --> 00:48:59.101
and with better internet access!

1023
00:48:59.186 --> 00:49:01.771
She is faster.
Over five million...

1024
00:49:02.481 --> 00:49:04.436
All right, men!
Get a good night's rest

1025
00:49:04.461 --> 00:49:06.716
and prepare to do battle
with the Canadian scum!

1026
00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:12.592
When you get Terrence and Phillip out,
sneak in here.

1027
00:49:12.616 --> 00:49:14.761
We'll be there, but we won't be able
we won't be able to wait for you.

1028
00:49:14.785 --> 00:49:16.679
If you're not here by 10:00 p.m.,
we're gonna have to leave.

1029
00:49:16.703 --> 00:49:18.037
- I get it.
- You're brave.

1030
00:49:18.121 --> 00:49:20.642
but you're gonna need the help of someone
who's done this kind of thing before.

1031
00:49:20.666 --> 00:49:23.167
- Here's Mole's address.
- The Mole?

1032
00:49:23.251 --> 00:49:25.628
He's an expert in covert operations.

1033
00:49:25.712 --> 00:49:28.506
Your first task is to hire him.
Get a good night's sleep.

1034
00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:32.093

1074
00:51:32.547 --> 00:51:33.964
This is a very interesting book.

1075
00:51:34.049 --> 00:51:36.486
It tells us
about forms of human communication.

1076
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:39.762
Let's say that I'm communicating so that you can
to ask me questions, and you, uh.

1077
00:51:39.846 --> 00:51:42.556
Hey, this is interesting!
Let's fuck!

1078
00:51:42.641 --> 00:51:45.643
Saddam, I'm trying to make
a nice conversation with you!

1079
00:51:45.727 --> 00:51:47.353
Hey, Satan!

1080
00:51:47.896 --> 00:51:50.022
Listen to me,
this is not good enough!

1081
00:51:50.107 --> 00:51:53.067
Forget it! I'm just fucking with your head.
it's not real!

1082
00:51:53.151 --> 00:51:56.362
- Still no good.
- Hey, Satan.

1083

Ha ha, that's not real either!
Come on, man!

1084

Ha ha! Soon I'll have
the whole world will belong to me!

1085
00:52:11.545 --> 00:52:14.922
It's because of Saddam.
He doesn't care about my feelings.

1086
00:52:15.006 --> 00:52:18.175
He just wants sex,
and it's like he doesn't want to communicate.

1087
00:52:19.845 --> 00:52:22.513
You're right. I should dump him.
I'll just tell him:

1088
00:52:22.597 --> 00:52:25.307
"Sadam, I'm going to Earth,
"to rule it alone!"

1089

you'll be sent to a concentration camp
for Canadians.

1096

Don't worry, Ike.
We're gonna stop this.

1097
00:52:48.748 --> 00:52:52.835
And then I'm gonna bring my mom home,
and we'll be a family again.

1098

Holosho at home.

1099
00:53:12.898 --> 00:53:16.692
- Hello. (chuckles)
- Uh, hi. We're looking for the Mole.

1100
00:53:16.776 --> 00:53:20.487
Pardon me, but the Mole is under house arrest,
and he's not allowed to play.

1101
00:53:20.572 --> 00:53:21.655
- What?!
- The mole is a baby?

1102
00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.366
He said some very
nasty things about God.

1103
00:53:24.451 --> 00:53:26.846
Can we talk to him
just for five seconds? Please?

1104
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:29.205
All right. Kristoff!

1105
00:53:31.499 --> 00:53:33.751
Hi. We're going to
to rescue Terrence and Phillip

1106
00:53:33.835 --> 00:53:35.377
from the Army show, and we, uh.

1107
00:53:35.462 --> 00:53:37.148
- Shh! Who are you and who are you from?
- Gregory.

1108
00:53:37.172 --> 00:53:38.441
He said you could
to get us in there.

1109
00:53:38.465 --> 00:53:41.008
You're telling me you intend
to break into the Army show,

1110
00:53:41.092 --> 00:53:44.428
where there's gonna be thousands of soldiers
and get Terrence and Phillip out?

1111
00:53:44.512 --> 00:53:46.263
I, too, have decided
it was a stupid idea.

1112
00:53:46.348 --> 00:53:47.389
We are the Resistance.

1113
00:53:47.474 --> 00:53:50.077
We want to save Terrence and Phillip,
and stop the war and everything.

1114
00:53:50.101 --> 00:53:53.187
I can't help you. I'm grounded for three more days.
I'm under house arrest.

1115
00:53:53.271 --> 00:53:55.374
So do we! Our parents think
we're sitting at home right now.

1116
00:53:55.398 --> 00:53:56.398
What were you arrested for?

1117
00:53:56.483 --> 00:53:58.734
For what? Because God
hates me, that's why!

1118
00:53:58.818 --> 00:54:00.361
He ruined my life.

1119
00:54:00.445 --> 00:54:03.072
So I called him
a fucking cocksucker and got punished.

1120
00:54:03.156 --> 00:54:05.074
- So you'll help us?
- That's great.

1121
00:54:05.158 --> 00:54:07.117
Meet me in the backyard
in five minutes.

1122
00:54:08.328 --> 00:54:10.306
We're gonna show God
that we won't fucking stand for it anymore.

1123
00:54:10.330 --> 00:54:13.457
- What?! Kristoff, come here!
- I'm coming, Mom.

1124
00:54:14.626 --> 00:54:17.127
I have to be strong.
I have to be strong.

1125
00:54:18.171 --> 00:54:20.297
Saddam, I need
to talk to you.

1126
00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:21.639
Hey, pack your bags, bitch!

1127
00:54:21.675 --> 00:54:24.093
We gotta go, we're late!

1128
00:54:24.177 --> 00:54:27.388
Saddam... It happens that you love someone
you love someone very much.

1129
00:54:27.472 --> 00:54:29.306
but you still realize
he's not right for you.

1130
00:54:29.391 --> 00:54:31.100
What the fuck are you talking about?

1131
00:54:31.184 --> 00:54:33.769
You treat me
like shit! I'm leaving you.

1132
00:54:33.853 --> 00:54:36.480
And I'm going to Earth
to rule there alone.

1133
00:54:36.773 --> 00:54:38.565
No, no, you can't
do that!

1134
00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:42.528
- I'm sorry, but I have to be strong.
- Satan, please give me one chance!

1135
00:54:42.612 --> 00:54:45.739
- I have to get to Earth!
- But you don't respect me one bit!

1136
00:54:45.824 --> 00:54:48.909
Of course I do, buddy!

- All right.
- All right!

1161
00:56:18.083 --> 00:56:21.335
- Come on, we gotta hurry.
- I love you!

1162
00:56:25.173 --> 00:56:27.591
Ladies and gentlemen
of the U.S. Army!

1163
00:56:27.675 --> 00:56:30.302
Welcome to the show
in honor of the armed forces!

1164
00:56:30.804 --> 00:56:34.098
You're in for a whole lot of fun,
amazing celebrities,

1165
00:56:34.182 --> 00:56:38.060
and then the execution of Terrence and Phillip
the execution of Terrence and Phillip!

1166
00:56:43.066 --> 00:56:45.234
Here it is. The Army show,
where those military bitches

1167
00:56:45.318 --> 00:56:46.754
intend to kill Terrence and Phillip.

1168
00:56:46.778 --> 00:56:48.570
- Oh, my God!
- God?

1169
00:56:48.655 --> 00:56:50.364
He's the biggest bitch in the world!

1170
00:56:50.448 --> 00:56:54.201
We have to hurry. The meeting with the rest
with the rest of the guys at 10:00 p.m.

1171
00:56:54.661 --> 00:56:56.764
Do you realize that for this.
we could make two,

1172
00:56:56.788 --> 00:56:58.163
or even three weeks
of house arrest?

1173
00:56:58.164 --> 00:57:00.541
- We're knowingly taking this risk.
- Then let's go!

1174
00:57:00.625 --> 00:57:03.001
And here are our presenters for today:

1175
00:57:03.086 --> 00:57:06.338
Sheila Broflovski
and Big Gay Al!

1176
00:57:09.008 --> 00:57:12.177
Al, this is a very special night.
And you know why?

1177
00:57:12.262 --> 00:57:14.638
Oooh... a sale at Merv?

1178
00:57:15.014 --> 00:57:18.434
No. Because we're going
to deal with the Canadian plague.

1179
00:57:18.518 --> 00:57:21.603
That's right, Sheila!
Bring in the condemned!

1180
00:57:25.817 --> 00:57:28.986
Today is a great day for democracy!

1181
00:57:31.197 --> 00:57:33.217
Oh, Phillip! This is worse
than the night I fell asleep,

1182
00:57:33.241 --> 00:57:35.325
and you put your dick in my mouth.
and took a picture.

1183
00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:36.952
I know, Terrence. I know you do.

1184
00:57:37.036 --> 00:57:39.621
Well, Sheila.
while you're getting settled in,

1185
00:57:39.706 --> 00:57:44.126
let's announce the first act...
Yippee, doggy acrobat!

1186
00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:54.330
82ND AIRBORNE
LOVES YEPPIE!

1187
00:57:56.556 --> 00:57:59.057
Careful not to hit the wire!

1188
00:57:59.684 --> 00:58:01.226
Ah! Fucking hell.

1189
00:58:01.519 --> 00:58:02.728
Ow, fuck...!

1190
00:58:08.401 --> 00:58:11.904
Shit. The army show
has already started, and we're running out of time.

1191
00:58:11.988 --> 00:58:13.322
You see Terrence and Phillip?

1192
00:58:13.406 --> 00:58:14.823
Yeah, but they're under heavy security.

1193
00:58:15.992 --> 00:58:17.928
We have to dig our way out of here
so we don't get spotted.

1194
00:58:17.952 --> 00:58:19.036
Get to work, bitches!

1195
00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:22.873
Hey, Mole. Do you have any idea
where the clitoris is?

1196
00:58:22.957 --> 00:58:24.082
- What's what?
- The clitoris.

1197
00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:26.770
I have to find the clitoris
so Wendy's girl will like me again.

1198
00:58:26.794 --> 00:58:28.504
You gotta stop thinking with your dick!

1199
00:58:28.588 --> 00:58:29.668
We have to be on guard now!

1200
00:58:29.714 --> 00:58:31.233
Because I'm not going back
under house arrest again!

1201
00:58:31.257 --> 00:58:32.925
Not for you, not for anyone else!

1202
00:58:33.343 --> 00:58:36.178
Men! When you
find yourselves on the battlefield,

1203
00:58:36.262 --> 00:58:38.680
and you'll be looking straight ahead
into the Canadian's tiny little eyes,

1204
00:58:38.765 --> 00:58:41.725
that he swung a hockey stick.
or whatever they're armed with,

1205
00:58:41.809 --> 00:58:43.894
and people will be dying all around us.

1206
00:58:43.978 --> 00:58:46.538
remember what the American
Motion Picture Association.

1207
00:58:46.564 --> 00:58:49.358
"A movie can show
the most disgusting violence..."

1208
00:58:49.442 --> 00:58:52.194
"but only if the characters
the characters don't swear!"

1209
00:58:52.278 --> 00:58:55.113
That's what this war is about!

1210
00:58:56.741 --> 00:58:57.824
What?!

1211
00:59:00.078 --> 00:59:01.203
Shit.

1212
00:59:03.248 --> 00:59:04.706
Come on! Come on!

1213
00:59:05.959 --> 00:59:09.461
Okay, this is where we split up.
Let's synchronize our watches!

1214
00:59:09.879 --> 00:59:11.774
- We don't have a watch...
- No watch?

1215
00:59:11.798 --> 00:59:12.942
You didn't say anything about a watch!

1216
00:59:12.966 --> 00:59:14.151
Kid, what do you think this is?

1217
00:59:14.175 --> 00:59:15.611
A kids' show where everyone
sits in a circle

1218
00:59:15.635 --> 00:59:17.678
and licking the pussy of Barney the fucking
Barney the dinosaur, huh?

1219
00:59:17.762 --> 00:59:19.823
This is real life, and the consequences
will be with you to the grave!

1220
00:59:19.847 --> 00:59:22.641
- Shit, we don't have a watch!
- Fuck! Did you at least bring a mirror?

1221
00:59:22.725 --> 00:59:23.725
- That's right.
- And the rope?

1222
00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:25.435
- Bingo.
- Did you get Popato?

1223
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:28.230
- What's a "popato"?
- You need a butt to take a shit.

1224
00:59:30.233 --> 00:59:32.433
Now listen carefully.
I'm going to dig under the stage,

1225
00:59:32.485 --> 00:59:34.004
but because of the rocky ground.
it's gonna take me a while.

1226
00:59:34.028 --> 00:59:36.789
Stan and Kyle, stay at the stage,
and stop the show at all costs,

1227
00:59:36.823 --> 00:59:38.217
to keep it going until then,

1228
00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:39.950
- until I get to the prisoners.
- Okay.

1229
00:59:40.034 --> 00:59:41.952
Cartman,
there's an electrical panel over there.

1230
00:59:42.036 --> 00:59:43.514
Sneak in and de-energize him

1231
00:59:43.538 --> 00:59:44.974
before I get back
with Terrence and Phillip.

1232
00:59:44.998 --> 00:59:47.499
Otherwise, the alarms will go off
and the dogs will attack me.

1233
00:59:47.584 --> 00:59:48.834
- You got it?
- Okay.

1234
00:59:48.918 --> 00:59:51.378
Make sure you turn off the alarm!
I fucking hate dogs!

1235
00:59:51.462 --> 00:59:53.922
I heard you the first time,
you British asshole! Ouch!

1236
00:59:54.007 --> 00:59:56.758
If anything goes wrong,
make the sound of a dying giraffe.

1237
00:59:56.843 --> 00:59:59.303
What does a dying giraffe scream?

1238
01:00:02.223 --> 01:00:03.515
- Okay.
- Let's go!

1239
01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.183
- Dude, be careful.
- "Careful"?

1240
01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:07.477
Was my mother careful
stabbing me in the heart

1241
01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:10.856
a coat rack,
while I was still in the womb?

1242
01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:16.445
Man, that kid's fucking crazy.

1243
01:00:16.529 --> 01:00:20.324
- Sheila, how are the chairs coming?
- Ready in a minute, Al!

1244
01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:22.409
Great! Meanwhile...

1245
01:00:22.493 --> 01:00:26.047
you're looking at our inchworm, fairy.
and the cutie of the independent movie scene.

1246
01:00:26.072 --> 01:00:28.189
Winona Ryder!

1247
01:00:28.374 --> 01:00:29.708
Hey, guys!

1248
01:00:30.209 --> 01:00:32.336
I'm just freaking out
that I'm here!

1249
01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:35.714
What you're doing for our
for our country is so cool!

1250
01:00:36.257 --> 01:00:40.427
It's, like, war, right? Whoa!
Like, war. You know?

1251
01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:42.137
Whoa-oa-oa!

1252
01:00:42.221 --> 01:00:46.933
Okay! And now, for your enjoyment,
my tennis ball trick!

1253
01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:56.568
Holy shit!

1254
01:00:57.362 --> 01:01:01.448
"Cut the power, Cartman.
This is very important, Cartman."

1255
01:01:01.532 --> 01:01:03.385
Man, did you hear
what Winona Ryder's doing?

1256
01:01:03.409 --> 01:01:05.202
You can't miss it!

1257
01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:10.582
I didn't miss once!

1258
01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:12.959
That was my trick
with the tennis balls!

1259
01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:19.508
So that was all
performances for the day,

1260
01:01:19.592 --> 01:01:22.302
and now let's move on to the execution!

1261
01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:25.681
- Oh, no. We have to slow him down!
- More! More!

1262
01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:27.224
Yes, one more thing!

1263
01:01:27.308 --> 01:01:30.185
You fools!
Do you want to look at me again?

1264
01:01:30.269 --> 01:01:32.521
Yes! Al-homosexual! Al-homosexual!

1265
01:01:32.605 --> 01:01:34.648
- Al-homosexual!
- Al-homosexual!

1266
01:01:34.732 --> 01:01:38.193
All right! Uh, actually,
I wrote a song about the war,

1267
01:01:38.277 --> 01:01:40.028
but we haven't rehearsed it yet.

1268
01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:42.114
- Sing!
- Yeah, sing!

1269
01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:45.033
- Oh, no, I can't.
- Sing, motherfucker!

1270
01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:47.869
All right, since you insist,
I'll sing my song.

1271
01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:50.414

01:03:28.012 --> 01:03:29.888
Who's who, dick in a coat!
Fuck!

1300
01:03:30.681 --> 01:03:32.265
Are they coming?

1301
01:03:32.892 --> 01:03:35.310
But our moms
won't listen to us!

1302
01:03:40.858 --> 01:03:43.109
Okay, great!
Now, I'd like

1303
01:03:43.194 --> 01:03:46.404
to take a moment
to our wonderful sponsors.

1304
01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:47.656
He almost got to them.

1305
01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:48.842
Shh! We're saving you.

1306
01:03:48.866 --> 01:03:50.761
After I release you,
follow me through the tunnel.

1307
01:03:50.785 --> 01:03:52.179
- Hey, guys, for real.
- What, Cartman?

1308
01:03:52.203 --> 01:03:53.495
Kenny! I saw Kenny again!

1309
01:03:53.579 --> 01:03:56.081
Cartman,
did you disable the alarm?

1310
01:03:56.749 --> 01:03:57.999
Cartman?

1311
01:03:58.417 --> 01:03:59.709
Oh, shit!

1312
01:04:01.454 --> 01:04:02.330
Hey, did you hear that?

1313
01:04:02.355 --> 01:04:04.005
Looks like a giraffe is dying in there.

1314
01:04:05.591 --> 01:04:07.175
- Aah! Shit!
- Spy!

1315
01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.510
Get him!

1316
01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:11.012
Ow, fuck! Oh, fuck!

1317
01:04:12.139 --> 01:04:13.348
Oh, no...

1318
01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.351
Come on, Mole! Come on!

1319
01:04:16.435 --> 01:04:19.437
Fuck! Fuck!
Fucking guard dogs! Fuck!

1320
01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:21.398
The alarm went off!

1321
01:04:21.482 --> 01:04:23.441
Yeah, I screwed up. I'm sorry.

1322
01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:25.902
Hold me.
I'm so cold.

1323
01:04:25.987 --> 01:04:27.923
There's nothing to hope for.
Get out of here.

1324
01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:30.133
- We can't leave without you!
- Don't. It's over for me.

1325
01:04:30.157 --> 01:04:32.636
No, we can't do that!
We don't know where the fuck we are!

1326
01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:34.870
Where's your God gone
when you need him, huh?

1327
01:04:34.954 --> 01:04:38.290
Where's your beautiful,
gracious faggot?

1328
01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:41.334

against your mother! Be brave.

01:05:38.726 --> 01:05:41.728
Gentlemen,
do you have any last words?

1350
01:05:41.812 --> 01:05:44.064
Any last words? Let's see.
How do you say...

1351
01:05:44.148 --> 01:05:46.775
"Get me the fuck off this chair!"
Will that get you the last word?

1352
01:05:46.859 --> 01:05:49.653
Okay, anonymous.
Lever at the ready!

1353
01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:52.697
- Wait!
- Stanley!

1354
01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:54.366
- Eric!
- Kyle!

1355
01:05:55.534 --> 01:05:58.203
- Go ahead and fucking tell her.
- Я... I can't.

1356
01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:00.223
Terrence and Phillip can't be killed!

1357
01:06:00.247 --> 01:06:04.709
If they die, Satan and Saddam Hussein
will come and take over the world!

1358
01:06:08.589 --> 01:06:10.715
Mr. Garrison, pull the lever!

1359
01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:13.343
Hey! I'm supposed to be anonymous!

1360
01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:16.304
Goodbye, you bastards!

1361
01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:17.555
Noooo!

1362
01:06:24.897 --> 01:06:28.149
The Canadians are attacking!
Run for your lives!

1363
01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:31.361
Let's go!
We've got to cut the power!

1364
01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:33.071
Fuck!

1365
01:06:34.907 --> 01:06:37.409
Hey, we were saved by some
fat kid!

1366
01:06:42.915 --> 01:06:44.035
Terrence and Phillip, wait!

1367
01:06:44.083 --> 01:06:46.918
We need to get you
to the rendezvous point!

1368
01:06:49.922 --> 01:06:51.297
Ned, behind you!

1369
01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:12.402
Fear not...

1370
01:07:12.486 --> 01:07:13.570
Oh, my God!

1371
01:07:13.654 --> 01:07:17.157
- Behold my splendor!
- Who are you?

1372
01:07:17.241 --> 01:07:18.992
I'm a clitoris!

1373
01:07:19.326 --> 01:07:21.911
Clitoris...? I did it!
I found the clitoris!

1374
01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:24.914
Stan! It is your responsibility to prevent
the spilling of blood

1375
01:07:24.999 --> 01:07:26.541
Terrence and Phillip on the ground!

1376
01:07:26.625 --> 01:07:28.603
Hold on. You're not gonna tell me
how I can get Wendy to like me?

1377
01:07:28.627 --> 01:07:30.712
There are other things
more important things.

1378
01:07:30.796 --> 01:07:32.505
No fucking way!
I've been looking all over for you,

1379
01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:34.568
so I'm gonna have to tell you
how to get Wendy to like me!

1380
01:07:34.592 --> 01:07:37.343
Boy, you just
you just need confidence.

1381
01:07:37.428 --> 01:07:40.013
Believe in yourself.
and others will.

1382
01:07:40.097 --> 01:07:43.058
Chicks love confidence.
Now go, hurry up!

1383
01:07:43.142 --> 01:07:44.642
The clitoris has spoken.

1384
01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:47.228
Stan! Stan, what's wrong with you?

1385
01:07:47.313 --> 01:07:48.688
I see you've failed your mission.

1386
01:07:48.773 --> 01:07:51.900
You shouldn't have sent the boy
to do a man's work!

1387
01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:55.653
Let's all go together!
We're running out of time.

1388
01:07:58.532 --> 01:08:00.825
Die, Canadian! Understand?

1389
01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:07.749
- Terrence, did you hear that? I farted!
- You farted? You just did?

1390
01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:09.959
Terrence and Phillip!

1391
01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:11.836
We have to get them
to the rendezvous point!

1392
01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.755
It's Mr. Garrison!

1393
01:08:13.839 --> 01:08:16.466
Guys, take
Mr. Hat.

1394
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:18.760
Get him out of here.
please.

1395
01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:23.014
Holy shit! Man, that P-chip
is starting to work out of my ass!

1396
01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:25.016
Take cover in the trench!

1397
01:08:25.101 --> 01:08:27.393
"Human Shield, forward march!

1398
01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:29.479
Then it's Operation
"Frame the nigger"!

1399
01:08:29.563 --> 01:08:33.483
"Human shields", don't forget to also
to cover our tanks and planes!

1400
01:08:37.530 --> 01:08:39.114
Holy mother of Jehoshaphat!

1401
01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:40.198
Fire on my command!

1402
01:08:40.241 --> 01:08:42.992
Battalion,
listen to my command.

1403
01:08:43.744 --> 01:08:46.287
One, two...

1404
01:08:46.372 --> 01:08:48.248
Somebody's gonna have to die?

1405
01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:49.874
- Fire!
- ...three!

1406
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:51.918
What the fuck?!

1407
01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:56.214
- Good plan, Chief!
- Now that's one hell of a human shield!

1408
01:08:58.717 --> 01:09:01.136
Oh, my God. That's terrible.

1409
01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.929
This is what we wanted!

1410
01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:07.308
We wanted our children to grow up in an environment,
free of obscenity!

1411
01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:09.602
But we didn't want this!

1412
01:09:09.687 --> 01:09:11.479
Where are you going?

1413
01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:13.273
We're going to find our boys!

1414
01:09:13.357 --> 01:09:16.818
For God's sake, Sheila, they'll be killed!

1415
01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:25.410
Kyle, all this time I've been saying
you're a big, dumb Jew.

1416
01:09:25.494 --> 01:09:28.037
It was a fake.
You're not a Jew.

1417
01:09:28.414 --> 01:09:30.665
No, it's true!
I'm Jewish, Cartman!

1418
01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:33.501
No, no, no, Kyle,
don't beat yourself up.

1419
01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:35.837
Why the fuck am I holding this thing?

1420
01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:38.131
Mr. Hat! Nooooo!

1421
01:09:38.215 --> 01:09:41.111
Goddamn it, for fuck's sake!
We gotta get out of here before it gets worse!

1422
01:09:41.135 --> 01:09:43.094
- Hear, hear.
- Stan!

1423
01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:44.239
Oh, man, I found the clitoris.

1424
01:09:44.263 --> 01:09:46.181
I think I'm gonna be able
to get Wendy to like me.

1425
01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:47.473
Oh, Stan, this is awesome!

1426
01:09:47.558 --> 01:09:49.119
Yeah, I guess all's well that ends well,
that ends well, huh?

1427
01:09:49.143 --> 01:09:51.102
Time to go home, assholes!

1428
01:09:51.937 --> 01:09:53.582
- Man, what's wrong with this thing?
- Let's go.

1429
01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:57.275
We can't let Terrence and Phillip die!
Otherwise, the world will end!

1430
01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:00.695
- Look, Terrence!
- There they are!

1431
01:10:00.779 --> 01:10:02.530
Phillip! Our song is over!

1432
01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:04.699
All right, men. Fire!

1433
01:10:04.783 --> 01:10:06.451
Goodbye, Terrence!

1434
01:10:10.998 --> 01:10:13.208
- What the hell is that?
- Don't shoot!

1435
01:10:13.667 --> 01:10:17.128
I'll take care of it.
Children, step aside now!

1436
01:10:22.635 --> 01:10:25.887
- Kyle!
- I'm not gonna let you kill them, mom.

1437
01:10:25.971 --> 01:10:27.180
What-what-what-what-what?!

1438
01:10:27.264 --> 01:10:28.848
I'm not moving!

1439
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:32.435
Stand down, children!

1440
01:10:32.519 --> 01:10:34.687
The Nickelodeon channel
is already full of toilet humor.

1441
01:10:34.772 --> 01:10:37.273
No, it's not just about
it's not just about toilet humor.

1442
01:10:37.358 --> 01:10:41.903
It's about freedom of speech,
censorship and all that. that sort of thing.

1443
01:10:41.987 --> 01:10:43.196
What about Ike? Huh, Mom?

1444
01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:46.658
Did you forget that your own
adopted son is Canadian?

1445
01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:50.912
Я... I've been, uh.
very important things!

1446
01:10:50.996 --> 01:10:53.581
But, mom, you never have time
to talk to me.

1447
01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:54.881
As soon as I get into something,

1448
01:10:54.905 --> 01:10:57.020
you lose your temper and you start
blaming someone else.

1449
01:10:57.044 --> 01:10:59.462
It's all my fault.
I'm the one who needs to be educated.

1450
01:10:59.546 --> 01:11:01.965
You're always hitting yourself
for no reason at all,

1451
01:11:02.049 --> 01:11:05.009
but I don't need a fighter.
I need a mom.

1452
01:11:09.306 --> 01:11:10.932
Poor kid!

1453
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:12.976
Noooo!

1454
01:11:13.602 --> 01:11:14.602
Terrence!

1455
01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:19.816
- Holy shit!
- Young man, watch your language!

1456
01:11:28.075 --> 01:11:30.034
It's my time!

1457
01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:32.370
Now you're all fucked!

1458
01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:34.872
It's Saddam Hussein!
Shoot him!

1459
01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:38.001
What a fucking asshole!

1460
01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:43.881
You've spilled the blood of innocents.

1461
01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:46.926
Let the two million years of darkness
two million years of darkness!

1462
01:11:47.011 --> 01:11:49.345
Well done, Mrs. Broflovski.
Thank you so much!

1463
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:52.807
I was just trying
to make the world a better place for children.

1464
01:11:52.891 --> 01:11:54.934
Yeah, and she's brought enough intolerance
a lot of intolerance,

1465
01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:56.644
so that my coming
to make my coming possible!

1466
01:11:56.729 --> 01:11:59.647
Now, everybody bow down
before me, now!

1467
01:12:02.693 --> 01:12:04.027
Get up!

1468
01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:06.029
Oh, what have we done...?

1469
01:12:06.113 --> 01:12:08.740
Saddam, you're not here,
I am the Dark Lord.

1470
01:12:08.824 --> 01:12:11.909
Relax, bitch.
Keep your mouth shut, you'll pass for smart.

1471
01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:13.411
Я... I can't.

1472
01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:16.122
For starters, erect
a huge statue in my honor

1473
01:12:16.206 --> 01:12:18.166
over there where the fat kid is standing.

1474
01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:20.918
Hey! Don't call me fat,
motherfucker!

1475
01:12:26.717 --> 01:12:28.593
Come on, Cartman! Hit it!

1476
01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:31.929
Fucking hell! Fuck!
Respect my fucking authority!

1477
01:12:33.474 --> 01:12:34.474
Yes!

1478
01:12:34.558 --> 01:12:37.226
Hey, asshole, watch your mouth!

1479
01:12:37.311 --> 01:12:39.103
Flatbread, flatbread!

1480
01:12:43.609 --> 01:12:45.234
Hurry, Satan,
do something!

1481
01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:47.278
Take it and sign it.

1482
01:12:47.821 --> 01:12:51.115
Bloody tampax popsicles!

1483
01:12:53.118 --> 01:12:57.622
Hey, buddy, I know I've been a jerk.
But don't worry, I'll make it up to you!

1484
01:12:59.124 --> 01:13:00.375
Uh-huh...

1485
01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:03.002
...now!

1486
01:13:04.338 --> 01:13:06.631
Fuck, shit, asshole,
dick, ass, tits.

1487
01:13:06.715 --> 01:13:09.050
bitch, shit, fuck,
asshole, asshole, asshole.

1488
01:13:09.134 --> 01:13:10.885
Barbra Streisand!

1489
01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:19.060
What are you waiting for, bitch?!
Kill him!

1490
01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:21.813
You stupid, brainless.
bucket of spunk! Save me!

1491
01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:23.398
That's it!

1492
01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:27.276
I've had enough!

1493
01:13:40.374 --> 01:13:43.876
He spent so much time convincing me
that I'm weak and stupid,

1494
01:13:43.961 --> 01:13:46.254
that I, uh. believed it myself.

1495
01:13:47.131 --> 01:13:49.298
I have to thank
you, oh, baby.

1496
01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:51.926
You showed me that I should have
to get away from him.

1497
01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:55.304
Make any wish you want,
and I will grant it.

1498
01:13:58.183 --> 01:14:00.226
- Are you sure, Kenny?
- What did he say?

1499
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:02.990
He said that he wished that everything
to go back to the way it was before,

1500
01:14:03.063 --> 01:14:04.939
before this terrible war.

1501
01:14:05.023 --> 01:14:08.609
Kenny, do you realize that then you're gonna have
you're gonna have to go back, too?

1502
01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:21.289
Then that's the way it's gonna be. All right, then,
I'm gonna call off all my handlers.

1503
01:14:21.373 --> 01:14:24.667
I guess I'm destined to dwell in hell.
Alone.

1504
01:14:26.378 --> 01:14:28.296
Hello. What's this?

1505
01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:33.050
Hey, buddy. How would you like
to go to hell with me?

1506
01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:37.472
Sure. I bet we could be
best friends, Mr. Satan?

1507
01:14:37.556 --> 01:14:40.475
You can visit us
whenever you want, Satan.

1508
01:14:40.559 --> 01:14:42.310
Why, I could.

1509
01:14:42.394 --> 01:14:43.394
Thank you, Kenny.

1510
01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:44.989
Thank you for coming back to hell
you're going back to hell.

1511
01:14:45.013 --> 01:14:46.647
You're a real buddy!

1512
01:14:51.069 --> 01:14:52.862
Goodbye, boys.

1513
01:15:05.417 --> 01:15:07.376
Я... am I alive?
Where's Mr. Hat?

1514
01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:10.087
Wow, we were all dying,
and now we're okay.

1515
01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:11.756
That's awesome!

1516
01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:14.008
What the fuck?

1517
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:19.138
See, mom? At the end of the day,

1518
01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:21.849
it was Cartman's cesspool fucking
that saved us.

1519
01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:24.977
I'm sorry I haven't been paying
to you, Kyle.

1520
01:15:27.439 --> 01:15:29.106
Wait, Wendy, what about Gregory?

1521
01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:31.031
Ah, Stan, I've never been
much interest in him.

1522
01:15:31.109 --> 01:15:32.818
- Is that so?
- Not a bit. Fuck Gregory!

1523
01:15:32.903 --> 01:15:36.197
- Fuck him in the ear!
- Aha! Thank you, clitoris!
