00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:17.856
The United States has graphic violence
on television all the time.

341
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.023
We can't believe that a movie

342
00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:20.567
with some foul language
would piss you off so much.

343
00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:21.860
Because it's evil!

Okay, I'm finished.

346
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.366
But, Mr. Minister, it isn't like this film

347
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:30.326
is the first troublesome thing
to come out of Canada.

348
00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:31.995
Let us not forget Bryan Adams.

349
00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:33.663
Now, now. The Canadian government
has apologized

350
00:14:33.747 --> 00:14:35.164
for Bryan Adams on several occasions.

351
00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:36.708
You Canadians are all the same,

352
00:14:36.792 --> 00:14:38.877

and flapping heads!

353
00:14:38.961 --> 00:14:40.962
- You're trash.
- I resent that! I find that racist!

354
00:14:41.046 --> 00:14:42.630
Our children are now addicted
to your filth!

355
00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:44.382
You are a racist, ma'am.
You are a racist.

356
00:14:44.466 --> 00:14:45.925
It is going to take us weeks

357
00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.262
to erase the damage
this film has done to our children!

358
00:14:52.349 --> 00:14:55.727
Kids, I wanna welcome you
to rehabilitation, m'kay?

359
00:14:55.811 --> 00:14:58.897
Your mothers insisted that you be taken
from your normal schoolwork

360
00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:01.482
and placed into rehab
to learn not to swear.

361
00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:03.234
I must say, I don't think I belong
with these rogues.

362
00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:06.029
I attended school at Yardale
and had a 4.0 grade point average.

This is exactly what I'm talking about.

365

and sex with women, m'kay?

369
00:15:22.379 --> 00:15:24.923
But it's when you do these things
too much

370
00:15:25.007 --> 00:15:29.677

and must get back in touch

It's all up to you, m'kay?

the Olympics skating for the gold

He did two salchows and a triple Lutz
while wearing a blindfold

890

When Brian Boitano was in the Alps
fighting grizzly bears

Till only the righteous stand

1186
00:49:52.364 --> 00:49:55.658
You see the distant flames
They bellow in the night

1187
00:49:55.742 --> 00:49:59.036
You fight in all our names
for what we know is right

1188
00:49:59.121 --> 00:50:02.248
And when you all get shot
and cannot carry on

1189
00:50:02.332 --> 00:50:05.251
Though you die, la Rèsistance lives on

1190
00:50:05.752 --> 00:50:08.963
ALL: You may get stabbed
in the head with a dagger or a sword

1191
00:50:09.047 --> 00:50:12.133
You may be burned to death
or skinned alive or worse

1192
00:50:12.217 --> 00:50:15.011
But when they torture you
you will not feel the need to run

1193
00:50:15.095 --> 00:50:18.180
For though you die
la Rèsistance lives on

1194

WOMEN: Blame Canada!
Blame Canada!

1195

Our lives will change

What a sight

1199
00:50:35.282 --> 00:50:36.240
Tomorrow night

1200
00:50:36.324 --> 00:50:38.993
Up there, there is so much room
Where babies burp and flowers bloom

1201
00:50:39.077 --> 00:50:42.204
Tomorrow night, up there is doomed
And so I will be going soon

1202

BOTH: Shut your fucking face,
uncle fucka

1203

You're a boner-biting bastard
Uncle fucka

Looks like we may be out of luck

1205

Tomorrow night, we're pretty fucked

1206
00:50:51.465 --> 00:50:52.882
Why did our mothers start this war?

1207
00:50:52.966 --> 00:50:54.467
What the fuck are they fighting for?

1208
00:50:54.551 --> 00:50:56.469
When did this song
become a marathon?

1209
00:50:56.553 --> 00:50:58.888
- I want to be up there...
- When Canada is dead and gone

1210
00:50:58.972 --> 00:51:00.431
There'll be no more Celine Dion!

1211
00:51:00.515 --> 00:51:03.601
They might cut your dick in half
and serve it to a pig

1212
00:51:03.685 --> 00:51:06.645
And though it hurts
you'll laugh and dance a dickless jig

1213
00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:09.523
But that's the way it goes
In war, you're shat upon

Oh, boy, I'm so excited!

1219

Just one more day
until we can take over the world.

1220

I don't know if I can sleep,
if you know what I mean.

1221
00:51:32.547 --> 00:51:33.964
This book is really interesting.

1222
00:51:34.049 --> 00:51:36.425
It talks about how people
communicate differently.

1223
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:39.762
Like, I communicate by wanting you
to ask me questions, and you...

1224
00:51:39.846 --> 00:51:41.430
Hey, that is interesting! Let's fuck!

Hey, Satan.

Oh! Now that is just not appropriate!

1229

Come on, I'm just fucking with you!
It's not real!

1230

It's Saddam,
he doesn't nurture my emotions.

Ike, you have to stay in the attic
'cause if they find you,

1251
00:52:43.076 --> 00:52:46.287
they'll put you
in a Canadian concentration camp.

1252

Don't worry, Ike,
we're gonna put an end to this.

- Hi. We need to speak with The Mole.

I'm sorry, The Mole is grounded.
He can't come out and play.

- What?
- He's a kid?

1259
00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.033
He said very naughty things about God.

- That Gregory kid.

He said you could sneak us in.

1266
00:53:38.465 --> 00:53:41.008
Are you telling me that you intend to
break into the USO show,

1267

filled with thousands of soldiers,
and break out Terrance and Phillip?

1268
00:53:44.512 --> 00:53:46.263

that's why.

1349
00:57:56.556 --> 00:57:59.057
Be careful not to touch this wire.

1350
00:57:59.684 --> 00:58:01.226
(GROANING) Motherfucker...

1351
00:58:01.519 --> 00:58:02.728
Fuck...

1352

(GROANING)

1353
00:58:08.401 --> 00:58:11.904
Shit, the USO show has started!
We are running out of time!

1354
00:58:11.988 --> 00:58:13.322
Do you see Terrance and Phillip?

1355
00:58:13.406 --> 00:58:15.908
Yes, but they are heavily guarded.

1356
00:58:15.992 --> 00:58:17.868
We have to dig from here
so as not to be seen.

1357
00:58:17.952 --> 00:58:19.036
Come on, bitches.

1358
00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:22.873
Hey, Mole,
do you know where the clitoris is?

1359
00:58:22.957 --> 00:58:24.082
- The what?
- The clitoris.

1360
00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:26.710
I have to find the clitoris so I can
get this Wendy girl to like me again.

1361
00:58:26.794 --> 00:58:28.504
You need to stop thinking
with your dick!

1362
00:58:28.588 --> 00:58:29.630
You have to be on your toes

1363
00:58:29.714 --> 00:58:31.173
because I am not going to be
grounded again!

1364
00:58:31.257 --> 00:58:32.925
Not for you. Not for anybody.

1365
00:58:33.343 --> 00:58:36.178
Men, when you're out there
in the battlefield

1366
00:58:36.262 --> 00:58:38.680
and you're looking into the beady eyes
of a Canadian

1367
00:58:38.765 --> 00:58:41.725
as he charges you with his hockey stick
or whatever he has

1368
00:58:41.809 --> 00:58:43.894
and people are dying all around you,

1369
00:58:43.978 --> 00:58:46.480
just remember what the M. P.A.A. says.

1370
00:58:46.564 --> 00:58:49.358
"Horrific, deplorable violence is okay,

1371
00:58:49.442 --> 00:58:52.194
"as long as people don't say
any naughty words!"

1372
00:58:52.278 --> 00:58:55.072
That is what this war is all about!

1373
00:58:55.156 --> 00:58:56.657
(LOUD CHEERING)

1374
00:58:56.741 --> 00:58:57.824
What?

1375
00:59:00.078 --> 00:59:01.203
Shit!

1376
00:59:03.248 --> 00:59:04.706
Move, move!

1377
00:59:05.959 --> 00:59:09.461
Okay. We will split up here.
Let's synchronize watches.

1378
00:59:09.879 --> 00:59:11.713
- We don't have watches.
- You don't have watches?

1379
00:59:11.798 --> 00:59:12.881
Dude, you didn't say
anything about watches!

1380
00:59:12.966 --> 00:59:14.091
What do you think this is, kid?

1381
00:59:14.175 --> 00:59:15.551
TV kiddie-hour where we all sit around

1382
00:59:15.635 --> 00:59:17.678
and lick Barney
the dinosaur's fucking pussy, huh?

1383
00:59:17.762 --> 00:59:19.763
This is real life, with consequences
you take to the grave!

1384
00:59:19.847 --> 00:59:22.641
- Dude, we don't have watches.
- Shit! Did you bring the mirror?

1385
00:59:22.725 --> 00:59:23.725
- Got it!
- And the rope?

1386
00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:25.435
- Check.
- And the buttfor?

1387
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:28.230
- What's a buttfor?
- For pooping, silly.

1388
00:59:30.233 --> 00:59:32.401
Now, listen carefully.
I will dig under the stage,

1389
00:59:32.485 --> 00:59:33.944
and with that bedrock,
I will need more time.

1390
00:59:34.028 --> 00:59:36.738
Stan and Kyle, get near that stage
and stall the show any way you can.

1391
00:59:36.823 --> 00:59:38.156
Do whatever it takes
to keep that show going

1392
00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:39.950
- until I get to the prisoners.
- Okay.

1393
00:59:40.034 --> 00:59:41.952
THE MOLE: Cartman,
over there is the electrical box.

1394
00:59:42.036 --> 00:59:43.453
You must sneak over there
and shut it off

1395
00:59:43.538 --> 00:59:44.913
before I return with Terrance and Phillip

1396
00:59:44.998 --> 00:59:47.499
or the alarms will sound
and I will be attacked by guard dogs.

1397
00:59:47.584 --> 00:59:48.834
- Got it?
- Okay.

1398
00:59:48.918 --> 00:59:51.378
You must shut off the alarms!
I fucking hate guard dogs!

1399
00:59:51.462 --> 00:59:52.838
I heard you the first time,
you British piece of shit.

1400

(GROANS)

1401
00:59:54.007 --> 00:59:56.758
If anything goes wrong,
make a sound like a dying giraffe.

1402
00:59:56.843 --> 00:59:58.677
What's a dying giraffe sound like?

1403
00:59:58.761 --> 01:00:01.305
(GROANING)

1404
01:00:02.223 --> 01:00:03.515
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1405
01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.183
- Be careful, dude.
- Careful?

1406
01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:07.477
Was my mother careful
when she stabbed me in the heart

1407
01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:10.856
with a clothes hanger
while I was still in the womb?

1408
01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:16.445
Damn, dude. That kid is fucked up.

1409
01:00:16.529 --> 01:00:20.324
- How are those chairs coming, Sheila?
- Al, we're minutes away.

1410
01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:22.409
Super! In the meantime,

1411
01:00:22.493 --> 01:00:28.165
here's pint-size pixie and darling of
the indie movie scene, Winona Ryder!

1412
01:00:28.374 --> 01:00:29.374
Hi, guys.

1414
01:00:30.543 --> 01:00:32.336
I'm super psyched to be here today.

1415
01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:35.714
What you're doing
for our country is so cool.

1416
01:00:36.257 --> 01:00:40.427
I mean war, man. Wow. War, you know?

1417
01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:42.137
Wow.

1418
01:00:42.221 --> 01:00:46.933
Okay! And now for your enjoyment,
here's my famous ping-pong ball trick!

1419
01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:56.568

what Winona Ryder's doing?

1423
01:01:03.409 --> 01:01:05.202
We can't miss this.

1424
01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:10.582
There, I didn't miss one!

we have for you tonight,

Well, I do have a little song
I wrote about the war.

1436

But we haven't rehearsed.

- Sing it!
- SOLDIERS: Yeah, sing it!

- Oh! I can't.
- KYLE: Sing the fucking song!

Well, all right, if you insist,
I'll sing my song.

1440

I'm super, thanks for asking

for you right now
