00:00:43.575 --> 00:00:45.783
Oh.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.200
<i>Montauk train on Track "B."</i>

3
00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:42.617
<i>Random thoughts
for Valentine's Day, 2004.</i>

4
00:01:44.575 --> 00:01:46.908
<i>Today is a holiday invented
by greeting card companies...</i>

5
00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:50.575
<i>to make people
feel like crap.</i>

6
00:01:54.325 --> 00:01:56.200
<i>I ditched work today.</i>

7
00:01:58.825 --> 00:02:00.700
<i>Took a train out to Montauk.</i>

8
00:02:03.242 --> 00:02:04.992
<i>I don't know why.</i>

9
00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:06.492
Aah!

10
00:02:06.658 --> 00:02:08.908
<i>I'm not an impulsive person.</i>

11
00:02:16.492 --> 00:02:18.908
<i>I guess I just woke up
in a funk this morning.</i>

12
00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:22.033
<i>I gotta get my car fixed.</i>

13
00:02:22.492 --> 00:02:23.575
Hi. Cindy?

14
00:02:23.742 --> 00:02:25.533
It's Joel.

15
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.200
Joel!

16
00:02:27.367 --> 00:02:29.367
Listen, I don't feel
very well today.

17
00:02:30.825 --> 00:02:32.783
No, food poisoning,
I think.

18
00:02:33.325 --> 00:02:36.325
<i>It's goddamn freezing
on this beach.</i>

19
00:02:36.492 --> 00:02:39.658
<i>Montauk in February.
Brilliant, Joel.</i>

20
00:02:41.658 --> 00:02:43.408
<i>Page is ripped out.</i>

21
00:02:43.575 --> 00:02:45.283
<i>Don't remember doing that.</i>

22
00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:51.075
<i>It appears this is my first entry
in two years.</i>

23
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.700
<i>Sand is overrated.</i>

24
00:03:03.367 --> 00:03:05.242
<i>It's just tiny little rocks.</i>

25
00:03:15.158 --> 00:03:16.867
<i>If only I could meet
someone new-</i>

26
00:03:18.658 --> 00:03:21.742
<i>I guess my chances of that happening
are somewhat diminished,</i>

27
00:03:21.908 --> 00:03:26.033
<i>seeing that I'm incapable of making
eye contact with a woman I don't know.</i>

28
00:03:27.492 --> 00:03:30.325
<i>Maybe I should
get back together with Naomi.</i>

29
00:03:30.492 --> 00:03:32.450
<i>She was nice.</i>

30
00:03:32.617 --> 00:03:34.158
<i>Nice is good.</i>

31
00:03:36.158 --> 00:03:38.075
<i>She loved me.</i>

32
00:03:41.367 --> 00:03:43.575
<i>David...</i>

33
00:03:54.908 --> 00:03:56.200
Hi. How are you?

34
00:04:14.992 --> 00:04:17.908
<i>Why do I fall in love
with every woman I see</i>

35
00:04:18.075 --> 00:04:20.242
<i>who shows me
the least bit of attention?</i>

36
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:02.950
Hi.

37
00:05:04.242 --> 00:05:06.242
- I'm sorry?
- I just said hi.

38
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.617
Hi. Hello. Hi.

39
00:05:09.825 --> 00:05:11.325
Okay if I sit closer?

40
00:05:14.367 --> 00:05:17.825
- How far are you going?
- Uh, Rockville Center.

41
00:05:17.992 --> 00:05:20.117
Get out! Me too.

42
00:05:20.283 --> 00:05:22.908
- Really?
- What are the odds?

43
00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.117
Do I know you?

44
00:05:30.367 --> 00:05:31.950
Do you ever shop
at Barnes & Noble?

45
00:05:32.117 --> 00:05:34.200
- Sure. Hmm.
- That's it!

46
00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:36.658
- Yeah?
- I've seen you, man!

47
00:05:37.325 --> 00:05:40.908
Book slave there for,
like, five years now.

48
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.492
- Ah.
- Jesus!

49
00:05:42.658 --> 00:05:43.783
I would have thought
I would've remembered you.

50
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.450
Is it five years?
It might be the hair.

51
00:05:46.617 --> 00:05:48.742
- What might?
- It changes a lot.

52
00:05:48.908 --> 00:05:52.033
The color. That's why you might not
recognize me.

53
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.075
- It's called Blue Ruin.
- Right.

54
00:05:54.242 --> 00:05:55.742
The color.

55
00:05:55.908 --> 00:05:57.992
- Snappy name, huh?
- I like it.

56
00:05:58.158 --> 00:05:59.158
Yeah.

57
00:06:00.867 --> 00:06:03.908
Anyway, this company makes a whole line
of colors with equally snappy names.

58
00:06:04.617 --> 00:06:08.033
Red--Red Menace, Yellow Fever,
Green Revolution.

59
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.408
That'd be a job,
coming up with those names.

60
00:06:11.575 --> 00:06:14.242
You think there could
possibly be a job like that?

61
00:06:14.408 --> 00:06:16.617
I mean, how many hair colors
could there <i>be?</i>

62
00:06:17.242 --> 00:06:19.908
- Fifty, maybe.
- Someone's got that job.

63
00:06:21.658 --> 00:06:24.283
Agent Orange!
I came up with that one.

64
00:06:25.325 --> 00:06:28.117
I apply my personality
in a paste.

65
00:06:28.283 --> 00:06:29.950
Oh, I doubt that very much.

66
00:06:31.242 --> 00:06:33.075
Well, you don't know me, so...

67
00:06:34.033 --> 00:06:35.658
you don't know, do you?

68
00:06:38.992 --> 00:06:42.200
Sorry. I was just...
I'm trying to be nice.

69
00:06:43.533 --> 00:06:45.783
Yeah. Yeah. I got it.

70
00:07:05.617 --> 00:07:07.825
My name is Clementine,
by the way.

71
00:07:07.992 --> 00:07:09.783
- I'm Joel.
- Hi, Joel.

72
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:10.908
Hey.

73
00:07:11.825 --> 00:07:13.617
No jokes about my name.

74
00:07:13.783 --> 00:07:17.492
Oh, no, you wouldn't do that.
You're trying to be nice.

75
00:07:18.283 --> 00:07:20.700
I don't know any jokes
about your name.

76
00:07:20.867 --> 00:07:22.408
Huckleberry Hound.

77
00:07:23.867 --> 00:07:25.658
I don't know
what that means.

78
00:07:25.825 --> 00:07:28.825
Huckleberry Hound?
What are you, nuts?

79
00:07:28.992 --> 00:07:30.867
It's been suggested.

80
00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:34.033
♪ Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin' Clementine ♪

81
00:07:34.575 --> 00:07:37.242
♪ You are lost
and gone forever ♪

82
00:07:37.408 --> 00:07:38.700
♪ Dreadful sorry,
Clementine ♪

83
00:07:38.867 --> 00:07:40.700
No?

84
00:07:40.867 --> 00:07:44.742
I'm sorry. Just--it's a pretty name
though. It really is nice.

85
00:07:44.908 --> 00:07:46.992
It's, uh--
It means "merciful."

86
00:07:47.158 --> 00:07:48.908
Right? Clemency?

87
00:07:49.658 --> 00:07:51.158
Although it hardly fits.

88
00:07:51.325 --> 00:07:53.492
I'm a vindictive little bitch,
truth be told.

89
00:07:53.658 --> 00:07:55.992
Gee, I-I wouldn't
think that about you.

90
00:07:56.158 --> 00:07:57.950
Why wouldn't you
think that about me?

91
00:07:58.117 --> 00:07:59.825
I don't know.
I just--

92
00:08:01.825 --> 00:08:03.658
I don't know.
I just, uh--

93
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.908
You seem nice, so--

94
00:08:06.075 --> 00:08:08.117
Oh, now I'm nice?

95
00:08:08.283 --> 00:08:11.200
Oh, God. Don't you know
any other adjectives?

96
00:08:11.367 --> 00:08:12.658
I don't need "nice."

97
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.158
I don't need myself to be it, and I don't
need anybody else to be it at me.

98
00:08:16.325 --> 00:08:17.325
Okay.

99
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.033
<i>Joel?</i>

100
00:08:23.325 --> 00:08:24.742
It's Joel, right?

101
00:08:26.075 --> 00:08:27.075
Yes.

102
00:08:28.867 --> 00:08:30.492
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

103
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.408
I'm a little out of sorts today.

104
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.408
My embarrassing admission is,

105
00:08:45.575 --> 00:08:47.700
I really like
that you're nice right now.

106
00:08:47.867 --> 00:08:51.783
I mean, I can't tell from one moment
to the next what I'm gonna like,

107
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.242
but right now...

108
00:08:55.783 --> 00:08:57.617
I'm glad you are.

109
00:09:05.158 --> 00:09:08.575
I have some stuff that,
uh, I probably should, uh--

110
00:09:11.242 --> 00:09:13.617
- Oh! I'm sorry. Okay.
- I-I'm writing, and--

111
00:09:13.783 --> 00:09:15.492
- No, no. I just--
- Sure. No. That's okay.

112
00:09:15.658 --> 00:09:18.575
- I just have--You know, this is--
- Okay.

113
00:09:18.742 --> 00:09:20.492
- Oh! Hey!
- Take care, then.

114
00:09:20.658 --> 00:09:21.658
Jesus!

115
00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:39.908
Hi. I could, uh,
give you a ride, if you need.

116
00:09:41.242 --> 00:09:42.617
It's cold.

117
00:09:42.783 --> 00:09:44.158
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah?

118
00:09:44.325 --> 00:09:45.908
It is frosty.

119
00:09:46.075 --> 00:09:48.742
- You're not a stalker or anything, right?
- I'm not a stalker.

120
00:09:48.908 --> 00:09:50.867
You're the one that talked to me.
Remember?

121
00:09:51.033 --> 00:09:52.908
That is the oldest trick
in the stalker book.

122
00:09:53.075 --> 00:09:55.325
Really?
There's a stalker book?

123
00:09:55.908 --> 00:09:57.575
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

124
00:09:58.325 --> 00:09:59.908
I gotta read that one.

125
00:10:05.158 --> 00:10:07.867
Look, I'm sorry
if I came off sorta nutso.

126
00:10:08.033 --> 00:10:09.575
I'm not, really.

127
00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:12.867
Oh, it's okay.
I didn't think you were.

128
00:10:19.408 --> 00:10:20.867
Do you wanna have a drink?

129
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.617
I have lots of drinks,
and I could, um--

130
00:10:23.783 --> 00:10:24.742
Um...

131
00:10:26.117 --> 00:10:27.950
Never mind.

132
00:10:28.117 --> 00:10:29.117
Sorry. That was stupid.

133
00:10:29.283 --> 00:10:30.450
- I'm embarrassed now.
- No, no, no, no.

134
00:10:30.617 --> 00:10:32.325
Good night, Joel.

135
00:10:52.075 --> 00:10:53.617
Two Blue Ruins.

136
00:10:55.783 --> 00:10:56.783
Thank you.

137
00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:58.658
Drink up, young man.

138
00:10:59.408 --> 00:11:01.783
It'll make the whole seduction part
less repugnant.

139
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:06.867
I'm just kidding!

140
00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:08.492
Come on.

141
00:11:15.117 --> 00:11:16.908
You're kinda closed-mouthed,
aren't you?

142
00:11:17.075 --> 00:11:18.617
I'm sorry.

143
00:11:19.242 --> 00:11:23.408
It's just, you know, my life
isn't that interesting.

144
00:11:24.617 --> 00:11:27.033
I go to work, I come home.

145
00:11:28.492 --> 00:11:29.825
Don't know what to say.

146
00:11:31.075 --> 00:11:33.658
You should read my journal.
Uh, there's--

147
00:11:33.825 --> 00:11:37.492
I mean, it's just...blank.

148
00:11:37.658 --> 00:11:40.783
Really? Does that make you
sad or anxious?

149
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:41.950
I mean, I'm always anxious,

150
00:11:42.117 --> 00:11:44.117
thinking I'm not living my life
to the fullest, you know?

151
00:11:44.283 --> 00:11:46.033
Taking advantage of every possibility,

152
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.450
making sure I'm not wasting one second
of the little time I have.

153
00:11:49.908 --> 00:11:52.325
- I think about that.
- Yeah?

154
00:11:57.158 --> 00:11:58.867
You're really nice.

155
00:11:59.033 --> 00:12:02.117
- Oh!
- God, I have to stop saying that.

156
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.825
I'm gonna marry you.

157
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.200
I know it.

158
00:12:08.367 --> 00:12:10.283
Um...okay.

159
00:12:15.658 --> 00:12:19.950
Joel, you should come up to the Charles
with me sometime.

160
00:12:20.117 --> 00:12:22.158
It gets frozen
this time of year.

161
00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:24.033
- That sounds scary.
- Exactly.

162
00:12:25.158 --> 00:12:27.033
I'll pack a picnic.

163
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.075
A night picnic.
Night picnics are different.

164
00:12:30.242 --> 00:12:32.408
And, um, we could--

165
00:12:32.575 --> 00:12:33.908
Sounds good.

166
00:12:35.242 --> 00:12:37.575
But I--I should, uh, go.
Now.

167
00:12:38.783 --> 00:12:40.700
- You should stay.
- No, I really--

168
00:12:40.867 --> 00:12:43.992
I'm--I--
I have to get up so early.

169
00:12:44.158 --> 00:12:45.783
I would like you to call me.

170
00:12:46.075 --> 00:12:48.742
Would you do that?
I would like it.

171
00:12:48.908 --> 00:12:50.283
Yes.

172
00:12:54.325 --> 00:12:56.575
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day
when you call!

173
00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:58.950
That'd be nice.

174
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.783
<i>What took you so long?</i>

175
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:43.533
I just walked in.

176
00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.075
<i>Mm-hmm. You miss me?</i>

177
00:13:46.783 --> 00:13:48.783
Yeah.
Oddly enough, I do.

178
00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:50.658
<i>Oh!</i>

179
00:13:50.825 --> 00:13:53.242
<i>You said "I do. " I guess
that means were married.</i>

180
00:13:53.408 --> 00:13:55.408
I guess so.

181
00:13:55.575 --> 00:13:58.367
<i>Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?</i>

182
00:13:58.533 --> 00:14:00.783
It's really solid this time of year.

183
00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:02.783
Whoa! I don't know.

184
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:04.617
- Come on. Come on.
- Eee!

185
00:14:04.783 --> 00:14:06.867
Come on.
Come on, come on.

186
00:14:07.033 --> 00:14:10.283
Whew.

187
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:13.617
Oh. So beautiful.

188
00:14:15.283 --> 00:14:16.825
Isn't it?

189
00:14:20.117 --> 00:14:21.783
Uh, don't go too far.

190
00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:24.617
- Whoo! Ow! Ow!
- Whoa! Oh!

191
00:14:24.992 --> 00:14:28.158
- Are you okay?
- Ouch! Fuck it.

192
00:14:29.075 --> 00:14:32.283
Oh! Oh, my ass!

193
00:14:34.617 --> 00:14:35.700
- I think I should go back.
- Come on.

194
00:14:35.867 --> 00:14:36.950
- Huh?
- Come on!

195
00:14:37.117 --> 00:14:38.825
What if it breaks?

196
00:14:38.992 --> 00:14:40.700
"What if"? Do you really
care right now?

197
00:14:41.242 --> 00:14:43.825
- Huh?
- Come here. Please.

198
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.700
Come on.

199
00:14:49.242 --> 00:14:51.617
- Ohh.
- Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

200
00:14:51.783 --> 00:14:54.242
- Slidey-slidey. Slidey-slidey.
- Whoa!

201
00:14:54.867 --> 00:14:57.450
- This is good.
- Here, let me show you this one thing.

202
00:14:58.158 --> 00:15:00.075
What are you doing?
Whoa.

203
00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:03.825
Come on.

204
00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:10.992
Think I heard a crack.

205
00:15:11.492 --> 00:15:14.742
It's not gonna crack or break or--

206
00:15:14.908 --> 00:15:16.700
It's so thick.

207
00:15:18.617 --> 00:15:21.158
Show me which
constellations you know.

208
00:15:21.325 --> 00:15:22.992
Um. Oh.

209
00:15:24.117 --> 00:15:26.242
I don't...know any.

210
00:15:28.033 --> 00:15:30.158
Show me which ones
you know.

211
00:15:30.325 --> 00:15:31.742
Okay.

212
00:15:32.825 --> 00:15:34.242
Okay.

213
00:15:35.617 --> 00:15:38.992
Oh. There's Osidius.

214
00:15:39.158 --> 00:15:40.742
Where?

215
00:15:40.908 --> 00:15:42.783
Right there. See?

216
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:45.742
It's sort of a swoop
and a cross.

217
00:15:45.908 --> 00:15:47.325
Osidius the Emphatic.

218
00:15:49.575 --> 00:15:52.075
- You're full of shit. Right?
- Nope.

219
00:15:52.242 --> 00:15:55.158
Osidius is right there.
Swoop and cross.

220
00:15:55.325 --> 00:15:58.158
Shut the fuck up!

221
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:11.325
Clementine.

222
00:16:11.492 --> 00:16:13.492
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

223
00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:18.325
- Hey.
- Hey.

224
00:16:18.492 --> 00:16:21.867
- Hey.
- Sorry to wake you, but we're...here.

225
00:16:23.408 --> 00:16:25.492
Ah.

226
00:16:30.908 --> 00:16:32.575
Can I come over
to your house...

227
00:16:34.283 --> 00:16:35.617
to sleep?

228
00:16:36.242 --> 00:16:39.033
I'm so tired.

229
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.992
Okay. Um, yeah. Sure.

230
00:16:42.158 --> 00:16:44.908
- Let me get my toothbrush.
- Yeah. Oh.

231
00:16:45.783 --> 00:16:47.075
You--

232
00:16:48.367 --> 00:16:49.367
Just--

233
00:17:06.867 --> 00:17:07.867
Yes?

234
00:17:08.992 --> 00:17:12.117
- Can I help you?
- What do you mean?

235
00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:15.783
Can I help you with something?

236
00:17:16.742 --> 00:17:18.117
No.

237
00:17:19.033 --> 00:17:20.283
What are you doing here?

238
00:17:20.783 --> 00:17:23.283
I'm not really sure
what you're asking me.

239
00:17:24.283 --> 00:17:25.450
Oh.

240
00:17:26.367 --> 00:17:27.533
Thanks.

What number's that?

247
00:19:19.408 --> 00:19:21.242
I don't know where that is.

248
00:19:21.408 --> 00:19:24.492
Jesus Christ, you'd think they'd light
the number, or at least put a number on--

249
00:19:24.658 --> 00:19:26.242
- Is that him?
- I think so.

250
00:19:26.408 --> 00:19:28.992
Yeah, that's him.
Wait. That's him.

251
00:19:44.617 --> 00:19:46.742
- Hey, Joel.
- Frank.

252
00:19:49.617 --> 00:19:51.367
Oh, shit.

253
00:19:52.242 --> 00:19:56.033
Jesus. The only Valentine's Day cards
I get are from my mother.

254
00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.450
How pathetic
is that, huh?

255
00:19:58.617 --> 00:20:01.658
You're lucky you have Clementine, man.
She is way cool.

256
00:20:02.283 --> 00:20:04.450
Hey, you got any big Valentine's Day
plans with her?

257
00:20:07.992 --> 00:20:09.575
No.

258
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:12.783
Well, it's only a day away. Better make
some reservations or something.

259
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.117
Don't want to end up at Mickey D's. Right?

260
00:20:15.283 --> 00:20:16.825
McRomance!

261
00:20:16.992 --> 00:20:18.825
You want some fries
with that shake?

262
00:20:18.992 --> 00:20:21.783
I-I have to, uh,
go to sleep now, Frank.

263
00:20:22.908 --> 00:20:23.908
It's 8:30.

264
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.450
Patrick, stop it.

265
00:21:11.783 --> 00:21:13.783
Oh! Okay.

266
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.742
Okay. Okay.

267
00:21:17.408 --> 00:21:19.533
Okay.

268
00:21:21.867 --> 00:21:23.700
Showtime at the Apollo.

269
00:21:33.283 --> 00:21:34.825
Shh, shh, shh. Hey.

270
00:21:35.992 --> 00:21:37.658
Quiet.

271
00:21:46.825 --> 00:21:48.117
Get it off your head.

272
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:52.575
<i>Hey, Joel. What's up?</i>

273
00:21:53.117 --> 00:21:54.867
<i>Oh. Hi, Frank.</i>

274
00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.075
I only get Valentine's Day
cards from my mom.

275
00:22:04.492 --> 00:22:06.950
How pathetic is that?

276
00:22:07.117 --> 00:22:09.158
You're lucky
you have Clementine, Joel.

277
00:22:09.658 --> 00:22:13.117
Hey, you got, uh, any, uh,
big Valentine's Day plans with her?

278
00:22:14.283 --> 00:22:15.742
No.

279
00:22:15.908 --> 00:22:17.617
It's only a day away.

280
00:22:17.783 --> 00:22:19.408
Better make a reservation
or something.

281
00:22:20.033 --> 00:22:22.117
Don't wanna end up
at Mickey D's.

282
00:22:22.283 --> 00:22:24.200
<i>Oh, no!</i>

283
00:22:24.367 --> 00:22:27.117
Yes! You know, Valentine's Day
is three goddamn days away!

284
00:22:27.283 --> 00:22:28.783
I want it resolved.

285
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:30.783
I'm willing to be the one
to resolve it.

286
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:34.075
So I call her,
and she's changed her number.

287
00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:37.367
<i>So I walked over to Antic Attic,
you know, to get her something.</i>

288
00:22:37.575 --> 00:22:42.200
I thought, you know, I'd go over to work,
give her an early valentine, and--

289
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.658
You won't believe it.

290
00:22:45.283 --> 00:22:47.158
She's there with...

291
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:50.992
this guy,
this really young guy.

292
00:22:51.867 --> 00:22:54.950
And she looks at me like
she doesn't even know who I am.

293
00:22:55.867 --> 00:22:56.992
Excuse me?

294
00:22:58.033 --> 00:22:59.408
Can I help you
find something, sir?

295
00:23:03.783 --> 00:23:05.283
Hey, Clem-ato.

296
00:23:05.867 --> 00:23:09.117
Patrick! Baby boy.

297
00:23:12.325 --> 00:23:14.658
- What you doing here, baby?
- Just came to surprise you.

298
00:23:14.825 --> 00:23:18.533
Let me know if you need something, sir.
You look good.

299
00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.867
How are you?

300
00:23:21.033 --> 00:23:22.783
Pretty good. Pretty bored. Pretty tired.

301
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:24.367
Uh-huh.

302
00:23:24.533 --> 00:23:25.700
I so want what's in your suit.

303
00:23:25.867 --> 00:23:26.742
Oh, good.

304
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.575
Why?

305
00:23:41.617 --> 00:23:42.992
Why would she
do that to me?

306
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:49.408
Hey, does anybody
want a joint?

307
00:23:49.575 --> 00:23:52.450
Oh, God, Rob,
give it a rest.

308
00:23:52.617 --> 00:23:54.700
Oh, God.
She's punishing me.

309
00:23:54.867 --> 00:23:56.325
- I know, honey.
- For being honest.

310
00:23:56.492 --> 00:23:58.533
- It's horrible.
- I should just go to her house.

311
00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:01.992
No! No, no, no. You don't wanna go there,
man. You don't wanna go there.

312
00:24:02.158 --> 00:24:03.908
Get off. It's too--

313
00:24:04.075 --> 00:24:05.492
- Right.
- Yeah.

314
00:24:05.658 --> 00:24:07.450
I don't want
to seem desperate.

315
00:24:07.617 --> 00:24:12.408
Joel, why don't you just see this as
a sign, make a clean break. Right?

316
00:24:12.575 --> 00:24:15.533
Right?

317
00:24:17.575 --> 00:24:20.158
All right, Joel.
Look, man, seriously.

318
00:24:20.325 --> 00:24:21.908
- Rob!
- Here's the deal.

319
00:24:22.075 --> 00:24:24.908
Don't do that. Rob, what are you doing?
No, no, no, no.

320
00:24:25.075 --> 00:24:26.867
Well, what's your fucking
suggestion, Carrie?

321
00:24:27.033 --> 00:24:28.742
What's your brilliant,
reasoned solution?

322
00:24:28.908 --> 00:24:30.825
You're gonna make this about our shit now?
This isn't about us.

323
00:24:30.992 --> 00:24:34.950
I agree. It's not about us.
It's about Joel, who's an adult. Okay?

324
00:24:35.117 --> 00:24:37.033
Not Mama Carrie's kid.

325
00:24:38.825 --> 00:24:41.158
- What are you--
- That's your laundry!

326
00:24:43.033 --> 00:24:46.367
That's great. That's good.

327
00:24:57.242 --> 00:24:58.242
Okay.

328
00:25:05.367 --> 00:25:06.867
- What is it?
- I don't know.

329
00:25:07.033 --> 00:25:09.325
It's some place
that does a thing.

330
00:25:21.992 --> 00:25:23.408
Good morning. Lacuna.

331
00:25:24.617 --> 00:25:28.575
No, I'm sorry.
That offer expired after the New Year.

332
00:25:30.283 --> 00:25:33.200
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in--

333
00:25:33.533 --> 00:25:35.117
How about on the fifth?

334
00:25:35.783 --> 00:25:36.992
That's a Wednesday.

335
00:25:37.825 --> 00:25:39.825
All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?

336
00:25:40.533 --> 00:25:42.575
Okay, and we'll need
a daytime phone number.

337
00:25:44.658 --> 00:25:47.325
Great. Have a nice day.
See you then.

338
00:25:47.492 --> 00:25:49.200
May I help you?

339
00:25:49.367 --> 00:25:51.825
- I'm Joel Barish.
- Excuse me?

340
00:25:52.575 --> 00:25:55.908
I'm Joel. Barish.
I have an appointment with Dr.--

341
00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:57.742
Mierzwiak.

342
00:25:58.325 --> 00:26:01.242
- Here. Could you please fill this out?
- I just want to talk to him.

343
00:26:01.408 --> 00:26:02.617
You still need to fill the form out, sir.

344
00:26:02.783 --> 00:26:03.533
Really?

345
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.283
- Thank you.
- Great.

346
00:26:07.325 --> 00:26:09.575
- I don't have a pen.
- There's a pen right there.

347
00:26:11.908 --> 00:26:13.908
- Good morning. Lacuna.
- Oh.

348
00:26:14.075 --> 00:26:17.575
Oh, yeah, that offer. That's done
now. That expired after the New Year.

349
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.075
Mr. Barish?

350
00:26:22.242 --> 00:26:23.867
How are we today?

351
00:26:24.033 --> 00:26:25.908
Not too good, actually.

352
00:26:26.325 --> 00:26:28.367
- Boo!
- Oh, my God! Stan!

353
00:26:28.533 --> 00:26:31.158
- Sorry. Sorry, I was just--
- I'm working!

354
00:26:31.325 --> 00:26:34.200
Sorry. Sorry.

355
00:26:34.617 --> 00:26:36.533
- Here, Doctor.
- Thank you.

356
00:26:37.658 --> 00:26:39.200
You should not have seen this.

357
00:26:39.367 --> 00:26:40.742
I apologize.

358
00:26:45.783 --> 00:26:47.825
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem--

359
00:26:47.992 --> 00:26:49.992
- I assure you, no.
- No.

360
00:26:56.075 --> 00:26:58.658
Mm-mmm. There's no such thing as this.

361
00:27:00.533 --> 00:27:03.700
Look, our files
are confidential, Mr. Barish,

362
00:27:03.867 --> 00:27:05.908
so I can't show you evidence.

363
00:27:06.242 --> 00:27:11.825
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh--
Miss Kruczynski was not happy,

364
00:27:11.992 --> 00:27:13.700
and she wanted to move on.

365
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:16.825
<i>We provide that possibility.</i>

366
00:27:16.992 --> 00:27:17.992
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy..."

367
00:27:18.158 --> 00:27:20.158
"...and wanted to move on.

368
00:27:20.617 --> 00:27:22.908
We provide
that possibility."

369
00:27:23.658 --> 00:27:24.783
What the hell is that?

370
00:27:25.742 --> 00:27:27.575
Nicest guy
she ever went out with.

371
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:29.408
Ow! Fuck!

372
00:27:30.408 --> 00:27:32.658
God, Rob! Give it a rest!

373
00:27:32.825 --> 00:27:34.283
It's okay.
It's all right.

374
00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:36.908
Carrie, I am making
a birdhouse.

375
00:27:39.783 --> 00:27:42.700
What can I say, Joel?
You know Clementine. She's like that.

376
00:27:42.908 --> 00:27:44.825
She's impulsive.

377
00:27:45.242 --> 00:27:48.158
She decided to erase you
almost as a lark.

378
00:27:52.367 --> 00:27:53.950
A lark.

379
00:27:54.367 --> 00:27:57.658
Why? Why? Why?
Why did you do that?

380
00:27:57.825 --> 00:28:00.992
I love you!

381
00:28:01.158 --> 00:28:02.783
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

382
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:05.325
I'm sorry, Doctor.
He just barged right in here.

383
00:28:05.492 --> 00:28:06.700
Okay. I want it done.

384
00:28:06.867 --> 00:28:09.033
I told him pre-Valentine's Day
is our busy time.

385
00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.450
- Oh, th-th-that's--that's okay, Mary.
- But there are people waiting.

386
00:28:12.617 --> 00:28:15.242
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh--
to come inside.

387
00:28:15.408 --> 00:28:16.825
And, Mary, if you could
take care of Mrs. Woo.

388
00:28:16.992 --> 00:28:18.950
- Yes, of course.
- Good-bye, Mrs. Woo.

389
00:28:23.117 --> 00:28:24.867
Now, the, uh--

390
00:28:26.492 --> 00:28:28.825
The first thing
we need you to do, Mr. Barish,

391
00:28:28.992 --> 00:28:30.700
<i>is to go home</i>

392
00:28:30.867 --> 00:28:32.950
<i>and collect
everything you own</i>

393
00:28:33.117 --> 00:28:35.783
<i>that has some association
with Clementine.</i>

394
00:28:36.742 --> 00:28:38.033
<i>Anything.</i>

395
00:28:40.492 --> 00:28:41.992
<i>We'll use these items</i>

396
00:28:42.158 --> 00:28:46.367
<i>to create a map of Clementine
in your brain, okay?</i>

397
00:28:46.533 --> 00:28:48.617
<i>So we'll need, uh</i>--

398
00:28:49.367 --> 00:28:52.117
<i>Uh, photos, clothing, gifts,</i>

399
00:28:52.283 --> 00:28:54.408
<i>books she may have bought you,</i>

400
00:28:54.575 --> 00:28:57.075
<i>CDs you may have
bought together,</i>

401
00:28:57.367 --> 00:28:58.867
<i>journal entries.</i>

402
00:28:59.533 --> 00:29:01.408
<i>We want to empty your home...</i>

403
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:05.492
<i>We want to empty your life
of Clementine.</i>

404
00:29:05.658 --> 00:29:07.658
<i>And after the mapping is done,</i>

405
00:29:07.825 --> 00:29:10.700
<i>our technicians will do the erasing
in your home tonight.</i>

406
00:29:10.867 --> 00:29:14.075
<i>That way, when you awake
in the morning,</i>

407
00:29:14.242 --> 00:29:16.700
<i>you'll find yourself
in your own bed,</i>

408
00:29:16.867 --> 00:29:18.783
<i>as if nothing had happened,</i>

409
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:21.075
<i>a new life awaiting you.</i>

410
00:29:25.492 --> 00:29:27.450
Wake up, buddy!

411
00:29:32.742 --> 00:29:34.867
No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.

412
00:29:35.033 --> 00:29:37.992
You can't have the procedure done
three times in one month.

413
00:29:39.408 --> 00:29:42.575
Well, it's just not our policy here.
How are you today, Mr. Barish?

414
00:29:43.992 --> 00:29:45.200
Hello. I'm right here.

415
00:29:46.492 --> 00:29:48.742
I know it's an emergency,
and we'll do everything we can--

416
00:29:48.908 --> 00:29:50.533
We can fit you in
on the first of March.

417
00:29:50.783 --> 00:29:53.492
Maybe you could
talk to the doctor, a-and he--

418
00:29:54.783 --> 00:29:56.533
All right,
so let's make an appointment.

419
00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.367
What day would you like
to come in this week?

420
00:29:58.533 --> 00:30:01.908
- Mr. Barish.
- Um, he's really busy this afternoon.

421
00:30:02.492 --> 00:30:05.950
Maybe tomorrow would be better.
Around 12:15? Can you do that?

422
00:30:07.033 --> 00:30:10.033
February is very busy for us
because of Valentine's Day.

423
00:30:16.742 --> 00:30:19.033
This is, uh, Stan Fink,

424
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.992
one of our most experienced
and skilled technicians.

425
00:30:23.575 --> 00:30:25.700
He'll be handling
your case tonight.

426
00:30:25.867 --> 00:30:27.658
Great to meet you,
Mr. Barish.

427
00:30:28.867 --> 00:30:30.533
My name is Joel Barish,

428
00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:34.617
and I'm here to erase
Clementine Kruczynski.

429
00:30:35.617 --> 00:30:39.825
Very good. Now, tell me about,
uh, Clementine.

430
00:30:39.992 --> 00:30:41.950
Uh, I was...

431
00:30:43.325 --> 00:30:46.867
living with this woman,
Naomi,

432
00:30:47.033 --> 00:30:49.742
uh, a couple years ago,

433
00:30:49.908 --> 00:30:53.492
and my friends Rob and Carrie
invited us to this party at the beach--

434
00:30:53.658 --> 00:30:54.950
<i>I don't like parties.</i>

435
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.200
<i>Naomi couldn't go,
but I went...</i>

436
00:30:58.367 --> 00:31:01.367
<i>and I, uh, met Clementine.</i>

437
00:31:01.533 --> 00:31:04.492
I'm sorry.

438
00:31:04.658 --> 00:31:07.700
Let's start with
your most recent memories

439
00:31:07.867 --> 00:31:10.658
and work backwards from there,
more or less.

440
00:31:11.575 --> 00:31:14.200
There's an emotional core
to each of our memories,

441
00:31:14.367 --> 00:31:16.617
and when you eradicate
that core,

442
00:31:16.783 --> 00:31:19.658
it starts its degradation process.

443
00:31:19.825 --> 00:31:21.617
By the time you wake up
in the morning,

444
00:31:21.783 --> 00:31:25.158
all the memories we've targeted
will have withered and disappeared,

445
00:31:25.325 --> 00:31:27.325
as in a dream upon waking.

446
00:31:28.117 --> 00:31:30.700
Is there any risk
of brain damage?

447
00:31:30.867 --> 00:31:33.783
Well, uh, technically speaking,

448
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:35.742
the procedure is brain damage,

449
00:31:35.908 --> 00:31:39.033
but it's on a par
with a night of heavy drinking.

450
00:31:39.742 --> 00:31:40.783
Nothing you'll miss.

451
00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:43.867
Comfortable?

452
00:31:44.825 --> 00:31:46.575
What we're doing here,
Mr. Barish,

453
00:31:46.742 --> 00:31:49.367
is actually creating
a map of your brain.

454
00:31:49.533 --> 00:31:51.450
Okay, let's get started.

455
00:31:51.617 --> 00:31:54.825
If we want to get this procedure under way
tonight, we have some work to do.

456
00:31:55.367 --> 00:31:58.950
I want you to react to these objects,
Mr. Barish, if you will.

457
00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:03.617
There's a good story
behind this one--

458
00:32:03.783 --> 00:32:07.158
Uh, actually, Mr. Barish, I'll get
a much better emotional readout

459
00:32:07.325 --> 00:32:11.158
if you refrain from any sort of
verbal description of the items.

460
00:32:11.325 --> 00:32:12.908
Just please try to focus
on the memories.

461
00:32:13.325 --> 00:32:14.783
Oh. Sorry. Okay.

462
00:32:17.492 --> 00:32:21.450
Healthy activity up there.
Healthy readouts. Very good.

463
00:32:22.158 --> 00:32:24.533
- Here's another object.
<i>- That's so</i>--

464
00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.575
Next item. Okay.

465
00:32:29.658 --> 00:32:31.408
Potato head.

466
00:32:31.575 --> 00:32:34.867
Next item. Okay.

467
00:32:35.033 --> 00:32:39.617
<i>Just focus on the memories.
Patrick, do me a favor.</i>

468
00:32:40.658 --> 00:32:42.033
Hey, Patrick, do me a favor,
will ya?

469
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.117
Yeah.

470
00:32:43.283 --> 00:32:45.450
Can you, uh, check
the voltage regulator?

471
00:32:45.617 --> 00:32:47.242
- Uh...
- What do we got there?

472
00:32:47.408 --> 00:32:49.450
- Voltage looks fine.
- Really?

473
00:32:49.617 --> 00:32:52.908
Well, I'm not wiping as clean
as I like here. I'm--

474
00:32:56.325 --> 00:33:00.950
<i>Well, uh, technically,
the procedure is brain damage.</i>

475
00:33:03.367 --> 00:33:05.658
Check the, uh--
Check the connections, please.

476
00:33:07.408 --> 00:33:10.200
Oh, there you are. I--

477
00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:19.450
Why am I--I don't understand
what I'm looking at.

478
00:33:19.617 --> 00:33:22.283
Why am I
standing here and--

479
00:33:22.908 --> 00:33:24.700
Oh, my God.
Déjà vu.

480
00:33:25.408 --> 00:33:28.075
Déjà vu.
This is so--

481
00:33:28.242 --> 00:33:30.825
All right, we should get started.
If we're gonna get the procedure--

482
00:33:30.992 --> 00:33:33.367
...under way tonight,
we have some work to do.

483
00:33:33.825 --> 00:33:36.075
I'm in my head already, aren't I?

484
00:33:36.242 --> 00:33:39.658
I suppose so.
Uh, this is about right.

485
00:33:39.825 --> 00:33:42.325
This is what it--
This is what it would look like.

486
00:33:45.075 --> 00:33:46.492
Very good.

487
00:33:47.075 --> 00:33:49.533
We'll dispose of these mementos
when we're done here.

488
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:53.450
That way you won't be confused later by
their unexplainable presence in your home.

489
00:33:53.617 --> 00:33:54.992
Ah, there we go.

490
00:33:55.158 --> 00:33:56.700
- Patrick?
- Yeah?

491
00:33:56.867 --> 00:33:59.242
- <i>Patrick, can you</i> check--
- Patrick?

492
00:33:59.617 --> 00:34:01.283
- <i>I'm getting some sort of</i>--
- Patrick?

493
00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:02.908
- <i>...readout of my own voice.</i>
- Patrick?

494
00:34:03.117 --> 00:34:06.367
- Why are there so many wires?
<i>- A lot of equipment.</i>

495
00:34:07.117 --> 00:34:08.742
- Does that help?
<i>- Are you sure</i>

496
00:34:08.908 --> 00:34:10.575
<i>you set that thing up properly?</i>

497
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:12.992
- <i>How's that?</i>
<i>- How are you today, Mr. Barish?</i>

498
00:34:13.158 --> 00:34:14.908
- There we are, <i>Mr.</i> Barish.
<i>- All right. That's better.</i>

499
00:34:15.075 --> 00:34:18.158
- I don't know if I like this.
- Think I might try this then.

500
00:34:18.825 --> 00:34:20.408
We're almost done now.

501
00:34:20.575 --> 00:34:22.825
Mmm. Journal.
That will be invaluable.

502
00:34:24.325 --> 00:34:26.867
<i>"I met someone tonight.
I met someone tonight.</i>

503
00:34:27.117 --> 00:34:29.408
<i>I don't know what to do. Her name
is Clementine, and she's amazing."</i>

504
00:34:30.117 --> 00:34:31.825
Whoa, whoa! Jesus!

505
00:34:31.992 --> 00:34:33.783
- What? What?
- Come on! Careful!

506
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:35.408
- What? What?
- Step back!

507
00:34:35.867 --> 00:34:37.783
Just take it easy.

508
00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:39.367
That's fine.

509
00:34:39.533 --> 00:34:42.408
Let's not roach the guy.

510
00:34:45.575 --> 00:34:47.158
All right,
we got that one.

511
00:34:47.325 --> 00:34:49.367
This place is sort of a dump,
don't you think?

512
00:34:49.533 --> 00:34:50.825
It's an apartment,
Patrick.

513
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:53.408
Patrick.

514
00:34:53.575 --> 00:34:57.200
Well, not a dump then,
but sorta plain. Uninspired.

515
00:34:57.992 --> 00:35:00.033
And there's sort of
a stale smell.

516
00:35:01.117 --> 00:35:04.825
Patrick, can we just please
get through this?

517
00:35:04.992 --> 00:35:07.117
- We got a very long night ahead of us.
- Yeah.

518
00:35:07.283 --> 00:35:08.283
Come on.

519
00:35:13.325 --> 00:35:15.658
<i>This is the last time I saw you.</i>

520
00:35:31.617 --> 00:35:33.117
It's 3:00.

521
00:35:33.283 --> 00:35:37.742
I kinda sorta
wrecked your car.

522
00:35:37.908 --> 00:35:39.825
Were you driving drunk?

523
00:35:39.992 --> 00:35:41.450
It's pathetic.

524
00:35:42.325 --> 00:35:44.700
I was a little tipsy.

525
00:35:44.867 --> 00:35:46.492
Don't call me pathetic.

526
00:35:46.658 --> 00:35:49.492
Well, it is pathetic.
It's fucking irresponsible.

527
00:35:49.658 --> 00:35:51.283
- Could've killed somebody.
- Oh, God.

528
00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:53.825
I don't know. Maybe you did kill somebody.
Should we turn on the news and see?

529
00:35:53.992 --> 00:35:55.742
Oh, Christ!

530
00:35:55.908 --> 00:35:58.075
Should I check the grill to see
if there's children or small animals?

531
00:35:58.242 --> 00:35:59.867
I didn't kill anybody!
It's just a fucking dent, Joel.

532
00:36:00.033 --> 00:36:01.408
God, you're like an old lady or something.

533
00:36:01.575 --> 00:36:06.117
- What are you like? A wino?
- A wino?

534
00:36:06.283 --> 00:36:09.075
Jesus, are you from the '50s
or something?

535
00:36:09.242 --> 00:36:10.575
A wino?

536
00:36:11.867 --> 00:36:13.408
Face it, Joely.

537
00:36:13.575 --> 00:36:17.992
You're freaked out because
I was out late without you,

538
00:36:18.158 --> 00:36:20.908
and in your little
wormy brain,

539
00:36:21.075 --> 00:36:24.867
you're trying to figure out,
did she fuck someone tonight?

540
00:36:26.492 --> 00:36:28.242
No, see, Clem,

541
00:36:28.408 --> 00:36:30.325
I assume you fucked
someone tonight.

542
00:36:31.367 --> 00:36:33.450
Isn't that how you get people to like you?

543
00:36:43.492 --> 00:36:46.867
I'm sorry. Okay?

544
00:36:47.033 --> 00:36:49.783
Clem, I didn't mean it.
All right?

545
00:36:55.117 --> 00:36:56.742
- Clem?
- Your keys.

546
00:36:56.908 --> 00:36:58.367
- I was just--
- I won't need them anymore.

547
00:36:58.533 --> 00:37:00.700
I was just--

548
00:37:00.867 --> 00:37:03.575
Angry or annoyed or something,
I don't know.

549
00:37:10.742 --> 00:37:12.117
Clem?

550
00:37:14.533 --> 00:37:16.033
Got it.

551
00:37:17.408 --> 00:37:19.200
Mary's coming over tonight.

552
00:37:19.367 --> 00:37:20.742
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

553
00:37:20.908 --> 00:37:22.367
Just thought
you'd wanna know.

554
00:37:22.533 --> 00:37:24.825
I like Mary. I like
when she comes to visit.

555
00:37:24.992 --> 00:37:27.492
- I just don't think she likes me.
- She likes you okay.

556
00:37:28.783 --> 00:37:32.242
So, maybe I should invite my girlfriend
over. I have a girlfriend now.

557
00:37:32.408 --> 00:37:34.617
- Do whatever you want.
- Did I tell you I have--

558
00:37:34.783 --> 00:37:36.325
- Hey, uh--
- Yeah.

559
00:37:41.575 --> 00:37:43.575
Did I tell you
I have a new girlfriend?

560
00:37:43.742 --> 00:37:46.117
We gotta focus here,
Patrick.

561
00:37:46.283 --> 00:37:47.908
Yeah, the thing is,

562
00:37:48.075 --> 00:37:51.325
our situation is--
is a little weird.

563
00:37:51.992 --> 00:37:53.492
My girlfriend situation.

564
00:37:53.825 --> 00:37:55.408
I'm sure it is.

565
00:37:56.325 --> 00:37:57.325
You gotta be--

566
00:38:23.783 --> 00:38:25.450
Clem, let me
drive you home.

567
00:38:25.617 --> 00:38:27.783
Get out of my face, faggot!

568
00:38:29.408 --> 00:38:32.575
Look at it out here!
It's all falling apart!

569
00:38:32.742 --> 00:38:34.742
I'm erasing you,
and I'm happy!

570
00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:37.408
You did it to me first!

571
00:38:37.575 --> 00:38:40.867
I can't believe you did this to me.
Goddamn it.

572
00:38:41.533 --> 00:38:43.575
Clem! Can you hear me?

573
00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:46.325
By morning you'll be gone!

574
00:38:47.075 --> 00:38:50.200
The perfect ending
to this piece-of-shit story!

575
00:38:56.033 --> 00:38:58.575
<i>ls there something wrong with
a girl being attracted to me?</i>

576
00:38:58.742 --> 00:39:02.075
<i>- Is that a problem?</i>
<i>- No, I think it's...funny.</i>

577
00:39:02.242 --> 00:39:05.117
<i>So, who do you think's
better-looking, me or this guy?</i>

578
00:39:05.283 --> 00:39:07.367
<i>Patrick, let's focus, buddy.</i>

579
00:39:07.533 --> 00:39:09.700
<i>Remember that girl
we did last week?</i>

580
00:39:09.867 --> 00:39:12.450
<i>The one with the...potatoes?</i>

581
00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:18.700
<i>That girl?
Yeah, that--that's this guy's girl.</i>

582
00:39:18.867 --> 00:39:20.283
- <i>Right.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

583
00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:23.075
<i>Was. We took care of that.</i>

584
00:39:23.242 --> 00:39:24.742
Oh, come on!

585
00:39:24.908 --> 00:39:28.492
Well, uh, I kinda
fell in love with her that night.

586
00:39:28.658 --> 00:39:31.492
What? You little fuck--

587
00:39:31.658 --> 00:39:34.575
- What?
- She was unconscious, man.

588
00:39:35.117 --> 00:39:37.492
Well, she was beautiful, and--

589
00:39:38.867 --> 00:39:40.617
I stole a pair
of her panties as well.

590
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:45.617
- Jesus!
- What?

591
00:39:45.783 --> 00:39:48.200
It's not like--
I mean, they were clean and all.

592
00:39:48.367 --> 00:39:50.533
Don't tell me this stuff, man!
I don't wanna hear this shit!

593
00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:53.325
- <i>They were clean!</i>
<i>- What? D-Don't! Stop!</i>

594
00:39:53.492 --> 00:39:55.242
- <i>Okay. Yeah! All right!</i>
- We <i>got work to do.</i>

595
00:39:55.408 --> 00:39:56.825
<i>Okay. Fine.</i>

596
00:39:56.992 --> 00:39:58.408
<i>Give me my papers.</i>

597
00:40:11.867 --> 00:40:13.575
<i>There's, um</i>--

598
00:40:14.742 --> 00:40:16.242
There's more.

599
00:40:18.742 --> 00:40:20.408
After we did her,
I kind of...

600
00:40:21.408 --> 00:40:24.325
<i>went to where she works
and asked her out.</i>

601
00:40:25.908 --> 00:40:27.033
<i>You what?</i>

602
00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:30.700
- Jesus.
<i>- Jesus, Patrick!</i>

603
00:40:31.617 --> 00:40:34.533
<i>Do you have...any idea...</i>

604
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:36.158
how unethical--

605
00:40:36.325 --> 00:40:38.617
It's not really that bad.

606
00:40:38.783 --> 00:40:42.408
What? What? Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?

607
00:40:42.575 --> 00:40:45.617
<i>Patrick, you stole a girl's panties!</i>

608
00:40:57.325 --> 00:40:58.908
There's someone here.

609
00:41:00.867 --> 00:41:01.992
He stole your underwear.

610
00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.492
I don't see anyone.

611
00:41:22.367 --> 00:41:24.658
Joel?

612
00:41:25.283 --> 00:41:26.408
Where are my boots?

613
00:41:27.033 --> 00:41:30.700
<i>Why are you showing me
poisons? Can't you understand English?</i>

614
00:41:30.867 --> 00:41:33.617
<i>"Potions, ' I said.
Potions.</i>

615
00:41:40.367 --> 00:41:42.200
<i>Love potion, please.</i>

616
00:41:42.367 --> 00:41:45.867
I'm fucking crawling
out of my skin!

617
00:41:48.367 --> 00:41:50.242
Should've left you
at the flea market.

618
00:41:52.617 --> 00:41:54.533
<i>First thing to do is</i>

619
00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:58.117
<i>sift in a cup
of powdered whale heart.</i>

620
00:42:04.242 --> 00:42:05.450
Wanna go?

621
00:42:06.825 --> 00:42:08.742
I want to have a baby.

622
00:42:08.908 --> 00:42:11.742
Let's talk about it later.

623
00:42:12.075 --> 00:42:14.658
No! I want to have a baby.

624
00:42:16.283 --> 00:42:17.783
I don't think
we're ready.

625
00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.575
You're not ready.

626
00:42:22.075 --> 00:42:24.408
Clem, do you really think
you could take care of a kid?

627
00:42:25.158 --> 00:42:26.783
What?

628
00:42:28.992 --> 00:42:30.408
I don't wanna talk about it here.

629
00:42:30.575 --> 00:42:33.617
I can't hear you. I can never the fuck
understand what you're saying.

630
00:42:33.783 --> 00:42:35.908
- I don't wanna talk about this!
- Fucking ventriloquist!

631
00:42:36.075 --> 00:42:38.492
- We're fucking gonna talk about it!
- I...don't...want...to--

632
00:42:38.658 --> 00:42:41.283
You can't just say something like that
and say you don't wanna talk about it!

633
00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:43.658
- I'm sorry, Clem.
- I'd make a fucking good mother!

634
00:42:43.825 --> 00:42:46.075
I love children,
I'm creative and smart,

635
00:42:46.242 --> 00:42:49.117
- and I'd make a fucking great mother!
- Oh, God--Mmm!

636
00:42:49.283 --> 00:42:52.325
It's you, Joel. It's you
who can't commit to anything!

637
00:42:52.492 --> 00:42:53.492
It's going! It's going!

638
00:42:53.658 --> 00:42:54.825
You have no idea how lucky you
are I'm interested in you!

639
00:42:54.992 --> 00:42:55.867
I don't even know why I am.

640
00:42:56.033 --> 00:42:58.450
Maybe I should end this
right here, Joel!

641
00:42:58.617 --> 00:42:59.825
- Leave you at the flea market--
- It's done.

642
00:42:59.992 --> 00:43:02.408
- ...with stupid costume jewelry!
- This is crap.

643
00:43:02.575 --> 00:43:05.033
Maybe you could find yourself
a nice antique rocking chair to die in!

644
00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.950
All the pain, confusion--

645
00:43:14.408 --> 00:43:16.450
- Oh. Hi, Patrick.
- Hi, Mary. How's it goin'?

646
00:43:16.617 --> 00:43:18.617
- Hey, you.
- Oh, it's freezing outside.

647
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.200
- Find us okay?
- Yeah.

648
00:43:24.783 --> 00:43:26.992
- Mmm.
- Hot!

649
00:43:29.283 --> 00:43:30.283
Poor guy.

650
00:43:30.533 --> 00:43:32.700
Mmm? Oh.

651
00:43:33.825 --> 00:43:35.367
Don't you have
anything real to drink?

652
00:43:35.533 --> 00:43:38.325
Uh, we haven't really
checked yet.

653
00:43:38.492 --> 00:43:39.617
- Oh.
- Patrick?

654
00:43:39.783 --> 00:43:41.950
- Uh, yeah.
- Uh, let me do the honors.

655
00:43:44.283 --> 00:43:45.867
Mary hates me.

656
00:43:46.492 --> 00:43:48.367
Never really had much luck
with the ladies.

657
00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:50.950
Maybe if you stop
stealing their panties.

658
00:43:51.117 --> 00:43:53.908
Stan. Stan.

659
00:43:54.075 --> 00:43:55.033
- There's more.
- No!

660
00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.908
- Yes.
- No!

661
00:43:57.492 --> 00:44:00.825
Hey, hey!

662
00:44:00.992 --> 00:44:03.117
Oh, you didn't want any,
did you, Patrick?

663
00:44:03.283 --> 00:44:06.325
- Uh, no, that's okay.
- Wait.

664
00:44:06.908 --> 00:44:10.700
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get
the better even of their blunders."

665
00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:14.617
Oh.

666
00:44:14.783 --> 00:44:16.325
- Oh!
- Oh!

667
00:44:16.492 --> 00:44:19.575
Mmm!

668
00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:25.117
That's Nietzsche.
<i>Beyond Good and Evil.</i>

669
00:44:25.283 --> 00:44:27.408
I found it
in my <i>Bartlett's.</i>

670
00:44:27.575 --> 00:44:28.950
What's your <i>Bartlett's?</i>

671
00:44:29.783 --> 00:44:33.492
It's a quote book, Patrick.
It's a book of quotations.

672
00:44:33.658 --> 00:44:36.033
I think Howard will be
in <i>Bartlett's</i> one day.

673
00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.950
Definitely.
Howard is pure <i>Bartlett's.</i>

674
00:44:38.117 --> 00:44:40.450
God!

675
00:44:40.617 --> 00:44:43.033
Can you wake him up?

676
00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.908
You can't wake him up.

677
00:44:48.242 --> 00:44:49.617
Mmm.

678
00:44:54.117 --> 00:44:55.908
You don't tell me
things, Joel.

679
00:44:58.158 --> 00:44:59.992
I'm an open book.

680
00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:03.242
I tell you everything.

681
00:45:03.408 --> 00:45:06.242
Every damn
embarrassing thing.

682
00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:10.700
You don't trust me.

683
00:45:11.492 --> 00:45:14.575
Constantly talking isn't
necessarily communicating.

684
00:45:17.367 --> 00:45:18.867
I don't do that.

685
00:45:21.867 --> 00:45:23.700
I want to know you.

686
00:45:25.117 --> 00:45:26.617
Hmm?

687
00:45:26.783 --> 00:45:30.075
I don't constantly talk.
Jesus!

688
00:45:31.867 --> 00:45:34.200
People have to
share things, Joel.

689
00:45:34.367 --> 00:45:35.867
Mm-hmm.

690
00:45:36.033 --> 00:45:38.075
That's what intimacy is.

691
00:45:38.992 --> 00:45:41.117
I'm really pissed
that you said that to me.

692
00:45:41.283 --> 00:45:42.992
I'm sorry.

693
00:45:43.158 --> 00:45:45.783
It just--really just
isn't that interesting.

694
00:45:47.617 --> 00:45:50.658
<i>I wanna read some of those
journals you're constantly scribbling in.</i>

695
00:45:50.825 --> 00:45:55.242
<i>What do you write in there if you don't
have any thoughts or passions or...love?</i>

696
00:46:02.658 --> 00:46:06.658
<i>November 19, 2003.</i>

697
00:46:07.575 --> 00:46:09.867
<i>Dinner at Kang's again.</i>

698
00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:14.575
<i>Are we like
those poor couples...</i>

699
00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:17.742
<i>you feel sorry for
in restaurants?</i>

700
00:46:18.492 --> 00:46:20.158
<i>Are we the dining dead?</i>

701
00:46:21.075 --> 00:46:24.658
I can't stand the idea of us being
a couple people think that about.

702
00:46:29.492 --> 00:46:30.908
I like that.

703
00:46:34.242 --> 00:46:35.242
How's the chicken?

704
00:46:36.492 --> 00:46:37.575
Good.

705
00:46:39.492 --> 00:46:41.658
- More?
- No. No. Thank you.

706
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:47.617
<i>She's gonna be drunk
and stupid now.</i>

707
00:46:47.783 --> 00:46:49.783
Hey, would you do me a favor

708
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:52.658
and clean the goddamn hair off the soap
when you're done in the shower?

709
00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:55.117
- Yeah. Oh. Yeah.
- It's really---

710
00:46:55.283 --> 00:46:56.575
- Gross.
- Gross.

711
00:46:59.283 --> 00:47:01.533
- It's just--
- Repulsive.

712
00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.200
It's repulsive.

713
00:47:09.367 --> 00:47:11.658
Patrick, can we get through this?

714
00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:13.117
Patrick.

715
00:47:13.367 --> 00:47:14.825
<i>Hey, Tangerine.</i>

716
00:47:15.575 --> 00:47:17.825
<i>Oh, Patrick, it's you.</i>

717
00:47:18.617 --> 00:47:20.992
<i>I'm so miserable right now.</i>

718
00:47:21.742 --> 00:47:23.742
- <i>Why? What's wrong?</i>
<i>- I don't know.</i>

719
00:47:23.908 --> 00:47:25.950
- Excuse me?
<i>- I'm so confused!</i>

720
00:47:26.742 --> 00:47:28.200
Can I help you
find something, sir?

721
00:47:28.367 --> 00:47:31.325
<i>Confused? What are you
confused about? Everything's fine.</i>

722
00:47:32.158 --> 00:47:34.075
Baby, come here.

723
00:47:34.242 --> 00:47:35.533
<i>Scared of what?</i>

724
00:47:36.783 --> 00:47:38.200
<i>I don't know.</i>

725
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:42.867
<i>- Do you love me?</i>
<i>- Of course I do.</i>

726
00:47:43.033 --> 00:47:44.825
Where's the self-help section?

727
00:47:44.992 --> 00:47:47.242
<i>Do you think I'm ugly?</i>

728
00:47:47.408 --> 00:47:49.617
<i>No! You're beautiful!</i>

729
00:47:49.783 --> 00:47:52.075
- <i>Maybe I should come over.</i>
<i>- No, no.</i>

730
00:47:52.242 --> 00:47:56.242
<i>I don't know. I-I'm a mess, Patrick.
You know.</i>

731
00:47:56.408 --> 00:47:58.408
<i>Well, just let me come over.
I'll</i> cheer <i>you up.</i>

732
00:47:58.575 --> 00:47:59.950
<i>Okay.</i>

733
00:48:00.117 --> 00:48:03.242
Stan, can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.

734
00:48:03.408 --> 00:48:06.408
Patrick, we're right in the middle
of erasing this poor man's--

735
00:48:06.575 --> 00:48:09.408
Let him go, Stan!
Let him go. I'll help.

736
00:48:10.783 --> 00:48:12.533
- See?
- How hard can it be?

737
00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:15.325
- She hates me. She wants me to go.
- Go.

738
00:48:16.367 --> 00:48:18.992
All right.
I'll be right over, Tangerine.

739
00:48:19.367 --> 00:48:20.867
You like?

740
00:48:21.033 --> 00:48:24.158
Oh, man!

741
00:48:24.325 --> 00:48:25.992
I matched my sweatshirt
exactly.

742
00:48:26.158 --> 00:48:27.908
- I like it.
- You do?

743
00:48:28.075 --> 00:48:30.367
- You look like a tangerine.
- Oh!

744
00:48:30.533 --> 00:48:33.867
- "Clemen-teen" the tangerine.
- Mmm! Juicy!

745
00:48:34.033 --> 00:48:36.617
- And seedless.
- I like that.

746
00:48:38.408 --> 00:48:41.117
I like tangerines!

747
00:48:41.283 --> 00:48:43.575
- Can you see me doing ducks?
- Tangerine.

748
00:48:43.742 --> 00:48:45.783
Joel. Ducks.

749
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:48.575
- How does he know to call you that?
- How did who know?

750
00:48:48.742 --> 00:48:51.367
- Oh, my God. Clem?
<i>- This is pretty cool.</i>

751
00:48:51.533 --> 00:48:52.950
That's what
they called themselves.

752
00:48:53.117 --> 00:48:55.575
The Clash,
the only band that mattered.

753
00:48:55.742 --> 00:48:57.533
They called themselves that
for a reason.

754
00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:59.242
It's amazing, isn't it?

755
00:48:59.408 --> 00:49:01.617
Like social justice--
Yeah, it's totally incredible.

756
00:49:01.783 --> 00:49:03.950
What Howard
gives to the world.

757
00:49:05.617 --> 00:49:07.408
Yeah.

758
00:49:07.575 --> 00:49:09.575
To let people
begin again.

759
00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:13.283
It's beautiful.

760
00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:18.533
You look at a baby, and it's so pure
and so free and so clean.

761
00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:21.825
And adults are, like,
this mess of sadness

762
00:49:21.992 --> 00:49:24.825
and...phobias.

763
00:49:25.992 --> 00:49:27.825
Howard just makes it
all go away.

764
00:49:37.867 --> 00:49:39.700
Oh, my God.

765
00:49:41.825 --> 00:49:44.950
- Baby, what's going on?
- I don't know. I don't know!

766
00:49:45.117 --> 00:49:48.783
I'm lost. I'm scared.
I feel like I'm disappearing.

767
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:51.575
- Disappearing?
- My skin's coming off! I'm getting old!

768
00:49:51.742 --> 00:49:54.283
- Nothing makes any sense to me!
- You're not getting old.

769
00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:57.075
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense.

770
00:49:57.242 --> 00:50:00.033
- Oh, Tangerine.
- Nothing makes any sense.

771
00:50:00.992 --> 00:50:04.492
- Nothing makes any sense, Patrick.
- It's okay. It's okay.

772
00:50:04.742 --> 00:50:08.575
Hey, let's go out dancing. Yeah?
You wanna go out to Montauk with me?

773
00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:10.367
- Montauk?
- Yeah.

774
00:50:10.533 --> 00:50:12.408
No! Come up
to Boston with me.

775
00:50:12.575 --> 00:50:14.408
Sure. Yeah.
We can go next weekend.

776
00:50:14.575 --> 00:50:17.908
No, no. Now. Now.
Yeah. I have to go now.

777
00:50:18.075 --> 00:50:20.075
I have to see
the frozen Charles now.

778
00:50:24.367 --> 00:50:26.117
<i>Hi, it's Joel.</i>

779
00:50:26.283 --> 00:50:31.617
<i>Um, leave a message after the beep,
and I'll get back to you.</i>

780
00:50:33.575 --> 00:50:35.867
<i>Pick up! Pick up, man!</i>

781
00:50:36.033 --> 00:50:39.492
W-W-Whoa. Hold on,
hold on, hold on.

782
00:50:41.075 --> 00:50:43.742
Hello? Yeah, what's up?

783
00:50:43.908 --> 00:50:46.533
I got into a little situation
with the old lady.

784
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:49.200
Can you handle things tonight alone?
I'm really sorry, man.

785
00:50:49.783 --> 00:50:52.033
Don't worry about it.
I got it under control, man.

786
00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.242
He's pretty much on autopilot
right now anyway.

787
00:50:54.408 --> 00:50:55.783
<i>Thanks, Stan.
I owe you big-time.</i>

788
00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:57.492
Dude, I gotta go.
I gotta go.

789
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:02.325
Charles.

790
00:51:05.117 --> 00:51:06.450
Come on. Charles.

791
00:51:11.367 --> 00:51:13.658
"Look! You and me,
on the Charles River!

792
00:51:14.283 --> 00:51:18.658
I could die right now, Clem. I'm just
happy. I've never felt that before.

793
00:51:18.825 --> 00:51:20.575
I'm just exactly
where I want--"

794
00:51:21.992 --> 00:51:24.992
- I'm so excited. Yay.
- I'm excited too.

795
00:51:25.408 --> 00:51:28.950
- Cool.
- Oh, uh, I, uh--

796
00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:31.242
I got you this--

797
00:51:31.408 --> 00:51:34.408
- What?
- ...thing, um--

798
00:51:34.575 --> 00:51:36.617
Happy early Valentine's Day.

799
00:51:36.783 --> 00:51:38.200
Oh!

800
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:41.950
Wow. What is it?

801
00:51:42.117 --> 00:51:44.575
Uh, I don't know.
Open it up.

802
00:51:49.992 --> 00:51:51.283
Oh.

803
00:51:52.075 --> 00:51:53.867
It--It's gorgeous!

804
00:51:54.033 --> 00:51:57.033
- You like it?
- Yeah. It's just my taste. Really.

805
00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.867
God, I've never gone out with a guy
who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.

806
00:52:01.992 --> 00:52:03.367
Thank you.

807
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:12.408
- Let's go.
- Okay.

808
00:52:12.575 --> 00:52:15.575
- Joely?
- Yeah, Tangerine?

809
00:52:17.492 --> 00:52:18.908
Am I ugly?

810
00:52:20.158 --> 00:52:22.075
- Mm-mmm.
- When I was a kid,

811
00:52:22.242 --> 00:52:23.492
I thought I was.

812
00:52:23.658 --> 00:52:27.658
Can't believe
I'm crying already.

813
00:52:28.242 --> 00:52:30.658
Sometimes I think people
don't understand

814
00:52:30.825 --> 00:52:33.283
how lonely it is
to be a kid.

815
00:52:33.992 --> 00:52:36.492
Like you don't matter.

816
00:52:36.658 --> 00:52:39.783
<i>So, I'm eight,</i>

817
00:52:40.158 --> 00:52:42.242
<i>and I have these toys,</i>

818
00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:44.408
<i>these dolls.</i>

819
00:52:44.575 --> 00:52:48.825
<i>My favorite is this ugly girl doll
who I call Clementine.</i>

820
00:52:49.575 --> 00:52:51.117
<i>And I keep yelling at her:</i>

821
00:52:51.742 --> 00:52:54.533
"You can't be ugly! Be pretty!"

822
00:52:55.867 --> 00:52:56.908
It's weird.

823
00:52:57.367 --> 00:53:00.200
<i>Like if I can transform her...</i>

824
00:53:00.867 --> 00:53:03.283
<i>I would magically change too.</i>

825
00:53:08.242 --> 00:53:09.658
You're pretty.

826
00:53:09.825 --> 00:53:13.450
Joely, don't ever leave me.

827
00:53:13.617 --> 00:53:17.658
Pretty. Pretty.
Pretty. Pretty.

828
00:53:17.825 --> 00:53:21.283
<i>Mierzwiak, please
let me keep this memory.</i>

829
00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:22.950
<i>Just this one.</i>

830
00:53:23.617 --> 00:53:25.450
I don't wanna hold your hand.
Come on.

831
00:53:26.408 --> 00:53:27.742
- Whoo!
- Whoa!

832
00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.658
Stop it!

833
00:53:33.783 --> 00:53:35.533
I could die right now, Clem.

834
00:53:38.283 --> 00:53:39.617
I'm just...

835
00:53:41.242 --> 00:53:42.658
happy.

836
00:53:45.783 --> 00:53:47.742
I've never felt that before.

837
00:53:49.117 --> 00:53:50.992
Mmm.

838
00:53:51.158 --> 00:53:52.992
I'm just exactly...

839
00:53:55.408 --> 00:53:57.283
where I wanna be.

840
00:53:59.617 --> 00:54:00.617
Clem?

841
00:54:07.283 --> 00:54:08.617
I want to call it off.

842
00:54:09.325 --> 00:54:10.742
I'll give you a sign.

843
00:54:16.408 --> 00:54:17.700
I want to call it off.

844
00:54:20.158 --> 00:54:22.575
Can you hear me?
I don't want this anymore!

845
00:54:22.742 --> 00:54:24.658
I want to call it off!

846
00:54:25.658 --> 00:54:29.408

847
00:54:29.575 --> 00:54:31.242

848
00:54:31.575 --> 00:54:34.408

849
00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:44.158
- Clementine!

850
00:54:44.325 --> 00:54:46.533

Clem.

853

- Clem!
- What?

854
00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:54.450
- We gotta go. We gotta go.
- What? Where?

855
00:54:54.617 --> 00:54:57.075
- I have an idea of how to stop this.
- Stop what?

856

- Joely.
- Come on.

857
00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.533
- <i>No!</i>
<i>- Smell my pits!</i>

858
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.908
<i>No! No! No!
Don't tickle me!</i>

859
00:55:05.075 --> 00:55:07.242
<i>Smell my pits.</i>

860
00:55:07.408 --> 00:55:09.575
No. Come on.
Concentrate, Clem.

861
00:55:11.325 --> 00:55:13.700
- <i>We gotta get back to the office.</i>
<i>- Halloween.</i>

862
00:55:13.867 --> 00:55:16.158
<i>There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.</i>

863
00:55:16.325 --> 00:55:17.992
Not the picture.

864
00:55:18.158 --> 00:55:21.533
Where is it?
Back here. Come on!

865
00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:24.283
<i>Oh, look at me.
Hey, I look good there.</i>

866
00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:27.533
<i>Look, our files
are confidential, Mr. Barish,</i>

867
00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:29.617
<i>so I can't show you evidence.</i>

868
00:55:29.908 --> 00:55:33.450
<i>Suffice it to say that
Miss, uh--Miss Kruczynski</i>

869
00:55:33.617 --> 00:55:36.950
<i>was not happy
and she wanted to move on.</i>

870
00:55:38.283 --> 00:55:40.450
- <i>Good, now, tell me about Clementine.</i>
<i>- Just tell me</i>

871
00:55:40.617 --> 00:55:42.033
<i>everything you remember.</i>

872
00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:44.825
- That's what he said. Then--
- What did we see that day?

873
00:55:44.992 --> 00:55:46.908
- No, wait.
- Oh, look! Hey!

874
00:55:47.075 --> 00:55:49.158
- Shit!
- We're going to see my grandma.

875
00:55:49.783 --> 00:55:51.575
- Joel, what? No, I don't want to--
- We're not going on a train.

876
00:55:51.742 --> 00:55:53.492
Joel, please!
Don't make me run anymore.

877
00:55:53.658 --> 00:55:54.908
Come on!

878
00:55:55.492 --> 00:55:56.992
Mierzwiak!

879
00:55:57.617 --> 00:55:59.908
- Do we always have to run?
- Mierzwiak!

880
00:56:10.242 --> 00:56:11.450
Please.

881
00:56:11.992 --> 00:56:15.158
So, why don't we begin
by you telling me

882
00:56:15.325 --> 00:56:17.367
everything you can remember.

883
00:56:17.533 --> 00:56:19.908
Mierzwiak! Wake me up!

884
00:56:20.075 --> 00:56:23.117
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.

885
00:56:23.283 --> 00:56:26.158
I thought you understood
what was going on here.

886
00:56:26.325 --> 00:56:29.283
I don't know.
You're erasing her from me.

887
00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:31.242
You're erasing me from her--

888
00:56:34.867 --> 00:56:35.950
I don't know.

889
00:56:37.033 --> 00:56:40.450
You've got this thing.
I'm in my bed. I know it.

890
00:56:40.617 --> 00:56:42.575
I'm in my brain.

891
00:56:42.742 --> 00:56:45.492
I'm part of your
imagination too, Joel.

892
00:56:45.658 --> 00:56:48.283
How can I help you
from there?

893
00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:52.283
Uh, I'm inside your head too. I'm you.

894
00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:55.408
Sorry.

895
00:56:55.575 --> 00:56:57.533
Look. Who's that?

896
00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:59.700
Oh, he-he works for us.

897
00:56:59.867 --> 00:57:04.367
That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-a trick,

898
00:57:04.533 --> 00:57:07.075
baby boy.

899
00:57:07.242 --> 00:57:08.617
He's stealing my identity.

900
00:57:09.783 --> 00:57:11.117
He stole my stuff.

901
00:57:12.450 --> 00:57:15.992
He's, uh, seducing my girlfriend
with my words and my things.

902
00:57:16.158 --> 00:57:19.575
He stole her underwear.
Oh, Jesus Christ!

903
00:57:19.742 --> 00:57:21.242
He stole her underwear.

904
00:57:21.408 --> 00:57:24.575
I could die right now, Clem.

905
00:57:24.908 --> 00:57:26.283
I'm just happy.

906
00:57:27.533 --> 00:57:31.325
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want to be.

907
00:57:33.408 --> 00:57:34.450
I want to go home.

908
00:57:36.492 --> 00:57:38.283
Hey. What?

909
00:57:40.908 --> 00:57:43.908
Clem!

910
00:57:44.617 --> 00:57:45.783
Wait. Clem!

911
00:57:48.325 --> 00:57:49.450
Clem?

912
00:57:49.992 --> 00:57:52.325
They're erasing you.

913
00:57:52.492 --> 00:57:54.450
I'm here!

914
00:57:54.617 --> 00:57:57.617
Clem, focus. I hired them, okay?

915
00:57:57.783 --> 00:57:59.158
I'm sorry.
I'm so stupid.

916
00:57:59.325 --> 00:58:02.367
Sweetie, calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.

917
00:58:02.533 --> 00:58:05.492
I need it to stop before I wake up
and I don't know you anymore.

918
00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:11.158
Okay, well, you know,
just tell them to cancel it then.

919
00:58:11.825 --> 00:58:14.742
What the hell are you talking about?
I can't just cancel it. I'm asleep.

920
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:17.033
Wake yourself up!

921
00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:19.533
Okay. You want me to wake up?
Okay. Great. All right.

922
00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:21.367
Okay, here we go.
Will this make you happy if I try?

923
00:58:21.533 --> 00:58:22.533
Yeah.

924
00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:25.408
I'll try really hard. Here we go.
That was a great idea.

925
00:58:25.575 --> 00:58:27.742
Yeah. Okay.

926
00:58:28.992 --> 00:58:31.117
Boy, that's working
like gangbusters.

927
00:58:31.742 --> 00:58:33.658
- Don't! That tickles me!
- Oh, my goodness.

928
00:58:33.825 --> 00:58:36.742
Oh, my God. What is that?
Jesus Christ! What the--

929
00:58:36.908 --> 00:58:38.242
It's a birthmark!

930
00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:43.450
It did work, for a second,

931
00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:46.075
- but I couldn't--
- See?

932
00:58:46.408 --> 00:58:47.367
I couldn't move.

933
00:58:47.658 --> 00:58:52.117
Oh, well, isn't that just another one
of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?

934
00:58:52.283 --> 00:58:54.492
It's more important to prove me wrong
than to actually--

935
00:58:54.658 --> 00:58:56.492
Look, I don't want to
discuss this right now, okay?

936
00:58:57.658 --> 00:58:59.075
Fine.

937
00:59:01.325 --> 00:59:04.367
Then what? I'm listening.

938
00:59:04.533 --> 00:59:06.783
I don't know.
You erased me.

939
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:09.408
That's why I'm here. That's why
I'm doing this in the first place.

940
00:59:09.575 --> 00:59:11.117
I'm sorry.
You--You!

941
00:59:11.283 --> 00:59:12.950
You know me.
I'm impulsive.

942
00:59:17.492 --> 00:59:19.367
That's what I love
about you.

943
00:59:22.742 --> 00:59:24.117
Joel?

944
00:59:24.742 --> 00:59:26.575
- Mm-hmm?
- I have another idea

945
00:59:26.742 --> 00:59:27.783
for this problem.

946
00:59:28.450 --> 00:59:29.867
This is a memory of me,

947
00:59:30.242 --> 00:59:34.992
the way you wanted to have sex on the
couch after you looked down at my crotch.

948
00:59:35.158 --> 00:59:37.992
- What?
- Joel, the eraser guys are coming here,

949
00:59:38.158 --> 00:59:41.117
so what if you take me
somewhere else,

950
00:59:41.283 --> 00:59:44.658
somewhere where I don't belong,
and we hide there till morning?

951
00:59:50.533 --> 00:59:53.742
Oh, man. I can't remember
anything without you.

952
00:59:53.908 --> 00:59:57.033
Tsk, that's very sweet,
but try, okay?

953
00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:58.242
Okay.

Joel?

Joel?

967
01:00:55.367 --> 01:00:56.783
<i>Where'd you go?</i>

968
01:00:57.617 --> 01:00:59.408
I'm supposed to come too!

969
01:00:59.575 --> 01:01:00.908
Listen,
I'm just gonna go get a salad bowl.

970
01:01:01.075 --> 01:01:03.033
Can you stir the soup and
can you keep an eye on Joel?

971
01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.908
- Sure.
- He just likes to be near me.

972
01:01:05.075 --> 01:01:07.033
- Absolutely!
- Clem?

973
01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:11.283
It worked.
My God, look at this! Wow!

974
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:15.575
It worked! Look!
Look at this dress, man!

975
01:01:15.742 --> 01:01:18.617
Oh, my God! Look at it!
I wish I could take it with me.

976
01:01:21.117 --> 01:01:22.075
Who am I?

977
01:01:22.242 --> 01:01:24.533
- Mrs. Hamlyn.
- Right. Mrs. Hamlyn.

978
01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:27.283
I must be about four.
Oh, my gosh.

979
01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:30.617
Found the salad bowl,
so I'm serving salad and string beans.

980
01:01:30.783 --> 01:01:32.658
Is he okay under there?
Peanut, are you all right?

981
01:01:32.825 --> 01:01:36.033
God, honestly, I feel like
I could clean up all day.

982
01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.742
Listen, would you hate me if I asked you
to clean some string beans?

983
01:01:38.908 --> 01:01:39.992
No, not at all.

984
01:01:40.158 --> 01:01:42.158
Oh, my God.
I love this kitchen.

985
01:01:42.367 --> 01:01:45.742
- Thank you so much.
- She's not looking at me.

986
01:01:45.908 --> 01:01:48.908
She's busy. She's not looking at me.

987
01:01:49.075 --> 01:01:52.283
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.

988
01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:55.450
Oh, baby Joel.
Hey, Joely! Joely!

989
01:01:55.617 --> 01:01:57.075
Is every little peanut
under there okay?

990
01:01:57.242 --> 01:01:58.617
Mm-hmm! He's fine.

991
01:01:58.783 --> 01:02:00.325
You know, do you have something to drink?

992
01:02:00.492 --> 01:02:02.825
Would you drink a cocktail at
this hour? I mean, I know it's not 5:00.

993
01:02:02.992 --> 01:02:04.658
- I would die for a vodka.
- Oh! Hang on.

994
01:02:04.825 --> 01:02:05.825
Let me check if I have that.

995
01:02:05.992 --> 01:02:08.408
Okay! I'm just gonna wait
right here. Joel! Hey, no, sweetie.

996
01:02:08.575 --> 01:02:10.492
Uh, Joely.

997
01:02:10.658 --> 01:02:12.450
Your mother wants me to mind you.

998
01:02:12.617 --> 01:02:14.283
- Get back under the table.
- Ice cream.

999
01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:16.617
- Ice cream.
- No, not until after,

1000
01:02:16.783 --> 01:02:18.158
you know, you've had your dinner.

1001
01:02:18.325 --> 01:02:19.950
Come on, Joel!

1002
01:02:21.492 --> 01:02:22.783
Joel, grow up!

1003
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:25.158
Don't leave me, Clem.
Oh, my God, Clem.

1004
01:02:25.325 --> 01:02:27.325
- This is sort of warped.
- I'm scared.

1005
01:02:27.492 --> 01:02:30.992
- I want my mommy!
- Don't cry, baby Joel.

1006
01:02:31.158 --> 01:02:35.450
Baby Joel, it's okay.
Joel. Joely. Joel!

1007
01:02:35.658 --> 01:02:38.158
Stop it! Look, I think it's working.
Look, we're hidden, Joel. Look!

1008
01:02:38.325 --> 01:02:40.325
Hey, honey, look.

1009
01:02:41.575 --> 01:02:42.575
Wait there.

1010
01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.783
My crotch is still here,
just as you remembered it.

1011
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:51.200
Yuck.

1012
01:02:54.325 --> 01:02:56.700
It stopped.

1013
01:02:57.492 --> 01:02:58.992
What?

1014
01:02:59.158 --> 01:03:01.117
It stopped erasing.

1015
01:03:01.283 --> 01:03:03.450
Oh, shit.

1016
01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:05.450
This is terrible.

1017
01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.783
He's off the map.
He's off the map.

1018
01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:11.450
- Where?
- I don't know where!

1019
01:03:11.617 --> 01:03:13.283
What do you mean? I don't know where!

1020
01:03:13.617 --> 01:03:17.367
This is bad. This is very, very bad news.
Where are my glasses?

1021
01:03:18.033 --> 01:03:20.117
Okay. Crap.

1022
01:03:20.283 --> 01:03:23.033
Okay. What do we do?
What do I do?

1023
01:03:23.575 --> 01:03:24.783
- What should we do?
- I don't know what to do.

1024
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:25.950
I don't know what to do.

1025
01:03:26.117 --> 01:03:28.033
- What should we do?
- Crap. Crap. I don't know!

1026
01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:29.200
I just said that!

1027
01:03:29.367 --> 01:03:30.658
- I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry. What should we do?

1028
01:03:30.825 --> 01:03:34.242
I don't know. Now, look,
you're freaking me out. Mellow out.

1029
01:03:34.408 --> 01:03:38.242
Well, we have to do something.
He could wake up all half-baked.

1030
01:03:38.408 --> 01:03:41.158
- Quiet. You're freaking me out. Shh. Shh.
- All gooey and--and

1031
01:03:41.325 --> 01:03:42.908
- half-baked.
- Okay.

1032
01:03:43.075 --> 01:03:44.575
Hmm, that sounds so good.

1033
01:03:44.742 --> 01:03:46.242
- Oh, shit!
- I'm hungry.

1034
01:03:46.408 --> 01:03:48.283
- Oh, shit!
- Oh! Oh!

1035
01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:50.825
What? Oh!
What, what? What?

1036
01:03:50.992 --> 01:03:53.908
- We should call Howard.
- No way. No, sir, man.

1037
01:03:54.075 --> 01:03:56.117
This is my--
I can handle this.

1038
01:03:56.283 --> 01:03:58.325
- I can't call Howard.
- He's an unbaked cookie.

1039
01:03:58.492 --> 01:04:01.242
He's--There's no time
to fuck around.

1040
01:04:01.408 --> 01:04:03.658
I got this under control.
What are you talking about?

1041
01:04:03.825 --> 01:04:06.617
- Stop fucking around!
- Okay, I'll call Howard.

1042
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:10.158
Mmm.

1043
01:04:14.617 --> 01:04:15.992
- Hello.
<i>- Hello, Howard?</i>

1044
01:04:16.158 --> 01:04:17.408
<i>Hey, it's Stan.</i>

1045
01:04:17.575 --> 01:04:21.742
Um, I'm working on this guy down here,
and we seem to have lost him for a moment,

1046
01:04:21.908 --> 01:04:24.575
and, uh, I can't--
I can't bring him back up.

1047
01:04:24.742 --> 01:04:28.075
Okay, uh, tell me what happened
before he disappeared.

1048
01:04:28.367 --> 01:04:31.575
Well, I wasn't sure, really, 'cause I was
away from the monitor for a minute

1049
01:04:31.742 --> 01:04:34.158
and I had it on autopilot
because I had to, uh--

1050
01:04:34.825 --> 01:04:35.742
I had to pee.

1051
01:04:35.908 --> 01:04:39.950
- <i>Where's Patrick?</i>
- Patrick? Patrick had to go home sick.

1052
01:04:40.117 --> 01:04:42.075
<i>Ah, geez.</i>

1053
01:04:42.825 --> 01:04:45.200
- Okay, what's the address?
<i>- I know. I'm so sorry.</i>

1054
01:04:45.367 --> 01:04:48.200
- That's okay. Come on.
<i>- I'm at 159 South Village.</i>

1055
01:04:48.367 --> 01:04:51.825
- Yeah.
<i>- Apartment 1E. Rockville Center.</i>

1056
01:04:51.992 --> 01:04:53.075
- Mary?
- Yeah?

1057
01:04:53.242 --> 01:04:54.617
He's coming right now.

1058
01:04:54.783 --> 01:04:56.617
I'm staying.

1059
01:04:56.783 --> 01:04:59.075
- Get your stuff, Mary.
- I'm staying.

1060
01:04:59.242 --> 01:05:01.492
- I think you should go.
- Hell, no.

1061
01:05:01.658 --> 01:05:05.242
Mary. Shit.

1062
01:05:05.408 --> 01:05:09.075
- I am so stoned.
- Please, Mary.

1063
01:05:09.533 --> 01:05:11.783
- You have to go.
- Stop being stoned, Mary.

1064
01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:13.867
I don't want him
to see me stoned.

1065
01:05:14.783 --> 01:05:18.867
Mary, you have no idea how much trouble
we're gonna get into if Howard comes--

1066
01:05:19.033 --> 01:05:22.033
Joely, stop it! Joel!
Look! Hey, Joel!

1067
01:05:28.117 --> 01:05:30.158
- Joel!
- I want her to pick me up.

1068
01:05:30.325 --> 01:05:33.658
- It's weird how strong that desire is.
- Joel! Joel, look at me! Look.

1069
01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:36.200
You'll remember me
in the morning,

1070
01:05:36.367 --> 01:05:39.200
and you'll come to me, and you'll tell me
about us, and we'll start over.

1071
01:05:39.367 --> 01:05:41.742
Pat? I just--Pat?

1072
01:05:41.908 --> 01:05:43.950
I thought we could have
a little cocktail.

1073
01:05:44.117 --> 01:05:46.408
That Patrick guy,
he's copying me.

1074
01:05:47.367 --> 01:05:48.450
What Patrick guy?

1075
01:05:48.617 --> 01:05:50.283
- That guy!
- What?

1076
01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:52.283
He's here in my apartment.

1077
01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:54.075
He's one of those eraser guys.

1078
01:05:54.492 --> 01:05:55.533
He fell for you
when they were doing you,

1079
01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:58.617
and now he's introduced himself
like he doesn't even know you,

1080
01:05:58.783 --> 01:06:01.033
and you guys are dating.

1081
01:06:01.492 --> 01:06:04.367
Really? Is he cute?

1082
01:06:06.908 --> 01:06:09.283
Clem, there's nothing
wrong with you.

1083
01:06:09.450 --> 01:06:11.783
You're the most wonderful
person I've ever met.

1084
01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:14.867
You--You're kind.

1085
01:06:15.033 --> 01:06:16.533
You're beautiful...

1086
01:06:17.283 --> 01:06:19.075
and smart and funny...

1087
01:06:19.533 --> 01:06:21.617
and...nice.

1088
01:06:22.825 --> 01:06:23.908
What?

1089
01:06:26.033 --> 01:06:27.575
Okay. All right.

1090
01:06:29.533 --> 01:06:31.575
Okay. Oh!

1091
01:06:31.742 --> 01:06:34.408
- Move, move, move! Come on. Let's go.
- Careful, careful.

1092
01:06:34.575 --> 01:06:35.783
Fine.

1093
01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:38.492
Oh, my God. I'm still stoned.

1094
01:06:39.492 --> 01:06:41.742
Those eye drops you gave me
didn't do shit.

1095
01:06:46.867 --> 01:06:48.242
Be cool. Cool.

1096
01:06:53.158 --> 01:06:55.242
- Hello, Mary. What are you doing here?
- Oh, hi, Howard.

1097
01:06:55.408 --> 01:06:56.825
She was just here
to help out.

1098
01:06:56.992 --> 01:07:00.658
I wanted to understand as much as
I could about the procedure as possible.

1099
01:07:00.825 --> 01:07:04.200
I think it's important for my job to
understand the inner workings

1100
01:07:04.367 --> 01:07:06.033
of the work that we do.

1101
01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:08.867
Well, not that I do,
but the work that is done...

1102
01:07:09.575 --> 01:07:13.117
by people...where I also work,
the work of my colleagues.

1103
01:07:14.117 --> 01:07:16.075
All right, well,
let's see if we can, uh,

1104
01:07:16.242 --> 01:07:18.117
get to the bottom of this,
shall we?

1105
01:07:18.992 --> 01:07:20.283
Uh, yeah. Um--

1106
01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:26.158
- Well, that's odd.
- I already tried that.

1107
01:07:26.325 --> 01:07:27.450
Did you try going through
the C-gate?

1108
01:07:27.617 --> 01:07:29.117
Yeah, of course.

1109
01:07:29.658 --> 01:07:31.658
I mean...yes.

1110
01:07:32.867 --> 01:07:33.992
Yeah.

1111
01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:37.658
All right.

1112
01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:41.575
- You want to get linked up?
- Yeah.

1113
01:07:41.742 --> 01:07:42.658
All right.

1114
01:07:44.658 --> 01:07:46.700
I already--I ran
the utility programs,

1115
01:07:46.867 --> 01:07:48.908
and I had nothing there,

1116
01:07:49.075 --> 01:07:51.783
so I checked all the memories
against the printed logs.

1117
01:07:52.867 --> 01:07:53.992
- Here, Howard.
- Okay.

1118
01:07:54.158 --> 01:07:55.450
- I got you a chair.
- Oh, thanks.

1119
01:07:55.617 --> 01:07:56.450
There you go.

1120
01:07:56.617 --> 01:07:59.158
You're welcome. Whew!

1121
01:07:59.325 --> 01:08:02.658
All right, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go through the entire memory,

1122
01:08:02.825 --> 01:08:04.825
see if something comes up.

1123
01:08:05.658 --> 01:08:08.200
♪ Oh, my darling,
oh, my darling ♪

1124
01:08:08.367 --> 01:08:11.117
♪ Oh, my darling Clementine ♪

1125
01:08:11.408 --> 01:08:14.075
- ♪ You are lost and gone forever ♪
- I love being bathed in the sink.

1126
01:08:14.242 --> 01:08:16.533
- ♪ Dreadful sorry, Clementine ♪
- Such a feeling of security.

1127
01:08:16.867 --> 01:08:18.533
I've never seen you happier,
baby Joel.

1128
01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:19.950
Hmm!

1129
01:08:20.117 --> 01:08:21.408
There it is.

1130
01:08:21.867 --> 01:08:25.367
I don't understand
why it's off the map like that.

1131
01:08:26.867 --> 01:08:28.408
What the heck
was he doing there?

1132
01:08:37.992 --> 01:08:38.950
His eyes are open.

1133
01:08:42.033 --> 01:08:44.200
- Has this happened before with him?
- No.

1134
01:08:45.617 --> 01:08:48.992
Oh, this is--
this is not good. No.

1135
01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:50.325
I'm gonna have to--

1136
01:08:51.533 --> 01:08:53.200
I'm gonna have
to give him this.

1137
01:09:17.867 --> 01:09:20.408
<i>Can't you see?
I love you, Antoine.</i>

1138
01:09:21.408 --> 01:09:23.742
Okay, we're back in.

1139
01:09:23.908 --> 01:09:26.908
Wow. That was beautiful
to watch, Howard.

1140
01:09:27.075 --> 01:09:30.242
Like a surgeon or
a concert pianist or something.

1141
01:09:32.533 --> 01:09:33.700
Thank you, Mary.

1142
01:09:34.617 --> 01:09:38.200
Um, Howard, you should get some sleep.
I-I think I'll be fine now.

1143
01:09:38.367 --> 01:09:42.742
Why can't you see I love you,
Antoine?

1144
01:09:43.492 --> 01:09:44.992
Hmm. Lucky me.

1145
01:09:45.158 --> 01:09:49.242
Lay one on me.

1146
01:09:51.367 --> 01:09:52.617
Don't call me Antoine.

1147
01:09:52.783 --> 01:09:55.200
- My name is Wally.
- Yes, I know,

1148
01:09:55.367 --> 01:09:57.658
but how can a woman love
a man with a name like Wally?

1149
01:09:57.825 --> 01:09:59.783
Oh! Oh! What was that?

1150
01:10:00.617 --> 01:10:01.742
- Hey.
- My God, there's people

1151
01:10:01.908 --> 01:10:02.908
coming out of your butt.

1152
01:10:03.075 --> 01:10:05.367
There is?

1153
01:10:07.033 --> 01:10:09.242
- Got it.
- Tangerine!

1154
01:10:09.408 --> 01:10:12.242
- What, Joel--What are you doing?
- We gotta go.

1155
01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:14.825
Go on. Please, please, go.
Please go!

1156
01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:19.575
You can run,
but you can't hide.

1157
01:10:19.908 --> 01:10:21.408
Clem, come on!

1158
01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:24.450
There I am.

1159
01:10:25.575 --> 01:10:26.575
That truck.

1160
01:10:26.742 --> 01:10:29.658
Doc? please.

1161
01:10:29.825 --> 01:10:33.658
All right,
let's begin by you telling me

1162
01:10:33.825 --> 01:10:35.658
everything you remember...

1163
01:10:36.783 --> 01:10:39.825
That's strange. He's in a memory
that we've already erased.

1164
01:10:40.658 --> 01:10:44.617
Oh, well, at least we know where he is.
He's back on track, right?

1165
01:10:44.783 --> 01:10:46.867
Come on, Clem.

1166
01:10:47.033 --> 01:10:48.867
He <i>seems to have developed some
sort of resistance to the procedure.</i>

1167
01:10:49.033 --> 01:10:52.242
- I don't want to run anymore.
- Shit.

1168
01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:55.700
Come on, come on.

1169
01:10:55.867 --> 01:10:57.992
Hide me somewhere deeper,
somewhere really buried.

1170
01:10:58.158 --> 01:11:00.658
- Where?
- Hide me in your humiliation.

1171
01:11:02.242 --> 01:11:04.617
- Humiliation.
<i>- Come on, you big baby!</i>

1172
01:11:04.783 --> 01:11:06.450
I'm sorry, okay?

1173
01:11:10.283 --> 01:11:12.825
<i>Let me drive you home.</i>

1174
01:11:13.492 --> 01:11:14.700
<i>Joel!</i>

1175
01:11:15.658 --> 01:11:17.950
- Bye, Howard.
- No, wait. Howard.

1176
01:11:19.075 --> 01:11:21.367
He's disappeared again.

1177
01:11:21.533 --> 01:11:25.658
- Oh, dear.
- I'm so sorry, Howard.

1178
01:11:26.033 --> 01:11:27.533
Humiliation.

1179
01:11:28.408 --> 01:11:29.908
Humiliation.

1180
01:11:30.533 --> 01:11:32.367
- Humili--
- Joel.

1181
01:11:33.658 --> 01:11:35.825
I don't like it either.

1182
01:11:35.992 --> 01:11:37.908
I'm just trying to find
horrible secret places to--

1183
01:11:38.075 --> 01:11:41.117
Joel, honey, I have a surprise--
I just--Oh, um--

1184
01:11:41.575 --> 01:11:44.158
Uh, you know what, honey?
I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.

1185
01:11:44.325 --> 01:11:46.200
Good night, sweetheart.

1186
01:11:47.158 --> 01:11:49.450
No.

1187
01:11:49.617 --> 01:11:51.033
I'm sorry, Joel.

1188
01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.575
- Shut up.
- Joely.

1189
01:11:53.742 --> 01:11:56.158
Look! Joel!

1190
01:11:57.158 --> 01:11:58.533
- Joel, look!
- What?

1191
01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:00.533
Look where we are!

1192
01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:02.200
- Whoo!
- Oh, no.

1193
01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:05.742
Clem, this isn't good.

1194
01:12:05.908 --> 01:12:09.492
Then hide me somewhere--
somewhere really buried.

1195
01:12:12.533 --> 01:12:14.992
- Hit it! Hit it!
- I can't! I gotta go home.

1196
01:12:15.158 --> 01:12:16.992
I'll do it later!

1197
01:12:20.825 --> 01:12:24.075
Come on, you big sissy!
Hurry up! Hit it!

1198
01:12:32.992 --> 01:12:34.700
Ooh!

1199
01:12:35.408 --> 01:12:38.075
Ooh, he has a girlfriend!

1200
01:12:38.242 --> 01:12:40.617
Wait. What am I doing?
You know something, Freddy?

1201
01:12:40.783 --> 01:12:42.825
You don't scare me anymore.
Ow! Ow!

1202
01:12:43.450 --> 01:12:44.992
Joel!

1203
01:12:45.283 --> 01:12:46.283
Joely, get up.

1204
01:12:46.450 --> 01:12:47.992
- Come on. It's not worth it.
- Hit him! Hit him!

1205
01:12:48.158 --> 01:12:52.408
They're not worth it, Joel!
La-la-la-la-la! He's not listening!

1206
01:12:52.575 --> 01:12:54.492
- Come on, Joel.
- Stupid!

1207
01:13:00.992 --> 01:13:04.075
- <i>I'm so ashamed.</i>
<i>- It's okay.</i>

1208
01:13:04.742 --> 01:13:06.950
- <i>You were a little kid.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1209
01:13:07.117 --> 01:13:09.617
- <i>Come on.</i>
<i>- That's where I live--lived.</i>

1210
01:13:09.783 --> 01:13:11.783
<i>I wish I knew you
when I was a kid.</i>

1211
01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:14.117
<i>Do you like my pink hat?
Here, look, feel better.</i>

1212
01:13:14.283 --> 01:13:15.742
<i>You can really kill me this time.</i>

1213
01:13:15.908 --> 01:13:16.825
<i>- It's my turn. Go.</i>
<i>- I can?</i>

1214
01:13:16.992 --> 01:13:17.950
- <i>One, two, three.</i>
<i>- You're really gonna die, though.</i>

1215
01:13:18.117 --> 01:13:19.242
- <i>Mm-hm.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

1216
01:13:19.408 --> 01:13:20.700
<i>One, two, three.</i>

1217
01:13:20.867 --> 01:13:23.325
<i>You're dead.</i>

1218
01:13:23.492 --> 01:13:26.658
<i>Oh, my mom. It's--It's okay.
We're playing.</i>

1219
01:13:26.825 --> 01:13:28.367
- <i>Hi, Joel's mom.</i>
<i>- It's not real.</i>

1220
01:13:28.533 --> 01:13:31.200
- He'<i>s killing me.</i>
<i>- Okay, are you dead yet?</i>

1221
01:13:31.742 --> 01:13:33.908
<i>You're dead!</i>

1222
01:13:34.075 --> 01:13:35.575
Uh, I think I got
the hang of this.

1223
01:13:35.742 --> 01:13:39.033
I still don't understand it,
but I'm finding him quickly enough.

1224
01:13:53.242 --> 01:13:55.867
Clem!

1225
01:13:57.575 --> 01:13:59.700
Clem!

1226
01:14:14.783 --> 01:14:16.658
Jo--Joely?

1227
01:14:16.825 --> 01:14:18.117
Are you okay, Joel?

1228
01:14:19.075 --> 01:14:22.200
Joel? Joel?

1229
01:14:22.367 --> 01:14:24.242
Oh, my God.
That was terrible.

1230
01:14:24.408 --> 01:14:26.325
- Okay, okay.
- That was like three seconds.

1231
01:14:26.492 --> 01:14:28.158
All right.
Let me do it one more time.

1232
01:14:28.325 --> 01:14:29.533
One more. One more, then I get to go.

1233
01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:30.700
Okay.

1234
01:14:41.117 --> 01:14:43.075
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo!

1235
01:14:43.617 --> 01:14:45.450
- Look at this.
- This is so cool!

1236
01:14:45.617 --> 01:14:47.575
Cool. Look out! Look out!

1237
01:14:51.617 --> 01:14:52.700
It's fluff.

1238
01:14:54.450 --> 01:14:56.075
Our house!

1239
01:14:57.825 --> 01:14:59.825
- Come on. Whoo-hoo!
- Come on.

1240
01:14:59.992 --> 01:15:01.783
Come on. We gotta go!

1241
01:15:01.992 --> 01:15:03.033
Whoo!

1242
01:15:04.575 --> 01:15:06.492
Come on!

1243
01:15:08.283 --> 01:15:09.492
We gotta go. Clem?

1244
01:15:09.908 --> 01:15:11.075
We gotta go.

1245
01:15:12.658 --> 01:15:14.200
Aah! Come on!

1246
01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:16.742
- No!
- This is a really bad time for this!

1247
01:15:16.908 --> 01:15:18.783
Get off me! Oh, God!

1248
01:15:20.117 --> 01:15:22.867
- I don't even know where we're going.
- It's gonna be fun. Come on.

1249
01:15:23.033 --> 01:15:25.492
- It's the best place. No, this way.
- No, this way.

1250
01:15:25.658 --> 01:15:30.158
No, no, no. This way.
You're no help at all.

1251
01:15:30.325 --> 01:15:32.825
- What's wrong with you?
- No!

1252
01:15:32.992 --> 01:15:35.200
Let go of me, Joel!

1253
01:15:48.242 --> 01:15:49.742
I like watching you work,
Howard.

1254
01:15:54.408 --> 01:15:56.033
I guess, uh--

1255
01:15:56.575 --> 01:15:59.158
I guess I'll go out
for--for some air,

1256
01:15:59.575 --> 01:16:00.908
if nobody minds.

1257
01:16:01.492 --> 01:16:03.742
It looks like you have everything
under control here.

1258
01:16:05.033 --> 01:16:06.450
Yeah, that's, uh...

1259
01:16:07.117 --> 01:16:08.117
that's fine.

1260
01:16:17.908 --> 01:16:20.450
Do you like quotes, Howard?

1261
01:16:22.867 --> 01:16:23.783
What do you mean?

1262
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:26.617
Oh, you know,
like famous quotes?

1263
01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.450
I find reading them
inspirational,

1264
01:16:29.617 --> 01:16:33.242
and in my reading, I've come across some
I thought you might like too.

1265
01:16:33.408 --> 01:16:36.908
Oh, well, I--
I'd love to hear some.

1266
01:16:37.242 --> 01:16:38.492
There's one that goes,

1267
01:16:38.992 --> 01:16:42.450
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get
the better even of their blunders."

1268
01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.158
- That's Nietzsche, right?
- Yeah.

1269
01:16:45.325 --> 01:16:47.033
And here I thought I could tell
you something you didn't know.

1270
01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.200
Oh, no.

1271
01:16:48.367 --> 01:16:51.367
It's--It's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.

1272
01:16:51.533 --> 01:16:54.367
Yeah. Oh, and there's
this other one I like.

1273
01:16:54.533 --> 01:16:57.242
It's by Pope Alexander,
and it goes--

1274
01:16:57.408 --> 01:16:59.908
- Alexander Pope?
- Oh, yeah.

1275
01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:01.283
Yeah. Shit.

1276
01:17:01.575 --> 01:17:05.742
It's just that I told myself not to say
"Pope Alexander" and sound like a dope,

1277
01:17:05.908 --> 01:17:07.825
and then I go ahead
and say it.

1278
01:17:07.992 --> 01:17:10.408
- It's no big deal.
- You're such a sweetheart.

1279
01:17:13.283 --> 01:17:16.992
The quote goes, "How happy is
the blameless vestal's lot?

1280
01:17:18.533 --> 01:17:20.700
<i>The world forgetting,
by the world forgot.</i>

1281
01:17:22.325 --> 01:17:24.783
<i>Eternal sunshine
of the spotless mind.</i>

1282
01:17:26.158 --> 01:17:29.617
<i>Each prayer accepted
and each wish resigned."</i>

1283
01:17:29.783 --> 01:17:34.200
I want to be
a great big, huge elephant...

1284
01:17:35.117 --> 01:17:36.908
with a huge trunk like that.

1285
01:17:38.492 --> 01:17:41.408
Clem? Clementine?

1286
01:17:41.575 --> 01:17:44.492
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.

1287
01:17:44.658 --> 01:17:47.325
I just thought it would
be appropriate, maybe.

1288
01:17:52.283 --> 01:17:54.450
I really admire
the work you do, Howard.

1289
01:17:56.075 --> 01:17:58.367
- I don't mean to be so familiar.
- Oh, it's fine. It's fine.

1290
01:17:58.533 --> 01:18:00.825
I-I-I-I-I--I'm happy to hear--

1291
01:18:04.867 --> 01:18:07.825
I'm sorry.

1292
01:18:12.158 --> 01:18:14.158
I've loved you
for a very long time.

1293
01:18:17.492 --> 01:18:19.700
- I shouldn't have said that.
- Oh, Mary, no.

1294
01:18:19.867 --> 01:18:22.575
It's--You're
a wonderful girl.

1295
01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:26.783
But I--You know,
I have a wife and kids.

1296
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:28.658
You know
I have a wife and kids.

1297
01:18:29.325 --> 01:18:30.617
Oh, Mary.

1298
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:35.617
Oh, Mary, we can't do this.

1299
01:18:45.783 --> 01:18:46.783
Oh, whoa.

1300
01:18:52.325 --> 01:18:54.242
Well, good morning,
Mrs. Mierzwiak.

1301
01:19:04.158 --> 01:19:05.408
- What?
- Oh, my God!

1302
01:19:05.575 --> 01:19:06.575
Who is it?

1303
01:19:12.658 --> 01:19:14.075
Uh...

1304
01:19:20.075 --> 01:19:21.908
Thank you, Stan.
Thanks a lot.

1305
01:19:27.575 --> 01:19:29.783
Hollis. Hollis!

1306
01:19:30.283 --> 01:19:31.742
Hollis!

1307
01:19:33.075 --> 01:19:34.742
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Hollis.

1308
01:19:36.158 --> 01:19:37.158
I knew it, Howard.

1309
01:19:37.325 --> 01:19:38.742
Hollis, it didn't start out
to be like this.

1310
01:19:38.908 --> 01:19:41.950
I came here to work.
Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!

1311
01:19:42.117 --> 01:19:44.450
- I'm a stupid girl with a stupid crush!
- Yeah.

1312
01:19:44.617 --> 01:19:46.533
I swear I basically
forced him into it!

1313
01:19:48.325 --> 01:19:50.658
Don't be a monster, Howard.
Tell the girl.

1314
01:19:53.783 --> 01:19:55.033
Tell me what?

1315
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:57.200
Oh, you poor kid.

1316
01:19:59.325 --> 01:20:02.283
You can have him.
You did.

1317
01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:13.950
What?

1318
01:20:17.658 --> 01:20:19.033
Oh, uh...

1319
01:20:24.867 --> 01:20:26.700
We have a history.

1320
01:20:28.450 --> 01:20:30.908
I'm sorry.
Y-You wanted the procedure.

1321
01:20:31.075 --> 01:20:32.158
You--

1322
01:20:33.408 --> 01:20:34.992
You wanted it done...

1323
01:20:35.825 --> 01:20:38.742
so you could
get past, uh...

1324
01:20:40.742 --> 01:20:42.617
You could--Yeah.

1325
01:20:44.367 --> 01:20:48.783
Um, I have to, uh,
finish the work in there.

1326
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:50.742
It's almost morning.
We'll...

1327
01:20:52.492 --> 01:20:53.783
We'll talk later.

1328
01:20:55.450 --> 01:20:56.825
Okay?

1329
01:21:08.367 --> 01:21:09.492
Hey.

1330
01:21:14.575 --> 01:21:16.075
Let me give you a lift home.

1331
01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:27.867
Fuck this thing. Damn it.

1332
01:21:28.575 --> 01:21:30.492
- Hi.
- Hi.

1333
01:21:32.075 --> 01:21:35.492
Didn't figure you'd show
your face around me again.

1334
01:21:36.533 --> 01:21:39.242
I guess I thought
you were...humiliated.

1335
01:21:39.408 --> 01:21:41.283
You did run away,
after all.

1336
01:21:41.908 --> 01:21:43.492
I just needed to see ya.

1337
01:21:44.367 --> 01:21:45.200
Yeah?

1338
01:21:46.658 --> 01:21:48.117
I'd like to, um,

1339
01:21:49.575 --> 01:21:51.492
take you out or something.

1340
01:21:52.492 --> 01:21:53.617
You're married.

1341
01:21:54.825 --> 01:21:57.075
Not yet. Not married.

1342
01:21:58.117 --> 01:21:59.825
No, I'm not married, no.

1343
01:21:59.992 --> 01:22:02.908
Look, man, I'm telling you
right off the bat I'm high maintenance,

1344
01:22:03.075 --> 01:22:07.325
so I'm not gonna tiptoe
around your marriage

1345
01:22:07.492 --> 01:22:09.575
or whatever it is
you've got going there.

1346
01:22:09.742 --> 01:22:11.700
If you wanna be with me,
you're with me.

1347
01:22:12.867 --> 01:22:13.908
Okay.

1348
01:22:14.867 --> 01:22:18.033
Too many guys think I'm a concept,
or I complete them,

1349
01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:21.117
or I'm gonna
make them alive.

1350
01:22:21.283 --> 01:22:24.742
But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's
looking for my own peace of mind.

1351
01:22:24.908 --> 01:22:28.825
- Don't assign me yours.
- I remember that speech really well.

1352
01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:32.825
- I had you pegged, didn't I?
- You had the whole human race pegged.

1353
01:22:33.158 --> 01:22:34.867
Hmm. probably.

1354
01:22:37.325 --> 01:22:39.367
I still thought you were
gonna save my life,

1355
01:22:39.825 --> 01:22:41.367
even after that.

1356
01:22:41.533 --> 01:22:44.075
Mmm. I know.

1357
01:22:47.242 --> 01:22:49.158
It would be different...

1358
01:22:50.533 --> 01:22:52.658
if we could just give it
another go around.

1359
01:22:56.783 --> 01:22:58.158
Remember me.

1360
01:22:59.575 --> 01:23:01.117
Try your best.

1361
01:23:03.992 --> 01:23:05.325
Maybe we can.

1362
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:39.700
<i>Okay, so just tell me
what you remember,</i>

1363
01:23:39.867 --> 01:23:42.242
<i>and, uh, then we'll
take it from there.</i>

1364
01:23:42.408 --> 01:23:43.408
<i>Okay.</i>

1365
01:23:44.742 --> 01:23:46.867
<i>I liked you immediately.</i>

1366
01:23:47.742 --> 01:23:49.533
<i>You didn't
come on to me at all.</i>

1367
01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:51.492
<i>I liked that.</i>

1368
01:23:53.408 --> 01:23:55.867
<i>I was so tongue-tied
around you at first.</i>

1369
01:23:56.408 --> 01:23:58.242
<i>I wanted you to think
I was smart.</i>

1370
01:24:00.283 --> 01:24:02.575
<i>I couldn't wait
to come to work.</i>

1371
01:24:02.742 --> 01:24:06.075
<i>I had these fantasies
of us being married</i>

1372
01:24:06.242 --> 01:24:09.158
<i>and having kids and...
just--</i>

1373
01:24:09.658 --> 01:24:11.783
<i>Oh, Howie, I can't do this.</i>

1374
01:24:12.658 --> 01:24:14.950
<i>We agreed it's
for the best, Mary.</i>

1375
01:24:15.117 --> 01:24:16.408
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

1376
01:24:17.908 --> 01:24:19.575
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1377
01:24:19.742 --> 01:24:21.950
- I'll take the bottom and you--
- Uh-uh-uh! No, no, no. Here.

1378
01:24:22.117 --> 01:24:23.200
- I can take that.
- So you want me to carry that?

1379
01:24:23.367 --> 01:24:25.117
Help me with that. Can you get the cooler?

1380
01:24:25.283 --> 01:24:26.575
Honey, the cooler is--

1381
01:24:26.742 --> 01:24:29.492
That's light, huh?
Oh, I can get that. Let me get it.

1382
01:24:29.658 --> 01:24:31.158
No, no, no, no!

1383
01:24:31.325 --> 01:24:33.242
- Don't take anything.
- I can take the plane.

1384
01:24:33.408 --> 01:24:35.575
Put the thing up.
Put the gate back up.

1385
01:24:38.783 --> 01:24:40.325
<i>This is the day we met.</i>

1386
01:24:41.325 --> 01:24:44.617
<i>You were down by the surf. I could just
make you out in the distance.</i>

1387
01:24:44.783 --> 01:24:46.950
<i>I remember being drawn to you
even then.</i>

1388
01:24:47.658 --> 01:24:51.075
<i>I thought, "Wow, how odd.
I'm drawn to someone's back."</i>

1389
01:24:52.492 --> 01:24:55.950
<i>You were in that orange sweatshirt that
I would come to know so well,</i>

1390
01:24:56.117 --> 01:24:58.117
<i>and even hate, eventually.</i>

1391
01:24:58.283 --> 01:25:01.992
At the time I thought, "How cool!
An orange sweatshirt."

1392
01:25:02.283 --> 01:25:03.533
Hi there.

1393
01:25:05.908 --> 01:25:06.908
Hi.

1394
01:25:07.075 --> 01:25:09.533
I saw you
sitting over here...

1395
01:25:10.158 --> 01:25:11.200
by yourself,

1396
01:25:12.033 --> 01:25:15.033
and I thought,
"Thank God.

1397
01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:17.825
Someone normal who doesn't know
how to interact at these things either."

1398
01:25:18.283 --> 01:25:19.908
Yeah.

1399
01:25:20.075 --> 01:25:22.908
I don't ever know
what to say.

1400
01:25:23.367 --> 01:25:24.783
I'm Clementine.

1401
01:25:26.033 --> 01:25:29.033
Can I borrow a piece
of your chicken?

1402
01:25:29.867 --> 01:25:31.325
And then you just took it...

1403
01:25:31.492 --> 01:25:33.825
without waiting for an answer.

1404
01:25:37.533 --> 01:25:38.867
It was so intimate,

1405
01:25:40.117 --> 01:25:41.533
like we were already lovers.

1406
01:25:44.075 --> 01:25:45.283
I'm Joel.

1407
01:25:46.283 --> 01:25:47.325
Hi, Joel.

1408
01:25:48.450 --> 01:25:50.200
So, no jokes
about my name.

1409
01:25:51.867 --> 01:25:52.867
You mean like...

1410
01:25:53.033 --> 01:25:55.783
♪ Oh, my darling, oh, my darling,
oh, my darling Clementine ♪

1411
01:25:56.325 --> 01:25:58.033
Huckleberry Hound,
that sort of thing?

1412
01:25:58.783 --> 01:26:00.700
Yeah. Like that.

1413
01:26:00.867 --> 01:26:02.658
Oh, no jokes. No jokes.

1414
01:26:03.158 --> 01:26:06.450
One of my favorite things when I was a kid
was my Huckleberry Hound doll.

1415
01:26:06.617 --> 01:26:08.033
Oh.

1416
01:26:10.658 --> 01:26:12.283
I think your name is magical.

1417
01:26:15.867 --> 01:26:17.200
This is it, Joel.

1418
01:26:18.242 --> 01:26:19.700
It's gonna be gone soon.

1419
01:26:22.450 --> 01:26:23.700
I know.

1420
01:26:25.075 --> 01:26:26.200
What do we do?

1421
01:26:29.367 --> 01:26:30.617
Enjoy it.

1422
01:26:48.492 --> 01:26:50.658
- You married?
- No.

1423
01:26:50.825 --> 01:26:52.575
Let's move into
this neighborhood!

1424
01:26:52.783 --> 01:26:55.283
I do sort of live
with someone though.

1425
01:26:55.950 --> 01:26:58.158
- Male or female?
- What?

1426
01:26:58.867 --> 01:27:01.158
Female. Female.

1427
01:27:03.575 --> 01:27:05.950
At least I'm not barking
up the wrong tree.

1428
01:27:09.867 --> 01:27:13.575
- You know these people?
- No, of course not. Come on.

1429
01:27:15.617 --> 01:27:16.617
They might have a dog.

1430
01:27:16.783 --> 01:27:18.617
There's no dog.

1431
01:27:20.450 --> 01:27:21.617
What are you doing?

1432
01:27:22.617 --> 01:27:25.658
- It's freezing out.
- I can't believe this.

1433
01:27:26.658 --> 01:27:27.658
Hoo-hoo!

1434
01:27:28.992 --> 01:27:32.492
- Clementine!
- There we go. Whoo-hoo!

1435
01:27:39.033 --> 01:27:41.450
Come on, man.
The water's fine.

1436
01:27:42.908 --> 01:27:45.075
Nobody's coming here tonight.
Believe me.

1437
01:27:48.158 --> 01:27:49.325
It's dark.

1438
01:27:50.242 --> 01:27:53.992
So, uh, what's
your girlfriend's name?

1439
01:27:54.992 --> 01:27:57.325
Naomi, but we're not really--
I mean--

1440
01:27:57.492 --> 01:27:59.867
- You know, we're--
- Whatever.

1441
01:28:00.033 --> 01:28:03.867
So this is great. Now I can look for,
um, candles, matches,

1442
01:28:04.033 --> 01:28:06.367
and the liquor cabinet.

1443
01:28:06.533 --> 01:28:08.117
Oh, God.

1444
01:28:14.908 --> 01:28:16.158
I think we should go.

1445
01:28:16.325 --> 01:28:18.825
There's no phone line.
What?

1446
01:28:18.992 --> 01:28:20.825
- I think we should go.
- Why?

1447
01:28:20.992 --> 01:28:22.575
It's our house...

1448
01:28:22.742 --> 01:28:23.742
...just for tonight.

1449
01:28:23.908 --> 01:28:26.783
We are "David and Ruth Laskin."

1450
01:28:28.325 --> 01:28:30.367
- Which one do you want to be?
Uh--

1451
01:28:30.533 --> 01:28:33.408
I prefer to be Ruth,
but I can be flexible.

1452
01:28:35.825 --> 01:28:38.158
What are you do--

1453
01:28:39.033 --> 01:28:41.283
- Alcohol!
- Oh, boy.

1454
01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:43.283
So, are you okay with wine?

1455
01:28:43.950 --> 01:28:46.450
- I don't know.
- Well, you choose the wine.

1456
01:28:46.617 --> 01:28:50.575
I'm gonna go find the bedroom
and slip into something more...Ruth.

1457
01:28:54.325 --> 01:28:56.783
- I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
- We really should go.

1458
01:28:58.825 --> 01:29:01.242
I've gotta catch my ride.

1459
01:29:03.658 --> 01:29:06.992
- So go.
- I did.

1460
01:29:08.533 --> 01:29:10.075
<i>I thought maybe you were a nut,</i>

1461
01:29:11.325 --> 01:29:12.700
<i>but you were exciting.</i>

1462
01:29:15.325 --> 01:29:17.200
<i>I wish you'd stayed.</i>

1463
01:29:17.367 --> 01:29:19.908
I wish I'd stayed too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.

1464
01:29:20.075 --> 01:29:21.617
I wish I'd done
a lot of things.

1465
01:29:22.658 --> 01:29:25.283
Oh, God, I wish I had--

1466
01:29:29.450 --> 01:29:32.575
I wish I'd stayed. I do.

1467
01:29:32.742 --> 01:29:35.033
Well, I came back downstairs,
and you were gone.

1468
01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:36.700
I walked out.
I walked out the door.

1469
01:29:37.408 --> 01:29:38.617
- Why?
- I don't know.

1470
01:29:38.783 --> 01:29:40.200
I felt like a scared little kid.

1471
01:29:40.367 --> 01:29:43.367
I was like--It was above my head.
I don't know.

1472
01:29:43.992 --> 01:29:45.325
You were scared?

1473
01:29:45.492 --> 01:29:46.908
Yeah.

1474
01:29:48.617 --> 01:29:50.117
Thought you knew that
about me.

1475
01:29:51.533 --> 01:29:55.242
<i>I ran back to the bonfire,
trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.</i>

1476
01:29:56.242 --> 01:29:58.742
- Was it something I said?
- Yeah.

1477
01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:03.492
You said, "So go"...

1478
01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:06.575
with such disdain, you know?

1479
01:30:06.742 --> 01:30:09.283
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1480
01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:16.783
Joely?

1481
01:30:17.825 --> 01:30:19.575
What if you stayed this time?

1482
01:30:22.450 --> 01:30:24.075
I walked out the door.

1483
01:30:25.408 --> 01:30:27.033
There's no memory left.

1484
01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:29.200
Come back and make up
a good-bye, at least.

1485
01:30:30.533 --> 01:30:32.075
Let's pretend we had one.

1486
01:30:43.325 --> 01:30:44.367
Bye, Joel.

1487
01:30:46.033 --> 01:30:47.450
I love you.

1488
01:30:48.158 --> 01:30:51.283
Meet me in Montauk.

1489
01:30:56.158 --> 01:30:58.617
I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.

1490
01:30:58.783 --> 01:31:00.242
I didn't crash the plane.

1491
01:31:00.408 --> 01:31:03.075
<i>You were operating
the plane with the remote control,</i>

1492
01:31:03.242 --> 01:31:04.242
<i>and then it crashed.</i>

1493
01:31:04.408 --> 01:31:06.658
It was fucking windy.
Come on, man.

1494
01:31:06.825 --> 01:31:08.783
You're stoned,
and you're driving.

1495
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:11.450
The pot balances it out.
The pot brings you back up.

1496
01:31:11.617 --> 01:31:13.867
<i>That's why I smoke it. If I'm going
to be drinking, then I'll smoke it.</i>

1497
01:31:14.992 --> 01:31:17.575
It does.
That's a medical fact.

1498
01:31:17.742 --> 01:31:20.200
It was proven
on the Science Network.

1499
01:31:20.367 --> 01:31:23.492
- Honey, just watch the road.
- I can't see shit.

1500
01:31:25.242 --> 01:31:28.075
I saw you talking
to somebody pretty.

1501
01:31:28.242 --> 01:31:30.908
- She was nice.
- Yeah, man. Who was that?

1502
01:31:33.283 --> 01:31:36.450
She was, um, just a girl.

1503
01:31:43.950 --> 01:31:44.950
Okay.

1504
01:32:22.492 --> 01:32:24.867
So I gotta--
I gotta drop the van off.

1505
01:32:25.033 --> 01:32:26.575
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.

1506
01:32:27.408 --> 01:32:30.700
We'll talk.

1507
01:33:48.408 --> 01:33:49.783
Hey!

1508
01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:53.367
Hey.

1509
01:33:55.242 --> 01:33:57.200
- You got all your stuff, I see.
- Yeah, that's right. My stuff.

1510
01:33:57.367 --> 01:33:58.492
I take it you're not coming back.

1511
01:33:59.825 --> 01:34:01.533
You know, I wouldn't come back
if I was you either.

1512
01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:03.867
- Do you swear you didn't know?
- I-I swear.

1513
01:34:05.283 --> 01:34:08.242
- So you didn't do the erasing?
- Of course not. God, no.

1514
01:34:08.408 --> 01:34:10.658
And you never even suspected
we were together?

1515
01:34:11.158 --> 01:34:13.408
Once, maybe.

1516
01:34:15.533 --> 01:34:18.325
I was coming back from a job,
and you were at his car.

1517
01:34:18.492 --> 01:34:20.908
And I saw
you two talking, and I--

1518
01:34:21.408 --> 01:34:23.825
So I waved to you,
and you giggled, and it--

1519
01:34:24.783 --> 01:34:25.950
How'd I look?

1520
01:34:28.575 --> 01:34:29.908
You looked happy.

1521
01:34:30.617 --> 01:34:32.950
Happy with a secret.

1522
01:34:34.533 --> 01:34:35.700
And after that?

1523
01:34:35.867 --> 01:34:39.492
I just--I never saw you two together
again like that, so I just--

1524
01:34:39.658 --> 01:34:42.033
I don't know. I just figured
I was imagining things.

1530
01:35:08.075 --> 01:35:10.283
I really like you,
Mary Svevo.

1531
01:35:11.492 --> 01:35:12.867
You know that?

1532
01:35:23.908 --> 01:35:24.992
Thanks.

1533
01:36:00.242 --> 01:36:01.367
Let me get my toothbrush.

1534
01:36:01.533 --> 01:36:02.950
Yeah. Just--

1535
01:36:16.908 --> 01:36:19.492
<i>Where are you, Clem? I'm worried.</i>

1536
01:36:19.658 --> 01:36:21.325
- La-la-la-la-la.
<i>- I feel like you're mad at me,</i>

1537
01:36:21.492 --> 01:36:23.242
<i>and I don't know what I did.</i>

1538
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:26.200
<i>What did I do?</i>

1539
01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:28.158
<i>I love you so much.</i>

1540
01:36:28.867 --> 01:36:30.575
<i>I'll do anything
to make you happy.</i>

1541
01:36:31.242 --> 01:36:33.158
<i>Tell me what you want me to do,
and I'll do it.</i>

1542
01:36:33.825 --> 01:36:37.242
<i>Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning
just to make sure you're okay.</i>

1543
01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:39.200
Oh. Whew.

1544
01:36:50.992 --> 01:36:53.367
<i>Vámonos, señor.</i>

1545
01:36:54.075 --> 01:36:56.450
I-I had a really nice time
last night.

1546
01:36:57.700 --> 01:36:58.825
Nice?

1547
01:36:59.158 --> 01:37:02.492
I had the best fucking night
of my entire fucking life

1548
01:37:02.658 --> 01:37:03.950
last night.

1549
01:37:04.117 --> 01:37:05.992
That's better.

1550
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:10.950
This is weird.

1551
01:37:11.158 --> 01:37:13.533
<i>To all patients

1552
01:37:13.742 --> 01:37:14.783

1555
01:37:19.783 --> 01:37:21.617
part of your memory erased."

1556
01:37:21.783 --> 01:37:23.242
<i>I have since decided
that this is a horrible--</i>

1557
01:37:23.408 --> 01:37:24.658
Some kind of teaser ad or something.

1558
01:37:24.825 --> 01:37:28.367
<i>In order to correct this,
I'm sending everyone's file back to them.</i>

1559

Clementine Kruczynski.</i>

1560
01:37:33.075 --> 01:37:35.700
<i>I'm here to erase
Joel Barish.</i>

1561
01:37:36.367 --> 01:37:38.117
- What is this?
- I don't know.

1562
01:37:38.283 --> 01:37:42.867
He'<i>s boring. Is that enough
reason to erase someone?</i>

1563
01:37:43.033 --> 01:37:45.575
<i>I've been thinking lately
how I was before and how I am now,</i>

1564
01:37:45.742 --> 01:37:47.075
<i>and it's like he changed me.</i>

1565
01:37:47.242 --> 01:37:50.492
<i>I feel like I'm always pissy now.
I don't like myself when I'm with him.</i>

1566
01:37:50.658 --> 01:37:54.117
<i>I don't like myself anymore.
I can't stand to even look at him.</i>

1567
01:37:54.825 --> 01:37:57.117
<i>That pathetic, wimpy,
apologetic smile.</i>

1568
01:37:57.283 --> 01:37:59.283
<i>That sort of wounded puppy
shit he does, you know?</i>

1569
01:37:59.450 --> 01:38:00.325
What are you doing?

1570
01:38:00.492 --> 01:38:01.492
I'm not doing anything.

1571
01:38:01.658 --> 01:38:03.033
<i>The bloom is certainly fucking
off the rose at this point.</i>

1572
01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:05.492
- Are you screwing with me?
- No!

1573
01:38:06.033 --> 01:38:08.408
- You are screwing with me.
- Joel, I'm not!

1574
01:38:08.575 --> 01:38:10.408
- You clearly are.
- Look, okay.

1575
01:38:10.575 --> 01:38:12.742
Let's just--just take a minute and--

1576
01:38:42.158 --> 01:38:43.325
Patrick, get the fuck away.

1577
01:38:43.492 --> 01:38:45.283
- Oh, sweetheart--
- Get the fuck away from me!

1578
01:38:45.992 --> 01:38:48.575
- Can we talk about it?
- No! Get the fuck away!

1579
01:39:21.283 --> 01:39:22.533
Joel Barish.

1580
01:39:23.658 --> 01:39:26.325
- Hey, Clementine.
- Hey.

1581
01:39:26.492 --> 01:39:29.408
Nice to see you. Yeah.

1582
01:39:31.158 --> 01:39:32.325
Yeah.

1583
01:39:32.825 --> 01:39:34.742
<i>...really very educated.</i>

1584
01:39:34.908 --> 01:39:38.242
<i>I mean, she's smart, I think,
but not educated.</i>

1585
01:39:38.742 --> 01:39:41.200
<i>I couldn't really talk to her
about books, you know?</i>

1586
01:39:41.367 --> 01:39:43.450
<i>She's more of
a magazine-reading girl.</i>

1587
01:39:44.867 --> 01:39:47.242
<i>Her vocabulary leaves
something to be desired.</i>

1588
01:39:48.283 --> 01:39:50.825
<i>Sometimes I was
embarrassed in public--</i>

1589
01:39:50.992 --> 01:39:52.908
- Hi.
<i>- ...because she would pronounce</i>

1590
01:39:53.075 --> 01:39:55.117
<i>- library "libary."</i>
- Hi.

1591
01:39:55.825 --> 01:39:58.075
<i>Libary. Libary.</i>

1592
01:39:59.992 --> 01:40:01.033
Look what I found.

1593
01:40:01.325 --> 01:40:04.783
<i>I think if there's a truly
seductive quality about Clementine,</i>

1594
01:40:05.450 --> 01:40:08.908
<i>it's that her personality promises
to take you out of the mundane.</i>

1595
01:40:10.492 --> 01:40:12.783
You made me look skinny.

1596
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:14.700
<i>Amazing, burning meteorite</i>

1597
01:40:15.117 --> 01:40:18.908
<i>that'll carry you to another world,
a world where things are exciting.</i>

1598
01:40:20.033 --> 01:40:22.825
<i>But what you quickly learn
is that</i>

1599
01:40:23.158 --> 01:40:25.742
<i>it's really
an elaborate ruse.</i>

1600
01:40:25.908 --> 01:40:27.700
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1601
01:40:29.658 --> 01:40:30.783
- It's okay.
<i>- ...flashy</i>

1602
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:33.033
<i>in a kind of obvious way.</i>

1603
01:40:34.075 --> 01:40:36.450
- <i>But still, it seduces you.</i>
- Joel, I really like you.

1604
01:40:36.617 --> 01:40:38.867
I hate that I said
mean things about you.

1605
01:40:39.033 --> 01:40:43.158
- Let me turn this off, okay?
- Hey, it's--it's only fair.

1606
01:40:44.658 --> 01:40:46.575
<i>Where's the real Clementine?</i>

1607
01:40:46.742 --> 01:40:49.825
<i>I mean, the whole thing
with the hair--it's all bullshit.</i>

1608
01:40:50.325 --> 01:40:52.325
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.

1609
01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:53.992
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.

1610
01:40:54.533 --> 01:40:56.242
- I do.
<i>- The world's a goddamn mess.</i>

1611
01:40:56.408 --> 01:40:58.658
<i>This is how you rebel?
Change your hair color?</i>

1612
01:40:58.825 --> 01:41:00.533
You want a drink or something?

1613
01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:02.033
Do you have any whiskey?

1614
01:41:03.450 --> 01:41:08.783
<i>No, I don't think her sex
is...motivated.</i>

1615
01:41:09.242 --> 01:41:11.992
<i>I saw it clearly the last night
we were together.</i>

1616
01:41:12.158 --> 01:41:15.325
<i>It wasn't sex.
It was just sad.</i>

1617
01:41:15.492 --> 01:41:18.533
Hey. Sorry.
I thought there was more.

1618
01:41:18.783 --> 01:41:20.367
<i>The only way Clem thinks</i>

1619
01:41:20.533 --> 01:41:23.575
<i>she can get people
to like her is to fuck 'em...</i>

1620
01:41:25.325 --> 01:41:28.575
<i>or at least dangle the possibility of
getting fucked in front of 'em.</i>

1621
01:41:29.533 --> 01:41:32.533
<i>And she's so desperate
and insecure</i>

1622
01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:36.742
<i>that she'll, sooner or later,
go around and fuck everybody.</i>

1623
01:41:37.117 --> 01:41:40.492
- I don't do that.
- I wouldn't think that about you.

1624
01:41:40.908 --> 01:41:42.575
- Because I don't.
- I know.

1625
01:41:43.617 --> 01:41:46.117
Because it really hurts me that you said
that because I don't do that.

1626
01:41:46.283 --> 01:41:47.742
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry about all this.

1627
01:41:47.908 --> 01:41:49.992
I'm gonna...go.

1628
01:41:50.158 --> 01:41:54.408
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think I can be here.

1629
01:41:59.575 --> 01:42:02.450
Um...bye.

1630
01:42:02.908 --> 01:42:05.283
- Bye.
<i>- I thought I knew her so well.</i>

1631
01:42:05.450 --> 01:42:07.783
- It was nice meeting you and all.
<i>- But I don't know her at all.</i>

1632
01:42:10.325 --> 01:42:13.533
<i>What a loss to spend
that much time with someone,</i>

1633
01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:16.408
<i>only to find out
that she's a stranger.</i>

1634
01:42:21.158 --> 01:42:22.408
Wait.

1635
01:42:24.867 --> 01:42:26.408
- What?
- I don't know.

1636
01:42:26.575 --> 01:42:28.492
- Just wait. Just wait.
- What do you want, Joel?

1637
01:42:28.783 --> 01:42:32.242
I don't know.
I want you to wait for...just a while.

1638
01:42:46.742 --> 01:42:48.617
- Okay.
- Really?

1639
01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:50.742
I'm not a concept, Joel.

1640
01:42:50.908 --> 01:42:53.825
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking
for my own peace of mind.

1641
01:42:53.992 --> 01:42:55.992
- I'm not perfect.
- I can't see anything

1642
01:42:56.158 --> 01:42:57.617
that I don't like about you.

1643
01:42:57.783 --> 01:42:59.908
- But you will. But you will.
- Right now I can't.

1644
01:43:00.450 --> 01:43:04.117
You know, you will think of things, and
I'll get bored with you and feel trapped

1645
01:43:04.283 --> 01:43:06.075
because that's
what happens with me.

1646
01:43:08.033 --> 01:43:09.492
Okay.

1647
01:43:13.742 --> 01:43:14.742
Okay.

1648
01:43:19.450 --> 01:43:21.450
- Okay.
- Okay.
