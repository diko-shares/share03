01:17:07.458 --> 01:17:10.958
- It's no big deal.
- You're such a sweetheart.

1330
01:17:12.875 --> 01:17:16.750
The quote goes,
"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot?"

1331
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.045
<i>The world forgetting,
by the world forgot.</i>

1332

and each wish resigned."</i>

1334
01:17:29.250 --> 01:17:34.337
I want to be
a great big, huge elephant...

1335
01:17:34.417 --> 01:17:36.667
with a huge trunk like that.

1336
01:17:38.208 --> 01:17:40.962
Clem? Clementine?

1337
01:17:41.042 --> 01:17:44.045
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.

1338
01:17:44.125 --> 01:17:47.083
I just thought
it would be appropriate, maybe.

1339
01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:55.337
I really admire
the work you do, Howard.

1340
01:17:55.417 --> 01:17:57.920
- I don't mean to be so familiar.
- Oh, it's fine. It's fine.

1341
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.583
I-I-I-I-I... I'm happy to hear...

1342
01:18:04.417 --> 01:18:07.333
[Sighs] I'm sorry.

1343
01:18:09.125 --> 01:18:11.337
[Sighing]

1344
01:18:11.417 --> 01:18:13.708
I've loved you
for a very long time.

1345
01:18:16.958 --> 01:18:19.337
- I shouldn't have said that.
- Oh, Mary, no.

1346
01:18:19.417 --> 01:18:22.587
It's... You're a wonderful girl.

1347
01:18:22.667 --> 01:18:26.337
But I...
You know, I have a wife and kids.

1348
01:18:26.417 --> 01:18:28.337
You know I have a wife and kids.

1349
01:18:28.417 --> 01:18:30.375
Oh, Mary.

1350
01:18:32.417 --> 01:18:35.375
Oh, Mary, we can't do this.

1351
01:18:45.417 --> 01:18:47.375
Oh, whoa.

1352
01:18:51.792 --> 01:18:55.083
Well, good morning, Mrs. Mierzwiak.

1353
01:19:00.208 --> 01:19:02.337
[Honking]

1354
01:19:02.417 --> 01:19:04.337
[Mary] What? Oh, my God!

1355
01:19:04.417 --> 01:19:07.170
Who is it?

1356
01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:09.167
[Sighs]

1357
01:19:11.417 --> 01:19:13.833
Uh...

1358
01:19:19.542 --> 01:19:21.667
Thank you, Stan. Thanks a lot.

1359
01:19:26.458 --> 01:19:29.337
Hollis. Hollis!
[Engine Starts]

1360
01:19:29.417 --> 01:19:31.962
Hollis!

1361
01:19:32.042 --> 01:19:35.337
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Hollis.

1362
01:19:35.417 --> 01:19:38.295
- I knew it, Howard.
- Hollis, it didn't start out to be like this.

1363
01:19:38.375 --> 01:19:41.503
I came here to work.
Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!

1364
01:19:41.583 --> 01:19:44.003
- I'm a stupid girl with a stupid crush!
- Yeah.

1365
01:19:44.083 --> 01:19:46.583
I swear I basically forced him into it!

1366
01:19:47.792 --> 01:19:50.417
Don't be a monster, Howard.
Tell the girl.

1367
01:19:53.208 --> 01:19:55.628
Tell me what?

1368
01:19:55.708 --> 01:19:57.875
Oh, you poor kid.

1369
01:19:58.792 --> 01:20:02.042
You can have him. You did.

1370
01:20:12.208 --> 01:20:13.458
What?

1371
01:20:17.375 --> 01:20:18.792
Oh, uh,

1372
01:20:24.417 --> 01:20:26.458
we have a history.

1373
01:20:27.917 --> 01:20:30.712
I'm sorry.
Y-You wanted the procedure.

1374
01:20:30.792 --> 01:20:33.045
You...

1375
01:20:33.125 --> 01:20:35.337
You wanted it done...

1376
01:20:35.417 --> 01:20:38.500
so you could get past, uh...

1377
01:20:40.417 --> 01:20:42.375
You could... Yeah.

1378
01:20:43.833 --> 01:20:48.712
Um, I have to, uh,
finish the work in there.

1379
01:20:48.792 --> 01:20:50.500
It's almost morning. We'll...

1380
01:20:52.208 --> 01:20:54.083
We'll talk later.

1381
01:20:55.167 --> 01:20:56.583
Okay?

1382
01:21:08.083 --> 01:21:09.917
[Stan] Hey.

1383
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:15.833
Let me give you a lift home.

1384
01:21:24.875 --> 01:21:28.212
Fuck this thing. Damn it.

1385
01:21:28.292 --> 01:21:30.250
- Hi.
- Hi.

1386
01:21:31.542 --> 01:21:35.920
Didn't figure you'd show
your face around me again.

1387
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.795
I guess I thought
you were... humiliated.

1388
01:21:38.875 --> 01:21:41.087
You did run away, after all.

1389
01:21:41.167 --> 01:21:44.003
I just needed to see ya.

1390
01:21:44.083 --> 01:21:46.295
Yeah?

1391
01:21:46.375 --> 01:21:49.212
I'd like to, um,

1392
01:21:49.292 --> 01:21:52.128
take you out or something.

1393
01:21:52.208 --> 01:21:54.503
You're married.

1394
01:21:54.583 --> 01:21:57.503
Not yet. Not married.

1395
01:21:57.583 --> 01:21:59.337
No, I'm not married, no.

1396
01:21:59.417 --> 01:22:02.462
Look, man, I'm telling you
right off the bat I'm high maintenance,

1397
01:22:02.542 --> 01:22:06.878
so I'm not gonna tiptoe
around your marriage...

1398
01:22:06.958 --> 01:22:09.128
or whatever it is
you've got going there.

1399
01:22:09.208 --> 01:22:11.458
If you wanna be with me,
you're with me.

1400
01:22:12.417 --> 01:22:14.753
Okay.

1401
01:22:14.833 --> 01:22:17.587
Too many guys think I'm a concept,
or I complete them,

1402
01:22:17.667 --> 01:22:20.420
or I'm gonna make them alive.

1403
01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:24.295
But I'm just a fucked-up girl
who's looking for my own peace of mind.

1404
01:22:24.375 --> 01:22:29.087
- Don't assign me yours.
- I remember that speech really well.

1405
01:22:29.167 --> 01:22:32.378
- I had you pegged, didn't I?
- You had the whole human race pegged.

1406
01:22:32.458 --> 01:22:34.625
Hmm. Probably.

1407
01:22:36.792 --> 01:22:39.170
I still thought you were
gonna save my life,

1408
01:22:39.250 --> 01:22:41.170
even after that.

1409
01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:44.542
Mmm. I know.

1410
01:22:46.708 --> 01:22:48.917
It would be different...

1411
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.417
if we could just give it
another go around.

1412
01:22:56.417 --> 01:22:58.587
Remember me.

1413
01:22:58.667 --> 01:23:00.875
Try your best.

1414
01:23:03.167 --> 01:23:05.083
Maybe we can.

tell me what you remember,</i>

I was smart.</i>

of us being married...</i>

<i>Oh, God.</i>

1430
01:24:19.208 --> 01:24:21.503
- I'll take the bottom and you...
- Uh-uh-uh! No, no, no. Here.

1431
01:24:21.583 --> 01:24:23.337
I can take that.
So you want me to carry that?

1432
01:24:23.417 --> 01:24:26.128
- Help me with that. Can you get the cooler?
- Honey, the cooler is...

1433
01:24:26.208 --> 01:24:28.962
That's light, huh? Oh, I can get that.
You can get it.

No, no, no, no!

1435

- Don't take anything.
- I can take the plane.

even then.</i>

1440

by yourself,

1448
01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:14.337

how to interact at these things either."

1456
01:25:37.250 --> 01:25:39.503
It was so intimate,

1457

like we were already lovers.

Uh...

I prefer to be Ruth,

So, are you okay with wine?

1506
01:28:43.417 --> 01:28:46.170
- I don't know.
- Well, you choose the wine.

1507
01:28:46.250 --> 01:28:50.333
I'm gonna go find the bedroom
and slip into something more... Ruth.

- Yeah.

01:40:44.375 --> 01:40:46.295
<i>Where's the real Clementine?</i>

1661
01:40:46.375 --> 01:40:49.378
<i>I mean, the whole thing
with the hair... it's all bullshit.</i>

1662
01:40:49.458 --> 01:40:52.337
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.

1663
01:40:52.417 --> 01:40:54.420
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.

1664
01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:56.378
- I do.
- <i>The world's a damn mess.</i>

1665
01:40:56.458 --> 01:41:00.337
<i>- This is how you rebel? Change your hair color?</i>
- You want a drink or something?

1666
01:41:00.417 --> 01:41:02.545
Do you have any whiskey?

1667
01:41:02.625 --> 01:41:08.337
<i>No, I don't think
her sex is... motivated.</i>

1668
01:41:08.417 --> 01:41:11.545
<i>I saw it clearly the last
night we were together.</i>

1669
01:41:11.625 --> 01:41:14.878
<i>It wasn't sex. It was just sad.</i>

1670
01:41:14.958 --> 01:41:18.170
Hey. Sorry.
I thought there was more.

1671
01:41:18.250 --> 01:41:23.333
<i>The only way Clem thinks she can get
people to like her is to fuck 'em...</i>

1672
01:41:25.042 --> 01:41:28.920
<i>or at least dangle the possibility
of getting fucked in front of 'em.</i>

1673
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.087
<i>And she's so desperate and insecure...</i>

1674
01:41:32.167 --> 01:41:36.920
<i>that she'll, sooner or later,
go around and fuck everybody.</i>

1675
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.295
- I don't do that.
- I wouldn't think that about you.

1676
01:41:40.375 --> 01:41:43.003
- Because I don't.
- I know.

1677
01:41:43.083 --> 01:41:45.420
Because it really hurts me that you
said that because I don't do that.

1678
01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:49.337
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry about all this. I'm gonna... go.

1679
01:41:49.417 --> 01:41:54.167
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think I can be here.

1680
01:41:58.417 --> 01:42:02.295
Um... bye.

1681
01:42:02.375 --> 01:42:04.837
- Bye.
- <i>[On Tape] I thought I knew her so well.</i>

1682
01:42:04.917 --> 01:42:08.500
- It was nice meeting you and all.
<i>- But I don't know her at all.</i>

1683
01:42:09.792 --> 01:42:13.087
<i>What a loss to spend
that much time with someone,</i>

1684
01:42:13.167 --> 01:42:16.167
<i>only to find out
that she's a stranger.</i>

1685
01:42:20.875 --> 01:42:22.375
Wait.

1686
01:42:24.417 --> 01:42:25.962
- What?
- I don't know.

1687
01:42:26.042 --> 01:42:28.170
- Just wait. Just wait.
- What do you want, Joel?

1688
01:42:28.250 --> 01:42:32.000
I don't know. I want you to wait for...
just a while.

1689
01:42:41.917 --> 01:42:44.125
[Sobs]

1690
01:42:46.417 --> 01:42:48.545
- Okay.
- Really?

1691
01:42:48.625 --> 01:42:50.295
I'm not a concept, Joel.

1692
01:42:50.375 --> 01:42:53.337
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's
looking for my own peace of mind.

1693
01:42:53.417 --> 01:42:54.337
I'm not perfect.

1694
01:42:54.417 --> 01:42:57.170
I can't see anything that
I don't like about you.

1695
01:42:57.250 --> 01:43:00.128
But you will. But you will.
Right now I can't.

1696
01:43:00.208 --> 01:43:03.670
You will think of things, and I'll
get bored with you and feel trapped...

1697
01:43:03.750 --> 01:43:05.833
because that's
what happens with me.

1698
01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:09.250
Okay.

1699
01:43:13.042 --> 01:43:14.458
Okay.

1700
01:43:16.250 --> 01:43:19.087
[Crying]

1701
01:43:19.167 --> 01:43:21.167
Okay. Okay.
