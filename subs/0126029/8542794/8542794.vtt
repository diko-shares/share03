00:00:49.997 --> 00:00:54.626
"Once upon a time
there was a lovely princess.

2
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.714
"But she had an enchantment
upon her of a fearful sort,

3
00:00:58.797 --> 00:01:02.384
"which could only be broken
by love's first kiss.

4
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.096
"She was locked away in a castle

5
00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:09.516
"guarded by a terrible
fire-breathing dragon.

6
00:01:10.475 --> 00:01:14.855
"Many brave knights had attempted
to free her from this dreadful prison,

7
00:01:14.938 --> 00:01:16.940
"but none prevailed.

8
00:01:17.774 --> 00:01:19.943
"She waited in the dragon's keep

9
00:01:20.027 --> 00:01:22.946
"in the highest room of the tallest tower,

10
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.576
"for her true love
and true love's first kiss."

11
00:01:29.036 --> 00:01:30.662
Like that's ever gonna happen.

12
00:01:31.413 --> 00:01:33.957
What a load of...

13
00:03:10.345 --> 00:03:12.472
-Go!
-Go!

14
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.919
-I think it's in there.
-All right. Let's get it!

15
00:03:43.003 --> 00:03:45.755
Hold on. Do you know
what that thing can do to you?

16
00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:48.800
Yeah, it'll grind your bones for its bread.

17
00:03:49.551 --> 00:03:52.846
Yes, well, actually,
that would be a giant.

18
00:03:53.513 --> 00:03:56.975
Now, ogres, they're much worse.

19
00:03:57.058 --> 00:03:59.978
They'll make a suit
from your freshly peeled skin.

20
00:04:00.061 --> 00:04:02.147
-No!
-They'll shave your liver.

21
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.484
Squeeze the jelly from your eyes!

22
00:04:05.567 --> 00:04:08.111
-Actually, it's quite good on toast.
-Back! Back, beast!

23
00:04:08.195 --> 00:04:10.322
Back! I warn ya!

24
00:04:15.118 --> 00:04:16.536
Right.

25
00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:36.056
This is the part where you run away.

26
00:04:42.813 --> 00:04:45.857
And stay out!

27
00:04:47.734 --> 00:04:50.821
"Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."

28
00:04:58.912 --> 00:05:00.330
All right. This one's full. Take it away!

29
00:05:01.498 --> 00:05:05.377
-Move it along. Come on! Get up!
-Next!

30
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.380
Give me that! Your flying days are over.

31
00:05:08.463 --> 00:05:11.091
That's 20 pieces of silver
for the witch. Next!

32
00:05:11.174 --> 00:05:13.927
-Get up! Come on!
-Twenty pieces.

33
00:05:15.554 --> 00:05:18.098
-Sit down there!
-Keep quiet!

34
00:05:19.516 --> 00:05:21.893
This cage is too small.

35
00:05:21.977 --> 00:05:24.062
Please don't turn me in.
I'll never be stubborn again.

36
00:05:24.145 --> 00:05:25.772
I can change.
Please! Give me another chance!

37
00:05:25.855 --> 00:05:28.608
-Shut up.
-Next!

38
00:05:28.692 --> 00:05:31.570
-What have you got?
-This little, wooden puppet.

39
00:05:31.653 --> 00:05:35.448
I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy.

40
00:05:36.658 --> 00:05:39.035
Five shillings for the possessed toy.

41
00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:41.204
-Take it away.
-Father, please! Don't let them do this!

42
00:05:41.288 --> 00:05:42.956
-Help me!
-Next. What have you got?

43
00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.917
Well, I've got a talking donkey.

44
00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:50.547
Right. Well, that's good for 10 shillings,
if you can prove it.

45
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.466
Go ahead, little fella.

46
00:05:55.218 --> 00:05:56.553
Well?

47
00:05:56.636 --> 00:05:59.347
He's just... He's just a little nervous.

48
00:05:59.431 --> 00:06:03.393
He's really quite a chatterbox.
Talk, you boneheaded dolt!

49
00:06:03.476 --> 00:06:06.062
-That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
-No, no, he talks!

50
00:06:06.146 --> 00:06:07.897
He does.

51
00:06:08.023 --> 00:06:10.275
can talk. I love to talk.

52
00:06:10.358 --> 00:06:13.278
I'm the talkingest
damn thing you ever saw.

53
00:06:13.361 --> 00:06:15.905
-Get her out of my sight.
-No, no!

54
00:06:15.989 --> 00:06:20.410
swear! He can talk!

55
00:06:23.663 --> 00:06:25.123
Hey! I can fly!

56
00:06:25.206 --> 00:06:26.833
-He can fly!
-He can fly!

57
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.627
He can talk!

58
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.297
That's right, fool!
Now I'm a flying, talking donkey.

59
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.008
You might have seen a housefly,
maybe even a superfly,

60
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:38.178
but I bet you ain't
never seen a donkey fly.

61
00:06:44.517 --> 00:06:46.478
Seize him!

62
00:06:48.438 --> 00:06:51.274
After him! He's getting away!

63
00:06:59.115 --> 00:07:02.327
Get him! This way! Turn!

64
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.834
You, there. Ogre!

65
00:07:09.918 --> 00:07:12.212
Aye?

66
00:07:12.295 --> 00:07:13.964
By the order of Lord Farquaad,

67
00:07:14.047 --> 00:07:16.383
I am authorised to place you both
under arrest

68
00:07:16.466 --> 00:07:22.055
and transport you to
a designated resettlement facility.

69
00:07:22.138 --> 00:07:26.184
Oh, really? You and what army?

70
00:07:36.945 --> 00:07:38.947
Can I say something to you?

71
00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:42.367
Listen, you was really, really somethin'
back there. Incredible!

72
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:48.206
Are you talkin' to me?

73
00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:49.666
Yes, I was talkin' to you.

74
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:52.252
Can I tell you that you was great
back there? I mean, those guards.

75
00:07:52.335 --> 00:07:55.046
They thought they was all of that.
Then you showed up, and bam!

76
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.090
They was trippin' over themselves
like babes in the woods.

77
00:07:57.173 --> 00:07:59.092
That really made me
feel good to see that.

78
00:07:59.175 --> 00:08:02.220
-That's great. Really.
-Man, it's good to be free.

79
00:08:02.303 --> 00:08:07.851
Now, why don't you go celebrate your
freedom with your own friends?

80
00:08:07.934 --> 00:08:13.982
But I don't have any friends,
and I'm not goin' out there by myself.

81
00:08:14.065 --> 00:08:16.609
Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea!
I'll stick with you.

82
00:08:16.693 --> 00:08:18.611
You're a mean, green, fightin' machine.

83
00:08:18.695 --> 00:08:20.905
Together, we'll scare the spit
out of anybody that crosses us.

84
00:08:25.285 --> 00:08:27.954
Wow! That was really scary.

85
00:08:28.037 --> 00:08:29.330
And if you don't mind me sayin',

86
00:08:29.414 --> 00:08:31.750
if that don't work, your breath
certainly will get the job done,

87
00:08:31.833 --> 00:08:33.585
'cause you definitely need
some Tic Tacs or something,

88
00:08:33.668 --> 00:08:34.961
'cause your breath stinks!

89
00:08:36.504 --> 00:08:38.256
Man, you almost burned the hair
out of my nose,

90
00:08:38.339 --> 00:08:41.176
just like the time...

91
00:08:41.259 --> 00:08:42.719
And then I ate some rotten berries.

92
00:08:42.802 --> 00:08:44.971
I had strong gases eking out of my butt
that day.

93
00:08:45.055 --> 00:08:47.766
Why are you following me?

94
00:08:48.892 --> 00:08:51.436
I'll tell you why.

95
00:08:52.103 --> 00:08:54.439
'Cause I'm all alone

96
00:08:54.522 --> 00:08:58.276
There's no one here beside me

97
00:08:58.359 --> 00:09:00.487
My problems have all gone

98
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.324
There's no one to deride me

99
00:09:05.825 --> 00:09:07.494
But you gotta have friends

100
00:09:07.577 --> 00:09:10.622
Stop singing!

101
00:09:10.705 --> 00:09:12.749
It's no wonder
you don't have any friends.

102
00:09:14.542 --> 00:09:16.461
Only a true friend
would be that truly honest.

103
00:09:16.544 --> 00:09:20.632
Listen, little donkey.
Take a look at me. What am I?

104
00:09:25.512 --> 00:09:28.765
-Really tall?
-No! I'm an ogre.

105
00:09:28.848 --> 00:09:32.060
You know,
"Grab your torch and pitchforks."

106
00:09:32.143 --> 00:09:34.145
Doesn't that bother you?

107
00:09:34.229 --> 00:09:36.356
Nope.

108
00:09:36.439 --> 00:09:39.317
-Really?
-Really, really.

109
00:09:40.235 --> 00:09:42.529
Man, I like you. What's your name?

110
00:09:44.614 --> 00:09:46.282
Shrek.

111
00:09:46.366 --> 00:09:49.619
Shrek? Well, you know
what I like about you, Shrek?

112
00:09:49.702 --> 00:09:52.664
You got that kind of l-don't-care
what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing.

113
00:09:52.747 --> 00:09:56.543
I like that. I respect that, Shrek.
You all right.

114
00:09:58.211 --> 00:10:01.714
Look at that.
Who'd want to live in a place like that?

115
00:10:01.798 --> 00:10:05.009
That would be my home.

116
00:10:05.552 --> 00:10:09.138
And it is lovely! Just beautiful.
You are quite a decorator.

117
00:10:09.222 --> 00:10:11.850
It's amazing what you've done
with such a modest budget.

118
00:10:11.933 --> 00:10:16.688
I like that boulder.
That is a nice boulder.

119
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.152
I guess you don't entertain much,
do you?

120
00:10:23.236 --> 00:10:25.029
I like my privacy.

121
00:10:25.113 --> 00:10:27.949
You know, I do, too. That's another
thing we have in common.

122
00:10:28.032 --> 00:10:29.826
Like, I hate it when
you got somebody in your face.

123
00:10:29.909 --> 00:10:31.494
You're trying to give them a hint,
and they won't leave.

124
00:10:31.578 --> 00:10:34.247
Then there's that big, awkward silence,
you know.

125
00:10:37.375 --> 00:10:39.878
-Can I stay with you?
-What?

126
00:10:39.961 --> 00:10:42.505
Can I stay with you, please?

127
00:10:42.589 --> 00:10:44.924
-Of course!
-Really?

128
00:10:45.008 --> 00:10:47.510
-No.
-Please! I don't wanna go back there!

129
00:10:47.594 --> 00:10:51.389
You don't know what it's like to be
considered a freak. Well, maybe you do.

130
00:10:51.472 --> 00:10:54.058
But that's why we gotta stick together.
You gotta let me stay!

131
00:10:54.142 --> 00:10:57.270
-Please! Please!
-Okay! Okay!

132
00:10:57.353 --> 00:10:59.939
-But one night only.
-Thank you!

133
00:11:00.023 --> 00:11:02.358
-What are you... No! No!
-This is gonna be fun!

134
00:11:02.442 --> 00:11:04.360
We can stay up late,
swappin' manly stories,

135
00:11:04.444 --> 00:11:07.238
and in the mornin', I'm makin' waffles.

136
00:11:08.907 --> 00:11:10.575
Where do I sleep?

137
00:11:10.658 --> 00:11:12.410
Outside!

138
00:11:13.494 --> 00:11:15.997
Oh, well, I guess that's cool.

139
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.749
I mean, I don't know you
and you don't know me,

140
00:11:17.832 --> 00:11:20.251
so I guess outside is best, you know.

141
00:11:21.502 --> 00:11:23.463
Here I go.

142
00:11:25.465 --> 00:11:27.884
Good night.

143
00:11:29.636 --> 00:11:33.640
I mean, I do like the outdoors.
I'm a donkey. I was born outside.

144
00:11:33.723 --> 00:11:36.392
I'll just be sitting by myself
outside, I guess, you know.

145
00:11:36.476 --> 00:11:38.770
By myself, outside.

146
00:11:38.853 --> 00:11:43.650
I'm all alone
There's no one here beside me

147
00:12:48.381 --> 00:12:50.550
I thought I told you to stay outside.

148
00:12:50.633 --> 00:12:53.636
am outside.

149
00:12:59.809 --> 00:13:03.604
Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm,
but what choice do we have?

150
00:13:03.688 --> 00:13:06.190
It's not home, but it'll do just fine.

151
00:13:06.274 --> 00:13:09.318
-What a lovely bed.
-Got ya.

152
00:13:09.402 --> 00:13:11.029
found some cheese.

153
00:13:12.238 --> 00:13:13.740
Awful stuff.

154
00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:17.535
-Is that you, Gorder?
-How did you know?

155
00:13:17.618 --> 00:13:21.247
Enough! What are you doing
in my house?

156
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:22.582
Hey!

157
00:13:23.708 --> 00:13:26.669
Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table.

158
00:13:26.753 --> 00:13:29.922
Where are we supposed to put her?
The bed's taken.

159
00:13:33.426 --> 00:13:34.886
What?

160
00:13:34.969 --> 00:13:39.724
I live in a swamp. I put up signs.
I'm a terrifying ogre!

161
00:13:39.807 --> 00:13:42.435
What do I have to do
to get a little privacy?

162
00:13:44.103 --> 00:13:47.732
Oh, no. Oh, no.

163
00:13:47.815 --> 00:13:50.401
No! No!

164
00:13:53.071 --> 00:13:54.364
What?

165
00:13:54.447 --> 00:13:56.449
-Quit it.
-Don't push.

166
00:14:00.828 --> 00:14:03.748
What are you doing in my swamp?

167
00:14:03.831 --> 00:14:06.250
Swamp! Swamp! Swamp!

168
00:14:08.461 --> 00:14:09.670
Oh, dear.

169
00:14:12.673 --> 00:14:15.218
All right, get out of here.
All of you, move it!

170
00:14:15.301 --> 00:14:17.220
Come on! Let's go! Hapaya!
Hapaya! Hey!

171
00:14:17.303 --> 00:14:19.263
-Quickly. Come on!
-No, no!

172
00:14:19.347 --> 00:14:21.724
No, no. Not there. Not there.

173
00:14:26.312 --> 00:14:28.106
Hey, don't look at me.
I didn't invite them.

174
00:14:28.189 --> 00:14:30.274
Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

175
00:14:30.358 --> 00:14:32.944
-What?
-We were forced to come here.

176
00:14:33.027 --> 00:14:35.154
-By who?
-Lord Farquaad.

177
00:14:35.238 --> 00:14:39.992
He huffed und he puffed
und he signed an eviction notice.

178
00:14:40.076 --> 00:14:42.787
All right.

179
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:47.125
Who knows where
this Farquaad guy is?

180
00:14:48.501 --> 00:14:50.002
do. I know where he is.

181
00:14:50.086 --> 00:14:53.798
Does anyone else
know where to find him?

182
00:14:55.883 --> 00:14:57.510
-Anyone at all?
-Me! Me!

183
00:14:57.593 --> 00:14:59.512
-Anyone?
-Pick me!

184
00:14:59.595 --> 00:15:02.014
I know! I know! Me, me!

185
00:15:02.807 --> 00:15:05.226
Okay, fine.

186
00:15:05.309 --> 00:15:10.189
Attention, all fairy tale things.

187
00:15:10.273 --> 00:15:14.652
Do not get comfortable.
Your welcome is officially worn out.

188
00:15:14.735 --> 00:15:18.447
In fact, I'm gonna see
this guy Farquaad right now,

189
00:15:18.531 --> 00:15:21.659
and get you all off my land
and back where you came from!

190
00:15:31.002 --> 00:15:34.172
You! You're comin' with me.

191
00:15:34.255 --> 00:15:36.716
All right, that's what I like to hear, man.

192
00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:40.470
Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends,
off on a whirlwind, big-city adventure.

193
00:15:40.553 --> 00:15:42.555
love it!

194
00:15:42.638 --> 00:15:44.307
On the road again

195
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:45.808
-Sing it with me, Shrek.
-Hey.

196
00:15:45.892 --> 00:15:48.227
I can't wait to get
On the road again

197
00:15:48.311 --> 00:15:50.521
What did I say about singing?

198
00:15:50.605 --> 00:15:51.856
-Well, can I whistle?
-No.

199
00:15:51.939 --> 00:15:54.734
-Can I hum it?
-All right, hum it.

200
00:16:24.514 --> 00:16:27.558
That's enough. He's ready to talk.

201
00:16:40.488 --> 00:16:42.949
"Run, run, run, as fast as you can.

202
00:16:43.032 --> 00:16:46.577
"You can't catch me.
I'm the gingerbread man!"

203
00:16:46.661 --> 00:16:50.248
-You're a monster.
-I'm not the monster here. You are.

204
00:16:50.331 --> 00:16:55.002
You, and the rest of that fairy tale
trash, poisoning my perfect world.

205
00:16:55.086 --> 00:16:56.587
Now, tell me! Where are the others?

206
00:16:56.671 --> 00:16:58.464
Eat me!

207
00:16:59.298 --> 00:17:02.218
I've tried to be fair to you creatures.

208
00:17:02.301 --> 00:17:05.805
Now my patience has reached its end!
Tell me or I'll...

209
00:17:05.888 --> 00:17:09.016
No, no, not the buttons.
Not my gumdrop buttons.

210
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.768
All right, then. Who's hiding them?

211
00:17:10.851 --> 00:17:16.190
Okay, I'll tell you.
Do you know the muffin man?

212
00:17:16.274 --> 00:17:18.609
-The muffin man?
-The muffin man.

213
00:17:18.693 --> 00:17:22.113
Yes, I know the muffin man,
who lives on Drury Lane?

214
00:17:22.196 --> 00:17:25.616
Well, she's married to the muffin man.

215
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.827
-The muffin man?
-The muffin man!

216
00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:30.913
She's married to the muffin man.

217
00:17:30.997 --> 00:17:32.665
My lord! We found it.

218
00:17:32.748 --> 00:17:35.960
Well, then what are you waiting for?
Bring it in.

219
00:17:50.683 --> 00:17:54.312
-Magic Mirror...
-Don't tell him anything!

220
00:17:54.979 --> 00:17:56.689
No!

221
00:17:58.733 --> 00:18:00.526
'Evening.

222
00:18:00.609 --> 00:18:02.486
Mirror, Mirror, on the wall,

223
00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:05.948
is this not the most
perfect kingdom of them all?

224
00:18:06.032 --> 00:18:08.617
Well, technically, you're not a king.

225
00:18:09.076 --> 00:18:10.494
"helonious.

226
00:18:12.204 --> 00:18:15.833
-You were saying?
-What I mean is, you're not a king yet.

227
00:18:15.916 --> 00:18:19.503
But you can become one.
All you have to do is marry a princess.

228
00:18:20.004 --> 00:18:21.547
Go on.

229
00:18:22.673 --> 00:18:26.302
So, just sit back and relax, my lord,

230
00:18:26.385 --> 00:18:30.681
because it's time for you to meet
today's eligible bachelorettes.

231
00:18:30.765 --> 00:18:33.225
And here they are!

232
00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:35.269
Bachelorette number one

233
00:18:35.353 --> 00:18:39.398
is a mentally abused shut-in
from a kingdom far, far away.

234
00:18:39.482 --> 00:18:41.734
She likes sushi and hot-tubbing anytime.

235
00:18:41.817 --> 00:18:45.279
Her hobbies include cooking
and cleaning for her two evil sisters.

236
00:18:45.363 --> 00:18:47.740
Please welcome Cinderella.

237
00:18:47.823 --> 00:18:50.284
Bachelorette number two
is a cape-wearing girl

238
00:18:50.368 --> 00:18:51.869
from the land of fancy.

239
00:18:51.952 --> 00:18:54.664
Although she lives with
seven other men, she's not easy.

240
00:18:54.747 --> 00:18:58.292
Just kiss her dead, frozen lips
and find out what a live wire she is.

241
00:18:58.376 --> 00:19:02.505
Come on. Give it up for Snow White!

242
00:19:02.588 --> 00:19:04.840
And last, but certainly not least,

243
00:19:04.924 --> 00:19:06.926
bachelorette number three
is a fiery redhead

244
00:19:07.009 --> 00:19:09.553
from a dragon-guarded castle
surrounded by hot, boiling lava!

245
00:19:09.637 --> 00:19:12.223
But don't let that cool you off.
She's a loaded pistol

246
00:19:12.306 --> 00:19:14.934
who likes pina coladas
and getting caught in the rain.

247
00:19:15.017 --> 00:19:19.188
Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona!

248
00:19:19.271 --> 00:19:21.607
So, will it be bachelorette number one,

249
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:25.194
bachelorette number two
or bachelorette number three?

250
00:19:25.277 --> 00:19:27.446
-Two! Two!
-Three! Three!

251
00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:28.864
-Two! Two!
-Three!

252
00:19:28.948 --> 00:19:31.075
Three? One? Three?

253
00:19:31.158 --> 00:19:33.202
Three! Pick number three, my lord!

254
00:19:33.285 --> 00:19:37.039
Okay, okay, number three!

255
00:19:37.123 --> 00:19:41.919
Lord Farquaad,
you've chosen Princess Fiona.

256
00:19:46.757 --> 00:19:51.429
Princess Fiona. She's perfect.

257
00:19:51.512 --> 00:19:53.889
All I have to do is
just find someone who can go...

258
00:19:53.973 --> 00:19:56.600
But I probably should mention
the little thing that happens at night.

259
00:19:56.684 --> 00:19:58.602
-I'll do it.
-Yes, but after sunset...

260
00:19:58.686 --> 00:20:02.773
Silence! I will make
this Princess Fiona my queen,

261
00:20:02.857 --> 00:20:07.027
and Duloc will finally
have the perfect king!

262
00:20:07.111 --> 00:20:09.321
Captain, assemble your finest men.

263
00:20:09.405 --> 00:20:13.200
We're going to have a tournament.

264
00:20:15.911 --> 00:20:18.414
But that's it. That's it right there.
That's Duloc.

265
00:20:18.497 --> 00:20:20.082
I told ya I'd find it.

266
00:20:20.166 --> 00:20:24.295
So, that must be
Lord Farquaad's castle.

267
00:20:24.378 --> 00:20:26.464
That's the place.

268
00:20:26.547 --> 00:20:30.759
Do you think maybe
he's compensating for something?

269
00:20:34.221 --> 00:20:36.182
Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.

270
00:20:36.265 --> 00:20:39.143
Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.

271
00:20:41.187 --> 00:20:43.647
Hey, you!

272
00:20:43.731 --> 00:20:47.193
Wait a second.
Look, I'm not gonna eat ya.

273
00:20:47.276 --> 00:20:49.904
I just... I just...

274
00:21:21.727 --> 00:21:23.312
It's quiet.

275
00:21:25.731 --> 00:21:28.025
Too quiet.

276
00:21:30.611 --> 00:21:34.740
-Where is everybody?
-Hey, look at this!

277
00:21:48.128 --> 00:21:51.549
Welcome to Duloc
Such a perfect town

278
00:21:51.632 --> 00:21:55.344
Here we have some rules
Let us lay them down

279
00:21:55.427 --> 00:21:59.014
Don't make waves, stay in line
And we'll get along fine

280
00:21:59.098 --> 00:22:02.726
Duloc is a perfect place

281
00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:07.356
Please keep off of the grass
Shine your shoes, wipe your face

282
00:22:07.439 --> 00:22:11.026
Duloc is, Duloc is

283
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:15.948
Duloc is a perfect place

284
00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:23.872
Wow.

285
00:22:24.832 --> 00:22:28.794
-Let's do that again!
-No. No. No, no, no! No.

286
00:22:32.006 --> 00:22:33.507
Brave knights.

287
00:22:33.591 --> 00:22:37.803
You are the best and brightest
in all the land.

288
00:22:37.886 --> 00:22:40.306
Today, one of you shall prove himself...

289
00:22:40.389 --> 00:22:42.892
All right. You're going the right way
for a smacked bottom.

290
00:22:42.975 --> 00:22:44.768
Sorry about that.

291
00:22:45.519 --> 00:22:50.357
That champion shall have the honour...
No, no, the privilege

292
00:22:50.441 --> 00:22:54.445
to go forth and rescue
the lovely Princess Fiona

293
00:22:54.528 --> 00:22:57.865
from the fiery keep of the dragon.

294
00:22:57.948 --> 00:23:02.161
If for any reason
the winner is unsuccessful,

295
00:23:02.244 --> 00:23:05.414
the first runner-up will take his place

296
00:23:05.497 --> 00:23:08.292
and so on and so forth.

297
00:23:08.375 --> 00:23:14.048
Some of you may die,
but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make.

298
00:23:19.011 --> 00:23:21.472
Let the tournament begin!

299
00:23:27.061 --> 00:23:28.854
What is that?

300
00:23:30.898 --> 00:23:34.360
-It's hideous!
-That's not very nice.

301
00:23:35.319 --> 00:23:37.488
It's just a donkey.

302
00:23:37.571 --> 00:23:40.532
Indeed. Knights, new plan!

303
00:23:40.616 --> 00:23:45.329
The one who kills the ogre
will be named champion! Have at him!

304
00:23:45.412 --> 00:23:49.375
-Get him!
-Hey! Now, come on! Hang on now.

305
00:23:50.584 --> 00:23:51.710
Go ahead! Get him!

306
00:23:51.794 --> 00:23:55.464
Can't we just settle this over a pint?

307
00:23:55.547 --> 00:23:56.799
Kill the beast!

308
00:23:56.882 --> 00:24:00.135
No? All right then.

309
00:24:01.428 --> 00:24:03.514
Come on!

310
00:24:19.405 --> 00:24:20.572
Damn!

311
00:24:34.461 --> 00:24:36.380
Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!

312
00:24:45.222 --> 00:24:46.265
Yeah!

313
00:24:48.475 --> 00:24:50.436
The chair! Give him the chair!

314
00:25:10.038 --> 00:25:12.458
Oh, yeah!

315
00:25:15.419 --> 00:25:16.628
Thank you!

316
00:25:16.712 --> 00:25:20.674
Thank you very much!
I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal!

317
00:25:27.055 --> 00:25:29.016
Shall I give the order, sir?

318
00:25:29.099 --> 00:25:32.686
No, I have a better idea.

319
00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:37.941
People of Duloc,
I give you our champion!

320
00:25:38.025 --> 00:25:41.904
-What?
-Congratulations, ogre.

321
00:25:41.987 --> 00:25:46.325
You've won the honour of embarking
on a great and noble quest.

322
00:25:46.408 --> 00:25:50.788
Quest? I'm already on a quest,
a quest to get my swamp back.

323
00:25:50.871 --> 00:25:54.082
-Your swamp?
-Yeah, my swamp!

324
00:25:54.166 --> 00:25:56.668
Where you dumped
those fairy tale creatures!

325
00:25:57.795 --> 00:26:01.465
Indeed. All right, ogre,
I'll make you a deal.

326
00:26:01.548 --> 00:26:05.344
Go on this quest for me,
and I'll give you your swamp back.

327
00:26:05.427 --> 00:26:08.138
Exactly the way it was?

328
00:26:08.222 --> 00:26:10.974
Down to the last
slime-covered toadstool.

329
00:26:11.058 --> 00:26:14.311
-And the squatters?
-As good as gone.

330
00:26:18.315 --> 00:26:21.151
What kind of quest?

331
00:26:21.485 --> 00:26:23.987
Okay, let me get this straight.
You're gonna go fight a dragon

332
00:26:24.071 --> 00:26:26.782
and rescue a princess just so
Farquaad will give you back a swamp,

333
00:26:26.865 --> 00:26:29.785
which you only don't have because
he filled it full of freaks in the first place.

334
00:26:29.868 --> 00:26:31.453
-Is that about right?
-You know what?

335
00:26:31.537 --> 00:26:34.331
Maybe there's a good reason
donkeys shouldn't talk.

336
00:26:34.414 --> 00:26:37.793
I don't get it, Shrek. Why don't you just
pull some of that ogre stuff on him?

337
00:26:37.876 --> 00:26:39.962
You know, throttle him,
lay siege to his fortress,

338
00:26:40.045 --> 00:26:42.881
grind his bones to make your bread,
the whole ogre trip.

339
00:26:42.965 --> 00:26:44.883
know what.

340
00:26:44.967 --> 00:26:47.469
Maybe I could have
decapitated an entire village

341
00:26:47.553 --> 00:26:49.388
and put their heads on a pike,

342
00:26:49.471 --> 00:26:53.100
gotten a knife, cut open their spleen
and drink their fluids.

343
00:26:53.183 --> 00:26:55.310
Does that sound good to you?

344
00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.021
No, not really, no.

345
00:26:58.105 --> 00:27:01.900
For your information, there's a lot more
to ogres than people think.

346
00:27:01.984 --> 00:27:04.736
-Example?
-Example?

347
00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:09.158
Okay, ogres are like onions.

348
00:27:09.241 --> 00:27:11.827
-They stink?
-Yes. No!

349
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:13.328
-They make you cry?
-No!

350
00:27:13.412 --> 00:27:15.414
You leave them out in the sun,
they get all brown,

351
00:27:15.497 --> 00:27:16.832
start sproutin' little, white hairs.

352
00:27:16.915 --> 00:27:18.917
No! Layers!

353
00:27:19.001 --> 00:27:21.336
Onions have layers.

354
00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.715
Ogres have layers! Onions have layers.

355
00:27:24.798 --> 00:27:27.217
You get it? We both have layers.

356
00:27:29.136 --> 00:27:32.097
You both have layers.

357
00:27:33.849 --> 00:27:36.184
You know, not everybody likes onions.

358
00:27:36.268 --> 00:27:38.896
Cake! Everybody loves cakes!
Cakes have layers.

359
00:27:38.979 --> 00:27:42.900
I don't care what everyone likes.

360
00:27:42.983 --> 00:27:46.695
Ogres are not like cakes.

361
00:27:48.822 --> 00:27:51.116
You know what else
everybody likes? Parfaits.

362
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.785
Have you ever met a person,
you say, "Let's get some parfait,"

363
00:27:53.869 --> 00:27:56.371
they say, "No, I don't like no parfait"?
Parfaits are delicious.

364
00:27:56.455 --> 00:28:00.709
No! You dense, irritating,
miniature beast of burden!

365
00:28:00.792 --> 00:28:03.503
Ogres are like onions! End of story.

366
00:28:03.587 --> 00:28:06.423
Bye-bye. See ya later.

367
00:28:10.636 --> 00:28:14.097
Parfaits may be the most delicious thing
on the whole damn planet.

368
00:28:14.181 --> 00:28:17.184
You know, I think I preferred
your humming.

369
00:28:17.267 --> 00:28:19.937
Do you have a tissue or something?
'Cause I'm making a mess.

370
00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.940
Just the word parfait
make me start slobbering.

371
00:29:03.021 --> 00:29:04.690
Shrek! Did you do that?

372
00:29:04.773 --> 00:29:07.317
Man, you gotta warn somebody
before you just crack one off.

373
00:29:07.401 --> 00:29:09.695
-My mouth was open and everything.
-Believe me, Donkey,

374
00:29:09.778 --> 00:29:12.364
if it was me, you'd be dead.

375
00:29:13.573 --> 00:29:15.200
It's brimstone.

376
00:29:15.283 --> 00:29:18.453
-We must be getting close.
-Yeah, right, brimstone.

377
00:29:18.537 --> 00:29:20.163
Don't be talking about it's the brimstone.

378
00:29:20.247 --> 00:29:22.624
I know what I smell.
It wasn't no brimstone.

379
00:29:22.708 --> 00:29:24.668
It didn't come off no stone neither.

380
00:29:42.686 --> 00:29:46.023
Sure, it's big enough,
but look at the location.

381
00:29:49.151 --> 00:29:51.361
Shrek?

382
00:29:51.445 --> 00:29:54.823
Remember when you said
that ogres have layers?

383
00:29:54.906 --> 00:29:55.991
Aye.

384
00:29:57.034 --> 00:29:59.536
Well, I have a bit
of a confession to make.

385
00:29:59.619 --> 00:30:01.163
Donkeys don't have layers.

386
00:30:01.246 --> 00:30:02.998
We wear our fear right out there
on our sleeves.

387
00:30:03.081 --> 00:30:05.876
Wait a second.
Donkeys don't have sleeves.

388
00:30:05.959 --> 00:30:07.169
You know what I mean.

389
00:30:07.252 --> 00:30:09.921
You can't tell me
you're afraid of heights.

390
00:30:10.005 --> 00:30:12.841
No, I'm just a little uncomfortable
about being on a rickety bridge

391
00:30:12.924 --> 00:30:14.593
over a boiling lake of lava!

392
00:30:14.676 --> 00:30:18.722
Come on, Donkey.
I'm right here beside ya, okay?

393
00:30:18.805 --> 00:30:21.475
For emotional support,

394
00:30:21.558 --> 00:30:26.104
we'll just tackle this thing together
one little baby step at a time.

395
00:30:26.188 --> 00:30:28.106
-Really?
-Really, really.

396
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:30.192
Okay, that makes me feel
so much better.

397
00:30:30.275 --> 00:30:31.401
Just keep moving.

398
00:30:31.485 --> 00:30:36.073
-And don't look down.
-Okay, don't look down. Don't look down.

399
00:30:36.156 --> 00:30:39.534
Don't look down.
Keep on moving. Don't look down.

400
00:30:41.661 --> 00:30:43.413
Shrek! I'm lookin' down!

401
00:30:43.497 --> 00:30:46.416
Oh, God, I can't do this!
Just let me off right now. Please.

402
00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:50.045
-But you're already halfway.
-But I know that half is safe!

403
00:30:50.128 --> 00:30:52.923
Okay, fine. I don't have time for this.
You go back.

404
00:30:53.006 --> 00:30:55.425
-Shrek, no! Wait!
-Just, Donkey...

405
00:30:55.509 --> 00:30:58.595
-Let's have a dance then, shall we?
-Don't do that!

406
00:30:58.678 --> 00:31:02.557
I'm sorry. Do what?

407
00:31:02.641 --> 00:31:05.727
-This?
-Yes, that!

408
00:31:05.811 --> 00:31:09.272
Yes? Yes, do it. Okay.

409
00:31:10.357 --> 00:31:11.608
No, Shrek!

410
00:31:11.691 --> 00:31:14.820
-No! Stop it!
-You said do it! I'm doin1 it.

411
00:31:15.028 --> 00:31:19.157
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
Shrek, I'm gonna die.

412
00:31:21.827 --> 00:31:24.830
That'll do, Donkey. That'll do.

413
00:31:29.376 --> 00:31:30.877
Cool.

414
00:31:31.545 --> 00:31:34.297
So where is this
fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?

415
00:31:34.381 --> 00:31:38.135
Inside, waiting for us to rescue her.

416
00:31:38.218 --> 00:31:41.138
I was talkin1 about the dragon, Shrek.

417
00:31:57.487 --> 00:31:58.530
You afraid?

418
00:31:58.613 --> 00:32:00.907
No, but...

419
00:32:01.992 --> 00:32:04.327
Good. Me, neither.

420
00:32:06.955 --> 00:32:08.999
'Cause there's nothin'
wrong with bein' afraid.

421
00:32:09.082 --> 00:32:12.335
Fear's a sensible response
to an unfamiliar situation.

422
00:32:12.419 --> 00:32:14.462
Unfamiliar dangerous situation,
I might add.

423
00:32:14.546 --> 00:32:17.174
With a dragon that breathes fire
and eats knights and breathes fire,

424
00:32:17.257 --> 00:32:18.800
it sure doesn't mean you're a coward

425
00:32:18.884 --> 00:32:20.719
if you're a little scared,
you know what I mean?

426
00:32:20.802 --> 00:32:23.221
'Cause I sure as heck ain't no coward.
I know that.

427
00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:28.226
Donkey, two things, okay?

428
00:32:28.977 --> 00:32:31.354
Shut up.

429
00:32:31.438 --> 00:32:33.690
Now, go over there
and see if you can find any stairs.

430
00:32:33.773 --> 00:32:36.401
Stairs? I thought we was lookin'
for the princess.

431
00:32:36.484 --> 00:32:41.364
The princess will be up the stairs
in the highest room in the tallest tower.

432
00:32:41.448 --> 00:32:45.035
-What makes you think she'll be there?
-I read it in a book once.

433
00:32:45.118 --> 00:32:49.039
Cool. You handle the dragon.
I'll handle the stairs.

434
00:32:49.122 --> 00:32:52.167
I'll find those stairs.
I'll whip their butt, too.

435
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:54.211
That's right. Those stairs won't know
which way they're goin'.

436
00:32:59.216 --> 00:33:00.675
I'm gonna take drastic steps.

437
00:33:00.759 --> 00:33:03.553
Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with me.
I'm the stair master.

438
00:33:03.637 --> 00:33:06.431
I've mastered the stairs.
I wish I had a step right here.

439
00:33:06.515 --> 00:33:07.974
I'd step all over it.

440
00:33:11.436 --> 00:33:14.731
Well, at least we know
where the princess is, but where's the...

441
00:33:14.814 --> 00:33:16.900
Dragon!

442
00:33:32.666 --> 00:33:34.918
Donkey, look out!

443
00:33:46.972 --> 00:33:48.974
Got ya!

444
00:34:24.342 --> 00:34:26.011
No. Oh, no. No!

445
00:34:27.846 --> 00:34:29.347
Oh, what large teeth you have.

446
00:34:31.558 --> 00:34:33.059
I mean, white, sparkling teeth.

447
00:34:33.143 --> 00:34:35.395
I know you probably hear this
all the time from your food,

448
00:34:35.478 --> 00:34:36.771
but you must bleach or something,

449
00:34:36.855 --> 00:34:39.441
'cause that is one dazzling smile
you got there.

450
00:34:39.524 --> 00:34:42.193
Do I detect a hint of minty freshness?

451
00:34:42.277 --> 00:34:44.112
And you know what else?
You know what else?

452
00:34:44.195 --> 00:34:47.032
You're... You're a girl dragon!

453
00:34:47.115 --> 00:34:51.620
Sure. I mean,
of course you're a girl dragon.

454
00:34:51.703 --> 00:34:55.498
'Cause you're just reeking
of feminine beauty.

455
00:34:55.582 --> 00:34:57.917
What's the matter with you?
You got something in your eye?

456
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.340
Man, I'd really love to stay,
but, you know, I'm...

457
00:35:03.423 --> 00:35:05.300
I'm an asthmatic,
and I don't know if it'd work out

458
00:35:05.383 --> 00:35:07.510
if you're gonna blow smoke rings
and stuff.

459
00:35:07.594 --> 00:35:09.387
Shrek!

460
00:35:11.389 --> 00:35:15.101
No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

461
00:35:48.426 --> 00:35:49.886
-Wake up!
-What?

462
00:35:49.969 --> 00:35:51.596
Are you Princess Fiona?

463
00:35:52.263 --> 00:35:54.391
am.

464
00:35:54.474 --> 00:35:57.018
Awaiting a knight
so bold as to rescue me.

465
00:35:57.102 --> 00:35:59.104
That's nice. Now, let's go.

466
00:35:59.187 --> 00:36:01.189
But wait, Sir Knight.

467
00:36:01.272 --> 00:36:03.566
This be-eth our first meeting.

468
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:07.362
Should it not be a wonderful,
romantic moment?

469
00:36:07.445 --> 00:36:11.783
-Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.
-Hey, wait. What are you doing?

470
00:36:11.866 --> 00:36:13.952
You should sweep me off my feet,

471
00:36:14.035 --> 00:36:17.414
out yonder window and down a rope
onto your valiant steed.

472
00:36:17.497 --> 00:36:20.291
You've had a lot of time to plan this,
haven't you?

473
00:36:24.712 --> 00:36:27.590
But we have to savour this moment!

474
00:36:27.674 --> 00:36:30.427
You could recite an epic poem for me.

475
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:32.971
A ballad? A sonnet!

476
00:36:33.054 --> 00:36:36.307
-A limerick? Or something!
-I don't think so.

477
00:36:37.475 --> 00:36:40.812
Can I at least know
the name of my champion?

478
00:36:40.895 --> 00:36:42.814
Shrek.

479
00:36:43.648 --> 00:36:46.609
Sir Shrek.

480
00:36:46.693 --> 00:36:51.448
I pray that you take this favour
as a token of my gratitude.

481
00:36:52.574 --> 00:36:54.576
"hanks!

482
00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:00.415
You didn't slay the dragon?

483
00:37:00.498 --> 00:37:02.959
It's on my to-do list. Now, come on!

484
00:37:03.042 --> 00:37:05.128
But this isn't right!

485
00:37:05.211 --> 00:37:08.506
You were meant to charge in,
sword drawn, banner flying.

486
00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:10.133
That's what all the other knights did.

487
00:37:10.216 --> 00:37:12.510
Yeah, right before they burst into flame.

488
00:37:12.594 --> 00:37:14.512
That's not the point.

489
00:37:16.222 --> 00:37:18.683
Wait. Where are you going?
The exit's over there.

490
00:37:18.767 --> 00:37:20.810
Well, I have to save my ass.

491
00:37:20.894 --> 00:37:24.105
What kind of knight are you?

492
00:37:24.189 --> 00:37:26.608
One of a kind.

493
00:37:26.691 --> 00:37:29.068
Slow down. Slow down, baby, please.

494
00:37:29.152 --> 00:37:31.696
I believe it's healthy
to get to know someone

495
00:37:31.779 --> 00:37:35.325
over a long period of time.
Just call me old-fashioned.

496
00:37:36.117 --> 00:37:39.621
I don't want to rush into
a physical relationship.

497
00:37:39.704 --> 00:37:43.166
I'm not emotionally ready
for a commitment of this

498
00:37:43.249 --> 00:37:45.543
magnitude, really,
is the word I'm looking for.

499
00:37:45.627 --> 00:37:49.130
Magnitude. Hey,
that is unwanted physical contact.

500
00:37:49.214 --> 00:37:51.674
Hey, what are you doing?

501
00:37:51.758 --> 00:37:55.011
Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little
and take this one step at a time.

502
00:37:55.094 --> 00:37:57.931
We really should get to know each other
first as friends,

503
00:37:58.014 --> 00:37:59.224
or maybe even as pen pals.

504
00:37:59.307 --> 00:38:03.520
'Cause I'm on the road a lot,
but I just love receiving cards...

505
00:38:03.603 --> 00:38:06.022
Hey, you know,
I'd really love to stay, but...

506
00:38:06.105 --> 00:38:08.691
Hey, hey, don't do that! That's my tail!
That's my personal tail.

507
00:38:08.775 --> 00:38:11.110
You're gonna tear it off.
I don't give permission to...

508
00:38:11.194 --> 00:38:12.362
What are you gonna do with that?

509
00:38:13.446 --> 00:38:16.074
Hey, now. No way. No! No!

510
00:38:16.157 --> 00:38:18.910
No, no! No. No, no, no! No!

511
00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:47.730
-Hi, Princess!
-It talks!

512
00:38:47.814 --> 00:38:51.568
Yeah, it's getting him to shut up
that's the trick.

513
00:39:27.145 --> 00:39:29.063
Okay, you two, head for the exit!

514
00:39:31.399 --> 00:39:33.943
I'll take care of the dragon.

515
00:39:39.324 --> 00:39:41.492
Run!

516
00:40:29.666 --> 00:40:31.000
You did it!

517
00:40:31.084 --> 00:40:33.962
You rescued me!
You're amazing. You're...

518
00:40:34.045 --> 00:40:37.799
You're wonderful. You're...

519
00:40:37.882 --> 00:40:40.176
A little unorthodox, I'll admit.

520
00:40:40.259 --> 00:40:45.181
But thy deed is great,
and thine heart is pure.

521
00:40:45.556 --> 00:40:47.475
I am eternally in your debt.

522
00:40:49.143 --> 00:40:53.481
And where would a brave knight be
without his noble steed?

523
00:40:53.564 --> 00:40:56.901
All right, I hope you heard that.
She called me a noble steed.

524
00:40:56.985 --> 00:40:58.236
She think I'm a steed.

525
00:40:59.696 --> 00:41:01.489
"he battle is won.

526
00:41:01.572 --> 00:41:04.075
You may remove your helmet,
good Sir Knight.

527
00:41:04.867 --> 00:41:06.744
-No.
-Why not?

528
00:41:06.828 --> 00:41:09.038
have helmet hair.

529
00:41:09.122 --> 00:41:12.333
Please. I would'st look
upon the face of my rescuer.

530
00:41:12.417 --> 00:41:15.003
No, no, you wouldn't'st.

531
00:41:15.086 --> 00:41:17.547
But how will you kiss me?

532
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:21.426
What? That wasn't
in the job description.

533
00:41:22.343 --> 00:41:23.845
Maybe it's a perk.

534
00:41:23.928 --> 00:41:28.349
No, it's destiny.
You must know how it goes.

535
00:41:28.433 --> 00:41:32.228
A princess locked in a tower
and beset by a dragon

536
00:41:32.311 --> 00:41:35.231
is rescued by a brave knight,

537
00:41:35.314 --> 00:41:38.609
and then they share true love's first kiss.

538
00:41:39.402 --> 00:41:40.778
With Shrek? You think... Wait.

539
00:41:40.862 --> 00:41:44.032
Wait. Wait a second.
You think that Shrek is your true love?

540
00:41:44.115 --> 00:41:46.117
Well, yes.

541
00:41:50.163 --> 00:41:52.623
You think Shrek is your true love!

542
00:41:52.707 --> 00:41:54.625
What is so funny?

543
00:41:54.709 --> 00:41:57.795
Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?

544
00:41:57.879 --> 00:42:01.382
Of course you are. You're my rescuer.

545
00:42:01.466 --> 00:42:03.926
Now... Now, remove your helmet.

546
00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:06.220
Look. I really don't think
this is a good idea.

547
00:42:06.304 --> 00:42:08.306
-Just take off the helmet.
-I'm not going to.

548
00:42:08.389 --> 00:42:09.557
-Take it off.
-No!

549
00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.726
-Now!
-Okay!

550
00:42:11.809 --> 00:42:16.314
Easy. As you command, Your Highness.

551
00:42:27.075 --> 00:42:29.827
You... You're an ogre.

552
00:42:30.995 --> 00:42:33.790
You were expecting Prince Charming.

553
00:42:33.873 --> 00:42:36.375
Well, yes, actually.

554
00:42:38.294 --> 00:42:43.966
Oh, no. This is all wrong.
You're not supposed to be an ogre.

555
00:42:45.092 --> 00:42:49.263
Princess, I was sent to rescue you
by Lord Farquaad, okay?

556
00:42:49.347 --> 00:42:51.265
He's the one who wants to marry you.

557
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:53.267
Well, then why didn't he come
rescue me?

558
00:42:53.935 --> 00:42:57.688
Good question. You should ask him that
when we get there.

559
00:42:57.855 --> 00:43:03.611
But I have to be rescued by my true love,
not by some ogre and his pet.

560
00:43:03.694 --> 00:43:05.780
So much for noble steed.

561
00:43:05.863 --> 00:43:08.491
Look, Princess, you're not making
my job any easier.

562
00:43:08.574 --> 00:43:11.953
Well, I'm sorry, but your job
is not my problem.

563
00:43:12.036 --> 00:43:17.291
You can tell Lord Farquaad
that if he wants to rescue me properly,

564
00:43:17.375 --> 00:43:19.710
I'll be waiting for him right here.

565
00:43:19.794 --> 00:43:24.841
Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy,
all right? I'm a delivery boy.

566
00:43:24.924 --> 00:43:27.176
You wouldn't dare.

567
00:43:28.177 --> 00:43:29.637
-Put me down!
-Ya comin', Donkey?

568
00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.305
Yeah, I'm right behind ya.

569
00:43:31.389 --> 00:43:34.976
Put me down,
or you will suffer the consequences!

570
00:43:35.059 --> 00:43:37.812
This is not dignified! Put me down!

571
00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:44.068
Okay, so here's another question.
Say there's a woman that digs you, right,

572
00:43:44.151 --> 00:43:45.653
but you don't really like her that way.

573
00:43:45.736 --> 00:43:48.114
How do you let her down real easy
so her feelings aren't hurt,

574
00:43:48.197 --> 00:43:50.700
but you don't get burned to a crisp
and eaten? How do you do that?

575
00:43:50.783 --> 00:43:53.536
You just tell her she's not your true love.

576
00:43:53.619 --> 00:43:56.330
Everyone knowest what happens
when you find your...

577
00:43:56.414 --> 00:43:58.124
Hey!

578
00:43:59.083 --> 00:44:01.377
The sooner we get to Duloc the better.

579
00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:04.380
Yeah, you're gonna love it there,
Princess. It's beautiful!

580
00:44:04.463 --> 00:44:08.217
And what of my groom-to-be?
Lord Farquaad? What's he like?

581
00:44:08.301 --> 00:44:10.428
Let me put it this way, Princess.

582
00:44:11.345 --> 00:44:15.349
Men of Farquaad's stature
are in short supply.

583
00:44:16.601 --> 00:44:20.688
I don't know, Shrek.
There are those who think little of him.

584
00:44:22.815 --> 00:44:25.693
Stop it. Stop it, both of you.

585
00:44:25.776 --> 00:44:27.987
You know, you're just jealous you can
never measure up

586
00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:30.740
to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.

587
00:44:30.823 --> 00:44:33.743
Yeah, well,
maybe you're right, Princess.

588
00:44:33.826 --> 00:44:37.121
But I'll let you do the "measuring"
when you see him tomorrow.

589
00:44:37.205 --> 00:44:41.417
Tomorrow? It'll take that long?

590
00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:46.214
-Shouldn't we stop to make camp?
-No, that'll take longer.

591
00:44:46.297 --> 00:44:50.760
-We can keep going.
-But there's robbers in the woods.

592
00:44:51.302 --> 00:44:54.138
Time-out, Shrek! Camping's definitely
starting to sound good.

593
00:44:54.222 --> 00:44:58.309
Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything
we're going to see in this forest.

594
00:44:58.392 --> 00:45:00.770
I need to find somewhere to camp now!

595
00:45:07.652 --> 00:45:11.739
-Hey! Over here.
-Shrek, we can do better than that.

596
00:45:11.822 --> 00:45:14.408
Now, I don't think
this is fit for a princess.

597
00:45:14.492 --> 00:45:17.620
No, no, it's perfect.
It just needs a few homey touches.

598
00:45:17.703 --> 00:45:22.333
Homey touches? Like what?

599
00:45:22.959 --> 00:45:26.462
A door?
Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night.

600
00:45:26.545 --> 00:45:29.090
You want me to come in there and read
you a bedtime story? Because I will.

601
00:45:29.173 --> 00:45:31.050
I said good night!

602
00:45:34.345 --> 00:45:35.930
Shrek, what are you doing?

603
00:45:36.013 --> 00:45:40.476
I... You know... Come on.
I was just kidding.

604
00:45:47.066 --> 00:45:50.653
And that one, that's Throwback,

605
00:45:50.736 --> 00:45:54.156
the only ogre to ever spit
over three wheat fields.

606
00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.368
Right. Yeah.

607
00:45:58.452 --> 00:46:00.329
Hey, can you tell my future
from these stars?

608
00:46:00.413 --> 00:46:04.208
Well, the stars don't tell the future,
Donkey. They tell stories.

609
00:46:04.292 --> 00:46:09.797
Look, there's Bloodnut, the flatulent.
You can guess what he's famous for.

610
00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:11.507
All right, now I know
you're making this up.

611
00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:14.176
No, look. There he is,

612
00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:17.346
and there's the group of hunters
running away from his stench.

613
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:20.016
Man, that ain't nothin'
but a bunch of little dots.

614
00:46:20.099 --> 00:46:24.395
You know, Donkey, sometimes things
are more than they appear.

615
00:46:26.355 --> 00:46:27.732
Forget it.

616
00:46:31.861 --> 00:46:34.989
Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do
when we get our swamp anyway?

617
00:46:35.072 --> 00:46:36.490
Our swamp?

618
00:46:36.574 --> 00:46:39.285
You know, when we're through
rescuing the princess and all that stuff.

619
00:46:39.368 --> 00:46:43.414
We? Donkey, there's no we.
There's no our.

620
00:46:43.497 --> 00:46:46.208
There's just me and my swamp.

621
00:46:46.292 --> 00:46:50.546
The first thing I'm gonna do is build
a 10-foot wall around my land.

622
00:46:51.797 --> 00:46:54.759
You cut me deep, Shrek.
You cut me real deep just now.

623
00:46:56.635 --> 00:46:58.095
You know what I think?

624
00:46:58.179 --> 00:47:01.766
I think this whole wall thing
is just a way to keep somebody out.

625
00:47:01.849 --> 00:47:06.020
-No, do ya think?
-Are you hidin' something?

626
00:47:06.103 --> 00:47:08.147
Never mind, Donkey.

627
00:47:08.272 --> 00:47:11.525
This is another one of
those onion things, isn't it?

628
00:47:11.609 --> 00:47:15.488
No, this is one of those
drop-it-and-leave-it-alone things.

629
00:47:15.571 --> 00:47:19.075
-Why don't you want to talk about it?
-Why do you want to talk about it?

630
00:47:19.158 --> 00:47:20.951
-Why are you blocking?
-I'm not blocking.

631
00:47:21.035 --> 00:47:23.204
-Yes, you are.
-Donkey, I'm warning you.

632
00:47:23.287 --> 00:47:25.247
Who you trying to keep out?
Just tell me that, Shrek. Who?

633
00:47:25.331 --> 00:47:27.458
Everyone! Okay?

634
00:47:28.125 --> 00:47:30.294
Now we're gettin' somewhere.

635
00:47:30.377 --> 00:47:33.547
For the love of Pete!

636
00:47:33.631 --> 00:47:36.467
What's your problem, Shrek? What you
got against the whole world, anyway?

637
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:38.844
Look, I'm not the one
with the problem, okay?

638
00:47:38.928 --> 00:47:41.806
It's the world that seems
to have a problem with me.

639
00:47:41.889 --> 00:47:45.893
People take one look at me
and go, "Help! Run!

640
00:47:45.976 --> 00:47:48.229
"A big, stupid, ugly ogre!"

641
00:47:50.648 --> 00:47:52.691
They judge me
before they even know me.

642
00:47:53.984 --> 00:47:55.903
That's why I'm better off alone.

643
00:48:04.954 --> 00:48:06.080
You know what?

644
00:48:06.163 --> 00:48:10.084
When we met, I didn't think you was
just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

645
00:48:11.961 --> 00:48:14.797
Yeah, I know.

646
00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:18.300
So, are there any donkeys up there?

647
00:48:18.384 --> 00:48:24.140
Well, there's Gabby,
the small and annoying.

648
00:48:24.223 --> 00:48:29.145
Okay, okay. I see it now. The big, shiny
one, right there. That one there?

649
00:48:29.228 --> 00:48:31.439
-That's the moon.
-Okay.

650
00:48:54.712 --> 00:48:56.589
Again. Show me again.

651
00:49:00.634 --> 00:49:04.221
Mirror, mirror, show her to me.
Show me the princess.

652
00:49:09.643 --> 00:49:11.770
Perfect.

653
00:50:17.044 --> 00:50:19.380
Yeah, you know I like it like that.

654
00:50:20.839 --> 00:50:24.426
-Come on, baby. I said I like it.
-Donkey, wake up.

655
00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:26.136
-What?
-Wake up.

656
00:50:27.721 --> 00:50:29.640
-What?
-Morning.

657
00:50:29.723 --> 00:50:32.268
How do you like your eggs?

658
00:50:32.351 --> 00:50:36.063
-Good morning, Princess!
-What's all this about?

659
00:50:36.146 --> 00:50:40.359
You know, we kind of got off
to a bad start yesterday.

660
00:50:40.442 --> 00:50:45.823
I wanted to make it up to you.
I mean, after all, you did rescue me.

661
00:50:47.157 --> 00:50:49.118
"hanks.

662
00:50:50.244 --> 00:50:54.039
Well, eat up.
We've got a big day ahead of us.

663
00:50:59.837 --> 00:51:02.423
-Shrek!
-What? It's a compliment.

664
00:51:02.506 --> 00:51:05.259
Better out than in, I always say.

665
00:51:05.342 --> 00:51:08.220
Well, it's no way to behave
in front of a princess.

666
00:51:09.388 --> 00:51:12.016
-Thanks.
-She's as nasty as you are.

667
00:51:13.183 --> 00:51:16.729
You know,
you're not exactly what I expected.

668
00:51:16.812 --> 00:51:21.025
Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people
before you get to know them.

669
00:51:24.653 --> 00:51:27.364
Hey!

670
00:51:27.448 --> 00:51:29.199
Princess!

671
00:51:29.283 --> 00:51:31.744
Wait, wait. What are you doing?

672
00:51:31.827 --> 00:51:35.122
Be still, mon cherie,
for I am your saviour!

673
00:51:35.205 --> 00:51:39.543
And I am rescuing you from this green

674
00:51:39.877 --> 00:51:42.129
-beast.
-Hey!

675
00:51:42.212 --> 00:51:45.132
That's my princess! Go find your own!

676
00:51:45.215 --> 00:51:50.179
Please, monster!
Can't you see I'm a little busy here?

677
00:51:50.262 --> 00:51:53.349
Look, pal, I don't know
who you think you are!

678
00:51:53.432 --> 00:51:58.187
Of course! How rude.
Please, let me introduce myself.

679
00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:00.439
Merry Men!

680
00:52:07.404 --> 00:52:09.490
I steal from the rich
And give to the needy

681
00:52:09.573 --> 00:52:11.617
-He takes a wee percentage
-But I'm not greedy

682
00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:13.702
I rescue pretty damsels
Man, I'm good

683
00:52:13.786 --> 00:52:16.497
-What a guy, Monsieur Hood
-Break it down

684
00:52:20.459 --> 00:52:22.628
I like an honest fight
And a saucy little maid

685
00:52:22.711 --> 00:52:24.004
What he's basically saying is
He likes to get...

686
00:52:24.088 --> 00:52:25.089
Paid

687
00:52:25.172 --> 00:52:26.173
So

688
00:52:26.256 --> 00:52:27.841
When an ogre in the bush
Grabs a lady by the tush

689
00:52:27.925 --> 00:52:29.009
-That's bad
-That's bad

690
00:52:29.093 --> 00:52:30.344
-That's bad
-That's bad

691
00:52:30.427 --> 00:52:33.013
When a beauty's with a beast
It makes me awfully mad

692
00:52:33.097 --> 00:52:34.598
He's mad
He's really, really mad

693
00:52:34.682 --> 00:52:36.684
I'll take my blade
And ram it through your heart

694
00:52:36.767 --> 00:52:41.355
Keep your eyes on me, boys
'Cause I'm about to start

695
00:52:47.945 --> 00:52:50.906
-Man, that was annoying!
-You little...

696
00:53:19.518 --> 00:53:21.395
Shall we?

697
00:53:23.313 --> 00:53:24.690
Hold the phone.

698
00:53:26.692 --> 00:53:29.194
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now.

699
00:53:29.278 --> 00:53:31.280
-Where did that come from?
-What?

700
00:53:31.363 --> 00:53:34.575
That! Back there. That was amazing!

701
00:53:34.658 --> 00:53:36.118
Where did you learn that?

702
00:53:36.201 --> 00:53:39.455
Well, when one lives alone,

703
00:53:39.538 --> 00:53:42.291
one has to learn these things
in case there's a...

704
00:53:42.374 --> 00:53:45.002
-There's an arrow in your butt!
-What?

705
00:53:45.085 --> 00:53:48.672
-Would you look at that?
-No. This is all my fault.

706
00:53:48.755 --> 00:53:50.466
-I'm so sorry.
-Why? What's wrong?

707
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:53.093
-Shrek's hurt.
-Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt?

708
00:53:53.177 --> 00:53:54.428
No, Shrek's gonna die.

709
00:53:54.511 --> 00:53:55.929
Donkey, I'm okay.

710
00:53:56.013 --> 00:53:58.307
You can't do this to me, Shrek.
I'm too young for you to die.

711
00:53:58.390 --> 00:54:00.392
Keep your legs elevated.
Turn your head and cough.

712
00:54:00.476 --> 00:54:03.645
-Does anyone know the Heimlich?
-Donkey! Calm down.

713
00:54:03.729 --> 00:54:06.106
If you want to help Shrek,
run into the woods

714
00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:08.275
and find me a blue flower
with red thorns.

715
00:54:08.358 --> 00:54:11.111
Blue flower, red thorns.
Okay, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns.

716
00:54:11.195 --> 00:54:12.154
Blue flower, red thorns.

717
00:54:12.237 --> 00:54:15.407
Don't die, Shrek. And if you see
a long tunnel, stay away from the light!

718
00:54:15.532 --> 00:54:16.575
-Donkey!
-Donkey!

719
00:54:16.658 --> 00:54:18.535
Yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns.

720
00:54:18.744 --> 00:54:21.038
-Blue flower, red thorns.
-What are the flowers for?

721
00:54:21.121 --> 00:54:23.332
For getting rid of Donkey.

722
00:54:23.415 --> 00:54:25.667
Now, you hold still,
and I'll yank this thing out.

723
00:54:25.751 --> 00:54:27.628
Hey! Easy with the yankin'.

724
00:54:27.711 --> 00:54:31.256
-I'm sorry, but it has to come out.
-No, it's tender.

725
00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:32.799
Now, hold on.

726
00:54:32.883 --> 00:54:34.134
What you're doing is the opposite
of help.

727
00:54:34.218 --> 00:54:35.636
Don't move.

728
00:54:35.719 --> 00:54:37.554
-Look, look, time-out.
-Would you...

729
00:54:37.638 --> 00:54:42.226
Okay. What do you propose we do?

730
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:44.937
Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower,
red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.

731
00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.356
This would be so much easier
if I wasn't colour blind!

732
00:54:47.439 --> 00:54:49.525
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.

733
00:54:49.608 --> 00:54:51.693
Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'!

734
00:54:53.529 --> 00:54:55.656
Not good.

735
00:54:55.739 --> 00:54:59.243
Okay. Okay, I can nearly see the head.
It's just about...

736
00:55:05.332 --> 00:55:08.335
Nothing happened. We were just...

737
00:55:08.418 --> 00:55:11.588
Look, if you wanted to be alone,
all you had to do was ask, okay?

738
00:55:11.672 --> 00:55:15.217
Come on!
That's the last thing on my mind.

739
00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:18.971
The princess here was just...

740
00:55:23.767 --> 00:55:27.354
Hey, what's that? That's...
Is that blood?

741
00:56:45.974 --> 00:56:47.809
Hey!

742
00:56:58.153 --> 00:56:59.988
There it is, Princess.

743
00:57:00.947 --> 00:57:02.491
Your future awaits you.

744
00:57:02.574 --> 00:57:04.868
-That's Duloc?
-Yeah, I know.

745
00:57:04.951 --> 00:57:07.454
You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's
compensating for something,

746
00:57:07.537 --> 00:57:10.165
which I think means he has a really...

747
00:57:10.248 --> 00:57:12.167
I...

748
00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:15.962
-I guess we better move on.
-Sure. But, Shrek?

749
00:57:17.047 --> 00:57:19.716
I'm worried about Donkey.

750
00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:22.177
-What?
-I mean, look at him.

751
00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:25.263
-He doesn't look so good.
-What are you talking about? I'm fine.

752
00:57:25.347 --> 00:57:26.848
Well, that's what they always say,

753
00:57:26.932 --> 00:57:29.434
and then next thing you know,
you're on your back.

754
00:57:31.019 --> 00:57:32.938
-Dead.
-You know, she's right.

755
00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:35.857
You look awful.
Do you want to sit down?

756
00:57:35.941 --> 00:57:38.652
-You know, I'll make you some tea.
-I didn't want to say nothin',

757
00:57:38.735 --> 00:57:41.655
but I got this twinge in my neck,
and when I turn my head like this, look.

758
00:57:41.738 --> 00:57:43.615
-See?
-Who's hungry?

759
00:57:43.699 --> 00:57:46.034
-I'll find us some dinner.
-I'll get the firewood.

760
00:57:46.118 --> 00:57:50.747
Hey, where you goin'?
Man, I can't feel my toes!

761
00:57:50.831 --> 00:57:52.290
I don't have any toes!

762
00:57:53.583 --> 00:57:55.293
I think I need a hug.

763
00:58:02.926 --> 00:58:05.887
This is good. This is really good.

764
00:58:07.806 --> 00:58:10.100
-What is this?
-Weed rat.

765
00:58:10.809 --> 00:58:12.269
Rotisserie style.

766
00:58:12.352 --> 00:58:13.937
No kidding.

767
00:58:15.439 --> 00:58:16.773
Well, this is delicious.

768
00:58:16.857 --> 00:58:19.025
Well, they're also great in stews.

769
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:23.780
Now, I don't mean to brag,
but I make a mean weedrat stew.

770
00:58:27.617 --> 00:58:31.038
I guess I'll be dining
a little differently tomorrow night.

771
00:58:32.706 --> 00:58:36.501
Maybe you can
come visit me in the swamp sometime.

772
00:58:36.585 --> 00:58:38.628
I'll cook all kinds of stuff for you.

773
00:58:38.712 --> 00:58:42.591
Swamp-toad soup, fish-eye tartare,
you name it.

774
00:58:44.634 --> 00:58:45.969
I'd like that.

775
00:58:58.565 --> 00:59:02.486
-Princess?
-Yes, Shrek?

776
00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:07.866
I was wondering. Are you...

777
00:59:12.204 --> 00:59:14.331
Are you gonna eat that?

778
00:59:21.463 --> 00:59:24.883
Man, isn't this romantic?
Just look at that sunset.

779
00:59:24.966 --> 00:59:29.721
Sunset? No! I mean, it's late.
It's very late.

780
00:59:29.805 --> 00:59:31.306
-What?
-Wait a minute.

781
00:59:31.389 --> 00:59:33.308
I see what's goin' on here.

782
00:59:33.850 --> 00:59:36.311
-You're afraid of the dark, aren't you?
-Yes!

783
00:59:36.394 --> 00:59:40.148
Yes, that's it. I'm terrified.
You know what, I'd better go inside.

784
00:59:40.232 --> 00:59:43.944
Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to
be afraid of the dark, too, until...

785
00:59:44.027 --> 00:59:46.696
Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.

786
00:59:48.365 --> 00:59:51.701
-Good night.
-Good night.

787
00:59:55.539 --> 00:59:59.000
Now I really see what's goin' on here.

788
00:59:59.084 --> 01:00:00.794
What are you talkin' about?

789
01:00:00.877 --> 01:00:03.380
I don't even wanna hear it.
Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts.

790
01:00:03.463 --> 01:00:05.674
I know you two were
diggin' on each other. I could feel it.

791
01:00:05.757 --> 01:00:09.469
You're crazy.
I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.

792
01:00:09.553 --> 01:00:12.681
Come on, Shrek.
Wake up and smell the pheromones.

793
01:00:12.764 --> 01:00:15.433
-Just go on in and tell her how you feel.
-I...

794
01:00:15.517 --> 01:00:19.521
There's nothing to tell.
Besides, even if I did tell her that,

795
01:00:19.604 --> 01:00:25.110
well, you know...
And I'm not sayin' I do, 'cause I don't...

796
01:00:25.193 --> 01:00:27.654
She's a princess, and I'm...

797
01:00:28.196 --> 01:00:32.409
-An ogre?
-Yeah. An ogre.

798
01:00:33.451 --> 01:00:37.539
-Hey, where you goin'7
-To get more firewood.

799
01:00:56.349 --> 01:01:00.061
Princess? Princess Fiona?

800
01:01:05.233 --> 01:01:07.360
Princess, where are you?

801
01:01:12.991 --> 01:01:14.826
Princess?

802
01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:21.917
It's very spooky in here.
I ain't playing no games.

803
01:01:32.719 --> 01:01:34.930
-No! No!
-No, help!

804
01:01:35.013 --> 01:01:37.641
-Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
-No, it's okay. It's okay.

805
01:01:37.724 --> 01:01:40.810
-What did you do with the princess?
-Donkey, I'm the princess.

806
01:01:40.894 --> 01:01:43.271
It's me, in this body.

807
01:01:43.355 --> 01:01:45.899
Oh, my God! You ate the princess!

808
01:01:45.982 --> 01:01:47.734
-Can you hear me?
-Donkey!

809
01:01:47.817 --> 01:01:49.569
-Listen, keep breathing!
-No!

810
01:01:49.653 --> 01:01:52.864
I'll get you out of there!
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

811
01:01:52.948 --> 01:01:55.367
-Shrek!
-This is me.

812
01:02:00.622 --> 01:02:03.041
Princess?

813
01:02:03.124 --> 01:02:08.088
What happened to you?
You're different.

814
01:02:08.171 --> 01:02:10.799
-I'm ugly, okay?
-Well, yeah.

815
01:02:10.882 --> 01:02:13.927
Was it something that you ate? 'Cause
I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea.

816
01:02:14.010 --> 01:02:16.554
-You are what you eat, I said. Now...
-No.

817
01:02:16.638 --> 01:02:19.975
I've been this way
as long as I can remember.

818
01:02:20.058 --> 01:02:22.727
What do you mean? Look,
I ain't never seen you like this before.

819
01:02:22.811 --> 01:02:25.522
It only happens
when the sun goes down.

820
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:32.570
"By night one way, by day another.
This shall be the norm

821
01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:38.952
"until you find true love's first kiss
and then take love's true form."

822
01:02:41.329 --> 01:02:44.290
That's beautiful.
I didn't know you wrote poetry.

823
01:02:44.374 --> 01:02:47.419
It's a spell.

824
01:02:47.502 --> 01:02:52.007
When I was a little girl,
a witch cast a spell on me.

825
01:02:52.090 --> 01:02:54.384
Every night I become this,

826
01:02:55.343 --> 01:02:58.179
this horrible, ugly beast.

827
01:03:00.724 --> 01:03:05.645
I was placed in a tower to await the day
my true love would rescue me.

828
01:03:05.729 --> 01:03:08.440
That's why I have to marry
Lord Farquaad tomorrow

829
01:03:08.523 --> 01:03:13.778
before the sun sets
and he sees me like this.

830
01:03:16.031 --> 01:03:19.367
All right, all right. Calm down.
Look, it's not that bad.

831
01:03:19.451 --> 01:03:23.621
You're not that ugly.
Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly.

832
01:03:23.705 --> 01:03:26.708
But you only look like this at night.
Shrek's ugly 24-7.

833
01:03:26.791 --> 01:03:30.336
But, Donkey, I'm a princess,

834
01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:33.131
and this is not how a princess
is meant to look.

835
01:03:34.841 --> 01:03:37.719
Princess, how 'bout if you
don't marry Farquaad?

836
01:03:37.802 --> 01:03:39.679
have to.

837
01:03:39.763 --> 01:03:42.599
Only my true love's kiss
can break the spell.

838
01:03:43.099 --> 01:03:46.227
But, you know, you're kind of an ogre,

839
01:03:46.311 --> 01:03:49.564
and Shrek, well,
you got a lot in common.

840
01:03:50.273 --> 01:03:51.358
Shrek?

841
01:03:51.941 --> 01:03:55.362
Princess, I... How's it going, first of all?

842
01:03:55.445 --> 01:03:59.699
Good? Good for me, too. I'm okay.

843
01:03:59.783 --> 01:04:05.080
I saw this flower and thought of you
because it's pretty and...

844
01:04:05.163 --> 01:04:08.541
Well, I don't really like it,
but I thought you might like it

845
01:04:08.625 --> 01:04:13.421
'cause you're pretty.
But I like you anyway. I'd...

846
01:04:15.131 --> 01:04:18.718
I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go.

847
01:04:18.802 --> 01:04:21.012
I can't just marry whoever I want.

848
01:04:21.096 --> 01:04:23.556
Take a good look at me, Donkey.

849
01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:25.392
I mean, really,

850
01:04:25.475 --> 01:04:28.436
who could ever love a beast
so hideous and ugly?

851
01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.647
Princess and ugly don't go together.

852
01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:33.149
That's why I can't stay here with Shrek.

853
01:04:33.233 --> 01:04:37.654
My only chance to live happily
ever after is to marry my true love.

854
01:04:39.114 --> 01:04:42.992
Don't you see, Donkey?
That's just how it has to be.

855
01:04:45.495 --> 01:04:47.914
It's the only way to break the spell.

856
01:04:47.997 --> 01:04:49.833
You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.

857
01:04:49.916 --> 01:04:53.211
No! You can't breathe a word.
No one must ever know.

858
01:04:53.294 --> 01:04:55.839
What's the point of being able to talk
if you gotta keep secrets?

859
01:04:55.922 --> 01:04:58.383
Promise you won't tell. Promise!

860
01:04:58.466 --> 01:05:01.302
All right, all right. I won't tell him.
But you should.

861
01:05:02.178 --> 01:05:03.680
I just know before this is over,
I'm gonna need

862
01:05:03.763 --> 01:05:06.683
a whole lot of serious therapy.
Look at my eye twitch in'.

863
01:05:31.666 --> 01:05:35.128
I tell him, I tell him not.

864
01:05:36.546 --> 01:05:39.048
I tell him, I tell him not.

865
01:05:40.383 --> 01:05:41.718
tell him.

866
01:05:41.801 --> 01:05:46.556
Shrek! Shrek, there's something I want...

867
01:06:07.952 --> 01:06:09.537
Shrek.

868
01:06:10.955 --> 01:06:15.043
-Are you all right?
-Perfect! Never been better.

869
01:06:15.126 --> 01:06:18.379
I... I don't...
There's something I have to tell you.

870
01:06:18.671 --> 01:06:21.049
You don't have to tell me
anything, Princess.

871
01:06:21.132 --> 01:06:23.801
-I heard enough last night.
-You heard what I said?

872
01:06:23.885 --> 01:06:25.678
Every word.

873
01:06:25.762 --> 01:06:27.180
I thought you'd understand.

874
01:06:27.263 --> 01:06:29.015
understand.

875
01:06:29.098 --> 01:06:33.144
Like you said, "Who could
love a hideous, ugly beast?"

876
01:06:34.103 --> 01:06:35.897
But I thought that wouldn't matter to you.

877
01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:38.024
Yeah? Well, it does.

878
01:06:40.068 --> 01:06:42.779
Right on time.

879
01:06:42.862 --> 01:06:45.573
Princess, I've brought you
a little something.

880
01:06:51.246 --> 01:06:53.581
What'd I miss? What'd I miss?

881
01:06:53.665 --> 01:06:56.292
Who said that?
Couldn't have been a donkey.

882
01:06:57.669 --> 01:06:59.796
Princess Fiona.

883
01:06:59.879 --> 01:07:02.924
As promised. Now, hand it over.

884
01:07:03.007 --> 01:07:07.512
Very well, ogre. The deed
to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed.

885
01:07:07.595 --> 01:07:11.015
Take it and go
before I change my mind.

886
01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:14.310
Forgive me, Princess, for startling you,

887
01:07:14.394 --> 01:07:16.813
but you startled me,

888
01:07:16.896 --> 01:07:20.566
for I have never seen
such a radiant beauty before.

889
01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:23.736
I am Lord Farquaad.

890
01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:27.657
Lord Farquaad? No, no.

891
01:07:28.658 --> 01:07:31.494
Forgive me, my lord,
for I was just saying a short

892
01:07:34.831 --> 01:07:36.207
farewell.

893
01:07:36.291 --> 01:07:41.296
That is so sweet. You don't have
to waste good manners on the ogre.

894
01:07:41.379 --> 01:07:43.506
It's not like it has feelings.

895
01:07:43.590 --> 01:07:46.968
No, you're right. It doesn't.

896
01:07:47.051 --> 01:07:51.055
Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair,
flawless Fiona.

897
01:07:51.139 --> 01:07:54.392
I ask your hand in marriage.

898
01:07:54.475 --> 01:07:58.354
Will you be the perfect bride
for the perfect groom?

899
01:08:03.443 --> 01:08:07.905
Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Nothing would make...

900
01:08:07.989 --> 01:08:11.242
Excellent! I'll start the plans,
for tomorrow we wed!

901
01:08:11.326 --> 01:08:15.580
No! I mean, why wait?

902
01:08:15.663 --> 01:08:19.375
Let's get married today before sunset.

903
01:08:19.459 --> 01:08:22.170
Anxious, are we? You're right.

904
01:08:22.253 --> 01:08:26.174
The sooner, the better.
There's so much to do!

905
01:08:26.257 --> 01:08:28.593
There's the caterer,
the cake, the band, the guest list.

906
01:08:28.676 --> 01:08:32.096
Captain, round up some guests!

907
01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:34.682
Fare thee well, ogre.

908
01:08:34.766 --> 01:08:37.018
Shrek, what are you doing?
You're letting her get away.

909
01:08:37.101 --> 01:08:38.603
Yeah? So what?

910
01:08:38.686 --> 01:08:40.563
Shrek, there's something about her
you don't know.

911
01:08:40.646 --> 01:08:42.440
Look, I talked to her last night. She's...

912
01:08:42.523 --> 01:08:46.986
I know you talked to her last night.
You're great pals, aren't ya?

913
01:08:47.070 --> 01:08:50.406
Now, if you two are such good friends,
why don't you follow her home?

914
01:08:50.490 --> 01:08:52.450
Shrek, I wanna go with you.

915
01:08:52.533 --> 01:08:55.495
I told you, didn't I?
You're not coming home with me.

916
01:08:55.578 --> 01:08:59.666
I live alone!
My swamp! Me! Nobody else!

917
01:08:59.749 --> 01:09:01.709
Understand? Nobody!

918
01:09:01.793 --> 01:09:06.631
Especially useless, pathetic,
annoying, talking donkeys!

919
01:09:06.714 --> 01:09:09.884
-But I thought...
-Yeah. You know what?

920
01:09:09.967 --> 01:09:11.636
You thought wrong!

921
01:09:13.930 --> 01:09:15.306
Shrek.

922
01:11:36.614 --> 01:11:40.660
Donkey? What are you doing?

923
01:11:40.743 --> 01:11:43.871
I would think, of all people, you would
recognise a wall when you see one.

924
01:11:43.955 --> 01:11:45.623
Well, yeah.

925
01:11:45.706 --> 01:11:49.126
But the wall's supposed
to go around my swamp, not through it.

926
01:11:49.210 --> 01:11:52.004
It is around your half.
See, that's your half, and this is my half.

927
01:11:52.088 --> 01:11:54.715
Your half.

928
01:11:54.924 --> 01:11:57.426
Yes, my half.
I helped rescue the princess.

929
01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:59.637
I did half the work, I get half the booty.

930
01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:03.266
Now, hand me that big, old rock,
the one that looks like your head.

931
01:12:03.349 --> 01:12:05.643
-Back off!
-No, you back off.

932
01:12:05.726 --> 01:12:08.020
-This is my swamp!
-Our swamp.

933
01:12:08.104 --> 01:12:09.355
-Let go, Donkey!
-You let go.

934
01:12:09.438 --> 01:12:11.524
-Stubborn jackass!
-Smelly ogre.

935
01:12:11.607 --> 01:12:13.818
Fine!

936
01:12:13.901 --> 01:12:15.778
Hey, come back here.
I'm not through with you yet.

937
01:12:15.862 --> 01:12:17.530
Well, I'm through with you.

938
01:12:17.613 --> 01:12:20.658
You know, with you, it's always,
"Me, me, me!"

939
01:12:20.741 --> 01:12:25.538
Well, guess what! Now it's my turn!
So, you just shut up and pay attention!

940
01:12:25.621 --> 01:12:27.415
You are mean to me.

941
01:12:27.498 --> 01:12:30.209
You insult me and you don't
appreciate anything that I do!

942
01:12:30.293 --> 01:12:32.879
You're always pushing me around
or pushing me away.

943
01:12:32.962 --> 01:12:37.258
Yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad,
how come you came back?

944
01:12:37.341 --> 01:12:40.553
Because that's what friends do!
They forgive each other!

945
01:12:40.886 --> 01:12:43.848
Yeah. You're right, Donkey.

946
01:12:43.931 --> 01:12:48.144
I forgive you
for stabbin' me in the back!

947
01:12:48.728 --> 01:12:52.148
You're so wrapped up in layers,
onion boy,

948
01:12:52.231 --> 01:12:53.649
you're afraid of your own feelings.

949
01:12:53.733 --> 01:12:54.817
Go away!

950
01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:57.486
See, there you are, doing it again
just like you did to Fiona.

951
01:12:57.570 --> 01:12:59.864
All she ever do was like you,
maybe even love you.

952
01:12:59.947 --> 01:13:04.368
Love me?
She said I was ugly, a hideous creature.

953
01:13:04.452 --> 01:13:06.120
I heard the two of you talking.

954
01:13:06.329 --> 01:13:10.124
She wasn't talkin' about you.
She was talkin' about somebody else.

955
01:13:13.044 --> 01:13:16.213
She wasn't talking about me?

956
01:13:16.297 --> 01:13:17.840
Well, then who was she talking about?

957
01:13:17.923 --> 01:13:21.344
No way. I ain't saying anything.
You don't wanna listen to me, right?

958
01:13:21.427 --> 01:13:24.138
-Right? No!
-Donkey!

959
01:13:24.221 --> 01:13:27.725
Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right?

960
01:13:34.357 --> 01:13:36.150
I'm sorry.

961
01:13:36.233 --> 01:13:40.488
I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

962
01:13:41.697 --> 01:13:43.366
Can you forgive me?

963
01:13:46.077 --> 01:13:47.953
Hey, that's what friends are for, right?

964
01:13:48.037 --> 01:13:52.541
-Right. Friends?
-Friends.

965
01:13:53.376 --> 01:13:57.922
So, what did Fiona say about me?

966
01:13:58.547 --> 01:14:01.759
What are you asking me for?
Why don't you just go ask her?

967
01:14:01.842 --> 01:14:04.303
The wedding!
We'll never make it in time.

968
01:14:04.387 --> 01:14:09.058
Never fear, for where there's a will,
there's a way, and I have a way.

969
01:14:14.105 --> 01:14:16.565
Donkey?

970
01:14:16.649 --> 01:14:19.110
I guess it's just my animal magnetism.

971
01:14:21.737 --> 01:14:23.030
-Come here, you.
-All right, all right.

972
01:14:23.114 --> 01:14:25.157
Don't get all slobbery.
No one likes a kiss-ass.

973
01:14:25.241 --> 01:14:27.785
All right, hop on and hold on tight.

974
01:14:27.868 --> 01:14:29.954
I haven't had a chance
to install the seat belts yet.

975
01:15:02.486 --> 01:15:04.864
People of Duloc,

976
01:15:05.823 --> 01:15:10.453
we gather here today to bear witness

977
01:15:10.536 --> 01:15:14.999
-to the union of our new king.
-Excuse me.

978
01:15:15.082 --> 01:15:18.294
Could we just skip ahead to the "I do's"?

979
01:15:18.377 --> 01:15:19.795
Go on.

980
01:15:24.967 --> 01:15:28.345
Go ahead, have some fun. If we
need you, I'll whistle. How about that?

981
01:15:31.474 --> 01:15:33.142
Shrek, wait, wait! Hey! Wait a minute!

982
01:15:33.225 --> 01:15:35.728
-You wanna do this right, don't you?
-What are you talking about?

983
01:15:35.811 --> 01:15:37.354
There's a line you gotta wait for.

984
01:15:37.438 --> 01:15:39.982
The priest is gonna say,
"Speak now or forever hold your peace."

985
01:15:40.065 --> 01:15:42.401
And that's when you say, "I object!"

986
01:15:42.485 --> 01:15:44.069
don't have time for this!

987
01:15:44.153 --> 01:15:46.072
Wait. What are you doing?
Listen to me!

988
01:15:46.155 --> 01:15:47.823
-Look, you love this woman, don't you?
-Yes.

989
01:15:47.907 --> 01:15:49.325
-You wanna hold her?
-Yes.

990
01:15:49.408 --> 01:15:50.576
-Please her?
-Yes!

991
01:15:50.659 --> 01:15:54.330
Then you got to, got to try
a little tenderness

992
01:15:54.413 --> 01:15:55.706
The chicks love that romantic crap!

993
01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:59.001
All right! Cut it out.
When does this guy say the line?

994
01:15:59.835 --> 01:16:01.253
We gotta check it out.

995
01:16:01.337 --> 01:16:05.424
-And so, by the power vested in me...
-What do you see?

996
01:16:05.508 --> 01:16:07.093
"he whole town's in there.

997
01:16:07.176 --> 01:16:10.304
-I now pronounce you husband...
-They're at the altar.

998
01:16:10.387 --> 01:16:13.641
-...and wife, king and queen.
-Mother Fletcher! He already said it.

999
01:16:13.724 --> 01:16:15.559
For the love of Pete!

1000
01:16:17.269 --> 01:16:19.647
I object!

1001
01:16:19.730 --> 01:16:23.484
-Shrek?
-Now what does he want?

1002
01:16:27.071 --> 01:16:31.033
Hi, everyone.
Havin' a good time, are ya?

1003
01:16:31.116 --> 01:16:33.285
I love Duloc, first of all. Very clean.

1004
01:16:33.369 --> 01:16:34.787
What are you doing here?

1005
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:37.998
Really, it's rude enough
being alive when no one wants you,

1006
01:16:38.082 --> 01:16:41.418
-but showing up uninvited to a wedding.
-Fiona!

1007
01:16:41.502 --> 01:16:44.505
-I need to talk to you.
-Now you wanna talk?

1008
01:16:44.588 --> 01:16:47.424
Well, it's a little late for that,
so if you'll excuse me.

1009
01:16:47.508 --> 01:16:50.010
-But you can't marry him.
-And why not?

1010
01:16:50.094 --> 01:16:54.098
Because, because he's just
marrying you so he can be king.

1011
01:16:54.181 --> 01:16:56.600
Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.

1012
01:16:56.684 --> 01:17:00.020
-He's not your true love.
-And what do you know about true love?

1013
01:17:00.104 --> 01:17:03.148
Well, I...

1014
01:17:03.232 --> 01:17:06.068
-I mean...
-This is precious.

1015
01:17:07.403 --> 01:17:10.823
The ogre has fallen in love
with the princess!

1016
01:17:10.906 --> 01:17:12.241
Good Lord.

1017
01:17:13.534 --> 01:17:15.160
An ogre and a princess!

1018
01:17:20.791 --> 01:17:23.460
Shrek, is this true?

1019
01:17:24.712 --> 01:17:27.339
Who cares? It's preposterous!

1020
01:17:27.423 --> 01:17:30.968
Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away
from our "happily ever after."

1021
01:17:31.051 --> 01:17:33.095
Now, kiss me!

1022
01:17:37.725 --> 01:17:41.061
"By night one way, by day another."

1023
01:17:43.564 --> 01:17:45.274
I wanted to show you before.

1024
01:18:09.048 --> 01:18:12.927
Well, that explains a lot.

1025
01:18:13.552 --> 01:18:16.847
It's disgusting!

1026
01:18:16.931 --> 01:18:18.724
Guards! Guards!

1027
01:18:18.807 --> 01:18:22.186
I order you to get that
out of my sight now! Get them!

1028
01:18:22.269 --> 01:18:23.729
-Get them both!
-No, no!

1029
01:18:23.812 --> 01:18:25.648
This hocus-pocus alters nothing.

1030
01:18:25.731 --> 01:18:28.776
This marriage is binding,
and that makes me king!

1031
01:18:28.859 --> 01:18:31.153
-See? See?
-No, let go of me! Shrek!

1032
01:18:31.237 --> 01:18:32.947
-No!
-Don't just stand there, you morons.

1033
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:35.115
Get out of my way! Fiona!

1034
01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:43.999
I'll make you regret the day we met.
I'll see you drawn and quartered!

1035
01:18:44.083 --> 01:18:46.835
-You'll beg for death to save you!
-No! Shrek!

1036
01:18:46.919 --> 01:18:49.213
And as for you, my wife...

1037
01:18:49.296 --> 01:18:50.297
Fiona!

1038
01:18:50.381 --> 01:18:53.300
...I'll have you locked back in that tower
for the rest of your days!

1039
01:18:53.676 --> 01:18:59.098
I am king! I will have order!
I will have perfection! I will have...

1040
01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:08.232
All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon
here, and I'm not afraid to use it.

1041
01:19:09.650 --> 01:19:11.443
I'm a donkey on the edge!

1042
01:19:15.489 --> 01:19:17.866
Celebrity marriages.
They never last, do they?

1043
01:19:21.203 --> 01:19:22.538
Go ahead, Shrek.

1044
01:19:24.915 --> 01:19:26.834
Fiona?

1045
01:19:26.917 --> 01:19:28.711
Yes, Shrek?

1046
01:19:29.169 --> 01:19:32.798
I love you.

1047
01:19:33.882 --> 01:19:35.592
Really?

1048
01:19:36.969 --> 01:19:38.178
Really, really.

1049
01:19:40.139 --> 01:19:41.724
I love you, too.

1050
01:19:50.733 --> 01:19:53.736
"Until you find true love's first kiss

1051
01:19:53.819 --> 01:19:57.072
"and then take love's true form."

1052
01:20:20.929 --> 01:20:23.849
"Take love's true form.
Take love's true form."

1053
01:20:30.773 --> 01:20:31.982
Fiona?

1054
01:20:35.194 --> 01:20:38.864
Fiona. Are you all right?

1055
01:20:40.949 --> 01:20:43.035
Well, yes.

1056
01:20:43.118 --> 01:20:47.456
But I don't understand.
I'm supposed to be beautiful.

1057
01:20:50.667 --> 01:20:52.127
But you are beautiful.

1058
01:20:55.297 --> 01:20:57.091
I was hoping this would be
a happy ending.

1059
01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:48.976
God bless us, every one.

1060
01:22:58.795 --> 01:23:01.506
That's funny.

1061
01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:04.134
can't breathe. I can't breathe.
