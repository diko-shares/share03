00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,716
Previously on "Splitting Up Together"...

2
00:00:01,722 --> 00:00:03,718
- We're pulling the plug.
- And the kids know,

3
00:00:03,724 --> 00:00:04,959
and they're okay.

4
00:00:04,965 --> 00:00:07,316
And things really aren't
gonna be that different.

5
00:00:07,322 --> 00:00:10,095
The on-duty parent will live in here,

6
00:00:10,101 --> 00:00:12,278
taking care of the kids,
living a rich, full life.

7
00:00:12,284 --> 00:00:14,482
That's right. And the off-duty
parent will be living right

8
00:00:14,488 --> 00:00:16,113
here in the garage.

9
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:17,886
I don't want Lena dating again.

10
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:21,309
- I want her back together with Martin.
- We haven't had sex in two years.

11
00:00:22,292 --> 00:00:25,197
Let me give you my card, here.

12
00:00:25,203 --> 00:00:27,599
Are you... sending out vibes?

13
00:00:27,605 --> 00:00:30,009
- Vibes?
- Are we vibing?

14
00:00:30,622 --> 00:00:32,887
_

15
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:38,324
Okay, so, Milo has a
book report due Monday,

16
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,832
Mason needs to practice piano.

17
00:00:39,838 --> 00:00:41,411
At least an hour... that was the deal.

18
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:44,211
- Okay.
- And Mae needs to take vitamin D.

19
00:00:44,217 --> 00:00:46,006
The doctor said she's deficient.

20
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:47,787
There's some on the
counter by the microwave.

21
00:00:47,793 --> 00:00:49,036
She's deficient?

22
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:51,352
How's that even possible? We
live in Southern California.

23
00:00:51,358 --> 00:00:52,662
Have you met Mae?

24
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,053
What are you doing?

25
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,332
Taking the comforter
with me to the garage.

26
00:00:56,338 --> 00:00:58,916
Um, no, you're not.

27
00:00:59,187 --> 00:01:01,404
I just spent a week in
solitary confinement.

28
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,280
I've been looking forward to a real bed,

29
00:01:03,286 --> 00:01:06,393
complete with the
comfort of a comforter.

30
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,208
Ooh! It's so cozy!

31
00:01:08,214 --> 00:01:10,114
You don't even care about blankets.

32
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,412
- You kick them off at night.
- Yeah, but one has to be there

33
00:01:12,418 --> 00:01:13,711
in order for me to kick it off.

34
00:01:13,717 --> 00:01:15,528
And don't tell me that
I can kick off a quilt,

35
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,623
because I've tried it,
sister. It didn't work!

36
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:19,412
Uh, I'll get you a different blanket!

37
00:01:19,418 --> 00:01:21,086
- You're ridiculous.
- You're ridiculous!

38
00:01:21,092 --> 00:01:23,215
That comforter is property
of the master bedroom.

39
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:24,742
Whoever sleeps here gets to enjoy

40
00:01:24,748 --> 00:01:28,118
full custody of that
blanket and the children.

41
00:01:28,124 --> 00:01:30,032
- Come here!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

42
00:01:30,038 --> 00:01:33,007
- Stop it! Martin!
- Rahh! Ow!

43
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,865
It wasn't always like this.

44
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:36,453
When things were good,

45
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:38,030
we slept under the same blanket.

46
00:01:38,036 --> 00:01:41,475
But once you introduce that
crappy second blanket, boy...

47
00:01:41,481 --> 00:01:43,860
Yeah, the marriage
is pretty much over.

48
00:01:44,657 --> 00:01:45,862
God!

49
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:47,767
- Oh! Fine!
- Ow!

50
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:50,264
- Uh!
- Let the baby have his blankie.

51
00:01:50,447 --> 00:01:51,751
Sank you!

52
00:01:53,424 --> 00:01:54,624
Hey.

53
00:01:54,797 --> 00:01:57,727
I'm sorry. I'll see you next week.

54
00:01:59,915 --> 00:02:03,014
- Thank you. I appreciate the...
- I was talking to the blanket.

Do I need to get you
a crying bikini, huh?

64
00:02:34,214 --> 00:02:35,722
- Sexist.
- Ow! Ow!

65
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:37,908
Beg pardon?

66
00:02:37,914 --> 00:02:40,295
You're a cisgendered sexist,
and you're raising two more

67
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:43,280
by continuing to perpetuate
negative stereotypes.

68
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,780
- Wha?
- "Crying bikini"?

69
00:02:45,786 --> 00:02:48,688
Because that's what girls
wear, and only girls cry?

70
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:51,090
No, no, no. The crying bikini is a...

71
00:02:51,306 --> 00:02:53,518
it's a unisex garment, right?

72
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:56,372
Oh, come on.

73
00:02:56,378 --> 00:02:58,890
Come on. I'm not sexist.
I'm your dad. I...

74
00:02:58,896 --> 00:03:01,258
always treated you
kids exactly the same.

75
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,464
Really?

76
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,378
Because you never wrestle with me.

77
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,909
You want to wrestle?

78
00:03:07,217 --> 00:03:09,443
- Sure.
- Aww, she's gonna get it.

79
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:12,521
- You asked for it. Rah! Uh!
- Oof!

80
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:14,754
- Ooh!
- Oh, my God.

81
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,936
- Oh, my God. Are you okay, honey?
- I'm okay.

82
00:03:16,942 --> 00:03:20,307
She just stood there like a drunk.

83
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,684
- Is it over?
- Well, I mean, it can be.

84
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,289
Technically, you're supposed
to, you know, struggle now,

85
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:28,109
- try to get free.
- He's not even torturing her.

86
00:03:28,115 --> 00:03:30,309
Come on, Dad. What
about the rib cruncher?

87
00:03:30,315 --> 00:03:32,032
Yeah. That's your signature move.

88
00:03:32,038 --> 00:03:34,710
You want your ribs... crunched?

89
00:03:35,723 --> 00:03:36,932
Why not?

90
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:40,620
Okay. Ah! The rib
cruncher... crunchin'...

91
00:03:40,626 --> 00:03:42,120
G-g-g-g-g... uh!

92
00:03:43,187 --> 00:03:45,409
She's impervious.

93
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:47,356
Okay, that's it. We're done.

94
00:03:47,362 --> 00:03:49,133
Wrestling's over. Come on. Everyone. Go.

95
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:50,636
- Aw.
- Go. Go read a book.

96
00:03:50,642 --> 00:03:53,057
No fair. Girls ruin everything.

97
00:03:53,063 --> 00:03:54,856
Hey, hey. Milo, get
over here. Come here.

98
00:03:55,358 --> 00:03:56,558
Come here.

99
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:59,984
Don't say, "Girls ruin everything."

100
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,476
It-it's not cool to
generalize about all girls.

101
00:04:04,072 --> 00:04:06,173
Say, "Mae ruins everything."

102
00:04:06,358 --> 00:04:08,190
I appreciate that.

103
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:12,927
I'm sorry. Is it, like,
really damp in here?

104
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:14,521
It is. Here.

105
00:04:14,618 --> 00:04:15,896
This should help.

106
00:04:18,515 --> 00:04:20,126
Huh. Look at those guys.

107
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:22,902
- Are those...
- Centipedes, yeah.

108
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,405
I've come to know
their habits quite well.

109
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,677
They are a moisture-loving lot.

110
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:31,009
But these boys flew a little
too close to the sun, am I right?

111
00:04:32,466 --> 00:04:34,480
- I'm sorry.
- What is it?

112
00:04:34,486 --> 00:04:36,364
I just hate seeing you like this?

113
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,481
Like what? I'm happy.

114
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,551
- You can't be.
- But I am.

115
00:04:40,557 --> 00:04:42,714
Camille, this is not that bad.

116
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,353
And besides, it's only for a week.

117
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:48,090
Actually, it's 26 weeks, if
the arrangement lasts a year.

118
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:50,059
Well, I could see it
lasting more than a year.

119
00:04:50,065 --> 00:04:52,769
Honestly, I look forward
to my garage weeks.

120
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:55,691
This is my time to focus on myself.

121
00:04:55,954 --> 00:04:59,076
I had an epiphany last
week in the main house.

122
00:04:59,974 --> 00:05:02,495
You know how our shower
has that great big skylight?

123
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,440
- No.
- Well, it does.

124
00:05:04,446 --> 00:05:07,034
And I always insisted
that we never open it

125
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,253
because of the squirrels
that run across our roof.

126
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:10,459
It drove Martin crazy.

127
00:05:10,465 --> 00:05:12,229
He said, "What's the
point of having a skylight

128
00:05:12,235 --> 00:05:13,849
if we never get to open it?"

129
00:05:16,053 --> 00:05:17,853
I had a head full of shampoo...

130
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,238
I'm gonna kill him.

131
00:05:19,346 --> 00:05:20,839
...and I was about to
get out of the shower

132
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:22,642
to close the thing when...

133
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:27,339
You wanna go?

134
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,017
Don't even think about coming down here.

135
00:05:30,023 --> 00:05:31,414
I will kill a squirrel.

136
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:34,008
And in that moment,
I realized something.

137
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:36,814
That you were right and Martin
should have listened to you all along?

138
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,220
No. That squirrel is the only man

139
00:05:39,226 --> 00:05:41,048
who has seen me naked in two years...

140
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:42,486
and he's not even a man.

141
00:05:44,249 --> 00:05:46,032
This is my week to change that.

142
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:57,326
- You're not gonna eat that, bro.
- I am, bro.

143
00:05:57,332 --> 00:05:59,223
- Bro, I'm taking it.
- Come at me, bro.

144
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:01,724
- Don't say "come at me, bro" to your bro, bro.
- Here.

145
00:06:02,203 --> 00:06:04,537
Mae, you okay?

146
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:08,801
Yeah, just... a little too much
bro-energy, if I'm being honest.

147
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:11,541
Mmm, well, they are... actual bros.

148
00:06:11,547 --> 00:06:13,399
And I guess I didn't get
the memo about this being

149
00:06:13,405 --> 00:06:16,090
a shirtless dinner, or
I would have joined in.

150
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:17,960
- Gross.
- My point exactly.

151
00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:20,348
Ditto for the recent no-flushing trend.

152
00:06:20,354 --> 00:06:23,042
- Hey, if it's yellow, let it mellow.
- Ah, that's a good boy.

153
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:24,840
How is that a "good boy"?

154
00:06:24,846 --> 00:06:27,426
Mae, when you're a mom,
you can make the rules,

155
00:06:27,432 --> 00:06:29,239
but I'm playing Mom this week.

156
00:06:29,245 --> 00:06:31,354
And why are you "playing Mom"?

157
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,463
Because you're taking care
of your kids and your house?

158
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:36,448
He's not really taking
care of his house.

159
00:06:36,454 --> 00:06:38,463
I'm literally only shirtless
'cause there's no clean laundry.

160
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:40,268
Shut up, traitors!

161
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,434
Do you want clean laundry
or the Master Sword in Zelda?

162
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,640
I can't do both.

163
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,534
And besides...

164
00:06:45,747 --> 00:06:47,823
there was a whole movie
made about it in the '80s.

165
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:49,237
It was called "Mr. Mom."

166
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,647
You know what a better name
for that movie would have been?

167
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:53,031
"Dad."

168
00:06:54,422 --> 00:06:55,919
- She's not wrong.
- Yep.

169
00:06:55,925 --> 00:06:58,403
- All right, guys. Zip it.
- He...

170
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:05,786
_

171
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:08,723
_

172
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,003
Who are you texting?

173
00:07:10,316 --> 00:07:11,516
Mae.

174
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:13,239
Why are you lying in wait?

175
00:07:13,245 --> 00:07:17,731
Sorry, but... Mom, I can't
handle Dad weeks. I just can't.

176
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:21,116
Nobody brushes and nobody
flushes, and not to tattle,

177
00:07:21,122 --> 00:07:24,649
but Dad never moves the wet clothes
from the washer into the dryer.

178
00:07:25,032 --> 00:07:26,960
Can I please just
stay out here with you?

179
00:07:27,044 --> 00:07:28,559
Oh, sweetie.

180
00:07:28,746 --> 00:07:30,427
You know, I would love that,

181
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:33,188
but I think your dad
would be heartbroken.

182
00:07:33,811 --> 00:07:37,371
I mean, he really looks
forward to his weeks with you.

183
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,775
I mean, your dad adores you.

184
00:07:40,973 --> 00:07:43,776
You know who's a real pain
in the ass? Your daughter.

185
00:07:43,782 --> 00:07:45,465
I mean, when did she get so judgmental?

186
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:47,778
Seriously, Mae can go topple
the patriarchy someplace else,

187
00:07:47,784 --> 00:07:49,378
because I am her actual father,

188
00:07:49,384 --> 00:07:51,548
and the next time that
girl rolls her eyes at me,

189
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,754
I'm gonna tell her...

190
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,136
The future is female?

191
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:01,822
W-Well, what the hell is wrong with her?

192
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:03,327
Maybe she feels outnumbered.

193
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,537
Well, I'm sure Mason feels
the same way during your week.

194
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:07,418
But he's not outnumbered. He has Milo...

195
00:08:07,424 --> 00:08:10,433
Oh, Milo doesn't count. He's,
like, a little half-human.

196
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:12,435
Look. Mae is smart.

197
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:13,688
And insightful.

198
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:16,061
- And she's also...
- Not my daughter?

199
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,064
- I was gonna say "a feminist."
- 'Cause you can tell me

200
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,749
- if she's not my daughter.
- Mae is a budding feminist,

201
00:08:20,755 --> 00:08:23,968
- and as such, she is questioning everything.
- Okay.

202
00:08:23,974 --> 00:08:27,391
So, maybe if you just took a
little bit more of an interest

203
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:28,868
in the things that she cares about,

204
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:31,095
- the way you do with the boys.
- Oh god, here we go again.

205
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,963
If you don't want my advice,

206
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:35,059
I've got a whole shelf
full of parenting books...

207
00:08:35,454 --> 00:08:37,341
- and cookbooks.
- So, you're just gonna use this

208
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:39,233
as an excuse to push your own agenda

209
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:42,131
- once again. Oh, just admit it, Lena,
- You came knocking on my door.

210
00:08:42,137 --> 00:08:44,717
it kills you that I don't
parent the way you do.

211
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:47,254
And yet, here I stand... not dead.

212
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,685
And clearly, my rules
don't govern your world,

213
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:51,070
- Right.
- hence the skylight.

214
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:53,549
Oh, the skylight?

215
00:08:53,555 --> 00:08:54,856
The skylight!

216
00:08:54,862 --> 00:08:57,856
Oh, you're just angry because
you can't block my sunshine.

217
00:08:57,862 --> 00:09:00,380
I was eye-[BLEEP] by a squirrel!

218
00:09:01,065 --> 00:09:02,265
Whoa.

219
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,554
- I didn't mean to block his sunshine,
- _

220
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,259
but somehow, I'm always the bad guy.

221
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:08,954
- Yeah.
- "Yeah"?

222
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,750
Look, I realize that

223
00:09:10,756 --> 00:09:12,945
things between you
two are complicated...

224
00:09:12,951 --> 00:09:14,516
They're not complicated. They're over.

225
00:09:14,522 --> 00:09:17,532
...but then again, the devil you know...

226
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:20,356
But then again, who wants
to be married to the devil?

227
00:09:20,362 --> 00:09:22,528
You should've heard the way
he talked to me last night.

228
00:09:22,534 --> 00:09:24,239
He blames me for everything,

229
00:09:24,245 --> 00:09:26,239
including his relationship with Mae.

230
00:09:26,245 --> 00:09:28,629
But on the plus side, not a squirrel.

231
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,504
Fine, I'll give you "not a squirrel."

232
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,503
But need I remind you, Martin's dating.

233
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:36,028
We have no way of knowing
whether he is or isn't dating.

234
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:38,614
Well, regardless, I am more interested

235
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,411
in the cute doctor I've been texting.

236
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:41,801
What cute doctor?

237
00:09:41,807 --> 00:09:44,687
The one who treated Mason. I
asked him out for drinks tonight.

238
00:09:44,858 --> 00:09:47,188
This is my mom's, but I'm allowed.

239
00:09:47,194 --> 00:09:48,897
- I know, Toby.
- So, what?

240
00:09:48,903 --> 00:09:51,880
You just use emojis
now, like some tween?

241
00:09:51,886 --> 00:09:53,341
- The heart-eyes one...
- _

242
00:09:53,347 --> 00:09:55,126
- The tongue-out one...
- _

243
00:09:55,132 --> 00:09:57,422
- The snorting-coke one...
- That's not coke.

244
00:09:57,428 --> 00:09:59,190
That is a ton of coke.

245
00:09:59,825 --> 00:10:01,454
Okay, relax, chip reader.

246
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,433
We all waited for you, and
now, the second you're ready,

247
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:04,753
Toby's supposed to jump?!

248
00:10:06,295 --> 00:10:08,387
I thought you'd be happy for me.

249
00:10:08,393 --> 00:10:10,201
- Well, I'm not.
- _

250
00:10:10,674 --> 00:10:13,879
I'm sorry. I just really miss
the way things used to be.

251
00:10:13,885 --> 00:10:15,270
Well, I don't,

252
00:10:15,276 --> 00:10:17,552
okay? I don't want a platonic marriage.

253
00:10:17,558 --> 00:10:19,762
I want to be with someone who's into me.

254
00:10:19,768 --> 00:10:22,969
I want to be with someone who
wants to tear my clothes off.

255
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:27,322
Are you the type of person
who would let someone...

256
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:29,037
tear their clothes off?

257
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:34,206
Well, obviously not my high-end pieces.

258
00:10:35,987 --> 00:10:37,697
_

259
00:10:43,262 --> 00:10:44,662
"Gender Wars"?

260
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:47,214
- Why are you looking at Mom's books?
- Oh.

261
00:10:47,963 --> 00:10:51,119
Hey, man. Uh, I'm just
doing a little research on

262
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,377
your sister.

263
00:10:54,098 --> 00:10:55,431
And your mom.

264
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:58,169
- And just women in general. You know.
- _

265
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,479
- Care to join me?
- I'm good.

266
00:11:02,676 --> 00:11:05,303
I mean, it'd be one thing if she
were dating to get back at him,

267
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:07,576
but I don't think
she's doing it for him.

268
00:11:07,582 --> 00:11:09,189
I think she's doing it for her.

269
00:11:09,195 --> 00:11:10,431
Which means...

270
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:11,719
it's really over.

271
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,430
That's a fair assumption.

272
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:19,125
- I don't understand your attitude.
- What attitude?

273
00:11:19,131 --> 00:11:21,525
How can you take this
whole thing just lying down?

274
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:23,431
Take what lying down?
Someone else's divorce?

275
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:25,251
Well, if it could happen to them,

276
00:11:25,257 --> 00:11:27,236
- it could happen to us.
- It's not gonna happen to us.

277
00:11:27,242 --> 00:11:28,953
- Well, how do you know?
- 'Cause if you ever tried to leave,

278
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,829
I would hold you captive like an orca.

279
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:32,302
- That's illegal.
- What do I care?

280
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:34,226
Without you, my life is over anyway.

281
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:39,607
See, that is exactly the type of
needy, desperate, deranged behavior

282
00:11:39,613 --> 00:11:42,505
that it takes to keep
a marriage together.

283
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,658
Sorry, I flushed.

284
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:51,943
What's with the hats?

285
00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:53,375
Well, uh...

286
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,467
we just wanted to show you
that we support your cause.

287
00:11:56,473 --> 00:11:57,775
My cause?

288
00:11:58,363 --> 00:12:00,071
You guys are hilarious.

289
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,248
I told you this wasn't gonna work.

290
00:12:09,755 --> 00:12:11,479
I like mine.

291
00:12:12,604 --> 00:12:14,042
Whoa, are you cooking?

292
00:12:14,048 --> 00:12:17,114
Yeah. I just realized
that I did have a tendency

293
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,983
to let Lena do most
of the household stuff,

294
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:21,597
and now, I'm... trying to... you know...

295
00:12:21,603 --> 00:12:23,024
- Change?
- Yes.

296
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,330
Change.

297
00:12:24,336 --> 00:12:25,887
W-Why now?

298
00:12:26,115 --> 00:12:28,985
Well, for starters,
my daughter hates me.

299
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:30,985
I mean, I-I've already screwed
up my relationship with Lena.

300
00:12:30,991 --> 00:12:32,520
I don't want to lose Mae, too.

301
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,170
Martin, you're so vulnerable right now.

302
00:12:37,475 --> 00:12:40,404
It's beautiful, bro.
It's seriously beautiful.

303
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:43,601
- Can I give you a hug?
- I-I-I don't really want to do that.

304
00:12:43,607 --> 00:12:44,807
Come on.

305
00:12:44,986 --> 00:12:46,240
Let's hug.

306
00:12:48,197 --> 00:12:49,435
Okay.

307
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,360
- Mmm.
- Ahh.

308
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:57,967
It's all right.

309
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:02,101
- Oh!
- Aah!

310
00:13:02,107 --> 00:13:03,923
Stay in the hug, all
right? Don't turn around.

311
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:05,751
- Oh god, what's happening? What...
- You don't want to see.

312
00:13:05,757 --> 00:13:07,796
- I do want to see!
- Okay, you're gonna stay in the hug,

313
00:13:07,802 --> 00:13:10,423
because you're gonna need it.
Now, slowly rotate to the right.

314
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:13,381
Slowly. Great. Great!

315
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,394
She got a date, huh?

316
00:13:25,231 --> 00:13:26,431
_

317
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:28,349
I'm, uh, really glad you texted.

318
00:13:28,355 --> 00:13:30,967
- Well, I'm glad you responded.
- Of course I responded.

319
00:13:31,843 --> 00:13:34,571
Although, to be clear,
I don't do cocaine.

320
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:36,609
Okay, is that the coke emoji?

321
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:38,267
I...

322
00:13:38,273 --> 00:13:40,702
You're really cute. You know?

323
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:42,436
And pretty.

324
00:13:43,397 --> 00:13:45,309
And I would like to kiss you.

325
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:50,652
Uh, I-I-I'd like to administer a kiss.

326
00:13:50,738 --> 00:13:53,458
Well, let me prep the patient.

327
00:13:53,464 --> 00:13:54,777
Ahh.

328
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:59,727
- Soft, but not mushy. And, like, tongue,
- Oh...

329
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:01,655
but not an oppressive
amount. You know what?

330
00:14:01,661 --> 00:14:04,137
Use your best judgment on the tongue.

331
00:14:05,229 --> 00:14:07,008
I just wouldn't... I wouldn't go crazy.

332
00:14:07,204 --> 00:14:09,211
- Okay.
- You like to call the shots, huh?

333
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:11,198
Sorry. I'm sorry.

334
00:14:11,204 --> 00:14:13,704
- I just... I'm trying to work on that.
- Yeah.

335
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,706
- You know what? Don't listen to me.
- Oh, okay.

336
00:14:15,712 --> 00:14:17,811
You just kiss me however you want.

337
00:14:18,397 --> 00:14:19,597
Thank you.

338
00:14:19,787 --> 00:14:21,515
And I'm sure you're gonna crush it.

339
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:24,682
- So, good luck in there. You got it.
- Okay.

340
00:14:24,688 --> 00:14:26,201
- Can I come in now?
- Do it.

341
00:14:37,739 --> 00:14:40,655
I think, maybe, I got into
your head a little bit.

342
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:43,071
Um, why don't we take another run at it,

343
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:45,155
but this time, you know, just...

344
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:46,979
I think, it was like...

345
00:14:46,985 --> 00:14:50,272
- It was...
- Wait. Uh, rain check.

346
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:52,586
One of my patients
just landed in the ER.

347
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:55,093
- Oh, my gosh. Of course, yes. Go.
- Uh...

348
00:14:58,192 --> 00:14:59,405
Bye.

349
00:15:05,675 --> 00:15:07,521
So, you're a nightmare.

350
00:15:08,422 --> 00:15:09,793
I beg your pardon?

351
00:15:09,923 --> 00:15:11,287
Well, how can anyone succeed

352
00:15:11,293 --> 00:15:12,990
when they're being given
that much direction?

353
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,505
See, now, I would argue,
"How can one not succeed

354
00:15:15,511 --> 00:15:16,972
when given that much direction?"

355
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:18,268
So, you dictate orders,

356
00:15:18,274 --> 00:15:19,683
he says, "Yes, ma'am," and

357
00:15:19,689 --> 00:15:22,390
- next thing you know...
- Haven't had sex in two years.

358
00:15:22,768 --> 00:15:24,277
Who hasn't?

359
00:15:24,283 --> 00:15:26,072
What? I don't know. Not me.

360
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:28,221
I was just saying, like, one hasn't...

361
00:15:28,305 --> 00:15:30,214
just one that hasn't had sex
in two years. I don't know.

362
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,089
I'm just saying hypotheticals.

363
00:15:33,095 --> 00:15:36,127
Well, hypothetically...

364
00:15:37,926 --> 00:15:40,316
I think you need someone
who knows how to push back.

365
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:41,841
My ex-husband pushed back.

366
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:43,740
- Did he push back hard?
- Hard...

367
00:15:43,746 --> 00:15:45,649
yeah. We fought all the time.

368
00:15:46,247 --> 00:15:48,368
So, maybe you like it gentle.

369
00:15:49,855 --> 00:15:52,128
Okay.

370
00:15:52,304 --> 00:15:56,001
Relax. Let's just relax, okay?

371
00:15:56,132 --> 00:15:57,603
I'm someone's mother.

372
00:15:57,609 --> 00:15:59,610
I'm actually three people's mother.

373
00:15:59,616 --> 00:16:03,807
And motherhood and
sexuality can't co-exist?

374
00:16:04,177 --> 00:16:06,587
'Cause, from where I'm
sitting, they can...

375
00:16:07,693 --> 00:16:08,893
and do...

376
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:13,400
...if you could just chill out a little.

377
00:16:14,008 --> 00:16:15,752
I can chill out.

378
00:16:17,023 --> 00:16:19,201
I don't want to lie to
you... I cannot chill out.

379
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,827
Kids! Dinner!

380
00:16:22,826 --> 00:16:24,328
Okay, you guys.

381
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:26,772
So, the reason I do not cook

382
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:29,287
is not because I am a male chauvinist,

383
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,499
it's because...

384
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:34,607
...I suck.

385
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:49,630
It's delicious.

386
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,338
Stop it.

387
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,036
It is. See for yourself.

388
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:56,940
It looks like dog barf,
but it tastes great.

389
00:16:56,946 --> 00:16:58,146
Cut it out.

390
00:17:03,301 --> 00:17:04,914
It is delicious.

391
00:17:05,302 --> 00:17:07,484
Men really can do everything, huh?

392
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:14,624
- Not bad, huh?
- See, Dad?

393
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,313
If I hadn't pizza-shamed you,
you would have never discovered

394
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,517
- your inner domestic goddess.
- Mm.

395
00:17:19,523 --> 00:17:20,915
This is true.

396
00:17:20,921 --> 00:17:23,524
- Can I be excused?
- Yes, you can, little man.

397
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,257
- Uh, me, too?
- Yeah. You, too.

398
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,743
- Hey, Mae.
- Hm?

399
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:31,067
You know, just because I'm the guy

400
00:17:31,164 --> 00:17:33,471
doesn't mean that I'm the bad guy.

401
00:17:34,045 --> 00:17:35,245
I know.

402
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,636
Okay. Good.

403
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:39,358
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

404
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,836
When you were little, I really
knew how to play with you.

405
00:17:43,842 --> 00:17:46,054
I did. I would... I would
throw you up in the air,

406
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,591
and you would scream and
run around, and I mean...

407
00:17:49,772 --> 00:17:53,976
But then, you grew up,
and you got so serious.

408
00:17:54,483 --> 00:17:56,772
- I still like to play.
- You do?

409
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,613
What do you like to play?

410
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,760
Boggle.

411
00:18:03,844 --> 00:18:06,759
Well, Mae, I have some
really bad news for you.

412
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:09,371
Tomorrow night...

413
00:18:10,016 --> 00:18:11,636
I'm gonna murder you.

414
00:18:12,411 --> 00:18:14,175
At Boggle!

415
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,924
- All right.
- Okay.

416
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:25,920
You're home early.

417
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:29,232
Are you waiting up for me?

418
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:30,438
No.

419
00:18:31,308 --> 00:18:32,508
Yes.

420
00:18:34,805 --> 00:18:36,232
Hey.

421
00:18:36,712 --> 00:18:38,197
You cooked.

422
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,918
Is Mae happy?

423
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,233
Your books were very helpful.

424
00:18:42,392 --> 00:18:45,396
And so was your advice, so, thank you.

425
00:18:45,402 --> 00:18:46,602
You're welcome.

426
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:53,896
And I'm... I'm sorry if I, um, just...

427
00:18:54,122 --> 00:18:56,812
If I have a tendency to... just...

428
00:18:58,318 --> 00:19:00,425
I'm sorry that I blocked your sunshine.

429
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,606
Well, I'm sorry for whatever I said

430
00:19:04,612 --> 00:19:07,737
that made you highlight
pages 18 through 48.

431
00:19:07,743 --> 00:19:09,435
You actually read that?

432
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:12,825
- Oh, I read. I cook. I clean.
- Oh?

433
00:19:12,831 --> 00:19:14,492
I run a mile in under 6.

434
00:19:14,498 --> 00:19:16,398
Oh. Okay.

435
00:19:19,787 --> 00:19:22,592
