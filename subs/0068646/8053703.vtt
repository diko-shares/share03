1
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.600
I believe in America.

2
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.700
America has made my fortune.

3
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.900
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.800
I gave her freedom, but I taught
her never to dishonor her family.

5
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.400
She found a boyfriend,
not an Italian.

6
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.900
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

7
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.700
I didn't protest.

8
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.500
Two months ago he took her for a
drive with another boyfriend.

9
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.100
They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.600
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

11
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.800
She resisted, she
kept her honor.

12
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.200
So they beat her like an animal.

13
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

14
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.500
her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.

15
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.100
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

16
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.700
But I wept. Why did I weep?

17
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.700
She was the light of my life.

18
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.400
Beautiful girl.

19
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Now she will never
be beautiful again.

20
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.900
Sorry.

21
00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.900
I went to the police,
like a good American.

22
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.600
These two boys were
brought to trial.

23
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.500
The judge sentenced them
to three years in prison,

24
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.700
but suspended the sentence.

25
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.900
Suspended the sentence! They
went free that very day!

26
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.500
I stood in the
courtroom like a fool.

27
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.100
Those two bastards,
they smiled at me.

28
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.900
Then I said to my wife, "For justice,
we must go to Don Corleone."

29
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.700
Why did you go to the police? Why
didn't you come to me first?

30
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.900
What do you want of me? Tell me
anything, but do what I beg you to do.

31
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.700
What is that?

32
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.700
I want them dead.

33
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.100
That I cannot do.

34
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.900
I'll give you anything you ask.

35
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.800
I've known you many years, but this is
the first time you've asked for help.

36
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.100
I can't remember the last time you
invited me for a cup of coffee.

37
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.000
Even though my wife is
godmother to your only child.

38
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.100
But let's be Frank here. You
never wanted my friendship.

39
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.900
And you were afraid
to be in my debt.

40
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.400
I didn't want to
get into trouble.

41
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.200
I understand.

42
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.500
You found Paradise in America.

43
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.500
You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

44
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.300
You didn't need a
friend like me.

45
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.500
But now you come to me and say,

46
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.000
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

47
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.800
But you don't ask with respect.

48
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.600
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

49
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:33.200
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

50
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.800
I ask you for justice.

51
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.900
That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.

52
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.400
Let them suffer, then,
as she suffers.

53
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.800
How much shall I pay you?

54
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.400
Bonasera, Bonasera.

55
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.600
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

56
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.200
If you'd come in friendship,

57
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.700
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

58
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:25.000
And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

59
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.800
And then they would fear you.

60
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.400
Be my friend?

61
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.900
Godfather?

62
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.500
Good.

63
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.800
Some day, and that day may never
come, I'll ask a service of you.

64
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.300
But until that day

65
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.400
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

66
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.900
- Gràzie, Godfather.
- Prego.

67
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.600
Give this to Clemenza.

68
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.400
I want people that aren't
going to get carried away.

69
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.600
We're not murderers, in spite
of what this undertaker says.

70
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.300
- Where's Michael?
- Don't worry, he'll be here.

71
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.600
We're not taking the
picture without Michael.

72
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.400
- What's the matter?
- It's Michael.

73
00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.700
Don Barzini.

74
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.400
Hey, Paulie! Let
me have some wine.

75
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.700
Paulie! More wine.

76
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.800
- You look terrific on the floor.
- Are you a dance judge or something?

77
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.100
Take a walk and do your job.

78
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.100
Sandra, watch the kids.
Don't let them run wild.

79
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.700
You watch yourself, all right?

80
00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:10.100
20, 30 grand. In
small bills, cash.

81
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.400
In that little silk purse.

82
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.100
If this were somebody else's wedding...
Sfortunato!

83
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.400
Hey, Paulie!

84
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.300
I got two gabagool,
capocol, and a prosciut.

85
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.500
Stupid jerk!

86
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.500
What's the matter?

87
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.400
- Have to go back to work.
- Tom.

88
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.700
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

89
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:04.500
Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me.

90
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.600
Get out of here! It's a
private party. Go on!

91
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.600
What is it? It's my
sister's wedding.

92
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.900
Goddamn FBI don't
respect nothing!

93
00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.300
Come here, come here, come here!

94
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:51.100
But towards the end, he was paroled
to help with the American war effort,

95
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.300
so for six months he's
worked in my pastry shop.

96
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.100
Nazorine, what can I do for you?

97
00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.200
Now that the war is over,

98
00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:03.300
this boy, Enzo, they want to
repatriate him back to Italy.

99
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:08.200
Godfather, I have a daughter.
You see, she and Enzo...

100
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.900
You want Enzo to stay in this country,
and your daughter to be married.

101
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.400
You understand everything.

102
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.600
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.

103
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:27.700
Wait till you see the wedding
cake I made for your daughter!

104
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.500
The bride, the groom
and the angel...

105
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.300
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisan.

106
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.000
Give it to a Jew Congressman
in another district.

107
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.600
Who else is on the list?

108
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.200
Hey, Michael!

109
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.500
He's not on the list, but
Luca Brasi wants to see you.

110
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.700
Is this necessary?

111
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:30.400
He didn't expect to be invited to the
wedding, so he wanted to thank you.

112
00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:37.100
Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me

113
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.100
on the wedding day
of your daughter.

114
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.600
May their first child
be a masculine child.

115
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.200
Michael...

116
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.400
That man over there is
talking to himself.

117
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.300
See that scary guy over there?

118
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.900
- He's a very scary guy.
- What's his name?

119
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.600
His name is Luca Brasi. He
helps my father out sometimes.

120
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.300
Michael, he's coming over here!

121
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.500
You look terrific!

122
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.900
My brother Tom Hagen,
Miss Kay Adams.

123
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.900
Your father's been
asking for you.

124
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.800
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

125
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.300
Why does your brother
have a different name?

126
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.200
My brother Sonny found
Tom Hagen in the street.

127
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:35.200
He had no home, so my
father took him in.

128
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.100
He's been with us ever since.

129
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.100
He's a good lawyer.

130
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.500
Not a Sicilian. I think he's
going to be consigliere.

131
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.600
- What's that?
- That's a,

132
00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.400
like a counselor, an advisor.
Very important for the family.

133
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.600
You like your lasagna?

134
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.100
Don Corleone.

135
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.800
I'm honored and grateful

136
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.700
that you have invited me to
your daughter's wedding.

137
00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:19.000
On the day of your
daughter's wedding.

138
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:24.000
And I hope that their first child
will be a masculine child.

139
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:30.500
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

140
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:37.900
- For your daughter's bridal purse.
- Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.

141
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.100
Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you
now, because I know you're busy.

142
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.000
Thank you.

143
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.800
Signora Corleone!

144
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.900
No!

145
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.100
Senator Cauley apologized for not
coming, but said you'd understand.

146
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.400
Also some of the judges.
They've all sent gifts.

147
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.700
What is that outside?

148
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:17.300
Johnny! Johnny!

149
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.000
I love you!

150
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.700
He came all the way from California.
I told you he'd come!

151
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.300
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

152
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:42.700
Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!

153
00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.100
You never said you
knew Johnny Fontane!

154
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:05.300
- Sure. You want to meet him?
- Great! Sure.

155
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:09.200
- My father helped him with his career.
- He did?

156
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.400
How?

157
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.700
- Let's listen to this song.
- Michael...

158
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.200
Please, Michael. Tell me.

159
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:59.800
When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract

160
00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.700
with a big bandleader.

161
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:07.100
And as his career got better and
better, he wanted to get out of it.

162
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.800
Johnny is my father's godson.

163
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.200
My father went to see
this bandleader.

164
00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:18.200
He offered him $ 10,000
to let Johnny go,

165
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.000
but the bandleader said no.

166
00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:26.500
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

167
00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.500
Within an hour,

168
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:36.100
he signed a release for a
certified check of $ 1,000.

169
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:42.100
- How did he do that?
- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

170
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:48.600
- What was that?
- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

171
00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:54.000
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

172
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.600
That's a true story.

173
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.700
That's my family, Kay.
It's not me.

174
00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.900
Beautiful!

175
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.300
I'll take care of it.

176
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.300
Tom...

177
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:09.100
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

178
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.300
How are you, Fredo?

179
00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.000
My brother Fredo,
this is Kay Adams.

180
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.300
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

181
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:31.800
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

182
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.500
Yeah. This is your friend?

183
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:39.200
I don't know what to do. My
voice is weak. It's weak.

184
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:47.400
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,
it puts me right back on top again.

185
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:52.800
But this... man won't give it
to me, the head of the studio.

186
00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.200
- What's his name?
- Woltz.

187
00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.400
He won't give it to me, and
he says there's no chance.

188
00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.000
Sonny?

189
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.800
Sonny?

190
00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.400
Sonny?

191
00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.000
- Sonny, are you in there?
- What?

192
00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.000
The old man wants you.

193
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.900
One minute.

194
00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:44.400
A month ago he bought the movie
rights to this book, a best-seller.

195
00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.100
The main character is
a guy just like me.

196
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.800
I wouldn't even have to act.

197
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.600
Godfather, I don't
know what to do.

198
00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:00.200
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

199
00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:06.000
Is this how you turned out? A Hollywood
finocchio that cries like a woman?

200
00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:10.200
"What can I do? What can I
do?" What is that nonsense?

201
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.900
Ridiculous.

202
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.800
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

203
00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.500
Good.

204
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:26.300
Because a man who doesn't spend time
with his family can never be a real man.

205
00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:35.300
You look terrible.
I want you to eat.

206
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:40.700
Rest, and in a month this Hollywood
big shot will give you what you want.

207
00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.900
It's too late, they start
shooting in a week.

208
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.200
I'm going to make him an
offer he can't refuse.

209
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Just go outside and enjoy yourself,
and forget about all this nonsense.

210
00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.200
- I want you to leave it all to me.
- All right.

211
00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:30.600
- What time does my daughter leave?
- Soon, after they cut the cake.

212
00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:34.300
Do we give your son-in-law
something important?

213
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:39.700
Never. Give him a living, but never
discuss the family business with him.

214
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.600
- What else?
- Virgil Sollozzo called.

215
00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:47.200
- We'll have to see him next week.
- When you come back from California.

216
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.700
- When am I going to California?
- Tonight.

217
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:57.100
I want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for Johnny.

218
00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.600
If there's nothing else, I'd like
to go to my daughter's wedding.

219
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.700
Carlo, we're going
to take the picture.

220
00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.500
Wait a minute.

221
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.900
No, Michael. Not me.

222
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.300
Okay, that's it. Just like that.
Hold it!

223
00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.600
- You need a little more heat on that arc.
- Start talking.

224
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:17.100
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

225
00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.900
This friend would give his
friendship to Mr. Woltz,

226
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.900
if Mr. Woltz would
grant us a favor.

227
00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:26.300
Woltz is listening.

228
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.500
Give Johnny the part in that war
film you're starting next week.

229
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:41.200
And what favor would your
friend grant Mr. Woltz?

230
00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.800
He could make your future
union problems disappear.

231
00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:49.000
And one of your stars has just
moved from marijuana to heroin.

232
00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:53.400
Are you trying to muscle me?
Listen, you son-of-a-bitch!

233
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.000
Let me lay it on the line.

234
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.100
Johnny Fontane will
never get that movie!

235
00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:02.700
No matter how many Dago Guinea
greaseballs come out of the woodwork!

236
00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.700
- I'm German-Irish.
- Listen here, my Kraut-Mick friend.

237
00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:11.100
- I'm going to make trouble for you!
- I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened...

238
00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.600
I know New York's big lawyers.
Who are you?

239
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:18.200
I have a special practice.
I handle one client.

240
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.300
I'll wait for your call.

241
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
By the way, I admire
your pictures very much.

242
00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.300
Check him out.

243
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.400
- It's really beautiful.
- Look at this.

244
00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:01.000
- It used to decorate a King's palace.
- Very nice.

245
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.400
Why didn't you say you
work for Corleone?

246
00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:07.800
I thought you were some cheap
hustler Johnny was running in.

247
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.200
- I only use his name when necessary.
- How's your drink?

248
00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.800
- Fine.
- Now I'll show you something beautiful.

249
00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.400
You do appreciate
beauty, don't you?

250
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.400
There you are. $600,000
on four hoofs.

251
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:27.500
I bet Russian czars never
paid that for a single horse.

252
00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.100
Khartoum.

253
00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.000
Khartoum.

254
00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:37.000
I'm not going to race him, though.
I'm going to put him out to stud.

255
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.100
Thanks, Tony.

256
00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.800
Let's get something to eat.

257
00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:47.300
Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

258
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.800
To the Italian people that's a
very sacred, close relationship.

259
00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.800
I respect it. Tell him
to ask me anything else.

260
00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.200
This favor I can't give him.

261
00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.600
He never asks a second favor when
he's been refused the first.

262
00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:07.900
You don't understand. Johnny
Fontane never gets that movie.

263
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.600
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

264
00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:15.800
I'm going to run him out of the
business, and let me tell you why.

265
00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:22.500
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable protégés.

266
00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:28.000
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

267
00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:32.700
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her, to make her a big star.

268
00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.600
Let me be even more Frank.

269
00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.100
To show you that I'm not
a hard-hearted man.

270
00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.600
That it's not all
dollars and cents.

271
00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:44.400
She was beautiful. She
was young and innocent!

272
00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:49.900
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.

273
00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:56.100
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

274
00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.900
And she runs off.

275
00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:03.300
She threw it all away just
to make me look ridiculous!

276
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:08.500
And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!

277
00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.000
You get the hell out of here!

278
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.400
If that goombah tries any rough
stuff, tell him I'm no bandleader.

279
00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.700
Yeah, I heard that story.

280
00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:24.600
Thank you for dinner and
a very pleasant evening.

281
00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.500
Maybe your car can take
me to the airport.

282
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.200
Mr. Corleone insists on
hearing bad news immediately.

283
00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:27.800
- You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

284
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:31.000
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

285
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.300
Now...

286
00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.900
Sollozzo is known as The Turk.

287
00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:39.900
He's supposed to be
very good with a knife,

288
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.400
but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint.

289
00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.700
His business is narcotics.

290
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.200
He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.

291
00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:55.100
In Sicily he has plants to
process them into heroin.

292
00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.700
He needs cash, he needs
protection from the police.

293
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.700
He'll give a piece of the action.
I don't know how much.

294
00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:08.100
The Tattaglia family is behind him here.
They have to be in it for something.

295
00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:13.900
- What about his prison record?
- One term in Italy, one here.

296
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.800
He's known as a top
narcotics man.

297
00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:21.500
- Santino, what do you think?
- A lot of money in that white powder.

298
00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:25.200
Tom?

299
00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:29.500
Yes. There's more money in
narcotics than anything else.

300
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:34.300
If we don't get into it, somebody
else will, maybe the five families.

301
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:38.900
With that money they can buy
more police and political power.

302
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.100
Then they come after us.

303
00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:47.700
Now we have unions and gambling, and
that's great, but narcotics is the future.

304
00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:52.900
If we don't get a piece of that action,
we risk everything in 10 years' time.

305
00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:00.500
So? What's your answer
going to be, Pop?

306
00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.000
Don Corleone.

307
00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:12.400
I need a man who has
powerful friends.

308
00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:15.300
I need a million
dollars in cash.

309
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:21.200
I need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.

310
00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:26.600
- What is the interest for my family?
- 30%.

311
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:30.700
In the first year your end should
be three, four million dollars.

312
00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.800
And then it would go up.

313
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.400
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

314
00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.200
My compliments.

315
00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:48.300
I'll take care of them,
out of my share.

316
00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:52.700
So I receive 30% for finance,

317
00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.100
political influence
and legal protection?

318
00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.900
That's right.

319
00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:03.100
Why do you come to me? Why do
I deserve this generosity?

320
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:08.500
If you consider a million
dollars in cash just finance,

321
00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.800
te salud Don Corleone.

322
00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:26.500
I said that I would see you, because
I heard you were a serious man,

323
00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.900
to be treated with respect.

324
00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.800
But, I must say no to you.

325
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.800
And I'll give you my reason.

326
00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:43.800
It's true, I have a lot
of friends in politics.

327
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.400
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

328
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:55.100
which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

329
00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:00.200
It doesn't make any difference to
me what a man does for a living.

330
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:05.600
But your business is...
a little dangerous.

331
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:10.100
If you're worried about security,
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

332
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:13.700
- The Tattaglias would guarantee our...
- Wait a minute.

333
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.800
I have a sentimental weakness for
my children, and I spoil them.

334
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:29.100
They talk when they should listen.
But anyway...

335
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:34.600
Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish
to congratulate you on your new business.

336
00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:38.100
I know you'll do
well, and good luck.

337
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:43.100
Especially since your interests don't
conflict with mine. Thank you.

338
00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:05.600
Santino.

339
00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.500
Come here.

340
00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.800
What's the matter with you?

341
00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:16.500
Your brain is going soft
from playing with that girl.

342
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.700
Never tell anybody outside the
family what you're thinking again.

343
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.300
Go on.

344
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.100
Tom, what's this nonsense?

345
00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:33.600
It's from Johnny. He's
starring in that new film.

346
00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:38.500
- Take it away.
- Take it over there.

347
00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.300
And

348
00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.500
tell Luca Brasi to come in.

349
00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:54.100
I'm a little worried about
this Sollozzo fellow.

350
00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:57.100
Find out what he's got
under his fingernails.

351
00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:01.800
Go to the Tattaglias.

352
00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:06.100
Make them think that you're
not too happy with our family

353
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.900
and find out what you can.

354
00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.700
I got something for your
mother and for Sonny

355
00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:35.400
and a tie for Freddy, and Tom
Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

356
00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.800
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Just you.

357
00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:12.600
Andiamo, Fredo.

358
00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:16.100
- Tell Paulie to get the car.
- Okay, Pop.

359
00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:20.200
I'll have to get it myself. Paulie
called in sick this morning.

360
00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:25.200
Paulie's a good kid. I don't
mind getting the car.

361
00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.800
Buon natale, Caro. Gràzie.

362
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.700
- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
- I know.

363
00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.600
You know who I am?

364
00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.000
I know you.

365
00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.900
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family... right?

366
00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:39.900
I think you and I
can do business.

367
00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.400
I need someone strong like you.

368
00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.900
I heard you are not happy...

369
00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.600
with the Corleone family.

370
00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.100
Want to join me?

371
00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:56.200
What's in it for me?

372
00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:01.800
$50,000 to start with.

373
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.000
Not bad!

374
00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:08.300
Agreed?

375
00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.500
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.

376
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:16.500
- Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.
- I haven't got time.

377
00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.700
Make time, Consigliere.
Get in the car.

378
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:26.000
What are you worried about? If I wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead already.

379
00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:27.500
Get in.

380
00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:42.300
- Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pop.

381
00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:51.900
Merry Christmas. I
want some fruit.

382
00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:23.500
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
Like in the story.

383
00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:27.600
No.

384
00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:32.100
- What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
- Now, that's a thought.

385
00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:36.600
Michael.

386
00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:39.100
No, I wouldn't like you better
if you were Ingrid Bergman.

387
00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:41.000
What's the matter?

388
00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:00.600
They don't say if
he's dead or alive.

389
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:26.100
- Sonny, it's Michael.
- Where have you been?

390
00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.000
- Is he all right?
- We don't know yet.

391
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.100
There are all kinds of stories.
He was hit bad, Mikey.

392
00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:38.300
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

393
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:43.300
- Where have you been? I was worried.
- Didn't Tom tell you I called?

394
00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:47.400
No. Look, come home, kid. You
should be with Mama, you hear?

395
00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:56.500
Oh, my God.

396
00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:01.900
Sonny!

397
00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:13.100
Stay back there.

398
00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.800
- Who is it?
- Open up, it's Clemenza.

399
00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:21.500
There's more news
about your old man.

400
00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.800
Word is out that
he's already dead.

401
00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:28.100
- What's the matter with you?
- Take it easy!

402
00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:31.500
- Where was Paulie?
- Sick. He's been sick all winter.

403
00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:34.000
- How often?
- Only three, four times.

404
00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:37.900
- Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
- Pick him up now.

405
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.800
I don't care how sick he is. Bring
him to my father's house right now.

406
00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:46.000
- You want anyone sent over here?
- No. Go ahead.

407
00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:59.200
I'm going to have a couple of our
people come over to the house.

408
00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:04.300
- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?

409
00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:07.200
- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.

410
00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:11.000
In three hours he'll be
released with our proposition.

411
00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:14.400
Listen to what he has to say
before you do anything.

412
00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:19.100
What's done is done. Don't lose
that famous temper of yours, Sonny.

413
00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.900
I'll wait.

414
00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.300
Your boss is dead.

415
00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:44.500
I know you're not in the muscle end
of the family, so don't be scared.

416
00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:49.500
I want you to help the
Corleones and me.

417
00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:57.900
We got him outside his office about
an hour after we picked you up.

418
00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.700
Drink it.

419
00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:08.900
It's up to you to make peace
between me and Sonny.

420
00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:15.900
Sonny was hot for
my deal, wasn't he?

421
00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:20.100
And you knew it was the
right thing to do.

422
00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:26.400
- Sonny will come after you.
- That will be his first reaction, sure.

423
00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:34.300
So you have to talk sense into him.
The Tattaglia family is behind me.

424
00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:39.500
The other New York families will go
along with anything to prevent war.

425
00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:44.800
Let's face it, with all due respect,
the Don rest in peace was slipping.

426
00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:50.800
Ten years ago, could I
have gotten to him?

427
00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:58.600
Well, now he's dead, Tom, and
nothing can bring him back.

428
00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:06.300
You've got to talk to Sonny, to the
Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.

429
00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:13.400
It's good business, Tom.

430
00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:19.600
I'll try. But even Sonny won't
be able to call off Luca Brasi.

431
00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:24.400
Yeah, well...

432
00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:28.600
Let me worry about Luca.

433
00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.200
You just talk to Sonny.

434
00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:38.500
And the other two kids.

435
00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:44.000
- I'll do my best.
- Good.

436
00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.800
Now you can go.

437
00:51:55.600 --> 00:52:00.300
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

438
00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:02.900
Blood is a big expense.

439
00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:26.000
He's still alive.

440
00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:30.000
They hit him with five
shots, and he's still alive!

441
00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:34.900
That's bad luck for me, and bad luck
for you if you don't make that deal.

442
00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:22.000
Your mother is at the
hospital with your father.

443
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.400
Looks like he'll pull through.

444
00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:32.900
It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip
Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...

445
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.400
- You gonna kill all those guys?
- Stay out of it.

446
00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:38.900
If you get rid of Sollozzo,
everything falls into line.

447
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:43.300
What about Luca? Sollozzo
thinks he can control him.

448
00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:47.200
If Luca sold out, we're
in a lot of trouble.

449
00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:50.800
- Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
- We've been trying all night.

450
00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:55.000
- Hey, do me a favor...
- Luca never sleeps over with a broad.

451
00:53:57.100 --> 00:54:02.300
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.
What do we do if the old man dies?

452
00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:09.600
If we lose the old man, we lose the
political contacts and half our strength.

453
00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:15.400
The other New York families might
support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.

454
00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:20.000
This is almost 1946. Nobody
wants bloodshed anymore.

455
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:21.800
If your father dies

456
00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:25.900
you make the deal.

457
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.900
- Easy to say. He's not your father.
- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.

458
00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:37.000
What is it?

459
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:43.800
- Paulie, I told you to stay put.
- The guy at the gates has a package.

460
00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:46.000
Tessio, go see what it is.

461
00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:51.600
- Shall I stay?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

462
00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:55.400
- I'm fine.
- There's food. Are you hungry?

463
00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:59.100
- No.
- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.

464
00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:01.800
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

465
00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:09.600
Take care of that son-of-a-bitch.
Paulie sold out the old man.

466
00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:13.300
- Make that the first thing on your list.
- Understood.

467
00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:17.600
Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys
and go to Luca's apartment.

468
00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:21.400
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

469
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.700
Hanging around the house on the
phone would be a big help.

470
00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.500
Try Luca again.

471
00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:42.200
- What's this?
- A Sicilian message.

472
00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:45.100
It means Luca Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.

473
00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:00.900
- I'm going.
- When will you be home?

474
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.700
Probably late.

475
00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:08.900
- Don't forget the cannoli!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

476
00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:15.700
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rear-view mirror.

477
00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:20.600
Sonny's running wild. He wants
to go to mattresses already.

478
00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:26.600
We have to find a spot on the West Side.
Try 309 West 43rd Street.

479
00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:30.200
- Know a good spot on the West Side?
- I'll think about it.

480
00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:34.000
Think while you're driving. I
want to hit New York this month.

481
00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:35.800
Watch the kids.

482
00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:52.500
Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up
18 mattresses and bring me the bill.

483
00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:54.000
Yeah, all right.

484
00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:58.500
Make sure they're clean, because the
guys will be there a long time.

485
00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:02.900
- They're clean and exterminated.
- That's a bad word to use.

486
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.900
Exterminate! Watch out, so
we don't exterminate you!

487
00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:16.100
Pull over. I've got
to take a leak.

488
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.200
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.

489
00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:22.300
Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!

490
00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:26.300
- Yeah.
- Phone call!

491
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:34.600
- Who is it?
- Some girl.

492
00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:41.300
- Hello. Kay?
- How's your father?

493
00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:43.400
He's going to make it.

494
00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:45.700
I love you.

495
00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:48.700
I love you!

496
00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:52.200
- Michael?
- Yeah, I know.

497
00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:55.200
- Tell me you love me.
- I can't talk.

498
00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:57.200
Can't you say it?

499
00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.200
I'll see you tonight.

500
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.200
Why don't you tell that
nice girl you love her?

501
00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:09.000
I love you with all my heart. If I don't
see you again soon, I'm going to die!

502
00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:15.000
Come and learn something. You might
have to cook for 20 guys some day.

503
00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:18.700
You start with a little
oil, then fry some garlic.

504
00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:24.500
Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.

505
00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:28.600
You get it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.

506
00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.600
Add a little bit of wine.

507
00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:40.300
And a little bit of sugar.
That's my trick.

508
00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:44.700
Cut the crap. I have more important
things for you. How's Paulie?

509
00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:47.000
You won't see him no more.

510
00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:50.900
- Where are you going?
- To the city.

511
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.500
- Send bodyguards with him.
- I'm going to the hospital...

512
00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:57.900
He'll be all right. Sollozzo
knows he's a civilian.

513
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

514
01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.400
Send somebody with him anyway.

515
01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:36.500
- I have to go.
- Can I go with you?

516
01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:42.700
No, Kay. There will be detectives
there, people from the press.

517
01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:44.900
I'll wait in the cab.

518
01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:50.100
I don't want you
to get involved.

519
01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:55.100
When will I see you again?

520
01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:05.600
Go back to New Hampshire, and I'll
call you at your parents' house.

521
01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:12.000
- When will I see you again, Michael?
- I don't know.

522
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:28.100
What are you doing here? You're
not supposed to be here.

523
01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:31.700
I'm Michael Corleone.
This is my father.

524
01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.100
What happened to the guards?

525
01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:39.600
Your father had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospital service.

526
01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:43.000
The police made them leave
about 10 minutes ago.

527
01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:51.500
Get me Long Beach 45620, please.

528
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.400
Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.

529
01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:05.300
Sonny, I'm at the hospital. I got
here late, there's nobody here.

530
01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:09.600
No Tessio's men, no detectives, nobody.
Papa's all alone.

531
01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.200
- Don't panic.
- I won't panic.

532
01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:16.600
I'm sorry, but you
will have to leave.

533
01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:22.100
We're going to move
him to another room.

534
01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:25.200
Can you disconnect the tubes?

535
01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:28.800
- That's out of the question!
- Do you know my father?

536
01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:33.200
Men are coming here to kill him.
Do you understand?

537
01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:35.100
Help me, please.

538
01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:55.900
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo, the Baker.

539
01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
- Remember me?
- Enzo.

540
01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:02.200
You'd better go, there's
going to be trouble.

541
01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:07.000
If there is trouble, I'll stay
here to help you. For your father.

542
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.100
Listen. Wait for me outside, in
front of the hospital, all right?

543
01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:15.300
I'll be out in a minute.

544
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.800
Just lie here, Pop. I'll
take care of you now.

545
01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:36.800
I'm with you now.

546
01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.900
I'm with you.

547
01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:17.600
Get rid of these. Come here.

548
01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:20.700
Put your hand in your pocket,
like you have a gun.

549
01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:23.000
You'll be all right.

550
01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:16.000
You did good.

551
01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:07.700
I thought all you Guinea
hoods were locked up!

552
01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:12.400
- Why isn't anyone guarding my father?
- You little punk!

553
01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:16.400
Don't you tell me my business!
I pulled them off.

554
01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:22.500
- Stay away from this hospital!
- Not until my father's room is guarded.

555
01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:26.600
- Phil, take him in!
- The kid's clean, Captain.

556
01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:30.500
- He's a war hero. He's never been...
- I said take him in!

557
01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:39.000
- What's The Turk paying you?
- Take a hold of him. Stand him up.

558
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.900
Stand him up straight.

559
01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:08.700
I'm the Corleones' attorney. These men
are hired to protect Vito Corleone.

560
01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:11.200
They're licensed
to carry firearms.

561
01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:15.700
If you interfere, you'll have to appear
before the judge and show 'cause.

562
01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.800
Let him go.

563
01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:54.100
- What's with all the new faces?
- We'll need them now.

564
01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:57.100
After the hospital
thing, Sonny got mad.

565
01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.300
We hit Bruno Tattaglia
this morning.

566
01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.500
Jesus Christ.

567
01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:12.600
Looks like a fortress
around here.

568
01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:20.100
Tamaduch! Hey... 100 buttonmen
on the street 24 hours a day.

569
01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:23.800
That Turk shows one hair
on his ass, he's dead.

570
01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:27.900
Mike, let me look at you.

571
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000
You're beautiful, beautiful.
You're gorgeous.

572
01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:40.700
The Turk wants to talk! Imagine
the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.

573
01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:43.600
- He wants a meeting today.
- What did he say?

574
01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:48.500
What did he say... He wants us to
send Michael to hear the proposition.

575
01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:52.100
He promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.

576
01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:55.200
- And Bruno Tattaglia?
- That's part of the deal.

577
01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:59.600
- He cancels out what they did to Father.
- We should listen to them.

578
01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:02.800
No more! Not this
time, Consigliere.

579
01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:06.400
No more meetings, discussions,
or Sollozzo tricks.

580
01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:09.600
I want Sollozzo,
or we go to war...

581
01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:12.600
- The other families...
- They hand me Sollozzo!

582
01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:15.000
This is business, not personal!

583
01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:19.500
- They shot my father...
- Even that was business, not personal.

584
01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:24.200
Then business will have to suffer.
Do me a favor.

585
01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:28.300
No more advice on how to patch things up.
Just help me win.

586
01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:38.500
I found out about Captain
McCluskey, who broke Mike's jaw.

587
01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:42.900
He's definitely on Sollozzo's
payroll, and for big money.

588
01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:47.000
McCluskey has agreed to
be The Turk's bodyguard.

589
01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:50.800
So when Sollozzo is being
guarded, he's invulnerable.

590
01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:54.500
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain.

591
01:12:54.600 --> 01:13:00.500
All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!

592
01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:04.500
Even the old man's political
protection would run for cover.

593
01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:09.600
Do me a favor. Take this
into consideration.

594
01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.400
All right, we'll wait.

595
01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:23.700
We can't wait. We can't wait.

596
01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:29.100
No matter what Sollozzo says,
he's going to kill Pop.

597
01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:32.900
That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.

598
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.300
- Mike is right.
- Let me ask you something.

599
01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:42.000
What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?

600
01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:50.000
They want to have a
meeting with me, right?

601
01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:55.300
It will be me, McCluskey
and Sollozzo.

602
01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:59.300
Let's set the meeting.

603
01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:05.200
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

604
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.800
We insist it's a public place.
A bar, a restaurant.

605
01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:14.700
Some place where there are
people, so I feel safe.

606
01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:20.400
They'll search me when
I meet them, right?

607
01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:22.800
So I can't have a weapon on me.

608
01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:31.200
But if Clemenza can figure out a way
to have a weapon planted there for me

609
01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:38.300
then I'll kill them both.

610
01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:55.200
Nice college boy. Didn't want to get
mixed up in the family business.

611
01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:58.900
Now you want to shoot a police
captain because he slapped you?

612
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:05.500
This isn't like the army! You have to get
close and get their brains on your suit.

613
01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:08.700
You're taking this
very personal.

614
01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:12.200
Tom, this is business and
he's taking it personal.

615
01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:15.800
- Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
- Mikey...

616
01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:22.000
I'm talking about a cop who's mixed
up in drugs, a dishonest cop.

617
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.300
A cop who got mixed up in the
rackets and got what was coming.

618
01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:32.000
That's a terrific story. We have
newspaper people on the payroll, right?

619
01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:37.300
- They might like a story like that.
- They might.

620
01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:44.500
It's not personal, Sonny.
It's strictly business.

621
01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:49.300
It's as cold as they come.

622
01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:52.600
Impossible to trace, so you
don't worry about prints.

623
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.100
I put a special tape on the
trigger and the butt. Try it.

624
01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:11.400
Is the trigger too tight?

625
01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:15.900
My ears!

626
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.600
I left it noisy, so it scares away any
pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.

627
01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:24.700
You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?

628
01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:30.700
- Sit down, finish my dinner.
- Don't fool around.

629
01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:34.400
Let your hand drop to your
side and let the gun slip out.

630
01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:38.900
Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face,

631
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.800
so walk out fast, but don't run.

632
01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:45.300
Don't look anybody in the eye,
but don't look away either.

633
01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:48.900
They'll be scared stiff, so
don't worry about nothing.

634
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.200
You'll be all right. You'll take
a vacation, nobody knows where,

635
01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:57.400
and we'll catch the hell.

636
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.900
- How bad do you think it will be?
- Pretty goddamn bad.

637
01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:05.000
All the other families will
probably line up against us.

638
01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:07.900
These things have to happen
every five, 10 years.

639
01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:10.700
Gets rid of the bad blood.

640
01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:15.200
Been 10 years since the last one. You
have to stop them at the beginning.

641
01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:21.000
Like they should have stopped Hitler in
Munich, not letting him get away with it.

642
01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:27.000
You know, Mike, we were all proud of you.
Being a hero and all.

643
01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:28.800
Your father too.

644
01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:10.300
Nothing. Not a hint.
Absolutely nothing.

645
01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:15.500
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

646
01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.900
How much time do we have?

647
01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:23.600
They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.

648
01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:29.400
- We could put a tail on them.
- Sollozzo would lose our ass.

649
01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:35.400
- What about the negotiator?
- He's playing pinochle with my men.

650
01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:40.600
- He's happy. They're letting him win.
- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.

651
01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:44.000
The negotiator plays cards
until Mike is back safe.

652
01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:48.200
- He could blast whoever is in the car.
- They'll expect that.

653
01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:51.600
Sollozzo might not even
be in the car, Sonny!

654
01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:53.200
I'll get it.

655
01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.600
Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.

656
01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:24.000
- Is it reliable?
- My man in McCluskey's precinct.

657
01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:29.900
A police captain is on call 24 hours a day.
He'll be there between 8 and 10.

658
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.800
- Anybody know this joint?
- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.

659
01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:39.900
A small family place, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.

660
01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:45.800
They've got an old-fashioned toilet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.

661
01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:50.900
We might be able to
tape the gun behind it.

662
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.100
All right. Mike, you
go to the restaurant,

663
01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:59.100
you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
Make them relax.

664
01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:04.500
Then you go to take a leak. No, better
still, you ask permission to go.

665
01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:09.000
Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.

666
01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.300
I want somebody very
good to plant that gun.

667
01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:16.900
I don't want him coming
out with just his dick.

668
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.500
- The gun will be there.
- You drive him and pick him up.

669
01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:24.300
Let's move.

670
01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:32.900
Did he tell you to drop
the gun right away?

671
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.900
Yeah, a million times.

672
01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:43.900
Don't forget. Two shots apiece in
the head as soon as you come out.

673
01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:54.100
How long do you think it will
be before I can come back?

674
01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:57.000
At least a year.

675
01:20:57.100 --> 01:21:01.900
I'll square it with Mom, that you're
not seeing her before you leave and...

676
01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:07.300
I'll get a message to that
girlfriend when the time is right.

677
01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:14.600
Take care.

678
01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:19.200
Take care, Mike.

679
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.800
I'm glad you came. I hope we
can straighten everything out.

680
01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.100
It's not the way I wanted things to go.
It should never have happened.

681
01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:06.500
I want to straighten everything out. I
don't want my father bothered again.

682
01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:09.800
I swear on my children
that he won't be, Mike.

683
01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:14.100
But you have to keep an
open mind when we talk.

684
01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:18.600
I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.
You can't talk business with him.

685
01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:22.200
He's a good kid.

686
01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:29.600
I'm sorry about the
other night, Mike.

687
01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:33.800
I've got to frisk you, so turn around.
On your knees, facing me.

688
01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:43.600
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.
Too grouchy.

689
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.900
Can't stand the aggravation.
You know how it is.

690
01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.600
He's clean.

691
01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.500
Going to Jersey?

692
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.500
Maybe.

693
01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:52.600
Nice work, Lou.

694
01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:35.300
- How's the food in this restaurant?
- Try the veal. It's the best in the city.

695
01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:37.100
I'll have it.

696
01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:15.800
- I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey.
- Go ahead.

697
01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:37.100
What I want...

698
01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:40.200
What's most important to me

699
01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:47.200
is that I have a guarantee. No
more attempts on my father's life.

700
01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:52.000
What guarantees can I give you?
I'm the hunted one!

701
01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:55.700
I missed my chance. You
think too much of me, kid.

702
01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:57.600
I'm not that clever.

703
01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:01.300
All I want is a truce.

704
01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:11.700
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is it all right?

705
01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:15.600
When you got to go,
you got to go.

706
01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:23.000
He's clean.

707
01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:25.200
Don't take too long.

708
01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:30.100
I've frisked a thousand punks.

709
01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:22.700
Okay, you take over.

710
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.800
I love you, Grandpa.

711
01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:47.500
I'm sorry, Pa. He
doesn't know you yet.

712
01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:51.900
- Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

713
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:58.300
" I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish
I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."

714
01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:03.600
Go with your mother.

715
01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:05.800
Take them downstairs.

716
01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:14.000
Go on, Carlo, you too.

717
01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:17.400
Go on.

718
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.000
- What's the matter with you, Carlo?
- Shut up and set the table.

719
01:33:57.500 --> 01:34:03.600
Since McCluskey's killing, the police
have cracked down on our operations.

720
01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:10.200
And also the other families.
There's been a lot of bad blood.

721
01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:13.800
They hit us, so
we hit them back.

722
01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:19.200
Through our newspaper contacts we've
been able to put out material

723
01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:23.600
about McCluskey's link with
Sollozzo in the drug rackets.

724
01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:25.800
So things are loosening up.

725
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.800
And I'm sending
Fredo to Las Vegas,

726
01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:34.400
under the protection of
Don Francesco of L.A.

727
01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:39.000
- I want him to rest.
- I'm going to learn the casino business.

728
01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:49.200
Where's Michael?

729
01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:04.600
It was Michael who
killed Sollozzo.

730
01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:10.200
But he's safe. We're starting
to work to bring him back.

731
01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:34.000
I want you to find out where that
old pimp Tattaglia is hiding.

732
01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:36.100
I want him now.

733
01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:39.700
Sonny, things are
starting to loosen up.

734
01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:44.500
If you go after Tattaglia, all hell
will break loose. Pop can negotiate.

735
01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:50.600
- He must get better first. I'll decide...
- War is costly. We can't do business.

736
01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:54.500
- Neither can they. Don't worry about it!
- We can't afford a stalemate.

737
01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:59.500
- No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!
- You're getting a great reputation!

738
01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:05.700
Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime
consigliere, I wouldn't be in this shape!

739
01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:08.100
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

740
01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:14.000
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

741
01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:18.100
Ma made a little dinner.
It's Sunday.

742
01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:23.400
Niggers are having a good time
with our policy banks in Harlem.

743
01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:27.700
Driving new Cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.

744
01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:31.100
That's because they've
started making big money.

745
01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:34.500
Papa never talked
business at the table.

746
01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:38.400
- Shut up, Connie...
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

747
01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:40.200
Don't interfere.

748
01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:46.500
I'd like to talk to you after dinner.
I could do more for the family...

749
01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:49.300
We don't discuss
business at the table.

750
01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:39.200
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

751
01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:46.700
Why are you so far
from the house?

752
01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:50.100
You know I'm responsible to
your father for your life.

753
01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:51.400
The bodyguards are here.

754
01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:53.700
It's still dangerous...

755
01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:56.600
We've heard from
Santino in New York...

756
01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.200
Your enemies know you're here.

757
01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:04.000
Did Santino say
when I can go back?

758
01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:06.000
Not yet.

759
01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:08.500
It's out of the question.

760
01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:13.300
Where are you going now?

761
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.100
To Corleone.

762
01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:17.900
Take my car.

763
01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:22.300
I want to walk.

764
01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:26.100
Be careful.

765
01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:02.000
Where have all the men gone?

766
01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:05.300
They're all dead from vendettas.

767
01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:09.300
There are the names of the dead.

768
01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:29.800
Hey, hey, take me to
the America, G.I.!

769
01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:34.200
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.
I.! Clark Gable!

770
01:39:34.300 --> 01:39:39.600
America! Take me to the America, G.
I.! Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!

771
01:39:57.500 --> 01:39:59.600
Mamma Mia what a beauty.

772
01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:10.800
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

773
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.100
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

774
01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:45.900
Did you have a good hunt?

775
01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:49.200
You know all the
girls around here?

776
01:40:49.700 --> 01:40:51.200
We saw some real beauties.

777
01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:55.600
One of them struck our
friend like a thunderbolt.

778
01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:01.600
She would tempt the
devil himself.

779
01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:11.400
Really put together.

780
01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:12.500
Right, Calo?

781
01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:18.200
Such hair, such mouth!

782
01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:23.800
The girls around here are beautiful...
but virtuous.

783
01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:26.700
This one had a purple dress...

784
01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:29.200
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

785
01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:33.200
A type more Greek than Italian.

786
01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:37.500
Do you know her?

787
01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:44.700
There's no girl like
that in this town.

788
01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:48.600
My God, I understand!

789
01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:53.800
What's wrong?

790
01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.400
Let's go.

791
01:41:59.300 --> 01:42:00.600
It's his daughter.

792
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.500
Tell him to come here.

793
01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:07.300
Call him.

794
01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:29.700
Fabrizio, you translate.

795
01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:35.700
I apologize if I offended you.

796
01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:40.100
I'm a stranger in this country.

797
01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:43.300
I meant no disrespect to
you or your daughter.

798
01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:51.600
I'm an American,
hiding in Sicily.

799
01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.400
My name is Michael Corleone.

800
01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:01.500
There are people who'd pay a lot
of money for that information.

801
01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:06.800
But then your daughter
would lose a father

802
01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:10.700
instead of gaining a husband.

803
01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:21.100
I want to meet your daughter.

804
01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:26.400
With your permission, and under
the supervision of your family.

805
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.700
With all respect.

806
01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:38.700
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

807
01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:45.800
What's her name?

808
01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:43.300
I'll knock you dizzy.

809
01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.100
Save it for the library.

810
01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:57.400
We've got to pick up my sister.

811
01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:17.200
What's the matter?

812
01:47:19.700 --> 01:47:21.500
What's the matter?

813
01:47:23.300 --> 01:47:25.200
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

814
01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:28.400
It was my fault. I hit him.

815
01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:32.300
I started a fight with him.
I hit him, so he hit me...

816
01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:40.800
I'm just going to get a
doctor to take a look at you.

817
01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:43.400
Sonny, please don't do anything.

818
01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:47.500
What's the matter with you?
What am I going to do?

819
01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:50.400
Make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

820
01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:58.200
You spic slobs still
betting Yankees?

821
01:47:58.300 --> 01:48:00.900
Tell them to stop
taking in action.

822
01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:03.500
We lost enough money last week.

823
01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:12.600
Come here, come here!

824
01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:12.900
If you touch my sister
again, I'll kill you.

825
01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:10.400
Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

826
01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:14.800
Yes, I have. I've tried
writing and calling.

827
01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:18.700
- I want to reach Michael.
- Nobody knows where he is.

828
01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:21.400
All we know is that
he's all right.

829
01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:27.500
- What was that?
- An accident, but nobody was hurt.

830
01:53:28.700 --> 01:53:32.800
Tom, will you give this
letter to Michael. Please?

831
01:53:34.300 --> 01:53:39.500
If I accepted that, a court could prove
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

832
01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:42.400
He'll get in touch with you.

833
01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:46.200
I let my cab go, so can I
call another one, please?

834
01:53:46.300 --> 01:53:48.100
Come on. Sorry.

835
01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:10.000
- Hello?
- Is Carlo there?

836
01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:13.300
- Who is this?
- A friend of Carlo.

837
01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:16.800
Tell him that I can't make
it tonight until later.

838
01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:23.800
Bitch!

839
01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:28.600
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry.

840
01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:32.000
- The food is getting cold.
- I'll eat out later.

841
01:54:32.100 --> 01:54:35.400
- You just told me to make you dinner!
- Vafangool!

842
01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:37.800
I'll vafangool you!

843
01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:45.400
She has a filthy mouth,
this Guinea brat.

844
01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:54.100
That's it, break it all, you
spoiled Guinea brat. Break it all!

845
01:55:03.300 --> 01:55:06.400
Why don't you bring your
whore home for dinner?

846
01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:09.100
Maybe I will.

847
01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:19.000
- Clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

848
01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:23.000
You skinny, spoiled brat. Clean it up!
Clean it up!

849
01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:27.600
Clean it up! I said, clean it up!
Clean it up!

850
01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:32.500
Clean it up. Clean
that up, you...

851
01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:37.500
Clean it!

852
01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:41.800
Clean it up! Yeah, kill me. Be
a murderer, like your father!

853
01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:45.400
- All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

854
01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:47.200
Come on, kill me!

855
01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:50.400
Get out of here!

856
01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:53.900
- I hate you!
- Now I'll kill you.

857
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.700
You Guinea brat.
Get out of here!

858
01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:10.100
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you.

859
01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:14.300
Connie, talk louder.
The baby's crying.

860
01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:17.300
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

861
01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:20.300
Yeah, Connie.

862
01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
You wait there.

863
01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:32.100
No, you just wait there.

864
01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:36.600
Son-of-a-bitch.

865
01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:39.900
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What's the matter?

866
01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.100
Open the goddamn gate!
Get off your ass.

867
01:56:55.100 --> 01:56:56.400
Sonny!

868
01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:04.800
- Sonny.
- Get out of here!

869
01:57:05.900 --> 01:57:07.800
Go after him, go on!

870
01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:39.600
Son-of-a-bitch. Come on!

871
01:59:28.300 --> 01:59:30.100
Give me a drop.

872
01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:40.800
My wife is crying upstairs.

873
01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:45.700
I hear cars coming to the house.

874
01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:53.300
Consigliere of mine,

875
01:59:53.400 --> 01:59:56.900
tell your Don what
everyone seems to know.

876
01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.400
I didn't tell Mama anything.

877
02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:03.600
I was about to come up and
wake you and tell you.

878
02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:09.300
But you needed a drink first.

879
02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:12.900
Yeah.

880
02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:18.700
Well, now you've had your drink.

881
02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:28.100
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

882
02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:47.700
I want no inquiries made.

883
02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:54.700
I want no acts of vengeance.

884
02:00:56.400 --> 02:00:59.200
I want you to arrange a meeting

885
02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:02.900
with the heads of
the five families.

886
02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:06.900
This war stops now.

887
02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:31.400
Call Bonasera.

888
02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:33.600
I need him now.

889
02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:51.200
This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for
Vito Corleone, at his request.

890
02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:53.600
You owe your Don a service.

891
02:01:53.700 --> 02:01:57.300
He has no doubt that
you will repay it.

892
02:01:57.300 --> 02:01:59.500
He will be at your funeral
parlor in one hour.

893
02:01:59.500 --> 02:02:01.700
Be there to greet him.

894
02:02:22.900 --> 02:02:27.700
Well, my friend, are you
ready to do me this service?

895
02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:30.800
Yes. What do you want me to do?

896
02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:43.700
I want you to use all your
powers and all your skills.

897
02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:50.800
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

898
02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:09.900
Look how they massacred my boy.

899
02:03:38.900 --> 02:03:42.200
It's safer to teach you English!

900
02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:44.400
I know English...

901
02:03:44.500 --> 02:03:49.200
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

902
02:03:56.500 --> 02:03:58.300
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

903
02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
How are things in Palermo?

904
02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:11.000
Michael is teaching me to drive...
watch, I'll show you.

905
02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:15.700
How are things in Palermo?

906
02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:19.200
Young people don't respect
anything anymore...

907
02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:23.600
times are changing
for the worse.

908
02:04:25.900 --> 02:04:29.300
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

909
02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:37.200
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa... right now.

910
02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:44.300
What's wrong?

911
02:04:45.500 --> 02:04:47.700
Bad news from America.

912
02:04:50.100 --> 02:04:53.900
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.

913
02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:02.300
Let's go... you promised.

914
02:05:21.100 --> 02:05:22.100
Fabrizio!

915
02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:23.600
Get the car.

916
02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:29.100
Are you driving yourself, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?

917
02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:32.800
No, take her to her father's
house until things are safe.

918
02:05:32.900 --> 02:05:34.800
Okay, anything you say.

919
02:05:40.700 --> 02:05:42.500
Calo, where is Apollonia?

920
02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:46.700
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

921
02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.100
She'll make a good
American wife.

922
02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:55.100
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

923
02:06:05.300 --> 02:06:07.500
Fabrizio!

924
02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:09.300
Where are you going?

925
02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.400
Wait there! I'll drive to you.

926
02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:20.900
No, Apollonia!

927
02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:49.800
Don Barzini, I want to thank you for
helping me organize this meeting,

928
02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:54.800
and the other heads of the five
families from New York and New Jersey.

929
02:06:56.600 --> 02:06:59.700
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

930
02:06:59.800 --> 02:07:03.100
and from Brooklyn

931
02:07:04.700 --> 02:07:06.800
Philip Tattaglia.

932
02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:11.300
And from Staten Island

933
02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:14.900
we have with us Victor Strachi.

934
02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:20.600
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City

935
02:07:20.700 --> 02:07:24.500
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

936
02:07:31.300 --> 02:07:34.800
How did things ever get so far?

937
02:07:34.900 --> 02:07:36.500
I don't know.

938
02:07:38.500 --> 02:07:42.000
It was so unfortunate,
so unnecessary.

939
02:07:45.200 --> 02:07:48.600
Tattaglia lost a son,
and I lost a son.

940
02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:54.500
We're quits. And if
Tattaglia agrees,

941
02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:58.500
then I'm willing to let
things go on as before.

942
02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:03.600
We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

943
02:08:03.700 --> 02:08:09.100
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

944
02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:13.300
Yes, Don Barzini.
He's too modest.

945
02:08:13.300 --> 02:08:17.600
He had all the judges and
politicians in his pocket.

946
02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:20.500
He refused to share them.

947
02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:24.400
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

948
02:08:24.500 --> 02:08:26.900
All of you know me.

949
02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:32.900
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

950
02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:40.500
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

951
02:08:40.500 --> 02:08:44.800
It's not like gambling
or liquor or even women,

952
02:08:44.900 --> 02:08:50.800
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

953
02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:55.700
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

954
02:08:55.800 --> 02:09:00.000
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

955
02:09:00.100 --> 02:09:05.200
I believed that then and
I believe that now.

956
02:09:05.300 --> 02:09:07.500
Times have changed.

957
02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:12.300
It's not like the old days, when
we could do anything we wanted.

958
02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:15.300
A refusal is not the
act of a friend.

959
02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:20.800
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

960
02:09:20.900 --> 02:09:25.500
or let others use them. He must let
us draw the water from the well.

961
02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:30.100
Certainly he can present a
bill for such services.

962
02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:32.800
After all, we're not communists.

963
02:09:35.900 --> 02:09:39.000
I also don't believe in drugs.

964
02:09:39.100 --> 02:09:44.000
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

965
02:09:44.100 --> 02:09:47.200
Somebody says to them
" I have powders."

966
02:09:47.300 --> 02:09:50.500
" If you put up 3-4,000
dollar investment,

967
02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:53.600
we can make 50,000
distributing."

968
02:09:54.800 --> 02:10:00.700
They can't resist. I want to control
it as a business, keep it respectable.

969
02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:05.600
I don't want it near schools, I
don't want it sold to children.

970
02:10:05.700 --> 02:10:07.500
Thats an infàmia.

971
02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:12.800
In my city we would keep the
traffic to the colored.

972
02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:16.100
They're animals, so let
them lose their souls.

973
02:10:22.700 --> 02:10:26.300
I hoped that we could come
here and reason together.

974
02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:34.300
And I'm willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

975
02:10:34.900 --> 02:10:39.500
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

976
02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:43.800
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

977
02:10:43.900 --> 02:10:47.700
I must have strict
assurance from Corleone.

978
02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:51.000
As time goes by and his
position becomes stronger,

979
02:10:51.100 --> 02:10:53.800
will he attempt any
individual vendetta?

980
02:10:53.900 --> 02:10:59.000
We are all reasonable men. We
don't have to give assurances.

981
02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:02.000
You talk about vengeance.

982
02:11:02.100 --> 02:11:05.300
Will vengeance bring
your son back to you?

983
02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:07.900
Or my boy to me?

984
02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.800
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

985
02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:15.900
But I have selfish reasons.

986
02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:21.800
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country

987
02:11:23.700 --> 02:11:26.200
because of this
Sollozzo business.

988
02:11:27.700 --> 02:11:31.700
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

989
02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:34.400
Cleared of all these
false charges.

990
02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:39.000
But I'm a superstitious man.

991
02:11:39.100 --> 02:11:44.400
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer,

992
02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:49.400
or if he should hang
himself in his jail cell,

993
02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:52.300
or if he's struck by
a bolt of lightning,

994
02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:57.200
then I'm going to blame some
of the people in this room.

995
02:11:58.900 --> 02:12:01.200
And that I do not forgive.

996
02:12:03.700 --> 02:12:06.000
But, that aside

997
02:12:09.100 --> 02:12:11.500
let me say that I swear

998
02:12:13.100 --> 02:12:16.200
on the souls of
my grandchildren,

999
02:12:16.300 --> 02:12:20.700
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1000
02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:51.600
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

1001
02:12:51.700 --> 02:12:53.800
Mention it. Don't insist.

1002
02:12:55.800 --> 02:13:00.800
- Barzini will know without being told.
- You mean Tattaglia.

1003
02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:04.300
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1004
02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:08.600
He could never have
outfought Santino.

1005
02:13:10.900 --> 02:13:16.500
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

1006
02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.100
Come on, Nancy.

1007
02:13:35.300 --> 02:13:37.900
Keep together, everyone. Brian.

1008
02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:40.900
Okay, all right.

1009
02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.200
How long have you been back?

1010
02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:58.800
I've been back a year.

1011
02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:02.400
Longer than that, I think.

1012
02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:07.400
It's good to see you, Kay.

1013
02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:21.000
I'm working for my
father now, Kay.

1014
02:14:23.500 --> 02:14:26.500
He's been sick. Very sick.

1015
02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
But you're not like him.

1016
02:14:30.100 --> 02:14:33.900
You told me you weren't going
to become like your father.

1017
02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:40.100
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

1018
02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:43.600
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1019
02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:47.200
Like a senator or president.

1020
02:14:47.300 --> 02:14:49.800
- How naive you sound.
- Why?

1021
02:14:49.900 --> 02:14:52.700
They don't have men killed.

1022
02:14:56.100 --> 02:14:58.100
Who's being naive, Kay?

1023
02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:03.600
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

1024
02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:09.600
In five years the Corleone family is
going to be completely legitimate.

1025
02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:15.400
Trust me. That's all I can tell
you about my business. Kay...

1026
02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:19.900
Michael, why did you come here?
Why?

1027
02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:23.700
What do you want with
me after all this time?

1028
02:15:23.700 --> 02:15:26.100
I've been calling and writing.

1029
02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:29.700
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

1030
02:15:29.700 --> 02:15:33.600
- Please stop it, Michael.
- Because... I want you to marry me.

1031
02:15:35.300 --> 02:15:37.900
- It's too late.
- Please, Kay...

1032
02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:43.500
I'll do anything you ask to make
up for what's happened to us.

1033
02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:49.400
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that

1034
02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:54.200
we have each other. That
we have a life together.

1035
02:15:55.800 --> 02:15:58.500
That we have children.
Our children.

1036
02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.200
Kay, I need you.

1037
02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:05.700
And I love you.

1038
02:16:27.900 --> 02:16:31.600
Barzini's people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it!

1039
02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:35.400
- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
- Be patient.

1040
02:16:35.500 --> 02:16:38.600
I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

1041
02:16:38.700 --> 02:16:41.800
- Be patient.
- We must protect ourselves.

1042
02:16:41.900 --> 02:16:45.400
- Let me recruit some new men.
- No.

1043
02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:49.300
- Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
- Mike, you're wrong.

1044
02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:53.000
Don Corleone...

1045
02:16:53.100 --> 02:16:57.200
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

1046
02:16:57.300 --> 02:17:01.300
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

1047
02:17:02.300 --> 02:17:05.000
Michael is now head
of the family.

1048
02:17:05.100 --> 02:17:09.400
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1049
02:17:09.500 --> 02:17:11.800
After we make the move to Nevada

1050
02:17:11.900 --> 02:17:16.300
you can leave the Corleone
family and go on your own.

1051
02:17:16.400 --> 02:17:20.800
- How long will that be?
- Six months.

1052
02:17:20.900 --> 02:17:24.100
Forgive me, but with you gone,

1053
02:17:24.200 --> 02:17:27.000
me and Pete will come
under Barzini's thumb.

1054
02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:32.800
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

1055
02:17:32.900 --> 02:17:35.800
- Do you have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.

1056
02:17:35.900 --> 02:17:38.800
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.

1057
02:17:38.900 --> 02:17:42.100
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

1058
02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:52.400
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

1059
02:17:52.500 --> 02:17:54.800
That's all I can tell you now.

1060
02:17:55.600 --> 02:17:58.200
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1061
02:17:58.300 --> 02:18:01.700
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right-hand man.

1062
02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:06.600
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

1063
02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:09.200
That's no reflection on
Tom, just how I want it.

1064
02:18:09.300 --> 02:18:14.000
If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

1065
02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:37.800
- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1066
02:18:37.900 --> 02:18:40.800
Mike... Why am I out?

1067
02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:45.100
You're not a wartime
consigliere, Tom.

1068
02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:49.600
Things may get rough
with the move.

1069
02:18:49.700 --> 02:18:51.000
Tom.

1070
02:18:56.200 --> 02:19:01.300
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1071
02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:05.500
I thought Santino was a
bad Don, rest in peace.

1072
02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:10.200
Michael has all my
confidence, just as you do.

1073
02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:16.200
But there are reasons why you must have
no part in what is going to happen.

1074
02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:20.300
- Maybe I could help.
- You're out, Tom.

1075
02:20:09.400 --> 02:20:13.700
I can't get over the way
your face looks. So good!

1076
02:20:13.900 --> 02:20:18.400
This doctor did some job. Did Kay
talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!

1077
02:20:18.500 --> 02:20:22.700
Leave them out here. He's
tired and wants to clean up.

1078
02:20:22.700 --> 02:20:25.100
Let me open the door, all right?

1079
02:20:31.300 --> 02:20:36.700
- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.

1080
02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:39.400
- Your brother Freddy.
- Girls?

1081
02:20:43.300 --> 02:20:46.400
I'll be right back.
Keep them occupied.

1082
02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:51.100
- Anything you want, kid, anything.
- Who are the girls?

1083
02:20:52.600 --> 02:20:56.000
- That's for you to find out.
- Get rid of them, Fredo.

1084
02:20:57.500 --> 02:21:02.200
- Hey, Mike...
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

1085
02:21:02.300 --> 02:21:05.000
I'm tired. Get rid
of the band too.

1086
02:21:10.800 --> 02:21:14.100
Hey, take off. Take off.
Let's go.

1087
02:21:14.200 --> 02:21:16.300
Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.

1088
02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.200
Hey, come on! Scram!

1089
02:21:21.800 --> 02:21:25.400
Come on, honey. I don't know what's
the matter with him, Johnny.

1090
02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:26.800
Sorry.

1091
02:21:28.700 --> 02:21:31.300
I don't know. He's tired.

1092
02:21:38.300 --> 02:21:41.400
What happened to Moe Greene?

1093
02:21:41.400 --> 02:21:45.800
He had some business. He said to give
him a call when the party started.

1094
02:21:45.900 --> 02:21:47.800
Well, give him a call.

1095
02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:52.300
- Johnny, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mike.

1096
02:21:52.400 --> 02:21:54.600
- We're proud of you.
- Thanks.

1097
02:21:54.700 --> 02:21:58.300
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

1098
02:21:58.400 --> 02:22:00.600
Well, I owe it all to him.

1099
02:22:01.800 --> 02:22:03.400
He knows how grateful you are.

1100
02:22:03.500 --> 02:22:06.800
That's why he'd like
to ask a favor of you.

1101
02:22:06.800 --> 02:22:08.800
Mike, what can I do?

1102
02:22:09.900 --> 02:22:12.400
We're thinking of
giving up our interests

1103
02:22:12.500 --> 02:22:15.400
in the olive oil business
and settling here.

1104
02:22:16.200 --> 02:22:21.600
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it.

1105
02:22:21.700 --> 02:22:24.400
- Tom!
- Are you sure?

1106
02:22:24.500 --> 02:22:27.500
Moe loves the business. He never
said nothing about selling.

1107
02:22:27.600 --> 02:22:30.300
I'll make him an offer
he can't refuse.

1108
02:22:31.600 --> 02:22:34.000
See, Johnny...

1109
02:22:34.100 --> 02:22:38.300
We figure that entertainment would
draw gamblers to the casino.

1110
02:22:38.400 --> 02:22:42.100
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1111
02:22:45.100 --> 02:22:49.700
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

1112
02:22:50.900 --> 02:22:53.100
We're counting on you.

1113
02:22:55.100 --> 02:22:58.700
Sure, Mike. I'll do
anything for my godfather.

1114
02:22:58.800 --> 02:23:00.100
Good.

1115
02:23:01.700 --> 02:23:06.400
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

1116
02:23:06.400 --> 02:23:09.000
- Good to see you.
- How are you, Moe?

1117
02:23:09.100 --> 02:23:14.200
Have everything? Specially prepared food,
the best dancers, and good credit.

1118
02:23:14.300 --> 02:23:17.900
Draw chips for everybody, so
they can play on the house.

1119
02:23:20.500 --> 02:23:23.300
Is my credit good
enough to buy you out?

1120
02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:26.900
Buy me out?

1121
02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.600
The casino, the hotel.

1122
02:23:29.600 --> 02:23:32.600
The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.

1123
02:23:32.600 --> 02:23:38.100
The Corleone family wants to buy me out?
No, I buy you out.

1124
02:23:38.100 --> 02:23:41.600
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.

1125
02:23:41.600 --> 02:23:45.500
- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unlucky.

1126
02:23:50.300 --> 02:23:52.700
You Guineas make me laugh.

1127
02:23:52.900 --> 02:23:57.500
I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!

1128
02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:02.300
You did that because we
bankrolled your casino

1129
02:24:02.300 --> 02:24:05.000
and the Molinari family
guaranteed his safety.

1130
02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.600
Let's talk business.

1131
02:24:07.700 --> 02:24:10.400
Yes. First of all,
you're all done.

1132
02:24:10.500 --> 02:24:13.000
You don't have that
kind of muscle anymore.

1133
02:24:13.100 --> 02:24:17.500
The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.

1134
02:24:17.600 --> 02:24:21.500
Do you think you can come
to my hotel and take over?

1135
02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:26.600
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

1136
02:24:26.700 --> 02:24:30.200
Is that why you slapped my
brother around in public?

1137
02:24:30.300 --> 02:24:35.100
That was nothing, Mike. Moe
didn't mean nothing by that.

1138
02:24:35.200 --> 02:24:39.400
He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

1139
02:24:39.500 --> 02:24:44.300
I have a business to run. I've
got to kick asses sometimes.

1140
02:24:44.300 --> 02:24:48.200
We had an argument, so I
had to straighten him out.

1141
02:24:48.300 --> 02:24:51.100
You straightened my brother out?

1142
02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:55.700
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.

1143
02:24:55.800 --> 02:24:57.700
What's wrong with you?

1144
02:25:02.600 --> 02:25:05.700
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1145
02:25:06.700 --> 02:25:08.300
Son-of-a-bitch!

1146
02:25:08.400 --> 02:25:13.500
I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones when
you were out with cheerleaders.

1147
02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:16.100
Wait a minute, Moe.
I have an idea.

1148
02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:20.800
Tom, you're the consigliere.
Talk to the Don...

1149
02:25:20.900 --> 02:25:26.300
Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and
Mike is in charge of the family business.

1150
02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:29.700
If you have anything to
say, say it to Michael.

1151
02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:39.400
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1152
02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:41.400
Fredo...

1153
02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:45.400
You're my older brother,
and I love you.

1154
02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:50.800
But don't ever take sides with
anyone against the family again.

1155
02:25:52.300 --> 02:25:53.300
Ever.

1156
02:26:01.500 --> 02:26:05.600
I have to see my father and his
people, so have dinner without me.

1157
02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:12.300
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to
the city, see a show and have dinner.

1158
02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:22.700
Your sister wants to
ask you something.

1159
02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:24.900
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

1160
02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.900
They want you to be
godfather to their boy.

1161
02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:29.900
- We'll see.
- Will you?

1162
02:26:29.900 --> 02:26:32.300
Let me think about it. Come on.

1163
02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:44.000
Barzini will move
against you first.

1164
02:26:44.100 --> 02:26:48.500
He'll set up a meeting with
someone you absolutely trust.

1165
02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:50.700
Guaranteeing your safety.

1166
02:26:51.900 --> 02:26:55.000
And at that meeting
you'll be assassinated.

1167
02:26:59.700 --> 02:27:02.700
I like to drink wine
more than I used to.

1168
02:27:04.100 --> 02:27:07.600
- Anyway, I'm drinking more.
- It's good for you, Pop.

1169
02:27:12.700 --> 02:27:14.200
I don't know.

1170
02:27:16.200 --> 02:27:19.200
Are you happy with your
wife and children?

1171
02:27:20.100 --> 02:27:23.000
- Very happy.
- That's good.

1172
02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:29.700
I hope you don't mind the way I keep
going over this Barzini business.

1173
02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:32.800
- No, not at all.
- It's an old habit.

1174
02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:37.200
I spend my life trying
not to be careless.

1175
02:27:38.800 --> 02:27:42.200
Women and children can be
careless, but not men.

1176
02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:47.900
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1177
02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.700
He looks more like
you every day.

1178
02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:57.900
He's smarter than I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.

1179
02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.100
Read the funny papers.

1180
02:28:09.300 --> 02:28:14.900
I want you to arrange for a telephone man
to check all in-and out-going calls.

1181
02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.700
I did it already. I
took care of that, Pop.

1182
02:28:17.700 --> 02:28:20.300
That's right. I forgot.

1183
02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:26.100
What's the matter?

1184
02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:29.000
What's bothering you?

1185
02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:37.200
I'll handle it. I told you I can
handle it, so I'll handle it.

1186
02:28:50.500 --> 02:28:55.000
I knew that Santino would
have to go through all this.

1187
02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:56.700
And Fredo...

1188
02:28:59.400 --> 02:29:01.400
Fredo was, well...

1189
02:29:03.300 --> 02:29:06.100
But I never wanted this for you.

1190
02:29:08.500 --> 02:29:13.500
I worked my whole life. I don't
apologize for taking care of my family.

1191
02:29:13.600 --> 02:29:17.500
And I refused to be a fool,

1192
02:29:17.600 --> 02:29:21.700
dancing on a string held
by all those big shots.

1193
02:29:23.700 --> 02:29:27.200
I don't apologize. That's my
life, but I thought that,

1194
02:29:28.800 --> 02:29:34.000
that when it was your time, you would
be the one to hold the strings.

1195
02:29:35.800 --> 02:29:41.500
Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.
Something.

1196
02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:44.600
Another pezzonovante.

1197
02:29:44.600 --> 02:29:46.300
Well...

1198
02:29:49.500 --> 02:29:53.400
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1199
02:29:53.500 --> 02:29:57.000
We'll get there, Pop.
We'll get there.

1200
02:30:01.900 --> 02:30:06.300
Now listen, whoever comes to
you with this Barzini meeting,

1201
02:30:06.400 --> 02:30:09.400
he's the traitor.
Don't forget that.

1202
02:30:26.300 --> 02:30:28.500
Can I hold it, please?

1203
02:30:43.600 --> 02:30:47.400
- Can I water these?
- Yes, go ahead.

1204
02:30:47.500 --> 02:30:50.300
Over here, over here.

1205
02:30:52.200 --> 02:30:54.700
Be careful. You're spilling it.

1206
02:31:01.100 --> 02:31:02.800
Anthony!

1207
02:31:02.900 --> 02:31:04.600
Come here, come here.

1208
02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:12.400
That's it. We'll put
it right there.

1209
02:31:17.600 --> 02:31:20.200
I'll show you something.
Come here.

1210
02:31:22.300 --> 02:31:24.200
Stand there.

1211
02:31:27.900 --> 02:31:29.700
Give me an orange!

1212
02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:49.800
That's a new trick.

1213
02:31:50.800 --> 02:31:53.100
You run in there. Run in there.

1214
02:32:06.700 --> 02:32:08.700
Where are you?

1215
02:35:06.300 --> 02:35:08.700
Mike, can I have a minute?

1216
02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:21.300
Barzini wants to
arrange a meeting.

1217
02:35:21.300 --> 02:35:24.600
He says we can straighten
out any of our problems.

1218
02:35:25.300 --> 02:35:27.500
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1219
02:35:28.900 --> 02:35:32.700
I can arrange security.
On my territory.

1220
02:35:35.700 --> 02:35:38.200
- All right?
- All right.

1221
02:35:55.800 --> 02:35:58.700
Do you know how they're
going to come at you?

1222
02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:04.900
They're arranging a meeting in Brooklyn.
Tessio's ground.

1223
02:36:07.100 --> 02:36:08.900
Where I'll be safe.

1224
02:36:21.100 --> 02:36:24.700
I always thought it would
be Clemenza, not Tessio.

1225
02:36:24.800 --> 02:36:28.600
It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.

1226
02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:32.100
But I'm going to wait.

1227
02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:33.800
After the baptism.

1228
02:36:37.700 --> 02:36:41.300
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

1229
02:36:41.300 --> 02:36:45.500
And then I'll meet with Don
Barzini and Tattaglia.

1230
02:36:47.100 --> 02:36:50.100
All the heads of
the five families.

1231
02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:16.000
Michael, do you believe in God, the
Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?

1232
02:39:16.100 --> 02:39:17.300
I do.

1233
02:39:17.300 --> 02:39:20.800
Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?

1234
02:39:20.900 --> 02:39:21.900
I do.

1235
02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:26.100
Do you believe in the Holy
Ghost, the Holy Catholic Church?

1236
02:39:26.100 --> 02:39:27.400
I do.

1237
02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:37.300
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

1238
02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:44.800
I do renounce him.

1239
02:40:54.500 --> 02:40:55.900
And all his works?

1240
02:41:09.800 --> 02:41:10.900
I do renounce them.

1241
02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:13.900
Oh, God!

1242
02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:20.500
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

1243
02:41:36.200 --> 02:41:40.400
Michael Rizzi, will
you be baptized?

1244
02:41:40.500 --> 02:41:41.700
I will.

1245
02:41:48.900 --> 02:41:54.400
Michael Rizzi, go in peace, and
may the Lord be with you. Amen.

1246
02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:10.500
Kay!

1247
02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:12.600
Kiss your godfather.

1248
02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:41.000
Can't go to Vegas.
Something's come up.

1249
02:42:41.100 --> 02:42:42.800
Everybody has to
leave without us.

1250
02:42:42.900 --> 02:42:45.800
- Mike, it's our first vacation!
- Connie, please.

1251
02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:49.500
Go back to the house, wait for my call.
It's important.

1252
02:42:50.600 --> 02:42:53.000
I'll only be a couple of days.

1253
02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:11.400
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1254
02:43:13.600 --> 02:43:17.400
- I hope Mike can get us a good deal.
- I'm sure he will.

1255
02:43:25.200 --> 02:43:30.600
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a
separate car, so you two go on ahead.

1256
02:43:30.700 --> 02:43:34.200
- That screws up my arrangements.
- That's what he said.

1257
02:43:34.300 --> 02:43:36.500
I can't go either, Sal.

1258
02:43:48.400 --> 02:43:52.400
Tell Mike it was only business.
I always liked him.

1259
02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.900
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

1260
02:44:02.900 --> 02:44:05.300
Tom, can you get
me off the hook?

1261
02:44:06.500 --> 02:44:09.700
- For old times' sake?
- Can't do it, Sally.

1262
02:44:55.100 --> 02:44:57.900
You have to answer
for Santino, Carlo.

1263
02:45:02.800 --> 02:45:06.700
- Mike, you got it all wrong.
- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.

1264
02:45:07.800 --> 02:45:11.700
That little farce you
played with my sister.

1265
02:45:11.800 --> 02:45:16.900
- You think that could fool a Corleone?
- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

1266
02:45:16.900 --> 02:45:19.700
- Please, don't do this.
- Sit down.

1267
02:45:22.300 --> 02:45:24.600
Don't do this to me, please.

1268
02:45:33.900 --> 02:45:35.600
Barzini is dead.

1269
02:45:37.800 --> 02:45:40.100
So is Philip Tattaglia.

1270
02:45:41.300 --> 02:45:42.800
Moe Greene.

1271
02:45:43.800 --> 02:45:47.600
Strachi. Cuneo.

1272
02:45:49.500 --> 02:45:54.800
Today I settle all family business, so
don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

1273
02:45:54.900 --> 02:45:56.600
Admit what you did.

1274
02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:02.200
Get him a drink.

1275
02:46:08.500 --> 02:46:09.800
Come on.

1276
02:46:11.200 --> 02:46:13.600
Don't be afraid, Carlo.

1277
02:46:13.700 --> 02:46:16.500
Do you think I'd make
my sister a widow?

1278
02:46:17.700 --> 02:46:20.400
I'm godfather to
your son, Carlo.

1279
02:46:27.300 --> 02:46:29.300
Go ahead, drink, drink.

1280
02:46:34.100 --> 02:46:38.000
No, you're out of the family business.
That's your punishment.

1281
02:46:39.100 --> 02:46:43.000
You're finished. I'm putting
you on a plane to Vegas.

1282
02:46:43.100 --> 02:46:44.700
Tom.

1283
02:46:48.900 --> 02:46:52.500
I want you to stay there.
Understand?

1284
02:46:52.500 --> 02:46:55.100
Only don't tell me
you're innocent.

1285
02:46:56.400 --> 02:47:00.600
Because it insults my intelligence.
Makes me very angry.

1286
02:47:04.900 --> 02:47:06.900
Who approached you?

1287
02:47:08.200 --> 02:47:10.400
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1288
02:47:18.300 --> 02:47:20.000
It was Barzini.

1289
02:47:24.200 --> 02:47:25.700
Good.

1290
02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:36.000
There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.

1291
02:47:36.100 --> 02:47:39.600
I'll call your wife and tell
her what flight you're on.

1292
02:47:43.900 --> 02:47:46.500
- Mike...
- Get out of my sight.

1293
02:48:12.600 --> 02:48:14.200
Hello, Carlo.

1294
02:49:14.100 --> 02:49:17.200
- I'm trying to tell you...
- Mama, please!

1295
02:49:25.600 --> 02:49:27.700
Michael!

1296
02:49:27.800 --> 02:49:29.800
- What is it?
- Where is he?

1297
02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:37.300
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.

1298
02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:41.500
You waited until Papa died,
so nobody could stop you.

1299
02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:44.700
You blamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.

1300
02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:50.600
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?

1301
02:49:50.600 --> 02:49:52.300
Connie.

1302
02:49:54.500 --> 02:49:57.200
Why do you think he
kept Carlo at the Mall?

1303
02:49:57.300 --> 02:50:00.100
He knew he was
going to kill him.

1304
02:50:00.200 --> 02:50:05.600
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold-hearted bastard!

1305
02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:09.700
Want to know how many men he had
killed with Carlo? Read the papers!

1306
02:50:09.800 --> 02:50:12.600
That's your husband,
that's your husband!

1307
02:50:22.200 --> 02:50:26.500
No! No, no...

1308
02:50:26.500 --> 02:50:29.900
Take her upstairs.
Get her a doctor.

1309
02:50:51.100 --> 02:50:52.800
She's hysterical.

1310
02:50:57.300 --> 02:50:59.100
Hysterical.

1311
02:51:01.100 --> 02:51:02.800
Michael, is it true?

1312
02:51:04.800 --> 02:51:08.500
- Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
- Is it true?

1313
02:51:08.500 --> 02:51:11.300
Don't ask me about my business.
Enough!

1314
02:51:31.400 --> 02:51:32.900
All right.

1315
02:51:35.700 --> 02:51:37.400
This one time.

1316
02:51:41.400 --> 02:51:44.700
This one time I'll let you
ask me about my affairs.

1317
02:51:50.800 --> 02:51:52.300
Is it true?

1318
02:51:56.300 --> 02:51:57.800
Is it?

1319
02:51:59.600 --> 02:52:01.000
No.

1320
02:52:14.900 --> 02:52:17.900
I guess we both need a drink.
Come on.

1321
02:52:49.100 --> 02:52:50.900
Don Corleone.
