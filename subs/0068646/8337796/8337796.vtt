1
00:42:32.074 --> 00:42:33.492
I know you.

2
00:42:34.343 --> 00:42:37.805
You have been talking to the Tattaglia family... right?

3
00:42:38.806 --> 00:42:43.506
I think you and I can do business.

4
00:42:44.604 --> 00:42:47.440
I need someone strong like you.

5
00:42:47.982 --> 00:42:50.777
I heard you are not happy...

6
00:42:51.319 --> 00:42:53.446
...with the Corleone family.

7
00:42:53.723 --> 00:42:56.623
Want to join me?

8
00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.361
What's in it for me?

9
00:43:00.077 --> 00:43:03.539
$50,000 to start with.

10
00:43:07.434 --> 00:43:08.685
Not bad!

11
00:43:09.545 --> 00:43:11.297
Agreed?

12
01:25:25.193 --> 01:25:26.633
                                                                                I’m sorry about...
It’s alright.

13
01:25:30.924 --> 01:25:32.364
You gotta know...

14
01:25:32.934 --> 01:25:37.784
The hit taken out on your father was just business.

15
01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:41.200
Look... I have much respect for your father.

16
01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:44.885
But his thinking is outdated!

17
01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:51.000
And you have to understand... I am a man of honor.

18
01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:54.620
I under... stand.

19
01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:57.630
Very clearly.                                               I’m glad.

20
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:15.750
And you need to be clear... on why I’m working with the Tattaglia family.

21
01:26:17.175 --> 01:26:20.615
All I want is peace. Violence is costly.

22
01:26:22.047 --> 01:26:23.407
As you well know.

23
01:26:24.783 --> 01:26:27.183
Now let’s stop this nonsense.

24
01:26:27.604 --> 01:26:29.704
I want to um...

25
01:26:31.534 --> 01:26:32.534
What?

26
01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:35.600
How do I say this...

27
01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:50.300
You okay?

28
01:28:52.917 --> 01:28:54.917
Okay, I want you to understand something...

29
01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:56.800
You’re Italian just like your father.

30
01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:01.100
Your father’s in bad shape.

31
01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:07.500
Surely you can see that when he’s better he will need your help.

32
01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:09.500
This fighting has to end.

33
01:29:11.250 --> 01:29:13.550
You need to help me so we can end this.

34
01:37:39.604 --> 01:37:42.065
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

35
01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:49.822
Why are you so far
from the house?

36
01:37:50.364 --> 01:37:52.992
You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.

37
01:37:53.076 --> 01:37:54.452
The bodyguards are here.

38
01:37:55.286 --> 01:37:57.371
It's still dangerous...

39
01:37:57.663 --> 01:38:00.666
We've heard from Santino
in New York...

40
01:38:00.875 --> 01:38:03.169
Your enemies know you're here.

41
01:38:04.295 --> 01:38:07.465
Did Santino say when
I can go back?

42
01:38:07.715 --> 01:38:09.425
Not yet.

43
01:38:09.592 --> 01:38:11.469
It's out of the question.

44
01:38:14.806 --> 01:38:16.432
Where are you going now?

45
01:38:17.892 --> 01:38:18.976
To Corleone.

46
01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:20.812
Take my car.

47
01:38:24.232 --> 01:38:25.274
I want to walk.

48
01:38:28.152 --> 01:38:29.237
Be careful.

49
01:39:03.646 --> 01:39:04.897
Where have all the men gone?

50
01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:08.234
They're all dead from vendettas.

51
01:39:09.735 --> 01:39:12.238
There are the names of the dead.

52
01:39:28.754 --> 01:39:32.675
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!

53
01:39:32.758 --> 01:39:37.180
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!
Clark Gable!

54
01:39:37.305 --> 01:39:42.602
America! Take me to the America, G.I.!
Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!

55
01:40:00.453 --> 01:40:02.580
Mamma mia what a beauty.

56
01:40:10.796 --> 01:40:13.883
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

57
01:40:19.847 --> 01:40:23.851
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

58
01:40:47.708 --> 01:40:48.876
Did you have a good hunt?

59
01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:52.046
You know all the girls
around here?

60
01:40:52.713 --> 01:40:54.090
We saw some real beauties.

61
01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:58.469
One of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

62
01:41:01.806 --> 01:41:04.475
She would tempt the devil himself.

63
01:41:12.024 --> 01:41:14.235
Really put together.

64
01:41:14.318 --> 01:41:15.403
Right, Calo?

65
01:41:19.156 --> 01:41:21.492
Such hair, such mouth!

66
01:41:23.411 --> 01:41:27.081
The girls around here are
beautiful... but virtuous.

67
01:41:27.206 --> 01:41:29.667
This one had a purple dress...

68
01:41:29.875 --> 01:41:32.044
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

69
01:41:32.878 --> 01:41:36.090
A type more Greek than Italian.

70
01:41:38.759 --> 01:41:40.011
Do you know her?

71
01:41:44.932 --> 01:41:47.685
There's no girl like that... in this town.

72
01:41:50.313 --> 01:41:51.564
My God, I understand!

73
01:41:55.693 --> 01:41:56.736
What's wrong?

74
01:41:58.946 --> 01:42:00.239
Let's go.

75
01:42:02.408 --> 01:42:03.784
It's his daughter.

76
01:42:04.076 --> 01:42:05.453
Tell him to come here.

77
01:42:08.914 --> 01:42:10.082
Call him.

78
01:42:30.144 --> 01:42:32.563
Fabrizio, you translate.

79
01:43:37.628 --> 01:43:41.674
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

80
01:43:47.054 --> 01:43:48.681
What's her name?

81
02:03:41.998 --> 02:03:45.293
It's safer to teach you English!

82
02:03:46.002 --> 02:03:47.253
I know English...

83
02:03:47.378 --> 02:03:52.342
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

84
02:03:59.307 --> 02:04:01.309
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

85
02:04:01.934 --> 02:04:03.936
How are things in Palermo?

86
02:04:10.026 --> 02:04:16.072
Michael is teaching me to drive... watch, I'll show you.

87
02:04:16.741 --> 02:04:18.534
How are things in Palermo?

88
02:04:19.077 --> 02:04:22.246
Young people don't respect anything any more...

89
02:04:22.689 --> 02:04:25.901
times are changing for the worse.

90
02:04:27.536 --> 02:04:35.040
This place has become too dangerous for you.

91
02:04:36.070 --> 02:04:42.370
I want you to move to a villa near Siracusa... right now.

92
02:04:45.670 --> 02:04:46.797
What's wrong?

93
02:04:48.314 --> 02:04:50.914
Bad news from America.

94
02:04:52.172 --> 02:04:56.172
Your brother, Santino... they killed him.

95
02:05:03.329 --> 02:05:05.373
Let's go... you promised.

96
02:05:25.601 --> 02:05:26.894
Get the car.

97
02:05:43.703 --> 02:05:45.329
Calo, where is Apollonia?

98
02:05:46.330 --> 02:05:49.709
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

99
02:05:52.003 --> 02:05:54.130
She'll make a good American wife.

100
02:05:55.548 --> 02:05:58.217
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

101
02:06:10.521 --> 02:06:12.440
Where are you going?

102
02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:15.900
Wait there! I'll drive to you.
