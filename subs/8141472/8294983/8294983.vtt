00:00:39.537 --> 00:00:45.423
<i>My faith</i>
<i>looks up to thee,</i>

2
00:00:45.508 --> 00:00:53.690
<i>thou Lamb of Cavalry,</i>
<i>Savior divine.</i>

3
00:00:57.197 --> 00:01:03.125
<i>Now hear me while I pray.</i>

4
00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:08.469
<i>Take all my guilt away.</i>

5
00:01:08.554 --> 00:01:18.406
<i>O let me from this</i>
<i>day be wholly thine.</i>

6
00:01:29.762 --> 00:01:31.390
Good morning.

7
00:01:31.473 --> 00:01:32.685
Welcome, friends.

8
00:01:32.768 --> 00:01:34.689
Now, more than ever,
it is time to turn

9
00:01:34.772 --> 00:01:39.574
the focus of our charity to
those that are closest to us,

10
00:01:39.657 --> 00:01:43.372
to those that are
right outside our door.

11
00:01:43.456 --> 00:01:48.550
The enemies of justice
attack us at every turn.

12
00:01:48.634 --> 00:01:50.596
How do we fight
them, you may ask.

13
00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:53.894
You may be tempted to
lash out, to meet fire

14
00:01:53.977 --> 00:01:56.775
with fire as they say.

15
00:01:56.858 --> 00:01:58.779
With everything
at our fingertips,

16
00:01:58.862 --> 00:02:00.741
temptation has never
been harder to resist,

17
00:02:00.824 --> 00:02:06.460
which includes the beckoning
call of anger and wrath.

18
00:02:06.544 --> 00:02:07.337
Verse 13.

19
00:02:09.717 --> 00:02:16.773
When tempted, one should not
say God is tempting me for God

20
00:02:16.856 --> 00:02:21.658
cannot be tempted by evil,
nor does he tempt anyone.

21
00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:26.291
But each person was tempted
when they are dragged away

22
00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:29.464
by their own evil desires.

23
00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.472
When desire has conceived,
it gives birth to sin.

24
00:02:33.557 --> 00:02:37.648
And sin, when fully grown,
gives birth to death.

25
00:02:37.732 --> 00:02:39.569
Do not be deceived, my
brothers and sisters.

26
00:02:42.575 --> 00:02:47.835
Every good and perfect
gift comes from above,

27
00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:54.014
coming down from the father
of the heavenly lights, who

28
00:02:54.097 --> 00:02:57.980
does not change like
shifting shadows.

29
00:03:05.788 --> 00:03:08.334
The Lord will protect us.

30
00:03:22.655 --> 00:03:24.784
Forgive me.

31
00:03:24.867 --> 00:03:28.583
I'm feeling a little
under the weather.

32
00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:31.756
Please stand for our
next hymn, which you will

33
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.384
find printed in your bulletins.

34
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.905
Thank you.

35
00:03:45.534 --> 00:03:46.243
Thank you.

36
00:03:52.548 --> 00:03:54.802
Get well soon, pastor.

37
00:03:54.886 --> 00:03:56.138
Thank you.

38
00:03:56.221 --> 00:03:57.432
Will do, kiddo.

39
00:04:00.898 --> 00:04:01.398
Thanks.

40
00:04:10.082 --> 00:04:13.172
I pray to you,
Lord, for guidance.

41
00:04:13.255 --> 00:04:17.681
So will my word be which
goes forth from my mouth.

42
00:04:17.765 --> 00:04:24.027
It will not return to me
empty without accomplishing

43
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.824
what I desire and succeeding in
the manner for which I sent it.

44
00:04:32.628 --> 00:04:34.715
What if you lose it?

45
00:04:34.799 --> 00:04:38.138
It's all I wanted,
all I've known.

46
00:04:40.852 --> 00:04:41.813
What if I was wrong?

47
00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:46.321
What if this is no
longer my destiny?

48
00:04:51.206 --> 00:04:54.588
Jesus gave his
life for our sins.

49
00:04:54.672 --> 00:04:56.174
What has humanity
done to thank him?

50
00:05:00.182 --> 00:05:01.853
Why did you send
your son for us?

51
00:05:05.902 --> 00:05:09.660
For if God did not spare
angels, when they sin,

52
00:05:09.744 --> 00:05:11.831
sent them to hell to be
put in chains of darkness

53
00:05:11.914 --> 00:05:12.916
to be held for judgment.

54
00:05:19.387 --> 00:05:20.056
I'm so lost.

55
00:05:25.232 --> 00:05:26.401
Please tell me what to do.

56
00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:37.423
Oh, Lord, please answer me.

57
00:05:46.316 --> 00:05:49.197
Pastor Kurt, there was
an accident outside,

58
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.368
and Andy Hammond is dead.

59
00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:53.122
The driver didn't even stop.

60
00:05:58.842 --> 00:05:59.802
He's so helpless.

61
00:07:02.594 --> 00:07:05.517
<i>Divided we fall.</i>

62
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.731
<i>to make us heroes.</i>

63
00:07:08.815 --> 00:07:11.654
<i>to make us heroes.</i>

64
00:07:12.656 --> 00:07:16.371
<i>to make us heroes.</i>

65
00:07:16.454 --> 00:07:18.543
<i>to make us heroes.</i>

66
00:07:18.626 --> 00:07:24.095
<i>burn it all down.</i>

67
00:07:24.178 --> 00:07:26.141
<i>Burn it all down.</i>

68
00:07:32.654 --> 00:07:34.658
<i>You'll burn it all down.</i>

69
00:07:41.171 --> 00:07:43.175
<i>But do we.</i>

70
00:07:50.523 --> 00:07:54.280
<i>Do we heal of</i>
<i>a hate that knows no shame.</i>

71
00:07:54.364 --> 00:07:58.455
<i>Do we heal of</i>
<i>a hate that knows no shame.</i>

72
00:07:58.539 --> 00:08:00.292
<i>In the ashes of tomorrow, in</i>
<i>the new world that begins.</i>

73
00:08:00.376 --> 00:08:07.974
<i>In the ashes of tomorrow, in</i>
<i>the new world that begins.</i>

74
00:08:08.058 --> 00:08:13.986
<i>Please remember all the</i>
<i>sorrow we had to break them</i>

75
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.826
<i>before they bend.</i>

76
00:08:18.746 --> 00:08:25.677
<i>So we follow and</i>
<i>accepted the violence.</i>

77
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:33.275
<i>we have to</i>
<i>stand as one and destroy.</i>

78
00:08:51.311 --> 00:08:53.231
Dirty old egg-sucking raccoons.

79
00:09:16.402 --> 00:09:18.866
Shit, Al, you all right?

80
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.496
I think there's a
fucking bear outside.

81
00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.458
I almost shit my pants.

82
00:09:23.543 --> 00:09:26.464
Are you sure it wasn't Bigfoot?

83
00:09:26.549 --> 00:09:28.803
You want to go out
and investigate?

84
00:09:28.886 --> 00:09:30.472
Jeez.

85
00:09:30.557 --> 00:09:34.146
Now, make yourself useful, Roy.

86
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.232
Break's over.

87
00:09:41.411 --> 00:09:43.541
You guys are going
to love the cottage.

88
00:09:43.624 --> 00:09:47.381
It's really relaxing and remote.

89
00:09:47.464 --> 00:09:50.680
And we have a boat.

90
00:09:50.763 --> 00:09:52.183
Laura, it's the
middle of winter.

91
00:09:52.266 --> 00:09:54.186
We can't even use the boat.

92
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:55.857
Besides, Mom and Dad
always have the keys.

93
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.359
They don't trust us.

94
00:09:57.443 --> 00:09:58.194
Why not?

95
00:09:58.278 --> 00:09:59.698
I have the keys.

96
00:09:59.781 --> 00:10:01.535
That's so unfair.

97
00:10:01.619 --> 00:10:03.371
Mom never lets me
bring anybody there.

98
00:10:03.455 --> 00:10:05.208
Well, probably because
they didn't want stains

99
00:10:05.292 --> 00:10:06.545
on the furniture.

100
00:10:06.629 --> 00:10:11.220
That's probably right.

101
00:10:11.304 --> 00:10:15.228
So, Tim, I hear you
work at a sports store.

102
00:10:15.312 --> 00:10:16.565
Whoa.

103
00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:18.569
I run the sports store.

104
00:10:18.653 --> 00:10:20.238
You own it?

105
00:10:20.322 --> 00:10:21.742
No, I'm the manager.

106
00:10:21.825 --> 00:10:22.911
It's a pretty sweet gig.

107
00:10:22.994 --> 00:10:25.248
Great pay, benefits.

108
00:10:25.332 --> 00:10:28.421
My staff is super cool.

109
00:10:28.506 --> 00:10:30.760
I just found out that
one of my employees

110
00:10:30.843 --> 00:10:33.933
is, like, blowing
everybody at work.

111
00:10:34.016 --> 00:10:35.310
And I'm like, what the fuck?

112
00:10:35.394 --> 00:10:37.356
Why isn't the
manager getting any?

113
00:10:48.378 --> 00:10:49.296
Everything all right, Sam?

114
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.967
No, it's not.

115
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.804
I'm a little pissed
off at you guys, OK?

116
00:10:52.887 --> 00:10:56.477
Because of you guys, I'm
missing Pedro's big bash.

117
00:10:56.562 --> 00:10:56.979
So what?

118
00:10:57.062 --> 00:10:57.522
Big deal.

119
00:10:57.605 --> 00:10:57.981
Yeah.

120
00:10:58.064 --> 00:10:59.316
So what?

121
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.862
So everyone's going
to be there, OK?

122
00:11:00.945 --> 00:11:03.324
I know you don't care, and
you sure as shit don't care,

123
00:11:03.408 --> 00:11:09.003
but somebody of my social
standing, I happen to care.

124
00:11:09.086 --> 00:11:12.342
Let's just take it easy
and have fun today.

125
00:11:12.426 --> 00:11:16.852
As long as I'm stuck with
you two jerk-offs, nah, man.

126
00:11:16.935 --> 00:11:18.856
I don't have enough
cocaine to deal with this.

127
00:11:18.939 --> 00:11:23.908
And on that note, I'm going find
a little bit more right now.

128
00:11:23.991 --> 00:11:28.374
So, Tim, Amy is a
great songwriter.

129
00:11:28.458 --> 00:11:28.876
Flora.

130
00:11:28.959 --> 00:11:29.711
What?

131
00:11:29.795 --> 00:11:31.380
You're a rock star.

132
00:11:31.464 --> 00:11:32.884
Look, she's got this
beautiful voice,

133
00:11:32.967 --> 00:11:34.428
and she's great at guitar.

134
00:11:36.809 --> 00:11:37.560
Awesome.

135
00:11:37.644 --> 00:11:39.731
Let's hear it.

136
00:11:39.815 --> 00:11:40.942
No.

137
00:11:41.025 --> 00:11:41.902
Come on.

138
00:11:41.985 --> 00:11:43.948
I'd love to hear a song.

139
00:11:44.031 --> 00:11:45.450
I'd rather drink cyanide.

140
00:11:45.535 --> 00:11:48.081
All right.

141
00:11:48.164 --> 00:11:49.918
Not just quietly?

142
00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:51.964
No.

143
00:11:52.047 --> 00:11:55.428
Besides, it's not so much
singing as it is screaming.

144
00:11:55.513 --> 00:11:59.436
So being quiet isn't
really an option.

145
00:11:59.521 --> 00:12:02.652
Samuel, we have a
board meeting on Monday

146
00:12:02.735 --> 00:12:04.823
that we have to
get ready for, OK?

147
00:12:04.906 --> 00:12:06.660
Mitch, we have all weekend, OK?

148
00:12:06.743 --> 00:12:08.956
So chill out for once
in your fucking life.

149
00:12:09.039 --> 00:12:10.000
Yeah, that's the point.

150
00:12:10.083 --> 00:12:12.462
We only have the weekend, right?

151
00:12:12.547 --> 00:12:13.799
Mitch, we know, OK?

152
00:12:13.883 --> 00:12:15.468
We know what's on the line.

153
00:12:15.553 --> 00:12:16.847
It'll do you good
to have some fun.

154
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.474
We can drink tonight.

155
00:12:18.559 --> 00:12:20.478
You can listen to your
Creed, your Hoobastank, hey,

156
00:12:20.563 --> 00:12:21.815
now, you're an all-star.

157
00:12:21.899 --> 00:12:22.817
Whatever you want
to do, we'll listen.

158
00:12:22.901 --> 00:12:23.652
Whatever you want, big guy.

159
00:12:23.736 --> 00:12:24.028
Just throw it on.

160
00:12:24.111 --> 00:12:25.030
OK.

161
00:12:25.113 --> 00:12:26.825
Doesn't that sound like fun?

162
00:12:26.909 --> 00:12:29.079
Just a couple of guys, listening
to some Creed, the Hooba.

163
00:12:33.756 --> 00:12:38.515
So how many tattoos
you got anyway?

164
00:12:38.599 --> 00:12:40.686
I've got a bunch.

165
00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.523
What's that one?

166
00:12:42.607 --> 00:12:44.193
It's a tree.

167
00:12:44.276 --> 00:12:46.865
You know, Mother Nature.

168
00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:48.744
Hippie much.

169
00:12:48.827 --> 00:12:50.706
What's the deal with
Mother Nature anyway?

170
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.710
She gets all moody sending
us hurricanes and shit.

171
00:12:52.794 --> 00:12:54.046
It's like, back off, bitch.

172
00:12:54.129 --> 00:12:56.092
We get it.

173
00:12:56.175 --> 00:12:57.887
I think I'm going to
go get the bill now.

174
00:12:57.971 --> 00:13:00.225
No, no, I'll pay.

175
00:13:00.308 --> 00:13:01.561
The man's always got to pay.

176
00:13:01.645 --> 00:13:02.563
Ah, you know what?

177
00:13:02.647 --> 00:13:03.231
I forgot.

178
00:13:03.314 --> 00:13:04.108
I have ovaries.

179
00:13:04.191 --> 00:13:05.068
Thanks, Tim.

180
00:13:05.151 --> 00:13:05.653
Thanks for reminding me.

181
00:13:09.326 --> 00:13:13.752
Maybe a couple brewskis.

182
00:13:13.836 --> 00:13:16.758
And then we buckle
down and get to work.

183
00:13:16.842 --> 00:13:21.768
On that note, please, please,
please, please, please, please.

184
00:13:21.852 --> 00:13:24.941
Look who just texted and
happens to be in town.

185
00:13:25.025 --> 00:13:27.279
My main man Philly is
going to be around,

186
00:13:27.362 --> 00:13:29.283
drop by a little bit of blow.

187
00:13:29.366 --> 00:13:30.619
No.

188
00:13:30.703 --> 00:13:31.788
Is that going to
make you happy, Sam?

189
00:13:31.872 --> 00:13:32.790
Yeah, it's going
to make me happy.

190
00:13:32.874 --> 00:13:33.959
It's going to make me elated.

191
00:13:34.043 --> 00:13:35.963
You should be glad,
and you'll be you,

192
00:13:36.047 --> 00:13:37.633
but everyone's
happy for a change.

193
00:13:37.717 --> 00:13:38.802
Yeah, I will be me.

194
00:13:38.886 --> 00:13:40.138
Who's here now?

195
00:13:40.221 --> 00:13:41.015
Who's in the house?

196
00:13:41.098 --> 00:13:42.643
It's upset Mitch.

197
00:13:42.727 --> 00:13:43.979
You didn't want to meet
him, you met him, OK?

198
00:13:44.063 --> 00:13:45.190
I'm putting my foot down.

199
00:13:45.273 --> 00:13:47.653
Absolutely not, OK?

200
00:13:47.737 --> 00:13:51.828
No, no drugs, OK?

201
00:13:51.912 --> 00:13:52.997
No Philly.

202
00:13:53.081 --> 00:13:53.999
Don't know him.

203
00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:56.003
Don't want to know him, OK?

204
00:13:56.087 --> 00:13:59.343
You want some coke.

205
00:13:59.426 --> 00:14:00.345
I'll get you a Coca-Cola.

206
00:14:00.428 --> 00:14:01.681
Yeah, whatever.

207
00:14:01.765 --> 00:14:04.019
Listen, guy by the
bar over there,

208
00:14:04.103 --> 00:14:07.860
he's been listening to our
conversation this whole time.

209
00:14:07.944 --> 00:14:08.862
And?

210
00:14:08.946 --> 00:14:11.117
And I don't appreciate it.

211
00:14:13.789 --> 00:14:15.041
Hey.

212
00:14:15.125 --> 00:14:16.210
What the fuck, dude?

213
00:14:16.293 --> 00:14:18.882
Sam, you a-hole,
that's not nice.

214
00:14:18.966 --> 00:14:20.385
The fuck you just say to me?

215
00:14:20.468 --> 00:14:23.725
That's-- it was
just

216
00:14:23.809 --> 00:14:25.228
What the fuck is
your problem, dude?

217
00:14:25.311 --> 00:14:25.771
Sorry.

218
00:14:25.855 --> 00:14:26.397
Sorry.

219
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.065
We're sorry.

220
00:14:27.149 --> 00:14:28.234
We're sorry.

221
00:14:28.317 --> 00:14:28.902
Just--

222
00:14:28.986 --> 00:14:29.737
Hey.

223
00:14:29.821 --> 00:14:30.238
Everything's cool.

224
00:14:30.321 --> 00:14:32.075
Limp dick.

225
00:14:32.159 --> 00:14:33.912
Hey.

226
00:14:33.996 --> 00:14:36.793
Don't let him talk
to you like that.

227
00:14:36.877 --> 00:14:38.087
Oh, wow.

228
00:14:38.171 --> 00:14:38.922
Sam.

229
00:14:39.006 --> 00:14:39.423
Sam.

230
00:14:39.507 --> 00:14:41.135
No, no, no.

231
00:14:41.218 --> 00:14:42.930
Mitch, I didn't realize your
boyfriend would be joining us

232
00:14:43.014 --> 00:14:44.266
this weekend.

233
00:14:44.349 --> 00:14:46.395
He should watch his mouth,
mind his own business.

234
00:14:51.363 --> 00:14:52.950
Do I know you, man?

235
00:14:53.034 --> 00:14:55.455
No more than you know him.

236
00:14:55.539 --> 00:14:59.129
Now, what seems to be
the problem, gentlemen?

237
00:14:59.213 --> 00:15:00.465
All the troubles in
the world and you

238
00:15:00.549 --> 00:15:03.805
want to bring violence
to complete strangers.

239
00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:06.018
Over what?

240
00:15:06.101 --> 00:15:07.312
Hm?

241
00:15:07.395 --> 00:15:10.986
You're both bigger
than this, I hope.

242
00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:11.738
Look around.

243
00:15:14.409 --> 00:15:16.873
You look more
foolish than strong.

244
00:15:16.957 --> 00:15:20.004
Now, we all have
journeys to make,

245
00:15:20.088 --> 00:15:22.175
and I suggest you don't
postpone your friend's travels

246
00:15:22.259 --> 00:15:22.927
any further.

247
00:15:27.102 --> 00:15:28.855
It's on me.

248
00:15:28.939 --> 00:15:30.275
Let's call it a night.

249
00:15:40.128 --> 00:15:40.629
Let's go.

250
00:15:45.973 --> 00:15:47.100
Is it almost ready, Mr. Lange?

251
00:15:47.183 --> 00:15:48.227
It's just getting in now.

252
00:15:48.311 --> 00:15:50.440
Good.

253
00:15:50.524 --> 00:15:52.570
Why do you always
have to get into shit?

254
00:15:52.653 --> 00:15:53.572
What?

255
00:15:53.655 --> 00:15:54.574
He was all over that guy.

256
00:15:54.657 --> 00:15:55.909
I had to do something.

257
00:15:55.993 --> 00:15:57.412
Stand up for the
little guy, right?

258
00:15:57.495 --> 00:15:58.915
You weren't protecting anyone.

259
00:15:58.999 --> 00:16:01.295
You were just showing off.

260
00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:02.590
Can we go now?

261
00:16:02.673 --> 00:16:03.257
Yeah.

262
00:16:03.341 --> 00:16:04.176
Yes, please.

263
00:16:18.204 --> 00:16:20.124
I-- I don't think I'm
going to get laid.

264
00:16:20.208 --> 00:16:21.711
Yeah, for once, I
think you're right.

265
00:16:28.725 --> 00:16:30.186
There you go, man.

266
00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:32.482
As much hot teas as we could
pack into these things.

267
00:16:32.566 --> 00:16:34.319
The old boy swears
by this stuff.

268
00:16:34.403 --> 00:16:35.656
Much obliged.

269
00:16:35.739 --> 00:16:38.662
May it bring us comfort
in the night ahead.

270
00:16:38.745 --> 00:16:40.164
Enjoy this night, brother.

271
00:16:40.248 --> 00:16:43.379
It will be long,
and it will be cold.

272
00:16:43.462 --> 00:16:47.011
But the truth shall
lead us to salvation.

273
00:16:47.095 --> 00:16:48.222
Yeah, you, too, man.

274
00:16:48.305 --> 00:16:48.765
Take care.

275
00:16:54.151 --> 00:16:55.612
A lot of weirdos tonight.

276
00:17:19.159 --> 00:17:21.581
So what the fuck are we supposed
to do if the owner comes here?

277
00:17:21.664 --> 00:17:23.417
Don't be such a fucking pussy.

278
00:17:23.502 --> 00:17:26.089
And even if they do, fuck them.

279
00:17:30.849 --> 00:17:32.310
What was that?

280
00:17:32.393 --> 00:17:33.437
Was it Chester?

281
00:17:33.522 --> 00:17:34.272
It can't be.

282
00:17:34.356 --> 00:17:35.274
I tied him up.

283
00:17:35.358 --> 00:17:36.276
I'm going to go check on him.

284
00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.445
Sit the fuck down.

285
00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:38.447
Fuck you.

286
00:17:48.217 --> 00:17:50.471
Twice.

287
00:17:52.225 --> 00:17:52.643
Holy shit.

288
00:17:52.726 --> 00:17:53.394
What the fuck?

289
00:18:13.602 --> 00:18:14.269
Ugh!

290
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.622
I trust you, Pastor
Kurt, but how are

291
00:19:05.706 --> 00:19:08.335
we going to fight this thing?

292
00:19:08.419 --> 00:19:09.797
What can the three of us do?

293
00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.343
I'm not a pastor
anymore, Mr. Lange.

294
00:19:12.427 --> 00:19:14.974
You know that.

295
00:19:15.057 --> 00:19:17.521
But I tell you, we will have
hallowed ground on our side

296
00:19:17.604 --> 00:19:19.315
this very night.

297
00:19:19.399 --> 00:19:20.652
The Lord will help us.

298
00:19:20.736 --> 00:19:21.403
Mr. Waidmann.

299
00:19:23.908 --> 00:19:26.831
The battle ahead is
stacked in our favor.

300
00:19:26.914 --> 00:19:28.500
Mr. Renfield will
drive us to the ground

301
00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:30.839
we must make hallowed.

302
00:19:30.922 --> 00:19:32.926
It is there that we
will make our stand.

303
00:19:43.615 --> 00:19:46.579
Do you feel that?

304
00:19:46.662 --> 00:19:47.623
Feel what?

305
00:19:50.461 --> 00:19:51.296
It's hunting again.

306
00:19:54.135 --> 00:19:55.680
May God have mercy
on their souls.

307
00:20:13.508 --> 00:20:16.764
Y'all, I want you to
have a piece of that pie,

308
00:20:16.848 --> 00:20:18.601
some good ass pie.

309
00:20:18.685 --> 00:20:22.776
We should get some on
the way back home if you

310
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.947
know what you're missing.

311
00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:28.580
Damn pie.

312
00:20:38.558 --> 00:20:40.812
The guy who broke up
the fight was nice.

313
00:20:40.896 --> 00:20:41.898
Mm, yeah.

314
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:48.828
Oh, he kind of spoke
like a priest, you know?

315
00:20:48.912 --> 00:20:49.663
Mm-hmm.

316
00:20:49.747 --> 00:20:51.834
Yeah.

317
00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:54.840
Yeah, a little young
to be a priest.

318
00:20:54.924 --> 00:20:56.677
They can still be
young and be a priest.

319
00:20:56.761 --> 00:20:58.180
Besides, how old do
you think he was?

320
00:20:58.263 --> 00:20:59.516
Like, 45?

321
00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.685
Really?

322
00:21:00.769 --> 00:21:01.687
That old?

323
00:21:01.771 --> 00:21:02.689
What do you mean, "that old"?

324
00:21:02.773 --> 00:21:04.025
I don't know.

325
00:21:04.108 --> 00:21:05.695
I think he's like 36.

326
00:21:05.779 --> 00:21:08.534
OK, the man looked
good, but he was no 36.

327
00:21:08.618 --> 00:21:10.705
This isn't the Twilight Zone.

328
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:13.711
Martin Sloan, age 36, my ass.

329
00:21:13.795 --> 00:21:14.713
What?

330
00:21:14.797 --> 00:21:15.715
Ah, it's an old reference.

331
00:21:15.799 --> 00:21:16.717
You wouldn't get it.

332
00:21:16.801 --> 00:21:18.053
Oh.

333
00:21:18.136 --> 00:21:20.559
So you really thought he was 45?

334
00:21:20.642 --> 00:21:21.936
Yeah, I could tell.

335
00:21:22.019 --> 00:21:24.775
Mandy thinks all white
people look alike.

336
00:21:24.858 --> 00:21:27.238
He was more like 50.

337
00:21:27.321 --> 00:21:28.073
What?

338
00:21:28.156 --> 00:21:28.783
No way.

339
00:21:28.866 --> 00:21:30.077
No, no.

340
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.622
Trust me, I know what
I'm talking about--

341
00:21:31.706 --> 00:21:34.085
Just because you stare
at saggy balls all day

342
00:21:34.168 --> 00:21:35.922
doesn't make you
an expert on age.

343
00:21:36.006 --> 00:21:38.260
Is that what you think
I do in med school?

344
00:21:38.343 --> 00:21:39.596
Oh, my God.

345
00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.932
Is that what you
and your doctor do?

346
00:21:41.016 --> 00:21:41.767
Do they look at your
saggy blue Smurf balls?

347
00:21:41.851 --> 00:21:42.769
Is that what's going on?

348
00:21:42.853 --> 00:21:43.938
Fuck you.

349
00:21:44.022 --> 00:21:45.107
Watch out!

350
00:21:51.369 --> 00:21:52.622
Jesus Christ, Laura!

351
00:21:52.706 --> 00:21:53.958
What?

352
00:21:54.042 --> 00:21:54.960
It would have been safer
just to run it over.

353
00:21:55.044 --> 00:21:57.131
That's terrible, Tim!

354
00:21:57.214 --> 00:21:58.634
What was that?

355
00:21:58.718 --> 00:21:59.302
I don't know.

356
00:21:59.385 --> 00:22:01.849
Some fucking animal.

357
00:22:01.932 --> 00:22:03.310
Why are you slowing down?

358
00:22:03.393 --> 00:22:04.646
I honestly doubt you're
going to hit another animal.

359
00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:05.732
Shit.

360
00:22:12.746 --> 00:22:13.998
I'm out of gas.

361
00:22:17.296 --> 00:22:18.340
What the fuck?

362
00:22:18.423 --> 00:22:19.175
Did you not just fill this up?

363
00:22:19.258 --> 00:22:20.678
Yeah, I did!

364
00:22:20.762 --> 00:22:22.014
That's weird.

365
00:22:22.098 --> 00:22:23.684
Are you sure you got gas?

366
00:22:23.768 --> 00:22:24.728
Yeah.

367
00:22:24.812 --> 00:22:26.189
You put the nozzle in the tank?

368
00:22:26.272 --> 00:22:27.233
Yes.

369
00:22:27.316 --> 00:22:28.861
And it wasn't Manny's nozzle.

370
00:22:28.945 --> 00:22:29.362
Oh, my God.

371
00:22:29.445 --> 00:22:30.114
Tim!

372
00:22:32.786 --> 00:22:34.038
It was probably that
shit-eating-grin

373
00:22:34.122 --> 00:22:35.875
fuckhead from the diner.

374
00:22:35.959 --> 00:22:36.919
Son of a bitch!

375
00:22:37.002 --> 00:22:38.380
How can we be out of gas?

376
00:22:38.463 --> 00:22:39.883
Mitch, I don't know.

377
00:22:39.967 --> 00:22:42.096
OK?

378
00:22:42.179 --> 00:22:44.100
Well, somebody better go
outside and check, huh?

379
00:22:44.183 --> 00:22:45.060
Yeah, somebody.

380
00:22:45.144 --> 00:22:46.104
Somebody as in you.

381
00:22:46.187 --> 00:22:47.733
It's your car,
Sean, so go ahead.

382
00:22:47.816 --> 00:22:49.235
Yeah, but Sam, you
are the car guy.

383
00:22:49.318 --> 00:22:50.738
Ah, no, no, no, no.

384
00:22:50.822 --> 00:22:52.241
See, I'm the guy who
owns the nice cars

385
00:22:52.324 --> 00:22:53.911
purely to get laid, OK?

386
00:22:53.995 --> 00:22:55.080
All right?

387
00:22:55.164 --> 00:22:56.082
I don't know the
first thing about it.

388
00:22:56.166 --> 00:22:57.753
I pay people to check them.

389
00:22:57.836 --> 00:23:00.925
And Mitch, why don't you do
something for a change, huh?

390
00:23:01.009 --> 00:23:02.929
Well, there's snow outside.

391
00:23:03.013 --> 00:23:04.432
You like snow, don't you?

392
00:23:04.516 --> 00:23:06.771
OK, he's
got you there, man.

393
00:23:06.854 --> 00:23:07.939
No, no, don't do that.

394
00:23:08.023 --> 00:23:09.275
You got half of
this up your nose.

395
00:23:09.358 --> 00:23:10.152
Yeah.

396
00:23:10.235 --> 00:23:10.987
Yeah, you know what?

397
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.281
It doesn't matter.

398
00:23:12.364 --> 00:23:13.283
And Mitch, get under
the car now, man.

399
00:23:13.366 --> 00:23:14.452
I'm not fucking around anymore.

400
00:23:14.536 --> 00:23:16.289
OK, OK, Sam, just relax, OK?

401
00:23:16.372 --> 00:23:17.458
Lay off Mitch.

402
00:23:17.542 --> 00:23:18.293
You know what?

403
00:23:18.376 --> 00:23:19.295
I know you know cars.

404
00:23:19.378 --> 00:23:20.130
OK?

405
00:23:20.214 --> 00:23:21.341
I just drive these cars.

406
00:23:21.424 --> 00:23:24.973
So for me, just for
me, just go check.

407
00:23:25.057 --> 00:23:25.975
And for me.

408
00:23:26.059 --> 00:23:28.146
No, Mitch, shut the F up.

409
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:29.232
Just go check, please.

410
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:47.519
Go out in the snow, and
you do all the fucking work.

411
00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.238
I knew he was a pain
in the A in the office,

412
00:23:53.321 --> 00:23:55.200
but is he going to be
like this all weekend?

413
00:23:55.284 --> 00:23:57.371
Mitch, stop being a dad, OK?

414
00:23:57.454 --> 00:23:59.208
You're too married to this job.

415
00:23:59.292 --> 00:24:00.545
The whole point of
this retreat was

416
00:24:00.628 --> 00:24:02.214
for you to have fun to relax.

417
00:24:02.298 --> 00:24:03.216
OK?

418
00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.385
How am I supposed to relax?

419
00:24:04.468 --> 00:24:06.557
You know, Sam is
a really nice guy.

420
00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.228
And so are you, but Sam
can't see that when you're

421
00:24:09.312 --> 00:24:10.397
nitpicking him all the time.

422
00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.902
Why are you defending him?

423
00:24:12.986 --> 00:24:13.571
OK, yeah, I get it.

424
00:24:13.654 --> 00:24:15.575
He does a lot of drugs.

425
00:24:15.658 --> 00:24:17.411
He thinks too highly of himself.

426
00:24:17.494 --> 00:24:19.248
Borderline racist, I noticed.

427
00:24:19.332 --> 00:24:21.085
I noticed that, too.

428
00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:22.421
Me and Sam, we go way back.

429
00:24:22.505 --> 00:24:25.928
And he really helped
me out a lot, Mitch.

430
00:24:26.012 --> 00:24:30.103
He does a lot of coke, and
he gets in a lot of fights.

431
00:24:30.187 --> 00:24:31.230
How did he ever help you?

432
00:24:33.694 --> 00:24:35.113
Oh, my gosh.

433
00:24:35.197 --> 00:24:36.950
I can't believe I'm
telling this to you.

434
00:24:37.034 --> 00:24:40.958
OK, I did a stint
as a social worker.

435
00:24:41.042 --> 00:24:44.465
I really wanted to
help people back then.

436
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:48.056
But there are just some things
you just can't help, Mitch.

437
00:24:50.603 --> 00:24:52.649
Getting laid at Pedro's.

438
00:24:52.732 --> 00:24:54.986
Is that.

439
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.988
Fuck!

440
00:24:56.072 --> 00:24:57.491
God damn it!

441
00:24:57.575 --> 00:25:00.330
So then I just
couldn't do it anymore.

442
00:25:00.414 --> 00:25:02.000
You quit?

443
00:25:02.084 --> 00:25:03.336
Yes, I quit.

444
00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.173
I had no job.

445
00:25:05.257 --> 00:25:06.175
I had no money.

446
00:25:06.259 --> 00:25:07.679
The bills kept on piling up.

447
00:25:07.762 --> 00:25:10.183
Nobody was hiring me.

448
00:25:10.267 --> 00:25:12.564
Sam, he helped me out.

449
00:25:12.647 --> 00:25:15.068
He lent me some cash,
got me this job.

450
00:25:15.152 --> 00:25:16.530
I met you.

451
00:25:16.613 --> 00:25:20.412
Yeah, his ego, the drugs,
they drag him down.

452
00:25:20.495 --> 00:25:24.044
And I really do try
to help him, Mitch.

453
00:25:24.128 --> 00:25:27.552
You know, kind of like the
way I'm trying to help you.

454
00:25:27.635 --> 00:25:29.305
Just relax and have a good time.

455
00:25:35.484 --> 00:25:37.572
You know what that
means, don't you?

456
00:25:37.655 --> 00:25:38.406
What?

457
00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:40.243
What does it mean?

458
00:25:40.327 --> 00:25:42.414
You're a social worker again.

459
00:25:42.498 --> 00:25:42.999
Fuck you.

460
00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.261
What is that?

461
00:25:49.345 --> 00:25:51.307
Oh, you son of a bitch.

462
00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:51.850
Fuck!

463
00:25:57.361 --> 00:25:59.281
Well, whenever you two
ladies are done giggling,

464
00:25:59.365 --> 00:26:00.367
we've got a problem.

465
00:26:01.244 --> 00:26:02.705
What, what, what, what's
wrong with my car?

466
00:26:02.914 --> 00:26:04.291
Somebody cut the fuel line.

467
00:26:04.375 --> 00:26:05.126
Whoa, what?

468
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:06.630
Yeah.

469
00:26:06.713 --> 00:26:08.132
Who would do that?

470
00:26:08.216 --> 00:26:09.301
Who do you think, huh?

471
00:26:09.385 --> 00:26:11.138
Your husband back at the diner.

472
00:26:11.222 --> 00:26:12.767
Wait, wait, man buns?

473
00:26:13.268 --> 00:26:14.061
Man buns.

474
00:26:16.608 --> 00:26:20.825
I mean, I can't
believe they did this.

475
00:26:20.908 --> 00:26:23.664
Is there a gas
station around here?

476
00:26:23.747 --> 00:26:25.835
Uh, yeah, yeah, there might be.

477
00:26:25.918 --> 00:26:27.672
Laura and I are
actually going to go get

478
00:26:27.755 --> 00:26:28.674
some gas, so we can actually--

479
00:26:28.757 --> 00:26:29.341
No.

480
00:26:29.425 --> 00:26:29.843
No.

481
00:26:29.926 --> 00:26:31.555
OK, guys.

482
00:26:31.638 --> 00:26:33.684
Spoonful of sugar will help the
medicine go down, all right?

483
00:26:33.767 --> 00:26:34.853
Speaking of going down.

484
00:26:34.936 --> 00:26:35.521
OK, go.

485
00:26:35.605 --> 00:26:36.230
We gotta.

486
00:26:36.314 --> 00:26:36.690
Bye, bye, bye.

487
00:26:36.773 --> 00:26:37.232
Bye.

488
00:26:37.316 --> 00:26:37.692
Bye.

489
00:26:37.775 --> 00:26:38.443
See ya.

490
00:26:56.647 --> 00:26:58.567
Are you seriously going
to leave me with him?

491
00:26:58.651 --> 00:27:00.571
Well, look, Amy, come
on, I've lived with him

492
00:27:00.655 --> 00:27:01.740
almost my whole life.

493
00:27:01.823 --> 00:27:05.246
I think you can
survive a few minutes.

494
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:06.917
How long is going to
take you to get back?

495
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:07.752
Not long.

496
00:27:07.835 --> 00:27:08.921
Trust me.

497
00:27:09.004 --> 00:27:10.423
Once we got there,
I promise you,

498
00:27:10.508 --> 00:27:12.469
you never have to talk
to him ever again.

499
00:27:12.553 --> 00:27:16.603
I'm sorry.

500
00:27:16.687 --> 00:27:17.605
I know he's your brother.

501
00:27:17.689 --> 00:27:18.481
I just--

502
00:27:18.565 --> 00:27:19.441
No, I totally get it.

503
00:27:19.526 --> 00:27:20.945
He's just like our dad.

504
00:27:21.028 --> 00:27:21.947
Great.

505
00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:23.784
So it runs in the family.

506
00:27:23.867 --> 00:27:25.663
How'd you turn out all right?

507
00:27:25.746 --> 00:27:27.792
I just ignore it,
and then I trust

508
00:27:27.875 --> 00:27:30.296
that most people mean well.

509
00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.469
That's the problem--
for me, anyway.

510
00:27:33.554 --> 00:27:35.473
How do you just
trust people blindly?

511
00:27:35.558 --> 00:27:36.643
No, not blindly.

512
00:27:36.727 --> 00:27:39.649
I just-- I talk to
people, you know?

513
00:27:39.733 --> 00:27:43.489
I get to know them,
and then I trust them.

514
00:27:43.574 --> 00:27:50.003
That was
surprisingly brilliant, Laura.

515
00:27:50.086 --> 00:27:52.340
You're breaking character.

516
00:27:52.424 --> 00:27:56.348
OK, well, maybe if you start
trusting people and knowing

517
00:27:56.432 --> 00:27:57.935
them, maybe you'll
actually get laid?

518
00:28:01.484 --> 00:28:01.943
Sorry.

519
00:28:05.116 --> 00:28:07.370
No, it's OK.

520
00:28:07.454 --> 00:28:09.374
Just hurry back.

521
00:28:09.458 --> 00:28:10.043
Yeah.

522
00:28:10.126 --> 00:28:10.878
It's all good.

523
00:28:10.961 --> 00:28:11.630
Let's go see them.

524
00:28:32.839 --> 00:28:33.507
Hello.

525
00:28:37.013 --> 00:28:38.099
Hey.

526
00:28:38.182 --> 00:28:41.438
Oh, jeez, the reception
is bad out here.

527
00:28:41.523 --> 00:28:42.942
Yeah.

528
00:28:43.025 --> 00:28:44.612
But it shouldn't be too far,
just a couple of kilometers

529
00:28:44.696 --> 00:28:47.450
down the road.

530
00:28:47.535 --> 00:28:49.956
How far do you think we'll
get before someone checks

531
00:28:50.039 --> 00:28:52.127
to see if you're getting
taken against your will?

532
00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:53.630
Wow.

533
00:28:53.714 --> 00:28:54.966
Look, you drag my ass
into a horror movie,

534
00:28:55.049 --> 00:28:56.468
you know who's dying first, OK?

535
00:28:56.553 --> 00:28:58.055
No one says horror
movies in Canada.

536
00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:03.984
Jeez, how many fucking
animals are out here anyways?

537
00:29:04.067 --> 00:29:05.988
It's farm country.

538
00:29:06.071 --> 00:29:07.032
Why?

539
00:29:07.115 --> 00:29:08.492
Afraid you'll be eaten alive?

540
00:29:08.577 --> 00:29:09.829
A-ha-ha-ha.

541
00:29:09.913 --> 00:29:14.714
No, but the cows will
have a field day, huh?

542
00:29:14.797 --> 00:29:15.173
Oh.

543
00:29:15.256 --> 00:29:15.841
Right?

544
00:29:15.925 --> 00:29:16.175
No.

545
00:29:16.258 --> 00:29:16.843
Yeah.

546
00:29:16.927 --> 00:29:17.511
Yeah.

547
00:29:17.595 --> 00:29:18.054
God.

548
00:29:18.137 --> 00:29:19.014
OK, no more puns.

549
00:29:19.097 --> 00:29:19.682
All right.

550
00:29:19.766 --> 00:29:20.684
I mean it.

551
00:29:20.768 --> 00:29:22.187
All right, all right, Jesus.

552
00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:24.525
One more and you are sucking
your own dick this weekend.

553
00:29:24.609 --> 00:29:26.863
All right, I'll save
it for later then.

554
00:29:37.677 --> 00:29:40.557
We're too late for them.

555
00:29:40.641 --> 00:29:41.183
Let's get to work.

556
00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:47.571
OK, you know what?

557
00:29:47.655 --> 00:29:48.907
Wait.

558
00:29:48.991 --> 00:29:51.078
The cabin is only, what,
five kilometers away?

559
00:29:51.161 --> 00:29:52.915
Why don't we just
go out and walk it?

560
00:29:52.999 --> 00:29:55.086
Yeah, only five kilometers,
huh, on a rural road

561
00:29:55.169 --> 00:29:56.255
in the middle of winter?

562
00:29:56.338 --> 00:29:57.925
The fuck is wrong with you, man?

563
00:29:58.009 --> 00:29:58.927
I'm just saying.

564
00:29:59.011 --> 00:30:00.263
Hey, guys.

565
00:30:00.346 --> 00:30:02.935
Do either one of
you have a signal?

566
00:30:03.019 --> 00:30:04.939
Because I don't.

567
00:30:05.023 --> 00:30:05.941
And with the wind.

568
00:30:06.025 --> 00:30:06.943
I don't know if that matters.

569
00:30:07.027 --> 00:30:08.613
No, fuck!

570
00:30:08.697 --> 00:30:09.782
So what do we do now, huh?

571
00:30:09.866 --> 00:30:10.617
OK, relax, OK?

572
00:30:10.701 --> 00:30:11.619
We can figure this out.

573
00:30:11.703 --> 00:30:12.621
We're investment bankers.

574
00:30:12.705 --> 00:30:14.625
Oh, yeah, relax, he says, huh?

575
00:30:14.709 --> 00:30:18.007
I'm in a broken down car in the
middle of butt fuck nowhere.

576
00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:20.178
But at least I got my
two best friends, huh?

577
00:30:20.261 --> 00:30:22.975
So everything's going
to be just fine.

578
00:30:23.059 --> 00:30:25.313
One best friend.

579
00:30:25.396 --> 00:30:27.818
Yeah, you don't like me.

580
00:30:27.902 --> 00:30:29.154
Yeah.

581
00:30:29.237 --> 00:30:30.657
Yeah, there's somebody
else I don't like either.

582
00:30:30.741 --> 00:30:32.160
And if I ever see
Man Buns again,

583
00:30:32.243 --> 00:30:33.705
I'm going to fucking
strangle him.

584
00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:35.166
I swear to God, I'll kill him.

585
00:30:35.249 --> 00:30:36.878
You don't even know
if he did it or not.

586
00:30:36.961 --> 00:30:38.339
Yes, I do.

587
00:30:38.422 --> 00:30:40.009
Another thing, I thought I
told you shut the fuck up.

588
00:30:40.093 --> 00:30:40.969
You know what, Samuel?

589
00:30:43.767 --> 00:30:44.894
Go F yourself.

590
00:30:44.977 --> 00:30:46.230
Oh, wow, huh?

591
00:30:46.313 --> 00:30:47.691
Look who just arrived.

592
00:30:47.775 --> 00:30:48.735
Yeah, upset Mitch.

593
00:30:48.819 --> 00:30:49.737
Yeah?

594
00:30:49.821 --> 00:30:50.697
This is upset Mitch time.

595
00:30:50.781 --> 00:30:51.198
He's back.

596
00:30:51.281 --> 00:30:52.200
Stop.

597
00:30:52.283 --> 00:30:54.705
Shut the-- shut the fuck up!

598
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:55.707
You know what?

599
00:30:55.791 --> 00:30:56.751
I'm going to go take a piss.

600
00:30:56.835 --> 00:30:57.377
Sorry.

601
00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:58.379
Take a pee.

602
00:30:58.462 --> 00:31:00.216
Is that OK with upset Mitch?

603
00:31:00.299 --> 00:31:01.886
Fuck.

604
00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:06.061
A bunch of hoity-toity
motherfucking pieces of shit.

605
00:31:06.145 --> 00:31:08.107
I swear to God, Mitch.

606
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:08.984
One more word.

607
00:31:11.488 --> 00:31:14.244
And you'll feel the
wrath of upset Mitch.

608
00:31:14.327 --> 00:31:16.916
Yeah, the wrath of upset Mitch.

609
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:17.417
You'll be sorry.

610
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.799
Yeah, sure, sorry.

611
00:31:20.883 --> 00:31:21.383
Upset Mitch.

612
00:32:18.999 --> 00:32:22.046
Ah, I'm sorry, Pastor Kurt.

613
00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:25.554
No apologies, Mr. Lange, but,
please, stop calling me pastor.

614
00:32:25.637 --> 00:32:26.471
I don't deserve it.

615
00:32:29.311 --> 00:32:33.570
Back when I was a minister,
I suffered a terrible crisis

616
00:32:33.653 --> 00:32:36.074
of faith.

617
00:32:36.158 --> 00:32:37.911
Do you remember Mr. Koch?

618
00:32:37.995 --> 00:32:41.084
Oh, Mr. Koch.

619
00:32:41.168 --> 00:32:43.255
A quiet man who used to
sit at the back of church

620
00:32:43.339 --> 00:32:45.426
during service.

621
00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:48.600
I had a breakdown while
delivering a sermon.

622
00:32:48.683 --> 00:32:52.273
And he came to visit
me a few days later.

623
00:32:52.357 --> 00:32:54.152
He wasn't much for
talk, but he was there

624
00:32:54.235 --> 00:32:57.283
when I needed it the most.

625
00:32:57.367 --> 00:32:59.496
I confided in the old man.

626
00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:03.630
He was a wonderful kindred soul.

627
00:33:03.713 --> 00:33:06.636
He warned me that it was
dangerous for a holy man

628
00:33:06.719 --> 00:33:10.476
to turn his back on his
faith, that it could make

629
00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.729
him a target for dark forces.

630
00:33:14.568 --> 00:33:19.494
He was the one that told me
tales of old German folklore

631
00:33:19.578 --> 00:33:21.999
about the wild hunt.

632
00:33:22.083 --> 00:33:26.341
If a transgressor finds himself
alone on a highway at night,

633
00:33:26.425 --> 00:33:29.682
he could become a victim
of a ghost hunt carried out

634
00:33:29.765 --> 00:33:31.686
by demons and their hounds.

635
00:33:31.769 --> 00:33:36.529
Deep down, I believe
that my crisis of faith

636
00:33:36.612 --> 00:33:40.369
allowed for such a hound,
an ancient being known

637
00:33:40.453 --> 00:33:48.720
as a to
enter this world, which

638
00:33:48.803 --> 00:33:52.686
is why it's imperative that I
be the one that sends him back.

639
00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.535
You want to play a
game to past the time?

640
00:34:04.167 --> 00:34:04.752
Sure.

641
00:34:04.835 --> 00:34:07.089
Great.

642
00:34:07.173 --> 00:34:08.342
Let's play 20 questions.

643
00:34:10.847 --> 00:34:12.350
I'm thinking of a person.

644
00:34:15.397 --> 00:34:16.609
Is it a man?

645
00:34:16.692 --> 00:34:18.780
Yes.

646
00:34:18.863 --> 00:34:20.116
Under 35?

647
00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:21.284
Yeah.

648
00:34:21.368 --> 00:34:22.286
Famous?

649
00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:24.667
No.

650
00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:28.173
Do we both know this
person personally?

651
00:34:28.257 --> 00:34:30.637
Yes.

652
00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.308
Is it you?

653
00:34:33.392 --> 00:34:33.726
Bingo!

654
00:34:36.899 --> 00:34:38.695
Where do you think he
went, huh, Niagara Falls?

655
00:34:38.778 --> 00:34:39.738
Jesus Christ.

656
00:34:44.748 --> 00:34:45.416
What's that?

657
00:34:47.086 --> 00:34:48.255
What is that?

658
00:34:54.434 --> 00:34:55.352
Oh my god!

659
00:34:55.436 --> 00:34:56.438
Sean!

660
00:34:59.444 --> 00:35:00.362
Sean!

661
00:35:00.446 --> 00:35:01.699
Sean!

662
00:35:01.782 --> 00:35:02.366
Sean.

663
00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:02.868
Sean.

664
00:35:02.951 --> 00:35:03.703
Sean.

665
00:35:06.458 --> 00:35:07.376
Sean.

666
00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:08.880
You're going to be OK.

667
00:35:08.963 --> 00:35:09.965
You're going to be OK.

668
00:35:30.882 --> 00:35:31.466
Hey.

669
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:32.259
Oh!

670
00:35:32.343 --> 00:35:33.261
Sorry, sorry.

671
00:35:33.345 --> 00:35:34.765
I didn't mean to startle you.

672
00:35:34.848 --> 00:35:36.936
We were just wondering, is
there like a gas station

673
00:35:37.019 --> 00:35:39.775
near here or something?

674
00:35:39.858 --> 00:35:42.446
Probably not this late.

675
00:35:42.531 --> 00:35:43.448
You know what?

676
00:35:43.533 --> 00:35:44.283
I got some gas you could have.

677
00:35:44.367 --> 00:35:45.285
Yeah?

678
00:35:45.369 --> 00:35:46.287
But don't tell the wife, please.

679
00:35:46.371 --> 00:35:47.456
Oh, no, perish the thought.

680
00:35:47.541 --> 00:35:48.041
Thank you.

681
00:35:53.385 --> 00:35:53.970
There you go.

682
00:35:54.053 --> 00:35:56.474
Thanks.

683
00:35:56.559 --> 00:35:59.815
So, did you guys meet on
the computer or something?

684
00:35:59.898 --> 00:36:04.490
No, no, no, we--

685
00:36:04.575 --> 00:36:05.492
med school.

686
00:36:05.577 --> 00:36:06.369
Med school?

687
00:36:06.453 --> 00:36:06.912
Yep.

688
00:36:09.585 --> 00:36:11.547
OK, well, I'll be inside.

689
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:13.509
If you guys want to
warm up, help yourself.

690
00:36:13.593 --> 00:36:14.845
And if you need
anything, give a knock.

691
00:36:14.928 --> 00:36:15.847
Thanks.

692
00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:16.515
Thank you for the gas.

693
00:36:46.157 --> 00:36:47.409
Let's go.

694
00:36:47.493 --> 00:36:48.746
Wait, do we have
to go this minute?

695
00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:49.581
Yeah.

696
00:36:49.665 --> 00:36:50.082
Yeah, they're waiting.

697
00:36:50.165 --> 00:36:50.625
Why?

698
00:36:50.708 --> 00:36:51.752
Why?

699
00:36:51.836 --> 00:36:52.419
Look at that shed over there.

700
00:36:52.504 --> 00:36:53.421
Maybe.

701
00:36:53.506 --> 00:36:53.923
OK.

702
00:36:54.006 --> 00:36:55.593
Yeah.

703
00:36:55.677 --> 00:36:56.595
Oh, no, no, no.

704
00:36:56.679 --> 00:36:57.931
No, we're not doing that in--

705
00:36:58.014 --> 00:36:59.433
Why not?

706
00:36:59.518 --> 00:37:00.477
No, we're not doing that
on Big Bubba's property.

707
00:37:00.562 --> 00:37:01.981
No way, no.

708
00:37:02.064 --> 00:37:04.611
OK, look, the way things are
going between Amy and Tim,

709
00:37:04.695 --> 00:37:06.615
I'm going to be babysitting
Amy all weekend.

710
00:37:06.699 --> 00:37:09.621
You're going to be
talking sports with Tim.

711
00:37:11.207 --> 00:37:15.633
And we're not going to have
any time, just you and I. OK?

712
00:37:15.717 --> 00:37:16.844
What do you think?

713
00:37:16.927 --> 00:37:17.554
Yeah.

714
00:37:20.225 --> 00:37:21.019
All right?

715
00:37:23.064 --> 00:37:23.983
Yeah, let's go.

716
00:37:24.066 --> 00:37:24.610
Come on.

717
00:37:27.574 --> 00:37:29.828
How far is this
damn gas station?

718
00:37:29.912 --> 00:37:30.580
I don't know.

719
00:37:39.932 --> 00:37:42.186
What was Laura like as a kid?

720
00:37:42.269 --> 00:37:44.858
Did she ever tell you
about comic books?

721
00:37:44.942 --> 00:37:46.528
Comic books?

722
00:37:46.612 --> 00:37:48.741
Yeah.

723
00:37:48.824 --> 00:37:51.580
That's all she'd ever read.

724
00:37:51.664 --> 00:37:54.920
Her favorite was
that..

725
00:37:55.003 --> 00:37:56.882
No way.

726
00:37:56.966 --> 00:38:00.723
Yeah, she would read that and
try to pick fights with me.

727
00:38:00.807 --> 00:38:02.811
I would kick her ass.

728
00:38:06.819 --> 00:38:09.741
You'd beat up your
little sister?

729
00:38:09.825 --> 00:38:11.912
Well, we were kids.

730
00:38:11.996 --> 00:38:13.916
I still could, though.

731
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.085
Cool.

732
00:38:15.168 --> 00:38:16.630
I definitely still
could, you know.

733
00:38:16.714 --> 00:38:17.841
No, we're done now.

734
00:38:23.018 --> 00:38:24.186
Do you have siblings?

735
00:38:28.028 --> 00:38:30.157
I have a younger
sister and brother.

736
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.994
You're the oldest, too?

737
00:38:32.077 --> 00:38:34.791
Yeah.

738
00:38:34.875 --> 00:38:36.628
It's the worst.

739
00:38:36.712 --> 00:38:40.970
I had to teach Laura
what not to do a lot.

740
00:38:41.054 --> 00:38:42.640
My siblings don't really get me.

741
00:38:42.724 --> 00:38:47.024
Well, do you guys ever hang out?

742
00:38:47.107 --> 00:38:49.821
Not really.

743
00:38:49.905 --> 00:38:51.700
I'm not that close
with my sister.

744
00:38:51.784 --> 00:38:53.411
My brother is six
years younger than me.

745
00:38:56.919 --> 00:38:58.881
I think they just
think I'm weird.

746
00:38:58.964 --> 00:39:00.217
Probably.

747
00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.012
But I mean, if you
were never hanging out

748
00:39:02.096 --> 00:39:04.183
with them and never
talk, how are they

749
00:39:04.266 --> 00:39:05.937
expected to think differently?

750
00:39:10.445 --> 00:39:12.867
You have a point.

751
00:39:12.951 --> 00:39:19.881
I mean, Laura and I, we fight
a lot, but we're super close.

752
00:39:19.965 --> 00:39:22.219
I kind of wish I had that.

753
00:39:22.302 --> 00:39:23.304
You still can.

754
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:31.112
Thanks.

755
00:39:31.195 --> 00:39:31.822
No problem.

756
00:39:39.504 --> 00:39:44.931
Saint Michael, the Archangel,
defend us in battle.

757
00:39:45.015 --> 00:39:46.434
Be our protection
against the wickedness

758
00:39:46.518 --> 00:39:49.941
and the snares of the devil.

759
00:39:50.025 --> 00:39:53.198
May God rebuke him,
we humbly pray.

760
00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:06.140
Oh, do thou, oh, prince
of the Heavenly Host,

761
00:40:06.224 --> 00:40:11.484
by the power of god
cast into hell, Satan...

762
00:40:11.568 --> 00:40:16.327
and all the evil spirits that
prowl throughout the world,

763
00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:18.456
seeking the ruin of souls.

764
00:40:21.087 --> 00:40:21.505
Stop.

765
00:40:22.256 --> 00:40:23.174
Renfield!

766
00:40:23.258 --> 00:40:23.926
Renfield!

767
00:40:29.938 --> 00:40:31.858
Amen.

768
00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:57.409
Whew!

769
00:40:57.492 --> 00:40:58.411
Whew!

770
00:40:58.494 --> 00:41:00.916
Whew!

771
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.087
Sam!

772
00:41:03.171 --> 00:41:03.922
Anybody?

773
00:41:04.006 --> 00:41:04.465
Let me in!

774
00:41:04.549 --> 00:41:05.091
Please, please!

775
00:41:05.175 --> 00:41:05.593
Mitch?

776
00:41:05.676 --> 00:41:06.595
Seriously!

777
00:41:06.678 --> 00:41:07.429
Mitch, you're still alive?

778
00:41:07.513 --> 00:41:08.264
Sam!

779
00:41:08.348 --> 00:41:08.599
Yes, please.

780
00:41:08.682 --> 00:41:09.308
I am.

781
00:41:09.391 --> 00:41:10.101
Let me in.

782
00:41:10.185 --> 00:41:10.435
Let me in.

783
00:41:10.519 --> 00:41:11.270
No!

784
00:41:11.354 --> 00:41:12.272
No, sorry, buddy.

785
00:41:12.356 --> 00:41:13.441
I can't do it.

786
00:41:13.525 --> 00:41:14.443
I can't do it.

787
00:41:14.527 --> 00:41:15.111
I can't let you in right now.

788
00:41:15.195 --> 00:41:15.947
No!

789
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.447
What, are you kidding?

790
00:41:16.531 --> 00:41:17.282
Let me in!

791
00:41:17.366 --> 00:41:17.950
I'm not, man!

792
00:41:18.034 --> 00:41:18.619
I'm sorry!

793
00:41:18.702 --> 00:41:20.121
I just can't do it.

794
00:41:20.205 --> 00:41:21.457
I don't know what the
fuck it is out there!

795
00:41:21.541 --> 00:41:22.960
It's not a shape shifter!

796
00:41:23.044 --> 00:41:24.171
It's me!

797
00:41:24.254 --> 00:41:25.508
Come on, let me in!

798
00:41:25.591 --> 00:41:26.467
I don't know what the
fuck a shape shifter is.

799
00:41:26.551 --> 00:41:27.469
Listen.

800
00:41:27.553 --> 00:41:29.516
I'm sorry, OK, Mitch?

801
00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:30.976
I'm too young.

802
00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:31.978
I haven't even
touched my trust fund.

803
00:41:32.062 --> 00:41:32.647
I'm sorry.

804
00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:33.481
OK?

805
00:41:33.565 --> 00:41:35.653
You cowardly pig ass!

806
00:41:35.736 --> 00:41:37.322
Well, now you're
definitely on your own.

807
00:41:37.406 --> 00:41:38.659
OK, I'm sorry!

808
00:41:38.742 --> 00:41:39.368
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

809
00:41:39.451 --> 00:41:40.203
Please, Sam.

810
00:41:40.286 --> 00:41:40.996
Samuel, let me in.

811
00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:41.497
Let me in.

812
00:41:41.581 --> 00:41:43.001
Let me in.

813
00:41:43.084 --> 00:41:46.508
Do you want it to get me?

814
00:41:46.591 --> 00:41:47.342
Fuck!

815
00:41:47.426 --> 00:41:48.512
Son of a bitch!

816
00:41:48.595 --> 00:41:49.346
Ha!

817
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:51.183
Fuck!

818
00:41:51.267 --> 00:42:00.368
You beat shit on the
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

819
00:42:00.452 --> 00:42:01.705
God damn it!

820
00:42:01.788 --> 00:42:02.330
Mitch!

821
00:42:09.136 --> 00:42:09.512
Bill.

822
00:42:13.478 --> 00:42:15.566
There's someone at the door.

823
00:42:15.649 --> 00:42:17.444
I know.

824
00:42:17.528 --> 00:42:19.406
I know.

825
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:21.160
So go answer it, you big galoot.

826
00:42:23.665 --> 00:42:25.418
God damn it, I'll answer
something for you.

827
00:42:25.502 --> 00:42:27.255
What?

828
00:42:27.339 --> 00:42:28.257
Yes, dear.

829
00:42:28.341 --> 00:42:29.384
That's what I thought you said.

830
00:42:35.188 --> 00:42:36.315
Oh, no.

831
00:42:36.398 --> 00:42:37.442
No, you got to be
fucking kidding me.

832
00:42:37.527 --> 00:42:38.194
Come here.

833
00:42:54.561 --> 00:42:55.813
Hey, guys.

834
00:42:55.896 --> 00:42:58.652
Guys?

835
00:42:58.735 --> 00:42:59.486
Guys?

836
00:43:02.743 --> 00:43:03.829
Guys?

837
00:43:03.912 --> 00:43:04.581
Guys?

838
00:43:07.587 --> 00:43:08.254
Whoa!

839
00:43:10.926 --> 00:43:11.678
Jesus Christ!

840
00:43:14.934 --> 00:43:16.353
Do you hear that?

841
00:43:16.437 --> 00:43:17.355
What?

842
00:43:17.439 --> 00:43:18.650
I don't hear anything, baby.

843
00:43:26.625 --> 00:43:27.292
Yeah, fuck it.

844
00:43:36.978 --> 00:43:37.354
Bill?

845
00:43:47.833 --> 00:43:48.501
Bill!

846
00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:08.709
Bill.

847
00:44:21.066 --> 00:44:21.609
Bill!

848
00:48:05.014 --> 00:48:08.437
When I left the ministry
for a new mission,

849
00:48:08.521 --> 00:48:12.779
you sought me out and readily
offered your services.

850
00:48:12.863 --> 00:48:14.909
I'm curious as to
what drives you.

851
00:48:17.539 --> 00:48:18.750
You remember my wife Clara.

852
00:48:21.547 --> 00:48:23.300
Of course you do.

853
00:48:23.383 --> 00:48:26.306
He married us.

854
00:48:26.389 --> 00:48:30.899
Clara, Clara took sick.

855
00:48:34.113 --> 00:48:36.493
We had bought a new home.

856
00:48:36.577 --> 00:48:41.211
It was a foreclosure, so it was
the only thing we could afford.

857
00:48:41.294 --> 00:48:44.175
I still remember the first
day we walked in there.

858
00:48:44.259 --> 00:48:48.518
I felt like we'd lived
there our whole lives.

859
00:48:48.601 --> 00:48:50.522
It felt like home.

860
00:48:50.605 --> 00:48:53.068
A few weeks after
we'd settled in,

861
00:48:53.151 --> 00:48:55.364
Clara started having nightmares.

862
00:48:55.447 --> 00:48:57.076
Some nights, she
would wake up feeling

863
00:48:57.159 --> 00:48:59.372
like there was a person on
her chest, someone keeping her

864
00:48:59.455 --> 00:49:01.209
from moving.

865
00:49:01.293 --> 00:49:07.221
She heard whispers of somebody
called the Duke of Crows.

866
00:49:07.305 --> 00:49:11.564
I couldn't recall
exactly what was said.

867
00:49:11.647 --> 00:49:15.237
I told her they
were only dreams.

868
00:49:15.321 --> 00:49:18.243
One morning, Clara
woke up with scratches

869
00:49:18.327 --> 00:49:23.295
all over her, blood on
the sheets and her shirt.

870
00:49:23.378 --> 00:49:26.510
She kept going on about
the Duke of Crows.

871
00:49:31.353 --> 00:49:33.315
So you came to me.

872
00:49:33.398 --> 00:49:36.154
I always looked
up to you, Kurdt.

873
00:49:36.237 --> 00:49:38.450
But you had left
some time before

874
00:49:38.534 --> 00:49:40.037
and had, of course,
been replaced.

875
00:49:42.584 --> 00:49:45.005
I called the new
minister to our house.

876
00:49:45.089 --> 00:49:46.634
He told us there
was no such thing

877
00:49:46.717 --> 00:49:49.640
as demons that haunt houses.

878
00:49:49.723 --> 00:49:52.562
He thought that
make-believe.

879
00:49:55.568 --> 00:49:59.660
He thought she had done this
to herself in her sleep.

880
00:49:59.743 --> 00:50:02.582
He recommended a few prayers
and a good psychiatrist.

881
00:50:06.256 --> 00:50:08.009
But it kept happening.

882
00:50:08.093 --> 00:50:16.192
Then, that very night,
she was hysterical.

883
00:50:16.276 --> 00:50:20.200
She kept going on about the Duke
of Crows, the Duke of Crows,

884
00:50:20.284 --> 00:50:23.373
the Duke of Crows.

885
00:50:23.457 --> 00:50:26.714
I urged her to go back
to sleep, telling her

886
00:50:26.797 --> 00:50:30.387
we would leave the next morning.

887
00:50:30.471 --> 00:50:31.306
She fell asleep.

888
00:50:35.147 --> 00:50:37.151
I awoke later that
night to an empty bed.

889
00:50:41.493 --> 00:50:44.415
I went downstairs.

890
00:50:44.499 --> 00:50:46.336
I found Clara in the kitchen.

891
00:50:52.348 --> 00:51:03.621
She had-- she had cut crosses
on her wrists..

892
00:51:03.704 --> 00:51:04.623
She was--

893
00:51:13.724 --> 00:51:15.269
You don't know how
very sorry I am.

894
00:51:19.903 --> 00:51:21.239
That was two years ago now.

895
00:51:24.788 --> 00:51:26.291
I couldn't go back
to the church.

896
00:51:30.592 --> 00:51:32.679
But I remembered you.

897
00:51:32.762 --> 00:51:36.185
I remembered the sermons
you used to give.

898
00:51:36.269 --> 00:51:39.191
I heard your words in my mind.

899
00:51:39.275 --> 00:51:43.116
Whenever you spoke, I felt
like I'd found God again.

900
00:51:45.788 --> 00:51:50.297
I was so mad at him for
taking my Clara away from me.

901
00:51:52.636 --> 00:51:53.888
But I kept thinking
about that one

902
00:51:53.971 --> 00:51:58.564
Sunday when you spoke
about forgiveness.

903
00:51:58.648 --> 00:52:02.404
I don't know if you remember it.

904
00:52:02.488 --> 00:52:07.414
Let all bitterness and
wrath and anger and clamor

905
00:52:07.498 --> 00:52:11.339
and slander be put away from
you, including all malice.

906
00:52:14.721 --> 00:52:18.521
Forgive one another, as
God in Christ forgave you.

907
00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:23.363
I do remember.

908
00:52:26.369 --> 00:52:30.545
That was the day we spoke
and became good friends.

909
00:52:35.555 --> 00:52:36.932
I always wanted to
thank you for that.

910
00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:44.656
I have so much guilt
about what happened.

911
00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:50.585
Well, I've rediscovered
my purpose.

912
00:52:53.423 --> 00:52:54.760
Now her death won't be in vain.

913
00:52:59.101 --> 00:53:01.439
Let her sacrifice save
this world, Lange.

914
00:53:04.821 --> 00:53:07.034
To Clara.

915
00:53:07.117 --> 00:53:09.539
To Clara.

916
00:53:09.623 --> 00:53:10.833
May she rest in peace.

917
00:53:14.508 --> 00:53:16.553
Is there a blanket in
the back or something?

918
00:53:16.637 --> 00:53:18.389
No, but here.

919
00:53:18.473 --> 00:53:19.893
You take this.

920
00:53:19.976 --> 00:53:21.395
Whoa.

921
00:53:21.479 --> 00:53:22.899
You'll need that.

922
00:53:22.982 --> 00:53:23.734
Don't worry about me.

923
00:53:23.818 --> 00:53:24.986
I'm always warm.

924
00:53:30.665 --> 00:53:30.998
Thanks.

925
00:53:39.014 --> 00:53:40.183
Hope they're okay.

926
00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:43.649
Yeah, I'm sure they're fine.

927
00:53:43.732 --> 00:53:46.780
Are you any warmer?

928
00:53:46.864 --> 00:53:48.617
I'll get there.

929
00:53:48.701 --> 00:53:50.495
Well, here.

930
00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:51.122
Please.

931
00:53:51.205 --> 00:53:53.501
What?

932
00:53:53.586 --> 00:53:55.463
I don't like to be touched.

933
00:53:55.548 --> 00:53:59.471
Please, just don't touch me.

934
00:53:59.556 --> 00:54:00.975
Well, how about this?

935
00:54:01.058 --> 00:54:03.689
What the fuck?

936
00:54:03.772 --> 00:54:04.816
What are you doing?

937
00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:07.655
Making a move.

938
00:54:07.739 --> 00:54:08.489
What the fuck?

939
00:54:08.574 --> 00:54:10.661
Why?

940
00:54:10.745 --> 00:54:13.667
Do I really need to
explain how this works?

941
00:54:13.751 --> 00:54:16.548
I'm sorry if I gave you
some kind of impression,

942
00:54:16.632 --> 00:54:20.180
but it's not going to happen.

943
00:54:20.263 --> 00:54:21.015
I don't get it.

944
00:54:21.098 --> 00:54:23.019
Why did you come?

945
00:54:23.102 --> 00:54:26.150
Because Laura is my friend, and
she invited me to her cottage.

946
00:54:29.114 --> 00:54:31.202
Am I alone here?

947
00:54:31.285 --> 00:54:34.709
There has been nothing but
awkward tension between us.

948
00:54:34.793 --> 00:54:37.757
I can't imagine how you would
even think to make a move.

949
00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:41.556
I'm not exactly going for
great conversation here.

950
00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:43.727
You're disgusting.

951
00:54:43.811 --> 00:54:45.230
Coming
from a 23-year-old

952
00:54:45.313 --> 00:54:47.192
who hasn't grown out of
her high school phase.

953
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:51.576
Wow.

954
00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:54.081
You really can't accept
rejection, can you?

955
00:54:54.164 --> 00:54:55.918
There was no rejection.

956
00:54:56.002 --> 00:54:59.091
You were the only thing
around, so I went for it.

957
00:54:59.174 --> 00:55:00.594
Ow.

958
00:55:00.678 --> 00:55:05.604
Get the fuck-- get the
fuck out of my car.

959
00:55:05.688 --> 00:55:07.107
No, fuck you.

960
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:09.278
Just get the fuck out of my car.

961
00:55:11.198 --> 00:55:13.954
What was that?

962
00:55:14.038 --> 00:55:17.002
A rattlesnake?

963
00:55:17.085 --> 00:55:18.129
A fucking rattlesnake?

964
00:55:18.212 --> 00:55:18.839
Are you serious?

965
00:55:18.922 --> 00:55:20.133
I don't know.

966
00:55:20.216 --> 00:55:21.302
I've seen rattlesnakes
up here before.

967
00:55:21.385 --> 00:55:23.222
It's the middle
of fucking winter.

968
00:55:25.895 --> 00:55:28.316
OK, not a rattlesnake.

969
00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:51.696
Oh, my God.

970
00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:52.865
Oh, my God.

971
00:55:52.949 --> 00:55:54.076
Are you OK?

972
00:55:54.159 --> 00:55:56.205
It almost took my
fucking foot off!

973
00:55:56.288 --> 00:55:58.209
Is there anything in here
to help with the wound?

974
00:55:58.292 --> 00:56:00.380
In the back,
there's..

975
00:56:00.463 --> 00:56:01.382
OK.

976
00:56:03.344 --> 00:56:04.889
Manny!

977
00:56:04.973 --> 00:56:05.766
Manny!

978
00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:08.062
Are you OK?

979
00:56:08.146 --> 00:56:09.064
Where's Laura?

980
00:56:09.148 --> 00:56:09.899
Manny!

981
00:56:09.983 --> 00:56:11.068
Where's Laura?

982
00:56:11.152 --> 00:56:14.408
The fuck is Laura?

983
00:56:14.491 --> 00:56:16.746
She's gone.

984
00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:20.253
No, no, no.

985
00:56:20.336 --> 00:56:22.967
What do you mean, gone?

986
00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:23.760
I'm sorry.

987
00:56:23.844 --> 00:56:24.428
I can't--

988
00:56:24.512 --> 00:56:25.430
What happened to her, man?

989
00:56:25.514 --> 00:56:27.267
I couldn't save her.

990
00:56:27.350 --> 00:56:28.102
I'm sorry.

991
00:56:28.186 --> 00:56:29.772
I couldn't save her.

992
00:56:29.856 --> 00:56:31.108
Put this on, Manny.

993
00:56:31.192 --> 00:56:33.446
Put this on.

994
00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:36.953
I know it's horrible, but
you need to listen to me.

995
00:56:37.037 --> 00:56:38.122
Tim is hurt.

996
00:56:38.206 --> 00:56:39.792
You need to take a
look at his foot.

997
00:56:39.876 --> 00:56:43.800
Do you understand?

998
00:56:43.884 --> 00:56:45.345
OK, lay back.

999
00:56:45.428 --> 00:56:46.180
Tim.

1000
00:56:46.263 --> 00:56:46.973
Tim, lay back.

1001
00:56:52.902 --> 00:56:54.154
Shit.

1002
00:56:54.238 --> 00:56:55.156
OK, we gotta go.

1003
00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:56.826
OK.

1004
00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:57.828
I'm not going anywhere.

1005
00:56:57.912 --> 00:56:58.496
It's not safe here.

1006
00:56:58.580 --> 00:56:59.414
The glass is broken!

1007
00:57:15.446 --> 00:57:16.448
Take his arm.

1008
00:57:47.177 --> 00:57:48.179
Is the close?

1009
00:57:51.686 --> 00:57:54.274
Yes, he is.

1010
00:57:54.358 --> 00:57:57.447
Check the table alignment.

1011
00:57:57.531 --> 00:57:59.284
Is everything set?

1012
00:57:59.368 --> 00:58:00.036
It is.

1013
00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:09.471
There's only one thing
missing, my friend.

1014
00:58:09.555 --> 00:58:11.475
What?

1015
00:58:19.575 --> 00:58:23.332
The blood sacrifice.

1016
00:58:57.317 --> 00:58:59.321
OK, come here.

1017
00:59:07.170 --> 00:59:07.588
Prop him up.

1018
00:59:07.671 --> 00:59:08.380
Prop him up.

1019
00:59:14.519 --> 00:59:15.269
Easy, easy, easy.

1020
00:59:15.353 --> 00:59:17.440
Breathe.

1021
00:59:17.525 --> 00:59:18.359
Do you have a light?

1022
00:59:22.242 --> 00:59:23.620
Oh, my God.

1023
00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:29.632
Yeah.

1024
00:59:29.715 --> 00:59:30.383
Yeah.

1025
00:59:34.224 --> 00:59:40.361
So how did you get into singing
or screaming or whatever?

1026
00:59:40.444 --> 00:59:41.321
Are you serious?

1027
00:59:41.405 --> 00:59:43.660
Yes, yes, I'm serious.

1028
00:59:43.743 --> 00:59:46.164
I don't want to think about
what just happened back there,

1029
00:59:46.248 --> 00:59:48.502
so give me something, anything.

1030
00:59:48.587 --> 00:59:50.172
OK.

1031
00:59:50.256 --> 00:59:52.176
I just, I do music sometimes.

1032
00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:54.306
It's not all that
I do or anything.

1033
00:59:58.773 --> 01:00:00.861
I also work at a tattoo shop.

1034
01:00:00.944 --> 01:00:03.240
I just, I went in
with my portfolio.

1035
01:00:03.324 --> 01:00:06.706
And the girl who owns
the shop just hired me.

1036
01:00:09.962 --> 01:00:14.555
Yeah, I eventually want to
open my own tattoo shop.

1037
01:00:14.639 --> 01:00:15.724
That's good.

1038
01:00:15.807 --> 01:00:18.730
Not a lot of people
know their path.

1039
01:00:18.813 --> 01:00:22.278
Did you always want
to be a doctor?

1040
01:00:22.362 --> 01:00:26.913
No, I wanted to be a
professional free runner.

1041
01:00:26.996 --> 01:00:29.250
Is that a real thing?

1042
01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:31.463
As real as a professional
skateboarder.

1043
01:00:31.547 --> 01:00:32.591
My dad's a lawyer.

1044
01:00:32.675 --> 01:00:33.927
Definitely didn't
want to do that.

1045
01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:38.770
So I decided doctor.

1046
01:00:38.853 --> 01:00:42.276
What kind of doctor
do you want to be?

1047
01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:45.449
Gynecologist.

1048
01:00:45.534 --> 01:00:46.619
Ugh.

1049
01:00:46.703 --> 01:00:48.957
Are you going to
punch him in the face?

1050
01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:49.709
Got it.

1051
01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:57.306
All right.

1052
01:00:57.390 --> 01:00:58.392
Got him all patched up.

1053
01:01:02.066 --> 01:01:04.487
What the fuck do we do now?

1054
01:01:04.572 --> 01:01:07.326
I don't know.

1055
01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:10.499
Should check the shed,
see what we can use.

1056
01:01:10.584 --> 01:01:10.917
OK.

1057
01:01:21.939 --> 01:01:24.862
You mean like matches or
a lighter or something?

1058
01:01:24.945 --> 01:01:25.822
Yeah, anything works.

1059
01:01:28.787 --> 01:01:29.872
Tim, you find anything?

1060
01:01:29.955 --> 01:01:30.624
Uh-huh.

1061
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:33.963
Yeah.

1062
01:02:06.696 --> 01:02:07.196
Oh, god.

1063
01:02:19.889 --> 01:02:20.807
Shit!

1064
01:02:20.891 --> 01:02:21.433
Jesus!

1065
01:02:25.734 --> 01:02:26.234
Ah!

1066
01:02:29.115 --> 01:02:30.492
You're from the diner!

1067
01:02:30.577 --> 01:02:30.994
Shit!

1068
01:02:31.077 --> 01:02:32.038
I'm so sorry.

1069
01:02:32.121 --> 01:02:32.831
I thought it was the other way.

1070
01:02:32.915 --> 01:02:33.666
Hey, look at me.

1071
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:34.543
Look at me.

1072
01:02:34.627 --> 01:02:35.002
Look at me.

1073
01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:35.837
Ugh.

1074
01:02:35.921 --> 01:02:36.672
Oh, shoot.

1075
01:02:36.756 --> 01:02:37.841
OK.

1076
01:02:37.925 --> 01:02:38.676
He's having an
allergic reaction.

1077
01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:39.177
We have to get moving.

1078
01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:39.678
Ugh.

1079
01:02:39.762 --> 01:02:40.513
Hey.

1080
01:02:40.597 --> 01:02:41.515
Look at me.

1081
01:02:41.599 --> 01:02:42.016
Wait, where did you come from?

1082
01:02:42.099 --> 01:02:43.728
In the garden.

1083
01:02:43.811 --> 01:02:44.688
OK.

1084
01:02:44.772 --> 01:02:45.523
All right, whatever.

1085
01:02:45.607 --> 01:02:47.694
Come on, let's go.

1086
01:03:14.330 --> 01:03:14.915
Hey.

1087
01:03:15.834 --> 01:03:16.919
Hey, open up.

1088
01:03:17.003 --> 01:03:19.591
I have someone who
needs medical attention.

1089
01:03:19.675 --> 01:03:20.927
Mitch?

1090
01:03:21.011 --> 01:03:22.263
Oh, fuck you!

1091
01:03:22.346 --> 01:03:23.098
Huh?

1092
01:03:23.181 --> 01:03:24.601
Hey, open the door.

1093
01:03:24.685 --> 01:03:25.102
Your buddy's having
an allergic reaction.

1094
01:03:25.185 --> 01:03:25.770
No way.

1095
01:03:25.854 --> 01:03:27.106
Fuck you.

1096
01:03:27.189 --> 01:03:27.774
That thing could have
fucking followed you.

1097
01:03:27.858 --> 01:03:28.609
Fuck you.

1098
01:03:28.693 --> 01:03:29.611
Open the door.

1099
01:03:29.695 --> 01:03:30.279
We're far enough away from it.

1100
01:03:30.362 --> 01:03:31.281
Open the fucking door.

1101
01:03:31.364 --> 01:03:32.993
No, you're a fucking liar!

1102
01:03:33.076 --> 01:03:35.122
Come on.

1103
01:03:35.205 --> 01:03:36.792
Get the door closed!

1104
01:03:36.876 --> 01:03:37.627
Jesus!

1105
01:03:37.711 --> 01:03:38.629
Come on.

1106
01:03:38.713 --> 01:03:39.965
Come on, come on, come on.

1107
01:03:51.071 --> 01:03:51.655
OK.

1108
01:03:51.739 --> 01:03:53.826
All right.

1109
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:54.243
Hey.

1110
01:03:57.124 --> 01:04:00.339
Amy, Amy, Amy, get
some duct tape.

1111
01:04:00.422 --> 01:04:02.093
Over there, get duct
tape over there.

1112
01:04:06.267 --> 01:04:07.103
Mitch, are you OK?

1113
01:04:13.115 --> 01:04:14.283
And I need a light.

1114
01:04:19.293 --> 01:04:20.212
OK.

1115
01:04:23.845 --> 01:04:25.723
You OK?

1116
01:04:25.807 --> 01:04:28.228
Hey, hey, hey,
relax, relax, relax.

1117
01:04:28.311 --> 01:04:29.063
Listen.

1118
01:04:29.147 --> 01:04:29.940
Listen, Mitch.

1119
01:04:30.023 --> 01:04:31.401
I need you to relax.

1120
01:04:31.484 --> 01:04:33.405
Manny, have you
done this before?

1121
01:04:33.488 --> 01:04:36.244
Yeah, once.

1122
01:04:36.327 --> 01:04:38.248
And my professor
was watching us.

1123
01:05:08.225 --> 01:05:09.978
All right.

1124
01:05:10.062 --> 01:05:11.815
We need to think.

1125
01:05:11.899 --> 01:05:13.819
How the hell are we going
to find a place that's

1126
01:05:13.903 --> 01:05:15.155
safe from this thing?

1127
01:05:15.239 --> 01:05:16.324
Yeah, that's a great point.

1128
01:05:16.407 --> 01:05:17.994
Yeah, I suggested
staying here before you

1129
01:05:18.078 --> 01:05:20.332
two burst in here with Mitch.

1130
01:05:20.415 --> 01:05:23.506
How do we even know
we're safe here?

1131
01:05:23.589 --> 01:05:25.008
We have to find that farmhouse.

1132
01:05:25.092 --> 01:05:25.885
It's close by.

1133
01:05:25.969 --> 01:05:26.887
Maybe they have a phone.

1134
01:05:26.971 --> 01:05:28.014
Phone's out.

1135
01:05:28.098 --> 01:05:29.016
Are you positive?

1136
01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:31.020
Phone is out.

1137
01:05:31.104 --> 01:05:33.526
OK, so then we stay here.

1138
01:05:33.609 --> 01:05:35.362
I don't know if that
going to leave us alone.

1139
01:05:35.445 --> 01:05:37.074
I also don't know
how long people

1140
01:05:37.157 --> 01:05:39.871
are going to take before they
come looking for us, too.

1141
01:05:39.955 --> 01:05:41.207
Fuck.

1142
01:05:41.291 --> 01:05:44.046
OK, we can't think about
that right now, OK?

1143
01:05:44.130 --> 01:05:47.386
Is Mitch going to be all right?

1144
01:05:47.469 --> 01:05:48.556
I don't know.

1145
01:05:48.639 --> 01:05:49.558
Yo, Mitch.

1146
01:05:49.641 --> 01:05:50.392
Mitch.

1147
01:05:50.475 --> 01:05:51.311
Hey, you all right?

1148
01:05:56.195 --> 01:05:57.406
It's over here.

1149
01:05:57.489 --> 01:05:58.909
Oh, my God.

1150
01:06:00.203 --> 01:06:01.582
Look out!

1151
01:06:01.665 --> 01:06:03.084
Oh, fuck me.

1152
01:06:37.236 --> 01:06:40.158
Don't touch me!

1153
01:06:40.242 --> 01:06:41.662
Are you all right?

1154
01:06:41.745 --> 01:06:42.413
Yes.

1155
01:06:45.419 --> 01:06:46.254
I'm fine.

1156
01:06:49.135 --> 01:06:50.345
Who are you?

1157
01:06:50.429 --> 01:06:52.015
I'm here to protect you.

1158
01:06:52.099 --> 01:06:52.684
Oh, thank God.

1159
01:06:52.767 --> 01:06:53.686
Are you with the police?

1160
01:06:53.769 --> 01:06:55.397
No.

1161
01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:56.357
So then who are you?

1162
01:06:56.441 --> 01:06:57.569
Who do you work for?

1163
01:06:57.652 --> 01:06:59.531
Amy, you need to come
with me to be safe.

1164
01:06:59.614 --> 01:07:00.533
How do you know my name?

1165
01:07:00.616 --> 01:07:02.077
How do you know her name?

1166
01:07:02.161 --> 01:07:03.371
We need to leave.

1167
01:07:03.455 --> 01:07:04.373
No, no, no, how do
you know her name?

1168
01:07:04.457 --> 01:07:06.210
Who do you work for?

1169
01:07:06.294 --> 01:07:07.547
Guys, come on.

1170
01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:08.549
No.

1171
01:07:08.632 --> 01:07:10.385
Did you know about this?

1172
01:07:10.469 --> 01:07:11.555
Did you know about this whole
thing and didn't warn anyone?

1173
01:07:11.638 --> 01:07:12.557
Your friend is injured.

1174
01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.559
I think you want to take--

1175
01:07:13.642 --> 01:07:14.268
No, I think you shouldn't.

1176
01:07:14.351 --> 01:07:14.728
Did you know--

1177
01:07:14.811 --> 01:07:16.565
Shut up!

1178
01:07:16.648 --> 01:07:18.026
Everybody just shut up.

1179
01:07:21.324 --> 01:07:23.244
Who are you?

1180
01:07:23.328 --> 01:07:25.248
My name is Jess Renfield.

1181
01:07:25.332 --> 01:07:29.089
Renfield, why are you here?

1182
01:07:29.173 --> 01:07:32.764
To bring you to safety and to
protect you in the meantime.

1183
01:07:32.847 --> 01:07:33.599
Are there others?

1184
01:07:33.682 --> 01:07:34.768
Yes.

1185
01:07:34.851 --> 01:07:36.605
They're preparing
right now to fight.

1186
01:07:36.688 --> 01:07:37.649
Preparing for what?

1187
01:07:37.732 --> 01:07:40.153
Shh!

1188
01:07:40.237 --> 01:07:41.280
Preparing for what?

1189
01:07:41.364 --> 01:07:44.495
Preparing to fight that evil.

1190
01:07:44.579 --> 01:07:46.290
Now you are welcome
to stay here and you

1191
01:07:46.374 --> 01:07:49.798
can see how far that gets you.

1192
01:07:49.881 --> 01:07:51.133
Or you can come with me.

1193
01:07:51.217 --> 01:07:53.137
You can all come
with me right now,

1194
01:07:53.221 --> 01:07:57.229
and we can move on because some
of us have better things to do.

1195
01:08:06.748 --> 01:08:08.251
We need to leave now.

1196
01:09:02.359 --> 01:09:03.779
I'm Waidmann.

1197
01:09:03.862 --> 01:09:06.618
You must have a
lot of questions.

1198
01:09:06.702 --> 01:09:07.954
Yeah.

1199
01:09:08.037 --> 01:09:09.289
Yeah, maybe a few.

1200
01:09:09.373 --> 01:09:10.458
It's cold out here.

1201
01:09:10.543 --> 01:09:11.586
I've got some hot
tea for you inside.

1202
01:09:17.389 --> 01:09:19.978
And you, Jess.

1203
01:09:20.061 --> 01:09:22.692
I believe I'll pass.

1204
01:09:22.775 --> 01:09:24.654
I admire your
will, Mr. Waidmann.

1205
01:09:24.738 --> 01:09:25.865
I do.

1206
01:09:25.948 --> 01:09:27.827
But you are fighting
something inside of you,

1207
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:30.081
and I cannot say
I approve at all.

1208
01:09:33.421 --> 01:09:36.511
If you make it through
tonight, perhaps our paths

1209
01:09:36.595 --> 01:09:39.851
will cross again.

1210
01:09:39.934 --> 01:09:42.690
Thank you, Jess.

1211
01:09:42.774 --> 01:09:45.028
Good luck.

1212
01:09:45.111 --> 01:09:45.654
And to you.

1213
01:10:10.036 --> 01:10:15.631
So is there something going on
here that we don't know about?

1214
01:10:15.714 --> 01:10:18.469
I'm assuming this isn't
some sort of deformed badger

1215
01:10:18.554 --> 01:10:21.100
or escaped zoo exhibit.

1216
01:10:21.183 --> 01:10:23.981
The creature stalking
you is not an animal.

1217
01:10:24.064 --> 01:10:27.822
He's an ancient being
known as a drude.

1218
01:10:27.905 --> 01:10:32.790
He was once a man, a
malefactor of the old world,

1219
01:10:32.874 --> 01:10:35.963
shriveled and degraded as
a reflection of the sins he

1220
01:10:36.046 --> 01:10:39.637
committed in the past life.

1221
01:10:39.721 --> 01:10:43.979
He's a creature of instinct,
hunger, pure animal impulse,

1222
01:10:44.062 --> 01:10:47.904
but otherwise entirely
indestructible.

1223
01:10:50.784 --> 01:10:53.164
Wait.

1224
01:10:53.247 --> 01:10:53.832
Wait.

1225
01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:54.834
I'm sorry.

1226
01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:56.170
I'm not really following.

1227
01:10:56.253 --> 01:11:00.554
Are you saying this thing
is a mystical monster?

1228
01:11:00.638 --> 01:11:03.852
A dread force whispered
about in German folklore.

1229
01:11:03.936 --> 01:11:06.858
Call it what you may.

1230
01:11:06.942 --> 01:11:08.737
The drude is a
servant of the Duke

1231
01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:12.537
of Crows, an ageless
entity that has wandered

1232
01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:18.548
the lonely forgotten highway of
history, once feared as a god.

1233
01:11:18.632 --> 01:11:19.759
No, no, I'm sorry.

1234
01:11:19.842 --> 01:11:21.220
I need to know if
this is something

1235
01:11:21.303 --> 01:11:22.890
that you actually believe.

1236
01:11:22.974 --> 01:11:25.563
I thought we were dealing
with some sort of institution,

1237
01:11:25.646 --> 01:11:26.731
like an--

1238
01:11:26.815 --> 01:11:27.775
I don't know-- a
specialized animal control

1239
01:11:27.858 --> 01:11:28.735
base or something.

1240
01:11:28.819 --> 01:11:32.075
Manny, you saw it.

1241
01:11:32.158 --> 01:11:34.121
Don't you think he may be
going somewhere with this?

1242
01:11:34.204 --> 01:11:36.250
Amy, please don't tell me
you're actually buying this.

1243
01:11:36.333 --> 01:11:37.962
Maybe not the whole
mystical whatever,

1244
01:11:38.045 --> 01:11:41.970
but there has to be
something more to this.

1245
01:11:42.053 --> 01:11:44.934
That thing was not from nature.

1246
01:11:45.018 --> 01:11:47.105
I don't believe this.

1247
01:11:47.188 --> 01:11:49.276
I can understand how
someone with a lack

1248
01:11:49.359 --> 01:11:52.282
of any form of spirituality
can have difficulty

1249
01:11:52.365 --> 01:11:54.662
coming to terms with this.

1250
01:11:54.746 --> 01:11:57.125
But I've been coming
here for years now,

1251
01:11:57.208 --> 01:12:00.632
trying to build the strength
to capture the drude.

1252
01:12:00.716 --> 01:12:04.640
OK, so why here?

1253
01:12:04.724 --> 01:12:07.813
In this nowhere
nothing, why here?

1254
01:12:07.897 --> 01:12:10.318
The drude doesn't
choose where to go.

1255
01:12:10.401 --> 01:12:11.988
It is summoned.

1256
01:12:12.072 --> 01:12:13.032
Yeah?

1257
01:12:13.115 --> 01:12:16.330
Then who summoned it?

1258
01:12:16.413 --> 01:12:20.046
I ask you how one would
hope to be rid of something

1259
01:12:20.129 --> 01:12:22.885
if one didn't know
where to find it.

1260
01:12:22.968 --> 01:12:25.014
What are you saying?

1261
01:12:25.098 --> 01:12:27.185
You found it?

1262
01:12:27.268 --> 01:12:29.022
You brought this thing here?

1263
01:12:29.106 --> 01:12:33.030
No, it was always here,
veiled in the silk and shadows

1264
01:12:33.114 --> 01:12:36.078
that divide this world
from the one beneath.

1265
01:12:36.161 --> 01:12:38.290
I merely gave it a seam
to which to birth itself.

1266
01:12:41.798 --> 01:12:42.633
Mitch, you OK?

1267
01:12:48.812 --> 01:12:51.066
Where is everyone else?

1268
01:12:51.150 --> 01:12:54.406
That Renfield guy.

1269
01:12:54.489 --> 01:12:56.744
There's got to be other
people here, right?

1270
01:12:56.828 --> 01:12:58.080
This can't be real.

1271
01:12:58.164 --> 01:13:00.293
What is real?

1272
01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:01.921
No, I'm out of here.

1273
01:13:02.005 --> 01:13:02.756
Manny.

1274
01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.760
We're going.

1275
01:13:04.844 --> 01:13:06.931
There's nowhere to go.

1276
01:13:07.015 --> 01:13:10.939
That creature was once a
man, one of God's creatures.

1277
01:13:11.023 --> 01:13:12.442
And if he is one
of Gods creatures,

1278
01:13:12.526 --> 01:13:14.780
then he is part of God.

1279
01:13:14.864 --> 01:13:21.126
And if he is part of God, then
God himself must be a sinner.

1280
01:13:21.210 --> 01:13:24.466
Man just may be
God's ultimate sin.

1281
01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:29.309
You've seen what he's
become, a hound of hell.

1282
01:13:29.392 --> 01:13:31.814
Wherever there is sin,
he will run to it,

1283
01:13:31.898 --> 01:13:35.989
like roots of a tree driving
through Earth toward water.

1284
01:13:36.073 --> 01:13:38.327
There's nowhere to go.

1285
01:13:38.410 --> 01:13:41.500
The evil surrounds you children.

1286
01:13:41.584 --> 01:13:44.840
The sins of the father run deep.

1287
01:13:44.924 --> 01:13:46.176
All right, then.

1288
01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:48.180
Then what's your big plan?

1289
01:13:48.264 --> 01:13:49.892
Hmm?

1290
01:13:49.976 --> 01:13:52.898
You're going to say a magic
spell and make him go away?

1291
01:13:52.982 --> 01:13:54.860
No.

1292
01:13:54.944 --> 01:14:00.079
The only magic that I know
is for making him stay.

1293
01:14:08.345 --> 01:14:10.224
Manny!

1294
01:14:10.308 --> 01:14:10.934
Manny!

1295
01:14:22.165 --> 01:14:23.543
Mind you, it is our impulse.

1296
01:14:27.509 --> 01:14:31.433
I need something with
intelligence, a mind, something

1297
01:14:31.517 --> 01:14:33.605
to bridge our world
with the one beneath

1298
01:14:33.688 --> 01:14:35.441
to bring this one to judgment.

1299
01:14:35.525 --> 01:14:39.867
Such a magnificent creature can
only be born of a virgin womb.

1300
01:14:44.209 --> 01:14:46.965
Run!

1301
01:14:47.048 --> 01:14:48.133
Transgressor!

1302
01:14:48.217 --> 01:14:48.968
Sinner!

1303
01:14:49.052 --> 01:14:50.471
Whore of the devil!

1304
01:14:50.555 --> 01:14:53.060
Can you honestly say you've
had a life of inequality?

1305
01:15:30.134 --> 01:15:33.223
This act will give meaning
to your miserable life.

1306
01:15:33.307 --> 01:15:36.229
Don't you want to be of
service, live with purpose?

1307
01:15:36.313 --> 01:15:38.400
You can't make me
go through with it.

1308
01:15:38.484 --> 01:15:39.653
You don't have much choice.

1309
01:15:49.673 --> 01:15:50.341
He's excited.

1310
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:06.541
The drude.

1311
01:16:09.713 --> 01:16:11.509
What was once a symbol
to ward off the beast

1312
01:16:11.592 --> 01:16:14.807
is now a fashion statement.

1313
01:16:14.890 --> 01:16:17.646
I guess I'll have to
cut it off you then.

1314
01:16:17.729 --> 01:16:20.150
No!

1315
01:17:00.649 --> 01:17:02.653
Do you think my drude
was the only one?

1316
01:17:13.675 --> 01:17:16.429
Fly, Duke.

1317
01:17:16.514 --> 01:17:17.014
Fly.

1318
01:17:36.052 --> 01:17:38.850
Manny!

1319
01:17:38.933 --> 01:17:39.560
Manny!

1320
01:17:47.909 --> 01:17:48.578
Not yet.

1321
01:17:59.600 --> 01:17:59.975
No.

1322
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:06.029
No.

1323
01:18:06.112 --> 01:18:06.781
Let's try to put it back.

1324
01:18:09.953 --> 01:18:13.335
But it's going to hurt a lot.

1325
01:19:10.575 --> 01:19:13.664
Well, Roy, it looks like we
made it through a whole shift

1326
01:19:13.748 --> 01:19:16.169
without your Bigfoot getting us.

1327
01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:17.839
And?

1328
01:19:17.923 --> 01:19:20.010
I'm not afraid of that nonsense.

1329
01:19:20.093 --> 01:19:22.515
There's scarier things
to be afraid of.

1330
01:19:22.599 --> 01:19:23.851
What, like bears?

1331
01:19:23.935 --> 01:19:28.193
You seem pretty scared
when it was bears.

1332
01:19:28.276 --> 01:19:32.702
When I was a little guy, I
found this rusty old nail

1333
01:19:32.786 --> 01:19:34.706
in the driveway.

1334
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:37.879
So I put it in my
little air gun.

1335
01:19:37.963 --> 01:19:43.223
When I got into the kitchen,
my aunt was up on a stool,

1336
01:19:43.306 --> 01:19:45.895
putting dishes away.

1337
01:19:45.979 --> 01:19:48.066
I pointed my gun right at her.

1338
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:55.080
And I said, auntie,
I'm going to shoot you.

1339
01:19:55.163 --> 01:19:58.921
Well, she went on like
I wasn't even there.

1340
01:19:59.005 --> 01:20:02.762
So I shot her, right in the ass.

1341
01:20:02.846 --> 01:20:09.609
That was one mean
hospital ride, I'll tell you.

1342
01:20:09.693 --> 01:20:15.621
Well, my point is, it's people
that are the real monsters, not

1343
01:20:15.705 --> 01:20:19.128
this fairy tale bullshit.

1344
01:20:19.211 --> 01:20:21.007
Well, maybe it's
a bit of both, Al.

1345
01:20:21.090 --> 01:20:22.301
Good day, buddy.

1346
01:20:22.384 --> 01:20:24.973
Yeah, see ya.

1347
01:20:25.057 --> 01:20:25.892
Oh, man.

1348
01:20:36.914 --> 01:20:37.665
Hey, pal.

1349
01:20:37.749 --> 01:20:38.249
We're closed.

1350
01:20:47.309 --> 01:20:49.021
Hey, pal.

1351
01:20:49.105 --> 01:20:54.365
What part of the phrase "we're
closed" is confusing you?

1352
01:21:04.970 --> 01:21:08.894
<i>Then one night,</i>
<i>you're walking down the street.</i>

1353
01:21:08.978 --> 01:21:12.902
<i>A big bonfire, and you're</i>
<i>dancing to your feet.</i>

1354
01:21:12.986 --> 01:21:15.741
<i>Don't feel right at the thought.</i>

1355
01:21:15.825 --> 01:21:19.415
<i>It just won't break</i>
<i>because keep in mind you'll</i>

1356
01:21:19.498 --> 01:21:22.087
<i>last with.</i>

1357
01:21:22.171 --> 01:21:26.972
<i>Release the drude</i>
<i>It's coming for you.</i>

1358
01:21:27.055 --> 01:21:30.980
<i>It starts under the moon.</i>

1359
01:21:31.063 --> 01:21:33.944
<i>The Duke of Crows is here.</i>

1360
01:21:34.028 --> 01:21:39.288
<i>He'll know the</i>
<i>secrets of a dream.</i>

1361
01:21:39.371 --> 01:21:40.123
<i>Don't hold back!</i>

1362
01:21:40.207 --> 01:21:42.962
<i>You'll never get away.</i>

1363
01:21:43.046 --> 01:21:46.970
<i>Hack and slice until</i>
<i>the light of day.</i>

1364
01:21:47.054 --> 01:21:48.306
<i>It won't die!</i>

1365
01:21:48.389 --> 01:21:50.978
<i>I guess you better run.</i>

1366
01:21:51.062 --> 01:21:55.403
<i>You won't be safe</i>
<i>after the setting sun.</i>

1367
01:22:03.419 --> 01:22:04.881
<i>Hear its breath.</i>

1368
01:22:04.965 --> 01:22:07.344
<i>It's right behind.</i>

1369
01:22:07.427 --> 01:22:11.352
<i>No time left, it's in your mind.</i>

1370
01:22:11.435 --> 01:22:15.360
<i>Demons come to.</i>

1371
01:22:15.443 --> 01:22:20.871
<i>Open up and let</i>
<i>them, let them in.</i>

1372
01:22:20.955 --> 01:22:25.255
<i>Release the drude</i>
<i>It wants its food.</i>

1373
01:22:25.338 --> 01:22:33.229
<i>The Duke of</i>
<i>Crows, the dreams he shows,</i>

1374
01:22:36.987 --> 01:22:38.239
<i>Don't hold back!</i>

1375
01:22:38.323 --> 01:22:41.245
<i>You'll never get away.</i>

1376
01:22:41.329 --> 01:22:44.919
<i>Hack and slash until</i>
<i>the light of day.</i>

1377
01:22:45.003 --> 01:22:46.297
<i>It won't die!</i>

1378
01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:49.136
<i>I guess you better run.</i>

1379
01:22:49.219 --> 01:22:53.186
<i>You won't be safe</i>
<i>after the setting sun.</i>

1380
01:23:01.243 --> 01:23:03.122
<i>Hetzhund!</i>

1381
01:23:03.206 --> 01:23:05.460
<i>Hetzhund!</i>

1382
01:23:05.544 --> 01:23:07.130
<i>Hetzhund!</i>

1383
01:23:07.214 --> 01:23:08.341
Upset me you're back in town

1384
01:23:08.424 --> 01:23:11.305
Fuck, OK, God damn it, man.

1385
01:23:11.389 --> 01:23:12.140
I'm sorry.

1386
01:23:12.224 --> 01:23:13.309
Fuck you, man.

1387
01:23:13.393 --> 01:23:14.478
I hate you.

1388
01:23:14.562 --> 01:23:15.146
OK, thank you.

1389
01:23:15.230 --> 01:23:15.981
Reset.

1390
01:23:16.065 --> 01:23:16.984
Give me one more.
