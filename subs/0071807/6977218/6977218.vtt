85

there and trained him
in Europe

underpaid assassin.

89

00:31:37.145 --> 00:31:39.438
I don't know where.
He doesn't tell me
everything.

382
00:31:39.522 --> 00:31:42.900

at the Bottoms Up

recognize him?

384

about him?

Yes, but how can I...

388
00:31:53.494 --> 00:31:55.746

Unless of course
the Bottoms Up
is a strip club

393
00:32:06.257 --> 00:32:08.926

performing there.

to do better.

So I'll tell you what
you're going to do,
Miss Anders.

401
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:36.453
You're going to take
those golden bullets
to Mr. Scaramanga

402
00:32:36.537 --> 00:32:38.121
because if he
doesn't get them,

403
00:32:38.206 --> 00:32:40.290
he may not show up
at the Bottoms Up.

404
00:32:42.585 --> 00:32:44.544
And I want him there.

405
00:32:45.296 --> 00:32:46.713

He may even use one
of those little golden

be a pity

I almost wish that
Scaramanga had a

470
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:44.125
Was Gibson cooperative?

471
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:46.044
He wanted to
bargain for immunity.

472

00:41:48.756 --> 00:41:49.881

he worked there for

come up before.

propose bargaining
with, Lieutenant?

was 95% efficient.

481

solved the energy crisis.

in his pocket.

496

it wasn't there.

497
00:42:47.898 --> 00:42:49.357

M: Gentlemen,
I congratulate you.

499
00:42:53.487 --> 00:42:55.822

our hands on a

500
00:42:55.906 --> 00:42:59.242
we're left with

and no leads.

501
00:42:59.994 --> 00:43:01.536
One lead, sir.

502
00:43:02.496 --> 00:43:05.748
Assuming Gibson was
killed by Scaramanga,

503
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.960
whoever hired him
could afford
a million dollars.

504
00:43:09.044 --> 00:43:10.795
Are you suggesting
Hai Fat?

505
00:43:10.879 --> 00:43:12.797
He could afford it.

506
00:43:12.881 --> 00:43:14.591
Out of petty cash.

507
00:43:15.509 --> 00:43:17.468
A thought has just
occurred to me, sir.

508
00:43:17.553 --> 00:43:19.679
If Hai Fat hired
Scaramanga,

509
00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:23.099
it's highly unlikely
that he met him personally.

510
00:43:23.183 --> 00:43:24.267
Why?

511
00:43:24.351 --> 00:43:25.602
In the event of
anything going wrong,

512
00:43:25.686 --> 00:43:27.770
there's nothing
to connect the two.

513
00:43:27.855 --> 00:43:30.982
And that gives me
an idea as to how
to approach him.

514
00:43:31.066 --> 00:43:33.860
Q, I'll need this.

515
00:43:36.864 --> 00:43:38.656

516
00:43:38.741 --> 00:43:41.367

it's a little kinky.

Mr. Scaramanga.

551

your abnormality
was a myth.

it is considered a sign
of invulnerability

556
00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:45.426

the gentleman?

Without being
immodest,

560
00:46:50.307 --> 00:46:53.392
there's hardly anyone
in this part of the

561
00:46:53.477 --> 00:46:56.729

few people who haven't
heard of Bond.

He's good, even

564
00:47:03.695 --> 00:47:05.154
He was near the
Bottoms Up Club.

565
00:47:05.239 --> 00:47:07.073
A coincidence.

566
00:47:07.157 --> 00:47:09.116

567
00:47:09.576 --> 00:47:12.286
The man's a menace.
He knows something.

568
00:47:12.371 --> 00:47:16.165
Are you suggesting
I invest another
million to remove him?

569
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:18.084
That's up to you.

570
00:47:18.168 --> 00:47:20.670
I will give it
some thought.

571
00:47:20.754 --> 00:47:23.214

chosen to meet me,

572
00:47:23.298 --> 00:47:25.466
perhaps you will
dine here tonight.

573
00:47:25.551 --> 00:47:26.717

to dinner.

578
00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:53.327

quite titillating.

579

01:34:01.636 --> 01:34:04.512
Yes, it's a guest
I'm expecting.

1056
01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:09.267
No, he won't
be leaving.

will welcome you
personally.

1067
01:35:52.371 --> 01:35:54.038
Forgive me,
Mr. Bond.

1068
01:35:54.123 --> 01:35:57.292
A vulgar display,
but I couldn't
resist it

1069
01:35:57.376 --> 01:36:00.295
because I am so
delighted to see
you again.

1070
01:36:00.713 --> 01:36:02.380
A harmless toy.

1073
01:36:10.181 --> 01:36:11.765
We have so much
in common, Mr. Bond.

1074
01:36:11.849 --> 01:36:13.099
We have so much
to discuss,

1075
01:36:13.184 --> 01:36:15.477
and we will
never have this
opportunity again.

1076
01:36:15.561 --> 01:36:17.270
Ours is the
loneliest profession,

1077
01:36:17.354 --> 01:36:20.690
so let us spend
a few pleasant
hours together.

1078

How can I refuse
such a gracious
invitation?

1079
01:36:23.444 --> 01:36:25.195
Splendid.
Splendid!

1080
01:36:25.905 --> 01:36:28.990
Nick Nack,
I expect you to
surpass yourself.

1081
01:36:29.074 --> 01:36:30.533
He's a Cordon Bleu,
you know.

1082
01:36:30.618 --> 01:36:32.869
By the way, where's
Miss Goodnight?

1083
01:36:34.872 --> 01:36:37.207
Oh, she's around
here somewhere.

1084
01:36:37.291 --> 01:36:38.458
There's no way
for her to leave,

1085
01:36:38.542 --> 01:36:40.335
so she does
as she pleases.

1086
01:36:40.419 --> 01:36:42.462
How do you
like my island?

1087
01:36:42.546 --> 01:36:44.380

isn't it?

It's rent-free.
I do my landlords
an occasional favor.

I suppose.

1091
01:36:51.847 --> 01:36:53.348
Not at all.

1092
01:36:53.432 --> 01:36:56.017
Nick Nack does
for me very nicely.

1093
01:36:58.395 --> 01:36:59.813
Usually there's just
the two of us,

1094
01:36:59.897 --> 01:37:01.397
but having guests
is no inconvenience.

1095
01:37:01.482 --> 01:37:02.816
We're entirely
self-supporting.

1096
01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:04.567
We have every electrical
laborsaving device

1097
01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:06.569
you could
possibly think of.

1098
01:37:06.904 --> 01:37:10.156
This is an air lock,
as you are doubtless
aware.

1099
01:37:12.701 --> 01:37:14.536
Automatic,
of course.

01:37:16.288 --> 01:37:19.874
Naturally, we have
an ample supply of
electricity here.

So this is what
it's all about.

1106
01:37:52.783 --> 01:37:54.868
Thermoelectric
generators to convert

1107
01:37:54.952 --> 01:37:56.995
solar energy
into electricity.

1108
01:37:57.955 --> 01:38:00.748
All built by Hai Fat's
construction company,
no doubt.

1109
01:38:00.833 --> 01:38:03.418
Somehow I seem to have
inherited it from him.

1110
01:38:03.502 --> 01:38:05.295
It's all fully automated.

1111
01:38:05.379 --> 01:38:06.963
That's Kra,
maintenance
and security.

everything in here.

1113
01:38:08.424 --> 01:38:11.009
Nick Nack does everything else
when he isn't polishing
the silver.

1114
01:38:11.093 --> 01:38:15.054
They tell me the
electricity is stored
in here somewhere.

1115
01:38:15.139 --> 01:38:17.807
Science was never
my strong point.

1116
01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:22.770

cooled by liquid helium.

I wouldn't stick
my finger,

1118
01:38:26.525 --> 01:38:29.068
or anything else for
that matter, in there.

1119
01:38:29.153 --> 01:38:31.446
At 453 degrees
below zero,

1120
01:38:31.530 --> 01:38:34.240
that liquid helium
would break it off
like an icicle.

1121
01:38:34.325 --> 01:38:37.076
You really know far
more about it than
I do, Mr. Bond.

1122
01:38:37.161 --> 01:38:39.537
I'm arranging for
every country that
can afford the price

1123
01:38:39.622 --> 01:38:41.998
to send their experts here
to see for themselves.

1124
01:38:42.082 --> 01:38:45.501
But no solex until
the money is in
the bank. Right?

1125
01:38:46.170 --> 01:38:47.170
Right.

1126
01:38:47.254 --> 01:38:49.839
I have run across
similar situations.

1127
01:38:49.924 --> 01:38:51.674
Not what I've got here.

1128
01:38:51.759 --> 01:38:53.635
This way the highest
bidder can build

1129
01:38:53.719 --> 01:38:54.928
hundreds of
these stations

1130
01:38:55.012 --> 01:38:57.847
and sell franchises
for hundreds more.

1131
01:38:58.891 --> 01:39:02.268
He will literally
have the sun in
his pocket.

1132
01:39:02.353 --> 01:39:04.437
A monopoly on
solar power.

1133
01:39:05.814 --> 01:39:09.150
The oil sheiks will pay
you just to keep solar
energy off the market.

1134
01:39:09.234 --> 01:39:11.694
The thought had
occurred to me.

1135
01:39:16.450 --> 01:39:18.826
This is the
collection point.

1136
01:39:32.174 --> 01:39:35.718

where it belongs.

1137

Our famous solex in
the still down there

the thermal generators.

1139
01:39:43.519 --> 01:39:45.728
It's collected
through this?

1140
01:39:49.441 --> 01:39:51.067
But where is it
collected from?

1141
01:39:51.151 --> 01:39:52.735
You need the sun.

1143
01:40:27.146 --> 01:40:28.604
Ingenious, isn't it?

1144
01:40:28.689 --> 01:40:32.025
The panels lock on to
the sun and then track
it automatically.

1145
01:40:32.109 --> 01:40:34.318

that, yes.

Ah.

1148
01:40:42.494 --> 01:40:45.329
Reflected through this,
those panels must
produce a heat

1149

I'll show you.

1154

This is a bonus.

1155
01:41:04.475 --> 01:41:07.143

Ah. Mushrooms.

The fried mushroom
looks terribly
interesting.

1174
01:42:46.493 --> 01:42:49.787
Yes, I noticed that.
I'll get around to
it later.

1175

1176
01:42:55.085 --> 01:42:56.586
Yes.

1177
01:42:57.254 --> 01:42:59.380
I could stay
here forever.

1178
01:43:01.425 --> 01:43:03.176
Hmm!

1179
01:43:03.427 --> 01:43:04.468
Excellent.

1180
01:43:04.553 --> 01:43:07.263
Slightly reminiscent
of a '34 Mouton.

1181
01:43:07.347 --> 01:43:09.724
Then I must add
it to my cellar.

1182
01:43:11.310 --> 01:43:13.603
You live well,

1183
01:43:14.188 --> 01:43:17.940
At a million dollars
a contract, I can
afford to, Mr. Bond.

1184
01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:19.859
You work for peanuts.

1185
01:43:19.943 --> 01:43:22.195
A hearty "well done"
from Her Majesty
the Queen

1186
01:43:22.279 --> 01:43:23.696
and a pittance
of a pension.

1187
01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:25.865
Apart from that,
we are the same.

1188
01:43:27.576 --> 01:43:29.702
To us, Mr. Bond.

1189
01:43:29.786 --> 01:43:31.537
We are the best.

1190
01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:35.249
There's a useful
four-letter word,

1191
01:43:35.334 --> 01:43:36.792
and you're
full of it.

1192
01:43:39.922 --> 01:43:43.049
When I kill, it's on
the specific orders
of my government.

1193
01:43:43.133 --> 01:43:46.052
And those I kill are
themselves killers.

1194
01:43:46.136 --> 01:43:47.845
Oh, come, come,
Mr. Bond.

1195
01:43:47.930 --> 01:43:49.055
You disappoint me.

1196
01:43:49.139 --> 01:43:51.140
You get as much
fulfillment out
of killing as I do,

1197
01:43:51.225 --> 01:43:52.475
so why don't
you admit it?

1198
01:43:52.559 --> 01:43:55.019
I admit killing you
would be a pleasure.

1199
01:43:55.103 --> 01:43:56.896
You should've done that
when you first saw me.

1200
01:43:56.980 --> 01:43:58.397
But then of course
the English don't
consider it

1201
01:43:58.482 --> 01:44:01.400
sporting to kill in
cold blood, do they?

1202
01:44:01.735 --> 01:44:03.778
Don't count on that.

1203
01:44:14.831 --> 01:44:16.624
I could've shot you
down when you landed

1204
01:44:16.708 --> 01:44:19.126
but that would've
been ridiculously easy.

1205
01:44:23.048 --> 01:44:26.717
You see, Mr. Bond,
like every great artist,

1206
01:44:26.802 --> 01:44:28.928
I want to create
an indisputable

1207
01:44:29.012 --> 01:44:31.347
masterpiece once
in my lifetime.

1208
01:44:32.599 --> 01:44:34.600

face to face,

1211
01:44:38.772 --> 01:44:40.356
will be mine.

1212
01:44:41.233 --> 01:44:45.444
You mean, stuffed
and displayed over
your rocky mantelpiece?

1213
01:44:45.529 --> 01:44:49.448
That's an amusing idea,
but I was thinking
in terms of history.

1214
01:44:49.533 --> 01:44:51.701
A duel between titans.

1215
01:44:52.494 --> 01:44:55.454
My golden gun
against your
Walther PPK.

1216
01:44:55.956 --> 01:44:58.624
Each of us with
a 50-50 chance.

1217
01:44:58.709 --> 01:45:01.127
Six bullets
to your one?

1218
01:45:01.211 --> 01:45:02.878
I only need one.

1219
01:45:05.882 --> 01:45:08.050
Sounds a bit oId-fashioned,
doesn't it?

1220
01:45:08.135 --> 01:45:11.137
I mean, pistols at dawn,
that sort of thing.

1221
01:45:11.221 --> 01:45:13.222
Indeed, it is,
Mr. Bond,

1222
01:45:13.890 --> 01:45:17.393
but it still remains
the only true test
for gentlemen.

1223
01:45:17.936 --> 01:45:20.604
