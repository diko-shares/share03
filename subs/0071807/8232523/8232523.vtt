1
00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:51.110
Nick Nack, Tabasco!

2
00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:53.529
Right away,
Monsieur Scaramanga.

3
00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:20.931
Hey.

4
00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:25.227
Half.

5
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.437
You get the rest later.

6
00:02:34.028 --> 00:02:36.905
Wait for him in there,
through that door.

7
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.786
He will join you
in a minute.

8
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:14.568
Your steam bath is ready,
Monsieur Scaramanga.

9
00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:19.925
Oh!

10
00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.427
That would have
been too easy.

11
00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:24.012
It's locked.

12
00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:28.976
You'll have to look
elsewhere, monsieur.

13
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:57.647
Hey, AI. AI.

14
00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:01.610
Wherever you are,
don't hold it against me.

15
00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:12.996
I wonder where you can find your gun,
Monsieur Scaramanga.

16
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.458
Your little golden gun.

17
00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:22.381
Where can it be?

18
00:06:25.968 --> 00:06:29.012
There is something
we haven't had before.

19
00:06:31.557 --> 00:06:33.725
I wonder what it can be.

20
00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:41.858
I fooled you.

21
00:06:45.988 --> 00:06:47.989
You're getting warmer.

22
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.161
Much warmer.

23
00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:22.065
Now, how are you going
to get down the stairs?

24
00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:26.027
So near and yet so far.

25
00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:52.471
Bravo, Monsieur
Scaramanga.

26
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.931
You've done it again.

27
00:07:58.936 --> 00:08:00.770
This one was the best,
n'est-ce pas?

28
00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:02.898
Not bad.
Not bad at all.

29
00:08:03.232 --> 00:08:04.316
But You'll have to
do better than that

30
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.817
if you want to
come into my money.

31
00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:09.529
I'll get you yet, and I'll enjoy
every soul you leave me.

32
00:08:10.114 --> 00:08:12.949
You'll be the death
of me yet, Nick Nack.

33
00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:42.437
He has
a powerful weapon

34
00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:45.774
He charges a million a shot

35
00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:49.528
An assassin that's
second to none

36
00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:54.616
The man with the golden gun

37
00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:58.453
Lurking in some
darkened doorway

38
00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:02.040
Or crouched on
a rooftop somewhere

39
00:09:02.124 --> 00:09:05.210
In the next room,
or this very one

40
00:09:05.294 --> 00:09:10.465
The man with the golden gun

41
00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:14.302
Love is required
whenever he's hired

42
00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:17.639
It comes just before the kill

43
00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:21.226
No one can catch him,
no hit man can match him

44
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.187
For his million-dollar skill

45
00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:28.149
One golden shot means
another poor victim

46
00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:32.362
Has come to a glittering end

47
00:09:32.446 --> 00:09:35.240
For a price,
He'll erase anyone

48
00:09:35.324 --> 00:09:39.119
The man with the golden gun

49
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:46.626
His eye may be on you or me

50
00:09:47.628 --> 00:09:51.756
Who will he bang?

51
00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:58.138
We shall see

52
00:09:58.472 --> 00:10:01.516
Oh, yeah!

53
00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:06.438
Love is required
whenever he's hired

54
00:10:06.522 --> 00:10:09.774
It comes just before the kill

55
00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:13.236
No one can catch him,
no hit man can match him

56
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:16.364
For his million-dollar skill

57
00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:20.285
One golden shot means
another poor victim

58
00:10:20.369 --> 00:10:24.039
Has come to a glittering end

59
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.542
If you want to
get rid of someone

60
00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:30.462
The man with the golden gun

61
00:10:30.546 --> 00:10:32.881
will get it done

62
00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:36.718
He'll shoot anyone

63
00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:43.725
With his golden gun

64
00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.069
Good morning, sir.

65
00:10:56.947 --> 00:10:58.406
Colthorpe.

66
00:10:59.241 --> 00:11:01.117
Chief of Staff.

67
00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:03.828
What do you know about a man called
Scaramanga, 007?

68
00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.580
Scaramanga?

69
00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:10.960
Oh, yes. The Man
with the golden Gun.

70
00:11:11.045 --> 00:11:13.505
Born in a circus.
Father, the ringmaster, possibly Cuban.

71
00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:15.423
Mother, English,
a snake charmer.

72
00:11:15.716 --> 00:11:18.468
He was a spectacular
trick shot artist by the time he was 10

73
00:11:18.552 --> 00:11:20.887
and a local Rio
gunman at 15.

74
00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:23.932
The KGB recruited him
there and trained him in Europe

75
00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:27.936
where he became
an overworked, underpaid assassin.

76
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.563
He went independent
in the late '50s.

77
00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:32.857
Current price,
$1 million a hit.

78
00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:35.485
No photograph on file.

79
00:11:35.569 --> 00:11:39.072
But he does have one distinguishing
feature, however,

80
00:11:39.156 --> 00:11:40.532
a superfluous papilla.

81
00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:41.658
A what?

82
00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:42.992
A mammary gland.

83
00:11:43.786 --> 00:11:45.662
A third nipple, sir.

84
00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:49.499
He always uses a golden bullet, hence,
Man with the golden Gun.

85
00:11:49.583 --> 00:11:51.626
Present domicile
unknown.

86
00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:53.712
I think that's all.

87
00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.131
Why, sir?

88
00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:00.176
Hmm.

89
00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:01.886
Charming trinket.

90
00:12:02.805 --> 00:12:04.305
Even has my
number on it.

91
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.682
Precisely.

92
00:12:05.766 --> 00:12:08.393
Obviously it's
useless as a bullet.

93
00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:11.396
I mean, sir, who would
pay a million dollars to have me killed?

94
00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.733
Jealous husbands, outraged chefs,
humiliated tailors.

95
00:12:14.817 --> 00:12:16.317
The list is endless.

96
00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:19.070
Moreover, this trinket,
as you call it,

97
00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:23.700
was sent with a note requesting
special delivery to you.

98
00:12:24.493 --> 00:12:26.327
It's initialed
with an "S".

99
00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:28.455
Scaramanga's fingerprints
were on it.

100
00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:31.499
They've been
verified by the CIA.

101
00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:33.376
Why would he alert me?

102
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:35.253
Psychological.

103
00:12:35.337 --> 00:12:38.214
He counts on his reputation to terrify
his intended victim.

104
00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:40.175
Thank you, gentlemen.

105
00:12:49.518 --> 00:12:52.896
I'm relieving you
of your present assignment, 007.

106
00:12:56.358 --> 00:12:57.817
Sir?
Yes?

107
00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:01.738
The energy crisis
is still with us.

108
00:13:02.573 --> 00:13:05.450
I respectfully submit
that finding Gibson

109
00:13:05.534 --> 00:13:08.286
and his solar cell data
is even more important than ever.

110
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:09.871
It is indeed.

111
00:13:10.539 --> 00:13:13.124
And I can't jeopardize it
or any mission

112
00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:16.795
by having Scaramanga
pop up and put a bullet in you.

113
00:13:17.713 --> 00:13:20.256
I'll endorse your
request to resign.

114
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.759
Or you can take
a sabbatical and

115
00:13:22.843 --> 00:13:24.803
go to ground until
this matter's settled.

116
00:13:25.262 --> 00:13:26.638
Or until he kills me.

117
00:13:26.722 --> 00:13:29.682
Nobody knows where he is
or what he looks like.

118
00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:33.770
So I think it's fair to assume that he has
the edge on you.

119
00:13:34.563 --> 00:13:37.232
wouldn't you agree?
That's all, 007.

120
00:13:46.867 --> 00:13:49.077
If I found
him first, sir,

121
00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:52.080
that might change
the situation.

122
00:13:52.581 --> 00:13:54.082
Dramatically.

123
00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:56.417
wouldn't you say?

124
00:13:58.087 --> 00:13:59.587
Good day, Bond.

125
00:14:07.763 --> 00:14:09.806
Moneypenny, Fairbanks...

126
00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:10.932
Alaska?

127
00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:13.226
No, Bill Fairbanks, 002.

128
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.854
Oh, poor Bill.
I miss him.

129
00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:17.730
The Man with
the golden Gun didn't.

130
00:14:17.815 --> 00:14:20.358
Officially, that was
never confirmed.

131
00:14:20.442 --> 00:14:22.735
Where was 002
when it happened?

132
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.487
Beirut, '69.

133
00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:27.949
In a cabaret with
a lady called Saida.

134
00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:29.576
Beirut, hmm?

135
00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:32.871
Moneypenny, you are better
than a computer.

136
00:14:32.955 --> 00:14:34.831
In all sorts of ways.

137
00:14:36.333 --> 00:14:38.877
But you never take
advantage of them.

138
00:14:38.961 --> 00:14:40.879
Miss Moneypenny.
Yes, sir.

139
00:14:43.757 --> 00:14:46.050
Oh, just one
moment, darling.

140
00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:47.969
Yes, James?

141
00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:51.097
Why wasn't Scaramanga
confirmed as the killer?

142
00:14:51.181 --> 00:14:54.017
Because they couldn’t
find the bullet,

143
00:14:55.811 --> 00:14:57.270
darling.

144
00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:30.887
Ahmed.

145
00:16:14.598 --> 00:16:17.350
Good evening.
My name is Bond.

146
00:16:17.434 --> 00:16:18.893
James Bond.

147
00:16:20.896 --> 00:16:22.897
Your dancing is superb.

148
00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:24.899
So are you.

149
00:16:29.613 --> 00:16:31.698
And you are
very handsome.

150
00:16:32.908 --> 00:16:36.244
well, I don't usually
intrude like this, but I...

151
00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:39.580
I believe we had
a mutual friend.

152
00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:41.040
Bill Fairbanks.

153
00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:42.166
Fairbanks?

154
00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:44.502
Yes.

155
00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:47.672
I'm told you
were with him

156
00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:50.842
when he was rather
rudely interrupted.

157
00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:54.512
Bill. What a
terrible night.

158
00:16:54.596 --> 00:16:56.347
I will never
forget it.

159
00:16:56.432 --> 00:16:57.974
Did you see
who shot him?

160
00:16:58.058 --> 00:16:59.517
No. I was
in his arms.

161
00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:01.561
My eyes were closed.

162
00:17:02.062 --> 00:17:03.479
At least he died happy.

163
00:17:03.564 --> 00:17:05.732
The bullet went
through him.

164
00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:09.569
Through his back
and ended up there?

165
00:17:09.653 --> 00:17:11.821
No, no,
through his neck.

166
00:17:11.905 --> 00:17:15.033
I take it out of the wall before
the police arrive.

167
00:17:15.117 --> 00:17:17.618
And now it is
my lucky charm.

168
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.288
I never dance without it.

169
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.583
I'm sure Bill would
have loved that.

170
00:17:26.462 --> 00:17:28.629
But let us
forget the past.

171
00:17:29.173 --> 00:17:30.590
Hmm.

172
00:17:30.674 --> 00:17:32.759
I was hoping
you'd say that.

173
00:17:32.843 --> 00:17:35.136
Are you staying
long in Beirut?

174
00:17:35.804 --> 00:17:37.472
It depends.

175
00:17:55.783 --> 00:17:57.450
Clumsy of me.

176
00:18:07.503 --> 00:18:10.797
You really do have
a magnificent abdomen.

177
00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:23.976
Oh,
my perfumes! No!

178
00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:39.886
I've lost my charm!

179
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.598
Not from where
I'm standing.

180
00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:52.356
Taxi? Hotel, mister?

181
00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:54.942
No. The nearest pharmacy.

182
00:19:58.614 --> 00:20:02.116
Dumdum bullets
like this flatten on impact

183
00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:03.868
for maximum
wounding effect.

184
00:20:03.952 --> 00:20:05.286
Very nasty.

185
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.038
Yes. I'm sure it is.

186
00:20:07.122 --> 00:20:09.582
But just tell me where it was made
and by whom.

187
00:20:09.666 --> 00:20:12.293
Fortunately it's
all in one piece.

188
00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:15.129
20. 003 grams.

189
00:20:15.505 --> 00:20:19.050
Which leads us to deduce it was fired
from a 4.2 millimeter gun.

190
00:20:19.134 --> 00:20:21.510
Colthorpe, there's no
such thing as a 4.2 millimeter gun.

191
00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:25.431
The fact that no recognized munitions
manufacturer,

192
00:20:25.515 --> 00:20:28.142
military or civil,
produces such a bullet

193
00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:30.728
doesn't mean it
doesn't exist, 007.

194
00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.564
Q Branch have
been making irregular calibers

195
00:20:33.649 --> 00:20:35.650
for most
unusual purposes.

196
00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:38.194
And we don't put markings or serial
numbers on them.

197
00:20:38.278 --> 00:20:41.030
Making identification
almost impossible.

198
00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:43.950
You mean to say
there's no way to trace that bullet?

199
00:20:44.034 --> 00:20:45.910
You have no idea what it went through
to get here.

200
00:20:45.994 --> 00:20:48.454
I wouldn't go so
far as to say that.

201
00:20:48.538 --> 00:20:50.331
The workmanship
is undemanding

202
00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:52.041
according to
our standards.

203
00:20:52.125 --> 00:20:55.962
Soft 23 karat gold
with traces of nickel.

204
00:20:56.546 --> 00:20:59.423
Hardly ever used in Europe.
Comes from India.

205
00:20:59.508 --> 00:21:01.008
The Far East?

206
00:21:02.302 --> 00:21:03.761
Why not India?

207
00:21:03.845 --> 00:21:06.514
Nickel content
obviously too low, 007.

208
00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.267
Lazar?

209
00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:12.144
Hmm.

210
00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:15.648
Imaginative.
Highly specialized.

211
00:21:16.191 --> 00:21:17.775
Yes, I concur.

212
00:21:23.198 --> 00:21:24.782
well, what the
hell is Lazar?

213
00:21:24.866 --> 00:21:27.076
Not what. Who.
Portuguese.

214
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.452
Lives in Macau.

215
00:21:28.537 --> 00:21:31.080
Chap who made
the bullet, 007.

216
00:21:58.025 --> 00:21:59.817
I hate to
interrupt your dinner,

217
00:21:59.901 --> 00:22:01.902
but does Senior
Lazar live here?

218
00:22:04.698 --> 00:22:05.948
Lazar.

219
00:22:09.703 --> 00:22:11.871
I was given
this address.

220
00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:15.583
Does he...
Senior Lazar?

221
00:22:18.128 --> 00:22:21.088
My name's Bond.
James Bond.

222
00:22:21.423 --> 00:22:23.758
An unexpected
honor, Mr. Bond.

223
00:22:24.259 --> 00:22:25.676
Your reputation
precedes you.

224
00:22:25.761 --> 00:22:27.261
This way, please.

225
00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:34.602
It would be the
proudest moment of my career

226
00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:37.229
if I could make something for you,
Mr. Bond.

227
00:22:37.314 --> 00:22:38.856
A rifle, perhaps?

228
00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.776
Now, here we have
an interesting problem.

229
00:22:42.736 --> 00:22:44.904
A custom-built
model for a client

230
00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:49.408
who recently lost two fingers.
Please.

231
00:22:49.493 --> 00:22:51.077
He also lost
his trigger.

232
00:22:51.161 --> 00:22:53.996
It is housed in the butt.
Squeeze it.

233
00:23:06.259 --> 00:23:08.302
The sights
are a bit off.

234
00:23:08.845 --> 00:23:10.638
You have
five fingers.

235
00:23:10.722 --> 00:23:13.057
The butt is balanced
for the pressure of three.

236
00:23:13.141 --> 00:23:15.810
That is why you
were one inch too low.

237
00:23:16.812 --> 00:23:20.147
Here you will find
only craftsmanship and quality.

238
00:23:21.108 --> 00:23:22.650
Mass production,

239
00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:26.862
your Walther PPK, for instance,
I leave to others.

240
00:23:27.072 --> 00:23:28.572
What about
ammunition?

241
00:23:28.657 --> 00:23:32.243
Designed to individual requirements
whatever they may be.

242
00:23:32.327 --> 00:23:34.495
In gold,
if I wanted?

243
00:23:34.996 --> 00:23:36.997
I have already done
that for a client.

244
00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:38.999
I know you have.

245
00:23:39.084 --> 00:23:41.085
Francisco Scaramanga.

246
00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:44.922
My relationship with a client,
Mr. Bond,

247
00:23:45.006 --> 00:23:47.049
is strictly confidential.

248
00:23:48.009 --> 00:23:50.219
Like a doctor or
priest with a penitent.

249
00:23:50.303 --> 00:23:51.679
Of course.

250
00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:55.766
Yet you make guns
for fingerless hoodlums,

251
00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:57.518
bullets for assassins.

252
00:23:57.602 --> 00:24:00.771
Mr. Bond,
bullets do not kill.

253
00:24:00.856 --> 00:24:02.606
It is the finger
that pulls the trigger.

254
00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:04.066
Exactly.

255
00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:09.071
I'm now aiming
precisely at your groin.

256
00:24:10.907 --> 00:24:13.325
So speak, or forever
hold your "piece."

257
00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:15.578
I have never seen
Mr. Scaramanga.

258
00:24:15.662 --> 00:24:19.331
On a cost-per-bullet basis,
he must be your best customer.

259
00:24:19.708 --> 00:24:20.791
That is true,
but unfortunately

260
00:24:20.876 --> 00:24:22.710
he seems only to
fire them occasionally.

261
00:24:23.712 --> 00:24:27.631
When was the
last shipment?

262
00:24:27.716 --> 00:24:29.467
Mr. Bond, this is
impossible. I cannot...

263
00:24:32.179 --> 00:24:34.680
You're quite right.

264
00:24:34.764 --> 00:24:36.724
An inch too low.

265
00:24:42.022 --> 00:24:45.649
I have just completed an
order for immediate delivery.

266
00:24:45.734 --> 00:24:46.817
Who collects them?

267
00:24:46.902 --> 00:24:48.152
I swear
I do not know.

268
00:24:48.236 --> 00:24:49.695
My instructions
are to go the casino.

269
00:24:49.779 --> 00:24:51.822
I am paid
and they vanish.

270
00:25:46.127 --> 00:25:48.462
In a few moments,
ladies and gentlemen,

271
00:25:48.547 --> 00:25:50.047
we will be in
Hong Kong Harbor,

272
00:25:50.131 --> 00:25:52.091
one of the busiest
ports in the world.

273
00:25:52.676 --> 00:25:56.053
May I remind you to have your passports
and landing cards ready

274
00:25:56.137 --> 00:25:58.764
in order to avoid
unnecessary delay.

275
00:26:07.983 --> 00:26:11.527
On our left is the wreckage of the famous
liner, Queen Elizabeth,

276
00:26:11.987 --> 00:26:16.073
which sank here under mysterious
circumstances in 1971.

277
00:26:17.117 --> 00:26:19.827
Ahead, you can
now see Kowloon.

278
00:26:19.911 --> 00:26:22.621
And on your right,
Hong Kong Island.

279
00:26:43.935 --> 00:26:45.060
Taxi!

280
00:26:49.357 --> 00:26:51.066
Follow that Rolls.

281
00:26:56.031 --> 00:26:59.617
Madam, would you be good enough to move
this inverted bedpan?

282
00:26:59.701 --> 00:27:01.952
I'm sorry I'm late, James,
but your signal

283
00:27:02.037 --> 00:27:04.455
from Macau only just
reached the office.

284
00:27:04.539 --> 00:27:06.790
You're a great
help, Goodnight.

285
00:27:06.875 --> 00:27:09.543
Now, get on to the
license bureau and trace that car.

286
00:27:09.628 --> 00:27:11.712
AU603. A green Rolls.

287
00:27:12.547 --> 00:27:14.256
A green Rolls?

288
00:27:14.341 --> 00:27:16.383
A green Rolls-Royce.

289
00:27:17.302 --> 00:27:19.678
There can't be that
many in Hong Kong.

290
00:27:23.642 --> 00:27:24.767
Courtesy cars.

291
00:27:24.851 --> 00:27:28.020
All green Rolls-Royces
belong to the Peninsula Hotel.

292
00:27:28.104 --> 00:27:29.438
You see what
a two-year posting

293
00:27:29.522 --> 00:27:31.690
to Staff Intelligence
does for a girl.

294
00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:34.902
James, it's wonderful
to see you.

295
00:27:36.237 --> 00:27:37.780
Where are you going?

296
00:27:37.864 --> 00:27:39.907
I need some information.

297
00:27:47.957 --> 00:27:50.751
The subject under surveillance is
occupying Room 602.

298
00:27:50.835 --> 00:27:52.294
I'll buy you dinner
tonight, Goodnight.

299
00:27:52.379 --> 00:27:54.797
But first I have a little official
business to attend to.

300
00:27:54.881 --> 00:27:57.508
Yes, I saw the
official business.

301
00:27:57.592 --> 00:28:01.136
Goodnight, would I do
that to you after two years?

302
00:28:01.221 --> 00:28:02.888
Yes, you bloody
well would.

303
00:28:08.436 --> 00:28:10.354
Please.
I can manage.

304
00:28:10.438 --> 00:28:13.190
Oh, you could open
a door for me, though.

305
00:28:19.698 --> 00:28:22.324
I open champagne.
It's a surprise.

306
00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:24.201
Oh, a surprise!

307
00:29:24.846 --> 00:29:26.430
Good afternoon.

308
00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:37.149
A water pistol?

309
00:29:37.233 --> 00:29:38.567
Pass me that robe.

310
00:29:47.911 --> 00:29:49.369
Turn around.

311
00:29:51.831 --> 00:29:54.750
Do you always take
a shower with a pistol?

312
00:29:59.297 --> 00:30:02.216
Put your hands up
and get out of here!

313
00:30:07.555 --> 00:30:08.972
Keep on walking.

314
00:30:09.057 --> 00:30:11.683
But you haven't
answered my question.

315
00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.404
Reception. Can I help you?

316
00:30:24.906 --> 00:30:27.449
This is Miss Anders,
Room 602.

317
00:30:28.243 --> 00:30:29.952
Put those down!

318
00:30:31.246 --> 00:30:33.831
I see why these packets carry
a government warning.

319
00:30:33.915 --> 00:30:35.582
Give me that!

320
00:30:37.293 --> 00:30:40.170
They certainly can
damage your health.

321
00:30:43.967 --> 00:30:45.592
You're hurting my arm.

322
00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:47.761
I'll break it unless you tell me
where those bullets go.

323
00:30:47.887 --> 00:30:49.429
I can't.

324
00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:51.056
Try!

325
00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:52.975
He'll kill me.
Who?

326
00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:57.604
I can't tell you.

327
00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.357
Scaramanga.

328
00:31:04.279 --> 00:31:06.947
You see what you
can do when you try?

329
00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:11.201
You work for him?

330
00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:14.538
I don't work for him.

331
00:31:17.125 --> 00:31:18.917
He's... I'm his...

332
00:31:19.002 --> 00:31:21.044
Oh, so he's
a lover, too.

333
00:31:21.963 --> 00:31:23.755
Only before he kills.

334
00:31:24.299 --> 00:31:25.549
Bullfighters do
the same thing.

335
00:31:25.633 --> 00:31:27.426
Claim it
improves the eye.

336
00:31:28.344 --> 00:31:31.138
His eye is on me.
Where can I find him?

337
00:31:31.764 --> 00:31:35.475
I don't know.

338
00:31:35.977 --> 00:31:37.060
I said where?

339
00:31:37.145 --> 00:31:39.438
I don't know where.
He doesn't tell me everything.

340
00:31:39.522 --> 00:31:42.900
I know he has a date
at the Bottoms Up Club tonight.

341
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:45.652
How will I
recognize him?

342
00:31:45.945 --> 00:31:47.404
Tall, slim and dark.

343
00:31:47.488 --> 00:31:48.947
So is my aunt.

344
00:31:49.032 --> 00:31:51.074
Anything distinctive
about him?

345
00:31:51.159 --> 00:31:53.410
Yes, but how can I...

346
00:31:53.494 --> 00:31:55.746
He's not like other people.
He has three...

347
00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.372
Oh.

348
00:31:57.832 --> 00:32:00.167
Fascinating
anatomical tidbit

349
00:32:00.251 --> 00:32:03.253
but probably the most
useless piece of information I ever heard.

350
00:32:03.338 --> 00:32:06.173
Unless of course
the Bottoms Up is a strip club

351
00:32:06.257 --> 00:32:08.926
and Scaramanga is
performing there.

352
00:32:10.511 --> 00:32:12.596
You'll have
to do better.

353
00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:18.018
He usually wears a white linen suit, black tie,

354
00:32:18.394 --> 00:32:20.395
and jewelry,
all gold.

355
00:32:21.522 --> 00:32:23.273
You're improving.

356
00:32:23.358 --> 00:32:26.151
I don't want you to
twist my arm again.

357
00:32:27.654 --> 00:32:29.613
I don't want to either.

358
00:32:29.989 --> 00:32:32.616
So I'll tell you what
you're going to do, Miss Anders.

359
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:36.453
You're going to take
those golden bullets to Mr. Scaramanga

360
00:32:36.537 --> 00:32:38.121
because if he
doesn't get them,

361
00:32:38.206 --> 00:32:40.290
he may not show up
at the Bottoms Up.

362
00:32:42.585 --> 00:32:44.544
And I want him there.

363
00:32:45.296 --> 00:32:46.713
Why should you trust me?

364
00:32:47.423 --> 00:32:48.590
I don't.

365
00:32:48.675 --> 00:32:50.634
But neither will
Mr. Scaramanga trust you

366
00:32:50.718 --> 00:32:54.137
if he hears about
this interesting little conversation.

367
00:32:54.222 --> 00:32:55.639
Who knows?

368
00:32:55.723 --> 00:32:58.558
He may even use one of those little golden
bullets on you.

369
00:33:00.395 --> 00:33:02.479
And that would
be a pity

370
00:33:02.563 --> 00:33:04.564
because they're
very expensive.

371
00:33:06.567 --> 00:33:08.443
I'll take them to him.

372
00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:11.530
Let's drink to that.

373
00:33:15.326 --> 00:33:16.785
Bottoms up.

374
00:33:26.462 --> 00:33:27.587
Soda or ginger ale?

375
00:33:27.672 --> 00:33:29.256
Ginger ale,
please.

376
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.362
Police! Drop it!
Drop it.

377
00:35:59.282 --> 00:36:01.283
You're under arrest.

378
00:36:07.373 --> 00:36:09.207
Move away from there!

379
00:36:14.422 --> 00:36:16.923
If you take the trouble to examine
that gun,

380
00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:18.466
You'll notice it
hasn't been fired.

381
00:36:18.551 --> 00:36:20.844
Anything you have to
say, you can say at the station.

382
00:36:28.811 --> 00:36:31.813
I'm charging him
under Section 473.

383
00:36:44.911 --> 00:36:46.870
I didn't see
your identity card.

384
00:36:46.954 --> 00:36:48.079
You will.

385
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.849
Here. I thought we were going
to the police station.

386
00:37:07.934 --> 00:37:09.601
Kowloon side.

387
00:38:51.579 --> 00:38:53.413
Kowloon’s over there!

388
00:38:54.665 --> 00:38:57.250
We are going to
the New Territories.

389
00:39:41.295 --> 00:39:43.671
Welcome aboard,
Commander Bond.

390
00:39:48.302 --> 00:39:49.969
This way, sir.

391
00:39:54.934 --> 00:39:57.060
Down the hatchway,
please.

392
00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:04.317
Good evening, sir.

393
00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:07.737
would you follow
me, please?

394
00:40:14.954 --> 00:40:16.871
Hmm. It certainly
gives you a new slant.

395
00:40:16.956 --> 00:40:18.373
What with the
Chinese on one side

396
00:40:18.457 --> 00:40:19.833
and the American
fleet on the other,

397
00:40:19.917 --> 00:40:23.711
down here's the only
place in Hong Kong you can't be bugged.

398
00:40:24.547 --> 00:40:26.673
And, with current real estate prices in
Hong Kong,

399
00:40:26.757 --> 00:40:28.091
quite practical, really.

400
00:40:28.175 --> 00:40:29.801
Any luck?

401
00:40:29.885 --> 00:40:31.845
Chinese fighter
we managed to salvage.

402
00:40:40.729 --> 00:40:42.439
Good evening, 007.

403
00:40:42.857 --> 00:40:45.275
Glad to see you're still with us.

404
00:40:52.491 --> 00:40:54.409
In future, Commander Bond,
if you must

405
00:40:54.493 --> 00:40:56.703
tour the world of
Suzie Wong by night,

406
00:40:57.037 --> 00:40:59.247
kindly inform our man
here, Lieutenant Hip.

407
00:40:59.331 --> 00:41:00.623
Sorry, Commander.

408
00:41:00.708 --> 00:41:02.542
I had to get you away
from the Hong Kong police

409
00:41:02.626 --> 00:41:05.211
but didn't know
how much you knew.

410
00:41:05.713 --> 00:41:09.090
Nothing. But I think
I should report, sir,

411
00:41:09.175 --> 00:41:12.385
that Scaramanga does not
have a contract on me.

412
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:13.595
He couldn’t have
missed me tonight.

413
00:41:13.679 --> 00:41:16.514
Instead he hit some chap
coming out of a club.

414
00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:19.434
I got quite a shock
when I saw who it was.

415
00:41:19.518 --> 00:41:21.561
I should think you did.

416
00:41:22.021 --> 00:41:25.106
Our missing solar
energy expert, Gibson.

417
00:41:25.191 --> 00:41:26.774
Yes, Gibson.

418
00:41:26.859 --> 00:41:30.028
He was prepared to come
back under certain conditions.

419
00:41:30.112 --> 00:41:32.614
That's why I'm out here
with Professor Frazier.

420
00:41:32.698 --> 00:41:35.867
Lieutenant Hip was making
a preliminary contact.

421
00:41:36.577 --> 00:41:40.246
I almost wish that Scaramanga
had a contract on you.

422
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:44.125
Was Gibson cooperative?

423
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:46.044
He wanted to
bargain for immunity.

424
00:41:46.128 --> 00:41:48.671
Suggested another meeting
in Bangkok to discuss terms.

425
00:41:48.756 --> 00:41:49.881
Why Bangkok?

426
00:41:49.965 --> 00:41:52.509
I got the impression
he worked there for Hai Fat.

427
00:41:52.593 --> 00:41:53.760
That name's
come up before.

428
00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:55.178
A multimillionaire.

429
00:41:55.262 --> 00:41:57.305
Head of Hai Fat
Enterprises.

430
00:41:57.389 --> 00:41:59.432
All of them legitimate
as far as we know.

431
00:41:59.517 --> 00:42:02.393
What did Gibson propose bargaining
with, Lieutenant?

432
00:42:02.603 --> 00:42:05.980
A solex. Claimed it
was 95% efficient.

433
00:42:06.065 --> 00:42:09.859
If he developed a solar cell that
efficient, he solved the energy crisis.

434
00:42:09.944 --> 00:42:11.819
So you've told me.

435
00:42:11.904 --> 00:42:13.821
Coal and oil will
soon be depleted.

436
00:42:13.906 --> 00:42:15.657
Uranium's too dangerous.

437
00:42:15.741 --> 00:42:19.536
Geothermal and tidal control too expensive.
I know all that.

438
00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:21.162
Where's the solex now?

439
00:42:21.247 --> 00:42:23.122
Solex agitator, sir.

440
00:42:23.207 --> 00:42:26.918
The essential unit to convert radiation
from the sun into electricity

441
00:42:27.002 --> 00:42:28.670
on an industrial basis.

442
00:42:28.754 --> 00:42:30.296
It's only about
that size.

443
00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:32.715
It won't take me long
to check out Gibson's efficiency claim.

444
00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.717
This is really exciting.

445
00:42:34.802 --> 00:42:36.427
May I see it,
Lieutenant?

446
00:42:37.805 --> 00:42:41.641
He showed it to me at the bar
and replaced it in his pocket.

447
00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:44.269
And after he was shot,

448
00:42:45.646 --> 00:42:47.480
it wasn't there.

449
00:42:47.898 --> 00:42:49.357
I looked.

450
00:42:51.026 --> 00:42:53.403
Gentlemen,
I congratulate you.

451
00:42:53.487 --> 00:42:55.822
Instead of getting our hands
on a perfected solex,

452
00:42:55.906 --> 00:42:59.242
we're left with a useless corpse
and no leads.

453
00:42:59.994 --> 00:43:01.536
One lead, sir.

454
00:43:02.496 --> 00:43:05.748
Assuming Gibson was
killed by Scaramanga,

455
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.960
whoever hired him could
afford a million dollars.

456
00:43:09.044 --> 00:43:10.795
Are you suggesting
Hai Fat?

457
00:43:10.879 --> 00:43:12.797
He could afford it.

458
00:43:12.881 --> 00:43:14.591
Out of petty cash.

459
00:43:15.509 --> 00:43:17.468
A thought has just
occurred to me, sir.

460
00:43:17.553 --> 00:43:19.679
If Hai Fat hired
Scaramanga,

461
00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:23.099
it's highly unlikely
that he met him personally.

462
00:43:23.183 --> 00:43:24.267
Why?

463
00:43:24.351 --> 00:43:25.602
In the event of
anything going wrong,

464
00:43:25.686 --> 00:43:27.770
there's nothing
to connect the two.

465
00:43:27.855 --> 00:43:30.982
And that gives me an idea
as to how to approach him.

466
00:43:31.066 --> 00:43:33.860
Q, I'll need this.

467
00:43:36.864 --> 00:43:38.656
Really, 007!

468
00:43:38.741 --> 00:43:41.367
I admit,
it's a little kinky.

469
00:43:41.452 --> 00:43:43.745
You'll take Miss Goodnight
with you.

470
00:43:45.372 --> 00:43:46.456
Goodnight, sir?

471
00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:48.458
After tonight's
debacle,

472
00:43:48.542 --> 00:43:52.045
an efficient liaison officer
wouldn't come amiss.

473
00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:55.840
Thank you, sir.

474
00:43:55.924 --> 00:43:57.508
You won't get anywhere near Hai Fat.

475
00:43:57.593 --> 00:43:59.218
I have some relatives
in Bangkok.

476
00:43:59.303 --> 00:44:00.970
I have often
passed his place.

477
00:44:01.055 --> 00:44:03.973
He lives in a big house on
a mountainside surrounded by guards.

478
00:44:48.727 --> 00:44:50.186
No way.

479
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:51.813
The place is
crawling with guards.

480
00:44:51.897 --> 00:44:53.439
Have a look.

481
00:44:59.905 --> 00:45:02.699
Hai Fat takes his
privacy very seriously.

482
00:45:02.783 --> 00:45:04.409
I'm sure
He'll see me.

483
00:45:28.976 --> 00:45:32.145
Good morning.
How's the water?

484
00:45:32.229 --> 00:45:34.397
Why don't you
come in and find out?

485
00:45:34.481 --> 00:45:36.899
Sounds very
tempting, Miss...

486
00:45:36.984 --> 00:45:38.359
Chew Mee.

487
00:45:38.444 --> 00:45:39.736
Really?

488
00:45:40.362 --> 00:45:42.155
well, there's only
one small problem.

489
00:45:42.239 --> 00:45:43.865
I have no
swimming trunks.

490
00:45:43.949 --> 00:45:45.616
Neither have I.

491
00:45:47.161 --> 00:45:49.203
What are
you doing here?

492
00:45:51.957 --> 00:45:53.249
Get out.

493
00:45:55.669 --> 00:45:57.253
Immediately.

494
00:45:57.337 --> 00:45:58.921
I will have you...

495
00:46:08.348 --> 00:46:10.892
Please, forgive me,
Mr. Scaramanga.

496
00:46:14.188 --> 00:46:16.022
Excuse me,
Chew Mee.

497
00:46:16.899 --> 00:46:18.024
Bye.

498
00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:22.653
You understand
my surprise.

499
00:46:23.947 --> 00:46:26.115
I thought it
was understood.

500
00:46:27.951 --> 00:46:31.245
We were never to meet,
Mr. Scaramanga.

501
00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:33.581
I always thought your abnormality
was a myth.

502
00:46:33.665 --> 00:46:37.126
There are cults where it is
considered a sign of invulnerability

503
00:46:37.211 --> 00:46:38.586
and great
sexual prowess.

504
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:40.880
I've learned
to live with it.

505
00:46:41.381 --> 00:46:43.049
Why are you here?

506
00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:45.426
Bond. James Bond.

507
00:46:45.511 --> 00:46:47.094
Do I know
the gentleman?

508
00:46:47.179 --> 00:46:49.055
well, he knows you.

509
00:46:49.139 --> 00:46:50.223
Without being
immodest,

510
00:46:50.307 --> 00:46:53.392
there's hardly anyone
in this part of the world who doesn't.

511
00:46:53.477 --> 00:46:56.729
And there are very few people
who haven't heard of Bond.

512
00:46:56.814 --> 00:46:59.941
British Secret Service,
007, licensed to kill.

513
00:47:00.526 --> 00:47:03.069
He's good, even
by my standards.

514
00:47:03.695 --> 00:47:05.154
He was near the
Bottoms Up Club.

515
00:47:05.239 --> 00:47:07.073
A coincidence.

516
00:47:07.157 --> 00:47:09.116
I don't believe in them.

517
00:47:09.576 --> 00:47:12.286
The man's a menace.
He knows something.

518
00:47:12.371 --> 00:47:16.165
Are you suggesting I invest another
million to remove him?

519
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:18.084
That's up to you.

520
00:47:18.168 --> 00:47:20.670
I will give it
some thought.

521
00:47:20.754 --> 00:47:23.214
Since you have
chosen to meet me,

522
00:47:23.298 --> 00:47:25.466
perhaps you will
dine here tonight.

523
00:47:25.551 --> 00:47:26.717
I'll be delighted.

524
00:47:26.802 --> 00:47:28.511
00 then.

525
00:47:28.595 --> 00:47:32.265
Ling Po, see this
gentleman out.

526
00:47:45.863 --> 00:47:48.030
Don't tell me
you saw him.

527
00:47:48.115 --> 00:47:50.366
He even invited me
to dinner.

528
00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:53.327
He must have found me
quite titillating.

529
00:48:11.054 --> 00:48:14.390
In due time, I shall be laid to
rest here

530
00:48:14.474 --> 00:48:16.517
in my mausoleum

531
00:48:16.602 --> 00:48:19.562
after a useful,
happy, long life.

532
00:48:19.646 --> 00:48:24.066
And I do not intend
to allow Mr. Bond to shorten it.

533
00:48:31.533 --> 00:48:33.576
I'll get the car.

534
00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:36.078
Goodnight, you know
I'd much rather have dinner with you.

535
00:48:36.163 --> 00:48:38.623
Oh, I understand, James.
Please hurry back.

536
00:48:38.707 --> 00:48:39.999
I'll ring as
soon as I do.

537
00:48:40.083 --> 00:48:42.084
A midnight snack
might be just the thing.

538
00:48:42.169 --> 00:48:45.087
I'll keep the wine
properly chilled.

539
00:48:45.172 --> 00:48:47.757
And everything
else warm, I trust.

540
00:48:55.724 --> 00:48:57.141
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

541
00:48:57.225 --> 00:48:59.352
"And everything
else warm?"

542
00:49:01.688 --> 00:49:04.982
I hope you don't mind
giving my nieces a lift.

543
00:49:05.067 --> 00:49:06.108
Good evening.

544
00:49:14.034 --> 00:49:16.202
Hai Fat's is
on the way.

545
00:49:23.085 --> 00:49:25.962
I'll drop the girls,
come back here and hang around.

546
00:49:27.506 --> 00:49:29.215
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

547
00:49:39.893 --> 00:49:41.185
The name's Scaramanga.

548
00:49:41.269 --> 00:49:42.895
Mr. Fat is
expecting me.

549
00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:06.919
"Grisly land."

550
00:50:32.612 --> 00:50:34.363
A pleasant evening.

551
00:51:22.245 --> 00:51:23.996
Get him. Come on.

552
00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:36.342
Stop it.

553
00:51:39.012 --> 00:51:40.346
Not here.

554
00:51:42.682 --> 00:51:44.475
This is my home.

555
00:51:45.644 --> 00:51:47.812
Take Mr. Bond to school.

556
00:52:02.828 --> 00:52:04.120
Heaven.

557
00:52:07.374 --> 00:52:09.083
Definitely heaven.

558
00:54:06.743 --> 00:54:08.035
Tashman.

559
00:55:32.746 --> 00:55:33.912
Chula.

560
00:55:37.125 --> 00:55:41.211
Chula!
Chula! Chula!

561
00:55:41.296 --> 00:55:46.091
Chula! Chula! Chula!

562
00:56:02.776 --> 00:56:05.402
Chula!
Chula! Chula!

563
00:56:55.328 --> 00:56:56.620
Are you all right?

564
00:56:56.704 --> 00:56:57.830
How did
you find me?

565
00:56:57.914 --> 00:56:59.498
Hai Fat owns
this place.

566
00:57:08.967 --> 00:57:10.801
Stand back, girls.

567
00:57:24.441 --> 00:57:25.941
Forgot to tell you.

568
00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:30.154
Their father runs
a karate school.

569
00:58:29.422 --> 00:58:30.714
Hang on!

570
00:58:57.784 --> 00:59:01.119
What you might call
a Mexican screw off, gentlemen.

571
00:59:37.949 --> 00:59:40.075
Pretty lady.
100 baht.

572
00:59:40.493 --> 00:59:42.327
No, no.
80 baht.

573
00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:44.496
50 baht, pretty lady.

574
00:59:44.831 --> 00:59:47.291
Real elephant.
50 baht.

575
01:00:01.347 --> 01:00:04.266
Elephant. Bargain,
mister. 100 baht.

576
01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:12.941
Elephant.
Real elephant.

577
01:00:13.818 --> 01:00:15.193
50 baht.

578
01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:22.200
You are very handsome man.
40 baht.

579
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:25.120
For you, mister,
20 baht.

580
01:00:25.204 --> 01:00:27.247
I'll tell you what, sonny,
I'll give you 20,000 baht

581
01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:29.833
if you can make this
heap go any faster.

582
01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:33.462
20,000 baht.

583
01:00:35.923 --> 01:00:37.758
I'm afraid I'll
have to owe you.

584
01:00:37.842 --> 01:00:41.345
Bloody tourist!
20,000 baht!

585
01:00:58.196 --> 01:01:01.782
Goddamn little
brown water hog!

586
01:01:01.866 --> 01:01:04.284
Oh, what's the matter,
J.W., hon.?

587
01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:07.287
You just try that
in my bayou, boy!

588
01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:09.122
I'd haul your ass!

589
01:01:28.893 --> 01:01:30.769
Oh, look, J.W.

590
01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:34.231
I just gotta have me
one of those cute little elephants.

591
01:01:34.315 --> 01:01:35.607
Elephant?

592
01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:38.443
We're Democrats,
Maybelle.

593
01:01:42.782 --> 01:01:47.494
If you got your little pointy heads
out of them pajamas,

594
01:01:47.578 --> 01:01:50.080
you wouldn't be
late for work!

595
01:02:18.609 --> 01:02:20.026
I knew it!

596
01:02:20.903 --> 01:02:23.822
You pointy-heads
has no more idea

597
01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:25.490
of traffic control

598
01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:27.242
than a goony bird!

599
01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:39.629
Get your cotton-picking schnoz out of my pants.
Hear, now?

600
01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:02.861
Boy. You is ugly.

601
01:03:07.033 --> 01:03:08.366
J.W.?

602
01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:11.578
Where are you?

603
01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:42.609
What do they
teach in that school?

604
01:03:42.693 --> 01:03:44.236
Ballet dancing?

605
01:03:47.406 --> 01:03:51.076
I find nothing remotely
amusing about Mr. Bond's escape.

606
01:03:52.286 --> 01:03:53.662
You underestimated him.

607
01:03:53.746 --> 01:03:55.455
Even my influence
doesn't extend

608
01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:57.582
into the British
Secret Service.

609
01:03:57.959 --> 01:03:59.501
I shall lie
low, too.

610
01:03:59.585 --> 01:04:01.628
I don't intend
to jeopardize the project

611
01:04:01.712 --> 01:04:03.630
in which I've invested half
my fortune

612
01:04:03.714 --> 01:04:06.007
when it's ready
to yield billions.

613
01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:07.717
Where will
you hide out?

614
01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:09.886
That does not
concern you.

615
01:04:10.471 --> 01:04:11.972
Take this.

616
01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:14.307
Return it to the plant

617
01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:17.477
and don't leave there
without my permission.

618
01:04:18.563 --> 01:04:20.772
May I remind you
that you work for me.

619
01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:22.732
I took you on as
a junior partner

620
01:04:22.817 --> 01:04:25.527
to be an occasional
convenience, nothing more.

621
01:04:25.611 --> 01:04:29.364
I did not hire you to interfere
in my affairs.

622
01:04:29.448 --> 01:04:31.533
Is that clearly
understood?

623
01:04:31.617 --> 01:04:33.451
Yes. Very clearly.

624
01:04:35.246 --> 01:04:39.374
I now regret having even
considered employing your services.

625
01:04:39.458 --> 01:04:41.543
But that is
beside the point.

626
01:04:41.627 --> 01:04:43.336
Bond doesn't know
you're in Bangkok.

627
01:04:43.421 --> 01:04:46.381
He's never seen you.
But he knows me.

628
01:04:46.465 --> 01:04:48.258
That's the problem.

629
01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:50.343
That's no problem.

630
01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:12.157
What happened?

631
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:15.994
Mr. Fat has
just resigned.

632
01:05:16.495 --> 01:05:18.997
I'm the new chairman
of the board.

633
01:05:20.541 --> 01:05:23.251
He always did
like that mausoleum.

634
01:05:23.336 --> 01:05:24.920
Put him in it.

635
01:05:43.356 --> 01:05:46.149
Sorry about that, darling.
It was Hip.

636
01:05:46.233 --> 01:05:47.275
There's still no
sign of Hai Fat.

637
01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:50.028
Every inquiry gets
a polite Oriental brush-off.

638
01:05:50.863 --> 01:05:52.572
With compliments.

639
01:05:53.824 --> 01:05:55.200
"Phuyuck?"

640
01:05:56.535 --> 01:05:57.911
'74, sir.

641
01:06:03.834 --> 01:06:05.543
I approve.

642
01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:06.878
You do?

643
01:06:07.421 --> 01:06:09.464
Oh, not the wine.

644
01:06:09.548 --> 01:06:10.882
Your frock.

645
01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:12.467
Tight in all
the right places.

646
01:06:12.551 --> 01:06:14.177
Not too many buttons.

647
01:06:15.179 --> 01:06:18.014
Standard uniform
for Southeast Asia.

648
01:06:18.099 --> 01:06:20.433
The buttons are
down the back.

649
01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.477
Designed by Q,
no doubt.

650
01:06:22.561 --> 01:06:25.063
One of them is
a suicide pill, I suppose?

651
01:06:25.147 --> 01:06:28.108
No, but the bottom
one has a homer in it.

652
01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:31.027
How original.

653
01:06:31.696 --> 01:06:32.946
A toast.

654
01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:39.911
To this moment

655
01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.998
and the moment
yet to come.

656
01:06:48.212 --> 01:06:50.839
In our profession,
I'm afraid,

657
01:06:50.923 --> 01:06:53.508
you never can count
on that moment to come.

658
01:06:53.592 --> 01:06:57.512
Who knows where you and I will be
this time next year?

659
01:06:57.596 --> 01:07:00.473
Opposite sides of
the world, most likely.

660
01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:03.101
That's too far apart.

661
01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:06.438
Now, if Hip doesn't
come up with a lead,

662
01:07:07.314 --> 01:07:10.942
there's really nothing very much
for us to do tonight.

663
01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:15.989
Or is there?

664
01:07:17.825 --> 01:07:19.909
Oh, darling,
I'm tempted.

665
01:07:21.245 --> 01:07:25.206
But killing a few hours as one of your
passing fancies

666
01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:27.250
isn't quite my scene.

667
01:08:05.831 --> 01:08:07.207
"Phuyuck."

668
01:08:20.846 --> 01:08:24.265
Ah. Goodnight, what
a pleasant surprise.

669
01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:27.602
My hard-to-get act didn't last
very long, did it?

670
01:08:28.312 --> 01:08:31.022
I was trained to
expect the unexpected,

671
01:08:32.066 --> 01:08:35.985
but they never prepared
me for anything like you in a nightie.

672
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:55.088
James, I thought
this would never happen.

673
01:09:02.763 --> 01:09:04.139
What made you
change your mind?

674
01:09:04.223 --> 01:09:05.682
I'm weak.

675
01:09:08.477 --> 01:09:09.978
Don't move.

676
01:09:27.288 --> 01:09:28.872
Miss Anders.

677
01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:31.875
I didn't recognize you
with your clothes on.

678
01:09:31.959 --> 01:09:34.627
I bribed the bellboy
to let me in.

679
01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:36.588
I've come to warn you.

680
01:09:37.298 --> 01:09:39.090
You're in
great danger.

681
01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:40.341
I usually am.

682
01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:43.428
That's why I use the
old three-pillow trick.

683
01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:47.432
Please believe me. I'm risking my life
to come here.

684
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:51.519
well, your concern
for my well-being is touching

685
01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:53.313
but puzzles me.

686
01:09:54.106 --> 01:09:56.024
Scaramanga is
in Bangkok.

687
01:09:56.108 --> 01:09:57.901
He was in Hong Kong, too,
but not after me.

688
01:09:57.985 --> 01:10:00.361
We've been through
that routine.

689
01:10:03.073 --> 01:10:05.408
He's a monster.
I hate him.

690
01:10:05.492 --> 01:10:07.118
Then leave him.

691
01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:10.663
You don't walk
out on Scaramanga.

692
01:10:11.498 --> 01:10:13.917
There's no place
he wouldn't find me.

693
01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:15.960
You need a good lawyer.

694
01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:18.338
I need 007.

695
01:10:19.298 --> 01:10:20.381
Who do you think
sent that bullet

696
01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:22.508
to London with
your number on it?

697
01:10:24.261 --> 01:10:25.470
I did.

698
01:10:28.515 --> 01:10:32.018
And it wasn't easy getting his fingerprint
on the note.

699
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:38.191
You'll forgive me if I've been a little
slow on the uptake.

700
01:10:38.275 --> 01:10:41.319
Don't you see you're the only man
in the world who can kill him?

701
01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:44.656
What gives you
that idea?

702
01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:48.284
The way Scaramanga
speaks about you.

703
01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:50.578
Even has a
likeness of you.

704
01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:52.121
I'm flattered.

705
01:10:54.833 --> 01:10:56.501
I want him dead.

706
01:10:59.838 --> 01:11:02.757
Name your price.
Anything. I'll pay it.

707
01:11:05.844 --> 01:11:08.304
You can have me, too,
if you like.

708
01:11:09.556 --> 01:11:11.933
I'm not unattractive.

709
01:11:12.017 --> 01:11:15.061
At last you're starting
to tell the truth.

710
01:11:19.608 --> 01:11:22.360
I've dreamed about you
setting me free.

711
01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:32.328
I've been dreaming
about a solex agitator.

712
01:11:38.168 --> 01:11:39.836
Ever heard of one?

713
01:11:44.174 --> 01:11:46.426
Perhaps you can
have that, too.

714
01:12:01.734 --> 01:12:03.901
No, my clothes
are in there.

715
01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:07.697
I'll kill that woman.
Later.

716
01:12:27.468 --> 01:12:28.760
Charming.

717
01:12:47.154 --> 01:12:50.031
It was an inspiration
sending that bullet.

718
01:13:32.449 --> 01:13:33.908
You're late.

719
01:13:34.993 --> 01:13:36.994
It was a
double feature.

720
01:13:40.499 --> 01:13:42.333
What are you doing?

721
01:13:43.001 --> 01:13:45.002
Putting my
jewelry away.

722
01:14:01.186 --> 01:14:03.271
You can come
out now.

723
01:14:03.355 --> 01:14:04.605
What time is it?

724
01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:06.107
00-ish.

725
01:14:06.191 --> 01:14:07.316
00?

726
01:14:08.026 --> 01:14:10.236
Do you mean I've been
in here for two hours?

727
01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.280
All in the
line of duty.

728
01:14:12.364 --> 01:14:15.283
Duty? I'm resigning
in the morning.

729
01:14:15.367 --> 01:14:17.452
Oh, Goodnight, come on,
don't let us down.

730
01:14:17.536 --> 01:14:18.953
The Service needs
women like you.

731
01:14:19.037 --> 01:14:21.247
well, obviously you don't.

732
01:14:23.834 --> 01:14:25.793
Forgive me, darling.

733
01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:28.045
Your turn will come,
I promise.

734
01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:30.506
As soon as she
brings me that solex.

735
01:14:30.591 --> 01:14:32.341
For killing Scaramanga?

736
01:14:32.426 --> 01:14:35.219
If she gets me
the solex agitator first.

737
01:14:35.929 --> 01:14:37.221
First?

738
01:14:38.056 --> 01:14:40.683
James,
you must be good.

739
01:14:43.395 --> 01:14:44.520
Hmm.

740
01:14:44.688 --> 01:14:48.191
We'll find out about that the next time
I meet her.

741
01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:52.278
She's making
the arrangements.

742
01:15:32.778 --> 01:15:33.945
Sorry I'm late.

743
01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:36.906
Bangkok traffic's
worse than Piccadilly.

744
01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:38.741
He's made contact.

745
01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:41.494
How's the charm
boy doing?

746
01:15:41.578 --> 01:15:43.037
Need you ask?

747
01:15:43.121 --> 01:15:44.914
Meet you outside.

748
01:15:48.168 --> 01:15:50.044
Did you bring it?

749
01:16:19.366 --> 01:16:21.701
Darling, I left it
in your handbag.

750
01:16:21.785 --> 01:16:23.077
It must be in
here somewhere, dear.

751
01:16:23.161 --> 01:16:24.829
I saw the man in
the shop give it to you.

752
01:16:25.539 --> 01:16:28.416
Without the ticket, we can't get a receipt
for customs.

753
01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:31.919
You won't find it in there, Mr. Bond.
I looked before you came.

754
01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:33.254
I wouldn't do
that either.

755
01:16:33.338 --> 01:16:34.505
Look behind you.

756
01:16:36.675 --> 01:16:38.009
Lower.

757
01:16:40.804 --> 01:16:42.972
A gun and a bag of peanuts.
How original.

758
01:16:43.056 --> 01:16:44.473
What will they
think of next?

759
01:16:47.728 --> 01:16:49.812
My name is Scaramanga.

760
01:16:49.896 --> 01:16:51.606
Francisco Scaramanga.

761
01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:52.898
I feel I know you,

762
01:16:52.983 --> 01:16:55.443
although I never thought we should
ever really meet.

763
01:16:55.527 --> 01:16:57.361
It's a very great
pleasure for me, Mr. Bond,

764
01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:59.238
thanks to Miss Anders.

765
01:16:59.948 --> 01:17:02.450
You've a strange
way of showing your gratitude.

766
01:17:02.534 --> 01:17:05.077
A mistress cannot
serve two masters.

767
01:17:06.371 --> 01:17:09.040
A difficult shot,
but most gratifying.

768
01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:13.461
well, we all get our jollies one way
or another.

769
01:17:13.545 --> 01:17:16.339
Mine have always
been guns, Mr. Bond.

770
01:17:16.423 --> 01:17:19.592
When I was a boy, I was brought up
in a circus.

771
01:17:19.676 --> 01:17:23.596
My only real friend was a magnificent
African bull elephant.

772
01:17:24.723 --> 01:17:28.392
One day his handler mistreated him and
he went berserk.

773
01:17:30.228 --> 01:17:33.648
Bleeding, dying,

774
01:17:33.732 --> 01:17:35.358
he came and found me.

775
01:17:37.527 --> 01:17:39.904
Stood on one leg,
his best trick,

776
01:17:40.447 --> 01:17:42.406
picked me up and
put me on his back.

777
01:17:46.203 --> 01:17:48.829
The man emptied
the gun into his eye.

778
01:17:50.707 --> 01:17:52.958
I emptied my stage pistol
into his.

779
01:17:53.043 --> 01:17:54.919
An eye for an eye.

780
01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:56.170
Nut?

781
01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:04.679
You see, Mr. Bond, I always thought
I liked animals

782
01:18:04.763 --> 01:18:07.556
and I discovered that
I liked killing people even more.

783
01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:18.943
Keep this. Whatever
you do, don't lose it.

784
01:18:20.487 --> 01:18:21.946
I have to get
back to help James.

785
01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:23.072
Something's gone wrong?

786
01:18:23.156 --> 01:18:24.490
There's a midget
with a gun on him.

787
01:18:24.574 --> 01:18:26.158
A midget?

788
01:18:26.243 --> 01:18:27.743
Same one I saw
outside the Bottoms Up.

789
01:18:27.828 --> 01:18:29.995
And the girl is dead.
Call the police.

790
01:18:37.337 --> 01:18:39.547
Forget the girl.
She's replaceable.

791
01:18:39.631 --> 01:18:42.383
I shall find what
she stole from me.

792
01:18:42.467 --> 01:18:44.385
Personally, I've got nothing against you,
Mr. Bond,

793
01:18:44.469 --> 01:18:47.221
so let us hope our
paths never cross again.

794
01:18:47.305 --> 01:18:49.140
Please don't
try to follow me.

795
01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:52.435
Your peanut-toting friend back there
wouldn't like it.

796
01:18:52.519 --> 01:18:54.228
No, he wouldn't.

797
01:19:06.241 --> 01:19:08.409
You want to try
one of mine?

798
01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:20.755
Where's the solex?
I gave it to Goodnight.

799
01:19:20.839 --> 01:19:22.631
And where's Goodnight?
Outside.

800
01:19:58.043 --> 01:20:00.044
She must be
by the car.

801
01:20:28.782 --> 01:20:30.616
Women. Walkie-talkie.

802
01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.164
Goodnight,
where are you?

803
01:20:37.249 --> 01:20:38.999
Somebody locked me
in a boot.

804
01:20:39.084 --> 01:20:40.167
In a what?

805
01:20:40.252 --> 01:20:43.295
The midget's car.
I'm locked in.

806
01:20:44.214 --> 01:20:48.634
It's a bronze car with a black roof,
number 7543.

807
01:20:54.432 --> 01:20:56.517
The keys.
I haven't got them.

808
01:20:56.601 --> 01:20:57.935
Oh, no.

809
01:20:59.104 --> 01:21:01.897
Goodnight, where
are the car keys?

810
01:21:01.982 --> 01:21:05.776
I've got the keys.
And I've got the solex, too.

811
01:21:08.154 --> 01:21:09.530
Taxi!

812
01:21:09.614 --> 01:21:11.949
Stay in there, Goodnight.
We've got you spotted.

813
01:21:20.834 --> 01:21:23.294
Taxi! Taxi!

814
01:21:37.475 --> 01:21:39.018
How about a
demonstration, boy?

815
01:21:39.102 --> 01:21:40.394
Certainly, sir.

816
01:21:49.237 --> 01:21:52.239
What the hell
is going on?

817
01:21:57.621 --> 01:22:01.206
Now I know you!

818
01:22:01.666 --> 01:22:02.958
Oh, no.

819
01:22:03.043 --> 01:22:05.002
You're that secret agent.

820
01:22:05.086 --> 01:22:07.421
That English secret
agent from England.

821
01:22:18.516 --> 01:22:20.976
You're chasing somebody.

822
01:22:21.061 --> 01:22:23.729
Who you after this
time, boy? Commies?

823
01:22:23.813 --> 01:22:24.980
Let's go get them.

824
01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:26.774
I'm with you
all the way.

825
01:22:34.658 --> 01:22:36.992
Uh-oh! I think
we've got trouble.

826
01:22:56.054 --> 01:22:59.890
Pull your cars over,
you little brown pointy-heads!

827
01:23:00.392 --> 01:23:02.351
I'm a peace officer!

828
01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:07.314
- James, are you still there?
- James?

829
01:23:08.233 --> 01:23:10.484
Can you hear me? James!

830
01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:12.528
All right, Goodnight.
Don't panic.

831
01:23:12.612 --> 01:23:14.446
Who's that?
It's...

832
01:23:16.366 --> 01:23:18.742
It's headquarters.
Let me talk to them.

833
01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:22.579
Hello. This is Sheriff J.W. Pepper,
Louisiana State Police.

834
01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:25.582
Now, you call my
wife at the Narai Hotel

835
01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:28.252
and tell her
I'm on a mission.

836
01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:30.254
I've been deputized.

837
01:23:30.338 --> 01:23:32.089
Right?
Right.

838
01:23:33.299 --> 01:23:35.175
Which car are we
all chasing, boy?

839
01:24:46.664 --> 01:24:48.665
Move it! Move it!

840
01:24:49.876 --> 01:24:51.752
Get that piece of
junk off the road!

841
01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:22.449
They went to
the left, boy.

842
01:25:31.376 --> 01:25:33.544
Press that pedal, boy.

843
01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.936
Where the hell
they got to?

844
01:26:04.909 --> 01:26:06.785
You goofed, boy.

845
01:26:18.923 --> 01:26:21.633
Nearest bridge
is two miles back.

846
01:26:30.602 --> 01:26:32.686
God damn! What the...

847
01:26:33.646 --> 01:26:37.107
What's going on?
What the hell you doing now, boy?

848
01:26:39.444 --> 01:26:41.695
The bridge is that way!

849
01:26:45.783 --> 01:26:47.659
You're not thinking of...

850
01:26:47.744 --> 01:26:49.536
I sure am, boy.

851
01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:53.373
Ever heard of
Evel Knievel?

852
01:27:08.556 --> 01:27:10.891
I never done
that before!

853
01:27:10.975 --> 01:27:12.768
well, neither
have I, actually.

854
01:28:09.367 --> 01:28:11.368
Let's go get
them, boy!

855
01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:52.075
You stay put, boy.
This is my department.

856
01:28:54.579 --> 01:28:57.372
Glad to see you
boys are on the ball.

857
01:28:57.457 --> 01:29:00.709
Sheriff J.W. Pepper,
Louisiana State Police.

858
01:29:00.793 --> 01:29:02.419
Here's my
identification.

859
01:29:02.503 --> 01:29:05.881
This is the Law Enforcement Association,
American Legion.

860
01:29:05.965 --> 01:29:09.301
Me and my partner here,
we're on a secret mission.

861
01:29:09.385 --> 01:29:10.802
Hey! What the hell
you doing?

862
01:29:10.887 --> 01:29:12.679
Hey! Give me
my wallet back.

863
01:29:32.784 --> 01:29:34.034
Doors.

864
01:30:04.982 --> 01:30:06.608
You can't
do this to me!

865
01:30:06.692 --> 01:30:08.235
I want my
wallet back!

866
01:30:08.319 --> 01:30:10.362
Take these goddamn
bracelets off!

867
01:30:10.446 --> 01:30:13.657
I'm gonna sue ya for false arrest,
police brutality!

868
01:30:13.741 --> 01:30:18.078
I got connections!
I'm gonna get the FBI on your ass, the CIA.

869
01:30:18.162 --> 01:30:21.289
God damn it, I'm gonna get
Henry Kissinger!

870
01:30:22.041 --> 01:30:24.960
Look at me when I'm
talking to ya, boy!

871
01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:32.384
What's the matter?

872
01:30:32.468 --> 01:30:35.512
Ain't none of you pointy-heads ever
seen an airplane before?

873
01:30:38.349 --> 01:30:41.351
James? James,
are you still there?

874
01:30:42.186 --> 01:30:45.564
Can you hear me?
I think we've stopped.

875
01:31:06.794 --> 01:31:09.629
That is really all
there is to report, sir.

876
01:31:11.048 --> 01:31:14.301
So, if I heard correctly,
Scaramanga got away.

877
01:31:14.385 --> 01:31:15.510
Yes, sir.

878
01:31:15.595 --> 01:31:17.554
In a car that
sprouted wings.

879
01:31:17.638 --> 01:31:19.431
That's perfectly
feasible, sir.

880
01:31:19.515 --> 01:31:21.057
As a matter of fact,
we're working on one now.

881
01:31:21.142 --> 01:31:22.851
Oh, Q, shut up.

882
01:31:23.728 --> 01:31:25.645
And Miss Goodnight
was in the boot. Yes, sir.

883
01:31:25.730 --> 01:31:27.397
We found the
car-plane abandoned

884
01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:30.066
about 200 miles
west of Bangkok.

885
01:31:30.193 --> 01:31:32.986
And the solex?
In Goodnight's handbag, sir.

886
01:31:33.738 --> 01:31:34.946
Where is
Goodnight now?

887
01:31:35.031 --> 01:31:36.531
We don't know, sir.

888
01:31:36.616 --> 01:31:38.658
Communications aren't
picking up the signal

889
01:31:38.743 --> 01:31:40.744
from the homer she
has, supplied by Q.

890
01:31:40.828 --> 01:31:43.079
Rubbish! They're
simply not stepping up

891
01:31:43.164 --> 01:31:45.165
the reception
sufficiently to enable...

892
01:31:45.249 --> 01:31:46.833
Oh, shut up, Q.

893
01:31:47.293 --> 01:31:50.128
Of all the fouled-up,
half-witted operations.

894
01:31:51.506 --> 01:31:52.506
What do you want?

895
01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:54.508
We've picked up
Goodnight's signal, sir.

896
01:31:54.884 --> 01:31:55.884
well, that's
something.

897
01:31:55.968 --> 01:31:58.595
But there is something
rather curious, sir.

898
01:32:00.723 --> 01:32:02.557
Our sector's here

899
01:32:02.642 --> 01:32:05.477
and we're receiving
her signal from somewhere

900
01:32:05.561 --> 01:32:07.812
off this coastline
off shore here.

901
01:32:07.897 --> 01:32:10.899
Now, here it is on
a much larger scale.

902
01:32:11.526 --> 01:32:12.651
That's where she is.

903
01:32:12.735 --> 01:32:14.569
In this group
of small islands.

904
01:32:14.654 --> 01:32:17.405
That's all we need,
Red Chinese waters.

905
01:32:17.490 --> 01:32:20.742
well, we could stray
inadvertently into them, sir.

906
01:32:20.826 --> 01:32:22.702
I could fly low
under their radar screen.

907
01:32:22.787 --> 01:32:25.080
Absolutely out
of the question.

908
01:32:25.623 --> 01:32:27.457
If the PM gets
to hear of this,

909
01:32:27.542 --> 01:32:29.626
He'll hang me
from the yardarm.

910
01:32:29.961 --> 01:32:33.296
Officially, you won't know a thing
about it, sir.

911
01:33:50.958 --> 01:33:54.294
There's a small seaplane
approaching your island.

912
01:33:54.378 --> 01:33:56.463
Do you want us to
take any action?

913
01:33:56.547 --> 01:33:59.132
No. No, please
don't do anything.

914
01:34:01.636 --> 01:34:04.512
Yes, it's a guest
I'm expecting.

915
01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:09.267
No, he won't
be leaving.

916
01:35:31.809 --> 01:35:33.518
I am Nick Nack.

917
01:35:39.233 --> 01:35:41.317
I prefer the '62 myself.

918
01:35:41.777 --> 01:35:43.987
Still, beats a
bag of peanuts.

919
01:35:44.071 --> 01:35:47.240
Monsieur Scaramanga
will welcome you personally.

920
01:35:52.371 --> 01:35:54.038
Forgive me,
Mr. Bond.

921
01:35:54.123 --> 01:35:57.292
A vulgar display,
but I couldn’t resist it

922
01:35:57.376 --> 01:36:00.295
because I am so
delighted to see you again.

923
01:36:00.713 --> 01:36:02.380
A harmless toy.

924
01:36:04.175 --> 01:36:07.302
I am, as you can see now,
completely unarmed.

925
01:36:08.345 --> 01:36:09.721
Cigarette?

926
01:36:10.181 --> 01:36:11.765
We have so much
in common, Mr. Bond.

927
01:36:11.849 --> 01:36:13.099
We have so much
to discuss,

928
01:36:13.184 --> 01:36:15.477
and we will never have this
opportunity again.

929
01:36:15.561 --> 01:36:17.270
Ours is the
loneliest profession,

930
01:36:17.354 --> 01:36:20.690
so let us spend a few pleasant
hours together.

931
01:36:20.775 --> 01:36:23.359
How can I refuse such
a gracious invitation?

932
01:36:23.444 --> 01:36:25.195
Splendid.
Splendid!

933
01:36:25.905 --> 01:36:28.990
Nick Nack, I expect you to
surpass yourself.

934
01:36:29.074 --> 01:36:30.533
He's a Cordon Bleu,
you know.

935
01:36:30.618 --> 01:36:32.869
By the way, where's
Miss Goodnight?

936
01:36:34.872 --> 01:36:37.207
Oh, she's around
here somewhere.

937
01:36:37.291 --> 01:36:38.458
There's no way
for her to leave,

938
01:36:38.542 --> 01:36:40.335
so she does
as she pleases.

939
01:36:40.419 --> 01:36:42.462
How do you
like my island?

940
01:36:42.546 --> 01:36:44.380
A bit off the beaten track,
isn't it?

941
01:36:44.465 --> 01:36:48.092
It's rent-free. I do my landlords
an occasional favor.

942
01:36:48.177 --> 01:36:49.928
A cozy arrangement.

943
01:36:50.387 --> 01:36:51.763
Servant problem,
I suppose.

944
01:36:51.847 --> 01:36:53.348
Not at all.

945
01:36:53.432 --> 01:36:56.017
Nick Nack does
for me very nicely.

946
01:36:58.395 --> 01:36:59.813
Usually there's just
the two of us,

947
01:36:59.897 --> 01:37:01.397
but having guests
is no inconvenience.

948
01:37:01.482 --> 01:37:02.816
We're entirely
self-supporting.

949
01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:04.567
We have every electrical
laborsaving device

950
01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:06.569
you could
possibly think of.

951
01:37:06.904 --> 01:37:10.156
This is an air lock,
as you are doubtless aware.

952
01:37:12.701 --> 01:37:14.536
Automatic,
of course.

953
01:37:16.288 --> 01:37:19.874
Naturally, we have an ample supply of
electricity here.

954
01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:23.086
Let me show you.

955
01:37:38.978 --> 01:37:41.729
This should run
a few electric toothbrushes.

956
01:37:41.814 --> 01:37:43.147
Up here.

957
01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:50.154
A solar
energy station.

958
01:37:50.239 --> 01:37:51.990
So this is what
it's all about.

959
01:37:52.783 --> 01:37:54.868
Thermoelectric
generators to convert

960
01:37:54.952 --> 01:37:56.995
solar energy
into electricity.

961
01:37:57.955 --> 01:38:00.748
All built by Hai Fat's
construction company, no doubt.

962
01:38:00.833 --> 01:38:03.418
Somehow I seem to have
inherited it from him.

963
01:38:03.502 --> 01:38:05.295
It's all fully automated.

964
01:38:05.379 --> 01:38:06.963
That's Kra, maintenance
and security.

965
01:38:07.047 --> 01:38:08.339
He looks after
everything in here.

966
01:38:08.424 --> 01:38:11.009
Nick Nack does everything else
when he isn't polishing the silver.

967
01:38:11.093 --> 01:38:15.054
They tell me the electricity is stored
in here somewhere.

968
01:38:15.139 --> 01:38:17.807
Science was never
my strong point.

969
01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:22.770
Superconductivity coils
cooled by liquid helium.

970
01:38:23.689 --> 01:38:26.441
If I were you,
I wouldn't stick my finger,

971
01:38:26.525 --> 01:38:29.068
or anything else for
that matter, in there.

972
01:38:29.153 --> 01:38:31.446
At 453 degrees
below zero,

973
01:38:31.530 --> 01:38:34.240
that liquid helium would break it off
like an icicle.

974
01:38:34.325 --> 01:38:37.076
You really know far more about it than
I do, Mr. Bond.

975
01:38:37.161 --> 01:38:39.537
I'm arranging for every country that
can afford the price

976
01:38:39.622 --> 01:38:41.998
to send their experts here
to see for themselves.

977
01:38:42.082 --> 01:38:45.501
But no solex until the money is in
the bank. Right?

978
01:38:46.170 --> 01:38:47.170
Right.

979
01:38:47.254 --> 01:38:49.839
I have run across
similar situations.

980
01:38:49.924 --> 01:38:51.674
Not what I've got here.

981
01:38:51.759 --> 01:38:53.635
This way the highest
bidder can build

982
01:38:53.719 --> 01:38:54.928
hundreds of
these stations

983
01:38:55.012 --> 01:38:57.847
and sell franchises
for hundreds more.

984
01:38:58.891 --> 01:39:02.268
He will literally have the sun in
his pocket.

985
01:39:02.353 --> 01:39:04.437
A monopoly on
solar power.

986
01:39:05.814 --> 01:39:09.150
The oil sheiks will pay you just to
keep solar energy off the market.

987
01:39:09.234 --> 01:39:11.694
The thought had
occurred to me.

988
01:39:16.450 --> 01:39:18.826
This is the
collection point.

989
01:39:32.174 --> 01:39:35.718
Ah. So that's
where it belongs.

990
01:39:35.803 --> 01:39:37.762
Our famous solex in
the still down there

991
01:39:37.846 --> 01:39:40.223
transmits heat to
the thermal generators.

992
01:39:43.519 --> 01:39:45.728
It's collected
through this?

993
01:39:49.441 --> 01:39:51.067
But where is it
collected from?

994
01:39:51.151 --> 01:39:52.735
You need the sun.

995
01:40:02.329 --> 01:40:04.747
Watch that
mushroom-shaped rock.

996
01:40:27.146 --> 01:40:28.604
Ingenious, isn't it?

997
01:40:28.689 --> 01:40:32.025
The panels lock on to the sun
and then track it automatically.

998
01:40:32.109 --> 01:40:34.318
Something like
that, yes.

999
01:40:41.326 --> 01:40:42.410
Ah.

1000
01:40:42.494 --> 01:40:45.329
Reflected through this,
those panels must produce a heat

1001
01:40:45.414 --> 01:40:47.373
of at least 3,500
degrees Fahrenheit.

1002
01:40:47.458 --> 01:40:49.292
If you say so, Mr. Bond.

1003
01:40:53.005 --> 01:40:55.590
But I do know that we can focus the power
wherever we want.

1004
01:40:55.674 --> 01:40:57.675
Over here.
I'll show you.

1005
01:41:00.137 --> 01:41:01.804
This is a bonus.

1006
01:41:04.475 --> 01:41:07.143
Goes with the solex.
No extra charge.

1007
01:41:28.791 --> 01:41:31.125
This is the part
I really like.

1008
01:41:41.011 --> 01:41:43.638
Now, that's what
I call solar power.

1009
01:41:44.932 --> 01:41:47.266
That's what
I call trouble.

1010
01:41:48.811 --> 01:41:51.354
You must admit, Mr. Bond,
I am now undeniably

1011
01:41:51.438 --> 01:41:53.106
the Man with
the golden Gun.

1012
01:41:58.153 --> 01:42:00.613
Ah. Lunch.

1013
01:42:17.923 --> 01:42:19.715
This way, Mr. Bond.

1014
01:42:21.135 --> 01:42:23.052
Ah! Miss Goodnight.

1015
01:42:23.804 --> 01:42:24.887
James!

1016
01:42:24.972 --> 01:42:26.889
Aren't we a little
overdressed, Goodnight?

1017
01:42:26.974 --> 01:42:28.724
I like a girl
in a bikini.

1018
01:42:28.809 --> 01:42:30.476
No concealed weapons.

1019
01:42:30.561 --> 01:42:33.229
Miss Goodnight,
please. Mr. Bond.

1020
01:42:34.773 --> 01:42:37.608
Now let's see what
Nick Nack has for us.

1021
01:42:37.693 --> 01:42:39.610
Ah. Mushrooms.

1022
01:42:43.574 --> 01:42:46.409
The fried mushroom
looks terribly interesting.

1023
01:42:46.493 --> 01:42:49.787
Yes, I noticed that.
I'll get around to it later.

1024
01:42:53.250 --> 01:42:55.001
Having fun in
the sun, Goodnight?

1025
01:42:55.085 --> 01:42:56.586
Yes.

1026
01:42:57.254 --> 01:42:59.380
I could stay
here forever.

1027
01:43:01.425 --> 01:43:03.176
Hmm!

1028
01:43:03.427 --> 01:43:04.468
Excellent.

1029
01:43:04.553 --> 01:43:07.263
Slightly reminiscent
of a '34 Mouton.

1030
01:43:07.347 --> 01:43:09.724
Then I must add
it to my cellar.

1031
01:43:11.310 --> 01:43:13.603
You live well,
Scaramanga.

1032
01:43:14.188 --> 01:43:17.940
At a million dollars
a contract, I can afford to, Mr. Bond.

1033
01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:19.859
You work for peanuts.

1034
01:43:19.943 --> 01:43:22.195
A hearty "well done"
from Her Majesty the Queen

1035
01:43:22.279 --> 01:43:23.696
and a pittance
of a pension.

1036
01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:25.865
Apart from that,
we are the same.

1037
01:43:27.576 --> 01:43:29.702
To us, Mr. Bond.

1038
01:43:29.786 --> 01:43:31.537
We are the best.

1039
01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:35.249
There's a useful
four-letter word,

1040
01:43:35.334 --> 01:43:36.792
and you're
full of it.

1041
01:43:39.922 --> 01:43:43.049
When I kill, it's on the specific orders
of my government.

1042
01:43:43.133 --> 01:43:46.052
And those I kill are
themselves killers.

1043
01:43:46.136 --> 01:43:47.845
Oh, come, come,
Mr. Bond.

1044
01:43:47.930 --> 01:43:49.055
You disappoint me.

1045
01:43:49.139 --> 01:43:51.140
You get as much
fulfillment out of killing as I do,

1046
01:43:51.225 --> 01:43:52.475
so why don't
you admit it?

1047
01:43:52.559 --> 01:43:55.019
I admit killing you
would be a pleasure.

1048
01:43:55.103 --> 01:43:56.896
You should’ve done that
when you first saw me.

1049
01:43:56.980 --> 01:43:58.397
But then of course
the English don't consider it

1050
01:43:58.482 --> 01:44:01.400
sporting to kill in
cold blood, do they?

1051
01:44:01.735 --> 01:44:03.778
Don't count on that.

1052
01:44:14.831 --> 01:44:16.624
I could’ve shot you
down when you landed

1053
01:44:16.708 --> 01:44:19.126
but that would've
been ridiculously easy.

1054
01:44:23.048 --> 01:44:26.717
You see, Mr. Bond,
like every great artist,

1055
01:44:26.802 --> 01:44:28.928
I want to create
an indisputable

1056
01:44:29.012 --> 01:44:31.347
masterpiece once
in my lifetime.

1057
01:44:32.599 --> 01:44:34.600
The death of 007,

1058
01:44:36.812 --> 01:44:38.354
face to face,

1059
01:44:38.772 --> 01:44:40.356
will be mine.

1060
01:44:41.233 --> 01:44:45.444
You mean, stuffed and displayed over
your rocky mantelpiece?

1061
01:44:45.529 --> 01:44:49.448
That's an amusing idea, but
I was thinking in terms of history.

1062
01:44:49.533 --> 01:44:51.701
A duel between titans.

1063
01:44:52.494 --> 01:44:55.454
My golden gun
against your Walther PPK.

1064
01:44:55.956 --> 01:44:58.624
Each of us with
a 50-50 chance.

1065
01:44:58.709 --> 01:45:01.127
Six bullets
to your one?

1066
01:45:01.211 --> 01:45:02.878
I only need one.

1067
01:45:05.882 --> 01:45:08.050
Sounds a bit old-fashioned,
doesn't it?

1068
01:45:08.135 --> 01:45:11.137
I mean, pistols at dawn,
that sort of thing.

1069
01:45:11.221 --> 01:45:13.222
Indeed, it is,
Mr. Bond,

1070
01:45:13.890 --> 01:45:17.393
but it still remains the only
true test for gentlemen.

1071
01:45:17.936 --> 01:45:20.604
I doubt if you qualify
on that score.

1072
01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:24.859
However, I accept.

1073
01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:28.654
As soon as I finish
this delicious lunch

1074
01:45:28.739 --> 01:45:30.906
that Nick Nack
has prepared for us.

1075
01:45:31.908 --> 01:45:36.287
Messieurs, I will remind you
this is un duel à la mort.

1076
01:45:37.497 --> 01:45:40.708
Only one of you can leave
the field of honor.

1077
01:45:41.501 --> 01:45:43.919
If a coup de grâce
is necessary,

1078
01:45:44.755 --> 01:45:48.299
as your referee,
I will administer it myself.

1079
01:45:49.843 --> 01:45:53.596
I do not expect wounds.
Only a clean kill.

1080
01:45:55.098 --> 01:45:56.599
On my command

1081
01:45:57.100 --> 01:46:00.227
each contestant
will take 20 paces.

1082
01:46:01.188 --> 01:46:03.814
Are you ready,
Monsieur Scaramanga?

1083
01:46:06.443 --> 01:46:07.401
Ready.

1084
01:46:07.486 --> 01:46:09.111
Are you ready,
Monsieur Bond?

1085
01:46:09.905 --> 01:46:11.155
Ready.

1086
01:46:11.239 --> 01:46:13.366
I will now
begin the count.

1087
01:46:14.618 --> 01:46:19.914
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

1088
01:46:20.624 --> 01:46:24.627
6, 7, 8, 9,

1089
01:46:25.295 --> 01:46:29.382
10, 11, 12, 13,

1090
01:46:29.841 --> 01:46:32.802
14, 15, 16,

1091
01:46:33.303 --> 01:46:37.640
17, 18, 19, 20!

1092
01:47:20.517 --> 01:47:22.309
If you kill him,

1093
01:47:23.395 --> 01:47:25.062
all this be mine.

1094
01:47:27.691 --> 01:47:29.692
This way, Monsieur Bond.

1095
01:48:07.689 --> 01:48:09.690
Monsieur,
good shooting.

1096
01:48:10.525 --> 01:48:12.818
I've never killed
a midget before,

1097
01:48:12.903 --> 01:48:14.737
but there can always be a first time.

1098
01:48:15.405 --> 01:48:16.655
Oh, monsieur.

1099
01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:17.740


1100
01:49:32.649 --> 01:49:35.609
You only
have three bullets left!

1101
01:49:50.333 --> 01:49:52.001
I fooled you.

1102
01:53:13.995 --> 01:53:15.704
Goodnight.
James!

1103
01:53:17.248 --> 01:53:18.415
James.

1104
01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:19.958
Steady,
Goodnight.

1105
01:53:20.585 --> 01:53:22.085
Where is he?

1106
01:53:22.879 --> 01:53:25.047
Flat on his
coup de grâce.

1107
01:53:25.131 --> 01:53:28.258
Come on. Let's get out of this
fun palace and find that solex.

1108
01:53:38.478 --> 01:53:39.770
Wait here.

1109
01:53:39.854 --> 01:53:41.396
I'll take care of
the maintenance man.

1110
01:53:41.481 --> 01:53:43.398
I already did.

1111
01:53:43.483 --> 01:53:45.317
I laid him out cold.

1112
01:53:45.401 --> 01:53:46.944
You did?
Yes.

1113
01:53:47.529 --> 01:53:50.030
There's more to you than meets the eye,
Goodnight.

1114
01:54:00.250 --> 01:54:02.292
Goodnight, I hate to
ask stupid questions,

1115
01:54:02.377 --> 01:54:04.711
but where exactly
did you knock him cold?

1116
01:54:04.796 --> 01:54:06.922
He landed
in that one.

1117
01:54:07.423 --> 01:54:09.842
Don't you
believe in signs?

1118
01:54:09.926 --> 01:54:11.677
We've got about
five minutes before his

1119
01:54:11.761 --> 01:54:14.805
body temperature raises that helium
well above zero.

1120
01:54:14.889 --> 01:54:17.349
Then this whole damn place will
go sky high.

1121
01:54:17.433 --> 01:54:19.768
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

1122
01:55:41.434 --> 01:55:43.060
kill the beam!

1123
01:55:45.021 --> 01:55:47.022
Hit the master
override switch!

1124
01:55:47.106 --> 01:55:48.273
The what?

1125
01:55:48.358 --> 01:55:50.025
Goodnight?

1126
01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:51.109
Yes, James.

1127
01:55:51.194 --> 01:55:53.612
Now, listen carefully.

1128
01:55:53.696 --> 01:55:55.155
There's a console
up there.

1129
01:55:55.239 --> 01:55:58.450
Now, there must be
a scanner interlock button on it.

1130
01:55:58.534 --> 01:55:59.826
Push it!

1131
01:56:01.371 --> 01:56:03.372
Goodnight, are
you still there?

1132
01:56:03.456 --> 01:56:05.999
It'll be on the auxiliary
feedback circuit.

1133
01:56:08.419 --> 01:56:11.630
Computer interlock.
Is that it?

1134
01:56:12.048 --> 01:56:14.466
Just push every
damn button, will you?

1135
01:56:33.403 --> 01:56:35.529
Good girl, Goodnight.
You've done it.

1136
01:56:35.613 --> 01:56:37.572
Oh, I have?

1137
01:57:21.117 --> 01:57:23.952
Goodnight, get the hell out
of there! I've got it!

1138
01:57:58.279 --> 01:57:59.571
I hope you can
swim, Goodnight.

1139
01:57:59.655 --> 01:58:01.114
This way.

1140
01:58:02.325 --> 01:58:05.077
His junk is moored
around the corner.

1141
01:59:08.599 --> 01:59:10.892
But, darling,
who is at the wheel?

1142
01:59:10.977 --> 01:59:12.477
George.
George?

1143
01:59:13.729 --> 01:59:15.438
Automatic pilot.

1144
01:59:16.899 --> 01:59:20.861
We should make Hong Kong
in about eight hours.

1145
01:59:22.905 --> 01:59:25.115
Give or take a little.

1146
01:59:44.177 --> 01:59:47.345
I always wanted to take
a slow boat from China.

1147
02:00:33.768 --> 02:00:35.101
I'll kill you.

1148
02:00:36.145 --> 02:00:37.646
I'll kill you!

1149
02:00:38.731 --> 02:00:40.315
Why, you...

1150
02:01:24.318 --> 02:01:25.944
Wait! Just wait!

1151
02:01:29.782 --> 02:01:31.366
Son of a bitch! Ow!

1152
02:01:32.493 --> 02:01:34.953
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?
Get in there.

1153
02:01:35.037 --> 02:01:36.413
Ouch!

1154
02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:40.041
Come on!
I can't breathe!

1155
02:01:40.334 --> 02:01:41.751
Ow!

1156
02:01:42.211 --> 02:01:44.129
You'll be sorry!

1157
02:01:44.213 --> 02:01:46.715
I may be small,
but I never forget!

1158
02:01:50.553 --> 02:01:53.722
I'll kill you if you don't let me
out of here! Ow!

1159
02:01:54.056 --> 02:01:56.516
Let me out,
you big bully!

1160
02:01:56.684 --> 02:01:58.184
Shut up.

1161
02:02:03.649 --> 02:02:05.483
What did you
do with him?

1162
02:02:05.568 --> 02:02:07.027
What do you think?

1163
02:02:07.653 --> 02:02:09.237
Oh, James, you didn't.

1164
02:02:09.322 --> 02:02:11.156
Yes, I damn well did.

1165
02:02:11.949 --> 02:02:14.909
Got all the glass out
of the bed, I trust.

1166
02:02:15.536 --> 02:02:19.247
We don't want anything
else to disturb our peace, do we?

1167
02:02:26.255 --> 02:02:28.673
Now, where were we?

1168
02:02:29.633 --> 02:02:31.134
Oh, James.

1169
02:02:42.313 --> 02:02:44.105
What's the matter?

1170
02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:47.567
Something came up.

1171
02:02:51.781 --> 02:02:53.031
Hello?

1172
02:02:53.115 --> 02:02:55.158
Ah! There you are, Bond.

1173
02:02:55.493 --> 02:02:57.869
well done.
Congratulations.

1174
02:02:58.579 --> 02:02:59.662
Thank you, sir.

1175
02:02:59.747 --> 02:03:03.083
Is Miss Goodnight with you?
I'd like a word with her.

1176
02:03:03.167 --> 02:03:04.667
hold on, sir.

1177
02:03:15.221 --> 02:03:17.472
Bond? Bond,
are you there?

1178
02:03:19.725 --> 02:03:21.142
Goodnight?

1179
02:03:22.645 --> 02:03:24.646
She's just coming, sir.

1180
02:03:31.987 --> 02:03:36.324
Goodnight?

1181
02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:40.203
Goodnight.
Good night, sir.

1182
02:03:47.795 --> 02:03:50.922
Good night,
Goodnight

1183
02:03:51.674 --> 02:03:54.884
Sleep well, my dear

1184
02:03:55.761 --> 02:03:58.888
No need to fear

1185
02:03:59.682 --> 02:04:03.935
James Bond is here

1186
02:04:11.026 --> 02:04:15.655
Oh, love is required
whenever he's hired

1187
02:04:15.739 --> 02:04:19.451
It comes just before the kill

1188
02:04:19.535 --> 02:04:21.455
No one can catch him

1189
02:04:21.535 --> 02:04:23.620
No hit man can match him

1190
02:04:23.706 --> 02:04:27.000
For his million-dollar skill

1191
02:04:27.085 --> 02:04:31.505
One golden shot means
another poor victim

1192
02:04:31.590 --> 02:04:34.840
Has come to a glittering end

1193
02:04:36.175 --> 02:04:39.595
If you want
to get rid of someone

1194
02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:42.975
The man with the golden gun

1195
02:04:43.060 --> 02:04:45.895
will get it done

1196
02:04:46.645 --> 02:04:50.100
He'll shoot anyone

1197
02:04:50.124 --> 02:04:52.124
