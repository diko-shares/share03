00:01:43.134 --> 00:01:46.231

I'm glad you're here, Lee! I always
feel better with you watching my back

8
00:02:09.743 --> 00:02:12.553
I'm just doing my job, Mr. Ambassador

00:02:12.976 --> 00:02:18.148
Stay close to me today
Lee, we're making history.

10
00:02:19.554 --> 00:02:22.128
This is bullshit! You know who I am?

11
00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.588
My family owns half of Rodeo drive!

12
00:02:24.075 --> 00:02:27.312
Do you know who I am?
Detective James Carter. L.A.P.D.

13
00:02:27.938 --> 00:02:29.504
My family owns half of Crenshaw Blvd.

14
00:02:29.505 --> 00:02:30.722
I want a lawyer

15
00:02:30.723 --> 00:02:33.068
You need a personal trainer,
it's like you're a 180 Ibs.

16
00:02:33.095 --> 00:02:34.713
You weigh more then
the damn car, girl.

17
00:02:34.714 --> 00:02:35.757
I have a Tyroid condition,

18
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.194
What's that mean Tyroid's?

19
00:02:37.403 --> 00:02:41.706
Look... can't you just like
give us a warning or something?

20
00:02:41.743 --> 00:02:47.479
That depends... you girls like Chinese?

21
00:02:47.516 --> 00:02:49.158
Excuse me.

22
00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:50.648
Carter?

23
00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:53.776
Lee, we're on for tonight, I just
picked up 2 girls, who wanna play hot...

24
00:02:53.777 --> 00:02:54.820
with an Asian Policeman

25
00:02:55.146 --> 00:02:58.415
I can't talk now, I'm in
the car with Ambassador Han.

26
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.782
Trust me. These girls are
sushi great, we gotta hit these!

27
00:03:00.783 --> 00:03:02.102
I have to go, I'm sorry.

28
00:03:02.138 --> 00:03:03.774
You're still mad at me aren't you?

29
00:03:03.775 --> 00:03:06.235
You're mad because of what
happened when we was in New York.

30
00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:07.287
I don't want to talk about that.

31
00:03:07.288 --> 00:03:09.549
That was 3 years ago,
when you gonna let it go?

32
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.089
Let it go? Isabelle was my girlfriend.

33
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.092
Lee, we're friends man, just come
over here one night, the Wushu's on me.

34
00:03:16.647 --> 00:03:19.007
Lee?

35
00:03:20.751 --> 00:03:23.456
My mom says hi.

36
00:03:50.046 --> 00:03:53.908
The Chinese Triads now
has a 1/2 million members,

37
00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:55.827
In over one 100 countrys, and...

38
00:03:55.834 --> 00:04:00.279
these are not street kids,
shaking down local merchants.

39
00:04:00.384 --> 00:04:03.537
These are buisness men,
who build a $50 billion

40
00:04:03.565 --> 00:04:06.519
empire on extortion,
drugs, sex and slavery.

41
00:04:07.787 --> 00:04:12.962
We must cut off the head... of this
snake, before it swallows us whole.

42
00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.976
As Chairman of the World Criminal Court, I have
intrusted my good friend, Ambassador Han...

43
00:04:18.402 --> 00:04:22.186
to lead the Fight, against the largest
criminal organization in the world.

44
00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:40.940
Ladies and Gentlemen.

45
00:04:41.984 --> 00:04:45.216
The Triads society is build on secrecy

46
00:04:46.722 --> 00:04:51.071
Nobody knows who these men are
who control them, who leads them.

47
00:04:51.107 --> 00:04:53.887
Nobody has known for 500 years.

48
00:04:53.924 --> 00:04:57.221
But today I stand before
you with a secret of my own.

49
00:04:57.264 --> 00:05:02.341
Today I will disclose information
that effects everyone in this room.

50
00:05:02.553 --> 00:05:04.325
After years of searching,

51
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:06.795
I believe I finally
located the Sha Xing.

52
00:05:07.042 --> 00:05:10.659
Mr. Ambassador, Sha Xing is not exist.

53
00:05:10.696 --> 00:05:13.580
Excuse me, who is this Sha Xing?

54
00:05:13.617 --> 00:05:16.154
With all due respect, Sir. I like...

55
00:05:25.203 --> 00:05:27.917
Everybody down!

56
00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.606
- Call an ambulance!
- Someone get a doctor!

57
00:05:30.607 --> 00:05:33.692
- Ambassador down!
- The Ambassador is down!

58
00:05:33.703 --> 00:05:35.402
Stay with him!

59
00:06:08.851 --> 00:06:10.874
Na... ah, ah, I'm keeping
these, 'till I see you tonight,

60
00:06:10.895 --> 00:06:16.192
World authority, World Criminal Court
Bldg. The Chinese Ambassador has been shot!

61
00:06:16.296 --> 00:06:19.069
Chinese Ambassador? - Move
your ass girl, move over! - Shit

62
00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:02.465
Lee!

63
00:07:05.593 --> 00:07:08.722
What the Hell is he doin'?

64
00:07:10.807 --> 00:07:15.520
- L.A.P.D. get out of my way!
- Give us a brake.

65
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.043
Hey Lee, I'll get you when I come back,

66
00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:44.047
Lee, I'm coming!

67
00:07:59.563 --> 00:08:01.481
Don't move!

68
00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:07.278
Hello, Lee.

69
00:08:15.953 --> 00:08:17.919
Put your hands up, Kenji!

70
00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:21.750
Lee, what're you waiting for? Shoot me.

71
00:08:27.297 --> 00:08:29.466
Maybe this will help.

72
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:38.308
Drop the gun or I'll shoot!

73
00:08:38.725 --> 00:08:42.020
I think we both know,
that's not gonna happen.

74
00:08:46.608 --> 00:08:47.984
Kenji!

75
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:50.951
You see?

76
00:08:50.987 --> 00:08:52.780
I know you too well.

77
00:09:08.545 --> 00:09:10.756
Lee, you okay?

78
00:09:13.425 --> 00:09:16.387
Lee, I all-most killed your
ass, why didn't you move?

79
00:09:17.429 --> 00:09:20.724
I like you to meet our dates for
this evening, Marsha and Dora.

80
00:09:20.725 --> 00:09:22.811
The Fat one's yours!

81
00:09:29.128 --> 00:09:31.422
How many times you want
me to say it, I'm sorry...

82
00:09:31.423 --> 00:09:33.340
I'm sorry I ran you over, man, damn.

83
00:09:33.341 --> 00:09:34.530
Not now all right... not now

84
00:09:34.592 --> 00:09:36.635
All right, hold it right there.

85
00:09:36.637 --> 00:09:37.720
Don't say a word Carter.

86
00:09:37.721 --> 00:09:39.763
Capt. O'Neal, I had
nothing to do with this.

87
00:09:39.764 --> 00:09:41.682
All I did was borrow a
car and backed up Lee.

88
00:09:41.849 --> 00:09:43.058
Tell him partner.

89
00:09:43.059 --> 00:09:44.893
I need to see Ambassador Han.

90
00:09:44.894 --> 00:09:46.895
The Ambassador is just out of surgery.

91
00:09:46.896 --> 00:09:49.273
The bullet missed his
heart. He's gonna be okay.

92
00:09:49.274 --> 00:09:51.775
Capt'n, you have to give me back
my shield and put me on this case.

93
00:09:51.776 --> 00:09:53.986
I made one little mistake,
take a brother of the bench.

94
00:09:53.987 --> 00:09:56.488
One little mistake? You handcuffed
2 woman, and stole their car.

95
00:09:56.489 --> 00:09:59.949
Isn't that why we have insurance?
Anyone has an off day Capt'n.

96
00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.766
Last month you arrested 6 Iranians
and put them in jail for a week.

97
00:10:02.767 --> 00:10:05.538
You and I both know them
Iranians was terrorist.

98
00:10:05.539 --> 00:10:07.791
They were scientist at UCLA.

99
00:10:07.792 --> 00:10:10.168
Big deal... 'cause they
cure cancer in rats...

100
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.169
that doesn't mean
they dont blow shit up!

101
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.963
Sir, let me find the person
who shot Ambassador Han.

102
00:10:13.964 --> 00:10:16.924
Relax Carter, the L.A.P.D. will
be heading this investigation.

103
00:10:16.925 --> 00:10:19.176
The Ambassador is my responsibility.

104
00:10:19.177 --> 00:10:22.138
Then maybe you can tell me
exactly how the shooter got away.

105
00:10:23.264 --> 00:10:27.810
Also... the Ambassador's daughter is
coming here to see her father right now.

106
00:10:27.811 --> 00:10:29.230
Make sure nothing happends to her!

107
00:10:29.603 --> 00:10:31.938
Don't worry, Capt'n,
we gonna make you proud.

108
00:10:31.939 --> 00:10:33.983
And try not to think about
your wife leaving you.

109
00:10:33.984 --> 00:10:35.734
She'll come back.

110
00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:38.403
Soo Yung's here? I haven't seen
her since she was 10 years old.

111
00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:40.697
She lives here in Los Angelos now.

112
00:10:40.698 --> 00:10:43.076
Let's go to the gift shop and
get her a little teddy bear,

113
00:10:43.918 --> 00:10:45.971
In a bra...

114
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.581
Lee, I'm so glad you're here.

115
00:10:50.936 --> 00:10:52.855
Detective Carter.

116
00:10:53.189 --> 00:10:56.275
- It's been so long.
- So long... Soo Yung, so long.

117
00:10:57.985 --> 00:11:00.279
- How is he?
- He is out of surgery.

118
00:11:01.029 --> 00:11:03.240
They said he will be okay.

119
00:11:05.327 --> 00:11:07.119
Soo Yung, I'm sorry.

120
00:11:07.953 --> 00:11:11.623
It was my fault. I didn't
get to him fast enough.

121
00:11:15.376 --> 00:11:18.255
I want you both... to
promise me something.

122
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.008
I want you to find the
man who did this to him.

123
00:11:22.009 --> 00:11:23.259
I want you to find him because...

124
00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.179
I don't think he'll stop
untill my father is dead.

125
00:11:26.471 --> 00:11:27.847
Soo Yung.

126
00:11:27.848 --> 00:11:29.431
I need to hear you say it.

127
00:11:31.434 --> 00:11:33.394
Okay, I promise.

128
00:11:33.395 --> 00:11:34.979
And so do I.

129
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:39.984
Thank you.

130
00:11:40.276 --> 00:11:43.696
Soo Yung, your father was addressing
the court before he was shot.

131
00:11:44.697 --> 00:11:47.866
2 weeks ago, my father
mailed me an envelope...

132
00:11:48.116 --> 00:11:51.620
he said, if anything ever happend
to him, I should give it to you

133
00:11:51.621 --> 00:11:52.621
Where is it?

134
00:11:52.622 --> 00:11:53.914
I put it in my locker...

135
00:11:53.915 --> 00:11:56.333
at the Kung Fu studio, where I teach,

136
00:11:56.334 --> 00:12:01.379
It's at 8347 First Street... China Town.

137
00:12:13.432 --> 00:12:16.144
Go home, Carter, this has
nothing to do with you,

138
00:12:16.145 --> 00:12:18.771
I made Soo Yung a
promise the same as you.

139
00:12:18.772 --> 00:12:21.065
This is a business of China,

140
00:12:21.066 --> 00:12:23.067
Well for your information
I'm part Chinese now,

141
00:12:23.693 --> 00:12:26.862
That's right Lee, for the last 3 year,
I studied at the Institute of the Budah...

142
00:12:26.863 --> 00:12:29.992
Earning 2 black belts
in Wushu Martial arts

143
00:12:29.993 --> 00:12:32.578
And spending every afternoon at
the Hong Kong Massage Parlor...

144
00:12:32.826 --> 00:12:33.994
I'm half Chinese, baby!

145
00:12:33.995 --> 00:12:36.163
If you're half Chinese,
I'm half black...

146
00:12:36.164 --> 00:12:39.457
I'm your brother, and I'm fly,
you're done with this, Snoopy?

147
00:12:39.459 --> 00:12:40.751
That's dope, ain'it?

148
00:12:41.043 --> 00:12:42.920
Sorry Lee, you can't be black!

149
00:12:42.921 --> 00:12:45.171
There's a height requirement. I'm
still with you, no matter what,

150
00:12:45.255 --> 00:12:46.422
Go home, Carter!

151
00:12:46.424 --> 00:12:49.926
I can't leave you, Lee,
now you're my "Peng You"

152
00:12:49.968 --> 00:12:51.719
I can't leave my brother!

153
00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.658
All right, listen up!

154
00:13:13.991 --> 00:13:15.748
I need everyone's attention!

155
00:13:15.785 --> 00:13:18.975
I'm Detective Carter,
this is Inspector Lee

156
00:13:19.011 --> 00:13:22.129
We need see Soo Yung's locker right now!

157
00:13:22.166 --> 00:13:25.001
No one is allowed in the back,
without the master's permission,

158
00:13:25.038 --> 00:13:28.255
Maybe you didn't hear me,
we need to see that locker

159
00:13:28.839 --> 00:13:30.194
I'm sorry

160
00:13:30.231 --> 00:13:31.549
Wait, Carter!

161
00:13:31.591 --> 00:13:33.177
Lee, I got this!

162
00:13:34.011 --> 00:13:35.762
Hey!

163
00:13:36.137 --> 00:13:39.313
Kids listen, Knife's will solve nothing,

164
00:13:39.349 --> 00:13:42.602
As the Chinese say, all great
battles are won without fighting,

165
00:13:42.727 --> 00:13:43.999
Sorry!
- Ok?

166
00:13:44.035 --> 00:13:45.272
I don't know him!

167
00:13:51.987 --> 00:13:53.154
Look!

168
00:13:54.364 --> 00:13:55.823
Let's try again from the top!

169
00:13:57.574 --> 00:13:59.582
None of the Wushu formality,

170
00:13:59.619 --> 00:14:01.662
You ain't gonna see it coming...

171
00:14:02.037 --> 00:14:03.622
Stop!

172
00:14:04.832 --> 00:14:06.959
Run for your lives!

173
00:14:07.126 --> 00:14:09.544
It's about time, I get some
respect around here!

174
00:14:11.151 --> 00:14:14.258
Carter, wait for the master!

175
00:14:17.115 --> 00:14:19.534
Whoa, damn!

176
00:14:20.952 --> 00:14:24.497
Sorry, man, I thought
this was the bathroom, sorry!

177
00:14:25.541 --> 00:14:27.875
Lee, I got a big problem, man!

178
00:14:27.876 --> 00:14:29.962
This boy's on steroid's,
he's got a head like King Kong.

179
00:14:29.963 --> 00:14:31.212
Oh no!

180
00:14:34.882 --> 00:14:36.676
Carter? You're okay?

181
00:14:36.712 --> 00:14:37.885
Lee, Lee...

182
00:14:45.053 --> 00:14:47.269
Awww... my bunion.

183
00:14:56.278 --> 00:14:58.738
Come on, man, let me go,
I love Chinese people.

184
00:15:00.114 --> 00:15:01.073
Wait!

185
00:15:13.565 --> 00:15:15.818
How you say surrender in Chinese?

186
00:15:17.591 --> 00:15:24.160
Okay, I'm gonna slice you up
like a Giant California Roll

187
00:15:55.397 --> 00:15:56.690
I'm sorry!

188
00:16:14.645 --> 00:16:16.730
May I help you?

189
00:16:16.897 --> 00:16:18.940
We'll be asking you questions, old man

190
00:16:19.004 --> 00:16:19.775
Who are you?

191
00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:20.364
Yu!

192
00:16:20.401 --> 00:16:21.360
Not me, you!

193
00:16:21.396 --> 00:16:22.282
Yes, I'm Yu

194
00:16:22.319 --> 00:16:24.112
Just answer the damn
question, who are you?

195
00:16:24.149 --> 00:16:25.368
I've told you!

196
00:16:25.405 --> 00:16:27.741
Are you deaf?
- No, Yu is blind,

197
00:16:27.777 --> 00:16:29.051
I'm not blind, you're blind,

198
00:16:29.088 --> 00:16:30.290
That's what I just say,

199
00:16:30.326 --> 00:16:32.663
You just say what?
- I did not say what, I say Yu,

200
00:16:32.699 --> 00:16:33.877
That why I ask you,

201
00:16:33.914 --> 00:16:35.915
And you're not answering...
- Shut up!

202
00:16:35.952 --> 00:16:37.005
You!
- Yes?

203
00:16:37.041 --> 00:16:38.835

206
00:16:42.693 --> 00:16:45.446
And I'm gonna whoop your ass

207
00:16:45.482 --> 00:16:48.865

208
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.540
Carter!

209
00:16:51.577 --> 00:16:53.453
- Lee, no, no,
- Carter,

210
00:16:55.455 --> 00:16:59.167
Teacher, My name is Inspector Lee.
We have a key to Soo Yung's locker,

211
00:17:01.586 --> 00:17:04.006
Some men came here this morning,
they had guns. They emptied...

212
00:17:04.042 --> 00:17:06.424
her locker, I could not stop them,

213
00:17:06.591 --> 00:17:07.800
You must go to her at once,

214
00:17:07.837 --> 00:17:08.473
Why?

215
00:17:08.509 --> 00:17:12.805
They said, she would end up
like her father.

216
00:17:13.598 --> 00:17:14.974
Let's go! Thank you.

217
00:17:15.766 --> 00:17:19.312
I don't know what the hell you feeding him, but he's too damn big.
- Carter, let's go!

218
00:17:41.499 --> 00:17:43.085
Where's everyone?

219
00:17:43.121 --> 00:17:44.669
Where's all the damn cops?

220
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.223
Lee?

221
00:17:51.259 --> 00:17:52.057
Where's the security?

222
00:17:52.093 --> 00:17:53.553
They were called away.

223
00:17:53.594 --> 00:17:55.096
What's wrong?

224
00:17:55.514 --> 00:17:57.140
Carter!

225
00:18:00.309 --> 00:18:02.395
They're coming for him!

226
00:18:02.562 --> 00:18:03.980
What do we do?

227
00:18:16.575 --> 00:18:17.743
No!

228
00:18:20.954 --> 00:18:22.331
No!

229
00:18:23.749 --> 00:18:25.418
Don't move or I'll blow your ass' Jigsaw

230
00:18:27.335 --> 00:18:29.046
Get back!

231
00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:32.528
Who send you?

232
00:18:33.905 --> 00:18:34.989
Oh!

233
00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:38.409
Don't move!

234
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:44.623
Lee, throw me a gun!

235
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.291
Throw me a gun!

236
00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:49.711
Damn, Lee!

237
00:19:16.445 --> 00:19:18.697
Lee, I thought you watched my back!

238
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.923
Soo Yung, one more!

239
00:19:43.763 --> 00:19:47.976
Lee, I'm in trouble, need assistance!

240
00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.314
- Empty!
- What?

241
00:20:02.573 --> 00:20:04.388
You see, I always guard your back,

242
00:20:04.425 --> 00:20:06.202
Why the hell you give me
an empty gun?

243
00:20:06.239 --> 00:20:07.703
I didn't know,

244
00:20:08.662 --> 00:20:10.540
You almost got me killed, Lee!

245
00:20:13.918 --> 00:20:15.502
Who send you?

246
00:20:19.194 --> 00:20:20.299
What the hell is that?

247
00:20:20.335 --> 00:20:21.367
I think he's speaking French,

248
00:20:21.404 --> 00:20:23.990
French? What kind of Chinese speaks French?
Tell me something and dont play around,

249
00:20:24.574 --> 00:20:26.367
Ok, I tell him, I don't speak French!

250
00:20:26.404 --> 00:20:27.577
No!

251
00:20:31.749 --> 00:20:34.876
No! Stop humiliating yourself!

252
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:42.592
Find someone here, who
speaks French, please,

253
00:20:44.176 --> 00:20:45.594
Speak English!

254
00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:50.224
This is Sister Agnes,
from the chapel upstair...

255
00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.929
she speaks fluent French, and she's
pleased to intrubite for you,

256
00:20:53.268 --> 00:20:54.894
Sister, we appreciate
you're doing this

257
00:20:54.931 --> 00:20:55.901
My Pleasure!

258
00:20:55.938 --> 00:20:58.899
Sister Agnes, please ask who send him!

259
00:21:04.988 --> 00:21:07.412
He said, you both making a big mistake

260
00:21:07.448 --> 00:21:10.618
That one day, you'll beg him
for mercy, he also said...

261
00:21:11.244 --> 00:21:12.620
What?

262
00:21:12.829 --> 00:21:15.415
Please, Sister, we have to know!

263
00:21:15.451 --> 00:21:16.412
There's lifes at stake.

264
00:21:16.583 --> 00:21:18.376
Well, he used the "N" word

265
00:21:18.412 --> 00:21:20.169
What, the "N" word?

266
00:21:20.962 --> 00:21:22.672
- You tell this little mother...
- Carter!

267
00:21:24.006 --> 00:21:25.424
She's a nun,

268
00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:31.096
Sister, you tell this piece of "S" word,
that I will personally "F" word him up!

269
00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.029
Did he say Nigger?

270
00:21:42.066 --> 00:21:45.485
He use the "N" word again, but this
time he mention your grandmother

271
00:21:45.521 --> 00:21:48.030
You tell him, that his mama is a "H",

272
00:21:48.066 --> 00:21:49.369
Carter!

273
00:21:49.406 --> 00:21:51.246
I believe Whore is spelled with a "W"

274
00:21:51.282 --> 00:21:55.537
Right, "W", and his sister's a "W",
and his grandmama is 2 big "W's"...

275
00:21:55.573 --> 00:21:57.702
who makes 2 double that's got no "T's"!

276
00:21:57.739 --> 00:21:59.833
You tell I'm said that!

277
00:22:11.573 --> 00:22:12.496
Did he say it again?

278
00:22:12.533 --> 00:22:18.789
No, this time, he called this Gentleman
a word that means cat and another word

279
00:22:18.825 --> 00:22:20.457
that rhymes with matt,

280
00:22:20.493 --> 00:22:21.833
What?

281
00:22:22.041 --> 00:22:24.794
Would you tell him, his an "AW"

282
00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.609
Lee, hole is spelled with "H",

283
00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:29.410
I have a dictionary upstair.

284
00:22:29.446 --> 00:22:31.175
Just call him an asshole!

285
00:22:35.784 --> 00:22:38.537
He said you both are marked for
death, like Han the girl,

286
00:22:38.573 --> 00:22:41.289
Sister, turn your back, you
don't want to see this!

287
00:22:41.326 --> 00:22:43.296
Who is Sha Xing, and how do we find him?

288
00:22:43.333 --> 00:22:46.086
Tell me right now, or I'll cut
your beets off, and shove'm in your mouth

289
00:22:46.122 --> 00:22:47.050
His beets?

290
00:22:47.087 --> 00:22:49.006
His beets, Sister He's carreing

291
00:22:49.964 --> 00:22:51.513
Tell me something now!

292
00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:54.469
Lee, give me the gun,
give me the gun, Lee!

293
00:22:58.723 --> 00:23:00.391
Who is Sha Xing?

294
00:23:00.428 --> 00:23:02.202
What he say Sister?

295
00:23:02.238 --> 00:23:03.978
He said shoot me!

296
00:23:04.145 --> 00:23:06.939
Lee, there's no bullets in here.

297
00:23:06.975 --> 00:23:07.737
Sorry!

298
00:23:07.773 --> 00:23:10.026
I'm trying to kill somebody, man!

299
00:23:10.485 --> 00:23:11.902
Damn!

300
00:23:12.278 --> 00:23:13.033
Ok!

301
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:15.238
You better tell me somethin' right now,
or I'll send you right to heaven!

302
00:23:15.275 --> 00:23:18.742
- Carter, stop!
- Tell me now, I ain't got nothin' to loose,

303
00:23:19.576 --> 00:23:22.203
That's right sister, tell the lord he's
gonna have some company.

304
00:23:22.704 --> 00:23:25.332
- Carter, stop!
- Tell me somethin'!

305
00:23:26.833 --> 00:23:30.691
- Carter Enough!
- She's almost done, just give me father fire.

306
00:23:30.754 --> 00:23:32.047
Just wait!

307
00:23:35.508 --> 00:23:36.640
What did he say?

308
00:23:36.676 --> 00:23:39.178
50 Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jon Piere,

309
00:23:40.721 --> 00:23:42.349
Thank you!

310
00:23:42.933 --> 00:23:45.518
Nice working with you, Sister!

311
00:23:45.554 --> 00:23:47.436
Anytime, brother!

312
00:23:49.293 --> 00:23:52.191
- 50 F.D.R.
- It's an address

313
00:23:52.192 --> 00:23:55.216
It's a wild goose chase, every city in
America has a street named after Roosevelt,

314
00:23:55.236 --> 00:23:57.446
- Who's Jon Piere?
- I don't know!

315
00:23:57.655 --> 00:24:00.157
Soo Yung, we're getting you out of here!

316
00:24:00.193 --> 00:24:00.829
Why?

317
00:24:00.866 --> 00:24:02.118
Is not safe here!

318
00:24:02.154 --> 00:24:03.595
I won't leave him!

319
00:24:03.631 --> 00:24:05.037
We have no choice!

320
00:24:29.811 --> 00:24:31.854
- Soo Yung?
- Mr. Reynard.

321
00:24:33.063 --> 00:24:34.904
I'm glad your father is ok.

322
00:24:34.941 --> 00:24:37.026
My people won't leave his side,
you have my word.

323
00:24:37.276 --> 00:24:38.715
Thank you!

324
00:24:38.751 --> 00:24:40.155
So, let's go!

325
00:24:40.572 --> 00:24:42.161
Where am I going?

326
00:24:42.198 --> 00:24:45.159
We're getting out from this
Area, it's not safe for us!

327
00:24:45.195 --> 00:24:47.625
Just for a few days, Soo Yung, I promise

328
00:24:47.662 --> 00:24:50.080
You're coming with me, and
my family to Paris!

329
00:24:52.959 --> 00:24:54.502
Ok!

330
00:24:59.047 --> 00:25:00.924
Wait!

331
00:25:02.676 --> 00:25:04.803
You made me a promise!

332
00:25:06.513 --> 00:25:08.306
Don't forget!

333
00:25:19.067 --> 00:25:20.902
My God!

334
00:25:21.486 --> 00:25:24.071
We got an Assasin in custody that
only speaks French,

335
00:25:24.342 --> 00:25:30.202
A limo blows up at the French Counsulat, and the next
meeting of the world court is in Paris 2 days from now

336
00:25:30.327 --> 00:25:32.288
Are you thinking what I am thinking?

337
00:25:32.325 --> 00:25:33.086
Yeah!

338
00:25:33.122 --> 00:25:37.877
We go to Fiji, we head out there for a year, we
change our names, get jobs and I'll call you Kiko!

339
00:25:38.294 --> 00:25:41.296
We have to find Sha Xing,
before he finds us!

340
00:25:41.463 --> 00:25:43.882
- We're going to Paris, ha?
- Yes, tonight!

341
00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:58.063
Did you know, the average french
women is naked 34% at a time?

342
00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.899
We not going there for the women!

343
00:26:02.483 --> 00:26:05.111
You have to forget about her,
and let me hook you up!

344
00:26:05.148 --> 00:26:06.243
Hook me up?

345
00:26:06.279 --> 00:26:08.322
After what you did to Isabella?

346
00:26:08.359 --> 00:26:09.913
It was an accident!

347
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:11.951
Besides, you never even slept with her,

348
00:26:11.988 --> 00:26:13.679
Thanks to you, but it was going to happen!

349
00:26:13.715 --> 00:26:16.518
- But you had to ruin it,
- What did I do, that was so terrible?

350
00:26:16.539 --> 00:26:19.250
You shot my girlfriend, in the neck.

351
00:26:19.286 --> 00:26:21.960
- There's nothing else to say,
- Now that she died...

352
00:26:21.997 --> 00:26:24.458
So she had a cute li'll ass,
so she worked at air boco loco,

353
00:26:24.547 --> 00:26:28.175
That was temporarily, as soon as she
complaint the secret service took her back.

354
00:26:28.759 --> 00:26:32.179
You know what your problem is,
you need to relax, have some fun...

355
00:26:32.215 --> 00:26:34.431
you have to much rice in your diet
and you're constipated,

356
00:26:34.473 --> 00:26:35.808
I never should have brought you!

357
00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:37.940
Listen, you need me, brother,

358
00:26:37.976 --> 00:26:41.312
I don't need anyone, and
please don't call me brother

359
00:26:41.354 --> 00:26:42.627
What's this?

360
00:26:42.663 --> 00:26:43.914
Underground they have in Paris

361
00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.448
Forget it!

362
00:26:46.484 --> 00:26:48.403
Check out the address!

363
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:50.947
50 Franklin D. Roosevelt,

364
00:26:50.984 --> 00:26:53.324
Like I said, you need me.

365
00:26:53.574 --> 00:26:57.328
Excuse me, can we have one bag
Potato chips and some Exlax's.

366
00:27:05.148 --> 00:27:06.816
Where're the bag's at?

367
00:27:08.068 --> 00:27:10.445
Excuse me, Gentleman.

368
00:27:11.654 --> 00:27:14.074
Would you please come with me?

369
00:27:14.111 --> 00:27:15.330
Why?

370
00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:17.785
Just need to ask you a few questions.

371
00:27:17.822 --> 00:27:20.497
Ouch! Oh my god! Damn!

372
00:27:22.999 --> 00:27:26.043
That's one of the worst
airports I've ever been to,

373
00:27:29.047 --> 00:27:30.595
Now that I have your attention,

374
00:27:30.631 --> 00:27:33.468
Why don't you tell me what you cops are
looking for here in Paris?

375
00:27:33.504 --> 00:27:35.720
I told you, man, we're on vacation.

376
00:27:35.756 --> 00:27:37.268
Just taking in the sites.

377
00:27:37.304 --> 00:27:42.309
Gentleman, this is my city, and
I must force away two stupid cops...

378
00:27:42.346 --> 00:27:45.705
come here and get their heads
blown off by the Triads.

379
00:27:45.741 --> 00:27:49.066
Now I can't force you to leave
but I can make a suggestion.

380
00:27:49.566 --> 00:27:54.530
After all, I found this dirty
little gun inside your jacket.

381
00:27:54.566 --> 00:27:58.324
Which means you could both
do 20 years in my jail.

382
00:27:58.491 --> 00:28:00.577
Do we understand each other?

383
00:28:00.911 --> 00:28:03.079
Do we understand each other?

384
00:28:03.413 --> 00:28:05.039
Excellent

385
00:28:05.081 --> 00:28:07.500
It was wonderful meeting you both.

386
00:28:08.668 --> 00:28:10.461
So we can go now?

387
00:28:10.711 --> 00:28:12.464
This will just take a moment.

388
00:28:13.131 --> 00:28:14.924
Welcome to Paris.

389
00:28:15.091 --> 00:28:16.342
Oh shit

390
00:28:30.147 --> 00:28:31.487
Where're you go?

391
00:28:31.524 --> 00:28:34.151
50 Franklin D. Roosevelt

392
00:28:34.401 --> 00:28:35.902
No, get out!

393
00:28:36.153 --> 00:28:36.867
What?

394
00:28:36.903 --> 00:28:37.947
I don't drive his kind.

395
00:28:37.983 --> 00:28:38.869
My kind?

396
00:28:38.906 --> 00:28:40.741
Americans, I don't drive Americans.

397
00:28:40.777 --> 00:28:41.705
But I'm Chinese.

398
00:28:41.741 --> 00:28:44.787
Yeah, but you're with him, and
they're the most violent people I know.

399
00:28:44.823 --> 00:28:47.539
Always starting war,
always killing people.

400
00:28:47.575 --> 00:28:48.795
Americans make me sick.

401
00:28:48.832 --> 00:28:50.923
Look, man, we're not
in the mood for this.

402
00:28:50.959 --> 00:28:53.795
Me and my partner just got
violated by a small Frenchman.

403
00:28:53.831 --> 00:28:55.218
Wearing a very large ring.

404
00:28:55.254 --> 00:28:57.507
You're a pathetic bunch of criminals

405
00:28:57.544 --> 00:28:58.847
Always resorting to violence.

406
00:28:58.883 --> 00:29:00.557
Always pushing around the little guy.

407
00:29:00.593 --> 00:29:02.511
That is not true,
Americans are not violent.

408
00:29:02.548 --> 00:29:04.040
Our man in America is a joke.

409
00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:06.041
You lost in Vietnam, you lost in Iraq

410
00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:08.830
You can't even beat the
Europeans in basketball anymore.

411
00:29:08.866 --> 00:29:10.788
The dream team is death.

412
00:29:10.824 --> 00:29:12.673
I didn't hear you, man

413
00:29:12.709 --> 00:29:14.966
Talking about the NBA,
I dare you, I double dare you,

414
00:29:15.003 --> 00:29:18.465
Even with you're skinny woman
like Halle Berry.

415
00:29:18.673 --> 00:29:20.300
Oh, now you're going to far.

416
00:29:20.336 --> 00:29:22.110
You want violence frenchman, realy?

417
00:29:22.147 --> 00:29:23.887
Do you want violence? Well, you got it

418
00:29:23.923 --> 00:29:25.072
Put the gun down

419
00:29:25.109 --> 00:29:26.222
Say I love America!

420
00:29:26.259 --> 00:29:27.437
I love America,

421
00:29:27.473 --> 00:29:28.396
Please don't kill me,

422
00:29:28.432 --> 00:29:29.851
Sing the national anthem,

423
00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:34.271
Not that one, man, sing the American one,

424
00:29:34.308 --> 00:29:35.482
I don't know it.

425
00:30:19.335 --> 00:30:21.316
Wait right here George,

426
00:30:34.872 --> 00:30:37.317
Hulala! Lee,

427
00:30:37.353 --> 00:30:40.836
Carter, stay focust! We're
looking for Jon Pierre,

428
00:30:41.045 --> 00:30:44.652
Let's split up, I'll take the woman.

429
00:31:08.446 --> 00:31:11.240
Carter, James Carter

430
00:31:16.578 --> 00:31:19.170
I know you probably dont
understand a word I'm saying...

431
00:31:19.207 --> 00:31:23.085
but I gotta tell you, you're the most
beautiful woman I ever seen in my life.

432
00:31:23.121 --> 00:31:26.755
And I like to strip you down and butter
you like a slice of wonder bread,

433
00:31:27.756 --> 00:31:30.885
And shave your arm pits, and put
honey all over your naked body,

434
00:31:30.921 --> 00:31:34.781
And for the next two or three weeks
I wouldn't get hungry there,

435
00:31:34.817 --> 00:31:38.642
Well, James Carter, I happend
to speak 6 lauguages.

436
00:31:39.309 --> 00:31:40.936
Is one of'm english?

437
00:31:41.394 --> 00:31:43.438
Are you in or not?

438
00:31:47.734 --> 00:31:49.198
Money plays,

439
00:31:49.235 --> 00:31:51.738
Sir, it's a 1000 Euros minimum.

440
00:31:51.905 --> 00:31:53.197
How much I'm short?

441
00:31:53.234 --> 00:31:54.782
930 Euros,

442
00:31:55.783 --> 00:31:58.870
It's okay, let him play.

443
00:31:59.287 --> 00:32:00.621
Thank you,

444
00:32:19.139 --> 00:32:21.433
I'm looking for Jon Pierre,

445
00:32:28.607 --> 00:32:30.984
Maybe I can help you.

446
00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:36.948
Do you know what I hate about cops?

447
00:32:38.408 --> 00:32:40.290
Even when they're with a woman...

448
00:32:40.326 --> 00:32:43.538
they can't stop thinking
about getting their man

449
00:32:43.574 --> 00:32:45.456
Who is Sai Xing?

450
00:32:46.499 --> 00:32:48.501
See what I mean.

451
00:32:49.398 --> 00:32:52.942
Come upstairs, cop I'll
give you what you want.

452
00:32:57.863 --> 00:33:00.365
- Hit Me!
- Mister, this is Baccarat!

453
00:33:00.784 --> 00:33:02.124
I know that,

454
00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.459
You think I don't know
baccarat when i play it?

455
00:33:04.495 --> 00:33:07.165
When I was a kid, my friends and I used to
hang out at a place called magic Johnson...

456
00:33:07.202 --> 00:33:09.876
and we played baccarat all night long.

457
00:33:10.501 --> 00:33:12.670
Now hit me.

458
00:33:18.175 --> 00:33:20.449
Three kings... read'm and weep,

459
00:33:24.598 --> 00:33:28.727
Three kings is a zero, you have the
worst possible hand, you lose

460
00:33:28.764 --> 00:33:30.145
What?

461
00:33:33.524 --> 00:33:37.444
Ahh... Madam has a seven, she wins
100,000 Euros, Bravo...

462
00:33:37.486 --> 00:33:40.155
Mr. Carter, it's a pleasure,
you brought me luck,

463
00:33:40.192 --> 00:33:42.824
I'm not here for some game,

464
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:48.371
Excuse me,

465
00:33:55.878 --> 00:33:59.695
Way to go Lee!
Today my boy becomes a man.

466
00:34:01.592 --> 00:34:03.782
Why are you helping me?

467
00:34:03.818 --> 00:34:05.972
Maybe I'm helping myself,

468
00:34:06.264 --> 00:34:08.182
How do I find Jon Piere?

469
00:34:08.307 --> 00:34:10.392
I see you like to get right to it,

470
00:34:10.559 --> 00:34:13.020
Do you know Shi Xing?

471
00:34:14.021 --> 00:34:16.190
Would you like to know a secret, cop?

472
00:34:16.226 --> 00:34:18.025
Yes, please.

473
00:34:19.151 --> 00:34:21.778
Someone's gonna die here tonight

474
00:34:27.284 --> 00:34:28.660
And it's you!

475
00:35:08.532 --> 00:35:10.972
Come on buster, you don't hide

476
00:35:25.215 --> 00:35:26.612
Do it, Lee,

477
00:35:26.648 --> 00:35:28.009
Tear that ass up!

478
00:35:40.522 --> 00:35:42.608
- You are a super freak!
- Carter!

479
00:35:53.825 --> 00:35:54.832
Sorry!

480
00:35:54.869 --> 00:35:56.495
- You got a boy friend?
- Carter!

481
00:35:58.705 --> 00:36:00.123
Start that truck!

482
00:36:00.373 --> 00:36:01.646
Go on!

483
00:36:01.683 --> 00:36:02.918
Drive, fast!

484
00:36:23.834 --> 00:36:26.253
Carter, look!

485
00:36:26.796 --> 00:36:29.298
George, we need you to go faster, man.

486
00:36:29.334 --> 00:36:30.554
No, forget it,

487
00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:33.052
You want to kill me
then go ahead, kill me,

488
00:36:34.303 --> 00:36:36.012
Drive faster!

489
00:36:38.556 --> 00:36:40.230
Please, I'm scared

490
00:36:40.267 --> 00:36:42.399
- George, you watch American movies?
- Yeah

491
00:36:42.435 --> 00:36:45.647
Okay, man, alright,
listen, you're a superspy,

492
00:36:45.684 --> 00:36:47.399
A superspy!

493
00:36:48.379 --> 00:36:51.589
- Now drive this can, come on.
- Okay.

494
00:36:53.384 --> 00:36:55.469
I'm a superspy.

495
00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:09.107
Oh, George, go!

496
00:37:13.611 --> 00:37:16.739
George, when I tell you to,
hit the breaks!

497
00:37:19.556 --> 00:37:20.285
NOW!

498
00:37:26.499 --> 00:37:27.958
Oh my god! Lee!

499
00:37:32.546 --> 00:37:34.298
Back up!

500
00:37:46.726 --> 00:37:48.686
Way to go, George!

501
00:37:51.606 --> 00:37:53.191
It's okay.

502
00:38:09.103 --> 00:38:10.979
I got this one!

503
00:38:15.066 --> 00:38:16.443
Oh my leg!

504
00:38:18.653 --> 00:38:20.446
Lee, help!

505
00:38:31.895 --> 00:38:34.001
Hold him down!

506
00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.803
Lee!

507
00:38:51.101 --> 00:38:54.438
This is not my fight!
This is not...

508
00:38:57.232 --> 00:39:01.737
Lee, my... my whole
life flashed in front of me.

509
00:39:01.773 --> 00:39:03.697
In 3 years i've been married to
this American Chinese woman,

510
00:39:03.733 --> 00:39:06.658
we had 3 kids, they just looked like you.
Only they're adopted...

511
00:39:06.971 --> 00:39:08.181
- Carter!
- What?

512
00:39:08.321 --> 00:39:10.954
- Put your hands up,
- What're talking about!

513
00:39:11.287 --> 00:39:12.914
Whou!

514
00:39:30.827 --> 00:39:36.749
Some people say the modern wall was invented
when the French built these sewers,

515
00:39:36.786 --> 00:39:39.836
10 million gallons pumped
through every hour,

516
00:39:40.045 --> 00:39:42.463
A marvel that no one ever sees,

517
00:39:43.631 --> 00:39:45.342
Welcome to Paris, Lee.

518
00:39:45.378 --> 00:39:47.015
Lee, you know this guy?

519
00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:49.595
Go on, Lee, tell him who I am...

520
00:39:49.632 --> 00:39:51.055
Don't be shy...

521
00:39:51.388 --> 00:39:53.641
Introduce him to your Xiong Di,

522
00:39:53.678 --> 00:39:55.898
Xiong Di? Your brother!

523
00:39:55.935 --> 00:39:57.483
He doesn't talk about me much...

524
00:39:57.519 --> 00:40:01.023
In fact, he's spend his
whole life trying to forget me,

525
00:40:01.059 --> 00:40:03.689
How would it look if Hong Kong's
great Inspector Lee...

526
00:40:03.725 --> 00:40:06.320
had a brother on the
wrong side of the law?

527
00:40:06.612 --> 00:40:08.952
You're not my brother anymore,

528
00:40:08.989 --> 00:40:10.824
Are you forgetting about Chenzhou?

529
00:40:10.861 --> 00:40:11.601
Yes, i forgot,

530
00:40:11.638 --> 00:40:14.729
You spared my life in Los Angeles,

531
00:40:14.765 --> 00:40:18.916
You could have shot me in that
alley. But you didn't pull the trigger.

532
00:40:18.952 --> 00:40:21.173
Because you can't escape your past.

533
00:40:21.209 --> 00:40:24.254
I didn't kill you because
I'm not an assasin.

534
00:40:24.291 --> 00:40:26.923
Let me repay the favor, Lee,

535
00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:29.514
I allow you to live...

536
00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:31.183
if you promise to leave Paris tonight.

537
00:40:31.219 --> 00:40:33.763
You got yourself a deal...
thank you for showing us the sewer,

538
00:40:34.138 --> 00:40:36.808
listen, that's a bad ass suit,
let's get the hell out of here

539
00:40:36.844 --> 00:40:39.432
What about Han and his daughter?

540
00:40:39.468 --> 00:40:42.021
There's nothing i can do for them.

541
00:40:42.271 --> 00:40:43.695
I have no choice.

542
00:40:43.731 --> 00:40:45.196
Then I have no choice.

543
00:40:45.232 --> 00:40:48.193
I guess he's staying, who wants
to take me to the airport?

544
00:40:50.488 --> 00:40:52.906
We're always be brothers, Lee,

545
00:40:53.198 --> 00:40:55.785
In this life and the next.

546
00:40:59.371 --> 00:41:02.040
Tell me, Kenji, who is Shi Xing?

547
00:41:02.666 --> 00:41:05.293
Some secrets are worth dying for,

548
00:41:07.545 --> 00:41:09.506
Hold it, alright, okay,

549
00:41:10.632 --> 00:41:13.176
Lee, what the hell is going on?

550
00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:31.819
Shit, man, it's locked!

551
00:41:31.855 --> 00:41:32.992
Over here,

552
00:41:33.028 --> 00:41:34.447
We've got to jump!

553
00:41:36.991 --> 00:41:39.117
Oh, it's a sewer, man, hell no Lee

554
00:41:39.326 --> 00:41:40.953
- No choice
- I rather die

555
00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:42.204
Come on!

556
00:41:53.423 --> 00:41:55.509
I'm gonna kill you, Lee!

557
00:42:03.808 --> 00:42:07.145
Welcome to the Patacy Inn,
how may I help you?

558
00:42:07.521 --> 00:42:12.003
- Its great to see you again, its been to long.
- Yes, far to long Sir.

559
00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:15.862
Listen, I need a big suite, two beds,
two showers...

560
00:42:15.863 --> 00:42:19.407
a massage therepist, some new clothes,
and a case of Old Spice.

561
00:42:20.992 --> 00:42:24.661
That's all your fault, how come
you didn't tell me about Kenji?

562
00:42:26.367 --> 00:42:28.290
It was none of your business.

563
00:42:28.666 --> 00:42:32.300
In case you missed it man,
he was trying to kill me.

564
00:42:32.336 --> 00:42:36.340
I'm covered in shit, and some french cops
whooped my ass with yellow pages, man.

565
00:42:36.673 --> 00:42:38.305
So don't tell me it's none of my business.

566
00:42:38.341 --> 00:42:41.511
You're lucky, we're not in Hong Kong,
phonebook is twice as big.

567
00:42:41.548 --> 00:42:43.888
Why didn't you tell me
you had a brother man?

568
00:42:46.725 --> 00:42:52.147
Oh, hell, no... lady, your
damn dog just pissed on me.

569
00:42:53.356 --> 00:42:55.108
Good girl.

570
00:42:58.028 --> 00:43:02.156
Do you know what I think?
I think you feel sorry for this guy.

571
00:43:03.574 --> 00:43:05.994
Maybe Kenji didn't get away in LA

572
00:43:07.578 --> 00:43:09.747
Maybe you let him go.

573
00:43:09.955 --> 00:43:14.752
The Aqusa killed his family in Tokyo.
He was send to China when he was seven.

574
00:43:14.788 --> 00:43:19.715
He was put in Ching Zhou at the orphanage
where I was.

575
00:43:19.924 --> 00:43:21.430
We kept each other alive.

576
00:43:21.466 --> 00:43:24.553
You protected each other,
and you still protect him.

577
00:43:25.763 --> 00:43:28.807
I called him Xiong Di,
he was like my brother.

578
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:33.770
- And then, I left him.
- You was adopted, what choice did you have?

579
00:43:34.562 --> 00:43:39.192
He headed out on the streets.
You could never understand.

580
00:43:39.734 --> 00:43:41.574
I understand man, I got a brother,

581
00:43:41.611 --> 00:43:44.614
My little Brother Perry, we used to be
best friends, now we don't speak.

582
00:43:44.651 --> 00:43:47.617
He thinks I took the cops out by
his chicken fights in his garage?

583
00:43:47.653 --> 00:43:50.000
Do you believe that? My own
brother thinks I'm a snitch.

584
00:43:50.036 --> 00:43:53.539
Just because my chicken lost, in the
semi finals, I'm even a kid... - Carter!

585
00:43:53.576 --> 00:43:56.131
I had it fixed, we can find the
chicken and still make it's way.

586
00:43:56.167 --> 00:43:59.962
And it still went the distance, it had
a lot'a heart, and it was delicious.

587
00:43:59.998 --> 00:44:03.471
It's best if I do this on my own.
This fight is personal.

588
00:44:03.508 --> 00:44:06.718
Let me help you, man, I'm telling you, what
ever the kid's telling you, it ain't true,

589
00:44:06.755 --> 00:44:09.680
- He ain't your brother.
- And you're not my brother.

590
00:44:13.371 --> 00:44:17.375
Fine, I'm not your brother.

591
00:45:10.259 --> 00:45:17.516
Yes... I would like to order some fried chicken
please, oh, and some sweet potato pie, Merci.

592
00:45:18.809 --> 00:45:21.937
Enjoy your Mushu Sir.
- Thank you. - Good bye.

593
00:46:19.409 --> 00:46:21.953
- Oh...
- Hello Inspector.

594
00:46:22.245 --> 00:46:26.708
- Hi, Mr. Raynard.
- They want to kill me, may I come in?

595
00:46:26.875 --> 00:46:29.962
A dozend agent from the French secret
police have already been murdered...

596
00:46:29.964 --> 00:46:34.632
only this last month, we're at war with
the Triads, right here in my own city.

597
00:46:34.841 --> 00:46:36.306
Who is Shi Xing?

598
00:46:36.343 --> 00:46:40.762
Ah, Sha Xing, Sha Xing is not a person, it's a list.
- A list?

599
00:46:40.763 --> 00:46:47.228
Yes, every five years, the Triad bosses
come togather for an election.

600
00:46:47.264 --> 00:46:51.941
And during that ceremony, they'll
choose the man who will lead the Triads.

601
00:46:51.977 --> 00:46:53.567
Dragon Heads.

602
00:46:53.604 --> 00:46:54.359
Yes,

603
00:46:54.505 --> 00:47:00.287
13 Dragon Heads who control the largest criminal
organization in the world. And the 13 names, are...

604
00:47:00.288 --> 00:47:08.290
inscribe on the list known as Sha Xing, a secret
that's been handed down from generation to generation.

605
00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:12.961
If the names from that
list, will ever to get out.

606
00:47:12.997 --> 00:47:16.089
The secret society wouldn't
be so secret anymore.

607
00:47:16.126 --> 00:47:18.651
They would all be ending
up in jail or dead.

608
00:47:18.687 --> 00:47:21.141
And the list is some where in Paris?

609
00:47:21.178 --> 00:47:24.931
A young lady named Generieve,
made contact with Ambassador Han,

610
00:47:25.598 --> 00:47:28.331
And we belief she know where it is.

611
00:47:30.478 --> 00:47:33.236
I'm asking for your help, Inspector.

612
00:47:33.272 --> 00:47:37.360
Finish what Ambassador Han started. Get to the
girl, before the Triads do, and you get (?).

613
00:48:21.402 --> 00:48:27.585
- I don't know such, who are you?
- Who am I? I'm Bubbles, your new costume designer.

614
00:48:27.586 --> 00:48:32.747
- Has anyone seen Goldie Hayes?
- She's has her own dressing room.

615
00:48:35.791 --> 00:48:39.795
Wait... Bubbles, do we look ok?

616
00:48:51.223 --> 00:48:56.957
No, no, no, these costumes are terrible.
Ladies please, we have work to do.

617
00:49:35.954 --> 00:49:40.499
1st, I would dress the Blonde's...

618
00:49:45.859 --> 00:49:49.884
and then the Brunnett's...

619
00:49:53.053 --> 00:49:59.267
and finaly the highritz...

620
00:50:02.438 --> 00:50:05.524
the Lord has truely blessed you all...

621
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:10.841
Would I mean this... trust me...

622
00:50:10.842 --> 00:50:19.182
and some of you have what I like
to call... silver dollar potential.

623
00:50:41.204 --> 00:50:44.123
- Lee, what're you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

624
00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:47.043
- I found Generieve.
- So did I, they're trying to kill her.

625
00:50:47.419 --> 00:50:49.379
- What?
- Look.

626
00:50:54.676 --> 00:50:57.094
- Lee, you get the lights, I get the girl.
- Go.

627
00:52:08.204 --> 00:52:11.297
- Your life is in danger!
- What the hell is going on?

628
00:52:11.298 --> 00:52:15.044
You step into that spot light, it's the
last step you ever gonna take,

629
00:52:15.712 --> 00:52:19.069
- They're gonna kill you right now!
- Who are you?

630
00:52:23.512 --> 00:52:25.492
James Carter, L.A.P.D.

631
00:52:26.015 --> 00:52:29.142
Sorry James, It's time for my solo

632
00:54:00.001 --> 00:54:01.961
Get your hands off of me!

633
00:54:23.585 --> 00:54:27.402
- Taxi! Taxi!
- Get in,

634
00:54:27.403 --> 00:54:28.840
Go, go, go!

635
00:54:33.053 --> 00:54:36.389
I've been looking for you all
day, my friend, we need to talk,

636
00:54:36.426 --> 00:54:38.470
Forget it George, we're not paying
for any damages

637
00:54:38.642 --> 00:54:40.566
Oh, no, no, no,
I don't want you to pay...

638
00:54:40.602 --> 00:54:43.813
I want to ask, if I can drive for
you full time, no charge,

639
00:54:43.849 --> 00:54:45.023
Why you want to drive for us?

640
00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:46.822
Today was amazing,

641
00:54:46.858 --> 00:54:50.779
The guns, the shooting, now I understand
what it is to be an American,

642
00:54:50.815 --> 00:54:53.781
Please, I'm begging you,
let me be your driver!

643
00:54:53.818 --> 00:54:56.247
Let me kill someone tonight!

644
00:54:56.283 --> 00:55:00.496
- You never be American ok?
- I'll drink this shit all day if I have to

645
00:55:00.705 --> 00:55:01.961
Just give me a chance,

646
00:55:01.997 --> 00:55:04.292
Alright, fine, get us to the plaza fast

647
00:55:04.328 --> 00:55:06.210
You got it, boss

648
00:55:06.247 --> 00:55:07.711
Hold on!

649
00:55:16.721 --> 00:55:19.348
So you think, she stole the
Sha Xing list from the Triad?

650
00:55:19.384 --> 00:55:21.054
Only one way to find out!

651
00:55:21.091 --> 00:55:23.181
You think what I'm thinking?

652
00:55:23.217 --> 00:55:25.234
We need her to talk! Get her relaxed!

653
00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:27.647
We can get some
wine from the mini bar

654
00:55:31.233 --> 00:55:34.361
Maybe we should put on a dirty movie,

655
00:55:34.362 --> 00:55:35.410
Lee!

656
00:55:35.447 --> 00:55:36.761
Only 9.95!

657
00:55:36.844 --> 00:55:39.284
This is our chance to find Sha Xing!

658
00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:40.873
I'm going in!

659
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:42.334
What's wrong with you?

660
00:55:42.370 --> 00:55:48.626
- Wait, let me go with you!
- Something's a man has do on his own,

661
00:55:54.652 --> 00:55:56.243
You ok?

662
00:55:56.279 --> 00:55:58.281
Can't mister, figure out what I have done?

663
00:55:58.318 --> 00:56:00.116
I'm as good as dead!

664
00:56:00.117 --> 00:56:04.288
You stole the list didn't you
you tryed to sell it to Han?

665
00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:07.687
You don't get it!

666
00:56:07.723 --> 00:56:09.542
I'm one of them!

667
00:56:09.751 --> 00:56:12.211
And If I'm dead, you're dead!

668
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:21.012
Hey!

669
00:56:21.637 --> 00:56:25.432
We're safe, no one know
we're here, just relax!

670
00:56:26.725 --> 00:56:28.686
No one is safe,

671
00:56:29.103 --> 00:56:30.604
I'm marked!

672
00:56:30.896 --> 00:56:32.027
Trust me!

673
00:56:32.063 --> 00:56:33.587
Why should I trust you?

674
00:56:33.623 --> 00:56:35.109
As the Chinese say...

675
00:56:38.111 --> 00:56:39.112
What does that mean?

676
00:56:39.905 --> 00:56:43.241
A donkeys lips will not
fit on a horses mouth,

677
00:56:44.492 --> 00:56:47.079
I'm not sure I can relax,

678
00:56:47.871 --> 00:56:50.373
Well, I was, thinking!

679
00:56:50.748 --> 00:56:53.543
You have nice lips, that's all,

680
00:56:56.254 --> 00:56:59.257
You safed my life today,
thank you, Carter!

681
00:56:59.632 --> 00:57:02.051
Oh, please, call me james,

682
00:57:03.886 --> 00:57:06.639
No one safed me in a long time!

683
00:57:06.973 --> 00:57:08.745
How can I repay you!

684
00:57:08.782 --> 00:57:10.517
You have 20 Bucks?

685
00:57:13.104 --> 00:57:14.688
How about ten?

686
00:57:18.276 --> 00:57:19.240
What?

687
00:57:19.276 --> 00:57:21.487
I'm bad too - I'm a
bad girl - Haleluya

688
00:57:38.086 --> 00:57:41.005
Don't you want to?
My nipples are sensitive be careful.

689
00:57:42.924 --> 00:57:44.926
- I've never been with an American man before,
- Neither have I,

690
00:57:44.927 --> 00:57:45.970
I feel so safe with you,

691
00:57:47.512 --> 00:57:48.929
Do you want me?

692
00:57:49.513 --> 00:57:52.856
- Once or twice and once in the shower,
- Oh yeah?

693
00:57:52.892 --> 00:57:56.353
I'm going to bathroom,
make myself more comfortable,

694
00:57:59.398 --> 00:58:01.942
Don't move, I'll be right back!

695
00:58:05.029 --> 00:58:09.533
Hello, room service?
Get me a bottle of Honey and some RedBull,

696
00:58:38.311 --> 00:58:39.776

697
00:58:39.812 --> 00:58:42.482
No wonderland is all soked and
all the way here to ride a bike...

698
00:58:42.815 --> 00:58:44.650
Thank you,

699
00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:53.408
Wait, baby, wait!

700
00:59:04.211 --> 00:59:06.046
Oh yeah!

701
00:59:11.051 --> 00:59:13.011
Freeze, don't move!

702
00:59:14.888 --> 00:59:16.264
Damn!

703
00:59:23.438 --> 00:59:25.231
- I'm sorry
- It's ok...

704
00:59:25.267 --> 00:59:26.273
I'm ok!

705
00:59:31.529 --> 00:59:33.787
So, we're even now, huh? Is that it?

706
00:59:33.823 --> 00:59:35.324
I shoot your girl You shoot my girl

707
00:59:35.658 --> 00:59:37.164
I tryed to save your life,

708
00:59:37.201 --> 00:59:41.101
Couldn't you wait 5 minutes, we started
makeing love, man, and you ruined it

709
00:59:41.137 --> 00:59:43.895
They will be coming for us, we
have to get out of here, now!

710
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:45.318
You see that?

711
00:59:45.354 --> 00:59:47.190
We got to get out of here now, damn!

712
00:59:47.227 --> 00:59:48.253
Lee, damn you!

713
00:59:48.274 --> 00:59:50.026
Next time, I'll get my own damn room!

714
00:59:53.050 --> 00:59:55.887
They have a problem! Get them out!
George! These people are dangeres,

715
00:59:59.410 --> 01:00:02.163
There is something you should know

716
01:00:02.199 --> 01:00:04.831
I'm not what you think I am!

717
01:00:05.333 --> 01:00:07.710
Are you telling me, you're gay?

718
01:00:11.881 --> 01:00:15.050
I'm try to tell you, I'm American spy

719
01:00:16.343 --> 01:00:17.641
You're a spy?

720
01:00:17.677 --> 01:00:20.722
Yeah, I'm working undercover with the
police we're about to break a big case!

721
01:00:20.806 --> 01:00:26.520
Shut your mouth, George, you're nothing more then a
cab driver, just like your father was a cab driver,

722
01:00:26.521 --> 01:00:27.940
What Kind of case could you crack,

723
01:00:28.521 --> 01:00:30.565
Can't talk about it!

724
01:00:31.858 --> 01:00:33.406
From this moment on!

725
01:00:33.443 --> 01:00:36.445
Don't ever ask me, about my business!

726
01:00:37.071 --> 01:00:38.490
Come with me, shmuck!

727
01:00:38.526 --> 01:00:39.949
Now!

728
01:00:45.184 --> 01:00:46.565
We need to get out of the city

729
01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:48.812
We're not going anywhere,
untill you tell us exactly...

730
01:00:48.848 --> 01:00:51.185
what's going on? Did you steal
that list from the Triats?

731
01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:54.776
Generieve... we can not help you,
until you tell us the truth...

732
01:00:54.812 --> 01:00:56.945
where is Sha Xing?

733
01:00:58.738 --> 01:01:00.365
It's right here!

734
01:01:01.949 --> 01:01:03.368
Holly mother Jesus! She's a Man!

735
01:01:03.618 --> 01:01:07.538
I went to second base, with a damn
Frenchmen, It's a crying game

736
01:01:08.455 --> 01:01:10.166
I broke my par!

737
01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:12.210
I'm not the man, it's just a wig,

738
01:01:12.246 --> 01:01:14.211
You sure about that?

739
01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:15.922
Lee, go on check out her hardware

740
01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:19.426
If she's got anything in her bag, bigger
then a 3 iron, I'm gonna beat his ass,

741
01:01:19.717 --> 01:01:22.637
I'm a women, James, a women who needs
a way out... you have to help me,

742
01:01:23.846 --> 01:01:24.805
You have Sha Xing?

743
01:01:24.842 --> 01:01:26.139
No!

744
01:01:26.431 --> 01:01:28.141
I'm Sha Xing!

745
01:01:35.607 --> 01:01:39.486
In the ancient time, when
the Triads selected new leaders,

746
01:01:39.522 --> 01:01:42.698
They would secretly tatoo the
names on to a women...

747
01:01:43.823 --> 01:01:49.204
A women, who can carry the list of
Sha Xing, to the 35 borders of China

748
01:01:49.454 --> 01:01:52.915
When the journey ended, and
the new leader was found...

749
01:01:52.952 --> 01:01:55.919
the women would be beheaded,
and burried forever,

750
01:01:56.211 --> 01:01:58.504
No records, no witness...

751
01:01:58.754 --> 01:02:00.511
What the hell kind of tradition is that?

752
01:02:00.547 --> 01:02:03.155
Have these guys never heard
of a goddamn fax machine?

753
01:02:03.191 --> 01:02:05.761
Kenji told me do it, he
said it was a great honor.

754
01:02:05.797 --> 01:02:07.764
I wanted to do it for him.

755
01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:08.895
For the brotherhood.

756
01:02:08.931 --> 01:02:10.521
Then why did you send
the names to Hun?

757
01:02:10.557 --> 01:02:13.101
Because I thought the world
court could protect me.

758
01:02:13.138 --> 01:02:14.600
But now I see.

759
01:02:14.637 --> 01:02:16.026
Nobody can.

760
01:02:16.063 --> 01:02:18.231
You're mixed up in some weird shit, lady.

761
01:02:18.268 --> 01:02:20.401
I mean, man, whatever the hell you are.

762
01:02:20.437 --> 01:02:21.615
I'm a woman.

763
01:02:21.652 --> 01:02:24.112
And they will send an army to
kill me. To protect their way.

764
01:02:24.654 --> 01:02:26.990
You know what? We can't
fight no army, Lee.

765
01:02:27.027 --> 01:02:29.409
Who can protect me? I mean us.

766
01:02:30.035 --> 01:02:32.453
I know a place.

767
01:02:40.837 --> 01:02:43.506
I won't be here when
you come out. I'm sorry.

768
01:02:43.542 --> 01:02:45.483
My wife says I can't be a spy.

769
01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:48.142
And I have to be home for dinner.

770
01:02:48.178 --> 01:02:50.763
Truth is I'm a cab driver. Nothing more.

771
01:02:50.971 --> 01:02:52.765
This is my destiny.

772
01:02:52.974 --> 01:02:55.538
I will never know what
it's like to be an American.

773
01:02:55.575 --> 01:02:58.103
Never know what it feels
like to kill for no reason.

774
01:02:58.312 --> 01:03:00.272
George, it's okay.

775
01:03:00.773 --> 01:03:01.940
Thank you.

776
01:03:04.151 --> 01:03:06.424
- And good luck.
- Good luck.

777
01:03:15.933 --> 01:03:17.267
Mr. Raynard.

778
01:03:18.749 --> 01:03:21.126
We have it.

779
01:03:22.377 --> 01:03:24.713
The Sha Xing list, it's incredible.

780
01:03:24.749 --> 01:03:27.012
Some people said it was a myth.

781
01:03:27.048 --> 01:03:31.845
No, it's no myth, I've seen it, felt it,
kissed it, but I didn't french kiss it.

782
01:03:31.881 --> 01:03:33.721
You do understand how dangerous this is.

783
01:03:33.758 --> 01:03:35.389
We could always use some protection.

784
01:03:35.426 --> 01:03:36.750
Can we go to the police?

785
01:03:36.786 --> 01:03:39.456
The Triads control to many of them.

786
01:03:39.748 --> 01:03:41.750
We have to get you out of the country.

787
01:03:42.855 --> 01:03:44.279
Now my dear.

788
01:03:44.315 --> 01:03:46.567
Would you mind taking off that wig...

789
01:03:46.568 --> 01:03:48.490
and showing us Sha Xing.

790
01:03:48.527 --> 01:03:51.364
We never told him that she was the list.

791
01:03:55.992 --> 01:03:57.661
Look at that.

792
01:03:57.953 --> 01:04:01.539
13 names and things, through
centuries of tradition.

793
01:04:01.831 --> 01:04:05.043
The only real proof that
a secret world exists.

794
01:04:08.172 --> 01:04:10.258
Shut her up

795
01:04:13.051 --> 01:04:14.635
Get their guns.

796
01:04:24.645 --> 01:04:27.064
I told you he was
bad, didn't I tell you?

797
01:04:28.441 --> 01:04:31.193
Well, I was thinking it,
the explosion at the embassy.

798
01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:33.695
As head of the world criminal court,

799
01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:35.156
it would make sense
for me to be a target.

800
01:04:35.192 --> 01:04:36.746
Why did you come to my room?

801
01:04:36.782 --> 01:04:38.706
Geneviere was going to be killed.

802
01:04:38.742 --> 01:04:43.038
Having you die in the crossfire
would put an end to the investigation.

803
01:04:43.205 --> 01:04:46.083
Now, it will end another way.

804
01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:48.841
It's over, Reynard.

805
01:04:48.877 --> 01:04:51.213
You know what it's like
to be an old man in prison?

806
01:04:51.249 --> 01:04:52.719
They call you pops.

807
01:04:52.756 --> 01:04:54.654
They make you work in the library.

808
01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:56.551
Your best friend, s'gonna be a mouse.

809
01:04:59.178 --> 01:05:01.473
I'm not going to prison.

810
01:05:01.848 --> 01:05:04.267
You have a phone call, Inspector.

811
01:05:10.148 --> 01:05:11.774
Hello, brother.

812
01:05:12.316 --> 01:05:14.277
I'd like to make a trade.

813
01:05:14.652 --> 01:05:18.239
Some friends of mine came across
something in the Los Angeles.

814
01:05:18.275 --> 01:05:20.116
Something very valuable.

815
01:05:22.243 --> 01:05:23.452
Lee.

816
01:05:23.619 --> 01:05:25.537
Help me please.

817
01:05:28.332 --> 01:05:30.250
Do we understand each other?

818
01:05:30.287 --> 01:05:31.335
What do you want?

819
01:05:31.371 --> 01:05:32.753
Sha Xing.

820
01:05:33.129 --> 01:05:36.089
You and Geneviere will
meet me alone tonight.

821
01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:38.883
If I see you with any other cops...

822
01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:40.719
the girl dies.

823
01:05:41.261 --> 01:05:42.471
Where?

824
01:05:42.721 --> 01:05:45.014
Jules Vaugh Restaurant.

825
01:05:45.181 --> 01:05:46.767
Midnight.

826
01:05:46.934 --> 01:05:49.144
Don't be late.

827
01:06:21.842 --> 01:06:24.720
He brought the girl.
Send the elevator down.

828
01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:59.920
Welcome to the party, Lee.

829
01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:03.987
Tonight we celebrate
the return of Sha Xing...

830
01:07:04.024 --> 01:07:06.281
and the return of my brother.

831
01:07:07.115 --> 01:07:08.992
Where is Soo Yung.

832
01:07:25.382 --> 01:07:27.348
This sword has a past.

833
01:07:27.384 --> 01:07:31.222
Unlike our world, it has
seen much pain, much blood.

834
01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:38.604
Hundreds of years ago, the
Triads would kill their enemies...

835
01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.814
with 100 cuts to the body.

836
01:07:41.148 --> 01:07:44.568
They would be very careful
to avoid any major arteries...

837
01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:48.530
so that the victim would stay
alive for as long as possible.

838
01:07:49.406 --> 01:07:53.326
You have just experience
to your first cut.

839
01:07:54.202 --> 01:07:56.746
If anything happens to Soo Yung...

840
01:07:57.747 --> 01:07:59.957
You can never kill me, Lee.

841
01:08:00.207 --> 01:08:01.923
We both know that.

842
01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:03.383
You know nothing about me.

843
01:08:03.419 --> 01:08:07.465
I know you have no wife.
No children. No family.

844
01:08:08.341 --> 01:08:11.343
Your life ended when you
were a kid back in Chenjo.

845
01:08:17.182 --> 01:08:20.228
You have nothing... just like me.

846
01:08:21.395 --> 01:08:23.355
I wouldn't say nothing.

847
01:08:27.651 --> 01:08:29.611
He has me.

848
01:08:30.195 --> 01:08:32.615
His brother from another mother.

849
01:08:38.307 --> 01:08:39.997
Where is she?

850
01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:41.685
Enjoy the view.

851
01:08:45.481 --> 01:08:46.857
Soo Yung.

852
01:08:47.233 --> 01:08:48.650
Help me.

853
01:08:53.739 --> 01:08:54.953
Let her go.

854
01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:56.866
What the hell is wrong with you?

855
01:08:56.903 --> 01:08:58.577
Do you wanna die, Kenji?

856
01:08:58.614 --> 01:09:00.412
Get her in here,

857
01:09:00.787 --> 01:09:02.544
Carter, drop the gun,

858
01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:05.709
Get off that damn brother, or I'll
shoot you and the damn temptations

859
01:09:05.917 --> 01:09:07.168
Right now!

860
01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:16.177
- Do it!
- Put her down, I'm serious

861
01:09:18.179 --> 01:09:19.931
I'm not playing, you ain't my damn brother

862
01:09:22.308 --> 01:09:24.894
Kenji - Drop
the gun. - No!

863
01:09:25.436 --> 01:09:27.188
Drop it, Carter!

864
01:09:27.688 --> 01:09:29.106
Shit

865
01:09:33.278 --> 01:09:37.449
Tonight I lose a brother.

866
01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.456
Get'm, man!

867
01:09:48.041 --> 01:09:50.169
I'm gonna kick your ass, Kenji,

868
01:10:01.721 --> 01:10:04.495
Come on, kill him already!

869
01:10:12.148 --> 01:10:15.025
He might be your brother,
but turned out to be your sister,

870
01:10:45.972 --> 01:10:47.808
Give me your hand,

871
01:11:03.155 --> 01:11:05.240
Lee... Lee!

872
01:11:05.242 --> 01:11:06.701
Jesus!

873
01:11:07.493 --> 01:11:09.495
Hold on, I'm coming!

874
01:11:36.667 --> 01:11:37.751
Lee!

875
01:13:08.005 --> 01:13:09.757
Enough, Kenji!

876
01:13:46.417 --> 01:13:49.337
Everybody comes for kungfu fighting.

877
01:13:51.630 --> 01:13:53.508
Soo Yung?

878
01:14:07.271 --> 01:14:10.190
What're you waiting for? Do it!

879
01:14:22.661 --> 01:14:27.249
- Let go! We're both gonna die
- No, I can save you

880
01:14:37.591 --> 01:14:40.094
- Good bye, Lee
- No, Kenji

881
01:14:44.369 --> 01:14:46.330
Nooo...!

882
01:15:16.441 --> 01:15:18.361
I'm coming Soo Yung!

883
01:15:23.156 --> 01:15:24.783
My God,

884
01:15:34.626 --> 01:15:35.924
Stay cool lady!

885
01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:38.130
It doesn't have to end this way,

886
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:40.757
Don't do it... don't do it lady,

887
01:15:41.382 --> 01:15:43.176
Don't you do it

888
01:15:43.885 --> 01:15:46.221
Think about what you're doing?

889
01:15:48.785 --> 01:15:50.683
Hey... Hey!

890
01:15:51.392 --> 01:15:53.811
Would you like to know a secret?

891
01:15:54.061 --> 01:15:55.229
No...

892
01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:01.401
No!

893
01:16:39.021 --> 01:16:41.524
- Lee, So Yung is up here,
- Soo Yung,

894
01:16:44.026 --> 01:16:45.402
I'm ok.

895
01:16:48.114 --> 01:16:49.282
Shit!

896
01:17:49.089 --> 01:17:50.507
Yeah!

897
01:18:05.147 --> 01:18:07.190
Lee, Reel me in,

898
01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:09.588
Black people don't fly,

899
01:18:10.256 --> 01:18:11.674
Pull... Pull it,

900
01:18:14.530 --> 01:18:16.804
Lee! Get me out of here,

901
01:18:26.417 --> 01:18:29.315
Thank you, Lee,

902
01:18:34.967 --> 01:18:36.719
God...

903
01:18:56.738 --> 01:18:58.323
Lee I'll kill you, when we get down...

904
01:19:05.496 --> 01:19:07.123
Hang on!

905
01:19:18.717 --> 01:19:20.135
I'm drowning

906
01:19:21.554 --> 01:19:23.472
Hang on! Lee!

907
01:19:27.810 --> 01:19:31.813
Carter! - What?
- I'm not constepated anymore,

908
01:19:40.322 --> 01:19:42.240
Put your hand ups!

909
01:19:42.407 --> 01:19:45.389
Genvieve!... Hey man you're the head of
the world court,

910
01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:48.564
What you gonna do shoot us
down like animals?

911
01:19:48.565 --> 01:19:52.291
We're police officer
- Yes, and you two, just killed this girl

912
01:19:52.292 --> 01:19:54.607
Blew her brains out,

913
01:19:56.921 --> 01:19:59.027
Carter!
- Don't do it,

914
01:20:23.301 --> 01:20:30.370
Put the gun down,
- I follow'd you, Case Closed,

915
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:39.650
Good job man, come on!

916
01:20:49.576 --> 01:20:53.314
Hey man, you touch me again
you gonna be dead in the movie,

917
01:20:53.351 --> 01:20:57.626
Congratulation, it appears we finally
broke down the Traits,

918
01:20:57.627 --> 01:21:00.462
We?
- You didn't do shit!

919
01:21:01.921 --> 01:21:05.738
The Americans and the French need to work
together in the spirit of brotherhood...

920
01:21:05.774 --> 01:21:07.406
together we can do anything,

921
01:21:07.489 --> 01:21:09.428
Anything!

922
01:21:09.429 --> 01:21:11.848
Yeah he's right, Lee,
together we can do anything,

923
01:21:11.884 --> 01:21:14.141
You go this way and I go that way,

924
01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:48.717
That right Lee, last 3 years I
study the Ancient teaching of Boody...

925
01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:53.137
Cheese!

926
01:21:57.684 --> 01:21:59.519
What? Oh Freeze!

927
01:22:00.269 --> 01:22:03.523
As soon as she could
bring, the seafood secret

928
01:22:04.730 --> 01:22:07.524
As soon as she could
bring, the seafood secret

929
01:22:12.529 --> 01:22:14.365
The seafood secret

930
01:22:14.782 --> 01:22:20.078
I know seafood, I know secret, secret
see but when everything together
