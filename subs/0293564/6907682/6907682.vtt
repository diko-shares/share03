MAN: What the hell are you doing?

18
00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:38.307
What the hell?!

19
00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:40.559
I didn't tell you to go! Goddamn!

20
00:01:40.643 --> 00:01:42.144
- 2ND MAN: It was him!
- It was you!

21
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.189
Shit! Oh, man!

22
00:01:45.273 --> 00:01:47.233
Ain't nobody Iistenin' today?

23
00:01:47.316 --> 00:01:50.903
Ladies, you just dented
a '81 Cutlass Supreme.

24
00:01:50.987 --> 00:01:52.697
I need to see your license
and registration.

25
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.365
Brother, you OK? You cool?

26
00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:56.951
(Siren wailing)

27
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.626
Ten minutes.
Doors open on my signal.

28
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.169
I'm glad you're here, Lee.

29
00:02:07.253 --> 00:02:09.588
I always feel better with
you watching my back.

30
00:02:09.672 --> 00:02:12.842
I'm just doing my job,
Mr. Ambassador.

31
00:02:12.925 --> 00:02:14.802
Stay close today, Lee.

32
00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:16.053
We're making history.

33
00:02:19.307 --> 00:02:21.767
This is bullshit!
Do you know who I am?

34
00:02:21.851 --> 00:02:24.020
My family owns
half of Rodeo Drive.

35
00:02:24.103 --> 00:02:25.604
Do you know who I am?

36
00:02:25.688 --> 00:02:27.857
Detective James Carter, LAPD.

37
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.734
My family owns half of
Crenshaw Boulevard.

38
00:02:29.817 --> 00:02:30.735
I want a lawyer.

39
00:02:30.818 --> 00:02:32.278
You need a personal trainer.

40
00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:33.654
This license says 180 pounds.

41
00:02:33.738 --> 00:02:35.072
You weigh more than
the damn car, girl.

42
00:02:35.156 --> 00:02:37.491
- I have a thyroid condition.
- Well, stop eating thyroids.

43
00:02:37.575 --> 00:02:41.620
Look, can't you just,
like give us a warning or something?

44
00:02:41.704 --> 00:02:45.207
That depends.
You girls like Chinese?

45

(Cell phone playing <i>California
Girls</i> by the Beach Boys)

46
00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:49.754
- Excuse me.
- (Beep)

47
00:02:49.837 --> 00:02:50.963
(Whispers) Carter.

48
00:02:51.047 --> 00:02:52.548
Lee, we are on for tonight.

49
00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:55.551
I just picked up two girls who wanna
play hide the little Asian policeman.

50
00:02:55.634 --> 00:02:58.262
I can't talk now. I'm in the car
with Ambassador Han.

51
00:02:58.346 --> 00:02:59.972
Trust me, these girls
are sushi grade.

52
00:03:00.056 --> 00:03:02.308
- CARTER: We gotta hit this!
- I have to go. I'm sorry.

53
00:03:02.391 --> 00:03:03.809
CARTER: You're still mad
at me, aren't you?

54
00:03:03.893 --> 00:03:06.228
You're mad because of what happened
when we was in New York.

55
00:03:06.312 --> 00:03:07.313
I don't want to talk about that.

56
00:03:07.396 --> 00:03:09.690
It was three years ago.
When you gonna let it go?

57
00:03:09.774 --> 00:03:12.234
Let it go? Isabella was my girlfriend.

58
00:03:12.318 --> 00:03:13.235
CARTER: Lee, we're friends, man.

59
00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.445
Just come out with me one night.

60
00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:15.529
The mu shu's on me.

61
00:03:16.238 --> 00:03:17.490
- (Beep)
- Lee!

62
00:03:18.824 --> 00:03:20.826
(Exhales)

63
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.036
My mom says hi.

64
00:03:30.294 --> 00:03:33.089
(Protesters chanting, indistinct)

65
00:03:50.022 --> 00:03:53.359
The Chinese triads now have
half a million members...

66
00:03:53.442 --> 00:03:55.861
in over 100 countries.

67
00:03:55.945 --> 00:03:59.573
And these are not street kids
shaking down local merchants.

68
00:03:59.657 --> 00:04:03.911
These are businessmen who have built
a $50 billion empire...

69
00:04:03.994 --> 00:04:07.748
of extortion, drugs, sex and slavery.

70
00:04:07.832 --> 00:04:10.793
We must cut off the head
of this snake...

71
00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:13.087
before it swallows us whole.

72
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.297
As chairman of
the World Criminal Court...

73
00:04:15.381 --> 00:04:19.176
I have entrusted my good friend
Ambassador Han to lead the fight...

74
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.263
against the largest criminal
organization in the world.

75
00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:32.481
- Thank you.
- HAN: Thank you.

76
00:04:36.902 --> 00:04:40.072
Chairman Reynard,
ladies and gentlemen.

77
00:04:42.658 --> 00:04:46.245
The triad society is built on secrecy.

78
00:04:46.328 --> 00:04:50.583
Nobody knows who these men are,
who controls them, who leads them.

79
00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:53.043
Nobody has known for 500 years.

80
00:04:53.127 --> 00:04:56.881
But today, I stand before you
with a secret of my own.

81
00:04:56.964 --> 00:05:01.635
Today, I will disclose information
that affects everyone in this room.

82
00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:06.307
After years of searching,
I believe I've finally located Shy Shen.

83
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.851
- (Chatter)
- Mr. Ambassador...

84
00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:10.728
Shy Shen does not exist.

85
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:13.731
Excuse me, who is this Shy Shen?

86
00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:15.399
HAN: With all due respect, sir, I le--

87
00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:25.451
(Shouting and screaming)

88
00:05:25.534 --> 00:05:27.953
Everybody down!

89
00:05:28.037 --> 00:05:29.580
REYNARD: Call an ambulance!

90
00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:30.706
Someone get a doctor.

91
00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.833
MAN: Ambassador down,
Ambassador down.

92
00:05:32.917 --> 00:05:34.251
Stay with him.

93
00:05:34.335 --> 00:05:36.378

96
00:05:49.225 --> 00:05:50.434
Yugh!

97

(People shouting)

98
00:06:01.237 --> 00:06:03.948
(Sirens, police radio chatter)

99
00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:10.412
Uh-uh-uh. Keepin' these...

100
00:06:10.496 --> 00:06:11.747
- till I see you tonight.
- RADIO: Attention all units...

101
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.332
shots have been fired at the
World Criminal Court building.

102
00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:15.417
The Chinese Ambassador
has been shot.

103
00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:16.919
Chinese Ambassador?
Move your asses over.

104
00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:18.963
- Move over!
- What? Whoa. Shit!

105
00:06:19.046 --> 00:06:21.090
(Tires squeal)

106
00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:39.858

107

00:06:53.372 --> 00:06:55.749
(Tires squealing, horns blaring)

109
00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:00.337
MAN: What're you doing?!

110
00:07:00.421 --> 00:07:01.839
Lee!

111
00:07:03.007 --> 00:07:06.135
(Tires squealing)
(Women screaming)

112
00:07:06.218 --> 00:07:07.720
- Where the hell is he goin'?
- Ah!

113
00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:12.808
LAPD! Get the hell outta the way!

114
00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:14.602
People are crazy.

115
00:07:16.437 --> 00:07:18.564
I'm-a give your ass
a ticket when I come back!

116
00:07:35.831 --> 00:07:38.083
(Horn blaring)
(Women screaming)

117
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:43.756
Lee, I'm comin'!

118
00:07:52.473 --> 00:07:54.183
Ugh!

119
00:07:59.647 --> 00:08:01.273
Don't move!

120
00:08:05.778 --> 00:08:07.613
Hello, Lee.

121
00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:17.414
(Speaking Japanese)

122
00:08:38.477 --> 00:08:41.480
I think we both know
that's not gonna happen.

123
00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:47.611
Kenji!

124
00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:52.032
You see? I know you too well.

125
00:08:52.116 --> 00:08:53.951
(Tires squealing)

126
00:08:56.662 --> 00:08:58.414
Aaaah!

127
00:09:02.918 --> 00:09:04.878
- Ugh!
- WOMAN: Aaaah!

128
00:09:07.423 --> 00:09:09.842
- Ungh.
- CARTER: Lee, you OK?

129
00:09:12.553 --> 00:09:15.139
We almost killed your ass.
Why you didn't move?

130
00:09:15.222 --> 00:09:16.849
Ohh.

131
00:09:16.932 --> 00:09:18.934
I'd like for you to meet
our dates for this evenin'.

132
00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:20.853
Masha and Zoe.

133
00:09:20.936 --> 00:09:21.854
Urgh.

134
00:09:21.937 --> 00:09:23.439
Fat one's yours.

135
00:09:28.819 --> 00:09:31.071
How many times do you
want me to say it? I'm sorry.

136
00:09:31.155 --> 00:09:32.948
I'm sorry I ran you over, man. Damn!

137
00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:34.283
- Not now, Carter.
- Aww.

138
00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:37.286
All right, hold it right there.
Don't say a word, Carter.

139
00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:39.371
Captain Diel,
I had nothin' to do with this.

140
00:09:39.455 --> 00:09:41.540
All I did was borrow a car,
backed up Lee.

141
00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:42.583
Tell him, partner.

142
00:09:42.666 --> 00:09:44.084
I need to see Ambassador Han.

143
00:09:44.168 --> 00:09:46.295
The Ambassador is just out of surgery.

144
00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:48.964
The bullet missed his heart.
He's gonna be OK.

145
00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:50.632
Captain, you have to give
me back my shield...

146
00:09:50.716 --> 00:09:52.509
and put me on this case.
I made one little mistake.

147
00:09:52.593 --> 00:09:54.762
- Take a brother off the bench.
- One little mistake?

148
00:09:54.845 --> 00:09:56.513
You handcuffed two women
and stole their car.

149
00:09:56.597 --> 00:09:58.140
Isn't that why we have insurance?

150
00:09:58.223 --> 00:09:59.850
Everyone has an off day, Captain.

151
00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:02.519
Last month you put six Iranians
in jail for a week!

152
00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:05.147
You and I both know them
Iranians was terrorists.

153
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.357
They were scientists at UCLA!

154
00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:08.484
Big deal.

155
00:10:08.567 --> 00:10:09.860
'Cause they cure cancer in rats...

156
00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:11.779
that doesn't mean
they won't blow shit up.

157
00:10:11.862 --> 00:10:13.489
Let me find the person
who shot Ambassador Han.

158
00:10:13.572 --> 00:10:16.533
Relax, Carter. The LAPD won't be leading
this investigation.

159
00:10:16.617 --> 00:10:18.577
The Ambassador
is my responsibility.

160
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.413
Well, then maybe you could tell me
exactly how that shooter got away.

161
00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:23.749
DIEL: Thought so.

162
00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:27.211
The Ambassador's daughter
is coming to see her father right now.

163
00:10:27.294 --> 00:10:29.171
Make sure nothing happens to her.

164
00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:31.340
Don't worry, Captain,
we're gonna make you proud.

165
00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:33.425
And try not to think about
your wife leaving you.

166
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:34.968
She'll come back.

167
00:10:35.052 --> 00:10:36.470
Soo Yung's here?

168
00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:38.222
I haven't seen her
since she was ten years old.

169
00:10:38.305 --> 00:10:40.349
She lives in Los Angeles now.

170
00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:42.601
Let's go to the gift shop
and get her a little teddy bear.

171
00:10:45.187 --> 00:10:46.313
And a bra.

172
00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:47.314
- Lee!
- Soo Yung.

173
00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:49.107
I'm so glad you're here.

174
00:10:50.776 --> 00:10:52.486
- Detective Carter.
- Soo Yung.

175
00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:55.280
- It's been so long.
- So long, Soo Yung.

176
00:10:55.364 --> 00:10:56.615
So--So young.

177
00:10:57.908 --> 00:11:00.202
- How is he?
- He's out of surgery.

178
00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:02.454
They said he'll be OK.

179
00:11:04.498 --> 00:11:06.792
(Sighs) Soo Yung, I'm sorry.

180
00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:09.211
(Speaking Mandarin)

181
00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:18.595
I want you both
to promise me something.

182
00:11:19.847 --> 00:11:22.724
I want you to find the man
who did this to him.

183
00:11:22.808 --> 00:11:24.852
I want you to find him because
I don't think he'll stop...

184
00:11:24.935 --> 00:11:26.311
until my father is dead.

185
00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:28.647
Soo Yung.

186
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.774
I need to hear you say it.

187
00:11:31.984 --> 00:11:33.735
OK, I promise.

188
00:11:33.819 --> 00:11:34.820
And so do I.

189
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:40.576
Thank you.

190
00:11:40.659 --> 00:11:45.080
Soo Yung, your father was
addressing the court before he was shot.

191
00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:48.625
Two weeks ago, my father
mailed me an envelope.

192
00:11:48.709 --> 00:11:50.627
He said if anything ever
happened to him...

193
00:11:50.711 --> 00:11:52.921
- I should give it to you.
- Where is it?

194
00:11:53.005 --> 00:11:56.717
I put it in my locker
at the kung-fu studio where I teach.

195
00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.346
It's at 8347 First Street...

196
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.348
Chinatown.

197
00:12:13.859 --> 00:12:16.445
Go home, Carter.
This has nothing to do with you.

198
00:12:16.528 --> 00:12:18.614
I made Soo Yung a promise,
the same as you.

199
00:12:18.697 --> 00:12:21.283
This is the business of China.

200
00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:23.869
Well, for your information,
I'm part Chinese now.

201
00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:25.871
That's right, Lee.
For the last three years I've studied...

202
00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:27.956
the ancient teachings of Buddha,
earning two black belts...

203
00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.833
in wushu martial arts,
spending every afternoon...

204
00:12:29.917 --> 00:12:32.210
at the Hong Kong Garden massage parlor
on Pico and Bundy.

205
00:12:32.294 --> 00:12:33.629
I am half-Chinese, baby.

206
00:12:33.712 --> 00:12:36.131
If you're half-Chinese,
I'm half-black.

207
00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:39.217
I'm your brother and I'm fly.
You down with that, Snoopy?

208
00:12:39.301 --> 00:12:40.802
That's dope, isn't it?

209
00:12:40.886 --> 00:12:43.847
Sorry, Lee, you can't be black.
There's a height requirement.

210
00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:45.098
Same as riding the Matterhorn.

211
00:12:45.182 --> 00:12:46.183
Go home, Carter.

212
00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:47.601
I can't leave you, Lee.

213
00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:49.728
(Speaks Mandarin)

214
00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:51.063
Can't leave my brother.

215
00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:53.774
(Sighs)

216
00:12:55.067 --> 00:12:56.485
(Rhythmic thudding and shouting)

217
00:12:56.568 --> 00:12:59.237
(Man shouting instructions)

218
00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:15.587
All right, listen up!
I need everyone's attention.

219
00:13:15.671 --> 00:13:19.007
I'm Detective Carter,
this is Inspector Lee.

220
00:13:19.091 --> 00:13:21.969
We need to see Soo Yung's
locker right now.

221
00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:24.763
No one's allowed in the back
without the master's permission.

222
00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:28.850
Maybe you didn't hear me.
We need to see that locker.

223
00:13:28.934 --> 00:13:31.019
- I'm sorry.
- Wait. Carter.

224
00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:32.813
Lee, I got this.

225
00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:36.149
Hey! Heh heh. Kids.

226
00:13:36.233 --> 00:13:39.111
Listen. Violence will solve nothin'.

227
00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:42.406
Now, as the Chinese say, all great battles
are won without fightin'.

228
00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:43.699
- Sorry.
- CARTER: OK?

229
00:13:43.782 --> 00:13:44.992
I don't know him.

230
00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:46.076
Now, let's just calm down
and put this--

231
00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:47.327
- Haa!
- Ow!

232
00:13:47.411 --> 00:13:48.870
God da--

233
00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:53.083
OK...

234
00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:55.252
(Panting) I tried talkin'.

235
00:13:56.628 --> 00:13:59.256
Hoo! Now I'm about to beat
the puberty out of y'all.

236
00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:02.134
You ain't gonna see it comin'.
You ain't gonna see it comin', come on!

237
00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:04.261
- CARTER: Waaa! Whoo!
- (Yells)

238
00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:06.263
Runnin' for your lives.

239
00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:09.016
About time y'all showed
some respect around here.

240
00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:13.145
- (Panting) Huh?
- Carter, wait for the master.

241
00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:18.984
Whoa!

242
00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:20.736
Damn!

243
00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:23.447
Heh, I'm sorry, man.
I thought this was the bathroom.

244
00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:24.740
Sorry.

245
00:14:24.823 --> 00:14:27.826
Lee, I got a big problem, man.

246
00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:30.245
This boy's on steroids.
He got a head like Barry Bonds.

247
00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:31.455
- Oh, no.
- Come on, man.

248
00:14:31.538 --> 00:14:33.540
- Aaaaah!
- Aaaah!

249
00:14:33.623 --> 00:14:34.624
Ah!

250
00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:36.585
Carter, are you OK?

251
00:14:36.668 --> 00:14:38.336
- Lee, Lee, get him, Lee!
- (Roars)

252
00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.379
- (Crunch)
- Ooh!

253
00:14:39.463 --> 00:14:41.048
Ahhh! Ah!

254
00:14:41.131 --> 00:14:42.424
- Ah!
- (Roars)

255
00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:44.009
Urgh!

256
00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:45.677
Lee, let's get the hell outta--

257
00:14:45.761 --> 00:14:47.304
Aah! My bunions!

258
00:14:48.305 --> 00:14:50.348
Yah! Hyah! Mm! Ungh!

259
00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:52.434
- Grr! Rargh!
- Ha ha ha.

260
00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:54.770
Urgh! Whoo!

261
00:14:54.853 --> 00:14:56.271
Oh! Aaaah!

262
00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:58.106
Come on, man, let me go.
I love Chinese people!

263
00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.067
- (Roars)
- Aaaah!

264
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.276
Wait. I don't--

265
00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:04.446
(Both grunting)

266
00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:09.951
(Roars)

267
00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:11.369
- Ah!
- (Roars)

268
00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:12.996
Urgh!

269
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.290
How do you say "surrender"
in Chinese?

270
00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:17.042
Aaaah!

271
00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:21.421
(Panting) OK. I'm about to slice you up
like a giant California roll!

272
00:15:21.505 --> 00:15:22.756
Raaah!

273
00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:24.382
(Whimpers)

274
00:15:26.218 --> 00:15:28.762
- (High-pitched) Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
- Ha ha ha. Funny black man.

275
00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:30.222
Ooh--oh! Shit!

276
00:15:30.305 --> 00:15:31.973
(Children laughing)

277
00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:33.350
I'm not playin' no more.

278
00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:35.143
Ahh!

279
00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:37.145
Aaah!

280
00:15:37.229 --> 00:15:39.898
(All grunting and yelling)

281
00:15:43.652 --> 00:15:45.862
- Lee, let go!
- Carter!

282
00:15:45.946 --> 00:15:49.032
- Grrrrr!
- (Both screaming)

283
00:15:49.116 --> 00:15:51.326
CARTER: Down! Put us down!

284
00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:52.536
(Children laughing)

285
00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:54.871
CARTER: Let me down! I'm sorry!

286
00:15:54.955 --> 00:15:57.165
- Aaaaah!
- I'm sorry, man!

287
00:15:57.249 --> 00:15:58.458
CARTER: How the hell did we
get in this mess?

288
00:15:58.542 --> 00:16:00.127
(Shouts out instruction)

289
00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.503
- Ugh!
- Agh!

290
00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:03.964
(Carter and Lee
coughing and groaning)

291
00:16:04.047 --> 00:16:05.465
(Shouts out instruction)

292
00:16:09.261 --> 00:16:10.971
(Shouts out instruction)

293
00:16:14.766 --> 00:16:16.101
May I help you?

294
00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:19.146
(Panting) We'll be asking
the questions, old man.

295
00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:20.272
- Who are you?
- Yu.

296
00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:22.065
- No, not me. You.
- Yes, I am Yu.

297
00:16:22.149 --> 00:16:23.567
Just answer the damn questions.

298
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.318
- Who are you?
- I have told you.

299
00:16:25.402 --> 00:16:27.404
- Are you deaf?
- No, Yu is blind.

300
00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:28.697
I'm not blind, you blind.

301
00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.116
- That is what I just said.
- You just said what?

302
00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:33.827
- I did not say what, I said Yu.
- That's what I'm asking you.

303
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.787
- And Yu is answering.
- Shut up!

304
00:16:35.871 --> 00:16:36.788
- You!
- Yes?

305
00:16:36.872 --> 00:16:37.873
Not you, him!

306
00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:39.082
- What's your name?
- Mi.

307
00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:40.625
- Yes, you!
- I am Mi.

308
00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:42.627
He is Mi, and I am Yu.

309
00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:45.672
And I'm about to whup your old ass, man,
'cause I'm sick of playin' games!

310
00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:48.925
You, me, everybody's ass
around here! Him!

311
00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:50.302
- Carter, Carter.
- I'm-a kick his ass.

312
00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:51.761
- I'm sick of this.
- Carter, let me handle this.

313
00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:52.971
- Lee. No, Lee. No!
- Carter!

314
00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:54.764
(Whispering) Go.

315
00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:57.142
(Speaking Mandarin)

316
00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:14.659
(Exhales) Let's go.

317
00:17:14.743 --> 00:17:15.911
(Speaks Mandarin)

318
00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:17.537
I don't know what the hell
you feedin' him...

319
00:17:17.621 --> 00:17:20.540
- but he is too damn big!
- LEE: Carter. Go.

320
00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:28.757
(Tires squeal)

321
00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:38.600
(Phone ringing)

322
00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:42.687
Where is everyone?

323
00:17:42.771 --> 00:17:44.356
Where's all the damn cops?

324
00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:51.821
- Lee.
- Where's security?

325
00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:53.156
They were called away.

326
00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.367
W--What's wrong?

327
00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.160
- Carter.
- (Men shouting, faint)

328
00:17:58.245 --> 00:18:00.121
Aw, this ain't good.

329
00:18:00.205 --> 00:18:02.374
They're coming for him.

330
00:18:02.457 --> 00:18:03.959
What do we do?

331
00:18:16.513 --> 00:18:17.847
No.

332
00:18:20.892 --> 00:18:22.269
No!

333
00:18:23.687 --> 00:18:27.107
CARTER: Don't move, or I'll
blow your ass cheeks off.

334
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:28.483
Get back.

335
00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:29.901
Ugh!

336
00:18:30.902 --> 00:18:32.779
- Who sent you?
- (Doors opening)

337
00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:35.198
Oh!

338
00:18:37.242 --> 00:18:38.660
Don't move!

339
00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:44.499
Lee, throw me a gun!

340
00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:45.875
- Huh?
- Throw me a gun!

341
00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:50.338
- Damn, Lee!
- Huh?

342
00:18:50.422 --> 00:18:51.798
(All grunting)

343
00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:53.300
(Bullet ricochets)

344
00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:55.593
(All grunting)

345
00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:02.350
(Gunshots)

346
00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:18.450
Lee! I thought you had my back!

347
00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:23.371
Aaaaaah!

348
00:19:24.414 --> 00:19:26.291
(Both grunting)

349
00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:30.128
Ugh! (Choking sounds)

350
00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:36.426
Soo Yung, one more!

351
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.180
Hyah!

352
00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:43.141
Aaaaah!

353
00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:46.728
Lee, I'm in trouble!
I need some assistance.

354
00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:49.814
Here.

355
00:19:49.898 --> 00:19:51.232
(Clicking)

356
00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:52.442
It's empty.

357
00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:53.777
What?

358
00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:57.655
Hah!

359
00:20:02.494 --> 00:20:04.412
You see? I always got your back.

360
00:20:04.496 --> 00:20:06.039
Why the hell you give me
an empty gun, then?

361
00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:08.041
I didn't know.

362
00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:10.335
You almost got me killed, Lee.

363
00:20:11.336 --> 00:20:12.629
(Sighs)

364
00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:14.672
- Ah! Ahh!
- Who are you? Who sent you?

365
00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:17.467
(Shouting in Mandarin)

366
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.302
(Shouting in French)

367
00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:20.387
What the hell is that?

368
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:21.471
I think he's speaking French.

369
00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:23.473
French? What kind of
Chinaman speak French?

370
00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:25.016
Tell him to stop playin' around
and talk right.

371
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.684
How can I tell him?
I don't speak French.

372
00:20:26.768 --> 00:20:28.770
- (Shouting in French)
- Ah!

373
00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:30.647
- Talk right, man.
- (Shouting in French)

374
00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.233
No! You're Asian.
Stop humiliatin' yourself.

375
00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:35.402
- (Shouting in French)
- Shut the hell up.

376
00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:36.820
Shut up. Come here.

377
00:20:36.903 --> 00:20:37.946
- (Speaking in French)
- We're gonna need...

378
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:39.906
a few minutes alone
with this guy.

379
00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:41.908
Find someone here
who speaks French, please.

380
00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:43.785
(Shouting in French, muffled)

381
00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:45.120
Speak English!

382
00:20:45.203 --> 00:20:46.413
(Shouting in French)

383
00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.958
Uh, this is Sister Agnes
from the chapel upstairs.

384
00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:52.794
She speaks fluent French and has
agreed to interpret for you.

385
00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:54.671
Sister, we appreciate you doin' this.

386
00:20:54.754 --> 00:20:55.672
My pleasure.

387
00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:58.216
Sister Agnes,
please ask who sent him.

388
00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:04.597
(Speaking French)

389
00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:07.016
He says you're both making
a big mistake.

390
00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.102
That one day soon
you'll beg for mercy.

391
00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:10.520
He also said--

392
00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:12.188
What?

393
00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:14.774
Please, Sister, we have to know.

394
00:21:14.858 --> 00:21:15.942
There's lives at stake.

395
00:21:16.943 --> 00:21:18.570
Well, he used the N-word.

396
00:21:18.653 --> 00:21:20.655
What? The N-word?

397
00:21:20.738 --> 00:21:22.866
- You tell this little motherf--
- Carter!

398
00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:25.910
She's a nun.

399
00:21:25.994 --> 00:21:30.915
Sister, you tell this piece of S-word
that I will personally F-word him up.

400
00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:35.295
(Speaking French)

401
00:21:35.378 --> 00:21:36.880
(Shouting in French)

402
00:21:40.884 --> 00:21:41.885
Did he say "Negro"?

403
00:21:41.968 --> 00:21:44.971
He used the N-word again, but this time
he mentioned your grandmother.

404
00:21:45.054 --> 00:21:47.765
You tell him
that his mama's a H!

405
00:21:47.849 --> 00:21:51.019
Carter, I believe "whore" is
spelled with a W.

406
00:21:51.102 --> 00:21:53.354
Right. W. And his sister's a W.

407
00:21:53.438 --> 00:21:55.315
And his grandmama's
a two-bit W...

408
00:21:55.398 --> 00:21:57.358
who makes double
'cause she got no teeth!

409
00:21:57.442 --> 00:21:59.194
You tell him I said that.

410
00:22:00.653 --> 00:22:02.655
(Speaking French)

411
00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:07.577
(Speaking French)

412
00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:12.457
Did he say it again?

413
00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.501
No. This time he called...

414
00:22:14.584 --> 00:22:17.212
this gentleman a word
that means "cat"...

415
00:22:17.295 --> 00:22:19.964
and another word that rhymes
with "maggot."

416
00:22:20.048 --> 00:22:21.132
What?!

417
00:22:22.008 --> 00:22:25.053
Well, you tell him he's an A.W.

418
00:22:25.136 --> 00:22:27.597
Uh, Lee, "hole" is spelled with a H.

419
00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.307
I have a dictionary upstairs.

420
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:30.850
Just call him an asshole.

421
00:22:30.934 --> 00:22:32.977
(Shouting in French)

422
00:22:35.688 --> 00:22:38.650
He says you've both been
marked for death like Han and the girl.

423
00:22:38.733 --> 00:22:41.486
Ooh. Sister, turn your back.
You don't want to see this.

424
00:22:41.569 --> 00:22:43.571
Who is Shy Shen
and how do we find him?

425
00:22:43.655 --> 00:22:46.074
Tell us right now or I'll cut your B's off
and shove 'em in your mouth.

426
00:22:46.157 --> 00:22:48.368
- His beads?
- His beads, sister.

427
00:22:48.451 --> 00:22:49.869
His hairy, stinkin' beads.

428
00:22:49.953 --> 00:22:51.412
Tell me somethin' now.

429
00:22:51.496 --> 00:22:53.957
Lee, give me the gun.
Give me the gun, Lee.

430
00:22:55.833 --> 00:22:58.753
(Whispering) It's over, brother.
It's over. OK.

431
00:22:58.836 --> 00:23:00.380
- Who is Shy Shen?!
- (Shouts French word)

432
00:23:00.463 --> 00:23:01.422
What did he say, sister?

433
00:23:01.506 --> 00:23:02.882
He said "shoot me."

434
00:23:02.966 --> 00:23:04.634
- (Gun clicks)
- (Shouts French word)

435
00:23:04.717 --> 00:23:06.469
Lee, there's no bullets in here.

436
00:23:06.553 --> 00:23:10.098
- I'm sorry.
- I am trying to kill somebody, man.

437
00:23:10.181 --> 00:23:12.850
Damn. OK.

438
00:23:12.934 --> 00:23:14.102
You better tell me
something right now.

439
00:23:14.185 --> 00:23:15.270
I'll send you right to heaven, man.

440
00:23:15.353 --> 00:23:16.729
- I don't even care no more.
- LEE: Carter.

441
00:23:16.813 --> 00:23:18.648
I'm marked for death.
I ain't got nothin' to lose.

442
00:23:18.731 --> 00:23:20.441
- (Praying in Latin)
- That's right, Sister.

443
00:23:20.525 --> 00:23:22.944
Call the Lord and tell him
he 'bout to have some company.

444
00:23:23.027 --> 00:23:24.904
- (Praying in Latin)
- LEE: Carter, stop.

445
00:23:24.988 --> 00:23:26.906
- Tell me something!
- (Praying in Latin)

446
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:28.950
- Carter, enough.
- Oh, she's almost done.

447
00:23:29.033 --> 00:23:30.868
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned!

448
00:23:30.952 --> 00:23:32.453
- (Shouts in French)
- He says wait!

449
00:23:32.537 --> 00:23:35.748
(Speaking French)

450
00:23:35.832 --> 00:23:38.710
- What did he say?
- 50 Franklin D. Roosevelt.

451
00:23:38.793 --> 00:23:39.919
Geneviève.

452
00:23:40.003 --> 00:23:41.796
Thank you.

453
00:23:44.173 --> 00:23:45.425
Nice workin' with ya, Sister.

454
00:23:45.508 --> 00:23:47.051
Anytime, brother.

455
00:23:49.345 --> 00:23:50.722
50 FDR.

456
00:23:50.805 --> 00:23:52.682
- It's an address.
- It's a wild goose chase.

457
00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:55.226
Every city in America has
a street named after Roosevelt.

458
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:57.437
- And who is Geneviève?
- I don't know.

459
00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.148
Soo Yung, we're getting you
out of here.

460
00:24:00.231 --> 00:24:01.816
- Why?
- It's not safe for you here.

461
00:24:01.899 --> 00:24:03.067
I won't leave him.

462
00:24:03.151 --> 00:24:04.819
We have no choice.

463
00:24:30.094 --> 00:24:32.013
- Soo Yung.
- Mr. Reynard.

464
00:24:33.264 --> 00:24:34.807
I'm glad your father is OK.

465
00:24:34.891 --> 00:24:36.559
My people won't leave his side.

466
00:24:36.643 --> 00:24:38.311
- You have my word.
- Thank you.

467
00:24:38.394 --> 00:24:39.646
So, let's go.

468
00:24:39.729 --> 00:24:41.939
- Ah.
- Wh--Where am I going?

469
00:24:42.023 --> 00:24:45.360
We're getting out of Los Angeles.
It's not safe for us.

470
00:24:45.443 --> 00:24:47.528
Just a few days, Soo Yung.
I promise.

471
00:24:47.612 --> 00:24:50.281
REYNARD: You'll come with me
and my family to Paris.

472
00:24:53.451 --> 00:24:55.495
OK.

473
00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.625
Wait.

474
00:25:02.752 --> 00:25:04.128
You made me a promise.

475
00:25:06.297 --> 00:25:07.715
Don't forget.

476
00:25:11.427 --> 00:25:12.929
(Soo Yung screams)

477
00:25:18.893 --> 00:25:20.144
My God.

478
00:25:21.646 --> 00:25:24.357
CARTER: We got a assassin in
custody who only speaks French...

479
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.984
a limo blows up
at the French Consulate...

480
00:25:27.068 --> 00:25:30.947
and the next meeting of the World Court
is in Paris, two days from now.

481
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.240
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

482
00:25:32.323 --> 00:25:33.282
Yeah.

483
00:25:33.366 --> 00:25:35.076
That we go to Fiji,
we hide out for a year...

484
00:25:35.159 --> 00:25:36.953
maybe change our names,
get jobs as bartenders...

485
00:25:37.036 --> 00:25:38.329
and I'm-a call you Kiko.

486
00:25:38.413 --> 00:25:41.207
We have to find Shy Shen
before he finds us.

487
00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:42.667
We're going to Paris, aren't we?

488
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.502
Yes. Tonight.

489
00:25:48.756 --> 00:25:51.551
(Indistinct announcement in French)

490
00:25:54.303 --> 00:25:58.141
Did you know the average French woman
is naked 34 percent of the time?

491
00:25:58.224 --> 00:26:00.017
We are not going there
to meet women.

492
00:26:02.353 --> 00:26:05.106
You have to forget about her,
and let me hook you up.

493
00:26:05.189 --> 00:26:08.025
Hook me up?
After what you did to Isabella?

494
00:26:08.109 --> 00:26:09.736
It was an accident.

495
00:26:09.819 --> 00:26:11.154
Besides, you never even
slept with her.

496
00:26:11.237 --> 00:26:13.740
Thanks to you.
It was going to happen.

497
00:26:13.823 --> 00:26:15.158
But you just had to ruin it.

498
00:26:15.241 --> 00:26:16.451
What did I do that was so terrible?

499
00:26:16.534 --> 00:26:19.036
You shot my girlfriend.
In the neck!

500
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.413
There's nothing else to say.

501
00:26:20.496 --> 00:26:21.622
It's not like she died.

502
00:26:21.706 --> 00:26:24.667
So she has droopy eyes.
So she works at El Poco Loco.

503
00:26:24.751 --> 00:26:26.169
That was temporary.

504
00:26:26.252 --> 00:26:28.755
As soon as she could blink,
the Secret Service took her back.

505
00:26:28.838 --> 00:26:31.799
You know what your problem is?
You need to relax, have some fun.

506
00:26:31.883 --> 00:26:34.510
You have too much rice in your diet.
You're constipated.

507
00:26:34.594 --> 00:26:36.095
I never should have brought you.

508
00:26:36.179 --> 00:26:37.513
Face it, you need me, brother.

509
00:26:37.597 --> 00:26:40.975
I don't need anyone.
And please don't call me brother.

510
00:26:41.058 --> 00:26:42.018
What is this?

511
00:26:42.101 --> 00:26:44.270
Underground gentleman's club
in Paris.

512
00:26:44.353 --> 00:26:46.105
"Club La Passe"? Forget it.

513
00:26:46.189 --> 00:26:48.316
Check out the address.

514
00:26:48.399 --> 00:26:50.735
"50 Franklin D...Roosevelt."

515
00:26:50.818 --> 00:26:53.070
Like I said, you need me.

516
00:26:53.154 --> 00:26:57.825
'Scuse me. Can we have one
gefilte fish and some Ex-Lax?

517
00:26:57.909 --> 00:27:00.912
(P.A. announcement in French)

518
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.001
Where the bags at, man?

519
00:27:08.294 --> 00:27:10.838
Excuse me, gentlemen.

520
00:27:10.922 --> 00:27:13.883
Commissaire Revi of the DST.
Would you please come with me?

521
00:27:13.966 --> 00:27:15.218
Why?

522
00:27:15.301 --> 00:27:18.012
Just need to ask you
a few questions.

523
00:27:18.095 --> 00:27:21.557
- (Whipping and thudding sounds)
- Oh! Oh! Man! Goddamn, man!

524
00:27:21.641 --> 00:27:25.478
Oh! Man, this is by far
the worst airport I ever been to.

525
00:27:25.561 --> 00:27:27.146
Oh!

526
00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:28.731
- Ooph!
- Ah, man!

527
00:27:28.815 --> 00:27:31.150
Now that I have your attention,
why don't you tell me...

528
00:27:31.234 --> 00:27:33.319
what you cops are looking for
here in Paris.

529
00:27:33.402 --> 00:27:35.696
(Panting) I told you, man.
We on vacation.

530
00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.198
(Panting) Just taking in the sights.

531
00:27:37.281 --> 00:27:39.659
Gentlemen, this is my city...

532
00:27:39.742 --> 00:27:42.453
and I'm responsible if
two stupid cops come here...

533
00:27:42.537 --> 00:27:45.164
and get their heads
blown off by the triads.

534
00:27:45.248 --> 00:27:49.335
Now, I can't force you to leave,
but I can make the suggestion.

535
00:27:49.418 --> 00:27:54.090
After all, I found this dirty little gun
inside your jacket.

536
00:27:54.173 --> 00:27:58.094
Which means you could both
do 20 years in my jail.

537
00:27:58.177 --> 00:27:59.762
Do we understand each other?

538
00:28:00.972 --> 00:28:02.890
Do we understand each other?

539
00:28:02.974 --> 00:28:07.144
Excellent. It was wonderful
meeting you both.

540
00:28:07.979 --> 00:28:10.773
(Panting) So we can go now?

541
00:28:10.857 --> 00:28:12.692
This will just take a moment.

542
00:28:12.775 --> 00:28:14.485
Welcome to Paris.

543
00:28:14.569 --> 00:28:15.987
Oh, shit.

544
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:20.199
- (P.A. announcement in French)
- (Car horns honking)

545
00:28:26.706 --> 00:28:28.583
Ohh. Ohhh.

546
00:28:28.666 --> 00:28:30.918
- Ahh.
- Where you go?

547
00:28:31.002 --> 00:28:32.920
- Ugh.
- 50 Franklin, uh...

548
00:28:33.004 --> 00:28:34.005
D. Roosevelt.

549
00:28:34.088 --> 00:28:35.923
No. Get out.

550
00:28:36.007 --> 00:28:37.592
- BOTH: What?
- I don't drive his kind.

551
00:28:37.675 --> 00:28:39.135
- My kind?
- Americans.

552
00:28:39.218 --> 00:28:40.553
I don't drive Americans.

553
00:28:40.636 --> 00:28:42.597
- But I'm Chinese.
- Yeah, but you're with him...

554
00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.599
and they're the most
violent people on earth.

555
00:28:44.682 --> 00:28:46.767
Always starting wars,
always killing people.

556
00:28:46.851 --> 00:28:48.477
Americans make me sick.

557
00:28:48.561 --> 00:28:50.563
Look, man, we are not
in the mood for this.

558
00:28:50.646 --> 00:28:53.316
Me and my partner just got
violated by a small Frenchman.

559
00:28:53.399 --> 00:28:54.942
Wearing a very large ring.

560
00:28:55.026 --> 00:28:58.571
You're a pathetic bunch of criminals
who always resort to violence.

561
00:28:58.654 --> 00:29:00.072
Always push around the little guy.

562
00:29:00.156 --> 00:29:01.908
Hey, that stuff ain't true.
America's not violent!

563
00:29:01.991 --> 00:29:03.868
Come on, America is a joke.

564
00:29:03.951 --> 00:29:05.870
You lost in Vietnam,
you lost in Iraq.

565
00:29:05.953 --> 00:29:08.456
You can't even beat the Europeans
in basketball anymore.

566
00:29:08.539 --> 00:29:09.957
The Dream Team is dead.

567
00:29:10.041 --> 00:29:12.335
Ha ha. I didn't hear you, man.

568
00:29:12.418 --> 00:29:14.795
Talk about the NBA again,
I dare ya. I double-dare ya.

569
00:29:14.879 --> 00:29:17.089
Even your skinny women disgust me.

570
00:29:17.173 --> 00:29:18.966
- Halle Berry.
- Wh--? Aw, hell no.

571
00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:20.217
Now you done gone too far.

572
00:29:20.301 --> 00:29:21.802
You want violence,
smelly Frenchman? Huh?

573
00:29:21.886 --> 00:29:23.596
Do you want violence?
Well, you got it!

574
00:29:23.679 --> 00:29:25.598
- Carter, put the gun down.
- Say you love America.

575
00:29:25.681 --> 00:29:28.017
I love America.
Please, don't kill me.

576
00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.393
Sing the national anthem!

577
00:29:29.477 --> 00:29:31.145
(Singing La Marseillaise)

578
00:29:31.228 --> 00:29:33.314
Not that one, man!
Sing the American one.

579
00:29:33.397 --> 00:29:34.690
Don't know it.

580
00:29:34.774 --> 00:29:39.528
♪ Oh, say can you see ♪

581
00:29:39.612 --> 00:29:43.157
♪ Oh, say can you see ♪

582
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.869
♪ By the dawn's early light ♪

583
00:29:46.953 --> 00:29:49.956

584
00:30:03.052 --> 00:30:05.554
(Car horn blaring)

585
00:30:20.111 --> 00:30:22.029
CARTER: Wait for us here, George.

586
00:30:22.113 --> 00:30:24.365
(Gentle music playing, quiet chatter)

587
00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:38.212
Ooh la la. Lee.

588
00:30:38.295 --> 00:30:39.839
Carter, stay focused.

589
00:30:39.922 --> 00:30:41.549
We're looking for Geneviève.

590
00:30:41.632 --> 00:30:44.969
Let's split up.
I'll take the women.

591
00:30:49.724 --> 00:30:51.600
(Dealer speaking French)

592
00:30:52.685 --> 00:30:53.728
(Speaking French)

593
00:30:53.811 --> 00:30:57.815
(Dealer speaking French)

594
00:31:00.985 --> 00:31:02.820
(Dealer speaking French)

595
00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.038
Carter. James Carter.

596
00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:15.249
(Speaking French)

597
00:31:15.332 --> 00:31:16.959
(Dealer speaking French)

598
00:31:17.043 --> 00:31:19.587
I know you probably don't understand
a word I'm saying...

599
00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:20.921
but I gotta tell you...

600
00:31:21.005 --> 00:31:23.382
you're the most beautiful woman
I ever seen in my life.

601
00:31:23.466 --> 00:31:25.634
And I'd like to strip you down
and butter you...

602
00:31:25.718 --> 00:31:27.595
like a slice of Wonder Bread.

603
00:31:27.678 --> 00:31:31.432
And shave your armpits
and pour honey all over your naked body.

604
00:31:31.515 --> 00:31:34.602
And for the next two weeks
pretend I was a hungry bear.

605
00:31:34.685 --> 00:31:39.065
Well, James Carter,
I happen to speak six languages.

606
00:31:39.148 --> 00:31:40.775
One of 'em English?

607
00:31:40.858 --> 00:31:42.276
(Speaking French)

608
00:31:42.359 --> 00:31:44.528
Are you in or out?

609
00:31:48.324 --> 00:31:49.784
Money plays.

610
00:31:49.867 --> 00:31:51.786
Sir, it's a thousand-euro minimum.

611
00:31:51.869 --> 00:31:53.287
How much I'm short?

612
00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:55.289
930 euros.

613
00:31:55.372 --> 00:31:57.458
- Heh.
- It's OK.

614
00:31:57.541 --> 00:31:59.293
Let him play.

615
00:31:59.376 --> 00:32:00.377
Thank you.

616
00:32:00.461 --> 00:32:01.712
<i>Changez.</i>

617
00:32:01.796 --> 00:32:02.713
- MAN: <i>Changez.
- 2ND MAN: Changez.</i>

618
00:32:02.797 --> 00:32:03.798
<i>Changez?</i>

619
00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.771
(Speaking French)

620
00:32:18.854 --> 00:32:20.689
I'm looking for Geneviève.

621
00:32:23.359 --> 00:32:25.361
(Speaking French)

622
00:32:28.489 --> 00:32:30.157
WOMAN: Maybe I can help you.

623
00:32:34.578 --> 00:32:36.080
Do you know what
I hate about cops?

624
00:32:38.249 --> 00:32:39.875
Even when they're with a woman...

625
00:32:39.959 --> 00:32:43.337
they can't stop thinking
about getting their man.

626
00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.132
Who is Shy Shen?

627
00:32:46.215 --> 00:32:47.550
See what I mean?

628
00:32:49.593 --> 00:32:53.305
Come upstairs, cop.
I'll give you what you want.

629
00:32:58.269 --> 00:33:01.063
- Hit me.
- <i>Monsieur,</i> this is baccarat.

630
00:33:01.147 --> 00:33:02.356
I know that!

631
00:33:02.439 --> 00:33:04.692
You think I don't know
baccarack when I play it?

632
00:33:04.775 --> 00:33:06.527
When I was a kid,
me and my friends and I...

633
00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:08.237
used to hang out in front of
the Magic Johnson Theater...

634
00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.489
and play baccarack all night long.

635
00:33:10.573 --> 00:33:12.533
Now hit me.

636
00:33:18.581 --> 00:33:20.749
Three kings.
Read 'em and weep.

637
00:33:24.795 --> 00:33:26.130
Three kings is a zero.

638
00:33:26.213 --> 00:33:28.674
You have the worst possible hand.
You lose.

639
00:33:28.757 --> 00:33:30.301
What?

640
00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:34.555
DEALER:
Ah, <i>madame</i> has a 7.

641
00:33:34.638 --> 00:33:37.016
She wins 100,000 euros. Bravo.

642
00:33:37.099 --> 00:33:39.727
Mr. Carter, it appears
you have brought me luck.

643
00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:42.146
I'd like to bring you
breakfast in bed.

644
00:33:42.229 --> 00:33:45.608
(Dealer speaking French)

645
00:33:46.233 --> 00:33:47.693
Excuse me.

646
00:33:47.776 --> 00:33:49.445
(Dealer speaking French)

647
00:33:56.493 --> 00:33:57.912
(Whispering) Way to go, Lee.

648
00:33:57.995 --> 00:34:00.164
Today, my boy becomes a man.

649
00:34:01.999 --> 00:34:03.751
Why are you helping me?

650
00:34:03.834 --> 00:34:06.170
Maybe I'm helping myself.

651
00:34:06.253 --> 00:34:08.088
How do I find Geneviève?

652
00:34:08.172 --> 00:34:10.507
I see you like to get right to it.

653
00:34:10.591 --> 00:34:12.259
Do you know Shy Shen?

654
00:34:14.136 --> 00:34:16.013
Would you like to know
a secret, cop?

655
00:34:16.096 --> 00:34:17.431
Yes, please.

656
00:34:18.682 --> 00:34:21.518
Someone's gonna die here tonight.

657
00:34:27.024 --> 00:34:28.359
And it's you.

658
00:34:28.442 --> 00:34:29.693
- Huh! Huh!
- Ugh!

659
00:34:29.777 --> 00:34:31.862
- Huh!
- Ahh!

660
00:34:34.531 --> 00:34:36.200
Unh!

661
00:34:36.283 --> 00:34:37.701
- Unh!
-Ah!

662
00:34:38.911 --> 00:34:40.996
- Uh!
- Urgh! Ah!

663
00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.375
Ohh! Ah! Oh!

664
00:34:44.458 --> 00:34:46.877
Ugh! Grrrrr!

665
00:34:48.045 --> 00:34:50.130
WOMAN: Ohhh!

666
00:34:50.214 --> 00:34:54.009
- Ohhh!
- Ah! Ahhh!

667
00:34:54.093 --> 00:34:56.303
- LEE: Nngh! Guh!
- Oh! Ah!

668
00:34:56.387 --> 00:34:57.471
- LEE: Gnnh!
- Ahhh!

669
00:34:57.554 --> 00:35:00.307
(Grunting continues)

670
00:35:09.066 --> 00:35:11.318
Come on, crouching tiger,
don't hide that dragon.

671
00:35:11.402 --> 00:35:12.903
- Uh!
- Aaah!

672
00:35:12.987 --> 00:35:15.197
(Grunting continues)

673
00:35:25.541 --> 00:35:28.127
Do it, Lee.
You tear that ass up.

674
00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:30.129
- Ahh!
- Oh, oh!

675
00:35:41.015 --> 00:35:42.558
You are a super freak!

676
00:35:42.641 --> 00:35:43.976
LEE: Carter!

677
00:35:44.059 --> 00:35:45.227
Oh!

678
00:35:45.311 --> 00:35:46.645
- Run!
- Oh!

679
00:35:47.771 --> 00:35:50.899
(Women screaming, men shouting)

680
00:35:53.277 --> 00:35:54.528
- Ahh!
- Sorry.

681
00:35:54.611 --> 00:35:56.447
- You got a boyfriend?
- Carter!

682
00:35:58.741 --> 00:36:00.159
Start the car.

683
00:36:00.242 --> 00:36:02.661
- Start the car!
- Drive fast!

684
00:36:02.745 --> 00:36:04.830
(Tires squeal)

685
00:36:11.128 --> 00:36:13.213
(Horns blaring)

686
00:36:17.843 --> 00:36:18.969
(Tires squeal)

687
00:36:20.304 --> 00:36:21.847
(Tires squeal)

688
00:36:23.974 --> 00:36:26.477
Carter. Look!

689
00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.271
Uh, George?
We need you to go faster, man.

690
00:36:29.355 --> 00:36:30.481
No. Forget it.

691
00:36:30.564 --> 00:36:33.776
You wanna kill me,
then go ahead, kill me.

692
00:36:33.859 --> 00:36:35.944
- Ahh!
- Drive faster!

693
00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:40.282
Please! I'm scared!

694
00:36:40.366 --> 00:36:41.909
George, you watch
American movies?

695
00:36:41.992 --> 00:36:43.035
- Yeah.
- OK, man. All right.

696
00:36:43.118 --> 00:36:45.162
Listen, you're a super-spy.

697
00:36:45.245 --> 00:36:47.790
A super-spy.

698
00:36:47.873 --> 00:36:50.584
Now drive this cab.

699
00:36:50.667 --> 00:36:52.336
- Come on.
- OK.

700
00:36:53.587 --> 00:36:55.047
I'm a super-spy.

701
00:36:56.173 --> 00:36:57.841
(Tires squeal)

702
00:37:01.345 --> 00:37:02.596
(Horns blaring)

703
00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:08.685
CARTER: Oh, shit, George. Go!

704
00:37:08.769 --> 00:37:11.522
(Horn blaring)

705
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:14.149
- WOMAN: Aah!
- LEE: George...

706
00:37:14.233 --> 00:37:15.984
When I tell you to, hit the brakes.

707
00:37:20.155 --> 00:37:21.073
Now!

708
00:37:21.156 --> 00:37:22.491
(Tires squeal)

709
00:37:26.703 --> 00:37:27.871
Oh, they got guns, Lee!

710
00:37:27.955 --> 00:37:29.706
- Ungh!
- Ah!

711
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:32.042
(George shouting in French)

712
00:37:32.126 --> 00:37:33.961
- Ungh!
- Back up!

713
00:37:44.471 --> 00:37:45.722
Argh!

714
00:37:46.849 --> 00:37:48.976
Way to go, George.

715
00:37:51.562 --> 00:37:53.063
It's OK.

716
00:37:56.316 --> 00:37:57.568
Uh!

717
00:37:57.651 --> 00:37:58.652
Aah!

718
00:37:59.611 --> 00:38:00.612
MAN: Hey!

719
00:38:02.406 --> 00:38:04.241
(Tires squeal)

720
00:38:09.371 --> 00:38:10.956
I got this one.

721
00:38:12.291 --> 00:38:13.584
Aah!

722
00:38:13.667 --> 00:38:15.878
Oh! Whoa! He's got my leg!

723
00:38:16.587 --> 00:38:18.505
Aaaah!

724
00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:20.132
Lee! God!

725
00:38:20.215 --> 00:38:24.845
- Aaaaah!
- Hold m--

726
00:38:24.928 --> 00:38:26.054
LEE: Ah!

727
00:38:28.056 --> 00:38:30.684
(All grunting)

728
00:38:30.767 --> 00:38:31.852
(Horn blaring)

729
00:38:31.935 --> 00:38:33.061
Get your own damn cab.

730
00:38:33.145 --> 00:38:35.272
(Horn blaring)

731
00:38:35.355 --> 00:38:38.734
(All grunting and yelling)

732
00:38:40.944 --> 00:38:42.279
Ow!

733
00:38:42.362 --> 00:38:43.739
Lee!

734
00:38:43.822 --> 00:38:45.532
- Urgh!
- Yah!

735
00:38:46.909 --> 00:38:48.202
CARTER: Yeah! Whoa!

736
00:38:48.285 --> 00:38:49.578
- Ungh!
- Oh!

737
00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:52.498
The French are neutral!
This is not my fight!

738
00:38:52.581 --> 00:38:53.540
This is not--!

739
00:38:53.624 --> 00:38:56.210
(Panting)

740
00:38:56.293 --> 00:39:00.422
Ah! (Panting)
Lee, I'm alive.

741
00:39:00.506 --> 00:39:02.382
My whole life flashed in front of me.

742
00:39:02.466 --> 00:39:04.176
In three years I'll be married
to a Chinese woman.

743
00:39:04.259 --> 00:39:07.012
We had three kids looked just like you,
only a little darker.

744
00:39:07.095 --> 00:39:08.013
- Carter.
- What?

745
00:39:08.096 --> 00:39:09.890
Put your hands up.

746
00:39:09.973 --> 00:39:11.808
What you talkin' 'bout?

747
00:39:11.892 --> 00:39:13.727
Whoa!

748
00:39:30.702 --> 00:39:33.622
Some people say the modern world
was invented...

749
00:39:33.705 --> 00:39:36.458
when the French built
these sewers.

750
00:39:36.542 --> 00:39:39.753
10 million gallons pumped
through every hour.

751
00:39:39.836 --> 00:39:43.090
A marvel that no one ever sees.

752
00:39:43.173 --> 00:39:45.259
Welcome to Paris, Lee.

753
00:39:45.342 --> 00:39:46.718
Lee, you know this clown?

754
00:39:46.802 --> 00:39:49.179
Go on, Lee. Tell him who I am.

755
00:39:49.263 --> 00:39:50.597
Don't be shy.

756
00:39:50.681 --> 00:39:52.683
Introduce him
to your <i>shyong dih.</i>

757
00:39:52.766 --> 00:39:55.477
<i>Shyong dih?</i> Your brother?

758
00:39:55.561 --> 00:39:57.104
KENJI: He doesn't
talk about me much.

759
00:39:57.187 --> 00:40:00.232
In fact, he's spent his
whole life trying to forget me.

760
00:40:00.315 --> 00:40:02.901
How would it look if Hong Kong's
great Inspector Lee...

761
00:40:02.985 --> 00:40:05.571
had a brother on the wrong side
of the law?

762
00:40:05.654 --> 00:40:08.115
You're not my brother anymore.

763
00:40:08.198 --> 00:40:09.533
(Speaking Japanese)

764
00:40:24.548 --> 00:40:27.593
Let me repay the favor, Lee.

765
00:40:27.676 --> 00:40:31.388
I'II allow you to live
if you promise to leave Paris tonight.

766
00:40:31.471 --> 00:40:34.182
You got a deal. Thank you
for showin' us the sewer.

767
00:40:34.266 --> 00:40:36.893
Listen, that's a badass suit.
Let's get the hell outta here.

768
00:40:36.977 --> 00:40:39.521
What about Han and his daughter?

769
00:40:39.605 --> 00:40:41.356
There is nothing I can do for them.

770
00:40:42.482 --> 00:40:45.193
- I have no choice.
- Then I have no choice.

771
00:40:45.277 --> 00:40:48.405
Well, I guess he's stayin'.
Who wanna take me to the airport?

772
00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:52.618
We'll always be brothers, Lee.

773
00:40:52.701 --> 00:40:55.203
In this life and the next.

774
00:40:59.333 --> 00:41:01.251
Tell me, Kenji, who's Shy Shen?

775
00:41:02.586 --> 00:41:05.797
Some secrets are worth dying for.

776
00:41:05.881 --> 00:41:09.092
- (Man speaking French)
- Oh. OK. A--AII right. OK.

777
00:41:10.344 --> 00:41:12.679
Lee, what the hell is goin' on?

778
00:41:18.518 --> 00:41:19.895
Go!

779
00:41:19.978 --> 00:41:21.855
Hey, which way, man?

780
00:41:24.191 --> 00:41:25.484
(Shouting in French)

781
00:41:32.199 --> 00:41:34.117
- Shit, Lee, it's locked!
- Over here!

782
00:41:34.201 --> 00:41:35.911
- Lee!
- We have to jump!

783
00:41:36.953 --> 00:41:39.414
- Ooph.
- Oh, that's the sewer!

784
00:41:39.498 --> 00:41:41.500
- Hell no, Lee!
- No choice!

785
00:41:41.583 --> 00:41:42.751
- I'd rather die.
- Come on!

786
00:41:42.834 --> 00:41:43.960
(Shouting in French)

787
00:41:44.044 --> 00:41:45.712
Oh!

788
00:41:45.796 --> 00:41:50.425
BOTH: Shi-i-i-i-i-it!

789
00:41:53.553 --> 00:41:56.181
(Gags) I'm gonna kill you, Lee!

790
00:41:56.264 --> 00:41:58.767
(Man speaking quietly in French)

791
00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:02.187
(Squelching)

792
00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:07.192
<i>Bonjour</i>. Welcome to
the Plaza Athénée.

793
00:42:07.275 --> 00:42:08.318
How may I help you?

794
00:42:08.402 --> 00:42:11.488
It's great to see you again.
It's been too long.

795
00:42:11.571 --> 00:42:12.989
Yes, far too long, sir.

796
00:42:13.073 --> 00:42:15.992
Listen, I need a big suite,
two beds, two showers...

797
00:42:16.076 --> 00:42:19.579
a massage therapist, some new clothes
and a case of Old Spice.

798
00:42:19.663 --> 00:42:21.039
(Bell dings)

799
00:42:22.833 --> 00:42:26.044
It's all your fault.
How come you didn't tell me about Kenji?

800
00:42:26.128 --> 00:42:28.338
It was none of your business.

801
00:42:28.422 --> 00:42:32.259
In case you missed it, man,
people are tryin' to kill me.

802
00:42:32.342 --> 00:42:35.137
I'm covered in shit and some French cops
whupped my ass...

803
00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:36.513
with some Yellow Pages, man.

804
00:42:36.596 --> 00:42:38.140
So don't tell me it ain't
none of my business.

805
00:42:38.223 --> 00:42:39.683
You're lucky we're not
in Hong Kong.

806
00:42:39.766 --> 00:42:41.226
Phone book is twice as big.

807
00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:43.437
Why you didn't tell me
you had a brother, man?

808
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.689
(Trickling)

809
00:42:46.773 --> 00:42:48.567
Oh, hell, no--

810
00:42:49.443 --> 00:42:50.402
- Lady.
<i>- Oui?</i>

811
00:42:50.485 --> 00:42:53.071
This damn dog just pissed on me.

812
00:42:53.155 --> 00:42:54.823
Good girl.

813
00:42:57.534 --> 00:43:00.162
CARTER: You know what I think?

814
00:43:00.245 --> 00:43:03.290
I think you feel sorry for this guy.

815
00:43:03.373 --> 00:43:05.375
Maybe Kenji didn't get away in LA.

816
00:43:07.252 --> 00:43:09.379
Maybe you let him go.

817
00:43:09.463 --> 00:43:13.925
The yakuza killed his family in Tokyo.
He was sent to China when he was 7.

818
00:43:14.009 --> 00:43:18.430
He was put in Chenzhou,
the orphanage where I grew up.

819
00:43:18.513 --> 00:43:20.640
We kept each other alive.

820
00:43:20.724 --> 00:43:24.060
You protected each other.
And you're still protectin' him.

821
00:43:25.604 --> 00:43:27.439
I call him <i>shyong dih.</i>

822
00:43:27.522 --> 00:43:29.983
He was like my brother.

823
00:43:30.066 --> 00:43:32.068
And then I left him.

824
00:43:32.152 --> 00:43:34.112
You was adopted.
What choice did you have?

825
00:43:34.196 --> 00:43:36.281
He ended up on the streets.

826
00:43:37.866 --> 00:43:39.367
You could never understand.

827
00:43:39.451 --> 00:43:40.994
I understand, man.
I got a brother.

828
00:43:41.077 --> 00:43:42.037
My little brother Perry.

829
00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.331
We used to be best friends.
Now we don't even speak.

830
00:43:44.414 --> 00:43:47.083
He think I tipped off the cops
about his chicken fights in his garage.

831
00:43:47.167 --> 00:43:49.628
Can you believe that?
My own brother think I'm a snitch.

832
00:43:49.711 --> 00:43:51.463
Just 'cause my chicken lost
in the semifinals.

833
00:43:51.546 --> 00:43:52.464
I didn't even really care.

834
00:43:52.547 --> 00:43:53.757
- Carter.
- Fight was fixed, man.

835
00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:55.759
My bird was fightin' a chicken
that didn't make his weight.

836
00:43:55.842 --> 00:43:56.843
And he still went the distance.

837
00:43:56.927 --> 00:43:59.304
He had a lotta heart.
And he was delicious.

838
00:43:59.387 --> 00:44:02.808
It's best if I do this on my own.
This fight is personal.

839
00:44:02.891 --> 00:44:04.392
Lemme help you, man.
I'm-a tell you right now...

840
00:44:04.476 --> 00:44:05.936
whatever Kenji's
tellin' you, it ain't true.

841
00:44:06.019 --> 00:44:08.772
- He ain't your brother.
- And you are not my brother.

842
00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:11.399
(scoffs)

843
00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:15.654
Fine.

844
00:44:15.737 --> 00:44:17.989
I'm not your brother.

Minister Reynard.

878
00:46:23.615 --> 00:46:26.451
They want to kill me.
Me and my family.

879
00:46:26.534 --> 00:46:28.536
A dozen agents
from the French secret police...

880
00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:31.623
have already been murdered...
only this last month.

881
00:46:31.706 --> 00:46:34.250
We are at war with the triads,
right here in my own city.

Who is Shy Shen?

Ah, Shy Shen--uh--
Shy Shen is not a person.

884
00:46:39.422 --> 00:46:40.840
It's a list.

885
00:46:40.924 --> 00:46:43.134
- A list?
- Yes.

886
00:46:43.218 --> 00:46:46.137
Every 5 years, the triad bosses
come together...

887
00:46:46.221 --> 00:46:49.599
for an election, and during that ceremony
they choose the men...

888
00:46:49.683 --> 00:46:52.018
who will lead the triads.

889
00:46:52.102 --> 00:46:54.270
- Dragon heads.
- Yes.

890
00:46:54.354 --> 00:46:56.564
13 dragon heads who will control...

891
00:46:56.648 --> 00:46:59.359
the largest criminal organization
in the world.

892
00:46:59.442 --> 00:47:04.114
And their 13 names are inscribed
on the list known as Shy Shen.

893
00:47:04.197 --> 00:47:07.033
A list which has been handed down
and kept secret...

894
00:47:07.117 --> 00:47:09.911
from generation to generation.

895
00:47:09.995 --> 00:47:12.622
If the names on that list
were ever to get out...

896
00:47:12.706 --> 00:47:15.875
well, the secret society
wouldn't be so secret anymore...

897
00:47:15.959 --> 00:47:18.920
and they would all end up in jail,
or dead.

898
00:47:19.004 --> 00:47:20.714
And the list is somewhere in Paris?

899
00:47:20.797 --> 00:47:25.260
A young lady named Geneviève
made contact with Ambassador Han...

900
00:47:25.343 --> 00:47:27.345
and we believe she knows where it is.

901
00:47:30.223 --> 00:47:32.892

00:47:32.976 --> 00:47:36.062

00:56:31.013 --> 00:56:32.139
Trust me.

1048
00:56:32.223 --> 00:56:33.724
Now why should I trust you?

1049
00:56:33.808 --> 00:56:35.601
As the Chinese say...

1050
00:56:35.685 --> 00:56:37.603
(Speaking Mandarin)

1051
00:56:38.521 --> 00:56:39.772
What does that mean?

1052
00:56:39.855 --> 00:56:42.650
"A donkey's lips will not fit
on a horse's mouth."

1053
00:56:44.694 --> 00:56:46.320
I'm not sure how that applies.

1054
00:56:47.738 --> 00:56:51.993
Well, I was just thinking
you had nice lips.

1055
00:56:53.119 --> 00:56:55.580
(Whispering) That's all.

1056
00:56:55.663 --> 00:56:59.458
(Exhales) You saved my life today.
Thank you, Carter.

1057
00:56:59.542 --> 00:57:02.211
Oh, please. Call me James.

1058
00:57:02.295 --> 00:57:03.629
Or Stallion.

1059
00:57:03.713 --> 00:57:07.008
No one's saved me
in a long time.

1060
00:57:07.091 --> 00:57:08.467
How can I repay you?

1061
00:57:08.551 --> 00:57:10.136
You got 20 bucks?

1062
00:57:12.847 --> 00:57:14.348
How 'bout ten?

1063
00:57:15.558 --> 00:57:17.476
Oh, man. Mmm.

1064
00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:18.644
- James.
- What?

1065
00:57:18.728 --> 00:57:20.062
- I'm bad.
- I'm bad too.

1066
00:57:20.146 --> 00:57:21.230
I'm a bad girl.

1067
00:57:21.314 --> 00:57:23.232
Hallelujah!

1068
00:57:28.946 --> 00:57:30.072
(<i>La Vie En Rose</i> playing on radio)

1069
00:57:30.156 --> 00:57:31.324
(Kissing sounds, moaning)

1070
00:57:31.407 --> 00:57:32.908
CARTER: Oh, yeah.
That's it, baby. Yeah. Uh-oh.

1071
00:57:32.992 --> 00:57:35.036
(Inhales sharply) Ha ha.
Oh, yeah. That's it, baby.

1072
00:57:35.119 --> 00:57:37.496
(Inhales sharply) Oh, yeah.
Bite that ear. Punish that ear.

1073
00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:38.914
(Inhales sharply) Do what you wanna do.

1074
00:57:38.998 --> 00:57:40.875
Oh, baby--Whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait a minute.

1075
00:57:40.958 --> 00:57:42.376
My nipples are sensitive.
Be careful down there.

1076
00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:44.629
I've never been with
an American man before.

1077
00:57:44.712 --> 00:57:45.796
Neither have I.

1078
00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:48.341
I feel so safe with you.
Do you want me?

1079
00:57:48.424 --> 00:57:51.719
Ha. How you say "Twice now and
once in the shower" in French?

1080
00:57:51.802 --> 00:57:54.180
Wait here. I'm going
to the bathroom.

1081
00:57:54.263 --> 00:57:56.265
Make myself more comfortable.

1082
00:57:57.808 --> 00:57:59.185
You need some matches?

1083
00:57:59.268 --> 00:58:02.104
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

1084
00:58:03.939 --> 00:58:04.940
(Beep)

1085
00:58:05.024 --> 00:58:06.192
Hello, room service?

1086
00:58:06.275 --> 00:58:08.319
Send me up a bottle of honey
and some Red Bull.

1087
00:58:08.402 --> 00:58:09.362
(Breathing heavily)

1088
00:58:09.445 --> 00:58:10.446
(<i>La Vie En Rose</i> continues)

1089
00:58:10.529 --> 00:58:11.864
(Horn beeps, motorcycle passing)

1090
00:58:11.947 --> 00:58:13.949
(Whooshing, metallic clinking)

1091
00:58:27.004 --> 00:58:29.590
(Door buzzer)

1092
00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:39.558
Do you like it?

1093
00:58:39.642 --> 00:58:42.728
No wonder Lance Armstrong
came all the way here to ride a bike.

1094
00:58:43.854 --> 00:58:45.356
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

1095
00:58:45.439 --> 00:58:47.024
(Geneviève moaning softly)

1096
00:58:49.402 --> 00:58:50.736
CARTER: <i>Oui,</i> baby, <i>oui!</i>

1097
00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:53.072
(Meaning and kissing sounds)

1098
00:58:53.155 --> 00:58:55.074
CARTER: Oh, yeah.

1099
00:58:55.157 --> 00:58:59.453
CARTER: <i>Voulez…vous
coucher avec moi,</i> baby?

1100
00:58:59.537 --> 00:59:01.455
(Sighs) <i>Je t'aime.</i>

1101
00:59:01.539 --> 00:59:03.416
(Inhales sharply) <i>Voulez-vous.</i>

1102
00:59:03.499 --> 00:59:04.834
Oh, yeah.

1103
00:59:04.917 --> 00:59:07.628
<i>Je t'aime,</i> baby, <i>je t'aime!</i>

1104
00:59:10.464 --> 00:59:12.049
Freeze! Don't move!

1105
00:59:12.842 --> 00:59:16.011
- (Gunshot)
- CARTER: Ah! Shit! Damn!

1106
00:59:22.935 --> 00:59:24.395
- I'm shot.
- It's OK, it's OK.

1107
00:59:24.478 --> 00:59:25.771
It's just a flesh wound.
It's OK. Gen--

1108
00:59:25.855 --> 00:59:26.939
Geneviève, Geneviève,
let me help you.

1109
00:59:27.022 --> 00:59:27.940
- Let me help you, baby.
- LEE: I'm terribly sorry.

1110
00:59:28.023 --> 00:59:29.191
- I'm OK.
- Where you going?

1111
00:59:29.275 --> 00:59:31.110
(Whispering) Je--Damn.

1112
00:59:31.193 --> 00:59:33.446
So we even now, huh?
Is that it?

1113
00:59:33.529 --> 00:59:35.156
I shoot your girl,
you shoot my girl?

1114
00:59:35.239 --> 00:59:36.824
I was trying to save your life.

1115
00:59:36.907 --> 00:59:38.033
Well, you couldn't wait five minutes?

1116
00:59:38.117 --> 00:59:39.994
We--We was about to
make love, man!

1117
00:59:40.077 --> 00:59:40.995
And you ruin it.

1118
00:59:41.078 --> 00:59:44.248
They will be coming for us.
We have to get out of here now.

1119
00:59:44.331 --> 00:59:46.375
You hear that?
We have to get out of here now.

1120
00:59:46.459 --> 00:59:48.377
- Damn, Lee! Damn you.
- (Whispering) Sorry.

1121
00:59:48.461 --> 00:59:50.379
Next time I'm getting
my own damn room.

1122
00:59:52.715 --> 00:59:54.884
(Speaking French)
Get them out, George.

1123
00:59:54.967 --> 00:59:57.595
These people are danger,
they're bleeding.

1124
00:59:57.678 --> 00:59:59.221
How can you bring them
to our home?

1125
00:59:59.305 --> 01:00:01.974
Paulette, there is something
you should know.

1126
01:00:02.057 --> 01:00:03.726
I'm not what you think I am.

1127
01:00:03.809 --> 01:00:06.812
(Sniffs) Are you telling me you're gay?

1128
01:00:11.567 --> 01:00:15.362
(Whispering) I'm trying to tell you...
I'm an American spy.

1129
01:00:15.446 --> 01:00:16.989
Ha. You a spy?

1130
01:00:17.072 --> 01:00:19.074
Yes, I'm working undercover
with the police.

1131
01:00:19.158 --> 01:00:20.326
We're about to crack a big case!

1132
01:00:20.409 --> 01:00:23.120
Shut your mouth, George.
Not another word.

1133
01:00:23.204 --> 01:00:26.415
You're a stupid cab driver,
like your father was a stupid cab driver.

1134
01:00:26.499 --> 01:00:27.917
What kind of case could you crack?

1135
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.335
Can't talk about it.

1136
01:00:31.462 --> 01:00:35.591
From this moment on, don't ever ask me
about my business!

1137
01:00:36.801 --> 01:00:38.761
Come with me, schmuck. Now.

1138
01:00:38.844 --> 01:00:40.846
(Siren in distance)

1139
01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:46.811
We need to get out of the city.

1140
01:00:46.894 --> 01:00:50.064
We're not going anywhere
till you tell us exactly what's going on.

1141
01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:51.690
Did you steal that list
from the triads?

1142
01:00:51.774 --> 01:00:54.860
Geneviève, we cannot help you
until you tell us the truth.

1143
01:00:54.944 --> 01:00:56.946
Where is Shy Shen?

1144
01:00:58.030 --> 01:00:59.865
(Sighs) It's right here.

1145
01:01:01.826 --> 01:01:04.245
Holy mother of Jesus!
She's a man.

1146
01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:06.497
I went to second base
with a damn Frenchman.

1147
01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:08.374
(Pants) It's <i>The Crying Games.</i>

1148
01:01:08.457 --> 01:01:10.292
I'm <i>Brokeback Carter.</i> Oh, god.

1149
01:01:10.376 --> 01:01:12.086
I'm not a man. It's just a wig.

1150
01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:14.380
You sure about that? Huh?

1151
01:01:14.463 --> 01:01:16.131
Lee, go over there
and check the hardware.

1152
01:01:16.215 --> 01:01:18.425
If she got anything in her bag
bigger than a three-iron...

1153
01:01:18.509 --> 01:01:19.760
we gonna beat his ass!

1154
01:01:19.844 --> 01:01:22.388
I'm a woman, James.
A woman who needs a way out.

1155
01:01:22.471 --> 01:01:23.722
You have to help me.

1156
01:01:23.806 --> 01:01:25.766
- You have Shy Shen?
- No.

1157
01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:27.852
I am Shy Shen.

1158
01:01:35.526 --> 01:01:39.405
In ancient times, when the triads
would select new leaders...

1159
01:01:39.488 --> 01:01:42.324
whey would secretly tattoo
the names onto a woman...

1160
01:01:43.659 --> 01:01:46.495
a woman who could carry
the list of Shy Shen...

1161
01:01:46.579 --> 01:01:49.206
to the 35 provinces of China.

1162
01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:52.751
When her journey ended
and the new leaders were informed...

1163
01:01:52.835 --> 01:01:56.005
the woman would be beheaded
and buried forever.

1164
01:01:56.088 --> 01:01:58.465
No records, no witnesses.

1165
01:01:58.549 --> 01:02:00.259
What type of tradition is that?

1166
01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:02.469
Have these guys ever heard of
a damn fax machine?

1167
01:02:02.553 --> 01:02:05.389
Kenji made me do it,
said it was a great honor.

1168
01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:08.434
I wanted to do it for him.
For the brotherhood.

1169
01:02:08.517 --> 01:02:10.102
Then why did you
send the names to Han?

1170
01:02:10.185 --> 01:02:12.688
Because I thought the World Court
could protect me.

1171
01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:15.524
But now I see...nobody can.

1172
01:02:15.608 --> 01:02:17.943
You are messed up
in some weird shit, lady.

1173
01:02:18.027 --> 01:02:19.862
I mean man.
Whatever the hell you are.

1174
01:02:19.945 --> 01:02:21.280
I'm a woman!

1175
01:02:21.363 --> 01:02:24.658
And they will send a army to kill me.
To protect their way.

1176
01:02:24.742 --> 01:02:26.952
You know what?
We can't fight no army, Lee.

1177
01:02:27.036 --> 01:02:29.204
Who gonna protect me? I mean us?

1178
01:02:30.331 --> 01:02:31.373
I know a place.

1179
01:02:40.966 --> 01:02:43.302
I won't be here
when you come out. I'm sorry.

1180
01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:47.348
My wife says I can't be a spy,
that I have to be home for dinner.

1181
01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:50.684
The truth is I'm a driver.
Nothing more.

1182
01:02:50.768 --> 01:02:52.478
This is my destiny.

1183
01:02:52.561 --> 01:02:55.147
I will never know what it's like
to be an American.

1184
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:58.067
Never know what it feels like
to kill for no reason.

1185
01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:59.902
George, it's OK.

1186
01:03:00.861 --> 01:03:02.488
Thank you.

1187
01:03:02.571 --> 01:03:04.823
<i>Au revoir.</i> And good luck.

1188
01:03:04.907 --> 01:03:07.242
- GENEVIÈVE: <i>Au revoir.</i>
- LEE: Bye, George.

1189
01:03:07.326 --> 01:03:10.037
(Men chatting in French)

1190
01:03:15.626 --> 01:03:17.419
Minister Reynard.

1191
01:03:18.712 --> 01:03:19.797
We have it.

1192
01:03:22.257 --> 01:03:25.177
REYNARD: The Shy Shen list?
This is incredible.

1193
01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.553
Some people said it was a myth.

1194
01:03:26.637 --> 01:03:29.390
CARTER: Naw, it's no myth.
I've seen it. Felt it.

1195
01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:31.266
Kissed it.
But I didn't French kiss it.

1196
01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:33.310
You do understand
how dangerous this is?

1197
01:03:33.394 --> 01:03:34.770
I was gonna use protection.

1198
01:03:34.853 --> 01:03:36.605
Can we go to the police?

1199
01:03:36.689 --> 01:03:39.358
The triads control
too many of them here.

1200
01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:41.777
We have to get you
out of the country.

1201
01:03:42.778 --> 01:03:44.071
Now, my dear...

1202
01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:48.033
would you mind taking off that wig
and showing us Shy Shen?

1203
01:03:48.117 --> 01:03:50.035
(Whispering) We never
told him she was the list.

1204
01:03:55.666 --> 01:04:01.255
Look at that. 13 names linked
to centuries of tradition.

1205
01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:04.508
The only real proof
that their secret world exists.

1206
01:04:07.636 --> 01:04:09.513
(Speaking Mandarin)

1207
01:04:11.974 --> 01:04:13.600
Ugh!

1208
01:04:13.684 --> 01:04:15.436
Geneviève, get their guns.

1209
01:04:21.316 --> 01:04:24.987
(Shouts in French)

1210
01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:26.989
I told you he was bad.
Didn't I tell you?

1211
01:04:27.072 --> 01:04:28.741
No.

1212
01:04:28.824 --> 01:04:29.908
Well, I was thinkin' it.

1213
01:04:29.992 --> 01:04:31.326
The explosion at the embassy.

1214
01:04:31.410 --> 01:04:33.078
As head of
the World Criminal Court...

1215
01:04:33.162 --> 01:04:35.330
it would make sense
for me to be a target.

1216
01:04:35.414 --> 01:04:36.915
Why did you come to my room?

1217
01:04:36.999 --> 01:04:39.168
Geneviève was going to be killed.

1218
01:04:39.251 --> 01:04:43.547
Having you die in the crossfire
would put an end to the investigation.

1219
01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:45.841
Now, it will end another way.

1220
01:04:45.924 --> 01:04:49.053
Ha ha. It's over, Reynard.

1221
01:04:49.136 --> 01:04:51.597
You know what it's like
for old men in prison?

1222
01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.683
They call you "pops."
They make you work in the library.

1223
01:04:54.767 --> 01:04:57.102
Your best friend? Gonna be a mouse.

1224
01:04:57.186 --> 01:04:58.854
(Phone ringing)

1225
01:04:58.937 --> 01:05:02.066
- I'm not going to prison.
- (Ringing continues)

1226
01:05:02.149 --> 01:05:04.318
You have a phone call, Inspector.

1227
01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:06.361
(Ringing continues)

1228
01:05:10.491 --> 01:05:12.618
KENJI, OVER SPEAKER:
Hello, brother.

1229
01:05:12.701 --> 01:05:14.411
I'd like to make a trade.

1230
01:05:14.495 --> 01:05:18.332
Some friends of mine came across
something in Los Angeles.

1231
01:05:18.415 --> 01:05:20.876
Something very valuable.

1232
01:05:21.877 --> 01:05:23.462
(Panting) Lee.

1233
01:05:23.545 --> 01:05:25.589
Help me, please.

1234
01:05:28.592 --> 01:05:30.219
Do we understand each other?

1235
01:05:30.302 --> 01:05:31.386
What do you want?

1236
01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:33.138
Shy Shen.

1237
01:05:33.222 --> 01:05:36.058
You and Geneviève
will meet me alone tonight.

1238
01:05:36.141 --> 01:05:40.646
If I see your partner
or any other cops, the girl dies.

1239
01:05:41.522 --> 01:05:42.689
Where?

1240
01:05:42.773 --> 01:05:47.945
Jules Verne restaurant, midnight.
Don't be late.

1241
01:05:48.028 --> 01:05:49.154
(Beep)

1242
01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.021
(Speaking French)

1243
01:06:57.472 --> 01:07:00.058
Welcome to the party, Lee.

1244
01:07:01.185 --> 01:07:03.687
Tonight we celebrate
the return of Shy Shen...

1245
01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:06.690
and the return of my brother.

1246
01:07:06.773 --> 01:07:08.442
Where is Soo Yung?

1247
01:07:16.491 --> 01:07:17.659
Ungh.

1248
01:07:25.334 --> 01:07:26.919
This sword has a past.

1249
01:07:27.002 --> 01:07:30.672
And like ours, it has seen
much pain, much blood.

1250
01:07:30.756 --> 01:07:32.424
- (Slashing)
- Urgh!

1251
01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:38.222
Hundreds of years ago
the triads would kill their enemies...

1252
01:07:38.305 --> 01:07:40.599
with 100 cuts to the body.

1253
01:07:40.682 --> 01:07:44.144
They would be very careful to avoid
any major arteries...

1254
01:07:44.228 --> 01:07:47.940
so that the victim would stay alive
for as long as possible.

1255
01:07:49.191 --> 01:07:52.736
You have just experienced
your first cut.

1256
01:07:53.737 --> 01:07:55.989
If anything happens to Soo Yung--

1257
01:07:57.449 --> 01:08:01.036
You could never kill me, Lee.
We both know that.

1258
01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:03.163
You know nothing about me.

1259
01:08:03.247 --> 01:08:07.876
I know you have no wife,
no children, no family.

1260
01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:11.296
Your life ended when we were kids,
back in Chenzhou.

1261
01:08:16.718 --> 01:08:19.763
You have nothing. Just like me.

1262
01:08:20.889 --> 01:08:22.808
CARTER: I wouldn't say nothin'!

1263
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:29.648
He has me.

1264
01:08:29.731 --> 01:08:31.942
His brother from another mother.

1265
01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:39.825
Where is she?

1266
01:08:39.908 --> 01:08:41.702
Enjoying the view.

1267
01:08:45.414 --> 01:08:46.581
Soo Yung!

1268
01:08:46.665 --> 01:08:48.292
Lee!

1269
01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:51.420
Help.

1270
01:08:53.672 --> 01:08:54.881
Let her go.

1271
01:08:54.965 --> 01:08:56.466
What the hell is wrong with you?

1272
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:58.051
Do you wanna die, Kenji?

1273
01:08:58.135 --> 01:08:59.761
CARTER: Get her in here!

1274
01:09:00.721 --> 01:09:02.556
Carter, drop the gun.

1275
01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:04.016
Get her off that damn rope,
or I'm shootin' you...

1276
01:09:04.099 --> 01:09:05.726
and the damn Temptations.

1277
01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:06.935
CARTER: Right now!

1278
01:09:08.145 --> 01:09:10.814
- (Machinery whirring)
- Oh, no! Lee!

1279
01:09:12.399 --> 01:09:13.692
SOO YUNG: Lee.

1280
01:09:13.775 --> 01:09:15.444
- Do it!
- Put her down!

1281
01:09:15.527 --> 01:09:17.112
CARTER: I'm serious!

1282
01:09:18.238 --> 01:09:19.573
I'm not playin'!

1283
01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:22.159
You ain't my damn brother.

1284
01:09:22.242 --> 01:09:23.327
Kenji.

1285
01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:25.329
- Drop the gun.
- No.

1286
01:09:25.412 --> 01:09:26.496
Drop it, Carter.

1287
01:09:27.539 --> 01:09:28.999
(Whispering) Shit.

1288
01:09:29.082 --> 01:09:30.751
Damn it.

1289
01:09:35.005 --> 01:09:36.965
- Tonight I lose a brother.
- SOO YUNG: Aah!

1290
01:09:44.681 --> 01:09:46.224
CARTER: Get him, Lee!

1291
01:09:48.185 --> 01:09:49.895
CARTER: Gonna get your
ass kicked, Kenji.

1292
01:10:02.574 --> 01:10:04.534
CARTER: Come on, kill him already!

1293
01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:15.003
Lee, he might be your brother,
but turn him into your sister.

1294
01:10:31.686 --> 01:10:32.729
CARTER: Watch out!

1295
01:10:35.148 --> 01:10:36.650
(Wind howling)

1296
01:10:37.651 --> 01:10:39.236
CARTER: Yeah!

1297
01:10:39.319 --> 01:10:41.029
Bring your little ass here.
Come here.

1298
01:10:43.782 --> 01:10:45.867
Aaaargh.

1299
01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:47.285
Give me your hand.

1300
01:10:52.082 --> 01:10:53.583
Nnngh!

1301
01:10:56.294 --> 01:10:58.713
KENJI: Ah! (Panting)

1302
01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:02.509
- Grrrah!
- Aaaah!

1303
01:11:03.677 --> 01:11:06.346
CARTER: Lee? Lee!

1304
01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:08.640
- Gnn!
- CARTER: Hold on, I'm comin'!

1305
01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.941
Get the hell off me.

1306
01:11:24.364 --> 01:11:25.574
Oh.

1307
01:11:36.334 --> 01:11:38.003
- Yeah, Lee!
- (Triads yelling)

1308
01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:40.672
Whoo!

1309
01:11:41.756 --> 01:11:42.924
Whoa!

1310
01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.506
CARTER: Yaaaaah!

01:12:28.803 --> 01:12:30.388
Ah! Ahhhh!

1312
01:12:30.472 --> 01:12:32.849
Ahh...ah...

1313
01:12:32.933 --> 01:12:34.768
Ahhhh! God da--

1314
01:13:08.009 --> 01:13:09.386
Enough, Kenji!

1315
01:13:09.469 --> 01:13:11.137
Grrrargh!

1316
01:13:18.937 --> 01:13:21.356
BOTH: Aaaaah!

1317
01:13:29.155 --> 01:13:31.741
Rrrraaaargh!

1318
01:13:40.041 --> 01:13:41.418
Rrrraargh!

1319
01:13:42.669 --> 01:13:44.921
Hoh hoh hoh hoh

1322

BOTH: Aaaaah!

1324
01:14:06.818 --> 01:14:09.321
What are you waiting for? Do it!

1325
01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:14.492
Ah!

1326
01:14:16.244 --> 01:14:17.829
Ungh!

1327
01:14:22.542 --> 01:14:24.169
Let go.

1328
01:14:24.252 --> 01:14:25.629
Or we're both gonna die.

1329
01:14:25.712 --> 01:14:27.339
No! I can save you.

1330
01:14:28.256 --> 01:14:30.258
Ungh. Grrn.

1331
01:14:34.471 --> 01:14:35.805
Guh.

1332
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:38.516
Goodbye, Lee.

1333
01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:39.851
No, Kenji!

1334
01:14:44.314 --> 01:14:46.483
No!

1338
01:15:04.459 --> 01:15:05.627
Unh.

Oh, my God!

1344
01:15:25.730 --> 01:15:28.233
What the hell am I doin' up here? (Sobs)

1345
01:15:29.567 --> 01:15:31.319
Aah! Help.

1346
01:15:34.406 --> 01:15:36.825
Stay cool, lady.
This doesn't have to end this way.

1347
01:15:38.243 --> 01:15:40.870
Don't do it. Don't do it, lady.

1348
01:15:40.954 --> 01:15:42.706
Don't you do it!

1349
01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:44.999
Think about what you doin'.

1350
01:15:45.083 --> 01:15:46.543

CARTER: Hey. Hey!

1353
01:15:51.047 --> 01:15:53.425
Would you like to know a secret, cop?

1354
01:15:53.508 --> 01:15:55.343
No.

1355
01:15:55.427 --> 01:15:57.262
(Panting)

1356
01:15:57.345 --> 01:15:58.638
Please.

Aaah! Oh, no! No!

Lee! You shoulda seen us, man.
We whupped their ass.

Soo Yung!

1371
01:16:43.475 --> 01:16:45.143
I'm OK.

CARTER: Oh, shit!

1374
01:16:50.106 --> 01:16:51.566
Call the police.

1375
01:17:26.768 --> 01:17:27.769
Ungh!

01:17:40.698 --> 01:17:42.784

Whoa-oa! Whoa!

Rah! Hah! Carter!

Ah! Yaaaaah!

- I got you!
- Black people don't fly.

1389
01:18:09.018 --> 01:18:10.687
Get me up. Get me up.

1390
01:18:10.770 --> 01:18:12.730
Come on, man. Hurry up.

1391
01:18:12.814 --> 01:18:14.065
Ungh.

1392
01:18:14.148 --> 01:18:17.068
Oh! Lee! Get me outta here!

01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:20.238
Ungh. Argh. Ah.

01:18:20.321 --> 01:18:21.406
Don't let go of that flag!

1395
01:18:21.489 --> 01:18:23.116

Oh, dear Lord, please!
Baby Jesus, help us!

Get this thing off me, Lee!

1415

1416
01:19:28.973 --> 01:19:31.726
I'm not constipated anymore.

1417
01:19:31.809 --> 01:19:34.729
(Both panting and gasping)

1418
01:19:41.194 --> 01:19:43.237
Put your hands up.

1419
01:19:43.321 --> 01:19:44.405
Geneviève.

1420
01:19:44.489 --> 01:19:46.658
Hey, man, you're the head
of the World Court.

1421
01:19:46.741 --> 01:19:48.952
What you gonna do,
shoot us down like animals?

1422
01:19:49.035 --> 01:19:50.328
We're police officers.

1423
01:19:50.411 --> 01:19:53.206
Yes. And you two
just killed this girl.

1424
01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:54.707
REYNARD: Blew her brains out.

1425
01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:57.877

1426
01:19:57.961 --> 01:19:59.754
(Gunshot)

1427
01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.734
Carter.

1428
01:20:21.818 --> 01:20:22.819
You all right?

1430
01:20:24.445 --> 01:20:26.197
I followed you.

1431
01:20:28.157 --> 01:20:30.451
Case closed.

1432
01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:35.331
(Police radio chatter)

1433
01:20:37.375 --> 01:20:39.043
Good job, man.

1434
01:20:49.846 --> 01:20:51.556
Hey, man! You touch me again...

Congratulations.

1437
01:20:54.434 --> 01:20:57.478
It appears we have finally
brought down the triads.

1438
01:20:57.562 --> 01:20:59.230
- We?!
- You didn't do shit.

1439
01:20:59.313 --> 01:21:00.648
My butt still hurts.

1440
01:21:01.691 --> 01:21:03.151
The Americans and the French...

1441
01:21:03.234 --> 01:21:05.820
need to work together
in the spirit of brotherhood.

1442
01:21:05.903 --> 01:21:07.780
Together, we can do anything.

1443
01:21:07.864 --> 01:21:09.449
Anything! Ha ha ha.

1444
01:21:09.532 --> 01:21:11.576
He's right, Lee.
Together, we can do anything.

1445
01:21:11.659 --> 01:21:12.660
You go this way...

1446
01:21:12.744 --> 01:21:14.287
