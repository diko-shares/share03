1
00:01:16.387 --> 00:01:17.087
Ok.

2
00:01:18.248 --> 00:01:19.385
I like this.

3
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.911
Maybe this time,
we get lucky and make a baby?

4
00:01:21.912 --> 00:01:23.542
Let's just have some fun.

5
00:01:23.906 --> 00:01:25.045
Oh I like fun.

6
00:01:25.302 --> 00:01:26.952
Just shut up and kiss me.

7
00:01:32.564 --> 00:01:33.564
Sorry.

8
00:01:33.765 --> 00:01:34.565
Hold on.

9
00:01:34.893 --> 00:01:36.438
That damn watch.

10
00:01:39.252 --> 00:01:40.309
Come on.

11
00:01:47.494 --> 00:01:48.494
What's wrong.

12
00:01:53.395 --> 00:01:54.458
You feel that?

13
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.630
No.

14
00:02:01.752 --> 00:02:02.752
It stopped.

15
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.671
That's weird, I didn't feel anything.

16
00:02:07.598 --> 00:02:08.705
Baby are you ok?

17
00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.275
Yeah, I'm ok.

18
00:02:11.633 --> 00:02:12.833
Ok but what the hell was that?

19
00:02:13.896 --> 00:02:15.108
Oh my God, look?

20
00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:16.663
Look out there.

21
00:02:18.548 --> 00:02:19.674
What is that?

22
00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:23.258
<i>There he is.</i>

23
00:02:23.386 --> 00:02:25.638
<i>Hello. How's our little guy
this morning?</i>

24
00:02:26.638 --> 00:02:28.805
<i>Hello, how are you?</i>

25
00:02:29.672 --> 00:02:30.615
<i>Oh look at you!</i>

26
00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:32.241
<i>Look at you!
You are all sitting up!</i>

27
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:34.726
<i>Here, kick it.</i>

28
00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.117
<i>Look at that big smile!</i>

29
00:02:44.218 --> 00:02:45.715
<i>So happy!</i>

30
00:02:51.318 --> 00:02:53.034
<i>You are crawling. Look at him crawl.</i>

31
00:02:53.835 --> 00:02:54.935
<i>Look at him crawl.</i>

32
00:02:55.714 --> 00:02:57.787
<i>Look at these overalls.
He's like a mini you.</i>

33
00:03:01.536 --> 00:03:03.889
<i>Look at you putting your
little butt in the air.</i>

34
00:03:04.445 --> 00:03:06.804
<i>Yeah, you are gonna work
on the farm like daddy.</i>

35
00:03:06.805 --> 00:03:08.877
<i>Yes. Just like a Breyer.</i>

36
00:03:15.318 --> 00:03:17.451
<i>Brandon, I'm gonna turn this off.
Say, Bye.</i>

37
00:03:17.652 --> 00:03:18.312
<i>Bye.</i>

38
00:03:36.635 --> 00:03:37.435
Brandon.

39
00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:45.576
It's time to get ready for school.

40
00:03:51.538 --> 00:03:52.538
Gotcha!

41
00:04:05.834 --> 00:04:07.180
Not even close!

42
00:04:10.274 --> 00:04:11.431
I'm gonna find you.

43
00:04:13.217 --> 00:04:14.680
Better not be in that barn.

44
00:05:12.564 --> 00:05:14.183
You totally got me!

45
00:05:14.853 --> 00:05:17.008
You are getting too big for this.

46
00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:21.644
But you'll always be my baby boy.

47
00:05:23.936 --> 00:05:24.936
Ok, let's go.

48
00:05:25.187 --> 00:05:26.478
Took you long enough to find me.

49
00:05:30.903 --> 00:05:32.034
Morning guys.

50
00:05:32.271 --> 00:05:33.771
Hey.
What were you doing in there?

51
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.477
I was just hiding and stuff.

52
00:05:35.586 --> 00:05:37.828
You know the rules on the barn right?

53
00:05:37.957 --> 00:05:38.857
Yeah, I mean..

54
00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:42.187
Come on, all those boards and nails and shit,
don't want you breaking your neck.

55
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.536
He was only in there for like two minutes.

56
00:05:45.829 --> 00:05:46.909
Did you get breakfast?

57
00:05:47.026 --> 00:05:48.026
Not yet.

58
00:05:48.057 --> 00:05:48.925
Want some waffles?

59
00:05:49.226 --> 00:05:50.767
Yeah sounds good.
You are making waffles?

60
00:05:50.768 --> 00:05:52.024
Yeah I'm making waffles this morning.

61
00:05:52.025 --> 00:05:53.116
What about some bacon?

62
00:05:55.475 --> 00:05:58.700
And that is what we call a hive.

63
00:06:00.445 --> 00:06:02.609
Wasps and bees.

64
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.898
Both members of the same insect family,

65
00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:07.649
both with two pairs of wings,
both with stingers.

66
00:06:07.977 --> 00:06:10.352
Can anyone tell me any
differences between them?

67
00:06:16.902 --> 00:06:17.913
Mr. Breyer?

68
00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:21.082
Well...

69
00:06:21.383 --> 00:06:24.441
bees are pollinators and
wasps are predators.

70
00:06:24.725 --> 00:06:26.382
Good, good. Anybody else?

71
00:06:26.383 --> 00:06:29.617
And wasps are more aggressive,
more dangerous,

72
00:06:30.194 --> 00:06:34.128
one species the Polistes Sulcifer
is what's called a brood parasite,

73
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.376
they've lost the ability to make nests so,

74
00:06:36.377 --> 00:06:40.230
they use brute force to make other
wasp species raise their young,

75
00:06:40.527 --> 00:06:44.250
and they make them feed their babies
things like beetle larvae and maggots.

76
00:06:45.181 --> 00:06:47.198
Bro, why you are always talking
about maggots?

77
00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:48.073
You must be one.

78
00:06:49.865 --> 00:06:51.111
Ok. Alright.

79
00:06:51.675 --> 00:06:52.648
Don't worry,

80
00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:54.568
smart guys end up ruling the planet.

81
00:09:28.862 --> 00:09:29.862
Brandon?

82
00:09:36.297 --> 00:09:37.297
Brandon?

83
00:09:50.804 --> 00:09:51.804
Brandon?

84
00:10:04.751 --> 00:10:05.751
Brandon?

85
00:10:31.016 --> 00:10:32.016
Brandon.

86
00:10:37.931 --> 00:10:38.931
Brandon.

87
00:10:42.797 --> 00:10:43.797
Brandon.

88
00:10:46.053 --> 00:10:47.053
Brandon.

89
00:10:50.381 --> 00:10:51.381
Brandon.

90
00:10:54.766 --> 00:10:55.766
Brandon.

91
00:10:56.267 --> 00:10:56.967
Hey.

92
00:10:57.068 --> 00:10:57.568
Hey.

93
00:10:59.669 --> 00:11:00.269
Hey.

94
00:11:01.228 --> 00:11:02.540
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.
What's going on, where am I?

95
00:11:02.541 --> 00:11:03.152
It's me.

96
00:11:03.153 --> 00:11:05.013
It's mom. It's mom, mom.
Look at me.

97
00:11:05.314 --> 00:11:06.312
Ok. You are alright.

98
00:11:06.613 --> 00:11:07.750
You are alright. You are alright.

99
00:11:09.989 --> 00:11:10.989
You are alright.

100
00:11:13.386 --> 00:11:15.313
You are alright.
You were sleepwalking I think.

101
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:16.941
Yeah I was...

102
00:11:17.242 --> 00:11:18.473
There was...

103
00:11:18.474 --> 00:11:19.350
This voices or...

104
00:11:19.651 --> 00:11:20.651
or something...

105
00:11:21.196 --> 00:11:21.896
I know.

106
00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:22.997
You are ok now.

107
00:11:23.498 --> 00:11:24.523
You are ok now.

108
00:11:25.424 --> 00:11:26.224

Yeah he was...

121
00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.050
Sleepwalking I guess?

122
00:12:20.276 --> 00:12:21.276
Where?

123
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:24.484
No, just... He was downstairs.

124
00:12:24.585 --> 00:12:25.713
He is, he is fine.

125
00:12:27.298 --> 00:12:29.246
We should go to bed, yeah?

126
00:12:29.347 --> 00:12:30.531
It's getting so late.

127
00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:34.497
Hold underneath.
Keep it stiff. There you go, ok.

128
00:12:37.026 --> 00:12:38.800
Alright, I think it's gonna hold it.

129
00:12:41.456 --> 00:12:42.540
Do you want one of these?

130
00:12:42.541 --> 00:12:43.275
Sure.

131
00:12:46.025 --> 00:12:47.990
First couple of years after
we adopted you,

132
00:12:49.252 --> 00:12:51.118
I had no clue how to be a dad.

133
00:12:51.786 --> 00:12:53.552
And your mom she was out one day,

134
00:12:53.553 --> 00:12:55.073
and you were balling your eyes out,

135
00:12:55.559 --> 00:12:56.806
but I had the secret weapon.

136
00:12:57.417 --> 00:12:59.689
So you gave me a piece of candy?

137
00:13:00.778 --> 00:13:01.778
Yep!

138
00:13:03.937 --> 00:13:04.978
Did it work?

139
00:13:05.515 --> 00:13:06.750
I guess.

140
00:13:06.751 --> 00:13:08.246
You didn't turn up that bad, did you?

141
00:13:11.711 --> 00:13:13.078
Alright, you gonna be able
to get the lawn?

142
00:13:13.079 --> 00:13:14.525
Because I gotta get to the seed store.

143
00:13:14.638 --> 00:13:16.159
Yeah, no worries, I'll handle it.

144
00:13:18.415 --> 00:13:19.126
Dammit.

145
00:13:22.436 --> 00:13:23.448
Come on.

146
00:13:27.748 --> 00:13:29.025
Stupid thing.

147
00:14:31.587 --> 00:14:33.437
Oh you are not beating me, I love it!
Oh, oh, fancy.

148
00:14:34.616 --> 00:14:36.395
You can't go that close.
That's how you shoot.

149
00:14:36.446 --> 00:14:38.706
What about this brown one?
I feel like he's easy to pick up.

150
00:14:38.755 --> 00:14:39.846
Right there, right there..
No!

151
00:14:39.962 --> 00:14:42.750
You were way in front of it.
You hit this too fast.

152
00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:44.540
Oh, this has to be it.
Come on.

153
00:14:49.352 --> 00:14:53.083
♪ <i>Happy birthday, dear Brandon.</i> ♪

154
00:14:53.584 --> 00:14:57.521

Hey. Look at that.

156
00:14:59.067 --> 00:15:00.161
There you go.

157
00:15:01.683 --> 00:15:02.924
This is for little kids.

158
00:15:02.925 --> 00:15:05.501
Oh come on, make a wish!
Thank you Erica.

159
00:15:05.602 --> 00:15:07.510
I didn't think they were gonna
bring it. It's pretty nice.

160
00:15:07.511 --> 00:15:10.462
Yeah, if you don't want it, slide it
on over here, you know I'll take it.

161
00:15:10.963 --> 00:15:11.963
Go on.

162
00:15:14.864 --> 00:15:15.464
There we go.

163
00:15:15.465 --> 00:15:17.448
So Brandon I hear you
are killing it in school.

164
00:15:17.458 --> 00:15:18.990
He tested in the top 1%.

165
00:15:19.052 --> 00:15:22.086
No he tested in the top 1/10th of 1%.

166
00:15:22.215 --> 00:15:24.646
Yeah the whole faculty
it's talking about him.

167
00:15:24.806 --> 00:15:26.247
He is our little secret genius.

168
00:15:26.668 --> 00:15:28.686
So a special guy,

169
00:15:28.687 --> 00:15:30.811
deserves a very special present,

170
00:15:31.144 --> 00:15:34.637
this is from me and your aunt Merilee.

171
00:15:36.208 --> 00:15:37.606
Go ahead open it!

172
00:15:38.328 --> 00:15:41.083
I shot my first buck with
that very same model.

173
00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:42.691
Cool.

174
00:15:43.883 --> 00:15:45.563
No, no, no. No guns!

175
00:15:45.672 --> 00:15:47.483
We talked about this Tori.
I know, but...

176
00:15:47.556 --> 00:15:49.579
No, come on, he's still just a kid.

177
00:15:50.168 --> 00:15:50.976
I'm 12 years old.

178
00:15:50.989 --> 00:15:53.594
I know, exactly you are still a child.

179
00:15:54.878 --> 00:15:55.889
Give it to me.

180
00:15:56.762 --> 00:15:58.421
I'm sorry, what did you just say to me?

181
00:15:58.592 --> 00:16:00.555
I said. Give it to me!

182
00:16:02.002 --> 00:16:03.013
Brandon.

183
00:16:03.089 --> 00:16:04.364
Ok, we are done here.

184
00:16:04.365 --> 00:16:06.138
We're not having ice cream,
thank you so much.

185
00:16:06.139 --> 00:16:07.125
Brandon, let's go.

186
00:16:07.643 --> 00:16:08.843
Brandon, let's go!

187
00:16:08.944 --> 00:16:09.604
Brandon!

188
00:16:10.312 --> 00:16:11.456
Up! Now!

189
00:16:11.658 --> 00:16:12.377
Brandon.

190
00:16:12.878 --> 00:16:14.445
Listen to your father.

191
00:16:16.335 --> 00:16:18.147
We are leaving. Let's go.
Love you guys.

192
00:16:18.521 --> 00:16:19.814
I love you. I'm sorry.
So fun. Thank you.

193
00:16:19.815 --> 00:16:21.347
Let's go.
Thank you so much. Call me later.

194
00:16:21.515 --> 00:16:22.266
Ok.

195
00:16:22.667 --> 00:16:23.298
Sorry.

196
00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:25.169
Don't even worry about it.
I'm so sorry.

197
00:16:27.985 --> 00:16:29.340
I love you, guys.

198
00:16:30.811 --> 00:16:33.866
Babe, I've told you.
Are you sure you want kids?

199
00:16:34.476 --> 00:16:36.141
I just don't get that kid.

200
00:16:36.469 --> 00:16:38.796
Turns 12, all of a sudden,
he has a mouth on him?

201
00:16:38.797 --> 00:16:41.088
It was so strange.
It was so unlike him.

202
00:16:42.682 --> 00:16:44.159
Don't worry about him.

203
00:16:45.244 --> 00:16:46.941
He is getting older. Changing.

204
00:16:47.822 --> 00:16:50.551
We were so much worse
when we were his age.

205
00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:54.161
Do you remember all the running
around we did, sneaking out,

206
00:16:54.369 --> 00:16:56.362
fooling around in my parents basement.

207
00:16:56.563 --> 00:16:57.166
Yeah.

208
00:16:57.507 --> 00:16:59.226
You know my parents knew exactly
what we were doing down there.

209
00:16:59.227 --> 00:16:59.807
Yeah.

210
00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.731
They just didn't give a shit. They had
already written me off at that point.

211
00:17:03.525 --> 00:17:04.425
Babe.

212
00:17:05.323 --> 00:17:07.909
We can never do that, to Brandon.

213
00:17:09.063 --> 00:17:11.532
He needs to know, we give a shit.

214
00:17:11.733 --> 00:17:12.733
He will know.

215
00:17:16.247 --> 00:17:18.032
Hey, why don't we go camping
this weekend?

216
00:17:18.667 --> 00:17:20.605
Just the three of us, go to Drywood.

217
00:17:21.358 --> 00:17:22.923
We haven't done that in so long.

218
00:17:23.412 --> 00:17:25.508
You know what else
we haven't done in a while.

219
00:17:26.955 --> 00:17:28.399
I know what you are thinking.

220
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.553
Gone to church.

221
00:17:30.654 --> 00:17:32.876
We have not gone to church in a while.
Too late. Yeah.

222
00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:35.762
That's not at all what
I was thinking about.

223
00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:39.840
We need to clean up the closet,
that's what you were thinking.

224
00:17:39.841 --> 00:17:40.852
No. No.

225
00:17:41.772 --> 00:17:44.323
Ok, but you got to be quite.
I will be quite, I'm always quite.

226
00:17:44.324 --> 00:17:45.674
He is not asleep yet.

227
00:17:49.686 --> 00:17:50.386
Here.

228
00:17:52.413 --> 00:17:53.746
What's that three or four?

229
00:17:53.747 --> 00:17:55.042
We've got three we are good.

230
00:17:55.043 --> 00:17:55.522
Ok.

231
00:17:55.523 --> 00:17:57.550
We are good.
Go get the flashlight.

232
00:18:01.274 --> 00:18:02.545
This needs batteries.

233
00:18:02.921 --> 00:18:06.168
Brandon, it's gonna be cold, you are
gonna need your warm jacket ok?

234
00:18:14.319 --> 00:18:16.106
Hey? Did you hear your mother bud?

235
00:18:20.107 --> 00:18:21.107
Hey?

236
00:18:28.052 --> 00:18:28.952
Brandon.

237
00:18:53.311 --> 00:18:54.311
Hey honey.

238
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.083
Look what I've found.

239
00:18:57.517 --> 00:18:58.528
What is that?

240
00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.599
Is that, like, his idea of porn?

241
00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.887
I think so.

242
00:19:02.888 --> 00:19:04.971
Bras..

243
00:19:05.085 --> 00:19:06.656
Guess we knew this day was coming.

244
00:19:08.035 --> 00:19:09.106
What the hell is that?

245
00:19:10.498 --> 00:19:12.184
It's this like a guy thing?

246
00:19:12.533 --> 00:19:14.614
No that's not any guy thing I know.

247
00:19:17.506 --> 00:19:19.448
Maybe we should have
a talk with him.

248
00:19:30.946 --> 00:19:32.027
Hey Brandon.

249
00:19:33.233 --> 00:19:35.104
You know you just had your birthday,

250
00:19:36.313 --> 00:19:39.454
winch means that you are
becoming a young man and...

251
00:19:40.312 --> 00:19:41.693
Your body is changing.

252
00:19:42.875 --> 00:19:43.821
Ok.

253
00:19:43.834 --> 00:19:45.857
Well, you might start developing,
you know...

254
00:19:47.766 --> 00:19:49.273
feelings about women,

255
00:19:49.374 --> 00:19:50.674
women's bodies...

256
00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:53.835
I was just like you when
I was your age.

257
00:19:54.777 --> 00:19:57.077
I also thought about girls all the time.

258
00:19:58.706 --> 00:20:00.906
Yeah you know, nobody
was around to tell me that...

259
00:20:02.076 --> 00:20:03.532
It was ok to...

260
00:20:05.033 --> 00:20:07.057
Touch it or play with it.

261
00:20:08.782 --> 00:20:09.793
With what?

262
00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:13.937
You know with...

263
00:20:15.638 --> 00:20:16.774
Your penis.

264
00:20:19.312 --> 00:20:20.212
Ok.

265
00:20:21.043 --> 00:20:22.453
Look the thing about...

266
00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:24.310
you know sex it's not..

267
00:20:24.711 --> 00:20:27.475
It's not about organs or body parts...

268
00:20:27.957 --> 00:20:29.057
I mean...

269
00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:30.697
you know it is that too but..

270
00:20:32.247 --> 00:20:35.363
You know it's about finding the right
person and then falling in love.

271
00:20:38.525 --> 00:20:40.936
Look man, all I'm saying
is you are a guy,

272
00:20:41.437 --> 00:20:43.963
you know and you are gonna
have certain urges,

273
00:20:44.264 --> 00:20:49.327
you know about girls you see in films
or girls in class or whatever.

274
00:20:50.011 --> 00:20:53.434
And I'm just saying that it's ok
to give into them now and again.

275
00:20:54.924 --> 00:20:56.035
Like, now?

276
00:20:57.551 --> 00:20:58.562
What?

277
00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:01.509
Like now.

278
00:21:03.118 --> 00:21:04.127
No, no, no, not.

279
00:21:05.128 --> 00:21:06.643
Not right now. No.

280
00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:11.670
Good talk.

281
00:21:33.005 --> 00:21:34.016
Brandon.

282
00:23:03.358 --> 00:23:04.405
Mom!

283
00:23:14.315 --> 00:23:15.303
What's wrong?

284
00:23:15.304 --> 00:23:16.636
What's wrong? What's wrong?

285
00:23:17.412 --> 00:23:19.097
Someone's there behind the curtain.

286
00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:42.975
Honey there is no one here.

287
00:23:43.128 --> 00:23:45.578
No, you have to believe me.
He was right there.

288
00:23:46.366 --> 00:23:47.395
Who was?

289
00:23:48.724 --> 00:23:50.797
Brandon Breyer.

290
00:23:52.628 --> 00:23:53.613
Brandon?

291
00:23:58.963 --> 00:23:59.974
Brandon!

292
00:24:01.654 --> 00:24:03.188
Brandon where are you baby?

293
00:24:03.803 --> 00:24:04.991
Can you hear me?

294
00:24:05.447 --> 00:24:06.497
Brandon.

295
00:24:08.016 --> 00:24:09.061
Brandon!

296
00:24:12.264 --> 00:24:13.297
Oh my god.

297
00:24:13.298 --> 00:24:15.253
Oh my god Brandon..

298
00:24:15.254 --> 00:24:17.196
Your father and I are totally
freaked out!

299
00:24:17.197 --> 00:24:19.172
I didn't mean to,
I was just taking a pee.

300
00:24:28.704 --> 00:24:32.905
So you don't think I need to take
him to someone like a specialist...

301
00:24:33.306 --> 00:24:35.055
Because there is...
No. For what?

302
00:24:35.056 --> 00:24:37.086
For talking back to his dad
and keeping weird...

303
00:24:37.587 --> 00:24:39.892
jerk-off literature material under
his mattress?

304
00:24:40.051 --> 00:24:41.746
It's more than that, Mer.

305
00:24:41.847 --> 00:24:45.724
I don't know, it's like, he's always been,
you know, my little sweet guy and now...

306
00:24:47.437 --> 00:24:49.470
He is so different.
It's called puberty.

307
00:24:51.152 --> 00:24:52.764
So I'm overreacting?
A little.

308
00:24:52.965 --> 00:24:54.216
Alittle. A little bit.
Yeah.

309
00:24:54.417 --> 00:24:56.322
I love you.
Thank you.

310
00:24:56.523 --> 00:24:57.881
I'll call you.
Ok call me later, bye.

311
00:24:57.882 --> 00:24:58.882
Thanks, Mer.

312
00:25:06.822 --> 00:25:07.910
What's that?

313
00:25:09.156 --> 00:25:10.156
What?

314
00:25:10.499 --> 00:25:12.360
I wasn't snooping or anything.

315
00:25:13.134 --> 00:25:14.654
Most of the line work.

316
00:25:14.955 --> 00:25:15.985
It's good shading.

317
00:25:47.171 --> 00:25:48.489
Fucking wolf.

318
00:26:00.625 --> 00:26:01.697
Brandon?

319
00:26:01.998 --> 00:26:03.253
Hey, what are you doing, buddy?

320
00:26:13.081 --> 00:26:14.888
Buddy it's 10:30 at night.

321
00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:20.301
Are you alright buddy?

322
00:26:27.626 --> 00:26:28.626
Think so.

323
00:26:32.618 --> 00:26:33.818
Come on man, let's get inside.

324
00:27:03.867 --> 00:27:05.009
Oh my God.

325
00:27:05.599 --> 00:27:08.244
Tori, Tori, Tori, hey!

326
00:27:08.942 --> 00:27:10.209
Wake up.
What is it?

327
00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:11.428
I need you to come outside.

328
00:27:11.429 --> 00:27:11.939
Ok.

329
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:12.927
You see?

330
00:27:12.928 --> 00:27:14.320
Oh shit.
Right.

331
00:27:17.633 --> 00:27:18.961
So the wolf is back.

332
00:27:19.162 --> 00:27:20.654
No. No baby. I...

333
00:27:21.055 --> 00:27:22.268
This isn't a wolf, I mean,

334
00:27:22.869 --> 00:27:24.654
this isn't an animal, I think...

335
00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.217
I think this might be Brandon.

336
00:27:28.207 --> 00:27:29.733
He was out here early tonight,

337
00:27:29.834 --> 00:27:31.278
just staring at them.

338
00:27:31.578 --> 00:27:33.702
And the chicken they were
all fucking going crazy.

339
00:27:35.804 --> 00:27:37.599
Babe a wolf can't do this!

340
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.195
It can't rip a freaking door off open
and break a lock!

341
00:27:40.788 --> 00:27:42.470
But our And your twelve years
old son can?

342
00:27:43.075 --> 00:27:44.509
So you can't explain it either.

343
00:27:46.537 --> 00:27:48.717
Kyle stop, it was the wolf.

344
00:27:49.318 --> 00:27:50.344
I'm going to bed.

345
00:27:53.019 --> 00:27:55.493
Ok guys this came is called,
Willows in the wind.

346
00:27:55.672 --> 00:27:58.052
It's about walking together,
building trust.

347
00:27:58.341 --> 00:28:00.766
Lean back and depend
on your classmates.

348
00:28:03.457 --> 00:28:04.505
Come on, now focus.

349
00:28:08.003 --> 00:28:09.321
Alright, very good guys.

350
00:28:09.622 --> 00:28:11.201
When we trust each other,

351
00:28:11.502 --> 00:28:13.186
good things happen.

352
00:28:13.344 --> 00:28:15.355
Alright, you are our next big guy.
Let's hear it for Brandon.

353
00:28:15.444 --> 00:28:16.051
Loser.

354
00:28:16.652 --> 00:28:18.111
Nothing to be afraid of.

355
00:28:18.163 --> 00:28:19.670
Your classmates have your back.

356
00:28:26.646 --> 00:28:27.657
Good job.

357
00:28:29.753 --> 00:28:30.790
Oh shit!

358
00:28:31.921 --> 00:28:33.473
Way to trust the floor, Breyer.

359
00:28:33.574 --> 00:28:34.769
Hey, hey, knock it off!

360
00:28:35.165 --> 00:28:36.323
You ok bud?

361
00:28:37.124 --> 00:28:38.785
Dammit Caitlyn give him a hand up.

362
00:28:40.319 --> 00:28:42.363
Hey, hold on, we're all on
the same team here.

363
00:28:42.864 --> 00:28:43.882
He is a pervert!

364
00:28:45.097 --> 00:28:45.892
Liar.

365
00:28:45.974 --> 00:28:47.493
Caitlyn, help him up,
Idiot.

366
00:28:47.517 --> 00:28:49.483
Or you fail this class.

367
00:29:00.166 --> 00:29:01.233
What are you doing?

368
00:29:01.334 --> 00:29:02.334
Brandon.

369
00:29:02.415 --> 00:29:05.120
Let go. Stop it!
Brandon stop!

370
00:29:08.095 --> 00:29:10.223
Erica, he said he's sorry,

371
00:29:10.224 --> 00:29:12.546
it was an accident, they are just kids.

372
00:29:12.816 --> 00:29:14.937
Did you see my daughter's hand?

373
00:29:15.247 --> 00:29:17.418
He is a goddamn animal
is what he is.

374
00:29:17.474 --> 00:29:19.790
Can we just calm
down here, Erica please?

375
00:29:19.791 --> 00:29:21.570
I want him in handcuffs
and I want him gone.

376
00:29:21.607 --> 00:29:22.793
We are taking action,

377
00:29:22.794 --> 00:29:24.398
Brandon is going to be
suspended for two days.

378
00:29:24.514 --> 00:29:25.231
Suspended?

379
00:29:25.332 --> 00:29:26.900
Do your job, arrest him!

380
00:29:26.901 --> 00:29:28.812
I'm sorry ma'am, that's not your call.

381
00:29:28.877 --> 00:29:30.647
After the suspesion
he will be in regular

382
00:29:30.648 --> 00:29:32.725
sessions with our school
counselor miss Merilee.

383
00:29:32.872 --> 00:29:35.026
His aunt? Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

384
00:29:35.027 --> 00:29:37.467
Right now, she is the only counselor.
You know what?

385
00:29:37.567 --> 00:29:41.151
Her son was inside
my daughter's bedroom last Saturday.

386
00:29:41.196 --> 00:29:44.050
He wasn't, he was camping with us.
He's a pervert. He's sick!

387
00:29:44.074 --> 00:29:46.737
He was 30 miles away
from your house! Ok, Erica?

388
00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:50.244
You just can't admit there is
something so fucked-up about your kid.

389
00:29:50.338 --> 00:29:52.026
Do you even know
who his real mother is?

390
00:29:52.461 --> 00:29:53.464
I'm his real mother.

391
00:29:53.465 --> 00:29:55.850
I meant whatever inbred psycho
gave birth to him.

392
00:29:55.851 --> 00:29:56.551
Hey!

393
00:29:56.752 --> 00:29:58.201
I know exactly what you meant,

394
00:29:59.663 --> 00:30:03.693
If trash talking a 12 years old child,
lets you sleep better at night Erica.

395
00:30:04.495 --> 00:30:06.112
Maybe you are the one
who needs help.

396
00:30:09.141 --> 00:30:10.579
I'm sorry about your daughter.

397
00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:14.378
Get up, let's go.

398
00:30:29.659 --> 00:30:31.929
I never did shit like that,
breaking a girl's hand?

399
00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:33.051
Goddamn it.

400
00:30:34.464 --> 00:30:35.833
Dad would whup my ass.

401
00:30:37.388 --> 00:30:40.345
Yeah well, this isn't something
we can ass whip away.

402
00:30:41.546 --> 00:30:42.346
I just...

403
00:30:42.957 --> 00:30:44.501
I need to tell you something,

404
00:30:45.702 --> 00:30:47.140
the other night when I've found him,

405
00:30:47.341 --> 00:30:49.119
sleepwalking he wasn't...

406
00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:51.481
downstairs he was in the barn.

407
00:30:55.263 --> 00:30:56.362
Did he find it?

408
00:30:56.525 --> 00:30:58.629
No, no.

409
00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:01.656
But he was talking at the trapdoor.

410
00:31:02.153 --> 00:31:04.853
How does he even know what's in there?
I don't think he does. I...

411
00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.165
It was like he was drawn to it.

412
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.041
Babe, he may look like us and
sound like us,

413
00:31:10.502 --> 00:31:11.802
But he's never bled,

414
00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.532
not once in his whole life,

415
00:31:13.833 --> 00:31:15.333
he's never been cut or..

416
00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:17.219
Broken a bone or had a bruise.

417
00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.974
And now it's hurting people!

Baby.

454
00:34:01.955 --> 00:34:03.119
It cut me!

455
00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:08.654
Ok.

456
00:34:13.355 --> 00:34:14.622
You are gonna be ok.

457
00:34:14.907 --> 00:34:16.459
It'll be ok, ok, ok.

458
00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.924
It'll be ok.

Are you ok?

00:34:21.183 --> 00:34:22.257
Who am I?

461
00:34:32.711 --> 00:34:33.920
You're our son.

462
00:34:36.082 --> 00:34:37.081
What is this?

463
00:34:38.582 --> 00:34:40.094
Where did I come from?

464
00:34:41.651 --> 00:34:43.030
Listen baby, I...

465
00:34:43.531 --> 00:34:47.981
I know it's been difficult for you lately
that you feel different from other kids.

466
00:34:50.209 --> 00:34:51.363
You are different.

467
00:34:52.838 --> 00:34:57.388
After your dad and I got married we
prayed and prayed for a baby for so long,

468
00:34:59.071 --> 00:35:02.335
to God, to the universe or anyone
that was listening and then..

469
00:35:03.048 --> 00:35:04.599
One night, one...

470
00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.651
one perfect night,

471
00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:09.514
someone listened.

472
00:35:12.857 --> 00:35:14.870
We did not adopt you,

473
00:35:15.271 --> 00:35:16.817
from an agency.

474
00:35:18.715 --> 00:35:19.954
You came here,

475
00:35:21.155 --> 00:35:22.259
arrived here...

476
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.322
in that.

477
00:35:27.431 --> 00:35:28.979
We found you in the woods,

478
00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.713
you were just a little guy, all alone.

479
00:35:33.329 --> 00:35:35.403
You could barely breathe and so we...

480
00:35:35.704 --> 00:35:36.834
we took you in...

481
00:35:37.803 --> 00:35:40.162
and you've been a gift,

482
00:35:40.963 --> 00:35:42.448
my baby boy.

483
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.450
I... I can't even imagine how overwhelmed,

484
00:35:46.751 --> 00:35:47.978
you must feel right now.

485
00:35:48.686 --> 00:35:52.109
But you have to know that
your dad and I we believe,

486
00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:54.280
that you came here for a reason,

487
00:35:54.775 --> 00:35:56.722
that you are special,

488
00:35:57.023 --> 00:35:59.279
and that you, you are going
to do incredible...

489
00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.294
You lied to me!
We. We.

490
00:36:00.695 --> 00:36:02.320
We just wanted to take care of you...
No.

491
00:36:02.421 --> 00:36:05.259
And we always planned...
You lied to me! You lied!

492
00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:07.460
But, we...

493
00:36:07.733 --> 00:36:08.675
I hate you!

494
00:36:08.976 --> 00:36:10.090
You lied to me!

495
00:36:10.091 --> 00:36:12.693
You liars, everything! You lie!

496
00:36:12.694 --> 00:36:13.366
Hey, what?

497
00:36:13.367 --> 00:36:15.487
I hate you, I hate this place!
What's going on in here.

498
00:36:15.488 --> 00:36:16.437
Brandon.

499
00:36:17.338 --> 00:36:18.338
He found it.

500
00:36:22.033 --> 00:36:22.983
He found it.

501
00:36:23.384 --> 00:36:24.484
Take World.

00:36:24.885 --> 00:36:26.185

504
00:36:27.289 --> 00:36:29.123

505
00:36:29.497 --> 00:36:31.163
Take The World

506
00:36:32.164 --> 00:36:32.964

507
00:36:33.765 --> 00:36:35.165
Karu Ichikaru

508
00:36:35.745 --> 00:36:37.552
Take The World

509
00:36:38.053 --> 00:36:39.053
World

510
00:36:41.102 --> 00:36:42.158
Take the world.

511
00:37:02.863 --> 00:37:03.618
Don't scream.

512
00:37:05.319 --> 00:37:06.824
What are you doing here?

513
00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.649
I brought you flowers.

514
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:13.208
You can't be here.

515
00:37:14.645 --> 00:37:15.850
Don't be scared,

516
00:37:16.251 --> 00:37:17.724
I want to talk to you.

517
00:37:20.489 --> 00:37:22.400
I want to tell you what
I've learned tonight.

518
00:37:24.459 --> 00:37:25.663
I learned that...

519
00:37:26.064 --> 00:37:27.149
I'm very...

520
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:29.575
special.

521
00:37:31.868 --> 00:37:34.010
You are one of the only people
in the world that,

522
00:37:34.311 --> 00:37:36.047
knows how special I am.

523
00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.936
But someday...

524
00:37:40.437 --> 00:37:41.466
they will all know.

525
00:37:45.002 --> 00:37:47.104
My mom told me not to talk to you.

526
00:37:50.158 --> 00:37:51.518
I'm gonna take care of that.

527
00:38:07.155 --> 00:38:08.452
Have a good one Gary.

528
00:39:04.772 --> 00:39:06.644
Hey, who's messing with me?

529
00:39:10.403 --> 00:39:11.862
Is that you Gary?

530
00:40:30.044 --> 00:40:31.165
Get out of here!

531
00:40:36.962 --> 00:40:38.340
Leave me alone!

532
00:41:34.233 --> 00:41:35.233
Is he awake?

533
00:41:35.368 --> 00:41:38.649
I've called up two times already,
I heard him walking around.

534
00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:40.619
Should somebody go up,
and get him? I mean...

535
00:41:41.335 --> 00:41:42.260
Morning.

536
00:41:43.561 --> 00:41:44.668
Hey Bud.

537
00:41:45.796 --> 00:41:47.629
You know you are gonna
be late for school, right?

538
00:41:47.842 --> 00:41:50.086
Yeah I know I was,
I was just in my room,

539
00:41:50.087 --> 00:41:50.959
thinking.

540
00:41:52.428 --> 00:41:53.541
Thinking about what?

541
00:41:55.847 --> 00:41:57.236
Just about everything,

542
00:41:57.237 --> 00:41:58.082
and...

543
00:41:58.483 --> 00:41:59.501
It's totally cool.

544
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:03.939
I feel good.

545
00:42:06.449 --> 00:42:08.451
Well, I'm glad you feel that way, buddy.

546
00:42:08.452 --> 00:42:09.372
Me too.

547
00:42:09.886 --> 00:42:12.029
You know, why don't you grab a seat,
you know.

548
00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:13.846
Tell minutes late never killed
anyone, right?

549
00:42:18.918 --> 00:42:21.574
They say she hasn't responded to any...

550
00:42:21.975 --> 00:42:23.059
calls or texts.

551
00:42:23.747 --> 00:42:24.858
That's correct.

552
00:42:26.059 --> 00:42:27.553
This is the last place she was seen.

553
00:42:30.512 --> 00:42:32.235
It doesn't look like a robbery.

554
00:42:42.792 --> 00:42:43.824
Good God.

555
00:42:46.109 --> 00:42:47.390
Did you talk to her daughter?

556
00:42:48.648 --> 00:42:50.231
She is a mess right now.

557
00:42:50.632 --> 00:42:51.974
Scared shitless.

558
00:42:53.549 --> 00:42:55.000
I couldn't get two words out of her.

559
00:42:56.588 --> 00:42:57.599
What is that?

560
00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:14.836
So, I know this is kind of strange,

561
00:43:15.137 --> 00:43:17.515
I'm your aunt and I'm also
your counselor but,

562
00:43:17.516 --> 00:43:20.797
I'm the only one, the district has
got so you are stuck with me.

563
00:43:22.142 --> 00:43:24.771
So Brandon your mom
tells me that you've been

564
00:43:24.772 --> 00:43:27.471
having some issues lately
about being adopted.

565
00:43:29.427 --> 00:43:31.712
Nothing bad, only good ones.

566
00:43:31.713 --> 00:43:33.245
Really? How so?

567
00:43:34.696 --> 00:43:35.968
I've realized I'm special,

568
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:40.422
because my real parents
aren't from a stupid place like here.

569
00:43:40.505 --> 00:43:43.701
Brandon you don't think of your
mom and dad as your real parents?

570
00:43:43.737 --> 00:43:46.524
I do, I just know I'm something else,

571
00:43:47.025 --> 00:43:48.596
something superior.

572
00:43:53.392 --> 00:43:54.490
Brandon,

573
00:43:54.891 --> 00:43:58.036
do you feel bad about what
you did to Caitlyn?

574
00:44:01.664 --> 00:44:02.672
You know,

575
00:44:03.573 --> 00:44:04.753
sometimes...

576
00:44:05.154 --> 00:44:08.108
when bad things happen
to people, it's for a good reason.

577
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:15.134
Brandon, part of my job,

578
00:44:15.135 --> 00:44:18.260
is to update the school and update
your mom on your progress

579
00:44:18.388 --> 00:44:22.069
and let them know if you are showing
any growth of remorse and I..

580
00:44:22.436 --> 00:44:24.264
I can't take it easy on you because...

581
00:44:25.765 --> 00:44:26.869
you are my family.

582
00:44:29.077 --> 00:44:31.684
Brandon, I'm giving you an
opportunity to talk to me.

583
00:44:32.154 --> 00:44:35.899
I'm supposed to update the sheriff tomorrow
and I have to be honest with him.

584
00:44:48.516 --> 00:44:50.741
Yeah my buddy said the diner was just...

585
00:44:51.568 --> 00:44:53.769
was just wrecked
and the waitress Erica was gone.

586
00:44:53.976 --> 00:44:55.253
It's been 24 hours.

587
00:44:56.348 --> 00:44:58.079
Kyle, do you think your son
could've done it?

588
00:44:59.204 --> 00:45:02.156
Dude. What?
He crushed her daughter's hand.

589
00:45:02.265 --> 00:45:03.633
This is not funny right now, ok?

590
00:45:04.382 --> 00:45:05.393
Ok, I'm sorry.

591
00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:06.500
So...

592
00:45:07.001 --> 00:45:08.856
what is gonna happen with all that.
I don't know,

593
00:45:09.057 --> 00:45:10.870
he got suspended for a few days and...

594
00:45:10.971 --> 00:45:14.693
I'm sure I'm gonna get a call from some lawyer
telling me that my son's a monster, winch...

595
00:45:14.994 --> 00:45:16.491
I don't know anymore, maybe he is.

596
00:45:16.636 --> 00:45:18.722
Yeah, they are all monsters,
I'm going home.

597
00:45:18.882 --> 00:45:20.372
Come on! One more.

598
00:45:20.373 --> 00:45:21.516
One more, come on!

599
00:45:21.517 --> 00:45:23.765
No, no, I got to get home
or Merilee is gonna kill me.

600
00:45:23.778 --> 00:45:25.537
Yeah, come on, I'll drive you.
It's just a few miles down the road, ok.

601
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:26.672
No, hang on I'll drive.

602
00:45:27.173 --> 00:45:28.885
Mommy, I'm ok.

603
00:45:31.114 --> 00:45:32.205
Brandon.

604
00:45:35.678 --> 00:45:37.801
I'm home, I've got sesame chicken.

605
00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.211
Brandon?

606
00:46:11.442 --> 00:46:12.442

Hey.

611
00:47:18.527 --> 00:47:20.612
Brandon, Jesus.

612
00:47:20.913 --> 00:47:22.212
What are you doing here?

613
00:47:22.667 --> 00:47:23.842
I need to talk to you.

614
00:47:24.143 --> 00:47:25.600
I know it's late,

615
00:47:25.601 --> 00:47:27.350
but I promise I won't take long.

616
00:47:27.468 --> 00:47:28.518
Ok, fine.

617
00:47:28.949 --> 00:47:31.380
Back in your office, you
mentioned something about...

618
00:47:31.581 --> 00:47:33.127
talking to the sheriff tomorrow?

619
00:47:33.627 --> 00:47:34.725
That's right.

620
00:47:35.026 --> 00:47:37.016
Yeah, the thing is..

621
00:47:37.474 --> 00:47:38.773
That can't happen.

622
00:47:39.074 --> 00:47:40.136

Not for me,

625
00:47:45.166 --> 00:47:45.999
not for my parents,

626
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:48.049
and it's really,

627
00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:50.290
really not good for you.

628
00:47:50.691 --> 00:47:51.814

629
00:47:55.775 --> 00:47:57.553
Brandon, listen to me, ok?

630
00:47:58.354 --> 00:48:00.045
I have to do my job.

631
00:48:00.155 --> 00:48:03.084
And to be honest, you showing up
at my house this late,

632
00:48:03.085 --> 00:48:06.023
it's very inappropriate, I'm gonna
need you to go home now, ok?

633
00:48:08.078 --> 00:48:09.097
Ok.

634
00:48:09.398 --> 00:48:10.404
I'll walk back.

635
00:48:13.242 --> 00:48:14.965

me with my homework.

No, what the fuck are you doing
in my closet wearing this creepy mask!

Hi Merilee. I know,
I'm leaving a lot of messages,

693
00:55:17.908 --> 00:55:20.889
it's just that it's after 10 now
and we still haven't seen him, so...

694
00:55:20.890 --> 00:55:22.293
Did she say anything to him at school?

695
00:55:22.436 --> 00:55:25.020
Maybe he said something
to you at school today or...

696
00:55:25.521 --> 00:55:26.677
If someone was gonna give
him a ride home or son..

697
00:55:26.715 --> 00:55:27.633
Shut up!

698
00:55:27.734 --> 00:55:29.936

to go after school I... I...

699
00:55:29.937 --> 00:55:31.837
I... I'm obviously rambling because I'm...

700
00:55:32.238 --> 00:55:34.796

please call me back, thank you.

702
00:55:37.367 --> 00:55:38.593

to your shirt?

706
00:55:48.341 --> 00:55:49.302

soccer this whole time?

00:55:51.569 --> 00:55:53.654
Well... after school,

709
00:55:53.955 --> 00:55:56.225
Royce and them asked me
if I wanted to play.

710
00:55:57.126 --> 00:55:58.957
And as soon as the game
started they wer...

711
00:55:59.498 --> 00:56:00.820
They were tripping me,

712
00:56:00.821 --> 00:56:01.975
and pushing me to the ground,

713
00:56:02.376 --> 00:56:03.276
and...

714
00:56:04.381 --> 00:56:06.909
they were all laughing
because my shirt got ripped.

715
00:56:07.787 --> 00:56:09.241
I just decided I'd walk all...

716
00:56:09.642 --> 00:56:10.601
all the way home.

717
00:56:11.602 --> 00:56:13.070

718
00:56:13.071 --> 00:56:13.859
Yes.

719
00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:17.010

tired, I'm gonna go to bed.

720
00:56:17.317 --> 00:56:18.538

No.

724
00:56:30.298 --> 00:56:31.989

725
00:56:35.657 --> 00:56:37.321
He's lying.
Yeah, obviously.

726
00:56:37.487 --> 00:56:39.311
I've told you if we don't do something
this is gonna get worst.

727
00:56:39.324 --> 00:56:40.835
What the fuck do we do?
I don't know.

728
00:56:41.004 --> 00:56:43.804
Maybe we need to talk to somebody
he needs a... like a specialist.

729
00:56:43.805 --> 00:56:44.508
What?

730
00:56:44.509 --> 00:56:45.749
And say what to him?
I don't know.

731
00:56:45.898 --> 00:56:49.833
Hello this is our son. We found him in a
fucking spaceship in the woods, now what?

732
00:56:49.968 --> 00:56:52.691
No we should've done something
a long time ago, this is on us.

733
00:57:01.689 --> 00:57:04.538
<i>Maybe this time we get lucky,
like a baby?</i>

734
00:57:19.582 --> 00:57:21.201
<i>Just shut up and kiss me.</i>

735
00:57:35.014 --> 00:57:37.014
<i>There's, like, a light in the woods.</i>

736
00:57:37.415 --> 00:57:38.415
<i>What?</i>

737
00:57:41.888 --> 00:57:42.888
<i>Tori?</i>

738
00:57:45.384 --> 00:57:46.384
<i>Tori.</i>

739
00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:01.770
<i>Tori.</i>

740
00:58:10.254 --> 00:58:11.254
<i>Tori?</i>

741
00:58:17.075 --> 00:58:17.596
<i>Hey Baby.</i>

742
00:58:19.197 --> 00:58:20.399
<i>What are you doing?</i>

743
00:58:27.909 --> 00:58:28.982
<i>It's a boy.</i>

744
00:58:39.034 --> 00:58:40.905
<i>Oh we tried for so long,</i>

745
00:58:41.206 --> 00:58:42.755
<i>to have a baby and he's here.</i>

746
00:58:46.994 --> 00:58:48.068
<i>He's here.</i>

747
00:58:48.469 --> 00:58:49.800
<i>Our gift.</i>

748
00:59:11.697 --> 00:59:12.697
Hello?

749
00:59:14.098 --> 00:59:15.098
Hey. Hey.

750
00:59:19.051 --> 00:59:20.051
Meri.

751
00:59:27.774 --> 00:59:29.413
They won't, they won't let me
see him, he has his..

752
00:59:30.214 --> 00:59:31.717
They said that his face,

753
00:59:31.918 --> 00:59:33.018
is too mangled.

754
00:59:33.946 --> 00:59:35.457
Did they know what happened?

755
00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:38.182
They. They found him on route 18,

756
00:59:38.183 --> 00:59:40.927
they think that he swerved
to not hit a deer and..

757
00:59:41.444 --> 00:59:44.350
And they. they are doing the
toxicology to make sure

758
00:59:44.351 --> 00:59:46.392
that he wasn't drinking.
Was he drinking?

759
00:59:47.288 --> 00:59:50.110
No, he just had like two
or three drinks of...

760
00:59:50.111 --> 00:59:51.316
I wasn't counting.

761
00:59:53.728 --> 00:59:54.979
How's Brandon?

762
00:59:55.350 --> 00:59:57.191
He is ok, we didn't tell him anything.

763
00:59:57.319 --> 00:59:58.808
No but did he get home ok?

764
00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:02.371
Yes he did.
Ok, thank God, thank God.

765
01:00:02.503 --> 01:00:05.520
He came over and I still
remember when he left,

766
01:00:05.521 --> 01:00:07.099
so I'm just glad that he is ok.

767
01:00:08.645 --> 01:00:09.853
He left you?

768
01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:24.265
Morning baby.

769
01:00:31.876 --> 01:00:34.439
Listen, there is something that
we need to discuss with you.

770
01:00:35.068 --> 01:00:37.495
And it's probably gonna be
hard to hear.

771
01:00:39.597 --> 01:00:41.281
Last night, your uncle Noah.

772
01:00:45.882 --> 01:00:46.923
He died last night.

773
01:00:49.969 --> 01:00:50.769
Ok.

774
01:00:54.613 --> 01:00:56.336
Brandon do you understand?

775
01:00:57.537 --> 01:01:00.172
Your uncle Noah passed away.
He is gone.

776
01:01:04.255 --> 01:01:06.283
I feel like you want me
to cry or something.

777
01:01:06.665 --> 01:01:07.779
Do you wanna cry?

778
01:01:09.611 --> 01:01:10.603
Brandon,

779
01:01:10.604 --> 01:01:12.748
we know that you were
at Merilee's last night.

780
01:01:16.825 --> 01:01:17.827
Honey,

781
01:01:18.228 --> 01:01:19.290
I'm your mom,

782
01:01:19.291 --> 01:01:20.987
I will always defend you.

783
01:01:21.458 --> 01:01:25.845
But if you know something about what
happened to Noah, you need to tell us.

784
01:01:32.924 --> 01:01:34.472
I don't know what happened to him,

785
01:01:35.133 --> 01:01:37.404
but I would never hurt uncle Noah,

786
01:01:38.105 --> 01:01:39.192
I love him.

787
01:01:40.435 --> 01:01:42.208
That is bullshit, he is fucking lying!

788
01:01:42.932 --> 01:01:45.029
Kyle.
Look we know you were there.

789
01:01:45.448 --> 01:01:47.119
What else are you lying to us about?

790
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:48.378
Can you calm down?

791
01:01:48.391 --> 01:01:50.683
Were you in Caitlyn's bedroom?
He was camping with us.

792
01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:52.739
Where were you Wednesday night
when Caitlyn's mom went missing?

793
01:01:52.752 --> 01:01:55.003
This is not helping.
He's lying to our fucking faces.

794
01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:57.131
I'm gonna go upstairs.

795
01:01:57.132 --> 01:01:57.720
You...

796
01:01:57.921 --> 01:01:59.800
No you are not.
You are not going anywhere,

797
01:01:59.801 --> 01:02:00.916
until we get all this on the table.

798
01:02:00.929 --> 01:02:02.888
Kyle, I will handle it!
Right now, right now. Right now!

799
01:02:03.015 --> 01:02:04.052
Did you hurt Noah?

800
01:02:04.153 --> 01:02:05.186
What did you do to him?

801
01:02:05.187 --> 01:02:06.724
He was my friend,
and you just fucking...

802
01:02:06.835 --> 01:02:08.000
Leave me alone!

803
01:02:14.899 --> 01:02:15.899
Brandon.

804
01:02:19.776 --> 01:02:21.236
You need to go to your room.

805
01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:22.487
Just go to your room.

806
01:02:23.377 --> 01:02:24.388
Are you alright?

807
01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:28.630
Honey?

808
01:02:29.336 --> 01:02:31.336
He's hiding that fucking
shirt for some reason.

809
01:02:32.093 --> 01:02:33.093
Honey.

810
01:03:11.285 --> 01:03:12.285
Shit.

811
01:03:18.221 --> 01:03:19.221
Dad?

812
01:03:21.575 --> 01:03:22.261
Hey Bud.

813
01:03:24.362 --> 01:03:26.033
I wanted to apologize.

814
01:03:28.743 --> 01:03:30.723
We've been going through
a lot lately and...

815
01:03:32.424 --> 01:03:35.048
I shouldn't have said what I said
to you.

816
01:03:36.533 --> 01:03:37.333
Ok.

817
01:03:39.453 --> 01:03:40.455
Come here.
What?

818
01:03:40.756 --> 01:03:41.402
What?

819
01:03:43.846 --> 01:03:44.780
It's right there.

820
01:03:45.081 --> 01:03:46.544
That could be anything.
No, no, no, no.

821
01:03:46.545 --> 01:03:48.136
That is why he was hiding
this from us last night.

822
01:03:48.137 --> 01:03:49.509
That is Noah's blood.

823
01:03:50.149 --> 01:03:51.149
How?

824
01:03:51.433 --> 01:03:55.178
How could Brandon have killed Noah
and then made it look like a car accident.

825
01:03:55.282 --> 01:03:56.548
Who knows what kind of
weird shit he could do.

826
01:03:56.549 --> 01:03:58.421
Noah was drunk,

827
01:03:58.624 --> 01:04:00.252
and wrecked the car,

828
01:04:00.653 --> 01:04:03.268
because you let him drive.
No, no, no, that is not...

829
01:04:03.269 --> 01:04:07.213
And now you are trying to take out
your guilt on our 12 years old son.

830
01:04:07.214 --> 01:04:07.452
Babe.

831
01:04:07.453 --> 01:04:10.828
You are making a hard situation,

832
01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:12.035
impossible.

833
01:04:12.062 --> 01:04:14.363
Babe, we've got to do something.

834
01:04:14.792 --> 01:04:17.360
If we don't more people are gonna
get hurt or people will die.

835
01:04:17.461 --> 01:04:18.989
You got to be with me on this.

836
01:04:19.407 --> 01:04:21.801
I will never turn against our son.

837
01:04:21.918 --> 01:04:23.217
He is not our son!

838
01:04:23.518 --> 01:04:25.599
He is some thing
we found in the woods.

839
01:04:25.865 --> 01:04:28.053
How fucking dare you say that to me?

840
01:04:28.741 --> 01:04:30.974
How dare you fucking say that to me!
Babe!

841
01:04:31.101 --> 01:04:31.801
Babe.

842
01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:33.334
Come on, he is killing us!

843
01:04:33.428 --> 01:04:35.877
<i>We now turn to more
sombre news tonight,</i>

844
01:04:35.878 --> 01:04:37.839
<i>as authorities are reaching
out to the public.</i>

845
01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.431
<i>For information in their search,</i>

846
01:04:39.432 --> 01:04:41.810
<i>for missing Darbo's waitress
Erica Connor.</i>

847
01:04:41.983 --> 01:04:44.833
<i>Who was last seen
at the iconic route 74 diner...</i>

848
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:48.632
<i>Anyone with information
about her whereabouts</i>

849
01:04:48.676 --> 01:04:50.713
<i>is strongly urged
to contact police officials.</i>

850
01:06:04.696 --> 01:06:05.771
Are you ok?

851
01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:15.404
Honey, I might take him...

852
01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:17.480
we take away this weekend,

853
01:06:18.681 --> 01:06:20.066
just the two of us.

854
01:06:21.921 --> 01:06:23.506
Take him out to Drive-wood,

855
01:06:24.107 --> 01:06:25.894
be his dad,

856
01:06:27.895 --> 01:06:29.314
let him know I love him.

857
01:06:48.450 --> 01:06:49.666
Here, don't forget these.

858
01:06:51.048 --> 01:06:52.562
Just wear them for me.

859
01:06:52.563 --> 01:06:53.282
Ok.

860
01:07:02.038 --> 01:07:03.972
You'll always be my baby boy.

861
01:07:07.477 --> 01:07:09.633
Oh my God you are getting so tall.

862
01:07:11.354 --> 01:07:12.954
Go have fun with your dad, ok?

863
01:07:15.217 --> 01:07:16.217
Alright.

864
01:07:19.265 --> 01:07:20.546
Seat-belt.
Alright.

865
01:07:24.506 --> 01:07:25.752
See you Sunday.

866
01:08:28.887 --> 01:08:30.996
Good afternoon Tori.
Hey.

867
01:08:33.541 --> 01:08:35.022
Your boy around by chance?

868
01:08:36.216 --> 01:08:38.060
Brandon went hunting with his dad.

869
01:08:38.534 --> 01:08:39.656
Is something wrong?

870
01:08:40.164 --> 01:08:42.602
Maybe you can answer
a question for me.

871
01:08:44.477 --> 01:08:46.143
Does this look familiar to you?

872
01:08:47.401 --> 01:08:52.778
Some kind of signature left at the spots
where both Erika went missing and Noad died.

873
01:08:53.077 --> 01:08:54.077
No.

874
01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:56.940
That doesn't look like a..

875
01:08:57.241 --> 01:08:59.717
BB, maybe?

876
01:08:59.718 --> 01:09:01.697
As in Brandon Breyer?

877
01:09:03.103 --> 01:09:04.369
I don't see it.

878
01:09:07.784 --> 01:09:09.474
Would you mind if I come in,
take a look around?

879
01:09:09.487 --> 01:09:12.522
I do mind, I think actually
you should go.

880
01:09:13.513 --> 01:09:14.668
Alright,

881
01:09:16.769 --> 01:09:18.289
but you know, I'll be back.

882
01:09:37.447 --> 01:09:38.627
These are deer tracks.

883
01:09:54.873 --> 01:09:56.778
Looks like there is more
than one set of tracks.

884
01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:12.682
Brandon?

885
01:11:14.118 --> 01:11:15.178
Oh man.

886
01:11:38.579 --> 01:11:39.379
What are you doing?

887
01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:42.880
Fuck.

888
01:11:45.181 --> 01:11:45.981
No.

889
01:11:46.856 --> 01:11:47.456
Please, stop.

890
01:11:48.024 --> 01:11:48.624
Please.

891
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:49.600
Please.

892
01:11:50.612 --> 01:11:51.412
God.

893
01:11:55.797 --> 01:11:56.819
Brandon, please!

894
01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:58.466
Stop. Stop don't hurt me ok?

895
01:11:58.467 --> 01:11:59.667
Brandon, please. please.

896
01:11:59.668 --> 01:12:00.468
Please.

897
01:12:00.893 --> 01:12:02.674
Brandon. Don't, don't. I'm sorry.

898
01:12:19.438 --> 01:12:20.571
Pick up, pick up!

899
01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:23.910
Kyle.

900
01:12:24.211 --> 01:12:25.559
Kyle I'm sorry, you were right,

901
01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.958
Baby you were right, he...
He killed Noah.

902
01:12:28.078 --> 01:12:29.679
He. Brandon.

903
01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:31.766
He did, he killed Noah.

904
01:12:32.367 --> 01:12:32.874
And...

905
01:12:35.675 --> 01:12:36.446
Kyle?

906
01:12:39.468 --> 01:12:40.268
<i>Mom.</i>

907
01:12:47.204 --> 01:12:48.521
Where's dad?

908
01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:51.831
<i>He is gone.</i>

909
01:12:53.871 --> 01:12:55.021
Gone where?

910
01:12:58.019 --> 01:12:59.030
<i>You know.</i>

911
01:13:00.391 --> 01:13:01.246
No.

912
01:13:02.747 --> 01:13:05.632
No I don't.
I don't know where.

913
01:13:06.055 --> 01:13:08.197
Where are you?

914
01:13:09.246 --> 01:13:10.579
I'm home mom.

915
01:13:26.157 --> 01:13:27.157
Brandon?

916
01:14:07.691 --> 01:14:09.471
Please pick up, please pick up.

917
01:14:13.899 --> 01:14:15.192
Please help me.

918
01:14:18.093 --> 01:14:18.993

921
01:14:46.334 --> 01:14:47.924
<i>Tori was screaming,
then the line went dead.</i>

922
01:14:48.015 --> 01:14:49.518
Shit. I'm on my way.

923
01:15:15.749 --> 01:15:16.769
What the fuck?

924
01:15:20.190 --> 01:15:21.190
Yeah.

925
01:15:28.808 --> 01:15:29.879
Tori!

926
01:15:30.476 --> 01:15:32.053
You got the sheriffs here.

927
01:15:32.554 --> 01:15:33.734
Where are you?

928
01:15:34.125 --> 01:15:35.690
Come to the sound of my voice, Tori.

929
01:15:38.275 --> 01:15:39.613
I'm. I'm here.

930
01:15:43.099 --> 01:15:44.900
Jesus Christ, what the fuck was that?

931
01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:47.300
Tori!

932
01:15:48.134 --> 01:15:49.145
I'm here.

933
01:15:49.815 --> 01:15:51.343
You are safe now, we got you.
No, no, no, no, no, you need...

934
01:15:53.995 --> 01:15:55.624
Go! Take cover!

935
01:15:55.677 --> 01:15:58.204
No you don't understand.
Go! Hide! Hide!

936
01:16:05.992 --> 01:16:07.300
Requesting backup,

937
01:16:07.501 --> 01:16:08.824

938
01:16:08.925 --> 01:16:10.113
Immediate help!

939
01:16:10.397 --> 01:16:13.157
We have a 217 in progress at route 9.

940
01:16:13.588 --> 01:16:14.761
Requesting backup.

941
01:16:14.981 --> 01:16:16.202
I repeat.

942
01:16:16.503 --> 01:16:17.619
I need backup!

943
01:16:17.986 --> 01:16:18.739
<i>Come in.</i>

944
01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.236
<i>Come in.</i>
I repeat.

945
01:16:21.337 --> 01:16:24.512
I have a 217 in progress
at the Breyer residence,

946
01:16:24.513 --> 01:16:26.413
I need backup immediately!

947
01:16:28.313 --> 01:16:29.213
<i>Officer?</i>

948
01:16:59.055 --> 01:17:00.656
If anyone can read me,

949
01:17:00.657 --> 01:17:02.159
I have eyes on the suspect.
He's outside.

950
01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:22.760
<i>Officer? Officer Ayres, come in.</i>

951
01:17:23.461 --> 01:17:25.061
<i>Come in, Officer Ayres.</i>

952
01:17:25.862 --> 01:17:26.662
<i>Hello?</i>

953
01:17:27.063 --> 01:17:28.263
<i>Did you hear me, come on?</i>

954
01:18:47.342 --> 01:18:48.968
The ship, it cut him.

955
01:18:49.269 --> 01:18:50.599
It cut him, it cut him.

956
01:19:42.021 --> 01:19:43.066
<i>Erica.</i>

957
01:19:58.694 --> 01:20:00.113
Brandon.

958
01:20:02.402 --> 01:20:03.751
Where are you baby?

959
01:20:06.015 --> 01:20:07.147
Brandon.

960
01:20:08.043 --> 01:20:09.340
Where are you baby?

961
01:20:13.798 --> 01:20:14.856
Brandon?

962
01:20:26.927 --> 01:20:28.313
Where are you baby?

963
01:20:33.998 --> 01:20:35.039
Brandon.

964
01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:00.951
Mom?

965
01:21:02.898 --> 01:21:03.998
Brandon.

966
01:21:05.128 --> 01:21:06.316
Listen to me.

967
01:21:07.448 --> 01:21:10.784
I have never stopped loving you.

968
01:21:11.348 --> 01:21:12.657
I believe,

969
01:21:13.158 --> 01:21:14.560
I still believe,

970
01:21:14.961 --> 01:21:17.199
you are a blessing,

971
01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:19.448
that fell to this earth.

972
01:21:32.601 --> 01:21:34.148
When we found you.

973
01:21:34.627 --> 01:21:37.396
You were so tiny and fragile,

974
01:21:37.397 --> 01:21:38.767
and all we could do was,

975
01:21:39.468 --> 01:21:41.045
keep you safe..

976
01:21:42.270 --> 01:21:43.815
Whatever you've done,

977
01:21:45.516 --> 01:21:50.470
I know there is good inside you.

978
01:21:53.541 --> 01:21:55.186
I wanna do good, mom.

979
01:21:56.012 --> 01:21:57.012
I do.

980
01:21:58.931 --> 01:22:00.161
And you will.

981
01:22:05.515 --> 01:22:08.706
You will always be...

982
01:22:13.561 --> 01:22:15.373
My baby boy.

983
01:22:23.992 --> 01:22:26.508
Oh Brandon, I'm sorry.
Oh Brandon.
