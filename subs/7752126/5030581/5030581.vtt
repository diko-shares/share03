1
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.876
Are you okay?
Mm-hmm.

2
00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:19.109
Oh, I like this.

3
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:20.846
Maybe this time
we get lucky

4
00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:23.682
and make a baby?
Let's just have some fun.

5
00:01:23.685 --> 00:01:25.115
Oh, I like fun.

6
00:01:25.117 --> 00:01:26.918
Just shut up and kiss me.

7
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.526
Ow!
Sorry.

8
00:01:33.527 --> 00:01:35.192
Hold on.

9
00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:36.864
It's this damn watch.

10
00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:41.769
Come on. Mm-hm.

11
00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:48.575
What's wrong?

12
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.046
You feel that?

13
00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.984
No

14
00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:02.453
Huh. It stopped.

15
00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:04.590
That's weird,
I didn't feel anything.

16
00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:07.058
Hold on!

17
00:02:07.061 --> 00:02:08.728
Babe, are you okay?

18
00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.597
Yeah. Okay.

19
00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:13.598
Okay, what the hell was that?

20
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.634
Oh, my God.

21
00:02:15.637 --> 00:02:18.469
Look out there.

22
00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:20.206
What is that?

23
00:02:21.643 --> 00:02:23.643
There he is.

24
00:02:23.645 --> 00:02:25.844
How's our little guy
this morning?

25
00:02:25.847 --> 00:02:29.146
Hello, how are you?

26
00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:32.182
Look at you!
Look, you're all sitting up!

27
00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:34.819
Oh, oh! Kick it!

28
00:02:41.663 --> 00:02:44.062
Look at that big smile!

29
00:02:44.064 --> 00:02:45.730
So happy!

30
00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:53.004
You're
crawling, look Kyle!

31
00:02:53.007 --> 00:02:55.305
Look at him crawl!

32
00:02:55.307 --> 00:02:57.009
Look at these overalls,

33
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.179
he's like a mini you.

34
00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.848
Look at you, putting your
little butt in the air.

35
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.686
Yeah, you're gonna work
on the farm like Daddy?

36
00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:08.556
Yes, just like a Breyer!

37
00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:17.096
Okay, I'm gonna turn this off,

38
00:03:17.098 --> 00:03:18.195
say "bye."
Bye.

39
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.515
Brandon?

40
00:03:43.191 --> 00:03:45.526
It's time to get ready
for school.

41
00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:52.365
Got ya!

42
00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:08.014
Not even close.

43
00:04:09.917 --> 00:04:12.349
I'm gonna find you.

44
00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:14.756
Better not be in that barn!

45
00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.547
You totally got me!

46
00:05:14.548 --> 00:05:17.084
You are getting
too big for this.

47
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.622
You'll always be
my baby boy.

48
00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:25.290
Okay, let's go.
Took you long enough

49
00:05:25.293 --> 00:05:26.292
to find me.

50
00:05:30.197 --> 00:05:31.831
Uh-oh.
Morning guys.

51
00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:33.798
What're ya doing in there?

52
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.432
I was just hiding.

53
00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:37.636
You know the rules of
the barn, right?

54
00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:39.971
Yeah, I mean
All the boards and nails

55
00:05:39.973 --> 00:05:42.507
and shit, don't want
you breaking your neck.

56
00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.677
He was only in there
for, like, two minutes.

57
00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:46.978
Uh-huh.
Did you eat breakfast?

58
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.848
Not yet.
Want some waffles?

59
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.850
Sounds good.
You're making waffles?

60
00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:52.750
Yeah.
What about some bacon?

61
00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:57.689
And that is what we call

62
00:05:57.692 --> 00:05:59.356
a hive.

63
00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:02.459
Wasps and bees,

64
00:06:02.461 --> 00:06:04.629
members of the same
insect family,

65
00:06:04.632 --> 00:06:06.463
both with two pairs
of wings,

66
00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:07.966
both with stingers.

67
00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:11.271
Can anyone tell me any
differences between them?

68
00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:18.012
Mr. Breyer?

69
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.814
Uh, well, um,
bees are pollinators,

70
00:06:22.817 --> 00:06:24.415
and wasps
are predators.

71
00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:27.052
Good, good. Anybody else?

72
00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:29.855
And wasps are more aggressive,
more dangerous.

73
00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:32.057
One species,
the Polistes sulcifer,

74
00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:34.026
is what's called
a brood parasite,

75
00:06:34.028 --> 00:06:36.262
they've lost the ability
to make nests,

76
00:06:36.264 --> 00:06:37.762
so they use brute force

77
00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:40.331
to make other wasp species
raise their young.

78
00:06:40.334 --> 00:06:42.867
And they make them feed
their babies things

79
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.670
like beetle larvae
and maggots.

80
00:06:44.672 --> 00:06:47.338
Bro, why are you always
talking about maggots?

81
00:06:47.341 --> 00:06:49.841
You must be one.

82
00:06:49.843 --> 00:06:51.242
Okay, alright.

83
00:06:51.245 --> 00:06:52.644
Don't worry,

84
00:06:52.646 --> 00:06:54.615
smart guys end up
ruling the planet.

85
00:07:19.206 --> 00:07:22.209
Beat me down again

86
00:07:23.944 --> 00:07:27.779
It started like a drum that

87
00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:31.685
Beat me down again

88
00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:29.870
Brandon?

89
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.311
Brandon?

90
00:09:50.591 --> 00:09:51.826
Brandon?

91
00:10:04.572 --> 00:10:05.605
Brandon?

92
00:10:30.931 --> 00:10:32.532
Brandon.

93
00:10:37.738 --> 00:10:39.104
Brandon?

94
00:10:42.143 --> 00:10:43.610
Brandon.

95
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.679
Brandon

96
00:10:50.417 --> 00:10:51.485
Brandon?

97
00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:55.921
Brandon.

98
00:10:55.923 --> 00:10:57.088
Hey.

99
00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:01.159
Hey! Shh, hey.

100
00:11:01.162 --> 00:11:03.629
Hey, it's me. It's mom.
Where Where am I?

101
00:11:03.631 --> 00:11:06.499
It's mom. Mom. Look at me.

102
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:11.068
You're all right. Shh, shh, shh.
You're all right.

103
00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:15.274
You were sleepwalking.
I think.

104
00:11:15.275 --> 00:11:20.111
Yeah it was
these voices or something.

105
00:11:20.114 --> 00:11:23.315
I know,
it'll be okay now.

106
00:11:23.317 --> 00:11:25.149
You're okay now.

107
00:11:25.152 --> 00:11:27.788
Where's it coming from?

108
00:11:31.759 --> 00:11:34.426
Please don't worry

109
00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:36.629
About a thing

110
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.398
Every little thing

111
00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:42.036
Will be all right

112
00:11:43.504 --> 00:11:46.337
No, don't worry

113
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.076
About a thing

114
00:11:50.678 --> 00:11:53.546
Every little thing

115
00:11:53.548 --> 00:11:57.683
Is gonna be all right

116
00:11:57.686 --> 00:12:00.751
No, don't worry

117
00:12:00.754 --> 00:12:03.523
About a thing

118
00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:13.866
Everything all right?

119
00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:17.235
Yeah, he was, uh

120
00:12:17.238 --> 00:12:19.504
sleepwalking,
I guess?

121
00:12:19.506 --> 00:12:21.008
Where?

122
00:12:22.644 --> 00:12:24.842
Nowhere. He was
just downstairs.

123
00:12:24.845 --> 00:12:25.946
He's fine.

124
00:12:27.181 --> 00:12:29.081
We should
go to bed, yeah?

125
00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:30.816
It's getting so late.

126
00:12:32.253 --> 00:12:34.553
Hold underneath.
Keep it stiff.

127
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.525
All right, I think
that's gonna hold it.

128
00:12:41.128 --> 00:12:43.163
Want one of these?
Sure.

129
00:12:45.298 --> 00:12:48.533
First couple of years
after we adopted you,

130
00:12:48.536 --> 00:12:51.235
I had no clue
how to be a dad.

131
00:12:51.238 --> 00:12:53.038
Your mom, she was
out one day,

132
00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:55.039
and you were
bawling your eyes out.

133
00:12:55.042 --> 00:12:56.774
But I had
a secret weapon.

134
00:12:56.777 --> 00:12:59.578
So you gave me
a piece of candy?

135
00:12:59.581 --> 00:13:01.481
Yep.

136
00:13:03.884 --> 00:13:05.817
Did it work?
I guess.

137
00:13:05.818 --> 00:13:07.653
You didn't turn
out that bad, did you?

138
00:13:07.655 --> 00:13:08.956
Huh?

139
00:13:10.658 --> 00:13:13.057
All right. Think you'll
be able to get the lawn?

140
00:13:13.059 --> 00:13:16.028
I gotta get to the seed store.
No worries. I'll handle it.

141
00:13:18.231 --> 00:13:20.134
Dang it.

142
00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:23.934
Come on.

143
00:13:27.975 --> 00:13:30.042
Stupid thing!

144
00:14:31.538 --> 00:14:34.438
You're not beating me.
I love it!

145
00:14:34.441 --> 00:14:36.441
You can't go
that close.

146
00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:39.644
What about this brown one?
I feel he's easy to pick up.

147
00:14:39.647 --> 00:14:42.815
You were right in front of it.

148
00:14:42.817 --> 00:14:44.616
This has to be it.
Oh! Come on!

149
00:14:47.388 --> 00:14:49.988
Make you happy

150
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:53.491
Happy birthday dear Brandon

151
00:14:53.494 --> 00:14:57.261
Happy birthday to you!

152
00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:01.232
There you go.

153
00:15:01.235 --> 00:15:02.668
This is for little kids.

154
00:15:02.669 --> 00:15:05.403
Come on, make a wish,
thank you, Erika.

155
00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:07.572
Didn't know
they were gonna bring it,

156
00:15:07.575 --> 00:15:10.274
If you don't want any,
just slide it over here.

157
00:15:14.749 --> 00:15:17.549
So Brandon, I hear
you're killing it in school.

158
00:15:17.552 --> 00:15:20.753
Tested in the top one percent.
No, he tested in the top

159
00:15:20.754 --> 00:15:22.320
one tenth of one percent.

160
00:15:22.322 --> 00:15:24.823
The whole faculty
is talking about him.

161
00:15:24.826 --> 00:15:26.893
He's our little super genius.

162
00:15:26.894 --> 00:15:28.693
So a special guy

163
00:15:28.696 --> 00:15:31.028
deserves a very special present.

164
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:36.033
This is from me
and your Aunt Merilee.

165
00:15:36.036 --> 00:15:38.102
Go ahead, open it.

166
00:15:38.105 --> 00:15:41.107
I shot my first buck
with that very same model.

167
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:45.745
Whoa, no, no, no.
No guns.

168
00:15:45.746 --> 00:15:47.846
We talked about this, Tori.
I know

169
00:15:47.849 --> 00:15:49.715
Come on, he's still
just a kid.

170
00:15:49.716 --> 00:15:51.048
I'm 12 years old.

171
00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:53.153
I know, exactly,
you're still a child.

172
00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:55.754
Give it to me.

173
00:15:55.756 --> 00:15:58.088
I'm sorry, what did
you just say to me?

174
00:15:58.091 --> 00:16:00.528
I said, "give it to me."

175
00:16:01.763 --> 00:16:02.761
Brandon.

176
00:16:02.764 --> 00:16:04.395
Okay, we're done here.

177
00:16:04.398 --> 00:16:07.600
We're not having ice cream.
Thank you. Let's go.

178
00:16:07.601 --> 00:16:09.501
Brandon, let's go.
Brandon!

179
00:16:09.504 --> 00:16:11.235
Up now.

180
00:16:11.238 --> 00:16:12.971
Brandon

181
00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.307
Listen to your father.

182
00:16:16.109 --> 00:16:18.109
We are leaving,
let's go.

183
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:21.379
So fun, thank you so much.

184
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.315
Okay sorry.

185
00:16:23.317 --> 00:16:25.216
Don't worry about.
So sorry.

186
00:16:25.219 --> 00:16:27.451
Nope. Yep, bye.

187
00:16:27.453 --> 00:16:28.923
I love you guys!

188
00:16:30.825 --> 00:16:32.625
Babe, I told you.

189
00:16:32.626 --> 00:16:34.292
You sure you want kids?

190
00:16:34.293 --> 00:16:36.126
I just don't get
that kid.

191
00:16:36.129 --> 00:16:38.898
Turns 12, all of sudden
he gets a mouth on him.

192
00:16:38.899 --> 00:16:41.667
So strange,
it was so unlike him.

193
00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:44.971
I worry about him.

194
00:16:44.972 --> 00:16:47.304
Getting older,
changing.

195
00:16:47.307 --> 00:16:50.610
We were so much worse
when we were his age.

196
00:16:50.611 --> 00:16:54.312
You remember all the running
around we did, sneaking out.

197
00:16:54.313 --> 00:16:57.148
Fooling around in
my parents' basement.

198
00:16:57.149 --> 00:16:59.684
My parents knew
exactly what we were doing.

199
00:16:59.687 --> 00:17:02.855
They didn't give a shit,
they'd already written me off.

200
00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:04.055
Oh, babe.

201
00:17:04.057 --> 00:17:08.560
We can never
do that to Brandon.

202
00:17:08.563 --> 00:17:11.830
He needs to know
we give a shit.

203
00:17:11.833 --> 00:17:13.701
He will.

204
00:17:16.003 --> 00:17:18.538
Why don't we go
camping this weekend?

205
00:17:18.539 --> 00:17:21.205
Just the three of us,
go up to Drywood.

206
00:17:21.208 --> 00:17:23.375
We haven't done that in so long.
Mm-hm.

207
00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:26.679
You know what else we
haven't done in a while?

208
00:17:26.681 --> 00:17:29.515
I know what you're thinking,
A little bit more

209
00:17:29.517 --> 00:17:32.884
gone to church. We have
not gone to church in a while.

210
00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:36.354
That's not all
I was thinking about.

211
00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:38.390
We need to clean out
the closet,

212
00:17:38.392 --> 00:17:40.859
that's what you were thinking.
Nope, no.

213
00:17:40.862 --> 00:17:43.228
Okay,
but you gotta be quiet.

214
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:44.864
I will be,
I'm always quiet.

215
00:17:44.865 --> 00:17:46.798
He's not asleep yet.
Shh.

216
00:17:49.537 --> 00:17:51.570
Here.

217
00:17:51.573 --> 00:17:53.705
What's that,
three or four?

218
00:17:53.708 --> 00:17:55.440
We got three,
we're good.

219
00:17:55.442 --> 00:17:58.076
I'm good.
Go get the flashlight.

220
00:18:00.247 --> 00:18:02.212
This needs batteries.

221
00:18:02.214 --> 00:18:03.950
Brandon, it's gonna be cold.

222
00:18:03.951 --> 00:18:06.286
You're gonna need
your warm jacket, okay?

223
00:18:14.126 --> 00:18:16.361
Hey, did you hear
your mother, bud?

224
00:18:19.601 --> 00:18:20.801
Hey.

225
00:18:27.875 --> 00:18:28.907
Brandon.

226
00:18:52.733 --> 00:18:54.700
Hey, hon, um

227
00:18:54.701 --> 00:18:56.468
Look what I found.

228
00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:00.006
What is that?

229
00:19:00.008 --> 00:19:01.807
Is that the kid's
idea of porn?

230
00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:03.474
I think so.
Wow.

231
00:19:03.477 --> 00:19:05.076
Bra ads.

232
00:19:05.078 --> 00:19:07.946
Guess we knew
this day was coming.

233
00:19:07.949 --> 00:19:10.280
The hell is that?

234
00:19:10.282 --> 00:19:12.450
Is this like a guy thing?

235
00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:14.586
No, that's not
a guy thing I know.

236
00:19:14.588 --> 00:19:16.855
Ew.

237
00:19:16.857 --> 00:19:19.961
Maybe we should
have the talk with him.

238
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.605
Hey, Brandon.

239
00:19:32.606 --> 00:19:35.641
You know, you just
had your birthday.

240
00:19:35.643 --> 00:19:40.078
Which means that you
are becoming a young man.

241
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.846
Your body's changing.

242
00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:43.615
Okay.

243
00:19:43.617 --> 00:19:47.251
Well, you're going to
start developing, you know

244
00:19:47.253 --> 00:19:48.988
feelings about women,

245
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:50.990
women's bodies,

246
00:19:50.991 --> 00:19:53.826
I was just like you
when I was your age.

247
00:19:53.827 --> 00:19:58.064
And I also thought about
girls all the time, heh.

248
00:19:58.066 --> 00:20:01.398
You know, nobody was
around to tell me that

249
00:20:01.401 --> 00:20:04.135
it was okay to, uh

250
00:20:04.137 --> 00:20:06.907
touch it
or play with it.

251
00:20:08.576 --> 00:20:09.876
With what?

252
00:20:12.046 --> 00:20:14.015
Uh, you know,
with, uh

253
00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:16.718
Your penis.

254
00:20:19.286 --> 00:20:22.087
Okay.
Look, the thing about

255
00:20:22.089 --> 00:20:24.557
you know, sex,
it's not

256
00:20:24.558 --> 00:20:27.759
it's not about organs
or body parts,

257
00:20:27.761 --> 00:20:31.730
I mean, it is that too, but

258
00:20:31.732 --> 00:20:34.365
You know, it's about finding
the right person

259
00:20:34.366 --> 00:20:35.869
and falling in love.

260
00:20:37.739 --> 00:20:39.637
Look, all I'm saying is

261
00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.906
you're a guy, you know,

262
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:44.143
and you're gonna have
certain urges,

263
00:20:44.144 --> 00:20:46.846
you know, about girls
you see in films,

264
00:20:46.847 --> 00:20:49.582
or girls in class
or whatever.

265
00:20:49.584 --> 00:20:51.817
I'm just saying that it's okay

266
00:20:51.818 --> 00:20:54.586
to give in to them
now and again.

267
00:20:54.588 --> 00:20:56.386
Like, now?

268
00:20:56.388 --> 00:20:58.792
What?

269
00:21:00.359 --> 00:21:01.662
Like now?

270
00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:04.963
No, no, no.
Not

271
00:21:04.965 --> 00:21:07.067
not right now, no.

272
00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:11.469
Good talk.

273
00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:33.827
Brandon?

274
00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:57.282
If you know

275
00:21:57.285 --> 00:22:00.986
If you know someone

276
00:22:00.988 --> 00:22:04.990
Who's been looking

277
00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:08.160
For true love

278
00:22:08.162 --> 00:22:10.528
Send her to me

279
00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:15.099
Oh, yeah
Send her to me

280
00:22:15.102 --> 00:22:16.201
I'm

281
00:22:27.181 --> 00:22:30.715
If you've heard

282
00:22:30.718 --> 00:22:34.686
You've heard of someone

283
00:22:34.689 --> 00:22:38.289
Who's been crying

284
00:22:38.291 --> 00:22:41.491
Lonely tears

285
00:22:41.493 --> 00:22:43.796
Send her to me

286
00:22:43.798 --> 00:22:48.299
Oh, yeah
Send her to me

287
00:23:03.284 --> 00:23:04.451
Mom?

288
00:23:13.728 --> 00:23:16.595
What's wrong?

289
00:23:16.596 --> 00:23:18.365
Someone's there,
by the curtain.

290
00:23:41.355 --> 00:23:43.021
Honey, there's no one here.

291
00:23:43.023 --> 00:23:46.090
You have to believe me,
he was right there.

292
00:23:46.093 --> 00:23:48.394
Who was?

293
00:23:48.395 --> 00:23:50.895
Brandon Breyer.

294
00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:53.768
Brandon?

295
00:23:58.739 --> 00:23:59.973
Brandon?

296
00:24:01.675 --> 00:24:03.776
Brandon,
where are you, baby?

297
00:24:03.778 --> 00:24:05.576
Can you hear me?

298
00:24:05.578 --> 00:24:07.278
Brandon!

299
00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.915
Brandon.

300
00:24:12.153 --> 00:24:13.318
Oh, my God.

301
00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.054
Oh, my God, Brandon.

302
00:24:15.056 --> 00:24:17.088
Your father and I
were freaked out.

303
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:20.326
I didn't mean to,
I was just taking a pee.

304
00:24:28.269 --> 00:24:31.670
So you don't think I need
to take him to someone,

305
00:24:31.672 --> 00:24:34.940
like a specialist
For what?

306
00:24:34.942 --> 00:24:37.474
For talking back to his dad
and keeping

307
00:24:37.477 --> 00:24:40.112
weird jerk off material
under his mattress?

308
00:24:40.114 --> 00:24:42.413
It's more than that, Mer.
I don't know,

309
00:24:42.415 --> 00:24:44.950
he's always been
my little sweet guy,

310
00:24:44.951 --> 00:24:46.585
and now

311
00:24:46.586 --> 00:24:49.123
he's so different.
It's called puberty.

312
00:24:50.423 --> 00:24:52.090
I'm overreacting.

313
00:24:52.093 --> 00:24:54.393
A little bit.
Obviously, I am.

314
00:24:54.394 --> 00:24:56.095
I love you.
Thank you.

315
00:24:56.096 --> 00:24:58.531
I'll call you.
Okay, call me later.

316
00:25:06.007 --> 00:25:07.307
What's that?

317
00:25:09.109 --> 00:25:12.611
What? I wasn't snooping
or anything.

318
00:25:12.613 --> 00:25:14.880
It was nice line work.

319
00:25:14.882 --> 00:25:16.150
It was good shading.

320
00:25:46.947 --> 00:25:48.614
Fucking wolf.

321
00:26:00.493 --> 00:26:01.727
Brandon.

322
00:26:01.729 --> 00:26:03.327
Hey, what are
you doing, buddy?

323
00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.909
Buddy, it's 10:30
at night.

324
00:26:18.913 --> 00:26:20.548
Are you all right,
buddy?

325
00:26:27.288 --> 00:26:28.588
Think so.

326
00:26:32.192 --> 00:26:33.961
Come on, man,
let's get inside.

327
00:27:03.857 --> 00:27:05.124
Oh, my God.

328
00:27:05.125 --> 00:27:07.459
Tori. Tori!

329
00:27:07.461 --> 00:27:09.728
Tori, hey, wake up.
What is it?

330
00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:11.762
I need you
to come outside.

331
00:27:11.765 --> 00:27:14.167
You see? Right?
Oh, shit.

332
00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:20.972
So the wolf is back.
No, no, baby, I

333
00:27:20.974 --> 00:27:22.907
This isn't a wolf,
I mean

334
00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:24.643
This isn't
an animal. I think,

335
00:27:24.644 --> 00:27:27.278
I think this might
be Brandon.

336
00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.413
He was out here
earlier tonight,

337
00:27:29.415 --> 00:27:31.482
just staring at them.
The chickens

338
00:27:31.484 --> 00:27:33.354
They were all
fucking going crazy.

339
00:27:35.756 --> 00:27:37.655
Babe, a wolf can't do this!

340
00:27:37.657 --> 00:27:40.325
It can't rip a door off
and break a lock.

341
00:27:40.326 --> 00:27:43.028
But our 12 year old son can?

342
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:44.832
So you can't explain
it, either?

343
00:27:46.232 --> 00:27:48.967
Kyle, stop.
It was the wolf.

344
00:27:48.969 --> 00:27:51.470
I'm going to bed.

345
00:27:53.273 --> 00:27:55.642
This game is called
willows in the wind.

346
00:27:55.644 --> 00:27:57.342
It's about working
together,

347
00:27:57.344 --> 00:27:59.478
and building trust.
Lean back,

348
00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.013
and depend on your classmates.

349
00:28:02.016 --> 00:28:05.185
Whoa, come on now, focus!

350
00:28:07.153 --> 00:28:09.588
All right, very good guys.

351
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:10.989
When we trust
each other,

352
00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:12.691
good things happen.

353
00:28:12.692 --> 00:28:14.661
All right, you're up next,
big guy.

354
00:28:14.663 --> 00:28:16.295
Let's hear it for Brandon.
Loser.

355
00:28:16.297 --> 00:28:17.863
Nothing to be afraid of,

356
00:28:17.865 --> 00:28:19.767
your classmates
have your back.

357
00:28:26.575 --> 00:28:28.406
Good job.

358
00:28:28.409 --> 00:28:29.875
Ew!

359
00:28:29.876 --> 00:28:31.876
Oh, shit.

360
00:28:31.878 --> 00:28:33.579
Way to trust the floor.

361
00:28:33.582 --> 00:28:34.980
Hey, hey.
Knock it off.

362
00:28:34.981 --> 00:28:36.381
You okay, bud?

363
00:28:36.383 --> 00:28:38.384
Damn, Caitlyn,
give him a hand up.

364
00:28:40.153 --> 00:28:42.654
Hey, hold on,
we all on the same team here.

365
00:28:42.656 --> 00:28:44.823
He's a pervert.

366
00:28:44.825 --> 00:28:45.990
You lie.

367
00:28:45.992 --> 00:28:47.660
Idiot.
Caitlyn, help him up.

368
00:28:47.662 --> 00:28:49.329
or you fail this class.

369
00:28:59.574 --> 00:29:01.138
What are you doing?

370
00:29:01.141 --> 00:29:02.508
Brandon!

371
00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:04.175
Let go. Stop it!

372
00:29:04.178 --> 00:29:05.410
Brandon stop!

373
00:29:08.147 --> 00:29:10.382
Erika, he said he's sorry.

374
00:29:10.384 --> 00:29:12.585
It was an accident,
they're just kids.

375
00:29:12.586 --> 00:29:15.019
Did you see
my daughter's hand?

376
00:29:15.021 --> 00:29:17.154
He's a goddamn animal,
is what he is.

377
00:29:17.156 --> 00:29:19.191
Can we just calm down
here, please?

378
00:29:19.192 --> 00:29:20.626
I want him in handcuffs,

379
00:29:20.628 --> 00:29:22.760
I want him gone.
We're taking action.

380
00:29:22.762 --> 00:29:25.396
He's going to be suspended for
Suspended?

381
00:29:25.398 --> 00:29:28.734
Do you job, arrest him.
Sorry ma'am, not your call.

382
00:29:28.737 --> 00:29:31.303
After the suspension,
he'll be in sessions

383
00:29:31.305 --> 00:29:33.538
with our school counselor
Ms. Merilee.

384
00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.741
His aunt. Jesus fucking Christ.

385
00:29:35.743 --> 00:29:38.943
Right now, she's the only
Know what? Her son

386
00:29:38.945 --> 00:29:42.447
was inside my daughter's
bedroom last Saturday night.

387
00:29:42.449 --> 00:29:45.585
He was camping
with us 30 miles away.

388
00:29:50.023 --> 00:29:52.356
Do you even know
who his real mother is?

389
00:29:52.358 --> 00:29:54.893
I'm his real mother.
I meant whatever inbred

390
00:29:54.894 --> 00:29:57.128
psycho gave birth to him.
Hey.

391
00:29:57.131 --> 00:29:58.864
I know exactly
what you meant.

392
00:29:58.865 --> 00:30:01.232
But if trash talking
a 12 year old child,

393
00:30:01.234 --> 00:30:03.468
lets you sleep better
at night, Erika,

394
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:05.471
maybe you're the one
who needs help.

395
00:30:08.808 --> 00:30:10.875
Sorry about your daughter.

396
00:30:12.945 --> 00:30:14.682
Get up,
let's go.

397
00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:32.597
Shit like that,
breaking a girl's hand?

398
00:30:32.599 --> 00:30:34.266
Goddamn it.

399
00:30:34.268 --> 00:30:36.934
Dad would've
whooped my ass.

400
00:30:36.936 --> 00:30:40.872
Yeah, well, this isn't something
we can ass whoop away.

401
00:30:40.874 --> 00:30:42.273
I just

402
00:30:43.443 --> 00:30:45.376
I need to tell
you something.

403
00:30:45.378 --> 00:30:47.211
The other night when
I found him

404
00:30:47.213 --> 00:30:49.781
sleepwalking,
he wasn't downstairs,

405
00:30:49.784 --> 00:30:51.653
He was in the barn.

406
00:30:54.622 --> 00:30:56.253
Did he find it?

407
00:30:56.256 --> 00:30:58.825
No No.

408
00:30:58.826 --> 00:31:01.359
But he was tugging
at the trap door.

409
00:31:01.362 --> 00:31:03.628
How'd he even know
it's in there?

410
00:31:03.631 --> 00:31:05.463
I don't think he does.

411
00:31:05.465 --> 00:31:07.767
It was like he was drawn to it.
Babe.

412
00:31:07.769 --> 00:31:10.469
He may look like us,
and sound like us,

413
00:31:10.471 --> 00:31:12.104
but he's never bled,

414
00:31:12.105 --> 00:31:13.772
not once in his
whole life,

415
00:31:13.775 --> 00:31:15.374
he's never been cut,

416
00:31:15.375 --> 00:31:17.375
or broken a bone,
or had a bruise.

417
00:31:17.377 --> 00:31:19.046
And now he's
hurting people.

418
00:31:42.537 --> 00:31:46.373
Take. Take.

419
00:31:48.876 --> 00:31:51.711
"Yychhagaro" means "take".

420
00:32:58.311 --> 00:32:59.814
Brandon!

421
00:33:03.383 --> 00:33:04.751
Oh, God.

422
00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:20.732
Take larum

423
00:33:20.734 --> 00:33:22.969
Take the

424
00:33:22.971 --> 00:33:24.836
Oh, God, oh, God.

425
00:33:24.838 --> 00:33:26.471
Brandon!

426
00:33:26.472 --> 00:33:32.677
Take the

427
00:33:34.114 --> 00:33:36.848
Brandon!

428
00:33:36.851 --> 00:33:38.987
Oh, God.

429
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:44.223
Oh, Brandon.

430
00:33:48.127 --> 00:33:50.263
Baby, it's okay.

431
00:33:56.804 --> 00:33:57.939
Baby

432
00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:03.309
It cut me.

433
00:34:04.511 --> 00:34:05.944
Oh.

434
00:34:05.946 --> 00:34:09.215
Oh, uh, okay.

435
00:34:13.387 --> 00:34:14.653
You'll be okay.

436
00:34:14.655 --> 00:34:16.621
It'll be okay,
it'll be okay.

437
00:34:16.623 --> 00:34:18.289
It'll be okay.

438
00:34:18.291 --> 00:34:19.527
You're okay.

439
00:34:21.028 --> 00:34:22.329
Who am I?

440
00:34:32.507 --> 00:34:34.106
You're our son.

441
00:34:35.742 --> 00:34:38.409
What is this?

442
00:34:38.411 --> 00:34:39.880
Where did I come from?

443
00:34:41.682 --> 00:34:43.380
Listen, baby, I

444
00:34:43.382 --> 00:34:45.784
I know it's been
difficult for you lately,

445
00:34:45.786 --> 00:34:48.623
that you feel different
from other kids.

446
00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:52.222
You are different.

447
00:34:52.224 --> 00:34:55.226
After you dad and I
got married, we prayed

448
00:34:55.228 --> 00:34:58.362
and prayed for
a baby for so long,

449
00:34:58.364 --> 00:35:02.902
to God, to the universe,
to anyone that would listen.

450
00:35:02.903 --> 00:35:07.204
One night,
one perfect night,

451
00:35:07.206 --> 00:35:09.744
someone listened.

452
00:35:12.445 --> 00:35:15.347
We did not adopt you.

453
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:17.949
from an agency.

454
00:35:17.952 --> 00:35:19.918
You came here

455
00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.922
arrived here,

456
00:35:22.923 --> 00:35:23.891
in that.

457
00:35:27.126 --> 00:35:29.460
We found you in the woods.

458
00:35:29.463 --> 00:35:33.164
You were just a little guy,
all alone.

459
00:35:33.166 --> 00:35:35.432
You could barely breathe,
and so we

460
00:35:35.434 --> 00:35:37.434
We took you in.

461
00:35:37.436 --> 00:35:40.739
And you have been
a gift,

462
00:35:40.742 --> 00:35:42.807
my baby boy.

463
00:35:42.809 --> 00:35:46.646
I I can't even imagine
how overwhelmed

464
00:35:46.648 --> 00:35:48.413
you must feel
right now.

465
00:35:48.414 --> 00:35:52.150
But you have to know,
your dad and I believe

466
00:35:52.152 --> 00:35:54.619
that you came here
for a reason.

467
00:35:54.621 --> 00:35:56.320
That you are special.

468
00:35:56.322 --> 00:35:58.657
And that you're
going to do incredible

469
00:35:58.659 --> 00:36:00.157
You lied to me!

470
00:36:00.159 --> 00:36:02.193
We just wanted to take
care of you.

471
00:36:02.195 --> 00:36:05.563
And we always planned to tell
You lied to me! You lied!

472
00:36:05.565 --> 00:36:07.900
Wait.

473
00:36:07.902 --> 00:36:09.835
I hate you,

474
00:36:09.836 --> 00:36:12.302
you lied to me. You're liars!
You lied.

475
00:36:12.304 --> 00:36:14.572
I hate you! I hate this place.

476
00:36:14.574 --> 00:36:16.775
What is going on
in here?

477
00:36:16.777 --> 00:36:19.110
He He found it.

478
00:36:21.615 --> 00:36:23.148
He found it.

479
00:36:27.286 --> 00:36:31.856
Take the ghhol.

480
00:36:31.858 --> 00:36:33.458
Ghhol.

481
00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.695
Ghhol. Ghhol.

482
00:36:35.697 --> 00:36:38.264
Take the world.

483
00:36:40.967 --> 00:36:42.103
Take the world.

484
00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:05.389
Don't scream.

485
00:37:05.391 --> 00:37:07.391
What are you doing here?

486
00:37:07.393 --> 00:37:09.831
I brought you flowers.

487
00:37:11.231 --> 00:37:12.965
You can't be here.

488
00:37:14.333 --> 00:37:16.400
Don't be scared.

489
00:37:16.402 --> 00:37:18.039
I wanna talk to you.

490
00:37:20.208 --> 00:37:22.577
I want to tell you
what I learned tonight.

491
00:37:24.244 --> 00:37:25.978
I learned that

492
00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:28.179
I'm very

493
00:37:28.181 --> 00:37:29.851
special.

494
00:37:31.719 --> 00:37:34.485
You're one of the only
people in the world

495
00:37:34.487 --> 00:37:37.255
that knows how
special I am.

496
00:37:37.257 --> 00:37:39.625
But someday

497
00:37:39.626 --> 00:37:41.628
they will all know.

498
00:37:44.599 --> 00:37:48.867
My mom told
me not to talk to you.

499
00:37:48.869 --> 00:37:51.603
I'm gonna take care of that.

500
00:38:06.788 --> 00:38:08.887
Have good one, Gary.

501
00:39:04.778 --> 00:39:06.679
Hey, who's messing
with me?

502
00:39:10.284 --> 00:39:11.786
Is that you, Gary?

503
00:40:29.396 --> 00:40:30.929
Get out of here!

504
00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:39.438
Leave me alone!

505
00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:35.260
Is he awake?

506
00:41:35.262 --> 00:41:37.128
I called up two times
already,

507
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:38.731
I heard him
walking around.

508
00:41:38.733 --> 00:41:41.099
Should somebody go
get him, I mean

509
00:41:41.101 --> 00:41:43.101
Morning.

510
00:41:43.103 --> 00:41:44.902
Hey, bud.

511
00:41:44.905 --> 00:41:47.672
Uh, you know you're
going to be late for school.

512
00:41:47.675 --> 00:41:51.809
Yeah, I know, I was just
up in my room thinking.

513
00:41:51.811 --> 00:41:53.380
Thinking about what?

514
00:41:55.615 --> 00:41:57.181
Just about everything.

515
00:41:57.184 --> 00:42:00.153
And, uh,
it's totally cool.

516
00:42:02.556 --> 00:42:04.956
I feel good.

517
00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.460
I'm glad you
feel that way, buddy.

518
00:42:08.461 --> 00:42:09.628
Me too.

519
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:11.496
Why don't you grab
a seat?

520
00:42:11.498 --> 00:42:13.632
Ten minutes late never
killed anyone.

521
00:42:18.672 --> 00:42:23.275
You say she hasn't responded
to any calls or texts?

522
00:42:23.277 --> 00:42:25.277
That's correct.

523
00:42:25.278 --> 00:42:27.378
This was the last place
she was seen.

524
00:42:30.317 --> 00:42:32.550
Doesn't look like
a robbery.

525
00:42:42.496 --> 00:42:43.898
Good, God.

526
00:42:45.331 --> 00:42:48.132
Have you talked
to her daughter?

527
00:42:48.135 --> 00:42:50.601
She's a mess right now.

528
00:42:50.603 --> 00:42:52.771
Scared shitless.

529
00:42:52.773 --> 00:42:54.641
I barely got two words
out of her.

530
00:42:56.277 --> 00:42:57.545
What is that?

531
00:43:11.692 --> 00:43:14.358
So I know this
is kind of strange,

532
00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.929
I'm your aunt,
and I'm also your counselor,

533
00:43:16.931 --> 00:43:19.264
but I'm the only one
the district's got,

534
00:43:19.266 --> 00:43:20.768
so you are stuck with me.

535
00:43:22.036 --> 00:43:23.735
So Brandon,
your mom tells me

536
00:43:23.737 --> 00:43:26.170
that you've been having
some issues lately

537
00:43:26.172 --> 00:43:27.775
about being adopted.

538
00:43:29.376 --> 00:43:30.909
Nothing bad,

539
00:43:30.911 --> 00:43:32.244
only good ones.
Really?

540
00:43:32.246 --> 00:43:34.612
How so?

541
00:43:34.614 --> 00:43:36.849
I've realized I'm special.

542
00:43:36.851 --> 00:43:40.619
Because my real parents aren't
from a stupid place like here.

543
00:43:40.621 --> 00:43:44.188
You don't think of you mom
and dad as your real parents?

544
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:46.925
I do, but I just know
I'm something else.

545
00:43:46.927 --> 00:43:48.597
Something superior.

546
00:43:52.932 --> 00:43:54.233
Brandon,

547
00:43:54.235 --> 00:43:55.967
do you feel bad

548
00:43:55.969 --> 00:43:58.838
about what you did to Caitlyn?

549
00:44:01.307 --> 00:44:03.074
You know,

550
00:44:03.077 --> 00:44:04.742
sometimes

551
00:44:04.744 --> 00:44:06.777
when bad things
happen to people,

552
00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.516
it's for a good reason.

553
00:44:11.918 --> 00:44:14.318
Brandon,
part of my job

554
00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.887
is to update the school,

555
00:44:15.889 --> 00:44:18.190
and to update your mom
on your progress,

556
00:44:18.192 --> 00:44:20.692
and to let them know
if you are showing any

557
00:44:20.693 --> 00:44:22.460
growth or remorse,
and I

558
00:44:22.463 --> 00:44:27.268
I can't take it easy on you
because you're my family.

559
00:44:28.969 --> 00:44:31.603
I'm giving you an opportunity
to talk to me,

560
00:44:31.606 --> 00:44:34.139
I'm supposed to update
the sheriff tomorrow,

561
00:44:34.141 --> 00:44:36.275
and I have to be
honest with him.

562
00:44:48.355 --> 00:44:50.523
Yeah, my buddy said
the diner was just

563
00:44:50.525 --> 00:44:53.692
Was just wrecked.
And the waitress Erika

564
00:44:53.693 --> 00:44:55.360
was gone.
It's been 24 hours.

565
00:44:55.362 --> 00:44:58.197
Wow, Kyle, you think
your son could have done it?

566
00:44:59.199 --> 00:45:00.500
Dude!
What?

567
00:45:00.501 --> 00:45:02.300
He crushed
her daughter's hand.

568
00:45:02.302 --> 00:45:04.369
That's not funny
right now, okay?

569
00:45:04.371 --> 00:45:06.505
Okay, I'm sorry.
So, uh

570
00:45:06.507 --> 00:45:08.306
What's gonna happen
with all that?

571
00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:10.543
I don't know.
He got suspended for a few days,

572
00:45:10.545 --> 00:45:13.010
and I'm sure I'm gonna get
a call from some lawyer

573
00:45:13.012 --> 00:45:14.980
telling me my son's
a monster, which

574
00:45:14.981 --> 00:45:16.648
I don't even know anymore.
Maybe he is.

575
00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:18.750
They're all monsters.
I'm going home.

576
00:45:18.751 --> 00:45:20.552
Come on. One more.

577
00:45:20.554 --> 00:45:22.753
One more. Come on.
No, no. I gotta get home,

578
00:45:22.755 --> 00:45:24.489
or Merilee's gonna kill me.
I'll drive you.

579
00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:26.224
It's just a few miles
down the road.

580
00:45:26.226 --> 00:45:28.862
No, hang. I'll drive.
Mommy, I'm okay.

581
00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:32.365
Brandon!

582
00:45:35.536 --> 00:45:37.539
I'm home.
I got us sesame chicken.

583
00:45:41.007 --> 00:45:42.076
Brandon?

584
00:46:11.371 --> 00:46:12.306
What?

585
00:46:32.458 --> 00:46:34.994
Alert. Motion, backyard.

586
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:37.666
What?

587
00:46:59.586 --> 00:47:00.954
Who the hell?

588
00:47:17.706 --> 00:47:20.304
Hey.
Brandon, Jesus.

589
00:47:20.306 --> 00:47:22.206
What are you doing here?

590
00:47:22.208 --> 00:47:24.108
I need to talk to you.

591
00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:27.211
I know it's late,
but I promise I won't take long.

592
00:47:27.213 --> 00:47:28.847
Okay. Fine.

593
00:47:28.849 --> 00:47:31.016
Back in your office,
you mentioned something about

594
00:47:31.018 --> 00:47:33.018
talking to
the sheriff tomorrow?

595
00:47:33.019 --> 00:47:34.853
Mm-hmm.
That's right.

596
00:47:34.855 --> 00:47:37.155
Yeah, the thing is

597
00:47:37.157 --> 00:47:40.324
that can't happen, ever.

598
00:47:40.327 --> 00:47:43.195
It's just not good for anyone.

599
00:47:43.197 --> 00:47:46.431
Not for me,
not for my parents,

600
00:47:46.432 --> 00:47:50.302
and it's really,
really not good for you.

601
00:47:50.304 --> 00:47:51.905
At all.

602
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:58.275
Brandon,
listen to me, okay?

603
00:47:58.277 --> 00:47:59.878
I have to do my job.

604
00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.715
And to be honest, you showing up
at my house this late

605
00:48:02.717 --> 00:48:04.349
is very inappropriate.

606
00:48:04.351 --> 00:48:06.452
I'm gonna need you
to go home now, okay?

607
00:48:07.856 --> 00:48:09.253
Okay.

608
00:48:09.255 --> 00:48:10.692
I'll walk back.

609
00:48:13.092 --> 00:48:14.862
Okay, sweetie.
Be safe.

610
00:48:15.864 --> 00:48:17.030
You too.

611
00:48:26.239 --> 00:48:28.106
Alert. Motion, backyard.

612
00:48:28.108 --> 00:48:30.842
What the hell? Seriously?

613
00:48:30.844 --> 00:48:32.512
Alert.

614
00:48:32.514 --> 00:48:34.280
Motion, backyard.

615
00:48:38.018 --> 00:48:39.853
Brandon, is that you?

616
00:48:43.356 --> 00:48:45.757
This is so annoying.

617
00:48:47.393 --> 00:48:50.563
Alert. Alert. Alert.

618
00:48:50.565 --> 00:48:53.197
Motion, backyard.
Ugh, great.

619
00:48:53.199 --> 00:48:55.536
The whole freaking house
is falling apart.

620
00:50:49.048 --> 00:50:50.150
Oh, shit.

621
00:51:01.394 --> 00:51:03.996
Brandon? What the fuck
are you doing?

622
00:51:03.998 --> 00:51:06.197
Aunt Merilee was helping me
with my homework.

623
00:51:06.199 --> 00:51:07.567
No, what the fuck
are you doing in my closet

624
00:51:07.568 --> 00:51:09.400
wearing this creepy mask?
It's not creepy.

625
00:51:09.402 --> 00:51:11.773
You scared the shit out of me,
weirdo! I'm taking you home.

626
00:51:14.708 --> 00:51:17.208
This is fucking insane, man.
I didn't do anything.

627
00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:18.677
Are you gonna
tell my parents?

628
00:51:18.679 --> 00:51:20.246
You're lucky
if that's all I do!

629
00:51:22.884 --> 00:51:24.248
Get in the truck.

630
00:51:24.251 --> 00:51:25.820
You shouldn't tell my parents.

631
00:51:31.059 --> 00:51:32.893
Brandon, get in the truck!

632
00:51:52.179 --> 00:51:53.277
Shit.

633
00:52:01.688 --> 00:52:03.824
What the fuck!

634
00:52:21.809 --> 00:52:22.710
Holy sh

635
00:52:26.947 --> 00:52:27.980
What the?

636
00:52:30.851 --> 00:52:31.983
No. Come on, come on.

637
00:52:31.985 --> 00:52:33.485
No, no, no.

638
00:52:33.487 --> 00:52:34.820
Come on, come on, come on.

639
00:52:34.822 --> 00:52:36.521
Ah, man!

640
00:52:36.523 --> 00:52:38.356
Come on, not now!

641
00:52:38.358 --> 00:52:40.492
Just Come on!

642
00:52:40.494 --> 00:52:42.827
Come on, come on, come on!

643
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:44.396
Come on!

644
00:52:46.432 --> 00:52:48.298
Come on!

645
00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:49.601
Damn it.

646
00:52:49.603 --> 00:52:52.403
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on!

647
00:52:52.405 --> 00:52:54.172
Stupid piece of shit!

648
00:52:57.978 --> 00:53:00.112
Oh, shit. Okay.

649
00:53:00.114 --> 00:53:02.949
Okay, it's time to go.
Come on!

650
00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:07.452
Nope. Mm-mmm.

651
00:53:07.454 --> 00:53:09.822
No, no, no.

652
00:53:09.824 --> 00:53:11.690
Come on!

653
00:53:11.693 --> 00:53:13.893
Get out of here!
Gotta go!

654
00:53:13.894 --> 00:53:16.164
Let's go! Come on!

655
00:53:23.838 --> 00:53:25.137
Uh

656
00:53:25.139 --> 00:53:26.371
Okay.

657
00:53:26.373 --> 00:53:28.338
Um uh

658
00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:30.510
This is, uh, really bad.

659
00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:38.751
What the What the fuck!
No, stop, stop!

660
00:53:38.753 --> 00:53:40.820
Come on, put me down!
Hey, man, stop!

661
00:53:40.822 --> 00:53:44.057
Oh, shit! Oh, fuck.
No, no. Fuck, fuck, fuck!

662
00:53:45.793 --> 00:53:48.358
Oh, shit! Oh, God!

663
00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:49.829
Goddamn it!

664
00:53:49.831 --> 00:53:51.666
God! Fuck!

665
00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:18.150
Hi, Merilee. I know
I'm leaving a lot of messages.

666
00:55:18.152 --> 00:55:20.853
It's after 10 now, and we still
haven't seen him, so

667
00:55:20.855 --> 00:55:22.755
Did she say anything
to him at school?

668
00:55:22.757 --> 00:55:24.989
Maybe he said something
to you at school or

669
00:55:24.992 --> 00:55:27.592
Like he got a ride home or
Shut up!

670
00:55:27.594 --> 00:55:29.494
where he
to go after school.

671
00:55:29.496 --> 00:55:32.664
I'm rambling
because I'm freaking out,

672
00:55:32.666 --> 00:55:35.365
so just please call me back.
Thank you, honey.

673
00:55:35.367 --> 00:55:38.505
Would you please stop?
I didn't say anything.

674
00:55:40.775 --> 00:55:42.043
Oh, my God, baby!

675
00:55:43.277 --> 00:55:45.376
Where have you been?

676
00:55:45.378 --> 00:55:48.112
Where were you?
What happened to your shirt?

677
00:55:48.114 --> 00:55:49.648
I was playing soccer.

678
00:55:49.650 --> 00:55:51.851
You've been playing soccer
this whole time?

679
00:55:51.853 --> 00:55:53.818
Well, after school,

680
00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:56.655
Royce and them asked me
if I wanted to play.

681
00:55:56.657 --> 00:55:59.456
And as soon as
the game started, they were

682
00:55:59.458 --> 00:56:02.327
They were tripping me
and pushing me to the ground,

683
00:56:02.329 --> 00:56:05.597
and, you know,
they were all laughing

684
00:56:05.599 --> 00:56:07.498
because my shirt got ripped.

685
00:56:07.501 --> 00:56:10.434
I just decided I'd walk
all the way home.

686
00:56:10.436 --> 00:56:12.804
I know I should have called.

687
00:56:12.806 --> 00:56:14.639
Yes.
Actually, I'm

688
00:56:14.641 --> 00:56:16.775
I'm just really tired.
I'm gonna go to bed.

689
00:56:16.777 --> 00:56:18.443
Okay, well,
let me take this

690
00:56:18.445 --> 00:56:20.280
No. No.

691
00:56:21.581 --> 00:56:23.349
Don't worry about it.

692
00:56:23.351 --> 00:56:24.518
It's fine.

693
00:56:30.257 --> 00:56:32.260
I'll come up
in a couple minutes.

694
00:56:35.563 --> 00:56:37.096
He's lying.
Yeah, obviously.

695
00:56:37.097 --> 00:56:39.597
If we don't do something,
this is gonna get worse.

696
00:56:39.599 --> 00:56:40.932
What the fuck do we do?
I don't know.

697
00:56:40.934 --> 00:56:42.601
Maybe we need
to talk to somebody.

698
00:56:42.603 --> 00:56:44.168
He needs a specialist.
What?

699
00:56:44.170 --> 00:56:45.871
And say what to them?
I don't know.

700
00:56:45.873 --> 00:56:47.338
"Hello, this is our son.

701
00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:49.240
We found him in a fucking
spaceship in the woods.

702
00:56:49.242 --> 00:56:50.708
Now what?"
No, we should have

703
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:53.014
done something a long
time ago. This is on us.

704
00:57:01.889 --> 00:57:04.791
Maybe this time,
we get lucky and make a baby?

705
00:57:19.606 --> 00:57:21.206
Just shut up and kiss me.

706
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:37.389
There's, like,
a light in the woods.

707
00:57:37.391 --> 00:57:38.358
What the?

708
00:57:41.628 --> 00:57:42.963
Tori?

709
00:57:45.266 --> 00:57:46.634
Tori?

710
00:58:00.648 --> 00:58:01.949
Tori?

711
00:58:10.056 --> 00:58:11.324
Tori?

712
00:58:16.831 --> 00:58:17.764
Hey, baby.

713
00:58:19.132 --> 00:58:20.034
What are you doing?

714
00:58:27.675 --> 00:58:29.010
It's a boy.

715
00:58:38.853 --> 00:58:42.856
Oh, we've tried for so long
to have a baby, and he's here.

716
00:58:46.893 --> 00:58:49.597
He's here. A gift.

717
00:59:11.452 --> 00:59:13.284
Hello?

718
00:59:13.286 --> 00:59:15.088
Oh, God.
Hey, hey. Huh?

719
00:59:18.858 --> 00:59:20.061
Mer.

720
00:59:26.032 --> 00:59:27.565
You all right?

721
00:59:27.568 --> 00:59:29.835
No. They won't let me see him
because his

722
00:59:29.836 --> 00:59:33.539
They said that his face
is too mangled.

723
00:59:33.541 --> 00:59:35.840
Do they know what happened?

724
00:59:35.842 --> 00:59:38.443
They were
They found him on Route 18.

725
00:59:38.445 --> 00:59:41.447
They think that he swerved
to not hit a deer, and

726
00:59:41.449 --> 00:59:43.516
They're doing
the toxicology

727
00:59:43.518 --> 00:59:45.349
to make sure
that he wasn't drinking.

728
00:59:45.351 --> 00:59:46.851
Was he drinking?

729
00:59:46.853 --> 00:59:49.922
No, he just had
like two or three drinks of

730
00:59:49.923 --> 00:59:51.324
I mean,
I wasn't counting.

731
00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:55.360
How's Brandon?

732
00:59:55.362 --> 00:59:57.295
He's okay.
We didn't tell him anything.

733
00:59:57.297 --> 00:59:59.030
No, but did
he get home okay?

734
00:59:59.032 --> 01:00:00.766
Yes, he did.
Okay.

735
01:00:00.768 --> 01:00:02.233
Thank God. Thank God.

736
01:00:02.235 --> 01:00:05.336
He came over and I didn't
remember when he left,

737
01:00:05.338 --> 01:00:07.141
so I'm just glad
that he's okay.

738
01:00:08.442 --> 01:00:09.876
He left you?

739
01:00:22.956 --> 01:00:24.224
Morning, baby.

740
01:00:29.163 --> 01:00:30.228
Um

741
01:00:31.831 --> 01:00:34.333
There's something that
we need to discuss with you,

742
01:00:34.335 --> 01:00:37.539
and it's probably
gonna be hard to hear.

743
01:00:39.405 --> 01:00:41.639
Last night,
your Uncle Noah

744
01:00:45.746 --> 01:00:47.280
He died last night.

745
01:00:49.849 --> 01:00:50.818
Okay.

746
01:00:54.655 --> 01:00:56.688
Brandon,
do you understand?

747
01:00:56.690 --> 01:01:00.293
Your Uncle Noah passed away.
He's gone.

748
01:01:04.398 --> 01:01:06.565
I feel like you want me to cry
or something.

749
01:01:06.568 --> 01:01:09.168
Do you wanna cry?

750
01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:12.641
Brandon, we know you were
at Aunt Merilee's last night.

751
01:01:16.809 --> 01:01:19.244
Honey, I'm your mom.

752
01:01:19.246 --> 01:01:21.280
I will always defend you.

753
01:01:21.282 --> 01:01:24.483
But if you know something
about what happened to Noah,

754
01:01:24.485 --> 01:01:25.853
you need to tell us.

755
01:01:32.793 --> 01:01:34.992
I don't know
what happened to him.

756
01:01:34.994 --> 01:01:37.530
But I would never
hurt Uncle Noah.

757
01:01:37.532 --> 01:01:38.898
I love him.

758
01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:42.733
That is bullshit.
He is fucking lying!

759
01:01:42.735 --> 01:01:43.835
Kyle.

760
01:01:43.836 --> 01:01:45.369
Look, we know you were there.

761
01:01:45.371 --> 01:01:47.005
What else are you
lying to us about?

762
01:01:47.007 --> 01:01:48.706
Can you calm down?

763
01:01:48.708 --> 01:01:50.643
Were you in Caitlyn's bedroom?
He was camping with us.

764
01:01:50.644 --> 01:01:52.878
Where were you Wednesday
when Caitlyn's mom went missing?

765
01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.246
This is not helping!
He is lying to our faces!

766
01:01:55.248 --> 01:01:57.684
I'm gonna go upstairs.
You're what

767
01:01:57.686 --> 01:01:59.818
No, you're not.
You are not going anywhere

768
01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:01.219
until we get all this
on the table.

769
01:02:01.222 --> 01:02:02.954
Kyle, I will handle it!
No, no, no.

770
01:02:02.956 --> 01:02:04.289
Did you hurt Noah?

771
01:02:04.291 --> 01:02:05.489
What did you do to him!

772
01:02:05.492 --> 01:02:07.025
He was my friend,
and you just

773
01:02:07.027 --> 01:02:08.159
Leave me alone!

774
01:02:14.735 --> 01:02:16.036
Brandon.

775
01:02:19.574 --> 01:02:21.541
You need to go to your room.

776
01:02:21.543 --> 01:02:23.141
Just go to your room.

777
01:02:23.143 --> 01:02:24.512
Are you all right?

778
01:02:27.481 --> 01:02:29.047
Honey?

779
01:02:29.048 --> 01:02:31.182
He's hiding that shirt
for some reason.

780
01:02:31.184 --> 01:02:32.751
Honey.

781
01:03:11.224 --> 01:03:12.326
Shit.

782
01:03:18.132 --> 01:03:19.266
Dad?

783
01:03:21.402 --> 01:03:22.603
Hey, bud.

784
01:03:24.471 --> 01:03:26.239
I wanted to apologize.

785
01:03:28.809 --> 01:03:31.077
We've been going through
a lot lately, and

786
01:03:32.614 --> 01:03:35.014
I shouldn't have said
what I said to you.

787
01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:37.284
Okay.

788
01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:40.954
Come here, get in here.
What? What?

789
01:03:43.791 --> 01:03:45.824
It's right there.
That could be anything.

790
01:03:45.826 --> 01:03:48.460
No. That is why he was hiding
this from us last night.

791
01:03:48.461 --> 01:03:51.128
That is Noah's blood.
How?

792
01:03:51.130 --> 01:03:53.632
How could Brandon
have killed Noah

793
01:03:53.635 --> 01:03:55.333
and then made it look
like a car accident?

794
01:03:55.335 --> 01:03:56.934
Who knows what kind
of weird shit he could do?

795
01:03:56.936 --> 01:04:00.271
Noah was drunk
and wrecked the car

796
01:04:00.273 --> 01:04:02.708
because you let him drive.
No, that is not what

797
01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:05.277
And now you are trying
to take out your guilt

798
01:04:05.278 --> 01:04:07.346
on our 12 year old son.
Babe

799
01:04:07.347 --> 01:04:12.284
You are making
a hard situation impossible.

800
01:04:12.286 --> 01:04:14.085
Babe, we've got
to do something.

801
01:04:14.088 --> 01:04:16.320
If we don't, more people
are gonna get hurt.

802
01:04:16.322 --> 01:04:19.257
More people will die.
You gotta be with me on this.

803
01:04:19.259 --> 01:04:21.693
I will never
turn against our son.

804
01:04:21.695 --> 01:04:23.195
He's not our son!

805
01:04:23.197 --> 01:04:25.630
He is some thing
we found in the woods.

806
01:04:25.632 --> 01:04:28.166
How fucking dare
you say that to me.

807
01:04:28.168 --> 01:04:29.802
How dare you.
Babe!

808
01:04:29.804 --> 01:04:31.168
How can you
fucking say that to me?

809
01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:33.438
Babe. Come on,
he's killing us.

810
01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:35.807
We now turn to
more somber news tonight

811
01:04:35.809 --> 01:04:38.811
as authorities are reaching out
to the public for information

812
01:04:38.813 --> 01:04:41.980
in their search for missing
Darbo's waitress, Erika Connor,

813
01:04:41.981 --> 01:04:46.418
who was last seen at the iconic
Route 74 diner Wednesday.

814
01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:48.688
Anyone with information
about her whereabouts

815
01:04:48.690 --> 01:04:51.056
is strongly urged
to contact police officials

816
01:06:04.666 --> 01:06:05.666
You okay?

817
01:06:14.041 --> 01:06:15.574
I think I'm gonna take him

818
01:06:15.577 --> 01:06:18.210
I'm gonna take him away
this weekend.

819
01:06:18.211 --> 01:06:20.880
Just the two of us.

820
01:06:20.882 --> 01:06:23.782
Take him out to Drywood.

821
01:06:23.784 --> 01:06:25.786
Be his dad.

822
01:06:27.789 --> 01:06:29.824
Let him know I love him.

823
01:06:48.307 --> 01:06:50.175
Here, don't forget these.

824
01:06:50.177 --> 01:06:53.110
Just wear them for me.
Okay.

825
01:06:53.112 --> 01:06:54.548
Come here.

826
01:07:01.956 --> 01:07:03.824
You'll always be
my baby boy.

827
01:07:07.327 --> 01:07:09.664
Even though
you're getting so tall.

828
01:07:11.164 --> 01:07:12.666
Go have fun
with your dad, okay?

829
01:07:15.302 --> 01:07:16.335
All right.

830
01:07:18.873 --> 01:07:20.507
Seat belt.
Right.

831
01:07:24.177 --> 01:07:25.679
See you Sunday.

832
01:08:28.710 --> 01:08:30.175
Afternoon, Tori.

833
01:08:30.176 --> 01:08:31.144
Hey.

834
01:08:33.346 --> 01:08:34.916
Your boy around,
by chance?

835
01:08:36.216 --> 01:08:38.182
Brandon went hunting
with his dad.

836
01:08:38.185 --> 01:08:40.086
Hmm.
Is something wrong?

837
01:08:40.087 --> 01:08:42.556
Maybe you can answer
a question for me.

838
01:08:44.291 --> 01:08:45.893
This look familiar to you?

839
01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:49.828
Some kind of signature
left at the spots

840
01:08:49.831 --> 01:08:53.064
where both Erika
went missing and Noah died.

841
01:08:53.067 --> 01:08:54.101
No. Mm-mm.

842
01:08:55.469 --> 01:08:59.505
Doesn't that look
like a "BB," maybe,

843
01:08:59.506 --> 01:09:01.676
as in "Brandon Breyer"?

844
01:09:03.077 --> 01:09:04.176
I don't see it.

845
01:09:07.582 --> 01:09:09.814
Do you mind if I come in,
take a look around?

846
01:09:09.817 --> 01:09:12.351
I do mind. I think,
actually, you should go.

847
01:09:13.487 --> 01:09:14.788
All right.

848
01:09:16.591 --> 01:09:17.859
But you know I'll be back.

849
01:09:37.411 --> 01:09:38.680
These are deer tracks.

850
01:09:54.895 --> 01:09:57.164
Looks like there's more
than one set of tracks.

851
01:10:05.972 --> 01:10:07.337
No.

852
01:10:27.293 --> 01:10:29.029
Oh, God.

853
01:11:11.572 --> 01:11:12.606
Brandon?

854
01:11:14.207 --> 01:11:15.408
Oh, man.

855
01:11:41.868 --> 01:11:42.804
Oh, God.

856
01:11:44.971 --> 01:11:47.773
No. Please stop.

857
01:11:47.774 --> 01:11:49.109
Please. Please.

858
01:11:50.912 --> 01:11:52.012
God Ah!

859
01:11:55.682 --> 01:11:57.649
Brandon, please, stop, stop.

860
01:11:57.652 --> 01:12:00.350
Don't hurt me, okay?
Brandon, please, please.

861
01:12:00.353 --> 01:12:02.020
Please. Brandon, don't.
Don't.

862
01:12:02.023 --> 01:12:03.255
I'm sorry.

863
01:12:19.273 --> 01:12:20.340
Pick up, pick up.

864
01:12:22.710 --> 01:12:23.842
Kyle.

865
01:12:23.845 --> 01:12:25.578
Kyle, I'm sorry.
You were right.

866
01:12:25.579 --> 01:12:27.846
Baby, you were right.
He killed Noah.

867
01:12:27.849 --> 01:12:29.747
He Brandon

868
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:31.984
Brandon
He killed Noah.

869
01:12:31.985 --> 01:12:33.353
And

870
01:12:35.288 --> 01:12:36.690
Kyle?

871
01:12:39.292 --> 01:12:41.025
Mom.

872
01:12:41.028 --> 01:12:42.630
Brandon.

873
01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:48.502
Where's Dad?

874
01:12:50.805 --> 01:12:52.239
He's gone.

875
01:12:53.841 --> 01:12:55.475
Gone where?

876
01:12:57.845 --> 01:12:59.378
You know.

877
01:13:00.479 --> 01:13:02.347
No.

878
01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:05.850
No, I don't.
I don't know where.

879
01:13:05.853 --> 01:13:08.088
Where are you?

880
01:13:09.256 --> 01:13:11.225
I'm home, Mom.

881
01:13:26.106 --> 01:13:27.439
Brandon?

882
01:14:07.447 --> 01:14:09.247
Please pick up.
Please pick up.

883
01:14:13.887 --> 01:14:15.588
Please help me.

884
01:14:17.557 --> 01:14:18.658
Please

885
01:14:19.961 --> 01:14:21.159
911.

886
01:14:44.585 --> 01:14:46.585
Got a
call from the Breyer residence.

887
01:14:46.587 --> 01:14:48.453
Tori was screaming,
then the line went dead.

888
01:14:48.456 --> 01:14:49.621
Shit. I'm on my way.

889
01:15:15.649 --> 01:15:17.018
What the fuck?

890
01:15:19.987 --> 01:15:20.988
Yeah.

891
01:15:28.863 --> 01:15:31.863
Tori!
You got the sheriffs here.

892
01:15:31.865 --> 01:15:33.465
Where are you?

893
01:15:33.466 --> 01:15:35.802
Come to the sound
of my voice, Tori.

894
01:15:38.271 --> 01:15:39.604
I'm here, I'm here

895
01:15:43.144 --> 01:15:44.878
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck was that?

896
01:15:46.212 --> 01:15:47.212
Tori!

897
01:15:47.213 --> 01:15:49.014
I'm here!

898
01:15:49.015 --> 01:15:50.516
You're safe now.
No, no.

899
01:15:50.519 --> 01:15:51.817
We got
You need to get

900
01:15:53.686 --> 01:15:55.487
Go! Take cover!

901
01:15:55.488 --> 01:15:56.954
No, you don't understand
Go!

902
01:15:56.957 --> 01:15:58.856
Hide! Hide!
We need to get out.

903
01:15:58.859 --> 01:16:00.958
Oh, my God.

904
01:16:06.033 --> 01:16:08.833
Request for backup
at the Breyer residence.

905
01:16:08.836 --> 01:16:10.435
Immediate help.

906
01:16:10.438 --> 01:16:13.238
We have a 217 in progress
on Route 9.

907
01:16:13.239 --> 01:16:15.173
Requesting backup.

908
01:16:15.176 --> 01:16:17.842
I repeat, I need backup!

909
01:16:17.845 --> 01:16:20.945
Come in.

910
01:16:20.948 --> 01:16:23.015
Repeat,
I have a 217 in progress

911
01:16:23.016 --> 01:16:24.349
at the Breyer residence.

912
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:26.385
I need backup immediately!

913
01:16:28.288 --> 01:16:29.457
Officer?

914
01:16:59.019 --> 01:17:01.619
If anyone can read me,
I have eyes on the suspect.

915
01:17:01.622 --> 01:17:02.756
He's outside.

916
01:17:20.474 --> 01:17:22.240
Officer?

917
01:17:22.243 --> 01:17:23.841
Officer Ayres, come in.

918
01:17:23.844 --> 01:17:25.644
Come in, Officer Ayres.

919
01:17:25.645 --> 01:17:28.782
Hello?
Officer Ayres, please respond.

920
01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:48.292
The ship.

921
01:18:48.295 --> 01:18:50.599
It cut him.
It cut him, it cut him.

922
01:19:23.396 --> 01:19:24.331
Okay.

923
01:19:41.881 --> 01:19:43.117
Erika.

924
01:19:58.766 --> 01:20:00.100
Brandon?

925
01:20:02.269 --> 01:20:03.936
Where are you, baby?

926
01:20:05.972 --> 01:20:07.774
Brandon?

927
01:20:07.775 --> 01:20:09.543
Where are you, baby?

928
01:20:13.648 --> 01:20:14.748
Brandon?

929
01:20:26.993 --> 01:20:28.494
Where are you, baby?

930
01:20:33.833 --> 01:20:35.537
Brandon.

931
01:20:59.793 --> 01:21:00.694
Mom?

932
01:21:02.930 --> 01:21:04.064
Brandon.

933
01:21:04.997 --> 01:21:06.166
Listen to me.

934
01:21:07.601 --> 01:21:10.770
I have never
stopped loving you.

935
01:21:10.771 --> 01:21:12.704
I believe

936
01:21:12.707 --> 01:21:14.707
I still believe

937
01:21:14.708 --> 01:21:17.309
you were a blessing

938
01:21:17.310 --> 01:21:19.613
that fell to this Earth.

939
01:21:32.393 --> 01:21:34.458
When we found you,

940
01:21:34.461 --> 01:21:37.362
you were so tiny and fragile.

941
01:21:37.363 --> 01:21:41.233
And all we could do
was keep you safe.

942
01:21:41.234 --> 01:21:43.637
Whatever you've done,

943
01:21:45.707 --> 01:21:50.645
I know there is good
inside you.

944
01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:55.782
I want to do good, Mom.

945
01:21:55.783 --> 01:21:57.216
I do.

946
01:21:58.685 --> 01:22:00.118
And you will.

947
01:22:05.426 --> 01:22:09.194
You will always be

948
01:22:13.466 --> 01:22:15.670
my baby boy.

949
01:22:23.912 --> 01:22:26.546
Brandon, I'm sorry.
Oh, Brandon.

950
01:23:54.234 --> 01:23:56.333
Rescue one, we have rescue

951
01:23:59.974 --> 01:24:03.307
Breaking news at this hour.
A passenger jet has crashed

952
01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:05.578
in the small town
of Brightburn, Kansas.

953
01:24:05.579 --> 01:24:07.479
Details are still coming in,

954
01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:09.814
but there are believed
to be no survivors

955
01:24:09.817 --> 01:24:13.083
among the 268 passengers
onboard.

956
01:24:13.086 --> 01:24:15.020
Investigators
are not yet sure

957
01:24:15.023 --> 01:24:17.590
what caused the plane
to drop suddenly from the sky

958
01:24:17.591 --> 01:24:20.190
and crash into
this small family farm.

959
01:24:20.193 --> 01:24:23.228
Among the reported dead are
the residents of the farmhouse,

960
01:24:23.229 --> 01:24:24.863
Kyle and Tori Breyer.

961
01:24:24.865 --> 01:24:28.065
They are survived by
their 12 year old son, Brandon.

962
01:24:32.471 --> 01:24:35.640
I'm the bad guy

963
01:24:35.643 --> 01:24:37.341
You see that? What is that?

964
01:24:37.344 --> 01:24:39.279
I'm the bad guy

965
01:24:46.353 --> 01:24:49.689
Bad guy

966
01:24:54.061 --> 01:24:56.094
The mainstream media, as usual,

967
01:24:56.095 --> 01:24:58.863
tried to sell you all
a load of bullshit.

968
01:24:58.865 --> 01:25:01.432
I like when you get mad

969
01:25:04.037 --> 01:25:07.506
I guess I'm pretty glad
That you're alone

970
01:25:07.507 --> 01:25:09.542
I like when you get mad

971
01:25:09.543 --> 01:25:11.610
Just like that half man,
half sea creature

972
01:25:11.613 --> 01:25:14.244
capsizing fishing vessels
in the South China Sea!

973
01:25:14.247 --> 01:25:15.948
Like what we were talking
about last week,

974
01:25:15.949 --> 01:25:17.617
some kind of witch woman

975
01:25:17.618 --> 01:25:19.752
who chokes people out
with ropes and cords.

976
01:25:19.753 --> 01:25:22.420
They are all out there,

977
01:25:22.421 --> 01:25:24.456
they are all waiting,

978
01:25:24.457 --> 01:25:27.359
and they are all gonna eat
our fucking breakfast

979
01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:29.697
unless we get our shit together
and do something!

980
01:25:35.335 --> 01:25:38.438
Da, da-da-da
Da, da, da-da-da-da

981
01:25:45.779 --> 01:25:48.581
White shirt
Now red with blood

982
01:25:48.582 --> 01:25:50.515
No sleeping

983
01:25:50.518 --> 01:25:52.784
You're on your tippy toes

984
01:25:52.787 --> 01:25:56.320
Creeping
Around like no one knows

985
01:25:56.323 --> 01:25:59.792
Think you're so criminal

986
01:25:59.793 --> 01:26:03.427
Bruises on both my knees
For you

987
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:06.430
Don't say thank you
Oh, please

988
01:26:06.432 --> 01:26:10.502
I do what I want
When I'm wanting to

989
01:26:10.505 --> 01:26:13.506
My soul's so cynical

990
01:26:13.507 --> 01:26:16.876
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough, guy

991
01:26:16.877 --> 01:26:18.778
Just can't get enough, guy

992
01:26:18.779 --> 01:26:20.979
Just always so puff, guy

993
01:26:20.981 --> 01:26:23.815
I'm that bad side
Make your mama sad, side

994
01:26:23.818 --> 01:26:25.818
Make your girlfriend mad
Side

995
01:26:25.819 --> 01:26:27.987
Might seduce your dad, type

996
01:26:27.988 --> 01:26:30.489
I'm the bad guy

997
01:26:31.591 --> 01:26:32.859
Duh

998
01:26:38.765 --> 01:26:41.201
I'm the bad guy

999
01:26:46.006 --> 01:26:49.641
I like it
When you take control

1000
01:26:49.644 --> 01:26:54.212
Even if you know
That you don't own me

1001
01:26:54.213 --> 01:26:56.849
I'll let you play the rogue

1002
01:26:56.850 --> 01:26:59.485
I'll be your animal

1003
01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:02.020
My mommy

1004
01:27:02.023 --> 01:27:04.789
Likes to sing along
With me

1005
01:27:04.792 --> 01:27:07.492
But she won't
Sing this song

1006
01:27:07.493 --> 01:27:10.628
If she reads all the lyrics

1007
01:27:10.631 --> 01:27:13.798
She'll pity them
And I know

1008
01:27:13.801 --> 01:27:17.168
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough, guy

1009
01:27:17.171 --> 01:27:18.970
Just can't get enough, guy

1010
01:27:18.972 --> 01:27:21.207
Just always so puff, guy

1011
01:27:21.208 --> 01:27:24.375
I'm that bad side
Make your mama sad, side

1012
01:27:24.377 --> 01:27:26.078
Make your girlfriend mad
Side

1013
01:27:26.079 --> 01:27:28.345
Might seduce your dad, type

1014
01:27:28.347 --> 01:27:30.984
I'm the bad guy

1015
01:27:31.786 --> 01:27:32.787
Duh

1016
01:27:39.092 --> 01:27:41.729
I'm the bad guy

1017
01:27:46.067 --> 01:27:47.167
Duh

1018
01:27:52.105 --> 01:27:55.842
I'm only good at being bad

1019
01:27:57.409 --> 01:27:59.514
Bad

1020
01:28:10.992 --> 01:28:13.127
I like when you get mad

1021
01:28:15.095 --> 01:28:18.596
I guess I'm pretty glad
That you're alone

1022
01:28:18.599 --> 01:28:20.632
You said
She's scared of me?

1023
01:28:20.635 --> 01:28:22.466
I mean

1024
01:28:22.469 --> 01:28:24.936
I don't see what she see
But maybe it's 'cause

1025
01:28:24.939 --> 01:28:26.506
I'm wearing your cologne

1026
01:28:29.143 --> 01:28:31.212
I'm a bad guy

1027
01:28:36.751 --> 01:28:38.751
I'm, I'm a bad guy

1028
01:28:38.752 --> 01:28:40.787
Bad guy
