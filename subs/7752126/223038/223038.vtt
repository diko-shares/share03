Ma'am. Why is it you guys who carry guns
always sound like cowboys?

181
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:07,551
I don't concentrate on faces in my job.

182
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,886
But you listen to voices.

183
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,760
Do you think you could identify the voice?

184
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:18,095
Well, I'd say yes, if it were...
It was almost a whisper.

185
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,132

You, I imagine, study faces.

187
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:36,750

How'd you happen to be up there after hours?

189
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:48,128
We had an evacuation.
I'd left some things in the sound booth.

190
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:52,667
And there just happened to be some fellas
talking about an assassination

191
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:58,240
in a language that you and eight other people
understand, in a room full of microphones.

192
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,570
Do you think I'm making it up?

193
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,671
Why would I report a threat I didn't hear?

194
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,975
- People do.
- I don't.

195
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,744
- Some people like attention.
- I don't.

196
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:15,518
- You don't want Zuwanie here.
- I didn't make it up.

197
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:19,959
- How do you feel about him?
- I don't care for him.

198
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:23,190

- If he were gone.

199

- Same thing.
- No, it isn't.

200
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:30,206
If I interpreted "gone" as "dead", I'd be fired.
If they were the same, there'd be no UN.

201
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:33,707

- I don't play with words.

- You are.

203

reported it. It's not what I want.

threatened, if there was a threat.

330
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,270
It might be.

331
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:51,243
Tell me, do you have a brother?

332
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,689
I hope it's all right. I took this opportunity
to ask Miss Broome a few questions.

333
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:05,728
You're free to go.
Agent Scott will drive you back to the UN.

334
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:12,728
Would you drive Ms Broome
back to the UN, please? Thank you.

335
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:17,031
- Does this mean the test was?
- The test was inconclusive.

336
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:21,575
But I'd rather make the mistake
of believing her than the bigger one of not.

337
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:27,751
Next time you want to question an
American citizen here, you ask permission.

338
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,152
- Silvia.
- Don't worry, I'm not leaving any...

339
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:37,087
Did you do something naughty?
A couple of FBls were asking me about you.

340
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:43,099
If you often work later than everybody,
or bring things in after hours. Like that.

341
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:49,802
- What'd you tell them?
- I said, from a sound engineer's point of view,

342
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,167
you're perfect.

343
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:53,909
I need somebody on the guy with two names.

344
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:57,137
- Mo.
- It's one name twice. Kuman-Kuman.

345
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,542
You volunteering, or just correcting me?

346
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:02,150
- I'm from Brooklyn.
- You got him. You and?

347
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:06,857
- I was on him when he first came here.
- OK, you got him again.

348
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:09,355
I thought she had perfect pitch.

349
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:12,188
She says whispers
don't have a recognisable pitch.

350
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:15,193
NSA agrees. They say it's very difficult.

351
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,866
- They don't know that.
- They say they do.

352
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:21,799
No, not NSA. Whoever she heard.

353
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:25,706
Why not let them keep thinking she can ID it?

354
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:31,378
- What are you asking me to do, Jay?
- I don't want her to be harmed.

355
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:36,918
In fact, get a place, keep an eye on her.
We got three days. She's your only link.

356
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:39,019
Are we using her as bait?

357
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,759
Just make the calls.

358
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:47,954
I'm sending you an attachment.
Can you print front and back?

359
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,834
I've asked INS for a list of arrivals
in the last six months.

360
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:57,006
<i>Zimbabwe, Botswana, Matobo</i>.
<i>I'll do voice samples on everyone</i>.

361
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:01,837
So when she hears the voice again,
she can identify it.

362
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,015
- She said it was a whisper.
- Well, now she thinks she can do it.

363
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,943
- Photo there yet?
- It's printing. Let me put you on speaker.

364
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:19,461
That's an anti-Zuwanie rally.
The man speaking is Ajene Xola.

365
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,790
Look at the crowd.

366
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,702
<i>Look closely</i>.

367
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,575
Any leads?

368
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,910
Maybe one.

369
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:17,279
Come on down to Mexico.

370
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:29,823
Is that you?

371
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,333
Tell me what someone like you

372
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:41,100
who uses the word "diplomacy"
like she's chastising me

373
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:43,176
is doing at a rebel rally?

374
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:47,009
- A peace rally.
- I don't want to do this again.

375
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:51,187
That's exactly what it is.
What I'm doing is listening.

376
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,117
After that. After you listen.

377
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:57,191
- You're asking the wrong question.
- It's one you don't want to answer.

378
00:39:57,428 --> 00:40:01,990
Why would somebody type the names
of everyone in this on the back?

379
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,168
This is a death list.

380
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:12,069
The question you should be asking is,
"Who gave me this and why?"

381
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:19,205
- What are you not saying?
- What are you accusing me of?

382
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,409
How do you feel about Zuwanie,
never mind "I don't care for him"?

383
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:25,747
I feel disappointment.

384
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:29,617
That's a lover's word.

385
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:33,955
What about rage?

386
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,599
Of all the people I've looked into
since this thing started,

387
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:43,068
the one with the darkest
Zuwanie history is you.

388
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:48,476
- It was his land-mines that killed your...
- Sh!

389
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,140
We don't name the dead.

390
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:57,887
Everyone who loses somebody
wants revenge,

391
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,818
on God if they can't find anyone else.

392
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,517
But in Africa,

393
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:11,835
in Matobo, the Ku believe that
the only way to end grief is to save a life.

394
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:16,896
If someone is murdered,

395
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:22,340
a year of mourning ends with a ritual
that we call the Drowning Man Trial.

396
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:28,382
There's an all-night party beside a river.
At dawn, the killer is put in a boat.

397
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:34,080
He's taken out on the water and he's
dropped. He's bound so that he can't swim.

398
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:38,125
The family of the dead then has to choose.
They can let him drown,

399
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:40,330
or they can save him.

400
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:47,260
The Ku believe that if the family
lets the killer drown,

401
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:51,771
they'll have justice
but spend the rest of their lives in mourning.

402
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:58,748
But if they save him,
if they admit that life isn't always just...

403
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:04,352
...that very act can take away their sorrow.

404
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,558
Vengeance is a lazy form of grief.

405
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:25,637
Why do you look away?

406
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:32,171
There are things I don't like to talk about
and you call it lying.

407
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:35,481
But not when you do it.

408
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:40,046
I'm not the one under investigation.

409
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:49,222
That was a long time ago.

410
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,732
- <i>FBI</i>.
- <i>Intel</i>.

411
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,342
- TTF.
- Sniper team.

412
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:36,671
Secret Service.

413
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:40,850
This is Nils Lud,
head of Dr Zuwanie's security.

414
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:42,712
Shall we take a walk?

415
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:47,788
[She plays haunting melodic tune]

416
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:59,830
- How close can a vehicle get over here?
- Not close enough.

417
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:04,006
- No garage under the GA.
- Dogs sweep every night. It's not a bomb.

418
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:09,301
- It has to be a rifle.
- From where?

419
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,411
How does he get a rifle in?

420
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,884
- Could be from up close.
- Who gets that close?

421
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:25,721
One of Zuwanie's bodyguards?

422
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:31,265
That's a good thought, but we'd much prefer
to kill him at home without you watching.

423
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,470
It's already here.

424
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,703
If these guys know their stuff,
the weapon is here.

425
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,923
<i>[Phone rings]</i>

426
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:01,594
Hello?

427
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:05,529
- <i>[line crackles</i> - <i>no voice]</i>
- Hello, Philippe? Hello?

428
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:11,564
[She screams]

429
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:30,558
No prints on the door
and negative for latex dust.

430
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:33,058
- Nothing on the door?
- No.

431
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:37,833
- No forced entry.
- Did Doug not see him?

432
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:41,504
No, he missed it.
Some lady called 911, saw the guy.

433
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,640
Go easy on him, OK? He feels terrible.

434
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:51,947
On the roof. He must have gone over the roof
to get to the next building.

435
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:56,518
- I couldn't see the fire escape.
- Give me that.

436
00:45:57,621 --> 00:46:00,021
You mean you screwed up.

437
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:04,818
- I mean I screwed up.
- So did I.

438
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,665
I need Polaroids of that, inside and out.

439
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:15,104
- You OK?
- Great.

440
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:18,331
- Who else has a key to this apartment?
- No one.

441
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:21,601
- You don't keep a spare outside somewhere?
- No.

442
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:23,813
- No one else has a key...
- Nobody.

443
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:26,607
- The door wasn't forced.
- They can't pick locks?

444
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:30,183
They can, we can tell. They didn't.

445
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,513
- Where do you keep your key?
- My purse.

446
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:35,748
- It hasn't been out of your sight all day?
- No.

447
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,261
Yes.

448
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:44,933
In my locker.

449
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:50,732
Dot. Wake up Rory, have him dust her locker
and those beside it before morning.

450
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:57,280
So you were just having a quiet evening,
some gentleman in a mask waves to you.

451
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,041
That's about it, yeah.

452
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:02,309
[Something falls]

453
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:06,613
Dot?

454
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,822
Is there anything special about this mask?

455
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:15,896
I'll be honest with you.
I don't know how honest I can be with you.

456
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:21,169
My brother gave it to me.

457
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:25,999
I still have a brother there
who I'm close to. Simon.

458
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:33,183
We've... lost touch for a while,
but... we're close.

459
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:39,356
Is he standing on the road somewhere with
a machine-gun, or is he into diplomacy, too?

460
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,524
He's more into lists.

461
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,921
Farm kids will do anything
to amuse themselves. Mostly you fight.

462
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:51,525
I read. My brother kept lists.

463
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:53,998
Weird lists in ratty notebooks.

464
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:57,139
Times and dates that Mum used the F-word,

465
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:01,140
countries with advantageous
male to female ratios,

466
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,812
odd animal facts.

467
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:07,346
Did you know the leading cause of death
for beavers is falling trees?

468
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:10,951
- Yes.
- You did not.

469
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,215
He had a notebook for words that he liked.

470
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:20,021
Hypotenuse, doodad, bodacious.

471
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:24,263
Could he be involved in this?

472
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:33,040
We're stuck, aren't we? You and I?

473
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,805
We're <i>kepÃ©la</i>.

474
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:39,777
It means standing on
opposite sides of the river.

475
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,284
Give me a reason to get to the other side.

476
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,874
[Speaking Ku]

477
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,818
[Muffled cries]

478
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,626
Just wait a second.

479
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:44,546
OK.

480
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:57,716
There's a blue and white outside.
NYPD'll keep an eye on you until morning.

481
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,727
And then?

482
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,697
We'll figure something out.

483
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:08,097
Thank you.

484
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:29,687
My wife was killed two weeks ago.

485
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,397
She... she'd left me.

486
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:43,838
She'd left me before,
but she'd always come back.

487
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:46,542
She was going to come back this time.

488
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:48,768
She said.

489
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:57,282
She was a dancer.

490
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:02,983
The guy was a dancer, too.

491
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:05,719
Eddie.

492
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:10,695
Great dancer.

493
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:12,902
Lousy driver.

494
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:17,434
The only way he knew how to stop a car

495
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:21,166
was to slam it

496
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,974
So there was no taking her back this time.

497
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:36,393
The thing is, if he had lived,
and I had a choice...

498
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,698
...I think I would have let him drown.

499
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:50,134
I might have even
held his head under the water.

500
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:59,137
Not a very Ku thing to do.

501
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:12,561
If you need anything, you can call the precinct
or just go downstairs.

502

This is my cell number.

503
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:29,243
It's the same card.

506
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:46,553
It's a remodel. Owner's in the middle
of a divorce. We got lucky.

507
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,729
We got a clear view.
Front door's 50 seconds away.

508
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:58,134
- I'll do first shift.
- Are Lewis and Clark babysitting Kuman?

509
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:00,808
Lewis and King. He'll be in bed soon.

510
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:04,172
FBI's right.
Guy does the same routine every day.

511

another trick-or-treater. I'm off.

They cannot be separated.
They can only be said to exist...

You got one shot. You sever the brain stem,

you drop the perpetrator without reflex action.
He can't activate a detonator. Thank you.

520
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:50,991
If you have to issue a verbal warning,
you get very close before you do so.

No. There won't be time for a second one.

There's no profile for a suicide bomber.

524

This could be nine or 90, male or female,
a PhD or a dropout.

525

All they have in common
is they are not afraid to die.

526
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:13,676
So this is either a fanatic for a cause
or someone who has nothing to live for.

527
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:18,251
We'll run two teams. DDO calls the decoy exit
30 seconds before the intersection.

Her locker was clean.
The others were covered with prints.

530

Someone wiped hers. We're looking
at a janitor or a maintenance worker.

531

Or another interpreter.

532
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,920
So when do we do this voice line-up?

533
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:53,748
We're not doing that any more.

534

- She says she can't.
- Can't what?

535
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:02,530
ID the voice. She thought she could, now
she thinks she can't. She's sure she can't.

536
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:07,931
She can't because she can't, or because
she never heard anything to start with?

Afternoon. Secret Service.
Need to talk to Jad Jamal.

544
00:55:56,386 --> 00:56:00,322
- Does this guy live here?
- No, no here. With lady.

545
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:03,924
You got lady's number?

546
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,458
Does he have a cell phone?

547

- It is Simon.
- No, listen.

560
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:07,341
Someone contacted me.
One of Kuman's people...

561
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:12,317
I thought it was one of his people...
to arrange a meeting with Xola.

562
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:16,855
They said it was time to admit that
only together could they stop Zuwanie.

- What happened?
- So I arrange it.

No, Simon wasn't there. Only Xola.

- I don't know.

- I don't know what to think.

- Forgive me.

01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:33,581
- Go back. What's she doing?
- <i>Waiting for something</i>.

660
01:07:33,816 --> 01:07:36,216
- Holy shit.
- What?

661
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:38,716
The janitor. Jad Jamal.

662
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:42,549
- That's not him.
- I know. That's his room-mate.

663
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:55,803
Jamal's room-mate just left the building.

664
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:58,700
His name is Gamba. Jean Gamba.

665
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:02,308
- Should I stay here?
- No, you stick with the room-mate.

666
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:05,480
- Are we working on a warrant?
- Lewis is.

667
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,978
- How are you?
- I got something for you.

668
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,980
OK, bless you.

669
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:48,952
Tobin?

670
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:01,500
- What's up?
- I don't know, but it don't feel good.

671
01:09:04,106 --> 01:09:07,132
- What are they doing?
- Just standing there.

672
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,275
<i>We're getting on the el</i>.

673
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:25,986
[Speaks Ku]

674
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:32,093
- Shit.
- She just got on the bus with Kuman.

675
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:35,797
[Tobin] What the hell is she doing?

676
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:49,843
Did I hear home?

677
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:55,251
- Or was I wrong, then?
- No, you're right. I'm Matoban.

678
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:57,891
And a fair Matoban, in fact.

679
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:02,724
<i>[Tobin] King, you stay with that bus</i>.

680
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:08,759
Do you know who I am?

681
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:10,028
Yes.

682
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:15,435
You're a killer.
You ordered the murder of Ajene Xola.

683
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:27,521
You got a red light in that car?
Why don't you use it?

684
01:10:27,756 --> 01:10:32,056
- Who told you this nonsense?
- Where's my brother?

685
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:35,127
Your brother? I don't even know who you are.

686
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:40,599
You are on the wrong bus, so to speak,
to be so reckless.

687
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:52,405
Your people arranged a meeting
through Philippe Broullet.

688
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:56,277
- You know him.
- I don't... and I didn't.

689
01:10:56,518 --> 01:11:01,285
But the fact is, somebody wants you
to believe that I killed Ajene Xola.

690
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:07,384
- I don't believe you.
- [Kuman-Kuman] But you should believe me.

691
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:10,793
- Why?
- Because I would form a coalition with Xola.

692
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:14,965
Neither of us have made
enough progress alone.

693
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:18,332
He has the working people.
I have the finances.

694
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:24,103
If he is dead, it is a loss
for all of us. Me especially.

695
01:11:24,346 --> 01:11:26,576
<i>[Doug] We're getting off</i>.

696
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:32,579
I got the back room.

697
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:39,585
Jesus.

698
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:42,921
Clear the other room.

699
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:57,442
OK.

700
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,342
- Closet.
- Yeah. I got the bed.

701
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:17,363
[Dot] Ho! Keller?

702
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:23,499
- We got a dead body in the closet.
- Jamal?

703
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:28,335
Yeah. I'll call it in.
God, how can you see in here?

704
01:12:28,577 --> 01:12:30,340
Wait. Wait.

705
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:37,374
Why the lanterns?

706
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:43,183
Well, that's just rude.

707
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:10,510
- What do you do so far away from home?
- I work. And I hope.

708
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:14,211
- Same as me, then.
- I doubt it.

709
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:20,052
You work for?

710
01:13:20,295 --> 01:13:23,264
I'm an interpreter at the UN.

711
01:13:23,499 --> 01:13:27,595
So like the UN.
Layers of languages signifying nothing.

712
01:13:27,836 --> 01:13:30,600
- You'd prefer more war?
- I prefer more business.

713
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:33,603
Guys, get with me here. We got a situation.

714
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:39,075
No, boss, we got a situation.
We just got on the 133. With Mohammad.

715
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:42,806
<i>And Silvia Broome. And Kuman-Kuman</i>.

716
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:45,485
- What?
- You're on the same bus?

717
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:47,279
With our subjects.

718
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:51,118
Get off the bus,
and get Silvia Broome off that bus now.

719
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,760
We can't do that. We're moving.

720
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:57,295
Doug, is the room-mate carrying anything?

721
01:14:02,137 --> 01:14:05,265
- Doug, is he carrying anything?
- A satchel.

722
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:12,074
- All right... where is it?
- It's in his lap. He's been carrying it all day.

723
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:15,613
- Oh, man.
- Can either of you get to him?

724
01:14:17,686 --> 01:14:20,484
Not without gettin' made.

725
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:24,249
Despite all the flags on First Avenue,
there are no nations any more.

726
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:30,295
Only companies. International companies.
It's where we are. It's what we are.

727
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:35,996
I think you're wrong.

728
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:39,639
You are still young. I'm an acquired taste.

729
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:44,643
What's your brother's name?

730
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:50,510
Simon. Simon Broome.

731
01:14:50,752 --> 01:14:54,711
- OK, we're stopping.
- You got guts, coming out here.

732
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:01,023
I'll see what my people can find out about him.

733
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:06,291
But remember,
I'm not your brother's keeper, eh?

734
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:08,628
Yeah. Thank you.

735
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:13,374
Come on, guys, talk to me. What's going on?

736
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:16,203
We're stopped. She's getting off.

737
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:22,876
- What's going on?
- And so is my subject.

738
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:28,921
Keep talking to me. What's going on?
Is he carrying the satchel?

739
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:32,183
OK, he's got the satchel.
But I think he made me.

740
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:33,826
That's OK, I got him.

741
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:37,489
- Kuman?
- He's staying put.

742
01:15:37,733 --> 01:15:39,894
Miss Broome! Please get in the car.

743
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:43,534
Move it!

744
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:45,831
- I got Gamba.
- I'll stay with Kuman.

745
01:15:46,074 --> 01:15:50,875
No. Just get off that bus.
Get everybody off that bus right now!

746
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:56,012
- Doug!
- Mohammad?

747
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,950
- Hey! Guy forgot his lunch.
- Oh, man.

748
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:24,871
I'm standing here on Nostrand Avenue
in Crown Heights,

749
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:28,605
at a scene that can only be described
as unconscionable carnage.

750
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:32,809
...frantically helping victims
of an apparent terrorist attack.

751
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:36,752
These events are more familiar
in the cities of the Middle East.

752
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:41,292
There is no word yet.
However, there are unconfirmed reports

753
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:46,331
that Kuman-Kuman, the exiled Matoban
revolutionary, may have been on board.

754
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:48,593
- You all right?
- I'm OK.

755
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:51,431
Doug?

756
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:01,171
This is Ron Ferguson, reporting live
on Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn,

757
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:04,408
where just after 10.30 am this morning...

758
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:12,350
We're OK, boss.

759
01:17:15,063 --> 01:17:19,295
<i>[Reporter]</i>... <i>the violence has now found</i>
<i>its way into the heart of New York City</i>...

760
01:17:19,534 --> 01:17:24,335

- <i>The obvious speculation about al-Qaeda</i>...

761
01:17:24,573 --> 01:17:27,599

764
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:37,674
...<i>Zuwanie is still planning to address</i>
<i>the General Assembly of the UN</i>.

765
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:50,664
What were you doing on that bus?

766
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:54,634
Thank you for bringing me home.

767
01:18:03,979 --> 01:18:06,209
Hey!

768
01:18:08,617 --> 01:18:11,586
I lost a man today. A kid.

769
01:18:14,589 --> 01:18:17,353
- How do you know Kuman?
- I never met him before.

770
01:18:17,592 --> 01:18:21,187
You think that not getting caught in a lie
is the same as the truth!

771
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:24,558
- I'm not lying. I went to him for help.
- With what?

772
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,769
I can't tell you. Someone might get hurt.

773
01:18:28,003 --> 01:18:32,235
"Someone might get hurt. "
There's a bus full of dead people!

774
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:35,602
"Someone might get hurt"?
Who? Someone you know?

775
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:39,438
Someone who's mixed up in all this?
You? Why did you leave Africa?

776
01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:42,775
- I told you.
- No, you didn't. Why did you come here?

777
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:45,077
- Stop it.
- Goddammit!

778
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,220
- Stop shouting at me!
- Stop lying!

779
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:49,083
- I'm not lying!
- Stop lying!

780
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:54,626
I was just on that bus! I can't think
with all this noise. I can't! You have to stop!

781
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:18,943
That isn't me.

782
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:20,984
Don't be ridiculous.

783
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:25,552
- It isn't me.
- No, that is you.

784
01:19:25,794 --> 01:19:28,160
And I know, because I drive you home,

785
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:33,595
and I look at you through the binoculars,
and everything else that I shouldn't do.

786
01:19:37,839 --> 01:19:40,933
It was once.

787
01:19:41,176 --> 01:19:43,167
It's not any more.

788
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:50,174
After the rallies,
after my parents and sister were killed,

789
01:19:50,418 --> 01:19:52,784
then the rifles came out.

790
01:19:54,389 --> 01:19:58,291
It was the only way to get anyone to listen.
Just to listen.

791
01:20:02,063 --> 01:20:07,592
I killed a boy who had nothing to live for
beyond the money he'd get for killing me.

792
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:12,496
I shot him in the head
so he wouldn't shoot me.

793
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:22,010
Then I handed the rifle to my brother
and told him, "I'm through. "

794
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:26,880
I walked away with him shouting at me,
"You're a coward. "

795
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:30,285
"Our parents are dead, Zuwanie's alive. "

796
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:36,723
My brother,
who in another life wouldn't harm a...

797
01:20:41,236 --> 01:20:44,069
That was the last thing he ever said to me.

798
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:48,640
The only contact I have is the notebooks
I send and imagine him receiving.

799
01:20:48,877 --> 01:20:51,539
I know he's alive. I know it.

800
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:55,210
But I'm not to him.

801
01:21:00,155 --> 01:21:02,988
I lied to you because I was afraid.

802
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:07,323
I was afraid
he might be involved in what I heard.

803
01:21:10,432 --> 01:21:14,334
I lied to everyone else
so they'd let me near the UN,

804
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:19,472
and that's the only place that I believe
has a chance to change any of this.

805
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:24,008
And I lied to you about Ajene Xola because...

806
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:26,976
I loved him. Once.

807
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:31,541
Until the colour of my skin became a problem.

808
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:34,016
The politics of my skin.

809
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:42,522
I walked away from Africa with nothing.
No brother, no family, no lover, nothing.

810
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:47,861
Just a belief that words and compassion
are the better way.

811
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:51,867
Even if it's slower than a gun.

812
01:22:01,182 --> 01:22:03,412
Where are you going?

813
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:07,214
You've got blood all over your face.

814
01:22:07,455 --> 01:22:10,754
You can't say stuff like that
with blood on your face.

815
01:23:53,495 --> 01:23:56,362
- [Protesters shouting]
- [Man speaking Ku]

816
01:23:56,598 --> 01:24:00,056
This is precisely why Dr Zuwanie
must be allowed to speak.

817
01:24:02,737 --> 01:24:05,729
[Translation] This monstrous act of terrorism
was aimed at you...

818
01:24:08,443 --> 01:24:11,071
...and at the heart of the United Nations.

819
01:24:11,312 --> 01:24:14,941
- I can't listen to this.
- Do not allow them to intimidate you...

820
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:17,377

01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:32,163

- Bathroom.

01:24:37,539 --> 01:24:39,166
Keller.

824
01:24:59,894 --> 01:25:03,057
Get this processed and back to me right away.

825
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:36,090
Did he leave a note?

826
01:25:41,703 --> 01:25:43,830
Did you read it?

827
01:25:44,072 --> 01:25:46,336
Of course you did.

828
01:25:49,878 --> 01:25:52,870
Would you read it to me, please?

829
01:26:02,957 --> 01:26:08,554
"Dear Silvia, I came to tell you something
and then didn't. "

830
01:26:09,697 --> 01:26:13,827
"I wanted to, but when I saw you
I couldn't find the words. "

831
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:20,666
"I told you I didn't know where Simon is.
That was a lie. "

832
01:26:20,909 --> 01:26:24,367
"He was there that day.
A young boy shot him. "

833
01:26:28,149 --> 01:26:31,585
"I couldn't tell you. I'm a coward.
Simon was braver than me. "

834
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:34,413
"You're braver than me. I'm so sorry. "

835
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:37,056
I'm so sorry.

836
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:42,886
The second time was me.

837
01:26:57,078 --> 01:27:01,242
I feel like my friends must feel
when they try to say something.

838
01:27:03,518 --> 01:27:07,215
- It's all right.
- That's what I say to them.

839
01:27:20,535 --> 01:27:22,765
He left this with the note.

840
01:27:29,811 --> 01:27:33,542
The only thing that I wanted...

841
01:27:40,622 --> 01:27:43,250

842
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:45,652

01:49:01,768 --> 01:49:04,168
- Cover here. I'll take the hall.
- Where's Keller?

989
01:49:04,404 --> 01:49:05,962
Freeze!

990
01:49:16,983 --> 01:49:20,384
Incredible. Thank God I looked up.

991
01:49:20,620 --> 01:49:23,054
- He's from our mission.
- I know. Holster your weapon.

992
01:49:25,492 --> 01:49:27,790
Dr Zuwanie.

993
01:49:29,195 --> 01:49:31,254
I remember the last time you were here.

994
01:49:31,498 --> 01:49:37,130
- <i>[security] Use the 42nd Street exit</i>.
- We almost had an assassination here.

995
01:49:37,370 --> 01:49:38,962
<i>[Security] Please move</i>...

996
01:49:39,205 --> 01:49:42,766
We watched you on the telly back home.

997
01:49:43,009 --> 01:49:47,605
My family. All the families.
You were like the Beatles.

998
01:49:47,847 --> 01:49:52,045
Two or three more seconds,
he would have assassinated him.

999
01:49:52,285 --> 01:49:55,448
<i>An almost-assassinated leader</i>
<i>gets so much credibility</i>

1000
01:49:55,689 --> 01:49:59,591

1001

1005

What is your name, child?

1006
01:50:23,216 --> 01:50:25,582
I'm the Silvia whose family you killed.

1007

- It's... Just a precaution.

1008

He must've been very surprised.

1009
01:50:35,362 --> 01:50:37,592
He thought it was a live round.

1010
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,935

- But you knew better.

I grew up seeing you with this gun.
It's the gun you saved our country with.

1014
01:51:02,422 --> 01:51:04,788
- Drop the gun!
- Put it down!

1015
01:51:05,025 --> 01:51:07,186
Keller, US Secret Service.

1016
01:51:08,094 --> 01:51:11,393
It's the same one you used to kill it.

1017
01:51:11,631 --> 01:51:15,533
- He's got a Glock on his hip.
- Code 100 in the sound room.

1018
01:51:23,576 --> 01:51:24,975
Look at it.

1019
01:51:29,983 --> 01:51:31,314
Look at it!

1020
01:51:36,189 --> 01:51:40,683
- Careful. The bleeder had AIDS.
- There's no way you can prove this.

1021
01:51:40,927 --> 01:51:43,862
You'll cop a plea.
You're just an employee, right?

1022
01:51:44,097 --> 01:51:48,363
- He's in custody. They're bringing him down.
- SWAT team's at 42nd Street.

1023
01:51:49,836 --> 01:51:52,031
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Where's Zuwanie?

1024
01:51:52,272 --> 01:51:54,900
- The safe room. What happened?
- It was a fake.

1025
01:51:55,141 --> 01:51:59,339
A piece of theatre to justify the killing.
Ethnic cleansing, genocide.

1026
01:51:59,579 --> 01:52:02,776
You there? That's the flight. She's not on it.

1027
01:52:03,016 --> 01:52:05,541
I checked every hotel in New York,
her friends.

1028
01:52:05,785 --> 01:52:08,777
They don't know where she'd go.
No one knows her.

1029
01:52:09,022 --> 01:52:12,116
- I know her.
- OK, where is she?

1030
01:52:12,358 --> 01:52:15,521
- She said she was going home.
- <i>[Silvia] I'm going home</i>...

1031
01:52:15,762 --> 01:52:17,093
What home?

1032
01:52:17,330 --> 01:52:21,289
- How'd you happen to be there after hours?
- <i>[Silvia] An evacuation. I left some things</i>.

<i>I wouldn't mind if he were gone</i>.

1034

She's here. She's been in that room all night.

1035
01:52:27,273 --> 01:52:31,539
How could someone so good, so...

1036
01:52:32,679 --> 01:52:35,307
How could you give us so much,

1037
01:52:36,483 --> 01:52:37,882

1038

- Yeah.

01:53:13,987 --> 01:53:17,684
- Close it!
- Silvia, don't do this.

1048
01:53:17,924 --> 01:53:22,327
It was all just theatre, an almost-assassination
meant to justify his acts.

- We've got all we need to prosecute.
- I have him.

1050

- He'll die in prison.
- I want him to die how Simon died.

That'll be over in two seconds,
and you'll have all your years.

1052

Sir, it's a lot worse than you think.
Your so-called assassin is dead.

1053

Your head of security is making a deal.

1054
01:53:40,713 --> 01:53:44,672
We have Lud and the rifle.
You'll be tried before two courts.

1055
01:53:44,918 --> 01:53:47,819
- He's been tried!
- Sir, you're finished.

1056
01:53:48,054 --> 01:53:53,287
- It doesn't matter!
- Silvia. Listen to me.

1057
01:53:53,526 --> 01:53:56,154
I told you I'd let him drown.

into a bridge abutment.

1059
01:54:01,868 --> 01:54:04,803
- But I wouldn't.
- Then you'd be wrong.

1060
01:54:05,038 --> 01:54:09,907
No, I wouldn't be wrong. I don't want
to spend the rest of my life in mourning.

I can't do that. So put the gun down.

01:54:28,895 --> 01:54:32,331
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Put it down.

I can't! I can't... I can't.
