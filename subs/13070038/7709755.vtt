<i>All of us have demons.</i>

2
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:00.269
-All I want is a relationship
with my daughter.

3
00:01:00.368 --> 00:01:03.239
-He's an alcoholic
and so were you.

4
00:01:04.874 --> 00:01:06.641
<i>You face them.</i>

5
00:01:06.674 --> 00:01:09.278
<i>And just when you think
you're winning,</i>

6
00:01:09.311 --> 00:01:10.880
<i>it turns out.</i>

7
00:01:10.913 --> 00:01:13.514
<i>They weren't your demons
to begin with.</i>

8
00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:15.184
What the fuck?

9
00:01:15.285 --> 00:01:16.853
-Oh, fu...

10
00:01:16.953 --> 00:01:17.653
-Vance!

11
00:01:17.753 --> 00:01:18.889
It's not what you think.

12
00:01:18.955 --> 00:01:20.489
You're getting married tomorrow!

13
00:01:20.623 --> 00:01:23.159
-I was gonna tell you ages ago,
but your mom didn't want.

14
00:01:23.226 --> 00:01:24.226
-Tell me what?

15
00:01:24.327 --> 00:01:27.030
-Hardin is Christian's son.

16
00:01:27.864 --> 00:01:29.065
- I'm so sorry.
- Fuck off!

I'll get one of those.

44
00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.620
Your dad.

45
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:28.623
Ken.

46
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.396
You know, we were like brothers.

47
00:03:33.496 --> 00:03:35.131
-And then you fucked his wife.

48
00:03:35.197 --> 00:03:36.564
-That's not how it was.

49
00:03:38.434 --> 00:03:40.336
I loved your mum.

50
00:03:40.436 --> 00:03:41.837
She was head over heels
with him.

51
00:03:43.738 --> 00:03:47.610
But then when he went to
university, he wasn't there.

52
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.578
He was wandering around.
He was always busy.

53
00:03:49.712 --> 00:03:54.750
And. She turned to me
for emotional support.

54
00:03:57.354 --> 00:03:58.855
That's how it became intimate.

55
00:03:58.955 --> 00:04:01.258
- Spare me
the fucking details, okay?

56
00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.296
-I had this ridiculous notion
that we'd run off together and.

57
00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:12.336
She'd marry me instead of Ken.

58
00:04:12.437 --> 00:04:15.173
Then they announced
they were expecting.

59
00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.875
And that was that.

60
00:04:21.212 --> 00:04:22.712
-This is just brilliant.

61
00:04:24.982 --> 00:04:28.619
And mum, Ken and you lying to me
my entire fucking life.

62
00:04:30.322 --> 00:04:31.789
-Ken didn't know.

63
00:04:35.793 --> 00:04:37.930
I think deep down
he's always suspected her.

64
00:04:39.865 --> 00:04:42.334
That was when
he really started drinking.

65
00:04:44.635 --> 00:04:46.704
-You could have
stopped all of it.

66
00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:48.874
My entire fucking life
could have been different

67
00:04:48.941 --> 00:04:50.910
if you weren't
such a fucking coward.

68
00:04:58.885 --> 00:05:03.755
-Smith, you can
go dance with them. Go on.

69
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.092
-Does he know
that hardin is his brother?

70
00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:20.107
Where's hardin?

71
00:05:20.508 --> 00:05:21.876
-I don't know. He bolted.

72
00:05:22.576 --> 00:05:23.410
-What?

73
00:05:23.511 --> 00:05:25.146
-Maybe he needed some space.

74
00:05:26.413 --> 00:05:27.714
Wait, Tessa.

75
00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:12.261
<i>Oh,
Christian, you should see him.</i>

76
00:06:12.295 --> 00:06:14.063
<i>He's growing up so fast.</i>

77
00:06:14.096 --> 00:06:17.601
<i>He's a little man now.</i>

78
00:06:17.634 --> 00:06:18.701
<i>And so talented.</i>

79
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:21.638
His essay got chosen
to run in a paper.

80
00:06:21.672 --> 00:06:23.006
<i>Well done, hardin.</i>

81
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.875
<i>Can you tell him I said that?</i>

82
00:06:25.008 --> 00:06:26.343
He's brilliant.

83
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.213
He's like his father.

84
00:06:29.346 --> 00:06:32.715
Look, I gotta get going.
Um, let's talk again soon.

85
00:06:32.748 --> 00:06:33.783
<i>Yeah. Of course.</i>

86
00:06:33.884 --> 00:06:34.884
Bye, Christian.

87
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.323
-Hey, keep it down.

88
00:06:43.595 --> 00:06:44.595
Ken!

89
00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:48.299
-Hardin, who gave this to you?

90
00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:49.366
-Vance.

91
00:06:55.607 --> 00:06:57.087
- Ken! Ken!
- Stop! You're ruining it!

92
00:06:57.175 --> 00:06:58.177
Hardin!

93
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:03.849
I'm so sorry.

94
00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:05.217
<i>Hardin?</i>

95
00:07:12.091 --> 00:07:13.659
I've been looking for you.

96
00:07:16.829 --> 00:07:18.197
-Wanna drink?

97
00:07:18.297 --> 00:07:19.798
-No.

98
00:07:24.004 --> 00:07:25.639
Come on,
let's go back to the hotel.

99
00:07:25.739 --> 00:07:28.008
-Not yet.

100
00:07:28.141 --> 00:07:29.709
Okay. Please, hardin,

101
00:07:29.843 --> 00:07:32.712
I'm really cold and tired.
And I just wanna go back...

102
00:07:32.778 --> 00:07:34.023
-Tessa, you're not the one
who just found out

103
00:07:34.047 --> 00:07:35.215
his entire life was a lie.

104
00:07:35.348 --> 00:07:37.517
So, either
have a drink with me or go.

105
00:07:43.924 --> 00:07:45.426
-Okay.
I'm gonna get us an uber.

106
00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:52.799
You know, I'm pretty sure

107
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.369
that she would have
locked it before she left.

108
00:07:57.538 --> 00:07:58.572
Hey!

109
00:08:12.587 --> 00:08:14.222
-Hardin, please.
I know you're upset,

110
00:08:14.289 --> 00:08:15.957
and I know you're angry.
And you should...

111
00:08:16.058 --> 00:08:17.225
-You know, I hear her screams

112
00:08:17.292 --> 00:08:19.361
every single time
I walk in this place.

113
00:08:19.461 --> 00:08:20.162
Okay, we need to leave.

114
00:08:20.228 --> 00:08:21.563
-Years I've spent hating a man

115
00:08:21.697 --> 00:08:24.100
who as it turns out, I didn't
even need to fucking like!

116
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.635
Don't touch me.

117
00:08:25.868 --> 00:08:27.112
What's the plan?
What are you gonna do here?

118
00:08:27.136 --> 00:08:28.380
Are you gonna burn
your mother's house down?

119
00:08:28.404 --> 00:08:29.982
-I'm gonna burn
the fucking place down, yeah.

120
00:08:30.006 --> 00:08:31.016
-So, you're gonna get arrested,
you know that? Right?

121
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.308
-Which is why you should leave.

122
00:08:32.375 --> 00:08:35.345
-No! I'm not...
I'm not going without you.

123
00:08:35.411 --> 00:08:36.946
-Tess.

124
00:08:37.046 --> 00:08:38.190
"If two people love each other,

125
00:08:38.214 --> 00:08:39.224
there can be
no happy end to it."

126
00:08:39.248 --> 00:08:41.184
-Don't quote Hemingway at me.

127
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:42.328
-Why are you always
trying to find

128
00:08:42.352 --> 00:08:43.595
some sort of light in me, Tessa?

129
00:08:43.619 --> 00:08:45.622
Wake up.
There is no fucking light.

130
00:08:45.723 --> 00:08:47.224
I have fucked up parents,

131
00:08:47.291 --> 00:08:48.335
fucked up past.
- Look at my parents!

132
00:08:48.359 --> 00:08:49.927
-So, I have a fucked up head
now!

133
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.204
-My dad's homeless,
for god's sake.

134
00:08:51.228 --> 00:08:53.197
-It's not a fucking competition!

135
00:09:03.507 --> 00:09:05.209
Hardin, please,
give me the lighter.

136
00:09:10.515 --> 00:09:12.635
Please, hardin, can you think
about what you're doing?

137
00:09:32.438 --> 00:09:33.438
-Hardin?

138
00:09:33.472 --> 00:09:34.206
Oh, my god.

139
00:09:34.306 --> 00:09:35.741
Hardin, we gotta get out here.

140
00:09:35.842 --> 00:09:37.176
-Get the fuck off me!

141
00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:38.276
-We need to go!

142
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:39.846
All right, Tessa,
you take my car.

143
00:09:39.979 --> 00:09:41.580
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. I've got him.

144
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.692
Come on, man, we need to go.
- Now, you wanna play hero?

145
00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:44.885
Where were you?

146
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.610
Where were you
when she was being beaten

147
00:09:46.685 --> 00:09:48.020
to a bloody fucking pulp?

148
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.456
Fuck away from me!

149
00:09:50.624 --> 00:09:52.559
You're too late!

150
00:09:52.626 --> 00:09:53.727
-I'm sorry, all right?

151
00:09:53.827 --> 00:09:55.395
- I don't care.
- I'm sorry!

152
00:09:55.462 --> 00:09:56.462
Come here.

153
00:09:56.563 --> 00:09:59.433
I am sorry.
I should have been here for her.

154
00:09:59.499 --> 00:10:01.401
Listen to me!

155
00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:03.303
I should have been here.

156
00:10:03.437 --> 00:10:06.339
But you ruining your life
isn't gonna make hers better.

157
00:10:10.043 --> 00:10:11.679
We need to go!

158
00:10:11.813 --> 00:10:13.714
Come on!
Get out, now!

159
00:10:18.419 --> 00:10:19.554
Go, go!

160
00:10:22.925 --> 00:10:24.392
Go.

<i>Dispatches unit.</i>

162
00:11:22.152 --> 00:11:23.220
-Where are we?

163
00:11:23.354 --> 00:11:25.022
-I don't know where.
I just kept driving.

164
00:11:26.892 --> 00:11:28.092
-Where's Vance? Is he.?

165
00:11:28.192 --> 00:11:29.793
-I texted him. He's okay.

166
00:11:29.895 --> 00:11:32.062
But, um.

167
00:11:32.162 --> 00:11:35.432
He told the police
that he started the fire.

168
00:11:38.103 --> 00:11:39.404
-He's got lawyers.

169
00:11:41.506 --> 00:11:42.851
And that's not
gonna change anything.

170
00:11:42.875 --> 00:11:45.477
He still lied to me
for 21 years.

171
00:11:45.544 --> 00:11:47.612
-He's your father.

172
00:11:47.679 --> 00:11:48.680
-As of yesterday.

173
00:11:51.283 --> 00:11:52.684
We should get back.

174
00:12:20.147 --> 00:12:21.315

-No.

178
00:12:28.522 --> 00:12:30.490
Not right now anyways.

179
00:12:39.232 --> 00:12:40.435
Pull over.

00:13:12.601 --> 00:13:13.736
-Why?

182
00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:24.781
Because.

183
00:13:28.184 --> 00:13:30.420
Because I just keep dragging you
into my shit, Tessa.

184
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.788
It's not fair.

185
00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:35.792
-Please don't push me away.

186
00:13:43.901 --> 00:13:44.902

Kimberly, Tessa's here.

219
00:16:59.806 --> 00:17:01.876
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

220
00:17:01.976 --> 00:17:03.010
-Where's hardin?

221
00:17:06.613 --> 00:17:09.682
-I could feel him withdrawing
with every breath.

222
00:17:14.454 --> 00:17:16.223
I'm-I'm sorry.

223
00:17:16.357 --> 00:17:17.258
I don't want to
bother you with this.

224
00:17:17.358 --> 00:17:18.599
You're already going through...

225
00:17:18.626 --> 00:17:22.264
-No. Tessa,
there is no rule that says

226
00:17:22.396 --> 00:17:25.733
only one person
can be in pain at a time.

227
00:17:25.799 --> 00:17:28.469
And for selfish reasons,
hearing about your problems

228
00:17:28.602 --> 00:17:30.939
makes me feel slightly
better about my own.

229
00:17:33.008 --> 00:17:34.008
Talk to me.

230
00:17:34.642 --> 00:17:36.543
-I feel like I'm drowning.

231
00:17:39.648 --> 00:17:41.951
And I want to make it work,
but I just.

232
00:17:43.785 --> 00:17:46.521
I don't know
if I can keep fighting

233
00:17:46.655 --> 00:17:49.859
against the current to save him
rather than myself.

234
00:17:53.528 --> 00:17:54.964
Yeah.

248
00:19:09.142 --> 00:19:10.819
You look just like a guy
I used to party with.

a guy who was high 24/7.

Hey, sit down, man. Sit.

255
00:19:22.322 --> 00:19:23.722
Look at you, bougie as fuck.

256
00:19:23.822 --> 00:19:26.659
-Ah.
You still look like shit.

257
00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.803
-What've you got?
A job interview?

258
00:19:29.296 --> 00:19:31.631
Still funny as fuck, huh, James.

259
00:19:31.731 --> 00:19:32.632

260
00:19:32.732 --> 00:19:34.235

00:19:45.545 --> 00:19:46.545
Great.

if you're hot.

Yo, give me that damn vodka.

296
00:21:49.742 --> 00:21:51.611

my new friend here a drink.

302
00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:14.144
-What? You're the only one
who gets to break things?

303
00:22:14.168 --> 00:22:15.546
-You didn't tell me
you had a girlfriend.

304
00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:17.271
What the hell is wrong with you?

305
00:22:17.371 --> 00:22:18.917
What? Do you think you're
just gonna slum it here

306
00:22:18.941 --> 00:22:19.984
and you'll forget
about your problem?

307
00:22:20.008 --> 00:22:21.376
-Why the fuck are you even here?

308
00:22:21.476 --> 00:22:23.676
-I'm not letting you get away
with being a coward again.

309
00:22:26.281 --> 00:22:27.961
I'm giving you one chance
to leave with me.

310
00:22:28.016 --> 00:22:30.185
But if I walk out the door
without you, that's it.

311
00:22:39.228 --> 00:22:41.064
-So, um, if she isn't
your girlfriend.

312
00:22:43.832 --> 00:22:44.701
-Just get the fuck away!

313
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.202
Tessa, outside, now.

314
00:22:48.171 --> 00:22:49.451

Scott.

315
00:22:53.775 --> 00:22:54.843
-Tess, what the fuck?

316
00:22:54.978 --> 00:22:57.013
-This is bullshit, hardin.
This isn't us.

317
00:22:57.113 --> 00:23:00.250
-Us? What "us", Tess?
There is no us.

318
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:02.686
We. We keep going round

00:25:51.328 --> 00:25:53.398
-Well, that was
one hell of a dream, man.

368
00:25:53.532 --> 00:25:54.532
Ooh.

369
00:25:57.235 --> 00:25:58.670
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

370
00:25:58.737 --> 00:25:59.906
-Oh, fuck.

371
00:26:00.005 --> 00:26:01.206
Your hand looks pretty bad.

372
00:26:02.574 --> 00:26:04.376
Ah, it's not that bad.
I'll be fine.

373
00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:07.112
Bro, you were fucking wrecked.

374
00:26:10.081 --> 00:26:11.383
-Hey, that American girl?

375
00:26:11.516 --> 00:26:13.595
I thought she was gonna tear
the whole place down, bro.

376
00:26:13.619 --> 00:26:14.654
-She was a bitch.

377
00:26:47.454 --> 00:26:48.455
-Dad?

378
00:26:52.693 --> 00:26:53.693
Dad?

379
00:26:56.364 --> 00:26:57.364
Dad?

380
00:27:11.947 --> 00:27:13.214
Dad?

381
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.034
Oh no, no!
- It's okay. It's okay.

382
00:27:32.167 --> 00:27:33.469
I got you, I got you.

383
00:28:46.046 --> 00:28:47.580
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

384
00:28:50.116 --> 00:28:51.284
Strong enough for you?

385
00:28:51.384 --> 00:28:52.544
Yeah.
It wasn't strong enough.

386
00:28:53.887 --> 00:28:55.089
Hardin, your phone's ringing.

387
00:28:55.188 --> 00:28:57.091
It's Landon.

388
00:28:57.123 --> 00:28:58.758
<i>Mr. Scott's very busy
at the moment.</i>

389
00:28:58.791 --> 00:29:00.126
<i>Can I take him...</i>
- Hey.

390
00:29:00.226 --> 00:29:01.661
Whoa-oh!

391
00:29:02.562 --> 00:29:04.031
-Landon,
if I wanted to talk to you,

392
00:29:04.098 --> 00:29:06.576
I would have picked up the phone
the other 30 times you called.

393
00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.502
<i>You know what? I know
you're a selfish prick.</i>

394
00:29:08.535 --> 00:29:10.081
<i>I thought you could help,
but, you know what?</i>

395
00:29:10.105 --> 00:29:11.848
<i>She's... she's... she's gonna
get through this without you.</i>

396
00:29:11.872 --> 00:29:13.707
-Get through what?

397
00:29:13.807 --> 00:29:14.807
La...?

398
00:29:23.217 --> 00:29:25.219
Landon? What's wrong?

399
00:29:25.252 --> 00:29:26.454
<i>Just tell me she's okay.</i>

400
00:29:27.756 --> 00:29:28.756
-It's, um.

401
00:29:31.393 --> 00:29:33.395
It's Richard. He's dead.

402
00:29:33.428 --> 00:29:35.563
<i>And, uh, Tessa found him.</i>

403
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:39.935
-Fuck.

404
00:29:40.036 --> 00:29:41.670
Oh, fuck.

405
00:29:43.039 --> 00:29:44.873
Um. Where... where is she?

406
00:29:45.007 --> 00:29:46.008
-We're at her mom's.

407
00:29:46.174 --> 00:29:47.710
She hasn't.
She hasn't spoken a word.

408
00:29:49.512 --> 00:29:51.247
-Can you let me talk to her?

409
00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:52.700
-I don't think
that's a good idea.

410
00:29:52.748 --> 00:29:53.649
-Please.

411
00:29:53.716 --> 00:29:55.685
Please just put the phone
to her ear.

412
00:29:55.785 --> 00:29:57.329
-You know, you really shouldn't
be speaking to her.

413
00:29:57.353 --> 00:29:58.530
-Then why the fuck did you call?

414
00:29:58.554 --> 00:29:59.422
Of course, I'm who she needs!

415
00:29:59.522 --> 00:30:00.991
You know us!
You know me!

416
00:30:01.024 --> 00:30:02.291
<i>All right, fine.</i>

417
00:30:02.391 --> 00:30:04.660
Just stay calm, okay?
Just give me a second.

418
00:30:12.836 --> 00:30:13.836
Hey, Tessa.

419
00:30:15.505 --> 00:30:16.273
I have hardin on the phone
for you.

420
00:30:16.339 --> 00:30:17.808
-Um-mm, um-mm, um-umm.

421
00:30:17.874 --> 00:30:19.452
- Okay, okay. You don't have to.
- No, no. No, no.

422
00:30:19.476 --> 00:30:21.311
<i>No. No. No.
- It's fine.</i>

423
00:30:21.344 --> 00:30:23.480
- <i>Please, no!</i>
<i>- Don't worry.</i>
<i>It's fine.</i>
- Tess.

424
00:30:24.982 --> 00:30:26.383
Fuck!

425
00:30:42.201 --> 00:30:43.301
Oh!

426
00:31:03.555 --> 00:31:05.290
-I mean, it's gonna be
me or your mom

427
00:31:05.424 --> 00:31:07.426
and she's gonna make you eat it.

428
00:31:08.327 --> 00:31:09.896
Looks pretty good.

429
00:31:11.597 --> 00:31:13.500
I'm just so tired.

430
00:31:15.835 --> 00:31:16.835
-Hmm.

431
00:31:32.019 --> 00:31:34.588
<i>You're enjoying yourself.</i>

432
00:31:34.688 --> 00:31:37.825
-One little slip
and it could all be over.

433
00:31:39.794 --> 00:31:41.462
-Are you still talking
about my shave?

434
00:31:46.101 --> 00:31:47.368
-I meant the shave,

435
00:31:47.468 --> 00:31:49.470
but if you wanted to
talk about last night.

436
00:31:51.072 --> 00:31:53.307
-I'm sorry, Tess.

437
00:31:53.407 --> 00:31:55.376
I didn't mean to
get that trashed.

438
00:31:55.409 --> 00:31:56.778
It's just with your dad...

439
00:31:56.812 --> 00:31:58.080
<i>I'm not my dad. I'm not him.</i>

440
00:31:59.748 --> 00:32:01.383
Tess, if you don't like it,
tell me.

441
00:32:01.483 --> 00:32:03.385
- I don't like it.
- Then I'll stop.

442
00:32:04.519 --> 00:32:05.687
I won't drink another drop.

443
00:32:05.821 --> 00:32:07.089
-Really?

444
00:32:24.041 --> 00:32:25.041
What... what are you.?

445
00:32:54.404 --> 00:32:55.873
She doesn't want you here.

446
00:32:55.974 --> 00:32:56.840
I didn't fly

447
00:32:56.941 --> 00:32:58.421
5,000 fucking miles
to argue with you.

448
00:32:58.475 --> 00:32:59.743
I don't know if she's awake.

449
00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:01.189
Let me just at least see
if she's... hardin!

450
00:33:01.213 --> 00:33:02.248
-Tess.

451
00:33:02.348 --> 00:33:03.349
Hey.
- No. No, no.

452
00:33:03.448 --> 00:33:04.250
No, no, no.
- Hey, hey, hey.

453
00:33:04.382 --> 00:33:05.617
-Do you want him here, Tess?

454
00:33:05.717 --> 00:33:07.195
-You're fucked if you think
I'm going anywhere.

455
00:33:07.219 --> 00:33:07.953
Tess.
- No, get off me!

456
00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.321
-Hey, it's okay.

457
00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:10.420
You gotta leave.

458
00:33:10.555 --> 00:33:11.765
You gotta leave
or I'm calling the cops?

459
00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:13.069
-Call the fucking cops.
Call 'em.

460
00:33:13.158 --> 00:33:14.668
I'm not going anywhere!
- That's not funny!

461
00:33:14.692 --> 00:33:16.537
- I'm not laughing!
- She doesn't want you here!

462
00:33:16.561 --> 00:33:18.264
You have no fucking idea
what she wants!

463
00:33:18.396 --> 00:33:19.573
-You weren't here
when she needed you!

464
00:33:19.597 --> 00:33:21.533
Now, you're make...
You're making it worse.

465
00:33:23.136 --> 00:33:24.337
- Tess?

466
00:33:24.436 --> 00:33:26.605
-Ugh, she's trying to avoid you.

467
00:33:26.705 --> 00:33:27.865
You're the reason she took...

468
00:33:32.645 --> 00:33:33.980
-I'll check the front door.

469
00:34:00.174 --> 00:34:01.608
Hey, hey, Tess.

470
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:05.713
-It's not about you.

471
00:34:05.813 --> 00:34:07.049
-I know.
I... I just want to...

472
00:34:07.082 --> 00:34:08.116
I need <i>quiet </i>.

473
00:34:09.684 --> 00:34:10.684
Please.

474
00:34:52.997 --> 00:34:55.232
-I haven't always
treated you fairly.

475
00:34:55.366 --> 00:34:57.267
-You hate me, Carol.

476
00:34:57.368 --> 00:34:58.368
You've always hated me.

477
00:34:58.402 --> 00:34:59.769
And it's fine. I don't care.

478
00:34:59.902 --> 00:35:02.406
But you should know your opinion
means fuck all to me.

479
00:35:02.538 --> 00:35:04.375
And I mean that
in the nicest way.

480
00:35:04.441 --> 00:35:05.775
-You're exactly like him.

481
00:35:05.909 --> 00:35:07.921
That's exactly how Richard
used to talk to my parents.

482
00:35:07.945 --> 00:35:09.180
-I am not him.

483
00:35:09.247 --> 00:35:10.681
-All right. Well.

484
00:35:10.748 --> 00:35:12.783
I only care
about what's best for Tessa.

485
00:35:12.917 --> 00:35:14.152
-So do I.

486
00:35:14.252 --> 00:35:17.322
-The one thing that
I thought that I taught her,

487
00:35:17.455 --> 00:35:19.857
and you may not believe me,

488
00:35:19.958 --> 00:35:24.162
was to not have to depend on
a man the way that I did.

489
00:35:24.295 --> 00:35:26.530
And now, look at her.

490
00:35:26.663 --> 00:35:29.667
She's... she's reduced to nothing
every time you leave.

491
00:35:29.734 --> 00:35:32.304
- Listen, I'm not...
- No, no. Let me finish.

492
00:35:32.371 --> 00:35:34.672
Yeah, you always come back

493
00:35:34.806 --> 00:35:38.077
the way that Richard
never did for us.

494
00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:39.711
But you never stay.

495
00:35:45.817 --> 00:35:48.154
-I don't know
what you want from me, Carol.

496
00:35:48.287 --> 00:35:49.455
I love her.

497
00:35:49.522 --> 00:35:50.990
I'm never letting her go.

498
00:35:51.091 --> 00:35:53.460
-If you really love her, then
you'll do what's best for her.

499
00:35:53.527 --> 00:35:55.028
And that is up to you now.

500
00:35:55.128 --> 00:35:57.964
Because you are the only person
that she'll listen to.

501
00:35:58.031 --> 00:36:00.733
That girl loves you way too much
for her own good.

502
00:36:01.567 --> 00:36:04.570
But hardin, you and I both know

503
00:36:04.703 --> 00:36:06.907
that you can't give her
what she needs.

504
00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:11.111
And that is stopping her
from finding someone who will.

505
00:36:30.331 --> 00:36:32.666
-I can only imagine
how you're feeling right now.

506
00:36:36.305 --> 00:36:39.707
I keep thinking about
the last time I saw him.

507
00:36:39.807 --> 00:36:41.642
He was eating
half my damn pizza.

508
00:36:41.709 --> 00:36:45.013
He was happy.

509
00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.249
-Just happy
he had a place to stay.

510
00:36:55.291 --> 00:36:59.262
-I am so sorry
for what happened in London.

511
00:37:05.634 --> 00:37:07.270
I really am.

512
00:37:07.337 --> 00:37:11.508
-I thought we had a love
that was out of a novel.

513
00:37:11.574 --> 00:37:13.977
And no matter how hard
or fast or tough it was,

514
00:37:14.043 --> 00:37:16.212
we'd survive to tell the story.

515
00:37:18.048 --> 00:37:20.050
Hey.

516
00:37:20.184 --> 00:37:24.288
We do. And we can.
We can survive it.

517
00:37:28.092 --> 00:37:30.427
-I don't wanna survive.
I want to live.

518
00:37:43.942 --> 00:37:47.546
I can't keep doing this.

519
00:37:47.646 --> 00:37:50.081
-Tess.

520
00:37:50.215 --> 00:37:53.751
-You don't love me enough
to fight for me.

521
00:37:53.884 --> 00:37:56.221
You gave up every time.

522
00:38:03.762 --> 00:38:06.299
-I tried.

523
00:38:06.399 --> 00:38:08.334
I really fucking tried.

524
00:38:13.372 --> 00:38:15.341
I'm sorry I couldn't fix you.

525
00:38:19.579 --> 00:38:21.348
-Me, too.

526
00:38:27.688 --> 00:38:28.721
Me, too.

527
00:38:58.019 --> 00:39:00.221
-Who's paying for all this?

528
00:39:00.288 --> 00:39:02.408
-You don't have to worry about
money right now, honey.

529
00:39:05.661 --> 00:39:06.894
-Hey.

530
00:39:08.264 --> 00:39:10.933
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
It's okay.

531
00:39:14.103 --> 00:39:18.674
Ugh. Hey, I got make up on...
- Oh. And.

532
00:39:18.707 --> 00:39:19.707
And a little bit of snot.

533
00:39:19.774 --> 00:39:20.875
Just a little bit.

534
00:39:23.112 --> 00:39:25.415
- You ready?
- Yeah.

535
00:40:08.794 --> 00:40:11.363
-I hadn't seen my father
for nine years.

536
00:40:13.598 --> 00:40:16.468
But reconnecting with him
was one of the greatest gifts.

537
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:19.604
Even if it was only briefly.

538
00:40:23.475 --> 00:40:26.011
He had so many demons, but.

539
00:40:27.813 --> 00:40:30.483
He was also so kind.

540
00:40:34.153 --> 00:40:35.633
And he was trying
to be better for me.

541
00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:39.891
I know that.

542
00:40:57.978 --> 00:40:59.513
-You need a ride? Hardin?

543
00:41:02.182 --> 00:41:03.262
-I don't think I should go.

544
00:41:03.317 --> 00:41:05.719
-Why? You were his friend,
kind of.

545
00:41:05.853 --> 00:41:07.421
And you paid for it, so.

546
00:41:07.554 --> 00:41:10.324
-Landon, do me a favor
and keep that between us.

547
00:41:10.391 --> 00:41:12.127
-Sure. Doesn't mean
you shouldn't come.

548
00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:13.728
So, come.

549
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:49.298
-Sorry,
I didn't know that you were.

550
00:41:56.273 --> 00:41:58.608
I don't know half these people.

551
00:41:58.675 --> 00:42:00.143
It's kind of weird.

552
00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:03.814
When people go to funerals of
someone they don't even know.

553
00:42:03.947 --> 00:42:05.682
-It's just especially him.

554
00:42:05.749 --> 00:42:08.251
I mean,
they're total hypocrites.

555
00:42:08.318 --> 00:42:10.921
No one here even liked him.

556
00:42:11.021 --> 00:42:12.055
-You did.

557
00:42:14.524 --> 00:42:15.592
And even I did.

558
00:42:18.062 --> 00:42:19.964
-I'm really mad at him.

559
00:42:20.064 --> 00:42:23.534
I'm like. I'm like pissed off.

560
00:42:23.601 --> 00:42:26.204
-Hey, you have every right
to be mad at him.

561
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:28.873
Whether he's dead or not.

562
00:42:28.941 --> 00:42:33.478
I saw how much it meant to you
to have him back in your life.

563
00:42:33.544 --> 00:42:35.847
And I think he is an idiot

564
00:42:36.013 --> 00:42:38.350
for throwing that all the way
just to get high.

565
00:42:42.521 --> 00:42:44.389
But I mean, I'm one to talk,
aren't I?

566
00:42:46.558 --> 00:42:48.494
I'm so sorry
it took something like this

567
00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:51.230
for me to realize
how much you mean to me.

568
00:42:51.363 --> 00:42:55.467
And how much.
I want to be there for you.

569
00:43:04.277 --> 00:43:06.579
-I need to go back inside.

570
00:43:15.288 --> 00:43:16.656
-Okay.

571
00:43:27.902 --> 00:43:28.902
Oh, come on.

572
00:43:33.942 --> 00:43:36.377
Thank you so much
for everything.

573
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:37.510
-Yeah, of course.

574
00:43:38.646 --> 00:43:40.147
-Hey, could I have a lift?

575
00:43:40.281 --> 00:43:41.649
My ubers keep canceling.

576
00:43:41.782 --> 00:43:43.184
-I'm supposed to be meeting Nora

577
00:43:43.318 --> 00:43:45.387
and I'm already late, so.

578
00:43:45.487 --> 00:43:46.721
- Cool.
- Yeah.

579
00:43:48.723 --> 00:43:49.963
We'll see if this one turns up.

580
00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:53.895
Do you want to come with me?

581
00:43:53.996 --> 00:43:55.564
Back to Ken's.

582
00:43:55.697 --> 00:43:58.400
-I should really stay here.

583
00:43:58.533 --> 00:43:59.936
It's been a long day

584
00:44:00.068 --> 00:44:01.971
and I've got a doctor's
appointment in Seattle.

585
00:44:02.103 --> 00:44:03.606
Tomorrow.

586
00:44:03.739 --> 00:44:05.575
-Sure.

587
00:44:05.641 --> 00:44:06.809
Vance and Kimberly back?

588
00:44:06.876 --> 00:44:08.045
They get back in the morning.

589
00:44:08.244 --> 00:44:10.244
They're trying to work
everything out for the baby.

590
00:44:15.551 --> 00:44:18.354
-You know what? I'm...
I'm gonna come with you.

591
00:44:18.487 --> 00:44:20.098
I'm gonna start
looking for places up there.

592
00:44:20.122 --> 00:44:21.490
I'm ready.

593
00:44:21.557 --> 00:44:23.259
- I don't... I don't think...
- Tess. Tess,

594
00:44:23.359 --> 00:44:24.795
it's my turn
to be there for you.

595
00:44:26.496 --> 00:44:29.166
-I don't want anything
from you anymore.

596
00:44:35.105 --> 00:44:36.106
-I don't believe you.

597
00:44:38.442 --> 00:44:40.644
And I don't think
you believe yourself either.

598
00:44:58.596 --> 00:45:02.567
-I'm so sorry that we weren't
at your father's funeral.

599
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:03.835
-No, no, it's fine.

600
00:45:03.901 --> 00:45:07.706
Um, ugh. I wouldn't have been
good company anyway.

601
00:45:09.775 --> 00:45:12.544
Uh, I was actually,

602
00:45:12.611 --> 00:45:14.913
I was thinking about
moving to New York.

603
00:45:16.482 --> 00:45:17.616
With Landon.

604
00:45:19.318 --> 00:45:21.988
-New York? That...

605
00:45:22.122 --> 00:45:23.889
Wow!

606
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:25.491
What's your plan?

607
00:45:25.557 --> 00:45:27.003
Do you know where
you're gonna work, what...?

608
00:45:27.027 --> 00:45:29.562
-Not really.
I. I mean, I know it's far.

609
00:45:29.696 --> 00:45:31.865
I just think
that I need a fresh start.

610
00:45:33.833 --> 00:45:37.071
-Tessa, it's okay to be sad.

611
00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:39.272
But if you let sadness
control your life,

612
00:45:39.406 --> 00:45:41.541
you'll never have one.

613
00:45:41.608 --> 00:45:45.378
-But what if I just always
feel like this?

614
00:45:45.445 --> 00:45:47.982
-What you've been through
is awful.

615
00:45:48.115 --> 00:45:49.516
But you are so strong,

616
00:45:49.649 --> 00:45:51.252
and I know
you'll get through this.

617
00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:55.556
It just takes time.

618
00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:58.859
And as for hardin.

619
00:45:58.994 --> 00:46:01.529
Girl, just do your best
to pretend you're moving on

620
00:46:01.696 --> 00:46:04.832
and eventually,
you'll believe it.

621
00:46:15.178 --> 00:46:17.312
-Why did you stay
if you knew she wanted him?

622
00:46:19.314 --> 00:46:22.217
-I loved her.

623
00:46:22.317 --> 00:46:24.295
I thought that she would see
that he couldn't give her

624
00:46:24.319 --> 00:46:27.622
the stability that I could.

625
00:46:27.689 --> 00:46:35.398
You know, I imagine if.
If Tessa marries another man,

626
00:46:35.531 --> 00:46:38.534
this is how he's gonna feel,
competing with a memory of you.

627
00:46:38.601 --> 00:46:40.870
-I'm not Vance, okay?
Just because.

628
00:46:44.074 --> 00:46:46.642
I'm not him.

629
00:46:52.615 --> 00:46:54.752
-You are.

630
00:46:56.154 --> 00:46:57.921
Okay.

631
00:47:04.394 --> 00:47:07.031
So, it's... it's true.

632
00:47:07.132 --> 00:47:08.899
He's your father.

633
00:47:10.334 --> 00:47:14.371
I knew it. I knew it
the first time that I saw you.

634
00:47:14.438 --> 00:47:16.441
You look just like him.

635
00:47:16.574 --> 00:47:18.010
I did everything so wrong.

636
00:47:20.845 --> 00:47:22.914
And I couldn't stand
that you were his.

637
00:47:25.117 --> 00:47:27.819
That doesn't excuse
the drinking, but.

638
00:47:31.422 --> 00:47:33.291
I've loved you.

639
00:47:33.424 --> 00:47:34.859
I still love you.

640
00:47:38.397 --> 00:47:39.698
You're my son.

641
00:47:54.247 --> 00:47:55.247
I'm sorry.

642
00:48:22.577 --> 00:48:25.113
-Let's talk about
these test results.

643
00:48:25.247 --> 00:48:27.381
Unfortunately,
the chances are very slim

644
00:48:27.448 --> 00:48:30.219
that you will carry to term.

645
00:48:30.252 --> 00:48:32.920

-Tessa?

685
00:50:14.428 --> 00:50:15.828
Hey, Tess.

686
00:50:17.965 --> 00:50:19.166
- Hardin.

687
00:50:19.299 --> 00:50:20.299
-Hey, come inside.

688
00:50:22.535 --> 00:50:24.004
-I had a feeling you'd come.

689
00:50:24.071 --> 00:50:25.339
- Did you?
- Yeah.

690
00:50:27.207 --> 00:50:28.208
It's late.

691
00:50:28.308 --> 00:50:29.576
-It is.

692
00:50:35.782 --> 00:50:38.652
- Do you want a baby with me?

693
00:50:38.785 --> 00:50:40.288
-No, I don't want
a baby with you.

694
00:50:42.156 --> 00:50:43.992
-I mean.

695
00:50:44.092 --> 00:50:45.126
I just.

696
00:50:46.827 --> 00:50:48.495
I don't want a baby right now.

697
00:50:50.865 --> 00:50:52.134
-I love sleep.

698
00:50:52.201 --> 00:50:55.803
My life has the tendency
to fall apart when I'm awake.

699
00:50:55.903 --> 00:50:58.407
- Your life is
gonna be just fine, okay?

700
00:50:58.539 --> 00:51:02.077
-You said it once.
There can be no happy end to it.

701
00:51:03.945 --> 00:51:05.147
I didn't mean that.

702
00:51:06.514 --> 00:51:07.882
And I shouldn't have said it.

703
00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:12.688
-I love you enough now.

704
00:51:12.821 --> 00:51:15.091
What do you want to do?

705
00:51:15.158 --> 00:51:17.093
- I love you.
- Shush. We can quote Hemingway

706
00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.095
when we're sober, okay?

707
00:51:19.162 --> 00:51:21.464
For now, just go to sleep.

708
00:51:24.401 --> 00:51:25.901
Go to sleep.

709
00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:28.904
-Stay.

710
00:51:57.902 --> 00:51:59.137
-Morning.

711
00:51:59.237 --> 00:52:00.238
-Morning.

712
00:52:02.307 --> 00:52:08.280
Um, what did I say last night?

713
00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:13.018
You mean,
besides quoting Hemingway?

714
00:52:13.118 --> 00:52:15.754
-Oh, no, I didn't.

715
00:52:15.821 --> 00:52:16.989
-It wasn't that bad.

716
00:52:22.361 --> 00:52:23.361
Do you, uh.

717
00:52:25.164 --> 00:52:27.084
Do you want to tell me
what's been bothering you?

718
00:52:28.968 --> 00:52:30.570
-It's nothing.
It's the doctor.

719
00:52:30.702 --> 00:52:31.736
Listen.

720
00:52:33.072 --> 00:52:34.550
If you are pregnant,
I just wanted to say

721
00:52:34.574 --> 00:52:37.111
that I would genuinely
be okay with that.

722
00:52:38.312 --> 00:52:40.380
It really would not be so bad
having kids with you.

723
00:52:43.183 --> 00:52:46.487
Or, obviously, if you're...
If you're not pregnant,

724
00:52:46.587 --> 00:52:49.256
I guess maybe
after you finish college,

725
00:52:49.323 --> 00:52:51.592
or I don't know, either way.

726
00:52:55.828 --> 00:52:57.264
-I can't get pregnant.

727
00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:02.570
The. The doctor said
that it'll...

728
00:53:02.669 --> 00:53:06.074
It'd be almost impossible
for me to conceive.

729
00:53:06.207 --> 00:53:08.909
And even if I did, there'd be
a high risk of miscarriage

730
00:53:08.977 --> 00:53:10.278
so I can't.

731
00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:19.787
-Agh!

732
00:53:21.257 --> 00:53:23.058
-Uh, can you say somethin'?

733
00:53:26.694 --> 00:53:28.164
-I don't know what to say.

734
00:53:28.264 --> 00:53:29.807
-What do you... what do you mean,
you don't know what...

735
00:53:29.831 --> 00:53:30.765
You don't want kids anyway.

736
00:53:30.832 --> 00:53:33.801
-No, I-I-I didn't.

737
00:53:35.204 --> 00:53:37.739
Now, it just feels like
it's been taken away from us.

738
00:53:37.839 --> 00:53:40.342
-Uh, no, not from you.
From me.

739
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:45.248
-Wait.

740
00:53:45.348 --> 00:53:46.825
That was the wrong thing to say.
You know I didn't mean it.

741
00:53:46.849 --> 00:53:48.351
Tess, wait. Please wait.

742
00:53:49.386 --> 00:53:50.953
Tessa.

743
00:53:51.054 --> 00:53:53.156
-Please just don't
shut down on me again.

744
00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:57.294
I don't give a fuck if we can
have kids or not, honestly.

745
00:53:57.394 --> 00:53:59.405
-I'm sorry that you feel like
I took something from you.

746
00:53:59.429 --> 00:54:00.772
- I don't.
- But you're not the one

747
00:54:00.796 --> 00:54:03.034
who's just had their dreams
crushed here, you know?

748
00:54:04.701 --> 00:54:06.413
Like you didn't want kids
until two seconds ago

749
00:54:06.437 --> 00:54:08.372
which just came out of nowhere.

750
00:54:12.076 --> 00:54:13.377
-I just want to be with you.

751
00:54:14.811 --> 00:54:17.248
Kids, no kids.

752
00:54:17.348 --> 00:54:18.482
When I was in London,

753
00:54:18.583 --> 00:54:20.351
I could not stop
thinking about you.

754
00:54:22.119 --> 00:54:25.324
-Right. Yeah, I'm sure...
I'm sure you saw my face

755
00:54:25.457 --> 00:54:27.659
when you were sleeping
with that girl at the party.

756
00:54:27.758 --> 00:54:29.161
-Who are you.? What?

757
00:54:29.261 --> 00:54:32.965
Te... nothing
of the sort happened.

758
00:54:33.031 --> 00:54:34.375
And I won't lie to you.
- Shut up. You did.

759
00:54:34.399 --> 00:54:36.702
-She did... she did try
to kiss me and when she did,

760
00:54:36.834 --> 00:54:39.504
I literally threw up, so.

761
00:54:39.605 --> 00:54:42.040
-You literally threw up.

762
00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:43.242
-I did.

763
00:54:43.342 --> 00:54:45.411
- Threw up.
- I threw up.

764
00:54:45.545 --> 00:54:49.415
Instant noodles, and it went
on her head.

765
00:54:52.619 --> 00:54:53.752
-Good.

766
00:54:53.885 --> 00:54:55.288
- Good?

767
00:54:56.656 --> 00:54:57.991
- Yeah, good.
- Good.

768
00:55:11.138 --> 00:55:13.707
And that is why
hardin is afraid of gerbils.

769
00:55:16.310 --> 00:55:17.750
-If you don't stop
makin' up stories,

770
00:55:17.844 --> 00:55:19.724
I'll tell Nora about that time
you wet yourself.

771
00:55:21.148 --> 00:55:22.148
-Touché.

772
00:55:22.216 --> 00:55:23.150
-All right, then.

773
00:55:23.217 --> 00:55:25.753
-This is so good.
The sauce is amazing.

774
00:55:25.852 --> 00:55:27.763
-It's all of Landon's favorites
before he leaves us.

775
00:55:27.787 --> 00:55:30.891
-This food
almost makes me sad to go.

776
00:55:30.992 --> 00:55:34.763
-So Nora, what part of New York
are you in?

777
00:55:34.862 --> 00:55:37.198
-Um, east 14th and first ave.

778
00:55:37.265 --> 00:55:40.302
-What she actually meant was
how far is it from Landon.

779
00:55:40.402 --> 00:55:42.103
Oh. Um.

780
00:55:42.203 --> 00:55:44.472
- Like.
- Like 50 minutes by train.

781
00:55:44.572 --> 00:55:45.974
-Fifty minutes.

782
00:55:46.074 --> 00:55:47.285
I'm sorry. It's just
practically long distance.

783
00:55:47.309 --> 00:55:48.552
I don't know how
you're gonna make that work.

784
00:55:48.576 --> 00:55:50.279
-I mean,
I have to go through there

785
00:55:50.379 --> 00:55:51.747
to get to class every day.

786
00:55:51.846 --> 00:55:53.086
I mean, not... not that we'd be

787
00:55:53.182 --> 00:55:55.418
seeing each other every day.
But I mean, we could

788
00:55:55.518 --> 00:55:57.720
if you wanted too.

789
00:55:59.921 --> 00:56:01.890
-So, hardin,
graduation is looming.

790
00:56:01.991 --> 00:56:03.201
-No, we're not doing this again.
I don't want...

791
00:56:03.225 --> 00:56:04.336
-Have you given more thought
to...

792
00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:05.840
-No, I haven't
'cause I'm not going to

793
00:56:05.894 --> 00:56:07.739
walk for graduation, okay?
I don't want to walk.

794
00:56:07.763 --> 00:56:09.065
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

795
00:56:09.165 --> 00:56:10.266
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

796
00:56:10.399 --> 00:56:11.568
-Hm.

797
00:56:12.502 --> 00:56:14.037
I just thought.

798
00:56:14.137 --> 00:56:16.473
I don't know. I just thought
for sure you'd reconsider.

799
00:56:17.641 --> 00:56:19.142
-So you've obviously asked her

800
00:56:19.276 --> 00:56:21.445
to ask me?
- What? What?

801
00:56:22.746 --> 00:56:24.506
Fuck it, fine. I'll walk
for graduation then.

802
00:56:25.948 --> 00:56:27.428
- Yes!
- Don't make me change my mind.

803
00:56:28.552 --> 00:56:30.320
-To walking.

804
00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:31.321
Cheers to that.

805
00:56:31.421 --> 00:56:33.591
- To walking.
- Cheers to that.

806
00:56:33.725 --> 00:56:35.005
- To walking.
- Here we go again.

807
00:56:41.432 --> 00:56:43.568
Come on.

808
00:56:53.979 --> 00:56:57.783
-Hey, I need to talk to you
about something.

809
00:56:57.850 --> 00:56:58.984
-Okay.

810
00:57:15.033 --> 00:57:17.537
-I made a decision
about something, and I didn't.

811
00:57:19.973 --> 00:57:22.776
With everything
that's been going on

812
00:57:22.876 --> 00:57:25.044
because of a lot of things, but.

813
00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:29.115
We need time apart.

814
00:57:29.182 --> 00:57:35.388
Like. Like really apart.

815
00:57:35.488 --> 00:57:36.489
And...

816
00:57:37.491 --> 00:57:39.794
-This seems like
the only way to make sure

817
00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:42.430
that that actually happen.

818
00:57:42.563 --> 00:57:43.930
-Okay, why?

819
00:57:44.064 --> 00:57:46.933
-Because we fight
more than we get along.

820
00:57:47.034 --> 00:57:50.971
And when we make up,
it's over sex.

821
00:57:53.107 --> 00:57:55.209
-That's not...
That's not really true.

822
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:57.044
-It is, and it's not healthy.

823
00:57:57.144 --> 00:58:00.015
How is sex not healthy?

824
00:58:00.115 --> 00:58:04.052
We've been having lots of fun,
happy, consensual sex.

825
00:58:04.152 --> 00:58:07.122
And it's been full of fucking
love and fucking trust.

826
00:58:07.189 --> 00:58:10.091
-I can't keep going around
in circles like this.

827
00:58:11.893 --> 00:58:16.231
-Okay, okay.
I understand.

828
00:58:16.364 --> 00:58:18.700
And I do have a lot to work on.

829
00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:19.936
But we have so much time.

830
00:58:20.036 --> 00:58:21.737
We have all the time
in the world,

831
00:58:21.804 --> 00:58:22.804
and I will work on them.

832
00:58:22.839 --> 00:58:23.916
And I can come live with you

833
00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:26.309
in Seattle.
- Okay. Okay.

834
00:58:26.442 --> 00:58:28.778
I'm moving.

835
00:58:28.878 --> 00:58:30.680
-Okay.

836
00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:32.582
I'm moving to New York.

837
00:58:32.682 --> 00:58:34.150
I'm gonna live with Landon.

838
00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:35.551
-Landon?

839
00:58:35.651 --> 00:58:36.651
What? This was his idea?

840
00:58:36.686 --> 00:58:38.654
-No, no, no.
This was my idea.

841
00:58:38.721 --> 00:58:39.856
This wasn't. Don't...

842
00:58:39.956 --> 00:58:41.134
-He's supposed to be
my fucking brother.

843
00:58:41.158 --> 00:58:43.660
-It's not like that.
It's... no! Hey!

844
00:58:44.928 --> 00:58:45.629
- No, no.
- I'm just gonna...

845
00:58:45.696 --> 00:58:46.864
New York!

846
00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:47.974
New York!
You didn't fucking tell me!

847
00:58:47.998 --> 00:58:49.099
Well, it wasn't my call.

848
00:58:49.199 --> 00:58:50.443
You'd broken up with her.
What do you...?

849
00:58:50.467 --> 00:58:52.345
-You've been pretending
to be my fucking friend!

850
00:58:52.369 --> 00:58:54.338
-I didn't pretend shit, hardin!

851
00:58:54.438 --> 00:58:57.140
I'm her friend too, and i'm
cleaning up your shit as usual.

852
00:58:58.475 --> 00:58:59.243
Well, go ahead.

853
00:58:59.343 --> 00:59:00.644
Fucking hit me, you big man.

854
00:59:00.744 --> 00:59:02.012
Big piece of shit.

855
00:59:10.555 --> 00:59:12.657
- Fuck.

856
00:59:31.810 --> 00:59:35.180
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Tess, but.

857
00:59:36.715 --> 00:59:38.784
You know, of all people,

858
00:59:38.851 --> 00:59:42.022
he knows
how much you mean to me.

859
00:59:42.154 --> 00:59:43.255
That you're my

860
00:59:43.355 --> 00:59:44.866
fucking lifeline,
and he didn't tell me,

861
00:59:44.891 --> 00:59:46.860
and that fucking hurts.

862
00:59:46.994 --> 00:59:50.063
It fucking hurts, okay?

863
00:59:54.768 --> 00:59:56.369
I'm shit without you.

864
00:59:59.506 --> 01:00:03.643
-I'm just as good at dooming
this relationship as you.

865
01:00:03.777 --> 01:00:05.445
Is it doomed?

866
01:00:05.579 --> 01:00:07.481
Is it? I feel like
we can make this work.

867
01:00:09.216 --> 01:00:12.153
-You're trying,
and I see that. But I.

868
01:00:12.253 --> 01:00:14.155
I can't keep doing this
back and forth.

869
01:00:14.255 --> 01:00:16.992
It's... it's... it's
not just with you.

870
01:00:17.091 --> 01:00:18.292
It's with me.

871
01:00:18.359 --> 01:00:20.328
-You can't just escape yourself

872
01:00:20.394 --> 01:00:22.296
by moving from one place
to another, you know.

873
01:00:24.799 --> 01:00:26.267
You know that, right?

874
01:00:26.367 --> 01:00:31.074
-I need to figure things out.

875
01:00:31.206 --> 01:00:33.308
if you really love me...
- I do. I do.

876
01:00:33.442 --> 01:00:35.510
-Then I need you to promise
not to follow me.

877
01:00:38.246 --> 01:00:39.648
- I can't do that.
- Promise me.

878
01:00:39.781 --> 01:00:41.050
-I can't do that.

879
01:00:41.116 --> 01:00:43.151
We can make this work!
- Promise not to follow me.

880
01:00:43.251 --> 01:00:44.553
Give me some time

881
01:00:44.653 --> 01:00:48.657
or we're gonna end up
taking everyone down with us.

882
01:00:48.757 --> 01:00:49.859

883
01:00:52.862 --> 01:00:54.964

it gets too weird,

01:04:51.812 --> 01:04:53.947
They are asking

951
01:04:58.652 --> 01:05:01.955

01:05:22.011 --> 01:05:24.712
-Uh, yeah.

955
01:05:24.846 --> 01:05:27.683
I put my full name
on the job application.

956
01:05:27.816 --> 01:05:29.685
-Uh, hardin wanted to eat here.

957
01:05:29.785 --> 01:05:31.388
That's. That's.

958
01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.056
-That's fine.

959
01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:35.091
Yeah, of course.

960
01:05:35.191 --> 01:05:36.226
Let me seat you guys.

961
01:05:36.326 --> 01:05:37.994
Yeah.

962
01:05:39.229 --> 01:05:40.030
Nice to see you.

963
01:05:40.196 --> 01:05:41.097
Nice to see you, too.

964
01:05:41.131 --> 01:05:42.131
Yup.

965
01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:50.807
Sorry.

966
01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:58.548
-So, you've been here
since this morning.

967
01:05:58.682 --> 01:06:01.118
-Yeah,
I'm working a double today.

968
01:06:01.252 --> 01:06:02.686
-When will you get off?

969
01:06:03.787 --> 01:06:09.193
-Uh, one, so I should be home
around two.

970
01:06:09.327 --> 01:06:11.796
-Every single day.

971
01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:16.934
-And I'll try
not to wake you, again.

972
01:06:18.437 --> 01:06:19.904
What can I get you guys?

973
01:06:27.645 --> 01:06:28.913
Good night.

974
01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:36.822
-I just wanted to make sure
you got home okay.

975
01:06:38.024 --> 01:06:40.726
-You do know that
I walk this every night, right?

976
01:06:46.531 --> 01:06:47.966
Since you're here.

977
01:06:53.706 --> 01:06:55.775
-So why are you
working here anyway?

978
01:06:55.908 --> 01:06:58.479
Isn't Vance opening
his new publishing house?

979
01:06:58.578 --> 01:07:01.714
-Uh, I just want to do
something on my own.

980
01:07:03.283 --> 01:07:05.551
I like it. Nora's here.

981
01:07:05.685 --> 01:07:08.022
I make more money
than you'd think.

982
01:07:08.122 --> 01:07:12.326
Uh, plus it keeps me busy while
I'm waiting to get into nyu.

983
01:07:12.426 --> 01:07:14.695
-What?
You haven't gotten in yet?

984
01:07:14.795 --> 01:07:18.832
-No, but I'm hoping
for the spring semester.

985
01:07:21.469 --> 01:07:22.903
-Are you happy?

986
01:07:25.106 --> 01:07:26.573
-Yeah.

987
01:07:26.673 --> 01:07:27.975
-Are you seeing anyone?

988
01:07:28.909 --> 01:07:32.280
- Yes.
I'm out every night

989
01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:35.316
being wined and dined.

990
01:07:35.417 --> 01:07:36.694
-I'm actually not dating anyone.

991
01:07:36.718 --> 01:07:38.653
I'm quite conservative
in that way.

992
01:07:38.787 --> 01:07:40.122
- Hey, girlie.
- Hey, watch it!

993
01:07:40.189 --> 01:07:41.189
-Hey! It's okay.

994
01:07:43.192 --> 01:07:44.326
Hey, Joe.

995
01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:47.163
Uh, I brought you some fries and
the sliders that you love.

996
01:07:48.663 --> 01:07:49.999
I'll see you tomorrow.

997
01:07:54.803 --> 01:07:56.938
It makes me feel better
about my dad.

998
01:08:01.344 --> 01:08:02.711

01:08:03.779 --> 01:08:05.482

1002
01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:17.960

01:11:22.755 --> 01:11:24.315
-I do have the odd beer
or glass of wine

1050
01:11:24.423 --> 01:11:26.492
but I am never chugging
a bottle of whiskey again,

1051
01:11:26.592 --> 01:11:28.060
if that's what you mean.

1052
01:11:36.169 --> 01:11:37.803
- Mm.
- Tess.

1053
01:11:42.509 --> 01:11:43.809
Well, how is it then?

1054
01:11:45.545 --> 01:11:46.812
-Mm.

1055
01:11:48.014 --> 01:11:49.014
Oi, Tess.

1056
01:11:49.082 --> 01:11:50.550
At least share it
if you're gonna.

1057
01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:11.004
You know,
if I wasn't such a gentleman,

1058
01:12:11.105 --> 01:12:12.872
I would have you
on this counter right now.

1059
01:12:13.006 --> 01:12:15.077
-I thought
you weren't a gentleman.

1060
01:12:17.878 --> 01:12:20.215
I'm half gentleman right now.

1061
01:12:21.849 --> 01:12:23.251
-A half?

1062
01:12:23.385 --> 01:12:24.385
-Uh-huh.

1063
01:12:28.256 --> 01:12:29.658
And that means.

1064
01:12:29.758 --> 01:12:31.226
As much as I want you.

1065
01:12:34.029 --> 01:12:35.263
I can't be with you.

1066
01:12:37.966 --> 01:12:40.103
Until you're really ready
to be with me.

1067
01:12:43.606 --> 01:12:46.007
-Or. What?

1068
01:12:47.377 --> 01:12:48.417
Come on, grab some plates.

1069
01:12:48.511 --> 01:12:49.511
Let's eat.

1070
01:12:53.549 --> 01:12:56.552
-Tess, plates.
Now, please.

1071
01:13:18.676 --> 01:13:20.078
-What?

1072
01:13:22.213 --> 01:13:23.681
-Nothing.

1073
01:13:28.986 --> 01:13:30.088
-Good morning.

1074
01:13:30.221 --> 01:13:32.223
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1075
01:13:39.230 --> 01:13:40.299
Bye.

1076
01:13:50.609 --> 01:13:51.943
Finally.

1077
01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:55.681
-And it feels good.

1078
01:13:56.849 --> 01:13:59.084
-I'm gonna go take a shower.

1079
01:14:00.553 --> 01:14:01.954
-Thank you, Tess.

1080
01:14:14.134 --> 01:14:15.802
Hey.
- Hey.

1081
01:14:15.902 --> 01:14:16.770
-How's work?

1082
01:14:16.903 --> 01:14:17.903
-Good.

1083
01:14:19.906 --> 01:14:21.608
Long.

1084
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:25.513
Is, um, is Landon home?

1085
01:14:25.613 --> 01:14:27.148
-Uh, he's staying at Nora's.

1086
01:14:30.485 --> 01:14:33.054
Are you going out?

1087
01:14:33.187 --> 01:14:34.187
-No.

1088
01:14:34.222 --> 01:14:35.422
Got an early meeting tomorrow.

1089
01:14:56.178 --> 01:14:57.379
-Give me your feet.

1090
01:15:32.016 --> 01:15:33.417
-Come sit in front of me.

1091
01:16:01.513 --> 01:16:02.513
That feels good.

1092
01:16:04.516 --> 01:16:06.451
-It would feel a lot better
without this.

1093
01:16:07.819 --> 01:16:09.355
Just saying.

1094
01:16:28.107 --> 01:16:30.276
-This is your idea.

1095
01:16:30.343 --> 01:16:32.479
-I know.

1096
01:16:38.185 --> 01:16:39.653

01:17:02.877 --> 01:17:08.316

every single second
of every fucking day.

1121
01:17:52.395 --> 01:17:54.364

1150
01:19:25.927 --> 01:19:27.996
-So, by sleeping with me,
I think you just agreed

1151
01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:29.131
to start seeing me again.

1152
01:19:29.198 --> 01:19:31.466
-Mm. Is that so?

1153
01:19:31.533 --> 01:19:32.600
-Mm-hm.

1154
01:19:34.170 --> 01:19:35.904
I love this.
- What?

1155
01:19:36.004 --> 01:19:37.405
-This. Us.

1156
01:19:39.707 --> 01:19:41.743
You know we're always going to
be like this, Tess.

1157
01:19:44.847 --> 01:19:46.749
-I really have to
go to this meeting

1158
01:19:46.849 --> 01:19:49.085
so I will see you when I'm back.
- Okay.

1159
01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:52.955
Okay.

1160
01:20:12.210 --> 01:20:14.178
<i>It was the fall when he met her.</i>

1161
01:20:14.212 --> 01:20:17.215
<i>In his world, he was only
concerned about one thing.</i>

1162
01:20:17.248 --> 01:20:19.116
<i>Himself.</i>

1163
01:20:19.150 --> 01:20:20.951
<i>He'd won every bet so far,</i>

1164
01:20:20.984 --> 01:20:23.087
<i>and this was
supposed to be no different,</i>

1165
01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.721
<i>although in Tessa's nearness,</i>

1166
01:20:24.754 --> 01:20:27.892
<i>he felt an apprehension
this time.</i>

1167
01:20:27.925 --> 01:20:31.063
<i>In a Darcy-inspired gesture,
he funded her father's funeral.</i>

1168
01:20:32.663 --> 01:20:34.903
<i>It was only the beginning of
what he felt he needed to do</i>

1169
01:20:34.932 --> 01:20:37.568
<i>to absolve himself.</i>

1170
01:20:37.602 --> 01:20:39.971
<i>His guilt led heavy in the call
that he hadn't answered.</i>

1171
01:20:42.341 --> 01:20:43.784
<i>The only reason he didn't
lose himself</i>

1172
01:20:43.808 --> 01:20:44.909
<i>again in darkness.</i>

1173
01:20:44.942 --> 01:20:47.346
<i>.Was in knowing
her dad was happy.</i>

1174
01:20:47.378 --> 01:20:49.082
<i>His death
was surely an accident.</i>

1175
01:20:49.115 --> 01:20:51.583
<i>It didn't bring him back,
but his talk of his future</i>

1176
01:20:51.617 --> 01:20:53.518
<i>and appreciating
the time off the street.</i>

1177
01:20:54.686 --> 01:20:56.989
<i>Though she was unable to
bear children of her own,</i>

1178
01:20:57.022 --> 01:20:59.458
<i>she couldn't let go
of the dream of them.</i>

1179
01:20:59.491 --> 01:21:02.228
<i>He knew that,
and loved her even so.</i>

1180
01:21:02.262 --> 01:21:03.929
<i>He tried not to be selfish.</i>

1181
01:21:03.962 --> 01:21:06.366
<i>But he couldn't help</i>
<i>thinking about the little</i>
<i>versions of him</i>

1182
01:21:06.398 --> 01:21:07.599
<i>she couldn't give him.</i>

1183
01:21:09.002 --> 01:21:11.771
<i>He hopes she will understand
just how broken he was</i>

1184
01:21:11.804 --> 01:21:13.973
<i>and see how much
she affected his life.</i>

1185
01:21:24.351 --> 01:21:25.618
-"She stumbled

1186
01:21:25.752 --> 01:21:28.088
"through the room the way
that tasteless girls move

1187
01:21:28.188 --> 01:21:29.889
when they drink too much."

1188
01:21:29.956 --> 01:21:31.293
-Stop reading that.

1189
01:21:31.425 --> 01:21:34.129
-No, no, no,
you don't get to write my story

1190
01:21:34.262 --> 01:21:35.729
and then tell me
I can't read it.

1191
01:21:35.796 --> 01:21:36.931
-That part's not about you.

1192
01:21:36.997 --> 01:21:40.035
-How long have you been
writing about us?

1193
01:21:44.972 --> 01:21:46.473
-After we kissed.

1194
01:21:46.573 --> 01:21:48.176
-You. Like the first time?

1195
01:21:51.645 --> 01:21:53.149
Are you fucking kidding me?

1196
01:21:54.883 --> 01:21:56.017
You're just.

1197
01:21:57.519 --> 01:21:58.553
Tess, I'll explain

1198
01:21:58.687 --> 01:21:59.730
if you'll just listen.
- Oh, no.

1199
01:21:59.754 --> 01:22:02.291
You already have, on every page.

1200
01:22:02.425 --> 01:22:04.025
- This is what I did to vent.
- Great.

1201
01:22:04.093 --> 01:22:05.094
-Where are you going?

1202
01:22:05.194 --> 01:22:06.828
- I.
- Tess!

1203
01:22:06.928 --> 01:22:09.698
-I'm done. This. We're just a
bomb waiting to explode.

1204
01:22:09.764 --> 01:22:11.310
This was a wake-up call.
- What do you mean?

1205
01:22:11.334 --> 01:22:12.476
You're acting like I wrote that

1206
01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:13.612
to purposely hurt you.
- How...

1207
01:22:13.636 --> 01:22:15.138
How did you think
I was gonna feel?

1208
01:22:15.272 --> 01:22:16.772
-It was not all about you.

1209
01:22:16.839 --> 01:22:19.742
-You would never let me read
what you were writing in there.

1210
01:22:19.809 --> 01:22:21.278
And now the whole world gets to.

1211
01:22:21.345 --> 01:22:23.080
Stuff about me.

1212
01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:24.613
Stuff about my dad.

1213
01:22:25.648 --> 01:22:28.651
-I'm sorry. I never meant
for it to be published.

1214
01:22:28.718 --> 01:22:31.188
I started that journal to
figure the shit out in my head.

1215
01:22:31.254 --> 01:22:33.689
They asked me to read it
in group therapy, so I did.

1216
01:22:33.756 --> 01:22:36.427
And one thing
just led to another.

1217
01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:39.364
-You accidentally wrote a book.

1218
01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:41.099
-I.

1219
01:22:41.165 --> 01:22:43.500
I didn't mean
for this to happen this way.

1220
01:22:45.602 --> 01:22:49.240
-No one
wants to read this sick shit.

1221
01:22:49.307 --> 01:22:50.941
I thought that too.

1222
01:22:51.075 --> 01:22:54.245
But there's a bidding war
for my book.

1223
01:22:56.181 --> 01:22:57.648
And that's why I'm in town.

1224
01:23:00.818 --> 01:23:02.121
-You accidentally wrote a book

1225
01:23:02.187 --> 01:23:04.889
and then you shopped it
around to publishers

1226
01:23:05.023 --> 01:23:07.025
without asking me?

1227
01:23:07.159 --> 01:23:09.495
-Fuck, this never
should have happened like this.

1228
01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:11.562
-No, no. It shouldn't have.

1229
01:23:11.662 --> 01:23:13.965
-Tess, I hated myself.

1230
01:23:14.066 --> 01:23:16.734
I had to deal with that
every fucking day.

1231
01:23:16.801 --> 01:23:19.638
What is the point in everything
we've been through if we can't

1232
01:23:19.772 --> 01:23:21.940
channel that into something
that helps people?

1233
01:23:22.007 --> 01:23:25.010
-I don't want people reading
about my life and judging me.

1234
01:23:25.111 --> 01:23:27.347
-It's not your life, Tess.
It's our lives,

1235
01:23:27.447 --> 01:23:29.149
and it's a story
about forgiveness

1236
01:23:29.282 --> 01:23:31.317
and unconditional love.

1237
01:23:32.985 --> 01:23:35.754
It doesn't matter about
parents or addiction

1238
01:23:35.888 --> 01:23:38.690
or whatever fucked up past.
It's never too late.

1239
01:23:38.825 --> 01:23:40.361
People can always change.

1240
01:23:40.428 --> 01:23:42.695
That is the kind of story
"after" is.

1241
01:23:44.365 --> 01:23:45.698
- "After"?

1242
01:23:46.733 --> 01:23:49.070
-It's my journey
after I met you.

1243
01:23:50.937 --> 01:23:52.705
-I think that journey is over.

-I didn't think
I'd ever come here.

1256
01:24:48.565 --> 01:24:51.268
I really thought
that I had hit rock bottom

1257
01:24:51.401 --> 01:24:53.736
and then I'd hit it again harder
and again and again,

1258
01:24:53.870 --> 01:24:56.206
and I burnt down
a fucking house.

1259
01:24:59.008 --> 01:25:01.978
And, uh, I guess... I guess
what I'm trying to say is

1260
01:25:02.045 --> 01:25:03.147
thank you all.

1261
01:25:04.549 --> 01:25:06.984
Because
when I walked in that door,

1262
01:25:07.118 --> 01:25:08.852
I. I didn't know
how this would go.

1263
01:25:08.986 --> 01:25:10.131
I didn't think
it would work for me.

1264
01:25:10.155 --> 01:25:11.322
I never open up.

1265
01:25:11.456 --> 01:25:14.691
And somehow, you guys
have found a way to make me,

1266
01:25:14.825 --> 01:25:17.027
and I'm grateful.

1267
01:25:17.162 --> 01:25:19.230
I mean this...
This really helped a lot.

1268
01:25:19.297 --> 01:25:21.332
I'd recommend it to anyone.

1269
01:25:21.399 --> 01:25:25.803
I feel like I'm actually
a better version of myself

1270
01:25:25.937 --> 01:25:31.277
and I haven't tried to
better myself ever, really.

1271
01:25:33.778 --> 01:25:35.281
So thank you.

It's been so nice
having you back in London.

1283
01:26:24.398 --> 01:26:25.600
Mm.

1284
01:26:25.666 --> 01:26:27.368
I have something for you.

1285
01:26:30.439 --> 01:26:32.541
Look at this.

1286
01:26:33.774 --> 01:26:36.278
Your name.

1287
01:26:36.411 --> 01:26:38.480
I'm so proud of you.

1288
01:26:47.822 --> 01:26:48.889
I'm so sorry.

1289
01:26:49.091 --> 01:26:52.295
-Mum, it's fine.
I've been going through so much.

1290
01:26:52.328 --> 01:26:53.996
-No, but.

1291
01:26:54.063 --> 01:26:56.199
I didn't know what to do.

1292
01:26:56.266 --> 01:26:57.899
I was young, I was.

1293
01:26:59.868 --> 01:27:01.504
In love and I was terrified.

1294
01:27:03.005 --> 01:27:04.707
None of that excuses the fact

1295
01:27:04.773 --> 01:27:07.143
that I hid the truth from you
for so long.

1296
01:27:07.277 --> 01:27:08.277
But.

1297
01:27:10.747 --> 01:27:13.217
Everything I did,
every decision I made,

1298
01:27:13.284 --> 01:27:16.287
no matter how regrettable
looking back, it was.

1299
01:27:18.921 --> 01:27:20.957
It was done out of love for you.

1300
01:27:23.394 --> 01:27:24.395
-I know it was, mum.

1301
01:27:25.663 --> 01:27:27.231
And thank you for saying that.

1302
01:27:31.068 --> 01:27:32.202
It's good, all right?

1303
01:27:32.269 --> 01:27:33.936
-This is amazing.

1304
01:27:36.541 --> 01:27:38.710
Checkout took forever.

1305
01:27:38.777 --> 01:27:42.414
Yes. Yes. No,
I'm on my way back now.

1306
01:27:56.329 --> 01:27:59.498
Sorry, yeah.

1307
01:27:59.565 --> 01:28:00.965
Yeah, I'll see you soon.

1308
01:28:04.869 --> 01:28:08.641
Hi. Look at you, so official.

1309
01:28:08.741 --> 01:28:13.579
-Hi. You have to tell me
everything.

1310
01:28:13.679 --> 01:28:14.979
-Hasn't been that long.

1311
01:28:17.751 --> 01:28:18.827
-I think it's just since Landon

1312
01:28:18.851 --> 01:28:22.122
basically moved in
with Nora that.

1313
01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:23.790
-You're starved for attention.

1314
01:28:23.889 --> 01:28:25.525
-Mm. I thought
it would be easier

1315
01:28:25.659 --> 01:28:27.993
making friends at school.

1316
01:28:28.128 --> 01:28:31.398
-Yeah. The campus
is pretty spread out, huh?

1317
01:28:31.498 --> 01:28:33.109
-Yeah. And it's just
by the time you figure out

1318
01:28:33.133 --> 01:28:34.453
where to meet
and how to get there

1319
01:28:34.568 --> 01:28:35.769
on the subway and the buses,

1320
01:28:35.901 --> 01:28:37.771
it's like an hour
to do anything.

1321
01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:39.107
-Welcome to New York.

1322
01:28:39.207 --> 01:28:41.975
- So I hope
you like chicken Alfredo.

1323
01:28:43.845 --> 01:28:44.846
- Er.
- What?

1324
01:28:44.945 --> 01:28:46.123
-I should've mentioned this.
I'm...

1325
01:28:46.147 --> 01:28:47.624
I'm actually doing
the plant-based thing.

1326
01:28:47.648 --> 01:28:48.792
-I don't know why I didn't ask.

1327
01:28:48.816 --> 01:28:49.816
I should have just asked.

1328
01:28:49.883 --> 01:28:50.893
-No, no.
You know, let's improvise.

1329
01:28:50.917 --> 01:28:52.018
You got any red sauce?

1330
01:28:56.724 --> 01:28:58.259
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

1331
01:28:58.359 --> 01:29:00.027
Tessa. Tess. Hey.
- I'm sorry.

1332
01:29:01.730 --> 01:29:03.365
-Don't worry about it.

1333
01:29:03.432 --> 01:29:04.500
I'll order somethin' in.

1334
01:29:04.566 --> 01:29:07.736
Mm.

1335
01:29:07.836 --> 01:29:08.871
-You wanna try?

1336
01:29:08.970 --> 01:29:10.372
-What is it?

1337
01:29:10.506 --> 01:29:11.939
-Tofu curry dumpling.

1338
01:29:12.039 --> 01:29:13.308
Is it spicy?

1339
01:29:13.409 --> 01:29:14.743
-Not... not. Just try it.

1340
01:29:14.843 --> 01:29:15.977
-Okay.

1341
01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:23.051
- Yeah?
- Mm.

1342
01:29:24.621 --> 01:29:26.723
It's not... it's not bad.

1343
01:29:26.823 --> 01:29:27.590
-But.?

1344
01:29:27.724 --> 01:29:28.924
- It's not good.

1345
01:29:29.024 --> 01:29:30.794
Oh, come on.

1346
01:29:30.894 --> 01:29:32.662
So one of my classmates
invited us

1347
01:29:32.729 --> 01:29:34.798
to his girlfriend's
gallery opening

1348
01:29:34.864 --> 01:29:36.499
in the village tonight.
- Mm-hm.

1349
01:29:36.566 --> 01:29:38.735
-Do you wanna go?

1350
01:29:38.868 --> 01:29:43.140
-Um, yeah.
I mean, I'd love to but.

1351
01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:45.109
I've actually got this thing
tonight.

1352
01:29:45.209 --> 01:29:46.510
Can we do it another time?

1353
01:29:46.610 --> 01:29:49.413
-Yeah. Of course.

1354
01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:51.415
-Okay.

1355
01:29:55.319 --> 01:29:58.122
So after she kicked me out,

1356
01:29:58.222 --> 01:29:59.824
I really felt
that my entire world

1357
01:29:59.924 --> 01:30:01.991
was just crumbling around me.

1358
01:30:02.059 --> 01:30:03.461
I was afraid
I was going to spiral.

1359
01:30:04.962 --> 01:30:06.631
I really had
nothing going for me.

1360
01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:09.700
But then I got the call.

1361
01:30:11.303 --> 01:30:15.240
Dowless and sons wanted the book
to release immediately.

1362
01:30:15.373 --> 01:30:18.944
So, I picked up the phone
and I called.

1363
01:30:19.043 --> 01:30:20.212
I called my therapist.

1364
01:30:23.047 --> 01:30:24.115
And I took a breath.

1365
01:30:26.219 --> 01:30:27.620
And I took the deal.

1366
01:30:29.355 --> 01:30:30.490
And here we are.

1367
01:30:47.908 --> 01:30:50.244
Anyway, I'll, uh,
I'll stop blithering on,

1368
01:30:50.344 --> 01:30:52.246
and I'll actually
read something.
