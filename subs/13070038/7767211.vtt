1
00:00:55.996 --> 00:00:57.872
All of us have demons.

2
00:00:57.914 --> 00:01:00.166
All I want is a relationship
with my daughter.

3
00:01:00.208 --> 00:01:02.877
He's an alcoholic
and so were you.

4
00:01:04.546 --> 00:01:06.297
You face them.

5
00:01:06.338 --> 00:01:08.841
And just when you think
you're winning,

6
00:01:08.883 --> 00:01:10.551
it turns out.

7
00:01:10.592 --> 00:01:13.220
They weren't your demons
to begin with.

8
00:01:13.262 --> 00:01:14.805
What the fuck?

9
00:01:14.846 --> 00:01:16.390
Oh, fu...

10
00:01:16.432 --> 00:01:17.391
Vance!

11
00:01:17.433 --> 00:01:18.642
It's not what you think.

12
00:01:18.684 --> 00:01:20.227
You're getting married tomorrow!

13
00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:22.729
I was gonna tell you ages ago,
but your mom didn't want.

14
00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:23.855
Tell me what?

15
00:01:23.897 --> 00:01:26.775
Hardin is Christian's son.

16
00:01:27.818 --> 00:01:29.027
- I'm so sorry.
- Fuck off!

17
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:00.682
Hardin.

18
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.727
It was. It was a mistake.

19
00:02:03.768 --> 00:02:05.019
Which part?

20
00:02:11.275 --> 00:02:12.693
Christian told you?

21
00:02:18.324 --> 00:02:19.700
My love, if I could go back.

22
00:02:19.742 --> 00:02:21.660
If I could go back, if...

23
00:02:22.953 --> 00:02:24.454
I should have told you.

24
00:02:26.624 --> 00:02:27.833
Yeah.

25
00:02:30.585 --> 00:02:32.337
Hardin!

26
00:02:46.225 --> 00:02:47.977
Kimberly, look.

27
00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.480
Ooh, yeah.

28
00:02:53.857 --> 00:02:55.234
- Hi.
- Hey.

29
00:03:09.705 --> 00:03:10.999
You sure you wanna do that?

30
00:03:14.585 --> 00:03:16.296
I'll get one of those.

31
00:03:24.428 --> 00:03:25.680
Your dad.

32
00:03:27.597 --> 00:03:28.808
Ken.

33
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.562
You know, we were like brothers.

34
00:03:33.603 --> 00:03:35.230
And then you fucked his wife.

35
00:03:35.272 --> 00:03:36.648
That's not how it was.

36
00:03:38.232 --> 00:03:40.527
I loved your mum.

37
00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.153
She was head over heels
with him.

38
00:03:43.947 --> 00:03:47.867
But then when he went to
university, he wasn't there.

39
00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:49.827
He was wandering around.
He was always busy.

40
00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:54.873
And. She turned to me
for emotional support.

41
00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.169
That's how it became intimate.

42
00:03:59.211 --> 00:04:01.505
Spare me
the fucking details, okay?

43
00:04:03.006 --> 00:04:06.719
I had this ridiculous notion
that we'd run off together and.

44
00:04:08.511 --> 00:04:12.515
She'd marry me instead of Ken.

45
00:04:12.557 --> 00:04:15.268
Then they announced
they were expecting.

46
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.062
And that was that.

47
00:04:21.315 --> 00:04:22.817
This is just brilliant.

48
00:04:25.277 --> 00:04:28.739
And Mum, Ken and you lying to me
my entire fucking life.

49
00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:31.950
Ken didn't know.

50
00:04:36.037 --> 00:04:38.374
I think deep down
he's always suspected her.

51
00:04:40.375 --> 00:04:42.628
That was when
he really started drinking.

52
00:04:44.796 --> 00:04:47.007
You could have
stopped all of it.

53
00:04:47.048 --> 00:04:49.175
My entire fucking life
could have been different

54
00:04:49.217 --> 00:04:51.344
if you weren't
such a fucking coward.

55
00:04:59.143 --> 00:05:04.356
Smith, you can
go dance with them. Go on.

56
00:05:04.398 --> 00:05:06.608
Does he know
that Hardin is his brother?

57
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.288
Where's Hardin?

58
00:05:20.329 --> 00:05:21.998
I don't know. He bolted.

59
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.124
What?

60
00:05:23.166 --> 00:05:24.709
Maybe he needed some space.

61
00:05:25.877 --> 00:05:27.295
Wait, Tessa.

62
00:06:10.252 --> 00:06:11.962
Christian, you should see him.

63
00:06:12.003 --> 00:06:13.964
He's growing up so fast.

64
00:06:14.005 --> 00:06:17.426
He's a little man now.

65
00:06:17.468 --> 00:06:18.844
And so talented.

66
00:06:18.885 --> 00:06:21.512
His essay got chosen
to run in a paper.

67
00:06:21.554 --> 00:06:23.223
Well done, Hardin.

68
00:06:23.264 --> 00:06:25.141
Can you tell him I said that?

69
00:06:25.183 --> 00:06:26.392
He's brilliant.

70
00:06:27.602 --> 00:06:29.312
He's like his father.

71
00:06:29.354 --> 00:06:32.607
Look, I gotta get going.
Um, let's talk again soon.

72
00:06:32.648 --> 00:06:33.774
Yeah. Of course.

73
00:06:33.816 --> 00:06:34.900
Bye, Christian.

74
00:06:36.736 --> 00:06:38.278
Hey, keep it down.

75
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:44.659
Ken!

76
00:06:45.577 --> 00:06:48.122
Hardin, who gave this to you?

77
00:06:48.163 --> 00:06:49.373
Vance.

78
00:06:55.462 --> 00:06:57.130
- Ken! Ken!
- Stop! You're ruining it!

79
00:06:57.171 --> 00:06:58.256
Hardin!

80
00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:03.803
I'm so sorry.

81
00:07:03.845 --> 00:07:05.179
Hardin?

82
00:07:12.353 --> 00:07:13.646
I've been looking for you.

83
00:07:16.774 --> 00:07:18.066
Wanna drink?

84
00:07:18.108 --> 00:07:19.818
No.

85
00:07:23.989 --> 00:07:25.615
Come on,
let's go back to the hotel.

86
00:07:25.657 --> 00:07:28.076
Not yet.

87
00:07:28.118 --> 00:07:29.994
Okay. Please, Hardin,

88
00:07:30.036 --> 00:07:32.664
I'm really cold and tired.
And I just wanna go back...

89
00:07:32.705 --> 00:07:34.016
Tessa, you're not the one
who just found out

90
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.333
his entire life was a lie.

91
00:07:35.375 --> 00:07:37.794
So, either
have a drink with me or go.

92
00:07:43.883 --> 00:07:45.509
Okay.
I'm gonna get us an Uber.

93
00:07:51.557 --> 00:07:52.891
You know, I'm pretty sure

94
00:07:52.933 --> 00:07:55.394
that she would have
locked it before she left.

95
00:07:57.437 --> 00:07:58.564
Hey!

96
00:08:12.493 --> 00:08:14.329
Hardin, please.
I know you're upset,

97
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:16.010
and I know you're angry.
And you should...

98
00:08:16.038 --> 00:08:17.331
You know, I hear her screams

99
00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:19.291
every single time
I walk in this place.

100
00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:20.292
Okay, we need to leave.

101
00:08:20.334 --> 00:08:21.877
Years I've spent hating a man

102
00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:24.171
who as it turns out, I didn't
even need to fucking like!

103
00:08:24.213 --> 00:08:25.630
Don't touch me.

104
00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:27.108
What's the plan?
What are you gonna do here?

105
00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:28.443
Are you gonna burn
your mother's house down?

106
00:08:28.467 --> 00:08:29.944
I'm gonna burn
the fucking place down, yeah.

107
00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:31.070
So, you're gonna get arrested,
you know that? Right?

108
00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:32.471
Which is why you should leave.

109
00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:35.264
No! I'm not...
I'm not going without you.

110
00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:37.058
Tess.

111
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.285
"If two people love each other,

112
00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:39.536
there can be
no happy end to it."

113
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.312
Don't quote Hemingway at me.

114
00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:42.414
Why are you always
trying to find

115
00:08:42.438 --> 00:08:43.707
some sort of light in me, Tessa?

116
00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:45.649
Wake up.
There is no fucking light.

117
00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:47.360
I have fucked up parents,

118
00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:48.545
fucked up past.
Look at my parents!

119
00:08:48.569 --> 00:08:49.754
So, I have a fucked up head
now!

120
00:08:49.778 --> 00:08:51.239
My Dad's homeless,
for God's sake.

121
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.073
It's not a fucking competition!

122
00:09:03.917 --> 00:09:05.318
Hardin, please,
give me the lighter.

123
00:09:10.715 --> 00:09:12.837
Please, Hardin, can you think
about what you're doing?

124
00:09:32.569 --> 00:09:33.612
Hardin?

125
00:09:33.654 --> 00:09:34.613
Oh, my God.

126
00:09:34.655 --> 00:09:35.840
Hardin, we gotta get out here.

127
00:09:35.864 --> 00:09:37.115
Get the fuck off me!

128
00:09:37.157 --> 00:09:38.408
We need to go!

129
00:09:38.449 --> 00:09:40.201
All right, Tessa,
you take my car.

130
00:09:40.243 --> 00:09:41.870
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. I've got him.

131
00:09:41.912 --> 00:09:43.680
Come on, man, we need to go.
Now, you wanna play hero?

132
00:09:43.704 --> 00:09:45.290
Where were you?

133
00:09:45.331 --> 00:09:46.892
Where were you
when she was being beaten

134
00:09:46.916 --> 00:09:48.168
to a bloody fucking pulp?

135
00:09:48.209 --> 00:09:49.544
Fuck away from me!

136
00:09:50.628 --> 00:09:52.838
You're too late!

137
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.089
I'm sorry, all right?

138
00:09:54.131 --> 00:09:56.717
- I don't care.
- I'm sorry! Come here.

139
00:09:56.759 --> 00:09:59.678
I am sorry.
I should have been here for her.

140
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.430
Listen to me!

141
00:10:01.471 --> 00:10:03.598
I should have been here.

142
00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.435
But you ruining your life
isn't gonna make hers better.

143
00:10:10.397 --> 00:10:11.815
We need to go!

144
00:10:11.856 --> 00:10:13.858
Come on!
Get out, now!

145
00:10:18.612 --> 00:10:19.823
Go, go!

146
00:10:23.242 --> 00:10:24.368
Go.

147
00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:48.099
Dispatches unit.

148
00:11:22.298 --> 00:11:23.508
Where are we?

149
00:11:23.549 --> 00:11:25.343
I don't know where.
I just kept driving.

150
00:11:27.011 --> 00:11:28.304
Where's Vance? Is he.?

151
00:11:28.346 --> 00:11:29.972
I texted him. He's okay.

152
00:11:30.014 --> 00:11:32.558
But, um.

153
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.603
He told the police
that he started the fire.

154
00:11:38.272 --> 00:11:39.523
He's got lawyers.

155
00:11:41.775 --> 00:11:42.961
And that's not
gonna change anything.

156
00:11:42.985 --> 00:11:45.529
He still lied to me
for 21 years.

157
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.947
He's your father.

158
00:11:47.989 --> 00:11:49.198
As of yesterday.

159
00:11:51.743 --> 00:11:53.036
We should get back.

160
00:12:20.353 --> 00:12:21.563
Thank you.

161
00:12:22.564 --> 00:12:23.940
Please.

162
00:12:23.981 --> 00:12:27.235
Just let me try to
explain myself.

163
00:12:27.277 --> 00:12:29.028
No.

164
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:30.613
Not right now anyways.

165
00:12:39.496 --> 00:12:40.706
Pull over.

166
00:13:09.316 --> 00:13:12.903
I think I should
stay here for a while.

167
00:13:12.945 --> 00:13:14.154
Why?

168
00:13:23.955 --> 00:13:25.165
Because.

169
00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.587
Because I just keep dragging you
into my shit, Tessa.

170
00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:32.171
It's not fair.

171
00:13:34.465 --> 00:13:36.217
Please don't push me away.

172
00:13:44.099 --> 00:13:45.309
I love you.

173
00:14:03.326 --> 00:14:04.536
Tess.

174
00:14:22.178 --> 00:14:23.387
Touch me.

175
00:15:05.552 --> 00:15:06.761
I love you.

176
00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:12.100
I love you.

177
00:15:53.765 --> 00:15:55.057
What are you thinking about?

178
00:15:59.436 --> 00:16:01.605
I wanna stay
like this forever.

179
00:16:29.256 --> 00:16:31.633
I'll get the bags.

180
00:16:31.676 --> 00:16:34.678
Go check on Kimberly,
take a shower.

181
00:16:34.719 --> 00:16:36.055
I'll be fine.

182
00:16:56.282 --> 00:16:57.616
Kimberly, Tessa's here.

183
00:16:59.827 --> 00:17:01.745
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

184
00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:03.038
Where's Hardin?

185
00:17:06.625 --> 00:17:09.878
I could feel him withdrawing
with every breath.

186
00:17:14.257 --> 00:17:16.093
I'm-I'm sorry.

187
00:17:16.134 --> 00:17:17.153
I don't want to
bother you with this.

188
00:17:17.177 --> 00:17:18.362
You're already going through...

189
00:17:18.386 --> 00:17:22.139
No. Tessa,
there is no rule that says

190
00:17:22.181 --> 00:17:25.435
only one person
can be in pain at a time.

191
00:17:25.477 --> 00:17:28.187
And for selfish reasons,
hearing about your problems

192
00:17:28.229 --> 00:17:30.815
makes me feel slightly
better about my own.

193
00:17:32.524 --> 00:17:33.734
Talk to me.

194
00:17:34.568 --> 00:17:36.112
I feel like I'm drowning.

195
00:17:39.323 --> 00:17:41.700
And I want to make it work,
but I just.

196
00:17:43.702 --> 00:17:46.497
I don't know
if I can keep fighting

197
00:17:46.538 --> 00:17:49.499
against the current to save him
rather than myself.

198
00:17:53.419 --> 00:17:54.629
Yeah.

199
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:02.845
Concierge brought this up.

200
00:18:17.734 --> 00:18:20.404
Shit.

201
00:18:56.646 --> 00:18:58.190
Fuck off.

202
00:18:59.899 --> 00:19:01.484
Long time, man.

203
00:19:01.526 --> 00:19:03.277
Long time.

204
00:19:03.319 --> 00:19:05.237
James, look who's here.

205
00:19:05.279 --> 00:19:08.950
Oh, shit! Awoo!

206
00:19:08.991 --> 00:19:10.593
You look just like a guy
I used to party with.

207
00:19:10.617 --> 00:19:12.744
Yeah, you look like
a guy who was high 24/7.

208
00:19:12.786 --> 00:19:13.996
I am he.

209
00:19:14.038 --> 00:19:15.664
Yo, get comfy.

210
00:19:15.706 --> 00:19:18.625
I'm just gonna make a few calls
in honor of our guest.

211
00:19:18.667 --> 00:19:20.586
Okay, come on.

212
00:19:20.627 --> 00:19:21.920
Hey, sit down, man. Sit.

213
00:19:21.962 --> 00:19:23.797
Look at you, bougie as fuck.

214
00:19:23.839 --> 00:19:26.466
You still look like shit.

215
00:19:26.507 --> 00:19:27.787
What've you got?
A job interview?

216
00:19:29.177 --> 00:19:31.429
Still funny as fuck, huh, James.

217
00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:32.472
Hey, you want to drink?

218
00:19:32.513 --> 00:19:33.931
I would love a drink.

219
00:19:35.808 --> 00:19:37.727
Tessa.

220
00:19:40.438 --> 00:19:41.731
You okay?

221
00:19:45.275 --> 00:19:46.485
Great.

222
00:19:57.162 --> 00:19:58.663
I'm gonna go get him.

223
00:20:04.168 --> 00:20:05.461
Thanks.

224
00:20:23.353 --> 00:20:25.105
Hello.

225
00:20:25.147 --> 00:20:26.732
Hi. Is Hardin there?

226
00:20:26.774 --> 00:20:30.068
Uh, Scott is
disposed at the moment.

227
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.945
Uh, are you gonna
come to the party?

228
00:20:31.987 --> 00:20:36.073
Um. Yeah, I just need
the address again.

229
00:20:36.116 --> 00:20:37.575
It's 52, Warwick Street.

230
00:20:37.617 --> 00:20:38.743
Ask her if she's hot.

231
00:20:38.785 --> 00:20:40.620
Uh, my friend's asking
if you're hot.

232
00:20:40.662 --> 00:20:42.413
We're running out of
ten-out-of-tens here.

233
00:20:42.455 --> 00:20:43.974
- Ask her if she has friends.
- Yeah well, she hung up.

234
00:20:43.998 --> 00:20:45.249
Hey.

235
00:20:45.291 --> 00:20:46.417
Give that to Hardin, man.

236
00:20:46.458 --> 00:20:47.752
Now, come on. Drink up.

237
00:21:17.572 --> 00:21:19.031
Hey! Have a shot.

238
00:21:19.073 --> 00:21:20.825
Come on in, come on in.

239
00:21:20.866 --> 00:21:22.076
Thanks.

240
00:21:23.869 --> 00:21:26.580
Whoa. American.

241
00:21:29.458 --> 00:21:30.792
I'm Mark. This is my flat.

242
00:21:31.751 --> 00:21:32.961
I'm Tessa.

243
00:21:35.797 --> 00:21:38.467
C'mon, love.
Let's get you a drink.

244
00:21:46.599 --> 00:21:48.101
Hey, Scott.

245
00:21:48.142 --> 00:21:49.560
Yo, give me that damn vodka.

246
00:21:49.602 --> 00:21:51.770
Need to make
my new friend here a drink.

247
00:21:51.812 --> 00:21:53.231
Tessa, what?...?

248
00:21:55.358 --> 00:21:56.650
Oh, you two knew each other?

249
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.141
Yeah. I'm gonna
take that as a yes.

250
00:22:10.372 --> 00:22:12.415
- Fucking hell! Jesus Christ!
- What the fuck?

251
00:22:12.457 --> 00:22:14.059
What? You're the only one
who gets to break things?

252
00:22:14.083 --> 00:22:15.478
You didn't tell me
you had a girlfriend.

253
00:22:15.502 --> 00:22:17.337
What the hell is wrong with you?

254
00:22:17.379 --> 00:22:18.856
What? Do you think you're
just gonna slum it here

255
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.940
and you'll forget
about your problem?

256
00:22:19.964 --> 00:22:21.508
Why the fuck
are you even here?

257
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:23.791
I'm not letting you get away
with being a coward again.

258
00:22:26.303 --> 00:22:27.948
I'm giving you one chance
to leave with me.

259
00:22:27.972 --> 00:22:30.099
But if I walk out the door
without you, that's it.

260
00:22:39.232 --> 00:22:40.942
So, um, if she isn't
your girlfriend.

261
00:22:43.987 --> 00:22:44.946
Just get the fuck away!

262
00:22:44.988 --> 00:22:46.114
Tessa, outside, now.

263
00:22:48.116 --> 00:22:49.575
We're just playing about,
Scott.

264
00:22:53.663 --> 00:22:54.872
Tess, what the fuck?

265
00:22:54.914 --> 00:22:57.041
This is bullshit, Hardin.
This isn't us.

266
00:22:57.082 --> 00:23:00.377
Us? What "us", Tess?
There is no us.

267
00:23:00.419 --> 00:23:02.672
We. We keep going round
in circles, and you,

268
00:23:02.713 --> 00:23:04.131
you just won't fucking give up.

269
00:23:05.132 --> 00:23:07.968
God! What more do you need?

270
00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:09.303
You don't belong here.

271
00:23:09.344 --> 00:23:11.346
You shouldn't be here.
You don't fit in here!

272
00:23:11.388 --> 00:23:12.806
So just go!

273
00:23:15.684 --> 00:23:17.101
You win, Hardin.

274
00:23:19.103 --> 00:23:20.354
You always do.

275
00:23:22.607 --> 00:23:24.025
You'd know better than anyone.

276
00:24:19.077 --> 00:24:20.179
You sure you don't want help?

277
00:24:20.203 --> 00:24:22.163
No, it's just
a couple of things.

278
00:24:22.205 --> 00:24:26.918
I got most of it
before Seattle anyway. So.

279
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.169
Okay.

280
00:24:29.962 --> 00:24:30.962
Don't say I didn't ask.

281
00:25:07.831 --> 00:25:09.458
Tess, please.

282
00:25:44.408 --> 00:25:45.617
Hardin?

283
00:25:51.498 --> 00:25:53.459
Well, that was
one hell of a dream, man.

284
00:25:57.378 --> 00:25:58.714
Are you okay?
Yeah.

285
00:25:58.755 --> 00:26:00.048
Oh, fuck.

286
00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:01.299
Your hand looks pretty bad.

287
00:26:02.801 --> 00:26:04.469
Ah, it's not that bad.
I'll be fine.

288
00:26:05.595 --> 00:26:07.138
Bro, you were fucking wrecked.

289
00:26:10.183 --> 00:26:11.684
Hey, that American girl?

290
00:26:11.726 --> 00:26:13.579
I thought she was gonna tear
the whole place down, bro.

291
00:26:13.603 --> 00:26:14.729
She was a bitch.

292
00:26:47.426 --> 00:26:48.636
Dad?

293
00:26:52.723 --> 00:26:53.932
Dad?

294
00:26:56.309 --> 00:26:57.519
Dad?

295
00:27:12.074 --> 00:27:13.325
Dad?

296
00:27:31.385 --> 00:27:32.570
Oh no, no!
It's okay. It's okay.

297
00:27:32.594 --> 00:27:33.595
I got you, I got you.

298
00:28:46.248 --> 00:28:47.832
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

299
00:28:50.335 --> 00:28:51.628
Strong enough for you?

300
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:53.087
Yeah.
It wasn't strong enough.

301
00:28:54.547 --> 00:28:55.649
Hardin, your phone's ringing.

302
00:28:55.673 --> 00:28:57.549
It's Landon.

303
00:28:57.591 --> 00:28:59.135
Mr. Scott's very busy
at the moment.

304
00:28:59.176 --> 00:29:00.677
Can I take him...
Hey.

305
00:29:03.139 --> 00:29:04.765
Landon,
if I wanted to talk to you,

306
00:29:04.806 --> 00:29:06.909
I would have picked up the phone
the other 30 times you called.

307
00:29:06.933 --> 00:29:08.810
You know what? I know
you're a selfish prick.

308
00:29:08.852 --> 00:29:10.538
I thought you could help,
but, you know what?

309
00:29:10.562 --> 00:29:11.998
She's... she's... she's gonna
get through this without you.

310
00:29:12.022 --> 00:29:13.899
Get through what?

311
00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:15.150
La...?

312
00:29:23.741 --> 00:29:25.493
Landon? What's wrong?

313
00:29:25.535 --> 00:29:26.744
Just tell me she's okay.

314
00:29:27.912 --> 00:29:29.121
It's, um.

315
00:29:31.707 --> 00:29:33.959
It's Richard. He's dead.

316
00:29:34.001 --> 00:29:35.795
And, uh, Tessa found him.

317
00:29:38.839 --> 00:29:40.215
Fuck.

318
00:29:40.257 --> 00:29:41.967
Oh, fuck.

319
00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.179
Um. Where... where is she?

320
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:46.388
We're at her mom's.

321
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:48.265
She hasn't.
She hasn't spoken a word.

322
00:29:49.849 --> 00:29:51.643
Can you let me talk to her?

323
00:29:51.685 --> 00:29:52.870
I don't think
that's a good idea.

324
00:29:52.894 --> 00:29:54.062
Please.

325
00:29:54.103 --> 00:29:56.189
Please just put the phone
to her ear.

326
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:57.666
You know, you really shouldn't
be speaking to her.

327
00:29:57.690 --> 00:29:58.918
Then why the fuck
did you call?

328
00:29:58.942 --> 00:30:00.109
Of course, I'm who she needs!

329
00:30:00.151 --> 00:30:01.235
You know us!
You know me!

330
00:30:01.277 --> 00:30:02.695
All right, fine.

331
00:30:02.736 --> 00:30:04.988
Just stay calm, okay?
Just give me a second.

332
00:30:13.038 --> 00:30:14.247
Hey, Tessa.

333
00:30:15.874 --> 00:30:16.893
I have Hardin on the phone
for you.

334
00:30:16.917 --> 00:30:18.376
Um-mm, um-mm, um-umm.

335
00:30:18.418 --> 00:30:19.812
- Okay, okay. You don't have to.
- No, no. No, no.

336
00:30:19.836 --> 00:30:21.213
- No. No. No.
- It's fine.

337
00:30:21.254 --> 00:30:22.339
- No. No.
- Don't worry.

338
00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.590
- It's fine.
- No. No. Tess.

339
00:30:25.175 --> 00:30:26.634
Fuck!

340
00:31:03.961 --> 00:31:05.755
I mean, it's gonna be
me or your mom

341
00:31:05.796 --> 00:31:07.298
and she's gonna make you eat it.

342
00:31:08.883 --> 00:31:10.092
Looks pretty good.

343
00:31:12.011 --> 00:31:13.804
I'm just so tired.

344
00:31:32.572 --> 00:31:35.116
You're enjoying yourself.

345
00:31:35.158 --> 00:31:38.327
One little slip
and it could all be over.

346
00:31:40.288 --> 00:31:41.809
Are you still talking
about my shave?

347
00:31:46.126 --> 00:31:47.378
I meant the shave,

348
00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:49.422
but if you wanted to
talk about last night.

349
00:31:50.839 --> 00:31:53.466
I'm sorry, Tess.

350
00:31:53.508 --> 00:31:55.302
I didn't mean to
get that trashed.

351
00:31:55.343 --> 00:31:56.804
It's just with your dad...

352
00:31:56.845 --> 00:31:58.013
I'm not my dad. I'm not him.

353
00:31:59.681 --> 00:32:01.558
Tess, if you don't like it,
tell me.

354
00:32:01.599 --> 00:32:03.185
- I don't like it.
- Then I'll stop.

355
00:32:04.436 --> 00:32:05.770
I won't drink another drop.

356
00:32:05.812 --> 00:32:07.021
Really?

357
00:32:24.079 --> 00:32:25.080
What... what are you.?

358
00:32:54.566 --> 00:32:55.734
She doesn't want you here.

359
00:32:55.775 --> 00:32:56.944
I didn't fly

360
00:32:56.986 --> 00:32:58.612
5,000 fucking miles
to argue with you.

361
00:32:58.653 --> 00:33:00.030
I don't know if she's awake.

362
00:33:00.072 --> 00:33:01.299
Let me just at least see
if she's... Hardin!

363
00:33:01.323 --> 00:33:02.824
- Tess. Hey. I'm so...
- No.

364
00:33:02.866 --> 00:33:04.117
- No, no, no.
- Hey, hey, hey.

365
00:33:04.158 --> 00:33:05.535
Do you want him here, Tess?

366
00:33:05.577 --> 00:33:07.054
You're fucked if you think
I'm going anywhere.

367
00:33:07.078 --> 00:33:08.287
Tess.
No, get off me!

368
00:33:08.329 --> 00:33:09.288
Hey, it's okay.

369
00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:10.582
You gotta leave.

370
00:33:10.624 --> 00:33:11.767
You gotta leave
or I'm calling the cops?

371
00:33:11.791 --> 00:33:13.209
Call the fucking cops.
Call 'em.

372
00:33:13.251 --> 00:33:14.644
I'm not going anywhere!
That's not funny!

373
00:33:14.668 --> 00:33:16.480
- I'm not laughing!
- She doesn't want you here!

374
00:33:16.504 --> 00:33:18.256
You have no fucking idea
what she wants!

375
00:33:18.297 --> 00:33:19.524
You weren't here
when she needed you!

376
00:33:19.548 --> 00:33:21.384
Now, you're make...
You're making it worse.

377
00:33:22.968 --> 00:33:24.595
Tess?

378
00:33:24.637 --> 00:33:26.680
She's trying to avoid you.

379
00:33:26.722 --> 00:33:27.931
You're the reason she took...

380
00:33:32.644 --> 00:33:33.896
I'll check the front door.

381
00:34:00.254 --> 00:34:01.547
Hey, hey, Tess.

382
00:34:03.214 --> 00:34:05.842
It's not about you.

383
00:34:05.884 --> 00:34:06.944
I know.
I... I just want to...

384
00:34:06.968 --> 00:34:08.219
I need quiet.

385
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:10.681
Please.

386
00:34:53.137 --> 00:34:55.306
I haven't always
treated you fairly.

387
00:34:55.348 --> 00:34:57.308
You hate me, Carol.

388
00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:58.351
You've always hated me.

389
00:34:58.392 --> 00:34:59.977
And it's fine. I don't care.

390
00:35:00.018 --> 00:35:02.521
But you should know your opinion
means fuck all to me.

391
00:35:02.563 --> 00:35:04.398
And I mean that
in the nicest way.

392
00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.983
You're exactly like him.

393
00:35:06.024 --> 00:35:07.794
That's exactly how Richard
used to talk to my parents.

394
00:35:07.818 --> 00:35:09.402
I am not him.

395
00:35:09.444 --> 00:35:11.029
All right. Well.

396
00:35:11.071 --> 00:35:12.739
I only care
about what's best for Tessa.

397
00:35:12.781 --> 00:35:14.407
So do I.

398
00:35:14.449 --> 00:35:17.660
The one thing that
I thought that I taught her,

399
00:35:17.702 --> 00:35:20.288
and you may not believe me,

400
00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:24.459
was to not have to depend on
a man the way that I did.

401
00:35:24.501 --> 00:35:26.669
And now, look at her.

402
00:35:26.711 --> 00:35:30.047
She's... she's reduced to nothing
every time you leave.

403
00:35:30.089 --> 00:35:32.591
- Listen, I'm not...
- No, no. Let me finish.

404
00:35:32.633 --> 00:35:35.094
Yeah, you always come back

405
00:35:35.136 --> 00:35:38.139
the way that Richard
never did for us.

406
00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:39.806
But you never stay.

407
00:35:45.937 --> 00:35:48.481
I don't know
what you want from me, Carol.

408
00:35:48.523 --> 00:35:49.524
I love her.

409
00:35:49.565 --> 00:35:51.192
I'm never letting her go.

410
00:35:51.234 --> 00:35:53.545
If you really love her, then
you'll do what's best for her.

411
00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:55.530
And that is up to you now.

412
00:35:55.571 --> 00:35:58.408
Because you are the only person
that she'll listen to.

413
00:35:58.449 --> 00:36:00.868
That girl loves you way too much
for her own good.

414
00:36:01.869 --> 00:36:04.747
But Hardin, you and I both know

415
00:36:04.789 --> 00:36:07.416
that you can't give her
what she needs.

416
00:36:07.457 --> 00:36:11.211
And that is stopping her
from finding someone who will.

417
00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:32.315
I can only imagine
how you're feeling right now.

418
00:36:35.984 --> 00:36:39.280
I keep thinking about
the last time I saw him.

419
00:36:39.322 --> 00:36:41.449
He was eating
half my damn pizza.

420
00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:44.660
He was happy.

421
00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:47.037
Just happy
he had a place to stay.

422
00:36:55.253 --> 00:36:59.131
I am so sorry
for what happened in London.

423
00:37:05.429 --> 00:37:07.014
I really am.

424
00:37:07.056 --> 00:37:11.060
I thought we had a love
that was out of a novel.

425
00:37:11.102 --> 00:37:13.645
And no matter how hard
or fast or tough it was,

426
00:37:13.687 --> 00:37:15.814
we'd survive to tell the story.

427
00:37:17.691 --> 00:37:20.068
Hey.

428
00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:23.905
We do. And we can.
We can survive it.

429
00:37:27.743 --> 00:37:30.328
I don't wanna survive.
I want to live.

430
00:37:43.841 --> 00:37:47.136
I can't keep doing this.

431
00:37:47.177 --> 00:37:49.889
Tess.

432
00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:53.475
You don't love me enough
to fight for me.

433
00:37:53.517 --> 00:37:55.852
You gave up every time.

434
00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:06.070
I tried.

435
00:38:06.112 --> 00:38:08.156
I really fucking tried.

436
00:38:12.868 --> 00:38:14.995
I'm sorry I couldn't fix you.

437
00:38:19.166 --> 00:38:21.084
Me, too.

438
00:38:27.257 --> 00:38:28.508
Me, too.

439
00:38:57.994 --> 00:39:00.038
Who's paying for all this?

440
00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.248
You don't have to worry about
money right now, honey.

441
00:39:05.293 --> 00:39:06.627
Hey.

442
00:39:08.046 --> 00:39:10.631
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
It's okay.

443
00:39:13.843 --> 00:39:18.348
Ugh. Hey, I got make up on...
Oh. And.

444
00:39:18.389 --> 00:39:19.432
And a little bit of snot.

445
00:39:19.474 --> 00:39:20.683
Just a little bit.

446
00:39:23.102 --> 00:39:25.270
- You ready?
- Yeah.

447
00:40:08.728 --> 00:40:11.064
I hadn't seen my father
for nine years.

448
00:40:13.733 --> 00:40:16.403
But reconnecting with him
was one of the greatest gifts.

449
00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:19.656
Even if it was only briefly.

450
00:40:23.367 --> 00:40:25.787
He had so many demons, but.

451
00:40:27.538 --> 00:40:30.416
He was also so kind.

452
00:40:33.919 --> 00:40:35.629
And he was trying
to be better for me.

453
00:40:38.632 --> 00:40:39.841
I know that.

454
00:40:57.733 --> 00:40:59.401
You need a ride? Hardin?

455
00:41:02.279 --> 00:41:03.405
I don't think I should go.

456
00:41:03.447 --> 00:41:05.574
Why? You were his friend,
kind of.

457
00:41:05.615 --> 00:41:07.451
And you paid for it, so.

458
00:41:07.492 --> 00:41:10.245
Landon, do me a favor
and keep that between us.

459
00:41:10.287 --> 00:41:11.847
Sure. Doesn't mean
you shouldn't come.

460
00:41:11.871 --> 00:41:13.582
So, come.

461
00:41:47.364 --> 00:41:49.116
Sorry,
I didn't know that you were.

462
00:41:56.163 --> 00:41:58.625
I don't know half these people.

463
00:41:58.666 --> 00:42:00.292
It's kind of weird.

464
00:42:00.334 --> 00:42:03.713
When people go to funerals of
someone they don't even know.

465
00:42:03.755 --> 00:42:05.464
It's just especially him.

466
00:42:05.506 --> 00:42:08.425
I mean,
they're total hypocrites.

467
00:42:08.467 --> 00:42:10.802
No one here even liked him.

468
00:42:10.844 --> 00:42:12.053
You did.

469
00:42:14.473 --> 00:42:15.682
And even I did.

470
00:42:17.893 --> 00:42:19.853
I'm really mad at him.

471
00:42:19.895 --> 00:42:23.523
I'm like. I'm like pissed off.

472
00:42:23.564 --> 00:42:26.401
Hey, you have every right
to be mad at him.

473
00:42:26.442 --> 00:42:29.237
Whether he's dead or not.

474
00:42:29.279 --> 00:42:33.241
I saw how much it meant to you
to have him back in your life.

475
00:42:33.283 --> 00:42:36.035
And I think he is an idiot

476
00:42:36.076 --> 00:42:38.203
for throwing that all the way
just to get high.

477
00:42:42.499 --> 00:42:44.251
But I mean, I'm one to talk,
aren't I?

478
00:42:46.795 --> 00:42:48.505
I'm so sorry
it took something like this

479
00:42:48.547 --> 00:42:51.258
for me to realize
how much you mean to me.

480
00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:55.554
And how much.
I want to be there for you.

481
00:43:04.437 --> 00:43:06.439
I need to go back inside.

482
00:43:15.197 --> 00:43:16.740
Okay.

483
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:28.960
Oh, come on.

484
00:43:34.048 --> 00:43:36.217
Thank you so much
for everything.

485
00:43:36.258 --> 00:43:37.468
Yeah, of course.

486
00:43:38.678 --> 00:43:40.179
Hey, could I have a lift?

487
00:43:40.221 --> 00:43:41.806
My Ubers keep canceling.

488
00:43:41.848 --> 00:43:43.182
I'm supposed
to be meeting Nora

489
00:43:43.224 --> 00:43:45.142
and I'm already late, so.

490
00:43:45.184 --> 00:43:46.643
- Cool.
- Yeah.

491
00:43:48.562 --> 00:43:49.938
We'll see if this one turns up.

492
00:43:51.982 --> 00:43:53.817
Do you want to come with me?

493
00:43:53.859 --> 00:43:55.736
Back to Ken's.

494
00:43:55.777 --> 00:43:58.529
I should really stay here.

495
00:43:58.572 --> 00:43:59.948
It's been a long day

496
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:01.992
and I've got a doctor's
appointment in Seattle.

497
00:44:02.033 --> 00:44:03.534
Tomorrow.

498
00:44:03.576 --> 00:44:05.411
Sure.

499
00:44:05.453 --> 00:44:06.704
Vance and Kimberly back?

500
00:44:06.746 --> 00:44:08.164
They get back in the morning.

501
00:44:08.206 --> 00:44:10.208
They're trying to work
everything out for the baby.

502
00:44:15.588 --> 00:44:18.465
You know what? I'm...
I'm gonna come with you.

503
00:44:18.507 --> 00:44:19.985
I'm gonna start
looking for places up there.

504
00:44:20.009 --> 00:44:21.551
I'm ready.

505
00:44:21.593 --> 00:44:23.303
- I don't... I don't think...
- Tess. Tess,

506
00:44:23.345 --> 00:44:25.055
it's my turn
to be there for you.

507
00:44:26.473 --> 00:44:29.226
I don't want anything
from you anymore.

508
00:44:35.064 --> 00:44:36.274
I don't believe you.

509
00:44:38.484 --> 00:44:40.653
And I don't think
you believe yourself either.

510
00:44:58.671 --> 00:45:02.757
I'm so sorry that we weren't
at your father's funeral.

511
00:45:02.799 --> 00:45:04.259
No, no, it's fine.

512
00:45:04.301 --> 00:45:07.720
Um, ugh. I wouldn't have been
good company anyway.

513
00:45:09.889 --> 00:45:12.684
Uh, I was actually,

514
00:45:12.725 --> 00:45:15.269
I was thinking about
moving to New York.

515
00:45:16.563 --> 00:45:17.772
With Landon.

516
00:45:19.356 --> 00:45:22.068
New York? That...

517
00:45:22.109 --> 00:45:23.902
Wow!

518
00:45:23.945 --> 00:45:25.612
What's your plan?

519
00:45:25.654 --> 00:45:26.964
Do you know where
you're gonna work, what...?

520
00:45:26.988 --> 00:45:29.783
Not really.
I. I mean, I know it's far.

521
00:45:29.825 --> 00:45:32.202
I just think
that I need a fresh start.

522
00:45:33.954 --> 00:45:37.332
Tessa, it's okay to be sad.

523
00:45:37.373 --> 00:45:39.417
But if you let sadness
control your life,

524
00:45:39.459 --> 00:45:41.669
you'll never have one.

525
00:45:41.711 --> 00:45:45.465
But what if I just always
feel like this?

526
00:45:45.506 --> 00:45:48.050
What you've been through
is awful.

527
00:45:48.092 --> 00:45:49.719
But you are so strong,

528
00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.387
and I know
you'll get through this.

529
00:45:52.972 --> 00:45:55.558
It just takes time.

530
00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:59.436
And as for Hardin.

531
00:45:59.478 --> 00:46:01.813
Girl, just do your best
to pretend you're moving on

532
00:46:01.856 --> 00:46:04.941
and eventually,
you'll believe it.

533
00:46:15.201 --> 00:46:17.453
Why did you stay
if you knew she wanted him?

534
00:46:19.622 --> 00:46:22.333
I loved her.

535
00:46:22.375 --> 00:46:24.353
I thought that she would see
that he couldn't give her

536
00:46:24.377 --> 00:46:27.796
the stability that I could.

537
00:46:27.838 --> 00:46:34.887
You know, I imagine if.
If Tessa marries another man,

538
00:46:35.929 --> 00:46:38.723
this is how he's gonna feel,
competing with a memory of you.

539
00:46:38.766 --> 00:46:41.018
I'm not Vance, okay?
Just because.

540
00:46:44.104 --> 00:46:46.898
I'm not him.

541
00:46:52.779 --> 00:46:54.864
You are.

542
00:46:56.448 --> 00:46:58.325
Okay.

543
00:47:04.498 --> 00:47:07.083
So, it's... it's true.

544
00:47:07.125 --> 00:47:09.210
He's your father.

545
00:47:10.671 --> 00:47:14.507
I knew it. I knew it
the first time that I saw you.

546
00:47:14.549 --> 00:47:16.718
You look just like him.

547
00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:18.469
I did everything so wrong.

548
00:47:21.347 --> 00:47:23.349
And I couldn't stand
that you were his.

549
00:47:25.185 --> 00:47:27.978
That doesn't excuse
the drinking, but.

550
00:47:31.816 --> 00:47:33.776
I've loved you.

551
00:47:33.818 --> 00:47:35.027
I still love you.

552
00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:39.823
You're my son.

553
00:47:54.337 --> 00:47:55.546
I'm sorry.

554
00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:25.325
Let's talk about
these test results.

555
00:48:25.367 --> 00:48:27.577
Unfortunately,
the chances are very slim

556
00:48:27.619 --> 00:48:30.287
that you will carry to term.

557
00:48:30.329 --> 00:48:33.207
There are other options.

558
00:48:33.249 --> 00:48:37.962
Adoption is a route
many people choose.

559
00:49:29.428 --> 00:49:30.887
- Hey.
- Hey.

560
00:49:32.305 --> 00:49:34.065
Hey, I've been trying you all
day. What's up?

561
00:49:35.016 --> 00:49:36.810
Um, I left my phone on silent.

562
00:49:38.352 --> 00:49:40.063
Is everything okay?

563
00:49:40.104 --> 00:49:46.444
No, not really.
But. I have to go.

564
00:50:09.591 --> 00:50:11.217
Tess?

565
00:50:12.093 --> 00:50:13.302
Tessa?

566
00:50:14.929 --> 00:50:16.138
Hey, Tess.

567
00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:19.475
Hardin.

568
00:50:19.516 --> 00:50:20.767
Hey, come inside.

569
00:50:22.811 --> 00:50:24.187
I had a feeling you'd come.

570
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:25.606
- Did you?
- Yeah.

571
00:50:27.399 --> 00:50:28.442
It's late.

572
00:50:28.484 --> 00:50:29.943
It is.

573
00:50:36.116 --> 00:50:39.077
Do you want a baby with me?

574
00:50:39.119 --> 00:50:40.578
No, I don't want
a baby with you.

575
00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:44.206
I mean.

576
00:50:44.249 --> 00:50:45.500
I just.

577
00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:48.961
I don't want a baby right now.

578
00:50:51.255 --> 00:50:52.715
I love sleep.

579
00:50:52.757 --> 00:50:56.260
My life has the tendency
to fall apart when I'm awake.

580
00:50:56.301 --> 00:50:59.054
Your life is
gonna be just fine, okay?

581
00:50:59.096 --> 00:51:02.432
You said it once.
There can be no happy end to it.

582
00:51:04.351 --> 00:51:05.602
I didn't mean that.

583
00:51:06.811 --> 00:51:08.187
And I shouldn't have said it.

584
00:51:11.149 --> 00:51:13.109
I love you enough now.

585
00:51:13.151 --> 00:51:15.569
What do you want to do?

586
00:51:15.611 --> 00:51:17.571
- I love you.
- Shush. We can quote Hemingway

587
00:51:17.613 --> 00:51:19.573
when we're sober, okay?

588
00:51:19.615 --> 00:51:21.784
For now, just go to sleep.

589
00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:26.163
Go to sleep.

590
00:51:27.414 --> 00:51:29.207
Stay.

591
00:51:58.027 --> 00:51:59.403
Morning.

592
00:51:59.445 --> 00:52:00.654
Morning.

593
00:52:03.031 --> 00:52:08.620
Um, what did I say last night?

594
00:52:10.288 --> 00:52:13.291
You mean,
besides quoting Hemingway?

595
00:52:13.333 --> 00:52:16.169
Oh, no, I didn't.

596
00:52:16.211 --> 00:52:17.420
It wasn't that bad.

597
00:52:22.633 --> 00:52:23.968
Do you, uh.

598
00:52:25.636 --> 00:52:27.558
Do you want to tell me
what's been bothering you?

599
00:52:29.389 --> 00:52:31.016
It's nothing.
It's the doctor.

600
00:52:31.058 --> 00:52:32.267
Listen.

601
00:52:33.518 --> 00:52:35.120
If you are pregnant,
I just wanted to say

602
00:52:35.145 --> 00:52:37.481
that I would genuinely
be okay with that.

603
00:52:38.773 --> 00:52:41.067
It really would not be so bad
having kids with you.

604
00:52:43.612 --> 00:52:47.115
Or, obviously, if you're...
If you're not pregnant,

605
00:52:47.156 --> 00:52:49.826
I guess maybe
after you finish college,

606
00:52:49.868 --> 00:52:51.995
or I don't know, either way.

607
00:52:56.249 --> 00:52:57.666
I can't get pregnant.

608
00:53:00.336 --> 00:53:03.255
The. The doctor said
that it'll...

609
00:53:03.296 --> 00:53:06.675
It'd be almost impossible
for me to conceive.

610
00:53:06.717 --> 00:53:09.136
And even if I did, there'd be
a high risk of miscarriage

611
00:53:09.177 --> 00:53:10.678
so I can't.

612
00:53:21.481 --> 00:53:23.400
Uh, can you say somethin'?

613
00:53:27.069 --> 00:53:28.738
I don't know what to say.

614
00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:30.215
What do you... what do you mean,
you don't know what...

615
00:53:30.239 --> 00:53:31.490
You don't want kids anyway.

616
00:53:31.532 --> 00:53:34.326
No, I-I-I didn't.

617
00:53:35.744 --> 00:53:38.247
Now, it just feels like
it's been taken away from us.

618
00:53:38.289 --> 00:53:41.082
Uh, no, not from you.
From me.

619
00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:45.837
Wait.

620
00:53:45.879 --> 00:53:47.231
That was the wrong thing to say.
You know I didn't mean it.

621
00:53:47.255 --> 00:53:48.799
Tess, wait. Please wait.

622
00:53:49.966 --> 00:53:51.509
Tessa.

623
00:53:51.551 --> 00:53:53.803
Please just don't
shut down on me again.

624
00:53:53.844 --> 00:53:57.890
I don't give a fuck if we can
have kids or not, honestly.

625
00:53:57.932 --> 00:53:59.993
I'm sorry that you feel like
I took something from you.

626
00:54:00.017 --> 00:54:01.436
- I don't.
- But you're not the one

627
00:54:01.477 --> 00:54:03.479
who's just had their dreams
crushed here, you know?

628
00:54:05.355 --> 00:54:06.958
Like you didn't want kids
until two seconds ago

629
00:54:06.982 --> 00:54:08.901
which just came out of nowhere.

630
00:54:12.612 --> 00:54:13.905
I just want to be with you.

631
00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:17.909
Kids, no kids.

632
00:54:17.951 --> 00:54:19.035
When I was in London,

633
00:54:19.077 --> 00:54:20.829
I could not stop
thinking about you.

634
00:54:22.664 --> 00:54:26.042
Right. Yeah, I'm sure...
I'm sure you saw my face

635
00:54:26.084 --> 00:54:28.169
when you were sleeping
with that girl at the party.

636
00:54:28.211 --> 00:54:29.796
Who are you.? What?

637
00:54:29.838 --> 00:54:33.507
Te... nothing
of the sort happened.

638
00:54:33.549 --> 00:54:34.985
And I won't lie to you.
Shut up. You did.

639
00:54:35.009 --> 00:54:37.261
She did... she did try
to kiss me and when she did,

640
00:54:37.303 --> 00:54:39.930
I literally threw up, so.

641
00:54:39.972 --> 00:54:42.641
You literally threw up.

642
00:54:42.683 --> 00:54:43.976
I did.

643
00:54:44.017 --> 00:54:46.144
- Threw up.
- I threw up.

644
00:54:46.186 --> 00:54:50.190
Instant noodles, and it went
on her head.

645
00:54:53.026 --> 00:54:54.611
Good.

646
00:54:54.652 --> 00:54:55.695
Good?

647
00:54:55.737 --> 00:54:57.364
- Yeah, good.
- Good.

648
00:55:10.626 --> 00:55:12.919
And that is why
Hardin is afraid of gerbils.

649
00:55:15.547 --> 00:55:16.941
If you don't stop
makin' up stories,

650
00:55:16.965 --> 00:55:18.847
I'll tell Nora about that time
you wet yourself.

651
00:55:20.135 --> 00:55:21.177
Touché.

652
00:55:21.219 --> 00:55:22.679
All right, then.

653
00:55:22.721 --> 00:55:24.973
This is so good.
The sauce is amazing.

654
00:55:25.015 --> 00:55:27.100
It's all of Landon's favorites
before he leaves us.

655
00:55:27.142 --> 00:55:30.395
This food
almost makes me sad to go.

656
00:55:30.436 --> 00:55:34.232
So Nora, what part of New York
are you in?

657
00:55:34.274 --> 00:55:36.776
Um, East 14th and First Ave.

658
00:55:36.817 --> 00:55:39.695
What she actually meant was
how far is it from Landon.

659
00:55:41.489 --> 00:55:43.908
- Like.
- Like 50 minutes by train.

660
00:55:43.949 --> 00:55:45.284
Fifty minutes.

661
00:55:45.325 --> 00:55:46.594
I'm sorry. It's just
practically long distance.

662
00:55:46.618 --> 00:55:47.679
I don't know how
you're gonna make that work.

663
00:55:47.703 --> 00:55:49.413
I mean,
I have to go through there

664
00:55:49.454 --> 00:55:51.248
to get to class every day.

665
00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:52.666
I mean, not... not that we'd be

666
00:55:52.707 --> 00:55:54.834
seeing each other every day.
But I mean, we could

667
00:55:54.876 --> 00:55:56.961
if you wanted too.

668
00:55:59.130 --> 00:56:01.425
So, Hardin,
graduation is looming.

669
00:56:01.466 --> 00:56:02.527
No, we're not doing this again.
I don't want...

670
00:56:02.551 --> 00:56:03.694
Have you given more thought
to...

671
00:56:03.718 --> 00:56:05.112
No, I haven't
'cause I'm not going to

672
00:56:05.136 --> 00:56:06.906
walk for graduation, okay?
I don't want to walk.

673
00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:08.347
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

674
00:56:08.389 --> 00:56:09.682
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

675
00:56:11.809 --> 00:56:13.602
I just thought.

676
00:56:13.644 --> 00:56:15.806
I don't know. I just thought
for sure you'd reconsider.

677
00:56:17.022 --> 00:56:18.566
So you've obviously asked her

678
00:56:18.607 --> 00:56:20.609
to ask me?
What? What?

679
00:56:21.944 --> 00:56:23.706
Fuck it, fine. I'll walk
for graduation then.

680
00:56:25.155 --> 00:56:26.636
- Yes!
- Don't make me change my mind.

681
00:56:27.699 --> 00:56:29.492
To walking.

682
00:56:29.534 --> 00:56:30.702
Cheers to that.

683
00:56:30.743 --> 00:56:32.870
- To walking.
- Cheers to that.

684
00:56:32.912 --> 00:56:34.194
- To walking.
- Here we go again.

685
00:56:40.795 --> 00:56:42.880
Come on.

686
00:56:53.474 --> 00:56:57.018
Hey, I need to talk to you
about something.

687
00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:58.269
Okay.

688
00:57:14.327 --> 00:57:16.871
I made a decision
about something, and I didn't.

689
00:57:19.499 --> 00:57:22.334
With everything
that's been going on

690
00:57:22.376 --> 00:57:24.419
because of a lot of things, but.

691
00:57:26.881 --> 00:57:28.465
We need time apart.

692
00:57:28.507 --> 00:57:34.596
Like. Like really apart.

693
00:57:34.638 --> 00:57:35.639
And...

694
00:57:37.015 --> 00:57:39.058
This seems like
the only way to make sure

695
00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:41.728
that that actually happen.

696
00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:43.354
Okay, why?

697
00:57:43.396 --> 00:57:46.315
Because we fight
more than we get along.

698
00:57:46.357 --> 00:57:50.194
And when we make up,
it's over sex.

699
00:57:52.696 --> 00:57:54.657
That's not...
That's not really true.

700
00:57:54.698 --> 00:57:56.700
It is, and it's not healthy.

701
00:57:56.742 --> 00:57:59.412
How is sex not healthy?

702
00:57:59.453 --> 00:58:03.456
We've been having lots of fun,
happy, consensual sex.

703
00:58:03.498 --> 00:58:06.751
And it's been full of fucking
love and fucking trust.

704
00:58:06.794 --> 00:58:09.462
I can't keep going around
in circles like this.

705
00:58:11.423 --> 00:58:15.718
Okay, okay.
I understand.

706
00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:18.012
And I do have a lot to work on.

707
00:58:18.054 --> 00:58:19.556
But we have so much time.

708
00:58:19.597 --> 00:58:21.015
We have all the time
in the world,

709
00:58:21.057 --> 00:58:22.308
and I will work on them.

710
00:58:22.349 --> 00:58:23.475
And I can come live with you

711
00:58:23.517 --> 00:58:25.602
in Seattle.
Okay. Okay.

712
00:58:25.644 --> 00:58:28.147
I'm moving.

713
00:58:28.189 --> 00:58:30.024
Okay.

714
00:58:30.066 --> 00:58:31.900
I'm moving to New York.

715
00:58:31.942 --> 00:58:33.319
I'm gonna live with Landon.

716
00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:34.861
Landon?

717
00:58:34.903 --> 00:58:35.904
What? This was his idea?

718
00:58:35.946 --> 00:58:37.948
No, no, no.
This was my idea.

719
00:58:37.989 --> 00:58:39.199
This wasn't. Don't...

720
00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:40.760
He's supposed to be
my fucking brother.

721
00:58:40.784 --> 00:58:43.078
It's not like that.
It's... no! Hey!

722
00:58:43.745 --> 00:58:45.371
- No, no.
- I'm just gonna...

723
00:58:45.413 --> 00:58:47.540
New York! New York! You
didn't fucking tell me!

724
00:58:47.582 --> 00:58:49.685
Well, it wasn't my call. You'd
broken up with her. What do you...?

725
00:58:49.709 --> 00:58:51.752
You've been pretending
to be my fucking friend!

726
00:58:51.794 --> 00:58:54.088
I didn't pretend shit, Hardin!

727
00:58:54.129 --> 00:58:56.549
I'm her friend too, and I'm
cleaning up your shit as usual.

728
00:58:57.675 --> 00:58:58.676
Well, go ahead.

729
00:58:58.718 --> 00:58:59.969
Fucking hit me, you big man.

730
00:59:00.010 --> 00:59:01.261
Big piece of shit.

731
00:59:09.811 --> 00:59:11.980
Fuck.

732
00:59:31.124 --> 00:59:34.585
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Tess, but.

733
00:59:36.253 --> 00:59:38.130
You know, of all people,

734
00:59:38.171 --> 00:59:41.508
he knows
how much you mean to me.

735
00:59:41.549 --> 00:59:42.760
That you're my

736
00:59:42.801 --> 00:59:44.195
fucking lifeline,
and he didn't tell me,

737
00:59:44.219 --> 00:59:46.596
and that fucking hurts.

738
00:59:46.638 --> 00:59:49.391
It fucking hurts, okay?

739
00:59:54.103 --> 00:59:56.022
I'm shit without you.

740
00:59:59.275 --> 01:00:03.070
I'm just as good at dooming
this relationship as you.

741
01:00:03.112 --> 01:00:05.072
Is it doomed?

742
01:00:05.114 --> 01:00:07.074
Is it? I feel like
we can make this work.

743
01:00:08.909 --> 01:00:11.912
You're trying,
and I see that. But I.

744
01:00:11.953 --> 01:00:13.914
I can't keep doing this
back and forth.

745
01:00:13.955 --> 01:00:16.458
It's... it's... it's
not just with you.

746
01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:17.793
It's with me.

747
01:00:17.834 --> 01:00:19.836
You can't just escape yourself

748
01:00:19.878 --> 01:00:21.922
by moving from one place
to another, you know.

749
01:00:24.382 --> 01:00:25.800
You know that, right?

750
01:00:25.841 --> 01:00:30.888
I need to figure things out.
And. If you love me,

751
01:00:30.930 --> 01:00:32.932
if you really love me...
I do. I do.

752
01:00:32.973 --> 01:00:35.142
Then I need you to promise
not to follow me.

753
01:00:37.978 --> 01:00:39.122
- I can't do that.
- Promise me.

754
01:00:39.146 --> 01:00:40.522
I can't do that.

755
01:00:40.564 --> 01:00:42.691
We can make this work!
Promise not to follow me.

756
01:00:42.733 --> 01:00:44.359
Give me some time

757
01:00:44.401 --> 01:00:48.322
or we're gonna end up
taking everyone down with us.

758
01:00:48.363 --> 01:00:49.573
How long?

759
01:00:52.492 --> 01:00:54.411
How long, Tess?

760
01:00:54.453 --> 01:00:56.162
How long?

761
01:00:56.204 --> 01:00:57.622
I don't know.

762
01:00:57.664 --> 01:00:58.998
I don't know.

763
01:01:00.834 --> 01:01:03.461
Okay. Okay.

764
01:01:24.064 --> 01:01:26.274
So I'm glad this is
the right place.

765
01:01:27.234 --> 01:01:28.818
Hi.

766
01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:31.028
Oh. Hello. Hello.

767
01:01:59.514 --> 01:02:00.849
Well, I don't agree...

768
01:02:23.913 --> 01:02:24.955
Welcome to The Lookout.

769
01:02:26.956 --> 01:02:28.058
- I'm so excited.
- Thank you so much.

770
01:02:28.082 --> 01:02:29.584
- You're welcome.
- Thank you so much.

771
01:02:29.626 --> 01:02:30.919
The best.

772
01:02:51.689 --> 01:02:54.066
I haven't actually
read this before.

773
01:02:58.904 --> 01:03:03.783
"He lived his life for himself
and then it shifted."

774
01:03:05.535 --> 01:03:07.120
"It became much more
than waking up

775
01:03:07.162 --> 01:03:09.331
and going to sleep."

776
01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.082
And you don't know
what he's doing in town?

777
01:03:55.124 --> 01:03:56.208
What?

778
01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:58.043
You don't know
why Hardin's coming?

779
01:03:58.085 --> 01:03:59.920
He did not say, but uh,

780
01:03:59.962 --> 01:04:01.964
I couldn't have him
staying at a hotel.

781
01:04:02.006 --> 01:04:03.965
Especially with a minibar.
Is that shitty?

782
01:04:04.008 --> 01:04:05.134
I know he's sober now.

783
01:04:05.175 --> 01:04:07.969
No, no. No, I get it.

784
01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:10.305
And, you know, I mean,

785
01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:12.056
I'm working doubles
this week anyway,

786
01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:14.851
so I won't even have to see him.

787
01:04:14.893 --> 01:04:18.646
Nora said if, uh,
it gets too weird,

788
01:04:18.687 --> 01:04:19.748
you can crash at her place.

789
01:04:19.772 --> 01:04:21.125
I mean it's just.
Ei... either way,

790
01:04:21.149 --> 01:04:22.459
it was going to be shitty like...

791
01:04:22.483 --> 01:04:24.235
Oh no, it's fine.
I'll be fine.

792
01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:25.528
You're doing the thing

793
01:04:25.569 --> 01:04:26.630
where you go, you go...
Oh, please.

794
01:04:26.654 --> 01:04:28.071
"I'll be fine,"
and you look away.

795
01:04:28.113 --> 01:04:29.282
Honestly?

796
01:04:29.323 --> 01:04:30.408
Yeah.

797
01:04:30.449 --> 01:04:31.742
- Wallet, keys, phone?
- Yes.

798
01:04:31.784 --> 01:04:33.243
- Okay.
- Okay.

799
01:04:33.285 --> 01:04:34.286
Ciao.

800
01:04:44.296 --> 01:04:50.968
Hey, so Landon just got here,
and Hardin is with him.

801
01:04:52.053 --> 01:04:54.180
They are asking
for your section.

802
01:04:56.223 --> 01:04:59.060
Uh. Yeah, of course.

803
01:04:59.101 --> 01:05:02.354
- You sure?
- Yeah. I guess.

804
01:05:16.326 --> 01:05:17.869
Tessa.

805
01:05:20.205 --> 01:05:22.040
Theresa?

806
01:05:22.082 --> 01:05:25.084
Uh, yeah.

807
01:05:25.126 --> 01:05:28.296
I put my full name
on the job application.

808
01:05:28.338 --> 01:05:29.964
Uh, Hardin wanted to eat here.

809
01:05:30.005 --> 01:05:31.924
That's. That's.

810
01:05:31.966 --> 01:05:33.217
That's fine.

811
01:05:34.301 --> 01:05:35.260
Yeah, of course.

812
01:05:35.302 --> 01:05:36.386
Let me seat you guys.

813
01:05:36.428 --> 01:05:38.263
Yeah.

814
01:05:38.848 --> 01:05:39.932
Nice to see you.

815
01:05:39.974 --> 01:05:40.933
Nice to see you, too.

816
01:05:40.975 --> 01:05:42.017
Yup.

817
01:05:49.232 --> 01:05:50.984
Sorry.

818
01:05:56.530 --> 01:05:58.092
So, you've been here
since this morning.

819
01:05:58.116 --> 01:06:00.576
Yeah,
I'm working a double today.

820
01:06:00.618 --> 01:06:02.120
When will you get off?

821
01:06:03.579 --> 01:06:08.959
Uh, one, so I should be home
around two.

822
01:06:09.001 --> 01:06:11.169
Every single day.

823
01:06:12.713 --> 01:06:16.341
And I'll try
not to wake you, again.

824
01:06:17.885 --> 01:06:19.636
What can I get you guys?

825
01:06:27.143 --> 01:06:28.645
Good night.

826
01:06:34.358 --> 01:06:36.277
I just wanted to make sure
you got home okay.

827
01:06:37.611 --> 01:06:40.156
You do know that
I walk this every night, right?

828
01:06:46.287 --> 01:06:47.746
Since you're here.

829
01:06:53.251 --> 01:06:55.461
So why are you
working here anyway?

830
01:06:55.503 --> 01:06:58.048
Isn't Vance opening
his new publishing house?

831
01:06:58.089 --> 01:07:01.134
Uh, I just want to do
something on my own.

832
01:07:02.718 --> 01:07:05.137
I like it. Nora's here.

833
01:07:05.179 --> 01:07:07.723
I make more money
than you'd think.

834
01:07:07.765 --> 01:07:11.811
Uh, plus it keeps me busy while
I'm waiting to get into NYU.

835
01:07:11.852 --> 01:07:14.313
What?
You haven't gotten in yet?

836
01:07:14.354 --> 01:07:18.317
No, but I'm hoping
for the spring semester.

837
01:07:21.195 --> 01:07:22.571
Are you happy?

838
01:07:24.531 --> 01:07:26.450
Yeah.

839
01:07:26.491 --> 01:07:27.742
Are you seeing anyone?

840
01:07:28.785 --> 01:07:31.830
Yes.
I'm out every night

841
01:07:31.871 --> 01:07:34.874
being wined and dined.

842
01:07:34.916 --> 01:07:36.209
I'm actually
not dating anyone.

843
01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:38.586
I'm quite conservative
in that way.

844
01:07:38.627 --> 01:07:39.587
- Hey, girlie.
- Hey, watch it!

845
01:07:39.628 --> 01:07:40.963
Hey! It's okay.

846
01:07:42.631 --> 01:07:44.258
Hey, Joe.

847
01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:46.969
Uh, I brought you some fries and
the sliders that you love.

848
01:07:48.471 --> 01:07:49.805
I'll see you tomorrow.

849
01:07:54.642 --> 01:07:56.478
It makes me feel better
about my dad.

850
01:08:01.066 --> 01:08:02.275
Do you wanna.?

851
01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:05.152
Tomorrow, if you're not working,

852
01:08:05.194 --> 01:08:07.572
I have some free time
if you wanna.?

853
01:08:10.407 --> 01:08:14.245
I'm working a double.
That I took

854
01:08:14.286 --> 01:08:17.539
so I wouldn't have to see you.

855
01:08:38.434 --> 01:08:39.644
Hey.

856
01:08:39.685 --> 01:08:41.229
- Stop.
- Hey, hey.

857
01:08:41.271 --> 01:08:43.523
- Stop. Stop! Stop!
- Hey, Hardin.

858
01:08:45.232 --> 01:08:47.568
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

859
01:08:49.069 --> 01:08:50.195
It's okay.

860
01:08:51.864 --> 01:08:53.615
Oh, fuck.

861
01:09:25.938 --> 01:09:27.439
Thank you.

862
01:09:34.821 --> 01:09:37.074
I miss this.

863
01:09:41.494 --> 01:09:43.788
Me too.

864
01:10:21.156 --> 01:10:22.325
Tessa.

865
01:10:22.367 --> 01:10:23.909
I'm so sorry. I got lost.

866
01:10:23.951 --> 01:10:25.703
I didn't know
which turning it was.

867
01:10:30.124 --> 01:10:34.044
Hey! Hey, Joe.
Here you go.

868
01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:40.342
Stay safe, man.

869
01:11:02.029 --> 01:11:03.531
You seem different, like.

870
01:11:04.782 --> 01:11:06.491
Like the same
but just different.

871
01:11:07.534 --> 01:11:11.413
I'm still me.

872
01:11:11.454 --> 01:11:12.789
A fair bit of therapy,

873
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:14.707
and I'm hitting the gym more
but I'm still me.

874
01:11:19.045 --> 01:11:20.255
Do you still drink?

875
01:11:22.465 --> 01:11:24.258
I do have the odd beer
or glass of wine

876
01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:26.236
but I am never chugging
a bottle of whiskey again,

877
01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:27.720
if that's what you mean.

878
01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:37.479
Tess.

879
01:11:42.192 --> 01:11:43.444
Well, how is it then?

880
01:11:48.073 --> 01:11:49.115
Oi, Tess.

881
01:11:49.157 --> 01:11:50.478
At least share it
if you're gonna.

882
01:12:09.634 --> 01:12:10.862
You know,
if I wasn't such a gentleman,

883
01:12:10.886 --> 01:12:12.762
I would have you
on this counter right now.

884
01:12:12.804 --> 01:12:15.015
I thought
you weren't a gentleman.

885
01:12:17.684 --> 01:12:20.019
I'm half gentleman right now.

886
01:12:21.896 --> 01:12:23.022
A half?

887
01:12:27.902 --> 01:12:29.487
And that means.

888
01:12:29.528 --> 01:12:31.155
As much as I want you.

889
01:12:34.075 --> 01:12:35.326
I can't be with you.

890
01:12:37.786 --> 01:12:39.872
Until you're really ready
to be with me.

891
01:12:43.584 --> 01:12:45.753
Or. What?

892
01:12:47.337 --> 01:12:49.422
Come on, grab some plates.
Let's eat.

893
01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:56.596
Tess, plates.
Now, please.

894
01:13:18.450 --> 01:13:19.868
What?

895
01:13:21.870 --> 01:13:23.622
Nothing.

896
01:13:29.085 --> 01:13:30.211
Good morning.

897
01:13:30.253 --> 01:13:32.047
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

898
01:13:38.928 --> 01:13:40.220
Bye.

899
01:13:50.355 --> 01:13:51.690
Finally.

900
01:13:53.358 --> 01:13:55.694
And it feels good.

901
01:13:56.695 --> 01:13:58.905
I'm gonna go take a shower.

902
01:14:00.323 --> 01:14:01.741
Thank you, Tess.

903
01:14:14.295 --> 01:14:15.671
Hey.
Hey.

904
01:14:15.713 --> 01:14:16.922
How's work?

905
01:14:16.964 --> 01:14:17.965
Good.

906
01:14:20.050 --> 01:14:21.469
Long.

907
01:14:23.011 --> 01:14:25.597
Is, um, is Landon home?

908
01:14:25.638 --> 01:14:27.015
Uh, he's staying at Nora's.

909
01:14:30.768 --> 01:14:33.105
Are you going out?

910
01:14:33.146 --> 01:14:34.147
No.

911
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:35.565
Got an early meeting tomorrow.

912
01:14:56.377 --> 01:14:57.586
Give me your feet.

913
01:15:32.202 --> 01:15:33.412
Come sit in front of me.

914
01:16:01.354 --> 01:16:02.690
That feels good.

915
01:16:04.607 --> 01:16:06.484
It would feel a lot better
without this.

916
01:16:07.986 --> 01:16:09.321
Just saying.

917
01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:30.382
This is your idea.

918
01:16:30.424 --> 01:16:32.968
I know.

919
01:17:01.662 --> 01:17:03.247
In five months, Theresa.

920
01:17:03.288 --> 01:17:08.668
You are pushing every ounce
of my self-control.

921
01:17:43.201 --> 01:17:44.870
I have thought about this

922
01:17:44.912 --> 01:17:50.917
every single second
of every fucking day.

923
01:17:52.794 --> 01:17:54.462
You have no idea.

924
01:19:04.445 --> 01:19:06.655
Please.

925
01:19:06.697 --> 01:19:08.532
I know.

926
01:19:08.574 --> 01:19:11.076
I know.

927
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:27.318
So, by sleeping with me,
I think you just agreed

928
01:19:27.342 --> 01:19:28.385
to start seeing me again.

929
01:19:28.426 --> 01:19:30.553
Mm. Is that so?

930
01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:35.141
I love this.
What?

931
01:19:35.182 --> 01:19:36.601
This. Us.

932
01:19:39.061 --> 01:19:41.023
You know we're always going to
be like this, Tess.

933
01:19:44.233 --> 01:19:46.193
I really have to
go to this meeting

934
01:19:46.235 --> 01:19:48.445
so I will see you when I'm back.
Okay.

935
01:19:50.071 --> 01:19:52.282
Okay.

936
01:20:11.676 --> 01:20:13.886
It was the fall when he met her.

937
01:20:13.928 --> 01:20:16.681
In his world, he was only
concerned about one thing.

938
01:20:16.722 --> 01:20:18.808
Himself.

939
01:20:18.849 --> 01:20:20.559
He'd won every bet so far,

940
01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:22.519
and this was
supposed to be no different,

941
01:20:22.561 --> 01:20:24.563
although in Tessa's nearness,

942
01:20:24.604 --> 01:20:27.482
he felt an apprehension
this time.

943
01:20:27.524 --> 01:20:30.652
In a Darcy-inspired gesture,
he funded her father's funeral.

944
01:20:32.236 --> 01:20:34.339
It was only the beginning of
what he felt he needed to do

945
01:20:34.363 --> 01:20:37.158
to absolve himself.

946
01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:39.577
His guilt led heavy in the call
that he hadn't answered.

947
01:20:41.871 --> 01:20:43.414
The only reason he didn't
lose himself

948
01:20:43.456 --> 01:20:44.582
again in darkness.

949
01:20:44.623 --> 01:20:46.875
.Was in knowing
her dad was happy.

950
01:20:46.917 --> 01:20:49.002
His death
was surely an accident.

951
01:20:49.044 --> 01:20:51.171
It didn't bring him back,
but his talk of his future

952
01:20:51.213 --> 01:20:53.048
and appreciating
the time off the street.

953
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:56.677
Though she was unable to
bear children of her own,

954
01:20:56.719 --> 01:20:59.012
she couldn't let go
of the dream of them.

955
01:20:59.054 --> 01:21:01.723
He knew that,
and loved her even so.

956
01:21:01.764 --> 01:21:03.641
He tried not to be selfish.

957
01:21:03.683 --> 01:21:06.144
But he couldn't help thinking
about the little versions of him

958
01:21:06.186 --> 01:21:07.395
she couldn't give him.

959
01:21:08.938 --> 01:21:11.649
He hopes she will understand
just how broken he was

960
01:21:11.691 --> 01:21:13.568
and see how much
she affected his life.

961
01:21:24.161 --> 01:21:25.621
"She stumbled

962
01:21:25.662 --> 01:21:27.914
"through the room the way
that tasteless girls move

963
01:21:27.956 --> 01:21:29.375
when they drink too much."

964
01:21:29.416 --> 01:21:30.959
Stop reading that.

965
01:21:31.001 --> 01:21:33.754
No, no, no,
you don't get to write my story

966
01:21:33.795 --> 01:21:35.421
and then tell me
I can't read it.

967
01:21:35.463 --> 01:21:36.673
That part's not about you.

968
01:21:36.715 --> 01:21:39.634
How long have you been
writing about us?

969
01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:46.349
After we kissed.

970
01:21:46.391 --> 01:21:47.850
You. Like the first time?

971
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:52.813
Are you fucking kidding me?

972
01:21:54.314 --> 01:21:55.650
You're just.

973
01:21:57.401 --> 01:21:58.568
Tess, I'll explain

974
01:21:58.610 --> 01:21:59.670
if you'll just listen.
Oh, no.

975
01:21:59.694 --> 01:22:01.989
You already have, on every page.

976
01:22:02.031 --> 01:22:03.573
- This is what I did to vent.
- Great.

977
01:22:03.615 --> 01:22:04.658
Where are you going?

978
01:22:04.699 --> 01:22:06.618
- I.
- Tess!

979
01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:09.663
I'm done. This. We're just a
bomb waiting to explode.

980
01:22:09.704 --> 01:22:10.890
This was a wake-up call.
What do you mean?

981
01:22:10.914 --> 01:22:12.099
You're acting like I wrote that

982
01:22:12.123 --> 01:22:13.267
to purposely hurt you.
How-

983
01:22:13.291 --> 01:22:14.793
How did you think
I was gonna feel?

984
01:22:14.834 --> 01:22:16.753
It was not all about you.

985
01:22:16.795 --> 01:22:19.463
You would never let me read
what you were writing in there.

986
01:22:19.505 --> 01:22:21.132
And now the whole world gets to.

987
01:22:21.174 --> 01:22:22.675
Stuff about me.

988
01:22:22.716 --> 01:22:24.302
Stuff about my dad.

989
01:22:25.553 --> 01:22:28.347
I'm sorry. I never meant
for it to be published.

990
01:22:28.389 --> 01:22:31.016
I started that journal to
figure the shit out in my head.

991
01:22:31.058 --> 01:22:33.644
They asked me to read it
in group therapy, so I did.

992
01:22:33.686 --> 01:22:36.146
And one thing
just led to another.

993
01:22:36.188 --> 01:22:39.024
You accidentally wrote a book.

994
01:22:39.066 --> 01:22:40.901
I.

995
01:22:40.943 --> 01:22:43.070
I didn't mean
for this to happen this way.

996
01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:49.116
No one
wants to read this sick shit.

997
01:22:49.158 --> 01:22:50.827
I thought that too.

998
01:22:50.868 --> 01:22:53.955
But there's a bidding war
for my book.

999
01:22:55.748 --> 01:22:57.291
And that's why I'm in town.

1000
01:23:00.544 --> 01:23:01.962
You accidentally wrote a book

1001
01:23:02.004 --> 01:23:04.506
and then you shopped it
around to publishers

1002
01:23:04.548 --> 01:23:06.925
without asking me?

1003
01:23:06.967 --> 01:23:09.428
Fuck, this never
should have happened like this.

1004
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:11.262
No, no. It shouldn't have.

1005
01:23:11.304 --> 01:23:13.807
Tess, I hated myself.

1006
01:23:13.849 --> 01:23:16.476
I had to deal with that
every fucking day.

1007
01:23:16.517 --> 01:23:19.437
What is the point in everything
we've been through if we can't

1008
01:23:19.479 --> 01:23:21.772
channel that into something
that helps people?

1009
01:23:21.814 --> 01:23:24.900
I don't want people reading
about my life and judging me.

1010
01:23:24.942 --> 01:23:27.027
It's not your life, Tess.
It's our lives,

1011
01:23:27.069 --> 01:23:29.113
and it's a story
about forgiveness

1012
01:23:29.154 --> 01:23:31.115
and unconditional love.

1013
01:23:33.033 --> 01:23:35.619
It doesn't matter about
parents or addiction

1014
01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:38.538
or whatever fucked up past.
It's never too late.

1015
01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:40.040
People can always change.

1016
01:23:40.082 --> 01:23:42.417
That is the kind of story
"After" is.

1017
01:23:44.253 --> 01:23:45.462
"After"?

1018
01:23:46.713 --> 01:23:48.840
It's my journey
after I met you.

1019
01:23:50.717 --> 01:23:52.510
I think that journey is over.

1020
01:24:43.016 --> 01:24:45.143
Yes.

1021
01:24:45.185 --> 01:24:46.587
I didn't think
I'd ever come here.

1022
01:24:48.313 --> 01:24:51.316
I really thought
that I had hit rock bottom

1023
01:24:51.357 --> 01:24:53.902
and then I'd hit it again harder
and again and again,

1024
01:24:53.944 --> 01:24:56.029
and I burnt down
a fucking house.

1025
01:24:58.864 --> 01:25:01.617
And, uh, I guess... I guess
what I'm trying to say is

1026
01:25:01.659 --> 01:25:02.993
thank you all.

1027
01:25:04.287 --> 01:25:06.956
Because
when I walked in that door,

1028
01:25:06.997 --> 01:25:09.041
I. I didn't know
how this would go.

1029
01:25:09.083 --> 01:25:11.376
I didn't think it would work for me.
I never open up.

1030
01:25:11.418 --> 01:25:14.588
And somehow, you guys
have found a way to make me,

1031
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:17.007
and I'm grateful.

1032
01:25:17.049 --> 01:25:18.925
I mean this...
This really helped a lot.

1033
01:25:18.968 --> 01:25:21.303
I'd recommend it to anyone.

1034
01:25:21.345 --> 01:25:25.765
I feel like I'm actually
a better version of myself

1035
01:25:25.807 --> 01:25:31.145
and I haven't tried to
better myself ever, really.

1036
01:25:33.606 --> 01:25:35.149
So thank you.

1037
01:26:20.401 --> 01:26:24.112
It's been so nice
having you back in London.

1038
01:26:25.489 --> 01:26:27.282
I have something for you.

1039
01:26:30.201 --> 01:26:32.620
Look at this.

1040
01:26:33.663 --> 01:26:36.124
Your name.

1041
01:26:36.166 --> 01:26:38.418
I'm so proud of you.

1042
01:26:47.677 --> 01:26:49.011
I'm so sorry.

1043
01:26:49.053 --> 01:26:52.056
Mum, it's fine.
I've been going through so much.

1044
01:26:52.097 --> 01:26:53.974
No, but.

1045
01:26:54.016 --> 01:26:55.976
I didn't know what to do.

1046
01:26:56.018 --> 01:26:57.727
I was young, I was.

1047
01:27:00.021 --> 01:27:01.440
In love and I was terrified.

1048
01:27:02.899 --> 01:27:04.609
None of that excuses the fact

1049
01:27:04.651 --> 01:27:06.986
that I hid the truth from you
for so long.

1050
01:27:07.028 --> 01:27:08.237
But.

1051
01:27:10.573 --> 01:27:13.492
Everything I did,
every decision I made,

1052
01:27:13.534 --> 01:27:16.245
no matter how regrettable
looking back, it was.

1053
01:27:19.039 --> 01:27:21.041
It was done out of love for you.

1054
01:27:23.168 --> 01:27:24.378
I know it was, Mum.

1055
01:27:25.754 --> 01:27:27.255
And thank you for saying that.

1056
01:27:31.051 --> 01:27:32.010
It's good, all right?

1057
01:27:32.052 --> 01:27:34.012
This is amazing.

1058
01:27:36.348 --> 01:27:38.641
Checkout took forever.

1059
01:27:38.683 --> 01:27:42.395
Yes. Yes. No,
I'm on my way back now.

1060
01:27:56.367 --> 01:27:59.370
Sorry, yeah.

1061
01:27:59.411 --> 01:28:00.996
Yeah, I'll see you soon.

1062
01:28:04.791 --> 01:28:08.586
Hi. Look at you, so official.

1063
01:28:08.629 --> 01:28:13.549
Hi. You have to tell me
everything.

1064
01:28:13.591 --> 01:28:15.135
Hasn't been that long.

1065
01:28:17.637 --> 01:28:18.780
I think it's just since Landon

1066
01:28:18.804 --> 01:28:22.182
basically moved in
with Nora that.

1067
01:28:22.224 --> 01:28:23.809
You're starved for attention.

1068
01:28:23.851 --> 01:28:25.770
Mm. I thought
it would be easier

1069
01:28:25.811 --> 01:28:28.063
making friends at school.

1070
01:28:28.105 --> 01:28:31.566
Yeah. The campus
is pretty spread out, huh?

1071
01:28:31.608 --> 01:28:33.336
Yeah. And it's just
by the time you figure out

1072
01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:34.420
where to meet
and how to get there

1073
01:28:34.444 --> 01:28:35.820
on the subway and the buses,

1074
01:28:35.862 --> 01:28:38.031
it's like an hour
to do anything.

1075
01:28:38.072 --> 01:28:39.449
Welcome to New York.

1076
01:28:39.491 --> 01:28:41.868
So I hope
you like chicken alfredo.

1077
01:28:43.745 --> 01:28:44.829
- Er.
- What?

1078
01:28:44.871 --> 01:28:46.098
I should've mentioned this.
I'm...

1079
01:28:46.122 --> 01:28:47.516
I'm actually doing
the plant-based thing.

1080
01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:48.726
I don't know why I didn't ask.

1081
01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:49.793
I should have just asked.

1082
01:28:49.834 --> 01:28:51.103
No, no.
You know, let's improvise.

1083
01:28:51.127 --> 01:28:52.336
You got any red sauce?

1084
01:28:56.674 --> 01:28:58.426
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

1085
01:28:58.467 --> 01:29:00.135
Tessa. Tess. Hey.
I'm sorry.

1086
01:29:01.679 --> 01:29:03.263
Don't worry about it.

1087
01:29:03.305 --> 01:29:04.682
I'll order somethin' in.

1088
01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:09.019
You wanna try?

1089
01:29:09.061 --> 01:29:10.312
What is it?

1090
01:29:10.353 --> 01:29:12.022
Tofu curry dumpling.

1091
01:29:12.064 --> 01:29:13.231
Is it spicy?

1092
01:29:13.273 --> 01:29:14.732
Not... not. Just try it.

1093
01:29:14.774 --> 01:29:15.983
Okay.

1094
01:29:21.906 --> 01:29:23.115
- Yeah?
- Mm.

1095
01:29:24.784 --> 01:29:26.744
It's not... it's not bad.

1096
01:29:26.786 --> 01:29:27.829
But.?

1097
01:29:27.870 --> 01:29:28.996
It's not good.

1098
01:29:29.038 --> 01:29:30.832
Oh, come on.

1099
01:29:30.873 --> 01:29:32.624
So one of my classmates
invited us

1100
01:29:32.666 --> 01:29:34.835
to his girlfriend's
gallery opening

1101
01:29:34.876 --> 01:29:36.712
in the village tonight.
Mmhm.

1102
01:29:36.753 --> 01:29:39.089
Do you wanna go?

1103
01:29:39.130 --> 01:29:43.552
Um, yeah.
I mean, I'd love to but.

1104
01:29:43.594 --> 01:29:45.261
I've actually got this thing
tonight.

1105
01:29:45.303 --> 01:29:46.763
Can we do it another time?

1106
01:29:46.805 --> 01:29:49.349
Yeah. Of course.

1107
01:29:49.390 --> 01:29:51.601
Okay.

1108
01:29:55.646 --> 01:29:58.483
So after she kicked me out,

1109
01:29:58.524 --> 01:29:59.859
I really felt
that my entire world

1110
01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:02.069
was just crumbling around me.

1111
01:30:02.111 --> 01:30:03.571
I was afraid
I was going to spiral.

1112
01:30:04.989 --> 01:30:06.741
I really had
nothing going for me.

1113
01:30:08.658 --> 01:30:09.869
But then I got the call.

1114
01:30:11.661 --> 01:30:15.707
Dowless and Sons wanted the book
to release immediately.

1115
01:30:15.749 --> 01:30:19.336
So, I picked up the phone
and I called.

1116
01:30:19.378 --> 01:30:20.379
I called my therapist.

1117
01:30:23.131 --> 01:30:24.382
And I took a breath.

1118
01:30:26.342 --> 01:30:27.761
And I took the deal.

1119
01:30:29.262 --> 01:30:30.638
And here we are.

1120
01:30:47.946 --> 01:30:50.448
Anyway, I'll, uh,
I'll stop blithering on,

1121
01:30:50.490 --> 01:30:52.409
and I'll actually
read something.
