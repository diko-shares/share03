00:36:12.525 --> 00:36:14.401

- And cloves.
- And this.

You have, it appears,
a fine nose, young man, but...

365
00:36:44.389 --> 00:36:46.932
My nose knows all
the smells in the world.

366
00:36:47.058 --> 00:36:49.602
It's the best nose in Paris,
only I don't know the names.

You don't interrupt me

You are both impertinent
and insolent!

370
00:36:58.194 --> 00:37:01.072
Even I don't know every scent.

371
00:37:02.823 --> 00:37:04.950
I've known
for some time the ingredients

372
00:37:05.076 --> 00:37:08.037
of Amor and Psyche, but
all it needs to find that out

373
00:37:08.162 --> 00:37:11.999
is a passably fine nose,
nothing else.

374
00:37:12.124 --> 00:37:16.254
But it needs the craft
of a true perfumer

375
00:37:16.379 --> 00:37:18.673
to detect the exact formula.

376
00:37:18.798 --> 00:37:21.133

You see, you can't, can you?
And I'll tell you why.

384
00:37:44.906 --> 00:37:48.410
Because talent means

while experience acquired
in humility and hard work...

386
00:37:55.375 --> 00:37:57.127

387
00:38:00.922 --> 00:38:03.383
I don't know what a formula is.

388

But I can make Amor and Psyche

You shall have the opportunity now,

Your grandiose failure will also
be an opportunity for you

to learn the virtue of humility.

- How much do you want me to make?
- How much of what?

No! You shall not.

- Mm-hmm.

417
