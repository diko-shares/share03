1
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.260
Quick! We can't
hold him back much longer.

2
00:01:36.537 --> 00:01:37.748
Hurry!

3
00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:42.469
Come on!

4
00:01:50.512 --> 00:01:51.509
Quick!

5
00:01:56.563 --> 00:01:57.666
Faster!

6
00:02:10.782 --> 00:02:12.488
Up on the balcony!
Come on! Quickly!

7
00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:43.414
Just read them
the sentence!

8
00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:48.229
The sentence of the court...

9
00:02:48.555 --> 00:02:50.446
is that in two days hence...

10
00:02:50.964 --> 00:02:55.172
the perfumer journeyman:
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille...

11
00:02:55.782 --> 00:02:58.119
shall be bound
to a wooden cross...

12
00:02:58.317 --> 00:03:01.470
with his face raised
towards heaven!

13
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.191
And whilst still alive...

14
00:03:05.728 --> 00:03:09.591
be dealt twelve blows
with an iron rod...

15
00:03:12.002 --> 00:03:14.942
breaking the joints
of his arms...

16
00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:17.140
his shoulders...

17
00:03:17.934 --> 00:03:19.322
his hips...

18
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.811
his legs!

19
00:03:23.097 --> 00:03:27.332
He shall then be raised up
to hang until dead.

20
00:03:27.868 --> 00:03:31.164
And all customary acts of mercy...

21
00:03:31.276 --> 00:03:34.311
are expressly forbidden
the executioner.

22
00:03:43.324 --> 00:03:45.617
In 18th century France...

23
00:03:45.722 --> 00:03:51.881
there lived a man who was one of the most gifted
and notorious personages of his time.

24
00:03:52.342 --> 00:03:55.387
His name was
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.

25
00:03:56.118 --> 00:04:00.392
And if his name has been forgotten today,
it is for the sole reason...

26
00:04:00.435 --> 00:04:03.433
that his entire ambition
was restricted to a domain...

27
00:04:03.538 --> 00:04:07.343
that leaves no trace in history:

28
00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.953
to the fleeting realm of scent.

29
00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:19.764
PERFUME
The Story of a Murderer

30
00:04:27.728 --> 00:04:29.788
In the period of which we speak...

31
00:04:29.895 --> 00:04:35.648
there reigned in the cities a stench
barely conceivable to us modern men and women.

32
00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:39.869
Naturally, the stench
was foulest in Paris...

33
00:04:39.906 --> 00:04:42.974
for Paris was
the largest city in Europe.

34
00:04:43.443 --> 00:04:46.863
And nowhere in Paris was that stench
more profoundly repugnant...

35
00:04:46.968 --> 00:04:49.245
than in the city's fish market.

36
00:04:50.876 --> 00:04:54.296
Here we are.
I'll get another box.

37
00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.147
It was here then,
on the most putrid spot in the whole kingdom...

38
00:04:59.301 --> 00:05:01.882
that Jean-Baptiste Grenouille was born...

39
00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:04.797
on the 17th of July, 1738.

40
00:05:29.143 --> 00:05:31.117
It was his mother's fifth birth.

41
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.286
She delivered them all here
under her fish stand.

42
00:05:34.395 --> 00:05:37.050
And all had been stillbirths,
or semi-stillbirths.

43
00:05:37.231 --> 00:05:38.275
Are you alright?

44
00:05:39.266 --> 00:05:41.892
And by evening, the whole mess
had been shoveled away...

45
00:05:41.965 --> 00:05:43.759
with the fish guts
into the river.

46
00:05:44.543 --> 00:05:46.521
It would be much the same today...

47
00:05:47.343 --> 00:05:48.823
but then...

48
00:05:49.436 --> 00:05:52.369
Jean-Baptiste chose differently.

49
00:06:26.186 --> 00:06:27.390
What's that noise?

50
00:06:28.047 --> 00:06:29.926
It's... it's a baby.

51
00:06:29.927 --> 00:06:31.288
What's going on here?

52
00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:38.192
- It's a newborn.
- Where's his mother?

53
00:06:39.704 --> 00:06:40.963
She was just here.

54
00:06:43.543 --> 00:06:48.940
She tried to kill it, her own child.
She tried to kill a baby!

55
00:06:50.836 --> 00:06:52.501
There! There she is!

56
00:06:52.763 --> 00:06:55.334
- Stop! Stop where you are!
- Murderer!

57
00:06:55.422 --> 00:06:59.100
Thus, the first sound
to escape Grenouille's lips...

58
00:06:59.709 --> 00:07:01.457
sent his mother
to the gallows.

59
00:07:05.414 --> 00:07:08.072
And Jean-Baptiste,
by official order...

60
00:07:09.001 --> 00:07:11.386
to the orphange
of Madame Gaillard.

61
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.792
- How many today?
- Four, well... three and a half.

62
00:07:23.908 --> 00:07:29.538
- As usual, more dead than alive.
- Just take the money and sign!

63
00:07:36.762 --> 00:07:40.517
- Make room!
- Where?

64
00:07:40.555 --> 00:07:41.498
Move!

65
00:07:56.593 --> 00:07:57.914
Is he dead?

66
00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:28.648
- That's not staying in my bed.
- Let's throw it out then.

67
00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:32.685
- What if it screams?
- It's just a kiddie.

68
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.065
Harder! Push!

69
00:08:55.489 --> 00:08:57.781
What are you doing?

70
00:09:06.097 --> 00:09:06.998
For Madame Gaillard...

71
00:09:07.077 --> 00:09:10.249
Grenouille was a source of income
just like any other.

72
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:16.891
The children, however, sensed at once
that there was something different about him.

73
00:09:33.469 --> 00:09:38.039
By the age of five, Jean-Baptiste
still could not talk.

74
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:43.810
But he had been born with a talent
that made him unique among their kind.

75
00:10:46.797 --> 00:10:49.401
It was not that the other children
hated him...

76
00:10:50.228 --> 00:10:53.123
they felt unnerved
by him.

77
00:10:57.136 --> 00:11:01.304
Increasingly, he became aware
that his phenomenal sense of smell...

78
00:11:01.401 --> 00:11:03.852
was a gift that had been give to him...

79
00:11:04.244 --> 00:11:05.901
and him alone.

80
00:11:14.258 --> 00:11:17.713
When Jean-Baptiste did
finally learn to speak...

81
00:11:17.984 --> 00:11:20.130
he soon found
that everyday language...

82
00:11:20.307 --> 00:11:25.542
proved inadequate for all the olfactory experience
he's accumulating within himself.

83
00:11:29.946 --> 00:11:31.431
Wood.

84
00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:38.714
Warm wood.

85
00:11:40.091 --> 00:11:43.973
Grass... wet grass.

86
00:11:44.873 --> 00:11:48.352
Stones... warm stones.

87
00:11:51.283 --> 00:11:55.713
Water... cold water.

88
00:12:02.276 --> 00:12:03.480
Frog.

89
00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:07.855
Wet stones.

90
00:12:08.515 --> 00:12:12.219
Big wet frog stones.

91
00:12:13.856 --> 00:12:15.454
Something...

92
00:12:17.447 --> 00:12:20.496
something, something.

93
00:12:21.999 --> 00:12:26.868
By the age of thirteen, Madame Gaillard
no longer had room for Jean-Baptiste...

94
00:12:27.228 --> 00:12:28.755
and therefore decided
to sell him.

95
00:12:28.756 --> 00:12:29.966
Come on!

96
00:12:33.248 --> 00:12:34.412
Ten francs.

97
00:12:36.384 --> 00:12:39.613
From his first breath
of the odor enveloping this man...

98
00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:41.866
Seven, it's not worth so much.

99
00:12:42.196 --> 00:12:45.266
Grenouille knew that his life
in Grimal's tannery...

100
00:12:45.461 --> 00:12:46.987
would be worth precisely
as much...

101
00:12:47.114 --> 00:12:48.904
as the work
he could accomplish.

102
00:12:52.452 --> 00:12:54.319
Unfortunately for Madame Gaillard...

103
00:12:57.994 --> 00:13:00.846
the bargain was short-lived.

104
00:13:06.945 --> 00:13:10.468
Life expectancy in the tannery
was a mere five years.

105
00:13:11.112 --> 00:13:15.062
But Jean-Baptiste proved to be
as tough as a resilient bacterium.

106
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:17.651
He adjusted to
his new fate...

107
00:13:17.652 --> 00:13:20.791
and became a paragon
of docility and diligence...

108
00:13:21.108 --> 00:13:25.261
slaved 15, 16 hours a day,
summer and winter.

109
00:13:26.713 --> 00:13:31.233
Gradually, he became aware
of a world beyond the tannery...

110
00:13:32.263 --> 00:13:36.805
where utopia of unexplored smells
lay in store for him.

111
00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:02.363
Grenouille.

112
00:14:06.482 --> 00:14:09.649
Come with us.
I'm taking you to town for delivery.

113
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:15.186
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille
had triumphed. He was alive.

114
00:14:16.053 --> 00:14:19.172
And at last, he was in his element.

115
00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.242
He was not choosing.

116
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.647
He did not differentiate between
what is commonly considered to be...

117
00:15:03.696 --> 00:15:05.796
good smells from bad.

118
00:15:07.199 --> 00:15:10.072
At least, not yet.

119
00:15:12.438 --> 00:15:14.601
He was very greedy.

120
00:15:15.058 --> 00:15:16.998
The goal was to possess...

121
00:15:17.057 --> 00:15:20.571
everything the world had to offer
in the way of odors.

122
00:15:21.334 --> 00:15:25.455
His only condition being...
that they were new ones.

123
00:15:28.145 --> 00:15:31.911
Thousands upon thousands of odors
formed an invisible gruel...

124
00:15:32.058 --> 00:15:36.463
which he dissected into its
smallest and most remote parts of pieces.

125
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.580
Grenouille!

126
00:15:58.537 --> 00:16:00.067
Come on!

127
00:16:04.045 --> 00:16:05.785
Your ass over here.

128
00:17:20.131 --> 00:17:23.421
- What is it called?
- "Amor and Psyche", madame.

129
00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.332
My little creation.

130
00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:30.172
- May I try it?
- If you allow me, mademoiselle.

131
00:17:37.887 --> 00:17:40.405
Sheer heaven...

132
00:17:43.005 --> 00:17:47.068
Monsieur P¨¦lissier, you are
truly an artiste.

133
00:20:15.916 --> 00:20:17.183
What do you want?

134
00:20:26.312 --> 00:20:27.568
Want to buy some?

135
00:20:41.453 --> 00:20:42.777
Two for a sou.

136
00:26:55.717 --> 00:26:57.501
That's for you
running off like that.

137
00:26:58.311 --> 00:26:59.529
I'll kill you!

138
00:27:03.353 --> 00:27:06.182
That night, he could not sleep.

139
00:27:07.086 --> 00:27:11.742
The intoxicating power of the girls's scent
suddenly made it clear to him...

140
00:27:11.798 --> 00:27:16.123
why he had come to his own life
so tenaciously, so savagely.

141
00:27:17.796 --> 00:27:19.137
The meaning and purpose...

142
00:27:19.232 --> 00:27:22.262
of his miserable existence
had a higher destiny.

143
00:27:23.644 --> 00:27:26.523
He would learn
how to preserve scent...

144
00:27:26.747 --> 00:27:31.106
so that never again would he lose
such sublime beauty.

145
00:27:55.306 --> 00:27:58.991
There were about a dozen perfumers
in Paris in those days.

146
00:28:00.049 --> 00:28:04.583
One of them, the one celebrated
Italian perfumer, Giuseppe Baldini,

147
00:28:04.677 --> 00:28:06.756
had set up shop
in the center of the bridge,

148
00:28:06.825 --> 00:28:11.395
called "the Pont au Change" on his arrival
in Paris over thirty years ago.

149
00:28:12.142 --> 00:28:14.850
To be sure,
at one time in his youth,

150
00:28:15.036 --> 00:28:20.204
Baldini had created several truly great perfumes
to which he owed his fortune.

151
00:28:22.038 --> 00:28:26.728
But now, Baldini was out of touch,
out of fashion,

152
00:28:26.954 --> 00:28:31.087
and spent his days
waiting for customers that no longer came.

153
00:28:32.891 --> 00:28:34.852
- Ch¨¦nier! There you are!
- Monsieur Baldini.

154
00:28:34.853 --> 00:28:36.213
Put on your wig.

155
00:28:36.813 --> 00:28:38.289
Put on your wig!

156
00:28:40.748 --> 00:28:41.752
You going out?

157
00:28:42.581 --> 00:28:44.707
I will retire to my study
for a few hours,

158
00:28:44.909 --> 00:28:47.529
and do not want to be disturbed
under any circumstances.

159
00:28:47.637 --> 00:28:49.737
Will you be creating
a new perfume, Monsieur Baldini?

160
00:28:49.832 --> 00:28:52.132
Correct.
For Count Verhamont.

161
00:28:52.663 --> 00:28:55.092
He's asked for something like...

162
00:28:55.147 --> 00:28:59.206
I think he said it was called...
"Amor and Psyche"?

163
00:28:59.603 --> 00:29:01.959
That swindler in the
rue Saint-Andr¨¦-des-Arts.

164
00:29:02.313 --> 00:29:05.700
- P¨¦lissier.
- P¨¦lissier! That's him.

165
00:29:07.319 --> 00:29:08.709
"Amor and Psyche"ê.

166
00:29:13.645 --> 00:29:15.672
- Do you know it?
- Oh, yes.

167
00:29:15.759 --> 00:29:17.840
You can smell it everywhere
these days, monsieur.

168
00:29:18.795 --> 00:29:20.156
Every street corner.

169
00:29:21.714 --> 00:29:25.124
In fact, I just purchased
you a sample.

170
00:29:27.084 --> 00:29:28.867
In case you wanted
to test it.

171
00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:34.757
What on earth makes you think
I'd be interested in testing it?

172
00:29:36.517 --> 00:29:38.936
You're right.
It's nothing special.

173
00:29:39.576 --> 00:29:42.366
Actually, it's a very
common scent.

174
00:29:43.087 --> 00:29:46.136
I believe the head cord
contains lime oil.

175
00:29:47.911 --> 00:29:51.241
Really? And the heart cord?

176
00:29:51.921 --> 00:29:54.276
Orange blossom, I believe.

177
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:59.352
And civet in the base cord,
but I cannot say for sure.

178
00:29:59.522 --> 00:30:03.388
Well, I couldn't care less what that bungler
P¨¦lissier slops into his perfumes.

179
00:30:03.761 --> 00:30:05.077
Naturally not, monsieur.

180
00:30:05.625 --> 00:30:08.987
And I am thinking of creating something
for Count Verhamont...

181
00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:12.775
that will cause
a veritable sensation.

182
00:30:13.099 --> 00:30:14.948
I'm sure it will, Monsieur Baldini.

183
00:30:16.086 --> 00:30:20.258
Take charge of the shop, Ch¨¦nier.
And don't let anyone come near me.

184
00:30:20.378 --> 00:30:23.515
Inspiration requires
peace and tranquility.

185
00:30:24.686 --> 00:30:27.616
Vanessa! Bring me the handkerchiefs!

186
00:30:58.227 --> 00:30:59.693
Here are your handkerchiefs.

187
00:30:59.826 --> 00:31:02.530
Grazie... grazie... grazie!

188
00:31:05.434 --> 00:31:07.410
Is there anything else
you need?

189
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:10.290
Inspiration, perhaps.

190
00:31:10.563 --> 00:31:12.012
Come on, Giuseppe!

191
00:31:14.432 --> 00:31:17.560
You're still
the great perfumer Baldini.

192
00:32:11.282 --> 00:32:14.252
Bellissimo...
Wonderful...

193
00:32:18.345 --> 00:32:20.088
He did it again.

194
00:32:26.339 --> 00:32:29.508
Lime oil, yes indeed.

195
00:32:32.657 --> 00:32:35.838
Orange blossom, to be sure.

196
00:32:40.096 --> 00:32:42.193
And a hint of cloves, perhaps.

197
00:32:44.408 --> 00:32:45.511
No...

198
00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:48.744
Well, could be cinnamon.

199
00:32:51.205 --> 00:32:52.072
It's gone.

200
00:32:55.848 --> 00:32:57.027
Cinnamon.

201
00:32:57.951 --> 00:32:59.380
It's not cinnamon...

202
00:33:03.441 --> 00:33:04.430
Cloves.

203
00:33:04.961 --> 00:33:05.442
No...

204
00:33:06.403 --> 00:33:07.420
Musk?

205
00:33:07.637 --> 00:33:08.638
No.

206
00:33:49.329 --> 00:33:50.105
Who's there?

207
00:33:50.868 --> 00:33:52.411
I'm from Grimal's tannery.

208
00:33:56.141 --> 00:33:58.187
I've brought
the goatskins you ordered.

209
00:34:04.116 --> 00:34:05.356
Follow me.

210
00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:12.888
This way.

211
00:34:47.138 --> 00:34:49.978
There. Leave them there.

212
00:34:59.247 --> 00:35:01.037
Tell your master
the skins are fine.

213
00:35:01.579 --> 00:35:03.935
I'll come by the next few days
and pay for them.

214
00:35:05.133 --> 00:35:06.562
Yes, monsieur.

215
00:35:12.936 --> 00:35:15.944
You want to make this leather
smell good, don't you?

216
00:35:17.374 --> 00:35:22.703
- Why, of course.
- With "Amor and Psyche" by P¨¦lissier?

217
00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:30.747
Whatever gave you the absurb idea
I would use someone else's perfume?

218
00:35:31.931 --> 00:35:32.794
It's all over you.

219
00:35:33.285 --> 00:35:35.647
It's on your forehead,
your nose, your hands.

220
00:35:35.661 --> 00:35:40.665
It's bad, "Amor and Psyche" is, master.
There's too much rosemary in it, and too much of...

221
00:35:42.401 --> 00:35:44.637
that and that.

222
00:35:47.419 --> 00:35:51.062
Bergamot and patchouli.

223
00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.173
Pa...

224
00:35:53.026 --> 00:35:55.605
- Patchouli.
- Patchou...

225
00:36:00.906 --> 00:36:02.149
What else?

226
00:36:05.282 --> 00:36:06.820
That and that.

227
00:36:08.757 --> 00:36:10.027
That and that.

228
00:36:19.578 --> 00:36:21.077
Orange blossom.

229
00:36:22.727 --> 00:36:23.864
Lime.

230
00:36:25.254 --> 00:36:26.686
- Musk.
- Musk.

231
00:36:29.923 --> 00:36:31.570
And cloves.

232
00:36:31.898 --> 00:36:33.470
And this.

233
00:36:41.955 --> 00:36:44.794
- Storax?
- That's in it too.

234
00:36:44.871 --> 00:36:47.792
- Storax. Storax.
- Storax. Storax.

235
00:36:54.508 --> 00:36:57.267
You have, it appears,
a fine nose, young man. But...

236
00:36:57.328 --> 00:37:01.300
My nose knows all the smells in the world.
It's the best nose in Paris.

237
00:37:01.495 --> 00:37:03.843
Only I don't know the names.
I need to learn the names...

238
00:37:03.877 --> 00:37:05.775
- learn them all...
- No! No! No! Basta!

239
00:37:05.849 --> 00:37:07.677
You don't interrupt me when I'm speaking.

240
00:37:07.726 --> 00:37:10.073
You're both impertinent
and insolent!

241
00:37:11.073 --> 00:37:13.477
Even I don't know every scent.

242
00:37:15.707 --> 00:37:19.129
I, of course, know for some time
the ingredients of "Amor and Psyche".

243
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:23.233
But all it needs to find that out
is a passably fine nose, nothing else.

244
00:37:25.294 --> 00:37:28.647
But it needs the craft
of a true perfumer...

245
00:37:29.513 --> 00:37:31.382
to detect the exact formula.

246
00:37:31.838 --> 00:37:36.425
Which notes, which cords.
And in what precise measurements.

247
00:37:37.899 --> 00:37:41.021
Could you tell me the exact formula
of "Amor and Psyche"ê?

248
00:37:43.795 --> 00:37:45.470
"Best nose in Paris".

249
00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:52.425
Speak up!

250
00:37:53.347 --> 00:37:56.540
You see, you can't, can you?
And I'll tell you why.

251
00:37:57.842 --> 00:38:00.485
Because talent means
next to nothing!

252
00:38:02.713 --> 00:38:05.319
While experience, acquired in humility...

253
00:38:05.852 --> 00:38:09.267
and hard work, means everything.

254
00:38:13.706 --> 00:38:16.283
I don't, I don't know
what a formula is.

255
00:38:16.493 --> 00:38:19.443
But I can make
"Amor and Psyche" for you now.

256
00:38:20.787 --> 00:38:23.991
And you think I'll just let you
slop around in my laboratory...

257
00:38:24.097 --> 00:38:26.072
with essential oils
that are worth a fortune?

258
00:38:26.422 --> 00:38:27.372
You?

259
00:38:28.525 --> 00:38:31.044
- Yes.
- Now pay attention!

260
00:38:34.434 --> 00:38:35.902
What is your name, anyway?

261
00:38:37.941 --> 00:38:39.695
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.

262
00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:45.039
Very well, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.

263
00:38:46.867 --> 00:38:50.282
You shall have the opportunity now,
this very moment, to prove your assertion.

264
00:38:50.338 --> 00:38:53.505
Your grandiose failure will also be
an opportunity for you to learn...

265
00:38:53.553 --> 00:38:56.879
- the virture of humility.
- How much do you want me to make?

266
00:38:56.932 --> 00:39:00.465
- How much of... what?
- How much "Amor and Psyche" do you want?

267
00:39:03.283 --> 00:39:07.275
- Shall I fill this flask?
- No! You shall not!

268
00:39:16.635 --> 00:39:19.308
- You may fill this one.
- Yes, master.

269
00:39:22.352 --> 00:39:24.572
- But, Master Baldini,
- Hmm?

270
00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:27.602
you must let me do it
in my own way.

271
00:39:28.071 --> 00:39:29.914
As you please.

272
00:39:36.411 --> 00:39:38.746
Don't drop that!
That's pure alcohol!

273
00:39:38.821 --> 00:39:41.054
You want to blow up
the entire building?

274
00:39:43.601 --> 00:39:45.300
You have to measure it first!

275
00:40:34.322 --> 00:40:37.776
Stop! Stop it!
That's enough! Basta!

276
00:40:38.176 --> 00:40:39.463
You know nothing!

277
00:40:39.955 --> 00:40:44.646
Essential oils are always to be
mixed first, then the alcohol added.

278
00:40:44.703 --> 00:40:47.963
And never ever let this perfume
to be shaken like that.

279
00:40:48.261 --> 00:40:51.583
I must've been insane
to listen to your asinine gibberish.

280
00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.146
Yes, we're done.

281
00:41:25.001 --> 00:41:26.700
Mamamiya...

282
00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:43.436
This is "Amor and Psyche".

283
00:41:44.277 --> 00:41:46.626
But it's not a good perfume, master.

284
00:41:48.205 --> 00:41:51.701
If you let me again, master,
I'll make it more better.

285
00:43:06.771 --> 00:43:09.006
That's a really good perfume.

286
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:18.109
Don't you want
to smell it, master?

287
00:43:18.162 --> 00:43:19.993
I'm not in the mood
to test it now.

288
00:43:20.044 --> 00:43:22.852
I have other things
on my mind. Go now.

289
00:43:24.719 --> 00:43:27.252
- But, master...
- Go now!

290
00:43:42.518 --> 00:43:45.541
Can't I come to work
for you, master, can't I?

291
00:43:47.744 --> 00:43:49.895
- Let me think about it.
- Master!

292
00:43:51.577 --> 00:43:54.709
I have to learn
how to keep smell.

293
00:43:56.199 --> 00:44:00.597
- What?
- Can you teach me that?

294
00:44:01.136 --> 00:44:03.412
I shall have to think
about it. Now go.

295
00:44:49.811 --> 00:44:51.390
I love you.

296
00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:00.467
I'll give you 50 francs for him.

297
00:45:07.821 --> 00:45:09.447
Grenouille!

298
00:45:09.491 --> 00:45:13.350
Grimal's transaction had
a profound effect on all three parties.

299
00:45:13.411 --> 00:45:14.475
Hey, watch out!

300
00:45:18.197 --> 00:45:21.315
Now at least, upon
Monsieur Grimal himself.

301
00:45:24.194 --> 00:45:25.968
As for Giuseppe Baldini,

302
00:45:26.039 --> 00:45:30.755
the acquisition of Grenouille miraculously
transformed his dwindling business,

303
00:45:30.823 --> 00:45:33.771
even surpassing
its former glory.

304
00:45:41.825 --> 00:45:43.969
While at last, for Jean-Baptiste,

305
00:45:44.296 --> 00:45:49.062
the mysterious secret
of the perfumers' craft began to unfold.

306
00:45:55.433 --> 00:45:58.020
Now, pay careful attention
to what I tell you.

307
00:45:58.072 --> 00:45:59.603
Just like a musical cord,

308
00:45:59.664 --> 00:46:03.578
a perfume cord contains
four essences, or notes,

309
00:46:03.639 --> 00:46:06.900
carefully selected
for their harmonic affinity.

310
00:46:06.959 --> 00:46:12.427
Each perfume contains three cords:
the head, the heart and the base,

311
00:46:12.465 --> 00:46:15.124
necessitating twelve notes in all.

312
00:46:15.745 --> 00:46:18.771
The head cord contains
the first impression,

313
00:46:18.831 --> 00:46:22.443
lasting only a few minutes,
before giving way to the heart cord:

314
00:46:22.504 --> 00:46:26.255
the theme of the perfume,
lasting several hours.

315
00:46:26.294 --> 00:46:29.029
Finally, the base cord:

316
00:46:29.362 --> 00:46:33.211
the trail of the perfume,
lasting several days.

317
00:46:37.614 --> 00:46:42.587
Mind you, the ancient Egyptians believed
that one can only create a truly original perfume...

318
00:46:42.655 --> 00:46:49.297
by adding an extra note,
one final essence that will ring out...

319
00:46:49.808 --> 00:46:52.058
and dominate the others.

320
00:46:54.329 --> 00:46:58.919
Legend has it that a jar
was once found in a pharaoh's tomb.

321
00:46:59.024 --> 00:47:02.697
And when it was opened,
a perfume was released.

322
00:47:02.822 --> 00:47:05.846
After all those thousands of years,

323
00:47:05.909 --> 00:47:09.982
a perfume of such subtle beauty,
and yet such power,

324
00:47:10.076 --> 00:47:13.017
that for one single moment,

325
00:47:13.075 --> 00:47:17.686
every single person on earth
believed they were in paradise.

326
00:47:19.376 --> 00:47:22.176
Twelve essences
could be identified.

327
00:47:23.201 --> 00:47:27.056
But the thirteenth,
the vital one...

328
00:47:28.577 --> 00:47:30.762
could never be determined.

329
00:47:32.548 --> 00:47:33.396
Why not?

330
00:47:35.905 --> 00:47:36.511
Why not?

331
00:47:36.743 --> 00:47:38.342
What do you mean why not?

332
00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:42.155
Because it's a legend, numskull.

333
00:47:43.443 --> 00:47:44.646
What's a legend?

334
00:47:47.327 --> 00:47:48.283
Never mind.

335
00:48:30.595 --> 00:48:33.136
Jean-Baptiste. Jean-Baptiste.

336
00:48:38.997 --> 00:48:40.283
What's the matter?

337
00:48:40.861 --> 00:48:44.796
I... I have to learn
how to capture a scent.

338
00:48:47.475 --> 00:48:48.985
What are you talking about?

339
00:48:49.502 --> 00:48:54.255
I have to learn how... how to
capture a scent and "reprose" it forever.

340
00:48:54.511 --> 00:48:57.651
- You mean "preserve".
- Yes, teach me that.

341
00:48:58.017 --> 00:49:01.553
Calm down, my boy.
Calm down.

342
00:49:02.137 --> 00:49:03.744
We have work to do.

343
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:10.914
The soul of beings is their scent.
You said that, master.

344
00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.202
Did I?

345
00:49:13.675 --> 00:49:17.700
I will make as many perfumes as you want.
But you have to teach me...

346
00:49:17.967 --> 00:49:20.655
how to capture
the smell of all things.

347
00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:23.456
Can you do that?

348
00:49:24.857 --> 00:49:29.374
- Well, naturally.
- Then teach me everything you know.

349
00:49:32.705 --> 00:49:35.258
And I'll make you the best perfumer
in the whole world.

350
00:49:53.161 --> 00:49:55.110
Imagine, Jean-Baptiste:

351
00:49:55.170 --> 00:50:01.799
ten thousand roses to produce
one single ounce of essential oil.

352
00:50:03.635 --> 00:50:09.774
Now, keep them flowing,
for the bottom petals will be given to stew,

353
00:50:10.022 --> 00:50:11.679
while I set up the alembic.

354
00:50:11.725 --> 00:50:13.593
And take care.
Not to damage them.

355
00:50:13.864 --> 00:50:17.755
We have to let them go to
their deaths with their scent intact.

356
00:50:36.285 --> 00:50:39.781
Perfect! Now, help me
with the boiler set.

357
00:50:53.174 --> 00:50:56.625
Temperature is vital.
When the quicksilver is here,

358
00:50:56.705 --> 00:51:01.600
the heat is precisely correct,
and the oil will gradually rise.

359
00:51:03.006 --> 00:51:08.596
Note that this mechanism is
a remarkable invention of my own devising.

360
00:51:09.163 --> 00:51:15.072
You will observe how cold water
is pumped through here,

361
00:51:15.729 --> 00:51:20.786
allowing the essence
to condense here...

362
00:51:20.844 --> 00:51:22.788
until it finally...

363
00:51:24.002 --> 00:51:25.354
appears...

364
00:51:26.894 --> 00:51:28.202
here!

365
00:51:29.182 --> 00:51:35.543
Of course, out on the hillside above Grasse,
we had only to bellow pure fresh air.

366
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:39.711
Ah, Grasse! What a town.

367
00:51:41.765 --> 00:51:47.417
The Rome of scents.
The Promised Land of perfume.

368
00:51:48.818 --> 00:51:53.335
No man can rightly
call himself a perfumer,

369
00:51:53.696 --> 00:51:58.057
unless he has proved his worth
in that hallowed place.

370
00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:03.207
Not to worry!
It happens all the time.

371
00:52:04.848 --> 00:52:06.556
To Grasse.

372
00:52:24.524 --> 00:52:25.621
Master.

373
00:52:26.852 --> 00:52:27.867
Look.

374
00:52:33.289 --> 00:52:35.760
The very soul of the rose.

375
00:53:29.962 --> 00:53:31.681
Jean-Baptiste.

376
00:53:34.643 --> 00:53:35.663
What's wrong?

377
00:53:37.155 --> 00:53:38.587
Jean-Baptiste.

378
00:53:41.749 --> 00:53:44.654
- What have you done?
- You lied.

379
00:53:45.006 --> 00:53:48.242
- What?
- You lied to me.

380
00:53:48.873 --> 00:53:51.746
How dare you
talk to me like that!

381
00:53:53.217 --> 00:53:55.935
You said I could capture
the scent of anything.

382
00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:58.185
And so you can!

383
00:54:02.233 --> 00:54:03.479
What do you smell?

384
00:54:04.721 --> 00:54:06.179
What do you smell?

385
00:54:11.622 --> 00:54:12.330
Nothing.

386
00:54:15.877 --> 00:54:19.339
- What were you expecting to smell?
- Glass.

387
00:54:20.055 --> 00:54:24.134
- But glass doesn't smell.
- Of course it does. What's this?

388
00:54:29.407 --> 00:54:30.986
I don't smell a thing.

389
00:54:31.843 --> 00:54:32.564
Basta!

390
00:54:32.618 --> 00:54:35.006
- Did you smell that copper?
- Enough!

391
00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:41.698
You were trying to distil
the smell of copper?

392
00:54:42.219 --> 00:54:43.091
iron...

393
00:54:43.146 --> 00:54:44.152
glass...

394
00:54:44.635 --> 00:54:45.951
copper...

395
00:54:49.613 --> 00:54:51.331
What else did you try?

396
00:54:55.252 --> 00:54:56.041
No!

397
00:54:58.324 --> 00:55:00.354
Have you gone completely insane?!

398
00:55:01.339 --> 00:55:03.465
You told me I had to experiment.

399
00:55:03.752 --> 00:55:08.946
Experiment? Experiment?
With a cat?!

400
00:55:12.151 --> 00:55:14.056
What kind of a human being are youê é?

401
00:55:14.696 --> 00:55:16.319
Don't you know anything?

402
00:55:16.661 --> 00:55:18.900
You can no more distil
the scent of a cat...

403
00:55:18.956 --> 00:55:21.464
than you can distil
the scent of you and me!

404
00:55:32.429 --> 00:55:35.326
- I can't?
- Of course not!

405
00:55:42.571 --> 00:55:44.263
He's in stadio ultimo.

406
00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:45.836
- What?
- He's dying.

407
00:55:45.894 --> 00:55:47.452
Is there nothing you can do?

408
00:55:48.002 --> 00:55:51.188
- I fear not.
- No! He cannot die.

409
00:55:51.247 --> 00:55:55.315
- Well, the fee is 50 francs.
- 50 francs? You're a charlatan!

410
00:56:01.298 --> 00:56:05.469
Oh dear, Jean-Baptiste!

411
00:56:06.597 --> 00:56:10.835
You cannot do this to me.
Please, don't die on me.

412
00:56:11.185 --> 00:56:13.511
Not now, not yet!

413
00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:27.257
Is there...

414
00:56:31.055 --> 00:56:33.083
any other way...

415
00:56:34.434 --> 00:56:37.375
to preserve smell
besides distil it?

416
00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:39.609
Jean-Baptiste...

417
00:56:44.579 --> 00:56:50.713
- Is there, master?
- Well, yes, I... I believe there is.

418
00:56:52.183 --> 00:56:54.143
What is ité?

419
00:56:55.974 --> 00:57:00.101
It is known as
the mysterious art of Enfleurage.

420
00:57:02.594 --> 00:57:04.277
Can you teach me?

421
00:57:07.416 --> 00:57:10.742
Not even I am intimate
with the secrets.

422
00:57:13.513 --> 00:57:16.032
But could I learn it in Grasse?

423
00:57:17.186 --> 00:57:20.051
- Well...
- Could I?

424
00:57:26.036 --> 00:57:29.325
Where else but in Grasse!

425
00:57:35.178 --> 00:57:37.585
Within a week, Grenouille was well again.

426
00:57:37.951 --> 00:57:40.729
But in order to travel to Grasse,
and find a job,

427
00:57:40.773 --> 00:57:43.441
he needed a journeyman's papers.

428
00:57:43.688 --> 00:57:45.581
Baldini agreed to provide them,

429
00:57:45.922 --> 00:57:51.873
on condition that Grenouille left him
not less than 100 formulas for new perfumes.

430
00:57:52.707 --> 00:57:56.977
Grenouille did not mind.
He could've given him a thousand.

431
00:58:02.537 --> 00:58:06.606
The morning of Grenouille's departure,
Baldini was pleased.

432
00:58:07.069 --> 00:58:11.178
At last, he felt rewarded
for his many years of hard work.

433
00:58:11.721 --> 00:58:14.937
He could not remember
a happier day.

434
00:58:15.144 --> 00:58:18.066
Deeply satisfied, he went
back to sleep...

435
00:58:18.571 --> 00:58:21.661
and awoke no more
in this life.

436
00:58:40.715 --> 00:58:45.651
With every step Grenouille took away
from the city, the happier he felt.

437
00:58:46.118 --> 00:58:51.033
The air above him grew
clearer, purer, cleaner.

438
00:58:51.168 --> 00:58:54.373
And at last, he was
able to breathe freely.

439
00:58:57.874 --> 00:59:00.573
There were two ways
to reach Grasse.

440
00:59:00.784 --> 00:59:04.446
The first followed the winding road
through the villages...

441
00:59:04.447 --> 00:59:07.582
while the second lay straight across
the hills and mountains,

442
00:59:07.643 --> 00:59:09.842
down into Provence.

443
00:59:10.878 --> 00:59:13.240
The choice was quite easy.

444
00:59:17.122 --> 00:59:22.157
Thus, his nose led him ever higher,
ever further from mankind.

445
00:59:22.577 --> 00:59:28.140
Ever more towards the magnetic pole
of the greatest possible solitude.

446
01:00:06.881 --> 01:00:08.312
Grenouille needed a moment...

447
01:00:08.366 --> 01:00:11.411
to believe that he had actually
found a spot on earth...

448
01:00:11.447 --> 01:00:14.388
where scent was almost absent.

449
01:00:19.604 --> 01:00:20.866
Spread all around...

450
01:00:20.932 --> 01:00:24.143
lay nothing but the tranquil
scent of dead stone.

451
01:00:27.473 --> 01:00:30.683
There was something
sacred about this place.

452
01:00:34.348 --> 01:00:37.065
No longer distracted
by anything external,

453
01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:42.571
he was finally able
to bask in his own existence.

454
01:00:44.044 --> 01:00:47.379
And found it splendid!

455
01:00:54.627 --> 01:00:59.066
After a while, he almost forgot
his plans and obsessions.

456
01:01:00.448 --> 01:01:04.096
And indeed,
might've done so altogether.

457
01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:20.318
Helloá.

458
01:01:24.432 --> 01:01:25.849
Helloá.

459
01:01:28.597 --> 01:01:30.108
Helloá.

460
01:01:47.622 --> 01:01:50.470
There were a thousand smells
in his clothes.

461
01:01:50.535 --> 01:01:53.573
The smell of sand, stone, moss...

462
01:01:53.613 --> 01:01:56.254
even the smell of the sausage
he'd eaten weeks ago.

463
01:01:56.744 --> 01:01:59.220
Only one smell was not there:

464
01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.038
His own.

465
01:02:41.083 --> 01:02:43.753
For the first time in his life,
Grenouille realized...

466
01:02:43.815 --> 01:02:46.421
that he had no smell of his own.

467
01:02:47.742 --> 01:02:49.291
He realized that all his life...

468
01:02:49.371 --> 01:02:51.820
he had been a nobody
to everyone.

469
01:02:53.066 --> 01:02:56.902
What he now felt
was the fear of his own oblivion.

470
01:02:57.616 --> 01:02:59.306
It was as though...

471
01:02:59.479 --> 01:03:01.436
he did not exist.

472
01:03:06.837 --> 01:03:11.160
By the first light of next morning,
Grenouille had a new plan.

473
01:03:11.566 --> 01:03:14.499
He must continue
his journey to Grasse.

474
01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:18.375
There he would teach the world
not only that he existed...

475
01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:20.146
that he was someone...

476
01:03:20.488 --> 01:03:23.098
but that he was exceptional.

477
01:03:27.144 --> 01:03:28.865
And with this decision,

478
01:03:29.284 --> 01:03:33.563
it seemed that the gods
had at last begun to smile on him.

479
01:08:01.056 --> 01:08:02.375
Laura?

480
01:08:10.076 --> 01:08:11.363
Laura?

481
01:08:12.174 --> 01:08:14.014
Coming, papa.

482
01:08:50.605 --> 01:08:52.971
Haven't seen you here before.

483
01:08:54.514 --> 01:08:56.255
It's my first season.

484
01:08:57.744 --> 01:08:59.903
Picking together
is always more fun.

485
01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:03.539
They say you pick
everything you find.

486
01:09:48.001 --> 01:09:52.097
Idiot! How many times do I told you
not to cram the blossoms in...

487
01:09:52.135 --> 01:09:53.894
like you're stuffing a chicken?

488
01:09:55.428 --> 01:09:57.195
Watch how Grenouille does it.

489
01:09:59.251 --> 01:10:03.361
Look how skillfully he handles them.
The whole art of Enflourage...

490
01:10:03.401 --> 01:10:07.491
is to allow the flowers to die slowly,
in their sleep as it were...

491
01:10:07.833 --> 01:10:12.789
handle them as you would a lady.
Wouldn't you agree with me, Druot?

492
01:10:13.256 --> 01:10:15.107
If you say so, madame.

493
01:10:17.736 --> 01:10:20.434
You! Check the jonquil blossoms.

494
01:10:23.966 --> 01:10:25.633
It need more time.

495
01:10:28.227 --> 01:10:30.006
Do what I say.

496
01:11:14.202 --> 01:11:15.452
Stop it!

497
01:11:16.387 --> 01:11:17.781
I'm not in the mood.

498
01:11:18.217 --> 01:11:19.455
Are you sure?

499
01:11:20.461 --> 01:11:22.164
Of course I'm sure.

500
01:11:28.479 --> 01:11:30.094
I said...

501
01:11:32.751 --> 01:11:34.241
"no".

502
01:11:45.446 --> 01:11:47.174
Suit yourself.

503
01:11:50.434 --> 01:11:51.933
Lucien?

504
01:11:55.255 --> 01:11:58.149
- Fetch me by the ladder!
- Fetch it yourself!

505
01:12:10.214 --> 01:12:11.682
Lucien?

506
01:12:14.919 --> 01:12:16.391
Lucien!

507
01:12:27.269 --> 01:12:28.547
Lucien?

508
01:12:31.725 --> 01:12:33.205
Lucien?

509
01:12:51.879 --> 01:12:53.348
Lucien.

510
01:13:50.628 --> 01:13:51.705
Tuberoses.

511
01:13:52.116 --> 01:13:55.003
For Madame Arnulfi.
She hereá?

512
01:13:58.561 --> 01:13:59.433
She's busy.

513
01:14:07.367 --> 01:14:09.773
Seem such a waste to boil them!

514
01:14:10.891 --> 01:14:13.259
Or whatever you do with them.

515
01:14:18.201 --> 01:14:20.923
So, what do you do with them?

516
01:14:21.393 --> 01:14:25.270
- Warm them in animal fat.
- What for?

517
01:14:25.547 --> 01:14:28.027
The fat soaks up
their scent.

518
01:14:28.177 --> 01:14:29.477
Then what?

519
01:14:31.662 --> 01:14:35.402
Then I cool it
toward pomade, and...

520
01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:39.845
and then I filter it, before...

521
01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:45.215
Before what?

522
01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:48.704
Before adding alcohol and other essences
to make perfume.

523
01:14:48.714 --> 01:14:51.032
Don't touch anything!

524
01:14:56.481 --> 01:14:57.631
What's in there?

525
01:14:59.201 --> 01:15:00.763
Nothing, just flowers.

526
01:15:01.304 --> 01:15:02.523
- Can I look?
- No.

527
01:15:03.161 --> 01:15:05.485
Not now, I've got work to do.
You must go now.

528
01:15:05.511 --> 01:15:08.353
- Ah, come on, let me look.
- Don't touch!

529
01:15:11.427 --> 01:15:13.900
- Morning, madame.
- Morning.

530
01:15:17.376 --> 01:15:19.994
Why do you cover the tank?

531
01:15:21.133 --> 01:15:24.134
It's an experiment, madame, to...

532
01:15:24.552 --> 01:15:28.188
to... protect the blossoms
from daylight,

533
01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:30.311
to preserve the scent better.

534
01:15:31.507 --> 01:15:33.696
Well, if you say so.

535
01:15:35.164 --> 01:15:38.866
Come with me.
I'll settle your master's account.

536
01:15:40.942 --> 01:15:43.465
To preserve their scent better, you say?

537
01:15:57.772 --> 01:15:59.323
I don't smell much.

538
01:16:05.661 --> 01:16:09.793
No. Then my experiment
was a failure.

539
01:16:13.107 --> 01:16:16.331
Make sure it's your time
you're wasting, not ours.

540
01:16:28.982 --> 01:16:30.745
How much must I pay?

541
01:16:32.923 --> 01:16:34.699
To be with youê.

542
01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:36.956
Depends what you want.

543
01:16:51.305 --> 01:16:52.759
What's that stuff?

544
01:16:56.022 --> 01:16:57.871
I'm creating a perfume.

545
01:17:01.075 --> 01:17:02.432
Lie down, please.

546
01:17:22.351 --> 01:17:23.783
They feels horrible.

547
01:17:24.993 --> 01:17:28.695
It's only animal fat.
To soak up your scent.

548
01:17:29.586 --> 01:17:31.959
Creating a perfume, mate?

549
01:17:32.145 --> 01:17:33.055
Come on, admit it.

550
01:17:33.142 --> 01:17:35.570
You're getting some sorta
bang out of this, aren't you?

551
01:17:36.250 --> 01:17:37.640
Aren't you?

552
01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:40.419
I enjoy my work.

553
01:17:42.007 --> 01:17:43.801
Keep your arm still.

554
01:17:51.441 --> 01:17:53.236
Don't think you're
gonna tie me up.

555
01:17:54.468 --> 01:17:56.437
Hold out your arm, please.

556
01:18:04.511 --> 01:18:06.495
I've come across
some strange men in my time...

557
01:18:06.498 --> 01:18:10.015
Just... relax!

558
01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:19.342
Holy Mother! What's that?

559
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:25.272
- Just scraping off the fat.
- Are you mad?

560
01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:28.374
I said relax!
You'll ruin everything.

561
01:18:28.971 --> 01:18:32.813
Your frighten just stink,
your perfume will be spoiled.

562
01:18:32.961 --> 01:18:34.178
I've had enough!

563
01:18:35.493 --> 01:18:38.461
Get out!
Here, take your money!

564
01:18:39.095 --> 01:18:42.268
Baste me with all these goo.
What do you think I am? A Christmas goose?

565
01:18:42.735 --> 01:18:44.360
Get out of here!

566
01:22:10.764 --> 01:22:13.759
Quickly! Blow them out
before the roses melt.

567
01:22:14.271 --> 01:22:16.555
- Roses can't melt, papa.
- These ones can.

568
01:22:31.688 --> 01:22:35.587
Now I'd like to propose a toast
to our guest of honor...

569
01:22:36.375 --> 01:22:38.621
His Excellency, the Marquis de Montesquieu.

570
01:22:39.278 --> 01:22:41.697
May our trade continue to flourish!

571
01:22:47.226 --> 01:22:49.001
I thank you all...

572
01:22:49.277 --> 01:22:51.953
and will ask of you the honor
to be the first to...

573
01:22:52.147 --> 01:22:54.497
offer my congratulations
to your beautiful daughter.

574
01:22:54.727 --> 01:22:57.536
And present her with
a small token of my affection.

575
01:23:23.610 --> 01:23:27.019
- I'm overwhelmed, Your Grace.
- Your Grace?

576
01:23:28.074 --> 01:23:30.935
I had hoped that it would be
on more familiar terms by now.

577
01:23:34.575 --> 01:23:38.687
- Let's have a game of hide-and-seek!
- Oh, yes! But everyone must play.

578
01:23:41.566 --> 01:23:43.180
Men catch the women.

579
01:23:45.461 --> 01:23:47.421
Bravo! Bravo!

580
01:23:50.558 --> 01:23:52.330
Albine, wait!

581
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:27.397
No!

582
01:25:21.942 --> 01:25:24.421
Put me down, please!

583
01:25:29.233 --> 01:25:31.086
Now there's no escape.

584
01:26:01.111 --> 01:26:03.034
Game's over, everybody!

585
01:26:05.712 --> 01:26:06.653
Laura!

586
01:26:08.528 --> 01:26:10.510
Time to go in now!

587
01:26:34.365 --> 01:26:35.778
Laura.

588
01:26:53.943 --> 01:26:56.471
Albine! Fran?oise!

589
01:27:02.284 --> 01:27:04.808
Laura, have you seen the twins?

590
01:27:05.215 --> 01:27:07.302
No, not since the game started.

591
01:27:09.864 --> 01:27:11.914
Albine. Fran?oise.

592
01:27:23.042 --> 01:27:28.488
- Albine! Fran?oise!
- Jacques, take this way.

593
01:27:29.692 --> 01:27:30.794
You two, go with me.

594
01:27:30.933 --> 01:27:34.977
Your Excellency, through here.

595
01:28:53.359 --> 01:28:56.222
I've told that cretin ten times
to get these ready.

596
01:28:56.865 --> 01:28:58.424
Don't keep picking on the boy.

597
01:28:59.518 --> 01:29:02.334
I'll kill the useless little sewer rat!

598
01:29:02.766 --> 01:29:06.083
Grenouille! What are you doing?

599
01:29:06.676 --> 01:29:08.923
Why aren't the enfleurage frames...

600
01:29:15.935 --> 01:29:17.872
- Yes, master?
- I mean...

601
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:21.740
would you be good enough to prepare
the enfleurage frames, Jean-Baptiste?

602
01:29:25.272 --> 01:29:27.322
Certainly, master.

603
01:29:37.639 --> 01:29:38.744
Hey, look!

604
01:29:40.517 --> 01:29:42.923
Sweet... There!

605
01:29:43.241 --> 01:29:45.847
A curfew? Are you mad?

606
01:29:46.194 --> 01:29:49.103
Jasmine can only be picked
before dawn. We all know that!

607
01:29:49.464 --> 01:29:52.454
This could mean the ruin
of our trade!

608
01:29:52.695 --> 01:29:55.786
Yours! And yours, and yours!

609
01:29:57.186 --> 01:29:59.478
Supposing it's your daughter
next time?

610
01:30:01.284 --> 01:30:03.741
Of course, a curfew is necessary.

611
01:30:03.836 --> 01:30:05.175
But we also have to catch this man.

612
01:30:05.230 --> 01:30:07.940
And the only way to do that
is to understand how he thinks!

613
01:30:08.416 --> 01:30:11.472
- What he wants!
- I should've thought that was obvious.

614
01:30:11.883 --> 01:30:13.698
Use your imagination!

615
01:30:13.753 --> 01:30:16.002
And if I were to tell you
that all except the prostitute...

616
01:30:16.092 --> 01:30:18.995
went to their graves
with their chastity intact?

617
01:30:19.808 --> 01:30:23.053
- How would you know?
- The coroner had each girl examined.

618
01:30:23.330 --> 01:30:25.157
They were all found
to be virgins.

619
01:30:27.333 --> 01:30:29.886
Supposing there isn't
a next time...

620
01:30:29.985 --> 01:30:34.067
if we introduce a curfew,
we may all go bankrupt for nothing.

621
01:30:36.277 --> 01:30:40.695
So we wait until he's killed what...
Six? Seven? Eight?

622
01:31:06.247 --> 01:31:08.518
Curfew! Go back to your homes!

623
01:31:09.851 --> 01:31:12.054
- What's happening?
- It's a curfew. Back to your home.

624
01:31:24.069 --> 01:31:26.527
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

625
01:31:27.331 --> 01:31:31.253
We have to face the fact
that our police are helpless in this matter.

626
01:31:31.610 --> 01:31:36.388
- I suggest that we ask for support from Paris.
- Paris won't be smarter than we are.

627
01:31:36.435 --> 01:31:40.820
Arrest every Gypsy and beggar!
And every man without a wife and family!

628
01:31:40.909 --> 01:31:42.568
Listen!

629
01:31:44.406 --> 01:31:48.009
We have to put ourselves
inside the mind of this man.

630
01:31:48.937 --> 01:31:53.266
Each of his victims
had an especial beauty.

631
01:31:53.917 --> 01:31:55.376
We know he doesn't want
their virginity.

632
01:31:55.472 --> 01:31:58.618
So, it seems to me
that it's that beauty itself...

633
01:31:58.686 --> 01:32:00.677
that he wants. It's almost as if...

634
01:32:00.719 --> 01:32:02.862
as if he's trying
to gather something.

635
01:32:03.808 --> 01:32:06.446
His ambitions of those
of a collector.

636
01:32:07.999 --> 01:32:12.082
- A collector of what?
- Their hair?

637
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:13.890
Get out! Get out!

638
01:32:19.052 --> 01:32:20.523
Whatever it is...

639
01:32:21.307 --> 01:32:26.819
I fear he won't stop killing
until his collection is complete.

640
01:32:47.194 --> 01:32:48.537
Here you are! Next!

641
01:32:51.090 --> 01:32:51.771
You too!

642
01:32:51.841 --> 01:32:52.503
Monsieur?

643
01:32:55.924 --> 01:32:58.381
This man... this man is a demon!

644
01:32:59.124 --> 01:33:02.355
A phantom who cannot be fought
by human means!

645
01:33:02.867 --> 01:33:07.926
Now I insist that we call upon
our bishop to excommunicate him!

646
01:33:08.137 --> 01:33:10.708
What good would that do?

647
01:33:10.922 --> 01:33:14.326
Have you no faith in the power
of our Holy Mother Church?

648
01:33:15.884 --> 01:33:19.484
It's not a matter of faith!
There's a murderer out there!

649
01:33:19.496 --> 01:33:22.419
And we must catch him
by using our God-given wits.

650
01:33:23.761 --> 01:33:26.201
I say, until we submit him
to our church...

651
01:33:27.268 --> 01:33:29.437
these killings will not cease.

652
01:33:46.122 --> 01:33:47.838
Citizens of Grasse...

653
01:33:48.038 --> 01:33:50.880
we hereby declare
that this murderer...

654
01:33:51.785 --> 01:33:54.318
is demon in our midst.

655
01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:58.239
Has incurred the sentence
of excommunication!

656
01:34:00.209 --> 01:34:05.678
Not only has this depraved monster
robbed us of our daughters...

657
01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:09.581
the young and fair
blossom of the city...

658
01:34:09.898 --> 01:34:13.697
and by his wanton acts,
has brought our trade...

659
01:34:13.744 --> 01:34:18.357
our livelihood,
our very existence...

660
01:34:18.630 --> 01:34:21.986
to the brink
of eternal darkness!

661
01:34:23.649 --> 01:34:27.916
We therefore declare,
that this vile viper...

662
01:34:28.278 --> 01:34:34.423
this ignominious carbuncle,
this extricable evil in our midsts...

663
01:34:35.095 --> 01:34:40.008
shall henceforth be solemnly
banned from our Holy Presence...

664
01:34:40.649 --> 01:34:45.098
rejected from the Communion
of Holy Mother Church...

665
01:34:45.417 --> 01:34:48.069
as a disciple of Satan.

666
01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:50.970
Slayer of souls...

667
01:34:51.032 --> 01:34:53.189
Stand clear! Stand clear!

668
01:34:55.307 --> 01:34:57.137
outsider of the faith...

669
01:34:57.738 --> 01:35:01.823
a necromancer, a diabolist,
a sorcerer...

670
01:35:02.081 --> 01:35:04.324
a damned heretic!

671
01:35:05.902 --> 01:35:09.135
Oh, God! In thy most
merciful spirit,

672
01:35:10.510 --> 01:35:13.545
bring down thunderbolts
upon his head!

673
01:35:14.256 --> 01:35:19.209
And may the Devil make stope
of his bones! Amen!

674
01:35:19.299 --> 01:35:21.820
My Lord! My Lord!

675
01:35:22.409 --> 01:35:23.870
It's a miracle!

676
01:35:24.026 --> 01:35:26.013
He's been caught! He's been caught!

677
01:35:27.944 --> 01:35:30.307
My Lord, the fiend
has been caught.

678
01:35:31.648 --> 01:35:34.444
In the city of Grenoble.
He's confessed to everything.

679
01:35:35.587 --> 01:35:37.242
He's confessed to everything!

680
01:35:39.749 --> 01:35:43.273
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

681
01:35:44.283 --> 01:35:49.715
Thanks be to God. And we thank him
for listening to our prayers...

682
01:35:50.166 --> 01:35:55.256
and answering them. Amen!

683
01:35:55.606 --> 01:36:00.330
Amen! Amen!

684
01:36:14.262 --> 01:36:17.651
Just read the report. This cannot
possibly be the same man.

685
01:36:21.142 --> 01:36:25.627
He confessed to everything,
including the murders in Grasse.

686
01:36:25.695 --> 01:36:28.298
Yes, and the torture.

687
01:36:29.496 --> 01:36:30.942
Look, here!

688
01:36:31.710 --> 01:36:34.087
He admits to strangling his victims...

689
01:36:34.461 --> 01:36:37.086
pulling out their hair,
and ravaging them.

690
01:36:37.157 --> 01:36:40.299
The girls of Grasse were killed
by a single blow to the back of their heads.

691
01:36:40.329 --> 01:36:43.645
Their hair was carefully cropped.
And not one of them was violated.

692
01:36:44.008 --> 01:36:45.634
Antoine...

693
01:36:46.383 --> 01:36:48.315
we're all happy it's over.

694
01:36:49.503 --> 01:36:51.005
Let it go.

695
01:37:38.411 --> 01:37:41.476
- Papa, what's the matter?
- We're going home, now!

696
01:37:41.667 --> 01:37:43.913
- But why? I'm enjoying myself!
- Don't argue with me!

697
01:37:44.188 --> 01:37:45.182
Stop it! I'm grown-up...

698
01:37:53.918 --> 01:37:55.588
Laura!

699
01:37:56.453 --> 01:37:57.890
Laura!

700
01:38:00.886 --> 01:38:02.086
Out of my way!

701
01:38:02.785 --> 01:38:03.814
Laura!

702
01:39:00.806 --> 01:39:03.824
- Laura!
- Papa!

703
01:39:09.995 --> 01:39:12.082
I'm so sorry.

704
01:39:25.176 --> 01:39:28.155
I know you must think me
a very foolish man.

705
01:39:29.379 --> 01:39:31.308
But try to understand.

706
01:39:32.411 --> 01:39:35.922
- You're all I have left.
- You don't need to explain, papa.

707
01:39:35.968 --> 01:39:39.037
- If anything would happen to you...
- I know.

708
01:39:39.636 --> 01:39:42.083
But you must stop worrying
about me all the time.

709
01:40:03.474 --> 01:40:04.912
Sweet dreams, my love.

710
01:40:09.079 --> 01:40:10.585
Sweet dreams, papa.

711
01:41:11.003 --> 01:41:12.607
Laura!

712
01:41:22.767 --> 01:41:25.120
Papa, what's the matter?

713
01:41:30.003 --> 01:41:31.319
Did you open the window?

714
01:41:33.567 --> 01:41:35.866
No. Why?

715
01:41:39.273 --> 01:41:42.769
Have this letter dispatched to
the Marquis de Montesquieu immediately.

716
01:41:43.714 --> 01:41:45.289
Marie, quickly!

717
01:42:32.292 --> 01:42:34.281
Stay on the road north,
into the mountains.

718
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:55.200
- Did Monsieur Richis leave?
- He did.

719
01:42:55.754 --> 01:42:56.881
Which way?

720
01:42:57.937 --> 01:42:59.436
North.

721
01:43:05.828 --> 01:43:09.101
- You sure it wasn't south?
- I saw them with my own eyes!

722
01:43:09.495 --> 01:43:11.032
What do you want to know?

723
01:43:12.901 --> 01:43:15.823
I said north, north!

724
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:19.329
Grenouille?

725
01:43:21.456 --> 01:43:22.831
Grenouille!

726
01:43:25.269 --> 01:43:26.612
Grenouille!

727
01:43:37.019 --> 01:43:38.423
Grenouille!

728
01:43:54.433 --> 01:43:55.947
Good God!

729
01:44:53.123 --> 01:44:54.977
- Good afternoon, monsieur.
- Good afternoon.

730
01:44:55.026 --> 01:44:56.716
Do you have anyone
else staying here?

731
01:44:58.108 --> 01:44:59.084
No, monsieur.

732
01:44:59.288 --> 01:45:01.791
Then I would like to take
all your rooms for the night.

733
01:45:01.859 --> 01:45:03.826
It will be a pleasure, monsieur.

734
01:45:05.759 --> 01:45:09.269
And tomorrow, first light,
we wish to be ferried to the Iles de L¨¦rins.

735
01:45:09.906 --> 01:45:12.547
- It's deserted except for a few...
- I'm aware of that.

736
01:45:14.407 --> 01:45:15.361
Very well, monsieur.

737
01:45:20.028 --> 01:45:21.936
Our finest room, mademoiselle.

738
01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:26.799
With the superb view of the sea.

739
01:45:27.636 --> 01:45:28.555
One moment.

740
01:45:35.256 --> 01:45:36.330
Very well.

741
01:45:37.466 --> 01:45:42.164
- Do you have a room next to this?
- Yes, but the view cannot be compared to...

742
01:45:42.454 --> 01:45:44.464
There have no interest
in the view.

743
01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:04.558
Oh, my God...

744
01:46:29.054 --> 01:46:29.993
Monsieur.

745
01:46:37.871 --> 01:46:41.919
Papa, will you please
tell me now what's happening.

746
01:46:42.649 --> 01:46:44.026
You haven't said a word all day.

747
01:46:45.013 --> 01:46:46.708
Why all the secrecy?

748
01:46:51.119 --> 01:46:53.103
Last night, I dreamt
you were dead...

749
01:46:54.394 --> 01:46:57.421
murdered
like all the other girls.

750
01:47:06.194 --> 01:47:09.633
The truth is I'm convinced that
the killer is still here somewhere.

751
01:47:11.421 --> 01:47:15.662
All of his victims were young and beautiful,
and who is there more beautiful than you, Laura?

752
01:47:17.856 --> 01:47:22.965
Whatever his insane scheme,
it will surely be incomplete without you.

753
01:47:31.383 --> 01:47:34.664
I've written to the Marquis accepting
his proposal and marriage on your behalf,

754
01:47:34.726 --> 01:47:38.006
and requesting that it take place
as soon as possible.

755
01:47:39.256 --> 01:47:42.316
Until then, you stay
in the safety of the monastery.

756
01:47:44.088 --> 01:47:48.817
- And all this, because you had a bad dream?
- I've made my decision.

757
01:47:48.935 --> 01:47:53.191
- But I don't know whether I even love him!
- I'm afraid the circumstances leave us no choice.

758
01:47:53.272 --> 01:47:55.975
- Papa!
- It's all arranged, Laura.

759
01:53:45.955 --> 01:53:47.039
On your feet!

760
01:53:47.605 --> 01:53:48.646
Hands in the air!

761
01:54:34.626 --> 01:54:37.231
Why did you kill my daughter?

762
01:54:41.353 --> 01:54:42.449
Why?

763
01:54:45.759 --> 01:54:47.252
I needed her.

764
01:55:13.622 --> 01:55:15.957
Why did you kill my daughter?

765
01:55:20.408 --> 01:55:22.029
I just...

766
01:55:24.753 --> 01:55:26.286
needed her.

767
01:55:34.071 --> 01:55:35.388
Very well.

768
01:55:37.594 --> 01:55:39.917
But you remember this:

769
01:55:46.501 --> 01:55:48.399
I'll be looking at you...

770
01:55:51.054 --> 01:55:52.631
when you're laid on the cross,

771
01:55:52.696 --> 01:55:57.375
and the twelve blows are
crashing down on your limbs.

772
01:55:59.603 --> 01:56:05.236
When the crowd is finally tired
of your screams and wandered home...

773
01:56:06.456 --> 01:56:10.755
I will climb up
through your blood...

774
01:56:12.595 --> 01:56:14.869
and sit beside you.

775
01:56:16.515 --> 01:56:20.108
I will look deep
into your eyes...

776
01:56:21.144 --> 01:56:24.322
and drop by drop...

777
01:56:26.271 --> 01:56:30.280
I will trickle my digust into them...

778
01:56:32.023 --> 01:56:35.003
like burning acid...

779
01:56:36.822 --> 01:56:38.285
until...

780
01:56:41.810 --> 01:56:43.328
finally...

781
01:56:46.965 --> 01:56:49.085
you perish.

782
01:57:24.426 --> 01:57:26.015
What do you think
they'll do to him?

783
01:57:26.307 --> 01:57:30.194
Apparently, they're gonna break
every bone in his body with an iron bar.

784
01:57:43.574 --> 01:57:45.008
Look, there he comes!

785
01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:50.484
Unchain the prisoner.

786
01:59:01.952 --> 01:59:03.545
That's enough.

787
01:59:05.032 --> 01:59:07.035
Let him be brought
to the scaffold.

788
01:59:12.143 --> 01:59:13.110
What's that?

789
02:00:27.188 --> 02:00:28.980
Is he coming? What's his name?

790
02:02:19.047 --> 02:02:22.100
This man is innocent.

791
02:02:25.996 --> 02:02:28.815
- He didn't do it. It's impossible!
- He's innocent!

792
02:02:33.257 --> 02:02:34.537
He's innocent!

793
02:03:54.766 --> 02:03:59.127
This is no man!
This is an angel!

794
02:10:07.529 --> 02:10:09.839
You can't fool me!

795
02:10:58.639 --> 02:11:00.238
Forgive me!

796
02:11:06.900 --> 02:11:09.067
My son!

797
02:12:11.630 --> 02:12:15.619
People of Grasse
awoke to a terrible hangover.

798
02:12:16.937 --> 02:12:22.166
For many of them, the experience
was so gustly, so completely inexplicable...

799
02:12:22.199 --> 02:12:28.387
and incompatible with their morals,
that they literally erased it from their memories.

800
02:12:29.032 --> 02:12:32.027
The town council
was in session by the afternoon.

801
02:12:32.151 --> 02:12:38.307
And an order was passed to the police lieutenant
to immediately begin fresh investigations into the murders.

802
02:12:39.455 --> 02:12:42.488
The following day, Dominique Druot
was arrested.

803
02:12:42.575 --> 02:12:47.340
Since it was in his backyard that the clothes
and hair of all the victims had been found.

804
02:12:48.356 --> 02:12:51.785
After fourteen hours of torture,
Druot confessed to everything.

805
02:12:54.619 --> 02:12:57.281
With that, the case was closed.

806
02:13:01.648 --> 02:13:05.481
By then, Grenouille was already
halfway back to Paris.

807
02:13:09.461 --> 02:13:13.801
He still had enough perfume left
to enslave the whole world, if he so chose.

808
02:13:14.513 --> 02:13:17.754
He could walk to Versailles,
and have the King kiss his feet.

809
02:13:18.177 --> 02:13:22.713
He could write the Pope a perfumed letter,
and reveal himself as a new Messiah.

810
02:13:23.535 --> 02:13:26.594
He could do all this,
and more if he wanted to.

811
02:13:27.319 --> 02:13:31.956
He possessed a power stronger
than the power of money, or terror, or death.

812
02:13:32.747 --> 02:13:36.616
The invincible power
to command the love of mankind.

813
02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:46.269
There was only one thing
the perfume could not do.

814
02:13:46.666 --> 02:13:52.047
It could not turn him into a person
who could love and be loved like everyone else.

815
02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:57.193
So, to hell with it, he thought.
To hell with the world.

816
02:13:57.689 --> 02:14:00.715
With the perfume, with himself.

817
02:14:03.511 --> 02:14:08.797
On the 25th of June, 1766,
around 11 o'clock at night,

818
02:14:09.033 --> 02:14:12.249
Grenouille entered the city
through the port-de-Leones.

819
02:14:12.805 --> 02:14:19.807
And like a sleepwalker, his olfactory memories
drew him back to the place where he was born.

820
02:15:42.004 --> 02:15:44.838
An angel!

821
02:15:46.279 --> 02:15:48.265
I love you!

822
02:16:35.557 --> 02:16:41.289
Within no time, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille
had disappeared from the face of the earth.

823
02:16:42.332 --> 02:16:47.170
When they had finished,
they felt a virginal glow of happiness.

824
02:16:47.887 --> 02:16:53.182
For the first time in their lives,
they believed that they had done something...

825
02:16:53.426 --> 02:16:56.791
purely out of love.

826
02:17:27.539 --> 02:17:29.590
Hey, over here!

827
02:17:30.179 --> 02:17:31.174
Look!

828
02:17:38.497 --> 02:17:39.787
Let's take them away.

829
02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:41.760
You could wear them.
