My cousin said there's
a kid who smokes there.

00:02:34.834 --> 00:02:37.918
- You see anything?
- No. A lot of yappin'. Come on.

- Ah, there we go.
- All right.

44
00:02:39.793 --> 00:02:42.876
Another year, another batch
of 5th grade head cases.

45
00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.918
Kabir, Anthony, welcome.

46
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:48.251
You from New York, new
guy? Patriots suck!

47
00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:49.543
That's New England.

48
00:02:49.626 --> 00:02:52.376
- I think your shirt's on backwards.
- Come on!

49
00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.543
- Look at this. Bunch of motormouths.
- Yep. Same old, same old.

50
00:02:55.626 --> 00:02:57.668
I saw Cara in a
sweater from Gymboree.

51
00:02:57.751 --> 00:02:59.793
- There's the snotty clique.
- Tween Queens.

52
00:02:59.876 --> 00:03:02.543
- The Facade Squad.
- Peaking at 11.

53
00:03:02.626 --> 00:03:06.043
- The "sick and should've stayed home" kid.
- Always one.

54
00:03:06.126 --> 00:03:08.709
There's the class clown who
secretly despises himself.

55
00:03:08.793 --> 00:03:10.209
That's hysterical, Cole!

56
00:03:10.293 --> 00:03:13.001
- Thanks, Cole!
- Jeez, how many Coles this year?

57
00:03:13.084 --> 00:03:16.334
Reminds me of the Justin
avalanche of 1991.

58
00:03:16.418 --> 00:03:18.501
God forbid we ever
see a Richie again.

59
00:03:18.584 --> 00:03:21.251
Bro, no way, are you
taller than me now?

60
00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:23.376
The inevitable Cheez Doodle kid.

61
00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.501
No, those look like
Dorito fingers.

62
00:03:25.584 --> 00:03:27.584
- We just moved from the Bronx.
- You're new? Wow.

63
00:03:27.668 --> 00:03:31.459
That's hard. Never had to leave friends,
except when we went to Myrtle Beach.

64
00:03:31.543 --> 00:03:33.824
On the flight home, the old
lady next to me had arthritis.

65
00:03:33.876 --> 00:03:35.209
I opened her mustard packet.

66
00:03:35.293 --> 00:03:37.209
- First child.
- No filter.

67
00:03:37.293 --> 00:03:39.626
Never heard the word "enough."

68
00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.918
Okay, guys. Are you excited?

69
00:03:42.001 --> 00:03:45.126
Most of you have been going
to this school for five years.

70
00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.751
Some of you, seven. And
now you're the big kids.

71
00:03:47.834 --> 00:03:51.793
I hope everyone's met our class
pets, Leonardo and Squirtle.

72
00:03:51.876 --> 00:03:53.084
I'm not touching those things.

73
00:03:53.168 --> 00:03:55.584
Don't they eat, sleep and
poo in the same place?

74
00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:57.834
Hey! I poo where he sleeps.

75
00:03:57.918 --> 00:03:59.126
Now what if I told you

76
00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.709
there's a big reward at the end of
this year if you do well in class?

77
00:04:02.793 --> 00:04:04.626
The Academicathalon thing?

78
00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.584
Look at her work these
kids. Salinas, what a pro.

79
00:04:07.668 --> 00:04:10.168
Best since Ms.
Bielecky in the '60s.

80
00:04:10.251 --> 00:04:13.418
And what if I told you
this year's winning class

81
00:04:13.501 --> 00:04:16.418
gets a field trip to somewhere
special for a whole day?

82
00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:18.599
Yeah!

83
00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:19.668
Wow!

84
00:04:19.693 --> 00:04:21.935
- Salinas havin' a baby?
- The belly's poppin' a little.

85
00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.459
Oh, Zane, I'm afraid you can't
bring snacks into the class.

86
00:04:25.484 --> 00:04:26.959
I'll hold those, just for now.

87
00:04:27.043 --> 00:04:29.001
Cheetos. Wow, didn't
see that coming.

88
00:04:29.084 --> 00:04:32.584
At the end of the year,
our three 5th grade classes

89
00:04:32.668 --> 00:04:36.543
compete in art, debating,
science, and history.

90
00:04:36.626 --> 00:04:40.418
And if our class wins, we get
a trip to Magic Land Park!

91
00:04:41.418 --> 00:04:44.668
Don't they have the Dragon Coaster?
I heard it caught fire once!

92
00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:48.209
- Yeah, it was banned in Europe.
- Yes, but not in Florida.

93
00:04:48.293 --> 00:04:50.501
Yep, havin' a baby.

94
00:04:50.584 --> 00:04:53.626
Okay. Let's see how much
you guys already know.

95
00:04:53.709 --> 00:04:56.209
Who knows what you
call it when a plant…

96
00:04:56.293 --> 00:04:58.293
…converts light to food?

97
00:04:58.376 --> 00:05:00.602
- The conversion's photosynthesis…
- Photosynthesis.

98
00:05:00.626 --> 00:05:03.459
- …turning H2O and CO2 into glucose.
- Into glucose.

99
00:05:03.543 --> 00:05:06.376
- Ah.
- Excellent job, Mia.

100
00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:09.084
Oh. So…

101
00:05:09.168 --> 00:05:10.959
Oh, boy. Divorced parents.

102
00:05:11.043 --> 00:05:12.834
Okay, honey. Thank you.

103
00:05:12.918 --> 00:05:15.001
You're okay. So sweet.

104
00:05:15.084 --> 00:05:16.126
Okay.

105
00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:19.251
Let's look at some of the books
we're gonna read in class this year.

106
00:05:19.334 --> 00:05:21.209
Who's heard of Charlotte's Web?

107
00:05:21.293 --> 00:05:23.876
Oh no. The kids
always cry at the end.

108
00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:27.043
Like kids don't cry enough? We
gotta trigger the garden hoses?

109
00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:28.876
- Crying's for weaklings.
- Right.

110
00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:31.084
We'll meet Fern and
her pig, Wilbur.

111
00:05:31.168 --> 00:05:32.834
It's a stupid book anyway.

112
00:05:32.918 --> 00:05:36.793
- Right. Animals never talk to people.
- Plus, no one gets to eat Charlotte.

113
00:05:36.876 --> 00:05:40.001
You just have to hear about
this delicious spider for days

114
00:05:40.084 --> 00:05:41.876
and get hungry
thinkin' about it.

115
00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:44.043
…like you'll learn this year.

116
00:05:44.126 --> 00:05:47.418
Sorry, Cole? Is there
something you wanna share?

117
00:05:48.418 --> 00:05:50.501
That's so gross!

118
00:05:50.584 --> 00:05:54.043
I can't believe you did that!

119
00:05:54.918 --> 00:05:55.918
Sorry, guys.

120
00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:58.293
Man, that smells good.

121
00:05:58.376 --> 00:06:01.918
Send some of that our way next
time. Gettin' sick of the lettuce.

122
00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:04.751
Hi, Mrs. Salinas!

123
00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:11.126
- Hi, I'm Cole Wiseki's mom.
- Oh, hi.

124
00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:12.876
Can I... Real
quick? For Facebook?

125
00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:14.668
Thanks.

126
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:17.793
- Cole is a very...
- That's gonna look great. Thank you.

127
00:06:17.876 --> 00:06:19.959
Since when do people
wanna look like ducks?

128
00:06:21.209 --> 00:06:23.251
Isn't that something,
how they've grown?

129
00:06:23.334 --> 00:06:26.793
And in 5th grade, you'll find your
kids wanting to make their own choices.

130
00:06:26.876 --> 00:06:29.459
Embrace it. Let them
make their own mistakes.

131
00:06:29.543 --> 00:06:30.959
How long does this go?

132
00:06:31.043 --> 00:06:32.793
Not terribly long, Dr. Wenger.

133
00:06:32.876 --> 00:06:35.876
Now, some of you may have
heard about Mrs. Salinas', uh,

134
00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:37.334
incident in class.

135
00:06:37.418 --> 00:06:42.209
I want to confirm it has nothing to do
with anything she ate in the cafeteria.

136
00:06:42.293 --> 00:06:45.793
She's just gonna be taking some
time off. A leave, let's say.

137
00:06:45.876 --> 00:06:47.376
Wait. For how long?

138
00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:48.876
Here comes the bomb.

139
00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:52.126
For, uh… Till she has
the baby, let's say.

140
00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:54.793
- What?!
- Having a baby?

141
00:06:54.876 --> 00:06:57.376
Are you sure? Did she
get a second opinion?

142
00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:59.876
Are you kidding me? This is
what happened in 3rd grade!

143
00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:01.126
The substitute was awful!

144
00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:04.376
I'm texting my daughter right
now! She'll be devastated!

145
00:07:42.126 --> 00:07:44.418
You can't just say that!

146
00:07:44.501 --> 00:07:47.376
Look at these lazy class
pets. Do they even move?

147
00:07:47.459 --> 00:07:50.084
- I'd like that job.
- That lizard looks pretty old.

148
00:07:50.168 --> 00:07:51.459
Do I look old?

149
00:07:52.418 --> 00:07:53.251
Mm-mm.

150
00:07:53.334 --> 00:07:54.334
Thank you.

151
00:07:55.126 --> 00:07:58.626
It's a Tuatara. They live
a long time. Till about 75.

152
00:07:58.709 --> 00:08:01.959
Hmm. Never knew that.
Suck on that, hamsters.

153
00:08:02.043 --> 00:08:04.209
Wow. Looks like he's
gettin' close to that.

154
00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:07.084
Bye. Nice seeing you.

155
00:08:07.168 --> 00:08:08.459
Ah, he's nuts.

156
00:08:08.543 --> 00:08:12.459
I mean, you're old, cranky, lazy,
but no way does that make you 75.

157
00:08:12.543 --> 00:08:15.334
Seventy-five.
Seventy-five. Seventy-five.

158
00:08:24.793 --> 00:08:26.709
Underneath it says,

159
00:08:26.793 --> 00:08:29.959
"Here men from the planet Earth
first set foot upon the Moon."

160
00:08:30.043 --> 00:08:32.084
We came in peace...

161
00:08:37.209 --> 00:08:38.834
1949.

162
00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:41.043
- What about it?
- I was born around then.

163
00:08:41.126 --> 00:08:43.709
How many years has
it been since 1949?

164
00:08:43.793 --> 00:08:45.293
No idea. That's addition.

165
00:08:45.376 --> 00:08:47.626
They learn that in 2nd grade.
We're all about fractions.

166
00:08:47.709 --> 00:08:51.376
Great. Why can't they move us around
a little, so we can know more?

167
00:08:58.001 --> 00:09:01.334
Okay, four sixteenths
equals how many fourths?

168
00:09:04.126 --> 00:09:07.001
- She's leaving. They don't hear a word.
- 1966, 1967…

169
00:09:07.084 --> 00:09:10.084
- What're you doin'?
- Trying to count how many years old I am.

170
00:09:10.168 --> 00:09:13.126
1968, 1969, 1970…

171
00:09:13.209 --> 00:09:16.251
I'm out of toes and fingers.
What else can I count with?

172
00:09:16.334 --> 00:09:19.584
I'd tell you, but
there's kids around.

173
00:09:19.668 --> 00:09:21.751
I was talkin' about his tail.

174
00:09:21.834 --> 00:09:25.043
Addition… I… I gotta talk
to some 2nd grade pets.

175
00:09:25.126 --> 00:09:28.043
Forget it. We only see
those pets at fire drills.

176
00:09:28.126 --> 00:09:30.043
They don't happen
until November.

177
00:09:30.126 --> 00:09:32.751
What the...

178
00:09:32.834 --> 00:09:35.043
- Huh? What?
- Is this a fire drill?

179
00:09:35.126 --> 00:09:38.793
It's probably nothing, but let's go.
Anthony, why don't you grab the pets?

180
00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:44.043
Everyone evacuate!
Stop, drop and roll!

181
00:09:44.126 --> 00:09:46.584
I think I'm on fire!

182
00:09:48.959 --> 00:09:50.959
Jeez, we just redecorated!

183
00:09:51.043 --> 00:09:54.501
Someday, cops are gonna carry
that kid off a plane. Huh?

184
00:09:54.584 --> 00:09:57.001
I'll park ya right
over here, fellas.

185
00:09:57.084 --> 00:09:59.001
All right, here we go.

186
00:09:59.084 --> 00:10:02.001
Hey, guys, how was your
summer? Do anything fun?

187
00:10:02.084 --> 00:10:03.709
- Sleep.
- Sleep.

188
00:10:03.793 --> 00:10:06.084
- Eat.
- Lot of poopin'.

189
00:10:06.168 --> 00:10:09.168
Terrific. Say, who's
2nd grade again?

190
00:10:09.251 --> 00:10:11.334
- That's me. How ya doin', Lizzy?
- Great.

191
00:10:11.418 --> 00:10:16.793
I'm actually Leonardo. Lizzy's the iguana
in Mr. Marculia's homeroom. You're…

192
00:10:16.876 --> 00:10:20.626
I'm Cinnabun. I know. So
corny. Just got renamed again.

193
00:10:20.709 --> 00:10:22.376
Oh. Well, beats "Thumper."

194
00:10:22.459 --> 00:10:27.459
I guess. What's bad are the Hare ones.
Hare Brain, Hare Piece, Hare-y Potter…

195
00:10:27.543 --> 00:10:31.251
Right, right. Hey, the 2nd graders,
you guys do addition, right?

196
00:10:31.334 --> 00:10:33.334
…Hare Lip, Hare Club For Men.

197
00:10:33.418 --> 00:10:35.001
Yes, and subtraction.
We do both.

198
00:10:35.084 --> 00:10:38.959
Great, okay, look. If
I got here in 1949,

199
00:10:39.043 --> 00:10:42.709
and it's 2023, what
does that make me?

200
00:10:42.793 --> 00:10:45.376
Oh. Uh, I know this
one. A reptile.

201
00:10:45.459 --> 00:10:46.793
Shmuck.

202
00:10:46.876 --> 00:10:49.543
Okay, it was a false alarm.

203
00:10:49.626 --> 00:10:51.793
The school is not on fire.

204
00:10:55.293 --> 00:10:56.876
No, how old would I be?

205
00:10:56.959 --> 00:11:01.418
No. Right, subtraction. Okay,
um, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, 74.

206
00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:04.626
- Seventy-four. Isn't that right before...
- Upsy-daisies.

207
00:11:04.709 --> 00:11:06.543
Wait, wait! Hold on!

208
00:11:06.626 --> 00:11:09.626
That's the number
before 75, isn't it?

209
00:11:09.709 --> 00:11:13.751
What's the matter?
You look upset.

210
00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:17.584
Cinnabun!

211
00:11:17.668 --> 00:11:19.751
Settle down.

212
00:11:19.834 --> 00:11:22.459
I'm a lizard. Ooh.

213
00:11:22.543 --> 00:11:24.626
That's good. Don't dignify it.

214
00:11:24.709 --> 00:11:27.001
Doesn't matter. I'm doomed.

215
00:11:27.084 --> 00:11:30.293
I'm 74 seventy-fifths dead.

216
00:11:30.376 --> 00:11:32.501
What? That's not for class pets.

217
00:11:32.584 --> 00:11:35.209
When you're in captivity,
75 is the new 70.

218
00:11:35.293 --> 00:11:38.668
And, hey, you wanna live so bad, a
little exercise wouldn't kill ya.

219
00:11:38.751 --> 00:11:41.126
- Like what?
- Blinking's good. That'd be a start.

220
00:11:41.209 --> 00:11:43.209
- I blink.
- Barely.

221
00:11:43.293 --> 00:11:44.293
Fine.

222
00:11:50.584 --> 00:11:53.959
Okay. You didn't have
to dive right in.

223
00:11:54.043 --> 00:11:55.209
Who am I kiddin'?

224
00:11:55.293 --> 00:11:59.501
I can't start this rigorous workin'
out at this point in my life.

225
00:11:59.584 --> 00:12:02.001
It's too late. I blew it.

226
00:12:02.084 --> 00:12:04.043
I wasted my life!

227
00:12:04.543 --> 00:12:07.668

Everyone, meet your new teacher.

This is our substitute?

243
00:13:45.584 --> 00:13:47.793
You have to leave? So soon?

244
00:13:47.876 --> 00:13:51.001
Well, my doctor thinks I need
to rest through my pregnancy.

245
00:13:51.084 --> 00:13:53.709
So until I'm back,
you'll have Ms. Malkin.

246
00:13:53.793 --> 00:13:56.668
It's not brain surgery, gang.

247
00:13:56.751 --> 00:13:59.751
Guys, you don't have
to be afraid of change.

248
00:13:59.834 --> 00:14:02.251

How about we continue with the class.
I'm gonna teach with Ms. Malkin today...

254
00:14:21.793 --> 00:14:24.376
- Please don't leave us, Mrs. Salinas!
- Oh.

255
00:14:24.459 --> 00:14:26.876
Agh! Down! Now! Down!

256
00:14:26.959 --> 00:14:28.376
No hug! Sit!

257
00:14:28.459 --> 00:14:32.709
In class, we sit up straight, pay
attention, and we are what? You!

258
00:14:32.793 --> 00:14:35.793
What? Oh, my God.
Um, we're quiet?

259
00:14:35.876 --> 00:14:38.918
That's very good listening,
Logan. That's a heart for you.

260
00:14:44.293 --> 00:14:46.918
The hearts are for when the
kids listen. To motivate good...

261
00:14:51.418 --> 00:14:53.251
Listening is not a favor.

262
00:14:53.334 --> 00:14:56.668
When you listen, you get
knowledge, not a carnival prize.

263
00:14:56.751 --> 00:15:02.584
We have a chance
to go to Magic...

264
00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:04.001
Ew. What was that?

265
00:15:04.084 --> 00:15:06.668
Peanut butter and
ham. My dad overslept.

266
00:15:10.626 --> 00:15:14.543
Okay, well, we're out of time, so
let's wish Mrs. Salinas well. Bye-bye.

267
00:15:14.626 --> 00:15:17.209
- But, I... The class is...
- No, no. I know. Out we go.

268
00:15:17.293 --> 00:15:19.793
- Better luck with your own kid.
- Okay, guys, see you in...

269
00:15:23.168 --> 00:15:28.668
Moving on. It's Friday. That means one
student has to take home a class pet.

270
00:15:28.751 --> 00:15:31.543
- What's this now?
- Uh, we don't do that here.

271
00:15:31.626 --> 00:15:32.834
Not anymore. No way.

272
00:15:32.918 --> 00:15:37.001
In my classroom, you will
learn responsibility.

273
00:15:37.084 --> 00:15:40.959
You will feed it properly and
return it in healthy condition.

274
00:15:41.043 --> 00:15:42.043
Alive.

275
00:15:42.459 --> 00:15:44.626
Do we have a volunteer?

276
00:15:46.334 --> 00:15:49.251
- Come on. Somebody raise your hand.
- What?

277
00:15:49.334 --> 00:15:53.626
Remember what happens at the kids' houses?
They forget to feed you or abuse you.

278
00:15:57.084 --> 00:15:59.043
It'll grow back.

279
00:16:07.501 --> 00:16:09.959
- Yeesh.
- Hey, it looked cool in the '90s.

280
00:16:10.043 --> 00:16:12.709
I'm waiting. Volunteer, please.

281
00:16:12.793 --> 00:16:14.834
Don't you get it?
This is my shot.

282
00:16:14.918 --> 00:16:18.251
So I go with one of these kids,
case the house for open windows,

283
00:16:18.334 --> 00:16:20.626
then when I'm alone,
zip! I escape.

284
00:16:20.709 --> 00:16:25.168
- Ha. You couldn't zip when you were 20.
- I'm zipping. And then I really live.

285
00:16:25.251 --> 00:16:28.876
Maybe climb a tree. Swim in
a sewer. See the Everglades.

286
00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:32.501
The Everglades? With those
untamed animals? Are you nuts?

287
00:16:32.584 --> 00:16:35.209
You know they don't even have
names, right? It's anarchy.

288
00:16:35.293 --> 00:16:37.918
You think a rock potato
like you can survive there?

289
00:16:38.001 --> 00:16:40.793
- Your last days will be in a beer can.
- Let's go.

290
00:16:40.876 --> 00:16:43.418
Who's gonna take on
some responsibility?

291
00:16:43.501 --> 00:16:46.084
- Or do I have to pick?
- Well, if no one else will…

292
00:16:46.168 --> 00:16:48.709
I don't want them to feel not
wanted. Everybody wants to fit in

293
00:16:48.793 --> 00:16:51.668
and shouldn't be judged on
looks, species, foreheads.

294
00:16:51.751 --> 00:16:53.793
I have to go indoor
skydiving tomorrow,

295
00:16:53.876 --> 00:16:56.209
but my father'll be home,
so if it's okay to...

296
00:16:56.293 --> 00:16:57.793
- Pick one!
- Okay, the lizard!

297
00:17:07.501 --> 00:17:11.751
Listen, when you're out there in the
wild and those animals come after you,

298
00:17:11.834 --> 00:17:15.293
remember to change your
colors and blend in!

299
00:17:15.376 --> 00:17:19.334
- That's chameleons. I'm not a chameleon.
- Oh, well, then you're a dead man.

300
00:17:22.418 --> 00:17:25.501
Tomorrow's indoor skydiving.
We have to get ready.

301
00:17:25.584 --> 00:17:28.168
It's exactly like skydiving,
except you can't get hurt.

302
00:17:28.251 --> 00:17:30.418
Okay, we have a busy weekend.

303
00:17:30.501 --> 00:17:33.793
Do I have to wear a dress to Grandma's?
It'll be pants weather on Sunday.

304
00:17:33.876 --> 00:17:37.626
Jayda said the word "puke". She
said it wasn’t a curse word. Is it?

305
00:17:37.709 --> 00:17:40.751
I feel bad leaving him. Nobody
wants him near the dinner table.

306
00:17:40.834 --> 00:17:42.459
He's good with his
water. Back soon!

307
00:17:42.543 --> 00:17:45.501
Kayla, don't look scared
of him. That's being mean.

308
00:17:55.293 --> 00:17:56.584
It's on.

309
00:18:15.501 --> 00:18:16.543
Yeah.

310
00:18:27.043 --> 00:18:29.584
He's nice, the new kid Kabir,
but he doesn't talk a lot,

311
00:18:29.668 --> 00:18:31.918
at least not with me.
Maybe he's shy since…

312
00:18:37.584 --> 00:18:40.668
Then I burned my tongue. It
didn't, like, burn off completely,

313
00:18:40.751 --> 00:18:43.918
or I couldn't tell you how
I ate my mozzarella sticks.

314
00:18:57.709 --> 00:19:02.126
Hey, Leonardo. You missed a great movie.
Tomorrow I'll take you down for breakfast.

315
00:19:02.209 --> 00:19:06.293
I hope they have everything bagels left.
I don't know why we get sesame bagels.

316
00:19:06.376 --> 00:19:10.376
Mom asked me to try one, I was like,
"Why would you take off the poppy seeds

317
00:19:10.459 --> 00:19:11.334
and the salt…"

318
00:19:11.418 --> 00:19:13.084
Wait, where are you?

319
00:19:13.168 --> 00:19:16.126
This is a nightmare! I'll be
the kid who killed the lizard,

320
00:19:16.209 --> 00:19:18.043
no matter what I do in my life.

321
00:19:18.126 --> 00:19:21.293
Whether I do drama, be a doctor...
I'll never be a doctor now.

322
00:19:21.376 --> 00:19:24.418
I could work at the DMV.
Hopefully, the one next to Quiznos.

323
00:19:24.501 --> 00:19:27.459
I don't wanna go
far from my parents.

324
00:19:27.543 --> 00:19:29.418
Mother of Godzilla!

325
00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:30.501
What was that?

326
00:19:31.543 --> 00:19:32.959
Well? Who said that?

327
00:19:34.293 --> 00:19:38.459
The wall? Walls don't talk.
Why would a wall say anything?

328
00:19:38.543 --> 00:19:41.418
Why point to it? They say,
"If these walls could talk,"

329
00:19:41.501 --> 00:19:42.751
because they can't talk...

330
00:19:42.834 --> 00:19:44.668
The trophy!

331
00:19:44.751 --> 00:19:47.376
You said something!
You just spoke! Mom!

332
00:19:47.459 --> 00:19:48.751
- No!
- You talked!

333
00:19:48.834 --> 00:19:49.918
You're talking!

334
00:19:50.001 --> 00:19:52.168
I'm telling Mom, or people
will think I'm crazy.

335
00:19:52.251 --> 00:19:55.168
I'll have to go to that school in
Tampa for kids with issues! I...

336
00:19:55.251 --> 00:19:57.793
But please, people can't know!

337
00:19:58.668 --> 00:20:01.501
- Why are your hands wet?
- They're naturally moist.

338
00:20:01.584 --> 00:20:03.834
Please, I'm begging
you to keep quiet.

339
00:20:03.918 --> 00:20:05.376
If people know I talk,

340
00:20:05.459 --> 00:20:07.959
they'll send me to a
scientist or something.

341
00:20:08.043 --> 00:20:10.584
- But I have to tell someone.
- Please.

342
00:20:11.751 --> 00:20:14.543
You're the only one
who can hear me.

343
00:20:14.626 --> 00:20:17.418
Oh. Then why are you whispering?

344
00:20:17.501 --> 00:20:20.376
Because you were,
and it sounded fun.

345
00:20:23.168 --> 00:20:24.418
Do all lizards talk?

346
00:20:24.501 --> 00:20:29.459
I don't know. I never met them
all, but we never talk to humans.

347
00:20:29.543 --> 00:20:32.918
- Why are you talking to me?
- Well, I didn't…

348
00:20:33.418 --> 00:20:37.126
Because I want to.
I think you're nice.

349
00:20:37.209 --> 00:20:39.084
Really? Thanks.

350
00:20:39.168 --> 00:20:42.501
I don't know if people think I'm nice.
It's so hard to read people at school.

351
00:20:42.584 --> 00:20:44.459
People say you're
nice to be nice,

352
00:20:44.543 --> 00:20:47.126
and if they say you're nice,
you'll think they're cool...

353
00:20:47.209 --> 00:20:48.209
I get it.

354
00:20:48.293 --> 00:20:50.251
You say "I get it" a lot.

355
00:20:50.334 --> 00:20:55.043
That's 'cause I understand things.
That's all. "I get it." I've been around.

356
00:20:55.126 --> 00:20:58.209
- Okay. I thought it was something else.
- Like what?

357
00:20:58.293 --> 00:21:01.751
- That you want me to stop talking.
- Oh. Wow.

358
00:21:01.834 --> 00:21:03.876
Really? Like, "Wow,
that's crazy"?

359
00:21:03.959 --> 00:21:08.459
No, more like, "Wow, I didn't
think you were that self-aware."

360
00:21:08.543 --> 00:21:11.959
I can tell. People are too
nice to say I talk too much,

361
00:21:12.043 --> 00:21:14.310
but I can tell from their faces
that I'm talking too much.

362
00:21:14.334 --> 00:21:17.543
Like, old people make this face.
And babies kind of look sleepy.

363
00:21:17.626 --> 00:21:21.334
And the bus driver's face is like,
"Stop." But I can't stop and I…

364
00:21:23.459 --> 00:21:26.001

Well, that was really
nice. Thank you.

00:23:11.876 --> 00:23:13.626
Oh, yeah. Glad to do it.

400
00:23:14.459 --> 00:23:18.043
Hey, remember, you
can't tell anyone, ever.

401
00:23:18.126 --> 00:23:20.126
Or we won't be
able to talk again.

402
00:23:20.209 --> 00:23:24.126
Okay. So I'm your special, secret
friend? That was a question.

403
00:23:24.209 --> 00:23:27.251
Uh, yeah. Sure.
And good question.

404
00:23:27.334 --> 00:23:31.126
- Thanks, Leonardo.
- Call me Leo. Less Ninja Turtley.

405
00:23:31.209 --> 00:23:33.584
Summer. You need to
get to bed, sweetie.

406
00:23:33.668 --> 00:23:36.501
Mom, what's the
square root of 91?

407
00:23:36.584 --> 00:23:39.126
What? Please just get to bed.

408
00:23:39.709 --> 00:23:41.834
I don't mean just any question.

409
00:23:41.918 --> 00:23:43.668
Okay. Right. Got it.

410
00:23:47.334 --> 00:23:49.834
Find your new seats.

411
00:23:57.251 --> 00:24:00.876
Oh, back already? You saw the
whole world in one weekend?

412
00:24:00.959 --> 00:24:04.459
Wow. Hey, how were the Everglades?
How high was the Eiffel Tower?

413
00:24:04.543 --> 00:24:09.001
- What was the Pope like?
- Could you not do that on my pillow?

414
00:24:09.084 --> 00:24:14.584
Put those computers away. We will not
be studying our curriculum on toys.

415
00:24:33.626 --> 00:24:34.876
Russian judge.

416
00:24:37.126 --> 00:24:40.334
Slow down. No running.

417
00:24:40.418 --> 00:24:42.751
No eating the books!

418
00:24:43.459 --> 00:24:45.793
Oh, Coach Kimura.

419
00:24:45.876 --> 00:24:48.459
Oh, I apologize. Let me…
Let me clean that for you.

420
00:24:53.001 --> 00:24:54.168
There we go.

421
00:24:54.251 --> 00:24:58.834
This is so unfair. Ugh! She'll
work us till we have no energy.

422
00:24:58.918 --> 00:25:01.168
Then we'll only get into
schools with drug problems.

423
00:25:01.251 --> 00:25:03.709
Forget about winning the
trip. This is a nightmare.

424
00:25:03.793 --> 00:25:05.543
It's worse than when
I lost my phone.

425
00:25:05.626 --> 00:25:07.626
Worse than when my
dad wore bike shorts.

426
00:25:07.709 --> 00:25:10.749
Worse than when I got lost on a plane,
which is hard to do, but really scary.

427
00:25:10.793 --> 00:25:13.668
Like a horror movie, though my
parents won't let me watch them,

428
00:25:13.751 --> 00:25:16.376
unless you count the furnace
in Toy Story 3, but that...

429
00:25:17.918 --> 00:25:20.001
Oh. What should we
do about it, Jayda?

430
00:25:21.251 --> 00:25:25.043
I'm totally telling my parents
about it. My dad has a lot of pull,

431
00:25:25.126 --> 00:25:27.001
because he gives the
teachers free zit cream,

432
00:25:27.084 --> 00:25:28.668
but you should tell yours too.

433
00:25:28.751 --> 00:25:30.834
Why are you talking to Summer?

434
00:25:30.918 --> 00:25:33.584
- I like her now.
- Uh, I know. I do too.

435
00:25:38.501 --> 00:25:42.209
- What was that all about?
- She likes me. She thought I was fun.

436
00:25:42.293 --> 00:25:45.668
You fun? What'd you do, turn
your head more than once?

437
00:25:45.751 --> 00:25:46.751
Oh, what a showman.

438
00:25:46.834 --> 00:25:48.751
Get all your mean jokes in now,

439
00:25:48.834 --> 00:25:51.751
'cause the next kid who takes
me home is the last kid.

440
00:25:51.834 --> 00:25:53.751
Sure they are,
Mr. Chicken-to-leave.

441
00:25:53.834 --> 00:25:56.209
Whatever you say,
Mr. Wants-to-get-bitten.

442
00:25:56.293 --> 00:25:59.626
Oh, I'm shaking,
Mr. Almost-as-brave-as-Scooby Doo.

443
00:26:03.501 --> 00:26:06.751
Duck, duck, duck, goose!

444
00:26:06.834 --> 00:26:10.626
Ow! Okay. Okay. All right!
That's not the game. Kids!

445
00:26:10.709 --> 00:26:15.293
…the Stamp Act. Eyes up here! For
those of you who did the reading…

446
00:26:15.376 --> 00:26:18.751
- Salinas never taught this stuff.
- Yeah. What's a stamp?

447
00:26:18.834 --> 00:26:20.668
…the first tax levied directly

448
00:26:20.751 --> 00:26:22.631
on American colonists by
the British Parliament.

449
00:26:22.709 --> 00:26:26.043
Skyler, what did I just say?

450
00:26:28.168 --> 00:26:30.918
Answer! How did the
colonists react?

451
00:26:36.751 --> 00:26:37.751
Demerits!

452
00:26:42.543 --> 00:26:46.251
You do not want demerits.

453
00:26:46.334 --> 00:26:49.376
- What's a demerit?
- I think he played for the Clippers.

454
00:26:49.459 --> 00:26:52.209
You're going to leave 5th
grade with discipline,

455
00:26:52.293 --> 00:26:54.876
or you are never going
to leave 5th grade.

456
00:26:55.459 --> 00:26:56.959
Eh.

457
00:26:57.043 --> 00:27:00.501
Who has the discipline to take
a class pet home this weekend?

458
00:27:01.751 --> 00:27:03.918
I'll do it. I'll take Leo again.

459
00:27:04.001 --> 00:27:05.126
"Leo"?

460
00:27:05.834 --> 00:27:08.793
Again? Who would want it twice?

461
00:27:16.959 --> 00:27:20.084
Not one of you is man enough
for middle school, are you?

462
00:27:20.168 --> 00:27:23.293
Ugh. Not now. I'll
take the lizard.

463
00:27:29.126 --> 00:27:32.626
Oh, you'll have so much fun with Leo,
Eli. You think, maybe, I can visit?

464
00:27:32.709 --> 00:27:35.793
Really? That'd be great. Zane's
coming, but we can all hang...

465
00:27:58.751 --> 00:28:00.251
You kids having a fun play date?

466
00:28:01.543 --> 00:28:02.543
Uh…

467
00:28:03.043 --> 00:28:04.043
Sure.

468
00:28:26.251 --> 00:28:28.959
Sorry about those chips,
Zaney. Can't be too careful.

469
00:28:29.043 --> 00:28:30.584
Have a kale cupcake.

470
00:28:30.668 --> 00:28:33.251
Do I have to wear the
safety suit all weekend?

471
00:28:33.334 --> 00:28:35.043
Lizards carry disease, honey.

472
00:28:35.126 --> 00:28:37.918
Kids and dogs are
especially vulnerable.

473
00:28:50.418 --> 00:28:53.376
Um, I think my mom
wants to pick me up.

474
00:28:56.251 --> 00:28:59.876
- Thank you, Julie!
- They had the best time.

475
00:29:03.584 --> 00:29:06.834
Could you go cut his chicken
into non-chokeable pieces?

476
00:29:21.626 --> 00:29:23.126
Hey.

477
00:29:45.293 --> 00:29:47.126
Ow!

478
00:30:06.418 --> 00:30:09.126
Ha-ha.

479
00:30:16.793 --> 00:30:18.126
What? It'll grow back.

480
00:30:18.209 --> 00:30:21.876
You're dressed like a 1950s
astronaut and I'm the weird one?

481
00:30:21.959 --> 00:30:25.251
Oh, now you're threatening
me, Doodlepoo? Do that...

482
00:30:25.334 --> 00:30:28.293
What?

483
00:30:31.043 --> 00:30:33.126
- What...
- Dinnertime, Eli!

484
00:30:34.918 --> 00:30:39.918
Eli, now! You need three hours
to digest your food before bed.

485
00:30:41.709 --> 00:30:44.293
This is totally crazy. You talk?

486
00:30:44.376 --> 00:30:45.459
Just to you.

487
00:30:45.543 --> 00:30:47.751
- 'Cause, uh…
- I'm special?

488
00:30:47.834 --> 00:30:49.501
Uh, yeah, that's right.

489
00:30:50.126 --> 00:30:51.584
Oh. Okay.

490
00:30:51.668 --> 00:30:55.418
But you can't tell anyone.
They'll try to kill me like E.T.

491
00:30:55.501 --> 00:30:58.834
But my parents told me when
someone says, "Don't tell anyone,"

492
00:30:58.918 --> 00:31:00.209
that's when I have to tell.

493
00:31:00.293 --> 00:31:03.626
Well, your parents are right,
but that's with strange humans.

494
00:31:03.709 --> 00:31:05.876
I'm just a strange lizard. Okay?

495
00:31:05.959 --> 00:31:09.959
- Please don't tell. Especially him.
- The drone?

496
00:31:10.043 --> 00:31:13.376
No way. You saw what it did
to the Cheetos out there.

497
00:31:13.459 --> 00:31:15.626
I mean, it's nice
that it's loyal.

498
00:31:15.709 --> 00:31:18.334
Come on. When I was six,
kids thought it was cool.

499
00:31:18.418 --> 00:31:22.709
- Maybe you should say something about it.
- I don't want to hurt its feelings.

500
00:31:23.501 --> 00:31:27.168
I know a way. I've seen kids
break up over the years.

501
00:31:27.251 --> 00:31:29.584
You write down why
you're dumping them,

502
00:31:29.668 --> 00:31:33.126
and it gives the other person
time to soak it in and not snap.

503
00:31:33.209 --> 00:31:35.209
It's a "Dear Drone" letter.

504
00:31:35.293 --> 00:31:36.626
Get a pen and paper.

505
00:31:49.168 --> 00:31:53.168

506
00:31:54.084 --> 00:31:58.834

He knows he's recyclable.

518
00:33:26.043 --> 00:33:28.001
Let's just give him some space.

519
00:33:28.084 --> 00:33:30.418
Nobody's ever gonna
like me like he does.

520
00:33:30.501 --> 00:33:34.626
Kid, they don't even know you. Now
you can finally show your stuff.

521
00:33:34.709 --> 00:33:37.001
Uh, I don't have any stuff.

522
00:33:37.084 --> 00:33:39.626
Ah, you just gotta
find your gimmick.

523
00:33:39.709 --> 00:33:43.293
There was a boy in
1998, Mike Djokovic.

524
00:33:43.376 --> 00:33:46.709
He memorized all the words
to "Walkin' on the Sun."

525
00:33:47.793 --> 00:33:51.584
Smash Mouth? No? Look,
it's got a lot of words.

526
00:33:51.668 --> 00:33:54.376
The point is, plenty
of kids have a gimmick.

527
00:33:54.459 --> 00:33:56.126
It's okay. I got a few.

528
00:33:56.209 --> 00:33:58.876
- Uh, get me a caterpillar.
- For real?

529
00:33:58.959 --> 00:33:59.959
Trust me.

530
00:34:12.668 --> 00:34:13.793
Oh, that's perfect.

531
00:34:13.876 --> 00:34:15.626
Okay, here we go.

532
00:34:15.709 --> 00:34:17.793
So gross!

533
00:34:17.876 --> 00:34:18.876
Wait.

534
00:34:19.584 --> 00:34:21.209
What the...

535
00:34:25.209 --> 00:34:27.459
Here, let me show
you something.

536
00:34:28.418 --> 00:34:30.834
Eli, where's your safety suit?

537
00:34:31.626 --> 00:34:32.793
Try doing this.

538
00:34:48.626 --> 00:34:51.751
Very good.

539
00:34:51.834 --> 00:34:53.001
Fore!

540
00:34:54.293 --> 00:34:56.977
- You nailed that thing.
- What was it? A possum?

541
00:34:57.001 --> 00:34:59.543
I don't know, but you
hit it in the jellybeans.

542
00:34:59.626 --> 00:35:01.626
Wanna quit and go
home? Can't top that.

543
00:35:13.501 --> 00:35:15.209
Not everyone's invited.

544
00:35:28.459 --> 00:35:29.834
Yes, I'm back.

545
00:35:29.918 --> 00:35:32.668
Where's your tail? You
escaping one limb at a time?

546
00:35:32.751 --> 00:35:36.043
Just give me some space. I
got hit in the jellybeans.

547
00:35:37.376 --> 00:35:38.834
I forgot that was there.

548
00:35:40.043 --> 00:35:44.709
Salinas was teacher of the year!
That substitute lady's unacceptable.

549
00:35:44.793 --> 00:35:47.876
Do the skin cream samples I give
out mean nothing to you people?

550
00:35:47.959 --> 00:35:50.418
How do I get that
horrible woman replaced?

551
00:35:50.501 --> 00:35:52.876
Dr. Wenger, please.
She's sitting right here.

552
00:35:52.959 --> 00:35:55.501
- So?
- Jay, it's not polite.

553
00:35:55.584 --> 00:35:56.418
Fine.

554
00:35:56.501 --> 00:35:59.126
May I speak about you
as if you're not here?

555
00:36:03.418 --> 00:36:06.876
Listen, my kid was on track to
get into Westlake next year,

556
00:36:06.959 --> 00:36:09.543
Langley Prep in three years,
Dartmouth in seven years,

557
00:36:09.626 --> 00:36:12.126
then a moderately happy
marriage in 14 years.

558
00:36:12.209 --> 00:36:14.418
I paid for that smart board
and this light switch.

559
00:36:16.126 --> 00:36:18.959
If I'm letting you keep
this animal as her teacher,

560
00:36:19.043 --> 00:36:21.793
you're gonna do something
for me to fix this.

561
00:36:23.459 --> 00:36:27.001
Four seconds. Three, two, one.

562
00:36:27.084 --> 00:36:28.293
Pencils down.

563
00:36:28.376 --> 00:36:30.293
Except Jayda,

564
00:36:30.376 --> 00:36:33.001
who will now be getting
two more minutes

565
00:36:33.084 --> 00:36:36.668
due to her permanent jet lag.

566
00:36:36.751 --> 00:36:39.959
Quiet. No discussion.

567
00:36:40.043 --> 00:36:43.251
Now, one of you has to
take home a class pet.

568
00:36:43.334 --> 00:36:45.376
Volunteer or be assigned.

569
00:36:45.459 --> 00:36:46.626
I'll take Leo again.

570
00:36:46.709 --> 00:36:51.251
- What is the deal? Leo? Again?
- You can't take a pet twice, right?

571
00:36:51.334 --> 00:36:53.668
Because I would... I mean,
why do you want him again?

572
00:36:53.751 --> 00:36:57.126
Um, 'cause he was awesome.

573
00:36:57.209 --> 00:37:00.043
- Why do you want him?
- Uh, same reason. Awesome.

574
00:37:00.126 --> 00:37:02.376
Wait. If it's
awesome, I want it.

575
00:37:02.459 --> 00:37:04.709
It's supposed to
say, "Dr. Skin,"

576
00:37:04.793 --> 00:37:06.084
not "Dr. Skid."

577
00:37:06.168 --> 00:37:08.834
S-K-I-N. No D's.

578
00:37:08.918 --> 00:37:11.334
Jayda, I dyed the cat green.

579
00:37:11.418 --> 00:37:12.626
So unoriginal.

580
00:37:12.709 --> 00:37:14.959
Isn't that great,
what I got for you?

581
00:37:15.043 --> 00:37:18.126
- Drake's coming to my party?
- Eh, I'm still on it.

582
00:37:18.209 --> 00:37:21.043
I meant the pop quiz,
the two more minutes.

583
00:37:21.126 --> 00:37:23.959
- Who takes care of you?
- What did Daddy do?

584
00:37:24.043 --> 00:37:27.918
Well, Benji, Jayda's substitute
teacher is a horror show…

585
00:37:28.001 --> 00:37:30.376
Making the kids read big books.

586
00:37:30.459 --> 00:37:31.293
No!

587
00:37:31.376 --> 00:37:34.251
So Daddy got Jayda
something no other kid gets.

588
00:37:34.334 --> 00:37:35.334

- ♪ Lovin' that extra time ♪

594
00:37:53.793 --> 00:37:58.043
Ugh. It's like the worst day of my
life. Nobody's focusing on my party.

595
00:37:58.126 --> 00:38:01.459
It's going to totally suck, and the
other kids will be happy about it.

596
00:38:01.543 --> 00:38:03.251
What? Why would they be happy?

597
00:38:03.334 --> 00:38:06.584
Because they're all jealous.
Wait. What? Who said that?

598
00:38:06.668 --> 00:38:07.751
That was me.

599
00:38:07.834 --> 00:38:09.751
- Oh my God! You talk?
- No, it's not safe.

600
00:38:09.834 --> 00:38:14.001

- So awesome! We have a talking lizard!

That makes sense. But can
you do tricks at the party?

607
00:38:31.709 --> 00:38:34.084
Can you rap and play the
piano with your tongue?

608
00:38:34.168 --> 00:38:38.501
Nah, this is just between us. I'm
talking to you to give advice.

609
00:38:38.584 --> 00:38:42.543
- I don't need advice. I'm awesome.
- Nah, you're miserable.

Wait, what?

All snotty, all secretly hated.

00:38:55.793 --> 00:38:58.543

Yeah, but we made a bigger list.

659
00:41:10.834 --> 00:41:13.793
- Hi, guys. I'm so glad you came.
- Thanks for inviting us.

660
00:41:13.876 --> 00:41:15.626
Of course. How are you?

661
00:41:15.709 --> 00:41:18.543
Uh, wait. I know
this one. We're fine.

662
00:41:19.626 --> 00:41:22.293
That thing sounded like Cole.

663
00:41:22.376 --> 00:41:25.459
Wow. Zane is funny now?

664
00:41:25.543 --> 00:41:26.959
Zane was always funny.

665
00:41:27.043 --> 00:41:28.209
Like in 2nd grade,

666
00:41:28.293 --> 00:41:32.251
when he told Mrs. Lemos that
Superman came from planet Crouton?

667
00:41:34.334 --> 00:41:37.709
- Hey. You kids try the bubble guy yet?
- Dad, we'll get to the bubbles.

668
00:41:37.793 --> 00:41:40.543
This guy's next level.
He makes bubble animals.

669
00:41:42.668 --> 00:41:45.793
Here you go. Next. You're
not holding it right!

670
00:41:47.418 --> 00:41:49.626
Jayda burgers. Jayda taters.

671
00:41:50.126 --> 00:41:51.709
Jayda vegetables.

672
00:41:51.793 --> 00:41:53.709
Please don't do this.

673
00:42:09.334 --> 00:42:11.293
What're you looking at, boss?

674
00:42:11.376 --> 00:42:13.459
Got a problem with compact legs?

675
00:42:13.543 --> 00:42:14.543
What?

676
00:42:14.584 --> 00:42:17.334
You think you got it so great out
there? What do you do in the box?

677
00:42:17.418 --> 00:42:19.626
Uh, I molt.

678
00:42:19.709 --> 00:42:21.293
Occasional blinking.

679
00:42:21.376 --> 00:42:24.584
All right. I'm sorry, brother.
We're fighting the same fight.

680
00:42:24.668 --> 00:42:27.918
I mean, the only fun I've ever had was
biting some of that guy's fingers off.

681
00:42:28.001 --> 00:42:31.126
I've asked you five times
to jump through this hoop.

682
00:42:31.209 --> 00:42:33.584
I'm just, uh… I'm
getting old, you know?

683
00:42:33.668 --> 00:42:37.876
Ever feel like time's running out,
and this is all we're ever gonna know?

684
00:42:44.251 --> 00:42:47.876
Were you just talking to that
horse? Is he having a good time?

685
00:42:47.959 --> 00:42:49.043
I gotta tell you,

686
00:42:49.126 --> 00:42:52.209
the truth is, no animal
wants to be locked inside...

687
00:42:52.293 --> 00:42:54.876
Hey, Jayda. Hey, Leo. I
can't believe how much cool…

688
00:42:55.501 --> 00:43:00.001
Uh, I mean, hey, just Jayda,
are you having a good time?

689
00:43:00.084 --> 00:43:02.959
Thanks for asking me.
My parents never ask.

690
00:43:03.043 --> 00:43:05.084
They just assume I'm
having a good time,

691
00:43:05.168 --> 00:43:07.668
'cause they still don't
realize they aren't that great.

692
00:43:08.459 --> 00:43:11.918
- What would make you have a better time?
- Good question.

He's just awesome.

720
00:45:24.501 --> 00:45:26.168
Cheese!

721
00:45:28.251 --> 00:45:31.543
- I had so much fun at the party.
- Did you get a bubble animal?

722
00:45:31.626 --> 00:45:33.043
Camel went on the waterslide.

723
00:45:37.543 --> 00:45:41.668
- Again? Whatever happened to zipping?
- Oh, you'll know when I zip.

724
00:45:41.751 --> 00:45:44.543
I'll be in the Everglades
dining on maggots

725
00:45:44.626 --> 00:45:46.626
you can only dream about.

726
00:45:49.793 --> 00:45:52.352
You were fun, Leo.
I'll miss you.

727
00:45:52.376 --> 00:45:55.418
If Santa Claus has 39 elves

728
00:45:55.501 --> 00:45:57.751
making 1,981 toys an hour…

729
00:45:57.834 --> 00:46:00.918
Freezing here. How about
giving a guy some shell?

730
00:46:01.001 --> 00:46:04.001
Wait. Ho, ho, Mr. Popular, now
you wanna come in here with me?

731
00:46:04.084 --> 00:46:05.751
It's 65 degrees.

732
00:46:05.834 --> 00:46:08.543
These Central Florida
winters are brutal.

733
00:46:08.626 --> 00:46:10.543
Just a couple of minutes.

734
00:46:10.626 --> 00:46:13.001
Hey, hey! At least
buy me dinner first.

735
00:46:13.084 --> 00:46:15.584
Wait. Are those
my baseball cards?

736
00:46:32.376 --> 00:46:33.501
Call me.

737
00:46:37.626 --> 00:46:39.459
You're talking to them.

738
00:46:39.543 --> 00:46:42.543
- That's why you keep coming back.
- What? No.

739
00:46:42.626 --> 00:46:43.793
Just a little bit.

740
00:46:43.876 --> 00:46:46.584
No, no, no, no. There is no
little bit. We don't talk to them.

741
00:46:46.668 --> 00:46:50.251
These kids are all benefiting from
my insights before I drop dead.

742
00:46:50.334 --> 00:46:53.834
- Okay, so it's about your ego.
- That's not what this is.

743
00:46:55.501 --> 00:47:00.751
It's about sharing my 74 years of wisdom
to help these kids with their issues.

744
00:47:00.834 --> 00:47:04.293
Whether it's breaking up with the
drone or having hand-me-down pants.

745
00:47:04.376 --> 00:47:05.959
Oh, boo-freakin'-hoo.

746
00:47:06.043 --> 00:47:08.543
I had to wear my sister's
shell till I was 16.

747
00:47:08.626 --> 00:47:11.334
I made a huge difference
with that TJ kid.

748
00:47:12.543 --> 00:47:15.001
What? I don't understand.
That's normal.

749
00:47:15.084 --> 00:47:19.293
First one? Usually, it's in the front,
but very nice. You're growing up.

750
00:47:19.793 --> 00:47:21.709
No, no, no. It's my dad.

751
00:47:27.501 --> 00:47:30.043
What's so funny? I told
him that Dave Connaire,

752
00:47:30.126 --> 00:47:35.376
in 1974, all of a sudden, grew a nose
the size of a Buick just like his dad's.

753
00:47:35.459 --> 00:47:38.918
And everybody still loved him,
'cause he was a cool kid, like you.

754
00:47:39.001 --> 00:47:42.043
And the next week, Cole's
problem was even tougher.

755
00:47:42.126 --> 00:47:45.793
You won't do sleepovers, 'cause
you say things in your sleep?

756
00:47:45.876 --> 00:47:49.334
Well, if I'm not gonna tell
anyone about you talking to me,

757
00:47:49.834 --> 00:47:51.418
do you promise not
to tell anyone?

758
00:47:51.501 --> 00:47:53.751
Yeah. Of course.

759
00:47:53.834 --> 00:47:55.543
This isn't my real voice.

760
00:47:55.626 --> 00:47:59.834
I really talk like this. I can't
let them know. I sound ridiculous.

761
00:47:59.918 --> 00:48:02.459
This is priceless.

762
00:48:02.543 --> 00:48:04.376
Well, I fixed it. I told him…

763
00:48:04.459 --> 00:48:06.793
- You sound like a young Bee Gee.
- A what?

764
00:48:06.876 --> 00:48:08.501
How 'bout The Weeknd? Know him?

765
00:48:12.626 --> 00:48:13.918
Yeah, like that.

766
00:48:14.751 --> 00:48:17.084
Last week, he sang at
the winter recital,

767
00:48:17.168 --> 00:48:19.418
and I heard they went nuts.

768
00:48:20.918 --> 00:48:22.626
Nice job, Ms. Malkin.

769
00:48:22.709 --> 00:48:24.918
I'm sorry, was that praise?

770
00:48:25.001 --> 00:48:28.418
Keep it up, and we may
see more of you here.

771
00:48:28.501 --> 00:48:31.043
- The class did great.
- Did they win?

772
00:48:31.543 --> 00:48:34.001
Nah, kindergarten always
wins. Way too cute.

773
00:48:38.001 --> 00:48:40.543
And you should've seen
me last week with Mia.

774
00:48:40.626 --> 00:48:42.626
You mean Huggy? The
human cling wrap?

775
00:48:42.709 --> 00:48:45.084
Excuse me. She has a name.

776
00:48:45.168 --> 00:48:48.001
As you know, her parents
were recently divorced.

777
00:48:48.084 --> 00:48:51.168
Only two hours late
today. Very considerate.

778
00:48:51.251 --> 00:48:53.751
Are you letting him
cut his own hair now?

779
00:48:56.334 --> 00:48:59.751
You can't watch the kids next
weekend, so me and Aurora can have

780
00:48:59.834 --> 00:49:03.251
Valentine's Day together?
I'm asking you one favor!

781
00:49:03.334 --> 00:49:06.418
You don't have any
plans. Because I know.

782
00:49:06.501 --> 00:49:09.001
I'm sorry, but
lizards do not talk.

783
00:49:09.084 --> 00:49:12.793
Parrots, macaws, songbirds,
and certain killer whales.

784
00:49:12.876 --> 00:49:15.709
Don't believe everything
you read on the Internet.

785
00:49:16.584 --> 00:49:18.626
Why would you only talk to me?

786
00:49:18.709 --> 00:49:23.334
'Cause you're nice. You're great at
school, answering all the questions.

787
00:49:23.418 --> 00:49:27.793
- I love to learn things.
- You're a lot quieter around your family.

788
00:49:27.876 --> 00:49:31.126
Don't you ever wanna let 'em see
how big that brain of yours is?

789
00:49:31.209 --> 00:49:33.751
My brother and sister
think I'm weird.

790
00:49:33.834 --> 00:49:34.876
Really?

791
00:49:37.168 --> 00:49:41.251
- You just looked like my grandpa.
- Yeah? Is that a good thing?

792
00:49:41.334 --> 00:49:42.251
Uh-huh.

793
00:49:42.334 --> 00:49:44.626
My grandpa used to talk to me.

794
00:49:44.709 --> 00:49:48.668
He really liked science, and
he would ask me questions,

795
00:49:48.751 --> 00:49:51.626
even if he knew the answer.

796
00:49:51.709 --> 00:49:53.918
What? He sounds
like a great guy.

797
00:49:54.001 --> 00:49:57.626
He was my best friend.

798
00:49:57.709 --> 00:50:00.418
Oh, no, no, no, no. I didn't
mean to get that going.

799
00:50:00.501 --> 00:50:02.001
Please, kid, I hate that.

800
00:50:02.084 --> 00:50:04.959
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no, no. Don't be sorry.

801
00:50:05.043 --> 00:50:07.043
Just stop. I… I can't handle it.

802
00:50:07.126 --> 00:50:09.418
But my mom says
it's good to cry.

803
00:50:09.501 --> 00:50:12.793
Not where I come from.
Here. Let me calm you down.

804
00:50:12.876 --> 00:50:15.626

831

You're just doing
what my grandpa did,

832
00:51:55.584 --> 00:51:58.876
pretending not to know something,
so I can tell you what's right.

833
00:51:58.959 --> 00:52:01.959
Here. Scientific
research has established

834
00:52:02.043 --> 00:52:05.459
that crying releases
oxytocin and endorphins.

835
00:52:05.543 --> 00:52:09.001
These feel-good chemicals help ease
both physical and emotional pain.

836
00:52:09.084 --> 00:52:13.001
I didn't know how to help her, so
I just listened. And that helped.

837
00:52:13.084 --> 00:52:15.668
Wow. So you got this
E.T. scam going.

838
00:52:15.751 --> 00:52:18.418
Got every kid thinking he's
Elliott? This will end badly.

839
00:52:18.501 --> 00:52:21.209
All I know is these
kids'll remember me.

840
00:52:21.293 --> 00:52:24.126
Did you hear about Hammy
#3's funeral last week?

841
00:52:24.209 --> 00:52:26.751
- Hammy #3 died? Didn't know that.
- Exactly.

842
00:52:26.834 --> 00:52:30.376
They say the funeral was a snooze.
No one had anything to say.

843
00:52:30.459 --> 00:52:33.793
I liked that white
spot over his ear.

844
00:52:33.876 --> 00:52:35.793
I liked the way he breathed.

845
00:52:35.876 --> 00:52:37.501
He gave me pinkeye.

846
00:52:37.584 --> 00:52:41.793
My funeral is gonna be packed with
fond remembrances and anecdotes.

847
00:52:43.459 --> 00:52:46.001
Yeah, good for you and your
last week's vocabulary words.

848
00:52:46.501 --> 00:52:49.959
And, buddy, that funeral could
come sooner than you think.

849
00:52:51.209 --> 00:52:53.793
- Me! Me!
- My turn with the Geico thing!

850
00:52:56.668 --> 00:52:59.334
Have fun, Anthony!
Leo's awesome!

851
00:52:59.418 --> 00:53:03.334
These things heads grow back too? Or
just their tails? I'll figure it out.

852
00:53:03.418 --> 00:53:07.793
Oh, no. Call my next of kin. This
is how I want to divide my estate.

853
00:53:07.876 --> 00:53:08.876
Help me!

854
00:53:11.209 --> 00:53:12.834
- What?
- I got your back.

855
00:53:12.918 --> 00:53:16.001
- I couldn't let you do this one alone.
- What are you gonna do?

856
00:53:16.084 --> 00:53:19.043
You lay back. It's harder
to hurt me. I got the shell.

857
00:53:19.126 --> 00:53:20.793
What about giving advice?

858
00:53:20.876 --> 00:53:24.043
Oh, like I don't know
anything? I can do what you do.

859
00:53:26.626 --> 00:53:28.543
Mm.

860
00:53:28.626 --> 00:53:31.626
That was an incredible
move! What strategy!

861
00:53:31.709 --> 00:53:33.584
- Hey!
- …starting to let his…

862
00:53:33.668 --> 00:53:34.918
Go straight to his head.

863
00:53:35.001 --> 00:53:36.126
Hey, over here.

864
00:53:36.209 --> 00:53:37.709
- What?
- Ah!

865
00:53:39.334 --> 00:53:41.418
- Oh, come on!
- Forget that. I talk.

866
00:53:41.501 --> 00:53:43.876
Oh my God. Grandma!

867
00:53:43.959 --> 00:53:46.376
No, no, no. Stop, stop. Can't
do that or we'll all die.

868
00:53:46.459 --> 00:53:49.168
- What? Why?
- I don't know. I… I'm telling you.

869
00:53:49.251 --> 00:53:52.376
- You… You'll die. Just shut up. Calm down.
- Oh, okay.

870
00:53:52.459 --> 00:53:56.168
Fix your phone later. I'm a talking
turtle. I picked you 'cause…

871
00:53:56.751 --> 00:53:58.084
"I like your style."

872
00:53:58.168 --> 00:54:01.876
- Take it down a notch.
- I got this. Now, tell me your problems.

873
00:54:01.959 --> 00:54:04.709
- What?
- I… I can fix your problems. I… I… I…

874
00:54:04.793 --> 00:54:06.793
I seen a lot of things
in that 5th grade room,

875
00:54:06.876 --> 00:54:08.501
and I can help. So come on.

876
00:54:08.584 --> 00:54:11.334
I don't have any problems.
Other than I broke my phone.

877
00:54:11.418 --> 00:54:13.626
Ah-ha. Bully. I get it.

878
00:54:13.709 --> 00:54:16.376
Come on. You're insecure,
right? Every class bully is.

879
00:54:16.459 --> 00:54:19.126
No. I don't know.

880
00:54:20.251 --> 00:54:22.793
You're sad, you got something
tearing you up inside.

881
00:54:22.876 --> 00:54:26.459
Just say it. I'm a talking
turtle. I can't tell anyone else.

882
00:54:27.668 --> 00:54:30.751
Of course I'm a bully. I
don't know what else to do.

883
00:54:30.834 --> 00:54:36.084
- I'm just different. I'm not smart.
- Nah. Everyone's smart in some way.

884
00:54:36.168 --> 00:54:39.668
You're just afraid of trying and
looking not smart. That's textbook.

885
00:54:39.751 --> 00:54:42.126
- What's a textbook?
- You know what? Never mind.

886
00:54:43.209 --> 00:54:46.793
- I'm different in other ways too.
- There you go. Come on. Out with it.

887
00:54:48.043 --> 00:54:51.793
- You won't say anything?
- No. What is it? What's the sadness?

888
00:54:53.834 --> 00:54:56.418
I don't know how
babies are made.

889
00:54:57.459 --> 00:54:59.459
Perfect. That's
very class bully.

890
00:54:59.543 --> 00:55:00.793
Tough on the outside,

891
00:55:00.876 --> 00:55:03.668
a self-hating pile of
cottage cheese on the inside.

892
00:55:03.751 --> 00:55:07.751
- Can you just tell me?
- Oh. About babies? Sure. Here we go.

893
00:55:07.834 --> 00:55:12.418
First, the daddy climbs on the
mommy's back while she's swimming.

894
00:55:12.501 --> 00:55:14.584
He reaches under the
mommy to find her cloaca.

895
00:55:15.251 --> 00:55:17.293
This goes on for about 24 hours.

896
00:55:18.251 --> 00:55:21.751
Then the mommy comes ashore, makes a
nest, and deposits eggs in the sand.

897
00:55:22.876 --> 00:55:25.668
My mom made eggs in the sand?

898
00:55:25.751 --> 00:55:28.084
Yes. So the fish don't eat 'em.

899
00:55:31.626 --> 00:55:35.084
I crushed it. Totally
fixed the kid's problem.

900
00:55:35.168 --> 00:55:38.459
The taping me up, maybe it's
'cause he wants to keep me.

901
00:55:39.834 --> 00:55:42.084
Stop!

902
00:55:52.793 --> 00:55:55.834
You miss your friends
from being held back.

903
00:55:55.918 --> 00:55:58.418
Worried about being behind?

904
00:55:58.501 --> 00:56:02.709
This is a tough time, but these
are the best years. Believe me.

905
00:56:03.251 --> 00:56:05.501
Enjoy not knowing everything.

906
00:56:05.584 --> 00:56:09.168
Enjoy being a kid.
You're a good one.

907
00:56:09.918 --> 00:56:11.584
Do you miss being a kid?

908
00:56:12.709 --> 00:56:14.876
I'm just glad I'm still here.

909
00:56:17.418 --> 00:56:20.668
Okay, every one of you has
had a weekend with Leo here.

910
00:56:20.751 --> 00:56:25.751
So from here on, you'll be taking
home… What's the turtle's name again?

911
00:56:26.543 --> 00:56:29.584
Squirtle. My name is Squirtle.

912
00:56:30.168 --> 00:56:31.501
I think it's Squirtle.

913
00:56:31.584 --> 00:56:32.793
Squirtle sucks.

914
00:56:32.876 --> 00:56:34.668
I beg your pardon? Why?

915
00:56:34.751 --> 00:56:36.751
I don't know. He just sucks.

916
00:56:37.834 --> 00:56:40.251
- I like Leo, though. He's nice.
- The best.

917
00:56:40.334 --> 00:56:43.834
- Yeah! Come on…
- Leo's better than that turtle.

918
00:56:43.918 --> 00:56:50.043
Oh, stop that noise. Stop it! What
is so special about this reptile?

919
00:56:53.084 --> 00:56:54.751
I like his skin.

920
00:56:55.251 --> 00:56:57.959
His skin is like my
grandma's elbows.

921
00:56:58.043 --> 00:56:58.959
Uh, same.

922
00:56:59.043 --> 00:57:00.209
- Same.
- Same.

923
00:57:00.293 --> 00:57:02.001
- Elbows.
- Same.

924
00:57:02.084 --> 00:57:06.459
All right. If you all so desperately
want to take home that lizard again,

925
00:57:06.543 --> 00:57:08.084
you'll just have to earn it.

926
00:57:08.168 --> 00:57:11.334
I wanna get picked!

927
00:57:11.418 --> 00:57:14.084
We'll do our homework and
promise to bring it in.

928
00:57:14.168 --> 00:57:18.001
You will all make my class
a model of excellence,

929
00:57:18.084 --> 00:57:23.584
and even win that Academicathalon,
or it's the turtle for all of you.

930
00:57:24.501 --> 00:57:26.168
Yes! Thank you so much.

931
00:57:26.251 --> 00:57:29.959
Was this your dying wish? To
turn a bunch of brats against me?

932
00:57:30.043 --> 00:57:32.543
It's not about us.
It's about the kids.

933
00:57:32.626 --> 00:57:33.709
They're motivated.

934
00:57:33.793 --> 00:57:35.793
They're gonna finish
the year strong.

935
00:58:13.251 --> 00:58:14.668
Yes!

936
00:58:22.668 --> 00:58:25.501
Yeah, Louis Pasteur is the
father of microbiology.

937
00:58:25.584 --> 00:58:29.959
He discovered that dangerous
microorganisms could grow in open water.

938
00:58:44.251 --> 00:58:48.626
Wow! Well, now,
that's impressive.

939
00:58:53.626 --> 00:58:58.001
Class 5-C, you're one step away
from going to Magic Land Park!

940
00:58:58.084 --> 00:59:01.376
How great a job has
our teacher done?

941
00:59:01.459 --> 00:59:03.793
Bravo, Ms. Malkin.

942
00:59:03.876 --> 00:59:06.834
I know a lot of parents weren't
happy when I first brought you in,

943
00:59:06.918 --> 00:59:08.918
due to your rep as
a miserable person.

944
00:59:09.001 --> 00:59:12.251
But if you win the History
Fair on Saturday, we'll...

945
00:59:12.334 --> 00:59:14.293
You'll prove all
the doubters wrong.

946
00:59:14.376 --> 00:59:20.293
Well, Principal Spahn, in the classroom,
sometimes the old ways are the best ways.

947
00:59:20.376 --> 00:59:21.976
I can't believe it.

948
00:59:22.043 --> 00:59:25.084
Back to your posts.
No five-highing.

949
00:59:25.168 --> 00:59:28.168
- Oh, that pic is fire.
- Thank you.

950
00:59:28.251 --> 00:59:32.293
Hey, what is the deal? I've been waiting
for your next Jenga move for 30 minutes.

951
00:59:32.376 --> 00:59:34.709
Now did you make the
costume or did your mom?

952
00:59:34.793 --> 00:59:37.459
Tell the truth. You know
I won't tell anyone.

953
00:59:37.543 --> 00:59:39.668
I only talk to you.

954
00:59:39.751 --> 00:59:41.626
- What?
- Is that another phone?

955
00:59:41.709 --> 00:59:45.376
Uh, I don't know. Uh, must be
on Malkin's desk or something.

956
00:59:45.918 --> 00:59:47.001
Oh.

957
00:59:47.084 --> 00:59:48.793
- Hello?
- Come on.

958
00:59:48.876 --> 00:59:51.043
Leo, where'd you go?

959
00:59:51.126 --> 00:59:52.959
I… I'll be right there.

960
00:59:53.793 --> 00:59:55.168
Leo?

961
00:59:56.251 --> 00:59:59.126
- Hello?
- Hey, pal, toss it here. I'll handle it.

962
00:59:59.209 --> 01:00:02.043
Can you hear me?

963
01:00:02.126 --> 01:00:03.459
Leo?

964
01:00:03.543 --> 01:00:06.126
Yeah, I think Malkin
must have an extra phone.

965
01:00:06.209 --> 01:00:08.501
Anywho, what did Summer say?

966
01:00:08.584 --> 01:00:11.959
Oh my God, you can't
all play Jackie Kennedy.

967
01:00:12.043 --> 01:00:15.043
And, like, we so wanna
slay this History Fair.

968
01:00:15.126 --> 01:00:18.459
I know. That Magic Land
Park trip would be awesome.

969
01:00:18.543 --> 01:00:21.668
Hey, you're awesome because
you tried your best.

970
01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:24.060
That's why I'm your
special friend?

971
01:00:24.084 --> 01:00:25.834
Yeah.

972
01:00:27.084 --> 01:00:30.459
You talk to Skyler too?

973
01:00:31.334 --> 01:00:33.584
I… I just… Only because she...

974
01:00:33.668 --> 01:00:36.501
That's Summer's phone in
there, right behind yours.

975
01:00:41.751 --> 01:00:44.709
- You happy now? For ruining this?
- I don't know what happened.

976
01:00:44.793 --> 01:00:47.376
I… I must've butt-dialed
ya. I mean, butt-shot ya.

977
01:00:47.459 --> 01:00:48.959
You don't even have a butt.

978
01:00:49.043 --> 01:00:50.626
How dare you?

979
01:00:52.001 --> 01:00:55.626
- You talk to all of us?
- You said I was the only one.

980
01:00:55.709 --> 01:00:57.418
You said I was the only one.

981
01:00:57.501 --> 01:01:00.418
- I thought I was special.
- You're all special. I...

982
01:01:02.501 --> 01:01:04.668
I'm sorry! I just…

983
01:01:04.751 --> 01:01:08.793
Seeing you guys getting along
and doing great in class,

984
01:01:08.876 --> 01:01:12.001
it felt like I was actually
making a difference.

985
01:01:12.084 --> 01:01:15.543
You did. This year would've been a
nightmare without you helping me.

986
01:01:15.626 --> 01:01:19.626
Ms. Malkin's so mean. Talking
to you made the class bearable.

987
01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:23.168
I was just worried
if you all knew…

988
01:01:23.251 --> 01:01:25.209
…other people would find out.

989
01:01:25.293 --> 01:01:27.418
You told me not to tell
anyone, and I didn't.

990
01:01:27.501 --> 01:01:30.918
- Nobody did. Because we can keep a secret.
- Yeah.

991
01:01:31.001 --> 01:01:33.918
What, did you tell everyone
I shave my unibrow?

992
01:01:34.793 --> 01:01:36.084
Because I don't.

993
01:01:36.168 --> 01:01:39.001
Hey, the only one he
told about your unibrow,

994
01:01:39.084 --> 01:01:41.376
or that you still eat
your boogers, was me.

995
01:01:41.459 --> 01:01:43.709
- And I barely chuckled.
- What?

996
01:01:43.793 --> 01:01:44.834
I'm leaving.

997
01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:46.168
I tried.

998
01:01:46.251 --> 01:01:47.834
Wait, it's Friday.

999
01:01:47.918 --> 01:01:50.209
Aren't you gonna take me home?

1000
01:01:50.293 --> 01:01:52.376
Summer, it's your turn.

1001
01:01:52.459 --> 01:01:54.626
Please, I'm so sorry.

1002
01:01:54.709 --> 01:01:57.959
How can we trust you
now? That was a question.

1003
01:02:00.584 --> 01:02:03.043
All right, what's
everyone doing here?

1004
01:02:03.126 --> 01:02:05.668
Oh, you're leaving. Good.
Take the whole day off.

1005
01:02:05.751 --> 01:02:09.418
You need to rest up for the
history fair tomorrow. Go home.

1006
01:02:09.501 --> 01:02:11.876
Go. Shoo. Come on, out you go.

1007
01:02:18.793 --> 01:02:21.543
You and I have a
lot to talk about.

1008
01:02:23.876 --> 01:02:24.751
I don't understand.

1009
01:02:24.834 --> 01:02:27.918
I… I know I lied to the
kids. What did I do to you?

1010
01:02:28.001 --> 01:02:32.876
Excuse me, talking to my students
behind my back? Advising them?

1011
01:02:32.959 --> 01:02:35.876
Okay. I feel terrible, but
I was just trying to...

1012
01:02:35.959 --> 01:02:37.668
Undermine my methods!

1013
01:02:37.751 --> 01:02:40.918
Cheat me out of feeling any
satisfaction from their success.

1014
01:02:41.001 --> 01:02:44.918
What? They learned everything you
wanted. Why wouldn't that make you happy?

1015
01:02:45.001 --> 01:02:48.043
Don't think you can
analyze me. I'm an adult.

1016
01:02:48.126 --> 01:02:52.084
Not a shrieking brat who thinks
reading Canterbury Tales is torture.

1017
01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:53.209
It's not torture?

1018
01:02:53.293 --> 01:02:54.334
Quiet!

1019
01:02:54.418 --> 01:02:59.293
Asking me to be happy when I have
nothing but these four walls.

1020
01:02:59.376 --> 01:03:03.584
- What about your family?
- Excuse me, do you see any family?

1021
01:03:03.668 --> 01:03:07.126
Oh. Uh, not unless you're
related to the gym coach.

1022
01:03:07.626 --> 01:03:10.584
- Those pictures are none of your business.
- Gotcha. Never saw 'em.

1023
01:03:11.334 --> 01:03:16.876
I put my whole life into teaching
just to be a mere substitute.

1024
01:03:18.168 --> 01:03:21.709
Never had my own class,
never got any respect.

Like seeing the Everglades,
or spreading Salmonella.

1029
01:03:34.793 --> 01:03:37.918
But this year, I fell into
something even better.

1030
01:03:38.001 --> 01:03:40.293
I really clicked
with these kids.

1031
01:03:40.376 --> 01:03:45.668
Uh, maybe it helped, just a little,
that you're a talking animal?

1032
01:03:45.751 --> 01:03:48.376
Yeah, but also, maybe it's you.

1033
01:03:48.459 --> 01:03:51.626

That's what great teachers
do. Even substitutes.

1057
01:04:52.084 --> 01:04:55.418
With the little time they have,
they try to make a difference.

1058

01:05:45.834 --> 01:05:48.918
- Oh, you're coming with me.
- No, please. They're mad.

1073
01:05:49.001 --> 01:05:50.959
Let… Let them focus on winning.

1074
01:05:51.043 --> 01:05:52.876
Well, I'm still taking you.

1075
01:05:52.959 --> 01:05:53.793
After they win,

1076
01:05:53.876 --> 01:05:56.959
we'll make sure they appreciate
all you were doing for them.

1077
01:05:57.918 --> 01:06:00.793
You know what? You are special.

1078
01:06:04.918 --> 01:06:06.668
I couldn't sleep last night.

1079
01:06:06.751 --> 01:06:09.751
I couldn't stop thinking
about what Leo did to us.

1080
01:06:09.834 --> 01:06:12.918
Let's just not talk about
Leo. We're done with Leo.

1081
01:06:13.001 --> 01:06:15.251
We're ready. We can win
this thing ourselves.

1082
01:06:15.334 --> 01:06:18.959
Good morning, my dear students.

1083
01:06:22.959 --> 01:06:26.959
- They look confident.
- You sounded nice. Real warm.

1084
01:06:27.043 --> 01:06:29.251
Thank you. I'll keep
you posted when I can.

1085
01:06:35.001 --> 01:06:36.126
I'm Betsy Ross.

1086
01:06:36.209 --> 01:06:39.543
I designed the first
American Flag in 1776.

1087
01:06:39.626 --> 01:06:42.584
But I didn't just say what I
thought the flag should look like,

1088
01:06:42.668 --> 01:06:45.001
I listened to others to
see what they thought.

1089
01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:47.626
The result was the superior
design we have today,

1090
01:06:47.709 --> 01:06:49.251
and also, people liking me more.

1091
01:06:50.543 --> 01:06:51.959
I'm Susan B. Anthony.

1092
01:06:52.043 --> 01:06:54.543
I played a pivotal role in
the women's suffrage movement

1093
01:06:54.626 --> 01:06:56.168
in the 19th century.

1094
01:06:56.251 --> 01:06:59.459
But I'm not that special or
great. And neither is my family.

1095
01:06:59.543 --> 01:07:03.668
So I can relate to average women
who couldn't vote until 1920.

1096
01:07:03.751 --> 01:07:06.959
I'm Winston Churchill. "We
shall fight on the beaches."

1097
01:07:07.043 --> 01:07:09.709
"We shall fight them in the
fields and in the streets."

1098
01:07:09.793 --> 01:07:11.126
"We shall never surrender,

1099
01:07:11.209 --> 01:07:13.876
but we shall let them down
easy, with a nice letter."

1100
01:07:13.959 --> 01:07:16.709
- "So they don't lose their minds."
- This is wonderful.

1101
01:07:16.793 --> 01:07:18.751
You've taught them life lessons.

1102
01:07:18.834 --> 01:07:21.376
I… I can't hear anything.
Can you open your pocket?

1103
01:07:21.459 --> 01:07:25.959
They burned me, Joan of Arc, at
the stake, but I am not afraid.

1104
01:07:26.043 --> 01:07:29.001
Boo-freaking-hoo!
Everyone's got problems.

1105
01:07:29.084 --> 01:07:32.584
I talked about it to a
friend and felt a lot better.

1106
01:07:34.084 --> 01:07:38.459
Aw, I think that friend is you.

1107
01:07:39.543 --> 01:07:43.751
Malkin's Marvels, you're
going to Magic Land Park!

1108
01:07:43.834 --> 01:07:46.876
Congratulations, class!

1109
01:07:46.959 --> 01:07:47.793
Yeah!

1110
01:07:47.876 --> 01:07:52.626
And to the first substitute to
ever win Teacher of the Year!

1111
01:07:54.626 --> 01:07:58.501
You'll be chaperoned by Ms.
Malkin and Coach Kimura.

1112
01:07:58.584 --> 01:08:00.543
Oh…

1113
01:08:00.626 --> 01:08:03.751
Is it over? We win?
When do I come out?

1114
01:08:03.834 --> 01:08:05.251
What's happening?

1115
01:08:06.293 --> 01:08:08.668
Ms. Malkin, can we go see Leo?

1116
01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:12.459
- Honey, it's about to rain.
- We can't go to our class for one second?

1117
01:08:12.543 --> 01:08:15.709
You know what the rain
does to my extensions.

1118
01:08:15.793 --> 01:08:18.876
I gotta say, I thought you were
some kind of a twisted animal.

1119
01:08:18.959 --> 01:08:22.584
A rabid, bitter bag of
mothballs foaming at the mouth.

1120
01:08:22.668 --> 01:08:27.584
But I've never seen my Jayda speak
like that. It's like she's, uh, nice?

1121
01:08:27.668 --> 01:08:29.001
That's our Ms. Malkin!

1122
01:08:29.084 --> 01:08:30.959
You really got
to know our kids.

1123
01:08:31.043 --> 01:08:34.126
- What a special lady.
- Get this woman a full-time job next year.

1124
01:08:34.209 --> 01:08:36.376
Oh, I think we
can arrange that.

1125
01:08:36.459 --> 01:08:38.668
She's helped Summer
make friends.

1126
01:08:38.751 --> 01:08:40.977
Cole's proud of his
voice, thanks to you.

1127
01:08:41.001 --> 01:08:43.126
- How'd you do it?
- Well… You know…

1128
01:08:45.751 --> 01:08:48.209
That's, um… my stomach.
I… I better go.

1129
01:08:49.501 --> 01:08:51.834
She's not gonna make it.

1130
01:08:52.584 --> 01:08:54.584
What happened? I
couldn't hear nothing.

1131
01:08:54.668 --> 01:08:57.168
Did we win? I thought I
was gonna see the kids.

1132
01:08:57.251 --> 01:08:59.418
We're going somewhere
very special.

1133
01:08:59.501 --> 01:09:01.418
We're all going to celebrate?

1134
01:09:01.501 --> 01:09:02.709
What, a pizza party?

1135
01:09:05.626 --> 01:09:07.876
Wow, this pizza's
out in the boonies.

1136
01:09:13.668 --> 01:09:16.751
What's goin' on?
You're leaving me here?

1137
01:09:16.834 --> 01:09:18.293
What about the kids?

1138
01:09:18.376 --> 01:09:22.168
They lost. The class embarrassed
themselves and blamed you.

1139
01:09:22.251 --> 01:09:25.001
What? What was
all that cheering?

1140
01:09:25.084 --> 01:09:27.834
That was for the other
class. I'm sorry.

1141
01:09:27.918 --> 01:09:31.001
What did I do? I've
never felt so bad.

1142
01:09:31.084 --> 01:09:33.501
Don't say that. You said the
Everglades was your dream.

1143
01:09:33.584 --> 01:09:36.959
Now you can live it out, with no chance
of ever running into the children.

1144
01:09:37.043 --> 01:09:40.418
Or their parents. Or the
principal. Or the media.

1145
01:09:41.251 --> 01:09:43.084
I said it was my dream.

1146
01:09:43.168 --> 01:09:45.293
The kids are what I...

1147
01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:15.185
- What?
- Where is he?

1148
01:10:15.209 --> 01:10:17.227
- Is he hiding?
- He's not hiding.

1149
01:10:17.251 --> 01:10:18.084
He was here.

1150
01:10:18.168 --> 01:10:19.876
- You seen him?
- What happened?

1151
01:10:19.959 --> 01:10:23.126
What a shame. He
must've run away.

1152
01:10:32.001 --> 01:10:35.043
- He left us?
- Oh, look.

1153
01:10:35.626 --> 01:10:38.084
There seems to be
some kind of note.

1154
01:10:38.168 --> 01:10:41.584
- Leo could write?
- Of course. He could talk.

1155
01:10:41.668 --> 01:10:47.084
Oh! He talked to you people too?
Oh, I thought I was special.

1156
01:10:49.501 --> 01:10:50.751
"Dear class."

1157
01:10:50.834 --> 01:10:53.668
"I've greatly enjoyed my
time with you this year,

1158
01:10:53.751 --> 01:10:57.376
but I wish to move on and
finally see the world."

1159
01:10:57.459 --> 01:11:01.043
"I realize I broke your trust,
and that can't be fixed."

1160
01:11:01.751 --> 01:11:03.501
"But if you would be so kind,

1161
01:11:03.584 --> 01:11:07.084
please keep our conversations
secret, so that I'm not harassed,

1162
01:11:07.168 --> 01:11:10.126
like E.T. or The Iron
Giant, or Splash,

1163
01:11:10.209 --> 01:11:13.793
or the classic, The
Shape of Water."

1164
01:11:13.876 --> 01:11:18.209
"Simply attribute your
success to Ms. Malkin,

1165
01:11:18.293 --> 01:11:21.751
whose integrity is
beyond reproach."

1166
01:11:22.251 --> 01:11:24.251
"Best Regards, Leo."

1167
01:11:25.376 --> 01:11:30.418
Well, let's try and be happy for
Leo. He's doing what he wanted most.

1168
01:11:30.501 --> 01:11:33.001
But we never even
got to thank him.

1169
01:11:33.084 --> 01:11:37.334
That's life, gang. Life gets
more difficult the older we get.

1170
01:11:38.543 --> 01:11:40.084
It's called growing up.

Wipe the chair and
the safety bar.

1206
01:14:02.334 --> 01:14:05.043
Doesn't matter what the teacher
says, you call us every half hour.

1207
01:14:05.126 --> 01:14:07.459
And don't lick anything.

1208
01:14:07.543 --> 01:14:11.001
They tried to put the shift on Kabir
when he was up, but guess what?

1209
01:14:11.084 --> 01:14:13.418
- He can hit to right field too.
- Oh!

1210
01:14:13.501 --> 01:14:15.126
That is something.

1211
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:19.626
- What do you think Leo's doing right now?
- I have no idea.

1212
01:14:31.918 --> 01:14:35.584
Sure, kids, why flip over the
musty old turtle before you leave?

1213
01:14:35.668 --> 01:14:39.001
Even though he knows the
truth? But no, everyone's gone!

1214
01:14:39.084 --> 01:14:41.334
Everyone but me
and that pathetic…

1215
01:14:41.418 --> 01:14:44.168
Wait. Where's the
allergy kid's phone? Ah.

1216
01:14:47.709 --> 01:14:49.001
Ha.

1217
01:14:49.084 --> 01:14:50.084
Here we go.

1218
01:15:13.418 --> 01:15:15.626
There's no time for
lettuce. Flip me!

1219
01:15:16.293 --> 01:15:17.376
Okay, we gotta move!

1220
01:15:20.918 --> 01:15:22.376
Follow those brats!

1221
01:15:24.459 --> 01:15:26.251
Hey.

1222
01:15:26.334 --> 01:15:29.126
Shake it off, man. You're
freaking everyone out.

1223
01:15:38.084 --> 01:15:39.501
Okay, let's hit it.

1224
01:16:11.709 --> 01:16:13.209
Ouch.

1225
01:16:14.418 --> 01:16:17.376
This is our last
field trip together.

1226
01:16:17.459 --> 01:16:19.251
Why does it feel like our worst?

1227
01:16:21.334 --> 01:16:22.459
What?

1228
01:16:31.793 --> 01:16:33.793

1230
01:16:35.459 --> 01:16:38.126
- What is going on back here?
- She did it!

1231
01:16:38.209 --> 01:16:41.376
- Excuse me?
- I saw it. I saw the whole thing.

1232
01:16:41.459 --> 01:16:44.418
She took him out of the terrarium
after you guys left that day.

1233
01:16:44.501 --> 01:16:46.584
She took him, and I
wanted to say something,

1234
01:16:46.668 --> 01:16:47.876
but her and her vacuum,

1235
01:16:47.959 --> 01:16:51.543
they gave me the stink eye, and I
slipped on, uh, somebody else's pee,

1236
01:16:51.626 --> 01:16:54.209
and I flipped on my back, and
this whole thing is my fault

1237
01:16:54.293 --> 01:16:57.209
'cause I got jealous of my best
friend instead of being happy for him.

1238
01:16:57.293 --> 01:17:01.043
I used the camera phone to bust him,
but now I gotta bust you, Demeritface!

1239
01:17:01.126 --> 01:17:05.126
He's lying! This turtle can't
be trusted. He turned on Leo.

1240
01:17:05.209 --> 01:17:09.209
Come on. You all know Leo's the
reason you got this stupid trip.

1241
01:17:09.293 --> 01:17:11.459
He helped you with your
weird kid problems.

1242
01:17:11.543 --> 01:17:12.668
That's why you won.

1243
01:17:12.751 --> 01:17:16.418
He wanted to do something meaningful
with the rest of his pathetic time,

1244
01:17:16.501 --> 01:17:17.334
and he did it.

1245
01:17:17.418 --> 01:17:19.293
Why did you say, "The
rest of his time"?

1246
01:17:19.376 --> 01:17:21.043
- He's dying!
- What?!

1247
01:17:21.126 --> 01:17:23.751
He's gonna be 75. That's
lights out for lizards.

1248
01:17:23.834 --> 01:17:25.251
- Oh, no!
- He's dying?

1249
01:17:25.334 --> 01:17:27.918
But does Demeritface care? No!

1250
01:17:28.001 --> 01:17:30.709
All Demeritface wants
is all the credit!

1251
01:17:30.793 --> 01:17:32.084
Another lie!

1252
01:17:32.168 --> 01:17:34.251
Then where is he, Ms. Misery?

1253
01:17:34.334 --> 01:17:37.168
Where's my best friend,
Demeritface? Where is he?

1254
01:17:37.251 --> 01:17:40.209
- Out with it, Demeritface!

- Stop it! Stop it! Stop it now!

1257
01:17:58.626 --> 01:18:02.459
I took him, and
I drove him away.

1258
01:18:02.543 --> 01:18:04.626
- That's crazy! Seriously?
- I can't believe you!

1259
01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:08.126
He's right, I wanted the credit.

1260
01:18:08.626 --> 01:18:10.418

01:18:16.668 --> 01:18:19.334
The Everglades.

1264
01:18:19.418 --> 01:18:22.293
You sent him to the Glades?
That's a terrible neighborhood!

1265
01:18:22.376 --> 01:18:26.459
- Those crazy animals will rip him apart!
- Ms. Malkin, please help us find him.

1266
01:18:26.543 --> 01:18:28.501
We can't not see him again.

1267
01:18:35.001 --> 01:18:35.834
Hey there.

1268
01:18:35.918 --> 01:18:39.126
We need to change course.
We're going to the Everglades.

1269
01:18:39.209 --> 01:18:41.043
What? We're going
to Magic Land Park!

1270
01:18:41.126 --> 01:18:44.168
That's what the parents expect,
and that's where we're goin'.

1271
01:18:44.251 --> 01:18:46.626
Oh my, our first fight.

1272
01:18:57.668 --> 01:18:59.626
Thank you. I'm fine.

1273
01:19:00.959 --> 01:19:04.584
Children, we're going
to Magic Land Park.

1274
01:19:15.543 --> 01:19:20.334
Thanks, but a little too murky for me.
How… How close are we to a drip tube?

1275
01:19:20.834 --> 01:19:23.376
Seriously, the
microorganisms will kill you.

1276
01:19:23.459 --> 01:19:24.834
A kid told me that.

1277
01:19:24.918 --> 01:19:27.168
You guys never heard
of Louis Pasteur?

1278
01:19:41.501 --> 01:19:43.876
What the…

1279
01:19:44.459 --> 01:19:47.626
- Someone help me out here.
- Boss, is that you?

1280
01:19:49.543 --> 01:19:50.584
Wha... What?

1281
01:19:50.668 --> 01:19:54.209
Hey, that's the guy! The guy
who set us free at that party.

1282
01:19:54.293 --> 01:19:56.293
That's the guy?

1283
01:19:56.376 --> 01:19:58.959
That's the guy.

1284
01:20:01.668 --> 01:20:04.918
I don't know what Grandma's thinking.
We'll save him on our own, let's go.

1285
01:20:09.418 --> 01:20:11.626
Get this guy some algae.

1286
01:20:14.251 --> 01:20:17.293
And some of you.

1287
01:20:17.376 --> 01:20:20.834
Boss, you're gonna love it here.
No trainers telling you what to do,

1288
01:20:20.918 --> 01:20:24.084
no bratty kids joking
about your compact legs.

1289
01:20:24.584 --> 01:20:26.376
But I miss those kids.

1290
01:20:26.459 --> 01:20:27.334
What?

1291
01:20:27.418 --> 01:20:30.584
They're not bratty. You
just gotta get to know them.

1292
01:20:30.668 --> 01:20:34.501
Like this one kid whose father's
back had a gorilla situation.

1293
01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:41.459
I got this. You go
back to the kids.

1294
01:20:44.584 --> 01:20:46.543
Hey, anybody see
a buddy of mine?

1295
01:20:46.626 --> 01:20:49.501
He's green with bumps,
got a tail, wicked ugly.

1296
01:20:51.459 --> 01:20:53.334
Okay, moving on.

1297
01:20:57.251 --> 01:20:59.227
- We're here, y'all!
- Yes!

1298
01:20:59.251 --> 01:21:00.834
And I'm hungry.

1299
01:21:00.918 --> 01:21:03.376
- Let's do this.
- Hi, welcome to Magic Land Park.

1300
01:21:03.459 --> 01:21:05.043
- Okay. Let me get...
- A Cotton Dragon!

1301
01:21:05.126 --> 01:21:06.918
- A Wizard Puffs, please?
- Me too!

1302
01:21:07.001 --> 01:21:08.834
- I'll take a Unicorn Balls.
- Huh?

1303
01:21:08.918 --> 01:21:10.501
They're jawbreakers. Please?

1304
01:21:10.584 --> 01:21:12.793
Okay, gang. You
getting all of this?

1305
01:21:12.876 --> 01:21:14.959
Oh, and I need one
Fireblower hat.

1306
01:21:16.043 --> 01:21:19.126
Okie doke. Now we're
ready, am I right, kids?

1307
01:21:21.168 --> 01:21:22.668
Are you kidding me? Hey!

1308
01:21:22.751 --> 01:21:25.043
- Go! Run fast!
- Come on. Move it!

1309
01:21:25.126 --> 01:21:27.793
Come on!

1310
01:21:34.334 --> 01:21:36.001
Oh my God!

1311
01:21:39.668 --> 01:21:41.834
- Come on, Ms. Malkin. Hurry up.
- Faster!

1312
01:21:41.918 --> 01:21:44.293
Just go. Go without me!

1313
01:21:44.376 --> 01:21:46.251
But you have to drive us!

1314
01:21:47.959 --> 01:21:49.668
Come on!

1315
01:21:59.293 --> 01:22:02.209
Come on, Ms. Malkin!

1316
01:22:03.501 --> 01:22:04.376
Huh?

1317
01:22:04.459 --> 01:22:05.459
The Purell!

1318
01:22:12.293 --> 01:22:14.959
Whoever did this
will pay! Help!

1319
01:22:15.043 --> 01:22:16.751
He's coming!

1320
01:22:16.834 --> 01:22:19.084
- We have to get out of here!
- I got this!

1321
01:22:19.168 --> 01:22:20.501
- What?
- I'm from the Bronx.

1322
01:22:20.584 --> 01:22:23.102
I've been driving
since I was eight.

1323
01:22:28.418 --> 01:22:31.084
- Yeah! Yeah! Do it!
- Woo-hoo!

1324
01:22:33.459 --> 01:22:35.060
Oh my God!

1325
01:22:35.084 --> 01:22:36.876
Hey, pick a lane, lady!

1326
01:22:40.126 --> 01:22:41.251
A-ha!

1327
01:22:41.334 --> 01:22:43.293
I knew it. Leo?

1328
01:22:45.668 --> 01:22:50.251
Hey! Whoa, whoa. No. No, no,
no, no, no. I hate it out here!

1329
01:22:50.334 --> 01:22:54.584
And I explained to them, I was
just afraid someone would tell.

1330
01:22:54.668 --> 01:22:56.543
But now they're all mad at me,

1331
01:22:56.626 --> 01:23:00.709
and my funeral's gonna be
even worse than Hammy #3's.

1332
01:23:00.793 --> 01:23:03.459
- Who's Hammy #3?
- I think it's a sandwich at Arby's.

1333
01:23:03.543 --> 01:23:05.376
Why you talking
about your funeral?

1334
01:23:05.459 --> 01:23:07.543
'Cause it's coming any day.

1335
01:23:07.626 --> 01:23:09.709
I'm almost 75 years old.

1336
01:23:09.793 --> 01:23:12.459
So what? We live to, like, 110.

1337
01:23:12.543 --> 01:23:14.668
What? But Skyler's dad said...

1338
01:23:14.751 --> 01:23:17.626
A hundred and ten, unless
eaten by alligators.

1339
01:23:17.709 --> 01:23:19.001
I'm 97.

1340
01:23:19.084 --> 01:23:22.626
A hundred six. He's
74? He's a tween.

1341
01:23:22.709 --> 01:23:24.376
Look how fast he blinks.

1342
01:23:27.501 --> 01:23:31.293
I'm gonna live!
This is incredible!

1343
01:23:31.376 --> 01:23:33.126
The guy's gonna live!

1344
01:23:33.209 --> 01:23:35.709
The guy's gonna live!
The guy's gonna live!

1345
01:23:35.793 --> 01:23:38.709
I gotta get back to those
kids. I can redeem myself!

1346
01:23:38.793 --> 01:23:40.293
And we're gonna help you.

1347
01:23:40.376 --> 01:23:43.251
The guy's gonna live! The...

1348
01:23:43.334 --> 01:23:47.084
I said I was sorry!

1349
01:23:49.251 --> 01:23:51.501
I'd kill for lateral movement.

1350
01:23:57.084 --> 01:24:01.668
Guys, before you do anything, let's
talk about why you're angry, okay?

1351
01:24:02.168 --> 01:24:03.584
Anyone's parents
getting divorced?

1352
01:24:07.751 --> 01:24:09.501
- Aren't you gonna stop?
- I'm trying.

1353
01:24:09.584 --> 01:24:12.209
But I weigh 80 pounds
and this thing needs oil.

1354
01:24:12.876 --> 01:24:16.668
This looks scary. Oh, my God.

1355
01:24:19.293 --> 01:24:21.209
Come on!

1356
01:24:28.751 --> 01:24:31.084
What the… Is that some
kind of woolly mammoth?

1357
01:24:31.168 --> 01:24:32.848
I don't know, but it
could kill us, right?

1358
01:24:32.876 --> 01:24:34.501
Uh, definitely.

1359
01:24:38.418 --> 01:24:39.418
We're here.

1360
01:24:45.834 --> 01:24:47.043
Get back.

1361
01:24:47.126 --> 01:24:48.806
- Oh, gosh.
- Oh, no, no, no.

1362
01:24:50.376 --> 01:24:52.543
That's a demerit.

1363
01:25:01.209 --> 01:25:03.418
You need to chill.

1364
01:25:15.126 --> 01:25:16.376
Summer, talk to him.

1365
01:25:16.459 --> 01:25:18.727
So I don't know if you know,
but it doesn't really matter.

1366
01:25:18.751 --> 01:25:21.126
We were supposed to go to
Magic Land, which is cool.

1367
01:25:21.209 --> 01:25:24.168
I've never been there. I don't
like magic and roller coasters.

1368
01:25:24.251 --> 01:25:27.418
They just seem really boring.
They're scary, which isn't boring,

1369
01:25:27.501 --> 01:25:29.543
but you're not doing
anything, you're just sitting,

1370
01:25:29.626 --> 01:25:32.084
when you could be playing
soccer or baking a cake.

1371
01:25:32.168 --> 01:25:35.084
I mean, my mom's
on a diet, so...

1372
01:25:49.918 --> 01:25:52.543
How could Leo ever
survive out here?

1373
01:25:52.626 --> 01:25:55.001
How do we even start
looking for him?

1374
01:25:55.084 --> 01:25:56.959
I just don't know.

1375
01:26:09.126 --> 01:26:11.834
What? Leo, no!

1376
01:26:11.918 --> 01:26:14.043
- Oh, no. Leo!
- Leo!

1377
01:26:15.251 --> 01:26:18.251
Leo, we just wanted
to thank you.

1378
01:26:18.834 --> 01:26:21.668
I'm so sorry I got
mad. We all are.

1379
01:26:22.334 --> 01:26:25.334
We won the trip, Leo.
All because of you.

1380
01:26:25.418 --> 01:26:28.084
You made me feel like
I could do anything.

1381
01:26:28.168 --> 01:26:29.626
You brought us all together.

1382
01:26:29.709 --> 01:26:32.334
I never had a lizard
that taught me so much.

1383
01:26:32.418 --> 01:26:34.459
Or any non-lizards either.

1384
01:26:34.543 --> 01:26:39.001
I'm not scared. I wanna
hug you one more time.

1385
01:26:40.751 --> 01:26:43.084
What? They ate his insides!

1386
01:26:43.168 --> 01:26:45.418
I'm not...

1387
01:26:49.043 --> 01:26:51.126
Huh?

1388
01:26:51.209 --> 01:26:54.001
I'm okay, pal.

1389
01:26:54.084 --> 01:26:56.394
- I can't believe it.
- You're all right.

1390
01:26:56.418 --> 01:27:00.334
Sorry I scared you. When I
get nervous, I tend to molt.

1391
01:27:00.418 --> 01:27:01.334
Old habit.

1392
01:27:01.418 --> 01:27:02.293
Awesome!

1393
01:27:03.793 --> 01:27:08.001
That was the best funeral
I could ever have.

1394
01:27:08.084 --> 01:27:10.293
Wait, but if you guys won,

1395
01:27:10.376 --> 01:27:13.418
shouldn't you be celebrating
in Magic Land Park?

1396
01:27:13.501 --> 01:27:17.876
We couldn't celebrate. We needed
to see you before you die.

1397
01:27:17.959 --> 01:27:21.043
Oh. Uh, who told
you I was dying?

1398
01:27:21.126 --> 01:27:23.043
The turt... Uh,
Squirtle told us.

1399
01:27:23.126 --> 01:27:27.251
Well, I thought I was,
but I found out I'm not.

1400
01:27:27.334 --> 01:27:29.126
- You're not?
- You're not gonna die?

1401
01:27:29.209 --> 01:27:30.376
You're not still mad?

1402
01:27:30.459 --> 01:27:31.959
This is incredible.

1403
01:27:32.043 --> 01:27:34.043
- We love you, Leo.
- Are you crazy?

1404
01:27:34.126 --> 01:27:35.501
This is amazing!

1405
01:27:35.584 --> 01:27:37.501
I'm so happy!

1406
01:27:38.584 --> 01:27:43.334
You're right about the endorphins.
It really feels awesome.

1407
01:27:47.959 --> 01:27:49.793
Ah. Oh, boy! Ah!

1408
01:27:49.876 --> 01:27:52.126
Still coming. Give me a second.

1409
01:27:53.209 --> 01:27:56.876
Hey, glad you're okay.
Sorry about busting you.

1410
01:27:57.793 --> 01:27:59.251
I want you to have something.

1411
01:28:04.084 --> 01:28:06.376
- Least I could do.
- It's okay. Put it back on.

1412
01:28:06.459 --> 01:28:07.793
You're gonna get arrested.

1413
01:28:13.793 --> 01:28:18.751
You should all be proud. We've
all learned so much this year.

1414
01:28:18.834 --> 01:28:22.126
Now, before I go, I want
to finish something else

1415
01:28:22.209 --> 01:28:23.793
that Mrs. Salinas started.

1416
01:28:25.043 --> 01:28:28.376
I'm going to read the
rest of Charlotte's Web.

1417
01:28:28.459 --> 01:28:31.293
- Ugh, is she kidding?
- Let's just get through it.

1418
01:28:32.084 --> 01:28:33.501
"Charlotte was dying."

1419
01:28:34.001 --> 01:28:36.334
"'But I feel
peaceful, ' she said."

1420
01:28:36.418 --> 01:28:41.418
"'Your success in the ring was,
to a small degree, my success.'"

1421
01:28:41.501 --> 01:28:44.168
"'Why did you do all this
for me?' Wilbur asked."

1422
01:28:44.918 --> 01:28:47.334
"'Because I liked you,
' replied Charlotte."

1423
01:28:47.418 --> 01:28:49.959
"'After all, what's
life, anyway?'"

1424
01:28:50.043 --> 01:28:52.959
"'We're born, we live a
little while, we die.'"

1425
01:28:54.001 --> 01:28:56.876
"'Perhaps, I was trying to
lift my life a trifle.'"

1426
01:28:56.959 --> 01:29:00.209
"'Anyone's life can
stand a little of…'"

1427
01:29:00.293 --> 01:29:04.876
What? I was wrong, okay?
Crying's doin' so good for me.

1428
01:29:06.084 --> 01:29:10.084
- Still wish I could eat spider babies.
- Nobody's eating any spider babies!

1429
01:29:10.168 --> 01:29:11.834
Hi, guys!

1430
01:29:11.918 --> 01:29:13.126
Mrs. Salinas.

1431
01:29:13.209 --> 01:29:16.001
- I missed you. Come meet Cole!
- Yes!

1432
01:29:16.084 --> 01:29:18.793
- Can I hold the baby?
- He's so tiny.

1433
01:29:18.876 --> 01:29:20.001
Only one baby.

1434
01:29:20.084 --> 01:29:23.209
I guess she didn't bury the other
eggs deep enough in the sand.
