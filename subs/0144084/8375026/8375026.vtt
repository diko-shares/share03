00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.680
天哪  我恨这个地方  这是娘们来的餐厅
God, I hate this place. It's a chicks' restaurant.

14
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.910
我们为什么不去多西亚餐厅
Why aren't we at Dorsia?

15
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.470
因为贝特曼不肯给那个领班口交
Because Bateman won't give the matre d' head.

16
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.220
那是里德·罗宾逊吗
Is that Reed Robinson over there?

17
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.040
你嗑嗨了吗  那不是罗宾逊

保罗·艾伦在餐厅的另一边

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.930
-他的女伴是谁  -皮博迪公司的某只狐狸精吧

22
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.840
这里的洗手间可真不适合用来吸粉
They don't have a good bathroom to do coke in.

23
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.120
你确定那是保罗·艾伦吗
Are you sure that's Paul Allen over there?

24
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.610
是的  蠢货  我很确定

25

我见过那个混蛋坐在自己办公室里

30
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.890
一边和首席执行官打电话  一边转犹太烛台玩
talking on the phone to the CEO, spinning a fuckin' menorah.

31
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.500
不是犹太烛台  是犹太陀螺
Not a menorah. You spin a dreidel.

32
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.890
天哪  贝特曼
Oh, my God, Bateman,

33
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.510
需要我给你做点土豆煎饼吗
you want me to fry you up some fuckin' potato pancakes?

34
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.510

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.030
-马铃薯饼  -不用了  你就

别再发表反犹太的言论了

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.960
我忘了  贝特曼在和公民自由协会的姑娘约会
I'd forgotten. Bateman's dating someone from the ACLU.

38
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.660
他就是理性之声  邻家男孩
He's the voice of reason. The boy next door.

39
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.400
说到理性
Speaking of reasonable...

40
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.570
只要五百七

41
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.300

That'll be $25.

47
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.360

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.670
我想捅死你
I want to stab you to death,

49
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.700
再玩玩你的血

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.310

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.780
我深信照料自己
I believe in taking care of myself,

56
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.230
规律饮食
in a balanced diet,

57
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.440
以及严格的锻炼计划
in a rigorous exercise routine.

58
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.920
清晨  如果我的脸有些浮肿
In the morning, if my face is a little puffy,

59
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.010
我会戴上冰眼罩  同时做卷腹
I'll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches.

60
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.060
我现在能做一千个
I can do 1,000 now.

61
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.870
摘下冰袋后
After I remove the ice pack,

62
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.470
我会用深层清洁毛孔的洁面乳
I use a deep pore cleanser lotion.

63
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.420
洗澡的时候  我会用水活洁面啫喱
In the shower, I use a water-activated gel cleanser...

64
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.580
然后用蜂蜜杏仁身体磨砂膏
then a honey-almond body scrub,

65
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.270
面部则用去角质凝胶磨砂膏
and on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub.

66
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.360
接着我会涂上草本薄荷面膜
Then I apply an herb mint facial mask,

67
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.040
敷上十分钟
which I leave on for ten minutes

68
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.410
同时准备剩余的日常步骤
while I prepare the rest of my routine.

69
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.200
我一直使用不含酒精
I always use an aftershave lotion

70
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.150
或是酒精含量很低的须后水
with little or no alcohol,

71
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.310
因为酒精会使面部肌肤干燥
because alcohol dries your face out

72
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.850
让你看起来更老
and makes you look older.

73
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.790
然后是保湿霜
Then moisturizer,

74
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.910
还有抗衰老眼霜

75

最后才是保湿防护乳液

关于帕特里克·贝特曼  存在着一个构想

77
00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.230
某种抽象概念
Some kind of abstraction.

78
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.420
但真实的我并不存在
But there is no real me,

79
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.480
存在的仅仅是一具实体  让人产生错觉
only an entity, something illusory,

80
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.170
虽然我能藏起冰冷的目光
and though I can hide my cold gaze

81
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.340
并且在我们握手时  你能感受到紧握的手
and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours,

82
00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.660
或许你甚至可以感觉到
and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles

83
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.630
我们的生活方式大同小异
are probably comparable,

84
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.690
但我并不在那里
I simply am not there.

85
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.530
早上好  汉密尔顿  皮肤晒得不错

里奇·哈里森要取消
Ricky Harrison has to cancel.

88
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.000
他没说要取消什么  也没说原因
He didn't say what he was canceling or why.

89
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.300
我偶尔会在哈佛俱乐部和里奇打拳击
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club.

90
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.770
还有别人吗
Anyone else?

91
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.160

我该怎么说
And what should I say?

95
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.860
就说不行
Just say no.

96
00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.160
就说不行吗
Just say no?

97
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.400

不是
No...

105
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:21.480
真笨
Silly.

106
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:23.290
算了  我自己订吧
Forget it, I'll make them.

107
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.110
-不  我去  -不用了
- No, I'll do it. - No, no.

108

115
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.300
别这样  你的美貌可不止于此

反正你也不喜欢那份工作
You hate that job anyway.

142
00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.810
我不懂你为什么不辞职
I don't see why you just don't quit.

143

因为我很肯定我们坐不到好位置了
since I'm positive we won't have a decent table,

148
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.790
但我们的位置确实不错
but we do,

149
00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.650

Patrick, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend, Stash.

151
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.380
他们都是艺术家
They're both artists.

152
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.360
-菜单是用盲文写的  -你和大家都见过面了
- The menu is in Braille. - I see you've met everyone.

153
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.070
你真美
You look awesome.

154
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.440
好吧  好吧  行了
Okay, okay, all right.

155
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.560
我很肯定
I'm fairly certain that

156
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.520
蒂莫西·布莱斯和伊芙琳在搞外遇
Timothy Bryce and Evelyn are having an affair.

157
00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:47.830
蒂莫西是我认识的唯一风趣的人
Timothy is the only interesting person I know.

158
00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:49.610
我几乎一点也不关心
I'm almost completely indifferent

159
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:53.000
伊芙琳是否知道我也有外遇
as to whether Evelyn knows I'm having an affair

160
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.500
还是和柯特妮·罗琳森  她最好的朋友
with Courtney Rawlinson, her closest friend.

161
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.970
柯特妮的外貌几乎无可挑剔
Courtney is almost perfect-looking.

162
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.160
她通常会服用一种或若干种精神类药物
She's usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs.

163
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.140
今晚  我想是阿普唑仑
Tonight, I believe it's Xanax.

164
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.470
不过比滥用药物更让人心烦的是
More disturbing than her drug use, though,

165
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.850
她已经和路易斯·卡拉瑟斯订婚了
is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers,

166
00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.560
商界最大的蠢货
the biggest doofus in the business.

167
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.520
告诉我  斯塔什
Tell me, Stash,

168
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:17.440
你觉不觉得苏豪区变得太过商业化了
do you think Soho is becoming too commercial?

169
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.360
没错  我也看到过这个问题
Yes, I read that.

170
00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.490
谁会在乎
Who gives a rat's ass?

171
00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.650
这也会影响到我们
Hey, that affects us.

172
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.880
那斯里兰卡的大屠杀呢  亲爱的
Well, what about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey?

173
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.960
那也会影响我们吗
Doesn't that affect us, too?

174
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.580
你了解斯里兰卡吗
I mean, do you know anything about Sri Lanka?

175
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.550
比如锡克教徒在那里杀了数不清的以色列人
How, like, the Sikhs are killing like tons of Israelis over there?

176
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:33.170
算了  布莱斯
Come on, Bryce.

177
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:34.720
还有很多比斯里兰卡
There are a lot more important problems

178
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.630
更重要的问题要担心呢
than Sri Lanka to worry about.

179
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:37.370
比如
Like what?

180
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.270
我们必须结束种族隔离
Well, we have to end apartheid, for one,

181
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.970
减缓核武器军备竞赛
and slow down the nuclear arms race,

182
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.800
消灭恐怖主义  还有世界饥饿问题
stop terrorism, and world hunger.

183
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.800
我们得为无家可归的人提供食宿
We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless,

184
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.880
反对种族歧视
and oppose racial discrimination

185
00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.810
促进民权
and promote civil rights,

186
00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:56.800
还要促进女性平权
while also promoting equal rights for women.

187
00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:03.110
我们要鼓励回归传统的道德价值观
We have to encourage a return to traditional moral values.

188
00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:04.680
最重要的是
Most importantly,

189
00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.950
我们要提倡普遍的社会关怀
we have to promote general social concern

190
00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:11.550
减少年轻人的物质主义
and less materialism in young people.

191
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.420
帕特里克
Patrick...

192
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.330
你想得真周到
how thoughtful of you.

193
00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:54.660
你好
Hello.

194

你好
Hello.

195
00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.800
漂百  你是想说"漂白"吗
Bleach-ee? Are you trying to say "Bleaching"?

196
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.140
漂百  天哪  我就说两件事
Bleach-ee. Oh, my God. Two things.

197
00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.870
首先  你不能漂白切瑞蒂的衣服  这没得说
One, you can't bleach a Cerruti. Out of the question.

198
00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:28.780
衣服更干净  送您好心情

199
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.440
其次  我只能从圣达菲买到这些床单
Two, I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe.

200
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.300
这些床单很贵  我需要你们把它们洗干净
These are very expensive sheets and I really need them clean.

201
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.400
如果你再不闭嘴
If you don't shut your fucking mouth,

202
00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.130
我就杀了你
I will kill you.

203
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:35.050
20分钟后  我要和罗纳德·哈里森

我听不懂你说的话
Listen, I cannot understand you!

207
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.160
太扯了  你这个蠢货
This is crazy. You're a fool.

208
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.090
我受不了了  你个傻逼
I can't cope with this. Stupid bitch-ee!

209
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.590
懂了吗
Understand?

210
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:47.520
帕特里克

211
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:50.480
你好  帕特里克  我就觉得是你
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.

212
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.020
你好  女士
Hello, missus.

213
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.380
大老远跑过来是不是有点莫名其妙
Isn't it ridiculous coming all the way up here?

214
00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:55.740
但他们的确是最好的
But they really are the best.

215
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.780
那他们为什么不能洗掉这些污渍
Then why can't they get these stains out?

216
00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.960
你能和他们谈谈吗
I mean, can you talk to these people or something?

217
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.740
我真的无法跟他们交流
I'm not getting anywhere.

218
00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.180
那是什么污渍
What are those?

219
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.280
蔓越莓汁  蔓越莓苹果汁
Well, it's cranberry juice. Cranapple.

220
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.350
真的吗
Really?

221
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:09.210
如果你能和他们谈谈

我真的很感激  我真的要迟到了

休贝餐厅  那家搬到上城区了  是吗
Hubert's? That moved uptown, right?

225
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:16.870
天哪  听着  我得走了

232
00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:29.720

你今晚还能干点什么
What could you possibly be up to tonight?

238
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.270
别说了  我...
Stop it. I'm...

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.720
吃了很多锂剂吗
On a lot of lithium?

258
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.980

天哪  帕特里克  闭嘴吧

柯特妮  你该多吃点锂剂

299
00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.410
这也挺符合逻辑的  因为马库斯也在这里工作
It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&P,

300
00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:46.810
事实上  我们俩的工作内容相同
and in fact, does the same exact thing I do.

301
00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.340
他也偏爱华伦天奴的西装
He also has a penchant for Valentino suits

302
00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.090
和奥利弗·皮帕斯的眼镜

304
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:52.880
我们俩甚至连理发师都是同一个人
Marcus and I even go to the same barber,

305
00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.950
不过我的发型要稍微好点
although I have a slightly better haircut.

306
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.080
所以那个要赎金的客户怎么样了  马库斯
So how's the ransom account going, Marcus?

307
00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.860
-挺好的  -是吗

308
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.700
真有意思  只是挺好
That's interesting. It's not,

309
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:02.200
-却没有特别棒  -你也知道的
- it's not great. - Well, you know.

310
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.290
塞西莉亚怎么样  她是个不错的女孩
So how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.

311
00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.360
是啊  我很幸运

439
00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.850
毕竟  来这家门可罗雀的餐厅的人
which is, after all, the only excuse one could have for being

也只能是

449
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.110
这儿真热闹  哈博斯特拉姆
This is a real beehive of activity, Halberstram.

450
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:25.360
这个地方很火  特别火
This place is hot. Very hot.

451
00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.220
听我说  这里的黑豆汤
Listen, the mud soup

452
00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.500
和炭烧芝麻菜非常不错
and charcoal arugula are outrageous here.

453
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.060
好吧  你迟到了
Yeah, well, you're late.

454
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:33.980
我是单亲家庭的孩子  饶了我吧
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break.

455
00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.830
我发现他们删掉了猪排配青柠果冻
I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime Jell-O.

456
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:39.640
我们应该去多西亚
We should've gone to Dorsia.

457
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:41.570
我可以给咱俩订到座位
I could have gotten us a table.

458
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:43.150
没有人再去那里了
Nobody goes there anymore.

459
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.230
那个是伊凡娜·特朗普吗
Is that Ivana Trump?

460
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.550
天哪  帕特里克
Jeez, Patrick--

461
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:50.570
我是说  马库斯
I mean, Marcus...

462
00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:52.050
你在想什么啊
What are you thinking?

463
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:54.930
伊凡娜怎么会在特克萨卡纳餐厅呢
Why would lvana be at Texarkana?

464
00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.840
话说...
So...

465
00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.910
之前负责费舍的不是罗斯柴尔德吗
Wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account?

466
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:01.340
怎么会到你手上
How'd you get it?

467
00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.680
我可以告诉你事情原委  哈博斯特拉姆
Well, I could tell you that, Halberstram,

468
00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.210
但那样的话我就得杀了你
but then I'd have to kill you.

469
00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:15.850
我喜欢解剖女孩
I like to dissect girls.

470
00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:17.710
你知道我完全疯了吗
Did you know I'm utterly insane?

471
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:22.770
肤色晒得不错  马库斯  非常棒
Great tan, Marcus. I mean, really impressive.

472
00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:24.720
-你在哪里晒的  -沙龙
- Where do you tan? - Salon.

473
00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.580
我家里有一台日晒床  你应该试试
I've got a tanning bed at home. You should look into it.

474
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:29.240
那个...
And...

475
00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.620
塞西莉亚  她怎么样
Cecilia... how is she?

476
00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:32.950
她今晚去哪了
Where is she tonight?

477
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:34.310
塞西莉亚去...
Cecilia is...

478
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:35.430
她这人你也知道
Well, you know Cecilia.

479
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:37.530
我想她今天的晚餐是和...
I think she's having dinner with...

480
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:38.960
伊芙琳·威廉姆斯一起吃的
Evelyn Williams.

481
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.320
伊芙琳
Evelyn.

482
00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:41.850
她屁股不错
Great ass.

483
00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:43.610
和那个废物帕特里克·贝特曼在一起
Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman.

484
00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:45.120
他真是个呆子
What a dork.

485
00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:48.360
要再来杯马提尼吗  保罗
Another martini, Paul?

486
00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:56.210
休易·路易斯和新闻乐队[美国摇滚乐队]
《瞩目》

487
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:56.190
你喜欢休易·路易斯和新闻乐队吗
You like Huey Lewis and the News?

488
00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:58.790
他们还行吧
They're okay.

489
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:04.350
他们的早期作品对我来说有点太新浪潮了
Their early work was a little too new wave for my taste.

490
00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:07.180
但当83年《运动》问世时
But when Sports came out in '83,

491
00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.840
我觉得他们才真正找到自己的特色  崭露头角
I think they really came into their own,

492
00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.730
商业上和艺术上都是
commercially and artistically.

493
00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:16.170
整张专辑听起来清脆悦耳
The whole album has a clear, crisp sound,

494
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.970
精湛的专业水平带来的熠熠光辉
and a new sheen of consummate professionalism

495
00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.950
让他们的歌曲有了质的飞跃
that really gives the songs a big boost.

496
00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.490
纽约药房
帕特里克·贝特曼
服药请遵医嘱

497
00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.880
他一直被人拿来和埃尔维斯·科斯特洛比较
He's been compared to Elvis Costello,

498
00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.880
英国流行摇滚歌手

499
00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.060
但我觉得休易具有更加激烈的
but I think Huey has a far more bitter,

500
00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.900
愤世嫉俗的幽默感
cynical sense of humor.

501
00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.880
-哈博斯特拉姆  -怎么了  艾伦
- Hey, Halberstram. - Yes, Allen?

502
00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.630
为什么这里到处都是报纸的时尚版
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place?

503
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:45.810
你是...  你是养了狗吗
Do you-- Do you have a dog?

504
00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.070
小松狮犬之类的吗
A little chow or something?

505
00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:49.660
不  艾伦
No, Allen.

506
00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:51.410
那是雨衣吗
Is that a raincoat?

507
00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:52.920
是的
Yes, it is.

508
00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:56.740
87年  休易发行了这张专辑
In '87, Huey released this,

509
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:58.770
《瞩目》  他们最成功的一张专辑
Fore!, their most accomplished album.

510
00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:00.760
我觉得他们的《循规蹈矩也很酷》
I think their undisputed masterpiece is

511
00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:02.160
是无可辩驳的杰作
"Hip To Be Square".

512
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.430
这首歌特别琅琅上口
The song's so catchy.

513
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:05.650
大多数人可能都不会去听歌词
Most people probably don't listen to the lyrics.

514
00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:06.640
但是他们应该听一听
But they should,

515
00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.190
因为这首歌不只唱出了循规蹈矩的愉悦
because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity

516
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:10.580
和随大流的重要性
and the importance of trends.

517
00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:14.180
乐队自身也借这首歌抒发了自我
It's also a personal statement about the band itself.

518
00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.680
保罗
Hey, Paul!

519
00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:23.420
现在再去多西亚订座啊
Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now,

520
00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.520
你这个愚蠢的混蛋
you fucking stupid bastard!

521
00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.460
你这个该死的混蛋
You fucking bastard!

522
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.430
他当时完全赤裸  站在桌子上
He was completely naked and he was standing on the table,

523
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:35.480
身无片缕...
with no clothes on--

524
00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:38.850
帕特里克  帕特里克
Patrick? Patrick!

525
00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:40.690
是你吗
Is that you?

526
00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:44.010
不  路易斯  不是我  你搞错了
No, Luis, it's not me. You're mistaken.

527
00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:46.770
这是我非常好的朋友  帕特里克·贝特曼
This is my very good friend, Patrick Bateman.

528
00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:48.130
你要去哪儿
Where are you going?

529
00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:49.270
我们要去内尔餐厅
We're going to Nell's.

530
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:51.090
格温多琳的父亲请客
Gwendolyn's father is buying it.

531
00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.250
那个旅行袋你在哪买的
Where did you get that overnight bag?

532
00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:00.900
让·保罗·高缇耶
Jean Paul Gaultier.

533
00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:00.900
法国设计师品牌

534
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:14.430
当我到达保罗·艾伦的住处时
When I get to Paul Allen's place,

535
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:16.440
我用从他口袋里拿的钥匙开了门
I use the keys I took from his pocket

536
00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:18.400
钥匙是在处理尸体前拿的
before disposing of the body.

537
00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:21.540
我一度感到十分恐慌
There is a moment of sheer panic

538
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:25.290
当我意识到他的公寓能俯瞰中央公园
when I realize that Paul's apartment overlooks the park

539
00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.640
并且显然比我的公寓更贵时
and it's obviously more expensive than mine.

540
00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:35.380
我让自己冷静下来  走进了卧室
I calm myself and move into the bedroom,

541
00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:38.130
我在那里找到了他的行李箱  开始收拾
where I find his suitcase and start to pack.

542
00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:41.220
保罗是时候出去转一转了
It's time for Paul to take a little trip.

543
00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.770
要送这个混蛋去哪呢
Where to send the bastard?

544
00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.750
达拉斯
Dallas?

545
00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:50.770
巴黎  新加坡

546
00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.500
伦敦  我要送这混蛋去伦敦
London. I'll send the ass to London.

547

粗条纹衬衫要配纯色
A bold-striped shirt calls for solid-colored

566
00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.320
或者暗纹的西装和领带

567
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:20.830
是的  一定要给造型师15%的小费

568

585

所以  有什么事...

所以没什么特别正式的
So it's nothing that official.

592
00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.590
我只要问几个简单的问题
I just have some basic questions

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:30.640
-真的不用  没关系  -不用客气

601
00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:39.080
保罗·艾伦的失踪

602
00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:39.950

604
00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:47.920
我还没有听说任何有关失踪的事
I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything,

605
00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:50.050
至少在杂志八卦版上没有
not on Page Six, at least.

606
00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:52.220
我想他的家人希望此事保密
I think his family wants this kept quiet.

607
00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.680
可以理解  要青柠吗

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.510
不用  真的没关系
No, no, really, I'm okay.

609
00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:56.930
你确定吗  我完全可以给你来片青柠
You sure? I can always get you a lime.

610
00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:58.810
我只想初步问几个问题

611
00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:00.680
出于我的调查需要  好吗

Shoot.

关于保罗·艾伦  你有什么能告诉我的
What can you tell me about Paul Allen?

621
00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:19.360
我也不知道
I'm at a loss.

622
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:21.580
他是那种耶鲁风的
He was part of that whole Yale thing.

623
00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:24.070
-"耶鲁风"  -是的  耶鲁风
- "Yale thing"? - Yeah, Yale thing.

624
00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:25.580
你说的"耶鲁风"是什么意思
What do you mean, "Yale thing"?

625
00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:29.460
比如  我觉得他大概是个没出柜的同性恋

627

除了你刚刚给我的那些信息以外

希望我现在不是在被盘问

你感觉像吗
Do you feel like that?

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:43.090
不  其实不太像
No, not really.

633
00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:46.350

-活动  -是的  常活动的地方

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.150
他在哪上的学
And where did he go to school?

643
00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:06.420
这个你不知道吗
Don't you know this?

644
00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.450
我只想知道你是否知道
I just wanted to know if you know.

你有发现任何目击证人或指纹吗

在他的答录机上有一条留言

说他去伦敦了

653
00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:31.610

Maybe he did, huh?

654
00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:32.940
他的女朋友不这么认为
His girlfriend doesn't think so.

659
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:42.200
说他在那里的一家餐厅里见过他
said he saw him at a restaurant there.

660
00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.790
但我调查后发现  实际上
But I checked it out, and what happened is

661
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:45.430
他误把一个叫赫伯特·安斯沃思的人
he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth

662
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:46.570

凶案组还没有人
I mean, no one's dealing with

668
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:56.340
来介入调查吧
the homicide squad yet or anything, right?

还没有  正如我之前所说  我们还不确定

基本上没有任何人目击或听见什么

672
00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:04.130

It's just strange.

无影无踪

一个人就这样凭空消失了

677

地球张开大口  把他们吞噬了
The Earth just opens up and swallows them.

678
00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:19.860
可怕
Eerie.

679

真可怕
Really eerie.

680
00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:29.670
不好意思  我得走了
Listen, you'll have to excuse me.

那地方在上城区  是不是离这里有点远
Isn't that a little far uptown?

685
00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:39.670
难道你不会迟到吗
I mean, aren't you going to be late?

686

开玩笑
I'm joking.

702

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:53.560
你们喜欢听菲尔·柯林斯吗
Do you like Phil Collins?

754
00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:53.560
英国歌手  在创世纪乐队中担任主唱兼鼓手

755
00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.900
我是创世纪乐队的超级粉丝
I've been a big Genesis fan

756
00:41:56.330 --> 00:42:00.360
从他们1980年发行了《杜克》那张专辑以来就是了
ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke.

757
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.200
在那之前
Before that,

758
00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:05.700
他们的作品我一点都听不懂
I really didn't understand any of their work.

759
00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:08.910
艺术性太强  让人听不懂
It was too artsy, too intellectual.

760
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:10.830
正是《杜克》这张专辑
It was on Duke where

761
00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.790
才让菲尔·柯林斯在乐队中的地位更加明确
Phil Collins' presence became more apparent.

762
00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:18.880
我认为《无形的触碰》这张专辑
I think Invisible Touch

763
00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.050
是乐队无可争议的杰作
is the group's undisputed masterpiece.

764
00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.600
那是一次关于无形的
It's an epic meditation

765
00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:28.560
史诗般的冥想
on intangibility.

766
00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:34.230
与此同时  它深化并丰富了
At the same time, it deepens and enriches

767
00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:36.980
前三张专辑的意蕴
the meaning of the preceding three albums.

768
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:39.110
克里斯蒂
Christie,

769
00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:41.150
脱掉浴袍
take off the robe.

770
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:45.040
你听那精彩的合奏
Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing

771
00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.450
班克斯的键盘  柯林斯的鼓  和路德佛的吉他
of Banks, Collins, and Rutherford.

772
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:52.000
你能听到每种乐器的细微差别
You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument.

773
00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:55.040
萨布丽娜  把裙子脱了
Sabrina, remove your dress.

774
00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:57.710
在写词的技艺
In terms of lyrical craftsmanship,

775
00:42:57.930 --> 00:42:59.590
和纯粹的歌曲创作方面
sheer songwriting,

776
00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.260
这张专辑达到了专业水准的新巅峰
this album hits a new peak of professionalism.

777
00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:05.340
萨布丽娜  不如你稍微跳跳舞吧
Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?

778
00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.720
比如《混沌之地》这首歌的歌词
Take the lyrics to "Land Of Confusion."

779
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:12.360
菲尔·柯林斯通过这首歌
In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems

780
00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.650
直击滥用政治权力的问题
of abusive political authority.

781
00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:21.570
而《深陷其中》是80年代最感人的流行歌
"In Too Deep" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s,

782
00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:24.700
讲的是一夫一妻制和承诺
about monogamy and commitment.

783
00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:27.750
这首歌极其振奋人心
The song is extremely uplifting.

784
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:31.790
歌词的积极向上和确定感
Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative

785
00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:35.250
可以与我在摇滚中听到的元素相媲美
as anything I've heard in rock.

786
00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:40.250
克里斯蒂
Christie,

787
00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:43.550
跪下让萨布丽娜能看到你的后庭
get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole.

788
00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.970
菲尔·柯林斯的单飞生涯
Phil Collins' solo career

789
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:49.220
似乎更商业化
seems to be more commercial,

790
00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.360
从某种狭隘的角度来说
and therefore more satisfying

791
00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.060
也因此更令人满意了
in a narrower way.

792
00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:55.780
尤其是像《今夜无处不在》
Especially songs like "ln The Air Tonight"

793
00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:58.110
和《希望渺茫》这两首歌
and "Against All Odds."

794
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:02.610
萨布丽娜  别光盯着看  用嘴
Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it.

795
00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.620
但我还是认为
But I also think

796
00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:09.270
菲尔·柯林斯在乐队的表现最好 
Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group

797
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:11.040
而不是单飞艺术家
than as a solo artist.

798
00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:14.160
我要强调一下"艺术家"这个词
And I stress the word "artist."

799
00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:19.960
这首歌是《萨苏迪欧》
This is "Sussudio."

800
00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:21.630
很棒很棒的一首歌
A great, great song.

801
00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:23.920
个人最爱
A personal favorite.

802
00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:36.100
看着镜头
Look at the camera.

803
00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:17.390
克里斯蒂  看镜头
Christie, look at the camera.

804
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:34.870
别碰手表
Don't touch the watch.

805
00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:58.560
我们能走了吗
Can we go now?

806
00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.020
还没完事呢
We're not through yet.

807
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.970
如果她们性格很好但长得不好看
If they have a good personality and they're not great-looking,

808
00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:22.630
那谁他妈还在乎
then who fuckin' cares?

809
00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:24.510
就假设一下  好吗
Just say, hypothetically, okay,

810
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:26.380
如果她们性格很好呢
what if they have a good personality?

811
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:30.310
我知道  我知道...
I know, I know...

812
00:46:30.310 --> 00:46:32.800
不存在性格好的女孩子
There are no girls with good personalities.

813
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:36.180
好性格就是小妞身材紧实
A good personality consists of a chick with a little hard body

814
00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:37.940
能满足你所有的性需求
who'll satisfy all sexual demands

815
00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:39.860
同时还不能太浪
without being too slutty about things,

816
00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:41.990
而且还能管住嘴巴不八卦
and will essentially keep her dumb fucking mouth shut.

817
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:43.700
性格好的女孩子
The only girls with good personalities

818
00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.360
要么聪明  要么有趣
who are smart, or maybe funny,

819
00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.280
要么智商不低  要么才华横溢
or halfway intelligent or talented,

820
00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.400
鬼才知道我讲的是什么样的女孩
though God knows what the fuck that means,

821
00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:51.080
-那一定都是丑八怪  -绝对
- are ugly chicks. - Absolutely.

822
00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.700
这正是因为她们不得不弥补
And this is because they have to make up

823
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:54.460
自己毫无吸引力的事实
for how fucking unattractive they are.

824
00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:56.120
你们知道关于女人  艾德·盖恩是怎么说吗
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?

825
00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:57.790
哪个艾德·盖恩  运河酒吧的领班吗
Ed Gein? Matre d' at Canal Bar?

826
00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:00.800
不  是50年代威斯康辛州的连环杀手
No. Serial killer. Wisconsin in the '50s.

827
00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.880
-艾德怎么说  -他说
- And what did Ed say? - He said,

828
00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.550
"当我看到漂亮姑娘走在街上
"When I see a pretty girl walking down the street,

829
00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:04.790
我有两个念头
I think two things.

830
00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:07.930
一个我想要跟她约会  聊天
One part of me wants to take her out and talk to her,

831
00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:10.260
用心待她  全心全意"
be real nice and sweet and treat her right."

832
00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.760
另一个他怎么想
And what did the other part of him think?

833
00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:14.890
"把棍子插进她的脑袋会是什么景象"
"What her head would look like on a stick."

834
00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:20.930
伙计们
Hi, guys.

835
00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:23.600
我需要你们的意见
I want to get your opinion on something.

836
00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:25.770
是我的名片
It's my business card.

837
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:29.020
我也决定重新定制一款
I decided to get a new one, too.

838
00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:33.570
这个...
That's...

839
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:35.240
很不错  路易斯
Very nice, Luis.

840
00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:38.780
多谢夸奖
Thank you.

841
00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:42.080
路易斯·卡拉瑟斯
副总裁

842
00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:54.470
对了  晚饭怎么办
Listen, what about dinner?

843
00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:56.560
你能说的就这些吗  范帕顿
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten?

844
00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.090
"见鬼的晚饭怎么办"
"What about fucking dinner?"

845
00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:59.520
别丧气  贝特曼
Cheer up there, Bateman.

846
00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:01.270
怎么了  今早忘记做按摩了吗
What's the matter, no shiatsu this mornin'?

847
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:03.110
再碰我一下  我要你好看
Touch me again like that, and you'll draw back a stump.

848
00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:05.560
-冷静  兄弟  -失陪
- Hold on there, little buddy. - Excuse me.

849
00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:45.560
天哪  帕特里克
God. Patrick.

850
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:47.140
为什么要在这里
Why here?

851
00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.900
我见过你看我的眼神
I've seen you looking at me.

852
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:51.310
我注意到过...
I've noticed...

853
00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:52.610
你那...
your...

854
00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:54.360
惹火的身材
hot body.

855
00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:57.150
别害羞
Don't be shy.

856
00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:00.250
你无法想象我为这一刻等了多久
You can't imagine how long I've wanted this,

857
00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:02.710
从那次在亚利桑那206餐厅的圣诞派对开始
ever since that Christmas party at Arizona 206.

858
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:03.330
你知道的
You know the one.

859
00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:06.620
当时你打着阿玛尼红色旋涡纹领带
You were wearing that red-striped paisley Armani tie.

860
00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:10.960
我想要你
I want you.

861
00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:13.170
我也想要你
I want you, too.

862
00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:15.920
-帕特里克  -什么事
- Patrick! - What is it?

863
00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:18.840
你去哪
Where are you going?

864
00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.640
我要去还录像带
I've gotta return some videotapes.

865
00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:30.020
帕特里克
Patrick!

866
00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:57.600
周一  20号
Okay, Monday? The 20th.

867
00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.090
周一  那...
Monday? That's...

868
00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:01.060
-没有保罗·艾伦的预约  -预约...没有
- Any Paul Allen?  -Reservation... no.

869
00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:03.010
-没有预约  但  -坎鲍尔
- No reservation, but... - Kimball.

870
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:05.270
我一直想找你聊聊  来我办公室
I've been wanting to talk with you. Come into my office.

871
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:07.520
琴  今天的外套很好看  松田家的吗
Jean, great jacket. Matsuda?

872
00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:11.060
你记得保罗失踪那晚你在哪吗
Do you remember where you were the night of Paul's disappearance?

873
00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.610
12月20号
Which was on the 20th of December?

874
00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:15.110
天哪
God.

875
00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:18.400
我大概去还录像带了吧
I guess I was probably returning videotapes.

876
00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.210
我在跟一个叫维罗妮卡的女孩约会
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.

877
00:50:24.210 --> 00:50:25.530
我得到的消息可并非如此
That's not what I've got.

878
00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:26.630
什么
What?

879
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:29.250
我收到的消息不是这么说的
That's not the information I've received.

880
00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.120
我...等等
Well, I-- Wait.

881
00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:32.800
你收到了什么消息
What information have you received?

882
00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:33.880
我看看
Let me see.

883
00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:39.840
-你当时和...  -我可能记错了
- You were with... - Well, I could be wrong.

884
00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:42.980
你最后一次跟保罗·艾伦在一起是什么时候
When was the last time you were with Paul Allen?

885
00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:46.050
我们一起去看了新音乐剧
We'd gone to a new musical called

886
00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:49.150
《啊! 非洲!  勇敢的非洲》
Oh, Africa, Brave Africa.

887
00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:50.480
很搞笑的剧
It was a laugh riot.

888
00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:51.810
大概就这样
That was about it.

889
00:50:52.110 --> 00:50:53.820
我们应该是在欧瑟餐厅吃了晚饭
I think we had dinner at Orso's.

890
00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:55.770
不对  是湃朵餐厅  不  是欧瑟
No, Petal... No, Orso's.

891
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:58.990
希望这些能帮到你  今天事情太多  有点分心
I hope I've been informative. Long day. Bit scattered.

892
00:50:58.990 --> 00:51:00.610
我现在也有点筋疲力尽
I'm a little spent now, too.

893
00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.150
但是...
But...

894
00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:04.490
要不一周后我们约个午饭
how about lunch in a week or so?

895
00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:06.670
等我理清所有的信息
When I've sorted out all this information.

896
00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:07.960
好  棒极了  我很乐意
Great. Yes, I'd like that.

897
00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:11.540
如果你能确定保罗·艾伦失踪那晚
And if you could try and pin down where you were

898
00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:13.880
你人在哪里的话
the night of Paul Allen's disappearance,

899
00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:15.430
我的工作就好做多了
it would make my job a lot easier.

900
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:17.670
当然  这件事上我支持你
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.

901
00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:23.840
休易·路易斯和新闻乐队
Huey Lewis And The News.

902
00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:27.390
这张专辑挺不错
Great stuff.

903

没有
Never.

905
00:51:32.530 --> 00:51:34.610
我不太喜欢歌手
I mean, I don't really like singers.

906
00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:36.440
你不是乐迷  是吧
Not a big music fan, huh?

907
00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:37.940
不  我喜欢音乐
No, I like music.

908
00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:39.610
只是他们...
Just, they're...

909
00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:43.070
休易在我听来  曲风太像黑人了
Huey's too black-sounding for me.

910
00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:44.700
萝卜青菜  各有所爱
To each his own.

911
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:47.990
那么...
So...

912
00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:49.530

Maybe.

916
00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:36.460

在河畔咖啡厅吃晚餐

918
00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:40.800
或许之后会去酒吧
Au Bar afterwards, maybe.

919
00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:41.790
真好
That's nice.

920
00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:45.720
我不知道你还抽烟
I never knew you smoked.

921
00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.550
你从未注意过
You never noticed.

922

听着
Listen,

923
00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:54.970

你看着
You look

926
00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:05.740
美极了
marvelous.

927
00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:08.240
没什么好说的
There's nothin' to say.

928
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:10.370
你会嫁给路易斯
You're gonna marry Luis.

929
00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:12.240
可不就是很特别吗
Isn't that special.

930
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:15.830
帕特里克
Patrick...

931
00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:22.210
怎么了  柯特妮
Yes, Courtney?

932
00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:27.510
我要是在复活节前没见到你
If I don't see you before Easter,

933
00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:29.930
祝你复活节快乐  好吗

934
00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:36.220
你也是

935
00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:44.730
帕特里克
Patrick?

936
00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:46.730
怎么了
Yeah?

937
00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:49.820
没事
Nothing.

938
00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:20.440
目前有理论认为
There's this theory now,

939
00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:21.990
听着  目前有理论认为
listen to it, there's this theory now

940
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:23.200
你如果能通过做爱
that if you can catch the AIDS virus

941
00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:26.400
感染上艾滋病  那任何病毒你都能感染
through having sex with someone, then you can catch anything.

942
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:29.290
阿兹海默症  肌肉萎缩症
Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy,

943
00:54:29.290 --> 00:54:32.910
血友病  白血病  糖尿病  阅读障碍
hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia.

944
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:35.410
我不确定  但我不觉得阅读障碍算是病毒
I'm not sure, but I don't think dyslexia's a virus.

945
00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:38.200
谁知道呢  他们都不知道
Who knows? They don't know that.

946
00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:39.370
证明看看
Prove it.

947
00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:53.430
-我的天  -怎么了
- Oh, God! - What?

948
00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:55.690
这玩意毒品含量少得可怜
There's a fucking milligram of sweetener.

949
00:54:55.690 --> 00:54:57.100
我想吸到嗨  贝特曼
I wanna get high off this, Bateman,

950
00:54:57.110 --> 00:54:59.060
而不是拿来撒在麦片上
not sprinkle it on my fucking oatmeal.

951
00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:00.270
纯度确实低  不过我觉得
It's definitely weak, but I have a feeling

952
00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:01.900
只要多吸点  能嗨起来的
if we do enough of it, we'll be okay.

953
00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:04.690
你们能小声点吗  我在吸毒呢
Can you keep it down? I'm trying to do drugs.

954
00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:06.450
去你的
Fuck you!

955
00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:08.320
冷静点  快吸吧
Calm down. Do it anyway.

956
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:09.940
没错
That's right.

957
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:12.370
只要隔间的基佬觉得没关系就行了
That is, if the fag in the next stall thinks it's okay!

958
00:55:12.370 --> 00:55:14.200
-去你的  -去你的
- Fuck you! - Hey. Fuck you!

959
00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:18.580
抱歉  兄弟  头脑一热
Sorry, dude. Steroids.

960
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:20.290
好了  吸吧
Okay, let's do it.

961
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:43.640
克雷格去哪里了
Where did Craig go?

962
00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:45.940
戈尔巴乔夫在楼下
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs.

963
00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:47.490
麦克德莫特去签署
McDermott went to sign a peace treaty

964
00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:48.990
美国和俄罗斯之间的和平条约
between the United States and Russia.

965
00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:50.900
他推动了公开性改革
He's the one behind glasnost, you know.

966
00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:50.900
"公开性"指戈尔巴乔夫在苏联倡导的
允许公开讨论国家政治的政策

967
00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:54.110
他说他在一家并购公司
He said he was in mergers and acquisitions.

968
00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:56.320
你还没迷糊  是吧
You're not confused, are you?

969
00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:58.000
没有
No, not really.

970
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.120
戈尔巴乔夫不在楼下
Gorbachev is not downstairs.

971
00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:02.750
凯伦说得对  戈尔巴乔夫不在楼下
Karen's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs.

972
00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:03.750

He's at Tunnel.

973
00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:05.040
问我一个问题
Ask me a question.

974
00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:08.460
你是做什么的
So, what do you do?

975
00:56:08.890 --> 00:56:10.090
我主要做
I'm into

976
00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.640
杀人灭口
murders and executions, mostly.

977
00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:13.760
你喜欢吗
Do you like it?

978
00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:14.840
看情况
Well, it depends.

979
00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:16.430
怎么了
Why?

980
00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:20.300
我认识的大部分在并购公司的家伙
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions

981
00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:22.220
并不喜欢这份工作
really don't like it.

982
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:24.980
那么...
So...

983
00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:27.600
你在哪里健身
where do you work out?

984
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:32.650
你觉得我很蠢  对吧
You think I'm dumb, don't you?

985
00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:33.700
什么
What?

986
00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:36.290
你觉得我很蠢  你觉得所有模特都蠢
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.

987
00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:37.280
不
No.

988
00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.040
我真没这么想
I really don't.

989
00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:41.030
没关系  我不介意
That's okay. I don't mind.

990
00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:44.160
你挺可爱的
There's something sweet about you.

991
00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:12.730
在玩填字游戏吗
Doin' the crossword?

992
00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:17.330
骨和肉

993
00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:18.740
需要帮忙吗
You need any help?

994
00:57:29.970 --> 00:57:30.960
琴
Jean?

995
00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:32.750
怎么了  帕特里克
Yes, Patrick?

996
00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:35.050
你愿意陪我吃晚餐吗
Would you like to accompany me to dinner?

997
00:57:35.810 --> 00:57:36.800
前提是
That is,

998
00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.130
如果你有空的话
if you're not doing anything.

999
00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:41.930
不  我没有别的安排
No. No, I don't have any plans.

1000
00:57:43.810 --> 00:57:44.850
那么...
Well...

1001
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:49.730
真巧啊
isn't this a coincidence.

1002
00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:51.150
我们该去哪吃饭呢
Listen, where should we go?

1003
00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:52.360
你说了算
Anywhere you want.

1004
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:54.370
别管我的想法
Let's not think about what I want.

1005
00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:55.940
不如说说你想去哪
How about anywhere you want?

1006
00:57:57.870 --> 00:58:00.280
我不知道  帕特里克  我做不了主
I don't know, Patrick. I can't make this decision.

1007
00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:01.490
说吧
Come on.

1008
00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:04.130
你想去哪里
Where do you want to go?

1009
00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:05.330
任何地方都行
Anywhere you want.

1010
00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:07.910
尽管说  我都能办到
Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.

1011
00:58:09.090 --> 00:58:10.330
那就去...
What about...

琴想去多西亚餐厅
Dorsia is where Jean wants to go.

1015
00:58:33.110 --> 00:58:33.740
我不知道
I don't know.

1016
00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:35.820
不  都听你的
No, we'll go wherever you want to go.

1017

1021
00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:52.420

1022
00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:54.590
不  我是说我们订满了
No, I said we are totally booked.

1023
00:58:54.590 --> 00:58:56.220
晚上九点两个座位  完美

你没有留名字
You didn't give a name.

1029
00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:11.020
他们认识我
They know me.

1030
00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:14.280
你不如来我家找我吧
Why don't you meet me at my place?

1031

晚上七点  先喝一杯
At 7:00. For drinks.

1032
00:59:18.450 --> 00:59:19.400
琴
And, Jean?

1033
00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:22.650
我们出门前得换身衣服
We'll want to change before we go out.

1034
00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:33.040
帕特里克  太漂亮了

视野真好
What a wonderful view.

1036
00:59:35.590 --> 00:59:36.580
琴
Jean.

1037
00:59:37.890 --> 00:59:38.960
吃冰沙吗

1038
00:59:41.350 --> 00:59:43.090
谢谢  帕特里克  我想吃
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.

1039
00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:50.600
你要吃一口吗
Do you want a bite?

1040
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:53.320
我在节食  但还是谢谢你
I'm on a diet. But thank you.

1041
00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:54.850
你不需要减肥
You don't need to lose any weight.

1042
00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:56.150
你在开玩笑  对吗
You're kidding, right?

1043
00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:59.570
你看起来很棒  非常健康
You look great. Very fit.

1044
01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:03.700
再瘦点  再帅点  总归是好的
You can always be thinner, look better.

1045
01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.780
或许我们不该去吃晚餐
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner.

1046
01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:08.200
我不想动摇你的意志力
I don't want to ruin your willpower.

1047
01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:09.330
不  没关系
No, it's all right.

1048
01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:13.160
反正我意志力也不强
I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.

1049
01:00:16.930 --> 01:00:18.040
那么...
So, listen...

1050
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:21.630
你想要什么样的生活
What do you really want to do with your life?

1051
01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:24.300
简略总结就好  还有
Just briefly. Summarize. And

1052
01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:27.260
别告诉我你想被孩子们围着  好吗
don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?

1053
01:00:27.310 --> 01:00:28.260
这个嘛
Well,

1054
01:00:28.650 --> 01:00:30.230
我想去旅行
I'd like to travel and

1055
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:32.350
或许还想回学校读书  但是
maybe go back to school, but

1056
01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:34.020
我也不太清楚
I don't really know.

1057
01:00:34.690 --> 01:00:37.560
我现在所处的人生阶段  看起来
I'm at a point in my life where there seems to be

1058
01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.560
有很多种可能性
so many possibilities.

1059
01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:42.480
但我不知道  心里没底
But I don't know. I'm just so unsure.

1060
01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.530
你有男朋友吗
Do you have a boyfriend?

1061
01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.450
没有
No, not really.

1062
01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:52.410
有意思
Interesting.

1063
01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:54.250
你在跟谁交往吗
Are you seeing anyone?

1064
01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:56.620
我是说认真的关系
I mean, seriously?

1065
01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:58.330
可能吧
Maybe.

1066
01:00:58.930 --> 01:01:00.000
我不知道
I don't know.

1067
01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:02.290
算不上
Not really.

1068
01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:06.260
琴
Jean?

1069
01:01:07.310 --> 01:01:09.800
你感到满足吗
Do you feel fulfilled?

1070
01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:12.510
我是说在生活上
I mean, in your life?

1071
01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:13.850
应该吧
I guess I do.

1072
01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:16.230
长时间以来  我太专注工作了
For a long time, I was too focused on my work.

1073
01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:19.950
但现在  我真的开始思考转变
But now I've really begun to think about changing myself.

1074
01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:23.770
自我发展和成长
You know, developing and growing.

1075
01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:24.860
成长
Growing.

1076
01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.490
很高兴听到你这么说
I'm glad you said that.

1077
01:01:30.790 --> 01:01:32.160
你知道
Did you know that

1078
01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:34.210
泰德·邦迪的第一只狗是牧羊犬
Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie,

1079
01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:34.210
美国七十年代连环杀手

1080

1081
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.870
你听说过吗
Had you heard this?

1082
01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:40.120
泰德·邦迪是谁
Who's Ted Bundy?

1083
01:01:42.010 --> 01:01:43.130
算了
Forget it.

1084
01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:47.310
那是什么
What's that?

1085
01:01:47.310 --> 01:01:48.470
强力胶带
Duct tape.

1086
01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:49.880
我拿来...
I need it for...

1087
01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:52.720
封点东西
taping something.

1088
01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:58.430
帕特里克
Patrick?

1089
01:02:00.030 --> 01:02:01.600
你曾经想过
Have you ever wanted to

1090
01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:03.450
让某人幸福吗
make someone happy?

1091
01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:05.900
什么  不  把勺子放进纸杯里
What? No! Put it in the carton!

1092
01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:08.740
抱歉
Sorry.

1093
01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:12.160
琴
Jean?

1094
01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:14.740
你说什么
What?

1095
01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:18.500
让某人幸福
Make someone happy.

1096
01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:21.080
你曾经这么想过吗
Have you ever wanted to?

1097
01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.500
我在找...
I'm looking for...

1098
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.610
我觉得可以说是
I guess you could say

1099
01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:33.690
我只是想和一个特别的人
I just want to have a meaningful relationship

1100
01:02:33.690 --> 01:02:35.180
拥有一段有意义的关系
with someone special.

1101
01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:47.400
帕特里克  帕特里克
Patrick. Patrick.

1102
01:02:47.490 --> 01:02:48.690
我知道你在家
I know you're there.

1103
01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:50.690
快接电话  坏男人
Pick up the phone, you bad boy.

1104
01:02:51.290 --> 01:02:52.530
你今晚要做什么
What are you up to tonight?

1105
01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:55.030
是我  别想躲着我
It's me. Don't try to hide.

1106
01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:56.170
希望你现在
I hope you're not out there

1107
01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:57.580
不是在跟哪个小妞鬼混
with some little number you picked up,

1108
01:02:57.590 --> 01:02:59.500
因为你是我的  贝特曼先生
because you're mine, Mr. Bateman.

1109
01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:01.370
我的邻家男孩
My boy next door.

1110
01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:04.930
不过你从不给我打电话  虽然你答应过
Anyway you never called me, and you said you would.

1111
01:03:04.930 --> 01:03:07.390
我会给琴留言来提醒你
And I'll leave a message for Jean about this, too, to remind you,

1112
01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:09.800
不过我们要跟梅拉尼娅和泰勒共进晚餐
but we're having dinner with Melania and Taylor.

1113
01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:12.140
你认识梅拉尼娅  她去过野玫瑰餐厅
You know Melania. She went to Sweet Briar.

1114
01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:14.350
我们在康奈尔俱乐部碰面
and we're meeting at the Cornell Club,

1115
01:03:14.350 --> 01:03:16.390
所以我明早再给你打电话  亲爱的
so I'll call you tomorrow morning, honey.

1116
01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:18.390
抱歉  我知道你讨厌这个称呼
Sorry. I know you hate that.

1117
01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:20.060
再见  帕特里克
Bye, Patrick.

1118
01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:22.310
再见  霸道总裁先生
Bye, Mr. Big Time CEO.

1119
01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:23.600
再见
Bye-bye.

1120
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:29.480
那是伊芙琳吗
Was that Evelyn?

1121
01:03:33.790 --> 01:03:35.160
你还在跟她交往吗
Are you still seeing her?

1122
01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:43.160
抱歉  我无权过问
I'm sorry. I have no right to ask that.

1123
01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:49.550
你想让我走吗
Do you want me to go?

1124
01:03:50.970 --> 01:03:51.840
对
Yeah.

1125
01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:57.680
我觉得我控制不了自己
I don't think I can control myself.

1126
01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:01.430
我知道我该离开了
I know I should go.

1127
01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:04.270
我知道我总是和名草有主的男人纠缠不清
I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men.

1128
01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:08.110
我是说
I mean...

1129
01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:11.730
你希望我离开吗
Do you want me to go?

1130
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:15.280
我觉得如果你留下
I think if you stay,

1131
01:04:16.330 --> 01:04:18.120
就会有坏事发生
something bad will happen.

1132
01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.540
我觉得我可能会伤害你
I think I might hurt you.

1133
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:25.580
你不想受伤  对吧
You don't want to get hurt, do you?

1134
01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:28.210
是  我不想
No. No, I guess not.

1135
01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.460
我不想弄得一身淤青
I don't want to get bruised.

1136
01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:35.550
你说得对
You're right.

1137
01:04:36.310 --> 01:04:37.470
我该走了
I should go.

1138
01:04:44.070 --> 01:04:45.610
别忘了你明天约了唐纳德·坎鲍尔
Don't forget you have a lunch date tomorrow

1139
01:04:45.610 --> 01:04:47.650
在史密斯和沃尔伦斯基餐厅吃午餐
with Donald Kimball at Smith and Wollensky's.

1140
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:50.060
多谢
Thanks.

1141
01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:53.480
我完全忘了这事
It slipped my mind completely.

1142
01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:13.800
话说
So.

1143
01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:16.760
他失踪的那晚
The night he disappeared.

1144
01:05:16.890 --> 01:05:20.220
你想起来自己干什么了吗
Any new thoughts about what you did?

1145
01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:22.720
我不确定
Not sure.

1146
01:05:23.310 --> 01:05:24.520
我洗了个澡
I had a shower,

1147
01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:27.400
吃了点冰沙
and some sorbet.

1148
01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.320
我想你是把各种约会搞混了
I think you're getting your dates mixed up.

1149
01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.100
怎么搞混了
But how?

1150
01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:34.580
那你觉得保罗那晚去哪里了
Where do you place Paul that night?

1151
01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:35.620
从他的日程表来看
According to his datebook,

1152
01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:37.700
他的秘书也证实过了
and this was verified by his secretary,

1153
01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:40.160
那晚他和马库斯·哈博斯特拉姆吃了晚餐
he had dinner with Marcus Halberstram.

1154
01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:43.200
-然后呢  -我问了他
- And? - I questioned him.

1155
01:05:43.790 --> 01:05:45.790
-马库斯吗  -是的  他否认了
- Marcus? - Yes, and he denies it.

1156
01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.040
尽管一开始他不是很确定
Though, at first, he couldn't be sure.

1157
01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:50.000
-但他否认了  -没错
- But he denied it. - Yes.

1158
01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:54.090
马库斯有不在场证明吗
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?

1159
01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:55.000
有
Yes.

1160
01:05:55.930 --> 01:05:57.170
他有吗  你确定
He does? You're sure?

1161
01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:59.720
我检查过了  清白无误
I've checked it out. It's clean.

1162
01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:04.490
现在的问题是
Now...

1163
01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:06.700
你当时在哪
where were you?

1164
01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.660
马库斯在哪
Where was Marcus?

1165
01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:11.480
他没和保罗·艾伦在一起
He wasn't with Paul Allen.

1166
01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:12.600
那他和谁在一起
Who was he with?

1167
01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:14.920
他当时在亚特兰蒂斯餐厅
He was at Atlantis

1168
01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.510
在场的有克雷格·麦克德莫特
with Craig McDermott,

1169
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:18.620
弗雷德里克·迪博 
Frederick Dibble,

1170
01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:21.440
哈利·纽曼  乔治·布特纳  还有...
Harry Newman, George Butner, and...

1171
01:06:22.450 --> 01:06:23.380
你
you.

1172
01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:29.780
是的  没错  当然了
Right, yeah. Of course.

1173
01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:33.090
我们之前希望保罗·艾伦能来
We had wanted Paul Allen to come,

1174
01:06:33.310 --> 01:06:35.250
但他另有安排了
but he had made plans,

1175
01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:39.560
我猜我是在隔天晚上和维多利亚吃的晚餐
and I guess I had dinner with Victoria the following night.

1176
01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:42.380
在我看来  我觉得那家伙有点疯了
Personally, I think the guy went a little nutso.

1177
01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:44.830
才暂时离开这里一阵  可能他是去了伦敦
Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London,

1178
01:06:44.830 --> 01:06:46.560
观光  喝酒什么的
sightseeing, drinking, whatever.

1179
01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:49.330
总之  我确定他迟早会露面的
Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.

1180
01:06:49.810 --> 01:06:52.830
我是说  怀疑他的某个朋友
I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him

1181
01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:56.160
无缘无故杀了他什么的  也太荒谬了
for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous.

1182
01:06:56.790 --> 01:06:58.450
不是吗  帕特里克
Isn't that right, Patrick?

1183
01:07:20.330 --> 01:07:22.240
克里斯蒂  克里斯蒂
Christie, Christie.

1184
01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:23.700
我不太确定要不要来
I'm not so sure about this.

1185
01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:26.160
上次做完之后  我不得不去了急诊室
I had to go to emergency after last time.

1186
01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.180
这次不会像上次那样了
This won't be anything like last time.

1187
01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:30.580
-我保证  -我不觉得
- I promise. - I don't think so.

1188
01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.590
就上车跟我说会儿话
Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute.

1189
01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:37.570
司机在这  你很安全
Driver's here. You're safe.

1190
01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:58.330
绝对跟上次不一样  我保证
Nothing like last time. I promise.

1191
01:07:58.330 --> 01:07:59.530
好吧
All right.

1192
01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:02.730
你看起来挺好的
So you're looking great.

1193
01:08:02.970 --> 01:08:03.880
你最近怎么样
How've you been?

1194
01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:06.990
上次完事后我其实得动个小手术
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.

1195
01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:07.700
真的吗
Really?

1196
01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:10.610
我朋友跟我说我可能还得请个律师
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.

1197
01:08:11.890 --> 01:08:14.080
律师们都很复杂
Lawyers are so complicated.

1198
01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:15.820
别那么做
Don't do that.

1199
01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:18.570
拿上支票吧
Here's a check.

1200
01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:11.010
现在付一半  完事付一半
Half now, half later.

1201
01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:17.020
好吧
Okay.

1202
01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:18.810
你叫克里斯蒂
Your name's Christie.

1203
01:09:19.710 --> 01:09:22.370
我们要去见我一个朋友  伊丽莎白
We're meeting a friend of mine, Elizabeth.

1204
01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:25.880
她马上要来我的新公寓  和我们一起
She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly.

1205
01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:28.220
你会喜欢她的
You'll like her.

1206
01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:30.250
她是个不错的姑娘
She's a very nice girl.

1207
01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.860
你看上去很面熟
You look really familiar.

1208
01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:40.380
你去过多尔顿吗
Did you go to Dalton?

1209
01:09:42.150 --> 01:09:44.250
我觉得我在冲浪酒吧见过你  是吧
I think I met you at the Surf Bar, didn't I?

1210
01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:45.230
和斯派西一起
With Spicey?

1211
01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.240
可能不是和斯派西一起  但肯定是在冲浪酒吧
Well, maybe not with Spicey, but definitely at Surf Bar.

1212
01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:48.560
你知道的吧  冲浪酒吧
You know, Surf Bar?

1213
01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.820
总之  冲浪酒吧现在很差劲  太糟糕了
Anyway, Surf Bar sucks now. It's terrible.

1214
01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:52.610

Went to a birthday party there for Malcolm Forbes.

1215
01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:54.850
天哪  糟糕透顶
Oh, my God, please.

1216
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:58.620
这里比你另外那间公寓要好
This is nicer than your other apartment.

1217
01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:03.070
也没那么好吧
Well, it's not that nice.

1218
01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:09.140
你们是在哪认识的
Where did you two meet?

1219
01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.730
天哪  我们相识于...
Oh, God. We met at...

1220
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:15.840
85年还是86年  肯塔基州的德比马赛
Oh, God, at the Kentucky Derby in '85 or '86.

1221
01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:18.300
你当时和那个荡妇爱丽森·普尔在一起

她是个性感尤物

这女孩在美黑沙龙工作
Listen, this girl worked at a tanning salon.

1227
01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:26.640
还需要我多说吗
Need I say more?

1228
01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:27.920
你是做什么的
What do you do?

1229
01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:30.430
她是我的...
She's my...

1230

伊丽莎白  现在是凌晨三点
Elizabeth, it's 3:00 in the morning.

1238

He's a goddamn drug dealer. These are his peak hours.

1239
01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:58.480
-别告诉他你在这里  -我为什么要说
- Don't tell him you're here. - Why would I?

1240
01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.970
这酒味道好奇怪
This tastes weird.

1241
01:10:59.970 --> 01:11:02.090
哈利  是我  我需要你的服务

Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's, and I'll try you again later.

1247
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:15.930
如果明晚我没在运河酒吧看到你
If I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night,

1248
01:11:15.930 --> 01:11:18.080
我就要派我的发型师去找你了

你认识那个失踪的人吗
Did you know that guy who disappeared?

1250
01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:22.980
他不是在皮尔斯&皮尔斯公司上班吗
Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce?

1251
01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:23.680
他是你朋友吗
Was he a friend of yours?

1252
01:11:23.690 --> 01:11:24.650
不是
No.

1253
01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:26.770
你有可卡因吗

1254

你们俩
the two of you

1258
01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:38.040
开搞
get it on.

1259
01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:41.170

What's wrong with that?

1260
01:11:41.170 --> 01:11:43.070
完全无病
It's totally disease-free.

1261
01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:46.830
帕特里克  你这个疯子
Patrick, you're a lunatic.

1262
01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:47.820
得了
Come on.

1263
01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:50.420
你不觉得克里斯蒂很有魅力吗
Don't you find Christie attractive?

1264
01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:52.320
别这么不正经
Let's not get lewd.

1265

我现在没心情说不正经的事
I'm in no mood for a lewd conversation.

1266
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:55.490
来吧
Come on.

1267
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:58.550
我觉得这会让你性奋的
I think it'd be a turn-on.

1268
01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.930
他一直这样吗
Does he do this all the time?

1269
01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:06.150
克里斯蒂  你没喝你的酒
Christie, you're not drinking your wine.

1270
01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:10.070
你是说你从来没跟女孩搞过吗
You're telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?

1271
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:11.240
没有
No.

1272
01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.070
我不是同性恋
I'm not a lesbian.

1273
01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:15.070
你为什么会觉得我会对那个感兴趣
Why would you think I would be into that?

1274
01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:18.000
因为比如说  你去了莎拉·劳伦斯学院
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence, for one thing.

1275
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.790
在那里上学的男生才是同性恋  帕特里克
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick.

1276
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:22.870
你让我感觉好奇怪
You're making me feel weird.

1277
01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:28.980
你知道
Did you know

1278
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.680
惠特妮·休斯顿首张黑胶大碟
that Whitney Houston's debut LP,

1279
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.680
美国女歌手

1280
01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:36.130
就叫《惠特妮·休斯顿》
called simply Whitney Houston,

1281
01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:38.940
里面还有四首冠军单曲吗
had four number-one singles on it?

1282
01:12:40.450 --> 01:12:42.070
你知道这个吗  克里斯蒂
Did you know that, Christie?

1283
01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:45.380
你真的听惠特妮·休斯顿吗
You actually listen to Whitney Houston?

1284
01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:48.950
你有惠特妮·休斯顿的唱片吗
You own a Whitney Houston CD?

1285
01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:51.660
还不止一张吗
More than one?

1286
01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:56.740
很难从那么多好歌里选出最爱的一首
It's hard to choose a favorite among so many great tracks.

1287
01:12:59.190 --> 01:13:00.950
但《最伟大的爱》
But "The Greatest Love Of All"

1288
01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:05.310
是所有描写人类自我保护和尊严的歌曲中
is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written

1289
01:13:06.270 --> 01:13:09.910
最精彩  最有力的一首
about self-preservation, dignity.

1290
01:13:10.330 --> 01:13:14.240
其亘古不变的寓意跨越一切界限
Its universal message crosses all boundaries

1291
01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:17.610
用希望滋润人们的心田
and instills one with the hope

1292
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.920
告诉他们提升自我  永远不会太迟
that it's not too late to better ourselves.

1293
01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:25.590
因为  伊丽莎白
Since, Elizabeth,

1294
01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:29.040
在我们所处的这个世界中
it's impossible, in this world we live in,

1295
01:13:29.290 --> 01:13:31.040
我们不可能与他人感同身受
to empathize with others,

1296
01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:33.720
但我们可以顾影自怜
we can always empathize with ourselves.

1297
01:13:34.690 --> 01:13:36.470
这是很重要的寓意
It's an important message.

1298
01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.110
很关键
Crucial, really.

1299
01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:44.250
这张专辑对这一点进行了优美的诠释
And it's beautifully stated on the album.

1300
01:14:31.730 --> 01:14:33.360
雅皮士荡妇

1301
01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:57.520
不许踢脸  你个贱人
Not the face, you bitch!

1302
01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:01.270
别他妈踢脸  你这个垃圾
Not the fuckin' face, you piece of bitch trash!

1303
01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:31.590
我想要一个可靠的承诺
I want a firm commitment.

1304
01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:34.470
我觉得  伊芙琳
I think, Evelyn,

1305
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:36.760
我们已经失去联系了
that we've lost touch.

1306
01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.280
为什么  怎么了
Why? What's wrong?

1307
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:43.760
我无法修正自己
My need to engage in homicidal behavior

1308
01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:46.680
嗜杀成性的行为
on a massive scale cannot be corrected,

1309
01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:49.590
但我没别的方法来满足自己的需要了
but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.

1310
01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:52.640
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

1311
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.300
谈什么  帕特里克
Talk about what, Patrick?

1312
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:55.990
结束了  伊芙琳
It's over, Evelyn.

1313
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:58.460
都结束了
It's all over.

1314
01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:00.320
别生气嘛
Touchy, touchy.

1315
01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.120
抱歉我提起婚礼的事
I'm sorry I brought up the wedding.

1316
01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:04.240
我们不说就是了  好吗
Let's just avoid the issue, all right?

1317
01:17:04.450 --> 01:17:06.090
我们去喝咖啡吧
Now, are we having coffee?

1318
01:17:06.090 --> 01:17:08.870
我他妈很认真  我们已经结束了
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us.

1319
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:10.930
这不是玩笑
This is no joke.

1320
01:17:12.190 --> 01:17:14.220
我觉得我们还是别再见面了
I don't think we should see each other anymore.

1321
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:18.640
但我们有共同的朋友
But your friends are my friends, and my friends are your friends.

1322
01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:20.710
我不觉得这能行得通
I really don't think it would work.

1323
01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:22.550
你这里有东西
You have a little something--

1324
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:25.250
我知道我们有共同的朋友
I know that your friends are my friends,

1325
01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:27.820
我想过这事了
and I've thought about that.

1326
01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:29.440
他们就当你的朋友好了
You can have them.

1327
01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:32.590
你是认真的  对吧
You're really serious, aren't you?

1328
01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:33.810
是的
Yes, I am.

1329
01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:39.440
那过去呢
What about the past?

1330
01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:42.180
-我们的过去呢  -我们从来没有共同的过去
- Our past? - We never really shared one.

1331
01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:46.430
-你简直不近人情  -不  我尚存人性
- You're inhuman. - No, I'm in touch with humanity.

1332
01:17:47.150 --> 01:17:48.790
伊芙琳  我很抱歉
Evelyn, I'm sorry.

1333
01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:50.220
我只是
I just...

1334
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:54.320
你对我来说没那么重要
You're not terribly important to me.

1335
01:17:54.370 --> 01:17:56.420
不
Oh, no.

1336
01:17:56.430 --> 01:17:58.940
不  不要
No, no.

1337
01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:04.360
我知道我有时候行为古怪
I know my behavior can be erratic sometimes.

1338
01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:06.500
你想让我怎么样
What do you want me to do?

1339
01:18:06.930 --> 01:18:08.220
你到底想要什么
What is it that you want?

1340
01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:09.800
如果你真的想为我做点什么
If you really want to do something for me,

1341
01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:11.440
就别在这里丢人了
then stop making this scene right now.

1342
01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:14.990
-天哪  我不敢相信  -我要走了
- Oh, God, I can't believe this. - l'm leaving.

1343
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:17.510
我评估了一下形势  我要走了
I've assessed the situation, and I'm going.

1344
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:18.680
你要去哪
Where are you going?

1345
01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:20.660
离开这里就行
Just leaving.

1346
01:18:20.710 --> 01:18:21.930
但是去哪里呢
But where?

1347
01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:25.750
我得去还录像带
I have to return some videotapes.

1348
01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:53.330
取现

1349
01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:57.810
你好啊  小猫咪
Here, kitty, kitty.

1350
01:19:06.170 --> 01:19:08.930
喂我一只流浪猫

1351
01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:17.150
天哪  你在干什么
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

1352
01:19:17.150 --> 01:19:18.720
住手
Stop that.

1353
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:03.050
放下武器  快点
Drop the weapon! Drop it now!

1354
01:20:03.050 --> 01:20:05.140
趴在地上  把...
Get on the ground! Put--

1355
01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:50.530
要熬夜加班吗  史密斯先生
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith?

1356
01:20:50.710 --> 01:20:52.730
别忘了登记
Hey, now don't forget to sign in.

1357
01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:25.640
哈罗德  我是贝特曼  帕特里克·贝特曼
Harold, it's Bateman, Patrick Bateman.

1358
01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:27.520
你是我的律师  所以我觉得应该告诉你
You're my lawyer, so I think you should know

1359

在上城区的公寓杀了几个应召女郎

如果你说杀人的是布莱斯或者麦克德莫特我还信

我们一直在电话上联系
We talk on the phone all the time.

Don't you recognize me?

01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:53.340
你是我的律师
You're my lawyer.

1503
01:32:55.230 --> 01:32:56.960

我杀了保罗·艾伦
I killed Paul Allen...

1507
01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:10.970
而且我很喜欢这种感觉
and I liked it.

1508
01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:14.060
我没办法解释得更清楚了
I can't make myself any clearer.

1509
01:33:14.770 --> 01:33:16.710
但那绝对不可能
But that's simply not possible.

1510
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:18.890
我现在也不觉得这样很搞笑了
And I don't find this funny anymore.

1511
01:33:18.890 --> 01:33:21.240
这从来就不是个笑话
It never was supposed to be.

1512
01:33:21.250 --> 01:33:23.380
-为什么不可能  -就是不可能
- Why isn't it possible? - lt's just not.

1513
01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:26.650
为什么  你个蠢货
Why not, you stupid bastard?

1514
01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:30.580
因为我和保罗·艾伦在伦敦吃了两次饭
Because I had dinner with Paul Allen twice in London,

1515
01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:33.330
-就在十天前  -不  你...
- just ten days ago. - No, you...

1516
01:33:36.740 --> 01:33:37.710
没有
didn't.

1517
01:33:37.710 --> 01:33:39.480
现在  抱歉失陪了
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1518
01:34:20.690 --> 01:34:23.070
我们已经见识过不信任会带来的后果
We've seen the results of that mistrust

1519
01:34:23.070 --> 01:34:26.280
诸如谎言  分歧  错误等
in the form of lies, divisions, and mistakes.

1520
01:34:26.710 --> 01:34:28.880
我们需要找到方法来合作
We need to find a way to cooperate

1521
01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:31.170
同时也要认识到对外政策
while realizing foreign policy

1522
01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:33.380
不能由委员会来执行
can't be run by committee.

1523
01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:36.400
我相信现在大家应该越来越意识到
And I believe there's now the growing sense

1524
01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:39.860
通过合作我们能收获更多成功
that we can accomplish more by cooperating.

1525
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:41.540
而且最终
And, in the end,

1526
01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:44.640
这或许是在伊朗门事件的混乱中
this may be the eventual blessing in disguise

1527
01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:44.640
伊朗门事件即美国向伊朗秘密出售武器一事被揭露
从而造成里根政府严重政治危机的事件

1528
01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:46.450
最后的因祸得福
to come out of the Iran-Contra mess.

1529
01:34:46.450 --> 01:34:48.590
他怎么能说这种谎
How can he lie like that?

1530
01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:52.100
-他怎么能扯这种谎  -什么谎
- How can he pull that shit? - What shit?

1531
01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:54.220
我们到底在哪里预定了位置
Now where do we have reservations at?

1532
01:34:54.770 --> 01:34:55.660
我不是真的很饿
I mean, I'm not really hungry,

1533
01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:57.320
但我还是想在某家餐厅预定位置
but I'd like to have reservations someplace.

1534
01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:59.590
你怎么能这么...
How can you be so fucking...

1535
01:35:00.250 --> 01:35:01.400
我也不知道
I don't know...

1536
01:35:01.870 --> 01:35:02.980
对这事这么淡定
cool about it?

1537
01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:05.120
可能有些人天生就淡定
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.

1538
01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:12.110
贝特曼
Bateman.

1539
01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:15.470
你傻乐什么呢
What are you so fucking zany about?

1540
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:17.730
我就是个快乐的人
I'm just a happy camper.

1541
01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:20.280
嗨起来
Rockin' and a-rollin'!

1542
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:23.530
兄弟  你看
Oh, brother! Look,

1543
01:35:24.010 --> 01:35:27.150
他表现得像个人畜无害的小老头  但是
he presents himself as this harmless old codger, but

1544
01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:28.680
内在
inside...

1545
01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:30.290
但是内在...
But inside...

1546
01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:33.400
但是内在根本无关紧要
But inside doesn't matter.

1547
01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:36.170
内在  什么内在
Inside? Yes? Inside?

1548
01:35:36.170 --> 01:35:38.780
信不信由你  布莱斯  我们一直在听你说
Believe it or not, Bryce, we're actually listening to you.

1549
01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:39.930
得了  贝特曼
Come on, Bateman,

1550
01:35:40.610 --> 01:35:41.870
你觉得呢
what do you think?

1551
01:35:44.070 --> 01:35:45.130
无所谓
Whatever.

1552
01:35:45.450 --> 01:35:48.360
是谁这么蠢  点了干啤
Whose moronic idea was it to order dry beers?

1553
01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:50.540
我要威士忌
I need a scotch.

1554
01:36:06.610 --> 01:36:08.990
再也没有障碍了
There are no more barriers to cross.

1555
01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:13.510
我有的一切失控  疯癫
All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane,

1556
01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:15.360
恶毒  邪恶
the vicious and the evil,

1557
01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:19.150
我造成的所有混乱  以及我对它的完全冷漠
all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it,

1558
01:36:19.150 --> 01:36:21.300
如今我都超越了
I have now surpassed.

1559
01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:26.980
我的痛苦持续而尖锐
My pain is constant and sharp,

1560
01:36:27.390 --> 01:36:30.440
我也不为任何人祈祷世界更美好
and I do not hope for a better world for anyone.

1561
01:36:31.190 --> 01:36:35.370
说实话  我希望其他人尝尝我的痛苦
In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others.

1562
01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:37.970
我希望谁都逃不掉
I want no one to escape.

1563
01:36:40.130 --> 01:36:42.120
但即便承认了这些
But even after admitting this,

1564
01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:44.270
我也并没有一种宣泄后的快感
there is no catharsis.

1565
01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:47.300
我依然无法受到惩罚
My punishment continues to elude me,

1566
01:36:47.490 --> 01:36:50.340
我也没有更加了解自己
and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself.

1567
01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:54.040
我所说的话都只是老调重弹
No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling.

1568
01:36:54.730 --> 01:36:58.810
这种忏悔毫无意义
This confession has meant nothing.
