1
00:02:07.745 --> 00:02:10.957
rare roasted partridge breast
in raspberry coulis
with a sorrel timbale.

2
00:02:11.207 --> 00:02:14.293
and grilled
free-range rabbit
with herbed french fries.

3
00:02:14.502 --> 00:02:18.214
Our pasta tonight is
a squid ravioli
in a lemon grass broth.

4
00:02:22.802 --> 00:02:26.931
God, I hate this place.
It's a chick's restaurant.
Why aren't we at Dorsia?

5
00:02:27.098 --> 00:02:29.016
Because Bateman won't give
the maitre d' head.

6
00:02:31.978 --> 00:02:34.105
Is that Reed Robinson
over there?

7
00:02:34.313 --> 00:02:37.191
- Are you freebasing or what?
That's not Robinson.
- Well, who is it then?

8
00:02:37.358 --> 00:02:40.194
- It's Paul Allen.
- That's not Paul Allen.

9
00:02:40.403 --> 00:02:42.655
Paul Allen's
on the other side
of the room over there.

10
00:02:42.822 --> 00:02:44.699
Who's he with?
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.

11
00:02:44.907 --> 00:02:46.659
They don't have a good bathroom
to do coke in.

12
00:02:46.826 --> 00:02:49.620
Are you sure
that's Paul Allen over there?
Yes, McDufus, I am.

13
00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.248
- He's handling
the Fisher account.
- Lucky bastard.

14
00:02:52.415 --> 00:02:56.753
- Lucky Jew bastard.
- Jesus, McDermott, what does
that have to do with anything?

15
00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:58.755
I've seen that bastard
sitting in his office...

16
00:02:58.921 --> 00:03:00.923
talking on the phone
to the C.E.O.s,
spinnin' a fuckin' menorah.

17
00:03:01.132 --> 00:03:03.509
Not a menorah.
You spin a dreidel.

18
00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:05.470
Oh, my God, Bateman.

19
00:03:05.636 --> 00:03:08.556
Do you want me to fry you up
some fucking potato pancakes?
Some latkes?

20
00:03:08.723 --> 00:03:12.310
No, just... cool it with
the anti-Semitic remarks.

21
00:03:12.518 --> 00:03:16.522
Oh, I forgot.
Bateman's dating someone
from the A.C.L.U.

22
00:03:16.731 --> 00:03:19.484
He's the voice of reason.
The boy next door.

23
00:03:19.692 --> 00:03:23.071
Speaking of reasonable...
Only $570.

24
00:03:23.237 --> 00:03:26.115
That's not bad.

25
00:03:26.282 --> 00:03:28.242
A little something
for the purse.

26
00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.244
Give her the 50.

27
00:04:09.117 --> 00:04:11.202
Stoli on the rocks.

28
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:14.664
These aren't good anymore.
It's a cash bar.

29
00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:16.999
That'll be $25.

30
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.213
You're a fucking ugly bitch.

31
00:04:22.422 --> 00:04:24.882
I wanna stab you to death...

32
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:27.552
and play around
with your blood.

33
00:04:38.604 --> 00:04:40.398
What can I get
for you two?

34
00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:07.300
I live in the
American Gardens building...

35
00:05:07.467 --> 00:05:09.886
on West 81st Street
on the 11th floor.

36
00:05:10.053 --> 00:05:13.097
My name is Patrick Bateman.

37
00:05:13.306 --> 00:05:15.099
I'm 27 years old.

38
00:05:16.642 --> 00:05:18.436
I believe in
taking care of myself,

39
00:05:18.644 --> 00:05:23.441
in a balanced diet,
in a rigorous exercise routine.

40
00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:25.943
In the morning,
if my face is a little puffy,

41
00:05:26.152 --> 00:05:29.113
I'll put on an ice pack
while doing my stomach crunches.

42
00:05:29.322 --> 00:05:31.115
I can do a thousand now.

43
00:05:48.383 --> 00:05:52.637
After I remove the ice pack,
I use a deep pore
cleanser lotion.

44
00:05:52.845 --> 00:05:55.973
In the shower, I use
a water-activated gel cleanser.

45
00:05:58.434 --> 00:06:00.645
Then
a honey-almond body scrub.

46
00:06:00.853 --> 00:06:04.440
And on the face,
an exfoliating gel scrub.

47
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.494
Then I apply
an herb mint facial masque,

48
00:06:16.703 --> 00:06:20.623
which I leave on for ten minutes
while I prepare the rest
of my routine.

49
00:06:22.875 --> 00:06:27.171
I always use
an aftershave lotion
with little or no alcohol,

50
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.050
because alcohol
dries your face out
and makes you look older.

51
00:06:31.217 --> 00:06:33.052
Then moisturizer,

52
00:06:33.302 --> 00:06:35.138
then an anti-aging eye balm,

53
00:06:35.346 --> 00:06:38.683
followed by a final
moisturizing protective lotion.

54
00:06:39.976 --> 00:06:43.354
There is an idea
of a Patrick Bateman.

55
00:06:43.563 --> 00:06:47.567
Some kind of abstraction,
but there is no real me.

56
00:06:47.734 --> 00:06:50.528
Only an entity...
something illusory.

57
00:06:50.737 --> 00:06:53.197
And though I can hide
my cold gaze...

58
00:06:53.364 --> 00:06:56.451
and you can shake my hand
and feel flesh
gripping yours...

59
00:06:56.617 --> 00:07:01.330
and maybe you can even sense
our lifestyles
are probably comparable,

60
00:07:01.497 --> 00:07:04.709
I simply am not there.

61
00:07:27.774 --> 00:07:29.609
Good morning.

62
00:07:29.776 --> 00:07:32.904
Good morning, Hamilton.
Nice tan.

63
00:07:38.785 --> 00:07:41.579
Late.
Aerobics class. Sorry.
Any messages?

64
00:07:41.788 --> 00:07:45.166
Ricky Harrison has to cancel.
He didn't say what
he was cancelling or why.

65
00:07:45.375 --> 00:07:48.753
I occasionally box with Ricky
at the Harvard Club.
Anyone else?

66
00:07:48.878 --> 00:07:52.006
Spencer wants to meet
for drinks at Fluties, Pier 17.
When?

67
00:07:52.215 --> 00:07:55.176
After 6:00.
And what should I say?
Negative. Cancel it.

68
00:07:55.343 --> 00:07:59.097
Just say "no."
Just say "no"?

69
00:07:59.305 --> 00:08:00.890
Okay, Jean.

70
00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:03.518
I need reservations for three
at Camols at 12:30,

71
00:08:03.643 --> 00:08:05.478
and if not there
try Crayons.

72
00:08:05.645 --> 00:08:08.106
All right?
Yes, sir.

73
00:08:08.314 --> 00:08:13.528
Oh, wait. And I need
reservations for two at Arcadia
at 8:00 on Thursday.

74
00:08:13.694 --> 00:08:15.488
Something romantic?

75
00:08:16.739 --> 00:08:18.700
No.

76
00:08:18.866 --> 00:08:22.286
Silly. Forget it.
I'll make them.

77
00:08:22.495 --> 00:08:24.288
No, I'll do it.
No, no.

78
00:08:24.497 --> 00:08:28.584
Be a doll and just get me
a mineral water, okay?
You look nice today.

79
00:08:28.751 --> 00:08:31.254
Don't wear that outfit again.

80
00:08:31.421 --> 00:08:33.297
What? I didn't hear you.

81
00:08:33.506 --> 00:08:35.967
I said, do not wear
that outfit again.

82
00:08:36.134 --> 00:08:39.053
Wear a dress, a skirt
or something.
You don't like this, I take it.

83
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.390
Come on.
You're prettier than that.

84
00:08:42.515 --> 00:08:45.852
- Thanks, Patrick.
- I'm not here.

85
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:50.690
And high heels.
I like high heels.

86
00:08:57.697 --> 00:08:59.532
Feathered friends for 600.

87
00:08:59.699 --> 00:09:01.909
During courtship,
the male frigate bird...

88
00:09:02.118 --> 00:09:04.454
inflates to enormous size
the red pouch found here.

89
00:09:19.177 --> 00:09:21.679
And I want
hundreds of thousands of roses.

90
00:09:21.888 --> 00:09:24.057
And lots of
chocolate truffles,

91
00:09:24.307 --> 00:09:26.601
Godiva, and oysters
in the half shell.

92
00:09:26.768 --> 00:09:29.562
I'm trying to listen to
the new Robert Palmer tape,

93
00:09:29.729 --> 00:09:34.067
but Evelyn,
my supposed fianc?
keeps buzzing in my ear.

94
00:09:34.233 --> 00:09:37.528
Annie Leibovitz.
We'll get Annie Leibovitz.

95
00:09:37.737 --> 00:09:39.947
And we'll have to get
someone to videotape.

96
00:09:40.156 --> 00:09:43.242
Patrick,
we should do it.

97
00:09:43.409 --> 00:09:46.704
Do what?
Get married.
Have a wedding.

98
00:09:46.913 --> 00:09:48.998
No. I can't take
the time off work.

99
00:09:49.207 --> 00:09:51.542
Your father practically owns
the company. You can do
anything you like, silly.

100
00:09:51.667 --> 00:09:54.253
- I don't want to talk about it.
- I hate that job anyway.

101
00:09:54.504 --> 00:09:56.297
I don't see why
you just don't quit.

102
00:09:56.506 --> 00:10:00.927
Because I want to fit in.

103
00:10:11.562 --> 00:10:14.107
Williams party.

104
00:10:14.315 --> 00:10:17.193
I'm on the verge of tears
by the time we arrive at Espace,

105
00:10:17.402 --> 00:10:20.279
since I'm positive
we won't have a decent table.

106
00:10:20.446 --> 00:10:24.826
But we do,
and relief washes over me
in an awesome wave.

107
00:10:24.951 --> 00:10:29.080
Patrick,
this is my cousin Vanden
and her boyfriend Stash.

108
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.541
They're both artists.
The menu's in braille.

109
00:10:31.749 --> 00:10:35.169
I see you've met everyone.
You look awful.

110
00:10:35.378 --> 00:10:38.423
Okay. All right.

111
00:10:38.631 --> 00:10:40.591
I'm fairly certain that...

112
00:10:40.758 --> 00:10:44.053
Timothy Bryce and Evelyn
are having an affair.

113
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.973
Timothy is the only
interesting person I know.

114
00:10:47.181 --> 00:10:50.518
I'm almost
completely indifferent
as to whether Evelyn knows...

115
00:10:50.643 --> 00:10:55.606
I'm having an affair
with Courtney Rawlinson,
her closest friend.

116
00:10:55.815 --> 00:10:57.650
Courtney is almost
perfect looking.

117
00:10:57.859 --> 00:11:01.320
She's usually operating on
one or more psychiatric drugs.

118
00:11:01.529 --> 00:11:03.781
Tonight, I believe,
it's Xanax.
Mmm. Oh.

119
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.993
More disturbing than her
drug use, though, is the fact
that she's engaged...

120
00:11:07.243 --> 00:11:10.663
to Luis Carruthers,
the biggest doofus
in the business.

121
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.041
Tell me, Stash.

122
00:11:13.207 --> 00:11:16.669
Do you think Soho
is becoming too...
commercial?

123
00:11:16.836 --> 00:11:20.048
- Yes. I read that.
- Oh, who gives a rat's ass?

124
00:11:20.256 --> 00:11:22.133
Hey, that affects us.

125
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:26.137
Well, what about the massacres
in Sri Lanka, honey?
Doesn't that affect us too?

126
00:11:26.345 --> 00:11:28.139
Do you know anything about
Sri Lanka?

127
00:11:28.347 --> 00:11:30.308
How, like, the Sikhs are killing
tons of Israelis over there?

128
00:11:30.516 --> 00:11:32.435
Come on, Bryce.

129
00:11:32.602 --> 00:11:35.813
There are a lot more
important problems
than Sri Lanka to worry about.

130
00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.400
- Like what?
- Well, we have to
end apartheid, for one,

131
00:11:39.609 --> 00:11:44.864
slow down the nuclear arms race,
stop terrorism and world hunger.

132
00:11:45.031 --> 00:11:48.701
We have to provide
food and shelter
for the homeless...

133
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:52.997
and oppose racial discrimination
and promote civil rights,

134
00:11:53.206 --> 00:11:55.958
while also promoting
equal rights for women.

135
00:11:56.125 --> 00:11:58.378
We have to encourage
a return...

136
00:11:58.544 --> 00:12:01.089
to traditional moral values.

137
00:12:01.297 --> 00:12:03.591
Most importantly,

138
00:12:03.716 --> 00:12:07.887
we have to promote
general social concern...

139
00:12:08.137 --> 00:12:11.891
and less materialism
in young people.

140
00:12:12.058 --> 00:12:15.686
Patrick,
how thought provoking.

141
00:12:52.265 --> 00:12:54.058
Hello.

142
00:12:56.018 --> 00:12:57.854
Hello.

143
00:13:15.955 --> 00:13:18.583
Bleaching? Are you
trying to say "bleaching"?

144
00:13:18.791 --> 00:13:20.626
Oh, my God.
Two things.

145
00:13:20.793 --> 00:13:22.628
One: You can't bleach a Cerruti.
Out of the question.

146
00:13:22.795 --> 00:13:25.590
Two: I can only get
these sheets in Santa Fe.

147
00:13:25.798 --> 00:13:27.675
These are very expensive sheets,
and I really need them cleaned.

148
00:13:27.884 --> 00:13:31.345
Lady, if you don't shut
your fucking mouth,
I will kill you.

149
00:13:31.512 --> 00:13:32.972
Now, listen.

150
00:13:33.139 --> 00:13:35.600
I have a lunch meeting
at Hubert's in 20 minutes
with Ronald Harrison.

151
00:13:35.767 --> 00:13:37.518
I need those sheets
cleaned by this afternoon.

152
00:13:37.685 --> 00:13:40.938
Listen, I can't understand you!
This is crazy!
You're a fool.

153
00:13:41.147 --> 00:13:43.024
I can't cope with this
stupid "bitchee"!

154
00:13:43.191 --> 00:13:45.651
Understand?
Christ.
Patrick?

155
00:13:45.777 --> 00:13:48.071
Hi, Patrick.

156
00:13:48.321 --> 00:13:51.324
I thought that was you.
Hello.
This is...

157
00:13:51.532 --> 00:13:54.786
Isn't it ridiculous,
coming all the way up here?
They really are the best.

158
00:13:54.911 --> 00:13:56.829
Then why can't they
get these stains out?

159
00:13:56.996 --> 00:14:00.333
I mean, can you talk
to these people or something?
I'm not getting anywhere.

160
00:14:00.541 --> 00:14:03.378
- Oh, what are those?
- Well, it's...

161
00:14:03.544 --> 00:14:06.631
- Cranberry juice.
Cranapple.
- Really?

162
00:14:06.798 --> 00:14:09.467
Listen, if you
could talk to them,
I would really appreciate it.

163
00:14:09.634 --> 00:14:12.637
I'm really late.
I have a lunch appointment
at Hubert's in 15 minutes.

164
00:14:12.804 --> 00:14:15.014
Hubert's?
That moved uptown, right?
Oh, boy.

165
00:14:15.223 --> 00:14:17.392
Listen, I've gotta go.
Thank you, Victoria.

166
00:14:17.517 --> 00:14:19.394
Maybe we could do lunch
one day next week.

167
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.022
I'm downtown quite often.
What about a Saturday?
I'm at work all the time.

168
00:14:24.524 --> 00:14:26.776
Next Saturday?
Can't, I'm afraid.
Sure.

169
00:14:26.901 --> 00:14:28.945
At a matinee of Les Mis.
Listen, I really gotta go.

170
00:14:29.195 --> 00:14:32.407
Oh, Christ.
I'll call you.
Okay. Do.

171
00:14:33.032 --> 00:14:34.909
Listen, you're dating Lewis,
he's in Arizona.

172
00:14:35.159 --> 00:14:36.911
You're fucking me,
and we haven't made plans.

173
00:14:37.078 --> 00:14:38.830
What could you possibly
be up to tonight?

174
00:14:39.038 --> 00:14:41.749
Stop it. I'm...
On a lot of lithium?

175
00:14:41.916 --> 00:14:45.128
Waiting for Luis to call me.
He said he'd call tonight.

176
00:14:45.294 --> 00:14:48.840
Pumpkin? Pumpkin,
you're dating an asshole.

177
00:14:49.006 --> 00:14:52.677
Mm-hmm.
Pumpkin, you're dating the
biggest dickweed in New York.

178
00:14:52.885 --> 00:14:56.848
Pumpkin, you're dating
a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.

179
00:14:57.098 --> 00:15:00.059
Patrick, stop calling me
pumpkin, okay?

180
00:15:00.268 --> 00:15:03.563
I have to go.
Courtney?

181
00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.565
Hmm?
Dinner.

182
00:15:05.732 --> 00:15:08.192
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.

183
00:15:10.486 --> 00:15:13.614
Dorsia's nice.
Wear something fabulous.

184
00:15:13.781 --> 00:15:15.658
Oh, yeah!

185
00:15:25.251 --> 00:15:27.962
Dorsia.

186
00:15:28.171 --> 00:15:30.214
Um, yes, I know
it's a little late,

187
00:15:30.423 --> 00:15:34.927
but is it possible
to reserve a table for two
at 8:00 or 8:30, perhaps?

188
00:15:52.195 --> 00:15:55.573
a facial at Elizabeth Arden,
which was really relaxing.

189
00:15:55.698 --> 00:15:58.826
And then,
to the Pottery Barn,

190
00:15:58.993 --> 00:16:02.205
where I got this little...

191
00:16:02.455 --> 00:16:05.750
silver muffin dish.
Is that Donald Trump's car?

192
00:16:05.875 --> 00:16:07.794
God, Patrick.
Shut up.

193
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.630
You know, Courtney, you should
take some more lithium
or have a Diet Coke.

194
00:16:10.797 --> 00:16:13.591
Some caffeine might get you
out of this slump.

195
00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.427
I just want a child.

196
00:16:16.594 --> 00:16:19.097
Just two...

197
00:16:19.305 --> 00:16:21.724
perfect...

198
00:16:21.891 --> 00:16:24.143
children.

199
00:16:28.314 --> 00:16:30.900
Are we here?
Yeah.

200
00:16:38.491 --> 00:16:41.786
This is Dorsia?
Yes, dear.

201
00:16:41.953 --> 00:16:44.580
Courtney, you're gonna have
the peanut butter soup...

202
00:16:44.789 --> 00:16:47.250
with smoked duck
and mashed squash.

203
00:16:47.458 --> 00:16:51.212
New York Matinee called it
"a playful but
mysterious little dish."

204
00:16:51.379 --> 00:16:55.133
You'll love it.
And then the red snapper
with violets and pine nuts.

205
00:16:55.341 --> 00:16:57.135
I think that'll
follow nicely.

206
00:16:57.343 --> 00:17:01.013
Mmm.
Thanks, Patrick.

207
00:17:07.353 --> 00:17:10.064
Patrick, thanks so much
for looking after Courtney.

208
00:17:10.273 --> 00:17:13.025
Dorsia.
How impressive.

209
00:17:13.192 --> 00:17:15.278
How on Earth did you get
a reservation there?

210
00:17:15.486 --> 00:17:17.655
Lucky, I guess.

211
00:17:17.822 --> 00:17:19.657
That's a wonderful suit.

212
00:17:19.866 --> 00:17:22.076
Don't tell me.
Don't tell me.
Let me guess.

213
00:17:22.243 --> 00:17:25.121
Mmm, Valentino Couture?

214
00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:27.290
Uh-huh.
Hmm.

215
00:17:27.498 --> 00:17:30.501
It looks so soft.
Your compliment
was sufficient, Luis.

216
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:37.383
Hello, Halberstram.
Nice tie.
How the hell are you?

217
00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:40.678
Allen has mistaken me for this
dickhead, Marcus Halberstram.

218
00:17:40.887 --> 00:17:43.389
It seems logical because
Marcus also works at P&P,

219
00:17:43.556 --> 00:17:45.933
and in fact does
the same exact thing I do.

220
00:17:46.142 --> 00:17:50.021
He also has a penchant
for Valentino suits
and Oliver Peoples glasses.

221
00:17:50.229 --> 00:17:52.023
Marcus and I
even go to the same barber,

222
00:17:52.231 --> 00:17:54.317
although I have
a slightly better haircut.

223
00:17:54.484 --> 00:17:57.737
- How's the Ransom account
going, Marcus?
- It's, uh, all right.

224
00:17:57.904 --> 00:18:00.156
Really? That's interesting.
It's not, uh, not great.

225
00:18:00.323 --> 00:18:02.909
- Oh, well, you know.
- So, how's Cecilia?

226
00:18:03.117 --> 00:18:05.703
- She's a great girl.
- Oh, yeah. I'm very lucky.

227
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.873
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, Allen, congratulations
on the Fisher account.

228
00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.626
- Thank you, Baxter.
- Listen, Paul. Squash.

229
00:18:16.672 --> 00:18:19.717
Call me.
How about Friday?

230
00:18:19.926 --> 00:18:24.222
No can do.
I got an 8:30 res at Dorsia.

231
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:27.809
Great sea urchin ceviche.

232
00:18:27.934 --> 00:18:29.894
Dorsia on Friday night?
How'd he swing that?

233
00:18:30.061 --> 00:18:31.896
I think he's lying.

234
00:18:34.565 --> 00:18:37.735
- Is that a gram?
- New card.

235
00:18:37.902 --> 00:18:40.738
What do you think?

236
00:18:40.905 --> 00:18:43.366
Whoa-ho.
Very nice.

237
00:18:43.574 --> 00:18:47.370
Look at that.
Picked them up from
the printer's yesterday.

238
00:18:47.537 --> 00:18:49.372
Good coloring.
That's bone.

239
00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.999
And the lettering is something
called Silian Rail.

240
00:18:52.208 --> 00:18:55.628
It's very cool, Bateman,
but that's nothing.
Look at this.

241
00:18:55.753 --> 00:18:58.005
That is really nice.

242
00:18:58.214 --> 00:19:02.051
Eggshell with Romalian type.
What do you think?

243
00:19:02.218 --> 00:19:04.971
Nice.

244
00:19:05.138 --> 00:19:09.600
Jesus. That is really super.
How'd a nitwit like you
get so tasteful?

245
00:19:09.767 --> 00:19:12.145
I can't believe that Bryce...

246
00:19:12.311 --> 00:19:15.148
prefers Van Patten's card
to mine.

247
00:19:15.314 --> 00:19:18.109
But wait.
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

248
00:19:19.944 --> 00:19:25.450
Raised lettering,
pale nimbus... white.

249
00:19:25.658 --> 00:19:28.119
Impressive.
Very nice.

250
00:19:28.327 --> 00:19:30.246
Hmm.

251
00:19:30.413 --> 00:19:32.540
Let's see Paul Allen's card.

252
00:19:47.263 --> 00:19:48.973
Look at that subtle
off-white coloring.

253
00:19:49.182 --> 00:19:51.976
The tasteful thickness of it.

254
00:19:52.143 --> 00:19:55.229
Oh, my God.
It even has a watermark.

255
00:20:00.068 --> 00:20:02.528
Is something wrong,
Patrick?

256
00:20:02.695 --> 00:20:04.530
You're sweating.

257
00:20:33.017 --> 00:20:35.686
Hello. Pat Bateman.

258
00:20:35.853 --> 00:20:37.688
You want some, uh, money?

259
00:20:37.897 --> 00:20:39.690
Some food?

260
00:20:42.193 --> 00:20:44.529
- Is this what you need?
- I'm-I'm hungry.

261
00:20:44.737 --> 00:20:46.531
Yeah.
Cold out too, isn't it?

262
00:20:51.494 --> 00:20:54.706
Why don't you get a job?
If you're so hungry,
why don't you get a job?

263
00:20:54.872 --> 00:20:56.708
I lost my job.

264
00:20:56.916 --> 00:20:58.835
Why? You drinking?

265
00:20:59.043 --> 00:21:02.547
Is that why you lost it?
Insider trading?

266
00:21:02.755 --> 00:21:04.841
Just joking.

267
00:21:05.049 --> 00:21:08.052
Listen, what's your name?
Al.

268
00:21:08.261 --> 00:21:10.096
Hmm? Speak up.
Come on.
Al.

269
00:21:10.263 --> 00:21:12.432
Get a goddamn job, Al.

270
00:21:12.598 --> 00:21:15.643
You got a negative attitude.
That's what's stopping you.

271
00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:19.272
You gotta get your act together.
I'll help you.

272
00:21:19.439 --> 00:21:23.151
You are so kind, mister.
You're a kind...
You're a kind man.

273
00:21:23.317 --> 00:21:25.153
It's okay.
I can tell.

274
00:21:25.319 --> 00:21:28.573
Please, you gotta tell me
what to do.
You gotta help me.

275
00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.576
I'm so cold,
I'm hungry.

276
00:21:31.784 --> 00:21:34.245
You know how bad you smell?

277
00:21:34.454 --> 00:21:37.415
You reek of shit.
Do you know that?

278
00:21:37.582 --> 00:21:40.793
Al.

279
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.838
I'm sorry.
It's just that...

280
00:21:44.047 --> 00:21:45.882
I don't know.

281
00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.552
I don't have anything
in common with you.

282
00:21:57.894 --> 00:22:00.438
Oh.
Oh, thank you, mister.
Thank you.

283
00:22:00.646 --> 00:22:03.649
I'm cold out here.

284
00:22:03.816 --> 00:22:05.651
You know what
a fucking loser you are?
What?

285
00:22:31.344 --> 00:22:34.013
What beautiful skin you have,
Mr. Bateman.

286
00:22:34.222 --> 00:22:37.266
So fine,
so smooth.

287
00:22:44.941 --> 00:22:47.276
I have all the characteristics
of a human being...

288
00:22:47.485 --> 00:22:50.947
flesh, blood, skin, hair...

289
00:22:51.155 --> 00:22:54.325
but not a single, clear,
identifiable emotion,

290
00:22:54.492 --> 00:22:57.829
except for greed and disgust.

291
00:22:57.995 --> 00:23:00.540
Something horrible
is happening inside of me,

292
00:23:00.707 --> 00:23:02.542
and I don't know why.

293
00:23:04.168 --> 00:23:07.797
My nightly blood lust
has overflowed into my days.

294
00:23:07.922 --> 00:23:11.551
I feel lethal,
on the verge of frenzy.

295
00:23:11.718 --> 00:23:14.846
I think my mask of sanity
is about to slip.

296
00:23:27.358 --> 00:23:30.194
Hey, McCloy,
what do you say?

297
00:23:30.361 --> 00:23:32.739
Hey, Hamilton.
Have a holly, jolly Christmas.

298
00:23:32.905 --> 00:23:37.035
Is Allen still handling
the Fisher account?
Of course. Who else?

299
00:23:37.201 --> 00:23:40.079
Mistletoe alert.
Merry Xmas, Patrick.

300
00:23:40.246 --> 00:23:42.665
Merry Xmas, Harry.
Merry Christmas.

301
00:23:42.832 --> 00:23:45.001
You're late, honey.
Oh, yes, you are.
I'm not late.

302
00:23:45.209 --> 00:23:48.212
I've been here the entire time.
You just didn't see me.

303
00:23:48.421 --> 00:23:52.341
Say hello to Snowball.
Snowball says,
"Merry Christmas, Patrick."

304
00:23:52.592 --> 00:23:55.887
What is it?
It's a little baby
piggly-wiggly, isn't it?

305
00:23:56.054 --> 00:23:58.389
It's a Vietnamese
potbellied pig.

306
00:23:58.598 --> 00:24:00.850
They make darling pets.
Don't you?

307
00:24:00.975 --> 00:24:03.227
Don't you?

308
00:24:03.436 --> 00:24:06.355
Stop scowling, Patrick.
You're such a grinch.

309
00:24:06.522 --> 00:24:08.649
And what does Mr. Grinch
want for Christmas?

310
00:24:08.816 --> 00:24:10.985
And don't say
breast implants again.

311
00:24:13.529 --> 00:24:16.574
Allen.
Marcus.
Merry Christmas.

312
00:24:16.783 --> 00:24:19.744
How you been?
Workaholic, I suppose?
Haven't seen you in a while.

313
00:24:19.911 --> 00:24:23.873
Hey, Hamilton.
We're goin' to Nell's.
Limo's out front.

314
00:24:24.082 --> 00:24:27.251
We should have dinner.
Maybe you could bring...

315
00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:30.254
Cecilla?
Yes, Cecilla.

316
00:24:30.421 --> 00:24:32.590
Oh, Cecilla would adore it.

317
00:24:32.799 --> 00:24:35.343
Well, then,
let's do it, Marcus.

318
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.303
Great party.
Thanks.

319
00:24:37.512 --> 00:24:39.597
Patrick, why is he
calling you Marcus?

320
00:24:39.806 --> 00:24:42.308
Mistletoe alert.

321
00:24:50.733 --> 00:24:53.152
Marcus Halberstram
for two at 7:00.

322
00:24:55.488 --> 00:24:58.908
No, I want to know, okay?
I came here for
the cilantro crawfish gumbo,

323
00:24:59.117 --> 00:25:02.578
which is, after all,
the only excuse one could have
for being in this restaurant,

324
00:25:02.787 --> 00:25:05.081
which is, by the way,
almost completely empty.

325
00:25:05.289 --> 00:25:08.668
I'm very sorry, sir.
J&B straight,
and a Corona.

326
00:25:08.835 --> 00:25:11.462
Would you like to hear...
Double Absolut martini.

327
00:25:11.671 --> 00:25:13.589
Yes, sir.
Would you like to hear
the specials?

328
00:25:13.756 --> 00:25:16.092
Not if you want
to keep your spleen.

329
00:25:19.679 --> 00:25:23.182
This is a real beehive
of activity, Halberstram.
This place is hot.

330
00:25:23.349 --> 00:25:27.103
Very hot.
Listen, the mud soup
and charcoal arugula...

331
00:25:27.311 --> 00:25:29.147
are outrageous here.

332
00:25:29.355 --> 00:25:31.524
Yeah, well, you're late.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce.

333
00:25:31.691 --> 00:25:34.152
Give me a break.

334
00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:39.449
I see they've omitted
the pork loin with lime Jell-O.
We should've gone to Dorsia.

335
00:25:39.615 --> 00:25:42.201
I could've gotten us
a table.
Nobody goes there anymore.

336
00:25:44.078 --> 00:25:46.956
Is that Ivana Trump?

337
00:25:47.123 --> 00:25:50.918
Oh, geez, Patrick.
I mean, Marcus.
What are you thinking?

338
00:25:51.127 --> 00:25:54.797
Why would Ivana
be at Texarkana?

339
00:25:54.922 --> 00:25:58.885
So, uh,
wasn't Rothchild originally
handling the Fisher account?

340
00:25:59.052 --> 00:26:03.473
How'd you get it?
Well, I could
tell you that, Halberstram,

341
00:26:03.723 --> 00:26:05.892
but then I'd have to
kill you.

342
00:26:12.732 --> 00:26:16.527
I like to dissect girls.
Did you know
I'm utterly insane?

343
00:26:19.572 --> 00:26:21.824
Great tan, Marcus.
I mean, really impressive.

344
00:26:21.991 --> 00:26:23.701
Where do you tan?
Salon.

345
00:26:23.868 --> 00:26:26.037
I've got a tanning bed at home.
You should look into it.

346
00:26:26.245 --> 00:26:29.415
And, uh, Cecilla.

347
00:26:29.582 --> 00:26:31.751
How is she?
Where is she tonight?

348
00:26:31.918 --> 00:26:34.712
Cecilla's, uh...
Well, you know Cecilla.

349
00:26:34.921 --> 00:26:37.423
I think she's having dinner
with, um, Evelyn Williams.

350
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:40.385
Evelyn?
Great ass.

351
00:26:40.593 --> 00:26:44.138
Goes out with that loser
Patrick Bateman.
What a dork.

352
00:26:44.305 --> 00:26:47.392
Another martini, Paul?

353
00:26:53.231 --> 00:26:55.066
You like
Huey Lewis and the News?

354
00:26:55.233 --> 00:26:57.318
Um, they're okay.

355
00:26:59.445 --> 00:27:03.116
They're early work was a little
too new wave for my taste.

356
00:27:03.324 --> 00:27:06.160
But when Sports
came out in '83,

357
00:27:06.327 --> 00:27:09.288
I think they really
came into their own,
commercially and artistically.

358
00:27:12.625 --> 00:27:15.211
The whole album has
a clear, crisp sound,

359
00:27:15.461 --> 00:27:18.005
and a new sheen of
consummate professionalism...

360
00:27:18.172 --> 00:27:21.300
that really gives the songs
a big boost.

361
00:27:30.643 --> 00:27:33.020
He's been compared
to Elvis Costello,

362
00:27:33.229 --> 00:27:37.734
but I think Huey has
a far more bitter,
cynical sense of humor.

363
00:27:37.859 --> 00:27:39.694
Hey, Halberstram?
Yes, Allen?

364
00:27:39.861 --> 00:27:42.613
Why are there copies
of the Style section
all over the place?

365
00:27:42.822 --> 00:27:47.577
Do you...
Do you have a dog?
A little chow or something?

366
00:27:47.744 --> 00:27:50.538
- No, Allen.
- Is that a raincoat?

367
00:27:50.705 --> 00:27:52.874
Yes, it is.

368
00:27:53.082 --> 00:27:55.543
In '87, Huey released this...

369
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.545
Fore, their most
accomplished album.

370
00:27:57.712 --> 00:28:01.299
I think their undisputed
masterpiece is
"Hip To Be Square."

371
00:28:01.507 --> 00:28:04.135
The song's so catchy,
most people probably
don't listen to the lyrics.

372
00:28:04.343 --> 00:28:06.679
But they should,
because it's not just about...

373
00:28:06.846 --> 00:28:09.640
the pleasures of conformity
and the importance of trends.

374
00:28:09.849 --> 00:28:13.936
It's also a personal statement
about the band itself.
Hey, Paul!

375
00:28:19.525 --> 00:28:22.487
Try getting a reservation
at Dorsia now,

376
00:28:22.695 --> 00:28:25.698
you fuckin' stupid bastard!

377
00:28:25.865 --> 00:28:29.660
You fucking bastard!

378
00:29:29.095 --> 00:29:32.557
He was completely naked
and standing up
on the table.

379
00:29:32.765 --> 00:29:35.143
He had no clothes on
whatsoever, and he...

380
00:29:35.309 --> 00:29:37.145
Patrick?
Patrick.

381
00:29:37.311 --> 00:29:39.814
Is that you?

382
00:29:39.981 --> 00:29:43.151
No, Luis, it's not me.
You're mistaken.

383
00:29:43.317 --> 00:29:45.319
This is my very good friend,
Patrick Bateman.

384
00:29:45.486 --> 00:29:49.574
Where are you going?
We're going to Nell's.
Gwendolyn's father is buying it.

385
00:29:49.741 --> 00:29:52.410
Ooh.

386
00:29:53.995 --> 00:29:55.830
Where did you get
that overnight bag?

387
00:29:58.541 --> 00:30:00.376
Jean-Paul Gaultier.

388
00:30:11.721 --> 00:30:13.556
When I get
to Paul Allen's place,

389
00:30:13.723 --> 00:30:15.600
I use the keys
I took from his pocket...

390
00:30:15.767 --> 00:30:17.685
before disposing
of the body.

391
00:30:17.852 --> 00:30:20.897
There is a moment
of sheer panic...

392
00:30:21.064 --> 00:30:25.360
when I realize that Paul's
apartment overlooks the park...

393
00:30:25.526 --> 00:30:28.071
and is obviously
more expensive than mine.

394
00:30:31.491 --> 00:30:34.077
I calm myself
and move into the bedroom,

395
00:30:34.285 --> 00:30:37.246
where I find his suitcase
and start to pack.

396
00:30:37.455 --> 00:30:40.166
It's time for Paul
to take a little trip.

397
00:30:43.169 --> 00:30:45.296
Where do I send the bastard?

398
00:30:45.463 --> 00:30:47.298
Dallas?

399
00:30:47.507 --> 00:30:49.926
Paris? Singapore?

400
00:30:50.134 --> 00:30:53.179
London? I'll send
the asshole to London.

401
00:30:58.351 --> 00:31:01.646
Hi. This is Paul.

402
00:31:01.813 --> 00:31:03.773
I've been called away
to London for a few days.

403
00:31:03.981 --> 00:31:07.151
Meredith, I'll call you
when I get back.
Hasta la vista, baby.

404
00:31:32.885 --> 00:31:34.679
What is it?

405
00:31:34.846 --> 00:31:38.349
Patrick.
Yes, Jean?

406
00:31:38.558 --> 00:31:41.644
There's a Mr. Donald Kimball
here to see you.
Who?

407
00:31:41.853 --> 00:31:44.313
Detective Donald Kimball.

408
00:31:47.525 --> 00:31:49.444
Tell him I'm at lunch.

409
00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:53.990
Patrick, it's only 10:30.
I think he knows you're here.

410
00:31:54.157 --> 00:31:56.409
Send him in, I guess.

411
00:32:03.499 --> 00:32:07.253
Now, John,
you've gotta wear clothes
in proportion to your physique.

412
00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:11.174
There are definite
do's and don'ts, good buddy,
of wearing a bold-striped shirt.

413
00:32:11.424 --> 00:32:13.676
A bold-striped shirt
calls for solid-colored...

414
00:32:13.801 --> 00:32:16.137
or discreetly patterned
suits and ties.

415
00:32:16.345 --> 00:32:19.682
Yes, always tip the stylist
15 percent.

416
00:32:19.807 --> 00:32:23.519
Listen, John, I've gotta go.
T. Boone Pickens just walked in.

417
00:32:23.728 --> 00:32:28.316
Just joking.
No, don't tip the owner
of the salon.

418
00:32:28.483 --> 00:32:30.318
Okay, John? Right.

419
00:32:30.485 --> 00:32:33.571
Got it.
Sorry about that.

420
00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:36.199
No, I'm sorry.
I should've made an appointment.

421
00:32:36.366 --> 00:32:38.201
Was that anything important?

422
00:32:38.368 --> 00:32:41.287
Oh, that?
Just mulling over
business problems,

423
00:32:41.454 --> 00:32:45.750
examining opportunities,
exchanging rumors,
spreading gossip.

424
00:32:45.958 --> 00:32:49.045
Hi.

425
00:32:49.295 --> 00:32:52.090
I'm Donald Kimball.
Hi. Pat Bateman.

426
00:32:52.298 --> 00:32:54.425
Nice to meet you.
Sorry to barge in on you
like this.

427
00:32:54.592 --> 00:32:56.511
I know how busy
you guys can get.

428
00:32:59.305 --> 00:33:03.267
So, what's the, uh,
topic of discussion?

429
00:33:03.476 --> 00:33:05.812
I've been hired
by Meredith Powell...

430
00:33:05.978 --> 00:33:08.981
to investigate the disappearance
of Paul Allen.

431
00:33:10.983 --> 00:33:13.236
I see, yeah.
Paul's disappearance, yeah.

432
00:33:13.403 --> 00:33:15.405
So it's nothing
that official.

433
00:33:15.613 --> 00:33:18.658
- I just have some questions
about Paul Allen and yourself.
- Coffee?

434
00:33:18.866 --> 00:33:20.868
- No, I'm okay.
- Apollinaris?

435
00:33:21.077 --> 00:33:22.912
No, I'm okay.

436
00:33:23.079 --> 00:33:25.540
Can you bring Mr...

437
00:33:25.748 --> 00:33:28.292
Kimball. No, I'm okay.
Mr. Kimball
a bottle of Apollinaris.

438
00:33:28.501 --> 00:33:30.503
It's no problem.

439
00:33:32.922 --> 00:33:35.299
So, what's the topic
of discussion?

440
00:33:35.466 --> 00:33:38.010
The disappearance
of Paul Allen.

441
00:33:38.177 --> 00:33:41.723
Uh-huh, right.
Well, I, um, haven't...

442
00:33:43.725 --> 00:33:46.436
I haven't heard anything about
the disappearance or anything.

443
00:33:46.602 --> 00:33:48.646
Not on page six, at least.

444
00:33:48.855 --> 00:33:52.400
- I think his family
wants this kept quiet.
- Understandable. Lime?

445
00:33:52.608 --> 00:33:56.529
- No, really, I'm okay.
- You sure? I can always
get you a lime.

446
00:33:56.696 --> 00:33:59.657
Just some preliminary
questions that I need
for my own files, okay?

447
00:33:59.824 --> 00:34:01.659
Shoot.

448
00:34:01.868 --> 00:34:04.245
Hold old are you?
Twenty-seven.

449
00:34:04.412 --> 00:34:06.247
Where did you go
to school?
Harvard.

450
00:34:06.414 --> 00:34:08.958
Then Harvard Business School.
Your address?

451
00:34:09.125 --> 00:34:11.252
The American Gardens Building,
West 81st Street.

452
00:34:11.419 --> 00:34:14.881
- Nice. Very nice.
- Thanks.

453
00:34:15.048 --> 00:34:18.634
What can you tell me
about Paul Allen?
I'm at a loss.

454
00:34:18.801 --> 00:34:21.554
He was part of that whole
Yale thing.
"Yale thing"?

455
00:34:21.721 --> 00:34:24.474
- Yeah, Yale thing.
- What do you mean,
"Yale thing"?

456
00:34:24.682 --> 00:34:28.519
Well, I think for one
that he was probably
a closet homosexual...

457
00:34:28.728 --> 00:34:30.521
who did a lot of cocaine.

458
00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:32.732
That "Yale thing."

459
00:34:32.899 --> 00:34:36.903
What kind of man was he,
besides the information
you've just given?

460
00:34:37.111 --> 00:34:39.822
- I hope I'm not being
cross-examined here.
- You feel like that?

461
00:34:39.947 --> 00:34:41.949
No, not really.

462
00:34:44.118 --> 00:34:45.953
Where did Paul hang out?

463
00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.955
Hang out?
Yeah, you know, hang out.

464
00:34:48.122 --> 00:34:52.210
Let me think.
Um, the Newport, Harry's,

465
00:34:52.377 --> 00:34:54.170
Fluties, Indochine,

466
00:34:54.379 --> 00:34:56.214
Nell's, the Cornell Club,

467
00:34:56.422 --> 00:34:58.674
the New York Yacht Club.
He had a yacht?

468
00:34:58.841 --> 00:35:02.678
- No, he just hung out there.
- And where did he
go to school?

469
00:35:02.887 --> 00:35:05.264
Don't you know this?

470
00:35:05.473 --> 00:35:07.350
I just wanted to know
if you know.

471
00:35:11.521 --> 00:35:14.524
Before Yale,
if I remember correctly,
St. Paul's.

472
00:35:14.691 --> 00:35:17.568
Listen, I just...
I just wanna help.

473
00:35:17.735 --> 00:35:20.655
I understand.

474
00:35:23.282 --> 00:35:25.076
Do you have any witnesses
or fingerprints?

475
00:35:25.284 --> 00:35:29.247
Well, there's a message
on his answering machine
that says he went to London.

476
00:35:29.455 --> 00:35:31.916
- Well, maybe he did, huh?
- His girlfriend
doesn't think so.

477
00:35:32.041 --> 00:35:34.043
- But has anyone seen him
in London?
- Actually, yes.

478
00:35:34.293 --> 00:35:37.380
Hmm.
But I've had a hard time
getting actual verification.

479
00:35:37.588 --> 00:35:41.300
A Stephen Hughes said he saw him
at a restaurant there.

480
00:35:41.467 --> 00:35:43.302
But I checked it out,
and what happened is...

481
00:35:43.469 --> 00:35:45.722
he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth
for Paul, so...

482
00:35:45.888 --> 00:35:49.100
- Had his apartment
been burglarized?
- No, actually, it hadn't.

483
00:35:49.267 --> 00:35:52.687
Toiletries were missing,
a suit was gone, so was
some luggage. That's it.

484
00:35:52.854 --> 00:35:55.189
I mean, no one's dealing with
the homicide squad yet
or anything, right?

485
00:35:55.356 --> 00:35:57.734
No, not yet.
As I said, we're not sure.

486
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.111
Basically, no one's seen
or heard anything.

487
00:36:00.319 --> 00:36:03.031
So typical, isn't it?
It's just strange.

488
00:36:03.239 --> 00:36:05.658
One day,
someone's walking around,

489
00:36:05.825 --> 00:36:08.244
going to work, alive,
and then...

490
00:36:08.453 --> 00:36:10.747
Nothing.

491
00:36:10.872 --> 00:36:12.749
People just disappear.

492
00:36:12.915 --> 00:36:16.502
The earth just...
opens up and swallows them.

493
00:36:17.962 --> 00:36:20.882
Eerie.
Really eerie.

494
00:36:26.679 --> 00:36:28.723
Listen, you'll have
to excuse me.

495
00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:33.019
I have a lunch meeting
with Cliff Huxtable
at Four Seasons in 20 minutes.

496
00:36:33.227 --> 00:36:36.981
The Four Seasons?
Isn't that a little far uptown?

497
00:36:37.231 --> 00:36:40.526
I mean, aren't you
gonna be late?
No, there's one down here.

498
00:36:40.693 --> 00:36:43.029
Oh, really?
I didn't know that.
Yeah, it's very good.

499
00:36:43.237 --> 00:36:47.283
Listen, if anything else
occurs to you,
any information...

500
00:36:47.492 --> 00:36:50.036
Absolutely.
I'm 100 percent with you.
Great.

501
00:36:50.203 --> 00:36:53.748
And thanks for your time,
Mr. Bateman.

502
00:36:57.794 --> 00:36:59.629
Bye-bye.
Good-bye.

503
00:37:59.272 --> 00:38:02.358
I haven't seen you around here.
You just haven't been lookin'.

504
00:38:02.525 --> 00:38:06.821
- Would you like to see
my apartment?
- I'm not supposed to.

505
00:38:08.614 --> 00:38:10.450
Do you wanna come
to my apartment or not?

506
00:38:12.994 --> 00:38:17.040
I'm not supposed to,
but I can make an exception.

507
00:38:18.875 --> 00:38:20.710
Do you take a credit card?

508
00:38:20.877 --> 00:38:23.337
I'm joking.

509
00:38:23.588 --> 00:38:25.423
Come on. Get in.

510
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.019
I'd like a girl.
Early 20s.

511
00:38:38.186 --> 00:38:41.481
Blonde,
who does couples.
Couples.

512
00:38:41.647 --> 00:38:45.943
And I really can't stress
blonde enough. Blonde.

513
00:38:47.653 --> 00:38:50.656
I'm Paul.

514
00:38:50.865 --> 00:38:53.951
My name's Paul Allen.
You got that?

515
00:38:54.202 --> 00:38:58.039
You're Christie.
You're to respond
only to Christie.

516
00:38:58.206 --> 00:39:00.041
Is that clear?

517
00:39:10.259 --> 00:39:12.095
That's a very fine chardonnay
you're drinking.

518
00:39:12.261 --> 00:39:14.931
I want you
to clean your vagina.

519
00:39:24.148 --> 00:39:27.110
No. From behind.
Get on your knees.

520
00:39:27.318 --> 00:39:30.029
You have a very nice body.

521
00:39:40.623 --> 00:39:42.625
Mm-hmm?

522
00:39:42.792 --> 00:39:45.378
Thank you. Send her up.

523
00:39:48.131 --> 00:39:51.217
Christie,
get out and dry off.

524
00:39:51.384 --> 00:39:54.095
Choose a robe...
not the Bijan...

525
00:39:54.303 --> 00:39:58.725
and come and meet
me and our guest in
the living room for drinks.

526
00:40:05.648 --> 00:40:07.650
You've arrived.
How lovely.

527
00:40:07.817 --> 00:40:09.652
Let me take your coat.

528
00:40:09.819 --> 00:40:12.488
I'm Paul.
How good of you to come.

529
00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:19.203
Not quite blonde,
are you?

530
00:40:19.412 --> 00:40:21.205
More dirty blonde.

531
00:40:21.414 --> 00:40:23.791
I'm gonna call you
Sabrina.

532
00:40:23.958 --> 00:40:25.918
I'm Paul Allen.

533
00:40:44.896 --> 00:40:47.231
So.

534
00:40:47.398 --> 00:40:49.233
Don't you wanna know
what I do?

535
00:40:53.279 --> 00:40:56.240
No.
No, not really.

536
00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.912
Well, I work on Wall Street...

537
00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.289
for Pierce & Pierce.

538
00:41:03.498 --> 00:41:05.458
Have you heard of it?

539
00:41:14.675 --> 00:41:17.387
You have a really
nice place here, Paul.

540
00:41:17.553 --> 00:41:19.430
How much
did you pay for it?

541
00:41:19.597 --> 00:41:21.557
Well, actually,

542
00:41:21.724 --> 00:41:24.435
that's none of your business,
Christie.

543
00:41:24.644 --> 00:41:28.272
But I can assure you,
it certainly wasn't cheap.

544
00:41:28.481 --> 00:41:30.608
No. No smoking.
Not in here.

545
00:41:33.361 --> 00:41:35.196
Varda truffle?

546
00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.909
I don't want you to get drunk,

547
00:41:40.159 --> 00:41:43.371
but that's a very fine
chardonnay you're not drinking.

548
00:41:50.878 --> 00:41:53.464
Do you like Phil Collins?

549
00:41:53.631 --> 00:41:55.758
I've been a big Genesis fan
ever since the release...

550
00:41:55.925 --> 00:41:59.846
of their 1980 album Duke.

551
00:42:00.012 --> 00:42:04.642
Before that,
I really didn't understand
any of their work.

552
00:42:04.851 --> 00:42:07.729
It was too artsy,
too intellectual.

553
00:42:07.895 --> 00:42:10.523
It was on Duke where...

554
00:42:10.732 --> 00:42:13.568
Phil Collins' presence
became more apparent.

555
00:42:16.404 --> 00:42:21.200
I think Invisible Touch
is the group's
undisputed masterpiece.

556
00:42:24.037 --> 00:42:27.665
It's an epic meditation
on intangibility.

557
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:33.463
At the same time,
it deepens and enriches...

558
00:42:33.629 --> 00:42:36.841
the meaning of
the preceding three albums.

559
00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:39.927
Christie,
take off the robe.

560
00:42:41.929 --> 00:42:44.015
Listen to the brilliant
ensemble playing...

561
00:42:44.265 --> 00:42:46.768
of Banks, Collins
and Rutherford.

562
00:42:46.934 --> 00:42:51.189
You can practically hear
every nuance
of every instrument.

563
00:42:51.397 --> 00:42:53.232
Sabrina, remove your dress.

564
00:42:55.026 --> 00:42:58.363
In terms of
lyrical craftsmanship
and sheer songwriting,

565
00:42:58.571 --> 00:43:01.532
this album hits a new peak
of professionalism.

566
00:43:01.699 --> 00:43:03.993
Sabrina, why don't you,
uh, dance a little.

567
00:43:05.578 --> 00:43:08.039
Take the lyrics to
"Land of Confusion."

568
00:43:08.247 --> 00:43:10.208
In this song,
Phil Collins...

569
00:43:10.375 --> 00:43:14.295
addresses the problems
of abusive political authority.

570
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:20.134
"In Too Deep"
is the most moving pop song
of the 1980s...

571
00:43:20.343 --> 00:43:23.554
about monogamy and commitment.

572
00:43:23.721 --> 00:43:26.891
The song is
extremely uplifting.

573
00:43:27.058 --> 00:43:30.353
Their lyrics are
as positive and affirmative...

574
00:43:30.561 --> 00:43:34.732
as, uh, anything
I've heard in rock.

575
00:43:38.403 --> 00:43:40.321
Christie,
get down on your knees...

576
00:43:40.488 --> 00:43:43.449
so Sabrina can see your asshole.

577
00:43:43.616 --> 00:43:46.202
Phil Collins' solo career...

578
00:43:46.369 --> 00:43:49.080
seems to be more commercial,

579
00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:52.333
and therefore more satisfying
in a narrower way,

580
00:43:52.542 --> 00:43:56.963
especially songs like
"In the Air Tonight"
and "Against All Odds."

581
00:43:59.048 --> 00:44:00.883
Sabrina,
don't just stare at it.
Eat it.

582
00:44:03.428 --> 00:44:05.972
I also think that
Phil Collins works best...

583
00:44:06.139 --> 00:44:09.976
within the confines
of the group
than as a solo artist.

584
00:44:10.184 --> 00:44:13.479
And I stress the word "artist."

585
00:44:17.567 --> 00:44:19.402
This is "Sussudio."

586
00:44:19.569 --> 00:44:22.447
A great, great song.
A personal favorite.

587
00:44:33.499 --> 00:44:38.963
Look at the camera.

588
00:44:54.672 --> 00:44:58.801
Christie, look at the camera.

589
00:45:14.192 --> 00:45:16.027
Don't touch the watch.

590
00:45:38.257 --> 00:45:40.092
Can we go now?

591
00:45:40.259 --> 00:45:42.053
We're not through yet.

592
00:46:00.238 --> 00:46:03.533
If they have a good personality
and they're not great looking,
then who fucking cares?

593
00:46:03.741 --> 00:46:05.535
Let's just say
hypothetically, okay?

594
00:46:05.743 --> 00:46:07.870
What if they have
a good personality?

595
00:46:08.037 --> 00:46:11.040
I know.
I know.

596
00:46:11.249 --> 00:46:13.709
There are no girls
with good personalities.

597
00:46:13.918 --> 00:46:16.629
A good personality consists
of a chick with
a little hard body...

598
00:46:16.754 --> 00:46:18.548
who will satisfy
all sexual demands...

599
00:46:18.756 --> 00:46:20.550
without being too slutty
about things...

600
00:46:20.758 --> 00:46:22.552
and who will essentially keep
her dumb fucking mouth shut.

601
00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:24.595
The only girls
with good personalities...

602
00:46:24.762 --> 00:46:27.890
who are smart or maybe funny
or halfway intelligent
or talented...

603
00:46:28.099 --> 00:46:30.893
though God knows
what the fuck that means...
are ugly chicks.

604
00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:33.229
Absolutely.
And this is because
they have to make up...

605
00:46:33.437 --> 00:46:35.106
for how fucking
unattractive they are.

606
00:46:35.273 --> 00:46:38.401
- Do you know what Ed Gein
said about women?
- Maitre d' at Canal Bar?

607
00:46:38.609 --> 00:46:42.405
- No, serial killer, Wisconsin,
in the 50s.
- And what did Ed say?

608
00:46:42.613 --> 00:46:45.616
"When I see a pretty girl
walking down the street,
I think two things.

609
00:46:45.783 --> 00:46:48.077
"One part of me wants to
take her out and talk to her,

610
00:46:48.286 --> 00:46:50.621
be real nice and sweet
and treat her right."

611
00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:53.124
- And what did the other part
of him think?

612
00:46:53.332 --> 00:46:55.793
What her head would look like
on a stick.

613
00:47:00.631 --> 00:47:03.926
Hi, guys.
I wanna get your opinion
on something.

614
00:47:05.469 --> 00:47:07.722
It's my business card.

615
00:47:07.847 --> 00:47:11.142
I decided to get
a new one too.

616
00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:14.645
Oh, it's...

617
00:47:14.812 --> 00:47:16.647
Very nice, Luis.

618
00:47:18.316 --> 00:47:20.067
Thank you.

619
00:47:33.998 --> 00:47:36.042
Listen, what about dinner?

620
00:47:36.209 --> 00:47:38.961
Is that all you ever have
to contribute, Van Patten?
"What about fucking dinner"?

621
00:47:39.128 --> 00:47:42.048
Cheer up there, Bateman.
What's the matter?
No shiatsu this morning?

622
00:47:42.215 --> 00:47:45.384
Keep touching me like that,
you'll draw back a stump.
Hold on there, little buddy.

623
00:47:45.551 --> 00:47:47.386
Excuse me.

624
00:48:23.881 --> 00:48:27.718
God. Patrick.
Why here?

625
00:48:27.885 --> 00:48:30.388
I've seen you
looking at me.

626
00:48:30.555 --> 00:48:33.683
I've noticed your...

627
00:48:33.891 --> 00:48:36.394
hot body.

628
00:48:36.561 --> 00:48:38.521
Don't be shy.

629
00:48:38.688 --> 00:48:40.731
You can't imagine how long
I've wanted this...

630
00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:43.484
ever since that Christmas party
at Arizona 206.

631
00:48:43.651 --> 00:48:46.821
You know, the one you were
wearing that red-striped
paisley Armani tie.

632
00:48:50.658 --> 00:48:54.287
I want you.
I want you too.

633
00:48:54.453 --> 00:48:56.289
Patrick.
What is it?

634
00:48:56.455 --> 00:48:59.458
Where are you going?

635
00:48:59.625 --> 00:49:02.295
I've gotta return
some video tapes.

636
00:49:09.969 --> 00:49:12.930
Patrick!

637
00:49:36.287 --> 00:49:38.414
Okay, London the...

638
00:49:38.623 --> 00:49:41.292
London, there's, um,
a reservation...
Any Paul Allen?

639
00:49:41.501 --> 00:49:43.794
No.
A reservation, but...
Kimball!

640
00:49:44.003 --> 00:49:46.005
I've been wanting
to talk with you.
Come into my office.

641
00:49:46.214 --> 00:49:48.049
Jean, great jacket.
Matsuta?

642
00:49:48.216 --> 00:49:52.053
Do you remember
where you were the night
of Paul's disappearance,

643
00:49:52.261 --> 00:49:54.096
which was on
the 20th of December?

644
00:49:54.263 --> 00:49:56.182
God.

645
00:49:56.349 --> 00:49:59.352
I guess I was probably
returning video tapes.

646
00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:04.774
I had a date
with a girl named Veronica.

647
00:50:04.982 --> 00:50:07.360
That's not what I've got.
What?

648
00:50:07.485 --> 00:50:09.737
That's not the information
I've received.

649
00:50:09.946 --> 00:50:12.114
Well, I... Wait.

650
00:50:12.323 --> 00:50:15.159
- What information
have you received?
- Let me see.

651
00:50:15.368 --> 00:50:17.995
Well...

652
00:50:18.246 --> 00:50:20.081
You were with...
Well, I could be wrong.

653
00:50:20.248 --> 00:50:23.751
When was the last time
you were with Paul Allen?

654
00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:26.087
We'd gone to a new musical...

655
00:50:26.254 --> 00:50:29.715
called
Oh, Africa, Brave Africa.

656
00:50:29.841 --> 00:50:32.844
It was a laugh riot.
That was about it.

657
00:50:33.052 --> 00:50:36.347
I think we had dinner
at Orso's. No, Peto...
No, Orso's.

658
00:50:36.514 --> 00:50:39.684
I hope I've been informative.
Long day, a bit scattered.

659
00:50:39.851 --> 00:50:41.686
I'm a little spent now too.

660
00:50:41.894 --> 00:50:44.939
But how about lunch
in a week or so...

661
00:50:45.148 --> 00:50:47.275
when I've sorted out
all this information?

662
00:50:47.441 --> 00:50:49.277
Great.
Yes, I'd like that.

663
00:50:49.443 --> 00:50:52.530
And if you could
try and pin down
where you were...

664
00:50:49.735 --> 00:50:49.735
23.976

665
00:50:52.738 --> 00:50:56.284
the night of Paul Allen's
disappearance, it would
make my job a lot easier.

666
00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:15.818
Never. I mean,
I don't really like singers.

667
00:50:56.692 --> 00:50:58.861
Absolutely.
I'm with you on that one.

668
00:51:15.985 --> 00:51:19.322
Not a big music fan, huh?
No, I like music.

669
00:51:19.572 --> 00:51:24.118
Just they're...
Huey's too black sounding
for me.

670
00:51:02.973 --> 00:51:04.808
Huey Lewis and the News.

671
00:51:24.685 --> 00:51:26.645
To each his own.

672
00:51:07.603 --> 00:51:10.773
Great stuff. I just
bought it on my way here.
You heard it?

673
00:51:28.414 --> 00:51:30.541
So, lunch next week?

674
00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:32.543
I'll be there.

675
00:51:41.719 --> 00:51:43.680
Oh!

676
00:51:43.846 --> 00:51:45.723
Oh!

677
00:52:08.287 --> 00:52:11.874
Will you call me
before Easter?
Maybe.

678
00:52:15.628 --> 00:52:17.463
What are you doing tonight?

679
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:20.258
Dinner at, uh, River Cafe.

680
00:52:20.466 --> 00:52:23.678
Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
That's nice.

681
00:52:25.722 --> 00:52:28.433
I never knew you smoked.

682
00:52:28.641 --> 00:52:30.435
You never noticed.

683
00:52:33.813 --> 00:52:35.982
Listen, Patrick.

684
00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:37.900
Can we talk?

685
00:52:44.073 --> 00:52:46.367
You look... marvelous.

686
00:52:48.453 --> 00:52:50.288
There's nothing to say.

687
00:52:50.496 --> 00:52:53.958
You're gonna marry Luis.
Isn't that special?

688
00:52:55.585 --> 00:52:57.420
Patrick?

689
00:53:02.008 --> 00:53:03.843
Yes, Courtney?

690
00:53:06.637 --> 00:53:09.265
If I don't see you
before Easter,

691
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:11.392
have a nice one, okay?

692
00:53:16.522 --> 00:53:18.358
You too.

693
00:53:24.197 --> 00:53:26.616
Patrick?

694
00:53:26.783 --> 00:53:28.576
Yeah?

695
00:53:29.952 --> 00:53:34.499
Nothing.

696
00:54:00.733 --> 00:54:02.527
There is this theory now...
Listen to me.

697
00:54:02.735 --> 00:54:04.570
There is this theory now that if
you can catch the AIDS virus...

698
00:54:04.737 --> 00:54:08.032
by having sex
with someone who's infected,
then you can catch anything.

699
00:54:08.241 --> 00:54:11.494
Alzheimer's,
muscular dystrophy,
hemophilia,

700
00:54:11.703 --> 00:54:14.330
leukemia, diabetes,
dyslexia.

701
00:54:14.455 --> 00:54:17.083
I'm not sure,
but I don't think dyslexia
is a virus.

702
00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:19.460
But who knows?
They don't know that.

703
00:54:19.669 --> 00:54:21.504
Prove it.

704
00:54:33.182 --> 00:54:35.018
Oh, God.
What?

705
00:54:35.184 --> 00:54:38.479
It's a fucking milligram
of sweetener.
I wanna get high off this,

706
00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:40.898
not sprinkle it on
my fucking oatmeal.
It's definitely weak,

707
00:54:41.065 --> 00:54:43.067
but I have a feeling
if we do enough of it,
we'll be okay.

708
00:54:43.276 --> 00:54:46.654
Can you keep it down?
I'm trying to do drugs.

709
00:54:46.863 --> 00:54:49.073
Fuck you!
Calm down.
Let's do it anyway.

710
00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:51.075
That's right.

711
00:54:51.284 --> 00:54:53.161
That is if the faggot
in the next stall
thinks it's okay!

712
00:54:53.327 --> 00:54:55.163
Fuck you!
Hey, fuck you!

713
00:54:57.790 --> 00:55:00.043
Sorry, dude. Steroids.

714
00:55:00.209 --> 00:55:02.462
Okay, let's do it.

715
00:55:22.482 --> 00:55:25.151
Where did Craig go?

716
00:55:25.318 --> 00:55:28.613
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs.
McDermott went
to sign a peace treaty...

717
00:55:28.821 --> 00:55:30.656
between the United States
and Russia.

718
00:55:30.823 --> 00:55:33.493
He's the one behind Glasnost.

719
00:55:33.659 --> 00:55:37.038
- He said he was in
mergers and acquisitions.
- You're not confused, are you?

720
00:55:37.205 --> 00:55:39.165
No, not really.

721
00:55:39.332 --> 00:55:42.085
- Gorbachev is not downstairs.
- Karen's right.

722
00:55:42.251 --> 00:55:44.796
Gorbachev's not downstairs.
He's at Tunnel.

723
00:55:45.004 --> 00:55:46.798
Ask me a question.

724
00:55:48.341 --> 00:55:50.134
So, what do you do?

725
00:55:50.343 --> 00:55:53.680
I'm into, uh,
well, murders
and executions, mostly.

726
00:55:53.888 --> 00:55:57.642
- Do you like it?
- Well, it depends. Why?

727
00:55:57.809 --> 00:56:02.980
Well, most guys I know who work
in mergers and acquisitions
really don't like it.

728
00:56:05.441 --> 00:56:08.945
So, where do you work out?

729
00:56:11.781 --> 00:56:14.200
You think I'm dumb,
don't you?

730
00:56:14.367 --> 00:56:17.328
What?
You think I'm dumb.
You think all models are dumb.

731
00:56:17.537 --> 00:56:20.206
No.
I really don't.

732
00:56:20.373 --> 00:56:23.000
That's okay.
I don't mind.

733
00:56:23.209 --> 00:56:25.044
There's something sweet
about you.

734
00:56:51.654 --> 00:56:53.489
Doin' the crossword?

735
00:56:58.703 --> 00:57:00.872
You need any help?

736
00:57:11.090 --> 00:57:13.718
- Jean?
- Yes, Patrick?

737
00:57:13.926 --> 00:57:17.096
Would you like to accompany me
to dinner?

738
00:57:17.263 --> 00:57:20.016
That is,
if you're not doing anything.

739
00:57:20.183 --> 00:57:22.810
Um, no. No,
I don't have any plans.

740
00:57:25.229 --> 00:57:27.023
Well,

741
00:57:29.359 --> 00:57:31.319
isn't this a coincidence?

742
00:57:31.527 --> 00:57:33.738
Listen, where should we go?
Anywhere you want.

743
00:57:33.905 --> 00:57:36.741
Let's not think about
what I want. How about
anywhere you want?

744
00:57:38.826 --> 00:57:41.371
I don't know, Patrick.
I can't make this decision.

745
00:57:41.537 --> 00:57:45.166
Come on.
Where do you wanna go?

746
00:57:45.291 --> 00:57:50.046
Anywhere you want,
just say it.
I can get us in anywhere.

747
00:57:50.254 --> 00:57:52.090
What about...

748
00:58:00.348 --> 00:58:02.141
Dorsia?

749
00:58:08.731 --> 00:58:10.942
So,

750
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:13.528
Dorsia is where
Jean wants to go.

751
00:58:13.736 --> 00:58:17.281
Well, I don't know.
We'll go wherever you wanna go.

752
00:58:17.407 --> 00:58:19.158
Dorsia is fine.

753
00:58:25.665 --> 00:58:27.500
Dorsia. Yes?

754
00:58:27.667 --> 00:58:31.713
Yeah, can you take two tonight
at, oh, let's say 9:00?
We're totally booked.

755
00:58:31.921 --> 00:58:33.715
Really? That's great.

756
00:58:33.923 --> 00:58:37.343
No, I said
we are totally booked.
Two at 9:00? Perfect.

757
00:58:37.552 --> 00:58:39.512
See ya then.

758
00:58:42.265 --> 00:58:44.475
Yeah?

759
00:58:44.684 --> 00:58:47.979
You're... dressed okay.

760
00:58:48.146 --> 00:58:52.275
- You didn't give a name.
- They know me.

761
00:58:53.568 --> 00:58:57.113
Why don't you meet me
at my place at 7:00...

762
00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.574
for drinks.

763
00:58:59.741 --> 00:59:01.576
And Jean,

764
00:59:01.743 --> 00:59:03.661
you'll wanna change
before we go out.

765
00:59:12.211 --> 00:59:14.172
Patrick, it's so elegant.

766
00:59:14.338 --> 00:59:16.257
What a wonderful view.

767
00:59:16.424 --> 00:59:18.760
Jean,

768
00:59:18.968 --> 00:59:20.803
sorbet?

769
00:59:22.555 --> 00:59:24.724
Thanks, Patrick.
I'd love some.

770
00:59:30.897 --> 00:59:34.567
Do you want a bite?
I'm on a diet.
But thank you.

771
00:59:34.734 --> 00:59:38.071
You don't need
to lose any weight.
You're kidding, right?

772
00:59:38.237 --> 00:59:40.239
You look great.
Very fit.

773
00:59:41.657 --> 00:59:44.660
You can always be thinner,
look better.

774
00:59:44.869 --> 00:59:49.248
Well, maybe we shouldn't
go out to dinner. I don't
wanna ruin your willpower.

775
00:59:49.374 --> 00:59:52.043
No, it's all right.

776
00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:55.546
I'm not very good
at controlling it anyway.

777
00:59:58.299 --> 01:00:00.134
So listen.

778
01:00:00.301 --> 01:00:03.304
What do you really
wanna do with your life?

779
01:00:03.471 --> 01:00:05.598
Just briefly, summarize.

780
01:00:05.765 --> 01:00:08.518
And don't tell me
you enjoy working
with children, okay?

781
01:00:08.685 --> 01:00:12.939
Well, I'd like to travel
and maybe go back to school,

782
01:00:13.147 --> 01:00:16.025
but I don't really know.

783
01:00:16.192 --> 01:00:20.405
I'm at a point in my life
where there seems to be
so many possibilities,

784
01:00:20.655 --> 01:00:23.991
but I'm... I don't know...
I'm just so unsure.

785
01:00:27.578 --> 01:00:30.206
Do you have a boyfriend?

786
01:00:30.373 --> 01:00:34.001
No, not really.
Interesting.

787
01:00:34.168 --> 01:00:37.755
Are you seeing anyone?
I mean, seriously?

788
01:00:37.922 --> 01:00:40.133
Maybe.

789
01:00:40.299 --> 01:00:43.302
I don't know.
Not really.

790
01:00:46.639 --> 01:00:48.433
Jean,

791
01:00:48.641 --> 01:00:51.144
do you feel... fulfilled?

792
01:00:51.310 --> 01:00:53.813
I mean, in your life?

793
01:00:54.063 --> 01:00:56.941
I guess I do. For a long time
I was too focused on my work.

794
01:00:57.108 --> 01:01:02.113
But now I've really begun
to think about changing myself,
you know,

795
01:01:02.321 --> 01:01:04.741
developing and growing.

796
01:01:04.907 --> 01:01:07.994
Growing.
I'm glad you said that.

797
01:01:10.371 --> 01:01:14.667
Did you know that, uh,
Ted Bundy's first dog,

798
01:01:14.876 --> 01:01:17.920
a collie,
was named Lassie?

799
01:01:18.087 --> 01:01:21.382
Had you heard this?
Who's Ted Bundy?

800
01:01:23.343 --> 01:01:25.636
Forget it.

801
01:01:25.845 --> 01:01:28.431
What's that?

802
01:01:28.598 --> 01:01:33.436
Duct tape.
I need it for, uh,
taping something.

803
01:01:38.816 --> 01:01:41.194
Patrick,

804
01:01:41.361 --> 01:01:44.072
have you ever wanted to...
make someone happy?

805
01:01:44.238 --> 01:01:46.532
What? No!
Put it in the carton.

806
01:01:49.077 --> 01:01:51.204
Sorry.

807
01:01:51.371 --> 01:01:52.997
Jean?

808
01:01:55.166 --> 01:01:59.629
What?
Uh, make someone happy?

809
01:02:01.047 --> 01:02:03.341
Have you ever wanted to?

810
01:02:05.802 --> 01:02:08.179
I'm looking for, uh,

811
01:02:12.141 --> 01:02:15.269
I guess you could say
I just wanna have
a meaningful relationship...

812
01:02:15.436 --> 01:02:19.148
with someone special.
Hmm.

813
01:02:26.906 --> 01:02:30.201
Patrick? Patrick?
I know you're there.

814
01:02:30.326 --> 01:02:32.370
Pick up the phone,
you bad boy.

815
01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:36.624
What are you up to tonight?
It's me. Don't try to hide.

816
01:02:36.791 --> 01:02:40.878
I hope you're not with some
little number you picked up
because you're my Mr. Bateman.

817
01:02:41.087 --> 01:02:43.589
My boy next door.

818
01:02:43.756 --> 01:02:46.092
Anyway, you never called me
and you said you would,

819
01:02:46.259 --> 01:02:48.720
and I'll leave
a message for Jean
about this, too, to remind you,

820
01:02:48.886 --> 01:02:51.139
but we're having dinner
with Melania and Taylor.

821
01:02:51.305 --> 01:02:53.516
You know Melania.
She went to Sweet Briar.

822
01:02:53.725 --> 01:02:55.810
And we're meeting
at the Cornell Club,

823
01:02:55.977 --> 01:02:57.854
so I'll call you
tomorrow morning, honey.

824
01:02:58.062 --> 01:03:00.356
Oops. Sorry.
I know you hate that.

825
01:03:00.565 --> 01:03:05.945
Bye, Patrick.
Bye, Mr. Big Time C.E.O.
Bye-bye.

826
01:03:09.365 --> 01:03:12.201
Was that Evelyn?

827
01:03:15.163 --> 01:03:17.498
Are you still seeing her?

828
01:03:21.711 --> 01:03:24.881
I'm sorry.
I have no right to ask that.

829
01:03:29.802 --> 01:03:32.180
Do you want me to go?

830
01:03:32.305 --> 01:03:34.140
Yeah.

831
01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:38.936
I don't think
I can control myself.

832
01:03:41.314 --> 01:03:45.985
I know. I should go.
I know I have a tendency to get
involved with unavailable men.

833
01:03:48.654 --> 01:03:50.448
I mean,

834
01:03:51.866 --> 01:03:54.452
do you want me to go?

835
01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:57.538
I think if you stay,

836
01:03:57.705 --> 01:04:00.291
something bad will happen.

837
01:04:01.709 --> 01:04:03.503
I think I might hurt you.

838
01:04:05.088 --> 01:04:07.340
You don't wanna get hurt,
do you?

839
01:04:07.548 --> 01:04:09.717
No. No, I guess not.

840
01:04:11.177 --> 01:04:13.721
I don't wanna get bruised.

841
01:04:15.765 --> 01:04:18.559
You're right.
I should go.

842
01:04:24.357 --> 01:04:29.153
Oh. Don't forget you have a
lunch date tomorrow with Donald
Kimball at Smith and Wolenski's.

843
01:04:30.363 --> 01:04:32.615
Thanks.

844
01:04:32.824 --> 01:04:34.992
It slipped my mind completely.

845
01:04:54.178 --> 01:04:58.099
So, the night
he disappeared...

846
01:04:58.266 --> 01:05:00.893
any new thoughts
about what you did?

847
01:05:02.979 --> 01:05:06.357
Not sure.
Um, I had a shower...

848
01:05:06.566 --> 01:05:08.359
and some sorbet?

849
01:05:08.568 --> 01:05:10.486
I think you're getting
your dates mixed up.

850
01:05:10.653 --> 01:05:12.488
But how?

851
01:05:12.697 --> 01:05:15.658
Where do you place...
Paul that night?

852
01:05:15.825 --> 01:05:19.162
According to his date book,
and this was verified
by his secretary,

853
01:05:19.287 --> 01:05:22.123
he had dinner
with Marcus Halberstram.

854
01:05:22.331 --> 01:05:24.459
And?
I questioned him.

855
01:05:24.625 --> 01:05:28.755
- Marcus?
- Yes, and he denies it, though,
at first, he couldn't be sure.

856
01:05:28.921 --> 01:05:31.758
But he denied it.
Yes.

857
01:05:33.092 --> 01:05:35.094
Well, does Marcus
have an alibi?

858
01:05:35.261 --> 01:05:38.639
Yes.
He does?
You're sure?

859
01:05:38.848 --> 01:05:40.683
I checked it out.
It's clean.

860
01:05:44.854 --> 01:05:48.191
Now, where were you?

861
01:05:48.358 --> 01:05:50.318
Where was Marcus?

862
01:05:50.568 --> 01:05:52.570
He wasn't with Paul Allen.

863
01:05:52.779 --> 01:05:54.822
Who was he with?
He was...

864
01:05:55.031 --> 01:05:57.408
at Atlantis... with...

865
01:05:57.575 --> 01:06:01.537
Craig McDermott,
Frederick Dibble,
Harry Newman, George Butner...

866
01:06:01.704 --> 01:06:04.165
and... you.

867
01:06:08.461 --> 01:06:10.254
Oh, right, yeah.
Of course.

868
01:06:10.463 --> 01:06:14.509
We had wanted
Paul Allen to come,

869
01:06:14.717 --> 01:06:16.761
but he had made plans.

870
01:06:16.969 --> 01:06:20.765
And I guess I had dinner
with Victoria
the following night.

871
01:06:20.973 --> 01:06:23.226
Personally, I think the guy
went a little nutso.

872
01:06:23.393 --> 01:06:28.189
Split town for a while.
Maybe he did go to London,
sightseeing, drinking, whatever.

873
01:06:28.356 --> 01:06:32.443
Anyway, I'm pretty sure
he'll turn up sooner or later.
I mean, to think...

874
01:06:32.652 --> 01:06:37.824
that one of his friends killed
him for no reason whatsoever
would be too ridiculous.

875
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:40.201
Isn't that right, Patrick?

876
01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:03.516
Christie. Christie.

877
01:07:03.683 --> 01:07:07.353
I'm not so sure about this.
I had to go to Emergency
after last time.

878
01:07:07.562 --> 01:07:10.231
This won't be anything
like last time. I promise.

879
01:07:10.356 --> 01:07:13.067
I don't think so.

880
01:07:13.234 --> 01:07:16.404
Just come in the limo
and talk to me for a minute.

881
01:07:16.612 --> 01:07:18.448
The driver's here.
You'll be safe.

882
01:07:37.342 --> 01:07:39.635
Nothing like last time.
Promise.

883
01:07:39.802 --> 01:07:41.637
All right.

884
01:07:41.804 --> 01:07:45.016
So, you're looking great.
How have you been?

885
01:07:45.183 --> 01:07:48.895
Well, I actually might need
surgery after last time.
Really?

886
01:07:49.062 --> 01:07:53.066
My friend told me
I should maybe
even get a lawyer.

887
01:07:53.232 --> 01:07:55.818
Lawyers are so complicated.

888
01:07:55.985 --> 01:07:58.446
Don't do that.

889
01:07:58.654 --> 01:08:00.490
Here's a check.

890
01:08:48.329 --> 01:08:52.083
Uh-uh. Half now,
half later.

891
01:08:57.422 --> 01:09:00.842
Okay, your name is Christie.

892
01:09:01.050 --> 01:09:03.553
We're meeting a friend
of mine, Elizabeth.

893
01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:08.057
She'll be joining us
in my new apartment shortly.

894
01:09:08.266 --> 01:09:11.602
You'll like her.
She's a very nice girl.

895
01:09:17.775 --> 01:09:21.279
You look really familiar.
Did you go to Dalton?

896
01:09:23.823 --> 01:09:26.451
I think I met you
at Surf Bar, didn't I?
With Spicey?

897
01:09:26.659 --> 01:09:29.746
Well, maybe not with Spicey,
but definitely at Surf Bar.
You know, Surf Bar.

898
01:09:29.912 --> 01:09:31.956
Anyway, Surf Bar sucks now.
It's terrible.

899
01:09:32.123 --> 01:09:37.128
Went to a birthday party there
for Malcolm Forbes.
Oh, my God, please.

900
01:09:37.336 --> 01:09:39.797
This is nicer
than your other apartment.

901
01:09:42.133 --> 01:09:44.093
Oh, it's not
that nice.

902
01:09:48.890 --> 01:09:52.477
Where did you two meet?
Oh, God.
We met at...

903
01:09:52.685 --> 01:09:56.981
oh, God, at the Kentucky Derby
in '85, or '86.

904
01:09:57.148 --> 01:10:00.360
You were hanging out
with that bimbo Allison Poole.
Hot number.

905
01:10:00.568 --> 01:10:02.737
What do you mean?
She was a hot number.

906
01:10:02.904 --> 01:10:07.408
If you had a platinum card,
she'd give you a blow job. This
girl worked in a tanning salon.

907
01:10:07.575 --> 01:10:10.036
What do you do?

908
01:10:10.203 --> 01:10:13.998
She's my... cousin.

909
01:10:14.207 --> 01:10:18.002
Uh-huh.
She's from... France.

910
01:10:18.211 --> 01:10:21.381
Where's your phone?
I've gotta call Harley.

911
01:10:24.967 --> 01:10:28.554
Where do you summer,
South Hampton?

912
01:10:29.847 --> 01:10:32.892
- No.
- Oh, God, it's his machine.

913
01:10:33.059 --> 01:10:37.021
It's 3:00 in the morning.
He's a goddamn drug dealer.
These are his peak hours.

914
01:10:37.188 --> 01:10:39.148
Don't tell him you're here.
Why would I?

915
01:10:39.357 --> 01:10:41.192
This tastes weird.

916
01:10:41.359 --> 01:10:45.488
Harley, it's me.
I need your services.
Translate that however you want.

917
01:10:45.697 --> 01:10:49.367
- I'm at...
- Paul Allen's.

918
01:10:49.575 --> 01:10:51.703
Who?
Paul Allen's.

919
01:10:51.911 --> 01:10:55.748
I want the number, idiot.
Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's
and I'll try you again later.

920
01:10:55.915 --> 01:10:59.585
And if I don't see you at Canal
Bar tomorrow night I'm gonna
sic my hairdresser on you.

921
01:10:59.752 --> 01:11:01.587
Did you know that guy
who disappeared?

922
01:11:01.796 --> 01:11:04.590
Didn't he work
at Pierce & Pierce?
Was he a friend of yours?

923
01:11:04.757 --> 01:11:06.592
No.

924
01:11:06.759 --> 01:11:09.554
Do you have any coke?
Or Halcyon?

925
01:11:09.721 --> 01:11:12.640
I would take a Halcyon.
Listen.

926
01:11:14.434 --> 01:11:16.394
I would just like to see...

927
01:11:16.602 --> 01:11:18.938
the two of you...
get it on.

928
01:11:19.105 --> 01:11:22.233
What's wrong with that?

929
01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.527
It's totally disease free.

930
01:11:26.529 --> 01:11:29.490
Patrick, you're a lunatic.
Come on.

931
01:11:29.657 --> 01:11:31.868
Don't you find Christie
attractive?

932
01:11:32.035 --> 01:11:35.705
Let's not get lewd.
I'm in no mood
for a lewd conversation.

933
01:11:35.872 --> 01:11:38.082
Come on.

934
01:11:38.291 --> 01:11:41.586
I think it'd be a turn-on.
Does he do this
all the time?

935
01:11:44.505 --> 01:11:47.091
Christie,
you're not drinking your wine.

936
01:11:48.676 --> 01:11:50.970
Are you telling me
you've never gotten it on
with a girl?

937
01:11:51.137 --> 01:11:54.182
No. I'm not a lesbian.

938
01:11:54.349 --> 01:11:57.101
Why would you think
I would be into that?

939
01:11:57.310 --> 01:11:59.395
Well, you went to
Sarah Lawrence for one thing.

940
01:11:59.604 --> 01:12:04.108
Those are
Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick.
You're making me feel weird.

941
01:12:08.821 --> 01:12:10.656
Did you know...

942
01:12:10.823 --> 01:12:14.202
that Whitney Houston's
debut LP...

943
01:12:14.327 --> 01:12:17.205
called simply
Whitney Houston...

944
01:12:17.413 --> 01:12:20.041
had four number-one
singles on it?

945
01:12:21.667 --> 01:12:23.628
Did you know that,
Christie?

946
01:12:23.836 --> 01:12:27.131
You actually listen
to Whitney Houston?

947
01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:29.967
You own
a Whitney Houston CD?

948
01:12:31.511 --> 01:12:34.639
More than one?

949
01:12:34.847 --> 01:12:38.184
It's hard to choose
a favorite among
so many great tracks.

950
01:12:40.353 --> 01:12:45.066
But the "Greatest Love Of All"
is one of the best,
most powerful songs...

951
01:12:45.233 --> 01:12:47.318
ever written...

952
01:12:47.527 --> 01:12:49.320
about self-preservation...

953
01:12:49.529 --> 01:12:51.614
and dignity.

954
01:12:51.781 --> 01:12:55.243
Its universal message
crosses all boundaries...

955
01:12:55.368 --> 01:12:57.495
and instills one...

956
01:12:57.704 --> 01:13:01.207
with the hope
that it's not too late...

957
01:13:01.374 --> 01:13:03.584
to better ourselves.

958
01:13:03.835 --> 01:13:07.088
Since, Elizabeth,

959
01:13:07.255 --> 01:13:12.093
it's impossible
in this world we live in
to empathize with others,

960
01:13:12.301 --> 01:13:15.763
we can always empathize
with ourselves.

961
01:13:15.930 --> 01:13:20.059
It's an important message.
Crucial, really.

962
01:14:35.885 --> 01:14:38.221
Not the face!

963
01:14:38.346 --> 01:14:42.308
You bitch,
not the fucking face,
you piece of bitch trash!

964
01:15:39.866 --> 01:15:42.869
Aaah!

965
01:16:11.064 --> 01:16:13.691
I want a firm commitment.

966
01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:17.362
I think, um, Evelyn,
that, uh, we've lost touch.

967
01:16:17.570 --> 01:16:19.322
Why? What's wrong?

968
01:16:22.909 --> 01:16:24.869
My need to engage
in homicidal behavior...

969
01:16:25.036 --> 01:16:27.705
on a massive scale
cannot be corrected,

970
01:16:27.914 --> 01:16:30.833
but I have no other way
to fulfill my needs.

971
01:16:32.418 --> 01:16:35.213
We need to talk.
Talk about what, Patrick?

972
01:16:35.421 --> 01:16:37.340
It's over, Evelyn.

973
01:16:37.548 --> 01:16:39.926
It's all over.

974
01:16:40.093 --> 01:16:43.262
Touchy, touchy.
I'm sorry I brought up
the wedding.

975
01:16:43.471 --> 01:16:46.891
Let's just avoid the issue,
all right? Now,
are we having coffee?

976
01:16:47.058 --> 01:16:51.729
I'm fucking serious.
It's fucking over, us.
This is no joke.

977
01:16:51.938 --> 01:16:54.732
Uh, I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

978
01:16:54.941 --> 01:17:00.071
But your friends are my friends
and my friends are your friends.

979
01:17:00.279 --> 01:17:03.449
I really don't think
it would work. You have
a little something...

980
01:17:03.616 --> 01:17:08.913
I know that your friends
are my friends, and, uh...
and I've thought about that.

981
01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:12.041
You can have 'em.

982
01:17:12.208 --> 01:17:15.586
You're really serious,
aren't you?
Yes, I am.

983
01:17:18.798 --> 01:17:22.844
- What about the past?
Our past?
- We never really shared one.

984
01:17:23.011 --> 01:17:24.971
You're inhuman.
No.

985
01:17:25.138 --> 01:17:28.182
I'm in touch with humanity.

986
01:17:28.349 --> 01:17:32.687
Evelyn, I'm, uh, sorry.
I just, uh...

987
01:17:32.895 --> 01:17:34.856
You're not terribly
important to me.

988
01:17:35.023 --> 01:17:37.608
Oh, no!

989
01:17:37.775 --> 01:17:39.944
No. No, Patrick.

990
01:17:40.111 --> 01:17:44.574
I know my behavior can be...
erratic sometimes.

991
01:17:46.034 --> 01:17:49.037
What do you want me to do?
What is it that you want?

992
01:17:49.203 --> 01:17:52.457
If you really wanna do something
for me, then stop making
this scene right now.

993
01:17:52.665 --> 01:17:55.460
Oh, God, I can't believe this.

994
01:17:55.626 --> 01:17:58.004
I'm leaving.
I've assessed the situation,
and I'm going.

995
01:17:58.171 --> 01:18:01.382
Where are you going?
I'm just leaving.

996
01:18:01.632 --> 01:18:03.593
But where?

997
01:18:04.844 --> 01:18:06.971
I have to return
some videotapes.

998
01:18:37.877 --> 01:18:39.629
Here, kitty, kitty.

999
01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:58.022
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

1000
01:18:58.231 --> 01:19:00.149
Stop that.

1001
01:19:42.066 --> 01:19:44.318
Drop the weapon!
Drop it now!

1002
01:19:44.527 --> 01:19:46.446
Get on the ground!
Put your...

1003
01:20:29.655 --> 01:20:31.991
Burning the midnight oil,
Mr. Smith?

1004
01:20:32.158 --> 01:20:34.452
Hey, now don't forget
to sign in.

1005
01:22:03.583 --> 01:22:06.711
Howard, it's Bateman.
Patrick Bateman.

1006
01:22:06.878 --> 01:22:09.714
You're my lawyer,
so I think you should know
I've killed a lot of people.

1007
01:22:09.922 --> 01:22:12.633
Some escort girls
in an apartment uptown,

1008
01:22:12.842 --> 01:22:15.970
uh, some homeless people,
maybe five or ten,

1009
01:22:16.095 --> 01:22:18.389
an N.Y.U. girl I met
in Central Park.

1010
01:22:18.556 --> 01:22:20.725
I left her at a parking lot
behind some doughnut shop.

1011
01:22:20.892 --> 01:22:23.895
I killed Bethany,
my old girlfriend,
with a nail gun.

1012
01:22:24.103 --> 01:22:28.441
And-And-And then some man,
s-s-some old faggot
with a dog.

1013
01:22:28.649 --> 01:22:30.693
Last week, I, uh...

1014
01:22:30.943 --> 01:22:34.364
I killed another girl
with a chain saw.

1015
01:22:37.241 --> 01:22:40.411
I had to.
She almost got away.

1016
01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:42.413
And...

1017
01:22:42.622 --> 01:22:47.627
Someone else there.
I can't remember,
maybe a model... She's dead too.

1018
01:22:47.794 --> 01:22:50.296
And, uh, Paul Allen.

1019
01:22:50.421 --> 01:22:54.133
I killed Paul Allen
with an ax in the face.

1020
01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:58.596
His body is dissolving
in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen.

1021
01:22:58.805 --> 01:23:03.351
I don't wanna leave anything
out here. I guess I've killed
maybe... 20 people.

1022
01:23:03.559 --> 01:23:06.521
Maybe 40!

1023
01:23:06.729 --> 01:23:09.982
I have tapes of a lot of it.

1024
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:12.694
Some of the girls
have seen the tapes.

1025
01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:15.446
I even, um,

1026
01:23:22.578 --> 01:23:24.956
I ate some
of their brains...

1027
01:23:25.123 --> 01:23:28.751
and I tried to
cook a little.

1028
01:23:31.212 --> 01:23:34.340
Tonight, I, uh...

1029
01:23:34.590 --> 01:23:38.428
I just had to kill
a lot of people!

1030
01:23:38.594 --> 01:23:40.596
And, um,

1031
01:23:43.808 --> 01:23:48.813
I'm not sure I'm gonna
get away with it... this time.

1032
01:23:51.816 --> 01:23:54.736
So, uh... I mean,

1033
01:23:54.902 --> 01:23:58.281
I guess...

1034
01:23:58.406 --> 01:24:00.992
I'm a pretty, uh...

1035
01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:04.996
I mean, I guess
I'm a pretty sick guy.

1036
01:24:05.204 --> 01:24:07.665
So,

1037
01:24:09.375 --> 01:24:12.211
if you get back tomorrow,

1038
01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:14.547
I may show up at Harry's Bar.

1039
01:24:14.756 --> 01:24:17.717
So, you know,

1040
01:24:17.925 --> 01:24:19.969
keep your eyes open.

1041
01:24:20.178 --> 01:24:23.139
Okay.

1042
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:29.145
Oh!

1043
01:26:39.525 --> 01:26:41.778
Are you my 2:00?

1044
01:26:41.903 --> 01:26:45.740
No.
Can I help you?

1045
01:26:46.991 --> 01:26:50.953
I'm looking for...
Paul Allen's place.

1046
01:26:52.205 --> 01:26:55.875
Doesn't he... live here?
No, he doesn't.

1047
01:26:56.084 --> 01:26:58.920
You sure?

1048
01:26:59.128 --> 01:27:01.339
You saw the ad
in the Times?

1049
01:27:01.547 --> 01:27:04.384
No. Yeah.
I mean, yeah.

1050
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:08.012
In the Times.
There was no ad
in the Times.

1051
01:27:09.389 --> 01:27:11.557
I think you should
go now.

1052
01:27:11.724 --> 01:27:13.559
But I think...

1053
01:27:15.311 --> 01:27:17.438
I wanna know
what happened here.

1054
01:27:17.647 --> 01:27:20.733
Don't make any trouble,
please.

1055
01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:23.027
I suggest you go.

1056
01:27:34.956 --> 01:27:36.791
Don't come back.

1057
01:27:36.958 --> 01:27:39.002
I won't.

1058
01:27:39.210 --> 01:27:41.170
Don't worry.

1059
01:28:08.322 --> 01:28:12.368
Patrick Bateman's office.

1060
01:28:12.618 --> 01:28:16.247
Jean? I need help.
Patrick, is that you?

1061
01:28:17.373 --> 01:28:19.792
Jean, I'm not...

1062
01:28:19.959 --> 01:28:24.380
Craig McDermott called. Wants
to meet you, David Van Patten
and Tim Bryce at Harry's.

1063
01:28:24.589 --> 01:28:28.384
Oh, God.
What did you say,
you dumb bitch?

1064
01:28:28.551 --> 01:28:32.305
Patrick, I can't hear you.
What am I doing?

1065
01:28:32.472 --> 01:28:34.349
Where are you, Patrick?
What's wrong?

1066
01:28:36.642 --> 01:28:41.189
I don't think
I'm gonna make it, Jean,
to the, uh,

1067
01:28:41.356 --> 01:28:43.191
office this afternoon.

1068
01:28:43.358 --> 01:28:45.193
Why?

1069
01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:49.989
Just say no!
What is it, Patrick?
Are you all right?

1070
01:28:50.198 --> 01:28:54.243
Stop sounding
so fucking sad.

1071
01:28:54.494 --> 01:28:56.287
Jesus!

1072
01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:18.036
That's a table for three.
Bateman, you're looking
wild-eyed. Rough day?

1073
01:30:18.202 --> 01:30:20.955
Hey, look.
Bryce is back and
he's drinking mineral water.

1074
01:30:21.164 --> 01:30:24.125
He's a changed man,
except for he still can't
a reservation to save his life.

1075
01:30:24.292 --> 01:30:26.336
Why don't you just try
150 Wooster?

1076
01:30:26.586 --> 01:30:30.006
I'm not going anywhere
unless we have a reservation.

1077
01:30:30.173 --> 01:30:33.885
Le Cirque, Flamingo East,
Oyster Bar. Come on, faggots.
Let's get a "res."

1078
01:30:34.052 --> 01:30:37.722
Keep your shirt on.
Maybe lose the suspenders.

1079
01:30:37.889 --> 01:30:39.807
Need a reservation
for 8:30.

1080
01:30:39.974 --> 01:30:42.393
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Right back.

1081
01:30:42.602 --> 01:30:44.896
10:00 would not be
any good. No.

1082
01:30:45.063 --> 01:30:48.274
Just fucking call them.
Give me the phone. I'll do it.
I'll call you back.

1083
01:30:48.524 --> 01:30:51.819
Face it. The Japanese
will own most of this country
by the end of the '90s.

1084
01:30:51.986 --> 01:30:54.864
Shut up, Carnes.
They will not.

1085
01:30:56.407 --> 01:30:59.994
So, uh, Harold,
did you get my message?

1086
01:31:00.203 --> 01:31:04.290
Jesus, yes.
That was hilarious.
That was you, wasn't it?

1087
01:31:04.457 --> 01:31:08.127
Yeah, naturally.
Bateman killing Allen
and the escort girls.

1088
01:31:08.294 --> 01:31:10.129
That's fabulous.
That's rich.
What exactly do you mean?

1089
01:31:10.296 --> 01:31:14.634
The message you left. By
the way, Davis, how's Cynthia?
You're still seeing her, right?

1090
01:31:14.842 --> 01:31:16.803
W-Wait, Harold.
What do you mean?

1091
01:31:16.969 --> 01:31:20.390
Excuse me. Nothing.
It's good to see you.

1092
01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:23.101
Is that Edward Towers?

1093
01:31:23.226 --> 01:31:25.019
Carnes, wait. Uh...

1094
01:31:25.228 --> 01:31:30.900
Davis, I'm not one
to bad-mouth anyone.
Your joke was amusing.

1095
01:31:31.109 --> 01:31:34.946
But come on, man.
You had one fatal flaw:

1096
01:31:35.113 --> 01:31:37.073
Bateman is such a dork.

1097
01:31:37.281 --> 01:31:40.785
Such a boring,
spineless lightweight.

1098
01:31:40.993 --> 01:31:44.747
Now, if you said Bryce
or McDermott. Otherwise,
it was amusing.

1099
01:31:44.914 --> 01:31:47.417
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I really must be going.

1100
01:31:47.625 --> 01:31:50.962
Wait. Uh... Stop.

1101
01:31:52.338 --> 01:31:54.841
I did it, Carnes.

1102
01:31:55.049 --> 01:31:56.843
I killed him.

1103
01:31:57.093 --> 01:31:59.554
I'm Patrick Bateman.

1104
01:32:02.890 --> 01:32:05.018
I chopped Allen's
fucking head off.

1105
01:32:06.394 --> 01:32:11.274
The whole message
I left on your machine was true.

1106
01:32:11.482 --> 01:32:14.193
Excuse me.
I really must be going now.

1107
01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:17.488
No. No, listen.

1108
01:32:17.697 --> 01:32:19.991
Don't you know who I am?

1109
01:32:20.158 --> 01:32:22.827
I'm not Davis.
I'm Patrick Bateman.

1110
01:32:25.621 --> 01:32:28.750
We talk on the phone
all the time.

1111
01:32:28.958 --> 01:32:31.419
Don't you recognize me?

1112
01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:35.673
You're my lawyer.

1113
01:32:35.882 --> 01:32:40.345
Now, Carnes, listen.

1114
01:32:40.553 --> 01:32:42.722
Listen very, very carefully.

1115
01:32:46.559 --> 01:32:49.771
I killed Paul Allen,

1116
01:32:49.937 --> 01:32:51.814
and I liked it.

1117
01:32:52.023 --> 01:32:55.693
I can't make myself
any clearer.

1118
01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:59.864
But that's simply not possible.
And I don't find this funny
anymore.

1119
01:33:00.073 --> 01:33:03.493
It never was
supposed to be.
Why isn't it possible?

1120
01:33:03.701 --> 01:33:07.830
It's just not.
Why not,
you stupid bastard?

1121
01:33:08.039 --> 01:33:10.208
Because I had dinner
with Paul Allen...

1122
01:33:10.375 --> 01:33:12.835
twice in London
just ten days ago.

1123
01:33:13.002 --> 01:33:15.004
No, you...

1124
01:33:17.924 --> 01:33:20.551
didn't.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1125
01:34:01.884 --> 01:34:04.095
We've seen the results
of that mistrust...

1126
01:34:04.262 --> 01:34:07.682
in the form of lies,
provisions in the states.

1127
01:34:07.890 --> 01:34:12.270
We need to find a way
to cooperate while
realizing foreign policy...

1128
01:34:12.437 --> 01:34:14.731
can't be run
by committee.

1129
01:34:14.897 --> 01:34:17.275
And I believe there's now
the growing sense...

1130
01:34:17.483 --> 01:34:21.195
that we can accomplish more
by cooperating.

1131
01:34:21.362 --> 01:34:25.199
And in the end,
this may be the eventual
blessing in disguise...

1132
01:34:25.408 --> 01:34:27.285
to come out of
the Iran-Contra mess.

1133
01:34:27.493 --> 01:34:31.039
How can he lie like that?

1134
01:34:31.205 --> 01:34:33.082
How can he pull that shit?
What shit?

1135
01:34:33.249 --> 01:34:35.251
Now, where do we have
reservations at?

1136
01:34:35.335 --> 01:34:38.212
I'm not really hungry,
but I'd like to have
reservations someplace.

1137
01:34:38.463 --> 01:34:41.299
How can you be so fucking,

1138
01:34:41.507 --> 01:34:43.926
I don't know,
cool about it?

1139
01:34:44.052 --> 01:34:47.430
Some guys are just
born cool, I guess.

1140
01:34:52.268 --> 01:34:54.312
Bateman?

1141
01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:59.692
- What are you
so fucking zany about?
- I'm just a happy camper.

1142
01:34:59.859 --> 01:35:02.236
Rockin' and a rollin'!

1143
01:35:02.362 --> 01:35:04.364
Oh, brother, look.

1144
01:35:04.530 --> 01:35:09.452
He presents himself
as this harmless old codger,
but inside...

1145
01:35:09.619 --> 01:35:12.121
but inside...

1146
01:35:12.330 --> 01:35:15.124
But inside doesn't matter.

1147
01:35:15.333 --> 01:35:19.462
Inside? Believe or not,
Bryce, we're actually
listening to you.

1148
01:35:19.671 --> 01:35:22.131
Come on, Bateman.
What do you think?

1149
01:35:25.176 --> 01:35:29.347
- Whatever.
- Whose moronic idea was it
to order dry beers?

1150
01:35:29.555 --> 01:35:31.432
I need a scotch.

1151
01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:50.702
There are no more barriers
to cross.

1152
01:35:50.910 --> 01:35:54.622
All I have in common
with the uncontrollable
and the insane,

1153
01:35:54.789 --> 01:35:58.042
the vicious and the evil,
all the mayhem I have caused...

1154
01:35:58.209 --> 01:36:00.169
and my utter indifference
toward it,

1155
01:36:00.378 --> 01:36:02.839
I have now surpassed.

1156
01:36:05.633 --> 01:36:08.469
My pain is constant and sharp...

1157
01:36:08.636 --> 01:36:12.181
and I do not hope
for a better world for anyone.

1158
01:36:12.306 --> 01:36:16.728
In fact, I want my pain
to be inflicted on others.

1159
01:36:16.936 --> 01:36:19.355
I want no one to escape.

1160
01:36:20.565 --> 01:36:23.359
But even after admitting this,

1161
01:36:23.568 --> 01:36:25.570
there is no catharsis.

1162
01:36:25.778 --> 01:36:28.406
My punishment continues
to elude me...

1163
01:36:28.656 --> 01:36:31.784
and I gain no deeper knowledge
of myself.

1164
01:36:31.951 --> 01:36:35.580
No new knowledge can be
extracted from my telling.

1165
01:36:35.788 --> 01:36:39.876
This confession
has meant... nothing.

1166
01:37:58.955 --> 01:38:01.499
Word.

1167
01:38:55.762 --> 01:38:58.556
Come on.
