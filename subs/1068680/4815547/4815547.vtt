1
00:00:30.638 --> 00:00:32.165
No.

2
00:00:38.831 --> 00:00:41.067
No means no.

3
00:00:50.606 --> 00:00:51.915
<i>Bonjour.</i>

4
00:00:52.078 --> 00:00:53.452
<i>Carl, I know it's you.</i>

5
00:00:53.614 --> 00:00:55.240
Oh. Hey, man.

6
00:00:55.438 --> 00:00:57.805
I was just about to call you.
That's so weird.

7
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:00.170
Had your number dialed,
was about to press "send. "

8
00:01:00.334 --> 00:01:01.479
Did you block your number?

9
00:01:01.646 --> 00:01:04.843
<i>Yeah, I did. You never answer
when I don't.</i>

10
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.459
<i>So, what are you doing?</i>

11
00:01:07.631 --> 00:01:09.802
Oh, just hanging out in my apartment.

12
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.333
<i>- You did get my text, right?
- What? Text? What?</i>

13
00:01:12.494 --> 00:01:13.868
<i>We're all going out tonight.</i>

14
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.518
Man, that sounds great.
I wish I could join you.

15
00:01:16.686 --> 00:01:17.668
I'm just so jammed up.

16
00:01:17.839 --> 00:01:19.627
I'm totally off the grid,
you know?

17
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.001
<i>No, I don't at all.</i>

18
00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:24.200
I got a bunch of stuff going on.
There's this thing I gotta do.

19
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.984
Any other night would've been great.
Darn it to heck.

20
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.328
<i>Thing? What thing?</i>

21
00:01:28.495 --> 00:01:29.924
Thing, you know, just a thing.

22
00:01:30.094 --> 00:01:32.909
If I had my thing in front of me,
I could tell you what it is...

23
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.209
<i>...but I know there's a thing.
- A thing.</i>

24
00:01:35.374 --> 00:01:38.341
<i>I don't think there's anything
written down in your fake calendar.</i>

25
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.037
No, it says specific things.

26
00:01:40.206 --> 00:01:43.174
<i>Specific things.
Like "get in line at the video store"?</i>

27
00:01:43.342 --> 00:01:45.382
What? What are you talking about?

28
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.939
I'm not at the video store.
I'm in my apartment.

29
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.405
<i>I can see you, Carl.
I'm outside the video store.</i>

30
00:01:53.486 --> 00:01:55.210
<i>- That's not me.
- It's not?</i>

31
00:01:55.375 --> 00:01:58.920
Oh, I know what's happening.
There is this guy who looks just like me...

32
00:01:59.086 --> 00:02:01.061
...who goes to a lot of
the same stores I do.

33
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.757
That's probably who you're seeing.

34
00:02:02.926 --> 00:02:03.908
Wow, that's amazing...

35
00:02:04.078 --> 00:02:06.893
...because his mouth is moving
in sync with what you're saying.

36
00:02:08.526 --> 00:02:10.435
<i>Carl, I know you're not saying anything.</i>

37
00:02:11.534 --> 00:02:13.738
Carl, get outside.
I know you're not talking.

38
00:02:13.902 --> 00:02:16.455
- What? All right.
- Carl.

39
00:02:19.214 --> 00:02:22.116
- Look who's here.
- Hey. You.

40
00:02:23.215 --> 00:02:24.644
Hi.

41
00:02:24.814 --> 00:02:26.919
- I don't believe it.
- Rooney.

42
00:02:27.086 --> 00:02:30.381
Carl Allen.
Never thought I'd see the day, my man.

43
00:02:30.543 --> 00:02:33.226
- Hey.
- Thought you hung up the spurs, cowboy.

44
00:02:33.423 --> 00:02:35.245
No, I just got a lot of stuff going on...

45
00:02:35.406 --> 00:02:38.854
...some things I gotta do, issues pending,
keep me pretty busy.

46
00:02:39.022 --> 00:02:40.517
Yeah? Oh, I hear you, player.

47
00:02:40.686 --> 00:02:43.053
So we are really excited
for you to be here, Carl...

48
00:02:43.214 --> 00:02:45.549
...because we have an announcement
to make.

49
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.532
Honey, show him.

50
00:02:48.494 --> 00:02:50.152
There it is. Deal with it.

51
00:02:50.318 --> 00:02:51.562
We're engaged.

52
00:02:51.726 --> 00:02:54.028
- Oh, my God. Come on.
- Right?

53
00:02:54.191 --> 00:02:57.606
- Big step, huh?
- Yeah, it's a big step. It's a huge one.

54
00:02:57.775 --> 00:02:59.563
Man. Moving fast. That's okay.

55
00:02:59.726 --> 00:03:01.035
What has it been, six months?

56
00:03:01.198 --> 00:03:02.954
- No.
- Two years.

57
00:03:03.118 --> 00:03:05.485
Oh, yeah. That's about right, then.

58
00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:10.061
So anyway, we're gonna have
an engagement party on the 21 st. Open bar.

59
00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:12.197
Oh, you bastard.
Always knows how to get me.

60
00:03:12.366 --> 00:03:14.308
Nice. Carl, does that work for you?

61
00:03:14.734 --> 00:03:17.582
- Yeah, we'll figure it out.
- What's there to figure out?

62
00:03:18.158 --> 00:03:19.270
Oh, God, look who's here.

63
00:03:19.438 --> 00:03:21.926
I'm not falling for that, Carl.
What's to figure out?

64
00:03:22.094 --> 00:03:25.029
- Open bar. What's the problem?
- I'm serious. Stephanie's at the bar.

65
00:03:25.198 --> 00:03:28.133
- The Stephanie?
- Yes, my ex-wife. She's at the bar.

66
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.070
Oh, God, that is Stephanie.

67
00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.883
- Looks like she's with someone there too.
- They seem to be thriving. Good for her.

68
00:03:37.966 --> 00:03:40.552
They're touching each other's genitals.
Isn't that amazing?

69
00:03:40.718 --> 00:03:43.686
I'm so glad I came out. Love it.
Okay, you know what? I gotta go.

70
00:03:43.855 --> 00:03:46.058
- No. No. Carl, you're gonna stay.
- What?

71
00:03:46.222 --> 00:03:48.328
It's been years.
You leave every time she comes.

72
00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:51.015
Totally unrelated. It has nothing
to do with Stephanie.

73
00:03:51.183 --> 00:03:53.125
Carl. Peter.

74
00:03:53.294 --> 00:03:54.603
- Rooney.
- Stephanie, guys.

75
00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:55.977
Hey.

76
00:03:56.142 --> 00:03:58.149
- My boyfriend, Ted.
- Hey.

77
00:03:58.318 --> 00:04:01.187
<i>- I don't believe we...
- No, I don't believe we have.</i>

78
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.849
- You're leaving?
- Yeah, unfortunately.

79
00:04:04.015 --> 00:04:06.436
Terrible timing too,
because you just got here.

80
00:04:06.606 --> 00:04:08.133
You just got here, too, Carl.

81
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.718
Yeah, but he's got a thing.

82
00:04:11.886 --> 00:04:14.788
Yeah, that's a thing. There's a thing,
and there's no time.

83
00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.740
There's a time crunch,
and time is of the essence.

84
00:04:17.902 --> 00:04:21.415
Anyway, I am gone-orrhea.

85
00:04:23.406 --> 00:04:26.156
Wow. That didn't sound quite right.
Oh, well.

86
00:04:26.318 --> 00:04:27.812
Whoa!

87
00:04:36.366 --> 00:04:38.057
See you, guys.

88
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.848
- Oh! Hi, Tillie.
- Morning, Carl.

89
00:05:00.014 --> 00:05:02.250
Would you like to come over
for a little breakfast?

90
00:05:02.414 --> 00:05:04.454
Gee, that sounds great, but I can't.

91
00:05:04.622 --> 00:05:07.404
- Some cereal, a little yogurt?
- Yeah, no.

92
00:05:07.566 --> 00:05:09.093
How about some toast, huh?

93
00:05:09.262 --> 00:05:12.393
You know, I have to go to work,
but thanks.

94
00:05:12.558 --> 00:05:14.729
Good show tonight.
Come check us out.

95
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:17.220
Your loss. Hey, man,
wanna rock out tonight?

96
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.845
- Oh, it's you. Let me guess, no?
- Yep.

97
00:05:20.014 --> 00:05:23.210
- Yes?
- No, I meant yes to your no.

98
00:05:24.014 --> 00:05:25.258
Yeah, bye.

99
00:05:26.254 --> 00:05:30.182
Persianwifefinder. com.
No, thank you.

100
00:05:30.702 --> 00:05:34.248
Costume party. Yeah, no.

101
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.092
Oh, boy.

102
00:05:39.407 --> 00:05:40.999
Here we go.

103
00:05:41.166 --> 00:05:44.941
- Carl Allen has reported for duty.
- I'm not a soldier, Norman.

104
00:05:45.775 --> 00:05:48.076
You're a soldier on the front line
of finance.

105
00:05:48.942 --> 00:05:50.852
Norman. Line one.

106
00:05:51.887 --> 00:05:54.253
Did you wanna get that?
In the privacy of your office?

107
00:05:54.415 --> 00:05:57.349
- I'll just get it here.
- Yeah, or that.

108
00:05:57.966 --> 00:05:59.395
You're with Norman.

109
00:05:59.758 --> 00:06:04.996
Uh-huh. Are you sure? Because...
Okay. Yep. Whatever you say.

110
00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:06.443
Okay.

111
00:06:08.622 --> 00:06:10.629
Remember that promotion
we were talking about?

112
00:06:10.798 --> 00:06:12.140
- Yeah.
- It's not gonna happen.

113
00:06:12.303 --> 00:06:14.310
Tried to fight for you on the phone there.

114
00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.900
It was between you and Demko,
and they went with Demko.

115
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.852
I don't care.
I didn't really want the job badly.

116
00:06:20.014 --> 00:06:23.276
I just figured after five years,
I'd be the logical choice, but whatever.

117
00:06:23.438 --> 00:06:26.405
Look at it this way:
At least you didn't get shit-canned.

118
00:06:26.574 --> 00:06:29.257
- Do you know what that means?
- Fired?

119
00:06:29.742 --> 00:06:32.873
How did you know what that meant?
Have you heard me say that before?

120
00:06:33.038 --> 00:06:34.860
No, it's a pretty common expression.

121
00:06:35.022 --> 00:06:39.561
- In my circles. I made it up.
- Well, it's catching on.

122
00:06:39.726 --> 00:06:42.661
This'll cheer you up.
I'm having a little get-together at my place.

123
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.605
- It's a funny hat and-or wig party.
- Oh, man.

124
00:06:47.662 --> 00:06:49.091
Sucks I'm gonna be out of town.

125
00:06:49.646 --> 00:06:51.555
- You don't know what day it is.
- When is it?

126
00:06:51.726 --> 00:06:52.838
- Friday.
- I'm out of town.

127
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.277
You spoke at the same time
I did just then.

128
00:06:55.438 --> 00:06:57.959
Like you were committed
to saying what you were saying...

129
00:06:58.127 --> 00:07:01.061
...regardless of what I was gonna say.
- Hm.

130
00:07:02.286 --> 00:07:04.141
I admit, business has been slow.

131
00:07:04.302 --> 00:07:07.117
There's a lot less demand
for a small Rollerblade shop...

132
00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:09.253
...what with Big 5
and Sport Chalet...

133
00:07:09.454 --> 00:07:12.715
...but my designs are gonna
revolutionize the roller industry.

134
00:07:12.878 --> 00:07:16.621
I know that, Marv,
but you have no equity.

135
00:07:16.782 --> 00:07:17.894
- None.
- And your credit...

136
00:07:18.062 --> 00:07:20.484
Bad, but I don't wanna
sound desperate.

137
00:07:20.654 --> 00:07:23.556
- Yeah.
- I have no other options left.

138
00:07:34.062 --> 00:07:36.680
Carl. Hey. Long time no see.

139
00:07:36.846 --> 00:07:39.563
Nick Lane? Hey.

140
00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:42.573
- You don't still work at the bank, do you?
- Yeah.

141
00:07:42.734 --> 00:07:46.695
Kind of why I'm sitting outside here,
eating my lunch, wearing the nametag.

142
00:07:46.862 --> 00:07:48.804
You must be running this place by now.

143
00:07:48.974 --> 00:07:52.323
I could have. Had a couple offers.
Didn't wanna get tied down.

144
00:07:52.495 --> 00:07:53.836
- How's Stephanie?
- Good.

145
00:07:53.998 --> 00:07:55.591
God.

146
00:07:56.174 --> 00:07:58.596
She's good. What have you been doing?

147
00:07:58.766 --> 00:08:01.799
I've been all over the map, man.
I've lived.

148
00:08:01.966 --> 00:08:05.349
I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.
I ate bat in Laos.

149
00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:07.013
I shot a cow with a bazooka.

150
00:08:07.182 --> 00:08:10.052
I'm not proud of that last one,
but I did it, man.

151
00:08:10.222 --> 00:08:13.321
- Sounds wild.
- Wanna know my secret?

152
00:08:14.286 --> 00:08:15.366
I'm a yes man.

153
00:08:16.143 --> 00:08:18.379
The word "yes"
has changed my life. Here.

154
00:08:18.542 --> 00:08:20.200
No, thanks. I'm fine.

155
00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:22.057
"Fine?" I wipe my ass with "fine. "

156
00:08:22.222 --> 00:08:23.815
Wow. Okay.

157
00:08:23.982 --> 00:08:28.292
- You don't wanna work here, Carl.
- Yeah, I do.

158
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.216
No, you don't.

159
00:08:31.534 --> 00:08:32.963
Why don't you take this rock...

160
00:08:33.134 --> 00:08:36.134
...throw it at that bank
and shatter the window?

161
00:08:36.303 --> 00:08:39.172
- No, thanks.
- Then ask me if I want to.

162
00:08:39.342 --> 00:08:41.830
- Do you wanna throw that rock at the bank?
- Yes.

163
00:08:43.118 --> 00:08:44.842
Oh, my God.

164
00:08:45.006 --> 00:08:47.111
- What are you, nuts?
- Go to the seminar, Carl.

165
00:08:47.567 --> 00:08:48.549
<i>Stay right there.</i>

166
00:08:48.718 --> 00:08:50.474
- He's gonna break.
- Stop.

167
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:58.631
Carl, live your life!
You won't regret it.

168
00:08:58.798 --> 00:09:01.547
- Whoo!
- Hey, stop. Stop!

169
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.354
- I know you wanna see my band.
- No.

170
00:09:13.934 --> 00:09:14.916
Sorry.

171
00:09:16.782 --> 00:09:18.440
<i>- Hello?
- Stephanie?</i>

172
00:09:18.606 --> 00:09:20.842
<i>- Carl.
- Yeah, it's me.</i>

173
00:09:21.006 --> 00:09:24.967
Just felt like calling you.
I was missing you, I guess. Weird, huh?

174
00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:26.819
Yes, Carl. I have to go.

175
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.056
- Ted and I are taking a little boat ride.
- Oh, that's great.

176
00:09:30.222 --> 00:09:32.164
Good for you. Good for you.

177
00:09:43.151 --> 00:09:46.467
Jesus, Pete. I'm not in or I'm busy.

178
00:09:52.654 --> 00:09:56.167
Oh, come on. You're halfway through,
just snap it off already.

179
00:10:03.598 --> 00:10:07.373
- Pete? Hey. Where you been?
- You not been getting my calls?

180
00:10:07.534 --> 00:10:11.724
What? God, no.
Oh, I totally lost my phone.

181
00:10:11.886 --> 00:10:13.195
You're so full of shit.

182
00:10:14.542 --> 00:10:17.804
- Here it is.
- Yeah. There it is.

183
00:10:17.966 --> 00:10:20.649
You know what, buddy?
You missed my engagement party tonight.

184
00:10:21.006 --> 00:10:24.235
Oh, no. Oh, shoot, you're kidding.
That was tonight?

185
00:10:24.398 --> 00:10:27.497
- Mm-hm.
- I'm so sorry, man. I totally gapped it.

186
00:10:27.663 --> 00:10:30.118
Listen, I'll make it up to you.
I promise. I swear.

187
00:10:30.287 --> 00:10:33.036
You pick the day. Any day you want,
we'll go out, swashbuckle.

188
00:10:33.198 --> 00:10:35.467
- What does that even mean?
- I don't know.

189
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:39.492
This wasn't drinks at a bar, Carl.
This was my engagement party.

190
00:10:39.662 --> 00:10:42.532
- You only get married once.
- I certainly wouldn't do it again.

191
00:10:42.702 --> 00:10:45.004
I know, Carl.
I know that Stephanie left you.

192
00:10:45.166 --> 00:10:49.159
And I know that you have issues because
of it, but this isn't about you. It's about me.

193
00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:52.709
When's the last time you did anything fun?
You always make excuses.

194
00:10:52.879 --> 00:10:55.213
"I don't wanna commit.
I don't wanna be tied down. "

195
00:10:55.374 --> 00:10:57.479
I mean, do you even know
my fiancee's last name?

196
00:10:57.646 --> 00:11:00.493
Yeah. Fisher. Fishman.

197
00:11:00.655 --> 00:11:04.713
- Wait. Fishwall?
- Fishwall?

198
00:11:04.878 --> 00:11:07.977
- You think her name's Lucy Fishwall?
- No? That's wrong?

199
00:11:08.142 --> 00:11:09.571
- It's Burns.
- Burns?

200
00:11:09.903 --> 00:11:12.008
It's Lucy Burns, Carl.

201
00:11:12.175 --> 00:11:14.760
And guess what?
She doesn't like my best friend.

202
00:11:15.278 --> 00:11:18.278
I keep trying to think of reasons
why she should, but you know what?

203
00:11:18.446 --> 00:11:20.234
- I can't think of any.
- Pete, I...

204
00:11:20.398 --> 00:11:23.366
I don't wanna hear another excuse, Carl.
You do whatever you want.

205
00:11:23.534 --> 00:11:26.731
I'm telling you, you don't change your life,
you're gonna end up lonely.

206
00:11:26.894 --> 00:11:32.044
A lonely guy, Carl. Lonely guy.

207
00:11:36.686 --> 00:11:38.311
Hey, Carl.

208
00:11:41.966 --> 00:11:43.854
Hey, Rooney, come here for a second.

209
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:50.893
Carl look a little odd to you? Is it me,
or does it look like he's kind of dead?

210
00:11:52.366 --> 00:11:54.471
Nope. No more than usual.

211
00:11:54.638 --> 00:11:58.282
I don't know. I'm kind of leaning towards
thinking he might actually be dead.

212
00:12:00.462 --> 00:12:03.758
I guess I never saw him a lot,
so it's hard for me to tell the difference.

213
00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.608
Yeah, that's true.

214
00:12:06.254 --> 00:12:07.847
He never did much.

215
00:12:08.014 --> 00:12:09.290
- Wasn't a good friend.
- Nope.

216
00:12:09.998 --> 00:12:11.820
Wasn't a good anything.

217
00:12:11.982 --> 00:12:15.812
- Are there more beers in the fridge?
- Sorry, last one.

218
00:12:16.462 --> 00:12:17.738
Now, that's upsetting.

219
00:12:23.374 --> 00:12:25.229
What was that?

220
00:13:05.646 --> 00:13:10.283
<i>Welcome to yes.
We are about to begin.</i>

221
00:13:10.542 --> 00:13:13.030
<i>Please, find a seat.</i>

222
00:13:13.487 --> 00:13:16.389
Carl? Hey, Carl! Psst!

223
00:13:16.558 --> 00:13:18.020
Carl, man, hey.

224
00:13:18.191 --> 00:13:20.198
- Carl.
- Hey, Nick.

225
00:13:20.686 --> 00:13:22.475
- You made it, man.
- Did you wanna...

226
00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:24.711
Sure, let me sit down.
I knew you'd come.

227
00:13:24.878 --> 00:13:28.555
I saw it in your eyes, man.
You're gonna love this. Terrence is a genius.

228
00:13:28.718 --> 00:13:32.580
He's gonna blow your mind all over
the room. He's like a mind grenade.

229
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.117
- I'm not sure I want that.
- Yeah, but you need it.

230
00:13:35.278 --> 00:13:36.423
That's why you're here.

231
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:40.299
You have got to start saying yes, my man,
and I mean to everything.

232
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.216
It's starting.

233
00:13:43.182 --> 00:13:44.644
<i>Life.</i>

234
00:13:44.974 --> 00:13:48.389
<i>We are all living it. Or are we?</i>

235
00:13:48.559 --> 00:13:49.868
Ooh, heavy.

236
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:56.172
<i>Change is generated from consciousness,
but where is consciousness generated from?</i>

237
00:13:56.335 --> 00:13:58.374
<i>From the external.</i>

238
00:13:58.542 --> 00:14:02.437
<i>And how do we control the external?
With one word.</i>

239
00:14:03.182 --> 00:14:04.459
<i>And what is that word?</i>

240
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.918
- Yes!
- Jeez.

241
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:10.918
Yes.

242
00:14:11.534 --> 00:14:12.516
Yes.

243
00:14:14.286 --> 00:14:17.035
- Yes, yes, yes!
- Yes. Yes!

244
00:14:22.255 --> 00:14:24.327
- Yes!
- Whoo!

245
00:14:24.974 --> 00:14:26.730
The word is "yes. "

246
00:14:27.407 --> 00:14:30.603
Yes, yes, yes.

247
00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.935
- Say it a million times.
- Yes.

248
00:14:33.134 --> 00:14:34.727
Say it a million more times.

249
00:14:34.894 --> 00:14:38.058
And the word you will have said
2 million times is:

250
00:14:38.223 --> 00:14:40.262
Yes!

251
00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:47.973
Yes.

252
00:14:48.238 --> 00:14:52.940
I want you to invite yes into your lives...

253
00:14:53.102 --> 00:14:57.739
...because it will RSVP "yes. "

254
00:14:58.735 --> 00:15:03.557
When you say yes to things,
you embrace the possible.

255
00:15:03.726 --> 00:15:09.891
You gobble up all of life's energies,
and you excrete the waste.

256
00:15:10.894 --> 00:15:16.557
Before we begin today,
I'd like to welcome our new members.

257
00:15:18.862 --> 00:15:23.597
- Who among you is new?
- He is. This guy right here. He's new.

258
00:15:23.758 --> 00:15:25.798
- Over here.
- Please don't. Jesus.

259
00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:31.979
- Come on up, future yes man.
- That's okay, I'm just auditing.

260
00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:39.238
You can't audit life, my friend.
Now get on up here.

261
00:15:39.822 --> 00:15:44.808
- No, thanks. I'm cool.
- I'm sorry? What was that you said?

262
00:15:46.286 --> 00:15:50.410
- I said, I'm cool.
- Before that.

263
00:15:51.694 --> 00:15:52.871
Thank you.

264
00:15:53.038 --> 00:15:55.973
Back up just a little bit more.

265
00:15:56.142 --> 00:15:58.793
<i>- No.
- No man. No man.</i>

266
00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.933
<i>No man. No man. No man.</i>

267
00:16:01.102 --> 00:16:02.247
<i>No man. No man.</i>

268
00:16:02.414 --> 00:16:03.756
Okay.

269
00:16:05.422 --> 00:16:08.237
If the molehill won't come to Terrence...

270
00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:12.450
...Terrence will come to the molehill.

271
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.285
What's your name?

272
00:16:23.022 --> 00:16:24.396
Carl.

273
00:16:24.814 --> 00:16:26.123
Let me guess, Carl.

274
00:16:26.286 --> 00:16:28.839
Someone talked you
into coming here today, didn't they?

275
00:16:29.902 --> 00:16:32.291
- Yes.
- Yes!

276
00:16:32.463 --> 00:16:36.041
And you're not sure about this, are you?

277
00:16:36.622 --> 00:16:37.604
No.

278
00:16:37.774 --> 00:16:41.668
<i>No man. No man.
No man. No man.</i>

279
00:16:41.838 --> 00:16:43.399
You're dead, Carl.

280
00:16:44.142 --> 00:16:47.338
You say no to life,
and therefore you're not living.

281
00:16:47.758 --> 00:16:50.377
You make up excuses
to the people around you...

282
00:16:50.542 --> 00:16:51.852
...and to yourself.

283
00:16:52.334 --> 00:16:55.749
You're stuck in the same dead-end job.
You have been for years.

284
00:16:55.918 --> 00:16:59.977
You don't have a girlfriend. You don't
have anything close to a girlfriend.

285
00:17:00.142 --> 00:17:01.931
And you lost the love of your life...

286
00:17:02.094 --> 00:17:04.964
...because she couldn't be with someone
who didn't live theirs.

287
00:17:08.366 --> 00:17:12.457
And on most nights you're so bored
and filled with ennui...

288
00:17:12.622 --> 00:17:16.616
...you can't even summon the enthusiasm
necessary to masturbate.

289
00:17:17.614 --> 00:17:19.622
Am I right, Carl?

290
00:17:23.758 --> 00:17:27.173
I have had some trouble.

291
00:17:33.454 --> 00:17:36.803
- We're gonna make a covenant, Carl.
- Yes.

292
00:17:36.974 --> 00:17:40.291
<i>- Do you want to make a covenant?
- Ugh...</i>

293
00:17:41.678 --> 00:17:43.140
The word is "yes," Carl.

294
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.488
- Yes!
- Yes.

295
00:17:44.654 --> 00:17:45.636
- Yes!
- Yes.

296
00:17:45.806 --> 00:17:47.235
Yes!

297
00:17:47.662 --> 00:17:50.150
Once you leave this building...

298
00:17:50.798 --> 00:17:54.147
...every time an opportunity
presents itself...

299
00:17:54.862 --> 00:17:57.001
...no matter what it is...

300
00:17:57.166 --> 00:17:59.141
...you will say yes.

301
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:00.358
- Yes.
- Yes!

302
00:18:00.527 --> 00:18:01.770
- Yes.
- Yes!

303
00:18:01.934 --> 00:18:03.942
- Yes.
- Yes.

304
00:18:05.327 --> 00:18:07.017
What if I...

305
00:18:08.207 --> 00:18:09.799
say

306
00:18:10.222 --> 00:18:11.684
...the other word?

307
00:18:12.462 --> 00:18:15.277
You'll be making a promise to yourself.

308
00:18:15.439 --> 00:18:19.301
And when you break a promise
to yourself...

309
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.634
...things can get a little dicey.

310
00:18:22.798 --> 00:18:25.253
What do you say, Carl?

311
00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:28.744
Are you ready to make a covenant?

312
00:18:29.006 --> 00:18:30.599
- Come on, Carl.
- Yes.

313
00:18:30.766 --> 00:18:32.010
- Yes.
- Yes.

314
00:18:32.174 --> 00:18:34.214
- Yes.
- Again.

315
00:18:34.383 --> 00:18:35.757
- Yes.
- Yes.

316
00:18:35.918 --> 00:18:37.674
- Say it again.
- Yes!

317
00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:43.212
- Make me believe it.
- Yes, yes, yes.

318
00:18:46.863 --> 00:18:47.877
Yes!

319
00:19:15.407 --> 00:19:16.389
Hey, there he is.

320
00:19:16.558 --> 00:19:18.249
- That was really wonderful.
- Thank you.

321
00:19:18.414 --> 00:19:19.723
Pretty powerful stuff, huh?

322
00:19:19.886 --> 00:19:22.090
- Hey. Good to have you with us.
- Yes.

323
00:19:22.254 --> 00:19:25.570
- So are you gonna do it?
- I don't know. Maybe.

324
00:19:25.742 --> 00:19:29.768
That's weird. I didn't realize
we just stepped out of a "maybe" seminar.

325
00:19:31.854 --> 00:19:34.920
Hey, man. That's a nice car.

326
00:19:35.694 --> 00:19:38.312
Could you drive me to Elysian Park?

327
00:19:39.214 --> 00:19:40.937
<i>Oh. Ugh...</i>

328
00:19:41.102 --> 00:19:42.411
Yes!

329
00:19:43.247 --> 00:19:46.662
Sure he can. Right, Carl?

330
00:19:49.678 --> 00:19:51.052
Yeah, why not?

331
00:19:51.918 --> 00:19:55.399
Yes. You won't regret this, Carl.

332
00:20:00.622 --> 00:20:05.030
- Can I use your phone?
- Go, man, go.

333
00:20:32.719 --> 00:20:36.199
Keep going or this'll do,
because it doesn't really matter?

334
00:20:36.366 --> 00:20:38.471
Yeah, hold on a sec,
I can't hear myself think.

335
00:20:38.638 --> 00:20:42.086
It's just a little further, man.
Just right up the hill there.

336
00:20:42.254 --> 00:20:43.913
Go ahead.

337
00:20:45.199 --> 00:20:46.628
And what did you say?

338
00:20:48.014 --> 00:20:52.935
Oh, I'm just right
over here. Okay. Yeah.

339
00:20:53.518 --> 00:20:54.696
What? Hello? Hello?

340
00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:58.413
Oh, shit, man. Your battery's dead.

341
00:20:58.574 --> 00:21:00.167
Oh, great.

342
00:21:01.358 --> 00:21:05.155
<i>- Thanks.
- Well, gracias, amigo.</i>

343
00:21:05.326 --> 00:21:08.642
I mean, it's real nice of you
to give me a ride. Most people just say no.

344
00:21:09.166 --> 00:21:12.330
Course, I have been having a lot of luck
lately outside of that hotel.

345
00:21:12.783 --> 00:21:15.052
No problem. Have a good night.

346
00:21:15.886 --> 00:21:17.741
Can I borrow a couple bucks?

347
00:21:20.014 --> 00:21:20.996
Okay.

348
00:21:22.127 --> 00:21:24.069
I've come this far.

349
00:21:25.934 --> 00:21:27.527
Yes, you can.

350
00:21:27.694 --> 00:21:30.312
You got a whole lot there.
Can I have it all?

351
00:21:35.823 --> 00:21:39.084
Sure. It's all yours.

352
00:21:41.935 --> 00:21:44.236
God bless you, man.

353
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.157
Oh, come on.

354
00:22:07.214 --> 00:22:09.003
Come on, come on.

355
00:22:13.263 --> 00:22:14.440
Perfect.

356
00:22:15.566 --> 00:22:18.795
Hey, Carl. Do you wanna give
all your money away to a homeless guy?

357
00:22:18.958 --> 00:22:20.387
Yes, yes, I do.

358
00:22:20.558 --> 00:22:22.020
Letting him
burn out your phone...

359
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:24.362
...so you can't call AAA
when you run out of gas?

360
00:22:24.527 --> 00:22:26.915
That sounds like a fucking great idea!

361
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:29.801
Why don't you take a stroll
through the hills...

362
00:22:29.966 --> 00:22:33.195
...and get killed by the Manson family?
Don't mind if I do.

363
00:22:49.806 --> 00:22:51.562
Come on, man.

364
00:22:53.966 --> 00:22:57.283
Yes. Since that's my only fucking option.

365
00:23:12.622 --> 00:23:16.452
Would you like to carry a 20-pound
container of gas up a giant hill to your car?

366
00:23:16.623 --> 00:23:19.590
Oh, could I? Could I really?

367
00:23:20.942 --> 00:23:22.371
That's a good look.

368
00:23:24.206 --> 00:23:27.588
- Hi. Did you just take my picture?
- Maybe.

369
00:23:28.686 --> 00:23:30.759
Did you just run out of gas?

370
00:23:31.214 --> 00:23:32.458
Maybe.

371
00:23:34.094 --> 00:23:37.891
That sucks.
That happened to me last week.

372
00:23:38.062 --> 00:23:39.818
When you were driving
out of your way...

373
00:23:39.982 --> 00:23:43.594
...to drop off a homeless guy who wore out
your battery so you couldn't call AAA?

374
00:23:43.759 --> 00:23:46.442
No. I take it
that's what happened to you.

375
00:23:46.606 --> 00:23:48.908
No. Why would you assume that?

376
00:23:50.734 --> 00:23:51.978
He used up your phone?

377
00:23:52.143 --> 00:23:55.917
Yeah. Apparently he was the most popular
homeless man on the planet.

378
00:23:56.078 --> 00:23:58.566
He was staying connected.
It was good to see.

379
00:23:58.734 --> 00:24:01.604
I'm just glad that I could
be a part of it, really.

380
00:24:01.774 --> 00:24:04.295
- That must feel good.
- Oh, truly, truly.

381
00:24:04.462 --> 00:24:06.851
Yeah. And I'm getting some exercise,
which is cool.

382
00:24:07.503 --> 00:24:09.128
Well, do you need a ride?

383
00:24:10.158 --> 00:24:11.652
On that thing?

384
00:24:21.934 --> 00:24:24.007
Am I going too fast for you?

385
00:24:24.175 --> 00:24:26.924
No. In fact, I think you should go faster.

386
00:24:27.086 --> 00:24:29.737
That way if we crash, at least I'll die.

387
00:24:29.902 --> 00:24:32.520
I just don't wanna
be kept alive artificially.

388
00:24:41.518 --> 00:24:46.122
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking a picture. Smile.

389
00:24:47.374 --> 00:24:51.814
- I can't see. I'm blind.
- Me too. Isn't it great? Whoo!

390
00:25:03.726 --> 00:25:07.621
Yeah, that's getting it good. Yep.

391
00:25:09.678 --> 00:25:11.915
- Well, thanks again for the ride.
- No problem.

392
00:25:12.079 --> 00:25:15.177
Hopefully the color will return
to your face sometime soon.

393
00:25:15.342 --> 00:25:18.212
- I'm more of a four-wheel kind of guy.
- Really?

394
00:25:18.382 --> 00:25:21.731
I never would've guessed that.
You seemed so at ease on two.

395
00:25:23.599 --> 00:25:27.243
- Can I have my helmet back now?
- I'm still wearing it, aren't I?

396
00:25:27.406 --> 00:25:28.519
Yeah.

397
00:25:29.966 --> 00:25:31.722
Thanks.

398
00:25:32.814 --> 00:25:33.927
So you okay?

399
00:25:34.094 --> 00:25:37.160
Yeah, I'm good, unless you wanna
stick around and make out.

400
00:25:37.326 --> 00:25:39.748
- What?
- What did you say?

401
00:25:43.278 --> 00:25:44.772
Hey, I...

402
00:25:49.871 --> 00:25:51.813
Have a good night.

403
00:26:16.078 --> 00:26:17.901
Yes.

404
00:26:25.966 --> 00:26:28.333
"Yes always leads
to something good.

405
00:26:32.207 --> 00:26:34.312
Never avoid opportunities.

406
00:26:34.478 --> 00:26:36.486
They may come in any form. "

407
00:26:40.814 --> 00:26:43.913
<i>- Hello?
- Carl, it's your buddy Norman.</i>

408
00:26:44.078 --> 00:26:46.893
Well, and your boss, but more your buddy
than your boss, right?

409
00:26:47.054 --> 00:26:48.713
I guess.

410
00:26:49.934 --> 00:26:52.684
So look, we're kind of short
on Saturday staff.

411
00:26:52.846 --> 00:26:54.439
Is there any way you could come in?

412
00:26:55.406 --> 00:26:56.583
Sure.

413
00:26:56.750 --> 00:27:00.067
Nothing I like better than the inside
of a bank on a beautiful Saturday.

414
00:27:00.238 --> 00:27:04.297
Yeah. Yeah, there really is something
magical about this place.

415
00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:12.067
Would I like to increase the size
of my penis?

416
00:27:13.166 --> 00:27:14.213
Right.

417
00:27:14.766 --> 00:27:16.359
Like I need that.

418
00:27:20.558 --> 00:27:25.228
<i>- Persian wifefinder.
- Hi there. I am Faranoush.</i>

419
00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:27.779
<i>Would you be the man for me?</i>

420
00:27:28.206 --> 00:27:29.897
I guess so.

421
00:27:30.926 --> 00:27:34.090
Excuse me. I'd like to apply
for a small-business loan.

422
00:27:34.255 --> 00:27:35.498
And what's your business?

423
00:27:35.662 --> 00:27:38.761
I bake cakes in the shape
of different celebrities' faces.

424
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:42.947
- Oh, wow, Mickey Rourke.
- No. It's Bono.

425
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:45.892
Oh. Yeah, right.

426
00:27:46.062 --> 00:27:48.331
Let's hope it doesn't taste
like Mickey Rourke.

427
00:27:49.646 --> 00:27:50.923
So, what do you think?

428
00:27:54.126 --> 00:27:55.620
I think yes.

429
00:28:00.654 --> 00:28:02.148
Inta-maresting.

430
00:28:02.638 --> 00:28:04.013
Cakes, huh?

431
00:28:04.174 --> 00:28:08.102
Yeah. I just kind of went with my gut
on it, Norm.

432
00:28:08.622 --> 00:28:10.826
- You called me Norm.
- Yeah.

433
00:28:10.991 --> 00:28:14.373
- Could that, like, be my nickname?
- Yeah. I guess.

434
00:28:14.542 --> 00:28:19.179
Oh, nice. I like your style.
Car. That could be yours.

435
00:28:19.375 --> 00:28:21.163
Yeah. Carl's pretty short already, but...

436
00:28:21.326 --> 00:28:23.431
But it's the kind of dazzle
we need around here.

437
00:28:23.598 --> 00:28:25.387
- Yeah.
- And you know what I did?

438
00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:26.532
What?

439
00:28:26.703 --> 00:28:31.078
That Demko thing really chapped my ass.
I marched upstairs and I told the big guns:

440
00:28:31.247 --> 00:28:34.694
"Carl gets promoted in lieu of Demko,
or along with Demko...

441
00:28:34.862 --> 00:28:37.196
...whichever, or I walk. "

442
00:28:37.358 --> 00:28:39.530
Really? What did they say?

443
00:28:39.694 --> 00:28:43.272
Well, they were quite attracted to the me
walking option, you know, for a moment.

444
00:28:43.438 --> 00:28:45.674
- But then I threw that off the table.
- Good move.

445
00:28:45.838 --> 00:28:49.155
And they said if you started to show
some initiative, I could promote you.

446
00:28:49.902 --> 00:28:50.884
And?

447
00:28:51.086 --> 00:28:52.363
- Well, you're doing it.
- Yeah?

448
00:28:52.526 --> 00:28:54.217
- Yeah, the whole cake thing.
- Yeah.

449
00:28:54.382 --> 00:28:56.041
- You're making up nicknames.
- Okay.

450
00:28:56.207 --> 00:28:57.995
Know what?
I called Demko this morning...

451
00:28:58.158 --> 00:29:00.362
...to ask if he could work,
and know what he said?

452
00:29:00.526 --> 00:29:02.631
- No.
- How did you know that?

453
00:29:02.798 --> 00:29:03.780
He's not here.

454
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:06.219
- Yeah, but you are, Car.
- Yeah.

455
00:29:06.382 --> 00:29:09.251
And that's why I'm gonna
give the job to you.

456
00:29:09.614 --> 00:29:12.778
Norm, that's amazing.
Oh, my God. Thank you.

457
00:29:12.942 --> 00:29:16.804
Nice little raise in it for you too.
Bump up your salary to 65.

458
00:29:16.975 --> 00:29:19.692
- Thousand?
- Of course, thousand.

459
00:29:19.855 --> 00:29:22.604
Come on, let's step this thing
up a notch, Broseph.

460
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:25.412
See what I did there?

461
00:29:25.582 --> 00:29:30.667
I joined "bro" with "Joseph. " Broseph.
Pretty cool, huh?

462
00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:32.579
Very cool, Norm.

463
00:29:36.494 --> 00:29:39.363
I have been such a dick and a douche.

464
00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:42.059
More of a douche
than a dick, probably...

465
00:29:42.222 --> 00:29:44.906
...but I'm sorry. I should have been there.
I mean, really.

466
00:29:45.167 --> 00:29:49.542
- You're preaching to the choir, Carl.
- I'm telling you, man, things are different.

467
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:52.132
Okay. Wait, so wait.
You have to say yes to everything?

468
00:29:52.302 --> 00:29:55.914
Yeah, exactly. It's like you said:
I wasn't open to stuff, and now I am...

469
00:29:56.078 --> 00:29:59.941
...and things are changing for me.
It's like the era of yes has begun.

470
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:02.958
All right. Look, gets you out of the house,
I'm all for it.

471
00:30:03.118 --> 00:30:05.289
Excuse me.
Could we get another round of drinks?

472
00:30:05.454 --> 00:30:07.243
And actually, we're gonna start a tab...

473
00:30:07.406 --> 00:30:10.253
...and our good friend here, Carl,
will be taking care of it.

474
00:30:11.886 --> 00:30:16.294
- Well, you're okay with that, right, buddy?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

475
00:30:16.462 --> 00:30:17.771
Okay.

476
00:30:21.647 --> 00:30:25.770
I should be prepping my case for Monday,
but I cannot miss this.

477
00:30:25.934 --> 00:30:29.000
Hey, you, another bump of hot sauce.

478
00:30:30.414 --> 00:30:34.276
Boy, you guys are really
into this yes thing.

479
00:30:38.638 --> 00:30:39.980
Argh!

480
00:30:42.606 --> 00:30:43.981
Okay, okay.

481
00:31:03.406 --> 00:31:04.519
He did it.

482
00:31:13.582 --> 00:31:15.371
Drinks on me.

483
00:31:16.206 --> 00:31:17.351
Crazy, man.

484
00:31:18.702 --> 00:31:20.011
Carl, that was so awesome.

485
00:31:20.174 --> 00:31:22.541
- Okay.
- Excuse me. Could I...

486
00:31:22.702 --> 00:31:24.458
Absolutely.

487
00:31:24.622 --> 00:31:28.648
I don't think that's what she was
asking for, but all right.

488
00:31:31.502 --> 00:31:33.390
Was I chewing gum before?

489
00:31:33.551 --> 00:31:35.972
Hey. What do you
think you're doing, asshole?

490
00:31:36.142 --> 00:31:38.695
Easy, easy.
It was a little misunderstanding, okay?

491
00:31:38.862 --> 00:31:43.848
I'm just saying yes to life, homes.
You gotta say yes to life.

492
00:31:44.014 --> 00:31:47.047
I made a sacred "conevant. "

493
00:31:47.534 --> 00:31:49.095
That sounded naughty.

494
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:52.394
- I think you and I need to step outside.
- No. God, no.

495
00:31:52.558 --> 00:31:55.754
Okay, it's okay. I got this. I got this.

496
00:31:56.142 --> 00:31:58.630
Okay. But if I win...

497
00:31:58.798 --> 00:32:02.508
...I get to take that pretty girl of yours
to a ball...

498
00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:04.906
...because she deserves that.

499
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:08.387
Every pretty girl deserves to go to a ball.

500
00:32:09.102 --> 00:32:11.012
That is so nice.

501
00:32:14.702 --> 00:32:15.717
Oh, shit.

502
00:32:18.671 --> 00:32:22.184
All right. He punched me
right in the face, man.

503
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:24.871
- Don't worry. I got your back.
- You don't have anybody's.

504
00:32:25.039 --> 00:32:26.664
I'm sorry, man. It's all our fault.

505
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:29.448
- I haven't fighted in a fight since grade 7.
- I know.

506
00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:31.469
Hey. Are we gonna fight or what?

507
00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:35.045
Yeah, we're gonna fight.
We're gonna fight, all right. Okay?

508
00:32:35.214 --> 00:32:37.385
You want some, huh, more?

509
00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:40.779
Because I am open for business, okay?
Oh, where'd I go?

510
00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:42.917
Oh, where'd I go?

511
00:32:43.086 --> 00:32:45.093
Yeah, how do you fight
what you can't see?

512
00:32:46.318 --> 00:32:49.514
<i>Did you see The Legend of Billy Jack?</i>

513
00:32:49.902 --> 00:32:52.203
Because I'm gonna take this foot...

514
00:32:52.367 --> 00:32:55.978
...and I'm gonna whop you
on that side of your face...

515
00:32:56.142 --> 00:32:58.630
...and there's not a goddamn thing
you can do about it.

516
00:33:00.462 --> 00:33:02.763
Just don't break my teeth
off on the curb, okay?

517
00:33:02.927 --> 00:33:06.636
But let's really sell this.
Give them a show.

518
00:33:06.798 --> 00:33:07.780
What?

519
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:12.554
First, we have
to establish the ground rules.

520
00:33:12.718 --> 00:33:15.947
And the ground rules are
there are no ground rules.

521
00:33:20.174 --> 00:33:22.923
Idiot. I'm the wrong guy.

522
00:33:23.214 --> 00:33:25.734
Well, maybe you need to start
being the right guy.

523
00:33:25.902 --> 00:33:27.364
That's why you got punched out...

524
00:33:27.535 --> 00:33:30.950
...because you got the wrong attitude
right out of the gate.

525
00:33:31.118 --> 00:33:32.460
I'm over here, dickhole.

526
00:33:32.974 --> 00:33:36.422
Oh, my God. That's so funny.

527
00:33:36.718 --> 00:33:38.628
You're a complete...

528
00:33:39.854 --> 00:33:40.836
You all right?

529
00:33:41.006 --> 00:33:43.013
I almost blocked it.
Didn't get there in time.

530
00:33:43.182 --> 00:33:44.840
Okay, we're done.
We've been drinking.

531
00:33:45.006 --> 00:33:46.916
- He's really been drinking.
- Seriously, man.

532
00:33:47.087 --> 00:33:48.875
I'm glad we had this experience.

533
00:33:49.198 --> 00:33:54.217
- I think we both grew from it. Call me.
- You asshole.

534
00:33:55.694 --> 00:34:00.779
- We really did.
- Yeah. We did, bud.

535
00:34:03.854 --> 00:34:06.189
She's never gonna go to a ball.

536
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:09.033
No. No, she's not.

537
00:34:39.406 --> 00:34:43.301
- Okay. Tillie, there you are.
- Hi, Carl.

538
00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:44.812
What can I do for you?

539
00:34:44.974 --> 00:34:48.171
Well, I was wondering if you could help me
put up some shelves.

540
00:34:49.135 --> 00:34:50.661
Oh, really?

541
00:34:56.654 --> 00:35:02.503
Okay. That should just about do it.

542
00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:05.932
- I'll see you later, Tillie.
- That was wonderful, Carl.

543
00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:09.513
Oh, not so fast.

544
00:35:10.094 --> 00:35:11.436
What are you doing?

545
00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:16.045
- Oh, darn, I forgot to go to the bank.
- Oh, that's okay.

546
00:35:16.206 --> 00:35:18.662
I'm getting so forgetful.

547
00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:21.765
- It happens with age.
- Don't worry about it.

548
00:35:21.934 --> 00:35:24.617
I am gonna have to repay you somehow.

549
00:35:24.782 --> 00:35:28.710
Oh, just doing a favor for a neighbor
is good enough for me.

550
00:35:29.902 --> 00:35:32.291
You are so handsome.

551
00:35:33.262 --> 00:35:36.808
How come I never see you
with a girl over there?

552
00:35:36.974 --> 00:35:42.408
Well, I'm just... I'm not in a serious thing,
but I am dating.

553
00:35:42.574 --> 00:35:45.127
- Would you like a release?
- I'm sorry?

554
00:35:45.294 --> 00:35:48.011
You know, a sexual release?

555
00:35:48.206 --> 00:35:49.482
<i>Uh...</i>

556
00:35:50.382 --> 00:35:54.506
- What do I do here?
- Oh, you don't have to do anything, Carl.

557
00:35:54.671 --> 00:35:58.184
You just lay back
and I will take care of everything.

558
00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:01.580
I don't know what to say here.
I'm stumped. I'm baffled.

559
00:36:01.743 --> 00:36:04.677
I don't know if I'm gonna be able
to say yes to this one, Till.

560
00:36:04.846 --> 00:36:07.977
- Oh, come on.
- But thanks for the offer and the image.

561
00:36:08.142 --> 00:36:12.899
And I've got this thing I gotta do,
so I'll be seeing you.

562
00:36:14.094 --> 00:36:17.029
In my nightmares.

563
00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:20.522
Oh, come on, give me a break.

564
00:36:21.486 --> 00:36:24.552
Terrence said this would happen if I said no.
That's ridiculous.

565
00:36:24.718 --> 00:36:29.257
Get out of there.
If I wanna say no, I'll say no!

566
00:36:42.767 --> 00:36:43.749
Nice dog.

567
00:36:54.958 --> 00:36:59.148
Just relax. I'll handle this.

568
00:37:04.622 --> 00:37:06.116
Oh, God!

569
00:37:07.182 --> 00:37:10.695
<i>Oh, God! Oh, no. Oh, my...</i>

570
00:37:11.471 --> 00:37:12.518
Wow.

571
00:37:12.814 --> 00:37:14.953
<i>That... Oh...</i>

572
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:17.837
<i>That is a...</i>

573
00:37:17.998 --> 00:37:19.721
How are you doing that? Ay!

<i>"Costume party. Come as your favorite
Harry Potter character. "</i>

575
00:37:29.711 --> 00:37:30.693
You got it, Norm.

576
00:38:16.751 --> 00:38:17.733
Hi.

577
00:38:19.822 --> 00:38:23.171
Really? I've always wanted
to try it. Yeah.

578
00:38:23.342 --> 00:38:26.092
So I can expect delivery anytime
between 8 a. m. and 5:30?

579
00:38:27.407 --> 00:38:29.261
Hello. Wondering if you had a moment...

580
00:38:29.422 --> 00:38:32.172
...to discuss the Church of Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, come on in.

581
00:38:33.294 --> 00:38:36.360
- Buttercup Girls.
- Buttercup Girls.

582
00:38:37.967 --> 00:38:39.723
Yeah. All right.

583
00:38:42.542 --> 00:38:46.088
Hey. It's really working. Ah!

584
00:38:50.447 --> 00:38:53.742
It's beautiful, man. It's beautiful.

585
00:38:53.902 --> 00:38:57.317
I do wanna take guitar lessons.
I do wanna learn how to fly.

586
00:38:57.486 --> 00:38:59.079
Yes, I would like to learn Korean.

587
00:38:59.246 --> 00:39:05.956
<i>I would understand</i>

588
00:39:08.046 --> 00:39:09.475
All right, now I got it.

589
00:39:13.294 --> 00:39:14.504
Whoa.

590
00:39:27.535 --> 00:39:29.607
What did he call me?

591
00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:35.972
Homeless.

592
00:39:37.135 --> 00:39:38.858
Come and get it.

593
00:39:39.055 --> 00:39:40.942
There you are. You want some?

594
00:39:41.134 --> 00:39:42.410
He never listens.

595
00:39:43.694 --> 00:39:44.676
Yeah.

596
00:39:45.423 --> 00:39:48.619
I wanna start an
organic-fertilizer distribution business.

597
00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:53.605
Next.

598
00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:58.060
- Wanna see a... Oh, sorry.
- You know what? I'd love to.

599
00:39:58.222 --> 00:39:59.848
Way to stick in there.

600
00:40:18.382 --> 00:40:19.658
There you go.

601
00:40:19.886 --> 00:40:22.155
Hey. I came.

602
00:40:22.702 --> 00:40:24.328
Great.

603
00:40:25.646 --> 00:40:26.856
Yeah.

604
00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:30.216
Rolling Rock, please.

605
00:40:33.006 --> 00:40:35.723
- From the dawn of time...
- In the netherworld.

606
00:40:37.454 --> 00:40:39.047
There was a band.

607
00:40:39.214 --> 00:40:41.156
Oh, yes, there was.

608
00:40:41.774 --> 00:40:43.116
And we were that band.

609
00:40:43.279 --> 00:40:45.002
Yes, we were.

610
00:40:45.199 --> 00:40:46.857
And that band made rock 'n' roll.

611
00:40:47.022 --> 00:40:48.516
Oh, yes, they did.

612
00:40:49.294 --> 00:40:53.571
And that band ate arame
and other sea vegetables.

613
00:40:53.742 --> 00:40:55.116
Yeah.

614
00:40:55.278 --> 00:40:58.213
And that band was rad.

615
00:41:01.134 --> 00:41:05.924
Hello, Jake, Penelope,
Rodrigo, Phillip, Zachary.

616
00:41:06.126 --> 00:41:08.875
- We are Munchausen by Proxy.
- You're kidding me.

Hey, did you ever meet my friend Ian?
He's a computer hacker.

627
00:41:41.518 --> 00:41:44.835
He helped me erase your MySpace page.

628
00:41:45.006 --> 00:41:49.196
And your band's MySpace page.
And your Facebook page.

629
00:41:49.359 --> 00:41:51.181
Happy networking, asshole.

Maybe four times, maybe five times, maybe</i>

633
00:42:16.974 --> 00:42:19.789

641
00:43:01.742 --> 00:43:04.776
Hey. Out-of-gas make-out guy.

642
00:43:04.942 --> 00:43:08.204
Did we make out? Oh, right, we did.
Now I remember.

643
00:43:08.366 --> 00:43:11.017
- What are you doing here?
- I know. Is this crazy or what?

644
00:43:11.182 --> 00:43:13.069
- It's so crazy.
- Yeah.

645
00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:15.686
- Are you stalking me?
- No. I would never do that.

646
00:43:15.854 --> 00:43:18.702
By the way, your new living-room
furniture looks great from the yard.

647
00:43:20.014 --> 00:43:24.487
- Hey, great gig or whatever, you know.
- Thanks.

648
00:43:24.655 --> 00:43:27.884
Yeah. Strong lyrics.
You just make that stuff up?

649
00:43:28.046 --> 00:43:30.763
- It comes from personal experience.
- Cool.

650
00:43:30.926 --> 00:43:32.170
You want a drink?

651
00:43:32.366 --> 00:43:35.400
Oh, I can't. I have to wake up early.

652
00:43:35.567 --> 00:43:38.600
<i>- So I have to go, but...
- Oh, really?</i>

653
00:43:40.782 --> 00:43:43.237
But you can walk me to my scooter.

654
00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:46.892
I teach a jogging photo group...

655
00:43:47.054 --> 00:43:51.277
...for people who want to both exercise
and practice photography.

656
00:43:51.439 --> 00:43:53.740
Oh, yeah,
that's getting very popular now.

657
00:43:53.902 --> 00:43:57.732
It's in Griffith Park
and we do a loop. It's about five miles.

658
00:43:57.903 --> 00:44:00.106
It's at 6 a. m.

659
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:04.362
Wow. I haven't been up at 6 a. m.
In, like, never.

660
00:44:04.526 --> 00:44:08.487
- That's early.
- Yeah, but it makes for amazing pictures.

661
00:44:09.806 --> 00:44:11.181
Okay, so you're in a band...

662
00:44:11.343 --> 00:44:14.310
...you do the jogging photography,
what else?

663
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:16.518
Whatever I want.

664
00:44:16.686 --> 00:44:19.915
I volunteer at a shelter. I paint a little bit.

665
00:44:20.079 --> 00:44:22.413
Yeah, that's cool.
I've done some charity work.

666
00:44:22.574 --> 00:44:24.745
And some nude modeling, FYI.

667
00:44:25.999 --> 00:44:28.933
<i>Good to know, if, you know,
if I ever need to...</i>

668
00:44:30.799 --> 00:44:34.476
So anyway, my answer is yes.
I'd be happy to go out with you.

669
00:44:34.639 --> 00:44:36.646
I didn't ask you out.

670
00:44:36.814 --> 00:44:38.919
Could have fooled me
with that modeling comment.

671
00:44:39.086 --> 00:44:40.427
You said that.

672
00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:43.111
Well, whoever said it,
it made me very uncomfortable.

673
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:47.812
Hey, why don't you
come to my class tomorrow?

674
00:44:47.982 --> 00:44:51.876
Why don't you stop smothering me?
Seriously. It's way too much too soon.

675
00:44:52.046 --> 00:44:53.191
Yeah, I'd love to.

676
00:44:54.702 --> 00:44:58.444
<i>Okay. I'll see you tomorrow...</i>

677
00:44:58.606 --> 00:45:01.737
- Carl.
- Allison.

678
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:18.852
Yeah, Rooney?

679
00:45:19.022 --> 00:45:20.680
<i>Yo, Carl, hitting the clubs.</i>

680
00:45:20.846 --> 00:45:24.261
<i>Got a case of Red Bull.
Gonna pull an all-nighter. You down?</i>

681
00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:25.924
Yeah.

682
00:45:33.199 --> 00:45:35.533
Okay, guys, everybody ready?
Cameras loaded?

683
00:45:35.694 --> 00:45:36.904
- Allison?
- Yeah?

684
00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:38.859
Do we need to use a flash?

685
00:45:39.022 --> 00:45:40.778
Not when the sun's up, Reggie.

686
00:45:48.878 --> 00:45:51.977
Beautiful night, guys.
You take it to the limit, and I respect that.

687
00:45:52.143 --> 00:45:54.826
Hit me on the cell this week.
Let's do it again.

688
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:58.885
Carl, if somebody asked me to
describe tonight, I would just go, "Ow!"

689
00:45:59.054 --> 00:46:01.989
Back at you, Roon. Lee, I hardly know you,
but I feel comfortable.

690
00:46:02.158 --> 00:46:05.933
Look how close I'm getting.
Hey, Allison, it's me, Carl. I'm here.

691
00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:08.612
Allison, I'm here.

692
00:46:10.222 --> 00:46:11.335
Allison.

693
00:46:12.655 --> 00:46:15.524
Hey. Who were those guys?

694
00:46:15.694 --> 00:46:18.858
That's Rooney and my friend Lee.
He's a nurse. I was making fun of him.

695
00:46:19.023 --> 00:46:21.805
We hit a couple raves last night.
It was totally off the hook.

696
00:46:21.966 --> 00:46:24.170
- You seem a little hyper.
- Had a couple Red Bulls.

697
00:46:24.334 --> 00:46:27.912
Ever had Red Bull? I never had Red Bull.
Had Red Bull last night. I like Red Bull.

698
00:46:28.078 --> 00:46:29.866
I got a new necklace. Glows in the dark.

699
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:32.300
Can't really see it right now,
unless you do this.

700
00:46:32.463 --> 00:46:35.758
That's really something. Doesn't Red Bull
make you crash pretty hard?

701
00:46:35.918 --> 00:46:38.536
No, no, no. No, no. I don't think so. No.

702
00:46:38.702 --> 00:46:41.572
No. Hey, after we jog,
we should get a Red Bull.

703
00:46:41.742 --> 00:46:44.044
You and I could get a Red Bull.
We could share.

704
00:46:44.206 --> 00:46:45.733
- Okay, that'd be fu...
- Red Bull.

705
00:46:45.903 --> 00:46:46.982
- That sounds...
- Red Bull.

706
00:46:47.182 --> 00:46:48.327
- I think I'd...
- Red Bull.

707
00:46:48.494 --> 00:46:50.698
- I'd really...
- Red Bull.

708
00:46:50.862 --> 00:46:52.869
Red Bull.

709
00:46:53.422 --> 00:46:57.895
Okay. A lot of energy. I like it.
Everybody, this is Carl.

710
00:46:58.062 --> 00:47:00.364
- Carl, this is everybody.
- Hey, everybody.

711
00:47:01.134 --> 00:47:04.549
Come on. Let's get into shipshape.

712
00:47:11.246 --> 00:47:12.773
Oh, it's a good one.

713
00:47:14.799 --> 00:47:15.747
Hold that.

714
00:47:17.038 --> 00:47:18.118
Got it.

715
00:47:27.822 --> 00:47:29.797
Hey, Carl, you okay?

716
00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:34.340
Hold it right there.

717
00:47:49.038 --> 00:47:50.467
That's good.

718
00:47:51.662 --> 00:47:56.452
I can't put my finger on you.
You're kind of unpredictable.

719
00:47:56.814 --> 00:47:58.669
Kind of mysterious.

720
00:47:58.830 --> 00:47:59.910
You know, listen.

721
00:48:00.079 --> 00:48:03.374
I like to keep it fresh. I like to live it up.
I like to mix it up.

722
00:48:03.534 --> 00:48:05.771
If that doesn't jive with you,
we should end this.

723
00:48:05.935 --> 00:48:07.723
I love that.

724
00:48:07.886 --> 00:48:10.952
I don't know how people go through life
with the same boring routine.

725
00:48:11.118 --> 00:48:13.093
- Just shoot me.
- I know. Right in the face.

726
00:48:13.263 --> 00:48:16.558
Seriously, I dated this guy and I was
astounded at how content he was...

727
00:48:16.718 --> 00:48:19.271
...just living his life
in this closed-off little box.

728
00:48:19.438 --> 00:48:22.951
I know. It's so frustrating. I just
wanna grab these people and shake them.

729
00:48:23.119 --> 00:48:26.697
Say, "Wake up, you. You're missing out
on a little thing called life. "

730
00:48:26.862 --> 00:48:28.520
- That's so true.
- Yeah.

731
00:48:29.358 --> 00:48:32.293
So, what happened
to closed-off-little-box boy?

732
00:48:32.463 --> 00:48:35.594
It just didn't work out. It's a long story.

733
00:48:35.758 --> 00:48:39.020
Yeah? Same story
you were singing about last night?

734
00:48:39.822 --> 00:48:41.349
Might be.

735
00:48:42.222 --> 00:48:45.069
Closed-off-little-box boy, tender topic.
Probe no further.

736
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:48.362
Okay, if you must know,
we lived together.

737
00:48:48.527 --> 00:48:51.396
I thought he was it, the one,
or whatever.

738
00:48:51.566 --> 00:48:55.046
And then surprise, he ended it,
out of nowhere for no reason.

739
00:48:55.214 --> 00:48:56.523
Gone, never saw him again.

740
00:48:57.358 --> 00:49:00.904
Wow. That's rough. I'm sorry.

741
00:49:01.359 --> 00:49:04.293
Next time you should warn me
about the length of the story, though.

742
00:49:04.462 --> 00:49:05.509
Kind of dragged on.

743
00:49:05.678 --> 00:49:07.915
- I'll work on that.
- Yeah, just trim the fat.

744
00:49:08.302 --> 00:49:12.426
Ooh! Jeez. That was very healthy.

745
00:49:23.214 --> 00:49:25.581
She's spontaneous. She's ballsy.

746
00:49:25.742 --> 00:49:28.109
She has no clue what she's doing
and she doesn't care.

747
00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:29.699
She's the complete opposite of me.

748
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:32.074
Carl, could you
please pass the Cholula?

749
00:49:32.239 --> 00:49:34.126
Sure, Faranoush.

750
00:49:35.022 --> 00:49:36.396
How did you two meet again?

751
00:49:36.558 --> 00:49:40.071
Persianwifefinder. Com. It's pretty cool.
You should check it out.

752
00:49:40.238 --> 00:49:42.540
- I'm engaged.
- Oh, yeah.

753
00:49:42.702 --> 00:49:45.004
Should you talk about Allison
in front of Faranoush?

754
00:49:45.167 --> 00:49:47.916
It's okay, man. We just met.
She knows it's not exclusive.

755
00:49:48.078 --> 00:49:51.755
- Besides, she's totally not my type.
- I can hear you.

756
00:49:51.918 --> 00:49:53.260
Sorry, Faranoush.

757
00:49:53.838 --> 00:49:57.483
Anyway, I never would've met Allison
if I hadn't said yes to the homeless guy.

758
00:49:57.647 --> 00:49:59.719
You wouldn't be on a date
with a strange woman.

759
00:49:59.886 --> 00:50:02.188
- No offense, Faranoush.
- None taken.

760
00:50:02.351 --> 00:50:05.318
I didn't realize
I was dealing with a no man.

761
00:50:05.486 --> 00:50:08.868
No, I think it's great.
Throw this away for me, will you?

762
00:50:11.822 --> 00:50:14.026
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

763
00:50:15.822 --> 00:50:19.881
- Lucy. Faranoush, Lucy. Lucy, Faranoush.
- Hello.

764
00:50:21.903 --> 00:50:23.626
So my friends are being really lame...

765
00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:26.823
...and nobody's offered
to throw me a bridal shower.

766
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:29.259
Hey, I have an idea.

767
00:50:29.583 --> 00:50:32.365
Carl, would you like to throw Lucy
a bridal shower?

768
00:50:32.719 --> 00:50:35.501
Yeah. Sure.

769
00:50:35.662 --> 00:50:37.801
Why not? That'd be great.
Yeah, I'd love that.

770
00:50:37.967 --> 00:50:39.461
- Problem solved.
- Yeah.

771
00:50:45.039 --> 00:50:47.046
- Really?
- Yeah.

772
00:50:47.215 --> 00:50:50.117
Well, thanks, Carl.

773
00:50:50.478 --> 00:50:54.373
Thanks, that's really sweet.

774
00:50:54.799 --> 00:50:56.587
- That's great.
- That is sweet, Carl.

775
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:58.660
Thanks, Faranoush.

776
00:50:58.926 --> 00:51:01.577
Oh, I forgot, I gotta pick up costumes
for me and Allison.

777
00:51:01.742 --> 00:51:02.952
Costumes for what?

778
00:51:04.399 --> 00:51:06.886
<i>Expelliarmus! Just kidding.</i>

779
00:51:07.054 --> 00:51:09.062
That's okay. I blocked it
and deflected it back.

780
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:12.875
Oh. Kaching!
Wow. Cool costume, my man.

781
00:51:13.039 --> 00:51:15.494
The only one they had left
was for toddlers.

782
00:51:15.663 --> 00:51:18.794
This is Allison
and her wand made from a sequoia.

783
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:20.968
- Hi.
- You must be Norman.

784
00:51:21.134 --> 00:51:25.127
Yes, nice to meet you.
Thanks for coming. Come in.

785
00:51:26.479 --> 00:51:28.966
Yeah, we've got, well, drinks,
you know...

786
00:51:29.134 --> 00:51:30.695
...chips, dips...

787
00:51:30.862 --> 00:51:34.059
...and good people, just like you two.

788
00:51:34.863 --> 00:51:36.106
- Thanks.
- Pace yourselves.

789
00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:37.929
It's gonna be a crazy night.

790
00:51:43.406 --> 00:51:45.991
- Get in there, play the zone.
- Come on.

791
00:51:46.158 --> 00:51:48.580
- Good dip, huh, H.P.?
- Mm.

792
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:52.744
Got tons of it at Costco. You see, I've got
an exclusive membership card.

793
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:55.757
And with that card, I get access
to the whole place.

794
00:51:55.918 --> 00:51:59.366
I can buy large quantities of anything
at discount prices.

795
00:51:59.726 --> 00:52:01.798
Can't anyone get one of those cards?

796
00:52:02.254 --> 00:52:05.767
No, don't think so.
But I can talk to someone, if you'd like.

797
00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:08.998
- Yeah, put in a good word for us.
- That would be great.

798
00:52:10.639 --> 00:52:13.453
<i>Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?</i>

799
00:52:13.774 --> 00:52:17.156
"I'm not going home, not really. "

800
00:52:19.886 --> 00:52:21.609
<i>Oh, bye.</i>

801
00:52:25.934 --> 00:52:29.251
<i>Alrighty, gang.
Who wants to watch Chamber of Secrets?</i>

802
00:52:37.519 --> 00:52:40.453
- Well, thanks for coming, guys.
- So nice to meet you.

803
00:52:40.622 --> 00:52:43.044
Good to meet you, too. Thank you.
And hey.

804
00:52:43.214 --> 00:52:46.313
That's right. Come in. I'll go in.

805
00:52:46.478 --> 00:52:50.122
Keep your hand there like in a shake.
The other hand goes around for a hug.

806
00:52:50.286 --> 00:52:53.483
- Yeah. Tap it.
- Thanks for walking me through that.

807
00:52:53.646 --> 00:52:55.369
- That's all right.
- Bye.

808
00:52:55.534 --> 00:52:58.502
Okay, guys,
all aboard the Hogwarts Express.

809
00:52:58.670 --> 00:53:00.645
Next stop, Azkaban.

810
00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:09.960
Hey.

811
00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:12.423
Do you wanna drive?

812
00:53:18.446 --> 00:53:21.707
- Hey, you're getting better.
- Yeah, not bad, huh?

813
00:53:22.991 --> 00:53:25.195
Whoa. Yep, I got it.

814
00:53:30.734 --> 00:53:32.938
I got an idea.

815
00:53:38.382 --> 00:53:42.506
- We can't do this.
- Why? You scared?

816
00:53:45.454 --> 00:53:49.644
Hurry. Somebody's coming.
And I think I see something. Hurry.

817
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:57.132
- This is crazy.
- I know, but it's great.

818
00:54:22.062 --> 00:54:24.517
This is unreal.

819
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:26.790
I couldn't agree more.

820
00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:37.867
<i>Ooh</i>

821
00:54:40.078 --> 00:54:41.507
<i>Ooh</i>

822
00:54:47.022 --> 00:54:48.266
<i>Ooh</i>

823
00:55:03.086 --> 00:55:06.763
You know, I've never let anyone
drive my scooter before.

824
00:55:07.375 --> 00:55:10.920
I've never let anyone kiss me
on the stage of the Hollywood Bowl before.

825
00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:36.325
Good evening, Los Angeles.

826
00:55:36.494 --> 00:55:39.560
Please welcome to the Hollywood Bowl
Munchausen by Proxy.

827
00:55:41.134 --> 00:55:42.727
I'm your biggest fan. Bang!

828
00:55:42.895 --> 00:55:44.040
I killed her.

829
00:55:45.486 --> 00:55:46.696
I'm a somebody.

830
00:55:47.854 --> 00:55:49.959
I don't know about that.

831
00:55:50.126 --> 00:55:52.613
- Come on, you gotta have creepy fans.
- I don't think so.

832
00:55:52.782 --> 00:55:55.848
- We don't have that much of a following.
- What are you talking about?

833
00:55:56.014 --> 00:55:58.632
Rodrigo and the guys at the bar.
They can't be trusted.

834
00:55:58.798 --> 00:56:03.588
There's me and my friends. That makes
eight or nine very unstable people.

835
00:56:03.759 --> 00:56:07.752
- How many people can this place even hold?
- Like 17,000.

836
00:56:07.918 --> 00:56:12.587
So each one of us invites 1800
of our closest friends.

837
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:15.565
No need.
I know our music isn't that mainstream.

838
00:56:15.726 --> 00:56:17.482
- What?
- I love doing it.

839
00:56:17.966 --> 00:56:19.373
It's like my photography.

840
00:56:19.534 --> 00:56:21.901
I know there isn't that much demand
for photographs...

841
00:56:22.062 --> 00:56:23.589
<i>...taken while running, but...</i>

842
00:56:23.758 --> 00:56:25.798
I wasn't gonna say anything.

843
00:56:25.966 --> 00:56:29.349
You know, who cares?
The world's a playground.

844
00:56:29.518 --> 00:56:31.045
You know that when you're a kid...

845
00:56:31.214 --> 00:56:33.734
...but somewhere along the way,
everyone forgets it.

846
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:36.365
I love your music.

847
00:56:36.622 --> 00:56:39.339
Anybody can take a photo standing still.

848
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:43.718
- Hey. What are you doing?
- Oh, shit.

849
00:56:43.886 --> 00:56:45.479
- Stop.
- Stopping.

850
00:56:45.647 --> 00:56:47.850
- Come on, Carl, run.
- Thanks.

851
00:56:48.014 --> 00:56:49.356
- Wait right there.
- You got it.

852
00:56:49.518 --> 00:56:51.209
- Down on the ground.
- Whatever you say.

853
00:56:51.374 --> 00:56:55.629
- Carl, what are you doing? Let's go.
- All right. I can't please everyone.

854
00:56:58.670 --> 00:56:59.848
Run!

855
00:57:00.110 --> 00:57:01.735
Hello, everybody.

856
00:57:01.902 --> 00:57:07.118
A little vitamin C. Keep your strength up.
I will be right with you.

857
00:57:07.279 --> 00:57:09.351
- Pass those out, will you?
- Sure.

858
00:57:13.582 --> 00:57:16.168
- Lee?
- Hey.

859
00:57:16.334 --> 00:57:18.701
What up, my brizzo?

860
00:57:19.982 --> 00:57:22.949
- That's not right, is it?
- Carl, I need you for a second.

861
00:57:24.014 --> 00:57:26.283
Can you hang on a minute, Lee?

862
00:57:27.662 --> 00:57:29.637
What's going on, Norm?

863
00:57:29.807 --> 00:57:31.563
Something's going down on a big scale.

864
00:57:31.727 --> 00:57:35.523
Guy from Corporate's here. Don't look.
He wants to talk to you.

865
00:57:35.694 --> 00:57:38.728
I think it's about all those loans
you've been approving.

866
00:57:39.342 --> 00:57:41.993
Well, we had a nice run.

867
00:57:42.158 --> 00:57:44.329
I might get shit-canned, Norm.

868
00:57:44.654 --> 00:57:47.524
Anyway, don't worry about it.
It'll lead to something good.

869
00:57:47.695 --> 00:57:49.734
- Hey, I'm part of this too.
- No.

870
00:57:49.902 --> 00:57:52.237
- Yeah. I stood by and let it happen.
- Norm.

871
00:57:52.399 --> 00:57:54.919
You were feeling it.
You were in the loan zone, remember?

872
00:57:55.086 --> 00:57:56.296
- I was.
- I was watching you.

873
00:57:56.462 --> 00:57:57.640
Yeah, you were.

874
00:57:57.806 --> 00:58:01.188
But I'm afraid it's caught up with us.
Now you and I have to face the music.

875
00:58:01.358 --> 00:58:04.391
- Come on.
- Hey. Can I have one minute?

876
00:58:04.558 --> 00:58:07.406
- Okay.
- Lee? What do you need?

877
00:58:07.566 --> 00:58:09.322
You may be my last loan.

878
00:58:11.246 --> 00:58:12.904
It's a Ducati.

879
00:58:13.070 --> 00:58:16.419
I'm thinking it'll get people off my back
about the male nurse thing.

880
00:58:17.711 --> 00:58:21.060
- See what I mean?
- Yeah. Nice ride.

881
00:58:22.926 --> 00:58:25.511
See you on the other side, Lee.

882
00:58:28.174 --> 00:58:29.799
Carl.

883
00:58:32.078 --> 00:58:35.144
Wesley T. Parker.
Vice President, Brea Federal Savings.

884
00:58:35.310 --> 00:58:37.132
Pleasure to meet you.

885
00:58:44.014 --> 00:58:48.487
Every two months, the typical loan officer
approves 35 to 40 loans.

886
00:58:48.654 --> 00:58:50.596
You have given out...

887
00:58:51.342 --> 00:58:53.230
...561.

888
00:58:53.902 --> 00:58:55.364
A little more than average, then.

889
00:58:55.534 --> 00:58:57.803
What's even more unusual
are the amounts.

890
00:58:58.286 --> 00:59:04.909
A $250 loan for a mountain bike,
$600 for windsurfing lessons.

891
00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:06.925
Have you ever tried that? It's fun.

892
00:59:07.086 --> 00:59:09.955
Carl, this bank traditionally has never
given out small loans.

893
00:59:10.126 --> 00:59:12.166
- If I can explain... Yeah, certainly.
- Sit down.

894
00:59:12.334 --> 00:59:14.701
At first I thought
you might be raiding our coffers.

895
00:59:14.894 --> 00:59:17.764
- I would never do that.
- I would if I could, so why wouldn't you?

896
00:59:23.758 --> 00:59:25.252
But...

897
00:59:27.406 --> 00:59:28.683
But then I looked closer.

898
00:59:29.422 --> 00:59:32.008
These people are so grateful
to have their needs met...

899
00:59:32.174 --> 00:59:35.174
...more than 98 percent of them
are following through with payments.

900
00:59:35.342 --> 00:59:37.349
And because you've given out
so many of them...

901
00:59:37.518 --> 00:59:41.609
...we're actually making a lot of money.
Carl, these micro-loans, not bad.

902
00:59:41.966 --> 00:59:43.941
See, Car, you worrywart.

903
00:59:44.111 --> 00:59:47.526
Carl, what would you say if I asked you
to work upstairs with the big boys?

904
00:59:47.726 --> 00:59:49.865
- Corporate?
- Wow.

905
00:59:50.094 --> 00:59:52.101
That's great. I would have to say...

906
00:59:52.270 --> 00:59:54.987
No, wait. Before we give our answer...

907
00:59:55.150 --> 00:59:57.223
...let's talk money.
Dollars and cents, Wes.

908
00:59:57.390 --> 01:00:01.133
I'm afraid I can't discuss that with you,
since we're only taking Carl.

909
01:00:01.614 --> 01:00:02.923
Got it. Yep.

910
01:00:03.086 --> 01:00:05.934
We'll have the employment contract to you
by the end of the day.

911
01:00:06.094 --> 01:00:08.515
Nice work, Carl. Bump my fist.

912
01:00:08.686 --> 01:00:12.996
- Missed it. I was gonna fist you.
- Here's some fist.

913
01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:21.226
This one is nice.

914
01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:23.692
I especially love it in cream.
What do you think?

915
01:00:23.854 --> 01:00:24.836
- I love it.
- Yeah?

916
01:00:25.006 --> 01:00:26.315
Yeah.

917
01:00:26.478 --> 01:00:29.893
Bridal bingo?
How do you play bridal bingo?

918
01:00:30.062 --> 01:00:31.720
It's the same as regular bingo...

919
01:00:31.886 --> 01:00:35.367
...but you just yell embarrassing facts
about the bride, okay?

920
01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:37.381
Yeah.

921
01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:39.372
- No, I'm not doing bridal bingo.
- Come on.

922
01:00:39.535 --> 01:00:41.061
I don't want anything complicated.

923
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:43.914
You gotta squeeze every drop of juice
out of this experience.

924
01:00:44.079 --> 01:00:46.413
It doesn't sound complicated.
Is it complicated?

925
01:00:46.574 --> 01:00:50.022
Are you going to be asking a lot
more question? I don't got all day.

926
01:00:53.262 --> 01:00:57.092
- Maybe we should just go somewhere else.
- It's okay. I'll talk to her.

927
01:01:43.982 --> 01:01:44.964
Okay.

928
01:01:48.559 --> 01:01:50.926
Okay, bridal bingo very simple, okay?

929
01:01:51.086 --> 01:01:54.381
I can explain to you in more detail
if you want.

930
01:02:00.718 --> 01:02:01.929
What's going on?

931
01:02:03.598 --> 01:02:05.573
I mean, someone's trying to kill himself.

932
01:02:06.799 --> 01:02:08.325
Jump.

933
01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:11.299
What the hell are you looking at?

934
01:02:12.303 --> 01:02:15.685
- Don't do it.
- Don't point at me, buddy.

935
01:02:15.854 --> 01:02:17.676
Hey, lady, move that dog.

936
01:02:18.254 --> 01:02:20.710
Buddy, can you move over a little bit,
like two feet?

937
01:02:20.878 --> 01:02:22.285
Has somebody called the police?

938
01:02:22.446 --> 01:02:25.763
Yeah. He'll be dead before they get here.
Somebody needs to talk him down.

939
01:02:25.934 --> 01:02:29.131
- Move out the way.
- Somebody help him!

940
01:02:47.086 --> 01:02:48.548
Don't do it.

941
01:02:50.574 --> 01:02:52.396
It can't be that bad.

942
01:02:54.702 --> 01:02:56.044
Hey, buddy.

943
01:02:56.654 --> 01:02:58.083
Who are you, man?

944
01:02:58.254 --> 01:03:01.800
Don't try anything. I'm gonna kill myself,
so don't try to stop me.

945
01:03:02.414 --> 01:03:04.781
- Okay.
- What do mean, "Okay"?

946
01:03:04.942 --> 01:03:08.325
No, I don't mean okay.
Just give me a second.

947
01:03:08.878 --> 01:03:10.918
I should say something to you here.

948
01:03:12.527 --> 01:03:14.021
I don't really know what it is.

949
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:16.198
Man, you terrible at this.
Are you even a cop?

950
01:03:16.367 --> 01:03:18.254
Hold on a second, I'm thinking.

951
01:03:21.038 --> 01:03:23.853
Wait. I've got it.

952
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:28.231
Where you going, man?

953
01:03:28.399 --> 01:03:31.049
- I know it's not what I think it is.
- Just stop.

954
01:03:31.214 --> 01:03:32.709
Oh, man.

955
01:03:37.934 --> 01:03:41.579
- My man. Hello?
- Don't do it. I'm coming.

956
01:03:41.742 --> 01:03:44.197
Patience is a virtue.

957
01:03:47.022 --> 01:03:49.837
What the hell you doing in there?

958
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:56.391
<i>I wish you would step back
From that ledge, my friend</i>

959
01:03:57.199 --> 01:04:02.796
<i>You could cut ties with all the lies
That you've been living in</i>

960
01:04:02.959 --> 01:04:06.406
<i>And if you never want to see me again</i>

961
01:04:06.574 --> 01:04:11.528
<i>I would understand</i>

962
01:04:11.695 --> 01:04:18.405
<i>I would understand</i>

963
01:04:18.734 --> 01:04:20.490
Um... Oh...

964
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:21.990
What is it?

965
01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:25.350
<i>The angry boy a bit too insane</i>

966
01:04:25.550 --> 01:04:28.233
<i>Icing over a secret pain</i>

967
01:04:28.398 --> 01:04:33.417
<i>You know you don't belong</i>

968
01:04:33.582 --> 01:04:37.575
<i>Everyone I know has got a reason</i>

969
01:04:37.998 --> 01:04:39.427
<i>To say</i>

970
01:04:39.598 --> 01:04:41.027
<i>You can put the past away</i>

971
01:04:41.199 --> 01:04:45.061
<i>I wish you would step back
From that ledge, my friend</i>

972
01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:49.769
<i>You could cut ties with all the lies
You've been living in</i>

973
01:04:49.934 --> 01:04:53.480
<i>And if you never want to see me again</i>

974
01:04:53.646 --> 01:04:58.152
<i>I would understand</i>

975
01:04:58.318 --> 01:05:01.035
<i>I would understand</i>

976
01:05:02.894 --> 01:05:07.498
<i>I would understand</i>

977
01:05:07.662 --> 01:05:11.492
<i>I would understand</i>

978
01:05:12.238 --> 01:05:14.540
<i>I would understand</i>

979
01:05:22.894 --> 01:05:25.349
I got blisters on my fingers.

980
01:05:33.326 --> 01:05:34.853
Carl.

981
01:05:35.278 --> 01:05:37.733
Stephanie, Ted, hey.

982
01:05:37.902 --> 01:05:39.909
How's it going?
What are you guys doing here?

983
01:05:40.078 --> 01:05:43.690
We're doing a week in Tahiti. Ted's father
owns a little piece of property there.

984
01:05:43.855 --> 01:05:47.978
A hundred acres isn't so little, hon.
Not in Tahiti, anyway.

985
01:05:48.974 --> 01:05:52.771
Hey, I saw you on TV.
That was amazing, Carl.

986
01:05:52.942 --> 01:05:55.910
It's just a little life that needed saving.
No big deal.

987
01:05:56.079 --> 01:05:58.445
- So where you headed?
- I'm meeting my girlfriend here.

988
01:05:58.607 --> 01:06:00.461
- We don't know where we're going.
- Really?

989
01:06:00.622 --> 01:06:04.038
Yeah, we're just gonna pick a place.
Kind of an eenie, meenie, minie thing.

990
01:06:04.206 --> 01:06:07.370
Keeps it fresh. I'll see you guys.

991
01:06:08.974 --> 01:06:11.462
- That sounds like a lot of fun.
- Can you imagine?

992
01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:13.256
No.

993
01:06:24.398 --> 01:06:26.056
So I have some carry-on here.

994
01:06:26.222 --> 01:06:30.445
I'd like two tickets on the first plane
out of here, please.

995
01:06:30.606 --> 01:06:32.133
We've never done this before.

996
01:06:34.766 --> 01:06:39.044
The next flight available for boarding...

997
01:06:39.598 --> 01:06:40.972
...is to Lincoln, Nebraska.

998
01:06:42.862 --> 01:06:43.845
Okay.

999
01:06:44.014 --> 01:06:44.996
- Okay.
- Okay.

1000
01:06:45.166 --> 01:06:46.279
- Yeah?
- Lincoln.

1001
01:06:46.446 --> 01:06:47.559
Here we come.

1002
01:06:51.342 --> 01:06:53.447
Where does someone go
in Lincoln, Nebraska?

1003
01:06:53.614 --> 01:06:56.516
Well, clearly we should go there.

1004
01:07:02.094 --> 01:07:04.199
"The earliest switchboard
operators' headsets...

1005
01:07:04.366 --> 01:07:06.537
...weighed over 10 and a half pounds. "

1006
01:07:06.702 --> 01:07:09.386
- Interesting.
- Look at this.

1007
01:07:10.830 --> 01:07:13.197
- Very first phone call ever.
- Pretty cool.

1008
01:07:13.358 --> 01:07:14.984
Check out the phone.

1009
01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:18.533
Smaller than I thought they would be.
Hold on, I'm vibrating.

1010
01:07:18.702 --> 01:07:20.524
Hello?

1011
01:07:24.686 --> 01:07:26.093
Nice shot.

1012
01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:31.558
- What do you know about that?
- Pretty sexy.

1013
01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:34.253
So, what do I do? I just...

1014
01:07:35.886 --> 01:07:38.188
- Take it easy.
- Here you go.

1015
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:41.892
- Okay.
- You got it.

1016
01:07:42.062 --> 01:07:43.044
Pull?

1017
01:07:44.846 --> 01:07:46.821
- Good one.
- I got it. I got it.

1018
01:07:46.991 --> 01:07:49.773
Can I do it again? Can I do it again?
What's wrong?

1019
01:07:55.534 --> 01:07:57.389
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it...</i>

1020
01:07:57.551 --> 01:08:01.642
<i>...for your University
of Nebraska Cornhuskers.</i>

1021
01:08:09.358 --> 01:08:11.246
Twenty bucks says
Oklahoma kills them.

1022
01:08:11.406 --> 01:08:13.861
Hey, Pete, you mind putting that
on a coaster?

1023
01:08:14.030 --> 01:08:15.557
What, do you live here now?

1024
01:08:15.726 --> 01:08:19.207
Yeah. I asked Carl and he had to say yes.

1025
01:08:19.375 --> 01:08:21.928
Hey. Is that Carl?

1026
01:08:22.094 --> 01:08:24.134
- Wait a second.
- Wait a second, wait a second.

1027
01:08:25.454 --> 01:08:30.505
<i>The energy is palpable here,
Chris. I can't even hear myself think.</i>

1028
01:08:31.438 --> 01:08:34.024
- I guess they're in Nebraska.
- Wow.

1029
01:08:34.639 --> 01:08:39.014
Now, this is the really interesting part.
If you don't take the heads off properly...

1030
01:08:39.183 --> 01:08:41.572
...then everything gets mixed
into the batch.

1031
01:08:41.742 --> 01:08:44.612
Someone gets a beak in their bucket
or a mouthful of tendons...

1032
01:08:44.782 --> 01:08:47.433
...and you got a lawsuit on your hands.

1033
01:08:48.686 --> 01:08:50.791
We got a fainter down in Head Removal.

1034
01:08:55.599 --> 01:08:58.151
I can't believe
I tripped like that.

1035
01:08:59.439 --> 01:09:02.854
- It seemed like you fainted.
- No, I told you my foot caught a nail.

1036
01:09:03.022 --> 01:09:06.470
- Okay. Because I thought it was
all the chicken beaks in the bucket.

1037
01:09:06.638 --> 01:09:08.427
Don't, please.

1038
01:09:10.126 --> 01:09:12.363
Oh, God. It's starting to rain.

1039
01:09:13.646 --> 01:09:15.915
Here. I have to protect you.

1040
01:09:16.174 --> 01:09:17.603
Come on.

1041
01:09:17.774 --> 01:09:21.484
Hurry, there's no time to lose.
We have to find shelter.

1042
01:09:21.646 --> 01:09:23.272
Come on.

1043
01:09:24.655 --> 01:09:28.102
Get in here. It's okay. I got you.

1044
01:09:28.270 --> 01:09:30.888
Allison, are you okay?

1045
01:09:31.534 --> 01:09:34.698
Are you hurt? Are you hurt? You're okay?

1046
01:09:40.942 --> 01:09:42.218
What?

1047
01:09:43.278 --> 01:09:45.700
I don't know. I think I love you.

1048
01:09:47.054 --> 01:09:48.461
Really?

1049
01:09:48.622 --> 01:09:53.030
I've known that I like you for a while,
but just now I decided that I love you.

1050
01:09:53.199 --> 01:09:56.362
- Do you love me?
- Definitely.

1051
01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:58.185
I love you like...

1052
01:09:58.670 --> 01:10:01.834
...I can't believe it.
It's kind of ridiculous.

1053
01:10:02.606 --> 01:10:04.013
I've been thinking...

1054
01:10:04.174 --> 01:10:06.563
...and I know it's crazy,
especially for me...

1055
01:10:06.734 --> 01:10:11.404
...but maybe when we get back
we should move in together.

1056
01:10:12.686 --> 01:10:15.883
Wow. Really? You've been thinking that?

1057
01:10:16.366 --> 01:10:17.926
What do you think?

1058
01:10:18.094 --> 01:10:22.350
- What do I think? Uh... Yeah.
- Oh, God. You paused.

1059
01:10:22.511 --> 01:10:23.918
- No, I didn't pause.
- You paused.

1060
01:10:24.079 --> 01:10:25.966
No, I didn't pause.
It was just a big step.

1061
01:10:26.126 --> 01:10:28.647
It was a stupid idea.
I shouldn't have said anything.

1062
01:10:28.814 --> 01:10:32.557
Come on, what are you talking about?
Here, ask me again.

1063
01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:34.666
- Do you wanna move...
- Yes.

1064
01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:39.140
<i>Did I pause there? I could probably knock
a couple milliseconds off that if you...</i>

1065
01:10:53.327 --> 01:10:56.807
- Where are you traveling today?
- Los Angeles.

1066
01:10:59.534 --> 01:11:02.218
I'll just be one minute.

1067
01:11:02.382 --> 01:11:05.731
We should do this every weekend.
We could see the whole world.

1068
01:11:05.902 --> 01:11:07.658
I'm in.

1069
01:11:07.886 --> 01:11:10.537
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1070
01:11:13.358 --> 01:11:14.700
Sir?

1071
01:11:16.015 --> 01:11:18.862
- You mind coming with us, please?
- I'm sorry?

1072
01:11:19.022 --> 01:11:21.739
We just wanna ask you a few questions.

1073
01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:26.888
You're hilarious. Oh, that's great.

1074
01:11:27.054 --> 01:11:29.737
Oh, beautiful. Are you in on this too?

1075
01:11:29.902 --> 01:11:31.975
Oh, my God, you guys really
had me going there.

1076
01:11:32.142 --> 01:11:34.859
There's a crazy man in the terminal.
Red alert.

1077
01:11:36.238 --> 01:11:38.474
- Oh, good job.
- Let's go, funny guy.

1078
01:11:38.638 --> 01:11:40.165
Come on, lady.

1079
01:11:41.839 --> 01:11:44.970
- Do you hate your country, Mr. Allen?
- What?

1080
01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:49.127
- Do you hate America?
- No. Of course not.

1081
01:11:49.294 --> 01:11:51.182
Then why are you plotting to attack it?

1082
01:11:51.342 --> 01:11:53.251
- What?
- I think you have the wrong guy.

1083
01:11:53.422 --> 01:11:55.178
I'm sorry. Was I speaking to you?

1084
01:11:55.342 --> 01:11:57.414
We've been tracking you.
We know who you are.

1085
01:11:57.582 --> 01:12:00.997
- We know what you're planning.
- This is insane. Do you think I'm a terrorist?

1086
01:12:01.166 --> 01:12:03.883
Why did you purchase these plane tickets
at the last minute?

1087
01:12:04.046 --> 01:12:06.054
It was a spontaneous vacation.

1088
01:12:06.222 --> 01:12:08.077
Right. I was just saying
to Agent Tweed...

1089
01:12:08.238 --> 01:12:11.369
...how I wanted to take a fun-filled
vacation to Lincoln, Nebraska.

1090
01:12:11.534 --> 01:12:15.495
Are you currently a member
of Persianwifefinder. Com?

1091
01:12:15.694 --> 01:12:18.596
- Yes, but you don't understand.
- Yes? Who is that?

1092
01:12:18.767 --> 01:12:21.766
Faranoush. It was nothing. I can explain.
I can explain.

1093
01:12:21.934 --> 01:12:25.546
Explain this, jackhole. As Chief Loan Officer
at Brea Federal Savings and Loan...

1094
01:12:25.710 --> 01:12:28.132
you gave a man money
to start a fertilizer business.

1095
01:12:28.302 --> 01:12:29.731
- For what, bombs?
- No.

1096
01:12:29.902 --> 01:12:32.007
Have you recently
started taking flying lessons?

1097
01:12:32.174 --> 01:12:34.596
- Yes. Oh, come on.
- Why did you learn Korean?

1098
01:12:34.766 --> 01:12:37.068
- Are you aligned with the North Koreans?
- No. What?

1099
01:12:37.230 --> 01:12:39.685
You were married for six months.
Some immigration thing?

1100
01:12:39.854 --> 01:12:41.894
- You were married?
- Yes.

1101
01:12:42.862 --> 01:12:44.935
That was a long time ago.
I was gonna tell you.

1102
01:12:45.102 --> 01:12:47.622
I was gonna tell her. I just never...

1103
01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:50.605
Start talking, Carl,
if that is your real name.

1104
01:12:51.694 --> 01:12:55.556
We knew another Karl we weren't
too crazy about, didn't we, Tweed?

1105
01:12:56.815 --> 01:12:58.603
His name was Marx.

1106
01:13:02.158 --> 01:13:04.297
I need to speak to my attorney.

1107
01:13:08.814 --> 01:13:11.814
Several months ago, my client
attended a self-empowerment seminar...

1108
01:13:11.982 --> 01:13:16.619
...that requires him to say yes
to any request that's presented.

1109
01:13:16.782 --> 01:13:18.789
All of the activity
that appears suspicious...

1110
01:13:18.958 --> 01:13:21.925
...the flying lessons,
the spontaneous trip-taking...

1111
01:13:22.094 --> 01:13:24.712
...it's all because he must say yes
to any opportunity.

1112
01:13:25.902 --> 01:13:28.074
- He's really into it.
- You say yes to everything?

1113
01:13:28.239 --> 01:13:30.061
- Are you kidding?
- It's not how it sounds.

1114
01:13:30.222 --> 01:13:31.749
How does it?
I'd love to hear this.

1115
01:13:31.918 --> 01:13:34.853
I'm wondering if there's a better setting
for this back and forth.

1116
01:13:35.022 --> 01:13:37.869
Maybe we should speak privately.
Come on outside.

1117
01:13:40.558 --> 01:13:43.592
- Whew. That was close.
- What the hell, Carl?

1118
01:13:43.759 --> 01:13:45.646
Are you serious?
You say yes to everything?

1119
01:13:45.806 --> 01:13:48.556
- Even if you don't like it?
- No, of course not.

1120
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:51.012
- Sometimes.
- Oh, good. What a relief.

1121
01:13:51.183 --> 01:13:54.761
I thought you lied all the time, but it's
just sometimes. That's excellent.

1122
01:13:54.926 --> 01:13:56.584
So you didn't wanna
come to my show...

1123
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:59.979
...you didn't wanna go jogging with me,
you didn't wanna travel with me?

1124
01:14:00.142 --> 01:14:01.898
Yes, I did. That was my idea.

1125
01:14:02.062 --> 01:14:03.971
When I asked you
if you wanted to move in...

1126
01:14:04.142 --> 01:14:06.476
...that took a lot for me to do that,
and I meant it.

1127
01:14:06.639 --> 01:14:09.159
I didn't know what to expect,
but I guess I figured...

1128
01:14:09.326 --> 01:14:11.562
...like an adult, you were gonna
weigh the options.

1129
01:14:11.726 --> 01:14:12.871
You paused.

1130
01:14:13.038 --> 01:14:15.591
You wanted to say no but you couldn't.
You had to say yes.

1131
01:14:15.758 --> 01:14:19.719
- That's not entirely true.
- How do I know if anything you did...

1132
01:14:19.886 --> 01:14:23.879
...was because you wanted to or because
you were following some damn program?

1133
01:14:31.214 --> 01:14:32.424
Allison.

1134
01:14:34.062 --> 01:14:35.469
Bye, Carl.

1135
01:14:49.135 --> 01:14:52.550
I can't believe I didn't tell her
I was married. I'm such an idiot.

1136
01:14:53.294 --> 01:14:54.821
- You know what I did?
- What's that?

1137
01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:58.057
She asked me to move in with her
and I hesitated. That was like a no.

1138
01:14:58.222 --> 01:15:00.132
I should have said yes right away,
you know?

1139
01:15:00.303 --> 01:15:03.150
That's how the whole thing got
screwed up. I broke the covenant.

1140
01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:04.871
Ever think things got screwed up...

1141
01:15:05.038 --> 01:15:08.748
...because you said yes without thinking,
not because of a covenant you made?

1142
01:15:08.910 --> 01:15:10.797
It's with the universe.
It's a big deal.

1143
01:15:10.959 --> 01:15:13.325
There is a middle ground here.
You can process things.

1144
01:15:13.487 --> 01:15:16.902
You can weigh them individually and
make decisions on a case-by-case basis...

1145
01:15:17.070 --> 01:15:18.477
...a. k. a. What normal people do.

1146
01:15:18.639 --> 01:15:21.289
Yeah, that's a good point.
Hold that thought. Allison!

1147
01:15:21.454 --> 01:15:22.534
Or not.

1148
01:15:22.702 --> 01:15:24.524
Allison, please, can't we talk for a sec?

1149
01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:26.115
- Get away from me.
- Okay.

1150
01:15:26.894 --> 01:15:28.170
- Farther.
- Yeah.

1151
01:15:30.063 --> 01:15:31.404
Carl.

1152
01:15:35.119 --> 01:15:36.526
Bye, Carl.

1153
01:15:37.294 --> 01:15:40.076
<i>- Oh, I just love good food.
- So do I.</i>

1154
01:15:40.238 --> 01:15:41.994
<i>- Do you?
- Uh-huh.</i>

1155
01:15:42.158 --> 01:15:44.013
<i>You know you and I are a lot alike?</i>

1156
01:15:45.198 --> 01:15:47.435
<i>My mother likes good food.</i>

1157
01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:50.790
<i>She always used to say,
"I'd rather eat good food...</i>

1158
01:15:50.958 --> 01:15:52.813
<i>...than bad food any old day
of the week. "</i>

1159
01:15:52.974 --> 01:15:54.468
Hey.

1160
01:15:54.767 --> 01:15:56.555
It's me again.

1161
01:15:56.718 --> 01:15:59.085
Specifically I'm talking about 15
to 20 percent.

1162
01:15:59.246 --> 01:16:02.094
<i>The way we're gonna do this
is we're gonna go after the...</i>

1163
01:16:17.359 --> 01:16:20.042
Okay, I'm totally off the controls.

1164
01:16:20.878 --> 01:16:23.431
You're officially flying by yourself.

1165
01:16:24.942 --> 01:16:26.371
Cool.

1166
01:16:26.799 --> 01:16:29.701
There's no greater feeling in the world,
is there?

1167
01:16:32.815 --> 01:16:38.052
Hello, Jake, Rodrigo,
Penelope, Phillip, Zachary.

1168
01:16:38.223 --> 01:16:39.979
I'd like to thank you all for coming...

1169
01:16:40.143 --> 01:16:43.142
...for no other reason
than you genuinely wanted to.

1170
01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:46.823
In an unrelated note,
everyone else can go jump off a bridge.

1171
01:16:58.383 --> 01:17:00.008
Ah!

1172
01:17:16.975 --> 01:17:18.087
Allison?

1173
01:17:18.254 --> 01:17:22.215
No, it's Wes P., Big C.
Did I catch you at a bad time?

1174
01:17:22.383 --> 01:17:27.238
<i>- No, no, I'm just hanging here.
- Okay, okay. Just checking in.</i>

1175
01:17:27.406 --> 01:17:29.162
Seeing how Corporate's treating you.

1176
01:17:29.326 --> 01:17:31.628
Kicks the crap out of dealing
with those peons, huh?

1177
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:35.368
<i>- I never really thought of them as...
- Hang on, hang on, hang on, just a second.</i>

1178
01:17:37.678 --> 01:17:40.646
Wes? Can you hear me?

1179
01:17:40.814 --> 01:17:42.025
<i>Go get the ball!</i>

1180
01:17:42.191 --> 01:17:45.486
So listen, I got a job for you.
We're shutting down a bunch of branches...

1181
01:17:45.646 --> 01:17:49.388
...and I need you to tell the managers.
- Shutting down branches?

1182
01:17:49.806 --> 01:17:51.213
Which ones?

1183
01:17:52.814 --> 01:17:55.334
We are Sparta!

1184
01:17:58.926 --> 01:18:00.300
Hi, Norm.

1185
01:18:22.574 --> 01:18:24.778
<i>You have three messages.</i>

1186
01:18:24.942 --> 01:18:27.560
<i>Hi, Car, this is your
answer phone speaking.</i>

1187
01:18:27.726 --> 01:18:30.475
<i>No, it's me, Norm, just a reminder
about the party tonight.</i>

1188
01:18:30.639 --> 01:18:33.573
<i>I'll see you there, buddy. Roger, out.</i>

1189
01:18:33.966 --> 01:18:36.650
<i>Carl, it's Roons.
Thanks for letting me use your car.</i>

1190
01:18:36.814 --> 01:18:39.269
<i>You might notice the front bumper missing.
Not to worry.</i>

1191
01:18:39.439 --> 01:18:42.089
<i>I gave them your insurance.
The whole thing's being handled.</i>

1192
01:18:42.254 --> 01:18:46.444
<i>And I left a pile of laundry in my room.
Don't forget, no starch. Love you.</i>

1193
01:18:47.022 --> 01:18:49.924
<i>It's Peter. I'm sure you're aware
and completely on top of it...</i>

1194
01:18:50.095 --> 01:18:53.706
<i>...but just wanted to make sure Lucy's
shower is still on for tomorrow night.</i>

1195
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:56.870
<i>Haven't received confirmation
of any sort from you. At all.</i>

1196
01:18:57.038 --> 01:18:59.591
<i>- Shower. Shit.
- It's on.</i>

1197
01:18:59.758 --> 01:19:01.645
<i>Right? Call me.</i>

1198
01:19:13.646 --> 01:19:14.628
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

1199
01:19:14.799 --> 01:19:17.254
- What's wrong?
- I just really need to talk to you.

1200
01:19:17.422 --> 01:19:18.633
What?

1201
01:19:18.799 --> 01:19:21.352
Come on inside. I'll explain everything.

1202
01:19:26.382 --> 01:19:28.553
Surprise!

1203
01:19:28.718 --> 01:19:31.206
- Oh, my God.
- Happy shower.

1204
01:19:31.375 --> 01:19:32.781
How did you pull this off?

1205
01:19:32.943 --> 01:19:35.496
I just called in a few favors,
kept throwing money at it.

1206
01:19:36.206 --> 01:19:38.410
I like it, I like it.

1207
01:19:38.574 --> 01:19:39.948
- Rooney.
- Congrats.

1208
01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:42.118
- That's Bert. He's in fertilizer.
- Hey, B.

1209
01:19:42.287 --> 01:19:44.359
- And Lee, he's a male nurse.
- I know Lee.

1210
01:19:44.815 --> 01:19:47.532
Let's get this guy a drink.
He doesn't have long to live.

1211
01:19:47.695 --> 01:19:50.084
On him, on him.

1212
01:19:52.974 --> 01:19:53.956
Cake?

1213
01:19:54.126 --> 01:19:55.108
- Thanks.
- Sure.

1214
01:19:55.279 --> 01:19:59.501
- Oh, John Goodman.
- No, it's Alec Baldwin.

1215
01:20:01.006 --> 01:20:03.876
Oh, right. Nailed it.

1216
01:20:10.062 --> 01:20:13.892
Norm. Hey, thanks for coming, man.

1217
01:20:14.062 --> 01:20:16.779
- How you holding up?
- I'm okay, Car.

1218
01:20:16.942 --> 01:20:19.692
You know, taking her day by day.

1219
01:20:19.854 --> 01:20:22.571
Yeah. Well, I got a friend
I want you to meet.

1220
01:20:22.959 --> 01:20:24.038
Oh.

1221
01:20:28.271 --> 01:20:32.526
- Norman, this is Soo-Mi.
- Hi there.

1222
01:20:34.318 --> 01:20:38.508
- Can I call you Soo?
- Yes.

1223
01:20:38.670 --> 01:20:39.653
Do you dance?

1224
01:20:40.206 --> 01:20:42.595
Well, I've won some competitions.
Watch this.

1225
01:20:42.767 --> 01:20:46.182
- Come on.
- Look out. Oh, hey.

1226
01:21:11.374 --> 01:21:16.775
<i>- Oh, that's an interesting one.
- Yep. And it's half-price, so...</i>

1227
01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:22.699
Oh, jeez.

1228
01:21:23.278 --> 01:21:26.442
- That's the best wedding shower ever, man.
- Man, you deserve it.

1229
01:21:26.606 --> 01:21:28.494
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1230
01:21:28.654 --> 01:21:31.621
- Yeah? She's still not calling you back?
- No.

1231
01:21:31.790 --> 01:21:34.211
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

1232
01:21:34.382 --> 01:21:38.277
I guess I'll just stick with the program.
Keep saying yes to everything.

1233
01:21:38.447 --> 01:21:39.973
I know it sounds silly...

1234
01:21:40.142 --> 01:21:42.597
...but maybe that bad stuff
will lead to something good.

1235
01:21:42.766 --> 01:21:46.890
Doesn't sound silly.
Well, maybe a little silly.

1236
01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:49.096
You wanna get dinner tomorrow night?

1237
01:21:49.263 --> 01:21:52.132
- Yes. And not because I have to.
- Great.

1238
01:21:52.302 --> 01:21:54.822
- Well, you do have to.
- Yeah.

1239
01:21:55.727 --> 01:21:58.345
- But you want to.
- Oh, yeah.

1240
01:21:58.511 --> 01:22:00.878
- So bad.
- Oh, God, me too.

1241
01:22:01.039 --> 01:22:02.926
- It's all I can think about.
- Really?

1242
01:22:08.174 --> 01:22:09.996
Hi there.

1243
01:22:10.894 --> 01:22:12.454
Hello there.

1244
01:22:13.198 --> 01:22:16.046
You must be Tillie.

1245
01:22:17.038 --> 01:22:21.828
- I've certainly heard a lot about you.
- Isn't that nice?

1246
01:22:25.198 --> 01:22:31.046
- Would you mind helping me?
- Absolutely, yeah. No problem.

1247
01:22:32.398 --> 01:22:34.057
Come on, let's go.

1248
01:22:43.502 --> 01:22:45.957
- Hello?
- Hi, Carl.

1249
01:22:46.574 --> 01:22:52.204
<i>- Oh, Stephanie. What's wrong?
- Can you come over?</i>

1250
01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:55.116
We had this big fight and he stormed off.

1251
01:22:55.278 --> 01:22:58.988
Well, these things have a way
of working themselves out.

1252
01:22:59.150 --> 01:23:00.808
I don't know.

1253
01:23:01.678 --> 01:23:05.507
- Not this time. I think it's over.
- Yeah?

1254
01:23:06.798 --> 01:23:09.165
You know,
but maybe it's supposed to be.

1255
01:23:09.326 --> 01:23:13.418
I mean, a part of me felt like something
wasn't right from the beginning.

1256
01:23:13.582 --> 01:23:17.739
- Yeah?
- I don't know, Carl. I'm so confused.

1257
01:23:17.902 --> 01:23:23.914
<i>Yeah. I'm gonna assume at this point,
it's, well...</i>

1258
01:23:24.078 --> 01:23:26.926
<i>- Stay with me tonight.
- Oh, Steph...</i>

1259
01:23:31.566 --> 01:23:33.225
Steph...

1260
01:23:33.870 --> 01:23:35.626
...I can't.

1261
01:23:36.238 --> 01:23:37.863
I'm sorry.

1262
01:23:40.271 --> 01:23:42.125
What are you saying?

1263
01:23:43.694 --> 01:23:45.800
I'm saying no.

1264
01:24:01.614 --> 01:24:03.021
Are you serious?

1265
01:24:16.814 --> 01:24:17.926
Oh, Jesus.

1266
01:24:25.102 --> 01:24:27.524
Oh, please.

1267
01:24:28.015 --> 01:24:31.495
I didn't even see the red zone.
I've only been here for 20 minutes.

1268
01:24:31.662 --> 01:24:35.556
- Sorry, pal. Can't help you.
- Oh, come on. Can't you give me a break?

1269
01:24:35.726 --> 01:24:39.403
No, man, no, man, no, man.

1270
01:24:39.566 --> 01:24:43.592
<i>- No man, no man, no man...
- Not possible!</i>

1271
01:24:45.742 --> 01:24:47.782
Jackoff.

1272
01:24:48.814 --> 01:24:54.117
<i>Chapter 26,
"Words That Rhyme With Yes. "</i>

1273
01:24:54.287 --> 01:24:56.807
<i>Guess, mess.</i>

1274
01:24:56.974 --> 01:25:02.757
<i>Tess, that's a name.
Less, a word and a name.</i>

1275
01:25:02.927 --> 01:25:04.814
- Terrence, don't freak out.
- What the fuck?

1276
01:25:28.462 --> 01:25:31.113
Jesus, that nurse couldn't be
any more obvious.

1277
01:25:32.462 --> 01:25:36.008
She was coming in the room. It's like,
"Give me some space, woman. "

1278
01:25:36.175 --> 01:25:39.590
Again, I'm pretty sure
she was just here checking on Carl.

1279
01:25:39.854 --> 01:25:41.709
Peter.

1280
01:25:42.414 --> 01:25:44.007
A covenant.

1281
01:25:44.174 --> 01:25:46.378
Hey, buddy, you all right?

1282
01:25:46.958 --> 01:25:49.805
The covenant, it's coming down
hard on me, man.

1283
01:25:50.638 --> 01:25:53.355
- He keeps talking this covenant nonsense.
- It's not nonsense.

1284
01:25:53.518 --> 01:25:54.925
It is nonsense.

1285
01:25:56.591 --> 01:25:58.117
It's him.

1286
01:25:59.598 --> 01:26:03.689
Oh, thank God. Terrence. You have to
remove the covenant. It's killing me.

1287
01:26:03.854 --> 01:26:06.538
First of all, what were you doing
in my car?

1288
01:26:06.702 --> 01:26:09.036
I told you,
I need you to remove the covenant.

1289
01:26:09.198 --> 01:26:12.875
There is no covenant. There never was.
I was just riffing.

1290
01:26:13.871 --> 01:26:16.009
- Riffing?
- Well, I had to say something.

1291
01:26:16.174 --> 01:26:19.687
You were being difficult,
embarrassing me in front of my crowd.

1292
01:26:19.854 --> 01:26:22.701
- So the whole yes thing is all bullshit?
- No.

1293
01:26:22.863 --> 01:26:24.870
You just don't know how to use it,
that's all.

1294
01:26:25.039 --> 01:26:27.821
Yeah, I do. Say yes to everything.
Real tough to grasp.

1295
01:26:27.982 --> 01:26:29.869
No, that's not the point.

1296
01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:33.675
Well, maybe at first it is,
but that's just to open you up to it...

1297
01:26:33.838 --> 01:26:35.398
...to get you started.

1298
01:26:35.566 --> 01:26:38.086
Then you're saying yes,
not because you have to...

1299
01:26:38.254 --> 01:26:40.589
...not because a covenant tells you to...

1300
01:26:40.751 --> 01:26:43.565
...but because you know in your heart
that you want to.

1301
01:26:44.782 --> 01:26:46.375
Yeah.

1302
01:26:46.926 --> 01:26:48.584
You're right.

1303
01:26:49.294 --> 01:26:52.076
- That makes perfect sense.
- I told you. I said that.

1304
01:26:52.238 --> 01:26:53.580
- You didn't say that.
- I did.

1305
01:26:53.742 --> 01:26:56.197
- You didn't say it like that.
- Not with an accent.

1306
01:26:56.782 --> 01:27:00.677
Thanks, Terrence. Sorry about the car,
and your head there.

1307
01:27:01.454 --> 01:27:05.164
- What time is it?
- It's 5:40 in the morning.

1308
01:27:05.326 --> 01:27:06.536
Perfect.

1309
01:27:09.230 --> 01:27:10.921
I said that.

1310
01:27:11.119 --> 01:27:12.679
Whatever.

1311
01:27:14.447 --> 01:27:17.862
I'm gonna hop in the bed
just in case the nurse comes back.

1312
01:27:21.966 --> 01:27:24.333
- Sir, you need to get back to your room.
- No, I don't.

1313
01:27:24.494 --> 01:27:26.731
- Sir, stop right there.
- Eat me.

1314
01:27:29.199 --> 01:27:32.995
- Lee. What are you doing here?
- I'm a nurse, remember?

1315
01:27:33.166 --> 01:27:37.356
Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.
Can I borrow your car?

1316
01:27:37.518 --> 01:27:41.773
No, I don't have my car anymore.
I've got my Ducati, thanks to you.

1317
01:27:42.382 --> 01:27:44.422
Ducati.

1318
01:27:49.166 --> 01:27:52.461
Have you ever driven one of these before?
They're quite powerful.

1319
01:27:52.622 --> 01:27:55.688
Yeah, I ride double all the time
on the scooter with Allison.

1320
01:27:55.854 --> 01:27:58.091
No, Carl,
this is not the same.

1321
01:27:58.255 --> 01:28:01.124
You really have to be careful. Okay?
These things have a lot of...

1322
01:28:02.095 --> 01:28:03.982
Holy Jesus.

1323
01:28:04.142 --> 01:28:05.352
- Torque.

1324
01:28:17.262 --> 01:28:19.236
- How you doing?
- Can't complain.

1325
01:28:21.039 --> 01:28:22.216
Ah!

1326
01:28:22.702 --> 01:28:24.458
You might wanna get out of the way.

1327
01:28:35.278 --> 01:28:37.580
- Come on. Jerk.
- I'm sorry.

1328
01:28:40.526 --> 01:28:41.541
Ah!

1329
01:28:45.262 --> 01:28:46.604
Whoa!

1330
01:29:29.230 --> 01:29:30.921
What an asshole.

1331
01:29:46.479 --> 01:29:47.973
Carl, what are you doing here?

1332
01:29:48.142 --> 01:29:51.885
I just wanted to tell you
that I don't wanna live with you.

1333
01:29:52.046 --> 01:29:55.013
Oh, wow. Thanks.
My knight in shining armor.

1334
01:29:55.182 --> 01:29:57.571
Okay, people, let's go.

1335
01:30:00.974 --> 01:30:02.022
But I wanna be with you.

1336
01:30:02.190 --> 01:30:04.296
But I don't wanna be with you.
I don't know you.

1337
01:30:04.462 --> 01:30:06.918
Everything I said I meant,
except about living together.

1338
01:30:07.086 --> 01:30:09.323
That makes me nervous,
but that's normal. It's big.

1339
01:30:09.486 --> 01:30:11.974
We shouldn't just jump into that
without thinking.

1340
01:30:12.142 --> 01:30:15.939
Why not? You do it with everything.
You say yes to whatever comes your way.

1341
01:30:16.110 --> 01:30:18.957
That's not true. You can say no
if you don't want something.

1342
01:30:19.119 --> 01:30:21.540
Brilliant, Carl. Where'd you get that?
Your literature?

1343
01:30:21.710 --> 01:30:23.619
Look, I know the philosophy
has some holes.

1344
01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:27.402
You think? Seems pretty airtight to me.

1345
01:30:27.566 --> 01:30:30.413
But if I hadn't done that,
I never would've met you.

1346
01:30:30.574 --> 01:30:33.542
Because the old Carl
didn't think he was enough for anybody.

1347
01:30:33.710 --> 01:30:36.612
I thought if I said yes to things
and got involved with people...

1348
01:30:36.782 --> 01:30:39.019
...sooner or later,
they'd find out I'm not enough.

1349
01:30:39.535 --> 01:30:41.902
I didn't think I had anything to share.

1350
01:30:42.063 --> 01:30:45.194
But now I know that what I have to share
is pretty huge, and I wanna share it with you.

1351
01:30:46.478 --> 01:30:48.518
- Do you mind, Reggie?
- Seriously, dude.

1352
01:30:48.686 --> 01:30:50.628
Sorry, this seemed interesting.

1353
01:30:51.214 --> 01:30:53.581
Even if I had met you,
I never would've asked you out.

1354
01:30:53.742 --> 01:30:56.938
You were the complete opposite of me.
You did things and had friends...

1355
01:30:57.102 --> 01:31:00.037
...and sang in rock bands
and made life happen.

1356
01:31:00.206 --> 01:31:02.061
You weren't scared of anything.

1357
01:31:02.223 --> 01:31:04.776
You don't think I'm scared of anything?

1358
01:31:04.942 --> 01:31:07.976
Who do you think I am?
I'm scared of a lot of things.

1359
01:31:08.558 --> 01:31:10.467
And I'm scared too.

1360
01:31:10.638 --> 01:31:12.613
So let's be scared together.

1361
01:31:14.478 --> 01:31:16.388
I don't know what you want me to say.

1362
01:31:17.006 --> 01:31:18.413
So just say yes...

1363
01:31:18.926 --> 01:31:21.261
...but only if you really want to.

1364
01:31:21.486 --> 01:31:24.486
And can you do it kind of soon?
I think I'm starting to get a chill.

1365
01:31:25.742 --> 01:31:27.498
Yeah, I noticed that.

1366
01:31:28.014 --> 01:31:29.323
Well?

1367
01:31:35.854 --> 01:31:37.993
- Maybe.
- Come on.

1368
01:31:38.830 --> 01:31:42.278
- I'm not gonna say that word.
- Okay, maybe's fine. Maybe's good.

1369
01:31:48.974 --> 01:31:50.567
I like maybe.

1370
01:31:50.734 --> 01:31:51.879
- Reggie, come on.
- Dude.

1371
01:32:17.711 --> 01:32:21.027
Excuse me,
but pleats are kind of out of style.

1372
01:32:21.199 --> 01:32:23.271
You got anything with a flat front?

1373
01:32:23.438 --> 01:32:25.293
Oh, Soo-Mi, pleats are out?

1374
01:32:27.822 --> 01:32:29.196
Thanks, guys.

1375
01:32:29.358 --> 01:32:31.846
This is the single biggest donation
that we've ever had.

1376
01:32:32.014 --> 01:32:34.469
You're welcome, but it was Carl
that made it all happen.

1377
01:32:34.639 --> 01:32:35.948
You're a good man, Carl.

1378
01:32:36.110 --> 01:32:40.452
No big deal. I know a lot of people
who are willing to give.

1379
01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:46.987
Say it a million times.
Say it a million more times.

1380
01:32:47.150 --> 01:32:51.406
And the word
you will have said 2 million times is:

1381
01:32:51.566 --> 01:32:53.802
Yes!

1382
01:32:59.054 --> 01:33:01.126
Good God.

1383
01:34:31.374 --> 01:34:33.414
So anything else
we need to know?

1384
01:34:33.582 --> 01:34:37.673
Your instinct is gonna be to brake
with your chin or your forehead.

1385
01:34:37.838 --> 01:34:39.332
- Try to resist that.
- Right.

1386
01:34:39.502 --> 01:34:40.811
Right.

1387
01:34:42.030 --> 01:34:43.306
Oh, and thanks for the loan.

1388
01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:46.056
I never could have finished the suits
without it.

1389
01:34:47.694 --> 01:34:51.077
Listen, I'm not gonna think anything
less of you if you don't wanna do this.

1390
01:34:51.246 --> 01:34:52.228
What?

1391
01:34:52.398 --> 01:34:55.213
I mean, I'm still gonna be attracted
to you if you're a chicken.

1392
01:34:55.374 --> 01:34:56.967
What if I'm
one of those chickens...

1393
01:34:57.134 --> 01:35:00.298
...whose head doesn't get severed
and my beak ends up in the bucket?

1394
01:35:00.462 --> 01:35:03.277
I'll see you at the bottom.
Unless you pass out.

1395
01:35:03.982 --> 01:35:06.852
I told you,
my foot caught a nail.

1396
01:35:07.023 --> 01:35:08.200
Hiyah!

1397
01:35:53.134 --> 01:35:54.596
I love this.
