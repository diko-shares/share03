1
00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:40.965
No.

2
00:00:47.738 --> 00:00:49.039
No means no.

3
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.318
Bonjour.

4
00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:03.020
Carl, I know it's you.

5
00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:04.787
Oh, hey, man.

6
00:01:04.788 --> 00:01:07.490
I was just about to call you.
That's so weird.

7
00:01:07.491 --> 00:01:10.060
Had your number dialed,
was about to press "send."

8
00:01:10.061 --> 00:01:11.494
Did you block your number?

9
00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:14.297
Yeah, I did.
You never answer when I don't.

10
00:01:14.298 --> 00:01:16.033
Hm.

11
00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:17.567
So what are you doing?

12
00:01:17.568 --> 00:01:20.070
Oh, just hanging out
in my apartment.

13
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:21.304
You did get my text, right?

14
00:01:21.305 --> 00:01:22.805
What? Text? What?

15
00:01:22.806 --> 00:01:24.007
We're all going out tonight.

16
00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:25.808
Oh, man, that sounds great.

17
00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:27.144
I wish I could join you.

18
00:01:27.145 --> 00:01:28.411
I'm just so jammed up.

19
00:01:28.412 --> 00:01:30.013
I'm totally off the grid,
you know?

20
00:01:30.014 --> 00:01:31.681
Uh, no, I don't. At all.

21
00:01:31.682 --> 00:01:33.450
I got a bunch of stuff going on.

22
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:35.018
There's this thing I gotta do.

23
00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:36.753
Any other night
would have been great.

24
00:01:36.754 --> 00:01:38.055
Darn it to heck.

25
00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:39.389
Thing? What thing?

26
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.091
Thing, you know, just a thing.

27
00:01:41.092 --> 00:01:42.359
If I had my thing
in front of me,

28
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.094
I could tell you what it is,

29
00:01:44.095 --> 00:01:45.262
but I know there's a thing.

30
00:01:45.263 --> 00:01:46.496
A thing. Huh.

31
00:01:46.497 --> 00:01:48.131
I don't think there's anything

32
00:01:48.132 --> 00:01:49.932
written down
in your fake calendar.

33
00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:51.668
No, it says specific things.

34
00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:52.902
Specific things.

35
00:01:52.903 --> 00:01:54.971
Like "uh, get in line
at the video store"?

36
00:01:54.972 --> 00:01:57.207
What? What are you
talking about?

37
00:01:57.208 --> 00:01:59.742
I'm not at the video store.
I'm in my apartment.

38
00:01:59.743 --> 00:02:03.047
I can see you, Carl.
I'm outside the video store.

39
00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:07.417
That's not me.
It's not?

40
00:02:07.418 --> 00:02:09.018
Oh, I know what's happening.

41
00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.054
There is this guy
who looks just like me

42
00:02:11.055 --> 00:02:13.323
who goes to a lot of the same
video stores that I do.

43
00:02:13.324 --> 00:02:15.292
That's probably who
you're seeing right now.

44
00:02:15.293 --> 00:02:16.893
Wow, that's amazing,

45
00:02:16.894 --> 00:02:19.729
because his mouth is moving
in sync with what you're saying.

46
00:02:20.998 --> 00:02:23.401
Carl, I know
you're not saying anything.

47
00:02:24.268 --> 00:02:25.335
Carl, get outside.

48
00:02:25.336 --> 00:02:26.869
I know you're not talking.

49
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.538
What?
Carl.

50
00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:29.540
All right.

51
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.576
Look who's here.

52
00:02:33.577 --> 00:02:35.612
Hey. You.

53
00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:36.646
Right?
Wow.

54
00:02:36.647 --> 00:02:37.880
Hi.

55
00:02:37.881 --> 00:02:39.048
I don't believe it.

56
00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.050
Rooney.

57
00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:42.519
Carl Allen.

58
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.421
Never thought
I'd see the day, my man.

59
00:02:44.422 --> 00:02:45.522
Hey.

60
00:02:45.523 --> 00:02:47.124
Thought you hung up
the old spurs, cowboy.

61
00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:48.625
Nah, I just got
a lot of stuff going on,

62
00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:51.027
some things I gotta do,
issues pending,

63
00:02:51.028 --> 00:02:52.995
keep me pretty busy.

64
00:02:52.996 --> 00:02:54.597
Yeah?
Oh, I hear you, player.

65
00:02:54.598 --> 00:02:57.300
So, uh, we are really excited
for you to be here, Carl,

66
00:02:57.301 --> 00:03:00.002
because we have
an announcement to make.

67
00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:01.804
Honey, show him.

68
00:03:02.906 --> 00:03:04.841
There it is.
Deal with it.

69
00:03:04.842 --> 00:03:06.176
We're engaged.

70
00:03:06.177 --> 00:03:08.845
Oh, my God. Come on.
Right?

71
00:03:08.846 --> 00:03:10.079
Big step, huh?

72
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.415
Yeah, it's a big step.
It's a huge one.

73
00:03:12.416 --> 00:03:14.451
Man. Moving fast.
That's okay.

74
00:03:14.452 --> 00:03:16.085
What has it been, six months?

75
00:03:16.086 --> 00:03:18.087
No.
Two years.

76
00:03:18.088 --> 00:03:20.758
Oh, yeah.
That's about right, then.

77
00:03:22.025 --> 00:03:23.226
So anyway, uh,

78
00:03:23.227 --> 00:03:24.927
we're gonna have an,
uh, engagement party

79
00:03:24.928 --> 00:03:26.329
on the 21st. Open bar.

80
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.565
Oh, you bastard.
Always knows how to get me.

81
00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:29.966
Carl, does that work for you?

82
00:03:29.967 --> 00:03:32.169
Yeah, we'll figure it out.

83
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.303
What's there to figure out?

84
00:03:33.304 --> 00:03:34.904
Oh, God, look who's here.

85
00:03:34.905 --> 00:03:37.907
I'm not falling for that, Carl.
What's to figure out?

86
00:03:37.908 --> 00:03:39.209
Open bar.
What's the problem?

87
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.110
I'm serious.
Stephanie's at the bar.

88
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:42.579
The Stephanie?

89
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.482
Yes, my ex-wife.
She's at the bar.

90
00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:48.418
Oh, God, that is Stephanie.

91
00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:49.952
Looks like she's
with someone too.

92
00:03:49.953 --> 00:03:52.589
Yeah. They seem to be thriving.
Good. Good for her.

93
00:03:54.392 --> 00:03:56.025
They're touching
each other's genitals.

94
00:03:56.026 --> 00:03:57.960
Isn't that amazing?
I'm so glad I came out.

95
00:03:57.961 --> 00:04:00.497
Love it. Okay,
you know what? I gotta go.

96
00:04:00.498 --> 00:04:02.865
What? No. No. Carl,
you're gonna stay.

97
00:04:02.866 --> 00:04:05.134
It's been years.
You leave every time she comes.

98
00:04:05.135 --> 00:04:06.336
Totally unrelated.

99
00:04:06.337 --> 00:04:08.205
It has nothing to do
with Stephanie.

100
00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:10.373
Carl. Peter.

101
00:04:10.374 --> 00:04:12.008
Rooney.
Stephanie, guys.

102
00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:13.343
Hey.

103
00:04:13.344 --> 00:04:15.578
My boyfriend, Ted.
Hey.

104
00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.814
I don't believe we...
No, I don't believe we have.

105
00:04:17.815 --> 00:04:18.915
I don't believe we have.

106
00:04:18.916 --> 00:04:20.283
You're leaving?

107
00:04:20.284 --> 00:04:21.618
Yeah, unfortunately.

108
00:04:21.619 --> 00:04:24.254
Terrible timing too,
because you just got here.

109
00:04:24.255 --> 00:04:26.290
You just got here, too, Carl.

110
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.892
Yeah, but he's got a thing.

111
00:04:29.893 --> 00:04:31.160
Yeah, that's a thing.

112
00:04:31.161 --> 00:04:32.862
There's a thing and,
uh, there's no time.

113
00:04:32.863 --> 00:04:36.098
There's a time crunch,
and time is of the essence.

114
00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:40.170
Anyway, I am gone-orrhea.

115
00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.941
Wow. That didn't sound
quite right. Oh, well.

116
00:04:44.942 --> 00:04:46.244
Whoa!

117
00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:57.455
See you, guys.

118
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.975
Hi, Tillie.
Morning, Carl.

119
00:05:18.976 --> 00:05:21.944
Would you like to come over
for a little breakfast?

120
00:05:21.945 --> 00:05:24.146
Oh, gee, that sounds great,
but I can't.

121
00:05:24.147 --> 00:05:26.683
Aw. Some cereal,
a little yogurt?

122
00:05:26.684 --> 00:05:27.950
Yeah, no.

123
00:05:27.951 --> 00:05:29.552
How about some toast, huh?

124
00:05:29.553 --> 00:05:32.922
You know, I have to go
to work, but thanks.

125
00:05:32.923 --> 00:05:35.458
Good show tonight.
Come check us out.

126
00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:37.827
Your loss. Hey, man,
wanna rock out tonight?

127
00:05:37.828 --> 00:05:39.929
Oh, it's you.
Let me guess, no?

128
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.964
Yep.
Yes?

129
00:05:41.965 --> 00:05:44.367
No, I meant yes to your no.

130
00:05:44.368 --> 00:05:46.604
Oh. Yeah, bye.

131
00:05:47.338 --> 00:05:49.138
Persianwifefinder.com.

132
00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:51.774
No, thank you.

133
00:05:51.775 --> 00:05:53.610
Costume party.

134
00:05:53.611 --> 00:05:55.244
Yeah-no.

135
00:05:57.781 --> 00:05:58.916
Oh, boy.

136
00:06:01.285 --> 00:06:02.885
Here we go.

137
00:06:02.886 --> 00:06:05.187
Carl Allen
has reported for duty.

138
00:06:05.188 --> 00:06:06.856
I'm not a soldier, Norman.

139
00:06:06.857 --> 00:06:10.293
You're a soldier
on the front line of finance.

140
00:06:10.294 --> 00:06:13.195
Norman. Line one.

141
00:06:13.196 --> 00:06:15.231
Oh...
Did you wanna get that?

142
00:06:15.232 --> 00:06:16.633
In the privacy of your office?

143
00:06:16.634 --> 00:06:18.335
Oh, I'll just get it here.

144
00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:19.836
Yeah, or that.

145
00:06:19.837 --> 00:06:22.171
You're with Norman.

146
00:06:22.172 --> 00:06:23.272
Uh-huh.

147
00:06:23.273 --> 00:06:25.375
Are you sure? Because...

148
00:06:25.376 --> 00:06:28.010
Okay. Yep. Whatever you say.

149
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:29.480
Okay.

150
00:06:31.482 --> 00:06:33.550
Remember that promotion
we were talking about?

151
00:06:33.551 --> 00:06:35.352
Yeah.
It's not gonna happen.

152
00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:37.387
Tried to fight for you
on the phone there.

153
00:06:37.388 --> 00:06:39.922
It was between you and Demko,
and they went with Demko.

154
00:06:39.923 --> 00:06:40.891
Ah, I don't care.

155
00:06:40.892 --> 00:06:43.360
I didn't really want
the job badly.

156
00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:44.694
I just figured after five years,

157
00:06:44.695 --> 00:06:47.029
I'd be the logical choice,
but whatever.

158
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.297
Hey, look at it this way:

159
00:06:48.298 --> 00:06:49.599
at least you didn't get
shit-canned.

160
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.434
Do you know what that means?

161
00:06:51.435 --> 00:06:53.035
Uh, fired?

162
00:06:53.036 --> 00:06:55.338
Oh, how did you know
what that meant?

163
00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:56.873
Have you heard me
say that before?

164
00:06:56.874 --> 00:06:59.108
No, it's a pretty common
expression.

165
00:06:59.109 --> 00:07:02.211
In my circles.
I made it up.

166
00:07:02.212 --> 00:07:04.881
Well, it's catching on.
Oh, this will cheer you up.

167
00:07:04.882 --> 00:07:07.183
I'm having a little
get-together at my place.

168
00:07:07.184 --> 00:07:09.419
It's a funny hat
and-or wig party.

169
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.455
Oh, man.

170
00:07:12.255 --> 00:07:13.790
Sucks I'm gonna be out of town.

171
00:07:13.791 --> 00:07:15.525
You don't know what day it is.

172
00:07:15.526 --> 00:07:16.526
When is it?

173
00:07:16.527 --> 00:07:17.894
Friday...
I'm out of town.

174
00:07:17.895 --> 00:07:20.162
You spoke at the same time
I did just then.

175
00:07:20.163 --> 00:07:22.599
Like you were committed
to saying what you were saying

176
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.834
regardless of what
I was gonna say.

177
00:07:24.835 --> 00:07:26.068
Hm.

178
00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:27.004
Huh.

179
00:07:27.005 --> 00:07:28.237
I admit,

180
00:07:28.238 --> 00:07:30.106
business has been slow.
I mean, there's a lot

181
00:07:30.107 --> 00:07:32.008
less demand for a small
Rollerblade shop

182
00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:34.811
what with Big 5
and Sport Chalet,

183
00:07:34.812 --> 00:07:36.946
but my designs
are gonna revolutionize

184
00:07:36.947 --> 00:07:39.416
the roller industry.

185
00:07:39.417 --> 00:07:41.518
I know that, Marv, but, uh,

186
00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:42.652
you have no equity.

187
00:07:42.653 --> 00:07:44.687
None. And
your credit...

188
00:07:44.688 --> 00:07:46.789
Bad, but I don't wanna
sound desperate.

189
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:47.758
Yeah.

190
00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.959
I have no other options left.

191
00:08:00.571 --> 00:08:03.506
Carl. Hey.
Long time no see.

192
00:08:03.507 --> 00:08:05.307
Nick Lane?

193
00:08:05.308 --> 00:08:06.509
Hey.

194
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.445
You don't still work
at the bank, do you?

195
00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:09.612
Yeah.

196
00:08:09.613 --> 00:08:11.013
Kind of why I'm sitting
outside here,

197
00:08:11.014 --> 00:08:12.749
eating my lunch,
wearing the nametag.

198
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.850
Huh.

199
00:08:13.851 --> 00:08:16.018
You must be running
this place by now.

200
00:08:16.019 --> 00:08:18.455
I could have.
Had a couple offers.

201
00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:19.756
Didn't wanna get tied down.

202
00:08:19.757 --> 00:08:21.424
How's Stephanie?
Good.

203
00:08:21.425 --> 00:08:23.626
God.

204
00:08:23.627 --> 00:08:25.327
She's good.

205
00:08:25.328 --> 00:08:26.896
What have you been doing?
Oh.

206
00:08:26.897 --> 00:08:29.666
I've been all over the map,
man. I've lived.

207
00:08:29.667 --> 00:08:31.501
I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.

208
00:08:31.502 --> 00:08:33.436
I ate bat in Laos.

209
00:08:33.437 --> 00:08:35.004
I shot a cow with a bazooka.

210
00:08:35.005 --> 00:08:36.673
I'm not proud of that last one,

211
00:08:36.674 --> 00:08:38.340
but I did it, man.

212
00:08:38.341 --> 00:08:40.276
Wow. Sounds wild.

213
00:08:40.277 --> 00:08:41.745
Wanna know my secret?

214
00:08:42.546 --> 00:08:43.880
I'm a yes man.

215
00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:47.083
The word "yes"
has changed my life. Here.

216
00:08:47.084 --> 00:08:48.818
No, thanks. I'm fine.

217
00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:50.953
"Fine?" I wipe my ass
with "fine."

218
00:08:50.954 --> 00:08:52.622
Wow. Okay.

219
00:08:52.623 --> 00:08:55.291
You don't wanna work here, Carl.

220
00:08:55.292 --> 00:08:57.494
Yeah, I do.

221
00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:58.961
No, you don't.

222
00:09:00.531 --> 00:09:02.064
Why don't you take this rock

223
00:09:02.065 --> 00:09:05.502
throw it at that bank
and shatter the window?

224
00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:08.638
No, thanks.
Then ask me if I want to.

225
00:09:08.639 --> 00:09:10.372
Do you wanna throw
that rock at the bank?

226
00:09:10.373 --> 00:09:11.642
Yes.

227
00:09:12.442 --> 00:09:14.577
Oh, my God.

228
00:09:14.578 --> 00:09:16.879
What are you, nuts?
Go to the seminar, Carl.

229
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.481
You stay right there.

230
00:09:18.482 --> 00:09:20.651
He's gonna break.
Stop!

231
00:09:24.655 --> 00:09:27.056
Carl, live your life!

232
00:09:27.057 --> 00:09:28.891
You won't regret it.

233
00:09:28.892 --> 00:09:32.394
Hey, stop. Stop!

234
00:09:41.772 --> 00:09:43.139
I know you wanna see my band.

235
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.907
No.

236
00:09:44.908 --> 00:09:46.075
Sorry.

237
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.612
Hello?
Stephanie?

238
00:09:49.613 --> 00:09:52.214
Carl.
Yeah, it's me.

239
00:09:52.215 --> 00:09:53.750
Just felt like calling you.

240
00:09:53.751 --> 00:09:56.452
I was missing you,
I guess. Weird, huh?

241
00:09:56.453 --> 00:09:58.420
Yes, Carl.
I have to go.

242
00:09:58.421 --> 00:10:00.189
Ted and I are taking
a little boat ride.

243
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:01.691
Oh, that's great.

244
00:10:01.692 --> 00:10:04.027
Good for you. Good for you.

245
00:10:15.105 --> 00:10:18.876
Jesus, Pete.
I'm not in or I'm busy.

246
00:10:25.015 --> 00:10:26.716
Oh, come on.
You're halfway through,

247
00:10:26.717 --> 00:10:28.718
just snap it off already.

248
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.227
Pete? Hey.

249
00:10:38.228 --> 00:10:39.129
Where you been?

250
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:40.830
You not been getting my calls?

251
00:10:40.831 --> 00:10:42.298
What?

252
00:10:42.299 --> 00:10:43.465
God, no.

253
00:10:43.466 --> 00:10:45.267
Oh, I totally lost my phone.

254
00:10:45.268 --> 00:10:47.003
You're so full of shit.

255
00:10:47.004 --> 00:10:50.239
Here it is.

256
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.540
Yeah. There it is.

257
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:52.775
You know what, buddy?

258
00:10:52.776 --> 00:10:54.510
You missed my engagement
party tonight.

259
00:10:54.511 --> 00:10:57.313
Oh, no. Oh, shoot,
you're kidding.

260
00:10:57.314 --> 00:10:58.314
That was tonight?

261
00:10:58.315 --> 00:11:00.216
Mm-hm.
I'm so sorry, man.

262
00:11:00.217 --> 00:11:01.483
I totally gapped it.

263
00:11:01.484 --> 00:11:04.420
Listen, I'll make it up to you.
I promise. I swear.

264
00:11:04.421 --> 00:11:05.822
You pick the day,
any day you want,

265
00:11:05.823 --> 00:11:07.456
we'll go out, we'll swashbuckle.

266
00:11:07.457 --> 00:11:08.692
What does that even mean?

267
00:11:09.326 --> 00:11:10.559
I don't know.

268
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.028
This wasn't drinks
at a bar, Carl.

269
00:11:12.029 --> 00:11:14.030
This was my engagement party.

270
00:11:14.031 --> 00:11:15.297
You only get married once.

271
00:11:15.298 --> 00:11:17.366
Well, I certainly
wouldn't do it again.

272
00:11:17.367 --> 00:11:18.567
I know, Carl.

273
00:11:18.568 --> 00:11:19.869
I know that Stephanie left you,

274
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:21.771
and I know that you have
issues because of it,

275
00:11:21.772 --> 00:11:24.106
but this isn't about you.
It's about me.

276
00:11:24.107 --> 00:11:26.542
When's the last time
you did anything fun?

277
00:11:26.543 --> 00:11:28.044
You're always making excuses.

278
00:11:28.045 --> 00:11:30.346
"I don't wanna commit.
I don't wanna be tied down."

279
00:11:30.347 --> 00:11:32.548
I mean, do you even know
my fiancÐÂ©e's last name?

280
00:11:32.549 --> 00:11:34.450
Yeah. Fisher.

281
00:11:34.451 --> 00:11:36.152
Fishman.

282
00:11:36.153 --> 00:11:38.688
Wait. Fishwall?

283
00:11:38.689 --> 00:11:40.289
"Fishwall"?

284
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.792
You think her name's
"Lucy Fishwall"?

285
00:11:42.793 --> 00:11:44.761
No? That's wrong?
It's Burns.

286
00:11:44.762 --> 00:11:48.164
"Burns"?
It's Lucy Burns, Carl.

287
00:11:48.165 --> 00:11:49.198
And guess what?

288
00:11:49.199 --> 00:11:50.867
She doesn't like my best friend.

289
00:11:50.868 --> 00:11:53.269
I keep trying to think
of reasons why she should,

290
00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.470
but you know what?

291
00:11:54.471 --> 00:11:55.972
I can't think of any.
Pete, I...

292
00:11:55.973 --> 00:11:58.340
I don't wanna hear
another excuse, Carl. Jesus.

293
00:11:58.341 --> 00:11:59.942
You do whatever you want.

294
00:11:59.943 --> 00:12:02.044
I'm just telling you,
you don't change your life,

295
00:12:02.045 --> 00:12:03.545
you're gonna end up
a lonely guy.

296
00:12:03.546 --> 00:12:04.781
A lonely guy, Carl.

297
00:12:04.782 --> 00:12:08.251
Lonely guy.

298
00:12:13.623 --> 00:12:15.392
Hey, Carl.

299
00:12:19.029 --> 00:12:21.198
Hey, Rooney,
come here for a second.

300
00:12:23.967 --> 00:12:25.868
Carl look a little odd to you?

301
00:12:25.869 --> 00:12:28.772
Is it me, or does it look
like he's kind of dead?

302
00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:30.707
Nope.

303
00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:32.408
No more than usual.

304
00:12:32.409 --> 00:12:33.609
I don't know.

305
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.044
I'm kind of leaning
towards thinking

306
00:12:35.045 --> 00:12:36.378
he might actually be dead.

307
00:12:38.081 --> 00:12:39.548
I guess I
never saw him a lot,

308
00:12:39.549 --> 00:12:41.851
so it's hard for me
to tell the difference.

309
00:12:41.852 --> 00:12:44.453
Yeah, that's true.

310
00:12:44.454 --> 00:12:46.155
He never did much.

311
00:12:46.156 --> 00:12:47.757
Wasn't a good friend.
Nope.

312
00:12:47.758 --> 00:12:50.259
Wasn't a good anything.

313
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.328
Are there more beers
in the fridge?

314
00:12:52.329 --> 00:12:54.997
Oh, sorry, last one.

315
00:12:54.998 --> 00:12:56.933
Now, that's upsetting.

316
00:13:02.372 --> 00:13:04.341
What was that?

317
00:13:46.249 --> 00:13:48.751
Welcome to yes.

318
00:13:48.752 --> 00:13:51.520
We are about to begin.

319
00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:54.590
Please, find a seat.

320
00:13:54.591 --> 00:13:55.925
Carl?

321
00:13:55.926 --> 00:13:57.760
Hey, Carl.
Psst.

322
00:13:57.761 --> 00:13:59.528
Carl, man, hey.
Oh.

323
00:13:59.529 --> 00:14:01.730
Carl. Ha-ha.
Hey, Nick.

324
00:14:01.731 --> 00:14:03.132
You made it, man.

325
00:14:03.133 --> 00:14:05.034
Oh, did you wanna...?
Sure, let me sit down.

326
00:14:05.035 --> 00:14:06.502
I knew you'd come.

327
00:14:06.503 --> 00:14:07.937
I saw it in your eyes, man.

328
00:14:07.938 --> 00:14:10.306
You're gonna love this.
Terrence is a genius.

329
00:14:10.307 --> 00:14:12.608
He's gonna blow your mind
all over the room.

330
00:14:12.609 --> 00:14:14.676
He's like a freaking
mind grenade.

331
00:14:14.677 --> 00:14:15.812
I'm not sure I want that.

332
00:14:15.813 --> 00:14:17.179
Yeah, but you need it.

333
00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.480
That's why you're here.

334
00:14:18.481 --> 00:14:20.682
You have got to start
saying yes, my man,

335
00:14:20.683 --> 00:14:22.518
and I mean to everything.

336
00:14:22.519 --> 00:14:24.855
Shh.
It's starting.

337
00:14:25.555 --> 00:14:27.456
Life.

338
00:14:27.457 --> 00:14:29.959
We are all living it.

339
00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.260
Or are we?

340
00:14:31.261 --> 00:14:32.528
Ooh, heavy.

341
00:14:32.529 --> 00:14:35.731
Change is generated
from consciousness,

342
00:14:35.732 --> 00:14:39.135
but where is consciousness
generated from?

343
00:14:39.136 --> 00:14:41.370
From the external.

344
00:14:41.371 --> 00:14:43.339
And how do we control
the external?

345
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.774
With one word.

346
00:14:45.775 --> 00:14:47.844
And what is that word?

347
00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:50.312
Yes!
Oh, jeez.

348
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:56.253
Yes.

349
00:14:57.921 --> 00:14:59.957
Yes, yes, yes!
Yes. Yes!

350
00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:08.365
Yes!
Whoo!

351
00:15:09.032 --> 00:15:11.233
The word is "yes."

352
00:15:11.234 --> 00:15:14.304
Yes, yes, yes.

353
00:15:15.138 --> 00:15:17.639
Say it a million times.
Yes.

354
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.308
Say it a million more times.

355
00:15:19.309 --> 00:15:22.879
And the word you will have
said two million times is:

356
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.747
Yes!

357
00:15:31.989 --> 00:15:33.189
Yes!

358
00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:36.592
I want you to invite yes

359
00:15:36.593 --> 00:15:38.294
into your lives,

360
00:15:38.295 --> 00:15:43.466
because it will RSVP "yes."

361
00:15:44.201 --> 00:15:46.702
When you say yes to things,

362
00:15:46.703 --> 00:15:49.305
you embrace the possible.

363
00:15:49.306 --> 00:15:52.841
You gobble up all
of life's energies,

364
00:15:52.842 --> 00:15:56.246
and you excrete the waste.

365
00:15:56.947 --> 00:15:59.448
Before we begin today,

366
00:15:59.449 --> 00:16:02.519
I'd like to welcome
our new members.

367
00:16:05.188 --> 00:16:07.056
Who among you is new?

368
00:16:07.057 --> 00:16:08.190
He is.

369
00:16:08.191 --> 00:16:10.292
This guy right here.
He's new.

370
00:16:10.293 --> 00:16:12.728
Over here.
Please don't... Jesus.

371
00:16:12.729 --> 00:16:15.998
Come on up, future yes man.

372
00:16:15.999 --> 00:16:16.999
Uh, that's okay,

373
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.500
I'm just auditing.

374
00:16:22.339 --> 00:16:24.941
You can't audit life, my friend.

375
00:16:24.942 --> 00:16:26.742
Now, get on up here.

376
00:16:26.743 --> 00:16:28.810
No, thanks.
I'm cool.

377
00:16:28.811 --> 00:16:29.946
I'm sorry?

378
00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:32.614
What was that you said?

379
00:16:32.615 --> 00:16:33.749
Uh.

380
00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:36.352
I said, I'm cool.

381
00:16:36.353 --> 00:16:38.088
Before that.

382
00:16:39.589 --> 00:16:40.923
Thank you.

383
00:16:40.924 --> 00:16:44.093
Back up just a little bit more.

384
00:16:44.094 --> 00:16:47.063
No.
No man. No man.

385
00:16:47.064 --> 00:16:49.231
No man. No man. No man.

386
00:16:49.232 --> 00:16:50.732
No man. No man.

387
00:16:50.733 --> 00:16:52.201
Okay.

388
00:16:52.202 --> 00:16:55.004
No man. No man.

389
00:16:55.005 --> 00:16:57.506
If the molehill
won't come to Terrence,

390
00:16:57.507 --> 00:17:00.310
Terrence will come
to the molehill.

391
00:17:09.219 --> 00:17:10.587
What's your name?

392
00:17:12.322 --> 00:17:13.922
Carl.

393
00:17:13.923 --> 00:17:15.424
Let me guess, Carl.

394
00:17:15.425 --> 00:17:18.294
Someone talked you into coming
here today, didn't they?

395
00:17:18.295 --> 00:17:20.129
Yes.

396
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:21.998
Yes!

397
00:17:21.999 --> 00:17:25.901
And you're not sure
about this, are you?

398
00:17:25.902 --> 00:17:27.136
No.

399
00:17:27.137 --> 00:17:31.840
No man. No man.

400
00:17:31.841 --> 00:17:34.143
You're dead, Carl.

401
00:17:34.144 --> 00:17:37.546
You say no to life,
and therefore you're not living.

402
00:17:37.547 --> 00:17:40.882
You make up excuses
to the people around you

403
00:17:40.883 --> 00:17:42.318
and to yourself.

404
00:17:42.319 --> 00:17:44.720
You're stuck
in the same dead-end job.

405
00:17:44.721 --> 00:17:46.255
You have been for years.

406
00:17:46.256 --> 00:17:47.689
You don't have a girlfriend,

407
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:50.692
you don't have anything
close to a girlfriend,

408
00:17:50.693 --> 00:17:52.928
and you lost the love
of your life

409
00:17:52.929 --> 00:17:54.630
because she couldn't
be with someone

410
00:17:54.631 --> 00:17:56.233
who didn't live theirs.

411
00:17:57.634 --> 00:17:59.301
Wow.

412
00:17:59.302 --> 00:18:01.103
And on most nights
you're so bored

413
00:18:01.104 --> 00:18:03.905
and filled with ennui

414
00:18:03.906 --> 00:18:06.575
you can't even summon
the enthusiasm

415
00:18:06.576 --> 00:18:08.378
necessary to masturbate.

416
00:18:09.079 --> 00:18:10.279
Am I right, Carl?

417
00:18:13.983 --> 00:18:15.417
Um.

418
00:18:15.418 --> 00:18:19.389
I have had some trouble.

419
00:18:25.462 --> 00:18:28.164
We're gonna make
a covenant, Carl.

420
00:18:28.165 --> 00:18:29.365
Yes.

421
00:18:29.366 --> 00:18:31.667
Do you want to make a covenant?

422
00:18:31.668 --> 00:18:32.868
Uh...

423
00:18:34.171 --> 00:18:35.937
The word is "yes," Carl.

424
00:18:35.938 --> 00:18:38.440
Yes!
Yes.

425
00:18:38.441 --> 00:18:40.142
Yes!

426
00:18:40.143 --> 00:18:43.579
Once you leave this building,

427
00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.949
every time an opportunity
presents itself,

428
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:50.286
no matter what it is,

429
00:18:50.287 --> 00:18:52.688
you will say yes.

430
00:18:52.689 --> 00:18:53.889
Yes!
Yes.

431
00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:55.724
Yes. Yes.
Yes!

432
00:18:55.725 --> 00:18:58.061
Yes.
Yes.

433
00:18:58.828 --> 00:19:00.697
Okay, what if I...

434
00:19:01.898 --> 00:19:03.899
say...

435
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.235
the other word?

436
00:19:06.236 --> 00:19:09.338
You'll be making
a promise to yourself.

437
00:19:09.339 --> 00:19:13.509
And when you break
a promise to yourself,

438
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:17.079
things can get a little dicey.

439
00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.048
What do you say, Carl?

440
00:19:20.049 --> 00:19:23.452
Are you ready
to make a covenant?

441
00:19:23.453 --> 00:19:25.321
Come on, Carl.
Yes.

442
00:19:25.322 --> 00:19:26.822
Yes.
Yes.

443
00:19:26.823 --> 00:19:27.823
Yes.

444
00:19:27.824 --> 00:19:29.125
Again.

445
00:19:29.126 --> 00:19:30.626
Yes.
Yes.

446
00:19:30.627 --> 00:19:32.628
Say it again. Yes! Yes!

447
00:19:34.431 --> 00:19:36.598
Make me believe it.

448
00:19:36.599 --> 00:19:38.601
Yes, yes, yes.

449
00:19:42.339 --> 00:19:43.339
Yes!

450
00:20:11.934 --> 00:20:13.235
Hey, there he is.

451
00:20:13.236 --> 00:20:15.137
Hey, that was really wonderful.
Oh, thank you.

452
00:20:15.138 --> 00:20:16.505
Pretty powerful stuff, huh?

453
00:20:16.506 --> 00:20:19.074
Hey. Good to have you with us.
Yes.

454
00:20:19.075 --> 00:20:21.042
So are you gonna do it?

455
00:20:21.043 --> 00:20:22.678
I don't know. Maybe.

456
00:20:22.679 --> 00:20:24.180
That's weird.
I didn't realize

457
00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:26.148
we just stepped out
of a "maybe" seminar.

458
00:20:28.918 --> 00:20:30.719
Hey, man.

459
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.388
That's a nice car.

460
00:20:32.389 --> 00:20:36.193
Could...? Could you drive
me to Elysian Park?

461
00:20:36.793 --> 00:20:38.794
Oh, uh...

462
00:20:38.795 --> 00:20:40.397
Yes!

463
00:20:40.997 --> 00:20:43.932
Sure he can.
Right, Carl?

464
00:20:43.933 --> 00:20:45.468
Uh...

465
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:49.238
Yeah, why not?

466
00:20:49.239 --> 00:20:51.807
Ha-ha-ha. Yes.

467
00:20:51.808 --> 00:20:53.843
You won't regret this, Carl.

468
00:20:59.081 --> 00:21:01.283
Can-can I use
your phone?

469
00:21:01.284 --> 00:21:03.786
Go, man, go.

470
00:21:32.482 --> 00:21:34.716
Keep going or this'll do,

471
00:21:34.717 --> 00:21:36.318
because it doesn't
really matter?

472
00:21:36.319 --> 00:21:38.620
Yeah, hold on a sec,
I can't hear myself think.

473
00:21:38.621 --> 00:21:42.324
It's just a little further, man.
Just right up the hill there.

474
00:21:42.325 --> 00:21:43.325
Go ahead.

475
00:21:45.328 --> 00:21:47.497
And what did you say?

476
00:21:48.431 --> 00:21:51.267
Oh, I'm-I'm just
right over here.

477
00:21:51.268 --> 00:21:54.236
Okay. Yeah.

478
00:21:54.237 --> 00:21:56.372
What? Hello? Hello?

479
00:21:56.373 --> 00:21:59.641
Oh, shit, man.
Your battery's dead.

480
00:21:59.642 --> 00:22:01.378
Oh, great.

481
00:22:02.379 --> 00:22:04.380
Thanks.
Well,

482
00:22:04.381 --> 00:22:06.482
gracias, amigo.

483
00:22:06.483 --> 00:22:08.450
I mean, it's real nice
of you to give me a ride.

484
00:22:08.451 --> 00:22:10.185
Most people just say no.

485
00:22:10.186 --> 00:22:11.587
Course, I have been having

486
00:22:11.588 --> 00:22:14.055
a lot of luck lately
outside of that hotel.

487
00:22:14.056 --> 00:22:16.625
No problem. Have a good night.

488
00:22:16.626 --> 00:22:17.494
Oh.

489
00:22:17.495 --> 00:22:19.762
Can I borrow a couple bucks?

490
00:22:21.931 --> 00:22:23.232
Okay.

491
00:22:24.133 --> 00:22:26.369
I've come this far.

492
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:29.738
Yes, you can.

493
00:22:29.739 --> 00:22:32.908
You got a whole lot there.
Can I have it all?

494
00:22:38.381 --> 00:22:39.415
Sure.

495
00:22:39.416 --> 00:22:41.951
It's all yours.

496
00:22:44.821 --> 00:22:45.955
God bless you, man.

497
00:23:08.478 --> 00:23:10.479
Oh, come on.

498
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.749
Come on, come on.

499
00:23:17.354 --> 00:23:18.955
Perfect.

500
00:23:19.689 --> 00:23:21.623
Hey, Carl.
Do you wanna give

501
00:23:21.624 --> 00:23:23.325
all your money away
to a homeless guy?

502
00:23:23.326 --> 00:23:24.793
Yes, yes, I do.

503
00:23:24.794 --> 00:23:26.628
How about letting him
burn out your phone

504
00:23:26.629 --> 00:23:28.296
so you can't call AAA
when you run out of gas?

505
00:23:28.297 --> 00:23:31.700
You know what? That sounds
like a fucking great idea!

506
00:23:31.701 --> 00:23:34.436
Why don't you take a late-night
stroll through the hills

507
00:23:34.437 --> 00:23:36.438
and get killed
by the Manson family?

508
00:23:36.439 --> 00:23:38.508
Don't mind if I do.

509
00:23:55.458 --> 00:23:57.527
Come on, man.

510
00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:01.430
Yes. Since that's my only...

511
00:24:01.431 --> 00:24:03.600
fucking option.

512
00:24:19.081 --> 00:24:21.417
Would you like to carry
a 20-pound container of gas

513
00:24:21.418 --> 00:24:23.419
up a giant hill to your car?

514
00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.854
Oh, could I?
Could I really?

515
00:24:28.024 --> 00:24:29.758
That's a good look.

516
00:24:29.759 --> 00:24:31.359
Oh.

517
00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.995
Hi. Did you just
take my picture?

518
00:24:33.996 --> 00:24:35.097
Maybe.

519
00:24:36.098 --> 00:24:38.400
Did you just run out of gas?

520
00:24:38.401 --> 00:24:40.369
Maybe.

521
00:24:41.604 --> 00:24:43.304
That sucks.

522
00:24:43.305 --> 00:24:45.707
That happened to me last week.

523
00:24:45.708 --> 00:24:47.242
When you were driving
out of your way

524
00:24:47.243 --> 00:24:49.511
to drop off a homeless guy
who wore out your battery

525
00:24:49.512 --> 00:24:51.212
so you couldn't call AAA?

526
00:24:51.213 --> 00:24:52.648
Uh, no.

527
00:24:52.649 --> 00:24:54.282
I take it that's
what happened to you.

528
00:24:54.283 --> 00:24:55.383
No.

529
00:24:55.384 --> 00:24:57.386
Why would you assume that?

530
00:24:59.088 --> 00:25:00.456
He used up your phone?

531
00:25:00.457 --> 00:25:01.957
Yeah.
Apparently he was

532
00:25:01.958 --> 00:25:04.460
the most popular
homeless man on the planet.

533
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:05.527
He was staying connected.

534
00:25:05.528 --> 00:25:07.162
It was good to see.

535
00:25:07.163 --> 00:25:10.499
I'm just glad that I could
be a part of it, really.

536
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:11.633
That must feel good.

537
00:25:11.634 --> 00:25:13.134
Oh, truly, truly.

538
00:25:13.135 --> 00:25:15.036
Yeah, and I'm getting
some exercise,

539
00:25:15.037 --> 00:25:16.071
which is cool.

540
00:25:16.072 --> 00:25:18.541
Well, do you need a ride?

541
00:25:19.308 --> 00:25:21.076
On that thing?

542
00:25:31.521 --> 00:25:33.955
Am I going too fast for you?

543
00:25:33.956 --> 00:25:35.056
No.

544
00:25:35.057 --> 00:25:36.825
In fact, I think
you should go faster.

545
00:25:36.826 --> 00:25:39.761
That way if we crash,
at least I'll die.

546
00:25:39.762 --> 00:25:42.898
I just don't wanna
be kept alive artificially.

547
00:25:42.899 --> 00:25:44.033
Whoa!

548
00:25:52.074 --> 00:25:53.374
What are you doing?

549
00:25:53.375 --> 00:25:56.445
I'm taking a picture.
Smile.

550
00:25:57.947 --> 00:25:59.648
I can't see.
I'm blind.

551
00:25:59.649 --> 00:26:01.783
Me too.
Isn't it great?

552
00:26:01.784 --> 00:26:04.520
Whoo-hoo!

553
00:26:14.997 --> 00:26:17.465
Yeah, that's getting it good.

554
00:26:17.466 --> 00:26:19.468
Yep.

555
00:26:21.103 --> 00:26:22.571
Well, thanks again for the ride.

556
00:26:22.572 --> 00:26:23.772
No problem.

557
00:26:23.773 --> 00:26:25.073
Hopefully the color will return

558
00:26:25.074 --> 00:26:27.108
to your face sometime soon.

559
00:26:27.109 --> 00:26:29.144
I'm more of a four-wheel
kind of guy.

560
00:26:29.145 --> 00:26:30.411
Really?

561
00:26:30.412 --> 00:26:31.713
I never would have guessed that.

562
00:26:31.714 --> 00:26:34.150
You seemed so at ease on two.

563
00:26:35.785 --> 00:26:37.719
Can I have my helmet back now?

564
00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.955
I'm still wearing it, aren't I?

565
00:26:39.956 --> 00:26:41.190
Yeah.

566
00:26:42.491 --> 00:26:44.093
Thanks.

567
00:26:45.461 --> 00:26:46.728
So, uh, you okay?

568
00:26:46.729 --> 00:26:48.096
Yeah, I'm good,

569
00:26:48.097 --> 00:26:50.231
unless you wanna
stick around and make out.

570
00:26:50.232 --> 00:26:53.536
What?
What did you say?

571
00:26:56.072 --> 00:26:57.506
Hey, I...

572
00:27:03.312 --> 00:27:05.514
Have a good night.

573
00:27:30.573 --> 00:27:32.340
Yes.

574
00:27:40.817 --> 00:27:43.686
"Yes always leads
to something good."

575
00:27:47.423 --> 00:27:49.725
"Never avoid opportunities.

576
00:27:49.726 --> 00:27:51.492
They may come in any form."

577
00:27:56.198 --> 00:27:57.232
Hello?

578
00:27:57.233 --> 00:27:59.534
Carl, it's your buddy Norman.

579
00:27:59.535 --> 00:28:02.337
Well, and your boss,
but more buddy than boss, right?

580
00:28:02.338 --> 00:28:04.907
I guess.

581
00:28:06.042 --> 00:28:08.844
So look, uh, we're kind
of short on Saturday staff.

582
00:28:08.845 --> 00:28:10.880
Is there any way
you could come in?

583
00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.914
Sure.

584
00:28:12.915 --> 00:28:14.883
Nothing I like better
than the inside of a bank

585
00:28:14.884 --> 00:28:16.417
on a beautiful Saturday.

586
00:28:16.418 --> 00:28:18.654
Yeah. Yeah, there really
is something magical

587
00:28:18.655 --> 00:28:21.122
about this place.

588
00:28:24.927 --> 00:28:28.698
Would I like to increase
the size of my penis?

589
00:28:29.565 --> 00:28:31.399
Right.

590
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.770
Like I need that.

591
00:28:37.406 --> 00:28:39.340
Persianwifefinder.

592
00:28:39.341 --> 00:28:42.811
Hi there. I am Faranoush.

593
00:28:42.812 --> 00:28:45.546
Would you be the man for me?

594
00:28:45.547 --> 00:28:47.683
I guess so.

595
00:28:47.684 --> 00:28:49.217
Excuse me.

596
00:28:49.218 --> 00:28:51.853
I'd like to apply
for a small-business loan.

597
00:28:51.854 --> 00:28:53.354
And what's your business?

598
00:28:53.355 --> 00:28:56.892
I bake cakes in the shape
of different celebrities' faces.

599
00:28:56.893 --> 00:28:59.761
Oh, wow.
Mickey Rourke.

600
00:28:59.762 --> 00:29:01.396
No. It's Bono.

601
00:29:01.397 --> 00:29:03.031
Oh.

602
00:29:03.032 --> 00:29:04.399
Yeah, right.

603
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.036
Let's hope it doesn't taste
like Mickey Rourke. Bleh.

604
00:29:08.237 --> 00:29:09.637
So what do you think?

605
00:29:09.638 --> 00:29:12.774
Uh...

606
00:29:12.775 --> 00:29:14.777
I think yes.

607
00:29:19.648 --> 00:29:21.416
Inta-ma-resting.

608
00:29:21.417 --> 00:29:23.351
Cakes, huh?

609
00:29:23.352 --> 00:29:24.954
Yeah. I just kind of...

610
00:29:25.722 --> 00:29:27.588
went with my gut on it, Norm.

611
00:29:27.589 --> 00:29:29.290
You called me "Norm."

612
00:29:29.291 --> 00:29:30.259
Yeah.

613
00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.160
Could that, like,
be my nickname?

614
00:29:32.161 --> 00:29:34.195
Yeah. I guess.

615
00:29:34.196 --> 00:29:35.363
Oh, nice.

616
00:29:35.364 --> 00:29:37.665
I like your style, Car.

617
00:29:37.666 --> 00:29:39.034
That could be yours.

618
00:29:39.035 --> 00:29:41.469
Yeah. Carl's pretty short
already, but...

619
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:43.739
But it's the kind of dazzle
we need around here.

620
00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.606
Yeah.
And you know what I did?

621
00:29:45.607 --> 00:29:46.942
What?
That whole Demko thing

622
00:29:46.943 --> 00:29:48.309
really chapped my ass.

623
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.346
I marched upstairs
and I told the big guns:

624
00:29:51.347 --> 00:29:53.782
"Carl gets promoted
in lieu of Demko,

625
00:29:53.783 --> 00:29:56.484
"or along with Demko, whichever,

626
00:29:56.485 --> 00:29:57.853
or I walk."

627
00:29:57.854 --> 00:30:00.188
Really? What did they say?

628
00:30:00.189 --> 00:30:02.758
Well, they were quite attracted
to the me walking option,

629
00:30:02.759 --> 00:30:04.059
you know, for a moment,

630
00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.761
but then I threw
that off the table.

631
00:30:05.762 --> 00:30:07.062
Good move.
And they said

632
00:30:07.063 --> 00:30:08.930
if you started to show
some initiative,

633
00:30:08.931 --> 00:30:10.399
I could promote you.

634
00:30:11.067 --> 00:30:12.167
And?

635
00:30:12.168 --> 00:30:13.701
Well, you're doing it.
Yeah?

636
00:30:13.702 --> 00:30:15.636
Yeah, the whole cake thing.
Yeah.

637
00:30:15.637 --> 00:30:17.372
You're making up nicknames.
Okay.

638
00:30:17.373 --> 00:30:19.240
You know what?
I called Demko this morning

639
00:30:19.241 --> 00:30:20.809
to ask if he could work
on Saturday,

640
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:21.977
and do you know what he said?

641
00:30:21.978 --> 00:30:24.479
No.
Oh, how did you know that?

642
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.713
He's not here.

643
00:30:25.714 --> 00:30:28.049
Yeah, but you are, Car.
Yeah.

644
00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:31.186
And that's why I'm gonna
give the job to you.

645
00:30:31.187 --> 00:30:34.923
Norm, that's amazing.
Oh, my God. Thank you.

646
00:30:34.924 --> 00:30:36.925
Nice little raise
in it for you too.

647
00:30:36.926 --> 00:30:39.094
Bump up your salary to 65.

648
00:30:39.095 --> 00:30:42.097
Thousand?
Of course, thousand.

649
00:30:42.098 --> 00:30:44.733
Come on, let's step this
thing up a notch, Broseph.

650
00:30:46.903 --> 00:30:48.203
See what I did there?

651
00:30:48.204 --> 00:30:51.306
I joined "bro"
with "Joseph." Broseph.

652
00:30:51.307 --> 00:30:53.909
Pretty cool, huh?

653
00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:56.277
Very cool, Norm.

654
00:30:59.681 --> 00:31:03.018
I have been such a dick
and a douche.

655
00:31:03.019 --> 00:31:05.453
More of a douche
than a dick, probably,

656
00:31:05.454 --> 00:31:07.488
but I'm sorry.
I should have been there.

657
00:31:07.489 --> 00:31:08.689
I mean, really.

658
00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:10.091
You're preaching
to the choir, Carl.

659
00:31:10.092 --> 00:31:11.126
I'm telling you, man,

660
00:31:11.127 --> 00:31:13.661
things are different.

661
00:31:13.662 --> 00:31:16.297
Okay. Wait, so wait. You have
to say yes to everything?

662
00:31:16.298 --> 00:31:17.099
Yeah, exactly.

663
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.333
It's like you said:

664
00:31:18.334 --> 00:31:19.935
I wasn't open to stuff,
and now I am,

665
00:31:19.936 --> 00:31:21.536
and things are changing for me.

666
00:31:21.537 --> 00:31:24.672
It's like the era
of yes has begun.

667
00:31:24.673 --> 00:31:27.275
All right. Look, gets you out
of the house, I'm all for it.

668
00:31:27.276 --> 00:31:29.744
Excuse me. Could we get
another round of drinks?

669
00:31:29.745 --> 00:31:31.847
And actually,
we're gonna start a tab,

670
00:31:31.848 --> 00:31:33.714
and our good friend here,
Carl Allen,

671
00:31:33.715 --> 00:31:35.051
will be taking care of it.

672
00:31:36.318 --> 00:31:38.653
Well, you're okay with that,
right, buddy?

673
00:31:38.654 --> 00:31:41.356
Yes. Yes, I am.

674
00:31:41.357 --> 00:31:42.925
Okay.

675
00:31:46.028 --> 00:31:48.663
I should be prepping
my case for Monday,

676
00:31:48.664 --> 00:31:51.132
but I cannot miss this.

677
00:31:51.133 --> 00:31:53.836
Hey, you,
another bump of hot sauce.

678
00:31:55.872 --> 00:31:59.475
Boy, you guys are really
into this yes thing.

679
00:32:08.417 --> 00:32:10.219
Okay, okay.

680
00:32:30.372 --> 00:32:31.540
He did it.

681
00:32:40.883 --> 00:32:43.551
Drinks on me.

682
00:32:43.552 --> 00:32:45.954
Crazy, man.

683
00:32:45.955 --> 00:32:47.788
Carl, that was so awesome.

684
00:32:47.789 --> 00:32:50.358
Okay.
Excuse me. Could I...

685
00:32:50.359 --> 00:32:52.293
Absolutely.

686
00:32:52.294 --> 00:32:55.597
I don't think that's what she
was asking for, but all right.

687
00:32:59.335 --> 00:33:01.536
Was I chewing gum before?

688
00:33:01.537 --> 00:33:04.205
Hey. What do you think you're
doing, asshole?

689
00:33:04.206 --> 00:33:07.008
Whoa. Easy, easy. It was
a little misunderstanding, okay?

690
00:33:07.009 --> 00:33:09.877
I'm just saying yes
to life, homes.

691
00:33:09.878 --> 00:33:12.680
You gotta say yes to life.

692
00:33:12.681 --> 00:33:15.051
I made a sacred "conevant."

693
00:33:15.851 --> 00:33:18.954
That sounded naughty.

694
00:33:18.955 --> 00:33:20.421
I think you and I
need to step outside.

695
00:33:20.422 --> 00:33:22.757
No. God, no.
Okay, it's okay.

696
00:33:22.758 --> 00:33:24.926
I got this. I got this.

697
00:33:24.927 --> 00:33:27.728
Okay, but if I win,

698
00:33:27.729 --> 00:33:32.033
I get to take that pretty girl
of yours to a ball,

699
00:33:32.034 --> 00:33:34.435
because she deserves that.

700
00:33:34.436 --> 00:33:38.073
Every pretty girl
deserves to go to a ball.

701
00:33:38.074 --> 00:33:41.043
That is so nice.

702
00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.948
Oh, shit.

703
00:33:49.285 --> 00:33:52.287
All right. He punched me
right in the face, man.

704
00:33:52.288 --> 00:33:53.721
Don't worry.
I got your back.

705
00:33:53.722 --> 00:33:55.023
You don't have anybody's back.

706
00:33:55.024 --> 00:33:56.992
I'm sorry, man.
It's all our fault.

707
00:33:56.993 --> 00:33:59.327
I haven't fighted in a fight
since grade 7.

708
00:33:59.328 --> 00:34:02.797
I know.
Hey. Are we gonna fight or what?

709
00:34:02.798 --> 00:34:03.999
Yeah, we're gonna fight.

710
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.001
We're gonna fight, all right.
Okay?

711
00:34:06.002 --> 00:34:08.336
You want some, huh, more?

712
00:34:08.337 --> 00:34:11.906
'Cause I am open for business,
okay? Ooh, where'd I go?

713
00:34:11.907 --> 00:34:14.075
Ooh, where'd I go?

714
00:34:14.076 --> 00:34:16.478
Yeah, how do you fight
what you can't see?

715
00:34:17.446 --> 00:34:20.982
Did you see
The Legend of Billy Jack?

716
00:34:20.983 --> 00:34:23.684
Because I'm gonna
take this foot,

717
00:34:23.685 --> 00:34:27.655
and I'm gonna whop you
on that side of your face,

718
00:34:27.656 --> 00:34:30.559
and there's not a goddamn thing
you can do about it.

719
00:34:32.161 --> 00:34:34.595
Just don't break my teeth
off on the curb, okay?

720
00:34:34.596 --> 00:34:38.866
But let's really sell this.
Give them a show.

721
00:34:38.867 --> 00:34:40.468
What?

722
00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:44.872
First, we have to establish
the ground rules,

723
00:34:44.873 --> 00:34:48.643
and the ground rules are
there are no ground rules.

724
00:34:52.148 --> 00:34:53.748
Idiot.

725
00:34:53.749 --> 00:34:55.650
I'm the wrong guy.

726
00:34:55.651 --> 00:34:58.786
Well, maybe you need to start
being the right guy.

727
00:34:58.787 --> 00:35:00.355
That's why you got punched out,

728
00:35:00.356 --> 00:35:04.159
because you got the wrong
attitude right out of the gate.

729
00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.793
I'm over here, dickhole.

730
00:35:05.794 --> 00:35:09.964
Oh, my God. That's so funny.

731
00:35:09.965 --> 00:35:11.532
You're a complete...

732
00:35:13.335 --> 00:35:15.703
You all right?
I almost blocked it.

733
00:35:15.704 --> 00:35:16.737
Didn't get there in time.

734
00:35:16.738 --> 00:35:18.606
Okay, we're done here.
We've been drinking.

735
00:35:18.607 --> 00:35:20.941
He's really been drinking.
Seriously, man.

736
00:35:20.942 --> 00:35:22.710
I'm glad we had this experience.

737
00:35:22.711 --> 00:35:26.781
I think we both grew from it.
Call me.

738
00:35:26.782 --> 00:35:28.550
You asshole.

739
00:35:31.153 --> 00:35:34.223
We really did.
Yeah. We did, bud.

740
00:35:36.792 --> 00:35:38.193
Oh.

741
00:35:38.194 --> 00:35:40.861
She's never gonna go to a ball.

742
00:35:40.862 --> 00:35:44.066
No. No, she's not.

743
00:36:15.397 --> 00:36:18.065
Okay. Tillie, there you are.

744
00:36:18.066 --> 00:36:19.467
Hi, Carl.

745
00:36:19.468 --> 00:36:21.269
What can I, uh, do for you?

746
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:23.138
Well, I was wondering
if you could help me

747
00:36:23.139 --> 00:36:24.740
put up some shelves.

748
00:36:25.474 --> 00:36:26.475
Oh, really?

749
00:36:33.549 --> 00:36:34.516
Okay.

750
00:36:34.517 --> 00:36:39.520
That should just about do it.

751
00:36:39.521 --> 00:36:40.888
I'll see you later, Tillie.

752
00:36:40.889 --> 00:36:43.191
That was wonderful, Carl.

753
00:36:43.192 --> 00:36:46.994
Oh, not so fast.

754
00:36:46.995 --> 00:36:48.796
Oh. What are you doing?

755
00:36:48.797 --> 00:36:52.800
Oh, darn, I forgot
to go to the bank.

756
00:36:52.801 --> 00:36:53.901
Oh, that's okay.

757
00:36:53.902 --> 00:36:56.504
I'm getting so forgetful.

758
00:36:56.505 --> 00:37:00.308
It happens with age.
Don't worry about it.

759
00:37:00.309 --> 00:37:03.211
I am gonna have
to repay you somehow.

760
00:37:03.212 --> 00:37:05.012
Oh, just doing
a favor for a neighbor

761
00:37:05.013 --> 00:37:07.183
is good enough for me.

762
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:11.552
You are so handsome.

763
00:37:11.553 --> 00:37:16.090
How come I never see you
with a girl over there? Hm?

764
00:37:16.091 --> 00:37:17.492
Well, I'm just...

765
00:37:17.493 --> 00:37:21.229
I'm not in a serious thing,
but I am dating.

766
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:24.199
Would you like a release?
I'm sorry?

767
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.101
You know, a sexual release?

768
00:37:27.102 --> 00:37:29.204
Uh...

769
00:37:29.205 --> 00:37:30.471
What do I do here?

770
00:37:30.472 --> 00:37:33.708
Oh, you don't have
to do anything, Carl.

771
00:37:33.709 --> 00:37:36.777
You just lay back and I will
take care of everything.

772
00:37:36.778 --> 00:37:40.981
I don't know what to say here.
I'm stumped. I'm baffled.

773
00:37:40.982 --> 00:37:43.418
I don't know if I'm gonna
be able to say yes

774
00:37:43.419 --> 00:37:44.619
to this one, Till.

775
00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:45.686
Oh, come on.

776
00:37:45.687 --> 00:37:47.855
But thanks for the offer,
and the image,

777
00:37:47.856 --> 00:37:50.358
and I've got this
thing I gotta do,

778
00:37:50.359 --> 00:37:52.228
so I'll be seeing you.

779
00:37:54.296 --> 00:37:56.865
In my nightmares.

780
00:37:58.567 --> 00:38:00.868
Oh, come on, give me a break.

781
00:38:00.869 --> 00:38:05.072
Terrence said this would happen
if I said no. That's ridiculous.

782
00:38:05.073 --> 00:38:10.144
Get out of there.
If I wanna say no, I'll say no!

783
00:38:23.959 --> 00:38:25.394
Nice dog.

784
00:38:36.705 --> 00:38:40.341
Just relax.
I'll handle this.

785
00:38:46.982 --> 00:38:48.683
Oh, God!

786
00:38:49.519 --> 00:38:53.821
Oh, God! Oh, no. Oh, my...

787
00:38:53.822 --> 00:38:55.623
Wow.

788
00:38:55.624 --> 00:38:57.426
That...

789
00:38:59.227 --> 00:39:00.595
That is a...

790
00:39:00.596 --> 00:39:01.796
How are you doing that?

791
00:39:09.137 --> 00:39:10.705
"Costume party.

792
00:39:10.706 --> 00:39:13.107
Come as your favorite
Harry Potter character."

793
00:39:13.108 --> 00:39:14.174
You got it, Norm.

794
00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:22.551
Ha.

795
00:40:02.157 --> 00:40:03.425
Hi.

796
00:40:05.026 --> 00:40:08.863
Really? I've always wanted
to try it. Yeah.

797
00:40:08.864 --> 00:40:11.298
So I can expect delivery anytime
between 8 a.m. and 5:30?

798
00:40:12.601 --> 00:40:15.069
Hello. We're wondering
if you had a moment

799
00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:16.804
to discuss
the Church of Jesus Christ.

800
00:40:16.805 --> 00:40:18.440
Yeah, come on in.

801
00:40:19.375 --> 00:40:20.841
Buttercup Girls.
Buttercup Girls.

802
00:40:20.842 --> 00:40:22.377
Buttercup Girls.

803
00:40:24.245 --> 00:40:26.348
Yeah. All right.

804
00:40:29.084 --> 00:40:31.318
Hey, it's really working.

805
00:40:37.258 --> 00:40:40.661
It's beautiful, man.
It's beautiful.

806
00:40:40.662 --> 00:40:44.532
I do wanna take guitar lessons.
I do wanna learn how to fly.

807
00:40:44.533 --> 00:40:46.333
Yes, I would like
to learn Korean.

808
00:40:46.334 --> 00:40:48.736
* I would under... *

809
00:40:48.737 --> 00:40:53.108
*... sta-a-a-a-n... *

810
00:40:53.942 --> 00:40:55.543
*... and *

811
00:40:55.544 --> 00:40:57.211
All right, now I got it.

812
00:41:00.449 --> 00:41:03.552
Whoa. Ha-ha-ha.

813
00:41:15.664 --> 00:41:17.164
What did he call me?

814
00:41:22.404 --> 00:41:24.372
Homeless. Hm.

815
00:41:26.041 --> 00:41:27.842
Come and get it.

816
00:41:27.843 --> 00:41:30.177
There you are. You want some?

817
00:41:30.178 --> 00:41:31.178
He never listens.

818
00:41:32.714 --> 00:41:33.781
Yeah.

819
00:41:33.782 --> 00:41:36.517
I wanna start
an organic-fertilizer

820
00:41:36.518 --> 00:41:38.053
distribution business.

821
00:41:42.023 --> 00:41:43.024
Next.

822
00:41:43.992 --> 00:41:45.460
Wanna see a... Oh, sorry.

823
00:41:45.461 --> 00:41:47.828
You know what? I'd love to.

824
00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:49.965
Way to stick in there.
Ha-ha.

825
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:10.485
There you go.

826
00:42:10.486 --> 00:42:13.053
Hey. I came.

827
00:42:13.054 --> 00:42:14.956
Great.

828
00:42:16.191 --> 00:42:17.759
Yeah.

829
00:42:19.094 --> 00:42:21.361
Uh, Rolling Rock, please.

830
00:42:23.565 --> 00:42:25.399
From the dawn of time...

831
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.967
In the netherworld.

832
00:42:26.968 --> 00:42:30.605
There was a band.

833
00:42:30.606 --> 00:42:32.707
Oh, yes, there was.

834
00:42:32.708 --> 00:42:35.009
And we were that band.

835
00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:36.811
Yes, we were.

836
00:42:36.812 --> 00:42:38.946
And that band made
rock 'n' roll.

837
00:42:38.947 --> 00:42:40.247
Oh, yes, they did.

838
00:42:40.248 --> 00:42:44.218
And that band ate arame
and other sea vegetables.

839
00:42:44.219 --> 00:42:47.421
Yeah.

840
00:42:47.422 --> 00:42:50.726
And that band was rad.

841
00:42:53.529 --> 00:42:55.462
Hello, Jake, Penelope,

842
00:42:55.463 --> 00:42:58.599
Rodrigo, Phillip, Zachary.

843
00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.134
We are Munchausen by Proxy.

844
00:43:00.135 --> 00:43:01.502
You're kidding me.

845
00:43:01.503 --> 00:43:03.938
* I should have been the one
To break up with you *

846
00:43:03.939 --> 00:43:06.240
* You said, "Who are you?" *

847
00:43:06.241 --> 00:43:07.942
* Who are you? *

848
00:43:07.943 --> 00:43:10.911
* I wanna snap your
neck And spit on you *

849
00:43:10.912 --> 00:43:13.681
* You said, "Who are you?" *

850
00:43:13.682 --> 00:43:15.650
* Who are you? *

851
00:43:15.651 --> 00:43:18.553
* If I got a call
That said you were dead *

852
00:43:18.554 --> 00:43:20.988
* You said, "Who are you?" *

853
00:43:20.989 --> 00:43:23.157
* Who are you? *

854
00:43:23.158 --> 00:43:25.726
* I'd shrug my shoulders
And I'd say "whatevs" *

855
00:43:25.727 --> 00:43:28.095
* You said, "Who are you?" *

856
00:43:28.096 --> 00:43:30.831
* Who are you? *

857
00:43:30.832 --> 00:43:33.668
Hey, did you ever
meet my friend Ian?

858
00:43:33.669 --> 00:43:35.502
He's a computer hacker.

859
00:43:35.503 --> 00:43:39.039
He helped me erase
your MySpace page.

860
00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:43.678
And your band's MySpace page.
And your Facebook page.

861
00:43:43.679 --> 00:43:45.713
Happy networking, asshole.

862
00:44:01.196 --> 00:44:06.601
* Don't call me past 11 p.m.
It won't happen again *

863
00:44:06.602 --> 00:44:08.636
* Happened once
It happened twice *

864
00:44:08.637 --> 00:44:10.170
* It happened three times *

865
00:44:10.171 --> 00:44:12.272
* Maybe four times,
Maybe five times, maybe... *

866
00:44:12.273 --> 00:44:15.142
* Maybe it happened six times
It won't happen a seventh time *

867
00:44:15.143 --> 00:44:18.213
* No, no, no, no *

868
00:44:19.314 --> 00:44:20.815
* Oh, oh *

869
00:44:20.816 --> 00:44:25.553
* I'm not your late night
Booty call *

870
00:44:27.022 --> 00:44:29.456
* Whore no more *

871
00:44:29.457 --> 00:44:34.729
* Don't call me past 11 p.m.
It won't happen again *

872
00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:36.997
* You can call me at 10:59 *

873
00:44:36.998 --> 00:44:41.401
* But don't call me at 11
'Cause that's my rule now *

874
00:44:52.213 --> 00:44:54.816
Can I get a water?

875
00:44:59.354 --> 00:45:02.623
Hey. Out-of-gas make-out guy.

876
00:45:02.624 --> 00:45:05.192
Did we make out?
Oh, right, we did.

877
00:45:05.193 --> 00:45:06.260
Now I remember.

878
00:45:06.261 --> 00:45:07.762
What are you doing here?

879
00:45:07.763 --> 00:45:09.029
I know. Is this crazy or what?

880
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:11.031
It's so crazy.
Yeah.

881
00:45:11.032 --> 00:45:13.868
Are you stalking me?
No. I would never do that.

882
00:45:13.869 --> 00:45:15.770
By the way, your new
living-room furniture

883
00:45:15.771 --> 00:45:18.105
looks great from the yard.
Ha-ha-ha.

884
00:45:18.106 --> 00:45:21.876
Hey, uh, great, um,
gig or whatever, you know.

885
00:45:21.877 --> 00:45:23.243
Thanks.
You know? Yeah.

886
00:45:23.244 --> 00:45:26.446
Strong lyrics.
You just make that stuff up?

887
00:45:26.447 --> 00:45:29.616
It comes from personal experience.
Cool.

888
00:45:29.617 --> 00:45:31.018
You want a drink?

889
00:45:31.019 --> 00:45:34.554
Oh, I can't.
I-I have to wake up early.

890
00:45:34.555 --> 00:45:37.958
Um, so I have to go, but...
Oh, really?

891
00:45:37.959 --> 00:45:39.593
Oh.

892
00:45:39.594 --> 00:45:43.031
But you can walk me
to my scooter.

893
00:45:43.899 --> 00:45:46.366
I teach a jogging photo group

894
00:45:46.367 --> 00:45:48.936
for people who want
to both exercise

895
00:45:48.937 --> 00:45:51.005
and practice photography.

896
00:45:51.006 --> 00:45:53.473
Oh, yeah, that's
getting very popular now.

897
00:45:53.474 --> 00:45:57.812
It's in Griffith Park and we do
a loop. It's about five miles.

898
00:45:57.813 --> 00:46:00.180
It's at 6 a.m.
Wow.

899
00:46:00.181 --> 00:46:04.719
I haven't been up at 6 a.m.
in, like, never.

900
00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.120
That's early.

901
00:46:06.121 --> 00:46:09.424
Yeah, but it makes
for amazing pictures.

902
00:46:10.325 --> 00:46:11.826
Okay, so you're in a band,

903
00:46:11.827 --> 00:46:14.962
you do the jogging photography,
what else?

904
00:46:14.963 --> 00:46:16.496
Oh, whatever I want.

905
00:46:16.497 --> 00:46:20.901
Um, I volunteer at a shelter.
I paint a little bit.

906
00:46:20.902 --> 00:46:23.603
Yeah, that's cool.
I've done some charity work.

907
00:46:23.604 --> 00:46:25.440
And some nude modeling, FYI.

908
00:46:27.042 --> 00:46:30.779
Good to know, if, you know,
if I ever need to...

909
00:46:32.047 --> 00:46:35.983
So anyway, my answer is yes.
I'd be happy to go out with you.

910
00:46:35.984 --> 00:46:38.185
I didn't ask you out.

911
00:46:38.186 --> 00:46:40.687
Could have fooled me with
that nude modeling comment.

912
00:46:40.688 --> 00:46:42.322
You said that.

913
00:46:42.323 --> 00:46:43.124
Well, whoever said it,

914
00:46:43.125 --> 00:46:45.160
it made me very uncomfortable.

915
00:46:47.228 --> 00:46:49.897
Hey, why don't you
come to my class tomorrow?

916
00:46:49.898 --> 00:46:51.665
Why don't you
stop smothering me?

917
00:46:51.666 --> 00:46:54.368
Seriously.
It's way too much too soon.

918
00:46:54.369 --> 00:46:55.771
Yeah, I'd love to.

919
00:46:57.005 --> 00:47:01.175
Okay. I'll see you
tomorrow, um...

920
00:47:01.176 --> 00:47:02.709
Carl.

921
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:04.511
Allison.

922
00:47:20.962 --> 00:47:22.462
Yeah, Rooney?

923
00:47:22.463 --> 00:47:24.464
Yo, Carl, hitting the clubs.

924
00:47:24.465 --> 00:47:25.866
Got a case of Red Bull.

925
00:47:25.867 --> 00:47:28.202
Gonna pull an all-nighter.
You down?

926
00:47:28.203 --> 00:47:29.237
Yeah.

927
00:47:37.112 --> 00:47:39.814
Okay, guys, everybody ready?
Cameras loaded?

928
00:47:39.815 --> 00:47:41.148
Allison?
Yeah?

929
00:47:41.149 --> 00:47:42.983
Do we need to use a flash?

930
00:47:42.984 --> 00:47:45.119
Not when the sun's up, Reggie.

931
00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.393
Whoo!

932
00:47:53.394 --> 00:47:54.995
Beautiful night, guys.

933
00:47:54.996 --> 00:47:56.931
You take it to the limit,
and I respect that.

934
00:47:56.932 --> 00:47:59.867
Hit me on the cell this week.
Let's do it again.

935
00:47:59.868 --> 00:48:01.936
Carl, if somebody asked me
to describe tonight,

936
00:48:01.937 --> 00:48:02.937
I would just go:

937
00:48:04.405 --> 00:48:06.440
Back at you, Roon.
Lee, I hardly know you,

938
00:48:06.441 --> 00:48:07.408
but I feel comfortable.

939
00:48:07.409 --> 00:48:09.376
Look how close
I'm getting. Ha-ha.

940
00:48:09.377 --> 00:48:11.478
Hey, Allison, it's me, Carl.
I'm here.

941
00:48:11.479 --> 00:48:12.779
Allison,

942
00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:13.982
I'm here.

943
00:48:15.817 --> 00:48:17.185
Allison.

944
00:48:18.453 --> 00:48:19.519
Hey.

945
00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.288
Wh-who were those guys?

946
00:48:21.289 --> 00:48:22.957
That's Rooney
and my new friend Lee.

947
00:48:22.958 --> 00:48:24.992
He's a male nurse.
I was making fun of him.

948
00:48:24.993 --> 00:48:26.493
We hit a couple raves
last night.

949
00:48:26.494 --> 00:48:27.928
It was totally off the hook.

950
00:48:27.929 --> 00:48:28.963
You seem a little hyper.

951
00:48:28.964 --> 00:48:30.297
Had a couple Red Bulls.

952
00:48:30.298 --> 00:48:32.032
Ever had Red Bull?
I never had Red Bull.

953
00:48:32.033 --> 00:48:34.234
Had Red Bull last night.
I like Red Bull.

954
00:48:34.235 --> 00:48:36.670
I got a new necklace.
Glows in the dark.

955
00:48:36.671 --> 00:48:38.738
Can't really see it right now,
unless you do this.

956
00:48:38.739 --> 00:48:40.140
That's really something.

957
00:48:40.141 --> 00:48:42.376
Doesn't Red Bull make
you crash pretty hard?

958
00:48:42.377 --> 00:48:45.379
No, no, no. No, no.
I don't think so. No.

959
00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:48.415
Uh, no. Hey, after we jog,
we should get a Red Bull.

960
00:48:48.416 --> 00:48:51.085
You and I could get a Red Bull.
We could share.

961
00:48:51.086 --> 00:48:52.887
Okay, that'd be fu...
Red Bull.

962
00:48:52.888 --> 00:48:54.154
That sounds...
Red Bull.

963
00:48:54.155 --> 00:48:55.655
I think I'd... Red
Bull.

964
00:48:55.656 --> 00:48:58.125
I'd really...
Red Bull.

965
00:48:58.126 --> 00:49:00.260
Re-e-ed Bull.

966
00:49:00.261 --> 00:49:03.830
Okay. A lot of energy.
I like it.

967
00:49:03.831 --> 00:49:05.432
Everybody, this is Carl.

968
00:49:05.433 --> 00:49:08.102
Carl, this is everybody.
Hey, everybody.

969
00:49:08.103 --> 00:49:11.505
Come on.
Let's get into shipshape.

970
00:49:17.478 --> 00:49:19.513
* North to south *

971
00:49:19.514 --> 00:49:21.048
Oh, it's a good one.

972
00:49:21.049 --> 00:49:22.550
* Empty *

973
00:49:23.318 --> 00:49:24.784
Hold that.
* Running on *

974
00:49:24.785 --> 00:49:26.320
Got it.

975
00:49:26.321 --> 00:49:27.587
* Bravado *

976
00:49:27.588 --> 00:49:29.756
* As if to say As if to say *

977
00:49:29.757 --> 00:49:33.327
* As if to say
He doesn't like chocolate *

978
00:49:33.328 --> 00:49:35.762
* He's born a liar
He'll die a liar *

979
00:49:35.763 --> 00:49:36.763
* Some things... *

980
00:49:36.764 --> 00:49:39.034
Hey, Carl, you okay?

981
00:49:40.635 --> 00:49:41.635
* Stop being *

982
00:49:41.636 --> 00:49:43.003
Hold it right there.

983
00:49:45.506 --> 00:49:47.975
* So American There's a time *

984
00:49:47.976 --> 00:49:50.311
* And there's a place *

985
00:49:51.379 --> 00:49:52.647
* So James Dean... *

986
00:49:58.786 --> 00:50:01.455
Oh, that's good.

987
00:50:01.456 --> 00:50:06.961
I can't put my finger on you.
You're kind of unpredictable.

988
00:50:06.962 --> 00:50:08.828
Kind of mysterious.

989
00:50:08.829 --> 00:50:10.197
You know, listen.

990
00:50:10.198 --> 00:50:12.566
I like to keep it fresh.
I like to live it up.

991
00:50:12.567 --> 00:50:13.900
I like to mix it up.

992
00:50:13.901 --> 00:50:16.270
If that doesn't jive with you,
we should end this right now.

993
00:50:16.271 --> 00:50:18.305
I love that.
Mm-hm.

994
00:50:18.306 --> 00:50:20.040
I don't know how people
go through life

995
00:50:20.041 --> 00:50:21.608
with the same boring
routine every day.

996
00:50:21.609 --> 00:50:23.978
I mean, just shoot me.
I know. Right in the face.

997
00:50:23.979 --> 00:50:25.345
Seriously, I dated this guy

998
00:50:25.346 --> 00:50:27.481
and I was astounded at how
perfectly content he was

999
00:50:27.482 --> 00:50:30.350
just living his life
in this closed-off little box.

1000
00:50:30.351 --> 00:50:31.785
I know. It's so frustrating.

1001
00:50:31.786 --> 00:50:34.221
I just wanna grab these people
and shake them.

1002
00:50:34.222 --> 00:50:35.722
Say, "Wake up, you."

1003
00:50:35.723 --> 00:50:38.125
You're missing out
on a little thing called life."

1004
00:50:38.126 --> 00:50:39.859
That's so true.
Yeah.

1005
00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:43.998
So, what happened
to closed-off-little-box boy?

1006
00:50:43.999 --> 00:50:47.367
It just didn't work out.
It's a long story.

1007
00:50:47.368 --> 00:50:51.005
Yeah? Same story you were
singing about last night?

1008
00:50:51.006 --> 00:50:53.373
Might be.

1009
00:50:53.374 --> 00:50:57.277
Closed-off-little-box boy,
tender topic. Probe no further.

1010
00:50:57.278 --> 00:51:00.614
Okay, if you must know,
we lived together.

1011
00:51:00.615 --> 00:51:03.750
I thought he was it,
the one, or whatever,

1012
00:51:03.751 --> 00:51:07.787
and then surprise, he ended it,
out of nowhere for no reason.

1013
00:51:07.788 --> 00:51:09.423
Gone, never saw him again.

1014
00:51:09.424 --> 00:51:10.924
Wow.

1015
00:51:10.925 --> 00:51:14.128
That's rough. I'm sorry.

1016
00:51:14.129 --> 00:51:15.529
Next time you really
should warn me

1017
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:17.197
about the length
of the story, though.

1018
00:51:17.198 --> 00:51:18.532
Kinda dragged on there.

1019
00:51:18.533 --> 00:51:21.135
I'll work on that. Okay.
Yeah, just trim the fat.

1020
00:51:21.136 --> 00:51:23.537
Oh! Jeez.

1021
00:51:23.538 --> 00:51:25.205
That was very healthy.

1022
00:51:36.951 --> 00:51:39.453
She's spontaneous.
She's ballsy.

1023
00:51:39.454 --> 00:51:42.189
She has no clue what she's doing
and she doesn't care.

1024
00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:43.623
She's the complete
opposite of me.

1025
00:51:43.624 --> 00:51:46.293
Carl, could you
please pass the Cholula?

1026
00:51:46.294 --> 00:51:47.595
Sure, Faranoush.

1027
00:51:49.197 --> 00:51:50.897
How did you two meet again?

1028
00:51:50.898 --> 00:51:52.499
Persianwifefinder.com.

1029
00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:54.768
It's pretty cool.
You should check it out.

1030
00:51:54.769 --> 00:51:57.003
I'm engaged.
Oh, yeah.

1031
00:51:57.004 --> 00:51:59.973
Should you be talking about
Allison in front of Faranoush?

1032
00:51:59.974 --> 00:52:02.709
It's okay, man. We just met.
She knows it's not exclusive.

1033
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:05.612
Besides, she's totally
not my type.

1034
00:52:05.613 --> 00:52:06.913
I can hear you.

1035
00:52:06.914 --> 00:52:08.348
Oh. Sorry, Faranoush.

1036
00:52:08.349 --> 00:52:10.217
Anyway, I never would
have met Allison

1037
00:52:10.218 --> 00:52:11.918
if I hadn't said yes
to the homeless guy.

1038
00:52:11.919 --> 00:52:15.289
You also wouldn't be on a date
with a strange Iranian woman.

1039
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:17.624
No offense, Faranoush.
None taken. Ha-ha-ha.

1040
00:52:17.625 --> 00:52:21.761
Wow. I didn't realize
I was dealing with a no man.

1041
00:52:21.762 --> 00:52:23.029
No, I think it's great.

1042
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:24.765
Throw this away for me,
will you?

1043
00:52:27.702 --> 00:52:29.104
Hey, honey.
Hey.

1044
00:52:31.439 --> 00:52:35.142
Lucy. Faranoush, Lucy.
Lucy, Faranoush.

1045
00:52:35.143 --> 00:52:36.344
Hello.

1046
00:52:37.412 --> 00:52:39.913
So my friends
are being really lame,

1047
00:52:39.914 --> 00:52:42.583
and nobody's offered
to throw me a bridal shower.

1048
00:52:43.584 --> 00:52:45.919
Hey, I have an idea.

1049
00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:49.556
Carl, would you like
to throw Lucy a bridal shower?

1050
00:52:49.557 --> 00:52:52.392
Yeah. Sure.

1051
00:52:52.393 --> 00:52:54.928
Why not? That'd be great.
Yeah, I'd... I'd love that.

1052
00:52:54.929 --> 00:52:56.731
Problem solved.
Yeah.

1053
00:52:59.066 --> 00:53:00.734
Um...

1054
00:53:02.237 --> 00:53:04.438
Really?
Yeah.

1055
00:53:04.439 --> 00:53:07.807
Well, thanks, Carl. Heh.

1056
00:53:07.808 --> 00:53:12.179
Thanks, that's really... sweet.

1057
00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:14.614
That's great.
That is sweet, Carl.

1058
00:53:14.615 --> 00:53:16.616
Thanks, Faranoush.

1059
00:53:16.617 --> 00:53:19.753
Oh, I forgot, I gotta pick up
costumes for me and Allison.

1060
00:53:19.754 --> 00:53:21.289
Costumes for what?

1061
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:24.791
Expelliarmus.
Ha-ha. Just kidding.

1062
00:53:24.792 --> 00:53:25.693
That's okay.

1063
00:53:25.694 --> 00:53:27.294
I blocked it and
deflected it back.

1064
00:53:27.295 --> 00:53:29.363
Oh. Ka-ching. Ha-ha.

1065
00:53:29.364 --> 00:53:31.398
Wow. Cool costume, my man.

1066
00:53:31.399 --> 00:53:33.967
The only one they had left
was for toddlers.

1067
00:53:33.968 --> 00:53:37.537
This is Allison and her
wand made from a sequoia.

1068
00:53:37.538 --> 00:53:39.739
Whoo. Hi.
You must be Norman.

1069
00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:43.110
Yes, nice to meet you.
Thanks for coming. Come in.

1070
00:53:45.413 --> 00:53:48.215
Yeah, we've got, well,
drinks, you know,

1071
00:53:48.216 --> 00:53:51.385
chips, dips, and good people,

1072
00:53:51.386 --> 00:53:53.653
just like you two.

1073
00:53:53.654 --> 00:53:54.854
Aw, thanks.

1074
00:53:54.855 --> 00:53:57.658
Pace yourselves.
It's gonna be a crazy night.

1075
00:54:02.797 --> 00:54:06.032
Get in there, play the zone.
Come on.

1076
00:54:06.033 --> 00:54:07.701
Good dip, huh, H.P.?

1077
00:54:07.702 --> 00:54:10.103
Mm.
Got tons of it at Costco.

1078
00:54:10.104 --> 00:54:12.872
You see, I've got
an exclusive membership card.

1079
00:54:12.873 --> 00:54:15.975
And with that card,
I get access to the whole place.

1080
00:54:15.976 --> 00:54:18.846
I can buy large quantities
of anything at discount prices.

1081
00:54:20.147 --> 00:54:22.449
Can't anyone get
one of those cards?

1082
00:54:22.450 --> 00:54:24.618
No, don't think so.

1083
00:54:24.619 --> 00:54:26.520
But I can, uh, talk to someone,
if you'd like.

1084
00:54:26.521 --> 00:54:30.056
Yeah, put in a good word for us.
That would be great.

1085
00:54:31.559 --> 00:54:34.528
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

1086
00:54:34.529 --> 00:54:38.665
"I'm not going home,
not really."

1087
00:54:41.168 --> 00:54:43.204
Oh, bye.

1088
00:54:47.408 --> 00:54:48.642
Alrighty, gang.

1089
00:54:48.643 --> 00:54:50.610
Who wants to watch
Chamber of Secrets?

1090
00:54:59.487 --> 00:55:02.689
Well, thanks for coming, guys.
So nice to meet you.

1091
00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:05.459
Oh, good to meet you too.
Thank you. And hey.

1092
00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:06.760
Oh.
That's right.

1093
00:55:06.761 --> 00:55:08.762
Come in. I'll go in.

1094
00:55:08.763 --> 00:55:11.265
Then you just keep your hand
there like in a shake.

1095
00:55:11.266 --> 00:55:12.932
The other hand
goes around for a hug.

1096
00:55:12.933 --> 00:55:14.234
Yeah. Tap it.

1097
00:55:14.235 --> 00:55:16.336
Thanks for walking me
through that.

1098
00:55:16.337 --> 00:55:18.305
That's all right.
Bye.

1099
00:55:18.306 --> 00:55:21.541
Okay, guys,
all aboard the Hogwarts Express.

1100
00:55:21.542 --> 00:55:24.143
Next stop, Azkaban.

1101
00:55:32.152 --> 00:55:33.887
Hey.

1102
00:55:33.888 --> 00:55:36.223
Do you wanna drive?

1103
00:55:40.227 --> 00:55:42.028
Woo. Heh-heh.

1104
00:55:42.029 --> 00:55:45.865
Hey, you're getting better.
Yeah, not bad, huh?

1105
00:55:45.866 --> 00:55:46.933
Whoa.

1106
00:55:46.934 --> 00:55:49.470
Yep, I got it. Heh-heh.

1107
00:55:55.075 --> 00:55:57.977
I got an idea.

1108
00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:07.455
We can't do this.
Why? You scared?

1109
00:56:10.358 --> 00:56:11.991
Hurry. Somebody's coming.

1110
00:56:11.992 --> 00:56:13.960
And I think I see something.
Hurry.

1111
00:56:17.598 --> 00:56:22.703
This is crazy.
I know, but it's great.

1112
00:56:48.496 --> 00:56:51.365
This is unreal.

1113
00:56:51.366 --> 00:56:53.668
I couldn't agree more.

1114
00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:03.843
* Say you don't need
Those diamond rings *

1115
00:57:03.844 --> 00:57:05.111
* Ooh *

1116
00:57:05.112 --> 00:57:08.982
* And I'll be satisfied *
* Ooh *

1117
00:57:08.983 --> 00:57:12.486
* Tell me that you want
Those kind of things *

1118
00:57:12.487 --> 00:57:14.588
* That money just can't buy *

1119
00:57:14.589 --> 00:57:15.955
* Ooh *

1120
00:57:15.956 --> 00:57:19.659
* I don't care too
Much for money *

1121
00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:23.363
* Money can't buy me love *

1122
00:57:31.138 --> 00:57:35.341
You know, I've never let anyone
drive my scooter before.

1123
00:57:35.342 --> 00:57:36.810
I've never let anyone kiss me

1124
00:57:36.811 --> 00:57:39.780
on the stage
of the Hollywood Bowl before.

1125
00:58:03.838 --> 00:58:06.005
Good evening, Los Angeles.

1126
00:58:06.006 --> 00:58:07.974
Please welcome
to the Hollywood Bowl

1127
00:58:07.975 --> 00:58:09.409
Munchausen by Proxy.

1128
00:58:11.078 --> 00:58:13.747
I'm your biggest fan.
Pow! I killed her.

1129
00:58:13.748 --> 00:58:15.314
Ha-ha-ha. Hee-hee-hee.

1130
00:58:15.315 --> 00:58:17.451
I'm a somebody.

1131
00:58:17.452 --> 00:58:20.420
I don't know about that.

1132
00:58:20.421 --> 00:58:22.055
Come on, you gotta
have creepy fans.

1133
00:58:22.056 --> 00:58:23.222
I don't think so.

1134
00:58:23.223 --> 00:58:25.258
We don't really have
that much of a following.

1135
00:58:25.259 --> 00:58:26.693
What are you talking about?

1136
00:58:26.694 --> 00:58:29.429
Rodrigo and the guys at the bar.
They can't be trusted.

1137
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:31.097
Then there's me and my friends.

1138
00:58:31.098 --> 00:58:34.568
That makes eight or nine
very unstable people.

1139
00:58:34.569 --> 00:58:37.236
How many people
can this place even hold?

1140
00:58:37.237 --> 00:58:38.838
Like, 17,000.

1141
00:58:38.839 --> 00:58:43.777
So each one of us invites...
1800 of our closest friends.

1142
00:58:43.778 --> 00:58:44.811
No need.

1143
00:58:44.812 --> 00:58:46.946
I know our music
isn't that mainstream.

1144
00:58:46.947 --> 00:58:49.148
What?
I love doing it.

1145
00:58:49.149 --> 00:58:50.917
It's like my photography.

1146
00:58:50.918 --> 00:58:53.620
I know there isn't that much
demand for blurry photographs

1147
00:58:53.621 --> 00:58:55.455
taken while running, but...

1148
00:58:55.456 --> 00:58:57.691
I wasn't gonna say anything.

1149
00:58:57.692 --> 00:58:59.626
You know, who cares?

1150
00:58:59.627 --> 00:59:01.461
The world's a playground.

1151
00:59:01.462 --> 00:59:03.062
You know that when you're a kid,

1152
00:59:03.063 --> 00:59:06.099
but somewhere along the way,
everyone forgets it.

1153
00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:08.768
I love your music.

1154
00:59:08.769 --> 00:59:12.005
Anybody can take a photo
standing still.

1155
00:59:12.006 --> 00:59:13.907
Hey!

1156
00:59:13.908 --> 00:59:16.442
What are you doing?
Oh, shit.

1157
00:59:16.443 --> 00:59:18.311
Stop.
Stopping.

1158
00:59:18.312 --> 00:59:20.680
Come on, Carl, run.
Oh, thanks.

1159
00:59:20.681 --> 00:59:22.148
Wait right there.
You got it.

1160
00:59:22.149 --> 00:59:24.884
Down on the ground.
Whatever you say.

1161
00:59:24.885 --> 00:59:26.520
Carl, what are you doing?
Let's go.

1162
00:59:26.521 --> 00:59:28.989
All right.
I can't please everyone.

1163
00:59:31.792 --> 00:59:33.292
Run!

1164
00:59:33.293 --> 00:59:35.061
Hello, everybody.

1165
00:59:35.062 --> 00:59:38.732
A little vitamin C.
Keep your strength up.

1166
00:59:38.733 --> 00:59:40.767
I will be right with you.

1167
00:59:40.768 --> 00:59:42.569
Pass those out, will you?
Sure.

1168
00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:45.740
Un chapeau.
C'est magnifique.

1169
00:59:47.407 --> 00:59:48.542
Lee?

1170
00:59:48.543 --> 00:59:50.309
Hey.

1171
00:59:50.310 --> 00:59:52.613
What up, my brizzo?

1172
00:59:53.948 --> 00:59:57.351
That's not right, is it?
Carl, I need you for a second.

1173
00:59:58.118 --> 01:00:00.821
Can you hang on a minute, Lee?

1174
01:00:02.156 --> 01:00:04.157
What's going on, Norm?

1175
01:00:04.158 --> 01:00:06.159
Something's going down
on a big scale.

1176
01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.795
Guy from Corporate's here.
Don't look.

1177
01:00:08.796 --> 01:00:10.263
He wants to talk to you.

1178
01:00:10.264 --> 01:00:13.066
I think it's about all those
loans you've been approving.

1179
01:00:13.067 --> 01:00:14.300
Ooh.

1180
01:00:14.301 --> 01:00:17.270
Well, we had a nice run.

1181
01:00:17.271 --> 01:00:19.539
I might get shit-canned, Norm.

1182
01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:22.876
Anyway, don't worry about it.
It'll lead to something good.

1183
01:00:22.877 --> 01:00:25.111
Oh, hey, I'm part of this too.
No.

1184
01:00:25.112 --> 01:00:27.313
Yeah. I stood by
and let it happen.

1185
01:00:27.314 --> 01:00:28.848
Norm...
You were feeling it.

1186
01:00:28.849 --> 01:00:30.650
You were in the loan zone,
remember?

1187
01:00:30.651 --> 01:00:32.185
Yeah, I was.
I was watching you.

1188
01:00:32.186 --> 01:00:33.319
Yeah, you were.

1189
01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.021
But I'm afraid
it's caught up with us.

1190
01:00:35.022 --> 01:00:37.090
Right now you and I
have to face the music.

1191
01:00:37.091 --> 01:00:40.560
Come on.
Hey. Can I have one minute?

1192
01:00:40.561 --> 01:00:41.795
Okay.

1193
01:00:41.796 --> 01:00:43.663
Lee? What do you need?

1194
01:00:43.664 --> 01:00:45.833
You may be my last loan.

1195
01:00:46.734 --> 01:00:49.468
Oh.
It's a Ducati.

1196
01:00:49.469 --> 01:00:50.737
I'm thinking it'll get people

1197
01:00:50.738 --> 01:00:52.505
off my back about
the male nurse thing.

1198
01:00:54.074 --> 01:00:55.742
See what I mean?

1199
01:00:55.743 --> 01:00:58.078
Yeah. Nice ride.

1200
01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.650
See you on the other side, Lee.

1201
01:01:04.752 --> 01:01:05.953
Carl.

1202
01:01:09.323 --> 01:01:10.790
Wesley T. Parker.

1203
01:01:10.791 --> 01:01:12.626
Vice President,
Brea Federal Savings.

1204
01:01:12.627 --> 01:01:14.729
Pleasure to meet you.

1205
01:01:22.102 --> 01:01:24.237
Every two months,
the typical loan officer

1206
01:01:24.238 --> 01:01:26.539
approves 35 to 40 loans.

1207
01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:29.375
You have given out:

1208
01:01:29.376 --> 01:01:31.310
561.

1209
01:01:31.311 --> 01:01:33.680
So a little more
than average, then.

1210
01:01:33.681 --> 01:01:36.315
What's even more unusual
are the amounts.

1211
01:01:36.316 --> 01:01:40.053
A $250 loan for a mountain bike,

1212
01:01:40.054 --> 01:01:43.657
$600 for windsurfing lessons.

1213
01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:45.458
Have you ever tried that?
It's fun.

1214
01:01:45.459 --> 01:01:48.227
Carl, this bank traditionally
has never given out small loans.

1215
01:01:48.228 --> 01:01:51.097
If I can explain... Yeah, certainly.
Sit down.

1216
01:01:51.098 --> 01:01:53.833
At first I thought you
might be raiding our coffers.

1217
01:01:53.834 --> 01:01:55.301
I would never do that.

1218
01:01:55.302 --> 01:01:57.137
I would if I could,
why wouldn't you?

1219
01:02:02.476 --> 01:02:04.143
Ah. But...

1220
01:02:06.881 --> 01:02:08.948
But then I looked closer.

1221
01:02:08.949 --> 01:02:11.851
These people are so grateful
to have their needs met,

1222
01:02:11.852 --> 01:02:13.119
more than 98 percent of them

1223
01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.088
are following through
with the payments,

1224
01:02:15.089 --> 01:02:17.323
and because you've given
out so many of them,

1225
01:02:17.324 --> 01:02:19.125
we're actually making
a lot of money.

1226
01:02:19.126 --> 01:02:21.861
Carl, these micro-loans,
not bad.

1227
01:02:21.862 --> 01:02:24.230
See, Car, you worrywart.

1228
01:02:24.231 --> 01:02:26.632
Carl, what would you
say if I asked you

1229
01:02:26.633 --> 01:02:28.234
to work upstairs
with the big boys?

1230
01:02:28.235 --> 01:02:30.403
Corporate?
Wow.

1231
01:02:30.404 --> 01:02:32.839
That's great.
I would have to say...

1232
01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.842
No, wait. Before we,
uh, give our answer,

1233
01:02:35.843 --> 01:02:38.111
let's talk money.
Dollars and cents, Wes.

1234
01:02:38.112 --> 01:02:39.913
I'm afraid I can't
discuss that with you,

1235
01:02:39.914 --> 01:02:41.314
since we're only taking Carl.

1236
01:02:41.315 --> 01:02:43.382
Got it. Yep.

1237
01:02:43.383 --> 01:02:45.051
We'll have
the employment contract

1238
01:02:45.052 --> 01:02:47.153
to you by the end of the day.

1239
01:02:47.154 --> 01:02:49.055
Nice work, Carl. Bump my fist.

1240
01:02:49.056 --> 01:02:52.325
Aw, missed it.
I was gonna fist you.

1241
01:02:52.326 --> 01:02:54.494
Here's some fist.

1242
01:02:59.734 --> 01:03:01.334
Oh.

1243
01:03:01.335 --> 01:03:03.136
Oh, this one is nice.

1244
01:03:03.137 --> 01:03:05.772
I especially love it in cream.
What...? What do you think?

1245
01:03:05.773 --> 01:03:07.140
I love it.
Yeah?

1246
01:03:07.141 --> 01:03:08.374
Yeah.

1247
01:03:08.375 --> 01:03:12.145
Bridal bingo?
How do you play bridal bingo?

1248
01:03:12.146 --> 01:03:14.080
It's the same as regular bingo,

1249
01:03:14.081 --> 01:03:18.085
but you just yell embarrassing
facts about the bride, okay?

1250
01:03:19.053 --> 01:03:20.053
Yeah.

1251
01:03:20.054 --> 01:03:21.888
No, I'm not doing bridal bingo.
Come on.

1252
01:03:21.889 --> 01:03:23.422
No, I don't want
anything complicated.

1253
01:03:23.423 --> 01:03:25.124
You gotta squeeze
every drop of juice

1254
01:03:25.125 --> 01:03:26.525
out of this experience.

1255
01:03:26.526 --> 01:03:28.527
It doesn't sound complicated.
Is it complicated?

1256
01:03:28.528 --> 01:03:31.664
Are you going to be asking
a lot more question?

1257
01:03:31.665 --> 01:03:33.366
I don't got all day.

1258
01:03:36.236 --> 01:03:38.004
Maybe we should just
go somewhere else.

1259
01:03:38.005 --> 01:03:40.774
That's okay.
I'll talk to her.

1260
01:04:00.194 --> 01:04:01.996
Mm.

1261
01:04:29.423 --> 01:04:30.390
Okay.

1262
01:04:32.592 --> 01:04:34.060
Okay.

1263
01:04:34.061 --> 01:04:36.562
Okay, bridal bingo very simple,
okay?

1264
01:04:36.563 --> 01:04:40.433
I can... I can explain to you
in more detail if you want.

1265
01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:49.342
What's going on?

1266
01:04:49.343 --> 01:04:52.178
I mean, someone's trying
to kill himself.

1267
01:04:52.179 --> 01:04:53.279
Ooh.

1268
01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.881
Jump.

1269
01:04:54.882 --> 01:04:58.651
What the hell
are you looking at? Huh?

1270
01:04:58.652 --> 01:05:02.621
Don't point at me, buddy.
Don't do it.

1271
01:05:02.622 --> 01:05:04.490
Hey, lady, move that dog.

1272
01:05:04.491 --> 01:05:07.827
Buddy, can you move over
a little bit, like two feet?

1273
01:05:07.828 --> 01:05:09.328
Has somebody called the police?

1274
01:05:09.329 --> 01:05:11.330
Yeah, but he'll be dead
before they get here.

1275
01:05:11.331 --> 01:05:13.032
Somebody needs to talk him down.

1276
01:05:13.033 --> 01:05:15.734
Move out the way.
Somebody help him.

1277
01:05:35.089 --> 01:05:36.856
Don't do it.

1278
01:05:38.792 --> 01:05:41.028
It can't be that bad.

1279
01:05:42.662 --> 01:05:44.697
Hey, buddy.
Whoa.

1280
01:05:44.698 --> 01:05:46.799
Who are you, man?

1281
01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:48.167
Don't...
Don't try anything.

1282
01:05:48.168 --> 01:05:50.536
I'm gonna kill myself,
so don't try to stop me.

1283
01:05:50.537 --> 01:05:53.572
Uh, okay. Um...
Wha...? What do mean, "Okay"?

1284
01:05:53.573 --> 01:05:57.877
No, I-I don't mean okay.
Just give me a second.

1285
01:05:57.878 --> 01:05:59.913
Uh, I should say
something to you here.

1286
01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:01.714
Um...

1287
01:06:01.715 --> 01:06:03.316
I don't really know what it is.

1288
01:06:03.317 --> 01:06:05.518
Man, you terrible at this.
Are you even a cop?

1289
01:06:05.519 --> 01:06:07.988
Hold on a second,
I'm thinking. Um...

1290
01:06:10.457 --> 01:06:13.560
Wait. I've got it.

1291
01:06:16.530 --> 01:06:18.164
Where you going, man?

1292
01:06:18.165 --> 01:06:19.966
I know it's not
what I think it is.

1293
01:06:19.967 --> 01:06:21.300
Just stop.

1294
01:06:21.301 --> 01:06:23.469
Oh, man.

1295
01:06:28.108 --> 01:06:30.543
My man. Hello?
Don't do it.

1296
01:06:30.544 --> 01:06:32.078
I'm... I'm coming.

1297
01:06:32.079 --> 01:06:34.880
Patience is a virtue.

1298
01:06:37.484 --> 01:06:39.953
What the hell
you doing in there?

1299
01:06:43.223 --> 01:06:47.460
* I wish you would step back
From that ledge, my friend *

1300
01:06:47.461 --> 01:06:50.696
* You could cut ties
With all the lies *

1301
01:06:50.697 --> 01:06:54.200
* That you've been living in *

1302
01:06:54.201 --> 01:06:56.936
* And if you never want *

1303
01:06:56.937 --> 01:06:58.137
* To see me again *

1304
01:06:58.138 --> 01:07:02.176
* I would understand *

1305
01:07:04.311 --> 01:07:10.716
* I would understa-a-a-and *

1306
01:07:10.717 --> 01:07:12.785
Um... Oh.

1307
01:07:12.786 --> 01:07:14.420
What is it?

1308
01:07:15.489 --> 01:07:17.856
* The angry boy
A bit too insane *

1309
01:07:17.857 --> 01:07:20.826
* Icing over a secret pain *

1310
01:07:20.827 --> 01:07:26.132
* You know you don't belong *

1311
01:07:26.133 --> 01:07:30.836
* Everyone I know
Has got a reason *

1312
01:07:30.837 --> 01:07:32.371
* To say *

1313
01:07:32.372 --> 01:07:33.973
* You can put the past away *

1314
01:07:33.974 --> 01:07:38.077
* I wish you would step back
From that ledge, my friend *

1315
01:07:38.078 --> 01:07:41.014
* You could cut
ties With all the lies *

1316
01:07:41.015 --> 01:07:43.816
* You've been living in *

1317
01:07:43.817 --> 01:07:47.086
* And if you never want
To see me again *

1318
01:07:47.087 --> 01:07:51.991
* I would understand *

1319
01:07:51.992 --> 01:08:01.567
* I would understand *

1320
01:08:01.568 --> 01:08:09.075
* I would understand *

1321
01:08:17.517 --> 01:08:20.454
I got blisters on my fingers.

1322
01:08:28.395 --> 01:08:30.196
Carl.

1323
01:08:30.197 --> 01:08:33.199
Stephanie, Ted, hey.

1324
01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.434
How's it going?
What are you guys doing here?

1325
01:08:35.435 --> 01:08:37.036
Oh, we're doing
a week in Tahiti.

1326
01:08:37.037 --> 01:08:39.372
Ted's father owns a little
piece of property down there.

1327
01:08:39.373 --> 01:08:41.707
A hundred acres
isn't so little, hon.

1328
01:08:41.708 --> 01:08:43.942
Not in Tahiti, anyway.

1329
01:08:43.943 --> 01:08:46.679
Hey, I saw you on TV.

1330
01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:48.781
That was amazing, Carl.

1331
01:08:48.782 --> 01:08:51.484
It's just a little life
that needed saving. No big deal.

1332
01:08:51.485 --> 01:08:54.687
So where you headed?
I'm meeting my girlfriend here.

1333
01:08:54.688 --> 01:08:56.755
We don't know where we're going.
Really?

1334
01:08:56.756 --> 01:08:58.624
Yeah, we're just gonna
pick a place.

1335
01:08:58.625 --> 01:09:00.759
Kind of an eenie,
meenie, minie thing.

1336
01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:01.894
Keeps it fresh.

1337
01:09:01.895 --> 01:09:03.429
I'll see you guys.

1338
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:04.431
Ha.

1339
01:09:05.532 --> 01:09:08.567
That sounds like a lot of fun.
Can you imagine?

1340
01:09:08.568 --> 01:09:09.569
No.

1341
01:09:21.815 --> 01:09:23.716
So I have some carryon here.

1342
01:09:23.717 --> 01:09:25.118
Uh, I'd like two tickets

1343
01:09:25.119 --> 01:09:28.187
on the first plane
out of here, please.

1344
01:09:28.188 --> 01:09:30.190
We've never done this before.

1345
01:09:32.459 --> 01:09:36.596
The next flight available
for boarding is to...

1346
01:09:37.697 --> 01:09:39.333
Lincoln, Nebraska.

1347
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.168
Okay.

1348
01:09:42.169 --> 01:09:43.336
Okay.
Okay.

1349
01:09:43.337 --> 01:09:44.803
Lincoln? Yeah?
Lincoln.

1350
01:09:44.804 --> 01:09:46.071
Lincoln. Here we come.

1351
01:09:49.676 --> 01:09:52.178
Where does someone go
in Lincoln, Nebraska?

1352
01:09:52.179 --> 01:09:54.581
Well, clearly
we should go there.

1353
01:10:00.854 --> 01:10:03.522
"The earliest
switchboard operators' headsets

1354
01:10:03.523 --> 01:10:05.691
weighed over
10 and a half pounds."

1355
01:10:05.692 --> 01:10:08.762
Hm. Interesting.
Look at this.

1356
01:10:10.164 --> 01:10:12.631
Very first phone call ever.
Pretty cool.

1357
01:10:12.632 --> 01:10:13.699
Check out the phone.

1358
01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:16.135
Smaller than I thought
they would be.

1359
01:10:16.136 --> 01:10:18.504
Oh, hold on, I'm vibrating.

1360
01:10:18.505 --> 01:10:19.572
Y-ello?

1361
01:10:24.711 --> 01:10:26.078
Nice shot.

1362
01:10:26.079 --> 01:10:28.181
Ha.

1363
01:10:28.182 --> 01:10:31.984
What do you know about that?
Pretty sexy.

1364
01:10:33.019 --> 01:10:34.253
So, what do I do? I just...

1365
01:10:34.254 --> 01:10:36.255
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1366
01:10:36.256 --> 01:10:38.258
Take it easy.
Here you go.

1367
01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:42.795
Okay, uh...
You got it.

1368
01:10:42.796 --> 01:10:44.164
Pull?

1369
01:10:45.532 --> 01:10:46.965
Good one.
I got it.

1370
01:10:46.966 --> 01:10:47.966
I got it.

1371
01:10:47.967 --> 01:10:49.368
Can I do it again?

1372
01:10:49.369 --> 01:10:50.936
Can I do it again?
What's wrong?

1373
01:10:56.075 --> 01:10:58.043
Ladies and
gentlemen, let's hear it

1374
01:10:58.044 --> 01:11:03.816
for your University
of Nebraska Cornhuskers.

1375
01:11:10.990 --> 01:11:13.792
Twenty bucks says
Oklahoma kills them.

1376
01:11:13.793 --> 01:11:16.195
Oh, oh, hey, Pete, you mind
putting that on a coaster?

1377
01:11:16.196 --> 01:11:17.696
What, do you live here now?

1378
01:11:17.697 --> 01:11:21.734
Yeah. I asked Carl
and he had to say yes.

1379
01:11:21.735 --> 01:11:24.403
Hey. Is that Carl?

1380
01:11:24.404 --> 01:11:26.840
Oh, wait a second.
Wait a second, wait a second.

1381
01:11:27.941 --> 01:11:30.209
The energy is
palpable here, Chris.

1382
01:11:30.210 --> 01:11:32.211
I can't even hear myself think.

1383
01:11:34.214 --> 01:11:37.483
I guess they're in Nebraska.
Wow.

1384
01:11:37.484 --> 01:11:39.985
Now, this is the really
interesting part,

1385
01:11:39.986 --> 01:11:42.255
Because if you don't
take the heads off properly,

1386
01:11:42.256 --> 01:11:44.257
then everything gets mixed
into the batch.

1387
01:11:44.258 --> 01:11:46.525
Someone gets a beak
in their bucket

1388
01:11:46.526 --> 01:11:47.926
or a mouthful of tendons,

1389
01:11:47.927 --> 01:11:51.297
and you got a lawsuit
on your hands.

1390
01:11:51.298 --> 01:11:54.668
We got a fainter
down in Head Removal.

1391
01:11:59.005 --> 01:12:02.908
I can't believe
I tripped like that.

1392
01:12:02.909 --> 01:12:04.643
It seemed like you fainted.

1393
01:12:04.644 --> 01:12:06.945
No, I told you,
my foot caught a nail.

1394
01:12:06.946 --> 01:12:10.983
Okay, because I thought it was
all the beaks in the bucket.

1395
01:12:10.984 --> 01:12:12.485
Don't, please.

1396
01:12:14.488 --> 01:12:16.655
Oh, God.
It's starting to rain.

1397
01:12:18.224 --> 01:12:20.926
Here. I have to protect you.

1398
01:12:20.927 --> 01:12:22.261
Come on.

1399
01:12:22.262 --> 01:12:26.699
Hurry, there's no time to lose.
We have to find shelter.

1400
01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:28.468
Come on.

1401
01:12:29.603 --> 01:12:33.439
Get in here.
It's okay. I got you.

1402
01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:36.742
Allison, are you okay?

1403
01:12:36.743 --> 01:12:39.845
Are you hurt? Are you hurt?
You're okay?

1404
01:12:46.786 --> 01:12:48.220
What?

1405
01:12:48.221 --> 01:12:51.925
I don't know.
I think I love you.

1406
01:12:53.092 --> 01:12:54.627
Really?

1407
01:12:54.628 --> 01:12:57.262
I've known that I like you
for a while,

1408
01:12:57.263 --> 01:12:59.432
but just now I decided
that I love you.

1409
01:12:59.433 --> 01:13:03.001
Do you love me?
Definitely.

1410
01:13:03.002 --> 01:13:05.203
I love you like...

1411
01:13:05.204 --> 01:13:06.639
I can't believe it.

1412
01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.574
It's kind of ridiculous.

1413
01:13:08.575 --> 01:13:10.809
I've been thinking,

1414
01:13:10.810 --> 01:13:13.312
and I know it's crazy,
especially for me,

1415
01:13:13.313 --> 01:13:18.751
but maybe when we get back
we should move in together.

1416
01:13:18.752 --> 01:13:20.486
Wow.

1417
01:13:20.487 --> 01:13:23.556
Really?
You've been thinking that?

1418
01:13:23.557 --> 01:13:25.391
What do you think?

1419
01:13:25.392 --> 01:13:26.725
What do I think?

1420
01:13:26.726 --> 01:13:29.895
Uh... yeah.
Oh, God. You paused.

1421
01:13:29.896 --> 01:13:31.597
No, I didn't pause.
You paused.

1422
01:13:31.598 --> 01:13:33.699
No, no, no, I didn't pause.
It was just a big step.

1423
01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:36.469
No, it was a stupid idea.
I shouldn't have said anything.

1424
01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:38.437
No, stop. Come on,
what are you talking about?

1425
01:13:38.438 --> 01:13:40.606
Here, ask me again.

1426
01:13:40.607 --> 01:13:43.342
Do you wanna move...?
Yes. Did I pause there?

1427
01:13:43.343 --> 01:13:46.445
I could probably knock a couple
milliseconds off that if you...

1428
01:14:01.961 --> 01:14:03.896
Where are you traveling today?

1429
01:14:03.897 --> 01:14:06.600
Los Angeles.

1430
01:14:08.568 --> 01:14:11.370
I'll just be one minute.

1431
01:14:11.371 --> 01:14:15.273
We should do this every weekend.
We could see the whole world.

1432
01:14:15.274 --> 01:14:17.342
I'm in.

1433
01:14:17.343 --> 01:14:20.480
You okay?
Yeah, I'm good.

1434
01:14:22.449 --> 01:14:24.751
Sir?

1435
01:14:25.719 --> 01:14:28.854
You mind coming with us, please?
I'm sorry?

1436
01:14:28.855 --> 01:14:31.891
We just wanna ask you
a few questions.

1437
01:14:33.793 --> 01:14:37.329
You're hilarious.
Oh, that's great.

1438
01:14:37.330 --> 01:14:39.231
Oh, beautiful.

1439
01:14:39.232 --> 01:14:40.699
Are you in on this too?

1440
01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:42.568
Oh, my God, you guys really
had me going there.

1441
01:14:42.569 --> 01:14:44.302
There's a crazy man
in the terminal.

1442
01:14:44.303 --> 01:14:45.771
Whoo! Red alert.

1443
01:14:46.906 --> 01:14:49.408
Oh, good job. Oh.
Let's go, funny guy.

1444
01:14:49.409 --> 01:14:51.545
Come on, lady.

1445
01:14:52.679 --> 01:14:55.213
Do you hate your country,
Mr. Allen?

1446
01:14:55.214 --> 01:14:56.214
What?

1447
01:14:56.215 --> 01:14:58.951
Do you hate America?

1448
01:14:58.952 --> 01:15:00.486
No. Of course not.

1449
01:15:00.487 --> 01:15:02.588
Then why are you plotting
to attack it?

1450
01:15:02.589 --> 01:15:04.723
What?
I think you have the wrong guy.

1451
01:15:04.724 --> 01:15:06.759
Oh, I'm sorry.
W-was I speaking to you?

1452
01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:08.360
We've been tracking you,
Mr. Allen.

1453
01:15:08.361 --> 01:15:10.763
We know who you are,
we know what you're planning.

1454
01:15:10.764 --> 01:15:13.198
This is insane.
Do you think I'm a terrorist?

1455
01:15:13.199 --> 01:15:15.801
Why did you purchase these
plane tickets last-minute?

1456
01:15:15.802 --> 01:15:18.003
It was a spontaneous vacation.

1457
01:15:18.004 --> 01:15:20.105
Oh, right. I was just
saying to Agent Tweed

1458
01:15:20.106 --> 01:15:22.107
how I wanted to take
a fun-filled vacation

1459
01:15:22.108 --> 01:15:23.442
to Lincoln, Nebraska.

1460
01:15:23.443 --> 01:15:27.913
Are you currently a member
of Persianwifefinder.com?

1461
01:15:27.914 --> 01:15:31.283
Yes, but you don't understand.
Yes? Who is that?

1462
01:15:31.284 --> 01:15:32.551
Faranoush.
It was nothing.

1463
01:15:32.552 --> 01:15:34.520
I can explain.
I can explain.

1464
01:15:34.521 --> 01:15:36.054
Explain this, jackhole.

1465
01:15:36.055 --> 01:15:37.122
As Chief Loan Officer

1466
01:15:37.123 --> 01:15:38.857
at Brea Federal
Savings and Loan,

1467
01:15:38.858 --> 01:15:41.226
you gave a man money
to start a fertilizer business.

1468
01:15:41.227 --> 01:15:42.528
For what, bombs?
No.

1469
01:15:42.529 --> 01:15:43.696
Have you recently

1470
01:15:43.697 --> 01:15:45.097
started taking flying lessons?

1471
01:15:45.098 --> 01:15:47.766
Yes. Oh, come on.
Why did you learn Korean?

1472
01:15:47.767 --> 01:15:49.502
Are you aligned
with the North Koreans?

1473
01:15:49.503 --> 01:15:51.403
No. What?
You were married for six months.

1474
01:15:51.404 --> 01:15:53.305
Some sort of immigration thing?

1475
01:15:53.306 --> 01:15:55.307
You were married?
Yes.

1476
01:15:55.308 --> 01:15:58.677
Oh. That was a long time ago.
I-I was gonna tell you.

1477
01:15:58.678 --> 01:16:00.445
I was gonna tell her.
I just never...

1478
01:16:01.515 --> 01:16:03.148
Start talking, Carl,

1479
01:16:03.149 --> 01:16:04.583
if that is your real name.

1480
01:16:04.584 --> 01:16:06.719
We knew another Karl

1481
01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:09.789
we weren't too crazy about,
didn't we, Tweed?

1482
01:16:11.024 --> 01:16:13.026
His name was Marx.

1483
01:16:16.496 --> 01:16:18.998
I need to speak to my attorney.

1484
01:16:23.436 --> 01:16:24.837
Several months ago,

1485
01:16:24.838 --> 01:16:26.471
my client attended
a self-empowerment seminar

1486
01:16:26.472 --> 01:16:30.843
that requires him to say yes
to any request that's presented.

1487
01:16:30.844 --> 01:16:33.912
So all of the activity
that appears suspicious,

1488
01:16:33.913 --> 01:16:37.115
the flying lessons,
the spontaneous trip-taking,

1489
01:16:37.116 --> 01:16:40.052
it's all because he must
say yes to any opportunity.

1490
01:16:40.053 --> 01:16:43.656
He's really into it.
You just say yes to everything?

1491
01:16:43.657 --> 01:16:45.390
Are you kidding me?
It's not how it sounds.

1492
01:16:45.391 --> 01:16:47.259
Oh? How does it sounds?
I'd love to hear this.

1493
01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:48.594
I'm wondering if there's

1494
01:16:48.595 --> 01:16:50.696
a better setting
for this back and forth.

1495
01:16:50.697 --> 01:16:53.900
Yeah, maybe we should speak
privately. Come on outside.

1496
01:16:57.136 --> 01:16:59.805
That was close.
What the hell, Carl?

1497
01:16:59.806 --> 01:17:01.907
Are you serious?
You say just yes to everything?

1498
01:17:01.908 --> 01:17:05.143
Even if you don't like it?
No, of course not.

1499
01:17:05.144 --> 01:17:06.845
Sometimes.

1500
01:17:06.846 --> 01:17:09.147
Oh, good. What a relief.
I thought you lied all the time,

1501
01:17:09.148 --> 01:17:11.516
but it's just sometimes.
That's really excellent.

1502
01:17:11.517 --> 01:17:13.251
So you didn't wanna
come to my show,

1503
01:17:13.252 --> 01:17:15.387
you didn't wanna
go jogging with me,

1504
01:17:15.388 --> 01:17:16.855
you didn't wanna travel with me?

1505
01:17:16.856 --> 01:17:18.757
Yes, I did.
That was my idea.

1506
01:17:18.758 --> 01:17:19.858
And when I asked you

1507
01:17:19.859 --> 01:17:21.359
if you wanted
to move in together,

1508
01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:23.696
that took a lot for me
to do that, and I meant it.

1509
01:17:23.697 --> 01:17:24.997
And I didn't know
what to expect,

1510
01:17:24.998 --> 01:17:27.132
but I guess I figured
like an adult,

1511
01:17:27.133 --> 01:17:29.134
you were gonna
weigh the options.

1512
01:17:29.135 --> 01:17:30.235
You paused.

1513
01:17:30.236 --> 01:17:32.004
You wanted to say no
but you couldn't,

1514
01:17:32.005 --> 01:17:33.305
because you had to say yes.

1515
01:17:33.306 --> 01:17:36.274
That's not entirely true.

1516
01:17:36.275 --> 01:17:38.744
How do I know if anything you
did was because you wanted to

1517
01:17:38.745 --> 01:17:40.846
or because you were
following a goddamn program?

1518
01:17:49.355 --> 01:17:50.355
Allison.

1519
01:17:52.358 --> 01:17:54.093
Bye, Carl.

1520
01:18:08.875 --> 01:18:10.876
I can't believe I didn't
tell her I was married.

1521
01:18:10.877 --> 01:18:12.077
I'm such an idiot.

1522
01:18:12.078 --> 01:18:13.646
You know what I did?
What's that?

1523
01:18:13.647 --> 01:18:15.648
She asked me to move in with her
and I hesitated.

1524
01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:16.915
It was like a no.

1525
01:18:16.916 --> 01:18:18.617
I should have said yes
right away, you know?

1526
01:18:18.618 --> 01:18:21.386
That's how the whole thing
got screwed up.

1527
01:18:21.387 --> 01:18:22.788
I broke the, uh, covenant.

1528
01:18:22.789 --> 01:18:24.623
Ever think things got screwed up

1529
01:18:24.624 --> 01:18:26.892
because you said yes
without thinking,

1530
01:18:26.893 --> 01:18:28.460
not because of a covenant
you made?

1531
01:18:28.461 --> 01:18:30.763
It's with the universe.
It's a big deal.

1532
01:18:30.764 --> 01:18:32.364
There is a middle ground here,
Carl.

1533
01:18:32.365 --> 01:18:34.800
You can process things.
You can weigh them individually

1534
01:18:34.801 --> 01:18:37.069
and make decisions
on a case-by-case basis

1535
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:38.771
a.k.a. what normal people do.

1536
01:18:38.772 --> 01:18:41.606
Yeah, that's a good point.
Hold that thought. Allison!

1537
01:18:41.607 --> 01:18:42.941
Or not.

1538
01:18:42.942 --> 01:18:45.010
Allison, please,
can't we talk for a sec?

1539
01:18:45.011 --> 01:18:46.745
Get away from me.
Okay.

1540
01:18:46.746 --> 01:18:49.015
Farther.
Yeah.

1541
01:18:50.684 --> 01:18:51.885
Carl.

1542
01:18:56.122 --> 01:18:58.056
Bye, Carl.

1543
01:18:58.057 --> 01:19:01.393
Oh, I just love good food.
So do I.

1544
01:19:01.394 --> 01:19:02.795
Do you?
Uh-huh.

1545
01:19:02.796 --> 01:19:05.463
You know you and I
are a lot alike?

1546
01:19:06.632 --> 01:19:09.501
My mother likes good food.

1547
01:19:09.502 --> 01:19:12.337
She always used to say,
"I'd rather eat good food

1548
01:19:12.338 --> 01:19:14.606
than bad food any old day
of the week."

1549
01:19:14.607 --> 01:19:16.508
Hey.

1550
01:19:16.509 --> 01:19:18.343
It's me again.

1551
01:19:18.344 --> 01:19:21.046
Specifically I'm talking
about 15 to 20 percent.

1552
01:19:21.047 --> 01:19:22.781
The way we're gonna
do this is we're...

1553
01:19:22.782 --> 01:19:26.819
* As the hours turn into days *

1554
01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:30.555
* Pretty soon Lost in the haze *

1555
01:19:30.556 --> 01:19:33.491
* It's up to you and me *

1556
01:19:33.492 --> 01:19:34.694
* And who's to say *

1557
01:19:37.897 --> 01:19:39.965
* These could be
The good old days *

1558
01:19:39.966 --> 01:19:43.702
Okay, I'm totally
off the controls.

1559
01:19:43.703 --> 01:19:46.439
You're officially
flying by yourself.

1560
01:19:48.074 --> 01:19:49.842
Cool.

1561
01:19:49.843 --> 01:19:53.079
There's no greater feeling
in the world, is there?

1562
01:19:56.249 --> 01:19:58.884
Hello, Jake, Rodrigo,

1563
01:19:58.885 --> 01:20:01.754
Penelope, Phillip, Zachary.

1564
01:20:01.755 --> 01:20:03.756
I'd like to thank
you all for coming

1565
01:20:03.757 --> 01:20:07.025
for no other reason than
you genuinely wanted to.

1566
01:20:07.026 --> 01:20:08.360
In an unrelated note,

1567
01:20:08.361 --> 01:20:10.896
everyone else can
go jump off a bridge.

1568
01:20:41.795 --> 01:20:43.561
Allison?

1569
01:20:43.562 --> 01:20:45.663
No, it's Wes P., Big C.

1570
01:20:45.664 --> 01:20:47.833
Did I catch you at a bad time?

1571
01:20:47.834 --> 01:20:50.202
No, no, I'm just hanging here.

1572
01:20:50.203 --> 01:20:53.005
Okay, okay. Just checking in.

1573
01:20:53.006 --> 01:20:54.639
Seeing how Corporate's
treating you.

1574
01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:57.009
Kicks the crap out of dealing
with those peons, huh?

1575
01:20:57.010 --> 01:20:58.811
Well, I never really
thought of them as...

1576
01:20:58.812 --> 01:21:01.447
Hang on, hang on,
hang on, just a second.

1577
01:21:03.783 --> 01:21:04.850
Wes?

1578
01:21:05.985 --> 01:21:06.985
Can you hear me?

1579
01:21:06.986 --> 01:21:08.553
Go get the ball!

1580
01:21:08.554 --> 01:21:10.255
So listen, I got a job for you.

1581
01:21:10.256 --> 01:21:12.024
We're shutting down
a bunch of branches

1582
01:21:12.025 --> 01:21:13.691
and I need you
to tell the managers.

1583
01:21:13.692 --> 01:21:15.227
Shutting down branches?

1584
01:21:15.228 --> 01:21:16.294
Mm-hm.

1585
01:21:16.295 --> 01:21:18.197
Which ones?

1586
01:21:19.598 --> 01:21:22.567
We are Sparta!

1587
01:21:25.905 --> 01:21:27.572
Hi, Norm.

1588
01:21:48.261 --> 01:21:51.930
You have three messages.

1589
01:21:51.931 --> 01:21:55.100
Hi, Car,
this is your answer phone speaking.

1590
01:21:55.101 --> 01:21:56.501
Ha-ha, no, it's me, Norm,

1591
01:21:56.502 --> 01:21:58.136
just a reminder about
the party tonight.

1592
01:21:58.137 --> 01:21:59.671
I'll see you there, buddy.

1593
01:21:59.672 --> 01:22:01.439
Roger, out, ha-ha.

1594
01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.275
Carl, it's Roons.

1595
01:22:03.276 --> 01:22:04.843
Thanks for letting me
use your car.

1596
01:22:04.844 --> 01:22:07.045
You might notice that
the front bumper is missing.

1597
01:22:07.046 --> 01:22:08.113
Not to worry though.

1598
01:22:08.114 --> 01:22:09.381
I gave them your insurance.

1599
01:22:09.382 --> 01:22:10.983
The whole thing's being handled.

1600
01:22:10.984 --> 01:22:12.717
Oh, and I left a pile
of laundry in my room.

1601
01:22:12.718 --> 01:22:13.818
Don't forget, no starch.

1602
01:22:13.819 --> 01:22:14.853
Love you.

1603
01:22:16.155 --> 01:22:17.722
It's Peter.

1604
01:22:17.723 --> 01:22:19.491
I'm sure you're aware
and completely on top of it.

1605
01:22:19.492 --> 01:22:21.226
Just wanted to make sure
Lucy's shower

1606
01:22:21.227 --> 01:22:23.161
is still on for tomorrow night.

1607
01:22:23.162 --> 01:22:25.563
Haven't received confirmation
of any sort from you.

1608
01:22:25.564 --> 01:22:26.664
At all.

1609
01:22:26.665 --> 01:22:29.201
Shower. Shit.
It's on.

1610
01:22:29.202 --> 01:22:31.569
All Right? Call me.

1611
01:22:42.748 --> 01:22:44.482
Oh, hey, guys.

1612
01:22:44.483 --> 01:22:45.750
Hey.
What's wrong?

1613
01:22:45.751 --> 01:22:47.785
I just really need
to talk to you.

1614
01:22:47.786 --> 01:22:49.154
Why?

1615
01:22:49.155 --> 01:22:52.091
Come on inside.
I'll explain everything.

1616
01:22:57.763 --> 01:22:59.631
Surprise!

1617
01:22:59.632 --> 01:23:01.066
Oh, my God.
What?

1618
01:23:01.067 --> 01:23:02.234
Happy shower.

1619
01:23:02.235 --> 01:23:03.768
How did you pull this off?

1620
01:23:03.769 --> 01:23:06.804
I just called in a few favors,
kept throwing money at it.

1621
01:23:06.805 --> 01:23:09.841
I like it, I like it.

1622
01:23:09.842 --> 01:23:11.276
Rooney.
Congratulations.

1623
01:23:11.277 --> 01:23:12.810
That's Bert. He's in fertilizer.

1624
01:23:12.811 --> 01:23:14.346
Hey, B.
And Lee, he's a male nurse.

1625
01:23:14.347 --> 01:23:15.981
I know Lee.

1626
01:23:15.982 --> 01:23:19.451
Let's get this guy a drink.
He doesn't have long to live.

1627
01:23:19.452 --> 01:23:21.786
On him, on him.

1628
01:23:24.857 --> 01:23:25.857
Cake?

1629
01:23:25.858 --> 01:23:27.092
Thanks.
Sure.

1630
01:23:27.093 --> 01:23:29.928
Oh, John Goodman.

1631
01:23:29.929 --> 01:23:32.031
No, it's Alec Baldwin.

1632
01:23:33.366 --> 01:23:34.933
Oh, right.

1633
01:23:34.934 --> 01:23:36.469
Nailed it.

1634
01:23:42.708 --> 01:23:43.708
Norm.

1635
01:23:43.709 --> 01:23:46.844
Hey, thanks for coming, man.

1636
01:23:46.845 --> 01:23:47.845
How you holding up?

1637
01:23:47.846 --> 01:23:49.847
I'm okay, Car.

1638
01:23:49.848 --> 01:23:52.717
You know, taking her day by day.

1639
01:23:52.718 --> 01:23:55.920
Yeah. Well, I got a friend
I want you to meet.

1640
01:23:55.921 --> 01:23:57.689
Oh.

1641
01:24:01.594 --> 01:24:04.196
Norman, this is Soo-Mi.

1642
01:24:04.197 --> 01:24:06.399
Oh, hi, there.

1643
01:24:07.967 --> 01:24:09.901
Can I call you Soo?

1644
01:24:09.902 --> 01:24:12.470
Ha-ha, yes.
Ah.

1645
01:24:12.471 --> 01:24:13.538
Do you dance?

1646
01:24:13.539 --> 01:24:15.707
Well, I've won
some competitions.

1647
01:24:15.708 --> 01:24:16.808
Watch this.

1648
01:24:16.809 --> 01:24:18.843
Come on!
Whoa, what? Oh.

1649
01:24:18.844 --> 01:24:20.113
Hey.

1650
01:24:46.472 --> 01:24:48.773
Oh, that's an interesting one.

1651
01:24:48.774 --> 01:24:52.045
Yep, and it's half-price, so...

1652
01:24:56.649 --> 01:24:58.783
Oh, jeez.

1653
01:24:58.784 --> 01:25:00.818
That's the best
wedding shower ever, man.

1654
01:25:00.819 --> 01:25:02.387
Ah, man, you deserve it.

1655
01:25:02.388 --> 01:25:04.456
You all right?
Yeah. Yeah.

1656
01:25:04.457 --> 01:25:06.391
Yeah? She's still not
calling you back?

1657
01:25:06.392 --> 01:25:07.925
No.

1658
01:25:07.926 --> 01:25:09.427
What are you gonna do?

1659
01:25:09.428 --> 01:25:10.462
I don't know.

1660
01:25:10.463 --> 01:25:12.197
I guess I'll just
stick with the program.

1661
01:25:12.198 --> 01:25:14.866
Keep saying yes to everything.

1662
01:25:14.867 --> 01:25:16.334
I know it sounds silly,

1663
01:25:16.335 --> 01:25:19.271
but maybe all that bad stuff
will lead to something good.

1664
01:25:19.272 --> 01:25:21.273
Doesn't sound silly.

1665
01:25:21.274 --> 01:25:23.675
Well, maybe a little silly.

1666
01:25:23.676 --> 01:25:26.078
You wanna get dinner
tomorrow night?

1667
01:25:26.079 --> 01:25:27.212
Yes.
Great.

1668
01:25:27.213 --> 01:25:29.047
But not because I have to.

1669
01:25:29.048 --> 01:25:30.415
But you do have to.

1670
01:25:30.416 --> 01:25:31.550
Yeah.

1671
01:25:32.818 --> 01:25:33.818
But you want to.

1672
01:25:33.819 --> 01:25:35.820
Oh, yeah.
Oh.

1673
01:25:35.821 --> 01:25:37.222
So bad.
Oh, God, me too.

1674
01:25:37.223 --> 01:25:39.091
Oh, it's all I can think about.

1675
01:25:39.092 --> 01:25:40.626
Really?

1676
01:25:45.864 --> 01:25:47.232
Hi, there.

1677
01:25:47.233 --> 01:25:51.069
Hello, there.

1678
01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:52.970
You must be Tillie.

1679
01:25:52.971 --> 01:25:55.073
Mm.

1680
01:25:55.074 --> 01:25:58.243
I've, uh, certainly
heard a lot about you.

1681
01:25:58.244 --> 01:26:00.212
Oh, isn't that nice?

1682
01:26:02.715 --> 01:26:06.151
Would you mind helping me?

1683
01:26:06.152 --> 01:26:09.322
Absolutely, yeah. No problem.

1684
01:26:10.656 --> 01:26:12.525
Come on, let's go.

1685
01:26:22.735 --> 01:26:23.835
Hello?

1686
01:26:23.836 --> 01:26:25.337
Hi, Carl.

1687
01:26:25.338 --> 01:26:28.906
Hello, Stephanie.
What's wrong?

1688
01:26:28.907 --> 01:26:32.410
Can you come over?

1689
01:26:32.411 --> 01:26:34.779
We had this big fight
and he stormed off.

1690
01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:39.016
Well, these things have a way
of working themselves out.

1691
01:26:39.017 --> 01:26:41.519
I don't know.

1692
01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:44.122
Not this time.
I think it's over.

1693
01:26:44.123 --> 01:26:45.724
Yeah?

1694
01:26:46.792 --> 01:26:49.494
You know,
maybe it's supposed to be.

1695
01:26:49.495 --> 01:26:52.264
I mean, a part of me
felt like something

1696
01:26:52.265 --> 01:26:54.031
wasn't right from the beginning.

1697
01:26:54.032 --> 01:26:55.233
Yeah?

1698
01:26:55.234 --> 01:26:58.170
I don't know, Carl.
I'm so confused.

1699
01:26:58.171 --> 01:26:59.404
Yeah.

1700
01:26:59.405 --> 01:27:05.009
I'm gonna assume
at this point, well...

1701
01:27:05.010 --> 01:27:06.010
Stay with me tonight.

1702
01:27:06.011 --> 01:27:07.579
Oh, Steph, uh.

1703
01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:08.781
Mm.

1704
01:27:12.851 --> 01:27:14.287
Steph.

1705
01:27:15.053 --> 01:27:17.755
I can't.

1706
01:27:17.756 --> 01:27:19.525
I'm sorry.

1707
01:27:21.927 --> 01:27:23.862
What are you saying?

1708
01:27:25.564 --> 01:27:27.865
I'm saying no.

1709
01:27:42.815 --> 01:27:45.817
Oh, God, are you serious?

1710
01:27:59.465 --> 01:28:01.065
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1711
01:28:05.604 --> 01:28:06.939
Ow.

1712
01:28:08.707 --> 01:28:10.676
Oh, please.

1713
01:28:11.544 --> 01:28:13.278
I didn't even see the red zone.

1714
01:28:13.279 --> 01:28:15.380
I've only been here
for 20 minutes.

1715
01:28:15.381 --> 01:28:17.249
Sorry, pal. Can't help you.

1716
01:28:17.250 --> 01:28:19.617
Oh, come on.
Can't you give me a break?

1717
01:28:19.618 --> 01:28:23.588
No, man, no, man, no, man.

1718
01:28:23.589 --> 01:28:25.723
No man, no man, no man...

1719
01:28:25.724 --> 01:28:27.326
Not possible!

1720
01:28:29.995 --> 01:28:31.964
Jackoff.

1721
01:28:33.366 --> 01:28:39.070
Chapter 26, "Words
Which Rhyme With Yes."

1722
01:28:39.071 --> 01:28:41.906
Guess, mess.

1723
01:28:41.907 --> 01:28:44.141
Tess, that's a name.

1724
01:28:44.142 --> 01:28:47.845
Less, a word and a name.

1725
01:28:47.846 --> 01:28:50.181
Terrence, don't freak out.
What the fuck?

1726
01:29:14.573 --> 01:29:17.610
Jesus, that nurse couldn't
be any more obvious.

1727
01:29:18.644 --> 01:29:19.977
She was coming in the room.

1728
01:29:19.978 --> 01:29:22.580
It's like, pft,
"Give me some space, woman."

1729
01:29:22.581 --> 01:29:25.717
Again, I'm pretty sure she
was just here checking on Carl.

1730
01:29:25.718 --> 01:29:27.719
Ha, Peter.

1731
01:29:29.221 --> 01:29:31.122
Uh, a covenant.

1732
01:29:31.123 --> 01:29:33.458
Hey, buddy, you all right?

1733
01:29:33.459 --> 01:29:34.792
The covenant.

1734
01:29:34.793 --> 01:29:36.928
It's coming down
hard on me, man.

1735
01:29:36.929 --> 01:29:39.831
God, he keeps talking
about this covenant nonsense.

1736
01:29:39.832 --> 01:29:40.699
It's not nonsense.

1737
01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:42.568
It is nonsense.

1738
01:29:44.069 --> 01:29:45.270
It's him.

1739
01:29:47.172 --> 01:29:48.473
Oh, thank God, Terrence.

1740
01:29:48.474 --> 01:29:50.107
You have to remove the covenant.

1741
01:29:50.108 --> 01:29:51.509
It's killing me.

1742
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:52.644
First of all.

1743
01:29:52.645 --> 01:29:54.479
What were you doing in my car?

1744
01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:57.181
I told you, I need you
to remove the covenant.

1745
01:29:57.182 --> 01:29:58.182
There is no covenant.

1746
01:29:58.183 --> 01:29:59.617
There never was.

1747
01:29:59.618 --> 01:30:01.119
I was just riffing.

1748
01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:04.088
Riffing?
Well, I had to say something.

1749
01:30:04.089 --> 01:30:05.390
You were being difficult.

1750
01:30:05.391 --> 01:30:07.559
Embarrassing me
in front of my crowd.

1751
01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:10.061
So the whole yes thing
is all bullshit?

1752
01:30:10.062 --> 01:30:11.496
No.

1753
01:30:11.497 --> 01:30:13.264
You just don't know how
to use it, that's all.

1754
01:30:13.265 --> 01:30:14.632
Yeah, I do.

1755
01:30:14.633 --> 01:30:16.634
Say yes to everything.
Real tough to grasp.

1756
01:30:16.635 --> 01:30:18.770
No, that's not the point.

1757
01:30:18.771 --> 01:30:20.372
Well, maybe at first it is,

1758
01:30:20.373 --> 01:30:22.940
but that's just
to open you up to it.

1759
01:30:22.941 --> 01:30:24.576
To get you started.

1760
01:30:24.577 --> 01:30:27.412
Then you're saying yes,
not because you have to,

1761
01:30:27.413 --> 01:30:29.914
not because a covenant
tells you to, but...

1762
01:30:29.915 --> 01:30:33.352
Because you know in your
heart that you want to.

1763
01:30:34.252 --> 01:30:36.454
Yeah.

1764
01:30:36.455 --> 01:30:39.023
You're right.

1765
01:30:39.024 --> 01:30:40.658
That makes perfect sense.

1766
01:30:40.659 --> 01:30:42.560
Told you, I said that.
You didn't say that.

1767
01:30:42.561 --> 01:30:44.095
I did.
You didn't say it like that.

1768
01:30:44.096 --> 01:30:46.364
I didn't say it with an accent,
but I said...

1769
01:30:46.365 --> 01:30:47.699
Thanks, Terrence.

1770
01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:51.068
Sorry about the car,
and your head there.

1771
01:30:51.069 --> 01:30:52.504
What time is it?

1772
01:30:52.505 --> 01:30:55.807
It's 5:40 in the morning.

1773
01:30:55.808 --> 01:30:57.342
Perfect.

1774
01:30:59.478 --> 01:31:00.679
I said that.

1775
01:31:01.847 --> 01:31:02.848
Whatever.

1776
01:31:05.250 --> 01:31:08.387
I'm gonna hop in the bed just
in case the nurse comes back.

1777
01:31:10.723 --> 01:31:12.289
Shh.

1778
01:31:13.626 --> 01:31:14.892
Sir, you need
to get back to your room.

1779
01:31:14.893 --> 01:31:16.794
No, I don't.
Sir, stop right there.

1780
01:31:16.795 --> 01:31:18.195
Eat me.

1781
01:31:20.533 --> 01:31:23.000
Lee. What are you doing here?

1782
01:31:23.001 --> 01:31:24.836
I'm a nurse, remember?

1783
01:31:24.837 --> 01:31:26.438
Oh, yeah, right.

1784
01:31:26.439 --> 01:31:27.572
Sorry.

1785
01:31:27.573 --> 01:31:29.273
Can I borrow your car?

1786
01:31:29.274 --> 01:31:30.542
No, I don't have my car anymore.

1787
01:31:30.543 --> 01:31:33.945
I've got my Ducati,
thanks to you.

1788
01:31:33.946 --> 01:31:36.581
Du-ca-ti.

1789
01:31:41.386 --> 01:31:43.254
Have you ever driven
one of these before?

1790
01:31:43.255 --> 01:31:44.856
They're quite powerful.

1791
01:31:44.857 --> 01:31:48.359
Yeah, I ride double all the time
on the scooter with Allison.

1792
01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:50.762
No, Carl, this is not the same.

1793
01:31:50.763 --> 01:31:52.530
You really have to be careful.
Uh-huh.

1794
01:31:52.531 --> 01:31:54.099
Okay, these things
have a lot of...

1795
01:31:54.967 --> 01:31:57.068
Holy Jesus.

1796
01:31:57.069 --> 01:31:58.436
Torque.

1797
01:32:10.516 --> 01:32:11.516
How you doing?

1798
01:32:11.517 --> 01:32:13.017
Can't complain.

1799
01:32:13.018 --> 01:32:14.318
Aah!

1800
01:32:16.354 --> 01:32:18.355
You might wanna
get out of the way.

1801
01:32:29.468 --> 01:32:30.602
Come on. Jerk.

1802
01:32:30.603 --> 01:32:32.104
I'm sorry.

1803
01:32:44.617 --> 01:32:46.651
* Survive the tide *

1804
01:32:46.652 --> 01:32:50.655
* Love divides *

1805
01:32:50.656 --> 01:32:54.859
* Someday love will find you *

1806
01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:57.995
* Break those chains
That bind you *

1807
01:32:57.996 --> 01:33:01.165
* One night will remind you *

1808
01:33:01.166 --> 01:33:05.703
* How we touched
And went our separate ways *

1809
01:33:05.704 --> 01:33:10.575
* If he ever hurts you *

1810
01:33:10.576 --> 01:33:13.444
* True love won't desert you *

1811
01:33:13.445 --> 01:33:16.313
* You know I still love you *

1812
01:33:16.314 --> 01:33:20.753
* Though we touched
And went our separate ways *

1813
01:33:25.290 --> 01:33:27.793
What an asshole.

1814
01:33:43.676 --> 01:33:45.442
Carl, what are you doing here?

1815
01:33:45.443 --> 01:33:46.911
I just wanted to tell you

1816
01:33:46.912 --> 01:33:48.880
that I don't wanna
live with you.

1817
01:33:48.881 --> 01:33:50.181
Oh, wow.

1818
01:33:50.182 --> 01:33:52.717
Thanks.
My knight in shining armor.

1819
01:33:52.718 --> 01:33:55.654
Okay, people, let's go.

1820
01:33:58.356 --> 01:33:59.891
But I wanna be with you.

1821
01:33:59.892 --> 01:34:02.259
But I don't wanna be with you.
I don't even know who you are.

1822
01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:04.862
Everything I said I meant,
except about living together.

1823
01:34:04.863 --> 01:34:07.665
That makes me nervous,
but that's normal, it's big.

1824
01:34:07.666 --> 01:34:10.267
We shouldn't just jump
into that without thinking.

1825
01:34:10.268 --> 01:34:12.069
Why not?
You do it with everything.

1826
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:14.405
You just say yes, yes, yes,
to whatever comes your way.

1827
01:34:14.406 --> 01:34:15.673
That's not true.

1828
01:34:15.674 --> 01:34:17.141
You can say no if you
don't want something.

1829
01:34:17.142 --> 01:34:19.243
Oh, brilliant, Carl.
Where'd you get that?

1830
01:34:19.244 --> 01:34:20.311
Your literature?

1831
01:34:20.312 --> 01:34:22.614
Look, I know the philosophy
has some holes.

1832
01:34:22.615 --> 01:34:23.915
Oh, you think?

1833
01:34:23.916 --> 01:34:26.550
Seems pretty airtight to me.

1834
01:34:26.551 --> 01:34:27.719
But if I hadn't done that,

1835
01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:29.453
I never would have met you.

1836
01:34:29.454 --> 01:34:32.890
Because the old Carl didn't
think he was enough for anybody.

1837
01:34:32.891 --> 01:34:34.358
I thought if I said
yes to things

1838
01:34:34.359 --> 01:34:35.893
and got involved with people

1839
01:34:35.894 --> 01:34:38.630
sooner or later,
they'd find out I'm not enough.

1840
01:34:38.631 --> 01:34:41.432
I didn't think
I had anything to share,

1841
01:34:41.433 --> 01:34:44.535
but now I know that what I have
to share is pretty huge.

1842
01:34:44.536 --> 01:34:46.137
And I wanna share it with you.

1843
01:34:46.138 --> 01:34:47.872
Do you mind, Reggie?

1844
01:34:47.873 --> 01:34:48.873
Seriously, dude.

1845
01:34:48.874 --> 01:34:50.742
Sorry, this seemed interesting.

1846
01:34:50.743 --> 01:34:52.176
Even if I had met you,

1847
01:34:52.177 --> 01:34:53.778
I never would have
asked you out.

1848
01:34:53.779 --> 01:34:55.479
You were the complete
opposite of me.

1849
01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:57.181
You did things, and had friends,

1850
01:34:57.182 --> 01:35:00.584
and sang in rock bands,
and made life happen.

1851
01:35:00.585 --> 01:35:02.654
You weren't scared of anything.

1852
01:35:02.655 --> 01:35:05.522
You don't think
I'm scared of anything?

1853
01:35:05.523 --> 01:35:06.724
Who do you think I am?

1854
01:35:06.725 --> 01:35:08.793
I'm scared of a lot of things.

1855
01:35:08.794 --> 01:35:11.495
And I'm scared too.

1856
01:35:11.496 --> 01:35:13.866
So let's be scared together.

1857
01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:17.635
I don't know what
you want me to say.

1858
01:35:17.636 --> 01:35:19.704
So just say yes.

1859
01:35:19.705 --> 01:35:22.740
But only if you really want to.

1860
01:35:22.741 --> 01:35:24.175
And can you do it kind of soon?

1861
01:35:24.176 --> 01:35:26.144
I think I'm starting
to get a chill.

1862
01:35:27.279 --> 01:35:29.280
Yeah, I noticed that.

1863
01:35:29.281 --> 01:35:31.183
Well?

1864
01:35:32.450 --> 01:35:33.652
Um...

1865
01:35:37.923 --> 01:35:39.090
Maybe.

1866
01:35:39.091 --> 01:35:40.058
Come on.

1867
01:35:40.059 --> 01:35:42.994
I'm not gonna say that word.

1868
01:35:42.995 --> 01:35:44.830
Okay, maybe's fine.
Maybe's good.

1869
01:35:51.469 --> 01:35:53.337
I like maybe.

1870
01:35:53.338 --> 01:35:54.807
Reggie, come on.
Dude.

1871
01:36:21.266 --> 01:36:24.869
Excuse me, but pleats
are kind of out of style.

1872
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:27.238
You got anything
with a flat front?

1873
01:36:27.239 --> 01:36:29.540
Aw, Soo-Mi,
pleats are out?

1874
01:36:31.877 --> 01:36:33.410
Thanks, guys.

1875
01:36:33.411 --> 01:36:36.180
This is the single biggest
donation that we've ever had.

1876
01:36:36.181 --> 01:36:38.750
You're welcome, but it was Carl
that made it all happen.

1877
01:36:38.751 --> 01:36:40.617
Oh, you're a good man, Carl.

1878
01:36:40.618 --> 01:36:41.986
No big deal.

1879
01:36:41.987 --> 01:36:44.355
I know a lot of people
who are willing to give.

1880
01:36:47.292 --> 01:36:48.160
Say it a million times.

1881
01:36:48.161 --> 01:36:52.029
Say it a million more times.

1882
01:36:52.030 --> 01:36:56.700
And the word you will have said
two million times is:

1883
01:36:56.701 --> 01:36:59.171
Yes!

1884
01:37:04.542 --> 01:37:06.811
Good God.

1885
01:37:20.358 --> 01:37:21.725
* Click, click *

1886
01:37:21.726 --> 01:37:23.795
* Got you on my mind
It's stuck in gritty *

1887
01:37:23.796 --> 01:37:25.396
* Tough shit *

1888
01:37:25.397 --> 01:37:27.664
* Know somebody have you
Up in the city *

1889
01:37:27.665 --> 01:37:28.966
* Come on, get on *

1890
01:37:28.967 --> 01:37:30.667
* One moment In the right time *

1891
01:37:30.668 --> 01:37:32.103
* This is it *

1892
01:37:32.104 --> 01:37:36.074
* Is your life changing
Or is it mine? *

1893
01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:43.114
* Yes man *

1894
01:37:43.115 --> 01:37:44.681
* Let's go for a ride *

1895
01:37:44.682 --> 01:37:48.119
* There's so many lanes
That we could drive *

1896
01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:51.588
* There's so many rules
No need to abide *

1897
01:37:51.589 --> 01:37:52.656
* Throw my helmet on *

1898
01:37:52.657 --> 01:37:54.125
* Hold on tight *

1899
01:37:54.126 --> 01:37:56.360
* Oh, now you're mine All mine *

1900
01:37:56.361 --> 01:37:57.195
* Yes man *

1901
01:37:57.196 --> 01:37:58.762
* Let's go for a ride *

1902
01:37:58.763 --> 01:38:02.099
* There's so many lanes
That we could drive *

1903
01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:05.602
* There's so many rules
No need to abide *

1904
01:38:05.603 --> 01:38:06.938
* Throw my helmet on *

1905
01:38:06.939 --> 01:38:08.305
* Hold on tight *

1906
01:38:08.306 --> 01:38:11.443
* Oh, now you're mine All mine *

1907
01:38:16.714 --> 01:38:18.415
* Could this be it? *

1908
01:38:18.416 --> 01:38:20.717
* I'd like to think my mind
Could change on a dime *

1909
01:38:20.718 --> 01:38:22.286
* Just stick with it *

1910
01:38:22.287 --> 01:38:23.988
* See something different
Deep in your eyes *

1911
01:38:23.989 --> 01:38:25.489
* Cut the shit *

1912
01:38:25.490 --> 01:38:27.658
* This honesty
Could be modernized *

1913
01:38:27.659 --> 01:38:29.293
* Who you kidding? *

1914
01:38:29.294 --> 01:38:33.398
* Let's make it your place
Or how about mine? *

1915
01:38:40.772 --> 01:38:43.007
So anything else
we need to know?

1916
01:38:43.008 --> 01:38:44.541
Your instinct is gonna

1917
01:38:44.542 --> 01:38:47.378
be to brake with your
chin or your forehead.

1918
01:38:47.379 --> 01:38:48.379
Try to resist that.

1919
01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:50.882
Right.
Right.

1920
01:38:51.884 --> 01:38:53.250
Oh, and thanks for the loan.

1921
01:38:53.251 --> 01:38:55.353
I never could have finished
the suits without it.

1922
01:38:57.589 --> 01:38:59.823
Listen, I'm not gonna think
anything less of you

1923
01:38:59.824 --> 01:39:00.892
if you don't wanna do this.

1924
01:39:00.893 --> 01:39:02.293
What?

1925
01:39:02.294 --> 01:39:03.961
I mean, I'm still gonna
be attracted to you

1926
01:39:03.962 --> 01:39:05.329
if you're a little chicken.

1927
01:39:05.330 --> 01:39:06.864
What if I'm one
of those chickens

1928
01:39:06.865 --> 01:39:08.665
whose head doesn't
get cleanly severed

1929
01:39:08.666 --> 01:39:11.035
and my beak ends up
in the bucket?

1930
01:39:11.036 --> 01:39:12.103
I'll see you at the bottom.

1931
01:39:12.104 --> 01:39:14.571
Unless you pass out.

1932
01:39:14.572 --> 01:39:16.773
I told you,

* In my heart of hearts
I know it well *

1956
01:40:30.882 --> 01:40:35.287
* Been giving myself
The soft cell *

1957
01:40:37.889 --> 01:40:44.562
* Anyone can see
That I've been running away *

1958
01:40:46.364 --> 01:40:51.369

The blinds are down *

1965
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:24.236
* Me and my heart
Are out of town *

1966
01:41:26.104 --> 01:41:30.841

When I fell *

1976
01:42:30.502 --> 01:42:37.442
* Not licking wounds
But more like sewing them up *

1977
01:42:38.643 --> 01:42:43.648
* Man, it was rough for me *

1978
01:42:44.482 --> 01:42:46.983
