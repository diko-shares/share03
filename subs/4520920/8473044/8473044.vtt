00:00:22.563 --> 00:00:23.730
Hmm?

2
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.463
Whoa, why are you stoppin'?
Keep it goin', keep it goin'.

3
00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:30.297
- Wait, no.
- Keep it goin'.

4
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.340
- Wait, hold on.
- Uh, keep it goin'.

5
00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:32.883
Sequoia, wait!

6
00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:38.014
- What is that thing?
- Uh, a pervy little crab.

7
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.725
I don't know,
let him watch if he wants.

8
00:01:42.018 --> 00:01:44.061
Whatever floats your boat,
little dude.

9
00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.274
- Yeah, no.
- Ah, the fuck?

10
00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:58.033
That's disgusting.

11
00:01:58.326 --> 00:02:01.037
Don't freak out, it's dead.

12
00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.621
Babe, you gotta take a picture
with this.

13
00:02:02.913 --> 00:02:07.000
- No, I don't wanna touch it.
- Come on, just do it.

14
00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:09.502
- Fine.
- Yeah.

15
00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:11.421
- Just be quick!
- Okay.

16
00:02:12.923 --> 00:02:15.717
Okay, take it very slowly,
slowly.

17
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.844
Okay, okay, okay.

18
00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:18.303
Come on.

19
00:02:23.934 --> 00:02:26.353
Babe, you better put that down.

20
00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:31.317
Sequoia!

21
00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:37.072
- Babe.
- Oh.

22
00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:38.366
Hold on, Babe!

23
00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:39.241
Babe!

24
00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:57.384
Hon, are you okay?

25
00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:58.844
Babe?

26
00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:03.307
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:44.389
Hey, watch it! Motherfuckin' kids!

28
00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:19.091
Oh, no!

29
00:04:20.384 --> 00:04:22.177
Come on, fuckin' little crab.

30
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.555
How do you like them apples, sucker.

31
00:04:24.847 --> 00:04:25.973
Ha-ha!

32
00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:28.517
Oh, no, no, no!

33
00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:30.018
Shit!

34
00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:31.312
Hey, Deputy.

35
00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:33.021
Put your damn game down

36
00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:37.151
and pick up. Over.

37
00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:37.943
Sheriff, I'm here.

38
00:04:38.235 --> 00:04:39.861
I'm about to swing by Johnny B's

39
00:04:40.154 --> 00:04:41.655
and pick your brother up
some grub.

40
00:04:41.947 --> 00:04:43.657
- Want anything?
- Sheriff, hold on.

41
00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.325
Hey, Mr. West?

42
00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:46.744
Hey, Mr. West.

43
00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:48.954
Oh, no— Mr. West!

44
00:04:49.246 --> 00:04:50.205
Oh, not again.

45
00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:53.167
Dammit, Mr. West,
I just ate a breakfast burrito.

46
00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:54.793
Please slow down.

47
00:05:07.348 --> 00:05:09.433
Dammit, Hunter.

48
00:05:10.976 --> 00:05:12.811
Maddy, would you mind
taking that down?

49
00:05:13.103 --> 00:05:15.730
- Thank you.
- De nada.

50
00:05:22.446 --> 00:05:24.197
Hey, Maddy.

51
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.451
You remember that thing
I was telling you about?

52
00:05:27.743 --> 00:05:29.244
Yeah, is that it?

53
00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:30.120
Ah!

54
00:05:30.412 --> 00:05:32.080
Do you wanna try it out?

55
00:05:32.373 --> 00:05:33.999
- Let's do it.
- Good!

56
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.169
This changes everything, Maddy.

57
00:05:37.461 --> 00:05:40.130
All my effort is finally
gonna pay off.

58
00:05:40.422 --> 00:05:41.005
Our effort.

59
00:05:41.298 --> 00:05:42.674
You know
that's what I meant.

60
00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:44.051
Do you really think it'll work?

61
00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:44.676
It better.

62
00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.845
I had to convince Flannigan

63
00:05:47.137 --> 00:05:50.974
to bribe four customs agents
just to get it into the country.

64
00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:52.434
Uh, really?

65
00:05:52.726 --> 00:05:53.059
Oh, yeah!

66
00:05:53.352 --> 00:05:54.936
See, what's in this box
could theoretically fuel

67
00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:59.729
a military-grade giant robot,
10 stories tall, for weeks.

68
00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:02.402
Phil, just in case
it doesn't work,

69
00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:05.072
you know life will go
on either way, right?

70
00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:06.323
Whether you're able to walk—

71
00:06:06.615 --> 00:06:07.490
It'll work.

72
00:06:07.783 --> 00:06:08.408
- Trust me.
- I do.

73
00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:09.702
I'm just sayin', don't forget,

74
00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:10.911
you'll always
have two left feet.

75
00:06:11.203 --> 00:06:12.662
Oh, hey, Maddy,
would you mind, um—

76
00:06:12.955 --> 00:06:15.749
- Oh, you want 'em?
- Yeah.

77
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:17.167
- You want 'em ?
- Yes.

78
00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:18.918
Then stand up and get 'em.

79
00:06:19.211 --> 00:06:20.503
Oh, that's not cool.

80
00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:27.511
- Thanks.
- No problemo.

81
00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:37.896
It's dusty as shit in here,
Phil.

82
00:06:38.188 --> 00:06:41.149
Yeah, it's a barn.

83
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.737
Hope you're ready for this.

84
00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:49.991
Oh.

85
00:06:50.284 --> 00:06:54.746
Get this, it is only mapped
to my thumbprint.

86
00:06:57.708 --> 00:06:58.875
Whoa!

87
00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:01.211
There we go.

88
00:07:02.296 --> 00:07:04.965
Wow!

89
00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:08.177
All right.

90
00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:16.268
Amorium Clustergram.

91
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.187
In all of her beauty.

92
00:07:21.106 --> 00:07:22.816
Ready?

93
00:07:23.817 --> 00:07:24.484
Okay.

94
00:07:31.408 --> 00:07:31.825
Yeah.

95
00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:38.457
Bloody fartin' Jesus!

96
00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:40.041
Flannigan!

97
00:07:40.334 --> 00:07:42.210
What the hell was that, Phil?

98
00:07:42.503 --> 00:07:44.463
Damn near blew my nuts off.

99
00:07:44.755 --> 00:07:46.548
Not like you get much use
out of 'em anymore.

100
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.215
- Hey, now.
- Yeah.

101
00:07:47.508 --> 00:07:49.885
That's a nice thank you for me
bringing you supper.

102
00:07:50.177 --> 00:07:51.261
- Oh, thanks.
- Hi, Flannigan.

103
00:07:51.553 --> 00:07:54.514
Maddy Menrath,
you're not encouraging him now,

104
00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:55.098
are you?

105
00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:57.518
Says the man who helped him
procure the damn thing.

106
00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.312
Oh, is that what that was?

107
00:08:00.604 --> 00:08:01.479
Maybe.

108
00:08:01.772 --> 00:08:03.440
Hey, how come you don't just
use your old man's shop

109
00:08:03.732 --> 00:08:06.735
instead of holding yourself up
in your little cubby, huh?

110
00:08:07.027 --> 00:08:09.195
Have everything
I need in my cubby.

111
00:08:10.531 --> 00:08:10.948
Well, I'm just sayin'.

112
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.284
It's a shame to let
all that stuff go unused.

113
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:15.869
Doesn't matter.

114
00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:18.371
Hunter's gonna sell it
all anyway.

115
00:08:19.206 --> 00:08:20.916
Might oughta patch
that hole up though

116
00:08:21.208 --> 00:08:23.919
before your brother gets back.

117
00:08:24.211 --> 00:08:26.129
Wup, you're fucked.

118
00:08:28.048 --> 00:08:29.466
Howdy, Partner?

119
00:08:31.343 --> 00:08:32.469
Sheriff.

120
00:08:36.557 --> 00:08:39.643
Phil, will you quit ripping up
the damn signs?

121
00:08:39.935 --> 00:08:41.478
I'm not.

122
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:43.855
You're not.

123
00:08:44.148 --> 00:08:45.482
Then who is?

124
00:08:46.233 --> 00:08:48.193
- Maddy.
- Hey!

125
00:08:48.485 --> 00:08:49.360
You told me to.

126
00:08:49.653 --> 00:08:52.489
You know we can't afford
to keep this place.

127
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.911
Take it easy, Deputy.

128
00:08:58.579 --> 00:08:59.871
All available units,

129
00:09:00.164 --> 00:09:04.251
we have a 19-243 down
on Lunar Beach.

130
00:09:05.961 --> 00:09:06.753
What?

131
00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:08.714
19-243?

132
00:09:09.006 --> 00:09:10.298
That's a cat in a tree.

133
00:09:12.593 --> 00:09:14.386
Marjory, we've talked
about this

134
00:09:14.678 --> 00:09:16.179
and nobody else
is on these channels,

135
00:09:16.472 --> 00:09:19.683
so stop usin'
the frickin' codes.

136
00:09:19.975 --> 00:09:21.309
Ain't got time for it.

137
00:09:21.602 --> 00:09:22.227
Sorry, Sheriff.

138
00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:26.439
A dead whale washed up
with a nasty slice in its belly.

139
00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:29.359
Bunch of folks called it
in all freaked out.

140
00:09:29.651 --> 00:09:31.527
Cat in a tree, huh?

141
00:09:32.696 --> 00:09:34.197
Let's roll, Deputy!

142
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.451
Phil, please go hang this up.

143
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.335
You okay?

144
00:09:47.628 --> 00:09:49.004
Yeah, I'm okay.

145
00:09:50.714 --> 00:09:53.133
See you tomorrow.

146
00:09:53.425 --> 00:09:54.634
Sure.

147
00:09:55.135 --> 00:09:57.762
Not like we had plans
or anything.

148
00:10:01.475 --> 00:10:03.351
That is one big ass

149
00:10:03.644 --> 00:10:06.730
dead motherfuckin' whale. Wooh!

150
00:10:07.022 --> 00:10:09.482
Smells like fresh asshole, too.

151
00:10:13.153 --> 00:10:16.698
Oh, sure as hell wasn't no shark
done that.

152
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.409
Yeah, I'm guessin' not.

153
00:10:20.661 --> 00:10:22.579
Giant squid maybe?

154
00:10:22.871 --> 00:10:25.039
Those aren't real.

155
00:10:25.332 --> 00:10:26.541
Are they?

156
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.418
How the fuck would I know?

157
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:32.255
I look like a guy
who knows jack about fish?

158
00:10:32.548 --> 00:10:34.258
Fish sticks maybe.

159
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:37.552
I've been workin‘ out.

160
00:10:39.429 --> 00:10:41.514
I'm gonna go poke it
with a stick.

161
00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:43.433
Hey, don't be pokin‘ it
with a stick!

162
00:10:43.725 --> 00:10:44.851
It's a scientific observation.

163
00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:45.519
I saw it in a movie once.

164
00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:48.104
Don't be pokin' at shit.

165
00:10:57.281 --> 00:10:59.241
You know what I think did it?

166
00:10:59.533 --> 00:11:01.117
What?

167
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.161
Aliens.

168
00:11:03.912 --> 00:11:05.622
For sure.

169
00:11:06.039 --> 00:11:10.539
Truth is somethings out there.

170
00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:12.838
That's for damn sure.

171
00:11:16.008 --> 00:11:16.883
This thing stinks.

172
00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:17.718
Let's get out of here.

173
00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:18.635
Yeah.

174
00:11:18.927 --> 00:11:20.678
I'll buy you some fish sticks
for lunch.

175
00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:22.013
Oh!

176
00:11:40.908 --> 00:11:42.492
Ahhh.

177
00:11:46.872 --> 00:11:49.207
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

178
00:11:49.499 --> 00:11:50.958
Good mornin'.

179
00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:05.348
Ugh.

180
00:12:09.102 --> 00:12:11.145
Yeah?

181
00:12:11.438 --> 00:12:11.688
It's me.

182
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.898
Don't come in,
I'm jerking off.

183
00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:17.027
Shut up, I'm comin' in.

184
00:12:21.448 --> 00:12:22.615
Can I help you?

185
00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:24.576
Breakfast pizza?

186
00:12:24.868 --> 00:12:25.743
Gross.

187
00:12:26.036 --> 00:12:29.539
So, dude, uh, what the hell
happened to the door?

188
00:12:29.831 --> 00:12:32.250
I don't know
what you're talking about.

189
00:12:33.669 --> 00:12:35.462
Don't be difficult.

190
00:12:36.797 --> 00:12:38.799
Just fix it, okay?

191
00:12:45.138 --> 00:12:46.180
Right.

192
00:12:46.473 --> 00:12:48.016
Good talk, Phil.

193
00:13:15.168 --> 00:13:16.752
Mm, that is gross.

194
00:13:18.588 --> 00:13:19.839
Oh.

195
00:13:42.237 --> 00:13:42.946
What up, flake?

196
00:13:43.238 --> 00:13:44.030
Hey, Maddy, I'm sorry.

197
00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:47.826
- I got caught up.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

198
00:13:48.118 --> 00:13:50.662
My only demand
is unquestionable rights

199
00:13:50.954 --> 00:13:52.664
to the movie choice next week.

200
00:13:52.956 --> 00:13:54.666
Okay, but I refuse
to watch anything that—

201
00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:55.708
Oh, oh, oh, no, no.

202
00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:57.377
No exceptions.

203
00:13:58.295 --> 00:13:59.754
Fine.

204
00:14:01.089 --> 00:14:02.799
You know, you can wait for me
at the top.

205
00:14:03.091 --> 00:14:04.300
Like I can do this myself.

206
00:14:04.593 --> 00:14:07.637
Mm, pushing your lazy ass
around is the only workout

207
00:14:07.929 --> 00:14:08.638
I can handle.

208
00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.723
Seriously, fuck running.

209
00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:12.183
Next.

210
00:14:34.456 --> 00:14:35.498
Next.

211
00:14:38.418 --> 00:14:38.960
No heads up this morning?

212
00:14:39.252 --> 00:14:41.671
"Oh, hey, we're gonna be
playin' with dead things today.

213
00:14:41.963 --> 00:14:45.174
Maybe don't wear
your favorite shirt!" No?

214
00:14:46.468 --> 00:14:47.635
Thanks, Mom.

215
00:14:47.928 --> 00:14:48.678
Have fun.

216
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:49.679
All right, now everyone

217
00:14:49.971 --> 00:14:52.848
has one specimen per group,
right?

218
00:14:53.141 --> 00:14:56.310
If you look at the diagram
in your lab packet,

219
00:14:56.603 --> 00:14:57.604
- you'll see the instructions—
- So...

220
00:14:57.896 --> 00:14:58.396
Are clearly labeled.

221
00:14:58.688 --> 00:15:00.773
That's a mighty ﬁne
pussy you got there.

222
00:15:01.066 --> 00:15:02.233
- Ew!
- I am so sorry.

223
00:15:02.526 --> 00:15:03.693
That was— that was awful.

224
00:15:03.985 --> 00:15:06.570
Oh, please be careful
with the scalpel.

225
00:15:06.863 --> 00:15:08.656
And make sure you pin down
the extremities.

226
00:15:10.283 --> 00:15:11.909
Oh, Radu!

227
00:15:12.202 --> 00:15:13.745
I thought you were gonna
warn me next time.

228
00:15:14.037 --> 00:15:18.537
Uh, I is sorry Ms. Menrath,
but these things Radu cannot.

229
00:15:18.834 --> 00:15:20.669
But— the garbage
is three feet away.

230
00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:22.796
You used to think he was cute?

231
00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:27.588
Aw, is someone feline
jealous?

232
00:15:28.927 --> 00:15:30.219
Come on, you know
where the health office is.

233
00:15:30.512 --> 00:15:32.514
Come on.

234
00:15:32.806 --> 00:15:34.140
Leave it.

235
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.894
Feel better, all right?

236
00:15:38.186 --> 00:15:40.479
Thanks, Mindy.

237
00:15:40.772 --> 00:15:43.816
- How's it going over here?
- Fine, Mom.

238
00:15:44.109 --> 00:15:44.400
Go away.

239
00:15:44.693 --> 00:15:47.195
Hush, Daughter, maybe I wanted
to talk to Mr. McCalister.

240
00:15:47.487 --> 00:15:49.614
Oh, if this is about
the Geiger counter incident,

241
00:15:49.906 --> 00:15:50.489
- I'm— I'm—
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

242
00:15:50.782 --> 00:15:52.366
I see that you didn't sign
the registration sheet

243
00:15:52.659 --> 00:15:54.911
for the dance yet,
and I know Maddy doesn't—

244
00:15:55.203 --> 00:15:56.204
Mom!

245
00:15:56.496 --> 00:15:58.831
Ferme la Douche.

246
00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:00.959
Seriously, go away!

247
00:16:01.251 --> 00:16:02.377
All right, fine.

248
00:16:02.669 --> 00:16:03.920
Get over yourself.

249
00:16:19.436 --> 00:16:21.271
What up, Philibuster?

250
00:16:21.563 --> 00:16:23.856
Hey, I gotta ask you something.

251
00:16:24.149 --> 00:16:26.651
Good after the lunchtime,
my classmate Phalup.

252
00:16:26.943 --> 00:16:27.276
Hi, Radu.

253
00:16:27.569 --> 00:16:29.862
Hey, hey, good after the
lunchtime to you, too, Madeline.

254
00:16:30.155 --> 00:16:33.408
I am have begging your pardon,
but Radu is in this time

255
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.869
not having a lady partner
for the disco evening

256
00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:37.495
in days coming.

257
00:16:37.787 --> 00:16:40.748
Uh, uh, Radu have asked
many female classmates,

258
00:16:41.041 --> 00:16:44.627
and have many female classmates
said, "Radu, no way."

259
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.256
Thanks, Radu,
but I already have a date.

260
00:16:48.548 --> 00:16:50.216
- You do?
- Yes, you.

261
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:51.968
But he cannot walk.

262
00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.595
Mmhmm.

263
00:16:56.973 --> 00:16:59.475
Uh, but in serious,
Phallus cannot,

264
00:16:59.768 --> 00:17:02.812
for life of him,
disco simple hokey-pokey.

265
00:17:03.104 --> 00:17:05.064
You'd be surprised!

266
00:17:11.655 --> 00:17:13.448
You smell like a mermaid.

267
00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.421
America.

268
00:17:45.188 --> 00:17:47.231
This is super fucked up.

269
00:17:47.524 --> 00:17:49.651
Stop messing with the evidence,
Deputy.

270
00:17:49.943 --> 00:17:53.029
I was just—
sorry, sir.

271
00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:58.034
Well, goes that way.

272
00:17:58.326 --> 00:17:59.660
Shall we?

273
00:18:00.745 --> 00:18:02.955
What do you think
could have done it?

274
00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:04.958
Well...

275
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.292
I think a seal.

276
00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:08.878
- A what?
- A seal!

277
00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:12.715
If it was a seal,
there'd be flapper tracks.

278
00:18:13.675 --> 00:18:15.968
I guess that's right.

279
00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:16.761
Maybe he covered 'em up, though.

280
00:18:17.053 --> 00:18:18.345
I hear
they're highly intelligent.

281
00:18:18.638 --> 00:18:20.723
Ever heard of a man-eating seal?

282
00:18:21.016 --> 00:18:21.391
Don't rule it out.

283
00:18:21.683 --> 00:18:22.850
I heard they can be vicious, man.

284
00:18:23.143 --> 00:18:24.144
Think again, dumb ass.

285
00:18:24.436 --> 00:18:26.938
Okay, all right, fine,
I'll drop it.

286
00:18:28.398 --> 00:18:29.357
Watch your step.

287
00:18:29.649 --> 00:18:32.234
Tide hasn't washed away
the blood yet.

288
00:18:32.527 --> 00:18:33.903
Yep.

289
00:18:34.195 --> 00:18:38.240
All right then.
Get on up in there.

290
00:18:39.326 --> 00:18:41.328
I'll cover you from back here.

291
00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.039
Fine.

292
00:19:38.551 --> 00:19:40.386
Uh, fuck.

293
00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:42.514
What the fuck!

294
00:19:44.224 --> 00:19:47.352
Oh, God, what the fuck is this?

295
00:20:01.366 --> 00:20:02.909
Excuse me.

296
00:20:03.201 --> 00:20:04.076
Miss?

297
00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:05.953
Miss, are you all right?

298
00:20:06.246 --> 00:20:07.538
Miss?

299
00:20:07.831 --> 00:20:08.957
Excuse me.

300
00:20:09.249 --> 00:20:09.999
Miss.

301
00:20:10.291 --> 00:20:13.168
- Miss.
- Crabs!

302
00:20:16.756 --> 00:20:17.882
Crabs.

303
00:20:24.013 --> 00:20:25.180
Sheriff!

304
00:20:26.266 --> 00:20:27.558
Sheriff!

305
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.688
And then his mother
shook the goat and said to Radu,

306
00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.692
"Radu, now you must clean
father's dirty hole."

307
00:20:36.776 --> 00:20:40.029
Can friends guess
what Radu do after this?

308
00:20:40.321 --> 00:20:42.114
What the fuck you talking about,
dude?

309
00:20:42.407 --> 00:20:46.907
The question I is asking
is what do Radu do,

310
00:20:47.245 --> 00:20:50.248
and choose, after his mother
say to Radu,

311
00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:54.210
"Radu, you put the goat
back in the goat house,

312
00:20:54.502 --> 00:20:58.631
or you is cleaning
the dirty hole of the father?"

313
00:20:58.923 --> 00:21:01.091
Dude, why do we invite him?

314
00:21:01.384 --> 00:21:03.386
Come on, he's funny.

315
00:21:03.678 --> 00:21:04.804
True.

316
00:21:06.181 --> 00:21:07.307
Shrooms.

317
00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:07.974
Sweets?

318
00:21:08.266 --> 00:21:11.477
- Somethin' like that.
- Here.

319
00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:16.065
Oh, ha, ha, ba, boy.

320
00:21:21.946 --> 00:21:22.488
What was that?

321
00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:25.533
Do not be afraid,
is only badger.

322
00:21:25.825 --> 00:21:27.743
Radu will fight.

323
00:21:33.208 --> 00:21:34.876
Is no badger!

324
00:21:38.671 --> 00:21:39.463
Oh!

325
00:21:39.756 --> 00:21:42.258
Oh, do you need the bandages?

326
00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.843
Holy shit!

327
00:21:49.307 --> 00:21:51.100
Running!

328
00:22:05.406 --> 00:22:07.491
Hey, Maddy, come on in,
door's open.

329
00:22:07.784 --> 00:22:08.284
Hey, Phil.

330
00:22:08.576 --> 00:22:11.704
Uh, hey, uh,
I'll fix the door tomorrow.

331
00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:16.000
Whoa.

332
00:22:16.292 --> 00:22:18.544
Did you build all these?

333
00:22:18.837 --> 00:22:19.921
Yes, I did.

334
00:22:26.678 --> 00:22:28.346
Oops.

335
00:22:33.309 --> 00:22:34.226
Whatcha workin' on?

336
00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:36.562
Same old stuff.

337
00:22:38.606 --> 00:22:40.691
Can I see?

338
00:22:41.693 --> 00:22:43.945
Problem with my last iteration
was that I neglected

339
00:22:44.237 --> 00:22:46.072
to take into account
the increase

340
00:22:46.364 --> 00:22:46.697
in power consumption

341
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.075
when I changed out
the radio carbine undulators

342
00:22:49.367 --> 00:22:51.744
with the new Konoko
brand lux-pistons

343
00:22:52.036 --> 00:22:54.204
that I got
from that Korean website.

344
00:22:54.497 --> 00:22:57.458
But, I got this.

345
00:22:58.418 --> 00:23:00.253
A fancy D battery.

346
00:23:00.545 --> 00:23:01.003
Hey, whoa!

347
00:23:01.296 --> 00:23:04.674
That's like comparing
a firework to an atom bomb.

348
00:23:04.966 --> 00:23:08.511
Now this is
the Amorium Clustergram.

349
00:23:08.803 --> 00:23:09.011
Oh.

350
00:23:09.304 --> 00:23:10.888
Piece of tech way ahead
of its time.

351
00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.641
This thing can rapidly
convert joules of energy

352
00:23:14.934 --> 00:23:17.686
into bit-fueled streams
of particles—

353
00:23:17.979 --> 00:23:19.814
Phil, you know,
I don't speak nerd.

354
00:23:20.106 --> 00:23:21.273
English, please.

355
00:23:24.027 --> 00:23:24.277
Careful.

356
00:23:24.569 --> 00:23:26.821
- Grab the legs.
- Okay.

357
00:23:27.113 --> 00:23:28.364
Okay, yeah.

358
00:23:28.656 --> 00:23:30.574
Put that down.

359
00:23:30.867 --> 00:23:31.617
Nice and tight.

360
00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:32.368
No, nice and tight.

361
00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.412
Hunter, that's not my leg.

362
00:23:35.705 --> 00:23:38.332
Oh, sorry.

363
00:23:38.625 --> 00:23:38.916
Now what?

364
00:23:39.208 --> 00:23:42.294
Uh, will you pass me
the Amorium Clustergram?

365
00:23:44.297 --> 00:23:46.549
The shiny doodad.

366
00:23:46.841 --> 00:23:49.385
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

367
00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:53.472
Okay.

368
00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:55.808
You know the hole in the door?

369
00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:56.600
Yeah.

370
00:23:56.893 --> 00:23:59.604
- Yeah, I would take a step back.
- Oh, Phil.

371
00:23:59.896 --> 00:24:01.105
This shit is for real.

372
00:24:01.397 --> 00:24:02.189
Phil, you know,
maybe we should—

373
00:24:02.482 --> 00:24:03.024
Okay, lefty loosey.

374
00:24:03.316 --> 00:24:04.859
Seriously, Phil,
just stop, okay?

375
00:24:05.151 --> 00:24:05.860
And right.

376
00:24:06.152 --> 00:24:07.278
Oh, God, Phil!

377
00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:10.114
- Are you okay, Phil?
- I'm good.

378
00:24:10.406 --> 00:24:11.198
- Here, let me—
- Good.

379
00:24:11.491 --> 00:24:12.658
- Here, here.
- No, don't.

380
00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:13.368
Okay, okay.

381
00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.620
I need to do it myself.

382
00:24:17.622 --> 00:24:18.956
- Okay.
- Here, just give me your hand.

383
00:24:19.248 --> 00:24:20.874
- No!
- Just—

384
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:28.299
Oh, my God.

385
00:24:28.591 --> 00:24:29.883
- Phil!
- It's working.

386
00:24:30.176 --> 00:24:31.010
I can't believe it.

387
00:24:31.302 --> 00:24:33.012
Easy, easy, okay, okay,
baby steps.

388
00:24:33.304 --> 00:24:33.804
- Baby steps.
- I'm walking.

389
00:24:34.097 --> 00:24:35.640
Calm down, baby steps.

390
00:24:35.932 --> 00:24:37.725
I'm walking.

391
00:24:38.017 --> 00:24:39.935
Oh! No!

392
00:24:40.228 --> 00:24:41.145
Shit, Phil!

393
00:24:41.437 --> 00:24:42.938
S— stop.

394
00:24:43.231 --> 00:24:43.898
- Fuck!
- Stop!

395
00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.108
Calm down, calm down.
You're fine. It's okay. Okay.

396
00:24:46.401 --> 00:24:47.985
Alright, fine, I'm sorry.

397
00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:54.321
Hey, come on, at least
you didn't blow your leg off!

398
00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:56.077
Phil, come back.

399
00:24:56.369 --> 00:24:57.620
Philip!

400
00:25:01.374 --> 00:25:02.333
Philip!

401
00:25:02.625 --> 00:25:05.252
- Where is he going?
- I don't know.

402
00:25:05.545 --> 00:25:06.712
Okay, I'll be right back.

403
00:25:07.005 --> 00:25:07.672
We'll be here.

404
00:25:07.964 --> 00:25:09.632
Phil!
Hey, Phil, wait up!

405
00:25:10.591 --> 00:25:13.885
Deputy. Everything
under control?

406
00:25:14.178 --> 00:25:15.179
Obviously.

407
00:25:15.471 --> 00:25:16.472
Sorry, if this was a bad time.

408
00:25:16.764 --> 00:25:18.724
She told me that she borrowed
his English notebook,

409
00:25:19.017 --> 00:25:19.559
or something.

410
00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:22.270
Yeah, I think it was an excuse
just to come by.

411
00:25:22.562 --> 00:25:25.356
Ah, hormones and all of that.

412
00:25:25.648 --> 00:25:28.025
Yeah.

413
00:25:34.282 --> 00:25:35.866
They might be gone a while.

414
00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:39.996
I just, um, if y—
if you wanna come inside.

415
00:25:44.584 --> 00:25:45.876
Uh, why not?

416
00:25:46.169 --> 00:25:47.086
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

417
00:25:47.378 --> 00:25:48.295
Oh, okay.

418
00:25:51.215 --> 00:25:52.633
Uh, watch your step.

419
00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.223
- Make yourself at home.
-Mm.

420
00:26:02.769 --> 00:26:04.103
Do you want a beer?

421
00:26:04.395 --> 00:26:06.939
I am fine with this if you are?

422
00:26:08.858 --> 00:26:10.860
Um, yes.

423
00:26:11.152 --> 00:26:12.778
Very much so.

424
00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.281
Oh, this is wild.

425
00:26:15.573 --> 00:26:17.741
What is?

426
00:26:18.159 --> 00:26:20.119
I just never thought
I would be getting high

427
00:26:20.411 --> 00:26:22.121
with one of my old teachers.

428
00:26:24.123 --> 00:26:24.873
Old?

429
00:26:25.166 --> 00:26:26.792
No, I did—
I didn't mean it like that.

430
00:26:27.085 --> 00:26:27.460
I just mean like...

431
00:26:27.752 --> 00:26:30.671
Well, I never thought
you'd end up being a cop.

432
00:26:31.798 --> 00:26:34.008
What's that supposed to mean?

433
00:26:34.842 --> 00:26:39.342
Nothing. I just— you always
seemed a bit too open-minded.

434
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:43.683
At least,
to get stuck around here.

435
00:26:44.185 --> 00:26:45.936
I'm not stuck.

436
00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:48.981
Everyone still here is stuck.

437
00:26:51.359 --> 00:26:54.278
I'm guessing these are yours.

438
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.613
Uh, no.

439
00:26:56.906 --> 00:26:58.991
Those are my dad's.

440
00:26:59.283 --> 00:27:00.075
Phil's read 'em all, though,

441
00:27:00.368 --> 00:27:03.037
so they might as well be
his now.

442
00:27:03.329 --> 00:27:04.371
"The Molecular Response

443
00:27:04.664 --> 00:27:06.415
to Non-Dimensional
Tubular Optics

444
00:27:06.707 --> 00:27:09.710
and their Effect
on Postmodern Orbital Theories".

445
00:27:10.002 --> 00:27:11.962
I knew he was smart, but damn!

446
00:27:14.173 --> 00:27:15.757
Is this...

447
00:27:16.342 --> 00:27:17.760
Oh, let's— let's not.
Let's not!

448
00:27:18.052 --> 00:27:18.510
Yes, let's do!

449
00:27:18.803 --> 00:27:21.806
This is from the year
you graduated, right?

450
00:27:22.098 --> 00:27:22.723
Oh, my God!

451
00:27:23.015 --> 00:27:24.016
I remember how pissed they were.

452
00:27:24.308 --> 00:27:25.851
- It's gotta be in here.
- Uh, I really hope it's not.

453
00:27:26.894 --> 00:27:27.895
It has to be in here somewhere.

454
00:27:28.187 --> 00:27:29.605
- Here.
- Oh.

455
00:27:29.897 --> 00:27:33.191
Oh, my God!

456
00:27:34.318 --> 00:27:36.028
It's better than I remembered.

457
00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.323
Does young and stupid count
as a good excuse?

458
00:27:41.075 --> 00:27:42.618
If you'll ignore
my nerd glasses.

459
00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:44.870
Oh, yeah, um, I don't think
that's this year.

460
00:27:45.163 --> 00:27:47.456
No, that's—

461
00:27:47.748 --> 00:27:48.373
Aw.

462
00:27:50.293 --> 00:27:53.587
Did someone have a little crush
on teacher?

463
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.213
Whatever.

464
00:27:54.505 --> 00:27:58.842
Bobby Lutz drew that,
so like whatever.

465
00:27:59.135 --> 00:28:00.970
Liar.

466
00:28:08.978 --> 00:28:11.981
Well, uh,
I don't want my daughter

467
00:28:12.273 --> 00:28:16.773
to smell the weed on me,
so let's, uh, go for a walk.

468
00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:19.196
Yes.

469
00:28:23.034 --> 00:28:25.661
Um, yeah, okay.

470
00:28:28.581 --> 00:28:31.709
Dude, wait up!

471
00:28:32.001 --> 00:28:32.918
Fuck!

472
00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:34.503
Let it out.

473
00:28:36.297 --> 00:28:38.590
Fuck!

474
00:28:38.883 --> 00:28:40.718
Cock!

475
00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:43.929
Sorry, I'm just
in a really shitty mood.

476
00:28:44.222 --> 00:28:45.348
Wait, really?

477
00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.974
I couldn't tell.

478
00:28:47.725 --> 00:28:49.268
Shut up.

479
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.395
Do you want me
to leave you alone?

480
00:28:51.687 --> 00:28:52.979
No, I'm okay.

481
00:28:53.272 --> 00:28:56.316
Do you wanna go watch
homeless people have sex

482
00:28:56.609 --> 00:28:58.360
on the beach?

483
00:28:58.653 --> 00:28:59.820
I guess.

484
00:29:00.112 --> 00:29:00.654
All right.

485
00:29:00.947 --> 00:29:02.782
Then come on, Debbie Downer.

486
00:29:13.459 --> 00:29:13.917
Half friends is

487
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:15.961
food for the ocean demon.

488
00:29:16.254 --> 00:29:17.088
What the fuck did he just say?

489
00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.632
Is concubine ears stuffed
with cabbage?

490
00:29:19.924 --> 00:29:21.759
I says American children
is yum yum

491
00:29:22.051 --> 00:29:24.178
for the...

492
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.803
Are you all right?

493
00:29:25.096 --> 00:29:28.432
Please, I is needing of alcohol.

494
00:29:28.724 --> 00:29:30.058
How old are you?

495
00:29:30.351 --> 00:29:30.851
Radu?

496
00:29:31.143 --> 00:29:33.937
No, Radu is 20
and 1 years of age.

497
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:36.565
Legal drinking
for the United States of Ame—

498
00:29:36.857 --> 00:29:38.608
I smell a liar.

499
00:29:38.901 --> 00:29:42.279
I smell yous dirty poop hole!

500
00:29:42.571 --> 00:29:43.363
Bullshit!

501
00:29:43.656 --> 00:29:47.409
Get the hell out of my bar
before I call the sheriff!

502
00:29:47.702 --> 00:29:50.496
Yes, yes,
call the law enforcement,

503
00:29:50.788 --> 00:29:51.205
please, yes!

504
00:29:51.539 --> 00:29:54.792
Man, don't make me get up
and kick your ass.

505
00:29:55.084 --> 00:29:56.168
Yeah, okay, okay.

506
00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:57.294
You need to leave.

507
00:29:57.586 --> 00:29:58.878
All right, be it so!

508
00:29:59.171 --> 00:30:00.297
But if Radu die tonight,

509
00:30:00.589 --> 00:30:04.259
the blood of Radu
is on your wet hands!

510
00:30:04.552 --> 00:30:06.011
Wet Radu blood!

511
00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:09.098
- Get out!
- Get the fuck out of here!

512
00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:11.475
Boy, we get all kinds, huh.

513
00:30:17.064 --> 00:30:17.481
Curse you!

514
00:30:17.773 --> 00:30:19.691
Curse you
and your many children!

515
00:30:23.404 --> 00:30:24.613
What was that?

516
00:30:31.412 --> 00:30:33.580
Have you tried adding
a defibrillating layer

517
00:30:33.873 --> 00:30:34.582
to the inner knee-shock module?

518
00:30:34.874 --> 00:30:36.292
The legs keeping
breaking around

519
00:30:36.584 --> 00:30:37.167
the inception point anchor.

520
00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:38.419
I don't think adding a defibri—

521
00:30:38.711 --> 00:30:39.002
Exactly!

522
00:30:39.337 --> 00:30:40.588
The defib will help control
the force output

523
00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.090
and stop the clustergram
from overloading.

524
00:30:43.382 --> 00:30:44.424
Would that really work?

525
00:30:44.717 --> 00:30:46.635
Yeah, a genius, remember?

526
00:30:48.304 --> 00:30:51.015
Fuck, thank God,
you Jesus fuckers!

527
00:30:51.307 --> 00:30:52.599
We is needing to be running.

528
00:30:52.892 --> 00:30:55.019
Radu is fresh from attack.

529
00:30:55.311 --> 00:30:58.147
Listen to Radu
and do this shit, okay?

530
00:30:58.439 --> 00:31:00.274
'Cause we all about
to go poof town.

531
00:31:00.566 --> 00:31:00.941
Wait, what?

532
00:31:01.233 --> 00:31:04.611
Call number
for American Imperial Forces.

533
00:31:04.904 --> 00:31:05.696
Who is attacking you?

534
00:31:05.988 --> 00:31:06.947
Piss off, Radu.

535
00:31:07.239 --> 00:31:08.823
Don't encourage him.

536
00:31:09.408 --> 00:31:12.494
Shut your dirty chair face!

537
00:31:12.787 --> 00:31:14.580
I am trying to help you
right now!

538
00:31:14.872 --> 00:31:19.209
I run to you, I give you tip,
and you tell me to piss off.

539
00:31:19.502 --> 00:31:21.504
Why people say to piss
off to Radu?

540
00:31:21.796 --> 00:31:26.296
I warn about the ocean demon,
and no, "Just piss off, Radu!"

541
00:31:28.677 --> 00:31:31.054
Radu is sick of America!

542
00:31:32.431 --> 00:31:34.433
Radu.

543
00:31:34.725 --> 00:31:36.476
We are going to die.

544
00:31:36.936 --> 00:31:38.896
It's kinda cute.

545
00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.566
Monster that eat skin is cute?

546
00:31:42.858 --> 00:31:45.068
Hey, Maddy, please be careful.

547
00:31:45.361 --> 00:31:47.654
Guys, come check this out.

548
00:31:49.448 --> 00:31:52.075
I can taste clouds.

549
00:31:55.871 --> 00:31:58.582
Hey there, little guy.

550
00:31:58.874 --> 00:32:00.667
What exactly are you?

551
00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.796
Oh, your face about
to go bye-bye.

552
00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.132
Oh, poor thing's injured.

553
00:32:07.425 --> 00:32:08.801
Kill it with the fire.

554
00:32:09.093 --> 00:32:09.927
Kill it!

555
00:32:10.219 --> 00:32:12.221
You guys are scaring it.

556
00:32:12.513 --> 00:32:14.932
Fucking kill it!

557
00:32:15.224 --> 00:32:16.099
Don't be afraid.

558
00:32:22.565 --> 00:32:23.899
Game over.

559
00:32:24.191 --> 00:32:26.359
Radu!

560
00:32:28.404 --> 00:32:30.656
I'm not gonna hurt you.

561
00:32:30.948 --> 00:32:31.823
There you go.

562
00:32:34.535 --> 00:32:36.995
Come on.

563
00:32:37.288 --> 00:32:38.580
Come on.

564
00:32:51.218 --> 00:32:54.429
Madeline is slaughterer
of demons!

565
00:32:54.722 --> 00:32:56.098
She has the magic touch.

566
00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:58.141
When the shit is truly
hitting the fan,

567
00:32:58.434 --> 00:33:02.354
Radu is putting his last 
on the girl.

568
00:33:03.731 --> 00:33:06.150
What the hell did I just see?

569
00:33:09.737 --> 00:33:12.156
Radu, you should go home.

570
00:33:12.448 --> 00:33:14.491
Hope you find your friends.

571
00:33:18.621 --> 00:33:20.581
Okay, bye.

572
00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:32.551
Wait, you want me
to help chaperone the dance?

573
00:33:32.843 --> 00:33:33.343
Seriously?

574
00:33:33.636 --> 00:33:36.388
Come on, it'll be really fun.

575
00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.806
Let me check my calendar.

576
00:33:38.098 --> 00:33:39.766
You don't have a calendar.

577
00:33:40.059 --> 00:33:41.226
Hmm.

578
00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:42.311
We'll see.

579
00:33:42.603 --> 00:33:45.147
I think I can move some things
around and squeeze you in.

580
00:33:45.439 --> 00:33:46.398
Hmm. Oh, really.

581
00:33:48.108 --> 00:33:48.817
- Uh-oh.
- Oh.

582
00:33:49.109 --> 00:33:50.276
Hmm.

583
00:33:50.569 --> 00:33:51.653
Hi, Sweetie Cakes.

584
00:33:51.946 --> 00:33:55.074
Oh, Philip, are you excited
about the dance?

585
00:33:55.366 --> 00:33:56.408
You already told your mom?

586
00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:58.702
Oh, don't read into it.

587
00:34:00.329 --> 00:34:01.496
Ready, Mom?

588
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:02.831
Sure, Sweetie Cake.

589
00:34:03.123 --> 00:34:04.374
Got lots of papers to grade.

590
00:34:04.667 --> 00:34:06.335
Goodnight, Maddy.

591
00:34:06.627 --> 00:34:07.753
Goodnight.

592
00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.798
Goodnight, Mrs. Menrath.

593
00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:12.382
It's Ms. Menrath.

594
00:34:12.675 --> 00:34:14.093
Mom, ew!

595
00:34:20.683 --> 00:34:22.017
- Mom.
- Yeah.

596
00:34:22.309 --> 00:34:25.437
I need your help with something
really important.

597
00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:29.274
Why anything, my obnoxiously
cryptic daughter.

598
00:34:29.567 --> 00:34:31.485
You're freakin' me out a little.

599
00:34:31.777 --> 00:34:33.153
Okay.

600
00:34:33.445 --> 00:34:34.529
Come on.

601
00:34:37.241 --> 00:34:38.617
Mom, duck!

602
00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:40.243
Don't be dumb.

603
00:34:40.536 --> 00:34:41.662
Don't talk to your mother
like that.

604
00:34:41.954 --> 00:34:43.538
Don't hit your daughter
like that.

605
00:34:43.831 --> 00:34:45.123
Where are we going?

606
00:34:47.126 --> 00:34:48.544
- Are we playing a game?
- No.

607
00:34:48.836 --> 00:34:49.586
Too bad it's locked.

608
00:34:49.878 --> 00:34:52.755
Oh, is it now?

609
00:34:53.048 --> 00:34:55.592
Ye of little faith.

610
00:34:55.884 --> 00:34:56.718
Wait.

611
00:34:57.011 --> 00:34:59.346
Honey, where did you that key?

612
00:34:59.638 --> 00:35:01.598
I borrowed it.

613
00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:02.390
- Ugh.
- Come on.

614
00:35:02.683 --> 00:35:04.893
If I wasn't aggressively high
right now,

615
00:35:05.185 --> 00:35:05.560
you would be grounded.

616
00:35:05.853 --> 00:35:08.272
But is this a mini
nuclear reactor?

617
00:35:08.564 --> 00:35:10.274
- Mom, don't touch that!
- All right.

618
00:35:10.566 --> 00:35:12.401
Actually,
just don't touch anything.

619
00:35:12.693 --> 00:35:13.360
Is that even legal?

620
00:35:13.652 --> 00:35:15.445
Mom, we have work to do.

621
00:35:15.738 --> 00:35:19.074
These legs aren't gonna
build themselves.

622
00:35:21.619 --> 00:35:24.872
You are Poseidon's mistake.

623
00:35:25.164 --> 00:35:26.123
Did you know that?

624
00:35:26.415 --> 00:35:28.708
Poseidon,
he wake up every morning

625
00:35:29.001 --> 00:35:31.545
and he look at you
and say, "I fuck up".

626
00:35:31.837 --> 00:35:34.840
You not know that Radu is ninja.

627
00:35:36.508 --> 00:35:38.092
You are dead and I'm a ninja.

628
00:35:38.385 --> 00:35:41.596
You look like
my grandmother's neck.

629
00:35:41.889 --> 00:35:43.390
You kill my friends.

630
00:35:43.682 --> 00:35:44.516
Why'd you do that?

631
00:35:44.808 --> 00:35:47.435
You have more legs
than you need,

632
00:35:47.728 --> 00:35:48.812
you greedy piece of shit.

633
00:35:49.104 --> 00:35:51.231
Think you tough
'cause you have spine

634
00:35:51.523 --> 00:35:52.106
and you have tail?

635
00:35:52.399 --> 00:35:55.235
You know who else
have spine and tail?

636
00:35:55.527 --> 00:35:56.361
Bitches!

637
00:35:56.654 --> 00:35:57.321
Radu is warrior

638
00:35:57.613 --> 00:35:59.531
and he not afraid
of you no more!

639
00:35:59.823 --> 00:36:02.158
Gonna cut you up
into little pieces,

640
00:36:02.451 --> 00:36:05.328
then cook you, and make a stew,
and then throw it out,

641
00:36:05.621 --> 00:36:08.790
because orphans
don't want to eat you.

642
00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:13.583
Radu so high.

643
00:36:14.463 --> 00:36:15.046
Fuck you.

644
00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:19.384
Radu, fuck you.

645
00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:20.844
Uh.

646
00:36:21.136 --> 00:36:22.345
Huh?

647
00:36:23.806 --> 00:36:26.558
Oh, this not okay.

648
00:36:27.976 --> 00:36:31.354
What the fuck is that?

649
00:37:21.947 --> 00:37:23.114
It's a hit.

650
00:37:27.536 --> 00:37:28.662
Hey dude, you almost ready?

651
00:37:28.954 --> 00:37:30.205
Yeah, I'm gettin' there.

652
00:37:30.497 --> 00:37:31.372
Do you need any help?

653
00:37:31.665 --> 00:37:32.582
No, no, I got it.

654
00:37:32.875 --> 00:37:35.043
Here, let me help you.

655
00:37:35.335 --> 00:37:36.836
Okay.

656
00:37:37.129 --> 00:37:39.005
Oh.

657
00:37:40.549 --> 00:37:40.799
Oh!

658
00:37:41.091 --> 00:37:43.718
Uh, your lady friend left you
a little present outside.

659
00:37:44.011 --> 00:37:45.887
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

660
00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:47.723
I'll give you a hint.

661
00:37:48.724 --> 00:37:52.144
It's not a bag of dog poop.

662
00:37:53.353 --> 00:37:55.521
- Come on, that was funny.
- That was terrible.

663
00:37:55.814 --> 00:37:57.649
- That was funny.
- That was awful.

664
00:39:07.135 --> 00:39:10.805
Hey, you're gonna do great.

665
00:39:11.098 --> 00:39:12.307
Thanks, Hunter.

666
00:39:27.823 --> 00:39:30.575
Okay. Wish me luck, Broheimo?

667
00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:38.792
Here's a hint,
go find your date.

668
00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:04.860
Hey.

669
00:40:05.152 --> 00:40:08.196
- Hunter said your mom—
- Deserves partial credit.

670
00:40:08.488 --> 00:40:10.031
I'm the brains
behind the operation.

671
00:40:13.035 --> 00:40:14.619
Thank you, Maddy.

672
00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:20.291
You're tall.

673
00:40:22.336 --> 00:40:25.589
So what was that about
two left feet?

674
00:40:39.353 --> 00:40:41.563
No, not like that.

675
00:40:41.855 --> 00:40:42.689
Here.

676
00:40:42.981 --> 00:40:43.314
Try like this.

677
00:40:50.948 --> 00:40:53.575
Oh, sorry.

678
00:40:53.867 --> 00:40:54.701
For what?

679
00:40:54.993 --> 00:40:56.411
I stepped on your foot.

680
00:40:58.121 --> 00:40:59.038
So?

681
00:40:59.331 --> 00:41:00.040
I can't feel anything.

682
00:41:03.543 --> 00:41:05.878
I'm gonna like dancing with you.

683
00:41:21.478 --> 00:41:23.062
Oh, hello?

684
00:41:24.773 --> 00:41:25.648
Hello.

685
00:41:25.941 --> 00:41:27.692
Annalise?

686
00:41:34.032 --> 00:41:35.491
Annalise?

687
00:41:56.388 --> 00:41:57.680
Hello?

688
00:42:18.285 --> 00:42:19.160
Uh.

689
00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:23.623
Oh, whoa, whoa!
Okay, not cool.

690
00:42:23.915 --> 00:42:25.583
What the hell?

691
00:42:27.002 --> 00:42:28.169
Oh, fiddlesticks!

692
00:42:28.462 --> 00:42:28.920
- Hunter.
- Oh!

693
00:42:29.212 --> 00:42:30.713
- What—
- Hi, sorry.

694
00:42:31.006 --> 00:42:31.297
Um...

695
00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:33.008
Where you— did—
did you just follow me

696
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.092
to the bathroom?

697
00:42:34.384 --> 00:42:36.219
Yeah.

698
00:42:36.511 --> 00:42:38.137
You did?

699
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:40.306
What? No.

700
00:42:40.599 --> 00:42:42.058
I, um...

701
00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:44.143
- Sorry, did you see that thing?
- What thing?

702
00:42:44.436 --> 00:42:47.605
Like a— like a badger or—
or somethin'.

703
00:42:49.357 --> 00:42:50.775
A badger?

704
00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:53.153
Sorry, never mind, I—

705
00:42:54.529 --> 00:42:56.656
Hi, again.

706
00:42:56.948 --> 00:42:58.574
I, uh— uh, I saw you leave

707
00:42:58.867 --> 00:43:01.077
and I just wanted to come
and say...

708
00:43:01.369 --> 00:43:02.286
Nice pink shirt.

709
00:43:02.579 --> 00:43:04.455
Oh, God, you think it's stupid,
don't you?

710
00:43:04.748 --> 00:43:07.459
- Oh!
- No, I— it looks really...

711
00:43:07.751 --> 00:43:11.087
It's pink.
It— it's very pink.

712
00:43:11.379 --> 00:43:13.089
I— oh.

713
00:43:18.637 --> 00:43:19.846
Uh...

714
00:43:20.138 --> 00:43:22.473
Should we head back to the gym
and, uh—

715
00:43:23.975 --> 00:43:25.434
Chaperone?

716
00:43:28.647 --> 00:43:32.108
Yes, right.

717
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.818
Um—

718
00:43:34.111 --> 00:43:35.445
I, um...

719
00:43:37.989 --> 00:43:38.864
Where's the gym again?

720
00:43:40.742 --> 00:43:41.826
Come on.

721
00:43:47.666 --> 00:43:51.503
Oh, holy cow, he looks so happy!

722
00:43:51.795 --> 00:43:52.754
All right, come on.

723
00:43:53.046 --> 00:43:54.756
I can't let boy genius
show me up.

724
00:43:55.048 --> 00:43:56.090
Come on?

725
00:43:56.383 --> 00:43:56.758
Let's dance.

726
00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:02.722
- Let's go.
- Okay.

727
00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:26.866
- That's the thing I saw before.
- Hmm?

728
00:46:27.158 --> 00:46:28.826
In the hallway.

729
00:46:34.582 --> 00:46:35.416
Oh, my God!

730
00:46:35.709 --> 00:46:36.376
Shit!

731
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:47.220
Come on, everybody,
head for the door!

732
00:46:47.512 --> 00:46:49.305
Get back, get back!

733
00:46:49.597 --> 00:46:50.431
Get back, run!

734
00:46:50.724 --> 00:46:54.018
Get back!

735
00:46:54.311 --> 00:46:55.478
Get back, back!

736
00:46:56.855 --> 00:46:58.565
Maddy, look out.

737
00:47:07.741 --> 00:47:09.868
- You okay?
- Yeah.

738
00:47:13.121 --> 00:47:13.621
Whoa!

739
00:47:52.786 --> 00:47:54.162
Come on, move your asses!

740
00:47:54.454 --> 00:47:55.121
Hunter, look out!

741
00:48:03.254 --> 00:48:03.963
- Mom.
- Maddy.

742
00:48:04.255 --> 00:48:05.506
Phil, I'm glad you're all right.

743
00:48:05.799 --> 00:48:06.800
Hunter.

744
00:48:09.761 --> 00:48:12.013
Guys, did we do it?

745
00:48:12.305 --> 00:48:15.057
I can't believe Radu was right.

746
00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:16.768
I think they're dead.

747
00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:19.020
I think we did it.

748
00:48:19.312 --> 00:48:20.563
I think it's all over.

749
00:48:20.855 --> 00:48:22.106
They're all dead.

750
00:48:33.034 --> 00:48:35.578
What the fuck is that?

751
00:48:38.373 --> 00:48:39.624
Did it just molt?

752
00:48:40.708 --> 00:48:45.208
Oh, no, no, no,
what the fuck is that thing?

753
00:48:50.844 --> 00:48:52.554
Oh, oh, what the fuck!

754
00:48:54.097 --> 00:48:55.431
Go, go, go, go, go, run!

755
00:48:55.723 --> 00:48:57.808
Hunter, run!

756
00:48:59.185 --> 00:48:59.685
We gotta get out of here!

757
00:48:59.978 --> 00:49:01.729
Go! Go, go! Go, go, go!

758
00:49:09.988 --> 00:49:10.446
Come on, Phil, go!

759
00:49:10.738 --> 00:49:12.281
It's a bad time for those legs
to stop working Phil.

760
00:49:13.324 --> 00:49:15.534
Maddy, check the doors.

761
00:49:15.827 --> 00:49:17.203
The gears are locking up.

762
00:49:17.495 --> 00:49:17.870
It's locked!

763
00:49:18.163 --> 00:49:19.205
Let's go buddy,
we're almost there.

764
00:49:19.497 --> 00:49:20.039
They're malfunctioning!

765
00:49:20.331 --> 00:49:21.373
Keep checking.

766
00:49:21.666 --> 00:49:23.000
Hunter, they're locking up!

767
00:49:23.293 --> 00:49:24.210
I can't run.

768
00:49:28.423 --> 00:49:29.674
Phil! Let me help.

769
00:49:29.966 --> 00:49:31.217
I got him, I got him, go!

770
00:49:31.509 --> 00:49:32.426
- Guys, I found one!

771
00:49:32.719 --> 00:49:33.177
Damn fuckin' leg!

772
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:35.138
Phil, what kinda space mumbo
is this?

773
00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:36.848
Look out!

774
00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:38.933
- Shit!
- No, shit.

775
00:49:41.144 --> 00:49:41.686
Hunter, just go.

776
00:49:41.978 --> 00:49:44.438
It's okay.

777
00:49:44.731 --> 00:49:45.857
- Go now!
- Hunter!

778
00:49:46.149 --> 00:49:47.775
Dammit, get out of here!

779
00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:50.611
Don't be stupid, run!

780
00:49:50.904 --> 00:49:51.946
Get Phil.

781
00:49:52.238 --> 00:49:52.863
No.

782
00:49:53.156 --> 00:49:54.949
Hunter, no!

783
00:50:02.707 --> 00:50:06.836
Huh.

784
00:50:16.721 --> 00:50:18.264
Thanks for that.

785
00:50:23.645 --> 00:50:24.646
Thanks, Radu.

786
00:50:24.938 --> 00:50:25.897
Where'd you get a sword?

787
00:50:26.189 --> 00:50:28.566
Who no does have ninja sword?

788
00:50:30.693 --> 00:50:31.944
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Okay.

789
00:50:32.237 --> 00:50:32.737
Come on, let's go.

790
00:50:33.029 --> 00:50:34.363
Maddy, don't forget
the Clustergram.

791
00:50:34.656 --> 00:50:36.074
Two steps ahead of ya.

792
00:50:41.162 --> 00:50:42.997
Maddy, give me that chair
over there.

793
00:50:43.289 --> 00:50:43.831
Got it.

794
00:50:44.123 --> 00:50:44.915
- Here you go.
- Oh, I is—

795
00:50:45.208 --> 00:50:45.583
Thank you.

796
00:50:45.875 --> 00:50:47.543
So glad you are not dead
with the others.

797
00:50:48.586 --> 00:50:49.461
Radu, what the hell is going on?

798
00:50:49.754 --> 00:50:50.171
Ears to Radu!

799
00:50:50.463 --> 00:50:54.758
He has been on front lines
fighting war motherfuck

800
00:50:55.051 --> 00:50:56.302
on ocean demons!

801
00:50:56.594 --> 00:50:56.927
What are these things?

802
00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:00.014
My guess, some unknown species
of Limulidae.

803
00:51:00.306 --> 00:51:02.099
What's a Limula— like what?

804
00:51:02.392 --> 00:51:03.726
Look, they're called
"Horseshoe Crabs"

805
00:51:04.018 --> 00:51:04.518
and they've been totally
harmless

806
00:51:04.811 --> 00:51:08.815
for the last 450 million years,
until today apparently.

807
00:51:09.107 --> 00:51:09.524
All right, I'm no expert,

808
00:51:09.816 --> 00:51:11.025
but I've never seen
a six-foot tall crab.

809
00:51:11.317 --> 00:51:14.153
These are more closely related
to spiders or scorpions,

810
00:51:14.445 --> 00:51:14.820
not crabs, so...

811
00:51:15.113 --> 00:51:17.323
Well, I seriously doubt
these things are closely related

812
00:51:17.615 --> 00:51:18.949
to jack or shit anymore.

813
00:51:19.242 --> 00:51:20.826
Can we just move on?

814
00:51:21.119 --> 00:51:22.954
Oh, Radu have attempt to escape,

815
00:51:23.246 --> 00:51:26.123
but bridge to rest of America
is poof. No more.

816
00:51:26.416 --> 00:51:27.625
Ms. Menrath, somethings wrong,

817
00:51:27.917 --> 00:51:28.834
this thing is really hot.

818
00:51:29.127 --> 00:51:31.587
Yes, it keep Radu nice
and toasty.

819
00:51:31.879 --> 00:51:33.213
But arthropods are cold-blooded.

820
00:51:33.506 --> 00:51:35.799
Exactly, and that's just
the exoskeleton.

821
00:51:36.092 --> 00:51:36.592
Of course.

822
00:51:36.884 --> 00:51:38.719
Ms. Menrath, do you still
have my Geiger counter?

823
00:51:39.012 --> 00:51:39.679
I was thinking the same thing.

824
00:51:39.971 --> 00:51:41.973
Radu glad we is on same page.

825
00:51:42.265 --> 00:51:43.683
Phil, what's a Geiger counter?

826
00:51:43.975 --> 00:51:46.811
It detects and measures
the amount of radiation.

827
00:51:47.103 --> 00:51:49.480
It's just a hunch,
but it might tell us

828
00:51:49.772 --> 00:51:51.440
why this thing is hot.

829
00:51:55.778 --> 00:51:56.403
Oh!

830
00:51:56.696 --> 00:51:57.363
Ah, shit.

831
00:51:57.655 --> 00:51:58.822
I'm not gonna get cancer, am I?

832
00:51:59.115 --> 00:52:00.491
Well, I wouldn't touch it again.

833
00:52:00.783 --> 00:52:03.118
No, no, no, Radu no get cancer!

834
00:52:04.078 --> 00:52:08.578
Real talk, Radu now get cancer
to grow. Or transform?

835
00:52:09.292 --> 00:52:10.751
These measurements
are off the charts.

836
00:52:11.044 --> 00:52:12.503
What could have caused it
to be so irradiated?

837
00:52:12.795 --> 00:52:15.005
Uh, these things
wouldn't happen to have

838
00:52:15.298 --> 00:52:15.965
an uncle, would they?

839
00:52:16.257 --> 00:52:17.341
Like the size of jumbo jet?

840
00:52:17.634 --> 00:52:19.302
What do you mean, Hunter?

841
00:52:19.761 --> 00:52:21.554
Flannigan and I
found a beached whale yesterday,

842
00:52:21.846 --> 00:52:25.266
and it had a bite taken
out of it that was huge.

843
00:52:25.558 --> 00:52:26.392
Can you show us?

844
00:52:26.684 --> 00:52:27.893
Uh, yes.

845
00:52:28.186 --> 00:52:29.353
Um...

846
00:52:33.733 --> 00:52:35.359
Looks like
we have three different types.

847
00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:37.028
First, you've got
the little bastards

848
00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:37.987
that fucked up prom.

849
00:52:38.279 --> 00:52:41.991
And then, uh,
this one right here

850
00:52:42.283 --> 00:52:43.867
just chased us down the hallway.

851
00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.620
And then there's the one
that eats whales.

852
00:52:48.498 --> 00:52:49.957
Somethin' like that.

853
00:52:50.249 --> 00:52:52.000
Oh, the fuck no.

854
00:52:52.293 --> 00:52:53.002
Radu is out!

855
00:52:53.294 --> 00:52:54.253
We need to call the army.

856
00:52:54.587 --> 00:52:55.087
And tell them what?

857
00:52:55.463 --> 00:52:57.506
That we're being attacked
by man-eating crabs?

858
00:52:57.799 --> 00:53:00.968
Oh, and by the way,
there's some giant sea monster

859
00:53:01.302 --> 00:53:01.802
out there as well.

860
00:53:02.178 --> 00:53:04.346
Yes, perfect plan.

861
00:53:05.556 --> 00:53:08.976
No, they is not believing,
are they?

862
00:53:09.268 --> 00:53:11.937
No, Radu, they is not believing.

863
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:14.398
So what do we do?

864
00:53:22.323 --> 00:53:24.908
Hold on, Hunter,
bring me the projector.

865
00:53:26.994 --> 00:53:27.411
Thank you.

866
00:53:27.704 --> 00:53:30.665
Okay, uh,
you said these Limulid—

867
00:53:30.957 --> 00:53:32.667
the damn crabs are ancient,
right?

868
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:33.291
Right.

869
00:53:33.626 --> 00:53:34.460
Okay, let's just assume
that the radiation

870
00:53:34.752 --> 00:53:36.295
has caused them to evolve
for the first time

871
00:53:36.587 --> 00:53:40.007
in millions of years. That—
that they are forced to adapt

872
00:53:40.299 --> 00:53:42.426
to a new environment,
a radiated environment

873
00:53:42.719 --> 00:53:44.095
that would make them, uh—

874
00:53:44.387 --> 00:53:45.054
- Faster.
- Yes.

875
00:53:45.346 --> 00:53:45.929
- Stronger.
- Meaner.

876
00:53:46.222 --> 00:53:47.389
- Blue.
- No.

877
00:53:47.682 --> 00:53:47.932
Ugh.

878
00:53:48.266 --> 00:53:50.226
Wait, so these
perfectly-adapted animals

879
00:53:50.518 --> 00:53:53.521
are now supercharged
and attacking our town.

880
00:53:53.813 --> 00:53:54.104
Yes.

881
00:53:54.397 --> 00:53:57.775
And what can stop something
so jacked up?

882
00:53:58.067 --> 00:54:00.819
Another perfectly-evolved
predator.

883
00:54:01.112 --> 00:54:02.113
Yes.

884
00:54:02.405 --> 00:54:03.989
Supercharged.

885
00:54:04.282 --> 00:54:06.033
Oh, shit.

886
00:54:06.325 --> 00:54:08.035
- Everybody head to the window.
- Come on, Maddy.

887
00:54:08.327 --> 00:54:09.453
- Come on!
- Radu, let's go!

888
00:54:55.875 --> 00:54:59.169
Oh, this is not good.

889
00:54:59.462 --> 00:55:01.755
Mr. Norbert?

890
00:55:02.048 --> 00:55:04.300
Being controlled like marionettes.

891
00:55:04.592 --> 00:55:05.759
What the fuck!

892
00:55:06.052 --> 00:55:07.178
Oh, there is Dave!

893
00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:07.970
Dave, run!

894
00:55:08.262 --> 00:55:11.682
Oh, he is going to be
the deadest.

895
00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:15.185
Ahh, the face!

896
00:55:15.478 --> 00:55:16.812
Oh, that's so gross.

897
00:55:17.104 --> 00:55:18.647
Get us out of here, Hunter.

898
00:55:21.108 --> 00:55:22.609
Oh! Oh, barf!

899
00:55:22.902 --> 00:55:24.028
We can't let this happen.

900
00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:25.404
We have to stop it.

901
00:55:26.906 --> 00:55:28.490
Oh, they see us!

902
00:55:28.783 --> 00:55:33.162
Go back to it, go ba—
oh, yes, better.

903
00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:34.538
Jesus Christ, thank you!

904
00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:35.748
- Pastor Beckett!
- I have to get out of here!

905
00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:39.209
Thank God, Jesus Christ,
and all the saints,

906
00:55:39.502 --> 00:55:40.169
and all the martyrs
that ever lived!

907
00:55:40.461 --> 00:55:41.503
Pastor Beckett, look out!

908
00:55:41.796 --> 00:55:42.505
- Behind you!
- If I get out of this—

909
00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:46.174
Drive, Hunter. Drive.

910
00:55:49.762 --> 00:55:52.181
And then I pulled
the sword out of a tree stump

911
00:55:52.473 --> 00:55:55.100
and the birdie birds say,
"You are the king!"

912
00:55:55.393 --> 00:55:56.644
Radu, shh,
we're trying to listen.

913
00:55:56.936 --> 00:55:59.146
Crab monsters
ravishing major cities.

914
00:56:00.731 --> 00:56:01.648
Reports
are coming in from fishermen

915
00:56:01.941 --> 00:56:02.733
- all along the coast of—
- Stay in the car.

916
00:56:03.025 --> 00:56:03.859
Enormous ocean-liner-sized"

917
00:56:04.151 --> 00:56:04.985
- Phil.
- Creatures headed our way.

918
00:56:05.278 --> 00:56:06.153
Does this crazy plan
even stand a chance?

919
00:56:06.445 --> 00:56:07.404
What do these
giant monsters want?

920
00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:08.322
It'll work
if we build it together.

921
00:56:08.614 --> 00:56:09.406
Where are they coming from?

922
00:56:09.699 --> 00:56:10.908
- Trust me.
- And can we stop them?

923
00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:11.491
Okay.

924
00:56:11.784 --> 00:56:12.534
- These are the questions—
- I trust you.

925
00:56:12.827 --> 00:56:13.744
We're still asking ourselves

926
00:56:14.036 --> 00:56:15.746
here at WFQK News.

927
00:56:16.038 --> 00:56:17.372
Next up,
Carol with the weather.

928
00:56:17.665 --> 00:56:18.415
Uh, thanks Jim.

929
00:56:18.708 --> 00:56:19.375
Come on, come on,
we have a lotto do

930
00:56:19.667 --> 00:56:20.042
and not a lot of time.

931
00:56:20.334 --> 00:56:21.835
It's fucking raining crabs.

932
00:56:22.128 --> 00:56:23.587
Why are we still here?

933
00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:41.146
Here's your chair, Phil.

934
00:56:41.439 --> 00:56:42.690
Thanks.

935
00:56:52.742 --> 00:56:54.118
Where are you going?

936
00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:55.619
I need to go check
on the sheriff.

937
00:56:55.912 --> 00:56:59.415
But Hunter,
I— I need your help.

938
00:57:05.838 --> 00:57:07.256
No.

939
00:57:08.716 --> 00:57:10.175
You don't.

940
00:57:19.727 --> 00:57:21.311
Come on.

941
00:57:21.604 --> 00:57:23.606
He'll be okay.

942
00:57:23.898 --> 00:57:25.399
Let's get inside.

943
00:57:28.444 --> 00:57:30.154
Yeah.

944
00:57:30.446 --> 00:57:31.947
Let's do this.

945
00:57:36.953 --> 00:57:38.788
Radu cannot see.

946
00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:40.581
Where is Radu?

947
00:57:42.792 --> 00:57:45.795
- Phil, this place is amazing.
- Radu give thanks.

948
00:57:46.087 --> 00:57:46.962
Yeah.

949
00:57:47.254 --> 00:57:48.338
Thanks, Dad.

950
00:57:50.299 --> 00:57:51.425
Okay.

951
00:57:52.802 --> 00:57:57.302
Here's what we gotta do.

952
00:57:58.975 --> 00:57:59.850
Oh, fuck.

953
00:58:11.696 --> 00:58:13.322
Pirate ship.

954
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:16.492
Radu, no!

955
00:58:16.784 --> 00:58:19.203
Put that down!

956
00:58:19.495 --> 00:58:20.704
Hell yes!

957
00:58:20.997 --> 00:58:23.332
Bang, bang.

958
00:58:23.624 --> 00:58:24.082
You are different.

959
00:58:26.919 --> 00:58:27.628
Right here.

960
00:58:29.463 --> 00:58:29.921
Uh, Philip.

961
00:58:30.214 --> 00:58:31.506
- Let me show you.
- Here, let's try—

962
00:58:31.799 --> 00:58:32.841
Would you mind
just keeping it there?

963
00:58:34.468 --> 00:58:36.052
Aren't you supposed
to be a genius?

964
00:58:40.683 --> 00:58:41.892
Satan made you.

965
00:58:44.103 --> 00:58:45.729
It's okay, I gotcha.

966
00:58:46.022 --> 00:58:47.481
Whoa, uh-oh, no!

967
00:58:47.773 --> 00:58:48.315
It'll come right off.

968
00:58:48.607 --> 00:58:49.399
Okay, yeah, unlike your legs,

969
00:58:49.692 --> 00:58:52.820
my hands have feeling in them,
so...

970
00:58:53.112 --> 00:58:54.738
I have feelings.

971
00:58:56.574 --> 00:58:57.825
Faucet head!

972
00:58:58.951 --> 00:58:59.868
Speedometer!

973
00:59:00.161 --> 00:59:01.620
It's looking great.

974
00:59:03.706 --> 00:59:04.915
Mm-mm.

975
00:59:10.963 --> 00:59:12.756
Hmm.

976
00:59:13.049 --> 00:59:14.133
Oh.

977
00:59:14.425 --> 00:59:15.300
Success!

978
00:59:15.593 --> 00:59:16.594
Much better.

979
00:59:16.886 --> 00:59:18.012
Radu.

980
00:59:18.304 --> 00:59:19.138
Propeller blade.

981
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:20.681
Flotation device.

982
00:59:20.973 --> 00:59:22.766
- Knot.
- CB radio!

983
00:59:23.059 --> 00:59:23.809
Over and out.

984
00:59:24.101 --> 00:59:27.771
Saw. And stuff.

985
00:59:32.276 --> 00:59:34.528
- Amorium Clustergram!
- Amorium Clustergram!

986
01:00:27.248 --> 01:00:29.917
Hey, Flannigan,
you in here, Buddy?

987
01:00:39.844 --> 01:00:41.595
Shit.

988
01:00:49.228 --> 01:00:51.146
Sheriff?

989
01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:55.400
Oh, fuck.

990
01:01:20.718 --> 01:01:24.012
Fuck you, you little crab!

991
01:01:35.107 --> 01:01:36.024
Sheriff?

992
01:01:36.317 --> 01:01:38.110
Flannigan, is that you?

993
01:01:41.113 --> 01:01:44.241
Oh, no.

994
01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:47.285
Oh, fuck.

995
01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:53.876
Sorry, buddy.

996
01:01:59.173 --> 01:02:01.300
I'm sorry, Flannigan.

997
01:02:29.536 --> 01:02:31.162
Let's fuckin' do this.

998
01:02:35.042 --> 01:02:36.877
Oh, oh! Oh!

999
01:02:38.045 --> 01:02:39.296
I sorry, Ms. Menrath.

1000
01:02:39.588 --> 01:02:43.925
I— I give this to you as the—
the present, do you know?

1001
01:02:44.218 --> 01:02:44.885
Thank you.

1002
01:02:45.177 --> 01:02:46.219
Yes.

1003
01:02:46.512 --> 01:02:50.599
This for the price of marriage
for your daughter.

1004
01:02:50.891 --> 01:02:51.808
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. She—

1005
01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:52.518
It is done now.

1006
01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:54.895
No, she needs
more than a wrench.

1007
01:03:19.086 --> 01:03:21.379
Shitty balls!

1008
01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:25.384
What was that?

1009
01:03:25.676 --> 01:03:28.053
Big Bad Crab Monster.

1010
01:03:31.223 --> 01:03:34.434
Radu know his purpose!

1011
01:03:34.727 --> 01:03:38.814
Radu save females
and little robot boy from evil.

1012
01:03:39.106 --> 01:03:43.485
Radu won't be back,
most likely scenario.

1013
01:03:57.207 --> 01:04:00.043
Hey, bottom feeders!

1014
01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:02.046
Oh, the fuck no!

1015
01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:51.720
Smarty bitch!

1016
01:05:16.453 --> 01:05:18.413
It's everywhere.

1017
01:05:22.209 --> 01:05:23.335
Come on, we gotta get outside.

1018
01:05:23.627 --> 01:05:24.794
Where's Phil?

1019
01:05:25.087 --> 01:05:25.962
Just go!

1020
01:05:26.255 --> 01:05:27.714
Phil, hit it now!

1021
01:06:03.459 --> 01:06:05.252
What the fuck?

1022
01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:09.381
Phallus, Phallus!

1023
01:06:52.299 --> 01:06:54.050
Hey, Turd-licker.

1024
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:58.930
You just fucked
with the wrong handi-capable.

1025
01:07:28.001 --> 01:07:31.295
Oh, no, he beat you
like uncle beat dog.

1026
01:07:31.588 --> 01:07:35.341
Kick that crab bitch's ass!

1027
01:07:35.634 --> 01:07:38.011
Make him your friend
and then backstab him!

1028
01:07:38.303 --> 01:07:40.555
Make him your friend
and then backstab him!

1029
01:07:40.847 --> 01:07:43.891
- Oh!
- Backstab that bitch!

1030
01:07:46.478 --> 01:07:49.731
- Fucking do it, Phalup!
- Come on!

1031
01:07:50.983 --> 01:07:51.441
Philip!

1032
01:07:51.733 --> 01:07:52.859
Fuck!

1033
01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:55.821
Come on.

1034
01:07:58.532 --> 01:07:59.574
No.

1035
01:07:59.866 --> 01:08:00.783
Come on!

1036
01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:18.885
Come on, Philip.

1037
01:08:19.177 --> 01:08:20.720
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

1038
01:08:21.013 --> 01:08:22.055
Mom.

1039
01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:35.819
Phalup, Phalup,

1040
01:08:36.111 --> 01:08:38.988
suck the victory
out his shithole!

1041
01:08:40.157 --> 01:08:41.491
All right.

1042
01:08:41.783 --> 01:08:43.201
Really?

1043
01:08:44.161 --> 01:08:45.453
Fuck!

1044
01:08:48.165 --> 01:08:49.291
Okay.

1045
01:08:49.583 --> 01:08:51.751
All right, red to yellow.

1046
01:08:52.044 --> 01:08:53.837
Uh, which damn wire is it?

1047
01:08:54.129 --> 01:08:54.879
I gotta get this right.

1048
01:08:55.172 --> 01:08:58.800
I wish Maddy was here,
she'd know this.

1049
01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:01.303
Okay, I think this is it.

1050
01:09:03.805 --> 01:09:05.681
Got it!

1051
01:09:12.564 --> 01:09:16.317
Come on.

1052
01:09:23.325 --> 01:09:23.908
Yes.

1053
01:09:24.201 --> 01:09:25.160
Yeah, this is good step!

1054
01:09:25.452 --> 01:09:27.829
Yeah, that was awesome!

1055
01:09:29.623 --> 01:09:31.166
All right, come on.

1056
01:09:31.458 --> 01:09:33.501
Come on!

1057
01:09:34.628 --> 01:09:37.839
What?
Where did Phalup get a sword?

1058
01:09:40.008 --> 01:09:42.719
Who doesn't have a ninja sword?

1059
01:09:52.521 --> 01:09:54.397
She looks pissed.

1060
01:10:05.242 --> 01:10:07.077
That's not good.

1061
01:10:10.872 --> 01:10:12.748
So it's like that, huh?

1062
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:18.171
Okay, come on.

1063
01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:29.015
Let's play.

1064
01:10:38.817 --> 01:10:40.693
Friends!

1065
01:10:42.279 --> 01:10:44.364
Oh, fuck!

1066
01:10:50.537 --> 01:10:51.621
Fuck!

1067
01:10:54.124 --> 01:10:54.457
Phallus!

1068
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:57.085
Phallus, do it like this!

1069
01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:18.273
Fuck! Fuck.

1070
01:11:18.565 --> 01:11:22.819
No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

1071
01:11:30.035 --> 01:11:32.662
Oh!

1072
01:11:32.954 --> 01:11:33.829
- Philip!
- Oh, no, no, no.

1073
01:11:34.122 --> 01:11:35.248
- Mom.
- Be careful.

1074
01:12:07.906 --> 01:12:11.159
I got some drawn butter
in the trunk.

1075
01:12:11.868 --> 01:12:13.286
And I'm hungry.

1076
01:12:13.578 --> 01:12:14.203
Hunter.

1077
01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:16.372
Don't mess
with my little brother,

1078
01:12:16.665 --> 01:12:18.750
you ugly fuck!

1079
01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:24.297
Holy shit!

1080
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:27.216
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

1081
01:12:27.509 --> 01:12:28.801
Mm, mm, mm.

1082
01:12:41.231 --> 01:12:44.400
Oh, yes!

1083
01:12:46.403 --> 01:12:46.736
Come on.

1084
01:12:47.028 --> 01:12:47.653
- Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

1085
01:12:47.946 --> 01:12:48.488
- Yes!
- Yes!

1086
01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:50.239
Come on, punch him, Philip.

1087
01:12:50.532 --> 01:12:52.367
- Come on!
- Pun— punch in the taint.

1088
01:12:52.659 --> 01:12:54.494
Punch in the taint, Philip!

1089
01:12:54.786 --> 01:12:55.244
- Come on!
- Go ahead! In the...

1090
01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:56.704
- Yeah!
- Come on, Philip!

1091
01:12:58.498 --> 01:13:01.584
You know I'm getting
real tired of this shit.

1092
01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:06.172
Today was shaping up
to be the best day of my life.

1093
01:13:06.464 --> 01:13:08.841
Then your ugly ass showed up.

1094
01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:11.511
You're not gonna take that
away from me.

1095
01:13:11.803 --> 01:13:15.473
Not some wheelchair,
