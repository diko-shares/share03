[chuckling]

551
00:27:14.173 --> 00:27:15.757

Oh, let's— let's not.
Let's not!

Yes, let's do!

This is from the year

Oh, my God!

556
00:27:23.015 --> 00:27:24.016
I remember how pissed they were.

[Annalise]
It has to be in here somewhere.

560
00:27:28.187 --> 00:27:29.605

[chuckles]

563
00:27:34.318 --> 00:27:36.028
It's better than I remembered.

564
00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.323
Does young and stupid count

00:27:41.075 --> 00:27:42.618
If you'll ignore
my nerd glasses.

567

[Hunter chuckles]

571
00:27:50.293 --> 00:27:53.587
Did someone have a little crush
on teacher?

572
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.213
Whatever.

573
00:27:54.505 --> 00:27:58.842
Bobby Lutz drew that,
so like whatever.

574
00:27:59.135 --> 00:28:00.970

[chuckling]

576
00:28:08.978 --> 00:28:11.981
Well, uh,
I don't want my daughter

so let's, uh, go for a walk.

Fuck!

583

Let it out.

584

Shut up.

No, I'm okay.

592
00:28:53.272 --> 00:28:56.316
Do you wanna go watch
homeless people have sex

593
00:28:56.609 --> 00:28:58.360
on the beach?

594
00:28:58.653 --> 00:28:59.820
I guess.

595
00:29:00.112 --> 00:29:00.654
All right.

596
00:29:00.947 --> 00:29:02.782
Then come on, Debbie Downer.

597
00:29:04.325 --> 00:29:05.617

619
00:29:51.539 --> 00:29:54.792
Man, don't make me get up
and kick your ass.

620
00:29:55.084 --> 00:29:56.168
Yeah, okay, okay.

621
00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:57.294
You need to leave.

622
00:29:57.586 --> 00:29:58.878
All right, be it so!

623
00:29:59.171 --> 00:30:00.297
But if Radu die tonight,

624

the blood of Radu
is on your wet hands!

625
00:30:04.552 --> 00:30:06.011
Wet Radu blood!

627
00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:11.475
Boy, we get all kinds, huh.

628
00:30:12.393 --> 00:30:14.645
[grunting]

629
00:30:17.064 --> 00:30:17.481

[crab grunting]

635
00:30:31.412 --> 00:30:33.580
Have you tried adding
a defibrillating layer

636
00:30:33.873 --> 00:30:34.582
to the inner knee-shock module?

637
00:30:34.874 --> 00:30:36.292

breaking around

the inception point anchor.

639
00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:38.419
I don't think adding a defibri—

640
00:30:38.711 --> 00:30:39.002
Exactly!

641
00:30:39.337 --> 00:30:40.588
The defib will help control
the force output

642
00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.090
and stop the clustergram
from overloading.

643
00:30:43.382 --> 00:30:44.424
Would that really work?

644
00:30:44.717 --> 00:30:46.635
Yeah, a genius, remember?

645
00:30:46.927 --> 00:30:48.011

We is needing to be running.

648

Radu is fresh from attack.

649
00:30:55.311 --> 00:30:58.147
Listen to Radu
and do this shit, okay?

650
00:30:58.439 --> 00:31:00.274
'Cause we all about
to go poof town.

for American Imperial Forces.

653
00:31:04.904 --> 00:31:05.696
Who is attacking you?

654
00:31:05.988 --> 00:31:06.947
Piss off, Radu.

655
00:31:07.239 --> 00:31:08.823
Don't encourage him.

656
00:31:09.408 --> 00:31:12.494
Shut your dirty chair face!

657
00:31:12.787 --> 00:31:14.580
I am trying to help you
right now!

658
00:31:14.872 --> 00:31:19.209
I run to you, I give you tip,
and you tell me to piss off.

659
00:31:19.502 --> 00:31:21.504
Why people say to piss
off to Radu?

660
00:31:21.796 --> 00:31:26.296
I warn about the ocean demon,
and no, "Just piss off, Radu!"

661
00:31:27.218 --> 00:31:28.385
[Radu yelling]

662
00:31:28.677 --> 00:31:31.054
Radu is sick of America!

663
00:31:31.347 --> 00:31:32.139

664
00:31:32.431 --> 00:31:34.433
[crab] Radu.

665
00:31:34.725 --> 00:31:36.476
We are going to die.

666
00:31:36.936 --> 00:31:38.896
It's kinda cute.

Hey, Maddy, please be careful.

670
00:31:45.361 --> 00:31:47.654
Guys, come check this out.

[crab chirping]

674
00:31:55.871 --> 00:31:58.582
Hey there, little guy.

675
00:31:58.874 --> 00:32:00.667
What exactly are you?

676
00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.796

[Radu] Kill it with the fire.

680
00:32:09.093 --> 00:32:09.927
Kill it!

681
00:32:10.219 --> 00:32:12.221
You guys are scaring it.

682
00:32:12.513 --> 00:32:14.932
[Radu] Fucking kill it!

683
00:32:15.224 --> 00:32:16.099
Don't be afraid.

684
00:32:16.392 --> 00:32:19.603
[crab whimpering]

685
00:32:22.565 --> 00:32:23.899
Game over.

686
00:32:24.191 --> 00:32:26.359
- Radu!
- [grunting]

687
00:32:28.404 --> 00:32:30.656
I'm not gonna hurt you.

688
00:32:30.948 --> 00:32:31.823
There you go.

Madeline is slaughterer
of demons!

697
00:32:54.722 --> 00:32:56.098
She has the magic touch.

698
00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:58.141
When the shit is truly
hitting the fan,

699
00:32:58.434 --> 00:33:02.354
Radu is putting his last 
[speaking foreign language] on the girl.

700
00:33:02.646 --> 00:33:03.438
[laughs]

701
00:33:03.731 --> 00:33:06.150
What the hell did I just see?

702
00:33:06.442 --> 00:33:08.610
[chuckles]

703
00:33:09.737 --> 00:33:12.156
Radu, you should go home.

704

[Maddy]
Hope you find your friends.

705
00:33:18.621 --> 00:33:20.581
Okay, bye.

706
00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:24.417
[Spits]

707
00:33:26.587 --> 00:33:27.879
[both laughing]

708
00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:32.551
Wait, you want me
to help chaperone the dance?

709
00:33:32.843 --> 00:33:33.343
Seriously?

710
00:33:33.636 --> 00:33:36.388
Come on, it'll be really fun.

711
00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.806
Let me check my calendar.

712
00:33:38.098 --> 00:33:39.766
You don't have a calendar.

713
00:33:40.059 --> 00:33:41.226
Hmm.

714

Hmm. [clears throat]

Oh, Philip, are you excited
about the dance?

722

You already told your mom?

723

Oh, don't read into it.

00:50:55.051 --> 00:50:56.302
on ocean demons!

1094
00:50:56.594 --> 00:50:56.927
What are these things?

1095
00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:00.014
My guess, some unknown species
of Limulidae.

1096
00:51:00.306 --> 00:51:02.099
What's a Limula— like what?

1097
00:51:02.392 --> 00:51:03.726
Look, they're called
"Horseshoe Crabs"

1098
00:51:04.018 --> 00:51:04.518
and they've been totally
harmless

1099
00:51:04.811 --> 00:51:08.815
for the last 450 million years,
until today apparently.

1100
00:51:09.107 --> 00:51:09.524
All right, I'm no expert,

1101
00:51:09.816 --> 00:51:11.025
but I've never seen
a six-foot tall crab.

1102
00:51:11.317 --> 00:51:14.153
These are more closely related
to spiders or scorpions,

1103
00:51:14.445 --> 00:51:14.820
not crabs, so...

1104
00:51:15.113 --> 00:51:17.323
Well, I seriously doubt
these things are closely related

1105
00:51:17.615 --> 00:51:18.949
to jack or shit anymore.

1106
00:51:19.242 --> 00:51:20.826
Can we just move on?

1107
00:51:21.119 --> 00:51:22.954
Oh, Radu have attempt to escape,

1108
00:51:23.246 --> 00:51:26.123
but bridge to rest of America
is poof. No more.

1109
00:51:26.416 --> 00:51:27.625
Ms. Menrath, somethings wrong,

1110
00:51:27.917 --> 00:51:28.834
this thing is really hot.

1111
00:51:29.127 --> 00:51:31.587
Yes, it keep Radu nice
and toasty.

1112
00:51:31.879 --> 00:51:33.213
But arthropods are cold-blooded.

1113
00:51:33.506 --> 00:51:35.799
Exactly, and that's just
the exoskeleton.

1114
00:51:36.092 --> 00:51:36.592
[Radu] Of course.

1115
00:51:36.884 --> 00:51:38.719
Ms. Menrath, do you still
have my Geiger counter?

1116
00:51:39.012 --> 00:51:39.679
I was thinking the same thing.

1117
00:51:39.971 --> 00:51:41.973
Radu glad we is on same page.

1118
00:51:42.265 --> 00:51:43.683
Phil, what's a Geiger counter?

1119
00:51:43.975 --> 00:51:46.811
It detects and measures
the amount of radiation.

1120
00:51:47.103 --> 00:51:49.480
It's just a hunch,
but it might tell us

1121
00:51:49.772 --> 00:51:51.440
why this thing is hot.

1122
00:51:55.778 --> 00:51:56.403
[grunting] Oh!

1123
00:51:56.696 --> 00:51:57.363
[Hunter] Ah, shit.

1124
00:51:57.655 --> 00:51:58.822
I'm not gonna get cancer, am I?

1125
00:51:59.115 --> 00:52:00.491
Well, I wouldn't touch it again.

1126
00:52:00.783 --> 00:52:03.118
No, no, no, Radu no get cancer!

1127
00:52:03.411 --> 00:52:03.744
[spits]

1128
00:52:04.078 --> 00:52:08.578
Real talk, Radu now get cancer
to grow. Or transform?

1129
00:52:09.292 --> 00:52:10.751
[Philip] These measurements
are off the charts.

1130
00:52:11.044 --> 00:52:12.503
What could have caused it
to be so irradiated?

1131
00:52:12.795 --> 00:52:15.005
Uh, these things
wouldn't happen to have

1132
00:52:15.298 --> 00:52:15.965
an uncle, would they?

1133
00:52:16.257 --> 00:52:17.341
Like the size of jumbo jet?

1134
00:52:17.634 --> 00:52:19.302
What do you mean, Hunter?

1135
00:52:19.761 --> 00:52:21.554
Flannigan and I
found a beached whale yesterday,

1136
00:52:21.846 --> 00:52:25.266
and it had a bite taken
out of it that was huge.

1137
00:52:25.558 --> 00:52:26.392
Can you show us?

1138
00:52:26.684 --> 00:52:27.893
Uh, yes.

1139
00:52:28.186 --> 00:52:29.353
Um...

1140
00:52:33.733 --> 00:52:35.359
Looks like
we have three different types.

1141
00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:37.028
First, you've got
the little bastards

1142
00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:37.987
that fucked up prom.

1143
00:52:38.279 --> 00:52:41.991
And then, uh,
this one right here

1144
00:52:42.283 --> 00:52:43.867
just chased us down the hallway.

1145
00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.620
And then there's the one
that eats whales.

1146
00:52:48.498 --> 00:52:49.957
Somethin' like that.

1147
00:52:50.249 --> 00:52:52.000
Oh, the fuck no.

1148
00:52:52.293 --> 00:52:53.002
Radu is out!

1149
00:52:53.294 --> 00:52:54.253
We need to call the army.

1150
00:52:54.587 --> 00:52:55.087
And tell them what?

1151
00:52:55.463 --> 00:52:57.506
That we're being attacked
by man-eating crabs?

1152
00:52:57.799 --> 00:53:00.968
Oh, and by the way,
there's some giant sea monster

1153
00:53:01.302 --> 00:53:01.802
out there as well.

1154
00:53:02.178 --> 00:53:04.346
[chuckles] Yes, perfect plan.

1155
00:53:04.681 --> 00:53:05.223
[sighing]

1156
00:53:05.556 --> 00:53:08.976
No, they is not believing,
are they?

1157
00:53:09.268 --> 00:53:11.937
[Annalise]
No, Radu, they is not believing.

1158
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:14.398
So what do we do?

1159
00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:19.191
[♪♪♪]

1160
00:53:22.323 --> 00:53:24.908
Hold on, Hunter,
bring me the projector.

1161
00:53:26.994 --> 00:53:27.411
Thank you.

1162
00:53:27.704 --> 00:53:30.665
Okay, uh,
you said these Limulid—

1163
00:53:30.957 --> 00:53:32.667
the damn crabs are ancient,
right?

1164
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:33.291
Right.

1165
00:53:33.626 --> 00:53:34.460
Okay, let's just assume
that the radiation

1166
00:53:34.752 --> 00:53:36.295
has caused them to evolve
for the first time

1167
00:53:36.587 --> 00:53:40.007
in millions of years. That—
that they are forced to adapt

1168
00:53:40.299 --> 00:53:42.426
to a new environment,
a radiated environment

1169
00:53:42.719 --> 00:53:44.095
that would make them, uh—

1170
00:53:44.387 --> 00:53:45.054
- Faster.
- Yes.

1171
00:53:45.346 --> 00:53:45.929
- Stronger.
- Meaner.

1172
00:53:46.222 --> 00:53:47.389
- Blue.
- No.

1173
00:53:47.682 --> 00:53:47.932
Ugh.

1174
00:53:48.266 --> 00:53:50.226
Wait, so these
perfectly-adapted animals

1175
00:53:50.518 --> 00:53:53.521
are now supercharged
and attacking our town.

1176
00:53:53.813 --> 00:53:54.104
Yes.

1177
00:53:54.397 --> 00:53:57.775
And what can stop something
so jacked up?

1178
00:53:58.067 --> 00:54:00.819
Another perfectly-evolved
predator.

1179
00:54:01.112 --> 00:54:02.113
Yes.

1180
00:54:02.405 --> 00:54:03.989
Supercharged.

1181
00:54:04.282 --> 00:54:06.033
- [Limulus roaring in distance]
- Oh, shit.

1182
00:54:06.325 --> 00:54:08.035
- Everybody head to the window.
- Come on, Maddy.

1183
00:54:08.327 --> 00:54:09.453
- Come on!
- Radu, let's go!

[Maddy] Oh, this is not good.

1190
00:54:59.462 --> 00:55:01.755
[Philip] Mr. Norbert?

1191
00:55:02.048 --> 00:55:04.300
[Maddy]
Being controlled like marionettes.

1192
00:55:04.592 --> 00:55:05.759
What the fuck!

1193
00:55:06.052 --> 00:55:07.178
[Radu] Oh, there is Dave!

1194
00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:07.970
Dave, run!

1195
00:55:08.262 --> 00:55:11.682
Oh, he is going to be
the deadest.

1196
00:55:11.974 --> 00:55:13.016
[crowd screaming]

1197
00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:15.185
[Radu] Ahh, the face!

1198
00:55:15.478 --> 00:55:16.812
Oh, that's so gross.

1199
00:55:17.104 --> 00:55:18.647

Get us out of here, Hunter.

[Philip]
We can't let this happen.

1203
00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:25.404
We have to stop it.

00:55:25.696 --> 00:55:26.613
[Radu whimpering]

[Radu] Oh, they see us!

Jesus Christ, thank you!

1209
00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:35.748
- [Hunter] Pastor Beckett!
- I have to get out of here!

1210
00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:39.209
Thank God, Jesus Christ,

[Radu] And then I pulled
the sword out of a tree stump

1218
00:55:52.473 --> 00:55:55.100
and the birdie birds say,
"You are the king!"

1219
00:55:55.393 --> 00:55:56.644
[Maddy] Radu, shh,
we're trying to listen.

[Maddy] Does this crazy plan
even stand a chance?

1226
00:56:06.445 --> 00:56:07.404
[Jim the Newsman] What do these
giant monsters want?

1227
00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:08.322
It'll work
if we build it together.

[Jim the Newsman]
Where are they coming from?
