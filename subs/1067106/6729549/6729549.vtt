00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.760
(up-tempo music plays)

2
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.920
Yes.

3
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.360
Quite dead.

4
00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.160
As a doornail.

5
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.760
Certificate
of death, sir.

6
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.520
(man clears throat)

7
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.200
(exhales deeply)

8
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.880
(floor creaking)

9
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.240
Stop!

10
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.480
Back away, praddock.

11
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.280
(coins jingling)

12
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.600
Tuppence is tuppence.

13
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.040
(chorus singing <i>God Rest Ye</i>
<i>Merry Gentlemen</i> in distance)

14
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.760

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.440
(shouting, whooping)

25
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.240
Delinquents.

26
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.360
(man) Newspaper!

27
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.400
(indistinct chatter)

28
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.800
(dog barking, yelping)

29
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.280
(man shouts)

30
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.320
(medley of
Christmas carols plays)

31
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.800
(boy 1) We're hungry, sir!

32
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.000
(boy 2) Please, sir,
we're very hungry.

33
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.680
(boy 3) Any morsel.
We're hungry, sir.

34
00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.400
(boy 1) Any scraps.
(boy 2) We're starving.

35
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.560
(boy 3) Please, sir.
We're very hungry.

36
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.320
Oh! Merry Christmas,
from his lordship,
the mayor!

37
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.160
(boy 2) Please, sir.
(boy 1) Oh, look.
There it is.

38
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.040
(boy 1) Oi! Come
back here with that!
That's our meat!

39
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.640
Give it back!
That's ours!
Come back here!

40
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.600
There you are, sir.
Thanks.

41
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.000
Fresh hot chestnuts.

42
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.680
How would you
like this one?
That's perfect.

43
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.520
(man) That's a nice
fresh eel.

44
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.200
Here is the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

45
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.800
Get lost.
And under which one
is the pea?

46
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.640
Boom, boom,
boom, boom...

47
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.440
Boom!
Get out of here.
(boy blows raspberry)

48
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.200
There we are.
Watch this now.

49
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.960
(indistinct chatter continues)

50
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.480
(keys jingling)

51
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.400
(door unlocking)

52
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.720
(door creaking)

53
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.600
(ice crackling)

54
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.480
(shuddering)

55
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.560
(door opens)

56
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.560
Merry Christmas, Uncle!

57
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.240
God save you.

58
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.240
Bah! Humbug!

59
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.360
Christmas a humbug?
Uncle! You don't mean that.

60
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.480
Merry Christmas.

61
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.440
What reason have you
to be merry?
You're poor enough.

62
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.640
What right have you
to be so dismal?
You're rich enough.

63
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:03.960
Humbug!

64
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.760
Don't be cross, Uncle.

65
00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.320
What else can I be
when I live in such
a world of fools as this?

66
00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.560
Merry Christmas.

67
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.720
What's Christmastime to you
but a time for paying bills
without money.

68
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.680
A time for finding
yourself a year older
and not a penny richer.

69
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.360
If I could work my will,

70
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.680
every idiot who goes about
with "Merry Christmas"
on his lips

71
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.920
should be boiled
in his own pudding,

72
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.760
and buried
with a stake of holly
through his heart!

73
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.680
Uncle!
Nephew!

74
00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.600
Keep Christmas
in your own way

75
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.720
and let me
keep it in mine.

76
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.600
Keep it?
But you don't keep it!

77
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.400
(Scrooge) Let me
leave it alone then.

78
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.400
Much good
it has ever done you.

79
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.800
There are many things from
which I have derived good
and have not profited.

80
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.960
Christmas being
among them.

81
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.680
But I have always thought
of Christmas as a kind,
charitable time.

82
00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.880
The only time when men
open their shut-up hearts,

83
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.680
and think of all people
as fellow travelers
to the grave,

84
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.520
and not some other race
of creatures bound
on other journeys.

85
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.400
And therefore, Uncle,

86
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.160
although it has never put
a scrap of gold or silver
in my pocket,

87
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.720
I believe
it has done me good,

88
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.080
and I say,
God bless it!

89
00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.440
Let me hear another sound
out of you, Cratchit,

90
00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.960
and you'll keep Christmas
by losing your situation!

91
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.600
You're quite
a powerful speaker, sir.

92
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.720
A wonder you don't go
into Parliament.

93
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.040
Don't be cross, Uncle.

94
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.240
Come,
dine with us tomorrow.

95
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.360
I'll see you
in hell first.

96
00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.840
But why?

97
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.280
Why so cold-hearted,
Uncle? Why?

98
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.840
Why did you get married?

99
00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.680
Because I fell in love.

100
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.200
Because...

101
00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.800
...you fell...

102
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.440
...in love?

103
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.360
Good afternoon.

104
00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.160
I want nothing from you.

105
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.720
I ask nothing of you.
Why can't we be friends?

106
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.280
Good afternoon.

107
00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.880
I'm sorry,
with all my heart,
to find you so resolute.

108
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.720
But I have made the trial
in homage to Christmas,

109
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.720
and therefore,
merry Christmas, Uncle!

110
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.240
Good afternoon!

111
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.640
And a happy New Year!
Good afternoon!

112
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.880
And a very merry Christmas
to you too, Mr. Cratchit.

113
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.200
(Cratchit)
Merry Christmas
to you, sir.

114
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.000
There's another one.
(door opens)

115
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.000
A clerk making
15 shillings a week...
(door closes)

116
00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.120
...and with a wife
and family,

117
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.480
talking about
a merry Christmas.

118
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.920
I'll retire to Bedlam.
(door opens)

119
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.760
Ah. Good afternoon.
Scrooge and Marley's,
I believe?

120
00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.680
Ah...

121
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.520
Have I the pleasure of
addressing Mr. Scrooge
or Mr. Marley?

122
00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.560
Mr. Marley has been dead
these seven years.

123
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.240
He died
seven years ago...
this very night.

124
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.480
Oh...

125
00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.120
Well, we have no doubt

126
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.840
that his generosity,
is well represented
by his surviving partner.

127
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.360
At this festive season
of the year, Mr. Scrooge,

128
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.160
it is more than usually
desirable that we should
make some slight provision,

129
00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.360
for the poor
and the destitute.

130
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.720
Many thousands are in want
of common comfort, sir.

131
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.000
Are there no prisons?

132
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.640
(blows, clears throat)

133
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.720
Prisons? Yes, yes,
plenty of prisons.

134
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.560
And the union workhouses,
are they still in operation?

135
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.080
They are.
I wish I could
say they were not.

136
00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.920
(Scrooge) The treadmill
in full vigor?

137
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.120
Very busy, sir.

138
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.480
Good!

139
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.240
I was afraid something had
occurred to stop them
in their useful course.

140
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:13.160
Yes. At this festive season,
a few of us are endeavoring
to raise a fund

141
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.520
to buy the poor
some meat and drink
and means of warmth.

142
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.080
What shall we
put you down for?

143
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.320
Nothing.

144
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.000
Oh, you wish
to remain anonymous?

145
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.760
I wish to be left alone!

146
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.000
I don't make merry
myself at Christmas,

147
00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.000
and I can't afford
to make idle people merry.

148
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.120
I support
the establishments
I have mentioned.

149
00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.960
And those
who are badly off
must go there.

150
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.760
Many cannot go there.

151
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:48.640
And, well, frankly,
many would rather die.

152
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.520
Then they
had better do it

153
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.760
and decrease
the surplus population.

154
00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.120
Good afternoon,
gentlemen!

155
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.880
Good afternoon.

156
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.320
(door opens)

157
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.200
(church bell tolling)

158
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.160
You'll want all day
tomorrow, I suppose?

159
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.200
Well, if quite
convenient, sir.

160
00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.680
It's not convenient,
and it's not fair.

161
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.040
If I were to dock you
a half a crown for it,

162
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.720
you'd think
yourself ill-used.

163
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.480
And yet you don't
think me ill-used

164
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.360
when I pay
a day's wages
for no work.

165
00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.240
Well, it's only
once a year, sir.

166
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.640
Poor excuse for
picking a man's pocket
every 25th of December.

167
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.360
But I suppose you must
have the whole day.

168
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.720
Be here all the earlier
the next morning.

169
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.400
Sir.

170
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.760
(door rattling)

171
00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.400
(chuckling)

172
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.080
(children shouting)

173
00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.560
(laughing)

174
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.360
Whoa!

175
00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.600
In honor of
Christmas Eve!

176
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.080
(children shouting)

177
00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.160
Whoa!

178
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.320
(laughing)

179
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.520
(gate creaking)

180
00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.520
(gate slam echoing)

181
00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.400
(keys jingling)

182
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.280
Bugger it!

183
00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.160
(Scrooge grunting)

184
00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.760
Where are you? Here!

185
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.480
Why does everything seem
to happen to me?

186
00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.000
(gasps)

187
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.040
(roars)
Ah!

188
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.520
(shouting, grunts)

189
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.000
Get away! Get away!

190
00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.880
(whimpering)

191
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.280
(chuckles nervously)

192
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.360
Ha! Balderdash!

193
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.280
(blowing)

194
00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.760
(tapping)

195
00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.800
(door slam echoes)

196
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.320
I have given myself
the willies. (scoffs)

197
00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.000
That's what it is.

198
00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.520
(ringing softly)

199
00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.200
(bells continue ringing)

200
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.200
(ringing loudly)

201
00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.360
(clock chimes)

202
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.000
(bells ringing)

203
00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.720
(loud ringing)

204
00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.840
(ringing stops)

205
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.440
(door creaking)

206
00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.120
(soft thumping)
(soft rattling)

207
00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.400
(soft rattling
and thumping continues)

208
00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.880
(whimpering)

209
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.680
(chains dragging)
(footsteps thudding)

210
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.400
(noises get louder)

211
00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.760
(noise stops)

212
00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.960
(soft creaking)

213
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.960
(doorknob creaking)

214
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.320
It's all still
a hum... Ah!

215
00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.520
Oh!

216
00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.680
(gasping)

217
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.840
How now!

218
00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.920
What do you want
with me?

219
00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.840
(rasping) Oh, much.

220
00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.920
Who are you?

221
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.040
(man) Ask me who I was.

222
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.720
Who were you then?

223
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.560
In life,
I was your partner,

224
00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.360
Jacob Marley.

225
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.840
Can you sit down?

226
00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.800
I can!

227
00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.400
Do it then.

228
00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.400
(gasps, whimpering)

229
00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.240
You do not
believe in me.

230
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.960
I don't.

231
00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.360
Why do you doubt
your senses?

232
00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.000
Because the littlest
thing can affect them.

233
00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.720
A slight disorder
of the stomach
can make them cheat.

234
00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.160
You may be an undigested
bit of beef.

235
00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.800
A blot of mustard.
A crumb of cheese.

236
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.080
A fragment
of underdone potato.

237
00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.960
There's more of gravy
than of grave about you,
whatever you are.

238
00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.960
(shouting)

239
00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:38.360
Mercy! Dreadful apparition,
why do you trouble me?

240
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:42.880
Man of worldly mind,
do you believe in me
or not?

241
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.760
(Scrooge) I do! I must!

242
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.480
(moaning) Woe!
Woe is me!

243
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.120
You are fettered
in chains. Why?

244
00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.120
I wear the chain
I forged in life.

245
00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.320
I made it link by link
and yard by yard.

246
00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.800
Do you recognize
its pattern?

247
00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:10.040
Can you imagine
the weight and length
of the chain you bear?

248
00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.640
It was as heavy and long
as this seven
Christmas Eves ago.

249
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.640
Oh, yours
is a ponderous chain.

250
00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.000
Jacob,
tell me no more.

251
00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.640
Speak comfort
to me, Jacob.

252
00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.240
I have none to give.

253
00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:40.120
I cannot stay.
I cannot linger anywhere.

254
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:45.520
Mark me, in life,
my spirit never walked
beyond our countinghouse,

255
00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:50.800
never roved beyond
the narrow limits
of our money-changing hole.

256
00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.880
Now endless journeys
lie before me.

257
00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.720
Seven years dead
and traveling
all the time?

258
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.240
The whole time.

259
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.360
No rest, no peace.

260
00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.640
You must've covered a lot
of ground in seven years.

261
00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.600
(Marley shouting)

262
00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.040
(moans) I was blind!

263
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.920
Blind! I could
not see my own life!

264
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.880
Squandered and misused.

265
00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.560
Oh, woe...
Oh, woe is me!

266
00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.400
But you were always
a good man of business!

267
00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.280
Business!

268
00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.160
(Scrooge shouts)

269
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.720
(groaning)

270
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.440
(whimpering)

271
00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.720
Mankind...
was my business.

272
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.120
The common welfare
was my business.

273
00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:54.120
Charity, mercy, forbearance,
and benevolence were all my...

274
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.520
(mumbling)

275
00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.400
(bones cracking)
(groaning)

276
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.320
(gagging)

277
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.240
(gasps)

278
00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.520
(muffled speech)

279
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.400
(Scrooge whimpering)

280
00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.840
Hear me!
My time is nearly gone.

281
00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.880
I will. But don't
be hard upon me, Jacob.
Pray.

282
00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.960
I am here
to warn you,

283
00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:25.560
that you have yet
a chance at a hope
of escaping my fate.

284
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.120
A chance of
my procuring, Ebenezer.

285
00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.320
You were always
a good friend
to me, Jacob.

286
00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.760
Thank 'ee.

287
00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.120
You will be haunted
by three spirits.

288
00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.480
That's the chance
and hope?

289
00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:46.840
I'd rather not.

290
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.720
Expect the first tomorrow
when the bell tolls one.

291
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.440
Couldn't I take them
all at once,

292
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.640
and have it
over with, Jacob?

293
00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.680
Expect the second
the next night
at the same hour.

294
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.680
And the third
upon the next night,

295
00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:10.160
when the last stroke of 12
has ceased to vibrate.

296
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.680
(panting)

297
00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.960
(chains rattle)

298
00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:22.520
Look to see me no more.

299
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.520
(chains rattle)

300
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.320
Ah! (moaning)

301
00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.320
(ghosts shouting)
(ghosts moaning)

302
00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.520
Ah!

303
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.440
(ghosts moaning)

304
00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.520
(ghost) I'm sorry.

305
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.040
I wish I could help you.

306
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.080
(Scrooge yells)

307
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.120
Ah!
(growling)

308
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.360
Oh! (whimpering)

309
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.240
Ah!

310
00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.160
(whimpering)

311
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.760
(sighs)
(bell tolls once)

312
00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.400
(gasps)

313
00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:52.960
Ah!

314
00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.440
(whimpering, mumbling)

315
00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:20.920
Are you the spirit
whose coming
was foretold to me?

316
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.480
I am.

317
00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.520
(gasps)

318
00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.400
Is it possible that
you might put
your cap on?

319
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:48.400
Would you so soon put out,
with your worldly hands,

320
00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:52.640
the light I give?

321
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.760
No, no! No, no!
I'm so sorry.

322
00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.600
I meant nothing by it.

323
00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.840
I meant no offense.
I just thought I...

324
00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:18.680
Who and what are you?

325
00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.920
I am the Ghost
of Christmas Past.

326
00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.360
Long past?

327
00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.680
Your past.

328
00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.520
Rise.

329
00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:43.120
And walk with me.

330
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.200
(muttering, gasping)

331
00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:03.560
But I am mortal
and liable to fall.

332
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:07.520
Bear but a touch
of my hand there...

333
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.360
...and you shall be upheld
in more than this.

334
00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.360
(Scrooge) Whoa!

335
00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.320
(moaning)

336
00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.440
(church bells ringing)

337
00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.400
Good heavens.

338
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.440
I was bred
in this place.

339
00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.320
I was a boy here.

340
00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:12.520
Your lip...
is trembling.

341
00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.760
And what's that?

342
00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:22.080
(gasps) On your cheek?

343
00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.440
Nothing.

344
00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.000
Something in my eye.

345
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.120
(sniffs)

346
00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.920
Do you remember the way?

347
00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.320
(laughs) Remember it?

348
00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.640
I could walk it
blindfolded.

349
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.640
(children shouting)
Giddyup! Giddyup!

350
00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.960
(all shouting)

351
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.960
Oh! Whoa!

352
00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:53.040
These are
but shadows of things
that have been.

353
00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:59.400
They have
no consciousness... of us.

354
00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.520
(children singing
<i>The Wassail Song)</i>

355
00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.640
<i>♪ Love and joy ♪♪</i>

356
00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.840
(Scrooge) I knew them.

357
00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.480
(laughing) I know
every one of them.

358
00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.520
They were
schoolmates of mine.

359
00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.800
Let's go on.

360
00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.200
(bell tolls)

361
00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.120
This...

362
00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.480
This was my school.

363
00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.200
This school is
not quite deserted.

364
00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.520
A solitary child...

365
00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.640
...neglected by
his friends...

366
00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:51.040
...is left here still.

367
00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.680
I know.

368
00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.000
(singing <i>O' Come All Ye</i>
<i>Faithful</i> softly in Latin)

369
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.080
(Scrooge) Poor boy.

370
00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.600
Poor, poor boy.

371
00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:46.440
Let's...
see another Christmas.

372
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.800
Ebenezer!

373
00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.440
Ebenezer!

374
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.080
Dear, dear brother!
I've come to
bring you home!

375
00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.560
Home, little Fan?

376
00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.000
Yes, home!

377
00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.200
Father is so much kinder
than he used to be.

378
00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.080
He spoke so gently
to me one night.

379
00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:34.240
I was not afraid to ask him
if you might come home.

380
00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.280
And he said yes!

381
00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.920
And he sent me
in a coach to fetch you.

382
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.360
And we're to be together
all the Christmas long.

383
00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.480
And to have
the merriest time
in all the world!

384
00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.040
You're quite a woman,
little Fan.

385
00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.240
She had a large heart.

386
00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.320
She died a woman.

387
00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:02.160
And had, as I think...

388
00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:04.920
...children.

389
00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.080
Yes, one child.

390
00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:12.640
True. Your nephew.

391
00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:13.840
Yes.

392
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.120
Do you know
this place?

393
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.760
(Scrooge laughing)

394
00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:42.400
Know it?
I was an apprentice here!

395
00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.480
Why, it's old Fezziwig.

396
00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.520
Bless his heart!
It's Fezziwig
alive again!

397
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.120
(bell tolls)

398
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.640
(laughing)

399
00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.600
Yo-ho!
Ebenezer, come on!

400
00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.400
Come on!
Dick! Come on!

401
00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:07.040
It's 6:00.
They're going to
be here soon.

402
00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.560
(laughing)

403
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.160
Dick Wilkins.
Bless me, yes.

404
00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.680
There he is,
Dick Wilkins.

405
00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.240
He was very attached
to me, was Dick.

406
00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.800
(laughter)

407
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.800
Yo-ho, me lads!
No more work tonight.

408
00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.040
It's Christmas Eve!

409
00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.360
Hooray!

410
00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.120
Dick, Ebenezer,
let's get cleared away.

411
00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.640
We want lots of space.
Lots and lots of space.

412
00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:32.560
Hee-hi!

413
00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:35.920
Whoa!

414
00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.560
(up-tempo music playing)
(indistinct chatter)

415
00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.400
Maestro!

416
00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.920
May I present...?!

417
00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.840
Whoo!

418
00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.200
Whoo!

419
00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.320
(gasps, laughs)

420
00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.640
(Fezziwig laughing)

421
00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:27.760
Well done! Well done!

422
00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:32.920
And now, kind fiddler,
if you please.

423
00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:36.680
It is time for
Sir Roger de Coverley!

424
00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:38.720
(all chattering)
Hey!

425
00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.520
(up-tempo music plays)

426
00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.800
(all shouting, laughing)

427
00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.440
Might I have this dance
with you?

428
00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.400
Whoo! (laughs)
(laughs)

429
00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.360
Ebenezer,
it's your pass.

430
00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.680
(music fades)

431
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.520
(soft classical music plays)

432
00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:16.600
(woman) Another idol
has replaced me.

433
00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.840
(young Scrooge)
Another idol?
What idol?

434
00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.120
A golden one.

435
00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.040
There is nothing
on this earth

436
00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.360
more terrifying to me
than a life doomed
to poverty.

437
00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.080
May I ask,
why do you condemn,

438
00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:36.880
with such severity,
the honest pursuit
of substance?

439
00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.520
You fear the world
too much, Ebenezer.

440
00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:43.120
(Scrooge sighs)

441
00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:45.720
You've changed.
Changed?

442
00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.960
Perhaps grown wiser,
but I have not changed
toward you.

443
00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.240
Our contract
is an old one.

444
00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:55.800
It was made when
we were both poor
and content to be so.

445
00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.800
When it was made...

446
00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.680
You were another man.

447
00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.640
I was a boy!

448
00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.880
I release you,
Ebenezer.

449
00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:17.800
Have I ever
sought release?

450
00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.160
In words, no.

451
00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.800
In what, then?

452
00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.000
In an altered spirit.

453
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.160
In another
atmosphere of life.

454
00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:33.040
In everything
that made my love of
any worth in your sight.

455
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:39.280
Tell me, Ebenezer,
if this contract had
never been between us,

456
00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.360
would you
seek me out now?

457
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.080
No.

458
00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.640
You think not?

459
00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:54.080
I would gladly think
otherwise if I could.

460
00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:00.360
But if you were free today,
would you choose
a dowerless girl?

461
00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:04.360
A girl left penniless
by the death
of her parents?

462
00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:08.080
You, who weighs
everything by gain?

463
00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.560
I release you,
Ebenezer.

464
00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:19.120
May you be happy
in the life you've chosen.

465
00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:25.040
(door opens, shuts)

466
00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:28.160
Spirit, remove me
from this place.

467
00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:32.120
I told you,
these were shadows of
things that have been.

468
00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:35.640
They are what they are.
Do not blame me.

469
00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:38.080
Remove me.
I cannot bear it.

470
00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:54.320
Leave me!
Take me back!

471
00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.120
Haunt me no longer!

472
00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.840
(groaning)

473
00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:03.680
(shouting)

474
00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.160
(laughs)

475
00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.600
(yelling)

476
00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.720
(screaming)

477
00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.960
(shouting)

478
00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.640
Ah! Oh!

479
00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.360
(whimpering)

480
00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.200
(yelling)

481
00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:41.640
(shouting)

482
00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.200
Ah! Ah!

483
00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:58.040
(grunts) Oh, blast!

484
00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.160
(bell tolls once)

485
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.000
(ghostly chuckling)

486
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.360
(laughter continues)

487
00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:33.040
(ghost) Enter, Scrooge!

488
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.880
(tinkling music plays)

489
00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.120
(ghost chuckling)

490
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.960
(continues chuckling loudly)

491
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:13.120
Come in! Come in
and know me better, man!

492
00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.040
(guffaws)

493
00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:23.560
I am the Ghost
of Christmas Present.

494
00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.240
Look upon me!

495
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.440
(whimpers)

496
00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.240
(laughing)

497
00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:39.760
You have never seen
the likes of me before?

498
00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:44.920
Never.

499
00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:48.920
Have never walked forth
with my elder brothers?

500
00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.760
I don't think
that I have.

501
00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.760
You have many brothers?

502
00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.240
(chortling)

503
00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.120
More than 1,800.

504
00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:12.680
1,842, to be exact.

505
00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:15.960
Oh. (laughs)

506
00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:23.800
I see you wear a scabbard,
but no sword.

507
00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.400
Indeed.

508
00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:35.120
Peace on Earth.
Goodwill toward men.

509
00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:42.360
Spirit, conduct me
where you will.

510
00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.480
(laughs)

511
00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:54.840
Oh...

512
00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:59.520
Touch my robe.

513
00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:01.360
(laughing)

514
00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.200
(laughing loudly)

515
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.240
Oh! What's happening?
What are you doing?

516
00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.240
(Ghost of Christmas Present
laughs)
(Scrooge) Ah!

517
00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.920

518
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.160

537
00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:26.400
(Scrooge laughs)
It's quite beautiful.

538
00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:55.720
Spirit, these poor people
have no means
to cook their food.

539
00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:57.680
And yet you seek
to close the only places,

540
00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:01.440
in which they can
warm their meager meals,
every seventh day.

541
00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.360
(rumbling)
Oh!

542
00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.960
(Ghost of Christmas Present)
Hear me, Scrooge.

543
00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:16.720
There are some
upon this earth of yours

544
00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:20.160
who claim to know me
and my brothers,

545
00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:24.480
and do their deeds of ill will
and selfishness in our name.

546
00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:28.120
These so-called
"men of the cloth"

547
00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:33.280
are as strange
to me and my kin
as if they never lived.

548
00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:37.400
Charge their doings
to them, not us.

549
00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:41.520
Aye. I will.

550
00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.760
(boy) Smell that?

551
00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:50.480
(girl) Cooking goose!

552
00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.640
(boy) Come on!

553
00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.560

(Scrooge) I take it this
bleak paupers' dwelling
is of some significance.

559
00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:21.800
(Ghost of Christmas Present)
It is all your loyal clerk
can afford

560
00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:24.200
for his meager
15 bob a week.

561
00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.200
(boy) Mother!
(girl) Papa!

562
00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:28.000
We just came
by the baker shop.

563
00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.600
And smelled our goose,
cooking delicious.

564
00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.240
(Mother) Shut the door,
please.

565
00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:35.840
What happened to
your precious father?
And your brother.

566
00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:39.160
And Martha,
she wasn't as late
last Christmas Day.

567
00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:41.680
(girl) Mother,
here she is, Mother.
Here's Martha.

568
00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:43.680
(boy) Martha! Wait till
you see our goose.

569
00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:45.000
'Tis a, wonderful one.

570
00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.120
(Mother) Peter,
off with you to the baker's
and collect the bird.

571
00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.640
And take
the children with you.

572
00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:51.000
And pray, no dallying.

573
00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.600
Why, bless your
heart alive!

574
00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:54.600
Dear, how late you are!

575
00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:58.000
We had a deal of work to
finish up last night and
clear away this morning.

576
00:52:58.080 --> 00:52:59.880
Never mind.
Long as you're here.

577
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:02.240
Sit ye down before
the fire and
have a warm.

578
00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:04.640
No. No, no, no.
There's Father coming.

579
00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:06.840
You must hide.
Hide, Martha.

580
00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:08.800
(laughing)

581
00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:12.440
(grunts)

582
00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:15.560
(door opens)

583
00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.480
It's cold out there.

584
00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:21.680
(woman) Hello, Father.
Hello, Timmy.

585
00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:30.160
Why, where's our Martha?
Uh... Not coming.

586
00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:33.880
Not coming?

587
00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:36.000
Not coming
upon Christmas Day?

588
00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.600
Here I am, Father!
(laughter)

589
00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:42.160
We got you, Father.

590
00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:45.000
I couldn't bear
to see you in a
state of disappointment.

591
00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.320
If only for a giggle.

592
00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:49.120
It's so lovely
to see you, my Martha.

593
00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:51.840
Come on, Timmy.
I hear the pudding
singing in the copper.

594
00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:54.000
Shall we
have a look, then?

595
00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:59.400
How did little Timmy behave?
As good as gold.
And better.

596
00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.280
Somehow he gets
thoughtful sitting
by himself so much,

597
00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:05.360
he thinks
the strangest things
you ever heard.

598
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:09.640
He told me, coming home,
that he hoped the people
sawed him in church,

599
00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.800
because he was a cripple...

600
00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:16.160
...and it might make pleasant
for them to remember it
upon Christmas Day

601
00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:19.600
who made
lame beggars walk
and blind men see.

602
00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:27.840
I believe he grows
more hearty and stronger
every day, my dear.

603
00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:31.320
(halting footsteps approach)

604
00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:39.240
The pudding
looks delicious!

605
00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:43.040
The whole wash house
smells like a
pastry cook's shop.

606
00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:47.760
Spirit, tell me

607
00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:50.160
will Tiny Tim...

608
00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:52.600
I see a vacant seat

609
00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:55.920
in the poor
chimney corner

610
00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.040
and a crutch
without an owner.

611
00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:06.240
Carefully preserved.

612
00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:12.120
Hurrah!
The Christmas goose!

613
00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:15.800
(Mother) Make space.
Let's get that cover off.

614
00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:18.480
(all) Oh!
(Mother) Lovely!
Well done, Peter.

615
00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:22.120
I don't believe
I've ever seen a more
magnificent goose cooked.

616
00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:24.920
It is a beautiful bird
that's for sure.

617
00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:28.800
But I'll pray that
one Christmas,
perhaps,

618
00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:31.000
the children
might taste a turkey.

619
00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:34.200
Perhaps one day, my dear.
Perhaps one day.

620
00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:36.480
A toast.

621
00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:41.520
To Mr. Scrooge.

622
00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:45.600
The founder of our feast.
(Mother) Ha!

623
00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:49.560
Founder of the feast,
indeed.
I wish I had him here.

624
00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:51.320
I'd give him
a piece of my mind
to feast upon,

625
00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:53.640
and I'd hope he'd have
a good appetite for it.

626
00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:57.320
(Cratchit) My dear,
the children
It's Christmas Day.

627
00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:59.360
Christmas Day, I'm sure.
How can one drink the health

628
00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:04.160
of such an odious, stingy,
hard, unfeeling man
as Mr. Scrooge?

629
00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:08.000
As you know he is, Robert,
nobody knows it
better than you.

630
00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:10.880
My dear,
Christmas Day.

631
00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:16.320
I'll drink his health
for your sake and
the day's, not for his.

632
00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:21.240
(Mother)
A merry Christmas
and a happy New Year.

633
00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:24.840
He'll be very merry
and very happy,
I have no doubt.

634
00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:29.440
A merry Christmas
to us all, my dears.
God bless us.

635
00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:31.600
(all) God bless us.

636
00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:34.680
God bless us, everyone.
(laughter)

637
00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:39.080
Merry Christmas
and happy New Year.
God bless.

638
00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:43.680
Kind spirit,
say Tiny Tim
will be spared.

639
00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:47.520
If these shadows
remain unaltered,
by the future...

640
00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:51.400
The child will die.

641
00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:54.120
Die! No, spirit. No.

642
00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:01.200
What then?
If he is to die,
he had better do it.

643
00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:05.680
And decrease
the surplus population.

644
00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:19.440
(laughing)

645
00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.920
(voices laughing)

646
00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:30.560
(man) So you're thinking
of an animal?
(man 2) Yes.

647
00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:32.400
(woman) A live animal?
(man 2) Yes.

648
00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:34.880
A rather
disagreeable animal?
Yes.

649
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.400
A savage animal?
Yes.

650
00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:39.440
Wait, wait!
Is it an animal that
grunts and growls?

651
00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:40.600
Yes!

652
00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:42.600
And lives in London?
Yes.

653
00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:43.680
A horse?
No.

654
00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:44.720
A cow?
No.

655
00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:45.800
A dog?

656
00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:46.840
A pig?
No.

657
00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:48.200
An ass?

658
00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.080
Yes and no.
Oh!

659
00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:55.640
Oh! I know who it is, Fred!
I know!
It's your Uncle Scrooge!

660
00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:57.440
Yes.
(laughter)

661
00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:08.640
(man) Christmas a humbug?
Now, he actually
said that?

662
00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:11.440
(Fred) As I live.
And he believes it.

663
00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:14.800
(woman)
I have no patience
with him, Fred.

664
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
I have.
I'm sorry for him.

665
00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:20.640
Who suffers from his
ill whims? Only himself.

666
00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:23.920
He decides to dislike us,
won't come and dine with us,

667
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.880
and what's
the consequence?
He loses a dinner.

668
00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:29.360
Indeed, he loses a
very good dinner.
(man) Hear, hear.

669
00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.840
A magnificent dinner.
(woman) Great.

670
00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:35.680
He's certainly
given us plenty of merriment,
that's for sure,

671
00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:38.320
and I think it would be
ungrateful not to drink
to his health.

672
00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:42.400
He wouldn't take it
from me, but he may
have it nevertheless.

673
00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:45.800
A merry Christmas to the
old man, whatever he is.
Uncle Scrooge.

674
00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:48.720
(all) To Uncle Scrooge
(bell tolls)

675
00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:57.200
(bell tolls)
(clock ticking)

676
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.080
Are spirits' lives
so short?

677
00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:08.880
My life upon this globe
is very brief.

678
00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:12.560
It ends tonight.

679
00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:17.280
Tonight?
Tonight at midnight.

680
00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:18.880
(clattering)

681
00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:21.000
Hark.

682
00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:24.320
The time is
drawing near.

683
00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:27.240
(gears clattering)
(loud ticking)

684
00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:35.800
Forgive me...

685
00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:39.880
But I see something
strange protruding
from your skirt.

686
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.880
Is it a foot
or a claw?

687
00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:47.560
It might be a claw,
for the scant amount of
flesh there is upon it.

688
00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:51.880
Look here.

689
00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:54.920
(child snarls) Naff off!

690
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.640
(Ghost of Christmas Present)
Oh, man. Look here.

691
00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:59.360
(child)
You daft old geezer.

692
00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:02.080
Look! Look!
(whimpering)

693
01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.720
Down here!
(gasping)

694
01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.680
(hissing, snarling)

695
01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:09.840
Go away!

696
01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.240
Are they yours?

697
01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.440
They are man's.

698
01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:18.480
This boy is Ignorance.
(hissing)

699
01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.360
This girl is Want.
(moans)

700
01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.680
Beware them both.

701
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.920
(bell tolls loudly)
Oh!

702
01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:29.920
Ah!

703
01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.480
(bell tolls loudly)
Ah!

704
01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.600
(gasps, laughing)
(bell tolls loudly)

705
01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.600
(moaning)

706
01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:48.160
Have they no refuge?
No resource?

707
01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.480
(bell tolls)

708
01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.280
Are there no prisons?

709
01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:55.520
(bell tolls)

710
01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.800
Are there
no workhouses
(laughing)

711
01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.080
(bell tolls)
(laughing)

712
01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:07.720
(bell tolls)

713
01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.120
(Want screaming)

714
01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.800
(bell tolls)

715
01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.200
(bell tolls)
(laughing)

716
01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.200
(bell tolls)
(wind howling)

717
01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:30.320
(laughing)
(bell tolls)

718
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.400
(bell tolls)

719
01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.040
(wind howling)

720
01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.720
(clock ticking)

721
01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.680
(whimpering)
(clock ticking)

722
01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:11.880
Am I in the presence
of the Ghost of Christmas
Yet to Come?

723
01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.960
You're about
to show me shadows
of the things that have

724
01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:20.120
not happened
but will happen.
Is that so, spirit?

725
01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:26.240
Ghost of the Future,
I fear you more than
any specter I have seen.

726
01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:29.120
But I know your purpose
is to do me good.

727
01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.160
I am prepared
to bear you company.

728
01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.960
Lead on.

729
01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.720
The night is waning fast.
It's precious time to me.

730
01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:43.840
Lead on, spirit.

731
01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.480
(yelling)

732
01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:00.320
When did he die?
Last night, I believe.

733
01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:03.960
Or sometime Christmas Day.
(man) I thought
he'd never die.

734
01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:08.080
(man 2) What's he done
with his money?
Hasn't left it to me.

735
01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.800
That's all I know.
(men laughing)

736
01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:13.720
It is likely to be
a cheap funeral.

737
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.000
For the life of me,
I can't think of anyone
who'd want to attend it.

738
01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:19.080
I don't mind going...

739
01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.680
If lunch is provided.

740
01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.440
There, yes.
(men laughing)

741
01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.480
What a frightful fellow.

742
01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.760
All right.
Good day,
gentlemen.

743
01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:38.600
Get a hold
of yourself, Ebenezer.
You're having a wobbly.

744
01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.160
(hoof beats approaching)

745
01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.360
(horses grunting)

746
01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.640
(growling)
(gasps)

747
01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.360
(whip snaps)

748
01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:52.920
(gasps)

749
01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.360
(whimpering)

750
01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:06.640
(moaning)

751
01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:24.920
(shouting)

752
01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.400
(laughing)

753
01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.280
Whoo!

754
01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:39.240
(screaming, laughing)

755
01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.320
Oh! Oh!

756
01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.480
(shouting)

757
01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:49.680
(moaning)

758
01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:58.200
(whip snaps)
(neighing)

759
01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:08.440
(roaring)

760
01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.280
(whip snaps)
(moaning)

761
01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.520
(screeching)

762
01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.640
(panting, grunts)

763
01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.840
You won't get me in here.

764
01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.640
Christmas pudding,
no doubt.

765
01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.560
(gasping)

766
01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.160
(grunting)

767
01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:02.480
I'm... I'm on Lime Street.

768
01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:06.160
(horses whinnying)

769
01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.320
(high-pitched)
Oh, come now.

770
01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:14.360
(horses whinny)

771
01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.080
(shouting)

772
01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.720
(grunting)

773
01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:47.680
(screams)

774
01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.280
(shouting)

775
01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.720
Oh!

776
01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.480
Ah!

777
01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.320
Whoa!

778
01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:30.880
(shouting)

779
01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:33.360
(screaming)

780
01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:43.840
(creaking)
(woman) Merry Christmas,
Joe.

781
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.680
(Joe) And happy New Year,
to be sure. Come in.

782
01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:51.360
Sit down in me parlor
and let's have a look.

783
01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:56.680
(humming)

784
01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.600
Here.

785
01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:01.840
Whoa!

786
01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:04.200
What do you call these,
Mrs. Dilber, huh?

787
01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:05.640
(high-pitched)
Mrs. Dilber?

788
01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:10.280
Bed curtains. (laughs)

789
01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:14.680
You mean to say
you took them down
while he was lying there?

790
01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:16.800
(laughing) I do.

791
01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:18.800
And why not?
(laughing)

792
01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:24.440
You was born
to make your fortune,
and you certainly will do it.

793
01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.640
(Mrs. Dilber)
Well, I shan't
hold back my hand

794
01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:28.640
when I can get
something by it...

795
01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.560
Don't you go getting grease
on them blankets now.

796
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.560
His blankets?
Whose else
do you think?

797
01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:39.440
He won't be feeling
the cold without
them now, I dare say.

798
01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:42.080
I hope he didn't die
of anything catching.

799
01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:44.560
Don't you
be afeard of that.

800
01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:48.320
I ain't so fond
of his company
that I'd loiter about.

801
01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:49.920
(Joe laughs)

802
01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:56.320
You can
look through that shirt
till your eyes ache,

803
01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.000
and you won't find
one hole in it.

804
01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:02.960
It was the
best he had.
(high-pitched) Mrs. Dilber!

805
01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:05.360
(Mrs. Dilber) Would have
been wasted, only for me.

806
01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:09.200
You're fired! Fired!
How did you mean
"wasted"?

807
01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:15.720
Somebody was fool enough
to put it on him
to be buried in.

808
01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:19.440
(Joe laughs)
(Mrs. Dilber)
But I took it off him.

809
01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.360
(laughter)

810
01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:25.880
This is
the end of it,
you see.

811
01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:29.800
He frightened
everyone away
while he was alive.

812
01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:33.800
Only to profit us
now that he's dead.

813
01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:40.040
If he'd had somebody
to look after him
he was struck with death,

814
01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:45.400
instead of lying there
all alone, gasping out
his last breath...

815
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.640
...well, we wouldn't
have these things
to sell now, would we?

816
01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.160
(sniffing)

817
01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:51.880
(squealing)

818
01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:53.760
Hey!

819
01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:56.200
(screaming)

820
01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.120
Whoa!

821
01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:10.800
(shouting)

822
01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:18.000
Spirit! I see! I see!

823
01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:22.440
(voice deepens) The case of
this unhappy man who dies,
a solitary, lonesome death

824
01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:24.120
might be my own.

825
01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.440
(normal voice)
My life tends
that way now.

826
01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.280
Merciful heavens!
What's this?

827
01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:54.160
Spirit, this is
a fearful place.

828
01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.960
When I leave it,
I shall not
leave its lesson.

829
01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:59.200
Trust me. Let's go!

830
01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:16.480
I understand.
And I would, if I could
but I have not the power.

831
01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:34.240
Spirit, if there is
any person who feels emotion
caused by this man's death,

832
01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.480
show that
person to me
I beg you.

833
01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:53.280
(woman) Are we ruined?
(man) There is hope yet.

834
01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:57.520
(woman) Hope?
Only if he relents.

835
01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:00.680
He is past
relenting.

836
01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.160
He is dead.

837
01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:06.160
Dead?

838
01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.880
(laughing)

839
01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.640
To whom will our debts
be transferred?

840
01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.440
I don't know, but by then
we'll have the money

841
01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.760
and even
if we don't,

842
01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:19.400
it's unlikely any
new creditor will
ever be so merciless.

843
01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:23.280
(man) We shall
sleep tonight with
light hearts, my dear.

844
01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:26.480
Let me see
some tenderness
connected to death,

845
01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:29.120
or this chamber
will forever
haunt me!

846
01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:32.040
(clock chiming)

847
01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:43.880
It's late.

848
01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:46.920
Past your
father's time.

849
01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.920
He's walked slow
these last
few evenings.

850
01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:55.040
Oh, he has walked...

851
01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:59.720
...with Tiny Tim
on his shoulders...
Fast, indeed.

852
01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.560
But he was
very light...

853
01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:07.840
...to carry, and...

854
01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.560
...your father
loved him so.

855
01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.040
(sobbing)

856
01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.480
(girl) Father.
(Mother) You went today,
then?

857
01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.280
Yes, my dear.

858
01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:31.760
I wish
you could
have gone.

859
01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:35.120
Would have done you
good to see how
green a place it is.

860
01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:38.280
You'll see it often.

861
01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:42.680
And I promised him
I would walk there every...

862
01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:45.400
(sobbing) every Sunday.

863
01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.360
(sobbing)
My little child!

864
01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:51.960
My little child.

865
01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:56.760
Father, please
don't be grieved.
Please, Father.

866
01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.760
I'm all right, love.
I'm quite at peace.

867
01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:05.960
I'm sure none of us
will ever forget
our poor Tiny Tim.

868
01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:08.800
(boy) Oh, no, Father.
(girl) Never ever.

869
01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:11.480
(Cratchit) Thank you.

870
01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.120
Thank you, my dears.

871
01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.320
(gasping)

872
01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:41.760
(Scrooge) Bob.

873
01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.880
(Scrooge gasps)

874
01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:05.920
(Cratchit sobbing)

875
01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:10.360
Specter...

876
01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.920
Something tells me
our parting moment
is at hand.

877
01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:16.480
Tell me...

878
01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:18.840
...who

879
01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:22.720
...was that man
we saw lying dead?

880
01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:26.840
(explosion)
(screaming)

881
01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:37.200
(grunting)

882
01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:42.320
(thunder crashes)

883
01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:47.600
(wind howling)

884
01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:51.240
(thunder crashes)

885
01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:57.760
Spirit...

886
01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:04.680
...before I draw
nearer to that stone
to which you point,

887
01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.920
answer me one question!

888
01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.920
Are these the shadows
of things that will be

889
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:12.160
or shadows
of things
that may be?

890
01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:15.920
Men's courses in life
foreshadow certain ends.

891
01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:19.920
But if these courses are
departed from, these ends
will change. Isn't that so?

892
01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:26.080
(thunder crashes)
(Scrooge) No. No!

893
01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:29.200
Am I that man
who lay upon the bed?

894
01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:35.760
(thunder crashes)
No. Spirit, hear me!

895
01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.400
I'm not the man I was!

896
01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.800
Why show me this
if I'm past all hope?

897
01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:44.160
Spirit!

898
01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:47.400
Spirit, assure me
that I may change these
shadows you've shown me!

899
01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:50.080
Change them
by an altered life!

900
01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.800
(thunder crashes)

901
01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:56.440
No, spirit! No!
No, spirit!

902
01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.640
(grunting)

903
01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:02.320
(straining)

904
01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:07.400
Good spirit...
Help me!

905
01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:10.000
Spirit!

906
01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.000
Help me, spirit!

907
01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:17.840
(grunting)

908
01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.560
(screams, moaning)

909
01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:31.240
(coffin door creaks)
Ah!

910
01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:35.600
(screaming)

911
01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:39.880
Help, spirit!

912
01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:49.240
(screams)

913
01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:55.680
Spirit, I will honor
Christmas in my heart and
try to keep it all the year.

914
01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:59.480
I will not shut out
the lessons of the past,
nor present, nor future.

915
01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:01.680
Oh, please, spirit,

916
01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:06.280
tell me I may
sponge away the
writing on that stone!

917
01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:09.040
(wind howling)

918
01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:12.480
(screaming)

919
01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:18.120
(shouting)

920
01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.720
(crashing)

921
01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:35.920
(whimpering)

922
01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:53.760
(grunting)

923
01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:00.880
Still here?

924
01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:05.000
They're still here.
(laughing)

925
01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.000
I'm still here.

926
01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:09.480
(laughing)
I'm still here.

927
01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.760
I'm still here!

928
01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:15.800
(laughing)

929
01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.080
I don't know
what to do.

930
01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:23.600
I'm light as a feather,
merry as a schoolboy.

931
01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:28.200
I've heard
that laugh before.

932
01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:30.680
(chuckling)

933
01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:33.440
Ah!

934
01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:39.280
I say, what's today?
(boy) Eh?

935
01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:42.440
What's today,
my fine fellow?

936
01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:45.040
Today?
Why, Christmas Day.

937
01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:48.720
It's Christmas Day?
I haven't missed it.

938
01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:50.880
The spirits have done it
all in one night.

939
01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:52.720
They can do
anything they like
of course they can.

940
01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:54.080
Of, course they can.

941
01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:57.240
Hello, my fine fellow.
Do you know the
poulterer's on the corner?

942
01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:58.640
(boy) I should
hope I did.

943
01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.600
(laughs)
What an intelligent boy.

944
01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:04.240
Do you know whether
they've sold the prize turkey
that was hanging there?

945
01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.560
Not the little
prize turkey,
the big one.

946
01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:10.440
The one as big as me?
(laughing) What
a delightful child.

947
01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:15.840
Yes, my buck.
(boy) It's hanging
there now.

948
01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.840
Is it? Go and buy it, then!

949
01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:22.160
Walker!
No, no, I'm in earnest.

950
01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:25.800
Go and buy it,
bring it back here,
and I'll give you a shilling.

951
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.600
Come back in less than
five minutes, and I'll
give you a half a crown.

952
01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:33.360
I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's
he shan't know who sent it.

953
01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:36.440
It's twice the size
of Tiny Tim.

954
01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:38.200
(laughing)

955
01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:41.720
Mrs. Dilber.

956
01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:44.680
Merry Christmas!

957
01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.560
(gasping) Oh, my God!

958
01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:50.880
(screaming)

959
01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:52.880
He's gone mad!

960
01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:56.080
(Scrooge) Yay!

961
01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:00.280
My dear Mrs. Dilber,

962
01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:03.560
you're the
loveliest creature
I have ever laid eyes upon.

963
01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:06.600
Dance with me!
Mrs. Dilber.
Dance with me!

964
01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:10.560
You're barmy, Mr. Scrooge!
Unhand me! (screams)

965
01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:14.320
He's completely
deranged! Help!

966
01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:17.440
What a charming woman.
(Mrs. Dilber) Help!

967
01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:23.600
I shall love it
as long as I live.

968
01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:25.520
What an honest face
it has.

969
01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:27.280
Ooh! (chuckles)

970
01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.360
Hello.
Here's the bird.

971
01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:33.760
Hello! Whoop! (laughs)

972
01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:36.080
How are you?
Merry Christmas.

973
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.400
Why, it's impossible
to carry that to
Camden Town.

974
01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:41.600
You must have a cab.

975
01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:45.880
Drive on,
my good man!

976
01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:49.960
(Scrooge laughs)

977
01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:57.320
Hilly-ho! Chirrup!

978
01:22:58.160 --> 01:22:59.400
(laughs)

979
01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:04.120
Yahoo! (laughs)

980
01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:08.600
Hip, hip!
Chirry-up!

981
01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:10.880
Bob's your uncle!
Fanny's your aunt!

982
01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:13.520
Here's your
aunt's fanny.
(laughs)

983
01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:18.760
Live it up, folks!
You'll be a long time dead!

984
01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:21.680
Don't let the worms
have all the fun.

985
01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:30.520
Merry Christmas.

Mr. Scrooge?

1001
01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:15.880
Yes. That is my name,
and I fear it may not
be pleasant to you.

1002
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.320
But allow me
to ask your pardon.

1003

Yes, sir.

(Fred) Yes.

1021
01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:57.920
(man 2) And lives
in London?
(Fred) Yes.

1022
01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.000
(man 3) A horse?
(Fred) No.

(Fred) No.

1024

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:03.960
(woman) An ass.

1027
01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:06.440
(Fred) Yes and no.

1028
01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:09.320
I know what it is, Fred!
I know!
(Fred) What?

1029
01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:11.160
It's your...
(door creaking)

1030
01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:14.040
Uncle Scrooge?

1031
01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.120
Well, bless my soul.

1032
01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:23.280
I've...
Come to dinner...

1033
01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:27.640
...if you'll have me.

1034
01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:35.200
Of course, Uncle!
Welcome! Welcome!

1035
01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:38.680
Merry Christmas!
Everybody, this is
my uncle, Ebenezer.

1036
01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:40.520
(indistinct chatter)

1037
01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:47.600
Be good and
pass this.

1038
01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.800
Here you go.
Enjoy.

1039
01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:53.640
Next year we must
have this dinner
at my house.

1040
01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:55.720
I insist.

1041
01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:58.440
I'll spare no expense.

1042
01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:00.600
After all, you can't
take it with you,
can you?

1043
01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:02.920
No, you can't.
(laughter)

1044

(clock ticking)

1045
01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:35.240
(laughs)
A full
16 minutes late.

1046
01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:42.840
What do you mean
by coming here
at this time of day?

1047
01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:47.480
I'm very sorry, sir.
I am a bit behind
in my time.

1048
01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.240
You are, indeed.

1049
01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:52.800
Step in here.

1050
01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:58.320
Well, it's only
once a year, sir.

1051
01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:01.640
It shall not be repeated.
I was making rather
merry yesterday.

1052
01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:04.320
Now, I'll tell you what,
Mr. Cratchit.

1053
01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:08.000
I'm not going to stand
for this sort of thing
any longer.

1054
01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:09.720
And therefore...

1055
01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:12.240
And therefore...

1056
01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:16.040
I am about
to raise your salary!

1057
01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:23.360
(laughs)

1058
01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:26.080
A merry Christmas
to you, Bob.

1059
01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:31.480
A merrier Christmas,
Bob, my good fellow,

1060
01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:34.120
than I've given you
in many a year.

1061
01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:38.280
I'll raise your salary,
and do whatever I can to
help your struggling family.

1062
01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.400
And we'll discuss
your affairs

1063
01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:43.360
this very afternoon over
a bowl of Christmas punch.

1064
01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:45.280
But first,
let's make up
the fires.

1065
01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:48.280
I want you to go out...

1066
01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:51.280
And buy another
scuttle of coal

1067
01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:53.600
before you
dot another "I",
Bob Cratchit.

1068
01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:56.760
Off with you, Bob.

1069
01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:58.960
We've wassailing to do.

1070
01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:01.440
Hilly-ho, Bob!

1071
01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:04.320
Yeah. Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.

1072
01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:05.720
(Scrooge laughs)

1073
01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:07.640
(♪ chorus in distance singing

1079
01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:28.400
And Scrooge was better
than his word.

1080
01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:31.240
He did all that
he said he would
and more.

1081
01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:34.720
And to our Tiny Tim,
who got well,

1082
01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:37.320
Scrooge was like
a second father.

1083
01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:40.160
He became as good a friend
as good a master

1084
01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:43.880
and as good a man
as the good old city
ever knew.

1085
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.320
And it was always said
of him that he knew
how to keep Christmas well.

1086
01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:53.200
And so,
as Tiny Tim observed...

1087
01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:56.000
God bless us,
everyone.
