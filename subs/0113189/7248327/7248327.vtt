1
00:03:06.545 --> 00:03:08.337
Beg your pardon. Forgot to knock.

2
00:03:52.674 --> 00:03:55.676
<i>Ni odnoho vyzdoha. Gdye vashy?</i>

3
00:03:56.512 --> 00:03:57.845
I'm alone.

4
00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:03.893
Aren't we all?

5
00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:08.564
- You're late, 007.
- I had to stop in the bathroom.

6
00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:12.527
- Ready to save the world again?
- After you, 006.

7
00:04:17.074 --> 00:04:22.036
- James... For England.
- For England, Alec.

8
00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:10.042
- It's too easy.
- Half of everything is luck, James.

9
00:05:10.836 --> 00:05:12.879
And the other half?

10
00:05:14.923 --> 00:05:16.591
Fate.

11
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.177
- Set timers: six minutes.
- Six minutes. Check.

12
00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:49.457
Fire.

13
00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.087
- Closing time, James. Last call.
- Buy me a pint.

14
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.691
This is Colonel Ourumov.
Come out with your hands up.

15
00:06:15.776 --> 00:06:17.360
How original.

16
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.200
Shut the door, Alec. There's a draught.

17
00:06:26.995 --> 00:06:29.080
Alec?

18
00:06:41.802 --> 00:06:45.554
Move out. Throw down your weapon
and walk towards me, slowly.

19
00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:49.475
- Finish the job, James. Blow them to hell.
- You have ten seconds.

20
00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:53.270
Ten,

21
00:06:54.064 --> 00:06:56.565
nine, eight,

22
00:06:57.484 --> 00:06:59.735
seven, six,

23
00:07:01.071 --> 00:07:03.489
five, four,

24
00:07:03.782 --> 00:07:06.158
- three, two...
- For England, James.

25
00:07:09.121 --> 00:07:12.289
Hold your fire. You'll blow the gas tanks.

26
00:07:14.334 --> 00:07:17.169
This is your last chance.
Come out with your hands...

27
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.135
Wait.

28
00:08:05.761 --> 00:08:06.927
You can't win.

29
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.117
Get out there. Move. Move it.

30
00:08:44.674 --> 00:08:46.258
Hold your fire.

31
00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:23.963
Wait.

32
00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.724
- James, is it necessary to drive so fast?
- More often than you'd think.

33
00:13:55.902 --> 00:13:59.738
I enjoy a spirited ride
as much as the next girl, but...

34
00:14:03.576 --> 00:14:06.370
- Who's that?
- The next girl.

35
00:15:10.727 --> 00:15:13.020
James, stop this. Stop it.

36
00:15:13.563 --> 00:15:16.356
- I know what you're doing.
- What's that, dear?

37
00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:19.693
You are just trying to show off
the size of your...

38
00:15:19.861 --> 00:15:21.862
- Engine?
- Ego.

39
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.824
We're having a pleasant drive
and you bring psychology into it.

40
00:15:25.992 --> 00:15:30.370
- I was just sent here to evaluate you.
- Let's put that behind us, shall we?

41
00:16:06.616 --> 00:16:08.992
Ladies first.

42
00:16:23.883 --> 00:16:25.801
James, I want you to stop this car.

43
00:16:25.885 --> 00:16:28.428
- Really?
- Stop this car at once.

44
00:16:36.229 --> 00:16:40.023
As you can see, I have no problem
with female authority.

45
00:16:46.322 --> 00:16:49.241
James, you're incorrigible.

46
00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:52.244
What am I going to do with you?

47
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.664
Let's toast your evaluation, shall we?

48
00:17:01.045 --> 00:17:04.131
A very thorough evaluation.

49
00:17:27.071 --> 00:17:30.073
<i>Bonsoir, Monsieur Bond.
Très heureux de vous revoir.</i>

50
00:17:30.158 --> 00:17:34.453
<i>-Bonsoir, Pierre. Ça va bien?
- Très bien. Et vous?</i>

51
00:17:55.183 --> 00:17:57.267
<i>Sept à la banque.</i>

52
00:17:58.478 --> 00:18:00.604
Madame wins.

53
00:18:07.403 --> 00:18:09.988
Bet, mademoiselle? Non?

54
00:18:10.865 --> 00:18:12.616
Monsieur.

55
00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.785
Bets, ladies and gentlemen?

56
00:18:15.662 --> 00:18:17.496
<i>-No players?
- Banco.</i>

57
00:18:32.512 --> 00:18:35.430
It appears we share the same passions.

58
00:18:35.848 --> 00:18:37.391
Three, anyway.

59
00:18:37.642 --> 00:18:42.145
I count two -motoring and baccarat.

60
00:18:44.107 --> 00:18:46.191
<i>Huit, pour la banque.</i>

61
00:18:48.569 --> 00:18:50.862
Seven. Madame wins.

62
00:18:50.947 --> 00:18:54.783
I hope the third
is where your real talent lies.

63
00:18:55.493 --> 00:18:57.077
One rises to meet a challenge.

64
00:19:00.373 --> 00:19:01.540
<i>Double.</i>

65
00:19:02.792 --> 00:19:04.876
<i>Suivez.</i>

66
00:19:17.181 --> 00:19:18.557
<i>Carte.</i>

67
00:19:34.782 --> 00:19:36.533
Madame stands with five.

68
00:19:40.747 --> 00:19:43.957
<i>-Six. Madame loses.
- Buliatch.</i>

69
00:19:46.335 --> 00:19:50.505
- Enjoy it while it lasts.
- The very words I live by.

70
00:19:56.345 --> 00:19:58.972
And what words do you live by?

71
00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:04.186
- The trick is to quit while you're ahead.
- That's one trick I've never learned.

72
00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:06.563
Perhaps you'll show me how it's done.

73
00:20:07.565 --> 00:20:10.358
Vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred.

74
00:20:10.443 --> 00:20:12.527
And for you?

75
00:20:12.987 --> 00:20:14.780
The same.

76
00:20:14.864 --> 00:20:16.948
How do you take it?

77
00:20:17.784 --> 00:20:20.285
Straight up, with a twist.

78
00:20:22.997 --> 00:20:24.873
Thank you, Mr...

79
00:20:25.041 --> 00:20:28.126
The name's Bond. James Bond.

80
00:20:28.795 --> 00:20:30.712
Xenia Zaragevna Onatopp.

81
00:20:32.381 --> 00:20:34.925
- Onatopp?
- Onatopp.

82
00:20:36.344 --> 00:20:39.971
- Your accent... Georgian?
- Very good, Mr. Bond.

83
00:20:40.473 --> 00:20:42.057
- You've been to Russia.
- Not recently.

84
00:20:42.475 --> 00:20:45.435
I used to drop in occasionally.
Shoot in and out.

85
00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:50.232
It's very different now.
A land of opportunity.

86
00:20:51.192 --> 00:20:53.985
With a new Ferrari in every garage?

87
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:57.489
No, not quite. That belongs to a friend.

88
00:20:57.615 --> 00:21:03.328
A tip for your friend: the French number
plates for this year's model start with "L".

89
00:21:03.579 --> 00:21:04.996
Even the counterfeit ones.

90
00:21:07.291 --> 00:21:13.421
And what rank do you hold with
the motor vehicles department, Mr. Bond?

91
00:21:13.506 --> 00:21:14.965
Commander.

92
00:21:15.341 --> 00:21:17.425
Shall we go?

93
00:21:17.927 --> 00:21:20.470
This one is an admiral.

94
00:21:20.847 --> 00:21:23.014
I like a woman who enjoys pulling rank.

95
00:21:23.933 --> 00:21:26.643
Nice to meet you, Mr. Bond.

96
00:21:27.311 --> 00:21:29.813
The pleasure, I'm sure, was all mine.

97
00:22:57.151 --> 00:22:59.277
<i>Transmission begins from Moneypenny.</i>

98
00:22:59.362 --> 00:23:04.199
<i>ldentification confirmed:
Onatopp, Xenia. Ex-Soviet fighter pilot.</i>

99
00:23:04.283 --> 00:23:08.161
<i>Current suspected links to the Janus
crime syndicate, St. Petersburg.</i>

100
00:23:08.245 --> 00:23:11.957
<i>Yacht "Manticore" is leased
to a known Janus corporate front.</i>

101
00:23:12.208 --> 00:23:14.459
<i>M authorises you
to observe Miss Onatopp,</i>

102
00:23:14.543 --> 00:23:19.047
<i>but stipulates no contact
without prior approval.</i>

103
00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:21.383
<i>End of transmission. Moneypenny.</i>

104
00:23:21.676 --> 00:23:25.887
<i>Good night, James. I trust
you'll stay "onatopp" of things.</i>

105
00:23:41.862 --> 00:23:43.822
<i>Lyubeemyets.</i>

106
00:24:08.014 --> 00:24:11.641
Xenia, I can't breathe.

107
00:24:21.694 --> 00:24:23.028
Yes! Yes!

108
00:25:20.127 --> 00:25:21.669
<i>Merci, mon amiral.</i>

109
00:25:30.304 --> 00:25:32.388
My respects, Admiral.

110
00:25:35.893 --> 00:25:38.269
Delighted to have you aboard,
mademoiselle.

111
00:25:40.272 --> 00:25:42.816
Ladies and gentlemen,

112
00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:47.278
please take your seats
for the demonstration of the aircraft.

113
00:26:20.604 --> 00:26:25.316
What you are about to see is Europe's
answer to the electronic battlefield:

114
00:26:25.401 --> 00:26:29.028
the first working prototype
of the Tiger helicopter.

115
00:26:29.113 --> 00:26:32.866
Uniquely manoeuvrable, the Tiger
not only uses Stealth technology,

116
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:37.162
it is hardened against all forms
of electronic interference,

117
00:26:37.246 --> 00:26:40.081
radio jamming
and electromagnetic radiation.

118
00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:53.219
I have a small surprise from
your friends at the barracks.

119
00:26:53.304 --> 00:26:55.346
I think I've gone to heaven.

120
00:26:55.431 --> 00:26:57.140
Not yet.

121
00:27:05.524 --> 00:27:08.234
Please welcome the pilots.

122
00:27:10.988 --> 00:27:15.325
Lieutenant Commander Bernard Jaubert
and Lieutenant François Brouse.

123
00:28:22.434 --> 00:28:25.019
Select Mir.

124
00:28:25.271 --> 00:28:28.022
Orthographic projection.

125
00:28:29.817 --> 00:28:33.987
Compute possible intercept
with second-stage geo-sat two.

126
00:28:41.829 --> 00:28:42.870
Anna.

127
00:28:46.125 --> 00:28:49.544
He wouldn't know a woman
if one came up and sat on his head.

128
00:28:52.548 --> 00:28:54.632
Boris.

129
00:28:56.343 --> 00:28:58.469
What?

130
00:28:59.888 --> 00:29:02.348
I thought I'd post it
on the Internet, no?

131
00:29:02.725 --> 00:29:05.810
- What's the password?
- I made it easy this time.

132
00:29:06.145 --> 00:29:09.564
Even you should be able to break it,
borscht-for-brains.

133
00:29:10.899 --> 00:29:13.860
All right. All right. I'll give you a hint.

134
00:29:14.153 --> 00:29:19.699
They're right in front of you
and can open very large doors.

135
00:29:21.285 --> 00:29:23.328
You're such a geek.

136
00:29:24.496 --> 00:29:25.997
Yes. I'm in.

137
00:29:33.464 --> 00:29:35.757
You've hacked into
the US Department of Justice.

138
00:29:36.008 --> 00:29:37.842
What if they trace it here?

139
00:29:38.135 --> 00:29:42.055
The chief of computers will call me
a genius, move me to Moscow

140
00:29:42.139 --> 00:29:45.683
and give me a million bucks
hard currency.

141
00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:48.728
I think not.

142
00:29:48.812 --> 00:29:52.899
Besides, the Americans are slug-heads.
They'll never detect me.

143
00:29:54.193 --> 00:29:56.903
You were saying, slug-head?

144
00:29:56.987 --> 00:30:00.073
Nobody screws with Boris Grishenko.

145
00:30:01.992 --> 00:30:05.036
- Spiked them.
- Come on, Boris. Just hang up.

146
00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.038
No way. I spiked them.

147
00:30:10.376 --> 00:30:14.462
- All right. What's the password?
- I'm not going to tell you.

148
00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:17.298
OK. Let me guess.

149
00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.385
It's not in front of me?

150
00:30:20.469 --> 00:30:24.055
You sit on it,
but you can't take it with you.

151
00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.313
My program seizes the phone line
of whoever's tracing me

152
00:30:32.398 --> 00:30:35.733
and jams their modem
so they can't hang up.

153
00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.737
Now the hunted becomes the hunter.

154
00:30:43.534 --> 00:30:46.244
"Better luck next time,

155
00:30:46.328 --> 00:30:48.162
"slug-heads."

156
00:30:48.997 --> 00:30:52.625
Bang. Gone. I am invincible.

157
00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.633
Was it good for you, too?

158
00:31:00.717 --> 00:31:03.302
I'm getting some coffee.

159
00:31:03.595 --> 00:31:05.513
I'm going for a cigarette.

160
00:32:10.329 --> 00:32:14.874
General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov,
head of Space Division.

161
00:32:26.678 --> 00:32:29.055
- General, if I'd known...
- You'd have been ready.

162
00:32:29.139 --> 00:32:33.351
This is an unscheduled test
of Severnaya, Major. War simulation.

163
00:32:33.769 --> 00:32:36.771
We are going to test-fire GoldenEye.
Report your status.

164
00:32:37.147 --> 00:32:42.610
Two operational satellites, sir, Petya and
Mischa, in 90-minute earth orbit at 1 00km.

165
00:32:42.694 --> 00:32:44.278
Good.

166
00:32:44.696 --> 00:32:46.447
Here is the authorisation code.

167
00:32:46.865 --> 00:32:50.952
Now, the GoldenEye and today's access
numbers for satellite Petya, please.

168
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:54.038
I am timing you.

169
00:33:25.112 --> 00:33:27.738
Good. Thank you, Major.

170
00:34:05.569 --> 00:34:06.944
On my count.

171
00:34:07.279 --> 00:34:10.448
Three, two, one...

172
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:21.292
Set target. Severnaya.

173
00:34:32.304 --> 00:34:34.972
Arm the weapon.

174
00:34:59.581 --> 00:35:01.582
Check it.

175
00:35:12.427 --> 00:35:16.389
Their best response time
is 19 minutes. They'll be late.

176
00:35:51.007 --> 00:35:54.301
It's clean. I had to ventilate someone.

177
00:36:31.006 --> 00:36:33.841
- Good evening, Moneypenny.
- Good evening, James.

178
00:36:34.259 --> 00:36:37.511
M will meet you in the Situation Room.
I'm to take you in.

179
00:36:37.596 --> 00:36:40.848
- Never seen you after hours. Lovely.
- Thank you, James.

180
00:36:40.932 --> 00:36:44.602
Out on some kind of assignment?
Dressing to kill?

181
00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:47.271
I know you'll find this crushing, 007,

182
00:36:47.439 --> 00:36:51.150
but I don't sit at home
praying for an international incident

183
00:36:51.276 --> 00:36:54.612
so I can run down here
all dressed up to impress James Bond.

184
00:36:54.946 --> 00:36:58.616
I was on a date with a gentleman.
We went to the theatre.

185
00:36:58.742 --> 00:37:01.118
Moneypenny, I'm devastated.

186
00:37:01.244 --> 00:37:03.537
What would I ever do without you?

187
00:37:03.622 --> 00:37:07.792
As far as I can remember, James,
you've never had me.

188
00:37:10.754 --> 00:37:13.297
Hope springs eternal.

189
00:37:13.423 --> 00:37:17.092
This sort of behaviour
could qualify as sexual harassment.

190
00:37:17.177 --> 00:37:20.638
Really? What's the penalty for that?

191
00:37:20.764 --> 00:37:23.849
Someday you have to make good
on your innuendoes.

192
00:37:27.813 --> 00:37:32.441
- After you, Moneypenny.
- No, I insist. You first.

193
00:37:37.155 --> 00:37:40.241
- Good evening, 007.
- Tanner. What's up?

194
00:37:40.325 --> 00:37:42.993
16 minutes ago,
we intercepted a distress call

195
00:37:43.078 --> 00:37:47.081
from a supposedly abandoned
radar station at Severnaya. Look.

196
00:37:51.086 --> 00:37:56.841
- We found a match. Your missing Tiger.
- In the middle of northern Russia?

197
00:37:57.008 --> 00:38:01.345
Your hunch was right. Too bad the evil
queen of numbers wouldn't let you play it.

198
00:38:06.351 --> 00:38:09.228
- You were saying?
- No, no. I was just... just...

199
00:38:09.312 --> 00:38:13.774
Good. Because if I want sarcasm, I'll
talk to my children, thank you very much.

200
00:38:15.443 --> 00:38:17.528
- Good evening, 007.
- Good evening, M.

201
00:38:17.696 --> 00:38:20.990
The prime minister's
waiting for an update.

202
00:38:21.074 --> 00:38:23.951
Proceed with your briefing, Mr. Tanner.

203
00:38:24.035 --> 00:38:26.203
Thank you.

204
00:38:26.496 --> 00:38:30.249
Yes, after the distress signal,
your helicopter took off

205
00:38:30.375 --> 00:38:32.960
and the Russians
had three MiGs intercept it.

206
00:38:33.044 --> 00:38:35.629
What do you think the base is used for?

207
00:38:35.714 --> 00:38:38.465
We suspected it might be
the ground station

208
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:42.469
for a secret space-based
weapon called GoldenEye, but...

209
00:38:42.554 --> 00:38:47.516
Our statistical analysis saw they had
neither the finance nor technology.

210
00:38:47.684 --> 00:38:49.184
Numbers were never my strong suit.

211
00:38:51.187 --> 00:38:53.230
Are these pictures live?

212
00:38:53.356 --> 00:38:56.984
Unlike the American government, we
prefer not to get our bad news from CNN.

213
00:39:20.592 --> 00:39:23.260
<i>Negative so far.
Everything seems normal.</i>

214
00:40:26.866 --> 00:40:28.158
What the bloody hell was that?

215
00:41:55.371 --> 00:41:57.414
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.

216
00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.495
Boris. Boris.

217
00:43:19.831 --> 00:43:21.165
Thanks.

218
00:43:21.249 --> 00:43:25.669
Our satellite is knocked out.
So are two of the Americans'.

219
00:43:26.671 --> 00:43:31.341
We have another, coming into range now.

220
00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:37.222
Good God.

221
00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:40.601
Two of the MiGs are down.

222
00:43:40.685 --> 00:43:43.103
It looks like the third went into the dish.

223
00:43:43.354 --> 00:43:45.397
What do you think?

224
00:43:45.523 --> 00:43:50.360
No lights. Not one single
electric light on in a 30-mile radius.

225
00:43:51.779 --> 00:43:54.615
- EMP?
- It would explain the MiGs and satellites.

226
00:43:54.741 --> 00:43:57.409
- And the blackout.
- Electromagnetic pulse.

227
00:43:57.535 --> 00:44:02.581
- A satellite weapon developed by the...
- Americans and Soviets in the Cold War.

228
00:44:02.707 --> 00:44:04.583
I've read the brief.

229
00:44:04.667 --> 00:44:09.338
Discovered after Hiroshima. Set off
a nuclear device in the upper atmosphere.

230
00:44:09.505 --> 00:44:14.509
Creates a pulse, a radiation surge,
that destroys everything electronic.

231
00:44:14.886 --> 00:44:19.890
The idea being to knock out the enemy's
communications before they can retaliate.

232
00:44:21.059 --> 00:44:23.477
So, GoldenEye exists.

233
00:44:24.604 --> 00:44:25.687
Yes.

234
00:44:26.522 --> 00:44:29.441
- Could this be an accident?
- No. The helicopter.

235
00:44:30.026 --> 00:44:33.237
For stealing the GoldenEye,
it was the perfect getaway vehicle.

236
00:44:33.321 --> 00:44:36.698
Setting off the blast would
wipe out any trace of the crime.

237
00:44:37.075 --> 00:44:41.411
- The Janus group?
- It may be linked to the helicopter.

238
00:44:42.413 --> 00:44:44.498
I know the Russian fail-safe systems.

239
00:44:44.582 --> 00:44:49.753
You just don't walk in and ask for the keys
to the bomb. You need the access codes.

240
00:44:57.011 --> 00:44:59.137
There had to be an insider.

241
00:45:07.272 --> 00:45:09.856
At least one person
probably knows who it is.

242
00:45:31.629 --> 00:45:35.132
Very well, sir. Thank you. Good night.

243
00:45:36.801 --> 00:45:41.722
The prime minister's talked to Moscow. It
was "an accident on a training exercise".

244
00:45:41.806 --> 00:45:44.975
Governments change.
The lies stay the same.

245
00:45:45.101 --> 00:45:47.060
What else do we know about Janus?

246
00:45:47.145 --> 00:45:50.397
Top-flight arms dealers,
headquartered in St. Petersburg.

247
00:45:50.481 --> 00:45:53.442
Restocked the Iraqis during the Gulf War.

248
00:45:53.568 --> 00:45:56.945
The head man's unreliably
described. No photographs.

249
00:45:57.030 --> 00:46:02.409
The woman, Onatopp,
is our only confirmed contact.

250
00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:06.330
- Would you care for a drink?
- Thank you.

251
00:46:06.622 --> 00:46:10.125
- Your predecessor kept some cognac...
- I prefer bourbon.

252
00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:12.085
- Ice?
- Yes.

253
00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:25.891
We pulled the files on whoever may have
had access or authority at Severnaya.

254
00:46:26.017 --> 00:46:30.020
The top name on the list's
an old friend of yours, I understand.

255
00:46:33.232 --> 00:46:36.360
Ourumov. They made him a general.

256
00:46:36.486 --> 00:46:39.446
He sees himself as the next
"iron man of Russia".

257
00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:43.367
Our political analysts say
he doesn't fit the profile of a traitor.

258
00:46:43.451 --> 00:46:47.454
Are these the same analysts who said
that GoldenEye couldn't exist?

259
00:46:47.538 --> 00:46:52.542
Who said the helicopter posed no threat
and wasn't worth following?

260
00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.797
You don't like me, Bond.
You don't like my methods.

261
00:46:56.881 --> 00:47:01.802
You think I'm an accountant, more
interested in numbers than your instincts.

262
00:47:02.053 --> 00:47:04.429
- The thought had occurred to me.
- Good.

263
00:47:04.555 --> 00:47:07.641
Because I think you're
a sexist, misogynist dinosaur,

264
00:47:07.725 --> 00:47:11.812
a relic of the Cold War, whose
boyish charms, though wasted on me,

265
00:47:11.896 --> 00:47:15.607
obviously appealed to that young woman
I sent out to evaluate you.

266
00:47:15.733 --> 00:47:18.860
- Point taken.
- Not quite, 007.

267
00:47:19.404 --> 00:47:22.697
If you think I don't have the balls
to send a man out to die,

268
00:47:22.782 --> 00:47:25.283
your instincts are dead wrong.

269
00:47:25.368 --> 00:47:28.286
I've no compunction
about sending you to your death.

270
00:47:28.413 --> 00:47:34.126
But I won't do it on a whim, even
with your cavalier attitude towards life.

271
00:47:36.587 --> 00:47:38.505
I want you to find GoldenEye.

272
00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:41.967
Find who took it, what they plan
to do with it, and stop it.

273
00:47:42.218 --> 00:47:44.719
If you come across Ourumov,
guilty or not,

274
00:47:44.804 --> 00:47:50.058
don't run off on a vendetta. Avenging
Alec Trevelyan will not bring him back.

275
00:47:50.143 --> 00:47:54.688
- You didn't get him killed.
- Neither did you. Don't make it personal.

276
00:47:55.815 --> 00:47:57.732
Never.

277
00:48:01.279 --> 00:48:03.321
Bond...

278
00:48:05.658 --> 00:48:07.784
Come back alive.

279
00:48:47.825 --> 00:48:50.702
Good morning, General Ourumov.

280
00:48:52.205 --> 00:48:54.414
Defence Minister Mishkin... Gentlemen.

281
00:48:55.291 --> 00:48:58.043
Please, deliver your report.

282
00:49:00.963 --> 00:49:06.092
As you know, 72 hours ago, a secret
weapons system -codename GoldenEye-

283
00:49:06.177 --> 00:49:08.136
was detonated over Severnaya.

284
00:49:08.221 --> 00:49:12.849
As head of Space Division,
I personally undertook the investigation.

285
00:49:12.934 --> 00:49:17.312
I have concluded this crime was
committed by Siberian separatists

286
00:49:17.396 --> 00:49:20.023
seeking to create political unrest.

287
00:49:21.317 --> 00:49:25.779
Regrettably, the peaceful work and the
hard-currency earnings of Severnaya

288
00:49:25.863 --> 00:49:28.782
have been set back by several years.

289
00:49:28.866 --> 00:49:30.784
Therefore, I tender my resignation.

290
00:49:33.871 --> 00:49:37.499
It seems the council does not want
your head, Arkady Grigorovich.

291
00:49:37.583 --> 00:49:41.127
Merely your assurance that
there are no other GoldenEyes.

292
00:49:41.212 --> 00:49:43.880
I can give you that assurance,
Defence Minister.

293
00:49:43.965 --> 00:49:46.383
And what of the two missing
Severnaya technicians?

294
00:49:49.929 --> 00:49:53.848
I was aware only of the one.
Boris Grishenko.

295
00:49:53.933 --> 00:49:56.810
There was a girl also, whose body
was not among the dead.

296
00:49:56.894 --> 00:50:00.063
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.
A level-two programmer.

297
00:50:00.439 --> 00:50:02.899
I will investigate immediately.

298
00:50:03.484 --> 00:50:08.488
It would seem presumptuous to blame
this incident on Siberian separatists

299
00:50:08.573 --> 00:50:13.034
before the whereabouts
of your own people are determined.

300
00:50:13.578 --> 00:50:17.247
- Do you agree?
- Yes, Defence Minister.

301
00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:21.001
Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

302
00:50:22.378 --> 00:50:24.462
That will be all.

303
00:50:38.185 --> 00:50:41.646
Morning, Q. Sorry about the leg. Skiing?

304
00:50:44.442 --> 00:50:45.609
Hunting.

305
00:50:46.819 --> 00:50:49.321
Right. Now pay attention, 007.

306
00:50:49.488 --> 00:50:51.531
First, your new car.

307
00:50:51.616 --> 00:50:56.036
BMW. Agile, five forward gears,
all-points radar.

308
00:50:56.579 --> 00:51:01.875
Self-destruct system. And, naturally,
all the usual refinements.

309
00:51:01.959 --> 00:51:05.587
Now, this I'm particularly proud of.

310
00:51:05.671 --> 00:51:08.590
Behind the headlights, Stinger missiles.

311
00:51:08.674 --> 00:51:12.218
Excellent. Just the thing
for unwinding after a rough day.

312
00:51:12.303 --> 00:51:19.309
Need I remind you, 007, that you have
a licence to kill, not break the traffic laws.

313
00:51:20.102 --> 00:51:22.145
- I wouldn't think of it.
- Good.

314
00:51:22.271 --> 00:51:24.522
Right. Let's get on
to more practical matters.

315
00:51:25.483 --> 00:51:31.196
A typical leather belt.
Male, size 34, buckle, notch.

316
00:51:34.075 --> 00:51:35.784
Have you finished?

317
00:51:35.868 --> 00:51:37.202
- Yes.
- Good.

318
00:51:37.328 --> 00:51:40.246
- A typical belt...
- Q, I'm familiar with that device.

319
00:51:40.498 --> 00:51:44.918
Not one with a 75-foot
rappelling cord built into the buckle.

320
00:51:45.002 --> 00:51:48.129
Fire, and out shoots a piton,

321
00:51:48.339 --> 00:51:52.092
followed by a high-tensile wire
designed to support your weight.

322
00:51:52.176 --> 00:51:55.553
I see. And what if I need
additional support?

323
00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:58.014
It's tested for one, 007.

324
00:52:02.978 --> 00:52:06.064
Flight 878 to St. Petersburg.

325
00:52:07.858 --> 00:52:10.527
X-ray document scanner.

326
00:52:10.653 --> 00:52:13.905
A pen. This is a class 4 grenade.

327
00:52:14.115 --> 00:52:17.575
Three clicks arms the four-second fuse.

328
00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:20.578
Another three disarms it.

329
00:52:23.708 --> 00:52:26.000
How long did you say the fuse was?

330
00:52:26.502 --> 00:52:28.128
Grow up, 007.

331
00:52:28.212 --> 00:52:32.841
- "The pen is mightier than the sword."
- Thanks to me, it is.

332
00:52:33.092 --> 00:52:36.803
Look, let's ask Freddie here
to demonstrate for us.

333
00:52:36.887 --> 00:52:41.349
Here we are. Sorry about this, Fred.
One, two, three.

334
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:50.859
- Don't say it.
- The writing's on the wall?

335
00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:54.070
Along with the rest of him.

336
00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:57.615
Now, 007, do please try and return...

337
00:53:01.078 --> 00:53:04.539
Do try and return some of this
equipment in pristine order.

338
00:53:04.623 --> 00:53:06.624
Don't touch that. That's my lunch.

339
00:53:33.736 --> 00:53:35.779
In London, April's a spring month.

340
00:53:35.905 --> 00:53:38.907
Oh, yeah? What are you -
the weatherman?

341
00:53:38.991 --> 00:53:41.701
For cryin' out loud.
Another stiff-assed Brit,

342
00:53:41.786 --> 00:53:44.537
with your secret codes and passwords.

343
00:53:44.622 --> 00:53:47.707
One of these days you guys
are gonna learn just to drop it.

344
00:53:47.792 --> 00:53:50.460
Come on. My car's over there.

345
00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:07.769
- After you.
- Thank you.

346
00:54:10.147 --> 00:54:12.315
- Like you said, drop it.
- All right.

347
00:54:12.441 --> 00:54:16.611
In London, April's a spring month.
In St. Petersburg, we freeze our butts off.

348
00:54:16.695 --> 00:54:19.614
- Close enough for government work?
- No.

349
00:54:20.658 --> 00:54:23.827
- Show me the rose.
- Please, no.

350
00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:26.454
All right, all right, all right.

351
00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:41.553
- "Muffy"?
- Third wife.

352
00:54:41.679 --> 00:54:45.390
- Jack Wade, CIA.
- James Bond, stiff-assed Brit.

353
00:54:45.516 --> 00:54:47.559
- That's a nice move.
- Nice car.

354
00:54:47.685 --> 00:54:51.688
Hasn't let me down yet. She's an ugly
little bitch, but she gets you there.

355
00:54:51.814 --> 00:54:54.399
Hey, Bond. Do you do any gardening?

356
00:54:59.697 --> 00:55:05.201
<i>St. Petersburg express
has now arrived at Platform 3.</i>

357
00:55:11.375 --> 00:55:13.418
Can you hand me that wrench, Jimmy?

358
00:55:14.545 --> 00:55:17.714
- So what do you know about Janus?
- Zilch. Zipsky.

359
00:55:17.923 --> 00:55:21.426
No one's ever seen him.
But the man's connected up the kazoo.

360
00:55:21.552 --> 00:55:24.053
KGB, military. Screwdriver.

361
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:30.226
Rumour has it he lives on
one of those old Soviet missile trains.

362
00:55:30.352 --> 00:55:34.439
That armoured stuff they used to
run around so we couldn't target 'em.

363
00:55:34.773 --> 00:55:37.901
Wanna hand me that hammer, Jimbo?

364
00:55:38.027 --> 00:55:40.445
No, the bigger one. The sledge.

365
00:55:40.571 --> 00:55:44.866
Anyways, to tell the truth,
you don't find this guy. He finds you.

366
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:47.869
Hell, it's all Russian Mafia.

367
00:55:48.078 --> 00:55:52.749
Best thing I can do is point you
in the direction of his competition.

368
00:55:55.961 --> 00:55:59.505
- Who is the competition?
- An ex-KGB guy. Tough mother.

369
00:55:59.590 --> 00:56:02.258
Limps on his right leg. Name's Zukovsky.

370
00:56:02.426 --> 00:56:04.844
- Valentin Dimitreveych Zukovsky?
- Yeah.

371
00:56:04.929 --> 00:56:07.764
- You know him?
- I gave him the limp.

372
00:56:32.623 --> 00:56:34.749
Yes?

373
00:56:34.917 --> 00:56:39.170
- Are these all you have?
- How many do you want?

374
00:56:40.297 --> 00:56:43.174
24 for the American school,
11 for the Swedish.

375
00:56:43.258 --> 00:56:48.638
IBM-compatible with 500 meg
hard drives, CD-ROM and 14.4 modems.

376
00:56:49.807 --> 00:56:51.975
- You pay dollars?
- Of course.

377
00:56:52.101 --> 00:56:54.227
If madam requires a demonstration...

378
00:56:54.311 --> 00:56:59.315
Madam requires one demonstration
model and a quiet place to test it.

379
00:57:13.163 --> 00:57:14.330
Natalya.

380
00:57:30.889 --> 00:57:35.518
- Is everything satisfactory?
- Everything except the interruption.

381
00:57:47.948 --> 00:57:49.949
<i>Let me get this straight, Jimmy.</i>

382
00:57:50.034 --> 00:57:53.870
<i>You shot him in the Ieg,
you stole his car, you took his girl.</i>

383
00:57:54.121 --> 00:57:57.040
<i>And now you want Zukovsky
to set you up with Janus?</i>

384
00:57:57.374 --> 00:58:00.626
- Yes.
- Are you gonna appeal to his heart?

385
00:58:00.711 --> 00:58:03.880
- No. His wallet.
- That might work.

386
00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:06.340
OK. Showtime.

387
00:58:11.722 --> 00:58:14.599
Valentin operates
out of building number 23.

388
00:58:14.975 --> 00:58:16.809
Are you sure you wanna do this?

389
00:58:16.894 --> 00:58:22.231
Last guy who dropped in uninvited went
home air freight -in very small boxes.

390
00:58:23.108 --> 00:58:26.235
Make sure they send me home first class.

391
00:59:20.165 --> 00:59:24.794
Natalya. It's me. It's Boris.
It's Boris. It's Boris. Hello.

392
00:59:30.467 --> 00:59:33.302
Another morning shot to hell.

393
00:59:34.847 --> 00:59:39.225
Free-market economy!
I swear it will be the end of me.

394
00:59:43.564 --> 00:59:46.983
Walther PPK, 7.65mm.

395
00:59:47.067 --> 00:59:52.280
Only three men I know use such a gun.
I believe I've killed two of them.

396
00:59:52.364 --> 00:59:56.242
- Lucky me.
- I think not.

397
00:59:56.743 --> 00:59:59.745
<i>Ooh-ahh</i>

398
00:59:59.997 --> 01:00:02.582
<i>And if you Iove him</i>

399
01:00:02.666 --> 01:00:03.833
<i>Love him</i>

400
01:00:03.917 --> 01:00:06.794
<i>Oh, be so proud of him</i>

401
01:00:06.879 --> 01:00:08.045
<i>Of him</i>

402
01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:10.840
<i>Cos after all</i>

403
01:00:10.924 --> 01:00:13.426
<i>He's just a man</i>

404
01:00:16.221 --> 01:00:18.639
<i>Stand by your man...</i>

405
01:00:21.768 --> 01:00:23.853
James Bond.

406
01:00:24.688 --> 01:00:27.815
Charming, sophisticated secret agent.

407
01:00:28.817 --> 01:00:31.444
"Shaken, but not stirred."

408
01:00:32.446 --> 01:00:36.407
I see you haven't lost your
delicate sense of humour, Valentin.

409
01:00:36.658 --> 01:00:38.993
Or your need for an audience.

410
01:00:39.912 --> 01:00:43.539
- Who's strangling the cat?
- Strangling a cat?

411
01:00:43.624 --> 01:00:45.833
<i>Stand by your man</i>

412
01:00:49.588 --> 01:00:52.715
That is Irina, my mistress.

413
01:00:54.134 --> 01:00:56.636
Very talented girl.

414
01:00:56.803 --> 01:00:58.971
Irina. Take a hike.

415
01:01:03.852 --> 01:01:09.023
So, Mr. Bond, what is it that
brings you to my neighbourhood?

416
01:01:09.107 --> 01:01:14.779
Still working for MI6, or
have you joined the 21 st century?

417
01:01:14.863 --> 01:01:16.822
I hear the new M is a lady.

418
01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:20.243
I want you to do me a favour.

419
01:01:21.745 --> 01:01:25.581
He wants me to do him a favour.

420
01:01:26.291 --> 01:01:32.672
My knee aches every single day.
Twice as bad when it is cold.

421
01:01:33.048 --> 01:01:36.634
Have you any idea how long
the winter lasts in this country?

422
01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.970
- Tell him, Dimitri.
- It depends...

423
01:01:39.054 --> 01:01:40.721
Silence.

424
01:01:40.806 --> 01:01:44.267
For an ex-KGB agent,
you surprise me, Valentin.

425
01:01:44.351 --> 01:01:49.146
Surely you must have realised the skill
was not to hit your knee, but to

426
01:01:49.231 --> 01:01:51.524
miss the rest of you.

427
01:01:52.526 --> 01:01:57.280
- So why did you not kill me?
- Call it professional courtesy.

428
01:01:58.198 --> 01:02:01.867
Then I should extend you
the same courtesy.

429
01:02:04.329 --> 01:02:08.457
Kirov's funeral parlour,
four o'clock this afternoon.

430
01:02:08.542 --> 01:02:11.794
200 pounds of C4 explosives
hidden in a casket.

431
01:02:11.878 --> 01:02:15.339
Your man drives the hearse in,
the money's exchanged,

432
01:02:15.424 --> 01:02:18.050
their man drives the hearse out.

433
01:02:18.135 --> 01:02:20.845
Their man will be arrested
with the explosives.

434
01:02:20.929 --> 01:02:24.849
Your man will make
a miraculous escape with the money.

435
01:02:24.933 --> 01:02:27.059
Your money.

436
01:02:27.144 --> 01:02:29.770
And what do I owe
for this accommodation?

437
01:02:30.105 --> 01:02:33.316
I want you to set me up with Janus.

438
01:02:33.984 --> 01:02:38.487
- What has he done to deserve you?
- Stole a helicopter.

439
01:02:38.572 --> 01:02:41.157
- I have six.
- Three. None that fly.

440
01:02:41.992 --> 01:02:45.328
- Who's counting?
- These aren't just criminals but traitors.

441
01:02:46.079 --> 01:02:51.167
They used the chopper to steal a nuclear
weapon. Killed a lot of innocent Russians.

442
01:02:51.251 --> 01:02:53.753
- What do you expect from a Cossack?
- Who?

443
01:02:55.088 --> 01:02:58.507
This Janus -I never met the man,
but I know he's a Lienz Cossack.

444
01:02:58.967 --> 01:03:02.053
The group that worked
for the Nazis, Second World War.

445
01:03:02.346 --> 01:03:04.889
You know your history.
At the end of the war,

446
01:03:04.973 --> 01:03:08.559
the Lienz Cossacks surrendered
to the British in Austria,

447
01:03:08.643 --> 01:03:13.105
believing they would join them
and wage war against the communists.

448
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:16.567
But the British betrayed them,
sent them back to Stalin,

449
01:03:16.651 --> 01:03:18.736
who promptly had them all shot.

450
01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:21.280
Women, children, families.

451
01:03:22.908 --> 01:03:25.868
Not exactly our finest hour.

452
01:03:26.036 --> 01:03:29.914
Still, ruthless people.
They got what they deserved.

453
01:03:29.998 --> 01:03:33.918
I want you to set me up with Janus.
Tell him I'm asking about the chopper.

454
01:03:34.044 --> 01:03:38.381
- You meet me tonight at the Grand Hotel.
- And then you and I are even and

455
01:03:38.507 --> 01:03:41.634
- he owes me one.
- Precisely.

456
01:04:44.406 --> 01:04:46.907
You don't need the gun, Commander.

457
01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:50.077
That depends on
your definition of safe sex.

458
01:04:56.001 --> 01:04:58.210
That's close enough.

459
01:04:58.295 --> 01:05:00.838
Not for what I have in mind.

460
01:05:24.613 --> 01:05:27.490
You think you can hurt me?

461
01:05:46.635 --> 01:05:48.928
You think you can break me?

462
01:05:57.437 --> 01:05:59.855
Yes! Yes! Yes!

463
01:06:06.363 --> 01:06:09.323
No, no, no.

464
01:06:09.783 --> 01:06:11.867
No more foreplay.

465
01:06:12.827 --> 01:06:14.620
Take me to Janus.

466
01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:15.704
<i>Buliatch.</i>

467
01:06:30.095 --> 01:06:32.555
- This is it?
- Yes.

468
01:06:34.224 --> 01:06:38.394
Well, I must say, I've had a lovely evening.

469
01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:42.398
- You?
- Once again, the pleasure was all yours.

470
01:06:42.482 --> 01:06:46.860
- You'll understand if I don't call.
- I won't lose sleep over it.

471
01:06:49.239 --> 01:06:51.282
Sweet dreams.

472
01:08:03.229 --> 01:08:05.314
Hello, James.

473
01:08:27.879 --> 01:08:31.340
- Alec?
- Back from the dead.

474
01:08:31.424 --> 01:08:34.677
No longer just an anonymous star
on the Memorial Wall at MI6.

475
01:08:36.012 --> 01:08:40.641
What's the matter, James?
No glib remark? No pithy comeback?

476
01:08:42.435 --> 01:08:44.520
Why?

477
01:08:45.313 --> 01:08:48.732
Hilarious question. Particularly from you.

478
01:08:49.401 --> 01:08:55.531
Did you ever ask why we toppled
all those dictators and regimes,

479
01:08:55.615 --> 01:08:59.076
only to come home - "Well done.
Good job, but sorry, old boy."

480
01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.995
"Everything you risked
your life for has changed."

481
01:09:02.497 --> 01:09:06.208
- It was the job we were chosen for.
- Of course you'd say that.

482
01:09:06.292 --> 01:09:12.214
James Bond, Her Majesty's loyal terrier,
defender of the so-called faith.

483
01:09:12.298 --> 01:09:14.675
Please, James, put it away.

484
01:09:15.385 --> 01:09:19.680
It's insulting to think
I haven't anticipated your every move.

485
01:09:21.099 --> 01:09:22.808
Yes.

486
01:09:24.644 --> 01:09:30.357
- I trusted you, Alec.
- Trust. What a quaint idea.

487
01:09:31.317 --> 01:09:35.487
How did the MI6 screening miss
that your parents were Lienz Cossacks?

488
01:09:35.572 --> 01:09:39.241
Once again, your faith
is misplaced. They knew.

489
01:09:39.325 --> 01:09:41.702
We're both orphans, James.

490
01:09:41.786 --> 01:09:46.039
But where your parents had the luxury
of dying in a climbing accident,

491
01:09:46.124 --> 01:09:50.794
mine survived the British betrayal
and Stalin's execution squads.

492
01:09:50.879 --> 01:09:56.300
But my father couldn't let himself
or my mother live with the shame of it.

493
01:09:56.384 --> 01:09:59.094
MI6 figured I was too young to remember.

494
01:09:59.763 --> 01:10:02.389
And in one of life's little ironies,

495
01:10:02.474 --> 01:10:05.768
the son went to work for
the government whose betrayal

496
01:10:05.852 --> 01:10:09.354
caused the father to kill
himself and his wife.

497
01:10:09.647 --> 01:10:15.027
Hence Janus, the two-faced
Roman god, come to life.

498
01:10:15.111 --> 01:10:18.071
It wasn't God who gave me this face.

499
01:10:18.156 --> 01:10:21.825
It was you, setting the timers
for three minutes instead of six.

500
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:27.164
- Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?
- No. You're supposed to die for me.

501
01:10:30.084 --> 01:10:32.294
By the way,

502
01:10:32.378 --> 01:10:37.549
I did think of asking you to join
my little scheme, but somehow I knew

503
01:10:37.634 --> 01:10:41.512
007's loyalty was always to the mission,

504
01:10:41.596 --> 01:10:43.680
never to his friend.

505
01:10:45.099 --> 01:10:47.601
Closing time, James. Last call.

506
01:11:03.451 --> 01:11:04.660
For England, James.

507
01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:07.996
Wake up. Mister.

508
01:11:09.833 --> 01:11:13.085
Wake up, please. Wake up.

509
01:11:13.169 --> 01:11:15.045
I'm here. I'm here.

510
01:11:15.171 --> 01:11:18.173
Hurry. Hurry up. Come on.

511
01:11:19.175 --> 01:11:21.051
Pull yourself together or we're gonna die.

512
01:11:24.722 --> 01:11:28.600
- Do something. Get us out of here.
- I'm a little tied up.

513
01:11:28.852 --> 01:11:30.060
Never mind.

514
01:12:49.098 --> 01:12:52.392
The things we do
for frequent-flier mileage.

515
01:12:53.770 --> 01:12:55.896
Here. Let me help you.

516
01:12:56.064 --> 01:12:58.690
That's it. Mind your head.

517
01:13:06.282 --> 01:13:08.492
Let me go.

518
01:13:52.495 --> 01:13:54.830
Who are you?

519
01:13:56.499 --> 01:13:59.668
- Listen. I'm on your side.
- I don't know anything.

520
01:13:59.752 --> 01:14:01.628
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

521
01:14:01.713 --> 01:14:04.006
Look, they might be back any minute.

522
01:14:04.257 --> 01:14:07.926
Are you with me, or your countrymen
who killed everyone at Severnaya?

523
01:14:08.011 --> 01:14:10.804
I've never been to Severnaya.

524
01:14:10.888 --> 01:14:14.224
Your watch has. Frozen
by the GoldenEye blast.

525
01:14:15.309 --> 01:14:20.355
And I'm willing to bet you're the one
who climbed up the dish to get out.

526
01:14:20.815 --> 01:14:23.233
- Who are you?
- I work for the British government.

527
01:14:23.317 --> 01:14:25.819
The more you tell me,
the more I can help you.

528
01:14:25.903 --> 01:14:30.073
- But I don't know anything.
- Then start with what you do know.

529
01:14:39.834 --> 01:14:42.544
My name is Natalya Simonova.

530
01:14:43.046 --> 01:14:46.798
I was a systems programmer
at Severnaya facility until...

531
01:14:46.883 --> 01:14:48.967
Go on.

532
01:14:50.219 --> 01:14:53.513
- ...until they killed everyone.
- Who? Alec Trevelyan?

533
01:14:53.598 --> 01:14:58.101
- No. I don't know who that is.
- Who's the insider? Who's the traitor?

534
01:14:58.186 --> 01:15:00.479
Boris. Boris Grishenko.

535
01:15:00.772 --> 01:15:04.524
- KGB or military?
- Computer programmer.

536
01:15:04.734 --> 01:15:07.861
- There was no one else?
- No.

537
01:15:09.822 --> 01:15:11.615
They're going to kill me, aren't they?

538
01:15:13.743 --> 01:15:14.826
Trust me.

539
01:15:17.455 --> 01:15:20.832
Trust you? I don't even know your name.

540
01:15:22.752 --> 01:15:25.921
Good morning, Mr. Bond. Sit.

541
01:15:33.054 --> 01:15:35.680
I am Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin.

542
01:15:35.765 --> 01:15:39.226
So, by what means shall we
execute you, Commander Bond?

543
01:15:39.602 --> 01:15:41.394
What, no small talk?

544
01:15:41.479 --> 01:15:43.605
No chitchat?

545
01:15:43.815 --> 01:15:48.318
That's the trouble. No one has time to do
a really sinister interrogation any more.

546
01:15:48.528 --> 01:15:52.322
- It's a lost art.
- Your sense of humour doesn't slay me.

547
01:15:52.657 --> 01:15:54.991
- Where is the GoldenEye?
- I assumed you had it.

548
01:15:55.201 --> 01:15:58.703
I have an English spy,
a programmer and a helicopter...

549
01:15:58.788 --> 01:16:02.207
- That's how your traitor wants it to look.
- Who attacked Severnaya?

550
01:16:02.291 --> 01:16:06.253
- Who had the codes?
- The penalty for terrorism is still death.

551
01:16:06.337 --> 01:16:10.507
- And for treason?
- Stop it, both of you. Stop it.

552
01:16:10.591 --> 01:16:13.093
You're like boys with toys.

553
01:16:18.099 --> 01:16:21.309
It was Ourumov.
General Ourumov set off the weapon.

554
01:16:21.769 --> 01:16:23.645
I saw him do it.

555
01:16:26.357 --> 01:16:29.776
- Are you certain it was Ourumov?
- Yes.

556
01:16:29.986 --> 01:16:33.989
He killed everyone,
then stole the GoldenEye.

557
01:16:34.532 --> 01:16:35.824
And why would he do that?

558
01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:39.744
There is another satellite.

559
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:45.083
Another GoldenEye.

560
01:16:45.877 --> 01:16:48.712
Thank you, Miss Simonova.

561
01:16:49.005 --> 01:16:52.507
What did you say about
the lost art of interrogation, Mr. Bond?

562
01:16:53.843 --> 01:16:58.096
Defence Minister, I must protest.
This is my investigation.

563
01:16:58.181 --> 01:17:01.349
- You are out of order.
- Molcheetye. Molcheech.

564
01:17:01.434 --> 01:17:05.437
From what I am hearing,
it is you who is out of order.

565
01:17:05.521 --> 01:17:07.898
I've seen this gun
in the hand of our enemy.

566
01:17:07.982 --> 01:17:12.277
- Put it down, General.
- Do you even know who the enemy is?

567
01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:14.029
- Do you?
- Guard.

568
01:17:20.286 --> 01:17:23.330
Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin,

569
01:17:24.498 --> 01:17:28.460
murdered by British agent James Bond,

570
01:17:31.088 --> 01:17:34.591
himself shot while trying to escape.

571
01:17:34.675 --> 01:17:36.092
Guards.

572
01:17:47.063 --> 01:17:48.730
Come on.

573
01:18:29.272 --> 01:18:30.480
They're in the archive.

574
01:18:35.611 --> 01:18:36.945
Down.

575
01:19:28.247 --> 01:19:31.249
Spread out. Cover the other side.

576
01:19:31.334 --> 01:19:33.418
Trust me.

577
01:20:09.622 --> 01:20:11.998
Go now.

578
01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:42.862
Faster.

579
01:21:03.717 --> 01:21:05.218
Damn it.

580
01:21:12.143 --> 01:21:14.477
Down the alley.

581
01:22:13.996 --> 01:22:15.997
Use the bumper. That's what it's for.

582
01:22:28.886 --> 01:22:30.303
<i>Nazad.</i>

583
01:23:52.595 --> 01:23:54.262
What was that?

584
01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:32.967
Go left.

585
01:25:13.258 --> 01:25:15.343
Get out.

586
01:26:07.563 --> 01:26:13.109
Either you've brought me the perfect gift,
or you've made me a very unhappy man.

587
01:26:13.318 --> 01:26:16.195
Mishkin got to them before I could.

588
01:26:17.072 --> 01:26:19.782
Bond is alive?

589
01:26:19.867 --> 01:26:23.745
- He escaped.
- Good for Bond.

590
01:26:23.829 --> 01:26:26.414
Bad for you.

591
01:26:28.417 --> 01:26:31.002
Take a seat, my dear.

592
01:26:47.478 --> 01:26:50.688
You know, James and I
shared everything.

593
01:26:52.399 --> 01:26:54.859
Absolutely everything.

594
01:26:59.907 --> 01:27:01.157
To the victor go the spoils.

595
01:27:11.084 --> 01:27:12.710
You'll like it where we're going.

596
01:27:19.468 --> 01:27:21.552
You may even learn to like me.

597
01:27:29.353 --> 01:27:31.312
<i>Svinya.</i>

598
01:27:31.396 --> 01:27:33.272
Stay with her.

599
01:27:39.363 --> 01:27:42.281
Bond. Only Bond.

600
01:27:42.616 --> 01:27:45.326
He's going to derail us.

601
01:27:46.328 --> 01:27:48.371
<i>-Full speed.
- Shto?</i>

602
01:27:48.455 --> 01:27:50.122
Full speed. Ram him.

603
01:27:51.708 --> 01:27:53.000
Bye-bye.

604
01:28:55.689 --> 01:28:58.566
Why can't you just
be a good boy and die?

605
01:28:58.650 --> 01:29:00.276
You first.

606
01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:02.445
You second.

607
01:29:03.363 --> 01:29:05.031
Up.

608
01:29:08.452 --> 01:29:11.996
Situation analysis: hopeless.

609
01:29:13.123 --> 01:29:16.208
You have no backup, no escape route.

610
01:29:16.293 --> 01:29:19.211
And I have the only bargaining chip.

611
01:29:19.296 --> 01:29:23.799
- Where is she?
- Ah, yes. Your fatal weakness.

612
01:29:25.427 --> 01:29:27.970
Ourumov, bring her in.

613
01:29:29.765 --> 01:29:31.641
Lovely girl.

614
01:29:31.725 --> 01:29:35.353
Tastes like... like strawberries.

615
01:29:35.646 --> 01:29:38.689
- I wouldn't know.
- I would.

616
01:29:45.781 --> 01:29:47.949
So, back where we started, James.

617
01:29:49.159 --> 01:29:51.744
Your friend, or the mission?

618
01:29:52.245 --> 01:29:54.455
Drop the gun. I'll let her live.

619
01:29:58.126 --> 01:30:02.505
Ourumov, what has
this Cossack promised you?

620
01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:07.176
You knew, didn't you?
He's a Lienz Cossack.

621
01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:12.056
- It's in the past.
- He'll betray you. Just like everyone else.

622
01:30:12.391 --> 01:30:15.267
- Is this true?
- What's true is that in 48 hours

623
01:30:15.352 --> 01:30:18.479
you and I will have more money than God,

624
01:30:18.772 --> 01:30:22.108
and Mr. Bond here will have
a small memorial service

625
01:30:22.401 --> 01:30:27.738
with only Moneypenny and a few
tearful restaurateurs in attendance.

626
01:30:27.823 --> 01:30:30.950
So, what's the choice, James?

627
01:30:31.410 --> 01:30:35.162
Two targets, time enough for one shot.

628
01:30:35.497 --> 01:30:37.456
The girl, or the mission?

629
01:30:37.958 --> 01:30:40.751
Kill her. She means nothing to me.

630
01:30:43.922 --> 01:30:46.424
See you in hell, James.

631
01:30:56.935 --> 01:31:01.564
- One-inch armour plating.
- I'm fine, thank you very much!

632
01:31:06.236 --> 01:31:08.529
Boris. Yes.

633
01:31:09.156 --> 01:31:12.366
- What are you doing?
- Boris is on-line backing up his files.

634
01:31:12.451 --> 01:31:16.787
If I can spike him, I might be able
to find out where they're going.

635
01:31:18.582 --> 01:31:22.376
- Don't stand there. Get us out of here.
- Yes, sir.

636
01:31:40.562 --> 01:31:42.688
<i>Good luck with the floor, James.</i>

637
01:31:42.773 --> 01:31:46.525
<i>I set the timers for six minutes -
the same six minutes you gave me.</i>

638
01:31:47.444 --> 01:31:50.029
It was the least I could do for a friend.

639
01:31:52.282 --> 01:31:55.534
- What does that mean?
- We've got three minutes.

640
01:32:29.111 --> 01:32:31.529
- What else do you call your bottom?
- What?

641
01:32:31.613 --> 01:32:35.699
Boris' password. He plays word games.
"What I sit on but don't take with me."

642
01:32:35.784 --> 01:32:38.744
- Chair.
- Like I said...

643
01:32:43.083 --> 01:32:44.166
30 seconds.

644
01:32:44.251 --> 01:32:47.920
He's not in Russia,
Germany, Paris, London, Madrid...

645
01:32:48.004 --> 01:32:51.132
- 25 seconds.
- New York, Toronto, Chicago,

646
01:32:51.216 --> 01:32:53.175
- San Francisco...
- 20 seconds.

647
01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:55.594
Mexico City, Rio, Miami...

648
01:33:01.518 --> 01:33:05.271
- Come on.
- Wait. He's in Cuba. Havana -no.

649
01:33:06.523 --> 01:33:07.606
Now.

650
01:33:27.544 --> 01:33:30.880
Do you destroy
every vehicle you get into?

651
01:33:30.964 --> 01:33:33.674
Standard operating procedure.

652
01:33:35.010 --> 01:33:37.344
Boys with toys.

653
01:33:39.973 --> 01:33:44.894
Maybe I should take care of
the transportation for our trip to Cuba.

654
01:33:45.187 --> 01:33:46.520
Our trip?

655
01:33:46.771 --> 01:33:49.899
Do you know how to disarm the weapon?

656
01:33:51.359 --> 01:33:56.572
I suppose that depends on what kind of
weapon you're talking about disarming.

657
01:33:57.324 --> 01:34:03.829
So, tell me. Are there any other
standard operating procedures

658
01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:07.583
I should be aware of, Commander?

659
01:34:11.588 --> 01:34:13.547
Thousands.

660
01:34:13.632 --> 01:34:16.175
But I only pay them

661
01:34:16.718 --> 01:34:18.802
lip service.

662
01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:45.371
My whole life I dreamed
about coming to the Caribbean.

663
01:34:45.455 --> 01:34:47.706
It's so beautiful.

664
01:34:47.791 --> 01:34:50.042
Not another human being in sight.

665
01:35:03.139 --> 01:35:05.849
What is it with you and moving vehicles?

666
01:35:30.625 --> 01:35:35.838
Yo, Jimbo. Brought a little gift
from old whatshisname? T? Z?

667
01:35:36.131 --> 01:35:37.631
- Q.
- Yeah.

668
01:35:37.716 --> 01:35:41.385
- What are you doing here, Wade?
- Banyan trees.

669
01:35:41.761 --> 01:35:45.180
I am not here. The CIA has
no knowledge, no involvement.

670
01:35:45.265 --> 01:35:49.268
Nothing to do with your insertion
into Cuba, if you catch my drift.

671
01:35:49.352 --> 01:35:50.644
Yes, I do.

672
01:35:50.979 --> 01:35:53.272
Borrowed the plane
from a friend in the DEA.

673
01:35:53.815 --> 01:35:55.899
The Coast Guard and the FAA
are in the loop.

674
01:35:55.984 --> 01:35:58.694
You're cleared on our radar
for 0600 hours.

675
01:35:59.029 --> 01:36:01.196
Here's the latest sat-int from Langley.

676
01:36:01.281 --> 01:36:05.075
- Stay below 600 feet.
- 500 feet.

677
01:36:05.410 --> 01:36:07.745
- Who's that?
- Natalya Simonova.

678
01:36:07.829 --> 01:36:10.914
- Sim-yo-nova.
- Russian minister of transportation.

679
01:36:14.127 --> 01:36:16.503
Did you check her out?

680
01:36:16.838 --> 01:36:20.424
- Head to toe.
- Right...

681
01:36:21.217 --> 01:36:25.387
So, you're lookin' for a dish the size
of a football field, huh? Doesn't exist.

682
01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:29.058
- Light a cigar in Cuba and we see it.
- I know it's there.

683
01:36:29.267 --> 01:36:34.063
It's a duplicate of Severnaya, like
your secret transmitters in New Zealand.

684
01:36:34.397 --> 01:36:36.982
I've never been there.
How does she know about that?

685
01:36:37.067 --> 01:36:41.862
- What if I need backup?
- Get on the radio. I'll send in the marines.

686
01:36:42.364 --> 01:36:44.823
Anyway, hang a left
at the end of the runway.

687
01:36:44.908 --> 01:36:48.869
- Cuba's 80 miles on your right.
- Yo, Wade.

688
01:36:51.790 --> 01:36:55.167
Just one thing. Don't push
any of the buttons on that car.

689
01:36:55.251 --> 01:36:58.712
- I'm just gonna bomb around in it.
- Exactly.

690
01:36:59.381 --> 01:37:02.174
Yo, James. I got faith, but be careful.

691
01:37:02.258 --> 01:37:05.010
He knows you're comin'.

692
01:38:08.116 --> 01:38:10.701
He was your friend -Trevelyan.

693
01:38:12.704 --> 01:38:15.747
And now he's your enemy
and you will kill him.

694
01:38:17.792 --> 01:38:20.794
It is that simple?

695
01:38:20.879 --> 01:38:23.797
In a word, yes.

696
01:38:24.257 --> 01:38:26.425
- Unless he kills you first.
- Natalya...

697
01:38:26.509 --> 01:38:31.722
You think I'm impressed? With your guns,
your killing, your death. For what?

698
01:38:31.806 --> 01:38:34.308
So you can be a hero?

699
01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:37.853
- All the heroes I know are dead.
- Natalya...

700
01:38:37.937 --> 01:38:41.106
How can you act like this?
How can you be so cold?

701
01:38:43.234 --> 01:38:45.944
It's what keeps me alive.

702
01:38:46.988 --> 01:38:50.157
No. It's what keeps you alone.

703
01:39:29.614 --> 01:39:31.698
James...

704
01:39:33.159 --> 01:39:35.244
Yes?

705
01:39:41.751 --> 01:39:44.711
On the train,

706
01:39:44.796 --> 01:39:49.341
when you told him to kill me
and that I meant nothing to you,

707
01:39:49.425 --> 01:39:51.802
did you mean it?

708
01:39:53.471 --> 01:39:55.347
Yes.

709
01:39:56.140 --> 01:39:59.476
Basic rule: always call their bluff.

710
01:40:04.148 --> 01:40:05.816
No.

711
01:40:38.766 --> 01:40:43.145
Turn ten degrees south, bearing 1 -8-4.

712
01:40:43.229 --> 01:40:45.105
Yes, sir.

713
01:41:09.547 --> 01:41:13.091
Nothing. There is nothing here.

714
01:41:13.926 --> 01:41:16.011
Let's make another pass.

715
01:41:28.983 --> 01:41:31.234
Maybe Wade was right. There is no dish.

716
01:42:29.919 --> 01:42:31.586
Natalya.

717
01:43:31.856 --> 01:43:37.068
This time, Mr. Bond,
the pleasure will be all mine.

718
01:43:56.255 --> 01:43:57.672
You wait for your turn.

719
01:44:32.124 --> 01:44:33.917
She always did enjoy a good squeeze.

720
01:44:45.555 --> 01:44:48.723
- Is the satellite in range?
- Six minutes.

721
01:44:48.808 --> 01:44:52.060
- Prepare the dish.
- No. It's too early.

722
01:44:52.311 --> 01:44:55.438
- I am not ready.
- Do it.

723
01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:27.137
No wonder we couldn't see it.

724
01:45:38.441 --> 01:45:40.525
Come on.

725
01:45:55.666 --> 01:45:58.585
The world's greatest cash card.

726
01:45:59.754 --> 01:46:02.714
It had better not be rejected.

727
01:47:06.237 --> 01:47:09.364
- Mischa is on-line.
- Sir.

728
01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:16.746
Kill him.

729
01:47:16.831 --> 01:47:18.915
The man just won't take a hint.

730
01:47:20.543 --> 01:47:24.546
- Target coordinates?
- The target is London.

731
01:47:37.393 --> 01:47:40.020
He's getting ready to signal the satellite.

732
01:47:40.438 --> 01:47:43.148
- How do you stop it?
- The transmitter above the antenna.

733
01:48:15.389 --> 01:48:16.890
Antenna in position.

734
01:48:20.603 --> 01:48:21.853
On my count.

735
01:48:22.855 --> 01:48:26.066
Three, two, one.

736
01:48:55.262 --> 01:48:57.347
God save the Queen.

737
01:49:16.492 --> 01:49:19.619
- The mainframe computer.
- Don't move.

738
01:50:46.373 --> 01:50:49.375
James. What an unpleasant surprise.

739
01:50:49.877 --> 01:50:53.004
- We aim to please.
- Where's the girl?

740
01:50:53.714 --> 01:50:55.715
Find her.

741
01:51:02.681 --> 01:51:04.724
So, how is old Q?

742
01:51:05.476 --> 01:51:07.644
Up to his usual tricks?

743
01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:10.563
The watch.

744
01:51:15.486 --> 01:51:19.322
A new model. Still press here, do I?

745
01:51:36.173 --> 01:51:37.674
Interesting setup, Alec.

746
01:51:39.426 --> 01:51:41.636
You break into the Bank of England
via computer,

747
01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:44.264
then transfer the money electronically

748
01:51:44.348 --> 01:51:47.100
just seconds before
you set off the GoldenEye,

749
01:51:47.768 --> 01:51:50.937
which erases any record
of the transactions.

750
01:51:51.563 --> 01:51:54.315
- Ingenious.
- Thank you, James.

751
01:51:54.733 --> 01:51:57.527
But it still boils down to petty theft.

752
01:51:58.445 --> 01:52:02.615
In the end, you're just a bank robber.
Nothing more than a common thief.

753
01:52:13.127 --> 01:52:15.586
You always did have
a small mind, James.

754
01:52:16.297 --> 01:52:21.134
It's not just erasing bank records. It's
everything on every computer in London.

755
01:52:21.427 --> 01:52:26.139
Tax records, the stock market,
credit ratings, land registries,

756
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:28.349
criminal records.

757
01:52:28.684 --> 01:52:33.021
In 16 minutes and 43... No, 42 seconds,

758
01:52:33.439 --> 01:52:35.773
the United Kingdom
will re-enter the Stone Age.

759
01:52:35.858 --> 01:52:37.817
A worldwide financial meltdown.

760
01:52:38.944 --> 01:52:43.239
And all so mad little Alec can settle
a score with the world 50 years on.

761
01:52:43.324 --> 01:52:47.618
Please, James. Spare me the Freud.
I might as well ask you

762
01:52:47.703 --> 01:52:51.914
if all the vodka martinis ever silence
the screams of all the men you've killed.

763
01:52:55.336 --> 01:52:58.504
Or if you find forgiveness
in the arms of all those willing women

764
01:52:59.465 --> 01:53:01.716
for all the dead ones
you failed to protect.

765
01:53:04.011 --> 01:53:07.513
England is about to learn
the cost of betrayal,

766
01:53:07.639 --> 01:53:10.350
inflation-adjusted for 1945.

767
01:53:13.145 --> 01:53:15.688
- Welcome to the party, my dear.
- Natalya.

768
01:53:50.516 --> 01:53:53.935
Don't ever do that again.

769
01:53:54.395 --> 01:53:57.688
This is not one of your games, Boris.
Real people will die.

770
01:53:57.773 --> 01:53:59.649
You pathetic little worm.

771
01:54:01.527 --> 01:54:04.028
She was in the mainframe.
Check the computer.

772
01:54:04.113 --> 01:54:07.907
She's a moron.
A second-level programmer.

773
01:54:08.742 --> 01:54:11.619
She works on the guidance system.

774
01:54:11.745 --> 01:54:15.748
She doesn't even have access
to the firing codes.

775
01:54:20.087 --> 01:54:21.504
Retro-rockets firing.

776
01:54:39.606 --> 01:54:45.445
- What the hell's happening?
- We will have re-entry in 12 minutes.

777
01:54:46.905 --> 01:54:49.490
It will burn up
somewhere over the Atlantic.

778
01:54:49.616 --> 01:54:53.578
- Deal with it.
- She changed the access codes.

779
01:54:55.164 --> 01:54:57.665
Then she can fix it.

780
01:55:00.461 --> 01:55:04.130
Go ahead. Shoot him.
He means nothing to me.

781
01:55:05.424 --> 01:55:08.468
I can do it. I can break her codes.

782
01:55:08.594 --> 01:55:11.095
Then get on with it.

783
01:55:38.874 --> 01:55:40.917
Tell him. Now.

784
01:55:41.668 --> 01:55:45.087
Give me the codes, Natalya.
Give them to me.

785
01:56:01.230 --> 01:56:03.898
- Can Boris break your codes?
- Possibly.

786
01:56:04.024 --> 01:56:06.400
Possibly?

787
01:56:06.527 --> 01:56:08.903
We have to destroy the transmitter.

788
01:56:09.029 --> 01:56:12.740
By the way, I'm fine,
thank you very much!

789
01:56:40.894 --> 01:56:42.395
Do you know how to use one of these?

790
01:56:45.899 --> 01:56:47.316
Yes.

791
01:56:47.401 --> 01:56:49.527
Good. Stay out of sight.

792
01:57:04.418 --> 01:57:06.335
- How long?
- Two minutes.

793
01:57:06.420 --> 01:57:08.004
- One minute.
- Guard.

794
01:57:08.088 --> 01:57:12.717
- I'm fixing it.
- If he moves, kill him.

795
01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:37.510
Yes. I am invincible.

796
02:00:48.475 --> 02:00:51.560
You know, James?

797
02:00:51.645 --> 02:00:53.270
I was always better.

798
02:01:10.705 --> 02:01:11.914
Alpha One to Gunship.

799
02:01:12.958 --> 02:01:15.417
<i>Alpha One to Gunship.</i>

800
02:02:16.146 --> 02:02:18.022
Speak to me.

801
02:02:53.099 --> 02:02:54.975
For England, James?

802
02:02:55.852 --> 02:02:57.311
No.

803
02:02:58.188 --> 02:02:59.647
For me.

804
02:04:18.935 --> 02:04:21.437
Yes. I am invincible.

805
02:04:46.212 --> 02:04:49.757
James. James. Are you all right?

806
02:04:53.636 --> 02:04:56.013
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.

807
02:05:06.107 --> 02:05:08.817
Suppose someone is watching?

808
02:05:09.861 --> 02:05:13.489
There's no one within 25 miles,
believe me.

809
02:05:13.573 --> 02:05:16.033
Yo, Jimbo.

810
02:05:24.501 --> 02:05:28.879
Is this supposed to be your idea
of "coming through in a clinch"?

811
02:05:30.507 --> 02:05:32.360
It's tobacco plants.

812
02:05:32.926 --> 02:05:34.885
I said I'd be here, huh?

813
02:05:34.969 --> 02:05:37.262
Yo. Marines.

814
02:05:47.315 --> 02:05:52.861
Maybe you two'd like to finish debriefing
each other at Guantanamo?

815
02:05:53.613 --> 02:05:55.823
- Ready?
- I'm not going on a helicopter with you.

816
02:05:55.949 --> 02:05:59.243
No plane, no train, nothing that moves.

817
02:05:59.327 --> 02:06:02.788
Darling, what could
possibly go wrong, hey?
