1
00:03:13.963 --> 00:03:16.075
I beg your pardon.
I forgot to knock.

2
00:04:04.112 --> 00:04:05.606
I’m alone.

3
00:04:09.485 --> 00:04:11.501
Aren’t we all?

4
00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:16.324
- You’re late, 007.
- I had to stop in the bathroom.

5
00:04:16.325 --> 00:04:18.057
Ready to save the world again?

6
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.313
After you, 006.

7
00:04:24.734 --> 00:04:28.236
James, for England.

8
00:04:28.237 --> 00:04:29.731
For England, Alec.

9
00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:14.984
It’s too easy.

10
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.486
Half of everything is luck, James.

11
00:05:18.687 --> 00:05:20.704
And the other half?

12
00:05:21.822 --> 00:05:23.138
Fate.

13
00:05:24.894 --> 00:05:28.049
- Set timers: six minutes.
- Six minutes, check.

14
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.186
Fire!

15
00:05:59.328 --> 00:06:01.929
Closing time, James!
Last call!

16
00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.804
Buy me a pint.

17
00:06:19.681 --> 00:06:23.786
This is Colonel Ourumov! Come out
with your hands above your heads!

18
00:06:23.787 --> 00:06:25.180
How original.

19
00:06:29.156 --> 00:06:32.003
Shut the door, Alec!
There’s a draft!

20
00:06:34.763 --> 00:06:36.257
Alec?

21
00:06:49.443 --> 00:06:53.314
Move out. Throw down your weapon
and walk towards me, slowly.

22
00:06:53.315 --> 00:06:55.559
Finish the job, James!
Blow them all to hell!

23
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.209
You have ten seconds.

24
00:06:59.453 --> 00:07:01.007
Ten...

25
00:07:01.756 --> 00:07:04.329
nine... eight...

26
00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:07.455
seven... six...

27
00:07:08.697 --> 00:07:10.464
five...

28
00:07:10.501 --> 00:07:13.067
four... three... two--

29
00:07:13.068 --> 00:07:14.728
For England, James!

30
00:07:16.771 --> 00:07:19.926
Hold your fire!
You’ll blow the gas tanks!

31
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:24.942
This is your last chance.
Come out with your hands above your--

32
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.510
Wait!

33
00:08:13.093 --> 00:08:14.682
You can’t win.

34
00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:37.875
Get out there! Move!
Move it!

35
00:08:52.333 --> 00:08:53.993
Hold your fire!

36
00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:31.429
Wait!

37
00:13:47.724 --> 00:13:51.594
James, is it really necessary
to drive quite so fast?

38
00:13:51.595 --> 00:13:53.433
More often than you’d think.

39
00:14:03.273 --> 00:14:07.402
I enjoy a spirited ride
as much as the next girl, but--

40
00:14:10.647 --> 00:14:13.352
- Who’s that?
- The next girl.

41
00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:22.251
James, stop this! Stop it!
I know what you’re doing.

42
00:15:22.252 --> 00:15:24.385
Really?
What’s that, dear?

43
00:15:24.386 --> 00:15:27.506
You are just trying to show off
the size of your, your--

44
00:15:27.507 --> 00:15:30.325
- Engine?
- Ego.

45
00:15:30.326 --> 00:15:33.696
We’re having a pleasant drive, and
you’ve got to bring psychology into it.

46
00:15:33.697 --> 00:15:35.977
I was just sent here
to evaluate you.

47
00:15:35.978 --> 00:15:37.982
Let’s try and put that
behind us, shall we?

48
00:16:13.601 --> 00:16:14.954
Ladies first.

49
00:16:31.654 --> 00:16:34.287
- James, I want you to stop this car.
- Really?

50
00:16:34.288 --> 00:16:36.165
Stop this car at once!

51
00:16:43.933 --> 00:16:48.417
As you can see, I have no problem
with female authority.

52
00:16:53.943 --> 00:16:56.090
James, you’re incorrigible.

53
00:16:57.346 --> 00:17:00.081
What am I going to do with you?

54
00:17:00.082 --> 00:17:03.796
Well, let’s toast your evaluation,
shall we?

55
00:17:08.724 --> 00:17:12.437
A very thorough evaluation.

56
00:18:06.147 --> 00:18:08.365
Madame wins.

57
00:18:15.189 --> 00:18:17.477
Bet, Mademoiselle? No?

58
00:18:18.694 --> 00:18:20.595
Monsieur?

59
00:18:20.596 --> 00:18:23.363
Bets, ladies and gentlemen?

60
00:18:23.364 --> 00:18:25.024
No players?

61
00:18:40.248 --> 00:18:44.068
It appears we share the same passions.
Three, anyway.

62
00:18:45.119 --> 00:18:47.119
I count two.

63
00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.826
Motoring and baccarat.

64
00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:58.765
Seven. Madame wins.

65
00:18:58.766 --> 00:19:02.502
I hope the third
is where your real talent lies.

66
00:19:02.503 --> 00:19:04.650
One rises to meet a challenge.

67
00:19:42.376 --> 00:19:44.035
Madame stands with five.

68
00:19:48.116 --> 00:19:50.133
Six. Madame loses.

69
00:19:53.821 --> 00:19:55.821
Enjoy it while it lasts.

70
00:19:55.822 --> 00:19:58.040
The very words I live by.

71
00:20:04.065 --> 00:20:06.426
And what words do you live by?

72
00:20:07.734 --> 00:20:10.318
The trick is to quit
while you’re still ahead.

73
00:20:10.319 --> 00:20:13.909
That’s one trick I’ve never learned.
Perhaps you’ll show me how it’s done.

74
00:20:15.076 --> 00:20:18.145
Vodka martini.
Shaken, not stirred.

75
00:20:18.146 --> 00:20:19.806
And for you?

76
00:20:20.814 --> 00:20:22.511
The same.

77
00:20:22.517 --> 00:20:24.533
How do you take it?

78
00:20:25.452 --> 00:20:27.954
Straight up, with a twist.

79
00:20:30.757 --> 00:20:32.592
Thank you, Mr.--?

80
00:20:32.593 --> 00:20:35.761
The name’s Bond.
James Bond.

81
00:20:35.762 --> 00:20:38.229
Xenia Zaragevna Onatopp.

82
00:20:40.001 --> 00:20:42.468
- Onatopp?
- Onatopp.

83
00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:45.971
Your accent, Georgian?

84
00:20:45.972 --> 00:20:48.141
Very good, Mr. Bond.

85
00:20:48.142 --> 00:20:50.214
- You’ve been to Russia?
- Not recently.

86
00:20:50.215 --> 00:20:53.057
I used to drop in occasionally.
Shoot in and out.

87
00:20:54.182 --> 00:20:57.894
It’s very different now,
a land of opportunity.

88
00:20:58.818 --> 00:21:01.788
With a new Ferrari in every garage?

89
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:04.991
No, not quite.
That belongs to a friend.

90
00:21:04.992 --> 00:21:06.723
A tip for your friend:

91
00:21:06.726 --> 00:21:10.724
The French registration plates for this
year’s model start with the letter ’L.’

92
00:21:10.725 --> 00:21:12.647
Even the counterfeit ones.

93
00:21:14.201 --> 00:21:17.370
Oh. And what rank
do you hold...

94
00:21:17.371 --> 00:21:21.308
with the Motor Vehicles Department,
Mr. Bond?

95
00:21:21.309 --> 00:21:23.040
Commander.

96
00:21:23.044 --> 00:21:26.721
- Shall we go?
- This one is an Admiral.

97
00:21:28.347 --> 00:21:30.565
I like a woman
who enjoys pulling rank.

98
00:21:31.551 --> 00:21:34.221
Nice to meet you, Mr. Bond.

99
00:21:34.222 --> 00:21:37.448
The pleasure, I’m sure,
was all mine.

100
00:23:04.678 --> 00:23:07.074
Transmission begins from Moneypenny.

101
00:23:07.075 --> 00:23:11.649
Identification confirmed:
Onatopp, Xenia. Ex-Soviet fighter pilot.

102
00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:15.837
Current suspected links to the
Janus crime syndicate, St. Petersburg.

103
00:23:15.838 --> 00:23:19.228
Yacht Manticore is leased to
a known Janus corporate front.

104
00:23:19.229 --> 00:23:22.227
M authorizes you
to observe Miss Onatopp...

105
00:23:22.228 --> 00:23:26.964
but stipulates no contact
without prior approval.

106
00:23:26.965 --> 00:23:30.268
End transmission. Moneypenny.
Good night, James.

107
00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:33.045
I trust you’ll stay
’on-a-topp’ of things.

108
00:24:15.648 --> 00:24:19.396
Xenia, I can’t breathe!

109
00:24:28.994 --> 00:24:30.726
Yes! Yes!

110
00:25:37.996 --> 00:25:40.012
My respects, Admiral.

111
00:25:43.534 --> 00:25:45.753
Delighted to have you aboard,
Mademoiselle.

112
00:25:47.839 --> 00:25:50.708
Ladies and gentlemen...

113
00:25:50.709 --> 00:25:54.907
please take your seats on the upper deck
for the demonstration of the aircraft.

114
00:26:28.312 --> 00:26:30.386
What you are about
to see in operation...

115
00:26:30.387 --> 00:26:33.193
is Europe’s answer
to the electronic battlefield:

116
00:26:33.194 --> 00:26:36.787
the first working prototype
of the Tiger helicopter.

117
00:26:36.788 --> 00:26:40.670
Uniquely maneuverable, the Tiger
not only uses stealth technology...

118
00:26:40.671 --> 00:26:42.766
it is the only helicopter
to be hardened against...

119
00:26:42.767 --> 00:26:44.902
all forms of
electronic interference...

120
00:26:44.903 --> 00:26:47.636
radio jamming
and electromagnetic radiation.

121
00:26:57.908 --> 00:27:00.720
I have a small surprise from
your friends back at the barracks.

122
00:27:00.721 --> 00:27:03.080
I think I’ve gone to heaven.

123
00:27:03.081 --> 00:27:05.549
Not yet.

124
00:27:13.357 --> 00:27:15.373
Now please welcome the pilots.

125
00:27:18.829 --> 00:27:21.004
Lieutenant Commander
Bernard Jaubert...

126
00:27:21.005 --> 00:27:23.014
and Lieutenant Francois Brouse.

127
00:28:30.166 --> 00:28:32.183
Select Mir.

128
00:28:32.969 --> 00:28:34.985
Autographic projection.

129
00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.708
Compute possible intercept
with second stage geo-sat two.

130
00:28:49.385 --> 00:28:50.524
Anna.

131
00:28:53.756 --> 00:28:57.231
He wouldn’t know a woman
if one came up and sat on his head.

132
00:28:59.896 --> 00:29:01.034
Boris.

133
00:29:02.765 --> 00:29:04.497
- Boris!
- What?

134
00:29:07.503 --> 00:29:10.136
I thought I’d post it
on the Internet, no?

135
00:29:10.137 --> 00:29:13.775
- What’s the password?
- I made it easy this time.

136
00:29:13.776 --> 00:29:17.074
Even you should be able to break it,
borscht for brains.

137
00:29:18.514 --> 00:29:21.683
All right, all right,
I’ll give you a hint.

138
00:29:21.684 --> 00:29:26.310
They’re right in front of you
and can open very large doors.

139
00:29:28.458 --> 00:29:29.916
You’re such a geek.

140
00:29:32.028 --> 00:29:33.522
Yes, I’m in!

141
00:29:40.334 --> 00:29:42.684
You’ve hacked into
the U.S. Department of Justice.

142
00:29:42.685 --> 00:29:45.766
Do you know what will happen
if they trace it here?

143
00:29:45.767 --> 00:29:48.481
The Chief of Computers
will call me a genius...

144
00:29:48.482 --> 00:29:52.963
move me to Moscow and give me
a million bucks hard currency.

145
00:29:54.483 --> 00:29:56.384
I think not.

146
00:29:56.385 --> 00:30:01.213
Besides, the Americans are slug-heads.
They’ll never detect me.

147
00:30:02.891 --> 00:30:07.018
- You were saying, slug-head?
- Nobody screws with Boris Grishenko!

148
00:30:09.131 --> 00:30:10.660
Spiked them!

149
00:30:10.665 --> 00:30:12.834
Come on, Boris, just hang up.

150
00:30:12.835 --> 00:30:15.682
No way! I spiked them!

151
00:30:17.706 --> 00:30:20.373
All right, what’s the password?

152
00:30:20.374 --> 00:30:22.510
I’m not going to tell you.

153
00:30:22.511 --> 00:30:25.446
Okay, let me guess.

154
00:30:25.447 --> 00:30:28.149
It’s not in front of me?

155
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:32.040
You sit on it,
but you can’t take it with you.

156
00:30:36.491 --> 00:30:40.169
My program seizes the phone line
of whoever’s tracing me...

157
00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:43.500
and jams their modem
so they can’t hang up.

158
00:30:44.198 --> 00:30:47.353
Now the hunted
becomes the hunter.

159
00:30:50.906 --> 00:30:54.008
Better luck next time...

160
00:30:54.009 --> 00:30:55.847
slug-heads!

161
00:30:56.511 --> 00:30:58.041
Bang! Gone!

162
00:30:58.046 --> 00:31:00.334
I am invincible!

163
00:31:06.154 --> 00:31:08.455
Was it good for you, too?

164
00:31:08.456 --> 00:31:11.191
I’m getting some coffee.

165
00:31:11.192 --> 00:31:13.210
I’m going for a cigarette.

166
00:32:17.726 --> 00:32:20.660
General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov...

167
00:32:20.661 --> 00:32:23.330
head of Space Division.

168
00:32:34.275 --> 00:32:36.778
- General, if I’d known--
- You’d have been ready.

169
00:32:36.779 --> 00:32:41.214
This is an unscheduled test of the
Severnaya facility. War simulation.

170
00:32:41.215 --> 00:32:44.551
We are going to test-fire GoldenEye.
Report your status.

171
00:32:44.552 --> 00:32:47.293
Two operational satellites, sir:
Petya and Mischa...

172
00:32:47.294 --> 00:32:50.357
both in 90-minute earth orbit
at 100 kilometers.

173
00:32:50.358 --> 00:32:54.394
Good. Here is the
authorization code.

174
00:32:54.395 --> 00:32:58.559
Now, the GoldenEye and today’s access
numbers for satellite Petya, please.

175
00:32:59.367 --> 00:33:01.620
I am timing you.

176
00:33:32.632 --> 00:33:35.301
Good.
Thank you, Major.

177
00:34:13.007 --> 00:34:14.703
On my count.

178
00:34:14.709 --> 00:34:18.077
Three... two... one.

179
00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.766
Set target: Severnaya.

180
00:34:39.632 --> 00:34:42.373
Arm the weapon.

181
00:35:06.292 --> 00:35:07.607
Check it!

182
00:35:19.806 --> 00:35:24.005
Their best response time is 19 minutes.
They’ll be late.

183
00:35:58.511 --> 00:36:01.950
It’s clean.
I had to ventilate someone.

184
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:41.719
- Good evening, Moneypenny.
- Good evening, James.

185
00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:45.092
M will meet you in the situation room.
I’m to take you straight in.

186
00:36:45.093 --> 00:36:47.543
I’ve never seen you after hours,
Moneypenny. Lovely.

187
00:36:47.544 --> 00:36:50.965
- Thank you, James.
- Out on a professional assignment?

188
00:36:50.966 --> 00:36:52.425
Dressing to kill?

189
00:36:52.431 --> 00:36:55.134
I know you’ll
find this crushing, 007...

190
00:36:55.135 --> 00:36:58.878
but I don’t sit at home every night
praying for an international incident...

191
00:36:58.879 --> 00:37:02.615
so I can run down here all dressed up
to impress James Bond.

192
00:37:02.616 --> 00:37:05.943
I was on a date with a gentleman.
We went to the theater together.

193
00:37:05.944 --> 00:37:08.513
Moneypenny, I’m devastated.

194
00:37:08.514 --> 00:37:11.049
What would I ever do without you?

195
00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:14.762
As far as I can remember, James,
you’ve never had me.

196
00:37:18.091 --> 00:37:20.892
Hope springs eternal.

197
00:37:20.893 --> 00:37:24.607
You know, this sort of behavior
could qualify as sexual harassment.

198
00:37:24.608 --> 00:37:28.132
Really?
What’s the penalty for that?

199
00:37:28.133 --> 00:37:31.229
Someday you have to make good
on your innuendos.

200
00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:38.876
- After you, Moneypenny.
- No, I insist.

201
00:37:38.877 --> 00:37:40.537
You first.

202
00:37:44.683 --> 00:37:47.885
- Good evening, 007.
- Tanner. What’s up?

203
00:37:47.886 --> 00:37:50.460
Sixteen minutes ago,
we intercepted a distress call...

204
00:37:50.461 --> 00:37:53.124
from a supposedly abandoned
radar station at Severnaya.

205
00:37:53.125 --> 00:37:55.629
Look what the satellite picked up.

206
00:37:58.697 --> 00:38:01.865
We found a match:
your missing Tiger.

207
00:38:01.866 --> 00:38:04.302
In the middle of Northern Russia.

208
00:38:04.303 --> 00:38:06.312
It seems your hunch
was right, 007.

209
00:38:06.313 --> 00:38:09.366
It’s too bad the evil Queen of Numbers
wouldn’t let you play it.

210
00:38:13.812 --> 00:38:16.914
- You were saying?
- No, I was just--

211
00:38:16.915 --> 00:38:21.221
Good. Because if I want sarcasm,
Mr. Tanner, I’ll talk to my children.

212
00:38:22.753 --> 00:38:24.937
- Good evening, 007.
- Good evening, M.

213
00:38:24.938 --> 00:38:28.359
The Prime Minister’s
waiting for an update.

214
00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:31.461
Proceed with your briefing,
Mr. Tanner.

215
00:38:31.462 --> 00:38:32.957
Thank you.

216
00:38:34.032 --> 00:38:37.802
After the distress signal,
your helicopter took off...

217
00:38:37.803 --> 00:38:40.490
and the Russians scrambled
these three MIGs here to intercept it.

218
00:38:40.491 --> 00:38:43.125
What do you think the Russians
are using the base for?

219
00:38:43.126 --> 00:38:46.036
Well, at one point we suspected
Severnaya might be the ground station...

220
00:38:46.037 --> 00:38:49.995
for a secret space-based weapons program
called GoldenEye, but--

221
00:38:49.996 --> 00:38:51.957
Our statistical analysis
saw they had...

222
00:38:51.958 --> 00:38:54.311
neither the finance
nor technology to implement it.

223
00:38:54.312 --> 00:38:56.717
Numbers were never
my strong suit.

224
00:38:57.922 --> 00:38:59.690
Are these pictures live?

225
00:39:00.892 --> 00:39:04.675
Unlike the American government, we
prefer not to get our bad news from CNN.

226
00:39:27.819 --> 00:39:30.655
Negative so far.
Everything seems normal.

227
00:40:34.084 --> 00:40:35.578
What the bloody hell was that?

228
00:42:02.671 --> 00:42:04.818
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.

229
00:42:07.677 --> 00:42:10.215
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova!

230
00:43:22.918 --> 00:43:24.412
Boris!

231
00:43:25.287 --> 00:43:26.675
Boris!

232
00:43:26.688 --> 00:43:28.456
Thanks.

233
00:43:28.457 --> 00:43:30.457
Our satellite is knocked out.

234
00:43:30.458 --> 00:43:33.199
So are two of the Americans.

235
00:43:34.162 --> 00:43:38.399
We have another
coming into range...

236
00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.894
now.

237
00:43:42.604 --> 00:43:44.264
Good God.

238
00:43:46.107 --> 00:43:48.108
Two of the MIGs are down.

239
00:43:48.109 --> 00:43:50.957
And it looks like
the third went into the dish.

240
00:43:50.958 --> 00:43:52.947
What do you think?

241
00:43:52.948 --> 00:43:54.815
No lights.

242
00:43:54.816 --> 00:43:57.663
Not one single electric light on
in a 30-mile radius.

243
00:43:58.954 --> 00:44:00.448
E.M.P.?

244
00:44:00.455 --> 00:44:02.744
- That explains the MIGs and satellites.
- And the blackout.

245
00:44:02.745 --> 00:44:04.791
Electromagnetic Pulse:

246
00:44:04.792 --> 00:44:07.584
a first-strike satellite weapon
developed by the--

247
00:44:07.585 --> 00:44:10.232
The Americans and Soviets
during the Cold War.

248
00:44:10.233 --> 00:44:14.101
I’ve read the brief.
Discovered after Hiroshima.

249
00:44:14.102 --> 00:44:16.877
Set off a nuclear device
in the upper atmosphere.

250
00:44:16.878 --> 00:44:18.427
Creates a pulse...

251
00:44:18.439 --> 00:44:21.708
a radiation surge that destroys
everything with an electronic circuit.

252
00:44:21.709 --> 00:44:24.523
The idea being to knock out
the enemy’s communications...

253
00:44:24.524 --> 00:44:27.326
before he, she, or they
could retaliate.

254
00:44:28.516 --> 00:44:30.983
So, GoldenEye exists.

255
00:44:31.919 --> 00:44:33.058
Yes.

256
00:44:33.087 --> 00:44:35.588
- Could this be an accident?
- No.

257
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:37.458
The helicopter.

258
00:44:37.459 --> 00:44:40.657
If you wanted to steal the GoldenEye,
it was the perfect getaway vehicle.

259
00:44:40.658 --> 00:44:44.033
Setting off the blast was the ideal way
to wipe out any trace of the crime.

260
00:44:44.034 --> 00:44:46.266
The Janus group?

261
00:44:46.267 --> 00:44:48.864
It may have been involved
with the helicopter.

262
00:44:49.972 --> 00:44:52.740
I know the Russian
failsafe systems.

263
00:44:52.741 --> 00:44:55.279
You don’t just walk in
and ask for the keys to the bomb.

264
00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.604
You need the access codes.

265
00:45:04.485 --> 00:45:06.633
It had to be an insider.

266
00:45:14.595 --> 00:45:17.062
And at least one person
probably knows who it is.

267
00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:42.402
Very well, sir.
Thank you. Good night.

268
00:45:43.758 --> 00:45:45.767
The Prime Minister’s
talked to Moscow.

269
00:45:45.768 --> 00:45:49.270
They’re saying it was an accident
during a routine training exercise.

270
00:45:49.271 --> 00:45:52.499
Governments change.
The lies stay the same.

271
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.745
What else do we know about
the Janus syndicate?

272
00:45:54.746 --> 00:45:57.865
Topflight arms dealers,
headquartered in St. Petersburg.

273
00:45:57.866 --> 00:46:01.064
The first outfit to restock
the Iraqis during the Gulf War.

274
00:46:01.065 --> 00:46:04.445
The head man’s unreliably described.
No photographs.

275
00:46:04.446 --> 00:46:07.647
The woman, Onatopp...

276
00:46:07.648 --> 00:46:10.016
is our only confirmed contact.

277
00:46:10.017 --> 00:46:13.653
- Would you care for a drink?
- Thank you.

278
00:46:13.654 --> 00:46:17.438
- Your predecessor kept cognac in the--
- I prefer bourbon.

279
00:46:18.025 --> 00:46:19.520
- Ice?
- Yes.

280
00:46:28.135 --> 00:46:30.496
We’ve pulled the files on
anyone who might have had access...

281
00:46:30.497 --> 00:46:33.406
or authority at Severnaya.

282
00:46:33.407 --> 00:46:36.669
The top name on the list is
an old friend of yours, I understand.

283
00:46:40.181 --> 00:46:41.805
Ourumov.

284
00:46:41.815 --> 00:46:44.349
They made him a General.

285
00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:46.934
He sees himself as
the next Iron Man of Russia.

286
00:46:46.935 --> 00:46:50.527
So our political analysts rule him out.
He doesn’t fit the profile of a traitor.

287
00:46:50.528 --> 00:46:53.646
Are these the same analysts
who said that GoldenEye couldn’t exist?

288
00:46:54.862 --> 00:46:57.400
Who said the helicopter
posed no immediate threat...

289
00:46:57.401 --> 00:46:59.901
and wasn’t worth following?

290
00:47:01.267 --> 00:47:04.334
You don’t like me, Bond.
You don’t like my methods.

291
00:47:04.335 --> 00:47:06.239
You think I’m an accountant...

292
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.873
a ’bean counter,’ more interested
in my numbers than your instincts.

293
00:47:08.874 --> 00:47:11.380
- The thought had occurred to me.
- Good.

294
00:47:11.381 --> 00:47:15.181
Because I think you’re a sexist,
misogynist dinosaur.

295
00:47:15.182 --> 00:47:17.382
A relic of the Cold War...

296
00:47:17.383 --> 00:47:20.278
whose boyish charms,
though wasted on me, obviously appeal...

297
00:47:20.279 --> 00:47:23.100
to that young woman
I sent out to evaluate you.

298
00:47:23.101 --> 00:47:26.325
- Point taken.
- Not quite, 007.

299
00:47:26.326 --> 00:47:30.253
If you think for one moment I don’t have
the balls to send a man out to die...

300
00:47:30.254 --> 00:47:32.731
your instincts are dead wrong.

301
00:47:32.732 --> 00:47:35.765
I’ve no compunction about
sending you to your death.

302
00:47:35.766 --> 00:47:39.864
But I won’t do it on a whim, even with
your cavalier attitude towards life.

303
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:46.011
I want you to find GoldenEye.

304
00:47:46.012 --> 00:47:49.688
Find who took it, what they plan
to do with it, and stop it.

305
00:47:49.689 --> 00:47:52.066
And if you should come across Ourumov,
guilty or not...

306
00:47:52.067 --> 00:47:55.147
I don’t want you running off
on some kind of vendetta.

307
00:47:55.148 --> 00:47:57.539
Avenging Alec Trevelyan
will not bring him back.

308
00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:59.991
- You didn’t get him killed.
- Neither did you.

309
00:47:59.992 --> 00:48:02.176
Don’t make it personal.

310
00:48:03.329 --> 00:48:04.823
Never.

311
00:48:08.202 --> 00:48:09.173
Bond.

312
00:48:12.672 --> 00:48:13.988
Come back alive.

313
00:48:55.215 --> 00:48:57.231
Good morning, General Ourumov.

314
00:48:59.552 --> 00:49:01.805
Defense Minister Mishkin,
gentlemen.

315
00:49:02.622 --> 00:49:05.434
Please deliver your report.

316
00:49:08.394 --> 00:49:11.395
As this Council is aware,
72 hours ago...

317
00:49:11.396 --> 00:49:15.074
a secret weapon system code-named
GoldenEye was detonated over Severnaya.

318
00:49:15.075 --> 00:49:17.435
As head of Space Division...

319
00:49:17.436 --> 00:49:20.305
I personally undertook
the investigation.

320
00:49:20.306 --> 00:49:25.010
I have concluded this crime
was committed by Siberian separatists...

321
00:49:25.011 --> 00:49:27.680
seeking to create
political unrest.

322
00:49:28.648 --> 00:49:30.657
Regrettably,
the peaceful work...

323
00:49:30.658 --> 00:49:33.188
and much-needed hard currency
earnings of Severnaya...

324
00:49:33.189 --> 00:49:36.255
have been set back
by several years.

325
00:49:36.256 --> 00:49:38.272
Therefore,
I tender my resignation.

326
00:49:41.394 --> 00:49:45.069
It seems the Council does not
want your head, Arkady Grigorovich.

327
00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:48.540
Merely your loyal assurance that
there are no other GoldenEye satellites.

328
00:49:48.541 --> 00:49:50.613
I can give you that assurance,
Defense Minister.

329
00:49:50.614 --> 00:49:53.900
And what of the two missing
Severnaya technicians?

330
00:49:57.175 --> 00:50:01.279
I was aware only of the one,
Boris Grishenko.

331
00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:04.375
There was a girl also
whose body was not among the dead.

332
00:50:04.376 --> 00:50:06.675
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova,
a level-two programmer.

333
00:50:07.854 --> 00:50:10.374
I will investigate immediately,
Defense Minister.

334
00:50:10.375 --> 00:50:12.751
It would seem presumptuous,
General...

335
00:50:12.752 --> 00:50:15.894
to blame this incident
on Siberian separatists...

336
00:50:15.895 --> 00:50:19.442
before the whereabouts
of your own people are determined.

337
00:50:20.433 --> 00:50:21.678
Do you agree?

338
00:50:22.634 --> 00:50:25.036
Yes, Defense Minister.

339
00:50:25.037 --> 00:50:27.326
Thank you for
bringing it to my attention.

340
00:50:29.308 --> 00:50:30.802
That will be all.

341
00:50:45.457 --> 00:50:49.313
Morning, Q.
Sorry about the leg. Skiing?

342
00:50:51.264 --> 00:50:52.331
Hunting!

343
00:50:54.166 --> 00:50:56.967
Right. Now pay attention, 007.

344
00:50:56.968 --> 00:50:59.870
First, your new car, BMW.

345
00:50:59.871 --> 00:51:03.909
Agile, five forward gears,
all-points radar...

346
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:05.710
self-destruct system...

347
00:51:05.711 --> 00:51:09.246
and naturally,
all the usual refinements.

348
00:51:09.247 --> 00:51:12.783
Now, this I’m
particularly proud of.

349
00:51:12.784 --> 00:51:16.252
Behind the headlights,
Stinger missiles.

350
00:51:16.253 --> 00:51:19.659
Excellent. Just the thing for unwinding
after a rough day at the office.

351
00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.959
Need I remind you, 007...

352
00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:24.328
that you have a license to kill...

353
00:51:24.329 --> 00:51:27.465
not to break the traffic laws.

354
00:51:27.466 --> 00:51:29.538
- I wouldn’t think of it.
- Good.

355
00:51:29.539 --> 00:51:32.072
Right. Let’s get on
to more practical matters.

356
00:51:32.073 --> 00:51:34.873
A typical leather belt.

357
00:51:34.874 --> 00:51:38.836
Male, size 34, buckle notch.

358
00:51:41.513 --> 00:51:43.813
- Have you finished?
- Yes.

359
00:51:43.814 --> 00:51:45.883
Good. A typical leather belt.

360
00:51:45.884 --> 00:51:47.723
Q, I’m familiar with that device.

361
00:51:47.724 --> 00:51:52.390
Not one with a 75-foot rappelling cord
built into the buckle.

362
00:51:52.391 --> 00:51:55.725
Fire, and out shoots a piton...

363
00:51:55.726 --> 00:51:59.616
followed by a high-tensile wire
designed to support your weight.

364
00:51:59.617 --> 00:52:02.967
I see. And what if I need
additional support?

365
00:52:02.968 --> 00:52:05.566
It’s tested for one, 007.

366
00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:12.516
Flight 878 to St. Petersburg.

367
00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:18.149
X-ray document scanner.

368
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:21.252
A pen.
This is a Class Four grenade.

369
00:52:21.253 --> 00:52:24.954
Three clicks
arms the four-second fuse.

370
00:52:24.955 --> 00:52:27.625
Another three disarms it.

371
00:52:30.661 --> 00:52:33.330
How long did you say the fuse was?

372
00:52:33.331 --> 00:52:35.433
Oh, grow up, 007!

373
00:52:35.434 --> 00:52:37.450
They always said the pen
was mightier than the sword.

374
00:52:37.451 --> 00:52:40.171
Thanks to me, they were right.

375
00:52:40.172 --> 00:52:44.274
Look, let’s ask Freddie here
to demonstrate for us.

376
00:52:44.275 --> 00:52:46.677
Here we are.
Sorry about this, Fred.

377
00:52:46.678 --> 00:52:48.789
One... two... three.

378
00:52:54.952 --> 00:52:56.953
Don’t say it.

379
00:52:56.954 --> 00:52:58.955
The writing’s on the wall?

380
00:52:58.956 --> 00:53:01.008
Along with the rest of him.

381
00:53:02.093 --> 00:53:05.734
Now, 007, do please try
and return some of--

382
00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:12.041
Do please try and return some of
this equipment in pristine order.

383
00:53:12.042 --> 00:53:15.273
Don’t touch that!
It’s my lunch.

384
00:53:41.165 --> 00:53:43.241
In London,
April’s a spring month.

385
00:53:43.242 --> 00:53:46.269
Oh, yeah?
And what are you, the weatherman?

386
00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:49.152
For crying out loud,
another stiff-assed Brit...

387
00:53:49.153 --> 00:53:52.008
with your secret codes
and your passwords.

388
00:53:52.009 --> 00:53:55.033
One of these days you guys
are going to learn just to drop it.

389
00:53:55.034 --> 00:53:57.340
Come on, my car’s over there.

390
00:54:12.563 --> 00:54:14.580
- After you.
- Thank you.

391
00:54:17.435 --> 00:54:19.837
Like you said, drop it.

392
00:54:19.838 --> 00:54:21.905
In London,
April’s a spring month...

393
00:54:21.906 --> 00:54:23.982
whereas in St. Petersburg
we’re freezing our butts off!

394
00:54:23.983 --> 00:54:26.050
Now, is that close enough
for government work?

395
00:54:26.051 --> 00:54:29.197
No. Show me the rose.

396
00:54:29.979 --> 00:54:31.474
Please, no.

397
00:54:31.483 --> 00:54:33.700
All right, all right, all right!

398
00:54:46.197 --> 00:54:49.065
- Muffy?
- Third wife.

399
00:54:49.066 --> 00:54:52.601
- Jack Wade, CIA.
- James Bond, stiff-assed Brit.

400
00:54:52.602 --> 00:54:54.738
- That’s a nice move.
- Nice car.

401
00:54:54.739 --> 00:54:56.609
This baby hasn’t let me down yet.

402
00:54:56.610 --> 00:54:59.239
She’s an ugly little bitch,
but she gets you there.

403
00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:01.843
Hey, Bond, you do any gardening?

404
00:55:18.728 --> 00:55:20.745
Hand me that wrench, Jimmy?

405
00:55:21.899 --> 00:55:25.033
- What do you know about Janus?
- Zilch. Zipsky.

406
00:55:25.034 --> 00:55:28.853
No one’s ever seen him.
But the man’s connected up the kazoo.

407
00:55:28.854 --> 00:55:31.833
KGB, military.
Screwdriver.

408
00:55:33.611 --> 00:55:37.630
Rumor has it, he lives on one of
those old Soviet missile trains...

409
00:55:37.631 --> 00:55:41.801
that armored stuff they ran around
the country so we couldn’t target them.

410
00:55:41.802 --> 00:55:43.933
Want to hand me
that hammer, Jimbo?

411
00:55:45.322 --> 00:55:48.057
No, the bigger one.
The sledge.

412
00:55:48.058 --> 00:55:52.327
Anyways, to tell the truth,
you don’t find this guy. He finds you.

413
00:55:52.328 --> 00:55:55.397
Hell, it’s all Russian Mafia.

414
00:55:55.398 --> 00:55:59.039
The best thing I can do is point you
in the direction of his competition.

415
00:56:03.274 --> 00:56:06.141
- Who is the competition?
- An ex-KGB guy.

416
00:56:06.142 --> 00:56:09.024
A tough mother. Got a limp on
his right leg. Name’s Zukovsky.

417
00:56:09.025 --> 00:56:12.815
- Valentin Dimiterveych Zukovsky?
- Yeah. You know him?

418
00:56:12.816 --> 00:56:15.248
I gave him the limp.

419
00:56:40.109 --> 00:56:41.425
Yes?

420
00:56:42.344 --> 00:56:44.514
Are these all you have?

421
00:56:44.515 --> 00:56:47.483
How many do you want?

422
00:56:47.484 --> 00:56:50.675
Twenty-four for the American school,
eleven for the Swedish.

423
00:56:50.676 --> 00:56:53.489
IBM compatible
with 500 meg. hard drives...

424
00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:56.991
CD ROM and 14.4 modems.

425
00:56:56.992 --> 00:56:59.361
- Will you pay dollars?
- Of course.

426
00:56:59.362 --> 00:57:01.711
If madame would require
a demonstration, I could--

427
00:57:01.712 --> 00:57:05.518
Madame requires one demonstration model
and a quiet place to test it.

428
00:57:20.517 --> 00:57:21.656
Natalya.

429
00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:39.567
Is everything satisfactory?

430
00:57:39.568 --> 00:57:41.893
Everything except the interruption.

431
00:57:55.218 --> 00:57:57.294
Now let me get you straight, Jimmy.

432
00:57:57.295 --> 00:58:01.390
You shot him in the leg,
you stole his car, you took his girl.

433
00:58:01.391 --> 00:58:04.416
And now you want Valentin Zukovsky
to set you up with Janus?

434
00:58:04.417 --> 00:58:05.889
Yes.

435
00:58:05.894 --> 00:58:08.255
Well, what are you going to do?
Appeal to his heart?

436
00:58:08.256 --> 00:58:10.164
No, his wallet.

437
00:58:10.165 --> 00:58:13.748
Oh, that might work.
Okay, show time.

438
00:58:19.042 --> 00:58:22.243
Valentin operates out of
building number 23 there.

439
00:58:22.244 --> 00:58:24.115
Are you sure
you want to do this?

440
00:58:24.116 --> 00:58:27.374
Last guy who dropped in uninvited
went home airfreight...

441
00:58:27.375 --> 00:58:29.464
in very small boxes.

442
00:58:30.486 --> 00:58:33.024
Make sure they
send me home first-class.

443
00:59:27.643 --> 00:59:29.944
Natalya, it’s me!
It’s Boris!

444
00:59:29.945 --> 00:59:32.483
It’s Boris! It’s Boris!
Hello.

445
00:59:37.619 --> 00:59:40.216
Another morning shot to hell.

446
00:59:41.955 --> 00:59:45.396
Free market economy.
I swear it will be the end of me.

447
00:59:50.598 --> 00:59:54.166
Walther PPK,
7.65 millimeter.

448
00:59:54.167 --> 00:59:56.937
Only three men I know
use such a gun.

449
00:59:56.938 --> 00:59:59.473
I believe I’ve killed
two of them.

450
00:59:59.474 --> 01:00:01.134
Lucky me.

451
01:00:02.010 --> 01:00:03.326
I think not.

452
01:00:28.403 --> 01:00:30.277
James Bond.

453
01:00:31.706 --> 01:00:34.731
Charming, sophisticated
secret agent.

454
01:00:36.544 --> 01:00:38.560
Shaken but not stirred.

455
01:00:39.714 --> 01:00:43.605
I see you haven’t lost your
delicate sense of humor, Valentin, huh?

456
01:00:43.606 --> 01:00:46.320
Or your need for an audience.

457
01:00:46.321 --> 01:00:48.337
Who’s strangling the cat?

458
01:00:49.424 --> 01:00:50.918
Strangling a cat?

459
01:00:56.496 --> 01:00:58.750
That is Irina, my mistress.

460
01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.268
A very talented girl.

461
01:01:03.838 --> 01:01:06.305
Irina! Take a hike!

462
01:01:10.877 --> 01:01:12.713
So, Mr. Bond...

463
01:01:12.714 --> 01:01:15.982
what is it that brings you
to my neighborhood, hmm?

464
01:01:15.983 --> 01:01:18.084
Still working for MI6...

465
01:01:18.085 --> 01:01:20.861
or have you decided
to join the 21st century?

466
01:01:21.756 --> 01:01:23.756
I hear the new M is a lady.

467
01:01:23.757 --> 01:01:26.355
I want you to do me a favor.

468
01:01:28.895 --> 01:01:31.813
He wants me to do him a favor!

469
01:01:33.333 --> 01:01:35.935
My knee aches...

470
01:01:35.936 --> 01:01:40.106
every single day,
twice as bad when it is cold.

471
01:01:40.107 --> 01:01:43.547
Have you any idea how long
the winter lasts in this country, hmm?

472
01:01:43.548 --> 01:01:45.031
Tell him, Dimitri!

473
01:01:45.046 --> 01:01:47.414
- Well, it depends--
- Silence!

474
01:01:47.415 --> 01:01:51.317
For an ex-KGB agent,
you surprise me, Valentin.

475
01:01:51.318 --> 01:01:54.544
Someone of your stature must’ve realized
the skill was not to hit your knee...

476
01:01:54.545 --> 01:01:57.335
but to...
miss the rest of you.

477
01:01:59.126 --> 01:02:00.858
So why did you not kill me?

478
01:02:02.362 --> 01:02:04.378
Call it professional courtesy.

479
01:02:05.465 --> 01:02:09.106
Then I should extend you
the same courtesy.

480
01:02:11.370 --> 01:02:13.732
Kirov’s funeral parlor,
4:00 this afternoon.

481
01:02:15.575 --> 01:02:19.111
Two hundred pounds of C4 explosives
hidden in a casket.

482
01:02:19.112 --> 01:02:22.647
Your man drives the hearse in,
the money’s exchanged...

483
01:02:22.648 --> 01:02:25.151
their man drives the hearse out.

484
01:02:25.152 --> 01:02:28.012
Their man will be arrested
with the explosives.

485
01:02:28.013 --> 01:02:30.385
Your man will make
a miraculous escape with the money.

486
01:02:31.358 --> 01:02:32.852
Your money.

487
01:02:34.094 --> 01:02:37.028
And what do I owe
for this accommodation?

488
01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:40.469
I want you to set me up...
with Janus.

489
01:02:41.268 --> 01:02:43.736
What has he done to deserve you?

490
01:02:43.737 --> 01:02:46.372
- Stole a helicopter.
- I have six.

491
01:02:46.373 --> 01:02:48.441
Three. None that fly.

492
01:02:48.442 --> 01:02:50.241
Who’s counting?

493
01:02:50.242 --> 01:02:52.625
These are not just criminals,
Valentin, they’re traitors.

494
01:02:52.626 --> 01:02:55.387
They used the chopper
to steal a nuclear weapon.

495
01:02:55.388 --> 01:02:58.384
Killed a lot of
innocent Russians doing it.

496
01:02:58.385 --> 01:03:01.090
- What do you expect from a Cossack?
- Who?

497
01:03:02.089 --> 01:03:05.764
This Janus, I’ve never met the man,
but I know he’s a Lienz Cossack.

498
01:03:05.765 --> 01:03:09.469
Group that worked for the Nazis
against the Russians, Second World War.

499
01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:12.047
You know your history, Mr. Bond.
At the end of the war...

500
01:03:12.048 --> 01:03:15.707
the Lienz Cossacks surrendered
to the British in Austria...

501
01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:20.130
believing they’d join your government
and wage war against the communists.

502
01:03:20.131 --> 01:03:22.082
But, the British betrayed them...

503
01:03:22.083 --> 01:03:25.929
sent them promptly back to Stalin
who promptly had them all shot--

504
01:03:25.930 --> 01:03:28.515
women, children, families.

505
01:03:29.483 --> 01:03:31.427
Not exactly our finest hour.

506
01:03:33.085 --> 01:03:37.021
Still, ruthless people.
They got what they deserved.

507
01:03:37.022 --> 01:03:40.462
I want you to set me up with Janus.
Tell him I’m asking about the chopper.

508
01:03:40.463 --> 01:03:42.965
You’re going to meet me tonight
at the Grand Hotel Europe.

509
01:03:42.966 --> 01:03:46.819
And then, you and I are even
and he owes me one?

510
01:03:47.933 --> 01:03:49.072
Precisely.

511
01:04:50.962 --> 01:04:53.997
You don’t need the gun,
Commander.

512
01:04:53.998 --> 01:04:57.404
That depends on your definition
of ’safe sex.’

513
01:05:03.075 --> 01:05:05.442
That’s close enough.

514
01:05:05.443 --> 01:05:07.839
Not for what I have in mind.

515
01:05:31.570 --> 01:05:34.487
Oh, you think you can hurt me?

516
01:05:53.658 --> 01:05:56.019
You think you can break me?

517
01:06:04.203 --> 01:06:05.970
Yes! Yes!

518
01:06:06.007 --> 01:06:07.109
Yes!

519
01:06:13.212 --> 01:06:14.944
No, no, no.

520
01:06:16.414 --> 01:06:18.632
No more foreplay.

521
01:06:19.817 --> 01:06:22.035
Take me to Janus.

522
01:06:37.068 --> 01:06:39.536
- This is it?
- Yes.

523
01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:46.678
Well, I must say,
I’ve had a lovely evening. You?

524
01:06:46.679 --> 01:06:49.296
Well, once again,
the pleasure was all yours.

525
01:06:49.297 --> 01:06:51.296
You’ll understand
if I don’t call.

526
01:06:51.297 --> 01:06:53.855
I won’t lose sleep over it.

527
01:06:56.255 --> 01:06:58.093
Sweet dreams.

528
01:08:10.461 --> 01:08:12.121
Hello, James.

529
01:08:34.585 --> 01:08:37.466
- Alec?
- Back from the dead.

530
01:08:38.589 --> 01:08:42.029
No longer just an anonymous star
on the memorial wall at MI6.

531
01:08:43.265 --> 01:08:46.066
What’s the matter, James?
No glib remark?

532
01:08:46.067 --> 01:08:47.834
No pithy comeback?

533
01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:50.286
Why?

534
01:08:52.473 --> 01:08:55.985
Hilarious question,
particularly from you.

535
01:08:56.578 --> 01:08:58.579
Did you ever ask why?

536
01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:02.716
Why we toppled all those dictators,
undermined all those regimes?

537
01:09:02.717 --> 01:09:06.426
Only to come home: ’Well done, good job.
But sorry, old boy.

538
01:09:06.427 --> 01:09:09.317
Everything you risked your life
and limb for has changed.’

539
01:09:09.318 --> 01:09:13.289
- It was the job we were chosen for.
- Of course you’d say that.

540
01:09:13.290 --> 01:09:17.130
James Bond,
Her Majesty’s loyal terrier...

541
01:09:17.131 --> 01:09:19.432
defender of the
so-called ’faith.’

542
01:09:19.433 --> 01:09:21.971
Oh, please, James, put it away.

543
01:09:22.453 --> 01:09:25.752
It’s insulting to think I haven’t
anticipated your every move.

544
01:09:28.992 --> 01:09:30.581
Yes.

545
01:09:32.296 --> 01:09:35.356
- I trusted you, Alec.
- Trust?

546
01:09:36.233 --> 01:09:38.251
What a quaint idea.

547
01:09:39.170 --> 01:09:43.274
How did the MI6 screening miss
that your parents were Lienz Cossacks?

548
01:09:43.275 --> 01:09:47.009
Once again, your faith is misplaced.
They knew.

549
01:09:47.010 --> 01:09:49.645
We’re both orphans, James.

550
01:09:49.646 --> 01:09:53.730
But where your parents had the luxury
of dying in a climbing accident...

551
01:09:53.731 --> 01:09:57.539
mine survived the British betrayal
and Stalin’s execution squads.

552
01:09:58.655 --> 01:10:02.510
But my father couldn’t let himself,
or my mother, live with the shame of it.

553
01:10:04.128 --> 01:10:07.697
MI6 figured I was
too young to remember.

554
01:10:07.698 --> 01:10:10.399
And in one of life’s
little ironies...

555
01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:13.804
the son went to work for
the government whose betrayal...

556
01:10:13.805 --> 01:10:17.073
caused the father
to kill himself and his wife.

557
01:10:17.074 --> 01:10:19.221
Hence, Janus.

558
01:10:20.309 --> 01:10:22.779
The two-faced Roman god
come to life.

559
01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:26.549
It wasn’t God who gave me this face,
it was you...

560
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:29.582
setting the timers for three minutes
instead of six.

561
01:10:29.583 --> 01:10:31.570
Am I supposed
to feel sorry for you?

562
01:10:31.571 --> 01:10:35.066
No. You’re supposed
to die for me.

563
01:10:37.895 --> 01:10:39.695
Oh, by the way...

564
01:10:39.696 --> 01:10:42.792
I did think of asking you
to join my little scheme...

565
01:10:42.793 --> 01:10:45.368
but somehow I knew...

566
01:10:45.369 --> 01:10:50.576
007’s loyalty was always to the mission,
never to his friend.

567
01:10:52.609 --> 01:10:55.728
Closing time, James.
Last call.

568
01:11:10.828 --> 01:11:12.595
For England, James.

569
01:11:12.628 --> 01:11:14.764
Wake up!

570
01:11:14.765 --> 01:11:16.259
Mister!

571
01:11:17.534 --> 01:11:19.734
Wake up, please!

572
01:11:19.735 --> 01:11:21.904
- Wake up!
- I’m here.

573
01:11:21.905 --> 01:11:24.307
- I’m here!
- Hurry!

574
01:11:24.308 --> 01:11:26.843
Hurry up! Come out!

575
01:11:26.844 --> 01:11:28.896
Pull yourself together!
We’re going to die!

576
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:34.450
Do something!
Get us out of here!

577
01:11:34.451 --> 01:11:37.927
I’m a little tied up--
Never mind.

578
01:12:56.298 --> 01:12:59.323
The things that we do
for ’frequent flyer’ mileage.

579
01:13:01.436 --> 01:13:03.637
Here, let me help you.

580
01:13:03.638 --> 01:13:05.714
That’s it, mind your head.

581
01:13:14.116 --> 01:13:16.404
Let me go!

582
01:14:00.195 --> 01:14:02.211
Who are you?

583
01:14:03.665 --> 01:14:06.734
Listen, I’m on your side.
I’m here to help you.

584
01:14:06.735 --> 01:14:08.229
- I don’t know anything.
- I don’t believe you.

585
01:14:08.237 --> 01:14:10.246
- I don’t care what you believe.
- Look!

586
01:14:10.247 --> 01:14:13.402
They might be back for us any minute.
You either take your chances with me...

587
01:14:13.403 --> 01:14:15.735
or your fellow countrymen
who killed everyone at Severnaya.

588
01:14:15.736 --> 01:14:18.645
I’ve never been to Severnaya.

589
01:14:18.646 --> 01:14:22.982
Your watch has.
Frozen by the GoldenEye blast.

590
01:14:22.983 --> 01:14:26.317
And I’m willing to bet you’re the one
who climbed up the dish to get out.

591
01:14:28.423 --> 01:14:30.978
- Who are you?
- I work for the British government.

592
01:14:30.979 --> 01:14:33.542
And the more you tell me,
the more I can help you.

593
01:14:33.543 --> 01:14:37.134
- But I don’t know anything!
- Then let’s start with what you do know.

594
01:14:47.442 --> 01:14:49.553
My name is Natalya Simonova.

595
01:14:50.879 --> 01:14:54.548
I was a systems programmer
at Severnaya facility until--

596
01:14:54.549 --> 01:14:56.316
Go on.

597
01:14:57.886 --> 01:15:01.188
- Until they killed everyone.
- Who? Alec Trevelyan?

598
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:03.189
No. I don’t know who that is.

599
01:15:03.190 --> 01:15:05.926
Who was the insider?
Who was the traitor?

600
01:15:05.927 --> 01:15:08.329
Boris.
Boris Grishenko.

601
01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:12.399
- KGB or military?
- Computer programmer.

602
01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:15.769
- There was no one else?
- No.

603
01:15:17.338 --> 01:15:19.414
They’re going to kill me,
aren’t they?

604
01:15:21.109 --> 01:15:22.603
Trust me.

605
01:15:25.079 --> 01:15:29.077
Trust you?
I don’t even know your name.

606
01:15:30.084 --> 01:15:32.684
Good morning, Mr. Bond.

607
01:15:32.685 --> 01:15:34.179
Sit.

608
01:15:40.862 --> 01:15:43.563
I’m Defense Minister
Dimitri Mishkin.

609
01:15:43.564 --> 01:15:47.004
So, by what means shall we
execute you, Commander Bond?

610
01:15:47.005 --> 01:15:49.102
What, no small talk?

611
01:15:49.103 --> 01:15:52.773
No chitchat?
That’s the trouble with the world today.

612
01:15:52.774 --> 01:15:57.506
No one takes the time to do a sinister
interrogation anymore. It’s a lost art.

613
01:15:57.507 --> 01:16:00.442
Your sense of humor doesn’t slay me,
Commander. I’m sorry.

614
01:16:00.443 --> 01:16:02.727
- Where is the GoldenEye?
- I assumed you had it.

615
01:16:02.728 --> 01:16:06.453
I have an English spy, a Severnaya
programmer and the helicopter they took.

616
01:16:06.454 --> 01:16:08.435
That’s what some traitor in your
government wanted it to look like.

617
01:16:08.423 --> 01:16:11.269
- Who was behind the attack on Severnaya?
- Who had the authorization codes?

618
01:16:11.225 --> 01:16:13.965
Russia may have changed, but the
penalty for terrorism is still death!

619
01:16:13.966 --> 01:16:18.305
- And what’s the penalty for treason?
- Stop it, both of you! Stop it!

620
01:16:18.306 --> 01:16:21.259
You’re like boys with toys.

621
01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:29.208
It was Ourumov.
General Ourumov set off the weapon.

622
01:16:29.209 --> 01:16:31.570
I saw him do it.

623
01:16:32.779 --> 01:16:35.381
Are you certain it was Ourumov?

624
01:16:35.382 --> 01:16:39.759
Yes. He killed everyone
and stole the GoldenEye.

625
01:16:41.589 --> 01:16:43.570
And why would he do that?

626
01:16:44.825 --> 01:16:47.327
There is another satellite.

627
01:16:50.364 --> 01:16:52.381
Another GoldenEye?

628
01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:55.317
Thank you, Miss Simonova.

629
01:16:56.737 --> 01:17:00.248
You were saying something about
the lost art of interrogation, Mr. Bond?

630
01:17:01.674 --> 01:17:04.309
Defense Minister, I must protest!

631
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:07.371
This is my investigation.
You are out of order.

632
01:17:09.116 --> 01:17:12.070
From what I am hearing,
it is you who’s out of order!

633
01:17:13.287 --> 01:17:15.087
- I have seen this gun before.
- Put it down.

634
01:17:15.088 --> 01:17:16.926
- In the hand of our enemy.
- Put it down, General!

635
01:17:16.927 --> 01:17:20.026
Do you even know who
the enemy is, Dimitri?

636
01:17:20.027 --> 01:17:21.759
- Do you?
- Guard!

637
01:17:27.901 --> 01:17:31.092
Defense Minister Dimitri Mishkin...

638
01:17:32.239 --> 01:17:36.272
murdered by a British agent,
James Bond.

639
01:17:38.946 --> 01:17:42.979
Himself shot while
trying to escape. Guards!

640
01:17:54.761 --> 01:17:56.256
Come on!

641
01:18:36.669 --> 01:18:38.293
They’re in the archives!

642
01:18:43.308 --> 01:18:45.005
Down!

643
01:19:35.962 --> 01:19:39.064
Spread out!
Cover the other side!

644
01:19:39.065 --> 01:19:40.725
Trust me.

645
01:20:17.269 --> 01:20:18.824
Go now!

646
01:20:49.135 --> 01:20:50.629
Faster!

647
01:21:11.056 --> 01:21:12.195
Damn it!

648
01:21:19.332 --> 01:21:20.755
Down the alley!

649
01:22:20.992 --> 01:22:23.874
Use the bumper!
That’s what it’s for!

650
01:24:00.089 --> 01:24:01.963
What was that?

651
01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:39.676
Go left!

652
01:25:20.769 --> 01:25:22.537
Get out!

653
01:26:15.457 --> 01:26:18.793
Either you’ve brought me
the perfect gift, General Ourumov...

654
01:26:18.794 --> 01:26:20.836
or you’ve made me
a very unhappy man.

655
01:26:20.837 --> 01:26:23.402
Mishkin got to them
before I could.

656
01:26:24.766 --> 01:26:27.401
Bond is alive?

657
01:26:27.402 --> 01:26:28.896
He escaped.

658
01:26:28.904 --> 01:26:32.309
Good for Bond.
Bad for you.

659
01:26:35.545 --> 01:26:37.870
Take a seat, my dear.

660
01:26:55.096 --> 01:26:57.801
You know, James and I
shared everything.

661
01:27:00.335 --> 01:27:02.517
Absolutely everything.

662
01:27:06.975 --> 01:27:08.991
To the victor go the spoils.

663
01:27:18.753 --> 01:27:20.485
You’ll like it where we’re going.

664
01:27:27.128 --> 01:27:29.667
You may even learn to like me.

665
01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:40.978
Stay with her.

666
01:27:46.948 --> 01:27:48.087
Bond.

667
01:27:48.116 --> 01:27:50.450
Only Bond.

668
01:27:50.451 --> 01:27:52.740
He’s going to derail us.

669
01:27:53.654 --> 01:27:54.793
Full speed!

670
01:27:56.190 --> 01:27:57.850
Full speed! Ram him!

671
01:29:03.190 --> 01:29:05.728
Why can’t you just be
a good boy and die?

672
01:29:05.729 --> 01:29:07.927
You first.

673
01:29:07.928 --> 01:29:10.997
You... second.

674
01:29:10.998 --> 01:29:12.385
Up!

675
01:29:16.170 --> 01:29:19.847
Situation analysis: hopeless.

676
01:29:20.774 --> 01:29:24.243
You have no backup,
no escape route.

677
01:29:24.244 --> 01:29:26.979
And I have the only
bargaining chip.

678
01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:28.713
Where is she?

679
01:29:28.716 --> 01:29:31.907
Oh, yes.
Your fatal weakness.

680
01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:35.445
Ourumov, bring her in.

681
01:29:37.424 --> 01:29:39.492
Lovely girl.

682
01:29:39.493 --> 01:29:43.095
Tastes like...
like strawberries.

683
01:29:43.096 --> 01:29:45.149
- I wouldn’t know.
- I would.

684
01:29:53.740 --> 01:29:55.685
So, back where we started, James.

685
01:29:56.743 --> 01:29:59.546
Your friend or the mission.

686
01:29:59.547 --> 01:30:02.287
Drop the gun.
I’ll let her live.

687
01:30:05.852 --> 01:30:10.300
Ourumov, what has this
Cossack promised you?

688
01:30:11.558 --> 01:30:14.961
You knew, didn’t you?
He’s a Lienz Cossack.

689
01:30:14.962 --> 01:30:18.231
- It’s in the past.
- He’ll betray you!

690
01:30:18.232 --> 01:30:21.600
- Just like everyone else.
- Is this true?

691
01:30:21.601 --> 01:30:26.438
What’s true is that in 48 hours
you and I will have more money than God.

692
01:30:26.439 --> 01:30:29.013
And Mr. Bond here will have
a small memorial service...

693
01:30:30.044 --> 01:30:33.684
with only Moneypenny and a few
tearful restaurateurs in attendance.

694
01:30:35.549 --> 01:30:38.984
So, what’s the choice, James?

695
01:30:38.985 --> 01:30:43.222
Two targets.
Time enough for one shot.

696
01:30:43.223 --> 01:30:45.224
The girl, or the mission?

697
01:30:45.225 --> 01:30:48.523
Kill her.
She means nothing to me.

698
01:30:51.698 --> 01:30:54.165
See you in hell, James.

699
01:31:04.443 --> 01:31:06.444
One-inch armor plating.

700
01:31:06.445 --> 01:31:08.912
I’m fine,
thank you very much!

701
01:31:13.921 --> 01:31:17.523
- Boris, yes!
- What are you doing?

702
01:31:17.524 --> 01:31:19.975
Boris is on-line,
backing up his files.

703
01:31:19.976 --> 01:31:22.949
If I can spike him, I might be able
to find out where they’re going.

704
01:31:25.598 --> 01:31:27.960
But don’t stand there!
Get us out of here!

705
01:31:28.935 --> 01:31:30.074
Yes, sir.

706
01:31:47.954 --> 01:31:50.455
Good luck with the floor, James.

707
01:31:50.456 --> 01:31:54.346
I set the timers for six minutes--
the same six minutes you gave me.

708
01:31:55.228 --> 01:31:57.826
It was the least
I could do for a friend.

709
01:31:59.699 --> 01:32:03.305
- What does that mean?
- We’ve got three minutes.

710
01:32:36.736 --> 01:32:38.194
What else do you call your butt?

711
01:32:38.204 --> 01:32:40.437
- What?
- It’s Boris’ password.

712
01:32:40.438 --> 01:32:43.559
He plays word games: ’What I sit on,
but I don’t take it with me.’

713
01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:46.570
- Chair.
- Like I said.

714
01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:52.244
Thirty seconds.

715
01:32:52.251 --> 01:32:55.687
He’s not in Russia, Germany,
Paris, London, Madrid.

716
01:32:55.688 --> 01:32:57.183
Twenty-five seconds.

717
01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:59.442
New York, Toronto, Chicago,
San Francisco.

718
01:32:59.443 --> 01:33:01.014
Twenty seconds!

719
01:33:01.027 --> 01:33:03.315
Mexico City, Rio, Miami.

720
01:33:08.566 --> 01:33:10.501
- Come on!
- Wait!

721
01:33:10.502 --> 01:33:13.076
He’s in Cuba, Havana. No.

722
01:33:14.206 --> 01:33:15.273
Now!

723
01:33:35.094 --> 01:33:38.663
Do you destroy every vehicle
you get into?

724
01:33:38.664 --> 01:33:40.881
Standard operating procedure.

725
01:33:42.568 --> 01:33:44.893
’Boys with toys.’

726
01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:51.566
Maybe I should take care of
the transportation for our trip to Cuba.

727
01:33:52.711 --> 01:33:54.241
Our trip?

728
01:33:54.245 --> 01:33:56.843
Do you know how
to disarm the weapon?

729
01:33:59.085 --> 01:34:03.319
I suppose that depends on what kind of
weapon you’re talking about disarming.

730
01:34:05.023 --> 01:34:08.292
So, tell me.

731
01:34:08.293 --> 01:34:11.696
Are there any other
standard operating procedures...

732
01:34:11.697 --> 01:34:14.757
I should be aware of, Commander?

733
01:34:19.471 --> 01:34:21.405
Thousands.

734
01:34:21.406 --> 01:34:24.408
But I only pay them...

735
01:34:24.409 --> 01:34:26.319
lip service.

736
01:34:49.434 --> 01:34:53.202
My whole life, I dreamed about
coming to the Caribbean.

737
01:34:53.203 --> 01:34:55.372
It’s so beautiful.

738
01:34:55.373 --> 01:34:58.007
Not another human being in sight.

739
01:35:10.487 --> 01:35:13.608
What is it with you
and moving vehicles?

740
01:35:38.483 --> 01:35:40.036
Yo, Jimbo!

741
01:35:40.050 --> 01:35:43.728
Brought a little gift from
old what’s-his-name, uh, T, Z--?

742
01:35:43.729 --> 01:35:45.422
- Q.
- Yeah.

743
01:35:45.459 --> 01:35:49.093
- What are you doing here, Wade?
- Banyan trees.

744
01:35:49.094 --> 01:35:50.790
I am not here.

745
01:35:50.794 --> 01:35:53.923
The CIA has no knowledge, no
involvement, absolutely nothing to do...

746
01:35:53.924 --> 01:35:56.400
with your insertion into Cuba,
if you catch my drift.

747
01:35:56.401 --> 01:35:58.669
Yes, I do, perfectly.

748
01:35:58.670 --> 01:36:00.984
Borrowed the plane from
a friend of mine in the DEA.

749
01:36:00.985 --> 01:36:03.748
Now, the Coast Guard
and the FAA are both in the loop.

750
01:36:03.749 --> 01:36:06.610
You’re cleared on our radar
for 0600 hours.

751
01:36:06.611 --> 01:36:09.042
Here’s the latest Sat-Int
from Langley.

752
01:36:09.043 --> 01:36:13.050
- Stay below 600 feet.
- 500 feet.

753
01:36:13.051 --> 01:36:15.451
- Who’s that?
- Natalya Siminova.

754
01:36:15.452 --> 01:36:16.946
Natalya Simonova.

755
01:36:16.955 --> 01:36:19.243
Russian Minister of Transportation.

756
01:36:21.825 --> 01:36:24.494
Did you check her out?

757
01:36:24.495 --> 01:36:27.129
- Head to toe.
- Right.

758
01:36:28.967 --> 01:36:32.165
So, you’re looking for a dish
the size of a football field, huh?

759
01:36:32.166 --> 01:36:35.777
Doesn’t exist. You can’t light a cigar
in Cuba without us seeing it.

760
01:36:35.778 --> 01:36:37.162
I know it’s there.

761
01:36:37.174 --> 01:36:40.366
It’s a duplicate of Severnaya, like your
secret transmitters in New Zealand.

762
01:36:41.845 --> 01:36:44.429
I’ve never been to New Zealand.
How’d she know about that?

763
01:36:44.430 --> 01:36:45.730
What if I need backup?

764
01:36:45.749 --> 01:36:48.110
Get on the radio.
I’ll send in the Marines.

765
01:36:50.454 --> 01:36:52.561
Anyway, hang a left
at the end of the runway.

766
01:36:52.562 --> 01:36:55.095
- Cuba’s 80 miles on your right.
- Yo, Wade.

767
01:36:59.329 --> 01:37:02.555
Just one thing: Don’t push
any of the buttons on that car.

768
01:37:02.556 --> 01:37:06.435
- I was going to go bombing around in it.
- Exactly.

769
01:37:06.436 --> 01:37:11.028
Yo, James, I got faith.
But be careful. He knows you’re coming.

770
01:38:15.806 --> 01:38:18.439
He was your friend, Trevelyan?

771
01:38:20.376 --> 01:38:23.496
And now he’s your enemy
and you will kill him.

772
01:38:25.315 --> 01:38:28.551
It is that simple?

773
01:38:28.552 --> 01:38:31.520
In a word, yes.

774
01:38:31.521 --> 01:38:33.723
Unless he kills you first.

775
01:38:33.724 --> 01:38:36.003
- Natalya--
- You think I’m impressed?

776
01:38:36.004 --> 01:38:39.469
All of you with your guns,
your killing, your death. For what?

777
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:42.028
So you can be a hero?

778
01:38:43.233 --> 01:38:45.629
- All the heroes I know are dead.
- Natalya, listen to me.

779
01:38:45.630 --> 01:38:48.863
How can you act like this?
How can you be so cold?

780
01:38:50.773 --> 01:38:53.133
It’s what keeps me alive.

781
01:38:54.679 --> 01:38:55.650
No.

782
01:38:56.546 --> 01:38:58.562
It’s what keeps you alone.

783
01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:38.815
James?

784
01:39:40.923 --> 01:39:42.417
Yes?

785
01:39:49.398 --> 01:39:52.566
On the train...

786
01:39:52.567 --> 01:39:57.138
when you told him to kill me
and I meant nothing to you...

787
01:39:57.139 --> 01:39:59.156
did you mean it?

788
01:40:01.177 --> 01:40:02.766
Yes.

789
01:40:03.779 --> 01:40:07.492
Basic rule:
always call their bluff.

790
01:40:11.854 --> 01:40:13.348
No.

791
01:40:46.555 --> 01:40:50.824
Turn ten degrees south,
bearing one-eight-four.

792
01:40:50.825 --> 01:40:52.557
Yes, sir.

793
01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:20.337
Nothing.
There is nothing here.

794
01:41:21.524 --> 01:41:23.707
Let’s make another pass.

795
01:41:36.104 --> 01:41:38.987
Maybe Wade was right.
There is no dish.

796
01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:39.260
Natalya.

797
01:43:39.562 --> 01:43:44.603
This time, Mr. Bond,
the pleasure will be all mine.

798
01:44:03.384 --> 01:44:05.459
Wait for your turn.

799
01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:41.790
She always did enjoy
a good squeeze.

800
01:44:52.634 --> 01:44:55.369
Is the satellite in range?

801
01:44:55.370 --> 01:44:57.481
- Six minutes.
- Prepare the dish.

802
01:44:57.482 --> 01:45:01.440
No! It’s too early.
I am not ready.

803
01:45:01.441 --> 01:45:03.066
Do it!

804
01:45:33.340 --> 01:45:35.107
No wonder we couldn’t see it.

805
01:45:45.953 --> 01:45:47.613
Come on.

806
01:46:03.269 --> 01:46:06.081
The world’s greatest cash card.

807
01:46:07.441 --> 01:46:09.552
It had better not be rejected.

808
01:47:13.941 --> 01:47:17.060
- Mischa is on-line.
- Sir.

809
01:47:22.449 --> 01:47:24.550
Kill him!

810
01:47:24.551 --> 01:47:26.733
The man just won’t take a hint.

811
01:47:28.187 --> 01:47:32.315
- Target coordinates?
- The target is London.

812
01:47:44.972 --> 01:47:47.693
He’s getting ready
to signal the satellite.

813
01:47:47.694 --> 01:47:50.794
- How do you stop it?
- The transmitter above the antenna--

814
01:48:22.308 --> 01:48:24.597
Antenna in position.

815
01:48:28.047 --> 01:48:29.600
On my count.

816
01:48:30.749 --> 01:48:33.774
Three... two... one.

817
01:49:02.948 --> 01:49:05.060
God save the Queen.

818
01:49:23.903 --> 01:49:25.970
The mainframe computer.

819
01:49:25.971 --> 01:49:27.287
Don’t move.

820
01:50:53.825 --> 01:50:56.994
James!
What an unpleasant surprise.

821
01:50:56.995 --> 01:50:59.177
- We aim to please.
- Where’s the girl?

822
01:51:00.465 --> 01:51:01.568
Find her!

823
01:51:10.041 --> 01:51:12.843
So, how is old Q?

824
01:51:12.844 --> 01:51:15.112
Up to his usual tricks?

825
01:51:15.113 --> 01:51:16.772
The watch.

826
01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:24.221
A new model.

827
01:51:24.222 --> 01:51:26.724
Still press here, do I?

828
01:51:43.007 --> 01:51:45.642
Interesting setup, Alec.

829
01:51:45.643 --> 01:51:49.046
You break into the Bank of England
via computer...

830
01:51:49.047 --> 01:51:51.871
and then transfer
the money electronically...

831
01:51:51.872 --> 01:51:54.730
just seconds before
you set off the GoldenEye...

832
01:51:54.731 --> 01:51:57.947
which erases any record
of the transactions.

833
01:51:58.923 --> 01:52:01.825
- Ingenious.
- Thank you, James.

834
01:52:01.826 --> 01:52:04.946
But it still boils down
to petty theft.

835
01:52:05.930 --> 01:52:08.565
In the end,
you’re just a bank robber.

836
01:52:08.566 --> 01:52:11.448
Nothing more
than a common thief.

837
01:52:20.878 --> 01:52:23.779
You always did have
a small mind, James.

838
01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:25.922
It’s not just
erasing bank records.

839
01:52:25.923 --> 01:52:28.798
It’s everything on every computer
in Greater London:

840
01:52:28.799 --> 01:52:33.290
tax records, the stock market,
credit ratings, land registries...

841
01:52:33.291 --> 01:52:36.158
criminal records.

842
01:52:36.159 --> 01:52:38.862
In 16 minutes and 43 sec--

843
01:52:38.863 --> 01:52:42.932
No, 42 seconds-- the United Kingdom
will reenter the Stone Age.

844
01:52:42.933 --> 01:52:45.534
A worldwide financial meltdown.

845
01:52:45.535 --> 01:52:50.640
And all so mad little Alec can settle
a score with the world 50 years on.

846
01:52:50.641 --> 01:52:54.277
Oh, please, James.
Spare me the Freud.

847
01:52:54.278 --> 01:52:57.683
I might as well ask you if all the vodka
martinis ever silence the screams...

848
01:52:57.684 --> 01:52:59.557
of all the men you’ve killed.

849
01:53:02.854 --> 01:53:06.223
Or if you find forgiveness in the arms
of all those willing women...

850
01:53:06.224 --> 01:53:09.418
for all the dead ones
you failed to protect.

851
01:53:11.395 --> 01:53:14.930
England is about to learn
the cost of betrayal...

852
01:53:14.931 --> 01:53:17.956
inflation-adjusted for 1945.

853
01:53:20.338 --> 01:53:23.291
- Welcome to the party, my dear.
- Natalya!

854
01:53:57.908 --> 01:54:01.443
Don’t ever do that again!

855
01:54:01.444 --> 01:54:03.663
This is not one of
your games, Boris.

856
01:54:03.664 --> 01:54:07.288
Real people will die!
You pathetic little worm.

857
01:54:09.052 --> 01:54:11.484
She was in the mainframe.
Check the computer.

858
01:54:11.485 --> 01:54:15.724
She’s a moron.
A second-level programmer.

859
01:54:15.725 --> 01:54:19.628
She works on
the guidance system.

860
01:54:19.629 --> 01:54:23.377
She doesn’t even have access
to the firing codes.

861
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:29.230
Retrorockets firing!

862
01:54:46.891 --> 01:54:48.991
What the hell’s happening?

863
01:54:48.992 --> 01:54:52.990
We will have reentry in...
12 minutes!

864
01:54:55.165 --> 01:54:57.940
- It will burn up over the Atlantic.
- Deal with it!

865
01:54:58.802 --> 01:55:01.376
She changed the access codes!

866
01:55:02.272 --> 01:55:04.289
Well, then she can fix it.

867
01:55:07.811 --> 01:55:11.701
Go ahead, shoot him.
He means nothing to me.

868
01:55:12.748 --> 01:55:14.372
I can do it!

869
01:55:14.384 --> 01:55:16.816
- I can break her codes.
- Then get on with it!

870
01:55:45.916 --> 01:55:47.505
Tell him, now!

871
01:55:49.052 --> 01:55:52.907
Give me the codes, Natalya!
Give them to me!

872
01:56:08.637 --> 01:56:11.339
- Can Boris break your codes?
- Possibly.

873
01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:12.835
Possibly?

874
01:56:13.943 --> 01:56:16.377
We have to destroy
the transmitter.

875
01:56:16.378 --> 01:56:20.411
By the way,
I’m fine, thank you very much.

876
01:56:48.011 --> 01:56:49.955
Do you know how
to use one of these?

877
01:56:53.114 --> 01:56:54.811
Yes.

878
01:56:54.817 --> 01:56:57.142
Good.
Stay out of sight.

879
01:57:11.934 --> 01:57:14.402
- How long?
- Two minutes. One minute.

880
01:57:14.403 --> 01:57:16.692
- Guard!
- I’m fixing it!

881
01:57:17.674 --> 01:57:20.271
If he moves, kill him.

882
01:58:42.122 --> 01:58:45.421
Yes! I am invincible!

883
02:00:55.921 --> 02:01:00.264
You know, James...
I was always better.

884
02:01:17.910 --> 02:01:19.404
Alpha One to Gunship.

885
02:01:20.479 --> 02:01:23.052
Alpha One to Gunship!

886
02:02:23.375 --> 02:02:25.486
Speak to me!

887
02:03:00.312 --> 02:03:02.708
For England, James?

888
02:03:03.281 --> 02:03:05.616
No.

889
02:03:05.617 --> 02:03:07.111
For me.

890
02:04:26.297 --> 02:04:28.930
Yes! I am invincible!

891
02:04:53.657 --> 02:04:56.159
James! James!

892
02:04:56.160 --> 02:04:58.177
Are you all right?

893
02:05:01.366 --> 02:05:03.548
Yes, I’m fine, thank you.

894
02:05:13.544 --> 02:05:16.646
Suppose someone is watching?

895
02:05:16.647 --> 02:05:20.016
No. There’s no one
within 25 miles, believe me.

896
02:05:20.951 --> 02:05:22.445
Yo, Jimbo!

897
02:05:32.196 --> 02:05:36.430
Is this supposed to be your idea of, uh,
coming through in a clinch?

898
02:05:38.068 --> 02:05:42.072
It’s tobacco plants.
I said I’d be here, huh?

899
02:05:42.073 --> 02:05:44.149
Yo! Marines!

900
02:05:54.785 --> 02:05:58.662
Maybe you two would like to finish
debriefing each other at Guantanamo.

901
02:06:01.157 --> 02:06:03.482
- You ready?
- I’m not going on a helicopter with you.

902
02:06:03.483 --> 02:06:06.795
No plane, no train,
nothing that moves.

903
02:06:06.796 --> 02:06:10.165
Darling, what could
possible go wrong, eh?
