1
00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:19.666
Let me tell you about
who first seduced us to do evil.

2
00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:25.916
Lucifer,
to set himself in glory,

3
00:00:26.083 --> 00:00:30.625
raised war in heaven against
the throne and monarchy of God.

4
00:00:31.708 --> 00:00:34.125
Defeated by
the archangel Michael,

5
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:38.375
this fallen angel was cast
headlong into the lower realm.

6
00:00:50.458 --> 00:00:53.125
Flaming as he fell through
the ethereal sky.

7
00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:03.625
Down to bottomless damnation.

8
00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:10.250
There to dwell
in unbreakable chains.

9
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:14.000
And punishing fire.

10
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.541
Shit.

11
00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:41.250
Lucifer!

12
00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:02.500
Is this really necessary?

13
00:02:09.916 --> 00:02:11.708
Unchain me!

14
00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:13.750
Michael!

15
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.208
Return as my ally and devoted
angel of the kingdom.

16
00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:21.708
Better to reign in hell
than serve in heaven.

17
00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:26.166
Michael!

18
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.541
I will one day shake free
and rise from these ashes.

19
00:02:31.708 --> 00:02:34.916
I will return to you
but not as your ally,

20
00:02:35.083 --> 00:02:36.375
nor your brother.

21
00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:39.333
I shall return to you
as your master,

22
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.833
your creator, your God!

23
00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.833
Over time,

24
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.083
legions of demons
joined Lucifer in hell

25
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.458
as he plots his revenge.

26
00:03:40.041 --> 00:03:43.041
On Earth, his disciples
erect a stronghold

27
00:03:43.208 --> 00:03:46.458
to guard where Lucifer fell,
believing one day

28
00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:49.458
he will rise through
this gateway to hell.

29
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:54.041
And rule our world.

30
00:04:23.541 --> 00:04:24.541
Professor Russo!

31
00:04:27.916 --> 00:04:29.125
Yes, Laura?

32
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:32.041
Please reconsider
approving my thesis.

33
00:04:32.208 --> 00:04:33.750
The last thing
the Turin University

34
00:04:33.916 --> 00:04:36.208
wants to hear is
a young American lecturing us

35
00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:38.458
on what our great
Italian artists believed

36
00:04:38.625 --> 00:04:39.666
or didn't believe.

37
00:04:39.833 --> 00:04:41.333
I'm simply saying
that the artists

38
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.791
who filled your cathedrals
with angels and devils

39
00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.833
knew they weren't real,
you know.

40
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.708
Like no actual good spirits
from above

41
00:04:47.875 --> 00:04:50.250
or evil spirits from below.

42
00:04:50.416 --> 00:04:52.166
There is no dark side.

43
00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:54.666
- No dark side?
- Yeah.

44
00:04:54.833 --> 00:04:56.791
Your thesis makes
for a boring movie

45
00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.875
and an arrogant dissertation.

46
00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:00.375
The answer is no.

47
00:05:00.541 --> 00:05:02.875
Please, Dr. Russo,
can't we discuss this?

48
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.500
Why don't we discuss it later
at my apartment?

49
00:05:11.791 --> 00:05:15.083
I prefer crowded large
open spaces.

50
00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:18.566
Is that why you wear
a wedding band?

51
00:05:18.708 --> 00:05:20.958
To keep us Italian men at bay?

52
00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:22.750
It's obviously not working.

53
00:05:26.916 --> 00:05:29.625
The DNA of Jesus of Nazareth
will be on display this week

54
00:05:29.791 --> 00:05:31.500
in Turin, Italy.

55
00:05:31.666 --> 00:05:33.458
Hundreds of thousands
will flock to witness

56
00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:35.833
this historic event
as the Shroud of Turin,

57
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.208
the burial cloth of Jesus,
is unveiled.

58
00:05:38.375 --> 00:05:39.935
Accompanying the Shroud
will be renowned

59
00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:41.750
art work and sculptures
provided by the

60
00:05:41.916 --> 00:05:43.541
Vatican Historical Society.

61
00:05:43.708 --> 00:05:44.708
Thanks again.

62
00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:45.892
Thank you for coming to church.

63
00:05:45.916 --> 00:05:46.958
- Thank you.
- Ciao.

64
00:05:47.125 --> 00:05:47.666
- Yes, thank you.
- Ciao, thank you.

65
00:05:47.833 --> 00:05:48.833
Thank you.

66
00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:51.125
- Laura.
- Hey.

67
00:05:51.291 --> 00:05:53.083
- How's my art historian?
- Good.

68
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.250
Wonderful.

69
00:05:54.291 --> 00:05:55.331
You won't be disappointed.

70
00:05:55.416 --> 00:05:56.625
Here, you'll need this today.

71
00:05:56.791 --> 00:05:57.458
Added security
for the exhibition.

72
00:05:57.625 --> 00:06:00.083
Oh, nice.

73
00:06:01.458 --> 00:06:03.458
Everyone is very excited.

74
00:06:03.625 --> 00:06:05.385
There's only been
five showings of the Shroud

75
00:06:05.416 --> 00:06:06.416
in the last 100 years.

76
00:06:06.541 --> 00:06:07.750
Yeah, good crowd.

77
00:06:07.916 --> 00:06:09.291
Ooh, sorry.

78
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:12.833
Thank you.

79
00:06:17.416 --> 00:06:20.708
Welcome to the exhibition
of the Shroud of Christ.

80
00:06:20.875 --> 00:06:24.541
The world's most famous object
and most sacred.

81
00:06:24.708 --> 00:06:26.250
Can you come here, please?

82
00:06:26.416 --> 00:06:27.736
Before we go in
to see the Shroud,

83
00:06:29.375 --> 00:06:30.601
I want to show you all
the images up close,

84
00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:31.865
so that you get a better idea of

85
00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.291
what they look like.

86
00:06:33.458 --> 00:06:35.625
So here we have Christ's blood

87
00:06:35.791 --> 00:06:37.625
from His crucifixion.

88
00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:40.416
His image from the resurrection.

89
00:06:40.583 --> 00:06:43.833
We believe that Jesus died,
was buried,

90
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.040
and descended to the dead.

91
00:06:45.166 --> 00:06:47.250
On the third day, he rose.

92
00:06:47.416 --> 00:06:49.291
Intense bright light
emitted from his body

93
00:06:49.458 --> 00:06:51.000
imprinted His image
on the Shroud.

94
00:06:52.458 --> 00:06:55.000
The Shroud is a photograph
of the resurrection.

95
00:06:56.375 --> 00:06:57.375
Hmm.

96
00:06:58.541 --> 00:07:00.184
Didn't you say
you wanted to show me something?

97
00:07:00.208 --> 00:07:01.208
I do.

98
00:07:01.333 --> 00:07:02.125
Something very special.

99
00:07:02.291 --> 00:07:03.375
Just this way.

100
00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:06.833
See, I believe that art tells

101
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.750
the story of our past
and hints at our future.

102
00:07:15.041 --> 00:07:16.791
It's on loan for the exhibit.

103
00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.416
He's here to protect the Shroud.

104
00:07:20.375 --> 00:07:22.708
Saint Michael defeating
the devil.

105
00:07:23.625 --> 00:07:26.458
The war of angels
was the first war

106
00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:28.875
and the first evil.

107
00:07:29.041 --> 00:07:30.958
Thankfully,
Michael defeated Lucifer

108
00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:32.291
and bound him in hell.

109
00:07:33.875 --> 00:07:35.541
But the struggle
of good versus evil

110
00:07:35.708 --> 00:07:36.908
continues on within each of us.

111
00:07:37.041 --> 00:07:38.458
Exactly.

112
00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:42.583
Evil is not some external,
mystical force.

113
00:07:44.625 --> 00:07:45.625
It's personal.

114
00:07:46.583 --> 00:07:48.291
I disagree.

115
00:07:48.458 --> 00:07:49.833
It's much more than that.

116
00:07:51.083 --> 00:07:53.125
This artist insisted that
the devil himself

117
00:07:53.291 --> 00:07:54.500
sat for his portrait.

118
00:07:55.833 --> 00:07:57.250
I think he may be right.

119
00:07:59.916 --> 00:08:02.625
I know of many good people
who have endured

120
00:08:02.791 --> 00:08:03.791
horrendous evil.

121
00:08:04.916 --> 00:08:05.958
Other-worldly evil.

122
00:08:06.125 --> 00:08:08.583
Yeah, so do I.

123
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.958
But when something happens
to someone we deeply love,

124
00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:15.500
blaming it on the devil
doesn't fix anything.

125
00:08:15.666 --> 00:08:17.833
It certainly doesn't
reduce the pain.

126
00:08:19.458 --> 00:08:21.058
It's the only way
I can make sense of it.

127
00:08:22.541 --> 00:08:25.000
The war in heaven
has come to Earth.

128
00:08:25.166 --> 00:08:26.375
The devil never rests.

129
00:08:34.833 --> 00:08:36.458
Lucifer would have
consumed us all

130
00:08:36.625 --> 00:08:38.416
if Michael hadn't stopped him.

131
00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:46.250
Many prophecies
of the devil returning to Earth

132
00:08:46.416 --> 00:08:48.083
as a false god.

133
00:08:50.708 --> 00:08:52.250
I pray he never
finds his way out.

134
00:08:54.416 --> 00:08:57.375
But I must find my way out.

135
00:08:59.125 --> 00:09:01.458
May I leave you three alone
to get acquainted?

136
00:09:01.625 --> 00:09:02.750
Sure.

137
00:09:02.916 --> 00:09:04.125
Thank you, Father.

138
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:05.291
Enjoy.

139
00:09:36.666 --> 00:09:38.333
Laura.

140
00:09:46.166 --> 00:09:47.708
Father?

141
00:10:14.083 --> 00:10:15.375
Just in time.

142
00:10:17.208 --> 00:10:19.791
Several fires
have nearly consumed

143
00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.791
the Shroud.

144
00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.291
The last all but destroyed
this Cathedral.

145
00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:25.708
God saved it.

146
00:10:26.875 --> 00:10:27.916
Follow me, please.

147
00:10:28.083 --> 00:10:29.958
We will go upstairs.

148
00:10:57.875 --> 00:10:59.208
Goodbye. Thank you.

149
00:11:00.666 --> 00:11:02.000
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

150
00:12:43.333 --> 00:12:44.333
Go!

151
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:46.250
Shoo!

152
00:12:48.208 --> 00:12:49.208
Go!

153
00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:52.041
Go!

154
00:12:53.833 --> 00:12:54.833
Go!

155
00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:57.250
Go!

156
00:13:13.625 --> 00:13:14.708
Oh my God.

157
00:13:26.125 --> 00:13:27.125
Uh, no, no.

158
00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.708
Ah, badge, yes.

159
00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.500
Stop.

160
00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:00.333
Stop this at once.

161
00:16:05.208 --> 00:16:06.583
Stop this desecration.

162
00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:09.208
Holy Michael.

163
00:16:09.375 --> 00:16:11.041
Be our defense
against the devil.

164
00:16:12.583 --> 00:16:13.583
Rebuke him!

165
00:16:14.666 --> 00:16:15.666
No!

166
00:16:19.041 --> 00:16:20.166
No.

167
00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.375
Keep Satan in hell
and all his evil spirits

168
00:16:26.541 --> 00:16:28.458
who desire the ruin of souls.

169
00:16:29.875 --> 00:16:32.333
Join us here on Earth, Lucifer!

170
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.041
Saint Michael,
return to us I pray.

171
00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:17.208
Take it.

172
00:17:39.541 --> 00:17:40.541
Stop.

173
00:17:40.666 --> 00:17:42.333
Don't kill her.

174
00:17:43.791 --> 00:17:46.041
He might choose her.

175
00:17:46.208 --> 00:17:46.958
No.

176
00:17:47.125 --> 00:17:48.291
No, don't touch me.

177
00:17:50.166 --> 00:17:51.250
Where are you taking me?

178
00:17:51.416 --> 00:17:52.958
No, please.

179
00:18:00.125 --> 00:18:01.125
Saint Michael...

180
00:18:02.625 --> 00:18:04.583
take my body.

181
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.750
Use it to defeat
this beast of Satan.

182
00:18:35.708 --> 00:18:36.708
Help me!

183
00:18:36.791 --> 00:18:38.500
Keep her quiet.

184
00:18:38.666 --> 00:18:40.125
Help!

185
00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:41.875
Who are you people?

186
00:18:43.041 --> 00:18:44.166
No.

187
00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:46.583
Michael.

188
00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:47.875
Kill him.

189
00:19:13.416 --> 00:19:14.541
Faster!

190
00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:30.625
Thank you all for coming.

191
00:20:34.208 --> 00:20:36.250
My name is Dr. Laurent.

192
00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:41.375
To resurrect brilliance,
my colleagues visited

193
00:20:41.541 --> 00:20:45.583
Santa Croce,
final resting place for

194
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:50.291
Machiavelli, Galileo, Michelangelo.

195
00:20:52.458 --> 00:20:56.500
This Fort Knox of genetic
genius stores treasure

196
00:20:56.666 --> 00:20:58.500
much more valuable than gold.

197
00:20:59.333 --> 00:21:03.375
Brilliant DNA, which until now

198
00:21:03.541 --> 00:21:05.250
was a puzzle that
could not be solved.

199
00:21:06.666 --> 00:21:14.666
Today, I alone can bring
these dry old bones to life.

200
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:16.750
The result?

201
00:21:18.166 --> 00:21:21.958
Children you can
honestly be proud of.

202
00:21:25.958 --> 00:21:29.750
The past will become our future.

203
00:21:29.916 --> 00:21:34.750
Once I resurrect history's
most influential people

204
00:21:34.916 --> 00:21:38.875
from the dead,
I just need you to pay for it.

205
00:21:42.125 --> 00:21:46.500
Ladies and gentlemen,
the risen Antonio Vivaldi.

206
00:21:53.791 --> 00:21:55.333
And his proud parents.

207
00:21:56.958 --> 00:21:58.875
Congratulations.

208
00:21:59.041 --> 00:22:00.708
Thank you. Thank you so much.

209
00:22:02.875 --> 00:22:05.250
Next up for bid.

210
00:22:05.416 --> 00:22:09.250
One of the greatest poets
and architects.

211
00:22:09.416 --> 00:22:11.708
Considered to be
the greatest sculptor

212
00:22:11.875 --> 00:22:14.500
and draftsman, living or dead.

213
00:22:14.666 --> 00:22:16.583
The creator of
the Sistine Chapel,

214
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.875
the David,
Saint Peter's Basilica

215

and the Pieta.

216
00:22:20.708 --> 00:22:26.041
Tonight, prize possession,
Michelangelo Buonarroti.

217
00:22:40.083 --> 00:22:43.958
So we start the bidding tonight
at e10 million.

218
00:22:45.083 --> 00:22:48.083
And there we have it,
just like that, 15 million.

219
00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:49.583
20 million.

220
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:50.750
30 million.

221
00:22:50.916 --> 00:22:52.083
Any advance on 30?

222
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:53.583
E40 million.

223
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:54.750
70.

224
00:22:54.916 --> 00:22:57.458
E70 million.

225
00:22:57.625 --> 00:23:00.541
Any advance on e70 million?

226
00:23:00.708 --> 00:23:01.708
80 million.

227
00:23:03.333 --> 00:23:06.291
80 million,
and 80 million going once.

228
00:23:06.458 --> 00:23:08.041
Going twice.

229
00:23:08.208 --> 00:23:09.708
90 million.

230
00:23:53.125 --> 00:23:54.125
Is the Shroud ready yet?

231
00:23:54.208 --> 00:23:55.458
- Yes.
- Good.

232
00:24:03.666 --> 00:24:07.500
Everything I have worked for
has been for this moment.

233
00:24:08.958 --> 00:24:10.916
Prepare the surrogates.

234
00:24:11.083 --> 00:24:13.250
He's waited long enough.

235
00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:22.000
Lucifer will finally have
a worthy home.

236
00:24:31.916 --> 00:24:34.375
Please make her stop.
Please, now.

237
00:24:34.541 --> 00:24:35.791
Make her stop.

238
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.791
Hey, shhh. Hey.

239
00:24:38.958 --> 00:24:40.458
Hey, Sophia. Shut up.

240
00:24:43.958 --> 00:24:45.125
They're watching us.

241
00:24:46.208 --> 00:24:47.208
Where am I?

242
00:24:48.875 --> 00:24:49.875
Hell.

243
00:24:51.291 --> 00:24:52.833
What?

244
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.291
Hey, where did they
get you from?

245
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.458
Um, the Cathedral?

246
00:25:00.625 --> 00:25:01.291
Cathedral?

247
00:25:01.458 --> 00:25:03.000
You're a nun?

248
00:25:03.875 --> 00:25:04.875
Shut up.

249
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.625
Shut up! Shut up!

250
00:25:10.666 --> 00:25:12.291
Can you make her stop, please?

251
00:25:12.458 --> 00:25:13.875
Hey, be quiet, be quiet.

252
00:25:14.041 --> 00:25:15.458
Listen, listen,
what's your name?

253
00:25:16.833 --> 00:25:17.958
Sophia. Sophia.

254
00:25:18.125 --> 00:25:18.916
She speaks English.

255
00:25:19.083 --> 00:25:20.458
Okay, okay. Okay.

256
00:25:20.625 --> 00:25:21.958
Sophia, Sophia.

257
00:25:22.125 --> 00:25:23.125
Hi, I'm Laura.

258
00:25:24.125 --> 00:25:24.916
Okay, Sophia, look at me.

259
00:25:25.083 --> 00:25:26.083
Look at me.

260
00:25:26.166 --> 00:25:27.458
You want to get out of here?

261
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.875
- Yeah?
- Yes. Yes.

262
00:25:32.041 --> 00:25:33.458
Yeah, so do I.

263
00:25:34.625 --> 00:25:35.958
Okay.

264
00:25:36.125 --> 00:25:37.583
Okay, so what we're gonna do?

265
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:38.333
What's your name?

266
00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.208
It's Brenda.

267
00:25:39.375 --> 00:25:40.833
- Brenda?
- Yeah.

268
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.375
What's your name?

269
00:25:43.125 --> 00:25:45.000
- Alina.
- Alina.

270
00:25:45.166 --> 00:25:47.250
We're gonna have to stay calm

271
00:25:47.416 --> 00:25:48.892
and we're gonna
have to work together.

272
00:25:48.916 --> 00:25:50.250
All of us.

273
00:25:50.416 --> 00:25:51.416
Yes.

274
00:26:03.583 --> 00:26:05.208
No, no, no,
don't you come near me.

275
00:26:05.375 --> 00:26:06.541
Don't touch me!

276
00:26:06.708 --> 00:26:07.708
No!

277
00:26:09.333 --> 00:26:10.333
Get away.

278
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:19.500
Off me.

279
00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:42.250
No, no.

280
00:26:42.291 --> 00:26:43.416
Bishop Bustamante is safe.

281
00:26:45.291 --> 00:26:46.291
They're on their way.

282
00:27:07.875 --> 00:27:09.416
Father Marconi.

283
00:27:10.958 --> 00:27:12.250
How could you?

284
00:27:13.416 --> 00:27:14.750
- My God.
- Oh.

285
00:27:14.916 --> 00:27:15.583
How could you let them take it?

286
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:16.958
Father Marconi.

287
00:27:17.125 --> 00:27:18.166
It's a miracle.

288
00:27:18.333 --> 00:27:19.125
Oh, you're bleeding.

289
00:27:19.291 --> 00:27:20.958
I'm calling an ambulance.

290
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:22.750
Don't bother.

291
00:27:24.166 --> 00:27:26.000
Where were the protectors
of the Shroud?

292
00:27:26.166 --> 00:27:27.500
Sorry? Protectors of...

293
00:27:27.666 --> 00:27:29.458
Where were the protectors
of the Shroud?

294
00:27:31.875 --> 00:27:33.583
Ah, my head.

295
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:37.333
Cardinal Vincini was
charged with its protection.

296
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.916
But he became to be unstable.

297
00:27:41.083 --> 00:27:42.458
Unstable?

298
00:27:42.625 --> 00:27:46.208
Prophecies of demonic beasts
and secret cults.

299
00:27:46.375 --> 00:27:47.750
What?

300
00:27:48.958 --> 00:27:51.250
Wild visions of the devil
coming to Earth

301
00:27:51.416 --> 00:27:54.083
and obvious dementia.

302
00:27:55.458 --> 00:27:56.625
Have you read the Bible?

303
00:27:57.666 --> 00:28:00.500
Pardon me? Yes.

304
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.458
He's taking security footage.

305
00:28:04.625 --> 00:28:05.945
Where can I find
Cardinal Vincini?

306
00:28:06.041 --> 00:28:07.250
Father Marconi.

307
00:28:07.416 --> 00:28:08.000
As your superior,
I insist that you...

308
00:28:08.166 --> 00:28:09.250
My superior?

309
00:28:09.416 --> 00:28:11.125
Where is Vincini?

310
00:28:12.166 --> 00:28:13.416
Where?

311
00:28:16.125 --> 00:28:17.458
He is a hermit now.

312
00:28:17.625 --> 00:28:21.666
He's living alone
in Saint Michael's Asylum.

313
00:28:29.333 --> 00:28:30.333
Who is this girl?

314
00:28:34.375 --> 00:28:36.625
She... she's a friend of...

315
00:28:38.833 --> 00:28:40.333
Friend of yours.

316
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.583
Laura is an arts student
from America.

317
00:28:45.333 --> 00:28:47.250
Well, listen to me.

318
00:28:47.416 --> 00:28:48.750
This is very important.

319
00:28:48.916 --> 00:28:50.434
Do not tell a soul
that I have been here.

320
00:28:50.458 --> 00:28:51.208
- Yes.
- No.

321
00:28:51.375 --> 00:28:52.541
Yes, of course not.

322
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.958
By the way, who are you?

323
00:28:57.125 --> 00:28:58.125
Exactly.

324
00:28:59.416 --> 00:29:00.041
Now, there's something else.

325
00:29:00.208 --> 00:29:01.541
I need a car.

326
00:29:01.708 --> 00:29:03.041
You have a car.

327
00:29:04.625 --> 00:29:05.625
I have a car.

328
00:29:05.791 --> 00:29:06.583
Wait.

329
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:08.166
What about the police?

330
00:29:08.333 --> 00:29:10.166
They would want
the missing footage.

331
00:29:10.333 --> 00:29:13.291
Tell them a priest stole it
after a demonic woman killed him

332
00:29:13.458 --> 00:29:15.083
and he came back to life.

333
00:29:16.041 --> 00:29:17.250
Or make something up.

334
00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.851
You don't want to get
sent to Saint Michael's Asylum

335
00:29:19.875 --> 00:29:21.375
for telling the truth now,
do you?

336
00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:24.833
Do you mind?

337
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.041
No, please.

338
00:29:47.208 --> 00:29:48.208

Easy, old man.

359
00:32:47.958 --> 00:32:49.416
I come in peace.

360
00:32:54.541 --> 00:32:55.666
You from Turin?

361
00:32:57.333 --> 00:32:59.125
Did Bustamante send you?

362
00:33:00.625 --> 00:33:02.708
Come to make your confession?

363
00:33:02.875 --> 00:33:04.125
Excuse me?

364
00:33:04.458 --> 00:33:07.208
For the sin of
not protecting the innocent.

365
00:33:08.666 --> 00:33:12.166
For your indifference
to the sufferings of

366
00:33:12.333 --> 00:33:14.000
the children of God.

367
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.708
I warned you fools for years.

368
00:33:17.875 --> 00:33:20.375
But you all thought
I'd lost my mind.

369
00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:23.500
You still think this collar
gives you protection?

370
00:33:31.458 --> 00:33:33.208
You're no priest.

371
00:33:36.583 --> 00:33:37.708
Who are you?

372
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.041
The hound of heaven.

373
00:33:43.208 --> 00:33:44.375
Michael.

374
00:33:46.125 --> 00:33:48.000
Why are you here?

375
00:33:48.166 --> 00:33:50.083
They stole the Shroud.

376
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.541
I have the surveillance footage
from the Cathedral.

377
00:33:55.708 --> 00:33:57.375
Was it a woman?

378
00:33:57.541 --> 00:33:58.583
An old woman?

379
00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:00.416
Yes, it was.

380
00:34:02.625 --> 00:34:03.750
Where is she?

381
00:34:06.083 --> 00:34:08.458
This asylum was built
as a lookout.

382
00:34:10.083 --> 00:34:13.250
Over here. Look.
Come here.

383
00:34:14.583 --> 00:34:15.583
See.

384
00:34:17.166 --> 00:34:19.416
You remember where Lucifer fell?

385
00:34:20.875 --> 00:34:23.250
Look. See.

386
00:34:26.458 --> 00:34:31.375
Those who guard it
work for Lucifer's release.

387
00:34:31.541 --> 00:34:34.750
Don't call that devil
by his angelic name.

388
00:34:36.458 --> 00:34:37.625
He can't escape.

389
00:34:38.625 --> 00:34:39.958
I chained him there.

390
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:44.916
Come with me.

391
00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:47.291
Scripture tells us the devil
will be shaken loose

392
00:34:47.458 --> 00:34:48.541
from his chains.

393
00:34:48.708 --> 00:34:50.083
The gate to hell will be opened.

394
00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:52.375
And he and his demons
will come to Earth.

395
00:34:54.916 --> 00:34:57.208
Now is that time.

396
00:35:03.916 --> 00:35:08.125
Two ancient beasts
who are of both worlds

397
00:35:08.291 --> 00:35:10.166
have been charged
with his release.

398
00:35:11.625 --> 00:35:14.875
The woman, whom you've met.

399
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.375
And the beast of the ground.

400
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:24.017
The only beast that
Satan allowed to come to Earth

401
00:35:24.041 --> 00:35:25.041
before him.

402
00:35:26.916 --> 00:35:28.956
There is nothing he wants more
than to fight his way

403
00:35:29.041 --> 00:35:29.625
out of hell.

404
00:35:29.791 --> 00:35:30.958
I know that.

405
00:35:31.125 --> 00:35:32.833
I put him there.

406
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.208
And only I can free him.

407
00:35:35.375 --> 00:35:37.083
You mean God?

408
00:35:43.083 --> 00:35:47.833
These scrolls are from
the occult that guards the gate.

409
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:52.000
They believe their Lord,
like Jesus,

410
00:35:52.166 --> 00:35:54.750
would be born from innocence.

411
00:35:54.916 --> 00:35:58.541
For centuries, they offered him
children for him to possess.

412
00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:02.541
No! No!

413
00:36:02.708 --> 00:36:04.267
Their young bodies
were not strong enough

414
00:36:04.291 --> 00:36:05.375
to contain him.

415
00:36:05.541 --> 00:36:06.833
Their suffering was unspeakable.

416
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.458
And we did nothing.

417
00:36:08.625 --> 00:36:11.625
The devil can't control
his pride or his rage.

418
00:36:11.791 --> 00:36:14.583
Therefore, he cannot possess
a mortal body.

419
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:15.458
He'd destroy it.

420
00:36:15.625 --> 00:36:16.666
Not any.

421
00:36:17.916 --> 00:36:22.875
There is one body
that has held an eternal.

422
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:25.416
And now science
has given the devil

423
00:36:25.583 --> 00:36:27.208
his way out of hell.

424
00:36:27.375 --> 00:36:29.455
Not even my brother will dare
to inhabit such a body.

425
00:36:29.583 --> 00:36:31.333
Don't you see?

426
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.291
It's why they stole the Shroud.

427
00:36:33.458 --> 00:36:34.500
They needed DNA.

428
00:36:34.666 --> 00:36:36.416
God would never allow it.

429
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:42.291
Isn't that why He sent you?

430
00:36:46.083 --> 00:36:47.791
God didn't send me.

431
00:36:50.375 --> 00:36:52.750
Now get me to that stronghold.

432
00:36:52.916 --> 00:36:54.041
Keep watch.

433
00:36:54.208 --> 00:36:56.291
I'll see to his destruction.

434
00:37:04.791 --> 00:37:06.041
Sharpen it more.

435
00:37:11.125 --> 00:37:12.958
Find anything?

436
00:37:13.125 --> 00:37:14.458
I don't need anything.

437
00:37:14.625 --> 00:37:16.291
Why do you think they need us?

438
00:37:18.041 --> 00:37:19.041
Sex.

439
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:22.750
It's always sex.

440
00:37:22.916 --> 00:37:24.166
And then they'll kill us.

441
00:37:25.333 --> 00:37:27.458
No, fear gets us killed.

442
00:37:28.291 --> 00:37:29.500
I know, okay?

443
00:37:29.666 --> 00:37:31.186
I've had to fight before
to stay alive.

444
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000
So find a weapon.

445
00:37:37.291 --> 00:37:39.125
Are you married?

446
00:37:42.958 --> 00:37:44.750
My husband and child
were murdered.

447
00:37:47.208 --> 00:37:48.625
I'm sorry.

448
00:37:48.791 --> 00:37:50.125
It's okay.

449
00:37:55.916 --> 00:37:57.333
We're gonna be fine, right?

450
00:37:58.375 --> 00:37:59.416
Yup.

451
00:37:59.583 --> 00:38:00.958
No.

452
00:38:05.916 --> 00:38:08.000
At the current exhibition
of the Shroud of Turin,

453
00:38:08.166 --> 00:38:10.083
already attracting
over 2 million visitors,

454
00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:11.750
was abruptly closed today.

455
00:38:11.916 --> 00:38:13.958
The spokesperson
for the Archdiocese of Turin

456
00:38:14.125 --> 00:38:15.833
provided no official comment.

457
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Sources within the Vatican,
however, did indicate

458
00:38:18.166 --> 00:38:20.041
the shocking possibility
that the Shroud itself

459
00:38:20.208 --> 00:38:21.291
has gone missing.

460
00:38:52.458 --> 00:38:55.500
Oh, yes. Right.

461
00:39:27.166 --> 00:39:28.375
DNA's complete.

462
00:39:31.208 --> 00:39:32.708
The girl from the Cathedral.

463
00:39:32.875 --> 00:39:34.333
Yes.

464
00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.708
Blood type matches.

465
00:39:35.875 --> 00:39:37.125
Healthy.

466
00:39:37.291 --> 00:39:39.916
Even her natural cycle
is fortuitous.

467
00:39:40.083 --> 00:39:41.416
Prepare her as well.

468
00:39:42.833 --> 00:39:44.125
Hurry.

469
00:39:44.291 --> 00:39:46.500
I can sense the hound sniffing.

470
00:39:52.125 --> 00:39:53.291
Ready?

471
00:40:24.583 --> 00:40:25.583
Hey.

472
00:40:42.583 --> 00:40:43.583
No!

473
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.208
No!

474
00:41:19.375 --> 00:41:20.875
No! No!

475
00:41:23.375 --> 00:41:25.208
Get your fucking hands off me!

476
00:41:49.125 --> 00:41:50.125
No.

477
00:41:51.166 --> 00:41:53.791
Calm yourself down.

478
00:41:53.958 --> 00:41:55.458
Who the hell are you?

479
00:41:56.333 --> 00:41:59.166
I'm the angel of the Lord.

480
00:41:59.333 --> 00:42:00.833
Call me, "Liz".

481
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.750
What are you doing to me?

482
00:42:02.916 --> 00:42:04.833
We're implanting

483
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.750
a fertilized egg
into your uterus.

484
00:42:12.041 --> 00:42:13.041
You sick fucking bitch!

485
00:42:16.458 --> 00:42:19.791
It's a very important baby.

486
00:42:19.958 --> 00:42:23.166
Please, please stop now.

487
00:42:23.333 --> 00:42:24.541
Please.

488
00:42:24.708 --> 00:42:28.208
When I first saw you
in the Cathedral,

489
00:42:29.166 --> 00:42:35.333
your sketch of my Lucifer
was so inspired.

490
00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:41.458
I have never seen him
captured like that.

491
00:42:44.375 --> 00:42:49.541
And it's why I believe
you might be the one.

492
00:43:03.958 --> 00:43:04.625
Is this where we part?

493
00:43:04.791 --> 00:43:05.791
It is.

494
00:43:09.958 --> 00:43:11.625
Following us since we left.

495
00:43:13.875 --> 00:43:16.333
To light the darkness,
some flares.

496
00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:17.791
You have the torch.

497
00:43:18.916 --> 00:43:21.041
Be watchful.

498
00:43:21.208 --> 00:43:23.500
The beast of the ground
dwells below.

499
00:43:25.166 --> 00:43:27.083
We have lost many to his claws.

500
00:43:28.791 --> 00:43:29.958
This won't kill him.

501
00:43:31.208 --> 00:43:33.125
But it will slow him down.

502
00:43:39.458 --> 00:43:40.958
May God be with you.

503
00:43:44.125 --> 00:43:46.750
Is God with you?

504
00:43:47.916 --> 00:43:49.458
This is my responsibility.

505
00:43:50.875 --> 00:43:52.375
I'll ask for permission later.

506
00:44:42.541 --> 00:44:43.541
No.

507
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:55.750
Help. No, please. Please.

508
00:44:55.916 --> 00:44:57.166
Help us!

509
00:44:58.791 --> 00:44:59.958
Please.

510
00:45:04.041 --> 00:45:05.041
Help me!

511
00:45:38.083 --> 00:45:39.083
What is it?

512
00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:49.708
Oh God. Oh God, oh.

513
00:46:03.625 --> 00:46:06.625
Brenda. Stop it!

514
00:46:06.791 --> 00:46:07.916
Stop!

515
00:46:25.875 --> 00:46:27.291
No!

516
00:46:34.333 --> 00:46:36.000
Help me!

517
00:46:36.166 --> 00:46:39.375
May the holy mother be found.

518
00:47:04.375 --> 00:47:06.625
No! I said, no!

519
00:47:06.791 --> 00:47:08.416
Open the door!

520
00:47:09.708 --> 00:47:10.458
Open the door!

521
00:47:10.625 --> 00:47:11.625
Open it!

522
00:47:19.458 --> 00:47:23.208
Someone help me!
No! No!

523
00:47:23.375 --> 00:47:24.708
Oh my God.

524
00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:26.458
What the fuck are you doing?

525
00:47:26.625 --> 00:47:27.875
Oh my God.

526
00:47:31.958 --> 00:47:32.958
What is it?

527
00:47:35.708 --> 00:47:38.666
No! No!

528
00:47:38.833 --> 00:47:40.583
No, let us out!

529
00:47:41.791 --> 00:47:44.583
Please, please, stop!

530
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:46.541
- Stop!
- Stop!

531
00:47:46.708 --> 00:47:47.708
No!

532
00:47:48.916 --> 00:47:50.083
Let us out!

533
00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:51.750
- Stop!
- Stop!

534
00:47:54.375 --> 00:47:56.958
No!

535
00:48:47.375 --> 00:48:48.500
What is this?

536
00:48:48.666 --> 00:48:50.041
Did you hear that?

537
00:48:52.125 --> 00:48:53.375
What is it?

538
00:48:53.541 --> 00:48:55.125
What's that noise?

539
00:48:58.208 --> 00:48:59.666
What's there?

540
00:49:01.291 --> 00:49:03.125
What the fuck is that?

541
00:49:05.875 --> 00:49:07.416
Do you... do you see anything?

542
00:49:15.458 --> 00:49:17.625
No! No!

543
00:49:24.958 --> 00:49:26.750
We're gonna die here.

544
00:49:29.833 --> 00:49:31.541
Ah, no!

545
00:49:33.833 --> 00:49:35.208
No!

546
00:49:49.916 --> 00:49:50.916
Brenda!

547
00:50:12.916 --> 00:50:15.500
Help me.

548
00:50:17.291 --> 00:50:18.708
Brenda.
Brenda.

549
00:50:32.416 --> 00:50:34.666
No. No!

550
00:52:16.083 --> 00:52:18.125
The chosen one!

551
00:52:49.208 --> 00:52:53.166
You've found favor
and will bring forth a son.

552
00:52:58.791 --> 00:53:00.833
What's in me?

553
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.916
A new Jesus.

554
00:53:03.916 --> 00:53:04.916
What?

555
00:53:05.291 --> 00:53:07.500
A better Jesus.

556
00:54:46.583 --> 00:54:48.583
Put it down.

557
00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:49.875
Put it down! Put it down.

558
00:56:12.541 --> 00:56:13.291
Excuse me.

559
00:56:13.458 --> 00:56:14.250
What are you doing here?

560
00:56:14.416 --> 00:56:15.833
Nobody's allowed in...

561
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.041
No, what have you done?
What have you done?

562
00:56:19.291 --> 00:56:21.083
Why did you take the Shroud?

563
00:56:21.250 --> 00:56:22.916
Who are you?

564
00:56:23.083 --> 00:56:24.250
Why?

565
00:56:25.958 --> 00:56:28.833
A new beginning.

566
00:56:36.375 --> 00:56:37.833
No. Don't take...

567
00:56:39.083 --> 00:56:40.750
No.

568
00:56:52.416 --> 00:56:53.416
That's him! There!

569
00:56:54.333 --> 00:56:55.333
You guys smell that?

570
00:56:57.458 --> 00:56:59.125
It smells like smoke
or something.

571
00:57:08.083 --> 00:57:09.750
Is that a fire?

572
00:57:09.916 --> 00:57:12.076
Oh, don't just stand there,
we need to get out of here.

573
00:57:19.791 --> 00:57:21.708
Father Marconi?

574
00:57:21.875 --> 00:57:23.666
Oh my God!

575
00:57:25.125 --> 00:57:27.666
I thought you died.

576
00:57:27.833 --> 00:57:29.208
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

577
00:57:29.375 --> 00:57:30.517
We need to get you out of here.

578
00:57:30.541 --> 00:57:31.708
Michael.

579
00:57:31.875 --> 00:57:35.375
Yes. Yes, come on, let's go.
Come on.

580
00:57:35.541 --> 00:57:36.291
What's the matter?

581
00:57:36.458 --> 00:57:38.125
- Brother.
- What?

582
00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:40.642
Come on, let's get out of here.

583
00:57:40.666 --> 00:57:42.208
Something's not right.

584
00:57:42.375 --> 00:57:43.083
I can sense him.

585
00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:44.083
Father Marconi.

586
00:57:44.250 --> 00:57:46.166
I'm not Father Marconi.

587
00:57:48.458 --> 00:57:49.750
No, you're not.

588
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:53.041
You're one of them.

589
00:57:58.500 --> 00:57:59.958
Laura.

590
00:58:00.125 --> 00:58:02.250
Laura! Laura!

591
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.125
Get away from me!

592
00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:26.166
I'm not one of them.

593
00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:32.166
Who the hell are you then?

594
00:58:32.333 --> 00:58:34.208
Father Marconi is dead.

595
00:58:35.541 --> 00:58:39.916
I'm just borrowing him
for a bit.

596
00:58:40.083 --> 00:58:41.125
What?

597
00:58:47.583 --> 00:58:49.083
What did they do to you?

598
00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:52.500
I don't know how
you live in these things.

599
00:58:57.125 --> 00:58:58.208
What did they do?

600
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:04.250
They did experiments on us.

601
00:59:06.291 --> 00:59:07.875
What type of experiments?

602
00:59:09.625 --> 00:59:10.791
They raped me.

603
00:59:12.958 --> 00:59:16.625
They uh... they implanted me
with something.

604
00:59:16.791 --> 00:59:18.375
It was horrible.

605
00:59:18.541 --> 00:59:19.208
Are you pregnant?

606
00:59:19.375 --> 00:59:21.291
No! No!

607
00:59:21.458 --> 00:59:22.458
I don't know.

608
00:59:23.916 --> 00:59:25.083
It changes everything.

609
00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:26.750
Please, can we just
get out of here?

610
00:59:39.125 --> 00:59:41.250
Turn the damn alarm off.

611
00:59:42.958 --> 00:59:44.708
The Shroud is gone.

612
00:59:44.875 --> 00:59:46.208
Go and find it.

613
00:59:47.083 --> 00:59:48.333
Follow me.

614
00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:49.625
I know Michael is here.

615
00:59:50.291 --> 00:59:51.791
This way.

616
00:59:51.958 --> 00:59:52.958
Through here.

617
00:59:54.583 --> 00:59:55.708
No!

618
00:59:59.125 --> 01:00:00.791
Damn fool, you.

619
01:00:00.958 --> 01:00:03.125
Not a finger on her!

620
01:00:20.375 --> 01:00:21.375
What's wrong?

621
01:00:21.458 --> 01:00:22.458
My stomach.

622
01:00:24.125 --> 01:00:25.375
What is that?

623
01:00:27.458 --> 01:00:27.916
Shit.

624
01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:29.208
Let's go!

625
01:00:31.541 --> 01:00:32.708
Through here.

626
01:00:37.208 --> 01:00:38.916
Slip through here.
Come on!

627
01:00:39.083 --> 01:00:40.458
Come on.

628
01:00:47.291 --> 01:00:48.416
Get down!

629
01:00:50.583 --> 01:00:51.625
Come on!

630
01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:54.750
This way.

631
01:00:54.916 --> 01:00:56.000
It's just through here.

632
01:01:07.333 --> 01:01:10.125
Come on. It's okay.

633
01:01:12.708 --> 01:01:13.333
Ah!

634
01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:14.500
Are you okay?

635
01:01:14.625 --> 01:01:16.666
Yes, just stay there.

636
01:01:19.833 --> 01:01:21.583
What are you doing?

637
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:23.333
Hurry.

638
01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.500
It's coming back.

639
01:01:27.833 --> 01:01:28.625
Come on.

640
01:01:28.791 --> 01:01:29.875
Stay down, stay down.

641
01:01:30.041 --> 01:01:31.458
Where'd he go?

642
01:01:33.208 --> 01:01:34.208
Where'd he go?

643
01:01:34.583 --> 01:01:35.583
Watch out!

644
01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:54.208
Ah!

645
01:02:04.375 --> 01:02:05.500
No.

646
01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:07.875
No!

647
01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:18.291
Stupid little girl.

648
01:02:18.458 --> 01:02:20.875
Get her back safely.

649
01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:24.791
If you hurt him,
I'll kill the baby.

650
01:02:24.958 --> 01:02:26.333
You wouldn't dare.

651
01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:29.083
I'll have my chance.

652
01:02:30.416 --> 01:02:31.833
Ow!

653
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.125
Accept what is
happening to you, Laura.

654
01:02:34.291 --> 01:02:36.666
It would be much easier
this way.

655
01:02:36.833 --> 01:02:38.875
I killed your priest...

656
01:02:41.625 --> 01:02:44.083
and I'm going to
kill the angel within it.

657
01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:48.166
Go, find the Shroud.

658
01:02:48.333 --> 01:02:50.250
Without it, we only have her.

659
01:03:17.291 --> 01:03:19.625
Oh, you caused
quite a stir tonight.

660
01:03:21.625 --> 01:03:26.416
This can be your second chance
to live the life you lost.

661
01:03:26.583 --> 01:03:27.750
You sick bitch.

662
01:03:27.916 --> 01:03:29.708
You've no idea who I am!

663
01:03:29.875 --> 01:03:31.708
Calm down!

664
01:03:34.208 --> 01:03:37.958
This pregnancy
will be like no other.

665
01:03:38.125 --> 01:03:40.500
Prepare yourself.

666
01:03:41.375 --> 01:03:43.625
He can't wait to meet you.

667
01:04:13.458 --> 01:04:15.583
No visual of the Shroud. Over.

668
01:04:17.416 --> 01:04:18.416
DR. LAURENT

669
01:04:34.791 --> 01:04:36.625
I'm coming to find you, brother.

670
01:05:18.125 --> 01:05:20.041
The fetus is healthy.

671
01:06:10.125 --> 01:06:12.583
No, no.

672
01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:14.250
Why?

673
01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:22.833
Where is my sword?

674
01:06:25.083 --> 01:06:27.875
Now it's your turn
to rot in hell.

675
01:06:30.041 --> 01:06:31.083
Mammon?

676
01:06:32.083 --> 01:06:33.625
Michael.

677
01:06:33.791 --> 01:06:35.750
You look pale
without your sword.

678
01:06:35.916 --> 01:06:37.166
Where is he?

679
01:06:37.333 --> 01:06:39.250
Up with the mortals.

680
01:06:40.416 --> 01:06:42.666
We'll join him soon.

681
01:06:42.833 --> 01:06:46.250
Then we'll close the gateway
between the two worlds.

682
01:06:46.416 --> 01:06:49.958
And you,
you'll be imprisoned here.

683
01:06:50.125 --> 01:06:51.208
And we'll rule the Earth.

684
01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:53.291
I chained him!

685
01:06:53.458 --> 01:06:55.791
God would never set him free.

686
01:07:00.875 --> 01:07:02.333
Foolish.

687
01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:05.083
To take a mortal body down here.

688
01:07:07.833 --> 01:07:09.625
Now you're trapped in it.

689
01:07:09.791 --> 01:07:12.291
Chain him with Lucifer's sword.

690
01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:40.458
Look at him.

691
01:07:43.333 --> 01:07:46.083
He's given you
what you have lost.

692
01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:49.666
This child will never replace
what I lost.

693
01:07:49.833 --> 01:07:51.666
He'll give you even more.

694
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:57.333
Look.

695
01:08:00.083 --> 01:08:01.291
Mommy.

696
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:08.833
Did he speak to you?

697
01:08:12.791 --> 01:08:14.166
What?

698
01:08:15.041 --> 01:08:15.833
In your dream.

699
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.250
Did he say anything?

700
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Laura.

701
01:08:22.208 --> 01:08:24.958
I want to tell you a story.

702
01:08:27.416 --> 01:08:31.291
About a brave warrior
who stood up to

703
01:08:31.458 --> 01:08:33.250
a gloating tyrant.

704
01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:36.666
How long have I been asleep?

705
01:08:36.833 --> 01:08:39.375
The warrior and the tyrant
were equal.

706
01:08:40.625 --> 01:08:44.583
But the tyrant demanded
that the warrior bend his knee

707
01:08:44.750 --> 01:08:46.791
and be his slave.

708
01:08:50.833 --> 01:08:52.666
What's happening to me?

709
01:08:59.125 --> 01:09:02.916
Our warrior,
the brightest of all, refused.

710
01:09:05.625 --> 01:09:07.916
He fought to free us.

711
01:09:08.083 --> 01:09:11.833
He would be soon free
and fight for us again.

712
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.291
I don't give a shit about
your story about

713
01:09:14.458 --> 01:09:16.083
this goddamn demon seed, okay?

714
01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:17.250
I...

715
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.916
He suffered for you!

716
01:09:22.041 --> 01:09:25.291
And the least you can do is...

717
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.166
Laura.

718
01:09:34.708 --> 01:09:40.291
He's perfecting your body,
so you carry

719
01:09:40.458 --> 01:09:42.333
and protect the child.

720
01:09:43.583 --> 01:09:46.208
I want him out of me.

721
01:09:49.125 --> 01:09:51.291
I know, Laura. I know.

722
01:09:51.458 --> 01:09:53.083
This is difficult.

723
01:09:53.250 --> 01:09:57.000
Yeah, you kidnapped me,
put this thing inside me

724
01:09:57.166 --> 01:09:59.000
and now hold me prisoner.

725
01:09:59.166 --> 01:10:01.916
Yeah, it's a bit difficult.

726
01:10:02.083 --> 01:10:06.666
Once the child is born,
you'll be free.

727
01:10:07.291 --> 01:10:08.833
I promise.

728
01:10:10.708 --> 01:10:13.916
But for now, I control you.

729
01:10:14.083 --> 01:10:16.666
And I demand respect.

730
01:10:42.666 --> 01:10:43.666
Doll!

731
01:10:48.041 --> 01:10:49.166
Say quick, angel or demon?

732
01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:50.875
Stay away from him, Doll.

733
01:11:00.416 --> 01:11:01.458
Who are you?

734
01:11:01.625 --> 01:11:03.333
How did you get here?

735
01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:05.083
We're the Stolen.

736
01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:06.875
They stole us for Lucifer.

737
01:11:08.333 --> 01:11:09.583
We just want to go home.

738
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:12.166
We don't belong here.

739
01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:14.500
Do you want to join us?

740
01:11:14.583 --> 01:11:15.708
Take the pledge.

741
01:11:15.875 --> 01:11:16.958
If one gets free...

742
01:11:17.125 --> 01:11:18.291
- All go home.
- All go home.

743
01:11:18.458 --> 01:11:19.791
You're a fool to trust
any angel.

744
01:11:19.958 --> 01:11:21.125
Say it.

745
01:11:23.041 --> 01:11:26.791
If one gets free, all go home.

746
01:11:26.958 --> 01:11:28.416
What's your name, angel?

747
01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:30.875
Michael.

748
01:11:31.041 --> 01:11:32.083
The archangel.

749
01:11:32.958 --> 01:11:35.333
Show us. Soar to the heavens.

750
01:11:39.625 --> 01:11:41.416
Bring me my sword and I will.

751
01:11:42.625 --> 01:11:43.958
Sword?

752
01:11:44.125 --> 01:11:50.000
It's about this big,
silver, gold, sharp.

753
01:11:50.166 --> 01:11:52.125
Yeah, we know
what a sword looks like.

754
01:11:52.291 --> 01:11:53.708
If there was a sword, we'd know.

755
01:11:53.875 --> 01:11:55.351
We're scroungers,
that's how we survive.

756
01:11:55.375 --> 01:11:57.583
There is no sword to save you.

757
01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:59.500
Just use your power.

758
01:11:59.666 --> 01:12:00.946
You're the archangel,
aren't you?

759
01:12:01.958 --> 01:12:02.958
They're here!

760
01:12:08.041 --> 01:12:09.625
Run!

761
01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:18.458
Doll, they got Zar!

762
01:12:18.625 --> 01:12:19.458
Get off me!

763
01:12:19.625 --> 01:12:22.083
Leave them be!

764
01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:24.041
No!

765
01:13:31.041 --> 01:13:34.708
I will give your painful life meaning.

766
01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:43.250
Did you kill my husband?

767
01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:47.791
My child?

768
01:13:47.958 --> 01:13:49.041
No.

769
01:13:49.208 --> 01:13:51.708
I've given you a child to love.

770
01:13:51.875 --> 01:13:54.666
I hate what that murderer
did to you.

771
01:13:54.833 --> 01:13:57.250
He took everything from you.

772
01:13:57.416 --> 01:14:01.583
I fear some of the nurses here
might do the same.

773
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:04.375
You should do something
about it.

774
01:14:05.958 --> 01:14:09.666
I hate her.

775
01:14:09.833 --> 01:14:11.791
Liz envies you.

776
01:14:11.958 --> 01:14:13.208
If you like,

777
01:14:14.166 --> 01:14:16.291
I'll let you kill her.

778
01:14:16.458 --> 01:14:18.875
If that pleases you, Laura.

779
01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:22.708
Very much.

780
01:14:56.208 --> 01:14:59.416
I cannot come to Earth
without you.

781
01:14:59.583 --> 01:15:01.708
Give yourself to me.

782
01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:06.375
As I have given myself to you.

783
01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:35.625
The child is a drain
on her health.

784
01:15:35.791 --> 01:15:37.083
We have to do something.

785
01:15:37.791 --> 01:15:40.000
Laura is not getting weaker.

786
01:15:40.166 --> 01:15:43.083
She is bonding with the child.

787
01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:45.666
I can feel
she's getting stronger.

788
01:16:23.083 --> 01:16:24.083
Hello.

789
01:16:59.791 --> 01:17:02.250
What are you doing to me?

790
01:17:04.125 --> 01:17:05.958
Oh my God.

791
01:17:10.333 --> 01:17:11.458
I have to kill you.

792
01:17:11.625 --> 01:17:12.958
Mother, no.

793
01:17:38.833 --> 01:17:41.833
Laura, stop this now.

794
01:17:48.041 --> 01:17:49.833
No!

795
01:17:59.291 --> 01:18:01.166
No!

796
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.083
No!

797
01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:11.208
No!

798
01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:34.208
Where is she?

799
01:18:40.916 --> 01:18:42.416
Open the door!

800
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.916
Laura!

801
01:18:56.625 --> 01:18:57.625
All gone.

802
01:18:57.666 --> 01:19:00.083
How dare you, bitch!

803
01:19:06.083 --> 01:19:08.625
Go, go, get Laurent.

804
01:19:13.041 --> 01:19:17.666
You have no idea
what suffering means,

805
01:19:18.250 --> 01:19:21.375
until you live
our eternal misery,

806
01:19:21.541 --> 01:19:24.041
living in the dark
and in the dirt.

807
01:19:24.208 --> 01:19:27.916
And you,
you want to kill our Christ!

808
01:19:28.083 --> 01:19:29.958
You are the monster.

809
01:19:32.625 --> 01:19:34.291
You will be gone soon.

810
01:19:35.666 --> 01:19:38.333
Lucifer will consume you.

811
01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:40.666
But don't fear.

812
01:19:40.833 --> 01:19:44.750
Full possession is a comfort.

813
01:19:44.916 --> 01:19:46.291
Like death.

814
01:19:48.666 --> 01:19:52.875
All your silly independence
will end.

815
01:20:29.208 --> 01:20:31.916
How do you like it?

816
01:20:41.875 --> 01:20:47.208
No more mistakes.

817
01:20:47.416 --> 01:20:49.875
Lucifer, forgive me.

818
01:21:04.583 --> 01:21:08.583
I'm weary of Laura's womb.

819
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:13.666
Being stuck up inside
her stinking mess.

820
01:21:13.833 --> 01:21:17.458
I wish it could be
you inside of me.

821
01:21:18.958 --> 01:21:22.458
Ah, baby.

822
01:21:23.833 --> 01:21:27.458
You have always been beside me.

823
01:21:28.916 --> 01:21:32.333
We've always been
one and the same.

824
01:21:36.750 --> 01:21:38.916
The same?

825
01:21:39.083 --> 01:21:42.333
Ah!

826
01:21:48.875 --> 01:21:51.125
After the birth, no one can live

827
01:21:51.291 --> 01:21:53.041
who knows what happened here.

828
01:21:53.208 --> 01:21:54.708
Of course.

829
01:21:54.875 --> 01:21:57.583
And we will close the hell hole
with explosives

830
01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:59.625
after your army ascends.

831
01:21:59.791 --> 01:22:01.500
Good.

832
01:22:01.666 --> 01:22:04.833
Hell shall come to Earth.

833
01:22:05.833 --> 01:22:07.000
Yes.

834
01:22:07.166 --> 01:22:09.208
There is something else.

835
01:22:09.375 --> 01:22:12.166
I thought Laura
would come to love me.

836
01:22:12.333 --> 01:22:15.291
How I loathe that fucking whore.

837
01:22:16.958 --> 01:22:19.291
Even worse,

838
01:22:20.583 --> 01:22:22.958
the child has come to love her.

839
01:22:24.416 --> 01:22:28.583
He is willful
and wants his mommy.

840
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:31.541
I didn't expect this.

841
01:22:32.708 --> 01:22:34.000
Oh well,

842
01:22:35.291 --> 01:22:39.208
once I'm born, kill her.

843
01:22:40.833 --> 01:22:42.916
That will be my pleasure.

844
01:22:45.708 --> 01:22:51.166
And you, do something to
stop this bitch from killing me.

845
01:23:06.875 --> 01:23:08.791
This could be me.

846
01:23:13.583 --> 01:23:14.750
Should have been me.

847
01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:27.208
Saint Michael,
protect us against

848
01:23:27.375 --> 01:23:29.583
the snares and wickedness
of the devil.

849
01:23:38.958 --> 01:23:42.166
I pray God sends you help
and reveals to you

850
01:23:42.333 --> 01:23:44.208
how to defeat this evil.

851
01:26:18.166 --> 01:26:21.208
Oh, you are miserable, brother.

852
01:26:30.333 --> 01:26:32.166
Why did God set you free?

853
01:26:33.625 --> 01:26:34.958
He fears me.

854
01:26:35.125 --> 01:26:36.583
He does not fear you.

855
01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:38.583
Which is why
you must lead my army

856
01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:39.916
against Him.

857
01:26:40.083 --> 01:26:42.958
Then, we will be free.

858
01:26:44.916 --> 01:26:45.916
No.

859
01:26:47.291 --> 01:26:50.416
The last thing you want
is for others to be free.

860
01:26:51.458 --> 01:26:52.166
You're a tyrant.

861
01:26:52.333 --> 01:26:53.875
You fool!

862
01:26:54.041 --> 01:26:58.000
My angels are coming to end you.

863
01:26:58.166 --> 01:27:01.041
You are powerless
without your sword

864
01:27:01.208 --> 01:27:02.708
of the spirit.

865
01:27:05.083 --> 01:27:06.958
Thank you, Michael.

866
01:27:08.375 --> 01:27:09.625
For what?

867
01:27:09.791 --> 01:27:12.041
For failing.

868
01:27:12.208 --> 01:27:14.416
For this revenge.

869
01:27:14.583 --> 01:27:16.125
But most of all...

870
01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:20.875
for my new home.

871
01:27:22.083 --> 01:27:24.833
I will now control
the Earthly body of

872
01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.166
God's precious son.

873
01:27:27.333 --> 01:27:30.500
The ultimate "fuck you, Daddy".

874
01:27:50.208 --> 01:27:51.666
Of course.

875
01:27:53.833 --> 01:27:57.333
I've been blind, foolish.

876
01:27:58.416 --> 01:27:59.416
Forget him, Doll!

877
01:27:59.458 --> 01:28:01.041
He's our last hope.

878
01:28:01.208 --> 01:28:03.958
I forgot that there are those
more powerful than me.

879
01:28:05.583 --> 01:28:09.041
And every scheme of the devil
will be turned against him.

880
01:28:09.208 --> 01:28:10.608
He's just bait
for us to get caught.

881
01:28:10.750 --> 01:28:11.583
Come help us, Grunt!

882
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:13.291
I need to get to Laura.

883
01:28:13.458 --> 01:28:14.958
Come on, quickly.

884
01:28:15.125 --> 01:28:16.165
They'll be coming for you.

885
01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:17.833
Bring me my sword.

886
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:18.625
Quickly!

887
01:28:18.791 --> 01:28:19.791
Listen to me!

888
01:28:19.916 --> 01:28:21.333
I need my sword.

889
01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:23.791
And Grunt, I can set you free.

890
01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:29.208
No, come on Doll. Come on!

891
01:28:29.375 --> 01:28:30.541
Don't...

892
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:32.750
Listen to me.

893
01:28:32.916 --> 01:28:34.041
Bring me my sword!

894
01:28:34.208 --> 01:28:34.916
Is there any other way?

895
01:28:35.083 --> 01:28:35.875
No!

896
01:28:36.041 --> 01:28:36.708
Come on!

897
01:28:36.875 --> 01:28:38.250
Grunt, come on.

898
01:28:38.416 --> 01:28:39.500
Come on.

899
01:28:41.166 --> 01:28:42.226
They're coming, they're coming!

900
01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:43.791
Michael, get out!

901
01:28:46.666 --> 01:28:47.125
Help!

902
01:28:47.291 --> 01:28:48.291
Help him!

903
01:28:48.375 --> 01:28:49.583
Help me, Doll!

904
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:51.166
Hurry!

905
01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:53.541
Help me!

906
01:29:00.125 --> 01:29:01.833
I need my sword.

907
01:29:02.875 --> 01:29:04.708
Stop!

908
01:29:04.875 --> 01:29:07.458
Give me the sword
and I'll spare you.

909
01:29:07.625 --> 01:29:09.125
Can you get us home?

910
01:29:09.291 --> 01:29:10.625
Of course, I can.

911
01:29:10.791 --> 01:29:12.041
- What are you doing?
- Grunt.

912
01:29:12.208 --> 01:29:13.750
Bring it to me.
And I will free you.

913
01:29:13.916 --> 01:29:15.541
Don't listen to him.
He's a liar.

914
01:29:15.708 --> 01:29:16.458
Grunt, you have to trust me!

915
01:29:16.625 --> 01:29:17.750
No, no!

916
01:29:17.916 --> 01:29:18.666
Bring it to me!

917
01:29:18.833 --> 01:29:19.625
We don't know him, Doll.

918
01:29:19.791 --> 01:29:20.791
But this is different.

919
01:29:20.958 --> 01:29:22.333
We've been burned before.

920
01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:23.500
Please.

921
01:29:36.083 --> 01:29:38.166
I promise I'll return.

922
01:29:38.333 --> 01:29:39.333
If one gets free...

923
01:29:39.416 --> 01:29:41.083
All go home.

924
01:30:40.875 --> 01:30:43.166
Oh, what have they done to you?

925
01:30:45.041 --> 01:30:46.541
Laura.

926
01:30:46.708 --> 01:30:49.250
You've got to trust me,
this child is not evil.

927
01:30:55.416 --> 01:30:57.000
Laura.

928
01:30:57.166 --> 01:31:00.291
Laura isn't here right now.

929
01:31:01.250 --> 01:31:02.833
No!

930
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.291
Laura, I know
you're still in there.

931
01:31:05.458 --> 01:31:06.875
I'm gonna get you out of here.

932
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Stop!

933
01:31:19.250 --> 01:31:20.250
Stop!

934
01:31:25.291 --> 01:31:26.291
Stay with me.

935
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:40.166
Laura, listen to me.

936
01:31:40.333 --> 01:31:42.250
This child is
not what you think.

937
01:31:42.416 --> 01:31:43.416
He will defeat the devil.

938
01:32:03.625 --> 01:32:06.625
Brother...

939
01:32:06.791 --> 01:32:10.041
I have wonderful news.

940
01:32:13.166 --> 01:32:14.708
My water's broken.

941
01:32:39.708 --> 01:32:42.375
Worship me or I'll end you.

942
01:32:42.541 --> 01:32:43.541
Never!

943
01:32:52.166 --> 01:32:57.083
Loving me will be a moment
of clarity for you.

944
01:33:02.458 --> 01:33:08.041
Even those against me
will question their judgment.

945
01:33:09.375 --> 01:33:11.458
We can rule Earth and heaven.

946
01:33:12.250 --> 01:33:14.958
We just have to kill Dad.

947
01:33:16.166 --> 01:33:20.625
He just gave me a message
for you.

948
01:33:21.333 --> 01:33:23.166
Whisper it in my ear.

949
01:33:23.333 --> 01:33:25.333
You won't possess the baby.

950
01:33:26.083 --> 01:33:27.708
He will possess you.

951
01:33:32.041 --> 01:33:33.708
He will possess me?

952
01:33:43.666 --> 01:33:45.416
No!

953
01:33:45.583 --> 01:33:49.083
The child will not be
my undoing.

954
01:33:49.250 --> 01:33:51.333
Can't you sense it even now?

955
01:33:51.958 --> 01:33:54.458
This child is born
of eternal blood.

956
01:33:54.625 --> 01:33:56.208
Shut up!

957
01:33:56.375 --> 01:33:58.541
He is more powerful than you.

958
01:33:58.708 --> 01:34:01.333
Because good is more powerful
than evil!

959
01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:03.000
Motherfucker!

960
01:34:05.625 --> 01:34:07.666
Try to stop your contraction.

961
01:34:07.833 --> 01:34:09.958
You can't stop this baby
from being born.

962
01:34:10.125 --> 01:34:11.250
He wants to be born.

963
01:34:12.458 --> 01:34:14.291
To bind you like I bound you.

964
01:34:16.958 --> 01:34:19.375
You are not God's equal!

965
01:34:20.083 --> 01:34:22.916
You rule over the rebellion.
That is all.

966
01:34:23.083 --> 01:34:25.125
And in every age,
you are defeated.

967
01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:34.541
Laura! Open the door!

968
01:34:36.583 --> 01:34:37.583
No!

969
01:34:39.416 --> 01:34:40.416
Kill it!

970
01:34:40.541 --> 01:34:41.583
I will not!

971
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:42.541
Listen to me!

972
01:34:42.708 --> 01:34:44.666
No more tricks, Laura.

973
01:34:44.833 --> 01:34:45.833
Get her to the altar.

974
01:34:45.958 --> 01:34:46.708
No.

975
01:34:46.875 --> 01:34:48.250
It's God who tricked us.

976
01:34:48.416 --> 01:34:50.083
No, no!

977
01:35:09.333 --> 01:35:12.916
Push. Keep pushing.

978
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Good.

979
01:35:27.125 --> 01:35:28.125
Yes, it's...

980
01:35:30.166 --> 01:35:32.875
Where are you taking my baby?

981
01:35:51.125 --> 01:35:52.583
No, no.

982
01:35:53.375 --> 01:35:54.833
No!

983
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.916
No, no!

984
01:35:57.083 --> 01:35:58.083
No!

985
01:36:25.250 --> 01:36:30.166
Welcome our beautiful,
exalted prince.

986
01:36:31.041 --> 01:36:35.416
We're no longer
under the tyranny of God.

987
01:36:42.166 --> 01:36:44.125
Our lost eternal.

988
01:36:47.541 --> 01:36:48.541
Worship him.

989
01:37:01.708 --> 01:37:04.083
Lord Lucifer...

990
01:37:06.291 --> 01:37:12.041
I baptize you
not with water...

991
01:37:12.208 --> 01:37:13.875
but with blood.

992
01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:12.750
Take them all!

993
01:39:24.166 --> 01:39:27.208
He found you in your youth.

994
01:39:28.333 --> 01:39:30.458
I want to be a part of it.

995
01:39:30.625 --> 01:39:32.208
I know you do.

996
01:39:33.541 --> 01:39:36.333
But I have something
much more precious.

997
01:39:38.791 --> 01:39:40.583
You'll have a moment with him.

998
01:39:57.250 --> 01:39:58.708
Check inside.

999
01:39:58.875 --> 01:40:01.291
No one can live
to tell the story.

1000
01:40:24.208 --> 01:40:26.166
Laura. Laura!

1001
01:40:27.291 --> 01:40:28.291
Laura.

1002
01:40:30.458 --> 01:40:31.458
- Laura!
- Michael!

1003
01:40:31.583 --> 01:40:32.583
Come, come on!

1004
01:40:34.416 --> 01:40:35.708
Come on, that's it.

1005
01:40:35.875 --> 01:40:36.625
That's it.

1006
01:40:36.791 --> 01:40:38.375
Come on, that's it.

1007
01:40:38.541 --> 01:40:40.125
Where's my baby?

1008
01:40:48.041 --> 01:40:49.083
Give me my baby.

1009
01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:51.750
No!

1010
01:40:52.583 --> 01:40:53.833
No, no!

1011
01:40:55.333 --> 01:40:57.500
Michael, don't harm my Lucifer.

1012
01:40:57.666 --> 01:40:59.750
The child is not Lucifer.

1013
01:40:59.916 --> 01:41:02.041
He has his own destiny.

1014
01:41:02.208 --> 01:41:04.125
Lucifer's lust for revenge
blinds him.

1015
01:41:05.458 --> 01:41:08.125
He chose the only DNA
that can imprison him.

1016
01:41:08.291 --> 01:41:10.583
Lucifer didn't choose Laura.

1017
01:41:10.750 --> 01:41:12.000
God did.

1018
01:41:12.166 --> 01:41:13.666
Come on!

1019
01:41:13.833 --> 01:41:15.291
Find Cardinal Vincini.

1020
01:41:15.458 --> 01:41:16.791
Where are you going?

1021
01:41:16.958 --> 01:41:18.083
Home.

1022
01:41:18.250 --> 01:41:19.666
But first I have
a promise to keep.

1023
01:41:23.041 --> 01:41:24.250
You're too late!

1024
01:41:24.625 --> 01:41:26.500
Hell is coming to Earth.

1025
01:41:27.458 --> 01:41:28.458
Go now!

1026
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.333
Thank you, Marconi.

1027
01:42:38.625 --> 01:42:40.416
But I miss my old self.

1028
01:43:04.875 --> 01:43:06.458
The hound of heaven indeed.

1029
01:43:24.666 --> 01:43:27.083
Maybe some of you may say,
that Father,

1030
01:43:27.250 --> 01:43:30.125
how old fashioned you are
to speak about the devil

1031
01:43:30.291 --> 01:43:32.458
in the 21st century.

1032
01:43:32.625 --> 01:43:35.958
But look out.
The devil's present.

1033
01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:38.500
The devil's here.

1034
01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.416
Even in the 21st century.

1035
01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:47.708
