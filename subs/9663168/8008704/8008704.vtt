Exactly.

145
00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:42.583
Evil is not some external,
mystical force.

146
00:07:44.625 --> 00:07:45.625
It's personal.

147
00:07:46.583 --> 00:07:48.291
I disagree.

148
00:07:48.458 --> 00:07:49.833
It's much more than that.

149

the devil himself

sat for his portrait.

00:07:55.833 --> 00:07:57.250
I think he may be right.

152
00:07:59.916 --> 00:08:02.625
I know of many good people
who have endured

153
00:08:02.791 --> 00:08:03.791
horrendous evil.

154
00:08:04.916 --> 00:08:05.958
Other-worldly evil.

00:08:06.125 --> 00:08:08.583
Yeah, so do I.

156
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.958
But when something happens
to someone we deeply love,

157
00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:15.500
blaming it on the devil
doesn't fix anything.

158

reduce the pain.

Why are you here?

565
00:33:48.166 --> 00:33:50.083
They stole the Shroud.

MICHAEL: I have the surveillance
footage from the Cathedral.

567
00:33:55.708 --> 00:33:57.375
Was it a woman?

568
00:33:57.541 --> 00:33:58.583
An old woman?

569
00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:00.416
Yes, it was.

570
00:34:02.625 --> 00:34:03.750
Where is she?

571
00:34:06.083 --> 00:34:08.458
This asylum was built
as a lookout.

572
00:34:10.083 --> 00:34:13.250
Over here. Look.
Come here.

573
00:34:14.583 --> 00:34:15.583

576
00:34:26.458 --> 00:34:31.375
Those who guard it
work for Lucifer's release.

577
00:34:31.541 --> 00:34:34.750
Don't call that devil
by his angelic name.

578
00:34:36.458 --> 00:34:37.625
He can't escape.

579
00:34:38.625 --> 00:34:39.958
I chained him there.

580
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:44.916
Come with me.

581
00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:47.291
Scripture tells us the devil
will be shaken loose

582
00:34:47.458 --> 00:34:48.541
from his chains.

583
00:34:48.708 --> 00:34:50.083
The gate to hell will be opened.

584
00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:52.375
And he and his demons
will come to Earth.

585
00:34:54.916 --> 00:34:57.208
Now is that time.

586
00:35:03.916 --> 00:35:08.125
Two ancient beasts
who are of both worlds

587
00:35:08.291 --> 00:35:10.166
have been charged
with his release.

588
00:35:11.625 --> 00:35:14.875
The woman, whom you've met.

589
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.375
And the beast of the ground.

590
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:24.017
The only beast that
Satan allowed to come to Earth

591
00:35:24.041 --> 00:35:25.041
before him.

592
00:35:26.916 --> 00:35:28.956
There is nothing he wants more
than to fight his way

593
00:35:29.041 --> 00:35:29.625
out of hell.

594
00:35:29.791 --> 00:35:30.958
I know that.

595
00:35:31.125 --> 00:35:32.833
I put him there.

596
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.208
And only I can free him.

597
00:35:35.375 --> 00:35:37.083
You mean God?

598
00:35:43.083 --> 00:35:47.833
These scrolls are from
the occult that guards the gate.

599
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:52.000
They believe their Lord,
like Jesus,

600
00:35:52.166 --> 00:35:54.750
would be born from innocence.

601
00:35:54.916 --> 00:35:58.541
For centuries, they offered him
children for him to possess.

602
00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:02.541
No! No!

603
00:36:02.708 --> 00:36:04.267
Their young bodies
were not strong enough

604
00:36:04.291 --> 00:36:05.375
to contain him.

605
00:36:05.541 --> 00:36:06.833
Their suffering was unspeakable.

606
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.458
And we did nothing.

607
00:36:08.625 --> 00:36:11.625
The devil can't control
his pride or his rage.

608
00:36:11.791 --> 00:36:14.583
Therefore, he cannot possess
a mortal body.

609
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:15.458
He'd destroy it.

610
00:36:15.625 --> 00:36:16.666
Not any.

611
00:36:17.916 --> 00:36:22.875
There is one body
that has held an eternal.

612
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:25.416
And now science
has given the devil

613
00:36:25.583 --> 00:36:27.208
his way out of hell.

614
00:36:27.375 --> 00:36:29.455

to inhabit such a body.

618
