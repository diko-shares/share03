Daddy.
It's early.

4
00:03:00.223 --> 00:03:04.351
Yeah, I know. I just wanted to let
you know I'm sending you something.

- No. But it's sparkly.

we'll have some breakfast, huh?

- Well, I like the guy, Stella,

11

think I've paid my P.O. his last visit.

Don't break my heart.

- I'm on a cell phone, darling.

Fine.

Ohh! You're the man.
What's on the lineup?

173
00:26:26.099 --> 00:26:30.228
Todd Milliken called. He has a prototype
combination lock he wants you to test out.

174
00:26:30.269 --> 00:26:34.316
He says he added two false
contact points on the tumbler.

I'll pretend to be stumped for a
couple of seconds, give him a thrill.

<i>Charlie Croker.</i>
Hey, Stella.

178
00:26:52.292 --> 00:26:56.254
Didn't I tell you
I never wanna see you again?

father died right in front of your eyes...</i>

181
00:27:05.804 --> 00:27:08.975

182
00:27:09.017 --> 00:27:11.602
<i>He's in Los Angeles.</i>

183
00:27:11.644 --> 00:27:15.147

a Balinese dancer stamped on them.

<i>I just got word from a contact called Skinny Pete
that a dealer out in L.A.'s been buyin' those.</i>

185
00:27:19.485 --> 00:27:22.655
Yeah?
How do you know it's him?

186
00:27:22.697 --> 00:27:26.283
Skinny Pete sent me this.

187
00:27:26.325 --> 00:27:29.995
Steve changed his last name
to Frezelli.

188
00:27:34.374 --> 00:27:38.795
- Why are you telling me this?
- I've been checking databases of high-end safe companies.

189
00:27:38.837 --> 00:27:41.715
Found out Steve had a Worthington
1000 delivered to his home office.

190
00:27:41.756 --> 00:27:44.926
<i>You don't install a Worthington unless
you've got something really big to guard.</i>

191
00:27:44.968 --> 00:27:48.179
- No, you don't.
- Problem is no one on my crew can handle Steve's safe.

192
00:27:48.221 --> 00:27:53.518
- I need somebody I can trust.
- I'm a professional safe and vault technician, not a thief.

193
00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:58.481
Hey, it's not about the gold, Stella, okay?
John was like a father to me too.

194
00:28:01.108 --> 00:28:06.239
Look. I'm sorry, all right? I just can't
move on until I've set things right.

195
00:28:12.161 --> 00:28:15.790
I've moved on.

196
00:29:18.225 --> 00:29:22.648
Come on, Charlie. Come on.

197
00:29:26.819 --> 00:29:28.569
Hello?

198
00:29:28.611 --> 00:29:32.072
I wanna see the look on that man's
face when his gold is gone.

199
00:29:32.114 --> 00:29:36.494
He took my father from me.
I'm taking this.

200
00:29:39.664 --> 00:29:42.333
- She's in.
- That's a good thing.

201
00:29:42.374 --> 00:29:45.210
It's a very good thing. She can crack the
Worthington 1000 without even flinching.

202
00:29:45.252 --> 00:29:47.921
I'm not sure having a civilian on
the crew's a good idea, Charlie.

203
00:29:47.963 --> 00:29:52.092
She's got the skills. She's
got the motivation. Exactly.

204
00:29:52.134 --> 00:29:55.596
She's emotional. You know what
happens when emotion gets into it.

205
00:29:55.638 --> 00:29:58.473
Look. Don't kid yourself, all right?
We're all emotional on this one.

We're a little early. I didn't expect
us to get here quite that fast.

211
00:30:40.097 --> 00:30:44.936
There. That's Lyle.
He's my computer genius.

But, if we had green lights all the
way, we could do it in 14 minutes.

317
00:38:42.236 --> 00:38:46.199
Wait. You couldn't
get through traffic?

318
00:38:48.117 --> 00:38:50.119
Oh.

319
00:38:50.161 --> 00:38:53.622
We could do anything with
green lights all the way.

320
00:38:53.664 --> 00:38:57.668
- Lyle?
- Lyle?

321
00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:02.798
I'll see what I can do.

322
00:39:05.467 --> 00:39:09.847
You're right on time.

323
00:39:11.764 --> 00:39:15.810
All these poor bastards out there,
putting their life's savings in banks...

324
00:39:15.852 --> 00:39:18.188
and S&Ls and mutual funds.

325
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:22.150
How do they think? When the collapse
comes, they can depend on the government?

326
00:39:22.192 --> 00:39:25.153
I don't think so.
Are you taping me?

327
00:39:25.195 --> 00:39:29.449
Of course not. I never tape you.
Come look. See for yourself.

328
00:39:31.534 --> 00:39:34.829
Governments are nothing more
than puppets and strings.

329
00:39:34.871 --> 00:39:39.251
In the world where NAFTA can
overrule the Supreme Court...

330
00:39:39.292 --> 00:39:43.713
Like my cousin Mashkov always says,
"This is our only refuge, baby.

331
00:39:43.755 --> 00:39:47.133
<i>Gold."</i>

332
00:39:54.099 --> 00:39:58.853
Every time I look at these
engravings... She's so beautiful.

333
00:39:58.895 --> 00:40:02.440
- Where'd you say you got these?
- I didn't.

334
00:40:06.944 --> 00:40:12.199
A little "walking around" money.

335
00:40:20.207 --> 00:40:23.252
I guess I'm not walkin' as
far as I thought. I'm sorry.

336
00:40:23.294 --> 00:40:26.588
- I can only buy two bricks from you today.
- That wasn't the agreement.

337
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:30.550
What can I say? I'm just middleman.
I'll buy the other two on Wednesday.

338
00:40:30.592 --> 00:40:33.303
Don't waste my time, Yevhen.

339
00:40:42.813 --> 00:40:49.069
<i>So what does a man with $35
million worth of gold do at night?</i>

340
00:40:49.944 --> 00:40:53.949
<i>He watches his big-ass TV.</i>

341
00:40:55.199 --> 00:40:57.285
That's our in.

342
00:41:20.766 --> 00:41:24.521
Stella.
Jesus! Charlie!

343
00:41:24.561 --> 00:41:28.191
How did you get in here? Well, I
knocked, but you didn't answer.

344
00:41:28.232 --> 00:41:32.695
- So you just let yourself in?
- I was just making sure you were okay. I apologize.

345
00:41:32.736 --> 00:41:35.989
I just... I...
<i>Don't look.</i>

346
00:41:40.203 --> 00:41:42.579
Okay.

347
00:41:44.499 --> 00:41:48.710
You have a lot of stuff here. You
know, your dad was old school.

348
00:41:48.751 --> 00:41:51.421
- He did the whole thing by touch.
- That worked for him.

349
00:41:51.463 --> 00:41:55.509
This works for me. Technology guarantees
speed and accuracy, you know?

350
00:41:55.551 --> 00:41:59.971
Yeah, but there's no guarantees
in this business, Stella.

351
00:42:00.013 --> 00:42:04.100
Why the headphones?
Just training myself.

352
00:42:04.142 --> 00:42:08.188
Ambient noises,
you know. Just in case.

353
00:42:09.898 --> 00:42:12.817
What do you want, Charlie?

354
00:42:12.859 --> 00:42:15.529
We're gonna knock out Steve's cable,
and we need to send in a repairman.

355
00:42:15.571 --> 00:42:20.033
To get your video blueprint
of the interior. Yep.

356
00:42:20.075 --> 00:42:24.120
Only problem is,
Steve thinks we're all dead.

357
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:27.331
Except me.

358
00:42:29.501 --> 00:42:34.464
I'll do it, Charlie. I'm in... all the way.
Whatever it takes.

359
00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.511
All right. I'll set it up. Okay.

360
00:42:39.553 --> 00:42:44.181
Um, you, um, maybe wanna get a drink
downstairs with me before I go back to my room?

361
00:42:46.725 --> 00:42:51.980
I should finish this stuff up, you know?
Just get it all done tonight.

362
00:42:52.022 --> 00:42:54.900
Yeah. Sorry
I scared you.

363
00:42:54.942 --> 00:42:56.944
It's okay.

364
00:42:56.985 --> 00:43:01.156
- Good night.
- Bye.

365
00:43:01.198 --> 00:43:05.702
And then he's the media darling,
on the cover of all the magazines.

366
00:43:05.744 --> 00:43:08.956
I should've been on the cover of<i> Wired</i>
magazine. You know what he said?

367
00:43:08.997 --> 00:43:13.876
He said he named it Napster because it was
his nickname 'cause of the nappy hair.

368
00:43:13.918 --> 00:43:18.132
But he... It's 'cause I was napping
when he stole it from me.

369
00:43:18.173 --> 00:43:21.050
He didn't even graduate.

370
00:43:21.092 --> 00:43:27.515
I think it's time to move on, don't you? They
shut him down. I wish they'd do the same to you.

371
00:43:28.933 --> 00:43:32.062
Here. Here we go.
Cable chick.

372
00:43:41.613 --> 00:43:44.449
<i>Huh. "Becky."</i>

373
00:43:44.491 --> 00:43:46.826
Nice name. I wonder what
she calls the other one.

374
00:43:46.867 --> 00:43:49.745
And it's such a mystery why you
don't have a girlfriend, Lyle.

375
00:43:49.787 --> 00:43:56.043
<i>So all we need is a service truck
like that one, a work shirt like hers.</i>

376
00:43:56.084 --> 00:44:00.046
You think Stella can pull it off?
I have my doubts.

377
00:44:00.088 --> 00:44:03.217
Mmm. But there's no talkin'
to Charlie, though.

378
00:44:03.259 --> 00:44:08.556
You think he's
mixing business with pleasure?

379
00:44:08.598 --> 00:44:13.101
Yeah. He should know better.
Only I'm allowed to do that.

380
00:44:14.978 --> 00:44:20.609
Right. Where you goin'? To get a
work shirt and a service truck.

381
00:44:28.867 --> 00:44:32.496
Are you kiddin' me?

382
00:44:34.289 --> 00:44:38.544
How does he do that? How do you do that?
What are you sayin'?

383
00:44:38.585 --> 00:44:41.630
<i>- Hey, how are you?
- Oh, I'm good.</i>

384
00:44:41.672 --> 00:44:45.759
I'm good. Nice to meet you.
I'm Handsome Rob. And you are?

385
00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:48.761
<i>Oh, my name's Becky,
but it's written on my shirt.</i>

386
00:44:48.802 --> 00:44:52.140
Listen. I'm gonna need
your shirt and your truck.

387
00:44:52.182 --> 00:44:56.186
Perfect. I'll give 'em both to
you. Would you like my virginity as well?

388
00:44:56.227 --> 00:44:58.522
If it's on the menu.

389
00:44:58.564 --> 00:45:00.648
You're so witty. Why
don't you take advantage of me?

390
00:45:00.691 --> 00:45:05.403
Yeah. You're not too bright,
are you? No. Perfect.

391
00:46:50.547 --> 00:46:54.092
What can I do for you, Mr. Frezelli?
The cable's out.

392
00:46:54.134 --> 00:46:59.807
The TV, the modem, everything. Now, get
somebody up here, and tell 'em to hurry up.

393
00:47:01.308 --> 00:47:05.354
<i>NetCom Cable. How can I help you?</i>

394
00:47:05.395 --> 00:47:09.106
<i>Hi. I'm up here at 3320
East Skyway, and the cable's just gone out.</i>

395
00:47:09.148 --> 00:47:11.609
- Our modem. Everything.
- Let's see, sir.

396
00:47:11.651 --> 00:47:14.780
- I have Thursday between 9:00 and 3:00.
<i>- That's gonna work.</i>

397
00:47:14.822 --> 00:47:18.742
<i>Thank you. Guard just
called the cable company.</i>

398
00:47:21.161 --> 00:47:25.289
What time's the appointment?
Thursday between 9:00 and 3:00.

399
00:47:32.087 --> 00:47:34.465
Hello?

400
00:47:34.507 --> 00:47:39.387
I'm calling from NetCom Cable. I understand your
service is out, and there's an appointment set.

401
00:47:39.428 --> 00:47:41.639
Yes. We have a technician
in your area...

402
00:47:41.681 --> 00:47:44.183
who's finished with an appointment
earlier than expected.

403
00:47:44.225 --> 00:47:47.269
- Will somebody be there for the next hour?
- <i>Sure. That'd be great.</i>

404
00:47:47.311 --> 00:47:50.981
<i>All right. Our technician will
see you then. Have a nice day.</i>

405
00:47:51.023 --> 00:47:54.485
Here's all
the paperwork you need.

406
00:47:54.527 --> 00:47:57.821
Just get him to sign and
date at the bottom.

407
00:47:57.863 --> 00:48:02.660
Let's check out the camera.

408
00:48:02.702 --> 00:48:05.872
Stella, you'll
be going patriotic today.

409
00:48:07.582 --> 00:48:11.502
Make sure you walk slowly,
or the image'll streak. Ow.

410
00:48:11.544 --> 00:48:14.337
Ooh. I'm sorry.
It's okay.

411
00:48:14.379 --> 00:48:17.466
Sorry. Couldn't pin the corsage
on my prom date either.

412
00:48:17.508 --> 00:48:20.594
- Oh, you had a prom date?
- Yeah. It was his cousin.

413
00:48:20.635 --> 00:48:23.973
There's cable lines in the
kitchen, living room, bedroom,

414
00:48:24.014 --> 00:48:27.183
and a cable modem on the
computer in the office.

415
00:48:27.225 --> 00:48:30.354
You need to locate the
safe in the office.

416
00:48:30.395 --> 00:48:34.357
- Okay.
- <i>I think you're very brave going in there.</i>

417
00:48:34.399 --> 00:48:37.652
- I know it won't be easy.
- I second that.

418
00:48:39.821 --> 00:48:41.907
It's gonna be fine.

419
00:48:41.949 --> 00:48:45.911
What? You know what
"fine" stands for?

420
00:48:45.953 --> 00:48:50.581
Freaked out, insecure, neurotic and
emotional. Neurotic and emotional.

421
00:48:55.086 --> 00:48:58.840
You'll be great.
Yeah.

422
00:49:09.142 --> 00:49:13.437
Good morning.
Can I see some I.D.?

423
00:49:22.446 --> 00:49:25.282
Thanks for coming so soon.
It's part of the job.

424
00:49:25.324 --> 00:49:27.785
<i>All right.</i>

425
00:49:55.479 --> 00:50:00.650
Aston Martin Vanquish.

426
00:50:00.692 --> 00:50:03.486
Looks like
that bastard took my car.

427
00:50:06.322 --> 00:50:08.950
Nasty-ass dogs.

428
00:50:08.992 --> 00:50:13.120
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

429
00:50:18.001 --> 00:50:20.837
Relax. Jesus Christ.

430
00:50:20.879 --> 00:50:24.590
Come on. They won't
bother you now.

431
00:50:25.508 --> 00:50:27.802
Come on.

432
00:50:27.844 --> 00:50:32.932
House. Go on. Get out of here.

433
00:50:37.352 --> 00:50:40.856
It's okay. I'm used to running into
all sorts of animals on my job.

434
00:50:43.026 --> 00:50:45.528
Steve Frezelli.

435
00:50:47.362 --> 00:50:50.616
Becky.

436
00:50:52.076 --> 00:50:56.621
- Wanna show me that problem?
- Yeah. Of course. This way.

437
00:50:58.083 --> 00:51:03.921
You have a really nice house. Yeah.
1922. All the original tiles.

438
00:51:03.962 --> 00:51:08.592
Every stone in that courtyard hauled
from some monastery in Seville.

439
00:51:08.633 --> 00:51:11.177
What a tactic.

440
00:51:11.219 --> 00:51:14.597
<i>Monastery. Monastery
for punk-ass creeps!</i>

441
00:51:14.639 --> 00:51:17.350
- You don't seem impressed.
- No. It's just that...

442
00:51:17.392 --> 00:51:21.772
I don't think lugging rocks from one place
to another is quite that interesting.

443
00:51:21.813 --> 00:51:27.317
Doesn't quite do it for me.
What does do it for you?

444
00:51:27.359 --> 00:51:32.197
Um... TVs.
I have a monster TV.

445
00:51:32.239 --> 00:51:37.202
- It's not working right now...
- <i>You know, I should probably check out the cable modem.</i>

446
00:51:37.244 --> 00:51:40.582
Yeah? Yeah.
Right. Over here.

447
00:51:42.875 --> 00:51:46.211
I paid 30 grand for some punk
kid to put this system in.

448
00:51:46.253 --> 00:51:50.967
One day, it just goes out.
Ought to have him strung up.

449
00:51:53.343 --> 00:51:56.597
<i>- Here we go.
- There's our baby.</i>

450
00:51:56.639 --> 00:51:58.933
Man.
We got him.

451
00:51:58.975 --> 00:52:02.645
- <i>You got any wiring coming through here?</i>
- There's no wiring in here.

452
00:52:05.106 --> 00:52:06.941
Just right here?
Yeah.

453
00:52:06.983 --> 00:52:11.027
- No explanation.
<i>- Look at that. That's my NAD-T 770.</i>

454
00:52:11.069 --> 00:52:13.280
That's... That's my stereo.

455
00:52:13.321 --> 00:52:18.576
<i>I bet your customers are surprised when
they go to open the door and find you there.</i>

456
00:52:18.618 --> 00:52:21.329
- Oh, yeah.
- He's hitting on her.

457
00:52:21.370 --> 00:52:25.959
There's no problem here. We
should maybe just check the TVs.

458
00:52:26.001 --> 00:52:29.129
Okay.

459
00:52:30.589 --> 00:52:32.423
Know what? I'm gonna
end this shit right now.

460
00:52:32.465 --> 00:52:36.845
I'm blowin' this shit off the mountain.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

461
00:52:41.933 --> 00:52:45.020
- I see you got the A.V.M. processor.
- Only the best.

462
00:52:45.061 --> 00:52:48.148
Check the box.

463
00:52:52.068 --> 00:52:55.238
I'm just gonna
reset your system.

464
00:52:55.279 --> 00:52:59.658
Sometimes these
things just get jammed up, you know?

465
00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:04.288
That should do it.
It's fixed?

466
00:53:04.330 --> 00:53:07.876
- Turn her on. Let's see.
- Now.

467
00:53:07.917 --> 00:53:10.670
Japan's Nikkei index...

468
00:53:10.712 --> 00:53:14.216
Perfect.

469
00:53:17.384 --> 00:53:22.182
Becky, huh?
Have we met before?

470
00:53:24.266 --> 00:53:28.145
No. I don't think so.
If you can just sign there.

471
00:53:28.187 --> 00:53:33.734
If I was to ask you out to dinner, would I
be the first of your customers to do that?

472
00:53:33.775 --> 00:53:36.653
You asked your last cable
repair guy out for a date?

473
00:53:36.695 --> 00:53:40.115
No. But the last one was, like, 300
pounds, had a handlebar mustache.

474
00:53:40.157 --> 00:53:43.576
Not really my type. I don't
think it's a good idea.

475
00:53:43.617 --> 00:53:49.250
What? Is that, like, some cable company
rule? No. Actually, it's my rule.

476
00:53:49.291 --> 00:53:53.836
I don't go out with strange men.
I just met you.

477
00:53:53.878 --> 00:53:58.549
So I guess I have to, like, sabotage my
cable until we get to know each other well.

478
00:54:00.886 --> 00:54:03.679
- Have a nice day.
- Come on.

479
00:54:03.721 --> 00:54:06.766
I'll be a perfect gentleman. Promise. I
won't even ask you for your phone number.

480
00:54:06.807 --> 00:54:10.687
I'll just... I'll meet you
anywhere you wanna go.

481
00:54:10.729 --> 00:54:14.107
Come on.
Break your rule... once.

482
00:54:15.733 --> 00:54:18.986
It's just dinner.

483
00:54:22.573 --> 00:54:25.243
Is that a yes?

484
00:54:35.795 --> 00:54:40.716
You okay?
Yeah.

485
00:54:40.758 --> 00:54:44.010
He touched my hand.

486
00:54:45.262 --> 00:54:48.057
Came onto me.

487
00:54:50.768 --> 00:54:54.688
Hey. At least I created a
window of opportunity, right?

488
00:54:57.275 --> 00:55:01.486
When he goes out Friday night, we go in. By
the time he realizes you've stood him up,

489
00:55:01.527 --> 00:55:06.325
we'll be long gone with our gold.
Yeah.

490
00:55:06.366 --> 00:55:09.452
<i>Make sure you shuffle
them cards this time, Left.</i>

491
00:55:09.494 --> 00:55:13.832
<i>Hey, Lyle. What's the distance
between the front door and the vault?</i>

492
00:55:13.873 --> 00:55:18.086
You got that
loser's paranoia. Lyle!

493
00:55:18.128 --> 00:55:22.048
- He only answers to the "Napster" now, Charlie.
- No.

494
00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:25.510
- I'm not calling you the "Napster."
- Why? You call him "Left Ear."

495
00:55:25.551 --> 00:55:28.180
<i>Well, I am.</i>
And him "Handsome Rob."

496
00:55:28.221 --> 00:55:32.309
- That's because he is Handsome Rob.
- You can call me the "Napster."

497
00:55:32.351 --> 00:55:35.937
Come on. They were at the same
college at the same time.

498
00:55:35.979 --> 00:55:38.939
- Why are you encouraging this?
<i>- It is a fact.</i>

499
00:55:38.981 --> 00:55:43.777
<i>He was my roommate. He stole my ideas.
I am the Napster.</i>

500
00:55:44.737 --> 00:55:47.157
All right.
All right.

501
00:55:47.199 --> 00:55:50.909
What is the distance between the
front door and the vault, Napster?

502
00:55:52.995 --> 00:55:55.455
Farther than you wanna carry it.

503
00:55:55.497 --> 00:55:59.626
Yeah, but so how do we get the gold
from the vault to the getaway car?

504
00:55:59.668 --> 00:56:04.215
How wide is the hallway,
Napster?

505
00:56:05.507 --> 00:56:09.303
Six feet.

506
00:56:25.443 --> 00:56:29.865
Okay.
You got your gold.

507
00:57:27.963 --> 00:57:30.882
We're going to need more
cars to handle the weight.

508
00:57:30.924 --> 00:57:35.553
Looks like I'm gonna need some help with the
custom work too. I know a man for the job.

509
00:57:35.595 --> 00:57:38.474
<i>So I modified the camera to
include the lidar technology...</i>

510
00:57:38.515 --> 00:57:42.060
so we can create really
high-res digital maps.

511
00:57:42.102 --> 00:57:44.396
Who's that?
Rob's mechanic friend.

512
00:57:49.276 --> 00:57:51.236
Hey, Charlie.
Hey.

513
00:57:51.278 --> 00:57:54.196
Charlie, this is Wrench.
Hey, what's up, man?

514
00:57:54.238 --> 00:57:58.660
Rob tells me you got real talent.
I need some body work done.

515
00:57:58.701 --> 00:58:01.578
<i>I need to pack up to 2,700 pounds
of cargo in these Minis...</i>

516
00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:05.541
with enough suspension and horsepower
to outrun anything chasin' us.

517
00:58:05.582 --> 00:58:09.879
2,700 pounds of what?
Whatever.

518
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:15.426
- So what do I get out of this mystery deal, man?
- 10,000.

519
00:58:17.429 --> 00:58:20.140

530
00:59:48.141 --> 00:59:51.937
Welcome to L.A.'s Automated Traffic
Surveillance and Control Operation Center.

531
00:59:51.978 --> 00:59:55.442
See, they use video feeds from intersections,
and specifically designed algorithms...

532
00:59:55.483 --> 00:59:58.902
<i>to predict traffic conditions, and
thereby control traffic lights.</i>

533
00:59:58.944 --> 01:00:03.449

kick-ass algorithms to sneak in,

Yeah.

Unnecessary engine parts.

01:00:46.617 --> 01:00:50.370

You're early.
I'm in a hurry.

565
01:01:57.394 --> 01:02:00.605
Of course you know that the Florida vote
rigging was a CIA and mob operation.

566
01:02:00.647 --> 01:02:02.982
Is that so? Yeah, which is
not so very different...

567
01:02:03.024 --> 01:02:07.110
from when John F. Kennedy won a rigged
election with the help of his father.

568
01:02:07.152 --> 01:02:09.113
You're uncomfortable
when I mention J.F.K.

569
01:02:09.155 --> 01:02:11.114
No, Yevhen. I don't
like making two trips.

01:02:11.156 --> 01:02:15.579
You Americans.
You love your heroes.

571

A holiday for Columbus?

572
01:02:18.039 --> 01:02:22.167
He makes the wrong turn and wipes
out an entire indigenous people.

573
01:02:22.209 --> 01:02:25.295
And you know what he was looking for?
I bet you're gonna tell me.

574
01:02:25.337 --> 01:02:28.006
Gold. Supposedly
for Queen Isabella,

575
01:02:28.049 --> 01:02:31.510
but don't think that the Medicis back in
Italy didn't want a part of that action.

576
01:02:31.552 --> 01:02:33.763
And what did Italy
need gold for?

577
01:02:33.804 --> 01:02:38.517
For the long distance
slave trade based in Venice.

578
01:02:38.559 --> 01:02:42.062
Venice. That's where
these bricks...

579
01:02:46.567 --> 01:02:48.694
You were saying something?
Nothing. No.

580
01:02:48.736 --> 01:02:52.113
No, you were really on a roll there.
Don't stop. I'm interested.

581
01:02:52.154 --> 01:02:56.535
Please. I-I'm confused.
My English...

582
01:02:56.577 --> 01:02:59.204
You understand fine. Now, what
do you know about my gold?

583
01:02:59.246 --> 01:03:01.873
No. I don't... Don't you even
think about lying to me.

584
01:03:01.915 --> 01:03:04.959
Okay. Okay. I...
I heard a rumor...

585
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.378
about a heist in Venice.

586
01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:09.548
Thirty five million in bricks,

587
01:03:09.590 --> 01:03:11.883
with an imprint of a
Balinese dancer on them.

588
01:03:11.925 --> 01:03:13.635
Who've you told?
No one.

589
01:03:13.676 --> 01:03:16.930
Who have you told? No one!
No one, I swear to God!

590
01:03:18.931 --> 01:03:20.975
You swear to God?

591
01:03:21.016 --> 01:03:23.436
You crazy? I swear to God.
I didn't.

592
01:03:23.478 --> 01:03:26.606
Well then,
I guess I believe you.

593
01:03:56.677 --> 01:03:59.262
Yevhen?

594
01:04:00.096 --> 01:04:02.557
Yevhen?

595
01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:18.531
Whoa, man!

596
01:04:18.573 --> 01:04:20.868
Let's putt it this time.

597
01:04:20.909 --> 01:04:22.994
<i>Putt, not drive.</i>

598
01:04:23.036 --> 01:04:24.787
Very good.

599
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:27.498
You can get it. I know you can.
I know you can do it.

600
01:04:27.541 --> 01:04:31.461
<i>Much better.</i>
Here to see Skinny Pete.

601
01:04:31.503 --> 01:04:34.506
Yeah, he's over there.
Thanks, man.

602
01:04:36.423 --> 01:04:38.468
Don't stare.
Huh?

603
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:42.680
Don't stare. He doesn't like when
people stare. Stare at what?

604
01:04:42.722 --> 01:04:46.976
That was good. That was good. Try that one.
I know you're gonna get that one.

605
01:04:47.018 --> 01:04:49.102

How's it going?

608
01:04:53.816 --> 01:04:55.985
So, was I right about the
gold bricks, or what?

609
01:04:56.027 --> 01:05:00.406
Aw, I'm not here to talk about that.

610
01:05:00.447 --> 01:05:02.742

611
01:05:02.783 --> 01:05:04.828
Go relax.

612
01:05:06.704 --> 01:05:09.873
Hmm.

613
01:05:09.915 --> 01:05:13.126
Yo.<i> Yo.</i>

614
01:05:13.168 --> 01:05:15.588
- Supplies.
- What's wrong?

615
01:05:15.629 --> 01:05:20.968
Huh? Uh... Uh, some, uh...
Some Nitramin.

616
01:05:22.468 --> 01:05:26.180
Uh, some, uh...
Some Nitramin, primer...

617
01:05:26.222 --> 01:05:28.183
- What's wrong?
- Huh? - Yo.

618
01:05:28.225 --> 01:05:30.393
Uh, nothing. I-I'm cool.
I-I'm great.

619
01:05:30.435 --> 01:05:32.979
Uh, I just need some, uh...
big can, uh...

620
01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:35.356
Nitramin, primer, detonating cord, Right.
Right, right.

621
01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:37.442
Two triple charger chemical
grenades and a launcher.

622
01:05:37.483 --> 01:05:40.528
Right. Like I had told you...
earlier.

623
01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:43.990
All right.

624
01:05:47.869 --> 01:05:49.830
Cost you about five Gs.

625
01:05:49.872 --> 01:05:51.957
Done.
Call me.

626
01:05:53.249 --> 01:05:56.878
Thanks, man. Sorry.
A-A-All right, man.

627
01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.964
Peace.
Come on.

628
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:18.691
Get out.

629
01:06:18.733 --> 01:06:20.819
There.

630
01:06:29.117 --> 01:06:33.413
Vance has something to tell you.

631
01:06:34.623 --> 01:06:37.626
Go on.

632
01:06:37.668 --> 01:06:41.213
A couple weeks back...

633
01:06:41.255 --> 01:06:43.841
I was working counter
of your cousin's shop.

634
01:06:43.882 --> 01:06:48.595
A guy come in, was asking about
gold bricks, with Balinese dancers.

635
01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:54.017
What did you tell him? I told
him that I'd seen the bricks.

636
01:06:58.063 --> 01:07:01.025
I'm sorry.

637
01:07:01.066 --> 01:07:04.653
What did this man look like?

638
01:07:04.695 --> 01:07:10.449
He had, uh, long, black hair,
big tattoo on his neck.

639
01:07:13.202 --> 01:07:17.790
- He must have weighed at least 400 pounds.
- I know that guy.

640
01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:49.405
Baby, go relax.

641
01:07:58.664 --> 01:08:02.751
- Do you know who I am?
- You're Mashkov.

642
01:08:02.792 --> 01:08:06.504
That's right. You were
asking about gold bricks...

643
01:08:06.546 --> 01:08:09.340
with a Balinese dancer on them.

644
01:08:09.382 --> 01:08:14.763
Tell me why.

645
01:08:19.059 --> 01:08:22.437
Steve just called to confirm his
8:00 reservation at the Water Grill.

646
01:08:22.478 --> 01:08:24.397
Okay. Let's go over it
one more time.

647
01:08:24.439 --> 01:08:27.109
Gas the guards,
doors open 8:15.

648
01:08:27.150 --> 01:08:31.195
Safe popped by 8:25. Loaded by 8:35.
Out the door by 8:45.

649
01:08:31.237 --> 01:08:33.865
Straight to Union Station. Only
green lights on your route.

650
01:08:33.907 --> 01:08:37.243
The rest of the city's red. Cops are
stuck in traffic like everyone else.

651
01:08:37.285 --> 01:08:40.705
Train leaves at 10:00. Cars have
to be on the carrier by 9:30.

652
01:08:40.747 --> 01:08:43.206
Timing's gotta be dead on.

653
01:08:43.248 --> 01:08:45.919
Let's get ready.
Let's get it.

654
01:09:16.281 --> 01:09:22.579
Wow. That is a nice car. Sorry, Rob.
Coast is clear, guys.

655
01:09:33.966 --> 01:09:36.468
This is it, guys...
the moment of truth.

656
01:09:38.052 --> 01:09:40.471
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

657
01:09:40.513 --> 01:09:42.891
Shit!

658
01:09:42.932 --> 01:09:47.436
Steve's neighbor's
throwing a party.

659
01:09:47.478 --> 01:09:50.523
Are you
here for the Baker party, sir?

660
01:09:50.564 --> 01:09:54.485
No.

661
01:09:54.527 --> 01:09:56.487
We're not blowing
any gates tonight, guys.

662
01:09:56.530 --> 01:09:59.657
Too many witnesses. Stella...

663
01:10:00.449 --> 01:10:02.827
I know. I know.

664
01:10:03.661 --> 01:10:05.663
I'm late for my date.

665
01:10:05.705 --> 01:10:08.749
Yeah, and you gotta be charming.

666
01:10:08.791 --> 01:10:11.502
You need him
to ask you out again. Sorry.

667
01:10:16.674 --> 01:10:20.510
<i>I really can't
imagine you doing that.</i>

668
01:10:20.552 --> 01:10:22.555
<i>What's that supposed to mean?</i>

669
01:10:22.596 --> 01:10:27.184
Well, you don't really seem like
the adventurous type, you know?

670
01:10:27.226 --> 01:10:32.940
Don't let the cable uniform, you know,
throw you. I wasn't making assumptions.

671
01:10:32.982 --> 01:10:35.359
I've made some
assumptions about you.

672
01:10:35.401 --> 01:10:38.319
Oh, really?

673
01:10:38.361 --> 01:10:41.489
And?

674
01:10:41.532 --> 01:10:44.743
Mmm. You're just gonna
have to wait and see.

675
01:10:44.784 --> 01:10:48.163
Mmm.

676
01:10:50.665 --> 01:10:52.709
Why wait?
Let's get a check.

677
01:10:52.751 --> 01:10:56.504
Let's go back to my place. No assumptions.
Not tonight.

678
01:10:56.546 --> 01:10:58.882
It's late.
I should go home.

679
01:10:58.924 --> 01:11:01.676
What, do you have a cable
company curfew? No,

680
01:11:01.718 --> 01:11:05.931
but I've made
some bad calls in the past.

681
01:11:05.972 --> 01:11:08.432
Hey... We should take this maybe
a little slower, you know?

682
01:11:08.473 --> 01:11:12.645
This lovely dinner, sparkling
conversation, you still don't trust me?

683
01:11:12.687 --> 01:11:16.524
Oh, no.
I trust everyone.

684
01:11:16.566 --> 01:11:20.112
It's the devil inside
them I don't trust.

685
01:11:24.241 --> 01:11:29.204
An interesting saying. It's charming.
Where'd you pick that up?

686
01:11:29.246 --> 01:11:31.748
Can't remember.
Really?

687
01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:34.041
I knew a guy who said it
exactly like that.

688
01:11:34.083 --> 01:11:36.294
Really?
Yeah.

689
01:11:36.335 --> 01:11:39.546
He was the only person I've ever heard
say that. He said it all the time.

690
01:11:39.588 --> 01:11:43.217
His name was John Bridger.

691
01:11:43.259 --> 01:11:47.096
You're hurting my wrist. He had a daughter.
She was your age.

692
01:11:50.349 --> 01:11:55.979
Let go of my wrist. I knew that there
was something familiar about you.

693
01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:58.107
You're exactly like
your old man, you know that?

694
01:11:58.149 --> 01:12:00.192
I liked him too,
right from the start.

695
01:12:00.234 --> 01:12:03.154
I liked him right up until
the minute I shot him.

696
01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:08.159
Who are you working with?

697
01:12:12.703 --> 01:12:15.706
She's with us.

698
01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:29.971
- Gang's all here.
- You know the only thing worse than a thief, Bandell?

699
01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:31.555
A coward.

700
01:12:31.597 --> 01:12:36.602
Then you should've seen the way
your daddy begged for his life.

701
01:12:36.644 --> 01:12:40.772
- It's not worth it.
- Put a leash on your cat.

702
01:12:45.986 --> 01:12:50.782
Hey, Steve.
Charlie.

703
01:12:50.824 --> 01:12:52.785
Not bad, Charlie.
Really. Not bad.

704
01:12:52.827 --> 01:12:57.039
You have no idea how hard it is for
me not to reach across this table...

705
01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:58.790
and kill you with my bare hands.

706
01:12:58.832 --> 01:13:02.419
You know better than that, Charlie.
Can't let emotion into these things.

707
01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:06.298
Tell me it wasn't about emotion when you
shot John and left us all for dead.

708
01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:09.676
That wasn't about emotion. It was
about a lot of gold, and I wanted it.

709
01:13:09.718 --> 01:13:11.720
Anything you think
you deserved, you didn't.

710
01:13:11.761 --> 01:13:15.974
Hey, don't talk about right and wrong with
me, man, 'cause I just don't give a shit.

711
01:13:16.016 --> 01:13:17.809
Okay?

712
01:13:17.851 --> 01:13:22.647
You got your cards. I got my cards. We
made our play and I came out on top.

713
01:13:22.689 --> 01:13:25.192
Now, if you wanna start
the game up again,

714
01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:27.276
that's fine with me.

715
01:13:27.319 --> 01:13:30.905
What... I mean, what is your
play here, really?

716
01:13:30.946 --> 01:13:33.825
I mean, come on.
What do ya think?

717
01:13:33.867 --> 01:13:36.328
You'll try to take out
my guards, right?

718
01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:38.413
I have five of 'em
that you don't know about.

719
01:13:38.454 --> 01:13:42.417
You'll try to have Lyle hack the system?
I'll change it again tomorrow morning.

720
01:13:42.458 --> 01:13:45.002
W-W-What was your final move?

721
01:13:45.044 --> 01:13:50.341
I mean, you were gonna have Bridger's
daughter come in and try to crack my safe?

722
01:13:50.383 --> 01:13:54.136
I mean, that's... that's very poetic
and all, but I just don't see it.

723
01:13:54.178 --> 01:13:56.431
I don't think she'll
get anywhere near it.

724
01:13:56.472 --> 01:14:01.352
Same old Steve, huh? Always thinking defensively.
That's why you were always number two.

725
01:14:01.394 --> 01:14:04.980
How do you figure that?
You got no imagination.

726
01:14:05.022 --> 01:14:09.526
Couldn't even decide what to do with all that
money. You had to buy what everybody else wanted.

727
01:14:09.568 --> 01:14:14.490
Oh, well, try this on in your imagination,
okay? That gold is already gone.

728
01:14:14.531 --> 01:14:17.200
That's bullshit, Steve. No, really.
It's over, Charlie.

729
01:14:17.242 --> 01:14:19.161
I'm tryin' to move
the last two bricks.

730
01:14:19.203 --> 01:14:23.874
You wanna come after me over a couple lousy
bricks? I mean, really. Be my guest.

731
01:14:23.916 --> 01:14:26.042
But you're off to a bad start.
You know?

732
01:14:26.084 --> 01:14:30.798
You just blew the best thing you had going for
you. You just blew the element of surprise.

733
01:14:31.423 --> 01:14:34.050
Oh!

734
01:14:34.092 --> 01:14:37.429
Surprised?

735
01:14:38.930 --> 01:14:41.892
It's over when I say it's over.

736
01:14:43.643 --> 01:14:46.981
Are you all right, sir?

737
01:15:17.969 --> 01:15:20.805
How you doin'?

738
01:15:20.847 --> 01:15:24.309
Good,

739
01:15:24.351 --> 01:15:26.726
considering...

740
01:15:26.768 --> 01:15:30.397
considering the fact that I'm doing
all of this for a man I barely knew.

741
01:15:38.071 --> 01:15:42.451
You know what bothered me
all those years, Charlie?

742
01:15:42.493 --> 01:15:44.703
It was that...

743
01:15:44.744 --> 01:15:47.956
whenever he'd call me to tell me
that he was on some job,

744
01:15:47.998 --> 01:15:52.002
I knew you were
right there with him.

745
01:15:55.381 --> 01:15:57.465
You got to know him
a lot better than I did.

746
01:15:57.507 --> 01:16:03.055
Just 'cause he was around me more doesn't mean
he wasn't thinking about you all the time.

747
01:16:03.096 --> 01:16:06.641
Be nice if it was true.
It is true.

748
01:16:06.683 --> 01:16:11.229
He always regretted not having been a
good enough father to you, Stella.

749
01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:15.400
How do you know that?

750
01:16:15.441 --> 01:16:18.027
Because he told me.

751
01:16:24.826 --> 01:16:28.287
What did you do to your hand?

752
01:16:29.789 --> 01:16:34.544
I punched Steve. And why do you
get to punch him and I don't?

753
01:16:37.838 --> 01:16:40.048
Those hands are way to valuable.

754
01:16:47.181 --> 01:16:49.308
Hey.

755
01:16:54.230 --> 01:16:56.941
Okay?

756
01:17:03.947 --> 01:17:10.287
There'll be nothing left of
that if you keep rubbing it.

757
01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:15.500
Tell Mr. Frezelli
we'll see him at 8:00.

758
01:17:15.542 --> 01:17:17.835
<i>Charlie?</i>

759
01:17:17.877 --> 01:17:20.631
He's flying the coop.

760
01:17:21.548 --> 01:17:24.259
- When?
- His security guard called...

761
01:17:24.301 --> 01:17:26.470
<i>for a private helicopter
at 4:00 p.m.</i>

762
01:17:26.511 --> 01:17:28.888
There's an armored car service
coming to his house at 5:00.

763
01:17:28.930 --> 01:17:34.311
<i>There is a cargo plane, scheduled to
depart LAX at 8:00 p.m. to Mexico City.</i>

764
01:17:34.352 --> 01:17:37.647
<i>What if he's moving
the safe as a diversion?</i>

765
01:17:37.688 --> 01:17:40.357
We crack it, it's empty,
the gold's somewhere else.

766
01:17:40.399 --> 01:17:42.652
Steve's not about to let
that gold out of his sight.

767
01:17:42.693 --> 01:17:45.863
It's gonna be in that truck. He's gonna
be watching it from the helicopter.

768
01:17:45.905 --> 01:17:47.864
So, the gold's headed to Mexico.

769
01:17:47.906 --> 01:17:50.493
Who knows where? They could change the
flight plan in mid... Slow down. Slow down.

770
01:17:50.534 --> 01:17:53.664
You are lookin' at this the wrong way.
This is good news for us.

771
01:17:53.705 --> 01:17:56.499
- What do you mean "good news"?
- We've been trying to get to the safe.

772
01:17:56.540 --> 01:17:59.293
Now the safe is coming to us.
We're gonna boost it in transit.

773
01:17:59.335 --> 01:18:03.422
<i>He could take a dozen different routes to
the airport. We have no idea which one.</i>

774
01:18:03.464 --> 01:18:05.966
<i>We can't take out an armored
truck during rush hour.</i>

775
01:18:06.008 --> 01:18:08.385
We're already set up to do it.

776
01:18:08.427 --> 01:18:12.264
<i>Napster, gridlock every route
except for the one we choose.</i>

777
01:18:12.306 --> 01:18:14.642
Force that truck to go exactly
the way we want it to go.

778
01:18:14.684 --> 01:18:18.812
Where<i> do</i> we want it to go? We can't have
a shoot-out without guns. We'd lose.

779
01:18:18.854 --> 01:18:21.940
We'll do it
like the Italian job.

780
01:18:27.737 --> 01:18:29.573
- Hello?
- Why'd you do it?

781
01:18:29.615 --> 01:18:33.243
- Do what?
- Yevhen. You didn't have to clip him.

782
01:18:33.285 --> 01:18:36.288
Whoa. What are you talking
about? We didn't clip anybody.

783
01:18:36.330 --> 01:18:39.123
Yevhen's cousin is under the
distinct impression that you did.

784
01:18:39.165 --> 01:18:41.418
Why does he think that?
Because you wanted to know...

785
01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:43.419
about the gold
with the Balinese dancer.

786
01:18:43.462 --> 01:18:46.131
You told him that?
Listen to me, man.

787
01:18:46.173 --> 01:18:48.174
If there's one thing
that I know,

788
01:18:48.216 --> 01:18:52.555
it's never to mess with Mother Nature,
mother-in-laws or mother-freaking-Ukrainians.

789
01:18:52.596 --> 01:18:57.475
Look, I need a favor.

790
01:19:22.417 --> 01:19:25.627
- Yeah?
- I had a hiccup last night. Could use some help.

791
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:28.923
More hands-on this time. You interested?
Could be.

792
01:19:28.964 --> 01:19:34.011
But, I don't like to be kept
in the dark. If I'm in, I'm in.

793
01:19:34.053 --> 01:19:38.640
Okay. You're in.
All right.

794
01:19:40.601 --> 01:19:42.771
What do ya think, Charlie?
This'll work.

795
01:19:42.812 --> 01:19:45.147
Let's go.

796
01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:59.327
<i>You're amazing. It's a
work of genius. Uh-huh.</i>

797
01:20:06.167 --> 01:20:09.755
You okay?
Just give me a moment.

798
01:20:09.797 --> 01:20:11.714
Now?

799
01:20:11.756 --> 01:20:15.843
I'm about to insert this pin
into this detonator tube,

800
01:20:15.884 --> 01:20:20.140
and if the brass touches the sides, we'll
both be the last people we ever see.

801
01:20:21.932 --> 01:20:24.685
Take all the time you need.

802
01:20:27.938 --> 01:20:30.483
Hey, Charlie.
What?

803
01:20:32.276 --> 01:20:35.195
I love you, man.

804
01:20:35.904 --> 01:20:38.324
I love you too.

805
01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:44.413
Okay. Okay.

806
01:20:53.714 --> 01:20:57.593
<i>Your attention, please.
Metrolink train number 774...</i>

807
01:20:57.635 --> 01:21:00.637
<i>will arrive
in approximately 15 minutes.</i>

808
01:21:16.445 --> 01:21:19.198
Check positions.
Napster?

809
01:21:19.239 --> 01:21:21.949
I'm in position.

810
01:21:21.991 --> 01:21:28.373
- Handsome Rob?
- We're in position. Everything's quiet here.

811
01:21:30.124 --> 01:21:34.212
Wrench?
Set.

812
01:21:49.685 --> 01:21:51.646
Charlie, we've got
an uninvited visitor.

813
01:21:51.688 --> 01:21:54.648
There's a motorcycle guard
following the truck.

814
01:21:54.690 --> 01:21:57.317
We'll deal with it.

815
01:22:01.656 --> 01:22:05.116
- Who are these cats?
<i>- What's wrong?</i>

816
01:22:05.158 --> 01:22:09.037
<i>Charlie, you won't believe this. He's
brought in three armored trucks.</i>

817
01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:12.332
It's a shell game.
Shell game now.

818
01:22:12.374 --> 01:22:16.002
Well, boss, I can't reroute the truck
if I don't know which truck to reroute.

819
01:22:16.044 --> 01:22:18.756
<i>Go with the one Steve
follows with the helicopter.</i>

820
01:22:18.797 --> 01:22:21.466
Remember he said he'd never
let that gold out of his sight.

821
01:22:21.508 --> 01:22:23.552
Unless he's playing us,
and he is.

822
01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:38.943
Okay, let's move!
Movin' out!

823
01:22:51.328 --> 01:22:54.582
Here we go.
They're pulling out.

824
01:22:54.624 --> 01:22:59.254
Napster? Pull up the traffic
cameras you're watching.

825
01:22:59.296 --> 01:23:04.884
<i>Where's the first camera
the trucks go past?</i>

826
01:23:04.926 --> 01:23:08.053
Vine and Yucca.
They're all gonna cross there.

827
01:23:08.095 --> 01:23:10.514
See which one's riding low.

828
01:23:21.150 --> 01:23:25.029
First one wasn't it.

829
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:28.531
The first two
are the same, so...

830
01:23:30.826 --> 01:23:34.288
Houston, we have our truck.
It is number 128.

831
01:23:42.796 --> 01:23:45.841
We're moving out.

832
01:23:45.882 --> 01:23:49.678
<i>Three kilo fox to two fox
mike, we're heading to the airport.</i>

833
01:24:02.732 --> 01:24:08.905
Hmm. Okay, guys. Truck 128
has turned right, heading west.

834
01:24:08.947 --> 01:24:11.574
Gridlock time.

835
01:24:19.999 --> 01:24:23.045
We've crashed!

836
01:24:23.086 --> 01:24:25.128
It's not a crash.

837
01:24:25.170 --> 01:24:27.506
We've got power.

838
01:24:28.091 --> 01:24:29.800
I can't log in.

839
01:24:29.842 --> 01:24:34.763
They are about to hit a major
detour and be sent your way.

840
01:24:41.353 --> 01:24:43.689
Oops.

841
01:24:46.734 --> 01:24:50.071
You'll... never... shut down...

842
01:24:50.112 --> 01:24:53.115
the<i> real...</i> Napster.

843
01:24:55.034 --> 01:24:57.119
<i>What's going on?</i>

844
01:25:00.581 --> 01:25:04.376
What's your problem?

845
01:25:08.296 --> 01:25:10.382
<i>Truck 128,
what is your progress?</i>

846
01:25:10.424 --> 01:25:16.137
<i>This is truck 128. Traffic's outta control
here.</i> We gotta look for another route.

847
01:25:17.222 --> 01:25:19.433
Check the police band.

848
01:25:19.474 --> 01:25:24.020
Okay, I'm opening up
a space on Highland.

849
01:25:25.605 --> 01:25:28.608
Oh, get us outta here.
I'm tryin'.

850
01:25:33.195 --> 01:25:35.615
And he's takin' it.

851
01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:43.706
Police scanners are saying computers
are down in Traffic Control Center.

852
01:25:43.748 --> 01:25:49.170
Nice, Charlie.
What are you up to?

853
01:25:49.211 --> 01:25:51.756
Go back.

854
01:25:59.555 --> 01:26:02.100
I now command you to turn left.

855
01:26:03.767 --> 01:26:07.479
Come on, take the left!

856
01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:10.817
Yeah, you did. You did.

857
01:26:44.474 --> 01:26:46.185
Give us the flag.

858
01:26:46.225 --> 01:26:50.437
Metro just passed through the station.
You are clear for 90 seconds.

859
01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:53.233
<i>Go.</i>

860
01:27:08.122 --> 01:27:10.541
Come on, Steve.

861
01:27:25.639 --> 01:27:28.559
Whoa! Whoa!

862
01:27:33.522 --> 01:27:36.607
Thirty seconds and counting.

863
01:27:41.947 --> 01:27:44.867
Fifteen seconds. You're either blocked
in or you're paint on the train.

864
01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:52.665
Go. Go. Go! Go! Go!

865
01:27:52.707 --> 01:27:55.543
Stay right on me.
This is gonna be tight!

866
01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:02.717
Go! Go! Go!

867
01:28:02.759 --> 01:28:06.763
You're gonna stop right there.

868
01:28:42.632 --> 01:28:46.219
Okay, guys.
Coming into position.

869
01:28:46.261 --> 01:28:49.096
Stay cool.

870
01:28:59.606 --> 01:29:03.193
Ten, nine,

871
01:29:03.235 --> 01:29:06.654
<i>eight, seven,</i>

872
01:29:06.695 --> 01:29:09.783
six, five,

873
01:29:09.825 --> 01:29:12.452
- four...
- Don't lose him. Don't lose him!

874
01:29:12.494 --> 01:29:16.914
Three, two,

875
01:29:16.956 --> 01:29:20.002
<i>one.</i>

876
01:29:23.630 --> 01:29:26.133
What?
What?

877
01:29:36.684 --> 01:29:41.147
Damn.

878
01:29:47.362 --> 01:29:51.407
<i>Where's my truck? What the
fuck happened to my truck?</i>

879
01:29:55.451 --> 01:29:59.247
- It just blew right through the street!
- Well, get under there!

880
01:30:11.219 --> 01:30:14.221
- We have another problem, guys.
- What?

881
01:30:14.262 --> 01:30:18.308
- This isn't the Worthington 1,000.
- What?

882
01:30:18.350 --> 01:30:22.813
- He switched safes on us.
- Can you do it?

883
01:30:22.855 --> 01:30:25.940
It's Israeli made. It's got
a glass relock system.

884
01:30:25.982 --> 01:30:27.942
There's a pane of glass
right here behind this door,

885
01:30:27.984 --> 01:30:29.944
and if I don't drill
perfectly through that hole,

886
01:30:29.986 --> 01:30:32.865
steel rods snap into place
and you can't open the safe.

887
01:30:32.906 --> 01:30:35.200
<i>Then we're up shit creek.</i>

888
01:31:04.062 --> 01:31:08.900
I think I just
cracked the glass.

889
01:31:08.942 --> 01:31:13.779
I don't think it broke, though.
I can't drill it again.

890
01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:16.740
I have to do it by touch.

891
01:31:18.533 --> 01:31:21.328
I can't get through.
The train's blocking the tunnel.

892
01:31:21.370 --> 01:31:24.290
- Quick, where does the Metro Rail come above ground?
- Eleventh and Fig.

893
01:31:24.331 --> 01:31:27.918
Positions two and three,
meet at 11th and Figueroa.

894
01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:31.088
<i>Double back to Hollywood
and Highland. Hurry up!</i>

895
01:31:44.226 --> 01:31:46.520
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

896
01:31:46.561 --> 01:31:48.855
<i>Baggage for train number 22...</i>

897
01:31:48.897 --> 01:31:52.609
<i>is now available
at carousel number four.</i>

898
01:31:52.651 --> 01:31:56.946
<i>Baggage for train number 22 is
now available at carousel four.</i>

899
01:32:29.979 --> 01:32:32.022
I can't do this, Charlie.
Stella.

900
01:32:32.063 --> 01:32:35.318
I can't do it. I need a drill, a borescope,
something. I need to get<i> in</i> there.

901
01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:38.445
- You don't need any of that.
- Come on, Charlie.

902
01:32:38.487 --> 01:32:40.864
Hey, you can do this.

903
01:33:35.876 --> 01:33:38.462
- Slide.
- Come on. Come on.

904
01:33:44.552 --> 01:33:48.680
Hey! Don't you want
to see what's inside?

905
01:33:48.722 --> 01:33:51.058
Absolutely.

906
01:33:53.894 --> 01:33:56.188
<i>Napster. Yeah.</i>

907
01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:58.982
Thirteen across,
four high, four deep.

908
01:34:00.192 --> 01:34:02.528
That's, uh, 208 bricks.

909
01:34:02.570 --> 01:34:07.575
- How much?
- Oh, uh, 208 times 27...

910
01:34:09.285 --> 01:34:11.412
Two point seven...
Two point seven million.

911
01:34:11.454 --> 01:34:13.247
What?

912
01:34:13.289 --> 01:34:17.751
No, it's 27. It's 27 million.
It's $27 million worth of gold!

913
01:34:17.793 --> 01:34:21.003
Ha ha!

914
01:34:22.005 --> 01:34:24.383
Yeah!

915
01:34:25.133 --> 01:34:29.220
Got the... holy spirit.

916
01:34:29.263 --> 01:34:31.932
You should get on it.
It's a good train.

917
01:34:47.029 --> 01:34:49.449
Ha ha ha!

918
01:35:08.134 --> 01:35:10.595
What did you think, John?

919
01:35:18.311 --> 01:35:21.313
<i>Twenty seven million.</i>

920
01:35:21.355 --> 01:35:23.940
<i>Say it again. Say it again!
Twenty seven million.</i>

921
01:35:23.982 --> 01:35:25.901
Say it<i> again!</i>
Twenty seven million!

922
01:35:25.943 --> 01:35:28.612
<i>Say it again!</i>

923
01:35:50.467 --> 01:35:53.720
There are two motorcycles
on us, Charlie.

924
01:35:55.514 --> 01:35:59.016
I got three Minis in a storm drain
heading east towards the L.A. River.

925
01:35:59.058 --> 01:36:02.062
Stop them before
they get to the street.

926
01:36:05.857 --> 01:36:08.318
Damn it!

927
01:36:11.029 --> 01:36:13.239
Whoa!

928
01:36:25.834 --> 01:36:28.087
Here we go!

929
01:36:35.928 --> 01:36:38.222
Whoo!

930
01:36:38.722 --> 01:36:40.808
Rob, whoa!

931
01:36:41.934 --> 01:36:44.478
Open your door!

932
01:36:47.814 --> 01:36:50.316
<i>Come on, guys!
We're moving.</i>

933
01:36:55.196 --> 01:36:58.074
There. There, there,
there, there, there.

934
01:37:06.166 --> 01:37:09.335
Hey! Come on! Come on! Look out!

935
01:37:36.445 --> 01:37:39.323
Come on!

936
01:37:44.536 --> 01:37:47.290
Where you goin'?
Where you goin'?

937
01:38:06.016 --> 01:38:09.895
I'm gonna take Steve. You guys go straight
to Union Station. I'll meet you there.

938
01:38:10.979 --> 01:38:14.399
Stay on him.
Stay on him!

939
01:38:20.781 --> 01:38:24.325
Okay, Charlie. I'm opening up
a spot on lower Grand.

940
01:38:26.328 --> 01:38:29.246
<i>I know it's you, Charlie.</i>

941
01:38:30.122 --> 01:38:32.876
Take the next left.

942
01:39:29.472 --> 01:39:32.560
Nice move, Steve.

943
01:40:11.514 --> 01:40:13.515
Get out! Get out! Okay!

944
01:40:13.557 --> 01:40:16.644
I said, "Get<i> out!"</i>

945
01:41:49.818 --> 01:41:52.487
They got a bunch
of cars in there, right?

946
01:41:52.529 --> 01:41:54.322
Mini Coopers?
Look, man.

947
01:41:54.364 --> 01:41:57.076
I don't know anything... Hey, hey, hey.
Don't worry about them.

948
01:41:57.117 --> 01:42:00.787
I'll give you five grand if
you put me inside that car.

949
01:42:04.457 --> 01:42:06.710
Buy your girlfriend
something nice.

950
01:42:12.382 --> 01:42:14.718
Come on.

951
01:42:18.764 --> 01:42:22.058
Half now, half when you
help me unload.

952
01:42:25.395 --> 01:42:30.649
I gotta hand it to you, Steve. You
actually played this one pretty smart.

953
01:42:30.691 --> 01:42:36.698
Decoy trucks, switched safes, helicopter
routine... I mean, that was pretty damn good.

954
01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:40.410
But now I've got the gold,
and you? You've got nothing.

955
01:42:40.452 --> 01:42:42.536
I got this, so cut the crap,

956
01:42:42.578 --> 01:42:45.582
and gimme my goddamn gold!

957
01:42:58.385 --> 01:43:00.096
Who the hell are you?

958
01:43:00.138 --> 01:43:04.266
I am Mashkov, and you
killed my cousin Yevhen.

959
01:43:04.308 --> 01:43:06.226
Gotta have
some insurance, Steve.

960
01:43:16.027 --> 01:43:18.362
Yevhen was already dead
when I got there.

961
01:43:18.404 --> 01:43:22.450
I'm sorry 'bout that. Yevhen dealt with
unsavory people. This guy's tryin' to play you.

962
01:43:22.492 --> 01:43:24.494
You are right...

963
01:43:24.535 --> 01:43:26.789
no imagination.

964
01:43:29.499 --> 01:43:34.172
There's a lot of gold in there. We're the only
