00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.375
Hello.

2
00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:47.959
Hello, sweetie.

3
00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:49.753
Daddy.

4
00:02:51.088 --> 00:02:52.464
It's early.

5
00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:53.965
Yeah, I know.

6
00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:56.718
I just wanted to let you know
I'm sending you something.

7
00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.429
Does it smell nice?

8
00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:02.349
No, but it's sparkly.

9
00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:05.727
Does it have a receipt?

10
00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:09.564
I'm sending it to you from the store.

11
00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.028
Why don't you just come by?
We'll have some breakfast.

12
00:03:15.112 --> 00:03:17.114
Well, it'd be a long trip.

13
00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.075
I'm in Venice.

14
00:03:23.412 --> 00:03:25.455
With your parole officer's approval,
of course.

15
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.916
Well, I like the guy, Stella,
you know that,

16
00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:29.960
but we never really connected.

17
00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:32.963
So I think I've paid my PO his last visit.

18
00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:34.631
What are you into, Dad?

19
00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:37.467
Don't break my heart.
You told me you were through.

20
00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:39.970
After this I am, I swear to you.

21
00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:43.807
Is Charlie there?

22
00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:45.809
I'm on a cell phone, darling.

23
00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:48.603
I'll call you tomorrow from a land line.

24
00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:51.940
I love you. Go back to sleep. Bye.

25
00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:53.984
Dad?

26
00:03:58.405 --> 00:03:59.990
I love you, too.

27
00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:07.914
I sent it.

28
00:04:07.998 --> 00:04:10.438
You're supposed to do your shopping
after we pull off the job.

29
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.170
- I feel so optimistic.
- Oh?

30
00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:16.673
- How do you feel?
- I'm fine.

31
00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:17.799
Fine?

32
00:04:17.883 --> 00:04:19.634
You know what "Fine" stands for,
don't you?

33
00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:21.303
Yeah, unfortunately.

34
00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:22.429
"Freaked out."

35
00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:23.847
- "Insecure."
- "Neurotic."

36
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.640
- And "Emotional."
- Good.

37
00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:27.893
See those columns behind you?

38
00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:30.562
What about them?

39
00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:34.357
That's where they used to string up
thieves who felt "Fine."

40
00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:36.193
Well, after you.

41
00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:45.368
For after the haul.

42
00:04:46.203 --> 00:04:47.996
Hope I get to fire it up.

43
00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:50.791
- Still no word from the garbage men?
- No.

44
00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.083
If they're a no-show,

45
00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:53.561
it's three months of prep down the tubes

46
00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.104
and I dragged you out of retirement
for nothing.

47
00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.671
Oh, this is fun. I like this.

48
00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:59.716
You taking over the reins,
and all the worries.

49
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.052
Me, loosey-goosey,
just along for the ride.

50
00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:03.735
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself, John.

51
00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:05.884
Just remember, a police boat
can get from the station

52
00:05:05.931 --> 00:05:06.973
to our position in seven.

53
00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:08.993
That means you got four minutes
to work your magic.

54
00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:12.312
No, you told me ten,
and you said I would have five.

55
00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:13.939
When?

56
00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:19.945
Do not be messing with me
right now, okay? I will kick your ass.

57
00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:21.071
Oh, yeah?

58
00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.632
Come on, take your best shot. Come on.

59
00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:23.698
What?

60
00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:36.711
Come on. Let's go.

61
00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.256
- What is it this time?
- Da Vinci.

62
00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.092
- Architect. Engineer. Painter.
- Yeah, fascinating.

63
00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:43.885
Hey, look. Check this out.

64
00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:47.722
"Learn the language of poetry,
art, romance, sex."

65
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.101
Unlike you, my friend,
I don't need a guidebook.

66
00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:54.062
- Can we go? Please?
- Right, guvnor.

67
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:57.899
Come along, make yourself useful.
Untie that line.

68
00:05:57.983 --> 00:05:59.484
- Today.
- Yeah.

69
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:02.362
Yeah, Gilligan, if you don't mind.

70
00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:41.526
- Are we set?
- Yeah.

71
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:42.837
I've enhanced the viewing matrix

72
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.214
to track both the Cartesian coordinates
and three altitude angles,

73
00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.656
the yaw, pitch and roll, to give us

74
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.034
the exact position and orientation
of our baby.

75
00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:51.328
We're in Italy. Speak English.

76
00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:52.954
Steve, how we looking?

77
00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:56.499
Papa took the boat to work at 8:15,
so the garage is empty.

78
00:06:56.583 --> 00:07:01.421
Mama left with daughter at 8:30
for preschool as usual.

79
00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:04.007
So for the next 45 minutes

80
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.800
we own this place, gentlemen.

81
00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:07.969
Still no word from the garbage men?

82
00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:10.555
Hey, who got you
the beekeepers in Budapest?

83
00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:12.849
They'll be there.
You can trust these guys.

84
00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:15.352
Steve, how many times
do I have to tell you?

85
00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:19.731
I trust everyone.
I just don't trust the devil inside them.

86
00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:09.406
We're in.

87
00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:28.383
Just tell me where to paint.

88
00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:39.394
- Your men are still not in position?
- They will be.

89
00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:41.813
But you don't know that, Steve.
We should abort.

90
00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:45.567
I'm sorry, John,
but I think that's Charlie's call now.

91
00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:52.633
Our baby's being
taken out of here tonight,

92
00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:54.409
and this is our only shot at it.

93
00:08:57.787 --> 00:08:58.872
Charlie?

94
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.624
Keep going?

95
00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:03.668
It's up to you, kid.

96
00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:05.754
It's a go.

97
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.300
Okay, Steve.

98
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.555
From the west wall, measure 14'8".

99
00:09:16.347 --> 00:09:17.348
Got it.

100
00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:20.560
Now measure 8'5" from the north wall.

101
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.438
That's the northwest corner of our baby.

102
00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:26.149
- Got it.
- Well, it's right above you.

103
00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:41.247
Look how they play. Look at them.

104
00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:42.916
They play so bad.

105
00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:47.420
- They are no-good.
- Are you joking? I bet on the game.

106
00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.725
Now, paint.

107
00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:02.560
29" wide...

108
00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:05.438
2'5" deep.

109
00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:08.608
Okay, Left Ear, you're up.

110
00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:12.195
14'4" from that west wall.

111
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.625
This game sucks.

112
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.586
Penalty? Kiss my ass!

113
00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:39.514
Yeah.

114
00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:42.142
- This is it. We are ready.
- Good.

115
00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:43.309
Whenever you want.

116
00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:47.021
The garbage men are in position, John.

117
00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:21.514
Holy cow!

118
00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:23.266
What happened?

119
00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:24.976
I'll go and check what happened.

120
00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:53.129
Go! Now!

121
00:12:06.517 --> 00:12:08.186
I'll go downstairs to see what happened.

122
00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:13.566
It will be a hole as big as a house.

123
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.235
They left.

124
00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:49.310
We are reaching them.

125
00:12:49.394 --> 00:12:51.354
All right, Charlie,
someone just called it in.

126
00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:53.064
The police boat's heading your way.

127
00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:56.359
Seven minutes and counting. Let's go.

128
00:14:16.898 --> 00:14:19.108
We got four minutes
to load and leave. Let's go.

129
00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:32.223
Come on!

130
00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:53.744
Attention. We are searching for a witness.

131
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:32.051
Hey, you guys, come here.

132
00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:37.390
I want to propose a toast.

133
00:17:38.474 --> 00:17:39.600
To us.

134
00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:41.602
- Yeah!
- Right!

135
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.774
And I want to propose a toast
to Charlie

136
00:17:46.857 --> 00:17:50.194
because we just stole
$35 million worth of gold

137
00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:53.906
<i>without even holding a gun
because he planned this down to a.</i>

138
00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:56.576
Nobody else could have done that. Nobody.

139
00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:58.452
- Charlie!
- Charlie!

140
00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:00.913
Thank you.

141
00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:02.582
So, come on, gentlemen.

142
00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:05.293
Shopping lists. Who's doing what?
Spare no dirty details.

143
00:18:05.376 --> 00:18:06.627
Come on, you guys.

144
00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:08.838
Take a lesson from an old man.

145
00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.090
Don't spend it. Invest.

146
00:18:12.341 --> 00:18:13.593
In what?

147
00:18:14.135 --> 00:18:15.386
In gold.

148
00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:20.850
Let's figure out how to
get out of here first, all right?

149
00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:22.643
What are you getting, Rob?

150
00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:25.980
I don't know, there's a lot of things
you can buy with a lot of money.

151
00:18:26.063 --> 00:18:28.482
Now, I'm just thinking about
naked girls in leather seats.

152
00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:30.151
Obviously. See?

153
00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:32.737
I suppose I'd get
the Aston Martin Vanquish.

154
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.238
There's not a lot a girl won't do

155
00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:35.966
on the passenger seat
of one of those things.

156
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.658
I'm going to get a NAD T770

157
00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:41.162
digital decoder with the 70-watt amps
and Burr-Brown DACs.

158
00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:43.956
- Yeah.
- It's a big stereo.

159
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.334
Speakers so loud
they blow women's clothes off.

160
00:18:46.417 --> 00:18:48.336
Now you're talking.

161
00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:51.339
35 million dollars, you can't get
more creative than that, man?

162
00:18:51.505 --> 00:18:54.842
I'm going to Andalusia,
south of Spain, right there.

163
00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:56.385
Get me a big house.

164
00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:58.471
Get me a library full of first editions.

165
00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:00.514
Get a room for my shoes.

166
00:19:01.015 --> 00:19:02.516
What about you, Steve?

167
00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.435
I don't know, I haven't decided yet.

168
00:19:04.727 --> 00:19:05.811
You haven't decided yet?

169
00:19:05.936 --> 00:19:08.105
Come on, man.
Is it the mountain air or just...

170
00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:11.025
I liked what you said.
I'll take one of each of yours.

171
00:19:13.027 --> 00:19:16.530
- Well, two of everything for Steve, then.
- Two of those.

172
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:23.454
Loved the toast.

173
00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:25.807
But you could've pulled this off
with your eyes closed.

174
00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:28.292
No, you were incredible.

175
00:19:28.584 --> 00:19:29.794
Just incredible.

176
00:19:29.877 --> 00:19:33.297
You saw the whole picture.
You covered all the angles.

177
00:19:34.048 --> 00:19:35.841
You know, Charlie...

178
00:19:35.966 --> 00:19:38.886
there are two kinds of thieves
in this world...

179
00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.056
the ones who steal
to enrich their lives...

180
00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:45.101
and the ones who steal
to define their lives.

181
00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:47.436
Don't be the latter.

182
00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:51.524
Makes you miss out
on what's really important in this life.

183
00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:54.235
What are you talking about, John?

184
00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:55.736
You've been a good father.

185
00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.531
Sending presents
doesn't make you a good father.

186
00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:01.575
I spent half my kid's life in prison.

187
00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:05.621
Don't get to be my age
with nothing but this, Charlie.

188
00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:10.000
Find somebody you want to spend
the rest of your life with...

189
00:20:10.084 --> 00:20:11.836
and hold on to her forever.

190
00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.462
Okay?

191
00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:14.588
Hey.

192
00:20:15.339 --> 00:20:17.174
Let's go. I'm freezing my ass off.

193
00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:18.342
Yeah.

194
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:22.304
Steve's getting cold. You, too?

195
00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:24.348
I'm all right.

196
00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:28.185
I love you, kid. You did really great.

197
00:20:28.602 --> 00:20:30.020
Thanks, John.

198
00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:32.815
Let's go.

199
00:20:58.966 --> 00:21:01.135
You should've seen Rob
behind the wheel of that boat.

200
00:21:01.218 --> 00:21:02.803
He was like Don Johnson.

201
00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:04.472
Oh, yeah, from Brixton.

202
00:21:04.555 --> 00:21:07.308
Yeah, but what do you know
about Brixton, eh?

203
00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:15.691
Look at this idiot,
right in the middle of the road.

204
00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:18.360
Who's that? What's this, what's this?

205
00:21:20.988 --> 00:21:22.406
Who the hell are these guys?

206
00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:28.037
- Hey!
- Take your hands off the wheel.

207
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.288
Steve!

208
00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:34.126
Don't even think about it. Just do it.

209
00:21:35.836 --> 00:21:37.880
Let's go! Let's go!

210
00:21:39.757 --> 00:21:42.635
- No, John.
- Steve, what the hell are you doing?

211
00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:44.720
I made a few plans of my own.

212
00:21:47.431 --> 00:21:50.434
There's nowhere you can go where we
won't find you, Steve, you know that.

213
00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:52.228
I think that's probably right, John.

214
00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:54.063
Go! Go! Go!

215
00:23:37.666 --> 00:23:38.918
Charlie.

216
00:23:41.253 --> 00:23:43.130
We got to go, Charlie.

217
00:25:07.756 --> 00:25:09.425
You always work in the dark?

218
00:25:10.217 --> 00:25:12.261
Makes me feel like I'm alone.

219
00:25:15.139 --> 00:25:17.057
Not bad. Not bad, Stella.

220
00:25:17.141 --> 00:25:20.060
- Damn. Hurley couldn't crack that safe.
- Neither could Spears.

221
00:25:20.144 --> 00:25:21.854
Now you know who to call first.

222
00:25:21.937 --> 00:25:25.315
You're expensive, Stella. Those guys
cut us a break on subpoena jobs,

223
00:25:25.399 --> 00:25:27.484
good will, community service.

224
00:25:27.568 --> 00:25:30.738
I do it for the money, Paul.
I'll be sending you a bill.

225
00:25:31.488 --> 00:25:34.616
- Don't you want to see what's inside?
- I never look inside.

226
00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:35.868
Have a good day.

227
00:25:35.951 --> 00:25:37.536
- Hey, George.
- Hi, Stella.

228
00:26:12.613 --> 00:26:15.365
- How long to crack it?
- Four minutes and 43 seconds.

229
00:26:15.449 --> 00:26:16.992
Oh! You're the man.

230
00:26:17.076 --> 00:26:19.369
- What's on the lineup?
- Todd Milliken called.

231
00:26:19.453 --> 00:26:22.748
He has a prototype combination lock
he wants you to test out.

232
00:26:22.831 --> 00:26:26.376
He says he added
two false contact points on the tumbler.

233
00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:29.546
I'll pretend to be stumped for a couple
of seconds, give him a thrill.

234
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:32.549
And there's a Charlie Croker
in your office.

235
00:26:33.175 --> 00:26:35.385
He says you two know each other.

236
00:26:38.847 --> 00:26:40.390
Charlie Croker.

237
00:26:41.141 --> 00:26:42.559
Hey, Stella.

238
00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:48.524
Didn't I tell you
I never want to see you again?

239
00:26:49.233 --> 00:26:51.443
I think it was when you told me
how my father died

240
00:26:51.527 --> 00:26:54.905
right in front of your eyes,
after you pulled him in for one last job.

241
00:26:59.743 --> 00:27:01.578
We found him, Stella.

242
00:27:01.787 --> 00:27:03.539
He's in Los Angeles.

243
00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:07.167
The gold bricks he stole from us had
a Balinese dancer stamped on them.

244
00:27:07.251 --> 00:27:09.491
I just got word from a contact of mine
called Skinny Pete

245
00:27:09.545 --> 00:27:11.689
that a gold dealer out in LA
has been buying those bricks.

246
00:27:11.713 --> 00:27:12.756
Yeah?

247
00:27:13.465 --> 00:27:14.758
Well, how do you know it's him?

248
00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:18.053
Skinny Pete sent me this.

249
00:27:18.345 --> 00:27:21.056
Steve changed his last name to Frezelli.

250
00:27:26.603 --> 00:27:28.272
Why are you telling me all of this?

251
00:27:28.355 --> 00:27:30.983
Been checking out the databases
of some high-end safe companies.

252
00:27:31.066 --> 00:27:32.776
Found out Steve had a Worthington 1000

253
00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.027
delivered to his home office.

254
00:27:34.111 --> 00:27:35.571
You don't install a Worthington 1000

255
00:27:35.654 --> 00:27:37.465
unless you've got something
really big to guard.

256
00:27:37.489 --> 00:27:38.574
No, you don't.

257
00:27:38.657 --> 00:27:41.243
The problem now is no one in my crew
can handle Steve's safe.

258
00:27:41.326 --> 00:27:42.744
I need somebody I can trust.

259
00:27:42.828 --> 00:27:45.789
Look, I'm a professional safe
and vault technician. I'm not a thief.

260
00:27:45.873 --> 00:27:47.749
Hey, it's not about the gold,
Stella, okay?

261
00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:50.419
John was like a father to me, too.

262
00:27:54.298 --> 00:27:55.507
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

263
00:27:55.591 --> 00:27:58.093
I just can't move on
until I've set things right.

264
00:28:04.766 --> 00:28:06.268
I've moved on.

265
00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:12.042
Come on, Charlie.

266
00:29:12.292 --> 00:29:13.502
Come on.

267
00:29:19.883 --> 00:29:20.968
Hello.

268
00:29:21.051 --> 00:29:24.179
I want to see the look on that man's face
when his gold is gone.

269
00:29:24.471 --> 00:29:27.307
He took my father from me.
I'm taking this.

270
00:29:32.187 --> 00:29:33.188
She's in.

271
00:29:33.272 --> 00:29:35.312
- And that's a good thing?
- It's a very good thing.

272
00:29:35.357 --> 00:29:37.585
She can crack the Worthington 1000
without even flinching.

273
00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:40.320
I'm not sure having a civilian
on the crew's a good idea, Charlie.

274
00:29:40.404 --> 00:29:42.656
She's got the skill
and she's got the motivation.

275
00:29:42.739 --> 00:29:43.949
Exactly.

276
00:29:44.241 --> 00:29:45.575
She's emotional.

277
00:29:45.659 --> 00:29:47.619
You know what happens
when emotion gets into it.

278
00:29:47.703 --> 00:29:49.288
Look, don't kid yourself, all right?

279
00:29:49.371 --> 00:29:50.914
We're all emotional on this one.

280
00:29:50.998 --> 00:29:52.249
Let's go.

281
00:29:53.875 --> 00:29:56.211
- Are you ready?
- Of course I am.

282
00:29:58.213 --> 00:29:59.840
You're not ready.

283
00:30:23.989 --> 00:30:25.490
That was quick.

284
00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:28.201
Where are they?

285
00:30:28.285 --> 00:30:31.913
We're a little early. I didn't expect
us to get here quite that fast.

286
00:30:33.123 --> 00:30:34.875
There. That's Lyle.

287
00:30:35.208 --> 00:30:37.210
He's my computer genius.

288
00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:44.134
You know, he's who really
invented Napster.

289
00:30:44.468 --> 00:30:45.886
At least that's how Lyle tells it.

290
00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:51.266
He said Shawn Fanning was his roommate
in college and stole his idea.

291
00:31:02.903 --> 00:31:06.239
I think it's his first time
riding that bike, though.

292
00:31:08.658 --> 00:31:09.743
Hey.

293
00:31:14.039 --> 00:31:15.290
You okay?

294
00:31:16.666 --> 00:31:17.751
Yeah.

295
00:31:19.211 --> 00:31:20.796
That's Left Ear.

296
00:31:21.588 --> 00:31:23.256
Demolition and explosives.

297
00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:24.484
When he was ten,
he put one too many

298
00:31:24.508 --> 00:31:25.967
M80s in the toilet bowl.

299
00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.262
<i>Whoa!</i>

300
00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:32.182
Damn, that was cool.
How'd you do that?

301
00:31:32.307 --> 00:31:33.308
What?

302
00:31:33.392 --> 00:31:34.726
How'd you do that?

303
00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:35.852
What?

304
00:31:35.977 --> 00:31:38.438
I said, how did you do that?

305
00:31:38.522 --> 00:31:39.606
What?

306
00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:42.275
Lost the hearing in his right ear.

307
00:31:42.359 --> 00:31:44.653
He's been blowing stuff up ever since.

308
00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:50.283
Handsome Rob, premier wheel man.

309
00:31:50.534 --> 00:31:52.119
Once drove all the way
from Los Angeles

310
00:31:52.202 --> 00:31:55.288
just so he could set the record
for longest freeway chase.

311
00:32:04.005 --> 00:32:06.550
You know, he got 110 love letters
sent to his jail cell

312
00:32:06.633 --> 00:32:08.301
from women who saw him on the news.

313
00:32:19.729 --> 00:32:20.981
And you?

314
00:32:21.189 --> 00:32:23.608
I never heard how you got your start.

315
00:32:23.692 --> 00:32:24.734
Me?

316
00:32:26.069 --> 00:32:28.488
Well, I've been a thief
since I had baby teeth.

317
00:32:28.572 --> 00:32:30.866
Okay, you both know what to do.

318
00:32:31.074 --> 00:32:33.201
Cough it up now.

319
00:32:40.208 --> 00:32:41.501
Watch it, spaz!

320
00:32:42.586 --> 00:32:44.463
Hey, what's your problem, man?

321
00:32:49.426 --> 00:32:51.386
- Hey, Charlie.
- Good to see you, man.

322
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:53.013
- You good?
- Yeah.

323
00:32:53.096 --> 00:32:55.348
- Charlie Hustle.
- Good to see you.

324
00:32:55.432 --> 00:32:57.684
- Hello, Charlie.
- Rob, what's up? Good?

325
00:32:58.226 --> 00:33:00.812
Guys, Stella Bridger.

326
00:33:01.605 --> 00:33:02.647
Hi.

327
00:33:03.106 --> 00:33:05.275
How you doing? Nice to meet you.

328
00:33:05.358 --> 00:33:06.401
Phones?

329
00:33:06.485 --> 00:33:09.005
Yeah, they're all fresh and clean.
I got internal chips in them.

330
00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.823
Please change them twice a day,
or we will get heat on line.

331
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.116
IDs?

332
00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:17.078
"James Hymen!"

333
00:33:17.162 --> 00:33:19.331
Come on, man.
One time, give me a cool name.

334
00:33:19.414 --> 00:33:21.666
A hundred and forty pounds? Try 165.

335
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:23.752
- Try lifting some weights.
- Try lifting up these.

336
00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:25.921
Guys, enough.
Come on, we leave tomorrow, all right?

337
00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:27.005
Let's go.

338
00:33:27.088 --> 00:33:28.298
Hey, Charlie...

339
00:33:29.466 --> 00:33:31.927
Handsome, can you help him
with the bike?

340
00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:34.888
Yeah, help Knievel set up
for his next jump.

341
00:34:04.209 --> 00:34:06.878
Man, out of all of the places
for a thief to hide

342
00:34:06.962 --> 00:34:08.672
this joker picked Hollywood.

343
00:34:08.755 --> 00:34:10.840
He's a punk, but he ain't stupid.

344
00:34:10.924 --> 00:34:12.384
All right.

345
00:34:12.801 --> 00:34:14.654
We need to figure out a way
to get into Steve's house

346
00:34:14.678 --> 00:34:16.388
and make a video blueprint
of the interior.

347
00:34:16.471 --> 00:34:18.181
I want audio surveillance on his phone.

348
00:34:18.265 --> 00:34:19.933
Oh, yeah, I been wanting
to try something.

349
00:34:20.016 --> 00:34:22.161
I'll crack into the phone company's
remote monitoring system

350
00:34:22.185 --> 00:34:24.330
and fool it into thinking
there's a legal tap on the line.

351
00:34:24.354 --> 00:34:26.916
Just reroute the digital copies
of the calls to our own listening post.

352
00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:29.067
I've been doing it to my ex for years.

353
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:30.235
How long?

354
00:34:30.318 --> 00:34:31.444
No. How long will it take?

355
00:34:31.528 --> 00:34:33.339
Not how long
have you been doing it to your ex.

356
00:34:33.363 --> 00:34:35.907
I'll burn through the night.
I'll have it running by morning.

357
00:34:38.243 --> 00:34:39.286
Sorry I'm late.

358
00:34:39.369 --> 00:34:41.249
We gotta work on getting Steve
out of the house.

359
00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:43.582
Stella, how much time will you need
with the Worthington?

360
00:34:43.665 --> 00:34:46.543
- Five minutes flat.
- Don't be cocky, young lady.

361
00:34:46.626 --> 00:34:49.629
It's not the same as opening
a safe for the police.

362
00:34:49.796 --> 00:34:53.466
Got perspiration on your fingertips,
your heart's pounding in your ears,

363
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:55.385
whole different ballgame.

364
00:34:56.261 --> 00:34:59.014
I appreciate your concern. I'll be fine.

365
00:34:59.472 --> 00:35:02.267
Look, just remember,
this is all the easy part, okay?

366
00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:03.950
It's the getaway that can get us caught.

367
00:35:03.977 --> 00:35:06.563
- So what's the sketch?
- We drive to Union Station.

368
00:35:06.646 --> 00:35:08.607
The getaway car goes
right onto the train with us.

369
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:10.570
We need to know exactly
how long it's gonna take

370
00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:12.694
to get from Steve's house
to Union Station.

371
00:35:44.476 --> 00:35:46.227
Oh, great. Carson Security System.

372
00:35:46.311 --> 00:35:47.854
How good is it?

373
00:35:48.313 --> 00:35:49.814
Carson's held an annual contest.

374
00:35:49.898 --> 00:35:52.776
Fifty thousand dollars to anybody
that can bypass the system.

375
00:35:52.859 --> 00:35:55.487
The who's who of ex-cons always show up.

376
00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:58.281
Five years running, no one's been paid.

377
00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:00.825
Okay, party people, here's the status.

378
00:36:00.909 --> 00:36:02.619
It's an anti-scaling fence.

379
00:36:02.702 --> 00:36:04.496
It's hardened, electro-plated steel.

380
00:36:04.579 --> 00:36:07.499
Yeah, I'm gonna have to paint that up
with some nitromin.

381
00:36:07.582 --> 00:36:10.210
- Security on the property?
- Got an armed guard here.

382
00:36:10.293 --> 00:36:12.754
Little rent-a-cop, with a 9mm on his hip.

383
00:36:12.921 --> 00:36:14.214
But that booth,

384
00:36:14.297 --> 00:36:17.467
security booth look prime
for a chemical grenade.

385
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:20.845
Nitromin, chemical grenades,
that stuff's pretty hard to come by.

386
00:36:20.929 --> 00:36:22.597
Yeah, Lyle, it's a bear market.

387
00:36:25.225 --> 00:36:26.351
Shit.

388
00:36:28.228 --> 00:36:29.938
This dude got dogs.

389
00:36:30.188 --> 00:36:33.692
I don't do dogs.
I had a real bad experience, man.

390
00:36:33.775 --> 00:36:38.154
- What happened?
- I had a bad experience.

391
00:36:38.238 --> 00:36:40.073
Damn it. I'm deaf!

392
00:36:55.338 --> 00:36:57.458
"You turn in your badge
and your weapon..." Oh, shoot.

393
00:36:58.717 --> 00:37:01.136
"Turn in your badge and your weapon."

394
00:37:01.886 --> 00:37:03.138
Crush.

395
00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:06.391
"I don't wanna see you anywhere
near this investigation."

396
00:37:07.308 --> 00:37:09.769
"And turn in your badge
and your weapon."

397
00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:12.564
"I don't want to see you anywhere
near this investigation."

398
00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:16.151
Hey! It's a green!

399
00:37:16.234 --> 00:37:18.862
"Turn in your badge and your weapon."

400
00:37:18.945 --> 00:37:19.946
Green!

401
00:37:20.029 --> 00:37:22.824
"I don't want to see you
anywhere near this..." Oh.

402
00:37:22.907 --> 00:37:25.285
"Turn in your badge and your weapon."

403
00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:29.080
Unbelievable.

404
00:37:41.426 --> 00:37:42.886
There he is.

405
00:38:01.946 --> 00:38:03.615
Let's get to work.

406
00:38:07.243 --> 00:38:09.954
It's either bad traffic, peak traffic...

407
00:38:10.789 --> 00:38:12.749
or slit-your-wrist traffic.

408
00:38:13.416 --> 00:38:16.544
You know, five people died from smoking,
in between traffic lights today.

409
00:38:16.795 --> 00:38:18.797
Well, you know, they do have
the Metro Rail, Rob.

410
00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.131
We could always use that.

411
00:38:20.215 --> 00:38:23.968
That'd be ideal for carrying
a ton of gold, wouldn't it, genius?

412
00:38:24.093 --> 00:38:25.887
What's your guesstimate?

413
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:27.722
The last 20 times
I've done the journey,

414
00:38:27.806 --> 00:38:31.226
you got an average of 32 minutes
and a top time of 50.

415
00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:34.687
But, if we had green lights all the way,
we can do it in 14 minutes.

416
00:38:34.813 --> 00:38:36.981
Wait, you couldn't get through traffic?

417
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.615
We could do anything
with green lights all the way.

418
00:38:47.116 --> 00:38:48.159
Lyle?

419
00:38:48.743 --> 00:38:49.828
Lyle?

420
00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.164
I'll see what I can do.

421
00:38:57.502 --> 00:38:59.295
You're right on time.

422
00:39:04.676 --> 00:39:06.427
All these poor bastards out there,

423
00:39:06.511 --> 00:39:10.348
putting their life savings in banks
and S&Ls and mutual funds.

424
00:39:10.473 --> 00:39:12.517
What do they think,
when the collapse comes

425
00:39:12.642 --> 00:39:14.310
they can depend on the government?

426
00:39:14.352 --> 00:39:15.645
I don't think so.

427
00:39:15.728 --> 00:39:18.106
- Are you taping me?
- Of course not.

428
00:39:18.606 --> 00:39:21.693
I never tape you.
Come, look. See for yourself.

429
00:39:23.945 --> 00:39:26.114
Governments are nothing more than puppets

430
00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:31.035
and strings in a world where NAFTA
can overrule the Supreme Court.

431
00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:36.124
Like my cousin Mashkov always says,
"This is our only refuge, baby.

432
00:39:36.541 --> 00:39:37.834
Gold."

433
00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:48.636
Every time I look at these engravings...

434
00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.638
She's so beautiful.

435
00:39:51.389 --> 00:39:54.434
- Where did you say you got these?
- Didn't.

436
00:40:00.857 --> 00:40:03.067
A little walking around money.

437
00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:14.495
I guess I'm not walking
as far as I thought.

438
00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:17.165
I'm sorry. I can only buy two bricks
from you today.

439
00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:18.416
That wasn't the agreement.

440
00:40:18.499 --> 00:40:20.835
What can I say? I'm just middleman.

441
00:40:20.919 --> 00:40:23.004
I'll buy the other two from you
on Wednesday.

442
00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:24.547
Don't waste my time, Yevhen.

443
00:40:35.767 --> 00:40:39.729
So, what does a man with
$35 million worth of gold do at night?

444
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:44.567
He watches his big-ass TV.

445
00:40:47.278 --> 00:40:48.780
That's our in.

446
00:41:12.804 --> 00:41:14.472
- Stella.
- Jesus!

447
00:41:15.264 --> 00:41:16.474
Charlie!

448
00:41:16.891 --> 00:41:20.186
- How did you get in here?
- Well, I knocked, but you didn't answer.

449
00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:23.481
- What, so you just let yourself in?
- I was just making sure you were okay.

450
00:41:23.606 --> 00:41:25.483
I apologize. I just...

451
00:41:25.733 --> 00:41:27.110
Don't look.

452
00:41:32.115 --> 00:41:33.157
Okay.

453
00:41:37.328 --> 00:41:38.830
You got a lot of stuff here.

454
00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:42.333
You know, your dad was old school.
Did the whole thing by touch.

455
00:41:42.458 --> 00:41:45.169
That worked for him. This works for me.

456
00:41:45.461 --> 00:41:48.006
Technology guarantees
speed and accuracy, you know.

457
00:41:48.131 --> 00:41:51.300
Yeah, but there's no guarantees
in this business, Stella.

458
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:54.262
Why the headphones?

459
00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:56.139
Just training myself.

460
00:41:56.347 --> 00:41:59.100
Ambient noises, you know, just in case.

461
00:42:01.978 --> 00:42:03.938
What do you want, Charlie?

462
00:42:04.981 --> 00:42:08.192
We're gonna knock out Steve's cable,
and we need to send in a repairman.

463
00:42:08.317 --> 00:42:10.278
To get your video blueprint
of the interior.

464
00:42:10.695 --> 00:42:11.821
Yep.

465
00:42:12.113 --> 00:42:14.198
Only problem is
Steve thinks we're all dead.

466
00:42:17.035 --> 00:42:18.369
Except me.

467
00:42:21.998 --> 00:42:23.374
I'll do it, Charlie.

468
00:42:23.499 --> 00:42:26.169
I'm in, all the way, whatever it takes.

469
00:42:28.212 --> 00:42:30.381
All right. I'll set it up.

470
00:42:30.506 --> 00:42:31.549
Okay.

471
00:42:32.467 --> 00:42:35.136
You maybe want to get a drink
downstairs with me

472
00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:37.388
before I go back to my room?

473
00:42:38.973 --> 00:42:41.684
I should finish this stuff up, you know?

474
00:42:42.477 --> 00:42:45.063
- Just get it all done tonight.
- Yeah.

475
00:42:46.064 --> 00:42:48.399
- Sorry I scared you.
- It's okay.

476
00:42:49.192 --> 00:42:50.568
Good night.

477
00:42:51.903 --> 00:42:52.987
Bye.

478
00:42:54.363 --> 00:42:56.407
And then he's just the media darling.

479
00:42:56.532 --> 00:42:58.092
He's on the cover of all the magazines.

480
00:42:58.159 --> 00:43:00.411
I should've been on the cover
of Wired magazine.

481
00:43:00.536 --> 00:43:01.996
You know what he said? He said he,

482
00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.248
he named it Napster
because it was his nickname,

483
00:43:04.373 --> 00:43:07.168
"cause of the nappy hair
under the hat, but he...

484
00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:10.505
It's 'cause I was napping
when he stole it from me.

485
00:43:10.588 --> 00:43:12.548
He didn't even graduate.

486
00:43:13.674 --> 00:43:16.010
I think it's time to move on, don't you?

487
00:43:16.094 --> 00:43:19.055
They shut him down.
I wish they'd do the same to you.

488
00:43:20.932 --> 00:43:23.434
Yeah, here we go. Cable chick.

489
00:43:35.196 --> 00:43:37.365
Becky. Nice name.

490
00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:39.033
I wonder what she calls the other one.

491
00:43:39.117 --> 00:43:42.954
And it's such a mystery
why you don't have a girlfriend, Lyle.

492
00:43:43.412 --> 00:43:46.290
So, all we need is a service truck
like that one,

493
00:43:46.415 --> 00:43:48.459
a work shirt like hers.

494
00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:52.547
- You think Stella can pull it off?
- I have my doubts.

495
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:55.216
There's no talking to Charlie, though.

496
00:43:56.384 --> 00:43:58.469
You think he's...

497
00:43:58.719 --> 00:44:00.930
mixing business with pleasure?

498
00:44:01.389 --> 00:44:04.809
He should know better.
Only I'm allowed to do that.

499
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:09.147
Right. Where you going?

500
00:44:09.564 --> 00:44:12.066
Get a work shirt and a service truck.

501
00:44:20.741 --> 00:44:22.493
Are you kidding me?

502
00:44:26.497 --> 00:44:28.249
How does he do that?

503
00:44:28.791 --> 00:44:31.085
How do you do that?
What are you saying?

504
00:44:31.169 --> 00:44:32.670
Hey, how are you?

505
00:44:32.753 --> 00:44:34.505
Oh, good. I'm good.

506
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:36.841
Nice to meet you, I'm Handsome Rob.

507
00:44:36.966 --> 00:44:38.259
And you are?

508
00:44:38.342 --> 00:44:41.095
Oh, my name's... My name's Becky,
but it's written on my shirt.

509
00:44:41.179 --> 00:44:44.265
Listen, I'm gonna need your shirt
and your truck.

510
00:44:44.348 --> 00:44:46.434
Perfect. I'll give them both to you.
Would you...

511
00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:48.311
Would you like my virginity as well?

512
00:44:48.394 --> 00:44:49.604
If it's on the menu.

513
00:44:49.854 --> 00:44:52.857
Oh, I'm so witty.
Why don't you take advantage of me?

514
00:44:53.065 --> 00:44:54.817
Yeah, you're not too bright, are you?

515
00:44:55.067 --> 00:44:57.111
No. Perfect.

516
00:46:43.592 --> 00:46:46.387
- What can I do for you, Mr. Frezelli?
- The cable's out.

517
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:48.055
The TV, the modem, everything.

518
00:46:48.139 --> 00:46:51.058
Now get somebody up here
and tell them to hurry up.

519
00:46:56.272 --> 00:46:59.734
- Netcom Cable, how can I help you?
- Hi, I'm up at 3320 East Skyway

520
00:46:59.817 --> 00:47:02.069
and the cable's just gone out,
our modem, everything.

521
00:47:02.153 --> 00:47:03.654
Okay, let's see, sir.

522
00:47:03.738 --> 00:47:05.906
I have a Thursday between 9:00 and 3:00

523
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:08.993
- if that would be good.
- That's going to work. Thank you.

524
00:47:09.076 --> 00:47:11.620
Guard just called the cable company.

525
00:47:13.289 --> 00:47:15.082
What time's the appointment?

526
00:47:15.166 --> 00:47:17.001
Thursday between 9:00 and 3:00.

527
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:27.011
Hello.

528
00:47:27.094 --> 00:47:29.764
Hi, I'm calling from Netcom Cable.
I understand your service is out

529
00:47:29.847 --> 00:47:31.533
and there was an appointment
set up for Thursday.

530
00:47:31.557 --> 00:47:33.351
- Yes.
- Well, we have a technician

531
00:47:33.434 --> 00:47:36.455
working in your area who's finished with
an appointment earlier than expected.

532
00:47:36.479 --> 00:47:38.272
Will somebody be there
for the next hour?

533
00:47:38.356 --> 00:47:39.607
Sure, that'd be great.

534
00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:43.194
All right, our technician will
see you then. Have a nice day.

535
00:47:44.779 --> 00:47:46.530
Here's all the paperwork you need.

536
00:47:46.655 --> 00:47:49.533
Just get him to sign and date
at the bottom.

537
00:47:49.742 --> 00:47:51.827
Let's check out the camera.

538
00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:57.500
Stella, you'll be going patriotic today.

539
00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:03.005
Make sure you walk slowly
or the image will streak.

540
00:48:03.798 --> 00:48:05.549
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

541
00:48:06.467 --> 00:48:09.720
Sorry. Couldn't pin the corsage
on my prom date, either.

542
00:48:09.845 --> 00:48:12.890
- What, you had a prom date?
- It was his cousin.

543
00:48:13.557 --> 00:48:16.102
There's cable lines in the kitchen,
living room, bedroom

544
00:48:16.227 --> 00:48:19.063
and a cable modem
on the computer in the office.

545
00:48:19.146 --> 00:48:21.899
You need to locate the safe in the office.

546
00:48:22.817 --> 00:48:23.901
Okay.

547
00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:26.671
I just want you to know
I think you're very brave going in there.

548
00:48:26.695 --> 00:48:28.322
I know it won't be easy.

549
00:48:28.406 --> 00:48:29.573
I second that.

550
00:48:31.909 --> 00:48:33.744
It's gonna be fine.

551
00:48:35.371 --> 00:48:36.497
What?

552
00:48:36.831 --> 00:48:38.499
You know what "Fine" stands for?

553
00:48:38.582 --> 00:48:40.000
"Freaked out, insecure,

554
00:48:40.084 --> 00:48:42.253
- "neurotic and emotional."
- "Neurotic and emotional."

555
00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:49.718
- You'll be great.
- Yeah.

556
00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:04.733
Good morning. Can I see some ID?

557
00:49:14.201 --> 00:49:17.121
- Thanks for coming so soon.
- Hey, that's part of the job.

558
00:49:17.246 --> 00:49:18.581
All right.

559
00:49:49.904 --> 00:49:51.822
Aston Martin Vanquish.

560
00:49:52.239 --> 00:49:54.783
Looks like that bastard took my car.

561
00:49:58.287 --> 00:50:00.289
Nasty-ass dogs.

562
00:50:01.332 --> 00:50:02.458
Hey!

563
00:50:03.292 --> 00:50:04.335
Hey!

564
00:50:05.503 --> 00:50:06.545
Cease.

565
00:50:10.299 --> 00:50:12.009
Relax. Jesus Christ!

566
00:50:13.469 --> 00:50:15.971
Come on, they won't bother you now.

567
00:50:17.765 --> 00:50:18.849
Come on.

568
00:50:20.976 --> 00:50:22.144
House.

569
00:50:22.353 --> 00:50:24.146
Go on, get out of here.

570
00:50:29.443 --> 00:50:32.780
It's okay, I'm used to running into
all sorts of animals on my job.

571
00:50:36.367 --> 00:50:37.868
Steve Frezelli.

572
00:50:39.662 --> 00:50:40.829
Becky.

573
00:50:44.458 --> 00:50:48.295
- You wanna show me that problem?
- Yeah, of course. This way.

574
00:50:50.381 --> 00:50:52.466
- You have a really nice house.
- Yeah.

575
00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:55.886
1922. All the original tiles.

576
00:50:56.679 --> 00:51:00.891
Every stone in that courtyard
hauled from some monastery in Seville.

577
00:51:01.934 --> 00:51:02.935
What a tactic.

578
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:06.355
Monastery. Monastery for punk-ass creeps.

579
00:51:06.855 --> 00:51:08.399
You don't seem impressed.

580
00:51:08.857 --> 00:51:11.235
No, it's just that I don't think
lugging a bunch of rocks

581
00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:14.154
from one place to another
is quite that interesting, you know.

582
00:51:14.238 --> 00:51:16.323
It doesn't quite do it for me.

583
00:51:16.532 --> 00:51:18.117
What does do it for you?

584
00:51:20.494 --> 00:51:21.537
TVs.

585
00:51:22.204 --> 00:51:23.998
I have a monster TV.

586
00:51:24.873 --> 00:51:26.166
Not working right now, but...

587
00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:29.336
But, you know, I should probably
check out the cable modem, you know.

588
00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:31.755
Yeah? Yeah, right. Over here.

589
00:51:34.925 --> 00:51:38.345
I paid $30,000 to some punk kid
to put this system in.

590
00:51:38.429 --> 00:51:39.847
One day, it just goes out.

591
00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:42.391
Ought to have him strung up.

592
00:51:45.728 --> 00:51:46.895
Here we go.

593
00:51:46.979 --> 00:51:48.522
There's our baby.

594
00:51:50.566 --> 00:51:52.568
- We got him.
- Got any wiring coming through here?

595
00:51:52.651 --> 00:51:54.945
There's no wiring in here.

596
00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:59.283
- Just right here?
- Yeah.

597
00:51:59.366 --> 00:52:00.534
No explanation, just...

598
00:52:00.618 --> 00:52:03.621
Look at that, that's my...
That's my NAD T770.

599
00:52:03.912 --> 00:52:05.205
That's my stereo.

600
00:52:05.289 --> 00:52:06.457
I bet most of your customers

601
00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:09.102
are pretty surprised when they go
to open the door for the cable man

602
00:52:09.126 --> 00:52:11.795
- and find you standing there.
- Oh, yeah.

603
00:52:12.463 --> 00:52:13.797
He's hitting on her.

604
00:52:14.089 --> 00:52:17.217
There's no problem here.
I should maybe just check the TVs.

605
00:52:18.886 --> 00:52:19.970
Okay.

606
00:52:22.723 --> 00:52:24.558
You know what? End this shit right now.

607
00:52:24.642 --> 00:52:26.769
I'll blow this shit
right off the mountain right now.

608
00:52:26.852 --> 00:52:28.270
No. Hey.

609
00:52:33.817 --> 00:52:37.154
- I see you got the AVM processor.
- Only the best.

610
00:52:37.237 --> 00:52:38.739
Check the box.

611
00:52:44.244 --> 00:52:47.665
I'm just gonna reset your system.

612
00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:51.627
Sometimes these things
just get jammed up, you know?

613
00:52:51.752 --> 00:52:53.337
That should do it.

614
00:52:54.171 --> 00:52:55.506
It's fixed?

615
00:52:56.465 --> 00:52:57.841
Turn her on, let's see.

616
00:52:57.925 --> 00:52:58.967
Now.

617
00:53:01.804 --> 00:53:03.097
Japan's Nikkei index...

618
00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:04.306
It's perfect.

619
00:53:09.395 --> 00:53:10.771
Becky, huh?

620
00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:13.315
Have we met before?

621
00:53:16.443 --> 00:53:18.195
No, I don't think so.

622
00:53:18.696 --> 00:53:20.823
If you can just sign there.

623
00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:23.617
So, if I was to ask you out to dinner...

624
00:53:23.701 --> 00:53:26.787
would I be the first one
of your customers to ever do that?

625
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:29.289
What, you asked your
last cable repair guy out for a date?

626
00:53:29.373 --> 00:53:32.626
No, but the last one was, like, 300
pounds, had a handlebar mustache.

627
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:34.294
You know, not really my type.

628
00:53:34.378 --> 00:53:35.963
I don't think it's a good idea.

629
00:53:36.046 --> 00:53:38.215
What, is that, like,
some cable company rule?

630
00:53:38.298 --> 00:53:40.634
No, actually, it's just my rule.

631
00:53:41.468 --> 00:53:45.472
I don't go out with strange men.
I just met you five minutes ago.

632
00:53:46.181 --> 00:53:48.475
So, I guess I have to, like,
sabotage my cable, you know,

633
00:53:48.559 --> 00:53:51.437
till we get to know each other
well enough.

634
00:53:53.355 --> 00:53:54.898
Have a nice day.

635
00:53:55.399 --> 00:53:57.484
Come on, I'll be a perfect gentleman,
I promise.

636
00:53:57.568 --> 00:53:59.248
I won't even ask you
for your phone number.

637
00:53:59.361 --> 00:54:02.531
I'll just... I'll meet you.
Anywhere you want to go.

638
00:54:03.449 --> 00:54:05.576
Come on, break your rule. Once.

639
00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:09.872
It's just dinner.

640
00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:16.712
Is that a yes?

641
00:54:27.765 --> 00:54:29.224
Are you okay?

642
00:54:30.559 --> 00:54:31.727
Yeah.

643
00:54:32.936 --> 00:54:34.605
He touched my hand.

644
00:54:37.191 --> 00:54:38.776
He came on to me.

645
00:54:42.905 --> 00:54:44.364
Hey, at least I...

646
00:54:44.448 --> 00:54:47.284
I created a window of opportunity, right?

647
00:54:49.536 --> 00:54:51.705
When he goes out Friday night, we go in.

648
00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.725
By the time he realizes
you've stood him up,

649
00:54:53.749 --> 00:54:55.793
we'll be long gone with that gold.

650
00:54:55.918 --> 00:54:56.960
Yeah.

651
00:54:59.379 --> 00:55:01.548
Make sure you shuffle them cards
this time, Left.

652
00:55:01.882 --> 00:55:03.217
Hey, Lyle...

653
00:55:03.425 --> 00:55:05.803
what's the distance
between the front door and the vault?

654
00:55:05.928 --> 00:55:09.473
- You're dealing while my back's turned.
- You've got that loser's paranoia.

655
00:55:09.556 --> 00:55:10.641
Lyle!

656
00:55:10.808 --> 00:55:13.352
He only answers
to "The Napster" now, Charlie.

657
00:55:13.435 --> 00:55:15.604
No. I'm not calling you The Napster.

658
00:55:15.687 --> 00:55:17.481
Why not? You call him Left Ear.

659
00:55:17.564 --> 00:55:18.649
Well, I am.

660
00:55:18.732 --> 00:55:20.067
And him, Handsome Rob.

661
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:22.820
Well, that's because
he is Handsome Rob.

662
00:55:22.945 --> 00:55:24.571
Well, you can call me The Napster.

663
00:55:24.655 --> 00:55:27.908
Come on, they were at the same college
at the same time.

664
00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:29.243
Why are you encouraging this?

665
00:55:29.326 --> 00:55:31.286
It is a verifiable fact.

666
00:55:31.411 --> 00:55:34.414
He was my roommate, he stole my ideas.

667
00:55:34.623 --> 00:55:36.250
I am The Napster.

668
00:55:36.834 --> 00:55:38.794
All right. All right.

669
00:55:39.461 --> 00:55:43.590
What is the distance between
the front door and the vault, Napster?

670
00:55:45.425 --> 00:55:47.511
It's farther than you want to carry it.

671
00:55:48.428 --> 00:55:51.849
Yeah, but, so, how do we get the gold
from the vault to the getaway car?

672
00:55:51.974 --> 00:55:54.476
How wide is the hallway, Napster?

673
00:55:59.773 --> 00:56:01.024
Six feet.

674
00:56:18.709 --> 00:56:20.794
Okay, you got your gold.

675
00:57:20.312 --> 00:57:22.898
Well, we need more cars
to handle the weight.

676
00:57:23.357 --> 00:57:26.443
Looks like I'm gonna need some help
with the custom work, too.

677
00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:28.111
I know a man for the job.

678
00:57:28.278 --> 00:57:30.530
So I modified the camera
to include the LIDAR technology

679
00:57:30.614 --> 00:57:33.951
SO we can create
really hi-res digital maps.

680
00:57:34.076 --> 00:57:36.536
- Who's that?
- Rob's mechanic friend.

681
00:57:41.541 --> 00:57:43.460
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey.

682
00:57:43.585 --> 00:57:46.296
- Charlie, this is Wrench.
- Hey, what's up, man?

683
00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:49.967
Rob tells me you got real talent.
We need some bodywork done.

684
00:57:51.134 --> 00:57:53.637
We need to pack up to
2,700 pounds of cargo in these Minis

685
00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:55.222
with enough suspension and horsepower

686
00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:57.391
to outrun anything chasing us.

687
00:57:57.474 --> 00:58:00.435
- 2,700 pounds of what?
- Of whatever.

688
00:58:03.897 --> 00:58:05.983
So, what do I get
out of this mystery deal, man?

689
00:58:06.066 --> 00:58:07.275
Ten thousand.

690
00:58:09.319 --> 00:58:10.654
All right.

691
00:58:37.097 --> 00:58:38.724
Hey.

692
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:41.810
We didn't get a chance to meet yet.

693
00:58:41.893 --> 00:58:43.061
Wrench.

694
00:58:44.062 --> 00:58:47.274
- Ham and cheese.
- Oh, that's cold.

695
00:58:47.858 --> 00:58:49.526
Damn, that's cold.

696
00:59:35.739 --> 00:59:38.909
You want all greens?
'Cause you got them.

697
00:59:38.992 --> 00:59:40.327
What you got?

698
00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:42.746
<i>Welcome 10 LA'S
Automated Traffic Surveillance</i>

699
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:44.664
and Control Operations Center.

700
00:59:44.748 --> 00:59:46.666
See, they use video feeds
from intersections

701
00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:49.669
and specifically designed algorithms
to predict traffic conditions

702
00:59:49.753 --> 00:59:53.256
and thereby control traffic lights.
So all I did was come up with my own

703
00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:57.219
kick-ass algorithm to sneak in,
and now we own the place.

704
00:59:58.095 --> 01:00:01.098
- You want to do a dry run?
- I thought you'd never ask.

705
01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:04.476
See, red light? Green light.

706
01:00:10.065 --> 01:00:11.191
- Danielson?
- Yeah.

707
01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:12.692
What's up with Grid 347

708
01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:14.069
Let's check it out.

709
01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:15.946
Hey.

710
01:00:16.071 --> 01:00:17.531
Oh, oops, did I...

711
01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:20.200
Oops, wow. But it's awesome.
Is that not awesome?

712
01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:22.702
- Can you change it back now?
- Yeah.

713
01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:29.626
Lights are working fine.

714
01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:31.086
It's just an accident.

715
01:00:32.838 --> 01:00:34.214
That's good.

716
01:00:35.882 --> 01:00:38.718
- What are those?
- Unnecessary engine parts.

717
01:00:38.844 --> 01:00:42.305
I lost your smog controls,
and 200 pounds of body fat.

718
01:00:42.389 --> 01:00:45.100
You got yourself
a sweet ride now, Charlie.

719
01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:30.312
You know
what I'm thinking about right now?

720
01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.480
The look on Steve's face.

721
01:01:43.742 --> 01:01:45.952
- You're early.
- I'm in a hurry.

722
01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.082
Of course you know
that the Florida vote rigging

723
01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:53.710
- was a CIA and mob operation.
- Is that so?

724
01:01:53.793 --> 01:01:56.546
Yeah, which is not so very different
from when your John F. Kennedy

725
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:59.090
won a rigged election
with the help of his father.

726
01:01:59.174 --> 01:02:00.774
You're uncomfortable
that I mentioned it.

727
01:02:00.842 --> 01:02:03.553
No, Yevhen,
I don't like making two trips.

728
01:02:03.637 --> 01:02:05.096
You Americans.

729
01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.932
You love your heroes.

730
01:02:07.098 --> 01:02:08.975
A holiday for Columbus?

731
01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:11.895
He makes the wrong turn

732
01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:14.564
and wipes out
an entire indigenous people.

733
01:02:14.648 --> 01:02:17.776
- And you know what he was looking for?
- I bet you're gonna tell me.

734
01:02:17.859 --> 01:02:20.320
Gold. Supposedly for Queen Isabella

735
01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:22.364
but don't think that the Medicis
back in Italy

736
01:02:22.447 --> 01:02:24.157
didn't want a part of that action.

737
01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:26.326
And what did Italy need gold for?

738
01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:29.579
For the long-distance slave trade
based in Venice.

739
01:02:30.622 --> 01:02:33.208
Venice, that's where these bricks...

740
01:02:39.047 --> 01:02:41.841
- You were saying something?
- Nothing. No.

741
01:02:41.925 --> 01:02:44.761
No, you were really on a roll there.
Don't stop. I'm interested.

742
01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:47.264
Please, I'm confused. My English is...

743
01:02:48.556 --> 01:02:49.641
You understand fine.

744
01:02:49.724 --> 01:02:51.893
- Now, what do you know about my gold?
- No, I don't...

745
01:02:51.977 --> 01:02:54.312
Don't you even think about lying to me.

746
01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:59.192
Okay, I heard a rumor
about a heist in Venice.

747
01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:02.028
35 million dollars in bricks

748
01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:04.364
with an imprint
of a Balinese dancer on them.

749
01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:06.074
- Who have you told?
- No one.

750
01:03:06.157 --> 01:03:09.119
- Who have you told?
- No one! I swear to God!

751
01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:12.414
You swear to God?

752
01:03:12.706 --> 01:03:15.000
You crazy? I swear to God.

753
01:03:15.083 --> 01:03:16.334
I didn't.

754
01:03:17.085 --> 01:03:18.837
Well, then, I guess I believe you.

755
01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:49.451
Yevhen.

756
01:03:51.911 --> 01:03:53.079
Yevhen.

757
01:04:10.597 --> 01:04:12.557
Let's putt it this time.

758
01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:14.434
Putt, not drive.

759
01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:16.644
Very good.

760
01:04:16.728 --> 01:04:19.939
If you can just get it...
I know you can, I know you can do it.

761
01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:21.107
Much better.

762
01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:22.317
I'm here to see Skinny Pete.

763
01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.443
That was great.

764
01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:26.029
- Yeah, he's over there.
- Thanks, man.

765
01:04:28.782 --> 01:04:30.200
- Don't stare.
- Huh?

766
01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:32.577
Don't stare. He doesn't like it
when people stare at him.

767
01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:34.120
Stare at what?

768
01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:36.289
That was good. That was good.

769
01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:38.833
Try that one.
I know you're gonna get that one.

770
01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:40.919
That was great.

771
01:04:41.002 --> 01:04:43.129
- Skinny Pete.
- Yo, Charlie.

772
01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:45.465
What's up, man? How's it going?

773
01:04:45.924 --> 01:04:48.051
So was I right about
the gold bricks or what?

774
01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:49.844
Oh, I'm not here to talk about that.

775
01:04:49.928 --> 01:04:51.638
We need some supplies.

776
01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:53.807
Baby, go relax.

777
01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.184
- Baby...
- Go relax.

778
01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:03.691
Yo.

779
01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:05.026
Yo.

780
01:05:05.985 --> 01:05:06.986
Supplies.

781
01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:08.571
- What's wrong?
- Huh?

782
01:05:10.365 --> 01:05:13.034
Some, nitromin.

783
01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:15.620
Some...

784
01:05:16.496 --> 01:05:18.498
Some nitromin, primer...

785
01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:19.791
- What's wrong?
- Huh?

786
01:05:19.874 --> 01:05:22.752
- Yo.
- Nothing. I'm cool, I'm great.

787
01:05:22.836 --> 01:05:26.005
- I just need some, a big can of...
- Nitromin, primer,

788
01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:27.507
- detonating cord...
- Right.

789
01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:29.360
Two triple-charger chemical grenades,
and a launcher.

790
01:05:29.384 --> 01:05:32.804
Right, like I had,
you know, told you earlier.

791
01:05:32.887 --> 01:05:34.180
All right.

792
01:05:40.145 --> 01:05:42.063
Cost you about 5 G's.

793
01:05:42.564 --> 01:05:44.065
Done. Call me.

794
01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:46.818
Thanks, man. I'm sorry about that.

795
01:05:46.901 --> 01:05:48.403
All right, man.

796
01:05:48.862 --> 01:05:50.488
- Peace.
- Come on.

797
01:06:08.047 --> 01:06:09.257
Get out.

798
01:06:10.758 --> 01:06:11.926
There.

799
01:06:20.852 --> 01:06:23.146
Vance has something to tell you.

800
01:06:26.274 --> 01:06:27.442
Go on.

801
01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:31.821
A couple weeks back...

802
01:06:33.031 --> 01:06:35.909
I was working counter
of your cousin's shop.

803
01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:40.121
A guy come in asking about gold bricks
with Balinese dancer on them.

804
01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.415
What did you tell him?

805
01:06:43.917 --> 01:06:46.044
I told him that I'd seen the bricks.

806
01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:52.592
I'm sorry.

807
01:06:54.219 --> 01:06:56.346
What did this man look like?

808
01:06:58.056 --> 01:07:00.600
He had long black hair...

809
01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:02.727
big tattoo on his neck.

810
01:07:05.104 --> 01:07:07.857
He must have weighed
at least 400 pounds.

811
01:07:08.316 --> 01:07:09.943
I know that guy.

812
01:07:38.179 --> 01:07:39.722
Baby, go relax.

813
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:52.485
Do you know who I am?

814
01:07:53.236 --> 01:07:54.821
You're Mashkov.

815
01:07:55.613 --> 01:07:56.990
That's right.

816
01:07:57.073 --> 01:08:01.202
You were asking about gold bricks
with a Balinese dancer on them.

817
01:08:02.328 --> 01:08:03.746
Tell me why.

818
01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:14.841
Steve just called to confirm
his 8:00 reservation at the Water Grill.

819
01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:19.137
- Okay, let's go over it one more time.
- Gas the guards, doors open 8:15.

820
01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.930
Safe popped by 8:25.

821
01:08:21.014 --> 01:08:23.391
Loaded by 8:35, out the door by 8:45.

822
01:08:23.474 --> 01:08:24.976
Straight to Union Station.

823
01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:27.288
Only green lights on your route.
The rest of the city's red.

824
01:08:27.312 --> 01:08:29.355
Cops are stuck in the traffic
like everyone else.

825
01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:32.567
Train leaves at 10:00.
Cars have to be on the carrier by 9:30.

826
01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:35.069
Timing's got to be dead on.

827
01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:36.279
Let's get ready.

828
01:08:36.362 --> 01:08:37.822
Let's get it.

829
01:09:08.811 --> 01:09:10.730
Wow, that is a nice car.

830
01:09:11.522 --> 01:09:12.899
Sorry, Rob.

831
01:09:13.066 --> 01:09:14.901
Coast is clear, guys.

832
01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:28.581
This is it, guys. Moment of truth.

833
01:09:29.916 --> 01:09:31.793
What the hell is this?

834
01:09:33.544 --> 01:09:34.587
Shit!

835
01:09:35.213 --> 01:09:37.757
Steve's neighbor's throwing a party.

836
01:09:40.468 --> 01:09:43.429
- Are you here for the Baker party, sir?
- No.

837
01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:48.935
We're not blowing
any gates tonight, guys.

838
01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:50.687
Too many witnesses.

839
01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:51.896
Stella.

840
01:09:52.313 --> 01:09:53.815
I know, I know.

841
01:09:55.983 --> 01:09:57.819
I'm late for my date.

842
01:09:57.944 --> 01:10:00.113
Yeah, and you gotta be charming.

843
01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:02.615
We'll need him to ask you out again.

844
01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:03.825
Sorry.

845
01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:06.035
You need to get out of the street.

846
01:10:10.289 --> 01:10:12.792
I really can't imagine you doing that.

847
01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:14.502
What's that supposed to mean?

848
01:10:14.585 --> 01:10:18.548
Well, you don't really seem like
the adventurous type, you know?

849
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:22.760
Don't let the cable uniform,
you know, throw you.

850
01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:25.179
Well, I wasn't making assumptions.

851
01:10:25.847 --> 01:10:27.724
Well, I've made some assumptions
about you.

852
01:10:27.807 --> 01:10:29.225
Oh, really?

853
01:10:30.768 --> 01:10:31.853
And?

854
01:10:33.646 --> 01:10:36.566
Oh, well, we're just gonna
have to wait and see.

855
01:10:42.697 --> 01:10:44.699
Why wait? Let's get a check.

856
01:10:44.782 --> 01:10:46.701
Let's go back to my place.
No assumptions...

857
01:10:46.784 --> 01:10:48.202
Not tonight.

858
01:10:48.411 --> 01:10:50.538
It's late. I should go home.

859
01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:53.124
What, do you have
a cable company curfew?

860
01:10:53.207 --> 01:10:56.461
No, but I've made some
bad calls in the past.

861
01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:58.671
Hey.

862
01:10:58.755 --> 01:11:01.174
We should take this
maybe a little slow, you know?

863
01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:03.718
This lovely dinner,
sparkling conversation,

864
01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:06.220
- you still don't trust me?
- Oh, no.

865
01:11:06.888 --> 01:11:08.556
I trust everyone.

866
01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:11.726
It's the devil inside them I don't trust.

867
01:11:16.355 --> 01:11:18.357
That's an interesting saying.

868
01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:21.194
It's charming. Where'd you pick that up?

869
01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:23.237
- Can't remember.
- Really?

870
01:11:23.654 --> 01:11:26.240
I knew a guy who said it
exactly like that.

871
01:11:26.324 --> 01:11:27.825
- Really?
- Yeah.

872
01:11:28.409 --> 01:11:30.244
He's the only person
I've ever heard say that.

873
01:11:30.328 --> 01:11:33.581
He said it all the time.
His name was John Bridger.

874
01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:36.751
You're hurting my wrist.

875
01:11:36.834 --> 01:11:39.462
He had a daughter
and she was about your age.

876
01:11:43.758 --> 01:11:45.134
Let go of my wrist.

877
01:11:45.384 --> 01:11:47.929
I knew there was something
familiar about you.

878
01:11:48.012 --> 01:11:50.139
You're exactly like your old man,
you know that?

879
01:11:50.223 --> 01:11:52.892
I liked him, too, right from the start.

880
01:11:53.017 --> 01:11:56.187
I liked him right up until
the minute I shot him.

881
01:11:57.605 --> 01:11:59.607
Who are you working with?

882
01:12:05.112 --> 01:12:06.614
She's with us.

883
01:12:18.084 --> 01:12:19.544
Gang's all here.

884
01:12:19.627 --> 01:12:22.630
You know the only thing worse
than a thief, Bendel?

885
01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:24.423
A coward.

886
01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:27.927
Then you should have seen the way
your daddy begged for his life.

887
01:12:30.471 --> 01:12:33.099
- It's not worth it.
- Put a leash on your cat.

888
01:12:38.479 --> 01:12:40.189
- Hi, Steve.
- Charlie.

889
01:12:42.817 --> 01:12:45.486
Not bad, Charlie. Really, not bad.

890
01:12:45.653 --> 01:12:47.572
You have no idea
how hard it is for me

891
01:12:47.655 --> 01:12:50.491
not to reach across this table
and Kill you with my bare hands.

892
01:12:50.575 --> 01:12:52.994
You know better than that, Charlie.

893
01:12:53.077 --> 01:12:54.829
Can't let emotion into these things.

894
01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:56.247
Tell me it wasn't about emotion

895
01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:58.050
when you shot John
and left us all for dead.

896
01:12:58.124 --> 01:13:00.001
That wasn't about emotion.

897
01:13:00.084 --> 01:13:01.836
It was about a lot of gold,
and I wanted it.

898
01:13:01.919 --> 01:13:03.963
Anything you think you deserved,
you didn't.

899
01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:06.340
Hey, don't talk about
right and wrong with me, man,

900
01:13:06.424 --> 01:13:08.175
"cause I just don't give a shit.

901
01:13:08.259 --> 01:13:09.343
Okay?

902
01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:11.971
You've got your cards, I got my cards,

903
01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:14.599
we made our play,
and I came out on top, okay?

904
01:13:14.682 --> 01:13:17.018
Now if you want to start
the game up again...

905
01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:18.853
that's fine with me.

906
01:13:19.562 --> 01:13:22.481
What... I mean,
what is your play here, really?

907
01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:25.401
I mean, come on, what do you think?

908
01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:28.321
You'll try to take out my guards, right?

909
01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:30.865
I have five of them
that you don't know about.

910
01:13:31.449 --> 01:13:33.200
You'll try to have Lyle hack the system

911
01:13:33.284 --> 01:13:34.994
but I'll change it again
tomorrow morning.

912
01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:37.371
And what was your final move?

913
01:13:37.455 --> 01:13:39.707
I mean, you were gonna have
Bridger's daughter come in

914
01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:41.751
and try to crack my safe?

915
01:13:42.543 --> 01:13:44.545
I mean, that's very poetic and all

916
01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:46.714
but I just don't see it.

917
01:13:46.797 --> 01:13:48.549
I don't think she'll get anywhere near it.

918
01:13:48.633 --> 01:13:51.802
Same old Steve, huh?
Always thinking defensively.

919
01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:54.096
That's why you're always number two.

920
01:13:54.597 --> 01:13:57.808
- How do you figure that?
- You've got no imagination.

921
01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.037
Couldn't even decide what to do
with all that money.

922
01:14:00.061 --> 01:14:01.701
You had to buy
what everybody else wanted.

923
01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:03.981
Oh, well, try this on
in your imagination, okay?

924
01:14:04.065 --> 01:14:06.067
That gold is already gone.

925
01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:09.070
- That's bullshit, Steve.
- No, really, it's over, Charlie.

926
01:14:09.153 --> 01:14:11.405
I'm trying to move the last two bricks.

927
01:14:11.489 --> 01:14:13.741
You want to come after me
over a couple of lousy bricks?

928
01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:15.910
I mean, really, be my guest.

929
01:14:15.993 --> 01:14:18.245
Really. But you're off to a bad start,
you know?

930
01:14:18.329 --> 01:14:20.515
'Cause you just blew
the best thing you had going for you.

931
01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:22.291
You just blew the element of surprise.

932
01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:27.588
Surprised?

933
01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:33.260
It's over when I say it's over.

934
01:14:36.263 --> 01:14:38.140
Are you all right, sir?

935
01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:11.340
How you doing?

936
01:15:13.384 --> 01:15:14.593
Good.

937
01:15:16.137 --> 01:15:17.638
Considering...

938
01:15:18.973 --> 01:15:20.975
Considering the fact
that I'm doing all of this

939
01:15:21.058 --> 01:15:23.019
for a man I barely knew.

940
01:15:29.817 --> 01:15:33.070
You know what bothered me
all those years, Charlie?

941
01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.781
It was that...

942
01:15:36.782 --> 01:15:40.494
whenever he'd call me to tell me
that he was on some job,

943
01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:43.247
I knew you were right there with him.

944
01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:50.337
You got to know him
a lot better than I did.

945
01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:53.424
Just 'cause he was around me more

946
01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:55.610
doesn't mean he wasn't thinking
about you all the time.

947
01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:57.511
Be nice if it was true.

948
01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.180
It is true.

949
01:15:59.263 --> 01:16:02.683
He always regretted not having been
a good enough father to you, Stella.

950
01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:07.646
How do you know that?

951
01:16:08.022 --> 01:16:09.690
Because he told me.

952
01:16:16.697 --> 01:16:18.908
What did you do to your hand?

953
01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:23.537
I punched Steve.

954
01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.999
And why do you get to punch him
and I don't?

955
01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:31.879
'Cause those hands
are way too valuable.

956
01:16:38.886 --> 01:16:39.970
Hey.

957
01:16:46.018 --> 01:16:47.269
You okay?

958
01:16:56.403 --> 01:16:59.156
There'll be nothing left of that
if you keep rubbing it.

959
01:17:04.829 --> 01:17:07.581
Tell Mr. Frezelli we'll see him at 8:00.

960
01:17:07.665 --> 01:17:08.874
Charlie!

961
01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:13.504
He's flying the coop.

962
01:17:14.088 --> 01:17:15.214
When?

963
01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:18.801
His security guard called
for a private helicopter at 4:00 p.m.

964
01:17:18.884 --> 01:17:21.470
There is an armored car service
coming to his house at 5:00.

965
01:17:21.554 --> 01:17:25.307
There is a cargo plane scheduled
to depart LAX at 8:00 p.m

966
01:17:25.391 --> 01:17:26.892
to Mexico City.

967
01:17:26.976 --> 01:17:29.728
What if he's moving the safe
as a diversion?

968
01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:31.939
We crack it, it's empty,
the gold's somewhere else.

969
01:17:32.022 --> 01:17:34.358
Steve's not about to let that gold
out of his sight.

970
01:17:34.441 --> 01:17:36.378
It's gonna be in that truck
and he's gonna be watching it

971
01:17:36.402 --> 01:17:37.921
every step of the way
from the helicopter.

972
01:17:37.945 --> 01:17:40.048
- So the gold's headed to Mexico.
- Well, who knows where?

973
01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:41.550
They could change
the flight plan in midair.

974
01:17:41.574 --> 01:17:42.616
Slow down, slow down.

975
01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.219
You guys are looking at this
the wrong way.

976
01:17:44.243 --> 01:17:45.411
This is good news for us.

977
01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:47.163
Charlie, what do you mean
"Good news"?

978
01:17:47.246 --> 01:17:48.682
We've been trying to get
to the gold in the safe,

979
01:17:48.706 --> 01:17:50.332
now the safe is coming to us.

980
01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:51.876
We're gonna boost it in transit.

981
01:17:51.959 --> 01:17:54.312
Charlie, he could take
a dozen different routes to the airport.

982
01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:55.838
We have no idea which one.

983
01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:58.340
We can't take out an armored truck
during rush hour.

984
01:17:58.424 --> 01:17:59.884
We're already set up to do it.

985
01:17:59.967 --> 01:18:01.302
Napster...

986
01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:04.346
gridlock every route
except for the one we choose.

987
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:06.807
Force that truck to go exactly
where we want it to go.

988
01:18:06.891 --> 01:18:08.726
Where do we want it to go?

989
01:18:08.809 --> 01:18:11.103
We can't have a shoot-out
with armed guards, we'd lose.

990
01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:13.355
I'm gonna do it like the Italian job.

991
01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:22.072
- Hello.
- Why'd you do it?

992
01:18:22.156 --> 01:18:23.657
- Do what?
- Yevhen.

993
01:18:23.741 --> 01:18:25.242
You didn't have to clip him.

994
01:18:25.326 --> 01:18:27.554
Whoa, what are you talking
about? We didn't clip anybody.

995
01:18:27.578 --> 01:18:31.207
Well, Yevhen's cousin is under
the distinct impression that you did.

996
01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:32.541
Why does he think that?

997
01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:35.878
Because you wanted to know
about the gold with the Balinese dancer.

998
01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:38.380
- You told him that?
- Listen to me, man.

999
01:18:38.464 --> 01:18:42.092
If there's one thing that I know,
is never to mess with Mother Nature,

1000
01:18:42.176 --> 01:18:45.054
mother-in-laws
or mother-freaking Ukrainians.

1001
01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:47.848
Look, I need a favor.

1002
01:19:14.875 --> 01:19:16.752
- Yeah.
- Had a hiccup last night.

1003
01:19:16.835 --> 01:19:19.088
Could use some help.
More hands-on this time.

1004
01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:21.257
- You interested?
- Could be.

1005
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:25.594
But | don't like to be kept in the dark.
If I'm in, I'm in.

1006
01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:28.097
Okay, you're in.

1007
01:19:28.264 --> 01:19:29.682
All right.

1008
01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:36.105
- What do you think, Charlie?
- This'll work. Let's go.

1009
01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:49.952
You're amazing. It's a work of genius.

1010
01:19:59.878 --> 01:20:01.213
You okay?

1011
01:20:01.422 --> 01:20:03.757
- Yeah, just give me a moment.
- Now?

1012
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:07.886
I'm about to insert this pin
into this detonator tube

1013
01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:09.763
and if the brass touches the sides,

1014
01:20:09.847 --> 01:20:12.683
we'll both be the last people we ever see.

1015
01:20:14.685 --> 01:20:16.812
Take all the time you need.

1016
01:20:19.773 --> 01:20:21.817
- Hey, Charlie.
- What?

1017
01:20:24.153 --> 01:20:25.904
I love you, man.

1018
01:20:28.282 --> 01:20:29.867
I love you, too.

1019
01:20:32.703 --> 01:20:33.829
Okay.

1020
01:20:34.204 --> 01:20:35.372
Okay.

1021
01:20:46.633 --> 01:20:47.885
Your attention, please.

1022
01:20:47.968 --> 01:20:51.972
Metrolink train number 774
will arrive in approximately 15 minutes.

1023
01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:10.407
Check positions.

1024
01:21:10.491 --> 01:21:11.658
Napster?

1025
01:21:11.742 --> 01:21:13.160
I'm in position.

1026
01:21:14.745 --> 01:21:15.954
Handsome Rob?

1027
01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:19.583
We're in position.
Everything's quiet here, Charlie.

1028
01:21:22.419 --> 01:21:23.587
Wrench?

1029
01:21:24.588 --> 01:21:25.672
Set.

1030
01:21:42.147 --> 01:21:44.149
Charlie, we got an uninvited visitor.

1031
01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:46.652
There's a motorcycle guard
following the truck.

1032
01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:48.445
We'll deal with it.

1033
01:21:54.993 --> 01:21:56.286
Who are these cats?

1034
01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:59.206
- What's wrong?
- Charlie, you won't believe this.

1035
01:21:59.289 --> 01:22:01.291
He's brought in three armored trucks.

1036
01:22:02.376 --> 01:22:04.795
It's a shell game. Shell game now.

1037
01:22:04.878 --> 01:22:08.048
Well, boss, I can't reroute the truck
if I don't know which truck to reroute.

1038
01:22:08.132 --> 01:22:10.592
Just go with the one
that Steve follows in the helicopter.

1039
01:22:10.676 --> 01:22:13.387
Remember, you said he'd never let
that gold out of his sight.

1040
01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:15.848
Unless he's playing us, and he is.

1041
01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:28.735
Okay, let's go!

1042
01:22:29.069 --> 01:22:30.446
Moving out!

1043
01:22:43.876 --> 01:22:45.252
Here we go.

1044
01:22:45.836 --> 01:22:47.254
They're pulling out.

1045
01:22:48.005 --> 01:22:51.383
Napster, pull up the traffic cameras
you're watching.

1046
01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:53.886
Where's the first camera
the trucks go past?

1047
01:22:58.307 --> 01:23:00.476
Vine and Yucca.
They're all gonna cross there.

1048
01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:02.478
See which one's riding low.

1049
01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:15.741
First one is clear.

1050
01:23:17.201 --> 01:23:19.203
The first two are the same, so...

1051
01:23:23.165 --> 01:23:25.792
Houston, we have our truck.
It is number 128.

1052
01:23:35.469 --> 01:23:37.095
We're moving out.

1053
01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:41.808
Three-kilo-bob to two-fox-mike,
we're heading to the airport.

1054
01:23:56.156 --> 01:23:59.952
Okay, guys, truck 128
has turned right heading west.

1055
01:24:00.911 --> 01:24:02.079
Gridlock time.

1056
01:24:04.331 --> 01:24:07.543
Mr. Scott, pick up
a courtesy telephone, please.

1057
01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:13.549
We've crashed.

1058
01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:16.802
It's not a crash.

1059
01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:19.513
We've got power.

1060
01:24:20.973 --> 01:24:22.558
I can't log in.

1061
01:24:22.683 --> 01:24:26.186
They are about to hit a major detour
and be sent your way.

1062
01:24:33.819 --> 01:24:34.903
Oops.

1063
01:24:39.157 --> 01:24:42.160
You'll never shut down

1064
01:24:42.661 --> 01:24:45.497
the real Napster.

1065
01:24:52.838 --> 01:24:54.558
What's your problem?
The lights are all out!

1066
01:24:54.631 --> 01:24:56.300
What do you want me to do?

1067
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:02.848
Truck 128, what is your progress?

1068
01:25:02.973 --> 01:25:04.349
This is truck 128.

1069
01:25:04.474 --> 01:25:07.477
Traffic's out of control here.
We've got to look for another route.

1070
01:25:09.062 --> 01:25:10.856
Check the police band.

1071
01:25:11.481 --> 01:25:14.026
Okay, I'm opening up a space on Highland.

1072
01:25:18.196 --> 01:25:20.365
- Oh, get us out of here.
- I'm trying.

1073
01:25:26.204 --> 01:25:27.372
And he's taking it.

1074
01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:34.606
Police scanners are saying
computers are down

1075
01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:36.840
at Traffic Control Center.

1076
01:25:37.424 --> 01:25:38.967
Nice, Charlie.

1077
01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:42.554
What are you up to? Go back.

1078
01:25:51.772 --> 01:25:54.066
I now command you to turn left.

1079
01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:57.819
Come on, take the left.

1080
01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:01.907
Yeah, you did. You did.

1081
01:26:37.442 --> 01:26:38.735
Give us the flag.

1082
01:26:39.653 --> 01:26:42.739
Metro just passed through the station.
You are clear for 90 seconds.

1083
01:26:42.823 --> 01:26:43.949
Go.

1084
01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:01.591
Come on, Steve.

1085
01:27:17.858 --> 01:27:19.025
<i>Whoa!</i>

1086
01:27:23.530 --> 01:27:25.157
- Whoa!
- Look out!

1087
01:27:25.657 --> 01:27:26.950
30 seconds and counting.

1088
01:27:33.874 --> 01:27:36.752
15 seconds, you're either blocked in
or you're paint on the train.

1089
01:27:42.382 --> 01:27:44.551
Go, come on, come on, come on!

1090
01:27:44.885 --> 01:27:46.762
Stay right on me. This is gonna be tight.

1091
01:27:53.769 --> 01:27:55.020
Go!

1092
01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:56.813
You're gonna stop right there.

1093
01:28:35.685 --> 01:28:36.812
Okay, guys.

1094
01:28:36.895 --> 01:28:38.355
Coming into position.

1095
01:28:38.438 --> 01:28:39.773
Stay cool.

1096
01:28:52.118 --> 01:28:53.286
Ten,

1097
01:28:54.037 --> 01:28:55.288
nine,

1098
01:28:55.664 --> 01:28:56.957
eight,

1099
01:28:57.457 --> 01:28:58.625
seven,

1100
01:28:58.875 --> 01:29:00.043
Six,

1101
01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:01.503
five,

1102
01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:03.213
four...

1103
01:29:03.588 --> 01:29:04.982
Don't lose them, don't lose them,
don't lose them.

1104
01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:06.341
Three,

1105
01:29:06.466 --> 01:29:07.634
two,

1106
01:29:08.468 --> 01:29:09.511
one.

1107
01:29:31.533 --> 01:29:32.701
Damn.

1108
01:29:39.583 --> 01:29:40.834
Where's my truck?

1109
01:29:40.917 --> 01:29:43.420
What? What the fuck
happened to my truck?

1110
01:29:47.757 --> 01:29:49.676
It just blew right through the street.

1111
01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:51.511
Well, get under there.

1112
01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:05.775
- We have another problem, guys.
- What?

1113
01:30:07.027 --> 01:30:09.696
- This isn't the Worthington 1000.
- What?

1114
01:30:10.697 --> 01:30:12.699
He switched safes on us.

1115
01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:16.369
- Can you do it?
- It's Israeli made.

1116
01:30:16.453 --> 01:30:18.121
It's got a glass re-lock system.

1117
01:30:18.204 --> 01:30:20.332
There's a pane of glass right here,
behind this door

1118
01:30:20.415 --> 01:30:22.667
and if I don't drill perfectly
through that hole,

1119
01:30:22.751 --> 01:30:25.128
steel rods snap into place
and you can't open the safe,

1120
01:30:25.211 --> 01:30:26.922
and then we're up shit creek.

1121
01:30:57.827 --> 01:31:00.163
I think I just cracked the glass.

1122
01:31:01.581 --> 01:31:03.583
I don't think it broke, though.

1123
01:31:04.167 --> 01:31:06.086
I can't drill it again.

1124
01:31:06.962 --> 01:31:08.505
I have to do it by touch.

1125
01:31:10.632 --> 01:31:13.510
I can't get through.
The train's blocking the tunnel.

1126
01:31:13.677 --> 01:31:15.679
Quick. Where does the Metro Rail
come above ground?

1127
01:31:15.762 --> 01:31:16.846
11th and Fig.

1128
01:31:16.930 --> 01:31:18.223
Positions two and three,

1129
01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:20.433
meet at 11th and Figueroa
and double back

1130
01:31:20.517 --> 01:31:22.060
to Hollywood and Highland.

1131
01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:23.186
Hurry up!

1132
01:31:37.742 --> 01:31:39.327
Your attention, please.

1133
01:31:39.452 --> 01:31:41.413
Baggage for train number 22

1134
01:31:41.496 --> 01:31:44.374
is now available
at carousel number four.

1135
01:31:44.457 --> 01:31:47.002
Baggage for train number 22
is now available

1136
01:31:47.127 --> 01:31:48.545
at carousel number four.

1137
01:32:23.496 --> 01:32:25.206
- Can't do this, Charlie.
- Stella.

1138
01:32:25.290 --> 01:32:27.184
I can't do it.
I need a drill, a borescope, something.

1139
01:32:27.208 --> 01:32:28.811
- I need to get in there.
- You don't need any of that.

1140
01:32:28.835 --> 01:32:30.045
Come on, Charlie.

1141
01:32:30.170 --> 01:32:31.921
Hey, you can do this.

1142
01:32:55.945 --> 01:32:57.030
Come on.

1143
01:33:28.478 --> 01:33:29.646
Slide.

1144
01:33:29.771 --> 01:33:31.147
Come on, come on, come on.

1145
01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:40.073
Hey, don't you want to see
what's inside?

1146
01:33:41.574 --> 01:33:43.076
Absolutely.

1147
01:33:46.913 --> 01:33:48.248
- Napster.
- Yeah.

1148
01:33:48.331 --> 01:33:50.750
Thirteen across, four high, four deep.

1149
01:33:52.418 --> 01:33:55.046
That's 208 bricks.

1150
01:33:55.130 --> 01:33:56.256
How much?

1151
01:33:56.339 --> 01:33:58.258
Oh. 208 times...

1152
01:34:02.262 --> 01:34:03.763
2.7.2.7 million dollars.

1153
01:34:03.847 --> 01:34:04.931
What?

1154
01:34:05.181 --> 01:34:07.976
No, it's 27. That's $27 million.

1155
01:34:08.059 --> 01:34:10.311
That's $27 million worth of gold.

1156
01:34:14.524 --> 01:34:16.109
Yeah!

1157
01:34:18.111 --> 01:34:20.822
Got the... Holy Spirit.

1158
01:34:21.281 --> 01:34:23.616
You should get on it. It's a good train.

1159
01:35:01.362 --> 01:35:02.822
What'd you think, John?

1160
01:35:11.331 --> 01:35:13.291
Twenty seven million.

1161
01:35:13.374 --> 01:35:14.375
Say it again.

1162
01:35:14.459 --> 01:35:16.169
- Twenty seven million.
- Say it again.

1163
01:35:16.252 --> 01:35:17.879
- Say it again!
- 27 million.

1164
01:35:17.962 --> 01:35:19.422
Say it again!

1165
01:35:43.363 --> 01:35:45.531
Got two motorcycles on us, Charlie.

1166
01:35:48.117 --> 01:35:51.162
I've got three Minis in a storm drain
heading east towards the LA River.

1167
01:35:51.246 --> 01:35:52.872
Stop them before they get to the street.

1168
01:35:58.378 --> 01:35:59.420
Shit!

1169
01:36:02.882 --> 01:36:03.967
<i>Whoa!</i>

1170
01:36:18.064 --> 01:36:19.399
Here we go.

1171
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:35.415
Open your door.

1172
01:36:40.795 --> 01:36:42.755
Come on, guys, we're moving.

1173
01:36:47.302 --> 01:36:48.803
There.

1174
01:36:58.354 --> 01:37:00.690
Hey, come on, come on. Look out.

1175
01:37:28.718 --> 01:37:29.969
Come on!

1176
01:37:36.893 --> 01:37:39.187
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

1177
01:37:58.081 --> 01:38:00.517
I'm going to take Steve.
You guys go straight to Union Station.

1178
01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:01.918
I'll meet you there.

1179
01:38:03.002 --> 01:38:04.587
Stay on him. Stay on him.

1180
01:38:13.221 --> 01:38:15.681
Okay, Charlie,
I'm opening up a spot on Lower Grand.

1181
01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:20.603
I know it's you, Charlie.

1182
01:38:22.188 --> 01:38:23.356
Take your next left.

1183
01:39:23.416 --> 01:39:24.750
Nice move, Steve.

1184
01:40:03.498 --> 01:40:04.540
Get out!

1185
01:40:04.624 --> 01:40:05.791
- Get out!
- Okay.

1186
01:40:05.875 --> 01:40:07.543
I said get out!

1187
01:41:42.555 --> 01:41:44.432
They got a bunch of cars in there, right?

1188
01:41:44.473 --> 01:41:45.766
Mini Coopers?

1189
01:41:46.142 --> 01:41:49.312
- Look, man, I don't know anything...
- Hey, don't worry about them.

1190
01:41:49.437 --> 01:41:51.772
I'll give you $5000
if you put me inside that car.

1191
01:41:56.611 --> 01:41:58.738
Buy your girlfriend something nice.

1192
01:42:04.076 --> 01:42:05.369
Come on.

1193
01:42:10.791 --> 01:42:13.419
Half now,
half when you help me unload.

1194
01:42:18.299 --> 01:42:20.551
I got to hand it to you, Steve,

1195
01:42:20.635 --> 01:42:23.387
you actually played this one pretty smart.

1196
01:42:23.471 --> 01:42:26.098
Decoy trucks, you switched safes.

1197
01:42:26.182 --> 01:42:29.393
The helicopter routine,
I mean, that was pretty damn good.

1198
01:42:29.477 --> 01:42:32.480
But now I've got the gold
and you, you've got nothing.

1199
01:42:32.605 --> 01:42:33.689
I got this.

1200
01:42:33.773 --> 01:42:36.692
So cut the crap,
and give me my goddamn gold!

1201
01:42:51.207 --> 01:42:52.667
Who the hell are you?

1202
01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:54.293
I am Mashkov...

1203
01:42:54.794 --> 01:42:56.545
and you killed my cousin Yevhen.

1204
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:59.215
You gotta have some insurance, Steve.

1205
01:43:08.265 --> 01:43:10.434
Yevhen was already dead when I got there.

1206
01:43:10.518 --> 01:43:12.228
I'm sorry about that,
but Yevhen dealt with

1207
01:43:12.311 --> 01:43:14.980
a lot of unsavory people.
Now, this guy's trying to play you.

1208
01:43:15.064 --> 01:43:16.691
You were right...

1209
01:43:17.483 --> 01:43:19.151
no imagination.

1210
01:43:21.737 --> 01:43:23.614
There's a lot of gold in there.

1211
01:43:23.698 --> 01:43:26.701
We're the only ones with guns.
I'll make you a good deal.

1212
01:43:34.125 --> 01:43:36.168
I've already made my deal.

1213
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:43.259
What do you want?

1214
01:43:43.342 --> 01:43:45.511
You know this was never about the gold.

1215
01:43:45.553 --> 01:43:47.555
Whatever helps you sleep
at night, sweetheart.

1216
01:43:52.601 --> 01:43:55.146
Bitch! Charlie! Come on, Charlie!

1217
01:43:56.772 --> 01:43:58.816
- Okay.
- Beautiful.

1218
01:43:59.734 --> 01:44:01.068
That I love.

1219
01:44:01.193 --> 01:44:03.296
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

1220
01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:05.560
I'll double whatever he's given you.
Just don't shoot me.

1221
01:44:05.614 --> 01:44:08.200
Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot you.

1222
01:44:08.409 --> 01:44:10.619
No, I'm going to take you
to my workplace.

1223
01:44:10.995 --> 01:44:14.373
I think you'll be very interested
in some of the machinery I use.

1224
01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:16.625
Let's go.

1225
01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:18.043
No, come on.

1226
01:44:23.799 --> 01:44:25.968
Guys, I wanna make a toast.

1227
01:44:27.219 --> 01:44:28.888
To John Bridger...

1228
01:44:29.138 --> 01:44:31.640
the most brilliant master planner of all.

1229
01:44:31.724 --> 01:44:34.059
- Father and friend.
- To my dad.

1230
01:44:34.143 --> 01:44:35.478
- To John.
- To John.

1231
01:44:39.273 --> 01:44:42.318
Stella was right.
It wasn't about the money.

1232
01:44:42.401 --> 01:44:45.446
Of course, that didn't stop the guys
from having a little bit of fun.

1233
01:44:46.989 --> 01:44:49.492
Handsome Rob got his Aston Martin.

1234
01:44:53.996 --> 01:44:56.415
He took it for a ride to break it in.

1235
01:45:10.346 --> 01:45:12.306
He got off with a warning.

1236
01:45:15.059 --> 01:45:18.479
Left Ear got his dream house
in the south of Spain...

1237
01:45:18.562 --> 01:45:20.815
with a room just for his shoes.

1238
01:45:29.448 --> 01:45:32.618
Lyle finally made the cover
of Wired magazine.

1239
01:45:35.579 --> 01:45:37.832
Are you really the Napster?

1240
01:45:39.458 --> 01:45:40.626
Yes, I am.

1241
01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:43.546
And he got that
kick-ass stereo he wanted.

1242
01:45:45.297 --> 01:45:46.799
Would you listen to something for me?

1243
01:45:46.882 --> 01:45:50.469
With speakers so loud,
it could blow a woman's clothes off.

1244
01:45:54.056 --> 01:45:55.558
If you would.

1245
01:46:10.865 --> 01:46:12.074
And me?

1246
01:46:12.658 --> 01:46:14.869
I took John Bridger's advice.

1247
01:46:15.661 --> 01:46:18.414
I found somebody
I wanna spend the rest of my life with...

1248
01:46:18.956 --> 01:46:21.542
and I'm gonna hold on to her forever.
