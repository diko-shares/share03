<i>Early man's struggle for surv</i>i<i>val</i>

9
00:02:13.944 --> 00:02:15.013
Professor!

10
00:02:15.904 --> 00:02:17.053
Behind you!

11
00:02:27.224 --> 00:02:28.213
Yikes!

12
00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:32.297
Stay right there!

13
00:02:41.664 --> 00:02:44.019
-Shaggy!
-Now, Scoob!

14
00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:52.299
-The trap worked, Scoob!
-Yeah!

15
00:02:53.704 --> 00:02:54.898
Give me four!

16
00:02:58.704 --> 00:03:02.094
-You're the man, Scoob.
-You're the man.

17
00:04:18.064 --> 00:04:20.100
Nice going, guys. You caught 'em.

18
00:04:21.504 --> 00:04:23.699
Right. No problem, Freddy.

19
00:04:23.864 --> 00:04:25.502
But we had a little help.

20
00:04:25.584 --> 00:04:26.699
Who are you?

21
00:04:27.624 --> 00:04:29.137
l don't believe it!

22
00:04:29.384 --> 00:04:32.615
You're Ben Ravencroft,
the famous horror writer.

23
00:04:33.024 --> 00:04:34.173
That's right.

24
00:04:34.744 --> 00:04:36.735
And let's see who they are.

25
00:04:41.144 --> 00:04:42.497
lt's Perkins.

26
00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:48.778
And Griswold. Disgruntled archaeologists
from the museum's Babylonian project.

27
00:04:49.144 --> 00:04:52.181
They were upset with you
for cutting their funding, Dr. Dean.

28
00:04:52.344 --> 00:04:55.017
And we would have
gotten away with it, too.. .

29
00:04:55.104 --> 00:04:57.902
if it wasn't for this meddling writer!

30
00:05:01.144 --> 00:05:02.623
That's a twist!

31
00:05:02.744 --> 00:05:06.419
Yeah. At least he didn't call us ''kids."
l hate that.

32
00:05:06.664 --> 00:05:09.224
You beat us to the punch, Mr. Ravencroft.

33
00:05:09.664 --> 00:05:12.462
Sorry, l didn't mean to upstage you.

34
00:05:12.584 --> 00:05:14.336
So what were you doing here?

35
00:05:14.424 --> 00:05:16.733
l was doing research on my latest novel.. .

36
00:05:16.824 --> 00:05:19.736
when l saw the archaeologists
acting suspiciously.. .

37
00:05:19.824 --> 00:05:21.496
and decided to investigate.

38
00:05:21.664 --> 00:05:25.543
Mr. Ravencroft,
l am a huge fan of your work.

39
00:05:25.744 --> 00:05:28.781
l've read all your books,
which in my opinion.. .

40
00:05:28.864 --> 00:05:31.094
are the best horror stories ever written.

41
00:05:31.504 --> 00:05:33.301
Thanks, Velma.

42
00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:36.256
You know my name?

43
00:05:36.344 --> 00:05:38.141
And Daphne's and Fred's.

44
00:05:42.824 --> 00:05:44.894
And Scooby and Shaggy, of course.

45
00:05:46.544 --> 00:05:49.183
l've admired your work
unraveling supernatural mysteries.. .

46
00:05:49.264 --> 00:05:50.583
for some time now.

47
00:05:50.824 --> 00:05:54.100
We're in the same business
of ''mystery and the occult." Right?

48
00:05:54.384 --> 00:05:55.373
Please.

49
00:05:55.624 --> 00:06:00.334
What we do pales in comparison with
the sheer palpable fright of your novels.

50
00:06:00.904 --> 00:06:04.101
-l wouldn't say that.
-Take <i>The Dead Mal</i>l, for example.

51
00:06:04.184 --> 00:06:08.223
That creepy jewelry-store owner
was an incredibly complex character.

52
00:06:08.304 --> 00:06:09.339
You're very kind.

53
00:06:10.224 --> 00:06:13.261
Listen, Velma,
l'm going back to my hometown.. .

54
00:06:13.424 --> 00:06:15.221
in Massachusetts this weekend.. .

55
00:06:15.384 --> 00:06:17.614
to the house where l wrote
my early books.

56
00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:22.215
l go back every year for the fall color.
lt's very peaceful and relaxing.

57
00:06:22.624 --> 00:06:24.899
Why don't you
and your friends come visit?

58
00:06:25.944 --> 00:06:30.256
Really? That would be great,
wouldn't it, gang?

59
00:06:30.544 --> 00:06:34.173
Yeah. We could use a break
from all these spooky mysteries.

60
00:06:34.464 --> 00:06:39.219
And Oakhaven does have one
of the best restaurants in New England.

61
00:06:39.464 --> 00:06:42.536
-We're sold, eh, Scoob?
-Yeah!

62
00:07:17.984 --> 00:07:20.623
This color is spectacular, right, guys?

63
00:07:21.464 --> 00:07:22.817
-Amazing!
-Yeah!

64
00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:25.020
Don't forget me, old buddy.

65
00:07:40.424 --> 00:07:42.062
And that scene at the end.. .

66
00:07:42.144 --> 00:07:45.420
where the caretaker's flesh dissolved
was so brilliant l--

67
00:07:45.504 --> 00:07:46.778
Look, we're here.

68
00:07:47.184 --> 00:07:48.378
Already?

69
00:07:57.544 --> 00:07:59.262
Welcome to Oakhaven!

70
00:07:59.944 --> 00:08:00.933
What?

71
00:08:02.624 --> 00:08:05.422
l thought you said
this was a quiet little town.

72
00:08:05.504 --> 00:08:06.493
lt was.

73
00:08:06.624 --> 00:08:09.013
This is a pretty popular spot.

74
00:08:11.504 --> 00:08:14.655
Sure, we always get a few leaf peepers,
but never like this.

75
00:08:14.864 --> 00:08:17.537
This is a circus!

76
00:08:18.104 --> 00:08:20.743
There's the mayor.
He'll know what's going on!

77
00:08:22.584 --> 00:08:25.974
-Maybe he'll know a place to eat!
-Yeah!

78
00:08:27.384 --> 00:08:29.818
Welcome to old Oakhaven!

79
00:08:29.984 --> 00:08:31.940
Have a wonderful time!

80
00:08:32.824 --> 00:08:34.655
So glad you could come!

81
00:08:34.824 --> 00:08:36.621
Mayor! Mayor Corey!

82
00:08:36.824 --> 00:08:40.658
Ben, my boy!
l'm glad you could come home to see this!

83
00:08:40.744 --> 00:08:44.419
And l see you've brought some friends.
And their dog.

84
00:08:44.664 --> 00:08:46.302
Dog? Where?

85
00:08:47.304 --> 00:08:49.818
Welcome. The more the merrier.

86
00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:51.383
But what is all this?

87
00:08:51.464 --> 00:08:55.662
lt's great, isn't it? Business is booming.
Not like a few months ago.. .

88
00:08:55.864 --> 00:08:58.697
when it was slower than maple syrup
on a cold day!

89
00:08:58.944 --> 00:09:01.583
-Hey, Ben.
-Hi, Mr. McKnight.

90
00:09:01.784 --> 00:09:05.618
Welcome home.
Have a T-shirt before my store sells out!

91
00:09:05.864 --> 00:09:08.583
-You can wear it to the concert tomorrow.
-Concert?

92
00:09:08.704 --> 00:09:09.693
The Hex Girls.

93
00:09:09.784 --> 00:09:11.900
-You've heard of them, Fred?
-Just now.

94
00:09:16.104 --> 00:09:19.779
A local group. You'll like 'em.
Kind of spooky.

95
00:09:20.504 --> 00:09:24.383
''l Met The Ghost of Oakhaven
(and lived)''?

96
00:09:25.024 --> 00:09:26.013
Ghost?

97
00:09:26.104 --> 00:09:29.494
Jinkies, looks like there's a ghost
in your own backyard, Ben.

98
00:09:29.904 --> 00:09:33.374
Not only that, but it's his own ancestor.

99
00:09:33.664 --> 00:09:35.939
The ghost of Sarah Ravencroft.

100
00:09:36.544 --> 00:09:37.943
That's ridiculous.

101
00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:41.097
l thought we'd gotten past
all this witch nonsense.

102
00:09:41.264 --> 00:09:45.576
What can l say, Ben.
Ever since we built our ''Puritan Village''.. .

103
00:09:45.824 --> 00:09:48.054
her ghost has appeared many times.

104
00:09:48.664 --> 00:09:51.815
Don't tell me. You disturbed her spirit
with the construction.

105
00:09:52.064 --> 00:09:54.373
And now, she's haunting the town.

106
00:09:54.544 --> 00:09:55.897
How did you know?

107
00:09:56.144 --> 00:09:58.783
-Ghost hunting's our specialty.
-l see.

108
00:09:59.184 --> 00:10:01.573
Did you say, ''Puritan Village''?

109
00:10:15.944 --> 00:10:20.938
What you're seeing is a perfect re-creation
of what life was like back in the 1600s.. .

110
00:10:21.384 --> 00:10:23.420
as reenacted by our locals.

111
00:10:23.984 --> 00:10:25.736
When did all this go up?

112
00:10:25.864 --> 00:10:27.502
About six months ago.

113
00:10:27.904 --> 00:10:29.622
This is amazing, Mayor!

114
00:10:33.504 --> 00:10:35.574
Corn husk dolls!

115
00:10:35.704 --> 00:10:38.776
-Aren't they cute?
-Yeah, charming.

116
00:10:39.984 --> 00:10:41.019
Look, Scoob.

117
00:10:41.104 --> 00:10:42.856
l've been a bad boy.

118
00:10:50.864 --> 00:10:52.582
Wouldst thou like to churn?

119
00:10:53.944 --> 00:10:56.902
lt's your turn to churn the butter,
old buddy.

120
00:11:19.864 --> 00:11:22.014
Now all we need is the popcorn.

121
00:11:24.704 --> 00:11:27.013
So you say a ghost has been
appearing here?

122
00:11:27.144 --> 00:11:31.979
That's right, young lady.
Apparently we disturbed the spirit.. .

123
00:11:32.224 --> 00:11:35.899
of Ben's ancestor,
who was persecuted as a witch.. .

124
00:11:35.984 --> 00:11:37.940
way back in 1657.

125
00:11:38.224 --> 00:11:40.101
Unjustly persecuted.

126
00:11:40.624 --> 00:11:43.980
Sarah Ravencroft was a medicine woman
who practiced natural healing.. .

127
00:11:44.064 --> 00:11:47.181
and was unfairly accused
because of her eccentric ways.

128
00:11:47.384 --> 00:11:49.181
Just like the Salem witch trials.

129
00:11:49.264 --> 00:11:51.539
Many men and women
who were a bit different.. .

130
00:11:51.624 --> 00:11:55.503
or didn't conform to the codes
of the colony suffered the same fate.

131
00:11:56.264 --> 00:11:57.856
Sarah was a healer.

132
00:11:58.064 --> 00:12:00.737
lt was said she even kept a journal
of all the patients.. .

133
00:12:00.824 --> 00:12:02.655
she cured with her herbal remedies.

134
00:12:05.944 --> 00:12:07.263
Look, Shaggy!

135
00:12:12.504 --> 00:12:14.540
lt's a perfect fit, Scoob!

136
00:12:35.264 --> 00:12:36.697
Easy, Scoob.

137
00:12:40.144 --> 00:12:42.214
What do you got there, old buddy?

138
00:12:43.544 --> 00:12:44.533
l don't know!

139
00:12:44.744 --> 00:12:45.938
Wonder what this is.

140
00:12:46.024 --> 00:12:48.982
Looks like you've found
an old shoe buckle, my boy.

141
00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:51.704
Probably over 400 years old.

142
00:12:52.144 --> 00:12:53.213
Cool.

143
00:12:56.104 --> 00:12:59.938
Look for another one,
so l can have a matching pair.

144
00:13:00.024 --> 00:13:01.013
Okay.

145
00:13:01.104 --> 00:13:04.653
We've found all sorts of items
from the old colony.. .

146
00:13:04.744 --> 00:13:07.019
when we cleared this area
for construction.

147
00:13:07.104 --> 00:13:09.937
Handmade nails, horseshoes,
farm equipment.

148
00:13:10.024 --> 00:13:12.584
-How about a book?
-A book?

149
00:13:12.704 --> 00:13:15.935
You know how long l've been searching
for Sarah's journal.. .

150
00:13:16.024 --> 00:13:18.094
to officially clear our family name.

151
00:13:18.504 --> 00:13:20.381
Sorry, Ben. Nothing like that.

152
00:13:20.784 --> 00:13:23.582
What makes you think
it's Sarah's ghost haunting this place?

153
00:13:23.664 --> 00:13:27.703
Because the ghost said so.
Maybe you'll see her tonight.

154
00:13:28.024 --> 00:13:29.980
-Oh, boy.
-You never know, Fred.

155
00:13:32.824 --> 00:13:36.658
We'd like to see a Puritan pizza joint.
We're starved!

156
00:13:36.744 --> 00:13:37.733
Yeah!

157
00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:42.736
Don't worry, boys. We've got
the best restaurant in all New England.

158
00:13:42.944 --> 00:13:45.299
lt's back in town. l'll walk you there.

159
00:13:46.144 --> 00:13:49.216
Do you kids want to go,
or would you like to see my studio?

160
00:13:50.104 --> 00:13:51.219
Would we ever.

161
00:13:51.984 --> 00:13:54.100
Shaggy, we'll meet up with you later.

162
00:13:54.184 --> 00:13:57.938
Mayor, tell Jack
that anything they order is on me.

163
00:13:59.104 --> 00:14:02.096
-What a great guy!
-Yeah, great!

164
00:14:04.904 --> 00:14:07.338
You're gonna regret that offer, Ben.

165
00:14:20.024 --> 00:14:24.779
Jack's gonna take good care of you, boys.
You're gonna love his cooking.

166
00:14:24.944 --> 00:14:26.775
l'm sure we will, Your Honor.

167
00:14:26.864 --> 00:14:30.698
-Enjoy your stay at Oakhaven.
-Thanks, your dudeness.

168
00:14:42.304 --> 00:14:46.058
-Well, boys. Are you hungry?
-Man, are we ever.

169
00:14:46.144 --> 00:14:50.660
Come on over here to the back.
l always have a table open for VlPs!

170
00:14:50.744 --> 00:14:51.733
Groovy!

171
00:14:51.824 --> 00:14:52.893
Come on, Scoob!

172
00:14:54.304 --> 00:14:58.422
You're Mr. Ravencroft's guests,
so order up anything on the menu, boys.

173
00:14:58.744 --> 00:15:01.383
l've got a nice, juicy ham bone
for your dog.

174
00:15:02.144 --> 00:15:04.214
-What do you think?
-Bones? Yuck!

175
00:15:06.064 --> 00:15:07.975
Scooby's allergic to bones.

176
00:15:08.064 --> 00:15:10.100
We'll have whatever that great smell is!

177
00:15:10.184 --> 00:15:13.859
That's Yankee pot roast,
New England clam chowder.. .

178
00:15:13.944 --> 00:15:17.061
maple-baked ham and beans,
roast turkey.. .

179
00:15:17.224 --> 00:15:22.059
with chestnut stuffing,
and apple-cinnamon pie.

180
00:15:25.744 --> 00:15:29.020
Sounds great.
Give us two orders of everything.

181
00:15:30.224 --> 00:15:32.454
l love people who love to eat.

182
00:15:38.264 --> 00:15:41.301
So this is where it all started!

183
00:15:42.224 --> 00:15:47.173
Yes, l wrote all my early novels here.
Now l spend most of my time in Europe.

184
00:15:47.264 --> 00:15:50.301
But l come back once a year
to recharge my batteries.

185
00:15:51.264 --> 00:15:53.539
Go ahead, Velma. Sit down.

186
00:15:55.304 --> 00:15:58.740
Jinkies! This is a dream come true.

187
00:15:59.944 --> 00:16:03.016
-You have some cool things here, Ben.
-l'll say.

188
00:16:05.504 --> 00:16:07.142
Whose portrait is this?

189
00:16:07.224 --> 00:16:09.340
This is Sarah Ravencroft.

190
00:16:09.784 --> 00:16:12.014
l think it was painted by a grateful patient.

191
00:16:15.464 --> 00:16:18.342
<i>Of course, she wasn't very popular</i>
<i>w</i>i<i>th the town's doctors.</i>

192
00:16:18.584 --> 00:16:21.417
<i>Sarah was untrad</i>i<i>t</i>i<i>onal</i>
i<i>n her approach to med</i>i<i>c</i>i<i>ne.</i>

193
00:16:21.504 --> 00:16:23.734
<i>-She was a W</i>i<i>ccan.</i>
<i>-Say what?</i>

194
00:16:24.024 --> 00:16:27.096
<i>l've read about them.</i>
<i>W</i>i<i>ccans were people who were</i> i<i>n tune...</i>

195
00:16:27.224 --> 00:16:30.455
<i>w</i>i<i>th the forces of nature,</i>
<i>and used them for heal</i>i<i>ng purposes.</i>

196
00:16:30.744 --> 00:16:34.817
<i>Exactly. She bel</i>i<i>eved</i> i<i>n us</i>i<i>ng herbs</i>
<i>and other natural elements...</i>

197
00:16:35.184 --> 00:16:37.778
<i>to draw from the earth's powers</i>
<i>to heal the s</i>i<i>ck.</i>

198
00:16:38.304 --> 00:16:41.614
<i>Sarah helped many people</i>
<i>who could not afford med</i>i<i>cal treatment.</i>

199
00:16:43.504 --> 00:16:46.302
<i>She treated her pat</i>i<i>ents</i>
<i>under a large oak tree...</i>

200
00:16:46.424 --> 00:16:49.894
<i>wh</i>i<i>ch she bel</i>i<i>eved to have</i>
<i>heal</i>i<i>ng powers.</i>

201
00:16:56.344 --> 00:17:00.178
l saw a huge oak tree like that
in the town square.

202
00:17:00.344 --> 00:17:04.132
l've already searched the area around
that tree, but never found anything.

203
00:17:04.504 --> 00:17:06.893
That book could finally prove
Sarah's innocence.. .

204
00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:09.418
and that she was a Wiccan,
not an evil witch.

205
00:17:09.504 --> 00:17:12.462
Wiccans have been misunderstood,
accused of sorcery.

206
00:17:12.744 --> 00:17:15.099
ln fact, the word ''witch''
comes from ''Wicca."

207
00:17:15.184 --> 00:17:16.822
l'm impressed, Velma.

208
00:17:16.984 --> 00:17:19.498
You know, doing research
on Sarah and the Wiccans.. .

209
00:17:19.584 --> 00:17:22.621
led me to read almost everything
on the world of superstition.

210
00:17:22.984 --> 00:17:26.215
That's how l started writing stories
to frighten people.

211
00:18:00.224 --> 00:18:02.055
l've never seen anything like this.

212
00:18:02.144 --> 00:18:04.499
Are you at least tasting my food?

213
00:18:07.144 --> 00:18:09.897
lt's the best food we've ever had.

214
00:18:10.984 --> 00:18:12.975
Delicious!

215
00:18:40.584 --> 00:18:42.893
So, how's the food?

216
00:18:43.584 --> 00:18:45.415
Pretty darn good!

217
00:18:45.544 --> 00:18:47.535
ls there anything left in the kitchen?

218
00:18:47.664 --> 00:18:51.134
l'll be right back, boys.
l've got to make a run to the market.

219
00:18:52.104 --> 00:18:53.457
lt's getting dark, guys.

220
00:18:53.544 --> 00:18:56.104
Let's go see if that ghost
will make an appearance.

221
00:18:57.384 --> 00:19:00.535
We'd love to,
but we haven't had our dessert yet.

222
00:19:00.624 --> 00:19:02.262
Yeah, yeah!

223
00:19:02.344 --> 00:19:06.178
Okay, but after you finish,
meet us at the Puritan Village.

224
00:19:06.624 --> 00:19:08.057
Ben's already gone ahead.

225
00:19:08.984 --> 00:19:13.136
lf the ghost gets there first,
just start screaming without us.

226
00:19:34.344 --> 00:19:37.734
Come on, we've been waiting an hour.
The ghost is a no-show.

227
00:19:38.024 --> 00:19:40.254
Maybe she'll show up
at the concert tomorrow.

228
00:19:42.304 --> 00:19:47.059
Too bad. l was hoping to have
a little chat with my ghostly ancestor.

229
00:19:47.224 --> 00:19:49.977
l wanted to ask her
where she hid her journal.

230
00:19:50.064 --> 00:19:54.421
-Ben is obsessed with that book.
-l'll say.

231
00:19:54.544 --> 00:19:56.296
We should leave, too.

232
00:19:56.624 --> 00:19:58.535
Let's give it a chance, Ben.

233
00:19:58.624 --> 00:20:01.661
Yeah, it's probably
a hokey bed sheet on a wire or something.

234
00:20:01.744 --> 00:20:03.143
This could be funny.

235
00:20:07.664 --> 00:20:11.134
Thanks for everything, Jack. lt was great.

236
00:20:11.304 --> 00:20:13.579
Especially those last 12 pies.

237
00:20:14.784 --> 00:20:16.183
Glad you liked them.

238
00:20:21.264 --> 00:20:24.381
-Was that good eating or what, Scoob?
-Yeah!

239
00:20:27.064 --> 00:20:28.383
Excuse me.

240
00:20:29.104 --> 00:20:33.222
Gee, looks like everybody's leaving.
l wonder if the ghost showed up.

241
00:20:39.104 --> 00:20:41.095
With no one here.. .

242
00:20:41.424 --> 00:20:44.063
this place is almost spooky, Scoob.

243
00:20:55.224 --> 00:20:57.374
-Girls!
-Yeah, girls!

244
00:21:03.664 --> 00:21:05.416
Hi, girls.

245
00:21:06.224 --> 00:21:07.577
Hi.

246
00:21:15.704 --> 00:21:17.774
l think we lost them, old buddy.

247
00:21:21.104 --> 00:21:24.301
And l thought there was
only one ghost witch!

248
00:21:24.464 --> 00:21:25.499
Yeah!

249
00:21:25.704 --> 00:21:30.380
Anyway, with all that running
we worked off that big meal.

250
00:21:30.664 --> 00:21:33.462
But you know, now l'm hungry again.

251
00:21:33.744 --> 00:21:34.813
Me, too.

252
00:21:44.704 --> 00:21:48.538
This town shall pay for what it did to me!

253
00:21:58.144 --> 00:22:00.738
lt's every coward for himself, old buddy!

254
00:22:04.144 --> 00:22:06.612
-What's going on, guys?
-''Rhost! ''

255
00:22:06.784 --> 00:22:07.899
A roast?

256
00:22:10.824 --> 00:22:14.100
-Witch's ghost!
-You saw the witch's ghost?

257
00:22:14.264 --> 00:22:15.253
Yeah.

258
00:22:20.744 --> 00:22:22.018
Can you show us where?

259
00:22:22.104 --> 00:22:25.380
Do we have to? She throws fireballs, man.

260
00:22:26.464 --> 00:22:29.262
Can you at least get off me first, Freddy?

261
00:22:29.504 --> 00:22:31.495
Gee, sorry, Daph.

262
00:22:34.424 --> 00:22:36.813
Down this street.

263
00:22:41.624 --> 00:22:43.580
There's no one here now.

264
00:22:43.664 --> 00:22:46.861
We thought we'd gotten away
from the first three witches.. .

265
00:22:47.264 --> 00:22:50.222
when this ghost chased us
from down there!

266
00:22:50.464 --> 00:22:52.102
First three witches?

267
00:22:53.264 --> 00:22:55.698
You said she threw fireballs, right?

268
00:22:56.264 --> 00:23:00.416
lt was like this, Velma,
but a thousand times worse!

269
00:23:00.944 --> 00:23:04.698
-ls this the street she chased you down?
-Don't remind us!

270
00:23:08.304 --> 00:23:10.295
Check out these branches!

271
00:23:10.944 --> 00:23:13.378
They were all broken
from the tops of these trees!

272
00:23:13.464 --> 00:23:15.819
And in a perfectly straight line.

273
00:23:16.024 --> 00:23:18.174
This is getting interesting, Ben.

274
00:23:22.944 --> 00:23:25.697
-Shaggy!
-Not again!

275
00:23:26.304 --> 00:23:27.498
What is that?

276
00:23:28.904 --> 00:23:30.462
Let's go see!

277
00:23:48.624 --> 00:23:50.262
Hit it, sisters.

278
00:23:52.704 --> 00:23:55.264
Zoinks! lt's the witches!

279
00:23:55.824 --> 00:23:57.974
Easy, guys! lt's just the Hex Girls.

280
00:25:39.744 --> 00:25:42.019
Thanks. What are you doing here?

281
00:25:42.384 --> 00:25:44.022
The concert's tomorrow.

282
00:25:45.704 --> 00:25:47.581
Hey, wait a minute.

283
00:25:48.104 --> 00:25:49.856
Aren't you Ben Ravencroft?

284
00:25:50.824 --> 00:25:53.702
Why? You're not gonna bite me, are you?

285
00:25:53.824 --> 00:25:56.577
Cool. l've always wanted to meet you.

286
00:25:57.344 --> 00:25:59.414
You're like one of us.

287
00:25:59.504 --> 00:26:02.496
Yeah, you understand what we're into.

288
00:26:06.384 --> 00:26:07.578
Hi.

289
00:26:08.904 --> 00:26:10.860
That's quite an act, Miss.. ..

290
00:26:11.144 --> 00:26:15.581
Thorn. This is Dusk and Luna.
We're Eco-Goths.

291
00:26:15.664 --> 00:26:17.017
Eco-Goths?

292
00:26:17.104 --> 00:26:18.935
And we don't need your approval.

293
00:26:19.424 --> 00:26:23.975
Gee, all those explosions at the end
were pretty mystifying, eh, Velma?

294
00:26:24.064 --> 00:26:26.419
Yeah, very mystifying.

295
00:26:26.544 --> 00:26:31.493
-So, where are you girls from?
-Oakhaven, but we won't be here for long.

296
00:26:31.664 --> 00:26:35.737
We're close to cutting our first CD.
Well, it's been killer meeting you.

297
00:26:35.824 --> 00:26:36.813
Same here.

298
00:26:36.904 --> 00:26:39.099
But we've got to get back to our rehearsal.

299
00:26:44.504 --> 00:26:47.098
Those Hex Girls seem kind of suspicious.

300
00:26:47.384 --> 00:26:50.057
-l'll say.
-Daph and l should keep an eye on them.

301
00:26:50.184 --> 00:26:53.938
Gee, why is it that you always
pair off with Daphne?

302
00:26:55.024 --> 00:26:57.584
-Well.. ..
-Never mind. lt's a good idea.

303
00:26:57.784 --> 00:27:01.459
You two stay here. l'll take another look
at where the guys saw that ghost.

304
00:27:02.944 --> 00:27:04.093
Come on.

305
00:27:12.504 --> 00:27:14.495
Let's take a look behind these trees.

306
00:27:21.224 --> 00:27:23.738
What are all these tire tracks
doing back here?

307
00:27:23.864 --> 00:27:25.980
Strange. The road's back there.

308
00:27:26.064 --> 00:27:29.022
Right. Let's see where these tracks lead.

309
00:27:29.144 --> 00:27:33.023
Can't we follow them tomorrow
after breakfast?

310
00:27:33.944 --> 00:27:35.536
l guess not.

311
00:27:54.944 --> 00:27:57.094
Jinkies! lt's the mayor.

312
00:27:57.544 --> 00:27:59.182
What's he doing here?

313
00:27:59.984 --> 00:28:03.101
l don't know, but we're gonna find out
what's in that barn.

314
00:28:03.664 --> 00:28:06.736
-Scooby and Shaggy will follow the mayor.
-We will?

315
00:28:06.824 --> 00:28:10.578
Fine. Then you search the barn,
and we'll follow the mayor.

316
00:28:13.464 --> 00:28:16.217
On second thought, we'll take the mayor.

317
00:28:16.304 --> 00:28:19.102
He'll never know we're on his tail,
eh, Scoob?

318
00:28:24.744 --> 00:28:25.859
Sorry, Scoob.

319
00:29:11.824 --> 00:29:14.179
There's got to be another way in here.

320
00:29:18.864 --> 00:29:23.016
So, Freddy, why do you always pair us up?

321
00:29:24.104 --> 00:29:27.733
Well, l've thought about that
for the longest time, and.. .

322
00:29:27.904 --> 00:29:30.293
there's never been a good time to tell you.

323
00:29:31.064 --> 00:29:32.543
Maybe it's time that l.. .

324
00:29:32.904 --> 00:29:33.939
that l.. ..

325
00:29:34.744 --> 00:29:36.143
Hey, here they come.

326
00:29:40.064 --> 00:29:43.898
l think we're going to need
to perform our ritual, girls.

327
00:29:44.384 --> 00:29:45.976
Not tonight, Thorn.

328
00:29:46.384 --> 00:29:49.103
My powers are weak from rehearsing.

329
00:29:49.264 --> 00:29:52.620
Mine, too. How about tomorrow
just before the concert?

330
00:29:52.904 --> 00:29:55.623
Never mind. l'll do it myself.

331
00:29:56.184 --> 00:29:59.301
See you in the morning.
Bad dreams, sisters.

332
00:29:59.584 --> 00:30:02.018
Bad dreams, sister Thorn.

333
00:30:05.144 --> 00:30:09.057
Did you hear that, Daph? Those girls
have something to do with this ghost.

334
00:30:09.384 --> 00:30:10.783
l'm sure of it.

335
00:30:10.864 --> 00:30:13.458
Thorn seems like the leader.
Let's follow her.

336
00:30:13.544 --> 00:30:17.014
Are you're sure
you're not just stuck on Thorn?

337
00:30:24.584 --> 00:30:25.858
Just a little higher.

338
00:30:26.544 --> 00:30:27.818
l can't.

339
00:30:29.864 --> 00:30:32.139
-That's great.
-Wonderful.

340
00:30:33.264 --> 00:30:34.379
l'm in.

341
00:30:37.344 --> 00:30:39.141
Velma, are you okay?

342
00:30:40.544 --> 00:30:41.613
Fine.

343
00:30:43.344 --> 00:30:44.379
Come on.

344
00:30:51.904 --> 00:30:54.976
-This Mayor is one busy guy.
-Yeah.

345
00:30:55.744 --> 00:30:59.180
Okay, Willard. You take it easy, now.

346
00:31:09.224 --> 00:31:10.543
Young love.

347
00:31:33.384 --> 00:31:34.942
lt's still warm, Ben.

348
00:31:35.024 --> 00:31:37.822
But who would be driving it
this late at night?

349
00:31:37.904 --> 00:31:39.303
That's the mystery.

350
00:32:26.824 --> 00:32:27.893
What's she up to?

351
00:32:27.984 --> 00:32:29.542
lf l didn't know better.. .

352
00:32:30.264 --> 00:32:32.334
l'd say she was a witch.

353
00:32:59.424 --> 00:33:02.063
He won't ditch us that easily, Scoob!

354
00:33:19.384 --> 00:33:23.093
-Where do you think he went, Scoob?
-l don't know.

355
00:33:25.464 --> 00:33:28.934
How dare you disturb my resting place!

356
00:33:30.824 --> 00:33:33.292
This town will pay!

357
00:33:35.704 --> 00:33:38.855
Send them a bill. But leave us alone!

358
00:33:58.864 --> 00:34:02.823
-l can't see a thing without my glasses.
-Me either.

359
00:34:03.944 --> 00:34:05.093
Oh, sorry.

360
00:34:09.744 --> 00:34:11.097
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

361
00:34:12.944 --> 00:34:16.778
-Hey, what's going on?
-Ask Scooby and Shaggy.

362
00:34:16.904 --> 00:34:19.657
-Where are they?
-That's no mystery.

363
00:34:21.864 --> 00:34:23.502
So what happened, guys?

364
00:34:24.224 --> 00:34:26.977
We followed the mayor
to some warehouse.. .

365
00:34:27.184 --> 00:34:29.175
and that ghost attacked us!

366
00:34:29.304 --> 00:34:32.740
He did?
There goes my cherry picker theory.

367
00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:36.419
Cherry picker theory? Wait till you hear
what we saw at Thorn's place.

368
00:34:36.704 --> 00:34:40.379
Hey! We were reporting first,
right, Scoob?

369
00:34:41.144 --> 00:34:44.659
The mayor's one busy guy.
Picking things up.. .

370
00:34:46.064 --> 00:34:48.100
and dropping things off.

371
00:34:48.224 --> 00:34:49.339
Like what?

372
00:34:49.504 --> 00:34:51.540
What is going on here?

373
00:34:51.904 --> 00:34:54.099
What's the big idea of running over me?

374
00:34:56.944 --> 00:35:01.335
As you can see, there's nothing here
except a damaged wall.

375
00:35:03.704 --> 00:35:05.501
Sorry about that, Mayor.

376
00:35:05.744 --> 00:35:08.497
Scooby and Shaggy just lose it
when they get scared.

377
00:35:08.664 --> 00:35:11.815
ln fact, l'm worried
that staying in Oakhaven.. .

378
00:35:11.904 --> 00:35:14.862
might just be too frightening
an experience for them.

379
00:35:15.104 --> 00:35:16.742
l think we should leave.

380
00:35:17.744 --> 00:35:18.733
Really?

381
00:35:20.584 --> 00:35:22.939
l'm sorry to hear that.

382
00:35:23.224 --> 00:35:27.263
But l need to get one more clue
before the night is over.

383
00:35:28.864 --> 00:35:32.300
Then l think l can solve the mystery
of the witch's ghost.. .

384
00:35:32.464 --> 00:35:34.341
before tomorrow's Autumn Fest.

385
00:35:34.784 --> 00:35:38.538
Great. l'll do anything l can to help.

386
00:35:44.384 --> 00:35:46.978
l should've known
leaving wasn't an option.

387
00:35:47.784 --> 00:35:49.695
What was that all about, Velma?

388
00:35:50.064 --> 00:35:51.861
You've got a plan, right?

389
00:35:53.504 --> 00:35:55.301
Here's what we're going to do.. ..

390
00:36:14.504 --> 00:36:15.493
Hey!

391
00:36:17.504 --> 00:36:18.493
Sorry.

392
00:36:20.464 --> 00:36:22.261
Why'd you stop, old buddy?

393
00:36:23.264 --> 00:36:25.334
No one touches my keyboard!

394
00:36:31.304 --> 00:36:32.896
Thanks for coming, girls.

395
00:36:32.984 --> 00:36:35.817
We should all be home
resting for the concert tomorrow.

396
00:36:36.224 --> 00:36:38.613
We only came because Ben asked us to.

397
00:36:39.104 --> 00:36:41.379
Hey, l'm just following orders.

398
00:36:41.624 --> 00:36:43.421
Well, what do you want?

399
00:37:00.344 --> 00:37:03.302
The town must pay for its foul deed!

400
00:37:14.424 --> 00:37:17.780
Help me! l've fallen and l can't get up!

401
00:37:21.704 --> 00:37:22.693
Now!

402
00:37:26.944 --> 00:37:27.933
Yes!

403
00:37:32.064 --> 00:37:33.497
You did it, guys!

404
00:37:36.024 --> 00:37:38.618
Okay, let's see who's behind all this.

405
00:37:41.744 --> 00:37:45.862
-lt's the T-shirt guy!
-Mr. McKnight the pharmacist?

406
00:37:48.784 --> 00:37:49.853
Daddy?

407
00:37:51.944 --> 00:37:53.263
Hello, Sally.

408
00:37:54.144 --> 00:37:55.816
Your dad's the ghost?

409
00:37:56.024 --> 00:37:57.616
Your name is Sally?

410
00:37:57.824 --> 00:38:01.499
l don't believe this, Daddy.
Why would you do something like this?

411
00:38:01.664 --> 00:38:03.416
You mean you didn't know?

412
00:38:05.024 --> 00:38:07.094
The girls have nothing to do with this.

413
00:38:07.184 --> 00:38:09.982
What in the world
is going on this evening?

414
00:38:11.344 --> 00:38:12.902
ls that you, McKnight?

415
00:38:13.224 --> 00:38:14.623
Maybe l can explain.

416
00:38:14.864 --> 00:38:18.573
l found flash powder residue
where Shag and Scoob saw the ghost.

417
00:38:18.704 --> 00:38:23.220
This is a device to throw the fireball,
which are just wads of flash paper.

418
00:38:23.384 --> 00:38:25.614
He got it from his daughter's stage props.

419
00:38:29.704 --> 00:38:31.137
What's that?

420
00:38:32.864 --> 00:38:36.061
lt's the cherry picker
that made the ghost fly above the trees.. .

421
00:38:36.144 --> 00:38:38.374
with the use of an extension device.

422
00:38:38.464 --> 00:38:41.456
And there's the fan
that created the eerie wind.

423
00:38:41.904 --> 00:38:44.816
lt took more than one person
to pull off this scam.

424
00:38:45.064 --> 00:38:46.736
lsn't that right, Jack?

425
00:38:50.424 --> 00:38:54.258
lt would take someone pretty strong
to hoist Mr. McKnight around.

426
00:38:54.584 --> 00:38:58.338
You should have been making pot roast
instead of cooking up trouble!

427
00:38:58.584 --> 00:39:01.701
-That goes for all of you!
-All of you?

428
00:39:02.424 --> 00:39:06.463
Sure, there had to be more people
involved to make this hoax work.

429
00:39:06.744 --> 00:39:10.259
But l, for one,
am totally shocked by this deception.

430
00:39:10.384 --> 00:39:12.818
You can stop the charade now, Mayor.

431
00:39:12.904 --> 00:39:16.260
Because you're the one who made me
suspicious from the beginning.

432
00:39:17.824 --> 00:39:20.133
l am very disappointed in you, Mayor.

433
00:39:20.504 --> 00:39:21.573
And all of you.

434
00:39:21.984 --> 00:39:26.216
For lining your pockets by dragging
Sarah Ravencroft's name through the mud.

435
00:39:35.064 --> 00:39:36.702
So she was a real Wiccan?

436
00:39:36.864 --> 00:39:39.503
-That's right.
-So cool.

437
00:39:39.944 --> 00:39:42.174
She's beautiful.

438
00:39:42.304 --> 00:39:44.579
Yes, l think so, too.

439
00:39:44.944 --> 00:39:48.095
That's why l get upset
when people accuse her of being a witch.

440
00:39:49.224 --> 00:39:53.536
l think l owe you girls an apology
for thinking you were.. ..

441
00:39:53.744 --> 00:39:54.733
Witches.

442
00:39:54.824 --> 00:39:57.975
We saw you perform
some kind of ritual in your shed.

443
00:39:58.184 --> 00:40:02.336
Witches? We just pretend that stuff.
lt's just a gimmick for our band.

444
00:40:02.944 --> 00:40:05.742
We're Eco-Goths. Kind of like Wiccans.

445
00:40:06.224 --> 00:40:07.737
Just ask Thorn. She is one.

446
00:40:08.944 --> 00:40:13.062
Yeah, right. Sally McKnight,
one-sixteenth blood on my mother's side.

447
00:40:13.424 --> 00:40:17.576
That ritual you saw was just peppermint
and cloves to soothe my vocal cords.

448
00:40:17.664 --> 00:40:19.700
You think it's easy singing this stuff?

449
00:40:19.904 --> 00:40:24.375
Thorn's herbal vapor is awesome.
We all use it before and after every show.

450
00:40:24.744 --> 00:40:26.336
What about your fangs?

451
00:40:26.544 --> 00:40:27.738
My dad's a dentist.

452
00:40:28.944 --> 00:40:30.457
He outfitted the band.

453
00:40:34.664 --> 00:40:38.100
We knew it all along, right, Scoob?

454
00:40:39.584 --> 00:40:40.573
Yikes!

455
00:40:48.744 --> 00:40:49.779
Mayor?

456
00:40:50.104 --> 00:40:53.335
We've been ringing your door bell
for some time and.. ..

457
00:40:53.424 --> 00:40:56.734
Sorry about that. l've been meaning
to fix that thing for years.

458
00:40:56.864 --> 00:40:58.058
What's up, Mayor?

459
00:40:58.944 --> 00:41:02.141
l feel real bad about everything,
and l wanted to apologize.. .

460
00:41:02.264 --> 00:41:05.574
for using your ancestor
in our little publicity stunt.

461
00:41:05.744 --> 00:41:08.975
The tourist trade was so slow
we were desperate.

462
00:41:09.224 --> 00:41:13.854
And you once told me that supernatural
phenomena always attracts people.

463
00:41:13.984 --> 00:41:16.737
lt was just natural to use Sarah because.. .

464
00:41:17.344 --> 00:41:19.539
we accidentally dug up her grave.

465
00:41:19.824 --> 00:41:20.973
What grave?

466
00:41:21.144 --> 00:41:22.543
l'm sorry, Ben.. .

467
00:41:22.744 --> 00:41:26.259
but l lied to you when you asked me
if we found anything of Sarah's.. .

468
00:41:26.344 --> 00:41:28.619
while building the Puritan Village.

469
00:41:28.744 --> 00:41:31.781
We did. lt was her grave marker.

470
00:41:31.864 --> 00:41:34.537
We found it in a bulldozed pile
of dirt and rocks.

471
00:41:35.064 --> 00:41:39.182
-We didn't want to upset you.
-But that's all we found. No bones.

472
00:41:39.784 --> 00:41:41.103
No book?

473
00:41:41.264 --> 00:41:44.813
Nothing but that grave marker.
We swear, Ben.

474
00:41:44.984 --> 00:41:47.339
We don't even know where her grave is.

475
00:41:47.464 --> 00:41:50.183
lt's true. lt could be anywhere
between Miller's Creek.. .

476
00:41:50.264 --> 00:41:51.697
and the big tree stump.

477
00:41:58.064 --> 00:42:01.739
Shaggy, do you still have that
little shoe buckle Scooby found today?

478
00:42:02.304 --> 00:42:04.420
Like, this one? Here.

479
00:42:11.704 --> 00:42:14.582
Scooby, can you show me
exactly where you found this?

480
00:42:14.664 --> 00:42:15.813
l think so!

481
00:42:32.144 --> 00:42:36.217
All these years, l was searching
around the wrong oak tree.

482
00:42:36.304 --> 00:42:37.373
Right.

483
00:42:37.464 --> 00:42:41.139
l believe this is what's left of the tree
where Sarah did her healing.

484
00:42:41.544 --> 00:42:45.457
You never even noticed it, because
it was cut down hundreds of years ago.

485
00:42:46.704 --> 00:42:48.774
You've got to dig deeper, Scooby.

486
00:42:49.904 --> 00:42:52.054
How about for a Scooby Snack?

487
00:42:54.184 --> 00:42:55.253
No way.

488
00:42:55.824 --> 00:42:57.303
Two Scooby Snax?

489
00:42:58.784 --> 00:42:59.853
Okay!

490
00:43:16.184 --> 00:43:18.175
-What did you find?
-''Rox! ''

491
00:43:18.424 --> 00:43:19.413
Rocks?

492
00:43:21.784 --> 00:43:22.534
A box!

493
00:43:28.584 --> 00:43:32.657
-Ben, are you okay?
-Just a little excited.

494
00:43:38.424 --> 00:43:41.814
Looks kind of evil
to belong to a Wiccan healer.

495
00:43:44.384 --> 00:43:47.660
Ben, that doesn't seem to be
a journal at all.

496
00:43:48.304 --> 00:43:52.013
Because it isn't, Velma. lt's a spell book!

497
00:43:53.624 --> 00:43:56.343
You see, Sarah wasn't a Wiccan.

498
00:43:56.664 --> 00:43:59.462
She was, indeed, a witch!

499
00:44:01.944 --> 00:44:04.697
-A real witch?
-Heavy.

500
00:44:05.104 --> 00:44:09.495
And since Sarah's blood runs in my veins.. .

501
00:44:09.704 --> 00:44:13.492
l guess that makes me a warlock!

502
00:44:14.104 --> 00:44:15.378
Warlock?

503
00:44:15.544 --> 00:44:19.139
The Wiccans imprisoned Sarah
in her own spell book.. .

504
00:44:19.384 --> 00:44:22.376
and you helped me find it.

505
00:44:22.784 --> 00:44:24.342
You lied to me, Ben.

506
00:44:24.664 --> 00:44:28.543
Well, gee, l had to.
l'd been searching for years.

507
00:44:28.864 --> 00:44:31.332
Then l read about your exploits.

508
00:44:32.864 --> 00:44:35.662
<i>l knew</i> i<i>f anyone could help me</i>
<i>f</i>i<i>nd the book...</i>

509
00:44:35.744 --> 00:44:38.019
i<i>t was you and your fr</i>i<i>ends.</i>

510
00:44:38.264 --> 00:44:41.256
<i>l orchestrated</i>
<i>the whole mummy scheme...</i>

511
00:44:41.344 --> 00:44:44.734
<i>pay</i>i<i>ng off the archaeolog</i>i<i>sts</i>
<i>and the secur</i>i<i>ty guards...</i>

512
00:44:44.824 --> 00:44:48.897
<i>just to lure you to the museum,</i>
<i>so we could meet.</i>

513
00:44:52.344 --> 00:44:56.257
l tricked you into helping me,
and it worked.

514
00:44:56.784 --> 00:44:59.093
And you were in on Ben's plan, too.

515
00:44:59.624 --> 00:45:02.457
No. We're as surprised as you are. Honest.

516
00:45:02.624 --> 00:45:04.296
For once he's telling the truth.

517
00:45:04.384 --> 00:45:07.740
That stupid fake ghost
was the town's idea.

518
00:45:08.024 --> 00:45:10.743
But it did work to my advantage.

519
00:45:11.024 --> 00:45:15.302
Why go through this elaborate scheme?
Why not just ask us to find the book?

520
00:45:15.584 --> 00:45:16.573
l know why.

521
00:45:16.664 --> 00:45:20.213
Because if we knew what that book was,
we would never have helped him.

522
00:45:20.584 --> 00:45:24.099
But even you can't imagine
the real power of this book.

523
00:45:24.464 --> 00:45:26.932
No mere mortal can.

524
00:45:27.424 --> 00:45:30.700
You've been reading too many
of your own horror stories, Ravencroft.

525
00:45:30.784 --> 00:45:33.173
A typical mortal response.

526
00:45:33.424 --> 00:45:36.780
But l am descended from a superior breed.

527
00:45:37.384 --> 00:45:42.333
l shall unlock the power
of the imprisoned Sarah Ravencroft!

528
00:45:43.144 --> 00:45:46.454
-l don't like the sound of this!
-Me either!

529
00:45:46.704 --> 00:45:49.616
Together we shall reign supreme.

530
00:45:50.344 --> 00:45:53.336
''Let the evil from the past

531
00:45:53.984 --> 00:45:56.896
''Breathe again with fiery blast

532
00:46:03.864 --> 00:46:07.174
''Let the dark wind whip the night

533
00:46:07.944 --> 00:46:11.061
''To blow away the force of light''

534
00:46:11.464 --> 00:46:15.252
l know what comes next, buddy.
Big trouble!

535
00:46:18.304 --> 00:46:21.933
''Now l summon ancient power''

536
00:46:25.984 --> 00:46:28.179
Ben, please stop!

537
00:46:29.384 --> 00:46:33.935
''This is evil's finest hour''

538
00:46:41.664 --> 00:46:43.461
What's the matter, Velma?

539
00:46:43.624 --> 00:46:46.696
Don't you like the new,
improved Ben Ravencroft?

540
00:46:47.024 --> 00:46:48.901
No. Frankly, l don't.

541
00:46:49.264 --> 00:46:51.903
Well, get used to it.

542
00:46:54.584 --> 00:46:56.381
Leaving so soon?

543
00:46:58.384 --> 00:47:00.420
The party's just beginning!

544
00:47:03.624 --> 00:47:04.773
Help!

545
00:47:05.064 --> 00:47:06.702
Let us out!

546
00:47:07.024 --> 00:47:08.139
Daddy!

547
00:47:08.984 --> 00:47:11.214
How deeply moving!

548
00:47:19.464 --> 00:47:22.183
Can l spin a yarn, or what?

549
00:47:22.304 --> 00:47:24.772
How could l have ever liked your novels?

550
00:47:24.944 --> 00:47:27.538
Now, guys! Grab the book!

551
00:47:32.304 --> 00:47:34.181
-Where'd he go?
-l don't know.

552
00:47:40.424 --> 00:47:44.463
This isn't one of your silly little mysteries.

553
00:47:44.784 --> 00:47:48.663
You can't solve me so easily.

554
00:47:58.904 --> 00:48:01.816
You won't get away with this,
Ben Ravencroft!

555
00:48:02.144 --> 00:48:05.739
Why? Because of you meddling kids?

556
00:48:06.104 --> 00:48:07.822
Hey, we're not kids.

557
00:48:08.024 --> 00:48:10.174
But enough of this minor magic.

558
00:48:10.744 --> 00:48:14.942
l want to see how powerful l can really be.

559
00:48:15.144 --> 00:48:18.659
lt's time to summon Sarah Ravencroft!

560
00:48:19.464 --> 00:48:22.854
''Dreadful darkness, hear my cry

561
00:48:23.104 --> 00:48:26.221
''Bring back one who cannot die''

562
00:48:32.104 --> 00:48:34.220
Are we ever glad to see you!

563
00:48:37.944 --> 00:48:39.218
Nice going, guys!

564
00:48:39.384 --> 00:48:42.296
We're going, all right.
Away from Witchville!

565
00:48:50.864 --> 00:48:55.494
-We've got to go back for the book.
-Can't we wait for the movie?

566
00:49:01.984 --> 00:49:03.656
You're the man, Scoob!

567
00:49:18.024 --> 00:49:19.855
Not the gift shop!

568
00:49:33.024 --> 00:49:35.743
l'm starting to get the hang of this.

569
00:49:55.784 --> 00:49:58.856
Well, at least we still have one tire.

570
00:50:03.784 --> 00:50:04.899
l'll take that.

571
00:50:08.824 --> 00:50:11.463
Now, where was l?

572
00:50:12.504 --> 00:50:16.213
''Dreadful darkness, hear my cry

573
00:50:16.584 --> 00:50:20.020
''Bring back one who cannot die

574
00:50:20.344 --> 00:50:22.812
''Let the witch who perished here

575
00:50:23.424 --> 00:50:26.302
''Live again and reappear! ''

576
00:50:59.624 --> 00:51:01.694
ln my wildest dreams.. .

577
00:51:02.064 --> 00:51:06.103
l could never have imagined
such an imposing creature.

578
00:51:06.784 --> 00:51:11.221
Thank thee. Thou canst not know
what my bondage hath been like.

579
00:51:11.744 --> 00:51:12.859
Who art thou?

580
00:51:13.024 --> 00:51:16.539
Ben Ravencroft. Your descendent.. .

581
00:51:16.624 --> 00:51:18.137
from the modern world.

582
00:51:18.344 --> 00:51:19.333
Modern?

583
00:51:20.584 --> 00:51:22.939
Not much seems to have changed.

584
00:51:23.864 --> 00:51:25.695
Please don't hurt us!

585
00:51:26.384 --> 00:51:31.253
The same pathetic peasants
groveling for their puny lives.

586
00:51:33.184 --> 00:51:36.972
Sarah, l want to become more powerful.

587
00:51:37.384 --> 00:51:38.578
Like you.

588
00:51:41.544 --> 00:51:42.897
Thou jest.

589
00:51:43.384 --> 00:51:45.579
But it was l who released you.

590
00:51:45.664 --> 00:51:47.655
You should serve me.

591
00:51:48.304 --> 00:51:50.056
l serve no one!

592
00:51:50.744 --> 00:51:53.577
Leastwise a worm like thee.

593
00:51:53.984 --> 00:51:56.782
Aye, thou hast freed me.. .

594
00:51:56.864 --> 00:52:00.334
so l can punish the world
for my long imprisonment.

595
00:52:11.624 --> 00:52:15.412
l shall create an era of darkness
over this land.

596
00:52:19.224 --> 00:52:21.101
We're goners, Scoob.

597
00:52:31.304 --> 00:52:33.135
This isn't what l envisioned.

598
00:52:33.344 --> 00:52:37.178
We were supposed
to rule the world together. Not destroy it.

599
00:52:37.504 --> 00:52:40.098
l care not for thy whims.

600
00:52:40.304 --> 00:52:44.582
Cross my path and l shall destroy thee
along with thy world.

601
00:52:45.024 --> 00:52:47.140
But l have the book!

602
00:52:47.704 --> 00:52:51.379
And l will return you back into the book.

603
00:52:52.424 --> 00:52:54.335
''Ancient evil get thee hence

604
00:52:54.904 --> 00:52:58.419
''Only good can recompense
All that's good--''

605
00:53:01.944 --> 00:53:03.775
Thinkest thou art a Wiccan?

606
00:53:04.184 --> 00:53:07.176
Only a virtuous soul can imprison me.

607
00:53:13.344 --> 00:53:14.857
Let me out!

608
00:53:15.984 --> 00:53:17.576
l've got an idea, guys.

609
00:53:17.664 --> 00:53:19.336
But we still need that book.

610
00:53:20.304 --> 00:53:21.862
Not again.

611
00:53:21.984 --> 00:53:24.544
l'm sorry, guys,
but you two are the fastest.

612
00:53:25.024 --> 00:53:26.662
No way!

613
00:53:27.984 --> 00:53:30.339
Don't worry.
We'll create a diversion for you.

614
00:53:30.704 --> 00:53:32.103
No way!

615
00:53:32.184 --> 00:53:34.618
How about for a whole box
of Scooby Snax?

616
00:53:35.064 --> 00:53:36.702
-A whole box?
-A whole box?

617
00:53:39.344 --> 00:53:40.459
Good luck.

618
00:53:42.184 --> 00:53:44.778
Hey, broom rider! Over here!

619
00:53:45.424 --> 00:53:48.461
Thou shalt pay for thine impudence!

620
00:53:53.784 --> 00:53:55.536
l guess snack time's over!

621
00:53:58.904 --> 00:54:02.021
Four hundred years
hasn't helped your aim, lady!

622
00:54:03.584 --> 00:54:06.496
Thy mockery shall be thy last!

623
00:54:36.064 --> 00:54:38.578
No! Let me out!

624
00:54:40.984 --> 00:54:43.452
This is almost too easy!

625
00:54:44.464 --> 00:54:46.216
The book cannot help thee!

626
00:54:49.704 --> 00:54:52.821
Do my bidding, bird! Get them !

627
00:54:53.464 --> 00:54:57.377
A turkey? Even we're not scared of that!

628
00:54:58.944 --> 00:55:00.741
Now we are!

629
00:55:16.224 --> 00:55:17.418
Daphne!

630
00:55:19.024 --> 00:55:20.139
Don't worry!

631
00:55:23.664 --> 00:55:24.653
Help!

632
00:55:24.744 --> 00:55:25.733
Jinkies!

633
00:55:58.304 --> 00:56:01.740
l believe thou hast something
that is mine!

634
00:56:14.464 --> 00:56:17.342
-Got the stuffing, Scoob?
-Yeah!

635
00:56:17.424 --> 00:56:19.938
Time to baste this bird!

636
00:56:23.424 --> 00:56:26.655
l guess he didn't have the right stuff,
old buddy!

637
00:56:38.104 --> 00:56:40.015
Wait for me, Scoob!

638
00:56:46.544 --> 00:56:47.579
Hurry!

639
00:56:48.224 --> 00:56:53.059
-Thanks! l'm out of here!
-Yeah, that witch is the real thing.

640
00:56:53.144 --> 00:56:57.137
-Wait, Thorn. We need your help.
-Me? What can l do?

641
00:56:57.304 --> 00:57:00.819
We need you to read that spell
to defeat Sarah Ravencroft.

642
00:57:00.984 --> 00:57:03.214
Are you crazy? l told you.. .

643
00:57:03.464 --> 00:57:06.615
l'm not really a witch.
l can't help you against her!

644
00:57:06.704 --> 00:57:08.899
But you said you were part Wiccan, right?

645
00:57:09.024 --> 00:57:10.298
Only one-sixteenth.

646
00:57:10.704 --> 00:57:13.093
lt doesn't matter.
You still have Wiccan blood.

647
00:57:13.184 --> 00:57:16.859
Which means only you can read the spell
that will send Sarah Ravencroft.. .

648
00:57:16.944 --> 00:57:18.457
back where she came from.

649
00:57:18.544 --> 00:57:21.263
Forget it. You don't even have the book.

650
00:57:21.424 --> 00:57:23.380
No, Scooby does.

651
00:57:26.784 --> 00:57:28.456
Scooby! Over here!

652
00:57:32.104 --> 00:57:34.664
Give me my book, meddling hound!

653
00:57:34.864 --> 00:57:36.456
Hound? Where?

654
00:57:40.104 --> 00:57:42.493
Let my buddy go, you creepy crone!

655
00:57:45.664 --> 00:57:47.461
What was that?

656
00:57:47.624 --> 00:57:49.182
You're not melting.

657
00:57:49.424 --> 00:57:51.733
lt worked in <i>The W</i>i<i>zard of Oz</i>!

658
00:57:52.584 --> 00:57:55.781
Fool! l shall destroy thee!

659
00:58:07.304 --> 00:58:09.101
The book!

660
00:58:12.304 --> 00:58:13.896
l'll hold that for you.

661
00:58:25.184 --> 00:58:27.175
Bring me the book!

662
00:58:32.944 --> 00:58:34.013
Scoob!

663
00:58:37.184 --> 00:58:38.458
Enough!

664
00:58:45.024 --> 00:58:46.013
Yikes!

665
00:59:05.384 --> 00:59:07.773
Here's the spell. lt's up to you, Thorn.

666
00:59:11.184 --> 00:59:14.813
The book is useless to a mere mortal.

667
00:59:16.024 --> 00:59:17.855
But not to a Wiccan.

668
00:59:18.464 --> 00:59:21.422
Nay! l'll stop thee myself!

669
00:59:22.864 --> 00:59:24.092
Hurry, Thorn! Read!

670
00:59:24.544 --> 00:59:26.739
''Ancient evil get thee hence

671
00:59:26.864 --> 00:59:30.334
''Only good can recompense
For the misdeeds that you've done

672
00:59:30.424 --> 00:59:32.858
''Witch, return from whence you've come! ''

673
00:59:46.704 --> 00:59:48.057
Thorn! lt's working!

674
01:00:04.544 --> 01:00:06.057
Not again!

675
01:00:16.384 --> 01:00:19.820
l won't go back alone!

676
01:00:38.304 --> 01:00:43.059
Ben Ravencroft's last book
is one the world will never buy.

677
01:00:43.344 --> 01:00:44.413
Thank goodness.

678
01:00:44.824 --> 01:00:47.736
lt would have been a hot best-seller.

679
01:00:54.024 --> 01:00:55.173
Daddy!

680
01:00:56.824 --> 01:00:59.782
-Are you okay?
-You're the one l was worried about.

681
01:01:00.144 --> 01:01:03.102
But you did it.
l guess you are a witch after all.

682
01:01:03.344 --> 01:01:05.619
A Wiccan, Daddy, a Wiccan.

683
01:01:09.544 --> 01:01:13.617
This is a disaster! No witch, no village.

684
01:01:13.744 --> 01:01:16.019
What are we gonna do
for our Autumn Fest?

685
01:01:16.704 --> 01:01:19.537
Well, you still have the Hex Girls.

686
01:01:20.984 --> 01:01:24.659
No offense, girls,
but l think we need a bigger attraction.

687
01:01:25.624 --> 01:01:27.262
