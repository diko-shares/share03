180

These are from an old Southern recipe
handed down to me by my father.

at these,

but to sample your beans.

-Be my guest.
-Thank you.

Am I to understand
that your secret ingredient is alcohol?

191
00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:15.029
Whisky. Tennessee whisky, Spock.
You care for a little snort?

192

353
00:29:14.962 --> 00:29:15.963
Come in.

00:29:16.046 --> 00:29:17.839
-KIRK: Bob?
-Jim!

355
00:29:19.007 --> 00:29:21.677
Well! We’re dressing informally,
aren ’t we ?

356
00:29:22.803 --> 00:29:24.596
You caught me on the way
to the shower.

357
00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.598
I apologise for cancelling shore leave,

358
00:29:26.682 --> 00:29:31.353
but look, we have a dangerous situation
out on Nimbus III.

359
00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:35.274
-On the planet of galactic peace?
-The same.

360
00:29:35.524 --> 00:29:36.692
From what we can make out,

361
00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:39.987
a terrorist force
has captured the only settlement.

362
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:43.115
And they've taken hostages.
The Klingon, the Romulan,

363
00:29:43.198 --> 00:29:44.700
the Federation consuls.

364
00:29:44.783 --> 00:29:48.203
Now, I know Enterprise is not exactly
up to specs...

365
00:29:49.246 --> 00:29:52.332
With all due respect,
the Enterprise is a disaster.

366
00:29:52.416 --> 00:29:53.792
There must be other ships
in the quadrant.

367
00:29:53.875 --> 00:29:57.129
Other ships, yes.
But no experienced commanders.

368
00:29:57.212 --> 00:29:59.798
Captain, I need Jim Kirk.

369
00:29:59.881 --> 00:30:01.466
-Oh, please.
-Your orders are

370
00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:04.386
to proceed to Nimbus III,
assess the situation,

371
00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.639
and avoid a confrontation if possible.

372
00:30:07.723 --> 00:30:11.143
Above all, however,
get those hostages back safely.

373
00:30:11.643 --> 00:30:13.395
Have the Klingons responded?

374
00:30:13.478 --> 00:30:14.980
No, but you can bet they will.

375
00:30:15.063 --> 00:30:16.773
Understood. Kirk out.

376
00:30:17.399 --> 00:30:19.151

379
00:30:23.363 --> 00:30:26.950
I'm afraid the ship's problems
will have to be solved en route.

380
00:30:27.034 --> 00:30:30.370
Since we're undermanned, I'm counting
on each one of you to give his best.

381
00:30:30.454 --> 00:30:32.456
End of speech. Let's go to work.

382
00:30:32.539 --> 00:30:36.835
Jim, if you ask me, and you haven't,

383
00:30:37.169 --> 00:30:41.048
I think this is a terrible idea.
We're bound to bump into the Klingons,

384
00:30:41.131 --> 00:30:43.508
and they don't exactly like you.

385
00:30:43.592 --> 00:30:45.427

388
00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:53.685
Don't you worry, Captain.
We'll beat those Klingon devils

389
00:30:54.019 --> 00:30:55.312
even ifl have to get out and push.

390
00:30:55.771 --> 00:30:58.273
I hope it won't come to that, Mr Scott.

391
00:30:58.732 --> 00:31:00.150

-Not General Korrd.
-The same.

414
00:32:24.317 --> 00:32:27.446
He's apparently fallen out of favour
with the Klingon High Command.

415
00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:30.115
KIRK: General Korrd's military strategies
were required learning

416
00:32:30.198 --> 00:32:32.409
when I was a cadet at the Academy.

417
00:32:33.452 --> 00:32:37.456
When they put me out to pasture,
I hope I fare better than Korrd.

418
00:32:40.083 --> 00:32:42.252
This must be the hostage tape.

419
00:32:43.211 --> 00:32:46.465
A short time ago,
we willingly surrendered ourselves

420
00:32:46.548 --> 00:32:49.426
to the forces
of the Galactic Army of Light.

421
00:32:50.594 --> 00:32:52.971
At this moment,
we ’re in their protective custody.

422
00:32:53.054 --> 00:32:55.265
Their leader assures us
that we will be treated humanely

423
00:32:55.348 --> 00:32:58.018
so long as you cooperate
with his demands.

424
00:32:58.101 --> 00:33:02.439
I believe his sincerity. He requests
that you send a Federation starship

425
00:33:02.522 --> 00:33:04.941
to parley for our release at once.

426
00:33:05.358 --> 00:33:07.402
Be assured that we are in good health,

427
00:33:07.486 --> 00:33:09.988

your immediate response.

428
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:17.204
I deeply regret this desperate act,
but these are desperate times.

429
00:33:17.287 --> 00:33:18.997
I have no desire
to harm these innocents,

430
00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.917
but do not put me to the test.
I implore you...

431
00:33:22.959 --> 00:33:26.546
I implore you to respond immediately.

432
00:33:40.769 --> 00:33:42.103
What is it?

433
00:33:43.438 --> 00:33:47.484
-You look like you've just seen a ghost.
-Perhaps I have, Captain.

434
00:33:47.734 --> 00:33:49.152
Perhaps I have.

00:34:17.973 --> 00:34:21.184
-Do you know this Vulcan?
-I cannot be certain.

437
00:34:21.768 --> 00:34:23.186
But he does seem familiar.

438
00:34:23.478 --> 00:34:26.356
He reminds me of someone
I knew in my youth.

439
00:34:26.815 --> 00:34:29.317
Why, Spock, I didn't know you had one.

440
00:34:29.401 --> 00:34:31.361
I do not often think of the past.

441
00:34:32.821 --> 00:34:34.281
Who is it he reminds you of?

442
00:34:34.364 --> 00:34:38.201
There was a young student,
exceptionally gifted,

443
00:34:39.244 --> 00:34:42.622
possessing a great intelligence.

444
00:34:44.124 --> 00:34:47.168
It was assumed that one day
he would take his place

445
00:34:47.252 --> 00:34:49.963
amongst the great scholars of Vulcan.

446
00:34:50.463 --> 00:34:53.508
-But he was a revolutionary.
-What do you mean?

447
00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:56.052
The knowledge and experience
he sought

448
00:34:56.136 --> 00:34:58.763
were forbidden by Vulcan belief.

449
00:34:58.847 --> 00:35:03.018
-Forbidden?
-He rejected his logical upbringing

450
00:35:03.893 --> 00:35:06.980
and embraced the animal passions
of our ancestors.

451
00:35:07.063 --> 00:35:08.148
Why?

452
00:35:09.858 --> 00:35:15.113
He believed the key to self-knowledge
was emotion, not logic.

453
00:35:16.281 --> 00:35:18.658
Imagine that. A passionate Vulcan.

454
00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:21.661
When he encouraged others
to follow him,

455
00:35:21.745 --> 00:35:24.706
he was banished from Vulcan,
never to return.

456
00:35:26.207 --> 00:35:27.417

00:54:46.533 --> 00:54:50.078
-I ordered you to defend your ship.
-You ordered me to kill my brother.

697
00:54:50.162 --> 00:54:52.039
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan,
but that doesn't...

698
00:54:52.122 --> 00:54:54.166
No, no, no, Captain.
You do not understand.

699
00:54:54.249 --> 00:54:57.419
Sybok also is a son of Sarek.

700
00:54:57.503 --> 00:55:00.130
You mean he's your "brother" brother?

701
00:55:01.089 --> 00:55:03.300
-You made that up.
-I did not.

702
00:55:03.383 --> 00:55:05.302
You did, too.
Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother

703
00:55:05.385 --> 00:55:07.638
because I happen to know for a fact
you don't have a brother.

704
00:55:07.721 --> 00:55:10.557
Technically you are correct.
I do not have a brother.

705
00:55:10.641 --> 00:55:13.477
-There, you see? See?
-I have a half-brother.

706
00:55:15.604 --> 00:55:17.231
I gotta sit down.

707
00:55:19.733 --> 00:55:21.109
MCCOY: Let me get this straight.

708
00:55:21.193 --> 00:55:23.946
You and Sybok have the same father
but different mothers.

709
00:55:24.029 --> 00:55:27.991
Exactly. That is correct.
Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess.

710
00:55:28.075 --> 00:55:31.411
Upon her death,
Sybok and I were raised as brothers.

711
00:55:32.371 --> 00:55:34.248
Why didn't you tell us this before?

712
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:38.126
I was not disposed to discuss matters
of a personal nature.

713
00:55:38.502 --> 00:55:40.087
For that, I am sorry.

714
00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:42.506
He's sorry. See? He's sorry.
That makes everything all right.

715
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:44.758
-He's sorry. Everything...
-Stop it, Jim!

716
00:55:44.842 --> 00:55:47.678
Spock could no more kill
his own brother than he could kill you.

717
00:55:47.761 --> 00:55:49.012
If you want to punish him
for what he's done,

718
00:55:49.096 --> 00:55:50.889
why don't you throw him in the brig?

719
00:55:50.973 --> 00:55:53.684
Besides, we've got
bigger problems to deal with.

720
00:55:53.767 --> 00:55:56.228
Like how the hell to get out of here.

721
00:55:56.895 --> 00:55:58.522
I'll say one thing, Spock.

722
00:55:58.605 --> 00:56:01.817
-You never cease to amaze me.
-Nor I myself.

723
00:56:09.533 --> 00:56:11.952
I was beginning to worry.
Where is the captain?

724
00:56:12.035 --> 00:56:15.414
It's all right, Pavel.
Sybok will explain everything.

725
00:56:17.082 --> 00:56:20.377
-Sulu, what are you doing?
-Plotting our new course.

726
00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:22.754
New course? You have no authority.

727
00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:28.135

728
00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:29.386
-Pavel...
-I won't force you.

729
00:56:29.469 --> 00:56:32.598
-...you've got to listen to this man.
-The decision must be yours.

730
00:56:32.681 --> 00:56:35.976
-I don't understand.
-Each of us hides a secret pain.

731

and gain strength from the sharing.

-He did, Jim.

737

There's got to be a way
out of this place.

738
00:57:21.855 --> 00:57:24.524
This is a new brig, Captain.
It is escape-proof.

739
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:28.195
-How do you know?
-The designers tested it

740
00:57:28.278 --> 00:57:32.366
using the most intelligent
and resourceful person they could find.

741
00:57:32.699 --> 00:57:34.284
He failed to escape.

742
00:57:34.368 --> 00:57:37.621
This person didn't by any chance
have pointed ears

743
00:57:37.704 --> 00:57:42.250
and an unerring capacity for getting
his shipmates into trouble, did he?

744
00:57:45.462 --> 00:57:47.589
He did have pointed ears.

745
00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:54.596

Now that we're under way,

748
00:58:02.187 --> 00:58:05.399
it's time I announced my intentions
to the rest of the ship.

749
00:58:06.525 --> 00:58:09.111
SYBOK ON PA: Brave crew
of the Starship Enterprise,

750
00:58:10.278 --> 00:58:12.739
consider the questions of existence.

751
00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:15.534
These are the questions
which man has asked

752
00:58:15.617 --> 00:58:19.746
ever since he first gazed at the stars
and dreamed.

753
00:58:20.205 --> 00:58:24.334
My Vulcan ancestors were ruled
by their emotions.

754
00:58:24.418 --> 00:58:29.589
They felt with their hearts.
They made love with their hearts.

755
00:58:30.465 --> 00:58:32.801
They believed with their hearts.

756
00:58:32.884 --> 00:58:35.679
But above all else,
they believed in a place

757
00:58:35.762 --> 00:58:39.474
in which these questions of existence
would be answered.

758
00:58:41.184 --> 00:58:43.895
Modern dogma tells us
this place is a myth,

759
00:58:44.896 --> 00:58:48.525
a fantasy concocted by pagans.

760
00:58:49.609 --> 00:58:52.112
It is no fantasy, I tell you.

761
00:58:53.739 --> 00:58:54.990
I tell you

762
00:58:56.616 --> 00:58:57.993

764
00:59:02.622 --> 00:59:06.793
to undertake
the greatest adventure of all time.

765

The discovery of Sha'Ka'Ree.

766
00:59:12.966 --> 00:59:14.885
-Is it possible?
-KIRK: Is what possible?

767
00:59:14.968 --> 00:59:19.389
That he's found Sha'Ka'Ree.
The reason Sybok left Vulcan.

768
00:59:19.681 --> 00:59:23.060
Our destination
is the planet Sha'Ka'Ree,

769
00:59:24.394 --> 00:59:27.564
which lies beyond the Great Barrier

770
00:59:27.981 --> 00:59:29.983
at the centre of the galaxy.

771
00:59:31.151 --> 00:59:34.988
-The centre of the galaxy?
-Where Sha'Ka'Ree is fabled to exist.

772
00:59:35.781 --> 00:59:37.991
But the centre of the galaxy
can't be reached.

into the Great Barrier.

I have ever known.

776

Spock, my only concern
is getting the ship back.

777
00:59:47.417 --> 00:59:49.294
When that's done and Sybok is in here,

778
00:59:49.377 --> 00:59:53.173
then you can debate Sha'Ka'Ree
until you're green in the face.

or you're not.
