400
00:30:37.181 --> 00:30:38.807
I think this is a terrible idea.

401

Do you know this Vulcan?

456
00:34:19.571 --> 00:34:21.072
I cannot be certain.

457
00:34:21.948 --> 00:34:23.408
But he does seem familiar.

458

459
00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.289
Why, Spock, I didn't
know you had one.

460
00:34:29.581 --> 00:34:31.625
I do not often
think of the past.

461
00:34:32.834 --> 00:34:34.461
Who is it he reminds you of?

462
00:34:34.544 --> 00:34:38.090
There was a young student,
exceptionally gifted,

463
00:34:39.299 --> 00:34:42.886
possessing a great intelligence.

464
00:34:44.304 --> 00:34:47.391
It was assumed that one
day he would take his place

amongst the great
scholars of Vulcan.

466
00:34:50.435 --> 00:34:52.062
But he was a revolutionary.

467
00:34:52.688 --> 00:34:53.855
What do you mean?

468
00:34:53.939 --> 00:34:56.483
The knowledge and
experience he sought

469
00:34:56.566 --> 00:34:58.402
were forbidden by Vulcan belief.

470
00:34:58.902 --> 00:35:00.028
Forbidden?

471
00:35:00.112 --> 00:35:03.240
He rejected
his logical upbringing

472
00:35:03.949 --> 00:35:06.660
and embraced the animal
passions of our ancestors.

473
00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.287
Why?

474
00:35:09.788 --> 00:35:15.377
He believed the key to
self-knowledge was emotion, not logic.

475
00:35:16.378 --> 00:35:18.881
Imagine that.
A passionate Vulcan.

476
00:35:19.923 --> 00:35:21.717
When he encouraged others
to follow him,

477
00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:24.928
he was banished from
Vulcan, never to return.

478
00:35:26.263 --> 00:35:27.514

Even if we could
lock on to the hostages,

497
00:36:17.898 --> 00:36:19.608
we could not beam them up.

I recommend we land
at coordinates 8-5-6-3.

505

693
00:49:32.823 --> 00:49:33.866
Really.

694
00:49:38.537 --> 00:49:40.456

He's good.

709
00:51:31.442 --> 00:51:33.820
We must change course at once.

710
00:51:39.701 --> 00:51:41.411
I'll take you to the bridge.

(KIRK GRUNTING)

712
00:52:18.573 --> 00:52:20.158
(GRUNTING)
Pick it up.

713
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:28.291
Sybok.

714
00:52:31.586 --> 00:52:33.004
You must surrender.

715
00:52:37.509 --> 00:52:38.551
No.

716
00:52:41.513 --> 00:52:43.265
You must kill me.

717
00:52:43.682 --> 00:52:44.849
Shoot him!

718
00:52:56.862 --> 00:53:01.032
For a moment, I thought
you might actually do it.

719
00:53:07.497 --> 00:53:09.791
Put him in the brig
with Captain Kirk.

720
00:53:14.921 --> 00:53:16.131
Spock.

721
00:53:18.133 --> 00:53:21.011
You will accompany me
to the bridge?

722
00:53:22.095 --> 00:53:23.096
No.

723
00:53:25.474 --> 00:53:26.767
I will not.

724
00:53:29.436 --> 00:53:31.521
You know I'm right.

725
00:53:37.736 --> 00:53:39.279
Then you must join them.

726
00:53:58.257 --> 00:53:59.758
Move. Move!

727
00:54:00.634 --> 00:54:02.970
These two will be useful.

728
00:54:03.053 --> 00:54:04.847
Give us a moment alone.

729
00:54:06.181 --> 00:54:07.391
Don't be afraid.

(HEART BEATING)

731
00:54:25.826 --> 00:54:27.578
Damn it, Spock.
Goddamn it!

732
00:54:27.661 --> 00:54:28.829
Captain, what I have done...

733
00:54:28.912 --> 00:54:30.331
What you have done is
betray every man on this ship.

734
00:54:30.414 --> 00:54:32.333
Worse. I have betrayed you.

735
00:54:32.458 --> 00:54:33.626
I do not expect
you to forgive me.

736
00:54:33.709 --> 00:54:36.170
Forgive you? I ought to knock
you on your goddamn ass.

737
00:54:36.253 --> 00:54:37.546
If you think it would help.

738
00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:38.714
You want me to hold him, Jim?

739
00:54:38.797 --> 00:54:40.174
You stay out of this.

740
00:54:40.591 --> 00:54:43.677
Why, Spock? Why? All you
had to do was pull the trigger.

741
00:54:44.178 --> 00:54:46.305
If I had pulled the trigger,
Sybok would be dead.

742
00:54:46.555 --> 00:54:48.140
I ordered you
to defend your ship.

743
00:54:48.557 --> 00:54:49.975
You ordered me
to kill my brother.

744
00:54:50.392 --> 00:54:52.061
Look, the man may be a
fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...

745
00:54:52.144 --> 00:54:54.188
No, no, no, Captain.
You do not understand.

746
00:54:54.355 --> 00:54:57.358
Sybok also is a son of Sarek.

747
00:54:57.733 --> 00:54:58.984
You mean he's your
"brother" brother?

748
00:55:01.278 --> 00:55:03.072
- You made that up.
- I did not.

749
00:55:03.447 --> 00:55:05.658
You did, too. Sybok couldn't
possibly be your brother,

750
00:55:05.741 --> 00:55:07.910
because I happen to know for
a fact you don't have a brother.

751
00:55:07.993 --> 00:55:10.204
Technically, you are correct.
I do not have a brother.

752
00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:12.289
There, you see?
See?

753
00:55:12.373 --> 00:55:13.541
I have a half-brother.

754
00:55:15.668 --> 00:55:17.044
I gotta sit down.

755
00:55:19.797 --> 00:55:21.173
McCOY: Let me
get this straight.

756
00:55:21.257 --> 00:55:24.051
You and Sybok have the same
father but different mothers.

757
00:55:24.135 --> 00:55:25.636
Exactly. That is correct.

758
00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:27.972
Sybok's mother
was a Vulcan princess.

759
00:55:28.139 --> 00:55:30.808
Upon her death, Sybok
and I were raised as brothers.

760
00:55:32.476 --> 00:55:34.145
Why didn't you tell us
this before?

761
00:55:35.187 --> 00:55:38.065
I was not disposed to discuss
matters of a personal nature.

762
00:55:38.524 --> 00:55:40.318
For that, I am sorry.

763
00:55:40.735 --> 00:55:42.695
He's sorry. See? He's sorry.
That makes everything all right.

764
00:55:42.778 --> 00:55:44.572
- He's sorry. Everything...
- Stop it, Jim!

765
00:55:44.906 --> 00:55:46.324
Spock could no more
kill his own brother

766
00:55:46.407 --> 00:55:47.658
than he could kill you.

767
00:55:47.742 --> 00:55:49.118
If you want to punish him
for what he's done,

768
00:55:49.202 --> 00:55:51.120
why don't you
throw him in the brig?

769
00:55:51.204 --> 00:55:53.498
Besides, we've got bigger
problems to deal with.

770
00:55:53.873 --> 00:55:55.875
Like how the hell
to get out of here.

771
00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:58.878
I'll say one thing, Spock.

772
00:55:58.961 --> 00:56:00.713
You never cease to amaze me.

773
00:56:00.797 --> 00:56:02.048
Nor I myself.

774
00:56:09.806 --> 00:56:11.891
I was beginning to worry.
Where is the captain?

775
00:56:11.974 --> 00:56:13.601
It's all right, Pavel.

776
00:56:13.685 --> 00:56:15.603
Sybok will explain everything.

777
00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:18.439
Sulu, what are you doing?

778
00:56:18.523 --> 00:56:19.857
Plotting our new course.

779
00:56:20.483 --> 00:56:22.694
New course?
You have no authority.

780
00:56:26.406 --> 00:56:28.241
What's going on here?

781
00:56:28.324 --> 00:56:29.659
- Pavel...
- I won't force you.

782
00:56:29.742 --> 00:56:30.827
...you've got to
listen to this man.

783
00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:32.495
The decision must be yours.

784
00:56:32.954 --> 00:56:34.080
I don't understand.

785
00:56:34.163 --> 00:56:36.291
Each of us hides a secret pain.

786
00:56:37.041 --> 00:56:41.629
Share yours with me and
gain strength from the sharing.

788
00:56:47.594 --> 00:56:48.678
Ah!

Ah-ha.

791
00:57:00.065 --> 00:57:01.441
Mm-hmm.

792
00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:08.657
Unwise.

793
00:57:17.749 --> 00:57:19.042
You could've warned me.

794
00:57:19.125 --> 00:57:20.418
He did, Jim.

795
00:57:20.502 --> 00:57:21.836
There's got to be a way
out of this place.

796
00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:24.464
This is a new brig, Captain.
It is escape-proof.

797
00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:27.092
How do you know?

798
00:57:27.175 --> 00:57:28.385
The designers tested it

799
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:32.055
using the most intelligent and
resourceful person they could find.

800
00:57:32.681 --> 00:57:34.432
He failed to escape.

801
00:57:34.516 --> 00:57:37.227
This person didn't by any
chance have pointed ears

802
00:57:37.727 --> 00:57:40.939
and an unerring capacity for getting
his shipmates into trouble, did he?

803
00:57:45.694 --> 00:57:47.529
He did have pointed ears.

804
00:57:52.325 --> 00:57:54.828
Following new course.
Warp 7.

805
00:57:54.911 --> 00:57:58.290
Estimating destination
in 6.7 hours, present speed.

806
00:58:00.751 --> 00:58:02.127
Now that we're under way,

807
00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:05.422
it's time I announced my
intentions to the rest of the ship.

808
00:58:06.631 --> 00:58:09.051
<i>SYBOK ON PA: Brave crew
of the Starship</i> Enterprise,

809
00:58:10.385 --> 00:58:12.721
<i>consider the questions
of existence.</i>

810
00:58:13.388 --> 00:58:15.557
These are the questions
which man has asked

811
00:58:15.641 --> 00:58:19.853
ever since he first gazed
at the stars and dreamed.

812
00:58:20.354 --> 00:58:23.857
<i>My Vulcan ancestors
were ruled by their emotions.</i>

813
00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:26.568
<i>They felt with their hearts.</i>

814
00:58:27.611 --> 00:58:30.072
<i>They made love
with their hearts.</i>

815
00:58:30.781 --> 00:58:32.491
<i>They believed with their hearts.</i>

816
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:35.786
But above all else,
they believed in a place

817
00:58:35.869 --> 00:58:39.498
in which these questions of
existence would be answered.

818
00:58:41.333 --> 00:58:43.836
Modern dogma tells us
this place is a myth,

819
00:58:45.087 --> 00:58:48.465
a fantasy concocted by pagans.

820
00:58:49.717 --> 00:58:52.052
<i>It is no fantasy, I tell you.</i>

821
00:58:53.887 --> 00:58:54.930
<i>I tell you</i>

822
00:58:56.807 --> 00:58:58.350
<i>it exists.</i>

823
00:58:58.517 --> 00:59:01.437
My brothers, we have been chosen

824
00:59:02.896 --> 00:59:06.734
to undertake the greatest
adventure of all time.

825
00:59:08.319 --> 00:59:11.363
The discovery of Sha Ka Ree.

826
00:59:13.073 --> 00:59:14.950
- Is it possible?
- KIRK: Is what possible?

827
00:59:15.034 --> 00:59:16.660
That he's found Sha Ka Ree.

828
00:59:17.036 --> 00:59:18.954
The reason Sybok left Vulcan.

829
00:59:19.830 --> 00:59:23.000
Our destination
is the planet Sha Ka Ree,

830
00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:27.671
which lies beyond
the Great Barrier

831
00:59:27.838 --> 00:59:30.090
<i>at the center of the galaxy.</i>

832
00:59:31.217 --> 00:59:32.593
The center of the galaxy?

833
00:59:32.676 --> 00:59:34.929
Where Sha Ka Ree
is fabled to exist.

834
00:59:36.013 --> 00:59:38.182
But the center of the
galaxy can't be reached.

835
00:59:38.265 --> 00:59:40.017
No ship has ever gone
into the Great Barrier.

836
00:59:40.101 --> 00:59:41.644
No probe has ever returned.

837
00:59:41.727 --> 00:59:44.313
Sybok possessed the keenest
intellect I have ever known.

838
00:59:44.939 --> 00:59:47.024
Spock, my only concern
is getting the ship back.

839
00:59:47.483 --> 00:59:49.527
When that's done
and Sybok is in here,

840
00:59:49.610 --> 00:59:52.113
then you can debate Sha Ka
Ree until you're green in the face.

841
00:59:54.657 --> 00:59:56.534
Until then, you're either
with me or you're not.

842
00:59:57.326 --> 00:59:58.744
I am here, Captain.

843
00:59:59.286 --> 01:00:00.955

What are you
standing around for?

Do you not know a jail break
when you see one?

860
01:00:47.001 --> 01:00:50.088
The bond between these three
is strong, difficult to penetrate.

861
01:00:50.171 --> 01:00:52.006
This will be quite a challenge.

862
01:00:54.175 --> 01:00:55.843
We've got to find them.

863
01:00:56.344 --> 01:00:58.096

trust anyone now.
