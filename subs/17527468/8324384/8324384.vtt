[upbeat rock music playing]

2
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.180
<i>[PJ] Tonight is
the fucking night, okay?</i>

3
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.810
We've looked like shit
for years,
and we are developing.

4
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.770
I would say I'm actually
mostly developed.

5
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.980
We're finally hot.
At least, according to me.

6
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.440
We're getting out there.

7
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.980
We're getting in the cooch,
my girl.

8
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.690
We are getting in the puss
and we're gettin' wet.

9
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.360
Man, speak for yourself.

10
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.490
Nobody's gonna wanna
fuck me this year,

11
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.950
just like nobody wanted
to fuck me last year
or the year before.

12
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.410
Okay, well, I'm gonna talk
to Brittany.

13
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.490
I think that it's time.

14
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.700
Oh, really? It's time?

15
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.950
There wasn't time
in the last 11 years

16
00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.500
we've all been going
to school together?

17
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.790
I've been building tension.

18
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.170
You know,
you could say hi to Isabel.

19
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.290
Yeah, okay.

20
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.790
And just what would I say?

21
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:08.260
Like, "Hey, girl, what's up?
How's your boyfriend?

22
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.090
How's his penis?

23
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.090
Still awesome and big
and throbbing and, uh,
like a male penis?"

24
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.800
They could have broken up,
you never know.

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.600
The fair is like
a completely fresh start.

26
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.270
I'm not doin' that
with Isabel,
you know what I mean?

27
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.520
Like, I'm... I'm...
I'm playin' the long game
with her, okay?

28
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.520
- Mmm.
- Here's how it's gonna
shake out.

29
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.820
I don't speak to the bitch
for years.

30
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.030
Bam! It's the 20th
high school reunion.

31
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.490
I show up,
I'm in a little suit

32
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.570
like the lesbian I am,
you know what I mean?

33
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.780
It's probably white, okay?

34
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.290
She looks at me,
I look back at her.

35
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.370
What the fuck happened to her?

36
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.910
She's washed up.

37
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.880
I mean Jeff has
run her ragged.

38
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.000
That's when my ass
swoops in, okay?

39
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.590
That made me so sad.
What? Okay.

40
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.090
Josie, tick-tock.

41
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.180
We're not gonna be sexy
little high schoolers forever.

42
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.140
Soon we're gonna be old hags
in college.

43
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.390
Do you wanna be the only
girl virgin at Sarah Lawrence?

44
00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.470
Yeah, honestly, maybe.

45
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.060
I might have a good shot
that way.

46
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.500
I don't need this negative,
really sad attitude. Please.

47
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.250
What the fuck are you wearing?

48
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.530
It's really not too late
to turn around, you know?

49
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.320
I think you wanna be here.

50
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.740
Who said that?

51
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.240
- Where'd you get that idea?
- I'm just feeling...

52
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.410
You're getting nervous because
of how excited you are.

53
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.910
- No. No, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

54
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.790
Oh, and we're crossing.
And we're getting in there.

55
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.080
No, I can't, I'm sorry.
Ahhh! Fuck, my arm!

56
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.380
There's nothing wrong
with your arm.

57
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.960
You have Munchausen's.

58
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.670
Look, just follow my lead.

59
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.050
- Hello, ladies.
- [girl 1] Oh.

60
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.380
[girl 2 chuckles] Oh.
You know what?

61
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.630
- Just keep going.
- [PJ] How was your summer?

62
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.430
- Good to see you.
- Okay, you know what?

63
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.890
Uh, it's not gonna
happen, okay?

64
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.890
This school has such
a gay problem.

65
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.480
Okay, no.
No one hates us for being gay.

66
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.060
Everyone hates us for being
gay, untalented, and ugly.

67
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.980
Like, look at Matthieu.

68
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.770
[boy] Rock on, man. Killin' it.

69
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.070
I love what you're doing
with the school play.

70
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.880
- Thanks, bitch.
- [Matthieu and boy chuckle]

71
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.070
- Fuck!
- Yeah.

72
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.570
Knocks it out of the park,
every year.

73
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.540
- Every show.
- Yeah.

74
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.870
- [Isabel giggles]
- [PJ] Ooh. Popcorn.

75
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.050
Don't mind if I do.

76
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.270
- [gentle music playing]
- [laughing]

77
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.930
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Hazel.

78
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.260
Oh, hey, Hazel.
How was your summer?

79
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.470
Were you with your uncle
at the slop farm?

80
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.870
If you mean volunteering at
the National Meat Association,

81
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.310
yeah, it was good.

82
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.730
What are you guys doing here?

83
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.810
You guys never come
to the fair.

84
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.110
What happened to your arm?

85
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.480
Oh, my God,
she ate shit is what happened.

86
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.940
She ate literal shit?
What the fuck?

87
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.110
- Mmm.
- Or did you get beat up again?

88
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.820
[Josie] No, I just tripped
and I--

89
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.830
Or were you jumped?
Was it spy camp?

90
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.370
Did you go to juvie?

91
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.000
<i>- Yeah, we went to juvie.
- [man] Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

92
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.540
<i>- Oh, my God, it was juvie?
- ... it's time to get ready,</i>

93
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.210
<i>get wild, and get horny
for our very own Vikings!</i>

94
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.040
Oh, my God, what did you do?

95
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.630
<i>- [Josie yelping]
- [man] And the man
who will lead us to victory</i>

96
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.720
<i>against the evil, maniacal,</i>

97
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.090
<i>shit-eating
Huntington Ferrets,</i>

98
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.510
<i>let's hear it for Jeff!</i>

99
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.180
[girl 3] Jeff! Have my babies!

100
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.890
[girl 4] Jeff,
fill me with your seed!

101
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.350
- [crowd cheers]
- [PJ groans]

102
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.890
[PJ] I just don't get why girls
like guys like that.

103
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.690
It's like they're like dogs,
or pigs, or is there a...

104
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.210
What's the grossest animal?

105
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.230
[girl 5] Jeff,
come sign my tits!

106
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.460
- [whistle blows]
- [girl 6] Eat my pussy!

107
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.340
That's right.

108
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.410
Oh, fuck. Uh, Hazel.

109
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.620
Gimme that.
Josie, take this. Take this.

110
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.120
- Take this.
- [Josie] No.

111
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.620
Really quick.
This is the moment.

112
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.500
Stop yelling at me!

113
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.850
Could you give that back
really quickly?

114
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.920
- Hey, Brittany.
- PJ.

115
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.630
[PJ] I am loving all the...

116
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.380
holes in your pants.

117
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.510
Thanks.

118
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.510
You look like
a little Dutch boy.

119
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.640
[PJ] Thank you.

120
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.970
So, Britt...
Can I call you Britt?

121
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.020
I prefer if you just
called me my name.

122
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.520
- Britt-a-nay. Um, but...
- [Brittany] No, not that.

123
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.150
[PJ] Brittany.

124
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.650
Are you thinking of riding
the Ferris wheel
at all tonight?

125
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.150
I wasn't. I'm going
on the puke and duke.

126
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.230
I need to pull trig.

127
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.740
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

128
00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:58.950
I'm gonna say something crazy.

129
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.570
I think you could eat food,

130
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.160
digest it, let it marinate,
poop it out.

131
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.490
Mmm, gross.

132
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.160
Maybe this?
You want a bite of this?

133
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.460
- [Brittany] Oh, no.
- Yeah, this is fucking
disgusting. Ugh.

134
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.330
You want a hot dog?
We could go get hot dogs.

135
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.630
Oh, I don't know.

136
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.000
Yeah, we could get the bun
and the ketchup.

137
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.130
- No bun. No.
- You gotta get the bun.

138
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.970
- Yes, you could.
- No.

139
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.010
No bun. [clears throat] Okay.

140
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.300
Um, Isabel.

141
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.600
Josie was just saying
something similar to me.

142
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.760
I don't think so.

143
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.430
[PJ] I think so.
It was really good.

144
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.950
It was super funny.

145
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.440
[PJ clears throat]

146
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.460
You're just so--
You're skinny too, as well.

147
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.900
I'm Josie, by the way,
good evening.

148
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.660
Yeah, you're skinny--

149
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.120
You're real skinny minnie,
aren't ya?

150
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.120
You probably should eat.

151
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.540
They're gonna send you
to the hospital
with how skinny you are.

152
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.100
Uh-oh, call the doctor.
Skinny girl, I see.

153
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.790
Okay, do you guys want
any of our tickets?

154
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.020
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

155
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.720
[groans] Fuck! Fuck!

156
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.720
I don't want to say it,
but we're fucked.

157
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.260
You know what? I'm good.

158
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.260
'Cause it's not gonna happen
for me.

159
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.720
If it's not happening here,

160
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.470
then it's definitely not
happening at Emerson, okay?

161
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.690
I'm done trying to sow
my damn oats.

162
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.770
- No.
- I'm packing up my vagina

163
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.360
and I'm fucking Matthieu.

164
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.820
That's the only hope for me.

165
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.360
- No.
- It's me and Matthieu, man.

166
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.780
And 'cause he's gay
and fearless,

167
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.570
he's probably gonna fuck me
without protection.

168
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:23.780
Then I'm gonna get pregnant.

169
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:24.860
We're going to have
to join a church.

170
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.160
He'll be the gay pastor.

171
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.740
My whole life's fucked!

172
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.580
And yeah, sure,
his sermons are good,

173
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.330
but everybody knows
he's fruity.

174
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.750
Everybody knows
he's fucking fruity!

175
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.460
By the way, our son, Hezekiah,
hates us

176
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.130
'cause he knows
we're both closeted,

177
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.300
but we try to make it
work for him,
but he's not happy.

178
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.710
And yeah, guess what?

179
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.550
The deacon's fucking
the evangelist, man!

180
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.930
He's fucking the evangelist!

181
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.850
[crying] I don't wanna
live like that.

182
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.680
Will you come and visit us
on Sundays?

183
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.560
Please, will you come
and visit us on Sundays?

184
00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.480
- [Jeff] Isabel.
- [Isabel] Leave me alone!

185
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.860
- Stop following me.
- Wait, shut up.

186
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.110
- What?
- Look.

187
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:03.990
- [Isabel] Don't touch me.
- Isabel, baby.

188
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.400
My teeny, tiny baby girl.

189
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.570
Why do you always have
to flirt with other women?

190
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.830
It doesn't count
if they're not in high school.

191
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.160
Especially Mrs. Reilly!

192
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.160
- Josie, offer her a ride.
- I don't think so.

193
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.250
Yes, come on.

194
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:15.790
...Irish Catholic.

195
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.210
- And I'm regular Christian!
- [groaning in frustration]

196
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.960
- [PJ] Josie, ask her. Come on.
- [Josie] PJ, stop.

197
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.840
[Jeff grunts]
You're hurting my head.

198
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.300
You're attacking me,
and it's giving me a migraine.

199
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.670
And it's giving me PTSD
about all the other times
I've had migraines.

200
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.590
- Just do it now.
- No.

201
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:29.530
- Just go fucking ask her.
- No. Isabel, would you
like a safety ride?

202
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.410
Isabel.

203
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.180
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God.

204
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.600
- [Jeff] Isabel...
- [Isabel breathes heavily]

205
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.100
Get out of the car.

206
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.440
You can't tell me what to do.

207
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.310
- Yeah, no, he can't.
- [Jeff] Okay,

208
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.360
I'm sorry that I looked
at Mrs. Reilly

209
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.490
and lightly grazed
her left tit, all right?

210
00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.740
- Move, you prick!
- [groans]

211
00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.780
Uh, excuse me,
she said, "Move, prick."

212
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:50.950
Don't talk to me,
you ugly bitch, okay?

213
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.700
I do not talk to girls
in overalls.

214
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.960
- Hey.
- Okay, I might be ugly,
but these aren't overalls.

215
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.460
Isabel, get out
of the freaking car! Get out!

216
00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.130
Get out! Come on.

217
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.290
- I feel like
we should just drive.
- Drive.

218
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.590
- Drive.
- Let's just go.

219
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.170
Please. You're being
really mean right now.

220
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.510
- He'll move.
- He's not moving.

221
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:06.630
[Isabel] He's gonna move.

222
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.050
- [PJ] We're about to drive.
- Isabel.

223
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.050
- Drive. He'll move.
- [PJ] Just drive. Josie, go.

224
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.510
- Three, two one...
- Pedal to the metal. Drive!

225
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:13.740
[tires screech]

226
00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:18.490
[squealing]

227
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.360
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

228
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.630
Jeff?

229
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.280
Jeff!

230
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.570
- [Jeff groaning]
- [Josie] Are you...
Are you okay?

231
00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:29.740
When people move cars,
don't people move?

232
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.530
Jeffrey, I'm coming!
I'm coming!

233
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.120
You're not alone.
You're not alone.

234
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.660
- Back up! Back up! [screams]
- We didn't even do anything.

235
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.000
- No, come here. [grunting]
- [groaning]

236
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.250
- Man down! Man down!
- [Jeff] You!

237
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:41.580
[PJ] Oh, my God.

238
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.290
- I'm... I'm blacking out.
- No, stay with me.

239
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:44.590
[PJ] We should go. Let's go.

240
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.050
- Let's go.
- Yeah. Okay.

241
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.630
Let's just kind of
peel on out.

242
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:49.130
- [Josie] Fine.
- What did you do to him?

243
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.050
Buckle it for me. Fuck!

244
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.390
- [Jeff wailing]
- You fucking cowards!

245
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:54.610
You better fucking run!

246
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.430
[Jeff] I don't understand.
What the fuck? [sobs]

247
00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.690
[yelling] They're not gonna
get away with this!

248
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.120
[Jeff crying]

249
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:06.360
<i>{\an8}[Principal Meyers, over PA]
Attention.</i>

250
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.280
<i>The library
is out of use again.</i>

251
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.400
<i>Huntington shot up
our remaining books,</i>

252
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.160
<i>so there will be no reading
again this year. Thank you.</i>

253
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.080
Oh, Brittany was just so cute
last night.

254
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.250
Like, "No, I can't eat
a hot dog.

255
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.080
I know I won't even digest it.

256
00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.250
I have to throw up."

257
00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:27.300
And I was, like,
"You can have it."

258
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.420
She's like, "No, not, just...

259
00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.020
Maybe, but not the bun."

260
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.030
Oh, it was just really sweet.

261
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:35.890
You had to be there.

262
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.030
I was there.

263
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.230
Are you serious?

264
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.940
I got "faggot number two"
this time?

265
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.600
You're the sidekick, not me.

266
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.650
'Sup, Ted? How's the family?

267
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.670
Sick. Yeah, you know
what to do.

268
00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.280
Thanks.

269
00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.780
Do you feel like people
are looking at us?
Like, more than usual?

270
00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.450
I don't know.
Did you period yourself?

271
00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:55.720
Mmm... Mmm-mmm. Hey, Sylvie.

272
00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:58.370
Hi.

273
00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.500
[ominous music playing]

274
00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.160
Holy shit. Are you guys okay?

275
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.710
What? Yeah.

276
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.290
- Why wouldn't we be okay?
- [Mr. G] All right, kiddos.

277
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.250
Welcome back to class.

278
00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.130
Hey! The prep club worked hard
on those.

279
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.420
That belongs to the school.

280
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.300
Oh, cool.
So, does your vagina.

281
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.550
[scoffs] Nice try, PJ,

282
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.470
but my vagina belongs
to the government.

283
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.470
All right, check it out.

284
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.910
- Today I got a special
lesson for all of you.
- Josie, so, how'd you do it?

285
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.230
Do what?

286
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.410
[grunts, pants]

287
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.060
[boy] Holy shit. Is he okay?

288
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.460
[Mr. G] Hey, you good, man?

289
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:30.780
- [Jeff groans]
- What the fuck?

290
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.070
- [Mr. G] Yeah, okay, so...
- What the fuck?

291
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.150
[Mr. G] Meanwhile,
back at the ranch...

292
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.570
Okay, so, did he fight back?

293
00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.120
No, literally, how did it go?
Did he fight back?

294
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.870
- I hope you broke a bone.
- If you need a shoulder

295
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:40.490
or anything,
just let me know...

296
00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:42.040
I heard you did
something to him,
I just don't know what.

297
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.290
...and I'll totally let you
lean on me.

298
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:45.330
No, but like honestly,
how did you do it?

299
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.040
Oh, my God.
Annie, they went to juvie.

300
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.170
That's how, okay?

301

[Jeff] Hey. Hey. Hey, you.

This is you.

- [students gasp]
- God damn it, Jeff.

305
00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.840
What the fuck?

306
00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.310
Hey, you couldn't make
that analogy with your fists?

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.410
Um, what did you think
about that?

339
00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:05.950
<i>- [PA chimes]
- [Principal Meyers] Excuse me.</i>

340
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.670
<i>Could the ugly,
untalented gays</i>

341
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.630
<i>please report
to the principal's office?</i>

342
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.630
Guess that's you guys.

343
00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.260
Hello, Principal Meyers.
First of all, I want to say,
God bless--

344
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.880
- Shut up. You know why you're here.
- I don't, actually...

345
00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.590
For committing a crime
against Jeff.

346
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:22.050
Our quarterback
and the most good-looking,

347
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.890
all-American, red-blooded,
muscular man
this town has ever seen.

348
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:25.970
Sir, please,
look in the mirror.

349
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:27.640
- Shush.
- Okay.

350
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.060
The homecoming game
with Huntington
is nearly a month away.

351
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:33.440
Do you know how long we've
been working toward this?

352
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.190
- Yes.
- Yes. It's everywhere.

353
00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:36.490
- [Josie] Twenty years.
- [PJ] Couldn't be clearer.

354
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.570
[Josie] I think I can explain.

355
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:38.900
I can explain.

356
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.950
Jeff is psychotic,
and he tried to murder us.

357
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:42.450
[Principal Meyers] Ha! Sure.

358
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:44.910
You're all victims, and girls
are always right. Right?

359
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:46.250
Yeah, actually.

360
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.330
How come you can't buck up

361
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.040
and learn to protect yourselves
without running somebody over?

362
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.210
Maybe it's because we're small
and he's giant.

363
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.960
So, we needed to use
a little machinery.

364
00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.550
Did you ever think
of that, sir?

365
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.720
- Can we just explain ourselves?
- Maybe I should buy a gun.

366
00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.050
Okay. What? What?
Don't buy a gun.
Nobody said buy a gun.

367
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.060
- Can we just
calm down, everybody.
- Zip it.

368
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.770
- You know what?
- What?

369
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.310
- I'm gonna expel you both.
- No!

370
00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:10.890
- No! No!
- [Principal Meyers] Yes! Yes!

371
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.400
You have to understand that
this was a misunderstanding.

372
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.670
- Really?
- We were just practicing...

373
00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.800
for...

374
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.720
for our self-defense club.

375
00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.830
Self-defense-- What is that?

376
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.290
- [Josie] Uh...
- Is it like a fight club?

377
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:35.340
- Well, here's the thing--
- Yes! Yes!

378
00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.300
- Uh...
- Yes! Yes!

379
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.630
A fight club.

380
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.130
Where we fuckin' beat
each other up and shit.

381
00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:42.220
- No, we don't.
- Yes.

382
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.590
No, we don't. Shut up.

383
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.050
Okay, you know what?
I don't care. Fuck it!

384
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:46.430
- I don't care.
- You're over it, okay.

385
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.470
Yeah. You can beat the shit
out of each other

386
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.270
<i>while you perform
The Vagina Monologues.</i>

387
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.980
Just stay in your lane
until you're munching beaver
at Wesleyan.

388
00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.810
Yes, sir.

389
00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:57.150
[Hazel] I can't believe
they're letting you guys
start a fight club.

390
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:59.530
No, they're... they're not.
We are not.

391
00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.030
What are you talking about?
We're gonna do it.

392
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.110
We're doing it.

393
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.030
PJ, I wasn't being serious.

394
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.620
Josie, did you see the way
that Isabel and Brittany
were looking at us?

395
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.410
- [Josie groans]
- Also, you heard
the announcements.

396
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:11.620
Girls are terrified.

397
00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.330
It's perfect. They need this.

398
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:15.960
Okay, no. They need,
like, mace, maybe.

399
00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.170
We can't do that, okay?
We'd be misleading them.

400
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:20.420
Guys do that
all the time, okay?

401
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.590
That's the point of feminism.

402
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:22.970
That's not the point
of feminism.

403
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:24.840
You also don't care
about feminism.

404
00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.140
<i>Your favorite show
is Entourage.</i>

405
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.680
You're missing the point!

406
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.680
I don't really think I am.
We don't know how to fight.

407
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.230
You guys probably
fought girls in juvie.

408
00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.020
No, we were lying about that,
obviously.

409
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.520
- [grunts frustratedly]
- About juvie?

410
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.360
- [PJ] Yeah, I mean, what?
- Why would you lie to me?

411
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:37.770
You were the one who said
we went to juvie.

412
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:39.190
I just didn't correct you.

413
00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.490
Listen, self-defense
is instinctual common sense.

414
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.780
You try to punch me
in the face,
I stop it from happening.

415
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.950
Whatever. I don't care.
It's easy.

416
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.200
Look, this is how we do this.

417
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.620
Okay, we start with Taekwondo.

418
00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:50.990
Which I've got covered.

419
00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:53.120
And then you guys can move
on to air punches.

420
00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.210
[PJ] Hub-bub-bub-bub.

421
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:55.790
Who do we know?
Who do we know?

422
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:57.040
I'll bring Stella-Rebecca.

423
00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.590
[Josie and PJ]
You know Stella-Rebecca?

424
00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:00.340
Stella-Rebecca who models
at car conventions

425
00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.460
- in Chicago on the weekends?
- Yeah, we're family friends.

426
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.630
Okay, great.
Well, then bring her.

427
00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:05.720
[Josie sighs]

428
00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.470
- Josie.
- What?

429
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:08.970
- We're doing this.
- No.

430
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.680
Yeah. Listen to me.

431
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.430
We teach a bunch of girls
how to defend themselves

432
00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.440
against the evil,
Huntington killers.

433
00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.100
They are grateful to us.

434
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.650
We build a community, we bond,

435
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:21.900
we share, we connect.

436
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.900
We're punching each other,
adrenaline is flowing.

437
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.360
Next thing you know,

438
00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.120
Isabel and Brittany
are kissing us on the mouths.

439
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:29.590
- [player 1] Jeffrey!
- [PJ] Josie...

440
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.700
Isabel knew your name.

441
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.790
- [player 2] Back from the dead.
- If we do this...

442
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.000
- Mmm-hmm.
- Very big "if,"

443
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.630
we just run the risk
of becoming

444
00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:40.540
even bigger losers
than we already are right now.

445
00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.920
And I hate to break it to you,
but we're pretty big losers.

446
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.260
And that is the beauty.
That is the beauty of this.

447
00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.930
Because we are literally
at the bottom.

448
00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:49.090
We're the lowest of the low.

449
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:50.640
- Okay.
- We have nowhere to go but up.

450
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.770
Listen, I think this is
a good idea, okay?

451
00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.440
There's a serious lack
of female solidarity
at this school.

452
00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.650
Not the point, Hazel.
Not the point.

453
00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:01.150
Yeah, I mean,
we just felt like

454
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:03.830
there's a serious lack
of female solidarity
at this school.

455
00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.710
Anyways, totally come by.
See you later.

456
00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.700
What's your plan here?

457
00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.410
I don't need a plan.

458
00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.590
My mom has a business.
All we have to do is yell.

459
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.060
[upbeat electronic
music playing]

460
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.350
[PJ sighs]

461
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:21.880
Okay.

462
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.140
What's up, lads?

463
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:25.340
What the fuck?

464
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.420
- These girls are ugly.
- [Josie] Okay.

465
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:28.930
Where is Stella?

466
00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.550
She was booked
for a car convention.

467
00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.180
What? It's a Monday.

468
00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.850
[Josie] Um, maybe we should go

469
00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:35.060
- before someone cool shows up?
- [door opens]

470
00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.640
Before I die? Pick one.

471
00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.230
[Sylvie] Hey, Hazel.
Thanks for the invite.

472
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:41.190
I love David Fincher.

473
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:43.730
- [sighs] Oh, my God. Well...
- See?

474
00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:46.740
I guess Sylvie's cute
if she lost her braces

475
00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:48.320
and stopped huffing paint.

476
00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.160
[Josie] She'll never stop
huffing paint.

477
00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:51.320
[Hazel] So, I thought
we'd start...

478
00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.470
Um...

479
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:54.430
- Okay.
- Sorry.

480
00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:56.620
[PJ] All right.

481
00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.870
Listen up,
you cunt-sucking
pieces of shit.

482
00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.630
Welcome to our fucking
fight club.

483
00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.460
Um, it's a self-defense club.

484
00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:04.800
It's not really, "Fight."

485
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:08.380
So, as we know,
Huntington is on the prowl,

486
00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.090
and they're picking
on the weak

487
00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.760
and defenseless,
meaning all of you.

488
00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.470
So, we're gonna teach you
how to not take shit.

489
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.640
We're gonna start
with dropkicks,

490
00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.940
tackling, little bit
of knife play.

491
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:21.600
Then, punch-bucket,

492
00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.610
which is when we throw you
in a bucket

493
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.770
and we punch you
until you bleed.

494
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.820
Before that,
perhaps stretches,
icebreakers, and trust falls.

495
00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.030
Is that what happened
to you in juvie?

496
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.160
- Mmm. No. No.
- No.

497
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.240
Juvie was way crazier.

498
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.330
One time, this girl's
punching me in the rain.

499
00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:39.450
Fall to my knees. It's muddy.

500
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.290
I get up. I'm blind.

501
00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.730
Punch her right
in the middle of her face.

502
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:46.690
Broke her fuckin' nose.

503
00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.510
Josie?

504
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.730
Care to share?

505
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:53.360
Yeah, all right.

506
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.140
Juvie was insane.

507
00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.470
Once a girl tried to kill me
with rat poison,

508
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:02.450
so I took her outside
and I punched her
till she died.

509
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.810
So, you killed a girl?

510
00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.690
Uh, no.

511
00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.860
Because the ambulance came
and revived her

512
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.200
and we actually had a really
productive conversation

513
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.160
when she came back
to life, so...

514
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.990
Um, since Josie
literally killed a girl--

515
00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:19.790
She came back to life.

516
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:22.460
Mmm. But I remember her
being dead
for at least a couple minutes.

517
00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.460
Josie is gonna start
by showing you all

518
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.630
how to effectively throw
a solid punch.

519
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:28.060
Josie, if you'll step forward.

520
00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.380
No, I don't wanna do that.

521
00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.380
- What's the problem?
- There's no problem. I just...

522
00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:33.970
No, I'm just not gonna do it.

523
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.550
Come on, they wanna see
the punch.

524
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:37.720
- They don't wanna see it.
- They wanna see. Look at them.

525
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.060
They wanna see the punch.

526
00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:40.140
Who am I gonna punch?

527
00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.520
Punch me. Just punch me.

528
00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.190
- Punch you?
- Yeah, come on.

529
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.270
I can punch you.

530
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:45.770
Yeah. I know how
to take a punch.

531
00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:47.150
Something people
would always say,

532
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:48.270
"PJ knows how
to take a punch."

533
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:49.520
- Come on up.
- [Josie grunts]

534
00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.840
Oh! [groans, thuds]

535
00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:53.670
Oh, fuck!

536
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:56.970
- [Josie sighs]
- [PJ breathing heavily]

537
00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:02.250
Will there an advisor
for this club?

538
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:04.000
Because we'll be suspended
if there isn't.

539
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.080
Who is gonna be dumb enough
to endorse a club

540
00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.140
where we punch each other
in the face?

541
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.110
The Holocaust. It happened.

542
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:14.800
Yes, it did.

543
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.890
<i>But how? The seeds were sown
in the Treaty of Versailles,</i>

544
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.810
which y'all are gonna reenact
while I do some little reading
over here.

545
00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:22.780
[PJ] I mean, he's perfect.

546
00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:24.810
[Josie] No.

547
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:26.100
- What?
- No.

548
00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.690
Please.

549
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:29.440
Dude, we're not
fucking doing this.
I broke your nose.

550
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.320
Yeah, and I've never
had so many girls
look at me in my life.

551
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.610
Fuck! When did you show up?

552
00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:34.110
Hey, guys. [chuckles]

553
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.660
I just wanted to say thank you
so much for last night.

554
00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:39.700
It was just so great,
and I was thinking,

555
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.490
like, if Huntington and me were
in an alleyway

556
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.620
and they were coming at me
with, like, swords
and, like, knives

557
00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.410
and, like, guns and stuff,

558
00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:49.630
and you taught me how
to punch like that,
then I wouldn't die.

559
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:52.130
- That's so great, Sylvie.
- Okay.

560
00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:53.380
But, unfortunately,

561
00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:55.090
Josie doesn't want
to do the club anymore.

562
00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:56.880
What? Why?

563
00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:57.970
I don't know.

564
00:19:58.170 --> 00:19:59.760
Why? It was just
so empowering.

565
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.050
What was empowering?

566
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:04.020
- Oh, my God, hi. Um...
- [players groaning]

567
00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.270
Just, we have a fight club.
It was our fight club

568
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:09.400
for, um, female solidarity
at this school, which we lack.

569
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.960
- [bell rings]
- Isabel, let's go.

570
00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:18.990
[Isabel giggles] Hi, boo-boo.

571
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:20.450
- I'm so strong.
- [Isabel giggles]

572
00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:22.550
[whimsical music playing]

573
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.140
I mean...

574
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.470
[chuckling mischievously]

575
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:32.540
- [PJ] Mr. G, G-man, G-dog.
- [Josie sighs]

576
00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.050
Great class today.

577
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.050
Hey, uh, girl.

578
00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:37.550
Thanks for coming in today.

579
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.840
We have to come in.
It's class.

580
00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.050
Try telling
Dimitri Walker that.

581
00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:45.390
Little motherfucker came
the first week
and I ain't seen him since.

582
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:46.980
Dimitri Walker
committed suicide

583
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:48.730
the first week of school,
Mr. G.

584
00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:51.230
[chuckles] Sure, he did.

585
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:55.650
Anyways, um, we were wondering
if you wanted
to be our club advisor.

586
00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:57.860
- What kind of club is that?
- [PJ] It's a women's club.

587
00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.800
We talk about women's issues.

588
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.970
For example,
periods,

589
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.040
declining egg count,

590
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:06.200
skirts...

591
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.450
Skirts?

592
00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.330
But long ones.
Long denim skirts.

593
00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:13.630
Feminism is what she's saying.
Feminism as a... as a whole.

594
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.710
Why don't you just ask
one of the female teachers?

595
00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:17.300
Mmm. Thought about that,
but we hate them.

596
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.300
- Makes sense.
- [PJ] Yeah.

597
00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.050
Listen. I'm kind of,

598
00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.300
you know,
retiling the bathroom.

599
00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.970
- [PJ] Mmm-hmm.
- Uh, I gotta be at the co-op.

600
00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:27.970
And I'm also dealing with
some relationship drama, so...

601
00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:29.770
Back to the club,

602
00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:31.650
maybe this will be a great way
to take your mind off
of stuff.

603
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.360
[Josie] Can I be honest?
You're a man

604
00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:34.980
who's not coping
with what's going on.

605
00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.440
- Yeah.
- You know what?

606
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.070
My mom did say I need
to pick up a hobby.

607
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:40.280
And here's one thing

608
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.610
- my mom's always said to me.
- [PJ] Mmm.

609
00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:44.740
Sometimes, when you have
a new hobby,

610
00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.370
- don't show up.
- Yeah.

611
00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.700
[Josie] It's, like, you can be
our club advisor,

612
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.620
- but you don't even
come to the dang club.
- No.

613
00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.750
By the way,
great way to be an ally.

614
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:54.000
That's my favorite way
to be an ally.

615
00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.170
You just say
you're doing something

616
00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:57.920
and then you don't do
any of those things.

617
00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.090
You know what I mean?
You say, "I support women."
You don't.

618
00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:01.720
Don't come. Yeah.

619
00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.570
You know what? I'll sign off
on your period club.

620
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.560
- Amazing.
- What?

621
00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:08.810
- Yeah.
- Really?

622
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.160
- Okay.
- [PJ] So cool.

623
00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:11.910
[grunts]

624
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.980
How many girls go
to this school, again?

625
00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.740
Oh, my God, and again,
they're all sixes at best.

626
00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.050
Hey, guys.

627
00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:26.780
[PJ] Mmm. Well, at least
Stella-Rebecca is here.

628
00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:29.910
Are you stressed?
Because I'm stressed.

629
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:31.960
[Mr. G] Hey, ladies.

630
00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.100
Let's get it popping
in this motherfucker.

631
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.310
All right. Um...

632
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.600
Hello, everybody.

633
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:40.630
Okay, excuse me.

634
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.090
Sorry, I feel... Sorry.

635
00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:43.380
Um...

636
00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.030
[loud thumping]

637
00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.610
Everybody, shut the fuck up!

638
00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.250
This isn't a little
hangout, okay?

639
00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:03.700
Oh, it's not a sleepover,
playtime.

640
00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:08.170
There are serious rules
that we need
to establish, 'kay?

641
00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:11.050
First...

642
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:13.390
listen.

643
00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:14.890
Second,

644
00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.640
be on time.

645
00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:21.210
Yeah.

646
00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:23.020
Except for you.
You come whenever you want.

647
00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:26.130
What time is it?

648
00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:27.930
- [Annie] 3:30.
- 3:30!

649
00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.610
Club starts at 3:15.

650
00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.200
Not 3:16.

651
00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.810
[scoffs] Not 3:17,

652
00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:41.360
but the doors close at 3:15.

653
00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.170
No exceptions.

654
00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:45.820
I don't care if you're like...

655
00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.660
- [door opens]
- "Oh, but I had to go
to extra help for math

656
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.450
because I... I need
to get a full ride

657
00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:54.000
because my mom
lives in a trailer

658
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.250
and she loves her boyfriend
more than me."

659
00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:58.420
La, la, la. Blah, blah, blah.

660
00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.040
Shut up, okay?

661
00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.690
My dad left me,
and I'm incredibly punctual.

662
00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:12.600
Um, hey, guys. Come on in.

663
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.890
Nice.

664
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:15.850
[PJ] Uh, we're just getting
started here.

665
00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:17.540
So, um...

666
00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:21.230
Today I think we're gonna
start with some body contact.

667
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:22.980
We're gonna do wrestling.

668
00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.280
I think I need a volunteer.

669
00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.030
Brittany, you're close to me.
You wanna...

670
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:29.110
I'm sorry. I thought
we weren't allowed to be late.

671
00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:31.530
- That's not true. It's about...
- Oh, that's about next week.

672
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:32.870
- Yeah, next week.
- So, the rules for next week.

673
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.290
Don't be late.

674
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:35.540
- But this week is good...
- [PJ] Yeah. No worries.

675
00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:36.790
...if you're late.
Take it easy.

676
00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:38.000
Okay, I'm sorry.
I just want to make sure.

677
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.000
This is a self-defense
class, right?

678
00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.250
Where we can learn
to protect ourselves

679
00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:42.880
against, like,
football players.

680
00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.960
And Huntington? 'Cause, um,
they're gonna pork us.

681
00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.380
[chuckles nervously, sighs]
They're gonna pork us.

682
00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.470
I thought we were fighting
each other for money.

683
00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:51.890
There's a cash prize, right?

684
00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:53.850
[Isabel] I thought this was
to be part of, like,

685
00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.240
a local underprivileged
female community.

686
00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.060
My identity is completely
attached to hers,

687
00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.690
so I just kind of go
wherever she goes.

688
00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:03.860
Everyone's here
for a good reason.

689
00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.400
So, uh, you know, like...

690
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.990
- Why are we nitpicking reasons?
- Yeah. How about this?

691
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:10.990
- Let's jump in. Right?
- Yeah. For sure.

692
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:12.410
- Love that.
- [PJ] Yeah.

693
00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:14.510
- I'll go.
- Great. Yeah.

694
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.250
- [Annie grunts]
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. hey.

695
00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:22.580
I don't know about this shit.

696
00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:25.000
What the hell?
You didn't even warn me.

697
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.090
Okay, we didn't get
warnings at juvie.

698
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:28.510
- Look.
- [Josie] We can take it slower.

699
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:29.920
- [PJ] Okay.
- Maybe, yeah, try that.

700
00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.550
Take that route.
Little slower.

701
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.100
Look. You just use
your natural instincts,
just come at me.

702
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.360
Whatever you want, 'kay?

703
00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:37.520
- [PJ grunts]
- Oh, fuck.

704
00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.850
- [girls gasp]
- [PJ] Okay.

705
00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:41.480
That's great.
I say that we go again.

706
00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.150
- Oh!
- [Annie] Ow, fuck! My back.

707
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:45.230
Oh, shit.
Man, we gotta shut this down.

708
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:46.820
We don't have to shut it down.
She's fine.

709
00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.440
- Are you fine? Are you okay?
- Yeah, she's okay.

710
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.360
- She's totally fine.
- Shut this shit down.

711
00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.360
- [Josie] No, wait, Mr. G.
- Shut this shit down.

712
00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.780
No, don't blow the whistle.
Don't blow the whistle.

713
00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:55.700
I know that,

714
00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:58.580
you know, this is
a little messy right now

715
00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.620
but, like, the only way

716
00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:04.060
that we can learn
how to defend ourselves
is by teaching each other.

717
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:07.380
Huntington is coming.

718
00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:09.090
[inspirational music playing]

719
00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:10.310
We need this.

720
00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.800
I know that things
might seem scary,

721
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.030
but that's okay, because...

722
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:20.060
because...

723
00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:23.140
Because you're gonna
be fucking pros.

724
00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:24.810
- Is what I was gonna say. Yes.
- Yeah.

725
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:26.230
- Right?
- [Josie] Yes.

726
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:28.480

get assaulted

- Lucky number seven, okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

729
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.740
And I... I'm gonna finally
reverse-stalk my stalker.

730
00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.330
Yeah, absolutely.

731
00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:39.490
[Sylvie] And for me,

732
00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:41.390
I'll be able
to kill my stepdad.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.790
- Awesome.
- Okay.

734
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:45.120
[PJ] And if you believe
in yourselves

735
00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.420
and you believe in us
and then you trust us,

736
00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.500

- Yeah. Okay.

part of the club.

811
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.420
Yeah, I know.
We're empowering them. Duh.

812
00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:21.340
No, I mean, seriously,
to have a safe space
like this,

813
00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:22.930
it means a lot to people,

814
00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:25.390
and I think that if we took
some time to spend a meeting

815
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.140
and actually get
to know these girls,

816
00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:29.640
like, it would be
really important,

817
00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.870
instead of just, like,
sweating on them and...

818
00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:39.480
Hazel, that is a genuinely
brilliant idea.

819
00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.070
- Yeah.
- I love talking
about my trauma.

820
00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:45.280

- therapy session.
- What?

822
00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:49.370
It just makes girls
weirdly horny. It does.

- Bonjour.</i>

- I just wanted to say

825
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:55.000
I'm loving what I'm hearing
about the club.

826
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.560
It seems so supportive
of women.

827
00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.710
Especially the hot ones.

828
00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:00.550
Yeah, well,
all women are hot to me.

829
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:02.510
Listen, it's really cute
and everything,

830
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:07.510
but we're getting
a little close to the game now
and, um...

831
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:08.850
I'm just a bit concerned

832
00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:10.970
it might be taking away
attention from our team.

833
00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:15.370
I think that's, like,
literally impossible to do.

834
00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:18.540
Okay.

835
00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.860
[Josie] So, we know
that the club has been a place

836
00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.910
where we can feel
empowered physically,

837
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:29.700
but we also thought
it could be

838
00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.370
a safe space and a place
where we can open up

839
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:33.890
and talk about our feelings.

840
00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.640
Okay, so who's been raped?

841
00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:39.770
Just, you know,
raise your hand.

842
00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.730
Gray area stuff counts too.

843
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.860
Everybody knows the situation
with my stepdad.

844
00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:58.940
He's just obsessed
with Friday movie nights.

845
00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:02.830
I mean, God, I get it,
you're my new stepdad, but...

846
00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:04.570
fuck, whatever.

847
00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:06.200
You know?

848
00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.530
Every time I call the police
about my stalker,

849
00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:10.740
they tell me to fill out
an online form.

850
00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.830
And then the form
tells me to call,

851
00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:16.120
so I call and then they say
they can't get involved
until he tries to kill me.

852
00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.600
And he keeps saying
he's going to...

853
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.540
but that doesn't count.

854
00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.630
So, it's just, like, annoying.

855
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:23.060
Been there.

856
00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:25.460
We've all been there.

857
00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:28.260
Well, I've been assaulted,
like, a million times,

858
00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.550
but I'm more annoyed

859
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:34.850
that everyone knows me
for being beautiful
and popular

860
00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:37.940
and no one knows
that I'm actually smart
and super driven.

861
00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:41.910
Like, I literally own
a jewelry business
and no one talks about it!

862
00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:44.940
See?

863
00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:47.570
[Hazel] Well, ever since
my parents' divorce,

864
00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:50.530
my mom has been doing this,
like, midlife crisis.

865
00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:53.200
I don't know how that's really
sitting with me, you know?

866
00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:55.120
It's been really, really dark.

867
00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.120
This has just been really
meaningful to me to, like,

868
00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:01.630
get to know some new people
who actually want to,
like, get to know me.

869
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:04.140
- I want to bring it back
to Brittany for one second.
- I can go next,

870
00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.230
if that's okay.

871
00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.180
I don't really like talking
about juvie

872
00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.100
and everything that happened
this summer, um...

873
00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.270
You know, obviously,
we get a lot of props
or whatever

874
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:19.740
'cause people think
it's so badass.

875
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:23.560
But, really wasn't.

876
00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:28.240
I mean, unless you consider
getting hazed horrifically
every single night,

877
00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.570
like, badass. I mean, um,

878
00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:33.950
obviously, you know,
we had to survive the Tributes

879
00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:36.040
and, you know,
I did have to, like,

880
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:38.080
fight people basically
every single night.

881
00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.290
People were betting on us
and we were given, like,

882
00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:44.750
shivs and rusty pocket knives
and splintered wood

883
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:47.090
and, um, pipes as well.

884
00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:50.300
And, um, we had to just,
like, fight people,
sometimes to the death.

885
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.130
Um, and I still hear
their screams at night,

886
00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:55.490
um, and that guilt
probably will, like,
always shackle me forever.

887
00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.600
I realize now, I don't have
to be that person anymore.

888
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.440
Like, I don't have
to just let things

889
00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:07.020
happen to me
'cause of you guys.

890
00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:10.030
And, um, I am,
like, really grateful

891
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:12.610
for what the club
has become and...

892
00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:14.320
Um...

893
00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.930
Just especially, you know,
from where we started
and, uh...

894
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.000
Yeah, sorry.

895
00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.620
[chuckles] I feel like
I kinda killed the vibe.

896
00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:22.870
I've never really,

897
00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:26.290
I guess, said that
to anyone before. Sorry.

898
00:34:26.490 --> 00:34:28.050
People wanna, like,
wrap up maybe or...

899
00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:29.560
I'm going through a divorce.

900
00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.680
Whoo! That shit felt
good to say.

901
00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.180
Ooh, I'll tell y'all,

902
00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:37.320
men... men need therapy.

903
00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.930
[softly] Yeah.

904
00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.870
[in normal voice]
I think that's a good place
to maybe wrap up.

905
00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:54.340
- Hey.
- Hey.

906
00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:56.220
Um...

907
00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:59.010
Thank you, um, for that.

908
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:02.430
Um...

909
00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:07.040
I don't know
what you're doing tomorrow,

910
00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:11.420
but I was going to study
for Mr. G's women murdered
in history test,

911
00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:13.820
if you wanna...

912
00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.360
Yeah.

913
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.660
Yeah, okay, sure.

914
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.390
[man and woman
moaning in pleasure]

915
00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:25.540
Mom?

916
00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:29.670
[woman giggles]

917
00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:32.280
[man groans]

918
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.630
Mom?

919
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:39.030
Oh, hi, honey.

920
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:40.720
What are you doing home
so early?

921
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:45.460
[grunts, groans]

922
00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:46.600
Uh...

923
00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:48.480
Are you kidding me?

924
00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:52.150
I had a long day. [chuckles]

925
00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:55.190
[Jeff] Mrs. Callahan,
can I have a snack?

926
00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.220
[Stella-Rebecca]
First club fundraiser.

927
00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:01.890
I'm so excited.
Great turnout, right?

928
00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:04.310
Hello, ladies.

929
00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:05.810
[Stella-Rebecca]
Hi, Bill, Bob, Fred...

930
00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:07.940
I don't know why anyone
wants my old, dirty underwear.

931
00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.560
It's so weird. [chuckles]

932
00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.150
Hey, Britt, uh, don't let 'em
touch in between your toes.

933
00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:13.400
Thanks, PJ.

934
00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.110
- [Hazel groaning]
- Ah. We're havin' fun.

935
00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:16.700
We're selling panties.

936
00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.090
You know, Brittany said she'd
make me a custom bracelet.

937
00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.740
Very nice.

938
00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.120
[PJ] Do you wanna,
um, celebrate?

939
00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.930
We could get some chicken
on a stick tonight.

940
00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:28.970
Um, I can't. Uh...

941
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:32.670
Isabel and I have plans, so...

942
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:33.960
[Hazel continues groaning]

943
00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.880
You're hanging out
with Isabel?

944
00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.130
Yep.

945
00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:39.390
[PJ] Fuck, you're fast.
Oh, my God, okay.

946
00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:41.220
I have to keep up.

947
00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:42.560
Hazel, what is wrong?

948
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:43.930
Are you constipated
or something?

949
00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:45.270
[Hazel] I'm fucking tired.

950
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:47.600
My mom was up all night
fucking the meathead.

951
00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.560
What meathead?
Hi. Underwear, cars.

952
00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:50.980
- Thanks.
- You know, like, the guy.

953
00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:52.540
He's like the crybaby.

954
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:55.900
With the balls?

955
00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.300
He catches them
and he... he throws them?

956
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:02.050
He's like the main guy.

957
00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:04.220
[sputters] Jeff?

958
00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.410
Is your mom hooking up
with Jeff?

959
00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:09.000
I just thought Jeff might be
her safe word.

960
00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.670
Jeff is his name, you idiot.

961
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:12.790
Just get the hot people
confused, Jesus.

962
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:14.300
[Stella-Rebecca yelps]

963
00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:15.460
I'm good. [chuckles]

964
00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.170
[PJ] Looking good, Stella!

965
00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:18.470
[Isabel laughs]

966
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:19.610
[PJ] Are you gonna tell her?

967
00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:24.970
[Tim] Yeah, they said
they were in juvie this summer.

968
00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:27.370
Okay, are you sure
they're not in the system?

969
00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:31.520
But isn't every kid from
Rockbridge Falls sent there?

970
00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:32.660
[player] Hit me! Ow!

971
00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:36.380
Okay, yeah, Essex County.
Any others?

972
00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:39.610
Got it. Thank you.

973
00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:41.380
- [players shouting]
- [sighs]

974
00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:46.130
[whistle blows]

975
00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:48.200
Jeff!

976
00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:51.140
[easygoing music playing]

977
00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.000
[Josie laughing]

978
00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.550
No, yeah, but I thought
she was maybe dead.

979
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:59.260
- Not good.
- That's not the best.

980
00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:02.340
- No. No, not great.
- That's not a great thing.

981
00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:03.940
[Josie and Isabel laughing]

982
00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.730
I wanted to...

983
00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.390
I wanted to tell you
that, um, I'm...

984
00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:14.330
I'm very glad
that I joined the club.

985
00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:16.830
Me too.

986
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:21.150
I think it's really impressive

987
00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:24.370
that you and PJ went through
everything that you did

988
00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.830
and now have decided
to help the rest of us.

989
00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:30.300
I mean even that story
you told the other day.

990
00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:33.540
You're really, really brave.

991
00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:34.960
No. [chuckles]

992
00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.380
No. No, no.

993
00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:39.710
Yes. I mean you almost
killed a girl. [chuckles]

994
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:40.860
You're...

995
00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:42.980
Yeah, you're...

996
00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:45.570
really, really brave.

997
00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:50.070
What?

998
00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.710
Actually, Isabel, uh...

999
00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.650
- There's, um...
- Yeah?

1000
00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:02.190
There's something
you maybe should know.

1001
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:03.500
Uh...

1002
00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.660
I mean it's pretty insane.

1003
00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:09.550
Okay. [chuckles]
What... what is it?

1004
00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:12.550
I just, I...

1005
00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:17.460
I heard Jeff
is cheating on you.

1006
00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:18.600
- [music stops]
- [glasses clinking]

1007
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:23.730
Wait... [laughing]

1008
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:28.100
Wait, what? [chuckles]

1009
00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:31.390
I... I... Sorry, I think I...
I heard...

1010
00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:36.480
Um, what? Um...
Who... who told you that?

1011
00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:41.360
Hazel told me that, uh,
he and Mrs. Callahan

1012
00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:45.070
are at it, pretty much,
like, every night,

1013
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:47.950
- like, constantly.
- [Josie and Isabel laughing]

1014
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:52.080
I mean, just at it
with each other,
which is pretty fucked up.

1015
00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:55.160
Um, even though I guess
it's, technically, it's legal,

1016
00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.170
it's still just

[Sylvie] And like, at least
we went out with a bang.

1187
00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.550
I mean, that was
fucking insane!

1188
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:47.720
[girls laugh]

1189
00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:49.510
There was just, like,
fire everywhere.

1190
00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:51.520
[PJ] Wait. Stop.

1191
00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:53.810
We don't-- Wait, no,
we don't know that for sure.

1192
00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:57.900
PJ, don't be sad it's over.
Be happy it happened.

1193
00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:00.610
[PJ] All right, can everyone
calm the fuck down, please?

1194
00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:03.330
The club is not over,
Josie, right?

1195
00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:05.750
[Isabel] No matter what,

1196
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:08.370
this club has brought me
so much.

1197
00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:09.510
I feel...

1198
00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:14.680
so much more powerful
and, um...

1199
00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:16.640
protected.

1200
00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:18.830
- Me too.
- [PJ chuckles]

1201
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:20.340
- Great.
- [Hazel] Oh, my God, PJ.

1202
00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:22.170
Okay, I'm sorry
that you didn't get

1203
00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:23.260
what you wanted
out of this group,

1204
00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:25.220
but I think
the rest of us did.

1205
00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:26.800
Oh. Good for fucking you,
Hazel.

1206
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.140
I'm glad that you finally
wrote one email.

1207
00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:30.890
- Accomplished a lot.
- I actually did.

1208
00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:32.970
I practically ran this club
for you and Josie.

1209
00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:34.680
Hey, let's calm down, maybe.

1210
00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:37.020
You really think
that you're the reason
that we have this club?

1211
00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:38.270
The reason? No.

1212
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:39.440
But I can tell everyone that
if you want.

1213
00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.900
Hazel. Uh, hey,
let's calm down, right?

1214
00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:43.480
You're really ungrateful.

1215
00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.530
You're so lucky
that we even let you
be a part of this.

1216
00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:47.380
PJ, you're a liar.

1217
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:51.530
[PJ scoffs]

1218
00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:54.040
Yeah, well,
you have no friends,

1219
00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.390
and a skank as a mom, so...

1220
00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:11.940
- [Josie] Hazel.
- [PJ scoffs]

1221
00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:18.700
[door closes]

1222
00:49:21.790 --> 00:49:22.790
[Brittany] PJ...

1223
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:26.170
This doesn't mean
it wasn't worth it.

1224
00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:33.220
[mellow music playing]

1225
00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:35.580
[students chattering]

1226
00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:36.970
[crying]

1227
00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:46.710
Hazel.

1228
00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:47.860
[door closes]

1229
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:51.530
Whoa.

1230
00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:56.530
I love God.

1231
00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:58.870
- Yes, same.
- [chuckles]

1232
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.530
Yeah.

1233
00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:11.800
Oh, my God,
I always wanted
one of these.

1234
00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:17.330
But my mom says
they hide your figure
and make you look ugly.

1235
00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:19.450
Um, you can borrow it
if you want.

1236
00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:21.350
Like, as a joke or...

1237
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:23.500
whatever.

1238
00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:24.670
Thanks.

1239
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:25.810
[Josie] Yeah.

1240
00:50:32.650 --> 00:50:34.390
[Isabel] Wow, you and PJ

1241
00:50:34.590 --> 00:50:36.350
really have been
friends forever.

1242
00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:39.160
Oh, I mean,
since the first grade, so...

1243
00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:42.980
We had the same
babysitter, Rhodes.

1244
00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:45.870
PJ called her Gay Yoda,
but I think she's kind of
like a mentor.

1245
00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:49.650
[Josie clears throat]

1246
00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:52.840
Yeah, but you guys, like,
could not be more different.

1247
00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:54.840
She's so, like...

1248
00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.260
like...

1249
00:50:58.010 --> 00:50:59.450
[chuckles] You know?

1250
00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:00.600
- [chuckles] Yeah.
- And you're...

1251
00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:02.560
You're so, like...

1252
00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:06.060
[both chuckle]

1253
00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.440
- You know what I mean?
- No, yeah, I know.

1254
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:16.530
Josie...

1255
00:51:17.110 --> 00:51:18.280
[gentle music playing]

1256
00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:51.730
[grunts softly]

1257
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:01.570
[Isabel breathing heavily]

1258
00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:07.060
[PJ] I'm tryna help
your jewelry business grow.

1259
00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:08.730
- [Brittany] Really?
- [PJ] Yeah.

1260
00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:10.500
I don't know if I can hire you
because you're like a convict.

1261
00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:15.450
Wow.

1262
00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:19.280
This is, um, a total shithole.

1263
00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:20.420
[Brittany chuckles lightly]

1264
00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:26.180
Kind of a mess. Sorry.

1265
00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:32.750
Well, I hear that
if you hire a convict,

1266
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:34.150
they give you a tax break.

1267
00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:37.970
[Brittany groans]

1268
00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:40.140
I fucking hate Mr. G.

1269
00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:42.430
Everything he says
is so pathetic.

1270
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:44.640
Oh, yeah. I mean,

1271
00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:47.140
I feel like he, like,
jerks off to a poster

1272
00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:50.230
of the 1999 Rockbridge team
every single night, so...

1273
00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:52.290
Literally the peak
of his existence.

1274
00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:00.380
[Brittany sighs]

1275
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:05.680
Like, what is the point
of this assignment?

1276
00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:11.210
Who is bell hooks
and why do we care?

1277
00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:13.730
Oh, sorry, I'm just trying to,
like, study over here.

1278
00:53:14.850 --> 00:53:15.980
[whispering] Watch out.

1279
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:27.370
What?

1280
00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:30.410
Uh, nothing, I'm just...

1281
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.690
I'm just concerned
'cause I'm, like...

1282
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:39.320
Your wrists are so small,
and the pen is so heavy
that I'm like,

1283
00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:41.740
- "Is she getting exhausted?"
- Mmm.

1284
00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:43.660
I'm surprised you can even see
what you're doing

1285
00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:44.950
with all the surface area

1286
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:46.180
- that yours are taking up.
- [gasps]

1287
00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:48.290
Wow.

1288
00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:49.660
Must be a struggle
for you to write.

1289
00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:51.250
Okay, does this hurt?

1290
00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:53.210
Actually, yeah, that does hurt
my tiny, delicate wrists.

1291
00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:54.960
Yeah, that was
the lightest tap of all time.

1292
00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:56.420
- Can you feel that?
- Can't even feel that.

1293
00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.310
- Can't feel anything.
- Just like muscles in there.

1294
00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:08.320
Um...

1295
00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:09.910
Uh...

1296
00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:14.370
PJ, I'm... I'm straight.

1297
00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:20.800
Oh.

1298
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:24.590
Um...

1299
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:30.080
Yeah. Um...

1300
00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:33.210
- I'm... I'm sorry
if you misread anything.
- No, that's all...

1301
00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:36.190
It's all good. I shouldn't
have assumed anything.

1302
00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:42.320
[drums playing]

1303
00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:54.910
[sighs] Um...

1304
00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:57.500
I wanted to tell you something.

1305
00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:00.190
What?

1306
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:02.920
Like, something that happened
last night.

1307
00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:05.720
What happened?

1308
00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:08.430
[softly] With Isabel.

1309
00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:13.760
Wait.

1310
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:18.230
Wait, seriously?

[spectators cheering]

1312
00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:24.650

I thought you were
super Christian.

1319

I know. I just like getting
caught up in the festivities.

do the pep rally.</i>

Listen guys.
It doesn't matter...

1415
01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:03.930
the reason that we started
this, right? Like...

1416
01:00:04.850 --> 01:00:06.250
The point of the club

1417
01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:10.170
is that we all learn
from each other, right?

1418
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:13.300
And... and we had a great time
doing it and...

1419
01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:14.670
I thought this club
was for sisterhood,

1420
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:17.130
but it was for your own
selfish interests?

1421

All right, look.

1428
01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.880
You know what?
I'm not a fuckin' idiot.

1429
01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.170
I just look like this.

1430
01:00:53.370 --> 01:00:55.420
I wasn't doin' this shit
as a distraction.

1431
01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:58.340
I actually was doin' this shit
'cause I actually liked
y'all group

1432
01:00:58.540 --> 01:00:59.590
and what y'all stood for.

1433
01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:02.260
- Wait, we can explain.
- I trusted you two

1434
01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:04.600
and y'all exploited
my solidarity.

1435
01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:07.440
I played the role
of an amazin' ally.

1436
01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:08.810
Is this about the time I said

1437
01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:10.950
Amelia Earhart
was a fake hero?

1438
01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:13.360
Because it's true.

1439
01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.610
Many a guy fly planes
without crashing,

1440
01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:17.800
but you never hear about them.

1441
01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:20.030
And then it's like,

1442
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:22.410
[in high-pitched voice]
"Oh, it's so hard
to be a girl."

1443
01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:24.080
"We, like, make less money."

1444
01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.120
"We had to lose
our last names."

1445
01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.580
"I love you."

1446
01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:29.540
"I want to be with you
for the rest of our lives."

1447
01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:33.170
"Oh, I love the mint green
backsplash in the kitchen."

1448
01:01:33.370 --> 01:01:34.460

1449
01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:36.340
you leave me

the fucking kitchen
is lime green.

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.180
Yeah, I think that moved
away from us.

Oh, you look confused,
like how I'm confused
right now,

1454
01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:48.430
on how you created
a fucking fight club
to get some cooch.

1455
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:51.690
And for what? Y'all ain't even
know how to work that thing.

1456
01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:53.650
And I know y'all ain't
tickling the pearl,

1457
01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:54.900

I'm talking about?

1458
01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:56.150

Caressing the back

1459
01:01:56.350 --> 01:01:58.110

and all type of--

1460
01:01:58.310 --> 01:02:01.070
Sorry, I just don't know
if you're supposed
to be talking to us like that.

1461
01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:02.660

Sorry, what does that have
to do with anything?

1473
01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:38.610
If Isabel wasn't so desperate
to get revenge,

1474
01:02:38.810 --> 01:02:40.320
then we wouldn't have
blown up Jeff's car

1475
01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.110
and then he wouldn't be
so upset

1476
01:02:42.310 --> 01:02:44.450
and then whatever the fuck
just happened
would not have happened.

just goes on me then?

be traced back to you at all?

1479
01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.140
Well, I mean, yeah,
it was your idea
to start the whole club.

1480
01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.840
I didn't want to do this
from the beginning.

1481
01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.920
You know that.

1482
01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:02.010
I just followed your lead
like an idiot.

1483
01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:04.840

you created that insane story

to fight other girls

Yeah, well, that's 'cause
Brittany's straight, so...

Yeah, no, shit,
she's straight.

Why... why... why you look
like a scared puppy?

1555
01:06:49.710 --> 01:06:51.200
[Josie] Hey, Rhodes.

1556
01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:52.710
Do you have a minute to talk?

1557
01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.410
If you don't wanna
borrow firearms,

1558
01:06:55.610 --> 01:06:57.260
- then why are you here?
- Um...

1559

- Like, for advice?

I'm not your Gay Yoda, Josie.

You're too old for this shit.

[sighs]

1563
01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.130
Girl, when I was
in high school,

1564
01:07:06.330 --> 01:07:08.800
people found out I was gay,
nobody wanted to be my friend.

1565
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.090
And back then it was worse

1566
01:07:10.290 --> 01:07:12.970
because they hated you
just for being gay.

1567
01:07:13.170 --> 01:07:15.090
[both] Not for being
gay and untalented.

1568
01:07:15.290 --> 01:07:16.970
Mmm.

1569
01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:18.850
Sorry, people didn't know
you were gay?

1570
01:07:19.050 --> 01:07:20.950
Girl, I wore a weave
back then, okay?

1571
01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:22.810
And I used to say,

1572
01:07:23.010 --> 01:07:24.190
[in high-pitched voice]
"Hey, girl. Hey..."

1573
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:25.600
[in normal voice]
Look, that's not the point.

1574
01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:26.690
You want some advice?

1575
01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:28.570
Invest in yourself,

1576
01:07:28.770 --> 01:07:30.360
teach people to fear you
instead of love you.

1577
01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:33.530
I don't wanna, like, deny
your advice, obviously.

1578
01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:34.860
I just, um...

1579
01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:37.200
PJ and I are actually
in a fight right now.

1580
01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.620
- So, like...
- [coughing]

1581
01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:40.370
Like, that's the advice
that I need.

1582
01:07:40.570 --> 01:07:43.580
I never had many friends,
and that's... that's sad.

1583
01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:46.000
And as I've gotten old
in this world,

1584
01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.810
it's just gotten more sad.

1585
01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:51.630
Okay, um...

1586
01:07:51.830 --> 01:07:53.510
I think I'm just gonna go
to the game

1587
01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:55.510
and then work it out
with PJ there.

1588
01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:56.680
I wouldn't do that.

1589
01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:57.850
Why not?

1590
01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.890
- It's with Huntington, right?
- Yeah.

1591
01:08:00.090 --> 01:08:03.020
Well, I'm guessing
they've been fucking people up
for the past month, right?

1592
01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:05.600
- Yeah.
- So, they're violent.

1593
01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.060
What do you think's
gonna happen tonight?

1594
01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.040
I don't know. Football?

- Game? Tackle?

01:08:12.310 --> 01:08:13.340
Oh, girl.

1597
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:16.910
There is a 50-year rivalry
going on.

1598
01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:19.010
They always fuck up
some unlucky player.

1599
01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:21.870
How you don't know--

1600
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:24.710
In '77, they burned him
at a stake with his dog.

1601
01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:27.880
In '92, they drowned him
in a giant kiddie pool.

1602
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:31.000
And in '03, they pulled
his body apart with horses.

1603
01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.380
It's called quartering.

1604
01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:33.920
I know... I know
what it's called.

1605
01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:36.050
So, tonight,
I'm stayin' inside

She said
this Huntington shit's
way darker than we thought.

Apparently,
every time Huntington
plays Rockbridge,

1628
01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:47.540
they try to kill a player
and his pets.

'Cause it is.
Why would we do that?

1645
01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:21.170
Because we made
these girls trust us

PJ has something
to say to Hazel, so...

Do the apology, instead.

I'm sorry that I called
your mom a skank.

And I'm sorry

for saying that you have
no friends really loud

And I'm sorry
for being an asshole
a lot of the time.

Most of the--
All of the time.

1673
01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:43.950
And I do think that it's nice
you always take notes

1674
01:11:44.150 --> 01:11:48.380
and then you type them up
and email them to everyone...

1675
01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:52.760
and I really appreciate it.

1676

Yes.

[Josie] I don't want
to interrupt this

but we don't have time now

1680

that Huntington
is trying to kill

1682
01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:10.470

1683
01:12:10.670 --> 01:12:11.560
What are you even
talking about, Josie?

1684
01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:12.930
Nobody's even over there.

1685
01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:14.850
[Josie] Oh, my God,
nobody is even over there.

1686
01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:16.600
Well, that is obviously
a red flag.

1687
01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.020
Are we not reading that
as a red flag? That's crazy.
