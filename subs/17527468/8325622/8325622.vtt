2
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.970
Tonight is the fucking night, okay?

3
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.600
We've looked like shit for
years, and we are developing.

4
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.560
I would say I'm actually
mostly developed.

5
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.770
We're finally hot. At
least, according to me.

6
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.230
We're getting out there.

7
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.770
We're getting in the cooch, my girl.

8
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.480
We are getting in the
puss and we're gettin' wet.

9
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.150
Man, speak for yourself.

10
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.280
Nobody's gonna wanna fuck me this year,

11
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.740
just like nobody wanted to fuck
me last year or the year before.

12
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.200
Okay, well, I'm gonna talk to Brittany.

13
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.400
I think that it's time.

14
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.490
Oh, really? It's time?

15
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.740
There wasn't time in the last 11 years

16
00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.290
we've all been going to school together?

17
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.580
I've been building tension.

18
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.960
You know, you could say hi to Isabel.

19
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.160
Yeah, okay.

20
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.580
And just what would I say?

21
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.050
Like, "Hey, girl, what's
up? How's your boyfriend?

22
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.880
How's his penis?

23
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.880
Still awesome and big and throbbing
and, uh, like a male penis?"

24
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.590
They could have broken
up, you never know.

25
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.390
The fair is like a
completely fresh start.

26
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.060
I'm not doin' that with
Isabel, you know what I mean?

27
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.310
Like, I'm... I'm... I'm playin'
the long game with her, okay?

28
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.310
- Mmm.
- Here's how it's gonna shake out.

29
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.610
I don't speak to the bitch for years.

30
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.820
Bam! It's the 20th high school reunion.

31
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.280
I show up, I'm in a little suit

32
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.360
like the lesbian I am,
you know what I mean?

33
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.570
It's probably white, okay?

34
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.080
She looks at me, I look back at her.

35
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.160
What the fuck happened to her?

36
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.700
She's washed up.

37
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.670
I mean Jeff has run her ragged.

38
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.790
That's when my ass swoops in, okay?

39
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.380
That made me so sad. What? Okay.

40
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.880
Josie, tick-tock.

41
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.970
We're not gonna be sexy
little high schoolers forever.

42
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.930
Soon we're gonna be old hags in college.

43
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.180
Do you wanna be the only
girl virgin at Sarah Lawrence?

44
00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.380
Yeah, honestly, maybe.

45
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.850
I might have a good shot that way.

46
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.290
I don't need this negative,
really sad attitude. Please.

47
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.040
What the fuck are you wearing?

48
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.320
It's really not too late
to turn around, you know?

49
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.110
I think you wanna be here.

50
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.530
Who said that?

51
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.030
- Where'd you get that idea?
- I'm just feeling...

52
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.200
You're getting nervous
because of how excited you are.

53
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.700
- No. No, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

54
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.580
Oh, and we're crossing.
And we're getting in there.

55
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.870
No, I can't, I'm sorry.
Ahhh! Fuck, my arm!

56
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.170
There's nothing wrong with your arm.

57
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.750
You have Munchausen's.

58
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.460
Look, just follow my lead.

59
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.840
- Hello, ladies.
- Oh.

60
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.170
Oh. You know what?

61
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.495
- Just keep going.
- How was your summer?

62
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.220
- Good to see you.
- Okay, you know what?

63
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.680
Uh, it's not gonna happen, okay?

64
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.680
This school has such a gay problem.

65
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.270
Okay, no. No one hates us for being gay.

66
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.850
Everyone hates us for being
gay, untalented, and ugly.

67
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.770
Like, look at Matthieu.

68
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.560
Rock on, man. Killin' it.

69
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.860
I love what you're doing
with the school play.

70
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.670
Thanks, bitch.

71
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.860
- Fuck!
- Yeah.

72
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.360
Knocks it out of the park, every year.

73
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.330
- Every show.
- Yeah.

74
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.660
Ooh. Popcorn.

75
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.860
Don't mind if I do.

76
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.720
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Hazel.

77
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.050
Oh, hey, Hazel. How was your summer?

78
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.260
Were you with your
uncle at the slop farm?

79
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.660
If you mean volunteering at
the National Meat Association,

80
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.100
yeah, it was good.

81
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.520
What are you guys doing here?

82
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.720
You guys never come to the fair.

83
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.900
What happened to your arm?

84
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.270
Oh, my God, she ate
shit is what happened.

85
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.730
She ate literal shit? What the fuck?

86
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.900
- Mmm.
- Or did you get beat up again?

87
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.610
No, I just tripped and I...

88
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.620
Or were you jumped? Was it spy camp?

89
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.160
Did you go to juvie?

90
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.790
- Yeah, we went to juvie.
- Ladies and gentlemen...

91
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.405
- Oh, my God, it was juvie?
- ... it's time to get ready,

92
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.000
get wild, and get horny
for our very own Vikings!

93
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.830
Oh, my God, what did you do?

94
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.420
And the man who will lead us to victory

95
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.510
against the evil, maniacal,

96
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.880
shit-eating Huntington Ferrets,

97
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.300
let's hear it for Jeff!

98
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.970
Jeff! Have my babies!

99
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.680
Jeff, fill me with your seed!

100
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.680
I just don't get why
girls like guys like that.

101
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.480
It's like they're like dogs,
or pigs, or is there a...

102
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.000
What's the grossest animal?

103
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.020
Jeff, come sign my tits!

104
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.250
Eat my pussy!

105
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.130
That's right.

106
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.200
Oh, fuck. Uh, Hazel.

107
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.410
Gimme that. Josie, take this. Take this.

108
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.910
- Take this.
- No.

109
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.410
Really quick. This is the moment.

110
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.290
Stop yelling at me!

111
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.640
Could you give that back really quickly?

112
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.710
- Hey, Brittany.
- PJ.

113
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.420
I am loving all the...

114
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.170
holes in your pants.

115
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.370
Thanks.

116
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.300
You look like a little Dutch boy.

117
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.500
Thank you.

118
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.760
So, Britt... Can I call you Britt?

119
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.810
I prefer if you just called me my name.

120
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.310
- Britt-a-nay. Um, but...
- No, not that.

121
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.940
Brittany.

122
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.580
Are you thinking of riding the
Ferris wheel at all tonight?

123
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.940
I wasn't. I'm going
on the puke and duke.

124
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.140
I need to pull trig.

125
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.530
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

126
00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.740
I'm gonna say something crazy.

127
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.360
I think you could eat food,

128
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.950
digest it, let it marinate, poop it out.

129
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.280
Mmm, gross.

130
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.950
Maybe this? You want a bite of this?

131
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.250
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, this is fucking disgusting. Ugh.

132
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.120
You want a hot dog? We
could go get hot dogs.

133
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.420
Oh, I don't know.

134
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.790
Yeah, we could get the
bun and the ketchup.

135
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.920
- No bun. No.
- You gotta get the bun.

136
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.760
- Yes, you could.
- No.

137
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.800
No bun. Okay.

138
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.090
Um, Isabel.

139
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.390
Josie was just saying
something similar to me.

140
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.590
I don't think so.

141
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.220
I think so. It was really good.

142
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.740
It was super funny.

143
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.250
You're just so... You're
skinny too, as well.

144
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.690
I'm Josie, by the way, good evening.

145
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.450
Yeah, you're skinny...

146
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.910
You're real skinny minnie, aren't ya?

147
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.910
You probably should eat.

148
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.330
They're gonna send you to the
hospital with how skinny you are.

149
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.890
Uh-oh, call the doctor.
Skinny girl, I see.

150
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.580
Okay, do you guys want
any of our tickets?

151
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:55.810
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

152
00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.510
Fuck! Fuck!

153
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.510
I don't want to say
it, but we're fucked.

154
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.050
You know what? I'm good.

155
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.050
'Cause it's not gonna happen for me.

156
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.510
If it's not happening here,

157
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.260
then it's definitely not
happening at Emerson, okay?

158
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.480
I'm done trying to sow my damn oats.

159
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.560
- No.
- I'm packing up my vagina

160
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.150
and I'm fucking Matthieu.

161
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:17.610
That's the only hope for me.

162
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.150
- No.
- It's me and Matthieu, man.

163
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.570
And 'cause he's gay and fearless,

164
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.360
he's probably gonna fuck
me without protection.

165
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.570
Then I'm gonna get pregnant.

166
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:24.770
We're going to have to join a church.

167
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:25.950
He'll be the gay pastor.

168
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.530
My whole life's fucked!

169
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.370
And yeah, sure, his sermons are good,

170
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.120
but everybody knows he's fruity.

171
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.540
Everybody knows he's fucking fruity!

172
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.250
By the way, our son, Hezekiah, hates us

173
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.920
'cause he knows we're both closeted,

174
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.090
but we try to make it work
for him, but he's not happy.

175
00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.500
And yeah, guess what?

176
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.340
The deacon's fucking
the evangelist, man!

177
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.720
He's fucking the evangelist!

178
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.640
I don't wanna live like that.

179
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.470
Will you come and visit us on Sundays?

180
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.350
Please, will you come
and visit us on Sundays?

181
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.270
- Isabel.
- Leave me alone!

182
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:00.650
- Stop following me.
- Wait, shut up.

183
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:01.900
- What?
- Look.

184
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.780
- Don't touch me.
- Isabel, baby.

185
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.190
My teeny, tiny baby girl.

186
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.360
Why do you always have
to flirt with other women?

187
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.620
It doesn't count if
they're not in high school.

188
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:10.950
Especially Mrs. Reilly!

189
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.950
- Josie, offer her a ride.
- I don't think so.

190
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.150
Yes, come on.

191
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.580
... Irish Catholic.

192
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.150
And I'm regular Christian!

193
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.750
- Josie, ask her. Come on.
- PJ, stop.

194
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.630
You're hurting my head.

195
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.090
You're attacking me, and
it's giving me a migraine.

196
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.460
And it's giving me PTSD about all
the other times I've had migraines.

197
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.380
- Just do it now.
- No.

198
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.320
- Just go fucking ask her.
- No. Isabel, would you like a safety ride?

199
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:31.200
Isabel.

200
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.970
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God.

201
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:35.390
Isabel...

202
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:36.890
Get out of the car.

203
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.230
You can't tell me what to do.

204
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.100
- Yeah, no, he can't.
- Okay,

205
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.150
I'm sorry that I looked at Mrs. Reilly

206
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.280
and lightly grazed her
left tit, all right?

207
00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.530
Move, you prick!

208
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.570
Uh, excuse me, she said, "Move, prick."

209
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:50.770
Don't talk to me, you ugly bitch, okay?

210
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.490
I do not talk to girls in overalls.

211
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:54.865
- Hey.
- Okay, I might be ugly,

212
00:07:54.866 --> 00:07:55.866
but these aren't overalls.

213
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.250
Isabel, get out of the
freaking car! Get out!

214
00:07:58.450 --> 00:07:59.920
Get out! Come on.

215
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.195
- I feel like we should just drive.
- Drive.

216
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.380
- Drive.
- Let's just go.

217
00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:03.960
Please. You're being
really mean right now.

218
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.300
- He'll move.
- He's not moving.

219
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.500
He's gonna move.

220
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.840
- We're about to drive.
- Isabel.

221
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.840
- Drive. He'll move.
- Just drive. Josie, go.

222
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.300
- Three, two one...
- Pedal to the metal. Drive!

223
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.150
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

224
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.420
Jeff?

225
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.070
Jeff!

226
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.510
Are you... Are you okay?

227
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.560
When people move cars,
don't people move?

228
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.320
Jeffrey, I'm coming! I'm coming!

229
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.910
You're not alone. You're not alone.

230
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.450
- Back up! Back up!
- We didn't even do anything.

231
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.790
No, come here.

232
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.040
- Man down! Man down!
- You!

233
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.370
Oh, my God.

234
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.080
- I'm... I'm blacking out.
- No, stay with me.

235
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.380
We should go. Let's go.

236
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.840
- Let's go.
- Yeah. Okay.

237
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.420
Let's just kind of peel on out.

238
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.920
- Fine.
- What did you do to him?

239
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.840
Buckle it for me. Fuck!

240
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.180
You fucking cowards!

241
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.400
You better fucking run!

242
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.220
- I don't understand.
- What the fuck?

243
00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.480
They're not gonna get away with this!

244
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.150
Attention.

245
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.070
The library is out of use again.

246
00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.190
Huntington shot up our remaining books,

247
00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:13.950
so there will be no reading
again this year. Thank you.

248
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.870
Oh, Brittany was just
so cute last night.

249
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:21.040
Like, "No, I can't eat a hot dog.

250
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.870
I know I won't even digest it.

251
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:25.070
I have to throw up."

252
00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.090
And I was, like, "You can have it."

253
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.210
She's like, "No, not, just...

254
00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.810
Maybe, but not the bun."

255
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.820
Oh, it was just really sweet.

256
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.740
You had to be there.

257
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.880
I was there.

258
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.020
Are you serious?

259
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:40.730
I got "faggot number two" this time?

260
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.390
You're the sidekick, not me.

261
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.440
'Sup, Ted? How's the family?

262
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.460
Sick. Yeah, you know what to do.

263
00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.070
Thanks.

264
00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.570
Do you feel like people are looking
at us? Like, more than usual?

265
00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.240
I don't know. Did you period yourself?

266
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.510
Mmm... Mmm-mmm. Hey, Sylvie.

267
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.160
Hi.

268
00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:01.950
Holy shit. Are you guys okay?

269
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.500
What? Yeah.

270
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.080
- Why wouldn't we be okay?
- All right, kiddos.

271
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.040
Welcome back to class.

272
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.920
Hey! The prep club worked hard on those.

273
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.210
That belongs to the school.

274
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.090
Oh, cool. So, does your vagina.

275
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:13.340
Nice try, PJ,

276
00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.260
but my vagina belongs to the government.

277
00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.260
All right, check it out.

278
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.700
- Today I got a special lesson for all of you.
- Josie, so, how'd you do it?

279
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.070
Do what?

280
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:25.850
Holy shit. Is he okay?

281
00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.250
Hey, you good, man?

282
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.570
What the fuck?

283
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.860
- Yeah, okay, so...
- What the fuck?

284
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.060
Meanwhile, back at the ranch...

285
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.360
Okay, so, did he fight back?

286
00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.910
No, literally, how did
it go? Did he fight back?

287
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.660
- I hope you broke a bone.
- If you need a shoulder

288
00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.280
or anything, just let me know...

289
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.880
I heard you did something to
him, I just don't know what.

290
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.080
... and I'll totally let you lean on me.

291
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.120
No, but like honestly,
how did you do it?

292
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.830
Oh, my God. Annie, they went to juvie.

293
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:48.030
That's how, okay?

294
00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.790
Hey. Hey. Hey, you.

295
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:51.340
Overall bitch.

296
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.170
This is you.

297
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.130
God damn it, Jeff.

298
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:56.630
What the fuck?

299
00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:59.100
Hey, you couldn't make that
analogy with your fists?

300
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.970
Hello, this is Principal Meyers

301
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:04.890
with an important Huntington update.

302
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:06.520
So, listen to this girl.

303
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.610
Last night, outside the fair,

304
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.400
a Huntington player followed me home,

305
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.610
pinned me against my car
and punched me in the face.

306
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:17.610
And now my face is totally fucked.

307
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.870
- Fuck.
- We haven't faced the violence

308
00:11:19.871 --> 00:11:21.680
of Huntington for 20 years.

309
00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.200
They think they can get in our heads

310
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.410
by picking on our weak and defenseless.

311
00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.290
Well, we can't let them
break our spirit, folks.

312
00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:29.000
Keep your heads in the game.

313
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.200
They're gonna pork us!

314
00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.500
- We're fucked!
- I'm screwed.

315
00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:32.840
Hey. Hey, calm down just a little bit.

316
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.510
Oh, great. More violence.

317
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.700
Just what this school needs.

318
00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:38.340
Seriously, that's... that's it?

319
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.390
- That's class?
- Latte.

320
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:41.590
Get my shit.

321
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.350
Solid class.

322
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:45.950
Hey.

323
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.900
Josie, right?

324
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.420
I heard you, like, beat
up my boyfriend last night?

325
00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:57.400
Um, weren't you there?

326
00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.360
I heard you guys ate literal shit

327
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.740
- and killed girls in juvie.
- Really?

328
00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.200
Um, what did you think about that?

329
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.740
Excuse me.

330
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.460
Could the ugly, untalented gays

331
00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.420
please report to the principal's office?

332
00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.420
Guess that's you guys.

333
00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.050
Hello, Principal Meyers. First of
all, I want to say, God bless...

334
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.670
- Shut up. You know why you're here.
- I don't, actually...

335
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.380
For committing a crime against Jeff.

336
00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.840
Our quarterback and
the most good-looking,

337
00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.680
all-American, red-blooded, muscular
man this town has ever seen.

338
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.880
Sir, please, look in the mirror.

339
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.430
- Shush.
- Okay.

340
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:31.850
The homecoming game with
Huntington is nearly a month away.

341
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:33.325
Do you know how long we've
been working toward this?

342
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:34.980
- Yes.
- Yes. It's everywhere.

343
00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.420
- Twenty years.
- Couldn't be clearer.

344
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:37.470
I think I can explain.

345
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.690
I can explain.

346
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.740
Jeff is psychotic, and
he tried to murder us.

347
00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.240
Ha! Sure.

348
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.700
You're all victims, and
girls are always right. Right?

349
00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.040
Yeah, actually.

350
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.120
How come you can't buck up

351
00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.830
and learn to protect yourselves
without running somebody over?

352
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:54.000
Maybe it's because we're
small and he's giant.

353
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.750
So, we needed to use a little machinery.

354
00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.340
Did you ever think of that, sir?

355
00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.510
- Can we just explain ourselves?
- Maybe I should buy a gun.

356
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.840
Okay. What? What? Don't buy
a gun. Nobody said buy a gun.

357
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.850
- Can we just calm down, everybody.
- Zip it.

358
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:06.560
- You know what?
- What?

359
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.100
- I'm gonna expel you both.
- No!

360
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.680
- No! No!
- Yes! Yes!

361
00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.190
You have to understand that
this was a misunderstanding.

362
00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:17.460
- Really?
- We were just practicing...

363
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:20.590
for...

364
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.510
for our self-defense club.

365
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:30.620
Self-defense... What is that?

366
00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.080
- Uh...
- Is it like a fight club?

367
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.130
- Well, here's the thing...
- Yes! Yes!

368
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.090
- Uh...
- Yes! Yes!

369
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:38.420
A fight club.

370
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.920
Where we fuckin' beat
each other up and shit.

371
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.120
- No, we don't.
- Yes.

372
00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:43.380
No, we don't. Shut up.

373
00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.840
Okay, you know what?
I don't care. Fuck it!

374
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.220
- I don't care.
- You're over it, okay.

375
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.260
Yeah. You can beat the
shit out of each other

376
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.060
while you perform The Vagina Monologues.

377
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.770
Just stay in your lane until
you're munching beaver at Wesleyan.

378
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.600
Yes, sir.

379
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.940
I can't believe they're letting
you guys start a fight club.

380
00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.320
No, they're... they're not. We are not.

381
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.820
What are you talking
about? We're gonna do it.

382
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.020
We're doing it.

383
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.820
PJ, I wasn't being serious.

384
00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.410
Josie, did you see the way that
Isabel and Brittany were looking at us?

385
00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.200
Also, you heard the announcements.

386
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.410
Girls are terrified.

387
00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:13.120
It's perfect. They need this.

388
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.750
Okay, no. They need, like, mace, maybe.

389
00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.960
We can't do that, okay?
We'd be misleading them.

390
00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.210
Guys do that all the time, okay?

391
00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:21.410
That's the point of feminism.

392
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.760
That's not the point of feminism.

393
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.630
You also don't care about feminism.

394
00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:25.930
Your favorite show is Entourage.

395
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:27.470
You're missing the point!

396
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.470
I don't really think I am.
We don't know how to fight.

397
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.020
You guys probably fought girls in juvie.

398
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:32.810
No, we were lying about that, obviously.

399
00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:34.310
About juvie?

400
00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.150
- Yeah, I mean, what?
- Why would you lie to me?

401
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.560
You were the one who
said we went to juvie.

402
00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.980
I just didn't correct you.

403
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.280
Listen, self-defense is
instinctual common sense.

404
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:43.570
You try to punch me in the
face, I stop it from happening.

405
00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:45.740
Whatever. I don't care. It's easy.

406
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.990
Look, this is how we do this.

407
00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:49.410
Okay, we start with Taekwondo.

408
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:50.780
Which I've got covered.

409
00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.910
And then you guys can
move on to air punches.

410
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:54.110
Hub-bub-bub-bub.

411
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.580
Who do we know? Who do we know?

412
00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:56.830
I'll bring Stella-Rebecca.

413
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.380
You know Stella-Rebecca?

414
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.130
Stella-Rebecca who
models at car conventions

415
00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.250
- in Chicago on the weekends?
- Yeah, we're family friends.

416
00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:04.420
Okay, great. Well, then bring her.

417
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:07.260
- Josie.
- What?

418
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.760
- We're doing this.
- No.

419
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.470
Yeah. Listen to me.

420
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.220
We teach a bunch of girls
how to defend themselves

421
00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.230
against the evil, Huntington killers.

422
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:16.890
They are grateful to us.

423
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:19.440
We build a community, we bond,

424
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.690
we share, we connect.

425
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:24.690
We're punching each other,
adrenaline is flowing.

426
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.150
Next thing you know,

427
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:27.910
Isabel and Brittany are
kissing us on the mouths.

428
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.380
- Jeffrey!
- Josie...

429
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:32.490
Isabel knew your name.

430
00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:34.580
- Back from the dead.
- If we do this...

431
00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.790
- Mmm-hmm.
- Very big "if,"

432
00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:38.420
we just run the risk of becoming

433
00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.330
even bigger losers than
we already are right now.

434
00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:42.710
And I hate to break it to you,
but we're pretty big losers.

435
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.050
And that is the beauty.
That is the beauty of this.

436
00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.720
Because we are literally at the bottom.

437
00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:48.920
We're the lowest of the low.

438
00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.430
- Okay.
- We have nowhere to go but up.

439
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:53.560
Listen, I think this
is a good idea, okay?

440
00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.230
There's a serious lack of
female solidarity at this school.

441
00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.440
Not the point, Hazel. Not the point.

442
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.940
Yeah, I mean, we just felt like

443
00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.620
there's a serious lack of
female solidarity at this school.

444
00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:07.500
Anyways, totally come by. See you later.

445
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.490
What's your plan here?

446
00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:12.200
I don't need a plan.

447
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.380
My mom has a business.
All we have to do is yell.

448
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.670
Okay.

449
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:22.930
What's up, lads?

450
00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.130
What the fuck?

451
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.210
- These girls are ugly.
- Okay.

452
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.720
Where is Stella?

453
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.340
She was booked for a car convention.

454
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:31.970
What? It's a Monday.

455
00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:33.640
Um, maybe we should go

456
00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.965
before someone cool shows up?

457
00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:36.430
Before I die? Pick one.

458
00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:39.020
Hey, Hazel. Thanks for the invite.

459
00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:40.980
I love David Fincher.

460
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.520
- Oh, my God. Well...
- See?

461
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.530
I guess Sylvie's cute
if she lost her braces

462
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.110
and stopped huffing paint.

463
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:49.950
She'll never stop huffing paint.

464
00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.140
So, I thought we'd start...

465
00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:52.310
Um...

466
00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.220
- Okay.
- Sorry.

467
00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.410
All right.

468
00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:59.660
Listen up, you
cunt-sucking pieces of shit.

469
00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.420
Welcome to our fucking fight club.

470
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:03.250
Um, it's a self-defense club.

471
00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:04.590
It's not really, "Fight."

472
00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.170
So, as we know,
Huntington is on the prowl,

473
00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:09.880
and they're picking on the weak

474
00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.550
and defenseless, meaning all of you.

475
00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:15.260
So, we're gonna teach
you how to not take shit.

476
00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.430
We're gonna start with dropkicks,

477
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.730
tackling, little bit of knife play.

478
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.390
Then, punch-bucket,

479
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:23.400
which is when we throw you in a bucket

480
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.560
and we punch you until you bleed.

481
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.610
Before that, perhaps stretches,
icebreakers, and trust falls.

482
00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:30.820
Is that what happened to you in juvie?

483
00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.950
- Mmm. No. No.
- No.

484
00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.030
Juvie was way crazier.

485
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.120
One time, this girl's
punching me in the rain.

486
00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.240
Fall to my knees. It's muddy.

487
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.080
I get up. I'm blind.

488
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.520
Punch her right in
the middle of her face.

489
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.480
Broke her fuckin' nose.

490
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:48.350
Josie?

491
00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:49.520
Care to share?

492
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.150
Yeah, all right.

493
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:55.930
Juvie was insane.

494
00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:59.260
Once a girl tried to
kill me with rat poison,

495
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.240
so I took her outside and
I punched her till she died.

496
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:05.600
So, you killed a girl?

497
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.480
Uh, no.

498
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.650
Because the ambulance
came and revived her

499
00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:12.990
and we actually had a really
productive conversation

500
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:14.950
when she came back to life, so...

501
00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.780
Um, since Josie
literally killed a girl...

502
00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.580
She came back to life.

503
00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.250
Mmm. But I remember her being
dead for at least a couple minutes.

504
00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.250
Josie is gonna start by showing you all

505
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.420
how to effectively throw a solid punch.

506
00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.850
Josie, if you'll step forward.

507
00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:30.170
No, I don't wanna do that.

508
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:32.170
- What's the problem?
- There's no problem. I just...

509
00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:33.760
No, I'm just not gonna do it.

510
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.340
Come on, they wanna see the punch.

511
00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.510
- They don't wanna see it.
- They wanna see. Look at them.

512
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:38.850
They wanna see the punch.

513
00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.050
Who am I gonna punch?

514
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:41.310
Punch me. Just punch me.

515
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:42.980
- Punch you?
- Yeah, come on.

516
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:44.170
I can punch you.

517
00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.560
Yeah. I know how to take a punch.

518
00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.940
Something people would always say,

519
00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.140
"PJ knows how to take a punch."

520
00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.310
Come on up.

521
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:51.630
Oh!

522
00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.460
Oh, fuck!

523
00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.040
Will there an advisor for this club?

524
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.790
Because we'll be
suspended if there isn't.

525
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:05.870
Who is gonna be dumb
enough to endorse a club

526
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:07.930
where we punch each other in the face?

527
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.900
The Holocaust. It happened.

528
00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.590
Yes, it did.

529
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.680
But how? The seeds were sown
in the Treaty of Versailles,

530
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.600
which y'all are gonna reenact while
I do some little reading over here.

531
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.570
I mean, he's perfect.

532
00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:24.600
No.

533
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:25.890
- What?
- No.

534
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:27.480
Please.

535
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.230
Dude, we're not fucking
doing this. I broke your nose.

536
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.110
Yeah, and I've never had so
many girls look at me in my life.

537
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:32.400
Fuck! When did you show up?

538
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.900
Hey, guys.

539
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.450
I just wanted to say thank
you so much for last night.

540
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.490
It was just so great,
and I was thinking,

541
00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:41.280
like, if Huntington and
me were in an alleyway

542
00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.410
and they were coming at me with,
like, swords and, like, knives

543
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:46.200
and, like, guns and stuff,

544
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.420
and you taught me how to punch
like that, then I wouldn't die.

545
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.920
- That's so great, Sylvie.
- Okay.

546
00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.170
But, unfortunately,

547
00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:54.880
Josie doesn't want to
do the club anymore.

548
00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.670
What? Why?

549
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:57.870
I don't know.

550
00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.550
Why? It was just so empowering.

551
00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:00.840
What was empowering?

552
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.810
Oh, my God, hi. Um...

553
00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:06.060
Just, we have a fight
club. It was our fight club

554
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.190
for, um, female solidarity
at this school, which we lack.

555
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.750
Isabel, let's go.

556
00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:18.780
Hi, boo-boo.

557
00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.240
I'm so strong.

558
00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:24.930
I mean...

559
00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:32.330
Mr. G, G-man, G-dog.

560
00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:33.840
Great class today.

561
00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.840
Hey, uh, girl.

562
00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.340
Thanks for coming in today.

563
00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.630
We have to come in. It's class.

564
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.840
Try telling Dimitri Walker that.

565
00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.180
Little motherfucker came the first
week and I ain't seen him since.

566
00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:46.770
Dimitri Walker committed suicide

567
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.520
the first week of school, Mr. G.

568
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.020
Sure, he did.

569
00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:55.440
Anyways, um, we were wondering if
you wanted to be our club advisor.

570
00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.650
- What kind of club is that?
- It's a women's club.

571
00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:59.590
We talk about women's issues.

572
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.760
For example, periods,

573
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.830
declining egg count,

574
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.020
skirts...

575
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:07.240
Skirts?

576
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.120
But long ones. Long denim skirts.

577
00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.420
Feminism is what she's saying.
Feminism as a... as a whole.

578
00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.500
Why don't you just ask
one of the female teachers?

579
00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.090
Mmm. Thought about
that, but we hate them.

580
00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:18.240
- Makes sense.
- Yeah.

581
00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:19.840
Listen. I'm kind of,

582
00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.090
you know, retiling the bathroom.

583
00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.760
- Mmm-hmm.
- Uh, I gotta be at the co-op.

584
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.760
And I'm also dealing with
some relationship drama, so...

585
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.560
Back to the club,

586
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.440
maybe this will be a great way
to take your mind off of stuff.

587
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.150
Can I be honest? You're a man

588
00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.770
who's not coping with what's going on.

589
00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:36.230
- Yeah.
- You know what?

590
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.860
My mom did say I need
to pick up a hobby.

591
00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.070
And here's one thing

592
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.400
- my mom's always said to me.
- Mmm.

593
00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.530
Sometimes, when you have a new hobby,

594
00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:46.160
- don't show up.
- Yeah.

595
00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.490
It's, like, you can be our club advisor,

596
00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:50.410
- but you don't even come to the dang club.
- No.

597
00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.540
By the way, great way to be an ally.

598
00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:53.790
That's my favorite way to be an ally.

599
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:55.960
You just say you're doing something

600
00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.710
and then you don't do
any of those things.

601
00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:59.880
You know what I mean? You say,
"I support women." You don't.

602
00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.510
Don't come. Yeah.

603
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:05.360
You know what? I'll sign
off on your period club.

604
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:07.350
- Amazing.
- What?

605
00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:08.600
- Yeah.
- Really?

606
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.950
- Okay.
- So cool.

607
00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:17.770
How many girls go to this school, again?

608
00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:21.530
Oh, my God, and again,
they're all sixes at best.

609
00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:22.840
Hey, guys.

610
00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.570
Mmm. Well, at least
Stella-Rebecca is here.

611
00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.700
Are you stressed? Because I'm stressed.

612
00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.750
Hey, ladies.

613
00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.890
Let's get it popping
in this motherfucker.

614
00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:36.100
All right. Um...

615
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:38.390
Hello, everybody.

616
00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:40.420
Okay, excuse me.

617
00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:41.880
Sorry, I feel... Sorry.

618
00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.170
Um...

619
00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:48.400
Everybody, shut the fuck up!

620
00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:59.040
This isn't a little hangout, okay?

621
00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:03.490
Oh, it's not a sleepover, playtime.

622
00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.960
There are serious rules that
we need to establish, 'kay?

623
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.840
First...

624
00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.180
listen.

625
00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.680
Second,

626
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.430
be on time.

627
00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.000
Yeah.

628
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.810
Except for you. You
come whenever you want.

629
00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.920
What time is it?

630
00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.720
- 3:30.
- 3:30!

631
00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.400
Club starts at 3:15.

632
00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:32.990
Not 3:16.

633
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:36.600
Not 3:17,

634
00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:41.150
but the doors close at 3:15.

635
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:42.960
No exceptions.

636
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.610
I don't care if you're like...

637
00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:48.450
"Oh, but I had to go
to extra help for math

638
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:52.240
because I... I need to get a full ride

639
00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.790
because my mom lives in a trailer

640
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:56.040
and she loves her
boyfriend more than me."

641
00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.210
La, la, la. Blah, blah, blah.

642
00:23:58.410 --> 00:23:59.830
Shut up, okay?

643
00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:03.480
My dad left me, and
I'm incredibly punctual.

644
00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.390
Um, hey, guys. Come on in.

645
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:13.680
Nice.

646
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.640
Uh, we're just getting started here.

647
00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.330
So, um...

648
00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.020
Today I think we're gonna
start with some body contact.

649
00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.770
We're gonna do wrestling.

650
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:25.070
I think I need a volunteer.

651
00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:26.820
Brittany, you're close
to me. You wanna...

652
00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.900
I'm sorry. I thought we
weren't allowed to be late.

653
00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.320
- That's not true. It's about...
- Oh, that's about next week.

654
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.720
- Yeah, next week.
- So, the rules for next week.

655
00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:34.080
Don't be late.

656
00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.480
- But this week is good...
- Yeah. No worries.

657
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:36.580
... if you're late. Take it easy.

658
00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:37.805
Okay, I'm sorry. I
just want to make sure.

659
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:39.790
This is a self-defense class, right?

660
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:41.040
Where we can learn to protect ourselves

661
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.670
against, like, football players.

662
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:45.750
And Huntington? 'Cause,
um, they're gonna pork us.

663
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:48.170
They're gonna pork us.

664
00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:50.260
I thought we were fighting
each other for money.

665
00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.680
There's a cash prize, right?

666
00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.640
I thought this was to be part of, like,

667
00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.030
a local underprivileged
female community.

668
00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:59.850
My identity is completely
attached to hers,

669
00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:02.480
so I just kind of go wherever she goes.

670
00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.680
Everyone's here for a good reason.

671
00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:05.190
So, uh, you know, like...

672
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:08.780
- Why are we nitpicking reasons?
- Yeah. How about this?

673
00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.780
- Let's jump in. Right?
- Yeah. For sure.

674
00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.200
- Love that.
- Yeah.

675
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.300
- I'll go.
- Great. Yeah.

676
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:21.040
Hey, hey, hey, hey. hey.

677
00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.370
I don't know about this shit.

678
00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:24.790
What the hell? You didn't even warn me.

679
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:26.880
Okay, we didn't get warnings at juvie.

680
00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.300
- Look.
- We can take it slower.

681
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:29.710
- Okay.
- Maybe, yeah, try that.

682
00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:31.340
Take that route. Little slower.

683
00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.890
Look. You just use your natural
instincts, just come at me.

684
00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:35.150
Whatever you want, 'kay?

685
00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.310
Oh, fuck.

686
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:38.640
Okay.

687
00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.270
That's great. I say that we go again.

688
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:42.940
- Oh!
- Ow, fuck! My back.

689
00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.020
Oh, shit. Man, we gotta shut this down.

690
00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.610
We don't have to shut
it down. She's fine.

691
00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:48.230
- Are you fine? Are you okay?
- Yeah, she's okay.

692
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:50.150
- She's totally fine.
- Shut this shit down.

693
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:52.150
- No, wait, Mr. G.
- Shut this shit down.

694
00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:53.600
No, don't blow the whistle.
Don't blow the whistle.

695
00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:55.490
I know that,

696
00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:58.370
you know, this is a
little messy right now

697
00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:00.410
but, like, the only way

698
00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:03.850
that we can learn how to defend
ourselves is by teaching each other.

699
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.170
Huntington is coming.

700
00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.100
We need this.

701
00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:14.590
I know that things might seem scary,

702
00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.820
but that's okay, because...

703
00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:19.860
because...

704
00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:22.930
Because you're gonna be fucking pros.

705
00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:24.600
- Is what I was gonna say. Yes.
- Yeah.

706
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.020
- Right?
- Yes.

707
00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.270
Crystal, I'm thinking of you.

708
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:31.230
You are never gonna get
assaulted on your birthday again.

709
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:32.990
- Lucky number seven, okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

710
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:36.530
And I... I'm gonna finally
reverse-stalk my stalker.

711
00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:38.120
Yeah, absolutely.

712
00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.320
And for me,

713
00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.180
I'll be able to kill my stepdad.

714
00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:43.580
- Awesome.
- Okay.

715
00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:44.910
And if you believe in yourselves

716
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:47.210
and you believe in us
and then you trust us,

717
00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:49.290
I'm like, "Let's fucking do this!"

718
00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:50.750
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

719
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:52.880
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

720
00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.340
So good.

721
00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:56.840
Yeah! Yes!

722
00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.240
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

723
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.020
Yes! Yes, queen, slay!

724
00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.140
Yes! Yes!

725
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.480
Slay! Yeah!

726
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.220
Cool.

727
00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.110
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I'm just gonna go.

728
00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:16.320
Yeah, for sure.

729
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:28.180
Oh!

730
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:36.480
- Whenever you want.
- I will.

731
00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:42.660
Whoa!

732
00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.560
- So, don't do that. Don't do that.
- Don't do that, guys.

733
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.035
- That was not... Yeah.
- These things you don't do.

734
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.140
So, it's good to learn.

735
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:51.400
Yeah.

736
00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.530
Yeah, no, we'll just do
it. What you should do.

737
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:00.880
- Yeah, yeah. For sure.
- Yeah, yeah.

738
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:10.670
- Wanna go again?
- Yeah, why not?

739
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:12.060
Whoa.

740
00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.060
Good job.

741
00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.840
Yeah! Damn.

742
00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:39.150
Come on!

743
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:40.350
Yes!

744
00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:54.420
Yeah, okay!

745
00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.500
Nice. All right!

746
00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.170
Oh, my God! Yes!

747
00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:06.610
Keep it up, guys!

748
00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:09.430
Shake it off. Shake it off. Get back up.

749
00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.570
- Good work, guys.
- Yeah!

750
00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:24.320
Fight me off, PJ.

751
00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.130
Stop smiling, I'm kicking your ass.

752
00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.640
Hazel!

753
00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:00.030
You little bitch, it's actually working.

754
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:01.280
I told you.

755
00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.740
I know. I feel like if we keep it up,

756
00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.570
we can actually take
on Huntington, you guys.

757
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:07.330
No, if we keep it up,
we can put our fingers

758
00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.200
inside of each other. Grow up.

759
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.400
All right.

760
00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:11.910
You know, PJ,

761
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:13.790
I feel like people are
actually liking more than just

762
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:15.830
the hitting and the
tackling part of the club.

763
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:18.210
Yeah, I know. We're
empowering them. Duh.

764
00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:21.130
No, I mean, seriously, to
have a safe space like this,

765
00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:22.720
it means a lot to people,

766
00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.180
and I think that if we took
some time to spend a meeting

767
00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:26.930
and actually get to know these girls,

768
00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:29.430
like, it would be really important,

769
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:31.660
instead of just, like,
sweating on them and...

770
00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:39.270
Hazel, that is a
genuinely brilliant idea.

771
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:40.860
- Yeah.
- I love talking about my trauma.

772
00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:45.941
I literally jack off after
every single therapy session.

773
00:30:45.942 --> 00:30:49.160
- What?
- It just makes girls weirdly horny. It does.

774
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.410
- Don't say "girls." It's you.
- Bonjour.

775
00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:52.540
I just wanted to say

776
00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:54.790
I'm loving what I'm
hearing about the club.

777
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:56.350
It seems so supportive of women.

778
00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:58.500
Especially the hot ones.

779
00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.340
Yeah, well, all women are hot to me.

780
00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:02.300
Listen, it's really cute and everything,

781
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:07.300
but we're getting a little
close to the game now and, um...

782
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:08.640
I'm just a bit concerned

783
00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.760
it might be taking away
attention from our team.

784
00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:15.160
I think that's, like,
literally impossible to do.

785
00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:18.330
Okay.

786
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.650
So, we know that the
club has been a place

787
00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:26.700
where we can feel empowered physically,

788
00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.490
but we also thought it could be

789
00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:32.160
a safe space and a place
where we can open up

790
00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.680
and talk about our feelings.

791
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:37.430
Okay, so who's been raped?

792
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.560
Just, you know, raise your hand.

793
00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:43.520
Gray area stuff counts too.

794
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:51.650
Everybody knows the
situation with my stepdad.

795
00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:58.730
He's just obsessed with
Friday movie nights.

796
00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:02.620
I mean, God, I get it,
you're my new stepdad, but...

797
00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:04.420
fuck, whatever.

798
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.990
You know?

799
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:08.320
Every time I call the
police about my stalker,

800
00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.530
they tell me to fill out an online form.

801
00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:12.620
And then the form tells me to call,

802
00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.610
so I call and then they
say they can't get involved

803
00:32:14.611 --> 00:32:15.910
until he tries to kill me.

804
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:17.390
And he keeps saying he's going to...

805
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:19.330
but that doesn't count.

806
00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:21.420
So, it's just, like, annoying.

807
00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:22.850
Been there.

808
00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.250
We've all been there.

809
00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:28.050
Well, I've been assaulted,
like, a million times,

810
00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:30.340
but I'm more annoyed

811
00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:34.640
that everyone knows me for
being beautiful and popular

812
00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.730
and no one knows that I'm
actually smart and super driven.

813
00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:41.700
Like, I literally own a jewelry
business and no one talks about it!

814
00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:44.730
See?

815
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:47.360
Well, ever since my parents' divorce,

816
00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.320
my mom has been doing
this, like, midlife crisis.

817
00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:52.990
I don't know how that's really
sitting with me, you know?

818
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:54.910
It's been really, really dark.

819
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:56.910
This has just been really
meaningful to me to, like,

820
00:32:57.110 --> 00:33:01.420
get to know some new people who
actually want to, like, get to know me.

821
00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:02.782
I want to bring it back to Brittany

822
00:33:02.783 --> 00:33:03.930
- for one second.
- I can go next,

823
00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:06.020
if that's okay.

824
00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:11.970
I don't really like talking about juvie

825
00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:14.890
and everything that
happened this summer, um...

826
00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:18.060
You know, obviously, we get
a lot of props or whatever

827
00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:19.530
'cause people think it's so badass.

828
00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.350
But, really wasn't.

829
00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:26.160
I mean, unless you consider

830
00:33:26.161 --> 00:33:28.030
getting hazed horrifically
every single night,

831
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:30.360
like, badass. I mean, um,

832
00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.740
obviously, you know, we
had to survive the Tributes

833
00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.830
and, you know, I did have to, like,

834
00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:37.870
fight people basically
every single night.

835
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:41.080
People were betting on us
and we were given, like,

836
00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:44.540
shivs and rusty pocket
knives and splintered wood

837
00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.880
and, um, pipes as well.

838
00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.090
And, um, we had to just, like,
fight people, sometimes to the death.

839
00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:51.920
Um, and I still hear
their screams at night,

840
00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:55.280
um, and that guilt probably will,
like, always shackle me forever.

841
00:33:57.070 --> 00:34:00.390
I realize now, I don't have
to be that person anymore.

842
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:03.230
Like, I don't have to just let things

843
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:06.810
happen to me 'cause of you guys.

844
00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:09.820
And, um, I am, like, really grateful

845
00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.400
for what the club has become and...

846
00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.110
Um...

847
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:16.720
Just especially, you know,
from where we started and, uh...

848
00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:19.790
Yeah, sorry.

849
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:21.410
I feel like I kinda killed the vibe.

850
00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:22.660
I've never really,

851
00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:26.080
I guess, said that to
anyone before. Sorry.

852
00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.840
People wanna, like, wrap up maybe or...

853
00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.350
I'm going through a divorce.

854
00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:33.470
Whoo! That shit felt good to say.

855
00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:34.970
Ooh, I'll tell y'all,

856
00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:37.110
men... men need therapy.

857
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:39.720
Yeah.

858
00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.660
I think that's a good
place to maybe wrap up.

859
00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:54.130
- Hey.
- Hey.

860
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.010
Um...

861
00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:58.800
Thank you, um, for that.

862
00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:02.220
Um...

863
00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:06.830
I don't know what you're doing tomorrow,

864
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:11.210
but I was going to study for Mr.
G's women murdered in history test,

865
00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:13.610
if you wanna...

866
00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:18.150
Yeah.

867
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:20.450
Yeah, okay, sure.

868
00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:25.380
Mom?

869
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:33.420
Mom?

870
00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:38.820
Oh, hi, honey.

871
00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:40.510
What are you doing home so early?

872
00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:46.450
Uh...

873
00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:48.270
Are you kidding me?

874
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:51.940
I had a long day.

875
00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.980
Mrs. Callahan, can I have a snack?

876
00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:59.010
First club fundraiser.

877
00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:01.680
I'm so excited. Great turnout, right?

878
00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:04.100
Hello, ladies.

879
00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:05.600
Hi, Bill, Bob, Fred...

880
00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.730
I don't know why anyone
wants my old, dirty underwear.

881
00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:09.350
It's so weird.

882
00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:11.940
Hey, Britt, uh, don't let 'em
touch in between your toes.

883
00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:13.190
Thanks, PJ.

884
00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:14.900
Ah. We're havin' fun.

885
00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.490
We're selling panties.

886
00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:18.880
You know, Brittany said she'd
make me a custom bracelet.

887
00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:21.590
Very nice.

888
00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:22.910
Do you wanna, um, celebrate?

889
00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:24.720
We could get some chicken
on a stick tonight.

890
00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.760
Um, I can't. Uh...

891
00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.460
Isabel and I have plans, so...

892
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:35.670
You're hanging out with Isabel?

893
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:36.920
Yep.

894
00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.180
Fuck, you're fast. Oh, my God, okay.

895
00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:41.010
I have to keep up.

896
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:42.350
Hazel, what is wrong?

897
00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:43.720
Are you constipated or something?

898
00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.060
I'm fucking tired.

899
00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.390
My mom was up all night
fucking the meathead.

900
00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:49.350
What meathead? Hi. Underwear, cars.

901
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:50.770
- Thanks.
- You know, like, the guy.

902
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:52.330
He's like the crybaby.

903
00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:55.690
With the balls?

904
00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:58.090
He catches them and
he... he throws them?

905
00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.840
He's like the main guy.

906
00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:04.010
Jeff?

907
00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:06.200
Is your mom hooking up with Jeff?

908
00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.790
I just thought Jeff
might be her safe word.

909
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:10.460
Jeff is his name, you idiot.

910
00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:12.580
Just get the hot people confused, Jesus.

911
00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.280
I'm good.

912
00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:16.960
Looking good, Stella!

913
00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:19.460
Are you gonna tell her?

914
00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.760
Yeah, they said they
were in juvie this summer.

915
00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.160
Okay, are you sure
they're not in the system?

916
00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.310
But isn't every kid from
Rockbridge Falls sent there?

917
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:32.510
Hit me! Ow!

918
00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:36.170
Okay, yeah, Essex County. Any others?

919
00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.400
Got it. Thank you.

920
00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:47.990
Jeff!

921
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:57.340
No, yeah, but I thought
she was maybe dead.

922
00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:59.050
- Not good.
- That's not the best.

923
00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:02.130
- No. No, not great.
- That's not a great thing.

924
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:09.520
I wanted to...

925
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:12.180
I wanted to tell you that, um, I'm...

926
00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.120
I'm very glad that I joined the club.

927
00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:16.620
Me too.

928
00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:20.940
I think it's really impressive

929
00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:24.160
that you and PJ went through
everything that you did

930
00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:27.620
and now have decided
to help the rest of us.

931
00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:30.090
I mean even that story
you told the other day.

932
00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:33.330
You're really, really brave.

933
00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:34.750
No.

934
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:36.170
No. No, no.

935
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:39.500
Yes. I mean you almost killed a girl.

936
00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:40.700
You're...

937
00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:42.770
Yeah, you're...

938
00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:45.360
really, really brave.

939
00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:49.860
What?

940
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:56.500
Actually, Isabel, uh...

941
00:38:57.830 --> 00:38:59.440
- There's, um...
- Yeah?

942
00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.980
There's something you maybe should know.

943
00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:03.290
Uh...

944
00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:07.450
I mean it's pretty insane.

945
00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:09.340
Okay. What... what is it?

946
00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.340
I just, I...

947
00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.250
I heard Jeff is cheating on you.

948
00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.520
Wait...

949
00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:27.890
Wait, what?

950
00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.180
I... I... Sorry, I think I... I heard...

951
00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:36.270
Um, what? Um... Who...
who told you that?

952
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:41.150
Hazel told me that,
uh, he and Mrs. Callahan

953
00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:44.860
are at it, pretty
much, like, every night,

954
00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.740
like, constantly.

955
00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:51.870
I mean, just at it with each
other, which is pretty fucked up.

956
00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:54.950
Um, even though I guess
it's, technically, it's legal,

957
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:56.960
it's still just pretty nasty, uh...

958
00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:58.580
Oh.

959
00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:10.930
Thanks.

960
00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.890
Jeff so hungy. Hungy hungy, hungy.

961
00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:17.520
Jeff so hungy.

962
00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.740
Swoosh!

963
00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:25.150
What the fuck is this?

964
00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:26.350
Is there pineapple in this?

965
00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:28.610
We talked about this, Janice.

966
00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:29.920
Jeffrey's allergic to pineapple.

967
00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:34.340
Eat a bag of dicks.

968
00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:41.730
Well, I wasn't going to do
it, but this is the last straw.

969
00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.480
How was last night?

970
00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.640
Uh, bad, probably, I would say.

971
00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:57.840
Wait, really?

972
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:04.830
She's walking really fast.

973
00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:08.670
She usually walks a lot slower.

974
00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.450
Hi.

975
00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:14.970
Are you having sex with Mrs. Callahan?

976
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:20.160
Baby, you look so beautiful.

977
00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.330
Like, so fucking hot.
How... how are you?

978
00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:24.710
Bad. Are you having sex with her?

979
00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:26.400
I'm... I'm...

980
00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:29.380
helping her with her taxes.

981
00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:30.880
Aren't you in eighth grade algebra?

982
00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.840
I can't answer that question

983
00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.220
because I... I don't know how to read.

984
00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:35.510
She's asking you to your face!

985
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:37.060
Fuck, that usually works.

986
00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:39.890
Are you cheating on me again?

987
00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:43.100
Baby, no! No!

988
00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.480
No, why would... why would I do...

989
00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:47.110
That was one time with
your sister, just once,

990
00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:48.400
two, four times.

991
00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:51.320
No, I would never cheat
on you again, okay?

992
00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.410
I promise you I am
not sleeping with her.

993
00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:55.910
I literally saw you yesterday.

994
00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:57.530
Shut up, nerd! I fucked your mom!

995
00:41:57.730 --> 00:41:59.640
Mmm. Mmm.

996
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:01.660
Wait.

997
00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:04.460
- Yeah, we're done.
- Isabel...

998
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:09.880
I'm getting revenge.

999
00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.630
I'm gonna fuck up some football
players. And I'm buyin' a gun.

1000
00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:13.470
Hell yeah. I'll get my stepdad's.

1001
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:14.930
What about, like, egging?

1002
00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:16.430
Yeah, so we can make 'em
not refrigerated and smelly?

1003
00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.510
Ooh, we could cook 'em and be like...

1004
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:18.850
- "You're cooked."
- Yes. Yeah.

1005
00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:20.050
Or what about, like, a bomb?

1006
00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:24.730
Like a... like a super small bomb.

1007
00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:26.230
I mean, they're super easy to make,

1008
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:27.940
and I can just put it under his car,

1009
00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:29.170
and it can be a distraction.

1010
00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.670
Yeah, Hazel, let's do terrorism.

Sylvie, you can't just throw it.

1030
00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:34.760
You have to fucking jump with it.

1031
00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.570
- I'm trying.
- Okay, watch me. Just...

1032
00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:45.890
Damn, we're, uh... We're
really gonna scare them off.

1033
00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:47.640
Nice! Nice!

1034
00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.250
I think I'mma help
Isabel keep watch, so...

1035
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:52.980
Okay, well, don't get distracted,

1036
00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:55.840
'cause we could be fined,
like, $2 for this, so...

1037
00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:00.800
Thought you might want some company.

1038
00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:04.640
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1039
00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.310
It's nice everybody's here, like...

1040
00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:11.350
vandalizing...

1041
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:13.230
Jeff's house.

1042
00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:17.320
It is nice.

1043
00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:20.690
I, uh...

1044
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:23.280
Like, how are you doing?

1045
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:27.060
I mean, I think it's for the best.

1046
00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:31.190
But I did kind of miss
when he would touch my hair

1047
00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:33.460
and go, like,

1048
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:38.780
"Shiny, shiny, shiny." You know?

1049
00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:42.380
I wanted to tell you this before, but...

1050
00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.830
I really appreciated you fighting

1051
00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:48.640
and speaking loudly at my boyfriend.

1052
00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.920
I really value

1053
00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.770
when people use violence and
raise their voices for me.

1054
00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:57.810
It's actually one of my love languages.

1055
00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:00.940
- Is the other one gifts?
- The other one is gifts.

1056
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:03.800
Um, I know

1057
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.570
everything is, like,
really fucked up and...

1058
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:11.240
you still probably
miss Jeff, which I get,

1059
00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.610
but I just think

1060
00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:17.210
you deserve way better, Isabel.

1061
00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:22.070
'Kay, guys.

1062
00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:23.770
Let's make sure we return
or donate these, okay?

1063
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.760
Does anybody know
where the fuck Hazel is?

1064
00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.600
Like, 15 minutes?

1065
00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:35.380
Oh, fuck. Fuck! Fuck!

1066
00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.310
Okay. Um...

1067
00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:44.010
♪ I don't know what to do ♪
♪ And I'm always in the dark ♪

1068
00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:46.560
♪ We're living in a powder keg ♪
♪ And giving off sparks ♪

1069
00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:48.560
It's gonna blow!

1070
00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.660
Oh, wow, yeah, it's gonna blow, guys.

1071
00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:54.640
Oh, my God.

1072
00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:56.330
What the fuck?

1073
00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.780
Holy shit.

1074
00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:04.710
Oh, fuck, there's no door!

1075
00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:14.330
- Annie, Annie, back up!
- I'm going, I'm going!

1076
00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:15.530
Stop fucking yelling at me!

1077
00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:16.440
- I'm going!
- Fuck.

1078
00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:20.650
♪ A total eclipse of the heart ♪

1079
00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:24.690
Oh, fuck!

1080
00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:27.220
Can you listen to me for, like, once...

1081
00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.430
Ted! Ted-ay! Theodore!

1082
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:31.810
- You're awesome!
- No, you're awesome.

1083
00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:33.310
Great. What are we supposed to do now?

1084
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:35.520
Relax. No one knows it's us.

1085
00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:36.720
Hey, guys.

1086
00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:38.790
Great show last night.

1087
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.530
I don't know what you're talking about.

1088
00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:43.570
Oh, you don't. No, it's really all good.

1089
00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:45.840
Jeffrey needed a new car, anyway, so...

1090
00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:48.340
don't worry about it.

1091
00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:53.220
What's wrong, Josie?

1092
00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:55.720
You seem a little off.

1093
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:05.690
Your club is over.

1094
00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:07.610
You understand?

1095
00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:11.700
Good.

1096
00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.270
All right, well, some of us clearly

1097
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:15.890
have a different definition of egging,

1098
00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:18.860
but if we keep our mouths
shut, stay calm, we'll be fine.

1099
00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:20.290
They're gonna shut us down, aren't they?

1100
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.070
What?

1101
00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:23.740
No. We don't know that.

1102
00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:25.400
- What... Why...
- Principal Meyers will believe

1103
00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.160
whatever Jeff and Tim say.

1104
00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:28.880
I don't really see how
we recover from this.

1105
00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:31.130
Man...

1106
00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:33.140
Fuck.

1107
00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.750
You know, it's been real, guys.

1108
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:36.960
Okay, let's not jump to conclusions

1109
00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:39.170
with the goodbyes and...

1110
00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:41.060
I'm gonna miss you guys so much.

1111
00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:44.550
And like, at least we
went out with a bang.

1112
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:46.340
I mean, that was fucking insane!

1113
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:49.300
There was just, like, fire everywhere.

1114
00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.310
Wait. Stop.

1115
00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.600
We don't... Wait, no, we
don't know that for sure.

1116
00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:57.690
PJ, don't be sad it's
over. Be happy it happened.

1117
00:47:57.890 --> 00:48:00.400
All right, can everyone
calm the fuck down, please?

1118
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:03.120
The club is not over, Josie, right?

1119
00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:05.540
No matter what,

1120
00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:08.160
this club has brought me so much.

1121
00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:09.350
I feel...

1122
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:14.470
so much more powerful and, um...

1123
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:16.430
protected.

1124
00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:18.620
Me too.

1125
00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:20.130
- Great.
- Oh, my God, PJ.

1126
00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:21.960
Okay, I'm sorry that you didn't get

1127
00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:23.160
what you wanted out of this group,

1128
00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:25.010
but I think the rest of us did.

1129
00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.590
Oh. Good for fucking you, Hazel.

1130
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:28.930
I'm glad that you
finally wrote one email.

1131
00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:30.680
- Accomplished a lot.
- I actually did.

1132
00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.760
I practically ran this
club for you and Josie.

1133
00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.470
Hey, let's calm down, maybe.

1134
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:36.810
You really think that you're the
reason that we have this club?

1135
00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:38.060
The reason? No.

1136
00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:39.260
But I can tell everyone
that if you want.

1137
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:41.690
Hazel. Uh, hey, let's calm down, right?

1138
00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:43.270
You're really ungrateful.

1139
00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:45.320
You're so lucky that we even
let you be a part of this.

1140
00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.170
PJ, you're a liar.

1141
00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:53.830
Yeah, well, you have no friends,

1142
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:56.180
and a skank as a mom, so...

1143
00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:11.730
Hazel.

1144
00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:22.580
PJ...

1145
00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:25.960
This doesn't mean it wasn't worth it.

1146
00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:46.500
Hazel.

1147
00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:51.320
Whoa.

1148
00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:56.320
I love God.

1149
00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.660
Yes, same.

1150
00:50:07.790 --> 00:50:09.320
Yeah.

1151
00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.590
Oh, my God, I always
wanted one of these.

1152
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:17.120
But my mom says they hide your
figure and make you look ugly.

1153
00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.240
Um, you can borrow it if you want.

1154
00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:21.140
Like, as a joke or...

1155
00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:23.290
whatever.

1156
00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:24.490
Thanks.

1157
00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:25.660
Yeah.

1158
00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:34.180
Wow, you and PJ

1159
00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:36.140
really have been friends forever.

1160
00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:38.950
Oh, I mean, since the first grade, so...

1161
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:42.770
We had the same babysitter, Rhodes.

1162
00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:45.660
PJ called her Gay Yoda, but I
think she's kind of like a mentor.

1163
00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:52.630
Yeah, but you guys, like,
could not be more different.

1164
00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:54.630
She's so, like...

1165
00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:57.050
like...

1166
00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.240
You know?

1167
00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:00.440
- Yeah.
- And you're...

1168
00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:02.350
You're so, like...

1169
00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:11.230
- You know what I mean?
- No, yeah, I know.

1170
00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:16.320
Josie...

1171
00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:06.850
I'm tryna help your
jewelry business grow.

1172
00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:08.520
- Really?
- Yeah.

1173
00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:10.290
I don't know if I can hire you
because you're like a convict.

1174
00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:15.240
Wow.

1175
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:19.070
This is, um, a total shithole.

1176
00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:25.970
Kind of a mess. Sorry.

1177
00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:32.540
Well, I hear that if you hire a convict,

1178
00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:33.940
they give you a tax break.

1179
00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.930
I fucking hate Mr. G.

1180
00:52:40.130 --> 00:52:42.220
Everything he says is so pathetic.

1181
00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:44.430
Oh, yeah. I mean,

1182
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:46.930
I feel like he, like,
jerks off to a poster

1183
00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:50.020
of the 1999 Rockbridge team
every single night, so...

1184
00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:52.080
Literally the peak of his existence.

1185
00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:05.470
Like, what is the point
of this assignment?

1186
00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:11.000
Who is bell hooks and why do we care?

1187
00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.520
Oh, sorry, I'm just trying
to, like, study over here.

1188
00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:15.770
Watch out.

1189
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.160
What?

1190
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:30.200
Uh, nothing, I'm just...

1191
00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:34.480
I'm just concerned 'cause I'm, like...

1192
00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:39.110
Your wrists are so small, and
the pen is so heavy that I'm like,

1193
00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:41.530
- "Is she getting exhausted?"
- Mmm.

1194
00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:43.450
I'm surprised you can
even see what you're doing

1195
00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:44.740
with all the surface area

1196
00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:45.970
that yours are taking up.

1197
00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:48.080
Wow.

1198
00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:49.450
Must be a struggle for you to write.

1199
00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:51.040
Okay, does this hurt?

1200
00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:53.000
Actually, yeah, that does
hurt my tiny, delicate wrists.

1201
00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.750
Yeah, that was the
lightest tap of all time.

1202
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:56.210
- Can you feel that?
- Can't even feel that.

1203
00:53:56.410 --> 00:53:58.100
- Can't feel anything.
- Just like muscles in there.

1204
00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:08.110
Um...

1205
00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:09.700
Uh...

1206
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:14.160
PJ, I'm... I'm straight.

1207
00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:20.590
Oh.

1208
00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:24.380
Um...

1209
00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:29.870
Yeah. Um...

1210
00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:33.000
- I'm... I'm sorry if you misread anything.
- No, that's all...

1211
00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:35.980
It's all good. I shouldn't
have assumed anything.

1212
00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:54.700
Um...

1213
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.290
I wanted to tell you something.

1214
00:54:58.210 --> 00:54:59.980
What?

1215
00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:02.710
Like, something that
happened last night.

1216
00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:05.510
What happened?

1217
00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:08.220
With Isabel.

1218
00:55:12.550 --> 00:55:13.550
Wait.

1219
00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:18.020
Wait, seriously?

1220
00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:24.440
That's... that's amazing. That's...

1221
00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:28.300
Everybody,

1222
00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:31.060
- even the fucking losers...
- Even the fucking losers!

1223
00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:33.890
... make some noise!

1224
00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.440
I thought you were super Christian.

1225
00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:43.570
I know. I just like getting
caught up in the festivities.

1226
00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:45.360
All right, uh, so we're
gonna do the pep rally.

1227
00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:46.950
First up, cheerleaders.

1228
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:02.520
Football!

1229
00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:08.180
Whoo! Yeah, thank you, ladies. Ooh!

1230
00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:10.720
Thank you all for joining
us here today, folks.

1231
00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:12.760
There's been some

1232
00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:15.850
exciting stuff happening at
Rockbridge Falls recently.

1233
00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:17.050
Oh.

1234
00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:19.440
How many of you

1235
00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:23.440
know about that little
girl fight club that could?

1236
00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:26.820
Ay, there go my girls.

1237
00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:31.070
Well, do we have a surprise for you.

1238
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:34.410
We're gonna bring... Where is she?

1239
00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:36.720
Hazel down.

1240
00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:40.210
One of the founding members.

1241
00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:42.540
To show us everything
the club's taught her

1242
00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:45.050
in a fun little challenge.

1243
00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:49.380
- Let's go, Hazel!
- Go, Hazel!

1244
00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:52.240
- What is this?
- I... I don't know.

1245
00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:57.780
Hazel will be fighting Tucker,

1246
00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:00.540
the school's number one boxer.

1247
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:09.820
Wait, I thought I was
gonna be fighting PJ?

1248
00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:12.820
I know what you're thinking,
but don't be alarmed.

1249
00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:14.620
Girls can do anything
guys can do, right?

1250
00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:16.010
Yeah, kick his ass!

1251
00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:18.680
Ready?

1252
00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:20.580
- Fuck.
- Go.

1253
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:36.990
Oh, my God.

1254
00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:42.210
- You got this, Hazel.
- Come on, Hazel!

1255
00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:44.250
You got it.

1256
00:57:58.720 --> 00:57:59.760
Shit.

1257
00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:03.310
Whoo! Get him!

1258
00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:18.310
- The fuck are you doing?
- Is she, like,

1259
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:19.560
sort of winning or...

1260
00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:24.450
No, leave the skin
on his face, will you?

1261
00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:27.570
Fuck.

1262
00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:29.150
Oh. Oh, my God.

1263
00:58:29.350 --> 00:58:30.860
I know what you're thinking.

1264
00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:35.340
You may be wondering how a
girl under the training of...

1265
00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:39.540
of two juvie convicted killers

1266
00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:43.080
can't even stand up for herself
against a regular old guy.

1267
00:58:45.070 --> 00:58:47.390
Well, truth is, they...

1268
00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:51.630
they didn't go to juvie.

1269
00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:53.920
No.

1270
00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:57.450
There's no record of them there.

1271
00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:00.390
And according to Hazel...

1272
00:59:02.830 --> 00:59:04.270
... they never fought anyone at all.

1273
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:06.270
And you know what else?

1274
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:09.920
They didn't start the
club to empower women.

1275
00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:13.950
They did it to fuck cheerleaders.

1276
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:19.010
What is wrong with you?

1277
00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:23.220
It is such a shame.

1278
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:27.670
We were really rooting for you girls.

1279
00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:31.210
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

1280
00:59:31.410 --> 00:59:32.880
Okay.

1281
00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:35.130
- Thank you for attending...
- Hazel!

1282
00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:36.870
- ... today's pep rally. Go Vikings! Fuck Huntington!
- Is she okay?

1283
00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:38.180
- Hazel!
- Whoo!

1284
00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:39.900
- Yes!
- Yes!

1285
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:49.500
Is that true?

1286
00:59:50.370 --> 00:59:51.980
That's why you started this?

1287
00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:54.650
No, no, no.

1288
00:59:54.850 --> 00:59:56.360
Not... not entirely.

1289
00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:58.070
Not entire... Okay.

1290
00:59:58.270 --> 01:00:01.080
Listen guys. It doesn't matter...

1291
01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.720
the reason that we started
this, right? Like...

1292
01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.040
The point of the club

1293
01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:09.960
is that we all learn
from each other, right?

1294
01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:13.090
And... and we had a
great time doing it and...

1295
01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:14.460
I thought this club was for sisterhood,

1296
01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:16.920
but it was for your
own selfish interests?

1297
01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.690
This is the second wave all over again.

1298
01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:26.060
Isabel, please, please, wait.

1299
01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:28.520
PJ made me do this. I didn't want to.

1300
01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:29.750
I would never want to do this.

1301
01:00:33.370 --> 01:00:34.920
You're pathetic, Josie.

1302
01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.040
Mr. G, we're really sorry, we...

1303
01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.290
All right, look.

1304
01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:51.670
You know what? I'm not a fuckin' idiot.

1305
01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:52.960
I just look like this.

1306
01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.210
I wasn't doin' this
shit as a distraction.

1307
01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:58.130
I actually was doin' this shit
'cause I actually liked y'all group

1308
01:00:58.330 --> 01:00:59.380
and what y'all stood for.

1309
01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:02.050
- Wait, we can explain.
- I trusted you two

1310
01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:04.390
and y'all exploited my solidarity.

1311
01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:07.230
I played the role of an amazin' ally.

1312
01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:08.600
Is this about the time I said

1313
01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.740
Amelia Earhart was a fake hero?

1314
01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:13.150
Because it's true.

1315
01:01:13.350 --> 01:01:16.400
Many a guy fly planes without crashing,

1316
01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.600
but you never hear about them.

1317
01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:19.820
And then it's like,

1318
01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:22.200
"Oh, it's so hard to be a girl."

1319
01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:23.870
"We, like, make less money."

1320
01:01:24.070 --> 01:01:25.910
"We had to lose our last names."

1321
01:01:26.110 --> 01:01:27.370
"I love you."

1322
01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:29.330
"I want to be with you
for the rest of our lives."

1323
01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:32.960
"Oh, I love the mint green
backsplash in the kitchen."

1324
01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.250
And all of a sudden,

1325
01:01:34.450 --> 01:01:36.130
you leave me for a
motherfucker named Tony

1326
01:01:36.330 --> 01:01:39.010
and suddenly, the fucking
kitchen is lime green.

1327
01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:40.470
I think...

1328
01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:42.970
Yeah, I think that moved away from us.

1329
01:01:43.170 --> 01:01:45.470
Oh, you look confused, like
how I'm confused right now,

1330
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:48.220
on how you created a fucking
fight club to get some cooch.

1331
01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:51.480
And for what? Y'all ain't even
know how to work that thing.

1332
01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:53.440
And I know y'all ain't
tickling the pearl,

1333
01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:54.690
you know what I'm talking about?

1334
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:55.940
You know what I mean? Caressing the back

1335
01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:57.900
of that neck and all type of...

1336
01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:59.490
Sorry, I just don't
know if you're supposed

1337
01:01:59.491 --> 01:02:00.860
to be talking to us like that.

1338
01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:02.450
Just, like, as a teacher...

1339
01:02:02.650 --> 01:02:04.120
Man, I knew women were evil.

1340
01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:07.220
Motherfuckers always tellin'
me like, "No, that's not true."

1341
01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:10.260
But time and time again...

1342
01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:17.800
Women ain't nothing
but the fuckin' devil.

1343
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.090
I can't fuckin' believe Hazel.

1344
01:02:21.290 --> 01:02:24.360
Okay, well, you were pretty
horrible to her yesterday.

1345
01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:30.220
I'm sorry, what? This
is... this is my fault?

1346
01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:33.560
I'm not the one who
put Isabel on a rampage.

1347
01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.860
Sorry, what does that
have to do with anything?

1348
01:02:36.050 --> 01:02:38.400
If Isabel wasn't so
desperate to get revenge,

1349
01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.110
then we wouldn't have
blown up Jeff's car

1350
01:02:40.310 --> 01:02:41.900
and then he wouldn't be so upset

1351
01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.240
and then whatever the fuck just
happened would not have happened.

1352
01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:47.280
Okay, so all of the blame
just goes on me then?

1353
01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:49.870
Like, none of this can be
traced back to you at all?

1354
01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:52.930
Well, I mean, yeah, it was your
idea to start the whole club.

1355
01:02:54.310 --> 01:02:56.630
I didn't want to do
this from the beginning.

1356
01:02:56.830 --> 01:02:58.710
You know that.

1357
01:02:58.910 --> 01:03:01.800
I just followed your lead like an idiot.

1358
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.630
You followed my lead when
you created that insane story

1359
01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:08.390
about girls betting on you to
fight other girls with shivs.

1360
01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:11.270
You're just mad because I did this.

1361
01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:14.350
I... I... I got to be
with Isabel on my own.

1362
01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:15.810
Without you.

1363
01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:17.560
No, you never would have
talked to her without me,

1364
01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.110
ever.

1365
01:03:19.310 --> 01:03:20.780
I'm the one who made it happen for you.

1366
01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:25.780
You know what's so funny
about this whole fucking thing,

1367
01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:27.110
all your little schemes,

1368
01:03:27.310 --> 01:03:30.160
all your, "Oh, we'll have our year

1369
01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:33.450
and we'll fuck so many
girls," and whatever?

1370
01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:37.920
Is that you're the only
one who didn't do anything.

1371
01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.290
Yeah, well, that's 'cause
Brittany's straight, so...

1372
01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:41.960
Yeah, no, shit, she's straight.

1373
01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.510
Does it even matter?

1374
01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:46.720
Do you even care? Do
you actually like her?

1375
01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.180
Do you care about anyone
other than yourself?

1376
01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:50.600
Just find some other girl

1377
01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:52.910
to fucking jack off to
and do nothing about.

1378
01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:00.160
Cool. Yeah, I will.

1379
01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:05.500
PJ.

1380
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:49.170
- Ted?
- Mmm-mmm-mmm.

1381
01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:51.340
Ted.

1382
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.800
Ted!

1383
01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:58.210
Ted!

1384
01:06:40.410 --> 01:06:41.985
Josie, what the hell?

1385
01:06:45.290 --> 01:06:47.410
Why... why... why you
look like a scared puppy?

1386
01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:50.990
Hey, Rhodes.

1387
01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:52.500
Do you have a minute to talk?

1388
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:55.200
If you don't wanna borrow firearms,

1389
01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.050
- then why are you here?
- Um...

1390
01:06:57.930 --> 01:06:59.200
Like, for advice?

1391
01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.200
I'm not your Gay Yoda, Josie.

1392
01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.460
You're too old for this shit.

1393
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:05.920
Girl, when I was in high school,

1394
01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:08.590
people found out I was gay,
nobody wanted to be my friend.

1395
01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:09.880
And back then it was worse

1396
01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.760
because they hated
you just for being gay.

1397
01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.880
Not for being gay and untalented.

1398
01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.760
Mmm.

1399
01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.640
Sorry, people didn't know you were gay?

1400
01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.740
Girl, I wore a weave back then, okay?

1401
01:07:21.450 --> 01:07:22.600
And I used to say,

1402
01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:23.980
"Hey, girl. Hey... "

1403
01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:25.390
Look, that's not the point.

1404
01:07:25.590 --> 01:07:26.590
You want some advice?

1405
01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.360
Invest in yourself,

1406
01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:30.150
teach people to fear
you instead of love you.

1407
01:07:30.350 --> 01:07:33.320
I don't wanna, like, deny
your advice, obviously.

1408
01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:34.650
I just, um...

1409
01:07:34.850 --> 01:07:36.990
PJ and I are actually
in a fight right now.

1410
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:38.410
So, like...

1411
01:07:38.610 --> 01:07:40.160
Like, that's the advice that I need.

1412
01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:43.370
I never had many friends,
and that's... that's sad.

1413
01:07:43.570 --> 01:07:45.790
And as I've gotten old in this world,

1414
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:47.600
it's just gotten more sad.

1415
01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.420
Okay, um...

1416
01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:53.300
I think I'm just gonna go to the game

1417
01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:55.300
and then work it out with PJ there.

1418
01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:56.500
I wouldn't do that.

1419
01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:57.670
Why not?

1420
01:07:57.830 --> 01:07:59.680
- It's with Huntington, right?
- Yeah.

1421
01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:02.012
Well, I'm guessing they've
been fucking people up

1422
01:08:02.013 --> 01:08:03.013
for the past month, right?

1423
01:08:03.014 --> 01:08:05.390
- Yeah.
- So, they're violent.

1424
01:08:05.590 --> 01:08:06.850
What do you think's
gonna happen tonight?

1425
01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:08.830
I don't know. Football?

1426
01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:11.900
Game? Tackle?

1427
01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:13.130
Oh, girl.

1428
01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.700
There is a 50-year rivalry going on.

1429
01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:18.800
They always fuck up some unlucky player.

1430
01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:21.660
How you don't know...

1431
01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:24.500
In '77, they burned him
at a stake with his dog.

1432
01:08:24.690 --> 01:08:27.670
In '92, they drowned him
in a giant kiddie pool.

1433
01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:30.790
And in '03, they pulled
his body apart with horses.

1434
01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:32.170
It's called quartering.

1435
01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:33.710
I know... I know what it's called.

1436
01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:35.840
So, tonight, I'm stayin' inside

1437
01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.380
and double boltin' those doors.

1438
01:08:42.170 --> 01:08:44.350
- If you ever grab a...
- Nah, I don't care.

1439
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:47.480
I didn't understand a
word of that, I'm so sorry.

♪ I had one of those days ♪

1441
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:56.630

1442

1443
01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:16.400
Just go. Go, just, go. I don't wanna go.

1444
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:19.760
Oh, my God.

1445
01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:21.930
- Hey.
- How did you find me?

1446
01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:23.800
Why are you breathing so heavy?

1447
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.390
Okay. I know we're not in
a great place right now...

1448
01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:28.770
Yeah, because I'm pissed.
I'm fuckin' pissed.

1449
01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:31.150
Okay, well, I just still
think we need to talk

1450
01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:33.060
about everything that's, like, going on.

1451
01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:35.270
Yeah, cool, well, I
don't wanna hear it, so...

1452
01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:37.360
Okay, maybe you should reconsider

1453
01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.950
because I saw Rhodes,
she says hi, by the way.

1454
01:09:40.150 --> 01:09:42.320
She said this Huntington shit's
way darker than we thought.

1455
01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:45.120
Apparently, every time
Huntington plays Rockbridge,

1456
01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:47.330
they try to kill a player and his pets.

1457
01:09:47.530 --> 01:09:48.620
The pets?

1458
01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:50.620
It's bloodlust, man.
That's not the point.

1459
01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:51.870
Sounds like I should get

1460
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:53.070
- the fuck out of here now. Okay?
- No.

1461
01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:54.420
PJ, seriously, come on.

1462
01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:55.880
We need to get the club back together,

1463
01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.550
so we can save them.

1464
01:09:58.750 --> 01:09:59.750
What?

1465
01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:04.180
Sorry, you're saying
you want me and then you

1466
01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:06.720
and then all of the
girls that fuckin' hate us

1467
01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:09.930
to get together and save
some fucking football player,

1468
01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:11.350
who we hate?

1469
01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:13.060
Circle of bad vibes.

1470
01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:14.690
Okay, well, obviously, why
would you lay it out like that?

1471
01:10:14.890 --> 01:10:15.890
Because it sounds insane.

1472
01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:17.730
'Cause it is. Why would we do that?

1473
01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:20.960
Because we made these girls trust
us and then we humiliated them.

1474
01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:25.490
They deserve a shot at showing everybody

1475
01:10:25.690 --> 01:10:27.120
what they know, what they learned,

1476
01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:28.680
how fucking cool they are.

1477
01:10:29.850 --> 01:10:31.510
Let's do this for the club.

1478
01:10:32.850 --> 01:10:33.850
What do you say?

1479
01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:37.040
Can we save the damn day?

1480
01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:41.300
Wow.

1481
01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:42.500
Pulling out the necklace

1482
01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:44.530
- in the final fuckin' hour.
- Well...

1483
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:48.030
Yeah.

1484
01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:52.270
Mmm. Nice.

1485
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:55.650
Rockbridge, this is the most
important day of your life.

1486
01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:58.730
Forget your wedding,
forget your funeral,

1487
01:10:58.930 --> 01:11:00.480
fuck your bar mitzvah.

1488
01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:02.400
This is what matters.

1489
01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:05.360
Gameday, let's do this!

1490
01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:08.720
- Let's go, Vikings!
- We're almost there.

1491
01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:15.000
Okay, first off, PJ has
something to say to Hazel, so...

1492
01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.840
The apology. Do the apology.
Do the apology, instead.

1493
01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:19.460
Okay.

1494
01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:22.060
I'm sorry that I
called your mom a skank.

1495
01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:26.840
And I'm sorry

1496
01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:30.720
for saying that you have
no friends really loud

1497
01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:32.640
in front of all of your friends.

1498
01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:36.330
And I'm sorry for being an
asshole a lot of the time.

1499
01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:40.230
Most of the... All of the time.

1500
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:43.740
And I do think that it's
nice you always take notes

1501
01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:48.170
and then you type them up
and email them to everyone...

1502
01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:52.550
and I really appreciate it.

1503
01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:57.140
Do you forgive me?

1504
01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.210
Yes.

1505
01:12:01.410 --> 01:12:02.800
I don't want to interrupt
this gorgeous moment

1506
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.590
but we don't have time now

1507
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:07.220
because I got information
from a very confidential source

1508
01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:08.890
that Huntington is trying to kill

1509
01:12:09.090 --> 01:12:10.260
someone on this team tonight.

1510
01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:11.460
What are you even talking about, Josie?

1511
01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:12.720
Nobody's even over there.

1512
01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:14.640
Oh, my God, nobody is even over there.

1513
01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:16.390
Well, that is obviously a red flag.

1514
01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:18.810
Are we not reading that as
a red flag? That's crazy.

1515
01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:20.940
- What?
- Please, Annie.

1516
01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:22.480
Even though you're a Black Republican,

1517
01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:24.820
you are the smartest
out of all of us, okay?

1518
01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:26.820
I mean, obviously I know that.
You think I don't know that?

1519
01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:28.820
Then help us figure this out.

1520
01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:31.490
We need to stop the game.
We need to save them.

1521
01:12:31.690 --> 01:12:33.890
Wait, wait, hang on. Hazel...

1522
01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:36.760
we need a distraction.

1523
01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.250
Oh, now you want a bomb.

1530
01:12:54.090 --> 01:12:55.970
I know you really
must hate me right now,

1531
01:12:56.170 --> 01:12:57.480
but the club needs you.

1532
01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:58.730
To what? Have sex with them?

1533
01:12:58.930 --> 01:13:01.020
Guys, we really, really need you. We do.

1534
01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:02.820
In your fucking dreams, PJ.

1535
01:13:03.010 --> 01:13:04.580
Which you don't deserve to have.

1536
01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:07.070
When you sleep,

1537
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:10.030
- it should be, like... Total darkness.
- Rockbridge, are you ready?

1538
01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:11.950
- Oh, fuck.
- Wow, okay.

1539
01:13:12.150 --> 01:13:13.150
Okay, wait, seriously,

1540
01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:14.540
maybe if you just listened to us.

1541
01:13:14.730 --> 01:13:16.160
- Just listen to us. Whoa!
- Brittany.

1542
01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.790
- Here comes your team!
- Isabel.

1543
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:20.920
I wouldn't be asking you
if this wasn't important!

1544
01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:22.380
We don't have time for this.

1545
01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:24.130
- Josie, come on.
- Hazel!

1546
01:13:24.330 --> 01:13:25.605
- Okay, now that you're all...
- Ugh. Uh...

1547
01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:26.800
... warmed up, I want you guys...

1548
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.170
Is it the red wire?

1549
01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:30.550
Shit, or is it the yellow?

1550
01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:32.010
... Shawshank your way out.

1551
01:13:32.210 --> 01:13:33.410
- Put your hands together...
- You got this, Jeff.

1552
01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:34.510
- ... and shake your tanks.
- You got it!

1553
01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:37.740
Hazel! It's starting!

1554
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:40.640
Jeff!

1555
01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:42.860
Jeff! Eat my pussy!

1556
01:13:43.050 --> 01:13:44.060
Come on, come on!

1557
01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:46.820
Jeff! Jeff! Jeff!

1558
01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:49.190
- Hurry, Hazel!
- It's gonna blow.

1559
01:13:50.770 --> 01:13:52.160
- Hazel, come on!
- Hazel!

1560
01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.620
Hazel, come on!

1561
01:13:58.850 --> 01:14:00.750
- Hazel, it's not working.
- Hazel, it's not going.

1562
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:02.210
- Oh, no.
- Fuck. Fucking...

1563
01:14:02.410 --> 01:14:03.650
- Maybe turn it off...
- Maybe hit it?

1564
01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:04.700
No. Give me space. Stop.

1565
01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:06.020
Turn it off and then back on.

1566
01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:07.440
Jeff!

1567
01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:11.380
I want you to rub

1568
01:14:11.381 --> 01:14:13.570
Vicks VapoRub on your tanks

1569
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:16.970
and dance around like the
fruitbats that you are!

1570
01:14:17.170 --> 01:14:20.100
Okay, plan B. We need to get
the cheerleaders to make out.

1571
01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:21.730
Wait, okay, which
cheerleaders do you think?

1572
01:14:21.930 --> 01:14:24.270
It's a distraction.
We need a distraction.

1573
01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:32.570
- Guys.
- Hey, guys.

1574
01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:33.860
Guys, kiss each other.

1575
01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:35.120
Make out. Make out with each other!

1576
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:36.340
We need to delay the game.

1577
01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:40.930
Guys! Make out with each other!

1578
01:14:45.850 --> 01:14:48.630
Everyone, get your guns
out, hide your children

1579
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:51.440
because here comes Huntington.

1580
01:14:58.410 --> 01:15:00.220
- Fuck you! Bitch!
- What the frick is up?

1581
01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:02.100
- Yeah! Get back!
- Yeah! Wake up, pussy!

1582
01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:03.730
Hold me back!

1583
01:15:03.930 --> 01:15:05.850
You're so lucky!
You're so fucking lucky.

1584
01:15:06.050 --> 01:15:08.360
Hazel! Hazel! Hazel!

1585
01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:09.560
What do we do?

1586
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:13.490
Look, look, look.

1587
01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:31.940
Oh, wait. I'm gay.

1588
01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.940
Okay, yeah, I'm not.

1589
01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:39.010
I just like gay porn.

1590
01:15:39.210 --> 01:15:40.820
This is nothing like porn at all.

1591
01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:43.910
Wait.

1592
01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:46.650
Is porn even real?

1593
01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:03.040
Can we cut the gay shit and
get this show on the road?

1594
01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:08.250
I came here for some good man-on-man
grappling and slapping football!

1595
01:16:08.450 --> 01:16:10.960
Can everybody stop
looking at the dyke parade?

1596
01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:15.840
Who do I have to blow to get
this game started already?

1597
01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:19.300
- Yes!
- Now make 'em eat a bag of urine cakes.

1598
01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:21.930
Look, I found empty
barrels of pineapple juice.

1599
01:16:22.130 --> 01:16:24.060
There is pineapple here.

1600
01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:25.910
So, they're gonna poison Jeff then.

1601
01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:28.230
Where the fuck is it?

1602
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:29.860
Fuck, I'm thinking really quick.

1603
01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:31.610
What if it's in their mouths
and they're swishing it around

1604
01:16:31.810 --> 01:16:33.690
and then they're gonna
spit it out mid-game?

1605
01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:35.150
- What?
- I hate to say it,

1606
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:36.650
but it might have something
to do with their semen.

1607
01:16:36.850 --> 01:16:39.200
Obviously, it does not.
What is wrong with you?

1608
01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:40.700
They kissed on the mouth.

1609
01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:43.080
- With tongue.
- As a distraction,

1610
01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:45.750
and we can do it again
if people are asking.

1611
01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:47.750
- Wait, when was this?
- The bomb didn't work,

1612
01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:49.330
and there was no other distractions!

1613
01:16:49.530 --> 01:16:50.980
- Yeah, there was...
- And because we were...

1614
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:52.750
- They're gonna spray the field.
- What?

1615
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:54.630
- Okay, we're gonna have to run.
- No!

1616
01:16:54.730 --> 01:16:55.774
We're gonna have to run.

1617
01:16:55.775 --> 01:16:56.840
- We're gonna have to run.
- We can't run. No!

1618
01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.050
No!

1619
01:16:58.250 --> 01:16:59.630
- Oh, my asthma.
- No, please!

1620
01:16:59.830 --> 01:17:00.830
You don't have asthma.

1621
01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:02.640
I feel like I have asthma now!

1622
01:17:05.570 --> 01:17:07.350
PJ! Cover the sprinklers.

1623
01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:08.550
I got it.

1624
01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:14.350
Oh, fuck!

1625
01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.320
Get back here, you fuckin' weasel!

1626
01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:53.460
I'm sorry.

1627
01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:37.020
You saved me.

1628
01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:40.310
You're... you're welcome?

1629
01:19:42.650 --> 01:19:43.730
Oh, no.

1630
01:19:44.690 --> 01:19:46.530
- I... Would...
- Mmm-mmm. Uh-uh.

1631
01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:49.740
Are you okay?

1632
01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:51.570
Yeah.

1633
01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:53.730
- Whoa.
- Hazel!

1634
01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.390
- Hazel! Hazel! Look out!
- Hey.

1635
01:20:24.730 --> 01:20:25.800
It's pineapple juice!

1636
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.380
It's pineapple juice!

1637
01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:28.780
- Turn it off! Turn it off!
- 'Scuse me.

1638
01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:31.890
Turn it off! Please just turn it off!

1639
01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:46.180
Yes.

1640
01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.530
Yes!

1641
01:20:48.730 --> 01:20:50.990
Yes, this is the Viking way!

1642
01:20:51.190 --> 01:20:53.010
Yes, thank you, thank you.

1643
01:20:53.890 --> 01:20:54.930
You did it.

1644
01:20:56.050 --> 01:20:57.710
You fucking saved me.

1645
01:20:57.910 --> 01:21:01.020
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1646
01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:06.060
Thanks.

1647
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:16.910
- What is...
- I mean...

1648
01:21:17.090 --> 01:21:19.100
- Okay.
- I guess we did it.

1649
01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:20.690
We did that shit!

1650
01:21:20.890 --> 01:21:21.890
I mean...

1651
01:21:21.970 --> 01:21:22.970
Really proud of you.

1652
01:21:24.210 --> 01:21:25.830
I'm proud of us.

1653
01:21:30.670 --> 01:21:32.130
I do wanna say, um,

1654
01:21:33.170 --> 01:21:35.200
I feel like you killed that guy.

1655
01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.870
Oh, yeah. I mean, we killed...

1656
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:38.070
I think we killed...

1657
01:21:38.150 --> 01:21:39.910
- You killed that guy...
- No.

1658
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:42.670
- Yeah, he's dead. That's dead.
- No. Oh, my God.

1659
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:44.350
Yeah, we killed a couple. We killed...

1660
01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:46.210
we killed a lot of guys.

1661
01:21:46.410 --> 01:21:47.800
I... Let's just...
We'll process it later.

1662
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
- Much later.
- Later.

1663
01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:50.530
- Yeah.
- Um...

1664
01:21:51.610 --> 01:21:52.690
Do you wanna...

1665
01:21:53.950 --> 01:21:54.990
Yeah.

1666
01:22:01.410 --> 01:22:03.610
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

1667
01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:06.190
You don't have to forgive
me at all or anything.

1668
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:09.860
But I, like, really want
you to know how sorry I am.

1669
01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:13.070
I was kind of insane,

1670
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:16.450
and the sheer amount
of lies I told is...

1671
01:22:16.650 --> 01:22:18.160
is shocking,

1672
01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:19.760
and it doesn't excuse what I did.

1673
01:22:20.890 --> 01:22:22.600
But I really liked getting to know you.

1674
01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:27.960
And I still really like you.

1675
01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:29.870
- I just...
- You know, you didn't have to start,

1676
01:22:29.871 --> 01:22:32.820
like, a whole fight
club just to date me.

1677
01:22:34.530 --> 01:22:38.640
You could have just, like, talked to me.

1678
01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:41.180
Oh. Okay, uh, I don't really know

1679
01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:43.900
how true that is. You
know what I mean...

1680
01:22:56.770 --> 01:22:58.450
Man, I knew women were good.

1681
01:22:58.650 --> 01:23:00.890
I been sayin' that shit
the whole time, man.

1682
01:23:04.810 --> 01:23:06.080
♪ Vikings! ♪

1683
01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:10.300

- Yeah!
- Oh.

1687
01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:18.180
Yes, queen!

1688
01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:19.380
Yeah!

1689
01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:20.600
Attention, everyone.

1690
01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:22.600
It seems like these Huntington players

1691
01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:24.140
- are not only shitty...
- Yes, queen!

1692
01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:25.520
... football players,

1693
01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:28.980
but they're also dead
cheating bitch asses.

1694
01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:32.820
Meanin' the Vikings
once again win the game!

1695
01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:36.410
- Whoo!
- Decompose, you fuckers!

1696
01:23:58.530 --> 01:23:59.530
Damn it.

1697
01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:01.570
That was my thing!

1698
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:28.040
By the way, what the
fuck are you wearing?

1699
01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:30.690
You got suspenders over your
nipples like a goddamn freak.

1700
01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:39.800
Not gonna come to any meetings.

1701
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.010
It's gonna be fine.

1702
01:24:41.210 --> 01:24:42.490
He's so preoccupied with his divor...

1703
01:24:43.490 --> 01:24:45.180
Yeah.

1704
01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:46.890
I drank before I came to class.

1705
01:24:47.090 --> 01:24:48.490
- What?
- Sorry.

1706
01:24:54.630 --> 01:24:56.280
You got this, Jeff! You got it!

1707
01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:57.860
Oh, shit.

1708
01:24:58.060 --> 01:24:59.860
You scarin' the shit out
of me, boy. You all right?

1709
01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:01.060
- Good shit.
- I got this.

1710
01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:26.430
Y'all were two of my
top students, I think.

1711
01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:27.810
Oh, no, that was two other students.

1712
01:25:28.010 --> 01:25:29.730
But at the end of the
day, it don't matter.

1713
01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:32.620
This shit is, like, beyond me.

1714
01:25:34.670 --> 01:25:36.570
Not Beyond Meat, like the fake meat,

1715
01:25:36.770 --> 01:25:38.530
but beyond me, like...

1716
01:25:38.730 --> 01:25:42.280
Who does that? Where do they do that at?

1717
01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:46.370
Y'all out here forty-two
fakin' for the bacon.

1718
01:25:46.570 --> 01:25:47.680
You understand what I'm sayin'?

1719
01:25:51.810 --> 01:25:54.710
God, this is the most
depressing shit ever.

1720
01:25:54.910 --> 01:25:56.550
Oh, wait, fuck me.

1721
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.010
Idiot. Idiot!

1722
01:26:00.210 --> 01:26:01.405
She's still laughing

1723
01:26:01.406 --> 01:26:02.510
because of the last laugh.

1724
01:26:02.710 --> 01:26:04.720
No! Fuck!

1725
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:09.240
Cut, cut.

1726
01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:13.860
Hey, guys.

1727
01:26:14.050 --> 01:26:15.960
Hey, guys. Hi.

1728
01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:19.460
Hey, guys. Sorry.

1729
01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:39.170
You look like you yodel.

1730
01:26:39.370 --> 01:26:41.690
You look super religious.

1731
01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:49.520
Get fucked, Janice.

1732
01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:51.140
Get railed, Janice.

1733
01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:52.450
Eat a dick, Janice.

1734
01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:58.520
God, what is happening to this country?

1735
01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.360
- Why?
- Why?

1736
01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.630
This is not the Viking way!

1737
