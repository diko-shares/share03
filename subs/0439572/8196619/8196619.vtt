1
00:00:52.362 --> 00:00:54.128
- Have a brilliant day.
- Yeah, thank you.

2
00:00:54.162 --> 00:00:55.627
You too.

3
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.061
Morning. What can I get you?

4
00:00:58.094 --> 00:01:00.226
- Where's curly-hair lady?
- Sara?

5
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.925
She's out sick. Or at least,

6
00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.260
- that's what she says.
- Oh.

7
00:01:03.293 --> 00:01:04.991
She's got a new boyfriend.

8
00:01:05.025 --> 00:01:06.125
What can I get you?

9
00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:07.857
Usually it's my usual

10
00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:09.100
and she usually has it ready
because I'm usually late.

11
00:01:09.124 --> 00:01:10.990
Well, don't keep me in suspense.

12
00:01:11.024 --> 00:01:13.623
Um, it's a PB and BRHC
on a roll.

13
00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:15.290
Okay, so...

14
00:01:15.323 --> 00:01:16.793
"PB" would be peanut
butter, I'm assuming?

15
00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:17.298
Yes.

16
00:01:17.322 --> 00:01:19.654
"BR," bananas, raisins. "H,"
honey. "C," cheese on a roll.

17
00:01:19.687 --> 00:01:21.888
Aren't you blessed
with a fast metabolism.

18
00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:24.021
Are you running a marathon
or something?

19
00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:27.187
You know, my sister ran a
marathon once, God rest her soul.

20
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.319
She's not dead.
She's just exhausted.

21
00:01:29.353 --> 00:01:31.918
We get it, Sharon. You ran.

22
00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:33.651
But everyone has to work
in the morning.

23
00:01:33.684 --> 00:01:35.294
Yeah, I have to go to work,
three minutes ago.

24
00:01:35.318 --> 00:01:37.650
And, sorry, I'm in sort of
a rush for the sandwich.

25
00:01:37.683 --> 00:01:40.949
You can't
rush a good sandwich, dude.

26
00:01:44.616 --> 00:01:46.150
<i>Alfred, really can't talk.</i>

27
00:01:46.183 --> 00:01:47.648
Good morning, Mr. Allen.

28
00:01:47.681 --> 00:01:49.249
<i>No, I'm late.</i>

29
00:01:49.282 --> 00:01:50.857
And I'm starving, and
curly-haired girl isn't here

30
00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:52.190
and her name is Sara,
and she has a boyfriend.

31
00:01:52.214 --> 00:01:54.048
We have a situation
at Gotham General.

32
00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:55.813
A robbery gone wrong.

33
00:01:55.846 --> 00:01:57.779
This is
the middle of the morning.

34
00:01:57.812 --> 00:02:00.179
Why is our bat-friend
even awake?

35
00:02:00.212 --> 00:02:01.844
Call Superman.

36
00:02:01.878 --> 00:02:03.644
That was my first thought.

37
00:02:03.677 --> 00:02:05.677
<i>Sadly, he's otherwise engaged.</i>

38
00:02:05.711 --> 00:02:07.287
<i>- Active volcano in Central America.
</i>- Classic.

39
00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:08.245
What about Diana?

40
00:02:08.277 --> 00:02:09.810
My other first thought.

41
00:02:09.843 --> 00:02:12.077
Rather annoyingly,
she's not picking up.

42
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.817
How many first thoughts, exactly, did
you have before you first thought of me?

43
00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:16.343
Never about her.

44
00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:17.751
- This is about you.
- Hi, sorry. Is my sandwich...

45
00:02:17.775 --> 00:02:18.941
I learned my lesson

46
00:02:18.975 --> 00:02:20.573
on the boat last year.

47
00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:22.350
Stuff my sister comes out with
when she's drunk.

48
00:02:22.374 --> 00:02:24.572
Personal comments about
my mom's friends as well,

49
00:02:24.606 --> 00:02:26.273
which I think
is what I say about her...

50
00:02:37.071 --> 00:02:38.238
Oh, my God!

51
00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:40.203
Flash!

52
00:02:40.237 --> 00:02:42.137
- Hi. I love you.
- Thank you.

53
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.136
- You seem very nice also.
- Oh, my God!

54
00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:46.102
- No way!
- I think I'm gonna die!

55
00:02:46.136 --> 00:02:47.834
Patching you into Mr. Wayne.

56
00:02:47.868 --> 00:02:49.101
No, please don't.

57
00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:49.779
Oh, my God.

58
00:02:49.965 --> 00:02:53.742
Sorry if this sounds weird, but are
you actively eating that candy bar?

59
00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:55.234
Maybe you could throw it to me?

60
00:02:55.267 --> 00:02:57.166
- In the name of justice.
- Yes, yes.

61
00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:59.166
<i>I need you here now, Barry.</i>

62
00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:01.198
Hi, Bruce. Yes, I'm...

63
00:03:01.232 --> 00:03:02.232
coming.

64
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.859

No!

70
00:04:06.183 --> 00:04:07.217
No, no!

71
00:04:14.614 --> 00:04:17.248
Bruce, this is a huge mess.

72
00:04:17.281 --> 00:04:18.580
Why aren't you here?

73
00:04:35.498 --> 00:04:38.730
<i>Bruce, why does it sound
like you're fleeing the scene?</i>

74
00:04:38.764 --> 00:04:42.265
Falcone's idiot kid decided to
try to play in the big leagues.

75
00:04:42.298 --> 00:04:45.132
<i>He put a crew together and broke
into the lab at Gotham General.</i>

76
00:04:45.165 --> 00:04:47.331
<i>Stole a highly deadly virus.</i>

77
00:04:47.364 --> 00:04:50.730
<i>I intercepted them,
but they blasted their way out.</i>

78
00:04:50.764 --> 00:04:52.863
You can handle the hospital,
Barry.

79
00:04:52.896 --> 00:04:54.408
Somebody has to save the rest of
the world, so I was gonna do that.

80
00:04:54.432 --> 00:04:55.864
If you don't mind.

81
00:04:55.897 --> 00:04:57.164
Sounds about right, Bruce.

82
00:05:17.531 --> 00:05:19.764
"Thanks for saving me
from the sinkhole, Flash."

83
00:05:19.797 --> 00:05:21.932
Barry, gas
and water pipes ruptured.

84
00:05:21.965 --> 00:05:23.364
In the basement.

85
00:05:23.398 --> 00:05:24.399
Right.

86
00:05:25.797 --> 00:05:26.964
On it.

87
00:05:39.264 --> 00:05:40.731
Can you open it?

88
00:05:40.764 --> 00:05:42.265
- I think it's locked.
- It's jammed.

89
00:05:42.299 --> 00:05:44.097
God, it's not working!

90
00:05:44.131 --> 00:05:45.399
Oh, please!

91
00:05:55.365 --> 00:05:57.364
Look, Alfred.
I've come to accept

92
00:05:57.398 --> 00:06:00.331
that I'm essentially the
janitor of the Justice League.

93
00:06:00.364 --> 00:06:01.864
Which sucks.

94
00:06:01.897 --> 00:06:03.898
But I've come to accept it.

95
00:06:03.932 --> 00:06:04.998
But...

96
00:06:05.032 --> 00:06:06.932
I can't help but notice...

97
00:06:06.965 --> 00:06:09.830
that it always seems to be
a bat-mess...

98
00:06:09.865 --> 00:06:10.865
that I'm cleaning up.

99
00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:15.965
- Right this way. Eyes forward.
- Yes.

100
00:06:15.998 --> 00:06:18.264
- Stay together, now.
- Yeah, I know, right?

101
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:27.830
Look out!

102
00:06:39.531 --> 00:06:40.832
- Wow. Whoa.
- What?

103
00:07:22.764 --> 00:07:24.965
If my calculations are correct,

104
00:07:24.998 --> 00:07:27.164
and history will prove
they usually are,

105
00:07:27.198 --> 00:07:31.831
the foundational damage is about to
cause the collapse of the east wing.

106
00:07:31.865 --> 00:07:35.032
- East wing's fine.
- All right, I got you.

107
00:07:35.065 --> 00:07:36.898
Which is good
because my speed is lagging.

108
00:07:36.932 --> 00:07:38.199
Running on empty, Alfred.

109
00:07:38.232 --> 00:07:40.398
Do you hear that?

110
00:07:40.431 --> 00:07:41.432
That's my stomach.

111
00:07:47.165 --> 00:07:48.331
No, no.

112
00:07:48.364 --> 00:07:49.731
It's the collapsing east wing.

113
00:08:06.766 --> 00:08:08.932
<i>Barry, 30th floor.</i>

114
00:08:08.965 --> 00:08:10.331
There's a baby...

115
00:08:11.998 --> 00:08:13.332
Shower.

116
00:10:41.532 --> 00:10:42.532
Oh!

117
00:10:43.465 --> 00:10:44.465
Oh!

118
00:10:56.965 --> 00:10:58.166
Mr. Allen,

119
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.765
you've made me very proud.

120
00:11:00.798 --> 00:11:02.299
And a lot of mothers very happy.

121
00:11:02.332 --> 00:11:03.332
Oh!

122
00:11:09.432 --> 00:11:10.465
Yeah.

123
00:11:11.399 --> 00:11:13.299
Okay.

124
00:11:13.332 --> 00:11:16.799
I understand that these events
can be psychologically scarring.

125
00:11:16.832 --> 00:11:19.933
You should seek the services
of a mental health professional.

126
00:11:19.966 --> 00:11:22.965
The Justice League is not
very good at that part yet.

127
00:11:22.998 --> 00:11:24.232
Trust me.

128
00:11:24.265 --> 00:11:25.265
God.

129
00:12:04.533 --> 00:12:07.099
Shake him off!

130
00:12:54.866 --> 00:12:57.199
If that briefcase
falls into the water,

131
00:12:57.233 --> 00:12:59.966
it could wipe out
half of Gotham by lunchtime.

132
00:13:02.466 --> 00:13:04.832
- Damn it.
- Please don't drop me.

133
00:13:04.865 --> 00:13:08.066
Oh, God, no.
Please, please don't.

134
00:13:08.099 --> 00:13:09.099
No!

135
00:13:15.799 --> 00:13:16.966
Sorry I'm late.

136
00:13:22.966 --> 00:13:23.966
Watch your step.

137
00:13:25.099 --> 00:13:26.232
- Hi.
- Hey.

138
00:13:28.766 --> 00:13:30.098
Nice suit.

139
00:13:30.132 --> 00:13:31.299
Looking good, Flash.

140
00:13:31.332 --> 00:13:33.332
Oh, uh... Thank... Uh...

141
00:13:34.799 --> 00:13:35.899
And you...

142
00:13:36.434 --> 00:13:38.265
are welcome.

143
00:13:38.299 --> 00:13:39.841
My ego's far too big to say
"thank you" to someone else.

144
00:13:39.865 --> 00:13:40.866
Hmm.

145
00:13:43.332 --> 00:13:45.333
I developed this...

146
00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:47.409
all-powerful persona to compensate
for my childhood trauma...

147
00:13:47.433 --> 00:13:49.133
I, too, have childhood trauma.

148
00:13:49.166 --> 00:13:51.066
Batman seems crazy.

149
00:13:51.099 --> 00:13:52.376
- The Lasso of Truth...
- Billion dollar. She's the mother...

150
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.099
never gets old.

151
00:13:54.133 --> 00:13:56.132
I'd do a lot better
just giving all my money away.

152
00:13:56.165 --> 00:13:57.775
Yes, if I really wanted to end
crime, I should end poverty.

153
00:13:57.799 --> 00:13:59.500
I know sex exists.

154
00:13:59.533 --> 00:14:01.832
I've just never experienced it.

155
00:14:03.066 --> 00:14:04.099
Damn it.

156
00:14:04.132 --> 00:14:05.199
Well...

157
00:14:05.232 --> 00:14:06.866
I have to run.

158
00:14:06.899 --> 00:14:08.232
Yeah.

159
00:14:08.265 --> 00:14:09.365
Always a pleasure.

160
00:14:12.365 --> 00:14:14.732
The sex thing was a metaphor...

161
00:14:14.766 --> 00:14:16.933
for gothic literature.

162
00:14:16.966 --> 00:14:18.208
There was just no way
to recover from that.

163
00:14:18.232 --> 00:14:20.966
Just let it go.

164
00:14:20.999 --> 00:14:23.467
Well, I'd really love to stay
and clean up more mess...

165
00:14:23.501 --> 00:14:25.866
but this little superhero
needs his breakfast.

166
00:14:25.899 --> 00:14:27.766
Goodbye, Flash.

167
00:14:27.799 --> 00:14:29.133
Yeah. Bye, Batman.

168
00:14:30.132 --> 00:14:32.066
Well done, Mr. Wayne.

169
00:14:32.099 --> 00:14:33.966
<i>Will you be home
for breakfast, sir?</i>

170
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.999
Yes, I think so.

171
00:14:41.099 --> 00:14:42.299
The road to destruction.

172
00:14:42.332 --> 00:14:44.467
This was never about her.

173
00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:45.999
This is about you.

174
00:14:46.033 --> 00:14:49.066
You have to stop
living in the past.

175
00:14:49.099 --> 00:14:50.866
Now, was that
fast enough for you?

176
00:14:54.899 --> 00:14:56.333
Morning, professor...

177
00:15:02.899 --> 00:15:04.232
Ah, look who's here.

178
00:15:04.265 --> 00:15:05.899
Shut up, Albert.

179
00:15:05.933 --> 00:15:08.166
Every day. I don't know
how you do it, Barry.

180
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.732
What'd you, like,
crawl here, bro?

181
00:15:09.766 --> 00:15:11.434
- Is he mad?
- Well, you're getting fired.

182
00:15:11.467 --> 00:15:13.299
- You're getting murdered.
- Oh, no, no, no.

183
00:15:13.333 --> 00:15:14.832
Let me guess.

184
00:15:14.866 --> 00:15:16.466
Your alarm clock didn't go off.

185
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.434
- No...
- Oh, your dog ate your alarm clock.

186
00:15:19.467 --> 00:15:21.433
Your alarm clock ate your keys.

187
00:15:21.466 --> 00:15:24.401
Your keys' grandmother died,
and they need a personal day.

188
00:15:24.434 --> 00:15:26.899
- It was none of those things.
- What was it this time, Barry?

189
00:15:26.933 --> 00:15:28.799
It was, um, something else

190
00:15:28.832 --> 00:15:30.433
that was far less outlandish.

191
00:15:30.466 --> 00:15:32.832
And I know
I missed the meeting...

192
00:15:32.866 --> 00:15:34.808
but I'd still really like to present
these case files for potential review.

193
00:15:34.832 --> 00:15:36.166
I think we rushed these cases.

194
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.133
- We need to reopen them.
- Oh! Rushed?

195
00:15:38.166 --> 00:15:41.066
We got a backlog six months deep,
and you want us to move slower?

196
00:15:41.099 --> 00:15:43.199
You need to focus your motion.

197
00:15:43.232 --> 00:15:45.832
Do the work,
close the case, move on.

198
00:15:47.899 --> 00:15:49.933
You have
a lot of potential, Barry.

199
00:15:49.966 --> 00:15:52.833
You shouldn't still be getting
me coffee after all these years.

200
00:15:52.867 --> 00:15:55.433
You're right. That's...
That's true.

201
00:15:55.466 --> 00:15:56.500
Go get me a coffee.

202
00:15:59.866 --> 00:16:02.233
- Two sugars? Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

203
00:16:15.933 --> 00:16:17.832
You're gonna love this.

204
00:16:17.866 --> 00:16:19.277
I'm very satisfied with the
ruling in the Johnson case.

205
00:16:19.301 --> 00:16:22.300
The evidence our lab analyzed...

206
00:16:22.333 --> 00:16:25.732
was more than sufficient
to be conclusive.

207
00:16:25.766 --> 00:16:28.301
- I'm still working that evidence.
- Because of the diligence

208
00:16:28.334 --> 00:16:30.433
and hard work and focus...

209
00:16:30.466 --> 00:16:33.066
Barry was still working
on that evidence.

210
00:16:33.099 --> 00:16:34.766
Think if it were up to you

211
00:16:34.799 --> 00:16:36.733
that we'd still be scraping
Ted Bundy's molars.

212
00:16:36.767 --> 00:16:40.033
You know what? I'm so happy
you find this all so hilarious,

213
00:16:40.066 --> 00:16:43.899
but we are dealing with real
people's lives, people's families.

214
00:16:43.933 --> 00:16:46.066
And I don't think you can grasp
the gravity of that.

215
00:16:46.099 --> 00:16:47.866
So, why don't you
leave me alone?

216
00:16:47.899 --> 00:16:50.066
- Barry Allen?
- Iris West.

217
00:16:50.501 --> 00:16:51.866
You...

218
00:16:51.899 --> 00:16:54.099
know my full name also.

219
00:16:54.133 --> 00:16:55.999
Yes, from school.

220
00:16:56.033 --> 00:16:58.142
Aw, Barry, you didn't tell us
you had a friend from school.

221
00:16:58.166 --> 00:16:59.561
We actually didn't know
that Barry had a friend.

222
00:16:59.573 --> 00:17:00.042
Wow.

223
00:17:00.066 --> 00:17:01.900
Yeah, what does that
make it now?

224
00:17:01.934 --> 00:17:02.934
- One?
- One.

225
00:17:02.966 --> 00:17:05.233
You guys are so...

226
00:17:05.266 --> 00:17:07.267
Um, bye, you guys.

227
00:17:07.301 --> 00:17:08.832
Okay. Oh, my God.
That was just...

228
00:17:08.866 --> 00:17:10.367
Um...

229
00:17:10.401 --> 00:17:12.832
They're not really my friends.
They're my work friends.

230
00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:14.033
Do you work here?

231
00:17:14.066 --> 00:17:15.401
Yes, I do.

232
00:17:15.434 --> 00:17:17.301
God, it's been a long time, huh?

233
00:17:17.334 --> 00:17:19.166
Hmm.

234
00:17:19.201 --> 00:17:21.732
I feel like we saw each other...

235
00:17:21.766 --> 00:17:23.467
like a few years ago, right?

236
00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:25.066
No, because...

237
00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:27.367
we haven't
seen each other since...

238
00:17:27.401 --> 00:17:28.434
college.

239
00:17:28.467 --> 00:17:29.866
Ah.

240
00:17:29.899 --> 00:17:33.201
Maybe I was just
thinking about you.

241
00:17:33.234 --> 00:17:35.366
Well, I'm really glad
I ran into you.

242
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.033
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

243
00:17:37.066 --> 00:17:39.201
Your father's appeal
is tomorrow, right?

244
00:17:39.234 --> 00:17:41.933
Yeah. How...

245
00:17:41.966 --> 00:17:43.466
Sorry, how do
you know about that?

246
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.467
I'm covering it for the paper.

247
00:17:45.501 --> 00:17:46.401
Oh.

248
00:17:46.434 --> 00:17:48.133
How is he holding up?

249
00:17:49.267 --> 00:17:50.467
Um...

250
00:17:50.501 --> 00:17:52.167
Are you asking for the paper?

251
00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:54.367
- No, I'm asking as a friend.
- Oh.

252
00:17:54.401 --> 00:17:57.267
Although I'm sure the public
would want to know as well.

253
00:18:00.133 --> 00:18:01.800
Well...

254
00:18:01.833 --> 00:18:04.066
my only official comment
is that my dad is innocent.

255
00:18:04.099 --> 00:18:05.066
Right.

256
00:18:05.099 --> 00:18:07.033
I mean, no one...

257
00:18:07.066 --> 00:18:09.767
would want to believe that
their father killed their mother.

258
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.866
What do you mean, "believe"?
My dad shouldn't be in jail.

259
00:18:12.899 --> 00:18:15.267
My mom should be alive.
It's not about what I believe.

260
00:18:15.301 --> 00:18:18.334
- It's about what the truth is.
- Right. No, yes, that's...

261
00:18:18.367 --> 00:18:19.966
Oh, my God. That's what I meant.

262
00:18:20.401 --> 00:18:22.201
Right.

263
00:18:22.234 --> 00:18:24.099
Sorry, I have no official
comment at this time.

264
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.167
<i>You have a collect call</i>

265
00:18:50.201 --> 00:18:51.510
<i>from the
Iron Heights Penitentiary.</i>

266
00:18:51.534 --> 00:18:54.933
<i>- Do you wish to accept?</i>
- Yes.

267
00:18:54.966 --> 00:18:56.967
- Hey, Dad.
<i>- Hey, Barry.</i>

268
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.767
<i>- How ya doing?</i>
- I'm fine.

269
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.899
<i>- You getting out much?</i>
- Yeah.

270
00:19:00.933 --> 00:19:03.401
<i>Well, no. Uh, no.</i>

271
00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:06.501
But I, um, I ran into
an old college friend...

272
00:19:06.534 --> 00:19:08.334
Iris West, today.

273
00:19:08.367 --> 00:19:10.434
Didn't you have
a monster crush on her?

274
00:19:10.467 --> 00:19:12.100
<i>Well, she have a boyfriend?</i>

275
00:19:12.134 --> 00:19:15.867
<i>- Why don't you ask her out?</i>
- Dad, I, um...

276
00:19:15.899 --> 00:19:19.900
I had a friend run the old security
camera footage from the store...

277
00:19:19.934 --> 00:19:22.367
through this new program
he's developed.

278
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.933
And it's crystal clear now.

279
00:19:24.966 --> 00:19:25.966
It's just...

280
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.067
you never look up, Dad.

281
00:19:30.367 --> 00:19:32.467
You can't see your face.

282
00:19:32.501 --> 00:19:36.234
<i>So, without new evidence
to support your alibi...</i>

283
00:19:36.267 --> 00:19:38.899
<i>we're just gonna need to start
thinking about the next appeal.</i>

284
00:19:38.933 --> 00:19:41.966
No, uh-uh. You need to stop
worrying about your old man.

285
00:19:44.068 --> 00:19:46.143
<i>Do that, you might actually
have time for a girlfriend.</i>

286
00:19:46.167 --> 00:19:48.268
But Dad, I don't want...

287
00:19:48.302 --> 00:19:49.833
<i>We've done this before.</i>

288
00:19:49.867 --> 00:19:51.234
This was a last-ditch effort...

289
00:19:51.267 --> 00:19:54.067
and we'll go through
the motions tomorrow.

290
00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.301
<i>I'm okay, really.</i>

291
00:19:56.334 --> 00:19:59.966
You know, sometimes I even think
it's probably easier for me to be in here

292
00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:01.068
than out there...

293
00:20:02.068 --> 00:20:04.301
without her.

294
00:20:04.334 --> 00:20:07.401
<i>'Cause this way,
I can imagine she's alive...</i>

295
00:20:07.434 --> 00:20:09.201
out there living her life.

296
00:20:12.301 --> 00:20:13.301
<i>Barry?</i>

297
00:20:14.833 --> 00:20:15.833
<i>Barry?</i>

298
00:20:16.832 --> 00:20:18.235
<i>You there?</i>

299
00:20:18.268 --> 00:20:19.967
Yeah, I'm here, Dad.

300
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.434
Hey, remember that sauce
she'd make on Sundays?

301
00:20:23.467 --> 00:20:27.335
<i>The whole house would
smell like basil, tomatoes.</i>

302
00:20:27.367 --> 00:20:29.966
<i>And she'd put on my sweats
and start singing.</i>

303
00:20:32.334 --> 00:20:34.067
Yeah, what was that song?

304
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.867
<i>I loved that song.</i>

305
00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.134
Remember that part.

306
00:20:42.799 --> 00:20:44.101
It's not fair.

307
00:20:44.135 --> 00:20:45.833
What's not fair, Monkey?

308
00:20:45.867 --> 00:20:48.135
This question is stupid.

309
00:20:48.168 --> 00:20:51.267
How many calculations can
you think of with an answer of 24?

310
00:20:51.301 --> 00:20:52.967
There are a bajillion answers.

311
00:20:53.001 --> 00:20:54.966
How am I supposed
to fit them all?

312
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.968
You are right. There are a
bajillion answers to this question.

313
00:20:58.001 --> 00:21:00.334
Not every problem
has a solution.

314
00:21:00.367 --> 00:21:02.101
Sometimes you just
have to let go.

315
00:21:04.067 --> 00:21:06.387
Give your brain a rest and help
me make the pasta. Come on.

316
00:21:08.899 --> 00:21:10.268
No.

317
00:21:10.302 --> 00:21:11.302
Henry?

318
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.402
I need you to do me a favor.

319
00:21:14.435 --> 00:21:16.733
- I don't do favors.
- Okay.

320
00:21:16.767 --> 00:21:18.402
Barry needs you
to do him a favor.

321
00:21:18.435 --> 00:21:21.134
Oh, Barry! Yeah, anything.

322
00:21:21.167 --> 00:21:23.101
I need another can of tomatoes.

323
00:21:24.135 --> 00:21:25.267
You have a can of tomatoes.

324
00:21:25.301 --> 00:21:27.001
I need another one.

325
00:21:27.035 --> 00:21:28.876
I thought you guys
went to the store this morning.

326
00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.799
But I forgot the tomatoes.

327
00:21:32.202 --> 00:21:33.467
This looks way more fun.

328
00:21:33.501 --> 00:21:35.502
Let's just let
Barry go to the store.

329
00:21:35.535 --> 00:21:37.168
You drive, right, Squirm?

330
00:21:37.201 --> 00:21:38.501
- What? No.
- Getting so big.

331
00:21:38.534 --> 00:21:40.800
You can do anything. Look at ya.

332
00:21:40.833 --> 00:21:42.301
You're getting gray, actually.

333
00:21:42.334 --> 00:21:44.833
- Green can, not the blue one, okay?
- Got it.

334
00:21:44.867 --> 00:21:46.733
Blue can,
not the green one, right?

335
00:21:46.767 --> 00:21:48.900
- No! Green can, not the blue one.
- What?

336
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:51.899
Oh, God.

337
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.034
She's gonna start singing. Run!

338
00:21:56.968 --> 00:21:58.202
Run, Barry!

339
00:22:16.534 --> 00:22:17.501
I love you, Monkey.

340
00:22:17.534 --> 00:22:19.335
I love you more.

341
00:22:19.368 --> 00:22:20.867
I loved you first.

342
00:22:38.234 --> 00:22:39.234
Nora?

343
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:42.967
Barry!

344
00:22:50.001 --> 00:22:52.302
Barry! Barry!

345
00:22:52.335 --> 00:22:54.235
Call 911 now!

346
00:23:05.268 --> 00:23:06.268
<i>Barry?</i>

347
00:23:07.168 --> 00:23:08.434
<i>Barry?</i>

348
00:23:08.467 --> 00:23:10.402
<i>Don't worry about tomorrow.</i>

349
00:23:10.435 --> 00:23:12.101
<i>We always knew
it was a long shot...</i>

350
00:23:13.201 --> 00:23:15.767
Dad?

351
00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:19.202
<i>Your call with Iron Heights
Penitentiary has been terminated.</i>

352
00:25:05.368 --> 00:25:07.235
<i>Barry Allen?</i>

353
00:25:10.168 --> 00:25:12.268
<i>Evidence our lab...</i>

354
00:25:12.302 --> 00:25:14.001
<i>You need to focus your motion.</i>

355
00:25:14.035 --> 00:25:15.101
<i>Do the work...</i>

356
00:25:18.002 --> 00:25:19.700
<i>She promised...</i>

357
00:25:21.801 --> 00:25:26.334
<i>Now, was that
fast enough for you?</i>

358
00:26:05.835 --> 00:26:08.202
So, you're saying
you went back in time?

359
00:26:08.235 --> 00:26:10.834
- Mm-hmm.
- Like in Pozharnov?

360
00:26:10.868 --> 00:26:12.178
Yeah, like in Pozharnov, except,
but Pozharnov was a second.

361
00:26:12.202 --> 00:26:13.802
This time
I went back a whole day.

362
00:26:13.835 --> 00:26:15.235
So, let's imagine...

363
00:26:15.268 --> 00:26:18.002
that it is, in fact, possible
for you to run...

364
00:26:18.036 --> 00:26:19.468
faster than
the speed of light...

365
00:26:19.502 --> 00:26:21.868
and in so doing,
travel back in time.

366
00:26:23.168 --> 00:26:24.202
It still would be...

367
00:26:24.235 --> 00:26:26.468
wildly irresponsible.

368
00:26:26.502 --> 00:26:28.302
I knew you were gonna say this.

369
00:26:28.335 --> 00:26:30.343
Yes, because, Barry, if
you were to go into the past,

370
00:26:30.367 --> 00:26:33.235
any interaction you have
with your parents or yourself,

371
00:26:33.268 --> 00:26:35.069
you step on
the wrong blade of grass,

372
00:26:35.102 --> 00:26:37.502
you have no idea what the
consequences to that could be.

373
00:26:37.535 --> 00:26:39.735
No, I know.
The butterfly effect, right?

374
00:26:39.769 --> 00:26:41.801
- Yes.
- I get it. But Bruce...

375
00:26:41.834 --> 00:26:43.235
I could fix things.

376
00:26:43.267 --> 00:26:46.901
You could
also destroy everything.

377
00:26:46.935 --> 00:26:49.035
I could save her.

378
00:26:49.068 --> 00:26:51.068
I could save both of them. I...

379
00:26:53.368 --> 00:26:54.734
I could save your parents.

380
00:26:56.267 --> 00:26:58.502
Barry, these scars we have...

381
00:26:58.535 --> 00:27:00.902
make us who we are.

382
00:27:00.936 --> 00:27:04.501
We're not meant
to go back and fix them.

383
00:27:04.534 --> 00:27:07.734
And there's nothing broken
with you that needs to be fixed.

384
00:27:09.936 --> 00:27:12.302
Take it from an old guy
who's made a lot of mistakes.

385
00:27:13.202 --> 00:27:14.402
Don't live your past.

386
00:27:15.901 --> 00:27:17.902
Live your life.

387
00:27:17.936 --> 00:27:20.068
Don't let your tragedy
define you.

388
00:27:20.101 --> 00:27:21.801
What if it's supposed
to define me?

389
00:27:23.935 --> 00:27:25.335
Your tragedy made you a hero.

390
00:27:26.368 --> 00:27:28.101
And also made me alone.

391
00:27:30.835 --> 00:27:32.901
We could hang out.

392
00:27:32.935 --> 00:27:34.302
I mean, do you wanna get a bite?

393
00:27:34.335 --> 00:27:36.268
Like, I'm still hungry.

394
00:27:38.068 --> 00:27:39.068
Not this time.

395
00:27:40.802 --> 00:27:42.068
Maybe some other time.

396
00:27:44.502 --> 00:27:45.702
Yeah.

397
00:27:56.368 --> 00:27:57.735
Nice ride.

398
00:27:58.502 --> 00:28:00.735
You have fancy friends.

399
00:28:00.769 --> 00:28:02.168
Yeah, it was an Uber.

400
00:28:02.868 --> 00:28:04.902
Exec.

401
00:28:04.936 --> 00:28:06.911
Look, Iris, I really can't
talk about the case at all.

402
00:28:06.935 --> 00:28:09.136
I'm not here as a reporter.

403
00:28:10.802 --> 00:28:12.101
Can we talk?

404
00:28:17.302 --> 00:28:19.002
Come on in.

405
00:28:24.268 --> 00:28:27.402
I'm not gonna lie. It's a lot
tidier in here than I expected.

406
00:28:27.435 --> 00:28:29.768
- Yeah? Yeah, well, um...
- Yeah.

407
00:28:29.801 --> 00:28:32.036
I'm a pretty tidy person.

408
00:28:37.001 --> 00:28:38.734
- Can I offer you a drink?
- Sure.

409
00:28:38.768 --> 00:28:39.769
I'll take a beer.

410
00:28:41.834 --> 00:28:42.834
Hmm.

411
00:28:54.901 --> 00:28:56.303
Beers, beers, beers.

412
00:28:56.336 --> 00:28:58.068
I keep 'em in my fridge.

413
00:28:58.101 --> 00:28:59.101
Thanks.

414
00:28:59.468 --> 00:29:00.468
Sure.

415
00:29:02.069 --> 00:29:04.435
Look, I feel really bad

416
00:29:04.468 --> 00:29:05.869
about earlier.

417
00:29:10.869 --> 00:29:13.936
I should've been more sensitive.

418
00:29:13.969 --> 00:29:18.002
And, um, I probably
could've been less sensitive.

419
00:29:18.036 --> 00:29:20.435
I mean, I can't imagine
what you've been through.

420
00:29:20.469 --> 00:29:23.202
It's like you lost
both parents in one day.

421
00:29:23.969 --> 00:29:25.435
I did.

422
00:29:25.469 --> 00:29:27.335
I lost my mom to a tragedy,

423
00:29:27.368 --> 00:29:30.403
and I lost my dad to the
failures of the justice system.

424
00:29:30.436 --> 00:29:33.202
Is that why you got
into criminal forensics?

425
00:29:33.235 --> 00:29:34.435
To try and fix the system?

426
00:29:37.802 --> 00:29:39.336
Yeah.

427
00:29:39.369 --> 00:29:40.469
Yeah, to fix it.

428
00:29:42.368 --> 00:29:44.236
There's gotta be a way
to fix it, right?

429
00:29:44.269 --> 00:29:47.035
I mean, that's kinda why
I got into journalism, too.

430
00:29:47.068 --> 00:29:49.335
I could make it right if I
could just go back somehow

431
00:29:49.368 --> 00:29:52.369
and warn them without them
knowing that I'd warned them.

432
00:29:52.403 --> 00:29:54.835
I... thinking like that's
gonna...

433
00:29:54.868 --> 00:29:56.403
drive you crazy.

434
00:29:56.437 --> 00:29:58.202
"If I could just
go back in time...

435
00:29:58.235 --> 00:30:00.168
"and stop the guy
who did it." It's...

436
00:30:00.202 --> 00:30:02.562
No, I can't do that, 'cause
that's way too much interaction.

437
00:30:04.902 --> 00:30:06.302
My dad wasn't even at home.

438
00:30:06.335 --> 00:30:08.734
My mom sent him
to go get a can of tomatoes.

439
00:30:08.768 --> 00:30:11.012
I think whoever broke into
the house thought it was empty.

440
00:30:11.036 --> 00:30:13.144
And then my mom was in there
with the knife in her hand

441
00:30:13.168 --> 00:30:15.202
and things went bad,
just this absurd

442
00:30:15.235 --> 00:30:17.335
chain of events.

443
00:30:17.368 --> 00:30:20.235
And it's like, this footage should've
finally supported my dad's alibi.

444
00:30:20.268 --> 00:30:21.802
But instead...

445
00:30:21.835 --> 00:30:24.302
three lives ruined
for a can of tomatoes.

446
00:30:31.336 --> 00:30:32.336
Oh, my God.

447
00:30:32.969 --> 00:30:33.969
What?

448
00:30:35.203 --> 00:30:37.101
Well, that could be it.

449
00:30:37.135 --> 00:30:38.878
If my mom doesn't forget
the tomatoes in the first place,

450
00:30:38.902 --> 00:30:41.102
then he never leaves
and she never dies.

451
00:30:41.136 --> 00:30:43.902
No one would even
have to see me.

452
00:30:43.936 --> 00:30:45.379
Bruce said no interaction.
This is no interaction.

453
00:30:45.403 --> 00:30:47.068
This is just quick in,
quick out,

454
00:30:47.101 --> 00:30:48.413
back to the present,
like I was never even there.

455
00:30:48.437 --> 00:30:50.268
That's how I fix it.
Oh, my God, Iris.

456
00:30:50.302 --> 00:30:51.936
- Hmm?
- Thank you, so much.

457
00:30:51.969 --> 00:30:53.236
- This has been great.
- Oh.

458
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:55.135
Um... I'm sorry.

459
00:30:55.168 --> 00:30:57.969
I... I have to leave.

460
00:30:58.002 --> 00:30:59.135
Okay. Right.

461
00:30:59.168 --> 00:31:01.404
Uh...

462
00:31:01.437 --> 00:31:04.168
I had a really great time, by
the way. We should do this again.

463
00:31:18.802 --> 00:31:21.869
<i>Kal-El, son of Krypton.</i>

464
00:31:21.902 --> 00:31:23.436
<i>This is a bad idea.</i>

465
00:31:30.168 --> 00:31:31.236
<i>So, you're fast.</i>

466
00:31:35.036 --> 00:31:37.336
<i>Your dad's a murderer.
Your dad's a murderer.</i>

467
00:31:39.969 --> 00:31:43.370
<i>Call 911 now!</i>

468
00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:45.702
<i>Now!</i>

469
00:31:46.503 --> 00:31:48.169
<i>Now!</i>

470
00:31:48.203 --> 00:31:49.403
<i>Now!</i>

471
00:32:41.769 --> 00:32:42.769
Hi, Mom.

472
00:32:55.503 --> 00:32:57.036
Don't forget the tomatoes.

473
00:32:59.503 --> 00:33:00.703
See you soon.

474
00:33:08.002 --> 00:33:09.002
Please work.

475
00:33:18.337 --> 00:33:20.237
<i>♪ Happy Birthday, dear... ♪</i>

476
00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:23.069
<i>Happy Birthday, Barry.</i>

477
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:31.902

- Go!</i>

478
00:33:31.936 --> 00:33:35.169

to the class of 2013!</i>

479
00:33:39.869 --> 00:33:41.769
<i>I love you so much.</i>

480
00:34:44.102 --> 00:34:46.369
Monkey!

481
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:49.404
What are you wearing?

482
00:34:49.437 --> 00:34:52.437
Is that Barry? And he's early?

483
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:54.304
What universe is this?

484
00:34:54.337 --> 00:34:56.270
You've cut your hair.

485
00:34:56.304 --> 00:34:59.036
Now you can see your eyes.

486
00:34:59.069 --> 00:35:00.903
- You look terrible.
- Henry!

487
00:35:00.937 --> 00:35:02.280
- You look old.
- You look beautiful, baby.

488
00:35:02.304 --> 00:35:04.137
What are they doing to you
over there?

489
00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:06.437
Leave him alone. He's perfect.

490
00:35:07.936 --> 00:35:09.270
Come here.

491
00:35:11.902 --> 00:35:13.070
I love you so much.

492
00:35:13.103 --> 00:35:15.102
I love you, too.

493
00:35:15.137 --> 00:35:16.137
I love you more.

494
00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:18.404
I loved you first.

495
00:35:18.437 --> 00:35:20.170
Go take a shower and change.

496
00:35:20.204 --> 00:35:22.803
You smell like a boot.
Go, go, go.

497
00:35:25.304 --> 00:35:27.069
"Old," seriously?

498
00:35:27.103 --> 00:35:28.835
Well, no, I mean like mature.

499
00:35:28.869 --> 00:35:30.836
He's at that age,
he wants to look old.

500
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:33.137
He, you know,
gets into bars that way.

501
00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:34.770
How can I help?

502
00:35:40.103 --> 00:35:43.104
Mm. Hey, Mom, how was your day?

503
00:35:43.138 --> 00:35:45.137
How was your month,
or your last 18 years?

504
00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:46.503
Or that's a weird question...

505
00:35:46.536 --> 00:35:48.137
'cause I was here.

506
00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:50.936
But obviously, we share
those memories together.

507
00:35:50.969 --> 00:35:52.812
Or I don't know, maybe we
could make some new memories.

508
00:35:52.836 --> 00:35:54.513
Like we could go to the
aquarium, or the circus,

509
00:35:54.536 --> 00:35:56.437
or to the park and you
could push me on a swing.

510
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:58.370
That's also weird
because I'm an adult now,

511
00:35:58.404 --> 00:36:00.736
so I'd probably motivate
my own motion on a swing.

512
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:02.290
So, how was it this week?
How's school?

513
00:36:04.036 --> 00:36:07.304
At school was... is good.

514
00:36:07.337 --> 00:36:09.003
- Mm.
- School's been great.

515
00:36:09.037 --> 00:36:11.835
I've just been working
really hard there on my...

516
00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:13.138
studies.

517
00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:14.869
Did you ask out
that girl from econ?

518
00:36:14.902 --> 00:36:17.270
I know freshman year is about

519
00:36:17.304 --> 00:36:19.835
going out, meeting people, okay?

520
00:36:19.869 --> 00:36:20.936
Exploring things.

521
00:36:21.537 --> 00:36:23.237
Experimenting.

522
00:36:25.204 --> 00:36:27.404
But you have to be very careful.

523
00:36:27.437 --> 00:36:28.437
Oh, shit.

524
00:36:30.138 --> 00:36:31.770
I... have to shit.

525
00:36:33.304 --> 00:36:34.337
Outside.

526
00:36:41.204 --> 00:36:42.304
Help!

527
00:36:42.337 --> 00:36:44.003
Shh! Why are you here?

528
00:36:44.038 --> 00:36:45.038
What year is it?

529
00:36:47.037 --> 00:36:48.137
- No, no, no.
- Help!

530
00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:55.404
That's my face.

531
00:36:55.436 --> 00:36:57.869
You stole my face.

532
00:36:57.902 --> 00:36:59.380
Think I'm having
a mushroom flashback?

533
00:36:59.404 --> 00:37:01.304
- Is that a thing?
- How old are you?

534
00:37:02.869 --> 00:37:03.869
Eighteen.

535
00:37:12.937 --> 00:37:14.170
Whoa.

536
00:37:15.037 --> 00:37:16.802
This is mad trippy.

537
00:37:16.835 --> 00:37:18.237
So, we're, like, in the future.

538
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:20.735
No, wait.
This is not trippy, dude.

539
00:37:20.769 --> 00:37:22.937
This is catastrophic.

540
00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:25.013
And no, we're not in the future. I was
supposed to be back in the present,

541
00:37:25.037 --> 00:37:26.337
but I'm still in the past.

542
00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:28.404
And there's not
supposed to be two of me.

543
00:37:28.437 --> 00:37:30.812
You and I are not supposed to
be occupying the same reality at all,

544
00:37:30.836 --> 00:37:32.736
let alone interacting.

545
00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:34.746
I just can't believe I'm a
superhero who time travels...

546
00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:37.504
No, no, no.
You are not anything.

547
00:37:37.537 --> 00:37:40.137
Which is good. You don't want
to be a superhero. It's scary.

548
00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:43.736
And I get bug splatter
in my teeth all the time.

549
00:37:44.304 --> 00:37:45.802
Awesome.

550
00:37:45.835 --> 00:37:47.437
Hey, do the thing again.

551
00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:48.703
No, we don't have time.

552
00:37:50.003 --> 00:37:52.836
- Mom!
- Shh!

553
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:54.590
What are you doing?
You're gonna tattle now?

554
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:56.870
- Do the thing.
- Fine.

555
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:04.104
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Happy?

556
00:38:04.138 --> 00:38:05.138
Now undo it.

557
00:38:21.504 --> 00:38:22.703
I can't, I can't.

558
00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:24.835
Ow.

559
00:38:24.869 --> 00:38:27.270
Barry, are you okay up there?

560
00:38:27.304 --> 00:38:28.937
We're fine! I'm fine!

561
00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:30.470
Okay, Monkey.

562
00:38:30.504 --> 00:38:33.204
So, do you have like a plane
that goes underwater?

563
00:38:33.237 --> 00:38:35.938
Or like a boat that can fly?

564
00:38:35.971 --> 00:38:37.103
How old are you, like 40?

565
00:38:37.137 --> 00:38:39.171
Okay, you don't stop talking.

566
00:38:39.205 --> 00:38:42.270
It's not charming.
It's abrasive and exhausting.

567
00:38:42.304 --> 00:38:45.237
And, oh, my God. I am starting
to realize what people mean.

568
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:46.735
Just...

569
00:38:46.769 --> 00:38:48.803
do me a favor

570
00:38:48.836 --> 00:38:51.405
and promise me that meeting me
isn't gonna screw up space-time.

571
00:38:52.104 --> 00:38:53.204
Broski...

572
00:38:54.003 --> 00:38:55.170
I got you.

573
00:38:55.204 --> 00:38:56.470
Shit, I'm in so much trouble.

574
00:38:56.504 --> 00:38:57.770
What do you mean?

575
00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:00.004
What do I do?

576
00:39:01.071 --> 00:39:02.803
I could drug you.

577
00:39:02.836 --> 00:39:04.071
Yeah, I could drug you,

578
00:39:04.104 --> 00:39:05.446
and then you'd pass out,
you'd wake up

579
00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:07.304
and you'd forget
that anything ever happened.

580
00:39:07.337 --> 00:39:08.779
And it wouldn't be wrong,
right? Because you're me.

581
00:39:08.803 --> 00:39:10.770
No! I mean, we shouldn't.

582
00:39:10.803 --> 00:39:12.770
- Please don't... drug me.
- No.

583
00:39:12.803 --> 00:39:14.413
No. Because here's the thing,
and I thought about it before.

584
00:39:14.437 --> 00:39:16.070
I don't want to be drugged.

585
00:39:16.103 --> 00:39:19.137
But I'm sure
we can think of another way.

586
00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:20.736
Let's put on
our Barry thinking caps

587
00:39:20.769 --> 00:39:22.736
and think of
a different solution

588
00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:24.103
for memory loss.

589
00:39:24.137 --> 00:39:26.071
Also, I'm a green belt...

590
00:39:26.104 --> 00:39:27.470
in the Capoeira,

591
00:39:27.504 --> 00:39:29.736
and I have
extensively studied wrestler,

592
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:32.304
and I could just go
frickin' lunatic on you.

593
00:39:32.337 --> 00:39:33.617
Besides,
I have a date tonight...

594
00:39:36.504 --> 00:39:38.736
Okay.

595
00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:40.812
How hard do you have to hit
someone to make them forget stuff?

596
00:39:40.836 --> 00:39:43.371
If I hit you in the past,
will it hurt me in the future?

597
00:39:43.405 --> 00:39:45.237
Wait. You say
you have a date tonight?

598
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:47.004
Yeah. Wait, what were you doing?

599
00:39:47.038 --> 00:39:48.971
Uh, nothing.
Who's your date with?

600
00:39:49.004 --> 00:39:52.004
This super babe
in my econ class.

601
00:39:52.038 --> 00:39:54.170
- Iris West?
- Oh, my God!

602
00:39:54.204 --> 00:39:55.471
Do we marry her?

603
00:39:55.505 --> 00:39:57.238
You're going on
a date with her tonight?

604
00:39:57.271 --> 00:39:58.937
That's why
I need Mom to do my laundry.

605
00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:00.871
You don't even
do your own laundry?

606
00:40:00.904 --> 00:40:01.904
Do you?

607
00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:04.238
Okay.

608
00:40:04.271 --> 00:40:06.071
- I'm actually gonna go.
- What do you mean?

609
00:40:06.104 --> 00:40:07.937
Enjoy your life. Do you.

610
00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:10.071
Change literally nothing.

611
00:40:10.104 --> 00:40:12.346
- Um, I'll see you again never.
- I have a few more questions, though.

612
00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:14.305
We have so much
to learn from each other.

613
00:40:15.803 --> 00:40:16.837
Oh, great.

614
00:40:16.871 --> 00:40:18.205
Well, you're leaving me.

615
00:40:18.238 --> 00:40:20.170
And now the storm's
gonna ruin my date.

616
00:40:21.138 --> 00:40:22.305
What day is it today?

617
00:40:23.804 --> 00:40:26.104
Uh... Uh...

618
00:40:26.971 --> 00:40:28.138
Sunday?

619
00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:29.170
No, the date.

620
00:40:31.238 --> 00:40:32.770
It's September 29th.

621
00:40:33.804 --> 00:40:34.804
Shit.

622
00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:38.338
This storm, this is the day.

623
00:40:38.371 --> 00:40:40.904
- What day?
- The day I got my powers.

624
00:40:40.938 --> 00:40:43.071
The day you get your powers.

625
00:40:44.305 --> 00:40:45.871
- Powers?
- Listen...

626
00:40:45.904 --> 00:40:47.514
I can't tell you why
I traveled back in time,

627
00:40:47.538 --> 00:40:50.204
and I can't tell you
what I changed.

628
00:40:50.237 --> 00:40:52.904
But, essentially,
in my version of reality,

629
00:40:52.938 --> 00:40:55.003
I ended up interning
at the Central City Crime Lab

630
00:40:55.037 --> 00:40:57.771
in my freshman year,
and that's where it happened.

631
00:40:57.804 --> 00:40:59.504
Well, happens.

632
00:40:59.537 --> 00:41:02.205
Tonight, September 29, the
accident that gives me my powers.

633
00:41:02.238 --> 00:41:03.938
And if you're not there...

634
00:41:04.938 --> 00:41:05.938
in 30 minutes...

635
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:09.038
then you won't get the powers.

636
00:41:09.071 --> 00:41:11.904
Which means
I don't get the powers, maybe?

637
00:41:11.938 --> 00:41:14.938
And then, that would mean
that I lose my way

638
00:41:14.971 --> 00:41:16.938
of getting back in time
in the first place,

639
00:41:16.971 --> 00:41:19.004
and then I literally
have no idea what happens.

640
00:41:19.837 --> 00:41:21.003
Powers?

641
00:41:24.904 --> 00:41:26.405
Wait, but what about
our date tonight?

642
00:41:26.438 --> 00:41:29.304
She might be our future wife.

643
00:41:29.337 --> 00:41:32.205
There might not be a future...

644
00:41:32.238 --> 00:41:34.071
if you don't come with me...

645
00:41:34.104 --> 00:41:35.171
right now.

646
00:41:41.938 --> 00:41:43.471
Eight minutes.

647
00:41:43.505 --> 00:41:45.446
How are we gonna to get inside?
What are you doing?

648
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:46.872
Would you stop whining?

649
00:41:46.904 --> 00:41:49.271
This is gonna feel kinda weird.

650
00:42:13.038 --> 00:42:14.371
We walk through the door.

651
00:42:15.971 --> 00:42:17.771
Yes, it's okay.
It's called phasing.

652
00:42:17.804 --> 00:42:18.871
Come on.

653
00:42:21.538 --> 00:42:22.971
I love phasing.

654
00:42:26.004 --> 00:42:27.004
Uh-huh.

655
00:42:28.171 --> 00:42:30.171
Everybody moves.

656
00:42:53.971 --> 00:42:56.038
Well... this is it.

657
00:42:56.071 --> 00:42:58.104
This is where I was sitting.

658
00:42:58.138 --> 00:43:00.338
And actually,
let me take this for you.

659
00:43:00.371 --> 00:43:01.837
Thank you.

660
00:43:01.871 --> 00:43:03.972
Okay, I had just
opened those windows...

661
00:43:05.904 --> 00:43:07.837
to clear out the fumes.

662
00:43:08.904 --> 00:43:10.038
Right around now.

663
00:43:10.071 --> 00:43:12.004
And I was sitting in that chair,

664
00:43:12.038 --> 00:43:13.871
and I was right under
this shelf of chemicals.

665
00:43:13.904 --> 00:43:15.904
And that's when
the lightning hits.

666
00:43:15.938 --> 00:43:17.138
Wait.

667
00:43:17.171 --> 00:43:18.771
- I get hit by lightning?
- No, no, no.

668
00:43:18.804 --> 00:43:20.205
You don't get hit by lightning.

669
00:43:20.238 --> 00:43:21.514
Okay, 'cause for a second
I thought you said...

670
00:43:21.538 --> 00:43:23.004
The lightning
hits the chemicals...

671
00:43:23.038 --> 00:43:24.737
which then you get bathed in,

672
00:43:24.771 --> 00:43:26.505
- and that's what electrocutes you.
- Okay,

673
00:43:26.538 --> 00:43:27.882
but I don't want to
be electrocuted, though.

674
00:43:27.894 --> 00:43:28.347
Sit down.

675
00:43:28.371 --> 00:43:30.505
- No, you sit down.
- I already have the powers!

676
00:43:30.538 --> 00:43:31.804
You already have the powers!

677
00:43:31.837 --> 00:43:33.038
Exactly!

678
00:43:33.071 --> 00:43:34.805
I am not getting
struck by lightning!

679
00:44:14.771 --> 00:44:15.771
It worked.

680
00:44:23.505 --> 00:44:25.772
It looks like you lost a tooth.

681
00:44:29.004 --> 00:44:31.071
Oh.

682
00:44:32.104 --> 00:44:33.939
- No?
- You lost a tooth.

683
00:44:45.771 --> 00:44:47.338
All right. We gotta go.

684
00:44:51.139 --> 00:44:52.837
What have we got?

685
00:44:52.871 --> 00:44:54.405
The alarms in the sterile lab.

686
00:44:54.438 --> 00:44:55.438
Go check it.

687
00:45:00.205 --> 00:45:01.438
Securing the entrance.

688
00:45:05.305 --> 00:45:06.771
We've gotta phase.

689
00:45:06.804 --> 00:45:08.139
Phase, phasing.

690
00:45:30.972 --> 00:45:32.871
Oh...

691
00:45:53.837 --> 00:45:54.871
Shit!

692
00:45:59.506 --> 00:46:00.738
I'm slow.

693
00:46:02.038 --> 00:46:03.972
Oh. Oh.

694
00:46:08.239 --> 00:46:10.405
Why is your place so much nicer

695
00:46:10.438 --> 00:46:12.472
- than I expected it to be?
- You like it?

696
00:46:12.506 --> 00:46:14.506
Mom had to help decorate.

697
00:46:14.539 --> 00:46:15.871
You know Mom.

698
00:46:15.904 --> 00:46:18.271
Right, yeah. Classic Mom.

699
00:46:18.305 --> 00:46:19.305
Classic Mom.

700
00:46:22.205 --> 00:46:23.205
Hmm.

701
00:46:26.472 --> 00:46:28.371
- What a day.
- Barry,

702
00:46:28.405 --> 00:46:29.905
the accident gave you powers,

703
00:46:29.939 --> 00:46:31.439
but took mine away.

704
00:46:31.472 --> 00:46:33.738
So, I don't know how I get back.

705
00:46:33.772 --> 00:46:35.081
Without access
to the Speed Force,

706
00:46:35.105 --> 00:46:37.804
I don't know how I ever leave.

707
00:46:37.838 --> 00:46:39.939
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

708
00:46:39.972 --> 00:46:42.038
- I might be stuck.
- Wait.

709
00:46:43.338 --> 00:46:44.705
I have powers now?

710
00:46:45.439 --> 00:46:46.872
Yeah, but...

711
00:46:46.905 --> 00:46:48.238
you... No, no, no.

712
00:47:01.104 --> 00:47:03.972
Holy speed balls.

713
00:47:04.005 --> 00:47:06.171
Okay, I know
this is incredibly exciting,

714
00:47:06.205 --> 00:47:07.406
because I went through it.

715
00:47:07.439 --> 00:47:08.872
Speedy Gonzales!

716
00:47:08.905 --> 00:47:11.004
Yes, I've done it
many times myself.

717
00:47:11.038 --> 00:47:12.972
You can't just start...

718
00:47:14.005 --> 00:47:15.406
Shit.

Ahh!

729
00:48:26.972 --> 00:48:28.971
Okay, I'm leaving!

730
00:48:39.139 --> 00:48:40.838
<i>Put your hands up.</i>

731
00:48:56.539 --> 00:48:57.972
What did you do?

732
00:48:58.005 --> 00:48:59.905
Nothing. Why?

733
00:49:06.005 --> 00:49:07.872
Barry...

734
00:49:07.905 --> 00:49:09.781
I could've told you about
the clothes. It's friction.

735
00:49:09.805 --> 00:49:11.915
You run too fast, and regular
fabrics are gonna burn up.

736
00:49:11.939 --> 00:49:14.805
It's the same reason why you can't
move people very far at hyperspeed.

737
00:49:14.838 --> 00:49:16.373
That broccoli looks rotten.

738
00:49:16.407 --> 00:49:18.005
Look, some things you can move.

739
00:49:18.039 --> 00:49:19.738
Like, you can move,

740
00:49:19.772 --> 00:49:22.139
for instance, a microwave.

741
00:49:22.172 --> 00:49:24.372
But you can't move
something like, say...

742
00:49:24.406 --> 00:49:25.905
- a baby.
- Barry,

743
00:49:25.939 --> 00:49:27.482
it's like I've never eaten
anything before.

744
00:49:27.506 --> 00:49:31.239
Everything has this
vivid flavor. Try a little.

745
00:49:31.273 --> 00:49:33.138
Just take a little bite.

746
00:49:33.171 --> 00:49:34.939
That's bad, isn't it?

747
00:49:34.972 --> 00:49:36.282
Yeah, this is not
good. No, I was kidding.

748
00:49:36.306 --> 00:49:38.105
I'm amazing. We're amazing.

749
00:49:38.139 --> 00:49:40.105
I'm so hungry.

750
00:49:41.306 --> 00:49:42.939
Hey, wait.

751
00:49:42.972 --> 00:49:45.005
I wanna try that phasing thing.
How do I do that?

752
00:49:45.039 --> 00:49:47.072
You don't. Not yet.

753
00:49:47.105 --> 00:49:49.005
Okay? It's very complicated.

754
00:49:49.039 --> 00:49:51.440
Takes a long time to train
your body to be able to speed up

755
00:49:51.473 --> 00:49:53.415
whilst your molecules slow
down enough to pass through

756
00:49:53.439 --> 00:49:55.440
the molecular structure
of solid objects...

757
00:49:58.539 --> 00:49:59.939
Get out of here!

758
00:50:06.539 --> 00:50:09.072
You've gotta start letting me
finish my sentences.

759
00:50:10.273 --> 00:50:12.072
Are we always this sleepy?

760
00:50:12.105 --> 00:50:14.406
And hungry and naked?

761
00:50:14.439 --> 00:50:16.340
Well, the first two, yes.

762
00:50:16.373 --> 00:50:18.939
The third one, no.
I've figured that part out.

763
00:50:18.972 --> 00:50:20.507
And honestly,
if we're gonna do this

764
00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:22.506
there's a lot I'm gonna have to
explain to you.

765
00:50:22.539 --> 00:50:25.072
So, a good place to start,
I guess,

766
00:50:25.105 --> 00:50:27.905
is that, yeah, the original suit

767
00:50:27.939 --> 00:50:29.939
was actually made out
of this polysynth...

768
00:50:31.005 --> 00:50:32.306
Or we'll

769
00:50:32.339 --> 00:50:34.240
pick this up tomorrow.

770
00:50:34.273 --> 00:50:35.972
So, the suit is inside the ring?

771
00:50:36.005 --> 00:50:38.039
- Yeah.
- What?

772
00:50:39.139 --> 00:50:40.406
And I can have this?

773
00:50:40.439 --> 00:50:42.440
No, you can't have it.
You can borrow it

774
00:50:42.473 --> 00:50:44.273
so you don't kill yourself
using your powers.

775
00:50:45.805 --> 00:50:47.872
You're gonna push this button

776
00:50:47.905 --> 00:50:49.348
and the silk molecules are gonna
uncoil, absorbing atmospheric gases

777
00:50:49.372 --> 00:50:51.172
and expanding the suit
to full size.

778
00:50:51.207 --> 00:50:52.340
Ready?

779
00:51:10.273 --> 00:51:11.973
It was so tiny...

780
00:51:12.005 --> 00:51:14.048
You're supposed to put it on
before it hits the floor.

781
00:51:14.072 --> 00:51:16.105
What, like change...

782
00:51:16.139 --> 00:51:17.838
right here in front of you?

783
00:51:17.872 --> 00:51:19.515
There's no one even
here anyway, Barry. Come on...

784
00:51:19.539 --> 00:51:22.473
- Whoo, man.
- Tight.

785
00:51:23.805 --> 00:51:25.072
It hurts.

786
00:51:25.105 --> 00:51:26.507
You know where it hurts?

787
00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:28.973
- In my dick.
- Okay. I know, I know,

788
00:51:29.006 --> 00:51:30.738
but I don't need to know.

789
00:51:30.772 --> 00:51:32.838
- Sorry, can we move on?
- Mm-hmm.

790
00:51:32.872 --> 00:51:34.373
Here's what I'm thinking.

791
00:51:34.407 --> 00:51:36.372
If I can train you
to move like I do,

792
00:51:36.406 --> 00:51:37.906
then we can re-create
the Chronobowl.

793
00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:38.940
Chronobowl?

794
00:51:38.972 --> 00:51:39.939
In the Speed Force.

795
00:51:39.972 --> 00:51:42.039
Speed Force?

796
00:51:42.072 --> 00:51:43.149
And then maybe we can find some
way to get me back to the future.

797
00:51:43.173 --> 00:51:45.272
<i>Back to the Future.</i> Yes!

798
00:51:45.306 --> 00:51:46.873
Eric Stoltz

799
00:51:46.905 --> 00:51:49.307
is chur boy in that movie.

800
00:51:49.339 --> 00:51:51.240
What an embodied performance.

801
00:51:51.273 --> 00:51:53.140
You mean Michael J. Fox?

802
00:51:53.173 --> 00:51:55.240
<i>Back to the Future?</i>

803
00:51:55.273 --> 00:51:57.470
- Yeah, in the movie <i>Back to the Future?
</i>- Oh, my God!

804
00:52:00.373 --> 00:52:01.838
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

805
00:52:09.173 --> 00:52:10.416
You need to
take the suit off now.

806
00:52:10.439 --> 00:52:11.973
Thank God.

807
00:52:17.507 --> 00:52:19.439
<i>Reported seeing
a mysterious object</i>

808
00:52:19.472 --> 00:52:22.106
<i>hovering above
the Australian seaboard.</i>

809
00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:23.727
<i>We've obtained
footage from the sighting...</i>

810
00:52:23.739 --> 00:52:24.272
Zod.

811
00:52:24.306 --> 00:52:26.373
<i>- And as you can see, the object...
</i>- "Zod"?

812
00:52:26.407 --> 00:52:28.707
<i>Appears to be a
flying ship of some sort.</i>

813
00:52:28.719 --> 00:52:29.507
What's a zod?

814
00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:31.939
<i>According to
US government officials,</i>

815
00:52:31.972 --> 00:52:33.507
<i>satellite data</i>

816
00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:35.473
<i>has confirmed
the presence of a spacecraft.</i>

817
00:52:35.507 --> 00:52:37.372
<i>We'll be sure...</i>

818
00:52:40.838 --> 00:52:42.706
<i>My name is General Zod.</i>

819
00:52:44.373 --> 00:52:46.074
<i>I come from a world</i>

820
00:52:46.107 --> 00:52:47.972
<i>far from yours.</i>

821
00:52:48.005 --> 00:52:50.440
<i>For some time, your world</i>

822
00:52:50.473 --> 00:52:54.207
<i>- has sheltered one of my citizens.
- No,</i> no, no.

823
00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:55.121
This can't be happening.

824
00:52:55.133 --> 00:52:56.781
<i>I request that you
return this individual...</i>

825
00:52:56.805 --> 00:52:58.406
- Not now.
<i>- To my custody.</i>

826
00:52:58.439 --> 00:53:00.838
What's happening?

827
00:53:00.872 --> 00:53:02.240
<i>For reasons unknown...</i>

828
00:53:02.273 --> 00:53:03.973
Zod's looking for Superman.

829
00:53:04.006 --> 00:53:05.340
What's a superman?

830
00:53:08.106 --> 00:53:09.449
Superman is an alien
who lives on Earth.

831
00:53:09.473 --> 00:53:11.472
I'm assuming still incognito.

832
00:53:11.506 --> 00:53:14.738
But, yeah, he's an alien,
and he's very powerful,

833
00:53:14.772 --> 00:53:16.340
and he's just the best.

834
00:53:16.373 --> 00:53:19.772
And then Zod is an alien
from the same planet,

835
00:53:19.805 --> 00:53:21.307
also very powerful,

836
00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:22.738
but he's just the worst.

837
00:53:22.772 --> 00:53:25.440
And Zod came here to find Clark.

838
00:53:25.473 --> 00:53:28.373
- Wait, who's Clark?
- Clark is Superman.

839
00:53:28.406 --> 00:53:30.473
- Oh. Okay.
- But then

840
00:53:30.507 --> 00:53:34.006
Zod also tried to terraform the
planet with this World Engine thing,

841
00:53:34.041 --> 00:53:35.507
and Superman
stopped him eventually,

842
00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:38.739
but not before Zod killed
thousands of people.

843
00:53:38.773 --> 00:53:40.005
- Yeesh.
- And at the time,

844
00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:42.174
there was
nothing I could do, I've...

845
00:53:46.241 --> 00:53:47.872
Wait, you...

846
00:53:47.905 --> 00:53:48.972
You were there?

847
00:53:50.241 --> 00:53:52.738
Yeah, I had just
gotten my powers.

848
00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:57.738
<i>And I was still putting some
finishing touches on my suit.</i>

849
00:54:01.273 --> 00:54:03.373
<i>This thing, Zod's World Engine,</i>

850
00:54:03.407 --> 00:54:06.006
<i>it started destroying
Metropolis, so I just went there</i>

851
00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:08.739
<i>and I started
trying to save people.</i>

852
00:54:09.507 --> 00:54:10.507
Daddy?

853
00:54:11.973 --> 00:54:13.007
Listen to me!

854
00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:14.738
Run away!

855
00:54:14.772 --> 00:54:15.772
Run away!

856
00:54:22.006 --> 00:54:24.106
<i>There was this kid, and I...</i>

857
00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:26.240
<i>I got him, but then...</i>

858
00:54:26.273 --> 00:54:27.805
<i>I couldn't get his dad.</i>

859
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:30.373
Daddy!

860
00:54:47.473 --> 00:54:48.739
<i>It was all I could do,</i>

861
00:54:48.772 --> 00:54:49.940
<i>save that one kid.</i>

862
00:54:52.006 --> 00:54:53.838
Only Superman could stop Zod.

863
00:54:55.839 --> 00:54:57.872
But not in time
to save those people.

864
00:54:57.905 --> 00:54:59.440
And now
it's about to happen again.

865
00:55:00.074 --> 00:55:01.407
But...

866
00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.839
if I can find
the entire Justice League,

867
00:55:03.873 --> 00:55:05.940
Superman and
the rest of the band...

868
00:55:05.973 --> 00:55:07.374
Right.

869
00:55:07.408 --> 00:55:09.106
Then maybe I can prevent
the whole thing

870
00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:10.940
from ever even happening at all.

871
00:55:14.106 --> 00:55:16.440
- Um, give me your laptop.
- Okay.

872
00:55:16.473 --> 00:55:17.873
What is that smell?

873
00:55:17.906 --> 00:55:19.373
Ugh. Could be anything.

874
00:55:20.374 --> 00:55:21.374
Honestly.

875
00:55:22.839 --> 00:55:24.073
Who's that?

876
00:55:24.106 --> 00:55:26.473
Oh. That's Gary.
That's the smell. It's...

877
00:55:26.507 --> 00:55:28.240
Don't worry. He's breezy.

878
00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.973
We can do this.

879
00:55:32.006 --> 00:55:34.240
Uh, let's see, Victor Stone,
Gotham City University.

880
00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:39.074
Oh, this is my roommate, Patty.

881
00:55:39.106 --> 00:55:40.006
Patty...

882
00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.273
is your roommate?

883
00:55:41.307 --> 00:55:44.006
And that's her boyfriend,
Albert.

884
00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.340
What's up?

885
00:55:45.373 --> 00:55:47.208
Good morning.

886
00:55:48.373 --> 00:55:51.074
Oh, sorry. And, uh, guys...

887
00:55:52.007 --> 00:55:53.407
This is my cousin.

888
00:55:54.073 --> 00:55:55.073
Barry.

889
00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:58.240
Whoa.

890
00:56:00.941 --> 00:56:01.941
I'm starving.

891
00:56:05.806 --> 00:56:07.106
Okay.

892
00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:08.773
Victor Stone,
Gotham City University.

893
00:56:08.806 --> 00:56:10.473
Yes. Here he is.

894
00:56:10.507 --> 00:56:12.773
Victor Stone, star quarterback
for the Knight...

895
00:56:12.806 --> 00:56:14.073
Shit, okay.

896
00:56:14.106 --> 00:56:15.440
He's not Cyborg yet.

897
00:56:15.473 --> 00:56:18.041
Wonder Woman.

898
00:56:18.073 --> 00:56:19.307
Wonder Woman!

899
00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:21.974
Las Vegas residency.

900
00:56:22.007 --> 00:56:24.408
Illusions, juggling, and zebras.

901
00:56:24.441 --> 00:56:26.974
No. That is not Diana.

902
00:56:27.006 --> 00:56:28.907
- Aquaman.
- Aquaman?

903
00:56:28.941 --> 00:56:30.440
Is that like a super mermaid?

904
00:56:30.473 --> 00:56:31.906
No, Albert,

905
00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:33.374
he's not a super mermaid.

906
00:56:33.408 --> 00:56:35.806
Okay? He's half Atlantean,
half human

907
00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:38.739
with superhuman strength who
can control marine life with his mind.

908
00:56:38.773 --> 00:56:39.907
So, like a super mermaid?

909
00:56:39.941 --> 00:56:41.140
No, Albert!

910
00:56:41.173 --> 00:56:43.007
That is what you described.

911
00:56:43.041 --> 00:56:44.906
We'll just try Arthur Curry...

912
00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:46.174
Maine...

913
00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:49.040
lighthouse.

914
00:56:50.474 --> 00:56:52.806
Here we are. Thomas Curry.
That's his dad.

915
00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:53.840
Uh, phone.

916
00:56:55.074 --> 00:56:56.773
Hello.

917
00:56:56.806 --> 00:56:58.806
<i>- Hello, Thomas Curry?
- Yes.</i>

918
00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:00.274
Could I speak to Arthur?

919
00:57:00.307 --> 00:57:01.807
Is Arthur around?

920
00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:03.840
You wanna speak to my dog?

921
00:57:03.874 --> 00:57:07.040
What? No, no. Um, sorry. Uh...

922
00:57:07.073 --> 00:57:09.107
- Is this Thomas Curry?
<i>- Yes.</i>

923
00:57:09.141 --> 00:57:11.941
- And you work at a lighthouse?
<i>- Yes.</i>

924
00:57:11.974 --> 00:57:14.106
Okay, and your wife is
the queen of Atlantis?

925
00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:16.007
<i>- Will you accept this rose?
- Yes.</i>

926
00:57:17.373 --> 00:57:19.006
Uh, no.

927
00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.840
Uh, right, but maybe, maybe...

928
00:57:20.874 --> 00:57:23.273
um, a fish like woman

929
00:57:23.307 --> 00:57:25.773
washed into your life

930
00:57:25.807 --> 00:57:27.874
- at some point or another?
<i>- Very funny, asshole.</i>

931
00:57:30.874 --> 00:57:33.041
Arthur Curry was never born.

932
00:57:33.074 --> 00:57:34.907
- What?
- This is a disaster.

933
00:57:34.941 --> 00:57:36.473
I-I-I completely
destroyed history.

934
00:57:36.507 --> 00:57:38.107
Like Eric Stoltz.

935
00:57:38.141 --> 00:57:39.783
Okay, why do you keep saying,
"Eric Stoltz"?

936
00:57:39.807 --> 00:57:41.140
Eric Stoltz is Marty McFly.

937
00:57:41.173 --> 00:57:42.474
- What?
- Time travel?

938
00:57:42.507 --> 00:57:44.940
Oh. We talking "BTTF"?

939
00:57:44.973 --> 00:57:46.074
Come on, who is this guy?

940
00:57:46.107 --> 00:57:47.473
Okay, yeah, no, I know.

941
00:57:47.507 --> 00:57:49.307
I've seen all of them

942
00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:51.974
and Eric Stoltz
is not Marty McFly.

943
00:57:52.007 --> 00:57:53.007
Really?

944
00:57:54.807 --> 00:57:56.440
Then explain Marty McThigh here.

945
00:57:56.473 --> 00:57:58.040
I can't explain that to you,
Gary.

946
00:57:58.073 --> 00:57:59.874
That's not your thigh.

947
00:57:59.907 --> 00:58:02.140
It's the wrong actor,
and it's upside down.

948
00:58:03.774 --> 00:58:05.208
Is it?

949
00:58:07.807 --> 00:58:09.208
The point is that

950
00:58:09.241 --> 00:58:10.940
in <i>Back to the Future</i>

951
00:58:10.973 --> 00:58:14.307
Marty McFly is very famously
played by Michael J. Fox.

952
00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:15.775
The guy from <i>Footloose?</i>

953
00:58:15.807 --> 00:58:17.341
No, that's Kevin Bacon!

954
00:58:17.374 --> 00:58:19.207
- Bacon.
- Kevin Bacon's Maverick

955
00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.950
with the volleyball, the
gay guys, and the planes?

956
00:58:20.974 --> 00:58:22.907
<i>- Top Gun.
- ♪ Great balls of fire! ♪</i>

957
00:58:22.941 --> 00:58:24.907
<i>- Top Gun,</i> right?
- No, no, no.

958
00:58:24.941 --> 00:58:26.974
I completely broke the universe.

959
00:58:29.274 --> 00:58:31.141
Marty McFly is Eric Stoltz.

960
00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:33.208
- Yes.
- Thank you.

961
00:58:33.241 --> 00:58:36.807
I created a world
with no met a humans.

962
00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:39.074
And now there's no one
to defend us from Zod. Albert!

963
00:58:41.273 --> 00:58:43.141
There's no Cyborg.

964
00:58:43.174 --> 00:58:45.073
There's no Aquaman.
There's no Wonder Woman.

965
00:58:45.106 --> 00:58:46.974
There's no Superman.

966
00:58:47.007 --> 00:58:48.174
There's no Batman.

967
00:58:48.208 --> 00:58:49.273
I'm Batman.

968
00:58:51.474 --> 00:58:54.341
What, you...
What did you just say?

969
00:58:54.374 --> 00:58:56.407
I'm Batman.

970
00:58:59.041 --> 00:59:00.141
Batman exists?

971
00:59:00.174 --> 00:59:01.307
- Hundo p.
- Yeah, dude.

972
00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:03.141
Nobody knows who he really is,

973
00:59:03.174 --> 00:59:05.807
- but he exists.
- Right.

974
00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:07.341
Well, uh, we...

975
00:59:07.374 --> 00:59:09.107
my cousin Barry and I,

976
00:59:09.141 --> 00:59:11.874
have to go
to that cousin's dinner.

977
00:59:11.907 --> 00:59:13.473
Now.

978
00:59:13.507 --> 00:59:15.407
But it was a pleasure to meet

979
00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:17.308
you all.

980
00:59:17.341 --> 00:59:19.908
- And Gary.
- Barry.

981
00:59:19.941 --> 00:59:21.174
- Barry.
- Gary.

982
00:59:21.208 --> 00:59:22.208
Barry!

983
00:59:42.041 --> 00:59:44.208
What, are you frickin'
kidding me with this place?

984
00:59:48.208 --> 00:59:50.074
What is this, hell?

985
00:59:59.141 --> 01:00:00.341
It's open.

986
01:00:12.374 --> 01:00:13.490
Look at all this cool shit!

987
01:00:13.502 --> 01:00:15.290
Okay, Barry, don't
touch anything in here.

988
01:00:20.274 --> 01:00:21.274
Hello?

989
01:00:22.408 --> 01:00:24.042

Bruce?

998
01:01:03.408 --> 01:01:05.041
Hey,
check this out. There's, like,

999
01:01:05.074 --> 01:01:06.942
bells connected to every room
in this house.

1000
01:01:06.975 --> 01:01:08.517
Hey, maybe we can
find this Bruce guy...

1001
01:01:08.541 --> 01:01:10.941
if we just ring
all these bells, right?

1002
01:01:10.974 --> 01:01:13.874
You don't understand how servant
bells work? Those are all the bells.

1003
01:01:13.907 --> 01:01:16.241
- You ring them from all the other places.
- What?

1004
01:01:16.274 --> 01:01:18.350
You don't have, like,
<i>Down ton Abbey</i> in your universe?

1005
01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:20.075
Downtown Abbey's?

1006

family-style restaurants?

1007
01:01:22.141 --> 01:01:24.408
They're like,
it's like cheaper Bananabee's.

01:01:24.441 --> 01:01:27.174
Oh, you know what
I'd really go for right now?

1009
01:01:27.208 --> 01:01:29.775

1010
01:01:35.874 --> 01:01:36.874

you're the same person as him...

1024
01:02:59.808 --> 01:03:02.374
- but from an alternate timeline.
- Yes.

1025
01:03:02.407 --> 01:03:03.408
In which...

1026
01:03:05.107 --> 01:03:06.408
you and I are friends?

Yeah, you're like

- Okay.
- -Well, but you're a bit...

1029
01:03:11.808 --> 01:03:13.774
you're, uh...

1030
01:03:13.807 --> 01:03:16.142
- chronologically different.
- Older.

1031
01:03:16.175 --> 01:03:18.308
That's what I can't understand.

1032
01:03:18.341 --> 01:03:21.308
I traveled back in time
from here to here.

1033
01:03:21.341 --> 01:03:24.242
Yet somehow,
everything's all changed

1034
01:03:24.275 --> 01:03:26.208
back here.

1035
01:03:26.241 --> 01:03:28.041
- Or like when you were born, so...
- -Well...

1036
01:03:28.875 --> 01:03:30.241
time isn't linear.

1037
01:03:30.274 --> 01:03:31.475
Right?

1038
01:03:31.509 --> 01:03:32.509
Right.

1039
01:03:35.241 --> 01:03:36.475
At some point

1040
01:03:36.508 --> 01:03:39.907
you probably saw a movie
that told you

1041
01:03:39.941 --> 01:03:42.042
that if you went back
and changed the past,

1042
01:03:42.075 --> 01:03:45.342
you'd create a kind of
a branched timeline, right?

1043
01:03:45.375 --> 01:03:46.708
Like, look.

1044
01:03:49.975 --> 01:03:51.974
New present

1045
01:03:52.007 --> 01:03:54.475
- and new future.
- Yeah.

1046
01:03:54.509 --> 01:03:56.341
Well, time doesn't
work like that.

1047
01:03:56.374 --> 01:03:57.807
That's not how time works.

1048
01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.841
When you go back
and change the past

1049
01:03:59.875 --> 01:04:01.907
you create a fulcrum.

1050
01:04:01.941 --> 01:04:04.875
You put yourself on a whole
nother strand of spaghetti.

1051
01:04:06.074 --> 01:04:08.409
New future. New past.

1052
01:04:10.074 --> 01:04:11.375
It's retrocausal.

1053
01:04:11.409 --> 01:04:12.841
It goes both ways.

1054
01:04:12.875 --> 01:04:15.242
Actually, it goes many ways.

1055
01:04:15.275 --> 01:04:17.208
Maybe some other time.

1056
01:04:17.241 --> 01:04:20.775
Okay, but in an ontological
paradox model, there's not...

1057
01:04:20.808 --> 01:04:23.442
What you did was
you changed the future

1058
01:04:23.475 --> 01:04:24.775
and you changed the past.

1059
01:04:25.475 --> 01:04:26.475
If a person

1060
01:04:26.509 --> 01:04:28.875
is stupid enough

1061
01:04:28.908 --> 01:04:30.308
to mess with time...

1062
01:04:30.341 --> 01:04:32.775
what you eventually
end up with is this.

1063
01:04:34.875 --> 01:04:36.808
The multiverse.

1064
01:04:36.841 --> 01:04:38.442
Some strands run

1065
01:04:38.475 --> 01:04:40.007
almost parallel.

1066
01:04:40.041 --> 01:04:42.775
There will be
inevitable intersections,

1067
01:04:42.808 --> 01:04:44.740
and others that are just...

1068
01:04:44.774 --> 01:04:46.409
wildly divergent.

1069
01:04:46.442 --> 01:04:47.442
What it is...

1070
01:04:49.074 --> 01:04:50.074
is a hot mess.

1071
01:04:51.542 --> 01:04:53.274
It's a crap shoot.

1072
01:04:53.308 --> 01:04:54.841
It's all just a crap shoot.

1073
01:04:54.875 --> 01:04:56.208
What does the parmesan mean?

1074
01:04:56.241 --> 01:04:58.142
The metaphor's over.
It's just a garnish.

1075
01:04:58.175 --> 01:05:00.108
And I'll tell ya something.

1076
01:05:00.141 --> 01:05:01.774
A person would have to be

1077
01:05:02.274 --> 01:05:03.741
an idiot

1078
01:05:03.775 --> 01:05:05.342
to play craps

1079
01:05:05.375 --> 01:05:07.275
with the space-time continuum.

1080
01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:08.942
Yeah, an idiot.

1081
01:05:10.475 --> 01:05:11.475
Here.

1082
01:05:13.775 --> 01:05:15.808
Mm.

1083
01:05:15.841 --> 01:05:18.141
Are you joking with
the chewing noises right now?

1084
01:05:18.174 --> 01:05:20.175
So, uh, you're the reason

1085
01:05:21.475 --> 01:05:22.907
this Zod character

1086
01:05:22.941 --> 01:05:25.209
is about to destroy the Earth?

1087
01:05:25.242 --> 01:05:26.274
Maybe.

1088
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:28.142
There's a guy called Superman

1089
01:05:28.175 --> 01:05:29.343
who can stop Zod?

1090
01:05:29.375 --> 01:05:31.974
- Yeah, yeah.
- And flies?

1091
01:05:32.007 --> 01:05:33.808
Shoots lasers out of his eyes?

1092
01:05:33.841 --> 01:05:35.950
Yes, he flies, and he shoots
lasers out of his eyes. Yes.

1093
01:05:35.974 --> 01:05:37.175
No one said "Superman"...

1094
01:05:38.808 --> 01:05:41.275
that might be
a little on the nose?

1095
01:05:41.310 --> 01:05:43.409
- You call yourself Batman.
- Yeah.

1096
01:05:43.442 --> 01:05:45.310
I don't call myself
Super Batman.

1097
01:05:47.241 --> 01:05:49.841
Wait, he's Batman?

1098
01:05:49.875 --> 01:05:51.841
What did you think
we were doing here?

1099
01:05:51.875 --> 01:05:54.008
I thought this was
the cousin's dinner.

1100
01:05:54.042 --> 01:05:56.509
He's... Bruce Wayne is Batman?

1101
01:05:56.542 --> 01:05:58.276
Not really. Not so much anymore.

1102
01:05:59.042 --> 01:06:00.208
You know...

1103
01:06:00.241 --> 01:06:01.708
they don't really need me.

1104
01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:05.841
Things have changed.
Gotham's now

1105
01:06:05.875 --> 01:06:07.975
one of the safest cities
in the world.

1106
01:06:08.008 --> 01:06:10.074
Well, I... I need you.
We need you.

1107
01:06:10.107 --> 01:06:11.310
In my timeline,

1108
01:06:11.343 --> 01:06:13.509
Batman's our strategist,
our leader.

1109
01:06:13.542 --> 01:06:16.242
The world needs Superman.
You're the best detective in the world.

1110
01:06:16.276 --> 01:06:18.451
You're probably the only person
who can help me find him.

1111
01:06:18.475 --> 01:06:20.042
So, will you help us?

1112
01:06:21.475 --> 01:06:22.475
Pass.

1113
01:06:27.275 --> 01:06:29.008
Like pass the salt?

1114
01:06:29.942 --> 01:06:31.074
Bruce?

1115
01:06:32.975 --> 01:06:35.008
He doesn't want to help us...

1116
01:06:35.042 --> 01:06:36.741
we're gonna use his bat shit.

1117
01:06:36.775 --> 01:06:37.775
Bat shit?

1118
01:06:39.142 --> 01:06:41.410
Yeah, his bat stuff,
his bat things.

1119
01:06:41.443 --> 01:06:42.443
Stand on that thing.

1120
01:06:45.443 --> 01:06:47.775
Okay, remember when you phased
through the floor?

1121
01:06:47.808 --> 01:06:49.174
- Yeah.
- So,

1122
01:06:49.208 --> 01:06:51.175
I need you to do that again.

1123
01:06:51.209 --> 01:06:52.942
Ow.

1124
01:06:58.476 --> 01:07:00.075
What is this place?

1125
01:08:07.908 --> 01:08:09.442
Dude!

1126
01:08:09.475 --> 01:08:13.143
This place straight beeves!

1127
01:08:13.176 --> 01:08:14.741
"Beeves"?

1128
01:08:25.775 --> 01:08:26.775
Barry!

1129
01:08:27.509 --> 01:08:29.042
I almost died

1130
01:08:29.075 --> 01:08:30.143
in an abyss!

1131
01:08:30.176 --> 01:08:33.775
12,805 Clark Kents in the US.

1132
01:08:33.808 --> 01:08:35.309
Is this what I think it is?

1133
01:08:45.376 --> 01:08:47.310
Holy shit!

1134
01:08:47.343 --> 01:08:50.741
I used to see this thing
on the news when I was a kid!

1135
01:08:50.775 --> 01:08:52.042
Okay, well...

1136
01:08:52.075 --> 01:08:53.842
refine search.

1137
01:08:53.876 --> 01:08:55.510
Date of birth.

1138
01:08:55.543 --> 01:08:58.042
- Wasn't born. He arrived.
- Oh!

1139
01:08:58.075 --> 01:09:00.210
Oh, Barry, look!

1140
01:09:00.243 --> 01:09:01.210
I'm busy.

1141
01:09:01.243 --> 01:09:03.243
With what?

1142
01:09:03.276 --> 01:09:05.841
Looking for unidentified objects
entering Earth's atmosphere

1143
01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:08.210
anywhere near Kansas
in the last 50 years.

1144
01:09:08.243 --> 01:09:10.442
He has a back door into NASA.

1145
01:09:10.475 --> 01:09:11.476
'Course he does.

1146
01:09:13.276 --> 01:09:15.908
Yeah, but Barry, check this out.

1147
01:09:15.942 --> 01:09:17.476
This bag laughs.

1148
01:09:19.143 --> 01:09:21.510
Okay, can't you
take anything seriously?

1149
01:09:21.543 --> 01:09:22.975
Stop messing around.

1150
01:09:23.008 --> 01:09:24.510
Dude, come on.

1151
01:09:24.543 --> 01:09:26.442
Have you seen this place?

1152
01:09:26.475 --> 01:09:28.176
It's amazing!

1153
01:09:28.210 --> 01:09:29.908
Hello!

1154
01:09:29.942 --> 01:09:32.742
Has the gravity of this
not sunk in for you?

1155
01:09:32.776 --> 01:09:33.817
Stop messing around, Barry.

1156
01:09:33.841 --> 01:09:35.109
I won't say it again.

1157
01:09:36.008 --> 01:09:38.076
Yeesh. Sorry, Mom.

1158
01:09:38.109 --> 01:09:40.409
Shut up. Shut up.

1159
01:09:40.442 --> 01:09:42.042
You have no idea
how lucky you are.

1160
01:09:42.443 --> 01:09:44.442
No idea!

1161
01:09:44.475 --> 01:09:47.076
You take everything for granted.
You don't even appreciate...

1162
01:09:47.109 --> 01:09:49.776
You just walk around
thinking that you're so funny

1163
01:09:49.809 --> 01:09:51.076
and so cool.

1164
01:09:51.109 --> 01:09:52.409
And it's embarrassing,

1165
01:09:52.442 --> 01:09:55.510
because you're not
any of those things!

1166
01:09:55.543 --> 01:09:57.976
Hey, screw you, man!

1167
01:09:58.009 --> 01:10:00.243
I've done nothing
but everything you've asked.

1168
01:10:00.276 --> 01:10:02.343
You made me
get struck by lightning!

1169
01:10:02.376 --> 01:10:05.043
I phased naked through the floor.
And I terrified Mrs. Johann son.

1170
01:10:05.076 --> 01:10:06.809
Now I'm probably
gonna have to move.

1171
01:10:06.842 --> 01:10:09.210
You won't even tell me
why you're here.

1172
01:10:09.243 --> 01:10:12.043
But will you at least tell me
why you're being so mean to me...

1173
01:10:12.076 --> 01:10:13.210
for no reason?

1174
01:10:13.243 --> 01:10:15.742
You used Monkey as a dartboard!

1175
01:10:16.841 --> 01:10:17.942
Wait, what?

1176
01:10:18.841 --> 01:10:19.841
Forget it.

1177
01:10:22.043 --> 01:10:24.044
The monkey? Wait...

1178
01:10:24.076 --> 01:10:27.109
So, you're mad at me
for playing with a toy?

1179
01:10:27.143 --> 01:10:29.176
It's not a toy.

1180
01:10:29.210 --> 01:10:30.875
Mom bought us that monkey.

1181
01:10:30.908 --> 01:10:32.876
'Cause she calls us Monkey.

1182
01:10:32.909 --> 01:10:35.741
She gives us monkey stuff
all the time.

1183
01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:37.510
Right.

1184
01:10:38.476 --> 01:10:39.476
Look...

1185
01:10:40.243 --> 01:10:41.443
I'm sorry.

1186
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:45.909
I'm not very good with people.

1187
01:10:45.943 --> 01:10:47.143
Even myself.

1188
01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:48.176
Oh.

1189
01:10:48.942 --> 01:10:49.976
Come on, dude.

1190
01:10:50.010 --> 01:10:51.741
You're... You're not that bad.

1191
01:10:51.775 --> 01:10:53.375
You can just be kind of a dick
sometimes.

1192
01:10:56.009 --> 01:10:58.410
But let's face it.
I am pretty obnoxious.

1193
01:10:58.443 --> 01:11:00.376
But I just get excited.

1194
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:03.076
Come on. This place
is pretty cool, right?

1195
01:11:04.009 --> 01:11:05.009
Yeah.

1196
01:11:07.410 --> 01:11:08.976
All right, well, um...

1197
01:11:10.943 --> 01:11:12.043
I'll let you work.

1198
01:11:32.044 --> 01:11:33.044
I know you're there.

1199
01:11:36.376 --> 01:11:38.143
<i>You know what I'm stuck on?</i>

1200
01:11:38.176 --> 01:11:40.809
<i>That thing you said,
with the spaghetti.</i>

1201
01:11:40.842 --> 01:11:43.775
<i>You said there were certain intersections
that would always be inevitable.</i>

1202
01:11:45.343 --> 01:11:46.842
You had an Alfred.

1203
01:11:46.876 --> 01:11:48.977
<i>My Bruce has an Alfred.</i>

1204
01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:51.109
<i>Different worlds,
different times...</i>

1205
01:11:51.143 --> 01:11:53.311
<i>yet there it is.</i>

1206
01:11:53.344 --> 01:11:55.476
<i>Certain people,</i>

1207
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:59.243
<i>certain events,
certain strands of spaghetti,</i>

1208
01:11:59.276 --> 01:12:01.876
<i>drawn to each other
like... like magnets.</i>

1209
01:12:02.944 --> 01:12:04.343
<i>I've read all about</i>

1210
01:12:04.376 --> 01:12:07.376
<i>temporal paradoxes
and causal loops.</i>

1211
01:12:08.543 --> 01:12:10.776
But this is more than that.

1212
01:12:10.809 --> 01:12:13.043
<i>Inevitable intersections</i>

1213
01:12:13.076 --> 01:12:14.818
<i>are something none of the theories
could have anticipated 'cause,</i>

1214
01:12:14.842 --> 01:12:17.310
<i>well, how do you explain that
except for...</i>

1215
01:12:18.977 --> 01:12:20.510
<i>fate?</i>

1216
01:12:20.543 --> 01:12:22.510
<i>If you are listening,</i>

1217
01:12:22.543 --> 01:12:24.809
<i>sorry about your parents.</i>

1218
01:12:24.842 --> 01:12:26.176
<i>I'm just trying to save mine.</i>

1219
01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:30.176
<i>There has to be a way.</i>

1220
01:12:30.210 --> 01:12:31.944
<i>There is a way, Barry.</i>

1221
01:12:31.977 --> 01:12:33.176
<i>Just keep trying.</i>

1222
01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:34.343
<i>Keep trying, Barry.</i>

1223
01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:19.944
Found him.

1224
01:13:19.977 --> 01:13:21.976
Barry, wake up.

1225
01:13:22.009 --> 01:13:25.809
Clark's being held by a mercenary
group in a Siberian black site.

1226
01:13:25.843 --> 01:13:26.843
Get up, Barry.

1227
01:13:26.876 --> 01:13:28.809
The goat's on fire.

1228
01:13:28.843 --> 01:13:30.243
We're going to Russia.

1229
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:33.211
Sweet.

1230
01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:37.443
Mm. Coffee.

1231
01:13:37.476 --> 01:13:38.877
How are we gonna get to Russia?

1232
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:18.741
I'll help you get this Superman.

1233
01:14:18.776 --> 01:14:21.143
Then, you're on your own.

1234
01:14:23.411 --> 01:14:25.110
Oh!

1235
01:14:26.410 --> 01:14:27.411
You're...

1236
01:14:28.344 --> 01:14:29.742
You are, you're...

1237
01:14:34.044 --> 01:14:35.044
Yeah.

1238
01:14:36.877 --> 01:14:37.977
I'm Batman.

1239
01:15:25.777 --> 01:15:27.743
So, what's the plan?
We're just gonna, what,

1240
01:15:27.777 --> 01:15:30.343
grab Superman and dip set
before the block is hot?

1241
01:15:30.376 --> 01:15:31.777
I don't know.

1242
01:15:31.810 --> 01:15:32.944
Hey, you should ask him.

1243
01:15:34.443 --> 01:15:35.910
- You ask him.
- You should ask him.

1244
01:15:35.944 --> 01:15:37.510
Yeah, I'm not gonna ask him.

1245
01:15:37.543 --> 01:15:39.186
Why not? I thought Batman
was supposed to be your friend.

1246
01:15:39.210 --> 01:15:41.344
Not this one. Not this Batman.

1247
01:15:41.377 --> 01:15:43.110
- We're here.
<i>- Activating hover mode.</i>

1248
01:15:48.910 --> 01:15:50.810
<i>- Ejector seat on.</i>
- Ejector seat.

1249
01:15:50.843 --> 01:15:53.177
Ejector seat.

1250
01:15:56.843 --> 01:15:58.311
Okay, there are stages.

1251
01:15:59.944 --> 01:16:01.443
You're strapped
to your parachutes.

1252
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:05.343
Hey, where's yours?

1253
01:16:16.211 --> 01:16:18.210
Whoo! This rips dicks!

1254
01:16:38.044 --> 01:16:39.843
All clear. Let's move.

1255
01:16:55.476 --> 01:16:57.109
Okay!

1256
01:17:05.476 --> 01:17:08.244
Good. Everybody's fast now
but me.

1257
01:17:08.277 --> 01:17:10.910
- Why is it so cold?
- It's the Arctic, Barry.

1258
01:17:13.410 --> 01:17:16.377
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know. Just follow the footprints.

1259
01:17:21.543 --> 01:17:23.711
Superman would be down there
for sure.

1260
01:18:05.778 --> 01:18:07.311
Yeah. Okay.

1261
01:18:35.077 --> 01:18:36.511
What did you do?

1262
01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:38.511
I had to move you.
But I just did it a little.

1263
01:18:47.443 --> 01:18:48.844
This might hurt.

1264
01:18:57.111 --> 01:18:58.244
Just let it out.

1265
01:19:35.410 --> 01:19:36.844
Let's go.

1266
01:19:44.411 --> 01:19:46.512
That's where you keep Superman.

1267
01:19:46.545 --> 01:19:47.777
Like a big scrotum.

1268
01:19:59.810 --> 01:20:02.977
He's gonna hack the Soviet security
cyberscrotum with a flip phone?

1269
01:20:08.177 --> 01:20:09.810
I tried all the combinations.

1270
01:20:12.810 --> 01:20:13.843
Yes!

1271
01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:57.011
Shit.

1272
01:20:58.145 --> 01:20:59.145
Kal-El?

1273
01:21:02.145 --> 01:21:04.244
It's not him. We've gotta go.

1274
01:21:04.277 --> 01:21:06.078
Wait.

1275
01:21:06.111 --> 01:21:08.144
We can't just leave her here.
Look at her.

1276
01:21:09.478 --> 01:21:11.878
I'll grab her. Just go!

1277
01:21:19.145 --> 01:21:20.311
I got you.

1278
01:21:39.144 --> 01:21:40.145
I'll handle this jabroni.

1279
01:21:45.878 --> 01:21:47.977
What the...

1280
01:21:55.977 --> 01:21:57.413
Barry! Somebody shot me!

1281
01:22:02.312 --> 01:22:03.977
Time to dip set!

1282
01:22:13.144 --> 01:22:14.413
You, you lead the way!

1283
01:22:14.446 --> 01:22:17.244
- Go!
- Not that way! Not that way!

1284
01:22:28.512 --> 01:22:29.910
Oh, God!

1285
01:22:29.944 --> 01:22:31.479
Cover!

1286
01:22:39.177 --> 01:22:40.313
No!

1287
01:22:48.211 --> 01:22:49.491
It's coming around.
Hurry, hurry.

1288
01:22:58.011 --> 01:23:00.711
No, no, no! This is bullshit!

1289
01:23:09.978 --> 01:23:11.512
No!

1290
01:23:11.545 --> 01:23:12.911
Come on.

1291
01:23:13.345 --> 01:23:14.744
Let's go.

1292
01:23:16.245 --> 01:23:17.843
You didn't tell me
we could get shot!

1293
01:23:17.877 --> 01:23:19.157
Why would you assume
we couldn't?

1294
01:23:30.810 --> 01:23:34.144
Oh, great! To die
at the feet of a Sputnik.

1295
01:23:39.010 --> 01:23:41.111
Oh, man! I need this knee!

1296
01:23:41.145 --> 01:23:43.212
- Stay calm. It'll heal.
- Come on.

1297
01:23:56.177 --> 01:23:57.379
- How much do you weigh?
- 180.

1298
01:23:57.413 --> 01:23:59.111
Each. Plus her, 440.

1299
01:24:06.011 --> 01:24:07.078
Hold on.

1300
01:24:36.413 --> 01:24:37.811
Oh, great. They're here.

1301
01:24:37.844 --> 01:24:38.878
They're over here, too.

1302
01:24:38.911 --> 01:24:40.145
Smirnoff Ice.

1303
01:24:40.179 --> 01:24:41.778
- Yes. Smirnoff Ice.
- Hi.

1304
01:24:41.811 --> 01:24:43.878
Stop them!

1305
01:24:43.911 --> 01:24:45.751
- Yep.
- Okay, they're serious. Barry, shut up.

1306
01:24:45.778 --> 01:24:46.878
Yeah, okay.

1307
01:24:46.911 --> 01:24:48.044
What's the play?

1308
01:24:48.077 --> 01:24:49.357
Batman, what do we do? What now?

1309
01:24:53.945 --> 01:24:54.945
Now...

1310
01:24:55.878 --> 01:24:57.045
we try not to die.

1311
01:25:56.879 --> 01:25:59.378
Oh, you guys should've
seen that in slo-mo.

1312
01:26:36.313 --> 01:26:39.446
Yeah, I'm just realizing that I
didn't really think this through.

1313
01:26:39.479 --> 01:26:41.146
There are good Kryptonians...

1314
01:26:41.179 --> 01:26:43.478
and then there are very,
very bad Kryptonians.

1315
01:26:43.512 --> 01:26:45.112
And I was very confident

1316
01:26:45.146 --> 01:26:46.744
that we were just
gonna find Superman,

1317
01:26:46.778 --> 01:26:48.745
and if we found Superman,

1318
01:26:48.779 --> 01:26:50.379
then this would all be
super simple.

1319
01:26:50.413 --> 01:26:52.346
- Who are you?
- Holy Funyuns.

1320
01:26:54.179 --> 01:26:55.279
Hi.

1321
01:26:55.313 --> 01:26:57.479
- I... I'm Barry.
- We're Barry.

1322
01:26:57.513 --> 01:27:00.213
We were trying to find Kal-El.

1323
01:27:00.246 --> 01:27:02.313
But we found you instead.

1324
01:27:02.346 --> 01:27:03.945
What do you want with Kal-El?

1325
01:27:03.978 --> 01:27:05.413
We were trying to rescue him.

1326
01:27:05.446 --> 01:27:07.279
Why?

1327
01:27:07.313 --> 01:27:10.146
Because he's my friend.

1328
01:27:10.179 --> 01:27:11.479
Do you... Do you know him?

1329
01:27:11.513 --> 01:27:13.812
She looks mad. Get ready.

1330
01:27:13.845 --> 01:27:16.122
She might do laser vision, or
she might do, like, a freezy breath...

1331
01:27:16.146 --> 01:27:18.779
- or she'll just start throwing crazy...
- My name is Kara.

1332
01:27:19.811 --> 01:27:20.978
Daughter of Zor-El.

1333
01:27:21.911 --> 01:27:23.379
Kal-El was my cousin.

1334
01:27:23.413 --> 01:27:25.878
- Right, and who's Kal-El again?
- It's Superman.

1335
01:27:25.911 --> 01:27:28.446
- No, 'cause you said that was Clark.
- Who's Clark?

1336
01:27:28.479 --> 01:27:31.812
Clark is his human name.

1337
01:27:31.845 --> 01:27:32.945
Clark.

1338
01:27:36.012 --> 01:27:37.911
He was an infant when we left.

1339
01:27:39.213 --> 01:27:40.911
The last son of Krypton... I...

1340
01:27:42.911 --> 01:27:44.279
I was sent to protect him.

1341
01:27:44.313 --> 01:27:46.279
It looks like
he never made it to Earth

1342
01:27:46.313 --> 01:27:48.279
in this universe.

1343
01:27:48.313 --> 01:27:50.811
Our pods,
they must have separated.

1344
01:27:50.844 --> 01:27:52.379
Wait, so you thought a baby

1345
01:27:52.413 --> 01:27:54.979
was gonna protect us
from this Zod guy?

1346
01:27:55.012 --> 01:27:56.445
General Zod is here.

1347
01:27:56.479 --> 01:27:58.811
He must have tracked
my pod's signal.

1348
01:27:58.844 --> 01:28:01.080
- I have to go.
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

1349
01:28:01.113 --> 01:28:04.811
Well, you need to recover
your strength. Actually, Barry...

1350
01:28:04.844 --> 01:28:06.246
take her to the roof

1351
01:28:06.279 --> 01:28:08.279
and put her in the sun.

1352
01:28:08.313 --> 01:28:09.745
Yeah.

1353
01:28:09.779 --> 01:28:11.744
- Yeah.
- Whatever, like if, I mean,

1354
01:28:11.778 --> 01:28:13.213
you're solar powered.

1355
01:28:13.246 --> 01:28:14.879
Good for you.
I've been trying to...

1356
01:28:14.912 --> 01:28:16.246
Oh, uh...

1357
01:28:17.379 --> 01:28:19.812
We'll take that with us.

1358
01:28:28.778 --> 01:28:31.379
Um, am I cool to...

1359
01:28:31.413 --> 01:28:32.413
turn around?

1360
01:28:33.413 --> 01:28:34.878
Are you dressed

1361
01:28:34.911 --> 01:28:37.012
in a red cape?

1362
01:28:43.478 --> 01:28:45.779
You're levitating?

1363
01:28:53.146 --> 01:28:54.413
Is it always this loud?

1364
01:28:57.413 --> 01:28:59.313
Is it loud?

1365
01:28:59.346 --> 01:29:02.779
Are you, uh, good?
Do you feel, um...

1366
01:29:02.812 --> 01:29:03.979
strong yet, or...

1367
01:29:09.947 --> 01:29:11.279
Yep, that seems, uh,

1368
01:29:11.313 --> 01:29:13.112
seems strong. You know...

1369
01:29:13.146 --> 01:29:15.845
old man Barry, down there,

1370
01:29:15.879 --> 01:29:18.080
says if we don't stop
Captain Zode,

1371
01:29:18.113 --> 01:29:20.379
he'll kill thousands of people.

1372
01:29:20.413 --> 01:29:22.012
Billions of people.

1373
01:29:22.046 --> 01:29:23.113
Billions?

1374
01:29:24.811 --> 01:29:26.079
Of your people.

1375
01:29:26.112 --> 01:29:27.880
- They're good people.
- Good people?

1376
01:29:29.012 --> 01:29:30.745
We came to this planet

1377
01:29:30.779 --> 01:29:32.779
looking for
a safe place to live,

1378
01:29:32.812 --> 01:29:34.980
and they put me in a cage.

1379
01:29:35.013 --> 01:29:37.745
Yeah. A lot of humans are dicks.

1380
01:29:37.778 --> 01:29:40.047
But then

1381
01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:42.346
there's babies and ballerinas.

1382
01:29:42.379 --> 01:29:44.214
And entertainment wrestlers.

1383
01:29:44.247 --> 01:29:45.812
A lot of humans
are worth saving.

1384
01:29:46.912 --> 01:29:48.080
Maybe to you.

1385
01:29:49.379 --> 01:29:50.845
But I'm not a human.

1386
01:29:52.214 --> 01:29:53.446
I'm a Kryptonian.

1387
01:29:57.214 --> 01:29:59.012
She's gone.

1388
01:29:59.046 --> 01:30:00.812
I have to get my powers back.

1389
01:30:03.446 --> 01:30:04.913
If I can re-create the accident

1390
01:30:04.947 --> 01:30:06.346
that gave me my powers...

1391
01:30:06.379 --> 01:30:07.955
maybe I can reconnect
to the Speed Force...

1392
01:30:07.979 --> 01:30:10.812
and maybe we'd stand a chance
against Zod.

1393
01:30:10.846 --> 01:30:13.179
Or kill yourself in the process.

1394
01:30:16.179 --> 01:30:17.179
Tell me something.

1395
01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:21.079
If you get your powers back,

1396
01:30:21.112 --> 01:30:22.347
you can go anywhere.

1397
01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:24.013
You can go to another timeline,

1398
01:30:24.047 --> 01:30:25.379
another universe.

1399
01:30:25.413 --> 01:30:27.745
Why do you wanna stay...

1400
01:30:27.779 --> 01:30:30.012
and fight to save this one?

1401
01:30:30.046 --> 01:30:32.313
Because this is the world
where my mom lives.

1402
01:30:35.513 --> 01:30:38.279
I went back in time to save her.

1403
01:30:38.313 --> 01:30:40.413
I'm not gonna lose her again.

1404
01:30:40.446 --> 01:30:42.346
The kid doesn't know, does he?

1405
01:30:42.379 --> 01:30:45.147
How do you tell someone
something like that?

1406
01:30:48.779 --> 01:30:50.779
I lost my parents...

1407
01:30:53.546 --> 01:30:55.246
but that pain...

1408
01:30:58.979 --> 01:31:00.479
made me who I am.

1409
01:31:00.513 --> 01:31:03.079
I'm not sure I know who I am
without it, actually.

1410
01:31:07.313 --> 01:31:10.113
I spent a lifetime...

1411
01:31:10.147 --> 01:31:13.012
trying to right
the wrongs of the past.

1412
01:31:14.314 --> 01:31:15.513
As if

1413
01:31:15.546 --> 01:31:18.414
putting on a cape
and fighting crime

1414
01:31:18.447 --> 01:31:20.313
would bring my parents back.

1415
01:31:26.247 --> 01:31:27.712
You actually did it.

1416
01:31:28.947 --> 01:31:30.479
So...

1417
01:31:30.514 --> 01:31:32.013
I guess the plan is

1418
01:31:32.047 --> 01:31:34.313
to douse yourself
in industrial chemicals

1419
01:31:34.346 --> 01:31:36.214
while electrocuting yourself?

1420
01:31:36.247 --> 01:31:37.247
Yep.

1421
01:31:41.313 --> 01:31:42.513
Want some help?

1422
01:31:44.414 --> 01:31:46.912
Hell yeah.
That would be incredibly useful.

1423
01:31:46.946 --> 01:31:48.456
I've actually already
borrowed some chemicals

1424
01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:49.846
and your soldering iron,

1425
01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:52.013
and I'm sitting
in your bat-seat.

1426
01:31:52.047 --> 01:31:53.379
Is that like a faux pas?

1427
01:32:05.347 --> 01:32:08.812
<i>Wilco, Lima,
Zebra, be advised...</i>

1428
01:32:12.813 --> 01:32:14.780
<i>Air Command to Bravo 601.</i>

1429
01:32:14.813 --> 01:32:17.146
<i>Primary teams,
please confirm your AORs.</i>

1430
01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:37.980
- Green teams ready to move.
- -Standing by!

1431
01:32:39.913 --> 01:32:43.813
<i>You bring me nothing? Hmm.</i>

1432
01:32:43.846 --> 01:32:46.179
<i>I gave you a warning.</i>

1433
01:32:46.213 --> 01:32:48.947
<i>Your failure to deliver
the Kryptonian traitor</i>

1434
01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:51.112
<i>is being taken as an act of war.</i>

1435
01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:56.123
- Fire, fire, fire!
<i>- We have contact, contact!</i>

1436
01:32:56.147 --> 01:32:56.880
<i>Weapons hot!
Weapons hot! Open fire!</i>

1437
01:32:56.913 --> 01:32:59.213
No.

1438
01:32:59.246 --> 01:33:02.013
<i>Air support now!
I repeat, air support!</i>

1439
01:33:29.313 --> 01:33:31.480
Okay, when I throw the switch,

1440
01:33:31.514 --> 01:33:33.147
the current should
run up the wire

1441
01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:35.813
and draw the lightning
right to the kite.

1442
01:33:35.846 --> 01:33:37.113
Here, put that on.

1443
01:33:37.147 --> 01:33:38.513
It's heat and impact resistant.

1444
01:33:38.546 --> 01:33:40.280
Should protect you a little.

1445
01:33:40.314 --> 01:33:42.314
Right, but the point is
for me to not be protected.

1446
01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:44.880
Okay.

1447
01:33:47.479 --> 01:33:49.247
You're gonna need
to be out of the way.

1448
01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:50.280
I will.

1449
01:33:54.813 --> 01:33:55.813
Let's get electrocuted.

1450
01:34:01.780 --> 01:34:03.180
This is going to work, right?

1451
01:34:03.214 --> 01:34:05.013
Of course it's gonna work.

1452
01:34:05.047 --> 01:34:06.813
Nothing we haven't done before.

1453
01:34:06.846 --> 01:34:08.446
Besides, this time
we have Batman.

1454
01:34:08.479 --> 01:34:10.080
What could go wrong?

1455
01:34:10.113 --> 01:34:12.180
Uh, for the record,
I think this is insane.

1456
01:34:13.913 --> 01:34:14.913
Get back.

1457
01:34:20.846 --> 01:34:21.847
It's fine. It's fine.

1458
01:34:31.813 --> 01:34:33.880
Just you and me again,
Mr. Lightning.

1459
01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:41.780
Do it!

1460
01:35:04.113 --> 01:35:05.314
Wait, what? No!

1461
01:35:05.347 --> 01:35:07.247
No, wait! Stop! Stop!

1462
01:35:14.347 --> 01:35:16.047
Oh, God.

1463
01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:17.246
Oh, God.

1464
01:35:17.279 --> 01:35:18.279
Barry, no.

1465
01:35:21.981 --> 01:35:22.981
Go again.

1466
01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:25.313
But...

1467
01:35:25.346 --> 01:35:26.346
Please.

1468
01:35:34.548 --> 01:35:36.080
The circuit is fried.

1469
01:36:34.313 --> 01:36:35.314
I've got you.

1470
01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:09.380
Hey. Barry.

1471
01:37:10.947 --> 01:37:13.181
You're okay.
It's like last time, right?

1472
01:37:13.215 --> 01:37:14.380
So, you gotta heal now.

1473
01:37:32.415 --> 01:37:33.515
Look, look, look!

1474
01:37:33.547 --> 01:37:35.048
It's working. It's working.

1475
01:37:35.081 --> 01:37:37.047
Yeah, it's working. Yeah.

1476
01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:38.981
Yeah, he's healing.
He's healing.

1477
01:37:39.014 --> 01:37:40.847
Oh, my God. He's okay.

1478
01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:43.081
Dude, you scared
the shit out of me.

1479
01:38:26.847 --> 01:38:28.314
You're awake.

1480
01:38:28.348 --> 01:38:29.448
How you feeling?

1481
01:38:30.248 --> 01:38:31.248
Slow.

1482
01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:33.880
Maybe this will help.

1483
01:38:43.881 --> 01:38:45.880
Ooh... Ooh!

1484
01:38:46.348 --> 01:38:47.349
Yes!

1485
01:38:47.382 --> 01:38:49.980
Dude, come on! Irresistible!

1486
01:38:50.013 --> 01:38:51.747
Man, feels good to be back.

1487
01:38:51.781 --> 01:38:53.081
Yeah!

1488
01:38:53.113 --> 01:38:54.813
And what are we wearing tonight?

1489
01:38:54.846 --> 01:38:56.148
You like it?

1490
01:38:56.181 --> 01:38:58.013
I-I made it myself
out of that old Batsuit.

1491
01:38:58.047 --> 01:39:00.181
But you know, I made it
our colors and everything.

1492
01:39:00.215 --> 01:39:02.348
Well, check this out!

1493
01:39:02.381 --> 01:39:04.247
It's a bit more loose.

1494
01:39:06.781 --> 01:39:07.846
It beeves.

1495
01:39:08.981 --> 01:39:10.381
Dude...

1496
01:39:10.415 --> 01:39:11.913
you really mean that?

1497
01:39:11.947 --> 01:39:13.382
I mean, I don't...

1498
01:39:13.415 --> 01:39:16.947
I don't know what it means,
exactly, to beeve.

1499
01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:19.747
But it seems like it's positive.

1500
01:39:19.781 --> 01:39:20.781
What are you doing?

1501
01:39:23.548 --> 01:39:24.947
You came back.

1502
01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:26.981
I'm glad you're okay.

1503
01:39:27.014 --> 01:39:29.780
I have to ask you something.

1504
01:39:29.813 --> 01:39:32.281
When you found me in that hole
that they put me in...

1505
01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:35.282
and I wasn't Kal-El...

1506
01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:39.847
why did you help me?

1507
01:39:39.881 --> 01:39:41.247
Because you needed help.

1508
01:39:44.081 --> 01:39:47.114
Do you know
what this symbol stands for?

1509
01:39:47.148 --> 01:39:49.248
- Supergirl?
- It means hope, right?

1510
01:39:49.281 --> 01:39:51.382
Hope, yeah. Does it mean hope?

1511
01:39:51.416 --> 01:39:54.113
Krypton was a beautiful place.

1512
01:39:56.215 --> 01:39:57.814
We are a people of hope,

1513
01:39:58.548 --> 01:40:00.148
not war.

1514
01:40:01.781 --> 01:40:03.315
<i>I'm coming to you live
from Metropolis,</i>

1515
01:40:03.348 --> 01:40:04.990
<i>where minutes ago,
the mysterious flying...</i>

1516
01:40:05.014 --> 01:40:06.981
Zod may be from Krypton,

1517
01:40:07.013 --> 01:40:09.847
but he is not my people.

1518
01:40:09.881 --> 01:40:12.180
So, you're saying...

1519
01:40:12.214 --> 01:40:13.948
Yes.

1520
01:40:13.981 --> 01:40:15.415
I will help you fight Zod.

1521
01:40:18.316 --> 01:40:20.215
Yes!

1522
01:40:20.248 --> 01:40:22.114
Interesting group.

1523
01:40:22.148 --> 01:40:25.013
What did you say, uh...

1524
01:40:25.047 --> 01:40:26.249
we were called again?

1525
01:40:26.282 --> 01:40:28.281
We're the Justice League.

1526
01:40:28.315 --> 01:40:29.415
No.

1527
01:40:29.448 --> 01:40:32.415
- No?
- Well, I mean, kinda.

1528
01:40:33.448 --> 01:40:34.449
We are short

1529
01:40:34.482 --> 01:40:35.981
one literal goddess...

1530
01:40:36.014 --> 01:40:37.481
one friendly Terminator

1531
01:40:37.515 --> 01:40:40.282
and super mermaid.

1532
01:40:40.315 --> 01:40:42.415
And we could
definitely use a Batman.

1533
01:40:45.481 --> 01:40:46.880
Are you in?

1534
01:40:52.048 --> 01:40:53.148
You wanna get nuts?

1535
01:40:55.781 --> 01:40:57.114
Let's get nuts.

1536
01:41:10.381 --> 01:41:13.148
In my world, Superman showed up
right away when Zod called him out.

1537
01:41:13.182 --> 01:41:15.747
So, as of now,
we're in uncharted territory.

1538
01:41:15.781 --> 01:41:18.914
What I do know is that Zod
somehow controls the World Engines,

1539
01:41:18.948 --> 01:41:20.448
which will be destroying
much more

1540
01:41:20.481 --> 01:41:22.114
than just Metropolis now

1541
01:41:22.148 --> 01:41:23.957
with every passing second
that we don't stop him.

1542
01:41:23.981 --> 01:41:25.047
Barry, what are you doing?

1543
01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:26.080
What?

1544
01:41:27.448 --> 01:41:28.948
Our kids are gonna
wanna see this.

1545
01:41:28.981 --> 01:41:29.981
Your kids?

1546
01:41:32.182 --> 01:41:35.149
Well, you know, like everybody's
kids. I mean, the children of the world.

1547
01:41:35.182 --> 01:41:36.348
They're gonna wanna see this.

1548
01:41:38.981 --> 01:41:40.747
We're getting close.

1549
01:41:40.781 --> 01:41:42.791
I'm gonna stay airborne
and take out their sky power.

1550
01:41:42.814 --> 01:41:44.182
And Barry, just so we're clear

1551
01:41:44.216 --> 01:41:45.391
what that essentially equates
to is you and me

1552
01:41:45.415 --> 01:41:47.349
versus the entire
Kryptonian army.

1553
01:41:47.382 --> 01:41:48.981
Chill.

1554
01:41:49.014 --> 01:41:51.449
We need to buy Kara enough time
to take out Zod.

1555
01:41:51.482 --> 01:41:53.890
Oh, and remember that your suit
doesn't dissipate energy like mine

1556
01:41:53.914 --> 01:41:55.315
so you need to take breaks,

1557
01:41:55.348 --> 01:41:57.125
otherwise you're gonna build up
too much charge.

1558
01:41:57.149 --> 01:41:58.747
Wait, what?

1559
01:42:15.847 --> 01:42:17.249
Dang it!

1560
01:42:19.081 --> 01:42:20.747
Hold on!

1561
01:42:22.482 --> 01:42:23.847
- Okay!
- Hold on.

1562
01:42:26.115 --> 01:42:27.416
The humans we came to protect?

1563
01:42:27.449 --> 01:42:29.114
They don't know
we're on their side.

1564
01:43:04.416 --> 01:43:05.416
Zod.

1565
01:43:14.814 --> 01:43:15.981
Kara Zor-El.

1566
01:43:16.014 --> 01:43:17.449
We've been waiting for you.

1567
01:43:20.415 --> 01:43:21.914
Go, go!

1568
01:43:23.082 --> 01:43:24.082
Cover!

1569
01:43:28.082 --> 01:43:30.149
- Drag him out, drag him!
- You go! I'll cover!

1570
01:43:47.316 --> 01:43:49.948
Okay, and the space giant...

1571
01:43:49.981 --> 01:43:51.782
and Mistress Murder...

1572
01:43:51.815 --> 01:43:53.881
- are our responsibility, too?
- Hey, hey, hey.

1573
01:43:53.914 --> 01:43:55.425
Don't think about them, okay?
Calm down.

1574
01:43:55.449 --> 01:43:57.516
We're just gonna start
with those guys over there.

1575
01:43:57.549 --> 01:43:59.224
And yeah, they're Kryptonian,
and we won't be able to kill them,

1576
01:43:59.248 --> 01:44:01.149
but we can slow them down
for her.

1577
01:44:01.182 --> 01:44:03.814
One at a time.

1578
01:44:03.847 --> 01:44:06.349
Okay? I'm gonna disarm them,
and then you'll engage.

1579
01:44:08.482 --> 01:44:09.482
Punch 'em.

1580
01:44:11.115 --> 01:44:12.915
Come on, Barbie.

1581
01:44:12.949 --> 01:44:14.914
Let's go party?

1582
01:44:21.782 --> 01:44:23.115
Okay, ow!

1583
01:44:25.382 --> 01:44:26.382
Oh.

1584
01:44:31.382 --> 01:44:32.349
Okay. It's okay.

1585
01:44:32.382 --> 01:44:34.050
You're okay. Come on.

1586
01:44:34.083 --> 01:44:35.382
Jesus, they're fast.

1587
01:44:35.416 --> 01:44:37.216
Yes, but not as fast as us.

1588
01:44:41.015 --> 01:44:43.049
Terra forming has begun.

1589
01:44:43.082 --> 01:44:44.847
This world must die

1590
01:44:44.881 --> 01:44:46.915
so that ours may live again.

1591
01:44:54.548 --> 01:44:56.416
Oh, my God. We gotta go.
We gotta go.

1592
01:44:56.449 --> 01:44:58.015
Dan, Danny, go, go!

1593
01:44:59.348 --> 01:45:01.747
Krypton is gone, Zod.

1594
01:45:01.781 --> 01:45:03.149
Your uncle...

1595
01:45:03.182 --> 01:45:04.182
Jor-El...

1596
01:45:05.549 --> 01:45:06.914
hid the key

1597
01:45:06.949 --> 01:45:09.748
to Krypton's rebirth

1598
01:45:09.782 --> 01:45:12.115
inside a Kryptonian child.

1599
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:14.416
All the genetic material needed

1600
01:45:14.449 --> 01:45:16.282
to start again

1601
01:45:16.316 --> 01:45:18.216
coded inside the DNA,

1602
01:45:18.249 --> 01:45:20.949
then sent to Earth
in an escape pod.

1603
01:45:20.982 --> 01:45:22.881
He's not here. You have failed.

1604
01:45:24.115 --> 01:45:25.115
We found him.

1605
01:45:27.182 --> 01:45:29.049
We intercepted his pod.

1606
01:45:31.316 --> 01:45:33.916
But your cousin was
not the one we needed.

1607
01:45:35.782 --> 01:45:37.781
You are the one.

1608
01:45:37.814 --> 01:45:39.349
Kara Zor-El.

1609
01:45:39.382 --> 01:45:41.382
It is your blood...

1610
01:45:41.416 --> 01:45:42.516
we must harvest.

1611
01:45:42.549 --> 01:45:43.982
What did you do to Kal-El?

1612
01:45:44.015 --> 01:45:46.782
Your sacrifice that will allow

1613
01:45:46.815 --> 01:45:48.814
Krypton to live again.

1614
01:45:48.847 --> 01:45:51.715
What did you do?

1615
01:45:53.982 --> 01:45:56.715
The infant did not survive.

1616
01:46:30.116 --> 01:46:31.382
Look, new plan.

1617
01:46:31.416 --> 01:46:33.082
I'm gonna create
a cyclonic diversion.

1618
01:46:33.115 --> 01:46:34.916
And you're gonna
just come in, hard.

1619
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:35.982
Feet first this time.

1620
01:46:51.815 --> 01:46:53.282
Yes!

1621
01:46:53.316 --> 01:46:54.915
Barry, did you see that?

1622
01:46:54.949 --> 01:46:56.829
Be careful. You're accumulating
too much charge.

1623
01:46:58.316 --> 01:47:00.217
What if I just Emperor this guy?

1624
01:47:01.516 --> 01:47:03.714
No, no, no!

1625
01:47:30.449 --> 01:47:33.182
Barry, that was actually
only half stupid!

1626
01:47:33.216 --> 01:47:35.216
But if you're gonna do that
and not die,

1627
01:47:35.249 --> 01:47:37.149
you need to complete
the circuit somehow.

1628
01:47:37.182 --> 01:47:39.282
Try putting
your hands together, like this.

1629
01:47:42.182 --> 01:47:43.182
Oh, shit.

1630
01:47:45.115 --> 01:47:47.816
- You're ready.
- Let's go!

1631
01:47:58.982 --> 01:48:01.883
<i>♪ I seem to think I think
I got a little situation ♪</i>

1632
01:48:01.916 --> 01:48:04.816
<i>♪ So listen to me, sister

01:48:04.849 --> 01:48:07.882

1635
01:48:10.549 --> 01:48:13.816

1640
01:49:04.350 --> 01:49:05.950
I'm going after the big one.

1641
01:49:17.283 --> 01:49:18.283
I've been hit.

1642
01:49:21.016 --> 01:49:22.950
Bruce, do you copy?

1643
01:49:22.983 --> 01:49:24.482
- Where's Kara?
- You go find her.

1644
01:49:29.483 --> 01:49:30.483
Bruce!

1645
01:49:31.849 --> 01:49:33.883
<i>Ejection mode failure.</i>

1646
01:49:33.916 --> 01:49:35.816
<i>Ejection mode failure.</i>

1647
01:50:15.282 --> 01:50:16.983
Rest, Kara Zor-El.

1648
01:50:22.482 --> 01:50:23.883
Going down.

1649
01:50:28.915 --> 01:50:30.450
But I'm not going alone.

1650
01:50:30.483 --> 01:50:32.783
No, no, no, Bruce!

1651
01:50:32.816 --> 01:50:35.749
<i>Bruce, eject! Bruce,
just eject...</i>

1652
01:50:42.983 --> 01:50:43.983
No!

1653
01:50:55.849 --> 01:50:56.849
Kara.

1654
01:51:03.316 --> 01:51:05.150
Isn't supposed...

1655
01:51:07.216 --> 01:51:08.383
Not supposed to happen...

1656
01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:16.383
Kara's dead.

1657
01:51:16.417 --> 01:51:17.950
They're both dead.

1658
01:51:17.983 --> 01:51:19.950
But they don't have to be,
right?

1659
01:51:19.983 --> 01:51:22.317
'Cause we can go back.

1660
01:51:22.350 --> 01:51:24.482
- Like you did.
- You're not fast enough yet.

1661
01:51:24.516 --> 01:51:25.516
You sure?

1662
01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:29.417
Barry!

1663
01:51:30.883 --> 01:51:31.916
Barry, wait!

1664
01:51:45.816 --> 01:51:47.383
Is this back enough?

1665
01:51:47.417 --> 01:51:48.783
Yeah, I guess so.

1666
01:51:55.283 --> 01:51:56.916
Listen, Barry, I...

1667
01:51:58.282 --> 01:52:02.050
What? It's okay.
We can fix this.

1668
01:52:02.083 --> 01:52:03.292
You know what
you're gonna change?

1669
01:52:03.316 --> 01:52:04.849
I know what I'm gonna change.

1670
01:52:09.783 --> 01:52:11.183
I'm going after the big one.

1671
01:52:13.783 --> 01:52:16.082
Bruce, pull off. That gunship
is shield-protected.

1672
01:52:16.115 --> 01:52:17.115
Roger that.

1673
01:52:20.817 --> 01:52:21.883
Bet he's not.

1674
01:52:23.050 --> 01:52:24.884
Who? Space giant?

1675
01:52:24.917 --> 01:52:26.417
Yes, yes, please take him out.

1676
01:53:07.951 --> 01:53:08.951
Yes.

1677
01:55:08.418 --> 01:55:09.451
No.

1678
01:55:10.183 --> 01:55:11.183
Hey.

1679
01:55:12.117 --> 01:55:13.784
It'll be okay.

1680
01:55:13.817 --> 01:55:14.983
Not this time, kid.

1681
01:55:17.418 --> 01:55:19.250
Maybe some other time.

1682
01:55:25.283 --> 01:55:26.916
We can't bring you back, can we?

1683
01:55:28.451 --> 01:55:29.817
You already did.

1684
01:55:31.950 --> 01:55:33.284
You already did.

1685
01:55:43.917 --> 01:55:44.917
Come on, Barry.

1686
01:55:46.352 --> 01:55:47.984
Gotta get up. Come on.

1687
01:55:48.016 --> 01:55:49.217
- Barry.
- We go again.

1688
01:55:51.984 --> 01:55:53.749
Barry.

1689
01:55:55.384 --> 01:55:57.150
Let's just go.

1690
01:55:57.183 --> 01:55:58.884
Barry, come on. Let's just go.

1691
01:55:58.917 --> 01:56:00.284
Barry, there's no point.

1692
01:56:02.983 --> 01:56:04.284
Barry!

1693
01:56:24.384 --> 01:56:27.950
Phase!

1694
01:56:30.484 --> 01:56:33.117
Okay, I have to pull it out.

1695
01:56:33.151 --> 01:56:34.494
- I have to pull it out.
- No, I'm okay.

1696
01:56:34.518 --> 01:56:35.959
You have to phase again.
Barry, phase again.

1697
01:56:35.983 --> 01:56:37.026
I'm okay. I just
should've stopped sooner.

1698
01:56:37.050 --> 01:56:38.051
Ow!

1699
01:56:54.351 --> 01:56:55.717
Again.

1700
01:56:57.183 --> 01:56:58.183
Barry.

1701
01:57:06.849 --> 01:57:09.084
Okay, can we please
just take a minute?

1702
01:57:09.117 --> 01:57:11.784
Sorry, dude.
Yeah, bro, of course.

1703
01:57:11.817 --> 01:57:13.351
That's the whole thing.

1704
01:57:13.384 --> 01:57:15.351
We can take as much time
as it takes.

1705
01:57:15.384 --> 01:57:17.484
No, that's not what I mean. Hey!

1706
01:57:38.984 --> 01:57:41.351
Okay, you good? Come on.

1707
01:57:41.384 --> 01:57:43.219
I need you in there. Let's go.

1708
01:57:43.252 --> 01:57:45.050
Barry, please,
just listen to me!

1709
01:58:03.117 --> 01:58:04.418
Where were you?

1710
01:58:04.451 --> 01:58:06.083
What, you just stand here
the whole time?

1711
01:58:06.116 --> 01:58:09.017
Barry, this is
an inevitable intersection.

1712
01:58:09.051 --> 01:58:10.883
You have to stop. Barry!

1713
01:58:26.152 --> 01:58:27.351
No, Barry, wait!

1714
01:58:33.385 --> 01:58:35.850
Barry, listen.

1715
01:58:35.884 --> 01:58:37.284
There's something
I should tell you.

1716
01:58:39.884 --> 01:58:42.252
I went back in time initially

1717
01:58:42.285 --> 01:58:44.884
- because...
- Yeah, because Mom died.

1718
01:58:44.917 --> 01:58:46.485
How do you know?

1719
01:58:46.519 --> 01:58:49.151
It doesn't matter. Does it?

1720
01:58:49.184 --> 01:58:50.884
You know that I have to
undo what I did.

1721
01:58:51.951 --> 01:58:52.850
No.

1722
01:58:52.884 --> 01:58:54.184
It's not a mistake.

1723
01:58:54.218 --> 01:58:55.252
We can save her.

1724
01:58:55.285 --> 01:58:56.484
And we can save them.

1725
01:58:56.518 --> 01:58:58.251
No, we can't.

1726
01:58:58.284 --> 01:59:01.051
This is what
Bruce was talking about.

1727
01:59:01.084 --> 01:59:03.219
Barry, this is inevitable.

1728
01:59:03.252 --> 01:59:05.932
We can try a million times, and
we're not gonna be able to fix this.

1729
01:59:06.518 --> 01:59:08.051
No matter what we do...

1730
01:59:08.784 --> 01:59:10.484
this world dies.

1731
01:59:11.451 --> 01:59:13.418
Today.

1732
01:59:13.451 --> 01:59:14.451
Look around.

1733
01:59:18.784 --> 01:59:20.817
Look at the damage
we're causing.

1734
01:59:26.917 --> 01:59:28.117
Now we have to stop.

1735
01:59:28.151 --> 01:59:29.419
Okay?

1736
01:59:29.452 --> 01:59:31.284
Look, I was just
doing my laundry.

1737
01:59:31.318 --> 01:59:34.419
You're the one who came and
told me that I'm a superhero.

1738
01:59:34.452 --> 01:59:36.318
And now you're saying what?

1739
01:59:36.351 --> 01:59:38.252
You don't want me to be?

1740
01:59:38.285 --> 01:59:40.884
Well, guess what! It's too late!

1741
01:59:40.917 --> 01:59:43.419
I am...

1742
01:59:43.451 --> 01:59:45.017
the Flash.

1743
01:59:45.052 --> 01:59:46.951
And I can save everyone.

1744
01:59:46.984 --> 01:59:48.784
Nobody dies!

1745
01:59:48.817 --> 01:59:49.817
Barry...

1746
01:59:51.519 --> 01:59:53.351
not every problem
has a solution.

1747
02:00:02.418 --> 02:00:04.319
Not every problem
has a solution.

1748
02:00:08.452 --> 02:00:09.984
Sometimes we just
have to let go.

1749
02:00:10.017 --> 02:00:12.252
<i>Sometimes you just
have to let go.</i>

1750
02:00:12.285 --> 02:00:14.984
Let go of Mom?

1751
02:00:15.017 --> 02:00:18.252
She'll always be alive,
somewhere in time.

1752
02:00:19.418 --> 02:00:20.419
Always.

1753
02:00:21.185 --> 02:00:22.285
Just not for us.

1754
02:00:23.451 --> 02:00:25.750
You're full of shit, dude.

1755
02:00:25.784 --> 02:00:27.085
I'm going back.

1756
02:00:27.118 --> 02:00:28.984
You're going back to kill Mom?

1757
02:00:29.018 --> 02:00:30.152
No!

1758
02:00:30.185 --> 02:00:31.984
You're staying!

1759
02:00:32.018 --> 02:00:34.018
You stay, right here.

1760
02:00:35.418 --> 02:00:37.018
Just give me one more time.

1761
02:00:37.051 --> 02:00:38.850
Barry, stop!

1762
02:00:38.884 --> 02:00:41.251
You, stop!

1763
02:01:12.552 --> 02:01:14.784
Feel like we got off
on the wrong foot.

1764
02:01:14.817 --> 02:01:17.385
Let's start again.
I'm the Flash.

1765
02:01:17.419 --> 02:01:18.451
What's your name?

1766
02:01:18.484 --> 02:01:21.118
I've lived...

1767
02:01:21.152 --> 02:01:23.085
more than you can dream.

1768
02:01:23.118 --> 02:01:25.784
Not an answer.

1769
02:01:25.817 --> 02:01:27.484
Do you, like, rehearse that?

1770
02:01:32.986 --> 02:01:34.385
Whoa.

1771
02:01:34.419 --> 02:01:35.884
Get out of here, Barry!

1772
02:01:50.519 --> 02:01:52.252
That scar, you...

1773
02:01:53.384 --> 02:01:54.384
Oh, my God.

1774
02:01:55.252 --> 02:01:57.884
So, you're... You are...

1775
02:01:57.918 --> 02:01:59.419
Yes, I am...

1776
02:02:00.052 --> 02:02:01.052
you.

1777
02:02:04.018 --> 02:02:05.985
We are so close.

1778
02:02:06.018 --> 02:02:07.985
I've got it almost figured out.

1779
02:02:08.018 --> 02:02:10.985
How long
have you been doing this?

1780
02:02:11.018 --> 02:02:13.452
Time is inconsequential.

1781
02:02:13.485 --> 02:02:14.485
Come on, Barry.

1782
02:02:24.118 --> 02:02:26.817
<i>Up in the sky! It's a bird!</i>

1783
02:02:26.850 --> 02:02:28.152
<i>It's a plane!</i>

1784
02:02:28.185 --> 02:02:29.751
<i>It's Superman!</i>

1785
02:03:11.919 --> 02:03:13.519
<i>Purrfectly foolproof.</i>

1786
02:03:15.451 --> 02:03:16.886
<i>Only the Joker
would think of that.</i>

1787
02:03:55.219 --> 02:03:57.352
Please just look at
what's happening.

1788
02:03:58.852 --> 02:03:59.852
These worlds...

1789
02:04:08.919 --> 02:04:11.018
they're colliding
and collapsing.

1790
02:04:13.319 --> 02:04:14.419
We did this.

1791
02:04:16.419 --> 02:04:18.851
W-We're destroying
the fabric of everything.

1792
02:04:21.152 --> 02:04:22.319
You have to stop.

1793
02:04:22.352 --> 02:04:25.219
It stops once I've fixed it!

1794
02:04:26.952 --> 02:04:29.986
It's not entirely your fault,
Barry.

1795
02:04:30.019 --> 02:04:33.519
I pushed you out of the
Chronobowl on that September 29

1796
02:04:33.552 --> 02:04:36.886
so you could start me
on this path. Hmm?

1797
02:04:36.919 --> 02:04:39.419
How do you like
our endless paradox?

1798
02:04:39.452 --> 02:04:41.786
I made you create me...

1799
02:04:42.819 --> 02:04:44.485
and now you're the one...

1800
02:04:45.352 --> 02:04:47.252
in my way.

1801
02:04:47.285 --> 02:04:50.253
No matter how close I get
to winning this fight...

1802
02:04:50.286 --> 02:04:52.285
you go back

1803
02:04:52.319 --> 02:04:54.119
and let Mom die.

1804
02:04:54.153 --> 02:04:56.285
You're the inevitable
intersection.

1805
02:04:57.285 --> 02:04:59.519
And you do have to let go.

1806
02:04:59.552 --> 02:05:01.717
What's he talking about?

1807
02:05:02.819 --> 02:05:04.119
You're my hero.

1808
02:05:17.319 --> 02:05:19.786
What did you do?

1809
02:05:19.819 --> 02:05:22.385
Hey, hey. Don't worry.
It's gonna heal.

1810
02:05:22.419 --> 02:05:23.452
It's gonna heal.

1811
02:05:23.485 --> 02:05:25.186
I just wanted to...

1812
02:05:42.986 --> 02:05:44.419
You tell Mom I love her.

1813
02:06:56.053 --> 02:06:57.385
Don't forget the tomatoes.

1814
02:07:10.419 --> 02:07:13.019
I used to love that cereal
when I was a kid.

1815
02:07:13.485 --> 02:07:15.052
Yeah.

1816
02:07:15.085 --> 02:07:16.786
My son goes nuts for it.

1817
02:07:21.153 --> 02:07:23.185
They stop making it.

1818
02:07:23.219 --> 02:07:25.953
Well, I know they were
talking about discontinuing it.

1819
02:07:25.986 --> 02:07:28.420
- Do I know you?
- No, I'm not from around here.

1820
02:07:28.453 --> 02:07:30.485
I was just visiting my mom.

1821
02:07:30.519 --> 02:07:31.985
Maybe I know her.

1822
02:07:32.018 --> 02:07:33.186
What's her name?

1823
02:07:34.119 --> 02:07:36.219
She's the best...

1824
02:07:36.252 --> 02:07:38.220
and kindest person in the world.

1825
02:07:38.953 --> 02:07:39.852
You okay?

1826
02:07:39.886 --> 02:07:41.852
Yeah, I'm just...

1827
02:07:41.886 --> 02:07:42.926
I'm really gonna miss her.

1828
02:08:04.253 --> 02:08:05.919
I know I'm just...

1829
02:08:05.953 --> 02:08:08.019
a random lady in a store.

1830
02:08:08.053 --> 02:08:09.153
But do you want a hug?

1831
02:08:10.118 --> 02:08:11.119
Mm-hmm. Sure.

1832
02:08:17.220 --> 02:08:19.852
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, don't say that.

1833
02:08:21.786 --> 02:08:24.886
Your mom must be grateful
you came to visit her.

1834
02:08:24.919 --> 02:08:26.786
She's very lucky to have you.

1835
02:08:34.386 --> 02:08:36.385
I'm very lucky to have her.

1836
02:08:36.419 --> 02:08:40.053
Ah! You have to tell her that.

1837
02:08:40.086 --> 02:08:41.886
Moms like to hear
these kind of things.

1838
02:08:43.019 --> 02:08:44.019
Believe me.

1839
02:09:23.152 --> 02:09:24.353
Love you, Mom.

1840
02:09:32.219 --> 02:09:33.386
I love you more.

1841
02:09:35.486 --> 02:09:37.186
I loved you first.

1842
02:09:42.420 --> 02:09:43.520
Bye.

1843
02:09:43.553 --> 02:09:44.819
Bye.

1844
02:10:17.919 --> 02:10:19.086
I'm back.

1845
02:10:29.454 --> 02:10:30.454
Shit!

1846
02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:32.954
Court!

1847
02:10:41.986 --> 02:10:44.119
Original trial was initially...

1848
02:10:47.286 --> 02:10:48.353
I'm so sorry.

1849
02:10:52.819 --> 02:10:55.253
As I was saying...

1850
02:10:55.286 --> 02:10:57.752
the same
security camera footage,

1851
02:10:57.786 --> 02:10:59.752
Exhibit F in the original trial,

1852
02:10:59.786 --> 02:11:01.420
was initially
considered useless,

1853
02:11:01.453 --> 02:11:03.253
but has now

1854
02:11:03.286 --> 02:11:05.086
been enhanced,

1855
02:11:05.119 --> 02:11:07.286
using the latest tech

1856
02:11:07.320 --> 02:11:08.786
from Wayne Enterprises.

1857
02:11:09.852 --> 02:11:10.852
It confirms

1858
02:11:11.220 --> 02:11:12.752
the alibi

1859
02:11:12.786 --> 02:11:14.886
Mr. Allen has argued,

1860
02:11:14.919 --> 02:11:16.253
and his son, Barry,

1861
02:11:17.387 --> 02:11:20.253
has corroborated, since day one.

1862
02:11:26.186 --> 02:11:27.186
Here.

1863
02:11:30.852 --> 02:11:34.421
Right here, you can clearly see
my client, Mr. Allen,

1864
02:11:34.454 --> 02:11:37.521
reaching for a can of tomatoes

1865
02:11:37.554 --> 02:11:39.354
on the top shelf.

1866
02:11:57.354 --> 02:11:59.363
Mr. Allen, Mr. Allen, can you tell us a
bit more about what happened, please?

1867
02:11:59.387 --> 02:12:01.453
Well, um...

1868
02:12:01.486 --> 02:12:04.220
the tomatoes moved from
the bottom shelf to the top shelf,

1869
02:12:04.253 --> 02:12:05.852
and subsequently,

1870
02:12:05.886 --> 02:12:07.986
uncooked the spaghetti.

1871
02:12:09.086 --> 02:12:10.086
Unquote.

1872
02:12:12.387 --> 02:12:15.330
I'm sorry, that makes absolutely no
sense. What are you talking about, sir?

1873
02:12:15.354 --> 02:12:18.186
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- The allegations, the trial...

1874
02:12:18.220 --> 02:12:20.220
We're good here. Thank you.

1875
02:12:20.253 --> 02:12:22.454
Statement in the court.

1876
02:12:22.487 --> 02:12:24.753
- Did I give a good quote?
- Yeah.

1877
02:12:24.787 --> 02:12:26.819
Spaghetti.

1878
02:12:26.852 --> 02:12:29.186
Hey, speaking of food,
I was thinking, um...

1879
02:12:31.186 --> 02:12:32.387
you should ask me to dinner.

1880
02:12:33.487 --> 02:12:34.919
D-Dinner with me?

1881
02:12:34.953 --> 02:12:37.487
Yes, a date, Barry.

1882
02:12:37.521 --> 02:12:40.387
Iris West,
do you wanna dinner-date me?

1883
02:12:40.421 --> 02:12:41.853
- I'd love to.
- Thank you.

1884
02:12:42.521 --> 02:12:43.819
I'd love to also.

1885
02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:45.720
Call me.

1886
02:13:07.187 --> 02:13:09.220
- Bruce!
<i>- Congratulations.</i>

1887
02:13:09.254 --> 02:13:12.119
Thank you. You have no idea
how good it is to hear your voice.

1888
02:13:12.153 --> 02:13:15.753
I... I have so much to tell you the next
time I see you, Bruce. You were right.

1889
02:13:15.787 --> 02:13:16.986
Okay? And I didn't listen.

1890
02:13:17.019 --> 02:13:18.953
And things did get very,
very weird,

1891
02:13:18.986 --> 02:13:21.119
but I put everything back,
I promise.

1892
02:13:21.153 --> 02:13:22.321
<i>I'm pulling up now.</i>

1893
02:13:23.521 --> 02:13:25.254
Oh, great.

1894
02:13:25.287 --> 02:13:26.986
- Get the shot.
- Sir, sir!

1895
02:13:27.019 --> 02:13:29.287
- Back up, please.
- Shot!

1896
02:13:29.321 --> 02:13:30.862
Sir, I'd like to ask you for
a video for the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

1897
02:13:30.886 --> 02:13:32.006
- Wayne! Wayne!
- Step aside.

1898
02:13:34.554 --> 02:13:36.255
Was it backed by
your own allegation?

1899
02:13:39.287 --> 02:13:40.853
Who the fuck is this?

1900
02:13:40.887 --> 02:13:42.221
He's not
answering any questions.

1901
02:13:43.487 --> 02:13:44.487
Hey, Barry.

1902
02:13:45.787 --> 02:13:47.119
No, wh-where's...

1903
02:13:47.986 --> 02:13:49.787
You're, you... No.

1904
02:13:49.820 --> 02:13:51.186
You can't...

1905
02:13:51.221 --> 02:13:53.321
You... You're not Batman.

1906
02:13:56.019 --> 02:13:57.019
What's wrong with you?

1907
02:13:58.987 --> 02:14:00.321
Huh.

1908
02:14:04.487 --> 02:14:05.521

I can't get drunk.

1939
02:15:51.936 --> 02:15:53.870
I can't get drink either.

1940
02:15:53.904 --> 02:15:56.337
Listen. Listen, I'm, 'cause
I'm trying to... No, no, no.

1941
02:15:56.371 --> 02:15:58.814
'Cause what I'm trying to explain as
simply as I possibly can, I promise...

1942
02:15:58.838 --> 02:16:01.505
They were all Batman.
They were all Bruce Wayne.

1943
02:16:01.539 --> 02:16:03.416
But each of them was
a completely different person.

1944
02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:06.773
- So, on the other line-time...
- Timeline.

1945
02:16:06.807 --> 02:16:07.807
I'm the same guy?

1946
02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:09.507
Yeah. Actually, pretty much.

1947
02:16:09.541 --> 02:16:11.341
You're lovable, furry...

1948
02:16:11.375 --> 02:16:13.642
loyal, motivated by bacon.

1949
02:16:13.675 --> 02:16:15.608
All right, listen.

1950
02:16:15.642 --> 02:16:18.409
Thank you for making it more
simpler for me, Mr. Simple More.

1951
02:16:18.443 --> 02:16:20.310
Yeah, I'm doing my best.-

1952
02:16:20.343 --> 02:16:22.377
Look, you're missing
the larger premise here.

1953
02:16:22.410 --> 02:16:25.344
In my timeline, when I...

1954
02:16:26.645 --> 02:16:28.611
All right, come on.

1955
02:16:28.645 --> 02:16:30.279
Up, up, Broseidon.

1956
02:16:30.312 --> 02:16:31.813
All right, come on.

1957
02:16:31.846 --> 02:16:33.713
I thought you were gonna
sleep on the couch.

1958
02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:35.847
Arthur, I live right here.

1959
02:16:35.880 --> 02:16:36.914
Harry?

1960
02:16:38.281 --> 02:16:39.948
I live right here. It's okay.

1961
02:16:44.649 --> 02:16:45.749
Okay.

1962
02:16:45.782 --> 02:16:47.483
Oh, hey.

1963
02:16:47.516 --> 02:16:49.317
More beer.

1964
02:16:49.983 --> 02:16:52.651
Go fast. Oh, here! Here.

1965
02:16:52.684 --> 02:16:56.351
Here. Pay with this.

1966
02:16:56.385 --> 02:16:57.885
Arthur,
this is Atlantean treasure.

1967
02:16:57.919 --> 02:17:00.386
You... You tell them that.

1968
02:17:00.419 --> 02:17:03.353
<i>♪ Got no money
For the sailor suit I... ♪</i>

1969
02:17:03.387 --> 02:17:04.687
- Yep.
<i>- ♪ I'm a sailor... ♪</i>

1970
02:17:04.721 --> 02:17:05.721
You're a sailor.

1971
02:17:06.554 --> 02:17:07.555
He's fine.
