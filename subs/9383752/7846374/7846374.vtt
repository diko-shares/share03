00:00:26.628 --> 00:00:31.265
- All I ask is a tall ship
and a star to sail her by.

2
00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:35.235
All I ask is a tall ship
and a star to sail her by.

3
00:00:36.504 --> 00:00:40.207
All I ask is a tall ship
and a star to sail her by.

4
00:00:41.876 --> 00:00:43.176
Is that enough?

5
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.211
(laughing)

6
00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:45.713
- [Director] Yeah.

7
00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:49.149
'Can I keep this? 'Cause
this is written by Richard.

8
00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:50.083
I can frame this, couldn't I?

9
00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:53.220
- [Director] Yep, that's
how it'll all begin.

10
00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:57.157
- [Leslie Grantham]
Hello Princess.

11
00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:02.162
(wind whooshing)

12
00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:07.835
(tense music)

13
00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:21.516
(wind whooshing)
(tense music)

14
00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:32.125
(tense music)

15
00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:44.806
(wind whooshing)
(tense music)

16
00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:54.716
(tense music)

17
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.428
(phone ringing)

18
00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:15.268
(phone ringing)

19
00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:27.314
- Hello.
- Are you watching the news?

20
00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:30.618
It's happened
again. Another one.

21
00:02:30.652 --> 00:02:31.919
Can you meet?

22
00:02:31.953 --> 00:02:33.286
- [Ingrid] Sure.

23
00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:36.289
Give me an hour.

24
00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:37.357
- Make it 30.

25
00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:53.206
(tense music)

26
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.841
(people chattering)

27
00:02:53.875 --> 00:02:54.709
Peace offering.

28
00:02:55.877 --> 00:02:57.177
- Something like that.

29
00:02:59.514 --> 00:03:01.348
I know what you're
gonna ask me to do.

30
00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:02.817
- Oh. Your job.

31
00:03:03.985 --> 00:03:06.286
You're a reporter, so report.

32
00:03:08.422 --> 00:03:10.858
- Ronnie, I-
- We're in trouble, Ingrid.

33
00:03:12.627 --> 00:03:15.763
The wolves are at
the door, internet.

34
00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:19.366
It's about to finish us
off unless we stay ahead.

35
00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:24.371
I know. We didn't see it coming.

36
00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:25.807
Should have.

37
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.942
Should have,
would've, could have.

38
00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:30.978
- Things are different now.
I've got Eleanor to think about.

39
00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:34.414
- You're the only
one that can do this.

40
00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:36.483
You're the only one with
the inside knowledge.

41
00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:39.352
How long is it?

42
00:03:42.523 --> 00:03:44.357
- 20 Years?
- 20 Years.

43
00:03:47.028 --> 00:03:49.831
Maybe some good can
come of this for you.

44
00:03:50.865 --> 00:03:51.699
Cathartic.

45
00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:56.336
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

46
00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:01.008
- Manipulate me.
Don't bullshit me.

47
00:04:02.877 --> 00:04:04.779
- When you've been this game
as long as I have, Ingrid,

48
00:04:04.812 --> 00:04:06.313
you get to know people.

49
00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.918
We need this exclusive.
I'm not gonna lie.

50
00:04:14.055 --> 00:04:16.456
I wouldn't send you back
in there if I didn't care.

51
00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:18.492
Talk it over with Frank.

52
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.828
- Frank and I aren't-
- Okay then,

53
00:04:22.496 --> 00:04:24.699
talk it over with Eleanor then.

54
00:04:24.732 --> 00:04:26.534
She's the sensible one anyway.

55
00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:27.702
(dramatic music)

56
00:04:27.735 --> 00:04:28.836
Her mother's daughter.

57
00:04:34.976 --> 00:04:37.745
(dramatic music)

58
00:04:44.685 --> 00:04:47.088
- Geography?
- History.

59
00:04:47.121 --> 00:04:47.955
- Good girl.

60
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.631
Hey, what do you think about
going away for a few days?

61
00:04:57.698 --> 00:04:58.533
- Where to?

62
00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:00.835
- [Ingrid] The countryside.

63
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.472
- Like for an actual
holiday or for work again?

64
00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:08.075
- Can it be both?

65
00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:10.678
- That's what you
said last time.

66
00:05:11.846 --> 00:05:13.948
- Well, this time
would be different.

67
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:16.851
You can explore during
the day while I work,

68
00:05:16.884 --> 00:05:18.619
and we can bring the laptop,

69
00:05:18.653 --> 00:05:20.721
watch movies in the
evening by the fire.

70
00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:22.790
- The laptop?

71
00:05:22.824 --> 00:05:24.424
There's no television there?

72
00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:28.095
- No, not there.

73
00:05:29.697 --> 00:05:30.765
Back in time.

74
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.535
- Somewhere you've been before?

75
00:05:39.974 --> 00:05:42.342
- Els, there's something
that I need to tell you.

76
00:05:44.178 --> 00:05:45.012
- What is it?

77
00:05:47.682 --> 00:05:50.117
(tense music)

78
00:05:51.953 --> 00:05:53.521
- Where we are going...

79
00:05:56.023 --> 00:05:57.390
Where we're going is where your

80
00:05:57.424 --> 00:05:59.527
great-grandmother used to live.

81
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.795
- We're going to see Omi?

82
00:06:01.863 --> 00:06:02.495
- No, no.

83
00:06:04.565 --> 00:06:05.967
Omi has not been well for years.

84
00:06:07.635 --> 00:06:10.771
- So then why are we
going? Because she's sick.

85
00:06:12.974 --> 00:06:13.808
- No.

86
00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:19.513
Have you seen anything on the
news about those children?

87
00:06:19.547 --> 00:06:23.084
(dramatic music)

88
00:06:23.117 --> 00:06:25.086
- Well, that happened
near Omi's house.

89
00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:32.593
And when I was younger,
something similar happened.

90
00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:35.363
- Huh?

91
00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:40.400
- My sister

92
00:06:43.604 --> 00:06:44.505
and my mom.

93
00:06:47.041 --> 00:06:49.143
- What is it? What
are you afraid of?

94
00:06:51.078 --> 00:06:52.513
Don't you want to go?

95
00:06:52.546 --> 00:06:54.582
We don't have to go
if you don't want to.

96
00:06:56.483 --> 00:06:57.118
- I'm sorry.

97
00:06:58.753 --> 00:07:01.522
You know I hate doing
this in front of you.

98
00:07:01.555 --> 00:07:03.557
How did you get to
be so wonderful?

99
00:07:04.592 --> 00:07:05.826
My little blonde miracle.

100
00:07:07.061 --> 00:07:09.130
- If you think it'll
help, then we'll go.

101
00:07:10.765 --> 00:07:11.866
- Are you sure?

102
00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:13.567
- Yeah. Just me and you.

103
00:07:15.202 --> 00:07:17.972
- I'll look after
you. I promise.

104
00:07:18.005 --> 00:07:21.075
- And I'll look
after you. I promise.

105
00:07:21.108 --> 00:07:23.844
(wind whooshing)

106
00:07:25.112 --> 00:07:28.582
(upbeat festive music)

107
00:07:35.022 --> 00:07:38.458
(upbeat festive music)

108
00:07:50.037 --> 00:07:53.473
(upbeat festive music)

109
00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:03.617
(upbeat festive music)

110
00:08:11.158 --> 00:08:14.628
(upbeat festive music)

111
00:08:22.603 --> 00:08:25.673
(upbeat festive music)

112
00:08:33.647 --> 00:08:36.917
(upbeat festive music)

113
00:08:44.125 --> 00:08:47.595
(upbeat festive music)

114
00:08:51.866 --> 00:08:55.102
(upbeat festive music)

115
00:09:04.779 --> 00:09:08.049
(upbeat festive music)

116
00:09:16.724 --> 00:09:19.794
(upbeat festive music)

117
00:09:27.368 --> 00:09:30.805
(upbeat festive music)

118
00:09:38.813 --> 00:09:41.816
(people chattering)

119
00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:45.920
- Good evening.
- Hi.

120
00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:49.690
I'm looking for Ronnie Taylor.

121
00:09:49.723 --> 00:09:50.958
- Certainly, sir. Follow me.

122
00:09:52.793 --> 00:09:57.798
(dramatic opera music)
(people chattering)

123
00:10:01.735 --> 00:10:05.806
- [Speaker] And you look like
you've done well for yourself.

124
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.741
- [Speaker] I'm
sorry about Madison.

125
00:10:07.775 --> 00:10:09.844
- [Speaker] Yeah, me too.

126
00:10:09.877 --> 00:10:10.744
- Ingrid. - You've been
looking out for her.

127
00:10:10.778 --> 00:10:12.179
- Hey, it's me.

128
00:10:12.213 --> 00:10:14.782
- Hey. I was hoping you'd call.

129
00:10:16.784 --> 00:10:18.819
I saw the news.

130
00:10:18.853 --> 00:10:20.821
I didn't know if I should...

131
00:10:20.855 --> 00:10:21.789
Is everything okay?

132
00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:23.824
How's Els?

133
00:10:25.326 --> 00:10:26.160
- We're okay.

134
00:10:28.963 --> 00:10:31.398
- Can I talk to her?
Can I say goodnight?

135
00:10:31.432 --> 00:10:34.001
- No, she was tired.
She's gone to bed.

136
00:10:35.236 --> 00:10:37.138
She was doing her-

137
00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:38.339
- History homework.

138
00:10:38.372 --> 00:10:39.907
It's always history
on a Tuesday.

139
00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:44.778
- Listen, we're going
away for a few days.

140
00:10:44.812 --> 00:10:45.412
- Where to?

141
00:10:47.982 --> 00:10:49.250
Ingrid?

142
00:10:49.283 --> 00:10:50.050
- Back there.

143
00:10:51.452 --> 00:10:53.254
- Is this Ronnie
making you do this?

144
00:10:54.755 --> 00:10:56.724
You can't go back there.

145
00:10:56.757 --> 00:11:00.094
Not after what happened. And
I won't let you take Els.

146
00:11:00.127 --> 00:11:02.329
- Frank, I have sole custody.

147
00:11:02.363 --> 00:11:03.731
I don't need your permission.

148
00:11:03.764 --> 00:11:06.000
I'm letting you
know as a courtesy.

149
00:11:06.033 --> 00:11:08.068
- You're letting me
know as a courtesy

150
00:11:08.102 --> 00:11:12.039
that you're taking our daughter
back to where that happened.

151
00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:13.374
- I can't talk to you
when you're like this.

152
00:11:13.407 --> 00:11:15.943
This is exactly why I
needed space, Frank.

153
00:11:15.976 --> 00:11:19.079
- Is everything okay?
Why are you shouting?

154
00:11:19.113 --> 00:11:22.183
- Is that her?
Can I talk to her?

155
00:11:22.216 --> 00:11:23.884
- It's just work.

156
00:11:23.918 --> 00:11:25.920
Go back up and I'll tuck you in.

157
00:11:25.953 --> 00:11:27.955
- Are you sure?
- I'll be right up.

158
00:11:35.029 --> 00:11:39.700
- And you really couldn't
let me say goodnight to her.

159
00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:43.804
I can't talk you
out of this, can I?

160
00:11:45.507 --> 00:11:47.875
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.

161
00:11:48.876 --> 00:11:51.145
- No, I'll call you tomorrow.

162
00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:53.781
We'll be traveling,
I don't know...

163
00:11:53.814 --> 00:11:55.149
- I'll call you tomorrow.

164
00:11:57.451 --> 00:11:58.752
- Good night, Frank.

165
00:12:02.856 --> 00:12:06.026
(dramatic music)

166
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.796
- [Speaker] Things
have changed, Eric.

167
00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:09.430
I'm getting sick to the
back teeth of hearing it.

168
00:12:09.463 --> 00:12:10.297
(indistinct).

169
00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:14.134
(dramatic music)

170
00:12:21.308 --> 00:12:24.044
(dramatic music)

171
00:12:35.155 --> 00:12:37.858
(tense music)

172
00:12:44.398 --> 00:12:46.867
(tense music)

173
00:12:51.905 --> 00:12:54.308
(car whirring)

174
00:12:55.409 --> 00:12:57.911
(tense music)

175
00:13:06.887 --> 00:13:09.390
(tense music)

176
00:13:12.293 --> 00:13:15.062
(car whirring)

177
00:13:19.033 --> 00:13:19.933
- Is this it?

178
00:13:21.035 --> 00:13:22.604
- This is it.

179
00:13:22.637 --> 00:13:24.938
The rest of the way
we take on foot.

180
00:13:27.875 --> 00:13:29.410
- We don't have to
do this, you know.

181
00:13:29.443 --> 00:13:32.346
There was a hotel just up
the road. We can stay there.

182
00:13:33.914 --> 00:13:34.948
- Come on.

183
00:13:36.116 --> 00:13:37.151
It'll be just fine.

184
00:13:44.526 --> 00:13:49.463
(birds chirping)
(dramatic music)

185
00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:58.238
(birds chirping)
(dramatic music)

186
00:14:08.683 --> 00:14:11.452
(dramatic music)

187
00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:25.065
(dramatic music)
(birds chirping)

188
00:14:33.273 --> 00:14:38.278
(dramatic music)
(birds chirping)

189
00:14:40.481 --> 00:14:42.650
- How old is this place?

190
00:14:42.684 --> 00:14:43.518
- Old enough.

191
00:14:49.089 --> 00:14:52.025
(frightening music)

192
00:14:53.561 --> 00:14:55.129
- [Nigel] Gruesome, innit, huh?

193
00:15:07.207 --> 00:15:09.943
- I think it has a
certain charm about it,

194
00:15:09.977 --> 00:15:12.079
which is more than
what I can say for you.

195
00:15:13.748 --> 00:15:16.283
- And you, you must be Eleanor.

196
00:15:17.685 --> 00:15:19.687
Nigel Mortimer, I'm a
good friend of your mum's.

197
00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:23.424
- Are you a reporter too?
- Well, yes I am.

198
00:15:24.626 --> 00:15:26.126
What a lovely young thing.

199
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.496
- What are you doing here
other than trespassing?

200
00:15:29.531 --> 00:15:30.364
- Am I?

201
00:15:31.699 --> 00:15:32.534
Well,

202
00:15:34.134 --> 00:15:36.571
this place has been empty
for a very long time,

203
00:15:38.573 --> 00:15:41.308
but I'm sure you can
fill me in on the detail.

204
00:15:41.341 --> 00:15:42.510
- It's still my
family's property.

205
00:15:42.544 --> 00:15:45.613
- Had trouble off
loading it, have you ?

206
00:15:47.214 --> 00:15:48.616
- What do you want?

207
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:50.284
- Just following a lead,
Ingrid. Same as you go.

208
00:15:50.317 --> 00:15:52.152
- Go follow another one.

209
00:15:54.054 --> 00:15:55.422
Come on Els. Let's go inside.

210
00:15:55.456 --> 00:15:57.525
- Look, look, look
I didn't mean to-

211
00:15:57.559 --> 00:15:59.293
- Don't bullshit her.

212
00:16:01.663 --> 00:16:03.230
- I've got a
proposition for you.

213
00:16:03.263 --> 00:16:04.331
I just want talk
to you about it.

214
00:16:04.364 --> 00:16:05.265
- I'm not interested.

215
00:16:05.299 --> 00:16:06.400
- You haven't even heard it yet.

216
00:16:06.433 --> 00:16:08.235
- She said she's not interested.

217
00:16:09.169 --> 00:16:11.706
- Come on. Let's go
inside and get unpacked.

218
00:16:11.739 --> 00:16:13.641
- Look, look, are you still
on the same phone number?

219
00:16:13.675 --> 00:16:14.542
I'll give you a call later.

220
00:16:14.576 --> 00:16:15.543
- Please don't.

221
00:16:21.616 --> 00:16:23.283
- It's just business, Ingrid.

222
00:16:25.085 --> 00:16:28.188
It's just business.

223
00:16:28.222 --> 00:16:30.592
I heard you could deal with it.

224
00:16:32.092 --> 00:16:33.460
It's just business.

225
00:16:36.664 --> 00:16:39.166
(tense music)

226
00:16:52.145 --> 00:16:55.215
- This is nice.

227
00:16:57.284 --> 00:16:58.686
- No one's been here in a while.

228
00:17:01.656 --> 00:17:02.690
Not since.

229
00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:07.695
(uplifting music)

230
00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:15.302
- I think we need
to go shopping.

231
00:17:15.335 --> 00:17:16.169
- That's okay.

232
00:17:17.539 --> 00:17:19.473
There's somewhere we
need to go anyway.

233
00:17:20.808 --> 00:17:23.645
(uplifting music)

234
00:17:32.587 --> 00:17:35.255
(door clicking)

235
00:17:45.567 --> 00:17:46.768
- So it is true.

236
00:17:48.402 --> 00:17:49.804
You did come back.

237
00:17:51.573 --> 00:17:52.439
- I had to.

238
00:17:57.912 --> 00:17:59.581
- And did you come
back because you heard

239
00:17:59.614 --> 00:18:01.315
about my accident,

240
00:18:02.684 --> 00:18:04.786
or because it was happening
again, because of her.

241
00:18:08.856 --> 00:18:13.260
- You know, sometimes the
longer you leave something,

242
00:18:13.293 --> 00:18:15.262
the harder it gets to come back.

243
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:18.766
But I had to come back, Omi.

244
00:18:21.468 --> 00:18:24.338
- And are you going
to write about it,

245
00:18:24.371 --> 00:18:25.607
or right a wrong?

246
00:18:29.242 --> 00:18:32.179
- I don't think what happened
that night can be fixed.

247
00:18:35.683 --> 00:18:36.517
- Perhaps not.

248
00:18:41.388 --> 00:18:43.691
That night will never leave me.

249
00:18:47.194 --> 00:18:48.295
Once upon a time.

250
00:18:51.431 --> 00:18:53.568
Once upon a time

251
00:18:54.736 --> 00:18:56.871
in a little old
house in the woods

252
00:18:58.238 --> 00:19:00.742
lived a woman called
Ingeborg Hoffman.

253
00:19:02.409 --> 00:19:06.279
It was a cold,
snowy winter's day,

254
00:19:06.313 --> 00:19:10.718
Christmas Eve, and her
family were visiting her.

255
00:19:10.752 --> 00:19:14.187
Her daughter Rosemary,
her son-in-law Lucas

256
00:19:14.221 --> 00:19:18.793
and their daughters,
Hannah and Ingrid.

257
00:19:21.428 --> 00:19:25.165
It was going to be the
perfect Christmas Eve.

258
00:19:26.768 --> 00:19:29.704
While Rosemary and Lucas
were making hot chocolate

259
00:19:29.737 --> 00:19:33.541
in the kitchen, Ingeborg
sat with her beloved

260
00:19:33.574 --> 00:19:35.442
granddaughters by the fire.

261
00:19:37.377 --> 00:19:40.280
"Omi, Omi,

262
00:19:41.314 --> 00:19:43.751
please tell us a story.

263
00:19:43.785 --> 00:19:45.753
And can we have a scary one?"

264
00:19:48.956 --> 00:19:50.858
So I said, "All
right, just the one.

265
00:19:50.892 --> 00:19:52.760
And then it's bedtime."

266
00:19:55.697 --> 00:20:00.668
And I told you the story,
the curse of Frau Perchta.

267
00:20:03.403 --> 00:20:06.339
The most feared and
terrifying witch of the area.

268
00:20:07.508 --> 00:20:10.277
How she would capture
badly behaved children,

269
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:11.946
lip their stomachs
open and fill them

270
00:20:11.979 --> 00:20:13.715
with pebbles and straw.

271
00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:19.352
And you said to me, how do
I know so much about her?

272
00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:24.257
And I whispered,
"Because I too survived

273
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.562
as a little girl in Germany."

274
00:20:28.763 --> 00:20:30.363
- I couldn't sleep that night.

275
00:20:32.466 --> 00:20:34.334
That story terrified me.

276
00:20:37.705 --> 00:20:41.341
I left Hannah and
went downstairs to
get a glass of milk.

277
00:20:43.878 --> 00:20:45.412
And that's when I heard it.

278
00:20:48.482 --> 00:20:49.584
- Hannah didn't believe.

279
00:20:50.618 --> 00:20:51.519
And you did.

280
00:20:52.553 --> 00:20:54.655
That is why she went for her.

281
00:20:56.524 --> 00:20:58.626
I remember your parents
running up the stairs,

282
00:20:58.659 --> 00:20:59.927
but it was too late.

283
00:21:01.394 --> 00:21:04.297
And your mother started
to stop her from leaving,

284
00:21:05.099 --> 00:21:06.466
and she killed her too.

285
00:21:08.636 --> 00:21:10.437
As your father sat,

286
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:14.642
cradling her in his arms
during her final breaths,

287
00:21:15.977 --> 00:21:20.915
you and I ran into the
forest, into the night.

288
00:21:23.518 --> 00:21:26.754
But you have forgotten
my parting words to you.

289
00:21:28.523 --> 00:21:29.690
- No, I remember.

290
00:21:32.492 --> 00:21:33.293
- Run.

291
00:21:34.327 --> 00:21:38.498
Run and never stop running
and don't come back.

292
00:21:44.404 --> 00:21:45.506
- Three children are dead.

293
00:21:46.908 --> 00:21:49.544
(tense music)

294
00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.721
- Please tell me you
didn't bring her.

295
00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:04.992
- It was the only thing
left in the snack machine.

296
00:22:05.026 --> 00:22:06.828
(Omi speaking foreign language)

297
00:22:06.861 --> 00:22:10.731
- Omi, this is Eleanor.
Your great-granddaughter.

298
00:22:12.499 --> 00:22:13.634
- You stupid, stupid child.

299
00:22:15.169 --> 00:22:16.704
- Is everything okay?

300
00:22:16.737 --> 00:22:19.040
- Hey everything's okay, honey.

301
00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:20.808
You go to the car, okay?

302
00:22:20.842 --> 00:22:22.043
- Are you sure?

303
00:22:22.076 --> 00:22:23.578
- Do as your mother
says. Go, get out.

304
00:22:23.611 --> 00:22:24.444
- Omi!

305
00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.748
- And you too.

306
00:22:27.782 --> 00:22:29.416
Go.

307
00:22:29.449 --> 00:22:32.452
Go! And never come back!

308
00:22:32.485 --> 00:22:34.789
(tense music)

309
00:22:42.763 --> 00:22:46.067
(tense music continues)

310
00:22:53.574 --> 00:22:56.711
(tense music continues)

311
00:23:07.755 --> 00:23:11.092
(tense music continues)

312
00:23:18.766 --> 00:23:22.103
(tense music continues)

313
00:23:29.911 --> 00:23:33.446
(tense music continues)

314
00:23:40.821 --> 00:23:44.158
(tense music continues)

315
00:23:52.133 --> 00:23:54.869
(birds chirping)

316
00:24:07.882 --> 00:24:09.116
- Are you okay?

317
00:24:11.986 --> 00:24:14.021
- Yeah. Sorry baby.

318
00:24:15.856 --> 00:24:16.824
- Where did you go?

319
00:24:21.095 --> 00:24:22.697
- I was just thinking about Omi.

320
00:24:23.998 --> 00:24:27.668
I'm sorry you had to see
that. She isn't well.

321
00:24:27.702 --> 00:24:28.736
- It's okay.

322
00:24:31.839 --> 00:24:34.108
- It's not though, is it?

323
00:24:34.141 --> 00:24:35.576
None of this is okay.

324
00:24:36.911 --> 00:24:38.713
I shouldn't have
brought us here.

325
00:24:43.684 --> 00:24:45.987
- I said I didn't mind
coming. And I meant it.

326
00:24:50.224 --> 00:24:52.693
(birds chirping)

327
00:24:52.727 --> 00:24:54.762
- How'd you get so good at that?

328
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:57.798
- We're survivors, aren't we?

329
00:24:59.033 --> 00:24:59.867
- We are.

330
00:25:04.772 --> 00:25:08.009
- It's okay if you
wanna talk about it.

331
00:25:17.051 --> 00:25:17.885
Mom?

332
00:25:19.954 --> 00:25:21.055
- When I was your age,

333
00:25:24.658 --> 00:25:28.929
my sister Hannah, who was
three years younger than me...

334
00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.102
We would come here
every Christmas.

335
00:25:37.104 --> 00:25:40.174
Every Christmas, without fail
with mom and dad to see Omi.

336
00:25:44.078 --> 00:25:45.146
Always the same.

337
00:25:47.081 --> 00:25:51.719
Around that fire,
the same record on.

338
00:25:53.754 --> 00:25:55.790
The same sweets and chocolates.

339
00:25:57.892 --> 00:25:59.193
The same smells.

340
00:26:00.661 --> 00:26:03.197
(dramatic music)

341
00:26:05.966 --> 00:26:10.971
Sometimes I think, what if we
didn't ask to hear a story?

342
00:26:13.674 --> 00:26:14.875
Would she have heard us?

343
00:26:17.378 --> 00:26:19.180
Would she have heard
Omi that night?

344
00:26:20.881 --> 00:26:21.882
- Frau Perchta?

345
00:26:25.986 --> 00:26:26.821
- Yeah.

346
00:26:28.255 --> 00:26:30.791
But she cursed this family
long before that night.

347
00:26:34.395 --> 00:26:36.831
That's why Omi knew
so much about her.

348
00:26:38.999 --> 00:26:41.001
She survived her as a child.

349
00:26:44.205 --> 00:26:46.040
Ask her where she
got those scars,

350
00:26:47.875 --> 00:26:49.810
and she'll never
tell another soul.

351
00:26:52.046 --> 00:26:53.247
Not after that night.

352
00:26:57.685 --> 00:26:58.352
Perchta told her,

353
00:26:59.753 --> 00:27:02.389
"Your scars have the
power to remind you

354
00:27:02.423 --> 00:27:03.757
that the past is real.

355
00:27:06.093 --> 00:27:08.362
Never forget who gave
you the greatest."

356
00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:13.801
And she never did.

357
00:27:21.175 --> 00:27:22.776
That night Omi told me,

358
00:27:24.812 --> 00:27:28.182
in the woods, to never return.

359
00:27:30.384 --> 00:27:32.286
I lost my entire
family that night.

360
00:27:35.723 --> 00:27:36.924
Everyone I ever loved.

361
00:27:40.261 --> 00:27:41.128
- Not everyone.

362
00:27:47.768 --> 00:27:48.903
- Love you.

363
00:27:48.936 --> 00:27:49.737
- Love you too.

364
00:27:51.805 --> 00:27:54.842
- Are you hungry?
- Always.

365
00:27:55.943 --> 00:27:57.011
- What do you fancy?

366
00:27:58.946 --> 00:28:00.915
- Pasta.
- Obviously.

367
00:28:01.815 --> 00:28:03.184

- I wanted a glass of milk,
but I dropped the glass.

440
00:35:14.716 --> 00:35:16.216
- Don't worry.

441
00:35:16.249 --> 00:35:18.418
Mind the glass,
I'll clean it up.

442
00:35:21.789 --> 00:35:24.792

- Claire?

450
00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.790
Claire Chandler, is that you?
- You know it fucking is.

451
00:36:28.823 --> 00:36:30.792
What the fuck are
you doing back here?

452
00:36:30.825 --> 00:36:32.359
- What?

453
00:36:32.392 --> 00:36:33.393
I came because-

454
00:36:33.427 --> 00:36:34.361
- Your family?

455
00:36:34.394 --> 00:36:36.329
Haven't you done enough damage?

456
00:36:36.363 --> 00:36:39.466
How many more, Ingrid? How
many more people have to die?

457
00:36:39.499 --> 00:36:41.435
I bet she's still
alive, isn't she?

458
00:36:42.369 --> 00:36:44.005
I hope she rots!

459
00:36:44.038 --> 00:36:46.406
Why are you back here in
this house of all places?

460
00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.575
- Keep your voice down.

461
00:36:47.608 --> 00:36:49.276
My child is asleep upstairs.

462
00:36:49.309 --> 00:36:50.678
- Well, lucky fucking you.

463
00:36:53.614 --> 00:36:54.448
- Oh God.

464
00:36:56.483 --> 00:36:57.350
It was your son.

465
00:36:59.053 --> 00:36:59.887
- My son.

466
00:37:00.955 --> 00:37:02.724
His blood is on your hands.

467
00:37:04.058 --> 00:37:05.258
- Claire, please.

468
00:37:06.293 --> 00:37:09.362
Why don't you come inside?
We can sit and talk.

469
00:37:09.396 --> 00:37:10.832
You're upset.

470
00:37:10.865 --> 00:37:13.300
- Sit and talk for one of your
stories? I don't think so.

471
00:37:14.468 --> 00:37:16.604
Nobody wants you here.
We don't want you here.

472
00:37:16.637 --> 00:37:19.406
That's what I'm
here to say. Leave.

473
00:37:19.439 --> 00:37:22.610
Leave this town, leave my
family and leave my daughter.

474
00:37:25.847 --> 00:37:28.549
She's all we've got left.
You leave me with something.

475
00:37:33.487 --> 00:37:34.488
- Who was that?

476
00:37:39.359 --> 00:37:44.364
(tense music)
(birds chirping)

477

480
00:38:21.669 --> 00:38:26.040
- I really do not appreciate
you coming here like this.

481
00:38:26.073 --> 00:38:27.407
It is not graceful.

482
00:38:29.544 --> 00:38:32.947
But then I never had you down
as a man of much decorum.

483
00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:35.016
- Look, I'm just trying to help.

484
00:38:36.383 --> 00:38:38.052
Your family has suffered
enough over the years

485
00:38:38.085 --> 00:38:40.387
because of this story.

486
00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:41.956
- Story?

487
00:38:41.989 --> 00:38:44.525
You think this is a story?

488
00:38:44.559 --> 00:38:46.794
- Well, that's what
it is. Isn't it?

489
00:38:48.395 --> 00:38:52.767
- The legend of Frau Perchta
is as real as you and me

490
00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.501
sat here right now.

491
00:38:54.535 --> 00:38:57.572
I can assure you.
(Nigel laughs)

492
00:38:57.605 --> 00:39:01.008
- So are you trying to
tell me that she's here

493
00:39:01.042 --> 00:39:04.411
in the room with us now?

494
00:39:04.444 --> 00:39:06.647
- Come on.
- You would do well

495
00:39:06.681 --> 00:39:09.684
not to mock, Mr. Mortimer.

496
00:39:11.552 --> 00:39:13.154
She will not take kindly to it.

497
00:39:13.187 --> 00:39:15.890
- Well, I no longer a child.

498
00:39:15.923 --> 00:39:19.560
I'm a grown up, and I
don't scare so easily.

499
00:39:20.528 --> 00:39:22.697
- And if you think she
only takes children,

500
00:39:23.998 --> 00:39:26.567
you are making a grave error.

501
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:30.571
(tense music)

502
00:39:36.811 --> 00:39:39.513
(tense music)

503
00:39:41.015 --> 00:39:42.583
- Hello.

504
00:39:42.617 --> 00:39:44.451
Hi, is this Mrs. Ward?

505
00:39:44.484 --> 00:39:47.088
Hi, can you put me through
to the morgue please?

506
00:39:47.121 --> 00:39:48.522
I'll hold.

507
00:39:48.556 --> 00:39:50.490
Oh, Paul. Hi Paul.

508
00:39:50.524 --> 00:39:53.160
My name is Ingrid,
Ingrid Hoffman.

509
00:39:54.528 --> 00:39:56.463
Would it be okay to
ask you some questions

510
00:39:56.496 --> 00:39:57.698
on your friend, Ben.

511
00:39:57.732 --> 00:39:59.200
Ben Chandler.

512
00:39:59.233 --> 00:40:00.935
I was wondering if I
could get some information

513
00:40:00.968 --> 00:40:06.741
on case number YXTZ-12?

514
00:40:07.808 --> 00:40:09.476
And has he been into the office

515
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:11.478
since that note was
left on his desk?

516
00:40:11.512 --> 00:40:14.148
Please let me know if
anything upsets you.

517
00:40:14.181 --> 00:40:17.585
I was wondering, when was the
last time that you saw Ben?

518
00:40:17.618 --> 00:40:19.520
I was wondering if you
could gimme some information

519
00:40:19.553 --> 00:40:20.855
on the cause of death?

520
00:40:20.888 --> 00:40:22.590
Oh, hi, is that Mrs. Ward?

521
00:40:22.623 --> 00:40:24.992
Did you see anyone
suspicious in the area?

522
00:40:25.026 --> 00:40:27.828
Did you see any, I don't
know, anything suspicious?

523
00:40:27.862 --> 00:40:29.931
Anything that looked
out of the ordinary?

524
00:40:29.964 --> 00:40:32.934
Well, I am the media and I
don't have enough information.

525
00:40:32.967 --> 00:40:34.602
I'm a journalist.

526
00:40:34.635 --> 00:40:37.138
I'm writing about the recent
death of Ben Chandler.

527
00:40:37.171 --> 00:40:38.506
Is there any information
that's not classified

528
00:40:38.539 --> 00:40:40.641
in relation to the case?

529
00:40:40.675 --> 00:40:42.076
I'm just trying
to obviously help

530
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:44.745
and find out who's responsible.

531
00:40:44.779 --> 00:40:46.681
I believe he was your neighbour.

532
00:40:46.714 --> 00:40:50.584
Could you tell me a
bit more about... a bit
more about him?

533
00:40:50.618 --> 00:40:52.586
Could you tell me the last
time that you saw him?

534
00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:53.788
Okay, all right. Thank
you for your time.

535
00:40:53.821 --> 00:40:54.655
Useless.

536
00:40:57.258 --> 00:41:00.161
(plate screeching)

537
00:41:04.632 --> 00:41:07.068
- Hey.
- Did you have a good day?

538
00:41:07.101 --> 00:41:08.235
What did you get up to?

539
00:41:08.269 --> 00:41:09.670
- I went for a
walk in the forest.

540
00:41:09.704 --> 00:41:11.672
- I hope you didn't go too far.

541
00:41:11.706 --> 00:41:14.075
Always make sure you
can see the house.

542
00:41:14.108 --> 00:41:15.609
- I made a friend.

543
00:41:15.643 --> 00:41:17.745
- Okay, great. Who?

544
00:41:17.778 --> 00:41:19.580
- She said her name was Natalie.

545
00:41:20.681 --> 00:41:22.717
- Okay, cool.

546
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:23.918
- She's all right, I guess.

547
00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:30.558
- Where'd you meet? She
was just in the woods.

548
00:41:30.591 --> 00:41:31.692
- I think she was on a walk,

549
00:41:31.726 --> 00:41:33.094
but she's gonna come by tomorrow

550
00:41:33.127 --> 00:41:35.129
and we're gonna
explore together.

551
00:41:35.162 --> 00:41:37.031
- Well, tell her to
come in and say hi.

552
00:41:37.064 --> 00:41:37.865
- Okay.

553
00:41:41.335 --> 00:41:44.038
(birds chirping)

554
00:41:46.607 --> 00:41:49.143
(wind whooshing)

555
00:41:56.684 --> 00:41:57.718
- So where are you guys from?

556
00:41:57.752 --> 00:41:58.819
- We're from West London.

557
00:41:59.887 --> 00:42:02.189
- Is this like
completely different?

558
00:42:02.223 --> 00:42:05.559
- It's a lot more
peaceful. And it's quieter.

559
00:42:06.727 --> 00:42:07.762
- How long will
you guys be here?

560
00:42:09.063 --> 00:42:11.999
- I'm not sure. My mom
was working on a story.

561
00:42:12.033 --> 00:42:13.634
- She's a writer, right?

562
00:42:13.667 --> 00:42:15.636
- A journalist.
- So cool.

563
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:17.104
What's it about?

564
00:42:18.272 --> 00:42:19.740
- Not sure if I'm
supposed to say.

565
00:42:22.343 --> 00:42:24.779
- Is it about what
happened here?

566
00:42:26.047 --> 00:42:27.248
- What do you mean?

567
00:42:28.382 --> 00:42:30.618
- Everyone in the village
knows what happened here.

568
00:42:31.786 --> 00:42:33.621
Must get quite creepy at night.

569
00:42:33.654 --> 00:42:35.056
I wouldn't wanna sleep here.

570
00:42:37.825 --> 00:42:39.760
Do you wanna see
where it happened?

571
00:42:44.732 --> 00:42:49.670
(birds chirping)
(tense music)

572
00:43:00.114 --> 00:43:02.683
(tense music)

573
00:43:11.725 --> 00:43:14.195
Do you have any
brothers or sisters?

574
00:43:14.228 --> 00:43:15.830
- No. Do you?

575
00:43:15.863 --> 00:43:17.398
I had a brother.

576
00:43:17.431 --> 00:43:19.700
- Had?
- He died.

577
00:43:19.733 --> 00:43:21.735
- Oh my God. I'm so sorry.

578
00:43:21.769 --> 00:43:23.671
- Why? It's not
your fault, is it?

579
00:43:23.704 --> 00:43:24.972
- What?
- It's not your fault

580
00:43:25.005 --> 00:43:26.807
my brother died, is it?

581
00:43:26.841 --> 00:43:28.275
You, your family?

582
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:29.677
- I'm not sure what you mean.

583
00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:30.711
- Don't play dumb.

584
00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.315
The three kids that died here,

585
00:43:34.348 --> 00:43:36.217
the ones your mom
is writing about.

586
00:43:37.852 --> 00:43:40.654
One of them was my brother.
And you know how he died?

587
00:43:40.688 --> 00:43:41.889
It was her.

588
00:43:41.922 --> 00:43:44.758
It was Frau Perchta trying to
bring her back to the village.

589
00:43:45.993 --> 00:43:48.829
I know your mom is the
girl from the story.

590
00:43:48.863 --> 00:43:49.730
The one that got away.

591
00:43:49.763 --> 00:43:50.397
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

592
00:43:50.431 --> 00:43:52.333
- So don't play fucking dumb.

593
00:43:52.366 --> 00:43:54.135
My brother said
because your mom-

594
00:43:54.168 --> 00:43:56.770
- That's not true.
- Family cursed this village.

595
00:43:56.804 --> 00:43:58.239
Now she's going come for you.

596
00:43:58.272 --> 00:44:01.842
(ominous voice whispering)

597
00:44:05.179 --> 00:44:07.448
You can run but you can't hide!

598
00:44:07.481 --> 00:44:11.252
Not from her. Not
from Frau Perchta.

599
00:44:11.285 --> 00:44:12.786
(tense music)

600
00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:15.189
(ominous voice whispering)

601
00:44:15.222 --> 00:44:16.056
No.

602
00:44:16.891 --> 00:44:18.759
Please don't hurt me.

603
00:44:18.792 --> 00:44:20.961
I brought her here
for. I did it for you.

604
00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:25.733
(frightening music)
(Natalie screaming)

605
00:44:25.766 --> 00:44:28.269
(tense music)

606
00:44:34.041 --> 00:44:36.810
(door banging)

607
00:44:37.912 --> 00:44:39.213
- What is it?

608
00:44:39.246 --> 00:44:41.849
Els, what on earth's happened?

609
00:44:43.951 --> 00:44:44.785
Where?

610
00:44:47.922 --> 00:44:48.956
Stay here.

611
00:44:48.989 --> 00:44:50.191
- No, don't leave me!

612
00:44:50.224 --> 00:44:52.893
- I'm coming right
back. I promise.

613
00:44:53.894 --> 00:44:56.397
I'll be right back. Okay?

614
00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:59.767
I'll be back. I'm
coming right back.

615
00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:00.434
- Okay.

616
00:45:01.969 --> 00:45:04.471
(tense music)

617
00:45:12.846 --> 00:45:15.149
(tense music)

618
00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:25.392
(tense music)

619
00:45:30.931 --> 00:45:33.234
(tense music)

620
00:45:45.012 --> 00:45:47.781
(birds chirping)

621
00:45:52.486 --> 00:45:57.491
(tense music)
(birds chirping)

622
00:46:03.897 --> 00:46:06.400
(tense music)

623
00:46:07.401 --> 00:46:08.769
- Is that you?

624
00:46:17.978 --> 00:46:19.780
It's been a long time!

625
00:46:21.348 --> 00:46:24.351
(frightening music)

626
00:46:25.886 --> 00:46:28.889
(frightening music)

627
00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:42.504
(frightening music)

628
00:47:00.954 --> 00:47:02.590
- How are you holding up?

629
00:47:17.438 --> 00:47:20.040
The family has been informed.

630
00:47:21.543 --> 00:47:22.476
Tragic.

631
00:47:23.645 --> 00:47:26.347
Only last week her brother.

632
00:47:29.116 --> 00:47:31.185
All these years, without
anything like this.

633
00:47:32.687 --> 00:47:33.555
Not since your...

634
00:47:37.625 --> 00:47:42.630
And then you return
and so do the killings.

635
00:47:45.165 --> 00:47:47.034
- I returned because
of the killings.

636
00:47:47.067 --> 00:47:50.871
- And how exactly do you
plan to explain this?

637
00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.643
The young girl, Natalie.

638
00:47:57.512 --> 00:47:58.979
- What do you want me to say?

639
00:48:02.149 --> 00:48:05.319
- Well, whatever it is,

640
00:48:05.352 --> 00:48:08.088
I'll need you to come to the
station tomorrow morning,

641
00:48:08.122 --> 00:48:09.390
give a formal statement.

642
00:48:15.162 --> 00:48:16.196
Aren't you brave?

643
00:48:18.465 --> 00:48:21.402
Coming back here
after what happened.

644
00:48:24.438 --> 00:48:25.640
- It's just a house.

645
00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.042
- Oh, it's way more
than that, isn't it?

646
00:48:31.111 --> 00:48:33.046
This is a very old house,

647
00:48:35.082 --> 00:48:38.152
and old houses tend to
have a lot of secrets.

648
00:48:46.093 --> 00:48:48.696
I'm gonna recommend
you take your kid.

649
00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:50.197
- Eleanor.

650
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:55.235
- Eleanor.
- Eleanor.

651
00:48:57.037 --> 00:48:58.071
- Eleanor,

652
00:49:01.743 --> 00:49:05.379
and go stay at the hotel
in the village tonight.

653
00:49:05.412 --> 00:49:08.015
It's not appropriate
for her to be here.

654
00:49:08.048 --> 00:49:09.983
Get away from it for the night.

655
00:49:11.519 --> 00:49:14.354
Will do you some
good, clear your head.

656
00:49:14.388 --> 00:49:16.023
And then you can stop by
the station on your way

657
00:49:16.056 --> 00:49:17.391
to pick up your things.

658
00:49:17.424 --> 00:49:19.059
- Pick up my things?

659
00:49:19.092 --> 00:49:23.263
- Folks around here are
sensitive with your family name.

660
00:49:23.297 --> 00:49:24.164
What's going on.

661
00:49:27.501 --> 00:49:28.703
- What are you saying?

662
00:49:30.337 --> 00:49:32.239
Are you threatening
me, detective?

663
00:49:35.275 --> 00:49:37.545
- Do you hear me
threatening you?

664
00:49:41.381 --> 00:49:42.550
- I'm a journalist.

665
00:49:43.718 --> 00:49:45.252
It's my job to read
between the lines.

666
00:49:45.285 --> 00:49:49.323
- There is nothing for
you here, Ms. Hoffman.

667
00:49:54.194 --> 00:49:55.663
I'll see you in the morning.

668
00:49:55.697 --> 00:49:58.566
I'm sure we'll be able to get
things wrapped up promptly.

669
00:49:58.600 --> 00:49:59.667
Get you on your way.

670
00:50:01.235 --> 00:50:03.270
These woods are no
place for a child.

671
00:50:08.075 --> 00:50:13.080
(tense music)
(birds chirping)

672
00:50:20.755 --> 00:50:23.290
They should have let it burn.

673
00:50:27.294 --> 00:50:32.266
(tense music)
(wind whooshing)

674
00:50:39.641 --> 00:50:42.309
(tense music)

675
00:50:49.483 --> 00:50:52.152
(tense music)

676
00:50:58.526 --> 00:51:01.228
(tense music)

677
00:51:11.506 --> 00:51:14.207
(tense music)

678
00:51:25.452 --> 00:51:28.155
(tense music)

679
00:51:40.233 --> 00:51:42.704
(tense music)

680
00:51:52.212 --> 00:51:54.515
(tense music)

681
00:52:03.825 --> 00:52:06.326
(tense music)

682
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:15.302
(tense music)

683
00:52:22.275 --> 00:52:25.245
(birds chirping)

684
00:52:33.788 --> 00:52:36.524
(dramatic music)

685
00:52:44.599 --> 00:52:47.334
(dramatic music)

686
00:52:58.278 --> 00:53:01.248
(dramatic music)

687
00:53:09.791 --> 00:53:14.796
(dramatic music)
(birds chirping)

688
00:53:23.336 --> 00:53:25.873
(dramatic music)

689
00:53:33.346 --> 00:53:36.316
(birds chirping)

690
00:54:00.474 --> 00:54:03.243
(birds chirping)

691
00:54:10.383 --> 00:54:12.687
(tense music)

692
00:54:20.528 --> 00:54:23.030
(tense music)

693
00:54:29.003 --> 00:54:34.008
(birds chirping)
(tense music)

694
00:54:42.683 --> 00:54:45.385
(tense music)

695
00:54:54.361 --> 00:54:56.998
(water splashing)

696
00:55:04.605 --> 00:55:09.610
(birds chirping)
(tense music)

697
00:55:18.485 --> 00:55:20.988
(tense music)

698
00:55:27.595 --> 00:55:30.598
(frightening music)

699
00:55:40.541 --> 00:55:43.544
(frightening music)

700
00:55:51.451 --> 00:55:53.054
(ominous voice whispering)

701
00:55:53.087 --> 00:55:56.090
(ominous screaming)

702
00:56:08.936 --> 00:56:12.039
- Els, why don't you go play
in the orchard for a bit?

703
00:56:12.073 --> 00:56:15.475
Don't go any further.
Make sure I can see you.

704
00:56:16.577 --> 00:56:19.146
- Are you sure you'll be okay?

705
00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:20.514
- We'll be okay.

706
00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:24.585
- Go on. It'll be fine.

707
00:56:27.121 --> 00:56:29.857
(dramatic music)

708
00:56:41.501 --> 00:56:44.471
(dramatic music)

709
00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:55.149
(dramatic music)

710
00:57:02.723 --> 00:57:05.693
(dramatic music)

711
00:57:17.204 --> 00:57:19.941
(dramatic music)

712
00:57:27.548 --> 00:57:28.549
- I'm so sorry.

713
00:57:30.217 --> 00:57:32.787
I can't begin to imagine
what you're going through.

714
00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:37.525
- But you can, can't you.

715
00:57:40.795 --> 00:57:44.131
She took them from
you too. Your family.

716
00:57:44.966 --> 00:57:46.466
- But not my children.

717
00:57:48.769 --> 00:57:50.871
No parent should ever
have to bury a child.

718
00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:01.949
(branch clicking)

719
00:58:01.983 --> 00:58:02.950
- Is someone there?

720
00:58:07.154 --> 00:58:09.557
You're not supposed to be
here. How did you find us?

721
00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:12.026
- I just wanted to
see you. I'm worried.

722
00:58:13.227 --> 00:58:15.696
Your mum. She's not
answering the phone.

723
00:58:15.730 --> 00:58:17.932
Is she all right? Are you okay?

724
00:58:17.965 --> 00:58:18.866
- What'd you want?

725
00:58:19.967 --> 00:58:21.969
- She told you, didn't she?

726
00:58:22.003 --> 00:58:23.704
She told you what
happened here to her.

727
00:58:25.206 --> 00:58:27.041
Did you go and see her?

728
00:58:27.074 --> 00:58:28.542
Did you go and see Omi?

729
00:58:28.576 --> 00:58:29.276
- She's sick.
- Yeah, well,

730
00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:30.644
she's been sick for a long time.

731
00:58:30.678 --> 00:58:32.546
- No, she's really sick.

732
00:58:34.081 --> 00:58:36.684
- Look Els. You have
to make her see sense.

733
00:58:37.351 --> 00:58:39.687
We've got to get out of here.

734
00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:41.789
All of us, together.

735
00:58:44.158 --> 00:58:47.161
Look, I'm sorry. I'm
not trying to upset you.

736
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:51.298
But if she told you
what happened here,
are you not scared?

737
00:58:52.666 --> 00:58:55.236
No. Of course you're not.

738
00:58:56.737 --> 00:58:59.540
But I mean it, Els,
if any of it's true,

739
00:59:00.875 --> 00:59:02.143
you're both in danger.

740
00:59:04.712 --> 00:59:09.717
Els, look it's me. Come on.

741
00:59:10.785 --> 00:59:12.119
Els. Did something happen?

742
00:59:14.255 --> 00:59:15.823
What happened?
- I can't talk about it.

743
00:59:15.856 --> 00:59:19.060
- Why can't you talk about it?

744
00:59:19.093 --> 00:59:21.762
- I never really
believed it back then.

745
00:59:23.798 --> 00:59:25.833
We all thought your
grandmother was mad,

746
00:59:25.866 --> 00:59:27.802
and it must run in the family.

747
00:59:30.738 --> 00:59:31.972
We used to joke about it.

748
00:59:34.141 --> 00:59:35.242
Me and the other kids.

749
00:59:38.646 --> 00:59:40.247
But no one's laughing
now, are they?

750
00:59:44.652 --> 00:59:45.319
I believe you.

751
00:59:48.355 --> 00:59:50.091
How can we stop her?

752
00:59:50.124 --> 00:59:51.926
- Many have tried, I'm sure.

753
00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:56.730
She's existed for
centuries. Millennia.

754
00:59:56.764 --> 00:59:57.998
- But why here?

755
00:59:58.032 --> 01:00:00.201
Why your family, this village?

756
01:00:02.002 --> 01:00:03.170
- She followed Omi.

757
01:00:06.807 --> 01:00:08.742
- I'm really sorry
for what I said.

758
01:00:09.844 --> 01:00:11.345
I didn't mean it about Omi.

759
01:00:13.347 --> 01:00:15.149
God, I hope she didn't hear it.

760
01:00:15.182 --> 01:00:16.217
Your daughter.

761
01:00:17.218 --> 01:00:18.619
- I should check on her.

762
01:00:21.021 --> 01:00:22.356
Jesus Christ.

763
01:00:24.792 --> 01:00:27.728
- It's true. It's all true,
and it's happening again?

764
01:00:27.761 --> 01:00:30.798
- I need to go. She told
me not to talk about it.

765
01:00:30.831 --> 01:00:33.100
- To talk about what?

766
01:00:33.134 --> 01:00:34.702
Eleanor! Eleanor!

767
01:00:35.803 --> 01:00:36.804
Eleanor!

768
01:00:37.872 --> 01:00:38.873
Eleanor!

769
01:00:49.783 --> 01:00:51.152
- I told you to stay away.

770
01:00:51.185 --> 01:00:52.786
- I was worried.

771
01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:55.456
- What about, Frank? I looked
after myself before you.

772
01:00:55.489 --> 01:00:57.758
I can look after
myself after you.

773
01:00:57.791 --> 01:01:00.027
I can look after both
of us, me and Eleanor.

774
01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:01.262
What the hell is your problem?

775
01:01:01.295 --> 01:01:03.831
- You're my fucking
problem. You and her.

776
01:01:04.899 --> 01:01:06.367
- You said we can move past it.

777
01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.868
- Yeah, well, I
guess that was just

778
01:01:07.902 --> 01:01:09.270
another thing I was wrong about.

779
01:01:09.303 --> 01:01:10.871
- This house is not
safe for you or Eleanor,

780
01:01:10.905 --> 01:01:13.941
and you know it, and that's
why you weren't here.

781
01:01:13.974 --> 01:01:15.176
- Jesus Christ.

782
01:01:15.209 --> 01:01:16.310
How long have you been
following me this time?

783
01:01:16.343 --> 01:01:17.811
- Look, we can leave now.

784
01:01:17.845 --> 01:01:19.914
We can get in the
car and we can go.

785
01:01:19.947 --> 01:01:21.115
- I have to stay.

786
01:01:21.148 --> 01:01:22.683
We have to finish this.

787
01:01:24.818 --> 01:01:26.420
- It's finished. It's over.

788
01:01:26.453 --> 01:01:28.789
Goodnight Vienna.
They're all dead, Ingrid.

789
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:31.859
Your sister, your
mum and your dad.

790
01:01:31.892 --> 01:01:32.927
They're all fucking dead!

791
01:01:34.495 --> 01:01:35.329
- Goodbye, Frank.

792
01:01:40.134 --> 01:01:43.037
(hospital machines beeping)

793
01:01:47.341 --> 01:01:49.443
- I wondered if you might come.

794
01:01:49.476 --> 01:01:50.444
- It needs to end.

795
01:01:51.812 --> 01:01:52.947
I need to know how
to break the curse.

796
01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:54.915
- The curse of Frau Perchta.

797
01:01:56.083 --> 01:01:58.919
And here was I thinking
you were the wicked one.

798
01:02:00.487 --> 01:02:01.422
- I love them both.

799
01:02:02.823 --> 01:02:05.226
Please. You must know.

800
01:02:06.327 --> 01:02:08.162
- You think because I survived?

801
01:02:09.296 --> 01:02:12.199
No one survives Frau
Perchta, not in the end.

802
01:02:13.167 --> 01:02:15.803
This is not a fairy tale.

803
01:02:15.836 --> 01:02:17.838
There is no happy ever after.

804
01:02:17.871 --> 01:02:20.941
You cannot come riding in
here on your white stallion.

805
01:02:20.975 --> 01:02:22.376
- I want to save my family.

806
01:02:22.409 --> 01:02:24.979
- Oh. How noble.

807
01:02:26.413 --> 01:02:28.916
Pity you didn't think of
that 18 months ago when...

808
01:02:30.818 --> 01:02:31.452
- For Eleanor.

809
01:02:32.554 --> 01:02:33.387
Please, Omi.

810
01:02:36.524 --> 01:02:37.358
What is it?

811
01:02:39.994 --> 01:02:42.863
(thunder creaking)

812
01:02:55.610 --> 01:02:58.345
(wind whooshing)

813
01:03:00.314 --> 01:03:03.050
(door knocking)

814
01:03:07.054 --> 01:03:08.355
- What are you doing here?

815
01:03:11.125 --> 01:03:13.528
- Look, I know you hate me

816
01:03:14.461 --> 01:03:15.429
and I hate myself.

817
01:03:17.298 --> 01:03:18.966
I've let you and Eleanor down

818
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.035
and betrayed you.

819
01:03:22.570 --> 01:03:24.805
My best friend.

820
01:03:26.273 --> 01:03:27.808
- You've got two minutes.

821
01:03:32.212 --> 01:03:34.948
(rain trickling)

822
01:03:37.918 --> 01:03:38.553
Well?

823
01:03:40.087 --> 01:03:40.921
- I love you.

824
01:03:42.423 --> 01:03:43.357
And I love Eleanor.

825
01:03:45.959 --> 01:03:47.294
I can't live without my family.

826
01:03:48.962 --> 01:03:50.431
- Well, you should have
thought about that before.

827
01:03:52.099 --> 01:03:54.501
- Look, I know what shitty
thing I done to you,

828
01:03:56.370 --> 01:03:59.106
but I was lonely and
you were never there.

829
01:03:59.973 --> 01:04:01.375
I used to phone and phone.

830
01:04:03.210 --> 01:04:04.345
You and that bloody job.

831
01:04:04.378 --> 01:04:05.446
- So it's my fault.

832
01:04:06.581 --> 01:04:09.049
Jesus, why are you so needy?

833
01:04:09.083 --> 01:04:11.586
Big deal, I missed
a few of your calls.

834
01:04:11.619 --> 01:04:12.986
I was working.

835
01:04:14.121 --> 01:04:16.357
I worked hard to make
a name for myself

836
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:19.126
so that people could look
up to me and not gossip

837
01:04:19.159 --> 01:04:21.161
about what happened
to me and my family.

838
01:04:22.930 --> 01:04:23.565
You don't understand.

839
01:04:23.598 --> 01:04:24.998
- I can imagine.

840
01:04:29.002 --> 01:04:29.970
- Why are you here?

841
01:04:30.938 --> 01:04:33.474
(birds chirping)

842
01:04:36.043 --> 01:04:37.311
- I went to see Omi.

843
01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:41.014
- What?

844
01:04:42.282 --> 01:04:43.917
- I went to see Omi.

845
01:04:43.951 --> 01:04:46.086
- You shouldn't have done
that. She's not well.

846
01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.020
- I'm not just gonna stand back

847
01:04:47.054 --> 01:04:48.155
and watch my family disappear.

848
01:04:48.188 --> 01:04:50.558
- There is nothing
that we can do.

849
01:04:50.592 --> 01:04:52.059
Perchta can't be killed.

850
01:04:52.092 --> 01:04:55.295
- No, but she can be wounded.

851
01:04:55.329 --> 01:04:57.131
(tense music)

852
01:04:57.164 --> 01:04:58.966
- What are you talking about?

853
01:04:58.999 --> 01:05:01.502
(tense music)

854
01:05:06.006 --> 01:05:09.243
- What is it? It's
Eleanor, isn't it?

855
01:05:09.276 --> 01:05:10.110
She's the key.

856
01:05:15.416 --> 01:05:16.250
- Yeah.

857
01:05:17.552 --> 01:05:21.121
Yeah, it is Eleanor
that Frau Perchta wants.

858
01:05:22.156 --> 01:05:24.191
It is the natural order.

859
01:05:24.224 --> 01:05:28.462
Eleanor is the only one
who can lift the curse.

860
01:05:28.495 --> 01:05:31.198
(tense music)

861
01:05:33.133 --> 01:05:36.203
And I will not let
you put at risk.

862
01:05:37.137 --> 01:05:37.971
- Tell me.

863
01:05:39.373 --> 01:05:42.109
(dramatic music)

864
01:05:43.076 --> 01:05:44.411
- Oh, very well.

865
01:05:47.214 --> 01:05:51.619
The legend of Frau Perchta
goes back many centuries

866
01:05:51.653 --> 01:05:54.087
and will continue for many more,

867
01:05:55.355 --> 01:05:58.058
because she cannot be killed.

868
01:05:59.561 --> 01:06:01.228
She is immortal.

869
01:06:02.095 --> 01:06:03.130
- But?

870
01:06:05.299 --> 01:06:08.969
- But she can be wounded

871
01:06:16.544 --> 01:06:19.747
by the wood of a
special evergreen tree.

872
01:06:21.248 --> 01:06:24.051
And legend has it that
once she is wounded,

873
01:06:24.719 --> 01:06:27.087
she will disappear for 12 years.

874
01:06:27.822 --> 01:06:29.289
And when she comes back,

875
01:06:31.158 --> 01:06:34.394
hopefully the curse
will be obliterated.

876
01:06:34.428 --> 01:06:36.163
- How?

877
01:06:36.196 --> 01:06:38.766
(dramatic music)

878
01:06:46.608 --> 01:06:49.343
(dramatic music)

879
01:06:55.349 --> 01:06:58.252
- Again, legend dictates
that Frau Perchta

880
01:06:58.285 --> 01:07:01.154
will not persecute
those who wound her.

881
01:07:03.858 --> 01:07:05.158
- So it has to be her.

882
01:07:06.694 --> 01:07:08.195
It has to be Eleanor.

883
01:07:08.228 --> 01:07:11.164
(dramatic music)

884
01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:21.308
(dramatic music)

885
01:07:22.677 --> 01:07:25.445
- But are you
willing to risk it?

886
01:07:27.114 --> 01:07:27.749
Again?

887
01:07:31.251 --> 01:07:32.286
- No.

888
01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:35.088
I won't put her in
any more danger.

889
01:07:35.122 --> 01:07:36.390
- Look, I love her too.

890
01:07:37.391 --> 01:07:39.192
- She's all I have.

891
01:07:41.563 --> 01:07:44.331
(dramatic music)

892
01:07:45.567 --> 01:07:46.668
- I'll do it.

893
01:07:53.541 --> 01:07:56.276
(dramatic music)

894
01:08:04.318 --> 01:08:05.553
- Frau Perchta!

895
01:08:08.355 --> 01:08:09.791
Are you sure this is going work?

896
01:08:09.824 --> 01:08:12.326
- Omi said this is
our only chance.

897
01:08:12.359 --> 01:08:13.528
- This is it.

898
01:08:13.561 --> 01:08:14.662
- This is it.

899
01:08:16.196 --> 01:08:18.231
- Frau Perchta!

900
01:08:18.265 --> 01:08:21.201
(dramatic music)

901
01:08:30.612 --> 01:08:33.380
(dramatic music)

902
01:08:41.455 --> 01:08:44.224
(dramatic music)

903
01:08:46.293 --> 01:08:47.127
Frau Perchta!

904
01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:52.366
(ominous whispering)
(dramatic music)

905
01:08:59.707 --> 01:09:02.810
(ominous whispering)

906
01:09:09.316 --> 01:09:10.918
(dramatic music)

907
01:09:10.952 --> 01:09:13.955
(ominous clicking)

908
01:09:13.988 --> 01:09:17.190
(footsteps tapping)

909
01:09:20.995 --> 01:09:24.197
(ominous screaming)

910
01:09:26.366 --> 01:09:29.336
(dramatic music)

911
01:09:31.839 --> 01:09:34.676
(Eleanor sobbing)

912
01:09:37.411 --> 01:09:40.347
- Are you okay, darling?

913
01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:42.650
It's okay. It's over now.

914
01:09:42.684 --> 01:09:43.518
It's over.

915
01:09:44.686 --> 01:09:46.453
- Come on. Let's go.

916
01:09:46.486 --> 01:09:48.422
- Where were we going?

917
01:09:48.455 --> 01:09:49.289
- Home.

918
01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:55.495
Together.
- Together or not at all.

919
01:09:57.297 --> 01:09:59.366
- Together or not at all.

920
01:09:59.399 --> 01:10:02.335
(dramatic music)

921
01:10:10.745 --> 01:10:13.514
(dramatic music)

922
01:10:21.656 --> 01:10:24.424
(dramatic music)

923
01:10:29.997 --> 01:10:33.400
(cheerful festive music)

924
01:10:41.374 --> 01:10:44.746
(cheerful festive music)

925
01:10:52.486 --> 01:10:55.923
(cheerful festive music)

926
01:11:01.562 --> 01:11:05.398
(singing in foreign language)

927
01:11:12.573 --> 01:11:16.010
(cheerful festive music)

928
01:11:24.384 --> 01:11:27.822
(cheerful festive music)

929
01:11:35.129 --> 01:11:38.933
(singing in foreign language)

930
01:11:49.476 --> 01:11:52.379
(people chattering)

931
01:11:54.148 --> 01:11:56.651
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

932
01:12:02.757 --> 01:12:03.591
- We did it.

933
01:12:04.559 --> 01:12:05.960
Back on top where we belong.

934
01:12:07.161 --> 01:12:10.497
- I did it, Ronnie.
And you are welcome.

935
01:12:10.531 --> 01:12:13.433
- You did. Your exclusive.

936
01:12:13.466 --> 01:12:15.435
You did it. Thank you, Ingrid.

937
01:12:17.572 --> 01:12:18.606
So how you doing?

938
01:12:21.441 --> 01:12:22.543
You still think about her?

939
01:12:23.978 --> 01:12:26.479
- Every day for at
least 30 seconds.

940
01:12:28.115 --> 01:12:29.550
She'll always be with me.

941
01:12:30.885 --> 01:12:32.553
- I was so sorry
to hear about Omi.

942
01:12:34.622 --> 01:12:36.423
- She carried on as
long as she could.

943
01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:38.526
Our protector.

944
01:12:40.561 --> 01:12:41.963
Without her, all
of this would...

945
01:12:45.032 --> 01:12:46.901
- The way you wrote about her.

946
01:12:46.934 --> 01:12:48.501
She's obviously quite the woman.

947
01:12:49.871 --> 01:12:50.738
- She was.

948
01:12:53.074 --> 01:12:55.543
To go on all those years
with that heartache,

949
01:12:56.476 --> 01:12:58.179
but she carried on.

950
01:12:58.212 --> 01:13:01.716
- Well, that's what any
of us would do, isn't it?

951
01:13:01.749 --> 01:13:05.553
We march on. Anyway,
how's Eleanor?

952
01:13:06.654 --> 01:13:08.589
- She's doing much better.

953
01:13:08.623 --> 01:13:09.891
We all are.

954
01:13:09.924 --> 01:13:11.525
- Good.

955
01:13:11.559 --> 01:13:14.595
And you and Frank have
managed to work things out?

956
01:13:14.629 --> 01:13:19.133
- We're getting there.
Little by little, day by day.

957
01:13:20.534 --> 01:13:24.739
- Baby steps. Slow and
steady wins the race, hey?

958
01:13:25.606 --> 01:13:29.110
Speaking of which. You
thought more about our offer?

959
01:13:30.244 --> 01:13:30.878
The promotion.

960
01:13:32.613 --> 01:13:34.115
You earned it fair and square.

961
01:13:35.516 --> 01:13:37.652
I don't want to see it
passed over with Jonathan.

962
01:13:37.685 --> 01:13:40.087
- You don't have to
ask me twice, Ronnie.

963
01:13:40.121 --> 01:13:41.522
When do I start?

964
01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:44.158
- I'm glad you asked.

965
01:13:45.159 --> 01:13:45.993
- What is it?

966
01:13:47.561 --> 01:13:48.162
- A novelist.

967
01:13:49.196 --> 01:13:49.964
Harry Newman.

968
01:13:51.666 --> 01:13:53.234
Found dead in his flat last week

969
01:13:53.267 --> 01:13:55.069
in the south of
France by his agent.

970
01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:57.705
Apparently lost his mind

971
01:13:57.738 --> 01:14:01.509
and... stabbed himself
in the heart.

972
01:14:01.542 --> 01:14:05.112
- Apparently.
- After seeing things,

973
01:14:06.247 --> 01:14:07.682
Things that go
bump in the night.

974
01:14:08.983 --> 01:14:13.587
Remember Ingrid, no
artist, no creator

975
01:14:13.621 --> 01:14:15.122
ever sets forth without hope.

976
01:14:16.691 --> 01:14:19.560
Even if the thing they
create appears to be carved

977
01:14:19.593 --> 01:14:22.029
out of pitch black despair.

978
01:14:24.865 --> 01:14:25.666
Cheers.

979
01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:27.702
(dramatic music)

980
01:14:27.735 --> 01:14:29.570
(glass clinking)

981
01:14:29.603 --> 01:14:32.239
(uplifting music)

982
01:16:47.708 --> 01:16:50.845
(cheerful festive music)

983
01:19:08.082 --> 01:19:11.018
(dramatic music)
