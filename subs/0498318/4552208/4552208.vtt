00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
<i>My son's story
begins in the ocean.</i>

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.770
<i>A place full of secrets.</i>

3
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.300
<i>Some are beautiful,
some are dangerous.</i>

4
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.000
<i>Its mysteries have baffled
mankind for centuries.</i>

5
00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:17.500
<i>None more so than the Bermuda Triangle.</i>

6
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.140
<i>But in order to understand the Triangle,
you must understand my son.</i>

7
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.290
<i>Although he lives among you, he was
born in the darkest reaches of the sea.</i>

8
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.280
<i>I'd hoped to teach him
the ways of the world.</i>

9
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.500
<i>How to lead a good life
and become a good man.</i>

10
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.760
<i>But then...
I was taken from him.</i>

11
00:01:01.336 --> 00:01:04.680
<i>Turtle 1,
Turtle 1.</i>

12
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.000
Tempest Key coast guard to Turtle 1.
Atlana, you're out there ?

13
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.070
<i> Flying high and free.</i>

14
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.700
All the hatcheries were undisturbed.

15
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.730
You missed me ?

16
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.690
More than I can say on an open frequency.

17
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.240
How do your new research assistant pan out?

18
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.840
He's got something to tell you.

19
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.110
<i>Dad, Mum let me touch this big old sea turtle.</i>

20
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.700
<i>It was the coolest thing ever..</i>

21
00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:34.280
And dad, I hold my breathe
under water for almost five minutes.

22
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.080
Hey, that is incredible, kiddo.
I swear, you must be part of fish.

23
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.700
Hey, we're less than an hour away.
You wanna grab a pizza and meet us?

24
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.330
Tom ?

25
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.420
Tom, can you read me ?

26
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.950
Oh, my God.

27
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.040
Atlana, sweetheart, I lost you.

28
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.533
Atlana ?

29
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.000
Arthur, buckle on!

30
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.000
Honey, get in your seat.

31
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.080
O'Hara, do we get a storm brewing out there ?

32
00:02:19.288 --> 00:02:21.755
No, sir.
Blue skies for 500 miles.

33
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.133
<i> Hold on. </i>

34
00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:46.644
Mommy !

35
00:02:47.022 --> 00:02:48.555
Mommy help me !

36
00:02:53.955 --> 00:02:54.888
Mommy.

37
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.866
Mommy help me !

38
00:02:55.955 --> 00:02:57.533
I'm stuck. I can't get out.

39
00:02:57.666 --> 00:02:58.911
They're coming for you.

40
00:02:58.977 --> 00:03:02.155
You have to get to the surface.
Do good with your life.

41
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:04.777
I will find you again, I promise.

42
00:03:04.844 --> 00:03:06.400
I love you, Orin.

43
00:04:24.488 --> 00:04:25.355
Mommy ?

44
00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.066
Mom ?

45
00:06:00.177 --> 00:06:02.888
Morning, A.C.
You had a busy night...

46
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.890
Come on, get out of here.

47
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.044
What'd I do this time, sheriff?

48
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.070
Oh, it depends on where you were
at ten o'clock last night?

49
00:06:10.088 --> 00:06:12.790
I don't wear a watch.
I can't tell you.

50
00:06:12.888 --> 00:06:16.200
Then you didn't break into Neptune World
and free five dolphins?

51
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.600
- You got the wrong man...
- Is that so ?

52
00:06:19.755 --> 00:06:20.530
All right....

53
00:06:21.088 --> 00:06:23.720
How do you explain these Kodak moments ?

54
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.160
Sir, come on.

55
00:06:30.444 --> 00:06:32.960
Any ten year old with a PC could have
photoshopped those pictures.

56
00:06:33.244 --> 00:06:34.550
Come on, AC.

57
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.690
Look, you're under arrest for breaking
and entering and animal endangerment.

58
00:06:37.955 --> 00:06:38.955
Endangerment ?

59
00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:43.060
Come on, I've seen port-a-potties that were
cleaner than in that theme park.
I was doing those dolphins a favor.

60
00:06:43.177 --> 00:06:45.530
Yeah, the world is full
of misunderstood heroes.

61
00:06:45.755 --> 00:06:47.688
Come on.

62
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.177
Thanks for bailing me out, dad.

63
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.733
I promise I'll pay you back.

64
00:06:53.866 --> 00:06:55.644
A.C, I know your heart is
on the right place,

65
00:06:55.755 --> 00:06:57.730
but come on this is the third time this year.

66
00:06:57.822 --> 00:06:59.622
Well I guess this is the day
when you wish you never would...

67
00:06:59.688 --> 00:07:01.933
- ... have signed those adoption papers.
- Hey, kiddo.

68
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.533
No matter how many times you screw up
and you're definitely going for the record here,

69
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.133
I will always be your father

70
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.622
All right, I gotta go to work.

71
00:07:09.688 --> 00:07:11.755
You know, it's ten years today
since Mom disappeared.

72
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.111
AC, please, don't.

73
00:07:14.177 --> 00:07:15.355
Don't do this to yourself.

74
00:07:15.422 --> 00:07:18.444
But we were flying over the Bermuda Triangle.
She called me Orin

75
00:07:18.533 --> 00:07:20.400
She said she had so
much to tell me.

76
00:07:26.755 --> 00:07:29.266
Didn't she also say do
good with your life ?

77
00:07:29.333 --> 00:07:30.844
I don't see you fixated on that.

78
00:07:32.355 --> 00:07:35.777
You should be at Stanford right now,
not worrying about being incarcerated.

79
00:07:36.177 --> 00:07:39.488
I'm not leaving Tempest Key until
I find out what happened to mom.

80
00:07:39.533 --> 00:07:42.400
Look, I miss her too.
But you're not a teenager anymore.

81
00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:46.266
You have so much potential.

82
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.333
I hate to see it go to waste.

83
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.355
Look I've messed up.

84
00:07:52.111 --> 00:07:53.933
I'm sorry.

85
00:07:54.533 --> 00:07:56.088
If you're really sorry,

86
00:07:59.044 --> 00:08:03.610
pull your life together, kiddo.
I'll see you later.

87
00:08:28.622 --> 00:08:29.888
Rough night ?

88
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.844
No... No, then that was fine.

89
00:08:33.955 --> 00:08:36.266
But this day keeps sucking
more and more by a minute.

90
00:08:36.311 --> 00:08:38.400
Why are you putting a
for-sale sign on my boat?

91
00:08:38.488 --> 00:08:40.422
Technically, the boat's
still mine.

92
00:08:40.444 --> 00:08:42.755
I figured it was time for me
to cut my losses.

93
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.777
Eva.

94
00:08:44.822 --> 00:08:47.822
I know you're mad about the chargers
I blew off this morning.

95
00:08:47.888 --> 00:08:51.022
You know, there's something ironic about
watching five cardiologist,

96
00:08:51.066 --> 00:08:52.511
have a heart attack when you tell them

97
00:08:52.577 --> 00:08:53.888
their diving instructor is in jail.

98
00:08:53.911 --> 00:08:58.644
Technically, it was a holding cell
and the plan was not to get arrested.

99
00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:02.800
You know, that's what you said when you swam
aboard the cruise ship and ran out the bar tab.

100
00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.666
It was a wedding.

101
00:09:04.733 --> 00:09:08.177
You know, I got caught up in the moment.
I bought everyone around.

102
00:09:08.422 --> 00:09:12.577
And for the record, the bridesmaids did said that
my toast was incredibly romantic.

103
00:09:12.666 --> 00:09:15.822
Well, maybe one of them should have wired you
the money to cover the bill.

104
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.266
You're not really gonna sell
my boat, are you ?

105
00:09:22.288 --> 00:09:25.066
AC, come on, we're supposed to be
business partners.

106
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:28.266
Why did you pick last night
to go Greenpeace on me?

107
00:09:33.022 --> 00:09:35.400
You wanna know the real reason
why I freed those dolphins?

108
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.266
It's because I felt like
they were calling to me.

109
00:09:47.444 --> 00:09:49.688
So what do you say, you can talk
to fish now ?

110
00:09:50.511 --> 00:09:54.740
Dolphins are mammals and...
No, it was more... They, huh...

111
00:09:56.333 --> 00:09:57.711
Weird empathy...

112
00:10:02.422 --> 00:10:04.844
If you want, I can call a friend
over at dolphin rescue

113
00:10:04.866 --> 00:10:06.866
and we can set up a legal defence fund.

114
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.688
Ok...
Ok. Thanks.

115
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:11.333
Don't worry.

116
00:10:11.888 --> 00:10:13.910
And get to work.

117
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.222
Gettin' tired of
staring at these bottles.

118
00:10:23.533 --> 00:10:25.844
Anyone around here wanna
afford me a drink?

119
00:10:26.622 --> 00:10:28.533
Little early for happy hour,
don't you think?

120
00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:34.311
You're Tom Curry's boy.
I've seen you diving at Mercy Reef.

121
00:10:35.266 --> 00:10:36.955
Didn't realize I had a fan club.

122
00:10:37.044 --> 00:10:38.320
You don't.

123
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.466
You're in a light house at an endless point.

124
00:10:41.244 --> 00:10:43.400
Goals of nothing on my view.

125
00:10:44.355 --> 00:10:45.733
It sounds beautiful.

126
00:10:47.333 --> 00:10:50.155
I remember the day your mother's
plane went down.

127
00:10:52.266 --> 00:10:54.466
That cloudless Caribbean sky.

128
00:10:55.022 --> 00:10:57.511
God couldn't have painted a prettier picture.

129
00:10:58.622 --> 00:11:01.022
Then out of nowhere came this storm.

130
00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.111
I'm sorry, who are you ?

131
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.955
Name's McCaffery.

132
00:11:11.866 --> 00:11:13.200
Keep the change.

133
00:11:15.288 --> 00:11:16.377
Arthur...

134
00:11:17.288 --> 00:11:20.133
If you look hard and long
enough into the deep.

135
00:11:20.911 --> 00:11:23.770
Something's going to start looking back.

136
00:11:25.644 --> 00:11:27.666
Watch yourself.

137
00:11:45.422 --> 00:11:48.800
<i>This is cost guard rescue.
We have a possible ship break victim.</i>

138
00:11:56.555 --> 00:11:59.866
<i>This is cost guard rescue.
We've got an unidentified male, mid-twenties.</i>

139
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.444
- ...He's hypothermic.
- Pupils aren't responding.

140
00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:12.955
They're coming.
I mu... I must warn Orin.

141
00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:16.133
Take it easy, buddy.
Take it easy...

142
00:12:16.244 --> 00:12:17.888
We're taking you to the hospital..

143
00:12:19.533 --> 00:12:23.088
<i>This is unit 66. We are on route
to Mercy Reef hospital.</i>

144
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.222
Don't forget to take left to Cuba, Torres.

145
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.666
You think, I'm taking directions from you Munts?
You'd get lost in a two lane highway.

146
00:12:40.577 --> 00:12:42.555
- Lieutenant Torres.
- Commandant Alley.

147
00:12:42.577 --> 00:12:45.755
You've got a new mission...
coordinates in your NavCom.

148
00:12:46.511 --> 00:12:48.311
You're flying over Mercy reef.

149
00:12:48.711 --> 00:12:52.422
- Permission to speak freely.
- Go ahead.

150
00:12:52.466 --> 00:12:56.066
Sir, if you've given me an easier assignment
because you don't believe

151
00:12:56.155 --> 00:12:58.977
I can handle the rigors of this program
you're a 100%...

152
00:12:59.022 --> 00:13:00.955
This is not the LPGA, Torres.

153
00:13:01.022 --> 00:13:02.933
You tee off with the men.

154
00:13:03.688 --> 00:13:06.511
These orders come from way above my head.

155
00:13:06.733 --> 00:13:09.244
They told me to put my best pilot on it.

156
00:13:09.288 --> 00:13:11.622
They need a clean sweep of the area.

157
00:13:12.244 --> 00:13:15.111
Now about blowing off sunshine off your backside.
You're ready to fly?

158
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.555
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

159
00:13:16.711 --> 00:13:19.777
Now, the coast guards have pulled a
John Doe off the Reef.

160
00:13:19.866 --> 00:13:23.777
No boat, no I.D and no idea
where he came from.

161
00:13:24.133 --> 00:13:26.288
Almost ended up part of the food chain

162
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.422
If you see anything out of the ordinary,
you let me know.

163
00:13:50.644 --> 00:13:52.933
Lieutenant Torres reporting
as ordered.

164
00:13:53.555 --> 00:13:57.311
I'm flying over Mercy Reef,
there's nothing out here, guys.

165
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.866
Wait a second, something's below
the surface, following me.

166
00:14:14.911 --> 00:14:16.444
It's coming on fast.

167
00:14:34.066 --> 00:14:36.333
Hang on... It just dropped back.

168
00:14:36.377 --> 00:14:38.044
I'm gonna circle around.

169
00:14:46.044 --> 00:14:47.333
There is a disturbance in the ocean!

170
00:14:48.644 --> 00:14:51.333
There's a light... It...

171
00:15:26.955 --> 00:15:30.733
- It's you...
- Welcome back.

172
00:15:32.444 --> 00:15:34.666
Doctors said I could wait here until you woke up.

173
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.955
I hope the Navy doesn't have a
"You break it, you bought it" policy.

174
00:15:43.266 --> 00:15:44.355
You remember anything?

175
00:15:45.066 --> 00:15:48.200
Just a flash of light.

176
00:15:50.711 --> 00:15:54.222
Then I was flying through the water.

177
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.555
And you were carrying me.

178
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.711
And we were going so fast.

179
00:16:06.177 --> 00:16:09.822
You know, when you're drowning,
your brain loses oxygen

180
00:16:09.866 --> 00:16:13.733
And you start to see things that aren't real.
Maybe you should rest.

181
00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:20.288
Is that your way of saying that I'm crazy?

182
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.222
Your plane crashed at 700 miles an hour.

183
00:16:26.755 --> 00:16:29.600
So I'm gonna reserve judgment
until the painkillers wear off.

184
00:16:32.822 --> 00:16:34.444
I better go tell the nurse you're awake.

185
00:16:36.288 --> 00:16:37.044
Wait...

186
00:16:38.644 --> 00:16:39.755
What's your name?

187
00:16:40.711 --> 00:16:41.888
It's not important.

188
00:16:42.977 --> 00:16:46.866
You saved my life.
It's important to me.

189
00:16:48.533 --> 00:16:49.888
A.C.

190
00:17:36.444 --> 00:17:37.577
Orin?

191
00:17:38.177 --> 00:17:41.888
They know, you're here.
They know you survived.

192
00:17:42.244 --> 00:17:43.822
Why did you call me that?

193
00:17:44.866 --> 00:17:46.466
Where did you get this necklace?

194
00:17:46.555 --> 00:17:49.222
They're coming... For you...

195
00:17:49.844 --> 00:17:53.422
- Who are you?
- Visiting hours are over.

196
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.755
Who the hell are you?

197
00:17:57.266 --> 00:17:59.555
This badge means I'm the only
one asking questions.

198
00:18:02.777 --> 00:18:04.377
Where are you taking him?

199
00:18:06.755 --> 00:18:08.511
I said where're you taking him?

200
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.355
I asked you a question.

201
00:18:14.488 --> 00:18:16.044
Where are you taking him?

202
00:18:20.644 --> 00:18:21.888
We got him.

203
00:18:47.533 --> 00:18:48.888
When did he wake up ?

204
00:18:49.088 --> 00:18:50.577
Five minutes ago.

205
00:18:50.866 --> 00:18:53.244
Is he displaying any violent tendencies like the others?

206
00:18:53.288 --> 00:18:57.044
No, Sir... This is the file you
requested from the NAVY archives.

207
00:18:57.111 --> 00:18:59.911
The dental records match our John Doe.

208
00:19:00.066 --> 00:19:04.955
Hansen Gus Thompson. Member of flight 19
that disappeared December 5th.

209
00:19:05.288 --> 00:19:08.622
1945... Bermuda Triangle.

210
00:19:16.466 --> 00:19:18.044
Welcome home Hansen Thompson.

211
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.933
Where the hell have you been
for the last 60 years?

212
00:19:32.977 --> 00:19:36.733
Just tell him that called his son. It's about the man he pulled off Mercy Reef this morning.

213
00:19:37.022 --> 00:19:41.755
...That's the bitch. I tell you where I got the
perfect spot in the house for the lady. Right above....

214
00:19:41.822 --> 00:19:43.266
Easy.

215
00:19:43.422 --> 00:19:45.533
I've already told them to dock some place else and

216
00:19:45.577 --> 00:19:48.088
I'm gonna report the boat tomorrow to the Fish and Wildlife.

217
00:19:48.244 --> 00:19:50.222
Fines not gonna stop these guys.

218
00:19:50.844 --> 00:19:54.000
I just gonna go remind them about the catch and release policy of marlin.

219
00:19:54.133 --> 00:19:58.244
AC, kicking the crap out of a bunch of fishermen
is only gonna lead you back in jail.

220
00:20:00.288 --> 00:20:01.755
Okay ?

221
00:20:07.466 --> 00:20:10.022
It's amazing how cruel people can be.

222
00:20:11.977 --> 00:20:15.377
Yeah... It bothers me more and more.

223
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.955
That marlin should be in the ocean and not
hanging above some moron's fireplace.

224
00:20:21.377 --> 00:20:23.800
Maybe some day, the fish will get their revenge.

225
00:20:25.133 --> 00:20:28.933
I don't know, I think rednecks
make pretty ugly trophies.

226
00:20:30.155 --> 00:20:31.600
I'm Nadia.

227
00:20:31.888 --> 00:20:34.377
I heard you're pretty amazing under the water.

228
00:20:36.711 --> 00:20:38.866
If you would like to take me diving,
I'm free tomorrow.

229
00:20:41.533 --> 00:20:44.377
I was hoping
we could do something now.

230
00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:48.466
- Let's get out of here.
- Great idea.

231
00:20:50.511 --> 00:20:54.755
- Let's go for a swim.
- Master of my mind.

232
00:21:09.044 --> 00:21:10.777
You're not bad under the water yourself.

233
00:21:11.333 --> 00:21:12.911
Years of practice.

234
00:21:13.733 --> 00:21:17.800
You know, we met a long time ago.

235
00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:20.666
Are you sure about that ?

236
00:21:21.711 --> 00:21:23.711
Because I definitely would have remembered you.

237
00:21:24.777 --> 00:21:26.844
Let me refresh your memory.

238
00:21:36.466 --> 00:21:37.400
Nadia ?

239
00:21:42.155 --> 00:21:44.333
Ok, You're already starting to freak me out here.

240
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.666
Nadia ?

241
00:22:09.288 --> 00:22:11.533
I hate those damn things.

242
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.111
What the hell was she ?

243
00:22:15.533 --> 00:22:18.822
Get your clothes on.
We need to talk.

244
00:22:25.688 --> 00:22:29.355
Once a siren has you in her gaze, there's nothing a man can do.

245
00:22:30.355 --> 00:22:31.822
Siren ?

246
00:22:32.422 --> 00:22:33.511
Of course.

247
00:22:34.866 --> 00:22:36.600
You act like you see them all the time.

248
00:22:36.844 --> 00:22:38.444
I've seen my fair share.

249
00:22:39.133 --> 00:22:41.377
Unfortunately my aim's a little rusty.

250
00:22:42.133 --> 00:22:45.844
The only way to kill those scary bitches is
to nail them between the eyes.

251
00:22:46.511 --> 00:22:47.466
Who are you?

252
00:22:48.311 --> 00:22:50.355
An exiled like you and your mother.

253
00:22:52.777 --> 00:22:54.466
Exiled from where?

254
00:22:55.133 --> 00:22:58.288
It's called different names by different cultures.

255
00:22:58.777 --> 00:23:01.200
You probably know it by its most famous.

256
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.422
Atlantis.

257
00:23:04.377 --> 00:23:05.688
Atlantis ?

258
00:23:09.222 --> 00:23:10.822
Next time you're in Atlantis,

259
00:23:10.888 --> 00:23:13.422
Could you say hi to Captain Nemo
and the Little Mermaid for me ?

260
00:23:13.488 --> 00:23:15.311
You think I wanted to be the one to tell you ?

261
00:23:15.355 --> 00:23:17.533
No, I think you need to lay off the booze, old man.

262
00:23:18.533 --> 00:23:19.644
It pickled your brain.

263
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.866
You can't run away from you true calling, Orin.

264
00:23:37.044 --> 00:23:38.488
So let me get this straight...

265
00:23:39.577 --> 00:23:41.511
My parents were the rulers of Atlantis.

266
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.044
So I guess, technically, that would make me...

267
00:23:45.066 --> 00:23:46.466
A prince.

268
00:23:48.155 --> 00:23:51.377
You know, the fact that you can say that with
with a straight face is impressive.

269
00:23:53.022 --> 00:23:54.244
Let me ask you a question.

270
00:23:55.044 --> 00:23:57.333
Does Atlantis have a retractable dome?

271
00:23:57.444 --> 00:24:00.111
Or does everyone just swim around in
there like a bunch of fish?

272
00:24:00.222 --> 00:24:01.711
Don't mock me.

273
00:24:03.822 --> 00:24:05.933
You think I don't know how absurd this sounds?

274
00:24:06.511 --> 00:24:08.822
But you saw that siren.
Was that a joke?

275
00:24:12.777 --> 00:24:16.311
Okay, so if Atlantis exists...
Then how come...

276
00:24:16.311 --> 00:24:19.800
..no sub sonar or deep sea probe
has been able to discover it?

277
00:24:19.844 --> 00:24:23.488
because it's cloaked in a shroud no modern
technology can penetrate.

278
00:24:24.288 --> 00:24:25.955
The Bermuda Triangle.

279
00:24:33.355 --> 00:24:35.466
Your father was a man of peace.

280
00:24:37.511 --> 00:24:40.822
They were others who wanted to
wage war against the surface world.

281
00:24:41.755 --> 00:24:44.222
Your father resisted.

282
00:24:44.888 --> 00:24:46.555
So what? They killed him?

283
00:24:49.688 --> 00:24:51.800
Now they want me dead too.

284
00:24:53.066 --> 00:24:55.133
I managed to get you and your mother out.

285
00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:58.511
Knew the only place you would be safe was up here.

286
00:24:59.377 --> 00:25:02.733
You were found on Mercy Reef,
by a young coast guard lieutenant.

287
00:25:05.888 --> 00:25:07.066
My dad.

288
00:25:10.444 --> 00:25:11.333
Then he knows.

289
00:25:12.644 --> 00:25:13.488
No.

290
00:25:14.933 --> 00:25:17.333
Your mother insisted that we said nothing.

291
00:25:18.755 --> 00:25:22.600
She probably thought
she could hide you from you true destiny.

292
00:25:22.644 --> 00:25:24.622
Yeah, and what's my true destiny, huh?

293
00:25:25.288 --> 00:25:30.800
To defend this world you've embraced as your own and protect the ocean from which you were born.

294
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.644
So you want me to fight sirens
and Standard Oil?

295
00:25:33.977 --> 00:25:34.955
Is that it?

296
00:25:35.088 --> 00:25:36.244
You know what? Forget it.

297
00:25:36.488 --> 00:25:38.466
Find somebody else.
I'm not interested.

298
00:25:38.533 --> 00:25:41.377
You can't avoid your responsibilities, Orin.

299
00:25:42.911 --> 00:25:44.844
It's in your bones and you know it.

300
00:25:45.955 --> 00:25:47.177
This is insane.

301
00:25:48.266 --> 00:25:50.622
I'm a dive shop owner.

302
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.688
I'm not the protector of the Seven Seas.

303
00:25:55.066 --> 00:25:57.222
Destiny is like a riptide.

304
00:25:58.533 --> 00:26:02.155
You never know what's pulling you in
until it's too late.

305
00:26:07.222 --> 00:26:12.733
So this girl, Nadia, is actually a
killer mermaid who...

306
00:26:12.777 --> 00:26:18.911
... wants to take you out because you're some
sort of under water royalty?

307
00:26:19.333 --> 00:26:21.444
I'm quite sure, yeah.

308
00:26:21.488 --> 00:26:23.577
Well, they always look so friendly on the Starbuck's cups.

309
00:26:26.377 --> 00:26:29.800
Well, I didn't believe it either until that
siren tried to kill me.

310
00:26:31.777 --> 00:26:33.688
She's coming back for me.

311
00:26:35.111 --> 00:26:38.577
Then I suggest a road trip to the desert
with a truck full of Evian.

312
00:26:39.555 --> 00:26:40.777
Eva.

313
00:26:42.311 --> 00:26:44.533
I think she is the creature that attacked my mom.

314
00:26:46.711 --> 00:26:48.511
I have to face her.

315
00:26:50.133 --> 00:26:52.866
You're really serious about this.

316
00:26:55.177 --> 00:26:58.644
You should close up for a couple of days...
Head out of town.

317
00:26:58.733 --> 00:27:00.644
I don't want you caught in the middle of this.

318
00:27:01.111 --> 00:27:02.533
And what about you?

319
00:27:04.133 --> 00:27:06.222
I'm taking the Quint to Atlas Point.

320
00:27:06.311 --> 00:27:08.155
McCaffery's got weapons there.

321
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.644
Well, looks like there's a storm coming anyway.

322
00:27:17.422 --> 00:27:20.133
Maybe I'll go visit my sister in Tampa.

323
00:27:21.711 --> 00:27:23.866
Look, I'm sorry about all this insanity.

324
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.377
Yeah, well, being a friend of yours always required a leap of faith.

325
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.911
Besides, some day you'll make it up
to me give me a cool title like...

326
00:27:33.355 --> 00:27:34.911
"Duchess of the Deep"

327
00:27:59.888 --> 00:28:03.088
I don't know how you escaped from Atlantis.

328
00:28:03.222 --> 00:28:05.555
But thank you for leading me to Orin.

329
00:28:09.466 --> 00:28:11.822
It's good to see you back on your feet,
Lieutenant Torres.

330
00:28:12.177 --> 00:28:14.400
Thank you, sir...
But I'm confused.

331
00:28:14.488 --> 00:28:17.155
I already went over the accident
report with commandant Alley.

332
00:28:17.222 --> 00:28:19.688
I understand that but
I'm the one who ordered the mission.

333
00:28:20.155 --> 00:28:22.088
I wanted to debrief you myself.

334
00:28:22.644 --> 00:28:24.422
And who exactly do you work for?

335
00:28:24.511 --> 00:28:26.422
Top dog, lieutenant.
Commander in Chief.

336
00:28:29.044 --> 00:28:32.555
I was curious about that flash of light that
you saw right before you lost control.

337
00:28:33.977 --> 00:28:36.711
To be honest sir,
I was disoriented.

338
00:28:36.777 --> 00:28:38.244
It could've been a sun flair.

339
00:28:39.022 --> 00:28:40.488
You wanna placate me.

340
00:28:41.022 --> 00:28:42.666
I won't think you've lost your mind.

341
00:28:43.066 --> 00:28:45.355
After all, you were flying
over the Bermuda Triangle.

342
00:28:48.288 --> 00:28:51.977
With all due respect, sir,
that's just a myth.

343
00:28:53.355 --> 00:28:55.644
I used to share that sentiment.

344
00:28:56.911 --> 00:28:58.644
What changed your mind?

345
00:28:59.777 --> 00:29:01.644
Why don't I show you?

346
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.155
Last year, this man, boarded
an oil platform...

347
00:29:08.222 --> 00:29:10.955
...in Golf of México and
attempted to blow it sky high.

348
00:29:11.533 --> 00:29:13.333
He was killed before he succeeded.

349
00:29:13.777 --> 00:29:15.266
His name was Evan Corday.

350
00:29:15.955 --> 00:29:18.800
He disappeared along with his yacht.

351
00:29:18.866 --> 00:29:22.888
Off the cost of Bermuda.
On July 6th 1905.

352
00:29:24.111 --> 00:29:28.288
It's impossible... It must have been a descendant
or somebody who looks like him.

353
00:29:28.333 --> 00:29:31.200
I'd agree with you, except that the finger
prints were perfect match.

354
00:29:32.266 --> 00:29:33.977
And he's not the first one to come back.

355
00:29:36.866 --> 00:29:38.355
Come back from where?

356
00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:40.955
That's what the project Novas
aims to find out.

357
00:29:41.466 --> 00:29:43.333
I want you to join us Lieutenant.

358
00:29:43.488 --> 00:29:45.911
Help unlock the mysteries
of the Bermuda Triangle.

359
00:29:46.866 --> 00:29:50.688
Sir, I'm a pilot... I don't know
what relevant experience I could offer.

360
00:29:51.888 --> 00:29:53.866
You have more experience than any of us.

361
00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:58.111
You witnessed something extraordinary out there
and you lived to tell the tale.

362
00:29:59.355 --> 00:30:02.333
I don't believe a pilot of your impeccable
record can be taken out of the sky

363
00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.777
by a sun flair or freak mechanical failure, lieutenant.

364
00:30:05.222 --> 00:30:09.533
Sir, I joined up to fly jets
and serve my country.

365
00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.200
Not chase windmills.

366
00:30:11.577 --> 00:30:13.444
This is not a fool's crusade.

367
00:30:14.311 --> 00:30:16.111
This is a matter of national security.

368
00:30:21.377 --> 00:30:25.488
All these files contain pictures of people who
have vanished in the Bermuda Triangle.

369
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:30.600
They are MIA's in an invisible war.
And Tempest Key is the front line.

370
00:30:33.488 --> 00:30:35.444
Yeah?

371
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.155
I'll be right there.

372
00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.377
If you want to see how real this is
come with me, lieutenant.

373
00:31:30.577 --> 00:31:33.755
Eva you need to hit the road or you're never gonna
to make it out of here before the storm.

374
00:31:33.822 --> 00:31:34.888
Once you lock down, I'll go.

375
00:31:34.911 --> 00:31:37.600
I don't want to come back and find half
our restaurant under water.

376
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.866
I got it, I got it...

377
00:31:48.488 --> 00:31:51.844
So once you've taken care of business...

378
00:31:52.622 --> 00:31:56.066
...We should talk to the bank about
a lender upgrade to your boat.

379
00:31:56.666 --> 00:31:58.777
Oh, great.

380
00:31:59.422 --> 00:32:01.666
Power lines have blown over.

381
00:32:02.088 --> 00:32:04.355
No, it must be the circuit breaker.

382
00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:06.044
Lights are still on the Captain Jack's.

383
00:32:12.177 --> 00:32:15.644
- Are you sure you know what you're doing?
- Yeah, trust me.

384
00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.688
Would it kill you to hold the flash light steady?

385
00:32:21.311 --> 00:32:23.000
It's very funny, Eva.

386
00:32:32.911 --> 00:32:35.444
Couldn't hide forever, Orin.

387
00:33:02.422 --> 00:33:04.200
Eva.

388
00:33:04.244 --> 00:33:09.377
Sorry about your friend.
But I'm more concerned about your life now.

389
00:33:09.444 --> 00:33:12.244
McCaffery...
She got you, too?

390
00:33:34.933 --> 00:33:36.666
Where is she taking us?

391
00:33:36.777 --> 00:33:39.844
Home. To Atlantis.

392
00:33:39.911 --> 00:33:41.711
To be executed.

393
00:33:42.222 --> 00:33:44.155
Why hasn't she got us already?

394
00:33:44.488 --> 00:33:47.111
You're a symbol of hope, Orin.

395
00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:52.111
If they kill you,
that hope dies too.

396
00:33:55.622 --> 00:34:00.488
- Then I need water.
- My flask, it's in my boot.

397
00:34:11.955 --> 00:34:13.644
Smash it!

398
00:34:34.022 --> 00:34:37.222
- How do we take her down?
- We aren't doing anything.

399
00:34:37.488 --> 00:34:39.777
You're getting off this boat.

400
00:34:39.822 --> 00:34:40.400
No!

401
00:34:40.422 --> 00:34:43.644
No! That thing took my mom
and attacked my friend.

402
00:34:43.688 --> 00:34:45.266
I'm not going anywhere until she's dead.

403
00:34:45.288 --> 00:34:48.711
I promised your father on his dying breath
I would protect you.

404
00:34:48.755 --> 00:34:50.955
I'm not breaking my word now.

405
00:34:52.533 --> 00:34:53.933
Do you have any weapons?

406
00:34:54.822 --> 00:34:57.044
Nadia.

407
00:35:12.111 --> 00:35:14.377
Your aim's got better.

408
00:35:19.577 --> 00:35:23.400
- Where is Orin?
- Rot in hell you jelly bitch!

409
00:35:24.444 --> 00:35:27.511
Now... Where is Orin ?

410
00:35:32.133 --> 00:35:34.222
I'm right here.

411
00:35:55.955 --> 00:35:59.266
Your mother can't protect you this time.

412
00:35:59.333 --> 00:36:01.866
What did you do to her?

413
00:36:01.933 --> 00:36:02.911
You'll find out.

414
00:36:05.244 --> 00:36:07.755
You're coming home, Orin.

415
00:36:08.533 --> 00:36:10.133
Orin ?

416
00:36:13.177 --> 00:36:15.400
Not today!

417
00:36:41.511 --> 00:36:43.022
Well done, Orin.

418
00:36:44.466 --> 00:36:46.511
Your father would have been proud.

419
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.688
I'm sorry, Eva.

420
00:37:22.133 --> 00:37:24.600
How much do you remember, Lieutenant Torres?

421
00:37:52.177 --> 00:37:54.777
You know, that siren was just the beginning.

422
00:37:55.466 --> 00:37:59.422
There're creatures in the deep you couldn't imagine
in your worst nightmares.

423
00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.555
Oh, that's reassuring.
Thanks a lot.

424
00:38:05.622 --> 00:38:07.355
I'm not here to make you feel good.

425
00:38:08.266 --> 00:38:10.044
I'm here to prepare you for the worst.

426
00:38:10.155 --> 00:38:12.955
Look, we should've started your training years ago.

427
00:38:14.977 --> 00:38:18.155
Then let's do it.
Let's start now.

428
00:38:19.755 --> 00:38:20.600
I'm ready.

429
00:38:24.111 --> 00:38:25.644
A birthday gift.

430
00:38:32.844 --> 00:38:36.288
Kind of feels like a book.
Not really much a reader.

431
00:38:36.355 --> 00:38:37.577
Just open it.

432
00:38:45.711 --> 00:38:48.844
Henry the 4th :
Parts one and two.

433
00:38:49.133 --> 00:38:51.288
Didn't really know Shakespeare
was in sequels.

434
00:38:52.022 --> 00:38:54.266
I expect for you
to have read them by next week.

435
00:38:55.866 --> 00:38:58.200
I gave up book reports
in sixth grade.

436
00:38:58.266 --> 00:38:59.755
This is part of your training.

437
00:39:01.488 --> 00:39:04.244
Right, see, when you said training, I thought, you meant...

438
00:39:04.377 --> 00:39:06.933
You know, wielding tridents, and
doing cool stuff in the water.

439
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.355
All in due time.

440
00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:12.977
Don't worry, there's plenty of sex and violence
in there to keep you interested.

441
00:39:13.644 --> 00:39:16.177
Can't you just say the highlights?
And tell me how it ends?

442
00:39:16.711 --> 00:39:18.955
The lesson isn't in the ending, Orin.

443
00:39:20.444 --> 00:39:22.177
It's in the journey.
