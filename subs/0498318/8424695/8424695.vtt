00:00:02.307 --> 00:00:04.900
<i>My son's story
begins in the ocean.</i>

2
00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:06.900
<i>A place full of secrets.</i>

3
00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:10.614
<i>Some are beautiful,
some are dangerous.</i>

4
00:00:11.995 --> 00:00:15.204
<i>Its mysteries have baffled
mankind for centuries.</i>

5
00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.019
<i>None more so than the Bermuda Triangle.</i>

6
00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.191
<i>But in order to understand the Triangle,
you must understand my son.</i>

7
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.495
<i>Although he lives among you, he was
born in the darkest reaches of the sea.</i>

8
00:00:31.709 --> 00:00:33.909
<i>I'd hoped to teach him
the ways of the world.</i>

9
00:00:34.391 --> 00:00:37.214
<i>How to lead a good life
and become a good man.</i>

10
00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:40.707
<i>But then...
I was taken from him.</i>

11
00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:05.491
<i>Turtle 1,
Turtle 1.</i>

12
00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:10.005
Tempest Key coast guard to Turtle 1.
Atlanna, you're out there?

13
00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:13.002
<i> Flying high and free.</i>

14
00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:15.695
All the hatcheries were undisturbed.

15
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.486
You missed me?

16
00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:20.914
More than I can say on an open frequency.

17
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.284
How'd your new research assistant pan out?

18
00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:26.712
Oh, he's got something to tell you.

19
00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.395
<i>Dad, Mum let me touch
this big old sea turtle.</i>

20
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.809
<i>It was the coolest thing ever.</i>

21
00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:36.412
And dad, I hold my breathe
under water for almost five minutes.

22
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.006
Hey, that is incredible, kiddo.
I swear, you must be part fish.

23
00:01:42.508 --> 00:01:45.397
Hey, we're less than an hour away.
You wanna grab a pizza and meet us?

24
00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:48.100
Tom?

25
00:01:48.888 --> 00:01:49.896
Tom, can you read me?

26
00:01:54.286 --> 00:01:55.407
Oh, my God.

27
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.202
Atlanna, sweetheart, I lost you.

28
00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:03.106
Atlanna?

29
00:02:08.505 --> 00:02:09.796
Arthur, buckle on!

30
00:02:16.507 --> 00:02:17.804
Honey, get in your seat.

31
00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:21.103
O'Hara, do we get a
storm brewing out there?

32
00:02:21.713 --> 00:02:24.019
No, sir.
Blue skies for 500 miles.

33
00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:30.884
<i> Hold on. </i>

34
00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:49.194
Mommy!

35
00:02:49.792 --> 00:02:50.794
Mommy help me!

36
00:02:56.204 --> 00:02:58.204
Mommy! Mommy help me!

37
00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:59.888
I'm stuck! I can't get out!

38
00:03:00.106 --> 00:03:01.197
They're coming for you.

39
00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:04.017
You have to get to the surface.
Do good with your life.

40
00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.812
I will find you again, I promise.

41
00:03:07.116 --> 00:03:08.301
I love you, Orin.

42
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:27.805
Mommy?

43
00:04:34.706 --> 00:04:35.706
Uh?

44
00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.507
Mom!

45
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.700
Morning, A.C.
You had a busy night.

46
00:06:12.892 --> 00:06:13.993
Come on, get out of here.

47
00:06:15.611 --> 00:06:16.906
What'd I do this time, sheriff?

48
00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:19.798
That depends on where you were
at ten o'clock last night?

49
00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:22.813
Hmm, I don't wear a watch.
I couldn't tell you.

50
00:06:23.098 --> 00:06:25.697
Then you didn't break into Neptune World
and free five dolphins?

51
00:06:27.202 --> 00:06:29.306
-You got the wrong man.
-Is that so?

52
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.199
All right.

53
00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:33.186
How do you explain these Kodak moments?

54
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:40.510
Sir, come on.

55
00:06:40.535 --> 00:06:43.203
Any ten year old with a PC could have
photoshopped those pictures.

56
00:06:43.303 --> 00:06:44.405
Come on, AC.

57
00:06:44.915 --> 00:06:48.013
Look, you're under arrest for breaking
and entering and animal endangerment.

58
00:06:48.038 --> 00:06:49.099
Endangerment?

59
00:06:49.124 --> 00:06:51.398
Come on, I've seen port-a-potties that
were cleaner than in that theme park.

60
00:06:51.423 --> 00:06:52.897
I was doing those dolphins a favor.

61
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.397
Yeah, the world is full
of misunderstood heroes.

62
00:06:56.311 --> 00:06:57.410
Come on.

63
00:07:00.989 --> 00:07:02.304
Thanks for bailing me out, dad.

64
00:07:02.698 --> 00:07:03.891
I promise I'll pay you back.

65
00:07:03.916 --> 00:07:05.694
A.C, I know your heart is
on the right place,

66
00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:07.608
but come on this is
the third time this year.

67
00:07:07.633 --> 00:07:09.590
Well I guess these are the days
when you wish you never would

68
00:07:09.615 --> 00:07:11.790
-have signed those adoption papers.
-Hey, kiddo.

69
00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:15.602
No matter how many times you screw up and
you're definitely going for the record here,

70
00:07:16.206 --> 00:07:17.604
I will always be your father.

71
00:07:18.505 --> 00:07:19.708
All right, I gotta go to work.

72
00:07:19.733 --> 00:07:21.902
You know, it's ten years today
since Mom disappeared.

73
00:07:22.104 --> 00:07:23.895
AC, please, don't.

74
00:07:24.209 --> 00:07:25.387
Don't do this to yourself.

75
00:07:25.412 --> 00:07:28.434
But we were flying over the
Bermuda Triangle. She called me Orin.

76
00:07:28.513 --> 00:07:30.380
She said she had so
much to tell me.

77
00:07:37.102 --> 00:07:38.998
Didn't she also say do
good with your life?

78
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:40.919
I don't see you fixated on that.

79
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.692
You should be at Stanford right now,
not worrying about being incarcerated.

80
00:07:46.514 --> 00:07:49.302
I'm not leaving Tempest Key until
I find out what happened to mom.

81
00:07:49.517 --> 00:07:52.201
Look, I miss her too.
But you're not a teenager anymore.

82
00:07:54.495 --> 00:07:56.195
You have so much potential.

83
00:07:56.604 --> 00:07:57.895
I hate to see it go to waste.

84
00:07:59.006 --> 00:08:00.021
Look I've messed up.

85
00:08:02.316 --> 00:08:03.392
I'm sorry.

86
00:08:04.896 --> 00:08:06.003
If you're really sorry,

87
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.785
pull your life together, kiddo.
I'll see you later.

88
00:08:38.801 --> 00:08:39.820
Rough night?

89
00:08:41.496 --> 00:08:43.394
No. No, the night was fine.

90
00:08:44.189 --> 00:08:46.292
But this day keeps sucking
more and more by a minute.

91
00:08:46.405 --> 00:08:48.302
Why are you putting a
for-sale sign on my boat?

92
00:08:48.905 --> 00:08:50.297
Technically, the boat's
still mine.

93
00:08:50.804 --> 00:08:52.698
Figured it was time for me
to cut my losses.

94
00:08:54.101 --> 00:08:55.106
Eva.

95
00:08:55.131 --> 00:08:57.600
I know you're mad about the chargers
I blew off this morning.

96
00:08:57.907 --> 00:09:01.249
You know, there's something ironic about
watching five cardiologist,

97
00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:02.626
have a heart attack when you tell them

98
00:09:02.651 --> 00:09:04.085
their diving instructor is in jail.

99
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:08.599
Now see, technically, it was a holding cell
and the plan was not to get arrested.

100
00:09:09.497 --> 00:09:11.232
You know, that's what
you said when you swam

101
00:09:11.256 --> 00:09:13.194
aboard the cruise ship
and ran out the bar tab.

102
00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:14.309
It was a wedding.

103
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.896
You know, I got caught up in the moment.
I bought everyone a round.

104
00:09:18.499 --> 00:09:22.396
And for the record, the bridesmaids did
said that my toast was incredibly romantic.

105
00:09:22.705 --> 00:09:25.861
Well, maybe one of them should have
wired you the money to cover the bill.

106
00:09:29.596 --> 00:09:31.476
You're not really gonna sell
my boat, are you?

107
00:09:32.501 --> 00:09:35.200
AC, come on, we're supposed to be
business partners.

108
00:09:35.309 --> 00:09:38.203
Why did you pick last night
to go Greenpeace on me?

109
00:09:43.202 --> 00:09:45.602
You want to know the real
reason why I freed those dolphins?

110
00:09:51.292 --> 00:09:53.294
It's because I felt like
they were calling to me.

111
00:09:57.695 --> 00:09:59.517
What are you saying,
you can talk to fish now?

112
00:10:00.597 --> 00:10:04.605
Dolphins are mammals and...
Nose, more... They, huh...

113
00:10:06.505 --> 00:10:07.883
Weird empathy.

114
00:10:12.602 --> 00:10:15.027
If you want, I can call a friend
over at dolphin rescue

115
00:10:15.052 --> 00:10:16.910
and we can set up a legal defense fund.

116
00:10:17.407 --> 00:10:19.915
OK.
OK. Thanks.

117
00:10:20.491 --> 00:10:21.513
Don't worry.

118
00:10:22.098 --> 00:10:23.192
And get to work.

119
00:10:30.995 --> 00:10:33.104
Getting' tired of
staring at these bottles.

120
00:10:33.702 --> 00:10:35.790
Anyone around here wanna
pour me a drink?

121
00:10:36.804 --> 00:10:38.596
Little early for happy hour,
don't you think?

122
00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:44.204
You're Tom Curry's boy.
I've seen you diving at Mercy Reef.

123
00:10:45.495 --> 00:10:46.899
Didn't realize I had a fan club.

124
00:10:47.302 --> 00:10:48.398
You don't.

125
00:10:48.504 --> 00:10:50.570
You're in a light house
at an endless point.

126
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.298
Goals of nothing on my view.

127
00:10:54.588 --> 00:10:55.791
It sounds beautiful.

128
00:10:57.505 --> 00:10:59.993
I remember the day your mother's
plane went down.

129
00:11:02.405 --> 00:11:04.289
That cloudless Caribbean sky.

130
00:11:05.102 --> 00:11:07.394
God couldn't have
painted a prettier picture.

131
00:11:08.802 --> 00:11:10.703
Then out of nowhere came this storm.

132
00:11:16.899 --> 00:11:18.094
I'm sorry, who are you ?

133
00:11:19.503 --> 00:11:20.691
Name's McCaffery.

134
00:11:21.902 --> 00:11:23.099
Keep the change.

135
00:11:25.514 --> 00:11:26.615
Arthur...

136
00:11:27.301 --> 00:11:29.981
If you look hard and long
enough into the deep.

137
00:11:31.105 --> 00:11:33.026
Something's going to start looking back.

138
00:11:36.122 --> 00:11:37.197
Watch yourself.

139
00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.403
<i>This is coast guard rescue.
We have a possible ship break victim.</i>

140
00:12:06.497 --> 00:12:10.022
<i>This is coast guard rescue. We've
got an unidentified male, mid-twenties.</i>

141
00:12:10.233 --> 00:12:12.235
-He's hypothermic.
-Pupils aren't responding.

142
00:12:19.396 --> 00:12:23.827
They're coming. I mu...
I must warn Orin. Orin.

143
00:12:23.896 --> 00:12:25.710
Alright, take it easy, buddy.
Take it easy.

144
00:12:26.408 --> 00:12:27.804
We're taking you to the hospital.

145
00:12:29.909 --> 00:12:33.003
<i>This is unit 66. We are on route
to Mercy Reef hospital.</i>

146
00:12:37.606 --> 00:12:38.606
Let's go!

147
00:12:42.907 --> 00:12:44.986
Don't forget to take left to Cuba, Torres.

148
00:12:45.011 --> 00:12:48.894
You think, I'm taking directions from you
Munts? You'd get lost in a two lane highway.

149
00:12:50.791 --> 00:12:52.608
-Lieutenant Torres.
-Commandant Alley.

150
00:12:52.633 --> 00:12:55.701
You've got a new mission.
Coordinates are in your NavCom.

151
00:12:56.511 --> 00:12:58.195
You're flying over Mercy Reef.

152
00:12:58.996 --> 00:13:02.294
-Permission to speak freely.
-Go ahead.

153
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.798
Sir, if you've given me an easier
assignment because you don't believe

154
00:13:05.823 --> 00:13:08.572
I can handle the rigors of this program
you're a 100%...

155
00:13:08.597 --> 00:13:10.898
This is not the LPGA, Torres.

156
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.600
You tee off with the men.

157
00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:16.300
These orders come from way above my head.

158
00:13:17.192 --> 00:13:19.091
They told me to put my best pilot on it.

159
00:13:19.594 --> 00:13:21.093
They need a clean sweep of the area.

160
00:13:22.493 --> 00:13:25.309
Now about blowing off sunshine
off your backside. You're ready to fly?

161
00:13:25.334 --> 00:13:26.491
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

162
00:13:27.212 --> 00:13:29.709
Now, the coast guards have pulled a
John Doe off the Reef.

163
00:13:29.995 --> 00:13:33.696
No boat, no I.D and no idea
where he came from.

164
00:13:34.304 --> 00:13:36.406
It's wrangled some
feathers of the food chain.

165
00:13:37.204 --> 00:13:39.486
If you see anything out of the ordinary,
you let me know.

166
00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:02.902
Lieutenant Torres reporting
as ordered.

167
00:14:03.512 --> 00:14:06.813
I'm flying over Mercy Reef,
there's nothing out here, guys.

168
00:14:22.109 --> 00:14:24.909
Wait a second, something's below
the surface, following me.

169
00:14:24.934 --> 00:14:26.467
It's coming on fast.

170
00:14:44.612 --> 00:14:46.207
Hang on. It just dropped back.

171
00:14:46.297 --> 00:14:47.500
I'm gonna circle around.

172
00:14:56.007 --> 00:14:57.539
There is a disturbance in the ocean!

173
00:14:59.101 --> 00:15:00.443
There's a light... It...

174
00:15:43.408 --> 00:15:47.114
-It's you.
-Welcome back.

175
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:51.097
Doctors said I could wait
here until you woke up.

176
00:15:52.897 --> 00:15:55.610
I hope the Navy doesn't have a
"You break it, you bought it" policy.

177
00:15:59.809 --> 00:16:00.896
You remember anything?

178
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:04.391
Just a flash of light.

179
00:16:07.209 --> 00:16:10.512
Then is... flying through the water.

180
00:16:13.505 --> 00:16:15.692
And you were carrying me.

181
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:20.101
And we were going so fast.

182
00:16:22.713 --> 00:16:26.105
You know, when you're drowning,
your brain loses oxygen

183
00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:29.997
And you start to see things that
aren't real. Maybe you should rest.

184
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.497
Is that your way of saying that I'm crazy?

185
00:16:40.102 --> 00:16:42.505
Your plane crashed at 700 miles an hour.

186
00:16:43.421 --> 00:16:45.922
So I'm gonna reserve judgment
until the painkillers wear off.

187
00:16:49.292 --> 00:16:50.902
I better go tell the nurse you're awake.

188
00:16:52.792 --> 00:16:53.798
Wait.

189
00:16:55.193 --> 00:16:56.200
What's your name?

190
00:16:57.302 --> 00:16:58.391
It's not important.

191
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.895
You saved my life.
It's important to me.

192
00:17:05.197 --> 00:17:06.205
AC.

193
00:17:52.902 --> 00:17:53.993
Orin?

194
00:17:54.806 --> 00:17:57.896
They know, you're here.
They know you survived.

195
00:17:58.908 --> 00:17:59.992
Why did you call me that?

196
00:18:01.511 --> 00:18:02.798
Where did you get this necklace?

197
00:18:03.206 --> 00:18:05.294
They're coming... For you...

198
00:18:06.797 --> 00:18:09.589
-Who are you?
-Visiting hours are over.

199
00:18:11.208 --> 00:18:12.292
Who the hell are you?

200
00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:15.896
This badge means I'm the only
one asking questions.

201
00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:20.506
Where are you taking him?

202
00:18:23.524 --> 00:18:24.792
I said where're you taking him?

203
00:18:28.514 --> 00:18:29.699
I asked you a question.

204
00:18:31.013 --> 00:18:32.195
Where are you taking him?

205
00:18:37.301 --> 00:18:38.308
We got him.

206
00:19:04.489 --> 00:19:05.504
When did he wake up?

207
00:19:05.908 --> 00:19:07.001
Five minutes ago.

208
00:19:07.307 --> 00:19:09.598
Is he displaying any violent
tendencies like the others?

209
00:19:09.623 --> 00:19:13.298
No, Sir. This is the file you
requested from the NAVY archives.

210
00:19:13.705 --> 00:19:16.198
The dental records match our John Doe.

211
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:21.303
Ensign Gus Thompson. Member of flight 19
that disappeared December 5th.

212
00:19:21.804 --> 00:19:24.701
1945... Bermuda Triangle.

213
00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:34.206
Welcome home Ensign Thompson.

214
00:19:38.003 --> 00:19:40.202
Where the hell have you been
for the last 60 years?

215
00:19:49.705 --> 00:19:51.489
Just tell him to call
his son. It's about the

216
00:19:51.513 --> 00:19:53.206
man he pulled off
Mercy Reef this morning.

217
00:19:53.231 --> 00:19:55.765
...the size of this bitch.
I tell you where I got the

218
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:58.323
perfect spot in the house
for the lady. Right above....

219
00:19:58.348 --> 00:19:59.513
Easy.

220
00:20:00.103 --> 00:20:01.826
I've already told them to
dock some place else and

221
00:20:01.851 --> 00:20:04.297
I'm gonna report the boat
tomorrow to the Fish and Wildlife.

222
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:06.582
Fines not gonna stop these guys.

223
00:20:07.792 --> 00:20:10.581
I just gonna go remind them about
the catch and release policy of marlin.

224
00:20:10.606 --> 00:20:14.297
AC, kicking the crap out of a bunch of
fishermen is only gonna lead you back in jail.

225
00:20:17.009 --> 00:20:18.106
Okay?

226
00:20:24.105 --> 00:20:26.297
It's amazing how cruel people can be.

227
00:20:28.625 --> 00:20:31.789
Yeah. It bothers me more and more.

228
00:20:32.304 --> 00:20:35.319
That marlin should be in the ocean,
not hanging on some moron's fireplace.

229
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:39.995
Maybe someday the
fish will get their revenge.

230
00:20:41.818 --> 00:20:44.903
I don't know. I think rednecks
make pretty ugly trophies.

231
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:47.998
I'm Nadia.

232
00:20:48.807 --> 00:20:50.701
I heard you're pretty
amazing under the water.

233
00:20:53.093 --> 00:20:55.408
If you would like me to take me diving,
I'm free tomorrow.

234
00:20:57.994 --> 00:21:00.218
I was hoping
we could do something now.

235
00:21:02.208 --> 00:21:04.723
-Let's get out of here.
-Great idea.

236
00:21:07.186 --> 00:21:10.999
-Let's go for a swim.
-Must've read my mind.

237
00:21:26.002 --> 00:21:27.702
You're not bad under the water yourself.

238
00:21:27.813 --> 00:21:28.902
Years of practice.

239
00:21:30.307 --> 00:21:33.992
You know, we met a long time ago.

240
00:21:35.792 --> 00:21:36.813
Are you sure about that?

241
00:21:38.401 --> 00:21:40.308
Because I definitely would
have remembered you.

242
00:21:41.506 --> 00:21:43.011
Let me refresh your memory.

243
00:21:53.003 --> 00:21:54.003
Nadia?

244
00:21:58.602 --> 00:22:00.609
OK, you're really
starting to freak me out here.

245
00:22:03.091 --> 00:22:04.098
Nadia?

246
00:22:25.906 --> 00:22:27.597
I hate those damn things.

247
00:22:30.193 --> 00:22:31.309
What the hell was she?

248
00:22:32.112 --> 00:22:34.816
Get your clothes on.
We need to talk.

249
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.206
Once a siren has you in her
gaze, there's nothing a man can do.

250
00:22:54.806 --> 00:23:00.502
A siren? Of course. You act
like you see them all the time.

251
00:23:00.993 --> 00:23:05.400
I've seen my fair share.
Unfortunately, my aim is a little rusty.

252
00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.700
The only way to kill those scaly
bitches is to nail them between the eyes.

253
00:23:10.805 --> 00:23:11.899
Who are you?

254
00:23:12.492 --> 00:23:14.101
An exile like you and your mother.

255
00:23:17.104 --> 00:23:18.793
Exile from where?

256
00:23:19.512 --> 00:23:22.200
It's called different
names by different cultures.

257
00:23:23.006 --> 00:23:27.406
You probably know by
its most famous: Atlantis.

258
00:23:28.609 --> 00:23:32.704
Atlantis. Yeah, right.

259
00:23:33.603 --> 00:23:35.543
Next time you're in
Atlantis, can you say hi

260
00:23:35.567 --> 00:23:37.506
to Captain Nemo and
the Little Mermaid for me?

261
00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:39.353
You think I wanted to
be the one to tell you ?

262
00:23:39.378 --> 00:23:41.399
No, I think you need to
lay off the booze, old man.

263
00:23:42.621 --> 00:23:43.700
It pickled your brain.

264
00:23:45.018 --> 00:23:47.702
You can't run away
from you true calling, Orin.

265
00:24:01.186 --> 00:24:02.397
So let me get this straight...

266
00:24:03.614 --> 00:24:05.492
My parents were the rulers of Atlantis.

267
00:24:07.099 --> 00:24:09.116
So I guess, technically,
that would make me...

268
00:24:09.308 --> 00:24:10.400
A prince.

269
00:24:12.793 --> 00:24:15.998
You know, the fact that you can say that
with with a straight face is impressive.

270
00:24:17.193 --> 00:24:18.292
Let me ask you a question.

271
00:24:19.299 --> 00:24:21.392
Does Atlantis has a retractable dome?

272
00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:24.292
Or does everyone just swim
around in there like a bunch of fish?

273
00:24:24.316 --> 00:24:25.805
Don't mock me.

274
00:24:28.017 --> 00:24:30.128
You think I don't know
how absurd this sounds?

275
00:24:30.593 --> 00:24:32.904
But you saw that siren.
Was that a joke?

276
00:24:37.502 --> 00:24:40.480
Okay, so if Atlantis exists...
Then how come

277
00:24:40.505 --> 00:24:43.692
no sub sonar or deep sea probe
has been able to discover it, huh?

278
00:24:43.901 --> 00:24:47.395
Because it's cloaked in a shroud no modern
technology can penetrate.

279
00:24:48.603 --> 00:24:49.998
The Bermuda Triangle.

280
00:24:57.594 --> 00:24:59.398
Your father was a man of peace.

281
00:25:01.705 --> 00:25:04.690
There were others who wanted to
wage war against the surface world.

282
00:25:06.108 --> 00:25:07.498
Your father resisted.

283
00:25:09.113 --> 00:25:10.190
So what? They killed him?

284
00:25:13.912 --> 00:25:15.304
Now they want me dead too.

285
00:25:17.208 --> 00:25:19.205
I managed to get you and your mother out.

286
00:25:20.213 --> 00:25:22.606
Knew the only place you
would be safe was up here.

287
00:25:23.692 --> 00:25:26.694
You were found on Mercy Reef,
by a young coast guard lieutenant.

288
00:25:30.004 --> 00:25:31.110
My dad.

289
00:25:34.608 --> 00:25:35.699
Then he knows.

290
00:25:36.792 --> 00:25:37.805
No.

291
00:25:39.308 --> 00:25:41.200
Your mother insisted that we said nothing.

292
00:25:43.099 --> 00:25:46.206
She probably thought
she could hide you from you true destiny.

293
00:25:46.716 --> 00:25:48.298
Yeah, and what's my true destiny, huh?

294
00:25:49.499 --> 00:25:52.140
To defend this world
you've embraced as your own

295
00:25:52.164 --> 00:25:54.805
and protect the ocean
from which you were born.

296
00:25:55.489 --> 00:25:57.599
So you want me to fight sirens
and Standard Oil?

297
00:25:58.112 --> 00:25:59.204
Is that it?

298
00:25:59.229 --> 00:26:00.385
You know what? Forget it.

299
00:26:00.595 --> 00:26:02.491
Find somebody else.
I'm not interested.

300
00:26:02.712 --> 00:26:08.699
You can't avoid your responsibility,
Orin. It's in your bones and you know it.

301
00:26:10.099 --> 00:26:17.600
This is insane. I'm a dive shop owner.
I'm not the protector of the Seven Seas!

302
00:26:19.205 --> 00:26:25.502
Destiny is like a riptide. You never
know it's pulling you until its too late.

303
00:26:31.593 --> 00:26:37.075
So this girl, Nadia, is actually a
killer mermaid who

304
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:42.914
wants to take you out because
you're some sort of under water royalty?

305
00:26:43.688 --> 00:26:44.897
In a clam shell, yeah.

306
00:26:44.922 --> 00:26:47.916
Huh, well they always look so
friendly on the Starbuck's cups.

307
00:26:50.698 --> 00:26:53.614
Well, I didn't believe it either until that
siren tried to kill me.

308
00:26:56.106 --> 00:26:57.493
She's coming back for me.

309
00:26:59.709 --> 00:27:02.623
Then I suggest a road trip to the desert
with a truck full of Evian.

310
00:27:04.012 --> 00:27:05.105
Eva.

311
00:27:06.711 --> 00:27:08.707
I think she is the creature
that attacked my mom.

312
00:27:11.113 --> 00:27:12.302
I have to face her.

313
00:27:14.511 --> 00:27:16.617
You're really serious about this.

314
00:27:19.402 --> 00:27:22.506
You should close up for a couple of days.
Head out of town.

315
00:27:23.007 --> 00:27:24.815
I don't want you caught
in the middle of this.

316
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:26.204
What about you?

317
00:27:28.493 --> 00:27:30.005
I'm taking the Quint to Atlas Point.

318
00:27:30.707 --> 00:27:31.993
McCaffery's got weapons there.

319
00:27:38.417 --> 00:27:40.293
Well, looks like there's
a storm coming anyway.

320
00:27:41.612 --> 00:27:43.499
Maybe I'll go visit my sister in Tampa.

321
00:27:45.794 --> 00:27:47.410
Look, I'm sorry about all this insanity.

322
00:27:49.107 --> 00:27:52.214
Yeah well, being friends with
you has always required a leap of faith.

323
00:27:52.996 --> 00:27:55.806
Besides, some day you'll make it up
to me give me a cool title like...

324
00:27:57.592 --> 00:27:58.798
"Duchess of the Deep"

325
00:28:24.494 --> 00:28:26.790
I don't know how you escaped from Atlantis.

326
00:28:27.811 --> 00:28:29.418
But thank you for leading me to Orin.

327
00:28:34.102 --> 00:28:36.395
Good to see you back on your feet,
Lieutenant Torres.

328
00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.508
Thank you, sir.
But I'm confused.

329
00:28:38.533 --> 00:28:41.114
I already went over the accident
report with commandant Haley.

330
00:28:41.209 --> 00:28:43.508
I understand that but
I'm the one who ordered the mission.

331
00:28:44.321 --> 00:28:46.226
I wanted to debrief you myself.

332
00:28:46.712 --> 00:28:48.312
And who exactly do you work for?

333
00:28:48.496 --> 00:28:50.497
Top dog, lieutenant.
Commander in Chief.

334
00:28:53.106 --> 00:28:56.503
I was curious about that flash of light
that you saw right before you lost control.

335
00:28:58.308 --> 00:29:00.494
To be honest sir,
I was disoriented.

336
00:29:01.007 --> 00:29:02.201
It could've been a sun flair.

337
00:29:03.206 --> 00:29:04.411
You wanna placate me.

338
00:29:05.203 --> 00:29:06.706
I won't think you've lost your mind.

339
00:29:07.407 --> 00:29:09.491
After all, you were flying
over the Bermuda Triangle.

340
00:29:12.801 --> 00:29:15.602
With all due respect, sir,
that's just a myth.

341
00:29:17.714 --> 00:29:18.995
I used to share that sentiment.

342
00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:22.406
What changed your mind?

343
00:29:24.212 --> 00:29:25.215
Why don't I show you?

344
00:29:30.306 --> 00:29:32.400
Last year, this man, boarded
an oil platform

345
00:29:32.425 --> 00:29:35.007
in Golf of Mexico and
attempted to blow it sky high.

346
00:29:35.816 --> 00:29:37.200
He was killed before he succeeded.

347
00:29:37.914 --> 00:29:39.194
His name was Evan Corday.

348
00:29:40.206 --> 00:29:42.494
He disappeared along with his yacht.

349
00:29:43.009 --> 00:29:46.605
Off the coast of Bermuda.
On July 6th 1905.

350
00:29:48.309 --> 00:29:52.304
It's impossible. It must have been a
descendant or somebody who looked like him.

351
00:29:52.405 --> 00:29:55.201
I'd agree with you, except that the finger
prints were perfect match.

352
00:29:56.403 --> 00:29:58.100
And he's not the first one to come back.

353
00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.110
Come back from where?

354
00:30:02.921 --> 00:30:04.930
That's what Project Nova's
aims to find out.

355
00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:07.308
I want you to join us Lieutenant.

356
00:30:07.608 --> 00:30:09.810
Help unlock the mysteries
of the Bermuda Triangle.

357
00:30:10.903 --> 00:30:14.725
Sir, I'm a pilot. I don't know
what relevant experience I could offer.

358
00:30:15.923 --> 00:30:17.695
You have more experience than any of us.

359
00:30:19.006 --> 00:30:22.195
You witnessed something extraordinary
out there and you lived to tell the tale.

360
00:30:23.512 --> 00:30:26.578
I don't believe a pilot of your impeccable
record can be taken out of the sky

361
00:30:26.603 --> 00:30:28.804
by a sun flair or freak
mechanical failure, lieutenant.

362
00:30:29.417 --> 00:30:33.301
Sir, I joined up to fly jets
and serve my country.

363
00:30:33.793 --> 00:30:35.099
Not chase windmills.

364
00:30:35.805 --> 00:30:37.337
This is not a fool's crusade.

365
00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:40.114
This is a matter of national security.

366
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.398
All these files contain pictures of people
who have vanished in the Bermuda Triangle.

367
00:30:50.718 --> 00:30:54.313
They are MIA's in an invisible war.
And Tempest Key is the front line.

368
00:30:57.996 --> 00:30:59.006
Yeah?

369
00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:04.080
I'll be right there.

370
00:31:06.028 --> 00:31:08.495
If you want to see how real this is
come with me, lieutenant.

371
00:31:54.516 --> 00:31:56.285
Eva you need to hit
the road or you're never

372
00:31:56.309 --> 00:31:57.691
gonna to make it out
of here before the storm.

373
00:31:57.716 --> 00:31:58.782
Once you lock down, I'll go.

374
00:31:58.807 --> 00:32:01.496
I don't want to come back and find half
our restaurant under water.

375
00:32:04.209 --> 00:32:05.908
I got it, I got it, I got it.

376
00:32:12.711 --> 00:32:15.806
So once you've taken
care of business... ah...

377
00:32:16.805 --> 00:32:19.700
...We should talk to the bank about
a lender upgrade to your boat.

378
00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.492
Oh, great.

379
00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:24.987
Power lines have blown over.

380
00:32:26.492 --> 00:32:27.993
No, it must be the circuit breaker.

381
00:32:28.503 --> 00:32:30.092
Lights are still on at Captain Jack's.

382
00:32:36.483 --> 00:32:39.605
-Are you sure you know what you're doing?
-Yeah, trust me.

383
00:32:41.088 --> 00:32:43.303
Would it kill you to hold
the flashlight steady?

384
00:32:45.407 --> 00:32:46.591
It's very funny, Eva.

385
00:32:54.211 --> 00:32:55.308
Aww.

386
00:32:56.807 --> 00:32:58.395
Couldn't hide forever, Orin.

387
00:33:34.412 --> 00:33:35.507
Eva.

388
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:40.793
Sorry about your friend.
But I'm more concerned about your life now.

389
00:33:41.214 --> 00:33:43.393
McCaffery.
She got you, too?

390
00:34:07.219 --> 00:34:08.307
Where is she taking us?

391
00:34:08.410 --> 00:34:10.995
Home. To Atlantis.

392
00:34:11.415 --> 00:34:12.719
To be executed.

393
00:34:13.793 --> 00:34:15.305
Why hasn't she got us already?

394
00:34:16.392 --> 00:34:18.100
You're a symbol of hope, Orin.

395
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.605
If they kill you,
that hope dies too.

396
00:34:27.496 --> 00:34:31.399
-Then I need water.
-My flask, it's in my boot.

397
00:34:43.903 --> 00:34:44.997
Smash it!

398
00:35:05.691 --> 00:35:08.891
-How do we take her down?
-We aren't doing anything.

399
00:35:09.302 --> 00:35:10.798
You're getting off this boat.

400
00:35:11.204 --> 00:35:12.208
No!

401
00:35:12.306 --> 00:35:14.798
No! That thing took my mom
and attacked my friend.

402
00:35:14.823 --> 00:35:16.491
I'm not going anywhere until she's dead.

403
00:35:16.902 --> 00:35:19.811
I promised your father on his dying breath
I would protect you.

404
00:35:20.311 --> 00:35:22.206
I'm not breaking my word now.

405
00:35:24.289 --> 00:35:25.505
Do you have any weapons?

406
00:35:26.597 --> 00:35:27.910
Nadia.

407
00:35:44.114 --> 00:35:45.500
Your aim's gotten better.

408
00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.607
-Where is Orin?
-Rot in hell you jelly bitch!

409
00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.299
Now, where's Orin?

410
00:36:03.604 --> 00:36:04.911
I'm right here.

411
00:36:28.096 --> 00:36:30.108
Your mother can't protect you this time.

412
00:36:30.899 --> 00:36:32.396
What did you do to her?

413
00:36:33.017 --> 00:36:34.111
You'll find out.

414
00:36:36.905 --> 00:36:38.799
You're coming home, Orin.

415
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.243
Orin?

416
00:36:45.309 --> 00:36:46.409
Not today!

417
00:37:13.106 --> 00:37:14.303
Well done, Orin.

418
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.796
Your father would've been proud.

419
00:37:33.911 --> 00:37:35.089
I'm sorry, Eva.

420
00:37:53.794 --> 00:37:55.901
How much do you
remember, Lieutenant Torres?

421
00:38:23.725 --> 00:38:25.896
You know, that siren
was just the beginning.

422
00:38:27.104 --> 00:38:30.602
There are creatures in the deep you
couldn't imagine in your worst nightmares.

423
00:38:33.706 --> 00:38:35.816
Oh, that’s reassuring. Thanks a lot.

424
00:38:37.092 --> 00:38:38.611
I'm not here to make you feel good.

425
00:38:39.816 --> 00:38:41.405
I'm here to prepare you for the worst.

426
00:38:41.792 --> 00:38:44.190
Look, we should've started
your training years ago.

427
00:38:46.491 --> 00:38:49.502
Then let's do it.
Let's start now.

428
00:38:51.314 --> 00:38:52.399
I'm ready.

429
00:38:55.904 --> 00:38:56.921
A birthday gift.

430
00:39:04.301 --> 00:39:07.698
Kind of feels like a book.
Not really much a reader.

431
00:39:07.723 --> 00:39:08.782
Just open it.

432
00:39:17.222 --> 00:39:20.297
Henry The Fourth Parts I and II. Hmm.

433
00:39:20.791 --> 00:39:22.699
Didn't really know
Shakespeare was into sequels.

434
00:39:23.607 --> 00:39:25.702
I expect for you to have
read them by next week.

435
00:39:27.502 --> 00:39:29.703
Uh, I gave up book reports in sixth grade.

436
00:39:29.728 --> 00:39:31.093
This is part of your training.

437
00:39:33.008 --> 00:39:35.584
Right. See, when you said
training. I thought you meant,

438
00:39:35.898 --> 00:39:38.405
you know, wielding tridents
and doing cool stuff in the water.

439
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:41.089
All in due time. Don't
worry.

440
00:39:41.114 --> 00:39:44.203
There's plenty sex and violence in there
to keep you interested.

441
00:39:45.401 --> 00:39:47.704
Can't you just hit the highlights
and tell me how it ends?

442
00:39:48.407 --> 00:39:53.194
The lesson isn't in the
ending, Orin. It's in the journey.
